00:00.100 --> 00:01.020
Previously on the o.c.

00:01.020 --> 00:04.380
- I was with Johnny.
- He went through something.

00:04.410 --> 00:05.680
Something like
I went through.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.700
Even if Marissa
was accused,

00:07.740 --> 00:08.790
she wouldn't
go to jail.

00:08.830 --> 00:10.930
She also wouldn't
be going to college.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.410
- Look,can we talk?
- Yeah,okay.

00:12.450 --> 00:13.790
- But before you say anything...
- I like you.

00:13.820 --> 00:14.680
Ah... boy.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.700
Seth,I think it's obvious
that we are soul mates.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.760
What were you doing
talking to her?

00:19.930 --> 00:22.440
You were just gonna scam me
into throwing a fake charity

00:22.500 --> 00:24.630
and leave me
to pick up the pieces.

00:24.670 --> 00:25.740
You don't have
any friends here.

00:25.780 --> 00:26.810
Wrong.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.290
I have Kirsten,

00:28.340 --> 00:30.390
and I won't do this to her.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.370 --> 00:46.720
Okay,picture me in college-

00:46.770 --> 00:50.770
ah... big fish in a small pond,
or small fish in a big pond?

00:50.820 --> 00:53.080
I don't know,I never really
pictured you living in a pond.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.030
Me neither. You know,
finding the right college

00:55.080 --> 00:56.460
ought to be
more soulful than this.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.130
Well,you've got to fill it out.
They're due today.

00:58.170 --> 00:59.930
What's due today?

01:00.860 --> 01:02.150
- What's up?
- Hey.

01:02.650 --> 01:04.050
"Picking the
Perfect College. "

01:04.080 --> 01:05.540
Oh,crap!
I totally spaced that!

01:05.580 --> 01:07.160
- Does anyone
have an extra one?
- There you go.

01:07.210 --> 01:10.060
Remember,meeting with the
college counselor today.

01:10.130 --> 01:11.270
That can be
so

01:11.320 --> 01:12.980
I can't even pick out
my shoes in the morning,

01:13.010 --> 01:14.390
let alone plan
the rest of my life.

01:14.420 --> 01:15.740
That's okay,
it's only four years,

01:15.770 --> 01:17.280
and,according
to this brochure,

01:17.320 --> 01:20.260
it's supposed to be the high point
of an otherwise miserable existence.

01:20.290 --> 01:21.880
Well,these kids
look pretty happy.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.670
Look,Coop,two girls
looking in a microscope

01:23.710 --> 01:25.180
and smiling-
that could be us.

01:25.230 --> 01:27.810
Mm,yeah,I don't think so.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.240
- Coop,are you okay?
- Of course she's okay.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.490
She gets
to leave Newport.

01:30.550 --> 01:31.910
We all do.
Think about this.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.680
Pretty soon,we're
going to be living in real cities

01:33.740 --> 01:37.070
with,like,real,non-Botox,non-plastic people.

01:37.110 --> 01:38.560
- Cohen,shut up.
- And weather.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.920
How about,like,a little
weather for a change.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.240
You know what I mean?
I'm not talking about

01:42.260 --> 01:43.820
it's "cloudy with a chance
of drizzle" weather,

01:43.840 --> 01:45.870
I'm talking about "snowstorm,

01:45.920 --> 01:47.960
seal your windows
with duct tape" weather.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.450
- That's what I want.
- You know,guys,

01:49.500 --> 01:51.320
it's getting late.
I think I'm just going to go.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.910
You all right?
Did I mention I'd get to wear wool?

01:52.950 --> 01:55.020
I would actually get to
wear a real wool sweater?

01:55.060 --> 01:56.150
Shut up!

01:56.180 --> 01:57.240
Okay.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.650
- Coop,what's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:58.690 --> 02:00.800
I mean,
this whole college thing,

02:00.840 --> 02:02.430
it's great for you guys.

02:02.460 --> 02:04.470
I'm just not going to
get to be a part of it.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.970
What are you talking about?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.690
Look,I've done the research.

02:07.730 --> 02:10.120
With my background,my history,

02:10.150 --> 02:12.090
I don't have a chance
at getting in.

02:12.980 --> 02:15.030
I'm just...
not going to college.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.570
That's all.

02:18.110 --> 02:20.740
And there's
a different approach.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.340
The O.C.

02:27.350 --> 02:41.050
-S03E08-

02:48.530 --> 02:54.010
-=The Game Plan=-

02:54.050 --> 02:56.380
So,what's on
the agenda today?

02:56.420 --> 02:58.120
Oh,it's packed.
You don't want to know.

02:58.150 --> 02:59.520
Sure I do.

02:59.660 --> 03:02.640
Okay,conference call
with the zoning board,

03:02.680 --> 03:04.380
lunch with a couple
of investors...

03:04.410 --> 03:07.050
I gotta oversee Ramsey's presentation
for tomorrow's meeting.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.770
- Want me to go on?
- I do.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.790
Believe it or not,
it sounds exciting.

03:10.820 --> 03:13.930
What,more so than
perfecting the art of souffl\?

03:14.000 --> 03:18.090
Speaking of,that one you made
last night,it was top-notch.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.250
- Sandy,I'm going crazy.
- What?

03:21.270 --> 03:23.550
It's the sifting,
the kneading,the measuring.

03:23.590 --> 03:26.030
I can't take it anymore.
I need to get out of the kitchen.

03:26.060 --> 03:26.750
Honey.

03:26.780 --> 03:28.460
It's-it's not
the cooking I hate.

03:28.490 --> 03:29.490
It's the quiet.

03:29.530 --> 03:31.570
We'll,we're gonna have
to get used to a quiet house.

03:31.610 --> 03:32.320
I know.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.820
The boys started filling out
their college forms today.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.330
Well,look on
the up side.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.560
Seth will be right
up the road at Berkeley.

03:38.590 --> 03:40.990
Oh,I wouldn't be so sure.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.430
Remember,before
Ryan came,

03:42.470 --> 03:45.400
Seth was dead set on going to
a boarding school on the East Coast.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.650
He wants out
of California.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.320
That was years ago.
He was a kid.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.760
Sandy...

03:49.870 --> 03:52.470
Seth has never said
that he wants to go to Berkeley.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.230
But he never said he didn't.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.220
Try not to go
too stir-crazy.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.880
I'll try.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.480
Marissa!

04:08.580 --> 04:09.410
Brace yourself.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.920
You,my friend,are
in the presence of a celebrity.

04:12.950 --> 04:14.450
I am?
Harper,here,

04:14.490 --> 04:17.339
is moments away from
being a surfing legend.

04:17.370 --> 04:19.279
Come on,man,I still have
to make it though this weekend.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.290
And assuming that
you shred it out there,

04:21.320 --> 04:23.820
you'll be picked for
Pac West's 2006 team.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.060
Oh,well,that's great.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.710
Congratulations.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.260
Cooper! A little
enthusiasm,buddy.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.300
This is a banner day
for Dennis Childress.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.090
It's a banner day for you?

04:33.120 --> 04:34.700
Yeah! You might get
to be the star,

04:34.730 --> 04:36.420
but I get to be
the entourage.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.980
Which is a way better
deal,anyways.

04:38.020 --> 04:40.350
We're talking free swag,
VIP parties,

04:40.400 --> 04:41.670
crashing your
world tour.

04:41.710 --> 04:42.850
I had no idea.

04:42.890 --> 04:44.610
Someone's got
to carry your surfboard.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.810
Well,I'll be there to watch you
in your moment of glory.

04:47.860 --> 04:49.080
Are you all right?

04:49.110 --> 04:51.720
- You seem a little,uh...
- I'm fine. Promise.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.100
Look,I'll see you
guys later,okay?

04:55.720 --> 04:56.690
Something's
wrong with her.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.850
Poor kid's probably
star-struck.

04:58.870 --> 05:00.500
Get used to it.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.340
So we'll deal with grades
and boards later,

05:07.370 --> 05:10.640
but for now,I just want
to get a feel for what you want,

05:10.670 --> 05:12.570
you know,where you
imagine yourself.

05:12.620 --> 05:13.740
Uh,somewhere cold.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.520
Or brisk.
I would settle for brisk.

05:15.550 --> 05:17.990
I want 365 sundaes...

05:18.030 --> 05:20.070
and don't mean
the day after Saturday.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.490
Uh...

05:21.600 --> 05:24.520
Not someplace too big,
but not a lot of sports,

05:24.550 --> 05:26.140
not a lot of big guys
playing sports.

05:26.170 --> 05:28.430
I definitely want
to join a sorority.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.180
Oh,but I don't
want to learn Greek.

05:30.210 --> 05:31.620
- Where are you thinking?
- I don't know.

05:31.650 --> 05:33.720
I've only lived in California.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.520
Hawaii,Arizona...

05:35.540 --> 05:36.810
Uh,Boston,Connecticut,

05:36.830 --> 05:38.700
Vermont,Maine,
Rhode Island or New Hampshire.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.120
Ooh!
Do they have a college in Cabo?

05:41.140 --> 05:42.430
I'm not sure.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.780
Uh,I guess this sounds like I
haven't given it a lot of thought,

05:46.810 --> 05:49.950
but the truth of the matter is,
I-I have. Uh...

05:50.500 --> 05:53.130
I'll be the first in my family
to graduate from high school,

05:53.160 --> 05:54.750
let alone go to college.

05:54.790 --> 05:58.250
So,I mean,this whole...

06:00.110 --> 06:02.010
It's a lot.

06:04.950 --> 06:06.340
It's just so odd

06:06.370 --> 06:09.540
that Charlotte just up and left
without so much as a phone call.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.750
Well,you know,
her father called.

06:11.790 --> 06:12.920
He said it was an emergency

06:12.960 --> 06:14.440
and that's all
she needed to hear.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.000
Julie,she hasn't spoken
to her father in years.

06:17.030 --> 06:18.400
Well,you know how
it is with family.

06:18.430 --> 06:21.230
One day you're estranged,
next,you're bugs in a rug.

06:21.270 --> 06:22.690
But enough
about Charlotte.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.010
How are you?

06:24.070 --> 06:26.530
Oh,it's just,I'm...

06:26.680 --> 06:28.700
I'm losing my mind at home.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.720
I feel like...

06:33.950 --> 06:36.950
Julie,are you even
listening to this?

06:37.120 --> 06:39.210
Yes,of course.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.920
Is there something
you need to tell me?

06:42.850 --> 06:44.480
Excuse me.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.320
Ms. Cooper.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.140
This is the last time
I'm going to warn you.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.820
I need that rent check.

06:59.860 --> 07:03.070
$10,000 or this
could get very ugly.

07:03.110 --> 07:04.780
Is everything okay?

07:04.840 --> 07:06.310
I don't need any,thanks.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.570
Hello,I don't need
any steak knives.

07:09.610 --> 07:11.280
You want some coffee cake?

07:13.890 --> 07:15.470
- Hey,man.
- What's up?

07:15.520 --> 07:19.020
You going to visit me
in Providence next year?

07:20.010 --> 07:21.370
Going to Rhode Island.

07:21.420 --> 07:23.200
Brown. University.
Mm-hmm.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.280
I just had a meeting
with the counselor.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.870
She said I had a very good shot
of getting in,'cause I'm awesome.

07:26.910 --> 07:28.780
- This your first choice?
- Dude,it's my only choice.

07:28.820 --> 07:30.620
It's liberal,
it's turtleneck weather,

07:30.660 --> 07:33.050
and most importantly,
it's 3,000 miles away from here.

07:33.090 --> 07:35.310
So it's safe to say
you're not applying to Berkeley-

07:35.360 --> 07:36.720
you told your dad yet?

07:36.740 --> 07:38.310
Sandy Cohen's
a perceptive guy.

07:38.340 --> 07:39.680
I'm sure he'll figure it out.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.540
Seth,you got
to tell him.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.530
Dad,I'm not applying
to Berkeley.

07:45.060 --> 07:46.550
Where'd you get a gun?

07:46.590 --> 07:47.650
Why do you have this gun?

07:47.680 --> 07:51.090
Mm,mm,that doesn't have
a good ring to it.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.890
It doesn't have
a good ring. Fine.

07:54.190 --> 07:56.670
I'll stop by after school,
I'll break it to him.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.570
At least you're
going to college.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.860
Unlike a lanky lady friend
of yours?

07:59.900 --> 08:02.630
I don't get it,I mean,

08:02.660 --> 08:04.480
she's always wanted
to go to college,you know?

08:04.530 --> 08:06.130
Well,you could talk to her.

08:06.170 --> 08:07.980
You could use your powers
of persuasion.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.310
I don't have any-
ever since I got back to Harbor,

08:10.350 --> 08:11.870
it's like I don't
have a leg to stand on.

08:11.910 --> 08:14.130
Then you need to find
somebody who does.

08:14.170 --> 08:16.160
You need to get yourself
an ally.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.800
Why are you doing that?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.160
Because I don't give a crap
about this school.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.150
I'm out of here.

08:33.150 --> 08:34.750
Summer,feel my forehead.

08:34.789 --> 08:35.809
What? Why?

08:35.840 --> 08:37.940
I have college fever.
Don't you?

08:37.980 --> 08:39.549
Maybe. What are the symptoms?

08:39.590 --> 08:41.760
You become incredibly annoying?

08:42.110 --> 08:43.860
Summer,cheer up.

08:43.919 --> 08:46.430
You're just gonna
love Arizona.

08:46.490 --> 08:47.710
Oops.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.560
How do you know that
I'm applying there?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.600
I work in the college
counseling office.

08:51.640 --> 08:52.960
Um,I do a lot of filing.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.420
Oh,and snooping.

08:54.470 --> 08:56.710
Well,I did notice
that you and Seth

08:56.740 --> 08:59.110
are headed to opposite
ends of the country.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.200
Yeah,well,we
have different tastes.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.400
Yeah,apparently-
he wants to go to Brown,

09:03.440 --> 09:06.900
and you want to go someplace sunny
where kids drink till they vomit.

09:06.930 --> 09:08.350
Taylor,do you
have a point?

09:08.390 --> 09:10.300
I'm just sad for you,is all.

09:10.340 --> 09:13.840
You know,I mean,the long-distance
thing can be such a grind.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.260
Oh,what am I
talking about?

09:15.300 --> 09:18.190
I'm sure you and Seth have
a whole plan worked out.

09:18.230 --> 09:20.490
- A plan?
- Yeah.

09:20.530 --> 09:23.170
Well,Seth wouldn't just
skedaddle off to the East Coast

09:23.200 --> 09:25.840
without so much as a thought
to your relationship.

09:25.870 --> 09:26.770
Would he?

09:26.810 --> 09:29.460
Look,no one is
skedaddling anywhere yet,okay?

09:29.490 --> 09:32.010
Well,if you two haven't
even talked about this yet,

09:32.050 --> 09:34.410
my guess is there's
stormy weather ahead.

09:34.460 --> 09:36.050
xxx

09:36.090 --> 09:38.440
It's a tricky business.

09:47.410 --> 09:48.870
Dad.

09:49.020 --> 09:51.770
I didn't know you'd be
dropping by today.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.290
Yeah,well...

09:54.660 --> 09:56.330
you know,I had kind of
a big day at school.

09:56.370 --> 09:59.390
I know,I know,you had a meeting
with your college counselor.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.320
I'm dying to hear about it.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.530
Well,you know,she said that
I actually have a lot of options.

10:04.580 --> 10:05.810
Well,of course you do.

10:05.850 --> 10:08.360
And whatever you decide,
I'll respect.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.030
- Good.
- Listen

10:09.070 --> 10:11.790
I'm just happy you're even
considering Berkeley.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.280
You are.
Well,aren't you?

10:14.310 --> 10:16.100
Yeah,considering? Sure.

10:16.130 --> 10:17.080
- Great.
- Yeah.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.410
Listen,as long as it's still
on the table,I'm happy.

10:21.770 --> 10:22.630
berkeley.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.710
Okay,I'm glad
we got this all cleared up.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.690
I'm gonna see you back at the house.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.970
Oh,okay,all right.

10:29.010 --> 10:29.960
You got it.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.110
Good talk.
You... yep.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.030
Hey,Sheryl.

10:39.050 --> 10:42.090
Yeah,will you get Paul Glass
at Berkeley on the line for me?

10:50.740 --> 10:51.910
Hey.

10:51.940 --> 10:53.580
Thanks for coming
to get me.

10:53.690 --> 10:54.430
Not a problem.

10:54.470 --> 10:55.450
Hey,whoa,whoa,whoa.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.930
You want to hang out
for a minute?

10:57.160 --> 10:59.330
What,you just want
to enjoy the scenery?

10:59.370 --> 11:01.410
I wanted to talk to you
about college.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.680
Look,I already told you I'm
not going.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.280
I know,I know,
you're not going.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.400
You could talk to somebody.

11:06.840 --> 11:10.040
Sorry,I sort of overheard
what you were talking about.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.070
Hey,man,
what are you doing here?

11:11.110 --> 11:14.400
I was trying to convince Marissa
to see her guidance counselor.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.160
Oh,Mitchell Davison.
He's a great guy.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.080
That's what I hear.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.540
That's what you hear?

11:20.850 --> 11:22.640
From who?

11:28.580 --> 11:30.020
Oh,my God.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.260
You guys planned this,
didn't you?

11:31.290 --> 11:34.840
Look,we just...we didn't want you
to do something you might regret.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.400
So you conspired
to get me here?

11:37.440 --> 11:39.090
To lecture me on what
to do with my

11:39.130 --> 11:41.840
- Come on,it's not like that.
- I mean,I thought I could talk to you.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.050
- I thought you were on my side
- I'm on your side.

11:44.090 --> 11:47.540
Trust me.
Just... leave me alone.

11:52.860 --> 11:54.880
Oh,man,it'll be
great to see you.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.560
Yeah,that's right.
Tomorrow night.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.480
I'll see you then.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.090
All right,Paul.
Bye.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.110
Who's that?

12:00.170 --> 12:02.500
Our old friend,
Paul Glass.

12:02.530 --> 12:04.690
Paul Glass,as in Paul
Glass from Berkeley?

12:04.730 --> 12:07.900
Well,not from anymore,at-
he's working there now.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.470
What,what?
He called me.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.650
Besides,Seth came by the office
yesterday to talk colleges.

12:12.690 --> 12:13.800
He seems interested
in Cal.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.610
As long as you
don't pressure him.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.770
No. No pressure.

12:17.940 --> 12:20.200
A nudge.
A father's allowed to nudge.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.000
Nudging's allowed,
but any more than that

12:22.040 --> 12:24.380
and I will confiscate
your Cal sweatshirt.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.580
- You wouldn't dare.
- Try me.

12:26.780 --> 12:27.590
Oh,I gotta go.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.260
I'm going to try and make
a cardio bar class.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.670
Cardio bar is crawling with Newpsies
- how bored are you?

12:32.720 --> 12:34.740
Well,I thought I'd go,
'cause Julie loves it,

12:34.770 --> 12:36.100
and I thought it
might cheer her up.

12:36.140 --> 12:39.640
Lately she seems...
not herself.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.300
- Is that a bad thing?
- I'm serious,Sandy.

12:42.350 --> 12:43.730
She's keeping something from me.

12:43.770 --> 12:44.710
Well,when it comes
to Julie Cooper,

12:44.750 --> 12:46.980
sometimes it's better
not knowing.

12:47.020 --> 12:47.880
Yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.120
Well,whatever.
Let's go.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.800
- You look very sporty.
- Thank you.

12:53.830 --> 12:55.170
So,how did it go
with Marissa?

12:55.190 --> 12:57.250
Basically accused me
and Johnny of ganging up on her

12:57.280 --> 12:58.870
- and she stormed off
- Oh,so it went well.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.870
I don't know;
I guess it's to be expected.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.330
We'll all be splitting up
next year;

13:02.360 --> 13:03.370
it's bound
to make everybody tense.

13:03.410 --> 13:05.170
Okay,but why focus
on the negative?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.690
This is a cause for celebration.

13:06.730 --> 13:08.460
We get to finally leave Newport.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.840
Well,I'm not sure everybody sees
that as something to celebrate.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.660
What,you want to stay in
Orange County forever?

13:12.690 --> 13:15.120
Grow old playing golf and
chatting about the NASDAQ?

13:15.150 --> 13:18.380
No,I'm just saying,you know,
maybe Newport isn't all evil.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.650
Name me one thing about Newport
that isn't evil.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.800
I will name you two.

13:21.830 --> 13:22.780
Cohen. Hi.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.800
You,me,
upstairs,now.

13:25.390 --> 13:27.300
Tell my parents
I love them.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.990
- How are you?
- Better,thanks.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.890
Look,I'm sorry
about yesterday.

13:36.940 --> 13:39.120
I... I didn't mean to...
pressure you.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.050
You know,I realized after,

13:40.100 --> 13:41.930
you were probably
just trying to help.

13:42.210 --> 13:44.940
So I made an appointment with
the college guidance counselor.

13:44.980 --> 13:46.490
All right! You did!

13:46.530 --> 13:49.480
I mean,I can't promise anything
but I'm going to try.

13:55.350 --> 13:58.490
These are our college lists.
Do you see a difference?

14:00.470 --> 14:01.180
Yeah,the font.

14:01.210 --> 14:03.500
Looks like you went
with the Times New Roman.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.290
The schools,dufus!

14:05.350 --> 14:06.220
None of them are
the same.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.080
None of them are even
in the same time zone.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.790
Okay,so,you know,
you want West Coast,

14:09.820 --> 14:11.720
I want East Coast;
it's not a hip-hop war.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.310
We are going
to be separated by,like,

14:13.350 --> 14:14.810
a zillion billion miles.

14:14.830 --> 14:17.190
I was up all last night
thinking about that.

14:17.230 --> 14:18.820
You were?

14:18.990 --> 14:22.010
You haven't even given this
a second thought,have you?

14:23.170 --> 14:26.100
- Summer,wait a second...
- No. Too late,Cohen.

14:40.460 --> 14:41.540
Julie!

14:41.580 --> 14:43.390
You're leaving us
already?

14:43.600 --> 14:45.960
Uh,well,you know,

14:45.990 --> 14:47.600
I was only staying
here temporarily.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.330
I'm renovating my place
in Balboa Estates.

14:50.380 --> 14:52.340
You know,I couldn't
stand the racket.

14:52.570 --> 14:55.620
You live in the Balboa Estates
and you drive your own U-Haul?

14:55.670 --> 14:57.770
I'm just keeping it real.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.430
Well,gotta go.
See you round.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.750
3- F.

15:33.570 --> 15:35.680
Mrs. Rushfield. Hi.

15:35.750 --> 15:39.520
I wanted to read up on a school.
Brown.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.440
I know,it's a major reach,

15:41.470 --> 15:43.080
but it doesn't hurt
to look,right?

15:43.110 --> 15:43.870
Of course.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.060
Let me just get
the file for you.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.330
Thanks.

15:49.710 --> 15:51.660
That's been checked out.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.060
Here you go.

15:53.090 --> 15:55.370
Oh,this is just what
we were looking for.

15:55.410 --> 15:56.940
Thank you,Taylor.

15:57.670 --> 15:59.580
Here you go.

16:01.270 --> 16:03.290
- You're applying to Brown?
- Maybe.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.250
Well,I'm sure they would
just love to have you.

16:05.310 --> 16:07.590
I hear the Ivys often recruit
from Fred Segal.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.420
I can get into Brown
if I want to.

16:09.450 --> 16:10.390
Of course you can.

16:10.420 --> 16:13.720
And on the off chance that you don't
you can always come and visit.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.670
Seth and I will show you around.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.550
You have the grades.

16:19.590 --> 16:21.070
Lots of activities.

16:21.110 --> 16:24.210
My guess is,
you'll be fine.

16:24.810 --> 16:27.900
Except... I'm not
sure I want to go.

16:27.930 --> 16:31.250
I'm sorry,Marissa.
I'm a little confused.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.570
What are we doing here?

16:37.580 --> 16:39.470
Does this have anything
to do with,uh,

16:39.500 --> 16:41.960
what happened
to you over the summer?

16:42.290 --> 16:45.230
I read about it
in your file.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.850
It's just,I'd have
to explain it,wouldn't I?

16:48.890 --> 16:51.820
Well,on the applications,yes.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.990
You will have to say
why you were expelled.

16:54.030 --> 16:55.700
But if it means
getting into college,

16:55.740 --> 16:58.060
it seems like
a small price to pay.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.580
I've just spent all this time
trying to forget about it.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.830
And,you know,if I had
to drudge it up again,

17:03.880 --> 17:05.670
I don't know if
I could handle it.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.099
I get it.

17:07.150 --> 17:10.970
That's a tough skeleton
to have in your closet.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.920
But,if you want my
advice,write about it.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.640
See what comes out.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.170
Well,that's exactly what
I don't want to do.

17:19.210 --> 17:20.240
Marissa...

17:20.500 --> 17:22.750
you can't run away
from your past.

17:22.790 --> 17:26.470
So,before you let it
ruin your future,

17:26.640 --> 17:29.630
you might try
learning to live with it.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.160
Oh,excuse me.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.720
Could I get a little help
over here?

18:04.760 --> 18:06.800
I ain't no bellman,lady.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.420
How charming.

18:08.510 --> 18:09.800
I take it you're my landlord?

18:09.840 --> 18:12.030
Yep,I'm Gus.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.140
Welcome to the Taj Mahal.

18:19.290 --> 18:20.890
I can't believe I'm back here.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.720
You lived here before?

18:22.770 --> 18:24.540
I'm speaking figuratively.

18:24.590 --> 18:26.080
The truth is,

18:26.240 --> 18:28.460
I moved out of a place like this
when I was 18.

18:28.490 --> 18:31.240
I never thought I'd be back.

18:31.370 --> 18:35.470
Yeah,well,when I was a kid,

18:35.520 --> 18:38.850
I wanted to be wide receiver
for the Chargers.

18:39.180 --> 18:42.270
Sometimes life don't work out.

20:22.420 --> 20:24.910
Everyone's here- perfect!

20:24.940 --> 20:26.970
Hey,a college buddy of
mine,Paul Glass,is in town.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.320
I invited him over
for dinner tonight.

20:29.370 --> 20:30.800
And what brings Paul to town?

20:30.850 --> 20:34.110
- Oh,something to do with work.
- Something for Berkeley?

20:34.150 --> 20:35.350
Your friend works
at Berkeley?

20:35.380 --> 20:37.440
- It's not what you think.
- You mean an ambush?

20:37.470 --> 20:40.400
A resource. You guys
might enjoy talking to him.

20:40.420 --> 20:42.170
It sounds like an ambush.

20:44.570 --> 20:47.320
It's dinner.
They have to eat.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.630
Hey.

20:57.680 --> 20:58.760
What are you guys
doing here?

20:58.790 --> 21:01.300
Pack West Surf Contest.
Today's the day.Remember?

21:01.330 --> 21:04.430
Oh... you know,that's okay.

21:04.490 --> 21:07.080
- I don't want to be a downer.
- Why? What's up?

21:12.820 --> 21:14.570
If I can't write
the essay,

21:14.610 --> 21:16.820
you know,I may as well
forget about college.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.330
So forget it.
Come on tour with us.

21:19.370 --> 21:20.840
- What?
- That's not a bad idea

21:20.870 --> 21:23.490
you know,travel the world,give
yourself some time to think.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.420
Are you serious?

21:24.450 --> 21:27.220
Look,maybe you just need
to take the pressure off.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.640
You know?
Give yourself some time.

21:30.130 --> 21:32.390
Why not do it in Fiji?

21:33.370 --> 21:36.370
Just come to the contest today,
see what you think.

21:37.810 --> 21:39.810
All right,give me
five minutes.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.170
Was that Johnny and Dog Boy
downstairs?

21:50.210 --> 21:53.520
Yeah,Johnny's got this,uh,
big surf contest today.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.310
I'm gonna go support him.

21:55.350 --> 21:57.510
Huh. What about your essay?

21:57.560 --> 21:58.940
You know,you can
use my computer.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.790
Just be gentle with it.

22:00.840 --> 22:05.560
Yeah... that might be
put off for a while.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.590
What are you talking about?

22:19.310 --> 22:21.120
Hello

22:21.380 --> 22:23.730
Hey,Julie.
Glad you were free.

22:23.780 --> 22:25.170
Well,I can't stay long.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.590
Did I tell you
I'm moving?

22:26.640 --> 22:29.090
It's such a hassle
- but the new place,it's beautiful.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.090
Well,then I'll get
right to it.

22:31.990 --> 22:34.180
How would you like
to go into business together?

22:34.230 --> 22:36.130
- What?
- Well,think about it.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.220
The magazine,the fund-raiser.

22:38.270 --> 22:39.840
We'd make a good team.

22:39.870 --> 22:41.370
Kirsten...

22:41.470 --> 22:43.600
I don't need your charity.

22:44.600 --> 22:48.130
Then... why are you living
in a trailer?

22:48.190 --> 22:49.230
I'm sorry.

22:49.260 --> 22:51.100
I followed you yesterday.

22:51.140 --> 22:54.210
Well,then I certainly hope
you're opening a detective agency.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.870
It's not charity.

22:55.910 --> 22:57.860
I'm going crazy doing nothing.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.580
Id this.

23:00.810 --> 23:02.000
Well...

23:02.930 --> 23:05.630
if you I guess.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.280
just one thing

23:09.320 --> 23:11.580
If we're gonna be partners,I need
to know what happened to Charlotte.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.650
She can't be with her dad;
she hates her dad.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.930
Oh,God,she didn't
relapse,did she?

23:21.190 --> 23:24.160
No,she couldn't
- because she's not an alcoholic.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.280
What are you talking about?

23:26.320 --> 23:30.320
Oh,Kirsten,I never
wanted to tell you this.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.140
Charlotte...

23:32.180 --> 23:34.890
went to rehab
to find a...

23:35.070 --> 23:39.820
rich,vulnerable woman
she could exploit.

23:39.850 --> 23:40.950
She's a con artist.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.110
I'm so sorry.

23:43.180 --> 23:45.040
But the fund-raiser...

23:45.200 --> 23:46.180
A scam.

23:46.220 --> 23:48.430
She was planning on taking
that money with her.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.130
But I stopped her
at the last minute.

23:53.470 --> 23:55.370
Oh,my God.

23:58.780 --> 24:00.040
You were in on it?

24:00.080 --> 24:01.770
Kirsten...

24:02.130 --> 24:04.640
Kirsten,let
me explain.

24:10.630 --> 24:11.420
What is it,Cohen?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.910
We need to talk.

24:13.170 --> 24:14.920
I brought visual aids.

24:18.350 --> 24:19.810
Boarding school stuff?

24:19.850 --> 24:23.700
My entire life,I have wanted to get
as far away from Newport as possible,

24:23.750 --> 24:26.090
and the only
reason I didn't

24:26.120 --> 24:28.380
is because Ryan came and
you started talking to me.

24:28.410 --> 24:31.030
And I'm very glad
I stayed- but...

24:31.140 --> 24:32.870
now I have to go

24:32.910 --> 24:34.600
Fine. I get it.

24:34.630 --> 24:36.040
But what's your plan
for us?

24:36.080 --> 24:39.230
mails,phone calls,see each other
once every two months?

24:39.260 --> 24:40.760
Or...

24:42.040 --> 24:44.660
Or you could come with me.

24:44.690 --> 24:45.630
No.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.400
You've always wanted
to go east;

24:47.440 --> 24:49.260
I've always wanted
to stay west.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.840
- Well,but don't you think...
- But what?

24:50.880 --> 24:53.190
My dreams are not as important
as yours?

24:53.230 --> 24:55.750
Summer,I'm trying
to make this work.

24:55.780 --> 24:56.990
I feel like you're just
writing this off.

24:57.030 --> 24:59.620
You don't see Ryan
and Marissa giving up.

24:59.660 --> 25:01.420
Not yet,anyway.

25:01.470 --> 25:03.260
What does that mean?

25:21.620 --> 25:23.570
I'm telling you,man,there
is no shame in playing it safe.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.300
- Marissa,tell him.
- Tell him what?

25:25.340 --> 25:27.900
Nine months of our lives,
Costa Rica,Fiji,Hawaii-

25:27.930 --> 25:29.900
it all rides on today.

25:29.940 --> 25:31.620
Way to take
the pressure off,man.

25:31.650 --> 25:33.520
Hey,you're gonna be
great out there.

25:33.550 --> 25:35.550
Thanks. Got to get
to the staging area.

25:35.590 --> 25:36.860
See you guys later.

25:36.950 --> 25:38.260
Bye.

25:39.990 --> 25:40.730
So...

25:40.760 --> 25:42.690
is this what next year
is gonna be like?

25:42.720 --> 25:46.030
Just hanging out on the beach,
watching Johnny surf?

25:46.060 --> 25:48.340
That and scoring
hot foreign babes.

25:48.370 --> 25:49.410
Great.

25:50.010 --> 25:51.260
By the way,
I forgot to tell you.

25:51.310 --> 25:52.440
I talked to some people
that I know-

25:52.480 --> 25:55.720
they think they can get you a job
as a label rep for the tour.

25:55.760 --> 25:56.750
- Wow.
- Yeah.

25:56.790 --> 25:58.620
So if you're serious
about it,

25:58.660 --> 26:00.900
let me know,
I'll make it happen.

26:10.790 --> 26:12.210
- Hey,man.
- Hi.

26:12.250 --> 26:13.490
What's up?

26:13.550 --> 26:15.110
Everything all right?

26:16.650 --> 26:21.440
You would think that
we could deal with next year...

26:21.480 --> 26:23.970
I don't know,next year,
but no-

26:24.000 --> 26:25.500
it's got to screw up
this year,too.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.370
Yeah,Marissa and I have
some of that,too.

26:28.540 --> 26:30.620
Yeah. By the way,have
you spoken to her today?

26:30.650 --> 26:34.910
No. I was on my way to see if
she wanted to grab lunch. Why?

26:35.100 --> 26:35.740
Have a seat.

26:35.790 --> 26:38.650
I don't want to tell you this
standing up.

26:55.700 --> 26:56.830
Thanks for coming,Taylor.

26:56.860 --> 26:58.760
Well,it was no problem
at all,Summer.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.540
I just wanted to talk to you
about next year.

27:00.580 --> 27:02.150
First of all,let me just say that

27:02.190 --> 27:04.820
where I apply to college
is frankly none of your business,

27:04.850 --> 27:08.210
and if some of those schools
happen to cross with Seth's,well...

27:08.250 --> 27:09.310
Taylor.

27:09.340 --> 27:11.650
Shut up,okay?

27:12.160 --> 27:13.320
You can have him.

27:13.370 --> 27:15.720
Go to Brown or wherever
you smart people go.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.240
He's yours.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.390
- This is a ploy,isn't it?
- No. It's life.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.930
He's going to Rhode Island,
and I'm going to Arizona.

27:25.970 --> 27:28.510
I- I just thought you guys would
do the whole long-distance thing.

27:28.540 --> 27:29.930
Please,and struggle along?

27:29.980 --> 27:32.020
Break up at Thanksgiving
and hook up at Christmas,

27:32.050 --> 27:34.600
and then break up again in January
when we're both back at school?

27:34.640 --> 27:36.480
But you could still apply
to a school near to him.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.270
Could you imagine me
on the seat coast?

27:38.310 --> 27:39.840
I'd be like one of those
animals that they rip

27:39.880 --> 27:41.750
from their natural habitat
and put in the zoo.

27:41.800 --> 27:45.460
My fur would get all mangy,I'd
throw dung at people,it'd be awful.

27:45.590 --> 27:48.260
Uh-huh. You know,
I'm almost offended

27:48.300 --> 27:52.160
that you think I would believe
that sort of idiotic lie.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.790
You want the truth,Taylor?

27:57.970 --> 28:00.250
What if he goes to college
and meets a bunch

28:00.290 --> 28:03.550
of really smart
and interesting girls

28:03.590 --> 28:07.370
and realizes that that's
who he's supposed to be with?

28:07.470 --> 28:10.740
And that,uh,you're just
his high school girlfriend.

28:10.780 --> 28:13.680
You're cute and you're
fun to be with,but,um,

28:13.950 --> 28:17.000
doesn't want his kids
to have your DNA?

28:17.520 --> 28:19.150
Yeah.

28:20.540 --> 28:23.340
Maybe we should just end it,
you know?

28:23.380 --> 28:24.100
Summer...

28:24.140 --> 28:26.700
You be nice to him,okay?

28:37.830 --> 28:39.150
Dude,that was
so awesome.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.770
Yeah,you were amazing.

28:40.810 --> 28:41.940
I caught some
good waves.

28:41.980 --> 28:43.930
Oh-ho,and modest.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.470
I'm gonna go see when they're
announcing the teams. All right.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.300
I'm gonna call my mom,
let her know how I did.

28:49.340 --> 28:51.530
She's working up in
San Jose this weekend.

29:05.790 --> 29:08.260
- Hey.
- Hey. Heard you were here.

29:08.310 --> 29:10.960
- Yeah,Johnny was competing.
- What's going on?

29:11.010 --> 29:13.380
Last night you said you wanted
to go to college,and now

29:13.410 --> 29:14.980
you're doing this?

29:15.020 --> 29:18.120
Look,Ryan,I tried to write the essay.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.800
I- I couldn't.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.130
Okay,well,I'll help you.

29:21.170 --> 29:24.050
No,I really don't
think you can.

29:24.370 --> 29:25.610
Hey,Ryan!

29:25.640 --> 29:27.400
Thanks for coming,man.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.430
What's up?

29:30.470 --> 29:32.150
Did you tell Marissa she should
blow off college?

29:32.210 --> 29:32.820
Of course not.

29:32.860 --> 29:35.120
Okay,then explain
what you're doing here.

29:35.150 --> 29:36.730
Dude,no offense,
but...

29:36.760 --> 29:39.890
maybe you just don't understand
what she's going through.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.190
Is that what you think?

29:42.230 --> 29:44.930
No. Okay,I think
it's complicated.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.780
everybody?!

29:52.150 --> 29:54.750
All right,we're about to announce
this year's Pack West Surf Team,

29:54.780 --> 29:58.560
but before we do that,let's give it up
for those surfers out there,huh?

29:59.490 --> 30:00.700
Johnny!

30:01.320 --> 30:04.170
Hey,look,can
we talk about this later?

30:04.210 --> 30:06.620
You know what?
You two talk. I'm done.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.480
Johnny!

30:08.940 --> 30:10.170
No,wait.

30:10.220 --> 30:11.850
Johnny!

30:12.160 --> 30:13.690
I'll get him.

30:14.190 --> 30:15.170
Ryen

30:17.980 --> 30:19.470
Johnny!

30:20.480 --> 30:22.480
of this year's
team is Johnny Harper!

30:22.520 --> 30:24.850
Johnny Harper,where are you?

30:27.330 --> 30:28.800
Somebody call an ambulance!

30:46.690 --> 30:48.110
Were you all with Johnny Harper?

30:48.160 --> 30:50.490
Yeah.
He's going to be okay,right?

30:50.540 --> 30:52.000
Uh,does he have a parent here?

30:52.030 --> 30:53.700
Um,his mom's flying in
from San Jose.

30:53.740 --> 30:54.350
How is he?

30:54.390 --> 30:55.490
Lucky.

30:55.530 --> 30:57.190
The only real damage
is to his knee.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.990
There's been a clean tear of
the ACL,some bone damage.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.290
He's going to require surgery.

31:01.330 --> 31:02.610
When's he going to be able
to surf again?

31:02.660 --> 31:04.020
I'm less worried
about him surfing

31:04.060 --> 31:06.250
than when he's going
to walk again.

31:08.190 --> 31:10.840
He'll be awake in an hour
if you want to see him.

31:14.850 --> 31:16.800
xxx

31:17.370 --> 31:18.280
It's my fault.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.910
He was coming after me
when he got hit.

31:19.950 --> 31:22.870
Ryan,let's not
do this now,okay?

31:25.490 --> 31:27.580
You should probably go.

31:27.630 --> 31:30.460
Sandy will be wondering
where you are.

31:32.550 --> 31:35.640
I think
I should go find Chili.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.310
I'll call you.

31:43.010 --> 31:45.090
Kirsten,look who I found.

31:45.130 --> 31:47.550
I heard this is where Newport's
newest culinary talent lives.

31:47.590 --> 31:49.680
Oh,Paul,it's
good to see you.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.020
And you remember Seth.

31:51.060 --> 31:53.330
Sure,last time I saw you
were in a Berkeley onesie.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.000
Oh,thank you for that.

31:55.060 --> 31:57.360
Why don't you run upstairs
and put it on?

31:57.590 --> 32:00.290
- And uh,oh,here's Ryan.
- Paul Glass.

32:00.350 --> 32:01.110
Ryan,nice to meet you.

32:01.150 --> 32:02.350
Uh,Seth,why don't you
grab the bread,

32:02.380 --> 32:03.610
and then we can
all go outside.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.340
Sure.
After you.

32:08.470 --> 32:09.870
So,how's your friend?

32:09.910 --> 32:11.720
I think he's going to be okay.
At least,I hope.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.280
Well,good.What do you say
we get something to eat.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.990
What is it with people
showing up with bags?

32:20.030 --> 32:21.750
I brought you something.

32:30.810 --> 32:32.190
Providence College?

32:32.220 --> 32:33.890
It has good Catholic values.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.390
Admission standards a little
more in your wheel house,

32:36.420 --> 32:40.740
and,uh,best of all,
it's 20 minutes from Brown.

32:41.120 --> 32:41.890
Taylor...

32:41.930 --> 32:43.410
Look,Summer...

32:43.550 --> 32:45.450
who knows what's going to happen
in the future,

32:45.490 --> 32:47.300
but for right now,
Seth loves you.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.890
And you're not even
giving him a chance.

32:50.340 --> 32:51.830
Why are you doing this?

32:51.870 --> 32:55.250
I figured Brown was a little
"Vanity Fair" for my taste.

32:55.290 --> 32:57.250
And now I'm considering
the Sorbonne.

32:57.290 --> 33:01.040
No,I mean,why are you
being so nice?

33:02.870 --> 33:03.910
Well,pathetic as it sounds,

33:03.950 --> 33:06.450
you and Seth are pretty much
my best friends.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.310
And,uh,let's face it.

33:08.340 --> 33:10.680
I never really had a shot
with him.

33:10.740 --> 33:12.450
Taylor,we are your friends.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.190
Really?

33:14.250 --> 33:17.140
Um,because I just
got Kieslowski's Decalogue

33:17.210 --> 33:18.370
and,like,I don't know,

33:18.410 --> 33:19.610
I don't know if you're
in to Polish cinema,

33:19.660 --> 33:20.570
but maybe you could come over

33:20.610 --> 33:23.280
and we could have,like,
a sleepover marathon,and...

33:24.900 --> 33:27.060
No. Sorry. Okay.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.940
Keep in touch,Summer.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.870
So anyway,it was Halloween

33:35.920 --> 33:37.540
and I set Sandy up
with a roommate

33:37.560 --> 33:39.280
of this girl that I was dating.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.760
I didn't have a costume,
so when I went to pick her up,

33:41.790 --> 33:44.020
I put a bag over my head.

33:44.050 --> 33:46.200
I felt like I was dating
Elephant Man.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.560
You know,supposedly
something like 50 percent

33:48.600 --> 33:52.240
of people meet their future
mates in college.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.990
You two have girlfriends?

33:55.880 --> 33:57.240
Uh...

33:58.280 --> 33:59.460
- Um?
- Yes.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.250
i'll get that.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.460
Sure.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.770
- I don't know anymore.
- Yeah.

34:05.960 --> 34:09.340
All right,so what do you call
a black guy who flies a plane?

34:09.420 --> 34:10.139
Uh...

34:10.170 --> 34:12.420
A pilot,you frigging racist.

34:15.449 --> 34:19.840
xxx

34:19.880 --> 34:21.780
xxxx

34:21.820 --> 34:24.400
I know you probably never want
to see me again,

34:24.440 --> 34:28.120
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry again.

34:28.889 --> 34:30.040
After everything you've done,

34:30.080 --> 34:34.139
you deserve a better friend
than me.

34:37.060 --> 34:38.679
You know?

34:38.880 --> 34:40.420
Uh... I'm sorry.

34:40.469 --> 34:41.600
I have to run.

34:41.639 --> 34:43.350
It was really good to see you,
Paul.

34:43.389 --> 34:44.909
Yeah,it was great to see you,
too.

34:44.949 --> 34:45.610
Is everything okay?

34:45.659 --> 34:48.630
Oh,it's fine.
I'll be back in a half an hour.

34:51.090 --> 34:52.100
Oh,Summer.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.469
Hi,I was hoping that I could
talk to Seth.

34:54.510 --> 34:57.100
- Oh,sure,he's right up there.
- Excuse me.

35:02.780 --> 35:04.890
And then there were three.

35:05.610 --> 35:06.790
Oh,thank you!

35:06.830 --> 35:09.430
If I had to listen to one more
Berkeley anecdote...

35:13.090 --> 35:14.410
Come here.

35:16.390 --> 35:17.870
How does this go?

35:17.910 --> 35:19.580
Okay,it's not
that cold,but...

35:19.620 --> 35:23.560
No. I want to see what we are
going to look like next year.

35:23.660 --> 35:24.910
What are you talking about?

35:24.950 --> 35:26.920
I'm coming with you.

35:27.030 --> 35:28.610
Providence College.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.840
It's only 20 minutes
from Brown.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.390
- You serious?
- Yeah.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.800
I want to give us a shot,
you know.

35:34.830 --> 35:37.770
And I can't do that
from across the country. So...

35:37.790 --> 35:38.630
I don't believe this.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.960
What made you change your mind?

35:40.980 --> 35:42.350
Taylor.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.980
She made me see that at Brown

35:44.020 --> 35:46.390
you're going to be surrounded by
like,really smart people.

35:46.420 --> 35:47.760
It's going to make you feel
really stupid.

35:47.790 --> 35:51.300
So,you need someone around to
make you feel smart again.

35:51.830 --> 35:54.240
I mean,you want me to come with
you,right?

35:54.280 --> 35:56.320
Do I want you
to come with me?

35:56.380 --> 35:57.800
Summer...

35:57.890 --> 36:00.580
You're my little
snow angel.

36:09.310 --> 36:11.180
Hello,rabbit.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.090
How do you feel?

36:21.240 --> 36:24.410
Like I just got hit by a car
and shot full of drugs.

36:24.470 --> 36:26.480
Look,this is all my fault.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.380
Yeah,I guess.

36:28.530 --> 36:31.220
Kind of Ryan's too,
for reacting the way he did.

36:31.270 --> 36:36.500
And Chili,for coming up with the
whole surf contest in the first place.

36:37.020 --> 36:40.230
And the chick who hit me
didn't help things.

36:42.930 --> 36:44.740
You know what?

36:45.130 --> 36:49.220
No matter how you slice it,my
knee is still screwed up.

36:49.890 --> 36:52.290
Well,what are you going to do?

36:52.980 --> 36:55.530
I'm going to get the operation,

36:55.580 --> 36:58.590
do the rehab,
and get back on my board.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.730
Things happen,Marissa.

37:02.050 --> 37:05.100
What else you gonna do...
give up?

37:22.200 --> 37:23.690
Gus?

37:24.070 --> 37:26.100
I told your wife,
I don't swing!

37:26.150 --> 37:28.370
Oh,Kirsten,what...

37:28.760 --> 37:30.160
What... what...?

37:30.190 --> 37:31.310
Uh,hey,Julie.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.420
I was wondering if we could get
together tomorrow

37:33.460 --> 37:36.000
and discuss business ideas.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.720
Wait,you...

37:38.000 --> 37:39.910
You still want to go
into business with me?

37:39.960 --> 37:42.760
I started asking myself why you
didn't go through with this scam.

37:42.790 --> 37:46.490
You could be living in
Charlotte's beautiful condo.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.520
But you're here.

37:48.630 --> 37:50.780
Yeah,I...
I guess I could.

37:50.830 --> 37:53.340
I know you did it for me.

37:53.430 --> 37:55.380
Let me do this for you.

37:56.000 --> 37:56.820
Hey,Julie.

37:56.850 --> 37:59.290
- I've got a gun,Gus.
- That's cool.

38:04.300 --> 38:07.220
Yeah...
Let's do it.

38:09.670 --> 38:12.470
Don't... don't go there!
Don't do that again.

38:12.510 --> 38:13.850
You did that one time.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.650
Don't do that again.

38:16.290 --> 38:17.520
No more stories for me.

38:17.570 --> 38:18.590
Yeah,well,that's a good thing,

38:18.620 --> 38:20.500
'cause I think we're about
to lose Ryan.

38:20.540 --> 38:23.220
No,no,no.
It's all great. I just...

38:24.130 --> 38:28.810
I don't know if I'm ready for
the whole college thing.

38:29.170 --> 38:30.750
How's that?

38:30.780 --> 38:34.920
I look around and I've got
a home,family...

38:35.000 --> 38:38.050
Part of me feels like I
finally got it together.

38:38.470 --> 38:41.340
I'm not sure I'm ready
to leave that.

38:41.440 --> 38:44.660
You know,going away to college
is not good-bye.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.400
I know.

38:48.900 --> 38:50.540
But what happens on vacations?

38:50.580 --> 38:52.300
Do I stay in the pool house?

38:52.340 --> 38:56.920
No matter where you go,this
will always be your home.

38:59.760 --> 39:02.180
Dad,can I talk to you
inside for a second?

39:02.210 --> 39:03.510
Yeah.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.900
Excuse me a minute.

39:10.930 --> 39:13.360
So,uh,tell me...

39:13.400 --> 39:15.990
in this leaving equation,

39:16.030 --> 39:19.540
is there a serious girlfriend
component?

39:20.470 --> 39:21.900
Oh,boy.

39:23.120 --> 39:27.360
Hey,sorry for
ducking out earlier.

39:27.400 --> 39:31.370
Yeah,you missed my story about
playing Nanki-Poo in The Mikado.

39:31.420 --> 39:34.010
Oh,yeah.
That's too... too bad.

39:34.050 --> 39:35.260
Listen...

39:35.690 --> 39:38.530
I don't want you
to get upset,okay?

39:38.670 --> 39:40.230
But...

39:41.330 --> 39:43.070
I'm not going to Berkeley.

39:43.100 --> 39:44.510
I want to go to Brown.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.800
I'm not upset.
Brown's a great school.

39:46.850 --> 39:47.930
I wish you would
have told me.

39:47.970 --> 39:51.030
Dad,I been trying to for years,
and you didn't want to hear it.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.790
It's that I want you to have

39:52.830 --> 39:55.760
the same amazing experience
that I had.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.110
That is exactly why
I need to go East.

39:58.150 --> 39:59.580
It's exactly what you did.

39:59.620 --> 40:02.010
You left everything behind
and you forged your own path.

40:02.060 --> 40:03.870
I need to do that.

40:04.630 --> 40:07.940
You're already doing it.

40:08.410 --> 40:09.470
Come here.

40:14.910 --> 40:17.920
Hey,Seth's
applying to Brown.

40:17.960 --> 40:18.840
I think it's great.

40:18.890 --> 40:21.740
Listen,Summer's upstairs
ordering things from L.L. Bean,

40:21.790 --> 40:22.970
so I have to...

40:23.020 --> 40:25.080
Hurry. Hurry.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.790
So...

40:32.680 --> 40:35.480
It seems that we're going to be
empty nesters.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.090
True.

40:37.380 --> 40:41.220
What do you think about getting
an apartment in Providence?

40:41.590 --> 40:44.930
Ooh,Providence.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.530
So she's a pretty important part
of your life.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.780
Yeah,I mean,ever since
I got here,

40:49.820 --> 40:53.280
she's always accepted me
for who I am.

40:54.430 --> 40:56.970
I don't know
if I can leave that.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.060
Ryan?

41:05.260 --> 41:06.920
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.390
How's Johnny?

41:10.460 --> 41:12.010
He's okay.

41:12.930 --> 41:14.930
He's amazing,actually.

41:14.980 --> 41:17.460
You know,he says
he's going to surf again.

41:18.020 --> 41:20.180
I feel responsible.

41:20.230 --> 41:23.430
Ryan,it's not your fault.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.500
Or mine.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.250
It just happened.

41:26.470 --> 41:28.590
We can't keep blaming
ourselves for everything.

41:28.630 --> 41:30.520
And how do we do that?

41:30.570 --> 41:35.820
Well,for starters,
I'm applying to college.

41:35.990 --> 41:36.800
All right.

41:36.830 --> 41:39.590
You know,as awful
as the shooting was,

41:39.640 --> 41:43.090
if I don't let it go,
it's just going to ruin my life.

41:43.130 --> 41:44.960
Both our lives.

41:44.990 --> 41:46.270
The essay?

41:46.300 --> 41:48.970
I'll say what happened,
you know.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.180
That I saved the life
of someone I love.

41:52.220 --> 41:55.350
A college will either
accept that or not.

41:55.410 --> 41:58.090
I can't keep
hiding from it.

41:58.370 --> 42:01.230
It's made me who I am.

42:01.290 --> 42:04.040
There is no going back.

42:04.840 --> 42:07.640
You know,with everything we've
been through the past two years,

42:07.690 --> 42:09.800
and the fact that
we're still here,

42:10.140 --> 42:13.450
really makes me think there's
nothing we can't handle.

42:14.270 --> 42:15.270
Sorry to interrupt.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.560
I just wanted to say good night.

42:16.590 --> 42:17.790
It felt weird
sitting alone,

42:17.830 --> 42:19.750
and I couldn't
help overhearing.

42:19.810 --> 42:23.220
I'm hoping that you both
will apply to Berkeley.

42:23.260 --> 42:25.000
I think it'd be a good fit.

42:25.030 --> 42:27.960
If you have any questions,
just give me a call.

42:34.630 --> 42:35.420
You guys dressed?

42:35.460 --> 42:37.610
Yeah,anybody hungry?

42:38.330 --> 42:41.180
Yeah,this one's got to pack
on some pounds for the cold weather.

42:41.230 --> 42:42.910
Hmm,says Mr. Toothpick.

42:42.950 --> 42:45.350
Hey,Providence College?

42:45.380 --> 42:47.300
Wow. We're thinking
about Berkeley.

42:47.330 --> 42:49.810
So we'll be in Northern California
and you'll be in Rhode Island.

42:49.840 --> 42:52.490
Uh-oh. You and Seth are going to
have to do the long distance thing.

42:52.540 --> 42:54.290
You better not cheat
on each other.

42:54.340 --> 42:56.120
Yeah,it's college.
Things happen.

42:56.150 --> 42:58.330
Are you questioning your
sexuality?
