You know your life sucks.

D'oh!

00:34.235 --> 00:36.201
(homer groans)

00:36.203 --> 00:37.669
No parking spots?

00:37.671 --> 00:39.171
Lousy butt-kissers,

Coming in before noon,

00:40.908 --> 00:44.076
Eating donuts that are

00:44.912 --> 00:46.078
Oh, oh, oh!

Stupid smart car.

it's empty!

01:08.069 --> 01:09.535
Homer, no!

01:09.537 --> 01:10.936
That's burns' spot.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.404
How could you miss
that sign?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.606
Oof. The last guy
that parked there is now a...

01:14.608 --> 01:15.808
(quietly):
Speed bump.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.510
(muffled):
Slow down!

01:18.512 --> 01:20.245
Guys, be cool.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.114
Burns'll never know.

01:22.116 --> 01:25.417
He's on vacation this week with
his weirdo hunting buddies.

Release the sedated quail.

01:41.035 --> 01:43.035
(gun clicks)

01:43.037 --> 01:45.304
How am i supposed to hunt it
if it can move?

01:48.809 --> 01:51.944
Try it now, davy crockett!

01:52.947 --> 01:56.048
Damn you, surface tension...

01:56.050 --> 01:58.150
Wait a minute.

Congratulations.

Ow!

03:55.436 --> 03:58.604
I'm drowning in cement!

03:58.606 --> 04:01.206
Uh, it's actually
concrete.
Woo hoo!

04:01.208 --> 04:03.208
Of which cement
is an ingredient.

04:03.210 --> 04:06.011
(yells):
No!

04:06.013 --> 04:08.580
(rhythmic yelling)

04:08.582 --> 04:10.182
(moans)

04:10.184 --> 04:11.950
(marge humming)
hmm?

04:11.952 --> 04:14.720
Marge:
Perfect.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.388
(chuckles)
marge,

04:16.390 --> 04:18.223
You've thought
of everything.

04:18.225 --> 04:20.525
Except for one
nagging detail.

04:20.527 --> 04:23.462
Did i ever tell you about the
time<i> i</i> was in a big cast?

04:23.464 --> 04:26.932
It was the shelbyville players
production of<i> pippin.</i>

04:26.934 --> 04:28.900
Don't worry, homie.
Grampa: I went from player

04:28.902 --> 04:31.403
To ticket taker
in one performance!

04:31.405 --> 04:33.238
There's two ways of...

04:33.240 --> 04:35.307
(seagulls chirping
and tide rolling)

04:44.985 --> 04:47.052
You are in my seat.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.720
Fight! Fight! Fight!

04:48.722 --> 04:51.089
Asthma, glasses, asthma!

04:51.091 --> 04:52.724
(grunts)

04:52.726 --> 04:55.627
(cheering, yelling)

04:55.629 --> 04:57.829
Oh. There's too much violence

04:57.831 --> 04:59.731
In rearview mirrors these days.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.137
Homer:
<i>Hey, boy,</i>

05:05.139 --> 05:06.505
Want to sign
your old man's cast?

05:06.507 --> 05:09.408
<i>No problemo.</i>

05:09.410 --> 05:10.409
(marker squeaking)

05:10.411 --> 05:11.810
What does it say?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.145
Don't worry about it.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.279
What did you write?

05:14.281 --> 05:15.914
Sorry. That's between me

05:15.916 --> 05:17.149
And everyone who sees it.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.950
Homer:
I need to know!
Hmm.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.820
Begins with f and ends in c-k.

05:21.822 --> 05:22.988
Why you little!

05:22.990 --> 05:25.123
(grunting, groaning)

05:25.125 --> 05:26.425
(chuckles)

05:28.829 --> 05:29.828
Homer:
Tell me!

05:29.830 --> 05:31.163
Never!

05:31.165 --> 05:32.531
(grunting)

05:32.533 --> 05:33.932
(moans)

05:33.934 --> 05:36.001
(quickly):
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

05:36.003 --> 05:37.135
Woo hoo!
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

05:37.137 --> 05:38.136
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

05:38.138 --> 05:39.371
Woo hoo! D'oh! D'oh!

05:39.373 --> 05:41.373
(slowing down):
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

05:41.375 --> 05:42.507
D'oh...

05:42.509 --> 05:43.842
Woo hoo!

05:46.213 --> 05:47.713
Marge:
<i>Thanks, partner.</i>

05:47.715 --> 05:50.549
We've balled up
all the 13 gauge alpaca.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.018
Now maybe there's
something fun we can do?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.153
Sure is. A puzzle.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.521
"foggy day in berlin."

05:56.523 --> 05:58.724
5,000 pieces.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.058
Hmm...

06:01.795 --> 06:04.029
(german accent):
Homer, complete the puzzle!

06:04.031 --> 06:05.063
I'm a married man!

06:05.065 --> 06:06.565
Fine. If you need me,

06:06.567 --> 06:08.533
I'll be in your<i> schpankenbank.</i>

06:08.535 --> 06:12.404
Female singer:
♪ we'll meet again ♪

06:12.406 --> 06:15.540
Marge, i don't think
we should do this puzzle.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.343
I know. You can't
pick up the pieces.

06:18.345 --> 06:21.847
That's why i've devised
a grid system.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.750
Huh? I'll hold up a piece,
and you call out the number

06:24.752 --> 06:27.552
And letter of
the corresponding grid square.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.987
Uh... I don't know.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.088
Q 15?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.824
Sweetie, it's a side piece.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.426
Q 15's in the middle.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.061
Right. Q 15 is in the middle.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.263
Nothing more fun than rules.

06:38.265 --> 06:41.099
I'll make some tea
to help you think.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.835
Oh, i hate being
immobile and numb.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.937
If only i was free to move.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.708
(moans)

06:49.710 --> 06:51.109
If only.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.111
(excited chatter)

06:53.113 --> 06:55.947
It's never pleasant to see
this kind of activity, lisa.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.717
Particularly on a cell phone
that is so much nicer

06:58.719 --> 07:00.185
Than the one i own.

07:03.257 --> 07:07.058
All the fighting seems to start
with who sits where on the bus.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.961
Um, lisa. You seem to have a
handle on the bus problem.

07:09.963 --> 07:13.031
Why don't you tackle it?
But don't think i won't help.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.633
I'm providing you with a sash.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.067
Skinner!

07:16.069 --> 07:18.270
You are asking
a six-year-old girl

07:18.272 --> 07:20.372
To fix this school's problems.

07:20.374 --> 07:21.773
I'm eight.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.008
Oh, carry on.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.077
What do you mean,
there's a legal issue

07:26.079 --> 07:27.446
With my trapdoor?

07:27.448 --> 07:29.147
And, uh, as you explain,

07:29.149 --> 07:31.383
Please take two steps back.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.552
The old trapdoor
was perfectly legal.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.054
It was grandfathered in
under the reagan-era code.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.056
But once you start
renovating it,

07:38.058 --> 07:40.926
It has to brought up
to modern standards.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.762
Mm. And it has to be
handicap accessible.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.831
A wheelchair would never fall
through the current opening.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.299
(chuckling): Oh!
But that's not a problem!

07:47.301 --> 07:49.100
I refuse to hire
the handicapped.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.335
That's another issue.

07:50.337 --> 07:53.138
But for now, we have
left ourselves open

07:53.140 --> 07:55.640
To a lawsuit by homer simpson.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.310
Fine. Smithers, go see
this simpson character

07:58.312 --> 08:00.679
And trick him into signing
a waiver of liability.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.981
I'll discuss things
with the foreman.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.419
(yelling):
<i>Enrique, mas grande la puerta!</i>

08:07.421 --> 08:08.820
(homer moans)

08:08.822 --> 08:11.690
Look, homie! We got
three pieces together.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.124
That's a good day's work!

08:13.126 --> 08:15.160
Why don't we do
one of maggie's puzzles?

08:15.162 --> 08:18.663
Cow goes in the cow-shaped hole,
boom. Next case.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.533
Hmm, i thought the one good
thing about you hurting yourself

08:21.535 --> 08:23.935
Was that we could spend
more time together.

08:23.937 --> 08:24.936
You did?

08:24.938 --> 08:25.937
Didn't you?

08:25.939 --> 08:28.540
Oh yeah, sure, of course.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.543
Only a fool
would admit otherwise.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.644
Mm....

08:32.646 --> 08:33.712
(doorbell rings)

08:34.648 --> 08:35.947
(sighs)

08:35.949 --> 08:37.349
(sighs)

08:37.351 --> 08:40.986
Mr. Smithers! Come in, come in.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.988
(chuckling): Oh! Well,
there's our tangle-foot!

08:42.990 --> 08:44.456
Already on the mend.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.824
Yeah, right.

08:45.826 --> 08:46.958
They say it'll be three months

08:46.960 --> 08:48.960
Before i can scratch my ass.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.996
Six before i can
really go at it.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.064
Listen, i-i don't want
to take up your time.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.133
I just need homer's signature
on a couple of things.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.003
First, a get well
card to himself.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.971
And what else does
he need to sign?

08:59.973 --> 09:01.072
Oh, a... (coughing)

09:01.074 --> 09:02.407
...Waiver of liability.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.210
I know, i know.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.045
There are solid reasons to sue.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.047
But do you really want
to fill your life

09:09.049 --> 09:12.350
With parasitic attorneys
with get-rich-quick schemes?

09:12.352 --> 09:14.219
Schemes? Rich? Quick?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.321
Parasitic? Woo hoo!

09:16.323 --> 09:19.057
How could i have forgotten
to sue mr. Burns?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.892
That's how you get rich
in america.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.094
Sue s. A! Sue s. A!

09:23.096 --> 09:25.163
Oh, lord.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.666
Finally, a chance to use this.

09:27.668 --> 09:31.903
It was designed ironically,
but i would die for it.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.044
Are you home during the day
because you were injured

09:39.046 --> 09:41.913
At work, school, museum, church,
iraq, elevator plummet,

09:41.915 --> 09:44.516
Uneven sidewalk, hit by foul
ball, hit by fair ball,

09:44.518 --> 09:46.618
Or iditarod viewing party?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.219
The first one!
The first one you said!

09:48.221 --> 09:50.021
Call me, maxwell flinch,

09:50.023 --> 09:53.725
At 555-555-5555.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.427
Five, five, five...

09:55.429 --> 09:57.596
Wait, what was the number
after the first three fives,

09:57.598 --> 09:59.297
But before the last six fives?

09:59.299 --> 10:01.066
Uh, simpson, before
you do anything rash,

10:01.068 --> 10:03.902
Mr. Burns wanted you
to enjoy this get-well cake.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.037
What's that writing on top?
Oh!

10:06.039 --> 10:08.473
It's just, uh,
strawberry boilerplate

10:08.475 --> 10:10.075
Absolving us of liability.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.043
Now just bite here, here, here,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.079
Nibble here, lick here...

10:14.081 --> 10:16.414
Uh, your wife needs
to eat this cupcake...

10:16.416 --> 10:19.084
Sir, you cannot
bribe me with cake.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.554
Because i just ate several pies.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.589
Hello, mr. Smithers.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.091
I see you haven't given up.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.726
(sighing)

10:27.728 --> 10:30.095
Just enjoy the cake.
As long as you don't eat it

10:30.097 --> 10:32.097
In front of a notary
public, you're fine.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.632
I'm a notary public.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.334
You gave your ink pad to maggie.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.439
(moans)
i'll, um, i'll walk out
with you.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.174
Don't go yet.
You guys can help me

10:43.176 --> 10:45.510
Brainstorm a pattern
for my new quilt.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.946
Marge, i mean this
in the nicest way:

10:47.948 --> 10:51.082
Your idea of fun makes me
want to blow my brains out.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.317
(murmurs disappointedly)

10:53.687 --> 10:56.621
Oh, razzmatazz is
perfect, marge.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.189
It's-it's uh--
it's red,

10:58.191 --> 11:00.258
But not,
uh, too red.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.426
You're right!

11:01.428 --> 11:02.961
Why don't you stick around

11:02.963 --> 11:05.030
And we'll discuss
stitching patterns over tea?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.264
I'd like that.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.999
And i'll take the cake
back to the home

11:08.001 --> 11:09.801
And share it
with the seniors.

11:09.803 --> 11:10.802
Typical.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.103
I'll keep dad company.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.271
Thank you, bart.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.041
Grampa (moaning):
Oh, i dropped it.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.777
Hey, wha-what did you
put down my back?

11:18.779 --> 11:19.978
Could be a tarantula,

11:19.980 --> 11:20.979
Could just be some yarn.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.180
I'll be at milhouse's.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.049
(whining fearfully)

11:26.286 --> 11:28.353
(sighing)

11:30.157 --> 11:32.290
What the hell?

11:32.292 --> 11:35.126
Oh, it's such a pleasure
to pour tea for someone

11:35.128 --> 11:37.128
And not have to
help him chew it.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.697
We've made our choices.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.799
And the world doesn't
understand them,

11:40.801 --> 11:42.200
But we do.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.804
Oh!
Ew...

11:45.806 --> 11:47.772
Oh...
Aw...

11:49.076 --> 11:50.875
You know marge,
somehow i feel that

11:50.877 --> 11:52.343
More than anyone,
you understand

11:52.345 --> 11:55.080
Those horrible words,
"what do you see in him?"

11:55.082 --> 11:56.514
I never said this,

11:56.516 --> 11:59.517
But did you ever think
we cling to these guys

11:59.519 --> 12:02.554
Because we're afraid
to admit we were wrong?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.355
Do you really think that?

12:04.357 --> 12:07.225
Well, i've tried to
use it constructively.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.729
I try to have
"the serenity

12:10.731 --> 12:12.497
"to accept the things
i cannot change

12:12.499 --> 12:14.699
And the courage to change
the things i can."

12:14.701 --> 12:16.000
Homer:
That's what they said to me

12:16.002 --> 12:18.203
At that alcoholics unanimous
meeting!

12:18.205 --> 12:19.604
(groans)

12:19.606 --> 12:21.039
Lisa:
<i>Attention, bus riders!</i>

12:21.041 --> 12:23.441
My new seating plan
avoids conflict

12:23.443 --> 12:26.277
Through the use of
complex social algorithms.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.847
It teams up
compatible seatmates

12:28.849 --> 12:30.915
And places milhouse with no one.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.052
Yet somehow,
i'm still a little scared.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.020
Otto, why are you
sitting in back?

12:36.022 --> 12:38.022
Waiting for my assignment,
chief.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.024
The driver's seat.
You're the driver.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.359
Still me?

12:41.361 --> 12:44.095
(scoffs)
new management, same mistakes.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.601
It's so quiet. I've never been
able to hear my music before.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.870
(rock music plays
over headphones)

12:51.872 --> 12:53.671
Ooh, it sucks.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.641
Lisa:
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

12:56.643 --> 12:58.042
<i>Soon i'll have control over</i>

12:58.044 --> 12:59.978
<i>Every aspect of their lives.</i>

12:59.980 --> 13:04.449
<i>And then i'll make them achieve</i>
<i>their un-dreamt dreams.</i>

13:04.451 --> 13:06.818
Sherri next to terri.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.219
Jimbo next to dolph.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.921
No one next to milhouse.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.656
Ralph next to
his invisible friend.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.057
Kearney next to nelson.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.993
Martin next to wendell.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.961
Cosine next to database.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.265
(gasps)

13:20.267 --> 13:22.600
My first pg-13 fantasy.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.636
Since we haven't been able
to get a settlement,

13:24.638 --> 13:26.938
We'll have to start preparing
you for your deposition.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.941
Caroline here will stand in
for the opposing attorney.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.643
Good afternoon,
mr. Burns.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.112
Release the hounds.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.248
Uh, sir, you should try to
project a friendlier demeanor.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.250
Release the hounds.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.652
Please.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.654
Seriously, sir, it
would really be wise

13:42.656 --> 13:44.122
Not to mention
the hounds.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.157
Oh, that's like telling
three-finger brown

13:46.159 --> 13:48.026
He can't play
for the brooklyn tip-tops.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.160
(groans)

13:49.162 --> 13:50.595
Marge:
<i>Waylon,</i>

13:50.597 --> 13:51.629
Now i can see why

13:51.631 --> 13:54.666
So many women in movies
have gay friends.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.669
Like princess leia
and c-3po.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.104
Listen, i made this for you.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.506
(gasps)
oh, my god.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.108
No one ever gives<i> me</i> a gift.
Thank you.

14:04.110 --> 14:07.045
No one ever tells me thank you.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.214
I think you see my true self.

14:09.216 --> 14:12.717
The one i never
pay attention to at all.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.019
<i>Oh, my god.</i>
<i>I want to kiss him.</i>

14:15.021 --> 14:17.121
Smithers:<i> Oh, my god.</i>
<i>She wants to kiss me.</i>

14:17.123 --> 14:18.189
Marge:<i> I'm a married woman.</i>
Smithers:<i> She would</i>

14:18.191 --> 14:20.024
<i>Look good with a mustache.</i>

14:20.026 --> 14:22.093
(phone vibrates)

14:28.969 --> 14:30.235
Uh, i've got to go.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.173
Thank god i've got
a husband with benefits.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.575
Come here, you.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.077
Okay, but... (exclaims)

14:50.190 --> 14:52.991
Mmm... Smithers.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.159
Homer:
<i>Wait a sec.</i>

14:55.161 --> 14:58.763
<i>Marge is getting her emotional</i>
<i>needs fulfilled by another man,</i>

14:58.765 --> 15:01.666
<i>And now she needs me</i>
<i>for nothing but sex.</i>

15:01.668 --> 15:03.801
<i>I'm the luckiest husband</i>
<i>in the world!</i>

15:09.175 --> 15:12.176
You haven't gotten that
stupid signature yet?

15:12.178 --> 15:13.344
No.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.879
And i'm not sure i want to.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.547
You defy me?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.783
Smithers, pour me
a glass of water.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.855
Now squeeze my chest.

15:23.857 --> 15:25.456
(coughs)

15:25.458 --> 15:27.926
Now, either get that signature
or you're in charge

15:27.928 --> 15:30.261
Of restarting our plant
at chernobyl.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.596
That was us?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.064
That doesn't
leave this room.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.935
Well brother,
prepare to enjoy another day

15:36.937 --> 15:40.071
Of calm, peaceful behavior
on the school bus.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.273
I got to warn you,
a lot of kids

15:42.275 --> 15:44.275
Are pretty unhappy with
the required seating.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.810
(chuckles)

15:45.812 --> 15:48.112
Well, they'll be happy
when i also organize

15:48.114 --> 15:50.748
Cafeteria seating,
who's picked for teams,

15:50.750 --> 15:53.751
And i've divided the playground
into swingers and pushers.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.086
That's insane.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.555
You just bought yourself
a year of pushing.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.674
That was a pub at the airport.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.377
I had an ale. You sat on a
barrel. That makes it colonial.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.579
Homer, i'm sorry, you
have to understand.

18:01.581 --> 18:05.450

Oh, my wife really needs
something and to get it

18:14.461 --> 18:16.761
I may have to forego
my settlement.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.363
Homer, you fell down a
trapdoor into a cement mixer.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.232
Don't you think i deserve
something for that?

18:21.234 --> 18:23.634

Change the venue, sir.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.742
You can't win a case
in this town.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.545
Oh, are they still mad about me
eating the town panda?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.047
Get over it.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

You have to keep
mr. Smithers here.

Why doesn't anyone
ever think of the lawyer?

18:58.738 --> 19:01.472
Aw, if i do a slip 'n' fall
on the courthouse steps,

19:01.474 --> 19:03.107
Would that help?

19:03.109 --> 19:04.742
(sniffs)
it might.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.081
See you thursday.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.316
And i'll see<i> you</i> thursday night.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.018
Oh. (chuckles)

19:14.020 --> 19:17.355
And i'll see<i> you</i>
early friday morning.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.123
Mm-hmm.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.358
Mm-hmm.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.860
Oh, these slippery stairs.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.328
(exclaiming)

19:24.330 --> 19:25.930
(gasps)
homie!

19:25.932 --> 19:27.031
Marge, no!

19:30.770 --> 19:32.203
(honks)

19:33.306 --> 19:34.705
<i>Marge,</i>

19:34.707 --> 19:37.441
I know smithers
was good at talking to you.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.143
And i want to talk to you too.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.711
Oh.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.281
Just don't expect me
to be great at first.

19:46.152 --> 19:49.187
Oh, honey, no one's great
their first time.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.988
It's like baking.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.624
Uh, okay, well, uh...

19:53.626 --> 19:54.959
I like you.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.161
And i adore you.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.964
You sacrificed yourself
for my happiness.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.999
There is nothing
that makes a woman

20:02.001 --> 20:04.202
Feel more cherished
and secure.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.003
Thank you, my darling.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.140
(whispers):
Marge, this is going great.

20:09.142 --> 20:12.009
Grampa:
Now don't you worry,
i made you both soup.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.912
Ooh-hoo, it's pipin' hot.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.380
Two hours in the microwave.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.982
(exclaims)

20:26.025 --> 20:30.161
Who knows what the "d.C." stands
for in washington, d.C.? Anyone?

20:30.163 --> 20:31.028
Anyone?

20:31.030 --> 20:32.196
Mustn't be a know-it-all.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.165
Never again. Not worth it.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.100
D.C. Anyone?

20:36.102 --> 20:39.036
Daddy's kitchen?
(grumbles)

20:39.038 --> 20:40.404
Not quite.
Anyone else?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.006
No? Okay.

20:42.008 --> 20:45.876
Children, "d.C." stands for
"district of the capitol."

20:45.878 --> 20:47.411
No it doesn't!

20:47.413 --> 20:49.280
The answer is
"district of columbia."

20:49.282 --> 20:51.616
And miss hoover, i don't
want to be a smarty pants,

20:51.618 --> 20:54.118
But the previous answer
was texas.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.920
Before that, 1848.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.755
Before that, seward's folly.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.724
And your dentist appointment
is not tomorrow,

20:59.726 --> 21:02.326
It's the day after.
Thank you.
