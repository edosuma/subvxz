New coat, new capos.
You're walking tall these days.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.805
Hope those nuns in jail don't crack,

13:25.888 --> 13:28.057
and talk about
how you were their candy man.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.520
I'll settle for ten percent.
But I need to see your books.

13:33.562 --> 13:34.688
Naturally.

[Jughead] <i>All right, Serpents.</i>

14:01.382 --> 14:04.802
It's come to my attention
one of us has been dealing Fizzle Rocks.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.388
Slinging dope is not what Serpents do.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.682
So, from this moment on,
we're going clean.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.935
There will be no selling or doing drugs.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.980
No crime of any kind will be tolerated.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.608
Anyone that breaks the Serpent Code
will be exiled.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.612
-Permanently.
-I think it's pretty ridic

14:23.696 --> 14:27.283
that you vanish for a month
on some vision quest with your bestie,

14:27.366 --> 14:31.370
only to return
and lecture us about responsibility.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.581
We got no money coming in, Jug.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.000
How are we supposed to eat?

14:36.083 --> 14:37.001
Survive?

14:39.628 --> 14:42.548
We'll figure it out and get back to you,
Fangs. All of you.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.716
In the meantime...

14:44.508 --> 14:46.886
"In unity there is strength."

14:47.469 --> 14:49.221
[all] In unity, there is strength.

[screaming]

15:03.944 --> 15:04.778
Help me!

15:04.862 --> 15:08.616
I'm so, so sorry this happened to you,
Josie.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.620
I'm paying someone a lot to make sure
this exact sort of thing doesn't happen.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.247
They were from your father's gang,
weren't they?

15:18.292 --> 15:20.669
You know,
whatever problems you've got with him,

15:20.753 --> 15:22.546
I can't be dragged into them.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.257
Either you get this mess straightened out,

15:25.341 --> 15:27.760
or La Bonne Nuit finds itself
a new headliner.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.513
[Polly] <i>They helped me. Gave me freedom.</i>

15:31.597 --> 15:32.848
<i>Gave me back my life.</i>

15:32.932 --> 15:35.517
At the Farm,
you won't be the only ones doing chores.

15:35.935 --> 15:36.852
Everybody's equal.

15:38.896 --> 15:39.772
Um...

15:40.272 --> 15:41.315
Polly. Evelyn.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.734
What the hell is going on?

15:44.485 --> 15:47.154
Mom called.
She said that you had your hands full.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.072
Want a T-shirt?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.533
Um, no. And neither do they.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.954
Guys, don't take anything
from these two vampires, okay?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.998
-They're bribing you.
-Betty doesn't know what she's saying.

15:58.082 --> 16:02.920
When I escaped the Sisters,
the Farm became my salvation, my family.

16:03.003 --> 16:06.382
Okay, as your Gryphon Queen,
I promised to protect you,

16:06.507 --> 16:07.549
and keep you safe.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.095
-And trust me, the Farm is not safe.
-Not safe?

16:11.178 --> 16:14.390
Did you tell them how the Gargoyle King
and his henchmen broke into this house

16:14.473 --> 16:15.849
and terrorized you and Mom?

16:16.892 --> 16:19.395
What about these drugs we found here?

16:19.937 --> 16:22.314
How can you be protecting them
if you allow them

16:22.398 --> 16:24.274
to put dangerous chemicals
in their bodies?

16:24.775 --> 16:27.152
I didn't know.
I don't know how they get them.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.697
They're too scared to tell you,
because you're a Serpent.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.198
But they told us.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.450
A Serpent dealer named Fangs Fogarty.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.164
[Jughead] <i>If you were hard up,</i>
<i>you could've talked to me.</i>

16:39.248 --> 16:42.042
The quarantine happened.
I needed money. You were gone.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.586
Then you talk to me.
What do you need money for?

16:46.755 --> 16:47.798
[sniffles]

16:51.510 --> 16:52.344
My mom's sick.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.557
She's got treatments
that we can't pay for.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.685
You're like a brother to me.
We could've helped.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.563
-I was ashamed.
-So, you started dealing Fizzle Rocks?

17:03.063 --> 17:04.982
Where'd you get it? The Gargoyle Gang?

17:09.945 --> 17:10.946
I'm out now.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.073
Punishment for breaking the Code is exile.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.790
However,
you've had a rougher year than most.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.750
[sighs]

17:23.834 --> 17:27.463
I'm willing to look the other way,
but this has to stay between us, okay?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.882
-If I catch you dealing--
-You won't.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.010
I'm done.
[Toni] Is that...?

18:09.546 --> 18:13.550
A Glamergé Egg worth more than the GNP
of most developing countries?

18:13.634 --> 18:15.302
Why, yes, Kitty Cat, it is.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.014
[Toni] Okay, let's go.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.645
Wait, Tee-Tee.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.570
I'm feeling particularly brazen tonight.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.383
[Archie] Cassidy?

18:57.845 --> 18:59.596
Good. You're awake.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.181
Time to play.

19:05.686 --> 19:09.064
-This isn't real. You guys are all dead.
-You keep saying that.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.942
But then how are we here,
talking with you?

19:12.025 --> 19:14.278
I'm dreaming. I must be.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.655
Or I'm hallucinating
from the loss of blood.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.992
Or we're here, and this is real.

19:20.075 --> 19:20.909
No.

19:21.869 --> 19:26.248
I went to juvie... after being framed
for your murder, Cassidy.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.877
I found you three in the mines
after Sheriff Minetta gunned you down.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.255
If what you say is true, and we are dead,

19:33.338 --> 19:35.132
it sounds like it's all your fault.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.551
If you ever wanna return to Eldervair,

19:37.634 --> 19:38.969
you're gonna have to play.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.179
And win.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.682
Come on.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.684
One round, at least?

19:53.150 --> 19:54.151
One round.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.362
Any luck, Ms. Weiss?

19:58.697 --> 20:01.366
I'm on the phone
with Child Services nonstop, Betty.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.284
But...

20:04.912 --> 20:08.624
But it's gonna be hard getting the kids
you're housing adopted or fostered.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.169
There's concern about the trauma
they've suffered.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.922
Yeah, well,
the Sisters really did a number on them.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.468
Any luck getting the Sisters
to testify against Hiram?

20:21.303 --> 20:23.096
They've taken a vow of silence.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.016
It's part of their religion.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.059
Religion?

20:27.351 --> 20:28.185
Mm-hm.
Betty.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.859
As a social worker, I've had dealings
with the Sisters over the years.

20:36.276 --> 20:39.988
And there's something you need to know
about their affiliation with the Church.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.658
[Veronica] <i>Josie was stalked, Daddy.</i>

20:42.741 --> 20:44.243
By those Gargoyles of yours.

20:44.326 --> 20:47.496
So, tell me, if I'm paying you ten percent
for protection,

20:47.579 --> 20:49.248
why is my headliner harassed?

20:49.331 --> 20:52.251
Because you had the audacity
to try to deceive me.

20:52.334 --> 20:55.379
Cooking the books?
That's the move of a rank amateur.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.923
Now I want the full amount I'm owed.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.550
And your mother's Glamergé Egg
that was stolen.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.804
-Come again?
-One of your Serpent school chums

21:03.887 --> 21:06.640
broke into our apartment
and stole your mother's bauble.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.850
And based on the calling card they left...
I'm guessing it's probably Cheryl Blossom.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.691
Anyway, get it back for me, won't you?

21:15.774 --> 21:17.276
Why is this my responsibility?

21:17.359 --> 21:19.278
Because you have more to lose than me.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.864
[Veronica] <i>You need to fix this, Jughead.</i>

21:22.948 --> 21:25.826
If Cheryl took the Egg, why come to me?
Why not go to her?

21:26.326 --> 21:27.786
She's dodging my phone calls.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.080
Besides, aren't you her king?

21:30.998 --> 21:33.417
-Why are you and your father aligned?
-We're not.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.461
He's squeezing me.
He's squeezing my business.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.631
Now, not only does he
have me paying him protection,

21:40.257 --> 21:43.760
he's got me on this wild-goose chase
to get my mom's stolen Egg back.

21:43.844 --> 21:47.556
-You pay your father protection money?
-Against his very own Gargoyle Gang.

21:50.058 --> 21:52.936
What if you pay less money
not to be in business with him?

21:53.020 --> 21:55.772
-What are you suggesting?
-Let the Serpents work for you.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.108
Get real protection
from your father's goons.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.527
And the Serpents get jobs,
with a steady income.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.528
This is a win-win.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.241
Get me that Glamergé Egg back,
and we have an accord.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.496
Your turn, Red.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.546
"Defeat the Hooded Specter of Death."

22:22.090 --> 22:22.924
Go on.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.805
The challenge reveals the weakness.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.224
The weakness is
what keeps you from winning.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.033
[man] Give me your wallet!

23:02.255 --> 23:03.173
[gunshot]

23:09.721 --> 23:11.139
[Archie] I did it.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.517
Now am I finished playing this game?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.561
[Norton] The Red Paladin returns.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.814
[Archie] Warden Norton?

23:18.897 --> 23:20.899
Take a load off, my boy.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.901
We're just getting started.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.783
I won't play the game
with someone who died from it.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.201
I didn't die.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.495
I ascended to the kingdom.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.914
And what about Joaquin?
Did he ascend, too?

23:35.997 --> 23:38.708
That was his reward for stabbing me,
wasn't it?

23:38.792 --> 23:40.961
That was the card Mr. DeSantos drew.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.004
His do-or-die moment.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.258
You know all about those,
don't you, Archie?

23:46.341 --> 23:48.093
Didn't you have one yourself?

23:48.176 --> 23:49.177
With the Black Hood?

23:49.636 --> 23:50.470
Yes.

23:52.264 --> 23:56.518
And I stopped him,
but I'm still trapped here, in this hell.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.019
Then that wasn't the moment.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.481
The place and time
where it all went wrong.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.066
Roll the dice,

24:03.525 --> 24:06.987
and you may find the path
that leads back to Eldervair.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.325
We know your secret, Sister Woodhouse.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.203
The Church disbanded
the Sisters of Quiet Mercy

24:15.287 --> 24:16.329
during Vatican II,

24:16.413 --> 24:20.542
over allegations
of cruel and inhumane practices.

24:20.625 --> 24:25.380
You and your sisters haven't been nuns
for more than 60 years.

24:25.797 --> 24:29.134
Which means your vow of silence
won't hold up in court.

24:29.217 --> 24:30.552
Here's the new deal.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.345
Testify against Hiram Lodge,

24:32.429 --> 24:35.265
and I won't have you charged
with the following crimes:

24:35.348 --> 24:39.269
Child endangerment,
illegal drug testing, human trafficking.

24:43.982 --> 24:44.858
[sighs]

24:45.358 --> 24:46.193
Fine.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.696
What do I need to do?

24:49.779 --> 24:53.241
Swear in court
that Hiram Lodge gave you money and drugs

24:53.325 --> 24:54.493
for illegal testing.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.119
You'll have immunity.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.332
[Jughead] <i>Serpents.</i>

25:00.415 --> 25:01.500
Earlier today...

25:02.667 --> 25:03.919
I brokered a deal.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.464
Got us a paid gig.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.842
From here on out,
we'll be working security detail

25:10.926 --> 25:14.012
for Veronica Lodge,
her speakeasy, and her employees.

25:14.095 --> 25:16.556
-Long live the Serpents. Whoo!
-[all cheering]

25:17.557 --> 25:18.517
Settle down.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.270
It's good news,
but I've also gathered us here

25:22.354 --> 25:23.813
for less celebratory reasons.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.817
Cheryl, Toni.

25:29.402 --> 25:30.904
-Come up here.
-Excuse me?

25:32.113 --> 25:33.114
What did we do?

25:33.198 --> 25:36.952
You broke into the Lodge apartment
and stole a Glamergé Egg.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.956
So what if we did?

25:41.289 --> 25:43.792
Well, more than that,
you left your calling card...

25:44.543 --> 25:46.878
attaching yourself, and, by extension,

25:46.962 --> 25:48.713
all of the Serpents to your crime.

25:48.797 --> 25:49.965
I'm not afraid of Lodge.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.299
What's he gonna do?

25:51.383 --> 25:52.384
Call the sheriff?

25:52.926 --> 25:55.637
-Oh, right, there is no sheriff.
-That's not the point.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.721
You broke the Code.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.101
-Turn in your jackets and go.
-[Toni] Are you serious?

26:01.184 --> 26:04.729
I'm a Serpent by blood.
You can't take that away from me.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.606
[Cheryl] You hypocrite.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.984
Give your buddy Fangs a pass,
but crucify us?

26:09.442 --> 26:13.029
In case you're wondering how we know,
Fangs told Sweet Pea, who told me.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.030
Who told me.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.618
If you ask for our jackets,
shouldn't you ask for his?

26:24.416 --> 26:25.250
Jug.

26:29.379 --> 26:30.589
You're right.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.175
-Fangs, give me your jacket.
-Hey. What the hell, man?

26:34.551 --> 26:35.760
It's okay, Sweet Pea.

26:55.196 --> 26:56.531
Some leader you are.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.074
Fangs.

27:02.621 --> 27:03.788
[Jughead] Cheryl? Toni?

27:05.165 --> 27:06.708
We'll go, but we're keeping our jackets.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.377
Fine. But I need that Egg back.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.171
Come again?

27:11.254 --> 27:12.964
You need to give me that damn Egg.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.258
Or Veronica won't give us the contract.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.177
Why would I care? I'm not a Serpent.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.846
Because I believe
that you still have honor, Cheryl.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.223
And it's getting cold out,

27:22.307 --> 27:25.060
and the rest of us don't
get to go back to Thistlehouse.

27:28.938 --> 27:30.565
[Veronica] Well done, <i>Torombolo.</i>

27:30.815 --> 27:34.110
Cost me a lot to get that ugly thing back.
You put it to good use.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.154
Oh, don't you worry, I shall.

27:36.571 --> 27:37.572
And in the meantime,

27:37.656 --> 27:39.824
you and the Serpents have
your first assignment.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.036
You ever hear of the Gargoyle Gang?

27:45.163 --> 27:47.290
[Betty]
<i>Tyler, what the hell happened to you?</i>

27:47.374 --> 27:48.583
You lied to us.

27:49.751 --> 27:53.254
-What do you mean? I would never.
-You said he was dead, but I saw him.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.132
I saw the Gargoyle King.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.301
[all gasping and chattering]

28:00.178 --> 28:01.262
What? Where?

28:01.346 --> 28:02.389
Fox Forest.

28:02.472 --> 28:07.060
He was there, with other Gargoyles,
his gang. They beat me up.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.812
The Gryphon Queen is a liar.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.439
And if she lied
about the Gargoyle King being dead,

28:11.523 --> 28:15.235
-maybe she lied when she says we're safe.
-I'm not. You have to believe me.

28:15.318 --> 28:18.571
The Sisters are going
to testify against the Man in Black,

28:18.655 --> 28:20.198
and then you will all be safe.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.366
Where, Betty?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.243
Where will we be safe?

28:31.126 --> 28:33.712
It's your turn, Red Paladin.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.380
Go on.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.007
Pick your Quest Card.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.518
What does it say?

28:50.687 --> 28:51.980
"Kill the Gargoyle King."

28:52.063 --> 28:53.189
Are you sure?

28:54.107 --> 28:55.150
Read it again.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.197
"Kill the Man in Black."

29:02.407 --> 29:04.200
You have your marching orders.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.203
Slay the dragon.

29:10.749 --> 29:11.791
Good luck.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.912
The Gargoyle King.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.623
The Man in Black.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.377
How many names do you have, Hiram?

29:58.087 --> 29:59.255
I know why you've come.

30:01.883 --> 30:05.261
Do you genuinely think
killing me will solve all your problems?

30:05.345 --> 30:06.888
It's what I should've done that night.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.558
In here, my do-or-die moment,
before you had me arrested.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.645
Yeah, it was awfully stupid of you
to come in here,

30:14.229 --> 30:15.230
threaten me,

30:15.814 --> 30:17.440
tell me all your plans.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.150
What was I supposed to do?

30:19.692 --> 30:20.819
Not have you arrested?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.118
Put that down, Archie. You're not gonna--

30:29.202 --> 30:30.537
[Hiram grunting]

30:42.966 --> 30:45.134
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

30:45.218 --> 30:46.970
I thought... I thought it was over.

30:47.053 --> 30:48.221
You're almost done.

30:49.597 --> 30:51.057
Just one last round to play.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.857
[Betty] Have you been working
on any new songs, Arch?

30:58.940 --> 31:00.400
I'd love to hear some of them.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.402
I haven't played guitar in forever.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.404
I'm not the same person anymore.

31:09.868 --> 31:10.994
I don't wanna do this.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.372
-I don't wanna play with you.
-You have to.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.876
-It's the only way back.
-Back to what?

31:17.959 --> 31:19.168
Eldervair.

31:20.128 --> 31:20.962
Riverdale.
Innocence.

31:31.347 --> 31:32.432
Come on, Arch.

31:35.977 --> 31:36.978
Time to play.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.927
[Betty] <i>Thanks for meeting me</i>
<i>on such short notice.</i>

32:09.510 --> 32:12.597
A lot of the freed patients
from Sisters of Quiet Mercy

32:12.680 --> 32:16.351
have been orphaned or disowned.

32:16.434 --> 32:19.646
My mom and I have been housing them,
but that is becoming...

32:20.480 --> 32:21.564
untenable.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.734
So, if any of you are willing or able

32:24.817 --> 32:25.985
to take a few in,

32:26.527 --> 32:28.821
just until the Sisters testify
against Hiram,

32:28.905 --> 32:30.031
and he's behind bars--

32:30.114 --> 32:33.701
I could take, you know, some of the boys.

32:34.327 --> 32:36.496
And with Archie gone, I have the room.

32:37.747 --> 32:41.960
I've saved many children
from that particular circle of hell before

32:42.043 --> 32:44.045
and I'm happy to do it again.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.591
Nana and I will board some girls
at Thistlehouse.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.176
And we have a pull-out here.

32:50.802 --> 32:51.970
I'll house a couple.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.138
Thank you.

32:54.722 --> 32:56.683
[FP]<i> What about this deal with the Lodges?</i>

32:56.766 --> 32:58.059
Veronica, not the Lodges.

32:58.142 --> 32:58.977
Oh.

32:59.435 --> 33:01.896
She's still a Lodge, boy.
Don't ever forget it.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.983
As I recall,
you worked for the Lodges once.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.652
Does trashing that drive-in
ring any bells?

33:07.735 --> 33:09.821
I want you to be a better king than me.

33:09.904 --> 33:14.242
-Make us players, instead of pawns.
-That's what I'm trying to do, Dad.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.368
Put me in.

33:16.369 --> 33:19.288
I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines.
I'm not made for it.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.563
-We gotta stop meeting like this.
-[distorted voice] Shut your mouth.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.530
Trash the cargo. All of it.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.452
-Let's go.
-[man] Come on. It's an ambush.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.163
Get them.

34:02.540 --> 34:03.458
Tried to tell you.

34:04.417 --> 34:05.460
Get him up.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.176
I want you to go back
to your Gargoyle King,

34:13.551 --> 34:15.762
or your Man in Black, or Hiram Lodge,

34:15.845 --> 34:19.223
and I want you to tell him
that Veronica is now under the protection

34:19.307 --> 34:20.349
of the Serpents,

34:20.725 --> 34:23.519
and that Riverdale has not fallen.

34:25.897 --> 34:26.939
Go.

34:42.705 --> 34:43.539
Mom?

34:47.752 --> 34:49.879
Where are they? Where are the kids?

34:51.047 --> 34:56.010
After that one was attacked,
I called Edgar, and asked him for advice,

34:56.469 --> 34:58.513
and he came, and took them to the Farm.

34:59.931 --> 35:00.932
Edgar did?

35:01.015 --> 35:03.184
You only missed him by,
like, five minutes.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.858
It's your turn, Archie.
You have to pick a Quest Card.

35:20.326 --> 35:21.494
Is this the last level?

35:21.577 --> 35:23.371
Sure feels like it, doesn't it?

36:30.146 --> 36:32.023
You don't have to do this, son.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.653
He's the one who got me into this trouble.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.239
Not the Black Hood.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.577
Not the Gargoyle King, not Hiram Lodge.

36:45.661 --> 36:46.495
Him.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.331
It's the only way.

36:48.998 --> 36:50.166
You could forgive him.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.752
It's too late.

36:55.421 --> 36:58.257
You are not the villain you think you are.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.219
I've hurt everyone.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.138
There's always another path home, son.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.309
Not for me.

37:10.436 --> 37:12.647
If I ever wanna go back
to Riverdale again...

37:13.564 --> 37:16.108
I have to destroy that part of me...

37:17.318 --> 37:18.319
that's weak...

37:19.028 --> 37:20.363
that's bad, that's stupid.

37:22.448 --> 37:23.616
Just come home, Archie.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.411
I can't, Dad.

37:32.541 --> 37:34.252
I have to do this one thing first.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.173
I'm sorry, Dad.
