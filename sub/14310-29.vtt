WEBVTT

00:01.129 --> 00:03.020
[theme music]

00:05.089 --> 00:08.119
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.140 --> 00:12.089
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.109 --> 00:15.009
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:15.029 --> 00:16.230
They were good.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.140
[theme music]

00:22.079 --> 00:26.129
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.149 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.039
Oh, I hate Smurfs.

00:31.059 --> 00:34.020
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.039 --> 00:36.049
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:36.070 --> 00:38.140
[evil laughter]

00:38.159 --> 00:39.149
Unh!

00:39.170 --> 00:41.100
Oh, I'll get you.

00:41.119 --> 00:44.140
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:44.159 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there

00:47.049 --> 00:51.079
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.200
And if you are good,
you may just

00:53.219 --> 00:56.219
catch a glimpse
of the Smurfs.

00:59.009 --> 01:00.140
[theme music]

01:06.090 --> 01:09.030
(Papa Smurf)
Alright, Smurfs, heave.

01:09.049 --> 01:10.219
[all grunting]

01:15.010 --> 01:16.150
I hate heaving.

01:16.170 --> 01:20.150
- Here, hold my toolbox, Clumsy.
- Oh, uh, sure, Brainy.

01:21.219 --> 01:24.079
(Hefty)
Whoa!

01:24.099 --> 01:28.060
(Grouchy)
Whoa! Help! Stop!

01:28.079 --> 01:30.019
(Lazy)
Help! Stop!

01:30.039 --> 01:32.049
[Papa Smurf groaning]

01:33.200 --> 01:34.180
Yeow!

01:34.200 --> 01:37.090
Oh! Oh, my foot.

01:37.109 --> 01:38.210
[groans]

01:38.229 --> 01:43.129
I need my snowflower pollen
to reduce the swelling. Ohh.

01:44.159 --> 01:46.129
But it's back in my lab.

01:46.150 --> 01:49.150
Don't worry, Papa Smurf.
I'll get it for you.

01:50.219 --> 01:52.129
Clumsy, this was all your fault.

01:52.150 --> 01:54.210
So, you better get that
snowflower pollen right away

01:54.229 --> 01:56.170
or Papa Smurf
may never forgive you.

01:56.189 --> 01:58.200
Oh, golly.

02:05.060 --> 02:08.008
Uh, here I come, Papa Smurf.
As fast as I--

02:08.030 --> 02:09.189
I'll take it from here, Clumsy.

02:09.210 --> 02:12.219
- Huh?
- I've got it, Papa Smurf.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.210
Uh, but, Brainy,
that's no fair. I..

02:15.229 --> 02:18.009
- Whoops!
- Whoa!

02:18.030 --> 02:19.079
I've got it.

02:19.099 --> 02:21.210
[all yelling]

02:21.229 --> 02:24.199
Ugh! And I've had it!

02:24.219 --> 02:27.009
[chuckles]
Don't worry, Papa Smurf.

02:27.030 --> 02:29.180
I'll get you plenty more
snowflower pollen.

02:29.199 --> 02:34.079
[sighs]
But there's only one snowflower
in the entire world.

02:34.099 --> 02:37.050
And it only blooms once a year.

02:37.069 --> 02:40.069
In fact, it should be
blooming now.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.069
Just tell me where it is
and I'll go get it.

02:42.090 --> 02:44.170
I'm glad you feel
that way, Brainy.

02:44.189 --> 02:46.170
Because the snowflower I need

02:46.189 --> 02:50.020
grows at the top
of Ice Mountain.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.069
(Smurfs)
'Ice Mountain?'

02:55.150 --> 02:58.199
Now remember, Smurfs,
you mustn't pick the snowflower.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.139
Just bring back the pollen.

03:00.159 --> 03:04.099
That way, the flower can
continue to bloom each year.

03:04.120 --> 03:08.090
(Hefty)
'Right, Papa Smurf. Forward ho!'

03:08.110 --> 03:10.099
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.139
- 'Bye, Papa Smurf.'
- 'Bye.'

03:12.159 --> 03:16.000
Bon voyage.
Your bravery will not be for..

03:16.219 --> 03:18.219
Oh!

03:19.000 --> 03:21.189
(Brainy)
Hefty, I'm thirsty
and, uh, and, uh

03:21.210 --> 03:24.020
I-I forgot
to go to the bathroom.

03:24.039 --> 03:28.110
And, um, I didn't make my bed,
so can I go back?

03:28.129 --> 03:30.069
(Hefty)
Will you relax, Brainy?

03:30.090 --> 03:33.060
There's nothing to worry about.
Nothing at all.

03:34.069 --> 03:36.079
[dramatic music]

03:40.229 --> 03:42.050
[growls]

03:48.020 --> 03:52.090
Hefty, I have a funny feeling
we're being watched.

03:52.110 --> 03:55.189
Watched? Ha-ha-ha!
Aw, come on, Smurfette.

03:58.090 --> 04:02.000
All of a sudden, this place
is giving me the creeps too.

04:02.020 --> 04:05.229
Let's just find that snowflower
pollen and get out of here.

04:06.009 --> 04:08.069
Ooh, look. There it is.

04:08.090 --> 04:10.169
'Isn't it beautiful?'

04:10.189 --> 04:13.199
(Jokey)
Last one to the
snowflower is a frozen Smurf.

04:13.219 --> 04:16.079
[Jokey laughs]

04:16.100 --> 04:20.040
(Jokey)
Hey, where'd this big hole
come from?

04:20.060 --> 04:22.019
(Hefty)
I don't know.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.079
(Brainy)
And I don't think
we want to f-find out.

04:24.100 --> 04:29.000
Oh. Let's just get that pollen
and head for home.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.120
Okay, easy there. Careful.

04:32.139 --> 04:35.149
[grunts]
I can't go any higher.

04:35.170 --> 04:37.220
I'm the lightest Smurf here.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.029
Try lifting me up.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.199
This is risky, Smurfette.
Maybe you better not.

04:42.220 --> 04:44.220
No, no. I'm fine.

04:45.000 --> 04:45.230
[cracking]

04:46.009 --> 04:47.100
[screaming]

04:50.029 --> 04:51.180
[Smurfette screams]

04:51.199 --> 04:53.050
Smurfette!

04:53.069 --> 04:55.209
(all)
Whoa!

04:55.230 --> 04:57.139
[screams]

05:00.069 --> 05:02.120
What-what happened?

05:02.139 --> 05:03.149
[gasps]

05:03.170 --> 05:06.050
[cooing]

05:06.069 --> 05:08.149
Our Smurfette's gone.

05:08.170 --> 05:09.230
[sobs]

05:10.009 --> 05:12.100
We'll never forget you,
Smurfette.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.230
[all crying]

05:20.060 --> 05:23.189
The least we can do is honor
Smurfette's final wish

05:23.209 --> 05:26.060
and deliver this to Papa Smurf.

05:26.079 --> 05:28.170
(Smurfs)
'Yeah. That's right.'

05:29.220 --> 05:32.170
[all grunting]

05:33.170 --> 05:37.069
(all)
Whoa!

05:37.090 --> 05:39.199
It's no use. We're trapped.

05:39.220 --> 05:43.129
Trapped? Oh, I knew it.
I knew it.

05:43.149 --> 05:45.110
Papa Smurf!

05:45.129 --> 05:47.100
Keep calm, everybody.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.040
Now, we have to let Papa Smurf
know we're in trouble.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.199
Uh, maybe we can
send smoke signals.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.090
[groans]

05:55.110 --> 05:57.139
I wonder what's keeping
those smurfs.

05:57.159 --> 05:59.139
They should've been back
long ago.

05:59.159 --> 06:03.060
- Would you stop that?
- Uh, sorry, Papa Smurf.

06:03.079 --> 06:06.170
Papa Smurf, look.

06:06.189 --> 06:09.079
(Papa Smurf)
Smurf smoke signals
from Ice Mountain.

06:09.100 --> 06:12.189
My Smurfs need me.
Quickly, bring a sled.

06:14.009 --> 06:16.149
[dramatic music]

06:16.170 --> 06:19.050
(Smurfette)
Please, put me down. Please.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.029
[snowbeast babbling]

06:24.009 --> 06:25.170
[chuckles]

06:25.189 --> 06:28.100
Please. Please,
don't keep me here.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.209
I just want to go back
to my friends.

06:30.230 --> 06:32.050
[groans]

06:32.069 --> 06:33.149
Unh-unh.

06:33.170 --> 06:35.170
[mumbles]
Smurfette stays with me.

06:35.189 --> 06:39.230
Look, I don't belong to you
and I don't belong here.

06:40.009 --> 06:41.110
Now let me go.

06:42.149 --> 06:44.199
[crying]

06:44.220 --> 06:47.000
Aw, don't cry.

06:47.019 --> 06:49.060
I appreciate your gift.

06:49.079 --> 06:50.180
It's just that I'm..

06:50.199 --> 06:52.000
[sneezes]

06:52.019 --> 06:53.199
...freezing in here.

06:53.220 --> 06:55.129
[grunting]

07:01.060 --> 07:05.009
T-t-thank you,
b-but I'm starving too.

07:05.029 --> 07:06.160
[sneezes]

07:06.180 --> 07:09.120
[mumbles]
Dinner is served.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.120
Mm.

07:17.139 --> 07:21.069
Oh, but I need more
than just an icicle.

07:21.189 --> 07:23.110
Hm.

07:23.129 --> 07:24.230
[mumbles]
I know.

07:29.209 --> 07:33.110
A-a-achoo!

07:33.129 --> 07:36.079
- Huh?
- Oh, boo!

07:36.100 --> 07:39.050
If only Papa Smurf were here.

07:39.069 --> 07:42.129
Oh, if only Papa Smurf
were here.

07:42.149 --> 07:43.159
[Clumsy sniffles]

07:43.180 --> 07:45.029
[sobbing]
And Smurfette.

07:46.189 --> 07:49.000
[all gasp]

07:49.019 --> 07:51.110
[all screaming]

07:51.129 --> 07:53.199
Run, Smurfs, run!

07:53.220 --> 07:56.209
- We're running. We're running.
- We're running. We're running.

07:56.230 --> 07:59.139
[groaning]

07:59.159 --> 08:01.180
[snowbeast screams]

08:01.199 --> 08:04.009
[yelping]

08:04.230 --> 08:07.050
Now he's really mad.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.139
And we're really cornered.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.230
Our only hope
is to make a stand.

08:12.009 --> 08:14.149
Come on, Smurfs,
let him have it.

08:14.170 --> 08:15.199
(Clumsy)
Go away!

08:15.220 --> 08:17.029
[all yelling]

08:18.230 --> 08:20.149
[grunting]

08:24.089 --> 08:25.220
Let me out of here.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.100
[all clamoring]

08:28.120 --> 08:31.120
(Papa Smurf)
Good work, Smurfs.
We're almost there.

08:31.139 --> 08:34.100
'Stop. This is the place
where the snowflower'

08:34.120 --> 08:37.200
used to grow,
but it's gone.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.200
(Dreamy)
And so are the other smurfs.

08:39.220 --> 08:42.210
From the look of things,
there was a snow slide here

08:42.230 --> 08:46.129
and all our dear little Smurfs
were swept away.

08:47.039 --> 08:48.149
Poor Greedy.

08:48.169 --> 08:51.230
We've heard his stomach growl
for the last time.

08:52.009 --> 08:57.019
And Clumsy will never be able
to drop a log on my good foot.

08:57.039 --> 08:58.029
[sobs]

08:58.049 --> 09:00.019
[all crying]

09:00.039 --> 09:03.129
(Smurfs)
'Help! Help!'

09:03.149 --> 09:06.080
- Our beloved smurfs.
- 'Help! Help!'

09:06.100 --> 09:09.110
- 'Help! Help!'
- They're alive.

09:09.129 --> 09:12.059
[snowbeast growling]

09:12.080 --> 09:13.129
(Smurfette)
Help!

09:13.149 --> 09:15.039
(all)
Smurfette.

09:15.059 --> 09:17.070
(Smurfette)
'Help!'

09:17.090 --> 09:19.029
(all)
She's alive.

09:19.049 --> 09:21.070
[grunting]

09:21.090 --> 09:25.120
- Papa Smurf.
- Are we glad to see you.

09:25.139 --> 09:28.029
Here, we got the snowflower
for you.

09:28.049 --> 09:31.230
Excellent! Now, let's follow
that beast to Smurfette.

09:32.009 --> 09:35.039
- I'll treat my foot on the way.
- 'Help!'

09:36.230 --> 09:40.029
Oh, help! Somebody help!

09:40.049 --> 09:41.029
[spider hissing]

09:41.049 --> 09:44.059
[snowbeast grunting]

09:45.120 --> 09:47.169
[mumbles]
That's my Smurf.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.080
Oh, thank you, snowbeast.

09:52.100 --> 09:55.070
That's the second time
you've saved my life.

09:55.090 --> 09:59.000
Oh, what happened
to your poor foot?

09:59.019 --> 10:01.070
[mumbling]

10:06.190 --> 10:10.039
There he is.
Smurfette must be inside.

10:10.059 --> 10:12.169
(Hefty)
Don't worry, we've got him now.

10:12.190 --> 10:15.019
[growling]

10:15.039 --> 10:17.019
(Smurfs)
Whoa!

10:17.039 --> 10:18.230
[chuckles]

10:19.009 --> 10:20.049
Huh?

10:20.070 --> 10:21.129
Charge.

10:22.169 --> 10:24.009
Uh-oh.

10:24.029 --> 10:25.210
[yells]

10:26.000 --> 10:28.149
[snowbeast grunting]

10:28.169 --> 10:31.049
(Smurfette)
'Wait. Where are you taking me?'

10:31.070 --> 10:32.210
(Vanity)
Come back, you coward.

10:32.230 --> 10:35.159
- Yeah.
- Come back here!

10:35.179 --> 10:38.070
[whimpering]

10:38.090 --> 10:40.049
(Jokey)
We've got him cornered.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.149
(Smurfs)
Yeah.

10:41.169 --> 10:43.090
(Harmony)
Give us Smurfette.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.179
(Jokey)
Yeah, give us Smurfette.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.090
[crying]

10:47.110 --> 10:51.019
All of you, stop.
You're scaring him.

10:51.039 --> 10:52.159
(all)
Huh?

10:52.179 --> 10:54.200
This poor snowbeast isn't evil.

10:54.220 --> 10:58.210
He's just lonely
and wants me to stay here.

10:58.230 --> 11:03.070
Snowbeast,
we don't mean you any harm.

11:03.090 --> 11:06.230
This snowflower pollen
will heal your sore foot.

11:08.029 --> 11:09.059
[sighs]

11:09.080 --> 11:11.059
[chuckles]

11:11.080 --> 11:15.090
You see, snowflowers
can only exist in ice and snow

11:15.110 --> 11:18.120
and Smurfette can only live
in the warm climate

11:18.139 --> 11:20.029
of the Smurf Village.

11:20.049 --> 11:23.070
'Like the snowflower,
there is only one Smurfette'

11:23.090 --> 11:25.019
in all the world.

11:25.039 --> 11:29.029
And now, the snowflower
is no more.

11:29.049 --> 11:30.080
[grunts excitedly]

11:35.059 --> 11:36.129
[all gasp]

11:36.149 --> 11:40.110

(Papa Smurf)
'Remember, take only
what we need.'

11:49.080 --> 11:52.009
Thank you for sharing
your snowflowers with us.

11:52.029 --> 11:55.110
May we return next year
when they bloom again?

11:55.129 --> 11:57.230
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:58.009 --> 12:02.009
That means we'll see each other
every year too.

Goodbye. See you next year.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.049

Bye.

[babbling]

12:15.019 --> 12:17.129
Today, we honor
those beloved Smurfs

12:17.149 --> 12:20.070
who risked their lives
seeking the snowflower.

12:20.090 --> 12:22.210
We're so glad you're home.

12:22.230 --> 12:24.159
[all cheering]

12:28.059 --> 12:30.139
Ah, and I thought you'd be dead.

12:30.159 --> 12:33.080
Nope. Just out of food.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.159
- Have some more cake?
- More sarsaparilla?

12:36.179 --> 12:38.100
[Greedy mumbling]

12:38.120 --> 12:40.029
Don't mind if I do.

12:40.049 --> 12:43.179
Got a surprise for you,
Papa Smurf.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.000

12:45.019 --> 12:47.039

12:47.059 --> 12:50.139
[sighs]
Yes, in spite of everything

12:50.159 --> 12:54.090
it's good to have things
back to normal.

12:54.110 --> 12:56.230
