00:28.376 --> 00:29.725
- Yeah.
- Woo-hoo!

00:29.768 --> 00:33.250
Ah, what a great day
for a beach day, Titans.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.339
The sun is so bright and warm

00:35.383 --> 00:37.274
that I don't care that
it's slowly damaging my skin.

00:37.298 --> 00:40.866
And this ice cold water
is so refreshing.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.694
Beach days are the best, yo.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.435
Friends, look,

00:44.479 --> 00:46.785
I have found
the sunken treasure.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.222
Uh, those are
bottle caps, Star.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.790
Whoa!

00:51.834 --> 00:54.532
I think
I've caught a big one.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.495
Yo, guys, check out
all these jellyfish.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.888
Ew, those aren't jelly fish.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.847
They're plastic bags.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.199
Ugh, this water is nasty, yo.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.940
There's only one thing
to do about it.

01:10.983 --> 01:13.943
Titans, commence
Operation Cleanup!

01:26.695 --> 01:28.479
Aw, man, we didn't even
make a dent.

01:28.523 --> 01:31.352
We need to figure out
what's going on
and put a stop to it.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.137
Whoa.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.226
Guys, there's a name
on this bottle.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.577
I bet you, this Pete person
knows something
about this garbage.

01:39.621 --> 01:41.144
Then we better track him down.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.319
Titans, go!

01:42.363 --> 01:43.320
Pete?

01:43.364 --> 01:44.974
- Yo, Pete!
- Pete?

01:45.017 --> 01:46.697
Here, the Petey, Petey,
Petey, Petey, Pete.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.151
Pete?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.418
Pete?

01:54.462 --> 01:56.159
Pete!

01:56.768 --> 01:58.596
Hey! Aah!

01:58.640 --> 02:00.903
-Pete?

02:00.946 --> 02:02.339
Pete!
- Pete!

02:02.383 --> 02:03.645
Pete!

02:03.688 --> 02:05.603
We're never going
to find this Pete-foo,

02:05.647 --> 02:07.257
Over here!

02:07.301 --> 02:08.563
Who said that?

02:08.606 --> 02:10.913
We did.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.456
Dude, those water bottles
are talking to you.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.222
Oh, we're not
just simple water bottles.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.792
We're also magical molecules.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.794
- What?
- No way.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.318
Who are you guys?

02:24.361 --> 02:26.450
I am Polyethylene.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.799
Polly for short.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.845
And I am Terephthalate.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.977
But you can call me Tara.

02:32.021 --> 02:35.067
And when we combine,
we become...

02:35.111 --> 02:36.330
Pete!

02:36.373 --> 02:38.288
But what exactly is "Pete"?

02:38.332 --> 02:41.291
It's the most versatile plastic
on the planet.

02:41.335 --> 02:44.294
Which means we can transform
from simple water bottles

02:44.338 --> 02:46.731
into a variety
of cool new products.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.168
Like this!

02:48.211 --> 02:51.345
By the power of Pete,
recycle into...

02:51.388 --> 02:52.868
A playground!

02:52.911 --> 02:54.217
Whoa!

02:54.261 --> 02:55.261
Or...

02:57.046 --> 02:59.353
Thermobond packaging!

02:59.396 --> 03:01.181
Or, best of all...

03:03.313 --> 03:06.098
Ugly holiday sweaters!

03:06.142 --> 03:08.188
But how is this the possible?

03:08.231 --> 03:10.581
Are you two some kind
of wizards or something?

03:10.625 --> 03:11.800
No, silly.

03:11.843 --> 03:12.931
It's only possible

03:12.975 --> 03:15.543
through the power of recycling.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.980
We'll show you how it works.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.025
The process starts right here

03:20.069 --> 03:23.028
where recycled bottles
are fed into this machine,

03:23.072 --> 03:24.508
which removes their waste.

03:24.552 --> 03:27.381
Uh, so this is where them
bottles go to take a poop?

03:27.424 --> 03:29.513
Oh, no, no,
not that kind of waste.

03:29.557 --> 03:32.255
This machine removes labels,
stray pieces of metal,

03:32.299 --> 03:34.692
and any form
of contaminated plastic.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.260
Can the plastic become
the contaminated?

03:37.304 --> 03:42.700
Yes, if it's been exposed
to dirt or toxic substances.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.877
Which is why you should
never mix your plastic
with your garbage.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.705
Because then
it cannot be recycled.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.229
Thanks for the tip, yo.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.361
Next the bottles are taken
over to this machine

03:51.405 --> 03:53.450
where they get washed
and dried.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.931
You think we could run Robin
through that machine?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.542
He is in desperate need
of the shower.

03:58.586 --> 03:59.674
I don't need a shower!

04:02.111 --> 04:06.246
Finally, the bottles
are chopped up
and melted into tiny pellets,

04:06.289 --> 04:08.291
which can be made
into new products

04:08.335 --> 04:11.947
like carpets, furniture,
or even tote bags.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.818
But you don't need
a fancy recycling center

04:13.862 --> 04:15.820
like this one to recycle.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.345
You can just as easily
recycle at home

04:18.388 --> 04:21.086
by finding new uses
for the things you own

04:21.130 --> 04:22.958
instead of throwing them away.

04:23.001 --> 04:26.570
Like turning this soda bottle
into a planter
for an urban garden.

04:26.614 --> 04:29.312
Wow. I never knew
a plastic bottle
was so valuable.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.575
Them bottles
be plastic gold, yo.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.317
But... if all of this
plastic can be recycled,

04:34.361 --> 04:36.624
then why is so much of it
ending up in the ocean?

04:36.667 --> 04:39.975
Because only 9%
of plastic waste

04:40.018 --> 04:41.716
ever gets recycled.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.980
Only the 9%?

04:45.023 --> 04:48.026
Ugh... That makes me so angry!

04:48.070 --> 04:50.246
Hmm, that is
a shockingly low number.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.378
Yes, it is.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.075
Which means
the rest of the plastic

04:53.118 --> 04:54.598
ends up in the ocean,

04:54.642 --> 04:56.818
where it gets sucked
into the great garbage patch.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.777
That must be what's attracting
all of the garbage
near our home.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.126
Can you take us there?

05:01.170 --> 05:03.041
Of course,
but you'll never get in

05:03.085 --> 05:04.216
looking like that.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.522
How come?

05:05.566 --> 05:07.350
Because the patch is ruled
by an evil warlord

05:07.394 --> 05:09.831
who only allows garbage
onto his island.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.528
Well, that won't be
a problem for us.

05:11.572 --> 05:14.618
Yeah, people been
calling us garbage
since the reboot.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.754
That's pretty funny.

05:19.797 --> 05:20.798
Titans, go!

05:20.842 --> 05:22.365
To the great garbage patch!

05:34.377 --> 05:37.293
Whoa, look at the size
of this place.

05:42.167 --> 05:45.519
I told you, only garbage
is allowed passage.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.134
Garbage verified.

05:55.616 --> 05:58.096
See, I told you
people think we're trash.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.189
Whoa, check it out.

06:06.104 --> 06:09.020
I've never seen so much trash
in all my days.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.674
This place is depressing.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.680
What is the happening?

06:16.724 --> 06:17.942
This doesn't look good.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.946
Hyah!

06:21.990 --> 06:25.907
Major Alcuranitro Butane Styrene!

06:25.950 --> 06:28.300
That's Major ABS
to you, civilians.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.956
Just check out this six-pack.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.523
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

06:33.567 --> 06:36.570
Now, tell me, what are you kids
doing on my island?

06:36.613 --> 06:39.050
We came here to make you
clean up your act.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.530
You can forget it, mini-boy.

06:40.574 --> 06:43.838
Why do you insist upon living
on this island of trash?

06:43.881 --> 06:45.187
I'll tell you why, miss.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.494
I was once a simple toy,
hoorah,

06:47.537 --> 06:49.670
<i>who dreamed of being recycled
into something new</i>

06:49.713 --> 06:52.237
<i>like one of those delightful
little garden gnomes.</i>

06:52.281 --> 06:54.849
<i>But when it came time
for me to be recycled,</i>

06:54.892 --> 06:56.241
<i>I was rejected</i>

06:56.285 --> 06:58.374
<i>because my local
recycling center</i>

06:58.418 --> 07:01.421
<i>wouldn't recycle
my ABS plastic body.</i>

07:01.464 --> 07:04.554
<i>And, instead, I was dumped
into the ocean. Hoorah...</i>

07:04.598 --> 07:07.209
<i>Where I came up
with a new dream.</i>

07:07.252 --> 07:09.733
<i>I would build a mighty weapon
out of garbage</i>

07:09.777 --> 07:13.824
<i>to exact my revenge
on the cruel business
of recycling.</i>

07:13.868 --> 07:17.132
So you're going to get revenge
with this garbage patch?

07:17.175 --> 07:18.438
No. Hoorah.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.918
This is only the surface
of my weapon

07:28.056 --> 07:30.406
This is my full weapon.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.062
I call it the Contaminator!
Hoorah!

07:34.105 --> 07:36.586
And, with this machine,
I shall contaminate

07:36.630 --> 07:40.460
exactly 9% of the world's
recyclable plastic.

07:40.503 --> 07:44.202
But if you do that, then
nothing will get the recycled.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.727
And all of our recycling
centers will be destroyed.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.337
Hoorah! That's the plan!

07:48.380 --> 07:50.470
Well, your plan ends here.

07:50.513 --> 07:53.951
You don't have the power
to stop me. Hoorah!

07:55.997 --> 07:57.302
Yes, we do,

07:57.346 --> 07:59.957
because we've got
the power of recycling.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.393
Right!

08:01.437 --> 08:04.396
By the power of Pete,
recycling to...

08:04.440 --> 08:06.311
Furniture!

08:06.355 --> 08:07.791
Incoming!

08:09.097 --> 08:10.620
Recycling to...

08:10.664 --> 08:12.013
tote bag!

08:16.931 --> 08:18.976
I'm gonna squash
you ninnies flat.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.630
Hoorah!

08:20.674 --> 08:22.153
Recycling to...

08:22.197 --> 08:24.068
carpet!

08:29.204 --> 08:30.553
Face it, Major,

08:30.597 --> 08:33.513
you're no match
for the power of recycling!

08:33.556 --> 08:36.254
Then let's see how you
handle some toxic waste.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.610
Recycling to...

08:46.395 --> 08:48.789
Oh, no!
We've been contaminated!

08:48.832 --> 08:51.400
So transform into something
to clean yourselves up.

08:51.443 --> 08:52.662
It doesn't work like that.

08:52.706 --> 08:53.986
Now that we've been
contaminated,

08:54.011 --> 08:55.535
we can't transform.

08:55.578 --> 08:58.668
Hoorah! You recyclers
are pathetic!

08:58.712 --> 09:01.671
If anyone's a big recycler,
it's you.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.238
Me? A recycler?

09:03.281 --> 09:05.675
Never! Ooh... No!

09:05.719 --> 09:08.243
By creating your super weapon
out of trash,

09:08.286 --> 09:10.593
you gave new purpose
to all of this waste.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.640
Which is another way
you can recycle.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.645
Hoorah. You're right.

09:22.170 --> 09:25.826
You know, perhaps there's more
to this recycling business
than I thought.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.829
But what's going to happen
to all of this garbage?

09:28.872 --> 09:30.613
Don't worry, we have a plan.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.718
Hoorah!

09:48.762 --> 09:50.981
You turned all that garbage
into this?

09:51.025 --> 09:52.374
Indeed.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.072
We used the plastic bags
for the flower beds.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.596
Water bottles for fledgers.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.076
And turned these milk jugs
into bird feeders.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.036
We didn't forget
about you, bro.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.125
Which is why we made you this.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.258
A garden gnome outfit?

10:07.302 --> 10:09.260
Hoorah!

10:09.304 --> 10:10.740
This is amazing!

10:10.784 --> 10:13.743
Thanks for making my dream
come true, Titans.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.267
I love recycling

10:16.311 --> 10:19.357
Hoorah!
We saved the world!
