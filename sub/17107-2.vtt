NARRATOR (OFFSCREEN): Previously
on Dance Academy.

00:04.200 --> 00:06.799
-Some space has temporarily
opened up in the quarter

00:06.839 --> 00:09.640
ballet, so the company are
considering taking some third

00:09.679 --> 00:12.320
years in for the rest of
the Sydney season.

00:12.359 --> 00:14.599
-Sir Jeffrey has a list of
who fits his vision.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.160
-Where am I on the list?

00:16.199 --> 00:17.120
-Your legs.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.480
He likes them longer.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.440
-I lied to everyone that
I know where you are.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.480
I think I just need to believe
that you're OK.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.320
[theme music]

01:19.480 --> 01:20.640
-You know, it's funny.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.439
I've only ever taken that
bus once or twice.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.200
It's a bit of a mission,
isn't it?

01:25.239 --> 01:28.439
-It was OK, gave me time to
hone my Sudoku skills.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.799
-Ah!

01:30.840 --> 01:31.599
-Thanks.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.799
-You're welcome.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.200
-So it's great you guys
have been spending

01:38.239 --> 01:40.200
so much time together.

01:40.239 --> 01:45.200
-Yeah, yeah, he didn't tell me
that school had gone back.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.840
-It's nearly March, Raf.

01:46.879 --> 01:49.239
You probably could have
worked it out.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.400
-Hey, how are you?

01:50.439 --> 01:51.439
-Freezing.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.599
-Oh, yeah, and I forgot.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.840
Tara called the other day.

01:53.879 --> 01:57.040
And, uh, I said she should
come up and say hi.

01:59.799 --> 02:02.120
Anyway, you guys probably
want to--

02:02.159 --> 02:03.319
and I should--

02:08.439 --> 02:09.360
-So what's happening?

02:09.400 --> 02:11.159
Have you been doing
any classes?

02:11.199 --> 02:13.439
-Yeah, at the Kingston Center
for Classical Arts.

02:17.439 --> 02:19.840
-Christian, I'm sorry
for just showing up.

02:19.879 --> 02:21.479
But you promised you'd
come back.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.039
And I can handle you breaking
that promise.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.800
But then totally falling
off the grid?

02:25.840 --> 02:27.319
You didn't think we'd
worry about you?

02:27.360 --> 02:28.159
-Who's we?

02:28.199 --> 02:29.080
-Everyone.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.400
Your friends.

02:30.439 --> 02:32.240
-I've got friends here.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.199
Have a great trip back.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.639
TARA (OFSCREEN): So no secret.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.479
I've dreamt about it and
stressed about it

02:48.520 --> 02:49.800
and worked for it.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.159
And now, I'm in it--

02:52.199 --> 02:53.120
the company.

02:53.159 --> 02:55.639
OK, so only temporarily,
but still.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.479
Big step!

02:57.520 --> 03:00.159
-Look, it's genius
on two levels.

03:00.199 --> 03:02.479
They'll find me ironically
hilarious, and actually

03:02.520 --> 03:03.319
remember my name.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.439
Ha!

03:04.479 --> 03:05.680
TARA (OFFSCREEN): I am
taking this whole

03:05.719 --> 03:07.680
experience in my stride.

03:07.719 --> 03:11.159
I am not going to be all deer in
the headlights, freaked out

03:11.199 --> 03:14.319
that I'm performing alongside
my heroes.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.159
I am just going to enjoy the
fact that I'm a part of it,

03:17.199 --> 03:18.400
that I belong.

03:18.439 --> 03:20.319
-Hi, Ben Tickle, ha!

03:20.360 --> 03:21.439
Or the Benster, whichever.

03:21.479 --> 03:23.639
Ah, the call guys, uh,
sent me down here.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.599
Their dressing room's
full, and--

03:25.639 --> 03:27.280
-Oh, yeah that happens
sometimes.

03:27.319 --> 03:29.159
These are for the principles.

03:29.199 --> 03:30.319
But I'm sure you'll
find something.

03:35.639 --> 03:36.800
-I'll just go.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.120
-Please try not to embarrass
us too much?

03:48.479 --> 03:49.639
Um, OK.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.639
-Sorry, I thought that the
world's best ballet student

03:57.680 --> 03:59.319
could take a joke.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.319
-Ah, ha ha, totes.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.840
Yeah, I'm an inside laugher.

04:01.879 --> 04:02.680
-Tara!

04:02.719 --> 04:04.319
-Hi, Isabel.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.280
-Um, I can't believe you
nabbed a spot as well.

04:08.319 --> 04:09.120
How's Ethan?

04:09.159 --> 04:10.360
-No, wait.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.240
Is this the Tara who stole
your boyfriend Tara?

04:12.280 --> 04:13.800
-That was a really
long time ago.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.639
-Oh, look, I was about to dump
him for that scuzzy motocross

04:15.680 --> 04:16.720
guy anyway.

04:16.759 --> 04:18.279
-But still.

04:18.319 --> 04:19.680
[screaming offscreen]

04:23.120 --> 04:24.000
-I don't know the rooms!

04:24.040 --> 04:25.160
I don't understand
this system!

04:34.519 --> 04:37.759
-I'm Abigail Armstrong, dancer,
performer, artist.

04:40.759 --> 04:42.120
-Cut.

04:43.879 --> 04:45.720
You know who's a show
reel expert?

04:45.759 --> 04:46.560
Ethan.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.800
We could do a conference call.

04:47.839 --> 04:49.199
That intro will stand out.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.839
-And I don't need his advice.

04:50.879 --> 04:53.800
-Don't think I haven't noticed
the weird cone of silence

04:53.839 --> 04:57.079
surrounding your Barcelonian
summer.

04:57.120 --> 05:01.279
-How about you save pointless
guess work for your own time?

05:01.319 --> 05:03.600
The company doesn't want me,
so I don't want them.

05:03.639 --> 05:05.399
Plus, there are hundreds of
dance companies around the

05:05.439 --> 05:07.800
world who would be lucky
to have this.

05:07.839 --> 05:08.839
-Arrogance in adversity.

05:08.879 --> 05:10.639
Nice!

05:10.680 --> 05:12.639
So, what's going to
show you off?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.839
Classical, contemp, tae bo?

05:14.879 --> 05:16.639
-I have no idea.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.480
The royal will want classical.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.839
New Prog's gone all
Twyla Tharp.

05:19.879 --> 05:23.800
And NBP will probably want
me reciting Hamlet.

05:23.839 --> 05:25.639
We're covering all bases.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.839
Again?

05:34.519 --> 05:35.720
-You forgot the chicken
sauce today, dog.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.079
Hey, look, for sale.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.319
I need wheels.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.800
-Yeah, you also need
a job mate.

05:45.839 --> 05:46.439
-Shut up.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.480
I got cash.

05:47.519 --> 05:49.759
-Is that why I bought
you chips again?

05:49.800 --> 05:52.160
-Look, the bonnet's dirty.

05:52.199 --> 05:53.360
I reckon I can talk him down.

05:57.639 --> 05:58.800
-You're an idiot.

06:04.639 --> 06:08.399
-Ah, our spring chickens
have arrived.

06:08.439 --> 06:11.240
Come nestle under my
wing and enjoy my

06:11.279 --> 06:12.639
numerous farm yard puns.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.600
-[chicken sounds]

06:14.639 --> 06:15.519
-Ha!

06:15.560 --> 06:16.399
Where shall we start, Rebecca?

06:16.439 --> 06:18.079
-From the start.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.439
-Brilliant.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.639
But, you girls, just watch your
fellow fowl and join in

06:22.680 --> 06:25.639
as soon as you've
picked it up.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.199
[music playing]

06:47.839 --> 06:51.160
-Right, stop there.

06:51.199 --> 06:55.720
Tara, the next performance
is tomorrow night.

06:55.759 --> 06:58.279
-Sorry, could I quickly
ask about motivation?

06:58.319 --> 07:01.639
-Oh, I have a question about
dressing room allocations.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.680
-It's just that I grew
up on a farm.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.079
And one of our chickens, this
speckled hen, she used to

07:06.120 --> 07:09.720
clean herself with
dirt, like this.

07:09.759 --> 07:11.720
-Are you suggesting changes
to the choreography?

07:11.759 --> 07:12.800
-Oh, no, of course not.

07:12.839 --> 07:14.199
It's timeless.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.800
I was just wondering if my
motivation could be sort of

07:15.839 --> 07:18.800
like hen hygiene.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.399
-Off you go!

07:20.439 --> 07:22.800
[music playing]

07:31.800 --> 07:36.600
-Two, and three, and Tara,
chickens may be pea-brained,

07:36.639 --> 07:39.160
but they still need
to dance in time!

07:42.560 --> 07:47.160
I'm assuming that wasn't part
of your hygiene routine.

07:47.199 --> 07:49.279
Farm hands to the
stage, please!

07:53.680 --> 07:56.600
[music playing]

08:17.839 --> 08:18.759
-Ah!

08:18.800 --> 08:20.759
I thought that was
rather lovely.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.399
-It really wasn't.

08:22.439 --> 08:24.800
Next.

08:24.839 --> 08:27.319
[music playing]

08:38.639 --> 08:43.159
-Now repeat after me,
to be or not to

08:43.200 --> 08:44.799
be, that is the question.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.399
-Shut up!

08:47.440 --> 08:50.360
[music playing]

09:25.240 --> 09:26.200
-Whoa!

09:26.240 --> 09:27.399
-Yeah!

09:48.600 --> 09:52.159
-T, public embarrassment is no
excuse for sartorial butchery.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.399
-But the company girls
wear whatever they

09:53.440 --> 09:54.840
want to morning class.

09:54.879 --> 09:56.200
And I know you're going to tell
me not to get sucked into

09:56.240 --> 09:58.679
the whole Miss Popularity
contest, but

09:58.720 --> 10:00.159
ah, who am I kidding?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.200
I'll keep being the
loserish new girl.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.559
-I think you're cool.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.720
-You're wrong.

10:04.759 --> 10:05.879
-Abigail!

10:05.919 --> 10:07.120
Cat said you're applying
to other companies.

10:07.159 --> 10:09.320
-Don't throw a victory
party just yet.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.799
Could you have shot me from
a more unflattering angle?

10:11.840 --> 10:13.360
-Someone's having an
objectivity crisis.

10:13.399 --> 10:15.200
I'll speak to you later.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.720
But let me work my editing
magic overnight while you

10:17.759 --> 10:20.639
peddle, rustle up some
supporting material, like say,

10:20.679 --> 10:22.759
a reference letter from an
esteemed authority figure?

10:22.799 --> 10:25.200
-Don't you have to focus on
your deluded plan to fast

10:25.240 --> 10:26.360
track second year?

10:26.399 --> 10:29.240
-Thing is, since I came
back, you've been--

10:29.279 --> 10:30.480
you're my dancpiration.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.240
-Did you just combine dance
inspiration or dance

10:35.279 --> 10:36.440
desperation?

10:54.320 --> 10:57.559
-Well, well, well, someone
crawled in late.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.639
You can keep sleeping.

10:59.679 --> 11:02.799
You'll have to put a mask on.

11:02.840 --> 11:03.799
Come on.

11:03.840 --> 11:04.759
You're here to work.

11:04.799 --> 11:05.559
We're losing day light.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.080
Let's go!

11:13.080 --> 11:15.200
You're getting good at this.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.519
Here you go.

11:17.559 --> 11:18.720
You have been paying
attention, hey?

11:21.519 --> 11:24.840
-When we have a night out, I'm
borrowing those arm warmers.

11:24.879 --> 11:26.200
-Thanks.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.360
But I think we all know who wins
fashions on the field.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.159
-Ah!

11:37.200 --> 11:38.480
Ah, ha, ha!

11:38.519 --> 11:41.440
Rebecca.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.120
Right, "Giselle"!

11:43.159 --> 11:47.120
Some of you may know it as the
ballet we start rehearsing

11:47.159 --> 11:50.799
next week, or the one for which
we have yet to name our

11:50.840 --> 11:52.360
leading lady.

11:52.399 --> 11:56.240
Now, if you'll care to indulge
me in a little dramatic

11:56.279 --> 11:59.759
reveal, I have managed to lure
back one of the company's

11:59.799 --> 12:02.440
leading lights.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.759
Ah, speak of the devil.

12:03.799 --> 12:05.039
-Devil?

12:05.080 --> 12:07.799
That's a bit unfair!

12:07.840 --> 12:09.320
[applause]

12:12.279 --> 12:13.440
-Well done, well done.

12:17.559 --> 12:19.279
-If I write you a reference
letter now, do you know what

12:19.320 --> 12:21.399
it would say?

12:21.440 --> 12:24.200
Abigail has not yet finished
her training.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.639
It's my job to prepare
dancers for the

12:25.679 --> 12:27.399
National Ballet Company.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.600
In my eyes, you're as much
a contender as anyone.

12:30.639 --> 12:32.639
-Even if I believe that, we both
know at the end of the

12:32.679 --> 12:34.639
year it's not your
eyes that count.

12:34.679 --> 12:36.200
-I don't know why Rebecca
told you what she did.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.399
Look, I'll speak to Sir Jeffrey
and clear it up.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.600
-No, Rebecca is the only one
telling me the truth.

12:41.639 --> 12:43.840
Two years ago in audition week,
you should've taken one

12:43.879 --> 12:46.080
look at my body type and known
I didn't stand a chance with

12:46.120 --> 12:47.039
the company.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.440
Instead, here we are.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.639
With or without your help,
Miss Raine, I'm

12:49.679 --> 12:51.039
finding other options.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.240
-Oh, this is nice.

12:55.279 --> 12:58.559
Great rails, mate.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.080
You know, a few kids have asked
me to teach them this

13:00.120 --> 13:04.039
stuff over the years, but none
of them really have the knack.

13:04.080 --> 13:08.840
Looks like it's, ah, in your
genes or something, hey?

13:08.879 --> 13:11.200
If dancing doesn't do
it for you, at least

13:11.240 --> 13:12.399
you'll have a backup.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.279
-Wait, wait, hold, hold, hold!

13:22.320 --> 13:24.399
What are you doing?

13:24.440 --> 13:25.600
Christian!

13:25.639 --> 13:27.519
-Working in your crappy garage
isn't my idea of

13:27.559 --> 13:29.120
a dream job, OK?

13:29.159 --> 13:31.080
-OK.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.600
Listen, mate, it's been great
having you around here.

13:34.639 --> 13:35.799
-But you're over it, right?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.600
-I didn't say that.

13:37.639 --> 13:40.440
Now, I get that you needed
time to chill out

13:40.480 --> 13:41.080
after your mate died.

13:41.120 --> 13:41.759
I do.

13:41.799 --> 13:42.759
And you know what?

13:42.799 --> 13:44.240
I haven't pushed school
or anything.

13:44.279 --> 13:46.799
But bumming around in Kingston
with those drop kids.

13:46.840 --> 13:47.799
-Are you serious?

13:47.840 --> 13:49.679
You're calling them drop kids?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.399
-Well, it's not helping,
is it?

13:51.440 --> 13:53.600
-A great dad voice you've
been working here, Raf.

13:53.639 --> 13:54.799
Really close.

14:04.159 --> 14:05.480
-Hey.

14:05.519 --> 14:06.639
You talk him down?

14:09.320 --> 14:10.480
Get in already!

14:18.240 --> 14:19.559
-So what was the damage?

14:19.600 --> 14:23.200
-It was an absolute steal.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.159
Look at him.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.799
He seriously believed it!

14:27.840 --> 14:29.279
Dude, this is stupid.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.600
We have to-- we have to return
it before someone realizes.

14:31.639 --> 14:32.320
-Nah.

14:32.360 --> 14:32.799
-Fine.

14:32.840 --> 14:33.840
Let me out.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.480
Let me out, you idiot.

14:37.519 --> 14:38.360
I've got a record.

14:38.399 --> 14:39.519
-Yeah, so does my mom.

14:39.559 --> 14:40.759
-Stop the car!

14:45.840 --> 14:47.679
-Have fun walking
home, douche.

[music playing]

15:30.840 --> 15:32.360
-Christian!

15:32.399 --> 15:33.799
Christian, hey!

15:49.440 --> 15:50.039
-Hey, um--

15:50.080 --> 15:50.799
-Ben!

15:50.840 --> 15:53.320
Must you always be naked?

15:53.360 --> 15:54.519
-What?

15:57.200 --> 15:58.080
-Tara!

15:58.120 --> 15:59.799
-Hey, I was hoping that we'd--

15:59.840 --> 16:00.720
-Are you OK?

16:00.759 --> 16:01.519
-Uh, yes.

16:01.559 --> 16:02.759
Hi.

16:04.759 --> 16:05.559
-I heard about Sammy.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.799
I'm really sorry.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.159
Last year was--

16:09.200 --> 16:11.759
it was a tough year
for all of us.

16:11.799 --> 16:13.120
Anyway, I got you something.

16:16.399 --> 16:19.519
So Jeffrey, bless him, doesn't
always encourage a lot of

16:19.559 --> 16:20.960
creativity in his core.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.360
So whenever I got frustrated, my
mentor had me write things

16:23.399 --> 16:25.759
down as a way to
stay inspired.

16:25.799 --> 16:27.240
-Thanks.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.759
-And if you want me to quickly
take you through the peasant

16:28.799 --> 16:33.039
variation again, your phrasing
was just the tiniest bit off.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.120
-It'll be better tonight.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.360
I'm going to enjoy
the performance

16:35.399 --> 16:37.159
and focus on artistry.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.039
-Were you just listening?

16:39.080 --> 16:40.639
Don't stress about
artistry, OK?

16:40.679 --> 16:42.480
Just nail the steps and
try to blend in.

16:52.519 --> 16:56.679
-So, you know, I was pressed
for editing time.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.159
-Oh, you'll be getting notes.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.279
Where's my intro?

17:06.319 --> 17:07.519
-That was an early casualty.

17:12.839 --> 17:13.720
-Hey, look!

17:13.759 --> 17:15.079
It's a dancing fetus.

17:17.598 --> 17:19.839
No, no, no, seriously, I feel
like some child labor laws

17:19.880 --> 17:20.400
were broken.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.358
-Ssh!

17:29.599 --> 17:30.599
-Where did you get this stuff?

17:30.640 --> 17:32.400
-Apparently I'm a hoarder.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.640
My collection is extensive.

17:49.599 --> 17:51.799
So, what'd you think?

18:16.880 --> 18:18.200
-She used to live over there.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.480
-Kaylah Renikoff?

18:19.519 --> 18:21.440
-I think her and the commish
crew got a job

18:21.480 --> 18:23.160
in Brisbane or something.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.759
Don't you have a date?

18:24.799 --> 18:26.559
-I used to.

18:26.599 --> 18:27.799
It doesn't matter.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.640
You're never going to plant
it if you're hands

18:34.680 --> 18:35.839
are that far across.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.200
-Yeah!

-Woo!

18:44.200 --> 18:45.400
-Whoa!

19:21.480 --> 19:24.119
-I did what you asked.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.799
But I still don't think I made
a mistake accepting you.

19:29.839 --> 19:31.359
-I can't--

19:31.400 --> 19:34.319
I can't face every other company
in the world telling

19:34.359 --> 19:37.240
me that I'm not right for
them, that I'm not good

19:37.279 --> 19:37.720
enough--

19:37.759 --> 19:39.119
-OK, enough!

19:39.160 --> 19:42.160
The speech you're giving me,
the "I quit" speech, I've

19:42.200 --> 19:44.160
heard it 100 times.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.720
But I won't heard it
from you, net yet.

19:46.759 --> 19:49.359
For the next two weeks,
you're off sick.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.279
No classes, no work.

19:51.319 --> 19:52.839
Tell everyone you
have glandular.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.240
-Can we make it something a bit
less disgusting, please?

20:01.559 --> 20:06.480
-After two weeks, if you
still want to quit,

20:06.519 --> 20:09.240
well, we'll talk again.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.400
It was a perfectly respectable
chicken dance.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.039
-All I could think
about was Saskia.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.559
Weird guilt present aside,
she basically told me

not to dance my best.

-Ms. Speckled Hen,
come hither.

22:17.839 --> 22:20.799
As a member of the corps
de ballet, your entire

22:20.839 --> 22:24.599
responsibility is to stay three
inches from the dancer

22:24.640 --> 22:27.640
on your left side, three inches
from the dancer on your

22:27.680 --> 22:31.559
right side, and perfectly mirror
their every movement.

22:31.599 --> 22:35.039
I have no idea what inspired you
to ignore this fundamental

22:35.079 --> 22:38.799
rule, except perhaps the chicken
voice in your head.

22:38.839 --> 22:40.519
-Oh, give her a break!

22:40.559 --> 22:42.680
We were all new once.

It's the company.

22:53.119 --> 22:54.400
It's too important.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.240
-Well, at least you have
Saskia in your corner.

22:56.279 --> 22:59.680
-Which makes everything so
much less confusing!

-Excuse me, can you please
sign my program?

-Yes.

a change in perspective.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.640
Saskia could be right.

I have to inspire myself.
