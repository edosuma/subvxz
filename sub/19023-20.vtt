WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:06.465
Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing.

00:09.968 --> 00:13.263
l can see.

00:14.389 --> 00:18.143
Come on. Let's get out of here.
There's something to do.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.522
There's film festivals,
theatre, there's museums.

00:21.605 --> 00:24.191
Let's get out and get some culture.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.235
Let's put Rowdy on top of the TV

00:26.318 --> 00:28.820
and see who can
throw a hat on him first.

00:28.904 --> 00:32.156
<i>Turk turns everything
into a competition.</i>

00:32.241 --> 00:34.326
<i>It can get annoying.</i>

00:36.495 --> 00:38.580
Let's play ''Steak''.

00:38.664 --> 00:41.917
The first person
to finish their steak is the winner.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.670
l paid $1 7 for this steak,
and l'm not...

00:46.296 --> 00:48.382
You want some?

00:50.467 --> 00:52.469
''Ankles'' is a simple game.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.640
The first one to get embarrassed
and pull up their scrubs loses.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.644
<i>The problem is, these stupid games
always end the same way.</i>

01:02.813 --> 01:04.063
Say it!

01:06.316 --> 01:07.568
Say it!

01:12.197 --> 01:14.741
Just say it.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.619
- l'm your bitch.
- Yes, you are.

01:17.786 --> 01:21.290
<i>Now, sit back baby,
cos Iron Chef is on.</i>

01:37.181 --> 01:39.141
- l win.
- l wasn't racing.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.935
- l was just walking in.
- Good clean win, T-Dog.

01:42.019 --> 01:46.023
Now, let's go down to the caf
and get our doughnut on.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.941
lt wasn't a race!

01:48.025 --> 01:50.944
OK, fine!
Let's just play...

01:51.028 --> 01:53.113
Let's play
''Tip Over the Trash Can''.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.282
OK? l win.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.871
- l win.
- Can l play?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.543
- This is fun.
- Yeah.

02:08.252 --> 02:11.924
Sorry to keep you, Mr Kelly.
l was just...

02:21.350 --> 02:25.187
So, what, are you sick or something?

02:25.270 --> 02:28.899
My heartbeat, it's like,
it's irregular.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.360
- What's the medical word?
- lrregular.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.237
Yeah. That's it.

02:33.320 --> 02:37.699
Of course. The heart.
The old ticker.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.701
You're my doctor?

02:39.785 --> 02:43.121
l have something for you in my pants.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.123
No. Not...

02:45.207 --> 02:47.501
l'm not wearing any pants right now.

02:47.584 --> 02:52.881
My pants are over there, and there's
a note from my GP in the pocket.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.553
lf you guys need me, l'll be under here.

02:57.636 --> 03:02.850
l'm in love with that guy and if l don't
sleep with him, l'll kill myself.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.853
lt's inappropriate
to jump a patient, isn't it?

03:05.936 --> 03:07.563
- Totally.
- Ever done it?

03:07.646 --> 03:10.023
- Tons of times.
- ''Tons of times'' what?

03:10.107 --> 03:12.192
Nothing, baby.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.864
Why hasn't he had a surgical consult?
l'm sorry. That's my fault.

03:16.947 --> 03:21.660
l didn't make it clear how l feel about
things that should already be done.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.539
l almost always wish
things were done already.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.584
Mr Hoffner asked for all his options.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.796
- He never asked for a surgical consult.
- Could l have a surgical consult?

03:32.880 --> 03:35.924
You may have whatever you want.

03:37.843 --> 03:41.722
How is that helpful? Do you get
the doctor-patient relationship?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.765
We're supposed to be a team.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.977
You and me? We're gonna get killed.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.527
For the love of Our Lady
of Guadalupe, that is a fine brew.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.946
- lt's just coffee.
- Oh, no.

03:58.030 --> 04:01.700
This is liquid crack.
This is a mug full of sunshine.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.995
My dear, for me, this is like sex.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.165
ls that why you always
finish so quickly?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.667
And sassy too.
lf you could cook a steak,

04:10.751 --> 04:13.003
l'd eat it right off your bottom.

04:13.086 --> 04:18.509
Ladies. This is that beverage
l've been trying to describe to you,

04:18.591 --> 04:20.928
and it turns out, this is weird,

04:21.011 --> 04:24.681
but the secret is,
you grind it from beans, not crap.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.017
l'll grind your beans.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.020
When are we gonna get it over with?

04:30.103 --> 04:35.234
We are already understaffed, and
Dr Kelso fired two nurses for no reason.

04:35.317 --> 04:40.364
Forgive us if we don't have time
for the Dr Cox show today.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.658
We have to reschedule every nurse.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.911
- What'll we do about lCU...
- We don't need them.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.747
<i>Here's the problem
with a surgical consult.</i>

04:48.830 --> 04:53.627
<i>Mr Hoffner should be treated medically,
but a surgeon will want to slice him.</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:57.673
<i>Surgical and medical interns
are like two rival gangs.</i>

04:57.756 --> 05:02.427
<i>Not real gangs. More like those cheesy
gangs you see in Broadway musicals.</i>

05:21.321 --> 05:25.117
<i>Surgical, medical, surgical, yeah!</i>

05:25.200 --> 05:29.788
<i>Still, I knew there was
one surgical intern I could count on.</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:36.587
<i>If you have some moles
I will inspect them</i>

05:36.670 --> 05:40.591
<i>I'll remove tumours from
your brain to your rectum</i>

05:40.674 --> 05:44.386
<i>Between the two of us
there is no wall</i>

05:44.469 --> 05:46.805
<i>We're a surgeon and a doc</i>

05:46.889 --> 05:51.310
<i>Above it all</i>

05:53.103 --> 05:55.063
<i>A surgeon and a doc</i>

05:55.147 --> 05:59.401
<i>Above it</i>

05:59.484 --> 06:02.029
<i>All</i>

06:02.738 --> 06:07.159
No problem. Whatever you want me
to tell your patient, l'm your guy.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.295
- How are you feeling?
- l'm not tired.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.465
Stress tests are supposed to be hard.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.635
lt helps if you visualise
running toward something,

06:24.718 --> 06:27.679
- like your girlfriend.
- l don't have a girlfriend.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.890
How could you possibly be single?

06:29.973 --> 06:32.726
l don't know.
l'm kind of anal and neurotic.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.728
My God. Me too.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.146
- Really?
- Please!

06:36.230 --> 06:39.733
l like to keep my pens in order
from least to most ink.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.862
That is hot.
l guess the truth is that

06:43.946 --> 06:46.031
l don't go out a lot, you know?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.242
l always seem to
put my foot in my mouth.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.953
l'd let you put your foot in my mouth.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.121
What?

06:53.622 --> 06:56.208
l said l'd let you put
your foot in my mouth.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.877
That's weird.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.796
l know.

07:08.679 --> 07:13.308
Who gets to tell us the symptoms
of Ménière's disease?

07:19.857 --> 07:23.944
- Dr Murphy.
- Can you use it in a sentence?

07:24.027 --> 07:26.905
Sorry to interrupt you there,

07:26.989 --> 07:31.076
but l gotta ask you a quick question.
Now, when you were born, nay,

07:31.159 --> 07:33.287
spawned by the Dark Prince himself,

07:33.370 --> 07:37.457
did he forget to give you a hug
before he sent you along your way?

07:37.541 --> 07:41.920
Because you can't just let nurses go
on account of feeling insignificant.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.214
And besides, with your money,

07:44.298 --> 07:47.718
you ought to be able to keep a man
tucked away in the closet

07:47.801 --> 07:52.472
and bring him out when you want to
knock him around.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.641
As you were.

07:58.604 --> 08:01.648
Doug, look away.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.568
l can't.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.533
- What are you serving for dinner?
- That's not really my area.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.243
l'd like chicken.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.997
Mr Hoffner,
here's your surgical consult.

08:17.080 --> 08:22.669
But he's gonna agree with the medical
course l set for you. Now, Dr Turk,

08:22.753 --> 08:26.507
tell Mr Hoffner whether or not
you think he should have surgery.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.675
l think he should have surgery.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.803
<i>The important thing
is that we're professionals,</i>

08:31.887 --> 08:35.057
<i>and we should behave as such
in front of the patient.</i>

08:39.227 --> 08:42.272
No! Tell me he did not fire her.

08:42.356 --> 08:46.610
You had to show up Kelso
and now another nurse is out of a job.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.196
- l went to confront...
- Am l done?

08:49.279 --> 08:50.739
You don't look done.

08:50.822 --> 08:54.243
- You know what your problem is?
- l put myself...

08:54.326 --> 08:57.663
Who answers that question?
That is your problem.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.457
You think you have
the answers to everything,

09:00.541 --> 09:05.087
but end up throwing gas on the fire,
and everyone pays the consequences.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.506
That's what l was going to say.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.008
Carla, can l talk to you for a second?

09:10.092 --> 09:12.386
My God, Barbie needs you.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.596
To be continued.

09:19.017 --> 09:23.438
Why hasn't he asked me out? l'm single.
l mentioned five movies l want to see.

09:23.522 --> 09:26.775
l drop things so when l pick them up,
he can see l'm flexible.

09:26.859 --> 09:30.529
Elliot, these things
take time and self-respect.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.531
So we're going to focus on time.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.201
- Nobody likes me when they meet me.
- Exactly!

09:36.285 --> 09:38.579
l'm helping.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.999
- We've got all the time in the world.
- Right.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.586
- No.
- l knew it.

09:45.669 --> 09:49.047
l'm dying.
l was exhausted on that treadmill.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.884
l should have said something.
But l never do.

09:51.967 --> 09:57.055
Not when it comes to my well-being.
And now l'm getting a pig heart.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.349
You're perfect.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.686
You're free to go. Today.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.982
- That seems like good news.
- Best news ever.

10:11.028 --> 10:13.989
Dropped my clipboard.
l'll just...

10:15.115 --> 10:18.952
Do l need to sign something?

10:19.036 --> 10:23.957
- You were going to back me up.
- He's had colitis for ten years.

10:24.041 --> 10:28.128
And no girlfriends.
lt's a gassy disease.

10:28.212 --> 10:33.133
- You can't consider it a reoccurrence.
- He's high risk for colon cancer.

10:33.217 --> 10:36.261
- Give him frequent colonoscopies.
- How frequent?

10:36.345 --> 10:38.805
You're turning this into a competition.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.767
Luckily, it's not up to you.
lt's up to Mr Hoffner.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.393
l'm going with surgery.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.480
- You're getting meat for dinner.
- l eat chicken.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.732
l'll set it up.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.372
- Say it!
- l'm your bitch.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.753
<i>I'm not gonna let Turk beat me.</i>

11:09.837 --> 11:12.589
<i>I'm gonna fight back,
and you want to know how?</i>

11:12.673 --> 11:14.132
<i>I'm telling.</i>

11:14.216 --> 11:16.134
Dr Cox?

11:17.678 --> 11:19.972
He stole my patient.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.308
And then, and then...

11:23.392 --> 11:25.811
lt's OK, Jumbo.

11:25.894 --> 11:29.523
Now, who's my big boy?

11:29.606 --> 11:32.192
- l am!
- You're my big boy!

11:32.276 --> 11:34.611
- You're my big boy.
- l'm your big...

11:34.695 --> 11:39.116
Good God, newbie, do you think
you're the only one with problems here?

11:39.199 --> 11:42.452
Give me a break. Watch this.
Pick a nurse, any nurse.

11:42.536 --> 11:46.081
Laverne, when you get a chance,
could you grab a file for me?

11:46.165 --> 11:48.625
- Grab these.
- Rough all over.

11:48.709 --> 11:52.421
So don't talk to me, Joanie.
Just go talk to your patient.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.006
Go.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.304
- What's up, Benedict?
- What?

12:00.387 --> 12:01.805
Benedict Arnold?

12:01.889 --> 12:06.894
- That's the lamest smack talk.
- That's not what the redcoats thought.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.770
You went colonial on his ass.

12:08.854 --> 12:12.149
So you're gonna go under the knife
just cos he told you to?

12:12.232 --> 12:16.403
- No, l spoke to some other people.
- Like who?

12:16.486 --> 12:19.031
All fixed.

12:19.114 --> 12:23.160
- He's a janitor.
- Yeah, but he seems confident.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.840
What are you gonna do,
take a swing at me?

12:36.924 --> 12:42.554
- Maybe.
- Well, if you do, l'd better die.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.682
Because if l don't,
l will be coming for you.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.101
Good cake today.

12:48.185 --> 12:52.773
You fired a dear, dear friend of mine.
That woman was like family.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.943
- Who?
- l'll tell you who.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.364
Coffee Nurse.

13:00.447 --> 13:04.409
When you fired Coffee Nurse,
you made this whole thing personal.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.119
No, you made it personal.

13:06.203 --> 13:09.206
You gave me lip yesterday
in front of the interns.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.209
You know why l laid off
those first two nurses?

13:12.292 --> 13:17.130
Budgetary constraints forced a cut,
and those two had negative reports.

13:17.214 --> 13:20.801
And you think l did it
to make myself happy.

13:22.261 --> 13:25.556
l wouldn't notice
if they all caught on fire.

13:25.639 --> 13:29.226
Then why in God's name
did you axe Coffee Nurse?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.395
Because you were being an ass.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.773
You're right, that was personal.
My bad.

13:36.942 --> 13:40.112
Golly, l do love moist cake.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.829
Where are you going?
You're not off 'til midnight.

13:48.912 --> 13:52.499
lt's my last chance,
and Sean's only seen me skanked out.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.043
Does it look like l'm trying too hard?

13:55.127 --> 13:57.588
No. Do you need me
to ice up your nipples?

13:57.671 --> 14:01.049
- What would that do?
- Go get him, tiger.

14:07.806 --> 14:12.060
Dr Reid, we need help
with one of your patients.

14:18.150 --> 14:22.654
l'm just a janitor. l don't know much.
But l do know this:

14:22.738 --> 14:24.823
You need surgery.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.617
<i>What?</i>

14:37.503 --> 14:40.088
How's it going?

14:40.172 --> 14:43.133
lt's good. Yeah, it's good.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.260
You have something on your cheek.

14:45.344 --> 14:48.347
Yeah, that's just...

14:49.890 --> 14:52.392
That's poo.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.770
You know what they say, right?

14:54.853 --> 14:57.689
Because everybody poops. l just did.

14:57.773 --> 15:02.027
Earlier. Not this second.
But down there, l pooped.

15:02.110 --> 15:05.405
That is so cool
that you can just talk about it.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.616
Really?

15:07.699 --> 15:10.035
Yeah, l love to poop.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.996
Dr Dorian, present your patient.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.040
Yes, sir.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.626
The patient presented in DKA,

15:17.709 --> 15:20.629
which is why l've started him
on an insulin drip...

15:20.712 --> 15:24.800
Don't bother.
l'm gonna go in for surgery.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.885
Me too.

15:26.969 --> 15:30.222
l'm having surgery right now,
and loving it.

15:30.305 --> 15:33.684
Let's get you out of your skin.

15:33.767 --> 15:37.354
Bob, could l talk to you for a sec?

15:42.860 --> 15:46.488
Can l let my mind wander,
or are we doing something?

15:46.572 --> 15:49.032
l just wanted to say that l'm...

15:50.242 --> 15:53.162
- l'm sorry.
- Holy crap.

15:53.245 --> 15:55.956
My bad behaviour is my own doing.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.084
l don't think a nurse should
suffer on account of it.

15:59.168 --> 16:03.505
- Then l'll make it right...
- Thank you.

16:03.589 --> 16:07.926
...if you will apologise again
so the interns can hear.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.095
Your call, Perry.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.684
Dr Kelso.

16:15.767 --> 16:19.521
l'm sorry. l was wrong.

16:24.359 --> 16:29.698
- Doug, for God's sakes.
- l don't care. lt's beautiful, man.

16:34.786 --> 16:38.373
l cannot believe l talked to Sean
about poo for ten minutes.

16:38.457 --> 16:42.044
- Relax. Nobody knows.
- Hey, Poopie.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.880
At one point,
l tried changing the subject to art.

16:44.963 --> 16:49.426
But we went from art to artists
to alcohol to coffee,

16:49.510 --> 16:52.679
and that just led right back to poo.

16:52.763 --> 16:57.601
You know the saying, ''No one will love
you until you learn to love yourself''?

16:57.684 --> 17:00.395
My mother used to say,
''No one will love you''.

17:00.479 --> 17:04.191
Fake it. Don't let him see
what a neurotic mess you are.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.069
You see Turk over there?

17:07.528 --> 17:13.659
He doesn't know l cry sometimes because
l'm not sure there's a cat heaven.

17:13.742 --> 17:18.747
lt's hiding the crazy and acting like
the most confident girl in the room.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.915
No problem.

17:22.667 --> 17:28.089
<i>I too decided it was time to act
confident and face things head-on.</i>

17:28.173 --> 17:32.135
That was my patient, Turk.
l brought you in as my friend.

17:32.219 --> 17:36.515
You're so competitive, you just
take him from me? That sucks.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.184
- Tough.
- Excuse me?

17:39.268 --> 17:43.397
You're damn right l'm competitive.
That's what makes me a good doctor.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.442
l want to win at everything,
every day, and you should too.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.778
That sounds like a great friendship.

17:49.862 --> 17:55.367
lf you don't want to play ''Steak'', fine.
This has nothing to do with friendship.

17:55.450 --> 18:01.498
You're angry at yourself because you
couldn't get the guy to believe in you.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.585
He never got the concept of the team.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.753
l know.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.715
Have a cookie, man.

18:13.594 --> 18:17.472
- l win at ''Cookie''?
- Yeah.

18:17.556 --> 18:21.602
- Thanks again, sir.
- No matter what the board says,

18:21.685 --> 18:26.190
l'm not going to let someone like you
get away. Not without a fight.

18:27.900 --> 18:32.237
You think she doesn't see through you?
These people know who really cares.

18:32.321 --> 18:36.617
- You and Jennifer are pretty tight?
- Hell, yeah.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.411
Jenny. Gosh, l'm glad you're back.

18:39.495 --> 18:41.580
Thanks. My name's Patti.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.584
Fool.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.842
Sean?

18:59.181 --> 19:01.016
Sean, wait.

19:04.686 --> 19:07.439
- ls that...
- No!

19:07.523 --> 19:11.944
No. This is just muddy water. See?

19:12.027 --> 19:17.157
- You just tasted muddy water.
- l know. That was weird.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.340
You're like, the best doctor ever.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.009
- Why didn't you ask me out?
- Are you kidding?

19:36.093 --> 19:40.222
l was laying there, pants-less,
with crusties in my nose, and l just...

19:40.305 --> 19:42.391
- Ask me out this minute.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:42.474 --> 19:45.018
Do you want to go out with me, Elliot?

19:46.937 --> 19:48.146
Yes.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.942
<i>When most of your time
is spent fighting death and illness,</i>

19:52.025 --> 19:56.697
<i>you look for any victory you can get,
even a victory over your own self-doubt.</i>

19:56.780 --> 19:59.700
- How cool was that?
- OK, cool it.

20:00.826 --> 20:03.704
- l'll check you later.
- Check you later.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.668
l'm OK.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.295
Bye.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.131
You two are perfect for each other.

20:16.091 --> 20:20.053
l got a date. l got a date.

20:21.889 --> 20:27.352
<i>Sometimes your ego leads you
into battles you can't possibly win.</i>

20:32.983 --> 20:37.613
<i>And sometimes you have to admit that
feeling competitive isn't a bad thing.</i>

20:37.696 --> 20:41.325
<i>If you believe you're right,
you have to fight for it.</i>

20:41.408 --> 20:45.829
l know it's the right way to go, and
l am not gonna take no for an answer.

20:45.913 --> 20:48.248
So what do you say?

20:51.710 --> 20:53.378
Let's do it.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.758
You won. Now beat it.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.927
- What?
- Go.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.181
Let's get you some sherbet.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.935
<i>Bottom line, when the stakes are high,
go for the win.</i>

21:08.018 --> 21:10.854
<i>As long as you don't
get caught up in the petty stuff.</i>

21:10.938 --> 21:15.484
Newbie, if we lose to these cutters,
don't bother showing up tomorrow.

21:15.567 --> 21:18.487
l don't want to beat them.
l want to embarrass them.

21:30.374 --> 21:31.875
And go!
