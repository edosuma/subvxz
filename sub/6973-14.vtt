WEBVTT

00:11.678 --> 00:13.976
[Man] AJell-O salad
with little pear chunks.

00:14.047 --> 00:17.608
It's the Wednesday special at the
hospital cafeteria. I can't escape it.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.346
Listen to you. That didn't stop you
from eating my dessert.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.615
Well, all right.
The profiteroles weren't bad.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.817
- [Beeping]
- You didn't want me to starve, did you?

00:25.892 --> 00:27.826
He ate mine too.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.021
Daddy, why don't you take this
before my arm falls off.

00:30.096 --> 00:33.259
Thanks, honey.
[Grunts]

00:33.333 --> 00:35.267
Everybody?

00:35.335 --> 00:38.099
- One last shot.
- Oh, Dad.

00:38.171 --> 00:40.799
Do you think we can draw the line
at 600 photographs?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.206
Six hundred and one.

00:43.276 --> 00:46.336
Quit griping.
And hold up that eyesore, Robert.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.779
God knows when you're
gonna win another one.

00:48.848 --> 00:51.442
Irv, you wanna think
about staying the night?

00:51.518 --> 00:54.078
- It's awful late
to head back to the city.
- Yeah.

00:54.154 --> 00:57.817
What? I get to stay at the home of
the Bay Area Doctor of the Year?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.825
It's a deal.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.863
Proud of you, Robert.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.868
Up. Hold it up.
Say "cheese."

01:12.705 --> 01:15.071
"Presented to
Dr. Robert Wieder M. D...

01:15.141 --> 01:18.042
"for the great wisdom,
skill and compassion...

01:18.111 --> 01:20.409
he exhibits in
the practice of medicine."

01:26.086 --> 01:28.611
It's gonna look awfully nice
in your office.

01:31.691 --> 01:34.057
What are you thinking?

01:34.127 --> 01:36.186
How this is just
the cherry on top.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.365
How lucky I am.

[Beeping]

02:20.573 --> 02:22.837
- What is it?
- Downstairs motion sensor.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.774
You think Dad
tripped the alarm?

02:24.844 --> 02:26.778
The alarm
hasn't been tripped.

02:28.848 --> 02:31.373
You got me.
I'll go check it out.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.227
Irv?

02:46.666 --> 02:49.260
Irving,
is everything all right?

04:16.687 --> 04:18.745
What do you think, Scully?
Is this a name, possibly,

04:18.822 --> 04:20.950
or a code or an anagram?

04:21.024 --> 04:23.016
T-H-E-E-F.

04:23.094 --> 04:26.325
I assume it's supposed to be
T-H-l-E-F. Thief.

04:26.397 --> 04:29.230
Insert your own
Dan Quayle joke here.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.133
Lousy spelling aside, what do you think
it refers to? Who's the thief?

04:32.203 --> 04:34.194
[Scully]
Well, that's certainly one question.

04:34.272 --> 04:36.137
I've got many.

04:36.207 --> 04:38.675
"Mulder,
why are we here?"

04:38.743 --> 04:41.906
Mmm, to be fair,
I might have used the words,

04:41.979 --> 04:44.311
"Mulder,
how is this an X-File?"

04:44.382 --> 04:47.681
You see that, Scully?
You always keep me guessing.

04:47.752 --> 04:52.587
This is Dr. Irving Thalbro, age 66,
found hanged with his throat cut,

04:52.657 --> 04:55.023
his family tucked away and
in bed not 40 feet from here.

04:55.093 --> 04:57.027
Didn't see or hear anything.

04:57.095 --> 05:00.121
Which would certainly shine
the light of suspicion on them.

05:00.198 --> 05:02.098
Except they're the ones
that called it in,

05:02.166 --> 05:04.896
and there's no evidence whatsoever
to link them to the crime.

05:04.969 --> 05:07.164
Which is why the police
are rightly wondering...

05:07.238 --> 05:09.570
if Dr. Thalbro
killed himself.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.767
Except who, then, did this?

05:11.843 --> 05:14.573
Blood pattern doesn't indicate
that the good doctor did it,

05:14.645 --> 05:17.512
who I am assuming could read and write
above a fourth grade level.

05:17.582 --> 05:21.074
I'll admit, Mulder, this is not
an open-and-shut case.

05:21.152 --> 05:23.848
But, uh, it doesn't
make it an X-File.

05:23.921 --> 05:25.855
Well, there is
one detail that does.

05:30.461 --> 05:32.520
This.

05:32.597 --> 05:34.224
Dirt?

05:34.298 --> 05:38.234
Dirt. It's a very powerful
component of hexcraft,

05:38.302 --> 05:40.702
as well as the pattern in which
it was originally arranged.

05:40.771 --> 05:42.705
Check this out.

05:45.176 --> 05:48.339
- Looks like a human form.
- [Sighs]

05:48.412 --> 05:52.439
Hexcraft, as in putting
a curse on someone?

05:52.517 --> 05:54.610
Murdering them magically?

05:54.685 --> 05:58.314
That's what it looks like to me. Now,
I know what you're gonna say, Scully.

05:58.389 --> 06:02.120
No, hexcraft. I mean,
I'll buy that as the intent here.

06:02.193 --> 06:03.956
It certainly jives
with the evidence.

06:04.028 --> 06:06.690
I say we talk
to the family.

06:12.436 --> 06:14.631
I'll always
keep you guessing.

06:17.975 --> 06:20.443
It was probably
the greatest night of my life.

06:20.511 --> 06:22.445
Till...

06:24.315 --> 06:27.409
Sir, can you think of any enemies
your father-in-law might have made?

06:27.485 --> 06:30.249
Maybe inadvertently through
his medical practice...

06:30.321 --> 06:32.846
or a business dealing,
perhaps?

06:32.924 --> 06:35.119
Everybody loved Irving.

06:35.193 --> 06:37.753
Everyone who knew him.
He was...

06:40.998 --> 06:43.159
No, I can't conceive of it.

06:43.234 --> 06:45.327
Dr. Wieder,
do you have any enemies?

06:47.104 --> 06:49.902
I'm sorry I have to ask.
There was a message left behind.

06:49.974 --> 06:52.340
If it doesn't refer to your
father-in-law, it may refer to you.

06:52.410 --> 06:55.004
[Girl]
Thief?

06:55.079 --> 06:57.604
Are you asking
if my dad's a thief?

06:59.417 --> 07:03.513
He saves people's lives.
He's a good man.

07:03.588 --> 07:05.522
Honey.

07:07.758 --> 07:11.854
If I have any enemies,
I don't know them.

07:17.835 --> 07:20.463
At the home of his son-in-law,
Dr. Robert Wieder,

07:20.538 --> 07:24.531
Dr. Irving Thalbro was found
hanged at 1:48 this morning.

07:24.609 --> 07:27.237
The details are sketchy.
It's my understanding...

07:27.311 --> 07:30.542
that police are treating
the case as a murder.

07:30.615 --> 07:34.210
This is due in part to
core evidence left at the scene.

07:34.285 --> 07:36.219
[TVContinues,
Indistinct]

07:45.363 --> 07:47.490
[Sniffing]

08:00.678 --> 08:04.580
Hello? Mr. Peattie?

08:04.649 --> 08:07.675
Mr. Peattie,
I know you're in there.

08:07.752 --> 08:10.016
Are you cooking?

08:10.087 --> 08:12.021
You aren't
supposed to be cooking.

08:19.397 --> 08:22.696
You aren't supposed
to be cooking.

08:22.767 --> 08:25.827
That smell like somethin'
you wanna eat?

08:25.903 --> 08:29.771
- Well, what is it, then?
- Medicine.

08:31.409 --> 08:33.707
Oh, all right.
Uh,

08:33.778 --> 08:36.178
just so long
as you're not cooking.

08:37.648 --> 08:41.607
Seems like you could use yourself
a poultice for your back.

08:43.254 --> 08:45.188
Old Peattie fix ya right up.

08:45.256 --> 08:47.190
Be ready later.

09:00.738 --> 09:03.605
[Chanting, Indistinct]

09:47.318 --> 09:51.254
- Scully. This dirt we found?
Gas pneumatograph shows...
- Mm-hmm.

09:51.322 --> 09:54.086
Pronounced spikes of methane
and sulfur compounds.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.092
The signature of decay.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.288
It's graveyard dirt,
also known as conjure dust.

09:59.363 --> 10:02.924
It's one of the most powerful hexing
elements, whether for good or evil.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.934
Not the kind of stuff you want
to be on the wrong end of.

10:05.002 --> 10:06.697
Uh-huh.

10:06.771 --> 10:10.138
Well, go ahead, Scully.
Keep me guessing.

10:10.207 --> 10:12.038
Kuru.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.112
The-The, uh...

10:16.180 --> 10:18.114
The disease that
New Guinea tribesmen get?

10:18.182 --> 10:20.673
From eating the brains
of their relatives.

10:20.751 --> 10:24.050
I thought my grandpa
slurping his soup was bad.

10:24.121 --> 10:26.681
Practically speaking, Mulder,
Kuru doesn't even exist anymore,

10:26.757 --> 10:29.385
not in New Guinea
and certainly not in the U.S.

10:29.460 --> 10:32.759
But this man's cerebellum
and his triadim...

10:32.830 --> 10:35.697
clearly show signs of it,
Mulder.

10:35.766 --> 10:38.394
I mean, these plaques...
his brain is riddled with them.

10:38.469 --> 10:40.869
Kuru makes you crazy, right?

10:40.938 --> 10:43.463
Yeah, stark-raving, among other things.
But in this case,

10:43.541 --> 10:47.773
stark-raving mad enough to
slit his own throat and hang himself.

10:47.845 --> 10:50.143
Mulder, that's what
his autopsy shows...

10:50.214 --> 10:52.409
from the wound pattern
to-to the blood spray.

10:52.483 --> 10:55.748
- This man did it to himself.
There's no question.
- Unless...

10:56.821 --> 10:58.755
it was inflicted upon him.

10:58.823 --> 11:00.757
The graveyard dirt, the hex.

11:00.825 --> 11:03.885
He was given this disease
so that he would kill himself.

11:28.619 --> 11:31.383
Nan? Honey?

11:39.129 --> 11:41.188
Robert?

11:41.265 --> 11:43.199
Look at this.

11:55.746 --> 11:58.306
It could be
they needed it as evidence.

12:07.622 --> 12:09.988
[Chattering Continues]

12:22.337 --> 12:25.738
I'm telling you,
I'm scared.

12:25.807 --> 12:28.901
I can't stay here, Robert.
I can't live in this house anymore.

12:28.977 --> 12:32.003
Lucy can't, not after
what's happened here.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.014
And now this picture of us
is missing.

12:34.082 --> 12:36.880
- It'll turn up.
- No. It doesn't make any sense.

12:36.951 --> 12:38.646
Nothing that's happened here
makes any sense.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.847
It does.
Nan,

12:42.824 --> 12:45.349
listen to me.

12:45.427 --> 12:47.918
Your dad was ill.

12:47.996 --> 12:50.328
He had a kind of
progressive dementia.

12:50.398 --> 12:52.696
That's what
the F.B.I. Autopsy showed.

12:52.767 --> 12:55.361
I reviewed their findings,
and I have to agree.

12:56.571 --> 12:59.972
Honey,
we will get through this.

13:19.694 --> 13:23.357
- Oh, my God! Nan, honey!
- [Groaning]

13:27.268 --> 13:29.896
Oh, my God!

13:29.971 --> 13:32.166
- Nan!
- Dad?

13:32.240 --> 13:34.731
Lucy, call 911.

13:36.311 --> 13:38.575
Call 911!

13:38.646 --> 13:40.739
Nan!

13:40.815 --> 13:43.010
[Chanting, Indistinct]

13:59.367 --> 14:01.426
[Beeping]

14:11.880 --> 14:14.440
Dr. Wieder?

14:21.656 --> 14:24.420
We understand
you've made a diagnosis.

14:26.461 --> 14:30.056
Diffuse Cutaneous Flesh Moniliasis.
Old World type.

14:31.766 --> 14:35.258
- I take it that's rare.
- In San Francisco? It's unheard of.

14:35.336 --> 14:38.430
Maybe in Central Africa.

14:38.506 --> 14:41.407
- Well, the rarer, the better.
- What do you mean by that?

14:41.476 --> 14:44.240
Someone directed this
to happen to your wife...

14:44.312 --> 14:46.906
just as someone directed
what happened to your father-in-law.

14:46.981 --> 14:50.747
My enemy you were talking about...
the one who thinks I'm a thief?

14:54.022 --> 14:56.217
Agent, you're a doctor.
Explain to your partner...

14:56.291 --> 14:59.124
that no one can direct
a person to get sick.

14:59.194 --> 15:01.924
The dirt you found in your bed
drawn in the shape of a body,

15:01.996 --> 15:04.556
that's indicative of
folk magic.

15:04.632 --> 15:06.600
That's what I believe
is being used against you.

15:07.669 --> 15:10.160
Folk magic?

15:10.238 --> 15:13.969
You mean, like, Babayaga?
Gypsies?

15:14.042 --> 15:16.806
I was actually thinking
less Eastern and more Celtic.

15:16.878 --> 15:19.813
Maybe Scots-Irish
or Appalachian, even.

15:19.881 --> 15:22.372
I'm supposed to
take this seriously?

15:22.450 --> 15:25.613
Sir, regardless
of the particulars,

15:25.687 --> 15:28.622
I think it's clear that
there was an intruder in your home.

15:28.690 --> 15:31.022
And I think it would be
prudent for you...

15:31.092 --> 15:33.856
to accept our protection...

15:33.928 --> 15:36.226
and help us to identify
this person.

15:36.297 --> 15:40.199
Prudent for me would be to
continue treating my wife.

15:40.268 --> 15:43.669
If we don't stop who's causing this,
your treatments won't matter.

15:43.738 --> 15:48.072
So modern medicine
and all it encompasses...

15:48.142 --> 15:51.976
artificial hearts, laser surgery,
gene therapy, to name a few...

15:52.046 --> 15:54.742
all of that arrayed against
a pile of magic dirt?

15:56.451 --> 15:59.352
And you tell me I'll lose.

16:04.425 --> 16:06.359
I have M.R.I. S to look at.

16:09.964 --> 16:11.898
Oh, yeah, Mulder,
win him over.

16:11.966 --> 16:15.458
He will lose unless
we can find a way to stop it.

16:15.536 --> 16:17.470
What do you suggest?

16:18.706 --> 16:20.640
A second opinion.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.588
[Chuckling]

16:41.663 --> 16:45.622
The truth always hurts,
don't it, Doc?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.429
Who are you?

16:52.740 --> 16:55.368
Is this you?
You did this?

16:59.013 --> 17:00.947
What do you want from me?

17:01.015 --> 17:04.576
Don't you be frettin' none
about that.

17:04.652 --> 17:06.676
I'm gettin'
my nickel's worth.

17:06.753 --> 17:09.279
You're doin'
a fine job so far.

17:09.357 --> 17:12.053
What the hell are you talking about?
What is this all about?

17:12.126 --> 17:14.424
Lynette Peattie.

17:16.698 --> 17:19.531
And don't you be sayin'
you don't recollect her.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.467
Uh-uh.
No, no, no.

17:22.537 --> 17:25.994
Look, if I've done anything
to upset you, l...

17:28.643 --> 17:32.511
It's no use trying to intimidate me
if I don't know how I've offended you!

17:34.649 --> 17:36.810
Tell me!

17:36.884 --> 17:38.818
What makes me a thief?

17:43.624 --> 17:46.457
You be a smart man.

17:46.527 --> 17:48.961
I figure...

17:49.030 --> 17:53.330
you ponder it a while,
it gonna come to ya.

17:59.574 --> 18:01.508
Wait!

18:08.182 --> 18:10.173
[Keyboard Clacking]

18:13.354 --> 18:16.482
[Sighs] No. No matter how I spell it,
there's no Lynette Peattie.

18:18.126 --> 18:21.562
- She's not in my patient file.
- She's not in any doctor's patient file.

18:21.629 --> 18:24.325
No one by that name has ever
been admitted to the hospital.

a little more.

Good afternoon.

21:32.886 --> 21:36.583
Yeah, we're looking for some
alternative medical advice.

21:37.991 --> 21:40.152
Well, you've come
to the right place.

21:40.226 --> 21:43.423
I get a lot of folks
fed up with their H.M.O.s.

21:43.496 --> 21:46.659
- Well, actually, we're not here for us.
- Yeah.

21:46.733 --> 21:49.861
Oh! Chief,
back in your pocket.

21:49.936 --> 21:52.029
It's dirt.

21:52.105 --> 21:54.039
It's goofer dust
is what it is.

21:54.107 --> 21:56.541
I don't know what your
intentions are with that.

21:56.609 --> 21:59.339
- Goofer dust?
- Conjure dust, goofer dust.

21:59.412 --> 22:01.778
How would you go about
making somebody sick using that?

22:03.950 --> 22:06.612
We're investigating a murder.
That's why I'm asking.

22:06.686 --> 22:08.620
Oh.

22:08.688 --> 22:11.384
Speaking strictly
in the academic sense,

22:11.458 --> 22:15.087
you'd spread it on or near
your victim to direct misfortune.

22:15.161 --> 22:18.562
So you could give them
any illness you wanted...

22:18.631 --> 22:22.032
- one that you chose
specifically for them?
- Oh...

22:22.102 --> 22:24.764
that's a lot trickier.

22:24.838 --> 22:27.204
It requires
something special.

22:31.378 --> 22:35.610
- A voodoo doll.
- No. They're called "puppets."

22:35.682 --> 22:39.482
Inside, you place three thorns
of a blood red rose,

22:39.552 --> 22:42.783
a strand of hair,
and a photo of your victim.

22:42.856 --> 22:45.324
Maybe other items as well.
Depends on the operator.

22:45.392 --> 22:47.986
Sew it up, say your spell.

22:48.061 --> 22:50.325
How would you counteract
one of these?

22:50.397 --> 22:52.558
Depends on who
you're dealing with.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.896
But if the person
you're looking for...

22:54.968 --> 22:59.064
is powerful enough to bring about
a murder, he's probably charmed.

22:59.139 --> 23:01.266
Which would mean what?

23:01.341 --> 23:03.502
It means just that.

23:03.576 --> 23:05.976
He's drawing on
the energy of a charm.

23:06.045 --> 23:08.411
A source of magic power.

23:08.481 --> 23:10.847
It could be any item,

23:10.917 --> 23:14.114
provided that
it's very important to him.

23:14.187 --> 23:16.121
Something that holds
great meaning for him.

23:16.189 --> 23:20.285
And unless you can separate him
from his charm,

23:20.360 --> 23:22.294
you're out of luck.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.644
Poppin' corn.

23:43.616 --> 23:45.550
You gotta put
the money in first.

Don't look like
no poppin' corn to me.

Put it in the microwave.
Then you get your popcorn.

your wife was murdered?

27:30.810 --> 27:35.076
It was no accident. There was
no malfunction of the machine.

27:35.147 --> 27:37.081
Yes, I believe
she was murdered.

27:37.149 --> 27:39.583
And you still have
no idea why?

branded into your wife's chest.

to see me yesterday.

My age, older, maybe.

28:11.684 --> 28:14.346
Tall.

28:14.420 --> 28:17.150
He mentioned someone named
Lynette Peattie.

28:17.223 --> 28:20.488
I didn't know
who she was at first.

28:20.559 --> 28:23.722
Turns out she was a Jane Doe
I treated last October.

28:25.698 --> 28:30.431
She was in a bus rollover.
Came in amid a wave of victims.

28:31.737 --> 28:33.967
She was the worst off.

28:34.039 --> 28:37.873
I could barely put fluids in fast enough
to keep up with the blood loss.

28:40.512 --> 28:43.572
We were rushing around
triaging people.

28:45.084 --> 28:47.882
Everybody knew
she was dying.

28:47.953 --> 28:50.387
It was only a matter of time.

28:52.458 --> 28:54.392
She was in agony.

29:12.711 --> 29:15.805
This was
my course of treatment.

29:15.881 --> 29:18.543
[Scully]
You gave her morphine.

29:18.617 --> 29:20.847
Lots of it.

29:21.987 --> 29:23.921
I pushed it myself.

29:28.027 --> 29:31.019
She kept screaming,

29:31.096 --> 29:33.189
and her heart rate
kept climbing.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.693
So...

29:36.769 --> 29:38.703
I kept pushing.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.638
I took maybe the last
20 minutes of her life.

29:50.783 --> 29:52.717
It was a fair trade to make
for the pain.

29:55.587 --> 29:57.282
Her father doesn't agree.

29:59.158 --> 30:01.456
What makes you think
it's her father?

30:01.527 --> 30:04.690
He thinks you robbed him
of his family.

30:04.763 --> 30:07.425
And that's why he's systematically
robbing you of yours.

[Scully] If Lynette Peattie
was Carlos theJackal,

30:33.359 --> 30:36.089
I would've had an easier time
tracking her down.

30:36.161 --> 30:39.289
There's no birth certificate,
no social security number, nothing.

30:39.365 --> 30:42.493
Better known to the world
as Jane Doe, 6149.

30:42.568 --> 30:45.298
Well, her name shows up
once in the records...

30:45.371 --> 30:49.102
of a Vista Inoculation Program
in 1981.

30:49.174 --> 30:52.871
- The Allegheny Mountains
of West Virginia.
- Deepest Appalachia.

30:52.945 --> 30:55.038
That's when her father,
one Oral Peattie,

30:55.114 --> 30:58.049
refused to allow her to be
inoculated against polio.

30:58.117 --> 31:02.349
But there's no address for him.
There's no record of him whatsoever.

31:05.190 --> 31:08.159
Mulder, why are we
exhuming this girl?

31:09.661 --> 31:11.993
Well, I'm thinking of her
dear old backwoods dad...

31:12.064 --> 31:13.998
and where he gets
all his graveyard dirt.

31:15.167 --> 31:18.534
Here?
His daughter's grave?

31:18.604 --> 31:20.697
The occultist we spoke to
said that the person...

31:20.773 --> 31:23.606
casting these magic spells
was charmed.

31:23.675 --> 31:26.143
That he had a source of power
that was very meaningful to him...

31:26.211 --> 31:28.679
and he kept it close by.

31:28.747 --> 31:30.681
Lynette Peattie's body?

31:30.749 --> 31:32.683
That's my guess.

31:32.751 --> 31:36.448
So as long as her body remains here
resting in peace in the Bay Area,

31:36.522 --> 31:38.456
he remains powerful.

We rented a cabin for you. It's
important that you get out of town.

And you believe by our leaving
it will somehow weaken him?

33:17.890 --> 33:20.552
Well, what's important
is that he believes that.

33:20.626 --> 33:23.356
At any rate, if he can't fnd you,
he can't hurt you.

33:23.428 --> 33:25.658

he'll come forward?

40:54.345 --> 40:56.176
[Sobbing]
Daddy!

41:00.184 --> 41:03.244
Stop! Daddy!

41:03.321 --> 41:06.586
- Daddy!
- [Gunshot]

41:22.273 --> 41:24.764
[Sobbing]
Daddy.

41:45.763 --> 41:47.788
[Monitor Beeping]

41:54.038 --> 41:57.997
Lynette Peattie's body is on its way
back home to O'Neal, West Virginia.

42:00.611 --> 42:03.136
She's going back
to her people after all.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.882
You know, Mulder,
I would have made the same call.

42:14.525 --> 42:17.221
As a doctor,

42:17.295 --> 42:19.354
if I was certain that
I couldn't save her life...

42:19.430 --> 42:22.399
and she was in
that much pain,

42:22.467 --> 42:25.231
- I would've done what Wieder did.
- Mm-hmm.

42:25.303 --> 42:27.567
It seems
pretty clear cut.

42:27.638 --> 42:30.732
Except maybe it's not.

42:32.977 --> 42:35.912
You're wondering if maybe
Peattie could've saved her life?

42:53.431 --> 42:55.365
You do keep me guessing.

43:55.493 --> 43:58.429
[Child]
I made this!

43:59.305 --> 44:05.824
