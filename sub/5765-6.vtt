00:00.860 --> 00:02.999
Previously on The Good Wife:

00:03.800 --> 00:04.789
I understand the need

00:04.830 --> 00:06.468
to blame someone
for your husband's downfall,

00:06.500 --> 00:07.637
but I didn't release

00:07.670 --> 00:09.069
that sex tape to hurt you

00:09.110 --> 00:10.702
or your family.
You should know,

00:10.740 --> 00:12.674
I was holding back.
Mr. Childs,

00:12.710 --> 00:15.133
if you have something
to show me, just do it.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.374
Did you bury something?

00:16.410 --> 00:18.105
We all know what's
gorng on here.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.674
Peter Florrick was a
corrupt and conVIcted

00:19.720 --> 00:21.039
state's attorney.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.048
If evidence was buried,
he buried it.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.547
Alicia, I know
this has been hard on you,

00:25.590 --> 00:29.014
but you have to believe me,
I'm innocent.

00:33.830 --> 00:35.752
Everybody shut up,
and don't move!

00:38.800 --> 00:39.835
(grunts)

00:39.870 --> 00:41.565
What you staring at?

00:41.600 --> 00:42.806
Get down! Kiss the floor!

00:50.210 --> 00:51.746
Chicago P.D.!

00:51.780 --> 00:53.418
Don't move!

00:54.750 --> 00:56.342
(grunts)

00:57.420 --> 00:59.081
Don't look at
me! Get down!

01:04.530 --> 01:06.748
(gasping)

01:09.430 --> 01:11.091
Oh, come on. Talk
about undue publicity.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.836
You're telling me that
didn't affect the jury pool?

01:12.870 --> 01:14.838
No. I'm telling you
it doesn't matter.

01:14.870 --> 01:15.791
We don't have the time.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.364
We have got...

01:17.410 --> 01:18.729
55 minutes

01:18.770 --> 01:20.829
to get the brief to the
county clerk. We're late,

01:20.880 --> 01:22.347
Clarence Wilcox stays
on death row.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.506
We can't risk it.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.505
We can't not risk it.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.279
The undue publicity
argument is the weakest

01:26.320 --> 01:27.844
part of the brief.
It needs more work.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.869
Which would be a problem

01:28.920 --> 01:30.785
if it was the only part
of the brief.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.549
We've got five other
solid arguments in there

01:32.590 --> 01:34.114
to appeal Wilcox's
conviction.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.650
Let's ask Will.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.659
He'll agree with me.

01:38.690 --> 01:39.429
Good, then it'll be settled.

01:39.460 --> 01:40.791
If it doesn't end up
in the brief,

01:40.830 --> 01:42.627
_ Will can't use it
In oral argument, right?

01:44.700 --> 01:45.598
(sighs)

01:45.630 --> 01:48.098
This... this is crazy.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.664
There's no time to write it.

01:53.410 --> 01:55.401
It'll mean open heart surgery

01:55.440 --> 01:56.600
on the brief!

01:56.650 --> 01:57.776
This is odd.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.677
Yeah, we can
compete tomorrow.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.813
We think there's enough time
to add another argument

02:02.850 --> 02:05.489
to the Legal Aid appeal,
but we have to move quickly.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.317
Quickly seems
to be an understatement.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.282
What time's
the cutoff?
5:00 pm.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.922
There was a cable
TV movie broadcasted

02:10.960 --> 02:12.325
a week before jury selection.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.793
We believe
it influenced the jury.

02:13.830 --> 02:15.252
Why didn't Legal
Aid pursue it?

02:15.300 --> 02:16.426
We don't know.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.869
We found it
two hours ago.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.834
Can you do it
in 48 minutes?
Just.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.238
You're the faster typist.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.830
We need to get the cable
viewership for Cook County.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.279
All right, I'm on it.

02:29.310 --> 02:30.902
MAN:
Undue publicity argument...

02:30.950 --> 02:33.475
WOMAN:
We're never gonna shove all
this in before the deadline.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.839
Which one?

02:34.880 --> 02:36.279
(overlapping chatter)

02:36.320 --> 02:38.311
I got cable viewership
from six years ago.

02:38.350 --> 02:40.352
Give me the numbers.
It's not broken
out by program.

02:40.390 --> 02:41.311
What?!

02:41.360 --> 02:44.284
(overlapping chatter)

02:44.330 --> 02:45.752
We're not going to make it.

02:45.790 --> 02:46.859
Damn.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.629
Damn? Don't say damn.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.719
Shh!
This is gonna
take an hour.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.431
Go ask upstairs,
ask him if he needs it.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.439
Give me a section.

02:57.470 --> 02:58.562
(knocks)

02:58.610 --> 02:59.338
Yeah?

02:59.380 --> 03:00.574
We're almost done

03:00.610 --> 03:01.872
with the TV movie argument,
but we can't specify

03:01.910 --> 03:03.446
the saturation
of the jury pool.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.742
You don't have the ratings
broken out?

03:04.780 --> 03:06.213
No.
Okay.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.445
We'll slip it into
a friend of the court brief.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.879
Just submit what
you have now.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.252
Yup.

03:12.290 --> 03:14.554
Legal Aid couldn't
handle the appeal.

03:14.590 --> 03:17.252
They gave it to us a week
before oral arguments.

03:17.290 --> 03:18.518
Interesting?

03:18.560 --> 03:20.289
Clarence Wilcox.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.890
Apparently killed an off-duty
cop in a grocery store.

03:22.930 --> 03:25.228
He's been _on death row
for srx years.

03:25.270 --> 03:26.897
Legal Aid thinks
he got an unfair trial.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.238
But you know what the appellate
courts think of technicals.

03:29.270 --> 03:30.806
They'll kill it?
Oh, yeah.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.864
_ BREE: _
Give me a section.

03:31.910 --> 03:34.538
(overlapping, excited chatter)

03:34.580 --> 03:35.604
WOMAN:
Finished pages,
hand them over now.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.743
You organize.

03:36.780 --> 03:39.419
Don't give them to me.
Hand them to him.

03:39.450 --> 03:40.474
Okay.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.373
There's a typo there.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.240
No, no, no.
Shut up.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.439
There.
Shut up.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.924
Yeah, this is Cary Agos
at Stern, Lockhart & Gardner.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.589
We have a death row appeal
coming to you... now.

03:55.630 --> 03:57.564
Yeah, well, if you don't mind,
I'd like to stay on the line

03:57.600 --> 03:58.396
and make sure
you receive It.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.931
Damn! WiFi's low!

03:59.970 --> 04:01.892
Come on.

04:01.940 --> 04:02.702
Come on...

04:03.940 --> 04:05.305
Come on.
You're sure?

04:05.340 --> 04:07.638
You don't see it?

04:12.010 --> 04:14.342
Okay, good to know.
Thank you very much.

04:14.380 --> 04:17.508
(laughter and cheering)

04:21.360 --> 04:24.284
MAN:
People of the State of Illinois

04:24.330 --> 04:25.922
v. Clarence Wilcox.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.997
Mr. Gardener,
we've read your brief,

04:29.030 --> 04:30.964
and we're now prepared
for oral arguments.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.297
You may begin.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.989
Thank you, Chief Justice.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.393
May it please the court.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.998
Six years ago,

04:37.040 --> 04:39.929
Clarence Wilcox,
a 24-year-old

04:39.980 --> 04:42.301
Chicago man, was arrested
for the murder

04:42.350 --> 04:44.079
of a plainclothes officer

04:44.110 --> 04:46.442
during the robbery of a
grocery store in South Chicago.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.074
It is our contention that

04:49.120 --> 04:51.884
_ Clarenc_e Wilcox _
did not receive a fair trial.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.889
He has spent the last six years
on death row due to the fact...

04:54.920 --> 04:57.582
Mr. Gardener, please explain
your undue publicity arguments.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.528
Yes, Your Honor.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.357
It is our contention
that Clarence Wilcox...

05:00.400 --> 05:02.618
How is it different
from the Scott Peterson appeal?

05:02.670 --> 05:04.023
It also involved

05:04.070 --> 05:06.459
a TV movie released prior
to jury selection.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.338
Yes, well, Your Honor,

05:10.370 --> 05:11.735
in that case,

05:11.770 --> 05:14.933
the TV movie didn't show
the Peterson character

05:14.980 --> 05:15.969
murdering his victim.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.375
In Cop Killer,

05:17.410 --> 05:18.968
our client is seen

05:19.010 --> 05:21.843
shooï¬‚ng
the victim.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.381
Thank you,
Mr. Gardener.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.428
Yeah.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.429
That was a nice last-minute
Hail Mary with the TV movie.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.961
Judges love novelty
in arguments.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.903
Let's see what
I can find out,

05:42.940 --> 05:43.929
but don't get
your hopes up.

05:43.970 --> 05:47.406
95% of automatic appeals
are rejected out of hand.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.839
Right.
Good job.

05:52.850 --> 05:54.408
WOMAN:
Excuse me, Miss?

05:54.450 --> 05:57.783
Uh, sorry to bother you, but
my name is Patrice Wilcox.

05:59.050 --> 06:01.052
I'm Clarence's wife.

06:01.090 --> 06:02.978
Oh, of course.
I'm so sorry.

06:03.030 --> 06:03.985
I'm Alicia Florrick.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.590
Do you know why Clarence
wasn't in court today?

06:06.630 --> 06:08.598
Why?

06:08.630 --> 06:10.518
Well, during
automatic appeal,

06:10.570 --> 06:12.629
the defendant's
not usually seated.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.160
Didn't someone tell you?

06:14.200 --> 06:16.031
So you're

06:16.070 --> 06:17.059
his new lavwers then?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.839
No.

06:18.870 --> 06:21.577
Legal Aid didn't have the staff
to argue the appeal, so we're

06:21.610 --> 06:22.872
on temporarily.

06:22.910 --> 06:25.049
Because you never said anything
about Clarence being innocent.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.915
Yes. Unfortunately, that wasn't
the point of this appeal.

06:29.950 --> 06:33.056
It was whether some mistake
was made in the law.

06:33.090 --> 06:37.129
Isn't it a mistake in the law
if he didn't do it?

06:37.160 --> 06:40.391
If he was with
me that night?

06:41.230 --> 06:43.460
Have you ever even met him?

06:45.500 --> 06:47.832
And you're arguing for his life.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.899
I want you
to have this.

06:57.980 --> 07:00.141
That's the last time
he held his daughter.

07:12.630 --> 07:13.927
We lost the appeal.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.450
What?

07:15.500 --> 07:16.489
When? How do you know?

07:16.530 --> 07:17.667
The Chief Justice's clerk.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.463
He sets up time
for writing opinions.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.694
It was an easy no.

07:20.740 --> 07:21.866
I thought we had it.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.458
To be honest, I did, too.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.659
So, what do we do now?

07:24.710 --> 07:25.836
Go back to the office.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.030
Well, about the case.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.172
The case?
It's not ours.

07:28.210 --> 07:30.178
It's Legal Aid's.

07:34.920 --> 07:38.879
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

07:50.270 --> 07:52.488
Actual innocence?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.189
Yes.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.935
We lost the
automatic appeal.

07:55.970 --> 07:58.131
Now you want to appeal
on actual innocence?

07:58.170 --> 07:59.068
I read the trial record.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.533
Defense never put his
wife on the stand.

08:01.580 --> 08:04.606
She was his only alibi, and
the jury never heard from her.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.049
Because wives lie.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.219
I can't believe I'm
having to tell you this.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.138
And she had priors.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.612
I read the trial
record, too.

08:11.650 --> 08:12.787
Juvenile priors.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.287
Oh, well, then,
those don't count.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.686
What am I missing here?

08:16.730 --> 08:19.722
When I worked at the
state's attorney's office,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.728
we called these
"appeals by hunch."

08:21.760 --> 08:23.159
This guy had his trial,

08:23.200 --> 08:24.667
an expensive trial.

08:24.700 --> 08:25.894
He killed a cop.

08:25.930 --> 08:27.534
Allegedly.
No.

08:27.570 --> 08:28.559
12 jurors,

08:28.600 --> 08:30.261
strong and true,
found him guilty.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.561
That means not allegedly.

08:31.610 --> 08:32.929
That means he killed a cop.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.005
You know, sometimes

08:35.040 --> 08:37.747
people with cute daughters
and sweet little wives

08:37.780 --> 08:39.179
do bad things.

08:39.210 --> 08:41.678
Sometimes very bad things.

08:42.890 --> 08:46.018
I'm not helping you on this one.

08:48.790 --> 08:50.587
Suit yourself.

09:05.340 --> 09:07.979
Cary wants to take a week
on Clarence Wilcox.

09:08.010 --> 09:10.672
See if there's any
foundation for an
evidentiary appeal.

09:10.710 --> 09:11.745
On actual innocence.

09:11.780 --> 09:12.747
WILL:
We think

09:12.780 --> 09:13.474
it's a good idea
for a week.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.669
DIANE: It's good
promotable work.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.675
And, not to sound
too cynical,

09:15.720 --> 09:16.687
but it burns
off the hours

09:16.720 --> 09:18.688
we owe the pro
bono consortium.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.914
WILL: So you two
up to doing this?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.609
You did a good job
on the Wilcox brief.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.185
Bree sings your
praises as a team.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.356
Sure.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.893
Why not?

09:30.870 --> 09:32.633
What? It's a good cause.

09:32.670 --> 09:35.195
I'm just trying to fit this
into the fuller Cary picture.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.333
Hey, there aren't that
many generations left.

09:37.370 --> 09:39.634
You've taken the greatest
generation, the lost generation,

09:39.680 --> 09:41.807
the Pepsi generation,
so what do we have left?

09:41.840 --> 09:43.740
The surprise generation?

09:43.780 --> 09:45.077
So, surprise.

09:45.110 --> 09:47.772
No. Look,
the truth is,

09:47.820 --> 09:50.618
his wife came up to me
Yesterday with his daughter--

09:50.650 --> 09:53.915
--really cute, you
know-- and gave me this.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.609
(laughs)

09:55.660 --> 09:57.651
What?_It meant
something to me.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.252
Oh, wow.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.222
You think she has a car
full of them?

10:02.260 --> 10:03.818
Hey, it worked.
We're on it.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.690
I'm kind of liking
her more now.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.890
Hmm.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.378
Oh, Mrs. Florrick,

10:13.410 --> 10:14.934
thank you so much
for doing this.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.072
Thank you.

10:19.180 --> 10:22.069
Would you have pursued it
ifI hadn't given you pictures?

10:22.120 --> 10:23.712
That's what I said.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.638
What, do you hand these out
like party favors?

10:25.690 --> 10:28.352
Lawyers tend to
forget he's a person.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.827
Look, I love my husband.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.191
He's innocent,
and I know

10:34.230 --> 10:36.619
he's innocent,
and I would do anything for him.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.194
Anything.

10:38.230 --> 10:40.130
Patrice, how are you doing?
Good.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.762
I just wanted to introduce you.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.937
Josh Baldwin.

10:42.970 --> 10:44.164
Hey. Cary Agos.
Nice to meet you.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.268
Alicia Florrick.

10:45.310 --> 10:46.868
Follow me.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.798
Now, I thought
we had a good defense.

10:48.840 --> 10:49.807
We could have won.
CARY:
Except?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.102
Except it was me against
about a half-dozen ASAs.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.174
This was the first case

10:53.220 --> 10:55.415
in that high-profile task force
your husband set up.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.680
They only handled four
or five cases a year,

10:57.720 --> 10:59.312
but they put all
their resources into this.

10:59.350 --> 11:00.988
Tammy, how do I work
this thing?!

11:01.020 --> 11:02.851
(chirps)
Oh, thanks.

11:02.890 --> 11:04.221
So, do you know

11:04.260 --> 11:06.899
who your husband put in
charge of that task force?

11:06.930 --> 11:08.921
Glenn Childs.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.097
(chuckles)

11:10.130 --> 11:11.768
Small world, huh?

11:11.800 --> 11:13.165
You go to the deepest heart
of Appalachia,

11:13.200 --> 11:14.997
you will not find a town smaller
than Chicago.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.099
(clears throat)

11:17.140 --> 11:19.870
Up there, top two boxes.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.838
Why didn't you put
Patrice on the stand?

11:25.880 --> 11:27.848
Oh, she had priors.
The jury would think

11:27.880 --> 11:29.245
she was lying to protect
her husband.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.748
You need to be calm for that.

11:31.790 --> 11:33.883
You know, I just think
I'll live with the mystery.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.081
Look, it wouldn't
have mattered anyway.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.428
It all came _down
to the eyeWItness.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.950
The med student?
Yeah.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.423
Everything else
was circumstantial.

11:40.460 --> 11:41.290
The blood spatter.

11:41.330 --> 11:42.888
Clarence was wearing
a Bulls sweatshirt

11:42.930 --> 11:43.897
two days after the murder.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.137
But that lady stood

11:47.170 --> 11:49.297
right up in court,
pointed at Clarence

11:49.340 --> 11:51.001
and said, "He did it."

11:51.870 --> 11:53.838
That's when I
knew it was over.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.068
WOMAN:
That movie was awful,
wasn't it?

11:57.110 --> 11:58.975
My dad taped it for me.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.171
First of all, I was in there
buying cat food.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.778
And I was alone.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.811
And, then, all of a sudden,
I'm this blonde coed

12:04.850 --> 12:06.954
_who falls in love
With a married man.

12:06.990 --> 12:07.979
Was anything right
in it?

12:08.020 --> 12:11.387
Well, um, I did see him--
Wilcox.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.920
That was true.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.053
He ran through the door,
he fired his gun,

12:15.100 --> 12:17.864
he yelled at me
to kiss the floor,

12:17.900 --> 12:20.334
but I peered up,
and I saw him

12:20.370 --> 12:21.928
kill that police officer.

12:21.970 --> 12:23.506
You have no doubts?

12:23.540 --> 12:25.337
I've seen people die--

12:25.370 --> 12:27.474
I... a lot of people
die, actually,

12:27.510 --> 12:28.909
on the operating table.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.977
I worked for a summer
in South Chicago.

12:32.010 --> 12:35.446
But I've only seen
one person murdered.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.209
It's not something
you forget.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.911
Do you think we're on
a fool's errand?

12:38.950 --> 12:41.259
I think we all have a job to do.

12:41.290 --> 12:42.826
I save the lives

12:42.860 --> 12:45.078
of some people who I know,
as soon as they get well,

12:45.130 --> 12:46.825
are going to go out and kill.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.327
But I still try to save them.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.419
It's your job to
try to get him off.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.267
It's the prosecutor's
job to stop you.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.439
It's my job to tell the truth.

12:54.470 --> 12:57.109
I would say, "Good luck,"
but I wouldn't mean it.

12:58.370 --> 13:00.076
Take care.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.242
What do you think?

13:03.280 --> 13:04.872
I think we're in trouble.

13:08.850 --> 13:09.919
Now, what am I
looking for?

13:09.950 --> 13:11.986
Just watch.

13:14.020 --> 13:15.385
Okay.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.355
The police believe that
man just killed someone,

13:18.390 --> 13:21.951
and you are the only
eyewitness, so...

13:23.370 --> 13:25.429
That's the six-pack
photo array

13:25.470 --> 13:27.267
the police
present to you.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.836
Which one is it?

13:33.040 --> 13:34.268
DIANE:
That's him.

13:36.140 --> 13:37.277
(chuckling)

13:37.310 --> 13:38.800
Yeah, maybe. Hold on.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.072
Yeah.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.414
You're confident?

13:43.450 --> 13:46.089
I'm confident.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.257
You're wrong.

13:47.290 --> 13:49.053
(all laughing)

13:49.090 --> 13:50.626
The culprit
isn't one of these.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.287
This is when we explain
to the jury

13:52.330 --> 13:54.958
about cross-racial
identification.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.468
Studies still haven't
adequately explained why,

13:57.500 --> 13:59.559
but it's harder
for Cauca5ians

13:59.600 --> 14:03.366
to identify subtle differences
in African-American faces,

14:03.410 --> 14:06.004
and African-Americans
in Cauca5ians.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.598
And how much do you charge
to say that?

14:07.640 --> 14:10.108
My consultation rates
are comparable.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.345
$20,000
for a routine appeal.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.938
WILL:
Well,

14:13.980 --> 14:15.117
we filed an evidentiary appeal,

14:15.150 --> 14:17.084
but we don't know
if we have it yet.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.441
Would you like to try it?

14:30.030 --> 14:31.463
KALIN DA:
Let me guess.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.968
A terrorist.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.389
You don't need
a story, do you?

14:45.310 --> 14:47.471
Which one is it?

14:48.520 --> 14:50.147
None of them.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.487
You're confident?

14:58.730 --> 15:00.197
Nope.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.356
Number three.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.231
MAN:
Hey.

15:07.270 --> 15:08.339
Hide everything,
quick!

15:08.370 --> 15:09.689
Here comes the
opp05ition.

15:09.740 --> 15:11.162
S'up, Muller.
Hey, Shores.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.336
Busy day, I see.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.406
Hey, we're at
a 65% clearance rate.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.579
We're doing our part
to clean up after you.

15:16.610 --> 15:19.101
Yeah, looks that way.

15:19.150 --> 15:22.415
So... Clarence Wilcox.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.247
Tell me about
his lineup.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.042
That was six years ago.

15:26.090 --> 15:28.012
Yeah.

15:28.060 --> 15:28.981
(sighs)

15:29.020 --> 15:31.727
Well, lady comes in,
describes the suspect.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.194
Male, black, mid-20$,
six feet tall,

15:34.230 --> 15:36.095
uh, wearing
a Bulls sweatshirt.

15:36.130 --> 15:38.064
So, uh... well, she seemed
pretty certain,

15:38.100 --> 15:41.069
so we, uh, went over to Howie,
and he did a sketch.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.068
Yeah. Yeah.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.099
So, we found
your guy.

15:44.140 --> 15:45.402
He matched the sketch.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.271
He had blood spatter
on his sweat top.

15:47.310 --> 15:50.108
He tried to wash the blood
out, but, uh, he failed.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.344
So, we put him in a lineup.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.540
Six guys, all black.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.468
All the same height,
same build.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.215
Lady pointed right at him.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.148
And...?

15:57.190 --> 16:00.318
And... and we went out
for steaks afterwards.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.157
I don't know what
you want to hear.

16:02.190 --> 16:03.726
Yep. What I want to hear

16:03.760 --> 16:06.024
is that you didn't put
your thumb on the scale.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.152
No hint, no nod,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.054
no nudge?

16:09.100 --> 16:10.124
No hint, no nod, no nudge.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.159
And what about
a six-pack?

16:11.200 --> 16:13.191
Did you show her
the six-pack first?

16:13.240 --> 16:15.162
_ Is it in the
investigative report?

16:18.240 --> 16:19.730
Then, no.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.476
Wow.

16:21.510 --> 16:24.149
You've lost your sense
of humor these days.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.374
(laughs)

16:37.260 --> 16:38.557
Hey, Muller.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.592
What's up?

17:01.850 --> 17:04.546
I thought you weren't
helping on this one.

17:05.820 --> 17:08.152
The eyewitness described him
as a six-foot black man,

17:08.190 --> 17:11.284
mid-205,
in a Bulls sweatshirt.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.423
Oh, my God.

17:13.460 --> 17:16.122
Yeah. The only one
in a Bulls sweatshirt.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.161
They showed
the eyewitness

17:17.200 --> 17:18.189
this six-pack
before the lineup.

17:18.230 --> 17:20.095
I've got to get
this to Will.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.289
It's enough for an
evidentiary appeal.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.364
Probably,
but if you're going

17:22.400 --> 17:24.061
to go all the way
with this,

17:24.110 --> 17:25.759
you're going to have
to talk to your husband.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.209
My husband? Why?

17:27.240 --> 17:28.207
He knows where the bodies
are buried.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.741
No.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.270
Thanks for this.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.640
You okay?

17:34.680 --> 17:36.648
Yep.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.752
Okay.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.449
So, we got our retrial.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.195
Good job on getting
that six-pack.

17:51.230 --> 17:52.367
Oh, that was Kalinda.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.594
Now things
get interesting.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.232
Bree, I want you
to pull together

17:55.270 --> 17:56.567
everything we have
from the first trial.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.306
Cary and Alicia,
I want you

17:58.340 --> 17:59.659
to reinterview
all the Witnesses.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.234
Six years go by,
people have

18:01.280 --> 18:02.838
a very different memory
of things.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.279
And get Kalinda
to undercut this eyewitness.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.402
Look into her background,

18:05.450 --> 18:06.644
whatever dirt
you can dig up.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.874
You're not going
to find anything.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.319
We'll see.
Everybody's got something.

18:09.350 --> 18:10.612
Okay.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.618
Today's a win.
Now, let's see about tomorrow.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.781
(murmuring)

18:29.900 --> 18:31.458
MAN (over P.A.):
Peter Florrick.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.637
Report to interview room five.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.308
Florrick, interview room five.

18:57.430 --> 18:59.421
(door closes)

19:15.720 --> 19:17.415
KaHnda?

19:17.450 --> 19:18.610
Yeah.

19:18.650 --> 19:20.686
Where's Alicia?

19:45.910 --> 19:47.639
Pat.

20:02.860 --> 20:04.327
KALINDA:
Your wife doesn't want

20:04.370 --> 20:06.622
to visit you to get
your take on this case.

20:06.670 --> 20:09.389
I don't deal in the same
moral shades of black and white,

20:09.440 --> 20:11.362
so... hi.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.809
What case?

20:12.840 --> 20:14.330
Clarence Wilcox.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.507
She's defending a cop killer.

20:16.540 --> 20:18.679
But he did it.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.572
You know he did it.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.611
What I know and what I don't
have shifted a bit.

20:25.420 --> 20:26.910
This goes back
to Childs.

20:26.950 --> 20:29.009
He was top man
on that case.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.688
Yeah. He's not happy
about the retrial.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.652
This could hurt Childs.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.349
It could.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.766
It's an interesting dynamic,
isn't it?

20:37.800 --> 20:41.668
If Childs does poorly,

20:41.700 --> 20:43.759
voters remember me fondly.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.370
You know what I
like about you?

20:46.410 --> 20:47.877
You're three months into
a ten-year sentence,

20:47.910 --> 20:50.504
and you're plotting your
political comeback.

20:50.550 --> 20:54.316
Politics is just a game
of Chutes and Ladders.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.773
Right now, I'm at square one.

20:58.620 --> 20:59.644
Here's our problem.

20:59.690 --> 21:00.884
You see that?

21:02.320 --> 21:03.287
Conver_sation
between family members

21:03.330 --> 21:06.959
and convicts is subject
to prison surveillance--

21:06.990 --> 21:10.699
except under certain
circumstances.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.960
Conjugal circumstances.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.764
Now, you and I
are adults.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.564
We can talk honestly
and directly.

21:19.610 --> 21:21.601
I can help you
with your case,

21:21.640 --> 21:24.746
but I can't help you.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.378
CLARENCE:
I've done other things
in my life--

21:28.420 --> 21:30.945
and if you want, I can
tell you about them...

21:30.990 --> 21:33.584
but I didn't do this.

21:34.690 --> 21:37.011
Did the officer
who took your mug shot...

21:37.060 --> 21:38.357
Shores.

21:38.390 --> 21:39.857
Right-- Detective Shores.

21:39.890 --> 21:42.051
Did he put you
in that Bulls sweatshirt?

21:42.100 --> 21:43.567
No.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.363
Did anybody else?

21:46.400 --> 21:48.391
No, I... I came
in wearing it.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.032
Didn't they want it
for evidence?

21:50.070 --> 21:52.709
Yeah, but they wanted
to take my mug shot first.

21:52.740 --> 21:55.402
They made you keep it on
for the mug shot?

21:55.440 --> 21:56.634
Yeah.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.942
Did they say why?

21:58.980 --> 22:01.517
No, but when I tried
to take it off,

22:01.550 --> 22:03.586
that guy, Shores, he said, "No.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.609
Keep it on."

22:04.650 --> 22:06.880
They wanted it in the picture.

22:12.590 --> 22:15.491
And, here we are again,
Mrs. Florrick.

22:15.530 --> 22:17.418
Your Honor?

22:17.470 --> 22:19.119
And who do we have over here?

22:19.170 --> 22:21.764
Oh, ASA Becker
and, my goodness,

22:21.800 --> 22:23.609
the deputy state's attorney,

22:23.640 --> 22:24.834
Mr. Brody.
H-how are you today?

22:24.870 --> 22:26.428
We're ready, Your Honor.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.802
It's strange that we have
to be ready at all because

22:28.840 --> 22:30.649
I thought this case
was previously adjudicated,

22:30.680 --> 22:32.443
but the appellate court
has found reason

22:32.480 --> 22:34.619
to reverse my ruling.

22:34.650 --> 22:36.140
Not by our hand,
Your Honor.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.215
That's right, so...

22:37.250 --> 22:39.946
who saw fit to question
my ruling, Mrs. Florrick?

22:39.990 --> 22:41.981
Your Honor,
we mean no disrespect.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.920
We believe Your Honor was given
incorrect information

22:43.960 --> 22:45.484
by those trying
the case.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.919
Ah, good, well, as long
as there's no disrespect.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.689
I mean, I guess it's better
to be considered

22:49.730 --> 22:52.096
a fool than a cheat, right?

22:52.130 --> 22:53.893
Well, shall we begin,

22:53.940 --> 22:55.430
Mr. Becker?

22:55.470 --> 22:57.506
Your Honor, we would
like to introduce

22:57.540 --> 22:58.905
into the record
the transcripts

22:58.940 --> 23:00.066
from the first trial.

23:00.110 --> 23:01.475
Objection.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.546
Overruled.
So moved.

23:04.580 --> 23:06.502
The prosecution
rests, Your Honor.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.449
Well, thank you,
Mr. Brody.

23:12.450 --> 23:15.681
Mr. Gardener,
are you ready to proceed?

23:23.030 --> 23:24.588
(whispering):
Okay.

23:27.570 --> 23:30.607
Um... I-I must admit

23:30.640 --> 23:32.460
we're caught a bit off guard.

23:32.510 --> 23:35.638
Yes, my guess is that was
Mr. Brody's intention.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.578
It was, Your Honor.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.200
WILL:
Uh, defense requests

23:39.250 --> 23:40.649
recess until_
tomorrow morning.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.011
No, no,

23:42.050 --> 23:44.689
no, no, you see, I know
how this works, Counselor.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.915
You still need time
to prep your Witnesses.

23:46.950 --> 23:49.009
Now, Mr. Brody
has surprised you,

23:49.060 --> 23:50.618
and now the ball
is in your court.

23:52.660 --> 23:54.753
Actually, Your Honor,
our Witnesses are

23:54.800 --> 23:56.199
on their way to
court right now.

23:56.230 --> 23:59.495
CUESTA:
Oh, good, well, then we
just need a short recess.

23:59.530 --> 24:01.031
Ten minutes.

24:01.070 --> 24:02.833
Yes, I know
I said tomorrow, sir,

24:02.870 --> 24:04.508
but this could be a matter
of life and death...

24:04.540 --> 24:05.507
What time do you think

24:05.540 --> 24:06.564
you'll be back from Baltimore?

24:06.610 --> 24:07.679
Call me back With an ETA.

24:07.710 --> 24:08.802
Can you please

24:08.840 --> 24:12.844
have him call me back
as soon as he gets this message?

24:12.880 --> 24:13.869
Got one.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.717
Two hours away.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.581
We need to talk.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.087
Oh, we're short
a Witness.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.849
Remember what I said about
Vi5iting your husband?

24:20.890 --> 24:21.857
Yes.

24:21.890 --> 24:23.585
Well, I know you
like obsessing

24:23.630 --> 24:24.881
over _the_ethical
niceties.

24:24.930 --> 24:28.024
Illinois Court ruling
1.6 subsection "C."

24:28.060 --> 24:30.824
An attorney may use leaked
information, just not...

24:30.870 --> 24:31.996
Kalinda, there's no need.

24:32.030 --> 24:33.964
Peter's got nothing
on this case.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.638
He does.

24:35.670 --> 24:38.138
How do you know?

24:39.170 --> 24:41.877
I saw him.

24:42.910 --> 24:45.003
You saw him?

24:45.050 --> 24:46.039
You saw Peter?

24:46.080 --> 24:47.638
Yeah.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.046
You visited my husband
in prison?

24:52.090 --> 24:53.216
I used to work for him.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.182
I told you that.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.154
How often did you visit
my husband in prison?

24:56.190 --> 24:57.157
Please don't
go there.

24:57.190 --> 24:58.748
Why not?

24:58.790 --> 25:02.726
Because it's not pertinent
and it's not true.

25:03.770 --> 25:06.022
Don't...

25:07.640 --> 25:10.268
...visit my husband
in prison.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.164
Then you visit him.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.872
You want to help
Clarence, go visit him.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.175
CUESTA:
Well?

25:20.210 --> 25:22.212
Defense calls Dete_ctive
Alec Shores as a Witness.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.979
Objection, Your Honor.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.681
Detective Shores isn't on
the defense's witness list.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.687
That's right,

25:26.720 --> 25:27.914
he's on yours.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.587
Well, is he in court anyway?

25:29.620 --> 25:30.780
Maybe we can get
something done today.

25:32.790 --> 25:34.326
I want you
to do this.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.258
Cary prepped for it.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.597
You know it?

25:36.630 --> 25:37.767
Then let's go.

25:39.800 --> 25:43.600
(clears throat)

25:43.640 --> 25:45.938
SHORES:
Yeah, that's the sweatshirt
he was wearing.

25:45.970 --> 25:47.130
So?

25:47.170 --> 25:48.876
And you don't think
it's prejudicial

25:48.910 --> 25:52.209
to put only one suspect
wearing a Bulls sweatshirt

25:52.250 --> 25:54.343
in a photo lineup
intended to find

25:54.380 --> 25:56.177
a suspect in a
Bulls sweatshirt?

25:56.220 --> 25:58.916
I don't know.
It's What he was wearing.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.918
And you found bloodstains
on this sweatshirt?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.313
Yeah, he tried
to wash the blood out,

26:02.360 --> 26:03.179
but it left a stain.

26:03.220 --> 26:05.279
And where was the
stain, Detective?

26:05.330 --> 26:07.218
Where? Here.

26:07.260 --> 26:08.192
The Witness

26:08.230 --> 26:11.063
is pointing to the forearm
of his right sleeve.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.261
And how did the suspect
explain the stain?

26:13.300 --> 26:15.962
Yeah, he said he, uh,
he was in a pickup game

26:16.000 --> 26:18.036
the night before the
murder, made contact,

26:18.070 --> 26:19.162
and he got a nosebleed.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.132
And this blood matched
the victim's?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.944
No, the, uh, the police lab
could not get a DNA match.

26:23.980 --> 26:26.744
Since he washed the shirt,
it degraded the blood.

26:26.780 --> 26:28.213
So that would be a "no"?

26:29.080 --> 26:30.308
That would be a "no."

26:31.850 --> 26:34.284
Detective,
I'm curious,

26:34.320 --> 26:36.288
if you got a nosebleed
in a pickup game,

26:36.320 --> 26:37.685
What would you do?

26:37.730 --> 26:39.254
I don't understand
the question, ma'am.

26:39.290 --> 26:41.053
You're playing
some two-on-two,

26:41.100 --> 26:43.022
you want to keep playing,
your nose is bleeding.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.789
What do you do?

26:44.830 --> 26:47.321
What do you do?
You do... you know.

26:47.370 --> 26:48.962
Let the record show

26:49.000 --> 26:51.833
that Detectiv_e Shores
attempted to Wipe his nose

26:51.870 --> 26:53.838
With the forearm of
his right sleeve.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.075
Excuse me, Your Honor, he
did nothing of the kind.

26:56.110 --> 26:58.908
Consistent With the stain
on the accused's sweatshirt.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.168
Objection.
Detective Shores, What

27:01.220 --> 27:02.209
were you preparing to do?

27:02.250 --> 27:05.219
Your Honor, I was preparing
to raise my right hand

27:05.250 --> 27:07.138
to my face
to Wipe my nose.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.379
Objection sustained.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.887
Continue, Mrs. Florrick.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.989
Detective,
isn't it true

27:14.030 --> 27:17.693
that the only reason
you arrested Mr. Wilcox

27:17.730 --> 27:19.823
is because he was wearing
a Bulls sweatshirt?

27:19.870 --> 27:23.738
No, he matched
the physical description.

27:23.770 --> 27:24.839
Detective,

27:24.870 --> 27:26.360
do you own a Chicago
Bulls sweatshirt?

27:26.410 --> 27:27.672
Objection, Your Honor.

27:27.710 --> 27:28.677
What's the point here?

27:28.710 --> 27:29.836
I am trying
to show

27:29.880 --> 27:32.178
that at the time of
Mr. Wilcox's arrest,

27:32.210 --> 27:33.939
Bulls apparel was
quite popular,

27:33.980 --> 27:35.777
so therefore

27:35.820 --> 27:38.243
_it wouldn't be unusual to
find a multitude of suspects

27:38.290 --> 27:40.144
wearing Bulls sweatshirts.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.420
Overruled.

27:44.460 --> 27:46.087
Answer
the question.

27:46.130 --> 27:50.191
No, I do not own
one of those.

27:50.230 --> 27:51.390
You're under oath,
Detective Shores.

27:51.430 --> 27:53.227
I-I understand that,
Your Honor.

27:53.270 --> 27:54.430
I-I'm not a fan.

27:54.470 --> 27:55.232
Well, I am.

27:55.270 --> 27:57.192
I have a Bulls
sweatshirt identical

27:57.240 --> 27:58.935
to that one.
Your Honor, objection.

27:58.970 --> 28:00.460
I'm-I'm sorry,

28:00.510 --> 28:02.307
you're objecting to me?

28:02.340 --> 28:04.843
No. I'm just...

28:04.880 --> 28:07.405
objecting to the...
general tenor of...

28:07.450 --> 28:10.783
Lenny, do you have one
of these Bulls sweats?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.408
Judy, how about you?

28:13.450 --> 28:14.849
Anyone else?

28:20.230 --> 28:21.197
Your Honor,

28:21.230 --> 28:22.788
given this testimony, we request

28:22.830 --> 28:24.195
that Detective
Shores' work product

28:24.230 --> 28:26.118
be excluded from the record.
Yeah,

28:26.170 --> 28:27.421
nice try, Mr. Gardener,

28:27.470 --> 28:29.734
but there's nothing here
that rises to the level

28:29.770 --> 28:30.589
of "fruit
of the forbidden tree,"

28:30.640 --> 28:32.403
so you'll have
to do better than that.

28:32.440 --> 28:33.805
But you
and Mrs. Florrick

28:33.840 --> 28:35.239
do get an "E"

28:35.280 --> 28:36.406
for effort.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.429
Any further
questions?

28:39.450 --> 28:42.339
No, Your Honor.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.293
You got some traction
on Clarence Wilcox?

28:54.330 --> 28:55.297
Looks like it.

28:55.330 --> 28:57.195
And what happened with Cary?
What do you mean?

28:57.230 --> 28:59.494
You have him running
something down with Kalinda?

28:59.530 --> 29:01.088
Oh, right, his choice.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.495
When you bumped him
from second chair.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.770
Am I being grounded?

29:07.810 --> 29:09.801
We had an agreement.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.047
Six months and we see
What cream rises to the top.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.047
And we are...

29:13.080 --> 29:14.775
seeing.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.811
Not if you're promoting
one over the other.

29:18.850 --> 29:21.956
Look, Diane,

29:21.990 --> 29:26.222
I want to be very specific
here, very clear.

29:26.260 --> 29:29.388
Alicia is a
secret weapon.

29:29.430 --> 29:31.398
She freaks him out.

29:31.430 --> 29:33.569
Cary?
No, Matan.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.535
She's a junior associate, and
the state's attorney's office

29:36.570 --> 29:39.334
can't think straight
around her.

29:39.370 --> 29:41.201
Just dangle Alicia
in front of them,

29:41.240 --> 29:44.505
and they lose control of
their case and their bowels.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.802
Okay, and What about her?

29:46.850 --> 29:48.272
Her?

29:48.320 --> 29:49.446
Alicia?

29:49.480 --> 29:50.447
What do
you mean?

29:50.480 --> 29:52.186
She's still Florrick's Wife.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.312
She has an agenda,

29:53.350 --> 29:55.056
Whether you believe it
or not.

29:55.090 --> 29:56.853
And what would that be?

29:56.890 --> 30:00.326
Embarrassing the man who
derailed her husband's career.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.056
WOMAN:
There is no audio
or Visual recording,

30:03.100 --> 30:05.364
there is no monitoring,

30:05.400 --> 30:07.322
and there is
no outside intervention.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.235
There is a panic button

30:09.270 --> 30:10.862
located just inside
the front door

30:10.910 --> 30:13.208
should you require
our assistance.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.299
For security reasons, you
Will not be permitted

30:15.340 --> 30:17.535
to leave the premises
until 6:00 am. tomorrow

30:17.580 --> 30:20.242
unless said panic
button is activated.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.817
Turn around and
raise your arms.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.496
KALIN DA:
You're sure?

30:36.530 --> 30:39.021
Here's the thing, Miss.

30:39.070 --> 30:41.265
You phoned the cops
about an armed robbery

30:41.300 --> 30:42.437
a week after_the_one
we're investigating.

30:42.470 --> 30:44.233
We thought it might be
the same suspect

30:44.270 --> 30:46.204
because you're only two blocks
away from the other.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.502
The suspect--

30:47.540 --> 30:50.873
was he possibly wearing
a Bulls sweatshirt?

30:50.910 --> 30:54.414
Okay, thank you.

30:54.450 --> 30:57.214
(speaks loudly
in native language)

30:57.250 --> 30:59.218
Well, this is
kind of cool.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.115
Kind of _out_here
investigating.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.184
You're chipper,
aren't you?

31:02.220 --> 31:03.289
Dangerously chipper.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.286
Okay, so here's the plan.

31:06.330 --> 31:07.957
We look for
armed robberies

31:08.000 --> 31:09.956
_after Clarence
Wilcox was arrested

31:10.000 --> 31:11.592
and see if any of them match
this sketch.

31:11.630 --> 31:13.894
That way we get
another suspect in court.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.135
We'll split
the interviews.

31:16.170 --> 31:17.967
How long you been working
at Stern, Lockhart?

31:18.010 --> 31:19.159
No.
What?

31:19.210 --> 31:20.404
Ask them about
the MO,

31:20.440 --> 31:21.338
the Bulls
sweatshirt,

31:21.380 --> 31:22.938
anything that's remotely
similar to Clarence.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.140
What did I do?

31:24.180 --> 31:25.477
Uninterested.

31:25.510 --> 31:27.444
You're uninterested
in talking?

31:27.480 --> 31:29.311
How much would you imagine
we'd have in common?

31:29.350 --> 31:31.284
I don't like talking to people
I have a lot in common with.

31:31.320 --> 31:34.084
Okay, I have a
proposition for you.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.657
Find this person, I'll tell
you whatever you want to know.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.385
Whatever I want to know?

31:38.430 --> 31:39.328
And more.

31:39.360 --> 31:43.228
Okay, you just saved
Clarence Wilcox's life.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.660
Cary.

31:52.970 --> 31:54.938
There's one
for you, too.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.968
(beeping)

32:23.140 --> 32:24.630
Hi.

32:24.670 --> 32:27.002
Hi.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.347
Is this weird
or what?

32:37.380 --> 32:39.940
Weird.

32:40.790 --> 32:45.659
And in such pretty
accommodations.

32:45.690 --> 32:47.749
Well, I told them
to put in that painting.

32:47.790 --> 32:50.293
(both chuckle)

32:51.370 --> 32:54.089
Listen, I-I have
to ask you a favor.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.260
No, it's nothing.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.734
I know we have a lot
of work to do, but...

33:02.040 --> 33:04.440
I haven't taken a shower
alone in months.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.038
Of course.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.617
Sorry, go.
Thanks.

33:25.770 --> 33:28.034
(water running)

33:32.470 --> 33:34.734
The weak link
in this case is Shores.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.444
the case falls apart.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.488
47th Street Homicide.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.750
What's that?
Double-homicide.

33:48.790 --> 33:52.351
Accused was shot in the back.

33:52.390 --> 33:54.290
Shores was accused
of planting a gun.

33:54.330 --> 33:57.549
Was it proven?
Didn't have to be.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.068
At a suppression hearing,

34:00.100 --> 34:01.328
the judge ruled the
gun inadmissable.

34:01.370 --> 34:03.099
I had to DP the case.

34:03.140 --> 34:05.028
Decline to prosecute.

34:13.580 --> 34:15.172
What?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.346
Was he this man?

34:20.390 --> 34:21.379
Was the robber this man?

34:21.420 --> 34:23.183
It could be.

34:23.220 --> 34:24.585
I'm not good With faces.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.154
It went so fast.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.350
Who are you again?

34:27.390 --> 34:28.652
A lawyer.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.122
You're a lavwer?

34:30.160 --> 34:33.391
What are you doing here?
I don't know.

34:33.430 --> 34:36.467
Was this man, this robber, was
he wearing a Bulls sweatshirt?

34:36.500 --> 34:37.797
Bulls sweatshirt?

34:37.840 --> 34:38.966
Really, I couldn't say.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.672
He burst through the door,
and the first thing he said

34:41.710 --> 34:43.371
was "Kiss the floor,
don't look up,"

34:43.410 --> 34:44.741
so I didn't.
He said What?

34:44.780 --> 34:46.509
He said, "Kiss the floor,

34:46.550 --> 34:47.869
don't look up."
He said those
exact words?

34:47.910 --> 34:49.411
He had a gun on me.

34:49.450 --> 34:51.441
I think I would
remember what he said.

34:51.490 --> 34:52.514
Sounded like good advice

34:52.550 --> 34:54.415
at the time so
I kissed the floor.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.688
Okay, thank you very much.

34:55.720 --> 34:57.859
Hey, Kalinda.

34:57.890 --> 35:00.324
So, this guy robbed him,
told him to kiss the floor

35:00.360 --> 35:02.191
in May 2003?
Yeah.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.652
A month after_
Clarence was conVIcted.

35:03.700 --> 35:05.429
And here's the thing:
the cops told him

35:05.470 --> 35:07.563
they caught this robber
a month later, maybe two.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.898
So, it couldn't be Clarence
because he was in jail.
Yep.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.329
And this guy, he was a really
nice guy, by the way,

35:12.370 --> 35:14.235
he was supposed to
go to court to testify,

35:14.280 --> 35:15.304
but they told him
they didn't need him

35:15.340 --> 35:16.876
because the robber
copped a plea.

35:16.910 --> 35:19.299
Okay, armed robbery,
no injuries, money taken.

35:19.350 --> 35:21.511
He probably got
four years.

35:21.550 --> 35:23.313
Whoa, let's not
lose track here.

35:23.350 --> 35:24.681
What about my reward?

35:24.720 --> 35:26.813
Mike, can you look up
armed robbery plea bargains

35:26.850 --> 35:29.216
in the summer of 2003?

35:29.260 --> 35:30.659
What reward?

35:30.690 --> 35:32.351
No, no, you know
What reward.

35:32.390 --> 35:34.153
Let me just think of some
really embarrassing question.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.760
No, I'm looking for
an armed robber.

35:43.670 --> 35:46.901
I bet this is the first time
this has happened in here.

35:46.940 --> 35:49.602
You okay?

35:49.640 --> 35:51.904
I'm great.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.247
Are you joking?

35:53.280 --> 35:55.214
No, I'm serious.

35:55.250 --> 35:59.346
_ This is the closest
five minutes of normalcy

35:59.390 --> 36:00.880
I've had in eight months.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.923
It's like we're in camp.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.224
Want me to tell you a story?

36:28.280 --> 36:30.419
Good night.

36:36.990 --> 36:38.184
Your Honor, please,
this is too much.

36:38.230 --> 36:41.393
Detectiv_e Shores was never
found gle of planting a gun.

36:41.430 --> 36:42.749
Because the judge suppressed
the gun evidence

36:42.800 --> 36:44.665
and the State's Attorney
declined to prosecute.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.292
Is that What Peter was saying?

36:46.330 --> 36:47.319
WILL: _
Excuse me, Sir!

36:47.370 --> 36:48.564
You can talk to me.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.363
You leave my junior associate
out of this.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.004
Come on, let's face facts here,
Your Honor...

36:52.040 --> 36:54.474
I think that's what we're
trying to do, Mr. Brody.

36:54.510 --> 36:57.877
Detective Shores is an
honored homicide detective.

36:57.910 --> 37:00.743
I have worked with him for a
decade now and he has been

37:00.780 --> 37:02.418
nothing but professional and...
A perjurer?

37:03.420 --> 37:05.342
Excuse me, Your Honor?

37:05.390 --> 37:07.745
I_ don't like someone
staring me right in the eye

37:07.790 --> 37:09.257
and lying to me,
and there's not

37:09.290 --> 37:11.679
a cop I know
Who isn't a Bulls fan.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.686
Your Honor, that is irrelevant.

37:13.730 --> 37:15.459
I'll decide what's irrelevant.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.694
If you want to file a complaint,

37:16.730 --> 37:18.368
that's why Judy is here.

37:18.400 --> 37:22.734
Now, Mr. Gardner, I'm finding
now reason to reverse myself.

37:24.470 --> 37:27.462
strong "fruit of the
forbidden tree" argument.

37:27.510 --> 37:28.579
If I can't trust Shores,

37:28.610 --> 37:30.703
then I can't trust the evidence
that's tied to him.

37:30.740 --> 37:33.300
So, the line-up,
the Bulls sweatshirt,

37:33.350 --> 37:36.478
the artist's sketch, they are
now stricken from the record.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.441
Your Honor.
Oh, shut up, Matan.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.289
You've still got
the eyewitness.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.288
That's the cornerstone
of your case anyway.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.618
Now, Mrs. Florrick,
Mr. Gardner.

37:43.660 --> 37:46.424
Do you have any other
tricks up your sleeve?

37:46.460 --> 37:48.724
No, Your Honor.
Good.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.991
Then we are in recess
until tomorrow at 10:00

37:52.030 --> 37:54.498
When I will decide on
this case a second time.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.633
Are we all happy?

37:56.670 --> 37:59.434
Good.

37:59.470 --> 38:01.973
That's Michael Parsons.

38:02.010 --> 38:03.671
The one that said
"kiss the floor."

38:03.710 --> 38:06.349
He was convicted of four
armed robberies in South Chicago

38:06.380 --> 38:07.472
over a two year period.

38:07.510 --> 38:08.716
KALINDA:
He pled and was sentenced

38:08.750 --> 38:10.479
to Wabash Valley
for four years.

38:10.520 --> 38:11.839
So, this is the killer?

38:11.890 --> 38:13.778
We believe so.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.378
Where is he now?

38:15.420 --> 38:17.479
Well, that's the bad news.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.657
He's dead.

38:18.690 --> 38:21.420
He died in prison in 2006.

38:27.930 --> 38:31.036
So, they got an eyewitness
and we got nothing.

38:31.070 --> 38:32.059
WILL:
Great.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.532
That's great.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.479
Thank you for coming in, Doctor.

38:40.510 --> 38:42.819
No problem, but I wish
I could actually help you.

38:42.850 --> 38:44.511
CARY:
Well, maybe you can.

38:44.550 --> 38:46.415
We just have a picture
to show you, we discovered

38:46.450 --> 38:48.486
another man we think is
responSIble for the crime.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.680
His name is Michael Parsons,

38:49.720 --> 38:52.826
and he was_conv_icted of armed
robberies identical to yours.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.896
He even used the same
language from yours.

38:54.930 --> 38:56.591
He yelled for everyone
"to kiss the floor."

38:56.630 --> 38:58.518
I'm sorry.

38:58.570 --> 38:59.992
IfI could help
you, I would.

39:00.030 --> 39:02.635
But Clarence Wilcox
did this.

39:02.670 --> 39:05.468
Just keep an open mind,
please, Tara.

39:05.510 --> 39:09.799
This is the police sketch from
the description you gave, right?

39:09.840 --> 39:11.842
And this is the mugshot

39:11.880 --> 39:13.108
of the man we think did it.

39:13.150 --> 39:14.515
Michael Parsons.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.078
Just please look
at them carefully.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.613
(sighs):
I'm sorry.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.150
I really wish it was him.

39:25.190 --> 39:26.589
But it's not.

39:26.630 --> 39:27.927
You're sure?

39:27.960 --> 39:28.995
Yes.

39:30.560 --> 39:34.690
You're sure that Clarence
Wilcox is who you saw?

39:37.640 --> 39:40.529
Yes, I'm sure.

39:40.570 --> 39:42.629
I'm sorry, but
Clarence Wilcox did this.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.471
This isn't Clarence Wilcox.

39:49.550 --> 39:50.517
Excuse me?

39:50.550 --> 39:55.613
We switched their faces.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.629
That's Michael Parsons.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.651
It's not.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.691
It is.

40:01.730 --> 40:03.698
This is Clarence Wilcox.

40:03.730 --> 40:07.962
And you just said that
this man didn't do it.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.831
And this man did.

40:14.480 --> 40:18.109
Oh, my God.

40:23.580 --> 40:26.788
I am certain.

40:26.820 --> 40:30.608
The man I saw
killing a police officer

40:30.660 --> 40:34.221
was not Clarence Wilcox.

40:34.260 --> 40:39.459
In fact, um, Your Honor, can
I say something to Mr. Wilcox?

40:40.730 --> 40:43.563
I'm sorry.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.602
I don't know
What else to say.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.165
But I am just so sorry.

41:17.740 --> 41:19.162
JUDGE CUESTA:
Here's the thing, Mr. Brody.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.508
I don't like to be reversed.
In fact, I hate it.

41:21.540 --> 41:24.270
So, here's some advice for you
and the good State's Attorney.

41:24.310 --> 41:25.641
You keep that from happening.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.205
Your Honor, I want to insist...
No, you don't have
room to insist.

41:28.250 --> 41:30.514
And you should be grateful.

41:30.550 --> 41:34.850
I'm giving your boss an out
as big as the great outdoors.

41:34.890 --> 41:36.812
I don't understand,
Your Honor.

41:36.860 --> 41:39.727
Te||_Charles to blame
his predecessor.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.529
It's not the job
of the bench

41:44.570 --> 41:47.664
to offer you advice,
Mr. Deputy Chief.

41:47.700 --> 41:50.828
But I am just telling
you very clearly,

41:50.870 --> 41:53.737
I want this to go away.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.741
The regrettable corruption
during Peter Florrick's term

42:01.780 --> 42:03.839
still infects this department.

42:03.880 --> 42:06.940
Every step in the Wilcox case
was supervised and approved

42:06.990 --> 42:08.287
by Peter Florrick

42:08.320 --> 42:10.117
and we are doing
everything in our power

42:10.160 --> 42:11.650
to correct his mistakes.

42:11.690 --> 42:14.124
That is why I have decided

42:14.160 --> 42:18.768
to withdraw all charges
against Mr. Clarence Wilcox.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.324
(reporters clamoring)

42:20.370 --> 42:22.167
There have been no discussions
about restitution.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.736
You okay with this?

42:23.770 --> 42:25.806
Yes.

42:25.840 --> 42:26.909
(reporters yelling questions)

42:26.940 --> 42:32.105
Thank you. No more questions.
That is all. Thank you.

42:39.750 --> 42:41.889
They say he's
coming out this door.

42:45.390 --> 42:48.951
You know...

42:49.000 --> 42:50.729
Words are hard.

42:50.760 --> 42:52.193
I know.

42:52.230 --> 42:53.720
It's not like people say.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.006
I never expected him to get out.

43:04.750 --> 43:07.207
(clanking, keys jingling)
