- Pleasure.

Is Dmitry unwell, do you think?

00:13.678 --> 00:15.878
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say diabetes.

This was definitely a first.

Uh, where's Van Dyke?
According to this schedule,

00:49.847 --> 00:51.347
he should have picked up
a schedule by now.

00:51.349 --> 00:53.482
- I'm sure he'll be here.
- Okay.

00:53.484 --> 00:54.750
What about Dr. Sacani?

00:54.752 --> 00:56.519
Oh, he is giving a paper at a conference

00:56.521 --> 00:58.354

Now, there's a party where you don't want

01:01.159 --> 01:02.725
Could I add a clinic patient?

Uh, he's a family friend... Dr. Tom Fancy.

He's a large-animal vet.

01:07.031 --> 01:08.397
When I was at the equestrian center,

01:08.399 --> 01:09.932
I noticed that he dropped some pounds

01:09.934 --> 01:12.068
and could possibly be
arthritic and depressed.

01:12.070 --> 01:14.203
Hmm. Uh, yeah, we can look in on him

01:45.903 --> 01:47.937
I'm good. I just need coffee.

- can you cover his patient?
- Sure, no problem.

02:00.918 --> 02:02.418
Great. Hopefully I can get him on his feet

02:02.420 --> 02:04.220

02:04.222 --> 02:05.254
Okay, and I will call his other patients,

10:18.659 --> 10:20.792
Why?
[Sighs]

10:20.794 --> 10:22.227
Okay.

10:22.229 --> 10:24.229
Are you sure you're okay to do that?

10:24.231 --> 10:26.364
Yeah, stellar.

10:26.366 --> 10:30.101
Uh... I'm gonna call Divya.

10:30.103 --> 10:34.406
I mean, I just want to know
what happened, that's all.

10:34.408 --> 10:38.510
Okay, okay, I'm in the parking lot

10:38.512 --> 10:39.711
with my buddy Tyler,

10:39.713 --> 10:42.113
and out of nowhere he goes,

10:42.115 --> 10:45.250
"hit me as hard as you can." And I'm like,

10:45.252 --> 10:47.252
"I don't know about this, Tyler."

10:47.254 --> 10:48.253
Isn't that from <i>Fight Club?</i>

10:48.255 --> 10:49.988
I can't talk about that.

10:49.990 --> 10:51.957
So you're really not gonna
tell us what happened?

10:51.959 --> 10:54.893
There is really nothing to tell.

10:54.895 --> 10:57.662
I need to check your pupils.

10:57.664 --> 11:00.632
[Sighs]
You could have a concussion.

11:00.634 --> 11:02.634
I don't have a concussion.

11:02.636 --> 11:05.270
What I do have is a pain in my ass.

11:05.272 --> 11:07.105
Well, then, bend over
and let's take a look.

11:07.107 --> 11:08.807
Hmm?

11:08.809 --> 11:10.609
Are you really gonna let him do this?

11:10.611 --> 11:15.413
What... no. [Scoffs]

11:15.415 --> 11:16.848
Do what?

11:16.850 --> 11:19.351
No excuse, no apology.

11:19.353 --> 11:22.087
I feel like he's taking advantage of you.

11:31.097 --> 11:32.831
What's going on?

11:32.833 --> 11:35.233
He suddenly started
having pain... I'm not sure.

11:35.235 --> 11:37.669
What did you do to me, huh?

11:37.671 --> 11:39.938
When did you last check your glucose?

11:39.940 --> 11:41.740
A few hours ago.

11:43.643 --> 11:45.277
[Instrument beeps]

11:45.279 --> 11:49.581
He's slipping into diabetic ketoacidosis.

11:49.583 --> 11:54.452
[Retching]

11:54.454 --> 11:55.787
Do we need an ambulance, Hank?

11:55.789 --> 11:58.023
No. Insulin and fluids.

11:58.025 --> 11:59.257
You said this was insulin.

11:59.259 --> 12:00.792
Yeah. I also said it wasn't a substitute

12:00.794 --> 12:02.527
for your own management.
[Christina translating]

12:02.529 --> 12:04.195
If you can't be bothered
to check your sugars

12:04.197 --> 12:05.530
before eating and drinking,

12:05.532 --> 12:06.798
then maybe we need to talk about

12:06.800 --> 12:08.500
an implantable glucose monitor too.

12:08.502 --> 12:10.068
[Speaks Russian]

12:10.070 --> 12:11.202
By the time you are done,

12:11.204 --> 12:13.305
I will be like six-million-ruble man.

12:13.307 --> 12:16.841
No, no pump, no monitor, no nothing.

12:16.843 --> 12:18.376
I'm doing this my way.

12:18.378 --> 12:19.844
Your way isn't working.

12:19.846 --> 12:21.546
If you don't change what you're do...

12:21.548 --> 12:23.014
Don't tell me what to do.

12:23.016 --> 12:26.584
Mister, I am diabetic for years.
I know the consequences.

12:26.586 --> 12:29.020
Right, but do you really want
to suffer them?

12:29.022 --> 12:31.957
Look, if you can't stay on top of this...

12:31.959 --> 12:33.258
[Translating]

12:33.260 --> 12:34.659
And you don't want an
implanted pump or monitor,

12:34.661 --> 12:36.628
then get someone to stay
on top of this for you.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.263
Someone to be with you 24/7

12:38.265 --> 12:39.331
who can think about your diabetes

12:39.333 --> 12:40.632
so you don't have to.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.567
[Christina finishes translating]

12:42.569 --> 12:43.702
[Speaks Russian]

12:43.704 --> 12:47.238
- Congratulations.
- What? Why?

12:47.240 --> 12:49.274
You're hired.

12:59.518 --> 13:01.886
Uh, just... just so you know,

13:01.888 --> 13:04.723
I'm not considering
going to work for Dmitry.

13:04.725 --> 13:06.658
Just so you know, I wasn't concerned.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.494
What does concern me, Hank, is his health.

13:09.496 --> 13:10.929
It is imperative that he be well

13:10.931 --> 13:12.530
for this summit tomorrow.

13:12.532 --> 13:14.499
I understand, but aside
from sitting next to him

13:14.501 --> 13:16.067
and pricking his finger every 30 minutes,

13:16.069 --> 13:17.402
I don't know what else to suggest.

13:17.404 --> 13:19.871
I have invested significant
assets in this, Hank.

13:19.873 --> 13:21.873
Everything from you yourself

13:21.875 --> 13:24.476
to a repository of rare vodkas

13:24.478 --> 13:26.211
with which to toast our success.

13:26.213 --> 13:28.079
Well, then, until I can offer you more,

13:28.081 --> 13:29.547
I suggest you delay the meeting.

13:29.549 --> 13:31.383
No. Not an option.

13:31.385 --> 13:33.485
A trigger cannot be un-pulled.

13:33.487 --> 13:35.653
Well, then, I'll keep thinking.

13:35.655 --> 13:36.921
Well, think fast.

13:36.923 --> 13:40.725
And I'll trust in your ability
to handle it.

14:02.579 --> 14:05.347
Hey.

14:05.349 --> 14:06.582
You're feeling better, huh?

14:06.584 --> 14:10.419
Mm. Ahh. Mostly.

14:10.421 --> 14:11.821
You want half?

14:11.823 --> 14:15.658
No. No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

14:15.660 --> 14:20.296
So... You want to tell me
what happened last night?

14:20.298 --> 14:21.597
No.

14:24.768 --> 14:26.335
Come on, dude.

14:26.337 --> 14:28.771
Just... As friends?

14:28.773 --> 14:30.372
We're friends?

14:30.374 --> 14:32.108
Yeah.

14:32.110 --> 14:34.343
You just offered me
half your sandwich, come on.

14:34.345 --> 14:36.445
Because I have good manners.

14:36.447 --> 14:38.347
Oh.

14:38.349 --> 14:40.583
Look, there's nothing to tell.

14:40.585 --> 14:42.885
I went to that dive bar over on 4th,

14:42.887 --> 14:46.021
and I had too much.

14:46.023 --> 14:48.023
You do that a lot?

14:48.025 --> 14:50.126
How is that your business?

14:50.128 --> 14:54.163
It's my business because
you made it my business.

14:54.165 --> 14:57.700
These are business hours,

14:57.702 --> 15:00.769
and you are a doctor
who came to work intoxicated.

15:00.771 --> 15:03.873
So I need a better explanation than,

15:03.875 --> 15:05.574
"ooh, I drank too much."

15:05.576 --> 15:11.013
Well, I'm sorry, but...

15:11.015 --> 15:12.848
I drank too much.

15:21.725 --> 15:26.061
Then I'm sorry... But you're fired.

15:33.837 --> 15:36.472
[Clears throat]

15:38.341 --> 15:40.176
[Snaps fingers]

15:46.116 --> 15:48.117
[Sighs]

15:48.119 --> 15:51.287
Just a little longer, squeaky.

15:51.289 --> 15:54.256
Okay. Okay.

15:54.258 --> 15:56.625
Let me guess, high cholesterol?

15:56.627 --> 16:00.229
[Chuckles] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

16:00.231 --> 16:02.831
She's gonna need beta-blockers
and a calcium channel blocker.

16:02.833 --> 16:05.634
So you literally saved her bacon.

16:05.636 --> 16:07.469
Oh, we don't use the "b" word.

16:07.471 --> 16:09.805
- Sorry.
- Tom, you look flushed.

16:09.807 --> 16:11.740
Well, you should see me
after I give a camel

16:11.742 --> 16:12.708
a pelvic exam.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.711
Let me take your temperature anyway.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.013
So, Tom, according to the tests we ran,

16:18.015 --> 16:20.082
we know you aren't
absorbing nutrients properly.

16:20.084 --> 16:21.483
We just don't know why yet.
[Instrument beeps]

16:21.485 --> 16:23.519
Hopefully your cultures will tell us more.

16:23.521 --> 16:25.154
101.5.

16:25.156 --> 16:27.656
Tom, I want to do
a G.I. series with contrast.

16:27.658 --> 16:31.126
Well, then, I hope you brought an X-ray.

16:31.128 --> 16:34.029
I can't believe you brought an X-ray.

16:35.298 --> 16:38.300
[Chuckles]

16:38.302 --> 16:39.835
I feel like a thoroughbred.

16:39.837 --> 16:41.237
You have one of these for horses?

16:41.239 --> 16:42.838
Of course I do.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.740
We're not that different, you and me.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.775
Driving around the Hamptons,
treating patients.

16:46.777 --> 16:49.812
It's just yours can
tell you their symptoms.

16:49.814 --> 16:51.914
- We do have it easier that way.
- Yeah.

16:51.916 --> 16:54.750
Okay, so, Tom, Crohn's, pancreatitis,

16:54.752 --> 16:57.653
and ulcerative colitis
are all malabsorption disorders

16:57.655 --> 16:59.221
that can present with fever,

16:59.223 --> 17:00.789
but I don't see any evidence of them here.

17:00.791 --> 17:03.425
- Intestinal biopsy?
- Yeah.

17:03.427 --> 17:04.960
Oh, please don't tell me
you're gonna do <i>that</i> here.

17:04.962 --> 17:06.362
No. For that you need an endoscopy,

17:06.364 --> 17:08.163
which requires fasting for a full day.

17:08.165 --> 17:10.598
Hank, as a medical professional,

17:10.601 --> 17:12.401
I appreciate how thorough you're being,

17:12.403 --> 17:15.037
but as a guy whose lawyers
don't work pro bono,

17:15.039 --> 17:16.238
I don't have time for that.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.807
I... I've gotta be here all day today

17:18.809 --> 17:20.009
and probably tomorrow too.

17:20.011 --> 17:21.076
I've got a pregnant cow

17:21.078 --> 17:22.678
with a very specific birth plan.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.747
I know the toll that the stress

17:24.749 --> 17:26.448
of a failing marriage can take.

17:26.450 --> 17:29.418
I'm seeing it with my own father.

17:29.420 --> 17:33.522
But I have to say, if working 24/7

17:33.524 --> 17:35.791
just to fight your ex is making you ill,

17:35.793 --> 17:39.461
is it worth it?

17:39.463 --> 17:41.897
Wolves, beavers, pigeons...

17:41.899 --> 17:44.199
Hell, even termites mate for life.

17:44.201 --> 17:46.535
A black vulture will even try to kill

17:46.537 --> 17:48.637
an unfaithful member of its own species.

17:48.639 --> 17:53.008
But my wife is a different kind of animal.

17:53.010 --> 17:54.476
The kind that cheats on you,

17:54.478 --> 17:56.245
and then goes after everything you've got.

17:56.247 --> 17:58.247
Which means I <i>have</i> to keep fighting,

17:58.249 --> 18:00.516
even if it kills me.

18:08.058 --> 18:09.291
<i>Privet.</i>

18:09.293 --> 18:12.027
[Chuckles]
Someone's been paying attention.

18:12.029 --> 18:13.796
Sorry you had to be in the middle

18:13.798 --> 18:15.631
of that awkward job offer before.

18:15.633 --> 18:16.632
That wasn't even about you.

18:16.634 --> 18:18.133
It wasn't?

18:18.135 --> 18:20.035
No, that was a power play.

18:20.037 --> 18:22.671
Dmitry showing he's
so unintimidated by Boris

18:22.673 --> 18:23.939
he'd steal from him

18:23.941 --> 18:25.974
without even doing him
the courtesy of hiding it.

18:25.976 --> 18:27.309
Oh.

18:27.311 --> 18:28.911
Yeah. I've worked with him enough to know

18:28.913 --> 18:31.046
that nothing they do has a single motive.

18:31.048 --> 18:33.615
Their relationship moves
on so many levels,

18:33.617 --> 18:36.218
it's like a three-dimensional
game of chess.

18:36.220 --> 18:39.054
Hmm. So here I thought
I was a good doctor.

18:39.056 --> 18:40.622
Turns out I'm just a pawn.

18:40.624 --> 18:43.292
If you weren't a great doctor,

18:43.294 --> 18:45.728
you wouldn't even be that.

18:45.730 --> 18:46.795
[Clears throat]

18:46.797 --> 18:48.297
Boris awaits you.

18:48.299 --> 18:52.167
Thank you.<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

18:57.173 --> 18:59.541
Coffee?

18:59.543 --> 19:01.910
I'm good.

19:01.912 --> 19:03.245
<i>Danke.</i>

19:03.247 --> 19:07.349
Please sit, Hank.

19:07.351 --> 19:11.053
So... How are you getting on
with Christina?

19:11.055 --> 19:13.689
Very well. Yeah, she's great.

19:13.691 --> 19:16.291
Yes, she is. Good.

19:16.293 --> 19:18.727
You two have been doing excellent work.

19:18.729 --> 19:20.996
Thank you.

19:20.998 --> 19:23.298
After the conclusion
of our meeting tomorrow,

19:23.300 --> 19:25.000
I'd like to offer my car
and driver for you

19:25.002 --> 19:26.935
to have an evening and a meal out.

19:26.937 --> 19:28.337
Together?

19:28.339 --> 19:29.905
Together, sequentially...

19:29.907 --> 19:31.240
I'll leave the details to you.

19:31.242 --> 19:33.375
Well, that's very generous.

19:33.377 --> 19:35.778
Unless there's a secondary motive.

19:35.780 --> 19:37.179
So tell me,
have you come up with a solution

19:37.181 --> 19:39.248
for the Dmitry health situation?

19:39.250 --> 19:41.950
Not really. I mean, worst case,

19:41.952 --> 19:43.786
I can check him hourly during the meeting.

19:43.788 --> 19:46.054
And long-term?

19:46.056 --> 19:49.224
Dmitry can be a... difficult friend,

19:49.226 --> 19:50.526
but he's an important ally.

19:50.528 --> 19:52.728
Uh, long-term, I guess I could always

19:52.730 --> 19:54.263
go work for Dmitry, if you want.

19:54.265 --> 19:57.766
I do not think
you'd enjoy his guest house.

19:57.768 --> 20:00.135
Ah.

20:00.137 --> 20:01.570
[Cell phone vibrates]

20:01.572 --> 20:04.773
Oh, uh, sorry. I'm on call.

20:04.775 --> 20:06.108
I'm gonna take this.

20:09.112 --> 20:10.813
Hey, what's going on?

20:10.815 --> 20:13.048
I just got the results
from Tom's cultures.

20:13.050 --> 20:14.817
Everything came back negative.

20:14.819 --> 20:16.718
Okay. What about the endoscopy?

20:16.720 --> 20:17.820
I've scheduled it,

20:17.822 --> 20:19.621
but he is not answering his phone.

20:19.623 --> 20:21.423
So what, you think he's avoiding you?

20:21.425 --> 20:22.991
I was wondering that,

20:22.993 --> 20:24.560
so I also tried from a hospital phone.

20:24.562 --> 20:26.328
Look, Hank, given his symptoms,

20:26.330 --> 20:28.831
I'm just worried that
he could be severely dehydrated

20:28.833 --> 20:30.365
and passed out.

20:30.367 --> 20:34.236
If he's still on that farm,
out in the field somewhere...

20:34.238 --> 20:35.637
- I'm on my way.
- I'll meet you there.

20:42.045 --> 20:45.247
Tom... we've been trying to reach you.

20:45.249 --> 20:48.617
I've had my hands in a pregnant heifer,

20:48.619 --> 20:50.552
and now Beulah here has got mastitis.

20:50.554 --> 20:52.855
[Exhales uneasily]

20:52.857 --> 20:56.024
Tom, are you okay?

20:56.026 --> 20:58.494
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

21:01.664 --> 21:03.365
[Cow moos]

21:03.367 --> 21:04.433
Ooh! Oh!

21:04.435 --> 21:07.603
Tom!

21:07.605 --> 21:08.971
[Groans]

21:12.798 --> 21:14.932
Is it bad?

21:14.934 --> 21:16.133
It's not life-threatening.

21:16.135 --> 21:18.169
Here, this should help with the pain.

21:18.171 --> 21:20.237
Uhh. Thank you.

21:20.239 --> 21:22.173
So it looked like you lost your balance.

21:22.175 --> 21:23.741
I was just tired.

21:23.743 --> 21:26.410
You're not just tired, Tom. You're sick.

21:26.412 --> 21:28.479
Now, were you dizzy, lightheaded,

21:28.481 --> 21:30.815
or was it something else?

21:30.817 --> 21:33.284
It was my vision. I had floaters.

21:33.286 --> 21:34.685
Huh.

21:34.687 --> 21:36.287
It sounds like possible retinopathy

21:36.289 --> 21:37.555
associated with the malabsorption.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.590
- Yep.
- Addison's disease.

21:39.592 --> 21:40.724
I don't think so.

21:40.726 --> 21:41.725
He's got none of the skin darkening

21:41.727 --> 21:43.260
that goes with Addison's.

21:43.262 --> 21:45.262
Let's find his tooth
and get him to the hospital.

21:45.264 --> 21:46.597
All right.

21:46.599 --> 21:49.200
- No, no, no.
- Tom. No. You sit.

21:49.202 --> 21:50.768
You're forgetting something.

21:50.770 --> 21:52.937
- What's that?
- Beulah's mastitis.

21:52.939 --> 21:56.273
I don't just walk out
on my patients, guys.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.676
You guys are both very similar.

21:58.678 --> 22:00.277
All right, here's what's gonna happen.

22:00.279 --> 22:02.046
Divya, you find his tooth,
but don't touch the root.

22:02.048 --> 22:03.981
That can disturb cells
that attach it to the bone.

22:03.983 --> 22:05.950
The sooner we get it back
in the socket, the better.

22:05.952 --> 22:07.084
Got it.

22:07.086 --> 22:11.489
Tom, I'll treat Beulah.

22:11.491 --> 22:13.324
You're a people doctor,
Hank. It's different.

22:13.326 --> 22:14.992
All right, so talk me through it.

22:14.994 --> 22:17.795
Well, you need to give her
an antibiotic injection.

22:17.797 --> 22:18.963
That's not so different.

22:18.965 --> 22:20.331
Into her teat canal.

22:20.333 --> 22:21.599
- That's different.
- Yeah.

22:21.601 --> 22:24.001
Okay... Found it.

22:24.003 --> 22:25.135
Great.
[Chuckles]

22:25.137 --> 22:27.271
But it is... it's filthy.

22:27.273 --> 22:29.807
So we need to rinse it off
with milk, not water, right?

22:29.809 --> 22:31.575
Right. Milk has a more neutral PH.

22:31.577 --> 22:32.877
That works out perfectly.

22:32.879 --> 22:35.412
Beulah needs a milking
before the injection anyway.

22:35.414 --> 22:38.582
Uh... [Cow moos]

22:40.552 --> 22:42.653
We're eating lunch here?

22:42.655 --> 22:44.822
[Sighs] Yeah.

22:44.824 --> 22:46.290
People say they have a great burger.

22:46.292 --> 22:48.225
So anywhere? Okay.

22:48.227 --> 22:51.328
Oh...

22:51.330 --> 22:53.564
This is where Van Dyke
was drinking last night.

22:53.566 --> 22:56.634
All right...

22:56.636 --> 22:58.736
I'm convinced there's more to his story,

22:58.738 --> 23:00.905
and I don't know why,
but I need to know what it is.

23:00.907 --> 23:02.740
I know why.

23:02.742 --> 23:04.508
Because you want to see
the best in people.

23:04.510 --> 23:07.211
And because at a time
when we need doctors,

23:07.213 --> 23:08.512
he is a known commodity.

23:08.514 --> 23:11.181
The devil you know.

23:11.183 --> 23:13.083
But don't forget, devils are evil,

23:13.085 --> 23:15.786
and evil should be punished.

23:15.788 --> 23:18.289
Whoa.

23:18.291 --> 23:20.391
Is this how you're gonna be with our kids?

23:20.393 --> 23:23.460
No excuses, take your medicine...

23:23.462 --> 23:25.229
Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out.

23:25.231 --> 23:26.330
Rah, rah, rah!

23:26.332 --> 23:27.998
Well, that's how I was raised.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.400
By a four-star general.

23:29.402 --> 23:30.834
And look how I turned out.

23:30.836 --> 23:33.103
You are pretty awesome.

23:33.105 --> 23:35.639
Thank you.

23:35.641 --> 23:38.042
So is this how you're
gonna be with our kids...

23:38.044 --> 23:39.276
a big softie?

23:39.278 --> 23:42.646
I am not a softie. I'm compassionate.

23:42.648 --> 23:43.881
Well, compassion is for charity,

23:43.883 --> 23:45.316
not for child-rearing.

23:45.318 --> 23:47.851
So you better be prepared
to step up, mister,

23:47.853 --> 23:50.554
because I am not gonna
always be the bad cop.

23:50.556 --> 23:52.156
Yes, ma'am.

23:52.158 --> 23:53.991
You joke, but maybe there are some things

23:53.993 --> 23:55.826
we need to talk about
before we get married.

23:55.828 --> 23:57.061
I'm sure there are,

23:57.063 --> 23:58.829
but how to discipline
our imaginary children

23:58.831 --> 24:00.497
is probably one
we can back-burner for now.

24:00.499 --> 24:02.132
You are so avoiding the issue.

24:02.134 --> 24:04.435
I'm not avoi... they're imaginary.

24:04.437 --> 24:07.538
I'm talking about Van Dyke.
Hank said handle it.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.273
I am. I'm...

24:09.275 --> 24:10.708
God, I know we're from Passaic.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.810
I don't think he meant,
like, <i>handle it</i> handle it.

24:12.812 --> 24:15.145
No, he meant make a decision,
which you did,

24:15.147 --> 24:17.081
only now you're second-guessing it.

24:17.083 --> 24:20.317
Don't.

24:20.319 --> 24:22.853
[Cow moos]
Uh-huh.

24:25.523 --> 24:26.991
Like that.

24:32.464 --> 24:34.164
Ah.

24:37.969 --> 24:40.204
Ehh...

24:40.206 --> 24:43.173
[Chuckles] Ow.

24:43.175 --> 24:46.577
Grab the teat...

24:46.579 --> 24:48.812
Good.

24:57.155 --> 24:58.989
Oh, I see. Okay.

25:02.027 --> 25:06.230
Okay. Cheapest retainer ever made.

25:06.232 --> 25:07.665
That should hold the tooth in place

25:07.667 --> 25:09.266
till we get you examined at the hospital.

25:09.268 --> 25:11.702
Plus, Tom, you might want
to up your brushing time.

25:11.704 --> 25:13.404
You've got a little gingivitis in there.

25:13.406 --> 25:15.339
Jeez, Hank. [Chuckles]

25:15.341 --> 25:17.408
What kind of medicine doesn't he practice?

25:19.210 --> 25:22.179
Can I help you?

25:24.049 --> 25:26.216
Yeah. Yeah, actually.

25:26.218 --> 25:28.585
We would like two IPAs,

25:28.587 --> 25:30.521
uh, two Dive burgers, one with cheese.

25:30.523 --> 25:33.157
And was this guy in here last night?

25:33.159 --> 25:36.226
[Scoffs] I'll say.

25:36.228 --> 25:38.262
And there we were, the two of us,

25:38.264 --> 25:40.264
out in the field.

25:40.266 --> 25:45.035
The hot summer rain soaked us to the skin.

25:45.037 --> 25:48.305
Oh, my God, it hurts
just to think about it.

25:48.307 --> 25:51.375
Why, Ronnie, why?

25:51.377 --> 25:52.710
[Clears throat]

25:52.712 --> 25:55.279
Look, I'm out of that apple crap.

25:55.281 --> 25:56.814
So you want another round,

25:56.816 --> 25:58.849
you're gonna have to switch
to a big-boy drink.

25:58.851 --> 25:59.950
Okay, thanks.

25:59.952 --> 26:03.353
[Sighs]

26:03.355 --> 26:06.623
Oh!

26:06.625 --> 26:10.828
Well, I guess this would be yours now.

26:13.965 --> 26:15.699
Uhn! Oh!

26:15.701 --> 26:16.867
Would you mind taking that, sir?

26:16.869 --> 26:18.135
Unh! Oh!

26:18.137 --> 26:19.870
[Grunts, groans]

26:21.906 --> 26:24.374
Go home, appleseed.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.243
And pick up that blood.

26:26.245 --> 26:31.014
[Stifled groans]

26:35.920 --> 26:37.921
And after that, he left.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.960
Thank you.

26:42.962 --> 26:46.463
That was very... Descriptive.

26:48.633 --> 26:50.834
Poor guy.

26:50.836 --> 26:53.303
She broke his heart.

26:53.305 --> 26:54.872
Why wouldn't he tell us?

26:54.874 --> 26:56.840
[Sighs] 'Cause we're not friends.

26:56.842 --> 26:58.976
Evan, don't be like that.
Of course we are.

26:58.978 --> 27:00.911
No, no, I'm not. It's him. He...

27:00.913 --> 27:04.281
he's a hopeless romantic is what he is.

27:04.283 --> 27:06.416
You have to hire him back.

27:09.554 --> 27:13.690
[Horns honking]

27:13.692 --> 27:15.292
If this is what a bitter divorce gets me,

27:15.294 --> 27:17.394
maybe I shouldn't be so bitter.

27:17.396 --> 27:19.396
Exactly. This fight is
letting your ex-wife

27:19.398 --> 27:21.565
take your health too.

27:21.567 --> 27:23.167
Well, she should get something.

27:23.169 --> 27:25.803
I wasn't the perfect husband.

27:25.805 --> 27:27.671
Always running out to see patients,

27:27.673 --> 27:30.207
bringing them home without asking...

27:30.209 --> 27:31.642
Adopting them.

27:31.644 --> 27:35.579
What she did was unforgivable.

27:35.581 --> 27:40.117
Of course I fought like an alley cat.

27:40.119 --> 27:42.820
If only we could all be
as selfless as guide horses.

27:45.056 --> 27:47.090
Or dogs.

27:47.092 --> 27:51.094
Hey, Tom, did that farm
just train horses for the blind?

27:51.096 --> 27:52.462
What do you mean?

27:52.464 --> 27:54.798
I mean, are you asking
if they work with other animals,

27:54.800 --> 27:56.266
[begins slurring]
or other medical conditions or...

27:56.268 --> 27:58.268
Tom, you're slurring your words.

27:58.270 --> 28:00.304
Maybe the cow hit a facial nerve.

28:00.306 --> 28:01.839
It looks like Bell's palsy.

28:01.841 --> 28:04.708
Can you wrinkle your forehead?

28:04.710 --> 28:05.976
Okay, that's not Bell's palsy.

28:05.978 --> 28:08.745
Tom, you're having a stroke.

28:11.516 --> 28:13.851
Come on, people! Move!

28:16.329 --> 28:17.529
All right, we can't sit in this.

28:17.531 --> 28:18.930
Beulah did this?

28:18.932 --> 28:20.231
Maybe the malabsorption disorder.

28:20.233 --> 28:21.967
Maybe neither.

28:21.969 --> 28:24.469
Arthropathy, weight loss,
fever, gingivitis,

28:24.471 --> 28:25.837
and now a stroke.

28:25.839 --> 28:27.472
Tom, I think you have Whipple's disease.

28:27.474 --> 28:29.040
Isn't that a bacterial infection?

28:29.042 --> 28:32.644
Yeah. And a serious one.

28:32.646 --> 28:34.746
Hank? Hank, what are you doing?

28:34.748 --> 28:37.048
We have to get to the hospital right now.

28:37.050 --> 28:38.350
Lowering a stroke victim's
core temperature

28:38.352 --> 28:40.819
can reduce the metabolic
activity of the brain.

28:40.821 --> 28:44.055
- Hank, where are you...
- I'm gonna buy you some time.

28:44.057 --> 28:47.492
Medical emergency! Excuse me, please!

28:47.494 --> 28:48.860
Sir?

28:53.666 --> 28:55.934
Hey, guys, come on in.

28:55.936 --> 28:58.036
Come on in. Let's go.

28:58.038 --> 29:00.538
- You grab his feet.
- All right.

29:00.540 --> 29:01.706
Hey, doc, you got my thrombolytics?

29:01.708 --> 29:03.274
Standing by.

29:03.276 --> 29:04.609
We also need to get him on bactrim.

29:04.611 --> 29:07.012
- For a CVA?
- For Whipple's disease.

29:07.014 --> 29:08.580
I thought that was
just something they used

29:08.582 --> 29:10.048
to trip kids up with at med school.

29:10.050 --> 29:12.484
Yeah, first case I've seen too.

29:14.520 --> 29:20.191
Hey... That'll be $727.50.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.893
And it would help if you got exact change.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.799
This is gonna help with diabetes?

29:27.801 --> 29:30.068
This is Stanley.

29:30.070 --> 29:32.103
[Translates in Russian]

29:32.105 --> 29:33.204
You said you don't want an implant?

29:33.206 --> 29:34.606
Well, you can't implant the dog.

29:34.608 --> 29:36.541
[Translates in Russian]

29:36.543 --> 29:39.744
A dog's nose has around
200 million scent receptors.

29:39.746 --> 29:41.413
They can detect even
the most subtle odors.

29:41.415 --> 29:45.050
[Translates in russian]
Bombs, drugs, cadavers.

29:45.052 --> 29:47.719
Well, Stanley here
has been trained to detect

29:47.721 --> 29:50.388
what a diabetic smells like
when his glucose gets too high

29:50.390 --> 29:51.723
or too low.

29:54.493 --> 29:57.128
It's a joke, right?

29:57.130 --> 29:59.097
Not possible.

29:59.099 --> 30:01.132
He doesn't think you can do it.

30:01.134 --> 30:05.070
[Dog whimpers, barks]

30:05.072 --> 30:07.138
Stanley says he can prove it.

30:07.140 --> 30:10.375
[Laughs]

30:10.377 --> 30:11.910
Good luck.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.320
The bartender told us everything.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.788
We know about Ronnie.

30:23.790 --> 30:27.225
[Sighs]

30:32.031 --> 30:34.799
Thanks.

30:34.801 --> 30:36.968
Why didn't you tell us?

30:36.970 --> 30:39.604
Because you would have made fun of me.

30:39.606 --> 30:40.805
No, we wouldn't.

30:40.807 --> 30:43.508
Dude, we've all been there.

30:43.510 --> 30:46.277
No, not like this. This is different.

30:46.279 --> 30:49.314
You guys, what am I gonna do?

30:49.316 --> 30:51.149
I love her so much.

30:51.151 --> 30:52.984
Of course you do.

30:52.986 --> 30:55.120
I don't want to let her go.

30:55.122 --> 30:57.455
Of course you don't.

30:57.457 --> 31:00.625
But I also know that's crazy.

31:00.627 --> 31:01.926
She is 15.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.628
Of course... what?

31:03.630 --> 31:06.064
Fired! Fired, fired, fired!

31:06.066 --> 31:07.899
Hold on. So she's <i>15?</i>

31:07.901 --> 31:09.501
Yeah.

31:09.503 --> 31:11.936
And most rabbits only live,
like, 8 to 12 years.

31:11.938 --> 31:14.339
- Rabbits?
- Hold on, I'm sorry.

31:14.341 --> 31:16.274
Ronnie is not a girl
who broke up with you?

31:16.276 --> 31:18.743
A girl? No. What?

31:18.745 --> 31:20.845
You said the bartender
told you everything.

31:20.847 --> 31:24.582
Uh, apparently he left some stuff out.

31:24.584 --> 31:27.385
Like the fact that you own a bunny...

31:27.387 --> 31:28.787
[Chuckles]

31:28.789 --> 31:30.488
And that's the love of your li... life.

31:30.490 --> 31:31.890
[Giggles] Sorry.

31:31.892 --> 31:34.959
Okay, see, this is why I didn't tell you.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.194
- No, no, no. No.
- We're sorry.

31:36.196 --> 31:37.362
- Yeah.
- Really, we're... we are.

31:37.364 --> 31:38.596
We're being insensitive.

31:38.598 --> 31:40.198
It's just, you know, when you think about

31:40.200 --> 31:43.368
what drives a man to drink,
it's usually not a bun...

31:43.370 --> 31:44.502
a bunny. [Laughter]

31:44.504 --> 31:46.805
I told you, she's 15. That's old!

31:46.807 --> 31:48.973
She can't see, she can't hear.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.975
She's always hopping into stuff.

31:50.977 --> 31:54.112
And she's not just a bunny, okay?

31:54.114 --> 31:57.148
She was a present from a girl
I was in love with

31:57.150 --> 31:59.651
a long time ago.

31:59.653 --> 32:01.519
Pam.

32:01.521 --> 32:03.988
That's really sweet.

32:03.990 --> 32:07.158
Yeah, until she ended it.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.861
And even though I know
the right thing to do

32:09.863 --> 32:11.462
is to put her down, I just...

32:11.464 --> 32:13.531
I keep losing my nerve.

32:13.533 --> 32:15.233
The bunny, right? Not the...

32:15.235 --> 32:16.334
The bunny. The bunny.

32:16.336 --> 32:19.070
And that is why I went to the bar...

32:19.072 --> 32:21.773
for... liquid courage.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.211
So where is she now?

32:26.213 --> 32:29.247
[Straining] Hey. Hey, Ronnie, come here.

32:29.249 --> 32:31.983
Come here, girl. [Smooches]

32:31.985 --> 32:34.519
Hi. Good bunny.

32:34.521 --> 32:36.621
It's okay, no one's gonna hurt you.

32:36.623 --> 32:40.592
She knows that's not true.
That's why she's hiding.

32:40.594 --> 32:43.928
Hey.

32:43.930 --> 32:46.531
Okay.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.701
All right...

32:51.904 --> 32:55.073
[Dry spits]

32:55.075 --> 32:58.443
So... Here's the good news.

32:58.445 --> 33:01.846
You don't need to put her down anymore.

33:01.848 --> 33:04.916
[Quiet gasp]

33:04.918 --> 33:07.719
Oh...

33:23.535 --> 33:26.137
[Instrument beeps]

33:26.139 --> 33:27.705
Yep, your glucose is slightly high.

33:27.707 --> 33:29.107
Mm-hmm.

33:29.109 --> 33:31.876
Now let's take it higher.

33:31.878 --> 33:33.645
Are you sure that's wise, Hank?

33:33.647 --> 33:35.246
We can't risk any further delay.

33:35.248 --> 33:36.848
It's okay.

33:36.850 --> 33:39.117
If you approach ketoacidosis,
you're hooked up to insulin,

33:39.119 --> 33:41.419
but I don't think Stanley
will let it get that far.

33:41.421 --> 33:42.820
Or you could just trust me on that

33:42.822 --> 33:44.522
and get to your meeting on time.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.796
[Clears throat]
Hey, <i>sobaka...</i>

33:51.798 --> 33:53.231
<i>Na zdorovie.</i>

33:56.802 --> 33:59.270
Ahh.

33:59.272 --> 34:00.738
How are you feeling?

34:00.740 --> 34:04.275
Uh, not fantastic, thank you.

34:05.611 --> 34:08.980
Maybe your dog is broken.

34:14.987 --> 34:18.956
[Dog barks, whimpers, barks]

34:18.958 --> 34:20.658
He says your blood sugar is too high.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.628
[Laughs] Fantastic!

34:23.630 --> 34:27.764
[Speaking Russian]

34:27.766 --> 34:31.768
Well, uh... "Son of a bitch."

34:31.771 --> 34:34.172
Technically true, but
I think he prefers "Stanley."

34:34.174 --> 34:35.572
Stanley.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.241
So once you get a dog, you start training.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.476
So if you're interested, you should apply

34:38.478 --> 34:40.244
as soon as possible. But I like this one.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.947
And he seems to like you,
but that's not how it works.

34:42.949 --> 34:45.248
I was only able to borrow him
because of this vet I treated.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.650
I take this one.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.186
He's kinda like the floor model.

34:48.188 --> 34:49.920
Can you translate "floor model"?

34:49.922 --> 34:52.790
[Speaks Russian]
[Repeats in Russian]

34:52.792 --> 34:57.762
I take this one.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.538
Well done, Dr. Lawson.

35:07.540 --> 35:08.806
And thank you.

35:08.808 --> 35:11.943
You're welcome. And good luck in there.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.215
Yeah.

35:17.217 --> 35:19.384
[Doors shut]

35:26.589 --> 35:28.256
The weird thing about Whipple's is

35:28.258 --> 35:30.292
it's a bacterial infection
you can't culture.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.893
Which is why it didn't
show up in any of the tests.

35:31.895 --> 35:33.295
But we know for sure now?

35:33.297 --> 35:35.931
Yeah. Your biopsy confirmed it.

35:35.933 --> 35:38.500
At first, the infection was
just causing the malabsorption,

35:38.502 --> 35:41.503
but eventually, bacteria
accumulated in a heart valve,

35:41.505 --> 35:43.405
broke off, and traveled to your brain,

35:43.407 --> 35:44.706
which caused the stroke.

35:44.708 --> 35:46.241
So how'd I get it?

35:46.243 --> 35:48.310
It's found in soil.
[Chuckles]

35:48.312 --> 35:49.878
Well, I work with farm animals,

35:49.880 --> 35:51.613
so that should be easy to avoid.

35:51.615 --> 35:53.248
Look, Tom, it's rare.

35:53.250 --> 35:54.883
And you're gonna be on
antibiotics for at least a year,

35:54.885 --> 35:58.487
so hopefully it won't recur.

35:58.489 --> 36:01.656
Thanks... Both of you.

36:01.658 --> 36:04.059
You are seriously good human beings.

36:04.061 --> 36:05.727
And coming from a guy who prefers animals,

36:05.729 --> 36:06.928
that's saying a lot.

36:06.930 --> 36:09.698
[Chuckles]
You're a good person too.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.366
And I am glad that you changed your mind

36:11.368 --> 36:12.634
about fighting your ex-wife.

36:12.636 --> 36:14.136
What do you mean?

36:14.138 --> 36:16.538
Well, you said that
you were going to stop,

36:16.540 --> 36:17.973
that it wasn't worth it.

36:17.975 --> 36:20.742
Yeah, that's when we thought
it was stress-induced.

36:20.744 --> 36:21.943
You just said it's bacterial.

36:21.945 --> 36:24.146
It is, but the lesson here...

36:24.148 --> 36:25.514
the lesson here is that you can't avoid

36:25.516 --> 36:27.616
random crappy soil bacteria.

36:27.618 --> 36:29.184
Once I'm back up on my feet,

36:29.186 --> 36:31.186
I'm going with both barrels at that harpy.

36:31.188 --> 36:33.755
- Tom?
- One barrel?

36:33.757 --> 36:36.358
All right, no barrels.

36:39.862 --> 36:43.298
Thank you guys for coming.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.133
[Sighs]

36:45.135 --> 36:47.536
Thanks for handling the Van Dyke thing.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.538
You done good.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.706
You're welcome.

36:51.708 --> 36:55.110
I... honestly, I was a little nervous

36:55.112 --> 36:57.112
when you said, "handle it."

36:57.114 --> 36:59.781
I thought you just wanted me to fire him.

36:59.783 --> 37:04.119
I wanted you to handle it, which you did.

37:04.121 --> 37:05.720
One of these days, I really need

37:05.722 --> 37:07.722
to stop worrying so much
about what you think.

37:07.724 --> 37:10.725
No, you don't.
[Chuckles]

37:10.727 --> 37:12.994
- You doing a reading?
- Yeah.

37:12.996 --> 37:14.362
What the hell is Thessalonians, anyway?

37:14.364 --> 37:16.398
I have no idea.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.335
[Clears throat] Um... Oh...

37:20.337 --> 37:23.371
When Pam broke up with me,

37:23.373 --> 37:25.173
I was left with two things:

37:25.175 --> 37:26.942
Her memory...

37:26.944 --> 37:31.379
and... her rabbit.

37:31.381 --> 37:35.584
In fact, at first,
Ronnie was just a memory of Pam.

37:35.586 --> 37:39.554
But eventually, Pam faded.

37:39.556 --> 37:43.391
And today...

37:43.393 --> 37:46.027
Oh...

37:46.029 --> 37:47.162
It's cool, man.

37:47.164 --> 37:48.997
Today... [Clears throat]

37:48.999 --> 37:52.100
Ronnie has become her own memory.

37:52.102 --> 37:57.405
And so I return you now, Ronnie,

37:57.407 --> 37:59.407
from whence you came.

37:59.409 --> 38:01.610
Bunnies don't come from the ocean.

38:01.612 --> 38:02.611
Just roll with it.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.579
Is... is this even legal?

38:04.581 --> 38:05.847
Evan has a permit.

38:05.849 --> 38:07.115
No, I don't.

38:07.117 --> 38:08.517
- You said you applied for one.
- I did.

38:08.519 --> 38:12.454
In six to eight weeks,
we'll see if it was approved.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.756
Hey, Evan, I want to thank you

38:14.758 --> 38:16.825
for being a good boss.

38:16.827 --> 38:21.496
But more importantly,

38:21.498 --> 38:23.865
for being a friend.

38:27.169 --> 38:29.704
Absolutely, man.

38:29.706 --> 38:30.805
All right.

38:30.807 --> 38:34.175
So, uh... Even though I didn't...

38:34.177 --> 38:36.211
I didn't really know Ronnie very well,

38:36.213 --> 38:38.113
I thought I'd just, uh...

38:38.115 --> 38:41.082
"we do not want you to be unaware,"

38:41.084 --> 38:43.018
"brothers and sisters..."

38:43.020 --> 38:44.386
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but there's a lifeguard

38:44.388 --> 38:46.922
staring at us.

38:46.924 --> 38:48.490
Is there a problem?

38:48.492 --> 38:51.026
Only if we get caught.
This is technically illegal.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.093
It's a lifeguard. What's he gonna do,

38:52.095 --> 38:53.428
make us take swim lessons?

38:53.430 --> 38:55.797
Or point us out to a cop,
like he's doing now.

38:55.799 --> 38:57.799
My father's running for senate.

38:57.801 --> 38:59.134
I can't get arrested for this.

38:59.136 --> 39:00.201
All right, scatter. Everyone scatter.

39:00.203 --> 39:01.870
But casually... casually scatter.

39:01.872 --> 39:04.472
[Siren wails]
Come on!

39:04.474 --> 39:06.908
Forget casually, just run!

39:08.644 --> 39:10.879
Okay.

39:10.881 --> 39:13.214
Good-bye, Ronnie!

39:15.952 --> 39:18.620
[Shredder whirring]

39:20.423 --> 39:23.058
Yep.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.893
I thought we were going out.

39:24.895 --> 39:26.561
We are. I thought
we could get a drink first.

39:26.563 --> 39:28.430
- With Boris?
- Uh, no.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.632
Boris and Dmitry are
celebrating on Boris' yacht.

39:30.634 --> 39:32.601
Apparently, international deals call for

39:32.603 --> 39:34.469
international waters.

39:34.471 --> 39:36.671
So where are we going?

39:36.673 --> 39:38.406
You'll see.

39:45.815 --> 39:47.816
[Laughs]

39:47.818 --> 39:50.852
- Narnia?
- No, not Narnia.

39:50.854 --> 39:52.921
I feel like I might be hot.

39:52.923 --> 39:55.357
Trust me. You're gonna be fine.

39:55.359 --> 39:57.792
But it's summer.

39:57.794 --> 40:00.128
Not in there.

40:00.130 --> 40:03.264
[Chuckles, shivers]

40:03.266 --> 40:06.368
- It's chilly in here.
- I know.

40:06.370 --> 40:09.004
All right, here we go.

40:09.006 --> 40:11.473
[Light switch clicks]

40:11.475 --> 40:14.342
[Laughs, gasps]

40:14.344 --> 40:18.179
- Holy...
- I know.

40:18.181 --> 40:19.581
This used to be a meat locker

40:19.583 --> 40:21.783
till Boris had it converted for Dmitry.

40:21.785 --> 40:24.486
So then why are we in here,
and they're out on a boat?

40:24.488 --> 40:26.721
Because given his liver and his diabetes,

40:26.723 --> 40:29.724
Dmitry wisely chose the fish
over the vodka.

40:29.726 --> 40:32.127
But that's no reason we can't enjoy it.

40:32.129 --> 40:33.895
Please, step up to my bar.

40:33.897 --> 40:35.030
[Chuckles]

40:35.032 --> 40:37.732
You, uh... you have a favorite?

40:37.734 --> 40:40.702
Um... Oh.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.071
You can't buy this.

40:43.073 --> 40:44.539
This is what Khrushchev used to serve

40:44.541 --> 40:46.207
to visiting dignitaries.

40:46.209 --> 40:47.942
Yeah?

40:47.944 --> 40:49.644
So let's dignify it.
