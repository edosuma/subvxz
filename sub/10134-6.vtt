Okay, Michelle now

00:04.755 --> 00:06.757
the key to house hockey is..

00:06.799 --> 00:09.134
...no high-sticking,

00:06.799 --> 00:09.134
no cross-checking.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.970

08:32.887 --> 08:36.308
And special helpers

08:32.887 --> 08:36.308

08:36.350 --> 08:38.685

Uncle Jesse, you get to sit

08:56.077 --> 08:59.580

Uncle Jesse can

09:35.616 --> 09:38.412
sing like Elvis.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.787
Wonderful.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.123
Why don't you play

09:39.829 --> 09:42.123

09:42.165 --> 09:46.044
Uh, I don't think the king

09:42.165 --> 09:46.044

10:05.939 --> 10:07.774
There's no stealing

10:05.939 --> 10:07.774

10:07.815 --> 10:09.859
Keep that up, and you'll

10:07.815 --> 10:09.859
end up in magic prison.

They also have to learn

13:31.894 --> 13:33.812
that violence

13:31.894 --> 13:33.812
is not the answer.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.148

that anybody

13:35.189 --> 13:36.524
can just come up

13:35.189 --> 13:36.524

out of that place.

that you're upset

He's out of his mind.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.457
Tell him, honey.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.500
They were going to make

15:57.498 --> 15:59.500
Michelle sit in the corner.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.088
- And then?

16:02.086 --> 16:04.088
- That's it.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.884
You're right.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.884
He's out of his mind.

16:07.926 --> 16:08.927
You guys weren't there,

16:07.926 --> 16:08.927
this little kid

16:08.968 --> 16:10.553
was bugging her all morning.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.472
I told her to stick up for

16:10.595 --> 16:12.472
herself and the kid pinched her

16:12.513 --> 16:15.600
so she pinched him back,

16:12.513 --> 16:15.600
a real good one, too.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.101
Oh, that's a great lesson.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.478
Oh, it worked

16:17.143 --> 16:18.478
for me as a kid.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.354
An eye for an eye,

16:18.519 --> 16:20.354
a pinch for a pinch.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.816
It's only way you can survive

16:20.396 --> 16:22.816
out there on those streets.

16:22.857 --> 16:26.736
What streets? Michelle's not

16:22.857 --> 16:26.736
allowed out of the backyard.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.071
Hey, I just want the kid to

16:26.778 --> 16:29.071
learn to stand up for herself.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.907
Well, so do I but

16:29.113 --> 16:30.907
that's no reason to pull her

16:30.949 --> 16:32.700
out of school without

16:30.949 --> 16:32.700
consulting me first.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.494
I thought I was living here

16:32.742 --> 16:34.494
to help my nieces.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.496
Those nieces just happen

16:34.535 --> 16:36.496
to be my daughters.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.872
Oh, so what am I?

16:36.537 --> 16:37.872
Just hired help or something?

16:37.914 --> 16:39.332
Okay, I'll go

16:37.914 --> 16:39.332
cook dinner for..

16:39.373 --> 16:40.875
What would you like?

16:39.373 --> 16:40.875
Chicken or pork chops?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.209
I hate to make

16:40.917 --> 16:42.209
such a big decision

16:42.251 --> 16:44.086
without consulting

16:42.251 --> 16:44.086
the king first.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.422
Jess, just cook

16:44.128 --> 16:46.422
whatever you want.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.299
I-I do kind of feel

16:46.464 --> 16:48.299
like chicken, though.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.636
Oh.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.353
Oh, it's childproof.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.780
Joey, I'm freaking out.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.783
Kimmy's horoscope said,

17:10.822 --> 17:13.783
I'd have an unpleasant surprise

17:13.825 --> 17:15.034
and it happened.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.202
Instead of pizza

17:16.243 --> 17:18.705
the cafeteria

17:16.243 --> 17:18.705
served pimento loaf.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.248
It was like eating

17:18.746 --> 17:21.248
baloney with eyes.

[mumbling]

17:26.963 --> 17:28.923
Joey, I can't

17:26.963 --> 17:28.923
understand you.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.426
Hey, wait a second.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.929
"A misunderstanding

17:32.468 --> 17:34.929
will occur at home."

17:34.971 --> 17:36.764
I'm at home.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.808
I'm misunderstanding you.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.727
I'm freaking out again.

[water gushing]

18:07.795 --> 18:10.673
Kimmy, what do you think about

18:07.795 --> 18:10.673
this for next week's editorial?

18:10.715 --> 18:13.092
"Tardiness, are we really late?

18:13.133 --> 18:15.636
Or does class start

18:13.133 --> 18:15.636
just a bit too early?"

18:22.810 --> 18:23.978
What are you doing?

18:24.020 --> 18:25.980
Practicing for

18:24.020 --> 18:25.980
the nerd Olympics?

18:27.607 --> 18:31.069
Kimmy, everything

18:27.607 --> 18:31.069
in your horoscope came true.

18:31.110 --> 18:35.448
Now it says to exercise

18:31.110 --> 18:35.448
extreme caution after dark.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.618
That's why I'm sleeping

18:35.489 --> 18:38.618
with Michelle's night light.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.245
Well, I guess I better

18:38.659 --> 18:41.245
tell you the truth, kid.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.122
I don't know anything

18:41.287 --> 18:43.122
about astrology.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.833
I just copied those horoscopes

18:43.163 --> 18:45.833
out of old newspapers.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.336
You mean, thanks

18:47.376 --> 18:49.336
to this woman

18:49.378 --> 18:53.382
I spent my whole day

18:49.378 --> 18:53.382
freaking out over nothing?

18:54.675 --> 18:56.176
How rude.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.933
Hey, you stole

18:59.305 --> 19:01.933
my clown light.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.184
Michelle, I just needed

19:01.975 --> 19:04.184
to borrow it.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.229
That's mine.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.229
You're in big trouble, mister.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.109
- Ow.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.109
- What's going on in here?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.777
Did you see what

19:11.150 --> 19:12.777
Michelle just did?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.445
No.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.445
Michelle, what did you do?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.155
I did this.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.698
Ow.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.076
Michelle, stop

19:17.740 --> 19:20.076
pinching Stephanie.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.201
You said I could.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.829
No. No.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.829
That was different.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.623
I-I said you could before

19:22.870 --> 19:25.623
because Aaron took your cookie.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.042
Stephanie took my lamp.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.962
Yeah, but in one case, somebody

19:28.084 --> 19:30.962
took something that was yours.

19:31.004 --> 19:34.090
But in the other case,

19:31.004 --> 19:34.090
somebody took something that..

19:34.132 --> 19:35.508
...was yours.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.843
Oh, boy.

19:39.137 --> 19:42.181
Give it back, or you're

19:39.137 --> 19:42.181
getting it again.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,

19:42.222 --> 19:44.224

19:44.266 --> 19:46.185
Put away those pinchers.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.311
Come on.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.311
Follow me.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.813
We're going to my room.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.900
I'll be back

19:50.481 --> 19:52.900
for the clown.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.446
Alright, Michelle...

19:55.486 --> 19:57.446
we have to have one

19:57.488 --> 19:59.657
of our world famous talks.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.536
[sighs]

19:59.699 --> 20:03.536
Now...I'm not

19:59.699 --> 20:03.536
very happy about it

20:03.577 --> 20:06.622
but, uh, your Uncle Jesse

20:03.577 --> 20:06.622
was wrong today.

20:08.916 --> 20:12.378
I know.

20:08.916 --> 20:12.378
I'm as shocked as you are.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.589
But I lost my cool today

20:12.419 --> 20:15.589
and I acted like a big jerk.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.257
No problem.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.301
Well, it is a problem.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.845
See, Michelle, when

20:19.343 --> 20:20.845
I was a kid, I used to get

20:20.887 --> 20:22.889
into a lot of fights

20:20.887 --> 20:22.889
and looking back

20:22.930 --> 20:25.766
I kind of realize I handled

20:22.930 --> 20:25.766
those fights all wrong.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.101
Should've led

20:25.808 --> 20:27.101
with my jab, huh.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.145
No.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.145
Just kidding.

20:29.187 --> 20:31.105
Uh, I'm not proud

20:29.187 --> 20:31.105
of those fights.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.107
No problem.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.942
Well, what I should've

20:33.149 --> 20:34.942
said today was

20:34.984 --> 20:36.485
that if you have a problem,

20:34.984 --> 20:36.485
you should try to solve it

20:36.527 --> 20:39.238
with words, like-like

20:36.527 --> 20:39.238
"Knock it off"

20:39.279 --> 20:42.783
or the ever popular

20:39.279 --> 20:42.783
"Buzz off, bucko."

20:42.825 --> 20:44.326
And if that doesn't work

20:42.825 --> 20:44.326
you should try to find

20:44.368 --> 20:46.328
a parent or teacher

20:44.368 --> 20:46.328
to help you.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.373
But absolutely

20:46.370 --> 20:49.373
no hitting or pinching.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.541
<i>Capisce?</i>

20:50.583 --> 20:53.169
<i>Capisce.</i>

20:50.583 --> 20:53.169
No more pinching.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.256
Jess, I called Mrs. Manning

20:57.297 --> 20:59.133
and I straightened

20:57.297 --> 20:59.133
everything out.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.343
Michelle, you're going back

20:59.175 --> 21:01.343
to school tomorrow.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.805
Okay, but it's Saturday.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.724
Make that Monday, then.

21:06.766 --> 21:10.103
Danny, uh, I straightened a few

21:06.766 --> 21:10.103
things out with Michelle.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.646
Michelle, tell your daddy

21:10.144 --> 21:12.646
what you learned today.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.733
Uncle Jesse is a big jerk.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.277
You taught her that?

21:18.318 --> 21:19.987
No. I didn't teach

21:18.318 --> 21:19.987
her that.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.447
Well, actually, yeah.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.447
Yeah, I did teach her that.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.783
But I taught her

21:21.488 --> 21:23.783
no pinching.

21:23.824 --> 21:26.493
That's what

21:23.824 --> 21:26.493
I taught her.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.579
Danny, I'm sorry.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.579
I owe you an apology.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.206
I should've talked to you

21:28.621 --> 21:30.206
about all this stuff

21:30.248 --> 21:32.583
before I turned Michelle

21:30.248 --> 21:32.583
into a preschool dropout.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.960
That's okay, Jess.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.003
I know you were just

21:34.001 --> 21:36.003
trying to protect her.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.714
Well, I just wish there was some

21:36.045 --> 21:38.714
way I could make it up to you.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.135
You know what? There is.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.135
You are a very lucky man.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.552
Because I told the school

21:42.176 --> 21:43.552
you're going to be

21:43.594 --> 21:46.639
the special helper

21:43.594 --> 21:46.639
all next week.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.059
Isn't that good news,

21:48.474 --> 21:50.059
Michelle?

21:50.101 --> 21:53.854
That makes me

21:50.101 --> 21:53.854
very happy.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.107
Come here, honey.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.107
Oh, boy.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.858
You're going to have fun

21:56.149 --> 21:57.858
in preschool next week.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.318
You're gonna play guitar

21:57.900 --> 21:59.318
for the kids

21:59.359 --> 22:00.903
'You know, do one Elvis song

21:59.359 --> 22:00.903
and then you can'

22:00.945 --> 22:02.155
'sit in one of those

22:00.945 --> 22:02.155
little chairs.'

22:02.196 --> 22:03.697
Oh, it's great.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.574

22:03.739 --> 22:05.574
with the kids.
