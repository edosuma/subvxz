WEBVTT

00:48.673 --> 00:49.799
This doesn't work.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.968
Looks like your dad blocked it.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.057
To be honest,

00:57.265 --> 00:59.976
I can pay you for all the help
I've gotten from you.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.811
But I can't hire you.

01:02.103 --> 01:06.316
I really can't afford it.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.526
Why did you have to pack up
and leave the house?

01:08.610 --> 01:11.029
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
<i>MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY</i> BY KI MAENG-GI

01:11.112 --> 01:12.572
I don't even know anymore.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.241
Can I go to a housewarming party
empty-handed?

01:18.703 --> 01:20.663
Give me one of those
instead of payment.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.002
Whose housewarming party?

01:26.795 --> 01:28.213
A senior in my department.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.639
It's not brand new,
but it was bought recently.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.192
-What? Are you lending it to me?
-No.

01:50.819 --> 01:51.653
It's a gift.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.874
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.877
We'll do it. You should have some too.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.170
I'll do it.
Don't worry about me and eat up.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.048
How manly.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.800
Thank you for the food.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.641
-I'll do it.
-Don't worry. It's okay.

02:21.724 --> 02:22.642
Give me that.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.021
Look at this.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.232
He even cut the meat
into bite-sized pieces.

02:30.024 --> 02:30.900
Yes.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.210
Are you making noodles?

02:55.133 --> 02:55.967
I'll just do it.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.095
You should eat. Eat up.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.606
I'll hold on to the TV for now.
Take it back whenever you need it.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.773
It's too much.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.192
Do you not watch TV?

03:12.275 --> 03:14.736
I can watch shows on my phone
to save the fee.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.238
Me neither.
But she wants to have one.

03:17.822 --> 03:18.656
What?

03:19.157 --> 03:21.409
Mi-rae is so thrifty, it's annoying.

03:21.492 --> 03:22.994
When we buy daily necessities,

03:23.077 --> 03:25.705
she has to buy them online
at the cheapest prices.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.832
Me too. I only buy things on hot deals.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.792
Me too. A flash sale every morning.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.628
The weekly special sale is cheaper.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.214
Well, bulk deals are way cheaper.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.508
-A bundle of bottled waters is 1,500 won.
-Are you serious?

03:39.093 --> 03:42.388
Then let's place orders together
when we don't have much to buy.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.349
Great! Then shipping will be free.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.394
You two are so excited.

03:48.478 --> 03:52.148
You'll get 50 percent off for a movie
on the last Wednesday of each month.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.109
You're so impressive.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.322
No. I'm broke, so I have to be frugal.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.701
I went for buy-1-get-1-free deals
at a convenience store.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.456
When you buy one,
you get another one for free.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.007
What a downer.

04:23.805 --> 04:24.847
Isn't that a guitar?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.270
Can you play the guitar?

04:30.353 --> 04:31.729
A little. It's my hobby.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.773
-Show us.
-Yes, please.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.733
I'm not good enough.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.278
-Show us.
-Show us.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.906
-Show us.
-Show us.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.866
I'll show you later.

04:46.828 --> 04:47.662
Please.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.678
Leave it. I'll do it later.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.513
I can finish this quickly.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.189
I'll do it.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.786
-Shall we take the garbage out?
-Yes.

06:19.128 --> 06:22.965
Kyung-seok is very different from
what I thought he'd be like.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.344
-He gets along with people well.
-Did he used to be prickly?

06:26.427 --> 06:29.764
I wouldn't say he was "prickly" per se.
How should I put it?

06:30.056 --> 06:31.933
Shall I say he was unapproachable?

06:32.934 --> 06:35.520
I can't believe a guy like that
remembered Mi-rae.

06:35.603 --> 06:36.604
I was so surprised.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.616
<i>I get that he hates his mom,</i>
<i>but she's hospitalized.</i>

06:49.742 --> 06:51.536
<i>He could visit her at least once.</i>

06:51.953 --> 06:53.788
<i>Why did he come here instead?</i>

07:02.255 --> 07:03.756
You still haven't opened that?

07:23.192 --> 07:24.318
I'll do it.

07:28.739 --> 07:31.325
Let's meet up often
since we're neighbors now.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.120
How about a movie
on the last Wednesday of every month?

07:34.829 --> 07:36.456
-I'd love that.
-Me too.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.087
Mi-rae. We need to watch a movie as well.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.803
It's our assignment
for Studies on Pop Culture.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.224
Oh, right.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.392
Let's do it together.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.522
<i>It's just an assignment,</i>
<i>so it'd be weird to turn him down.</i>

08:02.899 --> 08:03.733
Sure.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.822
You need to write a report on it,
don't you?

08:09.906 --> 08:11.032
Make it long.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.659
The professor would give long reports
good grades.

08:14.994 --> 08:15.912
Thank you.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.246
I knew that.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.249
I already heard.

08:31.636 --> 08:35.847
<i>Does he want to watch the movie</i>
<i>with just me or with other friends?</i>

08:47.276 --> 08:48.319
See you.

08:49.904 --> 08:53.241
-Let's meet up after school tomorrow.
-Okay, sure.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.118
-My class finishes at 4:00 p.m.
-My last class is at--

08:56.202 --> 08:57.453
Aren't you done by 5:00 p.m.?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.580
Yes, my class finishes at 5:00 p.m.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.208
Then I'll wait.

09:03.000 --> 09:03.876
Okay.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.379
<i>What?</i>
<i>Is it going to be just the two of us?</i>

09:08.464 --> 09:10.633
-Where do you guys live?
-We live up there.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.638
See you.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.722
Bye.

09:18.474 --> 09:19.475
Bye.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.162
They live really nearby.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.382
I'm so happy for you, Mi-rae.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.634
Your first time watching a movie
with a guy.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.886
On top of that, with a handsome guy.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.097
We're just doing our assignment.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.724
Do you think...

10:00.725 --> 10:02.852
Kyung-seok likes you?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.479
Not a chance!

10:05.563 --> 10:08.316
What do you think about him?
Are you not interested?

10:08.399 --> 10:10.276
Fine, I'm interested in him. Okay?

10:10.359 --> 10:12.445
Today is our first day of dating.
So what?

10:12.528 --> 10:16.365
My gosh, you touched your feet
with those hands. Stop it.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.161
-My gosh.
-Move.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.038
Hey, hurry up and wash up.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.373
Stop touching me with your feet. Stop it.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.291
Go and wash up.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.169
I'll wash first.

10:42.016 --> 10:45.227
<i>Let's meet at Sinchon Cinetown</i>
<i>at 6:00 p.m.</i>

10:48.105 --> 10:48.981
<i>What?</i>

10:49.940 --> 10:51.817
<i>This really feels like a date.</i>

11:08.125 --> 11:09.835
I think my business is failing.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.673
Do you want to skip classes tomorrow
and go to the beach?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.592
I have plans to watch a movie.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.678
A movie? With who?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.888
I need to do my assignment for my class.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.349
You must have money for tickets.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.396
-No, I don't.
-What?

11:28.479 --> 11:30.815
I don't have money. Lend me some.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.068
My gosh, how did you end up penniless?

11:36.195 --> 11:37.279
Here.

11:40.991 --> 11:41.867
Lend me 50,000 won.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.536
What are you talking about?

11:43.619 --> 11:45.579
I need money for popcorn and dinner.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.081
Popcorn, my foot.

11:47.498 --> 11:48.708
It's a date, isn't it?

11:49.875 --> 11:52.086
-It's just an assignment.
-Sure, it is.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.508
Hey, stop it.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.479
FIRST MOVIE WATCHING
WITH A GUY

12:19.488 --> 12:24.285
IT'S A DATE

12:26.871 --> 12:28.289
It's not a date.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.915
It's just an assignment.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.758
IT'S A DATE

12:39.425 --> 12:40.426
Just an assignment.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.678
Let's see how this looks.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.650
Hey, I...

12:57.234 --> 12:59.069
I need to go to the bookstore.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.071
I forgot to buy some books.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.323
Should I go with you?

13:02.406 --> 13:04.366
No, it's okay.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.411
You... You need to get to class.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.370
Go first.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.706
Okay, I'll see you later.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.749
Okay.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.334
Oh, I almost forgot.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.129
Will you be late?
Watching a movie with Kyung-seok.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.051
I'm going to go home
as soon as the movie ends.

13:22.134 --> 13:25.554
What? Were you also planning to do
some other stuff?

13:27.556 --> 13:28.474
Gosh, just go.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.189
Mi-rae, you can come home late.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.400
Just go.
We're only going to watch a movie.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.332
Anything you need?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.168
I'm looking for pink lipstick.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.128
The lipsticks are placed over here.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.506
You know, there are many different kinds.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.550
There's salmon pink, coral pink,

14:02.633 --> 14:04.677
rose pink, magenta pink
and cherry pink.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.179
Coral pink comes with both pearls
and no pearls.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.098
I see.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.100
Gosh, you look like a peach.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.644
-Pardon?
-Don't you know your fruit?

14:13.727 --> 14:17.189
Joy from Red Velvet looks like an apple,
and Sulli looks like a peach.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.400
-You look like a peach.
-Really?

14:20.150 --> 14:22.486
You must not have a lot of experience
with makeup.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.823
You have a warm undertone
but your makeup is for cool undertones.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.200
I see.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.162
Just wait here.
I'll fix your makeup for you.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.999
Okay, thank you.

14:44.341 --> 14:47.261
<i>Girls start doing makeup</i>
<i>when they enter middle school,</i>

14:48.345 --> 14:50.681
<i>and that's when</i>
<i>they start rolling their bangs.</i>

14:51.557 --> 14:53.434
<i>But I had never done any of that.</i>

14:55.561 --> 14:56.437
What's the brand?

14:56.520 --> 14:59.148
Look at the case. It's so pretty.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.756
<i>I was scared</i>
<i>that others would make fun of my looks</i>

15:24.089 --> 15:26.258
<i>even after I wore makeup</i>
<i>and rolled my hair.</i>

15:29.720 --> 15:31.931
<i>Gosh, you look so pretty!</i>

15:32.598 --> 15:36.226
Let's finish up
by putting some lip gloss on you.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.939
Gosh, you look so pretty and cute.
Have a look in the mirror.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.276
Look in the mirror and smile.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.531
How pretty. You really look like a peach.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.700
You're so pretty.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.163
The cotton pads are 10,000 won.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.040
The cotton pads are 10,000 won?

15:58.123 --> 15:59.416
They're quite pricey.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.336
But if you buy over a certain amount,

16:02.419 --> 16:04.713
you'll be getting a travel kit for free.

16:05.255 --> 16:08.050
This actually costs over 30,000 won

16:08.133 --> 16:11.261
so you'll be saving 15,000 won
if you buy all these.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.568
Why did I buy this?

16:28.779 --> 16:31.824
How many candles do I need to sell?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.745
-Hey.
-Yes?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.331
Can you not tell anyone
about what you saw?

16:39.415 --> 16:40.916
What did I see?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.127
I mean, the day of the after-party.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.923
Tae-young and I are
getting to know each other.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.551
So please keep it a secret for now.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.593
What?

16:52.344 --> 16:55.514
-The fact that I'm dating Tae-young.
-You're dating Tae-young?

16:56.557 --> 16:57.975
Be quiet.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.436
Really? Are you serious?

17:01.186 --> 17:04.272
You... Do you not remember?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.608
I cannot believe this.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.237
Hey, it's a secret. Don't tell anyone.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.489
How did that happen?

17:24.334 --> 17:26.086
I'm not drunk at all.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.173
Okay. So what is this about?

17:29.757 --> 17:33.552
I've never done this in my entire life.
Hear me out and don't laugh at me.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.972
Don't laugh.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.103
I like you.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.318
-I told you not to laugh at me.
-I didn't.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.445
Yes, you did. You laughed.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.448
-I didn't mean it like that.
-My gosh.

17:55.741 --> 17:56.909
That's not it.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.329
You fool.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.127
What are you doing?

18:11.965 --> 18:12.841
Hey, I can't see.

18:14.009 --> 18:14.843
Ye-na.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.345
Well...

18:21.850 --> 18:24.144
-You can't tell anyone, okay?
-I got it.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.489
-Hello.
-Hi.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.120
You got home safely that night, right?

18:42.079 --> 18:44.414
Sorry? Yes.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.874
You got home safely too?

18:45.958 --> 18:49.962
I was busy taking care of the drunk ones.
I didn't get to see you off.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.381
Being the student president is hard,
isn't it?

18:53.674 --> 18:54.925
It's not that hard.

18:56.051 --> 18:59.513
If there's anything I can help you with,
please tell me anytime.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.224
Okay.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.853
Call me when you want
to grab a drink, too.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.398
What?

19:11.275 --> 19:13.443
I'm a huge fan of yours.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.571
Okay.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.073
I see.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.710
Is she sick or something?

19:30.294 --> 19:32.004
No, she's just hungover.

19:32.087 --> 19:35.174
She drank with her old friends
over the weekend.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.720
I'm about to die.
They'd better not come visit me again.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.263
Did many friends come?

19:41.346 --> 19:43.974
Hey, she said six guy friends
came to visit her.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.354
You have a lot of guy friends.

19:49.438 --> 19:53.066
I only have guy friends,
but I don't have a boyfriend.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.860
Is there anyone you like?

19:54.943 --> 19:58.030
I like all of them
but I don't want to date them.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.824
If I want to date them,
I can't stay friends with them.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.706
Help me up, please?

20:12.753 --> 20:15.547
By the way, you look nice today.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.424
What do you mean?

20:17.507 --> 20:19.801
Why didn't you come to the after-party?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.011
You said you'd come.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.597
Something came up that night.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.682
I understand then.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.560
Let's go.

20:32.814 --> 20:35.108
MAKING 500 MILLION WON WITH 50,000 WON

20:45.244 --> 20:47.371
Are you already preparing for the finals?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.251
No, I just needed to read up on something.

20:54.127 --> 20:57.547
You left the after-party early
without saying bye.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.091
Must I say goodbye?

20:59.800 --> 21:00.926
I had to do something.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.848
KANG MI-RAE

21:11.186 --> 21:12.062
Like what?

21:12.145 --> 21:14.273
Something I had to do.

21:18.652 --> 21:21.238
I thought you and I had become friends.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.704
Kyung-seok, do you want to go watch
a movie with me?

21:30.706 --> 21:33.000
Let's do the assignment together.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.752
I'm doing it with someone else.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.839
-Who is it?
-Kang Mi-rae.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.052
I see.

21:51.268 --> 21:55.230
<i>Right now, I'm on my way</i>
<i>to meet a guy friend.</i>

23:00.962 --> 23:01.838
Mi-rae.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.675
What are you doing there?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.013
I didn't see you there.

23:13.850 --> 23:14.810
Which movie?

23:15.852 --> 23:18.146
-I bought the tickets.
-You did?

23:19.231 --> 23:20.273
Good job, buddy.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.944
How much do I owe you?

23:25.028 --> 23:26.113
It's fine.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.249
How can I help you?

23:37.332 --> 23:40.794
-One original combo, please.
-That'll be 8,500 won.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.927
-Why are you paying for everything?
-It's fine.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.720
It's not fine.

24:04.943 --> 24:09.156
Here's 13,250 won.
I'll give you 250 won later.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.491
I said, it's fine.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.410
Quit saying that.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.538
Take it. Friends usually go Dutch.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.221
Too early to go in yet?

24:33.847 --> 24:35.015
We have some time left.

24:39.936 --> 24:44.524
Oh, right. Don't we have to attach
the movie ticket to our report?

24:44.608 --> 24:45.609
Do we have to?

24:46.651 --> 24:47.527
Probably?

24:52.073 --> 24:54.284
-Should I split it in half?
-You'll split it?

25:01.124 --> 25:04.252
Then how about one of us submits
a photo of it?

25:06.213 --> 25:07.422
I'll take a photo, then.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.017
Mi-rae.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.795
Let's get a good mark.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.588
We can do it.

26:05.772 --> 26:07.566
Oh, Sua.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.444
-What are you doing here?
-I came to drop off the pickles I made.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.113
I can take care of myself.

26:21.871 --> 26:24.249
Gosh, don't walk so fast.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.728
The apartment in Dogok-dong...

26:45.562 --> 26:47.230
Was it all a lie?

26:53.153 --> 26:55.280
<i>You can talk like a womanizer.</i>

26:55.363 --> 26:57.574
<i>You were the one who cast a spell on me.</i>

27:03.079 --> 27:05.081
<i>However, you...</i>

27:06.249 --> 27:09.628
<i>What is the message the director wants</i>
<i>to impart through the movie?</i>

27:10.462 --> 27:13.673
<i>Which elements excite the viewers</i>
<i>and can make this movie a hit?</i>

27:14.591 --> 27:17.135
<i>I should pick the most memorable scene.</i>

27:18.219 --> 27:20.555
<i>Which scene would I want to watch again...</i>

27:21.973 --> 27:25.393
<i>No, it's not like you think.</i>

27:25.685 --> 27:27.604
<i>Then why were you hugging each other?</i>

27:28.146 --> 27:31.983
<i>Is it one of those casual relationships?</i>

27:32.525 --> 27:34.319
<i>I'm saying it's not what you think.</i>

27:41.826 --> 27:42.661
<i>Why do I...</i>

27:44.120 --> 27:45.955
<i>keep wanting to look at him?</i>

28:00.804 --> 28:02.138
<i>It must be an instinct.</i>

28:02.847 --> 28:04.265
<i>A basic instinct.</i>

28:14.275 --> 28:16.444
<i>Our eyes are always</i>
<i>drawn to pretty things.</i>

28:17.445 --> 28:19.364
<i>It's not that we have an affection.</i>

28:20.365 --> 28:22.242
<i>We just can't help but stare at them.</i>

28:26.204 --> 28:27.414
<i>Instinctually, that is.</i>

29:01.364 --> 29:02.198
Have some popcorn.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.495
Oh, right.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.209
<i>In most romantic movies, this is when...</i>

29:47.911 --> 29:50.955
<i>This is usually how the plot unfolds.</i>

29:53.374 --> 29:54.250
Please have some.

29:55.877 --> 29:56.878
I will.

30:01.591 --> 30:02.842
<i>What a fuss.</i>

30:03.051 --> 30:07.263
<i>He was always such a snob, and now...</i>

30:09.224 --> 30:12.519
<i>This trick allows you</i>
<i>to prevent such an incident.</i>

30:25.448 --> 30:26.491
What are you doing?

30:28.117 --> 30:30.745
What? You told me to eat popcorn.

30:32.455 --> 30:33.623
I'm eating it now.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.600
It was such a fun movie.

30:53.309 --> 30:54.769
A lot to write about.

30:57.522 --> 30:58.398
I know.

31:01.317 --> 31:03.820
<i>Is it now to part ways?</i>

31:04.612 --> 31:06.948
Aren't you hungry?

31:07.031 --> 31:08.157
What?

31:08.825 --> 31:09.742
Do you like pasta?

31:09.826 --> 31:10.994
Pasta?

31:11.870 --> 31:15.915
<i>Isn't that what people usually eat</i>
<i>on a date?</i>

31:16.791 --> 31:17.917
We can eat something else.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.169
It's okay.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.881
I like everything. I'm an omnivore.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.884
All right, then. Let's go.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.064
This restaurant is so nice.

31:40.148 --> 31:44.110
-Have you been here before?
-No, I found it online.

31:44.193 --> 31:45.945
<i>He looked up restaurants online?</i>

31:46.988 --> 31:48.072
<i>To take me?</i>

31:59.250 --> 32:01.753
I HAVE 37,000 WON LEFT

32:01.836 --> 32:05.381
TWO OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PASTA
DISHES WILL COME TO 28,000 WON IN TOTAL

32:09.427 --> 32:12.764
TWO OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE BEVERAGES
WILL COME TO 12,000 WON IN TOTAL

32:12.847 --> 32:16.100
THE GRAND TOTAL WILL BE 40,000 WON

32:17.143 --> 32:18.269
I'll get aglio e olio.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.566
AGLIO E OLIO: 11,000 WON

32:24.067 --> 32:26.277
TWO SERVINGS OF AGLIO E OLIO EQUAL
22,000 WON

32:26.361 --> 32:28.279
THE GRAND TOTAL WILL BE 34,000 WON

32:29.072 --> 32:30.114
Excuse me.

32:32.533 --> 32:33.993
What would you like to order?

32:34.077 --> 32:36.162
We'll each get aglio e olio pasta and...

32:37.372 --> 32:40.124
-What do you want to drink?
-I'll just stick with water.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.293
Get something else.
I'll get Sprite.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.837
Then I'll get the same.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.506
We'll get two of it, then.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.049
Sure, no problem.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.428
TWO GLASSES OF SODA WILL BE
8,000 WON IN TOTAL

32:52.512 --> 32:54.263
THE GRAND TOTAL WILL BE 30,000 WON

32:54.347 --> 32:56.599
-Did you take a lot of notes earlier?
-What?

32:56.683 --> 33:00.144
You took notes while watching the movie.
Show me what you wrote.

33:03.523 --> 33:06.401
You have to write about
what you thought about the movie.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.236
You shouldn't be influenced.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.947
I never said I'd copy yours.
I'm just curious.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.992
What's there to be curious about?
They're obvious things.

33:15.618 --> 33:16.536
Your handwriting.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.871
I want to see what it looks like.

33:20.164 --> 33:20.999
But why?

33:23.543 --> 33:24.585
I'm just curious.

33:25.962 --> 33:26.963
Do I need a reason?

33:32.510 --> 33:34.512
Excuse me. I have to use the restroom.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.867
<i>Is it possible?</i>

33:57.243 --> 34:00.163
<i>To think of a guy like that</i>
<i>just as a friend.</i>

34:02.665 --> 34:04.417
<i>Can someone like me really do that?</i>

34:12.382 --> 34:14.677
Isn't that guy so handsome?

34:15.011 --> 34:16.179
Totally. Oh, my.

34:16.262 --> 34:19.766
His girlfriend must be super pretty.

34:22.685 --> 34:25.188
-He's really good-looking.
-Unbelievably handsome.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.647
I know, right?

34:35.447 --> 34:37.784
-Why didn't you eat?
-Because you weren't here.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.839
Hey,

34:52.465 --> 34:53.632
When's your birthday?

34:54.300 --> 34:55.217
What?

34:55.802 --> 34:57.470
We're friends, but I don't know it.

34:59.388 --> 35:02.141
You want to know so many things.
Just eat up.

35:03.101 --> 35:07.480
<i>I won't ever let myself get high hopes</i>
<i>by telling him my birthday.</i>

35:14.070 --> 35:15.863
Then don't tell Woo-young either.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.866
-Don't tell him what?
-Your birthday.

36:02.201 --> 36:06.998
I'M SEARCHING FOR A ROOMMATE WHO WANTS
TO LIVE AT A ROOFTOP NEAR OUR SCHOOL

36:12.128 --> 36:14.547
-Let's split the bill.
-It's 30,000 won.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.341
-Here you go.
-Hey.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.053
You didn't pay for your share
of the pork belly with Woo-young.

36:21.596 --> 36:24.265
-What?
-So why are you trying to pay for this?

36:26.225 --> 36:28.352
That's because he's the one
who invited us.

36:28.436 --> 36:31.981
I'm the one who suggested watching a movie
and eating dinner together.

36:35.526 --> 36:36.819
Goodbye.

36:39.697 --> 36:40.948
Bye.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.796
The forecast didn't say
it would rain today.

36:58.841 --> 37:02.678
<i>I have seven dollars left.</i>
<i>Will that be enough to pay for the cab?</i>

37:10.519 --> 37:11.646
Just a moment.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.577
Hello.

37:29.163 --> 37:32.333
-Can I have one more of this?
-That's the only one we have left.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.816
-You can take this.
-What about you?

37:56.899 --> 37:58.859
I can run to the bus stop.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.656
Let's go together. I'll walk you there.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.163
Let's go.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.708
No, it's okay.
It's too small for two people.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.084
You can take it.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.298
Then you take it.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.177
Hey.

38:34.895 --> 38:37.732
You're getting all wet. Get under here.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.151
Then you'll get wet.

38:40.985 --> 38:41.902
Come closer.

39:02.631 --> 39:05.593
The umbrella is so small, isn't it?

39:07.928 --> 39:08.804
Yes.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.188
Are you wearing perfume?

39:18.397 --> 39:21.233
No, I don't wear perfume
that often these days.

39:23.944 --> 39:25.154
Because I don't like it?

39:28.240 --> 39:29.825
Well, not exactly.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.417
I...

39:40.211 --> 39:41.754
went to the hospital that day.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.047
What?

39:49.512 --> 39:50.346
I met her.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.394
-I see.
-Aren't you going to ask how it went?

39:57.436 --> 39:59.188
I thought you wouldn't want me to ask.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.778
How did it go?

40:10.032 --> 40:10.908
It went quite well.

40:13.577 --> 40:14.495
Really?

40:16.455 --> 40:17.623
Wear that perfume.

40:24.630 --> 40:27.675
I'll do what I want.
I'm not going to do as you say.

40:32.555 --> 40:33.764
Forget it, then.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.104
I'm relieved.

40:42.898 --> 40:43.899
About what?

40:45.151 --> 40:46.777
That you don't hate your mom.

40:53.742 --> 40:54.827
Thanks.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.329
No problem.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.884
Seo Yoo-jin moved out of his apartment
and is living at his bar.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.637
Seeing that, I'm guessing
his business isn't doing that well.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.891
I'm worried that Kyung-seok might not
be able to get enough food.

41:16.974 --> 41:20.478
The elections are coming up,
but kids are only causing trouble.

41:21.228 --> 41:23.647
You must be going through
a lot these days.

41:24.398 --> 41:26.066
Do you know where Hye-sung lives?

41:28.861 --> 41:30.112
Let's go there.

41:30.571 --> 41:31.405
Okay.

41:39.622 --> 41:40.456
It's...

41:42.041 --> 41:43.042
not raining anymore.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.504
You're right.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.384
You should go now.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.053
It stopped raining.

41:54.136 --> 41:54.970
Here.

41:55.971 --> 41:57.056
You bought this.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.475
Okay.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.564
-See you.
-Bye.

42:10.653 --> 42:11.487
Wait.

42:19.995 --> 42:20.996
Take it.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.165
It might rain again.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.677
Okay.

42:35.803 --> 42:36.637
Thanks.

42:38.013 --> 42:39.431
No problem.

42:40.182 --> 42:42.935
Thank you for walking me all the way here.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.190
Then, bye.

42:53.487 --> 42:55.406
<i>I'll get heart disease at this rate.</i>

43:13.382 --> 43:14.967
<i>I definitely realized it.</i>

43:17.970 --> 43:19.638
<i>I can't...</i>

43:21.724 --> 43:24.351
<i>think of Kyung-seok as just a guy friend.</i>

43:44.747 --> 43:45.914
<i>Stay healthy.</i>

43:55.007 --> 43:55.966
Who is it?

43:56.050 --> 43:57.801
Hello, Ms. Na Hye-sung.

43:59.094 --> 44:00.012
Who is this?

44:00.095 --> 44:04.350
I'm sorry to visit you at this hour.
My name is Jung Young-mo.

44:06.894 --> 44:07.853
It's me.

44:27.122 --> 44:30.167
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get back at me?

44:31.627 --> 44:33.045
How did you find me here?

44:34.129 --> 44:35.964
Did you have someone look into me?

44:36.048 --> 44:40.344
Do you still have no respect for me?
That you would barge into my home?

44:46.684 --> 44:47.768
Send Kyung-seok home.

44:48.977 --> 44:51.230
-What?
-Are you pretending to be clueless?

44:52.147 --> 44:54.441
After he met with you yesterday,
he left home.

44:57.903 --> 45:00.197
You told him that I hit you...

45:00.948 --> 45:02.741
when you saw him after 10 years?

45:05.077 --> 45:06.412
I didn't tell him that.

45:07.663 --> 45:08.580
You didn't?

45:09.832 --> 45:13.293
Only two of us know
what happened between us.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.130
Then you told him.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.762
Where is Kyung-seok now?

45:25.180 --> 45:27.349
If you know where he is,
will you take him?

45:27.433 --> 45:29.435
That's up to Kyung-seok.

45:32.479 --> 45:34.398
Get out if that's all you came to say.

45:49.872 --> 45:51.457
It's been 10 years, right?

45:51.540 --> 45:53.500
-Mind your own business.
-Yes, sir.

46:12.853 --> 46:14.605
What's up with this weather?

46:15.647 --> 46:16.482
Let's go.

46:18.650 --> 46:20.027
Gosh.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.198
You're back.

46:25.741 --> 46:27.159
What are you doing?

46:29.203 --> 46:31.997
How did you sleep here?
I almost fell when I turned.

46:32.080 --> 46:33.415
I don't move when I sleep.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.043
You take the room tonight.

46:36.126 --> 46:39.004
That's fine.
Don't call 911 after you fall off.

46:42.674 --> 46:45.719
I might move back home.

46:46.929 --> 46:50.599
If I move back in after using up
the deposit, my dad really might kill me.

46:53.060 --> 46:56.104
-When will you go back?
-I don't know. I should ask my mom.

46:58.941 --> 47:00.818
You should move back home, too.

47:01.276 --> 47:02.986
-Stop being a rebel.
-I won't.

47:03.070 --> 47:04.488
How will you get by?

47:04.571 --> 47:07.074
I'll get a part-time job
and a place, too.

47:08.242 --> 47:09.576
Put up with me until then.

47:10.744 --> 47:13.413
Hey, you think
you're better than me, right?

47:13.831 --> 47:17.751
Making a living in this world isn't
that easy. Got that?

47:20.087 --> 47:22.422
Get the lights. I'm going to sleep.

47:27.010 --> 47:29.346
<i>-Is there a specific job you'd like?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

47:29.429 --> 47:34.226
No questions regarding your personal life.
No copy of your family registry.

47:34.309 --> 47:38.313
No jobs that require you to talk a lot.
You can't work every day or overtime,

47:38.897 --> 47:41.942
-but you want a job that pays well?
-Yes.

47:43.861 --> 47:47.865
I think it'd be better
if you look for a job yourself.

47:48.740 --> 47:49.575
Pardon?

47:49.658 --> 47:53.745
There must be a lot on the recruiting
website or the school website.

47:58.166 --> 47:59.751
-I'll go a little later.
-Okay.

47:59.835 --> 48:03.547
JOB PLACEMENT OFFICE

48:08.510 --> 48:10.345
Why is he coming out of this office?

48:11.597 --> 48:13.307
Why are you coming out of here?

48:14.516 --> 48:16.310
Why did he come out of this office?

48:18.145 --> 48:19.605
-Thank you.
-Sure.

48:24.943 --> 48:25.986
Ta-da.

48:27.613 --> 48:28.530
Isn't this cool?

48:29.531 --> 48:30.407
Here.

48:32.492 --> 48:34.036
-Jung-ho.
-Yes?

48:34.161 --> 48:37.998
You know the expression,
"Little strokes fell great oaks"?

48:38.498 --> 48:42.628
-That applies to trees, not to people.
-Then you should give up on Kyung-seok.

48:43.211 --> 48:45.380
-Why?
-He's a person, too.

48:47.966 --> 48:49.176
You little runt!

48:54.431 --> 48:56.934
I saw him coming out
from the job placement office.

48:57.559 --> 48:58.769
Why would he go there?

48:59.353 --> 49:01.021
A rich guy wouldn't need a job.

49:01.271 --> 49:05.025
He's just showing that even a son
of a congressman has a part-time job.

49:05.108 --> 49:06.944
He's not a congressman anymore.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.445
He will be a mayor soon.

49:17.996 --> 49:21.708
That jerk, Kyung-seok.
That explains his behavior.

49:29.216 --> 49:32.135
What's up with this jerk?
Why does he order me around?

49:48.068 --> 49:50.153
Let's keep some distance.

49:51.279 --> 49:53.865
It won't be awkward after some time.

49:59.579 --> 50:02.541
STUDIO IN PRIME LOCATION
COOL STUDIO FOR 600,000 WON A MONTH

50:02.624 --> 50:06.461
ROOFTOP HOUSE NEAR SCHOOL, THE RENT IS
100,000 WON. WE'LL DISCUSS DETAILS.

50:07.045 --> 50:08.130
What are you doing?

50:15.387 --> 50:16.805
Was the movie fun yesterday?

50:16.888 --> 50:17.723
Yes.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.106
I'm busy right now.

50:34.656 --> 50:38.410
Drink this, buddy. Goodness.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.874
Look at that.
I've never seen him walk that fast.

50:43.957 --> 50:46.918
He always seemed to be annoyed
by everything around him.

50:47.085 --> 50:49.171
What? He's even running now?

50:49.254 --> 50:50.964
Hey, Kyung-seok is running.

50:51.465 --> 50:52.966
What's going on? What is this?

50:54.342 --> 50:57.262
Just like any other day,
I'm talking to myself.

50:58.805 --> 50:59.931
What are you doing?

51:01.767 --> 51:04.019
Didn't Kyung-seok wear that
the other day?

51:05.479 --> 51:07.856
That's not 55,000 won.
It's 550,000 won?

51:08.398 --> 51:09.524
Come on.

51:11.276 --> 51:12.360
Buddy.

51:13.653 --> 51:17.574
No matter how great it is,
don't copy someone else.

51:17.657 --> 51:18.909
I wasn't going to buy it.

51:19.910 --> 51:20.952
I won't buy it.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.747
"I won't buy it."
Actually, you can't afford it.

51:24.790 --> 51:30.670
Hey, you drink it. What do you know
about my family's finances?

51:31.296 --> 51:33.673
Oh, my. How are the finances?

51:33.757 --> 51:36.176
How are they? Tell me.

51:38.637 --> 51:40.263
We're better off than yours.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.688
What do you know about it?

51:48.772 --> 51:51.191
If you keep skipping classes,
you can't graduate.

51:51.274 --> 51:54.945
-Do you want to stay one more semester?
-It's just that it's embarrassing.

51:55.028 --> 51:58.365
Could you come to classes
after being humiliated by a freshman?

51:59.366 --> 52:02.828
Then apologize to him like a senior
and clear the air. Don't avoid him.

52:03.537 --> 52:06.581
I should've done that then.
It's too late now.

52:11.336 --> 52:14.464
-Is it true? Is Do Kyung-seok...
-What?

52:15.215 --> 52:16.508
Nothing.

52:19.511 --> 52:21.346
What is this?

52:21.638 --> 52:22.806
Unbelievable.

52:37.571 --> 52:40.532
OFFICE OF CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT
TA: YEON WOO-YOUNG

52:45.745 --> 52:46.788
Long time no see.

52:47.414 --> 52:48.248
Yes.

52:51.459 --> 52:53.879
-You've been well, right?
-Yes.

52:54.838 --> 52:58.383
I've been wanting to see you.

52:58.925 --> 53:01.261
-Can we talk for a second?
-I'm busy right now.

53:02.929 --> 53:04.055
You're busy.

53:04.598 --> 53:06.933
Then I'll see you later.

53:07.017 --> 53:07.934
Okay.

53:16.234 --> 53:18.737
Had I known, I wouldn't have done that.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.702
You want to move into my place?

53:26.453 --> 53:28.205
-Why?
-I moved out.

53:28.288 --> 53:30.415
You moved out, but you don't have a place?

53:30.832 --> 53:32.959
-No.
-If you moved out, why don't...

53:34.294 --> 53:35.212
You ran away from home?

53:38.340 --> 53:40.091
I don't want a short-term roommate.

53:40.175 --> 53:42.344
It's not short-term. It's long-term.

53:44.971 --> 53:45.889
Take a seat.

53:55.190 --> 53:56.358
Did you read the terms?

53:57.817 --> 54:01.488
But as for the first month, could you
accept the TV I gave you as my rent?

54:02.197 --> 54:04.574
-Come again?
-A microwave or a coffee maker?

54:06.076 --> 54:08.036
I saw that you don't have either.

54:09.412 --> 54:10.288
No money?

54:11.790 --> 54:12.791
I'll pay soon.

54:12.874 --> 54:15.001
-You did run away.
-I moved out on my own.

54:20.799 --> 54:23.385
Have you already found one?
I mean, a roommate.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.095
No, not yet.

54:28.848 --> 54:30.058
Then let's do this.

54:34.187 --> 54:35.146
AGREEMENT

54:35.939 --> 54:39.484
Just pay 70,000 won a month, but you must
take care of all the housework. Okay?

54:42.362 --> 54:43.446
AGREEMENT

54:43.530 --> 54:45.156
YEON WOO-YOUNG
DO KYUNG-SEOK

54:49.202 --> 54:52.122
Pay 30,000 won more
if you don't want to do housework.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.335
I'll do it.
I'll take care of all the housework.

55:03.174 --> 55:05.135
Oh, it must be that way.

55:05.218 --> 55:07.846
Put them in the fridge
and come back out quickly.

55:07.929 --> 55:11.599
I should cut up the watermelon.
They won't eat it if I leave it like that.

55:11.808 --> 55:14.227
I can't park on the street for that long.

55:14.894 --> 55:17.480
All right. I'll be quick.

55:21.526 --> 55:23.153
My gosh, it's that guy.

55:23.278 --> 55:25.905
-Pull over for a moment.
-Why? Who is he?

55:31.119 --> 55:33.163
It's so nice to run into you like this.

55:33.246 --> 55:34.372
Do you remember me?

55:34.914 --> 55:36.333
Oh, yes. Hello.

55:37.208 --> 55:40.086
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.965
Thank you so much for everything
the other day.

55:44.090 --> 55:45.884
Where are you headed? Get in.

55:45.967 --> 55:47.635
It's okay. I live right there.

55:50.096 --> 55:50.930
Mom.

55:51.473 --> 55:53.767
-Are you getting home now?
-What's up?

55:55.310 --> 55:57.145
-Hello.
-Hi.

55:59.773 --> 56:02.275
-He's a senior in my department.
-Really?

56:03.943 --> 56:06.654
You and my daughter are
in the same department.

56:06.738 --> 56:08.114
Yes, hello.

56:08.782 --> 56:11.159
-It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

56:19.376 --> 56:21.336
Does he live alone, too?

56:21.795 --> 56:22.712
Yes.

56:24.964 --> 56:26.508
How old is he?

56:26.591 --> 56:28.385
I guess he's around 26?

56:29.177 --> 56:30.428
So he's six years older.

56:32.472 --> 56:35.225
Take some of these side dishes to him.
Some watermelon, too.

56:35.892 --> 56:36.768
To Woo-young?

56:36.851 --> 56:39.479
He probably never buys one
because he lives alone.

56:39.562 --> 56:41.606
-I'll cut it up. Take some to him.
-Okay.

56:41.689 --> 56:43.274
Hurry up already!

56:44.484 --> 56:47.153
Can't he just drive around the block
if he can't park?

56:48.321 --> 56:49.781
Make sure you take it to him.

57:22.647 --> 57:23.898
Yes, Ms. Na.

57:23.982 --> 57:26.818
-How have you been?
<i>-Good.</i>

57:27.527 --> 57:29.612
How are you feeling? Are you better now?

57:30.864 --> 57:33.575
I'm fine now.
Thank you so much for your help that day.

57:34.159 --> 57:35.285
No problem.

57:37.912 --> 57:40.915
How's Kyung-seok?
Is everything well with him?

57:41.541 --> 57:44.127
Yes, he's doing great.

57:48.089 --> 57:50.717
I heard that you two finally met.

57:52.927 --> 57:54.095
Thank you for that too.

57:57.015 --> 58:00.185
Well, could you give me his number?

58:00.393 --> 58:01.686
I forgot to ask him.

58:02.187 --> 58:04.063
Sure, I'll send it to you right away.

58:04.564 --> 58:08.526
Okay. Take care. Bye.

58:12.071 --> 58:15.533
DO KYUNG-SEOK

58:15.617 --> 58:18.661
KANG MI-RAE

58:39.766 --> 58:40.808
Who is it?

58:41.726 --> 58:42.602
Hey, Mi-rae.

58:45.104 --> 58:48.274
My mom wanted me to give you this.

58:50.026 --> 58:51.861
-Your mom?
-Yes.

58:54.739 --> 58:56.574
Take the containers. Come in.

59:01.746 --> 59:04.541
Make sure you tell your mom
that I thanked her.

59:04.624 --> 59:05.583
Okay.

59:07.293 --> 59:10.421
-You should put everything in the fridge.
-Oh, right.

59:11.756 --> 59:12.715
Let's see.

59:20.390 --> 59:22.767
Hey, what are you doing here?

59:23.560 --> 59:24.769
I live here now.

59:32.652 --> 59:33.611
What?

59:53.464 --> 59:58.177
In a month, rent and half of utilities are
due. Also, we'll buy our own food, okay?

59:59.095 --> 1:00:01.347
Look at that. Woo-young is so sweet.

1:00:01.431 --> 1:00:03.891
Don't you think that guy likes Mi-rae?

1:00:03.975 --> 1:00:04.809
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:00:04.892 --> 1:00:06.019
Hi.

1:00:06.102 --> 1:00:09.647
-You live with your grandparents?
-You've become very curious about me.

1:00:09.731 --> 1:00:13.109
<i>Do Kyung-seok and Hyun Sua.</i>
<i>They look so lovely together.</i>

1:00:13.192 --> 1:00:16.487
