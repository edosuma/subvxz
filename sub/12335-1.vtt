01:52.246 --> 01:53.011
- Baby!

01:53.013 --> 01:53.846
- Mommy!

01:53.848 --> 01:54.813
- Are you okay?

01:54.815 --> 01:56.048
- Yes, but I'm scared.

01:56.050 --> 01:58.750
- I'm gonna get us out of here.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.185
I think I found a way back up.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.320
- Up?

02:01.322 --> 02:02.921
Where are we, Mommy?

02:02.923 --> 02:05.057
- You know that show you like,

02:05.059 --> 02:07.192
where um, people have to compete

02:07.194 --> 02:09.026
missions to win prizes.

02:09.029 --> 02:09.961
It's just like that.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.130
We're, we're in a show,

02:11.132 --> 02:12.297
and we just need
to win this round.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.198
- Mom!

02:13.200 --> 02:13.999
- Okay, everything's fine.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.001
- Mom!

02:15.936 --> 02:18.103
I know it's not a game.

02:19.974 --> 02:20.772
- Oh my God.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.141
I'm so sorry.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.343
My sweet baby.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.513
I wish you thought this
was all a big game.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.818
Oh no.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.020
- Mommy, is, is, is the
game starting again?

02:35.022 --> 02:35.921
- Listen to me.

02:35.923 --> 02:36.688
This is not a game.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.589
This is real.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.824
We have to get out of here.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.459
- I know, I thought you
wanted me to pretend.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.027
- Stay right here, okay?

02:42.029 --> 02:42.861
- No!

02:42.863 --> 02:43.862
Don't leave me!

02:43.864 --> 02:45.030
- I'll be right back.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.298
I have to, I have
to distract him.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.300
Please be brave, baby.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.501
Okay?

02:49.503 --> 02:50.669
Just pretend this
is all a big game.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.138
- But I thought you said not to!

02:53.908 --> 02:55.474
Mommy!

03:45.693 --> 03:46.825
- Hey.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.694
I got one for you.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.796
So, there's a man, right,

03:50.798 --> 03:53.098
and he gets a call
from the hospital,

03:53.100 --> 03:55.834
and uh, no wait, hold on.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.102
Let me start over.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.771
So there's this man, and
he's at the hospital,

03:59.773 --> 04:02.241
and he has a meeting
with this doctor,

04:02.243 --> 04:04.610
and he says um...

04:06.914 --> 04:12.985
Hey, are you listening?

04:17.423 --> 04:18.790
Hey look.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.459
I was just saying that

04:20.461 --> 04:22.894
I don't know if we
have to retire so soon.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.864
- That's been the
plan this whole time.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.435
One last job,

04:30.437 --> 04:31.670
travel for a year,

04:31.672 --> 04:33.639
settle down and...

04:33.641 --> 04:35.507
Find normal lives.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.908
- We're so good at this.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.176
Do we have to
stick to that plan?

04:38.178 --> 04:39.611
- Always stick to the plan.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.746
- Are you sure this time though?

04:40.748 --> 04:41.613
Like really sure.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.981
- I'm always sure.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.383
I could not be more
sure about this.

04:44.385 --> 04:47.886
I'm a hundred million
billion percent sure.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.008
- Yeah, that sounds
like you're pretty sure.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.661
- We're 30 years old,

04:55.663 --> 04:58.630
sitting in a fake painter's van,

04:58.632 --> 05:00.732
about to rob a house.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.600
- So cool.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.136
- It's not cool.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.203
It used to be cool.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.183
- Okay.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.255
This is our last job.

05:23.257 --> 05:24.656
As planned.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.392
- Are you sure?

05:27.394 --> 05:29.161
- I am...

05:29.163 --> 05:31.296
100,000 billion percent sure.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.931
- Shut up.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.301
- Yeah, sure.

05:38.706 --> 05:42.741
- Thank you.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.450
- There she is.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.452
- Faster than schedule.

05:53.454 --> 05:59.991
- Ready?
- Yeah.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.360
Finish it.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.194
- Finish what?

06:02.196 --> 06:04.363
- The joke.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.297
- Yes.

06:05.299 --> 06:05.997
The joke.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.432
So, um...

06:07.434 --> 06:08.667
So there's this man.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.135
He rushes to the hospital,

06:10.137 --> 06:11.703
gets there, the
doctor comes out,

06:11.705 --> 06:12.938
and he says, I'm so sorry.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.906
- Wait, why is he
rushing to the hospital?

06:14.908 --> 06:19.077
- Oh, his wife was
in an accident.

06:19.079 --> 06:19.978
Wait.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.713
I thought I just said that.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.083
So where was I?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.251
Um...

06:26.253 --> 06:27.386
Oh right, she was
in an accident,

06:27.388 --> 06:28.620
and the doctor says, uh...

06:28.622 --> 06:29.888
- What kind of accident?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.924
- Again, so, worst
shape possible.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.659
She basically lost
all of her limbs,

06:34.661 --> 06:36.128
so, the doctor says, you know,

06:36.130 --> 06:38.597
and she may not be able to
recognize you ever, ever again,

06:38.599 --> 06:40.332
and the husband
says, oh my gosh,

06:40.334 --> 06:41.967
this is terrible news.

06:41.969 --> 06:45.504
And the doctor says,
by the way, she's dead.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.309
She's, she's dead.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.714
- So a man hears that his
wife's in a horrible accident,

06:55.716 --> 06:57.149
he rushes to the hospital.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.251
When he gets there, the
doctor says, I'm so sorry,

06:59.253 --> 07:00.685
but the accident
has left your wife

07:00.687 --> 07:02.454
blind, deaf, and mute,

07:02.456 --> 07:04.189
and she'll never be able
to recognize you again.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.458
The guy's like, oh my God
this is terrible news,

07:06.460 --> 07:07.726
and that's when the doctor says,

07:07.728 --> 07:08.727
I'm just kidding.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.828
She's dead.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.332
- It's funnier.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.971
- 30 seconds.

07:19.973 --> 07:24.209
- Man, it's really our last one.

07:32.085 --> 07:32.984
Ssh.

07:32.986 --> 07:33.819
Wrap up, wrap up, wrap up.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.120
- Shit.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.122
- We gotta go,
we can't go this way.

07:37.124 --> 07:37.889
- Okay.

07:37.891 --> 07:38.557
- You ready?

07:38.559 --> 07:39.624
- Yeah.
- Ready.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.626
- Okay.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.360
Where're you going?

07:42.362 --> 07:43.028
- I thought you were with me.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.429
- Get over here.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.197
- Shit.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.431
- Shit.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.337
- Take your clothes off.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.141
- Ah-ha, do it in
your place for once.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.209
- Who's he home with?

07:57.211 --> 07:58.243
- I don't know.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.345
She's supposed to be a Pilates.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.780
- Hey, can we bring
your dog up on this one?

08:01.782 --> 08:06.551
- Wait, what?
No.

08:06.553 --> 08:07.953
- I'm an adult.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.488
- Wait.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.556
- What was that?

08:11.558 --> 08:12.390
- Oh, God.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.124
My husband.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.895
Shit.
Hide.

08:16.897 --> 08:17.896
- I can go
out this window.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.564
- No, hide.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.732
Get in the closet.

08:21.969 --> 08:22.969
Go.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.618
Hi.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.222
- Hi, honey.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.290
- Honey?

08:59.306 --> 09:00.338
Honey, honey.
Wait!

09:00.340 --> 09:01.406
No!

09:01.942 --> 09:03.241
Wait I can...

09:03.243 --> 09:04.009
- Oh shit.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.093
Shit, shit, shit.

09:05.094 --> 09:06.176
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, uh...

09:06.179 --> 09:07.846
- Get the fuck out!

09:08.715 --> 09:09.714
- Oh my God.

09:09.716 --> 09:10.899
Oh my God.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.083
Honey, they're robbers.
Shoot them.

09:12.085 --> 09:12.751
Shoot them, they're robbing us.

09:12.753 --> 09:13.685
They're robbers.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.053
- No, we're not robbers, okay?

09:15.055 --> 09:15.754
We're not robbers.

09:15.756 --> 09:16.788
We're...

09:16.790 --> 09:17.790
We're swingers.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.326
- We're not into foursomes.

09:26.867 --> 09:27.799
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.234
She laughs when she's scared.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.001
- Get the fuck out.

09:30.003 --> 09:30.702
- Listen, we're not,

09:30.704 --> 09:31.836
we're robbers.

09:31.838 --> 09:32.737
We are robbers, okay,

09:32.739 --> 09:34.306
and she's not fucking us.

09:34.308 --> 09:35.507
- No.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.441
- All right, she's
fucking this guy!

09:36.443 --> 09:38.510
- Oh God, oh shit, okay.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.250
- Hello, my name is Juan.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.452
I was...

09:48.422 --> 09:49.454
Cleaning the pool.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.255
- Honey, I can explain, okay?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.089
This is, this is Juan.

09:51.091 --> 09:51.890
He's...

09:51.892 --> 09:52.657
- No!

09:52.659 --> 09:54.826
- Honey!

10:03.870 --> 10:05.136
Where you going?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.137
- I have to help them.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.305
- No, no no.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.106
The cops are gonna
be here any second,

10:08.108 --> 10:09.207
and you're two strikes.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.742
- Okay, you're
right, you're right.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.344
They're gonna be here, I'm
gonna buy them some time.

10:12.346 --> 10:13.511
- Well, what about us?

10:13.513 --> 10:14.579
- Take the van, go
down the street,

10:14.581 --> 10:15.480
wait for me there.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.414
- No, that's not the plan.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.215
- Fuck the plan, Blair, okay.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.383
He's gonna kill them.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.228
- How could you?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.931
I loved you!

10:32.933 --> 10:34.132
- Hey.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.433
Hey you.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.203
This is the police.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.170
All right, freeze.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.672
Fuck face.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.310
We know you're up
there, all right?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.177
We want you to come out,

10:46.179 --> 10:47.012
and reach for the sky,

10:47.014 --> 10:48.179
or...

10:48.181 --> 10:49.381
I will shoot you in the face.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.187
Oh shit.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.155
Shit.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.223
Shit, shit.

11:31.625 --> 11:32.724
- Hey!

11:32.726 --> 11:33.525
Police!

11:33.527 --> 11:34.793
Freeze, fuck face!

11:36.530 --> 11:37.530
Hands in the air.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.665
- Stop.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.341
Reach for the sky or I
will shoot you in the face.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.772
What do you know about me, boy?

11:47.774 --> 11:49.040
- Now it's done.

11:51.978 --> 11:52.744
I'm callin' this in.

11:52.746 --> 11:53.745
Thank you.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.246
Hey, guess what?

11:55.248 --> 11:56.548
In case you didn't know,

11:56.550 --> 11:59.617
you have the right to
remain silent, bitch.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.904
- Hello.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.582
No, no, no, no!

12:30.584 --> 12:31.584
Shit.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.754
- Hey.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.824
You, you're out.

12:53.673 --> 12:54.472
- Where you taking me?

12:54.474 --> 12:55.940
- Shut the fuck up.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.145
We're almost there.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.467
- Are you okay?

13:22.469 --> 13:29.474
- Yeah.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.685
Blair, I'm so sorry.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.120
Okay, I'm, I'm a fucking idiot.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.255
I just...

13:48.562 --> 13:49.494
Please don't tell me

13:49.496 --> 13:50.929
those were Timmy Song's guys.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.998
- He's the only one powerful
enough to get you out.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.316
- Okay.

13:55.317 --> 13:56.633
Blair, we have to go. We have
to get out of town right now.

13:56.636 --> 13:57.569
- No, Ollie.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.204
I gave him everything we had.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.560
And I had to borrow
on top of that.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.576
Look, you don't have to
worry about that right now.

14:04.578 --> 14:05.844
- No, I have to
worry about it, okay?

14:05.846 --> 14:08.146
He calculates his late
fees in body parts.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.108
All right, when's
our first payment?

14:10.617 --> 14:11.950
- Next week.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.184
- Fuck.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.826
- I set the thing up
already for tomorrow.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.387
- What do you mean, tomorrow?

14:16.389 --> 14:17.188
- Connor offered.

14:17.190 --> 14:17.956
It's a vacation home-

14:17.958 --> 14:19.290
- Connor?

14:19.292 --> 14:20.658
The reason why I
have two strikes

14:20.660 --> 14:22.527
is because your
brother is incompetent.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.395
He's reckless.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.396
All right, he can't read.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.197
- Hey.

14:26.199 --> 14:26.998
I looked over the plans

14:27.000 --> 14:28.233
and they look good.

14:28.235 --> 14:28.900
Okay?

14:28.902 --> 14:30.301
Easy.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.172
- All right.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.542
Okay, after this,
it's our last one.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.643
This time for real.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.744
Our last one.

14:39.746 --> 14:40.912
I should have listened to you.

14:40.914 --> 14:41.579
We should have stopped
a long time ago,

14:41.581 --> 14:42.447
but I kept...

14:42.449 --> 14:43.514
- Ollie!

14:43.516 --> 14:45.016
- What?

14:45.018 --> 14:46.851
- He won't work with you again.

14:49.522 --> 14:54.759
We're doing this
job without you.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.765
Shit.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.669
- All right,
let's go over this again.

15:04.671 --> 15:05.570
- All right.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.971
7:00 AM we leave from here.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.673
8:30 we arrive at the house.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.708
I back the van all the
way up to the front.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.777
8:35, you pick the lock,

15:12.779 --> 15:14.012
and open the side door.

15:14.014 --> 15:14.946
- Okay.

15:14.948 --> 15:15.713
- Blair keeps the van runnin',

15:15.715 --> 15:17.315
and you and me load up.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.650
- Good job.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.251
You got any problems
picking up the van?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.386
- No.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.153
- All right, so
it's all filled up,

15:22.155 --> 15:23.221
we're ready to go?

15:23.223 --> 15:24.555
- Filled up?

15:24.557 --> 15:26.024
- Riley.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.592
Come on, man.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.693
Details.

15:28.695 --> 15:29.494
- No...

15:29.496 --> 15:30.528
I'm sorry.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.963
You mad?

15:32.799 --> 15:34.265
- I'm not mad, I just,

15:34.267 --> 15:35.633
I'm disappointed.

15:35.635 --> 15:36.301
All right?

15:36.303 --> 15:37.402
You're my crew.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.937
So bring your A game.

15:38.939 --> 15:39.704
- I'll go do it right now.

15:39.706 --> 15:40.972
- No, forget it.

15:40.974 --> 15:41.739
I mean, we have enough
time tomorrow morning

15:41.741 --> 15:42.674
to fill up the tank.

15:42.676 --> 15:43.808
It's the principle of the thing.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.510
Let's just go over this again.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.079
- Hey.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.047
- Hey.

15:49.049 --> 15:49.781
- Hey.

15:49.783 --> 15:50.915
- Ollie.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.183
What's he doin' here?

15:52.185 --> 15:53.184
- Just hear 'im out.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.319
- No.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.219
- Connor, I just
came by to say that

15:55.221 --> 15:57.121
I appreciate all the help.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.827
- Jellyfish.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.462
Yeah, I'm really just
helping my sister out.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.797
So...

16:05.799 --> 16:07.759
- I understand
that, and thank you.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.302
- Yeah.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.871
- So, uh, what's the plan?

16:13.873 --> 16:14.839
- Well, 7 AM we leave from here-

16:14.841 --> 16:16.007
- Riley, no.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.208
Stop.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.710
He's not part of the crew.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.044
Didn't my sister tell you?

16:20.046 --> 16:21.245
You're not in.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.680
- I understand that, Connor.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.817
I was just, wanted to see
what you guys had planned.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.018
- No.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.853
This is exactly my
problem with you.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.088
- You're problem with me?

16:30.090 --> 16:30.955
- You want me to take
care of this, boss?

16:30.957 --> 16:32.223
- Step back.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.391
- You just tell me to step back?

16:33.393 --> 16:34.392
Don't tell me to step back.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.626
I'll step back if I want.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.161
I'll step off, I'll
step up to the streets

16:37.163 --> 16:39.430
if I want to.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.631
- You know what my problem
is with you, Ollie?

16:40.633 --> 16:42.200
Your lack of respect.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.135
That's my problem with you.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.337
- I, I respect you.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.138
- No you don't.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.506
You don't trust me.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.307
Never have.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.241
- Maybe that's because

16:50.243 --> 16:52.043
you've landed me in jail twice.

16:52.045 --> 16:52.877
- That's not helping.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.213
- You're not helpin'.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.080
- Where'd you get this guy?

16:56.082 --> 16:57.015
- I told you to play dead.

16:57.017 --> 16:57.915
I escaped because I played dead.

16:57.917 --> 16:58.583
- Played dead?

16:58.585 --> 16:59.384
- Yeah.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.084
That wasn't my fault.

17:00.086 --> 17:00.918
- Get me?

17:00.920 --> 17:01.719
- Yeah.

17:01.721 --> 17:02.854
- Where'd you come from?

17:02.856 --> 17:03.521
I've known this
guy for six months.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.422
- What is that?

17:04.424 --> 17:05.390
- It's a good plan.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.891
- I'm his crew, we go way back.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.092
What about you?

17:08.094 --> 17:09.493
- I'm his sister.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.628
- Okay, everyone stop.

17:11.631 --> 17:15.633
This is my lead, my
research, my job.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.035
You're out.

17:30.784 --> 17:31.549
- No, wait.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.184
Connor listen.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.490
Look, I'm begging you, okay.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.459
I'm begging you to let me go.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.394
Look, the only
reason Blair is here,

17:43.396 --> 17:44.695
the reason why
we're in this mess,

17:44.697 --> 17:46.097
it's because of me.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.598
I didn't put her first,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.834
and now we've lost everything.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.969
And I can't risk losing her too.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.072
I don't care about the plans,
I don't care about the score.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.239
I'm begging you.

17:55.241 --> 18:02.046
Please let me come.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.052
- If I let you come...

18:09.489 --> 18:10.755
I have ground rules.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.292
First, the cut remains the same.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.795
You're not gettin' any extra
money for coming along.

18:17.797 --> 18:18.596
- Totally fair.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.530
- Yeah.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.099
- Second, you're lookout only.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.567
You're not goin' inside.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.434
- Can't he be lookout?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.470
- It's fine.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.392
Actually, yeah,
can he be lookout?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.974
- I'm not done.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.510
Last, you need to respect
my leadership skills.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.246
I'm the leader, okay,

18:35.248 --> 18:37.281
and you need to
treat me accordingly.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.516
- You realize that real leaders

18:38.518 --> 18:40.518
don't tell others they
have leadership skills,

18:40.520 --> 18:42.053
but you got-

18:42.055 --> 18:43.654
- You sure about that, man?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.089
I mean, this is my heist, right?

18:45.091 --> 18:46.457
- This is just a robbery.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.859
Look, this is your heist,

18:47.861 --> 18:50.862
you're the leader and I
respect your leadership skills.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.699
- Too late, homie.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.034
- All right.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.669
- All right.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.172
- You can come
along on the heist.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.306
- It's not a heist.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.407
- Thank you.

19:03.409 --> 19:04.375
- Hey, all right.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.843
Yeah, okay.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.980
- Thank you.

19:10.016 --> 19:10.882
- Yeah.

19:10.884 --> 19:11.884
- It means a lot.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.426
- You guys hear me okay?

19:55.428 --> 19:56.093
- Yep.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.261
- Clear up here.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.863
- All right.

19:58.865 --> 20:04.168
Be back in a minute.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.373
All right, guys,
let me show you how

20:09.375 --> 20:10.641
the big boys do it.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.244
- I'm buyin' boobs.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.326
What are you gonna get?

20:15.215 --> 20:16.147
- What?

20:16.149 --> 20:17.481
- With the money from this.

20:17.483 --> 20:18.916
My girlfriend
needs bigger boobs.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.585
It's the first thing I'm buyin'.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.119
What about you?

20:22.121 --> 20:23.421
- I like my boobs.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.522
So your girlfriend
just straight up said,

20:24.524 --> 20:25.856
honey, buy me boobs?

20:25.858 --> 20:27.124
- Naw, she didn't know about it,

20:27.126 --> 20:28.659
but she's mad at me, so,

20:28.661 --> 20:30.728
I'm gonna surprise her.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.063
Hey, turn around for a sec.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.199
Where'd you get your boobs?

20:35.201 --> 20:37.301
Yours are real, huh?

20:37.303 --> 20:38.703
Nice.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.037
- Riley, if you don't
stop looking at my boobs,

20:40.039 --> 20:41.272
I will uppercut your dick,

20:41.274 --> 20:42.373
I swear to God.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.142
- That would hurt.

20:45.144 --> 20:46.677
- Is everything okay?

20:46.679 --> 20:48.145
- Yeah, Riley's just
telling me about

20:48.147 --> 20:49.513
how he's buying new boobs

20:49.515 --> 20:50.848
for his girlfriend.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.717
What, is she mad at you
or something, Riley?

20:52.719 --> 20:53.951
- Yeah.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.220
She mad at me 'cause
I wanna go to Mars.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.955
- This just keeps gettin'
better and better.

20:57.957 --> 20:58.956
- Wait.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.124
You were serious?

21:00.126 --> 21:01.792
- Yeah, and I signed
up on a program,

21:01.794 --> 21:04.028
where you can win a
one-way trip to Mars.

21:04.030 --> 21:04.962
I think it's like

21:04.964 --> 21:07.298
a nine-month ride in space.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.799
And she don't understand
why I wanna do it,

21:08.801 --> 21:10.568
but I'm like, come on, man.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.304
It's Mars.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.772
Like, I could be

21:14.774 --> 21:16.774
the Magellan of space.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.576
I mean, I might not
actually be Magellan.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.379
I'm sure I'd be like his
first mate or somethin'.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.348
I don't know.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.183
I don't know.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.818
They're probably
not gonna pick me.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.620
- Don't give up hope, Riley.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.821
You never know.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.859
Hey, what's Connor doin'?

21:34.861 --> 21:36.227
- Connor.

21:36.229 --> 21:38.095
What's goin' on?

21:38.931 --> 21:40.164
- Everything's
fine, I'm just gonna

21:40.166 --> 21:41.465
go around to the back.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.134
- Hey, player, I
have one for you.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.069
So, a cop shows up
to a crime scene,

21:45.071 --> 21:47.805
and a citizen shows up and says,

21:47.807 --> 21:49.573
officer, officer, quick,

21:49.575 --> 21:51.976
there is a hundred
minorities and a plumber

21:51.978 --> 21:54.578
that really need
your help, and um...

21:56.149 --> 21:59.483
And the cop says, oh no,
we should help the plumber,

21:59.485 --> 22:02.620
and the citizen says, see,

22:02.622 --> 22:05.923
cops never care
about the minorities.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.693
Wait, is that right?

22:08.695 --> 22:10.027
- Okay.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.562
A citizen runs up to a cop

22:11.564 --> 22:13.397
and says a hundred minorities
and a plumber need your help,

22:13.399 --> 22:15.900
the cop says, why the plumber?

22:15.902 --> 22:17.868
Then the citizen says,
see, the cops never ask

22:17.870 --> 22:19.437
about the minorities.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.906
- Damn it.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.108
- He just forgot all the
important parts, right.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.045
- Fucking cops hate
minorities, man.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.247
Dude, I got pulled over
for tinted windows once.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.717
Hate the Po Po.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.419
- I'm in hell.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.956
What are you doing?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.057
- Just being safe.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.359
- There's no one in the house.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.660
- You sure about that?

22:42.662 --> 22:43.928
I mean, you never know.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.996
- No, our whole job
depends on being sure.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.732
You should always know.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.835
How long did you monitor
the owner's pattern?

22:50.837 --> 22:52.303
I know the plans say he won't
be back for a few weeks,

22:52.305 --> 22:54.605
but how long did you
monitor his routine?

22:54.607 --> 22:55.706
- Like, two-

22:55.708 --> 22:56.841
- Two months?

22:56.843 --> 22:58.109
- Two weeks.

22:58.111 --> 22:59.210
Two months?

22:59.212 --> 23:00.911
- Connor.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.413
Connor, come in.

23:02.415 --> 23:03.481
- I don't see him.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.415
How long has it been?

23:04.417 --> 23:05.883
- Just a few minutes.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.818
- Did he forget
how to pick a lock?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.987
That's not a
rhetorical question.

23:09.989 --> 23:10.888
- Yeah, no, I agree.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.723
That's a fair question.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.725
Hang on.

23:16.362 --> 23:18.162
You stay in the van.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.930
You don't need to bring that.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.632
- You're not the boss.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.334
- Hey, Blair, maybe I
should come down there.

23:23.336 --> 23:25.669
- No, we
got this, all right.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.938
- It just,
something's not right.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.980
- Stay put,
stick with the plan.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.211
- Blair, can you hear me?

23:34.213 --> 23:36.013
Blair?

23:37.350 --> 23:38.315
Blair, Blair.

23:38.317 --> 23:39.216
Hello?

23:39.218 --> 23:40.418
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.686
Blair, Blair, Blair,
Blair, Blair, Blair.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.325
Shit.

23:49.295 --> 23:50.895
Just stick to the plan.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.864
Just stick to the plan.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.439
Yeah, we'll stick to the plan.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.239
We're good.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.474
We'll just ah...

24:04.510 --> 24:06.610
Stick to the plan,
and it will be,

24:06.612 --> 24:08.245
you know what, fuck the plan.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.495
Blair!

25:35.368 --> 25:38.335
Connor.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.010
Blair, Blair.

25:49.682 --> 25:50.814
Ow, ow ow ow.

25:50.816 --> 25:51.882
Ow, ow.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.268
Shit.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.074
Blair.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.642
Blair.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.281
Fuck.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.051
Come on, Blair.

26:27.053 --> 26:29.286
Where the fuck are you?

26:33.826 --> 26:34.892
Blair?

26:48.541 --> 26:49.273
- Sorry.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.141
- Shit, Blair.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.176
Fuck.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.510
- How did you get in here?

26:53.512 --> 26:54.745
- From the skylight.

26:54.747 --> 26:55.746
- Fuck.

26:55.748 --> 26:56.680
- Listen, I heard you scream.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.315
Are you okay?

26:58.317 --> 26:59.650
- I wasn't screaming.

27:01.754 --> 27:02.753
- I've been calling you guys.

27:02.755 --> 27:03.520
What are you been doing?

27:03.522 --> 27:04.288
Everything's dead.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.522
- I know.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.323
- Move, move,
get out of the way.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.491
Come on, hurry, move.

27:09.695 --> 27:10.894
You ready?

27:10.896 --> 27:11.729
- Yeah.

27:17.570 --> 27:19.610
- I told you guys it
wasn't gonna work.

27:20.506 --> 27:21.672
- What the fuck, man?

27:21.674 --> 27:22.673
You're supposed
to be on lookout?

27:22.675 --> 27:23.974
- What's goin' on?

27:23.976 --> 27:26.176
- We're trying to
find a way out.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.578
But everything's locked
from the outside,

27:27.580 --> 27:29.079
and these locks,

27:29.081 --> 27:31.315
I just never seen
anything like them.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.883
The walls are concrete,
and I was telling the guys

27:32.885 --> 27:34.385
I think the windows
are palladium-

27:34.387 --> 27:35.886
- Palladium plated.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.155
Actually, that means you
can't break the windows.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.223
We're just double checking.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.424
- I know what it means, Connor.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.759
- Don't fucking
start with me, man.

27:41.761 --> 27:42.660
All right?

27:42.662 --> 27:44.361
I've got this under control.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.729
- What
about calling out?

27:45.731 --> 27:46.830
- Nothing works.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.065
Cell phones, walkie,
everything's,

27:48.067 --> 27:50.534
there's no signal.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.736
- This is really
fuckin' bad, man.

27:52.738 --> 27:55.873
Ah, Goddamn, I think
I broke my ass.

27:57.543 --> 27:59.143
- You got a gun?

27:59.145 --> 28:00.544
- Yeah.

28:00.546 --> 28:02.079
- Well let's use it.
- What?

28:02.081 --> 28:03.080
- Get out of the way.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.648
- No, no no.
- Get out of the way.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.183
- Ah fuck, Riley.

28:06.185 --> 28:06.950
Shit, what are you...

28:07.953 --> 28:08.752
- Ah, stop.
- - Shit.

28:08.754 --> 28:09.586
- Just stop.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.724
- Look.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.094
- Ah, shit.

28:19.098 --> 28:22.232
Yeah, that's ah,
that's palladium.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.600
- Riley, you're a fucking idiot.

28:23.602 --> 28:24.835
- Man, just say what?

28:24.837 --> 28:26.303
- Don't talk to
my crew like that.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.038
At least he's doin' something.

28:28.040 --> 28:32.843
- Have you tried playing dead?

28:36.982 --> 28:40.551
- I gotta show you somethin'.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.229
- Blair, I don't get it.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.231
I mean, there's
nothing in this house.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.735
Why would anyone
keep it on lock down?

28:57.737 --> 28:58.969
- It gets worse.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.413
- Great.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.314
What, we gonna pay
Timmy Song back

29:10.316 --> 29:11.648
with with a 200 dollar TV?

29:26.899 --> 29:28.398
So he's into

29:28.400 --> 29:30.134
low-budget slasher flicks.

29:33.472 --> 29:36.039
Really, really big
special effects budgets.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.545
Same place.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.046
- Same place.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.250
Ollie, I'm really scared.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.518
- Blair.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.719
- Let's get out of here.

29:48.721 --> 29:49.920
- I was gonna say I'm
really scared too,

29:49.922 --> 29:51.962
but yeah, let's get
the fuck outta here.

29:55.728 --> 29:57.728
How can Conner's
inside not know this?

29:59.465 --> 30:00.731
Hey.

30:00.733 --> 30:02.866
He had an inside, right?

30:02.868 --> 30:04.788
That's what it
said in the plans.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.837
- No, he lied on the plans.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.238
There's no inside.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.753
Shit.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.056
- Connor!

30:26.058 --> 30:27.090
- Shit.

30:27.092 --> 30:28.425
- It's all your fuckin' fault.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.035
- Sit down.

30:39.305 --> 30:40.804
- You can't punch the leader.

30:40.806 --> 30:42.039
- You are not a leader, okay.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.006
You're a fuck up.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.274
You've always been a fuck up.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.043
- I need you to calm down.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.177
Okay, we need to
figure out a plan

30:47.179 --> 30:54.384
before that sick
fuck comes home.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.424
- What about the skylight?

31:00.426 --> 31:02.326
- That's like 25 feet up.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.627
Even if we stand on each
other's shoulders circus style,

31:03.629 --> 31:05.629
we won't be able to reach it.

31:05.631 --> 31:08.265
- We tried that already.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.501
- Text.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.403
- I thought you said
the signals are blocked.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.505
- I'll just ah, hit send and
throw it to the skylight.

31:15.507 --> 31:16.974
- It's a signal jammer, okay.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.543
We find the jammer, we kill
it, then we call for help.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.211
Look, it's a new
plan guys, all right.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.946
You guys, you sweep this
are out here for the jammer,

31:22.948 --> 31:24.868
Blair and I will
take the bedroom.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.318
- You don't tell me what to do.

31:30.623 --> 31:32.556
- Can you wait for me?

31:38.063 --> 31:38.829
Riley.

31:38.831 --> 31:40.030
- Yeah.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.532
- Hey.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.134
I need you with us, okay.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.436
We gotta find that jammer.

31:50.843 --> 31:51.875
- He's right.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.111
- No.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.145
- I'm a fuck up.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.780
- No, you're not.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.217
We all make mistakes.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.379
Look at me, I'm in deep
with Timmy Song, right.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.522
- I will never let him near you.

32:05.524 --> 32:06.356
Okay?

32:06.358 --> 32:07.358
Ever.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.493
- I know you won't.

32:11.931 --> 32:12.931
Good?

32:15.034 --> 32:16.233
- Yeah.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.805
Riley and I will
sweep this area.

32:21.807 --> 32:22.706
- Thank you.

32:22.708 --> 32:23.373
- Can I have my gun back?

32:23.375 --> 32:24.541
- No.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.463
- Come
on, just, come on.

32:27.079 --> 32:32.015
- You guys know what a
jammer looks like, right?

32:35.854 --> 32:37.894
- Does it
have like a fan on it?

32:38.924 --> 32:40.223
- Fuck.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.492
I knew he'd find a
way to fuck this up.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.560
He always does.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.062
He has not changed at all.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.597
- Ollie, can you
please just stop?

32:47.599 --> 32:49.132
He's still my brother.

32:50.936 --> 32:52.502
- It's not in here.

32:55.708 --> 32:57.474
- What the hell?

32:58.844 --> 33:03.046
I already checked there.

33:07.553 --> 33:08.585
- What?

33:12.124 --> 33:13.957
- Nothing.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.228
- Dude, I'm just sayin',

33:18.230 --> 33:20.130
don't let 'im talk
to you like that.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.131
Fuck 'im.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.232
No, seriously, you say the word,

33:22.234 --> 33:24.267
I'll clan his ass, son.

33:26.739 --> 33:28.338
- Don't worry about
it, all right.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.374
I need you to focus.

33:30.376 --> 33:31.041
Come on, Riley.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.476
Help me out.

33:32.478 --> 33:36.113
There's not even any fuckin'
silverware in this place.

33:40.619 --> 33:41.785
- Oh no.

33:41.787 --> 33:42.853
- What?

33:42.855 --> 33:44.554
What is it?

33:44.556 --> 33:46.723
- There's no beer.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.479
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

33:53.198 --> 33:54.364
Oh shit.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.532
Come on, come on.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.535
- Oh shit.

33:59.638 --> 34:00.837
- Blair, Ollie.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.073
- Did you find it?

34:03.075 --> 34:04.341
- No.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.809
The skylight is sealed shut.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.811
- How did you open
it in the first place?

34:07.813 --> 34:08.945
- It was already wide open.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.246
I just went through.

34:11.516 --> 34:12.549
- Us too.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.252
- He's back.

34:15.254 --> 34:16.453
- Yeah, well we
got a fuckin' gun.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.353
Why don't we use it?

34:17.356 --> 34:18.554
- There's only one bullet.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.597
- Riley, how many
bullets did you bring?

34:21.827 --> 34:23.226
- Well, you only need one bullet

34:23.228 --> 34:24.960
to take 'em out, right?

34:24.963 --> 34:26.063
- Technically that's true.

34:26.065 --> 34:27.097
So here's the plan.

34:27.099 --> 34:27.998
- No way.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.433
Guns and Riley don't mix.

34:29.435 --> 34:30.934
- Will you stop
insulting my crew?

34:30.936 --> 34:32.536
- You guys, no new plans.

34:32.538 --> 34:33.603
We stay together,

34:33.605 --> 34:35.405
and we find the jammer, okay.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.706
- Where?

34:36.708 --> 34:38.875
We already checked everywhere.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.813
- Not everywhere.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.152
- Damn it.

34:49.822 --> 34:51.221
I got nothing.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.121
- That's because
it's not down here.

34:52.123 --> 34:53.456
- Shhh!

34:53.458 --> 34:54.558
- Blair, give me the gun.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.659
- No.

34:55.661 --> 34:56.993
- Well then give Riley the gun.

34:56.995 --> 34:57.928
- My gun.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.930
- Yeah, it's his gun.

34:59.932 --> 35:01.865
Now look, I'm making an
executive decision here.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.333
We're gonna go after
this sick fuck,

35:03.335 --> 35:05.001
and we're gonna take him out.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.069
- Are you fucking kidding me?

35:06.071 --> 35:07.370
We just saw what
he's capable of.

35:07.372 --> 35:09.873
I'm not going after
him with one bullet.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.174
- Blair.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.713
I found something.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.817
I bet you the
jammer's down here.

35:20.819 --> 35:21.985
- No.

35:21.987 --> 35:22.786
Ah.

35:22.788 --> 35:23.887
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

35:23.889 --> 35:24.688
- Ah, that's right.

35:24.690 --> 35:25.622
You're claustrophobic.

35:25.624 --> 35:26.756
- Fuck claustrophobia.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.325
Dude, you never
ever go into a dark

35:28.327 --> 35:30.927
underground layer.

35:30.929 --> 35:31.728
- That's
the smartest thing

35:31.730 --> 35:33.363
I've ever heard you say.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.664
Ever.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.199
- Stop
insulting my crew.

35:36.201 --> 35:37.200
- I was
complimenting him.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.001
- I what you doin'.

35:38.003 --> 35:39.202
Thank you.

35:39.204 --> 35:39.970
- Riley, you
want your gun back?

35:39.972 --> 35:41.271
- Yeah.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.174
- You can have
it if you go first.

35:44.176 --> 35:45.675
- Are you sure?

35:46.712 --> 35:47.712
- Deal?

35:49.815 --> 35:53.116
- Let's just get this over with.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.321
- Hey, you know who
always dies first

35:58.323 --> 35:59.456
in these situations?

36:00.592 --> 36:02.626
The black guy.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.601
- What the
fuck is this place?

36:16.008 --> 36:17.407
- What is that?

36:23.348 --> 36:24.414
- Blair.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.849
- Sorry, sorry.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.651
- You still do that?

36:27.653 --> 36:28.885
She laughs when she's scared.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.787
- Dude, I thought
it was a ghost.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.289
- Really?

36:32.291 --> 36:33.790
A ghost?

36:35.527 --> 36:36.960
- I'm afraid of ghosts, okay.

36:39.598 --> 36:40.931
- Riley, keep going.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.432
- Okay, okay, okay.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.203
- Wait a second.

36:46.205 --> 36:47.470
- What?

36:49.541 --> 36:51.621
- What do you think
are behind these doors?

36:53.045 --> 36:54.578
- Oh, you know.

36:54.580 --> 36:57.080
Cleaning supplies, toilet paper.

36:58.217 --> 36:59.416
- Really?

36:59.418 --> 37:00.116
- No!

37:00.118 --> 37:01.251
Not really.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.319
- Connor, sssh.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.253
- You idiot.

37:03.255 --> 37:05.388
- Don't talk to me like that.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.023
I'm your crew.

37:07.025 --> 37:08.758
- Riley,
just, keep going.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.760
- Okay.

37:12.798 --> 37:13.997
Oh shit.

37:15.834 --> 37:16.666
- Gimme that.

37:16.668 --> 37:17.934
- No.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.103
What the fuck?

37:21.573 --> 37:22.505
- What was that?

37:22.507 --> 37:23.673
- Find the jammer.

37:23.675 --> 37:24.975
- Wait.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.278
- Riley!

37:30.449 --> 37:31.147
Fuck, it's a dead end.

37:31.149 --> 37:31.948
- Okay, okay.

37:31.950 --> 37:32.849
I think we're done here.

37:32.851 --> 37:33.783
We need to go back upstairs.

37:33.785 --> 37:34.651
I don't wanna anger the spirits.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.586
- Agreed, agreed.
Okay.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.487
- Wait, wait.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.056
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.058
Do you see that?

37:43.161 --> 37:46.162
- What?

37:53.939 --> 37:55.472
I think this is it.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.640
Is that it?

37:56.642 --> 37:58.608
- Yeah,
it looks like it.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.530
- How do
you turn it off?

38:04.683 --> 38:05.982
- Yep, that works.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.050
- Okay.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.251
I think it's off.

38:08.253 --> 38:08.918
- Everyone
try your phones.

38:08.920 --> 38:09.586
- Okay.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.353
Who do we call?

38:10.355 --> 38:12.255
- 3-1-1.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.124
- Call 9-1-1.

38:14.126 --> 38:14.924
- No.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.459
We can't call the cops.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.228
Dude, you are on
your third strike.

38:18.230 --> 38:19.296
I'm on my fourth.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.163
- He's right.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.165
You can't go back.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.600
- You guys, we have to,

38:23.602 --> 38:25.962
we have to worry about getting
out of here alive first.

38:27.272 --> 38:29.372
- Stupid phone.

38:29.374 --> 38:30.540
I should have upgraded
this piece of shit,

38:30.542 --> 38:32.542
but no, I had to
save money for boobs.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.378
- I have one bar.

38:40.252 --> 38:41.951
- 911
Sheriff's Department.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.153
- Hello.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.421
Sheriff's Department.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.156
- I'm in a house at the
very end of Sange Road.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.892
There's, there's four of us.

38:48.894 --> 38:49.926
We're being held against our-

38:49.928 --> 38:51.061
- Department...

38:51.063 --> 38:53.029
- I'm a white person!

38:53.031 --> 38:54.264
Shit.

38:56.335 --> 38:58.101
I don't know if it went through.

38:58.970 --> 38:59.769
- Let's go upstairs.

38:59.771 --> 39:00.870
Okay.

39:00.871 --> 39:01.970
Stay together.
Go upstairs.

39:01.973 --> 39:02.872
- Yeah, I like that idea.

39:27.632 --> 39:29.065
- Hello.

39:31.103 --> 39:33.103
Is someone there?

39:35.173 --> 39:37.340
My name is Vivian Thorpe.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.912
I have been a prisoner in here

39:42.914 --> 39:45.081
for weeks now.

39:49.421 --> 39:50.487
- Wait.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.322
We have to get a signal first.

39:52.324 --> 39:53.189
- Blair, we gotta help her.

39:53.191 --> 39:53.990
- We're gonna help her,

39:53.992 --> 39:54.791
but we can't help anyone

39:54.793 --> 39:56.025
until we get a signal.

39:56.027 --> 39:56.960
- It's gonna take two
seconds to get our-

39:56.962 --> 39:58.161
- Both of you stop.

39:58.163 --> 39:58.962
Blair's right.

39:58.964 --> 39:59.796
- Connor, shut up.

39:59.798 --> 40:00.897
- I'll help her.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.366
Riley and I got this.

40:03.368 --> 40:05.201
- Hey, what?

40:05.203 --> 40:06.736
- No.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.772
- Right?

40:09.841 --> 40:10.640
- Fuck it.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.742
Let's do it.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.543
- We're staying together.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.412
- Just go find a signal.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.346
Go.

40:16.348 --> 40:17.013
- We'll go, we'll go.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.848
- No.

40:18.849 --> 40:20.682
- Wait.
The door.

40:20.685 --> 40:21.751
- Spirits.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.519
- Oh, no no no.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.420
- Connor!

40:23.422 --> 40:24.087
- Yeah.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.155
- Are you okay?

40:25.157 --> 40:26.856
- Yeah, we're fine.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.324
Look, we're gonna,

40:28.326 --> 40:30.093
we're gonna figure out how
to get her out of that thing,

40:30.095 --> 40:31.127
then we'll find a way out.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.228
Just, find a signal.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.630
- No, we're not leaving you.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.299
- Blair, just go
find a signal, okay.

40:36.301 --> 40:37.534
- We gotta
go, we gotta go.

40:37.536 --> 40:38.735
We'll be back.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.804
- Okay.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.409
Let's get her out of that thing.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.047
- No, no no no no no.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.549
- Shit.

40:52.551 --> 40:56.319
- All right, uh, let's
take a guess signal here.

40:56.321 --> 40:58.087
- My phone's dead.

40:59.724 --> 41:00.690
- Here.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.058
I'm gonna try to get this open.

41:04.729 --> 41:05.862
Okay.

41:05.864 --> 41:06.930
Ready to move?

41:06.932 --> 41:08.264
- No.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.332
- Are you sure?

41:21.146 --> 41:22.445
- Hey.

41:22.447 --> 41:23.413
Hi.

41:23.415 --> 41:24.781
Oh shit.

41:24.783 --> 41:29.486
You okay?

41:33.859 --> 41:35.391
- Who are you?

41:36.461 --> 41:39.028
How did you find this place?

41:40.265 --> 41:42.065
- We're nobody.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.867
We just found it by chance.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.436
- Are you okay?

41:48.139 --> 41:49.539
You need some food?

41:50.742 --> 41:51.841
- Yes.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.911
Please.

41:54.913 --> 41:55.979
- I'm sorry.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.280
I don't have any.

41:58.083 --> 41:59.682
- What?

41:59.684 --> 42:00.817
- What the fuck, Riley?

42:00.819 --> 42:02.185
- No, um, I thought...

42:02.187 --> 42:03.853
- Why would you say that?

42:03.855 --> 42:04.654
- I'm sorry.

42:04.656 --> 42:05.421
I thought that...

42:05.423 --> 42:07.857
- I'm so hungry.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.259
- I thought there was a cracker,

42:09.261 --> 42:10.827
or like some fruit
left or some shit.

42:10.829 --> 42:11.694
I don't know.

42:12.797 --> 42:13.830
- Put that away.

42:13.832 --> 42:14.731
- Oh, I'm sorry.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.099
- Are you here to hurt me?

42:16.101 --> 42:16.866
- No no no.

42:16.868 --> 42:17.800
No no.

42:17.802 --> 42:18.601
No no, we don't wanna hurt you.

42:18.603 --> 42:20.003
Okay.
Not at all.

42:20.005 --> 42:20.703
I'm sorry about him.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.238
- Yeah.

42:23.608 --> 42:27.744
- We're robbers, and we're
stuck down here with you.

42:28.747 --> 42:30.113
- You're robbers?

42:30.115 --> 42:31.748
- Yeah.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.450
- You don't make any sense.

42:34.452 --> 42:36.019
- We were pulling a heist.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.587
I'm the leader.

42:37.589 --> 42:39.055
He's part of my crew.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.377
- Yeah, don't, don't judge
us on our rugged exterior.

42:42.327 --> 42:44.327
- Find anything yet?

42:44.329 --> 42:45.695
- Nothing.

42:45.697 --> 42:47.764
I think we just should
have sent that text.

42:47.766 --> 42:49.699
- Look, it was a
good plan, okay.

42:49.701 --> 42:51.100
We found the jammer,
we killed it,

42:51.102 --> 42:52.368
we could have gotten
a phone call out.

42:52.370 --> 42:55.038
- So no one knows
that you're here?

42:59.311 --> 43:00.510
- No.

43:00.512 --> 43:01.844
- Wait a minute.

43:01.846 --> 43:03.880
Why would you rob this place?

43:04.749 --> 43:06.382
- We, we thought it was legit.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.585
There was no one here.

43:08.587 --> 43:10.587
We watched it for two weeks.

43:10.589 --> 43:12.589
- Oh God.

43:12.591 --> 43:14.290
Oh God.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.559
You're lying to me.

43:16.561 --> 43:18.094
You have to be lying.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.195
- What?

43:19.197 --> 43:21.531
- I don't know
anything about robbing,

43:21.533 --> 43:22.699
but I do know

43:22.701 --> 43:25.768
that two weeks is
not enough time.

43:25.770 --> 43:28.771
- No, two weeks is the
perfect amount of time.

43:28.773 --> 43:30.239
- It's not enough time.

43:30.241 --> 43:31.207
- That's more than enough time.

43:31.209 --> 43:31.908
- Yeah, so much time.

43:31.910 --> 43:32.842
Oh my God.

43:32.844 --> 43:34.360
- We can do a lot in two weeks.

43:34.361 --> 43:35.877
- Plenty of time.
An eternity.

43:35.880 --> 43:36.779
- Hey, you know what?

43:36.781 --> 43:39.482
My driver and our lookout,

43:39.484 --> 43:41.250
they're calling
the cops right now,

43:41.252 --> 43:42.885
so you're gonna be okay.

43:42.887 --> 43:44.053
Everything's over.

43:44.055 --> 43:45.288
Now we just all
need to sit tight.

43:45.290 --> 43:46.489
- What?

43:46.491 --> 43:47.156
No.

43:47.158 --> 43:47.957
No, no no no.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.092
No, we can't do that.

43:49.094 --> 43:50.526
He's gonna be back here.

43:50.528 --> 43:52.128
He's gonna kill us.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.364
You don't understand.

43:54.366 --> 43:55.898
- Who?

43:55.900 --> 43:57.367
- Him.

43:59.204 --> 44:01.604
He's not right in the head.

44:03.408 --> 44:06.242
He did things to me.

44:09.447 --> 44:10.480
- You want a tissue?

44:10.482 --> 44:12.181
Never mind.

44:13.184 --> 44:14.751
- Just
get me out of here.

44:14.753 --> 44:16.152
Please.

44:16.154 --> 44:16.886
- Okay, hey, hey.

44:18.923 --> 44:19.989
- Okay, no no no.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.090
I'm not trying to touch you.

44:21.092 --> 44:22.291
Okay, I don't wanna touch you.

44:22.293 --> 44:23.493
- Don't look at me.

44:23.495 --> 44:24.160
- Okay, we're
not looking at...

44:30.101 --> 44:31.200
- Hey, dude.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.136
Hey dude, dude.

44:33.138 --> 44:34.871
- Hey!
Wait!

44:34.873 --> 44:36.873
Wait, we're just
trying to help you.

44:36.875 --> 44:38.408
Wait, wait.

44:41.246 --> 44:44.847
Riley?

44:44.849 --> 44:45.581
Riley!

44:46.384 --> 44:47.116
- What was that?

44:47.118 --> 44:47.950
- Dude.

44:47.952 --> 44:49.018
- Riley.

44:49.788 --> 44:50.787
- Connor.

44:50.789 --> 44:52.121
- Riley,
what's goin' on?

44:52.123 --> 44:54.057
- Dude.

44:54.059 --> 44:55.291
- Riley, can you hear us?

44:55.293 --> 44:56.559
- Open the door.

44:56.561 --> 44:58.461
- Connor.

44:58.463 --> 44:59.362
- He's not here.

44:59.364 --> 45:00.530
We got separated.

45:00.532 --> 45:02.832
Just help me open
this damn door.

45:02.834 --> 45:03.599
- We're trying.

45:03.601 --> 45:05.168
We can't, we can't.

45:05.170 --> 45:06.335
- Wait.

45:06.337 --> 45:07.470
Hello.

45:09.174 --> 45:10.540
Who's there?

45:10.542 --> 45:11.307
- Riley.

45:11.309 --> 45:12.108
- What's happening?

45:12.110 --> 45:13.543
- Who is it?

45:13.545 --> 45:15.611
- I think there's
someone in here with me.

45:15.613 --> 45:17.380
I can hear you, motherfucker.

45:17.382 --> 45:18.548
- Shit.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.717
- Spirit, is that you?

45:20.719 --> 45:22.285
- No, no Riley,
it's not a spirit.

45:22.287 --> 45:23.519
Can you run?

45:23.521 --> 45:25.755
- Wandering
ghost, I vanish thee.

45:25.757 --> 45:28.558
I, I, I, vanish the from...

45:28.560 --> 45:29.726
Just disappear.

45:29.728 --> 45:31.248
Okay, disappear from
the world forever.

45:31.696 --> 45:32.729
- Riley,
it's not a spirit.

45:32.731 --> 45:33.629
You gotta run.

45:33.631 --> 45:34.731
- I'm warning you.

45:34.733 --> 45:37.066
Leave me alone.

45:38.269 --> 45:39.869
- Riley.

45:42.907 --> 45:44.006
Riley.

45:45.210 --> 45:47.176
- Riley.

45:47.178 --> 45:48.444
Shit.

45:52.617 --> 45:55.184
- Come on, come on, come on.

45:55.186 --> 45:56.886
Help us open the door.

45:58.723 --> 45:59.989
- Riley.

46:02.460 --> 46:03.760
- Tell my girlfriend...

46:06.431 --> 46:08.564
I woulda skipped Mars for her.

46:11.803 --> 46:12.535
- Riley.

46:12.537 --> 46:14.103
- Riley.

46:21.613 --> 46:28.351
Get back, get back.

46:34.359 --> 46:35.324
Oh my God.

46:35.326 --> 46:36.225
- Riley.

46:36.227 --> 46:37.860
- Riley.

46:41.399 --> 46:42.899
- It's not a ghost.

46:44.435 --> 46:45.435
It's...

46:46.671 --> 46:47.671
A...

46:48.873 --> 46:50.773
- Oh shit.

46:50.775 --> 46:51.474
Come on, we gotta go.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.576
Ready?
Ready, go.

46:53.578 --> 46:55.912
- Ollie!

46:56.981 --> 46:59.282
I thought you were with me.

46:59.284 --> 47:01.217
- Sorry.

47:01.219 --> 47:02.518
- Is he dead?

47:04.222 --> 47:06.455
- I can't tell.

47:06.457 --> 47:08.090
Riley.

47:15.700 --> 47:17.400
- Riley.

47:21.706 --> 47:22.772
- Help me.

47:22.774 --> 47:24.841
- Grab it, go.

47:24.843 --> 47:25.908
We got you, Riley.

47:36.454 --> 47:38.254
Riley, Riley, get up.

47:38.256 --> 47:39.222
Get up.

47:39.224 --> 47:40.957
Riley.

47:40.959 --> 47:42.525
Riley.

47:42.527 --> 47:43.926
Something's wrong.

47:46.364 --> 47:49.131
- He's dead!

47:49.133 --> 47:50.299
- Oh shit!

47:50.301 --> 47:51.133
Oh shit.

47:51.135 --> 47:52.668
Ah!

47:52.670 --> 47:54.370
- You left
the back door open!

48:00.245 --> 48:01.110
- Shit.

48:01.112 --> 48:04.580
Look, are you okay?

48:08.853 --> 48:11.487
- What is this place?

48:16.227 --> 48:19.762
- This is where he has his fun.

48:23.902 --> 48:25.134
Look, we gotta find a weapon.

48:25.136 --> 48:31.173
All right?

48:35.446 --> 48:41.550
There's nothing here.

48:45.189 --> 48:47.556
- What are you gonna
do with that tiny knife?

48:52.063 --> 48:52.728
- Who are you?

48:52.730 --> 48:53.896
Who are you?
- No, no.

48:53.898 --> 48:54.730
Wait.

48:54.732 --> 48:56.632
- Stay away, stay away.

48:57.602 --> 48:58.634
- We're not gonna hurt you.

48:58.636 --> 49:01.404
It was Vivian, right?

49:01.406 --> 49:02.605
- Yeah.

49:02.607 --> 49:03.306
- Where's that guy
that was with you?

49:03.308 --> 49:05.741
- I don't know.

49:05.743 --> 49:06.842
I don't know him.

49:06.844 --> 49:07.844
He was...

49:08.680 --> 49:09.645
He was behind me.

49:09.647 --> 49:11.147
- Gimme your phone.

49:21.659 --> 49:23.092
- You have a phone?

49:24.529 --> 49:26.629
Did you call someone?

49:26.631 --> 49:29.298
- We did, we, got a call out.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.733
- Are they coming?

49:30.735 --> 49:31.968
- We're not sure.

49:33.271 --> 49:34.503
- They're not coming.

49:34.505 --> 49:37.139
- The signal was
in and out, but,

49:37.141 --> 49:39.061
it still might
have gone through.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.644
Look, Vivian, we need
to find a way out.

49:41.646 --> 49:43.179
- I can't.

49:43.181 --> 49:44.380
I can't.

49:44.382 --> 49:46.148
- Do you
know of anything,

49:46.150 --> 49:47.316
any way out?

49:47.318 --> 49:49.198
- Are you sure he
was behind you?

49:50.188 --> 49:51.188
- Yes.

50:04.769 --> 50:06.535
- I don't trust her.

50:06.537 --> 50:08.004
- What do you mean?

50:08.006 --> 50:09.572
- I just...

50:09.574 --> 50:11.173
I have a bad
feeling about it, I,

50:11.175 --> 50:13.542
we need to find
some rope with her.

50:13.544 --> 50:15.644
- Blair, she's been kidnapped...

50:15.646 --> 50:16.579
- I know.

50:16.581 --> 50:17.246
- She's probably traumatized.

50:17.248 --> 50:18.414
- I know that,

50:18.416 --> 50:20.750
but she's been here
for weeks, right?

50:20.752 --> 50:23.052
I'm pretty sure that's a
fresh pedicure on her feet.

50:25.423 --> 50:27.790
- You're basing all of
this on nail polish?

50:27.792 --> 50:28.792
- Yeah.

50:32.764 --> 50:34.096
- Did you get a good look?

50:34.098 --> 50:35.798
- Yeah.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.166
I know.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.701
I think so.

50:41.172 --> 50:43.873
- Maybe she got a gel pedi
before she got kidnapped.

50:45.376 --> 50:47.276
- How do you know it?

50:47.278 --> 50:48.611
It doesn't matter, I just...

50:49.247 --> 50:52.281
I think, I think maybe
we should tie her up.

50:53.051 --> 50:54.016
- Tie her up?

50:54.018 --> 50:55.885
Are you listening to yourself?

50:58.756 --> 51:00.056
She's been tortured.

51:01.993 --> 51:02.792
No, I'm not doing it.

51:02.794 --> 51:03.759
I'm not doing it.

51:03.761 --> 51:04.460
- Are you guys robbers?

51:09.700 --> 51:11.233
- Sorry, Vivian, we...

51:14.672 --> 51:16.105
Who told you we were robbers?

51:17.909 --> 51:18.941
- Your leader.

51:20.978 --> 51:22.845
He wasn't very good.

51:22.847 --> 51:23.847
- Connor.

51:26.084 --> 51:27.316
- I think it's my fault.

51:29.153 --> 51:30.820
I think I took a wrong turn.

51:30.822 --> 51:32.154
I don't know.

51:32.156 --> 51:33.489
- Do you know where he is?

51:35.259 --> 51:36.258
- Maybe.

51:36.260 --> 51:38.060
- Can you show me?

51:38.062 --> 51:39.562
- Yeah.

51:39.564 --> 51:40.963
- Blair, be careful.

51:40.965 --> 51:42.665
- Wait, where's the knife?
- - Connor.

51:42.667 --> 51:43.799
- Connor.

51:45.236 --> 51:46.001
- Blair!

51:46.003 --> 51:46.735
- Connor!

51:46.737 --> 51:47.436
- Wait.

51:47.438 --> 51:48.637
- No.
Blair!

51:48.639 --> 51:50.239
Wait.

51:50.241 --> 51:51.941
Oh fuck.

51:51.943 --> 51:52.842
Blair.

51:52.844 --> 51:53.843
Blair, what's happening?

51:53.845 --> 51:54.777
- Ollie.

51:54.779 --> 51:55.978
- Blair, what's goin' on?

52:00.518 --> 52:01.884
Blair.

52:04.155 --> 52:06.922
- Vivian.

52:11.329 --> 52:13.329
What is that?

52:13.331 --> 52:14.563
- I don't know.

52:18.703 --> 52:20.369
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

52:20.371 --> 52:21.604
I have to.

52:21.606 --> 52:22.371
- No, don't do that.

52:22.373 --> 52:23.305
- I see it.

52:23.307 --> 52:24.140
- Don't, don't do that.

52:30.481 --> 52:31.847
- Quick.
Blair.

52:31.849 --> 52:33.215
Hold on.

52:33.217 --> 52:34.383
Hold on, okay.

52:39.857 --> 52:41.790
- Ollie, get us outta here!

52:48.232 --> 52:49.265
Please hurry!

52:49.267 --> 52:50.032
- What's happening?

52:50.034 --> 52:51.267
What's going on?

52:51.269 --> 52:52.601
- Ollie, Blair!

52:52.603 --> 52:54.203
- Connor!

52:54.205 --> 52:55.638
Connor!

52:55.640 --> 52:56.839
- Connor!

52:56.841 --> 52:58.641
- Connor!

52:58.643 --> 53:00.142
- Yeah, it's me.

53:00.144 --> 53:01.210
Are you okay?

53:01.212 --> 53:02.144
- I'm okay.

53:02.146 --> 53:03.712
I'm with Vivian and I'm...

53:03.714 --> 53:05.181
We got separated from Ollie.

53:05.183 --> 53:07.049
He's in the room next door.

53:07.051 --> 53:08.417
- It's him.

53:08.419 --> 53:10.252
He's doing it on purpose.

53:10.254 --> 53:11.987
Where's Riley?

53:13.891 --> 53:15.224
- He's dead.

53:16.494 --> 53:19.295
- Okay, listen.

53:19.297 --> 53:21.797
He needs help.

53:21.799 --> 53:24.099
Tell Ollie I don't wanna
be the leader anymore.

53:24.101 --> 53:26.335
He can be the leader,
okay, 'cause I just...

53:26.337 --> 53:27.570
I don't, wait...

53:29.707 --> 53:31.707
I think somebody's
in here with me.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.375
Hello?

53:33.377 --> 53:35.044
- What's happening?

53:36.214 --> 53:36.979
- Blair, what's happening?

53:36.981 --> 53:38.781
What's going on?

53:38.783 --> 53:40.249
- Somebody's
in here, Blair.

53:40.251 --> 53:41.383
- Oh, God, Connor.

53:41.385 --> 53:43.052
It's not a ghost, okay.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.787
You have to run.

53:44.789 --> 53:46.021
- Why would I
think it's a ghost, Blair?

53:46.023 --> 53:46.689
Come on!

53:46.691 --> 53:48.424
Whoa!
Blair!

53:50.595 --> 53:51.527
- No, Blair, no!

53:51.529 --> 53:53.495
Connor!

53:53.497 --> 53:55.731
- Don't you touch
him, you motherfucker!

53:58.369 --> 54:00.803
Connor!

54:03.808 --> 54:04.974
Connor!

54:23.127 --> 54:24.793
- What the hell is that?

54:29.200 --> 54:30.499
Blair, the cops.

54:30.501 --> 54:31.333
Blair, the cops are here.

54:31.335 --> 54:32.468
We...

54:32.470 --> 54:34.403
The phone call
went through, hon.

54:34.405 --> 54:42.405
We have to warn 'em.

54:52.857 --> 54:54.923
- Can you
get the door open?

54:54.925 --> 54:56.091
- Blair, I have an idea.

54:56.093 --> 54:57.926
Okay?

55:01.632 --> 55:07.102
We have to stay away
from the wall, all right?

55:11.409 --> 55:12.708
Okay, here we go.

55:12.710 --> 55:14.476
Ready?

55:14.478 --> 55:15.644
Oh shit.

55:17.715 --> 55:19.748
Come on, come on, come on.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.251
It's not working.

55:22.253 --> 55:23.652
- I have an idea.

55:23.654 --> 55:25.020
- Okay, hurry.

55:28.326 --> 55:29.526
He's talking to the sheriff.

55:33.297 --> 55:34.530
- I sure do appreciate you

55:34.532 --> 55:36.612
letting me take a look
around, Mr. Tucker.

55:38.202 --> 55:39.202
- Please.

55:40.137 --> 55:41.704
Call me Jack.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.160
Ain't no problem
at all, Sheriff.

55:46.544 --> 55:49.745
Anything I can do to help.

55:58.255 --> 55:59.588
- It's working.

56:00.458 --> 56:05.728
Come on.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.500
Are you all right, hon?

56:11.502 --> 56:13.001
Did he hurt you?

56:16.107 --> 56:17.740
I'm sorry, look...

56:17.742 --> 56:18.974
The sheriff's
upstairs, all right.

56:18.976 --> 56:20.776
We have to warn him.

56:22.947 --> 56:23.812
I need you to help
me open the door.

56:23.814 --> 56:25.581
Can you do that?

56:25.583 --> 56:26.882
Okay.

56:28.386 --> 56:29.651
I'm gonna hook this
out through the door.

56:29.653 --> 56:30.853
- Okay.

56:30.855 --> 56:32.935
- Then you
turn it on, all right.

56:34.825 --> 56:37.259
- Catch you a
cup of coffee, Sheriff?

56:39.130 --> 56:40.396
Homemade iced tea?

56:40.398 --> 56:41.797
- No, thank you.

56:53.210 --> 56:54.343
I'm sorry.

56:54.345 --> 56:56.445
How long did you
say you lived here?

56:58.149 --> 56:59.381
- I didn't.

57:00.818 --> 57:02.284
- Well, how long?

57:03.387 --> 57:05.087
- Long time.

57:05.089 --> 57:07.689
- And not a lot of decorations

57:07.691 --> 57:10.325
in this nice house.

57:10.327 --> 57:13.395
- No, never had that
for that kind of thing.

57:13.397 --> 57:15.264
- Is that right?

57:15.266 --> 57:17.266
- Well, my wife Betty, she...

57:17.268 --> 57:23.572
She took care of all that
stuff before she passed on.

57:27.411 --> 57:32.281
- Nothing quite like
a woman's touch, huh.

57:36.454 --> 57:39.021
My wife died just last year.

57:39.957 --> 57:41.990
- Well, my condolences, Sheriff.

57:44.228 --> 57:46.295
Suppose it'll get
better with time.

57:47.264 --> 57:48.997
I mean, that's
what they deal ya.

57:48.999 --> 57:51.533
- That's what they tell ya.

57:51.535 --> 57:52.634
- Yep.

57:53.971 --> 57:55.204
- Well...

57:56.640 --> 57:58.407
Sorry to take your time, Jack.

57:59.577 --> 58:01.109
You have a good day.

58:08.252 --> 58:09.918
- We're almost there.

58:15.159 --> 58:18.861
Wait.

58:25.169 --> 58:26.201
Oh shit.

58:28.939 --> 58:29.738
No, forget it.

58:29.740 --> 58:33.709
Let's go, let's go!

58:38.249 --> 58:39.348
Come on.

58:39.350 --> 58:41.016
Look, baby, we're so close.

58:41.018 --> 58:43.085
You can do this.
Let's go.

58:43.087 --> 58:44.353
- I can't.

58:44.355 --> 58:46.889
- Vivian, how long have
you been down here?

58:46.891 --> 58:48.323
- Weeks.

58:48.325 --> 58:49.791
Once, I don't know.

58:49.793 --> 58:50.792
- This is your
chance to get out.

58:50.794 --> 58:52.127
We have to go.

58:54.398 --> 58:56.265
- I cant.

58:58.068 --> 58:58.834
- Fuck it.

58:58.836 --> 58:59.768
Leave her.

58:59.770 --> 59:02.638
- You can't leave her.

59:06.443 --> 59:08.563
- Beautiful
land you got out here.

59:09.246 --> 59:10.846
- Thank you kindly.

59:13.984 --> 59:16.318
- I guess
it was just kids

59:16.320 --> 59:18.453
playing around with the phone.

59:19.723 --> 59:21.256
Take care.

59:22.159 --> 59:25.093
- Sorry you had to drive
all this way, Sheriff.

59:25.095 --> 59:26.028
- Don't go!

59:26.030 --> 59:26.895
- Wait, wait!

59:26.897 --> 59:28.697
- What the hell?

59:28.699 --> 59:30.732
Stay where you are!

59:30.734 --> 59:31.967
- Wait, we're
trapped in the house.

59:31.969 --> 59:33.502
- Stay where you are.

59:33.504 --> 59:34.436
- The pair of dead
bodies inside.

59:34.438 --> 59:35.504
Our friends, okay.

59:41.979 --> 59:43.178
Blair.

59:43.180 --> 59:45.247
I'm sorry, she does
that when she's scared.

59:45.249 --> 59:48.050
- Everybody down
on the ground now!

59:48.052 --> 59:49.217
Do it.

59:49.219 --> 59:50.152
- Officer, you're
not listening to me.

59:50.154 --> 59:51.086
This man is a murderer, okay.

59:51.088 --> 59:51.853
He killed both of our friends.

59:51.855 --> 59:52.621
- That's a lie.

59:52.623 --> 59:53.755
- Just do what I say,

59:53.757 --> 59:55.591
and we'll sort this out.

59:55.593 --> 59:57.593
- Sheriff.

59:57.595 --> 59:59.328
I couldn't say anything before,

59:59.330 --> 01:00:01.630
but, they've been
holding me hostage,

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:03.465
and they're robbin' my house.

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:04.566
- That's a fuckin' lie.

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:05.334
Don't believe him.

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:07.069
- Everybody shut up!

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:11.273
You will talk only
when I say so.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:12.374
Is that clear?

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:13.141
- Officer, you
gotta listen to me.

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:14.343
- Shut up.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:20.182
Take these, cuff
yourselves to that post

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:22.284
right over there.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.051
- What about him?

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:24.019
- He said shut up.

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:24.786
- You shut up.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:25.554
- No, you shut up.

01:00:25.556 --> 01:00:27.089
- Everybody shut up!

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:30.726
Let me take care
of him, all right?

01:00:30.728 --> 01:00:32.494
Just do what I say.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.734
- Look officer, you're
making a mistake, okay.

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:40.736
You need to cuff that
man up right now.

01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:44.259
- All right, let
me see the cuffs.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.475
Give 'em a tug.

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:50.979
Dispatch, I got a
situation over here.

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:54.282
- The jammer.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:55.717
- Angie come back.

01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:57.119
- Officer, you can't
get a call out,

01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:58.453
because this man,

01:00:58.455 --> 01:00:59.554
he has a jammer inside.

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:00.756
Look, we, we turned it off,

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:01.990
but he must have
turned it back on.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:02.958
- Be quiet.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.960
- What's a jammer?

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:06.662
I don't even have a phone.

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:07.763
- Son of a bitch.

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:08.964
- All right.

01:01:08.966 --> 01:01:10.832
Now he said that the two of you

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.300
we're trying to rob him.

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:13.301
Is that true?

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:15.103
- No.
- Yes.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:16.505
- Officer, yes, it's true.

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:17.973
We broke into his
house to rob him, okay,

01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:20.008
but, he's been keeping
us against our will,

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.310
underground in a torture den.

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:24.112
- An underground torture den?

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:24.913
- There's a secret door.

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:25.647
If you look inside...

01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:26.615
- Secret door?

01:01:26.617 --> 01:01:27.516
- In the basement, a secret...

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:29.985
- Let me get this straight.

01:01:29.987 --> 01:01:32.554
The two of you were
trying to rob the house

01:01:32.556 --> 01:01:34.723
of some kind of serial killer?

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:35.724
This man?

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:36.892
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:38.660
- Do I look like Sheriff
dumb dumb to you?

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:39.428
- Yes.
- No.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:40.762
- Oh no you didn't.

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:41.730
- Listen, it doesn't matter.

01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:43.131
Arrest all of us, okay.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.166
- Just take us with you.

01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:45.767
Just get us out of here.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:50.339
- Help me!

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.207
- Don't trust her!

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.642
- No, wait.

01:01:53.644 --> 01:01:54.943
- They're with me.

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:56.378
They saved me.

01:01:58.415 --> 01:01:59.681
It's him.

01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:03.118
He's been keeping me
prisoner for weeks.

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:05.120
- You.

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:07.489
Get your face on the
ground right now.

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:09.458
- He's a psychopath.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.393
He did things to me.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:13.295
- I told you she's innocent.

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:15.130
- My God, are you all right?

01:02:15.132 --> 01:02:17.432
C'mere, it's gonna be okay.

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:18.767
- Just take me away.

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:19.835
Oh God.

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:21.403
- C'mere.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.571
Angie.

01:02:22.573 --> 01:02:24.372
Angie, I need backup right now.

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:28.617
- It's over, I can't
believe it's over.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:31.813
Ow.

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:33.048
- Pick the lock.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.150
- Why?

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:36.151
- Those videos that we saw,

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:37.753
who was holding the camera?

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:40.188
There was someone
else in the room.

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:46.628
- Angie, I
need back up right now.

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:48.130
You copy?

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:49.564
Angie?

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:54.437
- Run!

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:57.939
- Oh shit.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:02:58.774
Other way, other way.

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:07.376
Go, go go go.
Go.

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:16.758
Are you okay?

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.492
Are you with me?

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:23.031
- No, no no.
I'm okay.

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:23.698
- Oh shit.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.933
Shit.

01:03:55.899 --> 01:03:58.166
- Don't go anywhere.

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:01.369
I'll be right back.

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:07.342
Bye.

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:19.975
- I fucking told
you she was evil.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:43.712
- Blair, we um,

01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:45.013
we need to barricade the doors.

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:46.815
All right?

01:04:46.817 --> 01:04:48.416
We need to barricade
the doors, we need to

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:49.885
buy some time.

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:50.685
All right?

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:51.786
We gotta keep moving.

01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:53.255
Look, they're calculated
killers, okay.

01:04:53.257 --> 01:04:55.557
Blair, look, if someone comes
looking for the sheriff...

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:57.592
They're gonna wanna make sure

01:04:57.594 --> 01:04:59.127
there aren't any signs

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:00.829
that anything happened.

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:01.596
Okay?

01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:02.898
So, that means that,

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.699
they're gonna have
to hide his body,

01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:06.368
or hide his patrol car,

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.937
and hide our van.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.940
Okay, so there's some time.

01:05:11.942 --> 01:05:12.807
There's a little bit of time.

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:14.242
Okay?

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:17.279
Look, that wasn't
our last chance.

01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:18.480
There's uh,

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:19.581
there's gotta be
another way out.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:20.649
We could've missed something.

01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:22.350
All right?

01:05:25.822 --> 01:05:27.188
Look, here's the plan.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.290
We're gonna...

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:31.092
Um, start a fire

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:31.893
in the kitchen,

01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:33.395
and it'll distract them.

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:35.430
Then we'll run.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:41.136
- There is no plan.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.242
What are you gonna do with that?

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:51.846
- I don't know.

01:06:03.727 --> 01:06:05.767
- I shouldn't have
borrowed that money.

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:08.630
- No, Blair, this
is not your fault.

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:09.965
Okay?

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:11.266
It's not.

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:16.905
All right.

01:06:16.907 --> 01:06:19.174
Two kids come back
from Christmas break.

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:21.843
The first kid says
to the second kid,

01:06:21.845 --> 01:06:23.345
I had the best Christmas ever.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:26.214
Got a new XBOX with
every single game for it,

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:27.582
a new bicycle,

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:30.485
season tickets to my
favorite basketball team.

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:32.754
What did you get?

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:36.191
Second kid says, I
only got a sweater.

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:39.194
First kid says, why.

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:40.462
Second kid says...

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:43.331
It's because I don't
have cancer, Jimmy.

01:06:48.905 --> 01:06:50.472
I know you're scared.

01:06:50.474 --> 01:06:52.474
- No, it's...

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:53.942
Actually kind of funny.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.520
I'm pregnant.

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:10.058
- What?

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:10.892
- Oh my God.

01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:12.627
I'm not.

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:14.129
I...

01:07:14.131 --> 01:07:16.531
I just wanted to know what it
would feel like to say that.

01:07:19.836 --> 01:07:21.970
That's why I wanted to retire.

01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:26.975
Sorry.

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:28.810
- No, I'm sorry.

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:30.111
I'm so sorry, Blair.

01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:33.815
Look, I shouldn't a...

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:36.884
I shouldn't have pushed
us to do all those jobs.

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:39.387
I shouldn't have
gone back into that

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.122
fucking house.

01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:47.662
I should have put you first.

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:50.265
- Hello friends!

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:54.202
Are we having fun yet?

01:07:54.204 --> 01:07:56.037
- Listen, this is what's
gonna happen, all right.

01:07:56.039 --> 01:07:57.972
They're gonna come in,
I'm gonna lure them away,

01:07:57.974 --> 01:07:59.874
you find a safe place to hide
until somebody gets here.

01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:01.109
- I'm not leaving you.

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:02.310
- No, they're gonna
come for the sheriff,

01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:03.211
so you gotta stay
alive until then.

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:04.813
- We have to stay together.

01:08:04.815 --> 01:08:06.648
Please.

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:07.782
Please.

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:09.517
- You have to swear to me

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:11.386
that you'll run and hide, okay?

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:13.088
Swear to me.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.756
It's the only way, Blair.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:17.492
Blair, come on, you
know it's the only way.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:24.532
Okay.

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:28.036
- Okay.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.741
- I love you, okay.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:35.676
Get ready to run and hide.

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.212
Oh Jesus!
Get back.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:37.946
- Oh my God, Connor.

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:39.613
- Ow.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:40.515
- Sorry.

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:41.448
- Come on, hurry.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:42.517
Go downstairs, go downstairs.

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:43.685
Hurry.

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:44.886
- Why are
we going downstairs?

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:47.755
- I need to
show you something.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:53.715
- We got
you, we got you.

01:08:54.865 --> 01:08:56.029
Let's go, let's go.

01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:58.299
- How did you?

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:02.069
- I heard the buzz,
then I played dead.

01:09:03.406 --> 01:09:05.173
- Played dead?

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:06.674
Of course you did.

01:09:07.777 --> 01:09:10.011
Oh wait.
Connor, I...

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:12.514
- Riley.

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:13.848
I'm so sorry.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:16.917
Thought I'd say goodbye.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:22.590
Hey.

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:25.528
I'm sorry, man.

01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:31.633
You were the best
crew I've ever had.

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:32.767
Listen...

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.837
If I get out of here,

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:38.238
I swear to you,

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:39.941
I swear to you,

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:42.042
I'm gonna buy your
girl those boobs.

01:09:44.447 --> 01:09:45.712
I love you, bro.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.117
- Oh, Connor.

01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:51.419
No!

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:56.090
- It's all right, it's
all right, it's all right.

01:09:56.092 --> 01:09:57.292
It's all right.

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:59.254
I should have told
you I tried that.

01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:01.696
- All right, come on man.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:03.164
We gotta move, we gotta move.

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:04.098
- What are we gonna do?

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.340
We gonna hide and wait it out?

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:07.435
- You gotta see this.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.075
Look at this.

01:10:14.077 --> 01:10:15.997
This is how they're
separating us.

01:10:17.614 --> 01:10:19.547
You can control the
doors from here.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:20.549
Watch.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:24.819
- There they are.

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:26.020
- Yeah.

01:10:26.022 --> 01:10:27.555
- They don't even
care we're down here.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:28.456
- Yeah, but they don't know

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:29.657
that we know about this room.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:31.025
Not yet.

01:10:31.027 --> 01:10:32.260
Now look, I've...

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:33.995
I've been monitoring
surveillance, okay,

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:35.563
and I think I found a way out.

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:37.465
- Where?

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:38.233
- Okay, look at this.

01:10:38.235 --> 01:10:39.167
Look at this.

01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:40.535
You see that room right there?

01:10:40.537 --> 01:10:41.469
Those are, those are
drainage ducts right there.

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:42.870
Now, it's a tight squeeze,

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:44.105
but I checked it out,

01:10:44.107 --> 01:10:46.140
and I think you guys
can fit through it.

01:10:46.142 --> 01:10:47.809
- What do you mean you guys?

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:49.210
- Look, I can hide.

01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:50.044
I'll stay here.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:51.079
I'm gonna slow you down.

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.380
- Connor.

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:53.147
- Look, it's the only
way to do this, Blair.

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:54.082
Okay.

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:55.049
You guys, you guys go out,

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:56.851
phone for help and then,

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:58.286
I'll hide down here and-

01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:00.355
- We're not leaving you again.

01:11:01.191 --> 01:11:02.423
- I would leave me.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.559
- No, we're staying.

01:11:07.497 --> 01:11:09.377
How many people
have they killed?

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:11.766
If we leave, they get away,

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:13.534
and they'll kill again.

01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:15.003
We can't live with that.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.972
We should have done what
Connor was saying all along.

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:18.773
- Play dead.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:19.440
- Go on offense.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:20.708
- Go on offense.

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:24.312
- Blair, I know what
you're thinking,

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:26.381
but I am putting you first.

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:29.784
If we don't stop them,
we'll never be safe.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.486
- No, I know.

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:33.621
We have to do the right thing.

01:11:36.226 --> 01:11:38.159
- Hey guys.

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:39.627
Look.

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.729
I know you don't have any
reason to trust me right now,

01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:43.898
but, I think I have a plan.

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:48.736
We should pull a heist on them.

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:19.867
- Shit.

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:25.540
- What happened?

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:27.742
- Tripped.

01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:28.744
- Oh, go go go.

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:32.046
- Blair.

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:34.683
- Okay.

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:38.953
- Shit.

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:04.178
- First door.

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:06.514
- Connor.

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:08.149
- Open the door.

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:08.950
- I don't know.

01:13:08.952 --> 01:13:10.651
Don't just stand there.
C'mon.

01:13:10.653 --> 01:13:11.786
- Open the door.

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:13.955
- Wrong door.

01:13:13.957 --> 01:13:16.524
- Wrong door, Connor.
C'mon.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:17.959
- I'm trying.

01:13:17.961 --> 01:13:18.993
- Hurry.

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:22.363
- Second door.

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:23.631
Go on, second door.

01:13:24.868 --> 01:13:26.267
- Shit.

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:27.535
- Connor!

01:13:36.312 --> 01:13:40.982
- Fuck you both.

01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:46.621
Oh shit.

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:49.857
- Ollie.

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:50.591
Oh good.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.393
You're with me.

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.670
- Connor,
close the doors.

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:09.877
- Damn it.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:15.583
Shit.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:17.819
Oh.

01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:33.568
Shit.

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:43.277
- Connor, open the door.

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:49.150
- Oh, I got him.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:50.318
Blair, I got 'im.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.240
Shit, okay, wait,
I don't got 'im.

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:15.376
- Splish splash.

01:15:16.746 --> 01:15:18.012
Oh shit.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:22.850
Thanks.

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:48.276
- Hey.

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:00.821
Are you okay?

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:31.098
What were you
gonna do with that?

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:36.090
Are you okay?

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:38.960
- I think I broke a rib.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:40.661
- Oh God.

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:41.429
- Ow, ow ow.

01:16:41.431 --> 01:16:42.129
Blair.

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:43.130
- I'm sorry.

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:44.565
I thought that would help.

01:16:44.567 --> 01:16:46.500
- Ollie, Blair.

01:16:46.502 --> 01:16:48.202
- Connor, we're in here.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:51.205
- Hey.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:56.544
Hey.

01:16:56.546 --> 01:16:58.212
Are you guys okay?

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:00.815
Holy shit.

01:17:00.817 --> 01:17:01.983
It worked.

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:03.918
- Yeah.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.020
Good plan.

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:08.102
- Okay, I thought we'd
all be dead by now.

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:11.359
Yeah, we're not, so...

01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:13.961
- Where's Vivian?

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.096
- I don't know.

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:16.430
She was...

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:20.935
- Ollie!

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:31.679
Did you get her?

01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:34.815
- Yeah, I don't know.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:37.018
I don't know.

01:17:46.295 --> 01:17:49.964
- Holy shit!

01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:55.169
- Okay, can we leave now?

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.104
Please.

01:17:57.106 --> 01:18:02.209
Go.
Let's go.

01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:05.179
- Wait.

01:18:09.452 --> 01:18:11.152
Are we sure he's dead?

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:13.788
- Yeah.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:14.555
He looks dead.

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:15.823
- He's dead.

01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:17.658
- But are we 100 percent sure?

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:20.895
We've said it a thousand times.

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:23.531
In our line of work,
we have to be sure.

01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:26.500
- Blair, what are you saying?

01:18:28.004 --> 01:18:30.124
- I think we have to
stab him in the heart.

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:33.040
Or, cut off his head, or...

01:18:35.078 --> 01:18:42.316
Crush the skull.

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:55.830
- Okay.

01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:05.873
Ah...

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:23.958
Blair, I'm like 99
percent sure he's dead.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.593
- Just get it over with.

01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:26.761
Just...

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:34.268
Whack his head as
hard as you can.

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:39.807
- Get a good grip.

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:54.922
- Shit.

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:56.290
Blair, you scared
the shit out of me.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:57.291
- Ollie!

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:59.059
- Oh fuck.

01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:01.295
- Crush the skull!

01:20:18.381 --> 01:20:20.815
- See, it's okay.

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:22.850
Everything's gonna be just fine.

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.520
What's your name?

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:28.589
- Macy.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.560
- No it's not.

01:20:32.562 --> 01:20:34.161
It's Vivian.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:39.567
Your name is Vivian Dorp.
