26:05.355 --> 26:08.233
All the new age remedies out there,

26:08.316 --> 26:12.737
but nothing beats a schvitz
when it comes to stress.

26:14.030 --> 26:16.866
My job can be stressful, sure.

26:16.950 --> 26:22.414
But I can't imagine what it must be like
for you boys.

26:22.497 --> 26:23.873
Do we know you?

26:24.374 --> 26:25.208
No.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.586
But I know all about you.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.466
However,

26:34.134 --> 26:38.305
seems you've run into some problems

26:38.388 --> 26:41.141
on this job.

26:41.725 --> 26:42.601
Just a snag.

26:42.684 --> 26:46.938
You lost your brother.
I'd call that more than a snag.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.486
What if I can give you the location

26:53.570 --> 26:57.782
of the knife-hurling dolt responsible
for blowing up

26:57.866 --> 26:59.451
your beloved brother?

26:59.951 --> 27:00.994
Who are you?

27:01.077 --> 27:03.788
Somebody you're going to want to know.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.207
Unharm my wiener.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.256
Go on.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.884
I'll give you the exact location

27:15.967 --> 27:19.387
of the one you're looking for, Diego.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.555
The rest...

27:21.640 --> 27:23.308
I leave up to your imaginations.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.853
What's in it for you?

27:27.145 --> 27:28.563
Let's just say that

27:28.647 --> 27:33.735
his little game of "Hide the Sausage"
with my daughter

27:33.818 --> 27:36.279
needs a swift end.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.115
I just have one request.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.742
Don't hurt the little one with

27:41.368 --> 27:44.871
the cute socks.

27:48.792 --> 27:49.959
Lavender.
