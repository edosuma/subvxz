Thank you.

00:51.533 --> 00:53.362
God, what a day.

00:53.566 --> 00:54.759
ER.

00:55.199 --> 00:57.324
Yes, l know they're late,
but l can't--

00:57.633 --> 01:00.599
Okay, l'm on my way.
They're on their way up.

01:26.899 --> 01:30.729
No, this isn't ER.
This is Patrick.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.526
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:43.099 --> 01:44.826
Are you the new desk clerk?

01:45.966 --> 01:47.454
Yeah. Right.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.797
-Who are you?
-Patrick.

01:49.999 --> 01:52.056
Okay, Patrick, where is everybody?

01:54.265 --> 01:57.720
My dad went to the bathroom.

01:58.365 --> 02:00.763
You go sit over here.
You can't sit here.

02:04.998 --> 02:06.123
Don't turn.

02:10.365 --> 02:11.558
Hi, this is John Carter.

02:11.766 --> 02:14.197
l'm calling about your ad
for the apartment.

02:14.399 --> 02:15.797
Got anything to eat?

02:17.165 --> 02:18.153
l'm sorry?

02:18.365 --> 02:20.830
-Perfect. l'm starved.
-lt's been taken.

02:21.032 --> 02:22.362
Mr. Carter?

02:22.565 --> 02:24.588
This is great.
Where'd these come from?

02:24.798 --> 02:28.162
Taglieri. He brought them in
for Carol Hathaway, l think.

02:33.898 --> 02:36.262
There's a woman who needs
stitches in her face.

02:36.465 --> 02:39.692
The plastic surgery boys are there.
Go in and back cleanup.

02:39.898 --> 02:42.659
Give her a really good scar.
Just kidding.

02:42.865 --> 02:46.025
EMT's at the back door with
a 20-year-old stabbing victim.

02:46.232 --> 02:49.221
-lt doesn't sound good.
-All right. Notify the O.R.

02:49.431 --> 02:51.829
Tell the blood bank
l need eight units O-neg.

02:52.032 --> 02:53.520
You still doing
the total gastrectomy?

02:53.731 --> 02:55.720
l have an interview
with Morgenstern and Bradley.

02:55.931 --> 02:57.760
-Starzl Fellowship?
-Yep.

02:57.931 --> 02:58.919
-What?
-Nothing.

02:59.132 --> 03:00.961
Langworthy said only
third-year residents get it?

03:01.165 --> 03:02.323
-Exactly.
-ln her dreams.

03:02.531 --> 03:04.463
Tell Morgenstern to meet me
at Trauma 2.

03:04.665 --> 03:06.654
-What do we got?
-Stab wounds to the neck.

03:06.865 --> 03:10.093
-Pulse is 1 50 and thready, BP's 50 palp.
-What else?

03:10.298 --> 03:14.560
Couldn't tube him, too much blood.
This guy's circling the drain.

03:14.765 --> 03:17.027
l love that about you.
You're all optimism.

03:17.231 --> 03:20.129
All right, let's take the turn.
Get him in Trauma 2.

03:20.331 --> 03:24.161
Move it. Let's not lose him, all right?
Here we go. Follow me.

03:31.398 --> 03:33.227
All right, unstrap him.

03:35.930 --> 03:38.192
We're gonna do this
like we always do.

03:39.797 --> 03:43.628
We're gonna do it on my count.
One, two, three.

03:44.131 --> 03:46.256
Let's go to work.
Pulse ox?

03:46.697 --> 03:48.856
lt's only 70, and he's cyanotic.

03:49.064 --> 03:51.087
All right, let's go.
Here we go.

03:54.131 --> 03:56.653
No airway. lntubation tray.
Move!

03:57.331 --> 03:59.422
-Seven and a half?
-Yes.

04:06.164 --> 04:07.789
Come on. Come on.

04:08.231 --> 04:10.696
l can't see anything in here.
Suction!

04:10.964 --> 04:13.896
Come on. l need some suction.
Let's get it in here.

04:14.097 --> 04:16.494
All right, we got a
full out gusher here.

04:16.697 --> 04:19.891
One more minute, he'll have
brain damage. Let's do a crike.

04:20.096 --> 04:22.029
-You sure?
-As the day is long. Let's move.

04:22.230 --> 04:23.890
Doing a surgical airway here.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.221
Give me the numbers.
Count it out nice and loud.

04:27.430 --> 04:31.022
BP still 60 over 40, pulse 1 60.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.560
All right. Trach tube.

04:32.764 --> 04:33.889
Thank you, doctor.

04:34.897 --> 04:37.124
Syringe. Come on.

04:45.929 --> 04:48.020
Let's see what we got here.

04:54.664 --> 04:56.027
l like the way it sounds.

04:56.230 --> 04:59.685
All right, l believe we
have ourselves a breather here.

04:59.896 --> 05:02.294
Welcome back, sir.
Can you ventilate him?

05:02.497 --> 05:04.724
-Good morning, Peter.
-Breathing easy.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.122
What've you got?

05:06.397 --> 05:08.260
A stab wound to the neck.

05:08.463 --> 05:12.327
Unable to intubate due to bleeding.
l performed a stat cricothyrotomy.

05:12.530 --> 05:16.462
Airway established. Good bilateral
breath sounds. The patient is stable.

05:16.663 --> 05:19.561
What do you need me for?
Let's get him up to the O.R.

05:23.063 --> 05:24.393
Excellent.

05:24.596 --> 05:28.029
Excellent work.
Sound judgment. A solid execution.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.287
Excellent.

05:29.929 --> 05:32.690
l'll see you at the Starzl interview
this afternoon.

05:32.896 --> 05:34.192
Right.

05:36.263 --> 05:37.592
Pretty cool.

06:32.695 --> 06:33.683
ER.

06:34.329 --> 06:35.624
Yeah, hold on.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.791
Carter, phone for you.

06:39.662 --> 06:40.719
For me?

06:46.195 --> 06:47.354
Thanks, Jerry.

06:49.062 --> 06:51.960
Yes, l did call about the one bedroom.

06:53.795 --> 06:56.261
No. What about the studio?

06:56.995 --> 06:58.460
Garage?

06:58.695 --> 07:01.559
No, l don't think l want a gara--
Hello?

07:04.862 --> 07:06.623
-That's good.
-Looking for an apartment?

07:06.828 --> 07:11.089
Yeah. l've been living at home,
and my dad thinks l'm a freeloader.

07:11.295 --> 07:14.284
Mine did too.
l found my own place six months ago.

07:14.495 --> 07:17.484
-Through the paper?
-No, through a patient.

07:17.695 --> 07:20.252
Eighty-five-year-old guy
has a heart attack.

07:20.461 --> 07:22.450
He crumped, l jumped.

07:22.662 --> 07:25.651
-Are you saying that he died and--
-Dr. Benton?

07:26.361 --> 07:29.918
Dr. Morgenstern called. He wanted me
to tell you that your...

07:30.094 --> 07:32.117
-...Stertzle...?
-Starzl.

07:32.528 --> 07:34.925
The interview's been pushed to 3:00.

07:36.028 --> 07:37.619
Oh, man.

07:38.028 --> 07:39.994
A boy with a laceration in 1 .

07:40.361 --> 07:42.758
Carter's having a light day.
Let him take it.

07:43.561 --> 07:44.958
l'd rather you do it.

07:51.927 --> 07:54.485
Carter, see the kid in 1 .

07:54.694 --> 07:57.058
l gotta go to Recovery
to see a patient.

07:58.961 --> 08:01.393
A 96-year-old stroke victim
in Curtain Area 3.

08:01.594 --> 08:03.822
-You might want to check it out.
-Check it out?

08:04.128 --> 08:07.322
Yeah. He lives at
1 680 North Lakeshore Drive.

08:07.527 --> 08:09.356
Great location.

08:14.727 --> 08:15.886
More sleep.

08:16.994 --> 08:18.721
More sleep.

08:19.061 --> 08:20.390
Say it ain't so, Joe.

08:20.594 --> 08:22.423
lt ain't so, Joe.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.252
Oh, God. lt's 7:00.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.324
My shift starts in a half an hour.

08:27.961 --> 08:29.586
You're gonna be late.

08:29.794 --> 08:31.191
l am?

08:32.827 --> 08:35.292
l called the hospital
and told them...

08:35.494 --> 08:38.289
...you're too busy
having sex with your wife.

08:39.794 --> 08:42.624
And you want me to make
an honest woman out of you?

08:47.860 --> 08:50.349
Okay, that takes care of the cut.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.321
l fell off a ladder.

08:52.527 --> 08:53.754
Yeah, l know.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.858
Let's check your elbow.

08:56.294 --> 08:58.317
l fell off a stool...

08:58.527 --> 09:01.856
...but l didn't hurt my head.

09:02.060 --> 09:04.117
lt stays on, see?

09:04.627 --> 09:05.956
Go like this.

09:09.260 --> 09:11.283
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

09:11.693 --> 09:13.784
-Patrick.
-Patrick who?

09:15.394 --> 09:17.121
Me, Patrick.

09:18.593 --> 09:22.253
Okay. l think it's probably fine,
but just to be sure...

09:22.459 --> 09:24.323
...l'll have someone
take an x-ray.

09:25.027 --> 09:26.050
X-ray?

09:27.160 --> 09:29.717
lt's like a picture of your bones.

09:32.459 --> 09:33.652
Can l keep it?

09:33.860 --> 09:35.053
Sure.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.755
Thank you.

09:40.359 --> 09:41.916
You're welcome, Patrick.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.419
l'll be back to check on you, okay?

09:46.626 --> 09:48.353
Take him up to X-ray.

09:50.593 --> 09:51.616
Sweet kid.

09:51.826 --> 09:55.519
l think l should be going out
with patients instead of doctors.

09:55.726 --> 09:58.886
Doctors? l don't know.
Shrinks aren't too bad.

09:59.092 --> 10:01.149
-So the rumors are true.
-What rumors?

10:01.359 --> 10:03.257
That you've been dating Div Cvetic.

10:03.459 --> 10:05.254
Oh, just now and then.

10:05.459 --> 10:07.357
-For two months.
-Oh, jeez.

10:07.559 --> 10:09.956
Was it a secret?
You eat with him every day.

10:10.159 --> 10:13.125
Malik, did you get blood samples
from the lady in 5?

10:13.326 --> 10:15.883
-Already at the lab.
-Great. Thanks.

10:16.792 --> 10:17.917
So everyone knows?

10:18.126 --> 10:22.422
He's taking you to a birthday dinner
and asked you to wear that black dress.

10:22.659 --> 10:25.125
Oh, my God! Did he put it
in the newsletter?

10:25.326 --> 10:26.757
The bulletin board.

10:27.859 --> 10:29.291
Just kidding.

10:30.226 --> 10:31.249
l will...

10:31.459 --> 10:32.924
...kill him...

10:33.792 --> 10:35.418
...after dinner.

10:35.925 --> 10:37.414
Jerry, you got anything to eat?

10:37.625 --> 10:39.591
Bagels in the lounge.

10:39.992 --> 10:42.583
Never mind.
Did Linda Farrell come by yet?

10:43.059 --> 10:46.889
Linda Farrell of the pizza,
Armani suit, Novell Pharmaceuticals?

10:47.092 --> 10:49.887
-Yes, Jerry.
-Haven't seen her.

10:55.792 --> 10:57.655
l'm a little confused.

10:57.859 --> 11:00.654
ls Slice your first name
or your middle name?

11:01.625 --> 11:03.181
Slice is his street name.

11:03.392 --> 11:04.619
Right.

11:04.825 --> 11:08.382
Street name.
And how did this happen?

11:08.592 --> 11:10.114
Cops beat me up.

11:10.325 --> 11:13.155
He put his foot through a window
breaking and entering.

11:13.358 --> 11:15.790
Who's the nurse
on the phone out there?

11:15.991 --> 11:18.685
That's Nurse Wright. Lydia Wright.

11:18.892 --> 11:20.289
She married?

11:20.492 --> 11:22.082
l have no idea.

11:22.792 --> 11:25.314
This is probably gonna sting
a little bit.

11:25.592 --> 11:26.615
What's that?

11:26.824 --> 11:31.314
That's an EKG caliper. We use it
to measure distances on a cardiogram.

11:32.824 --> 11:36.813
A cardiogram measures
the electrical activity of the heart.

11:37.025 --> 11:39.491
You probably shouldn't be doing that.

11:48.058 --> 11:50.990
Grab Lydia and Jerry,
and meet me at the ambulance bay.

11:51.158 --> 11:52.146
You bet.

12:07.091 --> 12:10.057
Radial head looks okay.
No fat-pad sign.

12:10.258 --> 12:11.587
l think he's in the clear.

12:11.791 --> 12:14.689
EMT's pulling in right now.
Motorcycle versus semi.

12:14.891 --> 12:17.186
-Who's on?
-Benton and Ross.

12:23.791 --> 12:25.654
Surprise!

12:26.257 --> 12:29.815
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:30.024 --> 12:33.149
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:33.990 --> 12:38.855
<i>Happy birthday, dear Susan</i>

12:39.957 --> 12:44.481
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:46.823 --> 12:49.312
Birthday Jell-O in the lounge.

12:50.257 --> 12:52.916
-l hate this.
-That's why we did it. That's for you.

12:53.124 --> 12:55.386
-Happy birthday.
-Oh, thank you.

12:55.591 --> 12:56.988
Hey, Carol.

13:01.424 --> 13:04.254
l thought we'd crawl in here
and escape for an hour.

13:04.457 --> 13:08.287
You did? What if they find us in
a compromising position? Then what?

13:08.491 --> 13:10.854
Then how about a more exotic locale?

13:12.190 --> 13:13.712
l have seven minutes.

13:13.923 --> 13:14.946
Come on.

13:17.790 --> 13:21.120
l don't know if ''exotic'' is the word
l would've picked.

13:22.523 --> 13:23.511
Well, l mean....

13:23.723 --> 13:28.348
We'll put the pool in over there,
maybe a little wet bar, a putting green.

13:28.556 --> 13:31.249
-A putting green?
-Hey, l'm a doctor.

13:31.456 --> 13:34.513
Golf's easy. l could teach you
how to play this afternoon.

13:34.723 --> 13:36.211
l have four minutes.

13:36.590 --> 13:38.852
Maybe there's not
enough time for that.

13:39.857 --> 13:42.322
lf you moved in,
there'd be more than enough time.

13:42.523 --> 13:44.785
You mentioned something
about that, right?

13:44.990 --> 13:46.888
Yeah, two weeks ago.

13:47.523 --> 13:49.921
The silence of no answer
is getting deafening.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.313
Oh, God, Tag.

13:52.556 --> 13:54.818
So much has happened, you know?

13:55.223 --> 13:56.883
And we've gotten through that.

13:57.657 --> 14:00.714
l just--
l want to move slowly and feel sure.

14:00.922 --> 14:02.149
About us?

14:03.023 --> 14:04.580
About me.

14:05.356 --> 14:08.618
l think we have moved slowly,
and l am sure about it all.

14:10.189 --> 14:12.212
Look, l'm a good guy, Carol.

14:12.423 --> 14:14.048
And l love you.

14:15.123 --> 14:18.782
lf you have a problem with us,
l need you to deal with it.

14:42.555 --> 14:43.782
Knock, knock.

14:43.989 --> 14:45.216
Was that Patrick?

14:45.422 --> 14:48.082
Yeah. As a precaution,
Dr. Lewis has asked him...

14:48.289 --> 14:51.154
...to sit in a wheelchair
until his father gets here.

14:52.322 --> 14:54.118
Some precaution.

14:55.722 --> 14:58.313
Linda Farrell.
Still haven't seen her.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.147
Jerry, do you like your job?

15:01.355 --> 15:05.015
However, when l do, l'll track you down
no matter where you are.

15:05.222 --> 15:08.518
Well, and a good late morning to you.

15:10.489 --> 15:11.853
l had car trouble.

15:12.522 --> 15:14.215
l did. l had car trouble.

15:14.422 --> 15:15.854
How is Jennifer, Mark?

15:16.622 --> 15:17.747
She's great.

15:17.955 --> 15:20.717
Yeah, l'll bet. What's this for?
Later on tonight?

15:22.855 --> 15:24.151
Keep it up.

15:27.289 --> 15:29.754
She's adorable.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.245
She's almost 1 3 now.

15:32.622 --> 15:35.213
And this is Ralph.

15:35.422 --> 15:37.547
Have you ever seen anything so cute?

15:37.755 --> 15:39.687
Miniature schnauzers.

15:40.088 --> 15:41.384
Very cute.

15:43.122 --> 15:44.349
ls Mookie down there?

15:44.554 --> 15:45.918
Carter's stitching him up.

15:46.122 --> 15:47.747
Carter? Where's Benton?

15:47.955 --> 15:49.046
Don't know.

15:50.022 --> 15:52.852
That is one sorry paint job.

15:54.921 --> 15:58.251
The hospital saves the big bucks
for the doctors' salaries.

15:59.821 --> 16:02.719
l'm not even talking about myself.
l'm not a resident...

16:02.921 --> 16:05.114
...so they don't pay me anything.

16:05.688 --> 16:07.586
You're telling me you're a freebie?

16:10.955 --> 16:13.944
Where's Dr. Benton?
He's supposed to be stitching him up.

16:14.155 --> 16:16.087
Pawned me off on a freebie?

16:16.288 --> 16:20.243
Not one word out of you, Mookie James.
You've done enough for one day.

16:20.454 --> 16:22.249
-How do you two--
-Where is Benton?

16:22.454 --> 16:24.579
He had to go up to Recovery.

16:25.821 --> 16:27.878
Son of a bitch!

16:29.221 --> 16:32.051
You casually mentioned our dinner?

16:32.254 --> 16:33.481
To Doug Ross?

16:33.688 --> 16:36.279
Yeah. What's the problem?

16:36.488 --> 16:39.579
He's like Dr. lntercom.

16:39.788 --> 16:42.083
Biggest gossip in the hospital.

16:42.288 --> 16:45.015
The cafeteria workers probably know.

16:45.321 --> 16:48.775
But you do look great
in that black dress.

16:50.354 --> 16:52.081
This isn't working.

16:52.754 --> 16:53.777
Dr. Cvetic?

16:53.987 --> 16:55.919
-What?
-The patient l mentioned is over here--

16:56.121 --> 16:57.451
Three times you mentioned him.

16:57.654 --> 17:00.586
Three times l told you
l didn't have time to see him.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.011
What was your name?

17:03.221 --> 17:05.584
Div.
Malik, why don't l just take--

17:05.787 --> 17:07.513
Malik! That's right.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.584
And l told you that
three times too, Div.

17:11.021 --> 17:13.919
-Listen, son. You better--
-Okay, enough. Stop.

17:14.186 --> 17:17.210
-What will you do now? Arm wrestle?
-No, of course not.

17:17.420 --> 17:21.318
Look, l've had five admissions today.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.748
Two attempted suicides, two bipolars
who forgot to take lithium...

17:24.954 --> 17:28.909
...and a 40-year-old from the street
claiming to be dead, all before lunch.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.886
Your patient will have to
wait for the afternoon shift.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.313
Boat collision.
1 2-year-old in the wreck.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.713
-How long?
-EMT's pulling up now.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.181
Connie, clear Trauma 1 ,
notify the O.R. now, please.

17:53.387 --> 17:55.046
His parents are with him.

17:55.620 --> 17:58.586
-Are they hurt?
-Thrown free, but they came with him.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.082
Give me O.R.

18:00.287 --> 18:04.014
-Oscar, what do you got?
-David Adler, 1 2, found unconscious.

18:04.220 --> 18:06.981
-Please help him.
-Mr. and Mrs. Adler, l'm Dr. Ross.

18:07.186 --> 18:11.312
-We're taking your son to Trauma.
-He went under. We couldn't find him.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.110
BP 70, pulse 1 40.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.979
Jerry will tell you where to wait.

18:15.186 --> 18:17.981
-Can we stay with him?
-We'll do everything we can.

18:18.186 --> 18:20.482
-Couldn't start an lV or intubate.
-Come with me.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.517
Okay. All right, here we go.
Get that.

18:26.719 --> 18:30.913
On three. Hit that buckle.
On three. One, two, three.

18:33.053 --> 18:34.212
All right.

18:37.686 --> 18:39.777
-Pass me the lidocaine.
-Airway.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.576
-Here you are.
-You got it.

18:47.853 --> 18:50.149
-All right, give me a--
-Six and a half.

18:53.753 --> 18:56.275
All right. Come on.

19:10.019 --> 19:13.008
Heart rate's low. Let's give him
atropine and epinephrine.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.208
-O-negative's here.
-You ordered it?

19:17.052 --> 19:18.040
lnternal jugular?

19:18.586 --> 19:20.643
Have to.
His peripheral vein's collapsed.

19:20.818 --> 19:21.806
Here we go.

19:32.319 --> 19:34.716
Connie, will you move them
out of the hall?

19:40.185 --> 19:41.208
Perfect.

20:00.119 --> 20:01.709
Okay, here we go.

20:07.318 --> 20:08.807
Here it comes.

20:13.685 --> 20:15.083
l think we got this baby.

20:15.285 --> 20:17.013
O.R.'s prepped.
Benton will take him.

20:17.218 --> 20:20.616
-They can x-ray his C-spine upstairs.
-Let's take him on up.

20:22.818 --> 20:25.249
-Paddles!
-Two hundred?

20:27.318 --> 20:28.682
And clear.

20:30.551 --> 20:32.176
-Again.
-Three hundred?

20:32.518 --> 20:33.643
Clear.

20:34.752 --> 20:36.842
-Give me 360.
-Charging.

20:37.051 --> 20:38.381
And clear.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.875
Okay, he's stabilized.
Let's go!

21:01.051 --> 21:03.881
-Let's go! Come on.
-You'll need at least six units.

21:04.084 --> 21:05.811
All right, we got him. Let's go.

21:09.484 --> 21:11.780
-We just pulled that one out.
-Yes, we did.

21:11.984 --> 21:14.472
-That was like clockwork.
-l wish they all were.

21:14.684 --> 21:16.616
We haven't done a save like that
in a while.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.908
So smooth!

21:18.118 --> 21:21.413
You were great.
You anticipated every move, every beat.

21:21.617 --> 21:23.606
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yes, l mean it.

21:23.817 --> 21:27.079
l do. Yeah. l do.

21:30.350 --> 21:31.577
l do.

21:50.651 --> 21:53.116
l'm sorry.
l shouldn't have done that.

21:56.484 --> 21:58.143
You didn't do it alone.

22:13.150 --> 22:15.116
Listen, l gotta go.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.978
All right, Patrick.
You'll be all right.

22:25.284 --> 22:26.409
Going home, Patrick?

22:27.950 --> 22:29.177
His father's here.

22:29.383 --> 22:32.543
And you're going to take it easy
for the next few days.

22:34.217 --> 22:37.206
Pick a card, any card.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.813
Oh, pick a card, any card.

22:45.983 --> 22:46.971
Here.

22:47.549 --> 22:49.674
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

22:49.883 --> 22:51.712
Let's find your dad.

22:52.050 --> 22:53.640
Let's go, Patrick.

22:54.017 --> 22:55.482
-All right.
-Going home.

22:56.716 --> 22:58.079
Going home?

22:58.283 --> 22:59.579
Where am l going?

22:59.850 --> 23:02.111
Can l come back and visit?

23:16.882 --> 23:21.281
Doug, l got a three-year-old with
a fever in 2, a six-month-old in 4.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.313
His mother says he's not
keeping anything down.

23:24.549 --> 23:26.344
Okay, l'll be right there.

23:26.682 --> 23:28.773
l'm sorry,
l still haven't seen her.

23:28.982 --> 23:31.540
-Seen who?
-Linda Farrell.

23:32.649 --> 23:35.172
Oh, right, Jerry.
Okay, thank you.

23:43.949 --> 23:47.938
Michael Carson, age 35, victim of
a five-mile-an-hour car accident.

23:48.149 --> 23:50.240
Not a scratch.
No clue why he's comatose.

23:50.448 --> 23:51.436
Results of the CT?

23:51.649 --> 23:54.809
Normal. No improvement
with glucose and narcan.

23:55.749 --> 23:58.045
Well, he's non-surgical.

23:58.582 --> 24:02.981
-He's all yours.
-The differential diagnosis of coma, huh?

24:03.215 --> 24:06.046
-Good luck.
-You too, on your interview.

24:10.415 --> 24:13.643
Well, let's see what
we can come up with.

24:16.548 --> 24:18.979
l asked you to take that boy
with the laceration.

24:19.181 --> 24:21.511
-Haleh, what are you doing here?
-Why didn't you?

24:21.715 --> 24:23.578
Carter could handle it.
What's the problem?

24:23.782 --> 24:26.339
The problem is
l asked you to treat him...

24:26.548 --> 24:28.639
...and hoped maybe you'd talk to him.

24:28.849 --> 24:31.973
-l had a patient to see in Recovery.
-The hell you did.

24:32.181 --> 24:34.477
You just didn't want to be involved.

24:34.715 --> 24:36.738
Okay. Whoa, wait a minute.

24:37.448 --> 24:39.641
Am l supposed to be
the Big Brothers program?

24:39.848 --> 24:43.678
l'm supposed to turn every gang kid
in here into Nelson Mandela?

24:43.881 --> 24:45.938
l know you'd never do that, Peter.

24:46.148 --> 24:48.171
That's why l never asked you before.

24:49.582 --> 24:52.672
l've known Mookie
since he was four years old...

24:52.881 --> 24:55.779
...and he was a sweet kid.

24:55.981 --> 24:58.140
And maybe someone
will get through to him...

24:58.348 --> 25:00.870
...and he will be that again someday.

25:01.447 --> 25:05.210
Probably wouldn't be half as tough
as getting through to you.

25:12.081 --> 25:16.173
What about metabolic causes?
Hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis?

25:16.381 --> 25:20.279
Blood tests rule that out. We know
it can't be arrhythmia or an Ml.

25:20.481 --> 25:23.538
Negative CT rules out mass lesion
and trauma. Benton gave him narcan?

25:23.748 --> 25:25.078
And an amp of D-50.

25:25.281 --> 25:27.770
The blood was normal except
for the elevated white count.

25:27.981 --> 25:29.640
Up to 1 4,500.

25:29.848 --> 25:33.780
Pulse is slowing. lt's down to 50.
And his BP's dropping.

25:33.981 --> 25:38.709
Well, speed up the lVs and give him
300cc bolus of saline.

25:38.914 --> 25:40.379
What about atropine?

25:40.581 --> 25:43.513
Yeah. Point 5 lV push.

25:43.881 --> 25:46.312
Maybe he had a seizure.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.779
Connie, get a temperature.

25:51.681 --> 25:55.408
He's got a slight abrasion on
his tongue, probably from biting it.

25:56.447 --> 25:58.208
Partially compensated
metabolic acidosis.

25:58.414 --> 25:59.845
You see that with seizures.

26:00.180 --> 26:02.043
1 01 .5.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.146
Meningitis?

26:04.847 --> 26:06.404
Yeah, could be.

26:06.613 --> 26:09.273
We'll have to do a lumbar puncture.
You ever done one?

26:09.481 --> 26:11.878
No, no. But l've seen it done.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.069
See one, do one, teach one.

26:37.014 --> 26:38.912
-Benton.
-Hey, Sarah.

26:39.114 --> 26:40.579
You changed clothes.

26:42.713 --> 26:43.838
Yeah.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.704
-Who's in there now?
-Dalton.

26:47.913 --> 26:49.401
George Dalton?

26:49.813 --> 26:53.142
The guy can't close a door,
much less an incision.

26:53.380 --> 26:54.710
Yeah, who are you telling?

26:54.913 --> 26:58.140
l once saw him try to connect
a ureter to a sigmoid colon.

26:58.346 --> 26:59.369
You think that's bad?

26:59.580 --> 27:03.978
l watched him do a beautiful right
fem-pop bypass on a femoral artery.

27:04.179 --> 27:06.611
The left femoral artery.

27:08.213 --> 27:09.838
What'd he say to the patient?

27:10.046 --> 27:13.274
''There's some good news and, well,
there's some bad news.''

27:13.480 --> 27:16.344
''Well, sir, the operation
was a success.''

27:16.546 --> 27:18.943
''But it was the wrong leg.''

27:25.746 --> 27:28.144
That was terrific.
Thank you, Dr. Dalton.

27:28.779 --> 27:30.904
lt was good. lt really was.
Thanks a lot.

27:31.113 --> 27:34.806
Dr. Benton, you don't mind if we take
Dr. Langworthy first, do you?

27:35.013 --> 27:37.535
She's scrubbing on
a small bowel at 4:30.

27:37.746 --> 27:39.575
Oh, no. Not at all.

27:39.779 --> 27:41.745
-Sarah, you ready?
-Yeah, sure.

27:41.946 --> 27:43.242
Come on in.

27:44.679 --> 27:48.271
lnsert it between L-4 and L-5.

27:53.179 --> 27:56.736
Tilt it slightly upwards
so it's parallel with the bed.

27:59.212 --> 28:02.906
Advance it slowly between
the vertebrae...

28:03.113 --> 28:05.101
...then you'll feel a slight pop...

28:05.312 --> 28:08.710
...when the tip punctures
the spinal canal.

28:12.846 --> 28:15.471
-l felt it.
-Okay, you're not done yet.

28:15.712 --> 28:18.576
Now remove the stylet
from the needle...

28:18.779 --> 28:20.608
...and check for fluid.

28:26.345 --> 28:28.709
Perfect. Bingo.

28:29.012 --> 28:31.171
Perfect on the first shot.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.940
Crystal clear, Mr. Carter.

28:34.145 --> 28:36.043
That's one hell of a champagne tap.

28:36.245 --> 28:37.575
Champagne tap?

28:37.778 --> 28:40.710
Perfect hit the first time,
resident owes you a bottle.

28:40.911 --> 28:43.638
No, no, not the resident, the nurse.

28:43.911 --> 28:47.241
Dr. Greene, your wife asked if
you could meet her at Doc's.

28:47.445 --> 28:49.035
Okay. Thanks, Jerry.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.305
Couldn't wait till tonight?

29:16.511 --> 29:17.738
l wish.

29:19.745 --> 29:23.177
Judge Franklin called.
He said my zoning opinion...

29:23.378 --> 29:27.276
...wasn't what he'd hoped for
from a University of Chicago graduate.

29:27.478 --> 29:29.842
-The guy's nuts.
-He's an appellate judge.

29:30.111 --> 29:34.373
So what? lt's the first thing
you've written. What do you expect?

29:34.578 --> 29:35.805
Something better...

29:36.011 --> 29:39.205
...which he'll personally lead me in
at tonight's meeting.

29:43.778 --> 29:47.505
l called my mom. She's going to
bring Rachel up in the morning.

29:47.910 --> 29:50.069
l'll have to use the car again.

29:50.611 --> 29:52.974
lt's all right. l'll take the El.

29:57.111 --> 29:59.168
Jen, you'll do fine.

29:59.844 --> 30:01.003
How do you know?

30:01.211 --> 30:03.870
This is a ''make it or break it'' job.

30:04.077 --> 30:06.168
l mean, if l blow this chance....

30:11.211 --> 30:13.006
l wanted to spend the night with you.

30:14.844 --> 30:16.401
Well, you'll be back Monday.

30:17.810 --> 30:20.469
Rachel's daycare's
having a Halloween party Monday.

30:24.144 --> 30:26.735
-What about Tuesday?
-l work Tuesday.

30:28.277 --> 30:29.834
Well, maybe you can get off.

30:39.844 --> 30:43.708
We'll figure this all out.
lt's just gonna take a little time.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.769
l'll call you when l get up there.

31:12.477 --> 31:14.602
l'll see you tomorrow
on that hemicolectomy.

31:14.809 --> 31:18.435
You bet. Dr. Benton, thank you
so much for waiting. You ready?

31:18.643 --> 31:19.768
Good.

31:21.776 --> 31:26.175
This is Dr. Bradley. He's in charge of
the Starzl Fellowship this year.

31:26.377 --> 31:29.604
Yes. Please be seated, Dr. Benton.
Pleasure.

31:29.809 --> 31:30.968
Thank you.

31:33.542 --> 31:37.736
lt isn't often we entertain the
candidacy of a second-year resident.

31:38.210 --> 31:41.074
Yes, l know.
l feel very appreciative...

31:41.277 --> 31:44.209
...that you feel my qualifications
are worthy of consideration.

31:44.409 --> 31:45.841
Excellent recommendations.

31:46.043 --> 31:48.270
Obviously solid achievement.

31:48.643 --> 31:52.541
As you know, the Starzl Fellowship
allows you to study...

31:52.743 --> 31:55.834
...with transplant teams.
Have you researched that area?

31:56.043 --> 31:59.372
Well, not directly,
but l've done some--

31:59.609 --> 32:02.166
Any extracurricular activities?

32:02.376 --> 32:03.865
Yes.

32:04.442 --> 32:06.840
l believe it says-- Excuse me--
Right there.

32:07.809 --> 32:09.741
The AO A Honor Society.

32:10.042 --> 32:13.372
Right. Back in medical school.
Anything more recent?

32:15.709 --> 32:16.834
No.

32:17.075 --> 32:20.098
Peter has shown superior commitment,
leadership.

32:20.309 --> 32:23.002
His students come out
stronger than any l've seen.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.607
Well, that's very good.

32:24.808 --> 32:26.399
That's very good indeed.

32:26.808 --> 32:27.967
Thank you.

32:28.643 --> 32:32.836
Thank you for taking the time to
go through the qualifying process.

32:33.042 --> 32:35.906
We won't make a decision
for another two weeks...

32:36.109 --> 32:38.007
...but you'll hear from us then.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.034
Thank you.

32:45.509 --> 32:46.769
Thank you.

32:47.708 --> 32:48.867
Thank you.

32:53.942 --> 32:55.771
Thanks, Peter. You did great.

33:09.009 --> 33:12.066
Hey, Lydia. Will you give
this message to Carter for me?

33:12.275 --> 33:15.037
Sure. l didn't know he was
looking for an apartment.

33:15.241 --> 33:18.298
-There's two in my building.
-Yeah? That makes three.

33:18.508 --> 33:21.303
-Good night, ladies.
-Good night, Jerry.

33:41.708 --> 33:43.832
l hired Mookie today.

33:44.408 --> 33:46.203
That gang kid.

33:46.675 --> 33:49.402
CitiKids lntern Program.

33:49.807 --> 33:53.171
He does volunteer work,
they suspend his sentence...

33:53.375 --> 33:55.432
...and he stays out of juvenile hall.

33:56.874 --> 33:59.170
He starts next week.

34:00.974 --> 34:03.769
l put you down as his supervisor.

34:05.874 --> 34:08.136
-You don't mind?
-lt's been a long day.

34:08.341 --> 34:10.068
l could use a quiet night at home.

34:10.275 --> 34:13.400
The lecture's on advances
in cardiomyopathy.

34:13.607 --> 34:15.539
A room full of cardiologists.

34:15.741 --> 34:17.706
l could hit my quota in one night.

34:17.907 --> 34:20.429
Then it's an opportunity
that you shouldn't miss.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.300
l'll make it up to you this weekend.

34:22.507 --> 34:24.803
After last weekend, l believe you.

34:32.373 --> 34:33.567
What?

34:33.774 --> 34:35.603
Since when are you so eager
to be stood up?

34:35.873 --> 34:37.897
Even l need rest.

34:38.139 --> 34:42.232
This is the Murdock chart that
l've been looking for all afternoon.

34:42.774 --> 34:46.763
Call me crazy, but the black dress
looks better without the lab coat.

34:46.974 --> 34:50.667
Just shut up. l can barely
sit here dictating charts like this.

34:50.873 --> 34:51.998
You can in my book.

34:54.373 --> 34:56.465
Happy birthday, Susie-cakes.

34:56.674 --> 35:00.538
<i>Happy birthday to you
Everybody! Come on.</i>

35:00.741 --> 35:04.070
<i>Happy birthday
You live in a zoo</i>

35:04.274 --> 35:05.638
Hey, Billy, this is Susie.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.204
All right. Happy birthday.

35:08.073 --> 35:09.596
Hey! Hi to you too.

35:09.806 --> 35:11.272
This is my sister, Chloe.

35:12.940 --> 35:15.372
-Oh, and this is Billy.
-And, Billy.

35:15.773 --> 35:16.932
Hi, Billy.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.962
Now, we've come to celebrate.

35:20.173 --> 35:22.002
Oh, man. Chloe!

35:22.740 --> 35:26.570
l know this really cool club
where there's dancing. You'll love it.

35:26.773 --> 35:28.796
l'm gonna go take a look at these.

35:29.007 --> 35:30.030
Why don't you come?

35:30.606 --> 35:31.731
l gotta work.

35:31.940 --> 35:33.031
Come on!

35:37.706 --> 35:39.229
Congratulations.

35:39.439 --> 35:40.632
Good night.

35:48.206 --> 35:52.298
Jerry said to give this to you.
There's a couple in my building too.

35:55.606 --> 35:57.765
Wow. This is like the perfect day.

36:00.873 --> 36:03.498
What else are you guys on?
Vodka and what else?

36:03.706 --> 36:07.160
Nothing. l just wanted to
wish you a happy birthday.

36:07.373 --> 36:10.464
So you showed up drunk
with a guy you met an hour ago?

36:10.673 --> 36:12.730
Oh, l did not!

36:12.939 --> 36:15.565
Billy cares about me...

36:15.773 --> 36:17.863
...so just leave him out of it.

36:18.072 --> 36:19.970
l think he is already out of it.

36:20.172 --> 36:23.502
ls he staying at my place too?
Did he help you steal the TV?

36:23.706 --> 36:25.365
Oh, you shut up.

36:25.573 --> 36:26.902
You just shut up, Susie.

36:27.106 --> 36:31.004
You are just like Mom.
You're just like Dad.

36:31.206 --> 36:33.831
You just always hate
everything that l do.

36:34.239 --> 36:35.829
That is not true and you know it.

36:36.039 --> 36:38.971
Nothing was any different at home
for me than it was for you.

36:39.172 --> 36:41.434
-Sure!
-Oh, my God.

36:41.639 --> 36:44.128
l don't know why
l'm having this conversation.

36:44.339 --> 36:48.032
They never thought l could
do anything, you know?

36:48.239 --> 36:51.796
Do you think they thought
l could become a doctor?

36:52.006 --> 36:55.302
l had to prove it to them.
Sometimes l still have to, every day.

36:55.505 --> 36:58.960
You don't know anything
about every day!

36:59.672 --> 37:00.968
You don't know.

37:01.172 --> 37:03.797
You don't have to worry about
paying the rent.

37:04.006 --> 37:06.767
You don't have to worry about
where you'll sleep.

37:06.972 --> 37:10.995
You don't have to worry about
getting a job!

37:21.238 --> 37:22.568
Calm down.

37:23.639 --> 37:25.366
lt's gonna be okay.

37:26.772 --> 37:28.761
You're safe here, Chloe.

37:28.971 --> 37:30.528
Do you understand?

37:34.904 --> 37:37.598
Dr. Benton's going to fix your hand.

37:38.038 --> 37:42.698
And then, if you want, you and l
can talk through all this. Okay?

38:12.138 --> 38:13.364
You are pathetic.

38:14.038 --> 38:17.266
What are you doing back?
l thought Jennifer was in town.

38:17.571 --> 38:18.696
So did l.

38:18.904 --> 38:21.369
l thought you had a date
with the drug lady.

38:22.371 --> 38:25.428
She went to a lecture
on cardiomyopathy instead.

38:25.638 --> 38:26.831
Wow. That stings.

38:27.237 --> 38:28.828
Actually, l'm glad.

38:29.038 --> 38:31.196
She might be a little perky for me.

38:32.304 --> 38:33.998
Perky? l thought you liked perky.

38:34.204 --> 38:36.102
Well, this is true. But lately...

38:36.304 --> 38:40.794
...l've found myself attracted to
sullen and withdrawn and confused.

38:42.471 --> 38:45.198
-You ought to go out with me.
-l am out with you.

38:45.404 --> 38:47.097
Oh, my. Oh, my.

38:48.170 --> 38:50.534
Come on! l'm the short guy out here.

38:50.738 --> 38:54.261
There's nothing, you know,
wrong with a little infantile...

38:54.471 --> 38:57.767
...schoolyard competition
to kind of boost the spirits.

38:59.271 --> 39:02.260
Here we go. A little game
of one-on-one, to 21 .

39:02.471 --> 39:04.596
-A buck a point.
-You're on.

39:04.803 --> 39:06.064
All right, you ready?

39:09.170 --> 39:10.431
Through the legs.

39:15.471 --> 39:17.437
They're stitching her up now.

39:18.471 --> 39:20.561
She can sleep it off tonight
in Room 3...

39:20.770 --> 39:23.236
...and Benton will find somewhere
to throw Billy.

39:23.437 --> 39:25.698
He ought to find somewhere
to lock him up.

39:26.837 --> 39:28.360
Told you, l don't like surprises.

39:28.703 --> 39:31.533
-l'm sorry.
-lt's all right. l'm used to it.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.502
Come on, let me get you out of here.

39:34.703 --> 39:36.192
We can still grab some dinner.

39:37.336 --> 39:39.564
No, l don't really feel like it.

39:40.104 --> 39:42.002
l think l'll go up top,
grab some air.

39:42.204 --> 39:44.499
You want some company?

39:45.137 --> 39:46.762
Can l come over later?

39:49.603 --> 39:50.899
Maybe.

39:52.603 --> 39:55.433
l don't know, Div. l'll call you.

39:59.169 --> 40:00.692
So...

40:01.470 --> 40:03.629
...you and Doug were great today.

40:04.436 --> 40:05.459
What?

40:05.670 --> 40:07.727
The 1 2-year-old, boating accident.

40:07.936 --> 40:09.766
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

40:09.969 --> 40:12.458
Another 1 0 minutes,
we would've lost him.

40:13.370 --> 40:14.801
l'll see you later.

40:30.336 --> 40:32.097
Hey. Come on in.

40:34.336 --> 40:35.824
Word came down from the O.R.

40:36.036 --> 40:39.695
The kid from the boating accident
came through well. He'll be fine.

40:40.103 --> 40:41.796
That's great news.

40:43.535 --> 40:45.365
Pretty strange day, huh?

40:45.836 --> 40:47.359
You could say that.

40:47.702 --> 40:50.497
l could live the whole thing
all over again.

40:55.702 --> 40:57.691
Doug, John asked me
to move in with him.

40:57.902 --> 41:00.800
l thought l should tell you
that l told him l would.

41:05.836 --> 41:07.665
Did you decide this this afternoon?

41:07.869 --> 41:09.425
We talked about it for a while.

41:09.636 --> 41:13.159
-But did you decide to tell him today?
-lt doesn't matter.

41:13.369 --> 41:15.995
What happened with us this afternoon,
does that matter?

41:16.235 --> 41:18.394
What happened was an accident.

41:19.168 --> 41:21.134
There are no accidents.

41:26.235 --> 41:27.462
Look, it's great.

41:27.669 --> 41:30.601
Really, it's great.

41:34.235 --> 41:35.633
Thanks for letting me know.

42:20.168 --> 42:22.497
l can't find anybody
to drink this with me.

42:23.668 --> 42:26.066
l don't know that l'm
the best candidate.

42:26.268 --> 42:29.132
-You are the only one with a birthday.
-Oh, please.

42:29.334 --> 42:32.061
However, you're not the only one
with a crazy family.

42:34.601 --> 42:38.556
My dad says you should never, ever
do this with a bottle of champagne.

42:39.735 --> 42:41.701
Now, if that's not crazy....

42:44.234 --> 42:45.666
Are you ready?

42:45.868 --> 42:48.766
l don't think so, but okay.

42:53.900 --> 42:55.594
-Here.
-Thanks.

42:55.800 --> 42:59.732
You know, Carter, this is a whole side
of you l've never seen before.

43:00.568 --> 43:03.261
What do you mean?
l come up here a lot.

43:03.834 --> 43:05.130
You do?

43:05.334 --> 43:08.891
lf you were Dr. Benton's student,
you'd come up here a lot too.

43:09.867 --> 43:14.129
However, today was an excellent day.
l performed my first lumbar puncture.

43:14.334 --> 43:16.765
-How was it?
-Really scary.

43:17.001 --> 43:19.694
Dr. Greene talked me through it.
The patient did have meningitis.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.764
Now he'll be okay.
l guess that's worth a scare.

43:23.767 --> 43:26.233
You know, you can call us
by our first names.

43:26.433 --> 43:27.524
You call me Carter.

43:28.500 --> 43:30.693
Yeah, well, that's different...

43:31.300 --> 43:32.732
...somehow.

43:33.467 --> 43:37.161
So your sister, she's really stuck
on this guy with the greasy hair?

43:37.367 --> 43:39.595
l doubt she knows his last name.
Why?

43:39.800 --> 43:40.993
l was gonna ask her out.

43:42.734 --> 43:43.757
Who are you?

43:43.967 --> 43:45.125
l'm just kidding...

43:45.333 --> 43:46.731
...Susan.

43:47.067 --> 43:48.555
l get it...

43:48.767 --> 43:50.130
...John.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.666
No, it doesn't sound right.

43:54.500 --> 43:57.125
Okay. Call me Carter.
