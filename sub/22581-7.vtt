"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

00:55.388 --> 00:58.808
"It's been a long time"

00:59.017 --> 01:02.854
"But my time is finally near"

01:03.062 --> 01:07.317
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:07.525 --> 01:10.445
"I will touch the sky"

01:10.653 --> 01:14.449
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:14.657 --> 01:17.660
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:17.869 --> 01:22.582
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:22.790 --> 01:25.710
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:25.918 --> 01:30.506
"I've got faith to believe"

01:30.715 --> 01:33.301
"I can do anything"

01:33.509 --> 01:38.014
"I've got strength of the soul"

01:38.222 --> 01:41.100
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

01:41.309 --> 01:46.647
"I can reach any star"

01:47.023 --> 01:50.776
"I've got faith"

01:50.985 --> 01:54.697
"I've got faith"

01:54.906 --> 01:59.702
"Faith of the heart"

02:13.990 --> 02:16.451
Maybe it's just me, but it seems
like these Vulcan star charts

02:16.659 --> 02:18.328
take all the fun out of it.

02:18.536 --> 02:20.163
We're supposed to be
explorers, aren't we?

02:20.372 --> 02:21.581
That's the general idea.

02:21.790 --> 02:24.959
Where's the exploration in going
places people have already been?

02:25.168 --> 02:28.421
Well, for one thing,
we've never been to these places.

02:28.630 --> 02:30.173
For another...

02:30.548 --> 02:33.302
Remember that protostar
we ran across last week?

02:33.511 --> 02:36.639
- Yeah.
- I'm not seeing it here.

02:39.141 --> 02:41.393
Are you saying
those Vulcan star charts

02:41.602 --> 02:43.604
aren't all that accurate?

02:45.147 --> 02:48.609
Well, if that's true, good luck
getting them to admit it.

02:50.194 --> 02:51.445
Come in.

02:53.697 --> 02:54.865
You wanted to see me, captain.

02:55.074 --> 02:58.619
As a matter of fact, Mr Tucker and I
were looking at these star charts.

02:58.827 --> 03:01.997
There's a planet a few light years
off our current heading.

03:02.748 --> 03:03.958
I'm familiar with it.

03:04.167 --> 03:07.795
Well, the data indicates
there's a remote outpost right here,

03:08.004 --> 03:10.173
on the northern hemisphere.

03:10.798 --> 03:14.344
- P'Jem.
- I take it this P'Jem

03:14.552 --> 03:15.929
is under Vulcan jurisdiction?

03:16.137 --> 03:17.931
It's an ancient spiritual retreat,

03:18.139 --> 03:21.809
a remote sanctuary for Kolinahr
and peaceful meditation.

03:22.226 --> 03:25.605
- Kolinahr?
- The Vulcan purging of emotion.

03:26.898 --> 03:28.941
Well, that sounds interesting.

03:29.859 --> 03:31.527
How do you think they'd feel
about a visit?

03:31.986 --> 03:34.655
P'Jem is a place
of quiet contemplation, captain.

03:34.864 --> 03:36.741
I'm not certain we'd be welcome.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.620
It's because Vulcans think
we smell bad, isn't it?

03:41.747 --> 03:46.335
It's not every day we get a chance
to see an ancient Vulcan monastery.

03:46.543 --> 03:49.588
I'd say a stopover
is too good to pass up.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.048
Unless you disagree.

03:52.174 --> 03:54.218
I'll research the proper protocols.

03:54.426 --> 03:55.594
Good.

03:55.802 --> 03:58.221
- Archer to helm.
- Go ahead, sir.

03:58.430 --> 04:01.767
Prepare to lay in a course correction.
T'Pol will give you the coordinates.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.393
Understood.

04:10.485 --> 04:13.196
Well, you must be looking forward
to visiting the sanctuary.

04:13.529 --> 04:15.323
It was the captain's idea.

04:15.531 --> 04:18.659
But such an opportunity
to appreciate your cultural history.

04:19.035 --> 04:21.329
It is a Vulcan sanctuary,
if that's what you mean.

04:21.536 --> 04:24.624
Precisely my point. You'll be able
to introduce some of your own people

04:24.832 --> 04:26.292
to your new crew.

04:29.712 --> 04:31.672
I believe I see the source
of your misgivings:

04:31.881 --> 04:34.550
Being seen with a human crew.

04:34.967 --> 04:38.262
It could create a certain awkwardness.

04:44.269 --> 04:45.729
May I?

04:51.109 --> 04:56.323
I confess, I feel awkward myself
on this ship sometimes. Out of place.

04:56.531 --> 05:00.202
But what is that Vulcan motto?
Infinite diversity...

05:00.410 --> 05:02.370
In infinite combinations.

05:03.622 --> 05:09.252
And what is diversity
but a celebration of differences?

05:12.922 --> 05:16.427
I wonder if you might remind me
of our mission on this vessel.

05:16.844 --> 05:19.055
Please, indulge me.

05:19.847 --> 05:21.932
Our mission is to make contact
with those

05:22.141 --> 05:25.519
who humans consider
new life and new civilisations.

05:26.228 --> 05:28.689
In other words,
to seek infinite diversity.

05:29.482 --> 05:30.608
I suppose so.

05:30.816 --> 05:33.027
Well, then, it seems to me
a cultural exchange

05:33.235 --> 05:35.112
between your Vulcan brethren
and your human crew

05:35.321 --> 05:38.365
is simply a furtherance
of that mission.

05:54.841 --> 05:57.886
- They don't even know we're coming?
- It wasn't possible to hail them.

05:58.094 --> 06:00.388
The monks consider technology
a distraction

06:00.597 --> 06:02.015
from their spiritual pursuits.

06:02.223 --> 06:04.601
I don't like dropping in
on people unannounced.

06:04.809 --> 06:08.688
It won't be a problem as long
as we observe the proper protocols.

06:09.147 --> 06:12.525
When we arrive, we'll be greeted
by a Vulcan elder.

06:12.734 --> 06:14.652
You should not speak to him,

06:14.861 --> 06:17.614
or any member of the order,
unless spoken to first.

06:17.822 --> 06:19.532
If they appear to be meditating,

06:19.741 --> 06:23.078
do not approach them
or attempt to make conversation.

06:23.287 --> 06:26.999
Also, maintain quiet at all times,

06:27.207 --> 06:32.546
and do not touch or disturb
any artefacts, relics or ornamentation.

06:32.921 --> 06:35.758
If we arrive at their time
of communal Kolinahr,

06:35.966 --> 06:38.218
it's likely we'll be turned away.

06:38.427 --> 06:39.720
At the conclusion of our visit,

06:39.928 --> 06:43.557
we'll be offered the stone of J'Kah
as a gesture of salutation.

06:43.766 --> 06:45.142
Accept it.

06:45.350 --> 06:46.435
Then bow slightly...

06:46.643 --> 06:50.397
and observe a respectful silence
for approximately five seconds.

06:57.614 --> 07:00.158
I thought Starfleet training was tough.

07:09.125 --> 07:12.045
You say this is a place
to purge emotions?

07:12.545 --> 07:16.090
Looks like somebody had to purge
pretty bad. He bashed the door in.

07:16.632 --> 07:19.135
The temple is almost
3,000 years old, commander.

07:19.343 --> 07:22.472
You can't expect it
to be in pristine condition.

08:07.226 --> 08:09.937
We are honoured to visit
this great sanctuary.

08:10.146 --> 08:11.981
I cannot ask you to stay.

08:12.189 --> 08:15.651
We are observing
the final phase of Kolinahr.

08:21.699 --> 08:24.410
He says we have arrived
at the time of Kolinahr.

08:24.994 --> 08:28.497
The order must remain in silent
reflection throughout the lunar cycle.

08:28.706 --> 08:30.499
They are not to be disturbed.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.668
That's too bad.

08:33.210 --> 08:36.506
At least we got to see the place.

08:40.469 --> 08:42.386
Your service honours us.

08:42.761 --> 08:45.682
Before we leave, may I request
the offering of the J'Kah stone

08:45.891 --> 08:47.642
for my distinguished guests?

08:48.310 --> 08:49.978
Please wait.

09:02.198 --> 09:03.783
Something wrong?

09:04.993 --> 09:06.870
It's probably nothing.

09:07.078 --> 09:08.455
But?

09:09.957 --> 09:11.292
This is the main atrium.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.712
There should be more than
one member of the order present.

09:16.338 --> 09:20.509
And the icon in that shrine
is perched at an odd angle.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.720
Oddly perched, huh?

09:23.345 --> 09:25.222
We'd better call Starfleet Command.

09:26.015 --> 09:27.892
That's not all, captain.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.728
The Vulcan elder seems...

09:30.936 --> 09:32.479
...agitated.

09:32.688 --> 09:34.231
You call that agitated?

09:37.318 --> 09:42.657
You know, I think the oldest
monastery I ever visited was in...

09:43.063 --> 09:45.233
Ngari, Tibet.

09:45.368 --> 09:50.915
But it wasn't nearly as big
as this place.

09:51.583 --> 09:55.003
I've heard it can take days
to explore this site.

09:55.211 --> 09:57.881
It'd take at least that long
to clean the place up.

09:58.089 --> 09:59.382
Forgive the disarray.

09:59.591 --> 10:01.384
Kolinahr encourages members
of our order

10:01.593 --> 10:03.761
to face their vestigial emotions.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.848
The repercussions
can sometimes be violent.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.892
Please.

10:10.852 --> 10:12.603
This is the stone of J'Kah,

10:12.812 --> 10:15.232
which represents the foundation
of all we believe.

10:15.441 --> 10:18.485
A life of order and control
through logic.

10:31.248 --> 10:33.333
What's all that mean, anyway?

10:34.209 --> 10:37.045
It is a traditional litany,
passed down for generations.

10:37.379 --> 10:39.423
Does it mean I get good luck
or something?

10:39.673 --> 10:41.466
You're thinking
of the Blarney Stone, captain,

10:41.675 --> 10:43.218
or when you
pat the Buddha's belly.

10:49.851 --> 10:51.644
I guess you're right.

10:52.437 --> 10:54.272
Too bad we...

10:54.897 --> 10:57.442
...didn't bring a camera,
huh, commander?

10:58.234 --> 11:01.070
Please, you must leave now.

11:02.113 --> 11:04.323
You ever been
to the San Francisco Zoo?

11:04.532 --> 11:06.701
Now, there's something
you should see.

11:24.678 --> 11:26.555
Friends of yours?

11:31.852 --> 11:33.854
Somehow I didn't think so.

11:48.618 --> 11:49.953
Stop looking at me.

11:50.161 --> 11:53.665
Okay, okay, don't get
your antennas in a twist.

12:08.681 --> 12:10.808
Why didn't you tell us
one of your people was aboard?

12:11.016 --> 12:12.768
It's an Earth vessel. I didn't know.

12:12.977 --> 12:15.896
What does that mean, Earth?
What is that?

12:16.105 --> 12:18.190
It's where we're from.

12:18.566 --> 12:20.067
It's our homeworld.

12:20.276 --> 12:22.069
Why did you come here?

12:22.611 --> 12:24.697
Answer me, pink skin!

12:27.826 --> 12:30.495
This planet was along our course.

12:30.954 --> 12:32.789
We only came to visit the sanctuary.

12:32.998 --> 12:34.541
Liar.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.252
What's your mission?

12:37.877 --> 12:41.881
Are you a supply ship bringing them
more surveillance equipment?

12:42.132 --> 12:44.384
- We're not bringing them anything.
- You brought her.

12:44.592 --> 12:45.885
She's my science officer.

12:46.094 --> 12:48.388
So you admit
you're working with the Vulcans.

12:48.596 --> 12:51.558
I'll admit I have a Vulcan
science officer...

12:51.766 --> 12:56.521
...and that I came here out of curiosity.
Now, if you don't mind my asking...

12:56.729 --> 12:58.940
...what are you doing here?

13:01.735 --> 13:02.945
Hey.

13:05.197 --> 13:08.784
He's telling the truth.
We came for a visit. That's all.

13:08.993 --> 13:11.412
We scanned your ship in orbit.

13:12.288 --> 13:16.083
You're very well-armed for people
who "came for a visit. "

13:18.252 --> 13:19.920
You...

13:20.546 --> 13:24.633
...and the pink skins have proven
what we already knew.

13:25.426 --> 13:29.138
This is far more than a sanctuary.

13:39.274 --> 13:40.984
I'll enjoy having you...

13:41.192 --> 13:43.069
...as a prisoner.

13:52.662 --> 13:54.831
Now, these guys are agitated.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.843
They're Andorians, captain.

14:07.344 --> 14:10.431
They're known for their suspicious
and volatile nature.

14:10.639 --> 14:13.142
- Andorians?
- Yes, sir.

14:13.350 --> 14:16.520
Our two species
are from neighbouring systems.

14:16.728 --> 14:20.566
We've been in conflict for many years.

14:20.774 --> 14:25.571
They resent our superior reasoning
and our technology.

14:25.779 --> 14:28.115
They even believe that we intend
to mount an invasion

14:28.323 --> 14:29.533
on their homeworld.

14:29.741 --> 14:33.078
In order to alleviate tensions,
we negotiated a treaty,

14:33.286 --> 14:37.249
but some Andorian factions
still believe we're bent on conquest.

14:37.457 --> 14:39.626
What do they want
with a 3,000-year-old temple?

14:39.835 --> 14:42.922
They believe we are hiding
a long-range sensor array.

14:45.049 --> 14:47.093
This is a place
of introspection, captain.

14:47.301 --> 14:50.263
There are no spies here,
and no technology.

14:51.347 --> 14:53.516
So, what are you gonna do,
just sit here

14:53.724 --> 14:55.893
and let them ransack the place?

14:56.102 --> 14:59.146
Typically, they make a great display
of their indignance.

14:59.981 --> 15:02.650
When they find nothing, they leave.

15:03.150 --> 15:06.654
The Andorians were here twice before
and both times left within a day.

15:07.530 --> 15:11.659
Unfortunately, your arrival
has amplified their suspicions.

15:12.201 --> 15:14.705
You've endangered us all.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.504
No good deed goes unpunished.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.550
The shuttle should have sensed it.

15:26.758 --> 15:29.427
They went to visit some monks.
Why would they scan for alien ships?

15:29.636 --> 15:31.763
It should be standard procedure,
that's why.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.933
- In any event, there it is.
- There what is?

15:35.141 --> 15:38.645
A vessel, not Vulcan, and it's less than
one kilometre from our shuttlepod.

15:38.853 --> 15:41.398
Not a lot of room
on that landing platform.

15:41.606 --> 15:43.108
Maybe they're
just some other visitors.

15:43.316 --> 15:45.652
Well, I for one, would like to know
who these visitors are.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.738
And why haven't we heard
from the landing party?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.533
You can't expect them to check in
every ten minutes.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.327
Maybe that should be
standard procedure as well.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.831
You sure you're not overreacting?
They're probably just taking a tour,

15:57.039 --> 15:59.583
observing some kind
of meditation ritual.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.379
Where's the sensor array?

16:04.421 --> 16:06.048
From what I'm told...

16:06.257 --> 16:08.008
...there isn't one.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.761
Where is it?

16:13.264 --> 16:14.974
I don't know.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.814
You humans obviously have emotions.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.986
I find it curious that you'd select
a Vulcan as your science officer.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.030
Believe me, she wasn't my first choice.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.866
Why a Vulcan?

16:38.123 --> 16:40.375
Why a Vulcan?

16:45.213 --> 16:46.881
She was...

16:47.090 --> 16:50.635
...assigned to us by the
Vulcan High Command.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.931
You take orders
from the High Command?

16:54.139 --> 16:55.557
No.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.644
For the last time...

16:58.852 --> 17:01.063
...we just came to see the temple.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.983
That's my ship.

17:06.652 --> 17:08.362
Enterprise.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.281
They're trying to contact me.

17:30.969 --> 17:33.763
- Enterprise.
- Yes.

17:33.972 --> 17:35.515
I'm looking for Captain Archer.

17:35.623 --> 17:38.559
He's a prisoner
of the Andorian Imperial Guard.

17:38.768 --> 17:41.896
We know you're in collaboration
with the Vulcans.

17:42.105 --> 17:43.147
Let me talk to the captain.

17:43.356 --> 17:45.817
Your ship is under
constant surveillance.

17:46.025 --> 17:48.736
Arm your weapons or make
any attempt to approach the surface,

17:48.945 --> 17:51.322
and I'll kill the hostages.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.409
Wait.

17:56.494 --> 17:59.288
- I've lost the signal.
- Try T'Pol.

17:59.498 --> 18:01.375
Or Commander Tucker.

18:11.593 --> 18:13.345
- No response.
- Have the launch bay

18:13.553 --> 18:15.180
put Shuttlepod Two on standby.

18:15.389 --> 18:17.557
You heard what he said.
If we try to send more people...

18:17.766 --> 18:19.726
I don't take orders
from a com voice, ensign.

18:19.935 --> 18:22.562
Not unless that voice
belongs to the captain.

18:22.854 --> 18:24.231
Take a look at the Vulcan database.

18:24.439 --> 18:26.608
See if it has anything
on these Andorians.

18:26.817 --> 18:27.901
Aye, sir.

18:32.322 --> 18:34.450
We've searched all the chambers
in the eastern tower.

18:34.659 --> 18:37.161
- Have you checked the living quarters?
- Not yet.

18:43.209 --> 18:46.462
Perhaps if we decapitate
one or two of those monks,

18:46.879 --> 18:49.215
he'll start telling us the truth.

18:54.679 --> 18:56.889
Is that something...

18:57.598 --> 19:00.393
...you could live with, captain?

19:01.602 --> 19:04.522
I've already told you the truth.

19:13.740 --> 19:16.243
How long have you lived
on the Earth ship?

19:16.451 --> 19:18.036
Nine weeks...

19:18.578 --> 19:20.330
...and four days.

19:20.538 --> 19:22.540
The smell must be intolerable.

19:22.749 --> 19:24.626
You get used to it.

19:25.043 --> 19:27.837
And I was given
a nasal numbing agent.

19:38.431 --> 19:41.268
Whose idea was it to visit this place?

19:45.064 --> 19:47.483
These guys are serious.

19:51.237 --> 19:54.990
They'll start killing you people if they
don't find what they're looking for.

19:55.199 --> 19:56.575
There is nothing to find.

19:57.243 --> 19:59.370
I don't think they're buying that.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.164
Not this time.

20:04.708 --> 20:06.835
Looks like there are four of them.

20:07.044 --> 20:10.005
I saw some kind of scanning console.

20:12.092 --> 20:15.053
They talked a lot
about searching rooms.

20:16.054 --> 20:18.264
You'd think they could find
whatever they're looking for...

20:18.473 --> 20:20.683
...with those antennas of theirs.

20:21.267 --> 20:23.686
They answered a hail from Enterprise.

20:24.687 --> 20:26.898
They threatened to kill us all
if anyone tries a rescue.

20:27.482 --> 20:29.400
Mr Reed wouldn't be that reckless.

20:29.609 --> 20:33.905
I didn't recruit my tactical officer
to sit on his butt when he's threatened.

20:36.074 --> 20:39.160
The Andorians smashed
our communicators.

20:40.995 --> 20:43.706
The longer we're out of contact...

20:43.915 --> 20:45.709
...the more likely...

20:45.918 --> 20:50.089
...Malcolm will put together
a landing party.

20:51.006 --> 20:52.508
Warning or no warning.

20:52.716 --> 20:55.344
Knowing him,
a heavily armed landing party.

20:55.552 --> 20:57.596
It's just a matter of time.

20:58.722 --> 21:01.517
So if anyone has a suggestion...

21:02.309 --> 21:04.102
...I'm all ears.

21:05.521 --> 21:07.314
No offence.

21:09.524 --> 21:10.859
There is an option.

21:11.068 --> 21:13.570
A transmitter. It's very old.

21:13.904 --> 21:16.031
You said you had no technology.

21:16.239 --> 21:19.285
It hasn't been used in many years.
It may not even be working.

21:19.494 --> 21:21.829
I never met a busted radio
I couldn't fix.

21:22.246 --> 21:26.125
Where is this transmitter?

21:28.169 --> 21:29.587
In the catacombs.

21:32.006 --> 21:33.091
Catacombs.

21:34.634 --> 21:36.844
Please listen to me, captain.

21:37.053 --> 21:39.263
There are hidden passages beneath us

21:39.472 --> 21:41.849
where we keep
our most sacred relics,

21:42.058 --> 21:43.976
our honoured dead.

21:48.022 --> 21:49.982
If the Andorians discover them,

21:50.191 --> 21:53.278
they will damage our culture
in ways you can't begin to understand.

21:59.993 --> 22:04.122
For people without emotion,
you sure have a flair for the dramatic.

23:16.196 --> 23:18.281
Master Haadok...

23:18.615 --> 23:20.909
...one of the founders of P'Jem.

23:21.409 --> 23:23.620
The transmitter is this way.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.876
Fellas.

23:55.194 --> 23:56.612
What's down there?

23:56.820 --> 23:58.405
The reliquary.

23:58.614 --> 24:02.117
Our most sacred artefacts
are kept there. This is the transmitter.

24:20.929 --> 24:23.514
Looks like a krellide power cell.

25:04.056 --> 25:05.265
There is one to spare.

25:05.474 --> 25:07.976
No, thanks. It'll just get in my way.

25:11.105 --> 25:13.608
It's only going to get colder.

25:16.194 --> 25:17.653
You take it.

25:17.862 --> 25:19.947
You need it more than I do.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.918
Do the Andorians
have a transporter?

25:32.126 --> 25:33.544
No.

25:34.420 --> 25:36.881
That gives us the element of surprise.

25:38.424 --> 25:40.551
We could bring an assault team
right into the atrium.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.054
The sound of the transporter alone
would alert the guards.

25:43.554 --> 25:47.309
They'd start firing before the team
was fully resequenced.

25:47.517 --> 25:49.269
What about this room?

25:49.978 --> 25:52.355
By the time the Andorians detected
the transport,

25:52.564 --> 25:55.066
- we'd be armed and ready.
- For what?

25:55.317 --> 25:57.903
A firefight in close quarters...

25:58.111 --> 25:59.779
...with a dozen monks at risk?

25:59.988 --> 26:02.115
If you've got any better ideas...

26:10.165 --> 26:11.833
There's room in here.

26:12.042 --> 26:14.461
- I'm fine.
- You're freezing.

26:15.045 --> 26:18.966
It's been 24 hours
since I took my nasal numbing agent.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.719
The cold is preferable to the odour.

26:22.428 --> 26:23.721
Come on.

26:42.406 --> 26:44.992
An armed assault
would put all of our lives at risk.

26:45.409 --> 26:49.038
Not to mention the destruction
of the sanctuary itself.

26:49.246 --> 26:52.292
I'd say our lives are already at risk.

26:52.500 --> 26:56.212
Tensions between Andoria
and Vulcan are high.

26:56.546 --> 26:59.174
Any casualties
would only make matters worse.

27:01.801 --> 27:04.596
It seems like you're letting them
walk all over you.

27:05.096 --> 27:08.141
They come in here, they smash
your relics, they beat up your people...

27:08.349 --> 27:10.727
...then you just sit back
and wait for them to walk away?

27:10.935 --> 27:15.565
We don't believe in responding
to violence with violence.

27:15.773 --> 27:18.026
I admire your ethics...

27:18.234 --> 27:21.529
...but right now,
a little violence might help.

27:21.988 --> 27:24.867
You're beginning to sound
like an Andorian.

27:25.367 --> 27:29.079
You know, I came here hoping to gain
a little insight into the Vulcan mind...

27:29.288 --> 27:30.831
...it looks like I'm getting it.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.876
You people think
you're so damned enlightened.

27:34.251 --> 27:35.294
Problem?

27:44.887 --> 27:48.140
I'd like to find a peaceful solution too.

27:48.849 --> 27:51.268
But I don't think
that's gonna happen.

27:54.354 --> 27:56.566
However we end up
dealing with this,

27:56.774 --> 27:58.526
I need to know I can count on you.

27:59.277 --> 28:01.362
Are you questioning my loyalty?

28:02.071 --> 28:04.198
I just wanna know where we stand.

28:05.325 --> 28:09.412
I have never disobeyed your orders.

28:27.638 --> 28:30.726
Sir, you're wearing a hole
in the deck plating.

28:31.435 --> 28:33.979
- What is it?
- Transmission from the surface.

28:34.187 --> 28:36.607
It's a modulated EM signal.
Very weak.

28:37.065 --> 28:38.650
Put it through.

28:39.693 --> 28:42.446
Enterprise, this is Commander Tucker.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.699
Repeat. Enterprise,
this is Commander Tucker.

28:45.907 --> 28:48.493
This is Enterprise. We can barely
read you, commander.

28:48.702 --> 28:50.704
- What's your status?
- Guess you heard.

28:50.912 --> 28:53.707
We kind of walked into a hostage
situation. The whole place

28:53.915 --> 28:56.585
- has been taken over by Andorians...
- Andorians, yes.

28:56.793 --> 28:59.212
I've been reading about them
in the Vulcan database.

28:59.421 --> 29:01.715
- Militaristic, blue-skinned.
- That's them.

29:01.923 --> 29:03.426
Well, what do they want?

29:03.634 --> 29:07.305
They seem to think this place
is some kind of a spy station.

29:07.513 --> 29:11.058
They're looking for a sensor array.
The captain says to sit tight.

29:11.267 --> 29:13.853
He doesn't wanna provoke them
any more than we already have.

29:14.061 --> 29:17.356
He also said to tell you
we're working on a way out of here.

29:17.648 --> 29:19.400
Are you certain we can't negotiate?

29:19.608 --> 29:23.195
The captain came back from his last
negotiation with a face full of bruises.

29:23.946 --> 29:26.824
- We'll be in touch.
- Understood.

29:34.415 --> 29:37.002
Do any of these tunnels
lead to the outside?

29:37.210 --> 29:38.628
No.

29:40.172 --> 29:42.507
What about this reliquary?

29:42.716 --> 29:46.469
- No one's entered it in years.
- To do so would be blasphemy.

29:46.678 --> 29:49.014
I saw an old stairwell down there.

29:49.222 --> 29:51.224
Maybe a metre wide. It was...

29:51.433 --> 29:53.351
...right about here.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.313
That would almost be
directly beneath the atrium.

29:56.521 --> 29:59.524
There were three dim lights
coming from the top. It looked...

29:59.733 --> 30:02.027
...something like this.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.244
How many times do we have
to search the same rooms?

30:10.453 --> 30:11.912
Are you losing faith in our mission?

30:12.121 --> 30:16.041
We've looked everywhere.
We've run a thousand scans.

30:18.502 --> 30:23.257
The Vulcans are very deceptive.

30:24.925 --> 30:26.343
It's here.

30:26.844 --> 30:28.554
I'm sure of it.

30:29.722 --> 30:34.935
If we back down now, everything
we've fought for is meaningless.

30:35.144 --> 30:37.896
If nothing else, remember that, Keval.

30:38.272 --> 30:39.440
Hey!

30:39.648 --> 30:41.108
Can you hear me?

30:41.316 --> 30:42.861
Hello.

30:43.486 --> 30:45.321
Anybody out there?

30:56.124 --> 30:58.334
I need to speak with you alone.

30:58.793 --> 31:01.045
I have some information for you.

31:12.890 --> 31:14.392
What is it?

31:14.892 --> 31:17.229
Well, for one thing, I...

31:17.438 --> 31:19.356
...needed some fresh air.

31:19.732 --> 31:21.859
You ever been stuck
in a room of Vulcans for 12 hours?

31:22.067 --> 31:23.694
- The information.
- I'll bet their robes

31:23.902 --> 31:26.488
haven't been washed
since the time of Surak.

31:26.697 --> 31:28.907
Have you heard of him?
Vulcan philosopher.

31:29.116 --> 31:33.287
He's the one who got everybody
to start purging their emotions.

31:33.495 --> 31:37.708
I don't know about you, but I've learned
really a lot since I got here.

31:42.337 --> 31:44.923
What did you come to tell us?

31:45.340 --> 31:47.342
Well, that depends.

31:47.718 --> 31:49.470
What do you want to know?

31:54.559 --> 31:56.853
All right, information.

31:58.730 --> 32:00.481
Did you know that...

32:01.315 --> 32:03.359
...over 70 percent of the organisms

32:03.568 --> 32:06.779
- on my homeworld are bacteria?
- What?

32:06.988 --> 32:09.740
And here's something I think
you'll find interesting.

32:10.366 --> 32:11.659
There was a man in Canton, Ohio

32:11.868 --> 32:17.206
who once rolled a ball of string
over 6 metres in diameter.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.711
He's wasting our time. Take him back.

32:21.920 --> 32:25.299
There was a famous astronomer
on Earth...

32:27.592 --> 32:29.469
...Tycho Brahe.

32:29.678 --> 32:32.639
He lost his nose in a duel...

32:33.807 --> 32:35.726
...over a math equation.

32:38.186 --> 32:40.439
You must enjoy pain.

32:41.857 --> 32:46.236
Please. Please, I can't stand
another minute with the Vulcans.

32:46.444 --> 32:47.946
Please.

33:29.573 --> 33:31.658
A light at the end of the tunnel.

33:32.701 --> 33:35.495
- You know what to do, commander.
- Yes, sir.

33:35.870 --> 33:37.414
I don't have to tell you, captain.

33:37.622 --> 33:39.833
We don't condone these actions
you are about to take.

33:40.041 --> 33:43.128
No, you don't have to tell me.

33:43.545 --> 33:46.881
Just try and stay out of the way,
and everything will work out fine.

33:49.759 --> 33:51.469
- Phase pistols on stun.
- Stun, sir?

33:51.678 --> 33:54.472
The captain's instructions
were quite explicit.

33:57.350 --> 33:59.394
It's a console, ensign. It won't bite.

33:59.686 --> 34:02.690
No, it'll just scramble your molecules.

34:03.732 --> 34:06.777
- Crewman?
- We've heard stories, sir.

34:06.986 --> 34:10.114
- It might not be safe.
- I've heard the same stories.

34:10.322 --> 34:12.241
Now, get up here.

34:13.617 --> 34:14.868
Coordinates set?

34:15.077 --> 34:16.370
Aye, sir.

34:16.578 --> 34:18.121
Then energize...

34:18.330 --> 34:20.623
...before we change our minds.

34:31.677 --> 34:35.598
- What is it?
- Some kind of energy fluctuation.

34:45.733 --> 34:49.821
We detected an energy surge.
It came from this chamber.

34:50.029 --> 34:52.782
Perhaps you have faulty equipment.

34:52.991 --> 34:56.703
Or perhaps you have equipment
we don't know about.

35:02.542 --> 35:04.043
Watch them.

35:19.935 --> 35:21.520
This is it.

35:29.778 --> 35:32.614
Most Vulcans smell of dust.

35:34.950 --> 35:36.368
But you're different.

35:36.576 --> 35:37.911
Something sure smells.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.873
Did you say something, pink skin?

36:00.601 --> 36:01.852
This can't be right.

36:02.061 --> 36:04.814
I'm detecting three new bio-signs.

36:05.189 --> 36:07.608
- All human.
- Where are they?

36:07.817 --> 36:09.402
They're within 20 metres.

36:09.819 --> 36:13.197
- Where?!
- I can't pinpoint the signal.

36:13.406 --> 36:16.284
Try boosting the proximity sensors.

36:20.539 --> 36:23.500
I've heard about your mating rituals.

36:24.292 --> 36:29.214
That Vulcan women force their men
to fight each other to the death.

36:30.882 --> 36:34.135
Would you like me
to kill someone for you?

36:37.806 --> 36:39.516
Leave her alone.

36:43.937 --> 36:46.439
Would you like me to kill him?

36:53.364 --> 36:54.782
Find them.

36:54.990 --> 36:56.867
They're very close.

37:18.430 --> 37:21.142
- Will you be all right?
- Go ahead. I'll cover here.

37:21.351 --> 37:22.811
Keval!

37:33.279 --> 37:34.739
This way.

37:51.464 --> 37:53.759
Two of them got away.
They went down into the catacombs.

37:53.968 --> 37:57.429
I hope you're pleased. You've turned
a place of solitude into a war zone.

37:58.097 --> 38:00.557
- Where are the phase pistols?
- Here, sir.

38:04.937 --> 38:07.481
If he wakes up, stun him again.

38:12.111 --> 38:13.862
Let's go.

38:14.071 --> 38:16.990
- I'm going with you.
- Violence is no longer our way.

38:17.616 --> 38:20.536
We must protect what is ours.

38:38.388 --> 38:41.516
They're down this passage.
Thirty metres.

38:42.266 --> 38:43.351
It leads to the reliquary.

38:43.559 --> 38:45.645
Only members of the high order
are allowed inside.

38:45.853 --> 38:48.648
- We'll try not to look at anything.
- I can't permit it, captain.

38:48.856 --> 38:50.691
What would you suggest we do?

38:50.900 --> 38:52.318
I'll disarm them myself.

38:52.527 --> 38:54.570
You ever use one of those?

38:55.363 --> 38:58.074
I didn't think so. The Andorians
have seen your sacred relics.

38:58.282 --> 39:00.869
A couple humans won't make
much of a difference.

39:43.913 --> 39:44.914
Captain.

40:18.782 --> 40:19.908
Hold your fire.

40:21.409 --> 40:24.037
You might want to take a look at this.

40:52.191 --> 40:54.360
I don't believe this.

41:05.871 --> 41:08.499
Does that thing
have imaging sensors?

41:08.707 --> 41:09.958
Yes.

41:11.251 --> 41:14.005
Take all the pictures you can.

41:15.632 --> 41:17.092
Place your weapons on the ground.

41:17.300 --> 41:21.679
I will kill him if necessary.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.810
Give that to me.

41:34.859 --> 41:38.905
- Violence in a sanctuary, captain.
- Very disrespectful.

41:39.113 --> 41:41.157
Boy, did it feel good.

41:42.909 --> 41:44.994
All this time...

41:46.121 --> 41:47.748
...they've been
calling these monks liars,

41:47.956 --> 41:50.042
and all this time, they've been right.

41:50.250 --> 41:51.752
They've got enough equipment
down there

41:51.960 --> 41:54.922
to see what any Andorian
is having for breakfast.

41:56.006 --> 41:57.966
I've completed my scans.

41:58.175 --> 41:59.551
Give it to him.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.970
- Sir?
- Give it to him.

42:10.020 --> 42:12.773
You've got what you came for.
Now get out of here.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.108
How do we know
you won't attack our vessel?

42:15.734 --> 42:20.031
The Vulcans violated your treaty.
Your people ought to know about it.

42:20.490 --> 42:22.617
You have a problem with that?

42:25.620 --> 42:27.080
Your communicator.

42:33.336 --> 42:35.755
- T'Pol to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

42:35.963 --> 42:39.926
The Andorian ship will be leaving
the surface momentarily.

42:41.093 --> 42:44.138
- They're free to go.
- Acknowledged.

42:55.859 --> 42:57.653
We're in your debt.

43:08.580 --> 43:09.998
Thanks for the tour.
