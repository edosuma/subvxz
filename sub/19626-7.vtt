00:26.830 --> 00:29.946
_

00:30.066 --> 00:31.500
Dinner with your parents?

00:31.534 --> 00:33.135
Uh, sure.

00:33.169 --> 00:36.009
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I mean...

00:36.784 --> 00:38.163
Because...

00:42.058 --> 00:43.558
What?

00:43.678 --> 00:46.482
You don't sound all that sure.

00:46.516 --> 00:48.817
It's...

00:48.852 --> 00:50.586
I think you're really gonna like them.

00:50.620 --> 00:53.088
And they're gonna love you.

00:53.123 --> 00:54.990
Well, I'm not sure about that.

00:55.024 --> 00:57.206
They already do.

00:58.261 --> 01:00.195
What? What did you tell them?

01:00.230 --> 01:03.165
About you? Hmm, let me see now.

01:03.199 --> 01:05.000
- You know what I mean.
- They knew Cali.

01:05.034 --> 01:06.591
They adored Cali.

01:06.711 --> 01:09.905
Did I forget to tell you that
your loving little sister

01:09.939 --> 01:13.275
used to brag about you, like, a lot?

01:13.309 --> 01:15.454
- What if they don't like me?
- Seriously?

01:15.574 --> 01:17.100
- It's possible.
- No, I mean

01:17.220 --> 01:19.848
you seriously care if they like you?

01:19.883 --> 01:21.683
Mm, that's so sweet.

01:22.952 --> 01:25.120
Now you're making fun.

01:25.155 --> 01:28.891
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone
how sweet you really are.

01:38.067 --> 01:41.402
Do I want the soufflé?

01:41.522 --> 01:43.539
Um, I don't know.

01:43.573 --> 01:46.041
I-I hadn't really thought that far.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.791
Well, if Chef insists I'm having

01:52.911 --> 01:55.230
the soufflé and we're his
guests, then I'm pretty sure

01:55.350 --> 01:57.686
that means I'm having the soufflé.

02:00.323 --> 02:03.125
Yes, I understand how soufflés are made,

02:03.159 --> 02:06.228
thank you, and I just told
you I'm 20 minutes out.

02:06.262 --> 02:08.310
Harry, if...

02:08.430 --> 02:11.800
I said I'll be there,
and so I'll be there.

02:14.337 --> 02:17.940
Uh, I'm about to lose you.
I'm headed into the elevator.

02:19.949 --> 02:21.340
Bye.

02:25.815 --> 02:27.483
To save you the trouble,

02:27.517 --> 02:29.957
I'm going to dinner with
an old friend, Harry,

02:30.077 --> 02:32.555
whose college roommate,
it turns out, owns Zola.

02:32.589 --> 02:34.623
Francois Zola, the celebrity chef?

02:34.658 --> 02:36.492
What have you got?

02:36.526 --> 02:38.627
Tomas Vitek just popped up on the radar.

02:38.662 --> 02:40.496
Where?

02:41.882 --> 02:43.807
Dressed as a priest?

02:43.927 --> 02:45.968
According to the Brits,
in transit from Poland.

02:46.002 --> 02:47.970
Francois Zola was gonna cook you dinner?

02:48.004 --> 02:49.972
- When was this?
- 9:28 this morning.

02:50.006 --> 02:51.674
- Our time or theirs?
- Theirs.

02:51.708 --> 02:53.542
He took a 10:17 flight from Heathrow

02:53.577 --> 02:55.978
to Montreal-Trudeau, which
landed three hours ago.

02:56.012 --> 02:59.035
- And we're just finding out now?
- At least the Brits caught it.

02:59.155 --> 03:01.906
Better late than never. Montreal
airport cameras picked him up

03:02.026 --> 03:04.753
taking a cab to a nearby
hotel and then, poof, gone.

03:04.788 --> 03:07.471
- Anything on the cab?
- Stolen. Ringer plates.

03:07.591 --> 03:08.991
Ping Bryan.

03:09.025 --> 03:11.360
- Bryan?
- Tell him I'm on my way.

03:11.394 --> 03:12.661
Okay.

03:13.597 --> 03:14.897
What?

03:14.931 --> 03:17.914
- Just Bryan?
- For now. That a problem?

03:18.034 --> 03:19.835
Just checking.

03:19.869 --> 03:22.004
We're gonna need the helicopter.

03:22.038 --> 03:23.505
Uh, one more thing.

03:23.540 --> 03:24.773
What?

03:24.808 --> 03:28.080
Probably respectful to
cancel the soufflé.

03:28.612 --> 03:30.679
Thanks.

03:40.156 --> 03:42.391
Hold that thought.

03:45.105 --> 03:47.444
- What is it?
- I got to go.

03:47.564 --> 03:49.617
- Right now?
- Yeah.

03:51.601 --> 03:53.936
At... Ten after midnight?

03:53.970 --> 03:56.229
I'll let you know about getting
together with your folks.

03:56.349 --> 03:59.942
How do I know it's not a ploy
for you to get out of it?

03:59.976 --> 04:02.044
You got me.

04:05.081 --> 04:06.755
Mmm.

04:08.327 --> 04:10.052
Mm, mm. No.

04:10.086 --> 04:11.820
No, no, no, no.

04:11.855 --> 04:13.615
I got to go.

04:14.424 --> 04:17.059
Bye.

04:22.866 --> 04:25.875
We've been trying to get a hold
of you for the past 15 minutes.

04:25.995 --> 04:27.325
I was asleep.

04:28.438 --> 04:30.673
Tomas Vitek... Believed to be the man

04:30.707 --> 04:34.267
behind a catalog of arms deals
supplying military-grade

04:34.387 --> 04:37.579
weapons in bulk to everything
from coups and dictators

04:37.614 --> 04:39.815
to terrorists and the cartel.

04:39.849 --> 04:42.918
The Cartel? Singular?

04:42.952 --> 04:45.587
- Well, more specifically...
- The Mejia Cartel.

04:45.707 --> 04:48.757
So you're telling me the
weapons used by the men

04:48.792 --> 04:50.859
who murdered my sister
were supplied by him?

04:50.894 --> 04:54.596
According to the FBI,
almost certainly, yes.

04:54.631 --> 04:57.599
So now we're gonna find him.

04:57.634 --> 05:00.517
- That's today's date time-code.
- Correct again.

05:22.225 --> 05:24.693
This should be interesting.

05:24.728 --> 05:27.162
Can't even imagine
what that must feel like.

05:27.197 --> 05:30.265
Face-to-face with
your sister's murderer?

05:40.009 --> 05:41.643
Why make him do this?

05:41.678 --> 05:43.757
- To face his demons?
- Or maybe it's

05:43.877 --> 05:47.361
her way of showing him she's
finally starting to trust him.

05:50.502 --> 05:52.679
_

05:58.728 --> 06:01.764
- What's this?
- Look at the picture.

06:02.866 --> 06:06.268
Do they think sending you
in here will intimidate me?

06:06.302 --> 06:10.072
Word on the street is you
don't need much intimidating.

06:10.106 --> 06:12.174
Every time they've asked
you to rat someone out,

06:12.208 --> 06:14.076
you've barely blinked.

06:17.580 --> 06:19.248
What is this?

06:21.818 --> 06:23.338
It's a test.

06:26.589 --> 06:28.781
A psychological test...

06:30.293 --> 06:32.694
To see if I've gotten past my need

06:32.729 --> 06:36.765
to rip out your throat
for murdering my sister.

06:39.769 --> 06:41.313
Truth is...

06:41.905 --> 06:44.106
That desire to avenge her murder

06:44.140 --> 06:46.412
will never completely go away.

06:47.777 --> 06:50.846
It's an unrealistic expectation.

06:53.428 --> 06:55.884
It's not like there's
a Tibetan monastery

06:55.919 --> 06:58.620
in my future or anything like that.

07:01.124 --> 07:04.293
But can I control the urge to kill you?

07:06.596 --> 07:08.260
I'm getting there.

07:09.410 --> 07:11.233
Now look at the picture.

07:13.269 --> 07:14.970
I've never seen him.

07:15.004 --> 07:18.574
See, I happen to know that
he supplied the weapons

07:18.608 --> 07:22.244
your men used to murder my sister.

07:22.504 --> 07:23.847
But okay...

07:24.180 --> 07:25.667
What are you doing?

07:27.116 --> 07:29.351
If it were up to me...

07:29.385 --> 07:32.154
I'd throw you over
the side, but it isn't.

07:32.188 --> 07:34.089
So now you're no use to us,

07:34.123 --> 07:36.792
it's time to transfer you
to a federal facility.

07:36.826 --> 07:38.093
Where?

07:38.127 --> 07:40.128
What does it matter?

07:40.163 --> 07:42.297
They're all the same for
bitches and snitches.

07:42.332 --> 07:43.599
Open up!

07:43.633 --> 07:45.167
Wait.

07:45.201 --> 07:46.301
Wait!

07:46.336 --> 07:47.803
Hold it!

07:51.374 --> 07:52.875
Tomas Vitek.

07:52.995 --> 07:54.710
Tell me something I don't know.

07:54.744 --> 07:56.345
Let me see the picture again.

08:01.417 --> 08:03.118
Montreal.

08:04.988 --> 08:06.822
Keep talking.

08:06.856 --> 08:09.224
If he's there, someone...

08:09.259 --> 08:11.827
Someone is making a
move from the north...

08:11.861 --> 08:15.233
Someone who needs a lot of firepower.

08:15.865 --> 08:17.966
Have you ever met him up there?

08:21.838 --> 08:25.407
Yes. I met him there once before.

08:25.441 --> 08:27.069
Where?

08:31.483 --> 08:34.339

08:36.962 --> 08:39.214
_

08:45.890 --> 08:47.933
Can I ask you something?

08:48.927 --> 08:50.848
I'd like Montreal.

08:51.562 --> 08:53.831
And you miss being in the field?

08:53.865 --> 08:55.833
Zero, this is Alpha. Radio check.

08:55.867 --> 08:57.201
Great jazz.

08:57.235 --> 08:59.081
Zero, Roger. Strength... ten.

09:00.271 --> 09:02.645
The food, the food is to die for.

09:06.911 --> 09:08.846
Target on the move. Stand by.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.348
We've got eyes on Vitek and two others.

09:18.123 --> 09:20.057
Long leash, let the dog run.

09:20.177 --> 09:23.160
- Alpha, Roger.
- Mobile one following.

09:23.194 --> 09:25.496
Why, do you have a problem
with me being in the field?

09:25.530 --> 09:28.399
No. I'm good.

09:57.462 --> 09:59.830
Merci.

10:07.105 --> 10:08.939
Mailman, 11 o'clock.

10:13.111 --> 10:15.779
The first cab in the cab
line has passed on two fares

10:15.814 --> 10:17.915
since we sat down.

10:37.435 --> 10:39.069
Are you getting this?

10:39.104 --> 10:41.238
Like we're right there with you.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.054
The game just changed.

11:00.658 --> 11:02.259
Dog find a bone?

11:02.293 --> 11:05.562
No. He found a much bigger dog.

11:07.499 --> 11:10.434
Wait, is that Jimmy Dunne?

11:10.468 --> 11:13.657
And I think we just
found our weapons buyer.

11:18.343 --> 11:20.010
- Be right back.
- What are you doing?

11:20.044 --> 11:22.179
- I got this.
- Sit d...

11:22.213 --> 11:25.015
Bryan, get back here, right now.

11:29.809 --> 11:32.456
The guy was involved in
his sister's murder.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.308
He's not gonna let this go.

11:45.537 --> 11:47.871
It worked. I got away with it.

11:47.906 --> 11:49.907
How do you know you got away with it?

11:49.941 --> 11:52.686
The answer is you don't. Do you
even know who Jimmy Dunne is?

11:52.806 --> 11:55.546
He's a mobster, like that Whitey Bulger.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.381
Dunne is in an
entirely different league.

11:57.415 --> 12:00.984
He used to own the top
corner and Whitey Bulger.

12:01.019 --> 12:02.553
Do you know what the top corner is?

12:02.587 --> 12:04.655
New York, Boston, Chicago,
everything in between.

12:04.689 --> 12:07.057
Look, you knew I wasn't
gonna risk losing Vitek.

12:07.091 --> 12:09.560
Your personal agenda cannot
contaminate this operation.

12:09.594 --> 12:12.362
Says the person who pushed
that connection in first place.

12:12.397 --> 12:16.400
In 2006, the Feds hit Dunne
with a 36-count indictment...

12:16.434 --> 12:19.403
Everything from human
trafficking to murder.

12:19.437 --> 12:21.849
Then somehow he just
vanishes into thin air

12:21.969 --> 12:25.576
moments before the Feds hit his
compound to make the arrest.

12:25.610 --> 12:27.244
Eight days later,

12:27.278 --> 12:29.913
the Mejia Cartel rolls
into the top corner

12:29.948 --> 12:32.082
and takes over.

12:32.116 --> 12:34.518
Are you beginning to get the picture?

12:34.552 --> 12:37.020
Now that Mejia's gone,
Dunne's planning a comeback.

12:37.055 --> 12:38.434
And you may have just blown

12:38.554 --> 12:40.457
our one and only
chance to get up on him.

12:40.491 --> 12:43.260
Boss? We got something.

12:45.159 --> 12:46.671
Don't say a word.

12:47.131 --> 12:50.434
Dumb luck does not
balance out needless risk.

12:53.972 --> 12:55.849
Tomas Vitek and Jimmy Dunne

12:55.969 --> 12:57.474
drove around the city a couple times,

12:57.508 --> 12:59.042
in what was either a mobile meeting,

12:59.077 --> 13:00.944
an attempt at counter
surveillance, or both.

13:00.979 --> 13:02.613
However, thanks to the tracker,

13:02.647 --> 13:05.969
we now have Dunne's vehicle
at Banque Privée on Urbain.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.578
Deal's going down.

13:07.698 --> 13:09.066
- We move in on Dunne?
- Right now?

13:09.186 --> 13:11.465
Against that kind of muscle and
firepower in the middle of Montreal?

13:11.489 --> 13:13.100
When the Canadians don't
even know that we're here?

13:13.124 --> 13:14.602
There's only one thing
that happens in a bank.

13:14.626 --> 13:16.303
And Dunne's not gonna
part with a single cent

13:16.327 --> 13:18.328
until he's already
taken physical delivery

13:18.363 --> 13:19.630
of that weapons shipment.

13:19.664 --> 13:21.265
So we take Vitek

13:21.299 --> 13:23.233
before he's in the wind again,

13:23.268 --> 13:25.135
because him we know about.

13:25.169 --> 13:27.604
We've already done the recon.

13:27.639 --> 13:30.741
He could give us Dunne and the weapons.

13:35.713 --> 13:38.175
You're staying in the van for this one.

13:50.851 --> 13:52.677
_

14:03.061 --> 14:04.556
_

14:04.676 --> 14:07.678
Okay! Okay.

14:41.245 --> 14:43.380
We're on.

14:43.414 --> 14:45.482
We have eyes.

14:50.870 --> 14:52.556
- Hey, Rem, wake up.
- Huh?

15:13.378 --> 15:16.146
- Delta, move now.
- Delta, roger.

15:17.882 --> 15:19.614
Moving in now.

15:21.285 --> 15:22.778
What the...?

15:27.701 --> 15:29.189
_

15:31.629 --> 15:33.563
_

15:50.126 --> 15:51.868
_

15:52.449 --> 15:53.852
_

15:58.156 --> 15:59.689
How you doing today?

16:06.931 --> 16:08.852
Romeo, on the move now.

16:09.348 --> 16:10.734
Right behind you.

16:17.341 --> 16:18.942
GSG9! GSG9!

16:24.625 --> 16:27.576
GSG9! GSG9!

16:27.599 --> 16:30.104
- Germany?
- Counter-Terrorism Task Force.

16:30.224 --> 16:32.536
Cops. How did we not know about that?

16:32.571 --> 16:34.839
Cherry-pick the Montreal
police frequencies.

16:34.873 --> 16:37.374
Put a two-minute block on
all their coms to Germany.

16:37.409 --> 16:39.048
Just getting my ID.

16:43.515 --> 16:45.649
What's GSG9 doing in Montreal?

16:45.684 --> 16:48.018
Joint operation with your
Canadian Intelligence.

16:48.053 --> 16:50.688
Four months of undercover
work ruined, just like that.

16:50.808 --> 16:52.055
Taxi.

17:00.732 --> 17:02.800
Little gift for you.

17:11.609 --> 17:13.944
You're dead! You don't
think I have lookouts?

17:13.979 --> 17:15.799
Huh? Backup?

17:16.982 --> 17:19.550
How come nobody knew the
cops were up on this guy?

17:21.118 --> 17:22.920
They weren't. According
to the police radios,

17:22.954 --> 17:24.954
they were staking out a
crack house two doors down.

17:24.990 --> 17:27.458
Be advised, CSIS just
broke through our block,

17:27.492 --> 17:29.860
and the Germans just denied
any activity in Montreal,

17:29.895 --> 17:32.529
so now everyone and their mother
is gonna be on the warpath.

17:36.686 --> 17:39.036
Here they come.

17:39.070 --> 17:40.471
Hold on.

17:50.482 --> 17:52.116
Look out!

18:33.558 --> 18:35.426
Oh, God bless it.

18:52.717 --> 18:55.446
- We got fleas.
- Two bikes and an SUV.

19:27.779 --> 19:29.980
Everybody out, let's go.

19:35.186 --> 19:37.755
Ditch the van. Bryan, let's go.

19:39.958 --> 19:42.172
What the...

19:42.865 --> 19:46.196
Come on.

19:49.534 --> 19:52.662
- Did he just sacrifice himself for...
- Yes, he did.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.651
Damn it, Bryan.

20:53.198 --> 20:55.829
They got him. They took Bryan.

21:17.889 --> 21:19.792
Tomas Vitek.

21:29.067 --> 21:30.801
Where's Vitek?

21:33.339 --> 21:35.204
Who?

21:50.470 --> 21:51.537
Oh!

22:17.497 --> 22:20.877
Shh, shh, shh. Reality check. The
problem with you Green Berets

22:20.997 --> 22:24.150
is someone told you you're
special, and you bought it.

22:24.270 --> 22:26.814
Rule number one... You ain't special.

22:29.876 --> 22:32.444
If and when your ass ever gets captured,

22:32.479 --> 22:35.781
now's the time, if you're still alive,

22:35.815 --> 22:38.617
to save all your strength for in here.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.755
You don't show anger.

22:42.789 --> 22:44.323
You don't show anything.

22:44.357 --> 22:48.427
You flatline, become
dull, gray, no threat.

22:48.461 --> 22:50.796
A bump on a log.

22:52.927 --> 22:54.299
Who are you?

22:54.334 --> 22:57.822
And then you start to
look for weaknesses,

22:57.942 --> 23:00.472
because your enemy, believe it or not,

23:00.507 --> 23:03.308
is still a human being...

23:04.844 --> 23:08.480
Which means there's
always gonna be something.

23:08.515 --> 23:12.317
So hang in there, be patient.

23:21.594 --> 23:23.582
Once you find a weakness,

23:23.824 --> 23:25.712
one is all you need.

23:25.832 --> 23:27.466
It gives you hope,

23:27.500 --> 23:30.502
which gives you strength
to endure almost anything.

23:34.607 --> 23:36.842
And you can take that
straight to the bank,

23:36.876 --> 23:40.479
because he's been there, done that.

24:03.601 --> 24:04.871
Where'd they take him?

24:04.991 --> 24:06.586
_

24:06.706 --> 24:08.273
We already met, numbnuts.

24:08.308 --> 24:11.999
We know all about you,
Tomas, from Carlos Mejia.

24:12.507 --> 24:13.779
That's right.

24:13.813 --> 24:17.263
- I don't know where they took him.
- I don't believe that.

24:17.383 --> 24:20.352
Not everyone is as weak as Carlos Mejia.

24:20.386 --> 24:21.587
So you do know.

24:26.392 --> 24:28.260
Where did they take him?

24:28.294 --> 24:30.871
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

24:33.433 --> 24:34.700
Ah!

24:45.559 --> 24:47.628
Mm. Mm.

24:50.416 --> 24:52.317
They're pretty sure he's an American.

24:52.352 --> 24:54.095
Where they got him?

24:54.215 --> 24:57.789
Chop Shop in the sticks,
about 30 miles out of town.

24:57.824 --> 24:59.258
He FBI?

24:59.292 --> 25:01.226
He's not talking yet.

25:01.261 --> 25:03.552
Why are you still standing here...

25:04.597 --> 25:08.934
When I got a $10 million
shipment of weapons at stake?

25:08.968 --> 25:12.383
Don't leave it to Vitek's clowns.
You go take care of this.

25:24.951 --> 25:26.405
Hmm?

25:27.353 --> 25:29.816
You a religious man, Bryan?

25:32.325 --> 25:33.625
It's okay.

25:33.660 --> 25:35.961
You can answer. It's
not a trick question.

25:37.664 --> 25:39.531
I've been known to pray.

25:39.566 --> 25:40.766
Yeah.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.035
I know how that goes.

25:43.069 --> 25:45.971
When all else is lost, I mean, why not?

25:47.233 --> 25:49.059
It can't hurt, right?

25:50.009 --> 25:51.677
Right.

25:51.711 --> 25:53.668
So there's that.

25:54.814 --> 25:57.616
Want to know what else there is?

26:01.054 --> 26:02.766
There's your buddies...

26:03.656 --> 26:05.161
The team.

26:06.059 --> 26:07.593
God...

26:08.494 --> 26:10.495
That's your call,

26:10.530 --> 26:12.238
but the team...

26:13.733 --> 26:16.802
Never for one moment
lose faith in the team...

26:19.439 --> 26:21.840
Which is the reason why
you do everything you can

26:21.874 --> 26:24.076
not to talk for as long
as humanly possible...

26:24.110 --> 26:26.478
Not just to save their asses

26:26.512 --> 26:28.670
and the operation...

26:29.415 --> 26:31.550
But to save yourself.

26:33.019 --> 26:34.519
You following me?

26:35.722 --> 26:37.522
Because every hour,

26:37.557 --> 26:39.558
every minute, every
second you don't talk,

26:39.592 --> 26:41.994
you increase the chances

26:42.028 --> 26:43.964
of your buddies...

26:44.597 --> 26:46.395
The team...

26:47.400 --> 26:49.837
God willing, will come back for you,

26:51.938 --> 26:53.472
rescue your ass.

26:58.978 --> 27:01.046
Have a good night.

27:18.286 --> 27:20.666
I need you to look at something.

27:22.068 --> 27:23.902
- Got it.
- See that red dot?

27:24.289 --> 27:26.000
Okay. Now,

27:26.120 --> 27:28.362
red's the live feed from
the tracker Bryan put

27:28.482 --> 27:30.575
on the vehicle outside the brasserie.

27:30.610 --> 27:32.444
Blue's that same vehicle's
pattern of movement

27:32.478 --> 27:34.049
- since he tagged it...
- Riley,

27:34.169 --> 27:35.935
- I need you to hold on a second.
- Oh.

27:36.539 --> 27:37.735
Sure.

27:41.454 --> 27:44.056
Okay, keep going.

27:44.090 --> 27:46.591
For the last 20 minutes,
the tracker-tagged vehicle

27:46.626 --> 27:48.937
has been speeding
northeast from Montreal

27:49.057 --> 27:50.788
for about 30 miles, away from its

27:50.908 --> 27:53.110
established movement pattern.

28:11.818 --> 28:13.085
Can I help you?

28:13.119 --> 28:14.920
We're here to see your guest.

28:14.954 --> 28:15.987
Guest?

28:16.022 --> 28:17.756
I work for Mr. Dunne.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.157
We got this.

28:19.192 --> 28:20.625
Tell Mr. Dunne...

28:44.917 --> 28:47.486
Think. You're not thinking.

28:47.520 --> 28:52.023
You got to make them believe
you're too weak to do anything...

28:52.058 --> 28:54.459
Walk, talk,

28:54.494 --> 28:57.629
drink water, anything.

28:57.663 --> 29:00.031
That is when they decide
to either bring you back

29:00.066 --> 29:01.533
from the brink...

29:02.502 --> 29:04.920
Or put a bullet in your head.

29:06.105 --> 29:08.974
So it's kind of a win-win
if you think about it.

29:09.008 --> 29:12.644
But you're banking on
their egos telling them

29:12.678 --> 29:14.012
they can turn you.

29:16.115 --> 29:19.184
Ego is the key here.

29:22.555 --> 29:24.489
Is he dead yet?

29:24.524 --> 29:26.224
Almost.

29:40.072 --> 29:41.840
Take him down.

29:46.813 --> 29:48.780
Clean him, feed him, hydrate him,

29:48.815 --> 29:50.673
get some clothes on him.

30:19.713 --> 30:21.177
_

30:25.507 --> 30:27.214
What is this?

30:27.249 --> 30:30.051
I told you to clean him
up and take care of him.

30:30.085 --> 30:32.466
Go get him something warm to wear.

30:32.586 --> 30:34.622
Take his cuffs off, please.

30:38.927 --> 30:40.861
The good cop is the closer.

30:42.949 --> 30:46.567
He wants you to believe, to hope...

30:46.601 --> 30:47.958
That he's the only one

30:48.078 --> 30:49.737
that can bring you
back from the brink...

30:49.771 --> 30:51.038
It's all right.

30:51.073 --> 30:53.841
The only one that can save you...

30:53.875 --> 30:55.876
That all he needs for that to happen

30:55.911 --> 30:57.236
is the truth,

30:57.356 --> 30:59.814
which you and he both know
has to come out at some point

30:59.848 --> 31:02.083
because no man can last forever,

31:02.117 --> 31:05.186
and you've done your duty
by lasting this long...

31:07.889 --> 31:09.323
Which he respects.

31:11.693 --> 31:14.695
You're a brave man.
I'll give you that much.

31:14.730 --> 31:16.864
And if there's a machine,

31:16.899 --> 31:18.900
don't waste time trying to game it.

31:28.043 --> 31:30.011
Hot tea.

31:30.045 --> 31:32.113
Make you feel better.

31:34.783 --> 31:35.917
Go ahead.

31:46.471 --> 31:48.322
You military?

31:48.612 --> 31:50.052
Ex.

31:50.966 --> 31:52.065
CIA?

31:54.703 --> 31:55.888
No.

31:56.939 --> 31:58.706
FBI?

31:58.740 --> 32:00.007
No.

32:01.076 --> 32:02.778
Private contractor.

32:03.812 --> 32:05.079
No.

32:08.951 --> 32:10.184
Smoke?

32:10.218 --> 32:11.439
No.

32:16.775 --> 32:18.953
You get a very small window of time

32:19.073 --> 32:21.796
to use the machine to game the man.

32:21.830 --> 32:24.689
You work for the U.S.
Government in any capacity?

32:25.576 --> 32:26.701
No.

32:31.306 --> 32:33.040
Try again.

32:33.075 --> 32:36.110
Do you work for the U.S. Government?

32:38.180 --> 32:39.618
Yes.

32:40.515 --> 32:42.083
Good.

32:42.117 --> 32:44.571
See? Not so hard, is it?

32:45.287 --> 32:46.470
Who?

32:46.590 --> 32:48.990
Just getting you to talk is
his first sign of progress

32:49.024 --> 32:50.758
where others have failed.

32:50.792 --> 32:54.261
Now's when you can start
to steer the interrogation,

32:54.296 --> 32:56.931
'cause his ego wants to allow it.

33:00.636 --> 33:03.170
I've seen some terrible things.

33:03.205 --> 33:04.605
Where?

33:04.640 --> 33:06.841
In the service of my country.

33:06.875 --> 33:09.910
Afghanistan? Iraq? Syria?

33:09.945 --> 33:12.246
Massachusetts.

33:14.549 --> 33:15.816
Massachusetts?

33:15.851 --> 33:18.839
Where my sister was murdered...

33:20.055 --> 33:23.291
By Carlos Mejia...

33:24.793 --> 33:27.341
Using weapons bought...

33:28.063 --> 33:30.297
From Tomas Vitek.

33:30.332 --> 33:32.633
Carlos Mejia?

33:37.072 --> 33:38.606
Do you know him?

33:38.640 --> 33:39.803
No.

33:43.645 --> 33:45.279
That was you on that train.

33:47.916 --> 33:51.018
Maybe I will have that smoke now.

33:54.690 --> 33:58.440
Was Tomas Vitek your
only target in Montreal?

34:04.900 --> 34:07.086
Cigarette, please.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.878
Thank you.

34:37.966 --> 34:39.130
Aah!

34:40.025 --> 34:41.320
Shh.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.340
Get up.

34:57.285 --> 34:59.286
How many more men?

34:59.321 --> 35:00.955
How many more?

35:00.989 --> 35:02.256
Three.

35:03.992 --> 35:06.694
Our orders are to shoot through him.

35:06.728 --> 35:08.696
Those are orders he gave.

35:08.730 --> 35:11.298
You have five seconds
to come out, and...

35:20.475 --> 35:22.910
You can come out now. It's clear.

35:38.693 --> 35:41.662
Now it's time for you to
answer some questions.

35:41.696 --> 35:42.863
Okay.

35:44.080 --> 35:46.427
And we brought you clean underwear.

36:10.332 --> 36:11.687
- Keys.
- What?

36:11.721 --> 36:13.574
- I need your keys.
- Keys?

36:49.973 --> 36:51.244
Yeah, baby.

36:55.199 --> 36:57.066
Do it.

36:57.100 --> 36:59.288
Do it!

37:05.942 --> 37:07.743
You at the border yet?

37:07.777 --> 37:09.011
No, I got robbed.

37:09.045 --> 37:11.580
What do you mean "robbed"?

37:11.615 --> 37:14.831
The took the truck,
everything. It's gone.

37:14.951 --> 37:16.785
Shipment's been hit.

37:16.820 --> 37:19.588
This place is no longer safe.

37:21.625 --> 37:23.071
Clear.

37:55.867 --> 37:57.621
Tear gas!

38:16.680 --> 38:18.814
Now, that's what I call a clean take.

38:20.684 --> 38:22.484
I know you must be worried

38:22.519 --> 38:25.054
the FBI already let Dunne slip
through their fingers once.

38:25.088 --> 38:28.190
I'm not worried, not this time.

38:28.224 --> 38:30.292
I know where you live.

38:38.491 --> 38:40.169
- Let's go.
- Do me a favor.

38:40.203 --> 38:42.237
Throw away the key.

38:46.142 --> 38:47.576
Walk away.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.048
Walk away.

39:21.745 --> 39:22.945
Thank you.

39:24.247 --> 39:25.547
For what?

39:25.582 --> 39:27.216
Coming back for me.

39:27.250 --> 39:28.984
Don't ever do that again.

39:29.019 --> 39:31.220
- Do what?
- Go solo.

39:31.254 --> 39:32.508
Seriously?

39:32.628 --> 39:34.903
We look like we're kidding around?

39:35.023 --> 39:37.547
- You mean when I...
- When you took off in the van

39:37.667 --> 39:38.994
without warning.

39:39.029 --> 39:41.730
To draw fire so you guys could
take Vitek to the safe house.

39:41.765 --> 39:43.565
- On your own.
- There was no time.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.967
To communicate?

39:45.001 --> 39:46.135
We're a team.

39:46.169 --> 39:47.736
You understand what that means?

39:47.771 --> 39:50.072
I thought I was doing what
was best for the team.

39:50.106 --> 39:52.514
You keep pulling stunts like
that, and the time will come

39:52.634 --> 39:55.176
when one or more of us
doesn't make it back.

40:01.284 --> 40:03.318
You think about that.

40:14.064 --> 40:16.265
Feels good to be alive, though...

40:16.299 --> 40:17.833
Huh?

40:20.804 --> 40:22.871
You're welcome, by the way.

40:34.184 --> 40:36.018
So what do you do now, Bryan?

40:36.052 --> 40:38.388
- Marcus.
- Dad.

40:39.856 --> 40:42.925
It's okay, Asha. I can take it.

40:44.394 --> 40:46.295
I work for the Government, sir.

40:46.329 --> 40:47.707
The Government?

40:48.331 --> 40:52.000
But I'm afraid that's
all I can say about it.

40:53.837 --> 40:57.139
I mean, I co... I could
make something up, but...

40:57.173 --> 40:58.841
I'd rather not sit here

40:58.875 --> 41:02.144
and insult your or Mrs.
Flynn's intelligence,

41:02.178 --> 41:03.912
and I'm pretty sure

41:03.947 --> 41:06.604
that between what my sister told you

41:07.160 --> 41:09.218
and now Asha...

41:09.252 --> 41:12.754
That you have a fairly good
idea of the type of work I do.

41:12.789 --> 41:15.324
We're very sorry about
what happened to Cali.

41:15.358 --> 41:17.426
She was like another daughter to us.

41:17.460 --> 41:21.396
Like Asha's become a part
of our family now, too.

41:21.431 --> 41:23.165
Do you believe in what you do, Bryan?

41:23.199 --> 41:24.266
Yes, sir.

41:24.300 --> 41:26.499
And the people who you do it with?

41:29.205 --> 41:30.839
100%.

41:30.874 --> 41:34.009
Can we talk about
something else now, please?

41:34.043 --> 41:35.711
You said you weren't gonna do this.

41:38.281 --> 41:39.849
Thank you...

41:40.442 --> 41:42.293
For your service.

41:43.219 --> 41:44.482
Thank you.
