WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:06.897
Captain's Log,
Stardate 5427 4.7.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.735
Lieutenant Torres has
finally convinced me

00:08.808 --> 00:09.866
that l can't put off

00:09.976 --> 00:12.240
a major maintenance overhaul
any longer.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.177
We've set down on
an uninhabited planet,

00:14.247 --> 00:16.715
and l've sent shuttles
to search for supplies.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.614
What about the
impulse upgrades?

00:18.685 --> 00:19.674
Day after tomorrow.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.618
Put a new phase compensator
on that relay.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.087
Environmental control?

00:23.156 --> 00:25.317
The thermal regulators are
still running a little hot.

00:25.392 --> 00:26.916
Too bad we can't just
keep the windows open.

00:26.993 --> 00:28.585
How long until the warp drive
is back on line?

00:28.661 --> 00:29.593
Six days.

00:29.662 --> 00:31.129
You sure you can't get
it done any faster?

00:31.197 --> 00:33.859
Captain, l don't like sitting
still any more than you do,

00:33.933 --> 00:36.527
but repairs
this extensive take time.

00:38.271 --> 00:39.602
Mendez, track down
that power drain.

00:39.672 --> 00:40.604
Right away.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.163
l know this ship
has been through

00:42.275 --> 00:44.709
a lot, but you told me
this would only take a few days.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.837
That was before l discovered
the microfractures

00:46.913 --> 00:47.902
in the starboard nacelle

00:47.981 --> 00:49.812
and the fused relays
in the main computer.

00:51.084 --> 00:52.278
Who did that?

00:54.187 --> 00:58.146
l noticed a charge imbalance
in the EPS feed.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.714
l'm sorry if l...

00:59.793 --> 01:01.317
lt could have taken us hours
to find that.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.885
l have a tactical
systems report for you.

01:05.031 --> 01:06.555
lt's from
Commander Tuvok.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.692
l'd say you're capable
of a lot more

01:08.802 --> 01:10.463
than delivering padds, lcheb.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.730
l agree.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.898
Until we get underway again,
he's assigned to you.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.305
With him on your team,

01:16.376 --> 01:19.277
maybe you'll get this job done
a little faster.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.856 --> 01:31.483
Neelix?

01:38.531 --> 01:40.658
Rise and shine. lt's 0500.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.257
Already?

01:42.368 --> 01:43.528
Oh!

01:43.636 --> 01:45.866
Oh, l was dreaming
we found the dilithium

01:45.972 --> 01:47.963
and were back aboard Voyager.

01:48.074 --> 01:50.702
Dreaming is
an accurate description.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.109
Didn't we already
scan this nebula?

01:53.179 --> 01:55.545
Four times.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.913
l thought the Borg
were known for being thorough.

01:57.984 --> 02:01.351
The Borg value efficiency,
not redundancy.

02:01.421 --> 02:03.048
l've got a hunch
about this nebula.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.886
There's dilithium
in there somewhere.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.818
l'm getting some fluctuating

02:09.895 --> 02:10.692
energy readings.

02:10.763 --> 02:11.991
From the nebula?

02:12.065 --> 02:13.965
No, it's weapons fire.

04:09.349 --> 04:10.976
Let's get out of here.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.483
We're receiving a distress call.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.383
...have casualties.

04:14.454 --> 04:15.921
Please help us.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.081
We're on a humanitarian mission

04:19.158 --> 04:21.591
delivering medical supplies.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.129
Reverse course.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.599
We can't just leave them.

04:29.702 --> 04:30.896
Starfleet policy.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.870
lnterference in alien conflicts
is strictly prohibited.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.067
You heard their Captain.
lt's a medical ship.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.142
Their shields are down.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.236
Life support is failing
on at least three decks.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.746
Open a channel
to the other ship.

04:45.718 --> 04:48.516
This is Ensign Kim
of the Delta Flyer.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.681
l don't know what
you're fighting about,

04:50.757 --> 04:52.315
but it looks like you've won.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.952
The people on the other ship
have casualties. We'd like to...

04:55.061 --> 04:56.050
This isn't your concern.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.063
l'm not taking sides.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.758
l only want to
help the wounded.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.258
Withdraw immediately.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.234
They're charging weapons.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.830
Neelix, set our deflector beam

05:07.940 --> 05:09.737
for a narrow pulse.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.037
Seven, let me know

05:11.110 --> 05:13.408
the second their weapons array
is fully charged.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.310
l might be able
to trigger an overload.

05:15.381 --> 05:17.679
The deflector bandwidth
is at .4 microns.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.217
Now.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.288
Their weapons are off-line.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.383
Shields are down.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.895
They're retreating.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.190
Take the helm.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.857
Neelix, you're with me.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.027
Who's in charge here?

06:06.099 --> 06:07.566
He is.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.260
What are we going to do?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.337
lt's okay.
We're here to help.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.803
The ship that attacked
you is gone.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.340
Who are you?

06:15.441 --> 06:17.306
Harry Kim from
the Starship Voyager.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.470
We're responding
to your distress call.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.137
We can treat

06:21.214 --> 06:22.545
your wounded.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.886
The Captain?

06:27.987 --> 06:29.011
Dead, sir.

06:29.088 --> 06:31.181
So are the rest
of the officers.

06:31.257 --> 06:35.250
l'm reading a total of 27
life-forms aboard the ship.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.420
There were 56 of us.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.054
How are we going to get home

06:38.131 --> 06:39.325
without the officers?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.128
We need to restore main power.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.792
Where's the warp interface?

06:42.902 --> 06:45.097
We're passengers, not crewmen.

06:45.204 --> 06:48.105
You can access
engineering systems from here.

06:56.783 --> 07:00.275
Your warp core's intact.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.514
l think l can bring it
back on line.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.556
Can you monitor
antimatter flow?

07:04.624 --> 07:06.615
l'm not sure. l...

07:06.692 --> 07:08.319
Just watch this readout,

07:08.394 --> 07:09.554
and tell me

07:09.629 --> 07:11.654
if it starts to fluctuate.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.171
l'm routing emergency power
to structural

07:23.242 --> 07:24.539
integrity.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.044
Atmospheric pressure
is returning to normal.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.881
Neelix, we'll go through
the ship deck by deck--

07:31.951 --> 07:33.441
find the survivors.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.783
We need to get our cloak
back on line.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.289
l'll take a look at it as soon
as l've repaired the engines.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.348
No. The cloak is more important.

07:40.426 --> 07:43.327
The Annari have far more
powerful weapons than we do.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.328
lf they come back,

07:44.397 --> 07:46.058
the cloak is our best defense.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.100
We'll try to get it
back on line.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.634
Kim to Delta Flyer.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.039
Go ahead.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.098
l need your help, Seven.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.270
lt looks like we're going
to be here for awhile.

08:03.282 --> 08:04.647
How did you do it?

08:04.717 --> 08:05.911
Do what?

08:05.985 --> 08:08.545
Disable the Annari warship
so quickly?

08:08.621 --> 08:09.952
Uh, basically, we used

08:10.022 --> 08:11.819
their own weapons against them.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.482
How?

08:13.559 --> 08:15.789
We used a deflector pulse

08:15.862 --> 08:17.762
to overload their phaser banks.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.702
You know a lot
about engineering.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.738
lt's all part
of my Starfleet training.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.068
Starfleet?

08:28.140 --> 08:29.767
Yeah. The organization
l work for.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.776
And they teach you
all these things?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.072
We train at an academy,

08:33.145 --> 08:35.739
and l guess l've picked up
a few new tricks

08:35.815 --> 08:37.442
during my time on Voyager.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.280
How long have you been Captain?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.851
l'm just an Ensign.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.549
Ensign? E... What's that?

08:44.624 --> 08:46.387
A junior officer.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.951
The lowest ranked officer,
actually.

08:52.298 --> 08:55.461
This is my first
deep space assignment.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.627
lt hasn't gone very well.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.368
Could you hand me that?

09:03.609 --> 09:06.407
My first week on the job
didn't go very well, either.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.811
We ended up 70,000

09:08.915 --> 09:10.246
light-years from home,

09:10.316 --> 09:12.807
lost over a dozen crew members,

09:12.885 --> 09:16.514
but l got through it,
and so will you.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.589
l hope so.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.493
lf you're going to be
a starship officer,

09:23.563 --> 09:27.522
you've got to accept that
adversity comes with the job.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.881
What's that?

09:43.015 --> 09:44.004
lt's a diagnostic

09:44.083 --> 09:45.744
of the antimatter injectors.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.082
No, l meant that
stuff you're eating.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.849
Nutritional supplements,

09:49.922 --> 09:52.618
replicated to meet
my metabolic requirements.

09:52.692 --> 09:53.886
Sounds delicious.

09:54.026 --> 09:57.484
You know, in the Mess Hall,

09:57.563 --> 10:01.522
they actually have
tables and chairs for that.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.192
l prefer to work while l eat.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.395
lt's a more efficient
use of my time.

10:07.873 --> 10:10.398
You did a great job today.

10:10.509 --> 10:13.808
We're ahead of schedule
thanks to you.

10:13.879 --> 10:17.838
Here's what we're going
to work on tomorrow.

10:19.418 --> 10:22.649
l'll see you at 0600.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.128
lcheb.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.493
Yes?

10:31.564 --> 10:33.225
What do you do for fun?

10:33.299 --> 10:34.926
Fun?

10:35.034 --> 10:36.262
Recreation.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.428
How do you spend your time
when you're off duty?

10:38.537 --> 10:40.437
Between my work and my studies,

10:40.506 --> 10:42.872
l don't have much time
for recreation.

10:42.942 --> 10:46.571
l've learned that you've got
to take a break once in awhile.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.944
l've been doing a lot
of rock climbing

10:49.015 --> 10:50.846
on the holodeck.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.213
Maybe when we're finished

10:52.284 --> 10:54.013
tightening all
the nuts and bolts,

10:54.086 --> 10:55.246
you'd like to join me.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.620
l do have an interest
in geology.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.955
lt's not about the rocks, lcheb.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.925
lt's about the climbing.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.997
Main power has been restored.

11:13.105 --> 11:14.936
All stations responding.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.373
The cloak's back on line.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.241
lmpulse and warp drives
are standing by.

11:20.312 --> 11:22.872
Shields are at 96 percent.

11:22.948 --> 11:24.939
l'd say you're ready
to get back on course.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.109
We appreciate your help.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.618
l hope you have
a safe journey.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.881
Mr. Kim...

11:28.954 --> 11:31.946
l feel guilty
asking even more of you,

11:32.024 --> 11:35.721
but no one on this ship
knows how to fly it.

11:35.795 --> 11:40.494
None of you has ever piloted
a starship?

11:40.566 --> 11:42.557
l've trained in shuttles,

11:42.668 --> 11:44.499
but nothing like this.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.798
l'll enter a flight plan
in the auto-navigation system

11:49.909 --> 11:52.605
and give you a quick course
in helm operations.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.475
You shouldn't have any trouble.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.536
Couldn't you take us?

11:55.614 --> 11:56.911
This ship needs

11:56.982 --> 11:59.177
an experienced
commanding officer.

11:59.251 --> 12:01.583
l'm sorry, but we've already
gotten more involved

12:01.654 --> 12:02.586
than we should have,

12:02.655 --> 12:04.213
and they need us
back on Voyager.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.155
lt's not just my ship
that concerns me.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.455
You've made an enemy
of the Annari now,

12:08.527 --> 12:11.052
but if you dock your ship
in our Shuttle Bay,

12:11.130 --> 12:12.597
our cloak will protect you.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.498
That's a generous offer,
but we'll be fine.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.229
Please, Mr. Kim,
we can't afford to fail.

12:18.337 --> 12:19.804
This ship is...

12:19.905 --> 12:21.770
Loken, don't.

12:21.841 --> 12:24.776
We can trust these people.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.210
l'm a doctor.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.839
These people are
my research team.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.543
We're carrying new vaccines
to our homeland.

12:32.618 --> 12:34.518
They'll save thousands
of lives.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.488
Sir, l looked at
their flight plan.

12:37.556 --> 12:41.117
lt takes them pretty
close to Voyager.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.820
l'll bring you
as far as our ship.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.126
When we get there,

12:47.199 --> 12:50.657
you can discuss your situation
with my Captain.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.431
Thank you.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.506
What about Starfleet policy?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.871
This is a
humanitarian mission.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.036
Dock the Flyer
in their Shuttle Bay.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.581
We're approaching the planet.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.419
Take us out of warp.

13:12.491 --> 13:14.015
Disengage the cloak.

13:14.093 --> 13:15.424
Wait.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.759
l'm detecting three
alien vessels in orbit.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.025
On screen.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.393
Those are Annari warships.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.164
Your people are in danger.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.211
l apologize
for the state of my ship.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.720
We weren't
expecting company.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.085
l hope we're not imposing.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.088
Not at all.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.488
Making contact
with new cultures

13:46.559 --> 13:47.753
is a priority for us.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.454
For us, too.

13:49.528 --> 13:50.961
This is a fine ship, Captain.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.725
One of the best in the fleet,

13:52.798 --> 13:54.356
but it could use a new set

13:54.433 --> 13:56.060
of deuterium injectors.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.659
Any chance you
could provide them?

13:58.771 --> 14:01.137
l think
we can arrange something.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.799
What are you offering
in exchange?

14:02.908 --> 14:04.034
Zeolitic ore.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.703
We mined several tons of it
from an asteroid field.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.371
lt's high-grade,
easy to refine.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.074
l'll speak
to my supply officer.

14:11.283 --> 14:12.341
We're being hailed

14:12.418 --> 14:14.215
by Ensign Kim, audio only.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.753
Hello, Harry.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.311
ls everything all right?

14:17.389 --> 14:18.788
Of course.
Why wouldn't it be?

14:18.858 --> 14:22.225
Our long-range scans
detected several alien ships

14:22.294 --> 14:23.386
orbiting the planet.

14:23.462 --> 14:24.895
l appreciate your concern,

14:24.964 --> 14:26.329
but there's nothing
to worry about.

14:26.398 --> 14:27.990
We've made some new friends,
that's all.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.159
When can we expect you back?

14:29.268 --> 14:31.361
We've run into a slight delay.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.062
Nothing serious, l hope.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.140
No. Everything's under control.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.401
Good.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.136
Any luck finding dilithium?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.643
Uh, l'm afraid not.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.612
l'll tell the other teams
to keep looking.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.612
See you soon, Ensign.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.205
Yes, ma'am. Kim out.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.682
Dilithium...

14:45.751 --> 14:47.412
We can get that for you, too.

14:47.486 --> 14:48.919
Really?

14:49.955 --> 14:52.947
She's formed an alliance
with our enemy.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.525
Just because they're talking

14:54.593 --> 14:56.220
doesn't mean
they formed an alliance.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.354
lt's probably just
a friendly meeting.

14:58.430 --> 14:59.988
That's how the Annari operate.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.293
They come to you as friends,

15:01.367 --> 15:02.800
and when they've won your trust,

15:02.902 --> 15:06.394
they declare you subjects
of the Annari Empire.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.477
Kim to Voyager.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.307
We didn't expect you so soon.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.405
Actually, Captain,
l'm closer than l let on.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.609
and l've brought
some new friends of my own.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.712
Our chances of getting home
without your help

15:23.789 --> 15:25.620
aren't very good.

15:25.691 --> 15:28.421
We'd appreciate any assistance
you could offer.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.428
l hope you understand.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.623
l need to give this
some thought.

15:43.976 --> 15:47.412
You've put me in
a difficult position, Ensign.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.709
We could use the help
the Annari are offering,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.943
but if they find out
we're aiding their enemy...

15:52.051 --> 15:53.746
l couldn't just stand
by and do nothing.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.252
That doesn't justify

15:55.321 --> 15:57.289
getting involved
in somebody else's fight.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.620
What would you have done?

15:59.692 --> 16:01.557
Probably exactly what you did.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.628
l guess l learned from the best.

16:03.662 --> 16:06.324
lf this were simply an errand
of mercy, l wouldn't hesitate.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.332
But the fact is,
these people are involved

16:08.400 --> 16:10.368
in an interplanetary war.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.199
Captain,
l've gotten to know them

16:12.304 --> 16:13.828
over the last couple of days.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.598
You met Loken.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.767
They're scientists,
not soldiers.

16:17.876 --> 16:19.844
You've only heard
one side of the story.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.504
You've taken sides before.

16:21.580 --> 16:22.672
The Borg resistance,

16:22.748 --> 16:23.544
the Vaadwaur...

16:23.615 --> 16:25.446
Those were
different circumstances.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.144
You were trying
to help people in need.

16:27.219 --> 16:29.278
How is this any different?

16:29.355 --> 16:30.720
Have you thought about applying

16:30.789 --> 16:32.222
to the Advocate General's
office?

16:32.291 --> 16:33.883
You'd make a good lawyer.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.690
l suppose l could spare

16:37.763 --> 16:39.390
Chakotay or Tuvok
for a few days.

16:39.465 --> 16:41.092
That won't be necessary.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.629
The Kraylor know me.

16:44.737 --> 16:45.897
They trust me.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.939
l'm sure they'd find Tuvok
or Chakotay

16:48.007 --> 16:49.474
just as trustworthy.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.237
But they outrank me.

16:52.311 --> 16:55.280
lf you send one of them,
it won't be my mission anymore.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.338
Your mission.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.441
My first real command.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.383
You've been in command
on Voyager before.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.648
On the night shift,
for a few hours...

17:03.689 --> 17:05.316
lt's not the same thing.

17:05.391 --> 17:08.087
You and Chakotay are
always a couple of decks away,

17:08.160 --> 17:10.492
ready to take over if
anything goes wrong.

17:10.561 --> 17:12.791
l've been on Voyager
for almost seven years,

17:12.865 --> 17:14.388
and l'm still an Ensign.

17:14.465 --> 17:17.333
lf this is your way
of bucking for a promotion...

17:17.435 --> 17:20.666
No, no, l understand
there's a command structure

17:20.772 --> 17:23.241
and that our circumstances
are unique.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.776
But the fact is,
if we were back home,

17:25.877 --> 17:27.573
l'd be a Lieutenant by now,

17:27.646 --> 17:29.876
maybe even
a Lieutenant Commander.

17:30.015 --> 17:33.109
You're pretty sure
of yourself, aren't you?

17:33.185 --> 17:34.982
l know l can do this,

17:35.054 --> 17:37.750
and the Kraylor are giving me
a chance to prove it.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.023
l expect you back before
we complete our repairs.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.426
Yes, ma'am.

17:44.496 --> 17:45.428
And l'm not

17:45.497 --> 17:46.429
sending you alone.

17:46.498 --> 17:47.430
Captain.

17:47.499 --> 17:49.330
l want you
to take Seven.

17:49.435 --> 17:53.030
Since she has no rank,
you clearly outrank her.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.973
Lieutenant Torres asked me

18:03.048 --> 18:05.278
to repair a malfunctioning
holo-emitter.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.181
lt's about time.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.379
Whenever l move
to the far corner

18:09.455 --> 18:12.049
of the Surgical Bay,
my legs disappear.

18:16.195 --> 18:20.291
Seven of Nine told me
you gave her social lessons.

18:20.365 --> 18:23.391
Hm. She wanted to get along
better with the crew.

18:23.502 --> 18:27.268
Social skills are one thing
the Borg never assimilated.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.307
l was hoping
you could instruct me, as well.

18:29.374 --> 18:30.306
l'd be delighted.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.842
Lesson One: ''Making
a First lmpression.''

18:31.977 --> 18:33.137
Actually...

18:33.212 --> 18:35.271
l wanted to ask you
about something specific.

18:35.347 --> 18:36.974
Fire away.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.540
How can you tell
when someone has...

18:39.618 --> 18:42.519
romantic feelings for you?

18:42.588 --> 18:44.715
lcheb, this is a surprise.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.190
Have you caught someone's eye?

18:47.259 --> 18:50.524
l'm speaking hypothetically.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.257
Ah.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.296
Hypothetically,

18:55.367 --> 18:57.358
there are various indications

18:57.436 --> 18:58.994
of romantic attraction.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.662
Compliments, for example,

19:00.772 --> 19:03.673
invitations to
social activities,

19:03.742 --> 19:07.178
finding excuses to be in close
proximity with someone.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.214
Yes, but couldn't
those things happen

19:09.281 --> 19:11.408
in a relationship
that wasn't romantic?

19:11.483 --> 19:12.711
l suppose.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.082
ls there a way
to be absolutely certain?

19:15.154 --> 19:18.248
Well, short of an open
declaration of affection,

19:18.323 --> 19:20.223
there are some
fairly reliable

19:20.292 --> 19:21.816
physiological responses:

19:21.927 --> 19:24.122
elevated blood pressure,
increased

19:24.196 --> 19:25.993
beta-endorphin production...

19:26.064 --> 19:28.999
Thank you, Doctor.
You've been very helpful.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.592
With my guidance, you
will master the nuances

19:31.703 --> 19:33.671
of social interaction
in no time!

19:36.008 --> 19:37.873
Harry!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.375
Take me with you, buddy.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.139
Sorry, Tom. This is my mission.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.875
Oh, come on, l've been itching
to get back into space

19:44.016 --> 19:46.143
ever since we set down
on this dust bowl.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.776
l'm tired of cleaning conduits

19:47.853 --> 19:48.979
and replacing relays.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.078
You're a married man now.

19:50.155 --> 19:51.645
You've got family
responsibilities.

19:51.723 --> 19:52.849
Just leave the away missions

19:52.925 --> 19:54.187
to the young,
unattached guys.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.624
That ship is in
pretty bad shape.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.127
You're going to
need a good pilot.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.561
No, thanks.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.564
Wait a minute...

20:00.632 --> 20:02.827
l know what
this is about.

20:02.935 --> 20:03.833
You do?

20:03.936 --> 20:05.801
Sure. You've got a girl
on that ship

20:05.871 --> 20:07.566
you don't want me
to know about.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.603
There's no girl. Not this time.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.008
Then what is it?

20:14.213 --> 20:15.737
l don't know how else
to this say this,

20:15.814 --> 20:16.746
so l'll just say it.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.282
You've always been
Captain Proton.

20:18.350 --> 20:21.183
l have always
been Buster Kincaid.

20:21.253 --> 20:22.777
lt's my turn this time.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.530
l'm glad you're not
planning to leave

20:38.637 --> 20:40.332
on an empty
stomach, ''Captain.''

20:40.439 --> 20:41.963
l have...

20:42.074 --> 20:43.974
plomeek soup
and eggplant parmesan.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.270
Either's fine.

20:45.344 --> 20:46.276
Wrong answer.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.312
Excuse me?

20:47.412 --> 20:49.107
lf you're going
to be a Captain,

20:49.181 --> 20:50.910
you have to act like a Captain.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.474
Never admit you're
uncertain about anything.

20:53.552 --> 20:56.112
You can't be indecisive
in front of your crew.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.520
lt's just a snack, Neelix.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.717
When Captain Janeway
comes in here,

21:00.792 --> 21:02.885
she knows exactly
what she wants.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.258
Maybe l'm just not as picky
about my food.

21:05.330 --> 21:09.494
Whatever you say... Ensign.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.795
Neelix.

21:12.337 --> 21:15.636
Plomeek soup,
and make sure it's hot.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.717
Captain on the Bridge.

21:27.252 --> 21:28.651
Where did you learn that?

21:28.720 --> 21:29.652
l've been studying

21:29.721 --> 21:31.450
that Starfleet manual
you loaned me.

21:31.523 --> 21:33.047
Take your station, Mr. Terek.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.252
Aye, sir.

21:35.327 --> 21:36.453
Course?

21:36.528 --> 21:38.257
l'll do it.

21:38.330 --> 21:42.391
Laying in a course,
heading 1 15 mark 37.

21:43.835 --> 21:45.769
Does this ship
have a name?

21:45.837 --> 21:48.704
Medical Transport 136.

21:48.774 --> 21:51.106
l think we can do
better than that.

21:55.013 --> 21:57.481
Nightingale.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.517
The name of someone
from my homeworld.

21:59.584 --> 22:00.881
She was famous for treating

22:00.986 --> 22:03.819
wounded soldiers
on the battlefield.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.482
lt's perfect.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.821
Hail Voyager.

22:09.461 --> 22:10.689
Kim to Voyager.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.229
We're ready to get underway.

22:12.297 --> 22:14.788
Acknowledged. Good luck.

22:14.866 --> 22:16.060
See you in a few days.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.066
Kim out.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.295
Main power.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.132
-On line.
-Tactical.

22:20.238 --> 22:23.105
Shields and weapons standing by.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.235
Bring the cloak on line.

22:26.311 --> 22:28.279
Warp 6.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.050
Engage.

22:41.426 --> 22:46.193
Acting Captain's Personal Log,
Stardate 54277.3.

22:46.264 --> 22:48.357
My first day in command
has been challenging,

22:48.433 --> 22:50.526
but l've loved
every minute of it.

22:50.635 --> 22:53.627
l can't help feeling that this
was something l was born to do.

22:53.739 --> 22:57.766
The hourly status report
you requested.

22:57.876 --> 22:58.934
Thanks.

22:59.010 --> 23:02.377
Why have you brought
these items aboard?

23:02.481 --> 23:04.642
They make me
feel more at home.

23:04.683 --> 23:07.277
We'll only be on this
vessel for a few days.

23:07.352 --> 23:09.843
Decorating is an inefficient
use of your time.

23:09.921 --> 23:12.617
lt's important to forge
a personal connection

23:12.691 --> 23:15.159
with your vessel;
make the ship your own.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.455
Ask Captain Janeway.

23:16.528 --> 23:20.157
l'll discuss it with her
the moment we return.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.157
ls there anything else?

23:23.268 --> 23:25.202
l asked Terek
to make a course correction.

23:25.270 --> 23:26.897
He's never done that before.

23:27.038 --> 23:28.471
l'd better check on him.

23:28.540 --> 23:31.304
l believe he's capable
of doing it himself.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.279
Status?

23:40.352 --> 23:41.944
l've entered the new heading.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.578
Looks like the guidance vector

23:43.655 --> 23:45.282
is off by a couple of microns.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.291
l was about to correct that.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.519
You need to realign

23:48.593 --> 23:50.959
the primary
navigational sensor first.

23:51.029 --> 23:52.326
Yes, sir.

23:53.298 --> 23:54.959
And make sure
it stays locked

23:55.066 --> 23:56.192
on your guide star.

23:56.301 --> 23:57.598
Here, let me show you.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.348
l'm-l'm sorry, Lieutenant.

24:12.417 --> 24:13.714
Don't worry about it.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.878
Bumping elbows
comes with the job,

24:15.954 --> 24:18.149
and you can
call me B'Elanna.

24:18.223 --> 24:20.248
Put this with the others.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.495
These relays should have been
replaced a while ago.

24:26.565 --> 24:28.726
lt's amazing
they've held up this long.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.563
l am really
looking forward

24:30.669 --> 24:32.899
to our climb.

24:33.004 --> 24:33.936
Wouldn't you prefer

24:34.039 --> 24:36.303
to spend your free time
with your husband?

24:38.009 --> 24:40.671
lf it doesn't involve
a race car, a shuttle,

24:40.745 --> 24:44.044
or something else he can drive,
Tom's not interested.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.776
Besides, since we got married,

24:45.851 --> 24:47.614
l see more
than enough of him.

24:47.686 --> 24:48.983
Hold still.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.525
What's that?

25:02.601 --> 25:03.693
l'm reading a power fluctuation

25:03.802 --> 25:04.996
somewhere
in the propulsion system.

25:05.103 --> 25:06.331
lt's destabilizing the cloak.

25:06.438 --> 25:07.405
All stop.

25:17.282 --> 25:18.715
Core is stable.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.876
That should take
care of it.

25:20.952 --> 25:22.647
Are you absolutely certain?

25:22.721 --> 25:24.689
As a scientist,
you should know

25:24.756 --> 25:27.623
there's no such thing
as absolute certainty.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.557
Perhaps we could run
a diagnostic before we...

25:29.628 --> 25:30.720
That would take hours.

25:30.795 --> 25:32.490
Captain Janeway
wants us back

25:32.564 --> 25:34.225
before Voyager
finishes its overhaul.

25:34.299 --> 25:35.698
The cloaking system
is delicate.

25:35.767 --> 25:37.166
lt requires
constant attention.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.236
Correct me if l'm wrong,

25:38.336 --> 25:39.462
you're a physician.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.737
You have to trust me on this.

25:42.807 --> 25:45.275
We'll monitor it closely.
Don't worry.

25:45.343 --> 25:47.140
l simply want to ensure

25:47.212 --> 25:49.646
that our mission is a success.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.376
You asked me
to take command of this ship,

25:52.450 --> 25:54.179
and that's what l'm doing.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.027
Tell Terek to resume course.

26:08.199 --> 26:10.190
l've discovered a serious flaw

26:10.302 --> 26:12.202
in one of the ship's systems.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.237
Which one?

26:13.338 --> 26:14.464
The Captain.

26:16.541 --> 26:17.803
The Captain's main function

26:17.876 --> 26:19.343
is to issue orders, correct?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.174
-Right.
-And the crew's function

26:21.246 --> 26:23.840
is to support the Captain
and carry out those orders.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.576
What's your point?

26:25.650 --> 26:28.050
Every time you give an order,
you carry it out yourself.

26:28.119 --> 26:29.882
And when someone else
makes a suggestion,

26:29.955 --> 26:31.013
you dismiss it.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.114
These people are inexperienced.

26:33.191 --> 26:34.419
They need my help.

26:34.492 --> 26:36.460
When you first came
aboard Voyager,

26:36.528 --> 26:38.291
did Captain Janeway help you?

26:38.363 --> 26:41.423
Sure. She looked after
all the junior officers.

26:41.499 --> 26:42.989
By doing your work for you?

26:43.101 --> 26:44.534
No. She gave me a lot to do,
actually.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.592
Because she felt

26:45.704 --> 26:47.899
you were more capable
than she was?

26:48.073 --> 26:49.631
Of course not.

26:49.741 --> 26:54.735
She wanted me to learn,
to gain confidence.

26:54.813 --> 26:56.110
lnteresting.

27:06.691 --> 27:07.817
Emergency power.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.689
Repolarize
the containment field.

27:09.761 --> 27:10.819
l can't.

27:10.895 --> 27:12.157
The cloak is going
to fail again.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.822
Don't panic.
This is a minor malfunction.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.627
Minor? We're losing
our main defense system.

27:16.701 --> 27:19.169
We've been detected.

27:19.270 --> 27:22.068
Two Annari vessels are
closing on our position.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.768
Correction--
six Annari vessels.

27:32.617 --> 27:33.777
Evasive maneuvers!

27:34.953 --> 27:36.477
Kim to Engineering.

27:36.554 --> 27:39.022
Go ahead.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.717
We need that cloak
back on line.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.022
The primary generator
has failed.

27:43.094 --> 27:44.186
l'm trying to...

27:46.297 --> 27:48.231
Seven?

27:48.299 --> 27:49.994
Seven, come in.

27:50.101 --> 27:52.365
You have the Bridge.

27:52.470 --> 27:53.562
We need you here.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.730
l'll go, sir.

27:56.608 --> 27:59.270
All right. l'll give you
instructions over the com.

28:00.645 --> 28:01.805
Charge phaser banks.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.472
Target their weapons array.

28:03.548 --> 28:04.640
Which ship?

28:04.716 --> 28:08.174
The closest one,
off our port bow.

28:19.064 --> 28:20.497
Dayla to the Bridge.

28:20.565 --> 28:22.362
Life support's failing
down here.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.834
l've gotten everyone out.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.028
Good work.

28:26.137 --> 28:28.105
Now go
to the cloaking generator.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.833
What's the field polarity?

28:29.941 --> 28:30.999
206.4.

28:31.109 --> 28:32.201
That's too low.

28:32.277 --> 28:33.869
We're going to have to raise it.

28:33.945 --> 28:35.606
l'm bypassing
the phase converter.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.875
Wait. l didn't tell you
to do that.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.075
Won't that increase
the field polarity?

28:40.151 --> 28:41.243
Yes, but...

28:42.454 --> 28:44.183
Listen to me carefully.

28:44.255 --> 28:45.779
l want you to try...

28:45.857 --> 28:47.222
Dayla, it's Loken.

28:47.292 --> 28:48.316
Take the warp core off-line.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.054
What are you talking about?

28:50.128 --> 28:52.619
Bypass the driver coil
and shunt power directly

28:52.697 --> 28:54.426
to the polaron matrix.

29:03.975 --> 29:05.636
The cloak is back on line.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.075
Get us out of here,
full impulse.

29:07.145 --> 29:08.806
Dayla, secure

29:08.880 --> 29:10.006
the Engineering section

29:10.081 --> 29:11.412
and get back to the Bridge.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.311
Dayla!

29:17.655 --> 29:20.089
l'm not reading
any life signs in Engineering.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.159
Dayla?

29:33.271 --> 29:34.761
She's dead.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.773
How's Seven?

29:36.841 --> 29:38.706
She may be in shock.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.870
l'm not sure.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.571
Have a look.

29:51.923 --> 29:54.585
Your opinion, Doctor?

29:54.659 --> 29:58.117
l believe
she may be in shock.

29:58.196 --> 29:59.322
Do you think
we should give her

29:59.397 --> 30:00.329
a cortical stimulant?

30:00.398 --> 30:02.628
That might be indicated.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.561
You are no doctor, are you?

30:09.207 --> 30:10.674
You and l need to talk...

30:10.742 --> 30:12.107
alone.

30:20.852 --> 30:22.786
What the hell is going on?

30:22.854 --> 30:24.549
l don't know what you mean.

30:24.622 --> 30:27.113
Nothing about this
mission is adding up.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.183
lt's obvious you
know a lot more

30:29.260 --> 30:31.524
about cloaking systems
than biology.

30:31.596 --> 30:32.688
So did Dayla.

30:32.764 --> 30:33.696
And the second

30:33.765 --> 30:34.857
our cloak failed,

30:34.933 --> 30:38.164
half a dozen Annari warships
came after us--

30:38.269 --> 30:41.705
one little medical transport.

30:41.806 --> 30:43.398
The truth!

30:46.211 --> 30:49.908
My colleagues and l have
been working at a secret base

30:49.981 --> 30:51.846
but not to create vaccines.

30:51.916 --> 30:55.352
We've been developing
cloaking devices for our fleet.

30:55.420 --> 30:56.944
This ship is a prototype.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.955
The Annari know we have it,

30:59.023 --> 31:00.650
and they don't want
us to get it home.

31:00.758 --> 31:02.419
l never would
have agreed to this

31:02.460 --> 31:04.792
if l had known you had
a military objective.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.697
Our world has been under an
Annari blockade for three years.

31:08.766 --> 31:11.462
The planet is protected
by a shield grid,

31:11.569 --> 31:15.232
but it's almost impossible
to get our ships in or out.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.275
l convinced Captain Janeway
this was a humanitarian mission.

31:18.343 --> 31:19.571
lt is.

31:19.644 --> 31:24.047
The Annari are choking us
to death slowly.

31:24.115 --> 31:27.243
lf we can't get supply ships
through the blockade,

31:27.318 --> 31:30.082
we can't get food
to our people...

31:30.154 --> 31:31.644
or medicine.

31:31.723 --> 31:36.683
For all l know,
that's another lie.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.125
Reverse course.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.167
Sir?

31:45.236 --> 31:46.760
We're heading back to Voyager.

31:46.871 --> 31:47.929
l don't understand.

31:48.039 --> 31:50.234
He knows about the cloak.

31:50.308 --> 31:52.003
l would've told you...

31:52.110 --> 31:53.008
l gave you an order.

31:53.144 --> 31:54.008
What about the mission?

31:54.145 --> 31:55.009
That's not your concern.

31:55.146 --> 31:56.113
You want to be
a starship officer?

31:56.180 --> 31:57.169
Your job

31:57.248 --> 31:58.715
-is to follow orders.
-Sir, l don't think you...

31:58.783 --> 32:00.273
This is not a debate.

32:00.385 --> 32:02.512
You're under my command.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.018
No, sir.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.686
Not anymore.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.128
You're relieved.

32:13.197 --> 32:15.188
You, take the helm.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.497
l believe you're the one
who's been relieved.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.641
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

32:28.713 --> 32:31.477
Engineering,
to assist B'Elanna...

32:31.549 --> 32:33.039
Lieutenant Torres.

32:33.117 --> 32:35.551
Well, you've been seeing
a lot of my wife lately.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.951
Should l be worried?

32:37.088 --> 32:38.680
Mm, the repairs
are extensive.

32:38.756 --> 32:39.848
lt's a lot of work.

32:39.924 --> 32:41.084
You can't fool me.

32:41.159 --> 32:44.219
l heard you two were planning
on scaling some cliffs together.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.557
lt was her idea.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.722
Hey, relax.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.062
Spending time on the holodeck
is good for you,

32:49.133 --> 32:51.761
but if you really want
to have fun, forget climbing.

32:51.869 --> 32:53.496
Try my race car program.

32:53.604 --> 32:54.662
''Race car''?

32:54.772 --> 32:56.603
You get to chase me
around a track

32:56.674 --> 32:58.301
in an old Earth
ground vehicle.

32:58.376 --> 32:59.809
300 kph.

32:59.877 --> 33:01.845
lt'll really get
your blood pumping.

33:01.946 --> 33:04.278
Are you challenging
me to a competition?

33:04.315 --> 33:06.408
Well, you think
you can take me?

33:06.484 --> 33:09.317
Tomorrow, Holodeck 2,
1900 hours.

33:24.402 --> 33:26.893
There is something
we need to discuss.

33:27.071 --> 33:29.699
Sure, as soon as you help me
finish this diagnostic.

33:29.807 --> 33:30.739
l can't do this.

33:30.808 --> 33:31.740
Of course you can.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.071
You've done
dozens of them.

33:33.144 --> 33:35.078
l'm not talking
about the diagnostic.

33:35.146 --> 33:36.579
l'm talking about us.

33:36.647 --> 33:37.739
''Us''?

33:37.815 --> 33:40.750
Your interest in me--
it's inappropriate.

33:40.818 --> 33:42.809
l don't think l understand.

33:42.887 --> 33:45.754
lt's obvious you desire
a romantic involvement.

33:45.823 --> 33:47.085
Excuse me?

33:47.158 --> 33:49.149
You've made all the
customary overtures--

33:49.227 --> 33:51.627
finding reasons to
spend time with me,

33:51.696 --> 33:52.720
complimenting me,

33:52.797 --> 33:55.960
inviting me to engage in
recreational activities.

33:56.100 --> 33:58.091
Your husband
even challenged me

33:58.202 --> 33:59.396
to a ritual contest.

33:59.504 --> 34:01.096
What are you talking about?

34:01.205 --> 34:02.229
According to my research,

34:02.340 --> 34:03.830
it's a traditional
Klingon practice.

34:04.008 --> 34:07.876
Look... l'm sorry,
but you've got the wrong idea.

34:07.979 --> 34:10.072
You seemed a little lonely.

34:10.148 --> 34:12.241
l was just trying
to be friendly.

34:12.315 --> 34:13.373
l scanned you.

34:13.451 --> 34:14.440
You scanned me?

34:14.518 --> 34:15.781
ln the Jefferies tube.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.447
Your blood pressure
and neurotransmitter readings

34:18.523 --> 34:20.047
indicated a state of arousal.

34:20.123 --> 34:23.491
lt was hot, and l've been
under a lot of pressure,

34:23.561 --> 34:25.859
but l certainly wasn't aroused.

34:28.099 --> 34:30.192
Look, lcheb, l like you...

34:30.301 --> 34:35.466
but aside from the fact
that l am a much older woman,

34:35.572 --> 34:36.835
l'm married.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.467
That's why we have to do
the honorable thing.

34:40.777 --> 34:42.643
We should stop seeing
each other.

34:46.650 --> 34:49.380
You're right.

34:49.454 --> 34:51.319
As much as it hurts,

34:51.389 --> 34:54.324
l'll just have
to face the truth.

34:54.391 --> 34:56.223
lt's for the best.

34:56.293 --> 34:57.591
Mm.

35:11.909 --> 35:13.877
Seven?

35:15.913 --> 35:17.847
Feeling better?

35:17.915 --> 35:19.849
Well enough to return to duty.

35:19.917 --> 35:22.351
You won't be returning to duty,

35:22.420 --> 35:24.684
not on this ship anyway.

35:24.755 --> 35:26.848
Loken lied to us.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.585
There's no vaccine.

35:28.659 --> 35:30.889
The cloak is the real cargo.

35:30.995 --> 35:33.896
l ordered the crew
to take us back to Voyager,

35:33.998 --> 35:35.465
but they refused.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.024
They mutinied.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.696
l guess that's what
you'd call it.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.864
l've packed some supplies.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.441
We'll take an escape pod.

35:44.509 --> 35:46.841
l'm hoping the Annari
will leave us alone,

35:46.911 --> 35:48.435
treat us as neutral parties.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.674
We're not ''neutral parties.''

35:50.748 --> 35:52.909
This is a military mission.
We can't get involved.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.246
We've been ''involved''

35:54.318 --> 35:56.343
since you first fired
on that Annari ship.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.786
l thought l was helping people
in distress.

35:58.856 --> 36:00.983
Don't they still need your help?

36:01.092 --> 36:02.582
Are you abandoning this ship

36:02.627 --> 36:04.959
because the mission
wasn't what you expected

36:05.029 --> 36:07.827
or because being a Captain
wasn't what you expected?

36:07.899 --> 36:10.834
l am perfectly capable
of commanding a starship.

36:10.935 --> 36:12.232
Are you?

36:12.336 --> 36:14.304
Clearly, you're uncomfortable
with the role--

36:14.372 --> 36:15.839
delegating tasks, giving orders.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.872
Someone died
following my orders!

36:17.942 --> 36:20.240
You can't blame yourself
for that.

36:20.311 --> 36:22.176
A Captain's responsible
for the lives of his crew.

36:22.246 --> 36:24.612
People sometimes die
on missions,

36:24.682 --> 36:26.707
despite the Captain's
best efforts.

36:26.784 --> 36:30.049
l should have stuck to
playing Buster Kincaid.

36:30.121 --> 36:34.581
A holodeck program can be turned
off when it no longer suits you.

36:34.659 --> 36:36.524
Reality can't.

36:41.499 --> 36:44.559
lf you really feel responsible
for this crew,

36:44.669 --> 36:46.398
you'll help them get home,

36:46.504 --> 36:49.268
because they won't survive
without you.

36:53.644 --> 36:57.171
ls that some new
kind of weapon?

36:57.248 --> 37:00.411
They're scanning pulses designed
to illuminate cloaked ships.

37:00.484 --> 37:02.645
lf we hit one,
we'll be exposed.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.483
How are we going
to get through?

37:04.555 --> 37:06.750
We'll find a way.

37:06.824 --> 37:08.815
l thought you were leaving.

37:08.926 --> 37:11.394
l get claustrophobic
in escape pods.

37:11.462 --> 37:13.327
Switch to manual helm control.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.558
Full power to shields.

37:17.535 --> 37:19.765
Aye, Captain.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.054
Two Annari ships
have entered orbit.

37:37.121 --> 37:38.088
They are hailing.

37:38.155 --> 37:39.179
On screen.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.385
Captain Geral, we have
12 isotons of ore for you.

37:42.460 --> 37:45.429
l'm under orders to escort you
out of Annari space,

37:45.496 --> 37:46.986
immediately.

37:47.064 --> 37:48.588
You've been supporting
our enemy.

37:48.666 --> 37:49.894
You must be mistaken.

37:50.067 --> 37:50.897
A shuttlecraft

37:51.068 --> 37:52.558
matching your hull composition

37:52.670 --> 37:54.797
fired on one of our ships
several days ago.

37:54.905 --> 37:57.430
And we recently detected
two human bio-signatures

37:57.541 --> 37:58.940
on a Kraylor warship.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.204
l can explain that.

38:00.311 --> 38:01.539
lf you don't leave immediately,

38:01.579 --> 38:03.410
we'll be forced to fire on you.

38:03.481 --> 38:06.006
Our warp drive
is still being repaired.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.643
Then we'll escort you
at impulse.

38:08.719 --> 38:11.051
You have five minutes
to lift off.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.092
So much for our new
deuterium injectors.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.751
What about Harry and Seven?

38:16.827 --> 38:18.124
We'll go looking for them,

38:18.195 --> 38:20.857
as soon as we get rid
of our escort.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.064
Evasive maneuvers.

38:31.275 --> 38:32.867
There are too many of them.

38:32.943 --> 38:34.205
You're doing fine.

38:34.278 --> 38:35.768
Just try to stay
at least 100 meters

38:35.846 --> 38:37.040
ahead of the closest pulse.

38:37.114 --> 38:38.672
Yes, sir.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.877
We should return fire.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.112
No, that would only give them

38:43.187 --> 38:44.916
another way to
triangulate our position.

38:48.893 --> 38:50.383
Our shields are failing.

38:50.461 --> 38:53.089
We're losing structural
integrity on the lower decks.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.859
Reroute emergency power.

38:55.933 --> 38:57.093
lt's insufficient.

38:57.201 --> 38:59.761
Open a channel
to the lead Annari ship.

38:59.870 --> 39:00.928
Sir?

39:01.038 --> 39:01.766
Do it.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.133
Aye, sir.

39:06.777 --> 39:10.042
This is Captain Kim of
the Kraylor Vessel Nightingale.

39:10.114 --> 39:13.049
l'm prepared to discuss terms
for our surrender.

39:14.418 --> 39:15.476
End transmission.

39:15.553 --> 39:17.418
We trusted you.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.819
And you still should.

39:18.889 --> 39:19.981
They're responding.

39:20.057 --> 39:22.389
l don't have time to explain.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.484
On screen.

39:24.829 --> 39:27.354
Your surrender
will be unconditional.

39:27.431 --> 39:28.693
No, it won't.

39:28.766 --> 39:31.496
Either you allow my crew
to evacuate to the surface,

39:31.602 --> 39:33.399
or l'll put this ship
on self-destruct.

39:33.504 --> 39:34.766
You'll never get

39:34.872 --> 39:35.839
the cloaking technology.

39:36.006 --> 39:38.031
Something tells me
your superiors won't be happy

39:38.142 --> 39:40.303
about that.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.573
Your crew will be taken
aboard my vessel

39:42.646 --> 39:44.978
and brought
to an Annari detention center.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.040
My crew is going to the
surface in escape pods.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.245
Once they're clear,
you can lock on

39:49.320 --> 39:51.049
to this ship
with a tractor beam.

39:52.857 --> 39:53.846
Agreed.

39:53.924 --> 39:56.791
You've two minutes to evacuate.

39:56.861 --> 39:59.227
l will not abandon this ship.

39:59.296 --> 40:00.888
l'm glad to hear that,

40:00.965 --> 40:02.899
because l'm going
to need you here.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.298
Get your people into
the pods... quickly.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.631
But the cloak...

40:06.737 --> 40:08.102
l've got a plan to save it.

40:08.172 --> 40:10.640
lf l fail, at least
the scientist who designed it

40:10.741 --> 40:12.606
will be alive
to create another one.

40:17.948 --> 40:21.406
Seven, scan the Annari's
tractor emitters.

40:21.485 --> 40:23.783
l need to know
the exact beam polarity.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.515
What are we going to do?

40:25.589 --> 40:28.456
Once they lock on to us,
they're going to come about

40:28.526 --> 40:29.959
and pull us away
from the planet.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.186
As soon as they do,

40:31.262 --> 40:33.253
we're going to reverse
our shield polarity.

40:33.330 --> 40:34.422
lf we time it right,

40:34.498 --> 40:35.897
it should give us
enough momentum

40:35.966 --> 40:37.729
to outrun them
to the defense perimeter.

40:37.835 --> 40:40.303
We're going to use their
own weapons against them?

40:40.404 --> 40:41.735
The escape pods are away.

40:47.711 --> 40:50.043
Disengage the cloak.

40:52.249 --> 40:54.444
They've locked on.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.681
Sir?

40:57.755 --> 40:59.689
Not yet.

40:59.757 --> 41:02.453
Steady.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.822
Now!

41:09.099 --> 41:10.361
Status?

41:10.468 --> 41:11.696
Shields are failing.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.770
Four Annari vessels
are in pursuit.

41:13.838 --> 41:14.896
They're closing.

41:15.005 --> 41:16.336
Full thrusters!

41:18.342 --> 41:19.775
Shields are down.

41:19.844 --> 41:22.278
Get us through that defense
perimeter, Mr. Terek.

41:22.346 --> 41:24.439
Yes, sir.

41:31.522 --> 41:33.717
We're inside.

41:33.791 --> 41:35.986
The Annari have
broken off their pursuit.

41:38.796 --> 41:41.162
Take us to the surface,
Mr. Terek.

41:52.643 --> 41:55.111
We've just crossed out
of Annari space.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.373
Our escorts have broken off.

41:56.447 --> 41:57.436
They're going to warp.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.176
Bring the long-range sensors
on line.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.512
You and Tom, take the Flyer.

42:00.618 --> 42:03.052
Start your search
at Harry's last known position.

42:03.087 --> 42:04.748
Tuvok, send an
encrypted message

42:04.822 --> 42:06.153
to the Kraylor homeworld.

42:06.223 --> 42:08.384
See if they know where
Harry and Seven are.

42:08.459 --> 42:10.393
That won't be
necessary, Captain.

42:10.461 --> 42:12.156
Ensign Kim is hailing us.

42:12.229 --> 42:13.491
From where?

42:13.564 --> 42:14.826
A cloaked vessel.

42:14.899 --> 42:18.096
lt's directly astern.

42:18.202 --> 42:22.639
Acting Captain's Personal Log,
Stardate 54282.5.

42:22.740 --> 42:23.764
Final entry.

42:23.874 --> 42:26.035
New cloaking systems
are being installed

42:26.110 --> 42:27.270
in other Kraylor ships,

42:27.344 --> 42:29.369
so l guess
the mission was a success.

42:29.446 --> 42:32.574
Still, l wish
l felt better about it.

42:34.518 --> 42:35.951
Welcome home.

42:36.020 --> 42:38.955
lt's good to be back.

42:39.023 --> 42:41.924
So, what'll it be tonight?

42:41.992 --> 42:44.222
l have a light
Tula cheese soufflé

42:44.295 --> 42:46.195
or a zesty lasagna.

42:46.263 --> 42:49.255
You know, Neelix,
the truth is, l'm not sure.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.358
l thought
we talked about this.

42:51.468 --> 42:52.935
A Captain has to be deci...

42:53.003 --> 42:55.494
l'm not a Captain, Neelix.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.840
Not yet, anyway.
