My name's Zack,
and I'm a video game addict.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.473
ALL:
Hi, Zack.

21:14.607 --> 21:18.244
I used to stay up half
the night slaying monsters.

21:18.311 --> 21:22.382
It got so bad,
I found myself dreaming about orcs.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.617
Yeah, I used to dream about girls.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.153
MOSEBY:
I hear you, buddy.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.059
My name is Marion,
and I'm a video game addict.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.829
ALL:
Hi, Marion.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.031
I'm out of control, okay?

21:38.098 --> 21:40.834
I mean, I started building
a moat in my backyard.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.202
And I live in a condo!

21:43.636 --> 21:46.373
-[ZACK SIGHS]
-It's just so hard.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.907
One day at a time, Jango.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.143
[ALL GASP]
Jango?

21:50.210 --> 21:53.513
-Oh, please.
-Yeah, that's right-- Jango Darkblade.

21:54.481 --> 21:58.218
You know, I noticed when we came in,
the security guard had a laptop.

21:58.885 --> 22:02.822
Oh! No, wait, wait.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.758
No, no, no, no.

22:04.824 --> 22:05.825
You mustn't.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.293
Just stay.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.496
Because I call dibs!

22:09.562 --> 22:11.231
Last one there's a rotten orc!
