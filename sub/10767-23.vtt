00:03.773 --> 00:07.448
<i>Yo, yo, what's up? This is Will.
I can 't get to the phone right now.</i>

00:07.613 --> 00:10.207
<i>I kind of got my hands full.</i>

00:11.973 --> 00:17.252
<i>So leave a message, unless this
is Carlton, in which case, don 't.</i>

00:19.213 --> 00:21.283
<i>Will, it's Carlton.</i>

00:21.613 --> 00:23.410
<i>I got an emergency.</i>

00:25.413 --> 00:26.926
<i>Will, we just finished dinner...</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:30.642
<i>... and I think I left my wallet
on the dresser, so could...</i>

00:32.052 --> 00:35.762
- Who was that?
- It's just a wrong number, baby.

00:41.853 --> 00:43.172
Now, where was I?

00:43.333 --> 00:45.449
Oh, there I was.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.923
Greetings. Look, munchkin,
a romantic dinner for two.

00:49.093 --> 00:51.323
Jazzy, maybe we should
revise our plans.

00:51.493 --> 00:55.122
You're right, my pet.
Let's unpack after we eat.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

02:04.853 --> 02:07.526
I told the landlord,
I don't you repainting our apartment.

02:07.733 --> 02:09.211
Those stains have memories.

02:12.533 --> 02:16.572
<i>Jazz, homey, look, now,
you know, mi casa es su casa.</i>

02:16.773 --> 02:20.482
<i>But, look, tonight,
mi casa es mi casa.</i>

02:24.653 --> 02:26.564
That's okay, Will, I think I better go.

02:26.733 --> 02:31.329
But, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey, baby.
Come on, you ain't got to do that.

02:31.493 --> 02:33.404
Oh, yes, I do. I'm really hungry.

02:35.893 --> 02:40.011
Hey, baby, baby, I can have some
Rotiserie Gold here in six minutes.

02:43.973 --> 02:47.124
Well, you've done it again,
haven't you?

02:47.293 --> 02:48.612
Done what, Jazzy?

02:48.773 --> 02:51.685
Munchkin, perhaps our visit
is a little ill-timed.

02:52.093 --> 02:56.006
Don't worry, me and Jewel
could sleep out on a park bench.

02:56.173 --> 02:59.483
I hear rain is nature's moisturizer.

03:00.493 --> 03:02.882
Well, look,
y'all might as well just stay.

03:03.053 --> 03:05.283
You done messed
everything up already anyway.

03:05.453 --> 03:08.206
Thanks for hanging up.
I got thrown out of the restaurant...

03:08.373 --> 03:10.648
...and got a ticket for driving
without a license.

03:10.813 --> 03:12.371
What are they doing here?

03:12.533 --> 03:14.285
Jazz's apartment is getting repainted.

03:14.493 --> 03:15.926
Oh, like I care.

03:16.573 --> 03:21.044
I'm going to my room, putting on
my jammies and calling it a D-A-Y.

03:22.773 --> 03:26.209
Either his head's getting smaller
or his butt's getting bigger.

03:29.893 --> 03:32.646
There's a whole army
of these action figures around my bed.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.646
They're fertility gods, Carlton.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.681
Wait.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.525
Y'all trying to have a baby?

03:42.693 --> 03:44.331
Yeah.

03:44.493 --> 03:47.883
Just because we're away from the
marital bed don't mean we ain't gonna:

03:56.613 --> 03:58.126
Hey, whoa, whoa, guys.

03:58.373 --> 04:00.204
Hey, listen.

04:01.853 --> 04:05.402
I'm all for this being fruitful
and multiplying thing...

04:05.573 --> 04:07.768
...but it's kind
of close quarters here...

04:07.973 --> 04:11.249
...so you think y'all can put
a boom-shaka-lock on it for a minute?

04:11.533 --> 04:14.969
I'd like to accommodate you,
my brother, but we're on a mission.

04:15.173 --> 04:17.892
Not on my Posturepedic, bud.

04:18.773 --> 04:20.411
Excuse us for a second.

04:20.572 --> 04:21.801
Listen, Jazz, man, look.

04:21.973 --> 04:24.806
I'm happy for you and your wife,
but you think this mission...

04:24.973 --> 04:29.205
...could get scrubbed for a minute until
your rocket is back on its launching pad?

04:29.613 --> 04:30.841
No can do, Will.

04:31.013 --> 04:34.972
The doctor at the clinic says
this is when I'm at my most fertile...

04:35.173 --> 04:38.882
...which reminds me, sweetie.
I took my temperature, all systems go.

04:39.173 --> 04:41.971
- Permission to board the mother ship.
- Yeah.

04:42.133 --> 04:43.691
Yeah.

04:43.853 --> 04:45.172
Oh, no, you don't.

04:45.373 --> 04:48.012
There'll be no boarding
of any kind, Mr. And Mrs...

04:48.173 --> 04:50.448
What the heck
is your last name anyway?

04:50.613 --> 04:53.047
Hey, that's my bed.

04:53.213 --> 04:56.364
Carlton, relax, I'll get you
some new Barney sheets.

05:08.093 --> 05:11.130
I cannot believe they're at it again.

05:11.653 --> 05:13.962
Man, they are not human.

05:15.053 --> 05:18.329
Hey, Jazz. This ain't funny, man.

05:18.653 --> 05:21.247
I command you to stop.

05:22.533 --> 05:25.764
Roll away from the woman.

05:45.213 --> 05:49.491
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna go sleep with Mom and Dad.

05:50.173 --> 05:52.892
Careful Uncle Phil
doesn't roll over on you again.

05:59.613 --> 06:02.332
Well, the little darling's fast asleep.

06:02.573 --> 06:04.768
Are you sure you didn't kill her?

06:05.893 --> 06:07.849
I realize what a inconvenience
we've been.

06:08.013 --> 06:12.006
But since you ain't getting us no wedding
present, this is the least you could do.

06:12.293 --> 06:15.683
What are you talking about, man?
I gave you a wedding.

06:15.893 --> 06:17.884
Take that to the bank.

06:18.813 --> 06:22.010
Look, Will, making a baby
is a truly blessed event.

06:23.253 --> 06:25.448
I think you mean
"having a baby," Jazz.

06:25.893 --> 06:27.724
Trust me on this.

06:29.653 --> 06:33.771
Look, Will, my Jewel's fondest dream
is to have a child of her own.

06:34.933 --> 06:36.685
I love her.

06:37.053 --> 06:38.930
She's my delicate little flower.

06:39.293 --> 06:41.568
Yo, crank it up!

06:46.853 --> 06:49.925
Hey, take it easy in there,
we're not insured.

06:51.933 --> 06:55.812
Well, I don't think it's a very good idea
for Jazz and Jewel to reproduce.

06:55.973 --> 06:59.443
Right, big guy.
The prisons are crowded enough.

07:00.093 --> 07:01.412
That's not fair.

07:01.573 --> 07:04.133
If Jazz and Jewel wanna bring
a child into this world...

07:04.293 --> 07:06.887
...who are we to judge?
We're not exactly perfect.

07:07.773 --> 07:09.809
Hello.

07:12.053 --> 07:15.011
So have you kids shopped
for Mother's Day?

07:15.173 --> 07:17.607
I'm afraid I haven't had
a chance to buy their gifts.

07:17.773 --> 07:20.162
- I'll get to the mall after lunch.
- Wait a minute.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.210
Geoffrey is picking out your presents?

07:22.413 --> 07:25.371
Of course not, big guy.
We told him exactly what to get.

07:25.533 --> 07:29.412
Oh, yes.
Down to the very last detail, sir.

07:29.573 --> 07:34.044
Let's see, there's " some kind of perfume
or something," from Miss Hilary.

07:34.213 --> 07:36.647
"A book might be neat,"
from Miss Ashley.

07:36.813 --> 07:40.169
And, " here's 20 bucks
and I expect some change back"...

07:40.773 --> 07:42.411
...from Master Carlton.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.010
I can't believe you kids.

07:46.173 --> 07:49.688
How will your mother feel when she finds
out you didn't do your own shopping?

07:49.853 --> 07:52.651
Oh, I have no problem
with my own shopping.

07:53.253 --> 07:55.289
I got my Mom something
she gonna love.

07:55.453 --> 07:59.082
She always wanted to get my baby shoes
bronzed, but she never got around to it.

07:59.253 --> 08:01.130
So I hooked her up.

08:04.493 --> 08:06.131
Those are your baby shoes?

08:06.293 --> 08:08.682
Well, yeah. I had big feet.

08:09.773 --> 08:13.288
You know what they say
about a guy with big feet.

08:14.013 --> 08:15.685
No, what?

08:22.613 --> 08:26.367
They be saying,
"Damn, you got some big feet."

08:30.293 --> 08:31.772
Well...

08:32.693 --> 08:35.160
As much as it pains me to admit it...

08:35.332 --> 08:37.607
...Will's got the right idea.

08:39.133 --> 08:42.489
This year, I want you
to pick out something handpicked...

08:42.653 --> 08:44.291
...personal and from the heart.

08:44.453 --> 08:45.966
Now, you go out there and shop.

08:46.973 --> 08:49.931
Yeah, that's right.
Feel ashamed of your sorry selves.

08:50.093 --> 08:53.005
You feel ashamed
of your sorry selves.

08:54.293 --> 08:56.932
- Eloquent, sirs.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.

08:57.093 --> 08:59.766
Makes me wanna do something
special for Mrs. Banks myself.

08:59.933 --> 09:03.243
So you don't want me
to get the usual dozen roses?

09:04.733 --> 09:06.610
No, that's good enough.

09:13.733 --> 09:15.371
Hey, Will.

09:15.613 --> 09:18.923
Hey, I'm surprised y'all can walk.

09:20.173 --> 09:22.289
Your levity is inappropriate.

09:22.453 --> 09:24.444
We've been at the free clinic
all morning...

09:24.613 --> 09:28.083
...to find out
why my oven is as yet bunless.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.047
Y'all haven't been baking long.

09:34.213 --> 09:37.444
Hey, and I'm sure,
if you stick with that recipe...

09:37.653 --> 09:39.484
...you'll get the ingredients mixed up...

09:39.693 --> 09:42.890
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

09:43.053 --> 09:45.692
I mean, we ain't
never gonna have a baby...

09:46.013 --> 09:48.573
...because my little soldiers
ain't marching.

09:59.213 --> 10:00.692
Bummer.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.971
Jazz, didn't I tell you
to not be wearing them bikini drawers?

10:08.173 --> 10:10.164
You told me not to wear them
in the streets.

10:10.333 --> 10:13.131
- You ain't tell me not to wear them.
- All right, all right.

10:13.493 --> 10:16.007
You know what?
It's probably just stress.

10:16.173 --> 10:17.925
Yeah. I'm sure that's what it is, man.

10:18.133 --> 10:21.728
I mean, y'all just got married, and
you're always running from the law.

10:21.933 --> 10:23.366
And you know what?

10:23.733 --> 10:27.043
Why don't you go to another
free clinic, get a second opinion.

10:27.213 --> 10:29.090
We can't afford another free clinic.

10:31.333 --> 10:35.485
Jazz, look.
I'm really sorry for you, man.

10:35.773 --> 10:39.129
I mean, hey, at least y'all tried.

10:39.493 --> 10:41.688
Never heard two people try harder.

10:42.613 --> 10:46.401
Don't try to comfort me, Will.
I'm uncomfortable.

10:54.893 --> 10:57.805
Hey, look, Jewel.

10:58.333 --> 11:02.087
- I'm sorry. If there's anything I can do...
- As a matter of fact, there is.

11:02.253 --> 11:03.845
Whatever it is, just let me know.

11:04.013 --> 11:05.890
- You really mean that, Will?
- Name it.

11:06.053 --> 11:07.452
I want your little soldiers.

11:12.613 --> 11:15.889
What do you say? Can I have
your baby? I'd really appreciate it.

11:18.493 --> 11:23.089
Jewel, come on.
You are my best friend's wife.

11:23.253 --> 11:26.563
As much as that excites me,
I think I better pass.

11:27.133 --> 11:31.445
I don't want your body, Will.
I want your little soldiers.

11:31.853 --> 11:34.003
Do I look like the U. N?

11:38.933 --> 11:41.686
Jewel, if Jazz ever found out
about this, it would kill him.

11:41.853 --> 11:43.366
So you in?

11:43.813 --> 11:45.166
You know about this?

11:45.333 --> 11:48.006
Know about it? It was my idea.

11:48.893 --> 11:51.123
What are y'all asking me to do?

11:51.293 --> 11:55.764
Hey, look. How about I give y'all
something else, like a VCR?

11:56.293 --> 11:58.932
You hear that, munchkin?
He's giving us a VCR too.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.209
He's so full of love.

12:01.373 --> 12:03.125
Let's hope so.

12:03.333 --> 12:07.121
Come on, having a baby
is a big responsibility.

12:07.293 --> 12:11.445
We're ready for it. Why, I even started
saving for little Junior's college fund.

12:13.213 --> 12:15.966
Listen, I don't think I can do this.

12:16.133 --> 12:17.407
Sure you can.

12:17.573 --> 12:18.801
Will.

12:18.973 --> 12:21.089
Remember that time
we went to go play ball...

12:21.253 --> 12:24.529
...and your shoelace broke
and I gave you mine?

12:24.853 --> 12:26.491
Same thing.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.361
Jazz, man.

12:29.573 --> 12:31.643
Don't you have some relatives
or something?

12:31.813 --> 12:33.246
Why me?

12:33.413 --> 12:36.211
I mean, you got a good heart.

12:36.373 --> 12:38.887
And you got a lot of smarts...

12:39.053 --> 12:42.090
...and you're tall,
and you got good teeth.

12:43.733 --> 12:46.201
Of course, we'll be praying
he gets my ears.

12:51.173 --> 12:53.129
We really want this baby, Will.

12:53.293 --> 12:54.772
I mean, we love him already.

12:54.973 --> 12:56.167
And we love you too.

12:56.373 --> 12:59.683
And there's no one else we'd ask
to be a part of our family.

13:02.973 --> 13:04.770
How about a toaster?

13:06.093 --> 13:07.845
Kids, I don't know how to thank you.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.165
Such thoughtful gifts.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.686
Well, you deserve them, Mom.

13:11.893 --> 13:13.406
And these roses...

13:13.773 --> 13:16.241
...they are exquisite.

13:16.453 --> 13:17.681
Thank you, honey.

13:18.093 --> 13:19.924
You're welcome.

13:21.693 --> 13:24.685
Well, you know,
it's the thought that counts.

13:24.853 --> 13:29.085
Yes, so think about
sleeping on the couch for a while.

13:30.813 --> 13:33.885
Mother, I wanted to buy you
the perfect gift.

13:34.093 --> 13:36.766
Something that would show you
just how special you are.

13:36.933 --> 13:39.766
But I couldn't find it,
so I made it myself.

13:39.933 --> 13:42.003
You made something?

13:42.773 --> 13:45.571
Hilary, you can't even make change.

13:46.013 --> 13:48.766
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can't even make...

13:49.653 --> 13:51.291
Oh, shut up.

13:52.733 --> 13:55.930
Anyway, I put this together at work.

13:56.093 --> 13:59.244
My tribute to Vivian Banks.

14:01.533 --> 14:05.082
It's a celebration
of your greatest accomplishment.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.883
Don't try to talk.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.408
Let's all just share this moment.

15:15.933 --> 15:18.049
May I help you?

15:18.933 --> 15:20.491
Smith.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.771
Will Smith.

15:23.693 --> 15:27.686
I got appointment, you know,
for the drawing.

15:27.853 --> 15:31.448
You're a little embarrassed,
aren't you?

15:31.613 --> 15:35.128
Don't worry,
we're all professionals here.

15:35.813 --> 15:37.451
Thanks a lot.

15:37.613 --> 15:38.932
I appreciate that.

15:39.133 --> 15:42.364
Gladys, another customer
for the happy booth.

15:47.373 --> 15:51.844
Just have a seat
and think lovely thoughts.

15:57.973 --> 15:59.406
Yeah.

16:04.573 --> 16:06.643
First time, kid?

16:06.973 --> 16:08.565
Well, no, actually, I was 11...

16:08.773 --> 16:10.729
Oh, you mean, here?

16:11.973 --> 16:13.770
Yeah, yeah.

16:14.973 --> 16:18.932
- How about you?
- You kidding? I come here once a week.

16:19.773 --> 16:21.001
Why?

16:21.173 --> 16:23.528
Well, a lot of couples
wanna have babies and can't.

16:23.693 --> 16:27.652
I like to think of myself
as nature's middleman.

16:29.733 --> 16:33.772
Kind of like a Johnny Appleseed
without the apples, huh?

16:35.893 --> 16:37.212
Once a week.

16:38.133 --> 16:39.691
Mr. Considine?

16:39.853 --> 16:41.252
I'm up.

16:41.413 --> 16:43.722
- Good luck.
- Hey, hey, good luck.

16:48.853 --> 16:51.731
Here you are, my brother,
I brought you a card.

16:51.973 --> 16:53.964
Hey, thanks, Jazz.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.643
"Heard you had a stroke"?

16:57.893 --> 17:00.168
It was the closest we could find.

17:00.333 --> 17:04.326
You know, for some reason,
Hallmark has overlooked this occasion.

17:07.413 --> 17:08.811
Jazz.

17:08.973 --> 17:11.042
I gotta be honest, man.

17:11.213 --> 17:13.681
I'm just kind of nervous about this.

17:13.853 --> 17:15.844
You want me to go in with you?

17:18.772 --> 17:20.286
Look, Jazz, come on. I mean...

17:20.453 --> 17:22.204
What are you gonna tell people?

17:22.613 --> 17:24.968
I'm gonna tell them it's my kid.

17:25.453 --> 17:27.284
Will, this is between us.

17:27.453 --> 17:30.047
No one must know
of my secret shame.

17:30.213 --> 17:31.771
The oath.

17:39.333 --> 17:42.564
And to show you how grateful we are,
we're taking you out tonight.

17:42.733 --> 17:45.008
You know, in honor of Mother's Day.

17:45.173 --> 17:46.686
Thanks a lot, Jazz.

17:46.853 --> 17:48.764
I could just kiss you.

17:48.933 --> 17:52.289
You know, that's not exactly
the image I need right now.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.084
Jazz Junior.

18:02.173 --> 18:05.563
<i>So join us in bidding goodbye
to Jazz Junior...</i>

18:05.773 --> 18:09.448
<i>... the greatest player
in the history of the NBA.</i>

18:20.453 --> 18:23.411
That boy down there
has got good genes.

18:23.573 --> 18:24.847
That boy got good genes.

18:25.013 --> 18:28.642
You can't play no ball like that
without having no good genes.

18:28.813 --> 18:30.929
That my seat. Move over.

18:33.573 --> 18:35.882
<i>And now, stepping up to the mike...</i>

18:36.053 --> 18:40.683
<i>... the one, the only, Jazz Junior.</i>

18:43.813 --> 18:45.565
I just wanna say...

18:45.773 --> 18:47.809
...that I owe it all to one man.

18:50.493 --> 18:52.165
My father.

18:52.453 --> 18:54.489
Stand up, Dad, take a bow.

19:12.773 --> 19:16.482
I'm sorry, Will,
but you don't belong here.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.683
Ready, Mr. Smith?

19:35.933 --> 19:37.969
No, I'm not.

19:38.533 --> 19:40.444
I don't belong here.

19:50.973 --> 19:54.090
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

19:54.253 --> 19:57.245
Y'all at least could have waited
until I got here before you ate.

19:57.453 --> 20:00.445
Oh, we didn't order.
This was here when we sat down.

20:00.973 --> 20:02.486
They're cheap tippers too.

20:02.653 --> 20:04.848
Less than 15 percent.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.885
- Will, I got some big news.
- Jewel, Jewel, listen.

20:10.093 --> 20:12.049
Look, I got something
I need to tell y'all.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.971
- But we...
- Jazzy, listen.

20:14.373 --> 20:19.367
Now, this whole having-a-kid thing,
I'm telling you, it's overrated, man.

20:19.533 --> 20:21.012
Babies.

20:21.173 --> 20:25.451
I mean, they all bald
and stanked up and nasty...

20:25.653 --> 20:27.166
- Will, I'm pregnant.
- Jewel.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.848
I was sitting up in the clinic...
I'm sorry, did you say something?

20:31.013 --> 20:33.447
We're gonna have a baby,
Jazzy and me.

20:34.053 --> 20:36.009
How the hell did that happen?

20:37.013 --> 20:40.289
Brother, I think
me and you should talk.

20:40.933 --> 20:45.165
No, I mean, one of your little soldiers
established a beachhead?

20:46.373 --> 20:48.170
You're gonna be a daddy?

20:50.493 --> 20:52.165
Hey, congratulations, man.

20:52.333 --> 20:56.167
Hey, listen, they having a kid
and I ain't had nothing to do with it.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.405
- Oh. Man.
- Thanks, Will, for everything.

21:00.573 --> 21:02.052
Hey.

21:02.933 --> 21:04.571
Happy Mother's Day, Jewel.

21:04.733 --> 21:06.485
Thanks, Will.

21:06.653 --> 21:08.609
Come here, man, come here.

21:08.933 --> 21:12.243
I know we invited you to dinner,
but would you mind paying for it?

21:12.413 --> 21:15.086
I saw my picture
over the cash register.

21:15.533 --> 21:19.321
Come on, Jazzy, let's hit the salad bar.
I brought my big purse.

21:25.253 --> 21:27.813
I know you were looking forward
to being a part of this.

21:27.973 --> 21:30.328
- I hope you're not too disappointed.
- Oh, that.

21:30.533 --> 21:33.570
You know what they say.
"Easy come, easy go."

21:34.053 --> 21:37.125
I guess the world will have to wait
a little for Will Smith, Jr.

21:37.293 --> 21:39.409
He'll come along someday.

21:43.613 --> 21:46.127
Hey! Happy Mother's Day, brother.

21:46.653 --> 21:47.927
Oh, yeah.

21:48.133 --> 21:50.169
Oh, man.

21:52.613 --> 21:56.288
Good evening, sir, would you like
to hear tonight's specials?

22:05.933 --> 22:08.686
No, you... No, thanks, man.
You know what?

22:08.853 --> 22:11.321
You know what?
I just lost my damn appetite.

22:17.173 --> 22:20.688
How will your mother feel when she finds
out you didn't do your own shopping?

22:20.893 --> 22:22.531
I have no...

22:25.173 --> 22:28.882
How will your mother feel when she finds
out you didn't do your own shopping?

22:29.093 --> 22:30.765
Oh, I have no...

22:31.693 --> 22:33.923
Same place. We're rolling.

22:35.493 --> 22:37.688
Space, the final frontier.
