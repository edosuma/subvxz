00:32.336 --> 00:34.599
It's Nina, right?

00:34.773 --> 00:36.601
You'll never get it.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.908
I won't let you.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.563
I didn't askfor
your permission.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.217
[wry laugh]

00:43.391 --> 00:46.394
It's only a matter
of time, you know,

00:46.568 --> 00:48.309
before I get the Box.

00:48.483 --> 00:49.962
Over my dead body.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.964
You know, that's the thing
with you guardians--

00:52.139 --> 00:55.794
you're always dying
for that damn box.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.013
Not always.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.843
[grunts]

01:05.630 --> 01:07.763
Oh, come on.

01:07.937 --> 01:10.026
You can do better than that.

01:38.924 --> 01:39.969
Phoebe?

01:40.143 --> 01:41.449
Coming!

01:41.623 --> 01:43.451
Coming--
I used castor root this time.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.105
It should dull
all the senses.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.846
I don't care.
Just give it to me.

01:51.241 --> 01:53.200
Thank you.

01:53.374 --> 01:54.940
Do you mind?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.551
Do I mind what?[eerie ringing]

01:56.725 --> 02:01.817
Being so psychotically perky
while I'm so miserable.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.471
You know, maybe
it's psychosomatic.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.125
I mean, the inner ear
has to do with balance,

02:05.299 --> 02:06.778
so maybe you're feeling
imbalanced because of

02:06.952 --> 02:09.477
the whole Magic
School thing.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.435
Phoebe, come here.

02:11.609 --> 02:12.784
Ow!

02:12.958 --> 02:14.438
[laughing]:
What was that for?

02:14.612 --> 02:17.267
Does that seem
psychosomatic to you?

02:20.705 --> 02:22.229
Hey, big boy!

02:22.403 --> 02:24.013
I thought it
was bath time.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.233
LEO:
Uh, it is.

02:26.407 --> 02:29.540
Uh, hey, buddy,
that was, uh...

02:29.714 --> 02:32.674
pretty funny, but I don't
think Mommy's gonna think so.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.023
What's going on?

02:34.197 --> 02:36.330
Uh, I think the terrible
twos have begun.

02:36.504 --> 02:39.159
Eh, well, magical boys
will be magical boys.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.987
Yeah, well, try explaining
that to his magical mama.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.641
Listen, I think
you better orb

02:43.815 --> 02:45.730
back upstairs before Mommy
turns you into a toad.

02:47.384 --> 02:50.518
PAIGE:Ow...

02:50.692 --> 02:51.736
[groans]

02:51.910 --> 02:52.955
What's the matter?

02:53.129 --> 02:54.130
She has a ringing
in her ears.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.611
No, it's more like
a jackhammer.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.265
Really? Is it kind of like
a dentist's drill

02:58.439 --> 02:59.570
that kind of goes in and out?

02:59.744 --> 03:00.615
Yeah.

03:00.789 --> 03:01.746
Why? You know what it is?

03:01.920 --> 03:03.095
Well, it could be, uh,

03:03.270 --> 03:04.575
your whitelighter powers
coming on.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.708
You know, you could be
hearing the call

03:06.882 --> 03:08.188
from the Elders.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.189
Before I learned
to control my powers,

03:09.363 --> 03:10.102
it used to drive me nuts.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.192
No, that's unacceptable.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.671
Aah...LEO:
Okay, well, you're

03:13.845 --> 03:15.325
half whitelighter,
you can't deny that.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.674
Yes, I can.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.372
I want nothing to do
with the Elders,

03:18.546 --> 03:20.461
okay?LEO:
All right, well,

03:20.635 --> 03:22.811
if it is what I think it is,
you're not gonna have a choice.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.943
The only way to find out is
to actually talk to an Elder.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.728
PHOEBE:Well, you can't
bring one over here.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.469
Piper will freak out.LEO:
All right.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.079
Well, then maybe you should meet
at Magic School.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.472
LEO:
Look,

03:31.646 --> 03:32.777
do you want it to stop,
or don't you?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.258
Come on, I'll go with you.

Who are you?

03:44.267 --> 03:45.834
Please.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.445
You have to help me find it,
before it's too late.

03:48.619 --> 03:49.446
Find what?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.753
Pandora's box.

I don't know why
I'd be surprised

05:37.815 --> 05:40.470
that Pandora's Box is, as well.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.342
Thank you.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.952
How did you know to come to us?

05:44.126 --> 05:46.084
You're the Charmed Ones.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.783
Everyone in the magical
community knows about you.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.132
Yeah.

05:50.306 --> 05:52.308
That's becoming a problem.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.093
Hey!

PIPER:Um...

05:56.443 --> 05:57.574
mister?

05:57.748 --> 05:59.228
Excuse me.

Listen, what did I tell
you about the orbing?

PIPER:
Okay? Only when I say so.

06:03.711 --> 06:04.842
Thank you very much.

PHOEBE:
Piper, you can't deny

06:06.670 --> 06:09.543
who he is, through the good,
the bad and the annoying.

06:09.717 --> 06:12.241
Oh, I see you've been talking
to Leo, haven't you?

06:12.415 --> 06:13.895
Look, just because

06:14.069 --> 06:15.375
you guys have completely
different parenting styles

06:15.549 --> 06:17.202
doesn't mean
you can take it out on me.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.595
I'm just the sister.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.336
And whose side are you on
exactly?

06:20.510 --> 06:21.381
[laughs]

06:21.555 --> 06:22.382
Back to the Box?

06:22.556 --> 06:23.644
Right.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.820
Okay, let me guess--
a demon took it.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.691
No.

06:27.865 --> 06:30.302
But we better find the next
guardian before one does.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.261
Guardian?

06:32.435 --> 06:34.132
NINA:
Like you,
we're chosen beings.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.786
Part of a magical lineage.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.746
One in which every generation
a girl is born,

06:38.920 --> 06:40.748
meant to guard Pandora's Box.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.402
PIPER:
Right, hence the name

06:42.576 --> 06:43.577
guardian-- got it.

06:43.751 --> 06:44.926
NINA:
Only each girl is

06:45.100 --> 06:47.058
trained by
the previous guardian,

06:47.232 --> 06:48.582
instructed carefully about

06:48.756 --> 06:51.672
the dangers
and powers of the Box.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.935
Except the next one hasn't been.

06:54.109 --> 06:55.371
I'm not following.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.460
NINA:
When Katya, the demon,
attacked me,

06:57.634 --> 07:00.420
the Box, perhaps
sensing the danger,

07:00.594 --> 07:01.856
disappeared on its own,

07:02.030 --> 07:03.814
moving on to its next guardian.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.686
And you don't know
who that is.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.252
No.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.299
I guess I wasn't expected
to survive.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.867
So, what does Katya want
with the Box?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.608
She wants to open it

07:14.782 --> 07:16.784
and release
the world's ills:

07:16.958 --> 07:18.742
sorrow, famine...

07:18.916 --> 07:20.744
plagues--

07:20.918 --> 07:22.442
all the evil inside.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.356
So what's to keep
the new guardian

07:24.531 --> 07:26.010
from accidentally
doing the same,

07:26.184 --> 07:28.404
especially if she doesn't know
what's in the Box?

07:28.578 --> 07:30.188
Nothing.

07:34.932 --> 07:37.500
WOMAN:
Seriously,

07:37.674 --> 07:38.675
Darcy, it's all good.

07:38.849 --> 07:39.894
Stop stressing about him.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.722
I know, but
how can I not?

07:41.896 --> 07:43.680
We're supposed to
have this big talk.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.552
Mm.
I mean, what does
that mean, anyway?

07:45.726 --> 07:47.423
I was stupid to
fall for him.

07:47.597 --> 07:48.772
Oh, come on,
don't say that.

07:48.946 --> 07:49.773
I mean it.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.253
He's so not worth it.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.211
We got too much in life
to be happy about

07:53.385 --> 07:54.996
than to let Adam Bice
get you down.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.519
You're right.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.390
Mm-hmm.
As always.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.044
Oh, not always.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.959
You should check
my French Lit grades.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.308
Oh, that reminds me.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.746
Ugh, I'm totally missing
my Chem lecture.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.225
I got to go.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.009
Okay.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.880
[phone ringing]

08:10.054 --> 08:12.404
Wait!

08:12.579 --> 08:13.971
Oh, this is him. What do I do?

08:14.145 --> 08:15.625
Just be strong.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.367
Don't let him get to you,
no matter what he says.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.890
[sighs]

08:20.064 --> 08:21.718
Call me later.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.328
[phone continues ringing]

08:23.503 --> 08:24.547
[phone beeps on]

08:24.721 --> 08:26.201
Hello?

08:28.943 --> 08:32.337
[eerie, indistinct
voices whispering]

08:44.349 --> 08:46.830
[whispering continues]

08:48.658 --> 08:51.008

What the heck?!

09:10.898 --> 09:14.336
[eerie screeching]

09:20.603 --> 09:22.605
[intense ringing]

09:22.779 --> 09:23.867
[sighs]

09:24.041 --> 09:26.653
This is the global alert, Paige.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.611
One that only
a whitelighter can hear.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.787
You should be looking
at this as if it was a gift,

09:30.961 --> 09:32.441
rather than a problem.

09:32.615 --> 09:36.445
A problem for me is when
Leo rearranges my books here.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.926
I would classify this
as a root canal.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.449
Nevertheless,

09:40.623 --> 09:42.973
this is who you are,
who you have become.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.019
Well, I don't want to become it,
so fix it already!

09:45.193 --> 09:46.760
Fix it?

09:46.934 --> 09:49.676
Yeah, I don't think she
wants to hear the call ever.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.155
Well, that's impossible.

09:51.329 --> 09:52.330
She doesn't have a choice.

09:52.504 --> 09:53.897
It would be as if you

09:54.071 --> 09:55.595
wished to no longer breathe.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.814
If this ringing doesn't stop,
maybe I don't want to.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.642
Look, I just left
Magic School, okay?

09:59.816 --> 10:03.037
The last thing I want
to deal with is you Elders.

10:03.211 --> 10:06.127
I know, Paige, that in the past
we have had our differences,

10:06.301 --> 10:07.824
but becoming
a whitelighter

10:07.998 --> 10:10.435
is as natural a part
of your unfolding destiny

10:10.610 --> 10:12.786
as becoming a Charmed One.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.788
LEO:
Perhaps if you
explained to her

10:14.962 --> 10:16.354
why you called
the alert.

10:16.528 --> 10:17.921
We sensed a great threat,

10:18.095 --> 10:20.271
one which we have not yet
been able to isolate.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.752
That is why we need every
whitelighter to be vigilant.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.145
Well, not this whitelighter.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.799
Okay, just make it stop already.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.279
You know, maybe

10:28.453 --> 10:31.935
if Paige helped a
whitelighter-to-be instead?

10:32.109 --> 10:34.677
That's a possibility.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.113
Why, what would that do?

10:36.287 --> 10:38.899
Helping others helps yourself...

10:39.073 --> 10:41.597
to find some clarity.

10:43.773 --> 10:46.950
Well, if clarity makes
this noise stop...

10:47.124 --> 10:48.996
whatever, I'll try it.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.433
[moans]

10:56.656 --> 10:58.788
Come on, come on,
what's taking so long?

10:58.962 --> 11:00.747
Relax, or I'll give
you a time out.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.619
Here, maybe this will help.

11:09.712 --> 11:10.626
Wyatt...

11:10.800 --> 11:11.583
Time out

11:11.758 --> 11:12.759
means no magic.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.195
Scry now, parent later.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.544
Well, you know,
it would help

11:15.718 --> 11:16.719
if I wasn't the
only one around here

11:16.893 --> 11:17.894
who had to
discipline him.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.288
Let me do this.Please, we have

11:20.462 --> 11:22.029
to hurry.
If the Box has been opened,

11:22.203 --> 11:23.465
or if a demon's found it...

11:23.639 --> 11:25.249
We won't let that happen,
I promise.

11:25.423 --> 11:26.511
Look, we do this

11:26.686 --> 11:27.687
all the time.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.123
Maybe

11:29.297 --> 11:30.646
we need a stronger connection.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.909
I don't know what else to try.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.389
Oh...!

11:35.912 --> 11:37.871
UC Berkeley, it's on the campus.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.612
Whoa.

11:40.787 --> 11:41.526
Where are you going?

11:41.701 --> 11:44.268
You've done your jobs...

11:44.442 --> 11:45.748
now I have to go do mine.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.184
PIPER:
Wait, you saw where
that got you

11:47.358 --> 11:48.533
last time-- why don't you
let us go with you?

11:48.708 --> 11:49.926
I can't let you risk it.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.972
Well, we can't
let you risk it either,

11:52.146 --> 11:54.278
not as long as there's
a demon after that Box.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.020
All right.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.153
But I'll transport us there;
it'll be faster.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.242
What about the Elders?

12:01.416 --> 12:03.200
What about them?Well, I mean,

12:03.374 --> 12:05.768
it's Pandora's Box, we should
probably tell them something.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.465
All right, you tell 'em.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.424
Mommy needs a time out.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.126
[man and woman arguing]

12:16.300 --> 12:18.563
What's going on around here?
Something's not right.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.827
She must have
opened the Box.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.177
It's the first wave
of sorrow.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.135
I'm not going to pass,
my dad's going to...

12:25.309 --> 12:29.400
We have to hurry, before you
become affected too.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.058
WOMAN:
I just want to go home!

12:35.232 --> 12:35.885
I hate it here.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.366
HOPE:
No, Darcy,

12:38.540 --> 12:39.323
we talked about this.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.585
In there.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.891
He's not worth it.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.632
[knock on door]Just a minute.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.939
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

12:46.113 --> 12:47.201
Promise?

12:47.375 --> 12:48.637
I'll be right there.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.991
Can I help you?

12:55.165 --> 12:57.472
Hi, my name is Piper
and this is...

12:57.646 --> 12:58.865
this is Nina...

12:59.039 --> 13:00.605
and we wanted
to talk to you

13:00.780 --> 13:02.259
about something you

13:02.433 --> 13:05.132
received, I guess would
be a good word for it.

13:05.306 --> 13:08.875
Uh, look, whatever you're
selling, I'm not interested.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.094
My friend's in trouble,
and if I don't--You have come

13:11.268 --> 13:13.140
into possession of something
more powerful

13:13.314 --> 13:15.098
than anything
you have ever known.

13:15.272 --> 13:16.970
PIPER:
Yeah, okay see,

13:17.144 --> 13:19.450
I was going to go with the
less intimidating tactic but--

13:19.624 --> 13:20.495
What are you talking about?

13:20.669 --> 13:21.757
The Box.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.759
NINA:
Where is it?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.413
Uh...

13:37.251 --> 13:39.122
How did it come to you?

13:39.296 --> 13:41.559
I don't know,
it was just there.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.605
What is going on?

13:43.779 --> 13:45.868
What is the--You haven't, by any
chance, been taking

13:46.042 --> 13:47.783
some Greek mythology
classes, have you?

13:47.957 --> 13:49.306
Pandora's Box--

13:49.480 --> 13:50.699
a gift

13:50.873 --> 13:52.614
the gods gave to Prometheus--

13:52.788 --> 13:56.618
one that contained all of
the evils of the world...

13:56.792 --> 14:00.578
until Pandora unleashed them
on unsuspecting people.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.975
[Katya's voice]:
I hope to do the same.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.108
Aw, crap.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.763
PIPER:Oh, yeah, this
is not good.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.678
This is not good at all.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.551
This explains the global alert.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.466
Alert?
What are you talking about?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.816
The one that Paige heard--
and every other whitelighter.

14:20.990 --> 14:24.167
Pandora's Box exists
solely to tempt.

14:24.341 --> 14:25.690
It's part of the grand design.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.780
If mankind chooses
to open it again, so be it.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.434
But guardians

14:30.608 --> 14:33.394
are supposed to protect it
from being opened by demons.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.657
So, then we should be fine.
Piper and Nina--

14:35.831 --> 14:37.746
Nina never should have
let it out of her sight.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.749
Well, apparently, she
didn't have a choice.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.795
The Box moved on to its
next guardian by itself.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.667
But that's not possible.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.799
It can't move on unless the
prior guardian was already dead.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.978
Okay, you need to orb me
to Piper immediately.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.635
Piper? Where are you?

15:01.552 --> 15:03.380
Oh, thank God you're okay.

15:04.773 --> 15:05.905
Who is she?

15:06.079 --> 15:07.210
Meet Hope...

15:07.384 --> 15:09.604
the real guardian
of the Box.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.259
Too bad she doesn't have
anything left to guard.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.050
Who...

15:21.224 --> 15:22.747
who are you people?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.925
Okay, Hope, can you just try to
calm down a little bit?

15:26.099 --> 15:27.752
We're the good guys.
I swear.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.319
Oh, the good guys!
[nervous laugh]

15:29.493 --> 15:31.278
Oh, then what was she?

15:31.452 --> 15:33.236
She was a...

15:33.410 --> 15:34.542
A demon pretending to be...

15:34.716 --> 15:36.283
A guardian just like you.

15:36.457 --> 15:37.284
PHOEBE:
Yeah, uh,

15:37.458 --> 15:38.589
Nina's dead by the way.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.374
Yeah, I figured.Not now.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.505
You!

15:41.679 --> 15:42.942
You blew up my dorm!

15:43.116 --> 15:44.378
With your hands!

15:44.552 --> 15:47.598
Yes, and I am very
sorry about that.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.470
[scoffing]:
Oh. Huh.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.560
Now you're both calm, like this
kind of stuff happens every day.

15:52.734 --> 15:53.517
Well, it kind of does.

15:53.691 --> 15:54.866
You see, uh...

15:55.041 --> 15:57.913
we're witches.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.611
You're what?!

16:00.785 --> 16:02.831
We can explain all of this
in great detail

16:03.005 --> 16:04.485
much later,
but right now,

16:04.659 --> 16:06.008
we need to get you going.And fast.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.053
I'm feeling a little...

16:07.227 --> 16:08.402
Bummed?
Yeah, I know.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.926
Nina-- or Katya,
I'm assuming,

16:11.100 --> 16:13.711
said that it was the first wave
of sorrow from the Box.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.191
Great, so like
a little appetizer?

16:15.365 --> 16:16.801
And she's obviously
immune to it,

16:16.976 --> 16:18.629
'cause she seems
more freaked than bummed.

16:18.803 --> 16:19.717
Well, can you blame her?

16:19.891 --> 16:22.155
What are you two talking about?

16:22.329 --> 16:26.594
We just need to know one thing
that's kind of important.

16:26.768 --> 16:27.943
Did you open the Box?

16:28.117 --> 16:30.946
Only for a second.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.643
Some sort of
dust came out

16:32.817 --> 16:33.601
and then I shut it.

16:33.775 --> 16:34.732
Well, from the sounds

16:34.906 --> 16:35.951
of the dorm out there,

16:36.125 --> 16:36.996
I'd say it was
long enough.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.606
Shall we go?

16:38.780 --> 16:40.173
Oh, I am not going anywhere
with you people.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.218
You burst in here
talking about

16:42.392 --> 16:45.830
Pandora's Box and guardians and
witches and God knows what else,

16:46.005 --> 16:48.616
and now you expect me
to leave with you.

16:48.790 --> 16:52.620
Okay, look, I know
exactly how you feel.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.144
When we first found out

16:55.318 --> 16:57.320
we were witches,
it was really scary because...

16:57.494 --> 17:00.280
well, we didn't have
anyone to guide us.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.847
But we could help you.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.460
You just have to come with us.

17:15.382 --> 17:16.992
Are you sure
you don't want me

17:17.166 --> 17:18.341
to go down there
with you?

17:18.515 --> 17:20.343
I'm fine, Dad.Well, remember, go

17:20.517 --> 17:21.779
straight to Mommy, okay?

17:21.953 --> 17:22.780
She's waiting for you
in the lobby.

17:22.954 --> 17:23.912
[whining]:
Dad...

17:24.913 --> 17:26.828
Hey, hold the doors.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.962
Thanks a lot.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.449
I saw you on my way up,
like, an hour ago.

17:39.623 --> 17:43.062
Yeah, I've been looking
for someone.

17:46.935 --> 17:50.373
[electricity buzzing,
loud banging and crashing]

17:50.547 --> 17:51.461
What's happening?

17:54.247 --> 17:56.858
TREY:
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.820
What? You're going to
blame me for this too?

18:02.994 --> 18:05.171
How dare you even imply
that's part of my agenda?

18:05.345 --> 18:06.607
I'm just standing here.I'm not, it has
nothing to do

18:06.781 --> 18:08.261
with what
your agenda is.I'm scared.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.001
It's okay.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.614
Oh, my God, the ringing stopped.
That means...

18:17.270 --> 18:18.749
...it's one of you.

18:19.968 --> 18:22.971
Uh... you... we stopped.

18:27.454 --> 18:28.629
KATYA:
If my powers

18:28.803 --> 18:30.065
couldn't open the Box,

18:30.239 --> 18:32.850
what would make you
think you could?

18:33.024 --> 18:34.852
Hey, at least
I didn't let the guardian go.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.769
There must be a way.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.293
Well, at least now that
we've got it,

18:40.467 --> 18:42.295
she can't put the sorrow
she let out back in.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.124
Yeah, but
she didn't let out enough.

18:45.298 --> 18:49.911
Within lies the power
to destroy cities,

18:50.085 --> 18:52.435
crumble empires...

18:52.609 --> 18:55.960
devastate all that
is good in the world.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.093
All this just
to impress Zankou?

18:58.267 --> 18:59.225
[grunts]

18:59.399 --> 19:00.878
Hey, just asking.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.967
For too long
I've had to

19:03.142 --> 19:05.361
watch lesser
demons rewarded;

19:05.535 --> 19:08.582
been denied my proper place
in the forefront.

19:08.756 --> 19:15.458
No, Zankou will no longer be
able to deny me after this.

19:15.632 --> 19:16.677
Why don't you just

19:16.851 --> 19:18.113
shape-shift into
the guardian?

19:19.245 --> 19:20.811
Taking the physical form

19:20.985 --> 19:22.813
of a guardian
doesn't make me one.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.468
No, it will know.

19:25.642 --> 19:26.774
Then what are you going to do?

19:26.948 --> 19:30.430
I'll make her open it for me.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.739
There's nothing
in The Book on Katya

19:35.913 --> 19:37.524
and scrying for the Box
did not work.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.569
Well, maybe we should
try Magic School.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.005
What... wait.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.268
Magic School?

19:42.442 --> 19:43.486
What is that?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.184
LEO:
It's a

19:45.358 --> 19:46.315
place where you can learn
more about your gifts.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.665
Are you a witch too?

19:48.839 --> 19:50.189
PIPER:
No, he's a...

19:50.363 --> 19:52.365
he's... he's a long story.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.410
One that worked out well.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.804
This is all so... complicated.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.328
Look, I know this is
really hard to understand

19:59.502 --> 20:00.938
but this is what you're meant

20:01.112 --> 20:02.026
to do.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.028
No, I'm meant to finish

20:04.203 --> 20:06.030
school, party,
to have fun.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.643
I don't even know if
I believe in magic.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.298
[gasping]:Oh...

20:12.472 --> 20:14.561
Where did he come from?

20:14.735 --> 20:16.084
Uh... uh, sorry.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.738
He's not supposed to do
that without permission.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.783
Don't scare
the pretty girl, okay?

20:19.957 --> 20:21.481
LEO:
Okay, pal, listen,

20:21.655 --> 20:22.873
why don't you take
Wuvey upstairs

20:23.047 --> 20:24.875
for a little nap, okay?

20:25.049 --> 20:26.703
[anxiously]:Oh...

20:26.877 --> 20:28.792
I'm getting
out of here.Hope, wait.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.316
Look, there's nothing
that I can say

20:30.490 --> 20:31.752
that's going to make
this any better.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.057
Can't you just

20:33.232 --> 20:34.363
make up a spell
or something?

20:34.537 --> 20:36.583
Sometimes I wish I could.

20:36.757 --> 20:40.456
But then I realized
all of this, you know,

20:40.630 --> 20:43.720
the good and the bad...
makes me who I am.

20:43.894 --> 20:44.939
You know?

20:45.113 --> 20:46.462
[cell phone rings]Oh.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.683
It's my friend Darcy.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.162
I have to help her.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.686
You know, you could

You'd think there'd be

important than this?

24:19.283 --> 24:20.807
Globally, nothing.

24:20.981 --> 24:23.287
Personally, I need him to
wrangle Wyatt for a day,

24:23.462 --> 24:25.289
so he can see what
I'm talking about.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.204
Piper, you know what Wyatt

24:27.378 --> 24:29.206
is going through
is completely normal.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.295
No, temper tantrums are normal.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.384
Uncontrollable crying is normal.

24:33.559 --> 24:36.083
Orbing all over town
is not normal.

He's not orbing all over town.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.130
Not yet.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.437
Look, it's not that I have
a problem with him being magical

24:42.611 --> 24:44.918
because if I did, I would have
bound his powers at birth.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.963
It's just that he needs to learn

24:47.137 --> 24:49.183
that he can't use his powers
whenever he wants to.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.751
And... Leo needs
to understand that, too.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.187
Well, I think he does.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.754
I just think he deals
with it differently.

24:54.928 --> 24:57.321
Well, we'll see how
Mr. Mom deals with it

24:57.496 --> 24:59.062
after he's been
chasing around the kid,

24:59.236 --> 25:00.455
now that Leo can't orb.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.413
You guys will figure it out.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.939
You know, you have been much
more optimistic lately.

25:07.244 --> 25:09.420
Yeah, I guess I have... hope.

about that the hard way.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.614

25:28.788 --> 25:30.137
then she went rogue.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.922
How very enterprising of her.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.708
She probably just wants
to make a name for herself.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.623
Why is it that every demon

25:37.797 --> 25:40.582
who is trying to make a name
for themself has to go

25:40.756 --> 25:42.192
and try to end the world?

25:42.366 --> 25:45.195
Why don't we ponder that fact
while we scry for her?

25:45.369 --> 25:47.502
Well, even if
we find her,

25:47.676 --> 25:48.851
we have no way of getting there.

25:49.025 --> 25:50.331
We're short an orber.

25:50.505 --> 25:53.334
Well, we'll have
to come up with something.

25:53.508 --> 25:54.901
I mean, this place

25:55.075 --> 25:57.512
is called Magic School
for a reason, right?

26:01.603 --> 26:03.257

26:16.923 --> 26:18.838
Isn't she?

26:19.012 --> 26:21.928

a pawn in all this.

at the bottom of the Box.

How are the ears?

Better, thank you.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.009
It was pretty risky of you

sending me off to help
a future whitelighter.

39:21.489 --> 39:22.229
Was it?

39:22.403 --> 39:23.622
Yes.

39:23.796 --> 39:24.840
We almost didn't get
Pandora's Box.

39:25.014 --> 39:26.059
But you did get it back.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.061
Yes.

39:28.235 --> 39:29.802
Which proves that you can handle
both your Charmed

39:29.976 --> 39:31.107
and your whitelighter
responsibilities.

39:31.281 --> 39:32.587
I don't see what
that has to do...

39:32.761 --> 39:34.197
Didn't it make you
feel so proud,

39:34.372 --> 39:34.894
accomplishing what you did
in that elevator?

39:35.068 --> 39:36.678
Of course I did.

39:36.852 --> 39:38.550
And you did it all by yourself,
without your sisters.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.945
Maybe this is what you have been
searching for, Paige--

39:43.119 --> 39:44.904
your separate identity.

39:45.078 --> 39:47.602
Being a whitelighter can
give you that and much more.

39:47.776 --> 39:48.603
Like what?

39:48.777 --> 39:50.605
Fulfillment.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.302
You're a natural, Paige.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.217
Everything you've
been and done

39:54.392 --> 39:56.524
in your life has been preparing
you to be a whitelighter.

39:56.698 --> 39:59.005
Everything you needed
to help those people

39:59.179 --> 40:00.615
has been inside of you
all along.

40:00.789 --> 40:04.053
Well, it did feel good
to save them.

40:04.227 --> 40:07.143
Then don't fight that,
embrace it.

40:07.317 --> 40:10.756
Not for me, not for the Elders,
but for yourself.

40:13.236 --> 40:14.629
Think about it?

40:17.589 --> 40:19.155
Wait.

40:20.766 --> 40:23.899
Just out of curiosity,

40:24.073 --> 40:26.554
who was the future whitelighter
I was supposed to save?

40:28.600 --> 40:29.775
You were.

[chuckles]

40:40.525 --> 40:42.788
[laughs]

40:47.488 --> 40:49.577
So how was your day?

40:49.751 --> 40:51.405
Very funny.

40:51.579 --> 40:52.885
[Leo chuckles]

40:53.059 --> 40:54.713
Actually, it was...
it was all right.

40:54.887 --> 40:57.933
It calmed down a bit once,
uh, Wyatt tried to orb a toy

40:58.107 --> 40:59.108
to himself and hit himself

40:59.282 --> 41:00.762
in the head.Oh, no.

41:00.936 --> 41:03.069
It's okay, it was
just a little bump.

41:03.243 --> 41:06.681
But it was enough to teach him
that he shouldn't do it again.

41:06.855 --> 41:08.422
Is that your way of telling me

41:08.596 --> 41:11.294
that magical boys will be
magical boys again?

41:13.340 --> 41:14.254
No.

41:14.428 --> 41:16.299
You know, we both

41:16.474 --> 41:18.693
need to teach him when and where
to use his powers.

41:18.867 --> 41:19.955
Though it's not gonna be easy.

41:20.129 --> 41:22.958
And on the other hand,

41:23.132 --> 41:25.744
we do need to realize
that he is who he is.

41:25.918 --> 41:29.574
And even though
I want a normal family,

41:29.748 --> 41:31.227
I don't want it
at the expense of

41:31.401 --> 41:32.402
them finding
their own identities.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.666
Well, uh, Chris here

41:34.840 --> 41:36.363
is gonna be coming
into his powers shortly.

nuts around here.

As opposed to what?

41:40.410 --> 41:41.847

41:43.544 --> 41:46.939
We'll deal with it
as it comes, together.

41:47.113 --> 41:49.768
And until then...

41:49.942 --> 41:51.378
why don't you show Mommy
