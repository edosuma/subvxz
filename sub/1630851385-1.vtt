Buddha be praised.

02:41.449 --> 02:43.034
We've been expecting you.

[swords clinking]

03:34.419 --> 03:41.342
[wooden knocker knocking]

03:41.426 --> 03:44.512
I can read your mind,
your action.

03:47.765 --> 03:50.268
You want to know
how good your Kong Fu is.

03:53.605 --> 03:54.898
[sigh]

03:56.107 --> 03:59.444
You have to find the answer.
You may go.

04:04.657 --> 04:06.367
[door cracks]

04:07.493 --> 04:08.536
[sword crash]

04:12.624 --> 04:13.708
[master] Stop!

04:52.956 --> 04:55.750
[sparking]

04:55.834 --> 05:02.799
[bombs explode]

05:12.100 --> 05:16.104
To the dead,
winning and losing mean nothing.

05:16.479 --> 05:19.899
Those Japanese warriors
squandered their lives
this evening.

05:20.900 --> 05:24.946
The poor souls,
may Buddha bless them.

05:25.363 --> 05:28.491
Holiness,
I admire those Ninja warriors.

05:29.325 --> 05:30.493
They were dedicated.

05:30.994 --> 05:33.621
They attacked our monastery
knowing they would die.

05:34.497 --> 05:39.085
Sorry to say,
but Chinese fighters,
they lack such devotion.

05:39.335 --> 05:42.297
Qingyun, what about yourself?

05:42.338 --> 05:45.341
Are you dedicated?
Can you fight this duel?

05:45.592 --> 05:48.219
Master, I've trained for yours.

05:48.845 --> 05:51.139
I'm ready.
It's time to test myself.

05:52.015 --> 05:53.099
Hmm.

05:53.183 --> 05:57.979
[master] Buddha be praised.
You must think carefully.

05:58.813 --> 06:00.690
A duel is not
the only way to win.

06:02.358 --> 06:03.401
Don't forget.

06:03.776 --> 06:07.488
Kong Fu develops our minds
as well as our bodies.

06:07.614 --> 06:09.282
I'm afraid
I don't agree with you.

06:09.824 --> 06:12.994
You are a scholar,
you have very different ideas.

06:13.161 --> 06:16.998
We are warrior monks,
the duel is the only way
to get their respect.

06:17.457 --> 06:23.171
It will be a duel to his death,
but Qingyun has learned
all he can from us.

06:23.296 --> 06:26.424
He's earned the right
to test his skills in battle.

06:27.133 --> 06:29.177
Thank you, sir, I appreciate it.

06:29.719 --> 06:33.556
It's true that the Japanese
are desperate to win
the title of the best fighter.

06:33.681 --> 06:36.643
But I am also determined to
defend the good name of Shaolin.

06:37.852 --> 06:41.022
You are not just concerned
with defeating the Japanese.

06:41.147 --> 06:43.900
You are determined to
win that title as well.

07:56.764 --> 08:02.312
[bell ringing]

08:32.842 --> 08:35.053
Welcome to
the Shaolin Monastery.

08:36.638 --> 08:37.722
Please.

08:43.561 --> 08:46.272
[priest] I must say China
is a wonderful country.

08:46.564 --> 08:49.609
[priest] Her influence is quite
far and wide across the world.

08:49.692 --> 08:51.277
[priest] You should be proud.

08:51.736 --> 08:53.404
[master] You are too kind, sir.

08:53.696 --> 08:55.114
[master] But you flatter us.

08:58.243 --> 09:02.872
[priest] Take Shaolin Kung Fu
for instance, it's famous
but conservative.

09:02.997 --> 09:04.707
And it's admired in tradition.

09:05.333 --> 09:08.920
I think you'll find modern
Japanese martial arts
are far superior.

09:09.462 --> 09:11.214
[master]
I am afraid I don't agree.

09:11.464 --> 09:16.010
[master] It's an established
fact that Shaolin Kung Fu is the
world's greatest martial art.

09:17.095 --> 09:22.016
[master] We've been experts for
centuries now and our technique
has done nothing but improve.

09:22.225 --> 09:26.145
[master] I don't believe
your fighters can ever defeat
the students of Shaolin.

09:26.521 --> 09:30.275
[priest] Well, it is said
that Shaolin Kung Fu
has 72 techniques.

09:30.817 --> 09:34.153
[priest] That's very impressive.
You have great traditions.

09:34.445 --> 09:37.282
I'm sure that once you're forced
to be reckoned with.

09:37.615 --> 09:41.327
But I doubt your students
today are the same before.

09:41.494 --> 09:46.457
[master] But Shaolin we use
ours purely for defense
and to enhance our minds.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.793
[master] We do not
seek fame or fortune.

09:50.170 --> 09:53.131
I see.
You think you are
smarter than us.

09:53.965 --> 09:56.050
We are not mindless fighters,
you know?

09:59.012 --> 10:02.599
Hmm. The first settlers
in Japan were Chinese.

10:02.724 --> 10:04.100
So really, we are brothers.

10:04.517 --> 10:06.853
We're all one
under the same sun.

10:07.020 --> 10:10.857
[master] We should not
be fighting each other.
We should be living in harmony.

10:11.232 --> 10:14.235
[master] Why must we always
have these contests of strength?

10:16.154 --> 10:17.947
[priest] I understand
what you say.

10:18.239 --> 10:22.785
But if this was my country,
your theories would never
be accepted.

10:23.620 --> 10:27.832
But that's enough talk.
Why don't you show me
what you are capable of?

10:28.166 --> 10:32.837
I'm not a good fighter,
nor am I the official
Chinese representative.

10:33.338 --> 10:34.923
Perhaps another day.

10:35.673 --> 10:38.134
We'll let the younger men
prove themselves.

10:44.182 --> 10:49.020
Experts, you call yourselves
experts, yet none of you
dare to fight me.

10:53.399 --> 10:59.948
Hmm, look at you, hiding behind
that beard, you are a coward,
aren't you?

11:01.699 --> 11:02.909
You disappoint me.

11:03.868 --> 11:04.911
So be it.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.626
[cane ringing and falls]

11:13.211 --> 11:14.254
Ah!

11:14.337 --> 11:20.593
[fighting]

11:31.855 --> 11:32.856
[robe rips]

11:35.984 --> 11:37.068
Pardon me.

11:43.324 --> 11:45.034
[master] Buddha be praised.

11:45.618 --> 11:49.122
You have fought very well,
and indeed are an expert.

11:49.581 --> 11:52.292
You flatter me.
Thank you, master.

11:53.293 --> 11:56.880
I was lucky.
I am really not
such a great fighter.

11:58.673 --> 12:00.925
I was just fortunate
to win today.

12:01.801 --> 12:03.178
Fate was on my side.

12:04.804 --> 12:08.308
Brother,
we monks shouldn't fight.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.852
We mustn't treat
our guest this way.

12:15.315 --> 12:17.859
Our representative
is Hashimotocada.

12:17.942 --> 12:20.653
He is by far
the best fighter in Japan.

12:21.362 --> 12:25.700
He is ready.
He will be waiting for your man
at the Holy Sort House.

12:26.618 --> 12:27.702
Please excuse me.

12:31.331 --> 12:33.333
[master] Buddha be praised.

12:44.761 --> 12:49.349
Well, Qingyun, you surprised
that Japanese priest
with your strength.

12:49.641 --> 12:51.059
I think you impressed him.

12:51.351 --> 12:53.853
I wanted to teach
that arrogant swine a lesson.

12:54.479 --> 12:56.397
We shouldn't
have treated him so well.

12:56.481 --> 12:58.525
It made him think
we were afraid of him.

12:59.275 --> 13:00.860
That's why I stepped in, sir.

13:01.110 --> 13:03.029
I knew you wanted me
to do something.

13:03.905 --> 13:06.741
Well done,
you must have read my mind.

13:06.741 --> 13:07.909
[chuckles]

13:07.992 --> 13:12.247
Master, you are like my father.
So believe me,
I know your thoughts.

13:14.749 --> 13:19.796
Qingyun, I hope that when the
day comes, you'll be able to
beat this man, Hashimoto.

13:24.175 --> 13:25.218
I hope so.

13:25.343 --> 13:26.344
I leave at dawn.

13:28.930 --> 13:31.724
You must bid farewell
to your master before you go.

13:41.901 --> 13:48.908
[kids laughing]

13:50.201 --> 13:51.244
[chuckles]

13:51.578 --> 13:57.500
[kids scream]
[swords clink]

14:14.225 --> 14:16.769
[bang]
Ah!

14:17.437 --> 14:19.397
You idiot!
Why did you hit me so hard?

14:19.439 --> 14:20.607
Hey, I didn't mean it.

14:20.648 --> 14:22.525
You liar, you went
right for the head.

14:22.650 --> 14:23.818
- I did not.
- You did.

14:23.943 --> 14:26.696
Because you are
a lousy fighter, that's why.
[man calls]

14:26.779 --> 14:27.864
- Says who?
- Says me.

14:29.032 --> 14:30.033
Huh?

14:31.492 --> 14:32.535
Yes, sir.

14:35.955 --> 14:38.124
Hey, look.
The chicken is getting help.

14:38.416 --> 14:39.959
[kids mocking]

14:40.502 --> 14:41.753
Come on, chicken.

14:42.212 --> 14:43.296
Alright?

14:43.546 --> 14:44.631
Thank you, sir.

14:44.672 --> 14:49.844
[kids mocking]

14:49.928 --> 14:55.058
[kids yelling]
Come on, fight! Fight him!

15:04.275 --> 15:05.610
[kid] Who is chicken, now?

15:13.076 --> 15:16.871
Mister, I just beat him.
Thanks for your help.

15:16.955 --> 15:19.207
[kid] Bye.

15:59.831 --> 16:00.874
Honorable General.

16:00.957 --> 16:04.002
[Hashimoto] Hashimotocada
of Riosan, is at your service.

16:04.335 --> 16:06.004
You'd better win this duel.

16:06.045 --> 16:08.882
Our country's reputation
lies in your hands.

16:09.424 --> 16:11.926
I shall not
disappoint you, General.
I shall win.

16:14.262 --> 16:17.015
Then make sure you
put this sword to good use.

16:17.348 --> 16:18.516
Sir!

16:23.605 --> 16:24.647
Thank you, General.

16:39.579 --> 16:42.248

17:55.530 --> 17:58.658

18:00.159 --> 18:01.202
Dance!

18:01.244 --> 18:07.125
[friends cheering]

18:09.961 --> 18:16.759
[Hashimoto singing]

18:29.814 --> 18:35.778
[crowd yell] Come on! Cheers!
Cheers! Cheers!

18:37.280 --> 18:39.824
[crowd panic] Master!

18:40.658 --> 18:45.079
I drink to your victory
and to the glory
you'll bring our school.

18:45.997 --> 18:46.998
Sir.

18:50.793 --> 18:51.836
Hmm.

18:53.254 --> 18:54.339
Hmm.

19:02.764 --> 19:04.516
Here, drink.

19:07.310 --> 19:08.520
To victory!

19:08.603 --> 19:10.563
[crowd cheering]
To victory!

19:10.688 --> 19:11.814
Come drink with me.

19:11.856 --> 19:17.904
[party continues]

19:18.446 --> 19:23.910
[friend yelling] Hey, wait!
Don't go! Come back!

19:31.918 --> 19:34.546
It's time to go home, boys.
Next time.

19:35.088 --> 19:36.089
I'll see you later.

19:36.840 --> 19:41.970
[Hashimoto laughs]

19:58.361 --> 19:59.404
[spooky music]

20:05.910 --> 20:09.163
[fighting]

20:09.247 --> 20:10.290
Who are you?

20:23.052 --> 20:24.137
Ah.

20:24.137 --> 20:26.055
[sword stabs]

20:26.139 --> 20:27.182
Ah!

20:27.849 --> 20:30.393
[master grunts in pain]

20:36.733 --> 20:38.026
[master grunts]

20:38.109 --> 20:40.028
[gasp] Master?

20:45.366 --> 20:46.910
Do not grieve for me.

20:47.911 --> 20:50.955
It's a warrior's honor
to die in combat.

20:51.414 --> 20:52.457
Yes.

20:53.958 --> 20:58.379
Remember, you must fight
for the glory of our school.

20:58.630 --> 21:00.006
Never surrender.

21:01.716 --> 21:04.719
Recite the code to me.
Say it now.

21:04.719 --> 21:05.762
Yes.

21:07.472 --> 21:11.351
Fight to win, never be afraid.
Be ruthless, be merciless.

21:14.479 --> 21:18.566
Be resourceful.
Kill anyone
who gets in your way.

21:19.776 --> 21:22.987
Your own brother,
even God himself.

21:23.821 --> 21:30.537
Show no pity.
The strong will survive;
The weak deserve to death.

21:31.287 --> 21:34.999
Always remember these words
and you will always succeed.

21:35.708 --> 21:38.253
Look death in the face
and show no fear.

21:38.378 --> 21:41.130
For to be a warrior
means to fight until death.

21:42.507 --> 21:44.759
It is the ultimate honor.

22:27.010 --> 22:28.136
[door opens]

23:03.546 --> 23:08.968
[birds chirping]

23:19.312 --> 23:20.688
Dragon!

23:21.564 --> 23:22.649
Dragon!

23:23.191 --> 23:24.234
Dragon!

23:29.948 --> 23:31.282
Dragon, where is he?

23:31.366 --> 23:38.164
[Man laughing]

23:38.248 --> 23:40.250
[master] You better catch me.

23:40.708 --> 23:42.544
[master moaning]

23:42.627 --> 23:44.629
[bird yells] Served you right.

23:44.712 --> 23:46.214
- Hello.
- Served you right.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.466
Huh? You are dead.

23:49.259 --> 23:50.510
[bird shrills]

23:52.846 --> 23:54.389
You'd better stop teasing him.

23:55.098 --> 23:58.184
[master crying]
You are going to pay for that.

23:58.601 --> 24:00.061
No!

24:00.728 --> 24:02.188
I told you to catch me.

24:02.313 --> 24:03.356
What are you? Deaf?

24:03.439 --> 24:05.358
But you told me
never to listen to you.

24:05.483 --> 24:06.568
So I ignored you.

24:06.651 --> 24:08.903
Ah. He is a moron.

24:09.529 --> 24:11.865
Hey, what do you
want from me, huh?

24:11.906 --> 24:12.949
Oh, nothing at all.

24:13.116 --> 24:16.536
I came to see Dragon,
not my senile Kung Fu master.

24:16.661 --> 24:19.163
- Oh, you are so cruel.
- Be careful!

24:19.247 --> 24:21.958
I am still young.
Those monks are the senile ones.

24:22.083 --> 24:23.585
Dragon, get over here.

24:27.130 --> 24:28.548
I am not senile, am I?

24:28.673 --> 24:30.550
Not yet, but you are close.

24:30.633 --> 24:32.802
What?
You are fired.

24:33.178 --> 24:34.888
[screams]

24:36.014 --> 24:38.308
I bet you can't do that.
[chuckles]

24:39.517 --> 24:41.769
I am leaving,
take care of Dragon.

24:42.061 --> 24:43.479
- [master] Huh?
- [Qingyun sighs]

24:47.358 --> 24:52.322
Listen to me, if you lose
that duel, I won't speak
to you again, got it?

24:53.364 --> 24:56.951
If I lose the duel,
I won't be alive
to talk about it.

24:57.327 --> 24:59.746
But if I am still alive,
then I'll see you later.

25:03.583 --> 25:07.754
Hey, wait a minute, are you
sure those monks taught you
everything you need to know?

25:08.588 --> 25:10.632
You tell me,
you put me in there.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.093
Still holding that against me?

25:14.177 --> 25:15.220
I was just a kid.

25:15.762 --> 25:17.138
You had potential.

25:17.222 --> 25:20.850
I gave you a chance to
become a Kung Fu hero.
Now look at you.

25:20.975 --> 25:22.310
You are fighting for China.

25:22.435 --> 25:24.395
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.
- You shut up.

25:24.479 --> 25:26.147
So what?
You think you saved me?

25:26.231 --> 25:28.149
Yes, you should be
honored I chose you.

25:28.274 --> 25:30.860
And now I have to fight
because you think I owe you.

25:30.944 --> 25:32.278
No, no, of course not.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.988
You are fighting
for your country.

25:34.113 --> 25:36.074
No. I am fighting
for your stupid pride.

25:37.158 --> 25:38.451
Dragon, let's go.

25:41.538 --> 25:44.249
Fine, you stay up there,
you damn bird.

25:44.958 --> 25:46.501
To hell with the both of you.

25:46.584 --> 25:49.045
I have no time for
ungrateful students.

25:49.838 --> 25:54.259
- [maser laughs]
- [bird] You idiot, sucker!

25:54.342 --> 25:55.760
- Me what?
- Master!

25:56.094 --> 25:58.054
Ah!
[head bangs]

25:58.388 --> 25:59.889
Ah [laughs]

26:00.223 --> 26:04.352
[master screams]
- Master, are you hurt?
- Don't touch me.

26:04.435 --> 26:06.020
Don't call me your master.

26:06.104 --> 26:07.188
Master.

26:08.439 --> 26:09.983
I will win the duel, I promise.

26:14.904 --> 26:18.032
Dragon, you take good
care of him for me.

26:24.205 --> 26:25.331
Good luck.

26:30.128 --> 26:32.714
[bird quacking] Hey, quiet.

26:34.883 --> 26:40.972
[people celebrating festival]

27:01.451 --> 27:06.331
Hashimoto, I've come to prove
that the Japanese Samurai sword
is mightier than Chinese Kungfu.

27:06.456 --> 27:07.582
[laughs]

27:08.416 --> 27:11.544
I am Lichi Wang,
the Lord of the Sword.
You'll never beat me.

27:28.770 --> 27:31.648
Look, I'm the Lord
of The Toy Sword.
[man laughs]

27:31.773 --> 27:34.108
Don't touch my stuff.
Get away from here.

27:35.026 --> 27:36.277
Go on, get lost.

27:36.361 --> 27:37.445
No Japs are allowed.

27:38.947 --> 27:41.616
Your stinking yen
isn't welcome around here.

28:00.760 --> 28:04.973
[crowd applauding]

28:08.726 --> 28:11.688
- Welcome, there're tables
upstairs.
- Yeah, thanks.

28:13.106 --> 28:14.274
[woman cheering]

28:24.450 --> 28:26.452
Come on, man.
Hurry up, old man.

28:26.786 --> 28:27.829
We want to see it.

28:27.912 --> 28:30.331
Hold your horses.
I am nearly finished!

28:37.672 --> 28:42.719
Okay, finished.
[man laughing]

28:43.386 --> 28:47.473
The Lord of The Sword.
[man chuckling]

28:47.515 --> 28:50.185
That doesn't look
a bit like him.
You got it all wrong.

28:50.268 --> 28:55.648
Huh? What do you know?
You haven't met him, have you?

28:55.690 --> 28:57.609
It's a spitting image.

28:57.901 --> 29:01.905
Look at the beard
and those eyes. It's perfect.

29:02.405 --> 29:07.952
Don't listen to him.
The Lord of The Sword himself
asked me to paint this picture.

29:09.954 --> 29:14.667
Hey, you think that this guy
Hashimoto would have any chance
to get the Lord of The Sword?

29:15.001 --> 29:18.046
Oh, yes, definitely.
He is Japan's best fighter.

29:18.379 --> 29:19.923
He'll be as tough as nails.

29:20.715 --> 29:23.635
That's why I am going
to Holy Sword House
to see this duel.

29:24.219 --> 29:26.179
That's great!
Can I come too?

29:26.262 --> 29:29.557
Come on, I'm sure
they'd let me come
as your guest, wouldn't they?

29:32.018 --> 29:35.063
Forget about it,
very few invitations
were sent out.

29:35.688 --> 29:37.148
Only 30, in fact.

29:37.232 --> 29:39.817
But we were lucky,
we got the last two.

29:41.277 --> 29:43.404
Hey, we'll bring
you back a souvenir.

29:43.530 --> 29:47.617
[man laughs]
That's great! Drink up!

29:47.700 --> 29:48.743
Cheers!

29:55.750 --> 29:58.670
Hashimoto, surrender now,
or I'll cut you like a fish.

29:59.337 --> 30:00.797
We warriors never surrender.

30:00.797 --> 30:02.298
I'll peel you like a banana.

30:03.675 --> 30:05.426
So be it.
Prepare to die.

30:16.271 --> 30:19.399
- Peel, peel.
- Cut, cut.

30:23.695 --> 30:24.737
Thanks.

30:40.837 --> 30:43.214
What should I do now,
my friends?

30:45.508 --> 30:46.718
Very well.

30:50.555 --> 30:54.267
[crowd laughing and cheering]

30:57.478 --> 30:59.480
Thank you.
Thank you, my friends.

30:59.606 --> 31:00.940
Thank you all.

31:00.940 --> 31:02.108
Thank you all.

31:04.194 --> 31:07.030
Ah!
[stage falls]

31:10.617 --> 31:11.993
[wife] God!
They killed him.

31:12.368 --> 31:13.828
They killed my husband.

31:13.870 --> 31:17.373
[wife crying]

31:19.667 --> 31:20.752
Stay back.

31:26.758 --> 31:29.511
[wife crying]

31:29.636 --> 31:32.430
You murdered that man,
you'll pay for that.

31:35.141 --> 31:40.230
[men laughing]

31:40.355 --> 31:41.606
An eye for an eye.

31:45.151 --> 31:46.903
Madam, take this.

31:53.284 --> 31:55.662
Why did they kill him?
He's done nothing wrong.

31:57.455 --> 32:04.045
[men laughing]

32:06.673 --> 32:10.510

32:21.729 --> 32:24.023
[crowd applauding]

32:24.107 --> 32:25.692
Please help her with the body.

32:31.114 --> 32:33.032
That sword will
only bring you trouble.

33:19.704 --> 33:24.792
[horse grunts]

33:32.425 --> 33:33.551
[horse neighs]

33:47.482 --> 33:49.192
You must be Hashimotocada.

33:51.653 --> 33:52.862
I wish to fight you.

33:53.655 --> 33:55.532
I have only
one opponent in China.

33:56.032 --> 33:57.033
And that's me!

34:29.524 --> 34:31.192
A warrior does not fight women.

34:34.027 --> 34:35.112
Eh!

35:00.305 --> 35:01.890
[footsteps]

35:15.153 --> 35:16.571
You must be Kenji San.

35:17.071 --> 35:18.114
Hmm.

35:18.281 --> 35:21.159
I've been sent to accompany
you to Holy Sword House.

35:21.868 --> 35:22.911
Thank you.

35:23.995 --> 35:25.747
Do you know
who you are fighting?

35:26.247 --> 35:27.749
The Lord of The Sword.

35:28.708 --> 35:31.044
Tell me honestly,
can you beat him?

35:34.464 --> 35:38.176
I will destroy the man.
It is my sworn duty.

35:43.181 --> 35:46.184
[waves crash]

35:57.820 --> 36:03.785
[water splashing]

36:32.146 --> 36:38.278
[fighting]

36:49.372 --> 36:50.373
[Qingyun] Ah!

36:56.379 --> 37:03.052
[smoke whooshing]

37:43.134 --> 37:44.177
That'll be alright.

37:45.094 --> 37:46.638
Ah, I'll live.

37:51.351 --> 37:52.852
Your sword play is excellent.

37:54.270 --> 37:55.313
You are very brave.

37:58.858 --> 38:01.277
No, I made a fool of myself
out there.

38:01.528 --> 38:02.820
I saw you out there.

38:03.112 --> 38:04.531
You fought like a lion.

38:25.093 --> 38:26.678
Can you get me more firewood?

38:38.606 --> 38:42.735
Uh... I am a little curious,
why are you disguised?

38:43.903 --> 38:44.946
I am sorry.

38:45.655 --> 38:46.990
You didn't fool me, Miss.

38:48.867 --> 38:49.951
Hmm!

39:52.847 --> 39:55.350
[door opens]

40:09.989 --> 40:12.408
[priest] How odd!
Can you explain this?

40:12.534 --> 40:16.037
[priest] For some reason,
the Chinese seem to
worship the plum blossom.

40:16.621 --> 40:21.042
The plum blossom is small.
I suppose it's symbolic
of their stature.

40:21.835 --> 40:23.586
[Qingyun] You're not even close.

40:23.586 --> 40:24.629
Hmm?

40:24.754 --> 40:27.632
Although the plum tree is small,
it is a very steady plant.

40:27.757 --> 40:30.134
And it could endure
the hardships of the winters.

40:30.260 --> 40:33.346
In fact, it's an
excellent reflection
of the Chinese character.

40:35.557 --> 40:39.561
Now tell me,
your national emblem,
what is it?

40:42.689 --> 40:43.731
My friend.

40:46.192 --> 40:47.819
Ours is the cherry blossom.

40:48.152 --> 40:51.781
Although it's short-lived,
it leaves an everlasting
impression.

40:52.949 --> 40:54.325
And it is never forgotten.

40:55.285 --> 40:57.453
I see, well said.

40:58.496 --> 40:59.497
Hmm.

41:11.676 --> 41:12.677
Master Lee.

41:15.054 --> 41:16.055
Master Kada.

41:16.222 --> 41:17.307
Hmm?

41:24.772 --> 41:28.818
Allow me, this young man
is Master Han Sheng.

41:29.485 --> 41:30.570
We've met before.

41:30.612 --> 41:31.696
Hmm?

41:31.946 --> 41:32.989
Hmm?

41:38.578 --> 41:40.371
My father is waiting
in the garden.

41:41.039 --> 41:42.081
Come.

42:28.795 --> 42:30.755
Father,
Your guests have arrived.

42:35.927 --> 42:37.220
Welcome to you, gentlemen.

42:38.221 --> 42:39.806
It's an honor, sir.

42:41.015 --> 42:42.141
You are too far away.

42:42.350 --> 42:43.351
I can't hear you.

42:44.310 --> 42:46.855
Why don't you come on over,
we can talk better.

42:51.317 --> 42:52.318
Hmm.

42:52.443 --> 42:53.611
[thread whooshes]

42:53.778 --> 42:55.446
Ha!

43:07.083 --> 43:09.335
[master laughing]

43:09.919 --> 43:11.546
You're both brilliant fighters.

43:11.921 --> 43:13.089
Most impressive.

43:13.965 --> 43:15.008
Thank you, master.

43:16.009 --> 43:18.469
It's been a long time
since we've had guests here.

43:19.053 --> 43:20.221
I am happy you came.

43:20.471 --> 43:21.890
It's been much too quiet.

43:23.183 --> 43:26.519
Sheng, we should take them
to look at the rock.

43:26.644 --> 43:27.687
[Sheng] Of course.

43:55.590 --> 43:58.218
Think of all the warriors
who have fought this duel.

43:58.760 --> 44:00.762
You'll find every name
on these walls.

44:06.601 --> 44:09.521
Why is every duel fought here?
Is there a special reason?

44:10.438 --> 44:12.148
My great-grandsfather fought
here.

44:12.649 --> 44:14.442
He was the first
to fight for China.

44:15.610 --> 44:17.612
He defeated
his Japanese opponent.

44:18.696 --> 44:20.657
This has been the arena since.

44:21.074 --> 44:24.244
You should be grateful.
Few have seen this place.

44:24.327 --> 44:26.579
You are lucky
and you are both so young.

44:27.121 --> 44:29.207
Indeed, you may be
the youngest ever.

44:32.043 --> 44:33.086
It's a shame.

44:33.586 --> 44:36.297
Many fighters,
they dream of dueling here.

44:36.881 --> 44:38.424
But we have to turn them away.

44:40.885 --> 44:41.928
See this stone?

44:42.595 --> 44:45.807
It is an ultimate honor to
have your name engraved here.

44:46.808 --> 44:49.644
And many men
have died for this privilege.

44:49.853 --> 44:52.272
But duels don't always
have to be fatal, do they?

44:52.605 --> 44:54.232
Contests can't be friendly.

44:54.399 --> 44:55.608
[Hashimoto] I disagree.

44:57.193 --> 44:59.153
Warriors must always
fight to the death.

45:01.155 --> 45:05.660
Hashimoto, you fight well,
but there is much you
do not know about us.

45:06.411 --> 45:08.413
For example,
the history of our school.

45:10.123 --> 45:11.499
We cannot fight the duel.

45:12.375 --> 45:13.459
We are forbidden.

45:13.835 --> 45:15.545
For years,
this has been the case.

45:18.006 --> 45:23.011
But I assure you my friend,
if we fought you, the glory
would be ours.

45:27.265 --> 45:29.142
My master has
mentioned your family.

45:29.225 --> 45:30.894
You've done much for our nation.

45:31.019 --> 45:33.605
Your ancestors helped
perfect our art.

45:33.813 --> 45:36.149
Believe me,
your school is famous.

45:36.274 --> 45:38.985
Hmm. I am surprised
he remembered us.

45:41.821 --> 45:43.072
So many have forgotten.

45:45.074 --> 45:46.326
But we'll rise again.

45:53.208 --> 45:57.795
And one day very soon,
Holy Sword House
will fight for China.

48:06.883 --> 48:07.967
Want to know a secret?

48:08.510 --> 48:10.136
I'll tell you.

48:10.595 --> 48:13.181
Nobody wins here, except death.

48:14.390 --> 48:16.768
There will be two more
fighters here, next year.

48:17.143 --> 48:20.438
They will stand here
just like us, in front of
our graves.

48:22.023 --> 48:24.984
[gasp] Look out!

49:26.504 --> 49:27.922
[darts whooshing]

50:12.800 --> 50:16.095
[Sheng] I heard you were
attacked at the graveyard.
I am so sorry.

50:16.304 --> 50:19.516
[Qingyun] It's very strange.
I wonder how they knew
we'd be there.

50:20.183 --> 50:22.018
[Sheng]
My father is investigating it.

50:22.894 --> 50:24.687
[Qingyun]
I'm sure he'll catch them.

50:24.854 --> 50:27.899
[Sheng] We've tightened
the security around
the school grounds.

50:27.982 --> 50:31.110
[Sheng] I'm sure there won't be
any more incidents like that.

50:32.111 --> 50:36.574
[Qingyun] Whoever he was,
well, you ought to
teach him a lesson.

50:36.783 --> 50:39.369
Oh, yes.
He'll live to regret
what he has done.

50:39.869 --> 50:40.870
[Qingyun] I am sure.

50:40.954 --> 50:43.873
[Qingyun] You know
the first time I met you,
you amazed me.

50:43.957 --> 50:47.836
[Qingyun] I couldn't believe
anyone would look so delicate,
yet fight so well.

50:47.919 --> 50:51.172
[Sheng] You saw
through my disguise.
Was it really so obvious?

50:53.591 --> 50:55.593
Of course.
You move with such grace.

50:57.679 --> 50:58.972
I'm glad you noticed me.

51:01.015 --> 51:03.726
How could I have missed you?
You are beautiful.

51:09.524 --> 51:10.984
[Qingyun] Tell me something.

51:11.067 --> 51:14.279
[Qingyun] Why would
a woman like you want to
dress up like a man?

51:15.154 --> 51:17.240
[Sheng]
Not many men will fight a woman.

51:17.615 --> 51:19.617
[Qingyun] You shouldn't
hide your beauty.

51:19.909 --> 51:21.202
[Qingyun] Be proud of it.

52:21.429 --> 52:22.472
Father.

52:22.555 --> 52:23.932
[dad] Where have you been?

52:24.057 --> 52:25.558
Well, I just went for a walk.

52:26.601 --> 52:30.980
You know, for centuries,
Holy Sword House was
the number one school in China.

52:31.397 --> 52:33.858
We were known and respected
all over the country.

52:35.568 --> 52:39.405
And then came Shaolin,
now we are nothing.

52:40.406 --> 52:41.866
They look down on us.

52:43.910 --> 52:48.790
When we first fought the
Japanese, it was my ancestors
who defeated them.

52:49.457 --> 52:50.917
We were Chinese heroes.

52:53.461 --> 52:54.462
But now...

52:56.005 --> 52:59.425
Father, I'll do my best
to win their respect.

53:00.885 --> 53:01.970
You?

53:02.011 --> 53:03.096
I doubt it.

53:06.808 --> 53:08.142
Just look at yourself.

53:08.226 --> 53:09.686
Your mind's not your own.

53:11.229 --> 53:13.481
Lichi Wang has you
under his thumb.

53:17.527 --> 53:18.528
I'm sorry.

53:20.071 --> 53:21.155
Please forgive me.

53:23.741 --> 53:25.952
Sheng, I don't blame you.

53:26.995 --> 53:28.037
It's my fault.

53:28.621 --> 53:30.290
I pinned all of my hopes on you.

53:30.331 --> 53:31.791
But I asked too much of you.

53:32.876 --> 53:35.461
I will find a way
to restore our family's honor.

54:04.449 --> 54:08.203
[fighting]

54:37.315 --> 54:38.733
[whistles]

54:48.826 --> 54:52.622
Gentlemen, I apologize
for today's incident.

54:53.665 --> 54:56.793
We were all so relieved
that neither of you
were badly injured.

54:58.711 --> 54:59.879
Let's drink a toast.

55:00.839 --> 55:03.091
Cheers! To your health!

55:09.722 --> 55:13.434
Please, sir.
Don't apologize.
It's not your fault.

55:15.770 --> 55:18.481
Hashimoto. Kenji.

55:18.731 --> 55:19.899
You are honored guests.

55:20.775 --> 55:21.985
Welcome to my home.

55:22.485 --> 55:23.987
I hope you'll be happy here.

55:24.153 --> 55:25.154
Thank you, sir.

55:40.879 --> 55:42.630
China has much to be proud of.

55:43.882 --> 55:45.550
Delicious food and wine.

55:46.342 --> 55:47.844
We don't get this at home.

55:48.428 --> 55:52.849
Huh. So, it's no wonder
you are always fighting with us,
you envy us.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.100
- Sheng!
- Hmm!

55:54.392 --> 55:57.228
They do say there is black sheep
in every family.

55:57.604 --> 55:59.272
We have them in my country too.

55:59.731 --> 56:02.275
They say whatever they want,
regardless of others.

56:05.987 --> 56:08.114
Hashimoto,
you are a man of dignity.

56:08.489 --> 56:09.574
I respect you.

56:09.657 --> 56:10.658
To your health.

56:10.992 --> 56:12.493
[Master Han laughs]

56:12.619 --> 56:14.204
Let's drink to our friendship.

56:14.495 --> 56:16.331
Come, I toast to you.

56:25.048 --> 56:28.426
Master Han, why haven't none of
the other guests arrived yet?

56:29.511 --> 56:31.054
Oh, calm down, don't worry.

56:31.804 --> 56:33.473
They'll all arrive in good time.

56:34.349 --> 56:36.142
No one will want to
miss this fight.

56:36.559 --> 56:39.229
Sheng, our guests
are expert fighters.

56:39.229 --> 56:42.607
If you have time,
you should watch them
practice if they agree.

56:44.359 --> 56:45.443
Of course.

56:46.861 --> 56:48.947
Uh, but sir,
your school is great.

56:49.239 --> 56:50.823
We should be learning from you.

56:51.324 --> 56:52.325
Thank you.

56:52.367 --> 56:53.409
I'm flattered.

56:53.660 --> 56:54.827
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

56:57.205 --> 56:58.289
We'll drink.

57:05.296 --> 57:06.506
What a pity.

57:06.756 --> 57:07.799
This is good wine.

57:08.299 --> 57:09.551
It's a shame it's wasted.

57:09.676 --> 57:10.677
[Sheng yells]

57:11.386 --> 57:12.428
Wouldn't you agree?

58:01.895 --> 58:03.521
Puff!

58:10.570 --> 58:11.696
Well, that was quick.

58:18.953 --> 58:20.205
I am disgusted with you.

58:20.705 --> 58:22.207
You are a priest, aren't you?

58:22.498 --> 58:23.541
You fool!

58:24.125 --> 58:26.127
You are forgetting
your loyalty to Japan.

58:27.629 --> 58:29.380
You are an insult
to our school.

58:29.714 --> 58:31.674
The Shogun himself
sent me over here.

58:32.258 --> 58:35.011
The Shogun? Yes.

58:38.223 --> 58:40.099
Maybe you should
take a look at this.

58:43.228 --> 58:47.565
Kenji, you are in full
command of the mission
to the Holy Sword House.

58:47.815 --> 58:51.319
Ensure that the duel is handled
to our complete satisfaction.

58:52.195 --> 58:54.697
Kill anyone
who stands in your way.

58:57.909 --> 58:59.452
I am a Samurai warrior.

58:59.869 --> 59:01.663
I want a fair fight.

59:03.164 --> 59:04.624
We serve the same cause.

59:07.752 --> 59:11.589
Seek honor for Japan.
And serve the Shogun.

59:16.511 --> 59:18.888
Then why did the Shogun
send me to the duel?

59:23.393 --> 59:25.353
You are just
part of a larger plan.

59:28.106 --> 59:29.607
The fight is just a diversion.

59:30.316 --> 59:32.569
We are going to kidnap
China's best fighters.

59:34.696 --> 59:36.614
A deal has been
made with Master Han.

59:36.739 --> 59:40.410
He kills Qingyun,
and his daughter Sheng
will fight you.

59:40.994 --> 59:42.078
And you lose.

59:42.912 --> 59:47.750
When we understand
their Kung Fu, then we'll
have full control of China.

59:52.922 --> 59:54.007
But why use me?

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.726
Remember, you owe
the success of your
school to the Shogun.

01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:33.314
How do all those names
make you feel?

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:39.320
Those men were heroes.

01:01:40.154 --> 01:01:41.281
They knew they'd die.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:55.545
As father says, all for glory.

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:01.801
They are like me,
they wanted to win.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.847
Is that really
worth dying for?

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.766
Most people think so.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.353
I hope you are
not one of them.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:20.612
No, but this fight is important
to me, I have to test myself.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.241
If I ask you to,
will you give up the fight?

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:36.503
I don't want to
see you get killed.

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:41.382
So you think I'll lose.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.428
- No, but can't you...
- I can't.

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:32.559
This is it.
Tomorrow we fight the duel.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.771
No matter what happens
I will not yield to you.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:41.484
And I promise you,
I'll take your sword from you.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:49.367
[Hashimoto] Or I'll die here.

01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:54.998
That's a warrior's life.

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.250
We either kill, or get killed.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:03.590
If you are not good,
you'll die on the battle field.

01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:07.427
But if you are good,
you'll spend your life fighting.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.388
Either way, we die in the end.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.015
It's not an easy life.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:13.808
You complain?

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:15.768
I chose this life
and have no regrets.

01:04:16.978 --> 01:04:18.396
- And you?
- Not at all.

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:24.819
Tell me something,
do you think there is
something strange going on here?

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:27.864
I've got a bad feeling.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:29.449
Something's gone wrong.

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:31.284
I feel this won't
be a fair fight.

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:36.331
But I trust you.

01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:42.629
I'll make sure
it's a fair fight.

01:04:57.685 --> 01:04:58.728
Hmm?

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.228
[master moaning in pain]

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:48.319
- Master.
- Leave me.
Go and save Sheng.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:55.743
Ah!

01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:09.424
[everyone moaning in pain]

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:10.466
Master?

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:16.431
Master!

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:24.314
[door opens]

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:32.238
[cane hits the floor]

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:37.035
Qingyun. [laughs]

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:44.542
You are the Lord of The Sword?
Master of the morons more alike.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:48.171
You actually fell for it.

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:50.548
[master] Ha ha.
I was born with no legs.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.302
But I will be laughing
even louder when my
daughter beats Hashimoto...

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:56.804
and restores the glory
of the Holy Sword House.

01:06:57.639 --> 01:07:00.975
And she will win.
I shall show you, boy.

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:02.560
I'll show them all.

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:09.234
[master laughing]

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:33.842
[door knocking]

01:07:33.925 --> 01:07:35.218
[door opens]

01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:38.680
Where's Qingyun?

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.813
Your dirty tricks have made
your wish come true.

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:51.359
You'll get your fight,
and I'll kill you.

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:58.783
Believe me, my sword loves
impaling traitors like you.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:00.493
I am no traitor.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:04.914
Hmm!

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:09.711
Well, we have our hostages.
The plan has worked so far.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:11.963
But they are going to
miss those monks.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:14.549
It's a problem.
People might suspect us.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.844
Relax, the Shogun has sent word.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:21.555
We take them to Japan.
We move them tonight.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:24.600
And Hashimoto,
he'll want this duel.

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:25.894
Leave him to me.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.022
They are the Shogun's orders.

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:30.564
He won't disobey them.

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:33.109
You've done well.

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.236
Your dream will soon come true.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.696
[chuckles]
[door opens]

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:38.990
No.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.326
I won't let you do this.

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:46.831
Sheng.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:51.920
How could you do this?

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:54.546
It's not what you think.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:58.468
I'd do anything for you,
except betray China.

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:02.305
Don't you realize
that this will destroy
our reputation forever?

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:05.517
The country will despise us.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:10.104
Father, listen to me...

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:14.399
Shut up!
I know what I am doing.
You can't stop me.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:17.612
Then you are on your own.
I'll never help.

01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:18.988
Stop!

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.698
Don't you forget
your place, girl!

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:24.160
You'll do exactly as I say.

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:28.997
I'll never betray my country.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:41.301
[stone door opens]

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:58.862
- I'll get the antidote.
- Yeah.

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:18.965
[sword whooshing]

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:29.392
Please don't do this.

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:34.731
Dad.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:38.735
I brought you up,
taught you Kung Fu,
and you treat me like this?

01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:53.208
Dad, put the sword down.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.211
Think about
what you are doing, please.

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:07.096
Master Han.
They are just using you,
don't trust the Japanese.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.183
The Shogun is looking for
a way to humiliate us.

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:12.435
You are nothing to it,
just a puppet.

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:16.523
Think about it, Master Han.

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:24.322
I love you very dearly, father.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:27.158
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

01:11:27.659 --> 01:11:31.371
If our people find out
what you are doing,
they'll never spare you.

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:33.957
Our people?

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:37.836
I have no feelings
for those ingrates.

01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:43.049
Listen, our ancestors fought
and died for them.

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:47.762
Your people, they never
once thanked us.

01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:52.559
They refused to let us fight
the duel, even though
we are the greatest.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:12:00.608
I want you to show them, Sheng.
You are as good a fighter
as any from Shaolin Temple.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:07.198
Qingyun, my father
will never back down.

01:12:07.699 --> 01:12:10.118
He wants me to restore
the glory of our school.

01:12:11.119 --> 01:12:14.247
So now we must fight.
It's our only way.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.125
Master Han, please reconsider.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:19.752
You could disgrace
our entire nation.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:21.754
Hmm!

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:23.673
I'll kill you!

01:12:56.915 --> 01:13:01.336
Ah!
[roof shatters]

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:02.629
Dad!

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:06.925
[gasp]

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:12.639
[Sheng screams]

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.015
Sheng!

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:16.809
No, don't.
Please don't kill him.

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:18.728
He doesn't know
what he is doing.

01:13:24.526 --> 01:13:27.904
Sheng!
Sheng!

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:34.661
Sheng! Sheng!
Please wake up.
We can start over again.

01:13:36.371 --> 01:13:39.332
I promised her
that she would become a hero.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:41.960
Come on!

01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:43.711
Sheng.

01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:45.463
Please don't die.

01:13:47.674 --> 01:13:49.467
I'll teach you more Kung Fu.

01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:51.511
We'll start again.

01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:56.182
Sheng! Sheng!

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:23.960
Hold it!

01:14:33.303 --> 01:14:34.888
I won't let you do this.

01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:38.850
I am acting
on the Shogun's orders.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:41.477
Orders?
And what are they?

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:46.941
I will follow my master's code.

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:50.153
I must complete my mission.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:53.281
I order you to kill yourself.

01:14:53.907 --> 01:14:54.908
Do it now!

01:14:56.618 --> 01:14:57.619
I will die.

01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:01.289
But first, I fight the Chinese.

01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:05.585
Hmm!

01:16:07.856 --> 01:16:09.065
[sword whooshes]

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:35.633

01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:41.347
[darts whooshing]

01:16:41.431 --> 01:16:47.353
[darts whooshing]

01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:17.342
[explodes]

01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:45.578
[explodes]

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:01.094
Like my words, you will die.

01:18:02.971 --> 01:18:04.514
[explodes]

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.522
We still have some
unfinished business.

01:19:00.195 --> 01:19:02.697
I won't fight you
It would mean nothing.

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.203
You promised.
You must fight with me.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.163
The duel is over.

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:11.414
We are going home.

01:19:14.918 --> 01:19:15.919
No, you are not.

01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:24.969
Is winning so important to you?

01:19:26.888 --> 01:19:29.974
Well, what would you do
if something close to you
was murdered?

01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:31.100
You'd fight.

01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:33.603
Too many have died.
It stops here.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.023
[master screams]

01:19:39.943 --> 01:19:43.154
Master! Master! Master!

01:20:35.081 --> 01:20:41.880
[sword clinks]

01:20:46.217 --> 01:20:48.219
[Hashimoto screaming]

01:20:50.138 --> 01:20:54.309
[fighting]

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:14.579
[swords clash]

01:21:14.621 --> 01:21:16.539
[swords ringing]

01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:18.958
[birds chirping]

01:21:19.209 --> 01:21:21.044
[waves roaring]

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:40.104
Ah!

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:45.443
[fighting]

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:26.067
[ground shaking]

01:22:26.109 --> 01:22:29.696
[both smearing]

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:18.828
This will make us even.

01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:27.504
Let's stop this now, can we?

01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:54.614
[both screaming]

01:24:24.519 --> 01:24:27.939
