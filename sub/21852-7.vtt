Yes, Eric?

00:56.849 --> 00:58.517
Eric,
this isn't working.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.936
Heidi, no, please!

01:01.103 --> 01:03.564
Heidi, Heidi,
I would be nothing without you.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.066
Okay?
I'm sorry.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.567
Okay?
Please!

01:06.734 --> 01:07.985
You called me a whore

01:08.152 --> 01:09.862
and pushed me
in front of a car.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.697
Heidi,
I was in a bad mood.

01:11.864 --> 01:14.116
I told you -- that's
what happens after I eat.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.701
My blood sugar spikes,

01:15.868 --> 01:17.203
and I get all anxious
and then I crash --

01:17.369 --> 01:19.121
Eric, you can't just
keep being mean to me

01:19.288 --> 01:20.915
and blaming it
on your blood sugar.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.291
But it--
But it's true, Heidi!

01:22.458 --> 01:23.417
It's all my mom's fault.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.919
She feeds me
all this crap,

01:25.086 --> 01:26.087
and my body doesn't know
how to process it.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.046
Mom!

01:27.213 --> 01:28.297
Mom!

01:28.464 --> 01:30.007
Yes, hon?

01:30.174 --> 01:32.760
You fucked up my life, Mom!
Fuck you!

01:32.927 --> 01:34.428
How could you feed me
like that, you bitch?!

01:34.595 --> 01:36.013
Get outta here!

01:36.180 --> 01:37.932
Eric, if blood sugar
is really the problem,

01:38.099 --> 01:41.060
then you need to change
how you eat, right?

01:41.227 --> 01:43.604
Right. Like, what'd ya --
what'd ya mean?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.231
Eric, every time
I've talked to you

01:45.397 --> 01:47.024
about maybe being a vegan
with me,

01:47.191 --> 01:48.734
you just tell me
vegans are pussies,

01:48.901 --> 01:50.986
but then you try and blame
food and your mom for --

01:51.153 --> 01:53.072
It is the food
and it is my mom, Heidi!

01:53.239 --> 01:54.657
It <i>is!</i>
I wanna be vegan with you!

01:54.824 --> 01:56.951
I need your help to show me how.
Please, Heidi.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.369
I need you right now,
more than ever.

01:58.536 --> 01:59.578
I want to do this.
Please.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.247
You really mean it?

02:01.413 --> 02:03.165
Yes, Heidi!
That's how much I love you.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.625
I'm vegan from now on.

02:04.792 --> 02:05.960
All right, Eric.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.337
We'll see how
this goes, okay?

02:08.504 --> 02:09.463
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.465
Okay.
Okay, bye, honey.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.474
That dirty whore!

02:20.641 --> 02:22.059
Who does that bitch
think she is?!

02:22.226 --> 02:24.645
Packing my lunch for me?
Fuck her, dude!

02:24.812 --> 02:26.480
Pissed off at your girlfriend
again, huh, Eric?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.023
She's not
a girlfriend.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.192
She's a controlling,
manipulative whore!

02:30.359 --> 02:31.861
That's enough,
Cartman.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.571
I am so sick
of hearing you

02:33.737 --> 02:34.947
call Heidi
horrible things!

02:35.114 --> 02:36.615
That's because
you don't understand

02:36.782 --> 02:38.284
how much it sucks
to be in a relationship.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.577
Hey, babe.

02:39.743 --> 02:40.828
Oh, hey, babe.
What's going on?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.663
What are you up to?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.624
Nothing, just telling the guys
how awesome it is to be vegan.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.793
That's great.
You wanna come eat with me?

02:47.960 --> 02:49.211
I can explain
what I packed.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.590
Yeah, sure.
That sounds awesome.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.258
I don't get it.

02:54.425 --> 02:56.093
I just really
don't get it.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.761
How is she still
supporting him?

02:57.928 --> 02:59.221
She loves him,
I guess.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.598
But he clearly
sucks.

03:00.764 --> 03:01.891
She has to know
he sucks.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.058
What the hell
is going on?

03:03.225 --> 03:04.810
Well, it's not
our problem.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.270
It <i>is</i> our problem.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.814
This is affecting us --
our whole school.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.984
There's got to be a reason
she sticks by him.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.409
Oh, Heidi.

03:20.576 --> 03:21.702
Heidi,
you got a sec?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.662
- Oh, hey, Kyle.
- Hey.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.331
Uh, listen, uh --

03:25.497 --> 03:27.416
I-I know you and Cartman
have an anniversary coming up,

03:27.583 --> 03:29.084
and I was just wondering,
you know,

03:29.251 --> 03:30.336
how do you think
he's doing?

03:30.502 --> 03:31.462
As a boyfriend?

03:31.629 --> 03:33.172
Well,
what do you mean?

03:33.339 --> 03:35.633
Well, you know, like,
some of us are thinking that,

03:35.799 --> 03:38.469
uh, maybe he's not super
qualified to be with you.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.179
Oh, God.
Not you, too.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.640
Just, like, what are
the things about Cartman

03:42.806 --> 03:45.351
that you find...
remotely redeeming?

03:45.517 --> 03:47.686
Look, don't you think I get it
enough from my girlfriends?

03:47.853 --> 03:49.897
"He sucks, Heidi.
What's wrong with you?

03:50.064 --> 03:51.482
Why can't you admit
he's a loser?

03:51.649 --> 03:53.442
How could anyone
ever go with him?"

03:53.609 --> 03:55.319
I was just
following my heart.

03:55.486 --> 03:56.779
Isn't that what
you're supposed to do?

03:56.946 --> 03:58.113
You don't have
to get defensive.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.365
- I just --
- Who's being defensive?!

03:59.531 --> 04:00.908
He's great!
We're doing great!

04:01.075 --> 04:02.910
I didn't make
a bad decision.

04:03.077 --> 04:06.121
I don't need you to stand there
and say, "I told you so."

04:06.288 --> 04:07.289
I didn't say,
"I told you" --

04:07.456 --> 04:09.083
You know, you don't know
what Eric's like

04:09.250 --> 04:11.043
when we're alone,
okay?

04:11.210 --> 04:14.046
He's actually
really good to me.

04:15.506 --> 04:16.757
Wow.

04:22.554 --> 04:23.973
Heidi!

04:24.139 --> 04:25.599
Oh, my God.
You're not gonna believe this.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.351
- What?
- You were so right...

04:27.518 --> 04:28.394
...when you said there were

04:28.560 --> 04:29.895
vegan options
for everything.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.022
Remember how you told me
about Beyond Meat?

04:32.189 --> 04:33.315
Yeah, the vegan meat
that's made

04:33.482 --> 04:35.025
with all vegetables
and plants.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.277
Well, I tried it,
and you were right.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.611
You can't even
tell the difference

04:37.778 --> 04:38.946
between that
and real meat.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.281
Really?
That's great, babe.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.408
So now I've been trying
all kinds of vegan foods.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.952
You gotta try this.
It's called Beyond KFC.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.371
Oh, wow.
It's all plant-based.

04:47.538 --> 04:48.664
Soy protein, and just --
Y-You gotta taste this.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.124
Just try it.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.003
It tastes just like KFC.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.839
I know, right?!
Isn't that crazy?

04:57.006 --> 04:58.257
Like -- Like, seriously,

04:58.424 --> 04:59.758
how could you even tell
that this was vegan?

04:59.925 --> 05:02.136
Try the -- try the Beyond
Mashed Potatoes and Gravy too.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.679
They say you can even drink
the Beyond Gravy by itself

05:03.846 --> 05:04.930
as like a protein boost.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.267
I don't know about you,
but I could eat this every day.

05:10.019 --> 05:12.604
Yeah, it's really good.

05:12.771 --> 05:13.897
Delicious.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.069
Guys, listen.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.071
I think I know why
Heidi won't admit

05:21.238 --> 05:22.239
Cartman's
a horrible boyfriend.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.949
Dude, are you
still on this?

05:24.116 --> 05:25.743
Yeah!
It's important!

05:25.909 --> 05:27.411
Maybe she's telling
the truth, Kyle.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.413
Maybe Eric really does
love and support her

05:29.580 --> 05:30.706
in ways
that we don't see.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.249
You guys!
You guys!

05:32.416 --> 05:34.209
- Have you seen Heidi?
- No.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.462
Well, uh, we've been trying
some different foods lately,

05:36.628 --> 05:39.381
and, uh, Heidi's put on
some pounds, you guys.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.175
Heidi's
getting fat?

05:41.342 --> 05:42.676
Yeah, Token,
don't start ripping on me

05:42.843 --> 05:44.219
for having a fat girlfriend,
all right?

05:44.386 --> 05:45.637
Just try
and be cool about it.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.222
Hey, babe.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.683
Oh, hey, hey, hey, Heidi.
What's going on?

05:51.643 --> 05:53.687
I-I'm not feeling
the best again.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.231
I might see if my mom
can come pick me up.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.233
Pick <i>you</i> up?
That could be tough.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.403
I -- I know,
but I just feel bloated.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.197
I think there might
have been something bad

06:03.364 --> 06:04.907
in that Beyond Arby's.

06:05.074 --> 06:05.991
Yeah,
well, cool babe.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.576
Maybe you should, uh,

06:07.743 --> 06:09.286
just waddle on down
to the nurse's office.

06:09.453 --> 06:10.704
Can you come with?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.206
Oh, sure.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.209
We have to help
that girl.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.086
Can't you see
what's happening?

06:17.252 --> 06:19.296
Kyle,
it's none of our business.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.672
You're wrong.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.966
In a way...

06:23.133 --> 06:26.428
I think we're <i>all</i> going out
with Cartman right now.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.138
Uh-huh.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.807
Yeah, I understand that,
faggot.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.267
And you should understand
how my balls are gonna taste

06:32.434 --> 06:34.228
when your country
starts needing money.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.854
I don't give two shits
about a treaty.

06:36.021 --> 06:36.897
You're a Polish midget.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.148
Come in.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.944
Uh-huh. Hang -- Hang on.
I'm gonna call you back.

06:42.111 --> 06:43.695
Yeah, go fuck yourself,
retard.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.116
Mr. President,
we have a problem.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.659
People are
pretty upset.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.869
Oh, don't tell me
people are still mad

06:51.036 --> 06:52.454
about that nigger thing.

06:52.621 --> 06:56.041
It's pronounced "Niger,"
Mr. President.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.835
And it's a country
in Africa.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.711
Ooh, aren't we fancy.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.214
Okay, I don't want
a bunch "Nigers" in Africa

07:02.381 --> 07:03.507
aiding terrorists.

07:03.674 --> 07:04.925
Mr. President,

07:05.092 --> 07:06.343
you need to be
a little more careful.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.095
There's
an investigation.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.763
A worker
with ties to Russia

07:09.930 --> 07:12.474
was found
raped and executed.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.685
Raped and executed?

07:14.852 --> 07:15.853
Oh, you mean
fucked to death?

07:16.019 --> 07:17.438
Oh, yeah, that was me.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.857
Mr. President, people
are starting to question

07:20.023 --> 07:21.108
your oath
to the office!

07:21.275 --> 07:22.901
My oath to the office

07:23.068 --> 07:25.320
was that I would fuck
everyone to death, remember?

07:25.487 --> 07:26.905
Ooh, I 'member!

07:27.072 --> 07:28.490
- Me, too. I 'member!
- I 'member that.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.159
You guys be quiet.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.577
And you guys
just get out there

07:31.743 --> 07:33.662
and put a positive spin
on this whole thing.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.498
How are we supposed to put
a positive spin on it?

07:36.665 --> 07:38.375
It's getting pretty hard
to keep defending you.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.669
Maybe it's time
we put our foot down.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.296
Oooh.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.968
Hope you brought
some condoms.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.820
Hello.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.780
I know things have been
difficult between us lately.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.783
I know you think
all boys are sort of pigs,

08:11.950 --> 08:13.660
but just know that
a lot of us boys

08:13.827 --> 08:17.414
think girls are amazing
and smart and beautiful.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.333
Not -- Not like
hot beautiful,

08:19.500 --> 08:20.834
I mean like
inside beautiful.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.127
I -- I'm not saying
you're hot.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.337
You're not --
You're not hot.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.796
I'm not saying
you're ugly.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.007
It doesn't matter.
You're all hot on the inside.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.176
If we could all just see
inside you, it would be hot.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.219
Oh, shit.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.762
What do you want,
Kyle?

08:31.929 --> 08:33.263
It's Heidi Turner.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.139
You guys shouldn't
criticize her so much

08:34.306 --> 08:35.766
for going with Cartman.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.392
Why not? Eric Cartman
is a horrible person.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.394
I know!
I-I know that, okay?

08:39.561 --> 08:41.146
Trust me, I hate Cartman
as much as any of you.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.357
But just, give her some space,
you know?

08:43.524 --> 08:45.359
You can't keep saying,
"We told you so,"

08:45.526 --> 08:46.944
because if you make her
feel dumb,

08:47.110 --> 08:48.111
she just doubles down
and tries to prove to herself

08:48.278 --> 08:49.321
that it wasn't dumb.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.449
Why do <i>you</i> care?
Do you like Heidi?

08:52.616 --> 08:53.867
No!

08:54.034 --> 08:55.786
Oh, my God.
He <i>so</i> likes Heidi.

08:55.953 --> 08:56.578
Obvi.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.330
No, I don't!

08:58.497 --> 09:00.290
Do I?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.461
Hey, Kyle!

09:04.628 --> 09:05.837
Hey, I was thinkin' about
what you said --

09:06.004 --> 09:07.464
how we should all help Heidi
break up with Eric?

09:07.631 --> 09:10.092
You're right.
It's our moral obligation.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.844
Yeah, no, we're not
getting involved in that.

09:13.011 --> 09:13.971
Oh, we're not?

09:14.137 --> 09:15.514
Yeah, no,
yeah, I, uh --

09:15.681 --> 09:17.558
I think we need
to stay out of it.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.142
Oh.
Okay, then.

09:22.062 --> 09:22.980
Cartman, can we talk?

09:23.146 --> 09:24.439
Sure, Kyle.
What's up?

09:24.606 --> 09:26.650
I just -- I hope that
maybe you can realize

09:26.817 --> 09:28.193
what you have with Heidi

09:28.360 --> 09:30.821
and -- and just try
to be good to her, okay?

09:30.988 --> 09:32.990
Kyle, let me tell you something
about relationships.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.408
There's always two sides.
Okay?

09:34.575 --> 09:36.410
You compromise,
she compromises.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.036
Sometimes you criticize
each other,

09:38.203 --> 09:39.997
but it's all part of trying
to make each other better.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.415
Some day, maybe you'll
have a girlfriend

09:41.582 --> 09:42.457
and you'll understand.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.417
Oh, here she comes.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.588
Boom-baba, boom-baba!

09:47.754 --> 09:49.006
Clear the hallway,
everyone!

09:49.172 --> 09:50.007
Heidi's comin' troo!

09:51.383 --> 09:53.218
Wha-- What are you
doing, Eric?

09:53.385 --> 09:54.970
I was just practicing marching
bass drum for my buddy Kyle.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.263
It's his favorite.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.514
Oh, okay.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.308
Um, are we still on
for lunch?

09:59.474 --> 10:01.018
You betcha.
Can't wait.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.811
Okay.
See ya.

10:02.978 --> 10:06.231
Boom-baba, boom-baba, boom!

10:11.069 --> 10:12.571
Some concern

10:12.738 --> 10:14.781
over the president's competency
again today.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.992
It was during
a Middle East peace conference

10:17.159 --> 10:19.578
when the president referred to
the people of Saudi Arabia

10:19.745 --> 10:22.247
as "a bunch
of dirty sand Nigers."

10:22.414 --> 10:23.832
Though the comments
seem divisive,

10:23.999 --> 10:25.459
Speaker of the House
Paul Ryan

10:25.626 --> 10:28.337
says he's sticking
by his president 100%.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.798
Speaker Ryan,
it's the anniversary

10:31.965 --> 10:33.050
of the president
being elected.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.052
How do you think
he's doing?

10:35.218 --> 10:36.428
Well,
what do you mean?

10:36.595 --> 10:38.180
He's great.
We're doing great.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.140
A lot of people judge him
and just see the negative.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.142
People don't know how great
the president can be

10:42.309 --> 10:43.810
behind closed doors.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.480
They don't get to see
all his good qualities.

10:46.647 --> 10:50.275
Uh-huh. And is that semen
on your black eye?

10:50.442 --> 10:52.194
Oh! No, I-I, uh --
I tripped on a doorknob!

10:52.361 --> 10:53.987
That's just --
That's doorknob cum.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.084
You doing okay,
Heidi?

11:07.250 --> 11:10.170
I keep thinking
Eric's going to change.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.050
Heidi...

11:15.217 --> 11:16.510
People like Cartman,

11:16.677 --> 11:19.012
they always make things
someone else's fault.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.723
We all wrongly see ourselves
as the victim sometimes,

11:21.890 --> 11:24.518
but Cartman sees himself
as the victim all the time.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.853
He'll always find someone
to blame for his shortcomings,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.731
and because of that,
he's never gonna change.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.817
Before we started
going out,

11:31.983 --> 11:34.111
I was
in a really bad place.

11:34.277 --> 11:37.364
I felt pushed away
by society.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.241
Then this guy came along

11:39.408 --> 11:40.909
who told me all the things
I wanted to hear,

11:41.076 --> 11:43.745
and I just went
with it.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.622
Does that make me
a bad person?

11:45.789 --> 11:46.998
No, Heidi.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.835
Good people make bad decisions
every day.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.629
I've been defending him
for so long.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.297
I don't know how
I'm gonna face people

11:54.464 --> 11:55.882

Hi...Hi...Hi...

13:04.743 --> 13:07.954
Hi...Hi...Hi...

13:08.121 --> 13:09.331
What do you want?

13:09.498 --> 13:13.210
He-He-He-Heidi broke up with me,
Token.

13:15.504 --> 13:16.713
So?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.882
I have nothing now, Token.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.343
She was my whole world.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.929
C-Can I just stay here
with you please?

13:24.095 --> 13:25.972
What?! Why?!
You still have a house!

13:26.139 --> 13:28.558
I know how you feel now,
Token.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.393
To be pissed off
at the world.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.729
To feel completely screwed over
by society.

13:32.896 --> 13:33.980
I totally get it now.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.941
I wanna do what you guys do

13:36.107 --> 13:38.443
and go disrespect the flag
and flip cars over and stuff.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.661
Token, pleeeeease.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.454
I'm sorry for everything!

13:49.621 --> 13:52.123
I really understand now
how you guys feel.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.417
Please, what time
is your family gonna go

13:54.584 --> 13:56.044
disrespect the flag tonight?

13:56.211 --> 13:57.838
- I wanna go with.
- Get outta here!

13:58.004 --> 13:59.840
- What's going on?
- Nothing, Mom.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.093
Heidi broke up
with meeeee...

14:03.260 --> 14:05.846
Token, he's freezing.
Come on in out of the snow.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.390
Thank youuuuu...

14:08.557 --> 14:09.599
No!

14:13.812 --> 14:14.646
Okay, we're safe to talk.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.189
It's not safe!

14:16.356 --> 14:18.066
<i>No where's</i> safe,
don't you understand?

14:18.233 --> 14:19.818
We're all about to
get killed!

14:19.985 --> 14:22.612
Shh! Keep your voices down!
Look at this?

14:22.779 --> 14:25.073
What are
all these numbers?

14:25.240 --> 14:26.992
The latest approval ratings.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.160
I've been researching
our own independent poll.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.663
The president is <i>tanking.</i>

14:31.830 --> 14:35.417
These numbers are so low
that we might just have an out.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.878
Well, don't you guys
see what this means?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.005
I don't know anything,
I'm just a turtle.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.924
It means that the swing voters
are turning against him.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.676
It's those people who matter.

14:44.843 --> 14:47.220
Those are the ones who can
finally turn this thing around!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.222
And then we don't have to
get killed!

14:49.389 --> 14:51.308
We can't let the president
know about this.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.435
- Just let him--
- What are you guys talking about?

14:53.602 --> 14:54.895
No, nothing!

14:55.061 --> 14:56.021
- Nope!
- Nothing, Mr. President.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.439
Oh, okay...

14:57.606 --> 14:59.232
Just having a little chat
or something?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.109
It's an opinion poll,
Mr. President.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.819
Your numbers are down,

15:02.986 --> 15:04.821
and I wanted to show you
so you could do something!

15:04.988 --> 15:06.615
Oh, you bitch!

15:06.781 --> 15:08.700
I was the one who researched
the poll, Mr. President!

15:08.867 --> 15:10.201
Let me see that...

15:10.368 --> 15:13.622
Huh...
Isn't that interesting.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.332
But it's not a problem.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.043
See, I know something
about societal psychology

15:18.209 --> 15:20.045
that you three turd balls
don't.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.713
Everything's gonna be fine.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.846
So...

15:30.013 --> 15:31.056
You guys about done
with the soup?

15:31.222 --> 15:32.849
Don't you like it,
Eric?

15:33.016 --> 15:34.267
Well, yeah, no,
it's great.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.685
It's just -- well,
what time do you guys

15:35.852 --> 15:37.354
usually go out and disrespect
the flag and stuff?

15:37.520 --> 15:39.397
- What?
- Oh, no...

15:39.564 --> 15:41.316
Don't tell me you guys
already disrespected the flag

15:41.483 --> 15:42.859
and flipped over cars today?
Did I miss it?

15:43.026 --> 15:44.486
What the hell
are you talking about?

15:44.653 --> 15:46.363
I told you
not to let him in.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.740
Please, I don't know what to do
with all this anger and hurt!

15:48.907 --> 15:51.117
I'm sorry your girlfriend
broke up with you, Eric,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.161
but maybe
you'll get back together.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.373
No, no, we've broken up before,
but this time is different.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.541
I can tell.
Something's changed with her.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.251
Heidi won't even
answer my phone calls.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.253
Heidi?
Turner?

16:02.420 --> 16:04.756
- The Turners' daughter?
- Yeah...

16:04.923 --> 16:06.800
I thought she was
with that Kyle Broflovski kid.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.763
- What?
- I saw them at the park today holding hands.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.975
Kyle.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.143
Kyle?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.396
Kyle!

16:19.562 --> 16:21.481
Kyle, Kyle!

16:21.648 --> 16:24.359
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!

16:24.526 --> 16:26.069
Kyle!

16:29.614 --> 16:31.408
Kyle...

16:33.702 --> 16:35.495
Kyle!

16:48.883 --> 16:50.552
Kyle...

16:50.719 --> 16:52.178
Yeah. Kyle.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.148
Kyle!

17:06.651 --> 17:08.111
I should have known.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.863
You lying <i>snake!</i>

17:10.030 --> 17:11.406
Cartman, I didn't mean
for things to happen

17:11.573 --> 17:12.824
the way they did.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.492
Did it bother you
that I was happy?

17:14.659 --> 17:16.661
Is that why you took her
from me, Kyle?!

17:16.828 --> 17:18.246
Cartman, you weren't happy.
Shut up, Kyle.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.914
All you did was bitch about her
all the time!

17:20.081 --> 17:21.082
You're not gonna talk your way
out of this one!

17:21.249 --> 17:23.001
This is the end, Kyle.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.753
It's you or me!

17:24.919 --> 17:26.838
- Come on, Cartman, I-
- You took everything from me!

17:27.005 --> 17:28.256
Stop it.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.300
All you've ever done
is work to ruin my life!

17:30.467 --> 17:32.510
Well, now I'm gonna
finally fight back!

17:32.677 --> 17:34.054
Fuck him up, Eric!

17:34.220 --> 17:35.096
Aah!

17:35.263 --> 17:37.682
Fuck you, Kyle.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.350
I'm sorry, Cartman.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.437
You just have to accept
that Heidi's moved on.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.195
Guys, I just wanna say
here's to Heidi!

17:50.361 --> 17:52.363
Welcome back
to the land of the living!

17:52.530 --> 17:54.115
To Heidi!

17:54.282 --> 17:56.618
Thanks, guys!
Thanks for taking me out.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.161
- This is really fun!
- No worries!

17:58.328 --> 18:00.246
We're just glad you
finally came to your senses!

18:00.413 --> 18:01.956
Yeah! No kidding!

18:02.123 --> 18:03.500
We seriously thought you might
marry that piece of shit!

18:05.585 --> 18:08.755
Well, you know he -- he actually
had some good qualities too.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.548
Uhh, yeah, like what?
Racism?

18:10.715 --> 18:12.258
Or the sociopath part?

18:14.969 --> 18:16.429
Yeah, I mean,
no offense, Heidi,

18:16.596 --> 18:18.181
but what the fuck
were you thinking?!

18:18.348 --> 18:19.682
Guys, she's admitted
she made a mistake.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.601
You make a mistake
on your homework.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.895
What Heidi did was more like
a momentary loss of all sanity.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.109
It was just
what I believed in.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.735
Don't worry, Heidi,

18:30.902 --> 18:32.028
we're not gonna keep telling you
we told you so!

18:32.195 --> 18:34.489
But we told you so!

18:34.656 --> 18:36.366
The only thing
I wanna know is

18:36.533 --> 18:38.618
how did you bring yourself
to actually <i>kiss</i> him?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.578
Ew!

18:40.745 --> 18:42.997
Can you imagine? Eric
Cartman's breath on your mouth?

18:43.164 --> 18:45.166
- Ew!
- Ugh!

18:45.333 --> 18:46.584
Heidi, come here.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.044
I want to kiss you
with my tongue!

18:48.211 --> 18:50.338
Ew!

19:00.140 --> 19:01.432
Hi, Eric.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.226
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

19:03.393 --> 19:06.146
I don't know.
I think I...

19:06.312 --> 19:08.148
I just wanna make sure...

19:08.314 --> 19:09.816
you're doing okay.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.861
I want you to know...
I'll always care about you.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.612
That's good to know
'cause, like,

19:14.779 --> 19:16.156
nothing helps more
when you're down

19:16.322 --> 19:17.448
than knowing that your
girlfriend who broke up with you

19:17.615 --> 19:19.701
might care.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.578
I'm sorry
that I've hurt you.

19:21.744 --> 19:24.747
I think maybe I am just stupid
and I don't know what I want,

19:24.914 --> 19:26.666
and it ends up
hurting people.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.877
No...

19:29.043 --> 19:31.671
You need to know something,
Heidi...

19:31.838 --> 19:33.506
None of this
is your fault.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.966
- But I'm the one who--
- No.

19:35.133 --> 19:38.636
Heidi,
none of this is <i>yo ur</i> fault.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.680
There's stuff
I never told you.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.432
It's time...

19:42.599 --> 19:43.600
It's time I did.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.618
- Hey.
- Hey! You all set to go?

20:01.784 --> 20:04.078
I wanted to talk to you
first.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.080
Okay, sure.

20:06.247 --> 20:09.334
Kyle, I've been under
a lot of stress lately,

20:09.500 --> 20:12.295
and it was all making me
really confused.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.339
Yeah,
that's understandable.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.425
I was being manipulated,
and I didn't even see it.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.260
I never do.
And...

20:19.427 --> 20:21.262
I don't think you saw it either,
Kyle.

20:21.429 --> 20:22.931
What do you mean?

20:23.097 --> 20:25.850
I've come to realize that
it's not my fault,

20:26.017 --> 20:27.685
it's <i>yo ur</i> fault, Kyle.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.687
You made all this happen.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.814
- Made me question who I was --
- But, Heidi, I thought--

20:31.981 --> 20:34.943
Shh. But it's okay.
You can't help it.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.570
It's how you were raised...
what you were taught.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.323
My heritage is Irish,
so I'm prone to being moody.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.660
And you're heritage...
well, you know...

20:43.826 --> 20:45.495
You can be a little sneaky
sometimes

20:45.662 --> 20:47.205
and not even realize it.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.085
I'm sorry, Kyle, but...

20:52.252 --> 20:54.254
everybody's trying to live life
the best they can.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.964
It's hard enough

20:56.130 --> 20:57.799
without your people
always trying to get ahead.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.762
Dude...

21:02.929 --> 21:04.847
did she just call me
a dirty Jew?

21:14.065 --> 21:17.568
♪ Happy anniversary to you... ♪
Cha, cha, cha.

21:17.735 --> 21:21.114
♪ Happy anniversary to you... ♪
Cha, cha, cha.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.575
♪ Happy anniversary,
Mr. President... ♪

21:24.742 --> 21:28.830
♪ Happy anniversary to you ♪

21:28.997 --> 21:31.291
Congratulations, Mr. President.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.502
Looks like many more years
of the same are to come.

21:34.669 --> 21:37.755
Oh, I don't think so...

21:37.922 --> 21:40.800
I think the next three years
are going to be even better.
