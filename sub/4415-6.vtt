Russ: <i>My work is in the ghetto.</i>

00:03.464 --> 00:05.367
Lina: <i>I don't have an office.</i>

00:05.387 --> 00:06.546
Russ: <i>My commute is longer.</i>

00:06.566 --> 00:07.674
Lina: You get paid more.

00:07.694 --> 00:10.319
Well, I have to manage employees.

00:10.321 --> 00:12.404
Lina: I have to manage second-graders.

00:12.406 --> 00:14.874
I don't understand.
Why are we having this fight again?

00:14.894 --> 00:17.950
Because you still won't admit
that my job is worse than yours.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.690
- Because I... (crashing)
- Shh.

00:21.658 --> 00:23.246
What was that?

00:24.450 --> 00:26.984
I don't know.
It sounded like it came from the backyard.

00:27.004 --> 00:28.253
(dog barks)

00:30.013 --> 00:31.724
This is exactly the home invasion

00:31.726 --> 00:33.592
we always talked about
needing to be prepared for

00:33.594 --> 00:34.843
and we never did.

00:34.845 --> 00:36.345
You're gonna get killed.

00:36.347 --> 00:37.763
I'm gonna get raped and killed.

00:37.765 --> 00:39.264
Don't be so sure about the order.

00:39.266 --> 00:41.084
Can you see anything?

00:41.456 --> 00:43.402
Russ: No.

00:44.158 --> 00:45.604
I'm sure it's probably fine.

00:45.606 --> 00:46.855
Lina, come on. (gasps)

00:46.857 --> 00:48.440
(screams)

00:48.837 --> 00:51.517
There's a man in the backyard.

00:52.727 --> 00:55.135

Frankie: Thanks.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.838
(dishes clinking)

01:10.347 --> 01:12.464
Lina:
Judah's been moving stuff in all morning.

01:12.466 --> 01:14.600
- Who's Judah?
- He is the creepy guy

01:14.602 --> 01:16.135
who lives in the guesthouse.

01:16.137 --> 01:18.172
Can't we just kick him out?

01:18.192 --> 01:19.805
He's a renter, just like us.

01:20.158 --> 01:21.140
Ella: I don't get it.

01:21.142 --> 01:23.653
We rent the main house, he rents the back.

01:23.673 --> 01:25.205
We're poor.

01:25.403 --> 01:26.930
You poor people have IPads.

01:26.950 --> 01:28.530
Grandma bought them.

01:28.550 --> 01:29.262
That's not the point.

01:29.282 --> 01:31.236
Nina said that that guy
would never be around

01:31.256 --> 01:33.573
and now he's creeping around
in the middle of the night...

01:33.593 --> 01:34.604
It was 9:30.

01:34.606 --> 01:36.606
To me, that's the middle of the night.

01:38.218 --> 01:39.776
(knocking at door)

01:40.030 --> 01:41.778
Hello?

01:42.984 --> 01:44.081
Hey.

01:44.101 --> 01:46.124
Hey, you don't have any of my mail, do you?

01:46.144 --> 01:48.469
- Uh...
- Um, I might. I can look.

01:48.489 --> 01:50.214
Well, thanks, man.

01:50.504 --> 01:52.504
Just let me know if you find anything.

01:52.506 --> 01:55.493
Oh, you'll probably be seeing
a lot more of me around here now.

01:55.513 --> 01:56.572
Why is that?

01:56.592 --> 02:00.479
Well, Russ, I was kind of
living full-time with my lady.

02:00.481 --> 02:01.680
That's over now.

02:01.682 --> 02:03.849
Oh. Well, um, you know,

02:03.851 --> 02:05.267
maybe you guys can work things out.

02:05.269 --> 02:06.768
(scoffs)

02:06.770 --> 02:08.687
No chance. No.

02:08.972 --> 02:11.156
I did some pretty bad shit.

02:11.158 --> 02:13.108
She's gone for good.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.160
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

02:15.450 --> 02:16.834
Thanks, man.

02:19.033 --> 02:20.365
(door closes)

02:20.367 --> 02:21.587
Wow.

02:21.607 --> 02:24.002
I wonder what bad shit he did.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.787
Did you see that?

02:25.789 --> 02:27.539
- What?
- He couldn't even look at me.

02:27.541 --> 02:30.079
He didn't even acknowledge anything I said.

02:33.815 --> 02:35.775
Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something?

02:40.221 --> 02:43.055
Lina:
<i>I want you to add it all up and write down</i>

02:43.057 --> 02:45.057
the number. All right.

02:45.059 --> 02:47.025
Ugh, get out of my chair.

02:47.027 --> 02:48.477
Come on.

02:48.479 --> 02:51.148
But it's so cool.
You have your own chair.

02:51.168 --> 02:53.065
But you let Mikey sit in your chair.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.316
I like Mikey.

02:54.318 --> 02:55.567
(knocking at door)

02:57.175 --> 02:58.654
Do you have a minute?

02:58.656 --> 03:00.489
CHILDREN: Ooh!

03:00.491 --> 03:02.074
Really?

03:02.076 --> 03:04.376
Finish math.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.662
(door closes)

03:06.664 --> 03:08.608
So I just talked to Betty,

03:08.628 --> 03:12.384
and she said her recovery is
going quicker than expected

03:12.386 --> 03:14.586
and she'll be back earlier.

03:15.497 --> 03:18.423
It's okay.
Nothing lasts forever.

03:18.425 --> 03:19.725
When's my last day?

03:19.727 --> 03:22.728
Well, that's the thing.
We really don't want to lose you.

03:22.730 --> 03:24.205
Well,

03:24.225 --> 03:27.766
I... really don't...

03:28.332 --> 03:29.735
want to go.

03:29.737 --> 03:32.899
What if we offered you something permanent?

03:34.657 --> 03:36.692
How permanent?

03:39.956 --> 03:41.060
Russ.

03:41.842 --> 03:43.766
Um, you need to talk to Bernie.
People are getting upset.

03:43.786 --> 03:45.928
Ugh. What did he do this time?

03:46.474 --> 03:48.385
"Grandpa."

03:48.405 --> 03:50.160
Who's Grandpa?

03:53.895 --> 03:55.043
Bernie.

03:55.045 --> 03:56.962
Oh. Hey, Russ.

03:56.964 --> 04:00.132
Hey, do I look older to you?

04:00.134 --> 04:02.134
(laughs)

04:02.136 --> 04:03.385
That is "Grandpa"?

04:03.535 --> 04:05.804
In the flesh. Bernie,

04:05.806 --> 04:07.472
the office is no place for Grandpa.

04:07.474 --> 04:08.890
Whoa, Russ.

04:08.892 --> 04:10.444
I'm gonna have to report you to HR.

04:10.464 --> 04:13.612
- <i>You're</i> reporting <i> me?</i>
- Yeah, for age discrimination.

04:13.614 --> 04:14.725
(chuckling) Come on.

04:14.745 --> 04:16.231
You have to stop doing that at work.

04:16.233 --> 04:17.565
Are you sure, Russ?

04:17.567 --> 04:19.985
Isn't this something of a gray area?

04:20.351 --> 04:21.486
I'm serious.

04:21.488 --> 04:23.739
- You can't do that joke here.
- Oh.

04:23.741 --> 04:26.718
Can't? Or won't?

04:27.016 --> 04:28.269
Hmm?

04:30.282 --> 04:32.082
Hey, guys.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.750
Check out my pubes.

04:34.770 --> 04:35.705
(dog barking)

04:35.725 --> 04:37.836
Lina: <i>I'd be a teacher's aide.</i>

04:37.838 --> 04:39.921
That's not even a real teacher.

04:39.923 --> 04:41.173
So what?

04:41.175 --> 04:43.227
So, I don't know, subs are cooler.

04:43.247 --> 04:44.926
They're in and out.

04:44.928 --> 04:46.178
They're like hit men.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.263
I don't know if I want to commit

04:48.265 --> 04:51.034
to the same class for an entire year.

04:51.054 --> 04:52.412
But we need the extra money.

04:52.432 --> 04:55.320
- Maybe we should downsize.
- The family?

04:55.322 --> 04:57.450
It's easier to get a
hotel room with two kids.

04:57.723 --> 04:58.607
Look,

04:58.609 --> 05:01.602
just take the job and if you hate it,
you can quit.

05:01.622 --> 05:04.162
- Mommy's a quitter.
- See? (Lina gasps)

05:04.164 --> 05:06.132
Every decision you make affects them.

05:06.152 --> 05:07.621
Why do I have to be a role model?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.868
Isn't that what celebrities are for?

05:13.621 --> 05:14.706
No way.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.375
Hmm?

05:16.859 --> 05:19.678
This came for Judah.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.964
It's from the state parole board.

05:22.966 --> 05:24.850
- What?
- Yeah.

05:24.852 --> 05:27.853
I told you that he was into some bad shit.

05:28.059 --> 05:29.855
I knew it.

05:32.872 --> 05:34.541
Abby: <i>This is so cool.</i>
I mean, if you get this job,

05:34.561 --> 05:35.558
we can hang out every day.

05:35.578 --> 05:38.257
Or we can be real friends
instead of just work friends.

05:38.277 --> 05:41.000
- I thought we were real friends.
- You know what I mean.

05:41.136 --> 05:42.625
- I guess so, yeah.
- Why are they hiring me?

05:42.645 --> 05:44.809
Don't they know what a bad attitude I have?

05:44.829 --> 05:46.820
Yeah. If they need a
reference, they can call me.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.553
- I can confirm.
- You know, you shouldn't complain.

05:49.555 --> 05:50.882
People actually value you.

05:50.902 --> 05:53.140
- My ex-partners thought I was worthless.
- Lina: You know what?

05:53.160 --> 05:55.324
I will take your huge buyout settlement

05:55.344 --> 05:56.640
and you be a teacher's aide.

05:56.660 --> 06:00.648
You know what?
Rich people have problems, too.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.054
I know.

06:02.074 --> 06:03.990
They just don't matter. Mm.

06:04.010 --> 06:06.236
So did Lina tell you about the murderer

06:06.238 --> 06:07.738
we have living in our guesthouse?

06:07.740 --> 06:08.954
- No.
- What?

06:08.974 --> 06:11.492
No. I don't want them to make fun of me.

06:11.494 --> 06:13.077
- Aw, it's cute.
- Ugh.

06:13.097 --> 06:14.491
No, there's no murderer. There's a guy

06:14.511 --> 06:16.688
who got a letter from the parole board.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.574
Uh, yeah. About murder.

06:18.594 --> 06:20.104
You didn't give him his letter?

06:20.124 --> 06:23.470
I couldn't, because then he would know
that I knew abouthe thing.

06:23.472 --> 06:26.027
- Who thinks I should open it?
- I definitely do.

06:26.047 --> 06:28.426
Okay, as your lawyer,
I have to tell you that A,

06:28.446 --> 06:30.844
opening his mail is a felony.

06:32.347 --> 06:33.253
And B,

06:33.273 --> 06:35.015
the letter's not gonna tell
you what his crime was.

06:35.035 --> 06:37.373
Crap. Why didn't you tell me that first?

06:37.420 --> 06:39.420
Because I thought that
the whole federal crime

06:39.422 --> 06:41.422
part of it would be a stronger deterrent.

06:41.424 --> 06:43.810
You're fired. We need to hire a new lawyer.

06:43.830 --> 06:45.560
Maybe he just screwed up once.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.831
Doesn't make him a murderer.
I've made mistakes.

06:47.851 --> 06:49.063
Would you guys have a problem with me

06:49.065 --> 06:51.099
staying in your guesthouse, would you?

06:51.101 --> 06:52.850
I think you know the answer to that.

06:52.852 --> 06:54.852
Well, it's your loss. I'm a model tenant.

06:54.854 --> 06:57.605
Well, how do I find out about
this guy? I mean, who is he?

06:57.607 --> 07:00.742
What's his deal? Who did he murder?

07:00.744 --> 07:02.202
We need your help.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.877
I can't help you. You just fired me.

07:03.897 --> 07:06.347
- You're hired again.
- Great. I'll make some calls.

07:06.367 --> 07:09.898
Yes, thank you.
She's been a <i> little</i> obsessed.

07:10.518 --> 07:12.094
Murder.

07:16.126 --> 07:17.625
Russ: There you go.

07:17.627 --> 07:19.260
All right, everybody in.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.133
Hi, Judah.

07:22.153 --> 07:23.891
- Hey, Russ.
- Russ: Hey.

07:26.273 --> 07:27.635
Did you see that?

07:28.035 --> 07:30.638
That guy is so guilty about killing a woman

07:30.640 --> 07:32.640
that he won't even look at one.

07:32.642 --> 07:34.475
- Maybe it's cultural.
- What does that mean?

07:34.477 --> 07:36.611
It means that in some cultures,

07:36.613 --> 07:38.646
it's more respectful to ignore women.

07:38.648 --> 07:40.240
I don't know.

07:41.744 --> 07:43.818
I think that we might need to call in sick

07:43.820 --> 07:45.380
and figure out what this guy's deal is.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.156
We need to do this. For the children.

07:48.158 --> 07:49.289
- For the children?
- Yeah.

07:49.309 --> 07:52.642
- We could all call in sick.
- No. No one is calling in sick, okay?

07:52.662 --> 07:56.638
Mommy... has a big decision to make.

07:56.658 --> 07:58.797
And she thinks that
if she doesn't go to work,

07:58.817 --> 08:00.634
then work will make it for her.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.202
That's not accurate.

08:02.222 --> 08:05.506
Don't listen to your dad this one time.

08:05.508 --> 08:07.758
(door closes, engine starts) Bye.

08:08.753 --> 08:10.962
Have a good day <i> at work.</i>

08:31.435 --> 08:33.284
(whispering): Hey, Magnus, it's Lina.

08:33.285 --> 08:35.203
Look, I... um, sorry for the short notice,

08:35.205 --> 08:38.539
but I am not gonna be
able to make it in today.

08:38.541 --> 08:40.508
I have a family emergency.

08:41.561 --> 08:43.981
Okay. Oh, I got to go. Bye.

08:51.768 --> 08:53.908
Hey, Russ, did you talk to Bernie yet?

08:53.928 --> 08:55.523
Uh, about what?

08:55.525 --> 08:59.560
- You were supposed to fire him.
- What? You're firing Bernie?

08:59.562 --> 09:01.562
Sorry. There's something wrong

09:01.564 --> 09:03.767
with my calendar updates.
I thought I told you already.

09:03.787 --> 09:06.067
Look, I-I... He's just not

09:06.069 --> 09:08.119
used to corporate environments.
Let me ju...

09:08.121 --> 09:11.126
- I'll just talk to him.
- No, we already hired his replacement.

09:13.290 --> 09:16.578
Gil, come on. I can't fire him.

09:17.013 --> 09:18.750
He was your hire.

09:26.663 --> 09:28.281
Hey. You're not gonna believe this.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.840
I have to fire Bernie right now.

09:29.842 --> 09:31.842
- Lina: Oh, my God, that's terrible.
- I know.

09:31.844 --> 09:34.228
- What are you gonna do?
- I-I... I don't know.

09:34.230 --> 09:36.847
I don't think I have a-a choice.

09:37.322 --> 09:39.134
Why are you whispering?

09:40.189 --> 09:42.603
I followed the murderer to a bookstore.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.940
He's in the travel section.

09:48.153 --> 09:51.324
What about work? Did you
tell them that you're gonna take that job?

09:51.523 --> 09:52.697
Forget about the job.

09:52.699 --> 09:54.949
Judah's buying travel books.

09:54.951 --> 09:56.951
To places we don't have an
extradition treaty with.

09:56.953 --> 09:59.372
So you're sabotaging your job.

09:59.392 --> 10:01.455
You're sabotaging my life.

10:01.457 --> 10:03.291
(scoffs) Fine.

10:03.293 --> 10:05.293
Do what you got to do.

10:25.238 --> 10:25.813
Bernie: <i>Hey.</i>

10:25.815 --> 10:27.648
Do I look older to you?

10:30.403 --> 10:32.127
- Uh, Bernie.
- Hey.

10:32.147 --> 10:34.956
- Hey, what's up, Russ?
- Hey. So, uh...

10:36.470 --> 10:39.160
So... this is really important.

10:39.877 --> 10:42.707
And... difficult.

10:43.377 --> 10:46.500
And... maybe unfair.

10:47.584 --> 10:49.221
What's going on?

10:53.426 --> 10:57.039
I have to leave work early today
to help Lina with something.

10:58.441 --> 11:00.404
(sighs) That is unfair.

11:04.487 --> 11:05.853
Huh.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.489
Oh, hey, do you know a good waxer?

11:08.693 --> 11:10.491
No?

11:21.788 --> 11:24.684
Ugh, I froze... I just couldn't do it.

11:24.704 --> 11:25.623
You know, it's Bernie.

11:25.625 --> 11:27.620
I get it...
he's helped us out so many times.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.419
I know, and now I have to fire him?

11:29.439 --> 11:31.128
I mean, it's bullshit.

11:31.130 --> 11:32.463
How do you fire a friend?

11:32.465 --> 11:34.072
(whispering): Look.

11:35.301 --> 11:36.884
He's buying sandpaper.

11:36.886 --> 11:39.303
Obviously trying to
remove his fingerprints.

11:39.305 --> 11:41.305
Or he's refinishing furniture,

11:41.307 --> 11:43.891
but, sure, he's removing fingerprints.

11:43.893 --> 11:45.309
This is why we're such a good team.

11:45.311 --> 11:48.813
You're the by-the-book guy to keep
a loose cannon like me in line.

11:48.815 --> 11:52.066
I solve the crime,
you file the paperwork.

12:15.137 --> 12:16.307
Holy shit.

12:16.309 --> 12:20.261
A convicted criminal has a bow saw,
bleach and sandpaper.

12:20.263 --> 12:21.729
What more do you need?

12:21.731 --> 12:23.180
Evidence?

12:24.001 --> 12:26.767
Damn, you really are by the book.

12:37.095 --> 12:38.612
Come on, come w us?

12:38.614 --> 12:40.614
Maybe not... (cell phone chimes)

12:40.616 --> 12:43.250
but we should probably stay
in here until he leaves.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.953
- Damn.
- Hmm?

12:45.955 --> 12:49.079
The school wants an answer
by the end of the day.

12:50.793 --> 12:52.082
How can I even think about that

12:52.102 --> 12:55.096
when I'm trying to protect
my kids from a serial killer?

12:55.098 --> 12:56.097
Stop.

12:56.099 --> 12:57.465
Come on.

12:57.467 --> 12:59.467
- You're doing it again.
- What?

12:59.469 --> 13:01.302
Using our kids as an excuse.

13:01.304 --> 13:04.138
If you don't want to take the job,
don't take the job,

13:04.140 --> 13:08.538
but don't pretend like we're
out here protecting our kids.

13:08.674 --> 13:10.660
A teacher's aide.

13:12.136 --> 13:14.782
When I was ten,
I thought I was gonna be an astronaut.

13:14.784 --> 13:15.983
(chuckles)

13:15.985 --> 13:18.068
Do astronauts have to fire people?

13:19.071 --> 13:20.070
(gasps)

13:20.072 --> 13:22.156
What is going on in here?

13:22.414 --> 13:25.075
Uh, how much are the sheds?

13:32.154 --> 13:33.321
Bernie?

13:33.842 --> 13:34.835
Oh, hey.

13:34.837 --> 13:36.253
You're still here.

13:36.255 --> 13:38.088
How are you still here?

13:38.500 --> 13:41.304
(scoffs) I'll be here all week,
thank you very much.

13:43.005 --> 13:44.762
That's an expression comedians use.

13:44.764 --> 13:47.598
Actually, I have
another printing job I go to on Thursdays,

13:47.600 --> 13:49.433
but, uh, try the veal.

13:49.435 --> 13:50.935
What veal?

13:51.371 --> 13:53.938
Okay, that's a very common comedy thing.

13:53.940 --> 13:55.880
Hey, did you speak to Russ?

13:55.900 --> 13:59.160
Yeah, he said he had to leave early,
something to do with his wife.

13:59.619 --> 14:02.029
Why don't you take the rest of the day off,
too?

14:02.031 --> 14:03.030
Ah.

14:03.032 --> 14:04.498
Now that sounds fair.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.656
All right, thanks, boss.

14:06.676 --> 14:08.494
- And Bernie?
- Yeah.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.472
Would you speak to Russ
as soon as possible?

14:11.745 --> 14:13.040
All right.

14:17.797 --> 14:19.988
Lina: He's altering his appearance.

14:20.008 --> 14:23.487
Okay,
I will admit that is kind of suspicious.

14:23.507 --> 14:24.885
Yeah.

14:26.845 --> 14:28.781
Lina: He's gone.

14:29.997 --> 14:31.392
(gasps)

14:34.252 --> 14:35.396
Wow.

14:35.398 --> 14:37.168
BOTH: Hi.

14:37.733 --> 14:39.200
Are you guys following me?

14:39.202 --> 14:40.201
Lina: What? No.

14:40.203 --> 14:41.569
That's crazy.

14:41.571 --> 14:43.037
No, we were just, uh...

14:43.039 --> 14:45.406
we were just getting couples haircuts.

14:45.408 --> 14:47.118
Jack and Jills.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.695
I thought I saw you
at the hardware store.

14:52.715 --> 14:55.082
Oh, no, we-we get that a lot.

14:55.084 --> 14:57.334
Yeah.

14:59.430 --> 15:00.387
Okay.

15:01.615 --> 15:03.265
See you later, Russ.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.681
(sighs) What a creep.

15:11.037 --> 15:13.734
Aren't we the creeps here?

15:14.847 --> 15:17.905
(sighs) Why do you always take his side?

15:23.125 --> 15:25.289
Why do I need to take a stupid job?

15:25.309 --> 15:27.448
Yeah. Or maybe I can just quit my job.

15:27.450 --> 15:29.807
- Yeah.
- We can just raise cattle.

15:29.827 --> 15:31.752
Russ. Look.

15:32.879 --> 15:35.051
Why is our door open?

15:35.597 --> 15:37.297
Stay here.

15:39.641 --> 15:41.545
(door creaking)

15:43.550 --> 15:45.349
Somebody in here?

15:50.159 --> 15:51.648
Hello?

15:53.373 --> 15:54.975
(chair squeaking)

15:55.817 --> 15:58.039
I hear we need to talk.

16:01.990 --> 16:04.485
Bernie (chuckles): <i>That was classic.
Should have seen your guys' faces.</i>

16:04.505 --> 16:05.937
Yeah, it was a good one, Bernie.

16:05.957 --> 16:07.766
We really believed we
were about to be killed.

16:07.786 --> 16:09.440
Really? Good.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.773
So, uh,
Gil said you had something to say to me.

16:11.793 --> 16:13.262
Um...

16:14.197 --> 16:17.532
Yeah. Well, you know, firstly,

16:17.534 --> 16:20.548
- um, I want to thank you for... you know.
- Oh.

16:20.568 --> 16:23.454
You've just always been such
a great friend, you know,

16:23.456 --> 16:25.456
and-and I really
appreciate what you've done

16:25.458 --> 16:29.289
- for me and-and my family.
- Gil told you to say that?

16:29.309 --> 16:30.211
What?

16:30.213 --> 16:33.139
No, I... Look, the thing is,

16:33.159 --> 16:36.717
Gil and, um, well,

16:36.719 --> 16:38.719
some of the people at-at work,

16:39.133 --> 16:41.689
they don't always appreciate,

16:41.691 --> 16:44.559
you know, your-your heart,
you know, your...

16:44.561 --> 16:47.003
how you have such a great,
you know, big heart.

16:47.023 --> 16:49.397
But I-I do.

16:50.813 --> 16:53.016
Russ, are you hitting on me?

16:53.529 --> 16:55.036
(knocking)

16:55.038 --> 16:56.737
(groans) Hold on a sec.

16:59.225 --> 17:01.042
Hey. Good timing.

17:01.044 --> 17:03.878
- Simple assault.
- What?

17:03.880 --> 17:05.546
Your friend in the guesthouse,

17:05.548 --> 17:07.882
his conviction was for simple assault.

17:07.884 --> 17:09.469
Lina: Did you just say "assault"?

17:09.489 --> 17:12.596
- Simple assault.
- What is simple assault?

17:12.616 --> 17:15.256
It's basically the
pussiest form of assault.

17:15.258 --> 17:16.257
There.

17:16.259 --> 17:17.662
Oh.

17:17.682 --> 17:20.011
- Simple assault. Right?
- Thank you.

17:20.012 --> 17:22.930
So I really don't think you guys
have anything to worry about.

17:22.932 --> 17:24.932
You haven't even seen this guy.

17:24.934 --> 17:27.184
Russ and I have been following him all day,

17:27.185 --> 17:29.103
and I am telling you, there is something up

17:29.105 --> 17:31.522
- with this dude.
- So you stalked him

17:31.524 --> 17:33.608
- but he's dangerous?
- He is dangerous.

17:33.610 --> 17:35.512
- He won't look me in the eye.
- Yeah.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.745
That's because you have
crazy eyes right now.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.366
(dogs barking)

17:38.386 --> 17:39.713
Is that him?

17:41.501 --> 17:44.035
What is he doing in the backyard?

17:44.037 --> 17:46.824
- He's burying something.
- Russ: Oh, here we go.

17:46.844 --> 17:49.707
- I'm serious. What if it's a body?
- It's not a body.

17:49.709 --> 17:52.126
What if it's a time capsule,
like, from 1982?

17:52.128 --> 17:54.378
Enough with 1982.

17:54.380 --> 17:57.298
It wasn't a great year for everybody, okay?

17:57.300 --> 18:00.217
Lina: All right, he's leaving.
Russ, I need you to get a shovel.

18:00.219 --> 18:01.469
I'm gonna get a flashlight.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.938
- Bernie, you're the lookout.
- Okay.

18:06.882 --> 18:08.731
You're not digging fast enough.

18:08.751 --> 18:11.894
Are you kidding?
You can take over at any time.

18:12.115 --> 18:13.731
Bernie: Guys, guys, guys,

18:13.733 --> 18:15.399
guys, um, Judah's coming.

18:15.401 --> 18:17.401
Yeah, Judah's here. What's happening?

18:17.403 --> 18:19.070
- There he is.
- Lina: Oh, my God.

18:19.072 --> 18:21.480
Really? Can... Let me fire him, please?
Can I do it?

18:21.500 --> 18:23.217
Russ,
were you trying to fire me back there?

18:23.237 --> 18:25.826
- No, I... You...
- Judah: I can't believe

18:25.828 --> 18:27.328
- you did this.
- Lina: Did what,

18:27.330 --> 18:29.757
- found the body?
- Destroyed my herb garden.

18:30.278 --> 18:33.531
- What body?
- Your ex-girlfriend that you murdered.

18:33.551 --> 18:35.627
Russ, you think I murdered
my ex-girlfriend?

18:35.628 --> 18:38.973
- Lina: I think it. I do.
- Bernie: Okay, can we put a pin

18:38.975 --> 18:42.510
in murder? Uh, Russ,

18:42.512 --> 18:44.178
- am I fired?
- No.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.013
- I... No.
- Russ, you think I murdered somebody,

18:46.015 --> 18:47.598
my ex-girlfriend?

18:47.600 --> 18:49.684
No, I... Yes, you're fired.

18:49.686 --> 18:51.352
I'm so sorry, okay?

18:51.354 --> 18:54.105
But you did say you did
some bad shit to your ex.

18:54.107 --> 18:56.607
Judah: Yeah, Russ, I cheated on her.

18:56.609 --> 18:57.858
And got a stripper pregnant.

18:57.860 --> 18:59.160
Huh.

18:59.162 --> 19:01.162
I know how that boat floats, man.

19:01.164 --> 19:03.864
Judah: I'm not proud of it,
but I didn't murder anything.

19:03.866 --> 19:05.424
Except that pussy.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.451
Wait, then why did you
change your appearance?

19:07.453 --> 19:08.576
What's up with that?

19:08.596 --> 19:11.455
For a parole meeting I have coming up.

19:11.852 --> 19:14.390
If they'd ever send me the damn letter.

19:19.552 --> 19:21.849
He looked at me.

19:21.851 --> 19:24.685
(Lina moaning loudly)

19:24.687 --> 19:26.554
Oh... Lina.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.558
Oh...

19:30.560 --> 19:32.226
Lina...

19:32.228 --> 19:34.478
(moaning)

19:34.480 --> 19:36.312
(muffled moan)

19:36.332 --> 19:38.399
Oh, my God.

19:39.216 --> 19:40.368
Holy shit.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.393
Whoa.

19:43.994 --> 19:47.291
I think we should become
amateur detectives, 'cause...

19:47.595 --> 19:50.378
I mean, just for the sake of our sex life.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.580
Hmm. I won't have time.

19:53.415 --> 19:56.500
I'm gonna take that job at the school.

19:56.502 --> 19:58.252
You are?

19:58.691 --> 20:00.337
You really don't have to.

20:00.339 --> 20:02.673
No, I'm okay with it.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.343
But I'd like it if you played
hooky with me every once

20:06.345 --> 20:09.397
- in a while.
- Absolutely.

20:09.925 --> 20:12.767
I mean, if Judah did murder his girlfriend,

20:12.769 --> 20:16.896
how smart would it be to
plant rosemary over it?

20:17.700 --> 20:20.349
Should I grab the shovel?

20:20.351 --> 20:21.840
I'm too tired.

20:23.801 --> 20:26.667
I'm fine letting him get away with it.

20:27.474 --> 20:29.546
This time.

20:33.051 --> 20:34.430
Russ: <i>You sure you're not mad?</i>

20:34.450 --> 20:36.825
No. It's for the best.

20:37.259 --> 20:38.835
No offense, Russ,

20:38.855 --> 20:41.274
no one around here has a sense of humor.

20:41.937 --> 20:44.546
What I'm worried about is
what my next gig's gonna be.

20:44.566 --> 20:47.933
It's hard to find work... at my age.

20:49.125 --> 20:51.135
Oh, shit.

20:51.155 --> 20:53.627
Where is it?
Where is that thing?

20:57.027 --> 20:58.888
You didn't happen to see
a curly gray wig around?

20:58.908 --> 21:00.402
No.

21:00.973 --> 21:03.371
Well, that's probably for the best, too.

21:04.526 --> 21:06.697
Rest in peace, Grandpa.

21:06.821 --> 21:08.509
He will be missed.
