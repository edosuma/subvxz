11:31.090 --> 11:33.991
I only got one thing to say.
Quarterfinals, yeah!

11:36.896 --> 11:39.194
Best game he's had
so far.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.130
Luke Cafferty,
come on up here.

11:43.736 --> 11:45.931
So now you're saying
we're on the chopping block.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.131
Oh, it's not just you.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.434
Football brings in money.

11:48.507 --> 11:49.940
And it costs, too.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.136
Right now,
you are revenue neutral.

11:52.244 --> 11:53.438
What do you mean,
revenue neutral?

11:53.512 --> 11:57.778
What I am saying is the board meets
in 10 days to make their final cuts.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.048
Football is a big target.

12:00.486 --> 12:02.386
You need to make the cuts
before they do.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.649
Taylor,
this is serious.

12:06.358 --> 12:07.347
Hey.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.122
You've got my back,
don't you?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.027
I always do, Taylor.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.027
All the way to State!

12:18.104 --> 12:19.469
All the way to State!

12:19.538 --> 12:22.405
ALL: All the way to State!
All the way to State!

12:46.332 --> 12:47.822
TAYLOR: Here I am trying
to take a team to State,

12:47.900 --> 12:50.630
and Levi's got me counting
pens and paperclips.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.330
One week he's wasting
money on banquets,

12:52.404 --> 12:53.666
offering me contracts.

12:53.739 --> 12:54.763
The next week,
he wants me

12:54.840 --> 12:56.102
to cut the budget
down to bare bones.

12:56.175 --> 12:57.733
I've got Spivey,
I've got Stan,

12:57.810 --> 13:00.836
I've got Crowley, I've got Billy.
All on stipends.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.881
That money is just about to disappear.
What am I supposed to do?

13:02.948 --> 13:04.745
Boost the team myself?
I had another conversation

13:04.817 --> 13:06.614
with that Dana Wheldon
from Braemore.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.614
And they want me to
come do that interview.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.881
And I think
I'd really like to do it.

13:17.263 --> 13:21.962
The thing about it is that it is
going to be two Fridays from now.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.126
That's during the semis.

13:25.571 --> 13:26.595

13:26.705 --> 13:28.366
You can't do it
some other time?

13:28.440 --> 13:29.634
Apparently they're...

13:30.242 --> 13:32.437
It's really hard to get
people's schedules together.

13:32.511 --> 13:33.944
There are going to be several
people in the meeting.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.311
The president of the
college might be there.

13:36.415 --> 13:38.349
It's just
an exciting opportunity,

13:38.417 --> 13:41.443
you know, after all these
years in high school.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.990

Come here, Mom.

13:48.093 --> 13:49.958

I'll be right there.

14:05.611 --> 14:06.908
You're gonna
drop the ball there?

14:06.979 --> 14:08.037
Don't just put that
ball on the ground.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.273
You hand him the ball.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.810
Turn around,
we do it again.

I don't care, we'll be out
here all day, every day.

a stupid mistake.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.081

14:16.155 --> 14:17.588
I got something for you.

14:18.457 --> 14:21.790

high school football coach.

14:21.894 --> 14:24.294

14:24.730 --> 14:26.391

14:26.632 --> 14:27.929

You're a pest.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.092
Let's go!

14:31.770 --> 14:33.135
BILLY: So, anyway, once
the season is over with,

14:33.205 --> 14:35.696
they're gonna have to let a bunch of
coaches go because of budget cuts.

14:35.774 --> 14:36.968
I mean,
Crowley will be there

14:37.076 --> 14:38.509
'cause he's, like,
Coach's right-hand man.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.171
And Spivey, you know,
he's all right, I guess.

14:42.114 --> 14:43.706
But that guy Stan...
You've met Stan.

14:43.782 --> 14:45.147
The guy's
a friggin' weirdo, man.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.845

that everyone says, it's annoying.

us to the game, you can.

on the bus or whatever.

your seventh beer.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.637
You're not gonna
hear me complain.

22:25.944 --> 22:27.275
Why'd you
let her work here?

22:27.379 --> 22:28.505
She's a stripper, Tim.

22:28.580 --> 22:29.569
That's what she does.

22:29.681 --> 22:30.705
I meant Becky.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.545
BILLY: I didn't even know
she was working here.

22:32.617 --> 22:34.744
Honestly. She came up here
one night with Mindy and...

22:34.820 --> 22:36.913
No, no, no, no.
You could have stopped it.

22:36.988 --> 22:38.182
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

22:38.256 --> 22:40.554
She's just waitressing, Tim.
It's not like she's stripping.

22:41.093 --> 22:44.153
And part of that money that she's
making is helping to go pay rent.

22:44.229 --> 22:46.857
And that rent is actually helping
to pay for your land that you got.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.258
Didn't ask for that.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.301
You may not have asked for it,
but that's the way things are.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.098
Times are
a little tight, Tim.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.737
I thought times
were good, Billy.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.271
So now you're
just a liar.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.001
Okay.
Take it easy, all right?

22:57.075 --> 22:58.474
She may as well
be stripping.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.737
Where you going?

22:59.811 --> 23:00.835
Hey!

23:01.413 --> 23:02.505
Hey, leave her alone.

23:02.581 --> 23:03.809
Tim, it's okay.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.645
What is your problem?

23:05.884 --> 23:09.911
Problem is you're touching
her, and she's a waitress.

23:09.988 --> 23:11.421
Tim, this is Randy.
He's one of my best customers.

23:11.490 --> 23:14.288
I don't care who he is. If he touches you
again, I'm gonna break both his arms.

23:14.359 --> 23:15.348
Tim, stop!

23:15.427 --> 23:16.689
I'd like to see you try.

23:16.895 --> 23:17.884
Let go of me.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.258

She's 17!

is your problem, man?

me, you take it out on me,

23:46.958 --> 23:47.982
She's gonna
lose her job.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.822
You were supposed to look
after her, weren't you?

23:50.061 --> 23:51.358
We had a deal.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.955
I screw up my life,

you're giving us. That's my answer.

two Dillon programs is facing elimination?

31:11.936 --> 31:13.494
So, it's a small committee.

For the most part they're smart,
pleasant, open-minded people.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.179
Hazel Hochman is
the Director of Admissions.

31:22.313 --> 31:25.805
He's essentially
humorless.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.883
He will be making the ultimate decision,
'cause you'll be working with him.

31:29.020 --> 31:32.421
So just focus all your positive
energy in his direction.

31:32.490 --> 31:34.287
Will do.
We're here. You ready?

31:34.359 --> 31:35.417
Oh.

Okay. I'm ready
as I'll ever be.

31:37.262 --> 31:38.286
Let's go.

31:40.098 --> 31:43.329
TAMI: Well, all I'm saying is, we
have found that our test scores

31:43.401 --> 31:47.701
are not at all representative
of the student bodies,

31:47.839 --> 31:51.104
and that they are just
increasingly inaccurate and so,

31:51.409 --> 31:55.368
you know, I have just
personally been trying to...

31:55.446 --> 31:58.574
Mrs. Taylor, are you saying then we
should ignore input like the SATs?

31:58.650 --> 32:00.379
No, no, no.
I'm not suggesting that we ignore it.

32:00.451 --> 32:01.577
Well, then what are you
suggesting?

32:01.853 --> 32:04.754
Well, I think you use them, but
I think you use them minimally.

32:04.822 --> 32:07.382
And I notice that you have
a very rigid cut-off point

32:07.458 --> 32:08.823
for your students' SAT scores.

32:08.893 --> 32:12.192
Mrs. Taylor, we have
approximately 18,000 applicants

32:12.263 --> 32:14.060
for 900 spots.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.597
I understand.
Now, we have to set cut-off points.

32:16.668 --> 32:20.365
With our limited resources, we can
properly assess the applicants.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.965
I'm just suggesting that you're not
getting the top-tier applicants.

32:24.042 --> 32:28.638
Dean, I think that Mrs. Taylor is just trying
to suggest we just sort of re-evaluate...

32:28.713 --> 32:30.647
Listen, I can only imagine
that y'all

32:30.782 --> 32:32.841
flew me all the way here
from Dillon, Texas,

32:32.917 --> 32:35.147
because you think I might know
something about high school students.

32:35.219 --> 32:37.244
I'm sure you do. And what I can
tell you is that I think there is

32:37.322 --> 32:41.486
a chasm happening and you are not
getting your best student here.

32:41.559 --> 32:43.891
Yes, that's because...
If you just broadened your admissions policies,

32:43.962 --> 32:46.590
you'd be in competition with
the Ivies if you wanted to be.

32:46.664 --> 32:48.029
I'm not interested in how
the Ivy League does things.

32:48.099 --> 32:49.088
TAMI: I retract it.

32:49.167 --> 32:52.227
But I'm just saying you're missing
such great kids out there.

32:52.303 --> 32:53.861
Now, as I understand it,

32:54.339 --> 32:58.503
you went from guidance counselor
to principal of your high school.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.468
And then back to
guidance counselor.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.104
Can you explain
that to us?

33:05.817 --> 33:08.615

but you don't have to do this.

33:09.687 --> 33:11.917

He sits up in bed at nights and he cries

33:20.431 --> 33:22.558
and there is nothing
I can do to stop him.

33:23.901 --> 33:26.392
He feels so bad
because he loves you so much.

33:26.471 --> 33:29.440
I love you so much because
of what you did for us.

It's a nice little gain for eight,
but the clock is still ticking.

35:04.368 --> 35:07.098
Howard steps back.
Looks like he sees something he likes.

35:07.338 --> 35:09.636
Oh, it's a big,
beautiful pass.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.669
Complete to Ruckle, but he's still inbounds.
The clock is winding, folks.

35:13.811 --> 35:14.835
They gotta go!

35:15.813 --> 35:17.542
Coach? Slot right, 90 double.

35:21.319 --> 35:22.308
Hut!

35:33.598 --> 35:36.658
Need to get to the end zone or the sideline,
it doesn't matter which one, all right?

35:38.669 --> 35:39.966
Ready, set...

35:41.706 --> 35:42.695
Hut!

35:54.785 --> 35:57.515
There you go, baby.
There you go, baby. There you go.

36:00.558 --> 36:01.616
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.454
VINCE: Just calm down. Calm.

36:04.729 --> 36:07.061
Tink, how you feeling?
Big as a mountain. Let's go.

36:07.131 --> 36:11.033
That's what I'm talking about. We're gonna go
26 power glide, all right? 26 power glide.

36:11.235 --> 36:13.169
On one. Ready?
ALL: Break!

36:13.971 --> 36:16.906
ANNOUNCER: Vince Howard brings the
East Dillon Lions to the line

36:16.974 --> 36:18.737
with two seconds in the game.

36:18.809 --> 36:22.802
One last shot with their entire
season on the line. Here we go.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.242
VINCE: Down, set!

36:25.750 --> 36:28.776
Red, blue, 28. Hut!

36:45.303 --> 36:46.634
(GRUNTING)

36:55.012 --> 36:57.776
Touchdown!
And the East Dillon Lions

36:57.848 --> 37:00.681
are going to the Texas High
School State Championship.

37:20.771 --> 37:22.204
(BANGING)

37:46.697 --> 37:47.891
(CRACKLING)

37:49.834 --> 37:52.359
MAN: The Lions are
heading to State!

38:00.011 --> 38:01.239
(SWITCHES OFF)

38:10.788 --> 38:12.153
DANA: You did
a great job today.

38:12.223 --> 38:13.417
It was fabulous.

38:13.557 --> 38:16.185
I don't think Dean Hochman
thought so, but...

38:16.360 --> 38:18.123
Dr. Tate. Hey. Hi.

38:18.262 --> 38:20.093
Hello. I'm sorry I'm late.
Oh, my goodness!

38:20.164 --> 38:22.860
I had dinner with a wealthy and
very angry alumnus, and...

38:23.000 --> 38:24.262
Oh, my goodness.
Well, hi.

38:24.368 --> 38:25.596
Nice to see you.

38:25.670 --> 38:27.001
Thank you, it's my pleasure.
I can't stay long.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.301
Oh, you're so sweet.
Thank you for even coming by.

38:29.373 --> 38:30.499
I offer my apologies
in advance.

38:30.574 --> 38:32.769
I have two kids at home
that need tucking in.

38:33.444 --> 38:34.672
Anyway, cheers.
DANA: Cheers.

38:34.745 --> 38:36.576
Cheers.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.205
And thank y'all
again so much.

38:38.282 --> 38:40.944
It was really a great, great
opportunity for me today.

38:41.018 --> 38:42.417
Okay.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.078
We're not offering you
assistant Dean of Admissions.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.213
I understand.

38:45.289 --> 38:47.348
You know, it wasn't something
I really expected,

38:47.425 --> 38:49.120
but it was such a great
thing for me...

38:49.193 --> 38:52.128
Because we're offering you
Dean of Admissions.

39:02.873 --> 39:04.238
What?
It's in there.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.606
But what about
Dean Hochman?

39:09.380 --> 39:13.817
I want people like you
at this college.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.219
Oh, my goodness. I am...

39:22.026 --> 39:24.586
I am...
I don't know what to say.

39:24.662 --> 39:27.893
I'm a counselor at a
small school in Texas.

39:27.965 --> 39:30.126
And principal of
a Blue Ribbon School.

39:30.267 --> 39:31.700
I don't know what to say.

39:32.236 --> 39:33.760
TATE: So,
this is what you say.

39:34.805 --> 39:37.399
Say, "I know this is a
tremendous opportunity,

39:37.475 --> 39:40.239
"but I need to go home
and talk to my husband."

39:40.845 --> 39:45.441
And hopefully then you're gonna
call me and you're gonna say yes.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.309
Thank you.

39:50.821 --> 39:51.947
I'm gonna leave.
DANA: Sorry you can't stay.

39:55.526 --> 39:56.993
DANA: So?

39:57.395 --> 39:58.453
Thank you.

39:58.529 --> 39:59.860
Thank you.
DANA: Night.

40:04.101 --> 40:05.261

40:05.403 --> 40:07.030
(PLAYERS CHATTERING) Bring it up.
Hey, hey, hey.

40:07.104 --> 40:08.264
Hey, listen up.
Listen up.

40:08.372 --> 40:10.431
Bring this board up.
Hey, fellas. Check this out.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.303
What's this say?
ALL: One!

40:12.443 --> 40:13.569
How many games to State?

40:13.778 --> 40:14.972
ALL: One!

40:15.045 --> 40:16.034
No, sir.

40:16.113 --> 40:17.808
Get rid of that.
What's it say now?

40:17.982 --> 40:19.176
ALL: State!
What's it say?

40:19.316 --> 40:20.442
ALL: State!

40:20.518 --> 40:21.780
Baby, we're going to State!

40:21.852 --> 40:23.217
(ALL CHEERING)

40:27.091 --> 40:28.149
Hey, Coach. Coach.

40:28.292 --> 40:29.725
We just missed the turn
for the field house.

40:29.894 --> 40:31.020
We're not going
to the field house.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.357
Where we going?

40:34.432 --> 40:35.763
