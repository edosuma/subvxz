00:08.975 --> 00:11.878
- Winnie, what are you doing? Leave Helen alone!

00:11.978 --> 00:13.980
- Get-- - Shit!

00:14.047 --> 00:17.250
- Get off her! Get off her, get off her!

00:17.350 --> 00:18.918
Get off of her!

00:19.019 --> 00:21.221
Jesus Christ! Now!

00:21.321 --> 00:22.756
Now!

00:26.926 --> 00:28.828
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:28.895 --> 00:31.064
Oh, my God, I'm going to die!

00:50.083 --> 00:52.118
- Oh, thank God.

00:52.218 --> 00:55.121
She's completely lost her mind, I mean--what are you doing?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.095
- All right. Everybody, back in the van.

01:02.195 --> 01:04.030
- Come on, come on. - Just step in.

01:04.097 --> 01:05.565
- Is there a minute I can--

01:05.632 --> 01:06.966
- Your energy is a little bit hostile.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.369
If you could just-- - Watch your head.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.938
- Heard it, like an animal... - So scary!

01:12.038 --> 01:13.273
- I hope Winnie's okay.

01:13.373 --> 01:14.808
- I'm pretty sure that she has the flu.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.209
- I'll have you step up in, please.

01:16.276 --> 01:17.577
- Hey! Don't push me! - Don't push him!

01:17.644 --> 01:19.479
- Don't push me!

01:19.579 --> 01:20.880
- All right. Is this all of you?

01:20.947 --> 01:22.215
- Yeah. - Yes, sir.

01:22.282 --> 01:23.383
- Where is your queen?

01:23.450 --> 01:25.618
- We don't know, officer.

01:25.718 --> 01:27.387
- Oh!

01:27.454 --> 01:30.657
- We got the crazy one detained in our car.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.325
They say she ate two old people,

01:32.425 --> 01:34.761
but we can't find any trace of the bodies anywhere.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.663
- I think they're all fucking nuts.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.498
- Well, let's head back to the city.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.000
Follow us.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.637
- Welcome aboard the Tunnel Access 99.

01:44.737 --> 01:46.639
The door is closing.

01:46.739 --> 01:48.975
Officer Brentline and Officer Sweetapple,

01:49.075 --> 01:51.644
it feels like you want to go to New York City

01:51.744 --> 01:55.014
Police precinct number 13. Did I get that right?

01:55.115 --> 01:57.750
- Yes. - Sorry, you need to speak up.

01:57.817 --> 02:00.153
Can you please repeat? - Yes!

02:00.253 --> 02:03.189
- Please, speak confidently, so we register your answer.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.692
- Yes! Jesus Christ!

02:05.792 --> 02:08.027
- Fucking beta-version bullshit.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.329
I heard everybody on the force

02:09.429 --> 02:10.697
who got one was bitching about it.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.699
- - Shut up back there!

02:21.508 --> 02:23.510
- I don't want to go to jail.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.112
- I think jail would be quite joyful.

02:26.179 --> 02:30.850
- But I just got reborn. I want to go out.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.887
- Elliott, where the hell are Dory and Drew?

02:33.987 --> 02:39.859
both:

02:44.697 --> 02:47.066
- Drew, I love your singing voice!

02:47.167 --> 02:49.502
- Thank you! I do, too!

02:49.569 --> 02:51.037
I've always wanted to pursue it.

02:51.137 --> 02:52.572
I goof around with it

02:52.672 --> 02:55.975
because I've been too afraid to, you know, lean in.

02:56.042 --> 02:57.810
- Well, once we give these pills to people

02:57.877 --> 03:00.013
and the world is finally at peace,

03:00.079 --> 03:02.482
you can spend the rest of your days singing!

03:02.549 --> 03:04.050
- That is so true!

03:04.150 --> 03:06.052
And you know why? - Why?

03:06.152 --> 03:08.922
- Because... both: â™ª This is the dawning

03:32.378 --> 03:36.349
What's wrong? - Do you want to explain this?

03:40.220 --> 03:43.056
- Are these birds evil?

03:43.122 --> 03:44.424
- Hello?

03:44.524 --> 03:46.092
- Okay. I'm sorry, Liquorice.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.094
Once again, I don't know why you're mad at me.

03:48.194 --> 03:51.864
- "Jack Hallwood feeds birds at the age of 93."

03:51.931 --> 03:56.135
Does that not alarm you at all? - Lower your voice.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.870
Sometimes it just takes me a second

03:57.937 --> 03:59.973
to catch up to your wisdom.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.310
- Jack Hallwood, son of Chantal Witherbottom and John Hallwood.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.545
What does this mean?

04:05.612 --> 04:07.413
It means you're a slut! - Okay.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.984
Okay, so you're saying that this 93-year-old man

04:11.084 --> 04:15.154
is my son with that child?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.624
- The point is you cheated on me!

04:17.724 --> 04:22.095
- No, I didn't, I swear. Not yet, at least.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.430
- But you will and this proves it!

04:24.497 --> 04:27.166
- Okay, you know what? I will not apologize

04:27.267 --> 04:29.102
for something I have not done.

04:29.168 --> 04:31.504
- Do you understand what I'm talking about here, Chantal?

04:31.604 --> 04:34.407
The end of the world is just one condom away.

04:34.474 --> 04:38.144
- Okay, I will wear a condom. Is that what you want to hear?

04:38.244 --> 04:42.115
- It's too late for that. Do you know what's coming?

04:42.181 --> 04:44.417
Cannibals! Flames!

04:44.484 --> 04:47.353
Total annihilation! Ah!

04:51.424 --> 04:55.528
You're faking it. - Ah!

04:55.628 --> 04:57.830
- Okay, I am not falling for it.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.466
If you think I'm calling an ambulance,

05:00.533 --> 05:02.135
you've got another thing coming.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.707
- Baloney.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.511
- You don't think it was

05:11.611 --> 05:14.280
the pill that made Winnie sick, do you?

05:14.347 --> 05:16.883
- What?

05:16.983 --> 05:20.453
No, El. That would be, like...

05:20.520 --> 05:22.555
an extreme reaction, wouldn't it?

05:22.655 --> 05:24.957
- Well, this is what happens when things go untested.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.893
- Oh!

05:26.993 --> 05:28.528
- What the hell was that?

05:28.628 --> 05:30.063
- Oh, my God. - Aah!

05:30.163 --> 05:31.397
- Officers, I think

05:31.497 --> 05:34.534
there's something wrong with the car.

05:34.634 --> 05:37.403
- Oh, something's loose and flapping around up there.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.639
- All right, all right. I'll pull over.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.376
- Hey, we've gotta pull over for a second

05:43.476 --> 05:45.511
to check some shit.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.480
- Copy. - Pull over.

05:47.547 --> 05:51.217
- A pullover is a garment worn on the top half of the body.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.019
Do you accept this definition?

05:53.086 --> 05:55.421
- I accept. Pull over the car.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.324
- Pulling over. - Thank you.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.837
- Oh, my God! - Oh!

06:12.872 --> 06:15.007
- Oh, my God...

06:16.042 --> 06:18.111
- What the hell?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.178
- Okay...

06:19.245 --> 06:20.580
- Ooh!

06:20.680 --> 06:22.782
- What's going on? - Mike!

06:22.882 --> 06:26.619
- Ow! Ow!

06:26.719 --> 06:27.954
- Ah!

06:29.622 --> 06:32.792
- I think there's, like, a hawk or a condor up there!

06:34.927 --> 06:36.562
- Oh, holy shit. What is that?

06:36.629 --> 06:38.965
- It's a lady?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.633
It's--it's a lady eating them!

06:50.576 --> 06:52.211
- Open door! - I'm sorry.

06:52.278 --> 06:54.313
Please speak with resolve. We didn't get that.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.815
- Open door! Open door!

06:55.915 --> 06:57.316
- Open door policy

06:57.417 --> 06:58.451
is a term used to refer

06:58.551 --> 06:59.619
to when a supervisor

06:59.719 --> 07:01.087
leaves their office door open

07:01.154 --> 07:02.555
in order to encourage transparency

07:02.622 --> 07:03.956
within the company's community.

07:04.056 --> 07:05.758
Do you accept this as a-- - No!

07:05.825 --> 07:07.427
No! Open the door!

07:07.493 --> 07:10.463
- You said, "Open door." -

07:10.563 --> 07:13.666
Oh. Ooh.

07:13.766 --> 07:14.801
- Oh!

07:16.969 --> 07:19.172
- Is that Helen?

07:22.508 --> 07:24.510
- Oh, good Lord! - Oh!

07:24.610 --> 07:26.078
- It's so freaky!

07:26.145 --> 07:27.647
- Kick the door open!

07:45.765 --> 07:47.934
- Go, go, go!

07:51.304 --> 07:52.505
- We're closed.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.373
It's all broken!

07:59.679 --> 08:01.547
- Open up that door!

08:01.647 --> 08:03.850
- Open this door! - Oh!

08:09.555 --> 08:11.491
- Go, go, go, go, go!

08:27.840 --> 08:30.476
- Dory, there's hundreds of people camped outside

08:30.543 --> 08:32.345
of Lyte Headquarters, like, grieving you.

08:32.411 --> 08:33.880
- What? - Look.

08:33.980 --> 08:38.084
all:

08:44.857 --> 08:47.393
- They still believe in the cause.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.762
- Then that's who should get it first.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.266
We go there, and we distribute what we have,

08:53.366 --> 08:56.269
and the whole world will change.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.670
- How's that grilled cheese, sugar?

08:57.737 --> 09:00.773
- Oh, my God. It is so, so good.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.343
Like, what did we do to deserve grilled cheese?

09:06.012 --> 09:09.849
- Okay. You sound like me.

09:09.916 --> 09:13.219
- It is scrumdiddly- dum-dumcious, though.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.257
- They're going to break the fucking glass!

09:18.357 --> 09:19.892
- They can't. It's bulletproof.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.228
- Why would it be bulletproof? - Because I'm mafia.

09:22.295 --> 09:26.299
Might as well say it.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.134
- What is going on? What is happening?

09:28.234 --> 09:29.468
Look at Helen!

09:29.569 --> 09:32.138
She looks sick just like Winnie.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.639
- Okay, okay, everyone. Okay, everyone.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.274
Don't be mad at me!

09:35.374 --> 09:38.244
But last night, I switched the enlightenment jelly beans

09:38.311 --> 09:40.379
for real jelly beans, and I think I accidentally left

09:40.446 --> 09:42.281
some of the enlightenment jelly beans in there,

09:42.381 --> 09:43.883
and that's what Winnie must have taken.

09:43.950 --> 09:47.086
- And it turned her into that thing?

09:47.153 --> 09:48.654
- I mean, unless she has a crazy period

09:48.754 --> 09:50.156
or something, I don't know.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.326
- Wait, so I'm not enlightened?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.328
- I mean, you could be, sweetie,

09:55.428 --> 09:57.163
but it's probably just from your own inner work.

09:57.263 --> 10:01.601
- Oh, my God! Marty, you're bleeding.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.103
- Oh, gosh.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.905
I guess I'll need a Band-Aid, right?

10:08.107 --> 10:10.977
- No! - Shit, shit, shit!

10:11.077 --> 10:13.112
We have to isolate him! - Why?

10:13.179 --> 10:14.814
- Marty, have you been paying attention?

10:14.914 --> 10:16.515
Because you've bitten,

10:16.616 --> 10:17.984
and you're gonna turn into a zombie.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.653
- Just get out! Can't you kill him?

10:20.753 --> 10:22.088
Aren't you mafia or something?

10:22.154 --> 10:23.689
- My role is more like the gossip.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.659
- Okay, a zombie? Okay, you guys sound insane.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.161
That's so clearly not what's happening right now.

10:29.261 --> 10:31.831
Like, I've seen this all the time at music festivals.

10:31.931 --> 10:35.001
They're just dehydrated.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.941
- Oh, my God!

10:42.008 --> 10:43.142
- You're gonna clean that up.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.320
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

10:54.387 --> 10:56.889
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

10:58.691 --> 11:02.161
- Hey, everyone. In here, serious, quiet!

11:03.729 --> 11:05.131
- 911, what's your emergency?

11:05.197 --> 11:06.799
- Zombies. - Oh, my God.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.567
- Excuse me, did you for real just say zombies?

11:08.668 --> 11:09.869
- Uh-huh.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.838
- What happened to Elodie and Leonora?

11:20.579 --> 11:24.016
- What was that?

11:29.422 --> 11:32.224
He's in here.

11:32.324 --> 11:35.494
- The police will be here any minute.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.930
It's going to be okay. We'll be saved.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.733
- I'm really glad I didn't get emotionally attached to anyone

11:40.833 --> 11:43.936
who has thus far turned into a zombie.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.438
- Oh, my God. - What?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.440
- I just realized something that's actually

11:47.540 --> 11:50.176
kind of really very bad. - What?

11:50.242 --> 11:54.080
- So Winnie ate the jelly bean and turned into a zombie.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.414
- Yeah.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.450
- Dory has the rest of the jelly beans.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.784
- Yeah?

11:58.884 --> 12:00.252
- Didn't she say she was gonna pass them out

12:00.352 --> 12:02.288
to as many people as she possibly could?

12:02.388 --> 12:03.956
- Oh, God.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.058
- That would be, like, really bad, right?

12:06.125 --> 12:08.427
- What if that's what Drew and Dory are doing right now?

12:08.527 --> 12:10.296
- We have to do something. - But I don't want to.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.032
- I don't want to either, but I think that this thing is,

12:13.099 --> 12:15.801
like, actually spreading really fucking fast.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.303
- She's right.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.905
The R-Naught on this thing is disastrous,

12:19.972 --> 12:21.774
and I don't want to do the math,

12:21.874 --> 12:23.409
but the aggressive nature of this

12:23.476 --> 12:27.480
is likely to significantly reduce the population.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.782
- Oh, God.

12:29.882 --> 12:32.952
- We have to stop it.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.954
- You're right. - Are y'all psycho?

12:35.054 --> 12:36.655
You can do whatever you want,

12:36.756 --> 12:38.958
but I'm going to stay right here

12:39.058 --> 12:44.830
until the authorities come and fix everything.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.899
- I'll come with you.

12:46.966 --> 12:51.637
I feel really bad that I created this formula.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.414
- Follow me.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.995
Go back in. Go back, go back,

13:16.095 --> 13:17.363
go back, go back.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.676
- We'll go in the go-karts and ride those back to Brooklyn.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.211
The only problem is that the go-karts

13:32.311 --> 13:33.712
are on the other side of this place.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.881
- Okay, okay. - You ready? You ready?

13:35.981 --> 13:37.383
- We've got this. Yes. Yes.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.386
- You people are nuts. There are literal zombies.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.990
Let the people with the proper training handle the situation.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.725
You're going to get yourselves killed.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.662
- Shh! Pepper, stop.

13:52.531 --> 13:55.134
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

14:01.073 --> 14:03.475
- Go.

14:17.489 --> 14:21.327
- I want to get out of here.

14:21.393 --> 14:24.930
- I think they're gone.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.499
I'll check. - Be careful.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.083
- Yeah, okay, let's go. Get up.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.865
- Okay.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.468
They're going to be here any second now.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.936
No need to be scared.

15:27.459 --> 15:28.928
- This can't be the right way.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.597
- Why would there be an exit in the laser tag?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.799
- Okay, I squatted in the laser tag for a week

15:33.899 --> 15:35.634
shortly after coming out, just trust me.

15:35.734 --> 15:39.138
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Portia, shh.

15:39.238 --> 15:42.975
- There's a zombie in here. - Shh right now, shh.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.444
- Be quiet, Portia.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.916
- - What?

15:50.983 --> 15:52.618
- It's okay. It's nothing, it's nothing.

15:52.685 --> 15:57.856
- Oh, my God. - It's nothing, just...

15:57.957 --> 16:02.461
Okay. Okay, okay.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.366
Okay, there's an exit.

16:11.670 --> 16:15.341
- Oh, my God, oh, my God! -

16:15.441 --> 16:16.709
Oh, no!

16:16.809 --> 16:19.511
- Get off of my fucking friend!

16:21.513 --> 16:22.781
- Oh, my God! - Get the--

16:22.848 --> 16:24.049
- Shit! - Close the door!

16:26.952 --> 16:29.021
Go, get it, go! - They're coming!

16:29.121 --> 16:31.223
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe!

16:31.323 --> 16:34.560
- Oh, no. Oh, my God, no!

16:34.660 --> 16:36.562
- Come on! Drive!

16:36.662 --> 16:38.330
Oh, my God, make it go! Make it go!

16:38.397 --> 16:39.665
- I don't know how! I don't know how!

16:39.732 --> 16:42.034
- No! No! No! No!

16:42.134 --> 16:43.736
- Oh, my God! - Push the gas!

16:44.837 --> 16:46.638
- Make it go, God damn it!

16:48.173 --> 16:49.575
- No! Please!

16:49.675 --> 16:51.477
Please! Close doors!

16:51.543 --> 16:52.845
Close doors!

16:52.911 --> 16:55.814
- Please speak with a kinder tone.

16:55.881 --> 16:59.318
- Close doors, please!

17:01.220 --> 17:03.155
- We're going to die! - Okay, I got it!

17:03.222 --> 17:05.190
- - Whoo-hoo!

17:05.257 --> 17:07.893
- Oh, my God, go! Go!

17:07.993 --> 17:10.696
- Come on, come on, come on!

17:10.763 --> 17:13.031
- Oh, no! It still doesn't go!

17:13.098 --> 17:14.833
- Come on!

17:17.770 --> 17:21.106
- Oh, my God! Go faster!

17:21.206 --> 17:23.942
- Oh, my God! Whoo!

17:24.042 --> 17:26.278
- The midtown women's morgue in Manhattan

17:26.378 --> 17:28.213
has been quarantined this morning

17:28.280 --> 17:30.616
due to an unnamed contagious outbreak.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.352
The building has been sealed, and the block evacuated

17:33.419 --> 17:36.088
as authorities attempt to contain the spread.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.023
Details about the disease are being withheld,

17:38.090 --> 17:39.691
for the time being,

17:39.758 --> 17:42.194
so please make sure to stay clear of that area.

17:42.261 --> 17:45.064
- Oh, no, scary. - Yeah.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.432
It'll be fine.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.267
It seems like they have it under control.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.536
- Yeah. Thank you. - You're welcome.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.605
- This was incredible. -

17:56.575 --> 17:59.545
- Hi, are you Mrs. Liquorice Montague?

17:59.611 --> 18:05.984
- I am, yeah. - Hi. I'm Dr. Amanda Baby.

18:06.085 --> 18:10.622
I'm so sorry, but your wife...she passed.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.960
Mm...

18:15.060 --> 18:16.662
- What was wrong with her?

18:16.762 --> 18:20.599
- Well, she just kind of had every awful thing you can have:

18:20.666 --> 18:25.471
scabies, mites, tapeworms, heartworms, hookworms,

18:25.571 --> 18:29.308
roundworms, fleas, ticks, bedbugs, body lice.

18:29.408 --> 18:32.978
They just kind of ate away at her from all sides,

18:33.078 --> 18:37.149
and then, of course, they ate each other.

18:37.249 --> 18:40.252
- But that's not possible.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.754
We shower with iron pellets. - Mm.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.189
I'm going to write you a prescription

18:44.289 --> 18:46.358
for an antibiotic because there is no way

18:46.458 --> 18:49.194
you haven't been exposed to something.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.864
And can you please not sit on any of the other chairs?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.533
We'll have to burn that one.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.870
Oh, before she choked on her last breath,

18:57.970 --> 18:59.972
she asked me to give you this.

19:00.038 --> 19:03.175
I want to say she said it was a letter from the future.

19:03.275 --> 19:05.344
- Are you from the future?

19:05.444 --> 19:07.379
- Am I from the future?

19:07.479 --> 19:11.016
No, sweetie. I'm from right now.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.719
You can pay up front.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.138
- Okay, Drew and Dory are probably headed

19:33.205 --> 19:34.740
to Lyte Headquarters. Put it in!

19:34.840 --> 19:36.508
- Are we even going to be able to make it that far?

19:36.575 --> 19:39.978
- Honestly, I do not know how this thing is still going!

19:47.686 --> 19:49.521
- Oh, my God. Look!

19:49.588 --> 19:51.423
- Wow. - Aw, how beautiful.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.692
- My God.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.898
Hey!

19:59.998 --> 20:02.734
- It's her, it's her!

20:02.834 --> 20:06.438
She has risen! She has risen!

20:10.108 --> 20:13.212
- I'm alive! I'm alive!

20:15.414 --> 20:19.251
- Let her speak! Let her speak!

20:19.351 --> 20:22.421
- Today is a good day!

20:25.057 --> 20:27.593
Because today is the day

20:27.693 --> 20:31.430
that humanity's true nature is revealed.

20:34.266 --> 20:37.803
- I bring you the pills.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.945
Are you ready?

20:47.045 --> 20:49.715
I said, are you ready?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.319
- Oh, God!

20:54.419 --> 20:56.822
Oh, come on! - Shit!

20:56.922 --> 20:57.956
- Come on!

20:58.056 --> 21:01.093
- Shit! - Oh!

21:01.159 --> 21:02.394
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

21:02.461 --> 21:04.630
Oh, my God! Babe, it's Dory!

21:04.730 --> 21:05.998
- Perfect timing. - Oh, my God!

21:06.098 --> 21:07.666
She has the beans! She has the beans!

21:07.766 --> 21:08.900
- Oh, my God, we have to get out and stop her right now!

21:08.967 --> 21:10.669
- Dory! - Dory!

21:14.640 --> 21:17.075
- Yeah! - Open your hands!

21:17.142 --> 21:21.280
Open your mouths, and open your hearts!

21:28.687 --> 21:30.756
- Dory! - Stop!

21:30.822 --> 21:32.424
- Stop!

21:40.165 --> 21:42.968
- Dory, stop! - Dory!
