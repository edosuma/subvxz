WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:04.712
Wait a minute.
You're telling me this actress person...

00:04.879 --> 00:07.881
...is the only woman you ever wanted
who didn't want you back?

00:08.048 --> 00:09.508
Yeah.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.260
Oh, my God.

00:11.594 --> 00:13.929
Is this what it's like to be you?

00:15.223 --> 00:18.267
- Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
- Oh. You have no idea.

00:18.435 --> 00:22.479
And when we're on-stage,
I get to kiss her and touch her.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.440
But then she goes home
with the director...

00:24.607 --> 00:26.483
...and it's like somebody's
ripping out my heart.

00:26.651 --> 00:30.362
Oh, it's so great to see you
feeling like this.

00:32.281 --> 00:33.907
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.285
Monica, uh, Dad called this morning...

00:36.453 --> 00:40.330
...and, uh, Aunt Sylvia passed away.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.334
Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.840
We were all pretty shaken up about it.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.467
Wait, am I missing something?

00:51.634 --> 00:54.386
Because I always thought death
was supposed to be sad, in a way.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.556
Well, uh, Aunt Sylvia was...

00:57.724 --> 00:59.141
...well, not a nice person.

00:59.309 --> 01:03.312
No, she was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.647
And I'm sorry she died.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.567
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

01:08.735 --> 01:11.945
- You get the dollhouse.
- I get the dollhouse.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.909
Wow. A house for dolls. That is so cool.

01:17.869 --> 01:20.204
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.499
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel
for a dollhouse?

01:24.209 --> 01:26.085
No, just a barrel.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.379
You know what?
You can play with my dollhouse.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.840
- Really? Really?
- Any time you want.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.219
When I was younger, all I wanted to do
was to play with this dollhouse.

01:35.386 --> 01:38.764
But no. It was to be looked at,
but never played with.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.391
My grandmother used to say
that exact same thing to me.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.028
- Hey, Sophie.
- Hey, Rach.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.238
Hey.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.824
Thanks for lunch, Chandler.
You didn't have to walk me here.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.910
Oh, that's okay. No problem.

02:44.664 --> 02:48.167
Honey, you do realize we don't keep
the women's lingerie here in the office.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.713
Yes, I realize that.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.883
- Summer catalog.
- That's the stuff.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.469
Rachel, I need the Versace invoice.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.389
Hello. You don't work for me.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.642
Joanna, this is my friend
Chandler Bing. Joanna.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.519
Bing? Heh. That's a great name.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.439
Thanks, it's Gaelic for,
"Thy turkey's done."

03:13.735 --> 03:16.153
- So, uh, I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you.
- You too.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.863
Bye, Chandler.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.117
So, uh, what's wrong with him?

03:22.285 --> 03:26.914
Oh, nothing. He's just goofy like that.
I actually hardly notice it anymore.

03:28.041 --> 03:32.461
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, is he, um, married
or involved with anyone?

03:32.629 --> 03:36.798
No, no. He's not married or involved
with anyone.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.885
Oh, Rachel...

03:40.053 --> 03:41.929
Actually, you know what? Forget it.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.557
- I'll ask him for you if you want me to.
- Would you?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.351
Or is it just too sad and desperate...

03:47.518 --> 03:49.603
...you know,
something that Sophie would do?

03:49.771 --> 03:52.105
- I am here.
- I know that.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.777
Look at it.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.237
Oh.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.781
Wallpaper's a little faded.
That's okay.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.324
Carpet's a little loose.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.992
Hardwood floors?

04:06.204 --> 04:08.664
- Hey. Oh!
- Hello.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.332
Oh, Monica.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.835
- It's so beautiful.
- I know.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.630
- So I'm here, ready to play. Hee-hee.
- Okay.

04:17.798 --> 04:22.261
I brought a bunch of stuff
for the house, so check it out. Ha, ha.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.057
What's this?

04:27.225 --> 04:29.559
That's a dog.
Every house should have a dog.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.020
Not one that can pee on the roof.

04:33.481 --> 04:39.403
Well, maybe it's so big because the house
was built on radioactive waste.

04:41.447 --> 04:45.033
And is this in case the house sneezes?

04:46.619 --> 04:50.122
No. No, that's the ghost for the attic.

04:51.249 --> 04:55.043
- I don't want a ghost.
- Well, nobody wants a ghost.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.879
But you've got one...

04:58.047 --> 05:02.342
...because the house is sitting on
an ancient Indian burial ground.

05:04.053 --> 05:07.264
Wait a minute. The house
was built on radioactive waste...

05:07.432 --> 05:10.058
...and an ancient Indian burial ground?

05:10.226 --> 05:12.394
Ha, ha. That would never happen.

05:14.063 --> 05:17.899
Okay, obviously you don't know much
about the U.S. Government. Ha, ha.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.403
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.573
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure. What's up?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.242
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.203
Heh. I know.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.916
Well, if something comes up...

05:38.171 --> 05:41.757
Well, I'm glad you guys are past
that little awkward phase.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.511
Okay. My boss, Joanna. When you left...

05:46.679 --> 05:48.597
...she started asking questions
about you.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.016
Ha, ha. Liked what she saw, huh?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.437
Dug my action, did she?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.690
Checking out the Chan Chan Man.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.904
That was...

06:04.072 --> 06:06.114
...surreal.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.450
Okay, what do you think?
You interested at all?

06:08.951 --> 06:13.080
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive.
I'll do it.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.833
Oh, thank you, Chandler.
This is great. She's gonna love me.

06:17.001 --> 06:21.088
Okay, dinosaur attack.
Quick, everybody into the house. Aah!

06:22.673 --> 06:26.301
All right, Phoebe, you know what?
That's it. That's it. All right?

06:26.469 --> 06:29.763
No dinosaurs, no ghosts,
no giant dogs, okay?

06:29.931 --> 06:33.767
They're not the right size, they're
not Victorian, and they just don't go.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.395
Okay.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.188
Fine.

06:38.898 --> 06:43.110
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome
in the house of no imagination.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.821
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering
around the subject...

06:45.988 --> 06:51.076
...I just have to say that dinosaurs,
they don't go, "Ruff."

06:52.578 --> 06:54.621
The little ones do.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.423
- Hey, Kate.
- Morning.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.092
Listen, I, uh, went to that restaurant
you talked about...

07:07.260 --> 07:08.635
Hey, lovely.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.012
Come, talk to me for a minute.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.932
And I ate the food. It was good.
I had the fish.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.059
Yeah, it was pretty good. Yeah.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.686
Hi.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.604
I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.690
Oh. Hey. Joey Tribbiani.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.526
I know. I'm a big fan of yours.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.778
What?

07:28.281 --> 07:31.867
I used to, um, schedule my classes
so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...

07:32.034 --> 07:33.743
...on Days of our Lives.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.245
Get out of here. Really?

07:35.413 --> 07:36.746
- Absolutely.
- Huh.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.125
Oh, but then they went and dropped you
down that elevator shaft.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.043
Yeah, they gave me the shaft, all right.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.839
You're so funny.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.133
Listen, um, what are you doing
after rehearsal?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.677
Do you wanna get a drink or something?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.512
Well, uh...

07:56.058 --> 07:58.894
Yeah. Yeah, sure. A drink sounds great.

07:59.061 --> 08:02.397
- Cool. I'll see you then.
- Okay. All right.

08:05.735 --> 08:10.071
All right. It's time to act,
my talking props.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.453
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.788
Look, everybody.
Look at my new dollhouse.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.415
Wow.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.004
Ha, ha. Look, look.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.926
Hey, what's this?

08:31.093 --> 08:34.054
Oh, okay. It's a slide instead of stairs.
Look.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.263
Oh!

08:36.557 --> 08:37.933
Very interesting, Phoebe.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.894
What's this?

08:41.062 --> 08:44.439
The licorice room.
You can eat all the furniture.

08:46.234 --> 08:50.445
And when guests come over, they can
stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.032
This is the coolest house ever.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.161
Hey. Does anyone want to join me
in the Aroma Room?

08:58.329 --> 09:00.664
- All right.
- I would.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.499
Hey, guys? Guys.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.876
Did you see my new china cabinet?

09:05.294 --> 09:06.336
Uh-huh.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.297
Watch. Watch.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.801
- Ooh.
- And? And?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.933
Hey, my father's house does that.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.937
Okay, how did it go?
Tell me everything.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.480
Well, the movie was great...

09:25.648 --> 09:30.277
...dinner was great, and there's nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening.

09:30.444 --> 09:34.489
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that
because Joanna's such a big dull dud.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.660
Chandler is fantastic.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.830
- What?
- Oh, God. You know how people just click?

09:41.998 --> 09:46.293
Like, he came by to pick me up. I opened
the door, and it was just like, "click."

09:46.460 --> 09:47.961
- Did he tell you?
- Well...

09:48.170 --> 09:50.922
Oh, and he's got such a good heart.
Doesn't he have a good heart?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.674
Oh, I know. And he's so sweet.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.010
He said he'd call,
so put him straight through.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.263
- Isn't this great?
- Don't spoil it.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.809
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?

10:02.977 --> 10:04.352
What do you say?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.480
Hello? Oh!

10:07.648 --> 10:10.817
It's you. Just, uh... Just one sec.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.653
I am going to take this call.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.116
When I continue,
I hope that there will appear on-stage...

10:18.284 --> 10:22.746
...this magical thing
that in the theater we call...

10:22.913 --> 10:25.957
...committing to the moment.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.505
The guy's like a cartoon.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.216
What do you see in him, anyway?

10:35.384 --> 10:37.218
He happens to be brilliant.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.221
Which is more than I can say
for that sweater you're dating.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.225
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.645
It's what's underneath her sweater
that counts.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.733
And besides, since, uh...

10:51.901 --> 10:53.735
Since when do you care
who I'm going out with?

10:53.903 --> 10:56.905
I don't care.
Why? Do you want me to care?

10:57.073 --> 11:00.408
Heh. Do you want me
to want you to care?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.661
Do you?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.329
What?

11:04.497 --> 11:09.209
Okay. I'm afraid to say this,
but let's pick it up where we left off.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.928
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?

11:20.096 --> 11:22.639
I've got no reason to stay.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.476
Stop.

11:26.644 --> 11:30.271
Stop it. You must stop.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.984
You are bad actors.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.612
This is a terrible play.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.989
I'll see you in the morning.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.620
I can't believe we go on in a week.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.957
- Hey, it's gonna be all right.
- Hey.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.419
So since we're getting off early,
do you want to go and paint mugs?

11:55.423 --> 11:56.798
What?

11:56.966 --> 11:59.592
You know, at that place I told you about
last night?

12:01.137 --> 12:03.972
Oh, yeah, with the mug-painting. Yeah.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.766
- I was so listening to that.
- Ha, ha.

12:07.476 --> 12:10.478
But, uh, you know what?
I think I need to work on my stuff tonight.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.480
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.274
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.780
- Okay. Ha, ha.
- Night.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.246
Uh, are you okay?

12:28.456 --> 12:29.956
Yeah, I guess.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.002
Like, what are we gonna do
about the scene, huh?

12:34.170 --> 12:35.503
I don't know.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.047
Well, um...

12:39.717 --> 12:42.010
Maybe if it had more heat.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.345
Well, how do you mean?

12:44.513 --> 12:48.391
Well, Adrianne's looking for a reason
to stay, right?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.686
Victor can't just kiss her. He's gotta...

12:51.854 --> 12:54.230
He's gotta really give her a reason,
you know?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.233
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.949
Or maybe...

13:05.117 --> 13:09.037
Maybe he could grab her and lift her up.

13:09.205 --> 13:12.874
Yeah, yeah. Then Adrianne, maybe
she could wrap her legs around his waist.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.295
And then she could rip off his shirt
and kiss his chest and his stomach.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.633
And then he could use his teeth, his teeth,
to undo her dress and...

13:21.842 --> 13:23.551
And bite her.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.554
And then right when the scene ends,
he could take her...

13:26.722 --> 13:30.266
...with this raw, animal...

13:35.022 --> 13:37.023
Something like that?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.150
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I had in mind.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.860
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.001
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.717
It's a little early to be drinking.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.264
Things, uh, finally happened with Kate.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.808
- Oh. That's great.
- You're kidding. That's great.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.643
Oh, it was so amazing.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.062
After the lovemaking...

14:16.230 --> 14:17.480
Oh, my.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.860
- I just watched her sleep for, like, hours.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.945
- Just breathing in...
- Huh.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.947
...and breathing out.

14:26.615 --> 14:30.785
And I knew she was dreaming
because her eyes kept going like this:

14:37.084 --> 14:39.252
I'm telling you,
Joanna's got it all wrong, okay?

14:39.420 --> 14:42.922
All I said was, "This was fun.
Let's do it again sometime.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.424
I'll give you a call."

14:44.592 --> 14:46.134
Oh, gee...

14:46.302 --> 14:49.220
I wonder why she thinks
you're going to call her?

14:49.972 --> 14:51.890
That's what you say at the end of a date.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.893
You can't just say,
"Nice to meet you. Good night"?

14:55.352 --> 14:56.728
To her face?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.648
It's the end of the date,
I'm standing there...

15:00.816 --> 15:02.984
...she's waiting for me to say
I'll call her...

15:03.152 --> 15:05.528
...and it just, you know, comes out.
I can't help it.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.738
It's a compulsion.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.575
Come on, Rach,
when a guy says he's gonna call...

15:10.743 --> 15:13.244
...it doesn't mean he's going to call.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.538
This never happened to you?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.707
Well, they always called.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.418
Bite me.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.010
- Did he call?
- No, sorry.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.388
Why? Why? He said he'd call.
Why hasn't he called?

15:32.556 --> 15:36.643
Maybe he's intimidated by really smart,
strong, successful women.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.854
Sophie, will you please
climb out of my butt.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.525
- Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
- Okay, okay.

15:44.693 --> 15:49.656
Um, well, uh, maybe he feels awkward
because you are my boss.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.492
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?

15:52.660 --> 15:54.535
The only person that should
feel awkward is you.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.204
You didn't tell him not to call me?

15:56.372 --> 15:59.207
If you're uncomfortable with your friend
dating someone you work for...

15:59.375 --> 16:01.584
...there are always ways to fix that.

16:02.711 --> 16:03.753
Uh...

16:05.005 --> 16:07.507
Call her. Call her now.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.135
Multiple, so many paper cuts.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.222
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why? Why?

16:14.390 --> 16:16.307
I don't understand. He said he'd call."

16:16.517 --> 16:19.894
Chandler, I'm telling you, she's flipped out.
She's gone crazy.

16:20.229 --> 16:23.356
Oh. Well, give me the phone, then.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.234
This isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault
you haven't called her.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.402
You have to call her.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.363
Look, you can't call somebody
after this long just to say:

16:30.531 --> 16:33.700
"In case you didn't notice,
I don't like you."

16:33.867 --> 16:35.868
Then you're gonna have to
take her out again.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.955
No. She's really dull,
and she gets this...

16:39.123 --> 16:43.209
...gross mascara-goop thing
in the corner of her eye.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.878
I don't care. I don't care.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.922
You'll take her out again and end it...

16:48.090 --> 16:50.591
...and end it in a way
that she knows it's actually ended.

16:50.759 --> 16:54.554
And I don't care how hard it is for you.
Do not tell her you'll call her again.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.055
All right, fine.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.350
But it's just a lunch date.
From now on, I get my own dates.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.728
I don't want you setting me up
with anybody again.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.479
That's fine.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.858
- That's just a lot of big talk, you know.
- I know.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.862
Mon?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.739
I'm in the shower.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.296
Aah! Fire. There's a fire. Fire.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.036
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:01.330 --> 18:06.709
So I, uh, talked to Lauren.
I kind of told her how things were with us.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.586
Did you, uh...? Did you talk to Marshall?

18:09.671 --> 18:10.755
About what?

18:10.923 --> 18:14.425
Ha, ha. You know,
about what happened with us.

18:15.552 --> 18:16.761
No.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.472
And there's really no reason
why he should find out.

18:19.640 --> 18:23.518
So, uh, let's not make a big deal
out of it, okay?

18:25.479 --> 18:27.313
What are you talking about?

18:27.564 --> 18:29.774
It was a big deal.

18:30.192 --> 18:34.195
I mean, come on, you can't tell me
last night didn't mean something to you.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.614
I was there.
You're not that good an actress.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.907
Look.

18:38.784 --> 18:42.328
Um, I was...
I was just caught up in the moment.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.081
That's all it was.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.960
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad...

18:49.128 --> 18:52.964
...but haven't you ever slept with a woman
where it meant more to her than to you?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.632
No.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.803
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi, Lauren.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.222
Hi, Lauren.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.057
Hi, pig.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.438
Sorry I, uh... I scared you in there.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.232
Oh, that's okay.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.317
By the way...

19:13.485 --> 19:16.612
...I was just checking
the shower massager.

19:16.780 --> 19:17.947
Yeah.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.033
Hey.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.119
I tried to reach you at work.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.538
There's been a fire.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.624
What? Oh, my... Oh, my God.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.210
What happened?

19:31.378 --> 19:34.881
Well, we believe it originated here...

19:35.966 --> 19:38.050
...in the Aroma Room.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.720
All right, did everyone get out okay?

19:40.888 --> 19:44.557
Well, the giraffe's okay
and so is the pirate.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.559
- What is this?
- No, Phoebe, don't look.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.769
You don't want to see
what's under there.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.733
The foster puppets.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.030
It's not a big deal.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.700
It's just... It's right here,
and it's all the time.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.872
Well, thanks again for lunch.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.420
- Yes, this was pleasant.
- It was, wasn't it?

20:15.380 --> 20:18.507
- The food there was great.
- Wasn't it?

20:20.761 --> 20:22.511
So take care.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.639
You too.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.226
This was great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.145
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.941
- Rachel, any messages?
- Sophie's desk.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.946
Chandler. Are you gonna call her?

20:40.113 --> 20:41.822
- No.
- Chandler.

20:41.990 --> 20:45.576
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm weak and pathetic and sorry.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.120
Okay, you are gonna tell her.
You're gonna tell her now.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.498
Ow, I'm not gonna call you.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.585
What?

20:55.337 --> 20:57.296
I'm sorry.

20:57.506 --> 21:01.300
I'm sorry that I said I was going to
when I'm not.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.303
Ugh. Look, this has nothing
to do with you.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.931
And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.351
I have serious, serious problems
when it comes to women.

21:10.519 --> 21:15.189
I have issues with commitment,
intimacy...

21:16.191 --> 21:17.692
...mascara goop.

21:20.737 --> 21:25.283
And I'm really sorry. It's just that
this is not... This isn't gonna work out.

21:27.661 --> 21:31.706
Well, this isn't how I was hoping
this would end...

21:31.873 --> 21:35.209
...but I guess I have to appreciate
your honesty.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.628
Yeah, okay.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.381
So...

21:43.385 --> 21:46.304
Well, this is great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again sometime.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.979
Wha... So anyway, Beth,
what I'm saying is...

21:55.147 --> 21:59.525
...I should have considered your feelings
before I went home with you that night.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.235
I've, uh...

22:01.820 --> 22:04.405
I've recently learned what it's like
to be on your side of it...

22:04.573 --> 22:06.741
...and I'm sorry.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.536
So do you think you can forgive me?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.748
Great. Thanks.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.083
Okay. Bye.

22:17.669 --> 22:18.753
Whoo.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.676
Hello, Jennifer?

22:25.844 --> 22:28.596
Oh, hi, Mrs. Laurio. Is Jennifer there?

22:28.764 --> 22:30.723
Oh, she's not home, huh?

22:31.308 --> 22:35.811
Well, uh, actually I kind of need
to talk to you too.
