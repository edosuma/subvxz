00:28.162 --> 00:30.464
<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

00:30.464 --> 00:32.133
<i>I took the fall
for you</i>

00:32.133 --> 00:33.567
because you was gonna be somebody.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.769
Okay, come on--
<i>Finish your beer,</i>

00:34.769 --> 00:36.303
then drop me off
at the treatment facility.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.671
<i>Don't bother visiting!</i>

00:37.671 --> 00:38.806
Russian motherfuckers.
They got a drug shipment

00:39.039 --> 00:40.141
coming in tomorrow.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.342
You could take credit
for the bust.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.610
<i>It'd get you back up
in the polls.</i>

00:42.610 --> 00:44.078
<i>This significant
victory is due</i>

00:44.078 --> 00:46.480
to the hard work
of my brothers and sisters

00:46.480 --> 00:48.182
in arms in the NYPD.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.550
I just want to say thank you
for what you did.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.684
<i>What did I do?
Saved us all</i>

00:50.684 --> 00:52.353
<i>when you took out Lauren.</i>

00:52.353 --> 00:53.788
I'm sorry
I didn't make it last night.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.122
- I--
- I don't care!

00:55.122 --> 00:56.390
I'm moving to OKC,

00:56.390 --> 00:58.526
and I don't want any
of this drama following me.

00:58.526 --> 00:59.660
<i>You think Weston Holdings</i>

00:59.660 --> 01:01.195
<i>is a giant Ponzi scheme.</i>

01:01.195 --> 01:02.463
You're right.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.664
You guys are fucking criminals!

01:03.664 --> 01:04.832
Wow.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.168
When he and Tariq
are running a drug operation

01:07.168 --> 01:08.369
under my roof.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.703
We've known
since the beginning.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.305
So keep
your fucking mouth shut.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.540
<i>The packaging
for the drugs</i>

01:12.540 --> 01:13.641
<i>that you found
at Weston Holdings</i>

01:13.641 --> 01:14.842
is a match
for the drugs we found

01:15.075 --> 01:16.444
<i>on the Stansfield rooftop</i>

01:16.444 --> 01:18.646
<i>and the Jamaica Avenue Boys
crime scene.</i>

01:18.646 --> 01:19.680
Sounds like a RICO to me.

01:21.348 --> 01:22.850
I trusted you.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.153
Dru, what the fuck?

01:26.153 --> 01:27.321
He killed Papi.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.558
Police! Hands on the table.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.359
Diana Tejada,
you are under arrest

01:32.359 --> 01:34.295
<i>for possession
of an illegal narcotic</i>

01:34.295 --> 01:36.130
- with intent to distribute.
- Ma.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.431
I'm coming to get you, baby.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.666
<i>The Feds
are building a RICO case</i>

01:38.666 --> 01:40.201
against you and the Tejadas.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.635
A RICO?
How did Saxe not see

01:41.635 --> 01:42.736
this shit coming?

01:42.736 --> 01:43.737
He did.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.206
I'm working with you

01:45.206 --> 01:46.373
because it's the best way
to bring

01:46.373 --> 01:48.242
these motherfuckers down,
but you lie to me,

01:48.242 --> 01:49.610
I won't hesitate to burn you.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.345
Saxe is working with the Feds.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.447
Saxe is a fucking mole.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.760
Don't be coming over here

03:49.930 --> 03:52.366
28 years, Cooper!

03:52.366 --> 03:56.637
28 years, I've been waiting
for my brother to get out.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.606
And now?

03:58.606 --> 04:01.442

Life is a motherfucker.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.312
Mm-hmm.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.580
Now come here.
Come on, come on--

04:06.580 --> 04:07.815
No, I don't wanna do this.

04:07.815 --> 04:11.352
No, no, no.
Come on, come on, come on.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.621
All right, to, uh...

04:13.621 --> 04:15.923
to trying to do the right thing

04:15.923 --> 04:17.558
but gettin' fuck all for it.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.592
Damn right.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.534
Okay.

04:27.534 --> 04:28.569
Wow, that's impressive.

04:32.640 --> 04:37.277
You know,
behind all that hair gel,

04:37.277 --> 04:40.014
you're a half decent motherfucker.

04:41.015 --> 04:43.784
Oh, oh, shit.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.918
I gotta take this.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.387
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.958
MacLean.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.426
<i>What?</i>

04:55.729 --> 04:58.499
I had no idea.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.067
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

05:02.436 --> 05:04.405
Hurry up!
I ain't raise no snitch,

05:04.405 --> 05:05.839
but they gonna lean
on her hard.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.475
<i>I'm on it.</i>
All right.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.543
Fuck.
If it was two,

05:09.543 --> 05:10.844
I wouldn't
be so fucking worried.

05:10.844 --> 05:11.979
But Diana--

05:11.979 --> 05:14.048
Ma, Diana's hard, all right?

05:14.048 --> 05:15.582
Yeah, hard enough
to look out for herself

05:15.582 --> 05:16.784
and sell my ass out.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.422
I'ma go to Stansfield
and see what I can find out.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.795
Diana Tejada's been arrested.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.363
I have to go to the precinct.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.931
Hold on, hold on.

05:30.931 --> 05:34.501
You are in no shape
to represent anyone tonight.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.771
Fuck, no.
But I got about 20 blocks

05:37.771 --> 05:38.839
to sober the fuck up.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.973
Ah!

05:39.973 --> 05:41.508
I'll go.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.810
You can do
the arraignment tomorrow.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.813
No, no, no, Monet Tejada'd
cut off my balls,

05:45.813 --> 05:48.582
and I like my balls, Cooper.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.518
Tell her I know the shit
they're gonna pull in there.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.787
I used to do it.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.855
You sure?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.457
Absolutely!

05:56.457 --> 05:57.725
I got this.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.994
I owe you one, my guy.

06:02.896 --> 06:06.400
And uh, take it easy
out here, huh?

06:18.412 --> 06:19.947
Look, this is all a setup.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.149
You got a call from a guy
named Salim, right?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.851
He's just trying to get back
at me for breaking up

06:23.851 --> 06:25.753
with him. Simple.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.588
No, not simple.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.590
We have you
on felony possession

06:29.590 --> 06:30.891
with intent to distribute, Diana.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.060
That's up
to nine years upstate.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.628
Okay, but you can't prove

06:34.628 --> 06:36.497
felony weight
from a photo, so...

06:36.497 --> 06:38.031
Oh! You're an expert.

06:38.031 --> 06:41.068
Yeah, the way you guys
harass my family, I have to be.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.437
We don't have just a photo.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.838
So book me then.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.941
We thought we'd give you
a chance to avoid that.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.042
I'm good.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.677
Besides,
I'm a first-time offender,

06:50.677 --> 06:53.180
so I'm looking at a misdemeanor
and community service.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.449
If the judge agrees.

06:55.449 --> 06:58.852
With your last name,
you think he's gonna do that?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.988
We know you're trying to turn
your life around, Diana,

07:00.988 --> 07:02.556
and we want to help.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.158
Clearly,
she knows how it works.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.727
You got to give to get,
right, <i>mamita</i> ?

07:13.634 --> 07:14.902
Yo, Davis.

07:14.902 --> 07:15.936
Hey, hey, hey, come on in.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.070
What's this about?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.972
Saxe was fucking lying, man.
A'ight?

07:18.972 --> 07:20.207
The Feds are looking
at me for Lauren Baldwin.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.042
It's part
of a fucking RICO case.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.177
A RICO?

07:23.177 --> 07:25.445
Yes.
- With the Feds?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.047
Yes, Davis, the fucking Feds!

07:27.047 --> 07:28.816
All right, how would Saxe
know about this?

07:28.816 --> 07:30.784
He's their fucking CI.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.853
Yeah.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.488
Who's this fucking coming from?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.859
Lauren Baldwin told me.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.194
Man, she's been alive
this whole time.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.462
She's been
in protective custody.

07:52.506 --> 07:53.740
<i>Whoa, Davis, Davis.</i>

07:53.740 --> 07:54.975
What the fuck you doing?
You can't do that, bro!

07:54.975 --> 07:56.643
Nigga, get the fuck
out my face!

07:56.643 --> 07:58.545
There's eyes on all of us!

07:58.545 --> 08:00.047
All of us!
You gotta fucking think, Davis.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.148
Come on!

08:03.183 --> 08:06.954
Fuck!

08:06.954 --> 08:08.689
Yo, just... just try
to stay calm, a'ight?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.023
We can't let Saxe know
that we on to him

08:10.023 --> 08:12.059
until we figure out
what the fuck he knows.

08:14.761 --> 08:18.732
That motherfucker is on his way
to the precinct right now.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.268
Diana Tejada got arrested.
He's representing her.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.070
Wait, wait, wait, what?

08:23.070 --> 08:24.271
That means anything
she tells him,

08:24.504 --> 08:25.672
he'll bring straight
to the fucking Feds.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.074
I know. I'm on my fucking way.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.609
Davis!
- I know.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.210
Act like he's not
a traitorous rat bastard.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.885
Even if I wanted
to help you out, I can't.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.820
I'm just trying
to get through college.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.623
A college
that you transferred into

08:42.623 --> 08:44.791
to be with Tariq St. Patrick.

08:44.791 --> 08:45.993
Tariq?

08:45.993 --> 08:48.028
The guy who used
to tutor my cousin?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.696
Cut the shit, Diana.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.632
We know he works
with your brother Cane.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.000
And Monet.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.303
She probably got him
to kill Dante Spears.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.272
Okay.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.841
So then who do you really want?

09:00.841 --> 09:04.244
You want Tariq,
or you want Monet?

09:07.915 --> 09:10.584
When Zeke died,
I did Diana dirty,

09:10.584 --> 09:11.885
but I was out of my head, Dru.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.187
She gotta understand that.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.992
That's not a cop knock.

09:18.992 --> 09:22.162
Well, go see
who the fuck it is.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.798
Shit.

09:29.937 --> 09:33.607
You better have a damn good
reason for showing up here.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.942
What is it, Tariq?

09:34.942 --> 09:38.178
<i>You got something to do
with Diana being arrested?</i>

09:38.178 --> 09:40.681
We all do.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.215
They're trying to hit us
with a fucking RICO, y'all.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.156
This is a RICO, Diana.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.858
You know how
that works, right?

09:51.858 --> 09:55.963
Any little thing you ever did
to help Tariq or your family

09:55.963 --> 09:57.130
with the drug business--
<i>Like, say,</i>

09:57.130 --> 09:59.032
putting a little product
into a locker.

09:59.032 --> 10:02.102
And you're looking
at 20 years' federal time.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.371
Well, I think you guys
are confused,

10:04.604 --> 10:07.307
because my family runs a bar.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.676
Damn!

10:09.676 --> 10:11.144
I mean, that's a lot
of dead bodies

10:11.144 --> 10:13.046
- for serving cocktails.
- Whoo!

10:13.046 --> 10:15.082
What, we got
Detective Whitman...

10:15.082 --> 10:16.283
Mm-hmm.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.684
Zeke...

10:17.684 --> 10:19.653
- Carrie.
- ...Carrie Milgram,

10:19.653 --> 10:20.988
Jabari Reynolds--

10:20.988 --> 10:22.723
Your dad.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.993
I mean, it goes
all the way back to Ramirez,

10:25.993 --> 10:28.795
the dirty cop that your mom
had between her legs

10:28.795 --> 10:31.231
till one of you popped him.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.767
I think you two are just
a couple of hood stans

10:33.767 --> 10:35.635
who watch way too much
<i>Law and Order.</i>

10:35.635 --> 10:37.337
Diana!

10:37.337 --> 10:39.039
I am not gonna lie to you.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.008
I'm going scorched earth
on this one.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.810
So the only question is,
which side of the bars

10:43.810 --> 10:45.812
you gonna be on
when the smoke clears?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.990
Hold on! Fuck.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.761
Oh, hell no.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.062
You pay my tuition
and you think

11:02.062 --> 11:03.130
you can just run up on me
like this?

11:03.130 --> 11:04.264
Relax, okay?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.033
Diana just got roped up.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.136
[whispers] Fuck.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.304
Come on.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.273
They brought her in
on possession.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.009
Now you know how she
might have got caught up?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.878
Listen, Effie, this could've
happened to any one of us.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.079
Yeah, but it didn't.
- You're right.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.147
You're right.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.214
It happened
to my little sister.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.315
All right? And I know y'all got

11:22.315 --> 11:23.784
the same bad taste
in scrawny niggas,

11:23.784 --> 11:24.818
but she's not gonna be sitting

11:24.818 --> 11:26.119
in no fucked-up-ass jail cell

11:26.119 --> 11:27.754
if there's anything
I can do about it.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.928
She was dealing
out the campus candy store.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.130
Maybe she got caught
on the roof camera.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.067
Bet. Say less.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.069
Cane?

11:42.069 --> 11:43.136
What's up?

11:45.305 --> 11:48.942
It was really nice,
what you did with my tuition.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.143
Yeah, well,
you really want this shit,

11:50.143 --> 11:53.313
and you're good at it, so...

11:53.313 --> 11:56.783
And you did it
with no expectations?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.251
I don't want shit from you.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.287
Why is that so hard
for you to believe, Effie?

12:02.823 --> 12:05.058
Because you are who you are.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.727
Yeah, well,
maybe you don't know me.

Cooper, what are
you doing here?

13:07.921 --> 13:10.223
I am representing
Diana Tejada.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.025
What?
I know.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.059
Too good to be true, right?

13:13.059 --> 13:14.895
Or too fucking unethical!

13:16.363 --> 13:18.465
Didn't we cross
that line a while back?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.534
You weren't pretending to be
Davis' legal counsel.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.202
It isn't worth
the risk, Cooper.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.904
We need this.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.205
We still don't know
their connect,

13:25.205 --> 13:27.274
where their stash house is,
who calls the shots.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.209
She could give us all of that.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.594
Yeah?

13:47.827 --> 13:48.828
<i>The Tejadas
are all caught up.</i>

13:48.828 --> 13:50.263
<i>- You good?</i>
- I got it.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.598
<i>A'ight, make sure
you take care of your end.</i>

13:51.831 --> 13:53.500
I said I got it.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.942
Go in with her and I'm just
gonna ask a few questions.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.109
She's gonna--

14:08.448 --> 14:10.317
She's gonna lead us
right to the--

14:11.952 --> 14:13.286
Hey, Davis. I was just--

14:13.286 --> 14:14.955
I was, uh, telling her

14:14.955 --> 14:16.890
that, uh, she can't question
our client

14:16.890 --> 14:17.958
without her attorney present.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.993
Uh, you decided to come.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.895
Two heads are better
than one, right?

14:23.263 --> 14:24.931
Ms. Sullivan.

14:26.399 --> 14:31.238
[whispers] Fuck. Fuck.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.209
Okay, Diana, first off,

14:36.209 --> 14:37.644
from now on,
you only talk to me.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.546
Us.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.181
You should be out real quick.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.617
I mean, they don't have a case
against you, and they know it.

14:43.617 --> 14:45.485
Well, they do have that video.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.554
And they might have gotten
the bag from the locker--

14:47.554 --> 14:50.890
A bag whose contents you have
zero firsthand knowledge of.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.525
Okay, okay.
Let's say that's true.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.261
We should still discuss who
told you about those lockers.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.328
Immaterial.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.529
She doesn't know
what was in the bag.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.897
Well, she hasn't exactly said.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.099
She hadn't said she does.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.300
Because we haven't heard
her side of the story.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.302
Oh, my--can you both
just shut up?

15:04.638 --> 15:07.173
You're right. Excuse us.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.174
We haven't even asked
what you want.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.376
Please, go ahead.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.211
They are threatening
to go after my family.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.079
So none of this falls
on anyone but me.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.347
Understood.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.682
Absolutely.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.018
But that might require you
to plead guilty,

15:18.018 --> 15:19.686
and as officers of the court,

15:19.919 --> 15:21.921
we can't let you do that
if you're, in fact, innocent.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.157
Okay.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.226
Well, what if I do know
what was in the bag?

15:26.226 --> 15:27.994
What if I--

15:27.994 --> 15:29.029
Oh, I'm...

15:29.029 --> 15:30.697
partner, I am so sorry.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.499
So, so sorry.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.267
<i>Ah! Oh, God.</i>

15:34.267 --> 15:35.468
You know what?
Come on. Come on.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.469
Let's go get that cleaned up, man.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.204
Jesus Christ, Davis!

15:38.204 --> 15:39.539
Yeah, that's gonna leave
a mark.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.475
We've got a sous vide
pork chop over here.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.011
Diana, I believe
we have enough for now.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.373
Oh, shit.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.208
I gotta dip.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.177
Ain't nobody
asked you to stay.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.045
Okay, Nola darling.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.714
Ain't nobody here
to shake up your lovin' bed.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.982
Shut up.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.724
No, but for real,
though, it's all good.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.425
I don't need you calling
and checking up on me,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.260
asking how I'm doing,
none of that bullshit.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.163
Yeah, well, actually,
I do have to call you.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.498
Remember?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.033
We're still
in business together.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.068
Mm-hmm.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.337
<i>Yo, Effie, could you talk?</i>

16:44.337 --> 16:45.772
You still fucking
with Slim Fit?

16:46.039 --> 16:47.340
No.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.176
<i>Real quick.
It's about business.</i>

16:51.444 --> 16:53.613
I don't feel like dealing
with this today, okay?

16:53.613 --> 16:55.382
So maybe you just--

16:55.382 --> 16:57.417
What? You mean hide
in the bathroom like a simp?

16:57.417 --> 16:59.152
Cane, 30 seconds.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.353
Please.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.388
This is crazy.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.335
Fuck do you want?

17:15.335 --> 17:18.738
Well, you wanted back
in the business, right?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.073
I got a job for you.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.441
A job?

17:21.441 --> 17:23.042
Nigga, who am I, TaskRabbit?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.177
Well, I need someone
to pick up the cups

17:24.177 --> 17:25.178
and fill out these orders.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.279
Fuck you!

17:26.279 --> 17:27.781
That's a job for a corner boy.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.482
Look, the Street's
got some heat right now.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.551
If the boys is hot,
we gotta get 'em the fuck

17:31.551 --> 17:34.454
off of Wall Street, Effie.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.822
It's true.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.357
But still, fuck you.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.826
You gotta make money.
I gotta move product.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.828
We don't got to like
each other to work.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.364
Tariq, I do this,
I want my own product.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.665
<i>All right, fine.</i>

17:45.665 --> 17:49.402
<i>One brick a week.
Go take care of it.</i>

17:57.510 --> 17:59.279
Sorry to bring you
out here for bad news,

17:59.279 --> 18:01.748
but when I stepped away,
shit got sloppy.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.616
But now I'm back,
making things right.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.452
First, we got to shut down
our operations

18:05.452 --> 18:06.719
for a couple of days.

18:06.719 --> 18:07.787
A couple days?

18:07.787 --> 18:09.856
- You know how much m--
- Shh!

18:10.089 --> 18:11.758
Let her finish.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.426
Look, the Feds
are watching us.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.829
As of right now, this ain't
got shit to do with y'all.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.131
They don't know
we workin' together.

18:18.131 --> 18:21.100
Y'all just lay low while
I dead this investigation.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.302
This shit will never touch you.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.703
Dead the investigation how?

18:23.703 --> 18:26.105
The less you know,
the better off you'll be.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.608
If we ain't in on this, we
ain't shutting down business. Fuck that!

18:28.608 --> 18:29.709
Hey!

18:29.709 --> 18:31.878
You watch your mouth!

18:32.111 --> 18:33.413
Yes, we do.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.648
I'm not losing
any more family to prison!

18:35.648 --> 18:37.283
You understand me?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.186
All right?

18:40.186 --> 18:41.387
Hmm?

18:44.324 --> 18:45.558
There's nothing more
to discuss.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.660
Come on. <i>Vamo.</i> Let's go.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.570
You know where Gordo is?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.806
He's not picking up
any of my calls.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.145
No, um...

19:06.145 --> 19:08.548
no, I haven't heard from him.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.417
Trouble in paradise, Romeo?

19:11.417 --> 19:12.685
No.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.487
No, we're all good.

19:31.237 --> 19:32.572
At my house, really?

19:32.572 --> 19:36.809
Walk with me.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.344
What the fuck
are you doing here?

19:38.344 --> 19:40.547
Just checking up
on my little Inspector Gadget.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.416
Not him, but, you know,
they do sort of look alike.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.485
KeKe?
Okay, look.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.719
When you didn't show up today,
me and Lucas thought

19:46.719 --> 19:47.854
we should check in,

19:47.854 --> 19:49.489
make sure you're
not overreacting.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.690
Overreacting.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.791
You're stealing
people's life savings

19:51.791 --> 19:53.259
and ruining their lives.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.327
Please!

19:54.327 --> 19:55.495
Those people
are rich, clueless.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.529
They'll never even miss it.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.530
Okay, so they're
not gonna miss

19:57.530 --> 19:58.765
their retirement accounts,

19:58.765 --> 20:00.400
pensions, none of that?
Are you kidding me?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.535
Brayden, you're a drug dealer.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.370
You sell people
poison for a living.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.538
Keep it down.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.940
Look, you're just
in your feelings right now

20:06.940 --> 20:09.375
because our clients
look and talk just like you.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.843
Not the Tejadas.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.378
Yeah, about that--

20:12.378 --> 20:14.414
Monet Tejada's been
calling all morning,

20:14.414 --> 20:16.916
demanding to have
a meeting with Lucas.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.885
You know we can't have
that kind of exposure.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.887
I know.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.322
Okay.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.324
So you're gonna put
your suit on

20:24.324 --> 20:25.658
and handle your investor.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.926
Capisce?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.836
Ma, what's up?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.805
What, you don't care
about this family no more?

20:38.805 --> 20:39.806
What you mean? I'm out here

20:39.806 --> 20:41.541
trying to help out Diana.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.009
You was helping
your dick, nigga.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.477
I ain't stupid.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.745
And while you up there
in that scholarship pussy,

20:45.745 --> 20:47.714
I'm out here trying
to handle the RICO

20:47.714 --> 20:49.349
that's about to bite us
in the ass.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.450
Wait, RICO? What RICO?

20:50.450 --> 20:51.451
The one they trying
to make Diana

20:51.451 --> 20:52.952
flip on us for.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.721
Yeah, nigga, so listen good.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.590
We are not moving
any product until I say so.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.492
Okay, you told Tariq this?
'Cause he's in motion.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.827
Tariq knows.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.462
And don't go breathing
a word of this shit to Effie,

21:02.462 --> 21:04.263
because she needs to think
we're business as usual.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.365
Fuck that!

21:05.365 --> 21:06.633
Y'all out here trying
to set up Effie?

21:06.633 --> 21:08.401
Boy, I done told you
everything you need to know,

21:08.401 --> 21:10.470
so don't go thinking
for yourself.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.839
'Cause then I'ma realize
I don't need you.

21:12.839 --> 21:13.973
That's why you say that shit.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.975
I say it
because it's true, Cane.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.310
Now I got to go
out there and clean up

21:17.310 --> 21:18.311
another one of your messes.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.312
The fuck did I do now?

21:19.312 --> 21:20.380
Weston Holdings.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.714
Nah, see?

21:21.714 --> 21:23.616
You can't handle
that I did some smart shit,

21:23.616 --> 21:25.284
some shit you would
have never thought of!

21:25.284 --> 21:27.020
Cane, you ain't do
no smart shit.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.022
You know we can't trust
them white boys on Wall Street.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.957
You gave our money to a bunch
of motherfuckers

21:30.957 --> 21:33.626
who never wanna see us do
well ever.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.895
Now I gotta go get it
the fuck back.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.563
And don't you go
talking to that girl,

21:37.563 --> 21:40.366
because this RICO shit is real,
and it's banging at our door.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.577
Yo! I've been calling you.
What the fuck?

21:51.577 --> 21:53.913
I've been dealing
with some work shit, bro.

21:53.913 --> 21:57.050
There's a fucking RICO
investigation into us, B.

21:57.050 --> 21:58.985
Wait, RI-RICO like YSL RICO?

21:58.985 --> 22:00.386
Yes, a fucking RICO!

22:00.386 --> 22:01.688
How do you know?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.056
I'll tell you later,
but right now,

22:03.056 --> 22:04.424
we need to focus
on deading No Cap

22:04.424 --> 22:05.858
for a few days, a'ight?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.427
Bro, now is not
the time to zone out.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.362
- Listen to me! Listen!
- I'm just processing the irony

22:09.362 --> 22:10.530
that I'm the Weston
being targeted

22:10.530 --> 22:11.898
by a federal investigation
right now.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.099
What do you mean?

22:13.332 --> 22:15.702
Weston Holdings
is a fucking Ponzi scheme.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.336
I saw the books.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.005
Wait, are you telling me this
whole fucking thing is a scam?

22:19.005 --> 22:20.106
Yes.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.641
But you can't say anything, okay?

22:21.641 --> 22:23.076
If my uncle finds out
that I told you,

22:23.076 --> 22:24.343
he'll out us for dealing.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.878
He knows
about fucking everything.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.748
B, that means my fucking
trust fund money is gone!

22:28.748 --> 22:30.383
Yeah, and the Tejadas'.

22:30.383 --> 22:33.486
If Monet wants that money back,
we're fucking dead!

22:33.486 --> 22:35.088
Yeah, we are
fucking dead, Brayden.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.823
You're not supposed
to agree with me, Tariq!

22:36.823 --> 22:37.990
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.025
- Hmm?
- I don't know.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.059
You always come up with a plan.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.661
You have something, right?

22:41.661 --> 22:42.929
I don't know, man.
All I can say is,

22:42.929 --> 22:44.363
I'm tired of being
on fucking defense, all right?

22:44.363 --> 22:45.965
We need to get
on offense for once.

22:47.467 --> 22:50.036
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

22:59.579 --> 23:02.081
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but the patio
is for members only.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.816
Ma'am?

23:03.816 --> 23:07.420
- Ma'am?
- Um, do you know her?

23:07.420 --> 23:08.554
Mr. Weston, I'm so sorry.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.423
Lenny, It's okay.
Ms. Tejada's a friend.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.658
Here, have a seat.

23:12.658 --> 23:13.893
Join us.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.895
All right, what can I...
what can I do for you?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.563
I've been trying to reach you,

23:17.563 --> 23:19.499
but I was told
you weren't available.

23:19.499 --> 23:22.568
Yes, well, I usually take
client meetings at the office.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.103
Well, I'm not one
of your usual clients.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.038
When I call,
you get on the phone.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.708
When I have questions,
you answer them.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.009
And the second I want
my money back,

23:30.009 --> 23:32.145
you give it to me.

23:32.145 --> 23:34.447
Am I clear?

23:34.447 --> 23:35.648
Hmm.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.884
A woman who speaks her mind.

23:37.884 --> 23:41.454
Ms. Tejada, I think
we have an understanding.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.523
And it's a real pleasure
to meet you.

23:45.691 --> 23:48.795
You should use sunscreen.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.129
You look a little pink.

23:52.565 --> 23:53.933
Ooh, that's good.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.908
Sorry.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.643
They only gave me
Fritos and a Sprite.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.645
No, I'm sorry

24:05.645 --> 24:07.713
about that meeting
last night with Davis.

24:07.713 --> 24:10.783
We just have
different defense strategies.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.820
Well, that's why I wanted
to talk to you alone.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.521
It's kind of fucked up, right?

24:15.521 --> 24:17.190
Yeah, I mean especially
because everything

24:17.190 --> 24:19.458
you tell us--well, me--

24:19.458 --> 24:21.160
is confidential.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.796
The thing is...

24:23.796 --> 24:26.499
I don't know
if I can trust Davis.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.668
He's looking out for
a lot of people,

24:28.668 --> 24:30.770
people like Monet.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.740
They do seem to have
a special relationship.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.843
And I'm just wondering,

24:36.843 --> 24:39.111
what if he's doing what's best
for her and not me?

24:40.646 --> 24:42.048
I would really hope
that's not the case.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.853
Listen,
if I tell you something,

24:46.853 --> 24:48.254
you won't tell anyone, right?

24:48.487 --> 24:50.156
That includes Davis.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.493
I promise.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.630
Diana, I just want
to get you out of here.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.067
Okay.

25:01.067 --> 25:04.270
Well, um, there's something
I think you should know.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.242
Effie Morales. She's our woman.

25:09.242 --> 25:11.043
We've already
been down that road.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.912
Effie doesn't connect
Tariq to anything

25:12.912 --> 25:14.580
beyond dealing at Stansfield.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.781
Until now.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.683
See, Tariq used to keep
his worlds separate,

25:17.683 --> 25:19.018
but he's letting Effie in,

25:19.018 --> 25:21.587
to the point where she's got
her hands in everything.

25:21.587 --> 25:22.955
So if we follow
her now, you think

25:22.955 --> 25:24.190
she could connect
the campus drugs

25:24.190 --> 25:25.925
to Wall Street and the Tejadas'
street business?

25:25.925 --> 25:27.693
I do. And if she does,

25:27.693 --> 25:29.595
she's also
the most likely to cooperate--

25:29.595 --> 25:31.697
straight-A student
who's got a future

25:31.697 --> 25:33.699
other than drug dealing.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.201
Where did you get this lead?

25:40.006 --> 25:42.675
From Diana Tejada.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.143
I'm representing her
on the drug arrest.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.978
Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

25:45.978 --> 25:49.015
This is privileged information
you got as her attorney.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.284
But it doesn't have to be
fruit of the poisonous tree.

25:51.284 --> 25:52.652
We have plenty on Effie

25:52.652 --> 25:53.953
to backfill
reasonable suspicion.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.155
She's on the rooftop camera,
and she's a named perp

25:56.155 --> 25:57.657
in Lauren's attempted murder.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.892
...which was clearly
retaliation on behalf

25:59.892 --> 26:01.594
of the drug organization.

26:01.594 --> 26:04.196
Real cute routine you two
got going on here.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.598
Did you practice in the tub?

26:05.598 --> 26:07.833
Blanca, let's do this,

26:07.833 --> 26:09.802
okay, before more people
get killed.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.109
If you're right,

26:17.109 --> 26:19.245
this blows your cover.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.947
You ready for that?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.352
I am.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.191
Okay.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.894
I'll put a tail on Morales.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.375
This is a business call, right?

26:49.608 --> 26:51.110
I mean, it was until you...

26:51.110 --> 26:53.379
came on here sounding
hella naked, and that's on you.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.382
But real talk.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.084
I heard Tariq asked
you to do that pickup.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.986
Sure you want to be his gofer?

26:59.986 --> 27:02.388
I'm sorry, what's that
got to do with you?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.857
I'm just saying, you sure
you trust this little nigga?

27:04.857 --> 27:08.828
Uh... Cane, if you have
something to say then say it.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.896
<i>Fuck!</i>

27:12.798 --> 27:14.233
Hey, let me hit you back.

27:20.373 --> 27:22.008
Fuck!

27:22.008 --> 27:23.642
Dude, what the fuck?

27:26.412 --> 27:28.280
<i>So, Everett, you came here</i>

27:28.280 --> 27:30.850
for a very specific purpose.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.351
- Is that right?
- Yes.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.687
I'd like my friends
and family and...

27:34.687 --> 27:36.122
<i>everyone, honestly,
to know something</i>

27:36.122 --> 27:38.424
<i>I've been keeping to myself
for a long time.</i>

27:38.958 --> 27:40.159
I'm gay.

27:41.227 --> 27:44.196
So why did you decide to come
on this show to say that?

27:44.196 --> 27:46.165
Because there isn't currently

27:46.165 --> 27:49.035
a single openly gay,
active NBA player.

27:49.035 --> 27:51.804
But we're here,
and we shouldn't have to hide.

27:51.804 --> 27:54.373
<i>So I'm done with all that.</i>

27:54.373 --> 27:56.809
So what's the support been like
from your teammates?

27:56.809 --> 27:57.910
They've been great.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.779
<i>Everyone's been really great.</i>

27:59.779 --> 28:02.014
<i>I couldn't do this
without them...</i>

28:02.014 --> 28:03.082
and my boyfriend.

28:03.082 --> 28:06.118
Ah yes, the BF.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.119
Nice to meet you.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.320
<i>Same here.</i>

28:08.320 --> 28:10.890
<i>So let's dish
for a second here.</i>

28:15.694 --> 28:16.896
Where you going?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.402
To drink till I black
the fuck out.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.883
<i>Welcome to the Stansfield University</i>

28:37.883 --> 28:39.285
<i>congressional debate</i>

28:39.285 --> 28:41.120
<i>between Councilman Rashad Tate</i>

28:41.120 --> 28:43.422
<i>and his opponent,
Annie Vuong-Han.</i>

28:45.224 --> 28:48.227
<i>We will be beginning momentarily.</i>

28:48.994 --> 28:50.296
I can't imagine
either of these

28:50.296 --> 28:52.131
will be the friend to us
that Sweeney was.

28:52.131 --> 28:55.334
Friends are often disguised
in the war paint of enemies.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.137
Do you really have
to talk like that?

28:58.137 --> 28:59.271
If you guys are gonna argue,

28:59.271 --> 29:00.973
can you not do it
with me in the middle?

29:00.973 --> 29:02.908
Thanks.

29:02.908 --> 29:06.245
Let's start with something
that's on all our minds:

29:06.245 --> 29:08.380
- rising crime rates.
- Mm.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.982
<i>What's your plan
to bring them down?</i>

29:11.016 --> 29:12.251
Ms. Vuong-Han?

29:12.251 --> 29:13.919
First, we need to look
at the details

29:13.919 --> 29:15.121
behind these numbers.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.289
Petty theft, trespass...

29:17.289 --> 29:19.391
these are crimes of poverty,
not of malice.

29:19.391 --> 29:23.028
Unlike my opponent here,
I actually come from poverty.

29:23.028 --> 29:26.432
And let me tell you, these
so-called crimes of poverty

29:26.432 --> 29:30.369
are daily intrusions
that tear away at our dignity,

29:30.369 --> 29:33.072
which is why I recently worked
with law enforcement

29:33.072 --> 29:35.141
to stop a major shipment
of drugs that were

29:35.141 --> 29:36.442
about to flood into our city.
And I--

29:36.442 --> 29:37.810
That was a publicity stunt

29:37.810 --> 29:39.979
motivated by self-interest
and cronyism,

29:39.979 --> 29:41.914
just like everything
Mr. Tate does.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.482
He wants to be
the man of the poor?

29:43.482 --> 29:46.218
Then why does his donor list
read like a who's who

29:46.218 --> 29:47.853
of Wall Street's
biggest crooks?

29:47.853 --> 29:52.358
Or a who's who of the brave,
risk-taking men and women

29:52.358 --> 29:54.193
who keep the city's economy going

29:54.193 --> 29:56.428
despite the demonization
of capitalism

29:56.428 --> 29:58.831
that makes
for a cool Instagram post,

29:58.831 --> 30:01.500
but not very smart
fiscal policy.

30:02.835 --> 30:03.969
See?

30:03.969 --> 30:05.237
We've got our man.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.908
<i>Let's move on
to another topic.</i>

30:08.908 --> 30:10.476
<i>Hey, man.</i>

30:10.476 --> 30:13.112
I'm gonna call it a day
unless you need me.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.547
No, all good.
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

30:14.547 --> 30:16.348
I'm glad you're
both still here.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.349
The--

30:17.349 --> 30:18.384
Before you say anything,

30:18.384 --> 30:21.353
I wanna apologize
to both of you.

30:21.353 --> 30:24.156
This transition to being out,
it ain't nothing.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.392
- And--
- Hey man, we get it.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.994
No apology necessary.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.963
<i>And I've got some good news.</i>

30:31.997 --> 30:34.400
Clinic says I'm
a great candidate.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.868
The treatment's
already working.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.170
Ah, pfft, couldn't
be happier for you, man.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.905
My nigga.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.540
May I have a fucking minute
with my own fucking brother,

30:41.540 --> 30:43.576
please?

30:43.576 --> 30:46.045
Yeah, sure, man.

30:46.045 --> 30:49.548
Uh... good night.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.022
Got a problem with white boy?

30:57.022 --> 30:58.424
I just don't need him knowing
every little thing

30:58.424 --> 31:00.226
about you and me.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.895
Hope you a lot better
in court, my brother.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.530
All right,
all right, all right.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.933
Look, I found out
last night that Saxe

31:07.933 --> 31:09.335
is working with the Feds.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.970
And you just let him walk
on out of here?

31:10.970 --> 31:13.138
I'ma take care of it, okay?

31:13.138 --> 31:16.175
I'm only telling you
because I'm worried

31:16.175 --> 31:17.610
it'll fuck with your release.

31:17.610 --> 31:19.311
I... I know, I know.

31:19.311 --> 31:22.181
I-I messed up,
and I'm real sorry, bro.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.350
You know, things might
work out better for you

31:24.350 --> 31:26.218
if you ain't always so sure

31:26.218 --> 31:28.087
you're the smartest
motherfucker in the room.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.363
Ah babe, let's eat.
I am starving.

31:37.363 --> 31:40.332
You want to give me your most
gentle ego-preserving feedback

31:40.332 --> 31:42.601
over a Melba's Mac and Cheese?

31:42.601 --> 31:46.405
I just saw you
talking to Lucas Weston.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.642
Honey, you know AVH is right.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.477
You're gonna be beholden
to those people.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.512
You're right.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.347
But I gotta get the job first.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.317
And as soon as I do, I'll quit
those seersucker motherfuckers

31:58.317 --> 31:59.985
and give everyone
free health care

31:59.985 --> 32:01.153
and an organic garden.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.488
Mm-hmm.
I promise.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.391
You know, buttercup, you got
to do better than that.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.558
I'm not convinced.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.496
Can I convince you to marry me?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.665
Oh, Rashad,
not this again.

32:12.665 --> 32:15.601
Yes, this again.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.703
- I'm serious.
- No!

32:17.936 --> 32:21.373
I'm just another thing
you need to win...

32:21.373 --> 32:23.375
the doting wife.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.312
Well, you're not
wrong about that.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.681
But also,
I... happen to love you.

32:31.517 --> 32:32.484
Stop it.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.053
I do.

32:34.053 --> 32:37.356
And you make me remember

32:37.356 --> 32:40.159
why I got into all this
in the first place.

32:40.159 --> 32:43.629
I mean, you're thoughtful.
You're brilliant.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.298
You know what?

32:46.298 --> 32:48.734
I'm gonna go ahead
and cancel that lunch meeting

32:48.967 --> 32:50.636
between myself
and Lucas Weston.

32:52.204 --> 32:55.374
Really?
Yeah.

32:55.374 --> 32:56.642
That's a good start.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.655
RSJ.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.490
I didn't see you
inside the debate, Tariq.

33:11.490 --> 33:15.627
Listen, I have something
I wanna speak to you about.

33:15.627 --> 33:20.632
I'm not sure
how I'ma say this, but...

33:20.632 --> 33:22.768
Weston Holdings
is a Ponzi scheme.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.672
How long have you known
about this?

33:26.672 --> 33:29.475
- I just found out.
- Okay.

33:29.475 --> 33:30.743
All right, all right.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.611
I'll take you
to the SEC tomorrow.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.079
You report what you know.

33:34.079 --> 33:35.214
We'll make sure
you're not implicated.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.348
No, no, no, no. You do that,

33:36.348 --> 33:37.349
you don't get a penny back

33:37.349 --> 33:38.617
from what you've invested.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.519
Are you suggesting
that I blackmail Lucas Weston?

33:40.519 --> 33:42.654
I'm suggesting that you
don't let him fucking rob you.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.556
Hold the fuck up.

33:44.556 --> 33:48.193
I worked my ass off to get here
by doing things the right way.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.195
I was walking away
from the Westons

33:50.195 --> 33:52.631
before your shady ass
pulled me back in.

33:52.631 --> 33:55.167
So let me be absolutely clear.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.369
I'm fucked, Tariq,
because of you.

33:57.369 --> 34:01.507
Look, I didn't know
about the Ponzi scheme.

34:01.507 --> 34:04.109
And with all due respect, RSJ,

34:04.109 --> 34:06.378
you're not the only one
that's fucked.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.347
All right?
So the question is,

34:08.347 --> 34:10.516
what are you willing to do
about this?

34:20.225 --> 34:22.728
Target approaching her vehicle
near northeast campus gate.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.174
<i>Let's go.
Target is on the move.</i>

34:35.174 --> 34:36.642
<i>We're tailing.</i>

34:59.865 --> 35:01.400
<i>Morales just made a pickup.</i>

35:01.400 --> 35:02.768
<i>Following to the next location.</i>

35:02.768 --> 35:04.503
<i>Requesting backup.</i>

35:15.614 --> 35:17.216
- Hey.
- You were right.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.517
Effie is leading us
to everything we need.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.452
Okay, uh, g-great.
That-that's great.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.754
Things are gonna move fast,
like within the day.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.890
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

35:32.197 --> 35:33.365
Yeah.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.234
Okay.

35:35.234 --> 35:39.137
And, Cooper, just be careful.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.369
Dru?

36:12.604 --> 36:13.906
Hey.

36:13.906 --> 36:15.507
Thought that was you.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.209
What up, Ev?

36:17.209 --> 36:19.645
I didn't know
you liked this place too.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.480
I was gonna tell you
I was in town.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.482
Oh, but no.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.751
But a nigga like me
ain't a good look

36:25.751 --> 36:29.488
for that gay celebrity shit
you doing now.

36:29.488 --> 36:30.522
Dru, you know...

36:30.522 --> 36:32.591
No, it's... it's fine.

36:32.591 --> 36:35.227
It's fine. I get it.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.429
I made my choice,
just like you did

36:37.429 --> 36:39.364
with your white boy
with stripes.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.666
Really?

36:40.666 --> 36:42.367
Ev, do you want me to--
<i>No, wait.</i>

36:42.367 --> 36:44.369
This is fine, doc.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.406
It's fine.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.708
<i>I'm happy for you.</i>

36:50.742 --> 36:52.911
Got yourself a good man.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.646
Dru, maybe we
should go outside.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.214
Don't you fucking touch me!

36:59.685 --> 37:01.587
You remember how you telling me

37:01.587 --> 37:03.655
that I didn't know
what I wanted?

37:05.591 --> 37:08.660
Well, I figured it out.

37:08.660 --> 37:12.497
I found someone for me.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.768
But never the fuck mind,
because that shit got

37:16.768 --> 37:18.570
so fucking fucked up that...

37:18.570 --> 37:22.407
that you-you wouldn't
possibly understand.

37:24.643 --> 37:28.580
So now he's... now he's gone.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.249
And... and-and-and-and-and-

37:31.249 --> 37:33.986
and I-I got nothing.

37:33.986 --> 37:37.022
I got nothing... nothing!

37:37.255 --> 37:38.624
You got everything,
and I got nothing.

37:38.624 --> 37:39.858
It's okay.
- Right?

37:39.858 --> 37:41.360
How does that--
how does that fucking work?

37:41.360 --> 37:42.794
Okay.
- How do you get nothing--

37:44.763 --> 37:45.931
It's all gonna be okay.

38:07.319 --> 38:08.887
Shit!

38:10.489 --> 38:11.657
Fuck.
Stop!

38:14.393 --> 38:15.494
Grab her! Stop running!

38:15.494 --> 38:16.595
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

40:16.915 --> 40:18.550

40:31.696 --> 40:34.199
I got nothing.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.701
This shit has gone viral.

40:36.701 --> 40:39.671
He told us everything was good.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.106
And still nothing from Gordo.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.515
We need to have
another conversation with Dru.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.595
Where's Dru?

41:03.595 --> 41:06.731
That's your son.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.066
Let's get this shit over with.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.568
All right.

41:09.568 --> 41:10.769
Well, with the Feds knowing
that we're on to them,

41:10.769 --> 41:11.837
they've got to regroup.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.038
So that buys us some more time.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.239
What's this?

41:14.472 --> 41:16.074
Skinny nigga Masterclass
on how to beat a RICO?

41:16.074 --> 41:17.209
Cane, shut up.
<i>So, Tariq...</i>

41:17.209 --> 41:18.543
Nigga always saying
some dumb shit.

41:18.543 --> 41:19.945
...you gonna go
after your man Saxe,

41:19.945 --> 41:21.947
or you gonna pull
a Lauren and chauffeur

41:21.947 --> 41:23.215
his snitch ass out of town?

41:23.215 --> 41:24.716
Because the nigga
got to get dead.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.084
Listen, I'll take care
of it, all right?

41:26.084 --> 41:27.853
Right now, we've got to worry
about getting a new distro

41:27.853 --> 41:29.154
for Wall Street
before Noma starts asking us

41:29.154 --> 41:30.488
more fucking questions.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.658
Fuck is this?

41:44.903 --> 41:47.105
I know what y'all did,
and I know why y'all did it.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.773
I don't understand why
you all had to leave me

41:48.773 --> 41:49.841
in the dark about it.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.076
A'ight, look, Effie.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.143
We needed someone
on the outside,

41:52.143 --> 41:53.578
and you weren't at risk.

41:53.578 --> 41:54.779
Well, you got a point.

41:54.779 --> 41:56.147
We shouldn't have left you
in the dark,

41:56.147 --> 41:59.017
but we here now.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.519
It's all good.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.221
I'da did the same shit
to any one of y'all.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.258
<i>Are you coming?</i>

42:06.258 --> 42:08.693
Enjoy the rest
of your Ted Talk, Ma.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.664
You knew about that?

42:12.664 --> 42:15.267
Look, I don't give a shit
about who's fucking who.

42:15.267 --> 42:17.168
We need to talk
about Weston Holdings.

42:17.168 --> 42:19.838
I don't trust that St. Bernard-
looking motherfucker for shit.

42:19.838 --> 42:23.241
And I want a cashier's check
of my full amount on Monday.

42:23.241 --> 42:25.777
Every penny, Tariq.

42:25.777 --> 42:27.746
Let yourself out.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.554
<i>Yo, what up, Riq?</i>

42:36.554 --> 42:38.290
Yo, we running out of time.

42:38.290 --> 42:39.724
We got to do this shit today.

42:43.762 --> 42:47.565
Sugar, pounds and pounds of it.

42:49.768 --> 42:51.603
Did they check everywhere?

42:51.603 --> 42:54.105
They knew
we were coming, Cooper,

42:54.105 --> 42:55.640
which means they knew
about you.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.710
No.

42:58.710 --> 43:01.079
Fuck, there's no way
Diana Tejada suspected me.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.014
There has to be
another explanation.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.015
I have one.

43:04.015 --> 43:05.817
Good. What is it?

43:05.817 --> 43:08.019
You're working for them,
and you set up

43:08.019 --> 43:09.854
this whole thing to burn me.

43:12.324 --> 43:14.726
Burn you?

43:14.726 --> 43:16.928
Jenny, I'm the one

43:16.928 --> 43:18.930
who just got
fucking burned here

43:18.930 --> 43:21.066
because
of your team's sloppy work.

43:21.066 --> 43:22.901
My team acted
off the intelligence

43:22.901 --> 43:24.169
that you gave them!

43:24.169 --> 43:25.236
And if they did it right, Tariq

43:25.236 --> 43:27.038
and his serial killer associates

43:27.038 --> 43:29.174
would be behind bars right now,

43:29.174 --> 43:31.876
not waiting
around the next fucking corner

43:31.876 --> 43:32.978
to kill me.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.846
I told you Diana was smart.

43:36.147 --> 43:38.083
Oh, my God.

43:38.083 --> 43:41.119
I have a target
on my back,

43:41.119 --> 43:43.855
and all you can say is,
"I told you so"?

43:43.855 --> 43:46.691
This affects me too.

43:46.691 --> 43:49.995
I banked everything
on this investigation,

43:49.995 --> 43:53.298
and now I have
shit all over me.

43:53.298 --> 43:57.168
I'm sorry, but I can't ask
for protection for you now.

44:00.171 --> 44:01.272
Phew.

44:03.375 --> 44:04.409
You know...

44:05.844 --> 44:09.647
You know Jenny,
for a while there...

44:10.648 --> 44:13.852
...it felt good to like you,

44:13.852 --> 44:16.788
to actually want
to be with you.

44:19.791 --> 44:21.693
But you will never know
what that feels like

44:21.693 --> 44:24.863
because the only thing
you're loyal to

44:24.863 --> 44:26.131
is your own fucked-up ambition,

44:26.131 --> 44:29.667
and that is
a lonely, miserable life,

44:29.667 --> 44:33.271
but it suits you.

44:35.974 --> 44:37.976
Fuck you, Saxe.

44:41.279 --> 44:42.680
Never again, Jenny.

44:44.115 --> 44:45.717
Never again.

44:59.130 --> 45:00.799
Tariq, it's Saxe.

45:00.799 --> 45:02.000
Listen.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.703
I know where Tasha
and Yas are, and if I die,

45:05.703 --> 45:07.772
that information does too.

45:10.909 --> 45:13.445
So call off your dogs and--

45:16.448 --> 45:19.150
Theo... Theo... listen.

45:19.150 --> 45:22.353
I promise none of this
affects you or your release.

45:22.353 --> 45:23.888
Shut the fuck up and drive.

45:42.841 --> 45:44.742
Well, I have
a dinner meeting to get to,

45:44.742 --> 45:47.212
but I can always make time for
my favorite limited partner--

45:47.212 --> 45:48.246
and the youth!

45:48.246 --> 45:49.314
So glad you brought them.

45:49.314 --> 45:51.082
Shut the fuck up, Lucas.

45:51.082 --> 45:55.153
I've never met a man with so
little integrity in my life.

45:55.153 --> 45:57.255
Whoa, sorry.
Wh-where is this coming from?

45:57.255 --> 45:59.290
I know it's a Ponzi, Lucas.

46:03.128 --> 46:05.897
RSJ, I am so sorry

46:05.897 --> 46:07.165
that you have found yourself

46:07.165 --> 46:10.835
in the middle
of a family squabble.

46:10.835 --> 46:12.137
But that is a lie

46:12.137 --> 46:15.340
that my drug dealing...

46:15.340 --> 46:18.143
<i>fuck-up nephew
is telling to cover--</i>

46:18.143 --> 46:19.444
Stop talking!

46:19.444 --> 46:21.479
I'll call the SEC tonight.

46:23.815 --> 46:26.484
Or we can handle it
another way,

46:26.484 --> 46:28.853
and I keep my mouth shut.

46:28.853 --> 46:31.890
In exchange, you return
every dollar of my investment

46:31.890 --> 46:35.260
and Tariq's trust fund.

46:35.260 --> 46:37.095
And, uh, the other thing, RSJ--

46:37.095 --> 46:40.331
And the Tejada money.

46:40.331 --> 46:44.169
You ungrateful,
entitled little...

46:45.537 --> 46:46.938
And you!

46:46.938 --> 46:48.506
Guess you think
this is the hood.

46:50.041 --> 46:51.509
Guess what? It is not.

46:51.509 --> 46:53.411
My nigga, this whole world
is the hood, all right?

46:53.411 --> 46:54.879
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>

46:57.448 --> 46:58.983
You're gonna regret this.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.585
Calm the fuck down, Lucas.

47:01.853 --> 47:04.989
And if you do anything
against Tariq or Brayden,

47:04.989 --> 47:06.157
I'll leave an anonymous tip

47:06.157 --> 47:07.492
with my friends
at the commission

47:07.492 --> 47:10.862
the second
I receive all my money.

47:10.862 --> 47:13.064
I guess we're all gonna have
to get along now.

47:13.064 --> 47:14.866
We're all in this together.

47:14.866 --> 47:17.035
I'm not in anything with you,

47:17.035 --> 47:20.338
but I can't disagree
that I find myself...

47:20.338 --> 47:25.243
uh, skewered ass to mouth like
a suckling pig over hot coals.

47:27.045 --> 47:29.480
But as is the nature
of these situations,

47:29.480 --> 47:33.117
I don't currently have
the funds for repayment.

47:33.117 --> 47:35.553
I've created a repayment plan
based on your rate

47:35.553 --> 47:36.988
of new investment.

47:36.988 --> 47:38.323
Let's just hope
the Feds don't find out

47:38.323 --> 47:40.058
until I'm paid in full.

47:40.058 --> 47:41.859
Oh, I've got that covered.

47:48.967 --> 47:52.136
<i>MJ, The Musical,</i>
front row, you and I--

47:52.136 --> 47:53.304
boom.

47:53.304 --> 47:56.007
Mwah!

47:56.007 --> 48:00.011
Ain't so bad being
my plus one, now is it?

48:00.011 --> 48:03.481
I had an interesting chat
with Brushaundria today.

48:03.481 --> 48:04.882
Oh, no, no, listen.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.618
I'm not trying to look
at any intern's titties.

48:06.618 --> 48:09.621
I mean, it's not my fault them
just be jiggling and twerking

48:09.621 --> 48:11.623
- around the damn office.
- Rashad...

48:11.623 --> 48:15.627
she said that
you met with Lucas Weston.

48:16.961 --> 48:18.329
After you told me you wouldn't.

48:20.031 --> 48:21.132
You're right.

48:21.132 --> 48:22.133
I--

48:23.134 --> 48:25.236
I lied, okay, and I'm sorry.

48:25.236 --> 48:26.237
Okay?

48:26.237 --> 48:27.939
But you know what, baby?

48:27.939 --> 48:30.408
Starting right now,
in this very moment,

48:30.408 --> 48:32.443
we're gonna have
a fully honest relationship.

48:32.443 --> 48:34.412
I've been honest
with you, Rashad.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.014
So a brother's off
to a slow start.

48:36.014 --> 48:38.283
Not funny.

48:38.283 --> 48:39.317
Okay, listen.

48:39.317 --> 48:40.618
Here's everything.

48:40.618 --> 48:42.987
Not only did I meet
with Weston today,

48:42.987 --> 48:45.456
I also accepted
a campaign donation.

48:46.658 --> 48:49.560
A donation?

48:49.560 --> 48:51.496
You have to give that back.

48:52.397 --> 48:54.699
Give it... give it back.

48:54.932 --> 48:58.136
No, no, see, uh, I did...

48:58.136 --> 48:59.637
that I cannot do.

48:59.637 --> 49:02.607
You know?
I'm into this honesty thing.

49:02.607 --> 49:05.310
I'm just not into losing.

49:05.310 --> 49:06.644
Okay.

49:06.644 --> 49:10.381
That's funny,
because you're losing me.

49:21.292 --> 49:24.295
<i>Tariq. It's Saxe. Listen.</i>

49:24.295 --> 49:27.565
<i>I know where Tasha
and Yas are, and if I die,</i>

49:27.565 --> 49:31.202
<i>that information does too.</i>

49:33.104 --> 49:35.640
<i>So call off your dogs--</i>

49:35.640 --> 49:37.275
And this shit just ends.

49:37.275 --> 49:39.143
Called him, like, ten times,
no answer, nothing.

49:39.143 --> 49:41.479
We've got to get to him
before the Tejadas do.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.481
That motherfucker ain't stupid.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.116
He's probably bluffing.

49:45.116 --> 49:47.985
Either way, I'm sure he's
halfway to some family bunker

49:47.985 --> 49:49.387
in Montana by now.

49:53.324 --> 49:55.026
I gotta take this.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.032
MacLean.

50:01.032 --> 50:02.400
Yes, I'm his emergency contact.

50:04.268 --> 50:06.104
But he told me
the treatments were working.

50:06.104 --> 50:08.740
Yes.

50:08.740 --> 50:10.141
I understand.

50:14.145 --> 50:15.713
<i>This is Theo.
Do the thing you do here.</i>

50:15.713 --> 50:17.248
Theo.

50:17.248 --> 50:18.516
Why have you been lying
about your treatments?

50:18.516 --> 50:21.352
Hmm? Stop fucking ignoring me!

50:21.352 --> 50:23.454
Yo, you good?

50:23.454 --> 50:26.023
No. I'm not good.

50:26.023 --> 50:29.093
My brother's fucking dying,
and he won't pick up my calls.

50:29.093 --> 50:30.361
Shit.

50:30.361 --> 50:33.631
You have any idea
where he could be?

50:33.631 --> 50:35.400
What time did you get
Saxe's voicemail?

50:37.668 --> 50:39.203
Hour ago. <i>Fuck.</i>

50:39.203 --> 50:40.304
What?

50:40.304 --> 50:41.539
I told Theo Saxe betrayed me,

50:41.539 --> 50:42.540
and-and now I think

50:42.540 --> 50:43.775
he's gonna make him pay.

50:43.775 --> 50:45.443
Fuck, man, your brother's
with Saxe?

50:45.443 --> 50:47.645
Until the crazy motherfucker
kills him, yes.

50:47.645 --> 50:49.347
Davis, if Saxe dies,
we're fucked.

50:49.347 --> 50:51.149
Hey, shut up already.

50:51.149 --> 50:52.583
I think I might know
where they are.

50:59.590 --> 51:01.592
Ma.

51:03.594 --> 51:06.330
You okay?

51:06.330 --> 51:07.565
You did good, baby girl.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.534
Yeah, but my charges
are still pending.

51:09.534 --> 51:11.402
- Davis will handle those.
- He better.

51:11.402 --> 51:12.470
What I just say?

51:12.470 --> 51:14.105
Ma, and that ain't all.

51:14.105 --> 51:16.240
I want out... out the game
and out of New York.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.709
I'm thinking I can transfer
to Spelman at semester.

51:18.709 --> 51:20.244
And I know you got enough
to cover

51:20.244 --> 51:21.679
tuition and living expenses.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.848
It'd be a fresh start for me.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.684
Fresh start.

51:26.684 --> 51:29.554
I'll give you a fresh slap
upside your fucking head.

51:29.554 --> 51:31.255
Go get in the car, Diana.

51:41.199 --> 51:42.667

53:14.692 --> 53:15.893
You have the right
to remain silent.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.495
Anything you say
can and will be used

53:17.495 --> 53:18.863
against you in a court of law.

53:19.864 --> 53:21.265
Get the fuck off of me!

53:21.265 --> 53:22.466
Hey, y'all got

53:22.466 --> 53:24.268
Why, you her lawyer?

53:24.268 --> 53:25.303
Why don't you shut the fuck up

53:25.303 --> 53:26.771
before I bring your ass in too?

53:26.771 --> 53:28.272
<i>Let's go.</i>

53:50.861 --> 53:52.797

53:52.797 --> 53:54.699

and you know it.

53:54.699 --> 53:57.668
You're not being arrested
for drug dealing, Effie.

53:57.668 --> 54:00.237
Then what fucking for?

54:00.237 --> 54:02.807
Attempted murder.

54:07.945 --> 54:09.547
Yeah, that's her.

54:09.547 --> 54:12.350

that tried to kill me.

54:30.701 --> 54:31.936
This way.

54:31.936 --> 54:33.738
Move it.
Move. Get in the car.

54:33.738 --> 54:35.706
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

54:51.622 --> 54:54.625
Theo, Theo, I promise you,
I will disappear forever!

54:54.625 --> 54:56.327
That's exactly

Come on, man, you're free.
You're free, okay?

54:57.995 --> 54:59.397
- Shut up!
- You don't have to do this.

54:59.397 --> 55:00.731

55:02.400 --> 55:03.634
<i>Theo. Theo, wait.</i>

55:03.634 --> 55:04.902
<i>- Please, Theo--</i>
- Theo!

55:04.902 --> 55:06.504
Put the fucking gun down!

55:06.504 --> 55:07.805
Get the fuck out
of here, Davis!

55:07.805 --> 55:08.939
Davis, thank you. Listen, man--

55:08.939 --> 55:10.074
Shut the fuck up, Saxe!

55:10.307 --> 55:11.542
This traitor gotta go,
little brother.

55:11.542 --> 55:12.777
And I'm the perfect one
to do it.

55:12.777 --> 55:15.079
Look, it's not over for you,
okay, bro?

55:15.312 --> 55:17.348
Look, there'll be more
treatments, more clinics.

55:17.348 --> 55:19.417
No, man, it is over. It's over.

55:19.417 --> 55:22.019
<i>I lied about the treatment so
you'd stop worrying about me.</i>

55:22.019 --> 55:23.721
I've got a month at best.

55:23.721 --> 55:25.389
<i>Yo, you pull that
trigger, you only making shit</i>

55:25.389 --> 55:26.490
worse for Davis.

55:26.490 --> 55:27.558
Listen to
your fucking brother, man.

55:27.558 --> 55:30.094
He's right, Theo.
Theo, look at me.

55:30.327 --> 55:33.030
Put the gun down,
please, for me.

55:33.030 --> 55:35.366
You'll be fine, brother.

55:35.366 --> 55:37.334
Besides, this ain't about you!

55:37.334 --> 55:39.737
See, you ain't never think
about what I want.

55:40.838 --> 55:41.806
This is it.

55:41.806 --> 55:43.007
No, Theo, listen, please!

55:56.787 --> 55:58.723
Oh, God, Jesus!

55:58.723 --> 56:00.958
Fuck! No, no, no, no, no, Theo!

56:00.958 --> 56:03.060
Theo! Theo! Look at me, Theo.

56:03.060 --> 56:04.395
<i>Look at me.</i>

56:04.395 --> 56:05.963
<i>Give me the fucking gun.
Okay?</i>

56:05.963 --> 56:06.964
Give me the fucking gun.

56:06.964 --> 56:08.466
I can still fix this.

56:08.466 --> 56:10.568
You're not taking
the blame for this.

56:10.568 --> 56:12.803
I'm not letting you
go back to prison.

56:12.803 --> 56:14.839
You right about that, baby bro.

56:15.906 --> 56:18.109
We both free now.

56:19.110 --> 56:20.745
Oh, fuck!

56:20.745 --> 56:22.580
Motherfucker!

56:22.580 --> 56:24.949
God damn it, Theo, why?

56:27.384 --> 56:29.420
Oh, my...

56:31.055 --> 56:33.057
Motherfucker!

56:35.459 --> 56:38.496
Why would you do that?

56:39.630 --> 56:42.500
Why would you do that?
