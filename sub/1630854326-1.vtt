WEBVTT

00:20.521 --> 00:23.982
Wow. Did your plane get bigger
since the last time I was on it?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.692
I don't think so.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.987
Maybe you got smaller. Come on.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.871
Morning.
-Morning.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.000
Oh, God.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.755
Thank you, Joe.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.927
So, I've got a great trip planned
for us, Hugo.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.346
Don Pablo's memorial is tomorrow,

00:54.346 --> 00:57.349
but today, after we land in Acapulco,

00:57.349 --> 01:02.312
I'm gonna show you some of the most
special places in the city to me. Look.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.899
We're gonna-- Joe.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.443
Why is this place on here?

01:09.778 --> 01:12.030
Oh, yeah. In case you wanted to stop by.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.366
I thought I told you
I did not want to stop by.

01:14.366 --> 01:15.492
You did.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.079
But you might change your mind.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.914
I am not going to change my mind.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.041
Is that clear?
-What are you two talking about?

01:23.125 --> 01:27.588
Somewhere Joe wants us to go
that we are for sure not going to go to.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.714
But we might.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.008
Are you going to tell me where?

01:32.509 --> 01:34.678
I'm gonna do something better than that.

01:34.678 --> 01:39.391
I'm gonna change the subject so that you
can forget all about this conversation.

01:39.391 --> 01:43.353
Now it's time for another chapter
of my triumphant,

01:43.437 --> 01:48.567
heartwarming, wonderfully inclusive,
mostly true, rags-to-riches life story.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.652
Okay. Here we go.

01:52.571 --> 01:56.366
<i>It was the first day of 1985,
a time of new beginnings.</i>

01:56.909 --> 02:01.747
<i>But, unfortunately, I couldn't get
the last night of 1984 out of my brain.</i>

02:02.372 --> 02:04.041
<i>Julia and Chad's engagement.</i>

02:05.417 --> 02:06.877
<i>My fight with Don Pablo.</i>

02:07.794 --> 02:08.961
<i>Héctor and Diane.</i>

02:10.714 --> 02:15.427
<i>The bracelet I bought for Julia
that had suddenly lost all its meaning.</i>

02:17.638 --> 02:21.099
<i>Still, I was determined
to put the night before behind me.</i>

02:21.183 --> 02:25.812
Come on, Máximo.
Stay positive. New year. New you...

02:25.896 --> 02:26.897
<i>At the same time,</i>

02:26.897 --> 02:30.692
<i>my mother was also trying to make sense of
what happened on New Year's Eve.</i>

02:30.776 --> 02:32.319
My love.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.030
So, remember your Uncle Ramón

02:35.030 --> 02:40.869
whom we suspected was maybe not just a

02:40.911 --> 02:44.831
"fun, single bachelor" his whole life?

02:45.582 --> 02:48.585
I'm starting to wonder if our daughter...

02:49.044 --> 02:50.629
is an Uncle Ramón.

02:50.671 --> 02:54.758
I think I saw Sara and Roberta

02:54.800 --> 02:59.721
doing something that
might have been a bit... Ramón like?

02:59.763 --> 03:01.098
Good morning, Mama.
-Good morning!

03:01.139 --> 03:04.643
I'm not overreacting!
You're underreacting!

03:06.061 --> 03:07.980
Happy New Year!

03:08.856 --> 03:11.316
Happy New Year, my love.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.735
Wow, why do you look so different?

03:13.777 --> 03:16.530
Oh, I know. Your bandages are off!
How are your eyes? Can you see?

03:16.572 --> 03:17.990
I can see everything.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.200
Why is your hair like that?

03:20.659 --> 03:22.744
You don't have to tuck in your shirt
at work?

03:23.245 --> 03:24.288
You look tired...

03:24.329 --> 03:26.790
I think I liked you better the other way.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.917
I'll see you tonight. Have a great day!

03:28.959 --> 03:31.295
You too, my angel.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.088
I'll try!

03:41.930 --> 03:43.390
I'm serious.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.893
I really think
Lupe is going to fire me today.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.270
For making out with her niece?

03:48.312 --> 03:52.608
Half for making out with her niece.
Half for giving her the middle finger.

03:54.193 --> 03:58.238
Man, I loved this place.
And the people.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.823
And this shrub.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.910
I really loved this shrub right here.

04:03.202 --> 04:05.954
Goodbye shrub. We had a good run.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.417
Don't worry, Memo. Héctor got
promoted to head pool boy last night,

04:10.459 --> 04:13.962
which means there's an
opening at the pool, which means

04:14.004 --> 04:15.756
I'm getting you that job today!

04:15.797 --> 04:18.257
It's always been our dream to
work at the pool together.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.594
You really think you can convince Héctor?

04:20.636 --> 04:23.972
Of course! How hard can that be?

04:24.515 --> 04:27.643
Goodbye curb, goodbye palm tree,

04:27.684 --> 04:30.979
goodbye mean security guard
who never remembers my name...

04:38.445 --> 04:40.072
Happy New Year!

04:41.281 --> 04:45.160
I want to hear everyone saying that
to our guests today.

04:46.119 --> 04:50.332
Please also remember all the guests
are hungover from last night.

04:50.332 --> 04:54.920
So, Augusto, Adriana, no Mötley Crüe.

04:56.296 --> 05:01.301
Lastly, at 6:00 p.m. today,
our New Year's Day ritual,

05:01.385 --> 05:04.054
releasing baby turtles into the ocean.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.891
Yes. I love this tradition.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.812
<i>Seeing Julia again,
knowing that she was now engaged...</i>

05:12.396 --> 05:14.314
<i>Well, it sucked, Hugo.</i>

05:14.398 --> 05:16.900
Now, everyone, get to work.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.948
<i>Still, I was not going to let
my hurt feelings for Julia</i>

05:22.948 --> 05:26.827
<i>get in the way of
the very first day of 1985.</i>

05:28.287 --> 05:30.706
<i>Which is why I decided
to avoid her altogether.</i>

05:32.457 --> 05:35.544
Hey, you. I just realized...
-Hey.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.173
...we never got to finish our whole
"are we engaged or not?" convo last night.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.425
What do you think?
Should we make a pros and cons list?

05:41.425 --> 05:44.595
I really do wanna keep talking,
but I have to go help at the front desk.

05:44.595 --> 05:45.971
Can we talk later?

05:45.971 --> 05:50.100
Absolutely, yeah. See? First pro.
I am very understanding.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.518
Okay. Bye.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.270
All right, yeah.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.329
Héctor!

06:17.252 --> 06:18.253
Héctor?

06:21.548 --> 06:22.549
Héctor?

06:25.761 --> 06:27.763
Héctor!
-English, please.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.974
Hector!
-Very good, Máximo.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.144
Welcome to my new office.
Would you like a tour?

06:35.604 --> 06:37.481
Wait, are you--
-Right here is my desk,

06:37.481 --> 06:40.234
over there is the coffee station,

06:40.234 --> 06:44.488
and over here is where
this boss-level magic happens.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.075
Not bad for a humble Spaniard, no?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.953
Oh, it's incredible.

06:50.953 --> 06:54.122
And congratulations
on becoming head pool boy.

06:54.206 --> 06:57.251
You clearly deserved it
more than... anyone else.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.335
Thank you.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.213
Also, it helped
that I am screwing the boss.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.466
Here, please, sit anywhere you like, eh?

07:06.635 --> 07:07.636
Please.

07:11.139 --> 07:15.561
So, I know in the past you and I were,
maybe, not so nice to each other.

07:15.561 --> 07:16.770
But you won!

07:16.854 --> 07:18.355
And I think we should start over.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.191
So now, as my new boss/friend,

07:21.275 --> 07:23.819
what do you think about hiring Memo
for your old job?

07:27.656 --> 07:30.075
Does this mean a lot to you?

07:30.409 --> 07:34.872
Yes. It means everything. It's what
we've wanted our entire lives.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.749
Wrong answer.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.751
Listen, Máximo, I would love to help you,

07:39.835 --> 07:43.213
but it is very, very, very, very hard
for me to focus right now.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.548
See this chair?

07:53.432 --> 07:56.226
It is not rolling very well,
as you can see.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.769
Do you know why?

07:58.270 --> 07:59.688
Because...

08:01.023 --> 08:02.441
it doesn't have wheels?

08:02.441 --> 08:06.778
That's right. And who's heard of a boss's
chair that doesn't have any wheels on it?

08:08.530 --> 08:12.201
I can't think about anything else
until this gets fixed.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.332
So, you want me to get you a rolly chair?

08:18.332 --> 08:21.210
Oh, my God, what a great idea, Máximo.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.379
Actually, bring me a couple options.
I like choices.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.299
You can find your own way out.

08:29.968 --> 08:33.054
Hello? Where is everybody?

08:37.558 --> 08:38.727
Lupe?

08:45.734 --> 08:46.735
Lupe?

08:49.821 --> 08:50.822
Lupe!

09:00.123 --> 09:01.917
Hello, Memo.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.962
Ah! Where... is everyone?

09:05.003 --> 09:09.007
All the other employees
are out sick today.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.761
Well, in that case,
I guess you couldn't fire me

09:12.845 --> 09:15.305
even if you wanted to, huh?

09:15.347 --> 09:18.934
Oh, I'm not allowed to fire someone
for personal reasons.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.519
I checked.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.689
But if you fail at doing your job
properly--

09:23.730 --> 09:26.400
that's a whole other story.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.652
Oh, by the way,

09:28.902 --> 09:32.573
all the laundry machines are broken.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.074
Hey, but I see...

09:34.116 --> 09:37.035
You need to hand wash all the sheets

09:37.077 --> 09:38.412
and all the towels

09:38.453 --> 09:41.665
for the entire resort
by the end of the day.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.460
...And if I don't?

09:45.502 --> 09:49.173
Then you lose the job.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.258
And the girl.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.594
Why would I lose Lorena, too?!

09:53.635 --> 09:57.764
My niece only likes working men.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.485
Welcome back to...

10:10.527 --> 10:12.196
Espectacular!

10:12.237 --> 10:16.158
All the news you never knew
you needed to know.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.077
I'm your host, Fabián Solares,

10:19.119 --> 10:21.246
"The Gossip Swan."

10:21.288 --> 10:25.626
And while your daughter's
favorite band Menudo may seem innocent,

10:26.084 --> 10:30.088
what they did over the holidays
just might surprise you...

10:30.547 --> 10:32.132
(on tv)
<i>"Last week..."</i>

10:32.216 --> 10:35.761
<i>"...the group went to the beach
for a well deserved break--"</i>

10:36.470 --> 10:39.097
Those boys are very cute.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.517
Aren't they, Sara?

10:44.061 --> 10:47.481
Tell me-- which is your favorite?
Robby Rosa? Charlie Masso?

10:47.523 --> 10:51.527
Give him a few years and I think you and
Ricky Martin would be quite the couple!

10:51.944 --> 10:53.570
Personally, I'm a Johnny guy.

10:53.612 --> 10:57.616
He may not be the handsomest
but he's holding the group together.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.618
Can we talk about something else?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.411
Anything else?

11:01.703 --> 11:04.581
You're spending too much time with
Máximo's girlfriend!

11:04.623 --> 11:06.208
What...

11:06.250 --> 11:08.627
does that mean?

11:09.419 --> 11:12.214
It means you're together every second.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.757
She's a bad influence!

11:13.799 --> 11:17.427
Isn't there a nice boy you want to
hang out with instead?

11:17.469 --> 11:20.180
Honestly, you're the only mom I know

11:20.222 --> 11:23.183
who wants her daughter
to spend more time with boys!

11:23.225 --> 11:26.603
And I agree. Johnny all the way.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.147
See? It's clearly Johnny...

11:41.743 --> 11:44.413
Diane? Good morning.

11:44.413 --> 11:48.333
It is. It's an excellent morning.

11:49.168 --> 11:50.586
Is something wrong?

11:50.586 --> 11:53.172
I was out with the investors
until 5:00 a.m.

11:53.172 --> 11:55.299
We drank each other under the table.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.595
I think. All I know is I woke up
under a table.

12:00.429 --> 12:04.099
But, damn it, it was worth it
because they're giving us the money.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.351
The resort is saved!

12:07.311 --> 12:08.729
Not so loud, Diane.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.689
That's wonderful news.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.026
I also had a big night last night.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.404
My son Víctor visited me with my grandson.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.824
I'm sorry. I have to close my eyes.
I'm not sleeping.

12:20.908 --> 12:24.536
Just when everything's rocking this much,
I like to pretend I'm on a yacht. Go on.

12:25.412 --> 12:30.626
Eighteen years. That's how much time
I lost with my son. But in a way--

12:32.127 --> 12:34.671
What is that noise
and how can we murder it?

12:36.298 --> 12:37.299
Máximo.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.971
What are you doing?!
-I need a chair.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.806
Or... two?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.059
Take them from the supply closet!

12:47.100 --> 12:48.810
And come find me later.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.980
I need to talk to you about last night.

12:54.066 --> 12:56.109
<i>Don Pablo was clearly still mad at me</i>

12:56.193 --> 12:58.946
<i>for the way I had talked to him
the night before.</i>

12:58.946 --> 13:01.406
<i>I wasn't going to be able
to avoid him forever.</i>

13:02.324 --> 13:03.992
<i>Julia, on the other hand...</i>

13:17.840 --> 13:18.882
Máximo.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.343
<i>Nope. I couldn't avoid her either.</i>

13:22.803 --> 13:24.221
Oh, Julia, hi.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.932
Okay, that's the second time
I see you hiding from me today.

13:26.932 --> 13:30.644
What? Me? No. That's not what I was doing.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.728
Hey, I--

13:33.772 --> 13:38.527
Look, I get it. Must have been really
weird to see that whole proposal.

13:38.527 --> 13:43.198
To be honest,
it was weird to get that proposal.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.410
Really? I thought it was lovely.

13:46.410 --> 13:47.494
Very...

13:48.996 --> 13:49.997
Chad.

13:50.956 --> 13:54.084
Well, I just wanna make sure
you're okay, we're okay.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.213
I don't know. I just didn't like the way
things ended between us last night.

13:58.297 --> 14:02.926
I'm fine. We're fine.
Don't worry about me or us or you or them.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.053
Gotta go.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.446
Excuse me.

14:24.072 --> 14:28.160
If you need something to write with,
or lots of things to write with,

14:28.160 --> 14:30.245
I can send more pens to your room.

14:30.329 --> 14:32.623
I'm not staying here. I'm stealing these.

14:32.623 --> 14:34.458
Oh, I see.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.043
Security!
-Hey, wait! Hold on.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.170
We haven't even met yet. I'm Isabel.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.714
Máximo. Nice to meet you. Security!

14:40.714 --> 14:43.383
Security?
-I'll explain.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.386
You know the "authentic local pozole"
on your lunch menu?

14:46.428 --> 14:50.682
That's from the "authentic local
restaurant" I work at. I do the delivery,

14:50.724 --> 14:53.185
I've just been away the last few months.

14:53.227 --> 14:56.980
And in return for the pozole,
the hotel pays you... in pens?

14:57.022 --> 15:00.692
I hate these hotels. They rob
tourists blind, they leech off us locals...

15:01.568 --> 15:04.863
but the restaurant has to
do business with them to survive.

15:04.905 --> 15:08.283
So, each time I drop off the pozole,
I take a little something back.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.786
Nothing big.
It's just my tiny act of defiance.

15:10.827 --> 15:15.749
Ahh, got it. Then I guess I won't
be needing the handcuffs...

15:15.791 --> 15:18.252
Too bad. What was your name again?

15:18.293 --> 15:21.755
Máximo. I'd write it down for you,
but we're out of pens.

15:38.522 --> 15:40.691
Let's go with this one.
-Great choice.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.234
So is Memo hired?

15:42.234 --> 15:43.777
Who?
-Memo.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.992
I want to help you. I really do.

15:50.367 --> 15:54.121
But I couldn't hire a candidate without...

15:55.080 --> 15:56.039
...conducting an interview first.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.293
I'll go get him...

15:59.293 --> 16:02.129
Sorry, amigo,
I don't make the rules. Wait.

16:02.838 --> 16:03.922
Yes, I do.

16:07.342 --> 16:10.512
Join us for the turtle release
at 6:00 p.m. It's very special.

16:11.180 --> 16:13.682
Baby turtles.
-Isabel!

16:15.642 --> 16:17.352
You're back!

16:17.644 --> 16:20.731
How was your trip around
South America with Miguel?

16:20.772 --> 16:22.191
It was amazing...

16:22.232 --> 16:23.942
...once I got rid of Miguel.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.652
He turned out to be a jerk,

16:25.694 --> 16:27.112
so one morning in Lima

16:27.154 --> 16:29.448
I snuck out of our hotel
with all of my stuff.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.074
And also all of his stuff.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.369
What? I left him an extra pair of socks.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.121
I'm not a monster.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.665
Well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.

16:38.707 --> 16:43.504
Don't be. I'm thrilled to be back!
I missed my family. I missed Acapulco.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.214
I missed you.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.424
I never want to leave again.

16:47.466 --> 16:48.550
Now,

16:49.259 --> 16:51.011
tell me about your engagement!

16:51.053 --> 16:52.888
You already heard about that?

16:52.930 --> 16:56.767
I think half of Mexico already heard!
So, c'mon already! Show me the ring!

16:59.353 --> 17:00.854
It's pretty.

17:02.731 --> 17:03.815
What's wrong?

17:05.901 --> 17:08.612
I know I should be happy about...
all of it. It's just -

17:09.863 --> 17:12.074
Things with us have been a little...
up-and-down lately...

17:12.115 --> 17:13.367
And then Chad went and did this super

17:13.407 --> 17:16.411
embarrassing proposal in front of
a bunch of strangers, and...

17:16.453 --> 17:18.329
I'm just not sure if I'm ready.

17:18.372 --> 17:19.830
Does that make sense?

17:19.873 --> 17:23.710
For you it does.
You always overthink things.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.753
Do you want to marry him or not?

17:25.796 --> 17:29.591
I don't know!
What if I make the wrong decision?

17:29.633 --> 17:32.678
Then great-- you'll know what
the right decision was!

17:32.719 --> 17:35.931
Sometimes you have to make bad decisions
in order to find your way.

17:35.973 --> 17:38.934
Like if I hadn't decided to go
on that trip with Miguel,

17:38.976 --> 17:41.645
I wouldn't have realized that I'd rather
be eaten alive by a bear

17:41.687 --> 17:43.230
than continue to be his girlfriend.

17:43.272 --> 17:46.859
I feel like no matter what I do,
someone will be disappointed.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.528
Then stop worrying about other people.

17:50.028 --> 17:53.490
Just make a choice and go for it.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.492
I have to go okay?

17:55.742 --> 17:56.827
Love you.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.375
Roberta-- we have a problem!

18:03.417 --> 18:05.043
Enjoy your tortillas!

18:05.544 --> 18:07.588
I think my mom is onto us!

18:07.629 --> 18:09.798
What are you talking about?!
I'm dating your brother.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.175
Well, "fake" dating.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.759
Oh, no. Does she know I'm
fake-dating your brother?!

18:12.801 --> 18:14.052
I don't know what she knows!

18:14.136 --> 18:16.763
Maybe she saw us
cuddling last night or something.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.975
Why'd she have to go and
get her stupid eyes fixed?!

18:21.810 --> 18:25.147
Tell me, Miss. Would you like
a kilo of tortillas? Half kilo?

18:26.023 --> 18:28.650
What are we going to do?! This could be
really bad-- for both of us!

18:28.692 --> 18:30.152
If my dad found out he'd kill me!

18:30.194 --> 18:33.572
Which is why you can't come to my
house anymore unless Máximo is there.

18:33.614 --> 18:36.658
We'll just have to find other ways
to see each other, like around here.

18:37.492 --> 18:40.204
And I'll take a kilo of tortillas, please.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.413
Here you go.

18:41.455 --> 18:44.124
Thank you so much, person I don't know.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.131
Memo!

18:52.424 --> 18:53.967
Okay, it took a little more
work than I thought,

18:54.009 --> 18:56.386
but I got you an interview with Héctor.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.013
But we have to go before
he changes his mind!

18:58.055 --> 18:59.556
That's great!

18:59.598 --> 19:02.184
But if I don't finish all the laundry,

19:02.226 --> 19:03.810
Lupe's going to fire me.
I have to stay here.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.854
The good news is...

19:05.896 --> 19:08.357
I'm almost finished!

19:09.024 --> 19:11.735
Sorry...

19:11.777 --> 19:14.655
I hadn't noticed this pile in the corner.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.532
This should be everything.

19:17.533 --> 19:20.702
Although, I haven't looked
in the other corners yet...

19:27.042 --> 19:28.585
Let's go.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.934
So, yeah, this is my kingdom, ladies.

19:43.934 --> 19:47.354
You can now call me Héctor,
the executive pool director.

19:48.939 --> 19:51.233
Excuse me. Some urgent pool business.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.195
Thank you so much
for meeting with me, Héctor.

19:55.279 --> 19:56.572
I just wanted to say--
-Name?

19:56.572 --> 19:57.823
I'm Memo Reyes,

19:57.823 --> 19:59.449
but you already--
-Work history.

19:59.533 --> 20:00.659
Is that really necessary?

20:00.659 --> 20:02.828
Are you asking the questions or am I?
-You are.

20:02.828 --> 20:04.496
Now, pay attention.
-Okay.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.624
You're taking orders from two different
chaise lounges at the same time,

20:07.708 --> 20:12.171
but a tray of food for three other chaises
is waiting for pickup at the bar.

20:12.171 --> 20:14.756
What is the minimum amount of time
you must allow yourself

20:14.840 --> 20:18.135
to finish taking the first order
before delivering the second order

20:18.135 --> 20:20.637
so that Mr. Randall's gazpacho
doesn't get cold?

20:20.721 --> 20:23.098
That's a trick question.
Gazpacho is already cold.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.934
Impressive.

20:26.018 --> 20:27.186
Now, without looking back,

20:27.186 --> 20:31.523
tell me every single thing you think
requires our attention behind us. Go.

20:31.607 --> 20:33.775
Easy. Three chaises are missing towels,

20:33.859 --> 20:36.570
two have drinks
that should be refilled immediately,

20:36.570 --> 20:39.072
and the woman in the gray bikini
was giving you the eye.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.241
So I think you might have a shot with her.

20:41.825 --> 20:45.078
That last one was too easy.
Of course I have a shot with her.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.414
Still...

20:48.207 --> 20:49.791
Not bad, eh?

20:51.627 --> 20:54.171
But I am going to have to meet
with some other candidates

20:54.171 --> 20:56.048
before I make my final decision.

20:57.508 --> 20:58.842
Good luck, <i>papi.</i>

21:04.097 --> 21:05.766
You're getting fired.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.769
And I'm gonna be working for him
for the rest of my life.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.565
Goodbye, Jacuzzi. Goodbye, perfect view.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.735
Goodbye, overdramatic
but always compelling pool singers.

21:36.421 --> 21:38.924
Hi.
-So, is now a bad time?

21:38.924 --> 21:40.884
'Cause I could come back--
-No, no. It's fine.

21:40.968 --> 21:42.261
I was trying to get a head start

21:42.261 --> 21:44.304
on the dresses your mom ordered
for the gift shop.

21:45.639 --> 21:49.059
Great.
So, I've been doing a lot of thinking,

21:49.059 --> 21:53.355
and I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry about last night.

21:53.355 --> 21:56.149
Okay, I got caught up trying to do
something big to impress you

21:56.233 --> 21:58.902
and make it feel special, and--
It was stupid.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.571
You thought you were stupid?

22:00.571 --> 22:02.114
Real stupid.

22:02.114 --> 22:04.825
And I never should have
put you on the spot like that.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.451
We've got a good thing going.

22:06.535 --> 22:09.329
And nothing says
we have to be engaged right now.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.290
You can take as much time as you need.

22:11.290 --> 22:14.585
Me and my fragile ego
are totally fine with that.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.504
Guess I'm pretty lucky
to have found you, huh?

22:17.588 --> 22:19.423
That's what I'm always saying,

22:20.132 --> 22:22.176
about you, not about me.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.429
But we are-- We're totally awesome.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.431
We are.

22:27.431 --> 22:29.474
Just two awesome people...

22:31.185 --> 22:33.687
who have a wedding to plan.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.566
Wait, does that mean...

22:40.152 --> 22:44.907
You're sure?
-Why not? Let's just go for it.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.953
I'm so excited. I'm gonna go tell my mom.

22:53.665 --> 22:54.666
Okay.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.261
Hi, Mom! I bought tortillas.

23:06.345 --> 23:08.722
I can help you make enfrijoladas
for dinner tonight!

23:08.764 --> 23:10.849
And I can go to the market
for you tomorrow.

23:10.933 --> 23:12.726
Or the pharmacy. Or the butcher.

23:12.768 --> 23:14.353
Whatever you need...

23:14.686 --> 23:16.772
...I want to help more.

23:22.152 --> 23:26.156
Oh, yeah. We're in real trouble.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.952
<i>Gentlemen, we are beginning
our descent into Acapulco.</i>

23:29.952 --> 23:31.787
Oh, wow. That was fast.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.164
Private's the only way to fly.

23:34.248 --> 23:36.708
Am I right, Joe?
-You sure are, boss.

23:36.792 --> 23:39.503
I don't know why everyone doesn't have
their own private plane.

23:42.047 --> 23:44.800
<i>It was time to release the baby turtles
into the ocean,</i>

23:44.800 --> 23:46.635
<i>and, as luck would have it,</i>

23:46.635 --> 23:49.596
<i>everyone I was trying to avoid was there,</i>

23:49.680 --> 23:51.348
<i>all in one place.</i>

23:57.563 --> 24:00.941
Everyone, please.
Everyone, gather 'round, please.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.484
Everyone, come closer.

24:03.694 --> 24:06.280
That's right, come up here. Gather 'round.

24:09.074 --> 24:12.786
Welcome to one of my favorite traditions
at Las Colinas.

24:12.870 --> 24:16.707
The annual releasing of the baby turtles.

24:16.707 --> 24:19.501
Beto, would you like to explain
how this all works?

24:21.503 --> 24:24.173
So, turtles lay their eggs in the sand.

24:24.173 --> 24:26.758
I know how you feel.

24:26.842 --> 24:30.053
We bury them on the beach.
Baby turtles hatch.

24:30.137 --> 24:33.473
And they keep them in my storeroom.
And I don't want them there.

24:33.557 --> 24:37.811
My hands smell like turtles.
Every drink I make smells like turtles.

24:38.395 --> 24:39.771
I hate this tradition.

24:43.025 --> 24:46.320
And now, on this glorious New Year's Day,

24:46.320 --> 24:51.867
we all get to release them into the ocean
to start their wondrous new lives.

24:51.867 --> 24:54.870
Just like how I felt
after I signed my first divorce papers.

24:57.247 --> 25:00.250
So, without further ado,

25:00.334 --> 25:06.507
everyone, release your turtles.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.010
Thank you, Beto.

25:50.926 --> 25:52.344
<i>At that moment,</i>

25:52.344 --> 25:55.889
<i>I couldn't help but feel like
I was that baby turtle, Hugo.</i>

25:57.015 --> 26:01.603
<i>Alone, struggling,
avoiding all that came in my path.</i>

26:02.271 --> 26:05.274
Hold on. Are you really comparing yourself
to a baby turtle?

26:06.441 --> 26:07.693
Why not?

26:07.693 --> 26:09.152
I'm freaking adorable.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.238
So just roll with it.

26:12.155 --> 26:16.118
<i>Because at that moment,
something miraculous was about to happen.</i>

26:16.118 --> 26:20.122
<i>Out of nowhere,
my turtle suddenly came alive.</i>

26:20.122 --> 26:25.460
<i>He wasn't going to let this beach,
this place, this moment in time beat him.</i>

26:26.920 --> 26:31.216
<i>Instead, he dove into the water headfirst.</i>

26:31.300 --> 26:35.971
<i>And I knew then that the time had come
for me to stop avoiding things too.</i>

26:37.514 --> 26:39.141
Enough messing with me, Héctor.

26:39.141 --> 26:40.851
What's it going to take
for Memo to get this job?

26:40.893 --> 26:42.769
Half your tips?

26:42.895 --> 26:43.729
Deal!

26:46.982 --> 26:49.860
Why would you agree to that?
You needed that money.

26:49.860 --> 26:52.487
It turns out I needed the win more.

26:52.571 --> 26:54.364
But don't worry, I wasn't done yet.

26:56.116 --> 26:57.242
Julia.

26:57.743 --> 27:00.204
I admit it. I was avoiding you earlier.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.498
It was a little weird
seeing you get engaged last night,

27:03.582 --> 27:06.502
but I totally support it.

27:06.502 --> 27:09.796
And I'm very happy for you and Chad.

27:10.756 --> 27:13.592
Okay. But are you sure you're not upset?

27:13.592 --> 27:15.177
Even after everything that--

27:15.177 --> 27:17.638
Please, that was 1984 us.

27:17.638 --> 27:19.264
But 1985 us,

27:19.765 --> 27:22.601
I think 1985 us are gonna be
very good friends.

27:23.185 --> 27:25.145
There he is! My "hermigo."

27:25.229 --> 27:28.148
Happy New Year, buddy.
-Happy New Year to you, Chad.

27:28.941 --> 27:30.901
And congratulations, you two.

27:30.901 --> 27:32.486
What a great couple.

27:34.488 --> 27:36.448
<i>None of that was easy to say.</i>

27:36.532 --> 27:39.785
<i>But at that moment,
it felt like the right thing to say.</i>

28:04.142 --> 28:07.145
We did it, Hugo. We're here.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.775
Welcome to Acapulco.

28:13.360 --> 28:18.198
We did it, Memo. We're here.
Welcome to our future.

28:18.282 --> 28:22.369
I can't believe it. We're actually
realizing our dream of working together.

28:23.287 --> 28:25.080
So, tell me, what did Héctor say?

28:25.664 --> 28:28.917
He just... recognizes talent
when he sees it.

28:29.543 --> 28:31.128
It is pretty undeniable.

28:31.670 --> 28:34.173
<i>Even though my day had turned a corner,</i>

28:34.173 --> 28:37.885
<i>there was still one more issue from 1984
I needed to face.</i>

28:38.552 --> 28:40.137
<i>My fight with Don Pablo.</i>

28:40.137 --> 28:41.513
I'll be right back.

28:44.933 --> 28:47.311
Memo Reyes, pool boy.

28:50.981 --> 28:52.107
Don Pablo.

28:53.483 --> 28:54.651
Máximo.

29:06.622 --> 29:10.667
I'm very sorry for the way I talked to you
last night. It was not appropriate.

29:10.751 --> 29:14.713
Forget about last night.
Because of you and your mother,

29:14.755 --> 29:18.175
my son and grandson are back in my life!

29:18.217 --> 29:20.177
I can never thank you enough.

29:21.512 --> 29:25.474
I know you're upset you didn't get
that promotion. Head pool boy--

29:26.683 --> 29:29.019
- that was a nice dream to have.

29:29.061 --> 29:33.065
I guess not all my dreams can come true.

29:33.524 --> 29:37.277
Or maybe... you just need to dream bigger.

29:39.029 --> 29:39.863
Look...

29:39.988 --> 29:42.741
If you really want to advance
at the resort,

29:43.158 --> 29:47.663
you have to get closer
to the center of power.

29:47.704 --> 29:50.666
And, like it or not,

29:50.707 --> 29:51.834
that's Diane.

29:51.875 --> 29:55.712
Do I have to get close to Diane
the way Héctor got close to Diane?

29:55.963 --> 30:00.717
No, Héctor found a shortcut.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.973
Trust me, it won't last.

30:06.014 --> 30:09.351
No, I want to make you
indispensable to Diane.

30:09.393 --> 30:11.812
If right now I'm her right hand

30:12.646 --> 30:15.315
by the summer,
you're going to be her left hand.

30:16.275 --> 30:19.403
And how are we going to do this?

30:22.823 --> 30:26.785
Is that a magical key?
Does it lead to another world?

30:26.827 --> 30:29.079
Yes. A secret world also known as...

30:29.121 --> 30:31.248
the service pantry.

30:33.125 --> 30:36.211
Every morning, Diane expects a hot coffee

30:36.295 --> 30:38.463
and a newspaper to be waiting
outside her office.

30:38.839 --> 30:41.383
Starting tomorrow, that's your job.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.427
That's phase one.

30:43.927 --> 30:46.430
After that, anything's possible.

30:47.931 --> 30:49.224
How does that sound?

30:49.308 --> 30:52.644
Like 1985 is off to a very good start.

30:55.856 --> 30:58.275
Of course!
That's what a bartender is for right?

30:58.317 --> 30:59.735
To pick up trash?

30:59.776 --> 31:02.654
Who told me to go around
wanting to serve drinks anyways...
