07:26.933 --> 07:28.367
YOU KNOW LEO,
HIS FATHER ?

07:28.400 --> 07:29.300
YEAH.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.267
WE LOST HIM YESTERDAY.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.700
HODGKIN'S,
REAL BAD.

07:33.733 --> 07:34.800
OH.

07:34.833 --> 07:38.867
I THOUGHT HE HAD
THE GOOD HODGKIN'S.

07:38.900 --> 07:39.600
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS GOOD HODGKIN'S.

07:39.633 --> 07:40.533
YES, THERE IS.

07:40.567 --> 07:41.433
HOW DO YOU KNOW,
WHAT'S YOUR PROOF ?

07:41.467 --> 07:42.500
WHAT ARE YOU
A SCIENTIFIC...

07:42.533 --> 07:44.567
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
HOW I KNOW, OKAY ?

07:44.600 --> 07:45.900
'CAUSE I USED TO
WATCH PARTY OF FIVE...

07:45.933 --> 07:47.833
PARTY OF FIVE,
RIGHT THERE.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.600
CHARLIE, THE ORPHAN SON,
THE OLDEST ONE.

07:50.633 --> 07:51.733
HE HAD GOOD HODGKIN'S.

07:51.767 --> 07:53.867
I WOULDN'T BE GOING AROUND
QUOTING GOOD HODGKIN'S

07:53.900 --> 07:55.100
BASED ON
PARTY OF FIVE.

07:55.133 --> 07:56.500
JUST ME.

07:56.533 --> 07:57.967
OKAY, FINE.

07:58.067 --> 08:00.067
( Jeff )
HALF OFF.

08:00.067 --> 08:01.067
REALLY ?
HALF OFF, WHAT A DEAL.

08:01.067 --> 08:04.067
HERE YOU GO, GUYS.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.500
YOU GUYS GOT
A NICE DAY.

08:05.533 --> 08:06.900
THANK YOU, SVEN.

08:06.933 --> 08:08.200
YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:08.233 --> 08:09.900
ALRIGHT,
WHAT IS THAT ?

08:09.933 --> 08:11.333
IS THAT SWEDISH,
SVEN ?

08:11.367 --> 08:13.200
IT'S NORWEGIAN.

08:13.233 --> 08:18.967
I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT
SVEN WAS A SWEDISH NAME.

08:19.067 --> 08:19.967
IT'S NOT.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.533
SO I DON'T LOOK
SWEDISH, DO I ?

08:21.567 --> 08:23.433
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

08:23.467 --> 08:24.700
APPARENTLY.

08:24.733 --> 08:26.067
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE,
MAY I ASK ?

08:26.067 --> 08:29.833
CULTURE, LOOKS, NAMES,
HISTORY, FOOD, DANCING.

08:29.867 --> 08:33.233
OKAY, OKAY, SORRY,
HONEST MISTAKE.

08:33.267 --> 08:36.967
ARE SWEDES TOUCHY IF YOU
REFER TO THEM AS NORWEGIANS ?

08:37.067 --> 08:37.967
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK A SWEDE ?

08:38.067 --> 08:40.167
YEAH, MAYBE I WILL.

08:42.967 --> 08:43.800
HEY.

08:43.833 --> 08:44.767
HEY.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.200
HEY, FANCY-PANTS.

08:46.233 --> 08:48.233
OH YEAH, I GOTTA
GO TO A FUNERAL.

08:48.267 --> 08:49.700
UH, OH, I'M SORRY.

08:49.733 --> 08:51.467
YEAH, AH,
IT'S A GUY I KNEW.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.100
ARE YOU OKAY
TO MOVE AND STUFF ?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.433
YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.267
HEY, SO I WAS IN THIS
GROCERY STORE A FEW DAYS AGO.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.567
YEAH ?

08:57.600 --> 09:01.067
AND, UH, I SAW A BAG OF
YOUR DAD'S CASHEW-RAISINS.

09:01.067 --> 09:03.067
OH, GOOD, GOOD,
DID YOU GET IT ?

09:03.100 --> 09:03.733
YEAH.

09:03.767 --> 09:05.533
IT'S KIND OF, UH...

09:05.567 --> 09:08.433
IT'S KIND OF SKIMPING ON
THE CASHEWS A LITTLE BIT.

09:08.467 --> 09:10.100
UH, WHAT DO
YOU MEAN ?

09:10.133 --> 09:13.467
WELL, THERE'S LIKE FOUR CASHEWS
IN A WHOLE BAG, YOU KNOW ?

09:13.500 --> 09:14.800
UM...

09:14.833 --> 09:16.500
HERE LOOK,
I'LL SHOW YOU.

09:16.533 --> 09:18.800
SEE ?

09:18.833 --> 09:21.600
WOW, YOU, YOU SAVED
A BAG TO SHOW ME.

09:21.633 --> 09:22.933
NO, I DIDN'T SAVE IT.

09:22.967 --> 09:25.067
I'M GOING TO THE FUNERAL,
I NEED A SNACK, ACTUALLY.

09:25.067 --> 09:27.133
I MEAN, THEY'RE VERY GOOD,
THEY'RE DELICIOUS CASHEWS,

09:27.167 --> 09:28.433
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WOULD IT KILL HIM

09:28.467 --> 09:29.267
TO PUT THREE MORE
CASHEWS IN THERE ?

09:29.300 --> 09:30.400
I THINK, YOU KNOW
WHAT IT IS ?

09:30.433 --> 09:33.067
I MEAN, THE CASHEWS
ARE EXPENSIVE, FIRST OF ALL,

09:33.067 --> 09:37.900
UM, THERE'S A SHORTAGE
RIGHT NOW.

09:37.933 --> 09:41.800
YES, IT'S FOR
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, UM...

09:41.833 --> 09:42.933
I NEVER READ ABOUT
A CASHEW SHORTAGE.

09:42.967 --> 09:45.167
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT IN THE INDUSTRY.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.533
CAN I GIVE HIM A LITTLE
PIECE OF ADVICE ?

09:46.567 --> 09:47.600
PLEASE.

09:47.633 --> 09:50.833
I WOULD CALL IT RAISINS.

09:50.867 --> 09:54.300
AND THEN LET PEOPLE BE
SURPRISED BY THE CASHEWS.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.600
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS,
ARE YOU ?

09:56.633 --> 09:57.767
I AM, YEAH.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.267
IT'S BETTER THAN
BEING DISAPPOINTED

09:59.300 --> 10:01.633
BY BUYING SOMETHING
CALLED CASHEW-RAISINS.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.067
WE COULD PUT MORE IN THERE, BUT
THEY'D CHARGE YOU A LOT MORE.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.133
THAT'S THE BALANCE.

10:05.167 --> 10:07.200
WE WANTED TO MAKE AN
AFFORDABLE SNACK, LARRY.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.633
AN AFFORDABLE SNACK.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.200
GIVE ME THREE MORE
CASHEWS IN HERE.

10:10.233 --> 10:11.633
I'LL BE A HAPPY MAN.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.033
THEN I THINK YOU GOT
THE RIGHT RATIO, THAT'S ALL.

10:14.067 --> 10:16.233
NO BIG DEAL.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.567
SHOULD WE JUST,
REHEARSE ?

10:18.600 --> 10:20.600
CAN WE GET STARTED ?

10:23.033 --> 10:24.567
HEY.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.833
HEY.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.567
LOOK AT THIS.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.667
LETTER FROM THE CLUB.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.200
I DIDN'T GET ONE.

10:32.233 --> 10:33.400
HAVING A DIRTY LOCKER.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.733
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

10:35.767 --> 10:37.833
IF I DON'T CLEAN IT,
THEY'RE GONNA SUSPEND ME.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.667
BELIEVE THIS
BULLSHIT ?

10:39.700 --> 10:41.833
WOW, HOW DO YOU THINK
THEY FOUND OUT ?

10:41.867 --> 10:43.167
NORM.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.900
NORM, WHY WOULD HE
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

10:44.933 --> 10:46.067
HE HATES ME.

10:46.100 --> 10:46.933
HE HATES YOU, HUH ?

10:46.967 --> 10:48.233
HE HATES ME.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.667
WOW, THAT'S A HORRIBLE
THING TO DO.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.633
TERRIBLE, YEAH.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.467
WHAT DO YOU EAT
THOSE THINGS FOR ?

10:55.500 --> 10:56.767
WHAT, HEALTH-GLO.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.633
THERE'S NO CASHEWS IN THERE,
I LOVE CASHEWS.

10:58.667 --> 10:59.700
THEY PUT NO CASHEWS
IN THERE.

10:59.733 --> 11:00.967
YEAH, YOU KNOW
WHO MAKES IT ?

11:01.067 --> 11:01.567
WHO ?

11:01.600 --> 11:02.567
SCHWIMMER'S FATHER.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.833
SWEAR TO GOD.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

11:03.867 --> 11:05.900
WOW, YOU OUGHT TO TELL HIM
TO ADD MORE CASHEWS.

11:05.933 --> 11:06.933
GUESS WHAT, I DID.

11:06.967 --> 11:07.900
REALLY ?

11:07.933 --> 11:09.567
WOW, GREAT, GREAT.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.467
( Jeff )
HEY, NORM.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.600
UH, SHALOM, JEFF.

11:11.633 --> 11:12.300
HEY, NORM.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.200
YEAH ?

11:14.233 --> 11:16.433
CARE FOR SOME, UH,
CASHEW-RAISINS ?

11:16.467 --> 11:19.067
NO, I HAVE
NO APPETITE.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.733
HEY, NORM, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

11:22.767 --> 11:28.267
I GOT A LETTER FROM THE CLUB
ABOUT HAVING A DIRTY LOCKER.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.233
THEY DON'T LIKE
DIRTY LOCKERS.

11:30.267 --> 11:31.067
YEAH.

11:31.067 --> 11:32.233
YOU REMEMBER
BURT SUZUKI ?

11:32.267 --> 11:33.300
YEAH.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.433
THEY KICKED HIM OUT
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

11:35.467 --> 11:37.067
FILTHY LOCKER,
FILTHY.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.267
YEAH, I WAS JUST
KIND OF WONDERING,

11:38.300 --> 11:41.567
MAYBE, IF YOU HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT ?

11:41.600 --> 11:42.433
ME ?

11:42.467 --> 11:43.300
YEAH.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.600
NO.

11:45.633 --> 11:47.633
YOU SURE ?

11:47.667 --> 11:50.067
YEAH.

12:10.167 --> 12:13.233
( piano music )

12:17.767 --> 12:19.067
I'M VERY SORRY.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.067
THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.833
VERY SORRY.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.767
VERY SORRY.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.367
HI LARRY.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.167
SORRY ABOUT
YOUR UNCLE.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.733
THANK YOU,
VERY MUCH.

12:27.767 --> 12:29.367
VERY SORRY.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.167
VERY SORRY.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.767
SORRY ABOUT
YOUR DAD.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.200
THANKS, LARRY.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.667
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.967
HE WAS A GREAT MAN.

12:40.067 --> 12:44.100
MAYBE WE'LL PLAY GOLF SOME TIME,
WHEN YOU'RE, FEEL BETTER.

12:44.133 --> 12:49.067
FEEL UP TO IT.

12:49.067 --> 12:53.267
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THAT
WEATHERMAN'S TIP, YOU KNOW ?

12:53.300 --> 12:55.700
RIGHT NOW,
I'M IN MOURNING.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.300
NO, I'M NOT SAYING NOW,
BUT SOME OTHER TIME, YOU KNOW.

12:58.333 --> 13:02.633
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT,
DO IT, WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.533
WHAT'S WITH
THE OPEN CASKET ?

13:07.567 --> 13:09.200
YEAH, WHY DO WE HAVE
TO GO LOOK AT THAT.

13:09.233 --> 13:12.067
HEY, JEFF ROSENTHAL.

13:12.067 --> 13:13.700
HE WAS A WRITER
ON PARTY OF FIVE.

13:13.733 --> 13:14.633
THAT GUY, REALLY ?

13:14.667 --> 13:15.533
YEAH.

13:15.567 --> 13:16.633
GO ASK HIM.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.600
EXCUSE ME.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.767
I'M SORRY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND ?

13:21.800 --> 13:22.900
SURE.

13:22.933 --> 13:25.067
UM, THIS IS GONNA
SOUND A LITTLE CRAZY,

13:25.067 --> 13:26.833
WAIT, DID YOU WORK
ON PARTY OF FIVE ?

13:26.867 --> 13:28.067
YEAH.

13:28.067 --> 13:30.867
YOU REMEMBER THE SEASON
WHEN CHARLIE HAD HODGKIN'S ?

13:30.900 --> 13:32.333
RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH.

13:32.367 --> 13:36.433
YEAH, OKAY, SO IN THE SHOW
DIDN'T HE HAVE GOOD HODGKIN'S ?

13:36.467 --> 13:40.967
WELL, HE HAD HODGKIN'S
THAT HE SURVIVED, I MEAN,

13:41.067 --> 13:42.167
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S GOOD,

13:42.200 --> 13:44.167
BUT HE SURVIVED IT
SO THAT WAS GOOD.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.233
BUT ISN'T THERE A GOOD HODGKIN'S
AND A BAD HODGKIN'S ?

13:46.267 --> 13:50.933
NO, THERE'S HODGKIN'S
AND NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA.

13:50.967 --> 13:54.067
AND HODGKIN'S DISEASE
HAS A BETTER SURVIVAL RATE.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.633
OKAY, SO THAT'S
A BETTER HODGKIN'S.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.833
I MEAN,
THAT'S A VALID POINT,

13:58.867 --> 14:01.467
BUT I WOULDN'T SAY
IT WAS GOOD.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.267
IT'S BETTER.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.733
IT'S BETTER.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.267
OKAY.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.767
BUT NOT GOOD.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.633
BETTER.

14:12.533 --> 14:14.067
OKAY, THERE'S TWO
KINDS OF HODGKIN'S,

14:14.067 --> 14:16.067
ONE HAS A BETTER SURVIVAL RATE
THAN THE OTHER.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.533
RIGHT.

14:17.567 --> 14:19.067
OKAY,
SO IT'S GOOD.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.100
NO, IT'S NOT GOOD.

14:21.133 --> 14:22.300
WELL, IT'S BETTER
THAN THE OTHER.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.867
OKAY, BETTER,
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.833
WELL, COMPARED TO
THE OTHER IT'S GOOD.

14:41.733 --> 14:42.533
WHAT ?

14:42.567 --> 14:43.700
MY 5-WOOD'S IN THERE.

14:43.733 --> 14:44.633
WHAT ?

14:44.667 --> 14:47.133
GO SEE FOR YOURSELF,
IT'S MY 5-WOOD.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.833
OH MY GOD.

14:51.867 --> 14:54.233
THE FUCK IS MY 5-WOOD
DOING IN THE CASKET ?

14:54.267 --> 14:55.767
I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.600
WELL, HE'D PROBABLY WANTED
BE BURY WITH HIS GOLF CLUB.

14:58.633 --> 14:59.867
YEAH ?

14:59.900 --> 15:03.467
SVEN MUST HAVE PUT MY CLUB
IN THERE, PROBABLY ON PURPOSE.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.767
THAT'S A HORRIBLE
THING TO DO.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.267
THAT CLUB'S
IRREPLACEABLE.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.867
IT'S 10 YEARS OLD,
THEY DON'T MAKE IT ANYMORE.

15:07.900 --> 15:08.867
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.600
I'M SORRY, MAN.

15:11.633 --> 15:15.567
YOU GOT YOUR CLUBS
IN YOUR TRUNK ?

15:15.600 --> 15:17.800
YEAH.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.567
NO, NOT, NO, NO, NO.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.600
WHY ?

15:20.633 --> 15:22.300
BECAUSE I LIKE
THE WAY MINE FEELS.

15:22.333 --> 15:24.767
YOUR CLUB, I CAN GET AT
ANY STORE IN THE COUNTRY.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.100
BUT I LIKE THE FEEL.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.233
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
IT'S ONE CLUB.

15:27.267 --> 15:28.500
I LIKE THAT CLUB.

15:28.533 --> 15:31.067
WHY SHOULD THIS GUY BE BURIED
IN ETERNITY WITH MY CLUB ?

15:31.067 --> 15:31.833
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

15:31.867 --> 15:34.633
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.567
I'LL BUY YOU A NEW CLUB TODAY,
THE EXACT SAME...

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
THE EXACT SAME ONE.

15:37.633 --> 15:47.667
AND IT BETTER
HAVE THE SAME FEEL.

15:47.667 --> 15:57.667
AND IT BETTER
HAVE THE SAME FEEL.

16:48.167 --> 16:52.400
MY UNCLE LEO WAS
MORE THAN MY UNCLE,

16:52.433 --> 16:54.067
HE WAS LIKE A SECOND
FATHER TO ME.

16:54.067 --> 16:58.067
AND LOVED LIFE,
MY UNCLE LEO, DIDN'T HE ?

16:58.067 --> 17:01.800
HE WAS A GUY WHO
LIVED IT TO THE HILT.

17:01.833 --> 17:05.933
LOVED HIS ONLY SON,
MARTY.

17:05.967 --> 17:07.733
HE LOVED A GOOD WALK.

17:07.767 --> 17:09.933
LOVED GINGER-ALE...

17:09.967 --> 17:11.700

DRIVING HIS CAR.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.800
HATED TO FLY.

17:15.833 --> 17:16.900

17:21.067 --> 17:22.867
JEOPARDY, THOSE OF YOU

17:22.900 --> 17:27.800
DISGUSTING.
HE LOVED TO FRAME THE ANSWERS
LIKE QUESTIONS, HUH ?

17:27.833 --> 17:33.067
EVERY SECOND TUESDAY,
A HAIRCUT.

17:33.067 --> 17:36.967
I'M JUST GONNA SAY GOODBYE
TO MY UNCLE LEO.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.667
MARTY, COME HERE

17:46.467 --> 17:49.667
IS THIS
HIS 5-WOOD ?

17:53.200 --> 17:56.267
NO, SOMEONE MUST
HAVE SWITCHED IT.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.933
( crowd gasping )

17:58.967 --> 18:02.667
WHAT IS THAT ?

18:02.700 --> 18:04.300
IS THAT A CASHEW ?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.267
YEAH, IT'S A CASHEW.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.067

18:30.867 --> 18:33.600
( Susie )
WE ARE KICKED OUT
OF OUR COUNTRY CLUB

18:33.633 --> 18:36.067
BECAUSE OF
A FUCKING 5-IRON ?

18:36.067 --> 18:37.800
IT WAS A 5-WOOD.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.133
JEFFREY ?

18:39.167 --> 18:41.100
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE GOLF-CLUB
HAD YOUR NAME ON IT ?

18:41.133 --> 18:42.333
FUCKING IDIOT.

18:42.367 --> 18:45.300
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW, ALRIGHT ?

18:45.333 --> 18:47.067
WHERE'S CHERYL
GONNA PLAY TENNIS ?

18:47.067 --> 18:50.767
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
WHERE AM I GONNA PLAY TENNIS ?

18:50.800 --> 18:52.733
I'VE BEEN PLAYING TENNIS
AT THAT CLUB FOR YEARS.

18:52.767 --> 18:54.067
SHE'S IN
THE TOURNAMENTS,

18:54.067 --> 18:55.667
SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST
TENNIS PLAYERS IN THE CLUB.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.067
SHE'S NOT THAT GREAT,
BY THE WAY.

18:57.067 --> 18:59.467
NO, AS A MATTER OF FACT I AM AND
I THINK I PROVED THAT, OKAY ?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.900
I BEAT HER
6-ONE, 6-LOVE.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.433
TWO YEARS AGO.

19:03.467 --> 19:04.667
TWO YEARS AGO ?

19:04.700 --> 19:06.400
AND YOUR STILL
HANGING ONTO THAT.

19:06.433 --> 19:08.267
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE PLAYED TENNIS SINCE THEN,

19:08.300 --> 19:09.133
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

19:09.167 --> 19:10.533

19:10.567 --> 19:13.100
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS
CHERYL CARES ABOUT THAT CLUB,

19:13.133 --> 19:15.800
I CARE ABOUT THAT CLUB,
SAMMY GOES TO DAY-CAMP THERE

19:15.833 --> 19:17.600
WITH THE SAME KIDS
SHE'S BEEN WITH FOR YEARS,

19:17.633 --> 19:20.067
AND YOU TWO DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.167
YOU'RE A FUCKING
NARCISSIST, OKAY ?

19:22.200 --> 19:25.233
IT'S ALL A GAME,
ALL A BIG FUCKING GAME.

19:25.267 --> 19:26.300
WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO ?

19:26.333 --> 19:28.167
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU'RE JUST SO INCONSIDERATE,

19:28.200 --> 19:30.600
YOU DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN NEXT, DO YOU ?

19:30.633 --> 19:32.733
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT 5-WOOD
WAS IRREPLACEABLE, OKAY ?

19:32.767 --> 19:33.733
MINE'S REPLACEABLE.

19:33.767 --> 19:34.933
YEAH, AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

19:34.967 --> 19:36.333
I WOULD RATHER BE
OUT OF THAT CLUB,

19:36.367 --> 19:38.067
WITH MY 5-WOOD,
THEN IN IT WITHOUT IT.

19:38.100 --> 19:41.167
WELL, WE WOULD RATHER
YOU BE IN IT WITHOUT IT.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.500
WE'VE NO PLACE TO GO,
NO PLACE TO PLAY.

19:43.533 --> 19:45.333
IT WAS OUR
SOCIAL LIFE !

19:45.367 --> 19:47.633
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

19:47.667 --> 19:49.733
I THINK MY FRIEND JULIE
WAS JUST SAYING THAT

19:49.767 --> 19:51.833
THE BEVERLY PARK COUNTRY CLUB
MIGHT BE TAKING NEW MEMBERS.

19:51.867 --> 19:54.300
GOOD COURSE,
IT'S PRETTY.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.500
AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
COUNTRY CLUB.

19:56.533 --> 19:58.600
ALRIGHT, LOOK, I DON'T
WANT TO OFFEND YOU,

19:58.633 --> 20:01.467
BUT THERE'S, LIKE, THREE FUCKING
JEWS IN THE WHOLE CLUB, OKAY ?

20:01.500 --> 20:04.100
IT'S NOT FOR US, IT'S WASP,
WASP, REPUBLICAN CITY.

20:04.133 --> 20:05.100
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

20:05.133 --> 20:07.267
I FIT IN WITH YOU
GUYS ALL THE TIME,

20:07.300 --> 20:09.633
FOR YEARS, I'VE BEEN
GOING TO YOUR THING, SO.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.367
HOW AM I GONNA EVEN
GET BY IN THE INTERVIEW ?

20:11.400 --> 20:13.767
THIS ONE WOULD STICK OUT
LIKE A SORE FUCKING THUMB,

20:13.800 --> 20:15.100
THIS JEW-FACE

20:15.133 --> 20:16.867
OH, I'M MORE OF
A JEW-FACE THAN YOU ?

20:16.900 --> 20:18.000
HEY FUCK YOU, LARRY,

20:18.033 --> 20:19.900
OKAY, I DIDN'T GET US
INTO THIS PREDICAMENT.

20:19.933 --> 20:21.967
I'M MUCH MORE GENTILE
THAN YOU ARE.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.067
OKAY, OKAY, LOOK.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.900
WE GET AN INTERVIEW,
WE GO IN THERE.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.133
IT'S A GREAT
GOLF COURSE.

20:26.167 --> 20:28.433
IT IS, AND THEY HAVE
BEAUTIFUL TENNIS COURTS.

20:28.467 --> 20:29.600
OH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.433
YOU HAVE TO WALK ON THAT COURSE,
THERE'S NO CARTS,

20:32.467 --> 20:32.967
WE LIKE, YEAH,
WE LIKE TO TAKE A CART.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.600
I'M NOT JOINING.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.233
IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU
TO WALK A LITTLE JEFF.

20:36.267 --> 20:37.467
SO YOU GET YOUR EXERCISE
WHEN YOU GO GOLFING,

20:37.500 --> 20:38.600
THAT'S WHAT
IT'S ALL ABOUT.

20:38.633 --> 20:40.133
YOU CAN'T EXERCISE
A LITTLE BIT ?

20:40.167 --> 20:42.400
I'D HAVE TO GET A DOCTOR'S NOTE
IN ORDER TO TAKE A CART.

20:42.433 --> 20:43.533
SO GET A FUCKING
DOCTOR'S NOTE !

20:43.567 --> 20:45.233
I DON'T KNOW
ANY DOCTOR.

20:45.267 --> 20:47.633
OH, IT'S ALWAYS
SOMETHING WITH THEM.

20:55.067 --> 20:56.567

21:08.967 --> 21:11.633
YEAH.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.233
( growling )

21:18.267 --> 21:20.900

21:26.833 --> 21:29.600
THE DOG BIT
MY PENIS !

21:37.867 --> 21:42.667
FUCKING DOG SHOULD
BE PUT TO SLEEP.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.167
( Cheryl )
HE SHOULD BE
PUT TO SLEEP.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.367
YOU THINK SO TOO ?

21:45.400 --> 21:47.167
IT'S BITING PEOPLE,
JEFF, THAT'S DANGEROUS.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.767
HE'S NEVER BITTEN
ANYBODY BEFORE, EVER.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.433
HEY, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
WITH YOU AND THE DOG,

21:50.467 --> 21:51.333
I KNOW THAT.

21:51.367 --> 21:52.700
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?

21:52.733 --> 21:54.667
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE DOG ?

21:54.700 --> 21:56.467
TELL HER.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.167
NOTHING HAPPENED
WITH THE DOG.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.700
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
SOMETHING HAPPENED,

21:59.733 --> 22:01.667
'CAUSE HE JUST SAID
IT'S NOT THE FIRST INCIDENT,
WHAT HAPPENED ?

22:01.700 --> 22:03.367
HE PET THE DOG BEFORE.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.100
DOG WAS IN HIS LAP,
HE GOT UP, HE HAD A BONER.

22:06.133 --> 22:10.733
WHY DID THE DOG
GIVE YOU AN ERECTION ?

22:10.767 --> 22:12.833
OKAY, AND WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THAT ?

22:12.867 --> 22:15.833
FIRST OF ALL,
THAT'S NOT TRUE, OKAY ?

22:15.867 --> 22:16.833
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

22:16.867 --> 22:17.700
I WAS PETTING THE...

22:17.733 --> 22:18.667
WHY WOULD
HE SAY THAT ?

22:18.700 --> 22:20.300
BECAUSE HE'S A MORON,
BECAUSE HE'S...

22:20.333 --> 22:22.067
I'M MAKING IT UP FROM
THIN AIR, WHAT HAPPENED ?

22:22.067 --> 22:23.767
I WAS PETTING THE DOG,

22:23.800 --> 22:26.067
AND THEN THE DOG LEFT AND I
GOT UP AND I ADJUSTED MY PANTS.

22:26.100 --> 22:27.067
YOU KNOW NOT, NOT--

22:27.067 --> 22:28.267
BECAUSE YOU HAD
AN ERECTION ?

22:28.300 --> 22:30.067
NO, BECAUSE I JUST HAD TO
ADJUST MY PANTS, THAT'S ALL.

22:30.067 --> 22:30.867
AND THEN
SUSIE SAW ME.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.333
WHAT WAS THE DOG
DOING TO YOU ?

22:32.367 --> 22:33.933
NOTHING, I WAS
JUST PETTING IT.

22:33.967 --> 22:35.433
YOU SEE
WHAT YOU DID ?

22:35.467 --> 22:37.100
YOU SEE WHAT
YOU DID NOW ?

22:37.133 --> 22:38.233
OH MY GOD, WAIT A SECOND,
WAIT A SECOND.

22:38.267 --> 22:39.967
IS THAT WHY TED DANSON
DIDN'T WANT YOU

22:40.067 --> 22:41.100
TO TAKE CARE
OF HIS DOG ?

22:41.133 --> 22:43.400
MMM-HMM.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.733
OH, GOD, I'M SO SORRY
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.900
IT'S PRIVACY HERE.

22:50.933 --> 22:54.367
OKAY, LET ME SEE,
I JUST GOT THIS,

22:54.400 --> 22:55.800
I'M SORRY, I HAVEN'T
REALLY LOOKED AT IT.

22:55.833 --> 22:59.233

23:34.133 --> 23:36.267
A DOG BIT
YOUR PENIS ?

23:36.300 --> 23:41.167

FASCINATING.

25:22.300 --> 25:24.800

ABOUT THE GLOBAL-WARMING.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.633

25:43.267 --> 25:44.600
WELL, I WOULD
CALL IT MAY-OCTOBER,

25:44.633 --> 25:46.200

WHAT DO YOU
DO AFTERWARDS ?

26:10.800 --> 26:12.200
RIGHT.

26:12.233 --> 26:15.333
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER THAT ?

26:15.367 --> 26:16.733

26:21.367 --> 26:23.333
MAGNIFICENT, REALLY,
JUST MAGNIFICENT.

26:23.367 --> 26:26.300
YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE HERE ?

26:26.333 --> 26:28.833
OH, SO AT HOME.

26:28.867 --> 26:30.067
QUITE COMFORTABLE.

26:30.100 --> 26:32.867
LET ME SAY THE GOLF COURSE
IS MAGNIFICENT TOO,

26:32.900 --> 26:34.500
YOU KNOW, I'M FAIRLY
NEW TO GOLF.

26:34.533 --> 26:37.667
UM, POLO WAS
MY GAME.

26:37.700 --> 26:38.733
REALLY ?

26:38.767 --> 26:40.800
OH, WHEN I HAD
A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT,

26:40.833 --> 26:42.300
I GOT HIT WITH
A MALLET IN THE HEAD AND,

26:42.333 --> 26:44.467
UH, FELL OFF THE HORSE,
AND, UH, UNFORTUNATELY I,

26:44.500 --> 26:45.800
MY POLO DAYS
WERE OVER,

26:45.833 --> 26:48.667
BUT I FOUND THE SWING
REALLY WORKS FOR GOLF, IT'S...

26:48.700 --> 26:50.400
YES, HE'S A NATURAL.

26:50.433 --> 26:51.767
I PICKED IT UP
RIGHT AWAY.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.367
YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT
IT IS A SIMILAR SWING.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.967
THINK ABOUT IT, YEAH.

26:55.067 --> 26:57.167
RIGHT.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.267
BY THE WAY,
DID I NOTICE A, UH,

27:00.300 --> 27:03.067
LOG-CABIN REPUBLICAN
IN THE PARKING LOT ?

27:03.067 --> 27:04.200

27:04.233 --> 27:05.400
DID YOU LET
THAT ONE IN, KEN ?

27:05.433 --> 27:07.900
( laughing )

27:07.933 --> 27:09.800
OKAY.

27:09.833 --> 27:10.733
I THOUGHT WE DID.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.067
LET ME ASK
YOU A QUESTION.

27:12.100 --> 27:15.400
WHAT HOBBIES OR SOCIAL SOCIETIES
HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN ?

27:15.433 --> 27:16.500
MM, THAT'S
A FAIR QUESTION.

27:16.533 --> 27:18.133
OUTSIDE OF GOLF
OF COURSE.

27:18.167 --> 27:19.467
WE LIKE SAILING, UH...

27:19.500 --> 27:21.633
YES, WE SAIL
AS A PAIR.

27:21.667 --> 27:24.933
GOT A, UH, SCHOONER
DOWN AT THE MARINA.

27:24.967 --> 27:27.067
A SCHOONER IN THE MARINA,
WELL, THAT'S MARVELOUS,

27:27.067 --> 27:28.433
YOU MUST KNOW
BAXTER CHURCHILL ?

27:28.467 --> 27:29.767
OF COURSE.

27:29.800 --> 27:30.933
YES, YES.

27:30.967 --> 27:34.067
DO YOU SAIL IT YOURSELF
OR DO YOU HAVE A CAPTAIN ?

27:34.067 --> 27:38.200
OCCASIONALLY I'LL BRING
A CAPTAIN IN IF IT'S WINDY.

27:38.233 --> 27:39.800
COULD I ASK YOU A FEW
MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT,

27:39.833 --> 27:42.400
UH, ORGANIZATIONS
THAT YOU BELONG TO ?

27:42.433 --> 27:44.133
ABSOLUTELY.

27:44.167 --> 27:48.667
WELL, I'M A MOOSE...
AND AN ELK.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.667
YOU'RE A MOOSE
AND AN ELK ?

27:49.700 --> 27:51.100
I'M A MOOSE AND
AN ELK, YES, YEAH.

27:51.133 --> 27:52.100
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

27:52.133 --> 27:54.300

THE ROTARY CLUB.

27:54.333 --> 27:57.200
WELL, OH MY.

UH, RATHER WELL.

28:08.567 --> 28:10.233
PROCEEDINGS HAVE
COME TO AN END.

28:10.267 --> 28:11.200
