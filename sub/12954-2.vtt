WEBVTT

00:01.141 --> 00:03.291
For starters, my name isn't Michael Vaughn.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.939
Langley believes Vaughn may be a double agent.

00:08.578 --> 00:11.028
They think the crash may have been an extraction.

00:11.079 --> 00:13.429
Gordon Dean, Office of Special Investigations.

00:13.643 --> 00:15.043
My fiance was just abducted.

00:15.269 --> 00:17.619
Perhaps. That's what we're trying to determine.

00:17.704 --> 00:18.704
I want the truth.

00:18.758 --> 00:20.458
Seven years ago, a woman came to me,

00:20.505 --> 00:22.701
said that her father had been involved in a project,

00:22.702 --> 00:25.143
something that people had gone to great lengths to cover up.

00:25.144 --> 00:26.460
Said it was called Prophet Five.

00:26.488 --> 00:29.841
This man we're meeting, Renée and I have been trying to find him for years.

00:29.887 --> 00:31.230
Renée who? Who is this woman?

00:31.267 --> 00:32.517
- Renée Rienne.
- Vaughn.

00:33.330 --> 00:34.530
The Raven, Renée Rienne.

00:35.204 --> 00:38.954
She's wanted for the assassination of the Turkish Interior Minister in 2001

00:39.016 --> 00:42.166
and for the murders of three CIA agents stationed in Serbia.

00:42.828 --> 00:44.578
Vaughn's movements track with hers.

00:45.330 --> 00:47.651
I am now officially classifying him a fugitive

00:47.652 --> 00:49.280
and your daughter an accomplice.

00:49.829 --> 00:52.279
You'll be notified when they've been apprehended.

00:52.392 --> 00:54.392
What on earth prompted you to risk your own life,

00:54.393 --> 00:56.269
not to mention your professional integrity?

00:56.270 --> 00:59.520
Dad, Vaughn and I, we're having a baby.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.769
I want to know about Prophet Five.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.152
It seemed to be some sort

01:03.153 --> 01:05.519
of advanced genetics 500 years ahead of its time.

01:05.769 --> 01:09.269
When they know you're onto it, they'll stop at nothing to silence you.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.080 --> 01:20.530
You're a hard person to find.

01:21.017 --> 01:22.617
But if I can do it, so can they.

01:24.081 --> 01:25.381
I know who you are, Renée.

01:31.954 --> 01:33.704
It's no accident you found me here.

01:35.082 --> 01:38.432
The people who killed Vaughn... they own this place.

01:40.703 --> 01:42.603
There's an operation center in the back.

01:42.616 --> 01:43.816
I haven't gotten in yet,

01:45.119 --> 01:47.969
but judging the way that man over there is looking at us,

01:49.179 --> 01:50.329
you just blew my cover.

01:53.869 --> 01:54.869
You should go.

01:55.430 --> 01:58.280
- Walk out, slowly.
- What about you?

01:58.679 --> 02:02.029
I didn't spend three months getting in the place to just walk away.

02:04.179 --> 02:05.579
We can access their servers.

02:05.865 --> 02:08.315
That might give me a window into their operation.

02:09.054 --> 02:10.233
I'm going there.

02:11.434 --> 02:12.604
I'm coming with you.

02:26.299 --> 02:29.099
You know the rules. You're not supposed to be back here.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.783
You're gonna want to step aside now.

02:32.796 --> 02:35.846
Sexy. So I'm bein' threatened by a waif and a pregnant chick.

02:40.048 --> 02:41.048
Feeling sexy now?

02:45.297 --> 02:46.297
Get up.

03:00.798 --> 03:02.148
The data's being destroyed.

03:08.860 --> 03:10.510
- I can't stop it.
- Me, neither.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.500
We got it.

03:21.874 --> 03:23.564
It doesn't look like it's been fried.

03:23.565 --> 03:25.165
The data should still be intact.

03:25.749 --> 03:26.749
Probably encrypted.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.876
It won't be a problem. I don't know if Vaughn ever mentioned,

03:31.877 --> 03:33.001
but I work with a genius.

03:33.002 --> 03:35.562
He'll be able to crack the encryption. I'll upload it for you.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.863
Here, take this. It's a secure line.

03:38.312 --> 03:40.212
Dial 9, wait for the tone, dial 8-1-6.

03:41.101 --> 03:43.651
You're not bringing this back to the CIA.

03:43.813 --> 03:46.187
No, we're an off-the-books division. It's different.

03:46.188 --> 03:47.638
Not to me. I don't know them.

03:48.376 --> 03:49.626
I do. You can trust them.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.300
Who says I trust you?

03:54.337 --> 03:55.337
Good point.

03:55.650 --> 03:57.400
What did Michael tell you about me?

03:59.651 --> 04:02.751
Not that much. Just that you've been working with him for years,

04:04.521 --> 04:07.171
and you were the one who told him about Prophet Five.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.147
I understand why you're reluctant.

04:11.148 --> 04:14.084
I mean, you're number eight on the CIA's most wanted list.

04:14.085 --> 04:16.834
I get it, but you have to understand,

04:17.220 --> 04:19.595
these people killed my fiancé...

04:20.396 --> 04:22.270
the father of my child.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.798
I'm gonna enlist

04:23.799 --> 04:26.073
every resource available to immobilize them,

04:26.108 --> 04:29.030
and if that means that this is the last time you and I see each other,

04:29.031 --> 04:30.031
that is fine by me.

04:30.719 --> 04:31.731
Just...

04:32.432 --> 04:33.869
tell me how you wanna do it.

04:35.907 --> 04:37.807
- Number 8?
- Yes.

04:40.596 --> 04:43.296
I'm slipping. I used to be number 6.

04:46.782 --> 04:48.882
You're exactly like Michael said you were.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.637
Fine.

04:54.038 --> 04:56.393
Do it your way. Give me the phone.

04:58.533 --> 04:59.783
You called him "Michael".

05:00.219 --> 05:01.219
Yeah.

05:05.218 --> 05:06.218
Don't worry.

05:07.533 --> 05:08.683
He was crazy about you.

05:17.406 --> 05:20.106
- How've you been feeling?
- Oh, good.

05:20.596 --> 05:23.219
The morning sickness is gone, and my energy's back, so...

05:23.220 --> 05:26.120
Right on schedule. That's normal for the second trimester.

05:26.971 --> 05:28.153
How was your trip?

05:28.254 --> 05:30.071
London, right? Do any shopping?

05:30.344 --> 05:32.594
Oh, it was more of a business trip, actually.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.720
I had to meet with one of my fiancé's old friends.

05:36.596 --> 05:38.846
What about exercise, are you keeping active?

05:40.785 --> 05:43.035
My job is still pretty demanding.

05:43.597 --> 05:44.597
That's great.

05:44.907 --> 05:47.857
Doctors used to tell pregnant women to stay off their feet.

05:47.910 --> 05:49.560
You're pregnant. You're not sick.

05:49.970 --> 05:51.284
As long as you feel comfortable,

05:51.285 --> 05:53.185
you just keep doing what you're doing.

05:53.595 --> 05:54.995
Let's take a look, shall we?

05:57.720 --> 06:00.920
Should I ask the nurse to bring in anyone from the waiting room?

06:02.660 --> 06:04.360
No, I came alone.

06:08.110 --> 06:09.728
You know, Sydney...

06:10.726 --> 06:11.726
You should try.

06:13.854 --> 06:15.454
Okay, let's see how we're doing.

06:22.976 --> 06:24.153
And there we go.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.576
That's your baby.

06:31.366 --> 06:35.766
That's the head, the spine and that pulse...

06:37.992 --> 06:40.042
Look at its little heart.

06:41.928 --> 06:45.628
Mm-hmm. You got an active one there... just like mommy.

06:50.616 --> 06:52.266
Everything looks great.

06:57.804 --> 06:59.504
And I will see you in a few weeks.

08:00.744 --> 08:02.494
This is the man that killed Vaughn.

08:02.868 --> 08:04.068
His name is Ivan Curtis.

08:04.119 --> 08:06.806
He ran operations for a corporate security firm out of Dublin

08:06.807 --> 08:10.307
until three years ago when European Aviation records say he died

08:10.490 --> 08:11.740
in a private plane crash.

08:11.930 --> 08:13.305
It's starting to fit a pattern.

08:13.306 --> 08:15.506
Gordon Dean was presumed dead two years ago.

08:15.557 --> 08:17.362
Both of the men who we know were involved--

08:17.381 --> 08:18.517
From what we've learned,

08:18.554 --> 08:21.493
their operation has been in place for 30 years without being detected.

08:21.494 --> 08:22.670
Whoever these people are,

08:22.671 --> 08:24.928
they must have access to high level resources.

08:24.929 --> 08:26.617
I'm leaving tonight for Washington.

08:26.618 --> 08:28.427
Ahern has some names for me to consider.

08:28.428 --> 08:30.378
Do you still think that's a good idea...

08:30.557 --> 08:33.107
bringing in a new agent now, someone we don't know?

08:34.866 --> 08:37.481
We're down a man, and I trust Ahern's recommendation

08:37.482 --> 08:38.517
without reservation.

08:38.544 --> 08:40.356
In the meantime, Curtis has been in London.

08:40.368 --> 08:41.962
Have Marshall create a facial profile

08:42.111 --> 08:44.365
so we can run him against their surveillance networks.

08:44.366 --> 08:46.741
So Sydney said she got this footage from a contact.

08:46.742 --> 08:48.442
What do we know about this person?

08:49.055 --> 08:50.055
She didn't say.

09:07.057 --> 09:08.757
- Yeah. Hello?
- It's me.

09:08.930 --> 09:11.058
I've been going over the footage from London.

09:11.059 --> 09:12.307
I think I found something.

09:12.308 --> 09:14.308
Hmm. I'd love to, baby, but I'm married.

09:14.367 --> 09:15.967
Oh, Marshall, wake up. Marshall.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.180
I'm up.

09:17.370 --> 09:20.520
I'm up, I'm up. Sorry. Uh... Syd?

09:20.930 --> 09:23.880
I need you to pull up the surveillance footage from London.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.030
Okay, uh, gimme a sec.

09:28.508 --> 09:29.973
You been at this all night?

09:30.067 --> 09:31.494
Are you looking at the footage?

09:31.495 --> 09:32.795
Hold on. Gimme just a sec.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.019
Okay, now I am. What am I lookin' for?

09:39.117 --> 09:42.267
Time index 12-40. Curtis is dialing a number.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.594
- Can you enhance it?
- See what I can do.

09:45.368 --> 09:46.568
That looks like a 4.

09:50.119 --> 09:52.869
That looks like a 3. No, it might be a 5.

09:54.170 --> 09:57.920
You know what? I'll run it against an Echelon call archive. I'll use the 5.

09:59.981 --> 10:01.981
I've got the audio. Patching it through.

10:05.662 --> 10:07.917
They're ordering takeout, Marshall.

10:07.918 --> 10:12.068
Right. Sorry. Must be the 3. All right, got audio. Patching it through.

10:12.685 --> 10:14.935
- Allo?
- Any news on my package?

10:14.977 --> 10:16.592
Not yet. I'm still workin' on it.

10:16.620 --> 10:19.223
I'm growing impatient. If this is becoming a problem for you...

10:19.224 --> 10:21.033
I haven't disappointed you yet, have I?

10:21.034 --> 10:22.834
25 more kilos. I'll have it for you.

10:22.906 --> 10:25.404
Fine. I'll be there to pick it up. Don't let me down.

10:25.423 --> 10:26.522
Looks like we got our guy.

10:26.569 --> 10:28.537
Who was Curtis talking to? Can you run a trace?

10:28.538 --> 10:29.538
Yeah. Um...

10:30.910 --> 10:33.598
Uh, actually, it's not just the server, Bob.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.709
You need to run a diagnostic on the entire network.

10:35.747 --> 10:36.897
What?

10:36.898 --> 10:38.098
Can you hold on one sec?

10:39.334 --> 10:41.384
Who's Bob? I never heard you mention Bob.

10:41.398 --> 10:44.898
Yeah, but you know Bob. Bobby. He works in the... corner.

10:45.524 --> 10:48.824
Uh, he brings in the... ...the dark roast... coffee.

10:53.335 --> 10:54.585
I'm not having an affair.

10:54.962 --> 10:58.712
I know you're not having an affair. I just don't want you to wake Mitchell.

10:59.146 --> 11:01.146
- Oh, okay
- Okay.

11:06.396 --> 11:09.696
You, uh, you think she believed me, right?

11:09.897 --> 11:11.697
Yeah, Marshall. I think you're okay.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.335
Good. I'll run a trace on that call.

11:13.336 --> 11:14.336
Okay.

11:18.336 --> 11:23.136
It belongs to a Heinrich Roemer. Where do I know that name from?

11:42.023 --> 11:43.023
You're beautiful.

11:46.128 --> 11:47.894
What you must be going through...

11:53.480 --> 11:55.164
One of the men responsible,

11:55.365 --> 11:56.530
Ivan Curtis,

11:57.233 --> 12:00.533
he's been in contact with an arms dealer. Heinrich Roemer.

12:01.792 --> 12:04.192
According to SD-6 files, you've worked with him.

12:05.981 --> 12:08.881
Yes, he supplied arms to several SD cells.

12:09.731 --> 12:13.131
Curtis is planning a meet with Roemer. We don't know when.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.794
We need to locate Roemer's base of operations,

12:15.795 --> 12:17.445
get inside, wire it with cameras.

12:18.481 --> 12:20.602
So you can monitor him and wait for Curtis

12:20.603 --> 12:22.131
to make contact. I understand.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.581
This is your first lead, isn't it, Sydney?

12:29.606 --> 12:33.306
Yeah. Look, I know how important this is to you,

12:34.984 --> 12:38.134
but revenge is ultimately a hollow pursuit, Sydney.

12:38.357 --> 12:39.807
This isn't about revenge.

12:40.358 --> 12:42.708
They know who I am, they know where I work,

12:43.608 --> 12:46.208
and as long as they're out there, I am not safe.

12:47.356 --> 12:48.356
Okay.

12:49.732 --> 12:51.382
Roemer operates out of Amsterdam.

12:52.858 --> 12:54.758
Tactical entry is out of the question.

12:54.859 --> 12:56.559
Roemer is paranoid about security.

12:57.608 --> 12:59.508
You'll have to go in posing as buyers.

13:00.358 --> 13:02.958
There's a vending machine on Ballister, near Amstel.

13:03.669 --> 13:05.119
Enter the sequence 5-1-0-9-4.

13:08.169 --> 13:10.169
Shortly thereafter, you'll be contacted.

13:10.985 --> 13:13.185
Then all you need are the proper bona fides.

13:17.984 --> 13:20.684
Roemer's security system is capable of detecting bugs.

13:20.857 --> 13:24.007
Your best option is to piggy-back off his closed circuit feeds.

13:32.297 --> 13:33.297
Right jacket pocket.

13:37.171 --> 13:38.271
Keep it. A small gift.

13:40.857 --> 13:41.857
Follow me.

13:50.798 --> 13:53.172
Okay. I'm ready to hack into their surveillance system.

13:53.173 --> 13:54.952
You'll just need a directed RF pulse

13:54.953 --> 13:57.323
from your wristwatch for each interior camera.

13:57.595 --> 13:59.419
Gentlemen. Welcome.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.595
Heinrich Roemer.

14:02.920 --> 14:03.999
Jalin Khamisi.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.820
It's my pleasure.

14:07.005 --> 14:08.005
Oh. Sorry.

14:08.378 --> 14:09.701
My business manager

14:10.502 --> 14:11.578
Isaac Malcolm.

14:13.132 --> 14:14.132
Have a seat.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.255
So...

14:18.253 --> 14:20.303
who do I have to thank for your business?

14:20.316 --> 14:21.816
A mutual friend. Jean Briault.

14:23.820 --> 14:26.570
We worked together in Montreal.  He spoke highly of you.

14:27.505 --> 14:29.955
Jean Briault. I haven't heard that name in years.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.803
He was a good man. It is a pity what happened.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.343
Well, what can I do for you?

14:44.817 --> 14:46.100
"3,000 kalashnikov rifles,

14:46.101 --> 14:48.567
75-man portable shoulder-fired stinger missiles,

14:50.773 --> 14:52.073
m77 anti-personnel mines."

14:54.525 --> 14:57.175
What exactly would you do with a purchase this large?

14:57.524 --> 14:59.724
I intend to secure some beachfront property.

15:07.712 --> 15:09.762
An order of this size... it won't be easy.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.400
I couldn't do it for less than, say... $5 million.

15:18.899 --> 15:21.199
Uh, Mr. Khamisi will forward an additional 20%

15:22.711 --> 15:24.811
if you can complete delivery by... Friday.

15:26.274 --> 15:28.424
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, Mr. Khamisi.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.960
- I'm sorry.
- It's no matter.

15:32.483 --> 15:33.933
No, it is, and it's my fault.

15:33.965 --> 15:35.815
Do you have someplace I can clean up?

15:37.338 --> 15:38.488
He'll show you the way.

15:38.903 --> 15:39.903
Thank you.

15:45.024 --> 15:47.324
Outrigger, camera one is up, connection solid.

15:58.775 --> 15:59.825
Camera two is online.

16:03.150 --> 16:04.950
- How are the video signals?
- Good.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.542
Outrigger, we've got company.

16:11.591 --> 16:12.777
It's Curtis.

16:13.878 --> 16:15.441
He's here. You gotta move now.

16:15.499 --> 16:18.099
No. I know what you're thinking. Hold your position.

16:22.937 --> 16:24.998
Mr Roemer wasn't expecting you until tonight.

16:24.999 --> 16:26.949
Plans change. I took an earlier flight.

16:27.437 --> 16:29.087
I assume that won't be a problem.

16:29.313 --> 16:31.563
Of course not. I'll let him know you're here.

16:39.812 --> 16:41.012
I take payment via wire.

16:41.374 --> 16:43.174
Currency is too easy to counterfeit.

16:43.186 --> 16:44.186
Of course.

16:45.376 --> 16:46.376
Curtis.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.061
Yeah.

16:48.062 --> 16:51.112
If you'll excuse me, just a small matter I need to attend to.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.975
Please make sure our guest is comfortable.

17:01.690 --> 17:03.090
Mr Curtis. Good to see you.

17:03.374 --> 17:04.374
Where's my package?

17:05.440 --> 17:06.940
Well, your item arrived today.

17:07.186 --> 17:08.837
25 kilos of nuridium as promised.

17:10.251 --> 17:12.501
Which leaves us just a matter of the payment.

17:14.252 --> 17:15.252
Sure thing.

17:27.999 --> 17:28.999
Thank you.

17:43.815 --> 17:44.815
Weiss is in trouble.

17:52.631 --> 17:53.814
I'm on it.

17:53.815 --> 17:54.815
Thanks.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.050
Come on. We gotta go.

18:06.941 --> 18:07.941
Need a ride?

18:15.065 --> 18:16.065
Get up!

18:22.126 --> 18:23.276
Would you take it easy?

18:23.316 --> 18:24.316
Shut up.

18:29.502 --> 18:31.626
Hey, listen, Syd, Dixon and I can handle this.

18:31.627 --> 18:32.927
No, I'm gonna talk to him.

18:35.755 --> 18:38.305
All right, fine. I'll be right here if you need me.

18:44.816 --> 18:45.866
Can we have a minute?

18:52.004 --> 18:53.170
Do you recognize me?

18:54.171 --> 18:55.204
No.

18:56.626 --> 18:59.276
Four months ago, you murdered a man... Michael Vaughn.

19:00.316 --> 19:01.583
Do you remember?

19:03.184 --> 19:04.248
I do.

19:04.549 --> 19:05.566
I was there.

19:07.176 --> 19:09.876
It'll be burned into my memory for the rest of my life

19:10.050 --> 19:11.850
as the day my child lost its father.

19:15.365 --> 19:17.665
So you can imagine what I'd like to do to you.

19:18.927 --> 19:21.227
Lucky for you, there someone I want even more.

19:23.112 --> 19:24.962
Tell me where I can find Gordon Dean.

19:26.678 --> 19:28.828
Is this whole routine supposed to scare me?

19:29.237 --> 19:30.387
I do this for a living.

19:32.863 --> 19:34.613
It's a funny thing about pregnancy.

19:35.677 --> 19:36.677
Hormones.

19:39.989 --> 19:40.989
I woke up today...

19:43.615 --> 19:44.815
feeling pretty hormonal.

19:48.989 --> 19:50.689
I'm gonna give you another chance.

19:55.738 --> 19:56.788
Where is Gordon Dean?

20:03.929 --> 20:06.829
Nuridium. That's some pretty nasty stuff. That's for sure.

20:08.487 --> 20:10.677
Uh, all right. Go ahead. Give me the lot number.

20:10.678 --> 20:11.678
"6-6-4-R-T-4-5-6-9."

20:15.714 --> 20:18.050
Yeah, NASA's been experimenting with nuridium

20:18.051 --> 20:20.551
as a long-term power source for deep space probes.

20:20.615 --> 20:22.425
Problem is, it's inherently unstable.

20:22.426 --> 20:24.926
It's most easily suited as a high-yield explosive.

20:25.429 --> 20:26.988
You know, I'm talkin' megaton here.

20:26.989 --> 20:29.989
Some big bang, kinda crazy badass stuff.

20:30.051 --> 20:32.501
But, uh, wait a minute. RT4569?

20:33.113 --> 20:34.237
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

20:34.238 --> 20:35.488
Yes, Marshall.

20:36.177 --> 20:38.627
You have no idea what you're getting involved in.

20:38.679 --> 20:40.029
Why don't you enlighten me?

20:40.052 --> 20:41.302
You wanna know the truth?

20:42.677 --> 20:43.677
The truth is

20:45.114 --> 20:46.614
you're better off not knowing.

20:51.676 --> 20:52.676
We need to talk.

20:58.181 --> 21:00.008
Six canisters of nuridium disappeared

21:00.009 --> 21:02.181
from a Russian processing plant last month

21:02.210 --> 21:04.363
from the same lot as the one we just recovered.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.129
The phone call between Curtis and Roemer

21:06.157 --> 21:08.016
they talked about the rest of the shipment.

21:08.044 --> 21:10.288
We think that Curtis already has the other canisters.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.754
Our options here are limited, Syd.

21:15.615 --> 21:18.180
But we think if we let him go, there's a really good chance

21:18.181 --> 21:20.531
that he'll lead us to the rest of the nuridium.

21:20.741 --> 21:21.791
You wanna let him go.

21:21.819 --> 21:23.615
We'll make him believe he's escaped.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.222
No. We can't risk losing him.

21:25.260 --> 21:26.627
The risks will be minimal.

21:26.628 --> 21:28.116
We just need more time to break him.

21:28.144 --> 21:29.562
We don't have more time.

21:30.490 --> 21:34.340
With that much nuridium, we may be looking at Hiroshima times 50.

21:37.178 --> 21:39.978
We're talking about releasing the man who killed Vaughn.

21:52.663 --> 21:53.713
Water?

21:55.014 --> 21:56.213
Thank you.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.330
We know about the nuridium.

22:07.292 --> 22:08.292
I see.

22:08.605 --> 22:11.455
Possession of nuridium is considered an act of terrorism,

22:11.730 --> 22:14.180
based on which we can lock you away indefinitely.

22:14.605 --> 22:17.505
No formal charges, no trial.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.270
But right now that does neither of us any good.

22:20.857 --> 22:22.957
Tell us where the rest of the nuridium is,

22:23.106 --> 22:25.906
what you intend to do with it, and we'll cut you a deal.

22:30.312 --> 22:31.461
I want immunity...

22:32.962 --> 22:34.062
for everything

22:34.921 --> 22:36.921
the nuridium and killing Michael Vaughn.

22:42.857 --> 22:44.157
You'd do it, wouldn't you?

22:47.043 --> 22:48.043
You'd have to.

22:53.545 --> 22:55.145
Well, I'll save you the trouble.

22:56.170 --> 22:57.255
No deal.

22:58.056 --> 22:59.220
I'm not talking.

23:03.058 --> 23:04.058
Sorry, baby.

23:05.995 --> 23:08.695
Daddy just went snooping where he shouldn't have gone.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.244
Did he drink enough?

23:24.358 --> 23:25.621
Yeah.

23:25.622 --> 23:27.252
I'd say we've got about two hours

23:27.253 --> 23:29.772
before the tracking serum enters his bloodstream.

23:29.995 --> 23:31.745
All right, I'll set up the scanner.

23:40.746 --> 23:42.560
That stuff will poison you, you know.

23:43.561 --> 23:44.746
Liberal rag.

23:47.097 --> 23:48.947
Coffee's not too good for you either.

23:50.657 --> 23:51.907
I think I found your man.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.723
Ouider, like you asked, but fully documented.

23:55.285 --> 23:56.685
No family, no entanglements.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.360
Just off a 4-year tour with the special ops.

24:03.721 --> 24:04.762
I know.

24:05.463 --> 24:07.221
I assume you can deal with that.

24:09.422 --> 24:11.372
They say he also has a bit of a temper.

24:24.362 --> 24:29.062
Seriously, something has to be done about your breath.

24:29.741 --> 24:30.991
Oh, yeah? How about this?

24:35.366 --> 24:36.366
Jackass.

24:44.055 --> 24:45.055
Thomas Grace?

24:47.119 --> 24:48.119
Who wants to know?

24:49.616 --> 24:50.616
Let's take a walk.

24:53.618 --> 24:56.168
Did you know that we have astronaut ice cream here?

24:56.804 --> 25:00.404
The neapolitan is a little nasty, but apparently it lasts for centuries.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.620
- Still nothing?
- Nothing.

25:08.181 --> 25:10.299
You know, how quickly the isotope is absorbed

25:10.300 --> 25:11.865
depends on this guy's metabolism.

25:11.866 --> 25:13.416
It's been two and a half hours.

25:13.430 --> 25:15.080
It's going to hit, Syd. Trust me.

25:20.741 --> 25:23.741
All right, you know what? I can't wait with this any longer.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.130
I've been offered a promotion

25:27.369 --> 25:29.999
to coordinate the covert ops for the N.S.C.,

25:30.112 --> 25:31.641
and I've known about it for a week.

25:31.669 --> 25:34.702
I asked your father not to tell you 'cause I wanted to tell you myself,

25:34.721 --> 25:36.572
but there hasn't been a really great time...

25:36.609 --> 25:38.422
Wait a minute. In D.C.?

25:38.932 --> 25:40.732
Yeah. Steps away from the President.

25:43.305 --> 25:44.305
Well, that's great

25:47.056 --> 25:48.056
That's good news.

25:53.244 --> 25:54.244
I'm gonna miss you.

25:56.933 --> 26:00.000
But I'm really, really happy for you.

26:07.559 --> 26:08.909
- I can't do it.
- Weiss...

26:08.933 --> 26:10.533
No, I can't do it. Come on, Syd.

26:11.619 --> 26:14.619
Vaughn, Nadia. I mean, to leave now just doesn't seem right.

26:14.994 --> 26:17.992
Listen to what you're saying. Steps away from the President.

26:17.993 --> 26:18.993
Oh, I know.

26:19.809 --> 26:21.059
You can't say no to that.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.721
Okay, we got a signal on Curtis.

26:30.764 --> 26:31.869
Where is he?

26:31.870 --> 26:34.620
I can't tell. It's not pinpointing.

26:36.684 --> 26:38.584
That's because he's not on the ground.

26:40.620 --> 26:42.183
All right, during the hivernal equinox,

26:42.184 --> 26:44.242
you can actually balance an egg on its end.

26:44.243 --> 26:45.593
No, you can't. It's a myth.

26:45.630 --> 26:46.682
No, it's not.

26:46.683 --> 26:48.708
It has something to do with the Earth's axis

26:48.709 --> 26:50.058
and the alignment of the sun.

26:50.059 --> 26:51.772
Trust me. I googled it.

26:51.807 --> 26:55.457
Yeah, okay, just like water swirls the other way in toilets in Australia?

26:56.060 --> 26:57.360
- It does.
- Hello.

27:00.784 --> 27:03.084
Guys, I'm gonna take this. I'll be right back.

27:07.161 --> 27:08.861
Mr Curtis, what can I do for you?

27:09.533 --> 27:11.133
Let Dean know we are on our way.

27:11.284 --> 27:12.784
We've got the device on board,

27:12.785 --> 27:16.185
but I am going to need the analysis team to meet us at the airfield.

27:16.221 --> 27:17.221
Of course.

27:17.784 --> 27:19.734
We're 200 miles out. Right on schedule.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.618
At 1700 hours, Ivan Curtis boarded a private jet.

27:38.637 --> 27:40.778
Marshall pulled the cargo manifests from Schiphol.

27:40.796 --> 27:41.801
Curtis loaded

27:41.829 --> 27:43.723
several oversized containers onto the plane.

27:43.724 --> 27:45.033
He's transporting the weapon.

27:45.034 --> 27:47.741
The flight plan indicates their final destination is Pyongyang.

27:47.778 --> 27:49.553
The flight was granted diplomatic immunity.

27:49.581 --> 27:51.336
Diplomatic immunity? How's that possible?

27:51.350 --> 27:52.660
We're still exploring that.

27:52.661 --> 27:54.778
We can't just let these guys fly to North Korea.

27:54.806 --> 27:56.562
There's gotta be something we can do.

27:57.162 --> 27:58.162
Maybe there is.

28:07.785 --> 28:08.935
We're just about there.

28:31.038 --> 28:34.388
What's their current position? Do we have an ETA for rendezvous?

28:35.100 --> 28:37.050
Okay, the docking point is 2 miles out.

28:37.226 --> 28:38.526
Final approach for hookup.

28:38.705 --> 28:40.910
Is there any indication they've been detected?

28:40.911 --> 28:42.161
No. A.T.C.'s still blind.

28:42.473 --> 28:43.509
And I was able to jam

28:43.510 --> 28:46.073
the airliner's traffic collision avoidance system.

28:46.349 --> 28:47.598
They don't know we're coming.

28:47.599 --> 28:48.634
Good. Keep me posted.

28:48.635 --> 28:51.099
I want to know the second that plane is secured.

28:59.974 --> 29:00.974
Okay.

29:45.975 --> 29:47.325
Docking tube's pressurized.

30:11.626 --> 30:12.911
Yes?

30:12.912 --> 30:14.662
Rendezvous complete. They're onboard.

30:14.663 --> 30:15.663
Good. Thank you.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.387
- Flinkman.
- Hey, it's me.

30:31.539 --> 30:33.476
Oh, yeah, I know. I gave you your own ringtone.

30:33.477 --> 30:34.727
So did you find the bomb?

30:34.788 --> 30:36.412
I'm standing right in front of it.

30:36.413 --> 30:38.792
Okay, great. Well, what do you see? Tell me about it.

30:38.839 --> 30:40.266
It's about 8 feet by 3 feet.

30:44.663 --> 30:46.463
There's a hose running alongside it.

30:46.493 --> 30:48.643
Looks like it's feeding the nuridium into the panel.

30:48.671 --> 30:50.200
Okay, you need to access that panel.

30:50.247 --> 30:51.815
Can you get to it? Can you open it?

30:51.862 --> 30:53.280
Let me see. Just give me a sec.

30:56.352 --> 30:57.502
Three Tango. On my go.

30:59.290 --> 31:00.290
Three, two... one.

31:20.977 --> 31:22.602
Go, go, go, go. Oh, you know what?

31:22.603 --> 31:25.604
There should be a detonator attached to the regulator. Do you see that?

31:25.605 --> 31:26.655
Okay. I don't see it.

31:26.899 --> 31:29.538
Well, it has to be there, because without a detonator,

31:29.539 --> 31:31.353
there's no detonation. That's how it works.

31:31.354 --> 31:33.350
Fine. I'm just telling you, it's not here.

31:33.351 --> 31:35.101
Well, Syd, it has to be there, okay?

31:35.102 --> 31:37.352
Because there is no bomb without a detonator.

31:51.290 --> 31:52.326
Marshall...

31:53.327 --> 31:54.690
I don't think it's a bomb.

31:58.540 --> 32:00.590
I don't believe you have a boarding pass.

32:11.225 --> 32:12.225
Go ahead. Shoot me.

32:13.728 --> 32:15.805
But if you do, there's a damn good chance

32:15.806 --> 32:18.178
my hand will slip and I'll cut this connection.

32:21.727 --> 32:24.349
Whoever this guy is, he's obviously pretty important to you.

32:24.350 --> 32:26.600
It'd be a shame if something happened to him.

32:28.039 --> 32:29.489
Step away from the container.

32:31.664 --> 32:32.664
I don't think so.

32:33.041 --> 32:34.041
Dixon, cover me!

32:52.041 --> 32:54.541
You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into.

32:54.978 --> 32:55.978
I'll ask you once,

32:57.103 --> 32:59.303
and if you don't answer me, I will cut this.

33:00.977 --> 33:02.227
Who is Dean working with?

33:02.789 --> 33:04.889
Who gave the order to kill Michael Vaughn?

33:05.729 --> 33:07.929
Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

33:10.789 --> 33:11.789
Humor me.

33:37.791 --> 33:38.841
Going in the cockpit.

33:48.355 --> 33:49.955
- I got him. Take him.
- Got it.

34:05.852 --> 34:07.102
What are you waiting for?

34:12.976 --> 34:15.275
Turn around, on your knees. I'm taking you in.

34:17.476 --> 34:18.516
Then...

34:19.318 --> 34:20.677
you might as well kill me.

34:21.411 --> 34:23.262
I won't survive the night in custody.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.040
If you're willing to cooperate, we can protect you.

34:26.041 --> 34:27.041
No.

34:27.663 --> 34:28.663
You have no idea.

34:30.725 --> 34:31.925
- These people...
- Who?

34:45.978 --> 34:47.476
Our initial assumptions were wrong.

34:47.476 --> 34:49.773
The nuridium wasn't being utilized as an explosive.

34:49.820 --> 34:52.476
We believe it was used to power a cryogenic chamber.

34:53.914 --> 34:55.538
You mean freezing people, cryogenics?

34:55.539 --> 34:57.939
Sort of. It's usually done with liquid nitrogen,

34:58.101 --> 35:00.251
but this is like next-gen cryopreservation.

35:00.413 --> 35:02.363
I mean, whoever this person is or was...

35:03.750 --> 35:05.788
they probably died of a terminal illness,

35:05.789 --> 35:07.539
and they're using this container to

35:07.567 --> 35:09.567
preserve the corpse until a treatment is found.

35:09.604 --> 35:10.959
Of course, the notion that anyone

35:10.960 --> 35:13.013
can ever actually be revived-- complete fiction.

35:13.060 --> 35:14.262
Believe me, I've tried.

35:15.477 --> 35:16.677
Have we I.D.'ed the body?

35:16.790 --> 35:19.351
Not yet. The container is currently in D.S.R. Custody.

35:19.352 --> 35:22.227
They'll forward us the forensic analysis as soon as it's complete.

35:22.228 --> 35:25.601
An evidence team scoured the plane for anything that might be of value,

35:25.602 --> 35:27.605
but I'm not expecting anything to come of it.

35:27.606 --> 35:29.506
For now, we've done everything we can.

35:29.605 --> 35:31.605
We'll just have to wait for the reports.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.041
Sydney...

35:55.730 --> 35:57.580
We lost our only lead on Gordon Dean.

36:03.353 --> 36:05.103
I'm not sure if I can do this, dad.

36:05.856 --> 36:07.956
- We'll get another lead.
- It's not that.

36:11.165 --> 36:12.365
It's everything. It's...

36:18.978 --> 36:20.378
It's hard being without him.

36:30.540 --> 36:33.540
I saw the baby's heartbeat for the first time the other day.

36:35.603 --> 36:36.603
I was by myself.

36:42.843 --> 36:43.915
It's not fair.

36:43.916 --> 36:45.216
He should have been there.

36:50.604 --> 36:51.604
I'm here.

36:54.791 --> 36:55.791
How can I help?

37:00.729 --> 37:03.029
My next doctor's appointment's in a few weeks.

37:05.732 --> 37:06.782
Would you go with me?

37:09.169 --> 37:10.619
Sweetheart, of course I will.

37:19.916 --> 37:20.916
Sydney...

37:22.733 --> 37:23.783
You're gonna be okay.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.120
Yeah.

37:31.122 --> 37:32.127
Yeah.

37:59.607 --> 38:01.157
Hey, how you doing? Eric Weiss.

38:02.168 --> 38:03.518
- Tom Grace.
- Hi, Tom.

38:05.607 --> 38:08.707
Uh, listen, this desk isn't exactly an ideal location for you.

38:08.777 --> 38:11.607
It's, you know, right under the air conditioning vent,

38:11.608 --> 38:13.708
and there's actually a wobble in the desk.

38:16.731 --> 38:17.731
You know?

38:19.033 --> 38:20.593
Yeah. I get it.

38:21.109 --> 38:22.909
The guy I'm replacing... he sat here.

38:25.669 --> 38:27.069
You can have mine. That's...

38:28.366 --> 38:30.856
I'm not gonna need it anymore, and, you know, actually,

38:30.857 --> 38:32.757
I suppose you're replacing me as well.

38:36.860 --> 38:38.560
These are really good people here.

38:38.608 --> 38:39.608
Yeah.

38:40.608 --> 38:41.608
Hey.

38:51.047 --> 38:52.297
I'll see you soon enough.

38:55.107 --> 38:56.248
That's all I know.

38:58.049 --> 38:59.607
We'd better notify Jack.

38:59.608 --> 39:00.608
Yeah.

39:01.670 --> 39:02.670
Yeah. Go, go.

39:26.367 --> 39:27.367
- Hello?
- Hey.

39:27.869 --> 39:28.869
Got your message.

39:29.180 --> 39:30.630
Have you identified the body?

39:30.742 --> 39:32.942
That's why I'm calling. The body was stolen.

39:33.868 --> 39:36.054
It was being held by a Scientific Research division.

39:36.055 --> 39:37.205
Their facility was hit.

39:37.242 --> 39:40.292
Once I get the incident report, I'll forward you the details.

39:40.307 --> 39:41.466
I'll dig around.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.200
See what I can find out.
