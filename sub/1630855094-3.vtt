00:10.010 --> 00:11.315
<i>Previously on</i> From...

00:11.315 --> 00:12.490
We have to get inside!
We'll be safe in there.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.970
I'll be right behind you.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.756
Fuck!

00:17.756 --> 00:19.410
Why were you
screaming like that?

00:19.410 --> 00:21.282
I had a really bad dream.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.066
Your mom needs you, okay?

00:23.066 --> 00:24.415
Go and get help.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.640
Dad!

00:31.640 --> 00:33.076
Julie!

00:34.860 --> 00:36.340
- No!
- Stop!

00:36.340 --> 00:39.039
- Get inside!
- We can't just leave them!

00:39.039 --> 00:40.910
This bitch blew out our ride
home with a fucking shotgun!

00:40.910 --> 00:43.260
You have no idea
what you're doing.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.219
This whole time
you've been less than

00:45.219 --> 00:48.526
two hours away
with these people.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.833
It isn't what you think.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.140
Stop fucking smiling!

00:53.140 --> 00:55.577
You'll feel better
if you come outside.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.318
I can't fucking
do this anymore.

00:57.318 --> 00:58.971
I know.

00:58.971 --> 01:02.018
You shouldn't be doing this.
Victor wouldn't like it.

01:02.018 --> 01:05.108
Every time I see something
really weird, I see this.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.240
This symbol.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.024
It's not safe here.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.547
This is where they sleep.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.512
Come on, Victor.
Go, Victor, go!

01:17.512 --> 01:20.297
Maybe this is just gonna be like
one of those crazy stories

01:20.297 --> 01:22.560
that we just tell at parties,
and it'll be fun and--

01:22.560 --> 01:24.910
Is anyone in there?

01:24.910 --> 01:27.913
Please help us.
We were on a bus.

01:27.913 --> 01:31.178
You ever wonder
if Abby was right?

01:31.178 --> 01:32.527
What if it's all just a dream?

01:36.052 --> 01:37.532
Ah!

01:37.532 --> 01:39.751
My blood is your blood now.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.020
What do you mean it collapsed?
Which house collapsed?

01:48.020 --> 01:49.239
The one next to the diner.

01:49.239 --> 01:50.980
- Oh my God!
- Tabitha!

02:30.280 --> 02:35.285
So, she pushed you
into a tree, and then you...

02:35.285 --> 02:38.201
I-- Then I was
someplace else.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.378
So you, like--

02:41.378 --> 02:43.641
So, you're saying you,
like, teleported?

02:43.641 --> 02:47.210
No, I... Maybe.
I don't know.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.386
When you say it like that,
it sounds frickin' crazy.

02:49.386 --> 02:53.129
Dad, where is Sara?

02:53.129 --> 02:55.349
I don't know.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.133
She said she was gonna
be right behind me.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.265
So, do you think she's alive?

02:58.265 --> 03:00.092
I don't know.

03:00.092 --> 03:02.747
Okay, look, I need you to really
just take me through this, okay?

03:02.747 --> 03:06.142
Look, you went through
a tree and then what?

03:06.142 --> 03:08.753
Then I was back here.

03:08.753 --> 03:11.365
How?

03:11.365 --> 03:13.105
I got lucky.
I found my way. I-I--

03:13.105 --> 03:14.933
No, look, look,
if you don't wanna tell me,

03:14.933 --> 03:16.892
just say that you
don't wanna tell me.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.763
- Hey.
- No, no. Dad. Dad.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.852
You said that
you were gonna find answers.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.506
You said you were
gonna go out there

03:22.506 --> 03:24.291
and find answers
or find a way home!

03:24.291 --> 03:25.770
That's what you said!

03:25.770 --> 03:27.598
And now we're exactly
where we fucking started!

03:27.598 --> 03:29.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:29.600 --> 03:31.036
Hey, what's going on here?

03:31.036 --> 03:33.735
Ellis, hey.
Talk to me.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.302
What--
What happened?

03:38.305 --> 03:39.523
What's happening, son?

03:46.313 --> 03:49.664
Fatima. She, um...

03:50.882 --> 03:53.798
Look, last night
it got bad.

03:53.798 --> 03:54.930
Dad, it got really bad.

03:57.367 --> 04:00.675
Yeah, I, I feel like
the people that make it here,

04:00.675 --> 04:01.806
it's because they...

04:04.200 --> 04:07.682
There's a part of themselves
that they hold on to.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.379
Right.

04:09.379 --> 04:13.035
And... I just think, you know...

04:14.732 --> 04:17.300
Look, last night
I feel like I saw

04:17.300 --> 04:21.435
that piece of her...
start to slip away.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.002
I got it. Okay.

04:25.743 --> 04:27.092
Hey, hey.
Look at me.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.356
Look at me.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.274
Then it has
to be you, okay?

04:34.274 --> 04:38.147
You have to be that piece of her
that this place can't take away.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.671
That's how
we get through this. Okay?

04:40.671 --> 04:42.369
Even if we lose our way,

04:42.369 --> 04:45.546
we hold on to each other
and we keep trying.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.157
'Til we get home.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.029
'Til we get home.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.030
That's right.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.730
This place
will not win.

04:55.730 --> 04:56.731
You understand me?

04:58.689 --> 04:59.864
Good.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.563
Come here. Come.

05:07.219 --> 05:08.569
Alright.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.008
- Okay.
- Um...

05:14.618 --> 05:16.228
I'm gonna go give
Kenny a hand

05:16.228 --> 05:17.752
checking on
the animal traps and--

05:17.752 --> 05:19.928
Let somebody else do that.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.277
Go see Fatima.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.279
Well, I--

05:23.279 --> 05:25.542
You know, I figured while
I was out there I could, uh,

05:25.542 --> 05:27.588
pick her some of those
wildflowers she likes.

05:27.588 --> 05:30.025
- Good. Good. Good man.
- Yeah.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.070
Hey, you know what?
You should, uh,

05:32.070 --> 05:33.811
think about getting
her a new ring.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.205
That little wire doo-dad, I--

05:36.205 --> 05:38.816
Hey, you're better
than that.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.427
Right?

05:42.472 --> 05:44.213
I'm glad you're back, Dad.

05:45.301 --> 05:46.694
Yeah.

- Breathe, breathe, breathe.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.055

08:11.055 --> 08:12.013
Good.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.496
Alright.
Just try to keep it dry, okay?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.236
Yeah.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.282
We can take them out in
probably a week or two, alright?

08:20.282 --> 08:21.370
So, we're done here, then?

08:21.370 --> 08:22.893
Ah, you have...

08:22.893 --> 08:25.896
...three cracked ribs
and probably a bruised lung.

08:25.896 --> 08:28.246
I wouldn't exactly
call that fine, okay?

08:28.246 --> 08:29.683
You okay, Dad?

08:29.683 --> 08:31.815
Yeah, buddy.

08:31.815 --> 08:34.426
Just catching my breath,
that's all.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.950
How you doing?

08:35.950 --> 08:38.605
I... heard you had
a pretty rough night too.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.433
She was on a quest with Victor.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.434
I'm okay.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.486
Um, look, bottom line is,
you got really lucky.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.444
So just don't do anything
to make it worse, okay?

08:52.444 --> 08:53.489
Alright.

08:53.489 --> 08:54.708
I'll check back on you in a bit.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.100
- Alright.
- Thank you.

09:00.670 --> 09:05.066
Kids, can you give me
and your mom a second?

09:05.066 --> 09:06.241
Yeah. Of course.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.163
Donna said we could
stay at the Colony House,

09:15.163 --> 09:17.165
but there's no way in hell
I'm taking the kids--

09:17.165 --> 09:18.122
Tabby.

09:19.384 --> 09:24.215
Hey. Hey. Hey.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.436
I thought you were dead.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.742
I'm sorry.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.308
- I thought--
- I know. I'm so sorry.

09:30.308 --> 09:31.266
I'm so sorry.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.441
I can't lose you.

09:33.529 --> 09:34.443
No, no, no.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.234
Jim...

09:43.234 --> 09:46.237
the wires aren't
connected to anything.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.804
What?

09:47.804 --> 09:49.719
Yeah, they were just
dangling from the ceiling.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.680
How'd there be any electricity

09:53.680 --> 09:55.116
if the wires
aren't connected?

09:55.116 --> 09:57.858
Tabitha, we have
so much to talk about.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.384
How are the kids holding up?

10:05.909 --> 10:06.910
I don't know.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.829
I think I'm gonna
take them to the diner

10:12.829 --> 10:16.354
to see if I can get some food.
I don't know when they've eaten.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.312
I love you.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.530
I love you too.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.061
You are not
listening to me.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.498
No, I'm listening,
and I'm telling you to fuck off.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.065
You think after
what happened last night

10:31.065 --> 10:32.370
I'm just gonna trust you people?

10:32.370 --> 10:33.937
That is not gonna
do any good against

10:33.937 --> 10:35.460
those things
that come out at night!

10:35.460 --> 10:37.724
All you're gonna do is
make everyone here nervous.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.813
No, but it's okay for you to
start shooting out fuckin' tires

10:39.813 --> 10:42.163
though, right? Because that made
people real fuckin' calm!

10:42.163 --> 10:43.599
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You are a f--

10:43.599 --> 10:46.602
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey, hey, Donna.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.909
What's-- What's goin' on here?
What's goin' on, Donna?

10:48.909 --> 10:49.997
Who the fuck are you?

10:51.259 --> 10:53.174
Boyd Stevens.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.219
I'm the sheriff.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.960
I thought the Asian guy
was the sheriff.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.529
We're just having a little
disagreement about firearms.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.226
Residents don't carry guns.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.314
That's the rule.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.707
And whose rule
is that?

11:04.707 --> 11:05.708
Mine.

11:05.708 --> 11:09.669
Well, uh, rules change.

11:10.757 --> 11:11.758
No, no, no.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.455
Got it, hold, hold up.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.892
Look. I understand.

11:15.892 --> 11:19.374
I understand this is
all pretty scary, right?

11:19.374 --> 11:21.593
But I've had
a strange fuckin' week,

11:21.593 --> 11:23.508
so I'm a little less
patient than normal.

11:23.508 --> 11:26.381
You don't like the rules. Great.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.731
You take your rifle,
you go live out in the woods,

11:28.731 --> 11:30.341
and make whatever
rules you like.

11:30.341 --> 11:31.342
See how long you last.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.475
Now, now.

11:33.475 --> 11:36.130
You want a roof over your head
at night when those things

11:36.130 --> 11:40.395
come out to hunt, then you put
the fucking rifle down

11:40.395 --> 11:41.701
and you listen to the lady.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.362
That's a good choice.

11:51.362 --> 11:52.624
Mm.

11:52.624 --> 11:53.625
Mm-hm.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.065
Listen.

11:59.893 --> 12:04.114
We're all... gonna have

12:04.114 --> 12:07.291
the time to talk, okay?
Answer all your questions.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.772
- Just know...
- Asshole.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.427
...that we are all
in this thing together,

12:12.427 --> 12:16.953
and the only way to get
through this is together.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.783
Take 'em to the house.

12:20.783 --> 12:24.047
Go. Go.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.452
Do you want more?

12:37.452 --> 12:39.280
- No, that's good.
- Okay, come on.

12:49.246 --> 12:50.987
Okey-dokey. Here.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.862
Honey, you need
to eat something.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.212
I'm not hungry.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.823
Have this, Jules.

13:00.823 --> 13:01.824
Really good.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.089
Can we go see Victor?

13:08.309 --> 13:09.571
Mom?

13:09.571 --> 13:10.877
Yeah?

13:10.877 --> 13:12.269
Can we go see Victor?

13:12.269 --> 13:13.749
No, honey, not now.

13:13.749 --> 13:16.273
He's been through
a rough few days.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.407
I hope
he's not mad at me.

13:19.407 --> 13:21.844
Why would he
be mad at you?

13:21.844 --> 13:24.586
Me and Jade
were in his room.

13:24.586 --> 13:27.284
He said he was looking for
clues about how to get home.

13:27.284 --> 13:30.026
I told him Victor
wouldn't like it.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.077
Are we gonna be able
to get our stuff back?

13:37.077 --> 13:39.993
Norman's down there.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.821
I don't know, honey.

13:42.865 --> 13:43.866
Eat your food, okay?

13:46.086 --> 13:47.348
Where are you going?

13:47.348 --> 13:49.176
I'll be right back.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.832
Can I-- Can I talk
to you for a second?

13:54.398 --> 13:55.312
Yeah.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.237
You like tea?

14:07.237 --> 14:08.412
Oh, no, no.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.240
Thank you. I'm okay.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.198
Um...

14:14.810 --> 14:16.986
I know you oversee
a lot of the supplies in town,

14:16.986 --> 14:21.208
and I was wondering if maybe
I could go through the storage?

14:21.208 --> 14:24.211
Everything we had
was in that house.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.693
We don't have any supplies
or clothing or--

14:32.480 --> 14:35.309
You come stay our house.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.485
Okay?

14:37.485 --> 14:40.140
Mothers help together.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.275
Thank you.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.973
Thank you so much.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.453
Ya hear about Kristi's fiancée?

14:49.453 --> 14:50.759
I did.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.589
Not sure that's
ever happened before.

14:54.589 --> 14:57.722
So, uh, you know,
what are supplies looking like?

14:58.767 --> 14:59.899
Not good.

15:00.769 --> 15:03.076
Storm wiped out half our crop.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.252
We're gonna have to get
real serious about rations

15:05.252 --> 15:06.383
with all of the new people.

15:08.820 --> 15:12.172
Driver said
there were 25 aboard.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.087
What with the folks in the diner

15:14.087 --> 15:15.697
and the bodies
we found this morning,

15:15.697 --> 15:17.786
we're accounting
for about 22.

15:22.225 --> 15:26.838
Busload of terrified people,
and I fire a fuckin' shotgun.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.321
You were gonna lose
people no matter what,

15:31.321 --> 15:34.281
so let's... focus on
the ones you saved.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.374
You gonna tell me
what happened out there?

15:44.117 --> 15:45.335
Hey, I got another one.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.392
Okay.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.135
Oh, fuck.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.266
Fuck.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.790
Shit.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.923
Can we salvage
that one?

16:07.923 --> 16:11.144
No, there's, um...
I can't find the...

16:13.320 --> 16:15.800
Can you stop with the flowers,
please, and just help?

16:23.417 --> 16:26.550
Listen, man, I, uh...
I get that you're probably

16:26.550 --> 16:28.726
all bent out of shape
about the whole Kristi thing.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.036
Never mind.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.038
It's fine. Uh...

16:36.038 --> 16:40.651
Look, there's a-- there's a--
there's a rod that helps

16:40.651 --> 16:42.262
prop up the traps.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.611
I just-- I don't...

16:43.611 --> 16:44.742
Okay, um--

16:44.742 --> 16:46.222
I must've put the--

16:46.222 --> 16:48.355
<i>♪ Wake up, little Susie,
wake up ♪</i>

16:50.487 --> 16:52.620
<i>♪ Wake up, little Susie,
wake up ♪</i>

16:52.620 --> 16:53.751
What the hell is that?

16:56.493 --> 16:58.930
<i>♪ Wake up,
little Susie and weep ♪</i>

16:58.930 --> 17:01.411
<i>♪ The movie's over,
it's four o'clock ♪</i>

17:01.411 --> 17:03.587
<i>♪ And we're in trouble deep ♪</i>

17:03.587 --> 17:06.373
-<i>♪ Wake up, little Susie ♪</i>
- Jesus.

17:06.373 --> 17:09.028
<i>♪ Wake up, little Susie ♪</i>

17:09.028 --> 17:12.466
<i>♪ Well, what are we
gonna tell your mama?♪</i>

17:12.466 --> 17:14.772
<i>♪ What are we gonna... ♪</i>

17:16.035 --> 17:20.430
Okay, um, we have to bring
her back into town to bury her.

17:20.430 --> 17:23.216
How--
Why would they do that and--

17:23.216 --> 17:26.001
Just put the goddamn
flowers down and help me.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.875
Right, she's, um,
look, she's--

17:30.875 --> 17:32.355
she's pinned to the tree,
so I...

17:39.884 --> 17:41.190
Get Kristi.

17:42.670 --> 17:43.671
Now.

17:43.671 --> 17:44.976
Yeah.

17:44.976 --> 17:45.977
Go!

17:47.936 --> 17:49.372
Help me.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.681
Please help me.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.422
Yeah, it's okay.

17:55.422 --> 17:56.379
It's okay.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.054
No, no.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.099
No, no, no, no, no--

18:20.099 --> 18:21.317
I'm glad you're okay.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.710
What?

18:22.710 --> 18:24.190
I said I'm glad you're okay.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.105
We lost so many people,
I was worried that--

18:26.105 --> 18:28.324
- Who was in my room?
- Sorry?

18:28.324 --> 18:30.457
Someone was in my room,
and they took something.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.720
Oh, um, I think I saw Jade
and the Matthews boy

18:32.720 --> 18:35.288
up here last night. But--

18:35.288 --> 18:36.376
Excuse me.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.802
What? What?!

19:13.500 --> 19:15.589
What?!

19:15.589 --> 19:17.852
Oh, you're back.
Holy shit.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.070
This is great. This is great.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.071
That's mine.

19:22.509 --> 19:23.684
- Ah.
- Give it back to me.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.294
- Yeah. Uh--
- Give it back to me.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.122
- I'm sorry, alright.
- Give it back to me.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.211
I was just thinking I could
just play it for a little bit--

19:29.211 --> 19:31.170
- Give it back to me!
- Okay! Alright.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.606
Calm down, man. Here.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.393
That's my room!

19:39.656 --> 19:41.223
You don't go in my room!

19:41.223 --> 19:42.181
Okay.

19:43.921 --> 19:44.835
Wait! Oh, hold on.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.057
Hey! Slow down! I'm sorry.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.928
Okay? I shouldn't have gone
in your room.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.234
I thought you were fucking dead.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.932
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

19:54.932 --> 19:58.327
There's this symbol
that I keep seeing.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.373
I mean, I keep seeing things
that aren't actually there,

20:00.373 --> 20:02.070
but every time I do,
there's this symbol,

20:02.070 --> 20:04.159
and there's this book
that Kenny's mom gave me.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.683
Some guy kept drawing the same
symbol and there's a picture.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.424
Would you please
just fucking stop!

20:12.950 --> 20:16.650
Look at this. Look at this.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.956
There's gotta be a reason
I'm seeing this everywhere.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.393
This guy.

20:22.003 --> 20:25.441
He must've been
seeing it too. Right?

20:25.441 --> 20:27.965
And look, right there.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.619
Right in the back.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.665
That's you, right?

20:33.754 --> 20:36.060
Maybe in some fucked-up way,

20:36.060 --> 20:38.846
this could be the key to
getting the hell out of here.

20:41.109 --> 20:42.893
I mean, Jesus, all this time.

20:44.852 --> 20:45.896
Don't you wanna go home?

20:50.466 --> 20:52.729
You shouldn't have touched this.

20:52.729 --> 20:55.428
It's not yours.
Stay away from me!

20:58.300 --> 20:59.388
Well, fuck you too!

21:01.216 --> 21:04.175
Wait, uh-- Fuck.

21:17.232 --> 21:18.668
Yeah, the paint got
a little faded.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.718
First few weeks I was here,
I carried it everywhere I went.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.807
I held it when I slept.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.027
Sweaty palms, I guess.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.384
I, um... I like the blonde.

21:39.907 --> 21:40.864
It's a cute look.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.572
I, uh... I know
all this is a lot.

21:54.922 --> 21:58.142
But we can get
through this together.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.883
Hey, sorry--I--

21:59.883 --> 22:03.060
No, it's okay.
It's fine. I just...

22:03.060 --> 22:04.105
Maybe, um...

22:07.195 --> 22:09.719
Maybe I should stay with
the others from the bus.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.550
People died last night,

22:14.550 --> 22:17.510
and that's the rock I painted
for you sitting there

22:17.510 --> 22:19.947
like it was on
your nightstand at home,

22:19.947 --> 22:24.473
and... you're just
acting like everything's...

22:25.561 --> 22:27.128
I just need...

22:29.652 --> 22:30.871
I just need some time.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.394
Kristi!

22:32.394 --> 22:35.266
Are you in here?
It's an emergency!

22:35.266 --> 22:36.920
Uh, coming.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.140
Kristi! Yeah, great.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.750
- What?
- We need your help.

22:40.750 --> 22:41.882
- Okay.
- Now.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.318
- What's going on?
- I gotta go.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.059
I promise we'll talk
as soon as I'm back, okay?

22:45.059 --> 22:46.234
- No--
- Just-- I love you.

22:46.234 --> 22:48.105
Don't do anything
until I leave.

22:48.105 --> 22:49.803
- Kristi--
- I gotta go.

22:49.803 --> 22:50.891
I'm sorry.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.114
It doesn't hurt.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.770
That's weird, right?

23:00.770 --> 23:01.902
Why doesn't it hurt?

23:05.819 --> 23:06.907
Are you still there?

23:08.517 --> 23:09.475
Yeah.

23:10.563 --> 23:11.738
Yeah. I'm still here.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.654
What's your name?

23:16.699 --> 23:17.831
I'm Ellis.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.008
Cool name.

23:22.357 --> 23:23.663
I'm Kelly.

23:23.663 --> 23:24.838
Hi. Hi, Kelly.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.669
Um...

23:29.669 --> 23:31.061
where are we?

23:32.498 --> 23:34.325
We're, uh...

23:34.325 --> 23:36.632
We're in the woods.

23:36.632 --> 23:37.938
Just outside town.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.419
The woods.

23:41.768 --> 23:42.682
How?

23:47.121 --> 23:48.122
Oh, God.

23:50.298 --> 23:51.299
We were in the bar.

23:59.263 --> 24:01.135
These people came in. They...

24:06.575 --> 24:08.534
Brian was screaming.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.840
It's okay. It's okay.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.538
No. No.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.105
No, you don't understand.
They--

24:15.105 --> 24:16.455
They dragged us out. They...

24:18.718 --> 24:20.720
made me watch.

24:23.940 --> 24:28.205
They said they wanted to...
play with me.

24:28.205 --> 24:30.904
What-- What the f--

24:30.904 --> 24:32.427
Hey, hey.

24:32.427 --> 24:34.777
'Kay, uh, the doctor's here.

24:34.777 --> 24:38.346
She's gonna take
care of you, okay?

24:38.346 --> 24:39.478
Hi.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.959
I'm Kristi.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.744
I'm just gonna take
a look at you, okay?

24:44.744 --> 24:45.832
Okay.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.183
Is it bad?

24:50.271 --> 24:51.315
It's bad.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.752
- Oh, God.
- Hey.

24:52.752 --> 24:53.796
It's bad.

24:53.796 --> 24:56.059
Hey.
Take my hand.

24:56.059 --> 24:58.192
Squeeze it as hard
as you like.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.759
And I'm gonna
take a look, okay?

24:59.759 --> 25:02.718
Squeeze. Squeeze.

25:02.718 --> 25:03.676
Good.

26:12.832 --> 26:15.878
Oh, am I
interrupting something?

26:15.878 --> 26:18.011
I was looking
for the doctor.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.579
I think her name
is Kristi.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.406
Uh...

26:22.406 --> 26:24.844
She had to run out.

26:24.844 --> 26:28.021
Can I, uh...
Can I help you with something?

26:28.021 --> 26:32.765
You're the fella that
got stuck under the house.

26:32.765 --> 26:35.028
Yeah.

26:35.028 --> 26:38.248
That boy from the bus
that got stuck with you?

26:38.248 --> 26:41.338
He sat across
the aisle from me.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.344
I'll let you get back to...

26:50.260 --> 26:51.479
Where were you headed?

26:53.960 --> 26:55.135
You were on a bus.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.486
Where were you going?

26:58.486 --> 26:59.443
Oh.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.926
The racetrack.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.189
I was gonna bet on the ponies.

27:06.189 --> 27:09.279
I've been visiting racetracks
all across the country.

27:09.279 --> 27:11.238
Was it a charter bus?

27:11.238 --> 27:13.936
Uh, I don't know.
It was a bus.

27:13.936 --> 27:16.939
It had wheels and a door
and tickets you had to buy.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.288
What's in the bag?

27:18.288 --> 27:20.203
Oh.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.945
You ask a lot of questions.

27:24.468 --> 27:25.861
I just have one more.

27:29.212 --> 27:31.084
Uh, we need
a little help in here!

27:33.739 --> 27:35.175
Hey.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.567
Hey, you're supposed
to be in bed.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.570
Who the hell are you?

27:39.570 --> 27:42.312
My name's Marielle.
I'm a nurse.

27:42.312 --> 27:43.705
Let's get you
off the floor, okay?

27:43.705 --> 27:44.837
- Yeah.
- Come on.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.536
Okay, there we go.

27:48.536 --> 27:51.539
Little sore.

27:51.539 --> 27:52.975
'Kay, I'm gonna see
if I can find you

27:52.975 --> 27:54.977
an aspirin or something.
Excuse me.

27:54.977 --> 27:57.066
- I'll stay with him.
- Thank you.

27:58.502 --> 27:59.852
You okay?

28:00.896 --> 28:01.854
Oh.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.858
Can you imagine?

28:05.858 --> 28:07.860
Showing up in a place like this

28:07.860 --> 28:10.297
to find out that
your fiancée is here?

28:10.297 --> 28:12.473
What did you say?

28:13.996 --> 28:16.259
Well, Kristi and Marielle.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.826
They're engaged.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.266
You're my what?

28:23.266 --> 28:24.920
Your proxy.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.227
It's uh, something we normally
do on the first night,

28:27.227 --> 28:29.490
but things happened a little
differently this time.

28:29.490 --> 28:33.494
So, if you have any questions
or if there's anything I can do

28:33.494 --> 28:35.061
to make things a little--

28:35.061 --> 28:37.759
How long have you been here?

28:37.759 --> 28:40.936
Uh, just had
my one-year anniversary.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.459
It was, um--

28:46.159 --> 28:47.290
You good?

28:48.422 --> 28:51.338
Is there water nearby?

28:51.338 --> 28:54.341
Like a...
a lake or a pond?

28:56.169 --> 28:59.215
Uh, yeah, I mean,
we have this place called

28:59.215 --> 29:01.478
the Brundles not far from here.

29:01.478 --> 29:02.915
Can I see it?

29:02.915 --> 29:04.525
Here it is.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.050
Closest thing to
normal fun we have here.

29:10.357 --> 29:11.750
Why do they
call it the Brundles?

29:14.187 --> 29:16.580
Uh, it was just called
that when I got here.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.366
How did you know about--

29:19.366 --> 29:20.410
I saw it.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.328
Were you the one on
the bus that had the dream?

29:29.680 --> 29:31.944
Yeah, those happen sometimes.

29:31.944 --> 29:35.077
People have all sorts of
strange reactions to this place.

29:36.252 --> 29:40.953
Dreams, nightmares,
weird premonitions.

29:40.953 --> 29:43.825
But we don't know why
or what it means.

29:43.825 --> 29:47.437
Why it happens to some people
and not to others.

29:47.437 --> 29:50.963
This one girl, Nadia,
she used to say that it was

29:50.963 --> 29:53.835
like this place was
calling out to us,

29:53.835 --> 29:55.837
but only some of us were
listening closely enough

29:55.837 --> 29:56.838
to hear it.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.536
But has anyone--

29:59.536 --> 30:00.929
Yes.

30:00.929 --> 30:04.541
People have obsessed
over these things.

30:04.541 --> 30:07.327
They've compared
and picked it apart.

30:07.327 --> 30:10.069
It didn't tell us anything
we didn't already know.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.287
Which is what?

30:14.377 --> 30:15.465
That we're stuck.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.555
And nobody can tell us why.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.737
So?

30:26.737 --> 30:28.565
Well, I mean,
even if we were in a hospital,

30:28.565 --> 30:31.830
this would be at least
a 15-hour operation.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.529
But she's talking.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.879
I mean, she's literally
sitting there and talking.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.315
Yeah, I know.

30:39.315 --> 30:42.579
But, uh, how long
can she be here?

30:44.146 --> 30:47.323
Uh, I mean, it could be hours.
It could be days.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.412
I-- She's not
suffering right now,

30:49.412 --> 30:51.371
but I don't know how
long that's gonna last.

30:51.371 --> 30:52.807
Those things,
they'll be back tonight.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.591
Okay, so then we have
to get her out of here.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.028
Look, I don't
think you understand.

30:56.028 --> 30:58.857
I mean, it's a miracle
she's even still alive.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.772
So then, what do we do?

31:10.085 --> 31:11.260
How do we, um...

31:13.132 --> 31:14.611
How do we do it?

31:14.611 --> 31:16.613
Do you have something
in your bag that might--

31:16.613 --> 31:18.441
No, nothing that
would be strong enough.

31:23.446 --> 31:24.926
We have to pull out the rod.

31:26.145 --> 31:29.670
Okay. Will it, uh...

31:29.670 --> 31:31.672
Will it be peaceful?

31:31.672 --> 31:32.934
I don't know.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.285
Look, there's...

31:37.852 --> 31:40.420
there is one more option.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.597
No. No.

31:43.597 --> 31:47.688
I'm not having her last moments
be with a gun to her head, okay?

31:47.688 --> 31:49.385
Kristi?

31:51.344 --> 31:52.432
Hey.

31:53.563 --> 31:55.870
I'm right here.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.482
I'm not okay, am I?

32:01.658 --> 32:02.746
No.

32:05.401 --> 32:06.794
No, you're not.

32:11.233 --> 32:12.408
Am I gonna die?

32:20.503 --> 32:21.417
Yeah.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.996
These are for Dad.

32:34.996 --> 32:38.173
Mom, this has a huge hole
in it.

32:38.173 --> 32:41.785
So? If it fits, it goes.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.744
Oh, just like this one. Perfect.

32:48.705 --> 32:50.533
So how come Ethan gets
to spend the afternoon

32:50.533 --> 32:52.013
looking through
toys with Mrs. Liu

32:52.013 --> 32:53.580
and I get stuck doing this?

32:53.580 --> 32:55.712
Oh, honey, I'm sorry,
do you want to play with toys?

32:56.844 --> 32:58.193
Come on, Julie.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.890
This is what being
an adult looks like.

33:01.544 --> 33:02.545
Hm.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.374
Oh.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.769
Look at this.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.205
Try this on.

33:12.294 --> 33:14.557
This is so creepy.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.430
All this stuff has
belonged to people who've...

33:17.430 --> 33:18.735
What?

33:18.735 --> 33:20.433
It's no different
than a thrift store.

33:21.825 --> 33:23.001
It's a little different.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.046
It fits you. Perfect.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.222
So are we living with
Kenny and his mom now?

33:27.222 --> 33:29.181
And Jade?

33:29.181 --> 33:30.878
Well, just for now.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.923
You know, once your dad's
back on his feet,

33:32.923 --> 33:34.012
then we can start look--

33:37.406 --> 33:39.234
Mom?

33:39.234 --> 33:40.496
Mom, what's wrong?

33:42.498 --> 33:43.673
What's wrong?

33:43.673 --> 33:44.805
Nothing.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.068
Mom, what happened
just now?

33:47.068 --> 33:48.591
- What's going on?
- Wait.

33:48.591 --> 33:51.029
I don't know.
Nothing. Let's go home.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.726
- What?
- Let's go home.

33:52.726 --> 33:53.944
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

34:00.690 --> 34:01.691
Hey, babe.

34:05.217 --> 34:09.308
I'm back a little
sooner than expected.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.094
That big swing we talked about?

34:16.315 --> 34:17.968
It didn't go quite
the way I'd planned.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.103
But I got some news. Uh...

34:23.800 --> 34:25.063
Somebody's getting married.

34:27.152 --> 34:30.459
Maybe you already knew that.

34:32.809 --> 34:33.723
Or maybe...

34:43.255 --> 34:45.387
Maybe none of this is real.

34:48.564 --> 34:50.914
Maybe you and Ellis are
sittin' by a hospital bed

34:50.914 --> 34:55.528
waiting for me
to open my eyes up.

34:55.528 --> 34:58.313
Just open your eyes up! Op--

34:58.313 --> 35:00.446
I mean, how could a--

35:00.446 --> 35:03.405
How could a man that's
chained to a wall in a place

35:03.405 --> 35:05.668
that's not there
know your name?

35:05.668 --> 35:08.018
How can that be real?

35:08.018 --> 35:09.194
That-- How can--

35:17.419 --> 35:19.943
Mom, what happened back there?

35:19.943 --> 35:22.511
Nothing. I'm fine.

35:22.511 --> 35:23.512
Mom.

35:23.512 --> 35:25.688
What?! I'm fine.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.908
You know, why don't you
take these upstairs, please.

35:27.908 --> 35:29.431
Mom, talk to me!

35:32.869 --> 35:34.306
Do you know what I spent
the whole night

35:34.306 --> 35:36.743
thinking about in that diner?

35:36.743 --> 35:39.485
How I was gonna have to
take care of Ethan by myself,

35:39.485 --> 35:41.704
'cause I thought you were dead.

35:41.704 --> 35:43.837
And I sat there waiting
for those things to find Dad

35:43.837 --> 35:45.752
and rip him apart.

35:45.752 --> 35:48.146
So don't tell me you're fine,
and don't tell me it's nothing.

35:52.454 --> 35:53.673
Yes, I saw something.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.677
Something that wasn't there.

35:59.374 --> 36:02.290
It's not the first
time that's happened.

36:04.292 --> 36:05.424
What do you mean?

36:11.995 --> 36:14.476
After Thomas died,

36:14.476 --> 36:17.871
for months I could
still hear him crying.

36:20.569 --> 36:24.530
Sometimes I would
even go into a room,

36:24.530 --> 36:25.792
and I would see him there.

36:27.663 --> 36:31.058
Just for a second.
It always felt so peaceful.

36:34.453 --> 36:36.629
Like he was letting me
know he was okay.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.328
So that's what
happened just now?

36:41.590 --> 36:43.157
You saw Thomas?

36:43.157 --> 36:46.029
No. No, no.

36:46.029 --> 36:49.772
No, this... this was different.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.473
I saw two children

36:54.473 --> 36:57.084
standing in the middle
of the road staring at me.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.479
But this...

37:00.479 --> 37:01.436
What?

37:06.180 --> 37:07.355
It didn't feel peaceful.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.230
Is Ellis still there?

37:17.409 --> 37:18.584
Hi.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.283
Yeah, I'm still here.

37:23.458 --> 37:26.635
And, um,
who's the other boy?

37:26.635 --> 37:29.290
Oh, that's, uh...
that's Kenny.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.423
He's our deputy.

37:31.423 --> 37:32.467
Hi, Kenny.

37:32.467 --> 37:34.382
Hi.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.430
You're all so nice.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.956
Um, can you get
my phone, please?

37:43.957 --> 37:45.567
I have to call my mom.
I have to tell her--

37:45.567 --> 37:48.440
Um, yeah, the, uh,
the phones here,

37:48.440 --> 37:50.137
they... they don't really work.

37:51.834 --> 37:54.097
But, uh, we can...
we can write you a note.

37:54.097 --> 37:57.710
I've got some paper
in-in my bag.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.581
You, uh... you just
tell us what you wanna say,

37:59.581 --> 38:01.148
and we'll write it
down for you, okay?

38:02.584 --> 38:03.846
You'll make sure she gets it?

38:04.891 --> 38:05.848
Yeah.

38:07.937 --> 38:08.982
I guess that'd be okay.

38:11.114 --> 38:12.115
Whenever you're ready.

38:15.467 --> 38:18.774
Um, tell her, um...

38:20.298 --> 38:21.473
Tell her that I love her.

38:25.390 --> 38:28.175
And I'm sorry
I didn't give her a hug.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.875
Um, she wanted one,
but I was mad when I left so...

38:34.921 --> 38:36.618
It was so stupid.

38:38.098 --> 38:39.969
We had this fight
about Brian, um...

38:41.580 --> 38:44.147
And I...

38:44.147 --> 38:47.194
I didn't give her a hug,
so tell her that I'm sorry.

38:47.194 --> 38:48.587
And, um...

38:52.547 --> 38:53.679
What is that?

38:53.679 --> 38:54.636
Hey.

38:55.985 --> 38:57.073
Kelly, what's wrong?

38:57.073 --> 38:58.901
Do you hear that? It's--

38:58.901 --> 38:59.946
Kelly! Hey!

39:03.645 --> 39:05.517
Hey, what's happening, Kristi?

39:05.517 --> 39:07.693
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.782
The longer we wait,
the more she'll suffer, okay?

39:09.782 --> 39:10.870
Okay. Alright. I'll do it.

39:10.870 --> 39:12.088
It's my job.

39:12.088 --> 39:13.176
Hello! Hello?

39:13.176 --> 39:16.441
Hey, hey! I heard screams.

39:16.441 --> 39:17.398
She's--

39:19.444 --> 39:21.924
She's from the bus.

39:21.924 --> 39:23.622
They left her like that.

39:25.711 --> 39:28.409
Kristi. Kenny. Come.

39:28.409 --> 39:29.367
Come.

39:30.759 --> 39:31.891
You all go back
to town now, okay?

39:31.891 --> 39:33.109
What?

39:33.109 --> 39:34.546
You don't need to
be here for this.

39:34.546 --> 39:37.418
- All due respect, Sheriff--
- Kristi, I'm not asking.

39:37.418 --> 39:38.941
I'm not leaving, okay?

39:45.731 --> 39:47.559
Alright, alright, alright.
What's her name?

39:47.559 --> 39:48.995
- What's her name?
- It's Kelly.

39:48.995 --> 39:50.562
Hey, Kelly?

39:50.562 --> 39:51.824
I can't!

39:51.824 --> 39:54.087
I'm so-- No!

39:54.087 --> 39:55.262
Okay.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.306
You squeeze
my hand, okay?

39:56.306 --> 39:58.265
Alright.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.096
Okay, Kelly, just squeeze.

40:03.096 --> 40:04.706
Good.

40:04.706 --> 40:06.882
Keep squeezing.

40:22.507 --> 40:23.943
Marielle?

40:28.904 --> 40:31.951
Hey.
Everything okay?

40:31.951 --> 40:33.866
Please stay.

40:35.607 --> 40:36.521
Kristi.

40:38.740 --> 40:39.872
Baby, what--

40:39.872 --> 40:41.830
I just need
you to stay.

40:41.830 --> 40:42.831
Baby, what--

40:42.831 --> 40:45.007
I just need you to stay.

40:45.007 --> 40:47.488
Hey.

40:47.488 --> 40:48.446
Come here.

40:50.099 --> 40:51.057
Come here.

40:55.670 --> 40:58.847
Hey, it's okay.

41:12.426 --> 41:14.994
I'm gonna...

41:14.994 --> 41:16.604
I'm gonna head
over to the church.

41:16.604 --> 41:19.041
I told Donna I'd look
through the stuff

41:19.041 --> 41:20.565
that Father Khatri had,

41:20.565 --> 41:22.871
see if there's something
we can read at the service.

41:22.871 --> 41:23.916
- Yeah.
- So.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.440
Kenny.

41:28.529 --> 41:29.617
Yeah?

41:31.924 --> 41:33.099
It's those things.

41:35.318 --> 41:36.363
They did this.

42:02.258 --> 42:03.259
Hey.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.871
Hey.

42:05.871 --> 42:08.613
I've, uh,
been looking for you.

42:08.613 --> 42:10.440
Sorry, I was just, um...

42:20.450 --> 42:22.714
Promise me it won't
always be this way.

42:26.065 --> 42:28.284
You can lie if you have to.
Just please...

42:31.287 --> 42:32.201
promise me.

42:37.598 --> 42:38.860
Let's get married.

42:39.992 --> 42:41.210
What?

42:41.210 --> 42:44.605
Look, I know that
we said we'd wait,

42:44.605 --> 42:47.477
and, you know, that we'd
do it when we got back home,

42:47.477 --> 42:50.785
but I... you know what?
I don't wanna wait.

42:50.785 --> 42:53.614
I don't wanna let this place
be the thing that decides

42:53.614 --> 42:55.007
when we get to be happy.

42:57.313 --> 42:58.445
So let's do it.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.579
Let's get married.

43:06.627 --> 43:08.150
Okay.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.282
Okay?

43:14.200 --> 43:15.636
We're getting married.

43:17.116 --> 43:19.640
Okay! Okay.

43:19.640 --> 43:23.818
We're getting--
We're getting married!

43:30.346 --> 43:32.958
Hey.
Is that from Ms. Liu?

43:32.958 --> 43:35.221
It was in
the storage closet.

43:35.221 --> 43:37.702
She said I could have it.

43:37.702 --> 43:38.833
It's a puzzle.

43:40.618 --> 43:41.619
It's so cool.

43:44.709 --> 43:47.755
Um, I want to talk to
you about something.

43:47.755 --> 43:48.800
Um...

43:51.237 --> 43:54.240
I know how much you like
to see everything like a--

43:54.240 --> 43:56.808
like a challenge or a quest.

43:56.808 --> 43:58.287
But I just wanted
you to realize--

43:58.287 --> 44:00.246
I know it's dangerous here.

44:00.246 --> 44:02.509
I know it's not like things
are all just make-believe,

44:02.509 --> 44:04.380
and I promise I'll be careful.

44:07.035 --> 44:08.036
Good.

44:12.693 --> 44:13.651
Hey.

44:16.262 --> 44:17.480
I think I got it.

44:21.310 --> 44:22.268
Cool, huh?

44:33.888 --> 44:35.629
- Oh, my God. Stand up.
- What's wrong?

44:35.629 --> 44:37.239
- Stand up right now. Right now.
- What's wrong?

44:37.239 --> 44:39.067
Let's go. Get in.

44:39.067 --> 44:41.548
Get in, get in, get in.

44:49.948 --> 44:51.210
Oh, fuck!

44:52.777 --> 44:53.691
Fuck!

45:00.219 --> 45:02.221
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:06.094 --> 45:08.227
Looks like you're
having a shit day too.

45:09.271 --> 45:10.229
Yeah.

45:11.970 --> 45:16.496
There was this, uh, girl
from the bus out in the forest.

45:16.496 --> 45:18.454
Kelly.

45:18.454 --> 45:20.108
Those things
dragged her out there,

45:20.108 --> 45:24.156
and, uh, they took a metal
rod from one of the traps.

45:25.244 --> 45:27.507
They stuck it right in
her head and into a tree.

45:28.682 --> 45:29.727
Kid was still alive.

45:31.119 --> 45:33.078
- Did you have to--
- Yeah.

45:34.340 --> 45:36.429
I'm sorry, Boyd.

45:37.604 --> 45:39.998
Ellis said she was traveling
with her boyfriend, Brian?

45:41.564 --> 45:42.783
Those things got him.

45:44.524 --> 45:48.484
Said they... made her watch
what they did to him.

45:49.834 --> 45:51.966
Jesus Christ.

45:51.966 --> 45:55.883
Funny thing, though.

45:55.883 --> 45:57.798
My first tour in Iraq,
I was, uh...

46:01.019 --> 46:03.151
I was driving with
a few guys from my unit

46:03.151 --> 46:05.763
back to our command center.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.982
We drove over an IED.

46:09.070 --> 46:10.898
Standard-issue jeep.

46:10.898 --> 46:13.596
The fucking thing
blew right through it.

46:13.596 --> 46:16.817
First two guys,
dead on impact,

46:16.817 --> 46:18.688
but there was
this kid from Wisconsin,

46:18.688 --> 46:20.778
we used to call him Smuckers

46:20.778 --> 46:23.868
'cause the kid
fucking loved jelly.

46:25.695 --> 46:28.437
Anyway, the shrapnel
from the IED, right,

46:28.437 --> 46:31.266
ripped right through.

46:36.576 --> 46:37.795
He died in my arms.

46:40.536 --> 46:41.755
He was crying.

46:43.235 --> 46:44.279
Begging.

46:47.674 --> 46:49.589
First time I ever
watched someone die.

46:53.288 --> 46:55.638
Corporal Brian Kelly.

46:59.381 --> 47:00.905
How about that?

47:00.905 --> 47:05.039
That's a... that's a pretty
big fucking coincidence,

47:05.039 --> 47:07.172
don't you think?

47:07.172 --> 47:09.087
Brian Kelly. J--

47:09.087 --> 47:10.740
Boyd, that's--

47:10.740 --> 47:14.919
No, no, no. I killed a kid,
and instead of mourning,

47:14.919 --> 47:18.618
I'm standing here trying to
figure out how any of this

47:18.618 --> 47:20.185
shit can be fucking real!

47:24.189 --> 47:28.802
Boyd, what happened
in the forest?

47:33.676 --> 47:35.200
I gotta go.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.680
Nah! No, no, no!
You do not get to walk in here

47:37.680 --> 47:39.073
and dump a load
of shit like that

47:39.073 --> 47:40.988
and then just walk away!

47:40.988 --> 47:42.511
You don't wanna tell me? Fine.

47:42.511 --> 47:43.948
You talk when
you feel like talking.

47:43.948 --> 47:45.601
Okay.

47:45.601 --> 47:48.300
I just need to know
that you got your shit together.

47:52.782 --> 47:54.262
I tried doing what you do, okay?

47:54.262 --> 47:56.221
And I just got a bunch
of fucking people killed.

47:56.221 --> 47:57.526
Donna--

47:57.526 --> 47:58.876
No, I don't need
a goddamn pep talk!

47:58.876 --> 48:01.182
I just need to know
that you're back!

48:04.359 --> 48:07.275
Because these people can't
take a whole lot more of this.

48:12.106 --> 48:13.107
Fuck.

48:16.154 --> 48:18.112
I'm not sure how much
more I can take.

48:19.766 --> 48:20.680
Okay.

48:22.551 --> 48:23.596
Okay.

49:03.331 --> 49:04.419
Hello?

49:07.596 --> 49:08.510
Hello?

49:14.342 --> 49:15.517
Someone down here?

49:42.066 --> 49:43.415
Hi, Kenny.
