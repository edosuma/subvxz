WEBVTT

00:21.146 --> 00:23.357
Glad tidings, Lady Peony.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.025
I see you've got a new bonnet.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.361
Admiral Tansy.

00:27.444 --> 00:31.740
You've returned from your long journey
to the underworld victorious.

00:32.533 --> 00:36.703
Sweet Iris, in such an elegant gown.

00:40.290 --> 00:44.503
There are my bumblebees, booked and busy.

00:48.966 --> 00:52.052
Honestly, who needs parties
when you have a garden?

00:52.135 --> 00:54.888
This right here is the social event
of the season.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.524
Working hard or hardly working?

01:06.525 --> 01:09.987
Death. What are you doing in my garden?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.573
I had to come check you out.
Show you my new fit.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.910
Damn. You are all spruced up.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.455
Yeah, I got my shit together.
I was down bad last time we talked.

01:20.539 --> 01:21.790
I'm good now though.

01:21.874 --> 01:24.168
What happened? Did you get some rest, or--

01:24.251 --> 01:26.086
You know workaholics don't take
no vacations.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.631
But I did think about things
a little bit differently.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.508
Just had to change my perspective.
That's all.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.720
Wow. Okay. Well, fill me in.

01:35.554 --> 01:38.765
Well, I felt like
I was kinda being hard on myself.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.020
It's like I'm that dude
that nobody ever wants to see.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.607
People really don't like the idea
of laying in the dirt

01:46.690 --> 01:48.317
with worms coming outta their face.

01:48.901 --> 01:49.902
No, they don't.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.697
But then I started to think.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.659
Without death, what is life?

01:57.743 --> 02:00.204
It's all one process.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.955
It's like these flowers.

02:02.039 --> 02:05.334
They grow in soil,
and that's basically waste.

02:05.417 --> 02:09.545
Then they bloom and eventually rot
and just become more dirt.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.591
And the same thing happens over and over.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.552
It's a cycle, baby.
Bitches gotta deal with that.

02:15.636 --> 02:19.306
Right. Well, I'm really glad
you're feeling better.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.767
This suit is fire.

02:21.850 --> 02:27.022
Yeah. I was kinda thinking
you could use a new look yourself.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.315
What's wrong with how I look?

02:28.398 --> 02:30.859
It's not about how you look.
It's how you feel.

02:31.443 --> 02:34.363
You gotta wear something
that makes you feel like yourself.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.574
Your clothes are supposed to make you feel
like the one, not the two.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.828
You can't be walking around all hemmed up
by everybody else's expectations.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.956
You got work to do, Ms. Dickinson.

02:44.039 --> 02:48.377
You got all of these unreleased poems,
hundreds of them, the greatest poems ever.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.671
And you're on a bit of a deadline too.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.091
I don't know if you're gonna be able
to work fast enough dressed like that.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.677
So, what do you--

02:56.760 --> 02:59.137
What do you think I should wear?
A suit like yours?

02:59.221 --> 03:00.806
I can't tell you that.

03:00.889 --> 03:04.643
You gotta ask yourself,
"What's gonna work for me?

03:04.726 --> 03:08.063
What's gonna make me go deeper
than I've ever gone before?

03:08.146 --> 03:11.108
Go farther than I ever traveled?"

03:14.945 --> 03:17.948
You got work to do, Ms. Dickinson.
You gonna need a uniform.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.332
You know,
I do feel like this dress is pretty stiff.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.002
I'd love something more flexible.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.212
Get what you need, Emily.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.965
Be who you are, 'cause time's moving fast.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.758
You got poems to write.

04:42.074 --> 04:46.453
Demonic-- Devil's buttons.

04:47.246 --> 04:48.247
Come on.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.874
Vinnie!

04:52.584 --> 04:55.587
-Yes?
-I can't get this stupid dress off.

04:55.671 --> 04:56.922
Can you come unbutton me?

04:57.005 --> 04:59.258
Why are you getting undressed?
It's the middle of the day.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.301
Because I need to get some writing done,

05:01.385 --> 05:03.595
and this corset is so tight
I can't breathe.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.764
Well, I hope you don't have any visitors.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.349
Who ever comes to visit me?

05:07.432 --> 05:08.433
There.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.812
The way women dress these days is idiotic.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.565
We should be able to get in and out
of our clothing by ourselves.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.025
It's, like, a baseline requirement
for being an adult.

05:17.109 --> 05:20.863
Emily Dickinson, how dare you question
the shape of a lady's silhouette?

05:21.780 --> 05:25.701
Inspiration means inhalation.
Do you realize that?

05:25.784 --> 05:28.370
To be inspired,
you have to be able to breathe.

05:28.453 --> 05:32.499
I want to be able to sit at my desk
and fully inflate my lungs.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.376
Okay, you crazy for that one.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.379
-I just don't wanna wear a corset.
-Well, we all have dreams.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.511
I can feel the blood flowing,
the blood and the poetry.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.972
Nothing can stop you from writing, can it?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.099
Nothing's stopped me yet.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.642
And God knows people have tried.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.937
They can't stop me from writing, Vinnie.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.398
Because writing is the thing
that keeps me alive.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.693
Well, I will always be here for that.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.278
Go.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.335
Look at us, a happy family.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.213
Not all happy families are alike.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.351
All right.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.189
Well…

06:39.399 --> 06:40.984
Look who it is.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.569
We weren't expecting guests.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.239
Mother, Father…

06:47.282 --> 06:48.784
we're here to make peace.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.245
I was never at war with you
in the first place.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.581
Is that my grandson in there?

06:54.665 --> 06:55.582
It is.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.626
Well then, come inside at once.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.921
It's time this nameless little heathen
got to know his Grandma Cookie.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.970
So, have you chosen a name yet?

07:08.637 --> 07:10.889
-Almost.
-Dear God, what is the delay?

07:10.973 --> 07:13.976
-We'd like to give him a family name.
-Well, that's right and proper.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.770
But before we can do that, we need to know
what kind of family we have.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.523
What on earth does that mean?

07:19.606 --> 07:23.402
Father, there's a matter
I'd like to discuss with you.

07:23.485 --> 07:27.531
A new legal case has come to my attention,
and if it interests you,

07:27.614 --> 07:30.325
perhaps we could take it on together.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.703
I thought you started your own firm.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.664
This case will require my full energy

07:35.747 --> 07:38.959
but in addition, your level of expertise.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.212
I see.

07:43.005 --> 07:43.839
Go on.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.300
What's the situation?

07:46.383 --> 07:50.012
There's a young, freeborn Black woman
named Angeline Palmer.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.931
She worked as a servant here in town
for the Shaw family.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.183
We know the Shaws.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.768
-Yes, yes. Respectable people.
-Not exactly.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.898
See, the Shaw family hatched a scheme

08:00.981 --> 08:05.444
to sell Angeline into slavery
in Georgia for $600.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.363
Angeline's brothers saved her

08:08.447 --> 08:11.366
by smuggling her out of the house
before the Shaws left town,

08:11.450 --> 08:15.537
but they were caught,
charged with kidnapping and assault.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.082
These men are sitting in jail right now,

08:19.166 --> 08:21.668
and they would deeply welcome
our representation.

08:21.752 --> 08:25.339
This is messy business.
The Shaws are well-connected.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.884
I mean, why do we want to draw
this kind of attention

08:28.967 --> 08:30.135
to the Dickinson name?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.804
That is exactly why
we ought to take this case.

08:33.388 --> 08:37.808
Let's face it, Dad. The Dickinson name
isn't doing so well right now.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.897
Between your stodgy Whiggishness
and my, well…

08:42.940 --> 08:44.191
weaknesses,

08:44.942 --> 08:47.110
you and I haven't had the best year.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.822
Taking this case would give a new meaning
to the name "Dickinson."

08:50.906 --> 08:53.825
It would mean
that we stood for what was right.

08:56.537 --> 09:00.499
Knit one, purl two.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.792
What's that you're knitting?

09:01.875 --> 09:06.088
-You'll see. Everyone will see.
-See what?

09:06.171 --> 09:09.424
Epic yarn bomb incoming.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.637
Good morning. Beautiful day out there.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.721
Isn't it though?

09:14.805 --> 09:17.307
I've got a spring in me step
from this nice weather.

09:17.391 --> 09:21.019
The birds and the bees, you know?
The pollen, the nectar.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.688
Makes me feel a bit wild.

09:22.771 --> 09:26.191
I'd love for some dashing gentleman
to come whisk me off for a frolic.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.026
Okay, Maggie's horny.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.863
I'm looking for Emily. Is she in?

09:30.946 --> 09:34.324
-She's upstairs, writing.
-Have you got something for her?

09:34.408 --> 09:36.952
If she's writing,
I don't wanna disturb her.

09:37.035 --> 09:41.707
She's always writing, or thinking.
Emily has to think.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.501
She's the only one of us
who has that to do.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.920
Go on up. She'll be happy to see you.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.716
Knit one…

09:52.426 --> 09:53.844
purl two.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.018
My Wars are laid away in Books --

10:03.520 --> 10:04.521
Who is it?

10:06.815 --> 10:08.025
Betty. Come in.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.027
I know you're busy.

10:10.110 --> 10:14.781
It's all right. Is something wrong?
You didn't get word from Henry, did you?

10:14.865 --> 10:18.035
No, nothing from Henry.
I've just about given up on that.

10:18.118 --> 10:22.497
Betty, I'm so sorry.
I wish there was something I could do.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.125
No, listen. That's why I'm here.

10:25.209 --> 10:29.588
Because you've been trying to help me,
and I was too hard on you.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.924
All you were trying to do
was give me hope.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.843
And there's nothing wrong with that,
nothing at all.

10:34.927 --> 10:38.263
The world could use more people trying
to do that for each other.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.518
I don't know, Austin.

10:42.601 --> 10:46.813
I've already accepted that my legacy
won't lie in politics.

10:47.856 --> 10:53.445
My true legacy are the people right here,
my family, my children.

10:54.071 --> 10:57.741
Well, then think of your children.
Angeline was 11 years old.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.409
Think of Emily at that age.

10:59.493 --> 11:03.872
They tried to sell her
to a stranger for $600.

11:05.374 --> 11:06.875
You really care about this, don't you?

11:06.959 --> 11:10.921
Yes. It's time for things to change.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.966
Seasons change, and so do societies.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.593
And we can either be
a part of the new world,

11:17.177 --> 11:18.762
or we can crumble to dust.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.723
We'll take the case.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.440
Wonderful.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.235
I was afraid you were going to announce
you're moving to Nebraska.

11:33.318 --> 11:37.990
No. No, he'll stay here in Amherst
and see if he can make it a better place.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.033
-Would you pass him back to me?
-No. No.

11:40.117 --> 11:43.579
So, there's actually something
I could use your help with.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.122
What's that?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.082
I want to make a new dress.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.670
I'm a little backed up with orders
at the shop--

11:51.753 --> 11:54.214
No, I don't want you to make it for me.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.465
I wanna make it myself.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.009
-Yourself?
-Yes.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.094
I know I'm not good at sewing,

11:59.803 --> 12:02.556
but it's really important
that I do this for myself.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.392
A dress I can write in.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.686
A dress I can live in.

12:08.979 --> 12:13.400
So, I could really use
your expert consultation,

12:14.401 --> 12:17.821
because I'm not sure that a dress
quite like this has ever existed before.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.283
Well, I'd be happy to help.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.953
I love the challenge of a new design.

12:25.037 --> 12:26.246
Great.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.790
Pull up a chair.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.878
Before the girls take the baby away,
will you tell us the name?

12:33.462 --> 12:36.173
Well, yes. I suppose we can.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.550
Sue, would you like to do the honors?

12:38.634 --> 12:40.469
-How about Sir Poopsalot?
-Accurate.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.763
We're all ears.
What do we call this little fellow?

12:43.347 --> 12:47.893
Well, Austin and I have decided…

12:52.272 --> 12:53.607
-What--
-No, go on. Say it.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.526
-Who can that be?
-There's somebody at the door.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.570
Coming!

13:05.285 --> 13:06.495
Faith and begorra,

13:06.578 --> 13:09.915
what is this fine specimen of a man
that I do see before me?

13:09.998 --> 13:12.417
My name is
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.753
I'm here to see the great poet,
Emily Dickinson.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.680
-What is it?
-…the name at a different time.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.807
There's a visitor here for Emily.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.016
Emily? Who is it?

13:28.100 --> 13:32.229
An army man, a high-ranking officer,
handsome as anything.

13:32.312 --> 13:36.900
His name is
Wintwig Hansworth Tompton Popcorn.

13:36.984 --> 13:40.070
-Maggie, are you having a stroke?
-Say it slowly, Maggie.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.739
Hemsworth Wiggleston Tenterhooks.

13:42.823 --> 13:43.824
What?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.328
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.165
Your daughter, Emily Dickinson, is my…

13:55.252 --> 13:56.670
unseen correspondent.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.631
Correspondent? You mean--

13:59.715 --> 14:01.842
-She's been writing to you?
-Yes.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.887
Many letters and poems.

14:05.721 --> 14:07.264
Such extraordinary poems.

14:07.764 --> 14:13.228
Emily's words,
her exquisite, necessary words,

14:13.812 --> 14:17.608
have been a balm to me
amid the anguish of war.

14:18.483 --> 14:22.779
Somehow,
I've been out there on the front lines,

14:22.863 --> 14:26.116
yet she's the one who's managed
to capture the experience.

14:28.076 --> 14:32.789
How is it possible that this woman
so far from the battlefield

14:32.873 --> 14:35.667
seems to speak
its deepest, darkest truths?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.214
I had to come and meet her for myself,

14:40.297 --> 14:42.591
and to see her home, of course,
and to meet her family.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.637
Tell me, when did you first realize
she was a genius?

14:49.765 --> 14:53.560
I will circle
the entirety of existence in this dress.

14:53.644 --> 14:56.396
I will journey
to the edges of consciousness itself.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.233
Okay, so you don't want a hem that drags.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.568
Consciousness is muddy.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.445
Yes. Yes!

15:03.529 --> 15:06.782
And it has to be easy to clean
so that I can wear it every day

15:06.865 --> 15:08.867
as I run through
all dimensions of experience.

15:08.951 --> 15:12.079
So then it'll have to be white.
White is simplest to wash.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.205
A white dress?

15:13.705 --> 15:17.584
Yes. Made of light,
the light that exists only in spring.

15:18.168 --> 15:22.005
Very nice. And what about construction?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.758
Latches, hooks, buttons?

15:24.842 --> 15:26.927
If it has too many buttons,
I'll need help putting it on.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.012
Well, what if it buttons
all the way up the front?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.348
Then you can put it on yourself.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.267
-A dress that buttons up the front?
-It's different.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.476
It's innovative!

15:34.560 --> 15:37.896
-Buttons all the way up the front.
-Love.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.566
Now, let's talk about shape.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.862
This is where we really make a statement.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.281
Bustles, petticoats, hoop?

15:47.364 --> 15:50.158
I don't want any of that.
I want a streamline.

15:50.242 --> 15:51.785
I'll tell you what else I don't want.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.329
-This.
-No corset?

15:54.413 --> 15:58.417
I need this dress
to let me live in every possibility.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.044
Corsets make
too many things impossible.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.882
I'll let you in on a little secret.
I don't wear no corset.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.509
Damn. Your body just looks like that?

16:07.593 --> 16:11.305
Yes and no.
I use elastic to shape the dress.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.223
-I still look stylish…
-You do.

16:13.307 --> 16:17.853
…but the elastic lets me breathe
while I'm bending and stooping in my shop.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.104
Could you work with that?

16:19.188 --> 16:23.233
I don't know. I'm thinking no shape.
Pure shapelessness.

16:23.317 --> 16:26.737
It's a lot of room to breathe in,
Emily Dickinson, but all right.

16:26.820 --> 16:30.782
No corset, no elastic,
a uniform to work in.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.952
That raises the question of utilities.

16:34.036 --> 16:37.331
-Go on.
-What are the tools your work requires?

16:37.414 --> 16:40.250
For example,
I have scissors, I have my thimble--

16:40.334 --> 16:42.669
I just need a pencil,
a few scraps of paper.

16:42.753 --> 16:43.754
All right.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.924
And you'll want to carry them with you,
I assume,

16:47.007 --> 16:48.967
for whenever inspiration strikes?

16:49.551 --> 16:50.719
That's right.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.931
Well, then you're definitely
going to need some…

16:54.014 --> 16:56.391
-Pockets.
-…pockets. Pockets.

16:58.477 --> 17:00.437
Emily, someone's here to see you.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.105
-Let's sit you down…
-A visitor.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.565
A visitor? Who?

17:04.566 --> 17:06.359
Colonel Whatsworth Bentley Tiddlywinks.

17:06.944 --> 17:09.488
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson?

17:09.570 --> 17:10.948
That's right. That's what I said.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.325
He's here? He's in our house?

17:13.407 --> 17:15.618
Downstairs with your family
waiting for ya.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.703
Oh, my God.

17:16.787 --> 17:19.330
What is he doing here? I never said
I wanted to meet in real life.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.832
Our relationship is strictly text.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.292
Are you worried
he's not gonna like the real you?

17:23.377 --> 17:27.714
I don't know what he's gonna think.
I described myself in diminutive terms.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.800
I told him I was small like the wren,

17:29.883 --> 17:32.177
and that my hair
was the color of a chestnut burr.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.138
I see. So, you catfished him?

17:35.639 --> 17:37.808
I can't go downstairs. No, we have to--

17:37.891 --> 17:40.394
We have to come up with an excuse.
Tell him--

17:40.477 --> 17:43.105
Tell him that I'm not dressed.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.274
That Betty's in here with me
taking my measurements.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.025
He'll have to come back another day.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.153
All right. I'll give that a go.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.823
But before I do,
I feel it's my duty to tell ya,

17:52.906 --> 17:55.617
he's one of the finest-looking gents
I ever laid eyes on.

17:56.368 --> 18:00.664
I don't care. I am not in love with him.
I only wanted his feedback on my poems.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.625
I'm not ready to meet him yet.
Not even close.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.711
I haven't written enough.
I'm only just beginning.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.254
It'll be years before I'm ready.

18:07.337 --> 18:10.257
So you won't be upset if I tie
my bonny red hair around his neck?

18:10.340 --> 18:12.843
Maggie, you do whatever it takes.
Just get him out of here.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.428
I can't believe he actually came.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.847
Oh, my God, Sue.
What about Sue? Is Sue gonna be mad?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.765
How do you take your tea, Colonel?

18:18.849 --> 18:21.727
And you must be hungry
after a long journey.

18:21.810 --> 18:24.021
Can I get you a piece of roast ham?

18:24.104 --> 18:25.439
No. No, thank you.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.773
I'm actually a vegetarian.

18:26.857 --> 18:28.108
How ethical.

18:28.692 --> 18:32.279
Well, then I will get you some vegetables.
I will be just a moment.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.490
Could you take your jacket off, Colonel?

18:35.574 --> 18:38.202
You're getting Civil War dust everywhere.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.580
Grandma Cookie, may I have a word?

18:47.336 --> 18:49.588
Listen to me and listen good.

18:49.671 --> 18:52.382
That man out there is very important.

18:52.466 --> 18:55.260
He is a writer,
a thinker, a revolutionary,

18:55.344 --> 18:58.555
and he came all the way here
because he admires Emily's poems.

18:58.639 --> 19:02.976
Don't you understand? He could one day
be responsible for Emily's legacy.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.896
So we are going to serve him tea,

19:05.979 --> 19:09.858
and we are going to use our best dishware.

19:09.942 --> 19:11.401
And if he asks for coffee,

19:11.485 --> 19:14.780
we are going to serve it
with sweet butter and whole eggs

19:14.863 --> 19:17.533
like The Frugal Housewife suggests.
Do you understand me?

19:18.367 --> 19:22.287
Susan Gilbert, you really are that bitch.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.747
Everything all right?

19:23.830 --> 19:27.793
Yes, we're just getting some tea
for Colonel Higginson.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.045
Where's Emily?

19:30.838 --> 19:32.297
Just a small hiccup.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.174
She's not coming down.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.928
-I'm sure she'll be down soon.
-Terribly rude.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.139
I thought we'd taught her good manners,
but a father's work is never done.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.267
Not at all. I'm sure she's busy writing.

19:43.350 --> 19:47.604
I imagine that when she's deep
in her flow, time just dissolves.

19:47.688 --> 19:50.691
Would you care for cream and sugar,
Colonel?

19:50.774 --> 19:52.317
Just say the word.

19:52.401 --> 19:54.653
No. No, I take it plain.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.614
I'm so honored
to meet the family of the artist.

19:58.991 --> 20:01.034
You must tell me all about Emily.
What is she like?

20:01.118 --> 20:02.536
Go ahead, no detail too small.

20:02.619 --> 20:07.207
After all, sometimes, people
with small lives do very big things.

20:08.876 --> 20:10.085
Well…

20:10.836 --> 20:13.839
Emily is unique.

20:13.922 --> 20:18.510
-She's a bit of an odd duck.
-She can't sew, or cook, or clean.

20:18.594 --> 20:21.597
-But boy, can she bake.
-She's, like, really into flowers.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.473
We used to catch her
talking to bumblebees.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.058
Yes, whatever happened to that bee?

20:25.142 --> 20:27.978
She's a very unique person
when you get right down to it.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.647
Yeah. She's for sure
the crazy one of the family.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.941
I'm not sure about that.

20:33.817 --> 20:35.903
-The crazy one?
-Yeah.

20:35.986 --> 20:39.531
I mean, the rest of us, pretty normal.

20:39.615 --> 20:42.451
A country at war.

20:42.534 --> 20:45.579
Divided, the men are falling.

20:45.662 --> 20:49.082
This is a statement
about isolation and security.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.211
I am a woman.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.587
The men are dying!

20:55.088 --> 20:57.549
And I am dying,

20:58.217 --> 21:01.803
knitted into the details of my life,

21:02.471 --> 21:04.723
as are we all.

21:06.558 --> 21:07.851
Are you my father?

21:07.935 --> 21:09.978
I'm your-- I'm her father.

21:10.062 --> 21:13.023
To be trapped a Dickinson.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.900
That's not Emily, by the way.

21:14.983 --> 21:15.984
No, this i--

21:16.568 --> 21:18.445
I think…

21:20.822 --> 21:22.991
Yeah. I think this ought to work.

21:23.784 --> 21:24.785
That's it.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.830
A new kind of dress…

21:29.957 --> 21:31.583
for a new kind of poetry.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.463
Are you sure you don't want me
to make it for you?

21:36.547 --> 21:39.550
-It would only take a few weeks.
-No. I want to do the work myself.

21:42.052 --> 21:44.638
Thank you
for helping me dream today, Betty.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.311
What do I tell your family?

21:52.646 --> 21:54.064
Tell them I can't come down.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.151
Tell them…

21:59.319 --> 22:00.320
I'm writing.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.042
You know what?

22:16.211 --> 22:19.923
Even if I can't change the world…

22:22.050 --> 22:23.594
I'm still gonna write.

22:26.180 --> 22:28.265
Even if no one ever cares.

22:30.726 --> 22:33.604
Even if it makes absolutely no difference

22:35.647 --> 22:40.152
that there was a person
named Emily Dickinson who sat…

22:42.196 --> 22:43.488
in this little room…

22:47.159 --> 22:48.702
day after day…

22:50.996 --> 22:53.665
and wrote things down
just because she felt them.

22:58.504 --> 22:59.755
The tea is lovely.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.715
Hi. I'm Vinnie.

23:02.216 --> 23:03.884
Thomas Wentworth Higginson.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.386
But you can call me Wentworth.

23:07.179 --> 23:08.430
Absolutely.

23:08.514 --> 23:09.806
Hands off. He's mine.

23:10.474 --> 23:13.018
-Well, now that Lavinia's here…
-Horny.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.187
…maybe we should do our big reveal?

23:15.812 --> 23:19.066
Before you got here, we were
about to announce the name of our baby.

23:19.149 --> 23:20.567
You've finally picked a name.

23:20.651 --> 23:22.945
They took long enough.
This child is four months old.

23:23.028 --> 23:24.821
Get on with it. Get on with it!

23:24.905 --> 23:28.283
-Cool! Who's gonna say it?
-Actually, the baby's going to say it.

23:28.367 --> 23:30.035
-Right, Sue?
-Yes.

23:31.495 --> 23:33.580
He has written a letter.

23:33.664 --> 23:36.834
Wow, he's a letter writer.
He takes after his aunt.

23:36.917 --> 23:39.628
It is-- It's addressed to you,
Mr. Dickinson.

23:40.212 --> 23:42.339
-Shall I read it?
-Please do.

23:42.965 --> 23:44.508
Make sure you do the voice.

23:45.092 --> 23:46.218
There's a voice?

23:49.096 --> 23:51.431
"Dear Grandfather…

23:53.058 --> 23:57.229
I've been in this great world
ever so many days

23:57.312 --> 23:59.773
and haven't got any name yet."

23:59.857 --> 24:01.567
Yes. Emily's the crazy one.

24:01.650 --> 24:05.028
"My mother says you have a very nice name,

24:05.112 --> 24:09.241
and I might ask you
if I can't have one just like it.

24:09.825 --> 24:13.370
If you are willing
that such a little bit of a man

24:14.079 --> 24:19.042
could have such a big name as yours,
please tell me."

24:21.670 --> 24:24.381
We're naming the baby Edward after you.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.925
That is, with your permission.

24:27.009 --> 24:30.387
Well, that is the greatest honor
of my long life.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.890
Edward. Baby Edward.

24:32.973 --> 24:35.767
-We're going to call him Ned.
-Baby Ned.

24:35.851 --> 24:37.311
This is beautiful.

24:40.439 --> 24:43.734
-The baby has a name.
-Betty, I didn't know you were still here.

24:43.817 --> 24:45.861
Just helping Emily with a new dress.

24:45.944 --> 24:47.112
I'll be on my way now.

24:47.696 --> 24:48.906
Congratulations to you.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.157
Thank you.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.533
And get ready,

24:51.617 --> 24:54.453
I'm going to be ordering
lots of Sunday suits for my grandson

24:54.536 --> 24:56.496
now that he has his Christian name.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.541
I can't wait to bring little Ned to church

24:59.625 --> 25:01.710
and make
all the other grandmothers jealous.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.795
Which is just what religion is all about.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.548
Bye.

25:06.632 --> 25:08.800
That's Betty.
She does all of our tailoring.

25:08.884 --> 25:12.221
Yeah. And she's
the best seamstress in Amherst.

25:12.930 --> 25:14.223
Excuse me for just a moment.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.310
Love the uniform.

25:20.646 --> 25:22.147
I think he likes us.

25:22.231 --> 25:24.149
Is Emily ever coming down?

25:24.233 --> 25:25.526
Pardon me, Betty.

25:26.235 --> 25:27.236
You're Betty, right?

25:27.819 --> 25:30.531
Excuse me? Who wants to know?

25:31.448 --> 25:32.741
Forgive me, madam.

25:34.117 --> 25:36.161
My name is
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson.

25:36.745 --> 25:38.747
I've had the honor of serving with

25:38.830 --> 25:40.916
the first-ever regiment
of Black Union soldiers,

25:41.500 --> 25:43.460
the First South Carolina Volunteers.

25:43.544 --> 25:44.753
Perhaps you know of it.

25:45.712 --> 25:46.880
You fought with Henry.

25:46.964 --> 25:48.340
No.

25:48.423 --> 25:51.510
No, he fought on his own, he and his men.

25:52.094 --> 25:56.265
They armed themselves
and ran out to meet the enemy.

25:56.348 --> 25:57.808
It was a brave thing to do.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.647
There was a battle--
A skirmish, really, but a fierce one.

26:03.730 --> 26:07.234
The Confederates
were on the march to Beaufort,

26:07.317 --> 26:10.779
and the South Carolina Volunteers
went out and intercepted them-- ambushed.

26:11.989 --> 26:15.284
Henry was among them.

26:15.868 --> 26:17.494
Is he…

26:18.078 --> 26:19.872
Henry survived the battle. He's--

26:21.039 --> 26:22.124
He's very much alive.

26:25.586 --> 26:28.922
And sweetest -- in the Gale -- is heard --

26:29.006 --> 26:30.716
And sore must be the storm --

26:30.799 --> 26:32.926
That could abash the little Bird

26:33.010 --> 26:34.636
That kept so many warm --

26:34.720 --> 26:36.013
I didn't dare to hope.

26:38.682 --> 26:39.892
And…

26:42.603 --> 26:43.812
I brought something for you.

26:55.032 --> 26:56.283
Henry's letters.

26:57.743 --> 26:59.161
Delivered at last.

26:59.244 --> 27:03.624
I always say, great writing finds a way
to reach its audience.

27:09.922 --> 27:11.215
Madam.

27:28.148 --> 27:30.442
I'm terribly sorry
she hasn't come down yet, Colonel.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.152
I don't mind.

27:34.321 --> 27:35.864
I'll wait as long as it takes.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.494
What's an hour or two
for a poet like Emily?

27:42.329 --> 27:44.998
People might have to wait
centuries to really understand her.

27:46.542 --> 27:50.796
You know, it used to be said
in the old Irish wars

27:50.879 --> 27:52.548
that the clans had an agreement.

27:53.924 --> 27:56.468
That no matter how bloody the war became,

27:57.511 --> 27:59.471
no matter how many were slaughtered,

28:01.974 --> 28:04.268
that they should always spare the poets.

28:05.769 --> 28:07.729
"Don't kill the poets," they'd say,

28:08.480 --> 28:11.859
because the poets had to be left
to tell the story.

28:16.738 --> 28:21.034
This was a Poet -- It is That --

28:23.120 --> 28:25.247
Distills amazing sense

28:26.206 --> 28:27.958
From ordinary Meanings --

28:30.502 --> 28:32.880
And attar so immense

28:40.345 --> 28:42.806
I have a Bird in spring

28:50.689 --> 28:53.275
The Sun -- just touched the Morning --

29:00.407 --> 29:02.910
The last of Summer is Delight --

29:10.417 --> 29:13.462
I tie my Hat -- I crease my Shawl --

29:22.763 --> 29:24.932
Autumn -- overlooked my Knitting --

29:35.859 --> 29:38.153
There is no Frigate like a Book

29:44.910 --> 29:46.870
In Winter in my Room

30:19.361 --> 30:20.696
I started Early --

30:24.575 --> 30:25.617
Took my Dog --

30:28.787 --> 30:30.247
And visited the Sea --

31:19.963 --> 31:24.384
Emily. Emily, come on! Emily…

31:27.888 --> 31:31.767
The Mermaids in the Basement
Came out to look at me --

31:33.018 --> 31:34.394
Come, Emily. Come.

32:21.191 --> 32:22.526
Wait for me.

32:24.069 --> 32:25.529
I'm coming.
