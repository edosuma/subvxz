00:54.640 --> 00:57.440
The screams of the victim deaden his pain.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.280
The act of killing
makes him feel intensely alive.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.960
What he feels next is not guilt...

01:04.160 --> 01:05.800
...but disappointment.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.200
It was not as wonderful as he'd hoped.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.880
Maybe next time, it will be perfect.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.640
And as his determination builds
to take another life...

01:14.760 --> 01:17.120
...he plans, in obsessive detail...

01:17.320 --> 01:19.040
...what props he'll bring...

01:19.120 --> 01:21.080
...what knots he'll tie.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.640
Let me ask you something.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.120
What turns you on?

01:26.400 --> 01:29.280
What really does it for you?
Is it a great body?

01:29.360 --> 01:32.160
Is it a nice smile? Is it beautiful legs?

01:32.640 --> 01:37.160
What turns on a serial killer is the suffering
and death of a human being.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.400
Now, I'd like to ask you guys a favor.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.520
If you could all stand up,
all the men in the room.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.240
Please indulge me.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.160
Come on, it's only fair,
after all the time you've ogled us.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.840
Now, would everybody under 20
and over 35 have a seat.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.240
If you are of Asian or African-American
descent, you may sit down.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.880
Kenny, turn that light on, please...

02:03.280 --> 02:06.000
...so we can get a good look at these guys.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.280
Ladies, what do you see?

02:09.039 --> 02:11.240
Some pretty cute guys, don't you think?

02:11.320 --> 02:14.760
If one of these fellas asked you out
for a drink, you'd go.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.000
Let me tell you something.

02:17.160 --> 02:20.280
Nine out of ten serial killers
are white males...

02:21.040 --> 02:22.600
...aged 20 to 35...

02:22.720 --> 02:24.440
...just like these.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.080
Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono...

02:28.480 --> 02:30.760
...Berkowitz, Dahmer, Ted Bundy.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.880
They were quiet, unassuming...

02:33.000 --> 02:34.400
...even nice.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.000
They had jobs.
They made decent neighbors.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.160
Their victims trusted them.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.560
The FBl estimates...

02:40.680 --> 02:43.800
...there could be as many
as 35 serial killers...

02:43.960 --> 02:46.680
...cruising for victims even as I speak.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.360
Guys, sit down. You're scaring me.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.280
Serial killers...

02:52.400 --> 02:54.520
...are not a 20th-century invention...

02:54.640 --> 02:57.240
...but we are spawning them
in greater numbers.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.920
The state of Florida
spent almost $8 million...

03:01.040 --> 03:02.680
...to electrocute Ted--

03:04.080 --> 03:05.480
You're dead.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.480
Sorry.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.680
The state of Florida spent $8 million
to electrocute Ted Bundy.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.800
Wouldn't that money have been
better spent keeping him in jail...

03:23.000 --> 03:25.440
...subject to intense scientific scrutiny?

03:25.720 --> 03:30.000
Isn't our best hope to try to identify
the Ted Bundys of the future...

03:30.720 --> 03:32.440
...before they kill?

03:33.720 --> 03:34.840
Thank you.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.280
Don't park next to vans.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.520
Thanks for coming.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.400
I'm hitting the ladies' room.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.320
Since she's using the ladies' room,
I'll use the men's room.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.880
-Thanks for your help, Tom.
-Anytime.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.320
Hello?

04:06.960 --> 04:08.160
Sorry, ma'am.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.960
Doc, it's all yours.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.360
Dr. Hudson?

05:18.560 --> 05:19.680
Hello?

05:30.160 --> 05:31.960
Come out with your hands up.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.640
I'm not going to ask you--

05:44.400 --> 05:46.680
What are you doing with my gun?

05:47.560 --> 05:49.200
How'd you get my gun?

05:49.360 --> 05:53.480
What are you doing in the ladies' room?
Are you spying on little girls?

05:56.240 --> 05:58.280
I'll tell you something right now.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.080
Don't she look pretty up there, Officer?

06:01.200 --> 06:03.320
You know what I want to know?

06:03.480 --> 06:05.960
Help me out on this,
since you're the expert.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.120
How would a fartknocker like me...

06:08.200 --> 06:10.560
...take out a dumb guy like this?

06:10.960 --> 06:12.520
Would you stick him...

06:12.880 --> 06:13.920
...or would you shoot him?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.880
Stick him or shoot him?

06:17.320 --> 06:20.680
I can't decide, but I think I'll just go ahead
and do both.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.480
You bloodied up my knife, you dog.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.400
I hate cops.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.800
Hey, Dr. Hudson.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.000
What do you say me
and you have a little fun?

07:12.520 --> 07:13.720
John Adams....

07:14.800 --> 07:15.960
Adams...

07:16.120 --> 07:17.600
...Jefferson...

07:19.040 --> 07:21.160
...James Monroe, James Madison...

07:22.720 --> 07:24.440
...John Quincy Adams.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.080
Andy?

07:27.600 --> 07:28.720
Andy?

07:34.840 --> 07:36.480
John Quincy Adams.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.160
Andrew Jackson.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.400
Martin Van Buren.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.680
Wait a minute. This is so stupid.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.240
Calvin Coolidge.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.400
I got you beat.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.080
Bye, Kate.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.680
Police! Freeze!

10:46.400 --> 10:48.960
The good news is, you're still alive.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.040
You see a downside to that?

10:52.160 --> 10:54.120
This is pretty remedial stuff.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.360
Let's review the scenario.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.880
Didn't anyone at the Academy
teach you to shoot conservatively?

11:01.200 --> 11:02.320
You shredded him.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.880
I'm an intuitive cop.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.800
With poor impulse control.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.800
Let's assume you didn't mow down
a 75-year-old man...

11:08.880 --> 11:11.760
...who couldn't hear your warning
because he's deaf.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.800
Let's say you greased the guy
while he was trying to surrender.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.960
Now, you're on leave pending an inquiry.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.560
Friends wonder if you're a psychopath.
On top of that...

11:22.680 --> 11:27.120
...the guy's junkie-wife's lawyer slams
a wrongful-death action up your tail.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.720
All right, smart-ass, let's see how you do.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.640
The shoulder of his gun hand's exposed.

11:37.720 --> 11:41.400
You hit the brachial nerve,
he drops the gun. You read him his rights.

11:41.520 --> 11:45.480
Plus, you haven't taken a human life
so your karma's still okay.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.320
You hungry? I'm starving.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.480
-Aren't you going to answer that?
-No, it's probably not important.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.920
She thinks it is.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.240
How about Moroccan? You like couscous?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.600
Don't you want to know which one it is?

11:58.960 --> 11:59.920
Hello?

12:00.240 --> 12:03.920
You must have mental telepathy.
I was just about to call you.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.600
The usual.
Long days making sure justice prevails.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.160
10390 Mariposa.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.560
Scaffolding on the north and west sides
of the building.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.680
Great. The Mouth is here.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.560
You can end her career.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.880
Pop her in the brachial nerve,
she'll drop the microphone.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.600
It's a thought.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.520
-How are you?
-Fine, thanks.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.960
Can you confirm that this latest murder
fits the same pattern as the other two?

13:52.080 --> 13:54.280
We just got here. I'm not prepared to--

13:54.360 --> 13:57.880
Is there a serial killer stalking
the streets of San Francisco?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.200
Excuse me. I'm a member of the press.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.640
Hey, MJ, all done.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.840
Hey, Jim. Can you grab some overalls
from the crowd, some nice, clear faces?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.880
I'll make them say "cheese."

14:08.320 --> 14:09.880
The landlady found her.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.880
The front door was open.
She tried the bell.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.080
The tenant didn't answer,
so she went inside and found the body.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.800
She used the telephone to dial 911,
otherwise she touched nothing.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.200
-You're thinking robbery?
-It doesn't look like it.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.000
It's all yours, kids.
I'll take care of the Mouth.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.440
Good morning, sir.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.560
-With this scaffolding, we should call--
-I'll call the contractor.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.000
Take this.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.600
Good morning.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.560
Were you first on the scene?

14:38.480 --> 14:39.960
Is that the landlady?

14:40.920 --> 14:42.080
Thanks.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.760
-"Johnson." What's the first part?
-Mike.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.600
Did you touch anything, Mike?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.840
I don't want to get excited about
latents and find out they're yours.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.960
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't?

14:54.280 --> 14:58.040
She usually goes jogging in the morning,
to the Delores Park.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.080
This one.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.280
Pretty wild.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.520
How're you doing?

16:08.160 --> 16:09.800
Got an estimate for me?

16:10.200 --> 16:11.840
About eight hours.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.480
I'm seeing ligature marks, petechiae.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.040
Strangled, huh?

16:17.320 --> 16:19.040
Same as the others.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.720
You'll bag all the stuff
on the bedside table?

16:21.840 --> 16:25.200
Thanks, Bill. Excellent.
That's the only one I need.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.000
Were you the first one here?

16:36.080 --> 16:37.400
Did you touch anything?

16:37.520 --> 16:38.800
No, ma'am.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.960
What's wrong?

16:42.160 --> 16:43.320
Nothing.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.720
If you're holding out on me,
I'll get it out of you. You know I will.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.880
There was a stocking around her neck
when I found her.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.120
I don't know what happened to it.

16:56.440 --> 16:59.160
Who else was in there
before the CSI came?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.280
Lieutenant Quinn.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.079
That's all right, then.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.480
Thanks, Mike.

17:06.560 --> 17:10.520
Celebrating 25 years of the spirit
of the 60s in San Francisco...

17:11.560 --> 17:15.000
...the Festival of Love got underway today
in Golden Gate Park.

17:15.119 --> 17:17.760
Why did you remove evidence from the--

17:18.720 --> 17:20.040
I want to hear this.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.800
In Potrero Hill...

17:22.079 --> 17:26.119
...homicide detectives discovered
yet another grisly murder today.

17:26.400 --> 17:30.160
Police would not comment, but informed
sources inside the Department...

17:30.240 --> 17:31.880
...tell us this latest death...

17:32.000 --> 17:36.760
...could be the work of the same killer
responsible for the deaths of two women.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.240
Susan Schiffer, Potrero Hill.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.920
You messed with the scene.

17:41.040 --> 17:44.720
Someone around here can't keep
his yap shut, and I'll find out who.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.360
What did you do with the stocking?

17:46.480 --> 17:47.800
I tagged it.

17:47.880 --> 17:51.160
I don't want some blabbermouth
leaking the MO to her...

17:51.280 --> 17:54.800
...so she can tell everyone,
leaving us nothing to play.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.680
Am I in charge of this or not?

17:59.600 --> 18:00.920
Why are you so prickly?

18:01.000 --> 18:04.600
I ought to be the one deciding
what evidence to sequester.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.640
All right, lnspector.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.560
Which evidence on this case
would you like to sequester?

18:10.680 --> 18:14.040
-The stocking around the neck.
-The stocking around the neck.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.440
You're one pushy broad, MJ.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.840
I'll take that as a compliment, sir.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.080
I didn't say serial killer,
you didn't say serial killer.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.760
For Christ's sake.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.920
Again.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.800
George Washington.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.520
John Adams.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.040
Thomas Jefferson.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.800
James Madison.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.760
James Monroe.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.040
Oh, come on.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.240
John Quincy Adams.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.920
Martin Van Buren.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.160
ldiots!

19:59.040 --> 20:01.680
You followed the girl home. Then what?

20:02.720 --> 20:03.920
I killed her.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.440
Where did you do that?

20:08.560 --> 20:10.120
It was in the bathtub.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.200
Why did you do that?

20:16.040 --> 20:17.520
She was dirty.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.240
She was a very dirty girl. Very dirty.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.600
Do you remember...

20:24.800 --> 20:27.240
...how many times you stabbed her?

20:29.400 --> 20:30.800
Eighty-seven.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.480
Harvey....

20:37.280 --> 20:39.080
Get the fuck out of here.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.840
I got work to do.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.200
Come on, let's go. What?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.440
lnnocent blood is on these hands.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.840
I understand. That's a terrible thing.
But let me tell you...

20:49.960 --> 20:53.720
...if you come back,
I'll make you stand in the corner again.

20:54.320 --> 20:58.520
-But innocent blood is on these hands.
-I understand. It's terrible.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.680
You don't care about the truth.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.200
We pay for city government, just like this,
and you never care about the truth.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.360
I killed her!

21:08.480 --> 21:10.680
-I know.
-I killed her in the bathtub.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.280
Good-bye, Harvey.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.520
Was it something I did in another life?

21:17.680 --> 21:19.960
Probably something you did in this one.

21:21.760 --> 21:24.800
Stuff came in from Mercer.
Medical, dental receipts....

21:25.040 --> 21:27.160
Nothing in common with the others.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.320
What's that around your neck?

21:30.800 --> 21:34.160
I'd get one like yours,
but I don't live near K Mart.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.960
How about friends, acquaintances?

21:37.840 --> 21:40.960
The only thing these girls had in common
is they all owned vibrators.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.600
The tool of survival.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.360
How can he come to work wearing that?

21:45.520 --> 21:46.800
Lay off him.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.720
A cop should look like a cop.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.840
What's the world coming to?

21:51.840 --> 21:54.560
Let me let you talk to the lead inspector
on the case.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.880
Hold on.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.280
MJ, we got Deep Throat again.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.240
How many calls is that?

22:01.360 --> 22:04.160
That makes three today. Fourteen, total.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.680
Phone company set up on our Centrex?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.120
Yes, this morning.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.560
-Have Gigi put a tracer on her ass.
-I'll see if it'll work.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.240
lnspector Monahan speaking. Homicide.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.200
Ask her about the moon bike.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.240
I'm interested in your ideas.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.080
The moon bike....

22:25.560 --> 22:26.520
What is that?

22:26.640 --> 22:27.680
Moon bike?

22:28.040 --> 22:31.000
I said a "lunar cycle."
I think he might be on a lunar cycle.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.160
Because the first two murders
were 28 days apart.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.640
Still want to crackjokes?

22:35.760 --> 22:39.800
No, this is no joke. Neither is tying up
police lines with crank calls.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.640
Are you calling me a crank?

22:41.840 --> 22:44.880
Do you have any evidence to report?
Did you know the victims?

22:44.960 --> 22:46.440
This is Number 3.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.320
That is an opinion, not evidence.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.600
May I ask who I'm speaking with?

22:59.840 --> 23:01.240
Who's Helen Hudson?

23:01.440 --> 23:05.720
What did you think of his claim,
that he tied these women to a tree...

23:05.840 --> 23:08.880
...and burned them alive
because Joan of Arc told him to?

23:08.960 --> 23:10.160
He was lying.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.720
How do you know?

23:11.840 --> 23:15.960
People suffering from aural hallucinations
hear voices in both ears.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.200
In stereo.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.080
Daryll Lee told me...

23:19.760 --> 23:21.560
...Joan of Arc always appeared
on his left side...

23:21.680 --> 23:24.040
...and spoke softly in his left ear.

23:24.240 --> 23:27.440
Those are the lab results,
hot off the press. No sperm.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.120
We've got a serial.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.960
You didn't say that.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.240
You interviewed Cullum three times.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.200
Who's that?
The woman that got the cop killed?

23:37.280 --> 23:38.600
She might be useful.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.160
That woman is a wrong number.
Work the clues, for Christ's sake.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.800
What clues? We don't have any clues.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.640
Nobody here has ever worked
a serial case before.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.520
I have.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.920
The Zodiac, right?

23:52.080 --> 23:55.760
Did anyone ever catch the Zodiac,
or did he die of old age?

23:57.120 --> 23:59.760
Commissioner's on 2,
about the Chinatown thing.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.560
Work the clues.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.760
But what else?

24:07.800 --> 24:10.240
Mr. Cullum satisfies the rules for sanity...

24:10.320 --> 24:12.440
...in being fully aware
at the time of the murders...

24:12.520 --> 24:14.880
...that his actions were wrong
and unlawful.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.400
Thank you, Dr. Hudson.
No more questions.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.720
San Francisco Homicide.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.440
I'm lnspector Goetz.
This is lnspector Monahan.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.360
Is Helen Hudson here?

24:34.480 --> 24:36.440
I'm her assistant. Can I help?

24:36.560 --> 24:38.680
Could we have a few minutes?

24:39.920 --> 24:40.880
Come in.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.160
This way, please.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.640
Dr. Hudson, these are lnspectors Goetz
and Monahan.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.320
He's escaped again, right?

24:55.440 --> 24:56.400
I'm sorry?

24:56.520 --> 24:57.240
Well?

24:57.360 --> 24:59.160
Is he out or isn't he?

24:59.440 --> 25:01.320
I'm not following, ma'am.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.680
Let's talk about your phone calls.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.240
Phone calls?

25:05.520 --> 25:07.640
I didn't make any phone calls.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.760
Isn't this nice?

25:11.040 --> 25:14.160
Would everyone like to sit down?
Shall I make coffee?

25:14.680 --> 25:15.880
Get me my stuff.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.160
Joyfully.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.920
I talked to you this morning, Dr. Hudson.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.320
Do you remember?

25:23.440 --> 25:25.240
Of course I remember.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.720
There's nothing wrong with my memory.
You called me a crank.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.480
I suppose I am.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.160
I got a couple crank calls myself.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.440
That's why I thought
Daryll Lee Cullum was out of prison.

25:37.920 --> 25:41.360
If Daryll Lee had gotten out,
you'd be the first to know.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.200
Good.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.440
I'm relieved.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.840
I hate to sound like a broken record,
but you called us.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.280
I did. I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.360
Why?

25:53.480 --> 25:57.680
There's a serial killer out there who's
strangled three women. He'll do it again.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.760
If there's evidence connecting these
murders, nothing's been made public.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.400
How do you connect them?

26:03.480 --> 26:04.600
I don't know.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.160
Twenty years of clinical experience
with serial killers.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.800
Would you work with us on this?

26:13.840 --> 26:15.160
You're kidding?

26:18.840 --> 26:21.800
I thought you knew
that I don't do this anymore.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.120
I'm retired.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.640
Is that why you called us 14 times?
'Cause you're retired?

26:26.800 --> 26:29.160
Help me out. I really admire your work.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.840
Does she do this...

26:31.440 --> 26:33.560
...wide-eyed-little-girl routine often?

26:33.680 --> 26:34.640
Yeah.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.960
Does it work?

26:37.200 --> 26:38.920
-Usually.
-Sometimes.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.640
You can spare me the bullshit.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.200
You don't admire me or like me.
None of your people do.

26:45.360 --> 26:49.240
But I don't give a fuck!
That's the upside of a nervous breakdown.

26:50.320 --> 26:52.760
If you don't mind, I have a very busy day.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.800
It's a hell of an apartment you got here.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.280
I guess...

26:58.400 --> 27:01.280
...the books you wrote
about these scumbags paid well.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.560
We can't afford to pay you...

27:04.160 --> 27:05.560
...your usual fee...

27:05.680 --> 27:08.480
...but if you'd be so kind as to look....

27:10.000 --> 27:11.320
I don't want these here.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.320
-Would you be comfortable downtown?
-I don't want to see them here.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.280
I'll drive you, if you prefer.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.080
It's all right. It's okay.
Just breathe. I'm here.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.640
-Should we call the paramedics?
-No.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.960
It's just a good, old-fashioned panic attack.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.960
She hyperventilates till she faints, then her
breathing gets normal and she's fine.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.000
-What did we do?
-She's agoraphobic.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.200
She's afraid of spiders, too?

27:42.720 --> 27:44.440
She hasn't left home in over a year.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.800
She's okay?

27:45.920 --> 27:48.560
She's fine. ln half an hour,
she'll be singing.

27:48.800 --> 27:49.960
Tell her...

27:50.520 --> 27:52.560
...we're sorry we bothered her.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.240
Did you want her to look at those?

27:55.320 --> 27:56.880
If you do, leave them.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.160
I'll make sure they're safe.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.920
Tell her to call me...

28:01.080 --> 28:02.720
...if she feels like it.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.520
That one is a strange ranger.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.640
Quinn said she was a crackpot.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.720
He forgot to mention pill-popping
juicehead...

28:19.760 --> 28:22.480
...hyperventilating, agoraphobic asshole.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.640
I thought she was sweet.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.560
Honest to God!

28:50.960 --> 28:52.240
Are they gone?

28:52.960 --> 28:53.920
All gone.

28:55.920 --> 28:58.480
I must've looked like such an asshole.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.440
You look good with a bag on your head.

29:02.520 --> 29:03.720
Oh, God.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.240
I want to die.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.480
I wouldn't.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.000
He'll be back.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.400
Who'll be back?

29:09.920 --> 29:11.320
Don't be coy.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.000
You thought he was cute, too.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.040
No, I didn't. I did not.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.920
You like those cute, brutal types
with the eyebrows and the handcuffs.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.080
Admit it.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.400
Oh, God.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.240
What? What'd I say?

29:28.920 --> 29:30.040
Nothing.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.120
I miss men.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.280
What am l?

29:34.400 --> 29:35.880
You know what I mean.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.200
I miss sex.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.800
He was pretty cute.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.720
Yes, he was very cute.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.000
No young cops for you.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.160
Up you come. Sit over here.
Look at these pictures.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.560
Why are these here?

29:57.680 --> 29:59.320
I'll get you some coffee.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.280
I can't.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.400
Why don't you just die, then?

30:03.760 --> 30:08.040
They'll find you years from now amongst
unopened mail and unread newspapers.

30:09.200 --> 30:13.080
Yeah, the old hermit lady.
She lived on cat food and Camembert.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.720
She used to be a really good shrink.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.560
Make up your mind. Here's your coffee.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.200
Live or die.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.080
You scared me.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.840
Burning the midnight oil?

35:01.360 --> 35:03.400
This stuff never gets any easier.

35:03.480 --> 35:06.120
That's why they pay us the small bucks.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.720
Do you....

35:18.840 --> 35:20.560
What would you think if...

35:20.760 --> 35:23.560
...when you're finished here
we go to Joe's and we...

35:23.640 --> 35:25.520
...have a steak and....

35:28.640 --> 35:30.120
I don't think so.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.840
Thanks anyway.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.600
You got other plans?
Not that it's any of my business....

35:38.640 --> 35:40.120
You got that right.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.320
Bean curd, smoked-eel sushi.

35:44.240 --> 35:47.280
We got prawn tempura, seaweed salad.
You want to join us?

35:47.360 --> 35:49.720
You kiss your mother after eating that?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.880
No. I can kiss you, if you like.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.280
Go fuck yourself.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.240
Who put the bug up his ass?

36:02.320 --> 36:03.880
Where's my cheeseburger?

36:04.200 --> 36:06.000
I made an executive decision.

36:06.640 --> 36:07.880
Japanese.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.760
It's better for your heart.

36:13.680 --> 36:16.320
You didn't even get French fries.
You're pissing me off.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.640
Here, here.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.880
Any word from...

36:20.240 --> 36:22.360
...Helen "Paper Bag" Hudson?

36:22.880 --> 36:24.840
Not yet, but there will be.

36:25.040 --> 36:25.600
No way.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.000
Five bucks she's going to call tonight.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.200
Deal.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.480
Wait a minute.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.320
What's this Quarter Pounder
with cheese doing here?

36:52.160 --> 36:54.120
lnspector Monahan, please.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.880
These three are the work of the same man.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.160
This one is different.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.080
Are you testing me?

37:02.280 --> 37:04.720
Not exactly. We had reason to believe....

37:04.880 --> 37:06.680
I have to take tests now?

37:09.680 --> 37:10.800
Ongoing case?

37:10.880 --> 37:12.080
Six months.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.200
The scene is disorganized.

37:15.280 --> 37:18.560
The killer lives nearby.
He would've been too disoriented to drive.

37:18.640 --> 37:23.080
You have two possibilities: One is
a mental patient, the other is a boyfriend.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.840
Someone who was denied sex
on this occasion...

37:25.920 --> 37:27.480
...who knew and cared about her.

37:27.560 --> 37:28.880
He beat the shit out of her.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.520
But he felt remorse.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.400
He covered her up afterward,
because he felt conflicted.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.080
Not like this man.

37:37.840 --> 37:41.120
These are the work of someone
who is not conflicted at all.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.600
He's doing exactly what he wants to do.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.920
Highly organized.

37:45.040 --> 37:48.080
I'll bet there were no prints,
no stains, no blood.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.200
Right.

37:49.280 --> 37:52.320
No sign of forced entry.
He probably conned his way in.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.840
They may or may not be about sex...

37:55.120 --> 37:56.680
...but they're about power.

37:56.760 --> 37:59.320
See the multiple thumbprints
along the throat?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.560
Was the hyoid bone broken?

38:01.680 --> 38:03.080
Yes, it was.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.680
He strangles them face to face,
so they can see his power...

38:06.800 --> 38:09.240
...and he can watch their terror.
That gets him off.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.400
Then he revives them and does it again.

38:11.520 --> 38:16.200
Look for an intelligent white male,
20 to 30 years old, socially functional...

38:16.640 --> 38:19.440
...with a major interest in golden oldies.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.480
Did I pass?

38:24.800 --> 38:27.440
You passed.
What do you mean by golden oldies?

38:28.240 --> 38:31.440
Where's the stocking
that was tied around this one's neck?

38:31.920 --> 38:33.120
How'd you know that?

38:33.240 --> 38:35.960
I mean, I assume it was a stocking
and not pantyhose...

38:36.080 --> 38:37.960
...tied in a big loopy bow...

38:38.040 --> 38:39.440
...like this one.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.560
Right.

38:41.680 --> 38:44.640
For goodness sakes,
it's the Boston Strangler.

38:44.880 --> 38:49.000
He's imitating Albert DeSalvo's
crime scene down to the kinky details.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.080
This guy's copycatting a serial killer
who's been dead for....

38:52.200 --> 38:53.480
Twenty years.

38:53.560 --> 38:56.120
Why DeSalvo? Why not somebody
in the news recently?

38:56.200 --> 38:57.760
Gacy or Ramirez?

38:58.440 --> 38:59.640
I don't know.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.960
These guys are like viruses.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.840
There's always some new mutation.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.720
The commissioner is up my ass,
saying we could use help here.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.880
We could use help.
We need their VlCAP, we need their...

39:48.280 --> 39:50.080
...database thingies.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.800
The FBI will bury you with fucking help.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.240
During Patty Hearst...

39:54.320 --> 39:58.080
...some kid with a crew cut
took over my office for a month.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.080
So, you're saying...?

40:00.880 --> 40:02.680
I'm saying, if you need help...

40:02.760 --> 40:05.720
...Nikko is almost through
with the Chinatown thing.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.240
That really won't be necessary, sir.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.440
Join us. We need you.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.600
Anyone with a similar profile
to the Strangler.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.680
Or with a German wife. Can you do that?

40:14.800 --> 40:17.080
Anyone who wears green pants....

40:17.680 --> 40:19.000
The files in from Boston, yet?

40:19.120 --> 40:21.080
Should be here tomorrow.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.080
What are you up to?

40:23.200 --> 40:24.320
Going to Chinatown.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.520
Sit in on this for a minute.

40:29.400 --> 40:30.960
What do you got?

40:46.760 --> 40:47.800
Winning?

40:48.400 --> 40:49.880
I'm pulverizing him.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.400
All right, I'm off.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.680
-See you.
-Have a good time.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.760
I won't wait up.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.520
Got you.

42:21.720 --> 42:22.840
She's next.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.000
How do you know?

42:24.080 --> 42:26.120
'Cause I watched her face change to that.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.000
Did you try to play it back?

42:28.400 --> 42:29.880
How did he send this to you?

42:29.960 --> 42:31.760
He hacked into her lnternet address.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.400
Can we trace it?

42:33.760 --> 42:35.720
-Only if he's online right now.
-He ain't.

42:35.840 --> 42:37.320
Can we rewind or...?

42:38.480 --> 42:40.840
Yeah, we should be able to play it back.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.440
-How long is the program?
-Thirty seconds.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.720
-Can we get a copy of that face?
-No, it's too big a file.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.720
Back up to tape.

42:49.680 --> 42:53.640
She's got a tape backup.
We can make a copy and take it with us.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.760
How do you know all this?

42:55.960 --> 42:58.560
Misspent youth in video arcades, I guess.

42:59.440 --> 43:00.920
A lot of quarters.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.760
Why would he send this to you?

43:04.840 --> 43:05.880
Why do you think?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.320
No one mentioned your involvement.

43:07.400 --> 43:10.280
There is no involvement. I'm not involved!

43:10.440 --> 43:13.080
This is a game they play.
They hang around watching the cops...

43:13.200 --> 43:14.520
...feeling superior to them.

43:14.640 --> 43:16.840
lnstead of catching him, you led him to me.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.240
He didn't write to me,
he wrote to you. Why?

43:19.320 --> 43:21.200
Because I'm their damn pinup girl.

43:21.320 --> 43:24.680
They all know me. They have libraries.
They collect clippings.

43:24.760 --> 43:26.960
I'm the muse of serial killers.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.560
Try the C drive.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.920
Any other suggestions?

43:48.480 --> 43:50.600
It's gone. The file is not here.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.920
It's not on C drive, and it's not in List.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.800
You think he put a virus in there?

43:57.200 --> 43:58.920
-Yeah.
-What exactly is...?

43:59.040 --> 44:02.000
He wrote a virus into the program.
If you try to copy it, it's erased.

44:02.120 --> 44:03.160
He booby-trapped it!

44:03.280 --> 44:04.920
I must hand it to the guy.

44:05.120 --> 44:08.720
-He's a smart motherfucker.
-Do you remember what she looked like?

44:09.640 --> 44:10.680
Yes.

44:10.920 --> 44:12.640
She looked like a girl.

44:12.760 --> 44:14.960
She looked like a million other girls.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.840
I barely saw her.

44:24.080 --> 44:27.680
I'm going to the office to get
a systems guy on this. Maybe Marty.

44:28.720 --> 44:29.840
What're you doing?

44:29.920 --> 44:31.120
Unplugging this.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.720
It's an open window.
He can crawl in any time he likes.

44:33.840 --> 44:37.280
He comes in, we grab him.
It's the only lead we've got.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.280
And what am l?

44:39.440 --> 44:41.320
The lamb tied to the stake?

44:41.480 --> 44:44.600
This is the only space
that I have in the world.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.600
-You're not getting it.
-I'll get a guard here.

44:47.680 --> 44:49.320
I don't want a guard here!

44:49.400 --> 44:50.520
All right.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.920
-We're all working together.
-I'm not.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.160
I'm not working with anybody.

44:55.680 --> 45:00.200
Turn the monitor back on and I'll stay
until we figure out what's happening.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.440
-Go on.
-Catch you later.

45:03.480 --> 45:04.600
All right?

45:05.720 --> 45:06.880
Heil, Hitler.

45:16.720 --> 45:20.480
I don't think he's going to send us
anything tonight. He's too busy.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.320
You want a drink?

45:26.840 --> 45:28.080
No, thank you.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.560
On duty?

45:30.360 --> 45:31.560
Always.

45:33.040 --> 45:34.160
So....

45:35.320 --> 45:37.880
What about you and the wee inspector?

45:40.720 --> 45:42.200
What about us?

45:46.640 --> 45:47.840
Are you?

45:49.120 --> 45:50.400
We're partners.

45:50.680 --> 45:51.720
Partners?

45:51.880 --> 45:53.280
ln every way?

45:53.960 --> 45:55.000
Not yet.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.200
Self-confident.

46:00.320 --> 46:01.440
Actually, I'm...

46:01.520 --> 46:02.560
...shy...

46:02.880 --> 46:03.840
...selective.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.440
The trouble is I'm...

46:07.920 --> 46:09.560
...I'm finding myself....

46:11.000 --> 46:13.720
You're in the witness category, you see.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.840
ln better times, maybe.

46:35.640 --> 46:36.760
Peter!

46:41.080 --> 46:44.040
I've been calling and calling.
Didn't you hear me?

46:45.160 --> 46:47.120
You completely forgot about me.

46:47.760 --> 46:50.400
Very thirsty, weren't you,
my little sweetie?

46:51.040 --> 46:52.240
Come on.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.080
Are you teasing me?

46:54.200 --> 46:55.760
Naughty little boy.

46:56.760 --> 46:59.640
What are you doing?
Want to watch Letterman with me?

47:00.120 --> 47:01.520
Well, I could, but....

47:01.600 --> 47:03.720
I don't watch talk shows on my own.

47:03.800 --> 47:04.960
I know.

47:07.600 --> 47:08.800
Oh, go on.

47:08.920 --> 47:11.320
Go back to your silly little computers.

47:12.400 --> 47:13.520
Thanks.

47:14.520 --> 47:16.480
Haven't you forgotten something?

47:30.240 --> 47:31.360
I love you.

47:31.440 --> 47:32.760
Yeah, me, too.

48:47.760 --> 48:50.120
Look's like you're in a bit of trouble.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.720
I'm going to place my hand...

48:53.840 --> 48:55.160
...right here.

48:57.080 --> 48:59.360
I'm going to put my elbow right here.

49:00.720 --> 49:01.880
Just...

49:04.040 --> 49:05.080
...cut...

49:06.240 --> 49:07.280
...there.

49:09.040 --> 49:10.160
There, now.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.720
Didn't I say I'd take care of you?

49:13.840 --> 49:15.480
Goodness! You're so hot!

49:20.120 --> 49:22.920
This is going to hurt a little, I'm afraid.

49:24.640 --> 49:26.200
They claim they didn't see anything.

49:26.280 --> 49:29.240
You received a call from dispatch
at 6:35 a.m.?

49:29.480 --> 49:33.360
Correct. 6:35. The first unit arrived
about 15 minutes later.

49:33.560 --> 49:34.680
Great.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.640
Did you isolate the kids who found her?

49:36.760 --> 49:39.200
Yes, they're over on the side of the hill.

49:39.320 --> 49:41.200
How many of you knew her?

49:41.360 --> 49:43.000
We just danced with her.

49:43.120 --> 49:44.240
Really?

49:44.400 --> 49:46.280
You just met her tonight?

49:48.160 --> 49:49.120
Excuse me.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.400
Good afternoon.

49:51.880 --> 49:54.320
Did you stand too far
from your razor today?

49:55.360 --> 49:57.160
I was up all night with a sick friend.

49:57.280 --> 49:59.080
I want to talk to you.

49:59.440 --> 50:02.080
Have you got a thing going with MJ now?

50:03.040 --> 50:04.680
I don't believe you.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.840
Good God, man, you stink.

50:07.520 --> 50:10.320
Heavy date last night?
Are you screwing around on her already?

50:10.440 --> 50:11.640
What's wrong with you?

50:11.760 --> 50:14.720
Me? I'll tell you, you just treat her right.

50:15.880 --> 50:19.240
Don't go screwing around on her.
She doesn't deserve that.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.440
Remind me again why she dumped you.

50:28.520 --> 50:29.720
Why is he here?

50:29.800 --> 50:32.240
What do you see? Tell me what you see.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.120
There are stains.
So, she's been sexually assaulted.

50:37.760 --> 50:41.360
No defense wounds. No ligature marks
or bruising, like the others.

50:41.480 --> 50:42.680
Very cyanotic.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.280
Asphyxiation, huh?

50:44.400 --> 50:47.040
-Doesn't look like our guy.
-You don't think so?

50:47.160 --> 50:48.800
Look at her heels.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.720
There's abrasions, but no bleeding.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.680
-She's been dragged up here postmortem.
-Maybe.

50:53.760 --> 50:56.960
On this stuff we're not going to get
any prints or tracks.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.360
Long night?

50:58.480 --> 51:00.760
-Don't you start.
-What about her arms?

51:03.920 --> 51:05.400
There's needle marks.

51:05.520 --> 51:07.720
No tracks. Not a regular user.

51:07.880 --> 51:10.160
Probably so stoned,
she never knew what got her.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.360
Hope so.

51:11.760 --> 51:13.560
A lot of little hippie girls.

51:13.960 --> 51:17.480
They all want to make love.
They all want to be beautiful.

51:17.680 --> 51:19.240
That's your type, right?

51:20.560 --> 51:21.880
What're you doing?

51:22.000 --> 51:23.960
Want to be on the 6:00 news?

51:24.080 --> 51:26.640
Go down and finish taking statements.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.560
Let's get out of here.

51:46.120 --> 51:48.320
I know. They found another one.

51:48.760 --> 51:50.720
What? Ruben told you already?

51:50.800 --> 51:52.680
I heard it on my scanner.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.280
-Can I use your phone?
-Sure.

51:55.840 --> 51:58.640
They want you to call the office?
Your phone is busted.

51:58.760 --> 52:00.400
You're some piece of work.

52:00.480 --> 52:03.520
I turned that damn scanner off,
and then I turned it on again.

52:03.600 --> 52:07.560
I can't listen to it, but I can't
not listen to it. So I make Andy do it.

52:07.760 --> 52:11.200
Are you on medication?
I need your whole brain on duty.

52:12.240 --> 52:13.640
I'm not on duty.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.440
Neither is my brain.

52:15.840 --> 52:18.200
Everything is different. Different guy.

52:19.120 --> 52:21.320
She was asphyxiated, not strangled...

52:21.440 --> 52:24.080
...dumped outdoors, sexually assaulted.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.680
So, nothing like DeSalvo.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.600
Completely different.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.480
Monahan. Messages, please.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.600
Why do you need me?

52:33.680 --> 52:35.400
I think I'm wrong...

52:35.920 --> 52:38.880
...because something was artificial
about it.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.360
Like posed. She was on display.

52:41.600 --> 52:44.560
Why drag a body
all the way up a huge hill...

52:45.240 --> 52:47.520
...where it will be found by tourists?

52:47.720 --> 52:50.160
You think he's changed his routine?

52:50.520 --> 52:52.240
That doesn't happen.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.600
These men are robotic.

52:55.800 --> 52:59.320
The murder's a ritual.
The method is part of the pleasure.

52:59.680 --> 53:01.560
Why is that computer off?

53:02.320 --> 53:03.640
Because I turned it off.

53:03.760 --> 53:05.160
You can't do that.

53:05.680 --> 53:07.240
I believe I can.

53:07.880 --> 53:10.600
-But would you like me to turn it back on?
-Yeah.

53:15.560 --> 53:16.760
Hello, Ruben.

53:16.960 --> 53:20.320
Please thank lnspector Goetz
for taking care of me last night.

53:21.400 --> 53:25.000
Dr. Hudson wants me to thank you
for taking care of her last night.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.440
Lab results on the new one.

53:35.240 --> 53:36.960
Two kinds of sperm.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.120
I guess that's...

53:40.240 --> 53:41.640
...a gang thing.

53:43.280 --> 53:45.320
Thanks for the use of your phone.

53:53.720 --> 53:55.600
There were two kinds of sperm?

53:58.600 --> 54:01.320
They said one was a secretor,
the other was not.

54:02.880 --> 54:04.520
How'd you know about that?

54:04.680 --> 54:06.480
There were needle marks?

54:10.000 --> 54:11.400
On her right arm?

54:13.000 --> 54:15.200
So far, nothing they test for
comes out positive.

54:15.280 --> 54:18.000
Was the body found
near a "No Dumping" sign?

54:19.280 --> 54:20.400
Like this?

54:23.560 --> 54:25.120
I could've taken that picture.

54:25.200 --> 54:26.920
Shit. He switched.

54:27.440 --> 54:30.080
From DeSalvo to Bianchi and Buono.
The Hillside Strangler.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.960
Two men. Two kinds of sperm.
Very witty, our guy.

54:33.320 --> 54:35.600
You said that they're like robots--

54:35.720 --> 54:38.760
Yeah, but "consistency
is the hobgoblin of small minds."

54:38.840 --> 54:43.040
Tell them to test for chemicals found
in window cleaner: ammonia, ethanol....

54:43.680 --> 54:45.720
It's what they injected into victims.

54:45.840 --> 54:48.320
Why these guys? Why in such detail?

54:49.520 --> 54:51.080
He wants to dazzle us.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.800
Anyone can strangle someone in a tub.

54:54.440 --> 54:56.240
He's saying, "Look out.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.440
"I'm just getting started."

54:58.680 --> 54:59.640
In San Francisco...

54:59.760 --> 55:02.640
...the mutilated body of an unidentified
young woman was discovered.

55:02.760 --> 55:04.560
Police have yet to comment
on the slaying...

55:04.680 --> 55:08.400
...which is the fourth such body
found in the last six weeks.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.040
Reporting live is Susan Schiffer.

55:11.280 --> 55:15.400
In response to growing alarm,
a special task force is being set up...

55:15.480 --> 55:17.280
...inside the Police Department.

55:17.360 --> 55:21.400
Aiding the police is noted
criminal psychologist, Dr. Helen Hudson.

55:21.760 --> 55:25.360
It was her expert testimony that
sent Daryll Lee Cullum to Death Row...

55:25.480 --> 55:27.120
...for the murders of two young women.

55:27.200 --> 55:31.160
Cullum later escaped and attacked
Dr. Hudson, killing a police officer.

55:31.320 --> 55:35.360
Meanwhile, schoolyards are empty,
college campuses are deserted...

55:35.520 --> 55:38.240
...and a terrified city locks its doors.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.760
Oh, hi. Sorry.

56:07.840 --> 56:10.320
I'm a little lost. Can you help me out?

56:10.760 --> 56:11.880
Yeah, sure.

56:15.920 --> 56:17.040
Thanks.

56:17.360 --> 56:20.880
We have a white female, early 20s,
found deceased in vehicle.

56:21.040 --> 56:24.000
Gunshot trauma to head.
Request CSU forensics and coroner.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.480
Backup is requested.

56:26.320 --> 56:27.520
Got you.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.200
It's a beauty.

56:29.360 --> 56:30.400
Great.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.160
I'll look at it soon.

56:41.480 --> 56:43.960
You thought you heard a backfire?
Where were you?

56:44.080 --> 56:46.960
I was just waiting to cross the street,
going east.

56:47.440 --> 56:48.760
Excuse me.

56:51.640 --> 56:52.760
Hi, it's me, Helen.

56:52.880 --> 56:54.600
Look, this isn't a good time.

56:54.720 --> 56:57.000
It's a woman shot in a car, right?

56:57.360 --> 56:59.480
No, it looks like a drive-by.

56:59.640 --> 57:02.840
She's in a parked car, shot in the head,
no sexual assault.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.320
Which side is she on?

57:04.400 --> 57:07.360
-Look, I really got to--
-Was it the passenger's side?

57:07.560 --> 57:08.600
Yeah.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.360
Was the tape player on?

57:10.440 --> 57:12.800
I don't know. Was the tape player on
when you got here?

57:12.880 --> 57:16.480
Yeah, it was. It was driving me crazy,
so I shut it off.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.720
Okay. Switch it on, would you?

57:21.840 --> 57:22.480
It's still warm.

57:22.600 --> 57:25.720
Don't laugh, but I think it might be
the Partridge Family.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.760
Put the tape player on.

57:28.920 --> 57:31.480
Helen thinks it might be
the Partridge Family.

57:38.480 --> 57:39.960
Don't hang up.

57:40.400 --> 57:42.280
Is a gas station nearby?

57:43.600 --> 57:45.320
With a phone booth?

57:45.520 --> 57:47.000
Go look for a note.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.960
Here. I got to go check the pay phone.

58:16.400 --> 58:18.280
It's Berkowitz, isn't it?

58:20.120 --> 58:21.840
He's doing Son of Sam.

58:22.480 --> 58:25.680
She was sitting in a parked car
when she was shot.

58:26.360 --> 58:27.680
Look in the crowd.

58:27.760 --> 58:30.200
Berkowitz liked to watch cops work.

59:14.560 --> 59:16.280
Helen, we found a note.

59:16.720 --> 59:19.920
It says, "Police, let me haunt you
with these words: I'll be back."

59:20.040 --> 59:21.240
It's to Helen.

59:21.320 --> 59:22.800
I'm going over there.

59:23.720 --> 59:28.080
I know it's kind of late, but Ruben's
going to drop by with a few questions.

59:28.240 --> 59:30.800
Look, I've got to go, so I'll see you later.

59:38.080 --> 59:39.960
lnspector Monahan, Homicide.

59:42.720 --> 59:45.360
I need a 10-25 to Pier One, Fort Mason.

59:45.960 --> 59:48.320
Approach Code 2. Wait for instructions.

59:48.560 --> 59:51.160
Alert the officer on security duty there.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.760
Just steal the car and go.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:26.920
Burt?

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.240
I'll deal with you later, asshole.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.240
You must think I'm a complete moron!

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.560
Until we know better,
I say the guy's just a junkie.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.720
A junkie?

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.400
ln a full-on SWAT suit?
Ruben, you're such a lousy liar.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.240
Are you sure nothing's missing?

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.560
Yes, there is! The cop
who was supposed to be at my door!

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.560
Where was he?

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.800
He screwed up. That's not the point.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.320
It is! You dragged me into this,
you're supposed to protect me.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.760
What're you doing?

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.360
I'm checking the bed!

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.960
That man is in and out
when he feels like it!

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.720
We got here as quickly as we could, okay?

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.080
Fortunately--

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.160
Why is that? Why did you come
to my rescue so fortuitously, huh?

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.000
There was a note, wasn't there?
At the gas station.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.640
I was right. What'd it say?

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.040
You think the guy's been in here before?
You said that.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.440
I don't know.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.560
Someone came and messed
with my clothes.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.720
And they put this red suit of mine
on the bed.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.280
Anything special about it?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.600
It was the one I was wearing...

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.400
...at the lecture hall.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.640
Why didn't you report it?

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.240
I didn't know.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.880
I thought it was me, you know....

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.920
I had taken a lot of pills
and I had been drinking.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.840
I just didn't know.
I wasn't sure then, but I am now!

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.880
So stop pretending to me
that it's a burglar!

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:28.320
Stop treating me like I'm some
fucking idiot! Tell me the truth!

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.920
I think the man who has killed
five women in this city...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.720
...was just in your apartment.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.440
I don't know why.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.560
But I do know he has a plan,
and you seem to be a part of it.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:51.040
The truth is he's very smart,
and he's way ahead of us.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.640
And I take it your moving is
out of the question?

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.960
So, all I know to do...

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.880
...is run the usual checks,
change your locks, tighten security...

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.240
...and pray.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.360
Feel better?

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.200
No.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.840
But I appreciate your candor.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.400
When do I get to see this note?

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.240
"Once that you've decided on a killing

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.480
"First you make a stone ofyour heart

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.680
"And ifyou find
that your hands are still willing

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.800
"Then you can turn a murder into art

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.920
"There really isn't any need for bloodshed

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.440
"Just do it with a little more finesse

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.800
"Ifyou can slip that tablet
into someone's coffee

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.800
"Then it avoids an awful lot of mess

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.960
"Because it's murder by numbers

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.320
"One, two, three

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.560
"It's as easy to learn

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.440
"As your A-B-Cs

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.160
"It's murder by numbers"

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.320
Good morning, Commissioner.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.080
Good morning.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.520
Murder By Numbers, by The Police.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.720
Obviously, the killer wants us to hear
this song for reasons other than...

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.600
...music appreciation.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.680
Familiarize yourselves with the lyrics.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.680
We need to figure out
what he's trying to tell us.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.840
I think that about covers it. Anything else?

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.480
Yes, lnspector?

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.480
We're set up on Helen's phone line
so we can monitor calls...

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.800
...and anything coming to her modem.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.720
Questions?

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.280
He is not a happy camper.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.000
-The Hudson broad.
-What about her?

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.760
The commissioner thinks, and I agree,
that she's leaking like a rusty bucket.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.600
Maybe she's trying to hype her new book.
I don't know.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.800
She's just not reliable.
Especially after lunch.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.000
She has been really useful to us
on this case.

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:28.920
I don't want you discussing
this case with her...

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.240
...in any shape, way or form.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.000
Do I make myself clear?

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:33.800
Crystal, sir.

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:49.680
Did that help any?

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.120
You don't feel fear, do you?

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.600
One of those people who thinks
everything happens for a reason.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.600
And we're all "God's chillun."

01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.760
How nice.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.640
I put my ass on the line
to bring you that letter.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.319
Are you gonna help me or not?

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.279
"Helen, don't lose your head."

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.960
So, we're on a first-name basis.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:18.080
Is it a threat?
Does he want to cut off my head?

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.680
Dahmer cut off heads.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:21.960
Kemper.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.800
I think Rifkin did.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.680
I'm sorry. It's difficult.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.720
It's okay. Take your time.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.319
"First you make a stone of your heart."

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.319
That's the first step: dissociation.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.439
He's saying he's suffered.
Now it's our turn.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:46.960
What made a stone of his heart?

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.080
Usually it's rejection or humiliation
by a parent.

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:52.600
Gacy's father beat him for fun.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.680
Kemper's mother locked him
in a cellar when he reached puberty.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.880
Something happened to this one.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.200
Are these his first killings?

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.480
I think they are.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.400
He's thought about them.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.120
This guy's copycatting.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.880
He wants what those killers got.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.360
Fame, the power to terrify us....

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:16.560
To take whoever, whatever he wants
without saying, "Please. "

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.560
"And if you find that your hands
are still willing, you can turn murder...

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.040
"...into art."

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.920
He wants us to think
what he's doing is art.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.680
We're looking for someone
desperate for acceptance.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.320
Probably has a fair academic record.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.040
And I think has a technical job.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.960
Something that demands
a certain precision.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.560
"Flushed with your very first success...

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.160
"...you must try a twosome
or a threesome...

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.600
"...and you'll find your conscience
bothers you much less."

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.400
A gruesome twosome.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.280
Kemper did two in one day.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.960
Bundy did three.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.800
Boston Strangler, Hillside Strangler....
Does the order mean anything?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.800
It's not chronological.
Son of Sam was before Hillside.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.640
He's sending you letters
like he's daring us to nail him.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.080
If he wants to be famous,
he must be caught.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.280
So you can write a book about him.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.400
Good grief.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.640
Thanks. Stick around.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.200
It's lousy, but it's hot.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:53.560
Thanks.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.080
Are you all right?

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.720
He burnt the print off the finger.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.360
What a surprise.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.840
He used it as a bookmark.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.520
The chapter where Daryll attacks
the doctor.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:11.160
We know that Mr. Cullum was safe
in San Quentin last night, so...

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.440
...why did this book
show up under the mattress?

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.280
I'll call you one better.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.520
It's autographed.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.920
"Hey Doc, hope you like the book.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.880
"Love and sloppy kisses,
Daryll Lee Cullum."

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.840
What a cuddly!

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.920
I know what you'll say.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.960
I'll do the talking.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.320
How you doing?

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.680
I want you to look
into this little camera here....

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.920
Now I want you to speak
into this microphone.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.920
She'll see me through that?

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.440
-How she gonna hear me?
-Speak into the microphone.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.200
Hello.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.640
Hey, Doc.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.080
I'm lnspector Monahan.
I'll be speaking for Dr. Hudson.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.600
I'm hanging up.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.480
I ain't talking to a cop.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.000
Dr. Hudson just got your book.
Do you know anything about it?

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.000
I surely do, but...

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.720
...that's all I'll say till that foxy lady
gets on the horn.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.000
Put her on.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.240
Hello, Mr. Cullum.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.360
Doc!

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.360
I've been expecting your call.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.520
From one author to another,
how'd you like my book?

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.760
What do you know
about the man who delivered it?

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.000
Peter Kurten?

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.440
What about him?

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.160
Peter Kurten?

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:48.400
Peter Kurten is the name of a serial killer
from the 30s in Germany.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.760
Damn, he took that man's name.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.360
Is he bothering you?

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.400
He broke into my apartment
to leave your book.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.120
Kind of a hand-delivery?

01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.920
Did you put him up to it?

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.440
This guy, he's written me all these letters.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.600
I figured he owed me a couple of favors.

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.400
So I sent a book with him to your house.
I didn't think he'd break in.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.960
Steer clear of him. He's a freak.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.440
He told me he's going to send me
$500 for some of my...spirit.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.840
He said that he can make me immortal
if he had some of my spirit.

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.680
You know what I'm saying?

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.120
This is embarrassing.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.600
I don't want to say it right out
in front of a lady.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:35.040
I think I know what you're referring to.
What did you do about it?

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.880
I took some liquid soap,
put it in a sandwich baggie...

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.800
...with a message from Jesus
to mend his ways.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.680
How will you contact Kurten?

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.400
Buddy of mine got paroled.
I'll send the baggie with him.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.080
Kurten will hook up with him.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.560
Do you know when and where?

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.040
All depends.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.000
Depends on what?

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.080
It gets awful lonesome in here, Doc.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.920
I think about you all the time.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.440
A personal token would be nice.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:06.600
Let's see...

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.880
...something...

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.360
...feminine...

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.840
...something lacy, something frilly,
something pretty.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.320
I got it.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.080
Send me some ofyour squirrel covers.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.480
I beg your pardon?

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.520
"I beg your pardon?"

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.160
Your panties.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.080
You wear them, don't you?
That's what I want.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.720
I want them autographed to me personally:

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.800
Daryll Lee Cullum. Deal?

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.520
That's a promise.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.280
My buddy's meeting Peter tonight at 10:00
at the Danver Meat Packing Company.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.800
How's life?

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.040
How'd you like to get off
the Chinatown detail?

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.600
We have a lead.
I think we can get this guy.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.480
Yeah, I'll be right down.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.400
You've got to come talk to me,
because Jesus kept you alive for a reason.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.240
He knew Satan was in my heart,
raising my hand to kill you.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.800
And Satan knew I had a good six,
seven years of appeals...

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.360
...before they'd drop the cyanide tablets.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.840
And I'mjust like Jesus.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.440
I got disciples, too.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:22.960
They're dying to do whatever I ask them,
as long as Ijust say the word, Doc.

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.160
I'm death and life to you, Doc.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.880
Death and life.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.120
-I speak Mandarin. They're Cantonese.
-How can I get a statement?

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.840
I wish I could help.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.560
I'll do anything you want.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.640
You speak English?

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.400
You speak any English?

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.520
Let's go. Get up.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.880
Fuck you.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.480
Get your hands off me!

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.920
We're out of here, babe.
Say good night to Hal.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.560
Good night.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.760
You're going out in public like that?

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.320
Festival of Love. Power to the people.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.320
-Hang loose.
-Heavy. Far out.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.000
Like, psychedelic.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.120
Doughnut?

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.480
Behave.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.480
I'll send you to your room.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.400
There's only glazed.
You can't have the chocolate.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.000
Everybody take it easy.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.360
Hold the gun down so it doesn't go off.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.640
Put up your weapons!

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.040
Weapons up.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.760
Easy, easy. Put the gun down.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.960
Tell him to put the gun down.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:37.920
I don't know how to say that.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.320
Take it easy.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.040
Nobody out that door!

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.480
Freeze!

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.360
-I'm a juvenile!
-Don't move!

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.760
It's weird, you know....

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.720
You think you're going to crash your car...

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.280
...or go out in a blaze of glory
with some big bad guy.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.080
And what happens?

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.600
Some jerk...

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.200
...forgets to lock his stupid drawer.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.480
I can't tell you how many times
I saw the two of you together....

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.640
I'd see you with your heads together.
He'd be making some kind of dumb joke.

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.360
I wished....

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.080
I wished him dead.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.920
Every time.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.880
You know what?

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:03.080
The strange thing is,
I'd really give my life right now...

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.680
...to bring him back.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.360
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.040
Terrible trouble.

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.840
Who gives a fuck?

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.920
I give a fuck.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.560
You know that in all the years
I've known you...

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.440
...I've never seen you cry.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:56.040
He's on paid leave. I managed
to talk the commissioner out of no pay.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.760
You take his, you take mine.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.600
Now I'm supposed to lose
three good cops in one day?

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:07.640
Sir...

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.880
...I tried to control the situation.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.280
I tried to control it. I made a choice.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.880
It didn't work out.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.840
An officer got killed.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:31.240
You made a decision,
and it was the right decision.

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.520
You just got the wrong result. That's all.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.680
You go out and you get drunk.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.640
I am.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.000
We missed him.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.280
Jesus Christ! How'd that happen?

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.800
It was my fault.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.560
I was so stupid.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.040
We had a problem with....

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.400
Ruben's dead.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.680
-Come in.
-No, really. I'm okay.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.360
I thought you should hear it
from somebody...

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.840
...instead of seeing it on the news,
because...

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.240
...I know that you and he had...

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.480
...a thing.

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.160
No, we didn't.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.560
He was a...

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.000
...sweet man.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.800
I thought of him as a boy.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.880
-Come in.
-No, I'm okay.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.160
Come in for just a sec.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.880
Answer the phone.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.800
Let me tell you something.

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:42.040
Nine out of ten serial killers
are white males...

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.040
...aged 20 to 35,just like these.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:50.400
The FBI estimates that there could be
as many as 35 serial killers...

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.320
...cruising for victims even as I speak.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.080
Peter Kurten?

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:17.800
Bitch!

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:44.360
Get the tap on Hudson's phone
and see if it traced a call two minutes ago.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.320
There's a tap on my phone?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.560
Yeah, just this second.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.600
Don't argue. Just do it.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.920
Is it possible this guy was a student
of mine?

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.880
Where'd you give this lecture?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.200
All over the country. Dozens of times.
It was my stock lecture.

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.640
When was the last time you gave it here?

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.280
Would have been last year, just before....

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.360
I'm getting it.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.800
That's it. That's the order I gave it.

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.600
"DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
Berkowitz, Dahmer." Dahmer's next.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.760
Which means he'll kill a man
and after that--

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.560
He'll do Ted Bundy.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.000
The Sound Factory? Perfect.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.480
I know where it is. I'm going now.
Give me some backup.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.160
Just maybe....

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:31.720
Maybe.

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.040
He's going to do Ted Bundy next.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.560
That was the last name on the list.

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.840
He'll pick the most extravagant murder.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.360
The song talked about a threesome.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.560
Bundy killed three girls in one night
at that sorority house...

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.600
...Chi Omega.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.720
He faked injuries.

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.480
He wore a cast on one arm,
and he used crutches...

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.440
...and he asked the girls for help.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.240
He drove...

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.240
...a very distinctive car. It was a....

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.840
Gold VW Bug.

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.960
We need to get on the DMV.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.920
We want records on all gold
or tan-colored VW Bugs, any year.

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:49.880
I want an in-person check
on every registered owner.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:56.520
Anyone who's registered a gold, yellow,
tan or any light-colored VW Bug.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:00.080
Contact campus security
at every college within 50 miles.

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.600
They need to warn all female students,
especially those with long hair...

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.000
...to avoid any contact
with males they don't know.

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.360
Report any man with an injury
or a handicap.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.240
DMV printouts of all Bug owners.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.640
Beautiful.

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:40.240
That's him.

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:44.880
He gave him the drink,
they went onto the dance floor and....

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.320
You're absolutely sure?

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.600
Yeah, that's him.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.600
Peter Foley, Daly City.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.840
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.400
We've got him.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:28.640
Call the SWAT team.
I'm not taking any chances with this fuck.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.720
Kind of defeats the purpose
of my Miracle Bra but...

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.400
...who's looking?

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.080
You're onto him.

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.320
Good work.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.080
Just horseshit luck.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.520
I don't think so.

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.600
You take care out there. Okay?

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.520
Don't I always?

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.280
I love you.

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.440
You know?

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.840
I know.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.840
You're looking good, Team leader.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.040
This is a status "David."

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.400
Go, Team leader.

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.800
Peter Foley, this is the police.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.120
Come to the front door.

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.960
Come out with your hands
above your head.

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.640
Team leader, we have a fire
in the basement window.

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:45.520
This is status "George." This is go.

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:50.240
Lieutenant, can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:54.720
San Francisco Police developed evidence
that identified the killer...

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.920
...known in the media
as "The Copycat Killer"...

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.320
...as one Peter Foley,
who lived at this address.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.560
When Mr. Foley was asked
to step outside to be interviewed...

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.440
...it's believed that he set fire
to the residence.

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:20.440
Don't tell me you both want
to use the men's room.

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.720
Hiya, Helen.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.920
I got your invitation...

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.480
...and I accept.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.880
Helen, it's MJ.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.720
I'm sure you heard on your scanner
it was a mess.

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.280
I know it's late, but I'm coming over.

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.800
That's perfect.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.760
That is perfect, Helen.

01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.800
Sounds like we have company coming.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.200
I'm not going to lie to you.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.760
This is gonna hurt.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.960
This is lnspector Monahan, Homicide.

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.240
I'm at Pier One, Fort Mason. I've got
an officer down. I need assistance.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.760
Copy, Monahan.

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.880
Up we go.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.560
Oh, hi there.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.640
Wejoin our program already in progress.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.560
Inspector Monahan...

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.280
...don't you ever get tired...

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:40.560
...being a day late and $1 short?

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:46.040
You probably think I'm going
to slit her throat right now.

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.120
Cut my losses, so to speak.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.200
Wrong-o!

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.720
Do you really think
I'd get her all dressed up, so pretty...

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.960
...with no place to go?

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.640
Ifyou're a smart cop...

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.760
...you'll know where to find us.

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.280
And ifyou're a really smart cop...

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.240
...you'll come alone.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.080
Otherwise...

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.720
...it's "bye-bye Helen. "

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.520
See you.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.240
No, this is wrong.

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.440
Here we go, Helen.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.520
There we go.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.080
Much better.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.080
What about him?

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.640
Did I get the pose right?

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.160
Did the best I could from the photos.
Come on, help me out.

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:35.480
Which way was his head?
This way, or this way?

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.320
This way.

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.200
Good. Excellent.

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.520
Everything has to be just so.

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:49.640
God, Helen, I remember...

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:52.400
...watching you on the big screen.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.240
ln your red dress.

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.160
God, you looked huge.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.320
Look at you now.

01:39:58.480 --> 01:39:59.640
So sad.

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.720
But, look on the bright side.

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:06.280
I'm going to make you
the world's most famous victim.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.440
Guess what that makes me?

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:14.600
Did you know that more books have
been written about Jack the Ripper...

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:17.040
...than Abraham Lincoln?

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.400
It's a sick world...

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:28.920
...isn't it, Helen?

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:37.040
You are not to go in there alone.

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:39.000
You wait for proper backup.

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:41.160
And you acknowledge my order!

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.000
You stay out of that building
until backup arrives! You copy?

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.440
Absolutely, sir.

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.520
Careful, Helen.

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.080
See?

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.520
Now you've cut yourself, haven't you?

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.080
See, I've been practicing.

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.000
Want to know the trick?

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.760
Small...

01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.320
...incisions...

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.040
...with a fine...

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.840
...instrument.

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.080
That way...

01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.840
...I can make it last...

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:00.360
...for hours.

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.400
You will not believe
how long a minute can feel.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.320
Fuck you.

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:12.960
What?

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.920
You heard me, you little twerp.

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.200
You think I'm afraid of you?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.400
I know you are.

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.520
I know all about you.

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.040
You're just a sad...

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:25.800
...second-rate...

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.440
...boring, impotent little copycat.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.600
Watch it, bitch!

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.120
Or I will slice that smile off your face,
do you hear me?

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.400
-Daryll Lee couldn't get it up, either.
-Do you hear me?

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:54.240
I see, Helen. Nice try.

01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:57.120
Want to know a secret?

01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.160
I'm onto your trick.

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.720
I won't kill you fast.

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.200
No matter how much...

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.280
...you're gonna want me to.

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:22.960
Excellent.

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:25.240
Here's where Daryll Lee got sloppy.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:31.560
He wasn't expecting a second cop.

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:33.440
-But I am.
-I'm in here!

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.960
Helen, relax.

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:38.240
The other cop's collecting his pension.
So will she.

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:41.680
But if you warn her, I'll kill her.

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:53.880
This is lnspector Monahan.
I have a message for Quinn.

01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.080
Go ahead.

01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.480
Tell him...

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.320
...I'm sorry, I blew it.

01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:20.240
Now, that's my gun, isn't it?

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.760
What in the world are you doing...

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.240
...with my gun?

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.280
Get your ass over here.

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:31.280
Come on, Doc,
help me out in this situation.

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.920
What do I do? Do I stick her or shoot her?

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.720
Shoot her or stick her, huh?

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.120
Come on, help me.

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.880
You watch this, Helen. You watching?

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.840
Perfect symmetry here.

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.960
Get up here. You watching?

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.640
You watching this?

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:35.880
Helen, what are you doing? No!

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:39.560
Feet on here!

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:50.880
Damn it!

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.560
Good try, Helen.
But you don't get off that easy.

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.320
Come on, get up. Let's go.

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.840
Get up, bitch.

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.040
Shit!

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.480
Help us! Somebody!

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:37.600
Somebody!

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:38.800
Help us!

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.720
Looks like I cured the agoraphobia.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.200
Help us! Help!

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:54.040
Forget it!

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.240
Too late!

01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:58.600
Too late for you, Helen!

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.200
Put up your dukes!

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.400
What the fuck are you laughing at, bitch?

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.440
What are you laughing at?

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.360
What're you waiting for?

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:29.800
Go ahead.

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.320
Dear Conrad:

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.800
Thank you for your letter.

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.000
Praise the Lord.

01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:17.960
I know you must be so happy
that He chose to spare Dr. Hudson.

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:22.200
The Big Guy moves in mysterious ways,
don't He?

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:25.960
Itjust so happens I'm awaiting the arrival...

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:29.040
...of a pair of genuine
Helen Hudson undies...

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.160
...signed personal to me.

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:35.800
A real collector's item,
I'm sure you'll know.

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.120
They're yours.

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:41.160
But don't forget,
a disciple must be strong...

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.800
...if he is to succeed where others fail.

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:48.360
Peter strayed from the path
and the Lord smote him good.

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.880
So keep it simple.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.480
Then glory is yours...

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.840
...and "vengeance is mine"...

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.040
...as the Good Book says.

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:01.000
I know you'll get my meaning.

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.880
Happy hunting, partner.

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:10.480
