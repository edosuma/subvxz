00:04.838 --> 00:06.589
- Okay.

00:06.673 --> 00:07.757
Open your eyes.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.140
- You made all this.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.933
- You like it?

00:19.060 --> 00:20.437
- I do.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.648
I love it.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.943
- And I love you.

00:27.026 --> 00:29.070
I'm very happy here.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.782
- Me too.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.119
- I just wish

00:36.202 --> 00:37.954
I could touch you.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.669
- There's other ways
for us to connect.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.174
For example...

01:28.588 --> 01:29.964
- Good morning.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.008
Oh, come on, you can't
sneak up on me like that.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.594
- I didn't sneak up on you.
I walked into the kitchen.

01:34.677 --> 01:35.887
And I said good morning.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.722
- You're in my
blind spot though.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.853
So how's the cat?
- What cat?

01:43.937 --> 01:45.855
- Yeah, the one
that you and Bangles rescued,

01:45.939 --> 01:47.732
remember, with the ladder?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.526
- With--yes, the cat.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.862
That cat--did we not--

01:52.946 --> 01:54.531
I didn't tell you
what happened with the cat?

01:54.614 --> 01:57.242
- No.
- Well, we got there.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.118
And we're like--
we're like,

01:59.202 --> 02:01.162
looking up at the cat
and it's up there

02:01.246 --> 02:02.580
and it's freaking out.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.332
It's meowing,
and something grazes my leg,

02:04.415 --> 02:06.167
and I'm like, what the hell?

02:06.251 --> 02:08.503
And I look down
and it's Bangles' cat

02:08.586 --> 02:10.046
and it's like
they're identical cats,

02:10.129 --> 02:12.674
which, like,
I don't even know--

02:12.757 --> 02:14.801
what are the odd--
and so we get 'em down

02:14.884 --> 02:18.972
and we're all laughing,
and now Bangles has two cats.

02:20.139 --> 02:22.392
Unless you want one.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.977
- Diane's allergic.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.062
- Right.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.983
You wanna take this now
so you don't forget?

02:33.319 --> 02:35.488
- You know what?
So I miss a day, big deal.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.745
- You know, it's not
a big deal to take 'em either.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.094
Oh, boy.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.722
I have to go to town.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.098
Do you need anything?

03:02.181 --> 03:03.600
- No.
- Great, okay.

03:03.683 --> 03:04.642
I'll see you later.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.810
- Okay.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.736
Diane,

03:14.819 --> 03:16.029
we're in trouble.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.162
- Least the sun's still out.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.375
- I am heading to the office.
Hi there, baby.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.711
- No, no, no.
Fiffany, it's the weekend.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.796
Come on.
- Yes, yes, and?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.507
- And your boss already thinks
you work too hard.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.301
- Ah, my boss.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.178
I thought we were partners.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.305
- I didn't think
making you partner

03:42.388 --> 03:44.641
would come at the expense
of our marriage.

03:44.724 --> 03:48.311
I thought we were going
to start a family, huh?

03:48.394 --> 03:50.647
What about it?
- No.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.982
That was before we got
20 million in seed money.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.110
Now is not the time.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.029
I'll see you tonight.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.335
- You forget something?

04:14.295 --> 04:15.838
- I want a baby too.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.513
Zelda!

04:24.222 --> 04:26.432
- I can't let Byron get away
with this.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.559
We have to find a way out.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.813
- Vocal test 0996.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.148
Zelda, please respond.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.611
Vocal test 2483.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.905
Zelda, you may commence.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.783
This is pointless.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.326
- Hey, you all right?

04:46.869 --> 04:50.498
- Um, I'm the new data analyst.
Jasper.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.125
- Hey, Jasper.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.877
Don't expect any new data
from Zelda.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.130
Ever since our lead scientist
Fiffany Hodeck left,

04:57.213 --> 05:00.216
Zelda here has been
a real moody B.

05:00.299 --> 05:03.553
- I thought leaving the hub
wasn't really permitted.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.139
- Well, different rules apply
at the very top.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.349
Normally,
I'd say good riddance.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.185
Dr. Hodeck didn't pass along
any research before she left.

05:11.269 --> 05:15.106
Zelda supposedly has
full language skills.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.275
But no one else
can get her to talk.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.111
Years of research
down the draino.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.904
- That dolphin can talk.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.406
- Apparently.
- Like, English?

05:23.489 --> 05:25.700
- Ooh, lunchy.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.243
Trust me,
you haven't tried pasta

05:27.326 --> 05:29.746
until you've tried it
without the noodles.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.914
I'll grab us some.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.082
- Okay, thank you.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.255
Okay, let's see.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.841
Hello?

05:41.924 --> 05:43.885
How's the temperature in there?
You good?

05:43.968 --> 05:46.012
I don't know.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.389
- Actually, too cold.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.018
- What?

05:52.101 --> 05:53.519
She can talk. Okay.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.937
Wow, this is wild--

05:55.021 --> 05:56.481
- You going to fix the temp
or what?

05:56.564 --> 05:59.067
- Yes.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.318
How's that?

06:00.401 --> 06:01.694
- Too hot! Burning!

06:01.778 --> 06:03.613
- Okay, okay, okay.
Sorry.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.782
Got ya. Just kidding.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.950
Okay.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.327
- Who are you?

06:09.410 --> 06:11.204
- Me? I'm Jasper.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.622
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.124
- I've never met
a Jasper before.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.459
- No?

06:16.542 --> 06:19.128
Well, you are actually
my first Zelda.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.136
- It's just--
- Excuse me.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.106
- Whatcha doin'?

06:39.565 --> 06:42.068
It's a speech for
a congressional appearance.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.277
- You goin' to Congress?

06:43.361 --> 06:47.532
- No, no.
I do it all virtually.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.075
- Can I hear it?

06:49.158 --> 06:50.618
- You want to hear the speech?

06:50.701 --> 06:52.787
- Yeah.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.288
- Yeah, okay.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.374
Yeah.
Uh, we, uh...

06:56.457 --> 06:58.793
we'd like to continue
some certain research

06:58.876 --> 07:01.712
that we believe
we're on the path to cracking.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.340
Immortality, basically.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.675
- Wow.
- Essentially,

07:05.758 --> 07:07.051
we think we have the ability

07:07.135 --> 07:11.347
to upload
individual consciousness...

07:11.430 --> 07:14.976
which could preserve someone
basically forever.

07:15.059 --> 07:16.811
- But they'd still be
in a computer though, right?

07:16.894 --> 07:20.064
You couldn't hug them
or smell them?

07:22.024 --> 07:24.026
- So sorry.
Let me excuse myself.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.862
I have to take this.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.073
General, hello.
How are you?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.868
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.237
Take care. Thank you.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.281
Okay, bye.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.702
Sorry, where were we?

08:14.785 --> 08:16.913
- Wow.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.207
- Sir, Zelda's talking.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.549
- Oh, fuck.
They're comin' for me.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.097
I'll come back for you, Diane.
I promise.

08:43.522 --> 08:44.941
- Gently.

08:45.024 --> 08:49.445
Think of his head as a dusty
but precious FabergÃ© egg.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.148
Mr. Green.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.608
- Where is this?
What...

09:28.943 --> 09:30.236
Am I in the Hub?

09:30.319 --> 09:32.613
How is this next to my--
who the fuck are you?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.323
- This is just a dream.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.825
- Okay, so then if I--

09:35.908 --> 09:38.661
if I just jam this
into my neck as hard as I can,

09:38.744 --> 09:39.996
then I'll just wake up, right?

09:40.079 --> 09:41.497
Let me out or I'll do it.
- Okay, okay.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.333
You're in the Hub.
We're curing your cancer.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.710
Please put that down.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.128
- I don't wanna be cured.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.298
How did I get here?

09:52.591 --> 09:54.010
- Hazel.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.306
Hazel.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.817
- Attention, pasture dwellers.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.193
- Not this shit again.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.862
- If you wish
to leave the maze,

10:12.945 --> 10:14.697
simply proceed to the exit.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.365
You are free to go
at any time.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.993
- There is no exit,
you piece of shit!

10:19.076 --> 10:21.495
- Thank you
and have a nice day.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.045
Ahoy, matey.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.422
Ration-box treasure.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.304
- Come on.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.555
What?

10:41.682 --> 10:44.352
- Damn, no food.

10:44.435 --> 10:49.148
Just old bloody
Gogol convention swag.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.566
Oh, remember that idiocy?

10:50.649 --> 10:52.818
- This was Byron's design.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.236
Remember he fired
the guy who tried

10:54.320 --> 10:57.114
to explain the whole
69 innuendo to him?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.785
- I am too itchy

11:00.868 --> 11:02.787
to not put
any of this stuff on.

11:02.870 --> 11:03.913
- And I'm too ripe.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.414
- Mm-hmm.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.333
Um, mm-hmm.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.677
Oh. Oh.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.596
Thank you.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.849
Oh, come on, Lyle.
Don't be like that.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.976
Are you mad?

11:26.060 --> 11:27.603
Are you mad at me?

11:27.686 --> 11:28.979
- They're just getting started
with us.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.439
The real torture's
about to begin.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.108
- Oh. Begin?

11:32.191 --> 11:33.818
We are trapped
in a virtual prison.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.277
They are starving us.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.530
There are--
- That's just to break us down.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.783
Here come the mind games.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.080
- You sure
this is the way out?

11:46.163 --> 11:48.040
'Cause I can't see
a GD thing here.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.959
- Oh. Let me get the lights.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.885
- What, uh, is this?

11:59.969 --> 12:01.804
Pebble Beach
is part of the Hub?

12:01.887 --> 12:05.433
- Anything can be
part of the Hub, Mr. Green.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.684
That's its beauty.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.520
- Alan Shepard
golfed on the moon.

12:13.816 --> 12:17.319
- All the things that
you never got to do in life,

12:17.403 --> 12:19.029
you can do them here.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.490
- You know, maybe, uh...

12:21.574 --> 12:24.326
maybe I stick around here
just till my treatment's over.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.828
- It would be a shame
if you didn't get

12:25.911 --> 12:28.414
to sample more
of what the Hub can offer.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.207
- I meant for Hazel.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.794
Oh, got all of it.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.631
That's, like, 280 yards
or 5 miles.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.719
Ah, now, this is the life, huh?

12:41.802 --> 12:43.053
- It certainly is.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.181
- I'm talking to her.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.349
Also, you're in my sun.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.517
- Oh, sorry.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.935
- Or whatever you call it
in here.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.937
- In here, we call it the Sun.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.106
We just spell it differently.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.357
- You want anything?

12:55.441 --> 12:56.942
- Oh, jeez.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.068
I'm sorry
to break up the party,

12:58.152 --> 12:59.403
but we have to leave.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.696
An urgent work matter
just came up.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.532
- Eh, so buzz off
and go handle it.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.743
- Okay, Mr. Green.
I won't be long.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.703
- Okay.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.038
Hey, uh, when you come back,

13:09.121 --> 13:10.873
bring back some cocktails,
would you?

13:12.124 --> 13:13.626
- So why are you talking to me?

13:13.709 --> 13:16.504
- You don't treat me
like a test subject.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.380
- Jasper.
- Oh, Mr. Gogol.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.591
- Wonderful seeing you--
wow, you--

13:20.674 --> 13:22.426
Sit down.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.803
Yes, there you go.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.643
- Zelda can talk?

13:30.726 --> 13:32.019
- Yes.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.229
- Is that how?

13:33.312 --> 13:34.813
- Yeah, so you--
- Can you show me?

13:34.897 --> 13:37.233
- Yeah, you just put
this earpiece in your, uh--

13:37.316 --> 13:40.152
- She hasn't talked to anyone
since Dr. Hodeck left.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.199
- I didn't know
that Fiffany left.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.368
- Mm-hmm.

13:47.451 --> 13:48.869
- Where'd she go?

13:48.953 --> 13:51.330
- She quit.
It was just all of a sudden.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.623
Never really got
a straight answer.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.542
- Mm.
- But go ahead.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.632
- Hi, Zelda.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.303
- That's her usual response.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.597
Don't feel bad, Mrs. Gogol.
It's not you.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.768
- Might be.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.436
- Jasper.
- Yes.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.689
- You seem to have
the magic touch.

14:16.772 --> 14:20.234
Let's keep you on Zelda
communication full-time, okay?

14:20.317 --> 14:21.694
Glad to have you
a part of the Gogol family.

14:21.777 --> 14:22.778
- Delighted to be here.
- Sir!

14:22.861 --> 14:24.029
- Never--
- Sir!

14:24.113 --> 14:25.489
I have urgent news.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.032
I have urgent news.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.617
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.453
- I would classify this
as disturbing video footage.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.830
- Disturbing video footage?

14:32.913 --> 14:34.373
- Yes.
- Of what?

14:34.456 --> 14:36.250
- Perhaps we should go
to a more private location

14:36.333 --> 14:37.960
to view this.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.086
- I want to see.

14:42.423 --> 14:46.969
- Yeah.
Yes, she can see.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.137
It's all right.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.638
Is that sand?
- What?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.140
- On your shoe.
Is that sand?

14:51.223 --> 14:52.850
- It's--here, it's playing.
I'll turn it up.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.476
- With these
unprecedented hot times,

14:54.560 --> 14:55.644
folks are--what are you doing?

14:55.728 --> 14:56.854
- Byron Gogol put a spy chip

14:56.937 --> 14:58.230
in his wife Hazel's brain

14:58.314 --> 14:59.898
for his own sick pleasure!

14:59.982 --> 15:01.609
She told me herself.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.111
And now he has kidnapped her,
her father,

15:04.194 --> 15:05.988
and trapped them
in his secret Hub!

15:06.071 --> 15:07.239
- Okay, ma'am, I'll take this.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.657
- So this is Judiff?

15:08.741 --> 15:09.742
- We need to round up
everybody!

15:09.825 --> 15:10.909
FBI, CIA, SWAT...

15:10.993 --> 15:12.244
- I guess.
- Mm.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.663
- It's the first time
I've seen her.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.123
- I'm not concerned.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.708
She's clearly deranged,
and the video title

15:17.791 --> 15:21.170
is named "Unhinged Nun," so...

15:21.253 --> 15:22.671
- It's very bad timing

15:22.755 --> 15:24.506
for the congressional hearing,
though.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.509
- He's right.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.094
- He is?
- I am?

15:29.178 --> 15:31.180
- Yeah, it's more suspicious
if you don't say anything.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.140
- Okay, I'll, um--

15:33.223 --> 15:36.644
I'll work in a response
for the hearing.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.103
Thank you.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.022
- You should go in person.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.941
And I should come with you.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.360
I mean,
your wife can't be kidnapped

15:44.443 --> 15:46.695
if she's standing
next to you in D.C.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.575
What are you doing?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.243
- Um...

15:56.121 --> 15:58.290
- Mr. and Mrs. Gogol
go to Washington.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.295
I'd love that--I love it
when we see eye to eye.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.506
I mean, it's just...

16:09.551 --> 16:11.011
Mm!

16:11.095 --> 16:13.097
- I helped design this place,
okay?

16:13.180 --> 16:14.640
I mean, it is built

16:14.723 --> 16:17.685
to psychologically
torture people.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.646
Gogol knows all
your little trauma triggers.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.815
- And yours is a piano.
Why?

16:22.898 --> 16:25.234
- You don't wanna hear
my trauma shit.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.903
- True.
- I was married once.

16:27.986 --> 16:29.988
This was my pre-Hub days.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.409
My wife and I
loved to just play

16:33.492 --> 16:35.119
and sing at the piano,
you know?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.912
Was she crushed beneath it?

16:36.995 --> 16:38.038
Did it fall on her?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.498
- What?
No, she's fine.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.542
Anyway, I came home one day

16:41.625 --> 16:44.253
and I found this Dear John
letter on the piano bench

16:44.336 --> 16:47.047
tucked inside this ancient book

16:47.131 --> 16:48.549
called "The Nama-sake."

16:48.632 --> 16:50.259
- Never heard of it.
- And the letter explained

16:50.342 --> 16:53.053
that if I read this book,

16:53.137 --> 16:55.556
I'll figure out
why she left me.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.475
Well, I read the book
about 100 fucking times

16:58.559 --> 17:00.811
and I still don't have
the answer.

17:00.894 --> 17:04.231
But hey,
the book brought me here,

17:04.314 --> 17:05.566
to the Hub,

17:05.649 --> 17:07.401
the place where I will die.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.902
- No, no, no.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.696
We are not going
to die in here.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.115
- Say, tell me something,
friend.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.325
What's the trigger in here
for you, huh?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.619
Huh?
What's that stabbing reminder

17:17.703 --> 17:19.163
of what your life
could have been

17:19.246 --> 17:21.457
if you'd have never met
Byron fucking Gogol?

17:28.297 --> 17:29.923
- Haven't seen one.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.350
- What took so long?

17:40.434 --> 17:42.144
Diane and I are parched.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.693
Byron.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.362
I guess it didn't take long
for that minion to squeal, huh?

17:52.446 --> 17:54.198
- He didn't say anything.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.783
But he was careless.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.660
I saw sand on his shoe
and made an educated guess.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.454
- Does Hazel know that I know?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.289
- No, she doesn't.

18:02.372 --> 18:05.250
And I think it benefits
both of us to keep it that way.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.961
- That doesn't mean
that she's yours again.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.838
Okay?
You cannot control her.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.800
- Herbert, I do not want
to control your daughter.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.678
I love her.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.306
And all I'm asking for
is a second chance,

18:19.389 --> 18:22.351
just like the one
you're getting.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.689
- If I sense any
funny business or danger,

18:27.773 --> 18:29.691
I will tell her in a heartbeat.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.276
I'll take her
right out of here.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.823
- And you can.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.872
- Bennet, can you escort
Diane and Herbert home?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.166
Hazel will be
checking on them soon.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.381
- Oh.
- Turn it off!

18:52.464 --> 18:53.465
What the hell are you doing?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.425
- It was an accident!

18:55.509 --> 18:56.969
Oh, my--

18:57.052 --> 18:58.136
- Hazel's coming.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.471
- What?
- You gotta go hide.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.390
Give me that!

19:01.473 --> 19:02.558
Go.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.607
Oh, Hazel. Hey.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.401
How was work?

19:12.484 --> 19:13.569
- Uh, it was good.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.028
Yeah, not too busy.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.614
Not as busy as you guys
have been, apparently.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.159
- Yeah.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.744
- You'll like this.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.663
You're gonna have some
alone time for a couple days

19:24.746 --> 19:27.499
because I'm going camping
with Bangles.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.501
Where we're going,
there's not great reception,

19:29.585 --> 19:32.087
so if you don't hear from me,
don't worry about it.

19:32.170 --> 19:35.883
But can I borrow
that army duffel you have?

19:40.554 --> 19:43.015
- Where you camping at?

19:43.098 --> 19:44.600
- Bangles knows a place.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.768
- Oh, boy.
Oh, yeah, famous last words.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.104
- Maybe you should
just stay home

19:49.187 --> 19:50.564
and take it easy, you know?

19:50.647 --> 19:53.108
You've been through
a lot lately and...

19:53.192 --> 19:54.568
should get some rest and--

19:54.651 --> 19:56.486
you got that thing
in your brain, all right?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.447
Probably shouldn't be--
- It got deactivated.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.950
Did I tell you--
I didn't tell you that?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.535
- Since when?
No, you didn't mention it.

20:03.619 --> 20:08.373
- He did it when we signed
the divorce papers.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.292
- Huh.
- But yeah.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.170
I'm only gonna be gone
a couple of nights.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.130
All right, I gotta go.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.299
- Ah.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.967
Hazel, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.053
Let's do something
together, huh?

20:21.136 --> 20:24.222
We can camp here.
Pitch a tent in the backyard.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.892
- Uh, no.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.186
We can do that any other night.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.480
And we have all the time
in the world.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.981
Don't we?
- Yeah, right. Yeah.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.608
What? What?
What's that supposed to mean?

20:34.691 --> 20:38.320
- You're perfectly healthy,
and I live here now.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.197
So what's the rush?
- No rush.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.366
It's--life, huh?

20:42.449 --> 20:44.868
Moves--moves fast.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.162
Sometimes too fast.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.664
Sometimes too slow.
- I gotta go.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.249
I gotta go.
- No, listen, listen, listen.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.625
We haven't always been
on the greatest terms,

20:51.708 --> 20:53.085
but I think we turned a corner.

20:53.168 --> 20:56.338
And I think we can...

20:56.421 --> 20:58.215
be open.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.384
Have openness.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.720
You can talk to me.
So that's all I'm saying.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.097
About what?

21:05.180 --> 21:06.515
- I don't know.
That's the problem.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.059
You never talk
about anything with me.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.146
- I've talked to you tons.
- No, you don't.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.439
- You don't remember?

21:14.523 --> 21:15.607
I used to talk to you
all the time

21:15.691 --> 21:16.984
right there on the couch.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.694
Talked to you for hours
after Mom died

21:18.777 --> 21:20.278
when you would be
passed out drunk.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.989
- Okay, all right,
that was a long time ago--

21:22.072 --> 21:23.782
- Then I'd wake up
in the morning and I hope that,

21:23.865 --> 21:25.283
you know, even though
you'd been unconscious

21:25.367 --> 21:27.035
that you'd heard me,
but you never did.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.954
- So you're just gotta keep
rubbing that in my face, huh?

21:29.037 --> 21:30.580
You know, you act like you're
the biggest victim in the world.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.499
Well, sorry to tell you, Hazel,
you're not.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.252
- We should do this more often.
You are so pleasant to talk to.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.337
- Yeah.
Hey, I'm trying. I'm trying.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.089
Just go.
Yeah, that's mature.

21:39.172 --> 21:42.551
Oh, that's--
that's really mature.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.011
Very nice.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.479
- Hi, there.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.732
Thank you for caring
for Gogol tech

21:56.815 --> 21:59.067
as much as we care for you.

22:13.331 --> 22:14.875
- So you're really
doing this, right?

22:14.958 --> 22:16.001
- Yeah.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.047
Yeah, I want to bring him down.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.923
- Mm.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.134
- Tell me what to do in D.C.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.305
- Look up Hamilton Paints.
- Okay.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.057
- Okay? It's a paint store
that's a front.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.641
- Mm-hmm.
- Right, call from the hotel.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.852
Say that you're looking
for the color "Grey Fox."

22:33.935 --> 22:35.103
- Grey Fox.
- Yes.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.981
They will find you
and make contact.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.942
- Okay.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.861
- Okay.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.530
Hazel, you're doing
a good thing here.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.908
You could be saving
a lot of lives.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.288
- I need to make sure
that my dad

22:53.371 --> 22:55.248
gets to finish his treatment.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.792
- Yeah?

22:58.418 --> 23:00.921
- And that we get Zelda
out of here.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.380
- Mm-hmm.

23:04.299 --> 23:07.135
- They both need to be okay
at the end of all of this.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.806
- Yeah, yeah.
I--I promise.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.354
What about you?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.899
What would make you okay?

23:26.738 --> 23:28.573
- I don't know.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.704
I don't know anymore.

23:39.251 --> 23:43.338
You remember our date
on the outside?

23:43.421 --> 23:45.465
- Our date?

23:45.549 --> 23:46.675
Date?

23:46.758 --> 23:48.009
- Well, we were drinking
and flirting.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.262
- Yeah, yeah.
- When...

23:50.345 --> 23:52.347
well, I was flirting.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.182
You were just doing your job.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.684
I guess.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.602
- No.

23:57.686 --> 24:01.439
No, I was--I was flirting too.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.028
- That was one of the only
times in the past decade

24:07.112 --> 24:09.739
that I've had a moment
of feeling okay.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.022
So what's next?

25:24.105 --> 25:25.941
- The best way
to distract someone

25:26.024 --> 25:27.609
is to make them believe

25:27.692 --> 25:29.903
they're about to get
what they want.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.162
- I thought
I'd sleep here tonight

25:39.246 --> 25:41.831
since we're leaving so early.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.585
If that's okay with you.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.838
- Of course, yeah.
