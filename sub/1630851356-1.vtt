<i>It is starting like this.</i>

01:24.214 --> 01:25.841
Let's keep looking.

01:25.924 --> 01:27.885
They aren't good enough.

01:29.094 --> 01:30.345
Let's take that girl.

01:30.428 --> 01:31.554
Which one?

01:31.639 --> 01:33.181
That girl. Zoey. Let's take her.

01:33.265 --> 01:34.557
Ah... No.

01:35.726 --> 01:37.144
What about that one?

01:37.227 --> 01:38.228
Him?

01:38.311 --> 01:39.312
Yes.

01:39.396 --> 01:41.523
<i>Our country is at war</i>

01:41.606 --> 01:43.859
<i>and we are having no more school.</i>

01:43.942 --> 01:47.195
<i>So we are having to be finding ways
to be keeping busy.</i>

01:59.541 --> 02:00.959
And what am I gonna do with this, Agu?

02:01.043 --> 02:02.460
It's a TV. I'm selling it.

02:02.544 --> 02:04.504
This dirty thing with no screen?

02:04.587 --> 02:05.588
Let's go!

02:05.673 --> 02:07.215
Soap opera.

02:07.299 --> 02:08.466
Be quick!

02:09.967 --> 02:11.385
Please, I love you.

02:11.386 --> 02:12.220
- Please, I love you.
- I don't love you.

02:12.304 --> 02:13.138
But why?

02:13.139 --> 02:14.556
- But why?
- Because you're not handsome. Go!

02:14.640 --> 02:15.473
Oh, please, I beg.

02:15.474 --> 02:16.684
- Oh, please, I beg.
- Don't follow me. Go!

02:16.767 --> 02:18.268
<i>I am having the ideas.</i>

02:18.351 --> 02:21.354
- Go!
- <i>And Dike is having the talent.</i>

02:23.774 --> 02:24.858
Dance! Dance! Dance!

02:35.118 --> 02:36.078
Kung fu! Kung fu!

02:36.079 --> 02:37.537
Kung fu! Kung fu!

02:39.957 --> 02:42.375
Yeah!

02:42.459 --> 02:43.585
Yes!

02:45.087 --> 02:47.130
It's garbage.
All of you go away!

02:47.214 --> 02:49.842
It's an imagination TV!
How can you say it's garbage?

02:49.925 --> 02:51.009
It's garbage, Agu.

02:52.594 --> 02:54.930
Don't worry, let's go.

02:57.265 --> 02:59.727
<i>We are living in a buffer zone.</i>

02:59.810 --> 03:03.146
<i>My father is saying,
"Outside, people are suffering,</i>

03:03.230 --> 03:04.982
<i>"but here we are safe."</i>

03:05.065 --> 03:09.194
<i>That is why so many refugees
are coming here small-small.</i>

03:19.496 --> 03:21.749
Master, master,
please, will you buy this TV?

03:21.832 --> 03:23.333
How am I supposed to watch this?

03:23.416 --> 03:25.335
This is imagination TV.

03:25.418 --> 03:28.005
<i>The Nigerians are keeping the peace.</i>

03:28.088 --> 03:30.257
It is imagination TV.

03:30.340 --> 03:34.261
<i>They are always buying things,
so they are easy to be selling to.</i>

03:35.303 --> 03:36.847
3D!

03:41.935 --> 03:44.813
Okay. How much for this treasure?

03:44.897 --> 03:46.106
Three thousand.

03:46.189 --> 03:48.358
Huh? Three thousand. Too much!
Thousand five.

03:48.441 --> 03:49.818
Thousand five no good.

03:49.902 --> 03:51.068
Two thousand. Two thousand.

03:51.069 --> 03:52.029
- Two thousand. Two thousand.
- Two thou.

03:52.112 --> 03:53.906
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Thousand five.

03:54.865 --> 03:55.698
Some food, some food.

03:55.699 --> 03:58.579
- Some food, some food.
- Bring out some of your food and take it.

03:58.952 --> 04:01.663
Uche, bring the foods and come.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.255
Here, take. Go!

04:30.776 --> 04:34.279
<i>I am a good boy from a good family.</i>

04:34.362 --> 04:36.573
<i>My mother is always working hard for us.</i>

04:36.656 --> 04:38.136
Taste this.

04:40.577 --> 04:41.703
Thank you.

04:42.537 --> 04:43.746
It's good.

04:44.790 --> 04:48.210
"B is for butterfly.

04:48.293 --> 04:50.295
"Sara, small..."

04:50.378 --> 04:51.587
"Soaring."

04:51.588 --> 04:53.298
- "Soaring."
- "Soaring overhead."

04:54.967 --> 04:56.634
Nice idea.

04:57.552 --> 04:59.012
<i>My father was a teacher.</i>

04:59.096 --> 05:00.097
Clap for him!

05:01.348 --> 05:03.475
That's good.
And another one!

05:05.477 --> 05:06.728
That's good.

05:06.812 --> 05:07.813
Agu!

05:07.896 --> 05:09.439
Where do lions live?

05:10.440 --> 05:11.441
In the zoo.

05:11.524 --> 05:12.860
Shame him.

05:12.943 --> 05:14.486
Shame!

05:14.569 --> 05:16.321
Who can tell me where lions live?

05:16.404 --> 05:20.325
<i>I like my father more
now that he's not my teacher.</i>

05:20.408 --> 05:23.578
<i>Since the war, he is a busy man.</i>

05:23.661 --> 05:25.956
<i>He is using some of our land</i>

05:26.039 --> 05:29.334
<i>so that the refugees
can be making a new village.</i>

05:30.335 --> 05:33.505
What we need now is medicine.

05:34.506 --> 05:35.715
<i>Big brother.</i>

05:35.798 --> 05:38.969
<i>He is more concerned
with his muscles and his hair.</i>

05:39.052 --> 05:42.764
<i>Sometimes I am adding to his soaps.</i>

05:45.267 --> 05:46.707
Stop that!

05:47.519 --> 05:49.021
When I get a hold of you...

05:49.521 --> 05:50.522
Leave me alone!

05:50.605 --> 05:51.606
You have no respect!

05:51.689 --> 05:54.692
I was trying to make it warmer for you!

05:54.776 --> 05:55.777
Leave me alone!

05:55.860 --> 05:58.155
You're lucky I don't shit on you.

05:58.238 --> 05:59.990
I'm gonna fart on your face.

06:00.073 --> 06:04.161
<i>Big brother is also
concerned with sleeping.</i>

06:04.244 --> 06:08.999
I want to sleep
with this girl before the war gets here.

06:13.962 --> 06:16.298
<i>I am not liking his music.</i>

06:16.381 --> 06:19.259
Let me go!
I didn't do anything to deserve this!

06:19.342 --> 06:22.012
<i>I am not liking his dancing.</i>

06:22.095 --> 06:25.098
<i>And how can that girl be sleeping
if he is making so much noise?</i>

06:25.182 --> 06:28.476
Let me go! I don't like this!

06:28.560 --> 06:32.439
Treat your neighbor as your brother.

06:32.522 --> 06:36.193
And treat the market vendor...

06:36.276 --> 06:38.570
as your mother or older sister.

06:38.653 --> 06:40.738
<i>My mother is always saying,</i>

06:40.822 --> 06:43.158
<i>"If you do not know what to be doing,</i>

06:43.241 --> 06:46.494
<i>"you can always be
asking God for the answer."</i>

06:46.578 --> 06:47.704
Say Amen!

06:47.787 --> 06:48.788
Amen!

06:48.871 --> 06:49.957
Say it louder!

06:50.040 --> 06:52.334
Amen!

06:54.002 --> 06:58.090
Choir, give us a song
and then we'll continue.

07:06.139 --> 07:08.766
<i>God is liking music
more than just talking.</i>

07:08.850 --> 07:13.855
<i>So if you are singing and dancing,
then he will be listening to us well-well.</i>

07:27.202 --> 07:28.954
Cut that branch.

07:29.037 --> 07:30.122
I'll fall.

07:30.205 --> 07:31.331
Just hold on tight and cut it.

07:31.414 --> 07:32.415
No way.

07:32.499 --> 07:33.666
Then cut that one instead.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.628
Have your lazy friend do it.

07:36.711 --> 07:37.795
He's the driver. Cut that one.

07:37.879 --> 07:40.132
You're too small, you'll fall!

07:40.215 --> 07:42.134
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

07:42.217 --> 07:43.551
- Go home!
- You go home!

07:43.635 --> 07:44.636
Midget.

07:45.637 --> 07:46.929
Cut it.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.057
He wants me to fall.

07:49.141 --> 07:51.351
If I was a taxi driver,
I'd drive around it.

07:57.983 --> 07:59.776
Get ready!

08:04.114 --> 08:05.115
What is this?

08:05.198 --> 08:07.617
We've been working all day.
Give us some money for our work.

08:07.700 --> 08:08.910
Why did you block the road?

08:08.994 --> 08:11.288
We are trying to fix it.

08:11.371 --> 08:13.206
Get out of here!

08:13.290 --> 08:14.332
But we need to eat!

08:14.416 --> 08:15.792
Take this.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.252
I don't want your chicken.

08:25.218 --> 08:27.304
Why are children so disrespectful?

08:27.887 --> 08:28.930
Huh?

08:29.014 --> 08:30.182
You!

08:30.265 --> 08:31.391
Curse be upon you.

08:31.474 --> 08:33.684
Curse yourself,
standing in the middle of the road.

08:33.768 --> 08:35.187
I know you very well!

08:35.270 --> 08:36.770
I know your whole family!

08:37.313 --> 08:38.898
You're thieves!

08:38.981 --> 08:40.817
You stole my land!
Me, an old woman!

08:41.443 --> 08:42.610
Do you want this chicken?

08:43.278 --> 08:46.864
The devil will bless you one by one!

09:03.798 --> 09:05.050
<i>Grandfather.</i>

09:05.133 --> 09:08.761
<i>The lights are on, but nobody is home.</i>

09:10.847 --> 09:13.183
We saw that witch woman today.

09:13.266 --> 09:15.768
She said we were thieves.

09:15.852 --> 09:17.770
Why would she say that?

09:17.854 --> 09:20.065
That woman...

09:20.148 --> 09:22.024
she's confused.

09:22.109 --> 09:24.194
God has taken her mind.

09:24.277 --> 09:26.279
Slow down.

09:27.239 --> 09:29.449
The land we gave to the refugees...

09:29.532 --> 09:31.951
has been in our family
since before your grandfather.

09:32.034 --> 09:34.204
I gave her a place, but she refused.

09:34.287 --> 09:35.413
So she's crazy?

09:44.046 --> 09:45.632
Ugh!

10:00.355 --> 10:01.398
What is this?

10:05.026 --> 10:06.653
Who did this to my TV?

10:10.198 --> 10:11.241
What is this?

10:13.075 --> 10:15.578
Agu! Agu!

10:45.900 --> 10:48.695
If I acted like you when I was your age,

10:48.778 --> 10:51.030
Dad would've beaten me.

10:51.113 --> 10:54.201
You're lucky there's a war.

10:54.284 --> 10:56.411
It's not luck, everybody loves me.

10:57.162 --> 10:58.455
Like who?

11:01.123 --> 11:02.834
There she is.

11:04.711 --> 11:05.962
She's looking at you!

11:06.045 --> 11:07.297
Really?

11:07.380 --> 11:08.381
Still?

11:08.465 --> 11:09.924
She looked away.

11:16.764 --> 11:18.324
Do you think she likes me?

11:18.350 --> 11:19.726
My eyes are not good.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.228
So you couldn't tell?

11:22.604 --> 11:24.021
You don't know what's up.

11:24.105 --> 11:28.025
When she sees these muscles,
she'll fall in love with me.

11:30.862 --> 11:33.656
<i>It would seem things are changing quickly</i>

11:33.740 --> 11:34.940
<i>within the interim government.</i>

11:34.991 --> 11:39.912
<i>As of this morning, the NRC junta
moved to abolish all political parties,</i>

11:39.996 --> 11:42.457
<i>further consolidating
their control of the government</i>

11:42.540 --> 11:45.126
<i>in the wake of
the recent military coup.</i>

11:45.209 --> 11:47.128
<i>Lieutenant General Sangania,</i>

11:47.211 --> 11:51.424
<i>commander-in-chief of the armed forces
responsible for the junta,</i>

11:51.508 --> 11:53.551
<i>stated in a recent press conference</i>

11:53.635 --> 11:57.597
<i>that it was his intention
to rid the southern regions of the PLF,</i>

11:57.680 --> 12:03.185
<i>who he accused of being financed
and supported by foreign institutions.</i>

12:03.270 --> 12:06.814
<i>He also condemned
the Native Defense Force militias,</i>

12:06.898 --> 12:12.069
<i>who he said presented a threat
to the very fabric of national security.</i>

12:12.153 --> 12:15.282
<i>Sangania went on to promise
that the junta would accomplish</i>

12:15.365 --> 12:18.535
<i>what the previous regime had failed to do.</i>

12:18.618 --> 12:22.872
<i>Speculation on the collaboration between
the armed forces and the PLF rebels...</i>

12:38.388 --> 12:41.068
<i>The NRC broke the agreement.</i>

12:41.516 --> 12:43.726
They've entered the buffer zone.

12:43.810 --> 12:47.271
Now they want us to run away
and leave our town.

12:47.355 --> 12:48.481
We cannot do that.

12:48.565 --> 12:50.232
Never.

12:50.317 --> 12:52.444
This land is ours.

12:53.110 --> 12:55.530
Our ancestors have lived here,
taken care of it, and left it for us.

12:55.613 --> 12:58.032
It's our duty to protect it...

12:58.115 --> 13:00.660
and leave it for our children.

13:02.745 --> 13:08.167
So we should send
the women and little children away...

13:08.250 --> 13:10.837
under the protection of ECOMOD.

13:12.630 --> 13:14.466
Where's Dike?

13:14.549 --> 13:20.472
And we who call ourselves men
will stay and protect our town.

13:22.181 --> 13:25.560
Who is going to take care of the property
we are leaving behind?

13:25.643 --> 13:27.269
Dad, where's Dike?

13:27.354 --> 13:28.521
They fled!

13:29.230 --> 13:34.068
Let me go, it's my duty.

13:37.238 --> 13:43.202
We will be crushed between
the rebels and the army! It is so bad!

13:43.828 --> 13:45.455
We've already decided

13:45.538 --> 13:46.539
what to do with the children.

13:46.623 --> 13:48.666
They will go with you.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.252
He is old. We can't take him anywhere.

13:51.335 --> 13:53.921
You aren't listening to what I'm saying.

13:54.005 --> 13:56.925
Go to your sister in the city, I'll meet
you once everything is okay here.

13:57.008 --> 13:58.175
I can't abandon my responsibilities.

13:58.259 --> 13:59.427
But you are!

13:59.511 --> 14:00.762
Don't think like that.

14:00.845 --> 14:03.014
You want me to be a refugee
in my own country?

14:03.097 --> 14:04.932
With three small children and no husband?

14:05.016 --> 14:06.434
We are a family.

14:07.309 --> 14:08.853
We should stay together.

14:09.854 --> 14:12.023
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

14:12.106 --> 14:14.651
There are bigger issues to take care of...

14:14.734 --> 14:16.361
It's your turn.

14:16.444 --> 14:18.070
Dad's sending me away.

14:18.154 --> 14:21.198
He's sending you because
you're a little baby.

14:22.700 --> 14:23.993
Play the game.

14:28.456 --> 14:30.625
Turn your light off.

14:30.708 --> 14:33.210
Now turn it on and you'll feel better.

14:36.464 --> 14:39.091
What kind of face is that?

14:40.259 --> 14:43.513
Your face is like a monkey's butt.

14:59.487 --> 15:01.989
Come on! Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

15:04.116 --> 15:06.411
Hurry! I see one! Hurry!

15:06.494 --> 15:07.954
<i>Citizens of the republic,
living in the buffer zone.</i>

15:08.037 --> 15:09.038
Hurry!

15:09.121 --> 15:12.875
<i>The National Reformation Council

begin as planned.</i>

15:17.964 --> 15:19.173
Wait. Help me.

15:19.256 --> 15:20.341
Is it heavy? Give it to me.

15:20.425 --> 15:21.426
Agu, take it.

15:22.677 --> 15:24.178
Please, move. Move!

15:24.261 --> 15:25.387
Move back. Go back.

15:25.472 --> 15:26.723
No space. No space.

15:26.806 --> 15:30.392
Please, please, I am the Section Chief.
This is my family. There must be space.

15:30.477 --> 15:31.478
No space.

15:31.561 --> 15:33.020
This one woman
and this small-small children.

15:33.104 --> 15:34.731

15:34.814 --> 15:37.399
Where are you thinking
this woman and child would be fitted?

15:37.484 --> 15:39.151
They're gonna be
sitting in the front with you.

15:39.235 --> 15:41.571
No, no, no, no, no.
Seventy thousand, no boy.

15:42.238 --> 15:43.239
With the boy.

15:43.322 --> 15:45.450
You wanting your woman to
walk through the bush to the capital?

15:45.533 --> 15:47.702
I'd rather walk. I can't leave my child.

15:47.785 --> 15:48.786
You can't walk!

15:48.870 --> 15:50.037
Please, how much to fit the boy?

15:50.121 --> 15:51.497
Seventy thousand, no boy.

15:51.498 --> 15:52.499

- Driver! Driver, driver!

15:52.582 --> 15:54.667
Please, please, please.
Hey, hey. With the boy!

15:54.751 --> 15:57.253
No boy. No bargaining.

15:57.837 --> 15:59.338
I can't.

15:59.964 --> 16:01.173
Get in!

16:01.257 --> 16:02.550

You're with the men now, keep quiet.

Go take the clothes out of the rain.

17:39.146 --> 17:41.398
Agu, close the windows.

17:50.867 --> 17:55.204
<i>God, when I'm closing my eyes,</i>

17:55.287 --> 17:58.833
<i>I am seeing
the rainy season in my village.</i>

17:58.916 --> 18:03.838
<i>You can be finding the ground
is washing away beneath your feet.</i>

18:03.921 --> 18:09.510
<i>Nothing is ever for sure...
and everything is always changing.</i>

18:31.741 --> 18:33.159
Agu! Agu!

18:45.838 --> 18:47.131
Hey.

18:52.094 --> 18:54.138
Come on! Hurry!

18:54.221 --> 18:56.348
Stay here. I'll call you when it's clear.

19:08.027 --> 19:10.107
Hey! Hey, hey!

19:46.816 --> 19:48.567
Keep quiet. They'll hear us.

19:53.865 --> 19:56.868
If we run away now,
they won't see us.

19:57.534 --> 20:00.496
Be patient. The soldiers are outside.

20:00.579 --> 20:02.999
If you talk, they'll find us. Keep quiet.

20:24.896 --> 20:25.897
Agu...

20:25.980 --> 20:27.523
whatever happens...

20:27.606 --> 20:29.108
it's God testing us.

20:29.191 --> 20:31.861
We have to be strong.

20:42.413 --> 20:44.373
We have to go.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.085
Open it.

20:48.169 --> 20:49.586
Don't do it!

20:59.847 --> 21:00.848
Please.

21:04.685 --> 21:06.728
Turn around! Turn around!

21:06.813 --> 21:08.689
Give me a rope!

21:08.773 --> 21:10.607
I will kill you today.

Which faction do you fight for?

21:19.283 --> 21:20.117
No faction.

21:20.118 --> 21:21.368
- No faction.
- We are not fighters.

21:21.452 --> 21:23.830
We are from this town.

21:23.913 --> 21:25.915
We are protecting the stores.

21:25.998 --> 21:27.373
You are Native Defense Forces, hmm?

21:27.374 --> 21:28.375
- You are Native Defense Forces, hmm?
- No.

21:28.459 --> 21:31.212
I am the Section Chief.
We are trying to stop the looters.

21:31.295 --> 21:32.922
Bring the woman.

21:33.005 --> 21:34.339
You are calling us looters.

21:34.340 --> 21:36.700
- You are calling us looters.
- No. No. No, no, no.

21:40.137 --> 21:41.848
You fuckin' shit. Quiet!

21:41.931 --> 21:43.640

21:46.560 --> 21:48.687
- Do you know these men?
- Master, master, master, please. Please.

21:48.770 --> 21:50.815
This woman, everybody knows she's crazy.

21:50.898 --> 21:51.899
I don't know them.

21:51.983 --> 21:54.693
Master! Master, talk to her and you know
that she's not right in the head.

21:54.776 --> 21:56.653
They are not from here.
They must be rebels.

21:56.737 --> 21:58.030
We are not rebels.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.370
We, the armed forces of
the National Reformation Council,

22:04.453 --> 22:05.454
find you all to be spies.

22:05.537 --> 22:06.538
- No!
- Please!

22:06.622 --> 22:10.126
I sentence you to
immediate and summary execution.

22:10.209 --> 22:11.878
Waste them.

22:11.961 --> 22:13.129

22:13.212 --> 22:14.796

<i>Cease fire!</i>

27:31.280 --> 27:32.613
Wanna die, fucking PLF?

27:32.614 --> 27:34.254
- Wanna die, fucking PLF?
- Fucking rebel.

27:34.950 --> 27:36.535
Tie this fucking spongebag up.

27:38.078 --> 27:40.372
Hurry! Hurry!

27:40.456 --> 27:41.664
I'm gonna kill you, man!

27:41.665 --> 27:43.905
- I'm gonna kill you, man!
- This is not the right place.

27:44.042 --> 27:45.085
Take position.

27:45.168 --> 27:46.378
CO Hope, take your man.

27:46.462 --> 27:48.003
I'm gonna kill you.

27:48.004 --> 27:49.404
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Fucking PLF!

27:49.882 --> 27:51.174
Strip those PLF soldiers!

27:51.258 --> 27:52.259
Strip them.

27:52.343 --> 27:53.969
Move, move!

28:03.229 --> 28:04.688
Hey, you! Keep your eyes down.

28:04.771 --> 28:07.774
Don't look at me.

28:07.858 --> 28:11.528
Everybody move!
Here comes the Commandant.

28:13.780 --> 28:16.074
You get out of the fucking way!

28:21.788 --> 28:24.333
What is this thing doing here?

28:26.335 --> 28:29.338
Who is responsible
for bringing this thing?

28:34.343 --> 28:37.346
Strika, is it you
that is bringing this thing?

28:39.723 --> 28:43.227
Strika, untie him.

28:44.811 --> 28:46.230
So all of you grown men,

28:46.313 --> 28:50.317
it is Strika, the small boy,
that is finding this prisoner.

28:51.943 --> 28:53.237
Where is Two-I-C?

28:53.320 --> 28:54.529
Two-I-C!

28:54.530 --> 28:55.656
- Two-I-C!
- Two-I-C!

28:55.739 --> 28:56.782
Two-I-C!

28:58.367 --> 28:59.868
Commandant, sir!

28:59.951 --> 29:03.664
Two-I-C, what are we
to be doing with this thing?

29:04.456 --> 29:07.376
This thing?
It is just a boy.

29:08.126 --> 29:09.753
A boy?

29:12.256 --> 29:14.215
A boy is nothing.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.134
A boy is harmless?

29:16.217 --> 29:17.428
Harmless, no, sir!

29:17.511 --> 29:19.012
Does a boy have two eyes to see?

29:19.095 --> 29:20.514
Two eyes, sir!

29:20.597 --> 29:23.517
A boy has hands to strangle
and fingers to pull triggers.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.686
Why you saying a boy is nothing? Huh?

29:25.769 --> 29:29.022
A boy is very, very dangerous.
You understand me?

29:30.190 --> 29:32.275
Very dangerous, you understand?

29:32.276 --> 29:33.193
- Very dangerous, you understand?
- Yes, sir!

29:33.277 --> 29:34.194
Huh?

29:34.195 --> 29:35.236
- Huh?
- Yes, sir!

29:35.321 --> 29:38.782
Strika, are you hungry?

29:38.865 --> 29:41.993
Are you wanting to be eating this thing?

29:46.873 --> 29:48.709
Let me see your hands.

29:52.921 --> 29:55.799
Oh, you have hands like a baby.

30:03.724 --> 30:05.559
What are you doing here?

30:09.187 --> 30:10.689
You should be telling me.

30:10.772 --> 30:12.566
If you are telling me,
I will be helping you.

30:12.649 --> 30:15.486
You see, Strika is hungry.
He will eat you.

30:15.569 --> 30:16.737
Huh?

30:16.820 --> 30:18.780
What are you doing here?

30:25.329 --> 30:30.667
The government army killed my father...
and my big brother...

30:31.835 --> 30:36.757
and my father told me to run...
into the bush.

30:43.263 --> 30:45.306
Everybody here is
calling me Commandant.

30:45.391 --> 30:46.724
How does the Commandant look?

30:46.725 --> 30:47.809
- How does the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

30:47.893 --> 30:49.059
How does the Commandant look?

30:49.060 --> 30:49.895
- How does the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

30:49.978 --> 30:51.688
Ah.

30:51.772 --> 30:54.149
Now, what are they calling you?

30:54.983 --> 30:55.984
Agu.

30:56.067 --> 30:58.278
Oh, you must say it
like you are prouder!

30:58.362 --> 30:59.905
Agu.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.407
One more time.

31:01.490 --> 31:02.323
Agu.

31:02.323 --> 31:03.199
- Agu.
- Uh-huh.

31:03.283 --> 31:05.452
Well, Agu,

31:05.536 --> 31:08.414
that is what I will be
calling you then, eh?

31:15.837 --> 31:21.092
Leave this one under my charge.
I will be training him to be a warrior.

31:21.176 --> 31:23.804
So you can be fighting
the army that is killing your father.

31:23.887 --> 31:27.724
Is that what you want?
You must be saying yes!

31:27.808 --> 31:29.100
Formation!

31:29.184 --> 31:30.060
Say yes!

31:30.060 --> 31:30.894
- Say yes!
- Yes.

31:30.977 --> 31:32.061
"Yes, sir!"

31:32.062 --> 31:32.896
- "Yes, sir!"
- Yes, sir!

31:32.979 --> 31:34.855
"Yes, sir!"

31:34.856 --> 31:35.899
- "Yes, sir!"
- Yes, sir!

31:35.982 --> 31:36.817
"Yes, sir!"

31:36.817 --> 31:37.651
- "Yes, sir!"
- Yes, sir!

31:37.734 --> 31:39.277
- "Yes, sir!"
- Yes, sir!

31:39.360 --> 31:40.403
One more time.

31:40.404 --> 31:41.279
- One more time.
- Yes, sir!

31:41.362 --> 31:42.238
One more time. Mmm-hmm.

31:42.239 --> 31:43.364
- One more time. Mmm-hmm.
- Yes, sir!

31:43.449 --> 31:44.450
Yes, sir!

31:47.536 --> 31:48.787
- Again.
- Yes, sir!

31:48.870 --> 31:51.623
Rambo, give this SBU some work.

31:52.791 --> 31:54.250
You must carry this one.

31:54.334 --> 31:58.338
I saved your life. I saved your life.

31:58.422 --> 32:00.340
I saved your life. Go!

33:57.290 --> 33:58.917
- Yes, Commandant, sir!
- Yes, sir!

33:59.000 --> 34:01.127
- Commandant, sir!

34:16.266 --> 34:17.853

34:27.571 --> 34:29.656
But you must be initiated.

34:29.739 --> 34:30.574
Am I clear?

34:30.574 --> 34:31.407
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

34:31.491 --> 34:32.618
They are not understanding me, boys.

34:32.701 --> 34:34.034
Show them what I'm talking about.

34:34.119 --> 34:35.494
Raise... Put up your fucking hands!

34:35.495 --> 34:38.495
- Raise... Put up your fucking hands!
- Check them. Check them. Make sure...

34:45.130 --> 34:46.505
Bring me the small boy.

34:46.590 --> 34:47.716
This way.

34:49.009 --> 34:51.011
CO Hope!

34:55.181 --> 34:56.600
Yes, sir.

34:56.683 --> 35:00.896
This baby boy is your responsibility now.
Train him.

35:00.979 --> 35:04.608
Yes, sir! Come over.

35:04.691 --> 35:08.654
Come over! Fucking move!
Let's move. Move. Move.

35:43.563 --> 35:44.648
Move.

35:47.150 --> 35:48.608
Please, can I have some of the food?

35:48.609 --> 35:50.969
Please, can I have some of the food?

35:51.154 --> 35:53.281
You think you are soldier now, eh?

35:53.364 --> 35:56.492
You's nothing.
You're not doing nothing here.

35:57.243 --> 36:00.121
I carry ammunition all day.

36:00.205 --> 36:03.750
You! Hey! Hey! Move!

36:03.834 --> 36:04.793
What? What I do?

36:04.794 --> 36:06.354
- What? What I do?
- Wake up!

36:07.963 --> 36:09.756
You go back and
stand on top of the chair.

36:09.840 --> 36:10.841
Do it!

36:10.924 --> 36:13.176
I said go and stand
on top of the chair!

36:13.259 --> 36:16.262
Yeah. And salute!

36:17.848 --> 36:20.809
Two-I-C, go and call Strika to my house.

36:20.892 --> 36:24.020
CO Hope!
Send Strika to Commandant!

36:25.814 --> 36:27.190
Strika, go.

36:29.860 --> 36:32.028
Where you go get
this thing from?

36:32.112 --> 36:34.948
Two-I-C tell me
to train this boy.

36:47.418 --> 36:50.756
Show me position! Make sure you are clear.
Move them, now!

36:50.839 --> 36:51.840
Yes, sir!

36:51.923 --> 36:53.925
First group, move!

36:57.428 --> 36:59.973
You stay together! You stay together!

37:00.056 --> 37:02.517
Close the space.
You're too far.

37:03.309 --> 37:06.437
Where are you looking at?
Where are you looking? Eh?

37:06.521 --> 37:07.898
Look at your enemy.

37:07.981 --> 37:09.524
Change!

37:09.607 --> 37:14.404
<i>God... I want to be
seeing my mother again.</i>

37:14.487 --> 37:19.492
<i>Two-I-C is saying,
small-small we are winning this war.</i>

37:19.575 --> 37:24.164
<i>And then if you are willing,
I can be finding her again.</i>

37:25.456 --> 37:27.959
<i>But, only you know.</i>

37:31.046 --> 37:34.715
The National Reformation Council
took advantage of this instability

37:34.800 --> 37:39.012
and militarily seized power
to restore UPC dominance.

37:39.095 --> 37:43.016
We NDF refuse to recognize
this illegitimate government.

37:43.099 --> 37:44.224
Who are we?

37:44.225 --> 37:45.351
- Who are we?
- We are NDF.

37:45.435 --> 37:46.685
I said who are we?

37:46.686 --> 37:48.104
- I said who are we?
- We are NDF!

37:48.188 --> 37:51.524
<i>Our very own politicians,
who steal our resources</i>

37:51.607 --> 37:55.570
<i>and give them away for small-small dollar
in exchange for private pay-offs,</i>

37:55.653 --> 37:57.697
they are spit on the constitution!

37:57.781 --> 37:59.866
They are spit on your rights!

37:59.950 --> 38:02.202
They are trying to spit on your future!

38:02.285 --> 38:03.995
I say, who is your Supreme Commandant?

38:04.079 --> 38:05.288
Dada Goodblood!

38:05.371 --> 38:06.289
I say, who do you fight for?

38:06.290 --> 38:08.410
- I say, who do you fight for?
- Dada Goodblood!

38:09.125 --> 38:11.669
<i>In the battlefield,
you not be thinking normally.</i>

38:11.752 --> 38:12.587
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

38:12.587 --> 38:13.421
<i>- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir!</i>

38:13.504 --> 38:17.258
<i>The only thing mattering
is the mission of the NDF!</i>

38:17.342 --> 38:18.176
Am I clear?

38:18.177 --> 38:19.219
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

38:19.302 --> 38:20.761
- Soldiers, are you hearing me?
- Yes, sir!

38:20.846 --> 38:23.723
You fight and kill anyone
who destroys the peace.

38:23.807 --> 38:24.808
Yes, sir!

38:53.169 --> 38:56.882
Offside, offside! That's what I saw.
Offside, offside! Offside!

39:02.345 --> 39:03.721
Hey, stop it!

39:05.098 --> 39:06.432
All right, stop it!

39:13.064 --> 39:14.774
Native Defense Forces!

39:16.317 --> 39:18.027
How does your Commandant look?

39:18.028 --> 39:19.195
- How does your Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

39:19.279 --> 39:20.654
How does your Commandant look?

39:20.655 --> 39:22.949
- How does your Commandant look?
- All right, sir!

39:24.075 --> 39:30.373
What is it that has brought
this big family of strangers together?

39:31.624 --> 39:32.832
Was it fear?

39:32.833 --> 39:34.044
- Was it fear?
- No, sir!

39:34.127 --> 39:35.086
Was it war?

39:35.086 --> 39:35.962
- Was it war?
- Yes, sir!

39:36.046 --> 39:38.965
We were defending ourselves.

39:39.049 --> 39:42.177
We have to get revenge. Huh?

39:42.260 --> 39:43.636
We have been defending ourselves

39:43.719 --> 39:47.515
against the killings and rapings
of our own people from the PLF

39:47.598 --> 39:50.185
and now from the NRC junta.

39:51.102 --> 39:54.730
But it has awakened a sleeping beast.

39:54.814 --> 39:57.150
It has awakened a giant.

39:57.233 --> 40:00.445
It has put the weapons of this war
back in the hands of you,

40:00.528 --> 40:04.615
the young and, therefore, the powerful.

40:05.783 --> 40:08.619
Young men! Wealth?

40:08.703 --> 40:12.748
We will not wait
to inherit any wealth. Huh?

40:12.832 --> 40:14.918
We will not wait for them
to come and give it to us.

40:15.001 --> 40:16.294
No, sir!

40:16.377 --> 40:18.753
We are going to take it.

40:18.754 --> 40:20.465
- We are going to take it.
- Yes, sir!

40:20.548 --> 40:21.840
We're going to take it from them.

40:21.841 --> 40:23.093
- We're going to take it from them.
- Yes, sir!

40:23.176 --> 40:24.052
Seize it!

40:24.053 --> 40:25.173
- Seize it!
- Yes, sir!

40:25.220 --> 40:28.932
All of you that have
never been listened to before

40:29.015 --> 40:32.143
and have seen your family killed, huh,

40:32.227 --> 40:36.231
you now have something
that stands for you.

40:36.314 --> 40:38.483
You now have something
that stands for you!

40:39.734 --> 40:41.151
That is your defense.

40:41.152 --> 40:42.912
That is your defense.

40:43.488 --> 40:45.280
That is your family's blood.

40:45.281 --> 40:46.782
- That is your family's blood.
- Yes, sir!

40:46.866 --> 40:47.700
Victory!

40:47.700 --> 40:48.618
- Victory!
- Victory!

40:48.701 --> 40:49.577
Victory!

40:49.577 --> 40:50.577
- Victory!
- Victory!

40:50.620 --> 40:51.620
We are going to seize it!

40:51.621 --> 40:52.497
- We are going to seize it!
- Victory!

40:52.580 --> 40:53.414
Victory!

40:53.415 --> 40:54.749
- Victory!
- Victory!

40:59.712 --> 41:01.839
You are my family.

42:46.319 --> 42:48.738
You must die...

42:48.821 --> 42:50.448
before you are reborn.

43:27.318 --> 43:29.862
The spirits have blessed you...

43:30.446 --> 43:33.449
and cleansed you.

43:33.533 --> 43:36.244
To the enemy, you are invincible.

43:37.995 --> 43:42.167
But there are rules we must follow...

43:42.250 --> 43:44.294
to keep the spirits happy...

43:47.046 --> 43:49.215
to remain pure.

44:06.106 --> 44:08.693
Enemy never see you again!

44:08.776 --> 44:12.155
You are fortified!
You are fortified, eh?

44:13.614 --> 44:14.699
<i>Hey!</i>

44:18.077 --> 44:19.995
Our enjoyment is over.

44:20.079 --> 44:22.373
Now it is time for war.
We are warring.

44:23.082 --> 44:25.585
We did enjoy our camp...

44:26.377 --> 44:29.589
but from here we are moving.

44:29.672 --> 44:33.968
Moving forward.
We are not to stay here.

44:35.094 --> 44:38.348
Don't be leaving anything
for the enemy to be using.

44:38.431 --> 44:40.641
We are going to burn it down.

44:42.893 --> 44:43.935
Am I clear?

44:43.936 --> 44:45.813
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

44:45.896 --> 44:46.856
You are dismissed.

44:46.856 --> 44:47.773
- You are dismissed.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

44:47.857 --> 44:49.316
COs dismissed!

44:49.317 --> 44:50.192
- COs dismissed!
- Thank you, sir.

44:50.276 --> 44:52.987
All of you, pack your weapons.
Be ready to move.

44:53.070 --> 44:54.864
Moving out in one hour!

44:56.115 --> 44:58.200
Ah-ha!
Make sure this thing is burned.

44:58.284 --> 44:59.369
- The whole place!
- Yes, sir!

44:59.452 --> 45:01.537
Don't make me be
waiting for you, soldiers!

45:01.621 --> 45:03.301
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

45:08.711 --> 45:10.296
Got all of it?

45:10.380 --> 45:12.715
We are leaving nothing for them to find.

45:25.478 --> 45:26.771
Burn it down!

45:26.854 --> 45:28.188
All of it!

45:48.709 --> 45:50.961
<i>Iron Jacket.
This is Supremo.</i>

45:51.045 --> 45:53.130
<i>You are loud, Supremo.</i>

45:53.213 --> 45:54.590
<i>Report.</i>

45:54.674 --> 45:56.926
<i>We are supplied
and moving. Over.</i>

45:57.009 --> 45:58.969
Make sure all the guns are clean.

45:59.053 --> 46:00.388
<i>Strike at your first opportunity.</i>

46:00.471 --> 46:01.806
They have been
buried for a long time.

46:01.889 --> 46:02.890
Make sure they work.

46:02.973 --> 46:04.934
<i>Seize supplies.
Map victories.</i>

46:05.017 --> 46:07.728
<i>This will keep the spirit up,
despite the UN embargo.</i>

46:07.812 --> 46:10.105
<i>Roger. Well copied, sir.</i>

46:10.189 --> 46:12.525
<i>Our fight is a just one.</i>

46:12.608 --> 46:16.278
<i>Being a freedom fighter is discipline,
obedience and loyalty.</i>

46:16.362 --> 46:17.363
<i>Roger.</i>

46:17.447 --> 46:20.741
<i>We remain ever loyal to Supreme HQ, sir.</i>

46:20.825 --> 46:23.369
<i>Standing by for future orders. Over.</i>

46:23.453 --> 46:27.039
<i>Keep moving. Keep fighting.
Over and out.</i>

46:28.333 --> 46:30.460
This here.
This is the route where we are now.

46:30.543 --> 46:32.920
Listen. From here, we must go down.

46:33.003 --> 46:34.254
And wait by that road there.

46:34.339 --> 46:35.881
Because I think something
is coming across there.

46:35.965 --> 46:37.132
Yes, sir.

46:51.731 --> 46:53.566
Move. Move!

46:59.196 --> 47:01.281
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Agu! Agu!

47:01.366 --> 47:03.368
Come. Come.

47:04.994 --> 47:05.995
Hey!

47:07.747 --> 47:12.460
Hey! Why? Where do you go?
Come over! Fuck! Fly!

47:37.109 --> 47:38.629
Preacher, give me the ganja.

47:40.320 --> 47:43.408
Hey, hey.

47:57.588 --> 48:00.299
Agu, you know,
ambush rule number one, no noise.

48:00.382 --> 48:03.469
You keep quiet.
Keep very quiet.

48:03.553 --> 48:06.013
If even a snake bite your legs,
you keep quiet.

48:06.096 --> 48:07.389
You get hit, you keep quiet.

48:07.473 --> 48:10.059
What is the rule number one in ambush?

48:10.142 --> 48:12.186
No talking,
even if snake is biting you.

48:12.269 --> 48:14.021
Okay.

48:14.104 --> 48:17.357
You talk, enemies come around,
we all go die.

48:18.317 --> 48:19.485
Right.

48:22.988 --> 48:24.949
Psst! Psst! Enemies.

48:29.745 --> 48:33.332
They are coming.
Everybody, be quiet. They are coming.

49:22.339 --> 49:23.591
Get ready.

49:25.843 --> 49:27.386
Go, go, go.

49:32.432 --> 49:33.768
RPG! RPG!

49:48.032 --> 49:50.535
Agu! Ammo!

49:51.451 --> 49:53.078
Ammo!

49:53.704 --> 49:55.790
Hey, you! Go!
Cut them off!

49:56.666 --> 49:57.958
Where's the fucking ammo?

50:02.004 --> 50:03.505
...fire!

50:03.589 --> 50:05.550
Cease fire!

50:05.633 --> 50:07.384
Cease fire!

50:08.594 --> 50:11.764
Agu! My ammo box!

50:11.847 --> 50:13.558
You want me to die?

50:24.694 --> 50:27.071
Search this vehicle.
Search all the vehicles.

50:27.154 --> 50:27.988
Yes, sir!

50:27.989 --> 50:29.589
- Yes, sir!
- I want them disarmed.

50:29.615 --> 50:31.617
I want them disrobed.

50:31.701 --> 50:35.788
I want this victory mapped.
Map them. Map this victory.

50:35.871 --> 50:36.996
Controller, map them!

50:36.997 --> 50:38.874
- Controller, map them!
- Yes, sir!

50:38.958 --> 50:42.169
This vehicle, all the bodies,
I want them pockets searched.

50:43.462 --> 50:47.507
All of it! Search them good-good.

50:54.306 --> 50:55.140
Pack it up.

50:55.140 --> 50:55.975
- Pack it up.
- Sir.

50:56.058 --> 50:57.309
Ah-ha!

50:57.392 --> 50:59.061
Go and bring me my charge.

50:59.144 --> 51:00.187
Agu!

51:00.270 --> 51:01.437
Sir! I find this.

51:01.438 --> 51:02.481
- Sir! I find this.
- Why don't you open it?

51:02.564 --> 51:03.983
I find this.

51:04.066 --> 51:05.275
Oh!

51:06.151 --> 51:07.444
Uh-huh.

51:10.865 --> 51:11.907
Yes.

51:11.991 --> 51:13.075
Agu!

51:16.578 --> 51:17.705
Where is he?

51:17.788 --> 51:18.873
Agu!

51:20.834 --> 51:22.594
Go shut your fucking mouth.

51:26.421 --> 51:27.715
Yes, sir!

51:29.884 --> 51:31.343
Agu, you are going to kill this man.

51:31.426 --> 51:34.429
Please.
I'm supposed to be fixing the bridges.

51:34.513 --> 51:35.793
You are going to kill him today.

51:35.848 --> 51:37.391
I not be a soldier.
Please, sir.

51:37.933 --> 51:41.812
I'm an engineering student
from the university in the capital.

51:41.896 --> 51:43.313
I'm supposed to be
fixing the bridges,

51:43.397 --> 51:46.191
- not be a...
- Shut up!

51:46.275 --> 51:47.359
Shut your mouth.

51:47.442 --> 51:50.362
Pass me something for this guy.

51:51.906 --> 51:53.407
- Nah, that's too big.
- It will be cutlass.

51:53.490 --> 51:54.825
Yeah, I see.

51:54.909 --> 51:55.910
Does he have strength for this?

51:55.993 --> 51:59.830
Yeah, he is strong. You can do it.
Preacher, put him on his ass.

52:01.666 --> 52:04.001
Put him on his ass! On his ass!

52:04.084 --> 52:05.377
Agu, come.

52:05.460 --> 52:10.132
So when you are chopping wood,
lift up high-high. Up, high.

52:10.215 --> 52:11.341
Uh-huh!

52:11.425 --> 52:17.639
Then when you are ready,
you come down so well-well into the flesh.

52:17.723 --> 52:18.890
You have chopped melon before? Melon?

52:18.891 --> 52:19.809
- You have chopped melon before? Melon?
- Please, no.

52:19.892 --> 52:20.726
Well, this is not a melon.

52:20.726 --> 52:21.560
- Well, this is not a melon.
- Please, no.

52:21.643 --> 52:25.147
I said shut your mouth, huh?
Shut your mouth.

52:26.440 --> 52:29.568
You are making it hard.
This is hard.

52:29.651 --> 52:32.404
It's hard,
so you must split him good.

52:33.530 --> 52:37.451
Huh? Agu, these are the ones
that killed your father.

52:38.035 --> 52:39.078
Huh?

52:39.161 --> 52:39.995
Go on.

52:39.995 --> 52:40.995
Go on.

52:43.123 --> 52:44.207
Shut up!

52:44.208 --> 52:45.808
- Shut up!
- Please. Please.

52:46.626 --> 52:48.003
Agu, go on.

52:49.671 --> 52:50.798
Agu!

52:52.257 --> 52:54.051
Please, no.

52:54.134 --> 52:55.344
Chop him good-good.

52:55.427 --> 52:57.512
Please!

52:58.055 --> 53:01.516
These are the ones,
the dogs that kill your father.

53:01.600 --> 53:03.185
Where is your mother?

53:03.268 --> 53:04.644
Please...

53:04.729 --> 53:07.606
Agu, these are the ones
that killed your father!

53:08.690 --> 53:10.400
Chop that head!

53:12.277 --> 53:13.570
Chop him!

53:19.785 --> 53:21.411
Agu, come on!

53:22.788 --> 53:23.956
Ahh!

53:29.336 --> 53:31.296
Strika, help your brotha.

54:10.544 --> 54:12.337
Good.

54:14.173 --> 54:15.340
That's right.

54:15.424 --> 54:16.466
Watch his blood.

54:16.550 --> 54:19.178
That is what you call justice. Hmm.

54:19.261 --> 54:22.932
<i>God... I have killed a man.</i>

54:25.184 --> 54:27.812
<i>It is the worst sin...</i>

54:27.895 --> 54:30.147
<i>but I am knowing too,</i>

54:30.230 --> 54:32.858
<i>it is the right thing to be doing.</i>

54:32.942 --> 54:33.775
Tripod!

54:33.775 --> 54:34.609
- Tripod!
- Yes, sir.

54:34.693 --> 54:36.486
This will be the Commandant's car.

54:36.570 --> 54:39.531
Take this fucker out.
He is filthy.

54:39.614 --> 54:42.326
Two-I-C! Two-I-C!

54:44.203 --> 54:46.455
Give this to my charge. Huh?

54:48.082 --> 54:49.958
This will be the Commandant's car.

54:49.959 --> 54:51.418
- This will be the Commandant's car.
- Yes, sir.

54:51.501 --> 54:54.338
If you are losing it,
then I am losing you.

54:56.048 --> 54:57.132
Hmm!

54:59.093 --> 55:00.094
Uh-huh.

55:00.845 --> 55:02.096
This...

55:03.347 --> 55:04.639
- You are driving?
- Okay to move out.

55:04.723 --> 55:07.101
Everyone, get ready to move out.

55:07.184 --> 55:09.019
Get ready to move out, Agu.

55:41.760 --> 55:43.553
You got this stuff from where?

55:46.473 --> 55:47.975
From dead bodies?

55:55.649 --> 55:59.444
Everybody is calling you "Strika." Why?

56:05.617 --> 56:07.077
Are you liking war?

56:09.579 --> 56:12.166
Hey, I'm asking you a question,
and you are not talking.

56:15.044 --> 56:16.795
Are you having family?

56:27.472 --> 56:30.017
I am thinking about my mom...

56:33.395 --> 56:34.854
my brother...

56:37.399 --> 56:39.859
and my little sister.

56:58.503 --> 56:59.921
Are you stupid?

57:03.258 --> 57:05.177
Why are you not talking?

57:05.260 --> 57:06.980
I am asking a question.
You are not talking.

57:40.087 --> 57:42.006
Go! Go! Fast!

57:55.060 --> 57:56.478
Go! Go, go!

57:59.189 --> 58:02.317
I got you, Strika.

58:34.433 --> 58:35.350
Where is he?

58:35.350 --> 58:36.185
- Where is he?
- Keep going, keep going.

58:36.268 --> 58:39.271
Grass cutter! Grass cutter!
Grass cutter!

58:39.354 --> 58:40.480
Left, left, left.

59:19.936 --> 59:23.148
And you're having
any food that you want,

59:23.232 --> 59:26.776
from chicken, cow,
fruit and vegetable...

59:26.860 --> 59:31.448
Any kind of fish that you want, we got.
The fisherman is bringing it from the sea.

59:31.531 --> 59:33.617
There's nothing you cannot have there.

59:33.700 --> 59:39.873
And the best thing of this place,
this town of abundant resources,

59:39.956 --> 59:42.376
is the women.

59:42.459 --> 59:47.422
Hey, the women are too beautiful there!
Too beautiful.

59:47.506 --> 59:50.925
Ah! The next thing you know, your soldier
will be standing to attention.

59:54.053 --> 59:57.807
They are having bottoms
with specifications so nice

59:57.891 --> 01:00:02.354
that the ground where they're sitting down
is also rejoicing.

01:00:02.437 --> 01:00:07.151
And they know...
they know how to be treating a man.

01:00:07.234 --> 01:00:11.363
How to make him feel good,
kisses and all that, huh?

01:00:11.446 --> 01:00:14.366
Last time I was there,
my soldier was hurting.

01:00:14.449 --> 01:00:15.450
I couldn't stand up, eh!

01:00:17.702 --> 01:00:22.249
But you will see
because you are going there yourselves.

01:00:22.332 --> 01:00:23.333
Hmm?

01:00:23.417 --> 01:00:25.960
You will see with
your own eyes, gentlemen.

01:00:26.044 --> 01:00:27.629
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:31.049 --> 01:00:32.217
Commandant, sir!

01:00:35.512 --> 01:00:36.595
Who is this?

01:00:36.596 --> 01:00:38.765
- Who is this?
- Refugees from the village, sir.

01:00:38.848 --> 01:00:42.477
They said the PLF and the NRC
took their village three days ago.

01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:44.896
They killed most of the town,
but they let these ones go.

01:00:44.979 --> 01:00:46.231
Hmm.

01:00:50.277 --> 01:00:53.280
Well, let us be giving
their village back, huh?

01:00:53.363 --> 01:00:54.656
Yes, sir.

01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:05.417
Look at that.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.794
They are cutting people's hands.

01:01:09.087 --> 01:01:10.672
Fucking PLF.

01:01:37.699 --> 01:01:38.741
Radio!

01:01:38.742 --> 01:01:40.022
- Radio!
- Yes, sir.

01:01:44.414 --> 01:01:46.039
Two-I-C!

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.501
- Two-I-C!
- <i>Roger, you are loud.</i>

01:01:47.584 --> 01:01:48.835
Report!

01:01:48.918 --> 01:01:52.005
<i>Uh, we are facing heavy fire, sir. Over.</i>

01:01:52.088 --> 01:01:53.298
Can you take the bridge?

01:01:53.382 --> 01:01:55.717
It's very difficult, sir.
Men are fighting bravely,

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.177
but I don't know if we can
hold too much longer. Over.

01:01:58.262 --> 01:01:59.303
<i>Press on!</i>

01:01:59.304 --> 01:02:00.847
<i>- Press on!</i>
- Roger. We need support, sir.

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:02.474
Some of our men are injured.

01:02:02.557 --> 01:02:06.436
<i>The men's spirits are low.
Sir, do you copy?</i>

01:02:06.895 --> 01:02:07.729
Sir?

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:09.814
- Sir?
- <i>Can you take the bridge?</i>

01:02:09.898 --> 01:02:14.236
Copy, sir. We will reapply pressure
and push for the bridge. Over.

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:15.612
<i>Take the bridge!</i>

01:02:15.695 --> 01:02:17.280
That is your task! Mortar.

01:02:17.281 --> 01:02:18.114
- That is your task! Mortar.
- Yes, sir!

01:02:18.197 --> 01:02:19.657
Your ammo now!

01:02:19.658 --> 01:02:21.826
- Your ammo now!
- Ammunition ready, sir!

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:23.245
Stand by!

01:02:33.588 --> 01:02:35.340
Agu and Strika.

01:02:35.424 --> 01:02:36.591
Yes, sir!

01:02:36.675 --> 01:02:42.013
See this thing, huh?
This is a very special device.

01:02:42.096 --> 01:02:47.269
We can be seeing the enemy
even when the enemy is hiding.

01:02:47.352 --> 01:02:49.521
Come.

01:02:49.604 --> 01:02:51.398
Wait, Strika.

01:02:54.484 --> 01:02:59.489
Ah! There you go. See our guys.
Look, we are taking them.

01:03:01.325 --> 01:03:03.117
You see?

01:03:06.162 --> 01:03:07.289
Fire!

01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:17.716
See that?

01:03:17.716 --> 01:03:18.633
- See that?
- Yeah.

01:03:18.717 --> 01:03:21.260
That is magic. Huh?

01:03:24.097 --> 01:03:26.140
We want to take that bridge.

01:03:27.016 --> 01:03:29.478
Now we are going to
take that bridge.

01:03:33.315 --> 01:03:34.773
Formation!

01:03:34.774 --> 01:03:35.984
- Formation!
- Formation!

01:03:36.067 --> 01:03:37.777
That bridge, we are taking it!

01:03:37.861 --> 01:03:38.862
Yes, sir.

01:03:41.448 --> 01:03:44.659
Better look me in the eyes,
motherfucker.

01:03:44.743 --> 01:03:47.329
Who wants to fight?
Uh-huh.

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.624
I'm only taking the brave!

01:03:50.707 --> 01:03:53.042
I'm not taking the scared.

01:03:54.461 --> 01:03:58.382
I'm not taking no girls.

01:03:58.465 --> 01:03:59.673
Are you ready to fight?

01:03:59.674 --> 01:04:00.509
- Are you ready to fight?
- Yes, sir!

01:04:00.592 --> 01:04:01.468
Are you ready to fight?

01:04:01.469 --> 01:04:03.302
- Are you ready to fight?
- Yes, sir!

01:04:03.387 --> 01:04:04.512
You want to take that bridge?

01:04:04.513 --> 01:04:05.764
- You want to take that bridge?
- Yes, sir!

01:04:05.847 --> 01:04:07.097
We're gonna take that fucking bridge?

01:04:07.098 --> 01:04:09.338
- We're gonna take that fucking bridge?
- Yes, sir!

01:05:16.668 --> 01:05:17.669
Fucking PLF!

01:05:18.252 --> 01:05:20.547
Fucking PLF!

01:05:21.214 --> 01:05:22.255
No retreat!

01:05:22.256 --> 01:05:23.633
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

01:05:23.717 --> 01:05:24.593
No retreat!

01:05:24.594 --> 01:05:25.714
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.637
We're moving!

01:05:27.721 --> 01:05:29.222
We're moving!

01:05:29.305 --> 01:05:31.475
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

01:05:31.558 --> 01:05:33.643
We're moving!

01:05:42.026 --> 01:05:43.110
No retreat!

01:05:43.111 --> 01:05:45.671
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

01:06:17.145 --> 01:06:18.705
- Move it!
- Move it!

01:06:27.864 --> 01:06:29.699
Move it! Move it!

01:06:39.543 --> 01:06:41.586
Move it!

01:07:19.749 --> 01:07:23.127
Our Father,
from dust we were created.

01:07:23.211 --> 01:07:24.879
We shall go back to dust.

01:07:24.963 --> 01:07:26.673
Eleven of my men. Gone.

01:07:26.756 --> 01:07:29.759
I commit my fellow soldiers
into your hands.

01:07:29.843 --> 01:07:32.887
May their soul rest in peace. Amen.

01:07:34.889 --> 01:07:38.602
<i>I am now knowing
the smell of the dead.</i>

01:07:38.685 --> 01:07:40.604
<i>They are sweet like sugarcane</i>

01:07:41.563 --> 01:07:44.733
<i>and rotten like palm wine.</i>

01:07:44.816 --> 01:07:50.905
<i>And when they stay in the sun, they are
growing plump like brown mangoes.</i>

01:08:05.587 --> 01:08:06.713
Very true, sir.

01:08:06.796 --> 01:08:07.797
Strika.

01:08:18.933 --> 01:08:20.475
What?

01:08:20.559 --> 01:08:22.937
<i>You have your next mission. Stand by.</i>

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.856
You are loud, Supremo.

01:08:24.939 --> 01:08:27.734
<i>Capture the central regions,
capital city, Bov.</i>

01:08:27.817 --> 01:08:28.859
<i>When you accomplish that,</i>

01:08:28.943 --> 01:08:32.029
<i>I will promulgate an order
making you Brigadier General.</i>

01:08:32.113 --> 01:08:35.323
<i>You'll be a general before
we finally seize the capital city.</i>

01:08:35.408 --> 01:08:37.243
Yes, sir.
It is a challenge, sir.

01:08:37.326 --> 01:08:40.747
But I promise you,
it's mission possible. Over.

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:42.550
<i>Well, then, next time I see you,</i>

01:08:42.581 --> 01:08:44.167
<i>I'll be speaking to a general.</i>

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:47.127
<i>And how is your Two-I-C performing? Over.</i>

01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:50.048
Two-I-C? Sorry, sir.
What do you mean "Two-I-C"?

01:08:50.131 --> 01:08:51.800
<i>I've always rated
that young man.</i>

01:08:51.883 --> 01:08:54.761
Well, Two-I-C is
a formidable soldier.

01:08:54.844 --> 01:08:56.136
Over.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.430
<i>Teach him
the ways of a good commander.</i>

01:08:58.514 --> 01:08:59.557
Yes, sir.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.685
<i>Now, take Bov.
Keep that spirit up,</i>

01:09:01.768 --> 01:09:03.435
<i>and bring us closer to victory.</i>

01:09:03.519 --> 01:09:05.689
Of course, Supremo. Over.

01:09:05.772 --> 01:09:08.942
<i>You want to be a general,
don't you, Commandant?</i>

01:09:09.024 --> 01:09:10.108
Yes, sir.

01:09:10.109 --> 01:09:11.609
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Earn it. Over and out.</i>

01:09:11.694 --> 01:09:13.321
Over and out.

01:09:14.988 --> 01:09:17.073
Agu, you fought well today.

01:09:17.075 --> 01:09:18.915
- Agu, you fought well today.
- Thank you, sir.

01:09:19.493 --> 01:09:22.412
A-ha! What is this?

01:09:23.872 --> 01:09:25.041
Ah!

01:09:26.584 --> 01:09:28.336
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.843
Agu, you are wanting to
be knowing how to be leading?

01:09:34.926 --> 01:09:37.385
I am happy to be following you, sir.

01:09:37.386 --> 01:09:38.386
- I am happy to be following you, sir.
- That is good,

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:43.225
because there is no learning
how to be leading.

01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:46.770
Some people are born to be leaders,
others are born to be followers,

01:09:46.854 --> 01:09:49.733
and others are just waiting to be dying.

01:09:49.816 --> 01:09:51.524
I'm a good follower, sir.

01:09:51.524 --> 01:09:53.069
- I'm a good follower, sir.
- Agu, you are different.

01:09:53.152 --> 01:09:55.905
You are reminding me of
when I was a small boy.

01:09:55.989 --> 01:09:59.743
That is how I know
you are going to be a leader.

01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:02.829
You see, even the best leader

01:10:02.912 --> 01:10:07.083
sometimes he must be knowing
how to be a follower.

01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:10.128
Ah, even me.

01:10:10.211 --> 01:10:16.425
I am following the Supreme Commandant,
even if I am not agreeing.

01:10:17.761 --> 01:10:18.887
Huh?

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:22.098
Yes, sir.
I'm a good follower.

01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:26.394
You are seeing this place?

01:10:27.103 --> 01:10:30.523
The Commandant is saying
we must take this.

01:10:30.606 --> 01:10:31.733
That it is important.

01:10:31.816 --> 01:10:36.070
So, hmm, if it is important to him,
it is important to me.

01:10:36.154 --> 01:10:37.446
Yes, sir.

01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:42.118
Because if we get that,
then we can go to Taro.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.253
That is where your mother is, eh?

01:10:53.254 --> 01:10:55.614
- That is where your mother is, eh?
- She is in the capital.

01:10:56.925 --> 01:10:59.677
Come, Agu.

01:10:59.761 --> 01:11:02.263
After we've been greeted
by Dada Goodblood,

01:11:02.346 --> 01:11:05.016
we'll be taking the capital certainly.

01:11:09.312 --> 01:11:11.439
Come.

01:11:17.779 --> 01:11:20.406
This one has special juju.

01:11:20.489 --> 01:11:21.699
Thank you, sir.

01:11:21.783 --> 01:11:25.286
You see, I've been wanting to help you
more than the others, Agu,

01:11:25.369 --> 01:11:29.582
but you cannot be telling the others
how I'm helping you like this.

01:11:29.665 --> 01:11:31.750
It'll have to be our secret.

01:11:32.585 --> 01:11:34.169
You are knowing how to keep secret?

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.004
- You are knowing how to keep secret?
- Yes, sir.

01:11:35.088 --> 01:11:36.713
Well, be saying it.

01:11:36.714 --> 01:11:39.092
- Well, be saying it.
- I can be keeping this secret, sir.

01:11:50.353 --> 01:11:53.898
I'm not punishing you, Agu.
Mmm?

01:11:54.941 --> 01:11:57.151
But I do care for you.

01:12:16.087 --> 01:12:17.255
Aye.

01:12:19.715 --> 01:12:21.300
Agu, kneel down.

01:12:29.017 --> 01:12:34.105
Be doing this thing... for me.

01:13:27.701 --> 01:13:30.141
They are jumping like rabbits.

01:13:31.412 --> 01:13:33.998
Move, move to your left.

01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:40.588
- Go, go. Keep going.
- Go. Keep going.

01:13:40.671 --> 01:13:42.048
- Keep going.
- Move, move.

01:13:42.131 --> 01:13:44.217
To your left side.

01:13:48.346 --> 01:13:49.430
Agu.

01:13:51.474 --> 01:13:53.184
Agu?

01:13:53.267 --> 01:13:56.770
I don't want that I call you
and you just stand there. Agu?

01:13:58.897 --> 01:14:00.316
Come here,
I'll give you some brown-brown.

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:03.361
It'll cure everything for you, eh.

01:14:03.945 --> 01:14:06.780
Hey, I didn't call you to stand there.

01:14:09.951 --> 01:14:11.035
Hmm?

01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:16.665
My boy, what is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:20.211
Come here,
I'll give you some morale booster.

01:14:20.294 --> 01:14:23.672
I think I'll give you
that brown-brown, so...

01:14:23.756 --> 01:14:27.801
Morale booster, you know.
Come, come. Here.

01:14:30.763 --> 01:14:32.473
Yeah, that my boy.

01:14:32.556 --> 01:14:35.309
Yeah. Morale booster, eh?

01:14:35.393 --> 01:14:37.520
Make you strong.

01:14:37.603 --> 01:14:39.397
More protection.

01:14:41.315 --> 01:14:44.443
<i>Nobody is your friend
where we are going.</i>

01:14:45.486 --> 01:14:47.655
<i>They are the enemy.</i>

01:14:47.738 --> 01:14:51.409
<i>They are the farmers
that have fed the enemy.</i>

01:14:51.492 --> 01:14:53.286
- <i>The farmers' wives whose breasts...</i>
- Agu. Agu.

01:14:53.369 --> 01:14:54.828
<i>...have been feeding babies.</i>

01:14:54.912 --> 01:14:56.664
<i>Agu.</i>

01:14:56.747 --> 01:15:00.126
That is the nature
of the land that we are going.

01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:03.504
The collaborators and the traitors.

01:15:04.338 --> 01:15:06.840
<i>Our people's blood
has been flowing for years.</i>

01:15:06.924 --> 01:15:10.344
<i>That's why it is time
for their blood to flow.</i>

01:15:10.428 --> 01:15:13.681
<i>We will spare nobody.</i>

01:15:13.764 --> 01:15:15.891
We'll spare nobody,

01:15:15.974 --> 01:15:19.645
because they are all enemy,
all of them!

01:15:21.689 --> 01:15:22.773
Let us pray.

01:15:25.484 --> 01:15:27.528
God, let us pray.

01:15:29.072 --> 01:15:32.658
<i>He is guiding us with
what we are about to be doing.</i>

01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:34.243
<i>He is helping us.</i>

01:15:35.953 --> 01:15:38.081
<i>Let us fulfill your justice.</i>

01:15:40.624 --> 01:15:42.418
<i>Give us the strength!</i>

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:47.506
<i>God, we will be sacrificing our blood!</i>

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:50.676
<i>That is why we must spare nobody!</i>

01:15:50.759 --> 01:15:53.554
<i>We will spare nobody!</i>

01:15:53.637 --> 01:15:55.139
<i>Nothing will hurt us.</i>

01:15:58.976 --> 01:16:03.064
<i>Because we are invincible.
We are invincible!</i>

01:16:10.904 --> 01:16:13.949
NDF! NDF!

01:16:14.032 --> 01:16:15.409
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

01:16:15.493 --> 01:16:16.744
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

01:16:16.827 --> 01:16:17.661
Who are we?

01:16:17.662 --> 01:16:18.862
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

01:16:42.645 --> 01:16:44.980
NDF, spare nobody!

01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:46.814
Kill them all!

01:16:46.815 --> 01:16:48.255
Kill them all!

01:16:56.867 --> 01:16:59.287
Come on, move, NDF!
Move, move! Move!

01:17:21.267 --> 01:17:22.143
<i>How the Commandant look?</i>

01:17:22.143 --> 01:17:23.101
<i>- How the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!</i>

01:17:23.186 --> 01:17:24.061
<i>I say, how the Commandant look?</i>

01:17:24.061 --> 01:17:25.020
<i>- I say, how the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!</i>

01:17:25.103 --> 01:17:26.522
<i>- How the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!</i>

01:17:26.605 --> 01:17:27.440
<i>I say, how the Commandant look?</i>

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.274
<i>- I say, how the Commandant look?
- All right, sir!</i>

01:17:28.357 --> 01:17:29.192
<i>NDF! NDF!</i>

01:17:29.193 --> 01:17:31.319
<i>NDF! NDF!</i>

01:17:31.402 --> 01:17:32.820
<i>- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!</i>

01:17:32.903 --> 01:17:34.112
<i>- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!</i>

01:17:34.197 --> 01:17:35.323
<i>- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!</i>

01:17:35.406 --> 01:17:37.074
<i>- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!</i>

01:17:44.248 --> 01:17:45.249
<i>Agu!</i>

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:48.294
Shoot them! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

01:17:54.217 --> 01:17:56.385
Commandant! Sir!

01:17:56.469 --> 01:17:58.346
Leave this one under my charge.

01:17:58.429 --> 01:18:00.348
I will be training him to be a warrior.

01:18:00.431 --> 01:18:01.932
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

01:18:02.015 --> 01:18:03.100
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

01:18:03.184 --> 01:18:04.393
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

01:18:04.477 --> 01:18:05.853
- Yes, sir!
- Again!

01:18:05.936 --> 01:18:06.937
- Yes, sir!
- Again!

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.271
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

01:18:08.272 --> 01:18:09.273
- Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
- Again!

01:18:09.357 --> 01:18:10.524
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

01:18:10.608 --> 01:18:11.734
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

01:18:11.817 --> 01:18:13.068
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

01:18:13.151 --> 01:18:14.528
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

01:18:14.612 --> 01:18:15.571
Again!

01:18:15.571 --> 01:18:16.571
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:37.009
Move, move!
Move, move, move! Move!

01:18:37.092 --> 01:18:38.219
Fuck!

01:19:00.408 --> 01:19:03.200
Fuck you! Fucker! Fucker!

01:19:03.201 --> 01:19:05.329
Fuck you! Fucker! Fucker!

01:19:05.413 --> 01:19:06.247
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:19:06.248 --> 01:19:08.040
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:19:18.426 --> 01:19:20.010
Out, out. Over here.

01:19:20.093 --> 01:19:21.762
Fucking out! Fucking out! Out!

01:19:21.845 --> 01:19:27.059
Fucking out! Out! Get up!
Get up, fuck! Get up! Up!

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:33.566
Ma... Ma!

01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:34.775
I'm not your mother!

01:19:35.734 --> 01:19:36.944
I'm not your mother!

01:19:37.027 --> 01:19:38.321
I found you!

01:19:38.987 --> 01:19:41.449
What the fuck going on here?

01:19:41.532 --> 01:19:43.200
You know her?

01:19:43.284 --> 01:19:44.952
I was looking for you!

01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:48.372
Where do you
know this woman from? You know her?

01:19:48.456 --> 01:19:49.665
I was looking for you!

01:19:49.748 --> 01:19:51.875
I wanna rape her.

01:19:53.043 --> 01:19:54.843
I wanna rape her!

01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:58.799
You're not my mother!

01:19:58.882 --> 01:20:00.968
Witch woman!

01:20:01.051 --> 01:20:03.095
You're not my mother! You fooled me!

01:20:03.178 --> 01:20:04.513
Witch woman!

01:20:38.339 --> 01:20:42.551
<i>God...
are you watching what we are doing?</i>

01:20:45.846 --> 01:20:48.056
Oh! Why? Shit!

01:20:50.559 --> 01:20:52.395
What the fuck is that?

01:20:53.354 --> 01:20:57.149
You didn't fucking boy, eh?
You didn't fucking, boy.

01:21:28.389 --> 01:21:31.684
You here for die, motherfucker.

01:21:33.644 --> 01:21:38.524
Fuck him up, eh?
Fuck you up. Fuck you up.

01:21:46.364 --> 01:21:48.951
Commandant, sir.
This is for you, sir.

01:21:56.792 --> 01:22:00.003
From the Supreme Commander.
What does it say?

01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:12.057
Now it is your turn to eat.

01:22:16.144 --> 01:22:17.813
Load the vehicles.

01:22:19.565 --> 01:22:21.567
He is summoning us.

01:22:25.571 --> 01:22:27.405
Did he state a reason?

01:22:28.574 --> 01:22:30.117
Isn't it clear?

01:22:34.121 --> 01:22:35.038
Are we going to Taro?

01:22:35.039 --> 01:22:36.479
Are we going to Taro?

01:22:36.999 --> 01:22:39.251
This guy!

01:22:39.334 --> 01:22:41.169
You can't see my ears?

01:22:44.465 --> 01:22:46.216
What is happening to this one?

01:22:46.299 --> 01:22:48.844
A piece of RPG
is hitting his temple.

01:22:48.927 --> 01:22:50.596
I beg you, please, don't shoot me!
Please!

01:22:50.679 --> 01:22:52.138
Hey, keep your eyes down!

01:22:52.139 --> 01:22:53.015
- Hey, keep your eyes down!
- Oi! Oi! Oi!

01:22:53.098 --> 01:22:55.017
What do we do
with the civilians?

01:22:56.018 --> 01:22:57.060
Leave one of them alive.

01:22:57.144 --> 01:23:00.814
Send him up north to the next village
and then the next village after that.

01:23:00.898 --> 01:23:03.734
Tell them that we are coming.
It's only the beginning.

01:23:03.817 --> 01:23:04.818
Get on board, everybody.

01:23:04.902 --> 01:23:06.069
- Tripod!
- Yes, sir.

01:23:06.153 --> 01:23:10.908
Take note and act accordingly.
Strika and Agu are now part of my squad.

01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:12.785
Mountain View. Iron Jacket. Over.

01:23:12.868 --> 01:23:14.495
Get in there now! Move!

01:23:14.578 --> 01:23:16.997
We are proceeding to Taro
with arms. Over!

01:23:19.833 --> 01:23:20.668
Get in!

01:23:20.669 --> 01:23:22.335
- Get in!
<i>- Okay. Roger.</i>

01:23:22.419 --> 01:23:24.797
Echo, tango, alpha, 1800 hours.

01:23:39.562 --> 01:23:40.687
Tripod!

01:23:40.688 --> 01:23:41.522
- Tripod!
- Yes, sir!

01:23:41.605 --> 01:23:43.273
Guns up!

01:24:02.084 --> 01:24:04.211
Halt! Halt!

01:24:05.045 --> 01:24:06.254
- Enemy or friend?
- Friend!

01:24:06.338 --> 01:24:07.840
- Who are you?
- NDF!

01:24:15.263 --> 01:24:16.974
Who is your commander?

01:24:17.057 --> 01:24:18.851
I am.

01:24:18.934 --> 01:24:21.812
What kind of welcome is this?

01:24:21.895 --> 01:24:24.857
Sorry, sir. You, get in that car.
Take them to HQ.

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.984
Clear the way!

01:24:27.067 --> 01:24:28.401
Clear the fuckin' way!

01:24:32.489 --> 01:24:34.867
Right this way.
Right this way.

01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:39.663
Fuck you!

01:24:52.259 --> 01:24:56.054
Victory! Victory! Victory!

01:25:28.671 --> 01:25:30.672
Commandant, welcome.

01:25:30.673 --> 01:25:31.715
- Commandant, welcome.
- Hello, Deputy.

01:25:31.799 --> 01:25:33.634
Follow us.

01:25:33.717 --> 01:25:37.179
Weapons are not allowed in here.
So you place them here.

01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:39.264
Leave your weapons, boys.
Soldiers.

01:25:46.021 --> 01:25:48.982
You wait here.
Here. Have a seat.

01:25:49.066 --> 01:25:50.275
And you will bring us water?

01:25:51.068 --> 01:25:52.402
Certainly.

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:09.502
Goodblood will see you now.

01:26:10.253 --> 01:26:11.254
Him.

01:26:36.113 --> 01:26:38.156
Have a seat here.

01:26:52.838 --> 01:26:55.173
Goodblood says
this is a token of appreciation...

01:26:55.257 --> 01:26:57.592
Yo! What are you doing?

01:26:58.886 --> 01:27:04.099
I'm sorry. The Supreme Commander
is so very upset to keep you waiting.

01:27:04.182 --> 01:27:06.309
Please, will you follow me?

01:27:10.272 --> 01:27:11.648
Please sit.

01:27:16.361 --> 01:27:17.737
What is this?

01:27:17.738 --> 01:27:18.947
- What is this?
- He'll be with you shortly.

01:27:19.031 --> 01:27:21.116
Huh? Where is the water?

01:27:21.199 --> 01:27:23.243
Bring them water, quickly!

01:28:03.616 --> 01:28:04.993
Commandant.

01:28:07.704 --> 01:28:08.746
Commandant?

01:28:10.665 --> 01:28:11.959
Commandant.

01:28:14.502 --> 01:28:15.963
<i>I trust you rested well.</i>

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.925
I would like you to know
we also offered rations and water

01:28:20.008 --> 01:28:22.970
to the rest of your battalion
this morning.

01:28:23.053 --> 01:28:24.721
Thank you, Deputy.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:35.148
Please, gentlemen.
Please come over.

01:28:38.235 --> 01:28:39.652
Stand there.

01:28:49.704 --> 01:28:50.705
Attention!

01:29:07.555 --> 01:29:09.557
Commandant.

01:29:09.641 --> 01:29:11.559
Supreme Commander, sir.

01:29:14.562 --> 01:29:15.856
At ease, gentlemen.

01:29:15.939 --> 01:29:17.774
At ease.

01:29:27.575 --> 01:29:29.995
It looks like your family has grown.

01:29:30.078 --> 01:29:33.916
They must eat while we talk,
unless you are hungry, too.

01:29:33.999 --> 01:29:37.585
I'm not hungry. Two-I-C,
take them and go and eat.

01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:40.380
Two-I-C, you stay.

01:29:40.463 --> 01:29:41.589
Come.

01:29:46.303 --> 01:29:49.597
Lot of food over here.
Let's eat, man!

01:29:50.598 --> 01:29:52.184
I love food.

01:29:59.316 --> 01:30:00.775
What is this?

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.363
You have made me wait.

01:30:06.614 --> 01:30:10.452
You are leading me to believe
we are changing objectives.

01:30:10.535 --> 01:30:13.413
Are we not taking the capital anymore?

01:30:13.496 --> 01:30:17.625
Chief, to protect our people,
the time is now.

01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:22.880
If we have the momentum
and we have the power, why wait?

01:30:22.965 --> 01:30:28.345
You are not the political voice
of this movement, Commandant. I am.

01:30:28.428 --> 01:30:32.765
Protecting our people
remains the priority.

01:30:32.849 --> 01:30:36.894
But as you know, the world is
becoming aware of this war now.

01:30:37.812 --> 01:30:40.815
No one will escape judgment
when it is over.

01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:45.778
And the decisions we make
have far deeper consequences.

01:30:45.862 --> 01:30:50.492
And what decisions have you made...
for my battalion?

01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:55.622
Are you not making me general?

01:30:55.705 --> 01:30:57.749
No, I am not.

01:30:57.832 --> 01:31:01.294
I'm giving your battalion
to Two-I-C, Commandant.

01:31:01.378 --> 01:31:02.712
That is why I brought you here.

01:31:02.795 --> 01:31:07.717
And you, I will promote
to Deputy Chief of Security,

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:08.801
effective immediately.

01:31:08.885 --> 01:31:12.639
I hope you accept and act accordingly.

01:31:14.182 --> 01:31:16.476
Thank you, sir. I promise
to fulfill my duty to the fullest...

01:31:16.559 --> 01:31:18.079
Two-I-C, shut your mouth!

01:31:19.479 --> 01:31:21.023
Get out!

01:31:24.484 --> 01:31:25.652
Soldiers.

01:31:33.701 --> 01:31:36.454
You are demoting me.

01:31:37.705 --> 01:31:42.335
This, my battalion...
that I have made with my own hands.

01:31:42.419 --> 01:31:44.003
I'm their father!

01:31:44.087 --> 01:31:47.340
Your battalion is my battalion,
Commandant,

01:31:47.424 --> 01:31:49.967
as are hundreds of others
across this nation.

01:31:50.885 --> 01:31:53.305
I want the ceremony of changeover
tomorrow,

01:31:53.388 --> 01:31:56.349
so that Two-I-C can take the battalion
back out for battle.

01:31:56.433 --> 01:32:00.520
As you know, and with thanks to you,
we have the NRC on their heels

01:32:00.603 --> 01:32:03.731
with the help and support
of the UN and ECOMOD.

01:32:03.815 --> 01:32:07.026
It has now become
a battle for public image.

01:32:08.736 --> 01:32:11.156
And what of my payment? Hmm?

01:32:11.239 --> 01:32:12.574
What of my payment?

01:32:12.657 --> 01:32:17.495
What share of the resources
will I be seeing?

01:32:18.037 --> 01:32:20.957
Do not forget you are a soldier.

01:32:21.541 --> 01:32:24.086
Your most important duty is obedience.

01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:25.628
Your first duty is obedience.

01:32:25.712 --> 01:32:27.505
Your second duty is obedience.

01:32:27.589 --> 01:32:30.300
Your third duty is obedience.
Everything is obedience.

01:32:30.383 --> 01:32:34.512
Without obedience, you have nothing.

01:32:36.639 --> 01:32:39.101
Have you forgotten yourself?

01:32:41.644 --> 01:32:43.896
I have not forgotten myself.

01:32:45.773 --> 01:32:47.984
You are right.

01:32:48.067 --> 01:32:51.488
I'm a soldier...

01:32:51.571 --> 01:32:54.116
not a politician.

01:32:56.493 --> 01:33:01.206
I will have one more night...
with my men.

01:33:05.293 --> 01:33:06.961
Dada Goodblood.

01:33:09.881 --> 01:33:10.881
Move out!

01:33:10.882 --> 01:33:11.799
- Move out!
- Move!

01:33:11.883 --> 01:33:12.717
Move out!

01:33:12.718 --> 01:33:13.926
- Move out!
- Move out!

01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:15.595
Let's go.

01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:23.644
Tripod.

01:33:23.645 --> 01:33:24.562
- Tripod.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:24.646 --> 01:33:28.024
Assemble the COs and the troops
and bivouac outside of town.

01:33:28.107 --> 01:33:31.319
I'm taking Two-I-C and the boys
to all celebrate tonight.

01:33:31.403 --> 01:33:32.529
Yes, sir.

01:33:32.612 --> 01:33:34.322
Where are we going?

01:33:36.366 --> 01:33:38.410
You will see.

01:33:38.493 --> 01:33:40.328
You will like it.

01:33:40.412 --> 01:33:44.374
And if you and Strika are my bodyguards,
and I am going, then you are also going.

01:33:44.457 --> 01:33:46.334
Are you hearing me?

01:34:08.273 --> 01:34:10.900
<i>Imagination TV.</i>

01:34:10.983 --> 01:34:12.694
Ha! So you come!

01:34:12.777 --> 01:34:17.573
Ha! Commandant! Commandant!

01:34:17.574 --> 01:34:18.533
- Ha! Commandant! Commandant!
- Ah, Mama.

01:34:18.616 --> 01:34:20.618
Welcome, welcome.

01:34:20.702 --> 01:34:23.062
Yeah, make 'em bring
something for my soldiers.

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.622
- Okay.
- And my own soldier.

01:34:24.706 --> 01:34:25.707
Hey, hey...

01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:29.211
Bring beer. Bring soda.
Bring whatever you have.

01:34:29.294 --> 01:34:31.338
Hey, hey! Get up!

01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:33.673
Hurry, hurry!

01:34:33.756 --> 01:34:37.469
Can't you see we have guests? Hurry!

01:34:42.181 --> 01:34:43.933
The beer is warm.

01:34:44.934 --> 01:34:46.436
How is the beer warm?

01:34:46.519 --> 01:34:47.978
No ice.

01:34:47.979 --> 01:34:48.980
- No ice.
- No ice?

01:34:49.063 --> 01:34:51.524
No light.

01:34:51.608 --> 01:34:53.360
But I am seeing light.

01:34:53.443 --> 01:34:54.902
No ice.

01:34:54.986 --> 01:34:58.240
Oh! Well, doesn't matter

01:34:58.323 --> 01:35:00.783
because we will drink it
whether it's hot or it's cold.

01:35:00.867 --> 01:35:03.077
Go on. Share it.

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.204
Commandant, permission to be dismissed.

01:35:05.288 --> 01:35:06.956
I need to be checking on the others...

01:35:07.039 --> 01:35:08.708
Negative!

01:35:10.877 --> 01:35:14.171
You will be staying here
so we can celebrate you.

01:35:14.256 --> 01:35:19.010
In fact, Mama, I want you to bring
a special one for my Two-I-C,

01:35:19.093 --> 01:35:22.264
who will soon be the Commandant.

01:35:22.347 --> 01:35:23.680
Who is your Commandant?

01:35:23.681 --> 01:35:24.516
- Who is your Commandant?
- You, sir!

01:35:24.599 --> 01:35:27.560
Hmm.
But you have one special for Two-I-C.

01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:29.812
No problem.

01:35:29.896 --> 01:35:32.524
No problem.

01:35:34.901 --> 01:35:36.611
No problem.

01:35:36.694 --> 01:35:39.572
Hey, Mama, this one has fresh papaya.

01:35:39.656 --> 01:35:41.198
No, no, no, no, Commandant.

01:35:41.283 --> 01:35:42.825
Leave this one now.

01:35:42.909 --> 01:35:46.746
If it is women you wanting,
I get plenty from backyard.

01:35:46.829 --> 01:35:49.999
Just bring me my own.
You know my specifications.

01:35:50.082 --> 01:35:51.250
I know! I know!

01:35:51.334 --> 01:35:53.252
Aunty, bring us some chips.

01:35:53.336 --> 01:35:54.712
Ah.

01:35:54.796 --> 01:35:57.340
See this little yeah-yeah boy
born yesterday.

01:35:57.424 --> 01:36:00.468
Don't mind him. Don't mind him.

01:36:00.552 --> 01:36:01.802
Where are the girls?

01:36:01.803 --> 01:36:03.723
- Where are the girls?
- They are coming.

01:36:04.722 --> 01:36:09.894
We've got enough girls for the men,
but no more for the little boys.

01:36:12.397 --> 01:36:14.816
Leave your weapons with Strika.

01:36:21.656 --> 01:36:23.408
Oh-ho!

01:36:24.867 --> 01:36:27.244
You're the controller.

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:30.707
How are you? How are you?

01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:33.000
Look at you.
Look at you.

01:36:33.084 --> 01:36:35.252
Commandant. Commandant.

01:36:35.337 --> 01:36:38.213
You are looking very hot.

01:36:38.214 --> 01:36:39.341
- You are looking very hot.
- Yeah, I miss you.

01:36:39.424 --> 01:36:40.383
Oh, you miss me. Really?

01:36:40.383 --> 01:36:41.258
- Oh, you miss me. Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:36:41.343 --> 01:36:43.511
Strika.

01:36:43.595 --> 01:36:45.805
SBU, be watching guard.

01:36:45.888 --> 01:36:50.393
Don't be watching your Commandant
because you can't have what I'm having.

01:37:08.536 --> 01:37:09.856
<i>We'll start shooting.</i>

01:37:10.246 --> 01:37:12.289
<i>Go stand by the waterfall.</i>

01:38:09.305 --> 01:38:11.433
What happened? Huh?

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:14.101
What happened?

01:38:16.228 --> 01:38:17.229
You did this.

01:38:17.313 --> 01:38:19.732
What happened to my man?
What happened here?

01:38:19.816 --> 01:38:21.818
I was just playing with his gun
and it just went off.

01:38:21.901 --> 01:38:23.444
I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.

01:38:23.445 --> 01:38:24.904
- I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.
- You did this.

01:38:24.987 --> 01:38:27.740
- You did this.
- Relax, relax, relax, relax!

01:38:27.824 --> 01:38:29.366
You did this! You did this!

01:38:29.451 --> 01:38:31.327
I didn't mean to.

01:38:31.410 --> 01:38:32.620
- You thought you were shooting me!
- No, no, no!

01:38:32.704 --> 01:38:33.870
You thought it was me?

01:38:33.871 --> 01:38:34.872
- You thought it was me?
- I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

01:38:34.956 --> 01:38:36.541
Were you trying to kill me
and you kill my soldier?

01:38:36.624 --> 01:38:39.586
It was an accident!
No! Not me...

01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:40.795
Go!

01:38:43.339 --> 01:38:45.382
- Let's go. Let's go! Hey!
- Move!

01:38:45.467 --> 01:38:47.844
Pick him up! Pick him up!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:38:47.927 --> 01:38:49.807
Pick him up!
I want you to take all their women!

01:38:49.846 --> 01:38:51.138
- Move! Move! Move! Move!
- All of them!

01:38:51.222 --> 01:38:52.056
Move!

01:38:52.057 --> 01:38:54.217
- Move!
- Let's go! Let's go! Move!

01:38:57.979 --> 01:39:00.022
<i>All call signs, all call signs,</i>

01:39:00.106 --> 01:39:01.858
<i>anyone have eyes on Iron Jacket?</i>

01:39:01.941 --> 01:39:05.737
<i>All call signs report visual

01:39:06.863 --> 01:39:10.157
<i>Mountain View, Z Fire.

<i>All call signs,

01:39:15.371 --> 01:39:19.083
<i>Any knowledge on the location
or movement of Iron Jacket? Over.</i>

<i>Green Snake. No visual.</i>

01:39:23.379 --> 01:39:26.132
<i>I repeat, no visual of Iron Jacket.
Over.</i>

01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:31.387
<i>Mountain View. Two-two.
Copy same. No visual on Iron Jacket.</i>

01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:33.430
<i>Nothing to report. Over.</i>

<i>Mountain View.
Black Sand.</i>

01:39:36.559 --> 01:39:41.272
<i>Report, Iron Jacket moved out
from our checkpoint yesterday. Over.</i>

01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:45.151
<i>Black Sand. Mountain View.</i>

01:39:45.234 --> 01:39:47.361
<i>Iron Jacket moved through
your sector? Over.</i>

<i>Mountain View, Black Sand, Roger.</i>

01:39:55.494 --> 01:39:59.331
<i>Iron Jacket battalion moved out
with orders for battle. Over.</i>

01:39:59.415 --> 01:40:01.751
This...

01:40:04.003 --> 01:40:07.173
This was all for nothing.

01:40:18.059 --> 01:40:20.311
<i>Iron Jacket,
this is Mountain View.</i>

01:40:20.394 --> 01:40:21.813
Agu, is that you?

01:40:21.896 --> 01:40:23.355
- <i>Iron Jacket, where are you?</i>
- Yes, sir.

01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:25.316
- <i>Do you read me? Over.</i>
- Come.

01:40:25.399 --> 01:40:28.611
- Come and sit with me.
<i>- Iron Jacket, do you copy? Over.</i>

01:40:28.695 --> 01:40:31.113
<i>Iron Jacket, you are disobeying a direct...</i>

01:40:41.123 --> 01:40:44.627
Agu, these are very dangerous times.

01:40:45.544 --> 01:40:48.130
Never know who you could be trusting.

01:40:48.214 --> 01:40:49.298
Huh?

01:40:50.341 --> 01:40:54.721
That is why it is good
to always sleep one eye open.

01:40:55.805 --> 01:40:58.600
That is why I have you and I have Strika.

01:41:03.479 --> 01:41:06.273
Agu, sometimes I'm feeling sorry for you.

01:41:08.693 --> 01:41:10.236
Sometimes I am.

01:41:14.281 --> 01:41:16.701
Two-I-C is dead.

01:41:16.784 --> 01:41:20.287
<i>God, bless the man who died</i>

01:41:20.371 --> 01:41:24.083
<i>On the great battlefront</i>

01:41:24.166 --> 01:41:28.004
<i>For the sake of the NDF</i>

01:41:28.087 --> 01:41:32.216
<i>God, bless the man who died</i>

01:41:32.299 --> 01:41:36.262
Our Father, today
we lost our fellow soldier.

01:41:36.345 --> 01:41:39.641
Guide him forever and ever. Amen.

01:41:39.724 --> 01:41:41.142
Amen.

01:41:42.309 --> 01:41:43.728
Two-I-C.

01:41:45.813 --> 01:41:46.648
Yes, sir!

01:41:46.649 --> 01:41:48.232
Yes, sir!

01:41:50.067 --> 01:41:53.112
This was not God's work.

01:41:53.195 --> 01:41:54.822
This was man.

01:41:55.406 --> 01:41:58.034
Supreme Commandant was our friend.

01:41:58.534 --> 01:42:00.995
Now he's our enemy.

01:42:01.078 --> 01:42:05.917
But we are not fearing change,
for we are strong!

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.670
Strong and proud!

01:42:09.211 --> 01:42:13.966
That is why we should be
taking our own territory...

01:42:15.551 --> 01:42:18.137
and filling our own pockets.

01:42:19.972 --> 01:42:23.726
Gentlemen, move out.

01:42:24.435 --> 01:42:26.145
Let's move.

01:42:30.983 --> 01:42:35.947
<i>We are leaving Two-I-C
to be eaten by</i> gogomi <i>and worms.</i>

01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:38.991
<i>We are leaving him.</i>

01:42:39.075 --> 01:42:41.493
<i>And I am thinking,</i>

01:42:41.577 --> 01:42:44.706
<i>"The only way not to be
fighting anymore is to be dying."</i>

01:43:38.885 --> 01:43:41.137
Medic!
Where's the fucking medic?

01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:43.264
He's fucking dead, my man!

01:43:49.311 --> 01:43:53.274
<i>People are dying
just like this every day.</i>

01:43:53.357 --> 01:43:56.735
<i>Every person I am knowing is dying.</i>

01:43:56.819 --> 01:43:58.654
<i>And I am thinking,</i>

01:43:58.737 --> 01:44:04.660
<i>"If this war is ever ending, I cannot be
going back to doing child things."</i>

01:44:13.502 --> 01:44:16.588
<i>Bullet is just eating everything.</i>

01:44:18.841 --> 01:44:22.887
<i>Leaves, trees, ground, person.</i>

01:44:24.596 --> 01:44:25.597
<i>Eating them.</i>

01:44:26.432 --> 01:44:29.393
<i>Just making person to bleed everywhere.</i>

01:44:34.816 --> 01:44:40.196
<i>We are just like wild animals now
with no place to be going.</i>

01:44:45.742 --> 01:44:47.995
<i>Sun,</i>

01:44:48.079 --> 01:44:50.414
<i>why are you
shining on this world?</i>

01:44:52.166 --> 01:44:55.627
<i>I am wanting to catch you in my hands,</i>

01:44:55.711 --> 01:45:00.091
<i>to squeeze you until
you cannot shine no more.</i>

01:45:02.176 --> 01:45:05.137
<i>That way, everything is always dark</i>

01:45:05.221 --> 01:45:07.389
<i>and nobody's ever having to see</i>

01:45:07.473 --> 01:45:10.601
<i>all the terrible things
that are happening here.</i>

01:45:54.478 --> 01:45:56.438
Preacher!

01:46:00.401 --> 01:46:01.485
Sir.

01:46:09.868 --> 01:46:11.370
Thank you, sir.

01:46:34.685 --> 01:46:36.520
Strika.

01:46:37.104 --> 01:46:39.190
Strika! Strika! Strika!

01:46:39.898 --> 01:46:42.568
Stand up and let's go!
We are going.

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.030
Let's go!

01:46:47.531 --> 01:46:49.033
Strika!

01:46:50.409 --> 01:46:52.119
Stand up and let's go!

01:46:54.788 --> 01:46:56.707
What is wrong with you?

01:47:00.711 --> 01:47:02.213
What is wrong?

01:48:03.482 --> 01:48:08.320
<i>I am wanting to say to Strika,
"I am tired, too."</i>

01:48:10.572 --> 01:48:12.616
<i>I am tired,</i>

01:48:12.699 --> 01:48:16.037
<i>and so the words are not
coming out of my mouth.</i>

01:48:47.609 --> 01:48:48.819
Strika?

01:48:51.155 --> 01:48:52.781
Do you hear that?

01:48:54.366 --> 01:48:56.702
A song, just like my mother sang.

01:49:00.081 --> 01:49:01.290
Strika?

01:49:03.250 --> 01:49:04.460
Strika?

01:49:06.753 --> 01:49:07.963
Strika.

01:49:16.638 --> 01:49:19.100
Strika! Strika!

01:49:20.892 --> 01:49:22.103
Strika!

01:49:25.063 --> 01:49:26.273
Strika!

01:49:37.075 --> 01:49:38.660
Someone help us.

01:49:42.748 --> 01:49:44.208
Strika!

01:49:45.292 --> 01:49:46.502
Strika!

01:49:49.713 --> 01:49:51.132
Strika!

01:49:53.217 --> 01:49:54.426
Strika!

01:51:02.578 --> 01:51:06.207
Fuck you. Life is sad.

01:51:24.808 --> 01:51:28.312
Agu. Agu. Agu!

01:51:28.395 --> 01:51:29.521
Sir?

01:51:29.605 --> 01:51:32.524
Go get me some fucking bullets
to be shooting right now. Move!

01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:35.026
Move!

01:51:59.426 --> 01:52:01.136
Do you have bullet?

01:52:15.401 --> 01:52:16.610
<i>Mother.</i>

01:52:20.822 --> 01:52:25.661
<i>I can only be talking to you now
because God is not listening.</i>

01:52:30.457 --> 01:52:33.502
<i>Your song is making my body to move,</i>

01:52:33.585 --> 01:52:36.755
<i>and I am not having to think anymore.</i>

01:52:42.678 --> 01:52:47.433
<i>Not about Strika, not about this war,</i>

01:52:47.516 --> 01:52:51.353
<i>not about any of the things
that are jumping into my head.</i>

01:52:56.483 --> 01:53:00.362
<i>I am wanting to lie down
on the warm ground</i>

01:53:00.446 --> 01:53:05.116
<i>with my eyes closed
and the smell of mud in my nose.</i>

01:54:04.468 --> 01:54:06.052
Commandant, sir.

01:54:07.345 --> 01:54:09.264
We are out from bullet.

01:54:14.478 --> 01:54:17.814
It wasn't supposed to be the way
that it has turned out to be.

01:54:19.065 --> 01:54:22.193
Everybody betrays you eventually.

01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:27.866
But you, I will always protect you, Agu,
because you are my son...

01:54:29.868 --> 01:54:32.704
and a son always protects a father.

01:54:37.208 --> 01:54:40.504
Commandant, I want to talk to you, sir.

01:54:40.587 --> 01:54:42.506
What is all this?

01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:43.965
We are leaving, sir.

01:54:44.049 --> 01:54:45.592
Who is leaving?

01:54:47.302 --> 01:54:50.263
Who and who is leaving?

01:54:51.973 --> 01:54:54.726
Two-I-C, go back to your post.

01:54:55.936 --> 01:54:59.648
No, sir. We are going, sir.

01:54:59.731 --> 01:55:01.900
You are the only one
standing in front of me, stupid.

01:55:02.734 --> 01:55:08.323
I am going, sir. No bullets.
What am I going to use to shoot my enemy?

01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:10.826
We have been here for months now.

01:55:10.909 --> 01:55:13.078
Gold miners, no gold.

01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:16.748
No money, no food, no water.

01:55:16.832 --> 01:55:18.459
It madness, Commandant.

01:55:19.209 --> 01:55:21.545
People sick here and dying every day.

01:55:22.963 --> 01:55:25.757
It madness, Commander.

01:55:25.841 --> 01:55:27.551
Who want to stay here and die?

01:55:27.634 --> 01:55:28.718
I want to go!

01:55:28.719 --> 01:55:30.136
- I want to go!
- I want to going!

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.055
Who want to stay here and die?

01:55:32.138 --> 01:55:33.557
I want to go, sir!

01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:35.266
Me, too. I want to go, sir!

01:55:36.059 --> 01:55:37.894
Who want to stay here and die?

01:55:37.978 --> 01:55:39.019
Nobody want to stay here, sir!

01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:41.140
- Nobody want to stay here, sir!
- We want to go, sir.

01:55:41.482 --> 01:55:43.024
Then come and tell him how you feel.

01:55:44.526 --> 01:55:48.739
Come and tell him
how much we are suffering here.

01:55:50.365 --> 01:55:53.785
Come! Everybody, come.

01:55:53.869 --> 01:55:56.580
So, you...
you are the big man now, huh?

01:55:57.748 --> 01:55:58.957
Hmm?

01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:01.209
Where will you be going? Huh?

01:56:01.292 --> 01:56:04.295
Will you surrender to the other NDF camp?

01:56:04.379 --> 01:56:07.048
No. They will eat you.

01:56:08.592 --> 01:56:11.386
And what of ECOMOD? Huh?

01:56:11.470 --> 01:56:14.180
That might be better, but what next?

01:56:14.264 --> 01:56:16.182
Jail?

01:56:16.266 --> 01:56:18.184
War crimes?

01:56:18.268 --> 01:56:19.352
Huh?

01:56:21.187 --> 01:56:26.485
You think you can just go
and do what you want in peace?

01:56:26.568 --> 01:56:29.112
You will go back to your village

01:56:29.195 --> 01:56:33.492
and your family will not
associate themselves with you.

01:56:33.575 --> 01:56:35.410
Huh? You will be nothing.

01:56:35.494 --> 01:56:39.748
You and your uneducated, poor mind,
you'll be nothing.

01:56:39.831 --> 01:56:43.334
Nobody will care for you. Huh?

01:56:43.418 --> 01:56:45.754
Look at you.

01:56:45.837 --> 01:56:52.343
And you will wake up and you will rise
and see the sunrise and see the sunset,

01:56:52.427 --> 01:56:55.889
and you can just wait all day, all day,

01:56:55.972 --> 01:57:00.602
with thousands of men just like you,
waiting for somebody to give you a job.

01:57:00.686 --> 01:57:01.728
Huh?

01:57:02.729 --> 01:57:05.023
That is what you want to go and do?

01:57:05.106 --> 01:57:08.151
You are stupid!

01:57:08.652 --> 01:57:11.655
You have nothing!
No future!

01:57:11.738 --> 01:57:12.906
I am your future.

01:57:13.448 --> 01:57:15.576
You fucking die here, sir.

01:57:15.659 --> 01:57:16.993
What?

01:57:22.207 --> 01:57:25.376
How are you going to shoot me
if you don't have bullets?

01:57:27.754 --> 01:57:30.423
And you, Agu?

01:57:30.506 --> 01:57:32.425
You wanna kill Commandant?

01:57:33.134 --> 01:57:36.221
Hey, Agu, I want you
to kill Commandant. Come.

01:57:36.304 --> 01:57:37.138
Push it.

01:57:37.138 --> 01:57:38.014
- Push it.
- Do it.

01:57:38.098 --> 01:57:40.934
Come, Agu, come.
Put it here. Here!

01:57:41.017 --> 01:57:42.227
A-ha! A-ha!

01:57:43.144 --> 01:57:44.437
Wanna kill Commandant?

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:46.439
Do it, Agu.

01:57:46.982 --> 01:57:48.441
Do it.

01:57:48.524 --> 01:57:51.111
Kill Commandant!

01:57:51.194 --> 01:57:52.988
You wanna surrender?

01:57:53.071 --> 01:57:54.239
Huh?

01:57:54.322 --> 01:57:56.282
You wanna surrender?

01:57:59.535 --> 01:58:01.121
You wanna surrender?

01:58:03.081 --> 01:58:04.165
Yes.

01:58:10.964 --> 01:58:12.257
Hey, Agu.

01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:16.970
Just get out.

01:58:19.765 --> 01:58:24.645
Just remember,
when you are all poor and hungry

01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:28.189
you'll remember me!

01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:32.068
You'll remember your Commandant.

01:58:32.568 --> 01:58:34.988
Just go! Just go!

01:58:35.071 --> 01:58:36.865
Come on. Everybody, let's move!

01:58:36.948 --> 01:58:38.700
- Yes, sir!
- Come on, let's go.

01:58:38.784 --> 01:58:43.038
And know that I will be
calling for you one day.

01:58:45.290 --> 01:58:48.960
Go and drink gunpowder tea
and playing draughts.

01:58:49.044 --> 01:58:53.131
No, no, no. You remember me.
You remember your Commandant.

01:58:53.214 --> 01:58:55.216
You're gonna say, "Yeah!"

01:58:58.845 --> 01:59:01.890
Remember, I will call for you again...

01:59:01.973 --> 01:59:04.893
and you'll come.

01:59:06.978 --> 01:59:08.271
Remember.

01:59:18.198 --> 01:59:22.577
They will just lock you up in jail!
You are stupid!

01:59:23.494 --> 01:59:25.914
When the time come back,

01:59:25.997 --> 01:59:28.333
the other ones,
they'll come eat you.

01:59:28.416 --> 01:59:31.795
Just chop for you...
your heart.

01:59:31.878 --> 01:59:34.547
Agu, you stay here because they don't...

02:00:17.758 --> 02:00:19.342
Halt! Stop there!

02:00:19.425 --> 02:00:20.634
Who are you?

02:00:20.635 --> 02:00:21.636
- Who are you?
- NDF, sir!

02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:22.721
And what is your mission here?

02:00:22.804 --> 02:00:23.844
Surrender, sir!

02:00:23.889 --> 02:00:26.808
Raise up your arms!
All weapons in the air!

02:00:26.892 --> 02:00:27.893
All of you!

02:00:29.144 --> 02:00:31.521
Now turn and face the bush!

02:00:31.604 --> 02:00:35.025
Don't look at my face!
Put your weapons on the ground!

02:00:35.108 --> 02:00:38.361
Step back.
Step back!

02:00:38.444 --> 02:00:40.488
And turn around!

02:00:40.571 --> 02:00:42.240
I said, turn around!

02:00:42.323 --> 02:00:43.658
All right, hands up!

02:00:43.742 --> 02:00:46.244
Hands up! Sit on the floor!

02:00:51.416 --> 02:00:53.251
Sit down!

02:00:54.252 --> 02:00:56.379
Put your hands on your head!

02:01:01.176 --> 02:01:03.011
Don't look at my face!

02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.097
Agu, how are you settling in?

02:03:53.014 --> 02:03:54.140
Hmm?

02:03:56.267 --> 02:03:59.104
I know things are hard.

02:03:59.729 --> 02:04:01.772
I've been there, remember?

02:04:03.441 --> 02:04:06.152
We are all here to help you.

02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:08.947
Okay?

02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:12.075
<i>I am not knowing
how long I am staying here...</i>

02:04:13.284 --> 02:04:16.537
<i>but I'm staying here for a long time.</i>

02:04:18.331 --> 02:04:23.669
<i>Some week, some month, I am not knowing.</i>

02:04:25.921 --> 02:04:29.217
<i>All I am knowing
is how it is feeling here.</i>

02:04:31.761 --> 02:04:37.017
<i>I am knowing the sound of people screaming
and the smell of dead bodies...</i>

02:04:38.476 --> 02:04:43.731
<i>and I am knowing the feeling of
the brown-brown and</i> djamba <i>in my blood.</i>

02:04:52.073 --> 02:04:53.866
Hey, calm down!

02:04:53.949 --> 02:04:55.243
This is your home!

02:04:55.326 --> 02:04:57.745
No, they are giving us poison there!

02:04:57.828 --> 02:04:59.497
- They want us to die!
- Yes!

02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:01.082
- They want us to die!
- Calm!

02:05:01.166 --> 02:05:03.793
<i>Preacher is tiring of this place.</i>

02:05:03.876 --> 02:05:05.920
<i>He's saying, "The war is not over,</i>

02:05:06.004 --> 02:05:08.714
<i>"and they are needing fighters like us."</i>

02:05:08.798 --> 02:05:11.926
We need money for here.
We need money. Eh?

02:05:12.010 --> 02:05:14.054
You can't stay here without money.

02:05:14.845 --> 02:05:17.265
And we're soldiers,

02:05:17.348 --> 02:05:19.642
fighting is what we know.

02:05:19.725 --> 02:05:21.769
That's what we should do.

02:05:21.852 --> 02:05:24.564
Have you forgotten?
We have food to eat.

02:05:24.647 --> 02:05:26.274
- We have shelter.
- Shh!

02:05:29.402 --> 02:05:32.279
And even we learn, we learn.

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.156
- And even we learn, we learn.
- Yeah.

02:05:33.239 --> 02:05:34.532
You for shut up!

02:05:34.615 --> 02:05:37.785
You NRC soldier,
with the talk, you talk too much.

02:05:39.370 --> 02:05:42.332
Agu, I can't stay here. I'm leaving.

02:05:42.415 --> 02:05:44.166
Preacher!

02:05:44.167 --> 02:05:45.167
- Preacher!
- Let's go!

02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:49.089
Randy, don't go into the bush again.

02:05:51.299 --> 02:05:52.758
Don't follow Preacher.

02:05:52.842 --> 02:05:55.178
Randy!

02:06:08.983 --> 02:06:11.902
I don't like when you look into my eyes.

02:06:11.986 --> 02:06:15.906
So if I look at a table,
how can I talk to you?

02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:17.492
<i>Amy.</i>

02:06:17.575 --> 02:06:19.619
<i>She thinks that my no speaking</i>

02:06:19.702 --> 02:06:23.414
<i>is because I can't be
explaining myself like baby,</i>

02:06:23.498 --> 02:06:25.500
<i>but I am not like baby.</i>

02:06:25.583 --> 02:06:29.712
<i>I am like old man
and she's like small girl</i>

02:06:29.795 --> 02:06:34.967
<i>because I am fighting in war
and she's not even knowing what war is.</i>

02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:37.220
Try.

02:06:37.303 --> 02:06:41.307
Try to talk to me about
some of your experiences...

02:06:42.517 --> 02:06:46.437
or try to tell me what you are thinking.

02:06:49.232 --> 02:06:51.442
I'm thinking about my future.

02:06:52.777 --> 02:06:53.861
Very good.

02:06:53.944 --> 02:06:56.114
Very good.

02:06:56.197 --> 02:06:59.159
So how do you see your future?

02:07:07.583 --> 02:07:09.502
Do me this favor, okay?

02:07:14.757 --> 02:07:19.637
I think if you talk to me about it,
it will make you feel better.

02:07:28.354 --> 02:07:30.356
I saw terrible things...

02:07:32.858 --> 02:07:35.695
and I did terrible things.

02:07:35.778 --> 02:07:38.781
So if I'm talking to you,

02:07:38.864 --> 02:07:44.204
it will make me sad...
and it will make you, too, sad.

02:07:44.287 --> 02:07:45.871
In this life...

02:07:47.748 --> 02:07:50.876
I just want to be happy in this life.

02:07:53.588 --> 02:07:56.090
If I'm telling this to you...

02:07:59.969 --> 02:08:02.305
you will think that...

02:08:07.518 --> 02:08:10.020
I am some sort of beast...

02:08:12.398 --> 02:08:14.317
or devil.

02:08:18.321 --> 02:08:20.656
I am all of these things...

02:08:23.117 --> 02:08:25.536
but I also having mother...

02:08:29.540 --> 02:08:30.916
father...

02:08:33.919 --> 02:08:36.256
brother and sister once.

02:08:38.341 --> 02:08:40.551
They loved me.

02:08:41.305 --> 02:08:47.242
