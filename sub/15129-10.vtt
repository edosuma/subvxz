WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.453
(siren wailing in distance)

00:03.487 --> 00:04.871
Charlie's initial M.R.I. showed signs

00:04.922 --> 00:06.790
of a diffuse axonal injury.

00:06.824 --> 00:10.293
His latest M.R.I. shows...
complete resolution,

00:10.327 --> 00:11.428
and all the swelling has resolved,

00:11.462 --> 00:13.296
as have all of the contusions.

00:13.330 --> 00:14.464
His brain is now slack.

00:14.498 --> 00:16.833
To tearing, no inflammation,
no sign of D.A.I.

00:16.851 --> 00:17.884
Why isn't he waking up?

00:17.935 --> 00:19.803
That is the mystery, Alex.

00:19.837 --> 00:21.321
There's something we're not seeing.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.722
And the last time you checked,

00:22.773 --> 00:23.973
did you find anything else
in his medical records?

00:24.007 --> 00:24.974
Think. Come on.

00:25.008 --> 00:26.443
Chicken pox when he was 9,

00:26.477 --> 00:29.178
and he dislocated his shoulder
playing football in university.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.681
I know. I know. I know any
history of concussions?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.066
(sighs) No. I mean,

00:33.117 --> 00:35.368
none that would have brought
him to the hospital, anyway.

00:35.403 --> 00:36.519
One step forward. Two steps back.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.622
Come on, guys. What are we missing here?

00:39.657 --> 00:41.357
- Alex.
- Yeah.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.543
- Hey.
- Huh?

00:43.577 --> 00:44.744
The fact that Charlie's
breathing on his own...

00:44.779 --> 00:46.463
- that's monumental.
- That's great news.

00:46.497 --> 00:49.883
I know. I'm just... (laughs)
I'm impatient, you know?

00:49.917 --> 00:53.253
I... I'm happy he's come this far.

00:53.304 --> 00:54.921
No, don't do that.
Don't... don't do that, Alex.

00:54.972 --> 00:57.590
Don't settle. Don't be
happy with just this.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.008
Hey, Charlie.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.646
You're looking more like
your old self, Charlie.

01:03.681 --> 01:07.801
Every day is one step closer
to bringing you back to me.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.655
I've got rounds.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.491
I love you, handsome. (kisses)

01:20.063 --> 01:22.198
And I love you.

01:25.569 --> 01:27.504
(knock on door) Yep.

01:27.538 --> 01:29.706
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

01:29.740 --> 01:32.909
No, Bryan, come on in.

01:33.369 --> 01:34.736
Please.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.180
- Sit down.
- How's everything going?

01:37.214 --> 01:39.248
Really well. I was just going
over the quarterly reports,

01:39.266 --> 01:41.684
and it looks like
we've decreased wait times

01:41.719 --> 01:43.553
between cases in the O.R.

01:43.587 --> 01:44.687
Well, that's what we like to hear.

01:44.722 --> 01:47.724
I assume you heard about Charlie.

01:47.758 --> 01:50.527
What, breathing on his own?
Wonderful news.

01:50.561 --> 01:52.695
Really, for him and for Dr. Reid.

01:52.730 --> 01:54.531
Still, the chances of
Charlie resuming his role

01:54.565 --> 01:56.900
of chief of surgery are slim,

01:56.934 --> 01:58.451
and the board has decided
that Hope Zion doesn't need

01:58.486 --> 02:01.454
an interim chief of surgery.
We need an actual replacement.

02:01.646 --> 02:02.679
I see. Mm-hmm.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.279
We're opening
the position up across the country,

02:04.335 --> 02:05.625
and I'd like you to have
your name in the mix.

02:07.077 --> 02:08.082
In the mix.

02:08.497 --> 02:10.213
Can I ask, is that just a formality?

02:10.247 --> 02:11.781
Ah. It's just a process.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.783
Anyway, posting's going up later today,

02:13.801 --> 02:16.118
and we look forward to
receiving your application.

02:17.312 --> 02:19.651
I'll let you get back to it.
Dana, I know you're very busy.

02:19.838 --> 02:20.911
Thank you.

02:21.124 --> 02:22.475
(door opens)

02:22.510 --> 02:23.943
Thank you.

02:23.978 --> 02:27.296
(indistinct conversations)

02:27.314 --> 02:28.932
Okay, hit me. What's next?

02:28.966 --> 02:30.316
Uh, well, let's go in
order of stupidity, okay?

02:30.351 --> 02:32.485
We have a teenage girl who
swallowed so much pool water,

02:32.520 --> 02:33.770
she's vomiting blood,

02:33.804 --> 02:35.805
A water skier who impaled
himself on a tree branch,

02:35.823 --> 02:37.907
and last but not least, a 300-pound man

02:37.942 --> 02:39.742
with impacted stool due to overconsumption

02:39.777 --> 02:41.611
of watermelon seeds.

02:41.645 --> 02:42.862
You made that last one up, right?

02:42.913 --> 02:44.814
You're right. He's probably 350 pounds.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.949
Hmm.

02:47.564 --> 02:48.951
(Zach) What do you got, Joe?

02:49.002 --> 02:52.038
Kendra Watt, 35-year-old female.
She's been seizing.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.673
Laceration to her forehead,
bleeding profusely.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.758
She's hypotensive, about 90 over 60,

02:55.793 --> 02:57.460
tachycardic, and jaundiced.

02:57.494 --> 03:00.880
(Maggie) I think that's
Dr. Kendra from that TV show.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.333
How'd she cut herself?

03:04.351 --> 03:05.385
Sir, I found her like this

03:05.436 --> 03:06.502
when I went to pick her up this morning.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.854
I'm her assistant, Kate.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.106
- How long ago was that?
- Uh, maybe half an hour.

03:10.140 --> 03:11.191
Okay.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.309
Whoa!

03:13.343 --> 03:15.041
That wound is superficial
it shouldn't still be bleeding.

03:15.077 --> 03:15.861
Any idea what happened?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.008
Um... well...

03:18.044 --> 03:19.603
You're not gonna
get in trouble. Just say it.

03:19.846 --> 03:21.517
- You've seen the show, right?
- Yeah, once or twice.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.852
Well, Kendra's a very spiritual person,

03:22.870 --> 03:25.205
and last night she said
she wanted to expand her mind.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.856
So she took mushrooms.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.209
- Could be Amanita poisoning.
- What's that?

03:29.243 --> 03:30.543
Amanita Phalloides is also
known as the death cap.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.545
Easily mistaken for magic mushrooms.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.796
Your boss is showing all the symptoms

03:33.831 --> 03:35.064
for fulminant liver failure.

03:35.099 --> 03:36.466
All right, let's add in acetylcysteine

03:36.500 --> 03:38.635
and F.F.P.
for the bleeding and whole blood.

03:38.669 --> 03:40.386
Did you go on this trip with her, Kate?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.721
No. No, no. Mushrooms aren't my thing.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.973
So you're not gonna tell
anybody about this, right?

03:44.008 --> 03:47.227
Because Kendra will be majorly
pissed if this comes out.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.645
Like, pissed at me.

03:48.679 --> 03:51.547
- Do you have any mushrooms left?
- I brought some just in case.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.565
Great. Thanks. Find a myocologist

03:52.600 --> 03:53.983
so we can identify them. In the meantime,

03:54.018 --> 03:55.735
let's do blood work, C.B.C., coags,

03:55.769 --> 03:58.554
L.F.T.S, and ammonia levels,

03:58.572 --> 04:00.857
and, um, oh, you know what?
Call the hepatologist

04:00.891 --> 04:02.742
and get him to contact
the liver transplant team.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.894
What? What, y-you have
to do a liver transplant?

04:04.912 --> 04:07.080
It may be the only way to save her life.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.125 --> 04:19.625
How is he?

04:19.677 --> 04:21.678
He's good. I need to figure
out why he's still under,

04:21.712 --> 04:24.514
- but, uh, he's-he's great.
- Good.

04:24.548 --> 04:28.584
Uh... Look, Alex,
I-I know you're disappointed

04:28.602 --> 04:30.520
about losing chief resident.

04:30.554 --> 04:32.355
Well, I am. I can't lie.

04:32.389 --> 04:33.756
But...

04:33.774 --> 04:36.526
I hope you don't feel
like I'm punishing you.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.361
I don't.

04:38.395 --> 04:40.396
The truth is, I can't give
you what you need right now.

04:40.430 --> 04:42.782
You made the hard call, and I accept it.

04:42.816 --> 04:46.602
Okay. Well... Thank you
for being so professional.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.104
You're welcome.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.325
But when Charlie is out of the woods,

04:52.376 --> 04:53.793
I'm gonna wanna revisit this.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.946
And so you should, and...

04:56.964 --> 04:58.815
I am really happy about Charlie.

04:58.849 --> 05:00.333
Thank you.

05:02.285 --> 05:03.803
Nothing's working, Dr. Miller.
Her vitals are down.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.555
- She's hypotensive.
- No, no, no.

05:05.589 --> 05:06.923
No, doctor, she cannot die.

05:06.957 --> 05:08.457
(woman) She's seizing.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.726
Hepatic encephalopathy.

05:09.760 --> 05:10.893
(monitor beeping erratically)

05:10.928 --> 05:13.262
I got no pulse. All right, start C.P.R.

05:13.296 --> 05:15.648
Give me an amp of epi, stat. And bag her.

05:15.683 --> 05:16.899
Get the intubation equipment ready.

05:16.934 --> 05:19.102
Saline's running. I.V.'s wide open.

05:19.136 --> 05:20.570
Pause for rhythm check.

05:20.604 --> 05:21.904
No pulse.

05:21.939 --> 05:24.557
Pulseless electrical activity.
All right, resuming C.P.R.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.909
Give me an amp of atropine.

05:26.944 --> 05:29.696
No one can see me.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.833
None of you...

05:33.867 --> 05:36.836
can... see me.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.504
Oh, my god.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.124
This is amazing.

05:41.158 --> 05:42.291
Boo!

05:42.325 --> 05:46.295
Oh! So... uh, you <i>can</i> see me.

05:46.329 --> 05:47.797
- Yeah.
- But why?

05:47.831 --> 05:51.601
Is... This is my trip, and...

05:51.635 --> 05:55.138
why are you here,
and why are you wearing a tuxedo?

05:55.172 --> 05:56.672
Your-your trip?

05:56.690 --> 05:59.275
I'm expanding my mind.

05:59.309 --> 06:01.194
Ohh.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.312
Oh, I wish this <i>was</i> your trip.

06:03.346 --> 06:05.498
Okay.

06:05.532 --> 06:09.202
That is... actually quite profound.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.154
What?

06:11.188 --> 06:12.872
Okay, gonna make the first
incision longitudinally

06:12.906 --> 06:15.375
over the F.C.U. in
the distal half of the forearm.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.960
Then I'm going to to
transect the F.C.U. tendon

06:17.995 --> 06:20.963
from the pisiform and detach it
as far distally as I can.

06:20.998 --> 06:21.998
Knife.

06:22.032 --> 06:25.034
(monitor beeping steadily)

06:33.494 --> 06:34.911
(beeps)

06:36.432 --> 06:38.898
Joel? Everything okay?

06:38.932 --> 06:39.982
Uh...

06:40.017 --> 06:41.734
Oh.

06:41.769 --> 06:45.238
I can't do this.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.722
Uh, my hand's cramping. I actually...

06:46.740 --> 06:48.324
Uh, you're gonna have to find
yourself another orthopod.

06:48.358 --> 06:49.475
This is your surgery.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.277
I know. I'm sorry.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.283
Victor, will you call Dr. Simons?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.619
- Have him come to the O.R.
- I'm on it.

07:07.911 --> 07:10.880
(breathing heavily)

07:24.095 --> 07:25.795
So how'd it go in there?

07:25.813 --> 07:26.963
Surgery was successful.

07:26.981 --> 07:30.183
Function fully restored
to the wrist and thumb.

07:30.234 --> 07:31.434
You were missed.

07:31.468 --> 07:32.886
Yeah, well, the last thing I wanted to do

07:32.920 --> 07:34.855
was to operate on a patient
with a compromised hand.

07:34.906 --> 07:37.824
You know, Dana, I know I said
I should come back to work,

07:37.859 --> 07:41.161
but I really think that I need
to take a leave of absence.

07:41.195 --> 07:44.498
Joel, it's okay.
You just need to clear your head,

07:44.532 --> 07:46.199
take a little break.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.817
What's your schedule like for the day?

07:47.835 --> 07:51.321
Um, I had scheduled a knee arthroscopy

07:51.339 --> 07:52.622
and a hip replacement.

07:52.656 --> 07:55.091
Oh, Simons can cover those.
You're coming with me.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.826
I'm coming with you where?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.455
You ever heard
of a little town called Elsinore?

07:58.521 --> 07:59.189
I've read "Hamlet."

07:59.235 --> 08:01.164
Ha ha. Different Elsinore.
I grew up there.

08:01.182 --> 08:02.883
I'm doing a C.M.E.

08:02.934 --> 08:04.050
I don't know...

08:04.101 --> 08:05.352
I do.

08:05.386 --> 08:06.436
You need to clear your head,
and I can use your help.

08:06.470 --> 08:07.804
You go get a toothbrush,

08:07.838 --> 08:08.972
grab an extra shirt from your locker.

08:09.006 --> 08:10.690
You meet me at my car in 30 minutes, okay?

08:10.725 --> 08:12.943
Little road trip. It'll be fun.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.845
So you're in a coma.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.098
Yep, three months now,
but my neurosurgeon says

08:18.132 --> 08:20.016
my brain is healing nicely,
and I could wake up any day now.

08:20.034 --> 08:21.868
- What happened?
- Car accident.

08:21.903 --> 08:23.620
Oh. Limo driver?

08:23.654 --> 08:25.205
Surgeon. Publicist?

08:25.239 --> 08:26.406
- I have two.
- Hmm?

08:26.457 --> 08:28.524
I'm a therapist. Might have seen my show.

08:28.543 --> 08:29.543
Dr. Kendra.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.411
Dr. Phil. Dr. Oz. Dr. Kendra.

08:31.462 --> 08:32.879
So when you say you're a doctor...

08:32.914 --> 08:34.381
I'm a licensed psychiatrist.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.698
You don't just play one on TV?

08:35.716 --> 08:37.299
That's <i>hilarious.</i>

08:37.335 --> 08:38.301
(Charlie laughs)

08:38.336 --> 08:40.503
Uh, so... what now?

08:40.537 --> 08:41.703
Oh, well, now I guess your brain readjusts

08:41.722 --> 08:43.706
and you stop seeing me.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.809
Oh, so you've done this before...

08:45.843 --> 08:48.144
- interacted with people...
- Coma patients, dead people.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.346
A psychic once. He was an ass.

08:49.380 --> 08:50.564
- Dead people?
- Yeah.

08:50.598 --> 08:53.883
Wow. Well... You don't think that I'm...

08:53.901 --> 08:57.487
I don't know. Uh, what's
the last thing you remember?

08:57.521 --> 09:00.440
I was... in my condo.

09:00.491 --> 09:03.526
I'd just taken mushrooms.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.896
Things got a bit unpleasant,
and then I wound up here.

09:06.914 --> 09:07.914
Unpleasant how?

09:07.949 --> 09:12.802
I threw up a couple of times.

09:12.837 --> 09:13.870
Why am I here?

09:15.706 --> 09:19.092
(indistinct conversations)

09:19.126 --> 09:20.844
(child coughing in distance)

09:20.878 --> 09:23.430
Tom, I just... uh,
I wanted to say congratulations

09:23.464 --> 09:25.248
on becoming chief surgical resident.

09:25.266 --> 09:26.433
Thank you.

09:26.467 --> 09:27.884
Now I know this must be awkward for you

09:27.918 --> 09:31.421
because it's incredibly
awkward for me, but I...

09:31.439 --> 09:34.090
Why would it be awkward for me?

09:40.931 --> 09:42.232
174. That makes it...

09:42.266 --> 09:46.269
(gasps) A full 120 pounds
gone forever. Buh-bye!

09:46.287 --> 09:48.071
Congratulations, Doug. And I probably

09:48.105 --> 09:50.240
shouldn't say this, but you look hot.

09:50.274 --> 09:52.125
Oh, please, stop.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.244
No, actually, don't stop.
Keep going. Tell me more.

09:54.278 --> 09:56.946
(laughs) Dr. Reid,
you have created a monster.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.665
Yeah, well, I spent
the first 28 years of my life

09:58.716 --> 10:01.784
sitting on my ass eating
fast food and watching TV.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.454
You've given me a new
lease on life, Dr. Reid,

10:04.472 --> 10:07.290
and I'm, uh, I'm running with it.
(cell phone vibrating)

10:07.308 --> 10:09.559
Dougie, turn it off, please. Half an hour.

10:09.593 --> 10:10.810
It's okay if you need to talk.

10:10.845 --> 10:13.029
Oh, talk. Is that what the boys are doing

10:13.064 --> 10:14.981
on your little app? Are they talking?

10:15.016 --> 10:16.099
It's like facebook for gays.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.267
(chuckles) Except for

10:17.301 --> 10:18.985
instead of friending people, you...

10:19.020 --> 10:20.487
Oh, yeah, okay. I...

10:20.521 --> 10:21.804
It's a harmless ego boost. That's all.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.741
Because hello... mission accomplished.

10:24.775 --> 10:26.493
That's the best way to fall in love...

10:26.527 --> 10:27.777
with your best friend.

10:27.811 --> 10:29.245
After he loses half
his body weight, of course.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.415
So, Doug, let's go over
the rest of your test results.

10:32.450 --> 10:35.335
Everything looks good.
B12 levels are fine.

10:35.369 --> 10:36.920
Cholesterol's normal.

10:36.954 --> 10:39.289
Iron's a bit low, so we should
work on getting that back up.

10:39.323 --> 10:40.623
Mm-hmm.

10:40.657 --> 10:42.375
But other than that,
if there's anything else...

10:42.426 --> 10:43.460
Mm.

10:43.494 --> 10:44.827
- Okay.
- Doug.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.630
(sighs) She's not my G.P.
She's my surgeon.

10:47.664 --> 10:48.664
That's okay. What's up?

10:48.683 --> 10:51.834
I was at the gym a couple weeks ago,

10:51.852 --> 10:53.853
on the pec deck, when my hand slipped,

10:53.888 --> 10:55.355
and the bar fell on my chest.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.856
It doesn't hurt anymore,

10:56.891 --> 10:59.842
but it feels a little
swollen on the left side.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.844
Well, it's probably
just soft tissue damage.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.364
But just hop up on the table there.

11:04.398 --> 11:08.068
You can take your shirt off,
and I'll, uh, have a look.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.321
Here we go.

11:11.355 --> 11:13.856
(chuckles)

11:13.874 --> 11:15.709
It is a little swollen.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.210
- Tender?
- Mm.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.028
Yeah? (clears throat)

11:21.882 --> 11:24.334
Hmm.

11:24.368 --> 11:26.002
What's wrong?

11:26.036 --> 11:27.303
I'm just gonna check something out,

11:27.338 --> 11:29.705
and I will be right back. Hang tight.

11:34.228 --> 11:35.645
I was doing a chest exam
on a patient just now.

11:35.679 --> 11:37.313
- Kinky.
- Not really.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.265
- He dropped a barbell on it a couple week.
- Kinkier.

11:39.316 --> 11:41.985
When I got to his nipple and pressed,

11:42.019 --> 11:43.153
there was red discharge.

11:43.187 --> 11:44.904
- Steroids.
- Steroids?

11:44.939 --> 11:46.406
Yep. Roids lead to gynecomastia,

11:46.440 --> 11:49.058
which can lead to nipple discharge.

11:49.076 --> 11:52.245
Your patient's probably juicing. Thanks.

11:53.864 --> 11:56.750
Yeah, she didn't make it. Hey.

11:56.784 --> 11:57.834
- Hey.
- Where are you going?

11:57.868 --> 12:00.703
- Uh, field trip with Kinney.
- Field trip?

12:00.737 --> 12:03.706
Mm-hmm. It's like a continuing
medical education thing.

12:03.740 --> 12:04.758
I'll be back tomorrow.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.010
Tomorrow. Lucky you.

12:07.044 --> 12:09.245
What, is that a problem?

12:09.263 --> 12:10.580
Have you seen the posting?

12:10.598 --> 12:11.914
They're looking for
a new chief of surgery.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.466
Yeah, we already have a chief of surgery.

12:13.517 --> 12:15.101
We have an interim chief of surgery,

12:15.136 --> 12:17.720
so is Kinney going on a field trip,

12:17.754 --> 12:20.640
or is she looking for a new job?

12:20.691 --> 12:23.860
Well, <i>that</i> would be gossip.

12:25.362 --> 12:29.949
(man) ♪ I feel so good all the time ♪

12:29.984 --> 12:33.036
<i>♪ I need you here by my side ♪</i>

12:33.070 --> 12:34.370
How long have you been doing this?

12:34.405 --> 12:35.572
- What, the C.M.E.S?
- Yeah.

12:35.910 --> 12:38.077
I don't know. About ten years?

12:38.876 --> 12:40.210
You know, it just gives the surgeons

12:40.244 --> 12:42.445
in these small towns a chance
to update their skill sets,

12:42.463 --> 12:43.463
- and...
- That's cool.

12:43.497 --> 12:44.714
Yeah.

12:44.748 --> 12:46.115
Tell me something. Why is the hospital

12:46.133 --> 12:47.750
looking for a new chief of surgery?

12:47.784 --> 12:49.669
The posting's up already, yeah?

12:49.720 --> 12:51.137
Yeah.

12:51.172 --> 12:53.590
Well, they're not looking for
a new chief, necessarily.

12:53.624 --> 12:56.309
- I mean, I'm in the mix.
- You're in the mix.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.645
- (laughs) Come on.
- And, yeah, well, it's a big job, Joel.

12:58.679 --> 13:00.230
Right, which you've been
doing incredibly well at.

13:00.264 --> 13:01.464
Now there's a process when
you hire the chief of surgery.

13:01.482 --> 13:02.732
I understand that there's a process.

13:02.766 --> 13:04.601
- It's called find
- the best person for the job.

13:04.635 --> 13:06.314
How is that not you? I just...

13:06.334 --> 13:06.940
Well...

13:06.957 --> 13:09.438
I mean, with your experience
and track record and performance

13:09.473 --> 13:13.743
it just feels, uh, it just feels wrong.

13:13.777 --> 13:15.829
Well, it was never a done deal, all right?

13:15.863 --> 13:19.582
So I apply, and hopefully I get it.

13:21.085 --> 13:23.086
See, I never figured
you were so gallant, Joel.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.122
(chuckles) I'm not.

13:26.156 --> 13:27.924
(chuckles)

Trust me, I'm not.

(car door closes)

13:49.446 --> 13:50.480
(bells tolling) This is where I grew up.

13:50.514 --> 13:52.115
Remind me to stock up on my quilts, fudge,

13:52.149 --> 13:53.349
and maple sugar while I'm here.

13:53.367 --> 13:55.017
(laughs) Dana?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.370
- Stephanie?
- I'm in shock.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.873
- I did not expect to run into you today.
- Oh, my gosh!

13:59.907 --> 14:02.024
- Wow.
- I thought you and John were out west.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.626
Well, we were, but we moved back
two years ago with the girls.

14:03.661 --> 14:05.161
- Oh, my god.
- This is home again.

14:05.195 --> 14:06.862
And I'm just overnight working.
If I'd known you were here,

14:06.881 --> 14:09.165
- I would have e-mailed.
- Don't worry about it.

14:09.199 --> 14:10.499
Can you drop by for dinner,
see the new place?

14:10.535 --> 14:11.467
Yeah, absolutely.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.536
Listen, I'll tell you what.
As soon as I'm finished here,

14:13.554 --> 14:14.671
- I'll give a call. We'll make a plan.
- Okay, but you don't have my number.

14:14.705 --> 14:16.055
- Are you listed?
- Of course I'm listed.

14:16.090 --> 14:18.341
- Fantastic.
- Dr. Kinney.

14:18.375 --> 14:19.893
So wonderful to finally meet you.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.877
Oh, wonderful to meet you, too.
I'm not Dr. Kinney.

14:21.896 --> 14:24.180
- This is, uh, Dana Kinney right here.
- Better let you go.

14:24.214 --> 14:25.214
Okay, bye. Bye-bye.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.567
(chuckles) Uh, I am so sorry.

14:27.601 --> 14:29.652
- I-I presumed that...
- That's fine.

14:29.687 --> 14:31.387
It's one of those names...
can be either/or.

14:31.405 --> 14:33.489
So you ready for us to talk your ears off?

14:33.524 --> 14:35.525
Only if you teach us how
to sign them back on.

14:35.559 --> 14:37.527
(laughs)

14:43.601 --> 14:46.119
(siren wailing)

14:46.154 --> 14:47.821
I've done drugs. I'm not gonna lie,

14:47.872 --> 14:49.539
but I have never taken steroids.

14:49.574 --> 14:51.875
And a year ago, you didn't
look like Chris Evans, either.

14:51.909 --> 14:53.994
That's because I've been working out.

14:54.045 --> 14:56.646
Dr. Reid, I swear I'm clean.

14:56.681 --> 14:58.648
Okay, you need to respect
that a gastric bypass

14:58.683 --> 15:00.433
isn't just a cosmetic procedure.

15:00.468 --> 15:02.185
Steroids can cause cancer.

15:02.220 --> 15:03.687
They can cause cardiovascular problems.

15:03.721 --> 15:05.055
- And shrunken gonads.
- Yes.

15:05.089 --> 15:08.008
Okay, I got it. Why are
you even asking me this?

15:08.059 --> 15:09.792
Because nipple discharge is a sign,

15:09.811 --> 15:13.313
and when I pressed on your chest,
that's what happened.

15:13.347 --> 15:15.682
So, please, let me run some more tests.

15:15.733 --> 15:17.984
I'll figure out what's going on.

15:18.019 --> 15:20.070
Okay. Sure.

15:20.104 --> 15:21.488
My diagnosis is that he's suffering injury

15:21.522 --> 15:22.823
to his C5 and C6,

15:22.857 --> 15:24.508
possibly a nerve root avulsion.

15:24.542 --> 15:27.077
- That's a classic brachial plexus injury.
- So how do you fix it?

15:27.111 --> 15:28.645
Normally, I'd send him down
to you in the big city.

15:28.663 --> 15:29.646
Actually, he does have
an appointment with us

15:29.664 --> 15:30.914
later this month.

15:30.948 --> 15:32.449
Well, right now Craig is
your case study, so...

15:32.483 --> 15:34.985
Okay, well, depending on the damage,

15:35.019 --> 15:36.203
I'd graft the nerves.

15:36.254 --> 15:38.338
- Mm-hmm.
- Why wouldn't you transfer?

15:38.372 --> 15:39.422
It's been proven to be more effective

15:39.457 --> 15:40.990
at restoring the strength.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.510
- Transfers can lead to complications.
- Not if you do them right.

15:43.544 --> 15:45.662
Actually, both methods work.
If you were going to...

15:45.680 --> 15:47.997
What would you do, Dr. Kinney?

15:48.015 --> 15:50.767
I would use the spinal accessory nerve

15:50.801 --> 15:53.136
to graft the C5 and C6 nerve roots,

15:53.170 --> 15:56.172
and then I'd perform a F.C.U.
to the E.C.R.B. transfer

15:56.190 --> 15:58.308
to address the loss of wrist dorsiflexion.

15:58.342 --> 16:00.843
As a matter of fact,
I've just published a paper on this

16:00.862 --> 16:03.113
in the "journal of plastic
and reconstructive surgery"

16:03.147 --> 16:05.815
if you'd like to read up on the procedure.

16:05.849 --> 16:07.067
All right, Dr. Carson,

16:07.118 --> 16:10.620
so let's talk about how
we do a nerve graft.

16:16.494 --> 16:17.527
I'm dead.

16:17.545 --> 16:19.529
Yeah.

16:19.547 --> 16:21.831
Sorry.

16:23.718 --> 16:26.253
You guys can take her down to the morgue.

16:30.374 --> 16:32.208
I know I should be handling this better,

16:32.226 --> 16:35.228
but... I'm not.

16:35.263 --> 16:37.898
Yeah, so we're gonna have
to send out a press release.

16:37.932 --> 16:40.183
Uh, "Dr. Kendra Watts,
expert in her field,"

16:40.217 --> 16:41.401
"died at age..."

16:41.435 --> 16:43.186
35. I'm 35.

16:43.220 --> 16:45.388
(laughs) I know.
She's not like a real doctor,

16:45.406 --> 16:47.908
but it's a press release,
so she can't come off like a hack.

16:47.942 --> 16:49.659
A hack?

16:49.694 --> 16:52.529
- A hack?! I am not a hack!
- Whoa, calm down, calm down.

16:52.563 --> 16:54.731
- I have a degree. I have <i>two</i> degrees.
- I-I know. I get that.

16:54.749 --> 16:55.911
- That ungrateful little...
- I know.

16:55.962 --> 16:57.000
She didn't even know how to use

16:57.025 --> 16:57.866
- a fax machine.
- She can't hear you.

16:57.901 --> 16:59.119
- So let it go.
- She didn't know what a latte was.

16:59.170 --> 17:01.087
Let it go. Let it go.

17:01.122 --> 17:04.674
Let it <i>go.</i>

17:04.709 --> 17:07.844
Go.

17:07.877 --> 17:08.845
(elevator bell dings)

17:08.878 --> 17:10.347
Whoa.

17:10.381 --> 17:14.684
When I wake up in, like,
12 hours from now,

17:14.719 --> 17:16.185
and I'm done this trip...

17:16.220 --> 17:18.954
You're not gonna wake up, Kendra.

17:18.990 --> 17:20.190
Sorry.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.780
So... what now?

17:26.814 --> 17:29.599
Uh, now you move on to
whatever happens next,

17:29.617 --> 17:33.320
but if you're sticking around,
and it kinda looks like you are,

17:33.371 --> 17:34.621
it's usually for a reason.

17:34.655 --> 17:36.189
What kind of reason?

17:36.223 --> 17:39.108
Well, you took mushrooms.

17:39.126 --> 17:42.295
Oh, god. Shrooms.

17:42.330 --> 17:46.299
Oh! My god. What an idiot I am.

17:46.334 --> 17:49.169
Who am I? Some undergrad who
just read William Burroughs

17:49.220 --> 17:51.054
for the first time?

17:51.088 --> 17:52.555
God, I could die of embarrassment

17:52.590 --> 17:53.723
if I wasn't already dead.

17:53.758 --> 17:55.759
Why'd you take them, Kendra?

17:55.793 --> 17:58.294
Because we just shot the hundredth episode

17:58.312 --> 18:00.397
of my TV show,
and you know what the topic was?

18:00.431 --> 18:01.648
No.

18:01.682 --> 18:02.932
Celebrity baby names.

18:02.966 --> 18:04.401
Okay.

18:04.435 --> 18:08.104
Celebrity baby names.
I am a serious therapist.

18:08.138 --> 18:11.191
I got into this business
to help people, you know?

18:11.242 --> 18:12.575
To help elicit real change,
and then suddenly,

18:12.610 --> 18:15.078
I'm doing a show about
celebrity baby names.

18:15.112 --> 18:20.583
So I just thought, you know,
I need to get out of myself

18:20.618 --> 18:24.537
and gain perspective and
focus again on what's real

18:24.588 --> 18:28.041
and then suddenly, I'm dead.

18:28.092 --> 18:32.095
And now I'm a bigger joke
dead than I was alive.

18:32.129 --> 18:33.496
(sighs)

18:36.851 --> 18:41.104
So... why are you here?

18:41.138 --> 18:43.506
Not sure I understand the question.

18:43.524 --> 18:47.360
Well, you are stuck here
and not in your body. Why?

18:47.395 --> 18:49.646
Uh... traumatic brain injury.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.521
But you said you were healing.

18:50.566 --> 18:52.648
I am, but there's something
the doctors are missing.

18:52.683 --> 18:56.853
Perhaps there's something... unresolved?

18:59.323 --> 19:00.990
You rotate the flap over

19:01.024 --> 19:03.076
and suture the z-plasty into place.

19:03.127 --> 19:04.461
- You wanna give that a try?
- Okay.

19:04.495 --> 19:06.913
Do you want a coffee?

19:07.092 --> 19:08.166
Yeah, thank you.

19:09.563 --> 19:12.168
Dr. Kinney, thank you
for coming out today.

19:12.202 --> 19:14.921
Oh, my pleasure. You've got
a fine group of surgeons.

19:14.972 --> 19:16.089
Thank you.

19:16.140 --> 19:17.874
- Can I ask you something, though?
- Of course.

19:17.892 --> 19:20.643
Why do you only have one
woman on your staff?

19:20.678 --> 19:22.378
I mean, women make up more
than half the medical students

19:22.396 --> 19:23.546
- in this country...
- Look, Dana,

19:23.564 --> 19:25.265
I would love to hire
more women if I could,

19:25.316 --> 19:27.517
but the fact is, do you have
any idea how difficult it is

19:27.551 --> 19:29.602
- for me to recruit to a rural hospital?
- Why?

19:29.653 --> 19:32.572
And women doctors
eventually start families.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.941
That's the reality, and then
they don't come back to work.

19:34.992 --> 19:36.055
I have two children.

19:36.055 --> 19:38.393
Well, then you're the exception,
aren't you?

19:38.412 --> 19:39.913
Look, I'm not saying it's not fair...

19:39.947 --> 19:42.449
It's more than unfair.
It's discrimination.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.451
Well, interpret it however you want.

19:44.502 --> 19:48.455
Fact is, when I hire a surgeon,
I wanna keep that surgeon.

19:48.506 --> 19:50.373
You work in a very different
world, Dr. Kinney.

19:50.407 --> 19:52.008
Actually, no, I don't.

19:52.042 --> 19:54.794
(cell phone rings)

19:54.845 --> 19:58.581
(sighs) Dr. McBride here.

19:58.599 --> 20:00.467
Oh, hey, Christy. What's up?

20:00.518 --> 20:02.051
No, I'm not at the hospital.

20:02.085 --> 20:03.770
What?

20:03.804 --> 20:06.856
Okay, I'll be right there.
Did you call 9-1-1?

20:06.891 --> 20:08.274
Good. Okay. Bye-bye.

20:08.309 --> 20:09.726
- What's up?
- Hey, is everything okay?

20:09.760 --> 20:12.729
Uh, an accident downtown.
A truck hit a pedestrian.

20:12.763 --> 20:14.697
- Do you want our help?
- Uh, yeah, come on.

20:14.732 --> 20:18.735
Oh, thank god, Ronnie.
She's trapped under there.

20:18.769 --> 20:21.871
(gasping)

20:21.906 --> 20:23.206
(whispers) Stephanie.

20:23.240 --> 20:26.576
(crying)

20:30.479 --> 20:32.647
Stephanie. Stephanie, can you hear me?

20:32.681 --> 20:33.982
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me.

20:34.016 --> 20:35.350
Okay, good. Don't try and talk.

20:35.384 --> 20:36.901
You're gonna lie still. It's okay.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.186
We're gonna get you out of here.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.905
Okay, multiple polytrauma
to her face, her legs.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.890
No external bleeding.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.075
Truck must be acting as a tourniquet,

20:44.109 --> 20:46.060
Preventing her from bleeding out.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.328
How much does this thing weigh?

20:47.363 --> 20:50.164
10 tons, at least.
Too heavy to lift hydraulically.

20:50.199 --> 20:51.833
And we can't drag it off her,
not with her underneath it.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.585
We need a crane, something to lift it.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.069
She's losing her airway.
We have to crike her.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.088
Ambulance is at least 15 minutes
away over in Springmount.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.040
15 minutes? We don't have 15 minutes.

20:59.074 --> 21:01.092
Okay, I need a first aid
kit and an oxygen tank.

21:01.126 --> 21:03.177
- I've got a first aid kit.
- Her face is fractured.

21:03.212 --> 21:04.596
She'll have teeth and debris
in the back of her throat.

21:04.630 --> 21:05.880
We're gonna have to go in below.

21:05.914 --> 21:08.216
Needle crike? I've never done one.

21:08.250 --> 21:11.419
Neither have I, not on a real patient.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.388
Joel, I still need that first aid kit.

21:13.422 --> 21:16.357
Do you have a first aid
kit in there, please?

21:16.392 --> 21:19.360
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

21:19.395 --> 21:20.928
Okay.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.931
All right. How's that leg?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.366
Well, I can't see all of it.

21:25.401 --> 21:27.768
It's a partial traumatic amputation,

21:27.786 --> 21:29.270
open femur fracture.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.455
She's degloved.

21:30.489 --> 21:32.740
Here.

21:32.774 --> 21:33.908
Okay, that's perfect.

21:33.942 --> 21:36.110
We're gonna do this fast and dirty.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.795
Cover and uncover.

21:37.830 --> 21:38.796
(click)

21:38.831 --> 21:40.582
Oxygen goes into her chest,

21:40.616 --> 21:42.050
comes out here.

21:42.084 --> 21:43.251
Syringe.

21:43.285 --> 21:45.920
Steph? It's gonna help you breathe, okay?

21:45.954 --> 21:47.138
There. (whimpering)

21:47.172 --> 21:50.642
Okay. Hold steady.

21:50.676 --> 21:53.261
Attach the tubing to the needle.

21:53.295 --> 21:54.929
(crying)

21:54.963 --> 21:58.399
Open it to 15 liters per minute.

22:04.139 --> 22:06.641
Okay, we just bought her 20 minutes.

22:06.659 --> 22:10.144
Where is she? Mom!

22:10.162 --> 22:11.785
- It's okay. Come here.
- No!

22:11.785 --> 22:12.139
Mom!

22:12.139 --> 22:13.447
You need to stay back. You need to stay back.

22:13.482 --> 22:15.500
- Okay.
- Emma, it's okay.

22:15.534 --> 22:16.534
(Joel) It's okay.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.956
Doug, your ultrasound results
came back in from the imaging.

22:21.990 --> 22:23.991
It looks like the pain and
swelling in your chest

22:24.009 --> 22:26.427
may be a tumor... Breast cancer.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.445
Breast cancer? I'm a guy.

22:29.658 --> 22:30.848
Men can get breast cancer, too.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.167
It's rare, but if you
have a family history,

22:33.185 --> 22:34.769
or if you're overweight.

22:34.803 --> 22:38.439
(sighs) So this is god's way
of punishing me for being fat?

22:38.474 --> 22:40.959
No, are-are you sure, Dr. Reid?
This couldn't be something else?

22:40.993 --> 22:42.610
The only way to know for
sure is to do a biopsy.

22:42.645 --> 22:44.345
It's simple. I stick a needle in,

22:44.363 --> 22:45.980
get a sample, then I take it to the lab

22:46.014 --> 22:47.782
and they test it for cancer cells.

22:47.816 --> 22:49.484
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:49.518 --> 22:50.685
Okay.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.490
So, first things first.
I'm gonna numb the area.

22:55.524 --> 22:57.041
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.745
(monitor beeping steadily)

23:00.796 --> 23:02.863
Needle and ultrasound, please.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.051
Got it. Great.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.337
You might wanna look away.

23:09.371 --> 23:10.872
Mm. You're gonna hear

23:10.906 --> 23:14.042
a little pop as
the needle removes the sample.

23:15.244 --> 23:16.227
(click, ultrasound whooshing)

23:16.261 --> 23:17.895
There you go. All done.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.847
Just put a rush on the sample, okay?

23:19.881 --> 23:21.399
Why?

23:21.433 --> 23:22.550
Breast cancer's found late in men

23:22.568 --> 23:23.735
because nobody's looking for it.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.720
So the faster we deal
with this, the better.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.721
Okay.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.623
It won't be long.

23:31.860 --> 23:34.412
This is not some after
school job at McDonald's.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.914
You cannot show up late
for your shift. Hey!

23:36.949 --> 23:38.850
Not even five minutes. Understood?

23:39.952 --> 23:41.369
Go.

23:41.403 --> 23:44.756
(sighs)

23:44.790 --> 23:45.923
Hey, Reycraft.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.742
Listen, I know it's frustrating

23:47.760 --> 23:48.960
when doctors are late for work,

23:49.011 --> 23:50.545
but next time, just take
him to task in private.

23:50.579 --> 23:51.879
- Alex.
- Yeah.

23:51.913 --> 23:54.348
- You're no longer chief surgical resident.
- I know that.

23:54.383 --> 23:55.600
Good, then I hope you won't feel the need

23:55.634 --> 23:56.718
to tell me how to do my job.

23:56.752 --> 24:00.772
(sighs) Wouldn't dream of it.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.090
Kendra, I appreciate that
you're trying to help,

24:02.124 --> 24:03.725
but the whole unresolved thing

24:03.759 --> 24:06.194
is usually reserved for the dead,
not the living.

24:06.228 --> 24:09.397
Oh, yeah, 'cause you seem
really alive right now.

24:09.431 --> 24:11.399
I'm guessing you haven't been
in therapy before.

24:11.433 --> 24:12.767
No, I'm a surgeon,
and we tend to like to fix things

24:12.785 --> 24:14.101
and not talk about them.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.436
Well, I'm a therapist,

24:15.454 --> 24:18.873
and we like to fix things <i>by</i>
talking about them.

24:19.553 --> 24:21.568
- (singsongy) Don't be scared.
- I'm not scared.

24:21.619 --> 24:24.758
Okay. So all we're gonna do
is talk and try to figure out

24:24.779 --> 24:26.161
if there's anything keeping you here

24:26.206 --> 24:27.053
other than your physical injuries.

24:27.077 --> 24:28.089
- Is that right?
- Sure. Yeah.

24:28.135 --> 24:29.417
- Okay. Ready?
- Yeah.

24:29.451 --> 24:30.785
What is your biggest regret?

24:30.803 --> 24:33.554
I don't believe in regrets.
I have made mistakes.

24:33.589 --> 24:35.139
Okay. So what's your biggest mistake?

24:35.174 --> 24:36.507
I... married the wrong woman.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.976
- Mm.
- But I fixed that. I found the right one.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.978
- And is she waiting for you?
- Yes, she is.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.269
So you have everything
to live for in the physical plane.

24:43.331 --> 24:43.831
Yes.

24:43.841 --> 24:44.929
- But you're stuck here.
- Mm-hmm.

24:44.980 --> 24:45.588
Why?

24:45.623 --> 24:46.601
Traumatic brain injury.

24:46.635 --> 24:50.638
Charlie, you have gotta stop
thinking like a surgeon.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.156
Expand your mind.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.301
Dig deeper.

24:54.438 --> 24:56.994
I'm sorry. I just...
I'm not used to thinking that way.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.312
I just... Not easy.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.314
We're gonna try something
a little different.

25:00.332 --> 25:04.250
Have you ever heard of bioenergetics?

25:04.316 --> 25:04.995
No.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.821
Well, lucky for you, I have.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.206
It's a body-based therapy

25:08.257 --> 25:11.987
designed to help connect
your mind to your body.

25:12.681 --> 25:13.294
- Ready?
- Yeah.

25:14.837 --> 25:15.759
Why are you stuck here?

25:15.789 --> 25:16.464
- What are you doing?
- Why are you stuck here?

25:16.498 --> 25:17.598
Uh, because I'm not a neurologist.

25:17.633 --> 25:19.166
It's not my area of expertise.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.968
That is not an answer.
If you don't wake up, what happens?

25:21.002 --> 25:22.770
Uh, I guess I stay here
until my body dies.

25:22.805 --> 25:24.472
Okay. And how does that make you feel?

25:24.506 --> 25:26.474
- Uh, Kendra...
- Come on, Charlie.

25:26.508 --> 25:27.672
Come on. Say it.

25:27.713 --> 25:28.859
Like, this isn't a life.
Like I... like-like I...

25:28.894 --> 25:31.479
Um, uh, I can't do anything.
I can't even... I can't, uh,

25:31.513 --> 25:32.697
I can't even change these clothes.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.732
Okay, then how does that make you feel?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.784
Scared, okay?! Angry!

25:36.819 --> 25:38.119
Terrified!

25:38.153 --> 25:40.037
- Like I've been cheated.
- Okay.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.123
Okay, like it's a big cosmic joke.

25:42.157 --> 25:43.491
So why won't you wake up?

25:43.525 --> 25:45.660
Because I have a traumatic brain injury.

25:45.694 --> 25:49.997
That is not an answer!
Why won't you wake up?!

25:50.031 --> 25:51.749
- Because.
- Because why?

25:51.800 --> 25:53.167
- Because.
- Tell me why.

25:53.201 --> 25:54.252
- Because...
- Come on. Just say it.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.720
You're on the verge of saying it.

25:55.754 --> 25:57.672
- Why won't you wake up?
- Because I don't wanna wake up!

26:02.092 --> 26:03.043
Makes no sense.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.680
It's okay. It's a feeling.
It doesn't have to make sense.

26:05.714 --> 26:09.550
But, Charlie, some part of
you is keeping you here,

26:09.568 --> 26:11.185
and we need to figure out why.

26:11.219 --> 26:14.405
Is it easier to stay here? Charlie.

26:15.891 --> 26:17.057
Charlie.

26:20.025 --> 26:20.745
I don't know.

26:20.779 --> 26:23.030
You do know. This is your feeling.

26:23.064 --> 26:24.749
Charlie, come on.
Stay with me. Look at me.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.066
Charlie, look at me.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.454
I'm sorry.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.624
This isn't getting me anywhere.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.800
What about that new hockey arena

26:42.851 --> 26:43.968
they're building over in Paisley?

26:44.019 --> 26:46.804
They're using a crane for that?

26:46.855 --> 26:49.295
I've got a woman pinned
under a damn tow truck.

26:49.336 --> 26:50.804
Yes, it's important!

26:50.855 --> 26:52.414
- Mom? Hello?
- It's okay.

26:52.455 --> 26:53.560
- Hello?
- It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

26:53.595 --> 26:54.779
She's losing consciousness. (crying)

26:54.813 --> 26:55.947
- Shock?
- Heart's racing.

26:55.981 --> 26:56.948
She wasn't before. Give me the tubes.

26:56.982 --> 27:00.034
(siren wails)

27:00.068 --> 27:01.285
(crying)

27:01.320 --> 27:03.771
80 palpitations.

27:03.789 --> 27:04.939
Ohh.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.208
- She's bleeding out.
- From where? Not her leg.

27:07.242 --> 27:09.610
Lungs are clear.
It's gotta be in the belly.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.745
(crying)

27:10.779 --> 27:12.546
I mean, an S.G.A. bleed? Broken pelvis.

27:12.581 --> 27:15.583
I'm not gonna know anything
till we get to the O.R.

27:15.617 --> 27:17.251
(whispers) She's dying.

27:17.285 --> 27:18.552
Ronnie, talk to me.

27:18.587 --> 27:20.120
Great. Thanks. We've got a crane,

27:20.138 --> 27:21.923
but it's gonna take 45
minutes to an hour...

27:21.957 --> 27:23.557
- Forty...
- That's too long.

27:23.592 --> 27:26.394
I'm sorry. What can I tell you?
It's the best we've got.

27:26.428 --> 27:27.645
We need to cut her out.

27:27.679 --> 27:29.313
You wanna amputate in the field?

27:29.348 --> 27:31.265
I don't want to, but unless
we get her out from under there,

27:31.299 --> 27:34.235
in the next 15 minutes, she's gonna die.

27:34.269 --> 27:35.469
(siren wailing)

27:35.487 --> 27:37.104
(sobbing)

27:40.166 --> 27:41.936
You wanna amputate her leg with a scalpel,

27:41.967 --> 27:43.278
and you expect me
to get behind that plan? No way.

27:43.298 --> 27:44.250
What's your backup? What's your "B" plan?

27:44.276 --> 27:45.744
I say we keep giving her ringers

27:45.784 --> 27:46.505
until we get the crane set up!

27:46.539 --> 27:47.706
We can't, 'cause she's bleeding out
too fast... We... why don't we try?!

27:47.740 --> 27:48.874
For us to support her. 

27:49.501 --> 27:51.789
- Cut off her leg?
- Because, listen, Ron, it's basic medicine.

27:51.860 --> 27:54.063
- She bleeds out, and she dies.
- Okay, she's not... she's not.

27:54.113 --> 27:55.480
- Okay, listen.
- We save her leg!

27:55.546 --> 27:56.620
What do you want her to do? What?

27:56.731 --> 27:57.779
Listen to me.

27:57.933 --> 27:59.383
Look, I'm not one to back
away from a challenge.

27:59.417 --> 28:01.919
But you know me. What you're
proposing is potentially fatal.

28:01.937 --> 28:03.771
It's okay.

28:03.805 --> 28:04.855
(continues crying)

28:04.890 --> 28:06.107
All right, then that's on me.

28:06.141 --> 28:09.894
I am making this call.

28:09.928 --> 28:11.562
We are doing this.

28:13.615 --> 28:17.034
I've known Stephanie my entire life,

28:17.069 --> 28:19.704
and I am not gonna let her
bleed out from the street.

28:19.738 --> 28:21.038
(siren whoops)

28:21.073 --> 28:22.773
We need to tourniquet that leg.

28:22.791 --> 28:24.208
Get me some clean towels and disinfectant.

28:24.242 --> 28:25.209
This is insane.

28:25.243 --> 28:27.078
It's the plan.

28:27.112 --> 28:29.080
It's gonna be a guillotine operation.

28:29.114 --> 28:30.414
I'll dissect right down to the bone.

28:30.448 --> 28:32.216
Joel, I need you to get
control of all the bleeders.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.884
Ronnie, you need to get them out of here.

28:33.919 --> 28:35.720
- No, I'm not leaving her.
- Okay, shh, shh, shh.

28:35.754 --> 28:37.955
She's out. Airway's secured.

28:37.973 --> 28:40.391
It's running wide open. Betadine.

28:40.425 --> 28:41.592
Tourniquet applied.

28:41.626 --> 28:43.561
Scalpel.

28:43.595 --> 28:46.630
Two fingers from the patella.
Fishmouth incision.

28:46.648 --> 28:51.519
Get those clips ready.
They're gonna be a lot of blood.

28:53.638 --> 28:55.573
Doug.

28:55.607 --> 28:58.075
Where's Richard?

28:58.110 --> 28:59.777
I don't know.

29:03.014 --> 29:04.615
Do you wanna wait for him?

29:06.384 --> 29:08.269
It's not going to be good news, is it?

29:08.303 --> 29:12.039
(sighs) The biopsy results
came back positive

29:12.090 --> 29:16.160
for ductal infiltrating carcinoma,

29:16.178 --> 29:18.462
which is the most common
type of male breast cancer.

29:18.496 --> 29:20.831
Lucky me.

29:20.849 --> 29:22.332
You know, ductal means
that the cancer originated

29:22.350 --> 29:24.385
in the ducts of the breast.

29:24.436 --> 29:27.271
And your tumor is almost
5 centimeters, which is large.

29:27.305 --> 29:28.556
There is also a chance

29:28.607 --> 29:30.224
That it has infiltrated the muscle wall,

29:30.275 --> 29:32.009
which means I'll have to
remove some lymph nodes

29:32.027 --> 29:34.028
to see if the cancer is metastatic.

29:34.062 --> 29:36.180
- And if it is?
- Chemo.

29:36.198 --> 29:39.850
Radiation. But first,
we need to perform a mastectomy.

29:39.868 --> 29:42.403
And then I'll get a breast implant.

29:42.454 --> 29:44.121
You gotta take me from
an "A" cup to a "D"?

29:44.156 --> 29:45.873
I realize that
this is a lot to take in right now...

29:45.907 --> 29:48.242
No, this is ridiculous!

29:52.214 --> 29:54.665
Richard and I were friends for ten years

29:54.699 --> 29:56.433
before we hooked up.

29:56.468 --> 30:00.704
It took 10 years and a 120 pounds.

30:00.722 --> 30:03.007
Then he finally saw me in that way.

30:03.041 --> 30:04.708
And now you want to mutilate me.

30:04.726 --> 30:06.644
Doug, I really think that you...

30:06.678 --> 30:07.995
He will leave me, Dr. Reid.

30:08.029 --> 30:11.899
Maybe not right away, but he will.

30:11.933 --> 30:14.051
Okay, we're down to the femur.

30:14.069 --> 30:15.069
Joel, how do we get through that bone?

30:15.103 --> 30:16.353
Saw's on its way from the hospital.

30:16.387 --> 30:18.155
On its way?

30:18.190 --> 30:19.573
Yeah. They say it's gonna
be here in ten minutes.

30:19.608 --> 30:21.826
I am not losing my patient
because of a damn saw.

30:21.860 --> 30:24.061
Joel, you're the orthopod.
Find something else.

30:26.915 --> 30:29.917
(monitor beeping steadily)

30:34.289 --> 30:35.422
Knife.

30:43.632 --> 30:45.216
Those are bolt cutters.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.267
Yeah.

30:46.301 --> 30:49.353
Okay. Let's do this.

30:49.387 --> 30:50.587
Okay, hit me with the betadine.

30:52.641 --> 30:53.941
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

30:53.975 --> 30:55.759
(whispers) Okay. (clank)

30:58.096 --> 31:00.364
Okay, I'm holding 'em back.

31:00.398 --> 31:02.233

31:02.267 --> 31:03.617
Joel.

31:03.652 --> 31:05.653
Yeah. Whatever's going
through your head right now,

31:05.704 --> 31:07.571
you just let it go.

31:07.605 --> 31:11.242
All right, you breathe in.
Breathe out. Make the cut.

31:11.276 --> 31:12.409

31:12.443 --> 31:13.544

31:22.087 --> 31:23.954
(exhales deeply)

31:23.972 --> 31:25.673
Get her to the ambulance.

31:27.092 --> 31:28.559
Don't worry about the stump, Ron.

31:28.593 --> 31:30.010
Find the source of bleeding
and stop it, right?

31:30.061 --> 31:31.478
Do you need us in the O.R.?

31:31.513 --> 31:33.630
- I've got it. Dr. Kinney?
- Yeah.

31:33.648 --> 31:34.765
Thank you.

31:34.799 --> 31:36.967
- Yeah, just go.
- Will do.

31:39.521 --> 31:42.806
That's great. Thank you, Ronnie.
(darts thudding)

31:42.824 --> 31:44.975
Okay, I'll call back later. Okay.

31:44.993 --> 31:46.977
- Good news?
- Great news. She's gonna be okay.

31:46.995 --> 31:48.478
Oh, that's amazing.

a scalpel and bolt cutters.

32:07.616 --> 32:10.834
I need about nine more drinks.

32:19.194 --> 32:21.028

32:21.062 --> 32:23.814
(thud) Just went back to surgery too soon.

32:23.848 --> 32:26.683
Come on. It wasn't about your hand.
Your hand was fine.

32:26.701 --> 32:27.985
You just couldn't make the cut.

you castrated that poor Ronnie guy.

You know what? That, what you just said...

That's the whole problem.

I mean, so when men aren't ignoring us,

33:09.110 --> 33:10.194
- they're demonizing us.
- Okay, I think you're being a little...

33:10.228 --> 33:13.130
I've known Stephanie since I was 7.

33:13.164 --> 33:16.333
Right? 7. And she's lying there,
bleeding to death on the street,

33:16.368 --> 33:19.069
and no one's willing to
make a tough call except me.

33:19.087 --> 33:21.405
And all I'm thinking about
when I'm cutting off her leg

33:21.423 --> 33:24.574
is I said I'd call her today,
but I probably wouldn't have.

33:24.592 --> 33:26.460

35:25.046 --> 35:27.581
How are you feeling?

35:27.616 --> 35:29.833
Groggy.

35:29.868 --> 35:32.252
It'll pass.

35:32.287 --> 35:35.189
Time for me to check the incision, okay?

35:35.223 --> 35:37.341
- Just gonna move your arm out.
- Mm.

35:37.375 --> 35:39.242
- Is that all right?
- Mm-hmm.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.418
- No. I don't want him to see it.
- Okay.

35:48.436 --> 35:49.553
Why? You think I'm gonna leave you?

35:55.977 --> 35:57.444
I don't want you to pity me.

35:57.479 --> 35:59.613
I don't.

35:59.648 --> 36:00.931
I love you.

36:17.132 --> 36:18.448
(sniffles)

36:23.088 --> 36:24.672
Here we go.

36:28.843 --> 36:30.094
The incision looks good.

36:30.128 --> 36:32.295
No sign of infection.

36:34.349 --> 36:36.233
I'll be back to check on you. Just rest.

36:36.267 --> 36:37.634
(whispers) Thank you.

36:43.525 --> 36:44.758
It's okay.

36:44.793 --> 36:48.028
I love you.

36:53.585 --> 36:55.869
Let me guess. Surgical lube?

36:55.920 --> 36:58.155
In both my shoes.

36:58.173 --> 37:00.090
Well, they hate me.

37:00.125 --> 37:02.826
No, they just...

37:02.844 --> 37:04.011
Do you want the truth?

37:04.045 --> 37:05.763
Sure.

37:05.797 --> 37:09.216
You're their boss.

37:09.267 --> 37:10.684
And you're laying that on a little heavy.

37:10.719 --> 37:13.303
Mm.

37:13.337 --> 37:14.504
So I should be nicer.

37:14.522 --> 37:15.989
Yes.

37:16.024 --> 37:18.609
I mean, they're still gonna
hate you sometimes, but...

37:18.643 --> 37:21.178
That's why you're so relaxed, huh?

37:21.196 --> 37:24.982
Partly. It's lonely at the top.

37:25.016 --> 37:26.483
But if you wanna buy me a coffee,

37:26.517 --> 37:29.686
I might impart all of
my chief resident wisdom to you.

37:29.704 --> 37:30.871
Does that mean you don't
want the job back?

37:30.905 --> 37:32.790
I didn't say that.

37:32.824 --> 37:34.825
(door closes)

37:34.859 --> 37:36.493
Hey.

37:36.528 --> 37:37.494
Hey.

37:37.528 --> 37:38.862
How was your field trip?

37:38.880 --> 37:42.466
I cut off a woman's leg
with a pair of bolt cutters.

37:42.500 --> 37:45.535
Huh. Liar.

37:46.554 --> 37:47.838
See ya.

37:52.227 --> 37:54.812
Ah, there she is.

37:54.846 --> 37:57.547
So where's that application?
Job posting's up.

37:57.565 --> 37:59.850
- I'm not applying.
- Sorry?

37:59.884 --> 38:02.269
(chuckles) I'm not
submitting an application

38:02.320 --> 38:04.554
for a job I'm already doing...

38:04.572 --> 38:05.856
and doing extremely well.

38:05.890 --> 38:08.742
Uh, Dana, there's a process.

38:08.777 --> 38:10.994
Right. And this is mine.
I've worked my ass off

38:11.029 --> 38:13.197
for the past 15 years at this hospital,

38:13.231 --> 38:16.366
the past three months as
interim chief of surgery.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.918
That's my application.

38:17.952 --> 38:19.870
That's my process.

38:19.904 --> 38:21.738
And if that doesn't work for you,

38:21.756 --> 38:23.740
good luck finding someone to replace me.

38:32.433 --> 38:34.885
And <i>that's</i> that.

38:34.919 --> 38:38.355
Yeah. I'm sorry, Kendra.

38:38.389 --> 38:40.023
Wow.

38:40.058 --> 38:41.424
This sucks.

38:41.442 --> 38:44.978
I'm not even gonna try to
be philosophical about it.

38:45.029 --> 38:49.266
So you ready to move on, or...

38:49.284 --> 38:51.985
Actually, no, I have
some unresolved business

38:52.036 --> 38:54.288
I need to attend to.

38:54.322 --> 38:56.573
(sighs)

38:56.607 --> 38:58.292
<i>Charlie. (groans)</i>

38:58.326 --> 38:59.442
Come <i>on.</i>

38:59.460 --> 39:00.944
Please?

39:00.962 --> 39:05.048
Oh, god. You want me
to jump up on the slab?

39:05.083 --> 39:06.717
If that makes you more comfortable.

39:06.751 --> 39:09.419
(sighs)

39:09.453 --> 39:10.971
- Charlie.
- Hmm?

39:11.005 --> 39:12.206
Why don't you wanna wake up?

39:12.240 --> 39:14.291
(sighs) You know, that's the thing.

39:14.309 --> 39:16.393
'Cause I want that more than anything.

39:16.427 --> 39:18.011
So then what's stopping you?

39:19.397 --> 39:20.480
What are you afraid of?

39:20.515 --> 39:24.084
What's the source of all this pain?

39:29.757 --> 39:32.910
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.

39:37.115 --> 39:38.982
You're not gonna lose me.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.367
I'm not going anywhere.

39:40.418 --> 39:42.886
You can't promise that.

39:44.272 --> 39:46.356
Nobody can promise that.

39:47.675 --> 39:50.177
Fine.

39:50.211 --> 39:52.763
You're older than me.

39:52.797 --> 39:53.964
You'll die before I do.

39:53.998 --> 39:56.300
(laughs)

39:56.334 --> 39:57.334
That make you feel better?

39:57.352 --> 39:58.602
Yes, it does. Thank you.

39:58.636 --> 39:59.887
I'll pine for you.

39:59.938 --> 40:01.939
(laughs)

40:01.973 --> 40:07.144
You know my parents died
when I was 6, right?

40:07.178 --> 40:10.097
It was a car accident.

40:13.151 --> 40:15.335
They, um...

40:15.370 --> 40:18.322
they came into my room...

40:18.356 --> 40:20.691
and they put me to bed...

40:20.725 --> 40:27.447
and they kissed me good night.

40:27.482 --> 40:29.016
And then my aunt came in the next morning

40:29.050 --> 40:32.202
and... she told me that they were gone.

40:32.236 --> 40:35.322
But after that, I shut down.

40:35.356 --> 40:39.776
I didn't say one word to
anybody for a whole year.

40:41.946 --> 40:44.865
Charlie, your heart is pounding.

40:46.734 --> 40:50.454
I am not going anywhere.

41:01.082 --> 41:03.533
Charlie, I am not a neurologist.

41:03.551 --> 41:06.553
I don't know how comas work,

41:06.587 --> 41:10.891
but I do know how the human mind works.

41:10.925 --> 41:14.227
This is your mind's home turf.

41:14.262 --> 41:16.046
If it doesn't want you to wake up,

41:16.064 --> 41:19.766
then you need to fight it,
and you need to figure out why,

41:19.817 --> 41:22.819
and once you get
the answer to that question,

41:22.854 --> 41:25.856
you're gonna be one giant
step closer to going home.

41:29.527 --> 41:31.227
How do I do that?

41:31.245 --> 41:36.566
You gotta... open up.

41:36.584 --> 41:37.918
Be brave.

41:37.952 --> 41:40.037
Look at the parts of
you that you've hidden

41:40.071 --> 41:41.788
in order to protect yourself.

41:44.042 --> 41:46.109
You're no hack, Kendra.

41:46.144 --> 41:48.745
- Really?
- (sucks teeth) Yeah.

41:50.214 --> 41:53.450
Yeah. You helped me.

41:55.770 --> 41:58.221
