[police siren wails]

00:13.599 --> 00:16.878
[mutters incoherently]

00:25.784 --> 00:27.372
- [Nurse] Dr. Nesbitt
to admitting.

00:28.235 --> 00:30.237
Dr. Nesbitt to admitting,
please.

00:30.789 --> 00:33.654
[Jennifer mutters]

00:41.006 --> 00:43.043
- Good morning, Jennifer.

00:45.010 --> 00:46.046
How we feeling today?

00:56.194 --> 00:59.059
[Jennifer whimpers]

01:06.618 --> 01:10.242
Patient Jennifer McCray's
behavior has not changed.

01:10.932 --> 01:13.073
Patient is still delusional.

01:14.350 --> 01:17.111
Symptoms have worsened since
previous episodes.

01:18.561 --> 01:21.736
Still no information on what
happened at the house.

01:22.323 --> 01:23.462
- You believe me, right?

01:24.084 --> 01:24.739
You believe me, right?

01:25.568 --> 01:27.639
The house, you believe me,
right?

01:28.226 --> 01:28.536
You believe me, right?

01:29.399 --> 01:30.124
- There is nothing,
nothing wrong

01:31.021 --> 01:32.161
with the house, Jennifer,
nothing.

01:32.782 --> 01:34.370
It's all in your head.

01:35.543 --> 01:36.579
The sooner that you
understand that,

01:37.235 --> 01:38.305
the sooner you'll do better.

01:39.340 --> 01:43.275
And then we can talk about
what really happened.

01:43.931 --> 01:45.484
Don't you agree, Jennifer?

01:45.967 --> 01:48.660
[thunder cracks]

01:51.420 --> 01:52.181
Oh!

01:53.251 --> 01:55.045
God, what are you doing?

01:56.668 --> 01:57.703
What are you doing?

01:58.463 --> 01:59.878
- What are you doing, Jennifer?

02:00.223 --> 02:01.638
[screams]

02:02.260 --> 02:03.744
What are you doing to me?

02:04.952 --> 02:07.127

02:08.335 --> 02:10.301
[yelps]

02:13.512 --> 02:16.722
[mutters incoherently]

02:31.289 --> 02:33.256
[cries]

02:38.088 --> 02:40.574
- [Nurse] Dr. Gray, please call
the security office.

02:41.091 --> 02:41.575
- Anything new?

02:42.231 --> 02:43.128
- No, there's nothing new.

02:44.025 --> 02:45.958
She's still completely
unresponsive.

02:47.442 --> 02:51.343
As a matter of fact, I hate to
say it, but I think she's,

02:52.517 --> 02:54.174
she may have gotten worse.

02:56.555 --> 02:58.178
- No, no, no, no, no.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.181
Get back!

03:01.664 --> 03:02.734
They're here!

03:05.530 --> 03:07.842
- Is she worse than
she was after,

03:09.637 --> 03:11.052
after what her mother did?

03:17.887 --> 03:19.785
[sobs]

03:20.269 --> 03:20.716
- Don't look.

03:21.373 --> 03:22.581
- One thing is for certain.

03:23.444 --> 03:25.722
The medication that was
working then,

03:26.792 --> 03:28.242
it's not working at all now.

03:29.174 --> 03:31.452
- [Nurse] Dr. Nesbitt
to admitting.

03:32.626 --> 03:35.111
Dr. Nesbitt to admitting,
please.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.803
- So what are we
supposed to do now?

03:39.149 --> 03:41.324
I mean, first Brian,
and now this.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.569
- [Nurse] Housekeeping
on floor three.

03:45.432 --> 03:47.503
- I wasn't even
supposed to be...

03:48.814 --> 03:51.645
I'm not even supposed to be
in this position.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.373
- Chris, I'm sorry.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.859
We're gonna handle this, okay?

04:00.136 --> 04:00.999
We've handled it before.

04:01.862 --> 04:03.795
We're gonna do it again,
I promise you.

04:05.452 --> 04:09.076
Chris, this is not your fault.

04:09.421 --> 04:10.250
It's not.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.460
Okay? - Okay, okay.

04:18.084 --> 04:18.913
Okay.

04:22.469 --> 04:26.127
So what's the next step?

04:27.612 --> 04:29.855
- [Nurse] Dr. Gray, please call
the security office.

04:30.235 --> 04:31.063
- Well.

04:32.651 --> 04:34.619
I think we should increase
her dosage and see.

04:35.102 --> 04:36.172
It might help.

04:37.346 --> 04:39.106
If not, then there's a
couple of ideas.

04:39.624 --> 04:42.592
[Jennifer mutters]

04:43.041 --> 04:43.352
- Get back!

04:43.869 --> 04:44.387
- Did you look?

04:44.939 --> 04:45.526
I told you not to.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.390
[whimpers]

04:47.804 --> 04:50.048
[rattling]

05:02.267 --> 05:03.648
- No, no, no, no!

05:04.856 --> 05:07.099
[gun fires] [screams]

05:07.583 --> 05:10.275
[ominous music]

[flies buzzing]

07:52.368 --> 07:54.439
[knocks]

07:56.234 --> 07:57.062
- Hello?

07:57.925 --> 07:59.824
- Hello. [Jennifer yelps]

08:00.756 --> 08:02.654
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

08:03.552 --> 08:04.829
- It's okay, are you
the landlord?

08:05.208 --> 08:05.657
- Yeah.

08:06.140 --> 08:07.901
Look, I'm sorry.

08:08.453 --> 08:09.661
Steve. - Jennifer.

08:10.559 --> 08:11.974
- Jennifer, it's good
to meet you.

08:14.114 --> 08:16.392
I'm sorry to have to contact you
under these circumstances,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.395
but my guy came out to do
some electrical work,

08:20.120 --> 08:24.089
and, well, he noticed the smell.

08:24.987 --> 08:25.470
Gave me a call, and
when I went in,

08:26.540 --> 08:27.645
it looked like the place could
have been abandoned

08:28.335 --> 08:29.716
for a couple of months now.

08:30.924 --> 08:32.753
Anyway, you were the only
emergency contact

08:33.270 --> 08:34.721
on Brian's sheet.

08:35.376 --> 08:36.688
- Just me, nobody else?

08:37.275 --> 08:38.241
- [Steve] Just you.

08:39.104 --> 08:39.553
- Huh.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.761
Why did it take you so
long to notice?

08:42.625 --> 08:43.730
- I mean, I own the place, yeah,
sure,

08:44.627 --> 08:46.180
but I got other things going,
right?

08:47.043 --> 08:47.975
And for the most part,
these kids,

08:48.976 --> 08:50.150
as long as they don't burn
the place down,

08:50.771 --> 08:52.462
I feel lucky, you know?

08:53.325 --> 08:53.705
And these work-study kids,

08:54.913 --> 08:58.020
most of them pay their entire
lease all at once up front.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.194
So, you know.

09:01.402 --> 09:04.440
Didn't Brian tell you
about the grant?

09:06.131 --> 09:07.650
- No, he didn't mention a grant,

09:08.548 --> 09:11.551
but that would make sense,
though.

09:13.345 --> 09:17.108
- Anyway, I left everything
pretty much as it was,

09:18.281 --> 09:21.630
except for some minor remodeling
that I'm doing in there.

09:22.872 --> 09:23.977
Don't be alarmed, all right?

09:24.391 --> 09:25.219
- Alarmed?

09:27.256 --> 09:28.602
- You'll see when we go in.

09:32.779 --> 09:35.436
[flies buzzing]

09:39.130 --> 09:39.924
Told you.

09:47.000 --> 09:47.828
Could...

09:49.761 --> 09:51.280
Could Brian have been on drugs?

09:52.177 --> 09:53.351
- Not that I know of.

09:54.766 --> 09:57.631
This isn't like him, even if he
does live with other people.

09:59.046 --> 09:59.288
And speaking of other people,

10:00.289 --> 10:02.153
what are you gonna do with
all their stuff?

10:04.258 --> 10:07.572
- Well, I contacted their folks.

10:08.746 --> 10:10.299
Nobody's gotten back in
touch with me.

10:11.369 --> 10:12.266
You're the first.

10:14.786 --> 10:17.617
As far as their stuff, I do have
to make my money back,

10:18.272 --> 10:19.619
just like everybody else.

10:21.379 --> 10:22.863
- Guess I can understand that.

10:29.525 --> 10:31.596
Is it okay if I look
around a little bit?

10:37.395 --> 10:38.223
- Sure.

10:38.776 --> 10:39.811
I'll just watch TV.

10:42.089 --> 10:42.883
- Okay.

10:56.517 --> 10:58.002
- [Woman] Come here and help me.

10:59.417 --> 11:01.833
Now grab hold of that and pull.

11:04.525 --> 11:05.975
- [Man] I love you.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.770
Katie's here.

11:08.219 --> 11:09.047
She's here.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.361
That's not her.

11:13.224 --> 11:15.053
Let's do it where she
wants to be.

11:17.538 --> 11:18.781
Look over here.

11:20.196 --> 11:23.372
[television chatters]

11:48.328 --> 11:51.193
[foreboding music]

11:53.782 --> 11:55.507
- Jenn, if you find this,
please leave now.

11:56.474 --> 11:57.578
If you can't leave,
you'll get trapped!

11:58.545 --> 11:59.995
Here are the instructions. - No,
no, no, no.

12:00.650 --> 12:01.410
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:02.066 --> 12:04.344
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.695
[beeping]

12:16.321 --> 12:17.426
[rumbling]

12:17.875 --> 12:19.014
What the hell?

12:19.393 --> 12:21.568
[banging]

12:27.091 --> 12:29.749
[ominous music]

12:52.047 --> 12:52.495
Hm.

12:53.013 --> 12:55.878
[foreboding music]

13:57.733 --> 14:00.287
[woman shouts]

14:02.186 --> 14:02.531
- Hey, what's wrong?

14:03.394 --> 14:04.740
- Mom and Dad are
fighting again.

14:05.396 --> 14:06.811
I just don't like listening.

14:08.123 --> 14:09.400
It's really bad this time.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.995
- Hey, what do you say we go
and throw some ball?

14:18.858 --> 14:19.168
- I was gonna play
my video game,

14:19.893 --> 14:21.791
but if you really want me to.

14:22.516 --> 14:24.173
- Come on, Sis, just you and me.

14:31.146 --> 14:33.803
[ominous music]

14:35.529 --> 14:38.187
[parents shout]

14:44.262 --> 14:45.125
- Don't look.

14:45.574 --> 14:47.887
[gun fires]

15:00.416 --> 15:00.830
[door creaks]

15:01.901 --> 15:04.386
- Oh, I'm sorry, I was just
finishing up in here.

15:06.353 --> 15:06.698
Do you need something?

15:07.907 --> 15:11.186
- Well, I'm actually trying to
get out of here for the day.

15:12.981 --> 15:15.259
So if you could maybe come back
in a couple of days

15:16.329 --> 15:18.503
to get the rest of his things,
that'd be great.

15:19.608 --> 15:22.300
- Well, hopefully by then I
would've heard from him.

15:24.406 --> 15:25.786
- One can only hope.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.479
And who knows, I mean,
these kids,

15:29.411 --> 15:31.068
they get overseas
offers all the time.

15:32.138 --> 15:35.313
I mean, maybe Brian got one and
just jumped on it.

15:36.832 --> 15:40.077
- I mean, it's not like him to
just leave all of his crap.

15:45.082 --> 15:47.981
[unsettling music]

15:52.572 --> 15:54.746
- There once was a deer
in the forest.

15:55.368 --> 15:56.334
Summer was very, very hot,

15:57.335 --> 15:59.820
and in the heat, the deer
became very thirsty.

16:00.338 --> 16:00.821
[unsettling music]

16:01.926 --> 16:04.411
He found a small spring and
decided to take a drink.

16:05.274 --> 16:05.930
He noticed his
reflection in the water,

16:07.104 --> 16:10.348
and greatly admired the size and
the shape of his antlers.

16:11.832 --> 16:15.526
They were vast and ornate, and
oh so very pointed.

16:20.186 --> 16:21.773
- Jennifer. - Brian?

16:22.809 --> 16:24.397
- Jennifer. - Brian,
is that you?

16:25.846 --> 16:26.847
- As the deer contemplated
himself in the spring,

16:27.365 --> 16:28.677
a lion approached.

16:29.367 --> 16:30.196
Seeing the deer so distracted,

16:31.197 --> 16:33.337
the lion crouched to
spring upon the deer.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.754
The deer sensed the lion
immediately and took flight.

16:37.444 --> 16:38.100
The deer was very fast indeed,

16:39.170 --> 16:42.622
and as long as the path
remained smooth and open,

16:43.968 --> 16:44.727
he remained a safe distance
away from the lion.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.145
- Brian, where have you been,
what are you doing?

16:48.628 --> 16:51.010
[tense music]

16:51.424 --> 16:52.011
- Go back.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.325
Don't come back to this house,
Jennifer!

16:58.776 --> 17:00.778
Go back!

17:02.193 --> 17:03.022
- Brian!

17:04.057 --> 17:04.989
Brian!

17:05.438 --> 17:07.715
Brian, Brian!

17:09.787 --> 17:10.615
Brian!

17:15.205 --> 17:17.346
[roaring]

17:18.623 --> 17:19.797
Brian, please!

17:36.607 --> 17:37.435
Brian?

17:50.138 --> 17:51.277
What the hell?

18:01.873 --> 18:03.427
Brian, is that you?

18:07.776 --> 18:10.089
Brian, what are you doing,
stop fooling around.

18:10.572 --> 18:12.091
- Come on, Sis.

18:12.643 --> 18:13.264
We can play catch.

18:13.954 --> 18:15.473
- No, no, no, can't be real.

18:16.164 --> 18:17.820
- Just you and me. - Brian.

18:18.304 --> 18:18.649
- Like old times.

18:19.167 --> 18:20.202
- Not real, stop.

18:20.858 --> 18:22.066
Not real, not real, no.

18:22.825 --> 18:23.792
This isn't real,
this isn't real.

18:24.551 --> 18:25.518
This isn't real,
this isn't real.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.520
It's not real, stop.

18:28.590 --> 18:30.592
Shut up, make it stop. - Now
what's wrong, Sis?

18:31.213 --> 18:31.524
- [Jennifer] Make it stop.

18:32.766 --> 18:34.492
- I told you not to come back
here, but you wouldn't listen.

18:35.183 --> 18:35.597
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

18:36.494 --> 18:38.013
- Just like Mother told
you not to look.

18:38.634 --> 18:39.187
- [Jennifer] Make it stop.

18:39.808 --> 18:40.843
- But you looked anyway.

18:41.465 --> 18:42.121
- Make it stop, fuck you.

18:43.191 --> 18:45.676
- Now since you're here, we can
play catch, right?

18:46.849 --> 18:47.126
Right?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.163
- Fuck you, fuck you! -
Just like old times!

18:51.371 --> 18:53.580
Now Jennifer, you know
what Daddy would do

18:54.236 --> 18:55.720
if you didn't listen to him.

19:00.104 --> 19:03.245
But since he's dead, I'm gonna
cut you some slack.

19:06.800 --> 19:11.046
Now, come on over here and give
your big brother a hug.

19:22.022 --> 19:24.024
[suspenseful music]

19:24.715 --> 19:25.681
Jennifer, please listen to me!

19:26.337 --> 19:27.131
Don't, don't come back here!

19:27.821 --> 19:28.581
Please, promise me you won't!

19:29.582 --> 19:30.721
- No, no, no, no-- -
Promise me you won't!

19:31.308 --> 19:32.895
Jennifer, promise me!

19:33.241 --> 19:34.380
[shouts]

19:34.863 --> 19:35.174
- No! - Promise!

19:36.209 --> 19:38.315
Promise me you won't,
promise me you won't!

19:38.660 --> 19:40.765
[shouts]

19:42.905 --> 19:43.734
Jennifer!

19:44.562 --> 19:45.391
- No!

19:46.564 --> 19:48.359
Brian, I love you too!

19:52.605 --> 19:55.366
[phone vibrates]

20:04.099 --> 20:06.860
Oh shit, forgot to
call her back.

20:14.351 --> 20:15.248
- [Christine] Hi, Jennifer,
it's me.

20:16.284 --> 20:18.355
I know you probably had a
really rough day,

20:19.287 --> 20:19.977
and I probably
shouldn't have let you

20:20.633 --> 20:22.393
go to the house by yourself.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.154
But just call me back
when you get this.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.606
I wanted to know what the status
was on your brother.

20:29.055 --> 20:29.952
I love you.

20:33.749 --> 20:34.509
- [Brian] Help me, Jen.

20:35.234 --> 20:35.613
- No, no, no, no! - Help me!

20:36.235 --> 20:38.029
Please, I can't leave!

20:38.513 --> 20:41.170
[Brian screams]

20:45.830 --> 20:47.625
[roaring]

20:48.005 --> 20:48.281
Jennifer!

20:48.833 --> 20:51.733
[dial tone blares]

20:57.325 --> 20:58.843
- Jennifer, it's me again.

20:59.706 --> 21:00.431
Please call me back soon,
sweetie.

21:01.190 --> 21:03.434
I am really worried about Brian.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.473
And I just want you to know that

21:09.268 --> 21:12.340
I know we've had our
differences, but I love you,

21:13.099 --> 21:15.170
and you both mean so much to me.

21:16.930 --> 21:19.070
So just call when you can, okay,
honey?

21:22.039 --> 21:24.593
[solemn music]

21:34.293 --> 21:36.778
[phone rings]

21:43.336 --> 21:44.130
Jenn.

21:44.648 --> 21:45.718
- Hey, Aunt Chris.

21:46.891 --> 21:47.823
I'm sorry for calling
you so late.

21:48.859 --> 21:51.310
I just went to Brian's and
then I passed out.

21:51.758 --> 21:52.518
- It's okay.

21:53.139 --> 21:53.726
Have you heard anything?

21:54.658 --> 21:57.177
- No, that's what I
don't understand.

21:58.213 --> 21:59.352
I mean, he at least would
have packed a bag

22:00.042 --> 22:01.527
or taken some of his stuff.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.323
Especially if he was gonna
go for this long.

22:05.047 --> 22:06.877
- Well, you know, maybe he just,

22:07.947 --> 22:09.328
he got called out and he just
didn't have a chance

22:09.845 --> 22:10.018
to pack anything.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.883
- But he never would've left
without calling me.

22:13.780 --> 22:14.816
He's never left without
saying goodbye.

22:15.644 --> 22:18.267
- Yeah, but he was
really pissed.

22:18.992 --> 22:20.960
- Yeah, but more at you than me.

22:23.238 --> 22:25.827
- Look, Jen, we've
been over this.

22:27.035 --> 22:28.692
There is no way I could
have afforded

22:29.382 --> 22:30.970
to loan him that much money.

22:31.557 --> 22:31.798
And neither could you.

22:32.420 --> 22:33.524
- You could have co...

22:34.836 --> 22:36.493
You could have co-signed on a
loan or something.

22:37.114 --> 22:37.666
- No, I couldn't have.

22:38.771 --> 22:41.532
I would've liked to, but it
doesn't work like that.

22:42.464 --> 22:44.328
It is more complicated
than you think.

22:45.053 --> 22:47.331
- Then who was supposed to, who?

22:47.918 --> 22:49.126
Our parents are dead!

22:50.334 --> 22:53.130
You willingly took this on, but
you weren't willing to...

23:01.759 --> 23:02.588
I'm sorry.

23:07.109 --> 23:07.938
Sorry.

23:10.699 --> 23:11.873
That's not true.

23:14.082 --> 23:17.188
You took us in after all of
those years, after Mom and Dad.

23:19.812 --> 23:22.435
I'm sorry, this is just too much
to handle right now.

23:25.611 --> 23:29.166
Anyway, the landlord said that
he got a study grant.

23:29.718 --> 23:31.168
- Well, that's good.

23:34.930 --> 23:39.901
Look, Jen, I know that you and
your brother were,

23:40.660 --> 23:41.868
are really close.

23:43.870 --> 23:45.803
Especially since

23:47.115 --> 23:48.392
your whore mother

23:50.601 --> 23:53.880
killed my brother in cold blood!

23:54.329 --> 23:54.881
[gun fires]

23:55.503 --> 23:57.125
So brother for brother!

23:58.540 --> 23:59.955
Think the scales are even now,
don't you think?

24:00.404 --> 24:01.578
[gun cocks]

24:02.510 --> 24:05.236
Especially since your
parents died.

24:07.066 --> 24:08.861
We just need to stay positive.

24:09.758 --> 24:10.069
Your brother is fine.

24:10.759 --> 24:13.244
He was mad at the both of us,

24:14.314 --> 24:17.283
and he just left on a trip
without letting us know.

24:18.526 --> 24:20.769
- Have you talked to Dr.
Katja lately?

24:21.701 --> 24:23.703
- No, why?

24:25.360 --> 24:27.396
- Because I keep seeing
all these things,

24:28.156 --> 24:30.330
hearing all these weird things.

24:32.712 --> 24:33.575
- Like what, baby?

24:35.508 --> 24:36.682
- Think I just keep having all
of these dreams about Brian,

24:37.821 --> 24:40.409
and they're not dreams, they're
more like nightmares.

24:45.414 --> 24:48.935
- Well, it's probably the
stress of the situation.

24:49.591 --> 24:50.799
Are you still on your meds?

24:51.144 --> 24:51.973
- Yes.

24:53.215 --> 24:54.389
But it's different.

24:55.528 --> 24:56.322
It's more real, it's not
like it was before.

24:57.185 --> 24:58.600
Like today, when I
was at Brian's.

24:59.532 --> 25:02.017
- Sweetie, your
brother is missing,

25:03.260 --> 25:06.297
and it's affecting you deeply,
as it should.

25:07.678 --> 25:09.473
You need to relax,
get some rest.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.614
Everything's gonna be find,
we're gonna find him.

25:19.966 --> 25:21.174
Maybe you're right, Aunt Chris.

25:22.072 --> 25:22.900
I don't know, it just
doesn't feel--

25:23.383 --> 25:24.350
- Now look, Jen.

25:24.937 --> 25:27.042
Get some rest now, okay?

25:28.319 --> 25:29.907
And I will talk to you tomorrow.

25:31.633 --> 25:32.220
And if you're still
having a rough time,

25:32.979 --> 25:34.533
we'll go and talk to Dr. Katja.

25:35.810 --> 25:36.638
Okay?

25:39.365 --> 25:40.159
I love you.

25:42.679 --> 25:42.955
- I love you.

25:44.163 --> 25:46.165
- [Christine] And call me if
there's any other news, okay?

25:48.098 --> 25:49.651
- Yes, ma'am. - Bye.

25:51.308 --> 25:52.309
- Yeah, bye.

26:13.399 --> 26:16.126
[phone vibrates]

26:20.924 --> 26:23.512
[gentle music]

26:24.513 --> 26:25.135
- [Waitress] Hi, how's it going?

26:25.653 --> 26:26.032
- Hey, what's up?

26:26.723 --> 26:27.240
- I'll be your waitress today.

26:28.172 --> 26:29.760
Can I start you off with
anything to drink?

26:30.243 --> 26:31.003
- Yes, please.

26:31.486 --> 26:32.211
Got some pop?

26:33.039 --> 26:33.833
- Yeah. - Tell you what,
let me just,

26:34.523 --> 26:34.731
let me just have some water.

26:35.766 --> 26:37.112
- Water, okay, I'll be
right back with that.

26:37.492 --> 26:38.320
- Okay.

26:45.673 --> 26:47.606
Hey, beautiful, how you doing?

26:48.089 --> 26:49.124
- Feel like hell.

26:49.538 --> 26:50.712
[chuckles]

26:51.333 --> 26:51.575
- Well, you look it too.

26:52.162 --> 26:53.715
- Always have the jokes.

26:57.788 --> 27:00.101
I'm doing all right for
the circumstances.

27:01.067 --> 27:03.000
- I knew by your tone
something was up.

27:04.450 --> 27:07.004
He's probably just in Peru
checking things out.

27:11.181 --> 27:13.010
- Don't you think he would've
told you that, though?

27:13.977 --> 27:14.253
- You know as well as I do

27:15.185 --> 27:15.944
Brian forgets the most
mundane things,

27:16.876 --> 27:17.636
like brushing his teeth
and eating dinner

27:18.740 --> 27:20.397
and telling people he's fled the
country for a month.

27:20.846 --> 27:21.674
- That's true.

27:22.261 --> 27:22.641
- Here's your water.

27:23.296 --> 27:24.159
Hi, welcome to Sunny's.

27:25.022 --> 27:26.368
Can I get you
something to drink?

27:26.817 --> 27:27.197
- Water, please.

27:28.060 --> 27:29.130
- [Waitress] Okay, I'll
be right back.

27:33.513 --> 27:34.514
- Thank you.

27:37.448 --> 27:40.831
I think there's something really
wrong with Brian, Ken.

27:41.211 --> 27:42.039
- Like?

27:43.282 --> 27:46.112
- I keep having these
crazy dreams

27:47.182 --> 27:49.598
where he's telling me not to go
back to the house.

27:50.461 --> 27:51.152
- [Kenneth] Wait,
your old house?

27:51.842 --> 27:52.256
Why would you even consider--

27:53.085 --> 27:54.569
- No, no, not our parents'
house,

27:55.328 --> 27:56.882
the house where he was staying.

27:58.262 --> 28:00.299
And it always ends the same.

28:00.817 --> 28:01.956
- How does it end?

28:02.853 --> 28:05.407
- He dies, if you can
call it that.

28:07.064 --> 28:08.617
- What do you mean?

28:11.275 --> 28:13.381
- Something grabs him.

28:14.451 --> 28:15.314
I know this sounds crazy.

28:15.935 --> 28:16.625
- Here's your other water.

28:16.971 --> 28:17.488
- Thanks.

28:18.455 --> 28:19.559
- Do y'all wanna order
something to eat?

28:20.181 --> 28:20.560
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.529
- Come on, you're gonna let a
hungry man eat by himself?

28:23.840 --> 28:24.081
- Pizza?

28:25.013 --> 28:26.359
- I'll just have
whatever he's having.

28:26.946 --> 28:27.395
- Two veggies please.

28:28.430 --> 28:28.741
- All right, I'll have that
right out for y'all.

28:29.190 --> 28:30.018
- Thank you.

28:32.711 --> 28:36.956
Look, Jen, are you sure it
isn't just stress?

28:37.577 --> 28:38.889
- What hallucinations?

28:40.270 --> 28:42.237
- I'm telling you
something's really wrong!

28:43.273 --> 28:44.101
- Look, just calm down.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.828
All right, I'm worried
about him too.

28:48.657 --> 28:50.452
He's like a brother to me.

28:55.043 --> 28:58.909
- Yesterday, when I was at his
house packing up his stuff,

29:00.359 --> 29:03.017
I could've swore I saw him
standing there, reaching out,

29:03.638 --> 29:05.467
and saying, "Help me."

29:11.335 --> 29:12.543
- You still taking those?

29:13.303 --> 29:14.822
- Yeah, they help keep me calm.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.688
- Look, Jen, I don't know what
you want me to do.

29:21.449 --> 29:22.139
- I want you to help me.

29:23.382 --> 29:25.487
And not just for me, because
he's your best friend, Kenneth.

29:26.454 --> 29:27.282
- Look, just because he's
my best friend

29:28.318 --> 29:29.422
doesn't mean I have to listen
to some crazy talk

29:30.009 --> 29:31.045
about him being dead.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.846
I didn't mean crazy like that.

29:41.434 --> 29:43.712
- It's just a gut feeling
that I have, okay?

29:44.886 --> 29:45.300
- Well, you also had
a gut feeling

29:46.370 --> 29:48.476
about me marrying Angela
Counter from junior year.

29:49.063 --> 29:49.857
See where that ended up.

29:50.547 --> 29:51.306
- Please, Ken, you're the--

29:51.790 --> 29:52.549
[phone vibrates]

29:52.998 --> 29:53.826
- Jen! - What?

29:54.620 --> 29:56.277
- Leave now, I'm being watched.

29:57.174 --> 29:58.348
You can't leave,
you'll get trapped.

29:58.969 --> 30:00.281
Here are the instructions.

30:01.213 --> 30:02.352
If you find this, please.

30:02.870 --> 30:05.286
[Brian screams]

30:05.907 --> 30:06.874
- Whoa, whoa, what is it?

30:07.564 --> 30:08.876
- Look at the last message.

30:10.774 --> 30:13.190
- It's a text message from
Brian, but it's empty.

30:14.364 --> 30:15.710
- Let me see it.

30:18.989 --> 30:20.404
It was a video
message from Brian.

30:21.612 --> 30:24.581
He was screaming, and there were
all these horrible sounds.

30:26.479 --> 30:28.067
- Look, Jennifer.

30:30.104 --> 30:31.277
Get ahold of yourself.

30:31.899 --> 30:33.728
There's nothing wrong.

30:35.661 --> 30:36.800
- I'll be right back.

30:47.052 --> 30:49.261
Jen, you need to get
ahold of yourself.

30:50.089 --> 30:52.471
He left on a trip,
he was pissed.

30:53.127 --> 30:54.438
Everything's gonna be fine.

31:00.617 --> 31:02.861
[creaking]

31:04.483 --> 31:06.209
[gasps]

31:07.106 --> 31:10.109
Man, I'm really
starting to lose it.

31:12.353 --> 31:13.872
No, no, no, no. - Jennifer,
please help me!

31:14.320 --> 31:14.631
- No, no, no!

31:15.770 --> 31:18.497
No, no, no, no, it's not real,
it's not real, not real.

31:19.049 --> 31:20.292
No, no, no, no, no.

31:21.362 --> 31:23.812
This isn't real, this isn't
real, this isn't real.

31:24.123 --> 31:24.952
- Jen.

31:26.160 --> 31:26.850
- This isn't real,
this isn't real.

31:27.609 --> 31:29.025
This isn't real,
this isn't real.

31:29.508 --> 31:30.716
This isn't real.

31:31.165 --> 31:31.441
This isn't real.

31:31.993 --> 31:33.684
- [Brian] Help, Jen.

31:34.996 --> 31:37.205
Jennifer, look at me.

31:38.758 --> 31:41.313
- This isn't real. - Look at me!

31:46.490 --> 31:49.804
[gentle alt rock music]

31:57.570 --> 31:58.330
- Hey!

31:58.882 --> 31:59.848
Jen, are you okay?

32:01.471 --> 32:02.127
Jennifer, you in there?

32:02.541 --> 32:03.542
[knocking]

32:03.991 --> 32:05.682
[tense music]

32:06.614 --> 32:07.995
Hey, come on, answer me,
are you all right?

32:08.788 --> 32:10.342
- Why are you doing this to me?

32:13.552 --> 32:14.863
- I don't have time.

32:15.899 --> 32:19.627
Please, I need you to come
back to the house.

32:21.767 --> 32:22.319
- But you said that--

32:22.975 --> 32:24.114
- He's right, Jennifer.

32:25.702 --> 32:26.082
You have to go help him.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.325
Don't let him down like
we did before.

32:28.912 --> 32:29.913
This time it's real.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.953
You know what, maybe, maybe we
did let him down.

32:36.230 --> 32:37.472
Maybe it is our fault.

32:38.577 --> 32:41.097
Maybe whatever he had to do
for the grant he got

32:41.752 --> 32:42.477
got him a little trouble.

32:43.478 --> 32:45.618
Maybe, maybe there wasn't
a grant at all.

32:46.688 --> 32:48.725
Did you ever think about that?
- No, don't, don't.

32:49.415 --> 32:52.039
- Maybe I did have the money,

32:52.971 --> 32:53.626
but I wanted to
punish him a little

32:54.489 --> 32:58.010
for what his mother did
to our family.

32:59.632 --> 33:02.670
You know, there are a lot of
questions to answer.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.707
- A lot of questions that
won't be answered

33:06.639 --> 33:09.090
unless you follow
through to the end.

33:09.573 --> 33:10.781
Right, Jennifer?

33:11.506 --> 33:13.612
- Follow through. - To the end.

33:15.096 --> 33:18.306
- Yes, Jennifer, it's
the only way.

33:18.686 --> 33:20.205
[yelps]

33:20.722 --> 33:22.414
Please! [screams]

33:22.897 --> 33:25.382
[tense music]

33:35.703 --> 33:36.773
[unsettling music]

33:37.084 --> 33:38.188
- Brian!

33:38.533 --> 33:39.707
Brian!

33:40.156 --> 33:42.434
Brian, Brian!

33:45.092 --> 33:46.610
- Miss, excuse me.

33:47.473 --> 33:49.061
Is everything all
right in there?

33:50.269 --> 33:51.063
Miss?

33:52.409 --> 33:53.652
Miss, are you okay?

34:04.076 --> 34:04.904
- Jen, what's up?

34:06.113 --> 34:07.942
Hey, whoa, hold on, hold on!

34:08.425 --> 34:10.427
[ominous music]

34:10.945 --> 34:12.188
Hey Jen, wait up!

34:14.052 --> 34:14.880
Jennifer!

34:15.812 --> 34:17.054
Hey, just stop right there!

34:17.641 --> 34:19.228
Jen, where you going?

34:19.918 --> 34:20.989
Hey, come on, hold on, wait!

34:21.404 --> 34:22.232
Wait for me.

34:23.199 --> 34:23.853
Hey, what was that back there?

34:24.855 --> 34:25.408
- You wouldn't even believe
me if I told you.

34:26.443 --> 34:26.754
- [Kenneth] Why don't you
try to explain it?

34:27.996 --> 34:28.928
- Because you'd think that I'm
just some fucking crazy bitch

34:29.652 --> 34:29.895
that's freaking out over nothing

34:30.896 --> 34:33.692
when there's something
actually fucking wrong!

34:34.382 --> 34:36.902
- [shushes] Jen. - There is.

34:37.627 --> 34:39.629
- It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

34:43.219 --> 34:45.911
Look, look, if you want me to go
in there with you, I will.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.947
But we're only gonna get your
brother's gear and get out.

34:49.397 --> 34:49.570
Nothing else.

34:50.605 --> 34:51.226
- But we gotta get-- - No,
what we have to do

34:52.193 --> 34:52.918
is get your brother's
stuff out of there

34:53.574 --> 34:54.815
before that house gets sold.

34:55.748 --> 34:55.989
- [Jennifer] What if
there's something

34:56.577 --> 34:57.612
actually wrong, Kenneth?

34:58.958 --> 35:00.443
- Let me be the judge of that.

35:01.961 --> 35:02.790
Do you trust me?

35:04.067 --> 35:05.379
Do you trust me?

35:07.001 --> 35:08.313
Do you trust me?

35:16.148 --> 35:17.115
It's gonna be okay.

35:21.740 --> 35:22.672
Look, let me drive, okay?

35:23.638 --> 35:25.261
Just leave it here,
we'll get it later.

35:25.847 --> 35:26.814
We'll get it later.

35:32.751 --> 35:35.202
Listen, just calm down, okay?

35:36.410 --> 35:37.238
Breathe.

35:38.446 --> 35:40.483
- [Jennifer] There it is.

35:43.348 --> 35:44.556
- It doesn't look so bad.

35:46.627 --> 35:48.870
For a house that's supposed to
be really messed up.

36:04.817 --> 36:05.853
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.062
Just grabbing something.

36:08.683 --> 36:09.063
- Why are you taking that

36:09.960 --> 36:10.409
if you don't think
anything's wrong?

36:11.583 --> 36:14.379
- [Kenneth] Cause sometimes
things go bump in the night.

36:19.729 --> 36:20.454
- What now?

36:21.040 --> 36:22.594
- Nothing, nothing.

36:23.457 --> 36:24.492
Where's the landlord.

36:25.666 --> 36:27.737
- I walked here, it's healthier.

36:28.876 --> 36:29.773
You should try it.

36:30.981 --> 36:31.430
You might live longer.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.121
- Jesus, man, don't do that.

36:34.019 --> 36:34.537
- What are you, like,
I don't know,

36:35.572 --> 36:38.265
scared something's gonna pop
out and get you?

36:39.231 --> 36:40.577
Booga booga booga? [chuckles]

36:41.682 --> 36:43.925
- It's just when people
materialized out of nowhere.

36:44.478 --> 36:45.306
You know-- - Listen,

36:46.273 --> 36:48.240
I didn't mean to scare you,
all right?

36:48.758 --> 36:49.586
You'll be okay.

36:51.761 --> 36:52.520
[door closes]

36:53.176 --> 36:53.694
- Why are you so jumpy?

36:54.315 --> 36:54.557
Earlier you were all like,

36:55.558 --> 36:56.386
ah, there's nothing wrong
with that house.

36:56.904 --> 36:57.491
- I am not jumpy.

36:58.457 --> 36:59.286
- [Jennifer] Bullshit
you're not jumpy.

37:00.356 --> 37:00.873
- [Kenneth] Look, I'm not
afraid of that guy.

37:01.943 --> 37:04.222
Maybe you're afraid of him, and
you're projecting.

37:05.084 --> 37:05.430
You're projecting
your fear on me.

37:06.293 --> 37:07.017
- Yeah, so as soon as
you saw him,

37:07.915 --> 37:08.226
that's why you almost
shit yourself.

37:08.812 --> 37:09.296
- I did not shit myself.

37:10.193 --> 37:10.814
Might have peed a little,
though.

37:11.298 --> 37:12.126
Hey, wait up!

37:14.956 --> 37:15.785
Sir?

37:17.027 --> 37:18.650
How long have you
owned this place?

37:20.272 --> 37:22.101
- For a while. - How
long's a while?

37:24.172 --> 37:25.726
[groans]

37:26.347 --> 37:28.315
- [Steve] About 10 years.

37:31.870 --> 37:33.975
- Has anything like this
ever happened before?

37:35.149 --> 37:37.979
- I mean, I've had a few
people up and leave,

37:38.842 --> 37:42.363
but no, never
anything like this.

37:44.158 --> 37:44.848
- And you said before that you
have to make money

37:45.953 --> 37:48.542
just like everybody, like you
have done this before.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.614
- Well, there was this one kid.

37:53.374 --> 37:55.687
Yeah, when I was going
through his stuff,

37:56.377 --> 37:59.277
I found a few keys of cocaine

38:00.623 --> 38:03.004
parsed away in
two-liter soda bottles.

38:05.938 --> 38:08.044
Let's just say it more
than took care

38:08.631 --> 38:10.909
of his outstanding rent.

38:12.738 --> 38:14.188
Know what I mean?

38:17.191 --> 38:19.297
So will this be your
last trip here?

38:20.505 --> 38:21.678
- Yeah, I mean, with
Kenneth here,

38:22.576 --> 38:24.198
we should be able to get
everything out.

38:24.750 --> 38:25.268
- Well that's good,

38:26.476 --> 38:29.548
cause I'd really like to get
this place cleaned up tomorrow,

38:30.791 --> 38:32.068
and get this place ready to
rent again, you know?

38:33.241 --> 38:36.106
- Yes sir, I guarantee we're
gonna get all his stuff out.

38:37.556 --> 38:38.764
- Excellent, excuse me.

38:40.663 --> 38:42.665
[sighs]

38:44.080 --> 38:45.909
Now my favorite TV show's
coming on, you see?

38:47.704 --> 38:49.534
And I really hate to
miss an episode.

38:51.087 --> 38:55.091
So if you guys need anything,
you just yell.

38:56.782 --> 38:57.576
- Will do.

39:04.618 --> 39:05.377
See what I mean?

39:05.998 --> 39:06.240
- About the landlord?

39:07.275 --> 39:07.690
- [Jennifer] Yeah, the
drug-running landlord.

39:08.863 --> 39:09.968
- Yeah, pretty creepy as far as
landlords are concerned.

39:11.038 --> 39:12.902
- Okay, first thing I saw
was on his computer.

39:13.247 --> 39:14.697
[laughs]

39:15.767 --> 39:17.493
- One of these, now this is in
pristine condition.

39:18.425 --> 39:20.012
You can see that it's in
fantastic shape.

39:20.806 --> 39:22.946
This is a ceremonial ax,
or a bot.

39:24.051 --> 39:27.123
- What's so scary about some
ancient Mayan artifacts?

39:28.055 --> 39:30.057
It's pretty right on the
point with Brian.

39:31.507 --> 39:33.025
- What the hell, that was not
there two days ago.

39:33.716 --> 39:35.545
- Uh-huh, and what was there?

39:37.444 --> 39:37.823
- It was Brian.

39:38.893 --> 39:41.517
- And let me guess, he was
asking us for help.

39:43.208 --> 39:45.244
- [Jennifer] No, he was
asking us to leave now.

39:46.107 --> 39:48.386
- Well, I suggest we do
what he said.

39:50.111 --> 39:51.527
- [Jennifer] I don't understand.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.394
- Look.

40:03.055 --> 40:04.712
Hey, I'm gonna go to
the bathroom.

40:05.679 --> 40:07.439
Man, this room stinks.

40:09.959 --> 40:11.409
- [Jennifer] Hey Ken?

40:11.754 --> 40:12.548
- Yeah?

40:13.549 --> 40:14.550
- Maybe you're right.

40:15.516 --> 40:16.931
Maybe I'm just freaking out.

40:18.243 --> 40:20.348
- Jennifer, it's gonna
be all right.

40:21.073 --> 40:22.730
Let's just get out of here ASAP.

40:47.893 --> 40:50.378
[phone rings]

40:54.590 --> 40:55.280
- Hello?

40:55.901 --> 40:57.455
- Hey, Chris, it's Kenny.

40:58.076 --> 40:59.077
- Hey, Kenneth, long time.

41:00.181 --> 41:03.012
- Yeah, you know, Brian was
kinda pissed, and...

41:04.392 --> 41:05.704
Well, anyway, speaking of Brian,

41:06.567 --> 41:07.913
I'm at his place with Jennifer,
and--

41:08.535 --> 41:09.950
- Did you find anything?

41:10.433 --> 41:10.744
- Not really.

41:11.848 --> 41:14.368
It doesn't look like anybody's
been here for months.

41:14.989 --> 41:16.197
The place is a total mess.

41:16.888 --> 41:18.165
- Shit. - Look, don't worry.

41:18.786 --> 41:20.029
We're gonna keep looking.

41:23.377 --> 41:25.793
But Chris, I'm really getting
worried about Jen.

41:26.725 --> 41:28.624
I think this is all
going to her head.

41:29.763 --> 41:30.211
I think she had another
episode today.

41:31.040 --> 41:31.419
We were having lunch
at Sunny's--

41:32.282 --> 41:33.318
- Do you know if she
has her pills?

41:34.353 --> 41:36.494
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure she
does have them.

41:38.185 --> 41:39.876
- Okay, what address are you at?

41:40.532 --> 41:43.639
- 4321 Sans Point Avenue.

41:45.675 --> 41:46.504
Yeah, it's my cell.

41:47.366 --> 41:49.023
I'll call you if
anything changes.

41:50.162 --> 41:50.956
Oh, Chris.

41:53.027 --> 41:54.270
Can you please just give
Jennifer a call,

41:55.133 --> 41:56.721
just to make sure
she's all right?

41:57.342 --> 41:58.999
- Okay, thanks, Kenneth.

42:01.415 --> 42:03.451
- No problem, thank you.

42:08.940 --> 42:10.320
[ominous music]

42:10.907 --> 42:12.978
- No, really, thanks.

42:14.014 --> 42:14.842
- Chris?

42:15.843 --> 42:16.154
What the hell?

42:17.189 --> 42:18.466
- You know I really appreciate
you helping me out

42:19.088 --> 42:20.814
with them like this, Ken.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.056
I need all the help I can get.

42:22.643 --> 42:24.058
- Whoa, whoa, hold up.

42:24.749 --> 42:26.440
You're like a mother to them.

42:26.854 --> 42:27.303
To me, even.

42:28.166 --> 42:30.789
- Well, that was then,
this is now.

42:34.482 --> 42:35.518
- The fuck?

42:36.070 --> 42:39.004
The fuck? [chuckles]

42:39.626 --> 42:40.558
Get ahold of yourself.

42:41.179 --> 42:43.008
What the fuck was that?

42:45.804 --> 42:47.806
Hey, somebody's in here!

42:48.255 --> 42:49.049
Who's that?

42:55.538 --> 42:57.160
What the fuck?

42:59.715 --> 43:01.579
[screams]

43:02.027 --> 43:03.373
Excuse me, Miss.

43:11.450 --> 43:12.279
- Oh god.

43:14.039 --> 43:15.282
Please help me.

43:23.152 --> 43:24.049
Get out.

43:24.498 --> 43:25.499
Get out now.

43:25.844 --> 43:27.535
[screams]

43:27.846 --> 43:28.675
Help me!

43:34.957 --> 43:38.581
[growling] [crunching]

43:39.030 --> 43:40.376
- What the fuck!

43:53.631 --> 43:55.736
[screams]

44:02.225 --> 44:03.054
Bri?

44:07.575 --> 44:08.576
Is that you?

44:10.889 --> 44:11.683
Brian?

44:13.409 --> 44:14.237
Brian.

44:17.206 --> 44:20.105
[foreboding music]

44:21.900 --> 44:24.178
- Ah, stop worrying about it,
Jennifer.

44:25.248 --> 44:28.389
It's a stupid artifact, like
a piece of a wall.

44:32.359 --> 44:33.809
Or something like that.

44:51.550 --> 44:51.896
- Okay, Brian?

44:53.035 --> 44:54.692
We're back at the hotel room
near the excavation site,

44:55.693 --> 44:58.592
and this is, I don't even
know where to begin.

44:59.904 --> 45:00.145
Let's start over here, okay?

45:00.801 --> 45:01.975
We've got some photographs.

45:02.458 --> 45:02.976
[TV chatters]

45:04.011 --> 45:06.393
- Hey guys, can you turn the
TV down, please?

45:13.227 --> 45:14.539
Seriously, guys!

45:15.436 --> 45:17.197
- You guys need something?

45:18.405 --> 45:20.545
- Christ, this always happens.

45:21.063 --> 45:22.581
Need my own place.

45:24.066 --> 45:27.241
- Of some drawings actually on
the sides of the temple.

45:28.208 --> 45:29.796
Now I will show some
closeups of these later,

45:30.797 --> 45:31.556
but these things are
absolutely amazing.

45:32.591 --> 45:35.663
They seem to indicate that
what we've stumbled on

45:36.630 --> 45:40.599
is some sort of rogue
sect of believers

45:41.497 --> 45:42.981
who followed the Mayan
deity Pach-We.

45:44.017 --> 45:45.950
Now that translates, very
roughly of course,

45:46.467 --> 45:47.089
to Flesh Eater.

45:48.159 --> 45:53.164
Now these pictures also show
some sort of ceremony

45:54.613 --> 45:55.407
that they conducted, some sort
of sacrificial ceremony.

45:55.960 --> 45:57.616
[tapping] [chanting]

45:58.548 --> 46:00.447
You know, we also found
some metal pieces,

46:01.482 --> 46:03.450
which we also believe are
part of the ceremony.

46:04.416 --> 46:05.763
And this is complete
conjecture on our part,

46:06.694 --> 46:07.661
but I think maybe
they're even using

46:08.489 --> 46:09.939
some sort of tinfoil hats,
right?

46:10.284 --> 46:10.975
[laughs]

46:11.423 --> 46:11.907
I'm kidding.

46:12.562 --> 46:13.494
Now, interestingly enough,

46:14.357 --> 46:15.669
you'll notice that
the victims here

46:16.843 --> 46:20.260
are having their hearts drawn or
pulled out of their body.

46:21.261 --> 46:22.814
Now we're not sure, it
could be a metaphor,

46:23.746 --> 46:25.196
it could be some sort of
actual parasite.

46:26.266 --> 46:28.095
But what we do think is, you'll
notice these lines

46:29.234 --> 46:30.788
around the victims' heads, or
the sacrificees' heads,

46:31.789 --> 46:33.169
and we believe that
indicates that they were

46:33.929 --> 46:35.482
in some sort of ecstatic state,

46:36.586 --> 46:41.281
experiencing some form of
almost mental trance.

46:43.421 --> 46:46.458
According to these drawings-- -
Nix the ceremonial ax.

46:46.907 --> 46:48.460
Item number 215.

46:49.461 --> 46:50.704
- You can see that it's in
fantastic shape.

46:51.878 --> 46:54.984
This is a ceremonial ax, or a
bot, that they would use.

46:55.847 --> 46:56.227
Now it looks like in
the drawings

46:57.435 --> 47:00.852
they would somehow draw these
creatures out of some sort.

47:02.750 --> 47:04.338
And then, bam, they'd just go
ahead and chop it right there,

47:05.167 --> 47:07.307
and hit it as hard
as they could.

47:08.342 --> 47:08.964
And that would be some part
of the ceremony.

47:09.896 --> 47:11.414
Now we also found--
[moaning on TV]

47:12.001 --> 47:13.382
- God damn it, really?

47:15.108 --> 47:16.040
Guys!

47:17.696 --> 47:18.525
What the hell?

47:23.081 --> 47:27.223
[roaring] [yelps]

47:30.399 --> 47:32.573
[screams]

47:34.921 --> 47:37.406
[tense music]

47:38.821 --> 47:40.961
[beeping]

47:43.239 --> 47:44.206
- Here's the piece
de resistance.

47:45.138 --> 47:49.452
We have an actual
fossilized human heart.

47:50.937 --> 47:51.834
I know, I know, I couldn't
believe it either at first.

47:52.524 --> 47:52.973
[groaning] - What was that?

47:54.147 --> 47:55.355
- [Professor] I was actually
thinking about boxing it up

47:56.011 --> 47:57.564
in a giant Valentine's box.

48:00.739 --> 48:03.259
- Great, this guy just spills
his stuff and leaves.

48:04.295 --> 48:05.123
Fuck this guy.

48:07.125 --> 48:07.919
Steve!

48:12.303 --> 48:13.131
Steve!

48:14.305 --> 48:16.963
[ominous music]

48:24.625 --> 48:26.006
Ken, this guy is just...

48:29.147 --> 48:29.941
Brian?

48:36.327 --> 48:39.709
Damn it, Jennifer, get
ahold of yourself.

48:44.714 --> 48:45.543
Ken!

48:46.475 --> 48:46.682
What did you do, did you--

48:47.717 --> 48:48.546
- [Brian] Yeah, man, just
put it over there.

48:48.960 --> 48:49.788
- Fall in.

48:53.792 --> 48:54.000
Brian?

48:55.001 --> 48:57.175
- Dude, did you see that
next-door neighbor?

48:57.589 --> 48:57.935
- No, why?

48:58.866 --> 49:01.593
- Dude, smoking hot, I'd
love to just...

49:06.322 --> 49:07.979
- I'm sorry, Jennifer.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.709
- No, no, no, no, no.

49:22.269 --> 49:23.581
[laughs]

49:24.271 --> 49:25.963
What are you sorry for, Brian?

49:26.860 --> 49:29.932
God damn you, what are
you sorry for?

49:31.313 --> 49:33.384
[thunder rumbles]

49:34.040 --> 49:34.833
- [Cory] Hey, is that it?

49:35.524 --> 49:37.008
Or is there more in the truck?

49:43.118 --> 49:44.291
- Brian, you okay?

49:45.948 --> 49:47.087
- Holy shit.

49:47.536 --> 49:48.399
- Yeah, why?

49:50.918 --> 49:52.644
- You look like you saw a ghost.

49:56.786 --> 49:58.685
- Could've sworn I just
saw my sister.

50:01.481 --> 50:03.207
- [Elizabeth] Sure you're okay?

50:03.793 --> 50:04.311
- Nothing, I'm fine.

50:05.450 --> 50:08.246
I'm just tired from the move and
all the research work.

50:08.902 --> 50:10.145
- You know what you need?

50:11.491 --> 50:12.664
- Some of that new neighbor
action. [chuckles]

50:13.251 --> 50:14.666
Know what I'm saying?

50:15.012 --> 50:15.771
What?

50:16.220 --> 50:16.841
I'm just saying.

50:17.911 --> 50:18.360
Come on, man, let's get the
rest of the stuff

50:19.395 --> 50:21.087
out of the truck and kick back
and have a couple.

50:21.639 --> 50:24.228
[foreboding music]

50:24.883 --> 50:26.471
- Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

50:27.921 --> 50:30.751
- Just remember, the
offer still stands.

50:32.063 --> 50:33.547
Whenever you want.

50:38.863 --> 50:40.554
[door closes]

50:40.899 --> 50:41.693
- Brian!

50:42.591 --> 50:45.835
I'm right here!

50:46.146 --> 50:46.974
Brian!

50:49.184 --> 50:49.977
Brian!

50:51.220 --> 50:52.428
I'm right here!

50:53.774 --> 50:56.777
Brian, I'm right--

50:57.261 --> 50:58.779
[keys clicking]

50:59.125 --> 50:59.953
Here?

51:07.581 --> 51:12.586
What the?

51:16.901 --> 51:17.729
Brian!

51:19.076 --> 51:21.112
Brian, Brian!

51:22.182 --> 51:22.665
- Hey, what's up?

51:23.321 --> 51:23.666
- [Jennifer] Oh, thank god.

51:24.391 --> 51:26.531
- Hey, how's it going? - Shit.

51:27.153 --> 51:28.395
- I don't mind, actually.

51:30.673 --> 51:31.916
- Kim, still?

51:33.366 --> 51:38.198
- Did you know that this ax was
used for sacrifice

51:38.819 --> 51:40.097
to a Mayan god?

51:41.063 --> 51:41.995
- Ugh, so scary.

51:42.892 --> 51:43.479
- They also used to
cut off the skin

51:44.480 --> 51:46.482
and hang it up as a
safeguard for the god.

51:48.622 --> 51:50.141
- Way too much information.

51:53.524 --> 51:54.180
- You're such a nerd.

51:54.801 --> 51:56.458
- Yeah, but you like it.

51:56.906 --> 51:57.321
- Sometimes.

51:57.942 --> 51:59.944
- You think it's sexy.

52:00.841 --> 52:02.326
- Oh yeah.

52:06.916 --> 52:07.986
- What the fuck?

52:12.094 --> 52:14.234
- Hey, sorry, guys, am
I interrupting?

52:15.822 --> 52:17.168
- No, not at all, what's up?

52:17.824 --> 52:18.135
- [Cory] Not much, man.

52:18.859 --> 52:19.964
Well, what are you working on?

52:20.896 --> 52:22.208
- Well, currently
cataloging an ancient ax

52:23.001 --> 52:24.900
from the city of Kaminal Juy'u.

52:25.349 --> 52:26.557
- Kamina what?

52:27.972 --> 52:29.525
- Kaminal Juy'u, it's
a Mayan city,

52:30.595 --> 52:32.735
in the valley of what is now
modern day Guatemala.

52:34.254 --> 52:34.496
- You know what, I'll let
you guys talk.

52:35.117 --> 52:36.705
I'm gonna take a shower.

52:40.916 --> 52:42.918
- So how do you end up with
crazy Guatemalan axes?

52:43.815 --> 52:45.127
Sounds a lot cooler
than med school.

52:46.024 --> 52:46.508
- Yeah, well,
eventually you and Liz

52:47.543 --> 52:47.888
are gonna be making a lot more
money than I will,

52:48.993 --> 52:50.339
so I wouldn't get too suckered
in by all this stuff.

52:50.719 --> 52:51.478
Trust me.

52:52.238 --> 52:52.445
I've seen some pretty weird shit

52:53.204 --> 52:54.585
over the past couple years, man.

52:57.277 --> 52:58.036
Seriously weird.

53:00.763 --> 53:01.247
Anyway, when we were younger,

53:02.248 --> 53:03.076
my sister and I would dig
in the backyard

53:04.008 --> 53:05.182
like we were a couple of
treasure hunters.

53:05.872 --> 53:07.701
- [Cory] [chuckles] Really?

53:08.081 --> 53:08.323
- Yeah.

53:09.013 --> 53:09.220
I remember I found this rock

53:10.187 --> 53:12.085
with a piece of fossil
embedded in it.

53:13.983 --> 53:14.984
Thought that was the
coolest thing.

53:15.502 --> 53:17.021
- I remember that.

53:18.988 --> 53:19.920
- I researched for days
trying to figure out

53:20.404 --> 53:20.783
what it was, too.

53:21.957 --> 53:24.097
And then when I finally did, I
remember I ran up to her,

53:24.856 --> 53:25.961
and I yelled, it's an ammonite!

53:26.272 --> 53:28.343
[laughs]

53:31.000 --> 53:31.829
- Yeah.

53:33.002 --> 53:34.970
So does your sister do
this as well?

53:40.251 --> 53:41.148
- No.

53:41.770 --> 53:44.082
No, she kinda withdrew.

53:45.498 --> 53:48.294
You know, after our parents
died, she got really depressed.

53:49.295 --> 53:50.537
She was committed for a while.

53:50.917 --> 53:51.435
- Really?

53:52.367 --> 53:53.230
- Yeah, what started
out as nightmares

53:53.851 --> 53:54.369
slowly became reality.

53:54.990 --> 53:56.198
- Oh, how do you mean?

53:58.235 --> 54:00.651
- She started having these
hallucinations.

54:05.172 --> 54:06.104
Yeah, she freaked out and she
started screaming,

54:06.657 --> 54:07.658
"Not you, not you."

54:08.314 --> 54:09.556
- [Cory] What'd she mean?

54:11.455 --> 54:12.041
- I don't know, she
never told me.

54:12.939 --> 54:15.079
- Thanks for telling my
life story, Bri.

54:16.977 --> 54:18.047
- She's okay now.

54:19.290 --> 54:20.464
She's an accountant.

54:21.050 --> 54:22.259
Self-made one, too.

54:24.157 --> 54:24.709
Actually, I haven't talked
to her in a while.

54:25.227 --> 54:26.055
I kinda miss her.

54:27.747 --> 54:28.575
- I miss you too.

54:31.854 --> 54:34.271
- Yeah, man, I know
what you mean.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.135
So what's up with this thing?

54:41.485 --> 54:41.830
- The Mayans used it as a tool

54:42.658 --> 54:43.659
for conducting
ritual sacrifices.

54:44.867 --> 54:46.904
- [Cory] I wonder how they did
that, the blade ain't even--

54:47.353 --> 54:48.733
Ow! [groans]

54:49.216 --> 54:49.838
- [Brian] Jesus.

54:50.563 --> 54:51.529
Oh, dude, that's a lot of blood.

54:52.047 --> 54:53.255
Oh, whoa, whoa!

54:53.600 --> 54:54.843
Oh, dude!

54:55.464 --> 54:56.362
Jesus, man, what'd you do?

54:56.983 --> 54:57.259
- I don't know, damn it.

54:57.915 --> 54:58.778
The blade didn't look sharp.

54:59.261 --> 54:59.399
- Let me see it.

55:00.193 --> 55:01.470
- It's like a freaking scalpel.

55:02.368 --> 55:02.540
- [Brian] All right, man,
come on,

55:03.300 --> 55:03.714
let's get that bandaged, Doctor.

55:04.784 --> 55:05.647
- [Cory] Well, make sure you
sterilize that thing.

55:06.544 --> 55:07.131
I don't wanna catch
the Mayan clap.

55:08.097 --> 55:08.960
- [Brian] Didn't have
sex with it, man.

55:10.030 --> 55:12.309
That's some powerful VD, though,
think about that.

55:13.240 --> 55:14.311
Gonna have to amputate
your whole hand.

55:14.794 --> 55:15.415
[ominous music]

55:15.898 --> 55:17.279
- What the hell?

55:17.659 --> 55:19.937
[cracking]

55:55.282 --> 55:56.560
- Okay, that's weird.

55:57.595 --> 55:59.494
Where did the heart go? - Brian,
the heart moved

56:00.149 --> 56:02.082
and went into the wall.

56:07.778 --> 56:10.021
[rumbling]

56:11.506 --> 56:13.162
Brian, Brian!

56:13.749 --> 56:15.786
- [Kim] Hey, you okay?

56:16.407 --> 56:17.753
- Yeah, yeah, just fine.

56:18.754 --> 56:20.135
- [Kim] I just thought
something was wrong.

56:20.929 --> 56:22.965
- [Brian] No, I'm cool,
it's fine.

56:23.656 --> 56:25.071
Everything's fine. - Brian.

56:27.107 --> 56:27.936
Bri?

56:28.971 --> 56:29.834
Why am I here?

56:37.635 --> 56:39.706
[groans]

56:41.846 --> 56:42.744
- Oh, damn.

56:44.987 --> 56:46.333
The hell happened?

56:51.511 --> 56:53.410
The hell happened here?

57:05.214 --> 57:06.699
The hell happened?

57:07.838 --> 57:08.666
- Kenneth!

57:10.081 --> 57:10.910
Kenneth!

57:12.221 --> 57:13.050
Kenneth!

57:15.811 --> 57:16.881
Kenneth! - Jen?

57:17.399 --> 57:17.848
Where'd you go?

57:18.780 --> 57:20.229
- [Jennifer] God, please
hear me, Kenneth!

57:20.747 --> 57:23.681
[static crackling]

57:27.961 --> 57:28.790
- Holy shit.

57:30.654 --> 57:31.586
What the fuck is going on?

57:32.656 --> 57:34.899
- I don't know, Ken, just
get me out of here!

57:36.729 --> 57:38.282
- How do you expect me to pull
that one off, sweetie?

57:39.421 --> 57:42.044
- [Jennifer] I don't know, just
figure something out!

57:50.225 --> 57:50.674
- [Dad] Let me see how
you do without me.

57:51.537 --> 57:51.916
- [Mary] I'll do
great without you,

57:52.779 --> 57:54.471
because I did great
with my life.

57:55.679 --> 57:56.714
- [Dad] Yeah, let me know when
you fucking figure that out.

57:57.474 --> 57:58.544
Figure it out, Mary, I wanna see

57:59.268 --> 57:59.614
how you fucking figure it out.

58:00.615 --> 58:01.029
- Oh, I will figure it out!
- You can't figure

58:01.650 --> 58:02.202
anything out on your own.

58:02.824 --> 58:03.065
- Oh, I'll figure it out.

58:04.066 --> 58:04.895
I figured plenty of
things out on my own,

58:05.482 --> 58:06.690
and you don't know.

58:07.725 --> 58:09.589
And I would rather die.

58:10.832 --> 58:12.454
[gun fires]

58:12.868 --> 58:13.869
- Jen, wait!

58:17.217 --> 58:19.599
[wind howls]

58:27.711 --> 58:29.367
[tense music]

58:29.713 --> 58:30.541
- What?

58:32.232 --> 58:33.061
- Hey.

58:34.027 --> 58:35.408
Is that this house?

58:38.238 --> 58:39.757
[audience applauds]

58:40.517 --> 58:42.070
Who are those people behind you?

58:44.244 --> 58:45.556
- Hey, you know you look sexy
when you do that?

58:46.488 --> 58:47.869
- When I play air drums
and take notes?

58:48.455 --> 58:50.181
- Yeah. - Seriously?

58:50.561 --> 58:50.734
- Yeah.

58:51.493 --> 58:51.700
- I guess what they say is true,

58:52.667 --> 58:54.565
you med school chicks are
damaged goods.

58:55.083 --> 58:55.739
- Fix me, Doctor.

58:56.602 --> 58:56.843
- Oh God, Ken, get me
out of here,

58:57.775 --> 58:58.293
I do not wanna see this.
[audience whoops]

58:59.501 --> 59:01.365
- I don't know, I'm thinking
about putting in some popcorn,

59:01.952 --> 59:02.953
extra buttery-- - Ken!

59:03.609 --> 59:05.403
- Sorry, just kidding, jeez.

59:08.993 --> 59:10.374
You might wanna turn around.

59:13.722 --> 59:15.759
- God, it's happening again.

59:16.553 --> 59:17.381
- What, what's happening again?

59:18.589 --> 59:20.177
- Trust me, you don't wanna
know, just get me out of here!

59:20.798 --> 59:22.904
- But I don't have a...

59:23.249 --> 59:24.491
Shit.

59:24.837 --> 59:25.941
No, no!

59:26.252 --> 59:27.080
Jen!

59:27.425 --> 59:28.254
Damn it!

59:29.980 --> 59:31.257
- Ken, get me out of here!

59:31.706 --> 59:33.431
[tense music]

59:33.742 --> 59:34.018
- No.

59:34.985 --> 59:36.573
- Guys, look behind you!
[audience cheering]

59:37.021 --> 59:38.713
Look behind you!

59:39.058 --> 59:39.576
Guys!

59:40.266 --> 59:42.095
Seriously, look behind you!

59:42.440 --> 59:42.682
Guys!

59:43.269 --> 59:46.341
[audience screaming]

59:51.311 --> 59:52.727
[Jennifer screams]

59:53.624 --> 59:54.936
- You're really
getting into this.

59:55.453 --> 59:56.351
Oh, okay, okay.

59:56.800 --> 59:58.077
Okay, all right.

59:58.767 --> 1:00:01.114
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:00:01.459 --> 1:00:02.253
Oh no.

1:00:03.772 --> 1:00:05.912
[screams]

1:00:11.297 --> 1:00:12.574
No, no, no, no.

1:00:13.989 --> 1:00:16.164
[screams]

1:00:24.655 --> 1:00:26.657
Don't just stand there, you
stupid bitch, run!

1:00:27.071 --> 1:00:28.348
[whimpers]

1:00:29.177 --> 1:00:31.938
Shut the fucking door,
you idiot!

1:00:36.356 --> 1:00:37.288
[Elizabeth screams] No, no, no,
no,

1:00:37.806 --> 1:00:39.290
don't go in there!

1:00:41.534 --> 1:00:43.363
- What, are you gonna sit around
and bitch at me all night?

1:00:43.881 --> 1:00:44.261
- Are you serious?

1:00:44.917 --> 1:00:45.262
- Why don't you understand?

1:00:45.883 --> 1:00:46.712
This is my job, all right?

1:00:47.436 --> 1:00:47.885
- I do understand that, okay?

1:00:48.921 --> 1:00:50.854
But you've been working on
this all weekend.

1:00:51.509 --> 1:00:51.820
You can't even look at me.

1:00:53.028 --> 1:00:53.719
I'm just asking you to spend a
little bit of time with me.

1:00:54.858 --> 1:00:57.619
- Yeah, well, I gotta be able to
pay bills, babe, okay?

1:00:58.102 --> 1:00:58.931
- Unbelievable.

1:01:02.831 --> 1:01:03.107
- What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1:01:03.970 --> 1:01:04.799
- This is what's fucking
wrong with me!

1:01:05.834 --> 1:01:07.077
- Kim, please, that is
priceless, all right?

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:07.767
That is special.

1:01:08.768 --> 1:01:09.424
Promise we will spend
some time together,

1:01:10.287 --> 1:01:11.840
but I need to get this done,
okay?

1:01:12.945 --> 1:01:14.187
Besides, didn't I spend all
last week with you?

1:01:15.154 --> 1:01:17.087
Taking you shopping,
buying you dresses!

1:01:17.777 --> 1:01:22.782
I mean, what if... [roaring]

1:01:23.645 --> 1:01:25.509
[screams] Kim!

1:01:27.166 --> 1:01:29.168
Kim, Kim!

1:01:31.791 --> 1:01:32.861
No!

1:01:33.206 --> 1:01:34.104
[shouts]

1:01:34.691 --> 1:01:37.694
[suspenseful music]

1:01:41.249 --> 1:01:41.905
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:01:42.975 --> 1:01:45.598
Brian, now is not the time,
you have to leave.

1:01:46.150 --> 1:01:46.910
- Come on, come on.

1:01:47.773 --> 1:01:48.635
- Here's the piece
de resistance.

1:01:49.567 --> 1:01:54.365
We have an actual
fossilized human heart.

1:01:59.888 --> 1:02:01.614
But what we do think is, you'll
notice these lines

1:02:02.753 --> 1:02:04.582
around the victims' heads, or
the sacrificees' heads.

1:02:05.411 --> 1:02:06.136
[gun fires] We believe
that indicates

1:02:07.206 --> 1:02:09.139
that they were in some sort
of ecstatic state,

1:02:10.209 --> 1:02:14.800
experiencing some form of
almost a mental trance.

1:02:18.700 --> 1:02:19.666
- No, Jen, wait!

1:02:23.256 --> 1:02:24.085
- Don't look.

1:02:26.397 --> 1:02:27.640
- Oh my god, Jen! - Brian!

1:02:28.572 --> 1:02:31.195
- Jen, if you find this,
please leave now.

1:02:32.162 --> 1:02:34.095
If you can't leave,
you'll get trapped.

1:02:36.580 --> 1:02:37.823
Here are the instructions.

1:02:38.168 --> 1:02:38.996
Watch.

1:02:39.928 --> 1:02:40.757
Leave now.

1:02:42.379 --> 1:02:43.345
Leave.

1:02:43.690 --> 1:02:44.484
Shit!

1:02:46.383 --> 1:02:48.385
Fuck, come on, come on.

1:02:49.593 --> 1:02:51.698
- Help! [banging]

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:54.529
- [Mirror Jennifer] The animal
became disenchanted.

1:02:55.841 --> 1:02:56.876
Some would say it was angry.
- Help me, help!

1:02:57.774 --> 1:02:59.085
- With its weak and
slender legs.

1:02:59.845 --> 1:03:00.017
- Are you gonna let me die here

1:03:01.122 --> 1:03:02.813
just like you let your sister
watch your mother

1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:04.090
blow her brains out?

1:03:04.608 --> 1:03:05.885
- No, no, no, no!

1:03:06.437 --> 1:03:06.783
[unsettling music]

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:08.405
- They didn't seem to
be as strong

1:03:09.268 --> 1:03:10.752
as those he had seen
on other deer.

1:03:11.615 --> 1:03:13.444
They didn't seem to
be as steady.

1:03:16.896 --> 1:03:18.518
He wondered how on earth they
were supporting him now.

1:03:19.450 --> 1:03:21.659
- You're weak, just
like your sister.

1:03:22.522 --> 1:03:24.801
And soon, we will have you both.

1:03:25.111 --> 1:03:25.284
- No.

1:03:26.388 --> 1:03:27.665
I won't let that happen. -
Brian almost got away.

1:03:28.632 --> 1:03:28.908
- What can you do? -
Found his strength,

1:03:29.875 --> 1:03:30.737
and it carried him to safety.
- You're weak.

1:03:31.462 --> 1:03:33.188
Weak and crazy. - For a time.

1:03:34.086 --> 1:03:35.156
- You're weak just
like your sister.

1:03:36.364 --> 1:03:38.745
- But then he came back, and he
got tangled in the trees.

1:03:39.470 --> 1:03:39.781
- Shut your mouth. - Like you?

1:03:40.886 --> 1:03:43.233
- And his death rattle brought
the lion another meal.

1:03:43.923 --> 1:03:44.303
- Shut up, shut up. - To us.

1:03:45.166 --> 1:03:45.580
- You know what the
difference is

1:03:46.305 --> 1:03:49.066
between you and I? - Shut up!

1:03:49.549 --> 1:03:50.378
- Where's Brian?

1:03:51.551 --> 1:03:53.415
- Spending some time
with a friend.

1:03:53.795 --> 1:03:55.935
[screams]

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:57.764
- Why me?

1:03:58.144 --> 1:03:59.007
Why Brian?

1:03:59.697 --> 1:04:01.734
- Because it's in the blood.

1:04:02.424 --> 1:04:03.494
It focuses on people like you.

1:04:04.047 --> 1:04:05.082
- Don't you mean us?

1:04:06.083 --> 1:04:07.015
- You mean you haven't
figured it out yet?

1:04:07.602 --> 1:04:08.016
- Figured out what?

1:04:08.741 --> 1:04:10.156
- How's Aunt Christine doing?

1:04:13.573 --> 1:04:14.160
- Why did you take me?

1:04:14.678 --> 1:04:16.128
[static crackles]

1:04:17.163 --> 1:04:20.201
- Brian, I did take you, you
and your sister,

1:04:20.891 --> 1:04:21.512
even though I wasn't ready.

1:04:22.306 --> 1:04:22.824
I mean, I had plans too,
you know.

1:04:23.445 --> 1:04:24.584
You guys changed all that.

1:04:25.137 --> 1:04:25.862
It was no big deal.

1:04:26.483 --> 1:04:27.656
I just had to readjust.

1:04:28.726 --> 1:04:30.452
Feed you and clothe you. -
You're not really here.

1:04:31.074 --> 1:04:31.384
You're not really here.

1:04:32.558 --> 1:04:36.217
- Pay for your head shrinking
and your anti-psychotics.

1:04:37.701 --> 1:04:38.875
But that's what families do for
each other, right?

1:04:39.599 --> 1:04:41.187
They help each other out! - No!

1:04:42.050 --> 1:04:45.260
- I am asking for your help now,
Brian.

1:04:46.158 --> 1:04:49.126
- Brian, don't listen to her,
okay?

1:04:49.713 --> 1:04:50.748
It's not Christine.

1:04:51.646 --> 1:04:53.959
Hey Brian, I need you
to leave now.

1:04:56.409 --> 1:04:58.377
I need you to be strong for me,
Brian, okay?

1:04:58.825 --> 1:05:00.413
- No, Brian.

1:05:01.725 --> 1:05:02.899
Stay with me.

1:05:05.142 --> 1:05:05.971
I was young. - Brian.

1:05:06.557 --> 1:05:07.627
- So young. - Brian!

1:05:09.629 --> 1:05:11.286
- I still am, you know?

1:05:12.184 --> 1:05:13.944
I can't believe how
you've grown up.

1:05:14.738 --> 1:05:16.153
You look just like your father.

1:05:16.671 --> 1:05:17.914
- Brian, Brian.

1:05:19.467 --> 1:05:22.470
[suspenseful music]

1:05:25.956 --> 1:05:26.784
Brian!

1:05:41.006 --> 1:05:42.593
- Also found some metal pieces,

1:05:43.629 --> 1:05:47.253
which we also believe are
part of the ceremony.

1:05:50.670 --> 1:05:52.845
[tapping]

1:06:02.475 --> 1:06:04.650
[tapping]

1:06:10.725 --> 1:06:11.622
We'll show some closeups
of these later,

1:06:12.589 --> 1:06:13.383
but these things are
absolutely amazing.

1:06:14.418 --> 1:06:17.456
They seem to indicate that
what we've stumbled on

1:06:18.422 --> 1:06:22.116
is some sort of rogue
sect of believers

1:06:23.048 --> 1:06:25.050
who followed the Mayan
deity Pach-We.

1:06:26.223 --> 1:06:28.950
That translates, very roughly of
course, to Flesh Eater.

1:06:30.020 --> 1:06:34.991
Now these pictures also show
some sort of ceremony

1:06:36.061 --> 1:06:37.200
some sort of
sacrificial ceremony.

1:06:38.235 --> 1:06:40.513
We're still trying to figure
out the details.

1:06:41.790 --> 1:06:43.033
You'll notice that
the victims here

1:06:44.241 --> 1:06:47.658
are having their hearts drawn or
pulled out of their body.

1:06:48.659 --> 1:06:50.282
Now we're not sure, it
could be a metaphor,

1:06:51.179 --> 1:06:51.628
it could be some sort of
actual parasite.

1:06:52.732 --> 1:06:54.907
You'll notice these lines around
the victims' heads,

1:06:55.528 --> 1:06:56.150
or the sacrificees' heads,

1:06:57.116 --> 1:06:58.117
and we believe that
indicates that they were

1:06:58.911 --> 1:07:00.430
in some sort of ecstatic state.

1:07:01.603 --> 1:07:04.813
The sacrificees had something
drawn out of their bodies.

1:07:06.298 --> 1:07:08.024
With this, I'll anticipate,
we're still very, very early

1:07:08.921 --> 1:07:09.784
in the stages here of
our analysis.

1:07:10.957 --> 1:07:14.099
This is a ceremonial ax, or a
bot, that they would use.

1:07:14.961 --> 1:07:15.307
Now it looks like in
the drawings

1:07:16.480 --> 1:07:19.000
that they somehow draw these
creatures out of some sort,

1:07:20.139 --> 1:07:21.692
and then bam, they just go ahead
and chop it right there

1:07:22.521 --> 1:07:24.143
and hit is as hard
as they could.

1:07:28.803 --> 1:07:31.288
[tense music]

1:07:32.634 --> 1:07:33.325
- I'm right here!

1:07:34.222 --> 1:07:36.776
Come on, come on, come
on and get me!

1:07:37.398 --> 1:07:38.778
What are you waiting for?

1:07:39.676 --> 1:07:42.058
Come on, come on, come
on and get me!

1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:44.267
Come on, what are you
waiting for?

1:07:44.784 --> 1:07:45.820
I'm right here!

1:07:46.407 --> 1:07:47.339
Come on, I'm right here!

1:07:47.891 --> 1:07:49.306
That's what it is.

1:07:50.549 --> 1:07:51.377
You are scared.

1:07:53.586 --> 1:07:57.142
Scared because you know that I
know how to kill you!

1:08:00.179 --> 1:08:02.975
Listen to me, can't even believe
this is happening.

1:08:03.355 --> 1:08:05.598
[growling]

1:08:10.189 --> 1:08:12.674
- No, no, wait, I can stop it!

1:08:22.374 --> 1:08:26.861
- You're not getting Jen, so
let's get this over with.

1:08:30.071 --> 1:08:32.660
[somber music]

1:08:34.212 --> 1:08:36.112
- Brian! - Jen, no!

1:08:37.941 --> 1:08:38.872
- Brian, why didn't you leave?

1:08:39.494 --> 1:08:42.428
- Because they wanted you.

1:08:43.878 --> 1:08:45.844
I know how to kill it.

1:08:46.432 --> 1:08:48.434
Stab me in the heart.

1:08:49.090 --> 1:08:50.367
- No, no, no, no, I can't.

1:08:50.953 --> 1:08:51.782
- Please! - I can't.

1:08:52.162 --> 1:08:52.921
- Please!

1:08:53.681 --> 1:08:55.786
Do it, do it! - I can't,
I can't!

1:08:56.166 --> 1:08:58.134
[screams]

1:08:58.443 --> 1:08:59.273
Brian!

1:09:01.344 --> 1:09:03.139
No, no.

1:09:16.807 --> 1:09:18.532
- You should have run, Jenn.

1:09:21.191 --> 1:09:22.503
Cause now you're mine.

1:09:22.848 --> 1:09:24.919
[laughs]

1:09:53.637 --> 1:09:55.052
- Don't look.

1:09:55.467 --> 1:09:57.814
[gun fires]

1:10:00.989 --> 1:10:02.300
- No, Jen, wait!

1:10:06.650 --> 1:10:07.478
- Mommy?

1:10:08.721 --> 1:10:09.550
- Jenny?

1:10:10.758 --> 1:10:14.486
I'm so sorry.

1:10:16.591 --> 1:10:17.489
[sobs]

1:10:17.972 --> 1:10:21.976
I am so sorry.

1:10:24.806 --> 1:10:27.291
Dear lord, forgive me.

1:10:29.501 --> 1:10:31.813
[gun fires]

1:10:36.370 --> 1:10:38.820
- So you think she saw it all?

1:10:40.374 --> 1:10:44.273
- Yeah, I think so, according
to what Brian said.

1:10:45.206 --> 1:10:47.380
Look, I'm sorry about
your brother.

1:10:48.347 --> 1:10:51.350
- He was a bastard to
Mary and the kids.

1:10:56.148 --> 1:10:57.287
- Are you gonna take custody?

1:10:58.668 --> 1:10:59.496
- Absolutely.

1:11:02.913 --> 1:11:03.535
[static crackles]

1:11:04.121 --> 1:11:05.778
- Come on, Jennifer!

1:11:07.124 --> 1:11:08.056
Where the hell did
you come from?

1:11:08.919 --> 1:11:10.023
- I couldn't save him.
- Save who?

1:11:10.576 --> 1:11:11.163
- [Jennifer] Brian.

1:11:11.715 --> 1:11:12.198
I couldn't save him.

1:11:12.785 --> 1:11:13.510
- [shushes] It's okay.

1:11:14.304 --> 1:11:15.409
I'm right here, I'm right here.

1:11:21.138 --> 1:11:22.761
- How do I know that
you're real?

1:11:26.282 --> 1:11:28.214
- I'm real, I'm real, is that
real enough for you?

1:11:28.732 --> 1:11:29.388
[foreboding music]

1:11:29.940 --> 1:11:31.148
Come on, let's go!

1:11:32.148 --> 1:11:32.495
- No, wait, we have to kill it.

1:11:33.254 --> 1:11:33.806
- What? - We have to kill it.

1:11:34.531 --> 1:11:35.360
- No, no, no. - It's coming out!

1:11:36.257 --> 1:11:37.189
We have to kill it! - No,
listen.

1:11:38.085 --> 1:11:40.296
We gotta get out of
here right now.

1:11:41.297 --> 1:11:42.090
Come on!

1:11:50.547 --> 1:11:51.652
What the fuck?

1:11:52.237 --> 1:11:53.585
Hey, just stay here.

1:11:57.485 --> 1:11:58.521
Oh, come on!

1:12:01.662 --> 1:12:03.491
- You see, it won't
let us leave.

1:12:06.356 --> 1:12:07.460
- The window, come on.

1:12:14.260 --> 1:12:15.710
This can't be happening.

1:12:23.856 --> 1:12:25.375
Why can't we leave, huh?

1:12:27.412 --> 1:12:28.654
What does it want, huh?

1:12:29.309 --> 1:12:29.793
What does it want from us?

1:12:30.276 --> 1:12:31.416
- It wants us!

1:12:32.693 --> 1:12:34.280
Don't you understand that?

1:12:34.833 --> 1:12:35.764
We have to kill it!

1:12:36.248 --> 1:12:38.733
[tense music]

1:12:43.531 --> 1:12:46.016
- And how do you suppose...

1:12:46.707 --> 1:12:49.330
How do you suppose we do that?

1:12:49.606 --> 1:12:50.400
Hm?

1:12:55.059 --> 1:12:58.891
- Brian left us
detailed instructions

1:12:59.478 --> 1:13:00.445
on what we need to do.

1:13:01.066 --> 1:13:02.895
We just need to do it.

1:13:04.725 --> 1:13:06.105
- Oh. [chuckles]

1:13:06.451 --> 1:13:07.279
Well.

1:13:09.833 --> 1:13:11.145
It's easier said than done.

1:13:12.559 --> 1:13:14.700
[mutters]

1:13:18.980 --> 1:13:22.294
- No, no, no, you don't have to,
okay?

1:13:22.708 --> 1:13:23.639
It wants me.

1:13:25.573 --> 1:13:27.299
It wants me, and that's
what it's gonna get.

1:13:27.644 --> 1:13:28.473
- What?

1:13:31.337 --> 1:13:34.443
- You just have to get it
while it's grabbing me,

1:13:35.341 --> 1:13:37.171
and you have to stab me
in the heart.

1:13:38.275 --> 1:13:39.242
Okay, while it's...

1:13:40.312 --> 1:13:40.485
- While it's what?

1:13:41.139 --> 1:13:42.418
- While it's eating me.

1:13:47.181 --> 1:13:50.391
That's the best time to do it,
when it's in-between planes,

1:13:51.288 --> 1:13:53.221
and that's when it's the
most vulnerable.

1:13:54.119 --> 1:13:56.121
That's what Brian tried to do,
but--

1:13:56.535 --> 1:13:57.433
- But what?

1:14:01.195 --> 1:14:02.023
- Nothing.

1:14:04.681 --> 1:14:05.751
- I can't.

1:14:06.338 --> 1:14:07.443
Jen, this is crazy.

1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:09.237
- Listen, Kenneth.

1:14:11.170 --> 1:14:13.827
We have to stand up and fight
this thing, okay?

1:14:14.933 --> 1:14:16.382
We have to do this.

1:14:16.934 --> 1:14:18.454
You have to do this.

1:14:19.558 --> 1:14:20.386
Okay?

1:14:29.948 --> 1:14:30.776
- Yeah.

1:14:35.228 --> 1:14:36.057
Yeah.

1:14:37.127 --> 1:14:37.852
Where's the weapon?

1:14:38.404 --> 1:14:41.304
[foreboding music]

1:14:44.652 --> 1:14:45.826
Come on, let's go.

1:14:46.343 --> 1:14:47.931
[shushes] Wait.

1:14:48.656 --> 1:14:49.070
Did you hear something? - What?

1:14:49.968 --> 1:14:52.487
- [Brian] Hey, Kenneth, Kenneth,
Kenneth.

1:14:53.109 --> 1:14:55.421
Kenneth, Kenneth, Kenneth.

1:14:55.905 --> 1:14:56.940
Kenneth, Kenneth.

1:14:57.562 --> 1:14:57.838
- Kenneth, don't listen,

1:14:58.735 --> 1:14:59.425
it's just this thing
toying with us.

1:15:00.081 --> 1:15:01.255
- But it sounds like Brian.

1:15:01.876 --> 1:15:02.946
Hey Brian, is that you?

1:15:03.429 --> 1:15:03.844
Where you at?

1:15:04.914 --> 1:15:08.020
- [Brian] I'm right here, Ken,
get me out of here.

1:15:08.675 --> 1:15:08.987
- Kenneth, that isn't Brian!

1:15:09.884 --> 1:15:10.091
Trust me, you don't
have to do this!

1:15:11.127 --> 1:15:12.508
- Why don't you wanna save
your brother, huh?

1:15:13.059 --> 1:15:13.300
He's in that wall.

1:15:14.337 --> 1:15:15.338
I can get him out and you
don't have to die.

1:15:15.787 --> 1:15:16.615
- What, Kenneth!

1:15:17.823 --> 1:15:18.548
I'm telling you he's
fucking gone!

1:15:19.135 --> 1:15:20.308
- No, no, he's not!

1:15:21.517 --> 1:15:23.103
He's in there, I'm
gonna get him out.

1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:24.450
We're ending this right now.

1:15:25.313 --> 1:15:29.386
- Just listen to yourself,
Kenneth!

1:15:30.318 --> 1:15:33.080
- Hang on, Bri, I'm
coming to get you!

1:15:33.598 --> 1:15:35.116
Coming to get you!

1:15:36.601 --> 1:15:38.809
[growling]

1:15:41.053 --> 1:15:41.882
The fuck?

1:15:45.541 --> 1:15:46.680
What the fuck?

1:15:48.059 --> 1:15:49.752
[shouts]

1:15:50.130 --> 1:15:50.960
Oh, oh!

1:15:54.550 --> 1:15:56.621
[groans]

1:16:09.772 --> 1:16:11.428
Brian, you in there?

1:16:13.327 --> 1:16:15.639
Brian, Brian!

1:16:17.124 --> 1:16:18.850
[grunts]

1:16:19.575 --> 1:16:20.679
I'm coming to get you, Brian!

1:16:21.335 --> 1:16:23.440
Coming to get you, Brian!

1:16:24.580 --> 1:16:25.407
Brian!

1:16:29.136 --> 1:16:30.137
Fuck, Brian!

1:16:36.177 --> 1:16:37.040
- [Brian] Kenneth.

1:16:38.523 --> 1:16:39.353
- Holy shit.

1:16:40.665 --> 1:16:43.668
- What, I told you I
was in here.

1:16:44.219 --> 1:16:45.704
Me and my friends.

1:16:48.983 --> 1:16:50.709
- Come on, Let's get
out of here!

1:16:51.089 --> 1:16:53.436
[giggles]

1:16:53.816 --> 1:16:56.094
[rumbling]

1:17:07.174 --> 1:17:08.002
Come on!

1:17:12.005 --> 1:17:13.663
[glass shatters]

1:17:14.284 --> 1:17:15.147
- [Kenneth] Jennifer!

1:17:15.734 --> 1:17:16.217
- Ken, your arm! - What?

1:17:17.115 --> 1:17:20.118
I know, we'll take
care of it later.

1:17:21.119 --> 1:17:22.291
[snarls]

1:17:22.638 --> 1:17:23.811
Come on!

1:17:24.260 --> 1:17:26.607
[gun fires]

1:17:27.608 --> 1:17:29.299
[shouts]

1:17:29.679 --> 1:17:31.647
[roars]

1:17:35.719 --> 1:17:36.686
Jen, the ax!

1:17:38.273 --> 1:17:39.102
- Got it.

1:17:41.691 --> 1:17:42.519
- Weak.

1:17:43.555 --> 1:17:44.383
Crazy.

1:17:45.350 --> 1:17:46.178
Weak.

1:17:47.145 --> 1:17:47.939
Crazy.

1:17:49.768 --> 1:17:50.562
- Give in.

1:17:50.942 --> 1:17:51.839
- Give up.

1:17:52.460 --> 1:17:53.530
- It's not that hard.

1:17:54.186 --> 1:17:54.877
- It's in your blood, baby.

1:17:55.740 --> 1:17:57.880
- She's right, it's
in our blood.

1:17:59.053 --> 1:18:03.333
Can you feel it?

1:18:03.817 --> 1:18:04.818
- No, get away!

1:18:05.163 --> 1:18:07.027
[shouts]

1:18:07.406 --> 1:18:09.407
[yelps]

1:18:14.897 --> 1:18:16.933
[growls]

1:18:27.254 --> 1:18:28.807
- You're gonna end up in the
padded room again.

1:18:29.152 --> 1:18:29.981
- No.

1:18:30.913 --> 1:18:31.050
No.

1:18:31.809 --> 1:18:33.812
- You know what you have to do.

1:18:34.710 --> 1:18:35.849
- You'll never amount
to anything.

1:18:36.434 --> 1:18:37.091
- Get away. [moans]

1:18:38.058 --> 1:18:39.715
- You'll never be like
what I've become!

1:18:40.646 --> 1:18:41.993
- Shut up! - You'll
always be weak!

1:18:42.718 --> 1:18:44.236
- Shut up! - Weak and crazy!

1:18:44.823 --> 1:18:45.134
- Shut up! - Jennifer!

1:18:46.273 --> 1:18:48.344
You know what you have to do! -
Crazy, weak and crazy!

1:18:49.034 --> 1:18:50.277
- Stop it! - Weak and crazy!

1:18:50.933 --> 1:18:51.898
Weak and crazy! - Shut up!

1:18:52.969 --> 1:18:55.558
- You have to kill me before
it kills us both!

1:18:56.248 --> 1:18:57.802
- Weak and crazy! - Kill me!

1:18:58.147 --> 1:18:58.526
[shouts]

1:18:59.355 --> 1:19:00.356
- There was a deer
in the forest.

1:19:00.977 --> 1:19:02.978
Summer was very, very hot.

1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:05.326
In the heat, the deer
became very thirsty.

1:19:06.431 --> 1:19:09.192
He found a small spring and
decided to take a drink.

1:19:10.262 --> 1:19:11.367
He noticed his
reflection in the water,

1:19:12.575 --> 1:19:16.234
and greatly admired the size and
the shape of his antlers.

1:19:16.924 --> 1:19:17.304
[screams] The animal became

1:19:17.787 --> 1:19:19.168
disenchanted.

1:19:19.651 --> 1:19:20.410
[creature roars]

1:19:21.273 --> 1:19:23.413
[groans] His weak
and small legs.

1:19:23.862 --> 1:19:24.103
[somber music]

1:19:25.105 --> 1:19:26.139
They didn't seem to be as
strong as those

1:19:26.796 --> 1:19:28.798
he had seen on other deer.

1:19:29.695 --> 1:19:31.525
They didn't seem to
be as steady.

1:19:34.493 --> 1:19:37.842
He wondered how on earth they
were supporting him.

1:19:38.843 --> 1:19:41.155
As the deer contemplated
himself in the spring,

1:19:41.707 --> 1:19:42.398
a lion approached.

1:19:43.433 --> 1:19:45.781
Seeing the deer so distracted,
the lion crouched.

1:19:46.126 --> 1:19:48.128
[roars]

1:19:52.891 --> 1:19:54.893
[groans]

1:19:55.480 --> 1:19:58.552
[creature screeches]

1:19:59.864 --> 1:20:00.934
The deer was very fast indeed,

1:20:02.004 --> 1:20:05.110
and as long as the path
remained smooth and open,

1:20:06.491 --> 1:20:07.594
the deer remained a safe
distance away.

1:20:07.975 --> 1:20:10.253
[shouting]

1:20:17.019 --> 1:20:19.159
[screams]

1:20:22.990 --> 1:20:25.130
The deer became entangled
with his antlers.

1:20:32.931 --> 1:20:36.107
Thus the lion caught him, and
had a wonderful meal that day.

1:20:36.590 --> 1:20:39.144
[somber music]

1:20:42.285 --> 1:20:43.079
- Fuck!

1:20:48.567 --> 1:20:50.466
[sobs]

1:21:00.303 --> 1:21:02.098
I get it now, you're
the monster too!

1:21:03.513 --> 1:21:06.032
- Still staring in your river,
admiring your antlers.

1:21:07.483 --> 1:21:08.898
You know, time's like a river,
you hear that a lot.

1:21:09.761 --> 1:21:11.280
So much so that it
loses meaning.

1:21:12.005 --> 1:21:13.627
But it's very true in many ways.

1:21:14.766 --> 1:21:15.353
One of which is crucial.

1:21:16.318 --> 1:21:18.839
Each choice cause a
diversion in the river,

1:21:19.529 --> 1:21:21.221
every one making a new branch.

1:21:22.118 --> 1:21:24.809
You're one, I'm another.

1:21:25.397 --> 1:21:26.088
- It doesn't make sense.

1:21:27.089 --> 1:21:28.745
- What of this makes sense
to any sane person?

1:21:29.228 --> 1:21:30.057
- We're the same!

1:21:32.508 --> 1:21:33.335
- Are we?

1:21:34.544 --> 1:21:36.477
- We both looked, we
both saw it!

1:21:37.962 --> 1:21:38.790
- We did.

1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:41.448
- Then why, how does that make
you any different?

1:21:41.966 --> 1:21:42.967
- We both looked!

1:21:43.968 --> 1:21:47.592
We both looked, we both
looked directly at it.

1:21:48.041 --> 1:21:49.352
Both saw it all.

1:21:52.148 --> 1:21:52.907
The difference is this.

1:21:53.874 --> 1:21:57.222
I'm the version of you
that didn't blink.

1:21:59.776 --> 1:22:01.261
Goodbye, Jennifer.

1:22:14.895 --> 1:22:16.827
[gags]

1:22:45.615 --> 1:22:46.340
- Jennifer?

1:22:46.927 --> 1:22:47.996
Jennifer, oh my god!

1:22:48.411 --> 1:22:49.240
Oh my god!

1:22:51.344 --> 1:22:52.001
Jennifer, I tried to call you.

1:22:53.106 --> 1:22:54.762
But somebody picked up, and all
I heard were these,

1:22:55.349 --> 1:22:56.626
these horrible sounds.

1:22:57.938 --> 1:22:59.491
And then I freaked.

1:23:01.424 --> 1:23:02.253
Jen.

1:23:03.530 --> 1:23:05.946
Oh, baby, why?

1:23:27.933 --> 1:23:31.246
[emergency sirens wail]

1:23:43.397 --> 1:23:46.262
