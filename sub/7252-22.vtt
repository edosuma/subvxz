[indistinct chatter on PA]

00:02.753 --> 00:06.173
Hi, hi, hello, yes,

00:02.753 --> 00:06.173
I'm here to pick up my daughter.

00:06.214 --> 00:08.133
- Your daughter's name?

00:06.214 --> 00:08.133
- Rory Gilmore.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.468
Lorelai Gilmore,

00:08.175 --> 00:09.468
She goes by Rory.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.511
I don't know

00:09.510 --> 00:10.511
what you have her under.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.095
Rory Gilmore.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.430
Well, that's good

00:12.137 --> 00:13.430
'cause she'll answer to that.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.974
Not that she won't

00:13.472 --> 00:14.974
to the other, but.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.100
- She'll be out in a minute.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.100
- Okay, thanks.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.895
Sorry, when you say

00:18.560 --> 00:19.895
"She'll be out."

00:19.937 --> 00:22.982
- Do you mean out of a cell?

00:19.937 --> 00:22.982
- Yep.

00:23.022 --> 00:25.776
So she was in a cell.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.195
That's where we usually put

00:25.818 --> 00:28.195
people when they're arrested.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.655
Was she in the cell alone?

00:29.697 --> 00:31.239
It was a slow night,

00:29.697 --> 00:31.239
she had the place to herself.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.074
[sighs]

00:31.281 --> 00:33.074
Oh, that's good.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.202
I mean, not that she's a snob.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.202
She can get along with anyone.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.120
It's just, it was

00:35.243 --> 00:37.120
her first time in a cell.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.914
So I didn't want

00:37.162 --> 00:38.914
her to be attacked.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.750
You know like in "Caged Heat"

00:38.956 --> 00:41.750
or was it "Switchblade Sisters?"

00:41.792 --> 00:44.920
Anyway, I mean my daughter

00:41.792 --> 00:44.920
never gets into trouble

00:44.962 --> 00:46.922
except, you know, now.

00:46.964 --> 00:49.132
But on the whole,

00:46.964 --> 00:49.132
the kid is an angel.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.592
She goes to Yale.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.469
- She'll be out in a minute.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.469
- Right.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.140
I'm sorry, are you, like,

00:54.555 --> 00:57.140
solving something?

00:57.182 --> 00:58.934
- What can I do for you?

00:57.182 --> 00:58.934
- I was just wondering.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.477
Is Rory in the system now?

01:00.519 --> 01:02.604
Because I just remembered

01:00.519 --> 01:02.604
when Sipowicz's son

01:02.646 --> 01:04.523
accidentally got arrested

01:04.565 --> 01:05.691
because he looked

01:04.565 --> 01:05.691
like a drug dealer.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.192
Sipowicz was freaked out

01:07.234 --> 01:08.986
that the son was gonna

01:07.234 --> 01:08.986
wind up in the system.

01:09.028 --> 01:11.363
And, I just wonder, you know,

01:09.028 --> 01:11.363
should I be freaked out?

01:11.405 --> 01:13.114
And also what exactly

01:11.405 --> 01:13.114
is the system?

01:13.156 --> 01:15.242
She's got to go to court. You'll

01:13.156 --> 01:15.242
figure out what's gonna happen.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.077
And am I gonna have

01:15.283 --> 01:17.077
to pay anything?

01:17.118 --> 01:19.162
I mean, bail,

01:17.118 --> 01:19.162
does she need bail?

01:19.204 --> 01:20.205
They're releasing her on a PTA.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.248
A Promise To Appear.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.000
Oh, she will, she will appear.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.292
She might be there before you.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.627
- I won't be there.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.627
- Right.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.462
But she will

01:25.669 --> 01:27.462
'cause she promised.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.964
I'll be over there.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.219
- That's right you can't.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.219
- Why not?

01:34.261 --> 01:35.804
You try it, well,

01:34.261 --> 01:35.804
that's what you get.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.138
Well, this is much nicer

01:37.180 --> 01:38.557
than the last place

01:37.180 --> 01:38.557
we picked him up from.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.850
Yes, we definitely

01:38.599 --> 01:39.850
need to keep this one

01:39.892 --> 01:41.268
in mind for future infractions.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.895
Excuse me, officer,

01:41.309 --> 01:42.895
we were wondering

01:42.937 --> 01:44.855
If one Logan Huntzberger

01:42.937 --> 01:44.855
has been released

01:44.897 --> 01:46.481
from your fine custody yet?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.525
- Nope, have a seat.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.525
- Then, we'll be over here.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.946
And if you have a moment, we'd

01:48.567 --> 01:51.946
like to order some appetizers.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.364
So typical, Logan

01:51.987 --> 01:54.364
would have to get busted

01:54.406 --> 01:55.741
during the one time

01:54.406 --> 01:55.741
I almost got Rosemarie

01:55.783 --> 01:57.076
to agree to go home with me.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.869
It's vintage Huntzberger,

01:57.117 --> 01:58.869
my friend.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.829
- Friday nights end in jail.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.757
- You're here for Rory?

02:09.797 --> 02:11.757
- Yeah.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.300
Oh, well, we would have

02:11.799 --> 02:13.300
taken her home, love.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.509
Just so you know,

02:13.341 --> 02:14.509
she was covered.

Wow, the relief.

- He just got you arrested.

- He did not.

Don't protect him.

I swear, if something doesn't

05:31.957 --> 05:34.209
have a Marc Jacobs label on it.

no parking signs

05:38.213 --> 05:40.548
all up and down the street

05:38.213 --> 05:40.548
here in hopes of clearing

05:40.590 --> 05:43.510
a safe and unobstructed path

05:40.590 --> 05:43.510
through Stars Hollow.

Thank you.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.932
Now, if you notice,

05:46.305 --> 05:48.932
your jeep is currently parked

05:48.974 --> 05:51.350
in what is about to become

05:48.974 --> 05:51.350
a no parking zone.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.728

05:51.392 --> 05:53.728
- As of 10 o'clock tonight.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.064
At 10:01, we will be towing.

Okay, Taylor, it's 9:55.

05:59.358 --> 06:00.401
We still have six minutes.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.486
Yes, but it would be easier

06:01.528 --> 06:02.946
if you would move the car now.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.281
Easy, then anyone could do it.

And I'm a maverick.

following her arrest

for grand-theft boating.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.973
- Tell me what happened.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.973
- I don't know what happened.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.766
I haven't gotten

06:30.015 --> 06:31.766
the details yet.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.102

06:31.808 --> 06:34.102
with a court date on it though.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.777

- I need hand soap.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.238
- What?

06:44.279 --> 06:45.739
Well, she got ink

06:44.279 --> 06:45.739
all over her hands

06:45.780 --> 06:47.282
from the fingerprinting

06:45.780 --> 06:47.282
and I'm out of soap.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.617
- I have soap.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.617

06:49.659 --> 06:51.452
Is there special soap?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.452
'Cause it's special ink.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.247

I mean, of course

06:53.288 --> 06:55.249

06:55.290 --> 06:57.125
normal ink for fingerprinting.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.253
It's supposed to brand you

06:57.167 --> 06:59.253
and humiliate you.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.795
Normal ink wouldn't

06:59.294 --> 07:00.795

07:03.965 --> 07:05.259
I should make a list,

07:03.965 --> 07:05.259
I'm gonna forget things.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.719

Buy soap, okay, buy soap.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.978
still be at the marina.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.231
She's gonna have to pick it up

07:17.020 --> 07:19.231
if it hasn't been impounded!

07:19.273 --> 07:20.565
How do I find out

07:19.273 --> 07:20.565
if it's been impounded?

07:20.607 --> 07:22.401
Um, I'm sure you can

07:20.607 --> 07:22.401
call down there.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.652
God, every ten seconds something

07:22.442 --> 07:24.652

07:24.694 --> 07:26.238
I'm just not prepared for this.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.698
I mean, Rory never

07:26.280 --> 07:28.698
even shoplifted.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.825
Not a candy bar,

07:28.740 --> 07:30.825
not a lipstick.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.953
She forgot to return

07:30.867 --> 07:32.953
a library book once.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.038
And she was so guilty about it

07:32.994 --> 07:35.038
that she grounded herself.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.915
I mean can you imagine

07:36.957 --> 07:39.834
she-she was just sitting there

07:36.957 --> 07:39.834
in her bedroom, yelling at me

What can I do?

07:44.589 --> 07:45.632

Oh, I can make you some burgers.

the end of the world, right?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.516

07:55.558 --> 07:58.145
Young people do stupid things,

07:55.558 --> 07:58.145
I got pregnant.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.314
This is better

07:58.186 --> 08:00.314
because it's not so permanent.

Unless it's on her permanent

08:00.355 --> 08:01.898

08:01.940 --> 08:03.900
- Does that mean she can't vote?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.900
- Oh, I don't think.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.153
I thought I read that if you

08:03.942 --> 08:06.153
commit a felony you can't vote.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.362
- I think that--

08:06.194 --> 08:07.362
- Rory loves to vote.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.905
She switched

08:07.404 --> 08:08.905
her I voted sticker

08:08.947 --> 08:10.573

08:12.909 --> 08:14.202
She has to be able to vote.

Hey, y-you want me to come

08:15.454 --> 08:16.704

08:16.746 --> 08:18.290
No, thanks, she's in the car.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.290
I should go.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.375

- Yes, I know.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.318

08:46.360 --> 08:48.528
and I felt like

08:46.360 --> 08:48.528

About my performance.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.088
And he said that

09:07.130 --> 09:09.007
I was very smart and competent

09:09.049 --> 09:13.887
and would someday make

09:09.049 --> 09:13.887
someone a great assistant.

Uh-huh.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.223

09:16.264 --> 09:18.058

09:27.734 --> 09:28.735

09:29.986 --> 09:31.738

09:29.986 --> 09:31.738
at the paper.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.365

09:31.779 --> 09:33.365
- Oh, God, I hate this guy.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.657
It's not his fault, I mean

If he doesn't think

09:34.699 --> 09:35.992
I can be a journalist

09:36.034 --> 09:37.536
It's probably best

09:36.034 --> 09:37.536
that he tells me before--

09:37.577 --> 09:38.995
Before what?

12:13.732 --> 12:16.403
I threw the troll!

12:17.362 --> 12:20.281
[instrumental music]

12:29.748 --> 12:30.749
(Lorelai)

12:29.748 --> 12:30.749
'Morning.'

12:30.791 --> 12:31.792
God, I feel like

12:30.791 --> 12:31.792
I could sleep

12:31.834 --> 12:33.420
through the entire day.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.547
- Coffee will be ready soon.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.547
- What are you doing?

12:35.589 --> 12:38.341
Well, I'm updating

12:35.589 --> 12:38.341
the refrigerator.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.967
Where did you get that?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.011
Oh, the nice lady at the police

12:40.009 --> 12:42.011
station e-mailed it to me.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.513
I thought

12:42.053 --> 12:43.513
it would look really nice

12:43.555 --> 12:45.223
next to your kindergarten

12:43.555 --> 12:45.223
handprint collage.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.933
'I got you a copy if you're

12:45.265 --> 12:46.933
thinking Christmas cards.'

12:46.974 --> 12:48.476
- Very thoughtful.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.476
- You hungry?

12:48.518 --> 12:51.312
I'm starving. I've had

12:48.518 --> 12:51.312
nothing but donuts for two days.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.148
- Funny.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.148
- Hold on.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.734

12:54.190 --> 12:55.734

12:55.774 --> 12:57.569
I'm really glad

12:55.774 --> 12:57.569
you're enjoying this.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.862
Rory, the penal system

12:57.611 --> 12:59.862
is not something we enjoy.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.948
It's something with a name

12:59.904 --> 13:01.948
that makes us giggle.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.199
I assume

13:01.989 --> 13:03.199
there's pop-tarts?

13:03.241 --> 13:04.951
Now what's in the agenda

13:03.241 --> 13:04.951
for today?

13:04.992 --> 13:06.369
I hear there's a

13:04.992 --> 13:06.369
shipment of plutonium

13:06.411 --> 13:07.662
coming in at the docks.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.456
And I thought

13:07.704 --> 13:09.456
we could dress up as nuns

13:09.497 --> 13:11.374
and I could distract them

13:09.497 --> 13:11.374
with a fake stigmata.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.167
You could shove the plutonium

13:11.416 --> 13:13.167
under your habit and then--

13:13.209 --> 13:15.128
I have to go back to school.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.128
I have one last final, plus--

13:15.169 --> 13:16.296
'Oh! Wait.'

13:24.471 --> 13:27.181
Plus, I have

13:24.471 --> 13:27.181
one last load of stuff

13:27.223 --> 13:29.142
that I need to pack up

13:27.223 --> 13:29.142
and transport back here.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.353
And now I have to hang up.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.353
Visiting hours are over.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.980
Thanks for letting me

13:32.395 --> 13:33.980
borrow the jeep.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.565
I figured, If I didn't give

13:34.021 --> 13:35.565
it to you voluntarily

13:35.607 --> 13:37.275
you'd just heist it anyway.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.735
'This bit's gonna last

13:37.317 --> 13:38.735
for a while, huh?'

13:38.777 --> 13:40.361
Hmm, 20 to life,

13:38.777 --> 13:40.361
with time off

13:40.403 --> 13:42.656
for a well-placed

13:42.697 --> 13:45.158
Don't let the movies fool you,

13:42.697 --> 13:45.158
kiddies. Crime doesn't pay.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.951
Listen, uh, later today,

13:45.199 --> 13:46.951
I'm gonna try

13:46.993 --> 13:48.286
and track us down a lawyer.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.537
I thought I'd call that guy

13:49.579 --> 13:50.747
who got Robert Blake off.

13:50.789 --> 13:51.748
What was his name,

13:50.789 --> 13:51.748
Houdini?

13:52.831 --> 13:54.250
What?

13:54.292 --> 13:56.835
Where are you really

13:54.292 --> 13:56.835
gonna get this lawyer?

13:56.877 --> 13:59.339
The-e-e emergency room

13:56.877 --> 13:59.339
ambulance dispatch center.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.590
You're not gonna tell?

14:00.632 --> 14:02.008
No, I'm not gonna go

14:00.632 --> 14:02.008
through mom and dad.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.593
There's no reason

14:02.049 --> 14:03.593
they need to know about this.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.386
Did I say I'm sorry

14:03.635 --> 14:05.386
in the last five minutes?

14:05.428 --> 14:07.013
Hmm, I think,

14:05.428 --> 14:07.013
not slugging me

14:07.054 --> 14:08.640
when I pulled out

14:07.054 --> 14:08.640
the telephones said it for you.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.057
- I love you, mom.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.057
- I love you, kid.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.519
[telephone ringing]

14:15.563 --> 14:17.607
- Hello?

14:15.563 --> 14:17.607
- 'Uh...hi, is Rory there?'

14:17.649 --> 14:18.899
She just left.

14:17.649 --> 14:18.899
Who's calling?

14:18.941 --> 14:20.652
It's Logan.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.654
- Oh, she's not here.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.654
- I've been trying to get her.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.197
Her phone must be off

14:22.696 --> 14:24.197
or dead or something.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.573
Well, she's heading back

14:24.238 --> 14:25.573
to school.

14:25.615 --> 14:26.949
You can just catch up

14:25.615 --> 14:26.949
with her there.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.743
- 'Yes, I'll do that.'

14:26.991 --> 14:28.743
- Okay, bye.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.203
(Logan)

14:28.785 --> 14:30.203
'Oh, listen,

14:28.785 --> 14:30.203
I'm sorry to call your house.'

14:30.244 --> 14:31.245
I just had this number

14:31.287 --> 14:32.539
and I wanted to talk to Rory.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.541
- It's okay, Logan.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.541
- And listen.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.459
I know you must be really upset

14:34.582 --> 14:36.459
by this whole thing.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.918
But I want you to know

14:36.501 --> 14:37.918
my father's lawyers

14:37.960 --> 14:39.337
are all over

14:37.960 --> 14:39.337
the situation, and--

14:39.379 --> 14:40.380
Hey, you know what?

14:40.421 --> 14:41.631
I think your father's done

14:41.673 --> 14:43.466
just about enough here, okay?

14:43.508 --> 14:44.676
- "Done enough?"

14:43.508 --> 14:44.676
- Yes!

14:44.718 --> 14:46.093
So thank your father

14:44.718 --> 14:46.093
for this.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.554
And I do mean all of this.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.805
But I think I can handle

14:47.595 --> 14:48.805
it from here.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.515
- But..

14:48.847 --> 14:50.515
- His help isn't needed, Logan.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.891
- I've got it.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.891
- Okay, you got it.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.267
Sorry, I was just--

14:53.309 --> 14:55.102
Rory should be back

14:53.309 --> 14:55.102
at school soon.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.689
- Right, sorry to bother you.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.689
- No problem, bye.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.276
- Hey.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.276
- What'd he do?

15:02.318 --> 15:03.778
What?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.739
My father.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.739
What did he do?

15:05.780 --> 15:07.156
Who told you

15:05.780 --> 15:07.156
that he did anything?

15:07.198 --> 15:09.617
I called your house.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.617
I talked to your mom.

15:09.659 --> 15:10.869
Great.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.915
I should have known something

15:14.038 --> 15:15.915
happened the way you showed up

15:15.956 --> 15:17.584
at honor's party like that,

15:15.956 --> 15:17.584
I should have known.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.043
My mother shouldn't

15:17.625 --> 15:19.043
have said anything.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.294
She didn't say

15:19.085 --> 15:20.294
anything specific.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.379
No, what'd she say?

15:21.421 --> 15:22.756
Rory, just tell me

15:21.421 --> 15:22.756
what happened.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.424
It's stupid.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.424
I feel stupid.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.092
- Rory.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.092
- I overreacted.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.887
- You'll think I'm three.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.887
- Tell me.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.766
He just doesn't think

15:28.928 --> 15:32.766
that I've got what it takes

15:32.807 --> 15:34.141
to be a journalist.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.185
He says he knows

15:34.183 --> 15:36.185
when someone has it.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.062
And I apparently

15:36.227 --> 15:38.062
do not have it.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.439
- He said that to you?

15:38.104 --> 15:39.439
- Yeah.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.481
Just like that?

15:40.523 --> 15:42.483
Pretty much.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.777
I knew it, I knew this

15:42.525 --> 15:43.777
was gonna happen.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.486
I didn't want you

15:43.818 --> 15:45.486
to take that internship.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.946
I had to take the internship.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.448
Your father's the top guy

15:46.987 --> 15:48.448
in the business.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.075
My father is a jackass.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.075
He's a bully.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.660
He has zero interest

15:51.117 --> 15:52.660
in people's feelings.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.078
It's always just

15:52.702 --> 15:54.078
say what you feel

15:54.120 --> 15:55.371
right or wrong, who the hell

15:54.120 --> 15:55.371
cares who you hurt?

15:55.413 --> 15:56.831
Whatever, I'm going

15:55.413 --> 15:56.831
over there right now.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.666
- Logan, no.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.666
- You're my girlfriend, Rory.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.042
He should have treated you

15:58.708 --> 16:00.042
better than that.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.544
I don't want

16:00.084 --> 16:01.544
you to say anything.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.588
- I have to.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.588
- Logan, no, please.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.005
I just want to forget this.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.466
I just want it to go away.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.508
And please don't make

16:06.507 --> 16:07.508
a big thing

16:07.550 --> 16:08.676
between you and your dad.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.386
- I don't want that.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.386
- Rory..

16:10.428 --> 16:12.096
Don't put me

16:10.428 --> 16:12.096
in that position, please.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.893
I'm sure he'll give me a crappy

16:15.057 --> 16:16.893
present for my birthday.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.812
Maybe I can pick a fight

16:16.935 --> 16:18.812
with him over that.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.563
- Thank you.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.563
- You should have told me.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.940
I didn't wanna tell you.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.275
Hey, if this relationship

16:22.022 --> 16:24.275
thing is gonna work

16:24.317 --> 16:25.735
then it goes both ways.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.320
You have to tell me

16:25.777 --> 16:27.320
why we're committing a felony

16:27.361 --> 16:28.822
before we do it,

16:27.361 --> 16:28.822
not that that's gonna stop us.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.657
But at least I'll have

16:28.863 --> 16:30.657
all the facts, okay?

16:30.698 --> 16:32.492
- Okay, I'm sorry.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.492
- Come here.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.370
[sighs]

16:37.747 --> 16:39.791
You need

16:37.747 --> 16:39.791
some help packing?

16:39.833 --> 16:43.127
No, I've got

16:39.833 --> 16:43.127
my last final today.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.212
I should go over

16:43.169 --> 16:45.212
my notes.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.089
Okay. Call me after.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.257
I will.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.634
- You good?

16:48.299 --> 16:49.634
- I'm good.

16:50.718 --> 16:51.886
Okay.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.973
Oh, and try and talk

16:51.928 --> 16:54.973
to your mother.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.808
My father's lawyers should

16:55.014 --> 16:56.808
really handle this thing.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.267
They've had a lot

16:56.850 --> 16:58.267
of practice, believe me.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.436
Okay, I'll talk to her.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.108
- Big hole.

17:07.318 --> 17:10.112
- Big hole.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.949
- You signed on the wrong line.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.949
- Uh, sorry.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.159
Cross it out, initial it,

17:12.991 --> 17:15.159
and sign again.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.369
(male #1)

17:15.201 --> 17:16.369
'Big hole!'

17:16.410 --> 17:18.162
What the hell

17:16.410 --> 17:18.162
is wrong with 'em?

17:18.204 --> 17:19.873
Why can't they just let

17:18.204 --> 17:19.873
the bozo in back of him

17:19.914 --> 17:21.833
figure out for himself

17:19.914 --> 17:21.833
there's a big hole there?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.417
You're awfully crabby

17:21.875 --> 17:23.417
for a man

17:23.459 --> 17:25.085
whose business is booming

17:23.459 --> 17:25.085
because of this race.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.254
I don't want this kind

17:25.127 --> 17:27.254
of business. It's too shiny.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.048
I, myself, am finding

17:27.296 --> 17:29.048
the whole thing

17:29.089 --> 17:30.383
rather intoxicating.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.176
Our little town

17:30.424 --> 17:32.176
the sight of a thrilling

17:32.218 --> 17:34.888
international sports event

17:32.218 --> 17:34.888
like this, you have no idea

17:34.929 --> 17:36.597
how much wrangling

17:34.929 --> 17:36.597
it took to get them here.

17:36.639 --> 17:37.807
(male #2)

17:36.639 --> 17:37.807
'Big hole!'

17:37.849 --> 17:40.226
Ah, jeez, I smudged.

17:37.849 --> 17:40.226
He made me smudge.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.062
Cross it out, initial

17:40.267 --> 17:43.062
the smudge then start again.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.105
I lobbied the race

17:43.103 --> 17:45.105
coordinators for weeks.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.817
It was a lot of ouzo

17:45.147 --> 17:47.817
and karaoke

17:47.859 --> 17:49.402
but I bagged our town

17:49.443 --> 17:51.738
the coveted first-stop,

17:49.443 --> 17:51.738
last-stop slot.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.489
Wait, "first-stop,

17:51.779 --> 17:53.489
last-stop," meaning?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.533
They start here today,

17:53.531 --> 17:55.533
circle the state

17:55.575 --> 17:57.117
then end here

17:55.575 --> 17:57.117
later this week.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.912
Every one of them

17:57.159 --> 17:58.912
will be coming back.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.287
(male #3)

17:58.953 --> 18:00.287
'Big hole, big hole!'

18:00.329 --> 18:01.998
Unbelievable.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.332
And don't press

18:02.040 --> 18:03.332
too hard there, buddy.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.375
I don't wanna start

18:03.374 --> 18:04.375
all over again.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.085
That's the last one.

18:06.126 --> 18:09.213
Excellent! Well, I guess

18:06.126 --> 18:09.213
congratulations are in order.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.798
Luke, you just bought yourself

18:09.255 --> 18:10.798
the Twickham house.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.299
Thank you, Taylor.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.928
Now remember, there's a

18:12.341 --> 18:14.928
three-day cooling-off period

18:14.969 --> 18:15.970
meaning you have three days

18:16.012 --> 18:17.013
from today

18:16.012 --> 18:17.013
to change your mind.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.765
I'm not gonna

18:17.055 --> 18:18.765
change my mind.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.892
Well, it's been a pleasure

18:18.806 --> 18:20.892
doing business with you, Luke.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.020
I certainly hope it works out

18:20.934 --> 18:24.020
for you and your future plans.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.522
- 'Big hole!'

18:24.062 --> 18:26.522
- I'm taking my break.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.107
I have 15 minutes.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.609
- No chili?

18:28.148 --> 18:29.609
- Where's Gil?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.318
Tell him we need some chili.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.528
Gil called, his delivery boy

18:31.360 --> 18:32.528
didn't show.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.863
So he had to make

18:32.570 --> 18:33.863
stops on the way.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.489
He said he may

18:33.905 --> 18:35.489
not be able to make it.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.783
Of course he can't make it.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.783
Why should he make it?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.284
I mean, it's only a band

18:36.824 --> 18:38.284
meeting, right?

18:38.325 --> 18:39.702
- Nothing important.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.702
- Oh, my God.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.912
I can taste the potato.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.329
- So?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.329
- 'So I hate potato.'

18:42.371 --> 18:43.497
The chili hides the potato.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.207
- Zach!

18:43.539 --> 18:45.207
- Nice screech.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.751
This, right here, this attitude

18:46.793 --> 18:48.711
it's exactly

18:46.793 --> 18:48.711
what I'm talking about.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.004
What do you mean?

18:48.753 --> 18:50.004
What you're talking about.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.338
You haven't said anything yet.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.882
- I think we have a problem.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.882
- We do?

18:52.924 --> 18:54.258
I just got totally boned

18:54.300 --> 18:56.343
by a 16-year-old

18:54.300 --> 18:56.343
"3 doors down" fan.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.720
My week sucks.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.472
We started

18:57.762 --> 18:59.472
the meeting already, Gil.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.057
Gee, I'm sorry, Lane.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.392
I dropped off the hoagies

19:01.099 --> 19:03.392
as quickly as I could.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.019
Next time I won't wait

19:03.434 --> 19:05.019
for the money

19:05.061 --> 19:06.813
and my kid can just

19:05.061 --> 19:06.813
paint himself silver

19:06.854 --> 19:08.272
and do the robot

19:06.854 --> 19:08.272
on the street corner

19:08.314 --> 19:09.398
for tuition fees.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.067
What's going on here?

19:11.109 --> 19:13.152
- Are we breaking up?

19:11.109 --> 19:13.152
- What?

19:13.193 --> 19:14.862
Oh, you mean the band.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.698
Okay, cool, wow, go on.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.283
We're not breaking up.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.283
Are we breaking up?

19:19.325 --> 19:20.618
Well, I don't know,

19:19.325 --> 19:20.618
it just seems to me that

19:20.660 --> 19:21.911
lately the band

19:20.660 --> 19:21.911
doesn't seem to be

19:21.953 --> 19:23.496
as important to everyone

19:21.953 --> 19:23.496
as it used to be.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.331
- Don't agree.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.331
- 'We hardly practice anymore.'

19:25.372 --> 19:27.166
Everyone else has all these

19:25.372 --> 19:27.166
other things to do.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.127
There were clothes

19:27.207 --> 19:29.127
on my drums this morning.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.837
Sorry, after I woolite

19:29.168 --> 19:30.837
that sweater

19:30.878 --> 19:32.713
I have to lay it out flat

19:30.878 --> 19:32.713
or else it loses it's shape.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.214
(Gil)

19:32.755 --> 19:34.214
'Well, Lane, relax.'

19:34.256 --> 19:35.842
Things have just

19:34.256 --> 19:35.842
been a little crazy lately.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.510
Oh, that reminds me,

19:35.883 --> 19:37.510
I got offered

19:37.551 --> 19:39.178
that full-time

19:37.551 --> 19:39.178
receptionist job today.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.513
Really?

19:40.554 --> 19:41.764
Welcome to the grind,

19:40.554 --> 19:41.764
my friend.

19:41.806 --> 19:42.807
They're giving me a raise

19:42.849 --> 19:44.100
and I get to keep the blazer.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.309
Awesome blazer!

19:45.351 --> 19:46.602
I'm sorry,

19:45.351 --> 19:46.602
does anyone else see

19:46.644 --> 19:47.979
what's going on here?

19:48.021 --> 19:51.107
Brian's talking about

19:48.021 --> 19:51.107
taking a full-time job.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.942
The<i> band's</i> supposed

19:51.149 --> 19:52.942
to be a full-time job.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.234
- Lane.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.234
- No. No, "Lane."

19:54.276 --> 19:56.154
You have your

19:54.276 --> 19:56.154
Americana banjo band

19:56.195 --> 19:57.822
and you have Century 21

19:57.864 --> 20:00.783
and you have a really stupid hat

19:57.864 --> 20:00.783
on, and what do I have, huh?

20:00.825 --> 20:02.242
According to my mother,

20:00.825 --> 20:02.242
I'm going to hell for this.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.410
<i>That's</i> commitment,

20:02.284 --> 20:03.410
my friends.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.704
Eternal damnation is what

20:04.745 --> 20:06.205
I'm risking

20:04.745 --> 20:06.205
for my rock 'n' roll.

20:06.246 --> 20:10.001
Lane, calm down.

20:06.246 --> 20:10.001
We all care about the band.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.627
So I'm just imagining

20:10.043 --> 20:11.627
all of this?

20:13.963 --> 20:15.297
I think we need

20:13.963 --> 20:15.297
to play more.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.591
We've played every club

20:15.339 --> 20:17.591
around here 100 times.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.093
Well, then maybe

20:17.633 --> 20:19.093
we need to tour.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.554
Tours are rough, Lane.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.554
They have to be planned.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.014
Venues must be booked.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.850
You need publicity,

20:23.056 --> 20:25.850
transportation, money.

20:25.892 --> 20:26.893
Well we have

20:25.892 --> 20:26.893
to do something.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.602
(male #4)

20:26.934 --> 20:28.602
'Big hole!'

20:28.644 --> 20:30.021
That's it.

20:31.856 --> 20:32.857
- 'Big bat!

20:31.856 --> 20:32.857
- 'Big bat!'

20:32.899 --> 20:34.441
(Luke)

20:32.899 --> 20:34.441
'Big bat!'

20:34.483 --> 20:36.777
- 600 lunges every night.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.777
- Impressive.

20:36.819 --> 20:37.904
(Lorelai)

20:36.819 --> 20:37.904
'Thank you!'

20:37.945 --> 20:39.363
We are booked, booked, booked.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.407
I now love bike riders

20:39.405 --> 20:41.407
so much that from now on

20:41.448 --> 20:42.909
when driving,

20:41.448 --> 20:42.909
I will no longer consider

20:42.950 --> 20:44.410
how many points I'd get

20:42.950 --> 20:44.410
if I took them out.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.037
- What's this?

20:44.451 --> 20:46.037
- This is for you, apparently.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.414
[gasps]

20:46.079 --> 20:48.414
A present. I love presents.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.166
I wonder who could it be from.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.210
"Lorelai, a little something

20:50.208 --> 20:52.210
to make the trip over

20:52.251 --> 20:55.213
to the Durham group a bit

20:52.251 --> 20:55.213
more fun, Mike Armstrong."

20:55.254 --> 20:56.756
Thank you,

20:55.254 --> 20:56.756
Mike Armstrong.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.925
That is the man

20:56.797 --> 20:58.925
who wants to buy the inn, no?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.801
Oh, my God.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.801
Look at all this stuff.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.054
Travel soap, travel candles,

21:00.843 --> 21:03.054
a travel blanket

21:03.096 --> 21:05.223
cashmere travel pillow,

21:03.096 --> 21:05.223
cashmere socks.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.933
Oh, my God! I've been

21:05.264 --> 21:06.933
wanting to try this.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.768
This is the Lumiere youth serum.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.978
Apparently, you put this on

21:08.809 --> 21:10.978
before you get on a plane

21:11.020 --> 21:13.397
and by the time you get off,

21:11.020 --> 21:13.397
you're Dakota Fanning.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.982
Michel, take something.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.982
What do you want?

21:15.024 --> 21:16.234
The memory of those bikers

21:16.275 --> 21:17.777
poking each other

21:16.275 --> 21:17.777
in the buttocks

21:17.818 --> 21:19.612
eternal sunshined,

21:17.818 --> 21:19.612
out of my mind.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.822
Come on, Michel. Take something.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.822
You love products.

21:21.864 --> 21:22.949
You're going to do it.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.324
- Aren't you?

21:22.990 --> 21:24.324
- Do what?

21:24.366 --> 21:26.368
You're going to sell the inn

21:24.366 --> 21:26.368
to Mike Armstrong.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.828
Ooh, Euros. Cool.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.705
You're going to sell

21:27.870 --> 21:29.705
the inn to Mike Armstrong.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.665
And then you're going to go off

21:29.747 --> 21:31.665
and have a wonderful life.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.084
And I'm going

21:31.707 --> 21:33.084
to be unemployed.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.669
Very attractive asset

21:33.126 --> 21:35.669
on the dating scene.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.464
You know, we have our own

21:35.711 --> 21:38.464
little section on Match.com.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.841
Michel, stop it. I'm probably

21:38.505 --> 21:40.841
not gonna take the deal.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.593
- You're not?

21:40.883 --> 21:42.593
- This is my inn.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.928
I love it here.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.679
It's just fun being wooed,

21:43.970 --> 21:45.679
you know?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.140
Having someone

21:45.721 --> 21:47.140
want you enough

21:47.181 --> 21:49.183
to send you prescriptives

21:47.181 --> 21:49.183
misting lotion.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.351
Fine. If you say so.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.853
Oh, hey, did the handyman

21:51.393 --> 21:52.853
get here yet?

21:52.895 --> 21:54.438
That loose banister's

21:52.895 --> 21:54.438
making me nervous.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.149
He has not come.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.149
Should I call him again?

21:56.190 --> 21:58.025
No, forget it.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.025
I'll call Luke.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.944
He'll come fix it. And all

21:58.067 --> 21:59.944
it'll cost me is my honor.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.988
Oh. what a lovely arrangement

21:59.986 --> 22:01.988
you two have.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.866
And the countdown

22:03.948 --> 22:05.866
continues.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.327
25 more minutes, people.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.580
Can you stand the excitement?

22:08.368 --> 22:11.580
I know I can't.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.294
[instrumental music]

22:32.434 --> 22:33.769
I've only got 10 minutes.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.769
What do you need?

22:33.811 --> 22:35.104
Oh, the banister's

22:33.811 --> 22:35.104
loose upstairs.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.147
Okay.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.397
The window in room 3 is stuck.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.691
The barn door is off

22:37.439 --> 22:38.691
the tracks again.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.234
And, ooh, hey

22:38.732 --> 22:40.234
did you bring your jackhammer?

22:40.276 --> 22:41.902
Did you hear the part

22:40.276 --> 22:41.902
about, I've only got 10 minutes?

22:41.944 --> 22:43.737
- Window in room 3 is stuck.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.737
- Let's go.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.281
But if you fix it

22:43.779 --> 22:45.281
really quickly

22:45.323 --> 22:46.949
the banister is right

22:45.323 --> 22:46.949
on your way back down.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.285
So really, you might as well

22:46.991 --> 22:49.285
take a look at that, too.

22:49.327 --> 22:50.410
What's all this stuff?

22:50.452 --> 22:51.704
That is my big, fancy present.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.747
- From whom?

22:51.745 --> 22:53.747
- From Mike Armstrong.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.373
Who the hell's

22:53.789 --> 22:55.373
Mike Armstrong?

22:55.415 --> 22:58.044
He's my other lover.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.044
He owns a diner in Woodberry.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.128
I didn't want you to find

22:58.085 --> 22:59.128
out this way, but..

22:59.170 --> 23:00.880
"The Durham group."

23:00.921 --> 23:02.548
Yeah, they are the hotel chain

23:00.921 --> 23:02.548
who wants to buy the inn.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.382
What are they sending

23:02.589 --> 23:04.382
you gifts for?

23:04.424 --> 23:06.010
Well, either they're just

23:04.424 --> 23:06.010
proportionally worried

23:06.052 --> 23:07.803
about my cuticles

23:06.052 --> 23:07.803
or they can't live without me

23:07.845 --> 23:09.347
and they're begging me

23:07.845 --> 23:09.347
to accept their offer.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.723
- To buy the inn?

23:09.387 --> 23:10.723
- Yeah.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.266
They've been after me

23:10.764 --> 23:12.266
ever since that meeting.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.893
- What meeting?

23:12.308 --> 23:13.893
- Meeting with Mike Armstrong.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.602
I didn't know you had a meeting

23:13.934 --> 23:15.602
with Mike Armstrong.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.979
- Yes, you did.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.979
- No, I didn't.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.022
Yes you did,

23:17.021 --> 23:18.022
You<i> told</i> me to have

23:18.064 --> 23:19.481
a meeting with Mike Armstrong.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.524
I know but you never

23:19.523 --> 23:20.524
said anything

23:20.566 --> 23:21.984
so I figured it went away.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.278
Well, I had a meeting

23:22.026 --> 23:24.278
with Mike Armstrong.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.364
- And?

23:25.363 --> 23:26.364
- 'And what?'

23:26.404 --> 23:27.698
And what happened?

23:27.740 --> 23:29.616
Uh, nothing. He talked.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.616
I listened.

23:29.658 --> 23:30.743
I told him

23:29.658 --> 23:30.743
I'd think about it.

23:30.784 --> 23:31.952
- Think about it?

23:30.784 --> 23:31.952
- Yeah.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.204
About selling the inn,

23:31.994 --> 23:33.204
and then after

23:33.246 --> 23:34.705
you sell the inn, then what?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.332
I'd be, like, a consultant

23:34.747 --> 23:36.332
for their company.

23:36.374 --> 23:38.542
- Is that what you want?

23:36.374 --> 23:38.542
- I don't know.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.002
Are you gonna take

23:38.584 --> 23:40.002
this job?

23:40.044 --> 23:41.962
Probably not.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.962
I'm still mulling.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.881
Mulling?

23:42.004 --> 23:43.881
You're still mulling?

23:43.923 --> 23:45.174
She's still mulling.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.717
- Why are you so upset?

23:45.216 --> 23:46.717
- I'm not upset.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.969
I just can't believe

23:46.759 --> 23:48.969
you're still mulling.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.180
I mean, you're seriously

23:49.011 --> 23:51.180
considering

23:51.222 --> 23:52.472
selling the inn

23:51.222 --> 23:52.472
and taking this job.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.807
I mean, where

23:52.514 --> 23:53.807
is their office, anyway?

23:53.849 --> 23:55.101
They've got a bunch of them.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.643
I don't know

23:55.142 --> 23:56.643
where exactly I'd be.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.354
- Well, shouldn't you ask?

23:56.685 --> 23:58.354
- Hello? Mulling.

23:58.396 --> 23:59.897
I mean they could

23:58.396 --> 23:59.897
send you anywhere.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.357
- Luke!

23:59.939 --> 24:01.357
- Then there's all that travel.

24:01.399 --> 24:02.942
- There's travel right?

24:01.399 --> 24:02.942
- Yes.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.318
No, I-I don't know.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.778
What are you freaking

24:04.360 --> 24:05.778
out about?

24:05.819 --> 24:08.114
- Well, what about the kids?

24:05.819 --> 24:08.114
- What kids?

24:10.157 --> 24:12.952
Uh, nothing,

24:10.157 --> 24:12.952
never mind, forget it.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.954
- I'm gonna fix the window.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.954
- Luke..

24:14.995 --> 24:17.123
Room three, got it.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.257
Mama, it's me Lane.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.092
(Mrs. Kim)

24:26.299 --> 24:28.092
'Over here in the

24:26.299 --> 24:28.092
20 percent off section.'

24:29.009 --> 24:30.636
Am I disturbing you?

24:30.677 --> 24:32.930
No, but it is past

24:30.677 --> 24:32.930
their bedtime.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.265
That was joke.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.350
- You're in a good mood.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.350
- I had a good day.

24:36.392 --> 24:37.475
You sell a lot of things?

24:37.517 --> 24:38.685
You would like

24:37.517 --> 24:38.685
to see my receipts?

24:38.727 --> 24:40.396
- No.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.396
- My inventory reports?

24:40.438 --> 24:42.398
No, mom, I was just

24:40.438 --> 24:42.398
making small talk.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.774
You would like some tea?

24:43.816 --> 24:46.777
No, I just wanna

24:43.816 --> 24:46.777
tell you something.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.487
Alright.

24:49.529 --> 24:51.449
Tell me something.

24:54.118 --> 24:57.037
It looks like the band

24:54.118 --> 24:57.037
may be breaking up.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.372
We've hit a rut.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.749
We can't get enough gigs

24:58.414 --> 25:00.749
to get any momentum

25:00.791 --> 25:03.085
and, I don't know,

25:00.791 --> 25:03.085
it's just not working.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.544
I see.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.547
I think I may need

25:04.586 --> 25:07.547
to move back home.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.175
I realize that

25:07.589 --> 25:09.175
if you allow me to do that

25:09.216 --> 25:12.052
then I will have to abide

25:09.216 --> 25:12.052
by any rules you feel necessary.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.805
I also anticipate the words

25:12.094 --> 25:14.805
Seventh-Day Adventist college

25:14.847 --> 25:17.350
will come up,

25:14.847 --> 25:17.350
so...I'll go shopping

25:17.391 --> 25:20.269
for some Peter Pan

25:17.391 --> 25:20.269
collared shirts tomorrow.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.229
No more band?

25:22.271 --> 25:23.689
No more band.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.193
You are not

25:25.065 --> 25:27.193
the daughter I raised!

25:27.234 --> 25:28.235
What?

25:28.277 --> 25:30.946
Kims don't give up.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.494
Sorry, sorry, sorry,

25:34.492 --> 25:36.494
the inn was swamped.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.662
These bikers are like rabbits

25:36.534 --> 25:38.662
who don't eat carrots.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.456
- Too much sugar.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.456
- Hmm, sugar.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.540
The fitness craze

25:40.498 --> 25:42.540
is completely lost on us.

25:42.582 --> 25:45.127
- I'm starving.

25:42.582 --> 25:45.127
- Me too.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.962
Hey, so how'd your

25:45.169 --> 25:46.962
final go?

25:47.004 --> 25:48.672
- It went well.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.672
- Yeah?

25:48.714 --> 25:50.590
- And you finished packing?

25:48.714 --> 25:50.590
- All packed, all boxed.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.884
I just have one more

25:50.632 --> 25:51.884
trip to school and home

25:51.925 --> 25:53.302
and then I'm done.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.095
It's gonna be nice

25:53.344 --> 25:55.095
to have you home for a while.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.389
Oh, I'm glad you feel that way.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.431
Yeah, the place hasn't

25:56.430 --> 25:57.431
had a decent dusting

25:57.473 --> 25:58.974
since you left.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.184
Hey do you think

25:59.016 --> 26:00.184
today's the day

26:00.226 --> 26:01.394
we're finally going to go

26:01.435 --> 26:03.020
through all 12 layers

26:01.435 --> 26:03.020
of the 12 layer

26:03.062 --> 26:04.480
German chocolate cake?

26:04.522 --> 26:06.606
The bikers have demonstrated

26:04.522 --> 26:06.606
the importance

26:06.648 --> 26:08.150
of challenging oneself.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.110
Mom.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.653
Rory.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.988
I have to tell you

26:11.695 --> 26:12.988
something.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.740
Okay, wow, there's something

26:13.030 --> 26:14.740
about Weston's.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.825
It's always the place

26:14.781 --> 26:16.825
where we talk.

26:16.867 --> 26:17.868
We could go

26:16.867 --> 26:17.868
somewhere else.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.537
No, no, no,

26:17.910 --> 26:19.537
tell me.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.500
I've decided

26:24.542 --> 26:28.045
that I'm not going back

26:24.542 --> 26:28.045
to Yale next year.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.463
I'm sorry, I don't think

26:28.087 --> 26:29.463
I heard you correctly.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.715
I'm not going back

26:29.505 --> 26:31.715
to Yale next year.

26:31.757 --> 26:32.758
But why?

26:32.799 --> 26:34.301
Because I'm not sure

26:34.343 --> 26:36.011
that it's the right place

26:34.343 --> 26:36.011
for me.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.679
And I'm not exactly sure

26:37.721 --> 26:38.972
what I want to do

26:37.721 --> 26:38.972
with my life and..

26:39.014 --> 26:40.099
Since when are you not sure

26:40.140 --> 26:41.934
what you wanna do

26:40.140 --> 26:41.934
with your life?

26:41.975 --> 26:43.143
You've known what you wanted

26:41.975 --> 26:43.143
to do with your life

26:43.185 --> 26:45.187
since you were three,

26:43.185 --> 26:45.187
be a journalist.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.730
Maybe not.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.316
Oh, this is

26:46.772 --> 26:49.316
about Mitchum Huntzberger.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.484
No, it's not.

26:50.526 --> 26:51.902
Rory, honey, I know that

26:50.526 --> 26:51.902
what he said

26:51.944 --> 26:53.320
hurt you,

26:51.944 --> 26:53.320
and that shook you up

26:53.362 --> 26:54.572
and you lost your confidence.

26:54.612 --> 26:55.989
but that was just

26:54.612 --> 26:55.989
one man's opinion.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.741
It has nothing to do

26:56.031 --> 26:57.741
with what he said to me.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.410
And Mitchum Huntzberger

26:59.452 --> 27:01.370
happens to be the top

26:59.452 --> 27:01.370
newspaper guy in the country.

27:01.412 --> 27:02.871
So what?

27:02.913 --> 27:04.248
So if you're going to get

27:02.913 --> 27:04.248
one man's opinion

27:04.290 --> 27:05.416
he's the one man you get.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.624
You're not thinking,

27:05.458 --> 27:06.624
this is the man

27:06.666 --> 27:08.210
who doesn't want

27:06.666 --> 27:08.210
you to marry Logan.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.669
That wasn't him.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.671
It was Logan's mother

27:09.711 --> 27:11.671
and his grandfather.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.090
And you really think

27:11.713 --> 27:13.090
he's okay with it?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.508
I mean his whole family

27:13.132 --> 27:14.508
looks at you

27:14.550 --> 27:15.675
and sees Anna Nicole Smith.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.843
And they tell you that

27:15.717 --> 27:16.843
to your face.

27:16.885 --> 27:17.970
But he thinks you're swell.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.305
And wants to pay

27:18.011 --> 27:19.305
for the honeymoon.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.764
That's not why he said

27:19.346 --> 27:20.764
what he said.

27:20.806 --> 27:21.807
He's messing with your mind.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.142
He has so many motives

27:23.183 --> 27:25.018
that have nothing to do

27:23.183 --> 27:25.018
with your abilities.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.437
That's not true.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.397
He said I can't do it,

27:26.479 --> 27:28.397
so I can't do it.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.232
Why are you so willing

27:28.439 --> 27:30.232
to believe this guy?

27:30.274 --> 27:31.984
- Logan agrees with him.

27:30.274 --> 27:31.984
- He said that?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.486
He told you he agrees

27:32.025 --> 27:33.486
with his father?

27:33.527 --> 27:35.821
Because if that's so,

27:33.527 --> 27:35.821
he-he's a fantastic boyfriend.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.823
- Really, quite a catch.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.823
- No, he didn't say it.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.116
- I could just tell.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.116
- How?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.493
I could tell.

27:40.534 --> 27:42.328
He ranted about his father

27:40.534 --> 27:42.328
being a jerk

27:42.369 --> 27:43.703
and speaking his mind

27:43.745 --> 27:45.372
but he never said

27:43.745 --> 27:45.372
that he was wrong.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.040
Rory, come on.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.040
What kind of logic is that?

27:47.082 --> 27:49.168
It doesn't matter.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.168
This isn't about that.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.919
I told you,

27:49.209 --> 27:50.919
I just need some time.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.464
- You're making a mistake.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.464
- No, I'm not. This is normal.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.133
College kids take

27:53.506 --> 27:56.133
breaks like this all the time.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.884
You didn't go to college,

27:56.175 --> 27:57.884
so you don't understand.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.303
No, I didn't go

27:57.926 --> 27:59.303
to college.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.846
I wasn't lucky enough

27:59.345 --> 28:00.846
to go to college.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.431
Trust me.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.431
This is very normal.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.642
- No! You are not quitting Yale.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.642
- Yes, I am.

28:04.682 --> 28:06.226
'You're acting

28:04.682 --> 28:06.226
incredibly immature.'

28:06.268 --> 28:07.978
And I know

28:06.268 --> 28:07.978
it's because you're hurt

28:08.020 --> 28:09.104
but you've got to get a grip.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.523
This is too important.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.399
You've been working

28:10.564 --> 28:12.399
toward Yale your whole life.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.361
No. I was working

28:12.441 --> 28:15.361
toward Harvard my whole life.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.279
Okay fine. Then go to Harvard.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.279
That's cool.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.822
I don't wanna go to Harvard.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.782
Then go to Princeton

28:18.864 --> 28:20.782
or Stanford or Columbia.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.117
I want time off.

28:22.159 --> 28:23.494
If you leave Yale now

28:22.159 --> 28:23.494
you'll never go back

28:23.536 --> 28:24.786
you'll lose momentum.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.163
Momentum toward what?

28:26.205 --> 28:27.414
All I've been doing is working

28:27.456 --> 28:28.706
toward being a journalist.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.083
I'm not going

28:28.748 --> 28:30.083
to be a journalist

28:30.125 --> 28:32.710
so what momentum

28:30.125 --> 28:32.710
am I losing, exactly?

28:32.752 --> 28:33.753
You don't wanna be

28:32.752 --> 28:33.753
a journalist, fine.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.130
I don't care about that.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.674
But you stay in school.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.674
You take some classes.

28:36.714 --> 28:38.509
You figure out

28:36.714 --> 28:38.509
what you<i> do</i> wanna be.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.302
That's not

28:38.551 --> 28:40.302
what Yale is for.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.679
That's what<i> college </i>

28:40.344 --> 28:41.679
is for.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.804
- Yale's expensive.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.804
- Are you paying?

28:42.846 --> 28:44.139
'I don't wanna do that.'

28:44.181 --> 28:45.474
I don't wanna wander

28:44.181 --> 28:45.474
around a school

28:45.516 --> 28:46.600
where everyone else is focused

28:46.642 --> 28:47.685
and-and working toward something

28:47.726 --> 28:49.019
and I'm just floating.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.688
So what's the great master plan

28:49.061 --> 28:50.688
then, huh ?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.272
You're gonna move back home,

28:50.729 --> 28:52.272
live in your room

28:52.314 --> 28:53.524
work part time at the bookstore?

28:53.566 --> 28:55.067
Forget it.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.067
Not an option.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.902
- I'll figure it out.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.902
- I'm not hungry.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.987
Look, I'm not going back.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.987
I just wanted you to know.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.531
Message sent.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.118
Hey, Luke, you were looking

29:03.617 --> 29:05.118
for Taylor?

29:05.160 --> 29:06.161
Yeah.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.871
Go, Connecticut!

29:07.913 --> 29:09.498
He's right outside.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.584
I'll be back

29:09.540 --> 29:11.584
in a minute.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.545
[instrumental music]

29:19.841 --> 29:22.135
[screaming]

29:22.177 --> 29:23.512
Hey, Taylor.

29:23.554 --> 29:24.763
Uh, hello, Luke.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.014
You said I had three days,

29:24.804 --> 29:26.014
right?

29:26.056 --> 29:27.057
- Three?

29:26.056 --> 29:27.057
- For the house.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.225
Three days to back out.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.560
Well, I didn't say that.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.560
The law did.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.770
Fine, whoever said it,

29:29.602 --> 29:31.770
I want out.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.355
- What?

29:31.811 --> 29:33.355
- Forget the house.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.190
Forget the whole damn thing.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.858
I don't need it anymore.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.737
Well...Luke.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.869
I have a lunch

29:45.576 --> 29:47.869
with Sonny Kingsman today.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.622
And then I have to stop by

29:47.911 --> 29:49.622
the club at 4:00

29:49.663 --> 29:51.582
some of the girls are having

29:49.663 --> 29:51.582
a little impromptu

29:51.624 --> 29:53.584
birthday cocktail

29:51.624 --> 29:53.584
with Mellie Rutgers.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.419
Though the last thing Mellie

29:53.626 --> 29:55.419
needs is another excuse

29:55.461 --> 29:56.420
for a midday cocktail.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.215
I can stop by the cleaners

29:58.171 --> 30:00.215
on my way home if you want

30:00.257 --> 30:02.593
to have something pressed

30:00.257 --> 30:02.593
for your trip this weekend.

30:03.843 --> 30:04.844
Uh-huh.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.057
And then after the cleaners,

30:07.222 --> 30:09.057
I thought I'd run off

30:09.099 --> 30:11.602
with Marshall,

30:09.099 --> 30:11.602
the golf instructor at the club.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.104
Do you think you could manage

30:11.644 --> 30:14.104
to get your own dinner tonight?

30:14.146 --> 30:16.189
Uh, that'll be fine, Emily.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.232
[doorbell dings]

30:17.274 --> 30:18.275
Oh, I wonder who that could be

30:18.317 --> 30:19.568
first thing in the morning?

30:19.610 --> 30:20.860
Perhaps it's Marshall,

30:19.610 --> 30:20.860
the golf instructor

30:20.902 --> 30:22.738
unable to wait

30:20.902 --> 30:22.738
until after Mellie's party

30:22.780 --> 30:25.115
to have you

30:22.780 --> 30:25.115
I know I couldn't.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.908
You do surprise me,

30:25.157 --> 30:26.908
Richard Gilmore.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.619
Hey, um, I'm sorry

30:28.661 --> 30:29.662
to interrupt your breakfast.

30:29.703 --> 30:30.704
Lorelai.

30:30.746 --> 30:31.747
Uh, I need to talk

30:31.789 --> 30:32.914
to you guys

30:31.789 --> 30:32.914
about something.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.207
- Is everything alright?

30:32.956 --> 30:34.207
- Well, I..

30:34.249 --> 30:35.668
Sit down, Lorelai.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.085
Davida, bring a coffee cup

30:35.709 --> 30:37.085
for my daughter.

30:37.127 --> 30:38.337
I'm gonna have to call

30:37.127 --> 30:38.337
the office

30:38.378 --> 30:39.463
if this is gonna take long.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.714
No, dad, it won't.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.675
I just, um..

30:42.716 --> 30:44.426
I need your help.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.136
Call the office, Richard.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.305
(Lorelai)

30:46.178 --> 30:48.305
'No, dad, I promise

30:46.178 --> 30:48.305
it'll be quick.'

30:48.347 --> 30:50.474
- Rory's quitting Yale.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.474
- What?

30:50.516 --> 30:52.309
- What are you talking about?

30:50.516 --> 30:52.309
- Thank you.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.811
What do you mean

30:52.351 --> 30:53.811
Rory's quitting Yale?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.646
Why would you joke

30:53.852 --> 30:55.646
about something like that?

30:55.688 --> 30:56.772
What makes you think

30:55.688 --> 30:56.772
I'm joking?

30:56.814 --> 30:58.940
Because Rory would never

30:56.814 --> 30:58.940
quit Yale.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.275
This must be one of your bits.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.943
You scare us

31:00.317 --> 31:01.943
with something horrible

31:01.985 --> 31:03.403
like Rory's quitting college

31:03.445 --> 31:04.863
and then after we have

31:03.445 --> 31:04.863
a heart attack

31:04.904 --> 31:06.114
you tell us

31:04.904 --> 31:06.114
you were just kidding.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.574
You're having

31:06.156 --> 31:07.574
a sex change operation.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.118
Mom, dad, I'm not having

31:07.616 --> 31:10.118
a sex change operation.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.328
I don't understand this.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.912
Rory's doing beautifully

31:11.370 --> 31:12.912
at school.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.206
Why would she want to leave?

31:14.247 --> 31:16.709
Okay, look,

31:14.247 --> 31:16.709
I know you love Logan

31:16.750 --> 31:19.127
and the Huntzbergers

31:16.750 --> 31:19.127
and you already have

31:19.169 --> 31:21.338
the wedding invitations

31:19.169 --> 31:21.338
printed and ready to go.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.423
But I have to tell you,

31:21.380 --> 31:23.423
these are not good people.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.466
Meaning what?

31:24.508 --> 31:26.051
Logan's mother and grandfather

31:26.092 --> 31:28.970
attacked Rory at that dinner

31:26.092 --> 31:28.970
they invited her to.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.764
They told her

31:29.012 --> 31:30.764
she wasn't good enough

31:30.806 --> 31:32.766
to marry into

31:30.806 --> 31:32.766
the Huntzberger family

31:32.808 --> 31:34.934
and she wasn't

31:32.808 --> 31:34.934
who they wanted for Logan.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.102
Not good enough?

31:36.144 --> 31:37.187
Then Mitchum Huntzberger

31:37.229 --> 31:38.438
gave Rory that internship

31:38.480 --> 31:40.148
theoretically to make up

31:38.480 --> 31:40.148
for that evening

31:40.190 --> 31:42.275
he let her work for a while,

31:40.190 --> 31:42.275
he built her up

31:42.317 --> 31:43.652
and then he clobbered her.

31:43.694 --> 31:45.445
'He told her she doesn't

31:43.694 --> 31:45.445
have what it takes'

31:45.487 --> 31:47.364
to be a journalist,

31:45.487 --> 31:47.364
and she needs to find

31:47.406 --> 31:48.699
something else to do

31:47.406 --> 31:48.699
with her life.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.200
What?

31:50.242 --> 31:51.493
This happened

31:50.242 --> 31:51.493
on Friday night, mom.

31:51.535 --> 31:52.578
That's why Rory

31:51.535 --> 31:52.578
wasn't at dinner.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.704
She was devastated.

31:53.746 --> 31:54.788
Then she went to find Logan

31:54.830 --> 31:56.081
at the yacht club

31:56.122 --> 31:57.416
and the two

31:56.122 --> 31:57.416
of them stole a yacht.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.792
No, no, stop it.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.792
Stop it right now.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.335
They were arrested

31:58.834 --> 32:00.335
and I had to pick

32:00.377 --> 32:02.796
Rory up from the Bridgeport

32:00.377 --> 32:02.796
police department.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.590
'Ever since she got involved

32:02.838 --> 32:04.590
with these people'

32:04.631 --> 32:06.258
things have been bad.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.802
She's up and she's down and she

32:06.299 --> 32:08.802
should be stronger than this

32:08.844 --> 32:10.470
I know but she's young

32:10.512 --> 32:12.806
and she's Rory

32:10.512 --> 32:12.806
and she's come so far

32:12.848 --> 32:15.141
she's worked so hard, I just

32:12.848 --> 32:15.141
don't want her to lose this.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.312
What do you want us to do?

32:19.354 --> 32:21.106
(Lorelai)

32:19.354 --> 32:21.106
'I've already told her

32:19.354 --> 32:21.106
that just coming home'

32:21.147 --> 32:23.734
and bumming around

32:21.147 --> 32:23.734
Stars Hollow is not an option.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.485
And I was thinking,

32:23.776 --> 32:25.485
Friday night at dinner

32:25.527 --> 32:28.029
we could triple team her.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.322
'I bet between

32:28.071 --> 32:29.322
the three of us'

32:29.364 --> 32:31.366
we could knock

32:29.364 --> 32:31.366
some sense into her

32:31.408 --> 32:33.410
but I really need the two of you

32:31.408 --> 32:33.410
to back me up on this.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.621
Well, Of course, we'll back you

32:33.452 --> 32:35.621
up. This is<i> not</i> happening.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.915
How much trouble is she

32:35.662 --> 32:37.915
in with this yacht incident?

32:37.956 --> 32:40.375
- She's gonna need a lawyer.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.375
- I'll call Charlie Newman.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.752
Are we sure we wanna wait

32:40.417 --> 32:41.752
until Friday?

32:41.794 --> 32:43.587
Should we confront her now?

32:43.629 --> 32:45.213
No, I think we should give her

32:43.629 --> 32:45.213
a chance to cool off a little.

32:45.255 --> 32:47.758
Maybe some time

32:45.255 --> 32:47.758
will make her more receptive.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.093
I agree with Lorelai.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.093
Give the girl some time.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.345
Alright. Friday night it is.

32:52.387 --> 32:55.265
Thank you.

32:52.387 --> 32:55.265
Just...thank you.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.226
I should get going.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.226
Dad has to get to work.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.561
Would you like

32:58.268 --> 32:59.561
something to eat?

32:59.603 --> 33:02.355
No. I just got

32:59.603 --> 33:02.355
everything I need.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.115
Davida, can you

33:10.029 --> 33:12.115
come here, please?

33:13.867 --> 33:15.619
Look at these shoes

33:13.867 --> 33:15.619
and tell me

33:15.661 --> 33:18.288
if these look like

33:15.661 --> 33:18.288
the same color to you.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.456
They're supposed to be

33:18.330 --> 33:19.456
the same color.

33:19.498 --> 33:20.874
They were bought

33:19.498 --> 33:20.874
at the same time

33:20.916 --> 33:22.835
'they've been residing

33:20.916 --> 33:22.835
in the same box.'

33:22.876 --> 33:24.837
However, on closer examination

33:24.878 --> 33:26.379
one of them seems

33:24.878 --> 33:26.379
a little faded.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.840
What do you think?

33:27.881 --> 33:29.299
'What's the matter?'

33:29.341 --> 33:31.510
I was just asking

33:29.341 --> 33:31.510
your opinion.

33:31.551 --> 33:32.803
Davida, stop that shaking

33:31.551 --> 33:32.803
right now.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.429
This is not a trick question.

33:34.471 --> 33:36.932
I just wanted

33:34.471 --> 33:36.932
an opinion from..

33:36.974 --> 33:39.518
Oh, for heaven's sake.

33:36.974 --> 33:39.518
Go back to your work.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.978
[doorbell dings]

33:41.019 --> 33:42.771
I guess I'll get that.

33:46.650 --> 33:47.776
Rory.

33:47.818 --> 33:48.902
Can I come in?

33:48.944 --> 33:51.363
Oh. Well, alright.

33:48.944 --> 33:51.363
Come in.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.200
Didn't expect to see you

33:52.990 --> 33:55.200
until dinner tonight.

33:55.241 --> 33:57.202
I needed to talk

33:55.241 --> 33:57.202
to you.

33:57.243 --> 34:00.038
Yes, well, your grandmother

33:57.243 --> 34:00.038
is running some errands

34:00.079 --> 34:01.957
and I was doing some work

34:00.079 --> 34:01.957
in the house, so..

34:01.999 --> 34:05.878
Well, I assume you've heard

34:01.999 --> 34:05.878
about everything by now.

34:05.919 --> 34:10.841
Yes, well, I believe

34:05.919 --> 34:10.841
I've heard some bits and pieces.

34:10.883 --> 34:14.260
You know, I really was

34:10.883 --> 34:14.260
in the middle of something.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.346
Can this possibly wait

34:14.302 --> 34:16.346
until tonight?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.891
I'll give you

34:16.388 --> 34:18.891
my full attention, I promise.

34:18.932 --> 34:20.308
[sobbing]

34:22.728 --> 34:24.312
Everything's falling apart.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.567
I messed everything up.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.567
I don't know what to do.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.029
Your grandmother

34:30.109 --> 34:32.029
should be back any minute.

34:34.865 --> 34:36.783
I can have the maid

34:34.865 --> 34:36.783
make us some tea.

34:36.825 --> 34:40.161
I'm so sorry, grandpa.

34:36.825 --> 34:40.161
I'm so sorry about everything.

34:40.203 --> 34:43.040
I just don't know

34:40.203 --> 34:43.040
what to do. I don't.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.377
It's alright.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.757
Everything

34:48.879 --> 34:51.757
will be alright.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.384
Where is she, dude?

34:54.426 --> 34:56.053
Don't know, man.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.053
I'm not her warden.

This is the second emergency

34:57.721 --> 34:59.097
Time is pressing.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.474
I have a 10-pound salami

34:59.138 --> 35:01.474
sitting out in the van.

35:02.392 --> 35:03.602
Do not giggle.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.812
This is not dirty.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.812
This is a job.

35:05.854 --> 35:06.855
Hey, can one of you quiz me

35:06.897 --> 35:07.898
on the open house procedures?

35:07.940 --> 35:09.024
Level 12, dude.

35:09.066 --> 35:11.401
I'll do it.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.201
True.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.412
I'd add a little potpourri

35:20.243 --> 35:22.412
to the Johns, too.

Jeez!

- All boys here?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.916
- Yes.

35:25.958 --> 35:26.959
Good.

Guys.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.461

35:29.502 --> 35:31.546
Your mother just took

35:29.502 --> 35:31.546
10 years off my life?

35:31.588 --> 35:34.007
- We are going on tour!

35:31.588 --> 35:34.007
- We are?

35:34.049 --> 35:35.550
What are you

35:34.049 --> 35:35.550
talking about?

35:35.592 --> 35:37.469
All of you,

35:35.592 --> 35:37.469
gather around, please.

35:39.387 --> 35:42.307
Do not stand there

35:39.387 --> 35:42.307
looking stupid, move!

35:42.348 --> 35:44.101
Okay, you start

35:42.348 --> 35:44.101
at the first lady

35:44.142 --> 35:45.644
of our sacred heart

35:44.142 --> 35:45.644
on the 4th

35:45.685 --> 35:47.604

35:45.685 --> 35:47.604
on the 6th

35:47.646 --> 35:48.730
Chapel hill on the 10th

35:48.772 --> 35:49.773
the big auditorium

35:49.815 --> 35:51.108
not the Sunday school room.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.651
Are you sensing

35:51.149 --> 35:52.651
a pattern here?

35:52.692 --> 35:54.611
We move in kind

35:52.692 --> 35:54.611
of a horseshoe shape.

35:54.653 --> 35:55.737
It looks well thought out.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.155
No, they're all churches!

35:57.196 --> 35:59.032
Not churches.

35:57.196 --> 35:59.032
Theaters in churches.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.200
I have contacts

35:59.074 --> 36:01.200
with the entire east coast

36:06.539 --> 36:07.749
What?

36:07.791 --> 36:09.709
I have you booked solid

36:07.791 --> 36:09.709
for two months.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.169
Families in each town

36:11.210 --> 36:13.338
will take you in,

36:11.210 --> 36:13.338
feed you, put you up..

36:13.379 --> 36:15.799
I don't know.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.799
This seems a little weird.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.216
Weird? What weird?

36:17.258 --> 36:18.677
You need to play.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.677
Here's places to play.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.428
Nice places.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.428
Clean places.

36:20.470 --> 36:21.847
Don't wear

36:20.470 --> 36:21.847
that outfit onstage.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.140
This is my delivery outfit!

36:23.181 --> 36:24.975
Lane, tell her

36:23.181 --> 36:24.975
I don't dress like this!

36:25.017 --> 36:26.518
- I need to see your songs.

36:25.017 --> 36:26.518
- Why?

36:26.559 --> 36:28.478
To see if you need

36:26.559 --> 36:28.478
to make adjustments.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.896
Lyrics must be clean.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.648
Okay, that's where

36:29.938 --> 36:31.648
we draw the line.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.232
We will not change

36:31.690 --> 36:33.232
our lyrics.

Oh, please. Prince made

36:33.274 --> 36:37.029
$57 million take home last year.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.322
He didn't swear,

36:37.070 --> 36:39.322
and he mentioned God.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.406
Catch up!

36:40.448 --> 36:41.574
Okay, last problem.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.076
Transportation.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.744
- Hey, what about the van?

36:43.118 --> 36:44.744
- What van?

36:44.786 --> 36:46.204
Gil's delivery van.

36:46.245 --> 36:48.289
- You have van?

36:46.245 --> 36:48.289
- Yeah, right outside.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.499
Full of salami.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.959
Let's see this van!

36:56.422 --> 36:58.466
Lane, we can't go on some

36:58.508 --> 37:00.052
crazy Christian-crusade tour!

37:00.093 --> 37:01.136
It's a tour, Zach.

37:01.178 --> 37:02.512
It's a chance to play

37:02.554 --> 37:03.805
to keep our band together.

37:03.847 --> 37:04.848
Isn't that important?

37:04.890 --> 37:05.891
Who cares where we're playing?

37:05.932 --> 37:07.100
Our music will be out there.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.267
I think a tour would be

37:07.142 --> 37:08.267
kinda neat.

37:08.309 --> 37:10.228
Brian, if you do a tour right

37:10.269 --> 37:11.855
it could be way more

37:10.269 --> 37:11.855
than neat.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.356
- 'Gil, get over here.'

37:11.897 --> 37:13.356
- Yes, ma'am.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.900
- 'This is your van?'

37:13.398 --> 37:14.900
- Yes.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.151
But it's not really

37:14.941 --> 37:16.151
big enough for a tour van.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.527
What are you talking about?

37:17.569 --> 37:19.278
All 27 girls

37:17.569 --> 37:19.278
and their tambourines

37:19.320 --> 37:21.280
would have fit

37:19.320 --> 37:21.280
very nicely in here.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.741
- Legs crossed, of course.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.741
- But..

37:22.782 --> 37:25.118
Drums go there, bass goes there,

37:22.782 --> 37:25.118
guitars go there

37:25.160 --> 37:27.328
'Lane rides up front,

37:25.160 --> 37:27.328
and we get rid'

37:27.370 --> 37:28.997
of that big salami.

37:29.039 --> 37:31.083
Pop the hood.

37:29.039 --> 37:31.083
I need to check the engine.

37:31.124 --> 37:33.376
Okay, okay,

37:31.124 --> 37:33.376
I know it's not perfect

37:33.418 --> 37:34.920
it's not the festival express

37:34.961 --> 37:37.881
but it could be

37:34.961 --> 37:37.881
really great.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.383
- What do you say?

37:37.923 --> 37:40.383
- I think it's freaking crazy.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.802
Which also happens to be

37:40.425 --> 37:42.802
completely rock 'n' roll.

37:42.844 --> 37:43.970
- Let's do it!

37:42.844 --> 37:43.970
- Seriously?

37:44.012 --> 37:45.304
Totally!

37:45.346 --> 37:46.681
Century 21 has been around

37:45.346 --> 37:46.681
for over 30 years.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.141
I'm sure it'll be here

37:46.723 --> 37:48.141
when I get back.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.226
Zach..

37:49.267 --> 37:50.476
Well, jeez, Dorothy

37:50.518 --> 37:52.270
if Tin Man

37:50.518 --> 37:52.270
and Lion are gonna go

37:52.311 --> 37:53.939
I guess

37:52.311 --> 37:53.939
I have to go, too.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.774
- Yes!

37:53.980 --> 37:55.774
- Yeah!

37:55.815 --> 37:57.192
(Mrs. Kim)

37:55.815 --> 37:57.192
'Gil, get over here

37:55.815 --> 37:57.192
and pop the hood now!'

37:57.234 --> 37:58.610
- Yes, ma'am.

37:57.234 --> 37:58.610
- 'I haven't got all day.'

37:58.651 --> 38:00.070
- 'I'm sorry.'

37:58.651 --> 38:00.070
- 'You'll need new hoses.'

38:00.112 --> 38:01.446
'Spark plugs, oil change.'

38:01.487 --> 38:03.489
(Gil)

38:01.487 --> 38:03.489
'Wait, wait,

38:01.487 --> 38:03.489
let me write this down.'

38:05.324 --> 38:07.119
Hi.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.287
- Can I take your coat?

38:07.160 --> 38:09.287
- Yes, thank you.

(Emily)

38:09.328 --> 38:10.830
'Lorelai, we're in here.'

38:10.872 --> 38:13.583
Oh, hey, I thought I'd come

38:10.872 --> 38:13.583
a little early

38:13.625 --> 38:15.252
so we could strategize.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.838
Sit down, Lorelai.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.548
Okay.

38:22.008 --> 38:24.636
Uh, Rory should be here

38:22.008 --> 38:24.636
pretty soon, so..

38:24.677 --> 38:27.346
Your mother and I have been

38:24.677 --> 38:27.346
talking about your situation.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.182
We have discussed

38:27.388 --> 38:29.182
the matter thoroughly

38:29.224 --> 38:31.434
and we have come

38:29.224 --> 38:31.434
to a decision.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.563
Rory will be taking

38:32.852 --> 38:35.563
some time off from Yale.

38:35.605 --> 38:38.399
'She will be moving into

38:35.605 --> 38:38.399
the pool house here with us.'

38:38.441 --> 38:40.777
'We will find her

38:38.441 --> 38:40.777
some sort of suitable job'

38:40.819 --> 38:42.654
'through one of our friends'

38:42.695 --> 38:44.906
'and then, after

38:42.695 --> 38:44.906
a suitable time has passed'

38:44.948 --> 38:47.867
'we will revisit the subject

38:44.948 --> 38:47.867
of her returning to school.'

38:49.161 --> 38:51.079
(Emily)

38:49.161 --> 38:51.079
Where are you going?

38:54.749 --> 38:56.375
I was sitting

38:54.749 --> 38:56.375
right here.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.585
I came in, and I sat right here

38:57.627 --> 38:59.296
and we-we had

38:57.627 --> 38:59.296
the conversation, right?

38:59.337 --> 39:00.338
I mean, I'm not imagining it,

38:59.337 --> 39:00.338
right?

39:00.379 --> 39:01.589
- Lorelai..

39:00.379 --> 39:01.589
- I had coffee.

39:01.631 --> 39:02.632
- You had grapefruit.

39:01.631 --> 39:02.632
- Lorelai.

39:02.674 --> 39:03.925
Dad was reading the paper

39:03.967 --> 39:05.468
he had to go, so I said

39:03.967 --> 39:05.468
I'd make it quick.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.095
And-and we sat here

39:05.510 --> 39:07.095
and we talked

39:07.137 --> 39:08.596
about how we were going

39:07.137 --> 39:08.596
to stick together

39:08.638 --> 39:10.556
and convince Rory

39:08.638 --> 39:10.556
to go back to school.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.851
That did happen, right? I mean

39:10.598 --> 39:12.851
I'm not completely wacko.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.227
Yes, it happened.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.770
I mean, obviously

39:14.269 --> 39:15.770
I'm a little wacko

39:15.812 --> 39:17.063
'cause I came here for help

39:15.812 --> 39:17.063
in the first place

39:17.105 --> 39:18.523
but I'm not totally delusional.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.066
There were other things

39:18.564 --> 39:20.066
to consider.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.567
You said you would

39:20.108 --> 39:21.567
back me on this.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.528
You said you weren't

39:21.609 --> 39:23.528
gonna let this happen.

39:23.569 --> 39:26.572
Rory's young, and I'm sure once

39:23.569 --> 39:26.572
she's had some time and space

39:26.614 --> 39:28.449
she will change her mind,

39:26.614 --> 39:28.449
but for now

39:28.491 --> 39:31.410
this is what she wants to do,

39:28.491 --> 39:31.410
and we need to respect that.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.579
Have you talked to Rory

39:31.452 --> 39:33.579
about this? Your great plan?

39:33.621 --> 39:35.040
- Does she even know about it?

39:33.621 --> 39:35.040
- Yes.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.333
She's fine

39:35.081 --> 39:36.333
with the arrangement.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.168
So you went to her

39:36.374 --> 39:38.168
behind my back.

39:38.210 --> 39:39.794
She came to<i> me,</i> Lorelai.

39:39.836 --> 39:42.047
She told me what

39:39.836 --> 39:42.047
she wanted, in her own words.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.965
Wow, so that does work

39:42.088 --> 39:43.965
occasionally with you, huh?

39:44.007 --> 39:45.383
This makes sense.

39:45.424 --> 39:47.177
We don't want her

39:45.424 --> 39:47.177
to move in with Logan. Do we?

39:47.219 --> 39:48.386
And since you don't want Rory

39:48.427 --> 39:49.846
to move back home

39:48.427 --> 39:49.846
to Stars Hollow

39:49.888 --> 39:51.764
it just makes sense

39:49.888 --> 39:51.764
that she move in here with us.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.516
- I-I don't understand..

39:51.806 --> 39:53.516
- 'We can watch her.'

39:53.558 --> 39:55.185
Keep her from getting

39:53.558 --> 39:55.185
into trouble.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.811
We can get her

39:55.227 --> 39:56.811
back on track.

39:56.853 --> 39:59.814
You-you'll understand that

39:56.853 --> 39:59.814
once you calm down

39:59.856 --> 40:02.067
and think

39:59.856 --> 40:02.067
about it rationally.

41:48.173 --> 41:49.882

First off, we call Yale,

42:18.870 --> 42:21.706
and we tell them something like

42:21.747 --> 42:24.417
uh, Rory had

42:21.747 --> 42:24.417
a chemical imbalance

42:24.459 --> 42:25.918
and she was medically

42:24.459 --> 42:25.918
out of her mind

42:25.960 --> 42:28.004
when she told them

42:25.960 --> 42:28.004
she was dropping out.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.547
And then we get her out

of your parents'

42:29.588 --> 42:30.840

'cause you can talk her
