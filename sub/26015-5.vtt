06:26.928 --> 06:28.096
We don't have skin tones.

[bleep] drawing.

our [bleep] problem,

06:55.581 --> 06:56.374

07:00.253 --> 07:01.587
- Let's go out of the box.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.423
- I think it would be cool to
do, like, a body,

07:04.507 --> 07:06.551
have the head be
a light bulb.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.011
And then instead of an arm,
do a little extension cord

07:09.095 --> 07:10.179
with the socket
in the heart.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.348

07:14.433 --> 07:16.060

{\an3}- Chris, I hope you are in this,
win or lose.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.439

want to have to explain it.

the whole [bleep] time.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.360
Let's [bleep] do it.
Who's drawing it?

07:24.443 --> 07:25.695

<i>about Angel and Amanda</i>

07:37.039 --> 07:37.957
{\an1}If you hate it that much,
go sit the [bleep] out.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.001

07:40.084 --> 07:40.877

{\an1}that you're not

07:43.045 --> 07:44.338
I'm a grown man, [bleep],
I'm not gonna do this.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.631
{\an1}- What do
you want me to do?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.884
- Step back, then, and
leave everybody alone

07:47.967 --> 07:49.427
rather than bringing
negative energy.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.096
- All right, Christian,
what is it that I can help with?

07:52.180 --> 07:52.972
- Can you help me put
the grey on here?

07:53.055 --> 07:55.349
- Yes, I can.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.559
