WEBVTT

00:11.640 --> 00:14.640
Ah. Ha ha! Extra point.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.110
Put some over there.
Store some over there.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.520
- Hey hey hey, you know what?
- What?

00:19.550 --> 00:22.320
Flag on the play. Flag on the play.
Excessive celebration.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.950
There's no penalties in paper football.

00:24.990 --> 00:27.190
There should be
'cause that was really annoying.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.730
Wait, hold on. Which point was annoying?
This right here?

00:29.760 --> 00:31.960
You didn't like that?
What if I slow it down for you?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.630
- You like that?
- No.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.500
- You don't like that?
- No, still annoying.

00:35.530 --> 00:36.570
Speed it up.
Speed it up!

00:36.600 --> 00:38.200
What are you guys doing?

00:38.240 --> 00:41.070
- We're playing paper football.
- Oh, paper football.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.540
Excellent topic.
Okay.

00:43.570 --> 00:45.540
Paper football is an american tradition.

00:45.580 --> 00:48.040
Allowing boys to entertain
themselves with nothing more.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.550
Than a piece of paper and a flat surface.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.350
What?

00:52.380 --> 00:54.580
On the other hand,

00:54.580 --> 00:57.820
Paper football requires no
athletic ability and no thinking,

00:57.850 --> 01:00.660
Therefore making it
a complete waste of time...

01:01.930 --> 01:03.890
And paper.

01:03.930 --> 01:07.030
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I'm on the debate team.

01:07.060 --> 01:10.800
I have to prepared to argue
any topic, no matter how stupid.

01:10.830 --> 01:14.270

P.J., what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at the dentist.

02:16.150 --> 02:18.850
Totally forgot.
Why didn't you remind me?

02:18.880 --> 02:20.420
I did remind you.

02:20.450 --> 02:23.420
I put a note on your pillow,
I texted you and...

02:26.720 --> 02:29.090
Mom, you did everything you could.

02:29.130 --> 02:30.730
No one's blaming you here.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.530
P.J., honey, you are
17 years old.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.430
When are you gonna stop
being afraid of the dentist?

02:36.470 --> 02:39.100
When he stops coming at me
with those pointy tools.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.010
Besides, my tooth is feeling a lot better.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.240
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.410
Okay, hang on one sec.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.650
Yeah, bite it.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.580
Sure.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.420
Mmm!

02:56.450 --> 02:58.620
Mmm, delicious.

02:58.660 --> 03:00.860
Now...

03:00.890 --> 03:02.620
If you'll excuse me.

03:04.260 --> 03:07.400
<i>Ow!</i>

03:10.400 --> 03:13.770
You want me to wear a grass skirt.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.870
In front of the whole class?

03:19.010 --> 03:21.810
Jo, you need to put on the entire costume.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.750
Gabe, let me explain something to you:

03:25.780 --> 03:28.250
You're an idiot.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.250
You're an idiot, idiot!

03:31.290 --> 03:32.650
- Idiot!
- Idiot!

03:32.690 --> 03:34.290
- Idiot!
- Whoa!

03:34.360 --> 03:36.490
Ho! What is going on
in here?

03:36.530 --> 03:39.930
Jo and I have to do this stupid project
together on one of the states.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.460
We got hawaii.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.130
The most boring of all the states.

03:44.170 --> 03:45.900
I know.

03:45.940 --> 03:47.800
Why couldn't we have gotten
one of the cool states.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.240
Like nebraska?

03:50.270 --> 03:53.110
I had a great idea for that one.

03:53.140 --> 03:56.010
Let me guess:
Dress up like a corn-stalk?

03:58.680 --> 04:00.520
No.

04:00.550 --> 04:04.820
All right, look, it may not
be as glamorous as nebraska,

04:04.850 --> 04:07.090
But you know what?
Hawaii's a pretty cool state.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.360
Name one cool thing about it.

04:09.390 --> 04:12.030
Well, it's the only state
made up entirely of islands.

04:14.330 --> 04:15.930
Okay.

04:15.970 --> 04:19.370
It has lots of unique flora and fauna.

04:19.399 --> 04:23.940
Dad, we can't just fill up our
report with a bunch of facts.

04:23.970 --> 04:26.710
All right, you know what?

04:26.740 --> 04:28.440
Hawaii's got an active volcano.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.850
Hey, we could build a volcano.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.050
I like things that explode.

04:34.850 --> 04:37.850
I don't know.
Sounds like a lot of work.

04:37.890 --> 04:40.360
Okay, well, I do have another idea.

04:43.860 --> 04:45.890
Volcano it is.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.400
P.J., you know what
I was just thinking about?

04:55.440 --> 04:59.170
Remember when we used to have
a mommy-and-p.J. Day?

05:00.940 --> 05:02.810
We should do that again.

05:02.850 --> 05:04.480
We haven't done that since I was seven.

05:04.510 --> 05:06.180
How about tomorrow?
We'll do whatever you want.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.020
You know what'd be fun?

05:08.050 --> 05:10.820
Not having
a p.J.-And-mommy day.

05:10.850 --> 05:14.820
That makes mommy sad.

05:14.860 --> 05:16.930
Mom, I'll hang out with you if you want.

05:16.960 --> 05:18.590
We can have
a mommy-and-teddy day.

05:18.630 --> 05:21.660
Yeah, mommy doesn't want that.

05:21.700 --> 05:25.100
Okay, ah!
Tomorrow after school,

05:25.130 --> 05:28.100
We are having
a p.J.-And-mommy day.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.110
And you are gonna love it.

05:30.140 --> 05:34.140
Mom, you can make me go,
but you can't make me love it.

05:35.580 --> 05:37.110
Okay, I'll love it.

05:39.750 --> 05:42.220
I thought mommy-and-teddy day
would be fun,

05:42.250 --> 05:43.690
But apparently not.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.960
Honey, it's actually
p.J.-And-dentist day.

05:46.990 --> 05:49.190
Oh, sneaky.

05:49.230 --> 05:52.030
The only way for me to get him
there is for me to trick him.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.060
So what's this "take gabe to laser tag"?

05:54.100 --> 05:55.130
Haircut.

06:02.310 --> 06:03.710
What's this?

06:03.740 --> 06:05.640
I was cleaning out my desk drawer,

06:05.680 --> 06:07.440
Came across this gift
certificate to a day spa.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.710
I think I forgot to give it to
you, like, on valentine's day.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.280
<i>Or something.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

06:11.310 --> 06:13.820
Dad, was there anything
for me in the magic drawer?

06:13.850 --> 06:15.880
Uh, yes...

06:15.920 --> 06:19.720
A flyer to your fourth-grade
production of "the sound of music."

06:19.760 --> 06:22.420
I look forward to attending.

06:24.860 --> 06:27.500
Bob honey, this gift
certificate expires tomorrow.

06:27.530 --> 06:30.070
- Well, let's go tomorrow.
- I can't.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.970
I have to take p.J.
To the dentist.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.840
Mom, go.
I'll get p.J. To the dentist.

06:34.870 --> 06:35.970
How you gonna do that?

06:36.010 --> 06:37.940
I'll figure something out.

06:37.970 --> 06:40.510
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I'm smarter than him.

06:40.540 --> 06:43.180
What about charlie and gabe?

06:43.210 --> 06:46.210
Yeah, they're smarter than him too.

06:53.090 --> 06:55.360
Volcano's looking great, dad.

06:57.130 --> 07:00.260
Do you think it's big enough?

07:00.300 --> 07:02.900
Good point.
Little bigger, dad.

07:02.930 --> 07:05.600
This is just the frame.
It's gonna be a whole lot bigger.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.470
After it's been
papier-mached.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.840
You don't have to tell us.
Just do it.

07:09.870 --> 07:13.010
Gabe, this is my house.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.610
I don't take orders from you
or anybody else.

07:15.650 --> 07:17.280
Bob, time to go to the spa.

07:17.310 --> 07:18.510
Coming, honey.

07:18.550 --> 07:21.450
Okay, kids, let's listen up.

07:21.480 --> 07:25.920
Now the volcano is going to erupt
when you press this button.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.990
If you wanted it to erupt again,

07:28.020 --> 07:29.860
You'd have to take the whole thing apart.

07:29.890 --> 07:32.330
Therefore... and I cannot
stress this strongly enough...

07:32.360 --> 07:34.860
Do not press the button.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.670
What'd he just say?

07:40.700 --> 07:44.440
Something about a button.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.480
This is bob.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.510
Yeah.
No, I got it.

07:52.550 --> 07:55.450
I got it. Okay. Yeah, we'll see
you there in about 20 minutes.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.850
Sorry, honey, it's an extermination call.

07:57.890 --> 08:00.120
We gotta make one little
stop before we get to the spa.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.320
Really?

08:01.360 --> 08:03.330
Honey, it's a 313... code yellow.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.360
- What's that?
- Possum.

08:05.390 --> 08:09.600
Wouldn't it be faster to just say "possum"?

08:09.630 --> 08:13.440
Well, sure, you want to
take all the magic out of it.

08:17.770 --> 08:21.240
- What's this stuff called again?
- Newspaper.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.410
It's how people in
the olden days got their news.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.250
Uh, gabe, jo, listen up.

08:29.290 --> 08:32.890
So p.J. And I have to leave, but
I'll be back in like 15 minutes.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.890
That means you're gonna
be alone with charlie.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.230
Now she's taking a nap upstairs.
She probably won't bother you.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.460
But if you have any problems with charlie,
just give me a call on my cell.

08:42.730 --> 08:46.100
What'd she say?

08:46.140 --> 08:48.470
Something about charlie.

08:55.780 --> 08:58.250
Ow, p.J.!

09:00.150 --> 09:04.250
Oh! Ow, p.J.!

09:04.290 --> 09:06.290
What? What's wrong?

09:06.320 --> 09:08.020
I think I broke my tooth.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.390
Let me see.
Ew!

09:10.430 --> 09:13.730
It's a bloody mess in there.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.360
And there's seeds.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.730
Yeah, well, can you take me to the dentist?

09:18.770 --> 09:20.870
Ha, so awesome.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.900
What?
That I broke my tooth?

09:22.940 --> 09:25.110
No, that I got out of
mommy-and-p.J. Day.

09:31.110 --> 09:33.110
This is so cool.

09:33.150 --> 09:36.550
I've never seen you in action
doing your bug-catching "thang."

09:36.590 --> 09:39.420
Okay, look, the "thang" that we're catching.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.460
Is not a bug, it's a possum.

09:41.490 --> 09:42.720
Mm-hmm.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.560
Which rhymes with awesome.
Bam!

09:44.590 --> 09:45.960
Ow!

09:46.000 --> 09:47.960
<i>Will you</i>
<i>cut that out?</i>

09:48.000 --> 09:49.930
I'm on duty.
Thank you.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.670
Okay. All right,
here we go.

09:58.610 --> 10:00.780
I think we've got a problem.

10:00.810 --> 10:03.750
Oh well, guess I'll have to see you
do your "thang" some other time.

10:03.780 --> 10:05.450
Come on.
Let's go get massages.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.520
Um, or...

10:08.550 --> 10:12.790
Pop! Nah nah nah nah nah!

10:12.820 --> 10:13.920
Oh no.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.260
Please?
I would do this for you.

10:16.290 --> 10:21.000
Well, this is officially
our second-worst date ever.

10:21.030 --> 10:23.000
What was the worst?

10:23.030 --> 10:25.530
Hot tubbing with your grandparents.

10:25.570 --> 10:29.900
No, you're right.
That was a bad idea.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.180
- Ow ow.
- Oh, excuse me, excuse me.

10:36.210 --> 10:39.180
Uh, my sister needs to see the dentist.
Her mouth is all bloody.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.980
It's really bad.
There's seeds.

10:43.150 --> 10:44.820
Last name?

10:44.850 --> 10:46.220
Duncan.

10:46.260 --> 10:49.460
Oh okay.
Yeah, we have you right here.

10:49.490 --> 10:51.830
P.J. Duncan, 3:00.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.360
What? But that-that
can't be right.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.100
No, that is right.

10:57.130 --> 10:58.930
Hello, p.J.

10:58.970 --> 11:00.600
Emmett?

11:00.640 --> 11:01.970
What are you doing here?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.540
I asked him to come.

11:03.570 --> 11:05.340
Why aren't you holding your mouth anymore?

11:05.370 --> 11:08.140
Because I'm not seeing the dentist today.

11:08.180 --> 11:09.810
You are.

11:09.850 --> 11:14.320
P.J., it's time.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.150
No!

11:18.190 --> 11:20.660
Ow!

11:22.000 --> 11:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:29.850 --> 11:31.650
- I can't do this.
- No!

11:31.680 --> 11:34.390
Yes, you can. Okay?
You have a problem,

11:34.420 --> 11:36.150
But we're gonna help you through it.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.990
We all want what's best for you, man.

11:38.020 --> 11:41.890
Look, what if I promise to start flossing?

11:41.930 --> 11:45.130
Okay, we've heard those promises before.

11:46.630 --> 11:48.500
Come on, man, be strong.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.230
You're right.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.270
It's just a little tooth.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.570
It's just a little tooth.

11:54.610 --> 11:55.940
Thattaboy.

11:55.970 --> 11:58.110
- No no no!
- Get him, get him!

12:00.780 --> 12:03.050
P.J., let go!
Let go, let go.

12:04.380 --> 12:07.390
- Our first hug.
- Oh, not now!

12:13.890 --> 12:16.190
Don't make me brush you!

12:22.300 --> 12:24.970
Oh no.
Where are my...

12:26.440 --> 12:28.910
...Glasses?

12:28.940 --> 12:32.940
Oh! Now my tooth
is really broken.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.080
Oh!

12:34.110 --> 12:36.950
P.J., let's go.

12:36.980 --> 12:39.450
I said,
"let's get a fish tank."

12:39.480 --> 12:43.350
He said, "no, the big
toothbrush will be fun."

12:48.460 --> 12:52.300
Charlie, go to sleep, please.
Just stop.

12:52.330 --> 12:56.070
Gabe, unless that kid
can paint, get her out of here.

13:01.570 --> 13:04.310
Teddy, when are you getting home?

13:04.340 --> 13:07.040
I don't care about your stupid tooth.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.180
You can't leave me alone with charlie.

13:09.210 --> 13:12.720
Wait, teddy!
Oh.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.350
You're not alone, gabe.

13:14.390 --> 13:17.420
I'm not gonna help you,
but you're not alone.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.890
What's that smell?

13:21.930 --> 13:24.360
It's coming from
the business end of that kid.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.730
You gotta change it.

13:26.770 --> 13:29.800
I don't know how to change a diaper.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.200
It's just like taking apart a burrito.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.840
And then putting it back together.

13:34.870 --> 13:38.680
I think I've eaten my last burrito.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.250
You look adorable.

13:50.290 --> 13:51.560
Shut up.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.830
Okay, honey, look,
the possum's in the trap.

13:55.860 --> 13:57.760
All you gotta do... you just
gotta tie the rope to it.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.230
- And I'll pull it right out.
- Oh.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.040
- I love you.
- Whatever.

14:07.470 --> 14:09.340
Oh my gosh.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.670
What do you see, honey?

14:10.710 --> 14:13.880
Dirt, cobwebs, bugs.

14:13.910 --> 14:16.010
I don't know how you do this all day, bob.

14:16.050 --> 14:18.050
That's 'cause I know I'm
coming home to you, sweetie.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.780
Oh, shut up.

14:19.820 --> 14:23.950
Okay, I see the trap.

14:23.990 --> 14:26.890
<i>Bob, I'm not so sure</i>
<i>this is a possum.</i>

14:26.930 --> 14:30.630
- What do you mean? - Well, are
possums black with a white stripe?

14:30.660 --> 14:33.930
What? No, get out.
That's not a possum. That's a...

14:33.970 --> 14:36.330
Skunk.

14:40.510 --> 14:44.140
<i>Ah, charlie,</i>
<i>stay still.</i>

14:44.180 --> 14:47.410
Stupid diapers.

14:48.780 --> 14:51.250
Can you please keep it down back there?

14:51.280 --> 14:52.920
I'm trying to work here.

14:52.950 --> 14:55.320
Okay.

14:55.350 --> 14:58.590
You know, this would be
a lot easier if you helped me.

14:58.620 --> 15:02.160
Yes, it probably would,
put we had an agreement.

15:02.190 --> 15:05.330
I'll handle my thing that
explodes and you'll handle yours.

15:07.630 --> 15:10.670
Well, we've got a problem.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.600
I'm all out of clean diapers.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.410
Now what am I gonna do?

15:15.440 --> 15:18.940
Okay, charlie, all better now.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.780
Is that a shirt...
And duct tape?

15:26.820 --> 15:28.950
Yes.

15:28.990 --> 15:30.590
Oh.

15:30.620 --> 15:34.020
See, I call it
"the shirt diaper."

15:34.060 --> 15:36.960
The good thing is that she's protected.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.400
And it's not my shirt.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.540
Oh, now what?

15:46.570 --> 15:49.010
Why can't she just sit still?

15:49.040 --> 15:53.040
I bet some more duct tape
would make her sit still.

15:57.980 --> 16:00.650
Hey, I'm gonna need to practice
for my debate later.

16:00.690 --> 16:02.690
- Could you give me a topic?
- Okay.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.520
How about, why won't you go out with me?

16:04.560 --> 16:08.360
No, I need a topic I can argue
from both sides.

16:09.690 --> 16:13.160
Okay, here we go.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.630
Is this real life?

16:16.670 --> 16:19.800
The doctor gave him some anesthesia.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.210
Teddy, come on back.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.040
Teddy?

16:24.080 --> 16:27.850
I have a sister named teddy.

16:33.620 --> 16:36.850
Okay, so you didn't like carrots.

16:39.190 --> 16:42.290
How about some yummy peaches?

16:43.560 --> 16:46.100
There you go.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.030
Oh!

16:49.070 --> 16:51.540
That's it.
You're in trouble now.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.600
Jo, get in here!

16:56.040 --> 16:57.780
What do you want now?

16:57.810 --> 16:59.040
She won't eat.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.250
- Not my problem.
- Hey!

17:02.280 --> 17:04.550
Don't walk away when I'm talking to you.

17:04.579 --> 17:06.450
I have work to do.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.720
I don't care.

17:07.750 --> 17:10.290
I'm having a really bad day.

17:10.319 --> 17:14.630
And all I'm asking for is a little respect.

17:14.690 --> 17:18.700
Oh, so what I do isn't important?

17:18.730 --> 17:20.430
Stop putting words into my mouth.

17:20.470 --> 17:21.970
You know what?
That's it.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.130
I'm outta here.

17:24.170 --> 17:25.940
You can't leave.

17:25.970 --> 17:27.640
Oh yeah? Watch me.

17:27.670 --> 17:29.970
Jo, wait, don't go.

17:30.010 --> 17:32.580
It's the first time I've been
left alone with charlie.

17:32.610 --> 17:34.040
I'm blowing it.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.580
I can't do this by myself.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.720
All right, I'll help you with the baby.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.660
But just so you know, every doll I've
ever had ended up without its head.

17:55.370 --> 17:59.100
Would you look at that?
You're really good with babies.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.340
Yeah, I guess I am.

18:01.370 --> 18:04.540
If you ever tell anyone, I'll hurt you.

18:06.340 --> 18:07.610
<i>We're back.</i>

18:07.650 --> 18:10.380
Oh, here we go, charlie.
Here you go.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.790
Am I in hawaii...

18:16.490 --> 18:19.260
With grandma?

18:19.290 --> 18:21.630
I told you, these are my grandma's glasses.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.930
Just because I'm wearing them
doesn't make me grandma.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.760
You're cranky, old lady.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.670
Hey, emmett, where's teddy?

18:29.700 --> 18:31.600
Dropped her off at her debate.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.110
Okay, buddy, how about we have a seat?

18:35.140 --> 18:39.380
This thing followed me all the way home.

18:40.510 --> 18:44.150
- Hey kids.
- Hey dad.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.120
Why is charlie wearing a shirt diaper?

18:46.150 --> 18:49.720
Uh, long story.
Where's mom?

18:49.750 --> 18:52.490
Longer story.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.990
Hi, everybody.

18:55.030 --> 18:58.000
Mommy got stung.

18:58.030 --> 19:00.560
It was all daddy's fault.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.640
Uh, honey, can you get
that thing behind you?

19:04.670 --> 19:06.240
Right back there.

19:11.710 --> 19:14.080
- Love you.
- Shut up.

19:14.110 --> 19:17.820
Honey, just scrub yourself real good with
that tomato juice for about two hours.

19:17.850 --> 19:21.820
It'll get the smell
right out... I hope.

19:21.850 --> 19:25.990
Kids, don't ever go to the spa with daddy.

19:26.020 --> 19:28.860
Hey hey hey.

19:28.890 --> 19:31.230
Hey, baby girl.
I tell you what:

19:31.260 --> 19:33.230
Let's get you a real diaper, okay?

19:33.260 --> 19:36.000
Oh, that's my ride.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.770
I'm starving.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.070
Are you hungry?

19:42.270 --> 19:45.240
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

19:45.280 --> 19:48.680
- But I had fun.
- Me too.

19:48.710 --> 19:51.050
And we finished a pretty
awesome project too.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.380
I know. Can't wait to
see that volcano erupt.

19:53.420 --> 19:55.290
- I know.
- Okay.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.090
No! No!
Wait, don't don't don't!

20:09.770 --> 20:13.140
Volcano made a boom boom.

20:18.980 --> 20:20.780
And that is why.

20:20.810 --> 20:23.250
For the safety of our students.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.950
And the peace of mind of our parents,

20:25.980 --> 20:28.220
I would argue that cell phone use in school.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.090
Should not only be allowed,

20:30.120 --> 20:33.220
It should be encouraged.

20:33.260 --> 20:34.730
Thank you.

20:36.330 --> 20:38.930
<i>Miss duncan,</i>
<i>your rebuttal?</i>

20:38.960 --> 20:41.430
Ahem.

20:41.470 --> 20:43.900
Cellular phone usage.

20:43.940 --> 20:46.170
Is a serious problem.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.770
That presents many challenges
for the consumer.

20:49.810 --> 20:50.910
What?

20:50.940 --> 20:52.640
I said,

20:52.680 --> 20:57.250
Cellular phone usage is a serious issue...

20:57.280 --> 21:00.280
I concede.

21:07.530 --> 21:09.530
Hey, charlie, gabe here.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.630
And I'm doing the video diary tonight.

21:11.660 --> 21:14.530
Because teddy's having
some troubles with her words.

21:14.570 --> 21:17.300
Nothing serious.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.940
Yeah.

21:20.970 --> 21:24.840
Anyway, today was the first
day I took care of you.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.710
It went totally perfect.

21:26.740 --> 21:28.310
What?

21:28.350 --> 21:32.020
Okay, there were a few problems.

21:32.050 --> 21:36.850
But, I mean, you're fine.

21:36.890 --> 21:40.990
So they're probably going to
make me take care of you again.

21:41.030 --> 21:43.930
Yeah.
Good luck, charlie.

21:52.160 --> 21:56.190
I've got to say, gabe, I wasn't
sure about these things,

21:56.230 --> 21:57.460
But they are really comfortable.

21:57.530 --> 21:58.610
Yeah.

22:09.930 --> 22:13.340
I can't believe how much time I'm going to
save by not having to go to the bathroom.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.590
Dude, ha!

22:15.880 --> 22:19.720
I'm saving time right now, if you know what I mean.

22:21.860 --> 22:23.250
Nice.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.340
- Hey, dad, game's on.
- Yeah. Whoo!

22:37.160 --> 22:39.630
Looking good, dad.

22:39.730 --> 22:41.340
Oh, feelin' good, son.

22:41.340 --> 22:43.210
Whoo! Whoo.
