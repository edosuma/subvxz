WEBVTT

03:34.441 --> 03:35.608
Lunch.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.161
Hey. Hey, hey-

03:46.244 --> 03:48.246
Come here. Take a look at this.

03:50.707 --> 03:53.752
- What is it?
-It's a data stream from PS12.

03:54.169 --> 03:57.005
- Where is she?
- Right above sector 14.

03:57.964 --> 03:59.966
There isn't anything in sector 14.

04:00.091 --> 04:01.593
There is now.

04:31.752 --> 04:35.338
- Hello?
- <i>Miss Woods. Pleasure to speak to you.</i>

04:35.422 --> 04:38.008
<i>- Who is this?
- My name's Maxwell Stafford.</i>

04:38.091 --> 04:40.552
<i>I represent Weyland Industries.</i>

04:41.470 --> 04:45.056
- Let me guess. He's suing us again?
- You misunderstand.

04:45.140 --> 04:49.394
<i>Mr Weyland has offered to fund
your foundation for a year,</i>

04:49.478 --> 04:51.146
<i>if you'll meet With him.</i>

04:51.271 --> 04:52.564
When?

04:52.647 --> 04:54.065
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

04:54.441 --> 04:59.529
Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.
Take me a week to get back to the world.

05:00.113 --> 05:02.324
<i>Yes, I told Mr Weyland that.</i>

05:03.492 --> 05:05.827
He said he didn't have a week.

05:23.011 --> 05:25.305
We must be right on top of it.

05:46.660 --> 05:47.828
What is it, Sebastian?

06:03.012 --> 06:05.014
Early 1950s, I'd say.

06:06.056 --> 06:08.767
Hey, Juan, we are almost there.

06:08.851 --> 06:14.106
According to you, the Teotihuacans'
final gift to their dying king was a Pepsi.

06:14.190 --> 06:16.442
Give me one more month. Please.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.777
I'm bringing in another team.

06:19.320 --> 06:20.487
What?

06:21.697 --> 06:24.950
Without a crew and a new permit,
we're out of business.

06:25.034 --> 06:30.039
Hold the team together for two clays. I'll go
to Mexico City and I'll talk to the bank.

06:30.122 --> 06:32.041
I'll get us more money.

06:32.374 --> 06:35.836
I might be able to help you
accomplish that, Professor.

06:36.879 --> 06:38.380
Do I know you?

06:39.882 --> 06:43.010
In exchange for a little of your time.

07:07.580 --> 07:11.083
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should've switched the flash off.

07:11.167 --> 07:14.044
There's your magazine. Excuse me.

07:14.128 --> 07:15.546
That's OK.

07:16.130 --> 07:19.341
I'm documenting the trip for my boys.
This is them.

07:19.425 --> 07:21.594
Jacob and Scotty.

07:22.511 --> 07:24.722
Would you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.

07:24.805 --> 07:28.601
Just wanna show them
that their dad wasn't always so boring.

07:29.143 --> 07:30.603
- Smile.
- OK.

07:33.355 --> 07:35.441
- There you go.
- Thank you.

07:36.066 --> 07:39.028
I'm Graeme Miller.
I'm a chemical engineer.

07:39.111 --> 07:42.156
Alexa Woods,
environmental technician and guide.

07:42.239 --> 07:44.867
- Do you work for Weyland?
- Oh, no.

07:45.326 --> 07:49.663
No, I split my time between working
for a small environmental group

07:49.747 --> 07:53.083
and taking scientists
on expeditions on the ice.

07:53.167 --> 07:56.337
Lex. Buckle up.
We're gonna hit some turbulence.

07:56.420 --> 07:57.963
Thanks, Jack.

07:59.131 --> 08:01.800
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Of my dad's.

08:01.884 --> 08:03.969
He trained most of the pilots here.

08:04.053 --> 08:07.890
- Just passed the PSR.
- Oh, damn. I wish I'd got a picture.

08:08.182 --> 08:10.601
- Of what?
- The PSR.

08:10.976 --> 08:14.146
I wish he'd called it out
before we passed it.

08:14.939 --> 08:18.067
The PSR is the point of safe return.

08:18.150 --> 08:22.071
It means we've used up half our fuel,
so we can't turn back.

08:23.155 --> 08:28.494
Right, but if something went wrong,
we could land, presumably.

08:28.577 --> 08:30.913
- We could ditch.
- Yeah. Ditch.

08:30.996 --> 08:35.083
But the temperature of the water
would kill us in three minutes.

08:54.238 --> 08:57.324
- Weyland's cheque cleared.
- Good.

08:57.408 --> 09:00.577
You know what? We're gonna listen
to whatever he has to say,

09:00.661 --> 09:04.832
we nod, we smile, and we politely decline
whatever offer he makes.

09:05.082 --> 09:07.376
Take the money
and we head back to Mexico.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.002
- Right.
- Right.

09:20.431 --> 09:23.809
- Having fun?
- Yeah. This is quite an adventure.

09:23.892 --> 09:27.312
My kids won't believe this.
Would you mind taking a picture?

09:27.396 --> 09:31.483
- You have to hold that down till the flash...
- You're kidding.

09:31.567 --> 09:34.778
Get off,
or you'll be wearing your ass for a hat!

09:35.821 --> 09:37.531
All right, OK, sure.

09:37.614 --> 09:39.450
Nice team spirit.

09:40.534 --> 09:43.078
Keep the beakers away from the gear.

09:46.457 --> 09:48.375
What does he mean, "beaker"?

09:48.459 --> 09:50.961
That's what they call scientists out here.

09:51.044 --> 09:53.338
You know,
Beaker -like in The <i>Muppet Show.</i>

09:53.422 --> 09:56.967
Everybody, please, your attention.

10:02.598 --> 10:04.141
Mr Weyland.

10:17.154 --> 10:20.032
Seven days ago, one of my satellites

10:20.115 --> 10:21.951
over Antarctica
hunting for mineral deposits

10:22.034 --> 10:26.372
discovered a sudden heat bloom
beneath the earth, which outlined this.

10:27.456 --> 10:30.125
The red lines indicate solid walls.

10:30.709 --> 10:31.961
Through thermal mapping,

10:32.044 --> 10:35.965
we've generated a three-dimensional
image of the structure.

10:36.757 --> 10:42.179
It's massive, containing hundreds
of rooms, all built around a central core.

10:44.056 --> 10:46.475
My experts tell me it's a pyramid.

10:47.977 --> 10:51.230
What they can't agree on
is who built it and when.

10:51.855 --> 10:55.943
One expert tells me this has features
reminiscent of the Aztecs.

10:56.485 --> 10:58.821
Another tells me it's probably Cambodian.

10:58.904 --> 11:03.200
What they all agree on is that
the smooth side is definitively Egyptian.

11:03.283 --> 11:06.286
- I think your experts are right.
- Which one?

11:06.829 --> 11:09.581
- All of them.
- Meaning what, exactly?

11:11.375 --> 11:15.170
This pyramid contains
the features of all three cultures.

11:16.922 --> 11:19.883
This might be the first pyramid ever built.

11:19.967 --> 11:23.512
- But built by whom?
- By the first civilisation.

11:26.140 --> 11:27.474
Thank you.

11:28.308 --> 11:31.520
But how could anyone possibly
build a pyramid out here?

11:31.603 --> 11:34.398
Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.

11:34.481 --> 11:37.484
It's likely the continent
was once habitable.

11:37.943 --> 11:39.611
I can't tell you who built it.

11:39.695 --> 11:43.365
But if I could take a sample from it,
I can tell you how old it is.

11:43.449 --> 11:47.161
Dr Miller, I'm offering
to put you right next to this thing.

11:47.953 --> 11:50.622
- What caused the heat bloom?
- I don't know.

11:50.706 --> 11:54.626
- Where exactly on the ice is this?
- Bouvetmya Island.

11:54.710 --> 11:58.005
But it's not on the ice. It's 2,000ft below it.

12:01.467 --> 12:03.594
- Mr Quinn?
- Mr Stafford.

12:03.677 --> 12:06.388
You're looking at the best
drilling team in the world.

12:06.472 --> 12:08.807
We'll chew to that depth in seven days.

12:08.891 --> 12:11.894
Add three weeks on top of that
to train everyone here.

12:11.977 --> 12:14.772
We don't have that kind of time,
Ms Woods.

12:14.855 --> 12:17.900
I'm not the only one
with a satellite over Antarctica.

12:17.983 --> 12:20.152
Others will be here soon.

12:20.652 --> 12:25.074
Maybe I wasn't clear.
No one in this room is ready for this trip.

12:25.157 --> 12:27.326
That's why I asked you here.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.954
Bouvetmya is one of
the world's most isolated places.

12:31.038 --> 12:32.581
The nearest land is 1,000 miles away.

12:32.664 --> 12:37.377
- There's no help if we run into trouble.
- You're right. It's a no-man's-land.

12:37.461 --> 12:40.172
But the train has left the station.

12:40.380 --> 12:43.675
And I think I speak
for everyone aboard this ship.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.595
This is worth the risk.

12:55.854 --> 12:57.689
Find another guide.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.961
I've spoken with Mr Weyland.
Money's been wired to your account.

13:19.044 --> 13:21.713
Chopper's refuelling to fly you home.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.342
Who'd you get?

13:27.094 --> 13:28.679
Gerald Murdoch.

13:32.808 --> 13:35.185
- Come in.
- Murdoch has two seasons of ice time.

13:35.269 --> 13:36.895
He's not ready.

13:37.396 --> 13:40.315
- Don't worry about it.
- What about Paul Woodman?

13:40.399 --> 13:41.692
We called him.

13:41.775 --> 13:43.819
He gave the same bullshit answer you did.

13:43.902 --> 13:45.404
"Bullshit"?

13:46.572 --> 13:49.074
What I told you in there wasn't bullshit.

13:49.158 --> 13:53.078
If you rush this, people will get hurt.
Maybe die.

13:53.162 --> 13:54.830
I don't understand.

13:54.913 --> 13:56.832
We're not asking you
to take us up Everest.

13:56.915 --> 14:01.128
We need you to take us from the ship
to the pyramid, and back. That's it.

14:01.211 --> 14:04.173
- What about inside the pyramid?
- Don't worry about that.

14:04.256 --> 14:06.717
Once we're on the site,
we have the best technology

14:06.800 --> 14:08.719
and experts that money can buy.

14:08.802 --> 14:10.596
- Is this new?
- It's the latest.

14:10.679 --> 14:14.600
Mr Weyland, when I lead my team
I don't ever leave my team.

14:15.809 --> 14:18.061
I admire your passion.

14:18.937 --> 14:21.273
I wish you were going with us.

14:22.232 --> 14:24.276
You're making a mistake.

14:31.909 --> 14:34.203
It's in the upper atmosphere.

14:35.871 --> 14:38.582
Streams of protons
and electrons from the sun

14:38.665 --> 14:43.337
being deflected by the earth's magnetic
field, causing a solar radiation storm.

14:43.420 --> 14:47.633
Shackleton called Antarctica
"the last great journey left to man".

14:48.800 --> 14:52.346
It's the one place left in the world
that no one owns.

14:52.429 --> 14:54.306
It's completely free.

14:56.266 --> 14:59.645
Me, I'm sort of partial to the penguins.

15:03.106 --> 15:06.526
I wish you'd reconsider
coming with us, Lex.

15:06.610 --> 15:10.239
Come on, don't make me pull out
pictures of my kids again.

15:10.989 --> 15:13.075
Your kids aren't that cute.

15:13.158 --> 15:16.328
What if we got pictures
of other people's kids?

15:17.496 --> 15:19.164
Want my advice?

15:20.832 --> 15:22.501
Stay on the boat.

15:23.168 --> 15:26.255
OK. Let me ask you something.

15:27.130 --> 15:30.050
Do we stand a better chance
of surviving with you

15:30.133 --> 15:32.386
or with the number-two choice?

15:34.721 --> 15:37.432
Miss Woods, your helicopter's refuelled.

15:37.516 --> 16:45.095
They're waiting for you.

16:45.709 --> 16:47.586
Everybody, listen up!

16:48.170 --> 16:49.713
Gather round.

16:51.173 --> 16:55.010
Told you she'd stay.
She can't resist my animal magnetism.

16:55.302 --> 16:57.512
Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.

16:57.596 --> 16:59.056
Gentlemen?

17:01.016 --> 17:04.269
It is my job to keep you alive
on this expedition,

17:04.770 --> 17:07.064
and I need your help to do that.

17:07.146 --> 17:09.107
Since I don't have time
to properly train you,

17:09.191 --> 17:11.526
I'm laying down three rules.

17:11.609 --> 17:15.030
One. No one goes anywhere alone, ever.

17:16.239 --> 17:17.449
Two.

17:18.617 --> 17:22.119
Everyone must maintain
constant communication.

17:23.288 --> 17:26.458
Three.
Unexpected things are gonna happen.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.920
When they do, no one tries to be a hero.

17:31.129 --> 17:32.547
Understood?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.259
Understood?

17:36.510 --> 17:38.345
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

17:43.892 --> 17:48.063
Seven seasons on the ice and I've never
seen a gun save someone's life.

17:48.146 --> 17:51.274
- I don't plan on using it.
- Then why bring it?

17:51.858 --> 17:54.152
Same principle as a condom.

17:54.236 --> 17:58.407
I'd rather have one and not need it
than need it and not have one.

17:59.616 --> 18:02.077
I'm glad that you decided to stay.

18:04.079 --> 18:06.498
Move the trucks out on the ice.

18:07.290 --> 18:09.751
Move that. OK, let's move.

18:24.141 --> 18:26.935
- What's with the bottle cap?
- What?

18:27.018 --> 18:29.187
What's with the bottle cap?

18:30.897 --> 18:33.859
This is a valuable archaeological find.

18:42.242 --> 18:47.080
When I was a kid growing up in Italy,
you know what they call a moon that big?

18:48.165 --> 18:50.375
<i>La luna del cacciatore.</i>

18:54.463 --> 18:55.714
<i>Brava.</i>

18:56.298 --> 18:58.884
- What's that?
- Hunter's moon.

19:00.093 --> 19:01.803
Hunter's moon.

19:19.863 --> 19:21.656
Hold it, guys.

19:23.742 --> 19:26.661
- Keep those engines running!
- Set it down.

19:28.371 --> 19:30.957
Move over a little further. Connors.

19:50.268 --> 19:52.312
It's an abandoned whaling station.

19:52.395 --> 19:57.275
According to your satellite imagery,
the pyramid is located directly beneath it.

20:11.706 --> 20:14.125
All right, bring it up. Come on.

20:15.168 --> 20:16.628
Spread out.

20:17.546 --> 20:19.881
We'll use this place as a base camp.

20:19.965 --> 20:23.218
Mr Quinn, begin drilling operations
as soon as you can.

20:23.301 --> 20:26.221
I'm on it. OK, guys, let's move out.

21:10.348 --> 21:12.726
- What are these?
- Whale bones.

21:15.770 --> 21:20.233
This station was abandoned in 1904.
Everyone just disappeared overnight.

21:21.109 --> 21:23.612
It was a big mystery back then.

22:14.496 --> 22:16.706
One for National Geographic.

23:00.792 --> 23:04.295
- Lex.
- No one goes anywhere alone.

23:04.796 --> 23:07.674
There's something there. Listen. Listen.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.475
Careful. They bite.

23:29.821 --> 23:31.698
Over here. Over here.

23:32.365 --> 23:33.825
What is it?

23:35.326 --> 23:37.203
Can you believe that?

23:46.379 --> 23:49.257
It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle.

23:50.341 --> 23:54.012
- How far does it go down?
- All the way to the pyramid.

23:54.846 --> 23:58.516
There it is. Clear as day.
And the same time yesterday...

23:59.976 --> 24:02.187
- Nothing.
- How was it done?

24:02.979 --> 24:06.107
- Thermal equipment of some kind.
- Like yours?

24:07.567 --> 24:10.695
More advanced. Incredibly powerful.

24:13.072 --> 24:15.617
I've never seen anything like it.

24:15.700 --> 24:18.286
There's no team
and no machine in the world

24:18.369 --> 24:21.372
that could cut to this depth in 24 hours.

24:21.456 --> 24:23.666
Well, the only way
we're gonna know for sure

24:23.750 --> 24:26.336
is to get down there and find out.

24:49.567 --> 24:51.903
Look at that. Change it. Now!

24:53.404 --> 24:57.075
OK, guys, what's taking so long?
There's a storm coming.

25:07.377 --> 25:10.380
There's no room for sick men
on this expedition.

25:10.463 --> 25:12.465
My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.

25:12.549 --> 25:15.468
You're not a very good liar, Mr Weyland.

25:15.552 --> 25:19.430
Stay on the ship.
We'll update you at the top of every hour.

25:19.514 --> 25:22.225
When you get sick,
you think about your life

25:22.308 --> 25:24.269
and how you're gonna be remembered.

25:24.352 --> 25:28.314
You know what will happen when I go?
Ten per cent fall in share prices.

25:28.398 --> 25:30.483
Maybe 12. That's it.

25:31.609 --> 25:33.903
I've heard this speech before.

25:34.779 --> 25:38.950
My dad broke his leg
700ft from the summit of Mount Rainier.

25:39.576 --> 25:42.954
He was like you.
He wouldn't go back or let us stop.

25:43.580 --> 25:47.458
We reached the top,
and he opened a bottle of champagne.

25:49.627 --> 25:53.214
I had my first drink
with my dad at 14,400ft.

25:55.216 --> 25:59.721
On the way down, he developed a blood
clot in his leg that travelled to his lung.

25:59.804 --> 26:04.142
He suffered for four hours
before dying 20 minutes from the base.

26:05.685 --> 26:09.564
You think that's the last thing
your dad remembers? The pain?

26:10.648 --> 26:14.485
Or drinking champagne
with his daughter 14,000ft in the air?

26:18.239 --> 26:19.699
I need this.

26:28.791 --> 26:30.668
Come on, move.

27:16.923 --> 27:18.049
Shit.

27:23.054 --> 27:24.472
Mr Weyland!

27:24.847 --> 27:26.182
Man down!

27:27.183 --> 27:29.268
Get him! Somebody get him!

27:53.668 --> 27:54.961
Move it!

27:55.044 --> 29:01.790
Now!

29:27.053 --> 29:31.849
I don't understand it.
No equipment. No sign of another team.

29:34.769 --> 29:37.355
Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.

29:39.649 --> 29:42.860
Move it. Connors, get those lights up.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.238
We have power.

30:20.898 --> 30:23.442
Congratulations, Mr Weyland.

30:23.526 --> 30:26.737
Looks like you'll be
leaving your mark after all.

30:30.491 --> 30:32.743
Thank you. Thank you.

30:33.536 --> 30:35.496
Thank you all for this.

30:37.373 --> 32:50.280
Let's make history.

32:47.378 --> 32:48.671
Thomas.

32:50.715 --> 32:52.174
What is it?

32:54.051 --> 32:57.638
- I recognise the Egyptian...
- The second symbol is Aztec.

32:57.722 --> 33:00.683
Pre-conquest era. The third is Cambodian.

33:01.434 --> 33:05.146
Then you were right.
The pyramid contains all three cultures.

33:05.229 --> 33:11.694
- That's what it looks like.
- "You may choose to enter."

33:13.070 --> 33:15.323
"Those who choose may enter."

33:16.032 --> 33:18.326
Who taught you to translate?

33:18.409 --> 33:20.703
Funny. Kinda looked like you.

33:22.621 --> 33:24.999
Well, it's not "choose".

33:26.250 --> 33:27.793
It's "chosen".

33:28.544 --> 33:31.005
"Only the chosen ones may enter."

33:51.275 --> 33:53.611
Quinn, is that you out there?

34:39.466 --> 35:46.253
Mikkel.

36:24.070 --> 36:25.780
What is all this?

36:26.990 --> 36:29.367
This is the sacrificial chamber.

36:34.455 --> 36:36.958
Like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.

36:37.041 --> 36:40.587
Whoever built this pyramid
believed in ritual sacrifice.

36:42.213 --> 36:45.800
This is where the chosen ones
were offered to the gods.

36:55.727 --> 36:58.521
Those that were chosen would lie here.

36:59.355 --> 37:02.191
They weren't bound or tied in any way.

37:02.275 --> 37:04.444
They went to die willingly.

37:05.111 --> 37:06.738
Men and women.

37:09.032 --> 37:11.242
It was considered an honour.

37:12.744 --> 37:14.203
Lucky them.

37:19.586 --> 37:20.795
Oh, God!

37:22.672 --> 37:28.636
It's incredible. The entire skull and
spinal column was removed in one piece.

37:29.512 --> 37:30.972
Look at this.

37:31.681 --> 37:34.392
Look at that. The cleanness of the cut.

37:34.601 --> 37:38.146
Straight through the bone.
There's no abrasions, nothing.

37:51.034 --> 37:54.204
It's probably just air
moving through the tunnels.

37:55.830 --> 37:57.082
Maybe.

38:42.585 --> 38:44.963
Whatever this is, it's been dead a while.

38:45.046 --> 38:47.298
The bones have completely calcified.

38:47.382 --> 38:51.928
No idea how long it's been here,
but the temperatures kept it preserved.

38:52.011 --> 38:54.347
Looks like some kind of scorpion.

38:54.556 --> 38:57.392
No. Climate's too hostile for a scorpion.

38:57.517 --> 38:59.018
Ever seen anything like it?

39:10.414 --> 39:14.961
"They gave their lives
so the hunt could begin."

39:26.222 --> 39:28.057
What happened here?

39:28.474 --> 39:32.103
It's common in ritual sacrifice
to take the heart of the victim.

39:32.186 --> 39:33.646
That's nice.

39:34.313 --> 39:36.899
But that's not where your heart is.

39:38.275 --> 39:41.946
Besides, it looks like the bones
were bent straight out.

39:43.656 --> 39:46.158
Something broke out of this body.

40:39.670 --> 40:43.758
- What have you found, Max?
- It's a shaft to another level.

40:45.551 --> 40:48.471
Looks like there's another room
down there.

41:13.375 --> 41:17.337
- Let's move to that lower room.
- We're moving on, everyone.

41:18.005 --> 41:19.757
Ms Woods.

41:21.800 --> 41:25.679
You, stay here. Rousseau,
you stay with him. Keep a team with you.

41:28.679 --> 41:29.679
Catalogue everything.

41:30.679 --> 41:31.679
Professor.

41:49.831 --> 41:53.376
This should be directly below
the sacrificial chamber.

42:02.093 --> 42:03.553
Sebastian.

42:10.644 --> 42:12.437
It's a sarcophagus.

42:16.149 --> 42:18.235
This is the Long Count.

42:19.527 --> 42:21.696
This is the Aztec calendar.

42:21.988 --> 42:25.033
And this,
it's some kind of combination lock.

42:27.786 --> 42:29.037
"Days."

42:30.705 --> 42:31.998
"Months."

42:32.666 --> 42:33.959
"Years."

42:35.502 --> 42:37.504
The dials are set for...

42:42.842 --> 42:44.344
1904.

42:45.178 --> 42:47.681
Someone opened this 100 years ago?

42:48.390 --> 42:51.017
- What's today's date?
- October 10.

42:51.393 --> 42:53.770
10/10/2004.

42:56.564 --> 42:59.818
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- I don't know.

43:14.582 --> 43:15.834
Back up!

43:37.647 --> 43:40.317
Oh, my God. Take a look at this.

44:06.343 --> 44:08.803
- Any idea what these are?
- No.

44:09.804 --> 44:12.015
- You?
- No.

44:12.307 --> 44:16.478
- It's a good thing we brought the experts.
- Well, yeah. It is a good thing.

44:16.561 --> 44:19.689
Cos this is like finding
Moses' DVD collection.

44:25.779 --> 44:27.155
Weyland?

44:30.200 --> 44:32.494
A little too much excitement.

44:34.537 --> 44:36.831
We've been out long enough for today.

44:36.915 --> 44:38.833
We'll set up base camp
at the whaling station

44:38.917 --> 44:41.419
and get back at it tomorrow morning.

44:41.503 --> 44:45.590
Well, you can go back to the base camp,
Ms Woods, but we're staying here.

44:45.673 --> 44:49.511
No. You wanted to leave
without proper prep. We did.

44:49.594 --> 44:54.307
You wanted to be the first here. We are.
You've claimed the find. It's yours.

44:55.141 --> 44:58.478
Now, we move as a team,
and we're done for the day.

44:59.521 --> 45:01.147
You heard her.

45:02.440 --> 45:05.360
- What do you wanna do with these?
- Take them.

45:05.443 --> 45:07.278
We'll run further tests on the surface.

45:07.362 --> 45:09.948
No. No! Don't touch them.

45:25.547 --> 45:27.966
- Watch out!
- The doors!

45:28.925 --> 45:30.260
The door!

45:50.447 --> 45:52.115
- You OK?
- Yeah.

45:52.782 --> 45:56.077
Slab's gotta weigh two tons.
We'll never move it.

46:38.453 --> 46:41.122
What did you say this room was called?

46:42.123 --> 46:43.917
Sacrificial chamber.

46:58.431 --> 47:01.309
- Rousseau.
- Tommy, come in.

47:01.392 --> 47:03.228
- Come in, Rousseau.
- Come in.

47:03.311 --> 47:07.440
- Is there anything you didn't tell me?
- Nothing. Your guess is as good as mine.

47:07.524 --> 47:09.776
Whatever it is, we're not prepared.

47:09.859 --> 47:14.656
We're gonna round up the rest of the team
and get to the surface. Let's move!

47:17.325 --> 47:21.496
- What are you doing?
- My job. Yours is over.

47:21.829 --> 47:25.250
My job is over when everyone
is back on the boat safely.

47:25.333 --> 47:28.044
And that gun doesn't change anything.

47:42.350 --> 47:44.978
This bearing should take us back
to the entrance.

47:45.061 --> 47:47.272
We'll regroup at the whaling station.

47:47.355 --> 47:49.524
What about Thomas? Rousseau?

47:50.233 --> 47:52.694
- We'll find them on the way up.
- Max?

47:52.777 --> 47:55.196
Stone, Verheiden. Cover our backs.

47:55.280 --> 47:58.950
The heat bloom your satellite detected
makes more sense now.

47:59.033 --> 48:00.285
What do you mean?

48:00.368 --> 48:04.080
A building this sophisticated
requires an energy source.

48:04.789 --> 48:09.460
I think that's what your satellite detected.
A power plant for this pyramid firing up.

48:09.544 --> 48:12.672
- Preparing.
- Preparing? For what?

48:13.214 --> 49:20.210
Gentlemen?

49:42.977 --> 49:44.437
Keep close.

49:56.582 --> 49:59.627
- Recognise what's on their shoulders?
- Yeah.

50:03.548 --> 50:07.260
- We worshipped these things?
- According to this, we did.

50:08.010 --> 50:12.848
And the artefacts you removed from the
sarcophagus seem to be their weapons.

50:17.103 --> 50:20.773
Let's keep moving.
Only another 200 yards to the entrance.

50:42.003 --> 50:43.462
Take cover.

50:44.297 --> 50:45.840
Where's Stone?

50:49.093 --> 50:50.469
Stone!

51:10.781 --> 51:12.992
The pyramid's shifting again.

51:20.875 --> 51:23.252
The doors are closing. Get out.

51:25.838 --> 51:27.089
Come on.

51:27.173 --> 51:28.257
OK. Let's go.

51:28.341 --> 51:30.176
Let's go. Let's go.

51:31.677 --> 51:33.346
Hey! Verheiden!

51:33.638 --> 51:35.014
Verheiden!

51:35.514 --> 51:36.891
Verheiden!

51:38.351 --> 51:39.852
Somebody!

51:40.311 --> 51:41.854
Run! Let's go!

51:42.438 --> 51:43.856
No!

51:43.939 --> 51:45.191
Quickly!

51:46.317 --> 51:48.152
No! No!

52:07.551 --> 52:09.386
I hit that son of a bitch dead on.

52:09.470 --> 52:11.388
It didn't stop, it didn't slow...

52:11.472 --> 52:13.432
- Verheiden.
- It didn't even flinch!

52:13.515 --> 52:15.934
- Verheiden!
- What?

52:16.018 --> 52:19.521
I am not a soldier, but I think
you should calm down now. Really.

52:19.605 --> 52:21.857
We're not dead yet, OK?

52:21.940 --> 52:24.735
Well, thanks, Professor!

52:26.153 --> 52:30.741
Actually, it's Doctor.
And you're welcome. OK?

52:30.824 --> 52:31.950
What?

52:48.258 --> 52:50.969
Hey! Can you hear me?

52:55.057 --> 52:57.184
It's Connors! Where are you?

53:33.220 --> 53:35.848
We're never getting out of this place.

53:37.307 --> 53:39.309
Have you got any children?

53:40.310 --> 53:42.688
- Got a son.
- Yeah? I've got two.

53:42.771 --> 53:46.191
That means that we do not have
the luxury of quitting.

53:46.316 --> 53:48.819
We're gonna make it outta here.

53:49.987 --> 53:53.657
We're surviving this
if I have to carry you the whole way.

54:01.081 --> 54:03.292
There's no way out back there.

54:07.379 --> 54:09.006
No damage.

54:13.093 --> 54:15.095
One of our men is dead.

54:25.022 --> 54:27.691
I need to know what this man died for.

54:29.318 --> 54:31.695
He died trying to make history.

54:34.990 --> 54:37.534
Whose? Yours?

54:50.839 --> 54:52.841
- What's that?
- Just a theory.

54:53.592 --> 54:57.721
The Aztec calendar was metric.
Based on multiples of ten.

54:59.181 --> 55:02.726
I'm guessing the pyramid
reconfigures every ten minutes.

55:25.750 --> 55:27.585
Let's stick together.

55:32.674 --> 55:33.967
Weyland.

55:39.305 --> 55:43.977
It would seem that we are rats in a maze.

55:48.272 --> 55:49.524
Sorry.

56:27.645 --> 56:29.689
Connors? Connors!

56:44.954 --> 56:47.165
Verheiden? Verheiden?

56:47.498 --> 56:50.626
- Oh, God.
- Dr Miller! Get me outta here!

56:50.710 --> 56:54.172
It's OK. I'm gonna find a way
to get down to you. OK?

56:58.259 --> 56:59.427
Verheiden!

56:59.510 --> 57:00.928
No!

57:21.157 --> 57:25.119
You want a piece of me?
You ugly son of a bitch!

57:37.590 --> 57:38.883
Oh, God.

58:03.950 --> 58:05.159
Weyland.

58:05.243 --> 58:07.995
<i>- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

58:10.790 --> 58:13.417
Leave it. They can only slow us down.

58:13.501 --> 58:16.754
Too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing.

58:19.715 --> 58:21.259
Give it to me.

58:39.360 --> 58:40.653
Max.

58:45.616 --> 58:46.868
Hold on.

58:46.951 --> 58:48.369
Look out!

01:00:26.854 --> 01:00:29.314
Come on. We have to get Weyland.

01:00:36.405 --> 01:02:49.187
Weyland, come on.

01:03:17.232 --> 01:03:19.985
- What were they?
- You're the expert.

01:03:20.068 --> 01:03:22.612
I've got to stop. I've got to stop.

01:03:25.907 --> 01:03:27.993
Take it easy. Weyland.

01:03:28.744 --> 01:03:30.495
Look at me.

01:03:30.579 --> 01:03:33.165
You have to slow your breathing down.

01:03:33.248 --> 01:03:35.375
Slow, steady breaths.

01:03:41.214 --> 01:03:43.467
- Weyland, come on.
- I can hardly stand.

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:45.886
I'm not gonna let you die down here.

01:03:45.969 --> 01:03:47.429
You didn't.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.931
There's another one.

01:03:50.015 --> 01:03:52.851
- We have to go. Now!
- Weyland.

01:03:52.934 --> 01:03:55.187
- Come with us.
- Get her outta here.

01:03:55.854 --> 01:03:57.564
- Now!
- Come on.

01:03:58.482 --> 01:03:59.608
Run!

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:30.639
Don't turn your back on me.

01:04:46.663 --> 01:04:48.790
- I'm going back.
- No, wait!

01:05:02.262 --> 01:05:04.014
You can't help him.

01:05:04.889 --> 01:05:09.185
We have to go. We keep it together,
we'll make it to the surface.

01:05:10.145 --> 01:05:11.438
Let's go.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.607
Let's go.

01:05:18.653 --> 01:05:20.739
<i>We keep it together, we'll make it...</i>

01:05:20.822 --> 01:05:23.116
<i>...keep it together,
we'll make it to the surface.</i>

01:05:23.199 --> 01:05:25.952
<i>...we'll make it to the surface.</i>

01:05:28.339 --> 01:05:29.548
Wait.

01:05:37.973 --> 01:05:39.433
This way.

01:05:45.356 --> 01:06:53.895
Go! Go!

01:07:08.188 --> 01:07:09.773
Look over here.

01:07:38.218 --> 01:07:40.971
- He's marking himself.
- What?

01:07:41.347 --> 01:07:45.559
Ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill.

01:07:46.185 --> 01:07:48.062
It's a rite of passage.

01:07:53.318 --> 01:07:55.612
This is starting to make sense.

01:08:03.536 --> 01:08:06.831
I think this is a manhood ritual.

01:08:08.333 --> 01:08:10.043
The humanoid ones,

01:08:10.543 --> 01:08:14.506
they've been sent here
to prove they're worthy to become adults.

01:08:15.965 --> 01:08:20.345
You're saying they're, what... teenagers?

01:08:24.933 --> 01:08:28.353
That's why they didn't carry
those guns to begin with.

01:08:28.435 --> 01:08:30.354
They have to earn them.

01:08:42.783 --> 01:08:45.161
The hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out.

01:08:45.245 --> 01:08:47.330
But the story is all here.

01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:56.046
<i>Thousands of years ago,
these hunters found a backwater planet.</i>

01:09:02.845 --> 01:09:08.184
<i>They taught humans how to build
and were worshipped as gods.</i>

01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:16.276
<i>Every hundred years
the gods would return.</i>

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:23.658
<i>And when they did,
they would expect a sacrifice.</i>

01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:27.714
<i>Humans were used
to breed the ultimate prey.</i>

01:09:36.889 --> 01:09:40.310
<i>The hunters would battle
with these great serpents</i>

01:09:40.393 --> 01:09:43.729
<i>to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark.</i>

01:10:01.039 --> 01:10:03.082
<i>But if the hunters lost,</i>

01:10:03.583 --> 01:10:06.002
<i>they made sure nothing survived.</i>

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:14.010
An entire civilisation wiped out overnight.

01:10:17.722 --> 01:10:18.973
So...

01:10:19.724 --> 01:10:21.934
the humanoids, the hunters -

01:10:23.227 --> 01:10:25.521
they brought those creatures
here to hunt?

01:10:25.605 --> 01:10:27.732
And they use us like cattle.

01:10:28.566 --> 01:10:31.069
We're hosts for them to breed in.

01:10:31.653 --> 01:10:34.864
The heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here.

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:37.408
This whole thing was a trap.

01:10:38.951 --> 01:10:41.496
Without us, there could be no hunt.

01:11:10.775 --> 01:11:11.943
Shit!

01:11:12.485 --> 01:11:13.945
Verheiden!

01:11:54.986 --> 01:11:56.320
Oh, shit.

01:12:01.409 --> 01:12:03.911
When that door opens, we're dead.

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:07.749
- Not if we set things right.
- What do you mean?

01:12:07.832 --> 01:12:10.668
This pyramid is like a prison.

01:12:12.086 --> 01:12:15.798
We took the guards' guns,
and now the prisoners are running free.

01:12:15.882 --> 01:12:19.010
To restore order,
the guards need their guns.

01:12:21.137 --> 01:12:25.516
When that door opens,
we're gonna give that thing his gun back.

01:12:26.225 --> 01:12:28.478
Are you crazy? During a big-game hunt,

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:30.855
the animals being hunted
don't arm the hunters.

01:12:30.938 --> 01:12:34.525
They're not hunting us.
We're in the middle of a war.

01:12:34.609 --> 01:12:37.820
- It's time to pick a side.
- We are on our side.

01:12:39.447 --> 01:12:44.035
We have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here.

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:50.374
But we have to make sure
those serpents don't reach the surface.

01:12:51.626 --> 01:12:53.419
Because if they do,

01:12:54.462 --> 01:12:56.839
everything everywhere could die.

01:13:01.052 --> 01:13:03.137
The enemy of my enemy...

01:13:04.222 --> 01:13:05.765
is my friend.

01:13:29.247 --> 01:13:31.332
Let's go find our friend.

01:13:41.801 --> 01:13:44.470
How do you say
"scared shitless" in Italian?

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:49.517
<i>Non vedo I'ora di uscire con te da questa
piramide perché mi sto cagando addosso.</i>

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.102
More or less.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.126
Move!

01:14:38.983 --> 01:14:40.151
Lex.

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:43.988
Lex.

01:14:44.488 --> 01:14:45.740
Hold on.

01:14:46.324 --> 01:14:47.867
Come on, Lex.

01:14:54.415 --> 01:16:01.286
Oh, no.

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:53.284
Wait. Wait. Please, wait.

01:16:57.872 --> 01:17:00.458
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

01:17:03.127 --> 01:19:16.493
<i>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.</i>

01:19:06.292 --> 01:20:15.164
I'm coming with you.
You hear me, you ugly creature?

01:20:03.942 --> 01:22:16.724
What are you doing?

01:22:30.891 --> 01:22:32.226
Miller!

01:22:41.610 --> 01:23:48.439
Miller!

01:23:33.787 --> 01:23:35.122
Sebastian.

01:23:36.081 --> 01:23:38.917
- Help me, Lex.
- I'm gonna get you out of there.

01:23:39.001 --> 01:23:42.504
- It's too late. It's inside me.
- I'm gonna get you outta here.

01:23:42.588 --> 01:23:44.340
- You can't...
- No!

01:23:44.882 --> 01:23:47.968
No.No.No!No!

01:23:48.052 --> 01:23:49.845
I have to help him.

01:23:53.474 --> 01:23:54.725
Lex!

01:23:55.142 --> 01:23:57.519
They mustn't reach the surface.

01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:00.356
They mustn't reach the surface.

01:24:01.148 --> 01:24:02.399
I know.

01:24:11.617 --> 01:24:12.826
Do it!

01:24:17.164 --> 01:25:24.535
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:25:39.288 --> 01:25:40.789
It's a bomb.

01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:44.668
Well, I hope it kills
every fucking one of 'em.

01:26:29.671 --> 01:32:00.146
You are one ugly mother...

01:32:00.585 --> 01:48:24.835
Got it!

01:48:38.457 --> 01:48:39.500
