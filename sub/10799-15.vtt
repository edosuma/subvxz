of a Kerr loop

06:38.333 --> 06:39.834

09:55.083 --> 09:57.166
to evacuate this ship.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.417
No, I think I can do it.

09:58.458 --> 09:59.792
I'll have to get

09:58.458 --> 09:59.792
to Engineering though.

09:59.834 --> 10:01.333
La Forge to Damage

09:59.834 --> 10:01.333
Control Team Alpha.

10:01.375 --> 10:04.000
Meet me on Engineering

10:01.375 --> 10:04.000
level three.

10:04.041 --> 10:04.875
Commander...

10:04.917 --> 10:06.875
(<i> coughing</i> )

10:09.917 --> 10:13.583
(<i> panting and coughing</i> )

10:15.834 --> 10:18.000
Thanks.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.834
Commander William Riker.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.583
Lieutenant Castillo.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.583
Helmsman.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.250
(<i> panting</i> )

10:27.417 --> 10:28.750
DATA:

10:27.417 --> 10:28.750
Away team reporting in, Captain.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.166
On screen.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.709
Go ahead, Commander.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.709
RIKER:

10:32.750 --> 10:34.709
We've stabilized life-support.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.250
Mr. La Forge is working

10:34.750 --> 10:36.250
on restoring

10:36.291 --> 10:39.250
the main power couplings,

10:36.291 --> 10:39.250
but that'll take time.

10:39.291 --> 10:40.959
It's a real mess

10:39.291 --> 10:40.959
down here, sir.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.333
Survivors?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.250
One hundred twenty-five.

10:44.291 --> 10:45.417
Recommendations?

10:45.458 --> 10:46.959
I'd hate to have to scrap her.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.208
Starfleet could certainly

10:47.041 --> 10:49.208
use another ship,

10:49.250 --> 10:50.709
even if she is old.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.125
Agreed, but we can't stay

10:50.750 --> 10:54.125
in this area too long.

10:54.166 --> 10:55.333
You have nine hours.

10:55.375 --> 10:56.500
If you can get her underway

10:55.375 --> 10:56.500
by then,

10:56.542 --> 10:58.333
we'll escort her

10:56.542 --> 10:58.333
to Starbase 105.

10:58.375 --> 11:01.083
If not, we'll evacuate

10:58.375 --> 11:01.083
the survivors

11:01.125 --> 11:02.291
and destroy the ship.

11:02.333 --> 11:03.834
Understood, sir.

11:03.875 --> 11:04.834
Keep me posted.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.166
Picard out.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.834
PICARD:

11:15.917 --> 11:17.834
Guinan?

11:20.875 --> 11:22.625
We need to talk.

11:22.667 --> 11:26.166
Somehow this...

11:22.667 --> 11:26.166
this is all wrong.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.792
This is not the way

11:27.375 --> 11:29.792
it's supposed to be.

11:38.667 --> 11:41.125
But you must have some idea

11:38.667 --> 11:41.125
how things have changed.

11:41.166 --> 11:44.250
I look at things,

11:41.166 --> 11:44.250
I look at people and...

11:44.291 --> 11:46.417
they just don't feel right.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.000
What things, what people?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.417
You.

11:50.458 --> 11:53.208
Your uniform,

11:50.458 --> 11:53.208
the Bridge.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.500
What's the matter

11:53.250 --> 11:55.500
with the Bridge?

11:55.542 --> 11:57.625
It's not right.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.625
It's the same Bridge.

11:57.667 --> 11:58.667
Nothing has changed.

11:58.709 --> 11:59.917
I know that.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.875
I also know it's wrong.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.500
(<i> sighs</i> )

12:06.542 --> 12:07.750
What else?

12:07.792 --> 12:09.333
Families.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.041
There should be children

12:09.375 --> 12:11.041
on this ship.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.709
What?!

12:12.750 --> 12:14.750
Children on the<i> Enterprise?</i>

12:16.583 --> 12:17.583
Guinan, we're at war.

12:17.625 --> 12:20.709
No, we're not.

12:20.750 --> 12:23.875
At least,

12:20.750 --> 12:23.875
we're not supposed to be.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.750
This is not a ship of war.

12:26.792 --> 12:29.125
This is a ship

12:26.792 --> 12:29.125
of peace.

12:40.375 --> 12:41.667
What you're suggesting...

12:41.709 --> 12:43.166
I'm not suggesting.

12:43.208 --> 12:46.834
That ship from the past

12:43.208 --> 12:46.834
is not supposed to be here.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.750
It's got to go back.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.208
MAN:

12:52.166 --> 12:53.208
Get a radiation level.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.250

12:55.291 --> 12:57.000
CRUSHER:

12:55.291 --> 12:57.000
Run a full electrolyte report.

12:57.041 --> 12:58.709
MAN:

12:57.041 --> 12:58.709
These organs do

12:57.041 --> 12:58.709
seem to be active.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.333
MAN 2:

12:58.750 --> 13:01.333
Right.

13:01.375 --> 13:02.709
Need a new control specimen.

13:02.750 --> 13:05.458
CRUSHER:

13:02.750 --> 13:05.458
Boost the level

13:02.750 --> 13:05.458
of tricordrazine.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.917
Try to relax.

13:07.959 --> 13:11.959
WOMAN (<i> over loudspeaker</i> ):

13:07.959 --> 13:11.959
Dr. Salar, report

13:07.959 --> 13:11.959

13:12.000 --> 13:14.959
Dr. Salar,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.959
report to Null-G ward, STAT.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.959
I'm Captain

13:18.333 --> 13:20.959
Jean-Luc Picard.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.458
Rachel Garrett.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.083
How's my ship?

13:24.125 --> 13:26.667
The support systems

13:24.125 --> 13:26.667
are being restored.

13:27.834 --> 13:30.125
We're continuing

13:27.834 --> 13:30.125
repairs.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.583
Where did you come from?

13:31.625 --> 13:32.875
We weren't picking up

13:32.917 --> 13:35.041
any other Federation ships

13:32.917 --> 13:35.041
in this sector.

13:38.917 --> 13:41.792
What's the last thing

13:38.917 --> 13:41.792
you remember?

13:41.834 --> 13:43.959
We were answering

13:41.834 --> 13:43.959
the distress signal.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.583
Distress signal?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.667
You must have heard it.

13:47.709 --> 13:51.834
From the Klingon outpost,

13:47.709 --> 13:51.834
Narendra III.

13:56.041 --> 13:58.834
But you didn't, did you?

14:02.917 --> 14:05.875
This Sick Bay,

14:02.917 --> 14:05.875
I've never seen anything like it

14:05.917 --> 14:07.458
even on a Starbase.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.417
And your uniforms.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.333
What ship is this, Captain?

14:15.792 --> 14:17.500
Please try to be still.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.083
GARRETT:

14:18.959 --> 14:20.083
I must insist.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.583
What ship?

14:23.709 --> 14:25.917
(<i> sighs</i> )

14:25.959 --> 14:28.625
You're aboard the

14:25.959 --> 14:28.625
<i>Enterprise,</i> Captain.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.709
1701-D.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.625
You have come 22 years

14:36.458 --> 14:38.625
into the future.

14:41.125 --> 14:42.709
22 years?

14:45.208 --> 14:46.291
Does my crew know yet?

14:46.333 --> 14:47.500
No.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.500
I must tell them.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.500
I owe them that.

14:49.542 --> 14:52.542
If you wish, I can see

14:49.542 --> 14:52.542
that they're informed.

14:52.583 --> 14:54.875
Is there some reason

14:52.583 --> 14:54.875
they should not be told?

14:54.917 --> 14:58.291
I am concerned that if you

14:54.917 --> 14:58.291
return to your own time

14:58.333 --> 14:59.875
with knowledge of the future...

14:59.917 --> 15:01.000
Return to the battle?

15:01.041 --> 15:03.625
We barely escaped

15:01.041 --> 15:03.625
with our lives.

15:03.667 --> 15:06.250
If we returned,

15:03.667 --> 15:06.250
we'd be destroyed.

15:07.417 --> 15:09.667
Have you any idea

15:07.417 --> 15:09.667
how this happened?

15:12.500 --> 15:16.250
There was a... fierce volley

15:12.500 --> 15:16.250
of photon torpedoes.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.375
We were hit.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.125
A bright light, and then here.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.333
It is possible

15:21.166 --> 15:23.333
that this exchange of fire

15:23.375 --> 15:24.709
was the catalyst

15:24.750 --> 15:28.000
for the formation

15:24.750 --> 15:28.000
of a temporal rift.

15:28.041 --> 15:32.625
History has no record of your

15:28.041 --> 15:32.625
battle with the Romulans.

15:32.667 --> 15:35.417
We were responding

15:32.667 --> 15:35.417
to a distress call

15:35.458 --> 15:38.959
from the Klingon outpost

15:35.458 --> 15:38.959
on Narendra III.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.917
The Romulans were attacking it.

15:40.959 --> 15:43.166
We engaged them,

15:43.208 --> 15:45.333
but there were

15:43.208 --> 15:45.333
four warbirds.

15:45.375 --> 15:48.417
The Narendra III outpost

15:45.375 --> 15:48.417
was destroyed.

15:48.458 --> 15:49.959
It is regrettable

15:50.000 --> 15:52.458
that you did

15:50.000 --> 15:52.458
not succeed.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.166
A Federation starship

15:54.208 --> 15:57.500
rescuing

15:54.208 --> 15:57.500
a Klingon outpost

15:57.542 --> 16:00.125
might have averted

15:57.542 --> 16:00.125
20 years of war.

16:11.917 --> 16:14.250
I still can't quite

16:11.917 --> 16:14.250
make myself believe it.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.917
22 years.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.166
I'm reading 40 percent

16:16.959 --> 16:19.166
on forward shields.

16:19.208 --> 16:20.834
What do you have on aft?

16:20.875 --> 16:22.041
40 percent.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.250
That won't cut it.

16:23.291 --> 16:25.500
Commander,

16:23.291 --> 16:25.500
advise Lieutenant La Forge

16:25.542 --> 16:26.792
that shields are

16:25.542 --> 16:26.792
below minimum.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.125
Acknowledged.

16:32.458 --> 16:36.291
We'll never see our homes again,

16:32.458 --> 16:36.291
our families.

16:36.333 --> 16:39.625
How do you know your

16:36.333 --> 16:39.625
family's not still alive?

16:39.667 --> 16:43.291
You're right, I don't.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.250
But imagine coming home

16:43.333 --> 16:46.250
after 22 years.

16:46.291 --> 16:49.041
Would I even

16:46.291 --> 16:49.041
recognize them?

16:49.083 --> 16:51.750
What are the stats

16:49.083 --> 16:51.750
on the main phaser banks?

16:51.792 --> 16:55.750
Emitters available,

16:51.792 --> 16:55.750
60% forward, 52% aft.

16:55.792 --> 16:58.750
Good. Let's take a look

16:55.792 --> 16:58.750
at the torpedo launchers.

17:14.041 --> 17:16.625
I guess I'm lucky

17:14.041 --> 17:16.625
to be alive at all.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.125
You may not

17:16.667 --> 17:18.125
like the future.

17:18.166 --> 17:20.667
It's been a long war.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.041
The Federation has lost

17:22.083 --> 17:25.834
more than half of Starfleet

17:22.083 --> 17:25.834
to the Klingons.

17:25.875 --> 17:29.000
We were negotiating

17:25.875 --> 17:29.000
a peace treaty when I left.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.375
A lot of changes,

17:29.041 --> 17:31.375
Lieutenant.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.959
A<i> lot</i> of changes.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.625
When we get a break,

17:36.250 --> 17:38.625
maybe you could

17:38.667 --> 17:40.667
fill me in

17:38.667 --> 17:40.667
on some of them.

17:43.750 --> 17:46.500
Photon banks

17:43.750 --> 17:46.500
are depleted.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.208
Auxiliary fusion

17:46.542 --> 17:48.208
generators are down.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.667
There is a high degree

17:52.625 --> 17:54.667
of probability

17:54.709 --> 17:56.709
that the temporal rift

17:54.709 --> 17:56.709
is symmetrical, Captain.

17:56.750 --> 17:59.458
PICARD:

17:56.750 --> 17:59.458
Then what would happen

17:56.750 --> 17:59.458
if the<i> Enterprise-C</i> were

17:59.500 --> 18:01.041
to fly back

17:59.500 --> 18:01.041
through it?

18:01.083 --> 18:02.917
Back, sir?

18:02.959 --> 18:05.417
The<i> Enterprise-C</i> would

18:02.959 --> 18:05.417
emerge in her own time

18:05.458 --> 18:07.500
at almost the same

18:05.458 --> 18:07.500
instant she left.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.750
Right in the middle

18:07.542 --> 18:09.750
of the battle with the Romulans.

18:09.792 --> 18:11.333
Yes, sir.

18:11.375 --> 18:14.375
Is there any possibility

18:11.375 --> 18:14.375
she could survive?

18:14.417 --> 18:16.000
None, sir.

18:16.041 --> 18:20.000
Then sending them back

18:16.041 --> 18:20.000
would be a death sentence.

18:38.208 --> 18:41.291
over 6,000 troops.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.500
How long have you

18:41.333 --> 18:42.500
been on board?

18:42.542 --> 18:43.917
Four years.

18:43.959 --> 18:46.041
Straight out

18:43.959 --> 18:46.041
of the academy.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.417
I was lucky to get

18:47.250 --> 18:49.417
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

18:49.458 --> 18:50.875
Yeah, me, too.

18:50.917 --> 18:52.709
I mean, my<i> Enterprise.</i>

18:56.333 --> 18:59.959
WOMAN (<i> on loudspeaker):</i>

18:56.333 --> 18:59.959
Triage Team Two

18:56.333 --> 18:59.959
to Main Shuttle Bay.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.667
Triage Team Two...

19:05.542 --> 19:07.709
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

19:07.750 --> 19:10.542
Lieutenant, how's the ship?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.834
We've restored

19:10.583 --> 19:11.834
minimal shields

19:11.875 --> 19:13.583
and the forward

19:11.875 --> 19:13.583
phaser banks.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.542
Still no photon launchers

19:13.625 --> 19:16.542
or warp drive.

19:16.583 --> 19:19.000
Concentrate

19:16.583 --> 19:19.000
on the weapon system.

19:19.041 --> 19:20.458
From what Captain Picard

19:19.041 --> 19:20.458
told me,

19:20.500 --> 19:22.875
the Federation can use

19:20.500 --> 19:22.875
all the help it can get.

19:22.917 --> 19:24.208
YAR:

19:22.917 --> 19:24.208
And soon.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.208
Our sensors have picked

19:24.250 --> 19:26.208
up Klingon warships

19:26.250 --> 19:27.500
in this sector, Captain.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.041
Why wasn't I informed,

19:27.542 --> 19:29.041
Mr. Castillo?

19:29.083 --> 19:30.166
Captain, you shouldn't...

19:30.208 --> 19:31.458
As senior officer,

19:30.208 --> 19:31.458
I want you to be

19:31.500 --> 19:33.917
my liaison

19:31.500 --> 19:33.917
to the<i> Enterprise-D.</i>

19:33.959 --> 19:35.000
Coordinate

19:33.959 --> 19:35.000
with tactical.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.166
YAR:

19:35.041 --> 19:36.166
That's me, Captain.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.041
Where do you think

19:36.208 --> 19:38.041
you're going?

19:38.083 --> 19:39.875
I am resuming

19:38.083 --> 19:39.875
my duties, Doctor.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.291
Captain, you need at least

19:39.917 --> 19:42.291
another 24 hours.

19:42.333 --> 19:45.000
Nonsense, doctors always

19:42.333 --> 19:45.000
overprotect their patients.

19:45.041 --> 19:47.834
And Captains always push

19:45.041 --> 19:47.834
themselves too hard.

19:47.875 --> 19:51.917
Doctor, my ship

19:47.875 --> 19:51.917
and my crew need me now.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.458
24 hours might as well

19:51.959 --> 19:54.458
be 24 years.

19:56.709 --> 19:58.375
(<i> door opens</i> )

20:05.291 --> 20:06.792
I need more.

20:06.834 --> 20:09.000
There is no more.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.125
I wish there were.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.959
I wish I could prove it,

20:11.166 --> 20:13.959
but I can't.

20:15.667 --> 20:18.125
Then I can't

20:15.667 --> 20:18.125
ask them to go back.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.583
You've got to.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.834
Guinan, they will die

20:21.500 --> 20:24.834
moments after they return.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.000
How can I ask them

20:24.875 --> 20:27.000
to sacrifice themselves

20:27.041 --> 20:28.959
based solely on your intuition?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.417
I don't know.

20:31.458 --> 20:34.375
But I do know

20:31.458 --> 20:34.375
that this is a mistake.

20:34.417 --> 20:38.375
Every fiber in my being says

20:34.417 --> 20:38.375
<i>this</i> is a mistake.

20:38.417 --> 20:41.417
I can't explain it to myself,

20:38.417 --> 20:41.417
so I can't explain it to you.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.875
I only know that I'm right.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.375
Who is to say

20:46.375 --> 20:48.375
that this history

20:48.417 --> 20:50.834
is any less proper

20:48.417 --> 20:50.834
than the other?

20:50.875 --> 20:52.166
I suppose I am.

20:52.208 --> 20:54.417
Not good enough, damn it,

20:52.208 --> 20:54.417
not good enough!

20:54.458 --> 20:56.792
I will not ask

20:54.458 --> 20:56.792
them to die!

20:56.834 --> 20:59.000
40 billion people

20:56.834 --> 20:59.000
have already died.

20:59.041 --> 21:00.875
This war is not supposed

20:59.041 --> 21:00.875
to be happening.

21:00.917 --> 21:03.375
You've got to send those people

21:00.917 --> 21:03.375
back to correct this.

21:03.417 --> 21:06.000
And what is to guarantee that if

21:03.417 --> 21:06.000
they go back, they will succeed?

21:09.834 --> 21:12.083
Every instinct is telling me

21:09.834 --> 21:12.083
this is wrong,

21:12.125 --> 21:14.458
it is dangerous,

21:12.125 --> 21:14.458
it is futile!

21:16.625 --> 21:19.917
We've known each other

21:16.625 --> 21:19.917
a long time.

21:19.959 --> 21:23.875
You have never known me

21:19.959 --> 21:23.875
to impose myself on anyone

21:23.917 --> 21:26.542
or take a stance

21:23.917 --> 21:26.542
based on trivial

21:26.583 --> 21:29.125
or whimsical perceptions.

21:29.166 --> 21:32.208
This timeline must not

21:29.166 --> 21:32.208
be allowed to continue.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.625
Now, I've told you

21:32.250 --> 21:35.625
what you must do.

21:35.667 --> 21:40.083
You have only your trust in me

21:35.667 --> 21:40.083
to help you decide to do it.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.417
(<i> door closes</i> )

21:50.583 --> 21:53.125
I mean, deflector

21:50.583 --> 21:53.125
shield technology

21:53.166 --> 21:55.917
has advanced considerably

21:53.166 --> 21:55.917
during the war.

21:55.959 --> 21:58.667
Our heat-dissipation

21:55.959 --> 21:58.667
rates are probably double

21:58.709 --> 22:00.375
those of the<i> Enterprise-C.</i>

22:00.417 --> 22:03.667
Which means we can hang in

22:00.417 --> 22:03.667
a firefight a lot longer.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.000
Guinan?

22:10.625 --> 22:11.875
Have you ordered yet, Tasha?

22:11.917 --> 22:14.125
No, not yet.

22:16.417 --> 22:17.458
Is anything wrong?

22:17.500 --> 22:19.208
Not a thing.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.458
What can I get for you?

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
Just a couple of T-K-Ls.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.083
We're in a hurry.

22:25.125 --> 22:26.959
Oh, this is

22:25.125 --> 22:26.959
Lieutenant Castillo.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.458
Mm.

22:40.083 --> 22:41.875
First time for everything.

22:41.917 --> 22:43.291
First time?

22:45.542 --> 22:48.125
It's just that I've never seen

22:45.542 --> 22:48.125
anything bother her before.

22:49.625 --> 22:52.125
What's a T-K-L?

22:52.166 --> 22:53.500
Standard rations.

22:53.542 --> 22:55.625
Food replicators

22:53.542 --> 22:55.625
are on minimum power

22:55.667 --> 22:59.041
so everything else is diverted

22:55.667 --> 22:59.041
to the defensive systems.

22:59.083 --> 23:01.083
So where was I?

23:01.125 --> 23:03.750
You've told me more

23:01.125 --> 23:03.750
about tactical in an hour

23:03.792 --> 23:05.959
than I learned in my last year

23:03.792 --> 23:05.959
at the academy.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.667
You're going to

23:06.000 --> 23:07.667
need it, Lieutenant.

23:07.709 --> 23:09.709
Hey...

23:09.750 --> 23:12.166
I've known you

23:09.750 --> 23:12.166
a whole day now, Lieutenant.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.542
I won't salute if you won't.

23:14.667 --> 23:17.041
What did she

23:14.667 --> 23:17.041
call you-- Tasha?

23:17.083 --> 23:18.458
Yeah.

23:20.208 --> 23:22.500
Most everyone

23:20.208 --> 23:22.500
calls me Castillo.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.709
My mother calls me Richard.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.875
Okay, Castillo.

23:29.375 --> 23:32.041
No, I think maybe

23:29.375 --> 23:32.041
I'd like it better

23:32.083 --> 23:33.834
if you called me Richard.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.083
Richard.

23:39.125 --> 23:40.125
PICARD:

23:39.125 --> 23:40.125
This is the Captain.

23:40.166 --> 23:41.625
Senior officers will report

23:41.667 --> 23:43.875
to my ready room

23:41.667 --> 23:43.875
immediately.

23:43.917 --> 23:45.792
So much for lunch.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.750
Captain, are you suggesting

24:04.166 --> 24:06.750
that we let them return

24:06.792 --> 24:08.375
and attempt to complete

24:06.792 --> 24:08.375
their mission?

24:08.417 --> 24:10.375
I am, Doctor.

24:10.417 --> 24:12.750
Based on Guinan's

24:10.417 --> 24:12.750
intuition?

24:12.792 --> 24:14.208
That won't accomplish

24:12.792 --> 24:14.208
anything, sir.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.166
There's no way they can save

24:14.250 --> 24:16.166
Narendra III.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.667
Captain Garrett said there

24:16.208 --> 24:18.667
were four Romulan warbirds.

24:18.709 --> 24:21.166
The<i> Enterprise-C</i> would be

24:18.709 --> 24:21.166
outmanned and outgunned.

24:21.208 --> 24:22.625
Unless we were

24:21.208 --> 24:22.625
to re-arm them

24:22.667 --> 24:24.208
with modern...

24:22.667 --> 24:24.208
PICARD:

24:22.667 --> 24:24.208
We can't do that.

24:24.250 --> 24:25.917
If we send that ship back

24:24.250 --> 24:25.917
with new technology,

24:25.959 --> 24:27.417
we'll be altering the past.

24:27.458 --> 24:28.542
RIKER:

24:27.458 --> 24:28.542
But that's what you're

24:27.458 --> 24:28.542
talking about anyway,

24:28.583 --> 24:29.875
isn't it-- altering the past?

24:29.917 --> 24:32.291
We're talking

24:29.917 --> 24:32.291
about restoring the past.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.458
But how could Guinan know

24:32.333 --> 24:34.458
that history's been altered

24:34.500 --> 24:36.500
if she's been altered

24:34.500 --> 24:36.500
along with the rest of us?

24:36.542 --> 24:38.250
Perhaps her species

24:36.542 --> 24:38.250
has a perception

24:38.291 --> 24:40.041
that goes beyond

24:38.291 --> 24:40.041
linear time.

24:40.083 --> 24:41.792
PICARD:

24:40.083 --> 24:41.792
There are many things

24:40.083 --> 24:41.792
about her species

24:41.834 --> 24:43.417
we can't easily explain.

24:43.458 --> 24:45.417
Yet, it is very possible

24:43.458 --> 24:45.417
that she is correct.

24:45.458 --> 24:49.083
A ship from the past

24:45.458 --> 24:49.083
has traveled through time.

24:49.125 --> 24:50.750
How can we know

24:49.125 --> 24:50.750
what effect those events

24:50.792 --> 24:52.041
will have on the present?

24:52.083 --> 24:53.917
Indeed, we shall never

24:52.083 --> 24:53.917
know for certain

24:53.959 --> 24:55.500
if Guinan is correct,

24:55.542 --> 24:58.291
but I have decided the

24:55.542 --> 24:58.291
consequences of that possibility

24:58.333 --> 25:00.083
are too grave to ignore.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.667
Dismissed.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.500
RIKER:

25:02.709 --> 25:04.500
Sir, if you'd

25:02.709 --> 25:04.500
like my opinion...

25:04.542 --> 25:06.834
I think I'm aware

25:04.542 --> 25:06.834
of your opinion, Commander.

25:06.875 --> 25:07.875
This is a briefing.

25:07.917 --> 25:09.417
I'm not seeking your consent.

25:09.458 --> 25:11.041
With all due respect, sir

25:11.083 --> 25:15.000
you'd be asking 125 people

25:11.083 --> 25:15.000
to die a meaningless death.

25:15.041 --> 25:16.792
DATA:

25:15.041 --> 25:16.792
Not necessarily

25:15.041 --> 25:16.792
meaningless, Commander.

25:16.834 --> 25:19.500
The Klingons regard honor

25:16.834 --> 25:19.500
above all else.

25:19.542 --> 25:21.834
If the crew

25:19.542 --> 25:21.834
of the<i> Enterprise-C</i> had died

25:21.875 --> 25:24.250
fighting for the survival

25:21.875 --> 25:24.250
of a Klingon outpost,

25:24.291 --> 25:26.417
it would be considered

25:24.291 --> 25:26.417
a meaningful act of honor

25:26.458 --> 25:27.917
by the Klingon Empire.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.917
Even their deaths could have

25:27.959 --> 25:30.917
prevented this war.

25:32.291 --> 25:34.583
If the<i> Enterprise-C</i>

25:32.291 --> 25:34.583
returns to the battle

25:34.625 --> 25:36.291
and its mission is a success,

25:36.333 --> 25:38.333
history will be

25:36.333 --> 25:38.333
irrevocably changed.

25:38.375 --> 25:40.542
This timeline will

25:38.375 --> 25:40.542
cease to exist,

25:40.583 --> 25:42.625
and a new future will

25:40.583 --> 25:42.625
have been created.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.291
I've considered

25:42.667 --> 25:45.291
the alternatives.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.834
I'll go with Guinan's

25:45.333 --> 25:47.834
recommendation.

25:47.875 --> 25:49.083
Dismissed.

25:50.542 --> 25:52.625
If she's right,

25:50.542 --> 25:52.625
we may not even<i> be</i>

25:52.667 --> 25:53.792
in an alternate timeline.

25:53.834 --> 25:55.875
Who knows if we're

25:53.834 --> 25:55.875
even dead or alive?

26:09.166 --> 26:12.375
Engineering.

26:12.417 --> 26:14.583
Is Engineering your

26:12.417 --> 26:14.583
destination as well?

26:16.125 --> 26:17.250
What?

26:17.291 --> 26:19.083
Oh, deck six.

26:19.125 --> 26:20.458
Sorry.

26:21.542 --> 26:24.166
(<i> lift whirring</i> )

26:24.208 --> 26:27.083
If I interpret your facial

26:24.208 --> 26:27.083
expressions correctly,

26:27.125 --> 26:30.291
you are preoccupied

26:27.125 --> 26:30.291
with something unpleasant.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.000
No, I...

26:32.041 --> 26:35.625
I was just thinking...

26:32.041 --> 26:35.625
about a lot of things.

26:37.208 --> 26:38.667
(<i> sighs</i> )

26:38.709 --> 26:41.000
I've-I've been working

26:38.709 --> 26:41.000
with one of the officers

26:41.041 --> 26:42.834
on the<i> Enterprise-C.</i>

26:42.875 --> 26:43.875
You know, he's-he's nice.

26:43.917 --> 26:45.291
I like him.

26:45.333 --> 26:47.667
I'm worried about what's

26:45.333 --> 26:47.667
going to happen to him.

26:47.709 --> 26:50.083
We may never know

26:47.709 --> 26:50.083
what happens.

26:50.125 --> 26:52.458
If they succeed,

26:50.125 --> 26:52.458
we will not even realize

26:52.500 --> 26:54.458
that these events occurred.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.417
Shields are

27:02.333 --> 27:04.417
up to 72%.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.125
That's better.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.125
Good.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.500
GARRETT:

27:08.458 --> 27:10.500
Do you believe this Guinan?

27:13.667 --> 27:16.208
I discovered long ago

27:16.250 --> 27:17.792
that she has

27:16.250 --> 27:17.792
a special wisdom.

27:17.834 --> 27:19.750
I've learned to trust it.

27:19.792 --> 27:22.000
I could arrange for you

27:19.792 --> 27:22.000
to speak with her, if you wish.

27:24.041 --> 27:26.375
Captain, I would be lying

27:24.041 --> 27:26.375
to you if I told you

27:26.417 --> 27:29.500
there was a chance in hell

27:26.417 --> 27:29.500
of coming out of this alive.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.041
Why doesn't your ship

27:30.917 --> 27:33.041
come back with us?

27:33.083 --> 27:35.417
The Romulans would be

27:33.083 --> 27:35.417
no match for your weaponry.

27:35.458 --> 27:36.959
I can't do that.

27:38.250 --> 27:39.834
No, I suppose not.

27:41.458 --> 27:42.500
You don't belong in our time

27:42.542 --> 27:45.625
any more than we belong

27:42.542 --> 27:45.625
in yours.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.375
To be honest

27:45.667 --> 27:47.375
with you, Picard...

27:47.417 --> 27:49.583
a significant number

27:47.417 --> 27:49.583
of my crew members

27:49.625 --> 27:51.083
have expressed

27:49.625 --> 27:51.083
the desire to return,

27:51.125 --> 27:52.500
even knowing the odds.

27:54.250 --> 27:57.834
Some, because they can't bear to

27:54.250 --> 27:57.834
live without their loved ones...

27:57.875 --> 27:59.291
some, because

27:57.875 --> 27:59.291
they don't like the idea

27:59.333 --> 28:01.417
of slipping out

27:59.333 --> 28:01.417
in the middle of a fight.

28:02.458 --> 28:03.875
But I have told them

28:03.917 --> 28:05.417
that, in the here and now,

28:05.458 --> 28:09.417
the Federation needs another

28:05.458 --> 28:09.417
ship against the Klingons...

28:09.458 --> 28:12.750
and we'd better get used

28:09.458 --> 28:12.750
to being in the here and now.

28:12.792 --> 28:16.625
But, if you go back, it could be

28:12.792 --> 28:16.625
a great deal more helpful.

28:16.667 --> 28:20.375
(<i> crew members</i>

28:16.667 --> 28:20.375
<i>conversing quietly</i> )

28:20.417 --> 28:22.583
The war is going very badly

28:20.417 --> 28:22.583
for the Federation.

28:22.625 --> 28:25.834
Far worse than

28:22.625 --> 28:25.834
is generally known.

28:25.875 --> 28:28.875
Starfleet Command believes

28:25.875 --> 28:28.875
that defeat is inevitable.

28:28.917 --> 28:31.083
Within six months,

28:31.125 --> 28:33.667
we may have no choice

28:31.125 --> 28:33.667
but to surrender.

28:35.250 --> 28:36.500
And you're saying

28:35.250 --> 28:36.500
that all this

28:36.542 --> 28:38.417
may be a result

28:36.542 --> 28:38.417
of our arrival here?

28:38.458 --> 28:42.250
One more ship will make no

28:38.458 --> 28:42.250
difference in the here and now,

28:42.291 --> 28:44.625
but, 22 years ago,

28:44.667 --> 28:46.709
one ship could have

28:44.667 --> 28:46.709
stopped this war

28:46.750 --> 28:48.959
before it started.

28:52.625 --> 28:54.458
Mr. Castillo.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
CASTILLO:

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
Yes, Captain.

28:56.542 --> 28:58.542
Inform the crew

28:56.542 --> 28:58.542
we're going back.

28:58.583 --> 29:00.625
Yes, Captain.

29:01.750 --> 29:05.000
The Romulans will

29:01.750 --> 29:05.000
get a good fight.

29:05.041 --> 29:07.625
We'll make it one

29:05.041 --> 29:07.625
for the history books.

29:08.959 --> 29:11.125
I know you will, Captain.

29:14.166 --> 29:16.000
Lieutenant Yar.

29:16.041 --> 29:18.375
Permission to remain

29:16.041 --> 29:18.375
a moment, sir.

29:18.417 --> 29:19.792
Granted.

29:20.917 --> 29:22.250
GARRETT:

29:20.917 --> 29:22.250
Transporter room,

29:22.291 --> 29:25.333
Captain Picard is ready

29:22.291 --> 29:25.333
to return to his ship.

29:25.375 --> 29:26.875
CREWMAN:

29:25.375 --> 29:26.875
Aye, Captain.

29:28.583 --> 29:30.500
I just wanted

29:28.583 --> 29:30.500
to say good luck.

29:33.709 --> 29:35.208
I'll try to put some

29:33.709 --> 29:35.208
of your tactical briefing

29:35.250 --> 29:37.375
to good use

29:35.250 --> 29:37.375
when we get back.

29:37.417 --> 29:39.166
Your ship has much

29:37.417 --> 29:39.166
more maneuverability

29:39.208 --> 29:41.000
than the Romulan

29:39.208 --> 29:41.000
counterparts

29:39.208 --> 29:41.000
of that era.

29:41.041 --> 29:43.417
Actually, if you

29:41.041 --> 29:43.417
could just isolate...

29:47.083 --> 29:48.875
You'll do fine.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.500
If you get back to Earth

29:54.542 --> 29:57.417
and you see a man...

29:57.458 --> 29:59.125
say, in his late 50s,

29:59.166 --> 30:02.917
taking a hard, long look

29:59.166 --> 30:02.917
across a crowded room...

30:05.500 --> 30:07.959
Hey, you never know.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.000
Good-bye, Lieutenant.

30:15.166 --> 30:16.542
(explosion)

30:15.166 --> 30:16.542
Whoa!

30:18.375 --> 30:19.959
GARRETT:

30:18.375 --> 30:19.959
Red Alert.

30:18.375 --> 30:19.959
Full power to shields.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.125
Shields are up.

30:21.166 --> 30:22.458
Functioning.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.792

30:24.834 --> 30:26.583
Ready phasers.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.041
<i>Enterprise-D,</i> has your Captain

30:28.083 --> 30:29.083
returned safely?

30:29.125 --> 30:30.208
RIKER:

30:29.125 --> 30:30.208
Acknowledged.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.667
Captain Picard is safely aboard.

30:31.709 --> 30:32.875
Fire phasers.

30:36.375 --> 30:37.667
Report.

30:37.709 --> 30:40.583

Load torpedo bays.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.709
(<i> shouts</i> )

30:53.959 --> 30:55.375
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

31:00.375 --> 31:02.750
The Klingon vessel

31:00.375 --> 31:02.750
has re-cloaked, sir.

31:02.792 --> 31:04.125
I have no readings.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.250
Captain Garrett, damage report.

31:08.875 --> 31:11.083
PICARD:

31:08.875 --> 31:11.083
Captain Garrett?!

31:11.125 --> 31:12.792
This is Lieutenant Yar, sir.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.417
Captain Garrett is dead.

31:27.417 --> 31:29.625
I'm prepared to lead

31:27.417 --> 31:29.625
the<i> Enterprise</i> back myself,

31:29.667 --> 31:30.875
Captain Picard.

31:30.917 --> 31:32.417
Sir, Lieutenant Castillo

31:32.458 --> 31:34.583
is the last surviving

31:32.458 --> 31:34.583
senior officer.

31:34.625 --> 31:37.166
He will have limited support

31:34.625 --> 31:37.166
from ops, no tactical,

31:37.208 --> 31:39.166
reduced staff

31:37.208 --> 31:39.166
in Engineering...

31:39.208 --> 31:41.875
I have good people

31:39.208 --> 31:41.875
willing to do their best.

31:41.917 --> 31:44.000
Certainly, history never

31:41.917 --> 31:44.000
meant for this ship

31:44.041 --> 31:45.709
to go into battle

31:44.041 --> 31:45.709
without her Captain.

31:45.750 --> 31:48.500
I can't speak to

31:45.750 --> 31:48.500
that point, sir,

31:48.542 --> 31:51.125
but I can get us back

31:48.542 --> 31:51.125
to where we're supposed to be.

31:51.166 --> 31:53.583
I believe that's what Captain

31:51.166 --> 31:53.583
Garrett would want me to do.

31:53.625 --> 31:55.750
DATA: Commander Data

31:53.625 --> 31:55.750
to Captain Picard.

31:55.792 --> 31:56.792
Go ahead.

31:56.834 --> 31:58.083
Sir, sensors are showing

31:58.125 --> 32:00.333
additional instability

31:58.125 --> 32:00.333
in the time rift,

32:00.375 --> 32:03.834
possibly the result

32:00.375 --> 32:03.834
of the battle with the Klingons.

32:03.875 --> 32:05.250
Any signs of other

32:03.875 --> 32:05.250
Klingon vessels?

32:05.291 --> 32:06.500
No, sir.

32:06.542 --> 32:07.875
Our coordinates

32:06.542 --> 32:07.875
have been transmitted

32:07.917 --> 32:09.500
to the Klingon

32:07.917 --> 32:09.500
Command, sir.

32:09.542 --> 32:10.834
We mustn't remain here.

32:10.875 --> 32:13.208
CASTILLO:

32:10.875 --> 32:13.208
Sir, it is my intention

32:10.875 --> 32:13.208
to return,

32:13.250 --> 32:15.041
unless you order me not to.

32:17.834 --> 32:19.375
How soon can your ship

32:17.834 --> 32:19.375
be ready?

32:19.417 --> 32:22.375
We sustained moderate damage

32:19.417 --> 32:22.375
in the attack.

32:22.417 --> 32:24.083
I think we can

32:22.417 --> 32:24.083
get underway in a few hours.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.333
Make it so.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.333
We'll give you cover.

32:31.125 --> 32:33.625
MAN:

32:31.125 --> 32:33.625
...meet him down in the docking

32:31.125 --> 32:33.625

One to beam

32:35.083 --> 32:37.083

32:39.834 --> 32:42.500
We keep saying good-bye,

32:39.834 --> 32:42.500
don't we?

32:44.417 --> 32:46.250
I wish we had more time.

32:46.291 --> 32:47.792
More time?

32:47.834 --> 32:50.834
I think we have all the time

32:47.834 --> 32:50.834
we can handle as it is.

33:14.291 --> 33:15.667
Lieutenant.

33:34.125 --> 33:36.959
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

33:37.959 --> 33:39.917
Can I get you something, Tasha?

33:42.041 --> 33:44.834
Guinan, I have

33:42.041 --> 33:44.834
to know something.

33:44.875 --> 33:47.083
What happens to me

33:44.875 --> 33:47.083
in the other timeline?

33:48.458 --> 33:51.583
I don't have alternate

33:48.458 --> 33:51.583
biographies of the crew.

33:51.625 --> 33:54.333
As I said to the Captain,

33:54.375 --> 33:57.208
it's just a feeling.

33:57.250 --> 33:59.166
But there's something more

33:57.250 --> 33:59.166
when you look at me,

33:59.208 --> 34:01.375
isn't there?

34:01.417 --> 34:04.417
I can see it in

34:01.417 --> 34:04.417
your eyes, Guinan.

34:04.458 --> 34:05.750
We've known each

34:04.458 --> 34:05.750
other too long.

34:05.792 --> 34:08.166
We weren't meant to know

34:05.792 --> 34:08.166
each other at all.

34:08.208 --> 34:11.333
At least, that's what I sense

34:08.208 --> 34:11.333
when I look at you.

34:15.667 --> 34:19.000
Tasha, you're not supposed

34:15.667 --> 34:19.000
to be here.

34:20.041 --> 34:21.542
Where am I supposed to be?

34:22.792 --> 34:23.959
Dead.

34:27.709 --> 34:29.375
Do you know how?

34:30.291 --> 34:32.166
No.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.875
But I do know

34:32.208 --> 34:34.875
it was an empty death--

34:34.917 --> 34:36.750
a death without purpose.

34:47.208 --> 34:48.709
(<i> door chime</i> )

34:48.750 --> 34:50.166
PICARD:

34:48.750 --> 34:50.166
Come.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.500
Yes, Lieutenant?

34:57.166 --> 35:01.125
Captain, I request a transfer

34:57.166 --> 35:01.125
to the<i> Enterprise-C.</i>

35:05.166 --> 35:06.542
For what reason?

35:06.583 --> 35:08.792
They need someone

35:06.583 --> 35:08.792
at tactical.

35:08.834 --> 35:11.417
We need you here.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.500

35:11.458 --> 35:13.500

35:27.709 --> 35:29.500
What did she say to you?

35:33.041 --> 35:35.166

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
I'm, I'm...

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
supposed to be dead.

35:43.959 --> 35:47.083
She felt it necessary

35:43.959 --> 35:47.083
to reveal that to you?

35:47.125 --> 35:49.417
I felt it was necessary.

35:50.375 --> 35:51.625
I see.

35:56.041 --> 35:58.250
You realize

35:56.041 --> 35:58.250
that it is very possible

35:58.291 --> 36:00.667
the<i> Enterprise-C</i> will fail.

36:00.709 --> 36:02.792
We will continue

36:00.709 --> 36:02.792
in this timeline.

36:02.834 --> 36:04.834
In which case,

36:04.875 --> 36:08.125
your life, hopefully,

36:08.166 --> 36:09.750
will continue for a long while.

36:09.792 --> 36:12.834
I know how important it is

36:09.792 --> 36:12.834
that they don't fail, Captain.

36:12.875 --> 36:15.291
That's why I'm requesting

36:12.875 --> 36:15.291
this transfer.

36:15.333 --> 36:17.500
You don't belong

36:15.333 --> 36:17.500
on that ship, Lieutenant.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.166
No, Captain Garrett

36:17.542 --> 36:20.166
belongs on that ship,

36:20.208 --> 36:21.583
but she's dead.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.291
And I think there's a certain

36:23.083 --> 36:25.291
logic in this request.

36:25.333 --> 36:27.458
There's no logic

36:25.333 --> 36:27.458
in this at all!

36:28.709 --> 36:30.917
Whether they succeed or not...

36:35.333 --> 36:37.959
...the<i> Enterprise-C</i>

36:35.333 --> 36:37.959

36:38.000 --> 36:39.208
But, Captain,

36:39.250 --> 36:41.291
at least with someone

36:39.250 --> 36:41.291
at tactical,

36:41.333 --> 36:45.208
they will have a chance

36:41.333 --> 36:45.208
to defend themselves well.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.709
It may be a matter

36:45.250 --> 36:47.709
of seconds or minutes,

36:47.750 --> 36:50.834
but those could be the minutes

36:47.750 --> 36:50.834

36:50.875 --> 36:53.667

36:55.000 --> 36:57.458

36:55.000 --> 36:57.458
of that, Captain.

37:00.375 --> 37:01.667
I've always known the risks

37:01.709 --> 37:05.083
that come

37:01.709 --> 37:05.083

37:07.458 --> 37:09.250

37:11.083 --> 37:13.709

37:11.083 --> 37:13.709
