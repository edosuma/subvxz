WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.628
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.711 --> 00:05.588
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.716
- NO!

00:07.799 --> 00:09.050
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:09.134 --> 00:10.593
- W-W-WHAT HAPPENED?

00:10.677 --> 00:11.886
- I GAINED A POUND.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.430
- [gasps]
- OH, MY GOD.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.932
- SO YOU GAINED A POUND?

00:16.015 --> 00:18.727
THERE'S MORE COMING.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.104
YOU'RE CLEVELANDERS NOW.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.814
- SHE'S RIGHT.
IT'S HAPPENING.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.233
MY BODY IS GOING NATIVE.

00:25.316 --> 00:28.111
UGH, YOU EAT DEEP-FRIED OREO
ON A DARE

00:28.194 --> 00:29.028
AND THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

00:29.112 --> 00:30.947
YOU'RE ON THAT SLIPPERY,
BUTTERY SLOPE

00:31.030 --> 00:34.451
TO AN ELASTIC WAISTBAND.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.119
- NO!

00:36.202 --> 00:37.120
I'VE GAINED A POUND TOO!

00:37.203 --> 00:39.122
- OH, GOOD.
I'M NOT ALONE.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.790
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SOUND SO HAPPY.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.751
- WELL, I'M ON AN EMOTIONAL
ROLLER COASTER.

00:42.834 --> 00:43.793
YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.463
YOU'RE PORKY LIKE ME.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.298
- UH-UH.
I'M NOT GOING NEAR THAT THING.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.175
LAST WEEK, I WENT TO
AN ITALIAN STREET FAIR

00:50.258 --> 00:52.802
AND I HAD A CANNOLI
INSIDE A ZEPPOLI

00:52.886 --> 00:54.763
INSIDE A STROMBOLI.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.307
IT WAS THEIR VERSION
OF A TURDUCKEN.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.309
- OH, PLEASE.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.478
THE AVERAGE WOMAN COULD EAT
YOUR COMBINED WEIGHT

01:01.561 --> 01:04.188
IN CHEESE FRIES.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.982
- YOU KNOW, IF WE WERE
IN LOS ANGELES,

01:06.065 --> 01:07.776
THIS WOULD BE SO EASY.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.653
ALL WE WOULD HAVE TO DO IS GO
DANCE OFF THE EXTRA POUNDS.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.989
BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT HERE
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE OUR GBFFs.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.240
- YOUR WHAT?

01:14.324 --> 01:16.034
- G-B-F-Fs.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.661
GAY BEST FRIENDS FOREVER.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.331
IN L.A., EVERY WOMAN
HAS ONE TO GO SHOPPING WITH

01:21.414 --> 01:22.624
AND DANCING WITH.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.460
- WATCH THE OSCARS
PRE-SHOW WITH.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.671
- THESE ARE
THE GAYS OF OUR LIVES.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.007
- WELL, YOU CAN STILL DANCE
WITH STRAIGHT MEN.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.133
- [scoffs]

01:32.217 --> 01:33.593
- DANCING WITH
A STRAIGHT MAN

01:33.676 --> 01:35.345
IS LIKE PUTTING
A HAT ON YOUR DOG.

01:35.428 --> 01:40.016
IT'S FUN, BUT YOU KNOW
HE HATES IT.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.227
- NOW I REALLY MISS JEFFREY.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.354
- OH, AND I MISS VLADIMIR.

01:44.437 --> 01:49.067
- I MISS DANIEL
AND RODNEY AND CHARLES.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.652
I CAN'T HOLD ON TO MY GAYS.

01:50.735 --> 01:55.073
- SHOCKER.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.866
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED
TO DO?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.701
GO OUT AND FIND
CLEVELAND GBFFs.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.371
- I WOULD LOVE TO FIND
A CLEVELAND JEFFREY.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.373
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ALL
THE LATEST FASHIONS

02:03.456 --> 02:06.042
AND THEN TELLS ME WHICH ONES
I'M TOO OLD TO PULL OFF.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.377
SOMEONE WHO CAN CALL ME "BITCH"

02:07.460 --> 02:11.881
AND MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A HUG.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.717
- LET'S DO THIS.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.052
- NO, WAIT.

02:16.135 --> 02:17.762
IS THERE EVEN A GAY PART
OF CLEVELAND?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.097
- OF COURSE.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.723
IT'S DOWN WHERE
THE AUTO SHOPS

02:20.807 --> 02:24.352
HAVE ALL BEEN TURNED
INTO CUTE CAFES.

02:24.435 --> 02:27.647
AND ONE ART GALLERY
I DO NOT RECOMMEND.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.569
- I LOVE THIS.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.362
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO OUT
WITH STRAIGHT MEN,

02:34.445 --> 02:35.238
YOU HAVE TO CREATE
THE ILLUSION

02:35.321 --> 02:37.574
THAT YOU'RE NOT WEARING
ANY MAKEUP.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.450
BUT FOR A GAY CLUB,
YOU CAN JUST SLAP IT ON

02:39.534 --> 02:41.578
WITH A TROWEL.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.580
- THEY ARE GONNA GO CRAZY
FOR US.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.000
WE ARE SO NOT GONNA
GET LAID TONIGHT.

02:54.507 --> 02:59.762
- YOU THREE LOOK RIDICULOUS.

02:59.846 --> 03:05.727

03:41.554 --> 03:44.641
{\an8}- I'M INTOXICATED ALREADY.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.267
{\an8}OH.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.478
{\an8}YOUNG, LATIN, ADORING.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.314
{\an8}COULD HE BE ANY MORE MY TYPE?

03:51.397 --> 03:52.482
{\an8}- MMM, YEAH,
DON'T FORGET,

03:52.565 --> 03:53.399
{\an8}WE'RE HERE TO FIND GBFFs,
NOT LOVERS.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.653
{\an8}- I KNOW,
BUT HE'S JUST SO ATTRACTIVE.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.864
{\an8}A PART OF ME WISHES THAT I COULD
BE A MAN FOR ONE NIGHT

03:59.948 --> 04:03.076
{\an8}AND HAVE HIM LOOK
INTO MY EYES AND WANT ME

04:03.159 --> 04:07.121
{\an8}THE WAY THAT ONLY A MAN
CAN WANT ANOTHER MAN.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.832
{\an8}- I THINK WE'RE GETTING INTO
A WEIRD AREA HERE.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.501
{\an8}- WELL, I CAN'T HELP IT.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.462
{\an8}I MEAN, LOOK AT THOSE ARMS
AND SHOULDERS.

04:14.545 --> 04:18.007
{\an8}- NICE BUNS TOO.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.175
{\an8}WHAT?

04:19.257 --> 04:21.219
{\an8}IT'S THE NAME OF THE BAR.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.889
{\an8}- OH.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.557
{\an8}- WELL, VICTORIA'S
GOT HER TARGET,

04:26.641 --> 04:29.477
{\an8}BUT WHAT ABOUT US?

04:29.560 --> 04:32.021
{\an8}- I THINK THAT LOSER
DRINKING ALONE

04:32.105 --> 04:34.023
{\an8}LOOKS LIKE YOUR TYPE.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.692
{\an8}- OH, THANK YOU, ELKA.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.985
{\an8}I MEAN, I KNOW YOU MEANT THAT
AS AN INSULT,

04:37.068 --> 04:39.362
{\an8}BUT HE'S PERFECT.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.405
{\an8}I'VE ALWAYS CHOSEN
THE POPULAR

04:40.488 --> 04:44.158
{\an8}AND CHARISMATIC GAYS
AND THEY'VE ALWAYS LEFT ME.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.703
{\an8}BUT A STRAY GAY,
I'LL BEFRIEND HIM.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.539
HE'LL BE SO GRATEFUL.
HE'LL NEVER LEAVE ME.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.417
- OKAY, YOU'VE GOT
YOUR FAWNING LATIN.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.004
YOU HAVE YOUR STRAY YOU'RE GONNA
LOCK IN A SHED OUT BACK.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.047
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYBODY HERE
FOR ME.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.048
I MEAN, THEY ALL LOOK STRAIGHT.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.133
THEY'RE ALL WEARING PLAID.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.218
AND NOT IRONIC PLAID.

05:02.301 --> 05:05.346
NOT EVEN LESBIAN PLAID.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.975
- ELKA?

05:09.058 --> 05:10.893
ELKA OSTROVSKY?

05:10.977 --> 05:14.731
- LYDIA DOMBROWSKI?

05:14.814 --> 05:18.192
- OH!

05:18.276 --> 05:20.236
- ELKA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:20.319 --> 05:23.031
- SHE HAD THAT COMING.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.038
- ELKA, WHY DID YOU HIT HER?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.414
WHO IS SHE?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.791
- LYDIA WAS MY BEST FRIEND...

05:33.875 --> 05:36.586
UNTIL THE CAMPING TRIP WHEN
SHE SLEPT WITH MY HUSBAND.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.588
- I DIDN'T DO THAT, ELKA.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.506
- AND I DIDN'T PUNCH
YOUR FACE

05:40.590 --> 05:45.720
IN ORDER TO HEAR IT
TALK MORE.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.097
- BOB AND I WERE
IN THE SLEEPING BAG

05:48.181 --> 05:50.099
BECAUSE I HAD FROSTBITE
AND HE WAS TRYING

05:50.183 --> 05:50.933
TO KEEP ME WARM.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.602
- LIAR.

05:52.685 --> 05:53.895
- IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT,

05:53.978 --> 05:55.480
THEN BELIEVE MY THREE TOES.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.773
- OH, JEEZ.
- UGH.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.775
- NO.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.235
- ONE WENT TO MARKET,
ONE STAYED HOME,

06:01.319 --> 06:04.322
ONE HAD ROAST BEEF,
AND THE LAST TWO

06:04.405 --> 06:07.450
GOT BLACK AND FELL OFF.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.495
- SO THE STORY BOB
TOLD ME...

06:10.578 --> 06:11.829
WAS TRUE.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.456
- MM-HMM.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.250
- I BURNED ALL HIS BASEBALL
CARDS FOR NOTHING.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.252
- YOU BURNED BASEBALL CARDS?

06:18.336 --> 06:19.670
- SEE?

06:19.754 --> 06:22.465
THIS IS THE LEAST-GAY
GAY BAR EVER.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.093
- OH, LYDIA, I'M SO SORRY.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.803
- OH, HONEY.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.513
- CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?
- NO.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.806
LET ME GET YOU ONE.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.015
I OWN THIS PLACE.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.975
- REALLY?
A GAY BAR?

06:33.059 --> 06:36.479
- INITIALLY, NICE BUNS
WAS A BAKERY

06:36.562 --> 06:38.606
AND THEN IT WAS A GYM
AND THEN IT WAS A GAY GYM

06:38.689 --> 06:40.691
AND NOW IT'S A GAY BAR.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.111
- MAYBE SOMEDAY IT'LL
BE A GAY BAKERY.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.446
- NO, THAT'S DOWN THE STREET.

06:45.530 --> 06:49.867
PIE-CURIOUS.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.619
- UGH.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.955
OLD PEOPLE SEX TALK,
MISSING TOES.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.498
I NEED SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
TO LOOK AT.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.166
WHERE'S MY LEANDRO?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.918
AH, THERE HE IS.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.336
- DON'T FALL IN LOVE.

07:00.419 --> 07:04.841
- EH, MIGHT BE TOO LATE.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.301
- WOULD YOU BE OKAY
IF I GO GET MY STRAY?

07:07.385 --> 07:08.511
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, SURE.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.471
I'LL JUST KEEP SCOUTING.
OOH!

07:10.555 --> 07:13.349
POSSIBLE DESIGNER JACKET
HEADED THIS WAY.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.852
HI.
ARMANI?

07:15.935 --> 07:18.479
- NO.
JOE.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.982
- NO, WHOSE JACKET
ARE YOU WEARING?

07:21.065 --> 07:23.359
- MINE.

07:23.442 --> 07:27.655
- YEAH, KEEP WALKING.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.157
- EXCUSE ME.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.075
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?
- NEVER.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.702
- SO YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING
A DATE

07:32.785 --> 07:34.495
OR A STRAIGHT GAL PAL?

07:34.579 --> 07:36.205
- NOPE, I'M COMPLETELY ALONE.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.000
- DELIGHTFUL.

07:39.083 --> 07:43.337
- I CAN'T GET OVER
HOW SMOOTH YOUR SKIN IS.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.590
- MMM, AND I YOURS.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.259
- I KNOW WE JUST MET,
BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.886
I'M VERY ATTRACTED TO YOU.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.221
- YOU ARE?
REALLY?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.681
BUT--BUT AREN'T YOU--

07:53.764 --> 07:56.225
- AH, DON'T BE COY,
VICTORIA CHASE.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.228
SO CHARMING.
SUCH PRESENCE.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.063
YOU'RE GONNA WIN FOR SURE.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.232
- EXCUSE ME?

08:03.316 --> 08:07.111
- THE CELEBRITY
DRAG QUEEN CONTEST.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.285
I JUST SAW THE OTHER CONTESTANTS
BACKSTAGE GETTING READY

08:14.368 --> 08:16.370
AND NONE OF THE MARILYN MONROES
CAN HOLD

08:16.454 --> 08:19.207
A CANDLE IN THE WIND TO YOU.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.751
- SO YOU THINK THAT I'M--

08:21.834 --> 08:27.256
- THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MAN
I EVER SEEN.

08:27.340 --> 08:32.094
BOTTOMS UP.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.806
- ALL RIGHT.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.605
- SO HE THINKS YOU'RE
A DRAG QUEEN?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.398
- WELL, AT FIRST
I WAS INSULTED,

08:44.482 --> 08:47.401
BUT THEN I REALIZED IT'S
JUST ALL THIS EXTRA MAKEUP.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.612
LOOK, I'LL ADMIT THAT
IT'S UNCONVENTIONAL,

08:49.695 --> 08:52.657
BUT WE REALLY MADE
A CONNECTION.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.116
AND HONESTLY,
IF YOU DON'T BRING UP

08:54.200 --> 08:55.451
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
NOT A MAN

08:55.534 --> 08:56.953
IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES
OF CONVERSATION,

08:57.036 --> 09:00.957
IT IS SO HARD TO SWING IT
BACK AROUND.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.792
- TO REVIEW:

09:02.875 --> 09:04.460
YOU'RE WITH A MAN WHO THINKS
YOU'RE A MAN

09:04.543 --> 09:05.920
PRETENDING TO BE A WOMAN.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.588
- YES.

09:07.672 --> 09:12.802
I AM VICTOR VICTORIA CHASE.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.428
- HONEY, I KNOW YOU DON'T
LIKE TO THINK

09:14.512 --> 09:16.472
TWO STEPS AHEAD,
BUT IN THIS CASE,

09:16.555 --> 09:19.433
JUST ONE STEP MIGHT LEAD YOU
TO QUESTION WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.643
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.937
EVERY RELATIONSHIP REQUIRES
SOME ACTING.

09:23.020 --> 09:27.233
AND IN THIS CASE,
SOME PROPS.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.904
- HOW ARE YOU EVEN
PULLING THIS OFF?

09:31.988 --> 09:33.030
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU
EXPLAINING YOUR VOICE?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.865
- I TOLD HIM IT
WAS NATURALLY HIGH

09:34.949 --> 09:37.285
BECAUSE OF MY UNUSUALLY
LONG NECK.

09:37.368 --> 09:41.622
YOU SHOULD SEE HOW GENTLY
HE TOUCHES MY ADAM'S APPLE.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.873
- YOU DON'T HAVE
AN ADAM'S APPLE.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.500
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT LEANDRO
LOVES ABOUT IT.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.544
THAT IT'S NOT THERE.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.255
- WELL, THEN HE'S REALLY GONNA
LOVE YOUR PENIS.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.344
- OKAY, I HAVE A FEW IDEAS
ABOUT THAT.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.514
- YEAH, UH, PLEASE DON'T SHARE.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.141
WHERE ARE THE OTHER
DRAG QUEENS?

10:00.224 --> 10:02.184
- OH, LEANDRO SAYS THEY'RE
BACKSTAGE PREPPING.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.352
- OH.
- OH, LOOK.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.355
HERE ARE A FEW NOW.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.316
- I DON'T KNOW IF
I SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE,

10:08.399 --> 10:10.526
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
WIN THIS CONTEST.

10:10.609 --> 10:12.236
- MATTHEW AND I WILL VOTE
FOR YOU.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.446
- MATTHEW?

10:13.529 --> 10:14.864
OH, YOUR LONELY BOY.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.365
- YES.
- OH.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.575
- HE'S PERFECT.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.493
HE'S NEVER BEEN
A GBFF BEFORE.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.204
I GET TO TRAIN HIM
TO BE EVERYTHING I WANT.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.373
IT'S THE ULTIMATE
FEMALE FANTASY.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.543
- WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
TO USE SEX AS A REWARD.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.712
- IT'S A SHAME WE LOST
SO MANY YEARS.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.214
ALL OUR FRIENDS HAD
TO PICK SIDES.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.050
- HOW'S ESTHER?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.676
- OH, FUNNY,
PRETTY ESTHER?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.677
- UH-HUH.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.555
- DEAD.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.182
YOU HEAR FROM MARTY?

10:41.265 --> 10:42.767
- MOVED TO FLORIDA.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.227
SAME AS DEAD.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.520
- CHARLES?

10:46.604 --> 10:49.231
- FOLLOWING THE DEAD.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.359
- SO THE DEAD
ARE STILL TOGETHER?

10:51.442 --> 10:54.236
- ALL EXCEPT JERRY GARCIA.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.197
DEAD.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.741
- TO THE DEAD.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.577
- SO YOU HAVE
NO OPINION WHATSOEVER

11:01.660 --> 11:02.870
ABOUT WHETHER
A WOMAN MY AGE

11:02.953 --> 11:04.080
SHOULD WEAR OVER-THE-KNEE
BOOTS?

11:04.163 --> 11:07.208
- YOU MEAN LIKE FOR FISHING?

11:07.291 --> 11:09.710
- THIS PLACE SUCKS.

11:09.794 --> 11:14.090
- SO, HOW EXACTLY DOES THIS
WHOLE GBFF THING WORK?

11:14.173 --> 11:18.677
- HAVE YOU NOT SEEN RUPERT
EVERETT IN...ANYTHING?

11:18.761 --> 11:21.389
WE GO DANCING TOGETHER,
WE GO TO CLUBS,

11:21.472 --> 11:23.808
WE GET TO BE EACH OTHER'S
PLUS ONE AT WEDDINGS--

11:23.891 --> 11:25.768
UNLESS, OF COURSE, ONE OF US
HOOKS UP WITH A GROOMSMAN.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.937
- OH, I NEVER HOOK UP.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.981
- I KNOW! WE'RE GONNA
HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.484
WE'LL GO SHOPPING,
WE'LL GOSSIP.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.403
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE WAY YOU LOOK.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.071
YOU'LL TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE WAY I LOOK.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.447
- YOU CAN MAKE ME LOOK BETTER
THAN THIS?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.283
- [laughs]

11:41.367 --> 11:44.286
OH, YOU WEREN'T JOKING.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.748
- ROME HAS ALL THE ARCHITECTURE
AND THE HISTORY.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.626
- YES, BUT LONDON HAS ALL THAT
AND THE THEATRE.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.586
- BUT IF WE'RE TALKING MOST
BEAUTIFUL,

11:52.670 --> 11:54.296
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE--

11:54.380 --> 11:57.466
both: POSITANO.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.844
- WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT
IF WE WERE ON MY BOAT RIGHT NOW,

11:59.927 --> 12:01.595
SAILING TO CAPRI?

12:01.679 --> 12:02.847
- YES.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.473
- YOU STRETCHED OUT
IN THE SUN...

12:04.557 --> 12:05.933
- YES.

12:06.016 --> 12:11.272
- IN YOUR SKIN-TIGHT SPEEDO.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.983
LEAVING NOTHING
TO THE IMAGINATION.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.987
- OH, LET'S NOT RULE OUT
IMAGINATION.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.488
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR JUST A MOMENT?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.532
I'M GONNA TO POP INTO
THE LADIES ROOM.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.451
- OH, I ADMIRE YOUR COMMITMENT
TO YOUR CHARACTER,

12:23.534 --> 12:25.828
BUT THEY WILL NEVER ALLOW A MAN
INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.

12:25.911 --> 12:26.954
I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE MEN'S ROOM.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.999
FOLLOW ME.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.709
- HE'S TAKING ME
TO THE MEN'S ROOM.

12:31.792 --> 12:32.710
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

12:32.793 --> 12:35.671
- ONE WORD: STALL.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.549
- I CAN'T STALL.
I'VE REALLY GOTTA PEE.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.347
- IS THAT A SIGNED PHOTO
OF JOHN GLENN?

12:45.431 --> 12:48.684
- OH, YEAH, HE COULD NEVER GET
ENOUGH OF THE CREAM PUFFS...

12:48.767 --> 12:53.647
WHEN THIS WAS A BAKERY.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.567
- HEY, THAT'S A PICTURE OF YOU
AND MY HUSBAND

12:56.650 --> 12:58.027
ON OUR CAMPING TRIP.

12:58.110 --> 13:03.032
I WAS IN THAT PICTURE.
HOW COME YOU CUT ME OUT?

13:03.115 --> 13:07.036
- UH, YOU WANT TO SEE
MY TOES AGAIN?

13:16.795 --> 13:18.047
- [laughs]

13:18.130 --> 13:21.717
REMEMBER, NO PEEKING.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.511
ZZZIP.

13:37.566 --> 13:38.734
- [gasps]

13:38.817 --> 13:40.402
MATTHEW!
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.071
- THANKS TO MY GBFF, JOY.

13:42.154 --> 13:45.866
- NO, YOU'RE MY GBFF.
OH, YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF IT.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.243
I THOUGHT TOMORROW NIGHT,
WE COULD GO DANCING.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.077
- LOVE IT.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.079
THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT CLUBS
DOWNTOWN

13:50.162 --> 13:51.372
OR THERE'S THIS ONE PLACE
IN THE FLATS.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.375
OR...

13:54.458 --> 13:55.751
IS THAT GUY
CHECKING ME OUT?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.378
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

13:57.461 --> 13:58.963
YOU WERE SAYING.
GREAT CLUB. US.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.131
- HE IS TOTALLY
CHECKING ME OUT.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.967
- WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD PLAY
HARD TO GET.

14:03.050 --> 14:07.596
DON'T EVEN LOOK--
AND HE'S GONE.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.056
STORY OF MY LIFE.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.810
ALWAYS A BEARD TRIMMER,
NEVER A BEARD.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.895
- OOH, HOW DID IT GO?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.230
- WELL,
IF THERE WERE AN EMMY

14:16.313 --> 14:17.648
FOR OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE
IN A MEN'S ROOM,

14:17.731 --> 14:19.984
I WOULD HAVE WON IT.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.610
- HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.070
- WELL, IF HE DID,
WOULD HE HAVE INVITED ME

14:23.153 --> 14:25.823
TO GO DANCING
AFTER THE CONTEST TONIGHT?

14:25.906 --> 14:29.994
- DANCING.
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

14:30.077 --> 14:33.789
- YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
THAT JOHN GLENN BEGGED YOU

14:33.872 --> 14:36.959
TO CUT MY PICTURE OUT SO HE
COULD LOOK AT IT IN SPACE?

14:37.042 --> 14:39.003
- YOU WERE VERY FETCHING
BACK THEN.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.297
AND UNTIL
BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT,

14:41.380 --> 14:43.966
THERE WAS NO PORN IN SPACE.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.552
LET'S GET DRUNK.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.601
- OH, HEY. THAT'S
A GREAT PICTURE, ISN'T IT?

14:53.684 --> 14:54.643
DID YOU KNOW MY DAD?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.437
- YOUR DAD?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.188
- MM-HMM.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.649
[clatter]

15:00.733 --> 15:02.026
- MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?

15:02.109 --> 15:04.111
- I'M FINE, I'M FINE.
GO GET A MOP.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.156
THE GOOD ONE FROM HOME.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.324
- I'LL JUST GET ONE
FROM THE BACK.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.534
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.202
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:12.286 --> 15:14.997
- THIS THREE-TOED LIAR
SLEPT WITH MY HUSBAND

15:15.080 --> 15:16.665
AND THEY HAD A SON!

15:16.749 --> 15:18.709
- WOW.
-OH, MY!

15:18.792 --> 15:20.336
- OH, I'M SORRY, ELKA.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.797
IT WAS JUST ONE TIME, AND WE
HATED OURSELVES FOR IT.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.301
- NOT AS MUCH AS I HATE YOU
RIGHT NOW.

15:27.384 --> 15:30.721
I CAN'T BELIEVE BOB HAD A SON
AND NEVER TOLD ME.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.140
- WELL, HE DIDN'T KNOW. AND
ELLIOT DOESN'T KNOW EITHER.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.643
AND I'M BEGGING YOU
NOT TO TELL HIM.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.394
- WHAT DOES YOUR SON KNOW?

15:37.478 --> 15:40.397
- I TOLD HIM HIS FATHER DIED
IN A LUMBERJACK ACCIDENT.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.857
- A LUMBERJACK ACCIDENT?

15:41.940 --> 15:43.651
- I WAS A SINGLE MOTHER

15:43.734 --> 15:47.154
AND I WANTED HIM TO HAVE
A STRONG MALE ROLE MODEL,

15:47.237 --> 15:51.325
AND THE BRAWNY PAPER TOWELS
WERE SITTING RIGHT THERE.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.077
- I'M GOING TO TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.703
- OH, NO,
YOU'LL CRUSH HIM.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.539
- OH, WELL, THERE'S A LOT
OF THAT GOING AROUND.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.749
- LET US TALK TO HER.

15:58.832 --> 16:01.210
- OH, THANK YOU.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.004
- ELKA, LISTEN,
I KNOW YOU'RE IN SHOCK.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.422
IT'S COMPLETELY
UNDERSTANDABLE,

16:05.506 --> 16:07.925
BUT DO YOU REALLY WANT TO
HURT SOME INNOCENT GUY

16:08.008 --> 16:09.760
JUST TO GET REVENGE
ON HIS MOTHER?

16:09.843 --> 16:13.389
- YES.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.016
- I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE
WITH REVENGE, ELKA.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.352
IT'S NEVER AS SATISFYING
AS YOU HOPE,

16:18.435 --> 16:21.730
AND THE POLICE ALWAYS COME
SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.441
- JUST THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.026
AND THAT
COMING FROM SOMEONE

16:26.110 --> 16:27.736
WHO HATES TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S SHE'S DOING.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.406
- MOM, WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU?

16:30.489 --> 16:32.241
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE
TILL I CLEAN UP THIS MESS.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.827
- NO, THIS IS MY MESS.
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.120
- NO, I WILL.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.497
THE REST OF YOU CAN GO.

16:38.580 --> 16:42.084
I SAID GO!

16:42.167 --> 16:44.753
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH MY MOTHER?

16:44.837 --> 16:50.592
- OH, WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

16:50.676 --> 16:54.096
YOU DIDN'T GET
THOSE EYES FROM HER.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.474
YOU LOOK SO MUCH
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.227
ARE YOU A LEFTY?
- YES.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.397
- ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO MUSTARD
BUT YOU CAN'T STOP EATING IT?

17:03.480 --> 17:04.982
- OH, YEAH.
I SWELL UP AT EVERY BALL GAME.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.275
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.902
- AND WHEN YOU HEAR
A MILITARY BAND,

17:08.986 --> 17:10.779
DO YOU GET
GOOSEBUMPS ALL OVER?

17:10.863 --> 17:13.281
- YES. EVERY TIME.

17:13.365 --> 17:18.119
- YOUR FATHER
WOULD'VE LIKED THAT.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.288
- WAIT,
SHE'S TOUCHING HIM.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.455
IS THAT A GOOD THING
OR A BAD THING?

17:20.539 --> 17:23.834
- STOP TALKING OR I'LL NEVER BE
ABLE TO READ THEIR LIPS.

17:23.916 --> 17:28.088
THE CUMULUS TOOTHPASTE
IS PLEXI-GLASS.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.798
- YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT THAT.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.467
- THANK YOU.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.803
- WOW, THAT, UH, THAT
WAS SOME CAMPING TRIP

17:34.887 --> 17:36.305
YOU GUYS WENT ON.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.265
- YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT
THE CAMPING TRIP?

17:38.348 --> 17:42.019
- JUST HOW GREAT IT WAS TO
HAVE A LUMBERJACK WITH US.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.479
- THANK YOU, ELKA.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.772
- IT SOUNDS LIKE DAD
WAS QUITE THE CATCH.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.315
IT'S A GOOD THING ELKA

17:46.398 --> 17:48.442
WAS DATING JOHN GLENN
AT THE TIME.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.153
- ELKA DATED JOHN GLENN.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.323
- WOULD YOU STOP?
YOU'RE THE WORST AT THIS.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.825
- VICTORIA, THE CONTEST
IS ABOUT TO START

17:56.909 --> 17:59.286
IN CASE YOU NEED TO DO
ANY LAST MINUTE SHAVING.

17:59.369 --> 18:02.331
- OH, NO NEED.
ELECTROLYSIS.

18:02.414 --> 18:06.126
- OUCH. YOU ARE A STRONG MAN,
VICTORIA CHASE.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.128
- I'LL SEE YOU
IN A MINUTE.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.880
ISN'T HE FABULOUS?

18:09.963 --> 18:13.842
AND HE'S SO ATTENTIVE
TO MY THEORETICAL NEEDS.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.677
- DID YOU TELL HIM?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.012
- NO.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.722
- ARE YOU OKAY?

18:18.806 --> 18:21.558
- I'M IN SHOCK
AND IT HURTS.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.186
I COULD USE SOMETHING
TO GET MY MIND OFF IT.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.439
- WELL, VICTORIA'S
ABOUT TO COMPETE

18:27.523 --> 18:30.025
IN A CELEBRITY DRAG QUEEN
CONTEST AS A MAN

18:30.108 --> 18:32.903
IN ORDER TO IMPRESS A GAY MAN
SHE'S FALLEN IN LOVE WITH

18:32.986 --> 18:34.363
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
SHE'S NOT A MAN.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.657
- THAT'LL WORK.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.036
- LET'S FIND OUT
OUR LUCKY WINNER.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.704
ARE YOU READY?
ARE YOU READY?

18:42.788 --> 18:44.581
ALL RIGHT.

18:44.665 --> 18:48.043
SECOND RUNNER UP IS
LIZA MINNELLI.

18:48.126 --> 18:48.836
[cheers and applause]

18:48.919 --> 18:50.796
YOU DID IT.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.548
GREAT JOB, LIZA.

18:52.631 --> 18:53.715
ALL RIGHT, STEP BACK.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.717
THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL
BEEN WAITING FOR.

18:55.801 --> 19:00.848
THE WINNER OF THIS YEAR'S

19:02.474 --> 19:04.768
YES!

19:04.852 --> 19:08.480
- NOOOOOO!

19:13.151 --> 19:14.194
- IT WAS SWEET OF YOU GUYS
TO GET THESE PIES FOR ME.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.904
BUT WHAT ABOUT
YOUR EXTRA POUND?

19:15.988 --> 19:21.076
- MMM, THERE ARE NO CALORIES
IF YOU'RE CONSOLING A FRIEND.

19:21.159 --> 19:23.078
SO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE EVER
GOING TO SEE ELLIOT AGAIN?

19:23.161 --> 19:26.415
- I'D LIKE TO. EVENTUALLY.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.751
IT WAS NICE LOOKING INTO
MY HUSBAND'S EYES AGAIN.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.920
[text chime]

19:32.004 --> 19:34.298
- OH, IT'S LEANDRO...

19:34.381 --> 19:37.926
APOLOGIZING FOR LEAVING ME
FOR SUSAN LUCCI.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.469
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.930
I MEAN, WHAT DOES SHE HAVE
THAT I DON'T HAVE?

19:42.014 --> 19:45.976
OH, YEAH. THAT.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.436
- SHOULD WE TRY
THE LEMON MERINGUE?

19:47.519 --> 19:50.939
- NO. THE GUYS AT PIE-CURIOUS
WERE RIGHT.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.067
ONCE YOU GO BLACKBERRY...

20:03.201 --> 20:05.078
- WELL, I KNOW THESE CALORIES
DON'T COUNT,

20:05.162 --> 20:09.124
BUT I JUST NEED TO KNOW.

20:09.207 --> 20:11.293
AAH! I LOST A POUND.

20:11.376 --> 20:16.006
- I TURNED THE SCALE BACK.

20:16.089 --> 20:19.551
IN CLEVELAND,
WE CALL THAT A DIET.
