WEBVTT

01:24.418 --> 01:25.486
Mr. Russell?

01:27.054 --> 01:28.456
You know the routine.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.524
Place your hands
on the wall for me.

01:31.659 --> 01:32.960
See you, eh...

01:32.960 --> 01:34.995
And when you're done,
let's talk.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.372
In accordance
to Texas State Department

01:44.372 --> 01:46.674
of Corrections
maximum status release,

01:46.674 --> 01:50.411
you've met the three month
mandatory contact standard.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.980
It's my determination
that you are in compliance

01:52.980 --> 01:54.982
with the conditions
of your parole.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.984
You've found employment,

01:56.984 --> 01:58.819
passed all mandatory
drug screenings

01:58.819 --> 02:02.590
and are attending the required
group therapy sessions

02:02.590 --> 02:04.392
for violent offenders.

02:04.392 --> 02:08.729
This is all noted
in your personal file.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.398
Mr. Russell,

02:10.398 --> 02:12.766
how would you say things
have been for you

02:12.766 --> 02:15.068
since your return to society?

03:47.295 --> 03:48.929
I know what to fucking do.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.781
<i>We're about finished here.</i>

04:07.781 --> 04:09.016
<i>Clear the exit.</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:13.987
All clear.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.227
It's time.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.389
We're on, baby.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.497
Don't move!
Drop the fucking bags!

04:56.497 --> 04:58.566
- Drop the bag!

04:58.566 --> 04:59.567
30 seconds!

04:59.567 --> 05:01.502
Turn around! Hands on your head!

05:01.502 --> 05:03.036
- Move!

05:07.541 --> 05:09.276
Get on your fucking knees!

05:10.378 --> 05:11.679
- Set!
Moving!

05:11.679 --> 05:13.213
Cover!

05:17.718 --> 05:18.686
All set!

05:18.686 --> 05:19.753
Moving!

05:22.623 --> 05:23.591
All set!

05:23.591 --> 05:25.225
I'm moving.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.429
No!

05:35.335 --> 05:36.904
Come on!
Let's get the fuck out of here!

05:36.904 --> 05:38.772
Let's go, let's go!
Come on!

05:41.742 --> 05:43.310
What did the fuck did you do?

05:43.310 --> 05:44.778
Hey, hey, hey!
Fuck!

05:44.778 --> 05:46.414
Heads up! Heads up!

05:50.684 --> 05:52.285
Ah, shit!

05:55.088 --> 05:57.190
What the fuck is wrong with you?

05:59.593 --> 06:00.628
Just drive.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.506
Hey, babe. What's up?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.810
What? Define knife?

06:20.280 --> 06:21.582
All right. Well, yeah,

06:21.582 --> 06:24.084
I can't talk
about this right now.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.586
Well, right now is work.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.655
Okay. We'll talk about it
when I get home.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.557
It's okay. We'll figure it out.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.594
All right. Well,
tell baby girl I love her.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.662
I love you, too.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.265
Fly in the ointment?

06:38.265 --> 06:40.934
Matthew, took a knife to school.

06:40.934 --> 06:41.935
A knife?

06:41.935 --> 06:43.036
Is he 14?

06:43.036 --> 06:44.371
He's 15.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.873
Are they expelling him?

06:45.873 --> 06:47.975
Well, I don't know.
Sure hope not.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.443
Private school ain't cheap.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.479
Well, education isn't cheap.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.113
I'm still paying off
college loans.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.482
Huh. Yeah, maybe
you could borrow some money

06:54.482 --> 06:56.416
- from this crew.
No shit.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.719
Evidence response team?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.454
Ah, no. Actually,
we're just looking for a place

07:00.454 --> 07:02.189
- to get some lunch.
- Yeah.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.224
I'm Special Agent
Brett Solomon. FBI.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.292
Good to meet you.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.794
Special Agent Angela Jordan.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.562
- Pleasure.
- Major Crimes Division.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.997
We appreciate the assist.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.965
Dan Pogue. Sheriff.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.668
So this is what the FBI
looks like now, huh?

07:14.668 --> 07:16.804
Times are changing fast
over there.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.873
Well, not fast enough
if you ask me.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.743
So, what's the M.O.?

07:22.743 --> 07:26.213
Well, we had three gunmen
wearing masks.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.681
Carrying ARs.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.482
Couple of Glocks.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.317
Lord knows what all.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.985
You wanna walk us through?

07:31.985 --> 07:34.522
Well, the, uh, the guard,

07:34.522 --> 07:37.491
he came out of the bank
carrying the money bags.

07:37.491 --> 07:41.328
The gunmen ambushed him
from a SUV.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.631
One of the gunmen shot
the guard.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.667
Driver witness it?

07:46.667 --> 07:49.002
Whole deal. Everything.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.170
And where is he?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.105
She. Indoors.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.373
Let's go.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.914
That's the roundup, eh?

08:33.914 --> 08:34.982
Yeah.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.719
Well, little brother,
you got, uh,

08:38.719 --> 08:40.320
270 grand.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.824
So, get him clean cash
from the back.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.929
Just a quick question.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.532
What the fuck happened
out there?

08:54.534 --> 08:55.936
It's on me.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.270
No doubt about that.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.471
When the Feds are up
my fucking ass,

08:58.471 --> 09:00.273
that's on you too.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.942
We all knew there was a risk.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.179
Look, I could give two shits if
you whacked a fucking pig, okay?

09:06.179 --> 09:09.516
I'm talking about
the cowboy shit, all right?

09:09.516 --> 09:12.620
And if that shit,
comes back on me,

09:13.787 --> 09:16.089
there's gonna be
fucking hell to pay.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.324
What are you saying?

09:17.324 --> 09:18.626
It simply means that

09:18.626 --> 09:21.094
if you back me
in a fucking corner,

09:21.094 --> 09:23.530
and you leave me one option.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.433
Okay, different tact.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.602
Give me a word that's not
coming back on me.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.604
16 years inside, motherfucker.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.872
That's my word.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.142
You're just
temperamental as your old man.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.343
How is Ruben?

09:36.343 --> 09:38.145
A fucking prick.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.713
You should go see him.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.082
Okay.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.552
So I'm gonna go with God
and your word is good.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.420
What about the, uh...

09:48.321 --> 09:49.957
What about Superboy?

09:49.957 --> 09:51.959
Superboy?
What are you talking about?

09:51.959 --> 09:53.460
Your brother.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.527
What about him?

09:54.527 --> 09:55.863
You vouch for him?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.331
He's my brother.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.670
That gives me so much solace.

10:07.875 --> 10:08.909
You want a drink?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.316
Give me a minute.
'Cause I just-- I found

10:16.316 --> 10:18.686
something that I thought
you might be interested in.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.989
It's a bank job.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.523
Weekly cash delivery.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.058
Uh, armored car.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.260
Here's the thing.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.530
It is mid to high.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.865
Six figures.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.667
And my inside guy, Devland.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.769
He's the bank manager.
He just wants to meet you.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.037
When?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.505
Next week.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.107
You interested?

10:41.374 --> 10:42.509
We sit down.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.712
Talk about the particulars.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.646
Yeah?

10:47.447 --> 10:49.549
- Yeah, I'm in.
Good.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.884
Before I forget,

10:51.885 --> 10:53.586
it's good to have you back.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.268
<i>All right, what can you, uh--</i>

11:08.268 --> 11:09.269
can you tell us about 'em?

11:09.269 --> 11:10.771
Um, what?

11:10.771 --> 11:12.239
What do you wanna know?

11:12.239 --> 11:15.075
Well, how did they come in?

11:15.075 --> 11:16.810
I mean, were they fast?

11:16.810 --> 11:19.446
Did they-- did they seem like
professionals?

11:19.446 --> 11:21.648
They-- they moved like a--

11:21.648 --> 11:22.916
a SWAT team.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.052
Okay. Sounds tactical.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.286
Maybe military.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.387
Mm-hmm.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.489
Anything stand out?

11:29.489 --> 11:31.925
Any tattoos
or distinguishing marks?

11:31.925 --> 11:34.795
I mean, one. One spoke Spanish.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.329
Well, that narrows it down
to about

11:36.329 --> 11:38.065
one third of the population.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.935
The one-- the one that, um,
held his-- his gun to me.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.238
Uh, he-- it--

11:45.238 --> 11:46.406
He was the leader.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.076
He just had this, this look.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.177
What--

11:50.177 --> 11:51.411
How could you tell
he was the leader?

11:51.411 --> 11:53.246
Oh, you-- you could just--

11:53.246 --> 11:54.414
just tell.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.283
Fair enough.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.685
Anything else you can remember?

11:58.685 --> 12:01.254
One of the others, um,

12:01.254 --> 12:02.489
shot-- shot Philip.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.591
Local PD found the drop car.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.426
Okay.
Just give us a minute, okay?

12:06.426 --> 12:07.795
Be right back.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.801
Make it quick.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.306
Let me guess. Extra crispy?

12:19.306 --> 12:22.042
You got it.
A good Samaritan phoned it in,

12:22.042 --> 12:24.177
<i>thought some honkies
blew a meth lab.</i>

12:24.177 --> 12:26.980
<i>- We're running the plates now.</i>
<i>Much likely stolen.</i>

12:26.980 --> 12:28.515
<i>Where'd they find the car?</i>

12:28.515 --> 12:30.383
Sending smoke signals
a county over.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.285
It's probably a waste of time
against my better judgment.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.122
<i>But let's check the car
for prints, DNA, hair,</i>

12:35.122 --> 12:37.157
anything that can lead us
back these guys.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.792
Then let's check the vin

12:38.792 --> 12:40.627
<i>against any previous owners
and title.</i>

12:40.627 --> 12:42.195
- You got it.
- Okay.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.131
One of my team will get back
in touch with you.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.950
We're very sorry for
what happened to your partner.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.085
Thank you.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.087
Look at me.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.024
I'm gonna get 'em.

13:59.739 --> 14:00.974
Where is he?

14:03.977 --> 14:05.545
What the fuck took you so long?

14:05.545 --> 14:07.214
Did you go see Daddy?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.715
No.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.083
Don't smoke in here.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.586
That's for you.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.854
Gracias.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.591
Hey. Where's mine?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.461
Checked the last one?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.096
I motherfucking checked.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.399
Frisk the guard!

14:26.399 --> 14:27.467
That was your one job!

14:27.467 --> 14:29.236
I did, motherfucker!

14:29.236 --> 14:30.904
How am I supposed to know
he had a fucking ankle piece?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.305
We don't shoot people.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.774
When someone pulls
a fucking gun,

14:34.774 --> 14:36.576
you be prepared
for when it goes off!

14:36.576 --> 14:38.178
Spare me your military bullshit.
It doesn't even impress me,

14:38.178 --> 14:39.746
- motherfucker.
- That's fucking bullshit.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.348
Fucking true,

14:41.348 --> 14:43.316
a rule I fucking live by!

14:43.316 --> 14:46.119
There's one rule.
We don't get caught.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.988
I didn't see
the gun either, Gabe.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.122
I didn't.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.962
Fuck out of my face.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.099
I fucked up. There you go.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.968
That what you wanted to hear.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.870
Hm?

15:05.138 --> 15:07.274
What about that fucking
bullshit out there?

15:07.274 --> 15:09.142
Do you think that's not
gonna get us jailed up?

15:09.142 --> 15:11.378
- That's my fucking car.
Gabe is right, man.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.114
You know the Shop
doesn't pay big wages.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.949
We gotta make this look good, baby.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.317
Yeah, whatever.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.152
You better hold on
to your share.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.121
Until it cools down
or until you grow the fuck up.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.889
Hold on. Come-- come again.

15:24.857 --> 15:25.892
My fucking daddy now?

15:25.892 --> 15:27.194
Paying me an allowance?

15:27.194 --> 15:28.261
It's my money!

15:29.029 --> 15:31.498
What happened to the 85
from the Southlake job?

15:32.699 --> 15:35.668
What happened to the 70
from the Flower Mound truck?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.571
Casino or strip club, motherfucker?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.673
Just shut the fuck up already.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.842
Fuck off my back.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.748
Did, uh, Rader mention
he had any more work?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.150
I don't need Rader for jobs.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.685
I want you to stay away
from him.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.754
Why? I didn't do time for him.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.023
I did.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.658
Stay out of his bar.

15:58.658 --> 15:59.892
That clear?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.399
You know, uh,

16:06.399 --> 16:09.269
I deserve to be part
of the brotherhood too, right?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.938
Stay out of his bar.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.542
I'm serious.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.078
- Fuck you!

16:23.050 --> 16:25.352
You were just like him once.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.419
Just like that.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.455
Adios.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.838
Armored car driver was right.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.140
Mm-hmm.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.676
It appears they've taken
a class or two.

17:58.845 --> 17:59.946
Need to take it?

17:59.946 --> 18:01.114
Ah.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.049
No. I'll call her back.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.119
She's just trying to plan
Chloe's birthday party,

18:06.119 --> 18:09.055
trying to figure out
what we're gonna do with my son.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.858
- Did you talk to him?

18:11.858 --> 18:15.495
No. When was the last time
you talked to a teenager?

18:15.495 --> 18:18.398
Think I'd have more luck
breaking into a bank vault.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.170
Hey whoa, whoa.
Pause that for a second.

18:27.674 --> 18:28.908
You see that?

18:32.044 --> 18:33.880
Someone has a conscience.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.195
Order up.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.839
Here you go.
Do you need anything else?

18:59.839 --> 19:02.709
Okay, thank you.
- Okay. Just let me know.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.976
Hey.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.547
- Talk to me.
- Let go of me.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.217
Look at me.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.387
I'll tell you
when it's time to let go.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.592
Okay.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.064
Let's go.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.043
Why do you keep coming
over here for?

19:37.043 --> 19:38.878
I just wanted to see you.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.313
What do you want?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.983
Could you take a break?
Maybe sit down.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.652
Some coffee or something.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.456
What happened?

19:49.456 --> 19:50.523
He do that?

19:53.326 --> 19:55.127
Don't act like you care.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.364
Still your dad.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.333
You don't deserve that.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.769
You know, how about I tell you

20:02.769 --> 20:03.836
what I deserve?

20:04.771 --> 20:08.241
It's better than you
and it's better than this.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.544
But it's all I've ever had.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.315
Eventually, you just get
fucking used to it.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.620
You remind me of your mom.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.091
She died a long time ago.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.659
Just like you did.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.662
Order something or leave.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.199
I know I haven't been there,
but I'm trying to change--

20:33.199 --> 20:36.135
Order something
or fucking leave.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.172
I'll take some coffee.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.349
I don't wanna see you again.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.004
Here we got our Spanish speaker.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.373
Trigger man.

21:14.841 --> 21:15.875
Crew leader.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.311
Mm-hmm. I like it.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.513
Crime lab came back
on the robbery SUV.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.316
It's clean. No prints.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.485
- No DNA.
Yeah, you were right.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.720
- Plates were decoys.
- And the wheel goes round.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.157
But we were able to trace
the vin number of the SUV

21:31.157 --> 21:32.725
back to an owner out of Dallas

21:32.725 --> 21:34.827
who reported it stolen
two days ago.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.829
Okay.
Well, let's subpoena the owner.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.531
Bring him in for questioning.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.166
See if they have any priors.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.534
Anything that'll link 'em
to the other robberies.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.670
And, uh,
let's check with local C.I.'s.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.705
See if there's anything
on the ground. Okay.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.707
Thank you, Roberts.

21:47.707 --> 21:48.775
Good job.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.186
Agent Solomon.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.921
The man, the myth, the legend.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.457
Oh, you're the only legend
left here in this bureau, Dick.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.225
I was referring to your father.

22:06.225 --> 22:08.194
But that is a nice tie
you got there.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.396
Thank you. Yeah.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.397
Daughter picked it out.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.598
She has good taste.

22:11.598 --> 22:12.699
Yeah.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.534
Why are you referring
to him for?

22:14.534 --> 22:16.869
You know, seeing you in your
father's shoes right now.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.405
He'd have been proud.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.908
Yeah, some bitter lessons
were learned at Waco.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.476
And, uh,

22:23.476 --> 22:25.144
he shouldn't have punished
himself for other people's sins.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.246
Yeah.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.718
$2 for a bottle of water.

22:31.718 --> 22:32.885
You believe that?

22:32.885 --> 22:34.220
Highway robbery if you ask me.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.555
So, did you really come

22:35.555 --> 22:37.289
all the way down here
to be nostalgic?

22:37.289 --> 22:38.558
You know, Intelligence Division

22:38.558 --> 22:40.427
- keeps me busy enough.
- Hmm.

22:40.427 --> 22:43.062
Takes a lot of work keeping
things hush, hush, you know.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.231
Silence is the language of God.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.733
Indeed.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.301
So, ah, why don't we
just cut the shit

22:49.301 --> 22:50.737
and you tell me really
why you're down here.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.772
I heard you took on
a robbery crew.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.807
And there's a lot
of publicity in it.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.609
Just wanted to know
if you have any leads?

22:56.609 --> 22:57.944
Yeah.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.447
Yeah, I mean, we're--
we're close actually.

23:00.447 --> 23:01.981
Yeah, uh-huh, well.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.416
Good to hear.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.617
Let me know if I can do
anything to help at all.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.419
- Anything.
All right.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.120
You know, and obviously, Dick,
if--if Intelligence

23:08.120 --> 23:09.355
has any information on the case

23:09.355 --> 23:10.857
that would be beneficial,
you'll--

23:10.857 --> 23:12.759
you'll be sure to let me know
as well, right?

23:12.759 --> 23:14.527
If I hear anything at all,
I'll be sure to let you know.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.829
But can I offer some advice?

23:17.830 --> 23:19.932
Some, uh, advice
your father didn't take.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.834
Yeah.
And what advice would that be?

23:21.834 --> 23:23.870
It's okay
if you don't win this one.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.608
Well, that is terrible advice.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.110
I can understand why
he didn't listen.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.411
The day ain't over yet.

23:44.356 --> 23:45.592
Typically,

23:46.358 --> 23:49.796
you don't catch Texans
trading in their spurs for skis.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.800
Look.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.735
I just want you to know
that I appreciate

23:55.735 --> 23:58.304
what you did for my cousin
while you were on the inside.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.573
And as we discussed before,

24:01.841 --> 24:03.810
all you need is 5 percent
earnest money

24:03.810 --> 24:05.311
to show commitment.

24:05.311 --> 24:06.746
You got the money?

24:22.194 --> 24:25.397
Well, I'd say

24:25.397 --> 24:27.567
that's a whole lot more
than 5 percent.

24:28.901 --> 24:29.936
How much is it?

24:32.104 --> 24:33.806
It's 250,000 dollars.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.275
I'd ask where it came from.

24:36.275 --> 24:39.245
But asking is for lawyers.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.914
And as long as I get
my percentage,

24:41.914 --> 24:43.349
we got a deal.

24:43.349 --> 24:47.053
There will be a $60,000
remaining balance.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.221
I just need you to sign below.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.425
Next to the X, pal.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.395
Good.

24:56.395 --> 24:58.531
I will draft a cashier's check.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.533
I'll overnight it to ensure
they receive

25:00.533 --> 25:02.034
this in a timely manner.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.036
This check's gotta be received
within five days

25:04.036 --> 25:06.472
of the binding agreement date.

25:06.472 --> 25:09.375
It is a competitive market
out there.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.243
You don't wanna waste a moment.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.913
You're all set.

25:16.415 --> 25:18.685
Pleasure doing business
with you.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.805
What do you want?

26:19.011 --> 26:20.680
The boy's lost to me.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.116
- Did you know he took him?
I did.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.584
I know what you did, too.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.788
What do you know about me?

26:28.788 --> 26:30.923
It's all over the morning news.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.794
Yeah, that went south.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.129
You should cut ties. Walk away.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.530
That's what you did.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.300
I'm not talking about me!

26:43.035 --> 26:45.905
Yeah, you never did much
talking back then.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.377
The past ain't never where
you think you left it, boy.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.714
I've accepted what I've done.
Have you?

27:03.355 --> 27:04.724
You should talk to a doctor.

27:06.558 --> 27:09.361
Ain't no doctor could cure me.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.931
I'm an old man. Old men die.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.167
You're a reformed man.

27:16.402 --> 27:17.837
Reformed.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.343
That what you call yourself?

27:24.343 --> 27:26.578
Doing what you think is right

27:26.578 --> 27:29.048
ain't the same as doing
what's right.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.251
Yeah, there's never been
anything right

27:32.251 --> 27:33.552
about this family.

27:33.552 --> 27:36.588
I guess being a criminal
runs in ours.

27:37.724 --> 27:40.927
You know, it's a good thing
your mother ain't around

27:40.927 --> 27:42.929
to see how we all turned out.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.399
You got a choice, boy.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.069
Look where mine led.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.074
Rader won't stop.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.744
What makes you think I won't?

27:59.511 --> 28:01.613
You're like me, he knows it.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.482
You don't know me at all.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.619
You can't trust him.

28:26.773 --> 28:27.807
What's up, Brandy?

28:27.807 --> 28:29.241
Hey, baby, how are ya?

28:29.241 --> 28:30.442
I'm good. You doing okay?

28:30.442 --> 28:31.778
I'm doing awesome.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.780
Good. You know where Mandy's at?

28:33.780 --> 28:35.514
Right upstairs waiting on you.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.585
- Hey, man.
- Doing good, my bro?

28:39.585 --> 28:41.287
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.956
Take care of yourself,
all right.

28:53.665 --> 28:57.269
<i>♪ Hey, you say</i>

28:57.269 --> 29:00.272
<i>♪ Hey, you say it</i>

29:30.269 --> 29:31.503
Fuck off.

29:33.705 --> 29:37.844
<i>♪ Because I will be high
all the time ♪</i>

29:40.880 --> 29:44.250

29:44.250 --> 29:48.654
<i>♪ Hey, stay...</i>

29:48.654 --> 29:53.025

all the time ♪</i>

29:53.025 --> 29:54.093
Hey.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.328
I'm the last one.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.629
Where you been?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.332
Doing man shit.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.901
Hmm.

30:01.901 --> 30:02.935
Man shit.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.036
Hmm.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.538
You know me.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.580
How you been?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.182
Better now that you're here.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.716
All right.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.708
Bring me the light and a drill.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.651
Can I get a new one
when this is over?

31:26.618 --> 31:28.254
No.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.023
Smart folks
keep the old ones running.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.324
Hey.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.994
Do you care
if I score some early cash?

31:34.994 --> 31:36.328
- Yeah, I do.
- Before I leave.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.664
Yeah, I do.
Uh, I actually, I mind.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.132
If you're not gonna do
the fucking job,

31:40.132 --> 31:42.134
you're not getting paid,
all right?

31:42.969 --> 31:44.436
What the--Come on, dude.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.205
I already stocked
the shelves and shit.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.607
Uh, I got everything
done already.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.442
- Come on.
- And now?

31:50.442 --> 31:51.877
I need you to sweep the floor.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.712
You fucking kidding me?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.015
No, I'm not.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.784
Do I look like
some little grunt bitch?

31:58.784 --> 32:00.152
Make one of the--

32:00.152 --> 32:01.553
One of those little
chicken shits do it.

32:01.553 --> 32:02.688
- Come on, man.
- Remember kid,

32:02.688 --> 32:04.456
I didn't fucking want you here.

32:04.456 --> 32:05.992
Your brother did.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.460
You know what? Fuck you, Dallas!

32:08.460 --> 32:10.162
Get control
of your brother, Gabe.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.364
Bitch-ass motherfucker!

32:19.671 --> 32:21.807
Start you piece of shit.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.675
Engine is shot, man.

32:24.510 --> 32:25.777
Yeah.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.716
I'll take you home.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.024
There's the love of my life.

32:40.559 --> 32:41.660
Gracias.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.129
No problem, brother.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.497
What happened
to your truck my love?

32:45.497 --> 32:48.167
It didn't want to start.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.335
In the shop.

32:49.335 --> 32:50.669
Gabe gave me a ride.

32:50.669 --> 32:53.072
Why don't you
invite him for dinner?

32:53.905 --> 32:55.241
Hey, Gabe!

33:02.181 --> 33:03.282
Gracias.

33:03.282 --> 33:04.716
No.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.857
Mija. Get this plate.

33:11.857 --> 33:14.593
Are you finished
with your plate?

33:14.593 --> 33:16.328
Thank you.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.999
Does he look like his father?

33:25.471 --> 33:27.373
He does.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.975
Yeah, he does.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.717
I plan to teach my son
how to fish.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.752
Just like my father taught me.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.624
Did you do much fishing?

33:45.624 --> 33:47.459
Cerveza just for you.

33:47.459 --> 33:48.894
Thank you.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.198
Long time ago, I did.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.834
When I uh...

33:58.970 --> 34:01.073
My mom used to leave my old man.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.509
Every couple of years,
she'd always come back.

34:03.509 --> 34:07.113
One year, she took, uh,
me and Wes up north.

34:08.114 --> 34:11.417
She came from--
her brother had a boat.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.952
Wes and I spent
the whole summer on the lake.

34:14.986 --> 34:16.955
It's the best memory of my life.

34:16.955 --> 34:18.624
You should go back someday.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.927
[IN SPANISH] My love,
I'm putting the baby to bed.

34:21.927 --> 34:23.395
Okay.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.133
Good night, my love.

34:30.169 --> 34:31.603
Thanks for dinner.

34:31.603 --> 34:32.971
You're welcome.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.840
How the fuck did you score that?

34:34.840 --> 34:37.843
- I know you, motherfucker.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.112
See man, uh,

34:40.112 --> 34:42.614
when you got locked up,

34:42.614 --> 34:43.982
I went back to Mexico,

34:43.982 --> 34:45.684
lay low for a little bit.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.119
But when I met Camilla,

34:47.119 --> 34:48.654
I knew that she was the one.

34:48.654 --> 34:49.988
Hm-mm.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.391
She got pregnant with my son.

34:52.391 --> 34:55.060
We decided to come back
to America.

34:55.060 --> 34:57.196
Wanted to give him the best,
you know.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.800
Anyways, man, how is Dawn?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.502
She oughta be in her 20s by now.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.872
She hates me.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.210
I earned it.

35:12.077 --> 35:13.679
It was pretty fucked up.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.515
I wasn't there for her
when her mom died.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.686
I don't think she ever really
had a chance.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.120
You know what I mean?

35:24.923 --> 35:27.125
Is there a way
to turn that around?

35:29.595 --> 35:31.062
None that she'd like.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.736
I shouldn't have never brought
you back into this shit.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.405
No, man.

35:39.405 --> 35:42.408
You know, Camilla wants to bring
her family out from Mexico.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.478
She wants them to be involved
in the children's life.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.782
But it costs money
to bring them over.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.651
And even more to keep 'em here.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.954
And this job
and the shitty wages,

35:56.888 --> 35:58.524
you know that ain't enough.

35:58.524 --> 35:59.958
And being illegal.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.193
- Yeah.
I--

36:01.193 --> 36:04.796
I mean, need some help.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.199
I really need this money.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.268
It's one last job.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.136
It's gotta be smooth.

36:11.136 --> 36:12.571
We can't fuck it up.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.242
I guess, we play the game
till we don't.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.313
This one we can't lose.

36:24.149 --> 36:26.452
Money's how we keep score, baby.

36:29.855 --> 36:34.059
<i>This is KOTW Channel 5's,

- Okay?
- Hm.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.963
Just go get us some beer.

37:16.001 --> 37:19.037
You mind not eye-fucking

Give me a bottle, would you?

37:46.164 --> 37:48.066
I said a fucking bottle.

37:56.342 --> 37:58.610
Wrong place, wrong time.

38:01.547 --> 38:04.916
Wonder if these guys know just
how much shit they're in.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.552
Capital murder.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.719
They're about to.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.187
Oh, let's go.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.989

<i>Phillip Davis' death?</i>

38:12.391 --> 38:14.092

38:14.092 --> 38:15.827
- Do you care to comment?

38:15.827 --> 38:17.262
Thank you.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.042
Mandy.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.211
- Like--
- Like candy.

38:33.211 --> 38:35.013
Are you asleep, Mandy?

38:35.013 --> 38:36.682
I can be.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.249
Hmm.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.718
What the fuck?

38:39.718 --> 38:41.353
Hey, calmate.
Fuck you, dude.

38:41.353 --> 38:42.754
- Take it easy on me.
- Get your fucking hand

38:42.754 --> 38:44.390
- out of my face.
Calmate, amigo,

38:44.390 --> 38:45.957
why don't you just get us
another round of beer?

38:45.957 --> 38:47.225
Who even knows what the fuck
you're talking about?

38:47.225 --> 38:48.760
Well, I'm speaking English,

38:48.760 --> 38:50.228
- so you'd better understand.
Fuck you all.

38:50.228 --> 38:51.397
Do I look like your bitch
or something?

38:51.397 --> 38:52.764
Who the fuck are y'all?

38:52.764 --> 38:55.033
What the fuck is that
you're compensating for?

38:55.033 --> 38:56.267
Hey.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.370
Hey!

38:58.370 --> 38:59.871
That's my girl.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.040
- Well, she's everybody's girl.
- What'd you say?

39:02.040 --> 39:03.775
I said she's everybody's
fucking girl.

39:03.775 --> 39:04.976
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:07.479 --> 39:08.714
What are you even saying?

39:08.714 --> 39:09.881
Tiger King, fuck off!

39:09.881 --> 39:11.750
Listen to me.
Fuck off.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.419
Go fucking fetch us some drinks
and get the fuck out of my face!

39:13.419 --> 39:14.486
What, I look like a fucking
bitch right now?

39:14.486 --> 39:15.921
- Yes, you are.
- Huh?

39:15.921 --> 39:17.489
Yes, you do.
You're very tough, aren't you?

39:17.489 --> 39:18.724
Go to the fucking bar.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.492
- Get some fucking drinks.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.060
Back up!

39:22.060 --> 39:23.462
Back the fuck up!

39:23.462 --> 39:25.296
Bunch of little
fucking bitches huh,

39:25.296 --> 39:26.965
when someone pulls a gun.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.233
Get your fucking hands off her.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.401
Nah, I like this girl.

39:29.401 --> 39:31.437
Get your fucking hands off her!

39:33.138 --> 39:34.740
Fucking pussy-ass bitch!

39:34.740 --> 39:36.675
Wes, come on.
Let's get out of here.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.478
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on, Wes.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.413
What you waiting for?

39:41.413 --> 39:43.949
Do it.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.751
I dare you.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.253
Do it! Come on.

39:48.253 --> 39:49.821
Do it. What you waiting for?

39:49.821 --> 39:51.490
Chava! Stop!

39:51.490 --> 39:53.291
This is my fucking bar!

39:53.291 --> 39:55.761
And everybody, it's closed. Go.

39:55.761 --> 39:56.995
Move your ass!

39:56.995 --> 39:58.464
And you too, sweetheart.

39:58.464 --> 39:59.598
- Get the fuck out of here.
Back off!

39:59.598 --> 40:01.166
Get your fucking hand off me!

40:01.166 --> 40:02.668
Who the fuck gave you
permission--

40:02.668 --> 40:04.770
These pricks think they can
fuck with me, man!

40:04.770 --> 40:06.371
Get the fuck out of here.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.806
- Fuck 'em up.
- Back the fuck off.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.641
- Listen, listen, listen, listen.
- I got back up.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.610
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.044
- Seriously, listen. All right.
Put the gun down.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.312
- It's down, all right.
- Move!

40:14.312 --> 40:15.847
Everybody shut the fuck up!

40:16.815 --> 40:18.450
He didn't mean nothing.
Get the fuck away.

40:18.450 --> 40:20.051
He fucking meant it.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.120
He fucking meant
to listen to me.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.556
I tried to give him a chance.

40:24.556 --> 40:27.493
You understand?
I tried to give him a chance.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.497
I said...
I said...

40:32.564 --> 40:34.466
You see this? <i>Aranas latino,</i>

40:34.466 --> 40:36.367
- motherfucker.
That's right.

40:36.367 --> 40:38.003
Do you know
what this shit fucking means?

40:38.003 --> 40:40.038
He disrespected me
in front of my people, man.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.306
Oh,
I'm so sorry about that.

40:41.306 --> 40:42.908
But you see this?

40:42.908 --> 40:45.143
And that's not from listening
to gangster rap.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.879
I'm asking you man to man.
He's a fucking moron.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.815
I'm asking you,
have a drink with me.

40:49.815 --> 40:51.683
- All you all, alright.
Fucking waste of alcohol!

40:51.683 --> 40:53.318
- Shut the fuck up, asshole.

40:53.318 --> 40:54.686
I'm talking
to you. Look...

40:54.686 --> 40:56.387
I don't want
your fucking drink, okay?

40:56.387 --> 40:58.023
I wanna fucking kill
this motherfucker.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.725
Okay, okay, okay. I'm asking you

40:59.725 --> 41:01.827
to have a drink with me.
I'll deal with him later.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.529
Please? Alright? Simple.

41:03.529 --> 41:05.263
I don't want your fucking drink!
You hear me?

41:05.263 --> 41:06.898
I want to fucking kill him!

41:06.898 --> 41:08.399
- Oh, whoa. Whoa.
You hear me?

41:08.399 --> 41:10.769
I want his fucking blood.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.671
Okay, you can have
his blood, okay.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.472
Let me just get out of here.

41:17.943 --> 41:19.210
You see, motherfucker?

41:19.210 --> 41:21.547
You see? You see, huh?

41:21.547 --> 41:24.516
When you pull out a fucking gun,
you see what happens, huh?

41:24.516 --> 41:26.284
You see that? You see that, huh?

41:26.284 --> 41:28.386
You see? You see
what the fuck happens!

41:29.220 --> 41:31.022
We're fucking killers now?

41:31.022 --> 41:33.191
This is not the way
it was supposed to happen.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.093
The FBI, Gabe?

41:37.195 --> 41:38.564
This changes nothing.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.733
They don't know shit.

41:42.901 --> 41:45.103
We stick together,
we finish this.

41:45.103 --> 41:46.471
Then we cut ties.

41:46.471 --> 41:47.973
And everybody gets
what they want.

41:49.074 --> 41:50.609
I don't know, man.

42:04.422 --> 42:06.391
I gotta go.

42:07.559 --> 42:08.627
No, I got it. Here,

42:08.627 --> 42:10.629
thank you for the beer.

42:10.629 --> 42:12.731
I do my thing.
I do my dirty work.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.733
can you tell me about?

42:14.733 --> 42:16.802
I did.

42:16.802 --> 42:19.070
He came in, all guns
blazing and shit.

42:19.070 --> 42:21.239
I didn't--
I didn't come in guns blazing.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.008
Wasn't a grand entrance.

42:24.610 --> 42:26.578
I gotta protect my stints.

42:26.578 --> 42:28.013
So you done
and fucked up.

42:29.615 --> 42:31.249
That was hot. That was--
Oh.

42:31.249 --> 42:32.684
And you put a fucking

42:32.684 --> 42:34.319
- revolver in my head.
Oh shit

42:34.319 --> 42:36.822
The party killer's here.
He's here.

42:36.822 --> 42:38.456
Hey, where'd the fuck
you come from?

42:38.456 --> 42:40.592
Come on, man. Come on.
Pick--come on.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.293
Take a seat right there and have

42:42.293 --> 42:43.929
- a drink with us, right?
- Let's go.

42:43.929 --> 42:45.263
What's the fuck
wrong with you, man?

42:45.263 --> 42:46.632
I'm just damn proud of him.

42:46.632 --> 42:48.366
He's part
of the brotherhood now.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.969
We got Ruben, Archangel Gabriel.

42:50.969 --> 42:52.604
And we got Superboy,

42:52.604 --> 42:55.373
and we got one motherfucking
family, right, Pike?

42:55.373 --> 42:56.642
Get in the truck.

42:57.475 --> 42:59.177
You never did know how
to have fun, did you?

42:59.177 --> 43:01.613
You should be like your little
brother more, you know?

43:01.613 --> 43:03.815
He's a little bit more loose.

43:03.815 --> 43:06.852
You wanna know
something?

43:06.852 --> 43:08.553
You used to be my hero
when we were young.

43:08.553 --> 43:10.288
- Get in the truck.

43:10.288 --> 43:11.857
Used to be the hero.

43:11.857 --> 43:13.191
Used to be.

43:13.191 --> 43:14.459
What the fuck is you--

43:14.459 --> 43:15.827
What's wrong with you?

43:16.662 --> 43:18.964
As I--as I recall,
you were the one who told me

43:18.964 --> 43:20.632
you won't take care
of this shit.

43:20.632 --> 43:22.968
You know? You vouched for him.

43:22.968 --> 43:25.203
I'm just having a drink
with him.

43:25.203 --> 43:26.872
And you know what?

43:26.872 --> 43:29.474
Your word, your precious word

43:29.474 --> 43:31.076
don't mean shit to me no more.

43:31.076 --> 43:33.879
And you got nothing
to say, do you?

43:35.280 --> 43:38.650
Your brother comes in here,
pulls out a gun in my place

43:38.650 --> 43:41.152
and I got three
fucking bodies to bury.

43:41.152 --> 43:43.021
- Give me a fucking shovel.

43:43.021 --> 43:45.657
Seriously, you're still
a man of few words.

43:45.657 --> 43:47.425
Give me a fucking shovel. Yeah.

43:47.425 --> 43:49.828
You know, seriously, you know
what your fucking problem is?

43:49.828 --> 43:53.364
Is you actually think
that you're silence

43:54.232 --> 43:56.167
bought you favors with me.

43:56.167 --> 44:00.238
And you could not be so
motherfucking wrong.

44:00.238 --> 44:01.873
Set up the bank meet.

44:02.908 --> 44:05.376
Stay the fuck away
from my brother.

44:05.376 --> 44:06.712
Hm.

44:13.551 --> 44:16.621
Sprout some wings,
Archangel Gabriel.

44:27.232 --> 44:28.466
Get in the truck.

44:32.771 --> 44:33.805
Come on!

44:45.083 --> 44:47.585
I told you to stay
the fuck away from Rader.

44:49.654 --> 44:51.389
You think it's a fucking game?

44:51.389 --> 44:52.623
Fucking game.

44:53.524 --> 44:54.893
Do you think
this is a game?

44:54.893 --> 44:56.995
And you love
playing a game, bitch.

44:56.995 --> 44:58.663
Fucking little brother
fucks shit up,

44:58.663 --> 45:00.265
big brother cleans it up.

45:00.265 --> 45:01.499
It's fucking merry-go-round shit

45:01.499 --> 45:03.634
that you get off on.

45:03.634 --> 45:05.036
Just drive.

45:32.130 --> 45:34.565
That some more shit
you steal from the old man?

45:36.634 --> 45:38.036
Shut your fucking mouth, man.

45:38.036 --> 45:39.771
You don't know
what it's fucking like.

45:39.771 --> 45:41.606
Why don't you fucking tell me?

45:41.606 --> 45:43.608
You wanna know about Iraq?

45:43.608 --> 45:45.176
- I don't give a fuck about Iraq.
- Huh?

45:45.176 --> 45:47.545
You wanna know about
all the explosions and shit!

45:47.545 --> 45:49.981
I wanna know why
you fucked up my job!

45:51.382 --> 45:52.717
Let me tell you something.

45:53.651 --> 45:55.720
Over there, I had my team.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.822
I had my unit.

45:56.822 --> 45:58.523
I had my brothers!

45:58.523 --> 46:00.992
And they had my fucking back!

46:00.992 --> 46:03.962
Every fucking day,
I put on a uniform

46:03.962 --> 46:06.064
that showed me
the respect I earn.

46:06.064 --> 46:07.966
Yeah, you don't wear
that uniform anymore.

46:07.966 --> 46:09.467
No, I'm not!

46:09.467 --> 46:11.736
You know what I am doing?

46:11.736 --> 46:13.638
Sweeping some fucking shop!

46:13.638 --> 46:16.908
Is that the best I got
to look forward to?

46:16.908 --> 46:19.177
Been home eight months!

46:23.348 --> 46:24.850
The best I got?

46:29.520 --> 46:31.022
And fucking my cigarette.

46:33.859 --> 46:37.528
You know, when we hit
that armored car,

46:38.930 --> 46:41.599
most alive I have felt
since coming home,

46:41.599 --> 46:43.501
can you believe that?

46:43.501 --> 46:44.936
Hm?

46:44.936 --> 46:46.938
I just thought
Wesley fucking Russell,

46:46.938 --> 46:49.574
you come back to your hometown
where your daddy

46:49.574 --> 46:50.909
and your big fucking brother,

46:50.909 --> 46:53.011
the same brother
who was your super hero,

46:53.011 --> 46:54.679
when you were a little boy.

46:54.679 --> 46:55.847
You could be just like then?

46:55.847 --> 46:57.682
You can be a part of something?

46:57.682 --> 46:59.684
I came back thinking
that I could--

46:59.684 --> 47:01.887
I could belong
to something, too.

47:01.887 --> 47:03.955
Can't you see
I'm trying to protect you?

47:03.955 --> 47:05.556
I don't need

47:05.556 --> 47:08.059
your fucking protection, motherfucker?

47:09.060 --> 47:11.662
I think I can take care
of myself, right?

47:13.464 --> 47:15.066
This shit gets in your blood.

47:16.567 --> 47:19.237
Takes over, makes you think
you're involved, but you're not.

47:20.305 --> 47:21.572
Neither am I.

47:22.573 --> 47:24.409
I'm trying
to look out for you, man.

47:26.711 --> 47:28.779
You know
what's really fucked up?

47:28.779 --> 47:30.949
Is whenever I shot
that armored guard,

47:33.818 --> 47:35.453
I don't feel
a fucking thing, man.

47:35.453 --> 47:38.789
I'm no better than some
fucking Hadji overseas.

47:39.590 --> 47:41.392
You need help.

47:41.392 --> 47:43.094
You know what would help me,

47:44.695 --> 47:47.165
is the bank job
that Rader mentioned.

47:47.165 --> 47:49.100
- No.
Hm.

47:52.603 --> 47:53.838
We're done.

47:55.473 --> 47:57.575
What are you talking about?

47:57.575 --> 47:58.843
No, fucking no.

48:01.212 --> 48:02.948
You gotta get
clean, brother.

48:03.848 --> 48:05.283
And I can't save you.

48:09.787 --> 48:11.889
Get the fuck out of my house.

48:12.690 --> 48:14.059
The fuck out!

48:20.698 --> 48:23.068
We'll be in touch, thank you.

48:24.302 --> 48:25.603
Just got off the phone

48:25.603 --> 48:26.837
with the owner
of the stolen car.

48:26.837 --> 48:28.773
Did we clear him?

48:28.773 --> 48:31.009
Roberts is working on it.
But get this,

48:31.009 --> 48:33.878
the owner discovered
the keyless entry FOB

48:33.878 --> 48:35.646
stopped working
prior to the robbery.

48:35.646 --> 48:38.016
- Okay. Is that a crime?
No,

48:38.016 --> 48:42.153
but whoever had
access to the car

48:42.153 --> 48:44.322
traded it out
with a lookalike FOB.

48:44.322 --> 48:46.324
Wouldn't raise questions
with the owner.

48:47.158 --> 48:49.327
Well, did they mention
who had access prior?

48:49.327 --> 48:50.695
Two weeks ago.

48:50.695 --> 48:53.164
Clemens Garage
and Wrecker Service.

48:53.999 --> 48:55.233
There's something else.

48:55.233 --> 48:56.701
Crime lab found
a tracking device

48:56.701 --> 48:58.003
underneath the steering column

48:58.003 --> 48:59.204
that survived the fire.

49:01.672 --> 49:03.674
You gotta be shitting me.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.810
Here's my theory.

49:05.810 --> 49:06.811
<i>Owner takes the car in</i>

49:06.811 --> 49:07.979
<i>for repair.</i>

49:07.979 --> 49:09.514
<i>Someone at the shop,</i>

49:09.514 --> 49:11.816
trades out the real FOB
with a fake one.

49:11.816 --> 49:13.184
Give me some
of those duplicates.

49:13.184 --> 49:14.652
<i>Then one of them plants</i>

49:14.652 --> 49:15.853
<i>a tracking device in the car.</i>

49:15.853 --> 49:17.155
They wait a few days.

49:17.155 --> 49:19.490
<i>They track the vehicle with GPS.</i>

49:19.490 --> 49:20.691
Almost there. Keep going, Gabe.

49:20.691 --> 49:22.227
<i>Locate the vehicle,</i>

49:22.227 --> 49:23.361
grab and go.

49:46.484 --> 49:47.752
Interesting skill set.

49:47.752 --> 49:49.054
Eliminate street thugs.

49:49.820 --> 49:53.158
And they'd have complete access
to the vehicle at the shop.

49:53.958 --> 49:55.226
That's good.

49:55.993 --> 49:57.895
Alright um,

49:57.895 --> 49:59.530
let's--let's question
the other owners

49:59.530 --> 50:01.566
of stolen cars, okay?

50:01.566 --> 50:03.901
See if they visited the shop.
See if they'll testify to it.

50:03.901 --> 50:05.636
Then I want any documentation
they have.

50:05.636 --> 50:09.874
Alright. Receipts, phony key
FOBS, phone calls, okay?

50:09.874 --> 50:12.277
They got a new carburetor,
I want to know the part number.

50:12.277 --> 50:14.045
And let's expedite it, right?

50:14.045 --> 50:15.580
I want to be there the next time
these assholes

50:15.580 --> 50:18.416
think they can take
a score in my city.

50:56.121 --> 50:57.488
What's the take?

50:57.488 --> 50:59.624
It's a $100,000
between two tellers

50:59.624 --> 51:01.259
at the front counter.

51:01.259 --> 51:03.494
There's an additional $100,000
right behind them

51:03.494 --> 51:04.695
at the drive-up windows.

51:04.695 --> 51:05.696
Every Wednesday,

51:05.696 --> 51:06.931
at 11:00 AM sharp,

51:06.931 --> 51:08.333
Wells Fargo delivers.

51:08.333 --> 51:10.301
Now they deliver cash
for that week's payroll.

51:10.301 --> 51:11.802
They're also picking up
any deposits

51:11.802 --> 51:13.138
that were put in the bank
that week.

51:13.138 --> 51:14.339
But that's about $400,000

51:14.339 --> 51:15.773
or $500,000.

51:15.773 --> 51:17.642
You mix that
with the bank's money

51:17.642 --> 51:21.212
and you're leaving with at least
half a million dollar take.

51:24.982 --> 51:26.050
What about security?

51:26.050 --> 51:27.785
No security. Wells Fargo guy

51:27.785 --> 51:29.120
will come in, he'll drop off,

51:29.120 --> 51:31.122
he'll pick up, and he's gone.

51:31.122 --> 51:33.624
- What about cameras?
- Yeah, there's cameras.

51:33.624 --> 51:36.026
But I'll have them disabled
for the day of

51:36.026 --> 51:37.895
for scheduled maintenance.

51:41.899 --> 51:43.234
So, what's your end?

51:43.234 --> 51:44.469
My end?

51:44.469 --> 51:45.836
It's 10%.

51:47.572 --> 51:49.640
Why does a bank manager
rob his own bank?

51:49.640 --> 51:51.142
You trust the bank.

51:51.142 --> 51:53.144
Banks are like the streets, man.

51:53.144 --> 51:56.481
You keep your eyes open,
you look both ways every time.

51:56.481 --> 51:58.883
You gotta be present
on the day of.

51:59.850 --> 52:00.851
I'll be there.

52:00.851 --> 52:02.353
Devland,

52:04.054 --> 52:07.024
I pray to God
that you completely understand

52:07.024 --> 52:09.727
what will happen
if this comes back on us.

52:09.727 --> 52:11.128
Yeah, I know.

52:14.532 --> 52:15.666
Get the schematics?

52:15.666 --> 52:16.967
Yeah.

52:20.271 --> 52:22.072
Everything you need
is right there.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.680
<i>Looks perfect, honey.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

52:29.680 --> 52:31.015
<i>Great job.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

52:31.015 --> 52:32.250
- Go get Chloe.
- Okay.

52:32.250 --> 52:33.718
- Okay.

52:33.718 --> 52:36.287
Actually, one minute.
I gotta take this.

52:36.287 --> 52:37.922
- It's the office. They--
Seriously?

52:37.922 --> 52:39.357
They know it's an important day.

52:39.357 --> 52:41.058
Right now?
- They wouldn't call me

52:41.058 --> 52:41.392
if they didn't find anything.
One--one second.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.262
Hello? Better be good.

52:44.262 --> 52:45.530
Hey.

52:45.530 --> 52:47.532
Grounded. Room.

52:47.532 --> 52:48.599
Now.

52:49.934 --> 52:51.035
Yeah, one minute.

52:51.035 --> 52:53.037
Let's go.

52:53.037 --> 52:54.639
Don't bug your sister.

52:54.639 --> 52:56.307
Alright.

52:56.307 --> 52:57.742
Callin' me at home
on my daughter's birthday,

52:57.742 --> 52:58.876
it better be good.

52:58.876 --> 53:00.411
Check your email.

53:01.412 --> 53:02.980
Okay.
- Per your request,

53:02.980 --> 53:05.049
I set up a meet
with the C.I. Remy.

53:05.049 --> 53:06.551
<i>He wants to meet tonight.</i>

53:07.785 --> 53:08.886
My man, Remy.

53:08.886 --> 53:10.455
- Brett!
- Yeah? Uh.

53:10.455 --> 53:11.722
Yeah, one minute.

53:11.722 --> 53:13.391
Honey, one minute, okay. Just...

53:13.391 --> 53:15.726
<i>- What am I looking at?</i>
- Open the attachment.

53:15.726 --> 53:18.396
<i>They're connected.
All stolen vehicles</i>

53:18.396 --> 53:20.798
visited the shop two weeks
prior to the robbery.

53:20.798 --> 53:22.099
And we cleared the owners?

53:22.099 --> 53:23.634
Ran into a problem.

53:23.634 --> 53:24.802
What kind of problem?

53:24.802 --> 53:26.437
Two of the owners have priors.

53:26.437 --> 53:28.273
<i>The others think
we're implicating them.</i>

53:28.273 --> 53:30.241
<i>- Refuse to testify.</i>
- Well, alright.

53:30.241 --> 53:31.742
We can force a deposition.

53:31.742 --> 53:33.944
Either way, we know these guys
are involved.

53:33.944 --> 53:35.946
<i>We need to move on this.</i>

53:37.448 --> 53:39.284
Alright listen, I want
to know everything there is

53:39.284 --> 53:40.751
about this shop. I want
to know everything there is

53:40.751 --> 53:42.453
about the people
working there, alright?

53:42.453 --> 53:44.255
They got any records.
See if they've ever

53:44.255 --> 53:46.257
employed felons before.

53:46.257 --> 53:48.759
Let's get surveillance
on them, ASAP. Alright?

53:48.759 --> 53:49.960
Right. Got it.

53:49.960 --> 53:51.629
Thank you.

53:51.629 --> 53:52.797
Okay.

55:06.571 --> 55:08.205
Oh yeah. Thanks.

55:10.541 --> 55:12.777
Is uh--is Dawnette
working today?

55:17.147 --> 55:18.383
What happened?

55:27.925 --> 55:29.159
Hey.

55:31.396 --> 55:33.030
- What can I get you?
I--I don't

55:33.030 --> 55:34.799
wanna talk to you right now.

55:35.766 --> 55:38.436
Do you feel like you can
drink or eat anything?

55:38.436 --> 55:40.405
I don't need your help, okay.

55:41.939 --> 55:43.307
I made it this far without you.

55:43.307 --> 55:44.909
I'm--I'm fine now.

55:46.076 --> 55:48.513
- I was trying to help.
It is my fault.

55:50.014 --> 55:51.582
You wouldn't understand.

55:53.818 --> 55:55.753
Help me understand.

56:01.426 --> 56:03.661
How are you feeling,
Miss Russell?

56:03.661 --> 56:04.762
Like shit.

56:05.796 --> 56:07.097
How is she?

56:10.167 --> 56:12.903
Luckily,
there's no broken bones.

56:12.903 --> 56:15.072
Just external abrasions.

56:15.072 --> 56:18.576
The good news is,
as of right now,

56:18.576 --> 56:20.478
the fetus hasn't miscarried.

56:21.546 --> 56:24.415
But that could change anytime
in the next 24 to 48 hours.

56:24.415 --> 56:28.352
There's just no way to know
yet what might happen.

56:28.352 --> 56:31.088
It all depends
on how your body responds.

56:31.088 --> 56:32.156
Okay.

56:32.957 --> 56:36.360
I'd, uh, like
to keep you another day

56:36.360 --> 56:38.629
to run some more tests.

56:40.965 --> 56:42.533
In situations like this,

56:42.533 --> 56:46.604
the hospital provides
a Case Manager,

56:46.604 --> 56:50.240
that I'd like you to, uh,
speak to.

56:51.308 --> 56:52.543
They'll be over soon.

57:01.151 --> 57:02.386
You should go.

57:05.590 --> 57:06.824
How far along are you?

57:08.726 --> 57:09.994
Two months.

57:10.928 --> 57:15.132
I already told Eddie about it
and he flipped out.

57:15.132 --> 57:18.335
Um, he thought I was trying to

57:19.369 --> 57:22.439
trap him or trick him
or something I guess.

57:24.441 --> 57:25.876
I don't know, maybe he's right.

57:28.178 --> 57:29.780
Was that Eddie at the diner?

57:31.882 --> 57:32.917
Yeah.

57:36.386 --> 57:37.855
You gonna say something?

57:41.058 --> 57:42.359
I'm leaving soon.

57:45.429 --> 57:46.764
I've got a place

57:47.798 --> 57:50.535
and I want more than anything
for you to go with me.

57:53.037 --> 57:54.104
We can start over.

57:54.939 --> 57:58.509
I can't--I can't
just pick up and leave.

57:58.509 --> 58:00.845
I mean
it's not that easy for me.

58:00.845 --> 58:02.412
I don't have any money.
I don't even know

58:02.412 --> 58:03.914
how I'm gonna pay for this.

58:05.049 --> 58:06.717
Let me worry about that.

58:11.556 --> 58:12.823
Just think about it.

58:26.737 --> 58:28.573
I do need one thing from you.

58:30.407 --> 58:31.742
What?

58:34.845 --> 58:36.446
I need to know
how to find Eddie.

58:48.092 --> 58:49.927
Who is it?

58:49.927 --> 58:50.995
Me.

58:57.668 --> 58:58.803
Yeah.

58:58.803 --> 59:00.605
What do you want?

59:01.972 --> 59:03.273
I've got a problem.

59:04.274 --> 59:05.676
You're asking me for help?

59:07.111 --> 59:08.278
Yeah.

59:08.278 --> 59:09.747
Alright.

59:09.747 --> 59:11.448
Why didn't you fuckin' say so?

59:45.983 --> 59:49.153
Alright, there's no back door
and only one way in.

59:49.153 --> 59:50.420
You got a gun?

59:52.322 --> 59:53.758
I don't need one.

1:00:06.804 --> 1:00:08.538
Who the fuck is it?

1:00:08.538 --> 1:00:10.741
Jehovah's fucking Witness,
open the door.

1:00:10.741 --> 1:00:11.909
Wes.

1:00:17.882 --> 1:00:18.949
Jesus.

1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:25.022
Look at me, motherfucker.

1:00:25.022 --> 1:00:27.557
Pack your shit
and get out of town.

1:00:27.557 --> 1:00:29.326
I don't ever want you
to talk to Dawn again.

1:00:29.326 --> 1:00:30.928
You hear me?

1:00:30.928 --> 1:00:32.396
Fuck you.

1:00:37.301 --> 1:00:38.769
Hey.

1:00:38.769 --> 1:00:39.569
Hey!

1:00:39.569 --> 1:00:40.905
Let go of me.

1:00:40.905 --> 1:00:42.006
Come on.

1:00:42.006 --> 1:00:43.073
You done.

1:00:45.209 --> 1:00:46.410
Done.

1:00:50.214 --> 1:00:51.381
Whoo!

1:00:51.381 --> 1:00:53.117
Pretty boy got fucked up.

1:01:03.060 --> 1:01:04.094
Hey.

1:01:06.063 --> 1:01:08.098
We're all over the place.
Pull over.

1:01:08.098 --> 1:01:09.599
It's fine.

1:01:09.599 --> 1:01:11.101
Pull the fuck over.

1:01:11.101 --> 1:01:12.737
Come on, slow down.

1:01:14.404 --> 1:01:15.605
Right there.

1:01:28.418 --> 1:01:30.320
Is my niece alright?

1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:31.922
Is she gonna be okay?

1:01:34.825 --> 1:01:36.260
Yeah.

1:01:36.260 --> 1:01:37.795
She's gonna be.

1:01:43.100 --> 1:01:44.501
I'm proud of you.

1:01:45.302 --> 1:01:47.171
Thanks for being there.

1:01:48.172 --> 1:01:49.673
Hmph.

1:01:50.775 --> 1:01:53.878
If you want in, you're in.

1:01:55.780 --> 1:01:57.581
You know what's funny
is for the first time

1:01:57.581 --> 1:01:59.950
I think I want out
of this place.

1:02:02.286 --> 1:02:04.989
By the looks of it,
think you do, too.

1:02:07.724 --> 1:02:08.959
Let's go.

1:02:24.241 --> 1:02:26.076
Hey, Remy.

1:02:33.683 --> 1:02:35.986
Well, what's up, Remy?

1:02:39.656 --> 1:02:40.858
Flat broke, man.

1:02:40.858 --> 1:02:42.526
Run-- run outta money again.

1:02:42.526 --> 1:02:45.729
Need a little help
from my friends.

1:02:45.729 --> 1:02:47.664
I got you right here.

1:02:50.667 --> 1:02:52.636
What, are they trying
to bring you back

1:02:52.636 --> 1:02:53.871
into the fold, huh?

1:02:53.871 --> 1:02:55.672
Oh, no, no, no, man.

1:02:55.672 --> 1:02:57.741
I told you,
I'm through with that shit.

1:02:57.741 --> 1:02:59.309
I'm not going back.

1:02:59.309 --> 1:03:02.179
Well, but is that life
through with you?

1:03:02.947 --> 1:03:05.149
Once you cross over,
you don't really come back.

1:03:05.149 --> 1:03:06.884
Quit fucking with me,
Super Agent man?

1:03:06.884 --> 1:03:08.418
Just tell me, what--
what the fuck you want?

1:03:08.418 --> 1:03:09.987
You heard about this crew

1:03:09.987 --> 1:03:11.488
that's been hitting
these armored cars?

1:03:11.488 --> 1:03:14.658
Yeah, I heard about 'em. So?

1:03:14.658 --> 1:03:16.393
Well, I was kinda hoping
a little birdie

1:03:16.393 --> 1:03:17.862
might have told you something.

1:03:17.862 --> 1:03:19.830
Yeah, it's a--
It's a big city, Remy,

1:03:19.830 --> 1:03:23.901
but it's a small,
organized crime underground.

1:03:23.901 --> 1:03:26.170
Yeah. I don't know who
these motherfuckers are, man.

1:03:26.170 --> 1:03:28.505
But they're grabbing
their shit quick.

1:03:28.505 --> 1:03:30.174
They jerking it off the streets.

1:03:30.174 --> 1:03:31.741
Shit, they're trying
to beat your record.

1:03:31.741 --> 1:03:34.011
Ain't nobody gonna break
my damn record, man.

1:03:34.011 --> 1:03:37.347
You know,
I was trying to get out, man.

1:03:37.347 --> 1:03:39.716
Your line of business
does have a shelf life, Remy.

1:03:39.716 --> 1:03:41.185
You want my opinion?

1:03:41.185 --> 1:03:43.220
Mhmmm.

1:03:43.220 --> 1:03:46.256
These boys are gonna grab
their money.

1:03:46.256 --> 1:03:48.725
They're gonna pay
all their damn bills off

1:03:48.725 --> 1:03:52.396
and then, they're gonna
disappear, man.

1:03:52.396 --> 1:03:55.065
And money gone, you ain't never
gonna see 'em again.

1:03:55.065 --> 1:03:56.633
Plus, I think
what's gonna happen,

1:03:56.633 --> 1:03:57.935
they're gonna stick
their goddamn toes

1:03:57.935 --> 1:03:59.870
in some sand
and laugh at your ass.

1:03:59.870 --> 1:04:01.605
So you don't recognize the M.O.?

1:04:01.605 --> 1:04:03.407
I don't recognize anything.

1:04:03.407 --> 1:04:04.909
Hmm. Why?

1:04:04.909 --> 1:04:06.210
'Cause you would have heard
something by now?

1:04:06.210 --> 1:04:07.577
I swear to God, man.

1:04:07.577 --> 1:04:10.147
I think somebody's
taking care of 'em, man.

1:04:10.147 --> 1:04:12.082
They'll take care of them
as long as they want to.

1:04:12.082 --> 1:04:15.185
And then at some point,
just like me,

1:04:16.153 --> 1:04:17.754
they get stuck.

1:04:17.754 --> 1:04:19.924
And when they're stuck,
they're fucked.

1:04:19.924 --> 1:04:22.759
Yeah. You know,
I just gave you a whole

1:04:22.759 --> 1:04:24.061
lot of money there, Remy.

1:04:24.061 --> 1:04:26.463
You haven't really told me shit.

1:04:26.463 --> 1:04:27.932
What the fuck you want?

1:04:29.333 --> 1:04:30.600
Well, who do you know
that can move

1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:32.602
that quantity of money?

1:04:32.602 --> 1:04:34.704
I mean, besides a casino?

1:04:36.606 --> 1:04:39.243
There's only one
motherfucker I can think of.

1:04:39.243 --> 1:04:40.744
Yeah, who's that?

1:04:40.744 --> 1:04:44.014
It's gotta be...

1:04:44.014 --> 1:04:46.183
goddamn Whitman Rader.

1:04:51.021 --> 1:04:52.589
<i>So, what happens now?</i>

1:04:52.589 --> 1:04:54.424
Come with me.

1:04:54.424 --> 1:04:57.527
Don't make promises
you can't keep, okay?

1:04:57.527 --> 1:04:59.163
No, listen.

1:05:01.331 --> 1:05:02.632
Two days.

1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:05.302
That's all I need.

1:05:06.470 --> 1:05:07.637
Why two days?

1:05:07.637 --> 1:05:09.639
Because I've got
some loose ends.

1:05:11.641 --> 1:05:13.143
Pack a bag.

1:05:13.143 --> 1:05:15.712
Just enough to get out of town.

1:05:15.712 --> 1:05:17.114
Meet me Wednesday night.

1:05:17.114 --> 1:05:19.083
We can leave from the diner.

1:05:20.850 --> 1:05:22.219
Can you do that?

1:05:24.688 --> 1:05:26.856
I won't let you down again.

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:29.960
<i>Okay, what have we got?</i>

1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:31.795
Wesley Allen Russell.

1:05:31.795 --> 1:05:33.663
Served eight years in the Army.

1:05:33.663 --> 1:05:34.898
Five in the Rangers.

1:05:34.898 --> 1:05:36.800
Ran him. No priors.

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:38.702
Discharged after popping hot
for cocaine

1:05:38.702 --> 1:05:40.971
after a two week recce in Iraq.

1:05:40.971 --> 1:05:43.307
Been employed at the shop
ever since his return.

1:05:43.307 --> 1:05:46.143
And most recently,
became the proud owner

1:05:46.143 --> 1:05:48.878
of a new Roush Mustang.

1:05:51.681 --> 1:05:53.217
Guy thinks he's Magnum P.I.

1:05:53.217 --> 1:05:56.320
What I wanna know is,
how does someone afford

1:05:56.320 --> 1:05:58.022
this car on minimum wage?

1:05:58.022 --> 1:06:00.257
- Well, that's our position.
Mmhmm.

1:06:00.257 --> 1:06:02.659
He'd also have knowledge
of weapons and tactics.

1:06:02.659 --> 1:06:04.528
The plot thickens.

1:06:04.528 --> 1:06:05.996
Hm.

1:06:05.996 --> 1:06:07.231
Rader, what do we know
about him?

1:06:07.231 --> 1:06:09.699
Owns a local dive
outside of town.

1:06:09.699 --> 1:06:12.436
But get this, 25 years ago,

1:06:12.436 --> 1:06:15.605
Rader was running organized
crime in Dallas County.

1:06:15.605 --> 1:06:17.874
Has a jacket as long as my arm.

1:06:17.874 --> 1:06:20.677
Goes off the map in about '04.

1:06:20.677 --> 1:06:22.046
Been clean ever since.

1:06:22.046 --> 1:06:23.580
And how does Wesley
track with Radar?

1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:27.184
Word on the street
is that he frequents his bar.

1:06:27.184 --> 1:06:28.518
Okay. Let's run
through Intelligence.

1:06:28.518 --> 1:06:30.354
See what they find out.

1:06:30.354 --> 1:06:31.755
What about this guy?

1:06:31.755 --> 1:06:33.090
Big guy?
Yeah.

1:06:33.090 --> 1:06:34.291
- We're not sure yet.
Okay.

1:06:34.291 --> 1:06:35.925
- And?
Shop foreman.

1:06:35.925 --> 1:06:37.127
And the Spanish guy?

1:06:37.127 --> 1:06:39.029
Too many to track.

1:06:39.029 --> 1:06:41.931
The shop employs mostly
Spanish speaking personnel.

1:06:43.733 --> 1:06:44.934
What's our move?

1:06:46.903 --> 1:06:48.438
Where is this
Wesley Russell now?

1:06:48.438 --> 1:06:50.774
Surveillance tracked him
to a dance club.

1:06:50.774 --> 1:06:51.941
What, strippers?

1:06:51.941 --> 1:06:53.377
Could be washing the money.

1:06:53.377 --> 1:06:55.445
Let's bring him in.
I want to talk to him.

1:07:07.924 --> 1:07:09.393
Mr. Russell?

1:07:09.393 --> 1:07:11.995
FBI!
In the car!

1:07:11.995 --> 1:07:13.830
In the fucking car!

1:07:15.599 --> 1:07:16.566
You got me.

1:07:34.818 --> 1:07:36.019
Has he said anything?

1:07:36.019 --> 1:07:38.422
Not a word.

1:07:38.422 --> 1:07:39.589
Oh, good.

1:07:39.589 --> 1:07:41.057
We'll let him sweat a little.

1:07:42.492 --> 1:07:43.793
Don't spook him.

1:07:43.793 --> 1:07:45.429
We don't need him to lawyer up.

1:07:47.531 --> 1:07:49.999
Well, let's keep it simple then.

1:07:49.999 --> 1:07:51.801
Mr. Russell.

1:07:51.801 --> 1:07:53.470
Finally.

1:07:53.470 --> 1:07:54.704
Do you have a cigarette?

1:07:54.704 --> 1:07:56.606
- No.
- No. I'm Agent Jordan.

1:07:56.606 --> 1:07:58.175
This is Agent Solomon.

1:07:58.175 --> 1:08:00.043
That's fucking great.
Am I in trouble or something?

1:08:00.043 --> 1:08:01.711
Well, not unless you're married.

1:08:01.711 --> 1:08:03.947
Got a little glitter
on your shoulder there, bud.

1:08:03.947 --> 1:08:05.982
We just have a few questions
for you.

1:08:05.982 --> 1:08:08.185
How long have you worked
at Clemens?

1:08:08.185 --> 1:08:10.654
Uh, few months I guess.

1:08:10.654 --> 1:08:11.855
Yeah, give or take.

1:08:11.855 --> 1:08:13.523
What's the pay like there?

1:08:13.523 --> 1:08:15.225
Pay? Fucking pay.

1:08:15.225 --> 1:08:17.494
You know what? That's exactly
what I was saying.

1:08:17.494 --> 1:08:19.062
Right, we were just talking
about this.

1:08:19.062 --> 1:08:21.565
I mean, a Ranger, right?

1:08:21.565 --> 1:08:24.000
Sweeping floors at a garage.
That's grunt work.

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.069
It can't pay more
than minimum wage.

1:08:26.069 --> 1:08:28.004
I ain't no fucking grunt.

1:08:28.004 --> 1:08:29.473
Okay, okay.

1:08:29.473 --> 1:08:31.341
I gotta, uh, a kid,
he's about to turn 16.

1:08:31.341 --> 1:08:33.310
My wife and I were about
to get him a new ride.

1:08:33.310 --> 1:08:35.479
But, uh, you know,
they're not cheap.

1:08:35.479 --> 1:08:36.980
Cars these days.

1:08:36.980 --> 1:08:40.517
And I noticed
that you got a new car.

1:08:41.251 --> 1:08:42.686
So, I was just wondering,

1:08:42.686 --> 1:08:44.821
how does someone afford
something like that

1:08:44.821 --> 1:08:47.591
on minimum wage?

1:08:47.591 --> 1:08:48.858
Hazard pay.

1:08:48.858 --> 1:08:51.195
From the shoot 'em up,
Army days.

1:08:51.195 --> 1:08:52.896
Army left you
a hazard pay.

1:08:52.896 --> 1:08:54.531
Of course, they probably left
you with some other things.

1:08:54.531 --> 1:08:56.433
Right?

1:08:56.433 --> 1:08:58.335
Weapons training?

1:08:58.335 --> 1:08:59.403
Hostage tactics?

1:08:59.403 --> 1:09:02.206
Maybe, uh, a chip
on your shoulder?

1:09:02.972 --> 1:09:04.241
Where's this going?

1:09:04.241 --> 1:09:06.343
Look, Mr. Russell,
explain to us--

1:09:06.343 --> 1:09:08.111
How do you know Whitman Rader?

1:09:10.380 --> 1:09:11.881
You look like a nice lady.

1:09:11.881 --> 1:09:13.850
Is this one of those moments
where I need a lawyer?

1:09:13.850 --> 1:09:15.185
Well, well,
I don't know.

1:09:15.185 --> 1:09:17.120
You know it's not a bad idea, right?

1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:19.623
But, usually,
in our line of work,

1:09:19.623 --> 1:09:21.057
if somebody needs a lawyer,

1:09:21.057 --> 1:09:23.026
uh, they have something
to hide so...

1:09:23.026 --> 1:09:24.594
I don't know
a fucking Whitman Rader.

1:09:24.594 --> 1:09:26.430
Okay. That's weird.

1:09:26.430 --> 1:09:29.399
That is weird though,
because the word on the street

1:09:29.399 --> 1:09:32.101
is you frequent his bar
quite a bit.

1:09:32.101 --> 1:09:33.470
- Solomon.
- What? We're just talking.

1:09:33.470 --> 1:09:35.205
We're just talking here,
all right?

1:09:35.205 --> 1:09:37.574
Just-- just-- just tell me
how you know the guy?

1:09:37.574 --> 1:09:40.277
Yeah, and that's my cue,
I'll take uh,

1:09:40.277 --> 1:09:41.878
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

1:09:41.878 --> 1:09:43.247
I'll take that, uh, that lawyer.

1:09:43.247 --> 1:09:44.781
Listen, I, uh, I apologize.

1:09:44.781 --> 1:09:46.082
Shit. I'm sorry.

1:09:46.082 --> 1:09:47.484
We got off
on the wrong foot here.

1:09:47.484 --> 1:09:48.418
How about this?

1:09:48.418 --> 1:09:49.819
I'll make you another deal.

1:09:49.819 --> 1:09:52.722
You tell me who this is

1:09:52.722 --> 1:09:54.924
and, uh, you're free to go.

1:10:01.965 --> 1:10:04.501
Moving, cover.

1:10:04.501 --> 1:10:05.635
Shot!

1:10:05.635 --> 1:10:06.836
Moving!

1:10:06.836 --> 1:10:08.338
Cover!

1:10:08.338 --> 1:10:11.007
Shot.
Moving.

1:10:11.007 --> 1:10:12.576
- Shot!
Shot.

1:10:12.576 --> 1:10:14.344
Moving. Shot!

1:10:24.854 --> 1:10:26.756
Taught you fucks well.

1:10:26.756 --> 1:10:28.692
Get a few rounds in?

1:10:28.692 --> 1:10:31.261
No. What do you want?

1:10:31.261 --> 1:10:32.962
You look like shit.

1:10:33.830 --> 1:10:35.265
Yeah.

1:10:35.265 --> 1:10:36.433
I wanted to see you.

1:10:36.433 --> 1:10:38.402
We're meeting tomorrow night.

1:10:41.705 --> 1:10:43.407
The fuck's wrong with you?

1:10:46.976 --> 1:10:48.578
We need to talk.

1:10:51.648 --> 1:10:53.650
So how'd they
pick up on you?

1:10:54.651 --> 1:10:56.185
The Roush.

1:10:56.986 --> 1:10:58.688
What'd you tell 'em?

1:10:58.688 --> 1:11:01.157
Nothing.
- No. No, look at me.

1:11:03.159 --> 1:11:04.561
What did you tell them?

1:11:04.561 --> 1:11:07.564
Nothing, man.
I didn't tell them shit.

1:11:07.564 --> 1:11:09.232
Okay, I swear.

1:11:09.232 --> 1:11:11.535
Do they know
about the bank?

1:11:12.336 --> 1:11:15.772
No, but they're--
they're curious about Rader.

1:11:16.540 --> 1:11:19.275
Wanna know how
I figure into things.

1:11:20.109 --> 1:11:21.511
They know about me?

1:11:22.245 --> 1:11:23.813
Yeah, this F--

1:11:23.813 --> 1:11:26.149
This FBI dude Agent Solomon,
he's smart.

1:11:26.149 --> 1:11:27.216
Do they know about me?

1:11:27.216 --> 1:11:29.486
He fucking knows about you!

1:11:29.486 --> 1:11:30.654
Okay?

1:11:30.654 --> 1:11:32.389
It's the FBI!

1:11:36.860 --> 1:11:39.696
We play this game
until we're done, Gabe.

1:11:40.630 --> 1:11:42.231
Gotta call it off.

1:11:45.101 --> 1:11:46.736
It's over, baby.

1:11:48.372 --> 1:11:50.106
Gabe, what are we gonna do?

1:12:01.017 --> 1:12:02.285
Damn.

1:12:02.285 --> 1:12:03.853
That's a nice shop.

1:12:03.853 --> 1:12:06.155
That's what dirty money
gets you, huh?

1:12:08.725 --> 1:12:09.759
Huh.

1:12:12.896 --> 1:12:16.265
You must be, uh,
Ruben Russell's son?

1:12:17.133 --> 1:12:18.535
Ran narcotics for, uh,

1:12:18.535 --> 1:12:20.236
Whitman Rader back in the '90s?

1:12:20.236 --> 1:12:21.905
Gabriel Russell, right?

1:12:21.905 --> 1:12:23.206
That's right. Who are you?

1:12:23.206 --> 1:12:24.908
Oh, sorry.

1:12:24.908 --> 1:12:26.376
Agent Solomon.

1:12:26.376 --> 1:12:28.111
You know, Gabriel, I had a--

1:12:28.111 --> 1:12:31.114
a really nice chat
with your brother.

1:12:31.114 --> 1:12:32.416
Told me all about you.

1:12:33.750 --> 1:12:35.885
I mean, he only had
nice things to say, of course.

1:12:35.885 --> 1:12:38.388
In fact, I think he looks up
to you, if you ask me.

1:12:38.388 --> 1:12:40.056
Can I help you with something?

1:12:40.056 --> 1:12:41.891
Well, actually
I was gonna see if--

1:12:41.891 --> 1:12:43.793
you know, maybe if I showed you
some photographs.

1:12:43.793 --> 1:12:45.895
If you could answer some
questions about 'em for me?

1:12:45.895 --> 1:12:47.163
I'm pretty busy.

1:12:47.163 --> 1:12:48.632
Well, just take a minute.

1:12:50.266 --> 1:12:51.801
Does that ring any bells?

1:12:53.169 --> 1:12:55.371
Oh, come on, buddy.
That's not your barbeque?

1:12:56.440 --> 1:12:57.841
Oh, wait.
Let me show you my favorite.

1:12:57.841 --> 1:12:59.443
This is great.

1:12:59.443 --> 1:13:02.011
You guys left that
underneath that last car.

1:13:04.448 --> 1:13:05.982
Thought you were
smarter than that.

1:13:05.982 --> 1:13:07.183
No idea.

1:13:07.183 --> 1:13:08.284
Nothing, huh?

1:13:08.284 --> 1:13:10.186
Hm. Well, that's all right.

1:13:10.186 --> 1:13:12.422
Federal Agents are actually
combing through your place

1:13:12.422 --> 1:13:13.823
right now as we speak.

1:13:15.358 --> 1:13:17.093
FBI!

1:13:17.093 --> 1:13:18.361
Got a warrant.

1:13:20.229 --> 1:13:21.665
Check those cabinets.

1:13:21.665 --> 1:13:23.433
Check that room.
Turn this place upside down.

1:13:23.433 --> 1:13:26.102
- Clear.

1:13:26.102 --> 1:13:27.637
You know I read your file.

1:13:27.637 --> 1:13:30.474
You spent 16 years in prison.

1:13:30.474 --> 1:13:31.708
Because you wouldn't
give up information

1:13:31.708 --> 1:13:33.342
about your criminal associates.

1:13:33.342 --> 1:13:35.479
Yeah, I don't betray
my brothers.

1:13:35.479 --> 1:13:36.846
I love it, you guys

1:13:36.846 --> 1:13:39.649
and your brotherhood
criminal bullshit.

1:13:40.416 --> 1:13:41.651
So many secrets.

1:13:45.154 --> 1:13:47.223
Speaking of brotherhood though,
what about the, uh,

1:13:47.223 --> 1:13:49.826
the hit they put out on you?

1:13:51.027 --> 1:13:53.797
Man, I heard you put that guy
in the hospital for a month.

1:13:53.797 --> 1:13:56.032
I mean somebody put
a green light on you, Gabriel.

1:13:56.032 --> 1:13:58.468
Somebody must have thought
you were gonna talk.

1:13:58.468 --> 1:14:00.504
Is that why your father
stopped working with Rader?

1:14:03.239 --> 1:14:04.508
Clear!

1:14:04.508 --> 1:14:06.009
Just-- just answer me one thing.

1:14:06.009 --> 1:14:08.377
Just-- just tell me why?

1:14:08.377 --> 1:14:09.846
Why, what?

1:14:09.846 --> 1:14:12.982
Why take down scores again
for your own boss?

1:14:12.982 --> 1:14:15.519
You must be confused.

1:14:15.519 --> 1:14:16.920
I don't do that anymore.

1:14:18.387 --> 1:14:19.756
Time changes us.

1:14:19.756 --> 1:14:21.057
Well, that's where
I think you're wrong.

1:14:21.057 --> 1:14:22.492
I think time,

1:14:22.492 --> 1:14:25.294
for people like you,
is a weapon.

1:14:27.196 --> 1:14:29.499
<i>So, I guess it's just
a coincidence, huh?</i>

1:14:29.499 --> 1:14:32.702
That every owner
of a stolen vehicle

1:14:32.702 --> 1:14:36.172
has visited this shop
before the robberies.

1:14:36.172 --> 1:14:37.206
What a mystery.

1:14:37.206 --> 1:14:38.374
Hm. The odds?

1:14:43.212 --> 1:14:44.514
You know, you and your crew,

1:14:44.514 --> 1:14:45.882
you killed that guard.

1:14:46.716 --> 1:14:48.251
For that, you're gonna burn.

1:14:50.119 --> 1:14:52.121
It's over for you, Gabriel.

1:14:52.121 --> 1:14:53.623
You know what's coming for you.

1:14:53.623 --> 1:14:56.793
Whatever's over for me,
came a long time ago.

1:14:57.594 --> 1:14:59.963
Glad we agree on something.

1:14:59.963 --> 1:15:01.631
Have a nice day.

1:15:01.631 --> 1:15:03.733
Hey, Wesley. Good to see you.

1:18:19.528 --> 1:18:20.930
Hi, baby.

1:18:28.204 --> 1:18:30.606
Oh, shit.

1:18:32.942 --> 1:18:33.977
Hello?

1:18:36.846 --> 1:18:37.947
What?

1:18:39.115 --> 1:18:40.183
What happened?

1:18:48.291 --> 1:18:49.826
You have them?

1:18:49.826 --> 1:18:51.460
Looks good.

1:18:52.628 --> 1:18:54.530
Hey.

1:18:54.530 --> 1:18:55.965
For good reason.

1:18:55.965 --> 1:18:58.534
I don't think
anybody here can argue,

1:18:59.535 --> 1:19:02.271
$640,000 for one day's work.

1:19:02.271 --> 1:19:03.940
Not too bad, right?

1:19:03.940 --> 1:19:06.642
So, the accountant
will be at the site

1:19:06.642 --> 1:19:08.978
to exchange the cash
as soon as you arrive.

1:19:08.978 --> 1:19:10.179
We're ready.

1:19:11.014 --> 1:19:13.016
10:55 sharp we're at the bank.

1:19:13.016 --> 1:19:15.284
Park on the side, but coming
strong through the front.

1:19:15.284 --> 1:19:17.821
Upon our entry, I separate
the tellers from the alarms.

1:19:17.821 --> 1:19:19.956
Control the counters,
and the window.

1:19:19.956 --> 1:19:23.059
I'ma manage all the bank guests
and communication devices.

1:19:23.059 --> 1:19:25.461
Tablets, cell phones, I got it.

1:19:25.461 --> 1:19:27.696
Once we're in,
the world is ours.

1:19:27.696 --> 1:19:29.799
No panic buttons, no calls out.

1:19:29.799 --> 1:19:31.234
Get the bank's money,

1:19:31.234 --> 1:19:32.969
we wait for the armored car
to arrive.

1:19:32.969 --> 1:19:34.971
When it does, guard walks in,
we take him down.

1:19:34.971 --> 1:19:37.673
Frisked, zipped,
nobody gets hurt.

1:19:37.673 --> 1:19:39.175
Nobody dies.

1:19:40.176 --> 1:19:42.478
And we're back here
tomorrow morning, 10:00.

1:19:42.478 --> 1:19:44.647
Got it, bro.

1:19:44.647 --> 1:19:47.050
Gabe. Wait.

1:19:51.054 --> 1:19:53.923
Yeah, I got this, uh,
sneaky suspicion

1:19:53.923 --> 1:19:56.993
that you-- you gotta
tell me something.

1:19:56.993 --> 1:19:58.995
Or you got something
to say to me?

1:19:58.995 --> 1:20:00.529
So, just say it.

1:20:02.531 --> 1:20:03.699
I got nothing to say to you.

1:20:03.699 --> 1:20:05.268
You got nothing?

1:20:07.370 --> 1:20:09.538
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

1:20:12.141 --> 1:20:13.209
Good.

1:20:14.610 --> 1:20:16.345
All good?

1:20:16.345 --> 1:20:18.347
Yeah, we stick with the plan.

1:20:18.347 --> 1:20:19.715
Let's go.

1:20:24.954 --> 1:20:26.255
What happened?

1:20:26.255 --> 1:20:27.656
We lost 'em.

1:20:29.392 --> 1:20:31.527
- What does that mean?
- It means that somehow

1:20:31.527 --> 1:20:32.896
they evaded our surveillance.

1:20:32.896 --> 1:20:34.263
It's a rhetorical question,
all right?

1:20:34.263 --> 1:20:36.265
I know what it means.
What about, uh,

1:20:36.265 --> 1:20:37.533
what about Wes' car?

1:20:37.533 --> 1:20:39.368
Well, it's still
parked downtown.

1:20:39.368 --> 1:20:40.536
He never came back for it.

1:20:40.536 --> 1:20:42.872
Okay. Well then, yeah, easy fix.

1:20:42.872 --> 1:20:44.240
Right? We focus on his brother.

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:45.541
Same with Gabriel.

1:20:45.541 --> 1:20:47.043
His truck is still
at the garage.

1:20:47.043 --> 1:20:49.312
And we didn't find anything
at Gabriel's place.

1:20:49.312 --> 1:20:50.880
It was clean, Solomon.

1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:54.583
And we have cars
outside their homes right now.

1:20:54.583 --> 1:20:56.219
- Correct? Right now?
We do.

1:20:56.219 --> 1:20:57.453
They're not there.

1:20:57.453 --> 1:20:58.988
I mean, it's--
it's two common thugs, guys.

1:20:58.988 --> 1:21:00.289
I mean, what--
what about their father?

1:21:00.289 --> 1:21:01.657
What about, uh, Ruben?

1:21:01.657 --> 1:21:04.727
Off the grid. No known address.

1:21:04.727 --> 1:21:06.129
All right, well...

1:21:07.596 --> 1:21:09.465
Fuck it.
We'll contact Gabe's PO.

1:21:09.465 --> 1:21:11.267
We don't have a case yet, Solomon.

1:21:11.267 --> 1:21:13.169
If the PO catches wind
that we're onto him,

1:21:13.169 --> 1:21:15.504
he's gonna arrest him
for parole violation.

1:21:15.504 --> 1:21:18.507
He's gonna serve out
his remaining sentence and walk.

1:21:18.507 --> 1:21:19.943
That what you want?

1:21:27.283 --> 1:21:29.118
Are we not the FBI?

1:21:31.454 --> 1:21:32.855
Figure it out.

1:21:49.872 --> 1:21:51.874
Come to make your peace?

1:21:54.210 --> 1:21:55.244
I am.

1:22:01.184 --> 1:22:02.751
I'm leaving.

1:22:05.054 --> 1:22:06.822
I'm taking Dawn with me.

1:22:08.424 --> 1:22:09.993
You know what to do?

1:22:11.227 --> 1:22:13.096
Yes, sir.

1:22:16.065 --> 1:22:18.234
Then let this be it for us.

1:22:34.083 --> 1:22:36.719
I'll hold the space
for you, son.

1:22:45.528 --> 1:22:47.196
Hey, can-- let me call you back.

1:22:49.365 --> 1:22:50.866
This is the remaining balance
on the property

1:22:50.866 --> 1:22:52.368
and some start-up cash.

1:22:53.302 --> 1:22:55.171
Can you put the deed
in someone's else's name?

1:22:55.171 --> 1:22:56.705
I sure can.

1:23:04.613 --> 1:23:05.914
Can I trust you?

1:23:05.914 --> 1:23:07.350
Of course.

1:23:07.350 --> 1:23:08.717
Thank you.

1:23:08.717 --> 1:23:10.753
You're welcome, Gabe.

1:23:17.626 --> 1:23:18.727
Hey.

1:23:18.727 --> 1:23:20.029
Go ahead.

1:23:20.029 --> 1:23:21.530
Tell me some good,
we got anything?

1:23:21.530 --> 1:23:23.366
No, we got nothing.

1:23:34.410 --> 1:23:35.778
Can I help you?

1:23:37.113 --> 1:23:39.248
We're actually closed.

1:23:46.189 --> 1:23:47.890
Hello.

1:23:47.890 --> 1:23:49.858
Who killed my little brother?

1:23:51.427 --> 1:23:52.461
Oh.

1:23:54.930 --> 1:23:58.334
Well, information costs money.

1:23:58.334 --> 1:24:00.469
At least,
in my neck of the woods.

1:24:03.872 --> 1:24:05.108
Hm.

1:24:41.043 --> 1:24:42.311
Baby?

1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:45.448
Yeah?

1:24:45.448 --> 1:24:46.482
I'm packed.

1:25:26.955 --> 1:25:28.056
Baby!
No!

1:26:29.785 --> 1:26:31.887
Yeah?

1:26:31.887 --> 1:26:33.155
How are you?

1:26:34.590 --> 1:26:35.991
Um, better.

1:26:38.527 --> 1:26:40.329
Everything's gonna be
all right now.

1:26:41.797 --> 1:26:43.432
New beginnings.

1:26:50.205 --> 1:26:52.308
Are you there?

1:26:52.308 --> 1:26:54.643
Uh, yeah.

1:26:54.643 --> 1:26:55.944
New beginnings.

1:26:57.212 --> 1:26:58.481
Be ready tonight.

1:27:00.048 --> 1:27:01.284
I will.

1:27:02.385 --> 1:27:03.452
Okay.

1:27:45.828 --> 1:27:47.162
Hey, Gabe.

1:27:48.030 --> 1:27:49.732
We can't wait for him, man.

1:27:49.732 --> 1:27:50.999
We gotta go.

1:28:19.762 --> 1:28:21.664
Where's Superboy?

1:28:21.664 --> 1:28:23.065
I don't know.

1:28:23.065 --> 1:28:25.434
You don't know?
- Do you?

1:28:25.434 --> 1:28:26.735
How the fuck would I know
where he is?

1:28:26.735 --> 1:28:28.371
You're the one
who vouched for him.

1:28:29.538 --> 1:28:31.273
Superboy probably skipped town.

1:28:31.273 --> 1:28:32.508
Mm-hmm.

1:28:32.508 --> 1:28:34.377
Which is probably for the best.

1:28:34.377 --> 1:28:37.045
So, it looks like
you're gonna need a third man.

1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:40.349
Would you do me a favor?
Go with him?

1:28:40.349 --> 1:28:42.084
No, fuck that.
He's not going with us.

1:28:42.084 --> 1:28:43.519
Well, he knows the workups.

1:28:43.519 --> 1:28:45.187
And uh, he can control the room

1:28:45.187 --> 1:28:46.789
better than even I can.

1:28:46.789 --> 1:28:48.190
All right.

1:28:48.190 --> 1:28:50.593
By the way, you don't have
any time left.

1:28:50.593 --> 1:28:52.094
You're out of it.

1:28:52.094 --> 1:28:54.563
So, don't even think about
disagreeing with me, all right?

1:28:56.899 --> 1:28:58.467
You make me proud, okay?

1:28:58.467 --> 1:29:00.503
- I got you.
- Throw him the ropes.

1:29:16.318 --> 1:29:18.186
Give me the fucking vest.

1:29:58.461 --> 1:29:59.995
All stations,
can I get a sit rep?

1:29:59.995 --> 1:30:01.296
Baker 218, to Adam 12,

1:30:01.296 --> 1:30:02.865
we are on stage and location.

1:30:12.407 --> 1:30:14.376
Parking lot secure.

1:30:15.544 --> 1:30:17.379
Stay off the radio.

1:30:31.827 --> 1:30:33.161
What do we do?

1:30:39.735 --> 1:30:40.769
It's time.

1:30:46.542 --> 1:30:49.011
Everybody get down on the floor!

1:30:49.011 --> 1:30:50.646
Get down on your knees!

1:30:50.646 --> 1:30:52.848
- Get down on your knees!
Get on the ground.

1:30:52.848 --> 1:30:54.216
Hands up! Hands up!

1:30:55.818 --> 1:30:57.352
- Hands on your head!
Listen up, listen up.

1:30:57.352 --> 1:30:59.221
Everybody, be calm.
Everybody, be calm.

1:30:59.221 --> 1:31:01.490
You wanna sit
the fuck down!

1:31:01.490 --> 1:31:02.558
Take out your cellphones.

1:31:02.558 --> 1:31:04.259
Put them on the ground.

1:31:04.259 --> 1:31:06.729
Do it! Quickly!

1:31:08.531 --> 1:31:09.998
Loose bills.
Just leave the cash.

1:31:09.998 --> 1:31:11.667
No dye packs. You understand me?

1:31:11.667 --> 1:31:13.702
See this little boy out here.
He wants to go home today.

1:31:13.702 --> 1:31:15.504
Your turn.
Nice and easy.

1:31:15.504 --> 1:31:17.540
Get the fuck down.

1:31:18.373 --> 1:31:19.942
You! Get out here!

1:31:19.942 --> 1:31:21.409
On your knees.

1:31:21.409 --> 1:31:22.911
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the bank manager.

1:31:22.911 --> 1:31:24.613
Bullshit!
- Don't you fucking lie to me.

1:31:24.613 --> 1:31:26.014
- Where's Devland?
- I told you.

1:31:26.014 --> 1:31:27.349
I'm warning you.
Everybody, out.

1:31:27.349 --> 1:31:30.418
Let's go.

1:31:30.418 --> 1:31:31.620
On your knees.
- Everybody's doing great.

1:31:31.620 --> 1:31:33.121
- Everybody's doing great.
- Come on.

1:31:33.121 --> 1:31:34.422
Everybody, be calm.

1:31:34.422 --> 1:31:35.858
Hands
on your fucking heads.

1:31:35.858 --> 1:31:37.560
Right here.
On your knees.

1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:40.195
On knees, come on.
Break this down!

1:31:40.195 --> 1:31:41.930
I need you to give this
to Agent Solomon.

1:31:41.930 --> 1:31:43.231
Do you understand me?

1:31:44.432 --> 1:31:46.101
What's going on?

1:31:46.101 --> 1:31:47.536
Ho, ho! Ho!

1:31:47.536 --> 1:31:49.237
What the fuck is going on
with you, motherfuckers?

1:31:50.438 --> 1:31:51.874
What do you got going on?

1:31:51.874 --> 1:31:53.208
Whoa, hey!

1:31:53.208 --> 1:31:54.442
Hey! What are you--

1:31:54.442 --> 1:31:56.378
Look at me. Easy. Easy.

1:31:56.378 --> 1:31:57.780
Hold on, Pike.

1:31:57.780 --> 1:31:58.814
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

1:31:58.814 --> 1:32:00.415
Put the gun down.

1:32:00.415 --> 1:32:02.050
Fuck this.

1:32:02.050 --> 1:32:03.886
We don't do this.
Uh-uh. This is my show.

1:32:03.886 --> 1:32:05.220
Easy, Pike.
Right here, hey.

1:32:05.220 --> 1:32:06.421
Calm down.

1:32:06.421 --> 1:32:07.389
What are you doing?
Fucking me?

1:32:07.389 --> 1:32:08.724
Hey. Look at me!

1:32:08.724 --> 1:32:10.292
I ain't going down
like this, son.

1:32:10.292 --> 1:32:11.293
Put it down.
- Get over there, motherfucker.

1:32:11.293 --> 1:32:13.095
Move! Over here!

1:32:13.095 --> 1:32:14.296
You get over here, motherfucker.

1:32:14.296 --> 1:32:15.564
Get the fuck o--

1:32:15.564 --> 1:32:17.465
Uh-uh.
You're not looking at him.

1:32:17.465 --> 1:32:18.601
I'm right here.

1:32:18.601 --> 1:32:19.735
You set?

1:32:19.735 --> 1:32:20.769
I'm set.

1:32:20.769 --> 1:32:21.837
Uhh.

1:32:27.175 --> 1:32:28.343
Gabe!

1:32:28.343 --> 1:32:30.178
- Gabe.
Hey, it's okay.

1:32:31.914 --> 1:32:32.915
We got this.

1:32:34.917 --> 1:32:35.918
Let's go.

1:32:38.587 --> 1:32:39.688
Give me your keys!

1:32:39.688 --> 1:32:40.956
In the car! In the car!

1:32:59.708 --> 1:33:01.977
<i>Where are these guys?</i>

1:33:04.312 --> 1:33:06.314
We got fucked here, man.

1:33:06.314 --> 1:33:07.650
What do you wanna do?

1:33:09.384 --> 1:33:10.819
Get Rader on the phone.

1:33:12.487 --> 1:33:14.990
Find out where the fuck
these guys are.

1:33:14.990 --> 1:33:16.058
Right now!

1:33:19.161 --> 1:33:20.796
<i>Stay with me.</i>

1:33:20.796 --> 1:33:22.898
Hey. Stay with me.
The hospital's right here.

1:33:22.898 --> 1:33:25.200
They're gonna be
looking for us there.

1:33:25.200 --> 1:33:27.035
It doesn't matter.

1:33:27.035 --> 1:33:29.037
We play this game
until we don't.

1:33:29.037 --> 1:33:31.239
Hey, we're past that.
You hear me?

1:33:31.239 --> 1:33:32.641
It's gonna be okay.

1:33:32.641 --> 1:33:34.376
Tell Camilla...

1:33:35.644 --> 1:33:36.879
And the kids that I love them.

1:33:36.879 --> 1:33:38.847
You're gonna tell 'em yourself.

1:33:40.448 --> 1:33:42.517
You had that baby boy, man.

1:33:44.186 --> 1:33:46.655
I don't want them to know.

1:33:46.655 --> 1:33:49.357
- I don't want them to know.
- Hey. Hey.

1:33:49.357 --> 1:33:50.625
We got this.

1:33:52.094 --> 1:33:54.029
Breathe. Just breathe.

1:33:54.029 --> 1:33:55.430
Hey, brother?

1:33:58.366 --> 1:33:59.567
Marcos?

1:34:02.304 --> 1:34:03.505
Mar--Marcos?

1:34:03.505 --> 1:34:05.107
Marcos!

1:34:05.107 --> 1:34:07.442
Hey! Hey! Hey.

1:34:07.442 --> 1:34:08.911
Hey.

1:34:14.382 --> 1:34:16.551
Fuck! Fuck!

1:36:00.388 --> 1:36:01.957
Gabriel?

1:36:01.957 --> 1:36:04.326
You look like you're coming out
of ether there.

1:36:04.326 --> 1:36:05.928
Where's Pike?

1:36:09.397 --> 1:36:11.033
You're an informant?

1:36:11.033 --> 1:36:13.301
Informant?

1:36:13.301 --> 1:36:14.669
What's this?

1:36:14.669 --> 1:36:17.072
- Where's my brother?
Brother?

1:36:18.773 --> 1:36:20.342
Calm as a motherfucking bitch.

1:36:36.024 --> 1:36:38.093
You fucked me, didn't you?

1:36:39.361 --> 1:36:40.863
Guess you won, huh.

1:36:42.230 --> 1:36:43.265
Man...

1:36:54.542 --> 1:36:57.145
I told you to stay away
from my brother.

1:37:00.082 --> 1:37:02.117
No, wait, wait.
Please, wait, wait.

1:37:03.385 --> 1:37:05.120
- Please.

1:37:15.130 --> 1:37:17.699
- Are you Agent Solomon?
Yes.

1:37:17.699 --> 1:37:19.667
He told me to give this to you.

1:37:20.568 --> 1:37:22.237
Who did?

1:37:22.237 --> 1:37:23.305
The robber.

1:37:37.619 --> 1:37:39.121
Found the escape vehicle.

1:37:39.121 --> 1:37:40.388
Torched.

1:37:40.388 --> 1:37:41.957
And Solomon,

1:37:41.957 --> 1:37:44.192
they said one of the robbers
was inside.

1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:47.762
And somebody
got to Rader.

1:37:47.762 --> 1:37:50.565
He's found shot dead
in his bar 15 minutes ago.

1:37:50.565 --> 1:37:52.234
Mmm.

1:37:52.234 --> 1:37:56.004
You sons of bitches
got some explaining to do.

1:37:56.004 --> 1:37:58.006
Sheriff, what are you--
What are you talking about?

1:37:58.006 --> 1:38:01.443
Any reason why the FBI
might be coordinating

1:38:01.443 --> 1:38:04.913
with local PD on a bank job
behind my back?

1:38:04.913 --> 1:38:07.682
- What bank?
- Frontier State Bank.

1:38:07.682 --> 1:38:10.018
You all got an Agent
on that deal.

1:38:10.885 --> 1:38:12.820
What is the hell
is Albright doing here?

1:38:15.657 --> 1:38:17.259
Hey.
Funny seeing you here.

1:38:17.259 --> 1:38:19.427
- I've been meaning to come--
Oh! My man! Yo!

1:38:19.427 --> 1:38:21.930
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm gonna give you some advice.

1:38:21.930 --> 1:38:25.133
Don't run an undercover bust
during my fucking investigation!

1:38:25.133 --> 1:38:26.301
Prick!

1:38:29.204 --> 1:38:30.238
You all right?

1:39:32.767 --> 1:39:34.169
How you doing?

1:39:34.169 --> 1:39:35.070
What can I get you?

1:39:36.871 --> 1:39:38.706
I'm three out there.

1:39:47.882 --> 1:39:49.117
I got this.

1:40:03.898 --> 1:40:05.100
Fuck!

1:41:13.535 --> 1:41:15.637
Hey. We're closed.

1:41:15.637 --> 1:41:18.840
Um, no, I'm actually
waiting on someone.

1:41:19.707 --> 1:41:20.975
There's nobody here.

1:41:23.345 --> 1:41:25.147
Okay. I'm sorry.

1:41:29.751 --> 1:41:31.052
Goodnight.
