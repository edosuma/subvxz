02:12.000 --> 02:13.900
Lydia! Kitty!

02:50.425 --> 02:53.125
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

02:53.425 --> 02:57.925
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you
not want to know who has taken it?

02:58.325 --> 03:04.025
As you wish to tell me, my dear,
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

03:10.025 --> 03:13.025
Kitty, what have I told you
about listening at the door?

03:13.425 --> 03:16.025
There's a Mr Bingley
arrived from the North.

03:16.325 --> 03:19.425
- Five thousand a year!
- Really?

03:19.825 --> 03:21.325
- He's single!
- Who's single?

03:21.525 --> 03:24.125
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

03:24.425 --> 03:26.125
How can that possibly affect them?

03:26.525 --> 03:28.525
Mr Bennet,
how can you be so tiresome?

03:28.825 --> 03:31.025
You know he must marry one of them.

03:31.325 --> 03:33.225
That is his design in settling here?

03:33.625 --> 03:35.725
You must go and visit him at once.

03:36.025 --> 03:38.825
Good heavens. People.

03:41.325 --> 03:45.225
For we may not visit if you do not,
as you well know, Mr Bennet.

03:45.625 --> 03:49.625
- Are you listening? You never listen.
- You must, Papa! At once!

03:50.025 --> 03:52.425
There's no need. I already have.

03:53.325 --> 03:55.125
- You have?
- When?

03:55.325 --> 03:58.825
Oh, Mr Bennet,
how can you tease me so?

03:59.225 --> 04:01.425
Have you no compassion
for my poor nerves?

04:01.825 --> 04:05.225
You mistake me, my dear.
I have the highest respect for them.

04:05.525 --> 04:08.625
They've been my constant companions
these twenty years.

04:09.025 --> 04:09.925
Papa!

04:10.125 --> 04:11.325
- Is he amiable?
- Who?

04:11.625 --> 04:13.925
- Is he handsome?
- He's sure to be.

04:14.225 --> 04:17.225
With 5,000 a year,
it would not matter if he had warts.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.825
Who's got warts?

04:19.125 --> 04:22.225
I will consent to
his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

04:22.525 --> 04:26.525
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?
- I believe so.

04:27.925 --> 04:31.625
- Mr Bennet!
- I have to have your muslin!

04:32.025 --> 04:34.725
- I'll lend you my green slippers!
- They were mine.

04:34.925 --> 04:38.525
- I'll do your mending for a week.
- I'll retrim your new bonnet.

04:38.925 --> 04:40.625
Two weeks I'll do it for.

05:19.025 --> 05:22.025
It's not the same!
It's not the same.

05:32.325 --> 05:34.225
I can't breathe.

05:37.125 --> 05:39.725
I think one of
my toes just came off.

05:47.925 --> 05:50.825
If every man does not end the evening
in love with you,

05:51.225 --> 05:52.925
then I'm no judge of beauty.

05:53.125 --> 05:56.025
- Or men.
- No, they are far too easy to judge.

05:56.325 --> 05:57.825
They're not all bad.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.725
Humourless poppycocks,
in my limited experience.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.325
One day,
someone will catch your eye,

06:03.625 --> 06:05.925
and then you'll have
to watch your tongue.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.325
How good of you to come.

06:28.625 --> 06:31.225
Which of the painted peacocks
is our Mr Bingley?

06:31.425 --> 06:34.025
He's on the right.
On the left is his sister.

06:34.325 --> 06:39.125
- The person with the quizzical brow?
- That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

06:39.625 --> 06:43.725
- He looks miserable, poor soul.
- He may be, but poor he is not.

06:44.125 --> 06:45.125
Tell me.

06:45.425 --> 06:48.025
10,000 a year,
and he owns half of Derbyshire.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.225
The miserable half.

07:17.725 --> 07:22.425
Mr Bennet, you must introduce him
to the girls immediately.

07:23.525 --> 07:25.225
Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

07:41.925 --> 07:42.825
Mary.

07:43.025 --> 07:45.825
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

07:47.125 --> 07:51.425
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet,
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

07:51.825 --> 07:55.325
It is a pleasure. I have two others,
but they're already dancing.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.025
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

07:58.325 --> 08:03.425
And may I introduce Mr Darcy
of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

08:23.225 --> 08:25.325
How do you like it
here in Hertfordshire?

08:25.625 --> 08:27.525
Very much.

08:27.825 --> 08:31.025
The library at Netherfield,
I've heard, is one of the finest.

08:31.225 --> 08:35.525
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good
reader. I prefer being out of doors.

08:35.924 --> 08:38.325
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

08:38.725 --> 08:41.924
And I'm not suggesting
you can't read out of doors.

08:42.325 --> 08:45.925
I wish I read more, but there
seem to be so many other things to do.

08:46.225 --> 08:48.325
That's exactly what I meant.

08:51.625 --> 08:55.325
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe
what we're about to tell you.

08:55.725 --> 08:58.225
- Tell me!
- She's going to take the veil.

08:58.525 --> 09:00.725
- The regiment are coming!
- Officers?

09:01.025 --> 09:04.125
They're going to be stationed
the whole winter, right here.

09:04.525 --> 09:06.925
- Officers?
- As far as the eye can see.

09:13.425 --> 09:17.225
Oh, look.
Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

09:17.525 --> 09:19.025
Mr Bennet.

09:33.325 --> 09:37.225
- Do you dance, Mr Darcy?
- Not if I can help it.

09:56.225 --> 09:59.225
I didn't know you were coming
to see me. What's the matter?

09:59.525 --> 10:04.925
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
are we not, Mr Darcy?

10:05.425 --> 10:07.525
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

10:07.825 --> 10:10.125
You were dancing
with the only handsome girl.

10:10.425 --> 10:13.325
She is the most beautiful creature
I have ever beheld.

10:13.625 --> 10:17.725
- But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.
- Perfectly tolerable.

10:18.125 --> 10:22.225
Not handsome enough to tempt me. Return
to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.925
You're wasting your time with me.

10:29.025 --> 10:33.325
Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he
liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

10:33.725 --> 10:34.925
Precisely.

10:35.225 --> 10:37.825
I wouldn't dance with him
for all of Derbyshire,

10:38.125 --> 10:40.325
let alone the miserable half.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.525
Wait!

12:01.525 --> 12:06.725
- I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.
- How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

12:07.225 --> 12:09.425
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

12:09.725 --> 12:12.425
My daughter Jane
is a splendid dancer, is she not?

12:12.725 --> 12:14.625
She is indeed.

12:15.625 --> 12:18.725
Your friend Miss Lucas
is a most amusing young woman.

12:19.025 --> 12:20.625
Oh, yes, I adore her.

12:20.925 --> 12:24.925
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.
- Mama!

12:25.225 --> 12:28.625
Oh, but Lizzie
would never admit that she's plain.

12:29.025 --> 12:33.025
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered
the beauty of the county.

12:33.325 --> 12:34.225
Mama, please!

12:34.625 --> 12:37.525
When she was 15, a gentleman
was so much in love with her,

12:37.825 --> 12:39.925
I was sure he would make her an offer.

12:40.225 --> 12:43.625
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

12:44.025 --> 12:45.125
And that put paid to it.

12:45.325 --> 12:48.625
I wonder who discovered the power
of poetry in driving away love.

12:49.025 --> 12:52.225
- I thought poetry was the food of love.
- Of a fine, stout love.

12:52.525 --> 12:55.825
But if it is only a vague inclination,
one poor sonnet will kill it.

12:56.225 --> 12:59.125
So, what do you recommend
to encourage affection?

13:00.125 --> 13:05.925
Dancing. Even if one's partner
is barely tolerable.

13:28.625 --> 13:31.925
Mr Bingley is just what
a young man ought to be.

13:32.225 --> 13:35.625
- Sensible, good-humoured...
- Handsome, conveniently rich...

13:35.925 --> 13:38.625
Marriage should not be driven
by thoughts of money.

13:38.925 --> 13:41.025
Only deep love
will persuade me to marry.

13:41.325 --> 13:45.825
- Which is why I'll end up an old maid.
- Do you really believe he liked me?

13:46.125 --> 13:49.525
He danced with you most of the night,
and stared at you the rest.

13:49.925 --> 13:52.725
I give you leave to like him.
You've liked many stupider.

13:53.025 --> 13:56.125
You're a great deal too apt
to like people in general.

13:56.425 --> 13:58.325
All the world
is good in your eyes.

13:58.625 --> 14:01.725
Not his friend. I still can't believe
what he said about you.

14:02.125 --> 14:04.425
Mr Darcy?

14:04.725 --> 14:09.225
I'd more easily forgive his vanity
had he not wounded mine.

14:09.625 --> 14:12.325
But no matter.
I doubt we shall ever speak again.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.025
He danced with Miss Lucas.

14:46.225 --> 14:48.025
We were all there, dear.

14:48.325 --> 14:50.325
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.225
There's a spinster
in the making and no mistake.

14:53.525 --> 14:56.125
The fourth with a Miss King
of little standing,

14:56.325 --> 14:58.325
and the fifth again with Jane.

14:58.725 --> 15:01.825
If he had any compassion,
he would've sprained his ankle.

15:02.025 --> 15:03.125
The way you carry on,

15:03.425 --> 15:06.425
you'd think our girls look forward
to a grand inheritance.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.825
When you die,
which may be very soon,

15:09.125 --> 15:13.425
they will be left without a roof over
their head nor a penny to their name.

15:13.825 --> 15:17.225
- Please, it's ten in the morning.
- A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.025
From Netherfield Hall.

15:21.325 --> 15:24.825
Praise the Lord. We are saved!

15:25.225 --> 15:29.925
Make haste, Jane,
make haste. Oh, happy day!

15:31.625 --> 15:34.025
It is from Caroline Bingley.

15:34.325 --> 15:38.825
She has invited me to dine with her.

15:39.225 --> 15:42.225
- Her brother will be dining out.
- Dining out?

15:42.525 --> 15:44.425
- Can I take the carriage?
- Let me see.

15:44.725 --> 15:48.225
- It is too far to walk.
- This is unaccountable of him.

15:48.525 --> 15:50.325
Mama, the carriage for Jane?

15:52.625 --> 15:56.025
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

15:56.925 --> 15:59.125
Horseback!

16:14.625 --> 16:16.325
Lizzie.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.825
Now she'll have to stay the night,
exactly as I predicted.

16:20.125 --> 16:23.125
Good grief, woman,
your skills in the art of matchmaking

16:23.525 --> 16:25.325
are positively occult.

16:25.425 --> 16:29.925
Though I don't think, Mama,
you can take credit for making it rain.

16:35.025 --> 16:38.325
"My friends will not hear of me
returning home until I am better.

16:38.725 --> 16:42.625
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and
a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

16:43.025 --> 16:47.925
If Jane does die it will be a comfort
to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.525
People do not die of colds.

16:50.825 --> 16:54.125
But she may perish with the
shame of having such a mother.

16:55.425 --> 16:58.025
I must go to Netherfield at once.

17:11.224 --> 17:16.025
Lady Bathurst is redecorating
her ballroom in the French style.

17:16.425 --> 17:19.425
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

17:22.125 --> 17:25.025
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.925
Good Lord, did you walk here?

17:41.825 --> 17:43.225
I did.

17:50.325 --> 17:54.425
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?
- She's upstairs.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.725
Thank you.

18:08.225 --> 18:12.925
My goodness, did you
see her hem? Six inches deep in mud.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.425
She looked positively mediaeval.

18:15.725 --> 18:20.125
I feel such a terrible imposition.
They're being so kind to me.

18:20.325 --> 18:25.725
I don't know who is more pleased at your
being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

18:31.125 --> 18:33.525
Thank you for tending
to my sister so diligently.

18:33.825 --> 18:36.025
She's in far better comfort
than at home.

18:36.325 --> 18:37.925
It's a pleasure.

18:38.225 --> 18:41.925
I mean, it's not a pleasure
that she's ill. Of course not.

18:42.225 --> 18:45.925
It's a pleasure that she's here,
being ill.

18:49.225 --> 18:51.425
Not going to be famous, our pig.

18:51.725 --> 18:54.925
Black on the back, but not related
to the learned pig of Norwich.

18:55.325 --> 18:58.225
- Now that pig is...
- Mr Bennet.

18:58.525 --> 19:01.725
It's all going to plan.
He's half in love with her already.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.225
- Who is, blossom?
- Mr Bingley.

19:04.525 --> 19:06.725
He doesn't mind
that she hasn't a penny.

19:07.025 --> 19:09.125
He has more than enough
for the two of them.

19:09.425 --> 19:11.325
- How will we meet them?
- Easy!

19:11.525 --> 19:12.525
Wait for me!

19:12.825 --> 19:18.025
You drop something. They
pick it up. And then you're introduced.

19:25.825 --> 19:26.825
Officers!

19:59.225 --> 20:02.425
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

20:02.725 --> 20:04.625
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

20:05.025 --> 20:08.425
How many letters you must have occasion
to write, Mr Darcy.

20:08.825 --> 20:11.525
Letters of business.
How odious I should think them.

20:11.825 --> 20:14.525
It is fortunate, then,
they fall to me and not you.

20:14.825 --> 20:17.225
Tell your sister I long to see her.

20:17.525 --> 20:20.725
- I've already told her once.
- I do dote on her.

20:21.125 --> 20:24.225
I was quite in raptures
at her beautiful design for a table.

20:24.525 --> 20:27.625
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures.

20:28.025 --> 20:30.025
I have not room enough
to do them justice.

20:30.325 --> 20:33.025
You young ladies are so accomplished.

20:33.325 --> 20:36.625
- What do you mean?
- You paint tables, play the piano

20:36.925 --> 20:38.225
and embroider cushions.

20:38.525 --> 20:41.525
I never heard of a lady,
but people say she's accomplished.

20:41.925 --> 20:44.025
The word is applied too liberally.

20:44.325 --> 20:46.325
I do not know more than
half a dozen women

20:46.625 --> 20:49.225
- that are truly accomplished.
- Nor I.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.625
Goodness, you must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

20:52.925 --> 20:54.525
- I do.
- Absolutely.

20:54.825 --> 20:58.325
She must have a knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing

20:58.625 --> 21:01.725
and the modern languages
to deserve the word.

21:02.225 --> 21:05.825
And something in her air
and manner of walking.

21:06.125 --> 21:08.925
And she must improve her mind
by extensive reading.

21:09.325 --> 21:12.825
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing
only six accomplished women.

21:13.125 --> 21:16.325
- I wonder at you knowing any.
- Are you so severe on your own sex?

21:16.725 --> 21:21.025
I never saw such a woman. She would
certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

21:23.525 --> 21:26.925
Miss Elizabeth,
let us take a turn about the room.

21:44.325 --> 21:48.825
It's refreshing, is it not,
after sitting so long in one attitude?

21:49.225 --> 21:52.325
It is a small kind of accomplishment,
I suppose.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.725
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

21:55.025 --> 21:58.425
You can only have two motives,
and I would interfere with either.

21:58.825 --> 22:00.725
What can he mean?

22:01.025 --> 22:04.125
The surest way to disappoint him
would be to ask him nothing.

22:04.425 --> 22:07.025
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

22:09.325 --> 22:11.425
Either you are
in each other's confidence

22:11.725 --> 22:13.725
and you have
secret affairs to discuss,

22:14.125 --> 22:16.225
or you are conscious
that your figures

22:16.525 --> 22:19.525
appear to the greatest
advantage by walking.

22:21.125 --> 22:23.825
If the first,
I should get in your way.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.825
If the second,
I can admire you much better from here.

22:27.225 --> 22:29.525
How shall we punish him
for such a speech?

22:29.825 --> 22:33.625
- We could laugh at him.
- No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

22:33.925 --> 22:38.425
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
you consider pride a fault or a virtue?

22:38.825 --> 22:41.625
- I couldn't say.
- We're trying to find a fault in you.

22:42.125 --> 22:45.025
I find it hard to forgive
the follies and vices of others,

22:45.325 --> 22:47.025
or their offences against me.

22:47.325 --> 22:50.625
My good opinion,
once lost, is lost forever.

22:52.725 --> 22:55.825
Oh, dear.
I cannot tease you about that.

22:56.025 --> 22:58.125
What a shame,
for I dearly love to laugh.

22:58.425 --> 23:00.525
A family trait, I think.

23:29.225 --> 23:34.425
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,
a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

23:34.825 --> 23:37.625
Are we to receive every
Bennet in the country?

23:40.525 --> 23:43.725
What an excellent room you have, sir.

23:44.025 --> 23:47.525
Such expensive furnishings.

23:47.925 --> 23:50.725
I do hope
you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

23:51.125 --> 23:55.625
Absolutely, I find the country
very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

23:56.025 --> 23:57.625
I find it perfectly adequate.

23:58.025 --> 24:00.725
Even if society
is a little less varied than in town.

24:01.025 --> 24:02.825
Less varied? Not at all.

24:03.125 --> 24:06.925
We dine with four and 20 families
of all shapes and sizes.

24:07.325 --> 24:11.625
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man.

24:11.925 --> 24:15.525
And a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

24:15.925 --> 24:19.425
Mr Bingley,
is it true you will hold a ball here?

24:19.825 --> 24:21.225
A ball?

24:21.425 --> 24:25.925
It would be an excellent way to meet new
friends. You could invite the militia.

24:26.325 --> 24:28.225
- Oh, do hold a ball!
- Kitty!

24:28.625 --> 24:31.225
When your sister recovers,
you shall name the day.

24:31.525 --> 24:35.825
I think a ball is an irrational way
to gain new acquaintance.

24:36.325 --> 24:40.225
It would be better if conversation,
not dancing, were the order of the day.

24:40.625 --> 24:44.525
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

24:44.925 --> 24:46.425
Thank you, Mary.

24:47.625 --> 24:51.725
What a fine imposing place to be sure,
is it not, my dears?

24:52.125 --> 24:55.325
There's no house
to equal it in the county.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.225
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

24:57.525 --> 25:00.225
- There she is.
- I don't know how to thank you.

25:00.525 --> 25:03.225
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

25:03.525 --> 25:06.625
Thank you for your stimulating company.
Most instructive.

25:06.825 --> 25:10.325
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

25:13.025 --> 25:14.925
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

25:27.425 --> 25:32.225
And then there was one
with great long lashes, like a cow.

25:32.725 --> 25:35.325
Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

25:35.625 --> 25:38.825
Just the one, mind.
We're not made of money.

25:41.425 --> 25:45.125
I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

25:45.625 --> 25:49.225
I've reason to expect
an addition to our family party.

25:49.525 --> 25:52.225
His name's Mr Collins,
the dreaded cousin.

25:52.525 --> 25:54.925
- Who is to inherit?
- Everything.

25:55.225 --> 25:57.925
Even my piano stool
belongs to Mr Collins.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.125
When?

25:59.325 --> 26:02.225
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

26:02.625 --> 26:05.725
The estate passes directly to him
and not to us poor females.

26:11.225 --> 26:13.325
Mr Collins, at your service.

26:22.925 --> 26:26.625
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent potatoes.

26:27.925 --> 26:31.825
It's many years since
I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

26:32.125 --> 26:36.225
To which fair cousin should I compliment
the excellence of the cooking?

26:36.725 --> 26:39.025
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

26:39.325 --> 26:41.125
Excellent.

26:41.425 --> 26:44.725
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

26:48.425 --> 26:51.725
I'm honoured to have as my patroness
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

26:51.925 --> 26:54.425
You've heard of her, I presume?

26:54.725 --> 26:58.525
My small rectory abuts her estate,

26:58.925 --> 27:01.525
Rosings Park,
and she often condescends

27:01.725 --> 27:07.325
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

27:07.725 --> 27:09.225
Does she have any family?

27:09.625 --> 27:13.825
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

27:14.225 --> 27:16.325
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

27:16.525 --> 27:19.525
that her daughter
seemed born to be a duchess,

27:19.825 --> 27:25.325
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

27:25.825 --> 27:29.425
These kind of compliments
are always acceptable to the ladies,

27:29.725 --> 27:33.825
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

27:34.225 --> 27:36.625
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

27:36.925 --> 27:40.325
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

27:42.625 --> 27:46.025
Do these attentions proceed
from the impulse of the moment

27:46.325 --> 27:48.625
or are they
the result of previous study?

27:48.925 --> 27:51.325
They arise
from what is passing at the time.

27:51.825 --> 27:55.925
And though I do sometimes amuse myself
with arranging such little compliments,

27:56.325 --> 27:59.725
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

28:00.125 --> 28:04.025
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

28:10.925 --> 28:14.225
After dinner, I thought
I might read to you for an hour or two.

28:14.625 --> 28:17.425
<i>I have with me Fordyce's Sermons</i>

28:17.725 --> 28:22.025
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

28:22.425 --> 28:26.625
<i>Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons,
Miss Bennet?</i>

28:31.825 --> 28:36.525
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the
good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

28:36.925 --> 28:39.225
a parsonage of no mean size.

28:39.525 --> 28:41.525
I have become aware of the fact.

28:41.825 --> 28:45.625
It is my avowed hope
that soon I may find a mistress for it.

28:46.025 --> 28:49.225
And I have to inform you
that the eldest Miss Bennet

28:49.525 --> 28:53.225
has captured my special attention.

28:53.625 --> 28:56.225
Oh, Mr Collins.

28:56.425 --> 29:00.425
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

29:00.825 --> 29:06.725
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
is very soon to be engaged.

29:07.125 --> 29:08.425
Engaged.

29:08.725 --> 29:11.025
But Miss Lizzie,
next to her in age and beauty,

29:11.325 --> 29:14.625
would make anyone an excellent partner.

29:15.025 --> 29:18.825
Do not you agree? Mr Collins?

29:19.125 --> 29:23.325
Indeed. Indeed.

29:23.725 --> 29:26.025
A very agreeable alternative.

29:48.225 --> 29:51.625
Mr Collins is a man who
makes you despair at the entire sex.

29:52.025 --> 29:56.125
- Yours, I believe.
- Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

29:56.525 --> 29:59.525
He picked up my handkerchief.
Did you drop yours on purpose?

29:59.825 --> 30:01.225
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

30:01.525 --> 30:04.225
- An enchanted lieutenant.
- What are you up to, Liddy?

30:04.425 --> 30:07.425
- We happened to be looking for ribbon.
- White, for the ball.

30:07.725 --> 30:10.125
Shall we all look
for some ribbon together?

30:13.425 --> 30:16.725
- Good afternoon, Mr James.
- Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

30:17.025 --> 30:18.425
I shan't even browse.

30:18.725 --> 30:21.325
I can't be trusted.
I have poor taste in ribbons.

30:21.625 --> 30:24.025
Only a truly confident man
would admit that.

30:24.325 --> 30:25.725
No, it's true.

30:26.025 --> 30:29.025
And buckles.
When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

30:29.325 --> 30:32.525
- You must be the shame of the regiment.
- The laughing stock.

30:33.025 --> 30:35.925
What do your superiors do with you?

30:37.425 --> 30:41.425
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

30:42.925 --> 30:45.925
- Lizzie, lend me some money.
- You already owe me a fortune.

30:46.925 --> 30:50.325
- Allow me to oblige.
- No, Mr Wickham, please...

30:55.925 --> 30:58.125
I insist.

31:01.425 --> 31:04.325
- I pity the French.
- So do I.

31:04.725 --> 31:07.325
- Look, Mr Bingley.
- Mr Bingley!

31:07.525 --> 31:09.625
I was just on my way to your house.

31:09.925 --> 31:12.925
How do you like
my ribbons for your ball?

31:13.225 --> 31:16.525
- Very beautiful.
- She is. Look, she's blooming.

31:16.725 --> 31:18.325
Oh, Lydia.

31:18.625 --> 31:22.025
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
He is a credit to his profession.

31:22.425 --> 31:25.625
You can't invite people
to other people's balls.

31:26.325 --> 31:28.425
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

31:28.625 --> 31:32.925
If you'll excuse me,
ladies, enjoy the day.

31:35.825 --> 31:38.925
Do you plan to go
to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?

31:39.325 --> 31:44.625
Perhaps. How long
has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

31:44.925 --> 31:46.725
About a month.

31:47.025 --> 31:52.325
Forgive me, but are you
acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

31:52.725 --> 31:56.825
Indeed, I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

31:57.225 --> 32:01.925
You may well be surprised,
given our cold greeting this afternoon.

32:04.925 --> 32:08.225
I hope your plans in favour
of Meryton will not be affected

32:08.625 --> 32:12.425
- by your relations with the gentleman.
- It is not for me to be driven away.

32:12.725 --> 32:17.525
If he wishes to avoid seeing me,
he must go, not I.

32:18.025 --> 32:22.425
I must ask, what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

32:25.825 --> 32:28.825
My father managed his estate.

32:29.125 --> 32:32.225
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

32:32.425 --> 32:38.225
His father treated me like a second son,
loved me like a son.

32:38.725 --> 32:41.025
We were both with him the day he died.

32:43.225 --> 32:45.025
With his last breath,

32:45.225 --> 32:48.325
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

32:48.625 --> 32:52.025
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the Church.

32:52.425 --> 32:55.625
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

32:55.925 --> 32:58.525
- But why?
- Jealousy.

33:00.725 --> 33:03.225
His father...

33:03.525 --> 33:06.425
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

33:07.725 --> 33:10.225
- How cruel.
- So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

33:10.525 --> 33:14.125
Too lowly even to be noticed.

33:25.825 --> 33:30.025
- Breathe in!
- I can't anymore. You're hurting.

33:33.625 --> 33:34.725
Betsy.

33:35.825 --> 33:37.325
Betsy!

33:48.925 --> 33:52.925
- There must've been a misunderstanding.
- Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

33:53.325 --> 33:56.725
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

33:57.025 --> 34:00.225
I will discover the truth
from Mr Bingley this evening.

34:00.625 --> 34:02.825
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.325
Till he does,
I hope never to encounter him.

34:05.525 --> 34:07.725
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

34:08.025 --> 34:10.125
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

34:10.324 --> 34:13.925
And, let us hope,
a rather more willing dancer.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.025
There they are, look.

34:21.324 --> 34:24.324
- Oh, yes.
- Billy.

34:30.125 --> 34:32.125
Jane Martin is here.

35:00.025 --> 35:03.425
May I say what an immense pleasure
it is to see you again.

35:03.925 --> 35:05.825
- Mrs Bennet.
- Miss Bingley.

35:06.025 --> 35:07.025
Charming.

35:09.925 --> 35:11.725
I'm so pleased you're here.

35:12.025 --> 35:14.125
So am I.

35:14.425 --> 35:19.225
And how are you? Miss Elizabeth?
Are you looking for someone?

35:19.625 --> 35:23.825
No, not at all, I was just admiring
the general splendour.

35:24.225 --> 35:27.825
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.
- Good.

35:35.925 --> 35:40.425
You might have passed
a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

35:40.825 --> 35:44.425
I've never met a
more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

35:44.725 --> 35:47.025
Did you see how he dotes on her?

35:47.325 --> 35:51.825
Dear Jane,
always doing what's best for her family.

36:09.525 --> 36:11.425
- Charlotte!
- Lizzie!

36:11.725 --> 36:16.325
- Have you seen Mr Wickham?
- No. Perhaps he's through here.

36:28.725 --> 36:32.825
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here.
Apparently, he's been detained.

36:33.325 --> 36:36.425
Detained where? He must be here.

36:36.825 --> 36:40.825
- There you are.
- Mr Collins.

36:41.125 --> 36:44.425
Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth.

36:44.825 --> 36:48.725
Oh, I did not think you danced,
Mr Collins.

36:49.125 --> 36:53.525
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman.

36:53.825 --> 36:57.125
Several people, her Ladyship
included, have complimented me

36:57.425 --> 37:00.925
on my lightness of foot.

37:25.725 --> 37:30.225
Apparently, your Mr Wickham has
been called on some business to town.

37:33.825 --> 37:37.625
Dancing is of little consequence
to me, but it does...

37:38.025 --> 37:41.425
...but it does afford
the opportunity to lavish...

37:45.525 --> 37:49.725
...upon one's partner attentions...
- My informer tells me...

37:50.125 --> 37:55.025
...that he would be less inclined
to be engaged, were it not for...

37:55.425 --> 37:57.525
...the presence
of a certain gentleman.

37:57.825 --> 37:59.725
Which is my primary object.

38:00.125 --> 38:02.725
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

38:03.025 --> 38:05.825
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

38:06.125 --> 38:08.525
to remain close to you
throughout the evening.

38:23.125 --> 38:25.325
May I have the next dance,
Miss Elizabeth?

38:25.725 --> 38:27.425
You may.

38:37.725 --> 38:41.625
- Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?
- I dare say you will find him amiable.

38:42.025 --> 38:46.825
It would be most inconvenient since I've
sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

39:02.025 --> 39:05.725
- I love this dance.
- Indeed. Most invigorating.

39:09.925 --> 39:12.325
It is your turn to say something,
Mr Darcy.

39:13.925 --> 39:15.325
I talked about the dance.

39:15.625 --> 39:20.325
Now you ought to remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples.

39:20.625 --> 39:24.525
I'm perfectly happy to oblige.
What would you like most to hear?

39:24.825 --> 39:27.025
That reply will do for present.

39:30.425 --> 39:32.525
Perhaps by and by I may observe

39:32.825 --> 39:35.825
that private balls
are much pleasanter than public ones.

39:38.525 --> 39:41.525
For now, we may remain silent.

39:49.325 --> 39:52.325
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

39:52.725 --> 39:56.425
No. No, I prefer to be
unsociable and taciturn.

40:00.525 --> 40:03.825
Makes it all so much more enjoyable,
don't you think?

40:06.325 --> 40:10.025
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?

40:12.925 --> 40:16.225
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

40:16.625 --> 40:19.425
It's a great opportunity
to meet new people.

40:21.425 --> 40:25.225
When you met us, we'd just had the
pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

40:27.225 --> 40:31.225
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy
manners, he's sure of making friends.

40:31.625 --> 40:34.225
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less so.

40:34.525 --> 40:40.025
He's been so unfortunate as to lose
your friendship. That is irreversible?

40:40.425 --> 40:44.325
- It is. Why do you ask such a question?
- To make out your character.

40:44.725 --> 40:47.125
- What have you discovered?
- Very little.

40:47.425 --> 40:50.825
I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.725
I hope to afford you more clarity
in the future.

41:41.525 --> 41:44.225
- Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?
- I believe so.

41:44.625 --> 41:46.325
I must make myself known to him.

41:46.525 --> 41:49.325
He's a nephew of my patroness,
Lady Catherine.

41:49.725 --> 41:52.525
He will consider it an impertinence.

41:52.825 --> 41:55.225
Mr Darcy.

41:55.525 --> 41:57.525
Mr Darcy.

41:58.625 --> 42:03.225
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

42:03.625 --> 42:06.425
What interesting relatives you have.

42:24.025 --> 42:27.725
Mary, dear,
you've delighted us long enough.

42:28.025 --> 42:31.225
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

42:34.425 --> 42:37.025
... since I was a child,
and then she died.

42:37.225 --> 42:38.925
I have a beautiful grey.

42:39.225 --> 42:42.825
Of course, Caroline's
a much better rider than I, of course.

42:47.025 --> 42:51.125
Oh, yes. We fully expect
a most advantageous marriage.

42:52.525 --> 42:56.425
And my Jane, marrying so grand,
must throw her sisters in the way.

43:18.825 --> 43:23.625
Clearly my family are seeing who can
expose themselves to the most ridicule.

43:24.025 --> 43:27.825
- At least Bingley has not noticed.
- No.

43:28.125 --> 43:31.525
- I think he likes her very much.
- But does she like him?

43:31.925 --> 43:35.825
Few of us are secure enough to be
in love without proper encouragement.

43:36.125 --> 43:38.325
Bingley likes her enormously,

43:38.725 --> 43:41.225
but might not do more
if she does not help him on.

43:41.625 --> 43:45.225
She's just shy. If he cannot
perceive her regard, he is a fool.

43:45.525 --> 43:47.825
We are all fools in love.

43:48.125 --> 43:51.025
He does not know
her character as we do.

43:51.425 --> 43:53.625
She should move fast
and snap him up.

43:53.925 --> 43:57.225
There is plenty of time
for us to get to know him afterwards.

43:58.625 --> 44:02.325
I can't help feeling
that someone's going to produce a piglet

44:02.625 --> 44:04.425
and make us chase it.

44:11.825 --> 44:14.925
- Oh, dear!
- I do apologise, sir.

44:15.225 --> 44:18.925
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

44:38.725 --> 44:40.825
Emily, please!

44:42.325 --> 44:46.625
Mary, my dear Mary.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

44:46.925 --> 44:50.025
- I've been practising all week.
- I know, my dear.

44:50.425 --> 44:52.625
I hate balls.

45:11.825 --> 45:13.925
Mr Bennet, wake up.

45:14.125 --> 45:18.625
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

45:21.225 --> 45:23.525
Charles, you cannot be serious.

45:30.725 --> 45:36.025
We'll have a wedding here in less than
three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

45:39.025 --> 45:40.525
Mr Bennet!

45:46.325 --> 45:48.925
Mary, please.

45:57.125 --> 45:59.325
Thank you, Mr Hill.

46:17.025 --> 46:20.025
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping,
if it would not trouble you,

46:20.425 --> 46:24.825
that I might solicit
a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

46:25.225 --> 46:30.725
Oh, certainly,
Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

46:31.025 --> 46:35.225
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like
a private audience with your sister.

46:35.625 --> 46:39.825
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing
to say to me that anybody need not hear.

46:40.225 --> 46:44.025
I desire you will stay where you are.
Everyone else to the drawing room.

46:44.325 --> 46:45.725
- Mr Bennet.
- But...

46:46.025 --> 46:48.325
Now.

46:49.325 --> 46:53.925
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!
- Jane.

46:56.925 --> 46:59.825
Papa, stay.

47:26.425 --> 47:28.025
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

47:28.325 --> 47:31.725
My attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

47:32.125 --> 47:34.425
Almost as soon
as I entered the house,

47:34.725 --> 47:39.625
I singled you out
as the companion of my future life.

47:40.025 --> 47:42.625
But before I am run away
with my feelings,

47:42.825 --> 47:45.425
perhaps I may state
my reasons for marrying.

47:45.825 --> 47:48.225
Firstly, that it is
the duty of a clergyman

47:48.425 --> 47:51.025
to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.

47:51.325 --> 47:55.125
Secondly, I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

47:55.525 --> 47:58.225
And thirdly,
that it is at the urging

47:58.525 --> 48:01.925
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine,

48:02.225 --> 48:04.525
that I select a wife.

48:04.825 --> 48:07.725
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

48:08.125 --> 48:10.125
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

48:10.325 --> 48:13.125
for I am to inherit the estate

48:13.425 --> 48:16.425
and such an alliance will surely...

48:17.825 --> 48:19.625
...suit everyone.

48:21.825 --> 48:26.125
And now nothing remains but for me to
assure you in the most animated language

48:26.525 --> 48:28.925
- of the violence of my affections.
- Mr Collins!

48:29.225 --> 48:31.325
And no reproach
on the subject of fortune

48:31.625 --> 48:36.025
- will cross my lips once we're married.
- You forget I have given no answer.

48:36.425 --> 48:39.825
Lady Catherine will
thoroughly approve when I speak to her

48:40.225 --> 48:45.125
of your modesty, economy
and other amiable qualities.

48:45.525 --> 48:50.025
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

48:51.325 --> 48:55.025
I know ladies
don't seek to seem too eager...

48:55.525 --> 48:59.025
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.
You could not make me happy.

48:59.325 --> 49:02.825
And I'm the last woman
in the world who could make you happy.

49:03.225 --> 49:07.525
I flatter myself that your refusal
is merely a natural delicacy.

49:07.925 --> 49:10.625
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

49:10.925 --> 49:15.025
it is by no means certain another offer
of marriage will ever be made to you.

49:15.425 --> 49:18.825
I must conclude that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense,

49:19.225 --> 49:23.425
according to the usual practice
of elegant females.

49:23.825 --> 49:27.225
I am not the sort of female
to torment a respectable man.

49:27.525 --> 49:29.925
Please understand me,
I cannot accept you.

49:37.325 --> 49:40.325
Headstrong, foolish child.

49:48.525 --> 49:54.125
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this
little hiccup dealt with immediately.

49:55.525 --> 49:58.925
Lizzie. Lizzie!

50:03.125 --> 50:07.225
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

50:07.725 --> 50:11.225
You must come
and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

50:11.425 --> 50:13.825
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

50:14.125 --> 50:17.525
but she vowed she will not have him,
and now the danger is

50:17.925 --> 50:20.625
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

50:20.925 --> 50:25.325
- What am I to do?
- Well, come and talk to her.

50:25.725 --> 50:26.825
Now!

50:39.625 --> 50:42.525
- Tell her you insist they marry.
- Papa, please.

50:42.825 --> 50:46.725
You will have this house
and save your sisters from destitution.

50:47.125 --> 50:49.925
- I can't marry him.
- Go and say you've changed your mind.

50:50.225 --> 50:52.625
- Think of your family.
- You cannot make me.

50:52.925 --> 50:55.325
Mr Bennet, say something.

50:59.425 --> 51:02.525
Your mother insists
upon you marrying Mr Collins.

51:02.925 --> 51:05.425
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

51:05.825 --> 51:09.625
From this day onward, you must be
a stranger to one of your parents.

51:09.925 --> 51:12.325
Who will maintain you
when your father is dead?

51:12.625 --> 51:16.225
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

51:16.625 --> 51:19.625
and I will never see you again
if you do.

51:19.925 --> 51:21.525
Thank you, Papa.

51:25.425 --> 51:29.825
Ungrateful child!
I shall never speak to you again.

51:30.225 --> 51:32.825
Not that I take
much pleasure in talking.

51:33.825 --> 51:36.525
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

51:36.725 --> 51:39.625
can have no pleasure
in talking to anybody.

51:40.025 --> 51:41.625
Jane!

51:45.025 --> 51:49.025
What's the matter? Jane?

52:43.725 --> 52:46.925
I don't understand
what would take him from Netherfield.

52:47.225 --> 52:49.425
Why does he not know when he'll return?

52:49.725 --> 52:50.825
Read it.

53:00.125 --> 53:04.525
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
and we are scarcely less eager.

53:04.925 --> 53:07.725
I do not think Georgiana Darcy
has her equal for beauty,

53:08.125 --> 53:11.825
elegance and accomplishment.
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

53:12.125 --> 53:14.725
Is that not clear enough?

53:14.925 --> 53:17.525
Caroline sees her brother
in love with you

53:17.925 --> 53:20.525
and has taken him off
to persuade him otherwise.

53:20.725 --> 53:25.525
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

53:25.925 --> 53:30.325
- It's more likely he does not love me.
- He loves you. Do not give up.

53:32.725 --> 53:34.725
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

53:35.025 --> 53:38.425
let it be known you are there
and I am sure he will come to you.

53:48.125 --> 53:52.625
Give my love to my sister
and try not to be a burden, dear.

53:52.925 --> 53:55.325
Poor Jane.

53:55.625 --> 53:59.825
Still, a girl likes to be
crossed in love now and then.

54:00.225 --> 54:02.125
It gives her something to think of

54:02.425 --> 54:05.425
and a sort of distinction
amongst her companions.

54:05.725 --> 54:09.425
- I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.
- It's your turn now, Lizzie.

54:09.825 --> 54:11.625
You've turned down Collins.

54:11.925 --> 54:16.025
You're free to go off
and be jilted yourself.

54:16.325 --> 54:18.125
What about Mr Wickham?

54:18.325 --> 54:21.025
He's a pleasant fellow
and he'd do the job credibly.

54:21.325 --> 54:24.825
- Father...
- And you have an affectionate mother

54:25.225 --> 54:28.625
who would make the most of it.

54:48.225 --> 54:50.325
- Charlotte!
- My dear Lizzie.

54:50.625 --> 54:55.825
I've come her to tell you the news.
Mr Collins and I are... engaged.

54:56.225 --> 54:58.425
- Engaged?
- Yes.

55:03.225 --> 55:07.825
- To be married?
- What other kind of engaged is there?

55:09.425 --> 55:12.625
For heaven's sake, Lizzie,
don't look at me like that.

55:13.025 --> 55:15.925
I should be
as happy with him as any other.

55:16.225 --> 55:18.825
- But he's ridiculous.
- Oh, hush.

55:19.125 --> 55:22.725
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

55:23.125 --> 55:26.725
I've been offered
a comfortable home and protection.

55:27.125 --> 55:28.725
There's a lot to be thankful for.

55:29.025 --> 55:34.125
I'm 27 years old.
I've no money and no prospects.

55:34.625 --> 55:38.025
I'm already a burden to my parents.

55:38.325 --> 55:40.725
And I'm frightened.

55:40.925 --> 55:45.325
So don’t judge me, Lizzie.
Don't you dare judge me.

56:38.125 --> 56:40.825
<i>Dear Charlotte,
thank you for your letter.</i>

56:42.225 --> 56:45.225
<i>I'm glad the house,
furniture and roads are to your taste,</i>

56:45.625 --> 56:48.825
<i>and that Lady Catherine's behaviour
is friendly and obliging.</i>

56:49.125 --> 56:51.725
<i>What with your departure,
Jane's to London</i>

56:51.925 --> 56:55.325
<i>and the militia to the North
with the colourful Mr Wickham,</i>

56:55.625 --> 56:59.425
<i>I must confess, the view
from where I sit has been rather grey.</i>

56:59.825 --> 57:02.625
<i>As for the favour you ask,
it is no favour at all.</i>

57:02.925 --> 57:06.825
<i>I would be happy to visit you
at your earliest convenience.</i>

57:13.725 --> 57:15.625
Welcome to our humble abode.

57:21.125 --> 57:24.725
My wife encourages me to spend time
in the garden for my health.

57:25.025 --> 57:27.325
I think our guest is tired
after her journey.

57:27.625 --> 57:32.025
I plan many improvements. I intend to
throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.

57:32.425 --> 57:35.225
I flatter myself
that any young lady would be happy

57:35.525 --> 57:38.425
to be the mistress of such a house.

57:39.725 --> 57:41.525
We shan't be disturbed here.

57:41.825 --> 57:45.525
This parlour is for
my own particular use.

57:48.325 --> 57:52.225
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure
to run my own home.

57:52.625 --> 57:55.525
- Charlotte, come here!
- What's happened?

57:55.925 --> 57:59.725
Has the pig escaped again?
Oh, it's Lady Catherine.

58:00.025 --> 58:02.425
Come and see, Lizzie.

58:02.725 --> 58:05.225
Great news.

58:05.425 --> 58:08.525
We received an invitation to Rosings
from Lady Catherine.

58:08.925 --> 58:10.425
How wonderful!

58:10.725 --> 58:13.525
Do not make yourself uneasy
about your apparel.

58:13.825 --> 58:16.025
Just put on the best you've brought.

58:16.325 --> 58:20.625
Lady Catherine's never been averse
to the truly humble.

58:21.625 --> 58:25.025
One of the most extraordinary
sights in all of Europe.

58:25.425 --> 58:28.725
The glazing alone
costs upwards of ?20,000.

58:29.025 --> 58:31.525
Come along. Come along.

58:40.425 --> 58:43.225
A little later we'll play cards.

58:44.325 --> 58:47.025
Your Ladyship.

58:47.425 --> 58:50.225
Miss de Bourgh.

59:08.725 --> 59:12.025
- So, you are Elizabeth Bennet?
- I am, your Ladyship.

59:15.925 --> 59:18.225
This is my daughter.

59:20.525 --> 59:24.825
- It's kind of you to ask us to dine.
- The rug alone cost upwards of ?300.

59:26.825 --> 59:28.925
Mr Darcy.

59:30.325 --> 59:32.325
What are you doing here?

59:34.525 --> 59:37.925
Mr Darcy,
I had no idea we had the honour.

59:39.825 --> 59:44.725
- Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here.
- You know my nephew?

59:46.625 --> 59:49.925
I had the pleasure
of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.

59:50.225 --> 59:52.825
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?

59:58.525 --> 01:00:04.225
Mr Collins, you can't sit
next to your wife. Move. Over there.

01:00:20.925 --> 01:00:24.425
Harvey, I wonder,
could you get me the fish course...

01:00:24.725 --> 01:00:28.625
I trust your family is in good health,
Miss Elizabeth?

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:30.825
They are, thank you.

01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:37.525
My eldest sister is in London.
Perhaps you saw her there.

01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:39.725
I haven't been fortunate enough...

01:00:40.025 --> 01:00:44.225
Do you play the pianoforte,
Miss Bennet?

01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:48.925
- A little, ma'am, and very poorly.
- Do you draw?

01:00:50.325 --> 01:00:52.325
No, not at all.

01:00:52.725 --> 01:00:54.825
Your sisters, do they draw?

01:00:55.025 --> 01:00:56.325
Not one.

01:00:56.625 --> 01:00:58.025
That's very strange.

01:00:58.225 --> 01:01:00.725
I suppose you had no opportunity.

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:04.725
Your mother should've taken you to town
for the benefit of the masters.

01:01:05.125 --> 01:01:09.025
My mother wouldn't have minded,
but my father hates town.

01:01:09.425 --> 01:01:12.725
- Has your governess left you?
- We never had a governess.

01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:18.325
No governess? Five daughters
brought up at home without a governess?

01:01:18.725 --> 01:01:22.625
I never heard such a thing. Your mother
must've been a slave to your education.

01:01:22.925 --> 01:01:24.825
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

01:01:29.925 --> 01:01:32.225
Your younger sisters,
are they out in society?

01:01:32.625 --> 01:01:34.625
- Yes, ma'am, all.
- All?

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:37.725
What, all five out at once?
That's very odd.

01:01:38.025 --> 01:01:41.625
And you second. The younger ones
out before the elders are married?

01:01:42.525 --> 01:01:45.325
Your youngest sisters
must be very young.

01:01:45.725 --> 01:01:47.325
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

01:01:48.325 --> 01:01:50.425
But it would be hard on younger sisters

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:54.125
not to have their amusement
because the elder is still unmarried.

01:01:54.425 --> 01:01:57.325
It would hardly encourage
sisterly affection.

01:01:57.725 --> 01:02:02.425
Upon my word, you give your opinion
very decidedly for so young a person.

01:02:02.825 --> 01:02:05.425
Pray, what is your age?

01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:09.425
With three younger sisters grown up,
you can hardly expect me to own to it.

01:02:19.825 --> 01:02:21.725
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

01:02:22.825 --> 01:02:26.225
- No, I beg you.
- For music is my delight.

01:02:26.425 --> 01:02:28.625
In fact,
there are few people in England

01:02:28.925 --> 01:02:32.625
who have more true enjoyment of music.

01:02:33.025 --> 01:02:34.525
Or better natural taste.

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:40.925
If I had ever learnt,
I should've been a great proficient.

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:45.325
So would Anne,
if her health would've allowed her.

01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:49.725
I'm not afflicted with false
modesty, when I say I play poorly...

01:02:50.025 --> 01:02:53.625
Come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:18.825
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:22.425
- She plays very well.
- I hope she practises.

01:03:22.725 --> 01:03:25.825
No excellence can be acquired
without constant practice.

01:03:26.125 --> 01:03:28.525
I've told Mrs Collins this.

01:03:28.825 --> 01:03:32.125
Though you have no instrument,
you're welcome to come to Rosings

01:03:32.325 --> 01:03:35.225
and play on the pianoforte
in the housekeeper's room.

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:39.325
You'll be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:51.525
You mean to frighten me
by coming in all your state to hear me.

01:03:51.925 --> 01:03:55.625
But I won't be alarmed,
even if your sister does play so well.

01:03:56.025 --> 01:03:59.825
I know that I cannot alarm you
even should I wish it.

01:04:00.225 --> 01:04:03.925
What was my friend like
in Hertfordshire?

01:04:04.225 --> 01:04:07.125
You really care to know?

01:04:07.525 --> 01:04:10.525
Prepare yourself
for something very dreadful.

01:04:10.925 --> 01:04:13.725
The first time I saw him,
he danced with nobody,

01:04:14.025 --> 01:04:15.525
though gentlemen were scarce

01:04:15.925 --> 01:04:18.525
and there was more than
one lady without a partner.

01:04:18.825 --> 01:04:22.325
- I knew nobody beyond my own party.
- Nobody can be introduced at a ball.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:25.325
Fitzwilliam, I need you.

01:04:36.425 --> 01:04:38.725
I do not have the talent

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:42.225
of conversing easily
with people I have never met before.

01:04:42.825 --> 01:04:46.325
Perhaps you should take
your aunt's advice and practise.

01:05:07.425 --> 01:05:10.125
<i>Dear Jane...</i>

01:05:22.325 --> 01:05:23.525
Mr Darcy.

01:05:31.525 --> 01:05:32.925
Please, do be seated.

01:05:39.025 --> 01:05:41.325
Mr and Mrs Collins
have gone to the village.

01:05:49.325 --> 01:05:51.225
This is a charming house.

01:05:51.425 --> 01:05:55.625
I believe my aunt did a great deal
to it when Mr Collins first arrived.

01:05:56.025 --> 01:05:58.325
I believe so.

01:05:59.725 --> 01:06:04.625
She could not have bestowed
her kindness on a more grateful subject.

01:06:13.225 --> 01:06:16.425
- Shall I call for some tea?
- No, thank you.

01:06:20.625 --> 01:06:23.325
Good day, Miss Elizabeth,
it's been a pleasure.

01:06:29.925 --> 01:06:33.325
What on earth have you done
to poor Mr Darcy?

01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:35.925
I have no idea.

01:06:37.225 --> 01:06:39.825
Every mind must have some counsellor

01:06:40.025 --> 01:06:43.525
to whom it may apply
for consolation in distress.

01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:48.525
There are many conveniences which
others can supply and we cannot procure.

01:06:48.925 --> 01:06:50.725
I have in view those objects

01:06:51.025 --> 01:06:53.925
which are only
to be obtained through intercourse...

01:06:56.425 --> 01:07:01.425
Forgive me, through the intercourse
of friendship or civility.

01:07:01.825 --> 01:07:07.325
On such occasions, the proud man steps
forth to meet you not with cordiality,

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:12.425
but with the suspicion of one
who reconnoitres an enemy...

01:07:12.825 --> 01:07:16.325
- How long do you plan to stay?
- As long as Darcy chooses.

01:07:16.525 --> 01:07:19.625
- I am at his disposal.
- Everyone appears to be.

01:07:20.025 --> 01:07:23.625
I wonder he does not marry and secure
a lasting convenience of that kind.

01:07:23.925 --> 01:07:27.525
- She would be a lucky woman.
- Really?

01:07:27.925 --> 01:07:30.925
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

01:07:31.225 --> 01:07:34.425
He recently came to the
rescue of one of his friends.

01:07:34.825 --> 01:07:36.225
What happened?

01:07:36.325 --> 01:07:38.425
He saved him
from an imprudent marriage.

01:07:38.725 --> 01:07:39.825
Who's the man?

01:07:45.525 --> 01:07:49.025
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

01:07:51.525 --> 01:07:54.425
Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

01:07:54.725 --> 01:07:57.825
There were apparently
strong objections to the lady.

01:07:58.125 --> 01:08:01.225
What kind of objections?
Her lack of fortune?

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:05.625
I think it was her family
that was considered unsuitable.

01:08:07.325 --> 01:08:11.825
- So he separated them?
- I believe so. I know nothing else.

01:08:42.325 --> 01:08:43.825
Miss Elizabeth.

01:08:44.125 --> 01:08:46.625
I have struggled in vain
and can bear it no longer.

01:08:46.925 --> 01:08:50.925
These past months have been a torment.
I came to Rosings only to see you.

01:08:51.225 --> 01:08:54.325
I have fought against
judgement, my family's expectation,

01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:57.325
the inferiority of your birth,
my rank.

01:08:57.725 --> 01:09:00.225
I will put them aside
and ask you to end my agony.

01:09:00.425 --> 01:09:03.524
- I don't understand.
- I love you.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.024
Most ardently.

01:09:11.125 --> 01:09:15.125
Please do me the honour
of accepting my hand.

01:09:16.625 --> 01:09:20.425
Sir, I appreciate the struggle
you have been through,

01:09:20.825 --> 01:09:23.225
and I am very sorry
to have caused you pain.

01:09:23.524 --> 01:09:25.524
It was unconsciously done.

01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:28.825
- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:28.925 --> 01:09:31.524
- Are you laughing at me?
- No.

01:09:31.925 --> 01:09:33.024
Are you rejecting me?

01:09:33.225 --> 01:09:38.524
I'm sure the feelings which hindered
your regard will help you overcome it.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.925
Might I ask why with so little civility
I am thus repulsed?

01:09:42.325 --> 01:09:47.325
I might enquire why you told me you
liked me against your better judgement?

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:49.925
If I was uncivil,
then that is some excuse.

01:09:50.225 --> 01:09:53.024
- But you know I have other reasons.
- What reasons?

01:09:53.325 --> 01:09:56.725
Do you think anything might tempt me
to accept the man who has ruined

01:09:57.125 --> 01:10:00.125
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

01:10:00.425 --> 01:10:04.925
Do you deny that you separated
a young couple who loved each other,

01:10:05.325 --> 01:10:07.525
exposing your friend
to censure for caprice

01:10:07.825 --> 01:10:10.525
and my sister to derision
for disappointed hopes,

01:10:10.925 --> 01:10:12.825
involving them both in acute misery?

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:16.325
- I do not deny it.
- How could you do it?

01:10:16.725 --> 01:10:19.425
I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

01:10:19.725 --> 01:10:22.325
I realised his attachment
was deeper than hers.

01:10:22.525 --> 01:10:23.525
She's shy!

01:10:23.825 --> 01:10:26.325
Bingley was persuaded
she didn't feel strongly.

01:10:26.625 --> 01:10:28.525
- You suggested it.
- For his own good.

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:31.525
My sister hardly shows
her true feelings to me.

01:10:35.925 --> 01:10:38.325
I suppose his fortune
had some bearing?

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:41.025
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.

01:10:41.325 --> 01:10:43.225
- It was suggested...
- What was?

01:10:43.525 --> 01:10:45.925
It was clear an advantageous marriage...

01:10:46.125 --> 01:10:48.425
- Did my sister give that impression?
- No!

01:10:48.725 --> 01:10:52.625
- No. There was, however, your family...
- Our want of connection?

01:10:53.025 --> 01:10:55.325
- No, it was more than that.
- How, sir?

01:10:55.725 --> 01:11:00.325
The lack of propriety shown by your
mother, younger sisters and your father.

01:11:03.925 --> 01:11:08.725
Forgive me. You and your sister
I must exclude from this.

01:11:13.425 --> 01:11:15.125
And what about Mr Wickham?

01:11:17.525 --> 01:11:18.425
Mr Wickham?

01:11:18.625 --> 01:11:21.325
What excuse can you
give for your behaviour?

01:11:21.525 --> 01:11:24.625
- You take an eager interest.
- He told me of his misfortunes.

01:11:25.025 --> 01:11:27.625
- Oh, they have been great.
- You ruin his chances

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:29.925
yet treat him with sarcasm.

01:11:30.225 --> 01:11:32.225
So this is your opinion of me?

01:11:32.525 --> 01:11:35.725
Thank you. Perhaps these offences
might have been overlooked

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:40.125
had not your pride been hurt
by my scruples about our relationship.

01:11:40.525 --> 01:11:43.625
I am to rejoice in the inferiority
of your circumstances?

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:46.525
And those are the words of a gentleman.

01:11:46.825 --> 01:11:51.325
Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish
disdain for the feelings of others

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:57.125
made me realise you were the last man
in the world I could ever marry.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:13.425
Forgive me, madam,
for taking up so much of your time.

01:14:17.825 --> 01:14:19.825
I came to leave you this.

01:14:30.325 --> 01:14:33.925
I shall not renew the sentiments
which were so disgusting to you.

01:14:34.225 --> 01:14:38.325
But if I may, I will address the
two offences you have laid against me.

01:14:45.125 --> 01:14:48.325
<i>My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.</i>

01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:52.225
<i>He left him a generous living.
But upon my father's death,</i>

01:14:52.625 --> 01:14:57.025
<i>Mr Wickham announced
he had no intention of taking orders.</i>

01:14:57.425 --> 01:15:02.925
<i>He demanded the value of the living,
which he'd gambled away within weeks.</i>

01:15:05.525 --> 01:15:08.525
<i>He then wrote,
demanding more money, which I refused.</i>

01:15:08.925 --> 01:15:11.825
<i>After which,
he severed all acquaintance.</i>

01:15:12.225 --> 01:15:16.325
<i>He came back to see us last summer, and
declared passionate love for my sister,</i>

01:15:16.725 --> 01:15:20.525
<i>whom he tried to persuade
to elope with him.</i>

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:24.225
<i>She is to inherit ?30,000.</i>

01:15:24.625 --> 01:15:29.825
<i>When it was made clear he would never
receive a penny of it, he disappeared.</i>

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:33.725
<i>I will not attempt to convey the depth
of Georgiana's despair.</i>

01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:37.025
<i>She was 15 years old.</i>

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:42.625
<i>As to the other matter,
of your sister and Mr Bingley,</i>

01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:46.425
<i>though the motives which governed me
may appear insufficient,</i>

01:15:46.725 --> 01:15:49.925
<i>they were in the service of a friend.</i>

01:15:50.325 --> 01:15:52.225
Lizzie.

01:15:55.525 --> 01:15:57.325
Are you all right?

01:15:57.625 --> 01:16:00.825
I hardly know.

01:16:09.025 --> 01:16:11.825
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.

01:16:12.325 --> 01:16:15.825
Your aunt and uncle are here
to deliver Jane from London.

01:16:16.025 --> 01:16:19.225
- How is Jane?
- She's in the drawing room.

01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:27.925
I'm quite over him. If he passed me
in the street, I'd hardly notice.

01:16:28.325 --> 01:16:32.025
London is so diverting. It's true.

01:16:33.925 --> 01:16:36.525
There's so much to entertain.

01:16:42.325 --> 01:16:44.225
What news from Kent?

01:16:46.225 --> 01:16:48.025
Nothing.

01:16:49.825 --> 01:16:51.925
At least not much to entertain.

01:16:52.225 --> 01:16:53.925
Lizzie, tell Mama!

01:16:54.225 --> 01:16:56.825
Stop making such a fuss.

01:16:57.125 --> 01:17:00.725
- Why didn't she ask me as well?
- Because I'm better company.

01:17:01.125 --> 01:17:03.625
- What's the matter?
- I've just as much right.

01:17:03.825 --> 01:17:05.925
Let's all go.

01:17:06.225 --> 01:17:09.025
Lydia's been invited to Brighton
with the Forsters.

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:11.325
Sea-bathing would set me up nicely.

01:17:11.525 --> 01:17:13.725
I shall dine with the officers
every night.

01:17:14.025 --> 01:17:15.925
Papa, don't let her go.

01:17:16.225 --> 01:17:20.725
Lydia will never be easy until she's
exposed herself in some public place.

01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:25.425
And we could never expect her
to do it with so little inconvenience.

01:17:25.825 --> 01:17:27.825
If you do not check her,

01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:32.625
she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt
who ever made her family ridiculous.

01:17:33.025 --> 01:17:34.725
And Kitty will follow, as always.

01:17:34.925 --> 01:17:39.625
Lizzie, we shall have no peace
until she goes.

01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:43.225
Is that really all you care about?

01:17:43.525 --> 01:17:46.925
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

01:17:47.425 --> 01:17:50.025
He will keep her
out of any real mischief.

01:17:50.325 --> 01:17:53.025
And she's too poor
to be an object of prey to anyone.

01:17:53.325 --> 01:17:54.425
It's dangerous.

01:17:54.725 --> 01:17:59.025
I am certain the officers will find
women better worth their while.

01:18:00.325 --> 01:18:04.025
Let us hope, in fact,
that her stay in Brighton

01:18:04.325 --> 01:18:08.925
will teach her her own insignificance.

01:18:09.425 --> 01:18:11.925
At any rate,
she can hardly grow any worse.

01:18:12.225 --> 01:18:16.525
If she does, we'd be obliged to
lock her up for the rest of her life.

01:18:25.925 --> 01:18:28.425
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.

01:18:28.725 --> 01:18:30.525
The Peak District is not Brighton.

01:18:30.925 --> 01:18:34.225
Officers are thin on the ground
which may influence your decision.

01:18:34.625 --> 01:18:38.525
Come to the Peak District with us,
Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

01:18:38.925 --> 01:18:42.325
The glories of nature. What are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

01:18:42.625 --> 01:18:45.725
Men are either eaten up
with arrogance or stupidity.

01:18:46.025 --> 01:18:49.225
If they are amiable,
they have no minds of their own.

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:52.625
Take care, my love.
That savours strongly of bitterness.

01:18:59.825 --> 01:19:03.825
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

01:19:04.225 --> 01:19:05.725
Why did you not tell me?

01:19:08.525 --> 01:19:10.825
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

01:19:13.125 --> 01:19:14.425
No.

01:19:18.925 --> 01:19:21.125
No, he did not.

01:20:25.025 --> 01:20:28.325
Oh, what are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

01:20:28.725 --> 01:20:32.025
Or carriages that work?

01:20:36.125 --> 01:20:38.525
Where exactly are we?

01:20:38.825 --> 01:20:41.125
Quite close to Pemberley.

01:20:42.925 --> 01:20:45.225
- Mr Darcy's home?
- That's the fellow.

01:20:45.625 --> 01:20:49.125
Very well-stocked lake.
I've a hankering to see it.

01:20:49.425 --> 01:20:50.425
Oh, no, let's not.

01:20:54.025 --> 01:20:56.125
Well, he's so...

01:20:56.425 --> 01:20:59.825
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...

01:21:00.225 --> 01:21:01.825
- So what?
- So rich.

01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:05.025
By heavens, Lizzie,
what a snob you are!

01:21:05.425 --> 01:21:09.025
Objecting to Mr Darcy because of his
wealth. The poor man can't help it.

01:21:09.325 --> 01:21:14.525
He won't be there anyway.
These great men are never at home.

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:20.425
Keep up.

01:22:40.925 --> 01:22:44.525
- Is your master much at home?
- Not as much as I would wish.

01:22:44.825 --> 01:22:47.225
He dearly loves it here.

01:22:47.425 --> 01:22:51.025
If he should marry,
you might see more of him.

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:02.525
He's a lot like his father.

01:23:07.225 --> 01:23:11.425
When my husband was ill,
Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

01:23:15.925 --> 01:23:19.825
He just organised the servants for me.

01:23:34.825 --> 01:23:38.325
This is he, Mr Darcy.

01:23:39.825 --> 01:23:41.825
A handsome face.

01:23:42.525 --> 01:23:46.125
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

01:23:46.525 --> 01:23:49.825
Does the young lady
know Mr Darcy?

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.325
Only a little.

01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:56.525
Do you not think him
a handsome man, miss?

01:23:56.925 --> 01:23:58.225
Yes.

01:24:00.925 --> 01:24:03.025
Yes, I dare say he is.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.425
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

01:24:10.025 --> 01:24:13.525
She sings and plays all day long.

01:24:15.925 --> 01:24:18.325
Is she at home?

01:26:24.125 --> 01:26:25.525
Miss Elizabeth.

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:41.325
- I thought you were in London.
- No.

01:26:41.625 --> 01:26:43.825
No, I'm not.

01:26:44.125 --> 01:26:45.725
No.

01:26:46.025 --> 01:26:49.225
- We would not have come...
- I came back a day early...

01:26:55.225 --> 01:26:56.525
I'm with my aunt and uncle.

01:26:59.325 --> 01:27:01.325
And are you having a pleasant trip?

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:03.925
Very pleasant.

01:27:04.325 --> 01:27:07.725
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock.
- Tomorrow?

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:12.725
- Are you staying at Lambton?
- Yes, at the Rose and Crown.

01:27:13.025 --> 01:27:15.025
Yes.

01:27:18.925 --> 01:27:20.425
I'm so sorry to intrude.

01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:24.525
They said the house was open
for visitors. I had no idea.

01:27:28.825 --> 01:27:31.025
- May I see you back to the village?
- No.

01:27:34.725 --> 01:27:37.025
- I'm very fond of walking.
- Yes.

01:27:39.325 --> 01:27:40.825
Yes, I know.

01:27:45.825 --> 01:27:48.025
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

01:28:05.925 --> 01:28:08.225
This way, sir.

01:28:14.325 --> 01:28:16.325
Are you sure you
wouldn't like to join us?

01:28:29.625 --> 01:28:32.925
We've just met Mr Darcy.
You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:37.725
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow.
He was very civil, was he not?

01:28:38.025 --> 01:28:40.525
- Very civil.
- Not at all how you'd painted him.

01:28:40.825 --> 01:28:42.025
To dine with him?

01:28:42.325 --> 01:28:46.525
There's something pleasant
about his mouth when he speaks.

01:28:46.925 --> 01:28:49.725
You don't mind delaying
our journey another day?

01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:53.425
He particularly wants you
to meet his sister.

01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:55.325
His sister.

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.925
Miss Elizabeth!

01:29:30.725 --> 01:29:32.525
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

01:29:32.925 --> 01:29:34.925
My brother has told me
so much about you,

01:29:35.125 --> 01:29:38.025
- I feel as if we are friends already.
- Thank you.

01:29:38.325 --> 01:29:41.525
- What a beautiful pianoforte.
- My brother gave it to me.

01:29:41.825 --> 01:29:43.725
- He shouldn't have.
- I should have.

01:29:44.025 --> 01:29:47.125
- Very well then.
- Easily persuaded, is she not?

01:29:48.425 --> 01:29:51.225
He once had to put up with my playing.

01:29:51.425 --> 01:29:55.925
- He says you play so well.
- Then he has perjured himself.

01:29:56.325 --> 01:29:59.325
- I said "quite well".
- "Quite well" is not "very well".

01:29:59.625 --> 01:30:01.225
I'm satisfied.

01:30:07.725 --> 01:30:10.425
- Mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing?
- Very much.

01:30:10.725 --> 01:30:13.425
Would you accompany me
to the lake this afternoon?

01:30:13.725 --> 01:30:16.125
Its occupants have been left
in peace too long.

01:30:16.425 --> 01:30:20.425
- I would be delighted.
- Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

01:30:20.825 --> 01:30:25.725
- Only when forced.
- Brother, you must force her.

01:30:26.225 --> 01:30:29.725
Splendid fishing, good
company. What a capital fellow.

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:33.025
Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

01:30:35.125 --> 01:30:37.125
A letter for you, madam.

01:30:37.425 --> 01:30:39.225
Oh, it's from Jane.

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:05.925
It is the most dreadful news.

01:31:08.425 --> 01:31:10.525
Lydia has run away...

01:31:13.525 --> 01:31:15.225
...with Mr Wickham.

01:31:15.525 --> 01:31:17.325
They are gone to Lord knows where.

01:31:17.525 --> 01:31:23.225
She has no money, no connections.
I fear she is lost forever.

01:31:27.025 --> 01:31:28.825
This is my fault.

01:31:29.125 --> 01:31:32.525
If only I had exposed Wickham
when I should.

01:31:32.825 --> 01:31:35.725
No, this is my fault.

01:31:36.025 --> 01:31:39.125
I might have prevented all this
by being open with my sisters.

01:31:40.325 --> 01:31:43.125
Has anything been done to recover her?

01:31:43.425 --> 01:31:48.325
My father has gone to London,
but I know nothing can be done.

01:31:50.525 --> 01:31:53.225
We have not the smallest hope.

01:31:53.525 --> 01:31:55.325
Would I could help you.

01:31:55.525 --> 01:31:57.625
Sir, I think it is too late.

01:32:01.525 --> 01:32:05.325
This is grave indeed.
I will leave you. Goodbye.

01:32:05.725 --> 01:32:07.525
We must go at once.

01:32:07.825 --> 01:32:11.425
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia
before she ruins the family.

01:32:39.225 --> 01:32:43.925
Why did the Forsters
let her out of their sight?

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:47.325
I always said they were unfit
to take charge of her.

01:32:47.625 --> 01:32:50.725
- And now she is ruined.
- You are all ruined.

01:32:51.125 --> 01:32:56.325
Who will take you now
with a fallen sister?

01:32:56.625 --> 01:33:00.025
Poor Mr Bennet will now have
to fight the perfidious Wickham

01:33:00.425 --> 01:33:01.925
and then be killed.

01:33:02.025 --> 01:33:03.825
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:06.825
Mr Collins will turn us out
before he is cold.

01:33:07.125 --> 01:33:10.825
Do not be so alarmed. Our uncle
is in London helping in the search.

01:33:11.225 --> 01:33:16.225
Lydia must know
what this must be doing to my nerves.

01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:21.625
Such flutterings
and spasms all over me!

01:33:23.725 --> 01:33:27.425
My baby Lydia, my baby!

01:33:27.825 --> 01:33:32.125
How could she do such a thing
to her poor mama?

01:33:33.425 --> 01:33:35.825
- You can't do that!
- Don't be such a baby.

01:33:36.125 --> 01:33:38.625
- Kitty, give it to me.
- Who's it for?

01:33:38.925 --> 01:33:40.425
It's addressed to Papa.

01:33:42.125 --> 01:33:44.025
It's in Uncle's writing.

01:33:44.525 --> 01:33:46.925
Papa, there's a letter.

01:33:47.225 --> 01:33:50.525
- Let me catch my breath.
- It's in Uncle's writing.

01:33:55.225 --> 01:33:57.325
- He's found them.
- Are they married?

01:33:57.525 --> 01:33:59.925
- I can't make out his script.
- Give it to me.

01:34:00.225 --> 01:34:01.425
Are they married?

01:34:01.725 --> 01:34:06.025
They will be if Father settles ?100
a year on her. That is his condition.

01:34:06.425 --> 01:34:09.125
- You will agree to this, Father?
- Of course.

01:34:09.425 --> 01:34:13.525
God knows how much your uncle
must've laid on that wretched man.

01:34:14.025 --> 01:34:15.125
What do you mean?

01:34:15.225 --> 01:34:17.025
No man would marry Lydia

01:34:17.325 --> 01:34:21.325
under so slight
a temptation as ?100 a year.

01:34:21.725 --> 01:34:24.325
Your uncle must've been very generous.

01:34:25.225 --> 01:34:27.525
Do you think it a large sum?

01:34:27.825 --> 01:34:30.825
Wickham's a fool if he
accepts less than ?10,000.

01:34:31.225 --> 01:34:33.925
- Heaven forbid!
- Father!

01:34:35.725 --> 01:34:39.925
Lydia married and at 15 too!

01:34:40.225 --> 01:34:42.025
Ring the bell, Kitty.

01:34:42.325 --> 01:34:46.625
I must put on my things and tell
Lady Lucas. Oh, to see her face.

01:34:47.025 --> 01:34:49.625
Tell the servants
they will have a bowl of punch.

01:34:49.925 --> 01:34:52.525
- We should thank our uncle.
- So he should help.

01:34:52.925 --> 01:34:56.325
He's far richer than us
and has no children. Daughter married!

01:34:56.525 --> 01:34:58.425
Is that really all you think about?

01:34:58.725 --> 01:35:02.425
When you have five daughters, tell me
what else will occupy your thoughts.

01:35:02.825 --> 01:35:04.525
Then perhaps you'll understand.

01:35:05.925 --> 01:35:08.625
You don't know what he's like.

01:35:09.825 --> 01:35:12.325
- Lydia!
- Oh, Mama!

01:35:16.525 --> 01:35:18.425
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

01:35:18.725 --> 01:35:22.325
So I took off my glove
so she might see the ring.

01:35:22.825 --> 01:35:25.525
Then I bowed and smiled
like anything...

01:35:25.825 --> 01:35:30.225
I'm sure she was not
half as radiant as you, my dear.

01:35:30.625 --> 01:35:32.625
You must all go to Brighton.

01:35:33.025 --> 01:35:36.425
That is the place to get husbands.
I hope you have half my good luck.

01:35:36.825 --> 01:35:38.225
Lydia.

01:35:38.425 --> 01:35:42.425
I want to hear
every little detail, Lydia, dear.

01:35:42.825 --> 01:35:45.625
I've been enlisted
in a regiment in the North of England.

01:35:45.925 --> 01:35:47.425
Glad to hear it.

01:35:47.725 --> 01:35:50.825
Near Newcastle.
We travel there next week.

01:35:51.125 --> 01:35:55.025
- Can I come and stay with you?
- That is out of the question.

01:35:55.325 --> 01:35:58.025
Monday morning came
and I was in such a fuss.

01:35:58.325 --> 01:35:59.425
I don't want to hear.

01:35:59.725 --> 01:36:03.125
There was my aunt preaching away
as if reading a sermon.

01:36:03.525 --> 01:36:07.025
- She was horrid unpleasant.
- Can't you understand why?

01:36:07.425 --> 01:36:11.425
But I didn't hear a word because
I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

01:36:11.825 --> 01:36:14.425
I longed to know if
he'd be married in his bluecoat.

01:36:14.625 --> 01:36:19.025
The North of England, I believe,
boasts some spectacular scenery.

01:36:19.325 --> 01:36:23.025
So I thought, who is to be
our best man if he doesn't come back?

01:36:23.425 --> 01:36:26.825
Lucky, he did,
or I would've had to ask Mr Darcy.

01:36:27.125 --> 01:36:31.325
- Mr Darcy!
- I forgot!

01:36:31.725 --> 01:36:34.925
- But I shouldn't have said a word.
- Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

01:36:35.325 --> 01:36:38.125
He was the one that discovered us.

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:43.025
He paid for the wedding,
Wickham's commission, everything.

01:36:43.425 --> 01:36:45.225
But he told me not to tell.

01:36:46.425 --> 01:36:48.725
- Mr Darcy?
- Stop it, Lizzie.

01:36:50.025 --> 01:36:53.925
Mr Darcy's not half as high and mighty
as you sometimes.

01:36:59.725 --> 01:37:02.725
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

01:37:03.025 --> 01:37:05.025
Write to me often, my dear.

01:37:05.325 --> 01:37:08.325
Married women
never have much time for writing.

01:37:08.525 --> 01:37:10.325
I dare say you won't.

01:37:10.625 --> 01:37:15.425
When I married your father, there didn't
seem to be enough hours in the day.

01:37:17.325 --> 01:37:22.025
My sisters may write to me,
for they'll have nothing else to do.

01:37:29.325 --> 01:37:33.225
There's nothing so bad
as parting with one's children.

01:37:34.425 --> 01:37:38.025
One seems so forlorn without them.

01:37:42.625 --> 01:37:47.525
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

01:37:49.425 --> 01:37:51.925
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

01:37:57.925 --> 01:38:00.925
I can't imagine what your
father does with all that ink.

01:38:01.325 --> 01:38:03.125
Mrs Bennet.

01:38:04.225 --> 01:38:08.725
Did you hear the news, madam?
Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

01:38:09.125 --> 01:38:13.125
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch
of pork. She expects him tomorrow.

01:38:13.425 --> 01:38:15.725
Tomorrow?

01:38:16.025 --> 01:38:18.425
Not that I care.
Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

01:38:18.825 --> 01:38:21.925
I'm sure I never want
to see him again, no.

01:38:22.125 --> 01:38:26.325
We shan't mention a word about it.
Is it quite certain he's coming?

01:38:26.725 --> 01:38:31.425
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone.
His sister remains in town.

01:38:33.625 --> 01:38:38.425
Why he thinks we should be interested,
I've no idea. Come along, girls.

01:38:39.525 --> 01:38:43.625
We better go home at once
and tell Mr Bennet.

01:38:44.025 --> 01:38:47.725
The impudence of the man.
I wonder he dare show his face.

01:38:48.125 --> 01:38:50.125
It's all right, Lizzie.

01:38:50.325 --> 01:38:53.225
I'm just glad he's alone
because we shall see less of him.

01:38:53.525 --> 01:38:57.625
Not that I'm afraid of myself.
But I dread other people's remarks.

01:38:58.025 --> 01:38:59.525
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:39:34.025 --> 01:39:36.225
He's here. He's here. He's at the door.

01:39:37.425 --> 01:39:40.325
- Mr Bingley!
- Mr Bingley?

01:39:40.625 --> 01:39:43.425
Oh, my goodness!
Everybody behave naturally.

01:39:43.925 --> 01:39:46.425
And whatever you do,
do not appear overbearing.

01:39:46.625 --> 01:39:50.125
There's someone with him.
Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.

01:39:50.425 --> 01:39:54.825
Mr Darcy? The insolence of
it. What does he think of, coming here?

01:39:55.225 --> 01:39:59.925
Keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away at
once. Find some useful employment.

01:40:01.525 --> 01:40:05.025
Oh, my Lord, I shall have a seizure,
I'm sure I shall.

01:40:05.425 --> 01:40:07.325
Kitty.

01:40:07.425 --> 01:40:11.525
- We can't have this here.
- Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.

01:40:13.325 --> 01:40:17.825
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

01:40:21.625 --> 01:40:25.925
Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

01:40:37.025 --> 01:40:39.625
How glad we are
to see you, Mr Bingley.

01:40:39.925 --> 01:40:42.425
There have been
many changes since you went away.

01:40:42.725 --> 01:40:47.425
Miss Lucas is married and settled.
And one of my own daughters too.

01:40:47.825 --> 01:40:49.625
You will have seen it in the papers,

01:40:49.925 --> 01:40:52.325
though it was not put in
as it ought to have been.

01:40:52.725 --> 01:40:56.225
Very short. Nothing about her family.

01:40:56.525 --> 01:40:59.225
Yes, I did hear of it.
I offer my congratulations.

01:40:59.525 --> 01:41:02.825
But it is very hard
to have my Lydia taken away from me.

01:41:03.125 --> 01:41:07.025
Mr Wickham has been transferred
to Newcastle, wherever that is.

01:41:07.325 --> 01:41:09.125
Will you stay long in the country?

01:41:09.425 --> 01:41:11.525
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

01:41:11.925 --> 01:41:13.825
When you've killed all your own birds,

01:41:14.125 --> 01:41:17.025
I beg you will come here
and shoot as many as you please.

01:41:17.325 --> 01:41:21.625
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige
and will save the best coveys for you.

01:41:22.125 --> 01:41:24.425
Excellent.

01:41:24.725 --> 01:41:28.425
- Are you well, Mr Darcy?
- Quite well, thank you.

01:41:28.825 --> 01:41:31.125
I hope the weather stays fine
for your sport.

01:41:31.325 --> 01:41:34.725
- I return to town tomorrow.
- So soon?

01:41:36.525 --> 01:41:40.825
My Jane looks well, does she not?

01:41:42.925 --> 01:41:44.925
She does indeed.

01:41:52.325 --> 01:41:55.025
Well, we must be going, I think.

01:41:55.925 --> 01:41:59.425
Darcy. It's been very pleasant
to see you all again.

01:41:59.725 --> 01:42:01.525
Miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.

01:42:01.925 --> 01:42:03.225
You must come again.

01:42:03.425 --> 01:42:06.825
Last winter, you promised to have
a family dinner with us.

01:42:07.125 --> 01:42:11.725
I've not forgot, you see.
At least three courses.

01:42:17.825 --> 01:42:19.425
Excuse me.

01:42:25.325 --> 01:42:28.025
Most extraordinary.

01:42:39.325 --> 01:42:42.525
We were going to walk in
and she was going to say, "Sit down."

01:42:42.825 --> 01:42:44.825
So, I feel...

01:42:55.325 --> 01:42:57.025
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

01:42:57.425 --> 01:42:59.225
It's been...

01:43:01.825 --> 01:43:03.825
- Miss Bennet.
- Mr Bingley.

01:43:04.125 --> 01:43:06.825
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.

01:43:07.125 --> 01:43:09.325
Yes, exactly.

01:43:14.125 --> 01:43:17.625
I'm glad that's over. Now we can
meet as indifferent acquaintances.

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:18.925
Oh, yes.

01:43:19.225 --> 01:43:22.125
You cannot think me so weak
as to be in danger now.

01:43:22.425 --> 01:43:26.125
You are in great danger of making
him as much in love with you as ever.

01:43:28.125 --> 01:43:32.525
- I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy.
- Don't say that.

01:43:34.025 --> 01:43:35.025
Why ever not?

01:43:37.925 --> 01:43:40.925
Jane.

01:43:41.225 --> 01:43:45.825
- I've been so blind.
- What do you mean?

01:43:46.225 --> 01:43:48.925
Look, it's him.
He's back. He's come again.

01:43:57.425 --> 01:43:59.325
I know this is all very untoward,

01:43:59.625 --> 01:44:03.625
but I would like to request the
privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.

01:44:04.925 --> 01:44:07.025
Alone.

01:44:08.725 --> 01:44:11.825
Everybody to the kitchen immediately.

01:44:12.125 --> 01:44:16.025
Except you, Jane, dear, of course.

01:44:18.125 --> 01:44:22.925
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good
to see you again so soon.

01:44:43.225 --> 01:44:47.825
First, I must tell you I've been the
most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

01:45:06.525 --> 01:45:07.925
Kitty, be quiet.

01:45:20.425 --> 01:45:22.825
Yes.

01:45:23.025 --> 01:45:25.225
A thousand times yes.

01:45:30.725 --> 01:45:34.025
Thank the Lord for that.
I thought it would never happen.

01:46:20.525 --> 01:46:24.625
I am confident
they will do well together.

01:46:25.025 --> 01:46:28.825
Their tempers are much alike.

01:46:30.125 --> 01:46:33.825
They will be cheated assiduously
by their servants.

01:46:34.325 --> 01:46:40.225
And be so generous with the rest,
they will always exceed their income.

01:46:40.725 --> 01:46:45.025
Exceed their income?
He has 5,000 a year.

01:46:49.125 --> 01:46:52.525
I knew she did not be
so beautiful for nothing.

01:47:01.025 --> 01:47:03.425
"...must be free from all insincerity.

01:47:03.725 --> 01:47:07.225
She only can address herself effectually
to the feelings of others

01:47:07.625 --> 01:47:10.725
whose mind glows
with the warmth of sensibility

01:47:11.025 --> 01:47:13.625
and whose arguments result
from conviction.

01:47:13.925 --> 01:47:17.225
She must feel the influence
of those passions and emotions

01:47:17.725 --> 01:47:20.725
which she wishes to inspire..."

01:47:41.525 --> 01:47:43.725
Can you die of happiness?

01:47:45.425 --> 01:47:48.325
He was ignorant
of my being in town in the spring.

01:47:48.625 --> 01:47:51.525
- How did he account for it?
- He thought me indifferent.

01:47:51.925 --> 01:47:55.525
- Unfathomable.
- No doubt poisoned by his sister.

01:47:55.825 --> 01:48:01.125
Bravo. That's the most
unforgiving speech you've ever made.

01:48:01.625 --> 01:48:03.725
Oh, Lizzie, if I could
but see you so happy.

01:48:04.025 --> 01:48:06.225
If there was such a man for you.

01:48:10.025 --> 01:48:13.125
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

01:48:16.125 --> 01:48:17.825
- What is that?
- What?

01:48:18.025 --> 01:48:21.025
Maybe he's changed his mind.

01:48:23.425 --> 01:48:25.425
Coming!

01:48:28.625 --> 01:48:29.925
Yes.

01:48:32.025 --> 01:48:33.925
Lady Catherine.

01:48:39.725 --> 01:48:42.525
The rest of your offspring, I presume?

01:48:42.825 --> 01:48:46.425
All but one. The youngest
has been lately married, your Ladyship.

01:48:46.725 --> 01:48:49.525
My eldest was proposed to
only this afternoon.

01:48:51.525 --> 01:48:55.425
- You have a very small garden.
- Could I offer you a cup of tea?

01:48:55.725 --> 01:48:59.025
Absolutely not. I need to speak
to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

01:49:00.025 --> 01:49:02.125
As a matter of urgency.

01:49:06.125 --> 01:49:09.325
You can be at no loss
to understand why I am here.

01:49:09.725 --> 01:49:11.925
I cannot account for this honour at all.

01:49:12.225 --> 01:49:16.225
I warn you, I am not to be trifled with.

01:49:16.525 --> 01:49:18.825
A most alarming report
has reached me.

01:49:19.025 --> 01:49:23.425
That you intend to be united
with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

01:49:23.825 --> 01:49:27.225
I know this to be a falsehood.
Though not wishing to injure him

01:49:27.625 --> 01:49:31.325
by supposing it possible, I instantly
set off to make my sentiments known.

01:49:31.725 --> 01:49:34.725
If you believed it impossible,
I wonder that you came so far.

01:49:35.025 --> 01:49:36.225
To hear it contradicted.

01:49:36.525 --> 01:49:39.825
Your coming will be a confirmation
if such a report exists.

01:49:40.125 --> 01:49:43.225
lf? You pretend to be ignorant of it?

01:49:43.525 --> 01:49:46.325
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourself?

01:49:46.725 --> 01:49:48.525
I have never heard of it.

01:49:48.825 --> 01:49:51.125
Can you declare
there is no foundation for it?

01:49:51.425 --> 01:49:54.725
I do not pretend to possess
equal frankness with your Ladyship.

01:49:55.025 --> 01:49:58.025
You may ask a question
which I may choose not to answer.

01:49:58.425 --> 01:50:00.625
Has my nephew
made you an offer of marriage?

01:50:00.725 --> 01:50:03.725
Your Ladyship has declared it
to be impossible.

01:50:04.125 --> 01:50:07.525
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
Now what have you to say?

01:50:07.825 --> 01:50:11.325
If that is the case, you cannot suppose
he would make an offer to me.

01:50:11.725 --> 01:50:16.625
Selfish girl. This union
has been planned since their infancy.

01:50:17.025 --> 01:50:20.225
Do you think it can be prevented
by a woman of inferior birth

01:50:20.625 --> 01:50:24.925
whose own sister's elopement resulted
in a scandalously patched-up marriage

01:50:25.325 --> 01:50:28.425
only achieved
at the expense of your uncle.

01:50:28.725 --> 01:50:32.425
Heaven and Earth! Are the shades
of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

01:50:32.825 --> 01:50:35.225
Tell me once and for all,
are you engaged to him?

01:50:38.825 --> 01:50:40.925
I am not.

01:50:41.825 --> 01:50:44.725
Will you promise never
to enter into such an engagement?

01:50:45.025 --> 01:50:47.125
I will not and I certainly never shall.

01:50:49.125 --> 01:50:51.225
You have insulted me
in every possible way

01:50:51.625 --> 01:50:54.225
and can now have
nothing further to say.

01:50:55.625 --> 01:50:58.225
I must ask you to leave immediately.

01:51:00.625 --> 01:51:01.925
Goodnight.

01:51:03.925 --> 01:51:07.525
I have never been thus treated
in my entire life!

01:51:08.925 --> 01:51:12.225
- What is going on?
- Just a small misunderstanding.

01:51:12.625 --> 01:51:15.725
For once in your life,
leave me alone!

01:54:05.425 --> 01:54:08.125
- I couldn't sleep.
- Nor I. My aunt...

01:54:08.425 --> 01:54:11.425
Yes, she was here.

01:54:11.725 --> 01:54:14.725
How can I ever make amends
for such behaviour?

01:54:15.125 --> 01:54:17.425
After what you've done for Lydia

01:54:17.725 --> 01:54:20.825
and, I suspect, for Jane,
it is I who should be making amends.

01:54:22.325 --> 01:54:26.925
You must know.
Surely you must know it was all for you.

01:54:29.625 --> 01:54:32.625
You are too generous to trifle with me.

01:54:32.925 --> 01:54:36.225
You spoke with my aunt last night
and it has taught me to hope

01:54:36.425 --> 01:54:39.025
as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.

01:54:40.625 --> 01:54:45.525
If your feelings are still what they
were last April, tell me so at once.

01:54:45.825 --> 01:54:48.725
My affections and wishes
have not changed.

01:54:49.125 --> 01:54:52.125
But one word from you
will silence me for ever.

01:54:57.525 --> 01:55:01.625
lf, however,
your feelings have changed...

01:55:04.625 --> 01:55:06.725
...I would have to tell you,

01:55:07.025 --> 01:55:09.725
you have bewitched me,
body and soul, and I love...

01:55:10.025 --> 01:55:12.925
I love... I love you.

01:55:13.225 --> 01:55:16.025
I never wish to be parted
from you from this day on.

01:55:27.825 --> 01:55:29.425
Well, then.

01:55:34.525 --> 01:55:37.025
Your hands are cold.

01:56:21.525 --> 01:56:23.325
Shut the door, please.

01:56:34.425 --> 01:56:39.725
Lizzie, are you out of your senses?
I thought you hated the man.

01:56:40.125 --> 01:56:44.925
- No, Papa.
- He is rich, to be sure.

01:56:45.325 --> 01:56:49.025
And you will have
more fine carriages than Jane.

01:56:49.325 --> 01:56:51.725
But will that make you happy?

01:56:52.025 --> 01:56:55.925
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

01:56:56.325 --> 01:56:58.425
None at all.

01:56:58.725 --> 01:57:03.325
We all know him to be
a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.

01:57:03.725 --> 01:57:06.025
But this would be nothing
if you liked him.

01:57:06.325 --> 01:57:07.925
I do like him.

01:57:10.325 --> 01:57:11.825
I love him.

01:57:15.025 --> 01:57:19.525
He's not proud. I was wrong.
I was entirely wrong about him.

01:57:23.225 --> 01:57:26.425
You don't know him, Papa.
If I told you what he was really like,

01:57:26.725 --> 01:57:27.825
what he's done...

01:57:28.925 --> 01:57:30.825
What has he done?

01:57:39.025 --> 01:57:42.625
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

01:57:43.025 --> 01:57:46.525
So did I. So did we all.

01:57:46.825 --> 01:57:49.325
We must have been wrong.

01:57:49.725 --> 01:57:55.025
- It won't be the first time, will it?
- No, nor the last, I dare say.

01:58:00.725 --> 01:58:02.425
Good Lord.

01:58:05.225 --> 01:58:09.025
- I must pay him back.
- No.

01:58:09.425 --> 01:58:12.825
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

01:58:13.125 --> 01:58:17.225
We misjudged him, Papa.
Me more than anyone. In every way.

01:58:17.725 --> 01:58:20.825
Not just in this matter.

01:58:21.125 --> 01:58:23.725
I've been nonsensical.

01:58:24.025 --> 01:58:28.825
But he's been a fool about Jane,
about so many other things.

01:58:29.225 --> 01:58:32.525
But then, so have I.

01:58:35.525 --> 01:58:38.125
You see, he and I are...

01:58:40.525 --> 01:58:43.525
He and I are so similar.

01:58:43.925 --> 01:58:47.125
We're both so stubborn.

01:58:48.925 --> 01:58:50.525
Papa, I...

01:58:54.625 --> 01:58:56.825
You really do love him, don't you?

01:58:58.425 --> 01:59:00.625
Very much.

01:59:05.125 --> 01:59:10.625
I cannot believe
that anyone can deserve you.

01:59:11.125 --> 01:59:15.125
But it seems I am overruled.

01:59:15.525 --> 01:59:19.925
So I heartily give my consent.

01:59:28.425 --> 01:59:33.125
I could not have parted with you,
my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.

01:59:36.625 --> 01:59:37.625
Thank you.

01:59:51.725 --> 01:59:56.125
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,
for heaven's sake, send them in.

01:59:56.625 --> 01:59:59.025
I'm quite at my leisure.

02:00:21.015 --> 02:00:22.700
How are you this
evening, my dear?

02:00:22.917 --> 02:00:24.240
Very well.

02:00:24.285 --> 02:00:25.800
Only I wish you would not
call me 'my dear.'

02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:26.900
Why?

02:00:26.988 --> 02:00:28.950
'Cause it's what my father
always calls my mother

02:00:29.056 --> 02:00:30.400
when he's cross
about something.

02:00:30.491 --> 02:00:31.850
What endearments
am I allowed?

02:00:31.959 --> 02:00:33.403
Well, let me think.

02:00:33.628 --> 02:00:35.266
Lizzie, for everyday.

02:00:35.997 --> 02:00:38.477
My pearl, for Sundays.

02:00:39.333 --> 02:00:42.473
And Goddess Divine, but only on very
special occasions.

02:00:43.938 --> 02:00:46.975
And what shall I call you
when I'm cross?

02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:49.302
Mrs. Darcy?

02:00:49.744 --> 02:00:51.951
No. No.

02:00:53.014 --> 02:00:55.118
You may only call me
Mrs. Darcy

02:00:56.150 --> 02:00:58.152
when you are completely

02:00:58.352 --> 02:01:01.458
and perfectly,
and incandescently happy.

02:01:04.992 --> 02:01:08.803
And how are you this evening,
Mrs. Darcy?

02:01:18.206 --> 02:01:19.650
Mrs. Darcy.

02:01:22.843 --> 02:01:24.447
Mrs. Darcy.

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:27.754
Mrs. Darcy.

02:01:33.554 --> 02:01:34.725
Mrs. Darcy.
