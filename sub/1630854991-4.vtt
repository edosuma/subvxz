00:01.700 --> 00:02.900
How much is all that?

00:03.020 --> 00:04.500
20 million.

00:04.660 --> 00:06.660
Frank said you might be
interested in a purchase?

00:06.820 --> 00:07.940
All depends
on the price.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.940
I was thinking closer
to 25 a kilo.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.020
At that price,
we'd be working for you.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.820
Bren:
Selling product at a loss

00:14.020 --> 00:17.340
makes this family look
like a fucking joke.

00:17.540 --> 00:18.860
Jimmy?
He's with us.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.100
You need to start acting
like the man in this house.

00:22.300 --> 00:25.500
This is for you
for all the birthdays I missed.

00:25.660 --> 00:28.820
I said stay the fuck away
from Anna!

00:29.060 --> 00:30.380
I'm not gonna
ask you again.

00:30.660 --> 00:31.460
Fuck.
Bang

00:31.580 --> 00:32.660
He's trapped.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.380
Hooting

00:34.620 --> 00:36.900
Do it!
Gunshot

00:37.100 --> 00:39.140
Breslin: When we were going
through Donovan's belongings,

00:39.260 --> 00:40.300
we found this.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.340
Could be a bank account
or something.

00:42.540 --> 00:45.220
The original has Amanda
Kinsella's fingerprints on it.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.060
Listen, Da...
Kem's a rat.

00:48.260 --> 00:50.300
What do you mean
he's a fucking rat?

00:50.500 --> 00:52.460
He was feeding information
to Eamon Cunningham.

00:52.660 --> 00:54.460
Viking: What the fuck
are you talking about?

00:54.660 --> 00:56.820
You brought him
into this family, Eric.

00:57.020 --> 00:58.300
You're gonna have to
clear this mess up.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.500
Bren...

00:59.660 --> 01:01.380
I can either trust you
or I can't.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.700
Yeah.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.460
Yeah?

01:29.660 --> 01:31.660
He'll be down
in five minutes.

01:31.820 --> 01:33.300
Five?

Sorry about the wait,
buddy.

Good night?

Michael!

Knocking continues

02:11.220 --> 02:14.500
Michael:
Ah, fuck's sake.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.620
What the fuck's going on?
What time is it?

02:16.740 --> 02:19.420
Something wrong?

02:19.620 --> 02:22.060
Come here, bro.
Bring it in.

02:22.220 --> 02:23.860
Oh...

02:24.020 --> 02:25.620
Mm.

02:29.420 --> 02:32.460
You got anything
to drink in here?

02:32.580 --> 02:34.220
No, I do not.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.140
Why the fuck not?

02:38.140 --> 02:40.380
Guess what I did tonight.

02:40.540 --> 02:41.980
Got drunk?

02:42.180 --> 02:43.980
Laughing Yes!

02:44.140 --> 02:45.380
But after that.

02:45.580 --> 02:46.980
Jimmy, it's really
late, uh...

02:47.140 --> 02:49.660
I got me hole.

02:49.860 --> 02:52.340
Laughs

02:52.500 --> 02:55.340
Oh, man, fuck me.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.180
When you're with someone
for so long,

02:57.420 --> 03:00.180
you almost forget what it's like
to sleep with someone new.

03:00.380 --> 03:04.540
It's... not too bad.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.420
Why you telling me this?

03:06.580 --> 03:07.740
Eh.

03:07.860 --> 03:10.100
You're my brother.

03:10.260 --> 03:13.500
And I trust you
with a secret.

03:13.660 --> 03:16.740
And I figure
that if anybody --

03:16.940 --> 03:19.980
anybody understands
the buzz of...

03:20.180 --> 03:23.060
fucking somebody they shouldn't,
well, that would be you.

03:23.180 --> 03:25.420
Wouldn't it, Michael?

03:25.580 --> 03:27.820
You should go now.

03:28.020 --> 03:30.300
Why don't you ever want
to fuck anybody, Michael?

03:30.500 --> 03:32.100
I mean,
what's that all about?

03:32.220 --> 03:33.220
Eh?

03:33.420 --> 03:35.820
Who are you saving
yourself for?

03:35.980 --> 03:37.620
Huh?

03:37.820 --> 03:40.020
I'm not gonna ask you
to leave again.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.700
Whoa.

further interest rate increases

04:42.380 --> 04:44.500
Gardaí have confirmed
that the man killed

04:44.700 --> 04:47.660
in last night's shooting
at a Dublin pub died

04:47.780 --> 04:49.780

a close associate
of Gerard Delaney,

who was recently shot
in a gangland assassination.

Yeah?
It's all done.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.860

Who was at the farm house?

05:10.980 --> 05:12.860
Just Lee.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.460
Did he mention Bren?
No.

05:14.660 --> 05:16.020
Told him you said
I was to collect the gear,

05:16.180 --> 05:17.620
and he was grand with that.

05:17.860 --> 05:18.860
Exhales
Okay.

05:19.020 --> 05:20.380
Hey, that thing at the pub
last night,

05:20.540 --> 05:21.900
did you hear
anything about it?

05:22.100 --> 05:24.500
Just that it was Kev Delaney
looking for Eric and Bren.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.900
Jesus Christ, this shit
with Bren never ends.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.540
I know.
I'm leaving now.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.540
Okay.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.300

06:08.780 --> 06:10.660
my cousin's boy.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.500
Rory told you
what I need you to do?

06:12.660 --> 06:14.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's no bother.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.940
You know where you're going?
Yeah.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.020
There's a thousand in it for you
when it's done.

06:18.220 --> 06:20.620
Sweet.
Well, get going, then.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.540
Are you sure he's not
involved in nothing?

06:24.700 --> 06:26.900
He's a student.
No one knows him.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.140
No one's gonna pay

06:59.140 --> 07:00.740
You know about
Fenethylline?

07:00.860 --> 07:01.940
Should I?

07:02.140 --> 07:03.340
It's an amphetamine.

07:03.540 --> 07:05.740
They make it in the factories
in Syria.

07:05.940 --> 07:08.740
It was for the soldiers
before they go into battle...

07:08.940 --> 07:11.340
make them feel
invincible.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.540
Now, it's mostly
for export.

07:13.740 --> 07:16.540
It's very good.
Very popular.

07:16.660 --> 07:17.980
How much?

07:18.140 --> 07:20.540
You buy from me for 2 euros,
you sell for 10.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.340
Make a lot of money.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.380
And I can get as much of it
as you want.

07:25.580 --> 07:27.020
Let me have a think
about it.

Did something happen?

08:05.620 --> 08:08.020
You tell her, Frank.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.700
Go on.

08:10.860 --> 08:14.500
Apparently, Kem was
ratting us out to Eamon.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.500
He set up Fudge.

08:16.740 --> 08:19.220

Where'd you hear that?

08:19.380 --> 08:20.900
From Jimmy.

08:21.020 --> 08:23.340
Amanda found out months ago.

08:23.540 --> 08:26.940
And she told him and Michael
not to tell anyone else.

08:27.100 --> 08:30.540
So we've a fucking rat
working for this family,

08:30.740 --> 08:33.620
and she didn't see fit
to tell us.

08:33.820 --> 08:37.340
For all we know, he could be
fucking touting to the guards.

08:37.540 --> 08:40.580
She's putting this whole family
at risk.

08:40.780 --> 08:43.580
Is that any way
to run things?

08:43.780 --> 08:45.140
No.
No.

08:45.340 --> 08:48.180
Well, tell that to this
fucking clown here --

08:48.420 --> 08:50.900
siding with her and Michael
against the rest of us.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.340
I'm not siding
with anyone...

08:52.540 --> 08:55.380
That's exactly what
you're fucking doing.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.740
She's got us all for mugs.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.740
'Cause she thinks she's smarter
than the rest of us.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.660
Well, I'm not having it.

09:02.860 --> 09:05.940
And in future, you stick
with me and Birdy.

09:06.140 --> 09:08.740
Amanda's not fit to be
making decisions.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.300
I'll do what I think
is right.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.220
You'll do what I fucking
tell you to do.

09:12.420 --> 09:13.940
Otherwise,
I'll fucking bury you.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.300
Birdy:
Now, Bren, stop it.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.900
Is that clear, Frank?

09:17.060 --> 09:21.060
##

09:21.220 --> 09:22.300
Yeah.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.900
It fucking better be.

09:24.100 --> 09:32.140
##

09:32.260 --> 09:33.820
Eric, Kem's our friend.

09:33.980 --> 09:35.820
It doesn't matter.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.420
Not if he's a rat.

09:37.580 --> 09:39.620
I don't care if he is.
He got you out.

09:39.820 --> 09:41.620
Can't you just threaten him?
Tell him to leave Dublin.

09:41.780 --> 09:42.820
That's a punishment.

09:43.020 --> 09:45.140
This has already
been decided.

09:45.340 --> 09:47.020
Bren's not gonna
change his mind.

09:49.140 --> 09:50.540
But why does it have
to be you?

09:50.700 --> 09:52.500
'Cause it just does.

09:52.700 --> 09:53.980
Can't you just get
somebody else?

09:54.100 --> 09:55.300
No.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.940
Eric, I don't ask
for much...

10:00.140 --> 10:01.780
Just stop, will ya?
Please...

10:01.940 --> 10:03.900
I won't fucking tell you
anything in future

10:04.060 --> 10:05.700
if you're just gonna
fucking do this...

10:05.900 --> 10:08.700
and make me feel shit
about things.

10:08.860 --> 10:10.540
I'm not the rat here.

10:10.660 --> 10:12.100
Kem is.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.700
He's to blame.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.860
He did this to himself!

10:17.180 --> 10:19.580
He knew what would happen
if I found out.

10:19.780 --> 10:22.300
But he went ahead
and he fucking did it anyway.

What? When?

10:34.620 --> 10:36.980
Did you tell Bren yet?

10:37.180 --> 10:38.540
No.
You stay there.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.420
I'll tell him.

10:40.620 --> 10:41.740
I have to go.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.380
I want you to say that
you're not gonna do it.

10:43.540 --> 10:44.460
Talk about it later.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.060
No. Now!

10:46.220 --> 10:48.220
Say that you're not
gonna do it!

10:48.380 --> 10:49.820

This seems like
a lot of fuss

11:59.220 --> 12:01.140
for something that could be done
over the phone.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.540
That's not your concern.

12:03.740 --> 12:06.140
You just worry about
paying your debt.

12:06.300 --> 12:10.900

12:11.100 --> 12:12.140
If you're staying

a good restaurant.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.180
It's all gone through.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.580
I'll see you
next month, then.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.380
Oh, you will.

What's the problem?

14:22.780 --> 14:24.380
It might be nothing.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.340
I can sense a "but."

14:26.540 --> 14:29.220
But I got a heads-up
from the DPP

14:29.380 --> 14:31.060
that they're preparing
an application

14:31.260 --> 14:33.860
to postpone
your trial date.

14:34.020 --> 14:35.780
Why?

14:35.940 --> 14:38.900
They say they need more time
to prepare their case.

14:39.060 --> 14:41.380
But they have everything.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.580
We signed over the dealership,
they have Jenny's statement,

14:43.740 --> 14:45.780
we gave all the files
and documents.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.820
You said that they had
accepted Jenny's statement

14:48.020 --> 14:50.020
and a prison sentence
wasn't likely.

14:50.220 --> 14:53.140
I said if they accepted
her statement,

14:53.340 --> 14:55.620
a custodial sentence
wasn't likely.

14:59.260 --> 15:03.860
I pay you very well to be
on top of these things.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.540
It's your job to keep me
out of prison.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.780
They've had months
to prepare.

15:13.940 --> 15:16.220
Why would they be asking
to postpone at this late day?

15:16.420 --> 15:18.580
Maybe they have new evidence
they want to look into.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.740
Like what?

15:19.900 --> 15:21.100
You tell me.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.140
There's nothing
I can think of.

15:25.340 --> 15:26.740
Then go back over
everything you've done

15:26.940 --> 15:28.540
in the last month or so
and look for anything

15:28.700 --> 15:31.340
that might've caught
their attention.

Lee: Rory showed up earlier.
He said Amanda had okayed it.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.180
And you just let him
fucking take it?

15:52.420 --> 15:54.020
I would've called,
Bren.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.140
But it was 6:00 in the morning,
and I didn't want to wake you.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.140
Who the fuck is this Rory,
anyway?

15:58.300 --> 15:59.380
Rory Hayes.

15:59.580 --> 16:02.340
Amanda's driver,
he does her shit work.

16:02.540 --> 16:04.660
She's fucking taken it
and sold it at a loss

16:04.820 --> 16:06.940
like we told her not to.

16:07.140 --> 16:10.340
We're gonna have to
teach her a lesson.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.140
Do you know where
this Rory cunt lives?

16:12.340 --> 16:13.940
Somewhere
on the Larchfield Estate.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.460
But I have a mate who'll know
the exact address.

16:15.620 --> 16:16.660
I can text him
if you want.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.660
Yeah, text him.

16:18.780 --> 16:20.020
Told you what she's like.

16:20.220 --> 16:21.900
She does whatever the fuck
she wants.

16:22.060 --> 16:23.820
Not for much longer.

16:23.980 --> 16:25.620
Listen, you.

16:25.820 --> 16:28.500
In future, no one touches any
fucking gear without my say-so.

16:28.660 --> 16:29.740
Do you hear me?

16:29.940 --> 16:31.220
What about Frank
or Michael?

16:31.420 --> 16:33.300
I just fucking said,
didn't I?

16:33.460 --> 16:34.460
No one!

about what happened last night,

16:46.500 --> 16:47.700
don't even fucking bother.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.900
Who I sleep with
is my own fucking business.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.340
Yeah, but you never actually
sleep with anyone,

16:51.500 --> 16:52.700
do you, Michael?

16:52.860 --> 16:53.940
That's the point.
It's fucking weird.

16:54.140 --> 16:55.820
Is Da putting you up
to all this shit?

16:56.020 --> 16:57.620
Nobody's putting me up
to anything.

16:57.780 --> 16:58.980
'Cause Viking I get.

16:59.140 --> 17:01.220
He's too young to remember
what Da's really like.

17:01.340 --> 17:02.420
What's your fucking excuse?

17:02.580 --> 17:04.900
I don't need
a fucking excuse.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.020
See, your issues with Da
are your issues.

17:07.220 --> 17:08.340
Don't drag me
into that shit.

Oh, shit...

You take it.

drug money in my house.

gonna say this once.

You don't do fuckin' shit
in future

with me first.

19:35.540 --> 19:36.660

19:36.860 --> 19:38.380
What about Amanda?
Are you deaf?!

19:38.580 --> 19:40.220
Aah!
Rory! Don't!

19:40.380 --> 19:43.700

Rory!

The guards, they closed the pub
after the shooting, so --

21:03.665 --> 21:05.345
so we all went out
to a club.

21:12.025 --> 21:14.785
Uh, the DPP want to push back
my trial date.

21:18.265 --> 21:20.745

No.

Molly: So, I'd probably
recommend this one,

25:03.705 --> 25:05.745
just because if you have had
a virus recently,

25:05.945 --> 25:08.945
then your immune system's
gonna be quite...low.

25:09.145 --> 25:10.425
Okay.
Uh, and it has
zinc included,

25:10.585 --> 25:11.985
so you don't have to worry
about taking that separately.

25:12.185 --> 25:13.185

Yeah.

you said that if --

25:49.585 --> 25:51.905
if I'd any issues
with the meds to say.

25:52.105 --> 25:54.305
Sure. Yeah.
What's the problem?

25:54.425 --> 25:56.465
Uh, the ep-epilepsy.

25:56.665 --> 26:00.145
Um, it was fine for a while,
but it feels like now

26:00.345 --> 26:01.945
the seizures
are starting to come back.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.545
Yeah.
And have you been taking them

26:03.745 --> 26:05.545
every day, as prescribed?
Yeah.

26:05.705 --> 26:06.945
Um, what about triggers?

26:07.145 --> 26:09.025
Has there been an increased
intake in alcohol?

26:09.025 --> 26:10.025
No.
Drugs?

26:10.025 --> 26:11.025
No.

26:11.025 --> 26:12.625
Or stress in your life?

26:14.505 --> 26:16.145
Yeah, stress can be
a significant trigger.

26:16.305 --> 26:17.585
Yeah, well, it's, like,

26:17.785 --> 26:19.745
fucking hard to avoid,
though, innit?

26:19.945 --> 26:23.065
There's ways. Have you --
Have you tried meditation?

26:23.185 --> 26:24.705
Yoga?

26:24.865 --> 26:26.425
You joking?
No.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.105
Just in case
you're interested.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.505
Okay.

26:36.705 --> 26:38.425
Look, you can speak
to your consultant

26:38.665 --> 26:40.385
about an increase in dosage,
but that just might mean

26:40.585 --> 26:42.825
that there will be a higher risk
of adverse side effects.

26:43.025 --> 26:43.985
I know you were worried
about that.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.585
Okay, yeah,
I'll do that.

26:45.785 --> 26:46.785
Okay.

26:46.785 --> 26:48.225
Thanks.

26:50.505 --> 26:51.985
Beep

26:54.265 --> 26:55.745
What's your name?

26:55.905 --> 26:57.025
Hm? Molly.

26:57.185 --> 26:58.345
Molly.

26:58.505 --> 27:00.705
Yeah.

27:00.865 --> 27:02.905
Yeah, thanks, Molly.

27:03.025 --> 27:04.105
Okay.

27:04.225 --> 27:05.785
You're welcome.

27:07.905 --> 27:09.425
Hi.
How are you?

27:13.545 --> 27:15.025
Alarm chirps

27:16.625 --> 27:18.025
Hey, cheers.

27:19.225 --> 27:22.265
Buzzer

27:22.425 --> 27:24.185
Lock clicks

27:24.385 --> 27:27.065
Upbeat fiddle music plays

27:27.185 --> 27:28.985
Alright?

27:29.105 --> 27:31.225
What's up?

27:31.385 --> 27:33.185
I found Glen Wright
for you.

27:33.345 --> 27:34.825
Let's talk out the back.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.025
##

27:37.185 --> 27:39.545
Johner was telling me about
that shooting you had here.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.185
-Fuckin' mad.
-Yeah.

27:41.345 --> 27:42.705
Kem: I thought having
that security thing

27:42.865 --> 27:44.065
would lose you
loads of business

27:44.265 --> 27:45.625
'cause people don't want
to be pushing a button

27:45.785 --> 27:47.105
going into a pub, you know?

27:47.265 --> 27:50.305
But it's money well spent.

27:50.505 --> 27:53.585
And it makes the place like
a members club or something.

27:53.785 --> 27:55.385
A members club.

27:55.545 --> 27:57.065
Yeah, I like that.

27:58.665 --> 28:00.265
Keys clatter

28:03.585 --> 28:05.785
Door closes

28:05.985 --> 28:08.345
You've got blood
on you, there.

28:08.505 --> 28:09.625
Have I?

28:11.345 --> 28:12.785
Where?

28:12.945 --> 28:15.585
##

28:15.745 --> 28:17.545
Exhales sharply

28:17.665 --> 28:19.345
So, you found Wright.

28:19.505 --> 28:20.945
Yeah.

28:21.145 --> 28:22.545
He's back living
with his mom.

28:22.745 --> 28:24.945
She has this encampment
out past Tallaght.

28:25.145 --> 28:26.745
What, they're living
in fuckin' tents?

28:26.905 --> 28:28.505
No.

28:28.705 --> 28:30.705
A gaff with a big metal fence
and barbed wire all around it.

28:30.865 --> 28:32.105
Ah, you mean a compound.

28:32.225 --> 28:34.065
Yeah, a compound.

28:34.225 --> 28:35.905
Right.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.345
I want you to go back out there
later with Eric

28:38.505 --> 28:40.345
and show him exactly
where this place is.

28:40.505 --> 28:43.705
It's a waste of time.
You won't get near him there.

28:43.905 --> 28:45.905
Need to catch him
when he's out and about.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.265
I don't care.

28:47.465 --> 28:50.505
I want you to show Eric
where this place is.

28:50.705 --> 28:52.025
Probably won't even
fucking see him.

28:52.185 --> 28:55.745
Just do
as you're fucking told.

28:55.905 --> 28:57.945
Okay. Yeah.

28:58.105 --> 29:01.745
Eric will call you later,
arrange everything.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.025
Sound.

29:03.225 --> 29:04.545
-Yeah.
-Laters, V.

29:04.745 --> 29:06.185
Laters.
Clears throat

29:08.705 --> 29:11.265
For fuck's sake,
you could at least try

29:11.465 --> 29:13.625
and act fuckin' normal
around him.

29:16.225 --> 29:18.985
Maybe Jimmy got it wrong
about Kem.

29:19.185 --> 29:21.185
I mean,
it's coming from Amanda.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.505
I don't trust
a thing she says.

29:23.665 --> 29:25.625
So you don't think
he sold us out?

29:28.625 --> 29:29.945
I don't know.

29:31.785 --> 29:34.545
Look, all I'm saying is,

29:34.745 --> 29:38.745
doing Kem on Amanda's word
feels wrong to me.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.545
Maybe there's
other options.

29:40.705 --> 29:43.585
Like what?

29:43.745 --> 29:46.145
Kneecap him.
Run him out of Dublin.

29:46.305 --> 29:48.545
I don't know.
Something.

29:48.705 --> 29:58.105
##

29:58.305 --> 30:00.105
Nah.

30:00.265 --> 30:02.505
And when it's done, be sure
and get his phone off him.

30:02.705 --> 30:03.945
Right?
Get rid of it.

30:04.105 --> 30:05.745
Don't leave that
lying around, okay?

30:05.865 --> 30:08.465
##

30:08.625 --> 30:10.865
Yeah.

30:11.025 --> 30:13.745
And you need someone else
with you, so take Anthony.

30:13.905 --> 30:17.745
##

30:17.945 --> 30:19.545
Should I check
with Jimmy first?

30:19.745 --> 30:21.225
Nah.
He won't mind.

30:21.425 --> 30:23.625
He wants Anthony
getting more involved.

30:23.785 --> 30:32.745
##

30:40.158 --> 30:42.398
Do you want a tea or a coffee
or something, Frank?

30:42.598 --> 30:44.318
No, thanks.
No, you're grand.

30:46.198 --> 30:47.598
So, what's the problem?

30:47.798 --> 30:49.798
Eric tell you
what Bren has him doing?

30:49.958 --> 30:52.038
No. What?

30:52.198 --> 30:54.598
He wants him
to shoot Kem.

30:54.758 --> 30:56.118
Kem?

30:56.318 --> 30:58.398
Look, I was thinking that maybe
you could talk to Bren,

30:58.598 --> 31:00.998
get him
to change his mind.

31:01.198 --> 31:03.958
Well, he won't
listen to me.

31:04.118 --> 31:06.918
You were in charge, Frank.
Of course he will.

31:07.118 --> 31:08.318
Look, you just
have to tell him

31:08.518 --> 31:10.198
that you want
somebody else to do it.

31:12.198 --> 31:13.638
Do you really want
to help Eric?

31:13.758 --> 31:15.478
Yeah, of course I do.

31:15.638 --> 31:17.758
Then make sure he has it
planned out properly.

31:17.958 --> 31:19.358
Scoffs

31:19.518 --> 31:21.758
No fuck-ups.

31:21.878 --> 31:23.358
That's your advice?

31:23.558 --> 31:24.598
Do you want him
locked up again?

31:24.758 --> 31:26.558
I don't want them
doing it at all.

31:26.798 --> 31:28.158
I think it might be
a bit late for that.

31:28.358 --> 31:32.598
For fuck's sake, Frank,
you're supposed to be his Da.

31:32.718 --> 31:35.398
Just talk to him.

31:35.598 --> 31:38.838
Make sure he has it
all worked out.

31:38.958 --> 31:40.998
Do you know what, Frank?

31:41.158 --> 31:42.878
You're fucking useless.

31:44.038 --> 31:50.798
##

31:50.958 --> 31:57.718
##

31:57.838 --> 32:00.318
Where now?

32:00.518 --> 32:03.318
You go on.
I'm gonna walk.

32:03.478 --> 32:05.718
Walk where?

32:05.878 --> 32:07.598
What are you?
Me wife?

32:09.158 --> 32:11.038
Go on, fuck off!

32:11.198 --> 32:16.318
##

32:16.478 --> 32:18.438
Car door closes, engine starts

32:18.598 --> 32:26.478

32:26.638 --> 32:34.518

32:34.678 --> 32:42.598

32:42.758 --> 32:50.678

32:50.798 --> 32:58.758

32:58.918 --> 33:01.078
Glass shatters

33:01.198 --> 33:03.878

33:30.798 --> 33:38.958
##

33:41.798 --> 33:43.598
Jesus Christ, Rory.

33:50.918 --> 33:53.158
He beat him
with a tire iron.

33:53.358 --> 33:55.598
Nearly bit
half his ear off.

33:55.798 --> 33:57.598
I won't be able to drive you
looking like this.

33:57.718 --> 34:00.798
Don't worry about that.

34:00.958 --> 34:03.918
You just get better.
I'll sort it out.

34:06.278 --> 34:09.958
Bren says I'm not to do anything
without checking with him first.

34:10.158 --> 34:12.398
And if we don't,
he'll shoot me.

34:12.598 --> 34:15.478
That Bren is
a fucking animal.

34:15.598 --> 34:18.318
As I said...

34:18.438 --> 34:19.958
I'll fix this.

34:21.918 --> 34:23.518
That's grand.

34:23.718 --> 34:26.398
Until you do, I'm gonna
have to take a step back.

34:31.078 --> 34:32.798
I understand.

34:35.598 --> 34:43.038
##

34:43.198 --> 34:50.598

##

35:09.198 --> 35:17.318
##

35:17.478 --> 35:20.078
I'm building partnerships
in Ireland,

35:20.278 --> 35:24.118
and you were recommended
by mutual associates.

35:24.278 --> 35:26.918
And what exactly would
being your partner entail?

35:27.078 --> 35:31.678
My family would underwrite
your business, help you expand.

35:31.878 --> 35:33.678
Why would you
do that for me?

35:33.878 --> 35:37.478
Because I intend to supply
the Irish market,

35:37.638 --> 35:40.598
and having associates here
makes that easier.

35:40.798 --> 35:42.998
You already have
the Kinsellas.

35:43.198 --> 35:45.798
I don't think they will be
around for long.

35:45.958 --> 35:49.798
Being in business with my family
has many advantages.

35:49.998 --> 35:54.398
I can provide you with product,
finance, weapons.

35:54.558 --> 35:58.118
And you'll have our protection,
should you need it.

36:00.958 --> 36:03.438
And what do I have to do
in return?

36:03.558 --> 36:06.078
Nothing.

36:06.238 --> 36:07.878
Yet.

36:08.078 --> 36:11.198
For now, just know
that I'm here

36:11.438 --> 36:13.478
in case you need
anything at all.

36:28.158 --> 36:29.678
Okay.

37:51.998 --> 37:53.718
Michael:
I have to ask you something.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.878
You recognize that?

38:01.038 --> 38:02.678
Where'd you get that?

38:02.838 --> 38:04.358
From your grandmother.

38:06.638 --> 38:08.198
Who gave it to you?

38:11.238 --> 38:13.078
I asked you
a question, Anna.

38:13.278 --> 38:15.438
Granddad.
Right.

38:15.638 --> 38:18.798
Well, I want you
to stay away from him.

38:18.958 --> 38:20.918
How come Anthony gets
to see him and I don't?

38:21.118 --> 38:25.118
Because Anthony's not
my daughter, and you are.

38:25.318 --> 38:27.638
This is exactly what they say
to me about you.

38:27.838 --> 38:30.118
Not to see you,
not to talk to you.

38:30.318 --> 38:33.318
But I still do.
Anna, this is not a joke.

38:33.518 --> 38:34.518
I don't want you
anywhere near him.

38:34.718 --> 38:37.118
Is that clear?
Why?

38:37.278 --> 38:38.878
He seems really nice.

38:39.038 --> 38:41.638
Well, he's not.

38:41.838 --> 38:43.838
Now, if you need money or
anything else, you come to me.

38:43.998 --> 38:46.638
I'll give it to you.
Alright?

38:46.758 --> 38:48.078
Yeah, fine.

38:48.198 --> 38:49.798
Girl: Anna!

38:51.878 --> 38:55.478
Promise me, if he makes contact
again, you'll let me know.

38:55.598 --> 38:57.158
I promise.

38:59.758 --> 39:01.358
I promise.

39:03.558 --> 39:04.878
Alright, go.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.318
I love you.

39:06.438 --> 39:08.798

Footsteps

39:36.398 --> 39:38.198
Did you break that door?

39:38.398 --> 39:40.598
I'll pay for
the fucking glass.

39:40.758 --> 39:43.398
That's not the point.

39:43.558 --> 39:45.398
You can't just
break in here.

39:45.558 --> 39:47.878
I thought God's house
was open to everyone.

39:48.038 --> 39:50.518
I thought you didn't believe
in any of that.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.358
I don't.

39:54.798 --> 39:58.998
Just in here,
it's so, um...

39:59.118 --> 40:00.878
peaceful.

40:13.878 --> 40:17.078
Would you like me to hear
your confession, Frank?

40:17.198 --> 40:18.758
There's no point.

40:18.918 --> 40:20.718
##

40:20.958 --> 40:23.118
I'm not sorry for any
of the things I did.

40:23.238 --> 40:25.318
##

40:25.478 --> 40:26.918
Then what do you want?

40:27.078 --> 40:29.918
##

40:30.078 --> 40:31.918
I have no fucking idea.

40:32.038 --> 40:35.918
##

40:36.078 --> 40:40.678
I'll be here, waiting,

40:40.918 --> 40:43.238
when you're ready
to repent.

40:43.398 --> 40:47.198
##

40:47.478 --> 40:49.798
TV plays indistinctly

40:49.998 --> 40:52.038
Knock on door

40:53.878 --> 40:55.358
Everything alright?

40:55.558 --> 40:57.158
Door closes

40:57.318 --> 40:59.558
All good.
It's all good.

40:59.718 --> 41:02.638
You want a chip?

41:02.758 --> 41:03.958
Fuck it.

41:06.238 --> 41:08.678
Just a heads-up
for you --

41:08.838 --> 41:11.998
I have Anthony out
on a job with Eric.

41:12.118 --> 41:14.558
What kind of job?

41:14.718 --> 41:16.438
That thing with Kem.

41:19.118 --> 41:20.438
No.

41:21.438 --> 41:23.118
No. The...

41:23.358 --> 41:24.718
Why the fuck
did you do that?

41:24.918 --> 41:26.118
Because
he's well able for it.

41:26.278 --> 41:27.638
He's 16, Da.

41:27.838 --> 41:29.478
Well, so was Michael.
It didn't do him any harm.

41:29.638 --> 41:31.838
I don't care. I don't care.
I don't want Anthony doing this.

41:32.038 --> 41:33.678
Well, too late now, isn't it?
It's done.

41:33.878 --> 41:34.918
Fuck that.
Fuck you.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.278
I'm calling him.
I'm bringing him back.

41:36.438 --> 41:37.518
They didn't bring phones
with them.

41:37.638 --> 41:39.118
They're not fucking stupid.

41:39.278 --> 41:40.958
You had no
fucking right, Dad.

41:41.118 --> 41:42.558
It's what the boy wants.

41:42.758 --> 41:44.238
And there's nothing you can do
about that,

41:44.438 --> 41:46.158
so give it a rest
with all the fuckin'

41:46.358 --> 41:48.238
huffin' and puffin'
and shit.

41:54.638 --> 41:55.918
Door slams

41:56.078 --> 41:57.358
Hey!

41:57.558 --> 41:59.478
What?
Got something to say?

41:59.598 --> 42:01.078
No.

42:01.238 --> 42:03.878
No. Nothing.

42:04.038 --> 42:10.758
##

42:10.878 --> 42:17.678
##

42:17.878 --> 42:19.918
Breathing heavily

42:20.078 --> 42:29.838
##

42:29.998 --> 42:39.798
##

42:39.918 --> 42:49.718
##

42:49.878 --> 42:59.678
##

42:59.838 --> 43:09.638
##

43:09.758 --> 43:11.558
You sure about this?

43:11.718 --> 43:13.358
Yeah.

43:13.518 --> 43:15.878
'Cause if you're not,
I can get Lee

43:16.078 --> 43:18.598
or someone else
to come along instead.

43:18.758 --> 43:20.278
No.

43:20.398 --> 43:22.358
I want to do it.

43:22.518 --> 43:23.758
Okay.

43:23.918 --> 43:30.558
##

43:30.758 --> 43:32.638
Doorbell rings

43:36.278 --> 43:37.558
Is he here?

43:37.718 --> 43:38.838
No.

43:40.838 --> 43:44.878
Winnie turned up with 3 grand
he'd given to Anna.

43:45.038 --> 43:47.758
Why didn't you tell me
about Kem?

43:56.798 --> 43:58.718
Door closes

44:08.918 --> 44:10.318
We were worried
that Frank and Viking

44:10.518 --> 44:11.918
would find out
and have him killed.

44:12.078 --> 44:13.318
That is what he deserves.

44:13.518 --> 44:15.318
He helped us get Eamon
and Con Doyle.

44:15.438 --> 44:17.438
To save his own skin!

44:21.278 --> 44:22.718
Your father knows
about it.

44:22.878 --> 44:24.118
How?

44:24.278 --> 44:25.318
Jimmy.

44:25.518 --> 44:26.918
Fuck's sake.

44:27.118 --> 44:30.518
So I don't need to tell you
what's gonna happen.

44:30.718 --> 44:32.758
Bren has been gunning
for Amanda since he got out,

44:32.958 --> 44:35.878
and you have given him
the excuse to go after her.

44:36.038 --> 44:38.918
He knows better
than to hurt her.

44:39.078 --> 44:41.038
Do you really
think that?

44:44.318 --> 44:46.558
You should have told us
about Kem, Michael.

44:46.718 --> 44:49.598
You have made
everything worse now.

44:50.558 --> 44:55.798
##

44:55.998 --> 44:57.598
Horn honks

44:57.758 --> 45:00.478
##

45:00.678 --> 45:02.718
Anto,
put your hood up, okay?

45:02.838 --> 45:06.118
##

45:06.278 --> 45:08.318
Better fucking be here.

45:08.518 --> 45:09.638
Door slams

45:09.798 --> 45:11.678
Oh, for fuck's sake.

45:11.798 --> 45:19.078
##

45:19.238 --> 45:21.078
You can't bring her.

45:21.278 --> 45:24.318
-Why not?
-'Cause this is work.

45:24.438 --> 45:25.758
Having Chloe's good.

45:25.958 --> 45:27.118
No one ever thinks
you're up to anything

45:27.318 --> 45:28.318
if you've got
a baby with you.

45:28.518 --> 45:29.718
I don't care.
She's not coming.

45:29.878 --> 45:32.078
I've no one to mind her, V.
Jess is at work.

45:32.318 --> 45:34.118
Can't leave her at a fucking
crèche or somewhere?

45:34.278 --> 45:35.478
I won't leave her
with strangers, man.

45:35.678 --> 45:37.678
It's not good.
Oh, for fuck's sake, Kem.

45:37.878 --> 45:39.078
Leave her with a neighbor
then, man.

45:39.278 --> 45:40.758
She doesn't know them.
I don't care.

45:40.958 --> 45:43.758
Leave her somewhere.
You're not bringing her.

45:43.918 --> 45:45.918
Look, if we see Wright --

45:46.078 --> 45:47.438
We won't.

45:47.638 --> 45:50.038
Yeah, but if we do,
I'm gonna have a pop, okay?

45:50.238 --> 45:52.038
You don't want
Chloe there for that.

45:52.238 --> 45:53.998
Baby fussing

45:54.158 --> 45:56.398
##

45:56.598 --> 45:58.638
Okay.
Okay.

45:58.758 --> 46:03.878
##

46:04.038 --> 46:09.158
##

46:09.358 --> 46:10.878
Do you think
he's suspicious

46:11.038 --> 46:12.958
'cause you won't let him
bring the baby?

46:14.078 --> 46:18.238
Conversing indistinctly

46:18.398 --> 46:20.238
We'll soon find out.

46:20.398 --> 46:24.078
##

46:24.278 --> 46:26.318
Buzzer

46:26.438 --> 46:30.758
##

46:30.918 --> 46:33.118
You were right about Bren
coming after me anyway.

46:33.278 --> 46:34.398
Why?
What's he done?

46:34.638 --> 46:35.998
He gave Rory a beating.
Sighs

46:36.198 --> 46:37.598
Told him that if he ever
does anything

46:37.758 --> 46:39.598
I ask again,
he'll kill him.

46:39.758 --> 46:42.398
You know he's got his claws
into Jimmy and Anthony, too?

46:42.558 --> 46:46.158
##

46:46.358 --> 46:47.758
Bren's found out
about Kem.

46:47.918 --> 46:51.878
##

46:52.038 --> 46:54.198
Kem: She's been fed and changed
and everything.

46:54.438 --> 46:56.558
Jess will be home from work,
anyway, in about an hour.

46:56.718 --> 46:59.718
I know to call you
if there's any problems.

46:59.878 --> 47:01.318
Alright, baby.

47:01.438 --> 47:03.038
##

47:03.038 --> 47:04.118
Yeah.

47:04.118 --> 47:06.038
Speaking indistinctly

47:06.198 --> 47:09.318
##

47:09.478 --> 47:11.238
I'm gonna call Kem,
warn him.

47:11.358 --> 47:13.638
Can't do that, Amanda.

47:13.798 --> 47:14.838
Can't fucking do that.

47:15.038 --> 47:16.358
Why not?
Because if you do,

47:16.518 --> 47:18.318
no one in this family
is gonna trust you again.

47:18.478 --> 47:20.398
But he has a daughter.
It doesn't matter.

47:20.598 --> 47:23.198
She's just a baby.
She's a tiny, little baby.

47:23.398 --> 47:25.798
Kem knew the risk he was taking
when he went to Eamon.

47:25.958 --> 47:27.078
He helped us get them.

47:27.238 --> 47:28.838
Doesn't change
what he did.

47:28.998 --> 47:30.638
Fuck Bren!

47:30.798 --> 47:36.078
##

47:36.278 --> 47:38.598
Bren is gonna
fucking pay.

47:38.718 --> 47:47.238
##

47:47.398 --> 47:55.838
##

47:56.038 --> 47:58.238
Okay, then.
Let's go.

47:58.398 --> 48:07.878
##

48:08.038 --> 48:17.558
##

48:17.678 --> 48:27.198
##

48:27.358 --> 48:36.958
##

48:37.078 --> 48:46.558
##

48:46.678 --> 48:56.238
##

48:56.358 --> 49:05.838
##

49:05.998 --> 49:15.518
##

49:15.678 --> 49:25.158
##

49:25.398 --> 49:34.838
##

49:35.038 --> 49:44.558
##
