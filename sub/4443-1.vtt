00:17.434 --> 00:18.634
You're getting out today, huh?

00:18.669 --> 00:20.503
That's what we heard.

00:22.406 --> 00:24.107
Why are you so quiet, huh?

00:24.141 --> 00:26.209
[gasps]

00:26.243 --> 00:29.145
Who was all mouth the other day
when I confronted you in the showers?

00:29.179 --> 00:32.081
Lost my yard privileges 'cause of you.

00:35.886 --> 00:37.086
[grunts]

00:37.121 --> 00:41.858
[piano playing]

01:13.457 --> 01:16.025

01:21.065 --> 01:23.066
<i>[phone beeps] Hey, it's Stef,</i>

01:23.100 --> 01:25.868
<i>I'm either working or avoiding your...</i>

01:25.903 --> 01:27.003
[hangs up]

01:27.037 --> 01:28.137
Hi, Lena?

01:28.172 --> 01:30.006
I'm David.

01:31.041 --> 01:33.776
Uh... where's Bill?

01:33.811 --> 01:35.678
I just spoke with him, he's
supposed to meet with me here.

01:35.712 --> 01:37.680
Um, yeah, Bill. One of his cases...

01:37.714 --> 01:39.615
Well, a kid in one of
his foster homes OD'd,

01:39.650 --> 01:40.750
so he had to rush to the hospital.

01:40.784 --> 01:42.618
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, it's terrible.

01:42.653 --> 01:44.420
- I take it he told you about Callie?
- Yes.

01:44.455 --> 01:45.788
Yes, well, it seems that she's been having

01:45.823 --> 01:48.624
a few issues with male
authority figures, of late.

01:48.659 --> 01:50.493
- Which is...
- That's why he thought of us.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.529
- Right.
- So, she got into a fight with her foster father?

01:53.564 --> 01:56.399
And damaged some of his property,
which is how she landed here in juvie.

01:56.433 --> 02:01.104
Damaged his property. Uh... Wow. David...

02:01.138 --> 02:03.172
Bill and I have known each
other for a very long time,

02:03.207 --> 02:05.274
and he's been a friend of the family
ever since he placed the twins with us,

02:05.309 --> 02:08.311
but I cannot bring someone
violent into my house.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.345
I've got my own kids to think about.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.913
No, this was just a one time thing.

02:10.948 --> 02:12.281
Listen, it'll only just be for a few weeks.

02:12.316 --> 02:14.851
[buzzing]

02:14.885 --> 02:17.153
- [Lena] Oh my goodness.
- [David] Um...

02:17.187 --> 02:20.790
When the kids get out, some of the other
inmates get jealous and pick fights.

02:20.824 --> 02:22.725
- One second. One second?
- But...

02:22.759 --> 02:24.827
Callie? Callie, hi.

02:24.862 --> 02:27.663
I'm David, I work with Bill
at Child Protective Services.

02:27.698 --> 02:29.832
Um... where's Jude? Do
you know where he is?

02:29.867 --> 02:31.868
- [David] I don't know...
- [Callie] I need to speak to him.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.469
Where's Bill? Why isn't Bill here?

02:33.504 --> 02:34.837
[David] We'll have to
talk about that later.

02:34.872 --> 02:37.507
I just, I don't understand
why I can't talk to Jude.

02:37.541 --> 02:40.643
[David] That's enough. I don't
know what you're talking about.

02:40.677 --> 02:45.414
Callie, this is Lena. Lena, Callie.

02:47.618 --> 02:51.354
I guess I could take her
to one of the group homes.

03:00.831 --> 03:02.798
It's just for a few weeks, right?

03:07.171 --> 03:08.905
Ok.

03:10.160 --> 03:16.525
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:22.186 --> 03:25.121
So, Mariana and Jesus were
in the foster program, too.

03:25.155 --> 03:27.790
They came to us about eight years ago,

03:27.824 --> 03:31.060
and we formally adopted
them five years ago.

03:31.094 --> 03:33.930
- Foster system sucks.
- Jesus...

03:33.964 --> 03:35.097
[Mariana] He's right. It kind of does.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.833
- [Lena] Ok.
- What happened to your face?

03:37.868 --> 03:39.135
- Get in a fight?
- [Lena] Uh...

03:39.169 --> 03:40.870
Callie's kind of had a rough day.

03:40.904 --> 03:42.872
So, how about we cool
it with the third degree.

03:42.906 --> 03:45.775
Is there... where's the bathroom?

03:45.809 --> 03:47.743
Yeah, it's right through
there. You'll see it.

03:52.749 --> 03:55.184
So... where'd she come from?

03:55.219 --> 03:59.689
[chuckles] Um... I, I talked to Bill

03:59.723 --> 04:02.158
from Child Protective
Services, you remember him?

04:02.192 --> 04:05.995
To talk to him about something and he...

04:06.029 --> 04:07.930
you know, he was in a bind with Callie.

04:07.965 --> 04:10.866
And he needed some place for her to stay.

04:10.901 --> 04:14.070
She's had a rough time lately, so, I really
need you guys to be extra nice to her.

04:14.104 --> 04:16.706
- Please?
- What were you talking to Bill about?

04:16.740 --> 04:18.074
Guess.

04:21.111 --> 04:23.713
All right, so I was going to
wait till everyone was home

04:23.747 --> 04:25.915
to talk to you guys
about this. Have a seat.

04:28.752 --> 04:33.923
I was calling to find out when we could
set up a meeting with your birth mom.

04:39.096 --> 04:41.897
I thought you would be more excited.

04:41.932 --> 04:44.934
This is kind of all you've been
talking about for the last six months.

04:46.136 --> 04:47.937
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

04:47.971 --> 04:51.173
I did, just... I don't think so.

04:53.010 --> 04:54.877
Did Jesus talk you out of this?

04:54.911 --> 04:57.680
- Just because he doesn't want to go...
- Don't look at me.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.716
No, I just... changed my mind is all.

05:01.752 --> 05:03.052
[crying]

05:20.604 --> 05:22.672
Ok, so did you guys do your homework?

05:26.410 --> 05:27.643
What? Why you gotta look at me like that?

05:27.678 --> 05:29.645
Just 'cause you get straight
A's and you don't have to study?

05:29.680 --> 05:31.547
Jesus, everyone has their strengths.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.317
- Hey. Hey, guys.
- Hey! How was the audition?

05:34.351 --> 05:36.485
It was good, it was
good. I made the finals.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.454
- [gasping]
- Oh, my God!

05:38.488 --> 05:41.090
- That's fantastic.
- It's not that big of a deal.

05:41.124 --> 05:42.258
It is a huge deal. Are you kidding me?

05:42.292 --> 05:44.193
That's like a 5,000 dollar
scholarship, isn't it?

05:44.227 --> 05:46.228
- When is it?
- It's tomorrow and we're all going

05:46.263 --> 05:48.230
So, homework right after school, please?

05:49.232 --> 05:51.067
Who's this?

05:51.101 --> 05:52.604
Oh, this is Callie.

05:52.605 --> 05:54.945
She's going to be staying
with us for a little while.

05:55.038 --> 05:56.939
Oh, ok. Staying with us.

05:56.973 --> 06:00.910
Um, nice to meet you.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.645
What about him?

06:02.713 --> 06:03.813
What?

06:03.847 --> 06:05.748
How'd you get him?

06:05.782 --> 06:07.783
99 Cent Store? I mean,
they have everything there.

06:07.818 --> 06:12.755
Um, Brandon is my partner Stephanie's
biological son from her previous marriage.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.391
- Hey honey.
- Hi.

06:15.425 --> 06:18.294
It smells great. Lasagna.
Delicious, thank you.

06:18.328 --> 06:20.262
- How are you, honey?
- Good, how are you?

06:20.297 --> 06:21.364
Hi babies!

06:21.398 --> 06:23.532
What? Nobody told you our mom's a cop?

06:23.567 --> 06:26.202
See, this is why no boys
ever want to come over.

06:26.236 --> 06:29.105
- As it should be.
- So, you're dykes.

06:32.075 --> 06:33.876
They prefer the term "people,"

06:33.910 --> 06:35.144
but yeah, they're gay.

06:35.178 --> 06:37.146
And he's the real son.

06:39.916 --> 06:41.050
[chuckles]

06:43.687 --> 06:45.020
And who's this?

06:49.592 --> 06:51.893
I tried calling you several times.

06:51.928 --> 06:54.830
Yes, I know. You never left a message.

06:54.864 --> 06:56.798
What was I going to say
in a message about this?

06:56.833 --> 06:59.568
What do we know about this girl
that we're bringing into our house,

06:59.602 --> 07:02.437
with our children? What
happened to her face?

07:02.472 --> 07:04.506
She got beat up in juvie.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.442
- In juvie? Lena...
- I know, I know!

07:07.477 --> 07:09.244
I talked to Bill.

07:09.278 --> 07:11.246
She's not violent, she's
not dangerous in any way.

07:11.280 --> 07:15.117
- This was a one time thing.
- Honey, we can't save them all.

07:15.151 --> 07:17.119
It's just for a few weeks.

07:17.153 --> 07:19.087
I'm telling you, if you had been there,

07:19.122 --> 07:21.223
and seen the way this girl looked at me.

07:21.257 --> 07:24.192
Honey, I know you only did this
out of the goodness of your heart,

07:24.227 --> 07:27.062
and I can't get mad at you for that, can I?

07:27.096 --> 07:28.930
Oh, mushy.

07:28.965 --> 07:31.199
I ought to... bring kids home more often.

07:31.234 --> 07:33.769
Oh, please do not, 'cause any more kids,

07:33.803 --> 07:35.103
it's gonna be like The
Brady Bunch around here,

07:35.138 --> 07:39.808
and we're... we're definitely
not The Brady Bunch.

07:39.842 --> 07:42.744
[Stef] The curfew on school night is seven.

07:42.779 --> 07:45.814
You must ask permission from Lena
or myself before leaving the house.

07:45.848 --> 07:48.583
Also, you'll go to school
while you're staying here.

07:48.618 --> 07:52.788
Lena is the Vice Principal of
Anchor Beach Charter School,

07:52.822 --> 07:55.557
- All the kids go there...
- Where do I sleep?

07:56.559 --> 07:57.693
Excuse me?

07:57.727 --> 08:01.296
It's not my first time in a foster home.

08:01.330 --> 08:02.464
Where do I sleep?

08:04.434 --> 08:05.534
Let me show you.

08:09.539 --> 08:12.174
[sighs]

08:14.110 --> 08:15.377
One pillow or two?

08:18.247 --> 08:21.149
Ok, I'll leave them both.

08:21.184 --> 08:25.287
I left some towels for you in the
bathroom and do you have a toothbrush?

08:27.023 --> 08:28.790
No, I don't have a toothbrush.

08:28.825 --> 08:30.792
How would I have gotten a toothbrush?

08:30.827 --> 08:32.760
[sighs] Ok.

08:32.794 --> 08:35.764
Callie, we're on your side.

08:35.798 --> 08:38.799
You can take it down a notch, ok?

08:41.804 --> 08:43.605
Yeah.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.746
I noticed you were really upset when
you were talking to David earlier.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.548
Who's Jude?

08:57.453 --> 09:00.122
Look...

09:02.191 --> 09:04.126
When I went into juvie...

09:04.160 --> 09:06.361
Hey, here are some clothes
for you to sleep in.

09:06.395 --> 09:08.363
Tonight, if you want to leave your
clothes outside of the bathroom,

09:08.397 --> 09:11.133
I'll wash and make sure
they're clean for tomorrow, ok?

09:12.301 --> 09:14.936
Good night. [clears throat]

09:18.241 --> 09:19.841
You were saying?

09:22.745 --> 09:24.713
You have that toothbrush?

09:30.953 --> 09:34.990
[speaking Spanish]

09:35.024 --> 09:37.926
Oh, hey, you guys know the rules.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.928
[in Spanish]

09:39.962 --> 09:42.831
<i>- Ah, very good.
- Gracias, senor.</i>

09:45.501 --> 09:50.372
Hey, you two know that it's
not true what Callie said, huh?

09:50.406 --> 09:55.377
You two are every bit as much
our kids as Brandon is, yes?

09:55.411 --> 09:57.579
- We know.
- Miss Thing?

09:59.382 --> 10:01.283
Ok.

10:03.085 --> 10:04.419
- I love you, my babies.
- Good night.

10:04.453 --> 10:07.088
Mm, 15 minutes till lights out, ok?

10:39.622 --> 10:41.723
- [Stephanie] Hey baby.
- Hey.

10:41.757 --> 10:45.594
Hey. B, listen. Um...

10:45.628 --> 10:48.730
I really need you to step up while
Callie is in this house, all right?

10:51.434 --> 10:53.635
Um, I don't want to make
a big deal about this,

10:53.669 --> 10:56.238
especially with Mariana and Jesus,

10:56.272 --> 11:00.408
but between you and me, Callie
was in juvie for a little while.

11:00.443 --> 11:03.211
Then what is she doing in the house?

11:03.246 --> 11:05.447
She's fine.

11:05.481 --> 11:07.182
Lena and I would not have her in this house

11:07.216 --> 11:09.918
if she was not, you know that.

11:09.952 --> 11:13.054
So, I just need you to, I don't know...

11:13.089 --> 11:16.091
Ok. All right, well, I'll be sure to...

11:16.125 --> 11:17.859
"I don't know" as much as I can.

11:19.962 --> 11:22.097
Are you sure you're not
Lena's biological son?

11:22.131 --> 11:24.065
I've got so much homework to do now,

11:24.133 --> 11:25.901
<i>Moby-Dick waits for no man.</i>

11:25.935 --> 11:29.004
Oh, which reminds me, do you need condoms?

11:29.038 --> 11:31.806
- Oh, my God.
- You and Talya are using condoms, yeah?

11:31.841 --> 11:33.675
Yeah, the door is right there.

11:33.709 --> 11:34.910
What? Protect and serve. That's my job.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.745
- Mom.
- Ok.

11:38.547 --> 11:40.782
My little baby is
growing up. He's such a...

11:40.816 --> 11:44.319
- Get out.
- ... handsome young man.

12:03.205 --> 12:05.106
I needed some water.

12:38.407 --> 12:39.507
[beeps]

12:45.348 --> 12:46.648
Thank you.

12:49.485 --> 12:52.287
Ok, so I've been thinking...

12:52.321 --> 12:54.289
and I know how mad I would've been

12:54.323 --> 12:58.159
if you would've made such a huge
decision without consulting me.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.328
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.098
All right? I'm ok. She's not exactly the...

13:03.132 --> 13:05.000
the warmest kid I've ever met.

13:07.103 --> 13:09.804
I really appreciate you making the effort.

13:09.839 --> 13:11.139
It means a lot to me.

13:11.173 --> 13:13.174
Of course, my love.

13:16.779 --> 13:19.814
You know, I just think that poor girl has

13:19.849 --> 13:23.018
just been through so much.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.754
I'm just really glad we can
give her a place to stay.

13:25.788 --> 13:26.921
You know, that's safe.

13:26.956 --> 13:29.524
- For now.
- For now...

13:29.558 --> 13:31.926
As long as she doesn't mess
with our family. It's all good.

13:31.961 --> 13:34.462
Now get off my side, please.

13:34.497 --> 13:35.897
Ok, mama tiger.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.637
Do you want to hear something strange?

13:42.671 --> 13:45.373
[laughs] Sure.

13:46.375 --> 13:49.244
I talked to the twins about

13:49.278 --> 13:51.513
arranging a visit with their
birth mom, like we talked about.

13:51.547 --> 13:53.214
Mm-hm?

13:53.249 --> 13:56.418
And now, neither one
of them wants to do it.

13:56.452 --> 13:59.454
- Not even Mariana?

Uh, yeah. It's... don't worry about it.

26:52.453 --> 26:53.519
There'll be others.

26:55.522 --> 26:57.357
So, what happened?

26:57.391 --> 26:59.592
At the house?

27:02.629 --> 27:05.298
Well, my foster father
caught my little brother

27:05.332 --> 27:07.500
wearing one of his ex-wife's dresses.

27:07.534 --> 27:10.136
Started beating the crap out of him.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.305
Seriously? He hit him?

27:12.339 --> 27:16.242
Yeah. I mean, he used
to hit me all the time,

27:16.276 --> 27:18.344
but, you know, whatever.

27:18.379 --> 27:22.849
But, when I saw him going after Jude...

27:22.883 --> 27:26.219
I just... well, I tried to stop him,

27:26.253 --> 27:27.987
but he kicked me in the stomach.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.990
So, I went outside, grabbed a baseball bat,

27:31.025 --> 27:33.826
beat the hell out of his precious Trans Am.

27:33.861 --> 27:38.631
The cops came. He told
them that I went crazy,

27:38.665 --> 27:40.533
and he was defending himself.

27:41.735 --> 27:45.438
Nobody seemed to care much
about my side of the story.

27:50.477 --> 27:51.744
[Lena] Hey sweetheart.

27:53.614 --> 27:54.747
You ok?

27:54.782 --> 27:58.484
I just... I don't feel
so good. My stomach hurts.

27:58.519 --> 28:00.520
I don't think I'm going to be able
to go to Brandon's thing tonight.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.288
What, you feel like
you're going to throw up?

28:02.322 --> 28:05.224
No, I just... I think
I just ate something bad.

28:05.259 --> 28:07.126
I really need to lie down.

28:07.161 --> 28:11.297
Ok. Well, yeah, go lie down and
we'll see how you feel later.

28:17.304 --> 28:20.873
Hey, so, what's going on with Mariana?

28:20.908 --> 28:23.810
- What do you mean?
- Um, why is she pretending to be sick?

28:23.844 --> 28:26.112
I don't know. Maybe she's actually sick?

28:26.146 --> 28:27.814
Or it could be that time of the...

28:27.848 --> 28:29.148
If you say "time of the month,"

28:29.183 --> 28:32.718
I'm going to sign you up for a
women's health workshop at my OB-GYN.

28:32.753 --> 28:33.986
Don't ever say that in
a house full of women.

28:34.021 --> 28:36.656
Ok, ok. Jeez, well, if it's not that

28:36.690 --> 28:38.524
than I don't know what to tell you.

28:38.559 --> 28:40.726
- [sighs] Ok.
- [Stef] I'm home!

28:40.761 --> 28:42.795
Hey, put that away. You need
to get changed for Brandon's...

28:42.830 --> 28:45.398
- I just came down here!
- I know.

28:45.432 --> 28:48.468
Go. Now, Jesus. Go!

28:48.502 --> 28:50.536
Where is everybody?

28:52.406 --> 28:53.639
- Hi!
- Hey.

28:53.674 --> 28:57.276
What's wrong? Everything
all right with Callie?

28:57.311 --> 29:00.346
No, I haven't even checked
on her yet. I just walked in.

29:00.380 --> 29:04.550
I just... something's up with the twins.

29:04.585 --> 29:08.154
- Meaning?
- Well, Mariana's pretending to be sick.

29:08.188 --> 29:12.358
- Uh-huh, stomach ache? -
And Jesus is all clammed up.

29:12.392 --> 29:14.427
He's not saying something.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.162
Oh.

29:17.397 --> 29:21.033
Do you think it's about
Ana? Do you think...

29:21.068 --> 29:23.169
maybe I'm putting too
much pressure on Mariana?

29:23.203 --> 29:26.072
Absolutely not. I think she
has just changed her mind.

29:26.106 --> 29:28.141
They're not ready yet. Really, it's ok.

29:30.077 --> 29:33.846
- You keep me sane.
- [laughs]

29:36.817 --> 29:39.752
[laughing] I don't know how...

29:39.786 --> 29:42.989
sane you're going to feel after you
hear what happened at work today.

29:43.023 --> 29:45.825
Now that Vasquez is leaving,
you're never going to guess

29:45.859 --> 29:47.660
who Roberts is partnering me up with.

29:47.694 --> 29:49.595
- Who?
- Mike.

29:49.630 --> 29:52.431
Apparently, he asked for me.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.836
[laughs]

29:56.870 --> 30:00.373
Oh please, do not go all non-verbal on me.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.742
- It is not a big deal, honey.
- Hmm.

30:04.378 --> 30:06.412
- It's really not. It's...
- Mm.

30:06.446 --> 30:10.216
Now who's all clammed up.
Come on, honey. It's Mike.

30:10.250 --> 30:13.519
- It's just Mike.
- It's just Mike.

30:13.554 --> 30:16.189
[doorbell rings]

30:23.463 --> 30:26.999
- Hey Mike.
- Hey.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.267
You guys ready?

30:29.937 --> 30:31.170
Brandon, your dad's here!

30:31.205 --> 30:33.039
It's time for your competition!

30:33.073 --> 30:37.777
[sighs] He'll be down in a
second. I think he's nervous.

30:39.913 --> 30:41.147
Brandon?

30:46.787 --> 30:49.789
So, I hear you and Stef are going
to be back on the beat together.

30:49.823 --> 30:52.625
Oh, yeah.

30:52.659 --> 30:54.827
Stef says you asked for her.

30:54.861 --> 31:00.499
I did. Look, it was either me or a rookie.

31:00.534 --> 31:03.769
I was never comfortable when she
was working with Vasquez, I...

31:03.804 --> 31:08.441
Look, I just feel better
knowing I'm around. Ok?

31:08.475 --> 31:10.643
And we got the kids to think about.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.447
- Ok.
- Ok.

31:14.481 --> 31:16.549
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

31:16.583 --> 31:20.253
I mean, as a feminist, I'm totally
offended and everything, but...

31:20.287 --> 31:22.622
as her wife, you know, thanks.

31:22.656 --> 31:25.157
Yeah, just don't tell Stef I said that.

31:27.394 --> 31:31.063
- [sigh]
- God, where's that kid?

31:31.098 --> 31:33.933
Brandon, shake a leg! We're
going to do this thing!

31:33.967 --> 31:35.268
Hey Mike, you clean up nicely.

31:35.302 --> 31:37.270
Stef.

31:37.304 --> 31:39.038
Hey, why aren't you changed?

31:39.072 --> 31:40.973
- Hey, he's not here.
- What?

31:41.008 --> 31:42.141
Yeah, they didn't walk home with us.

31:42.175 --> 31:43.909
I just thought he was showing her around.

31:43.944 --> 31:45.945
Her who? Her, Callie, her?

31:45.979 --> 31:47.179
Yeah.

31:49.016 --> 31:50.149
[Mike] That's not like him.

31:50.183 --> 31:51.917
He knows he has the music thing tonight.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.053
- [Stef] I know it's not.
- I don't know who this girl is,

31:54.087 --> 31:58.758
or why you guys feel like you have to take
in strays like some damn homeless shelter.

31:58.792 --> 32:03.629
- Ok.
- So, where the hell are they?

32:06.089 --> 32:08.724
He's not answering. I'm going to try Talya.

32:08.759 --> 32:10.893
Look, I'm sure he's fine.

32:10.928 --> 32:12.695
He probably thought we were
going to meet him at the contest.

32:12.763 --> 32:14.897
Why don't I just head over
there and check it out?

32:14.932 --> 32:17.667
- Hey, have you seen Brandon?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

32:17.701 --> 32:19.569
I had this app installed
on all of our phones

32:19.603 --> 32:21.704
because that one kept losing his.

32:21.738 --> 32:22.348
Ok.

32:22.349 --> 32:23.648
She says the last time she saw him,

32:23.649 --> 32:25.522
he was talking to Callie
after seventh period.

32:25.642 --> 32:28.411
Maybe he's right. Maybe
we're just overreacting.

32:28.445 --> 32:30.646
If we're overreacting, what
are they doing in San Ysidro?

32:30.681 --> 32:32.448
What?

32:32.482 --> 32:34.417
- Are they going to Tijuana?
- I'm going to kill him.

32:34.451 --> 32:36.252
This is exactly what I was worried about.

32:36.286 --> 32:37.453
- Let's go.
- I'll drive.

32:49.433 --> 32:51.267
Hey, Brandon and Callie are missing.

32:51.301 --> 32:53.135
What do you mean "missing?"

32:53.170 --> 32:55.972
They never came home from school.

32:56.006 --> 32:57.974
Oh, huh.

32:59.309 --> 33:01.344
Hey, you didn't take
any of my pills, did you?

33:01.345 --> 33:03.403
What? No. Why?

33:03.404 --> 33:06.849
Well, Mom just got me a new
bottle, and now they're almost gone.

33:08.051 --> 33:09.885
What are you looking at me for?

33:09.920 --> 33:11.988
- I was just asking.
- Well, ask Brandon or Callie.

33:12.022 --> 33:13.990
Excuse me, I've got to go.

33:14.024 --> 33:15.891
Is that how you got all that money?

33:15.926 --> 33:17.793
- You selling my pills?
- No.

33:17.828 --> 33:20.863
'Cause I know sure as hell you
didn't get all that money from Mom.

33:20.897 --> 33:24.634
Or maybe you did? Maybe we should ask her.

33:27.704 --> 33:30.706
Why? Why would you do something so stupid?

33:30.741 --> 33:32.441
You could go to jail for that.

33:32.476 --> 33:34.710
What do you need all that money for anyway?

33:36.780 --> 33:38.481
I've been talking to Ana.

33:39.549 --> 33:40.716
Ana?

33:40.751 --> 33:42.585
Our... birth mom?

33:42.619 --> 33:45.488
She got back in town last
month. I found her online.

33:45.522 --> 33:47.223
You said you didn't want to meet her.

33:47.257 --> 33:49.425
No, I just...

33:49.459 --> 33:53.229
I didn't want Stef and Lena sticking
their noses all up in my business, ok?

33:53.263 --> 33:55.231
They wouldn't get it.
Ana needs some money...

33:55.265 --> 33:57.500
You're giving her money? For what? Why?

33:57.534 --> 34:00.469
- See, I knew you wouldn't understand.
- Understand?

34:00.504 --> 34:05.141
You want me to understand
that this woman is not our mom?

34:05.175 --> 34:07.343
She left her two kids so she
can run off with a dumb ass

34:07.377 --> 34:08.978
and screw who ever she wanted.

34:09.012 --> 34:10.913
She abandoned us. She left us.

34:10.947 --> 34:13.248
Well, she came back.

34:15.886 --> 34:18.020
I thought you were supposed
to be the smart one.

34:22.225 --> 34:23.958
[door opens, closes]

34:26.963 --> 34:28.764
[dog barking]

34:45.748 --> 34:47.382
[whispering] Jude.

34:59.362 --> 35:03.365
Hello? Is anybody home? I need help.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.302
[man] Hang on!

35:06.336 --> 35:09.071
- Are you deaf or what?
- [knocking]

35:12.109 --> 35:14.210
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes sir.

35:14.244 --> 35:17.279
I, um, I was looking for the Metro.

35:17.314 --> 35:20.883
- The Metro's a few miles from here.
- I got kind of lost.

35:20.917 --> 35:22.184
- You're lost.
- Yeah.

35:24.154 --> 35:28.758
All right, man. [sighs] You got
to go about six blocks that way...

35:28.792 --> 35:30.793
Whoa, hey! What the
hell are you doing here?

35:30.827 --> 35:32.828
- I just want to talk to Jude.
- No! Shut up! No!

35:32.863 --> 35:34.864
- No, you get out of this house!
- One second...

35:34.931 --> 35:37.833
- Hey, shut up!
- Ok, look. I am sorry about your car...

35:37.868 --> 35:41.604
- No, get out of here!
- Hey, don't touch her!

35:41.638 --> 35:43.539
- I can pay for it!
- Calm down, man.

35:43.573 --> 35:45.641
- Ok, shut up.
- Ok, ok, ok...

35:49.479 --> 35:50.646
[Stef] Gun!

35:50.680 --> 35:53.716
- Call 911.
- Lena, stay here.

35:55.519 --> 35:57.319
You know what, buddy? Just shut up!

35:57.354 --> 36:00.389
[muffled yelling]

36:07.497 --> 36:09.331
[man yelling indistinctly]

36:09.366 --> 36:12.301
Police, freeze! Freeze!
Get down on your knees now!

36:12.335 --> 36:14.570
- [man] Whoa! Whoa!
- Get down on your knees now!

36:14.604 --> 36:16.539
Put the gun down! Put the gun down!

36:16.573 --> 36:18.507
[man] Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

36:18.542 --> 36:21.310
- Honey, are you ok?
- [Mike] Hands on your head!

36:21.344 --> 36:24.046
- Don't move!
- Man, this is my house.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.948
Shut up! Shut up!

36:33.023 --> 36:35.224
[police siren wails]

36:48.972 --> 36:50.973
[phone rings]

37:10.026 --> 37:11.861
[Lena] And who is that?

37:11.895 --> 37:15.764
That's her brother, Jude.

37:15.799 --> 37:17.867
Look, I was just trying
to do the right thing, ok.

37:17.901 --> 37:19.668
I'm sorry about the scholarship.

37:19.703 --> 37:21.537
- I know we could've used the it...
- Brandon.

37:21.571 --> 37:25.574
I don't care about the
scholarship. That guy had a gun.

37:25.642 --> 37:27.543
Yeah.

37:27.577 --> 37:30.312
[sighs] Get in there.

37:39.589 --> 37:42.458
Hey, Skippy.

37:42.492 --> 37:45.361
My brother used to have that backpack.

37:46.229 --> 37:48.330
Cool.

37:48.365 --> 37:50.132
I would really like you to understand

37:50.166 --> 37:54.169
how this, tonight, could've
ended very, very badly.

37:56.306 --> 37:59.508
Look, if you want to send me back to juvie,

38:01.244 --> 38:05.381
then you just promise me
Jude will be somewhere safe.

38:06.983 --> 38:09.118
You're not disposable, Callie.

38:09.152 --> 38:11.020
You're...

38:11.054 --> 38:13.289
You're not worthless.

38:19.062 --> 38:21.830
Come on here, let's go, let's go.

38:21.865 --> 38:24.099
We'll take them home
for now, Bill. It's fine.

38:24.134 --> 38:26.835
It's fine. I will call you tomorrow.

38:27.804 --> 38:29.038
Ok.

38:33.643 --> 38:35.678
Hey.

38:35.712 --> 38:38.013
You know I'm going to kill you,
if your mom doesn't kill you first.

38:38.048 --> 38:39.982
Yeah.

38:41.751 --> 38:42.885
I love you, B.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.587
I love you, too.

38:49.759 --> 38:51.660
I'm sorry.

38:53.797 --> 38:56.665
But you didn't have to come.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.567
Yes, I did.

39:02.739 --> 39:04.606
[woman] Mariana?

39:08.611 --> 39:10.245
Hey...

39:12.382 --> 39:14.283
Wow.

39:17.487 --> 39:19.254
You're so pretty.

39:20.290 --> 39:23.225
Thanks. So are you.

39:29.265 --> 39:31.400
How've you been?

39:31.434 --> 39:37.339
Good. Good... Back in town. [laughs]

39:37.374 --> 39:43.278
And, uh, you know, I'm just
trying to get back on my feet.

39:45.215 --> 39:48.984
So, you got anything for me?

39:49.019 --> 39:51.120
Oh, uh...

39:53.289 --> 39:56.959
Here, I hope this helps.

39:58.361 --> 40:00.295
[mumbles]

40:00.330 --> 40:02.197
Trust me...

40:02.232 --> 40:04.800
Thank you. Thank you so much.

40:04.834 --> 40:06.235
Don't worry about it.

40:13.076 --> 40:16.945
So, you probably have
to get back home, huh?

40:16.980 --> 40:20.649
Folks probably wondering where you are.

40:22.652 --> 40:24.686
- My moms.
- What?

40:24.721 --> 40:27.623
My moms will be wondering where I am.

40:28.958 --> 40:30.692
Ok.

40:32.896 --> 40:34.730
Thanks again.

40:46.509 --> 40:48.944
[sighs] I'm going to make sure
this guy has a terrible night.

40:48.978 --> 40:50.712
Yeah, feel free.

40:50.747 --> 40:52.614
And, I'll get a ride back later.

40:52.649 --> 40:56.552
- All right.
- I'll... I'll see you at work tomorrow.

40:59.923 --> 41:01.790
I talked to Bill.

41:01.825 --> 41:03.892
He's going to make arrangements
to pick up the kids tomorrow.

41:03.927 --> 41:05.694
No, no, no. No.

41:05.728 --> 41:08.497
- What does that mean?
- That means that we are not sending these kids

41:08.531 --> 41:10.399
back into that system right now.

41:10.433 --> 41:11.567
All right? Not yet.

41:11.601 --> 41:14.770
Are you sure? We really
don't have the room.

41:16.906 --> 41:18.841
Then we'll make room.

41:18.875 --> 41:21.410
Ok, we'll make room.

41:24.614 --> 41:26.482
