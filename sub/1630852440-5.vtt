00:27.861 --> 00:31.197
<i>Okay.</i> <i>All right. We're having a good time.</i>

00:32.323 --> 00:34.242
<i>Okay. I'm pumped to be here.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:38.621
<i>Pumped to be here, pumped to be out</i>
<i>on the road, staying at hotels.</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:41.166
<i>It's fun. I'm back in a hotel.</i>
<i>And I love a hotel.</i>

00:41.249 --> 00:43.877
<i>Know what I mean?</i>
<i>But I don't always get the best hotels.</i>

00:43.960 --> 00:45.670
<i>I was at a hotel not too long ago,</i>

00:45.754 --> 00:47.839
<i>they had a sign</i>
<i>inside the room that said,</i>

00:47.922 --> 00:49.883
<i>"Not responsible for stolen items."</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:53.470
<i>So I took some stuff.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

00:54.929 --> 00:58.099
<i>I'm like, "I'm not responsible either.</i>
<i>I don't even work here."</i>

00:58.808 --> 01:01.811
<i>"Hell. I've been needing a lamp</i>
<i>with some plugs on it."</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:03.313
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

01:03.396 --> 01:05.732
<i>Tired of plugging my stuff</i>
<i>into a wall at home.</i>

01:05.815 --> 01:06.691
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:10.153
<i>It's tough to find a lamp</i>
<i>with USB ports on it. You know?</i>

01:10.820 --> 01:14.282
<i>When you find one, you take it.</i>
<i>That's what I always say. All right.</i>

01:14.365 --> 01:16.076
<i>Okay. We're having a good time.</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:20.371
<i>I like to tell people</i>
<i>we're having a good time, you know?</i>

01:20.455 --> 01:21.706
<i>I don't like to ask.</i>

01:22.874 --> 01:24.250
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

01:25.293 --> 01:28.338
<i>Lot of comics come out here.</i>
<i>They go, "Are we having a good time?"</i>

01:28.421 --> 01:30.924
<i>Not me. I can't risk it.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

01:31.716 --> 01:33.176
<i>You never know how it's gonna go.</i>

01:33.259 --> 01:35.929
<i>I like to tell you</i>
<i>that we're having a good time here.</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:37.889
<i>So I got a new TV.</i>

01:37.972 --> 01:40.892
<i>Recently I got a lamp,</i>
<i>I got a TV, and, uh…</i>

01:41.684 --> 01:43.645
<i>TV not from a hotel, and, uh…</i>

01:43.728 --> 01:47.357
<i>It had been a long time since I upgraded</i>
<i>and I wanted to get rid of the old one,</i>

01:47.440 --> 01:50.902
<i>but I didn't wanna throw it away</i>
<i>so I decided I'd take it to Goodwill.</i>

01:50.985 --> 01:53.363
<i>And I showed up</i>
<i>at Goodwill with this old TV,</i>

01:53.446 --> 01:55.365
<i>and the Goodwill guy was like, "Nah."</i>

01:56.741 --> 01:59.077
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"We don't take TVs like that anymore."</i>

02:00.161 --> 02:01.412
<i>But they did take it.</i>

02:02.080 --> 02:05.375
<i>Later that night when they were closed.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

02:06.709 --> 02:08.294
<i>Just drop that thing right off.</i>

02:08.878 --> 02:12.590
<i>I'm not getting rejected from Goodwill,</i>
<i>is what I'm telling you.</i>

02:12.674 --> 02:14.968
<i>Not today. Not any day. That's a gift.</i>

02:15.844 --> 02:17.220
<i>You don't turn down a gift.</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:21.432
<i>I didn't get my receipt. So I won't</i>
<i>be able to claim that on my taxes.</i>

02:23.184 --> 02:24.686
<i>It'll be a tough year.</i>

02:25.645 --> 02:28.398
<i>You ever do that? Drop off clothes</i>
<i>at Goodwill, they're like,</i>

02:28.481 --> 02:29.440
<i>"You want a receipt?"</i>

02:29.524 --> 02:32.360
<i>I'm like, "No. I don't want proof</i>
<i>I ever owned these clothes."</i>

02:33.027 --> 02:35.029
<i>It's like, "You see what I'm wearing."</i>

02:35.113 --> 02:37.740
<i>"Imagine what I'm giving away for free."</i>

02:38.658 --> 02:41.494
<i>"Imagine what I'm too good for."</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

02:41.578 --> 02:45.540
<i>Like, "I bought these clothes here</i>
<i>last year at this Goodwill."</i>

02:47.125 --> 02:48.501
<i>Okay? All right.</i>

02:49.335 --> 02:51.379
<i>I like to get picture frames at Goodwill.</i>

02:51.462 --> 02:53.381
<i>Sometimes you get a good deal on a frame.</i>

02:53.464 --> 02:56.467
<i>And sometimes you can get pictures</i>
<i>of other people's family.</i>

02:57.135 --> 02:58.761
<i>I don't know how that happens.</i>

02:58.845 --> 03:01.264
<i>People are like,</i>
<i>"Well, I'm done with this frame</i>

03:01.347 --> 03:02.515
<i>and this family."</i>

03:05.435 --> 03:06.895
<i>"Yeah, they mean a lot to me,</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:09.397
<i>but not enough</i>
<i>to bend a staple in the back."</i>

03:10.857 --> 03:12.567
<i>"Don't have that kind of time."</i>

03:13.067 --> 03:14.861
<i>"Can't be bending staples all day."</i>

03:14.944 --> 03:17.864
<i>Okay. We're having a good time. I, uh…</i>

03:19.449 --> 03:23.870
<i>I like to wave like this. I do this a lot.</i>
<i>I wave like this at the end of a joke,</i>

03:24.454 --> 03:26.372
<i>just to let you know that joke's over.</i>

03:27.832 --> 03:30.084
<i>Lot of times you'll know</i>
<i>'cause you'll be laughing.</i>

03:30.168 --> 03:32.503
<i>Other times</i>
<i>I'll have to give you one of these.</i>

03:33.254 --> 03:34.714
<i>I got a lot going on up here.</i>

03:34.797 --> 03:37.217
<i>I like to touch my hat,</i>
<i>my glasses, my belt.</i>

03:37.300 --> 03:39.761
<i>I'm like a third base coach</i>
<i>up here and, uh…</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:43.306
<i>Know what I mean?</i>
<i>Just trying to get you home.</i>

03:43.389 --> 03:44.557
<i>[scattered applause]</i>

03:44.641 --> 03:46.601
<i>Okay. We're having a good time.</i>

03:47.518 --> 03:48.645
<i>I do like this hat.</i>

03:48.728 --> 03:52.232
<i>I got this hat at Goodwill.</i>
<i>Not this one, but one like it. And, um…</i>

03:52.315 --> 03:54.192
<i>I like this hat 'cause it changes me.</i>

03:54.275 --> 03:57.862
<i>A lot of people don't know it changes me</i>
<i>'cause you haven't seen me without it.</i>

03:57.946 --> 04:00.698
<i>But if I take this hat off,</i>
<i>you're like, "Oh, man."</i>

04:00.782 --> 04:03.076
<i>"I bet that guy</i>
<i>likes rock music right there."</i>

04:04.327 --> 04:08.456
<i>Right? If I put this hat on, you're like,</i>
<i>"Nah. He's got a rock collection."</i>

04:11.751 --> 04:13.002
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:16.005
<i>[laughs] Okay.</i>
<i>If I take this hat off, you're like,</i>

04:16.089 --> 04:19.092
<i>"That guy looks like the lead singer</i>
<i>from the rock band Korn."</i>

04:19.550 --> 04:22.553
<i>I put this hat on,</i>
<i>you're like, "Nah. He grows corn."</i>

04:23.513 --> 04:25.473
<i>That's right. We're having a good time.</i>

04:26.683 --> 04:27.767
<i>[chuckles]</i>

04:27.850 --> 04:31.271
<i>If I take this hat off, you're like,</i>
<i>"I bet that guy smokes weed."</i>

04:31.354 --> 04:34.857
<i>I put this hat on, you're like,</i>
<i>"Nah. That guy </i>definitely<i> smokes weed."</i>

04:35.858 --> 04:37.986
<i>This hat can't change everything. It's…</i>

04:39.153 --> 04:40.530
<i>not a magic hat.</i>

04:41.322 --> 04:44.158
<i>How many people thought</i>
<i>my hair was attached to this hat?</i>

04:44.242 --> 04:47.662
<i>-[audience applauds and cheers]</i>
<i>-Yeah. All right.</i>

04:48.663 --> 04:51.332
<i>A lot of people think that,</i>
<i>a lot of people, actually.</i>

04:51.416 --> 04:53.668
<i>Lot of people tell me</i>
<i>I look like Forrest Gump</i>

04:53.751 --> 04:55.295
<i>after he ran for a long time.</i>

04:56.671 --> 04:59.424
<i>I wish that were a newer movie.</i>
<i>That would be a great joke.</i>

05:00.466 --> 05:02.593
<i>One guy commented</i>
<i>on a YouTube video I had.</i>

05:02.677 --> 05:05.388
<i>He said, "He looks like the guy</i>
<i>that comes out to say a prayer</i>

05:05.471 --> 05:07.098
<i>before the NASCAR race begins."</i>

05:10.476 --> 05:13.313
<i>I don't know what that means entirely,</i>
<i>but I will do it.</i>

05:15.106 --> 05:16.316
<i>I will do it.</i>

05:16.399 --> 05:19.485
<i>Well, my hair feels pretty good today</i>
<i>'cause I've been at a hotel.</i>

05:19.569 --> 05:23.239
<i>And when I'm at a hotel,</i>
<i>I use a lot of shampoo. Know what I mean?</i>

05:23.323 --> 05:26.034
<i>'Cause it's free and it's a good time.</i>

05:26.117 --> 05:28.244
<i>But, you know, I love a hotel.</i>

05:28.328 --> 05:30.538
<i>I like a hotel</i>
<i>that's a little shady though.</i>

05:30.621 --> 05:32.373
<i>Know what I mean? I like to fit in.</i>

05:33.875 --> 05:35.335
<i>I like to pull up out front,</i>

05:35.418 --> 05:37.587
<i>there'd be people there</i>
<i>smoking cigarettes.</i>

05:37.670 --> 05:39.797
<i>Like, I don't want</i>
<i>people OD'ing out front,</i>

05:40.590 --> 05:42.800
<i>but I would like them</i>
<i>to be doing some drugs.</i>

05:43.593 --> 05:46.804
<i>I like to walk by a room</i>
<i>and smell weed coming outta there.</i>

05:46.888 --> 05:49.307
<i>That way,</i>
<i>I know what's allowed. You know?</i>

05:49.807 --> 05:52.602
<i>That way, when the front desk</i>
<i>calls my room later and goes,</i>

05:52.685 --> 05:54.437
<i>"We smell weed," I go, "Me too."</i>

05:55.938 --> 05:59.275
<i>"Me too. Doesn't bother me,</i>
<i>but I appreciate you checking with me."</i>

06:02.487 --> 06:06.741
<i>"I'll let you know if I need anything,</i>
<i>but don't come up here. We're fine."</i>

06:07.742 --> 06:10.828
<i>I stayed at one hotel.</i>
<i>Nothing worked. The elevator didn't work.</i>

06:10.912 --> 06:13.289
<i>Finally got to my room</i>
<i>and the Wi-Fi didn't work.</i>

06:13.373 --> 06:15.875
<i>So I went downstairs.</i>
<i>Like, "The Wi-Fi doesn't work."</i>

06:15.958 --> 06:21.005
<i>He was like, "Yeah. It's a little shaky,</i>
<i>but the network name is 'Ramada Inn 1.'"</i>

06:21.089 --> 06:22.924
<i>That's when I realized why it was shaky.</i>

06:23.007 --> 06:25.426
<i>'Cause we weren't at a Ramada Inn.</i>

06:28.930 --> 06:31.808
<i>I could see the Ramada Inn</i>
<i>through the window.</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:37.563
<i>He was like,</i>
<i>"But it works good here in the lobby."</i>

06:37.647 --> 06:39.357
<i>"Why don't you just use it here?"</i>

06:39.440 --> 06:42.151
<i>I'm like, "Obviously you don't know</i>
<i>what I need Wi-Fi for."</i>

06:42.235 --> 06:44.737
<i>[audience groans and laughs]</i>

06:44.821 --> 06:47.448
<i>"I'm not working</i>
<i>on a spreadsheet up here, buddy."</i>

06:48.199 --> 06:49.992
<i>[scattered applause]</i>

06:50.076 --> 06:53.329
<i>Man, I'm stressed out.</i>
<i>You know what I mean? Okay.</i>

06:55.540 --> 06:57.041
<i>We're having a good time.</i>

06:57.542 --> 07:00.837
<i>You ever check into an old hotel</i>
<i>and plug your phone charger in the wall,</i>

07:00.920 --> 07:03.005
<i>and then it just falls out on the floor?</i>

07:04.382 --> 07:07.093
<i>So, what's going on</i>
<i>with those plugs? You know?</i>

07:07.176 --> 07:09.220
<i>Who's stretching out all the plugs?</i>

07:12.473 --> 07:14.934
<i>Know what I mean?</i>
<i>Why they all wore out like that?</i>

07:17.270 --> 07:19.647
<i>Who's got</i>
<i>these big phone chargers out here?</i>

07:20.314 --> 07:23.234
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>
<i>I got a regular-size phone charger.</i>

07:23.317 --> 07:25.194
<i>Now I'm not even making a connection.</i>

07:25.736 --> 07:28.156
<i>Walking around</i>
<i>with a half-charged phone all day.</i>

07:28.656 --> 07:32.160
<i>I'm just saying, don't stretch out</i>
<i>the plugs for everybody else.</i>

07:32.243 --> 07:34.454
<i>You may not be</i>
<i>the last one to use that plug.</i>

07:35.329 --> 07:37.457
<i>I like a snug plug. You know what I mean?</i>

07:37.540 --> 07:39.125
<i>[audience member laughs loudly]</i>

07:39.208 --> 07:41.711
<i>Yeah, okay. We're having a good time here.</i>

07:43.421 --> 07:45.256
<i>All right. We're having a good time.</i>

07:48.050 --> 07:51.345
<i>I stayed at a casino hotel one time.</i>
<i>I've stayed at a lot of hotels.</i>

07:51.429 --> 07:54.223
<i>I stayed at a casino hotel.</i>
<i>They had a sign in the room.</i>

07:54.307 --> 07:58.436
<i>Had a list of everything you could steal</i>
<i>and how much it cost. All right?</i>

07:58.519 --> 08:01.564
<i>That way, if you steal something,</i>
<i>they'll charge it to your account.</i>

08:01.647 --> 08:03.357
<i>I guess to keep you from stealing,</i>

08:03.441 --> 08:06.194
<i>but they had an ironing board</i>
<i>on there for like $20.</i>

08:07.612 --> 08:09.947
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"That seems like a good deal to me."</i>

08:11.240 --> 08:14.118
<i>I don't buy a lot of ironing boards,</i>
<i>so I don't know.</i>

08:14.202 --> 08:16.579
<i>But $20 seems cheap to me. Right?</i>

08:17.079 --> 08:20.500
<i>Plus, who's bold enough</i>
<i>to steal an ironing board from a hotel?</i>

08:21.334 --> 08:23.836
<i>A lamp? That's easy.</i>
<i>You just put that in your bag.</i>

08:23.920 --> 08:26.380
<i>You might not get the shade,</i>
<i>but you get the lamp.</i>

08:27.965 --> 08:31.761
<i>An ironing board? You're at check-out</i>
<i>like, "No. I had this when I came in."</i>

08:34.514 --> 08:36.432
<i>"Yeah. It does look a lot like yours,</i>

08:37.308 --> 08:39.852
<i>but I always carry</i>
<i>an ironing board with me."</i>

08:40.353 --> 08:42.813
<i>"Good thing</i>
<i>because there's not one in that room."</i>

08:45.983 --> 08:47.944
<i>"You can check. It ain't in there."</i>

08:48.444 --> 08:49.946
<i>I don't even know how to iron.</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:52.698
<i>This is the best I ever look.</i>
<i>Somebody ironed this for me.</i>

08:53.658 --> 08:55.409
<i>I know how it works. You know?</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:57.828
<i>You plug it into the lamp and then you…</i>

08:59.956 --> 09:02.792
<i>Do it like that,</i>
<i>but I can't get the wrinkles out.</i>

09:02.875 --> 09:05.086
<i>A lot of hotels</i>
<i>want you to be eco-friendly now.</i>

09:05.169 --> 09:08.839
<i>At least that's what they say, but they</i>
<i>just don't wanna wash your towels.</i>

09:09.632 --> 09:13.010
<i>That's what it's all about. They're like,</i>
<i>"Save the planet. Reuse a towel."</i>

09:13.094 --> 09:16.013
<i>And I don't mind reusing a towel.</i>
<i>I've been known to reuse a towel</i>

09:16.097 --> 09:19.350
<i>for so long that the smell</i>
<i>of the towel gets on my body.</i>

09:19.433 --> 09:20.810
<i>[audience groans]</i>

09:20.893 --> 09:23.854
<i>I gotta get back in the shower</i>
<i>just to wash the towel off.</i>

09:26.065 --> 09:28.901
<i>I'm just saying</i>
<i>I've been eco-friendly this whole time.</i>

09:29.527 --> 09:31.445
<i>People been calling me nasty.</i>

09:32.363 --> 09:35.658
<i>I love the word "nasty."</i>
<i>It's a fun word to me. I like it.</i>

09:35.741 --> 09:39.161
<i>'Cause if you really wanna call</i>
<i>somebody gross, call 'em "nasty." Right?</i>

09:39.245 --> 09:40.538
<i>Really hits 'em in a way.</i>

09:40.621 --> 09:43.666
<i>But weirdly,</i>
<i>"nasty" can be a compliment. You know?</i>

09:43.749 --> 09:45.001
<i>Depending on the setting.</i>

09:45.084 --> 09:48.462
<i>If you're in the bedroom and you call</i>
<i>somebody nasty, they could be into it.</i>

09:48.963 --> 09:50.214
<i>Yeah, like, "You nasty."</i>

09:51.924 --> 09:56.137
<i>It's weird to have a word that could call</i>
<i>somebody gross and also be a compliment.</i>

09:56.220 --> 09:58.180
<i>You know a word</i>
<i>that doesn't work like that?</i>

09:58.264 --> 09:59.223
<i>Disgusting.</i>

09:59.890 --> 10:01.309
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

10:02.643 --> 10:04.979
<i>You're in bed,</i>
<i>your wife's like, "Talk dirty to me."</i>

10:05.062 --> 10:07.023
<i>You're like, "You're disgusting."</i>

10:10.651 --> 10:12.778
<i>I know that won't work.</i>
<i>I used to drink a lot.</i>

10:12.862 --> 10:15.156
<i>I know that won't work.</i>
<i>I did used to drink a lot.</i>

10:15.239 --> 10:17.366
<i>Heavy drinker.</i>
<i>I quit drinking. I had to quit,</i>

10:17.450 --> 10:20.620
<i>'cause I used to black out all the time,</i>
<i>and nothing good ever happens</i>

10:20.703 --> 10:23.372
<i>when you black out.</i>
<i>No one's ever like, "You blacked out,</i>

10:23.456 --> 10:26.167
<i>but I appreciate you helping</i>
<i>with those taxes." [chuckles]</i>

10:29.045 --> 10:30.504
<i>I wasn't trying to black out.</i>

10:30.588 --> 10:32.715
<i>I was trying to carry</i>
<i>a three-beer-buzz all day</i>

10:32.798 --> 10:34.467
<i>and that's tough after 15 beers.</i>

10:36.469 --> 10:39.722
<i>After 15, the beer's not working.</i>
<i>You gotta switch to something heavier.</i>

10:39.805 --> 10:40.931
<i>You start doing shots.</i>

10:41.015 --> 10:44.435
<i>You do a couple shots, you slip</i>
<i>into what I like to call "the dark side."</i>

10:44.935 --> 10:47.104
<i>When your mind goes blank,</i>
<i>your eyes go dim,</i>

10:47.188 --> 10:49.440
<i>you tell people secrets</i>
<i>you didn't know you had.</i>

10:51.025 --> 10:53.527
<i>Blacking out's</i>
<i>like your mind's way of being like,</i>

10:53.611 --> 10:55.321
<i>"Nah, you don't need to see this."</i>

10:56.822 --> 10:59.033
<i>Your mind's like,</i>
<i>"I've lost control of the body,</i>

10:59.116 --> 11:01.827
<i>but I can keep you</i>
<i>from seeing what it's about to do."</i>

11:03.329 --> 11:05.331
<i>"You'll find out about it tomorrow."</i>

11:06.123 --> 11:07.208
<i>"At work."</i>

11:08.417 --> 11:10.002
<i>"If you still have a job."</i>

11:11.295 --> 11:14.048
<i>I used to black out a lot.</i>
<i>You get used to it. You know?</i>

11:14.131 --> 11:16.217
<i>But I remember</i>
<i>the first time was embarrassing.</i>

11:16.300 --> 11:19.053
<i>I had a friend call me the next day</i>
<i>like, "How you feeling?"</i>

11:19.136 --> 11:21.639
<i>I was like, "I dunno.</i>
<i>A little hungover, but good."</i>

11:21.722 --> 11:24.350
<i>He's like, "Let me tell you</i>
<i>what you told me last night."</i>

11:25.768 --> 11:28.145
<i>I'm like, "Dang, dude.</i>
<i>Don't tell me stuff like that."</i>

11:28.229 --> 11:30.439
<i>He's like,</i>
<i>"That's what I'm trying to tell you."</i>

11:30.940 --> 11:34.527
<i>But after a while, I got tough to it.</i>
<i>I just wake up, look at my phone, I go,</i>

11:34.610 --> 11:37.196
<i>"Well, I'll just delete</i>
<i>these people from my life."</i>

11:38.072 --> 11:39.490
<i>"I don't know how that happened,</i>

11:39.573 --> 11:42.410
<i>but it'd be easier to make new friends</i>
<i>than apologize for this."</i>

11:42.493 --> 11:44.578
<i>[several audience members laugh loudly]</i>

11:44.662 --> 11:46.539
<i>Couple people know what that's about.</i>

11:47.456 --> 11:49.792
<i>Not everybody's gonna relate to that.</i>
<i>I get it.</i>

11:50.668 --> 11:53.838
<i>I used to say things like, "Hey.</i>
<i>If they can't hang, they can't hang."</i>

11:53.921 --> 11:56.340
<i>If you don't wanna get kicked out</i>
<i>of Dillard's in the day,</i>

11:56.424 --> 11:57.508
<i>that's your business.</i>

11:59.009 --> 12:01.679
<i>Yeah. I wanna drink,</i>
<i>but I got some shopping to do.</i>

12:02.471 --> 12:05.015
<i>Gotta pick up some slacks.</i>
<i>I got a wedding to go to.</i>

12:05.725 --> 12:07.226
<i>If I'm still invited.</i>

12:07.852 --> 12:09.854
<i>I don't understand pants a lot of times.</i>

12:09.937 --> 12:13.566
<i>I don't even know what a slack is.</i>
<i>I never understood what khaki was.</i>

12:13.649 --> 12:16.152
<i>I had a friend. I said,</i>
<i>"What should I wear to your wedding?"</i>

12:16.235 --> 12:18.237
<i>He's like, "I don't know.</i>
<i>Just some khakis."</i>

12:18.320 --> 12:19.572
<i>I was like, "What color?"</i>

12:19.655 --> 12:21.991
<i>-[audience laughs]</i>
<i>-[scattered applause]</i>

12:22.616 --> 12:24.076
<i>You get what I'm saying.</i>

12:25.369 --> 12:27.830
<i>We're having a good time though,</i>
<i>know what I mean?</i>

12:28.831 --> 12:31.584
<i>I didn't get that khaki was a color.</i>
<i>That's the point.</i>

12:32.460 --> 12:34.795
<i>We're having a good time.</i>
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

12:34.879 --> 12:37.131
<i>Don't let it bother you.</i>
<i>We're having a good time.</i>

12:37.214 --> 12:39.049
<i>I used to drink and drive a lot.</i>

12:39.133 --> 12:41.969
<i>I'm not bragging about it,</i>
<i>but I was pretty good at it.</i>

12:42.720 --> 12:44.263
<i>You ever wake up driving?</i>

12:45.306 --> 12:48.809
<i>Like you been blacked out, then you</i>
<i>come to, like, "Dang. I'm driving."</i>

12:49.727 --> 12:51.312
<i>"How'd I get this drunk?"</i>

12:51.395 --> 12:52.730
<i>"Where am I going?"</i>

12:54.064 --> 12:56.484
<i>And I got a flat tire.</i>
<i>"I hope that flat tire's new."</i>

12:56.567 --> 12:58.569
<i>"I'm not trying to buy a rim out here."</i>

12:59.153 --> 13:01.989
<i>Pulled into a parking lot.</i>
<i>I was able to get the car jacked up.</i>

13:02.072 --> 13:05.451
<i>I got the flat tire off, but I couldn't</i>
<i>figure out how to get the spare on.</i>

13:05.534 --> 13:09.330
<i>So I called AAA. That guy showed up,</i>
<i>he was like, "Dang, you're drunk, man."</i>

13:09.413 --> 13:11.832
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"Yeah. Normally I can change a tire."</i>

13:13.751 --> 13:16.837
<i>"Plus, I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>I called AAA not AA. So…"</i>

13:20.591 --> 13:21.425
<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

13:21.926 --> 13:23.719
<i>[audience cheers and applauds]</i>

13:23.803 --> 13:24.678
<i>You get it.</i>

13:25.471 --> 13:27.181
<i>"If you wanna get this tire changed,</i>

13:27.264 --> 13:29.809
<i>get me back on the road,</i>
<i>I got somewhere to be."</i>

13:29.892 --> 13:32.895
<i>"Don't know where, but I'll figure it out</i>
<i>while you change the tire."</i>

13:32.978 --> 13:36.065
<i>"I don't need a sponsor yet.</i>
<i>I'll call you in a couple years."</i>

13:37.650 --> 13:39.693
<i>I did used to drink and drive a lot.</i>

13:39.777 --> 13:42.780
<i>I live in Tennessee. They say,</i>
<i>"Buzzed driving is drunk driving."</i>

13:42.863 --> 13:45.157
<i>So if you're gonna do it, get drunk.</i>

13:46.742 --> 13:49.537
<i>At least that way,</i>
<i>you can sleep when you get to jail.</i>

13:49.620 --> 13:51.956
<i>[scattered audience members laugh loudly]</i>

13:52.039 --> 13:53.833
<i>Know what I mean? They get it.</i>

13:54.333 --> 13:57.920
<i>I always say, "If you can get arrested</i>
<i>for four beers, why not have 14?"</i>

13:58.629 --> 14:01.298
<i>I don't make the laws.</i>
<i>I'm just trying to live within 'em.</i>

14:01.757 --> 14:04.510
<i>You only get two DUIs.</i>
<i>Don't waste one on a buzz.</i>

14:04.593 --> 14:06.679
<i>[audience laughs and groans]</i>

14:08.347 --> 14:10.683
<i>If you'll be driving a moped</i>
<i>for the next two years,</i>

14:10.766 --> 14:11.934
<i>have a story about it.</i>

14:13.769 --> 14:16.564
<i>But I'm not </i>for<i> drinking and driving.</i>
<i>People think I'm for it.</i>

14:16.647 --> 14:20.317
<i>I'm just saying, back when I was drinking</i>
<i>there was no Uber, no Lyft.</i>

14:20.401 --> 14:21.527
<i>Cabs weren't reliable.</i>

14:21.610 --> 14:24.405
<i>So if you wanted to drink,</i>
<i>you had to just drive, right?</i>

14:24.488 --> 14:26.448
<i>Sometimes we'd get a designated driver,</i>

14:26.532 --> 14:28.701
<i>but that didn't mean</i>
<i>they wasn't going to drink.</i>

14:31.245 --> 14:34.540
<i>That just meant you had someone</i>
<i>that was willing to risk it.</i>

14:37.001 --> 14:39.044
<i>That one friend with nothing to lose.</i>

14:39.837 --> 14:42.214
<i>He's like,</i>
<i>"I don't even have a driver's license."</i>

14:44.174 --> 14:47.052
<i>I never had a sober friend</i>
<i>that was willing to drive me around</i>

14:47.136 --> 14:48.721
<i>that I wanted to hang out with.</i>

14:50.347 --> 14:52.558
<i>I had friends like,</i>
<i>"I'll drive you to the bar."</i>

14:52.641 --> 14:55.352
<i>And I'm like,</i>
<i>"No. We're trying to have a good time."</i>

14:56.896 --> 15:00.024
<i>"I don't need your sober eyes</i>
<i>staring at me all night."</i>

15:00.941 --> 15:04.361
<i>I don't need someone hanging around</i>
<i>that's gonna remember everything.</i>

15:06.614 --> 15:09.950
<i>I grew up in Alabama. In Tennessee,</i>
<i>Alabama there's nowhere to walk to.</i>

15:10.034 --> 15:11.911
<i>You don't walk to the bar or home.</i>

15:11.994 --> 15:13.913
<i>You walk home</i>
<i>too late at night in Alabama,</i>

15:13.996 --> 15:16.165
<i>you might get hit by another drunk driver.</i>

15:18.125 --> 15:20.461
<i>Gotta stay safe, man.</i>
<i>Keep it behind the wheel.</i>

15:21.420 --> 15:23.130
<i>Okay, we're having a good time.</i>

15:23.213 --> 15:25.549
<i>[audience laughs and applauds]</i>

15:25.633 --> 15:28.469
<i>Okay. There's no subway</i>
<i>in Alabama, you know what I mean?</i>

15:28.552 --> 15:30.387
<i>Well, there is, but a sandwich shop.</i>

15:31.931 --> 15:33.641
<i>Okay. You get it. And, uh…</i>

15:34.558 --> 15:36.060
<i>We're having a good time here.</i>

15:36.644 --> 15:38.687
<i>I used to smoke a lot of cigarettes.</i>

15:38.771 --> 15:41.148
<i>I used to smoke so much</i>
<i>that my lungs would hurt,</i>

15:41.231 --> 15:43.734
<i>and then I would dip till my lungs healed.</i>

15:43.817 --> 15:46.070
<i>Then I would smoke</i>
<i>while my lip was healing.</i>

15:46.737 --> 15:49.448
<i>I never vaped.</i>
<i>I quit smoking before vape came around.</i>

15:49.531 --> 15:51.909
<i>For a while, there was</i>
<i>a lot of different vapes.</i>

15:51.992 --> 15:55.120
<i>There was a regular cigarette vape.</i>
<i>There was, like, a JUUL.</i>

15:55.204 --> 15:57.873
<i>And some people smoked</i>
<i>out of a walkie-talkie.</i>

16:01.293 --> 16:03.754
<i>Remember that?</i>
<i>They'd smoke out of the antenna.</i>

16:04.713 --> 16:07.633
<i>Even makes the same sound.</i>
<i>It's like… [mimics radio static]</i>

16:09.593 --> 16:12.346
<i>It's confusing if you have</i>
<i>a walkie-talkie </i>and<i> a vape.</i>

16:13.472 --> 16:16.100
<i>"Am I taking a hit</i>
<i>or am I getting a call right now?"</i>

16:17.309 --> 16:19.144
<i>They blow a lot of smoke too.</i>

16:19.228 --> 16:22.982
<i>I was sitting behind this guy in traffic,</i>
<i>I thought his truck was on fire.</i>

16:23.816 --> 16:28.904
<i>He was just sitting there vaping,</i>
<i>listening to heavy metal. [chuckles]</i>

16:28.988 --> 16:31.573
<i>I've never been a big heavy metal fan.</i>
<i>I like country music.</i>

16:31.657 --> 16:33.993
<i>-I'm a big country music fan.</i>
<i>-[scattered cheers]</i>

16:34.076 --> 16:37.079
<i>Okay. That sounds about right.</i>
<i>Was that four people? Perfect.</i>

16:37.162 --> 16:39.623
<i>All right. There it is. There they are.</i>

16:39.707 --> 16:41.125
<i>I love country. Right?</i>

16:41.208 --> 16:45.170
<i>A good country song can have</i>
<i>you reminiscing about times you never had.</i>

16:47.339 --> 16:49.216
<i>We weren't a lake family, growing up.</i>

16:49.299 --> 16:52.428
<i>We never went to the lake,</i>
<i>but I hear a country song about the lake,</i>

16:52.511 --> 16:54.096
<i>I'm like, "Yeah. I remember that."</i>

16:56.724 --> 16:59.643
<i>[scattered applause]</i>

16:59.727 --> 17:01.061
<i>That was a good time.</i>

17:01.729 --> 17:03.814
<i>We needed that 'cause we never traveled.</i>

17:03.897 --> 17:07.568
<i>I grew up in a trailer park in Alabama</i>
<i>and we had a pretty good time,</i>

17:07.651 --> 17:10.863
<i>but not sure why they call it a park.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

17:11.363 --> 17:13.490
<i>There wasn't no rides in there.</i>

17:13.574 --> 17:16.869
<i>No water slides.</i>
<i>We had an occasional slip-and-slide.</i>

17:16.952 --> 17:19.747
<i>Like an old tarp</i>
<i>with some Dawn dish detergent on it.</i>

17:21.123 --> 17:23.792
<i>We put our slip-and-slide</i>
<i>over a tree root one time.</i>

17:24.501 --> 17:26.503
<i>Yeah. 'Cause we was gonna jump it.</i>

17:27.046 --> 17:28.672
<i>That's not how that works.</i>

17:30.299 --> 17:33.761
<i>[sighs] At all. I hit that tree root,</i>
<i>I just got up and got a job.</i>

17:35.804 --> 17:37.556
<i>Like, "I am done playing out here."</i>

17:39.224 --> 17:42.186
<i>Hell, I'm done playing. Period.</i>
<i>I got medical bills now.</i>

17:43.520 --> 17:47.566
<i>I don't know if you've hit a tree root</i>
<i>going 70 miles an hour on your chest,</i>

17:47.649 --> 17:49.693
<i>with a smile on your face, but…</i>

17:50.360 --> 17:52.196
<i>it'll knock that smile off.</i>

17:53.530 --> 17:54.990
<i>I never went camping growing up</i>

17:55.074 --> 17:57.076
<i>'cause, like I said,</i>
<i>I grew up in a trailer,</i>

17:57.159 --> 17:59.495
<i>and we felt</i>
<i>like we had a pretty good idea…</i>

18:01.872 --> 18:03.248
<i>what camping was all about.</i>

18:03.332 --> 18:06.085
<i>We're like,</i>
<i>"No. We already kinda live in a camper."</i>

18:06.168 --> 18:08.629
<i>"We don't really need</i>
<i>to take it down to a tent."</i>

18:08.712 --> 18:11.381
<i>[inhales sharply]</i>
<i>"We know what it's like to be poor."</i>

18:11.465 --> 18:14.134
<i>"We're not trying to find out</i>
<i>what it means to be homeless."</i>

18:14.551 --> 18:17.179
<i>"We're not trying</i>
<i>to practice homelessness out here."</i>

18:18.347 --> 18:20.099
<i>A lot of people think I'm homeless.</i>

18:21.683 --> 18:23.852
<i>If I go to a city</i>
<i>with a lot of homeless people,</i>

18:23.936 --> 18:26.980
<i>and I'm hanging around outside,</i>
<i>people will think I'm homeless.</i>

18:27.064 --> 18:28.857
<i>It's happened quite a few times.</i>

18:29.399 --> 18:31.985
<i>One time I was in Austin, Texas</i>
<i>and I was outside.</i>

18:32.069 --> 18:35.155
<i>I was dressed like this.</i>
<i>You know, I was show-ready, and, uh--</i>

18:35.239 --> 18:37.699
<i>-[audience laughs]</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

18:38.951 --> 18:41.286
<i>I was sitting on this park bench,</i>
<i>looking down,</i>

18:41.370 --> 18:43.038
<i>and I heard someone say "excuse me."</i>

18:43.122 --> 18:45.374
<i>I looked up</i>
<i>and there was a little girl there</i>

18:45.457 --> 18:49.002
<i>with a brown paper sack in her hand,</i>
<i>and she said, "Do you want a sandwich?"</i>

18:49.086 --> 18:51.088
<i>-[audience] Aw!</i>
<i>-Yeah. It was very sweet.</i>

18:51.171 --> 18:52.965
<i>And I did want a sandwich, so…</i>

18:54.633 --> 18:56.885
<i>It worked out. You know what I mean?</i>

18:56.969 --> 18:59.096
<i>My stomach was full,</i>
<i>but my soul was empty.</i>

18:59.179 --> 19:00.139
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

19:00.222 --> 19:02.266
<i>I felt good, but not about myself.</i>

19:03.392 --> 19:06.520
<i>But I don't turn down a free sandwich.</i>
<i>I don't got that kind of money.</i>

19:06.603 --> 19:09.398
<i>I don't got the kind of money</i>
<i>that turns down a free sandwich.</i>

19:09.481 --> 19:12.568
<i>There's a lot of different kinds of money.</i>
<i>I learned that growing up.</i>

19:12.651 --> 19:16.613
<i>There's old money, new money,</i>
<i>blood money, drug money.</i>

19:16.697 --> 19:18.157
<i>We didn't have any of that.</i>

19:18.740 --> 19:20.659
<i>What we had was "good money." Right?</i>

19:20.742 --> 19:23.078
<i>Where your parents</i>
<i>buy you something you don't like,</i>

19:23.162 --> 19:25.122
<i>they go, "We paid good money for that."</i>

19:25.998 --> 19:27.499
<i>[scattered applause]</i>

19:29.459 --> 19:31.587
<i>Good money buys the worst stuff too.</i>

19:33.547 --> 19:34.798
<i>It's never anything good.</i>

19:34.882 --> 19:38.427
<i>Good money buys, like,</i>
<i>airbrushed T-shirts with your name on it.</i>

19:39.595 --> 19:41.388
<i>From Gatlinburg, Tennessee.</i>

19:43.432 --> 19:46.143
<i>I had a lot of T-shirts</i>
<i>with wolves on it, growing up.</i>

19:47.060 --> 19:49.479
<i>My mom thought</i>
<i>I'd look good in a wolf T-shirt.</i>

19:50.564 --> 19:53.859
<i>She's like, "The more wolves, the better.</i>
<i>Put them all over that thing."</i>

19:54.359 --> 19:57.487
<i>"Might put a little moon on there.</i>
<i>Give that wolf something to howl at."</i>

20:02.117 --> 20:05.454
<i>I had a hat, growing up.</i>
<i>Had my name airbrushed across the top.</i>

20:05.537 --> 20:07.497
<i>It just said "Dusty" right here.</i>

20:08.081 --> 20:10.083
<i>That's just so I wouldn't get kidnapped.</i>

20:11.084 --> 20:14.963
<i>Kidnapper sees that hat, he's like, "No.</i>
<i>His family ain't got no money. Just…"</i>

20:15.881 --> 20:17.466
<i>"Just give him the candy."</i>

20:18.800 --> 20:21.428
<i>"Hell, he probably ain't had candy</i>
<i>in a long time."</i>

20:23.597 --> 20:25.933
<i>I'm out there trying to get </i>in<i> the van.</i>

20:27.601 --> 20:29.645
<i>They're like, "No! No."</i>

20:29.728 --> 20:31.480
<i>"We are kidnappers."</i>

20:33.440 --> 20:35.525
<i>I'm like, "I know. I'm a kid."</i>

20:37.736 --> 20:39.488
<i>"Trying to get napped up in here."</i>

20:41.156 --> 20:43.408
<i>"Get me out of</i>
<i>this trailer park for a while."</i>

20:44.159 --> 20:46.870
<i>The worst thing, for me,</i>
<i>about living in a trailer park</i>

20:46.954 --> 20:50.374
<i>was having to write my address down</i>
<i>on anything in elementary school.</i>

20:50.457 --> 20:55.212
<i>'Cause I wasn't the poor kid till I had</i>
<i>to write, "Lot 8, Moore's Trailer Park"</i>

20:55.295 --> 20:56.755
<i>down on my school paperwork.</i>

20:56.838 --> 20:59.591
<i>All the other kids are like,</i>
<i>"Dusty, you live in a trailer?"</i>

20:59.675 --> 21:01.635
<i>"I don't know why you're so surprised."</i>

21:01.718 --> 21:04.930
<i>"I mean, my first name is 'Dusty,'</i>

21:06.640 --> 21:09.309
<i>and every day I come to school</i>
<i>in a NASCAR T-shirt."</i>

21:10.227 --> 21:12.854
<i>"And my backpack's</i>
<i>from the Marlboro catalog."</i>

21:14.898 --> 21:17.317
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>My parents finally smoked enough</i>

21:17.401 --> 21:19.236
<i>for me to start carrying some books.</i>

21:21.321 --> 21:24.741
<i>"Clear some of this smoke out,</i>
<i>I can get some reading done."</i>

21:25.826 --> 21:28.036
<i>That's how we did</i>
<i>our Christmas shopping.</i>

21:28.120 --> 21:30.580
<i>My mom handed me a Marlboro catalog,</i>

21:30.664 --> 21:32.541
<i>I circled what I wanted,</i>

21:32.624 --> 21:34.126
<i>she started smoking.</i>

21:37.587 --> 21:39.214
<i>She's like, "I'll get it."</i>

21:40.090 --> 21:41.049
<i>"I'll get it."</i>

21:41.925 --> 21:43.927
<i>[mimics coughing] "I'll get it."</i>

21:45.429 --> 21:47.097
<i>You can't get stuff like that now.</i>

21:47.180 --> 21:49.349
<i>Nowadays, they don't</i>
<i>reward you for smoking.</i>

21:51.852 --> 21:55.188
<i>It's a real shame. You gotta find it</i>
<i>at a flea market or something.</i>

21:55.272 --> 21:57.482
<i>-I love a good flea market.</i>
<i>-[scattered cheers]</i>

21:57.566 --> 21:59.693
<i>Any time I see one, I go there. I love it.</i>

21:59.776 --> 22:03.572
<i>I was in one not too long ago</i>
<i>and this lady had this great deal on DVDs.</i>

22:03.655 --> 22:05.240
<i>And I love DVDs. Right?</i>

22:05.324 --> 22:08.827
<i>I like to be about a decade</i>
<i>behind everybody else. You know?</i>

22:08.910 --> 22:13.457
<i>So I'm just now getting into 'em.</i>
<i>And it's a good time 'cause they're cheap.</i>

22:13.540 --> 22:17.002
<i>This lady had a great deal.</i>
<i>She had three DVDs for five dollars.</i>

22:17.085 --> 22:20.339
<i>I'm like, "That's a good deal."</i>
<i>So I'm gonna get six of these.</i>

22:20.422 --> 22:22.549
<i>That way, I can get six for ten. You know?</i>

22:22.632 --> 22:24.968
<i>Three for five, two times.</i>

22:26.553 --> 22:27.846
<i>Pretty easy. Right?</i>

22:27.929 --> 22:30.265
<i>But this lady</i>
<i>couldn't understand her own deal.</i>

22:31.433 --> 22:34.269
<i>I went up to her like,</i>
<i>"Hey. I'd like to get these DVDs."</i>

22:34.353 --> 22:37.064
<i>She goes, "How many you got there?"</i>
<i>I said, "Six."</i>

22:37.147 --> 22:39.608
<i>She said, "You know</i>
<i>it's three for five, right?"</i>

22:40.359 --> 22:41.526
<i>I was like, "Yeah."</i>

22:43.028 --> 22:44.154
<i>"Six for ten."</i>

22:45.864 --> 22:48.700
<i>She goes, "Well… I guess."</i>

22:49.409 --> 22:51.411
<i>[audience laughs and applauds]</i>

22:55.082 --> 22:56.208
<i>[sighs]</i>

22:56.875 --> 22:59.336
<i>I didn't know what to say. [chuckles]</i>

23:00.462 --> 23:02.672
<i>I didn't want her</i>
<i>to think I was ripping her off.</i>

23:02.756 --> 23:06.676
<i>So I was like, "No. This is your deal.</i>
<i>It's just three for five, two times."</i>

23:07.302 --> 23:09.554
<i>So I figure it's settled, right?</i>
<i>Easy mistake.</i>

23:09.638 --> 23:11.306
<i>Now I'm getting it for ten bucks.</i>

23:11.390 --> 23:14.559
<i>But then I hear her</i>
<i>back there doing math. Right?</i>

23:14.643 --> 23:17.979
<i>I'm not making this up.</i>
<i>She going… [whispers indistinctly]</i>

23:19.106 --> 23:22.025
<i>Then she closed her eyes,</i>
<i>she goes… [continues whispering]</i>

23:24.111 --> 23:26.071
<i>She goes, "All right. That'll be $15."</i>

23:27.572 --> 23:30.742
<i>I was like, "Listen,</i>
<i>I'm not even trying to bargain with you."</i>

23:30.826 --> 23:32.160
<i>"This is your deal."</i>

23:32.244 --> 23:34.496
<i>"It's just three for five, two times."</i>

23:34.579 --> 23:38.458
<i>"If you want, I'll buy these three</i>
<i>and then I'll take off this hat…</i>

23:41.711 --> 23:43.338
<i>and I'll buy these other three."</i>

23:44.506 --> 23:46.466
<i>And that worked. You know what I mean?</i>

23:47.843 --> 23:50.637
<i>It worked. Okay. We're having a good time.</i>

23:50.720 --> 23:52.556
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

23:52.639 --> 23:55.267
<i>You ever go to a retail place</i>
<i>and you pay with cash,</i>

23:55.350 --> 23:58.145
<i>they pull out the counterfeit pen,</i>
<i>start marking all your money,</i>

23:58.228 --> 24:00.856
<i>and then when they give you change,</i>
<i>they give you back cash?</i>

24:00.939 --> 24:03.692
<i>I'm always like,</i>
<i>"Let me hold on to that pen for a second."</i>

24:04.734 --> 24:07.195
<i>"You don't trust me, I don't trust you."</i>

24:09.656 --> 24:12.159
<i>"Yeah, I know it's a one."</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

24:13.410 --> 24:16.246
<i>Trying to roll around</i>
<i>out here with counterfeit ones?</i>

24:18.331 --> 24:19.624
<i>We're having a good time.</i>

24:20.417 --> 24:22.878
<i>I did wear</i>
<i>a lot of NASCAR T-shirts, growing up.</i>

24:22.961 --> 24:26.423
<i>There's nothing wrong with wearing</i>
<i>a NASCAR T-shirt but I wore so many</i>

24:26.506 --> 24:28.425
<i>that any time that I had to dress nice,</i>

24:28.508 --> 24:31.595
<i>my mom would just put me</i>
<i>in my newest NASCAR T-shirt.</i>

24:32.262 --> 24:35.140
<i>I'd be like, "This ain't that nice."</i>
<i>She's like, "I know."</i>

24:36.099 --> 24:37.058
<i>"Tuck it in."</i>

24:39.019 --> 24:40.604
<i>'Cause that changes everything.</i>

24:40.687 --> 24:43.815
<i>You go from working on the car</i>
<i>to church just by tucking it in.</i>

24:44.357 --> 24:47.569
<i>My dad still does that.</i>
<i>He tucks his shirts in tight too.</i>

24:47.652 --> 24:50.614
<i>Real tight.</i>
<i>He'd make a V-neck out of a turtleneck.</i>

24:50.697 --> 24:51.781
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

24:52.949 --> 24:55.410
<i>Got T-shirt coming out</i>
<i>the bottom of his jeans.</i>

24:56.745 --> 24:58.914
<i>Seeing chest hair through the shirt.</i>

24:59.831 --> 25:01.917
<i>My dad's a big University of Alabama fan.</i>

25:02.000 --> 25:05.003
<i>He tucks his shirts in so tight,</i>
<i>all you see is "University."</i>

25:08.298 --> 25:09.925
<i>Like he's just </i>for<i> college.</i>

25:11.468 --> 25:12.969
<i>But he's not for college though.</i>

25:13.053 --> 25:15.180
<i>My dad made fun of me</i>
<i>for reading one time.</i>

25:16.223 --> 25:19.142
<i>Like, not how I was reading,</i>
<i>because I was doing it.</i>

25:19.643 --> 25:22.479
<i>He was like,</i>
<i>"No son of mine's gonna be reading books."</i>

25:22.562 --> 25:23.813
<i>So I quit.</i>

25:25.649 --> 25:27.359
<i>Got into drugs. You know?</i>

25:27.442 --> 25:30.737
<i>-[audience laughs loudly]</i>
<i>-Okay. We're having a good time.</i>

25:30.820 --> 25:34.824
<i>I never went to college. I don't know</i>
<i>if you put that together already, but, uh…</i>

25:34.908 --> 25:36.743
<i>I never went 'cause I had to pay for it.</i>

25:36.826 --> 25:39.412
<i>I felt like at 18,</i>
<i>if I had enough money for college,</i>

25:39.496 --> 25:41.915
<i>I was probably doing</i>
<i>all right already and, uh…</i>

25:41.998 --> 25:43.792
<i>But we don't need it for everything.</i>

25:43.875 --> 25:46.795
<i>I didn't know what I wanted to do,</i>
<i>but figured we don't need it.</i>

25:46.878 --> 25:49.714
<i>If you wanna be a doctor, lawyer,</i>
<i>obviously go to college,</i>

25:49.798 --> 25:51.925
<i>but building roads, building houses,</i>

25:52.008 --> 25:54.344
<i>we don't need college.</i>
<i>We'll figure it out. Right?</i>

25:54.427 --> 25:57.305
<i>Abraham Lincoln built a house.</i>
<i>Did he go to college?</i>

25:57.389 --> 25:58.306
<i>I don't know.</i>

26:00.016 --> 26:03.228
<i>I don't know. Not even sure</i>
<i>he built a house, to be honest with you.</i>

26:04.020 --> 26:05.605
<i>That's just a thing people say.</i>

26:06.481 --> 26:08.483
<i>And they named the logs after him.</i>

26:10.151 --> 26:11.987
<i>Know what I mean? You get it.</i>

26:12.070 --> 26:13.863
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

26:13.947 --> 26:15.490
<i>We're having a good time.</i>

26:17.158 --> 26:19.953
<i>The thing that was most fun for me</i>
<i>about living in a trailer…</i>

26:20.036 --> 26:21.538
<i>The most fun was tornadoes.</i>

26:21.621 --> 26:23.873
<i>Right? 'Cause I got to leave.</i>

26:25.792 --> 26:28.920
<i>Got to go to a real house for a while.</i>
<i>I loved going to a real house.</i>

26:29.004 --> 26:31.047
<i>I'd be like, "Look at all these bricks."</i>

26:31.756 --> 26:34.718
<i>Only time I ever seen a brick</i>
<i>is when it came through my window</i>

26:34.801 --> 26:35.885
<i>with a note on it.</i>

26:36.386 --> 26:37.762
<i>Said, "Cut your grass."</i>

26:40.056 --> 26:43.018
<i>That's how they do it</i>
<i>in the Mobile Homeowners Association.</i>

26:44.436 --> 26:45.979
<i>We're having a good time.</i>

26:47.522 --> 26:49.190
<i>I live in Nashville, Tennessee, now.</i>

26:49.274 --> 26:51.401
<i>And one December we had a tornado warning.</i>

26:51.484 --> 26:54.404
<i>I was listening to the radio,</i>
<i>and they were telling us what to do</i>

26:54.487 --> 26:57.616
<i>during this tornado warning</i>
<i>based on what kind of house you live in.</i>

26:57.699 --> 27:01.077
<i>Like, "If you live in a house</i>
<i>with a basement, go to the basement."</i>

27:01.161 --> 27:04.831
<i>"If you live in a house with no basement,</i>
<i>go into a bathroom or a small room."</i>

27:04.914 --> 27:07.125
<i>And they're like,</i>
<i>"If you live in a trailer park,</i>

27:07.208 --> 27:13.423
<i>we want you to go to a neighbor's house,</i>
<i>or go outside and lay down in the ditch."</i>

27:19.137 --> 27:20.764
<i>Yeah. That's the real news.</i>

27:21.389 --> 27:23.850
<i>They're like,</i>
<i>"Listen. We don't know what to tell you."</i>

27:24.684 --> 27:27.395
<i>"Hell, you made</i>
<i>some bad decisions along the way."</i>

27:28.438 --> 27:31.483
<i>"Now you gotta deal with this.</i>
<i>We can't help you."</i>

27:31.566 --> 27:34.486
<i>They're like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, I know it's raining out there</i>

27:34.569 --> 27:36.696
<i>and that ditch is gonna be full of water."</i>

27:38.156 --> 27:39.532
<i>"Just get down in it."</i>

27:41.743 --> 27:43.995
<i>"Yeah. It's December. It's gonna be cold."</i>

27:44.829 --> 27:47.666
<i>"You're probably gonna get sick.</i>
<i>Just get down in there."</i>

27:50.335 --> 27:53.046
<i>"Listen. We know</i>
<i>you won't have a radio out there."</i>

27:53.129 --> 27:55.006
<i>"You won't know when this warning's over,</i>

27:55.090 --> 27:57.759
<i>but just stay there</i>
<i>till it quits raining I guess."</i>

27:57.842 --> 27:59.886
<i>"And just get down in there."</i>

28:01.346 --> 28:04.933
<i>I like that the other option they give you</i>
<i>is go to a neighbor's house.</i>

28:05.016 --> 28:07.394
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what trailer parks they know about,</i>

28:08.520 --> 28:12.732
<i>but every trailer park I ever lived in,</i>
<i>my neighbor also lived in a trailer.</i>

28:14.234 --> 28:16.528
<i>It's like they just want us</i>
<i>to meet up in one.</i>

28:17.362 --> 28:18.863
<i>Maybe weight it down.</i>

28:20.907 --> 28:22.659
<i>And if we did have house neighbors,</i>

28:22.742 --> 28:25.328
<i>they're not so inviting</i>
<i>to the trailer park people.</i>

28:25.412 --> 28:28.123
<i>They're not like,</i>
<i>"Come on in and check out our stuff."</i>

28:28.206 --> 28:30.709
<i>"Tornado doesn't get it,</i>
<i>you can get it next week."</i>

28:32.502 --> 28:35.922
<i>Type of people that want you to take</i>
<i>your shoes off before you come in.</i>

28:36.005 --> 28:39.968
<i>Show up at somebody's house they're like,</i>
<i>"Come in. Mind taking off your shoes?"</i>

28:40.051 --> 28:41.803
<i>I'm like, "Nah, I'll just go home."</i>

28:43.388 --> 28:46.641
<i>"I wish you told me on the phone.</i>
<i>I wouldn't even have come over."</i>

28:48.560 --> 28:52.188
<i>Got me lounging around in my socks</i>
<i>like we're about to do yoga in here.</i>

28:52.772 --> 28:55.650
<i>They're like, "Namaste."</i>
<i>I'm like, "Nah-I'm-gon'-leave."</i>

28:57.235 --> 29:00.363
<i>"Let me get out of here."</i>
<i>But we weren't real poor, growing up.</i>

29:00.447 --> 29:03.950
<i>We just didn't have everything.</i>
<i>I never got ice cream, growing up.</i>

29:04.033 --> 29:06.536
<i>My mom used to just pour milk into a bowl,</i>

29:06.619 --> 29:08.955
<i>then she'd call me</i>
<i>into the room and go, "Well…</i>

29:09.539 --> 29:10.498
<i>you're too late."</i>

29:12.542 --> 29:14.544
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

29:16.755 --> 29:19.632
<i>It's like, "I guess you'll come</i>
<i>next time I call you."</i>

29:20.884 --> 29:22.719
<i>"Don't go laying down in the ditch."</i>

29:24.053 --> 29:26.765
<i>"Messing up that new wolf shirt</i>
<i>I got you out there."</i>

29:27.348 --> 29:29.058
<i>"Paid good money for that thing."</i>

29:30.769 --> 29:32.854
<i>My parents got divorced when I was two.</i>

29:32.937 --> 29:36.024
<i>Uh, then there was a custody battle</i>
<i>and my mom lost.</i>

29:36.107 --> 29:38.485
<i>So I had to go live with her, and, uh…</i>

29:40.653 --> 29:42.697
<i>-[audience applauds]</i>
<i>-That's true. And…</i>

29:42.781 --> 29:45.450
<i>We're having a good time.</i>
<i>This guy likes it. And, uh…</i>

29:45.533 --> 29:46.785
<i>We're having a good time.</i>

29:46.868 --> 29:49.370
<i>Parents are different today</i>
<i>than when I was growing up.</i>

29:49.454 --> 29:51.456
<i>Especially when it comes to pets, right?</i>

29:51.539 --> 29:55.168
<i>Today you might hear parents say,</i>
<i>"We gotta take our cat to the vet."</i>

29:55.251 --> 29:58.880
<i>When I was growing up, my dad'd be like,</i>
<i>"We don't have a cat anymore."</i>

29:59.839 --> 30:01.299
<i>And that cat was gone.</i>

30:01.883 --> 30:05.720
<i>I couldn't even get mad about it.</i>
<i>I'd just say, "I hope we get another one."</i>

30:06.221 --> 30:08.264
<i>He's like, "We'll see what wanders up."</i>

30:10.266 --> 30:13.478
<i>'Cause we didn't have real pets.</i>
<i>We just had prisoners of nature.</i>

30:15.563 --> 30:18.900
<i>A dog would wander up,</i>
<i>we'd chain him to a tree. Right?</i>

30:19.818 --> 30:21.069
<i>There we go.</i>

30:26.825 --> 30:29.911
<i>We had the meanest cat</i>
<i>you ever seen for about two weeks.</i>

30:29.994 --> 30:31.538

<i>[audience gasps and laughs]</i>

<i>I told you we weren't readers. And, uh,</i>

<i>there wasn't no Internet back then.</i>
<i>We just thought it was a weird breed.</i>

30:41.631 --> 30:42.966
<i>You ever seen a possum?</i>

30:43.049 --> 30:45.301
<i>You're not supposed to see 'em,</i>
<i>I don't think.</i>

30:46.678 --> 30:48.930
<i>They're definitely designed for the night.</i>

30:50.473 --> 30:54.435
<i>Every possum I've ever seen alive,</i>
<i>we made eye contact with each other.</i>

30:55.144 --> 30:57.272
<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>that possum's saying to me,</i>

30:57.355 --> 30:59.482
<i>"You're not supposed</i>
<i>to be out here right now."</i>

31:00.108 --> 31:02.235
<i>"Okay. I didn't choose to look like this."</i>

31:02.902 --> 31:03.987
<i>"This is my time."</i>

31:05.071 --> 31:07.532
<i>"I'm out here</i>
<i>eating your trash right now."</i>

31:07.615 --> 31:09.784
<i>"Least you could do</i>
<i>is give me a little privacy."</i>

31:10.535 --> 31:12.120
<i>You ever go to somebody's house</i>

31:12.203 --> 31:15.456
<i>and they got a dog</i>
<i>that's barking at you, growling at you,</i>

31:15.540 --> 31:17.375
<i>and they go, "Ah, he won't bite"?</i>

31:18.126 --> 31:19.919
<i>It's like, "Why you think that?"</i>

31:20.920 --> 31:24.340
<i>"'Cause he's never done it before?</i>
<i>Well, maybe today is the day."</i>

31:25.717 --> 31:27.719
<i>"'Cause he looks like he wants to bite."</i>

31:27.802 --> 31:31.306
<i>They're always like,</i>
<i>"Well, he might lick you to death."</i>

31:31.389 --> 31:32.640
<i>I'm like, "Death?"</i>

31:34.475 --> 31:36.144
<i>"Who said anything about dying?"</i>

31:37.020 --> 31:40.899
<i>"I'm just worried about being bitten.</i>
<i>I don't know why you brought up death."</i>

31:41.566 --> 31:45.278
<i>I just think it's a weird idea 'cause</i>
<i>the dog looks like it wants to bite you.</i>

31:45.361 --> 31:48.948
<i>It's like you show up at somebody's house</i>
<i>and there's some guy with a knife.</i>

31:49.073 --> 31:50.700
<i>He's just doing like this.</i>

31:52.952 --> 31:54.996
<i>"Huh? Huh!"</i>

31:56.122 --> 31:56.956
<i>"Huh?"</i>

31:57.707 --> 31:58.583
<i>"Huh?"</i>

31:59.208 --> 32:01.669
<i>And they're like, "Ah, he won't stab you."</i>

32:01.753 --> 32:03.588
<i>[audience laughs]</i>

32:05.840 --> 32:08.176

32:10.428 --> 32:12.430
<i>"Yeah. He'll settle down in a minute."</i>

32:13.890 --> 32:16.059
<i>"He's just not used</i>
<i>to being around people."</i>

32:17.560 --> 32:20.563
