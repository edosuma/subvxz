00:02.503 --> 00:04.336
(Tennessee Ernie Ford's
"Shenandoah" playing)

00:06.374 --> 00:09.875
¶ Oh, Shenandoah ¶

00:09.877 --> 00:17.216
¶ I hear you calling ¶

00:17.218 --> 00:21.153
¶ Hi-o ¶

00:21.155 --> 00:27.126
(thunder crashes)
¶ You rolling river ¶

00:27.128 --> 00:30.062
¶ Oh, Shenandoah ¶

00:30.064 --> 00:32.998
(patriotic music plays)

00:33.000 --> 00:34.833
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

00:34.835 --> 00:36.735
(static)

00:36.737 --> 00:39.505
(high-pitched tone playing)

00:39.507 --> 00:44.476
¶ She's a mighty river ¶

00:44.478 --> 00:48.714
¶ Hi-o ¶

00:48.716 --> 00:54.887
¶ You rolling river ¶

00:54.889 --> 00:56.855
(thunder crashes)

00:56.857 --> 01:00.359
¶ When she rolls down ¶

01:00.361 --> 01:05.864
¶ Her topsails shiver ¶

01:05.866 --> 01:08.767
(rattling)

01:12.073 --> 01:15.507
(clanking)

01:15.509 --> 01:18.243
(thunder crashes)

01:32.093 --> 01:35.094
(wind howling)

01:44.305 --> 01:46.305
(thunder crashes)

01:46.307 --> 01:47.606
(glass shatters)

01:47.608 --> 01:48.807
(shing!)

01:48.809 --> 01:50.542
(rattling)

01:53.581 --> 01:54.913
(growls)

01:54.915 --> 01:57.116
Stan, don't!
It's me -- Principal Lewis!

01:57.118 --> 01:58.250
Where's my family?!

01:58.252 --> 02:00.119
I don't know where they are.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.721
I swear!
To the old Gods and the new!

02:02.723 --> 02:05.157
(fire crackling)

02:05.159 --> 02:07.459
Fire's a bad idea.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.894
Relax, Stan.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.829
There's two of us,
and it's nice and warm.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.598
Your clothes
are soaked through.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.966
You need to dry 'em out.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.670
(thunder crashes)

02:18.672 --> 02:21.673
Ooh, sexy.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.912
(thunder crashes)

02:26.914 --> 02:29.948
If you weren't here with
your family, where were you?

02:29.950 --> 02:32.417
You know,
when the blast happened?

02:32.419 --> 02:35.154
On a mission.
South America.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.156
(whistles)
That's a long walk.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.625
You run into the Two Hundred
out there?

02:39.627 --> 02:41.026
I hear they're brutal.

02:41.028 --> 02:44.530
No, but I've seen
what they've done.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.966
Cool. Hey, you, uh, seems
like a lot of people

02:47.968 --> 02:50.702
are doing that thing
where they eat other people.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.504
(laughing)
I mean, isn't that wild?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.439
But also maybe
understandable, hmm?

02:54.441 --> 02:57.376
You, uh, done any of that?

02:57.378 --> 02:58.377
Nope.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.546
(laughs) Me neither!

03:00.548 --> 03:02.281
You passed my test!

03:02.283 --> 03:04.483
Now I feel
like I can relax.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.751
Look out!

03:07.721 --> 03:10.355
I thought I saw
a murderous road bandit,

03:10.357 --> 03:11.790
but it was just a moth.

03:11.792 --> 03:17.029
So tell me, what's your
feeling about tattoos?

03:17.031 --> 03:19.231
They should be covered
in the workplace.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.632
Come on, Stan!

03:20.634 --> 03:22.834
And what's with
that huge-ass hummingbird?

03:22.836 --> 03:24.503
It's a falcon.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.005
It was the end
of fishing season.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.041
And the sun.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.810
I can remember how warm
it felt on my face.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.213
Aah!
My face is so hot!

03:34.215 --> 03:36.381
Why don't you wear
a hat?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.816
Great idea, Hayley.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.519
Maybe don't look directly
at the sun.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.854
Oh, you'd just love for me
to miss another eclipse.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.190
Why did you want to come
on this trip so bad again?

03:45.192 --> 03:48.327
Yeah, don't you have,
like, a moral objection

03:48.329 --> 03:50.028
to fishing or something?

03:50.030 --> 03:54.633
Oh, my God, can I stop myself?

03:56.370 --> 03:59.104
(falcon shrieks)

03:59.106 --> 04:01.240
This is nice.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.774
You know,
I asked to come along

04:02.776 --> 04:05.210
because, well, it's actually
pretty rare that we --

04:05.212 --> 04:07.045
Talk quieter.
You're scaring the fish.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.580
-it's just rare that --
-Quieter.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.048
-it's so rare --
-Too quiet!

04:10.050 --> 04:12.417
It sounds like you're
conspiring against the fish.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.919
You're making them
paranoid!

04:13.921 --> 04:16.054
I was saying we never spend
any time together!

04:16.056 --> 04:17.623
Well, they're
definitely gone now!

04:17.625 --> 04:19.057
First you eat all my drivin'
pickles on the way up,

04:19.059 --> 04:20.592
and now this!

04:20.594 --> 04:22.628
Wasn't there some sort of
protest you could have gone to

04:22.630 --> 04:24.029
instead of ruining
my fishing trip?!

04:24.031 --> 04:25.297
A protest?

04:25.299 --> 04:27.599
How 'bout I do a protest
right here?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.901
Live free!

04:29.903 --> 04:31.236
(falcon shrieks)

04:31.238 --> 04:33.972
Whoa.
Well, you live free!

04:33.974 --> 04:35.741
(falcon shrieks)

04:35.743 --> 04:38.610
This one, though,
definitely lives free.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.912
(falcon shrieks)

04:40.914 --> 04:43.048
WOMAN ON RADIO:
<i> ...Considered overbudget.</i>

04:43.050 --> 04:45.250
<i> Still, the LQL insists</i>
<i> that Langley Falls'</i>

04:45.252 --> 04:48.120
<i> very own Hadron Collider</i>
<i>will meet its opening deadline.</i>

04:50.891 --> 04:53.091
Shut up, Klaus!

04:53.093 --> 04:55.661
(thunder crashes)

04:55.663 --> 04:59.765
All she wanted was to spend
a little time together.

04:59.767 --> 05:00.966
I was a fool.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.302
So you got the tattoo...

05:03.304 --> 05:04.836
As penance.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.606
And a reminder of what
I'd try to do differently,

05:07.608 --> 05:10.442
if I'm ever lucky enough
to see my family again.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.944
Fire's dying down.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.413
All this talk of fish.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.948
I never touched the stuff
before the blast,

05:16.950 --> 05:18.617
but now
I'd kill for one.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.453
Man, I'd eat those worms
if they were here right now.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.688
(laughs)

05:22.690 --> 05:25.023
It's amazing the things
you'll eat...

05:25.025 --> 05:27.092
If you get hungry enough.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.327
(thunder rumbles)

05:28.329 --> 05:30.162
I'm not a killer, Stan.

05:30.164 --> 05:31.930
I just want a slice.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.765
Hyah!

05:33.767 --> 05:35.167
(grunting)

05:35.169 --> 05:36.335
(glass shatters)

05:36.337 --> 05:37.536
LEWIS: Did I get ya?

05:37.538 --> 05:38.770
Ya gotta say something
if I gotcha!

05:38.772 --> 05:41.707
Them's
apocalypse rules!

05:41.709 --> 05:43.542
Stan, I thought
that was you!

05:43.544 --> 05:44.876
Aah! Quiet, Greg!

05:44.878 --> 05:46.111
I was looking out
my basement window...

05:46.113 --> 05:48.146
-Shh.
-...and I said to myself,

05:48.148 --> 05:49.981
'cause that's who
I talk to these days.
You have to stop talking.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.283
I said, "I think
that's Stan Smith."
Please shut up!

05:51.285 --> 05:52.551
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again

05:52.553 --> 05:54.786
after your family left.
-Be quiet!

05:54.788 --> 05:56.121
You have a lot of tattoos.
Wait, what? Do you know
where my family went?

05:56.123 --> 05:58.056
Oh, yeah. But we shouldn't
talk out in the open

05:58.058 --> 06:00.058
because Principal Lewis
has been prowling around,

06:00.060 --> 06:02.294
and you would not believe
what he's been getting up to.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.997
All I wanted was a taste!

06:05.999 --> 06:08.100
We're cool now!
So be cool!

06:10.170 --> 06:12.938
I can't look.
Did he get me?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.377
Last I saw Francine
and the kids,

06:18.379 --> 06:20.045
they were leaving
for the New Haven.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.747
-in Connecticut?
-No.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.749
The New Haven is a safe zone
a hundred miles west of here.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.017
If they were
in New Haven, Connecticut,

06:26.019 --> 06:28.086
they'd be dead already...
Of boredom!

06:28.088 --> 06:29.688
J.K.
I've never been there.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.056
I just think it's more
important now than ever

06:31.058 --> 06:32.524
to try to laugh.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.493
What's this tattoo here?
Looks like a doily.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.894
I don't want
to talk about it.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.029
Okay.
I'm feeling pretty weak.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.198
Maybe I'll just
sleep a little.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.567
It was
a particularly warm June.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.737
I can still recall the light,
sweet smell of Jasmine

06:45.739 --> 06:47.873
that lingered
in the summer air.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.408
It's a thousand degrees!

06:49.410 --> 06:51.610
I'm sweating
like a razorback hog!

06:51.612 --> 06:54.379
It's really cool that you want
to do this with me, Dad.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.515
Why can't I stretch again?
-It's no good.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.850
You gotta keep those muscles
tight and ready.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.019
Don't let the tendons
get all loosey-goosey

07:01.021 --> 07:02.187
like some spaghetti man.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.723
Sons and fathers,
on your marks!

07:04.725 --> 07:07.125
All right, Steve,
as you know, first prize

07:07.127 --> 07:09.594
is a refurbished Hamilton
Beach panini press.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.297
With a little ciabatta
and a little gabagool,

07:12.299 --> 07:15.367
I'll be mangia-ing my way
straight to mama-mia-ville.

07:15.369 --> 07:16.835
(gunshot)

07:19.473 --> 07:22.073
Speed it up!

07:22.075 --> 07:25.277
Aah! I think
I sprained my ankle!

07:25.279 --> 07:26.578
It's just a twist!

07:26.580 --> 07:29.114
There was a rusty nail
in one of the tires,

07:29.116 --> 07:31.483
and now my jaw feels
like it's locking up!

07:31.485 --> 07:33.318
It's just tetanus!

07:36.223 --> 07:38.290
I'm really having
a hard time

07:38.292 --> 07:40.292
putting weight
on this foot!

07:40.294 --> 07:42.594
I don't think
I can go on!

07:42.596 --> 07:44.296
And I don't think
I can go another day

07:44.298 --> 07:45.664
eating sandwiches
that make my mouth cold!

07:45.666 --> 07:46.731
Now, pick it up!

07:46.733 --> 07:49.067
Aah!

07:49.069 --> 07:51.503
Oh, God, look at him
flat on the ground,

07:51.505 --> 07:53.472
like
a pressed hot sandwich.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.242
But why
is the tattoo a doily?

07:57.244 --> 07:58.643
His leg was broken.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.011
He spent the whole summer
laid up on the couch,

08:00.013 --> 08:01.246
learning to knit.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.614
He made doilies,

08:02.616 --> 08:04.749
each one finer
and lacier than the last.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.485
It was a nightmare.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.954
If I'd just carried him,
like I'm carrying you now...

08:08.956 --> 08:10.622
(rustling)

08:10.624 --> 08:12.257
Oh, cute, a rabbit.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.458
(bones crack)

08:13.460 --> 08:14.926
Oh, cute, a dinner.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.696
MAN: Damn. I thought
it'd be somethin' bigger.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.198
Or someone.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.768
Run for your lives!

08:23.770 --> 08:25.203
Is -- is it the --

08:25.205 --> 08:27.839
It's the Two Hundred!
They're coming!

08:27.841 --> 08:30.208
(footsteps stomping)

08:30.210 --> 08:32.010
-Go! Go!
-Get out of here!

08:32.012 --> 08:33.345
-(screaming)
-Get out of here!

08:33.347 --> 08:35.547
Stan, before
the Two Hundred kills us,

08:35.549 --> 08:37.115
I want to tell you

08:37.117 --> 08:39.384
that you were often
an inconsiderate neighbor.

08:40.387 --> 08:43.688
(singsong voice)
It's the Two Hundred!

08:43.690 --> 08:45.056
Clear out y'all!

08:45.058 --> 08:47.292
You'll run faster
without your stu-uff.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.527
Roger!

08:51.131 --> 08:52.797
We have to get moving!
The Two Hundred are coming.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.299
Oh, no,
there's no Two Hundred.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.902
Made 'em up.
I just walk around,

08:56.904 --> 09:00.305
do a creepy "Waah waah,
the Two Hundred are coming!"

09:00.307 --> 09:01.973
They scatter.
I get the stuff.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.509
It's mostly tin plates,
a lot of spoons.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.245
I have so many spoons now,
I'm like the Little Mermaid.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.047
Oh, my God, Stan!
How are you?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.815
And what's this
on the back?

09:10.817 --> 09:12.350
-It's a Greg.
-Oh, right.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.986
Greg, you remember my...
Uncle Roger?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.588
Stan, no.
That's all done now.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.056
We live
in a changed world.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.524
There's no need
for characters.

09:19.526 --> 09:20.859
I'm just a man in rags.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.861
Whose name is Clifton.
-Hi, Clifton!

09:22.863 --> 09:26.031
We're heading to the New Haven
to find Francine and the kids.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.766
Ooh!
I haven't seen them in ages!

09:27.768 --> 09:29.234
Not since the blast.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.936
I'm coming with -- wait,
is Steve gonna be there?

09:30.938 --> 09:33.371
I pray to God that he is.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.174
Guh.
I still owe him 60 bucks.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.243
But, like, he's not gonna care
about that anymore, right?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.645
And maybe he's dead!
I am coming with you.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.017
I mean, sure, I could pay
Steve back in spoons,

09:46.019 --> 09:48.720
but nowadays one spoon
is worth more than $60.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.589
How would he
even give me change?

09:50.591 --> 09:52.424
What, like
a tiny, little spoon?

09:52.426 --> 09:54.292
Oh, my God,
that sounds amazing!

09:54.294 --> 09:57.095
Let's rescue the tiny spoon
and the boy who has it!

09:59.266 --> 10:00.599
Let's hop on!

10:00.601 --> 10:03.034
These tracks go
right to the New Haven.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.202
It's on fire.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.704
I guess
we can hang around here

10:05.706 --> 10:07.472
and see if those
wild dogs are friendly.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.475
(growling, barking)

10:16.883 --> 10:18.883
(grunts)

10:20.087 --> 10:22.087
(barking, growling resumes)

10:22.089 --> 10:24.222
We did this
in the wrong order.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.958
Goodbye, Greg!
No hard feelings! (laughs)

10:26.960 --> 10:29.060
-Damn it.
-Don't beat yourself up.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.229
He was a liability
slowing us down.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.164
(panting)

10:33.166 --> 10:36.835
Ah! You did it!
Somehow.

10:36.837 --> 10:40.071
We're so...glad.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.842
Boy, that blast.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.311
I don't remember
any of it.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.147
Was it a blast?
Like the party kind?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.916
I-I just think
it's more important now

10:51.918 --> 10:53.752
than ever to try to laugh.

10:53.754 --> 10:54.786
Hey, me too.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.921
Hey!
I'm haunted by memories.

10:56.923 --> 11:01.326
So, Stan, we haven't talked
about all these tattoos.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.528
Could I ask...
that we don't?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.864
Why the garbage can tattoo
you ask?

11:05.866 --> 11:07.465
-No.
-It was a Thursday morning.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.134
Trash day.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.803
We were having a very hot
August, which was unusual.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.039
Unusual? August --
August is -- what?

11:14.041 --> 11:15.340
August is always hot.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.342
Francine was sleeping
like an angel.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.877
(garbage truck beeping)

11:18.879 --> 11:20.278
Stan, did you remember

11:20.280 --> 11:22.280
to put the garbage cans out
this time?

11:22.282 --> 11:23.615
I'm in the shower!

11:23.617 --> 11:24.883
And no-o-o!

11:30.657 --> 11:31.823
Come back!

11:31.825 --> 11:34.793
This is two weeks' worth
of trash!

11:34.795 --> 11:37.796
My husband keeps forgetting
to take it to the curb!

11:43.003 --> 11:46.304
¶¶

12:07.594 --> 12:08.760
Francine Smith.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.495
I just want
to let you know

12:10.497 --> 12:13.598
that my husband watches you
from our upstairs window.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.570
(brakes screech)

12:24.945 --> 12:28.279
Why would anyone go out
in this heat?

12:28.281 --> 12:31.616
If Francine is there
at the end of all this,

12:31.618 --> 12:33.418
I'll make it up to her.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.855
She'll never carry trash again,
unless I forget for real.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.325
Gimme food
or the cripple gets it.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.730
We just left Greg!

12:45.732 --> 12:47.732
I could tell that guy
was coming for the spoons,

12:47.734 --> 12:49.701
and I've worked too hard
and too long to --

12:49.703 --> 12:51.870
Aw, crap, I left my spoons
on the train!

12:51.872 --> 12:53.271
Greg's dead.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.206
As he should be.
He was the weakest --

12:55.208 --> 12:56.708
Hey, guys!

12:56.710 --> 12:57.876
I managed to wrestle away
his knife and kill him.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.277
This isn't my blood.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.479
Could I finish
what I was saying, please?

13:01.481 --> 13:05.049
Weakest link.
Greg is the weakest link.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.985
I got your spoons.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.360
No.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.132
(man grunts)

13:21.134 --> 13:22.634
What happened?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.302
It was a massacre.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.603
No survivors.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.105
My family was here.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.807
Is there any chance
they made it out alive?

13:28.809 --> 13:31.910
What did I just say?
Ugh.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.578
Oh, no, Stan.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.146
This looks
like Francine's locket.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.918
I'm...too late.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.586
But I'm right on time!

13:41.588 --> 13:42.787
Aaah!

13:42.789 --> 13:44.589
You big, black bitch!

13:50.664 --> 13:53.198
I bet you all think
I'm some kind of a monster,

13:53.200 --> 13:54.666
just 'cause
I'm a cannibal now.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.135
That's what these
delicious jerks are sayin'.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.370
I think you're great.
I'm nuts about ya.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.973
Stan, snap out of it!
We gotta get out of here.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.341
This guy is gonna eat us.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.945
See ya,
wouldn't wanna be ya.

14:06.947 --> 14:10.181
(sighs) What?

14:10.183 --> 14:12.717
It was just
a normal breakfast...

14:12.719 --> 14:15.186
Can't we just enjoy our ride
in the cage cart?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.688
...except
I was about to leave

14:16.690 --> 14:18.523
on a perilous mission
to South America

14:18.525 --> 14:20.458
that I knew I might not
come back from.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.394
I wanted to tell them
I loved them, but I couldn't.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.729
'Cause I never do.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.332
They would've known
something was wrong,

14:27.334 --> 14:28.900
and they
would've worried.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.836
In that moment, I wanted to say
how much they meant to me.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.005
I wanted to say
how much I regretted

14:34.007 --> 14:36.074
letting things
get to this point,

14:36.076 --> 14:39.177
where them hearing "I love you"
from me would be weird.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.981
I wanted to say all those
things, but instead I said...

14:42.983 --> 14:46.317
(voice breaking) See ya,
wouldn't wanna be ya!

14:47.988 --> 14:50.555
Those are the last words
I ever said to them.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.757
I wasn't with them
when the blast hit.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.759
I wasn't with them
when they needed me.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.027
And now they're dead.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.829
And I want to be dead,
too!

14:57.831 --> 14:59.998
Shoot me, Lewis!
I'm beggin' ya!

15:00.000 --> 15:02.166
Stan,
you're stressin' me out!

15:02.168 --> 15:06.004
Lucky for you,
I'm a stress eater.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.540
(falcon shrieks)

15:09.542 --> 15:10.541
What the hell?!

15:10.543 --> 15:11.676
(falcon shrieks)

15:11.678 --> 15:13.011
-Aah!
-(horse neighs)

15:13.013 --> 15:16.281
(heroic music plays)

15:16.283 --> 15:19.217
Never bring a gun
to a bird fight.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.586
Baby girl!
You're alive!

15:21.588 --> 15:23.755
And you continued
your interest in falcons!

15:23.757 --> 15:25.890
I wouldn't come
any closer.

15:25.892 --> 15:29.027
Oh, I appreciate the advice,
but --

15:29.029 --> 15:31.229
-Net!
-Aah!

15:31.231 --> 15:34.065
Steve! Little Steve!

15:34.067 --> 15:36.067
That took me three months
to knit!

15:36.069 --> 15:39.137
My kids are alive!
And capable!

15:39.139 --> 15:40.972
And the cart's moving!

15:40.974 --> 15:44.742
LEWIS: So strong,
I can't get a tear goin'.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.210
(dramatic music plays)

15:46.212 --> 15:49.480
(Greg, Roger screaming)

15:50.750 --> 15:52.483
(grunting)

15:57.991 --> 16:01.059
It's too heavy, Dad!

16:01.061 --> 16:02.427
We can't stop it!

16:02.429 --> 16:05.930
It's okay, kids.
You can let go.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.265
He doesn't speak
for the cart!

16:07.267 --> 16:09.067
Take care of each other.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.070
(heroic music plays)
Francine!

16:12.072 --> 16:15.406
Thanks to you always hiding
in the bathroom on trash day,

16:15.408 --> 16:19.143
I have a powerful set of
the muscles I'm using now.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.611
(grunting)

16:20.613 --> 16:22.647
(smooching)

16:22.649 --> 16:25.083
(strained)
In a minute, Stan.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.755
I thought you were dead
when I found the locket.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.991
You never take it off.
It's too precious to you.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.425
I traded it
for flip-flops.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.661
There were communal showers
at New Haven.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.996
Which is why
we left New Haven.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.430
Couldn't do it.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.866
Now that we're reunited,
I want to say something

16:41.868 --> 16:44.002
I couldn't bring myself
to say before.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.603
(inhales)

16:45.605 --> 16:47.672
I would like to see ya.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.507
And I would want
to be ya.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.776
Is that
what you wanted to say?
Don't rush me.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.611
There'll be plenty of time
for that later.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.880
(laughs)
You all think you're safe?

16:55.882 --> 16:59.517
You think I'm alone?
(whistles)

16:59.519 --> 17:02.987
(ominous music plays)

17:02.989 --> 17:06.124
(crowd chants)

17:06.126 --> 17:07.625
I love you guys so much.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.929
It's time we feast.
Take them.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.200
It's the
T-T-T-Two Hundred!

17:16.202 --> 17:18.369
Nonsense!
I made the Two Hundred up.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.071
They don't exist.
Whaaa?

17:22.575 --> 17:24.842
HAYLEY:
Two hundred Rogers?

17:24.844 --> 17:26.477
ROGER: Two hundred mes?

17:26.479 --> 17:28.980
I don't underst--
oh, right. I remember.

17:28.982 --> 17:32.884
MAN: Welcome, Mrs. Houlihan's
sixth grade class,

17:32.886 --> 17:35.987
to our brand-new
Hadron Collider.

17:35.989 --> 17:38.423
This is where we shoot
sub-atomic particles

17:38.425 --> 17:39.690
at fantastic speeds.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.192
And you kids are in luck,

17:41.194 --> 17:43.728
because today we're shooting
our first beam.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.430
First beam!

17:45.432 --> 17:47.532
Now, kids,
if you look through here,

17:47.534 --> 17:50.234
you can actually see
inside the collider tunnel.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.537
-Can we go in there?
-Good Lord, no!

17:52.539 --> 17:54.572
That would be wildly dangerous.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.407
But he's in there.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.943
Sorry!
I dropped my Ray-Bans.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.445
(metallic humming)
What's that sound?

18:00.447 --> 18:03.014
The beam!
It's starting!

18:03.016 --> 18:04.348
Ouch!

18:04.350 --> 18:06.350
Something really, really small
just hit me.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.952
Ouch! And again!

18:07.954 --> 18:09.454
Ow.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.721
Ow.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.124
Ow.
-Dear God.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.459
-Ow!
-(cries)

18:14.461 --> 18:16.260
Ow! Ow!

18:16.262 --> 18:19.530
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow,
ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

18:19.532 --> 18:20.865
I feel like
I'm gonna fart.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.100
(farts)

18:23.736 --> 18:26.437
Come on, man.
Just a little wind.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.606
Yeah!

18:33.646 --> 18:36.581
Oh! They were hitting me
with bosons.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.117
Yeah, yeah,
you can't do that.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.586
The particle impact
caused my personas to split

18:41.588 --> 18:43.654
and form separate
physical entities,

18:43.656 --> 18:45.923
which released
a cataclysmic energy burst.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.091
I apologize, everyone.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.459
I'm the one
who ended the world.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.061
Saved these babies,
though.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.296
Aw, damn it,
there's a crack in them.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.833
(mob screams)

18:55.835 --> 18:57.768
-Jeannie Gold!
-Tom Yabo!

18:57.770 --> 18:59.937
-Genevieve Vavance!
-Braff Zacklin!

18:59.939 --> 19:01.973
-Roy Rogers McFreely!
-Kevin Bacon!

19:01.975 --> 19:04.008
-Horse Renoir!
-Chex LeMeneux!

19:04.010 --> 19:05.776
-Clive Trotter!
-Miles Raymond!

19:05.778 --> 19:08.412
-The Phantom of the Telethon!
-Cleshawn Montegue!

19:08.414 --> 19:11.015
-Captain Francois Dubonet!
-Roland Chang!

19:11.017 --> 19:12.817
General Juanito Pequeño!

19:12.819 --> 19:15.520
Ricky Spanish!

19:15.522 --> 19:17.688
-Max Jets!
-Jenny Fromdabloc!

19:17.690 --> 19:20.191
-Frankie Carconni!
-Ruby Zeldastein!

19:20.193 --> 19:21.826
-Uncle Roger!
-Dr. Penguin!

19:21.828 --> 19:23.928
-Jojo Quinoa!
-Michael Corbin!

19:23.930 --> 19:26.197
-The Legman!
-Dan Ansome Handsome!

19:26.199 --> 19:28.599
-Arbuckle T. Boone!
-Lazlo Morphine!

19:28.601 --> 19:30.635
-Shalonda Dykes!
-Dom Fikowski!

19:30.637 --> 19:33.471
-Dimitri Garabedian!
-Morris Buttermaker!

19:33.473 --> 19:35.973
-Sidney Huffman!
-Reaganomics Lamborghini!

19:35.975 --> 19:37.942
-Martin Sugar!
-Burt Jarvis!

19:37.944 --> 19:39.944
-Cuss Mustard!
-Frank Slade!

19:39.946 --> 19:42.713
-Abigail Lemonparty!
-Twill Ongenbone!

19:42.715 --> 19:45.783
And who could forget Clip Clop!

19:45.785 --> 19:48.319
Are they...
on our side?

19:48.321 --> 19:51.989
Kevi-i-i-i-i-n Ramage!

19:51.991 --> 19:53.291
Aah!

19:53.293 --> 19:54.825
They are not
on our side.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.795
(screaming continues)

19:57.797 --> 20:02.066
I think we all knew
it would end this way.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.702
(growling)

20:04.704 --> 20:08.406
Did somebody order the fish?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.241
Whooooo!

20:15.715 --> 20:18.482
(birds chirping)

20:18.484 --> 20:21.085
And that's the end
of the story.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.186
(children laughing)

20:22.188 --> 20:25.489
¶¶

20:40.607 --> 20:42.440
Grandpa, how come
you never talk about

20:42.442 --> 20:43.941
what happened
in the battle?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.010
'Cause grandpa didn't
have a great view

20:46.012 --> 20:47.245
from his hiding spot.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.013
But that's not
what's important.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.015
What's important
is that every day,

20:51.017 --> 20:54.719
we take a moment and tell
the people we care about...

20:54.721 --> 20:58.055
"Don't let Roger
in a Hadron Collider!"

20:58.057 --> 21:02.093
I need to be watched
very closely.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.995
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
