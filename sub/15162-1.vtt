01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.335
He was a real winner.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:34.588
He loved to fish,
and he taught me that

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:38.842
some fish go
for flashy lure

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:41.887
while others,
they like the simple bait.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:44.306
It seems our Gavin is
quite the fisherman.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.728
-No.
-No.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.189
[Caroline]
Wow.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:53.565
[Margot]
On a first date?

01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:34.564
I'm sorry that
I let you down.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.817
I am so sorry about that.

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:42.989
I just hadn't felt that way
since your dad died...

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:47.577
and I just...

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:52.499
I just let it get--
I just let it get too far.

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:54.584
It's okay.
It's okay, Mom.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.420
I forgive you.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.672
I just miss you
but you deserve to be happy.

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:00.006
I am happy.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:07.013
I am happy with just you
and me, and I...

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:11.143
I don't need anything else.

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:12.519
We can always get cats.

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:13.687
[laughs]

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.441
I don't want cats.

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.240
-Can I go to college with you?
-Mm-hmm.

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:26.825
You can live in my dorm.

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:28.285
[both laugh]

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.289
-Let's go back to bed.
-Yeah.

01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:44.926
[splash]

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.687
I mean, the only thing
we can prove to the police

01:02:55.731 --> 01:02:58.648
is that he's a cheater,
and that's not exactly a crime.

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:00.275
[Reporter]
The body of another young woman

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:02.360
has washed ashore
here in Venice Beach

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.738
Police now suspect
that a serial killer may be...

01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:05.947
Turn that up, please.

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:07.324
-Could you turn that up?
-Yeah.

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:09.618
21-year-old Halle Philton,
a college student,

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:12.412
disappeared after telling
a roommate she was going to

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.664
go connect with a man she had
been talking with online.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:17.876
Philton's body was found here
in shallow water

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.629
actually about 100 yards
from where coffee heiress

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:23.256
Alexia Montrose
was found recently,

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.467
and it turns out that
there are other similarities

01:03:25.511 --> 01:03:26.760
between these two young women.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:27.844
Both have red hair,

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:29.971
both of them died
under similar circumstances

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:31.848
-although the detectives
won't tell us
-Oh, my God.

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:33.517
what those circumstances are.

01:03:35.354 --> 01:03:36.770
Doesn't look like our fisherman
is the catch and release type.

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:38.230
More the catch and gut type.

01:03:40.234 --> 01:03:42.526
I have to see him
this afternoon.

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:43.819
Well, if you don't show up,

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.153
he'll know something's up.

01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:48.281
So, go to lunch
and get the evidence

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.325
and then we will go
straight to the police.

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:53.078
[sighs]

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:04.339
♪ I couldn't see the lies
right through their eyes ♪

01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:05.757
♪ But now the truth be
plain as daylight ♪

01:04:05.801 --> 01:04:08.301
Everything okay?

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.428
Uh, not really. No.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:14.516
Client backed out on me
unexpectedly today.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.934
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:04:15.978 --> 01:04:17.394
Oh, be sorry for them.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.354
People pay the price
when they toy with me.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.441
Do you trust me?

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:25.318
Yeah, of course.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.530
Because I-- I'm starting
to get the feeling you don't.

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:30.031
Why would you say that?

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:32.492
You've been acting
differently lately.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:34.494
Are you sure you're not
getting cold feet?

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.997
No, I'm planning to make
the transfer on Friday

01:04:37.082 --> 01:04:39.332
from Jason's account to yours
just like we were talking about.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:40.709
Good.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:45.171
Honey, everything is
gonna be okay.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.507
After Friday, we won't have
a care in the world.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:53.054
What is the catch
of the day?

01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:01.605
[Caroline recording]
Everything okay?

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:04.107
[Gavin]
Uh, not really. No,

01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:07.986
A client backed out
on me unexpectedly today.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.697
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Oh, be sorry for them.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:13.366
People pay the price
when they toy with me.

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:17.412
Well, now that's something.

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.961
[Detective Mickle]
So what kind of business
do you do, Mr. Donato?

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:27.255
I am an independent
financial consultant.

01:05:27.299 --> 01:05:28.798
Right.

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:31.092
That's nice
and vague, isn't it?

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:33.970
For someone who has

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:36.056
little idea how
the financial world works,

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.682
I suppose
it would be, Detective.

01:05:37.726 --> 01:05:38.892
[chuckles]

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:41.561
So, if I wanted to see records

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:43.688
of all your most recent
business transactions...

01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:46.066
You'd need a warrant.

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:47.651
And while we're on the subject

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.653
of me telling you
how to do your job,

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:52.572
I am not saying another word
until my lawyer gets here.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.824
All right, Mr. Donato.

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:57.953
We don't have to talk
about your business.

01:05:57.996 --> 01:06:00.246
But until your lawyer gets here,

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:02.916
why don't you just humor me
with some small talk?

01:06:05.337 --> 01:06:07.587
You're from Italy, Mr. Donato.

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:08.755
Yes.

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:10.840
-Where in Italy?
-Nerano.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:12.384
It is a small village.

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:15.345
Si.

01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:16.930

[speaking Italian]

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.652
Oh, maybe you just
prefer to speak English.

01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:43.498
Got a girlfriend, Gavin?

01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:46.543
I mean, a good looking
boy like you...

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:48.545
bet you meet a lot
of nice girls online.

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:51.381
[gasps]
Luckily, we have a warrant

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:53.008
for the bank records
of Halle Philton.

01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:56.469
Care to explain this?

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:03.018
I know you're not trying
to talk to my client

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:04.310
without me being
present, Detective.

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:09.983
Oh, your client?

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:12.902
Oh, we were just having
a little chat
about his love life.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:15.697
Hear he makes
quite the killing.

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:17.866
I don't know what
you're insinuating, Detective,

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:20.201
but unless you're charging
Mr. Donato with something,

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:21.327
we're leaving.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:26.082
Gratzi.

01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:27.125
[Detective Mickle chuckles]

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.259
Wow, your boyfriend's
a real charmer.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.178
That was it?

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.305
He's still expecting a transfer
from you tomorrow, right?

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:42.015
Yeah.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.558
Good.

01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:45.268
I'll put together
a sting operation.

01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:48.605
But that's all for financial
fraud charges, right?

01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:50.607
I mean, this guy
is a killer, Detective.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.942
Listen, caught is caught.

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:55.236
Once we've got him
under our thumb,

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.781
if there's more evidence
to be found, we'll find it.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:07:59.032
For now we have to work
with what we've got.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.724
-And this stuff, yeah,
it's easier than I--
-Totally.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:25.642
-than it looks, right?
-Yeah.

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:28.353
Hello, my love.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:29.938
Hey.

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:35.443
I thought it was
about time I met Issie

01:08:35.487 --> 01:08:37.569
and I-- I wanted
to surprise you.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:41.282
Gavin was just giving me
advice on how to handle Noah.

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:43.993
Ah, yes. But remember,
if he doesn't step up

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:47.412
and treat you like
you are the only one for him,

01:08:47.499 --> 01:08:49.457
he is dead to you.

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:51.251
Issie, I need to speak to Gavin.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.794
If you could go
to your room, please.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:54.129
-But he was gonna take us--
-Now, Issie.

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:05.890
You know, I gotta hand it
to you, Caroline.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:10.478
I didn't think
you'd be this much trouble.

01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:11.604
You're not even Italian.

01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:14.858
Yeah, that-- that first date...

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:15.942
[sighs]

01:09:15.986 --> 01:09:18.736
it was, um, the test

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.990
to see how much effort
I'm gonna need to put in.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:26.452
And you...

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:32.000
with those starry eyes and...

your broken heart, you...

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:41.759
you were like Silly Putty
from the moment we met.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:47.015
Screw you, Gavin.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.767
Okay.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:57.609
You see, I...

01:09:57.652 --> 01:10:01.821
I find that if you push
a woman's boundaries sexually,

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:04.407
she's more inclined to take

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:07.577
chances outside
of the bedroom...

01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:11.748
like steal from work for a guy
she knows nothin' about.

01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:16.377
You didn't break me, Gavin.

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:17.795
Get out of my house.

against happiness."

It is time to give up

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:54.457
your money because
if you go to the police,

01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:55.833
if you go up
against me...

-I'm gonna go
over to Noah's.
-Yeah, okay.

01:11:16.648 --> 01:11:18.064
Are you okay?

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.487
Yeah, no, I can--
I can drive you to Noah's.

Did you-- you guys
got back together?

01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:28.992
Yeah. Gavin's advice
actually worked.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:30.493
I see why you like him so much.

01:11:30.537 --> 01:11:32.704
