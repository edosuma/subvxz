Episode Title :
<font color=#FFFF00>"Rapunzeltopia"</font>

00:46.343 --> 00:47.604
Morning, Raps.

00:49.665 --> 00:50.871
Mmm...

00:50.959 --> 00:52.393
Good morning.

00:52.628 --> 00:53.831
What's with your outfit?

00:53.919 --> 00:56.268
I know!
It's cute, right?

00:56.393 --> 00:59.006
Cass? Uh...

00:59.093 --> 01:00.417
we're in Corona?

01:00.537 --> 01:03.823
Well, where else
would we be, silly?

01:06.245 --> 01:07.247
My hair!

01:07.334 --> 01:09.516
What... what happened
to my hair?!

01:09.603 --> 01:11.974
Eh, looks like just
a mild case of bed-head.

01:12.662 --> 01:13.956
You've
had worse, I'm sure.

01:14.044 --> 01:18.292
- And good morning, Cassandra!
- Good morning, Eugene.

01:19.263 --> 01:22.290
Looks like someone's got
some pre-coronation jitters.

01:22.378 --> 01:23.497
Coronation?!

01:23.584 --> 01:25.666
What are you
talking about?

01:25.753 --> 01:27.134
Very fun...

01:27.221 --> 01:28.435
Oh, you're serious.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.088
Gotcha. Yeah,
no, Sunshine.

01:30.176 --> 01:32.311
It's your coronation
weekend.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.619
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, it's just that...

01:35.970 --> 01:38.645
This isn't how things are.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.815
The coronation
already happened.

01:40.903 --> 01:42.541
My blonde
hair is back.

01:42.632 --> 01:46.526
We left Corona almost a year ago
to travel to the Dark Kingdom.

01:46.682 --> 01:48.791
Sounds like you had
some dream last night.

01:48.879 --> 01:50.549
The coronation that
hasn't happened yet...

01:50.637 --> 01:52.625
happened and also...

01:52.713 --> 01:54.299
Dark Kingdom stuff?

01:54.548 --> 01:57.492
Sounds like someone was stuck
in a tower a little too long.

01:57.580 --> 02:00.002
This one has such
a vivid imagination.

02:01.330 --> 02:04.405
It felt so real.

02:04.492 --> 02:05.854
But...

02:05.972 --> 02:09.643
then again, everything
seems so perfect here, I...

02:09.912 --> 02:12.416
must be coming off
of a crazy dream.

02:12.504 --> 02:13.534
Well, Raps,

02:13.622 --> 02:15.261
You know I love goofing
around with you two,

02:15.348 --> 02:17.961
but it's a big day and we
do have a schedule to keep.

02:18.049 --> 02:20.353
So, whattaya say we get
this day started, huh?

02:26.093 --> 02:27.443
Okay.

02:27.531 --> 02:28.966
That sounds perfect.

02:29.256 --> 02:31.524
Rapunzel!
There you are!

02:31.641 --> 02:32.733
Hi, Dad!

02:32.821 --> 02:34.780
Pops! Up high!

02:36.026 --> 02:39.389
Cassandra, I need to borrow
our princess for a moment.

02:43.437 --> 02:46.695
Look
how happy everyone is today.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.695
Good morning,
Rapunzel!

02:50.844 --> 02:53.164
I am ready
to party!

02:53.252 --> 02:55.286
And it's all
because of you!

02:57.516 --> 02:59.284
I just wanted
to take a moment

02:59.380 --> 03:01.395
to tell you how proud
I am of you.

03:01.482 --> 03:05.265
Oh! And show you the many
festivities we've planned! See?

03:16.968 --> 03:20.079
Can you believe these jokers were
gonna disrupt the coronation?

03:20.174 --> 03:21.977
Ha! Not on
our watch!

03:22.390 --> 03:24.383
Today is going to be
the happiest,

03:24.471 --> 03:27.063
most perfect day
Corona has ever seen.

03:27.944 --> 03:30.179
It already is, Dad.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.281
Good then.
I must be off!

03:32.408 --> 03:34.723
I get to judge
the pudding contest!

03:34.865 --> 03:36.727
Best day ever!

03:51.734 --> 03:53.349
Who are you?

03:53.601 --> 03:55.067
And what do you want?

03:56.237 --> 03:57.451
Ugh!

04:00.941 --> 04:02.474
Whoa!

04:03.768 --> 04:05.517
A frying pan?!

04:05.713 --> 04:07.221
Who are you?

04:07.514 --> 04:10.400
Because that's
kind of my... thing.

04:15.976 --> 04:17.091
Okay...

04:17.213 --> 04:19.963
- Try not to freak out...
- Try not to freak out?!

04:21.464 --> 04:22.783
Oh, why would
I freak out?!

04:22.871 --> 04:25.044
Meeting myself is
perfectly normal, right?!

04:25.132 --> 04:27.114
Trust me, I am
not freaking out.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.994
Okay. I'm meeting myself.
I'm meeting myself.

04:31.362 --> 04:33.377
- I'm meeting myself!
- Right?!

04:33.540 --> 04:34.658
- So neat!
- So neat!

04:36.027 --> 04:37.734
- You said the same thing I said!
- You said the same thing I said!

04:39.494 --> 04:41.662
- Best day!
- Best day!

04:41.814 --> 04:43.952
- Ha! You thought
- Ha! You thought

04:44.040 --> 04:46.485
- I was gonna say "ever" but I stopped!
- I was gonna say "ever" but I stopped!

04:46.704 --> 04:48.898
Not to sound
conceited or anything,

04:49.049 --> 04:50.640
but you are the best.

04:50.728 --> 04:53.173
- I was gonna say the same thing!
- I know!

04:53.260 --> 04:54.408
Okay.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.140
You know
as amazing as this is,

04:57.228 --> 05:00.981
I... sort of feel like
I'm officially losing it.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.885
You're not going crazy.

05:02.988 --> 05:05.494
I know you remember
the black rocks,

05:05.673 --> 05:08.021
the world outside Corona,

05:08.108 --> 05:11.189
your...
Our destiny.

05:11.277 --> 05:16.080
No, my destiny is here...
in Corona.

05:16.322 --> 05:18.049
This isn't Corona.

05:18.137 --> 05:20.549
This place isn't real.

05:20.637 --> 05:22.711
The real world
isn't as easy.

05:22.799 --> 05:24.004
It's in your head.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.440
You're still in the House
of Yesterday's Tomorrows.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.619
You're under
a spell.

05:29.174 --> 05:31.961
No. No. No, that's...

05:32.049 --> 05:33.547
that's not true.

05:33.674 --> 05:35.382
I like it here.

05:35.549 --> 05:39.096
I know you do,
but it's all a dream.

05:39.369 --> 05:41.521
And if you don't
do something soon...

05:41.608 --> 05:44.773
<i>you'll be trapped
here forever!</i>

05:50.367 --> 05:51.557
Rapunzel!

05:51.748 --> 05:54.463
- Rapunzel!
- Where could she be?

05:54.551 --> 05:56.713
Rapunzel!

05:56.850 --> 05:57.965
You know, this
is a hoot,

05:58.053 --> 05:59.945
but we'd cover more
ground if we split up.

06:00.033 --> 06:02.376
Cheekbones, Sandwiches,
you take that hallway.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.479
Oh, now she's doing
clever nicknames? Wonderful.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.220
<i>Cassandra.</i>

06:13.307 --> 06:14.814
Hello?

06:14.908 --> 06:17.025
Rapunzel, is that you?

06:17.258 --> 06:18.858
<i>Cassandra...</i>

06:22.983 --> 06:23.730
Huh!

06:23.817 --> 06:26.466
This door gives me
the creeps.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.436
Did you see that?
Someone's in there.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.637
Rapunzel,
are you in there?!

06:30.724 --> 06:32.164
How do you wanna go
about picking this lock?

06:32.252 --> 06:33.273
The click-clack?

06:33.360 --> 06:34.420
The tweezer twist?

06:34.508 --> 06:35.642
The flippity flappet?

06:36.672 --> 06:38.245
Ah!
The boot pick.

06:38.332 --> 06:39.579
Less subtle,
but efficient.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.981
What is this place?

06:44.801 --> 06:45.877
Rapunzel!

06:45.965 --> 06:47.788
Less noise, please.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.823
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh,
less noise.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.111
Matthews!

06:51.199 --> 06:52.941
I knew you
were up to no good!

06:53.121 --> 06:55.429
You have no idea
how no good

06:55.516 --> 06:57.059
I really am.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.268
Matthews!

07:01.355 --> 07:02.441
Not quite...

07:02.529 --> 07:06.480
I am Tromus.

07:06.651 --> 07:09.058
And my master, Zhan Tiri,

07:09.146 --> 07:12.340
has a great need
for this little sun drop.

07:12.518 --> 07:16.012
Once these vines wrap
round her completely,

07:16.215 --> 07:19.119
she'll have surrendered
to the dream world,

07:19.206 --> 07:22.806
and the sun drop's
limitless power will belong

07:22.894 --> 07:24.118
to Zhan Tiri!

07:24.206 --> 07:25.665
Blondie! Wake up!

07:25.753 --> 07:28.503
Mm-mm-mm-mm,
nope. Sorry.

07:28.591 --> 07:30.439
The only way that's
going to happen

07:30.527 --> 07:32.909
is if Lemon Head
wakes herself up.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.157
But will she want
to leave paradise?

07:36.400 --> 07:38.782
Probably not.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.874
The only way to escape
Dream Corona

07:42.962 --> 07:46.146
is to go where the sunflower
once grew and grab...

07:46.233 --> 07:47.954
Grab the black rocks?

07:48.189 --> 07:50.814
Wait, no.
This is nuts.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.314
You're not
even real.

07:52.402 --> 07:53.429
You're right!

07:53.517 --> 07:56.360
I'm not!
We're so smart.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.225
C'mon, we don't
have much time.

07:58.406 --> 08:00.521
I don't know if I can.

08:00.687 --> 08:01.901
What about
the coronation?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.189
If you decide
to put that crown on,

08:04.277 --> 08:06.642
it will mean that you
accept this world...

08:06.730 --> 08:09.446
and you will be
stuck here forever!

08:14.328 --> 08:17.511
Ugh, it seems as though her
subconscious self is acting up.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.880
It's time to reenter
her dream,

08:19.967 --> 08:21.948
and tip the scales.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.252
Rapunzel!

08:25.339 --> 08:26.420
Work work work!

08:26.507 --> 08:28.889
A disciple's work...
is never done.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.277
Rapunzel!

08:33.514 --> 08:34.861
- Listen...
- Rapunzel!

08:34.948 --> 08:36.363
There you are.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.582
Eugene! Oh...

08:37.669 --> 08:39.551
You are not
gonna believe this.

08:39.639 --> 08:40.856
Look!

08:40.950 --> 08:42.068
What?!

08:42.155 --> 08:43.804
She was just there!

08:43.890 --> 08:44.771
It was me!

08:44.858 --> 08:47.785
Well, not me,
but... me, you know?

08:47.895 --> 08:49.479
With my hair back, and...

08:49.567 --> 08:51.912
she wanted me to lead
her to the black rocks.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.040
Wants you to
lead her to what?

08:54.680 --> 08:56.719
I'm sorry, ya lost me.

08:57.243 --> 08:59.057
Hey, it's such a perfect day,

08:59.145 --> 09:00.787
what do you say
we get some fresh air?

09:00.973 --> 09:02.590
You're right.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.182
I need to clear
my head.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.848
Follow me.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.796
Woo-hoo!

09:09.883 --> 09:11.781
Eat my dust!

09:11.869 --> 09:12.898
Oh, come on!

09:12.986 --> 09:14.801
You know I'm on
a low-dust diet!

09:48.566 --> 09:51.805
Wow, Pascal...

09:51.892 --> 09:54.708
that is...

09:54.795 --> 09:56.977
some view.

10:02.255 --> 10:03.401
Hi!

10:03.489 --> 10:06.582
Would you stop
materializing everywhere?!

10:06.670 --> 10:08.387
You can't keep
avoiding me!

10:08.475 --> 10:11.558
You know us!
We are way too persistent!

10:11.682 --> 10:14.765
I know.
I love that about us.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.433
Rapunzel, you need
to snap out of this.

10:18.521 --> 10:21.571
Look, it's a tough choice,
but you have to make it!

10:21.659 --> 10:22.673
Why?!

10:22.761 --> 10:24.480
Look at it out there!

10:24.568 --> 10:26.539
This is where I belong.

10:26.627 --> 10:27.650
Ha-ha!

10:29.416 --> 10:31.064
Okay, I know
what you're thinking.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.540
Now, it may have
seemed like you won.

10:33.931 --> 10:35.715
But... hey, you okay?

10:35.803 --> 10:36.884
Yeah...

10:36.972 --> 10:38.181
I'm okay.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.056
I just, uh,
I-I thought I saw someone.

10:41.144 --> 10:42.416
Saw someone?

10:42.504 --> 10:43.757
The pressure of
the coronation

10:43.844 --> 10:45.801
has really gotten
to you, hasn't it?

10:45.912 --> 10:48.988
You must feel like the weight of
the world is on your shoulders,

10:49.324 --> 10:50.543
but, it's not.

10:50.688 --> 10:52.275
All of us are here
to carry that weight,

10:52.363 --> 10:54.100
to make those
choices for you.

10:54.285 --> 10:56.183
Which, speaking of
"all of us,"

10:56.292 --> 10:58.361
it's about time we head
back to the castle

10:58.449 --> 11:00.244
for the
welcoming ceremony.

11:00.332 --> 11:01.377
Besides,

11:01.465 --> 11:04.512
nothin' to see out there,
but a whole lotta nothin'!

11:05.997 --> 11:08.627
I can think of no
better way to celebrate

11:08.715 --> 11:10.847
the love I have for
this woman than this.

11:11.827 --> 11:13.793
Oh, Eugene!

11:17.461 --> 11:19.076
Just listen...

11:19.164 --> 11:21.144
Why are you
doing this?!

11:24.074 --> 11:25.764
I gotta admit,

11:25.852 --> 11:28.768
I was not expecting
that response,

11:28.855 --> 11:30.303
but hear me out.

11:30.519 --> 11:33.228
Rapunzel, from the moment
I entered your tower...

11:33.316 --> 11:36.637
I know leading the team out
on the road hasn't been easy.

11:36.725 --> 11:38.577
It would be easier
to step back

11:38.665 --> 11:40.814
and let someone else
make the tough calls,

11:40.901 --> 11:43.504
but you know we
can't do that.

11:43.644 --> 11:44.884
We have to go back.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.419
Even if what you
say is true,

11:46.506 --> 11:48.431
why would I leave
all of this?

11:48.519 --> 11:50.486
Cass is fine.

11:50.574 --> 11:52.058
My friends are safe.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.595
Nobody is asking me to make
some kind of huge life decision.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.132
Ugh, you know
what I mean.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.730
Everything is
perfect here,

12:00.818 --> 12:02.900
so why would I
come with you?!

12:02.988 --> 12:04.569
If you don't,

12:04.657 --> 12:07.728
it could literally be the end
of the world as we know it.

12:07.816 --> 12:09.976
Well, maybe, I don't want
that responsibility.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.699
Maybe I just want
to be happy.

12:12.787 --> 12:14.574
Is that too much
to ask?!

12:15.019 --> 12:18.160
So is that a... maybe?

12:18.711 --> 12:20.996
Don't do it,
Rapunzel.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.922
No...

12:23.009 --> 12:24.629
it's a yes.

12:24.801 --> 12:26.902
My answer is yes.

12:27.082 --> 12:30.329
I would love to
marry you, Eugene.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.867
And to stay in this castle
forever and ever...

12:33.954 --> 12:35.368
and ever.

12:43.365 --> 12:46.574
<i>Magnifique!</i> The power
of the sun drop

12:46.767 --> 12:49.192
is nearly in
Zhan Tiri's grasp!

12:49.692 --> 12:51.439
How did we not
see this bad guy coming?

12:51.527 --> 12:53.087
We're usually pretty good
at that sort of thing.

12:53.175 --> 12:54.988
Wait until I'm free!

12:55.075 --> 12:56.691
That's just it,<i> mon ami.</i>

12:56.785 --> 12:58.871
You never shall be free...

12:58.997 --> 13:02.714
And in a few moments, 
nor shall she!

13:07.908 --> 13:10.790
I used to be
so much like you.

13:10.878 --> 13:14.529
I had silly dreams of finding
adventure and saving the world.

13:14.795 --> 13:18.082
Luckily, I had a place
to put those dreams.

13:20.509 --> 13:21.688
My...

13:22.391 --> 13:24.621
I mean,
a journal!

13:28.255 --> 13:31.066
- It's blank?
- Of course it is.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.992
There's no point
in having a journal

13:33.079 --> 13:35.061
if somebody's going
to fill it for you.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.308
<i>"Sois satisfaite!</i>"

13:40.441 --> 13:42.769
It means,
"Be satisfied."

13:42.926 --> 13:45.738
As princess, you need
to show your subjects

13:45.826 --> 13:47.433
that you are content.

13:47.526 --> 13:48.816
What if I decide t...

13:48.904 --> 13:52.988
Rapunzel, you don't
have to decide anything.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.519
Be content with
where you are?

14:00.785 --> 14:02.558
Something's not
right, Pascal.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.270
Raps...

14:17.357 --> 14:19.017
It's coronation time.

14:19.578 --> 14:21.478
Why are you looking
at me like that?

14:22.832 --> 14:23.946
Cass...

14:24.364 --> 14:26.246
are you happy here?

14:26.333 --> 14:27.614
Of course,
why wouldn't I be?

14:27.701 --> 14:30.150
My best friend is
getting crowned princess.

14:30.299 --> 14:31.806
What's better than that?

14:33.626 --> 14:35.095
Hm...

14:36.730 --> 14:38.712
Absolutely nothing.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.880
Good.

14:39.968 --> 14:41.275
Now, what are
we waiting for?

14:41.447 --> 14:43.166
Let's get you
coronated.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.306
Time's almost up.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.783
I would start getting
nervous if I were you!

14:58.002 --> 14:59.746
Rapunzel,
please wake up!

15:01.701 --> 15:02.984
Rapunzel!

15:03.072 --> 15:04.751
The wearer of this crown

15:04.838 --> 15:07.367
is a shining example
of the promise

15:07.455 --> 15:09.312
that is Corona.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.853
Once you put
that crown on,

15:13.941 --> 15:15.122
you'll accept this world,

15:15.210 --> 15:17.703
and you will be
stuck here forever.

15:23.970 --> 15:25.438
This isn't real...

15:27.951 --> 15:30.361
<i>The black
rocks are the only way out.</i>

15:30.509 --> 15:33.189
<i>You have to touch
the black rocks!</i>

15:35.668 --> 15:38.084
This isn't real!

15:39.786 --> 15:42.111
Oh, I know!
Being crowned princess,

15:42.208 --> 15:44.439
it just doesn't seem
real, right? Ha-ha...

15:44.533 --> 15:45.658
Blondie,
what're you doing?

15:45.745 --> 15:47.060
Just put your crown on.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.394
Everything's fine!

15:48.481 --> 15:52.198
It is tempting to follow the
path of least resistance,

15:52.548 --> 15:55.236
but that is not me!

15:56.526 --> 15:58.509
This one's got some kick!

16:00.345 --> 16:02.744
I tried to do this
the easy way.

16:06.232 --> 16:09.291
You said no to the dream.

16:09.602 --> 16:13.586
Let's see how you enjoy being
trapped in your worst nightmare!

16:15.941 --> 16:18.189
Max!
To the black rocks!

16:25.285 --> 16:27.416
You did this to me,
Rapunzel!

16:28.521 --> 16:31.931
It's all because
I followed you!

16:44.270 --> 16:47.220
This would be a bad time to be
wrong about this being a dream!

16:47.307 --> 16:50.223
You don't get it,
do you, Princess?

16:50.310 --> 16:52.592
I control this world!

17:07.327 --> 17:09.776
Uh, hey!
Other me!

17:10.141 --> 17:12.744
I could really use
your help right about now!

17:13.008 --> 17:15.248
Where am I when I need me?!

17:18.505 --> 17:19.709
Hi, again!

17:19.797 --> 17:21.705
Need a little help
wrapping these guys up?

17:21.794 --> 17:23.294
If you wouldn't mind!

17:23.392 --> 17:25.006
I love how polite
you are!

17:35.714 --> 17:37.050
Ha!

17:37.184 --> 17:38.778
Dream fighting is easy...

17:53.740 --> 17:55.955
No! Pascal!

17:57.776 --> 18:01.054
Don't worry,
I'm not real, remember?!

18:01.194 --> 18:02.491
Now, run!

18:15.295 --> 18:19.097
Pascal, please stop!

18:27.140 --> 18:30.390
I hate to do this, but
you're giving me no choice!

18:44.244 --> 18:46.463
Hello, Rapunzel.

18:46.635 --> 18:50.463
Oh, I've missed you,
my precious flower.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.939
When will you realize I will
always get the better of you,

18:54.099 --> 18:56.981
whether you're
trapped in a tower,

18:57.208 --> 19:01.309
or trapped in
your own mind.

19:03.916 --> 19:05.631
My own mind...

19:06.247 --> 19:07.360
You're right.

19:07.505 --> 19:10.005
This is my mind.

19:10.185 --> 19:11.958
I'm in control.

19:18.427 --> 19:20.192
How many
times must you hear

19:20.280 --> 19:22.195
before you understand
that Mother knows be...

19:24.330 --> 19:27.346
I have always
wanted to do that.

19:27.433 --> 19:31.192
I have had enough!

19:33.363 --> 19:36.579
You will not escape
my control!

19:36.872 --> 19:40.013
You have no power
over me here!

19:42.189 --> 19:43.303
You thought

19:43.391 --> 19:45.974
by dangling an easy
life in front of me,

19:46.062 --> 19:48.583
that I would follow
you into oblivion.

19:48.677 --> 19:51.692
Well, you were wrong.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.481
I am a lot tougher
than you think.

20:00.091 --> 20:03.216
From now on,
the only thing that I follow...

20:03.318 --> 20:05.323
is my destiny.

20:06.575 --> 20:10.074
Nooo!

20:15.315 --> 20:17.638
Blondie!

20:19.800 --> 20:21.378
Eugene!

20:22.731 --> 20:24.337
Hate to be a squeaky
third wheel,

20:24.424 --> 20:25.605
but can we get out of
here, please?!

20:25.692 --> 20:26.909
This place is
coming down!

20:26.997 --> 20:28.231
Follow me!

20:47.747 --> 20:51.083
This isn't over!

20:58.358 --> 20:59.605
Everybody okay?

21:03.340 --> 21:04.762
Well, well, well.

21:04.850 --> 21:05.880
Shorty?

21:05.968 --> 21:08.784
Look who finally
decided to show up.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.017
Max! Fidella!

21:11.104 --> 21:13.619
Oh, it's good
to see you, too.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.263
Have you
seen Cass?

21:17.470 --> 21:18.713
Hold on a second.

21:28.864 --> 21:30.336
Get ready, guys.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.338
There's no telling what
kind of subhuman monster

21:32.425 --> 21:33.716
might come
through that door.

21:38.101 --> 21:39.311
It's even worse
than I thought.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.539
Cass!

21:41.028 --> 21:43.152
Thank goodness
you're safe!

21:43.731 --> 21:45.200
Are you all right?

21:45.309 --> 21:46.886
Where were you?

21:47.528 --> 21:48.874
I'm fine, Rapunzel.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.541
Let's get
movin', huh?

21:52.206 --> 21:53.787
Oh, okay then.

21:54.091 --> 21:55.778
Time to hit the road.

21:56.095 --> 21:58.528
Destiny calls!
