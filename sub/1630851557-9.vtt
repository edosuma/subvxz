WEBVTT

00:21.063 --> 00:25.025
Well, that was delicious.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.652
My compliments to the chef.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.112
You were the chef.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.405
I know.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.949
I was complimenting me.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.494
So, now what?

00:36.078 --> 00:40.249
Now,
you're gonna help me finish that puzzle.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.211
It's way too many pieces for a man
who has lived by himself.

00:44.753 --> 00:45.838
Thank you, Rolf.

00:46.547 --> 00:52.010
So, you really might not attend
Don Pablo's memorial service?

00:52.553 --> 00:55.514
But he was like your mentor.

00:55.597 --> 01:00.894
Well, there will be some people there
who it will be awkward to see.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.272
Are you talking about Julia again?

01:03.355 --> 01:04.565
What do you mean, "again"?

01:04.647 --> 01:06.817
Dude, you're, like, obsessed with her.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.068
You keep saying…

01:08.151 --> 01:12.573
…"This is a story
about our family and a resort."

01:13.073 --> 01:14.366
But it's all about her.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.743
I think I should keep telling my story.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.663
Then you'll understand
it's not all about Julia.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.291
For example, this next part.

01:25.210 --> 01:29.423
Okay, this next part is all about Julia.
But it's a good one.

01:30.841 --> 01:34.720
The resort was gearing up
for its big New Year's Eve party.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.890
But we did have one evening to relax.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.893
…give our guests nothing but excellence.

01:40.976 --> 01:41.977
One last notice

01:42.060 --> 01:45.731
about tomorrow's Christmas staff dinner,
or posada.

01:45.814 --> 01:49.902
Now, I know traditionally it's always been
the one event of the year

01:49.985 --> 01:54.114
where all employees could bring a guest
with them to the dinner.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.574
This year…

01:58.660 --> 02:00.454
we will continue that tradition.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.333
Yeah!

02:04.917 --> 02:06.752
Why are we clapping
for getting what we always get?

02:06.835 --> 02:09.630
-I don't know, but she's good.
-Yeah.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.716
We've all been working so hard this year.

02:12.799 --> 02:16.136
Tomorrow I give you
the best "thank you" possible.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.554
Money, money, money.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.972
Time together.

02:19.056 --> 02:22.601
Plus, and I know this is
what you're really hoping for.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.186
-Money, money, money.
-Yes.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.480
I will sing you a Christmas song.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.816
See you all there, my fabulous darlings.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.569
Chad, will you remember to…

02:35.864 --> 02:38.283
Chad, shall we?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.381
-Hey!
-Hi.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.675
That looks amazing.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.009
I would totally wear that dress.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.469
Thank you.

02:57.553 --> 02:59.555
I just want to make sure
I impress Diane tomorrow.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.306
-That's right. Your big meeting.
-Yeah.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.308
-Are you nervous?
-Yes. I just--

03:03.392 --> 03:06.353
I can't believe she might actually
put my clothes in the resort store.

03:06.854 --> 03:07.980
And it's all because of Chad.

03:08.063 --> 03:11.900
I mean, how great was it of him to make
that dress from one of my designs?

03:12.401 --> 03:15.279
So great. Chad, what a guy.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.281
You know, even the custom tags he made.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.450
It just makes it feel like
it deserves to be at a store, you know?

03:20.951 --> 03:22.536
Hang on a second.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.912
How can you keep letting Chad

03:23.996 --> 03:26.290
take the credit
for the dress you had made?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.624
You're helping him win.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.085
Hey. Calm down, Hugo. Calm down.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.421
This chapter is all about Julia

03:32.504 --> 03:37.885
and how little by little,
she started to piece together the truth.

03:38.468 --> 03:42.639
Almost like she was doing… a puzzle.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.017
Oh, man.
Is that why we're doing this thing?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.310
How obvious.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.603
-No.
-This is a beautiful metaphor.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.354
-No.
-Just keep listening.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.732
Well,
I hope you're more successful with Diane

03:51.815 --> 03:53.901
than Grace Poole was
at keeping an eye on Bertha.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.446
Máximo, you've been reading Jane Eyre?
How far have you gotten?

03:58.655 --> 04:01.700
I'm at the part where she already met
the man she should be with,

04:02.201 --> 04:03.952
but right now, she's with the other guy.

04:07.289 --> 04:11.752
Piecing together the puzzle.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.631
Wait. That doesn't go there.

04:24.348 --> 04:25.891
Rosa, the next batch is coming up!

04:29.311 --> 04:29.811
Hi.

04:30.896 --> 04:31.939
Can I help you?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.107
I just got hired for the holiday season.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.567
Really?

04:35.984 --> 04:36.693
That's strange.

04:36.985 --> 04:37.444
Why?

04:37.694 --> 04:41.490
Usually they put the pretty people
out by the pool, or the bar,

04:41.573 --> 04:42.699
so the guests can see them.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.660
You think I'm pretty?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.080
Oh, um... I just meant...

04:48.247 --> 04:49.289
what I mean is...

04:50.165 --> 04:51.208
...can I show you around?

04:51.583 --> 04:52.167
Sure.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.043
So...

04:53.168 --> 04:54.837
These are the laundry machines.
And...

04:54.920 --> 04:56.630
here are more laundry machines...

04:57.005 --> 04:58.715
And that's pretty much it.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.384
How cute.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.682
This might seem forward,

05:07.349 --> 05:09.393
but do you think you'd like to hang out
at the staff dinner tomorrow night?

05:09.852 --> 05:10.894
That sounds fun.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.020
I'd love to.

05:13.438 --> 05:13.897
Hey,

05:14.022 --> 05:15.482
but I don't even know your name.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.442
Oh, excuse me.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.278
My name is Memo.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.988
I'm Lorena. Nice to meet you.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.324
So, what do I need to know
about the laundry room?

05:24.616 --> 05:27.619
Well, my only real advice is a warning.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.330
The woman who runs this place is horrible.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.376
She's like an ogre that escaped
from a toddler's nightmare.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.461
Do you want to know my nickname for her?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.172
Aunt Lupe!

05:38.297 --> 05:40.799
No, no, it's a little meaner than that,
but--

05:43.552 --> 05:45.429
Why are you talking to my niece?

05:46.638 --> 05:49.183
Memo asked me to the posada tomorrow.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.517
Isn't that sweet?

05:51.059 --> 05:52.060
So sweet.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.521
Go fill out your paperwork.

05:54.605 --> 05:55.063
Okay.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.398
I'll be back soon.

05:58.775 --> 05:59.318
So...

05:59.401 --> 06:01.612
should I call you Aunt Lupe, too, or--

06:03.739 --> 06:05.157
If you hurt her,

06:05.532 --> 06:07.117
I'll chop your balls off.

06:07.409 --> 06:07.951
Okay.

06:30.682 --> 06:31.934
Gabriela!

06:32.017 --> 06:33.519
Wait, wait, wait.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.395
Who's Gabriela?

06:35.479 --> 06:37.189
It's your teenage girlfriend.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.816
It's the first girl you ever kissed.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.693
Her name was Roberta.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.781
I've been calling her Gabriela
all this time.

06:45.906 --> 06:46.865
Roberta!

06:48.033 --> 06:49.284
What's going on here?!

06:49.785 --> 06:51.203
I knew you were a bad influence.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.498
Always sneaking around together,

06:54.873 --> 06:55.999
doing who knows what.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.168
There were rumors.
The neighbors were saying things.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.253
I didn't want to believe them--

06:59.711 --> 07:00.504
But now I know,

07:00.587 --> 07:02.214
and I will never let you two
near each other again!

07:02.714 --> 07:04.341
Mom, hang on!

07:04.925 --> 07:06.051
This is my fault.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.011
I've been deceiving you.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.640
For the past few weeks...

07:11.932 --> 07:13.225
Roberta and I have been dating.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.854
Sara was sneaking her out for me.

07:19.064 --> 07:19.773
I'm sorry.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.697
Roberta!

07:28.156 --> 07:29.700
This makes me happy.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.786
How precious!

07:33.495 --> 07:35.998
My son's girlfriend deserves
to walk out the front door!

07:37.749 --> 07:38.750
Bye Roberta!

07:39.209 --> 07:39.668
Bye!

07:41.295 --> 07:43.338
My son, dating my daughter's best friend.

07:44.173 --> 07:44.965
I know.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.758
Aren't we adorable?

07:50.596 --> 07:51.805
I'm just wondering...

07:53.891 --> 07:56.018
why was Roberta
sneaking out of the window...

07:56.602 --> 07:57.936
in Sara's bedroom,

07:58.478 --> 08:01.106
when your room is actually closer
to the front door?

08:03.734 --> 08:05.110
The front door!

08:05.694 --> 08:06.612
How dumb.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.447
I can't believe I forgot about that.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.541
What am I going to do?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.002
Mom is more suspicious than ever.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.420
That was a real close one.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.215
And with the nosy neighbors, I'll never
be able to spend time with Roberta.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.843
If Mom even sees us with each other again,
I'm scared what might happen to me.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.971
I wish I could change things for you,
Sarape.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.640
But I don't know how.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.897
But I can give you a night together!

08:42.481 --> 08:43.607
A night somewhere else,

08:43.690 --> 08:46.693
where you and Roberta
won't have to worry about Mom.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.320
What are you talking about?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.072
Tomorrow night,

08:50.155 --> 08:52.449
you both can come to my work's posada.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.952
You can talk, and dance, and feel relaxed.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.162
I'll pretend that Roberta is my date,

08:57.538 --> 08:59.081
and you can pretend that Memo is yours.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.667
Now way, that would be amazing!

09:02.668 --> 09:04.461
But what if Memo already has a date?

09:04.878 --> 09:05.879
That's funny!

09:05.963 --> 09:08.382
But I would know
if Memo already had a date...

09:10.425 --> 09:11.885
That is funny!

09:11.969 --> 09:16.056
But I do already have a date.
Lorena. She's new here.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.225
Seriously?

09:18.308 --> 09:21.895
Okay, you can blow off my sister
the second you get to the dinner.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.898
I just need you to convince my mom
that you're taking Sara.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.486
And Sara will be okay with that?
I don't want to hurt her feelings.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.530
I know she has a crush on me.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.616
I think she'll be all right.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.952
Just trust me.
I'm doing the same with Roberta.

09:37.035 --> 09:41.373
I can't explain why.
Just know this is really important.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.917
Fine.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.462
-As long as I can ditch her at the dinner.
-Ditch who at the dinner?

09:49.214 --> 09:53.302
Ditch any lady that comes near me.
Since I'll be with you, Lolo.

10:01.894 --> 10:05.063
As you can see, my designs work both
at the beach and in the club.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.149
And at an attractive price point too.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.526
Your guests will love to support
a locally made product,

10:09.610 --> 10:13.238
but without sacrificing the quality
and style that they deserve.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.866
You know who you remind me of?

10:16.992 --> 10:20.120
Ximena, the other woman at the front desk
you always confuse me with?

10:20.704 --> 10:21.997
Yes.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.373
But also me.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.294
When I was your age,
I was just as ambitious as you are.

10:27.878 --> 10:30.464
And that's a good thing, right?

10:30.547 --> 10:32.841
Darling, it's fabulous.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.718
Tell you what.

10:34.801 --> 10:39.056
Why don't we try a small number of dresses
in our store on a trial basis?

10:39.139 --> 10:42.434
If they sell,
we'll talk about carrying your line.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.563
Oh, my God. Diane, thank you so much.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.273
How fast can you get a dozen made?

10:48.357 --> 10:51.652
I'll speak to my seamstress.
I'll also ask Chad about his dress person.

10:52.778 --> 10:54.279
Chad doesn't have a dress person.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.741
He had this dress made for me.

10:58.325 --> 11:02.371
I can assure you wherever Chad got it,
it wasn't his idea.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.585
Have a great stay.

11:08.669 --> 11:09.753
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.380
-Hey, Máximo.
-Hey, Ximena.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.631
I have to rush home

11:12.714 --> 11:14.758
and pick up my sister
for the dinner tonight,

11:14.842 --> 11:16.343
but they are cleaning the locker room.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.846
-Can I leave my bag here for a few hours?
-Yeah, sure.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.013
I'll pick it up tonight.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.478
Thanks.

11:26.562 --> 11:27.563
Bye.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.401
I love you, Máximo Gallardo.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.736
Really? She said that?

11:34.820 --> 11:36.321
She probably did.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.875
I can't believe I'm actually going to
sell my dresses in the store.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.585
You know, I'm so psyched for you.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.503
You know, it's not easy to impress my mom.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.214
I mean, I wouldn't know.
I've never impressed her.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.928
By the way,
where did you go get this dress made?

12:00.012 --> 12:01.555
I'm going to need help making these.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.349
You know,
I got it from the--

12:06.059 --> 12:08.395
You know what? I am--
I am blanking.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.315
I'm gonna go see my mom at the dinner.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.859
I'll see you there.

12:14.193 --> 12:15.360
-Excuse me.
-Okay,

12:15.444 --> 12:18.322
I know people never actually
talk to themselves out loud,

12:18.405 --> 12:21.033
but I'd like to think
that right around this moment,

12:21.116 --> 12:22.409
Julia said to herself…

12:23.035 --> 12:26.663
If the dress wasn't Chad's idea,
then whose idea was it?

12:27.664 --> 12:30.834
This is like a puzzle.
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

12:32.211 --> 12:34.338
Yes, that's a beautiful metaphor.

12:51.522 --> 12:52.272
How do I look?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.441
Dude, your sisters are all seamstresses.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.401
None of them could fix your shirt?

12:57.027 --> 12:59.071
Their specialty is dresses.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.615
Would you ask a chef to cook you a chair?

13:03.408 --> 13:05.035
Now I'd better break the news to Sara.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.580
Would you give us a moment?

13:08.664 --> 13:09.039
Sure.

13:09.164 --> 13:09.540
Thanks.

13:11.959 --> 13:12.543
Sara...

13:13.961 --> 13:17.339
I hate, hate, hate to break
your little heart like this,

13:17.422 --> 13:19.716
your brother might have warned you, but...

13:20.843 --> 13:21.885
I've met someone.

13:22.219 --> 13:25.097
She's finishing her shift
in the laundry room

13:25.180 --> 13:26.348
and will be here in an hour, so--

13:26.431 --> 13:26.807
Cool.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.232
Your little sister is so strong.

13:47.536 --> 13:48.537
Pablo?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.497
Nora.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.208
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

13:53.292 --> 13:54.042
Not really.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.419
I'm...

13:55.711 --> 13:57.838
getting ready for tomorrow's trip.

13:58.589 --> 14:01.758
I haven't been to Mexico City
since the Pope came in 1979.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.385
That's actually why I'm here.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.096
I wanted to...

14:06.346 --> 14:09.391
thank you for telling me
about my grandson.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.602
It was a great surprise for me.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.813
I have a gift for him
and a letter for my son.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.316
I know it's a lot to ask, but...

14:17.983 --> 14:18.901
if you have time,

14:18.984 --> 14:21.945
when you are in Mexico City,
before your eye surgery...

14:22.029 --> 14:24.573
Could you consider bringing it to them?

14:25.782 --> 14:28.202
It's a teddy bear,

14:28.535 --> 14:29.828
with a red jacket.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.165
Victor had one like this one.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.625
Yes, I remember!

14:34.958 --> 14:36.418
So sweet.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.462
I will try, Pablo.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.633
I also want to tell you that...

14:43.425 --> 14:46.678
I regret the way I behaved
these past years.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.057
I believe I've hurt many people.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.476
Including you.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.896
I am sorry.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.068
You made a big mess.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.405
But I don't think it was all your fault,
Pablo.

15:05.531 --> 15:08.242
I think it was also that hotel
that changes people.

15:08.825 --> 15:09.993
You know that.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.081
That's why I'm scared
of Máximo working there.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.916
I understand what you mean.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.544
But there are also wonderful,

15:19.169 --> 15:21.171
and hard-working people like your son.

15:22.631 --> 15:24.341
I believe if you met,

15:24.424 --> 15:25.342
if...

15:25.425 --> 15:27.135
you spent some time there,

15:28.262 --> 15:29.847
you would see this more clearly.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.725
I wish I could but,

15:34.184 --> 15:35.769
I don't see anything clearly!

15:39.147 --> 15:40.148
Hi, Xime.

15:40.524 --> 15:41.400
Hi, Julia.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.569
You look fantastic.

15:43.652 --> 15:44.653
Thank you.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.489
Where is my lip pencil?

16:15.893 --> 16:16.894
Máximo.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.814
Now that Julia knew
the truth about the dress,

16:20.898 --> 16:24.234
she could start working on
the next part of the puzzle.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.196
Who should she be with?

16:27.946 --> 16:28.947
Chad…

16:31.617 --> 16:32.618
Or me?

16:49.092 --> 16:50.594
Wow, I love your dress!

16:50.928 --> 16:52.346
Thanks, it's my own design.

16:52.513 --> 16:53.805
You made that?!

16:53.889 --> 16:55.474
No, my boyfriend made it for me.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.352
Actually...

16:59.228 --> 17:01.396
I just realized someone else made it.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.065
A friend who...

17:03.148 --> 17:04.441
I sometimes feel might be...

17:05.025 --> 17:06.193
...more than a friend...

17:07.694 --> 17:11.281
Don't get me wrong!
My boyfriend is great, he's just not...

17:12.156 --> 17:15.618
he's just not the type of person
who would think of something like this.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.329
While this friend...

17:18.914 --> 17:20.332
does think of stuff like this.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.333
Constantly.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.795
Shit. I'm so confused!

17:25.503 --> 17:28.006
Which explains why I'm saying
all this in a bathroom to a stranger

17:28.089 --> 17:29.424
like a crazy person.

17:29.883 --> 17:33.470
We all know the best advice
comes from women's restrooms.

17:34.805 --> 17:36.640
And I totally get what you're feeling.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.725
I was recently confused too.

17:38.809 --> 17:41.520
I didn't know if I might be
more than just friends with someone.

17:42.646 --> 17:43.981
But I followed my heart,

17:44.189 --> 17:46.275
and now I'm with the perfect person
for me.

17:46.650 --> 17:47.693
I'm happy.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.696
So... follow your intuition.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.908
You're amazing. Thank you, um... ?

17:54.992 --> 17:56.201
Gabriela.

17:56.285 --> 17:57.244
Roberta.

17:57.995 --> 17:59.162
Roberta.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.247
Julia.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.502
Okay.

18:17.598 --> 18:21.560
-Máximo, can we talk?
-Absolutely. What's going on?

18:22.019 --> 18:22.728
No way!

18:22.895 --> 18:23.770
Don Pablo's here...

18:23.937 --> 18:24.730
with my mom?!

18:24.813 --> 18:26.899
Really? I would love to meet her.

18:27.024 --> 18:27.858
No, you don't get it.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.443
If she's here,
there must be something bad happening.

18:29.526 --> 18:30.277
Very, very bad!

18:30.527 --> 18:30.986
Um...

18:31.069 --> 18:31.570
so...

18:31.862 --> 18:32.738
Let's catch up later, okay?

18:34.198 --> 18:37.159
I couldn't let my mom see
Sara and Roberta together.

18:37.492 --> 18:38.827
Mom! What are you doing here?

18:38.911 --> 18:40.537
Remember last time you brought me?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.331
I ran into my old friend, Pablo.

18:42.623 --> 18:43.373
He invited me.

18:43.874 --> 18:44.541
Don Pablo?

18:45.584 --> 18:46.335
You are friends with Don Pablo?

18:46.418 --> 18:46.710
Yes!

18:46.793 --> 18:49.171
Why didn't you tell me you knew my boss?

18:49.338 --> 18:51.089
If you had told me your boss was Pablo --

18:51.173 --> 18:51.882
Don Pablo!

18:51.965 --> 18:52.925
I would have told you.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.593
But you never tell me anything
about your job,

18:54.676 --> 18:56.011
you leave so early in the morning,

18:56.094 --> 18:57.179
you come home so late at night,

18:57.262 --> 18:58.138
smelling like shame!

18:58.222 --> 19:00.474
I told you that smell is chlorine!

19:03.810 --> 19:04.561
But anyway,

19:05.020 --> 19:07.523
he invited me to the dinner, so here I am!

19:08.273 --> 19:09.358
Let me bring you something to drink!

19:09.650 --> 19:10.609
Wait here.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.239
Beto, can I have some punch?

19:15.697 --> 19:16.740
What are we gonna do?!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.992
This is so bad.
Mom will find out I'm with Roberta --

19:19.076 --> 19:20.786
Don't worry, I won't abandon you,

19:20.869 --> 19:21.537
I promise.

19:23.705 --> 19:24.081
Memo!

19:24.623 --> 19:25.332
My mom is here!

19:25.541 --> 19:27.793
So you need to keep pretending
to be Sara's date.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.086
Alright.

19:29.670 --> 19:32.005
But Lorena's shift ends in 40 minutes.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.507
So this won't be for very long.

19:33.924 --> 19:36.093
I'll make sure she's gone by then.

19:36.510 --> 19:37.219
Do the arm thing.

19:38.887 --> 19:39.263
Thanks.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.226
To be honest,
temptation is what worries me.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.103
Here it is, Mom.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.729
Thank you.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.858
Now you two are talking.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.150
That's cool, and strange.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.944
Yes, we just met.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.654
She's lovely!

19:56.989 --> 19:58.657
I was asking Julia,

19:58.740 --> 20:02.744
would you say there's good,
hard working people here at the hotel?

20:03.954 --> 20:05.038
I think so.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.375
Roberta!

20:09.042 --> 20:09.835
Doña Nora!

20:10.335 --> 20:11.378
Roberta.

20:11.503 --> 20:12.171
This is Julia.

20:12.504 --> 20:12.963
Oh hey!

20:13.213 --> 20:14.381
We actually just met.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.968
Roberta is Máximo's girlfriend.
Aren't they adorable?

20:22.389 --> 20:23.765
Why don't we sit together for dinner?

20:26.476 --> 20:27.019
Yes, yes!

20:27.436 --> 20:28.020
Come, dear.

20:28.103 --> 20:28.645
Let's go.

20:32.065 --> 20:32.983
What do I do?

20:33.400 --> 20:36.612
I'm on a fake date
in front of the girl I actually like.

20:36.987 --> 20:37.696
This is horrible.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.573
No, it's actually good.

20:40.490 --> 20:44.661
I've seen my sisters reject suitors
when they beg.

20:45.329 --> 20:47.289
But as soon as the guys find a girlfriend,

20:47.581 --> 20:50.626
my sisters suddenly realize
they were always in love with them.

20:51.919 --> 20:54.922
Just show Julia what she's missing,
and you will see.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.301
You really do know about women.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.137
It's all about confidence.

21:03.555 --> 21:04.223
Lorena!

21:05.098 --> 21:06.350
What are you doing here?

21:06.558 --> 21:08.310
My Aunt Lupe and I finished early.

21:08.519 --> 21:09.520
What are you wearing?

21:09.603 --> 21:11.021
This is a Posada...

21:11.104 --> 21:12.606
Not "The Gong Show".

21:13.732 --> 21:14.983
Máximo, Memo...

21:15.067 --> 21:17.027
Tell your friends to join us.

21:17.236 --> 21:18.862
Go on, we'll catch up soon!

21:21.949 --> 21:22.741
What the hell, Máximo!

21:22.824 --> 21:23.367
What am I going to do?

21:23.534 --> 21:26.578
I'm on a fake date
in front of the girl I actually like!

21:26.662 --> 21:27.246
But you just told me --

21:27.329 --> 21:27.955
No, no, no.

21:28.372 --> 21:30.374
Don't you dare throw that back in my face.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.211
Why can't I read this joke?
I think it's funny.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.462
I don't know, it just seems a little…

21:36.380 --> 21:37.381
-Edgy?
-… offensive.

21:37.965 --> 21:40.884
It would kill on Carson. Did you at least
get the sheet music for my song?

21:40.968 --> 21:41.969
Damn it.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.556
Great. Now how will the mariachi band
know what to play?

21:45.639 --> 21:47.933
-Damn it!
-You forgot the mariachi band?

21:48.016 --> 21:50.978
-I'm sorry. I was just a little--
-Distracted. As usual.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.813
Come see me in my office.

21:59.987 --> 22:03.448
My mom being at dinner
made everything more complicated.

22:04.825 --> 22:09.371
While I was figuring out how to tell Julia
that Roberta wasn't really my girlfriend,

22:10.038 --> 22:13.834
Memo was figuring out
how to be on two dates at once.

22:14.835 --> 22:17.129
Look at how nervous Memo is.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.381
Don't they make a lovely couple?

22:20.924 --> 22:22.509
Sure, adorable.

22:24.553 --> 22:27.347
Memo, get closer to take a photo.

22:33.812 --> 22:35.355
You better treat her well.

22:35.439 --> 22:36.023
You hear me?

22:50.454 --> 22:51.663
How long have you been dating?

22:51.747 --> 22:52.831
Well, how long?

22:52.915 --> 22:54.082
A few weeks, right?

23:00.088 --> 23:03.342
You can be someone's friend for so long,

23:03.800 --> 23:05.969
and suddenly, out of nowhere,
everything makes sense.

23:06.970 --> 23:07.804
Yes.

23:07.888 --> 23:10.849
That night we watched a movie,
and shared our first kiss,

23:12.351 --> 23:13.936
was the best moment in my life.

23:15.854 --> 23:17.064
I'm a very competent kisser.

23:19.191 --> 23:20.400
Me too.

23:26.198 --> 23:29.368
Okay. I found one mariachi.
Or is it one mariacho?

23:29.451 --> 23:32.079
Another year's almost over
and I really don't get it, Chad.

23:32.579 --> 23:33.664
You're coasting at work.

23:33.747 --> 23:36.041
You spend all your free time
with your girlfriend.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.543
What do you want in life?

23:37.626 --> 23:40.045
Because I'm your mother
and I really have no clue.

23:40.128 --> 23:43.131
Well, I don't know either.
I'm still trying to figure it out.

23:43.715 --> 23:47.219
You know, it's not always easy
living up to the Diane Davies brand.

23:49.221 --> 23:51.557
You're right. I'm sure that isn't easy.

23:53.642 --> 23:55.310
You know what's also not easy?

23:57.062 --> 24:00.357
Being called a washed-up actress
when I was younger than you are now.

24:01.149 --> 24:04.987
Raising a son by myself
while tabloids mocked me

24:05.070 --> 24:07.614
for keeping silent
about who the father was

24:07.698 --> 24:09.992
because I knew that was best for you.

24:12.119 --> 24:15.080
I started at the bottom,
and I clawed my way up here.

24:16.456 --> 24:20.252
You started at the top
and you're just kind of floating.

24:21.837 --> 24:25.215
So, I'll ask you again.
What do you want in life?

24:28.552 --> 24:30.971
Guess I just want you to be proud of me.

24:34.224 --> 24:36.018
We have a Christmas carol to sing.

24:41.607 --> 24:43.775
If you'll excuse me,
it's time for me to go.

24:43.859 --> 24:45.068
It was lovely meeting all of you.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.486
Thank you, Julia.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.947
It's nice to know
there are good people at the resort.

24:49.031 --> 24:50.324
Pablo was right.

24:50.407 --> 24:51.408
Don Pablo!

24:51.491 --> 24:52.910
Oh, and I love your dress!

24:53.076 --> 24:54.369
Thank you so much.

24:54.953 --> 24:57.247
It was a gift from someone very special.

24:59.208 --> 25:00.125
Until next time. Enjoy your evening.

25:00.292 --> 25:01.335
Such a nice girl.

25:02.336 --> 25:03.754
It's actually me who had it made for her.

25:04.087 --> 25:04.630
What?

25:05.047 --> 25:05.923
It's sort of a secret.

25:06.423 --> 25:07.299
Julia knows it was you.

25:07.925 --> 25:08.550
No she doesn't.

25:08.634 --> 25:09.843
But maybe someday she will.

25:10.093 --> 25:10.219
But-

25:10.302 --> 25:11.178
She does know!

25:11.428 --> 25:12.596
She told me earlier.

25:13.013 --> 25:13.972
Julia knows it was you.

25:14.056 --> 25:14.973
And she likes you!

25:15.057 --> 25:15.599
What?

25:18.769 --> 25:19.436
Go talk to her!

25:19.686 --> 25:20.979
No, I can't leave you and Sara alone.

25:21.355 --> 25:22.189
If something goes wrong...

25:22.272 --> 25:24.608
If everyone could take their seats,
please.

25:25.108 --> 25:25.567
Go!

25:25.734 --> 25:26.777
No, I'm not leaving you.

25:28.487 --> 25:30.447
You two are such a cute couple.

25:30.656 --> 25:34.826
Welcome everyone to our posada!

25:38.872 --> 25:40.874
Yeah, maybe that is a little offensive.

25:42.334 --> 25:45.254
Thank you, everyone,
for another wonderful year.

25:45.337 --> 25:48.590
And a very special thanks to my son, Chad.

25:49.424 --> 25:53.762
Chad, honey. This year would you be a doll
and get up here and sing with me?

26:08.652 --> 26:10.070
Excuse me, just one moment.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.116
Everyone was unhappy.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.785
We were all stuck at that table.

26:16.869 --> 26:20.122
None of us close to the person
we wanted to be with.

26:21.540 --> 26:22.541
And then…

26:23.750 --> 26:25.169
what happened next,

26:26.587 --> 26:29.381
was something that surprised everyone.

26:32.009 --> 26:33.302
What's Lupe doing?

26:33.468 --> 26:34.428
Where is she going?

27:18.013 --> 27:19.389
You can't see?

27:19.473 --> 27:21.850
Not really, but she sings beautifully.

27:54.925 --> 27:56.009
We'll be alright.

27:56.802 --> 27:58.053
Thank you!

28:36.967 --> 28:37.759
Máximo!

28:39.052 --> 28:40.637
How did you know I'd be here?

28:41.180 --> 28:42.389
Because we have a connection.

28:44.558 --> 28:46.059
Also, this is the seventh place
I looked for you.

28:48.437 --> 28:49.855
Listen, about Roberta...

28:50.564 --> 28:51.315
I talked to her earlier.

28:51.940 --> 28:52.816
She seems wonderful.

28:53.025 --> 28:54.109
I'm happy for you.

28:55.068 --> 28:56.361
She's somebody else's girlfriend,

28:56.862 --> 28:57.905
I was just covering for them.

28:58.739 --> 29:01.033
You're the only one I want to be with.

29:16.507 --> 29:17.090
What is it?

29:17.883 --> 29:18.842
You were right.

29:19.218 --> 29:20.594
You are a very competent kisser.
