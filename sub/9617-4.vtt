WEBVTT

00:06.841 --> 00:09.258
SOMEBODY READ THAT.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.676
"HISTORY WILL BE KIND TO ME
FOR I INTEND TO WRITE IT."
WINSTON CHURCHILL.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.379
AND HE DID.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.314
WHO'S GONNA WRITE
THEIR OWN HISTORY HERE?

00:16.250 --> 00:18.183
WHAT IS HISTORY?
I KEEP FORGETTING.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.952
HISTORY IS TIME PASSING.

00:19.954 --> 00:21.754
OH, YEAH?
HOW MUCH TIME?

00:21.756 --> 00:25.824
SOMEONE ONCE SAID,
"100 YEARS FROM NOW,
ALL NEW PEOPLE."

00:25.826 --> 00:27.226
-100 YEARS.
-WRONG.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.361
YOU SET ME UP.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.930
WHEN SHOULD YOU GUYS BEGIN
TO MAKE YOUR OWN HISTORY?

00:31.932 --> 00:33.365
-RIGHT NOW.
-GOOD.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.768
SO, TODAY WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT WINSTON CHURCHILL.

00:35.770 --> 00:38.670
WHEN THE NEW PEOPLE COME,
HOW DO YOU WANT THEM
TALKING ABOUT YOU?

00:38.672 --> 00:40.205
NICELY?

00:41.876 --> 00:44.643
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE BEFORE
HISTORY MAKES ITS DECISION
ABOUT US?

00:44.645 --> 00:45.978
WHAT IF THEY'RE WRITING
IT DOWN NOW?

00:45.980 --> 00:47.663
DOESN'T MATTER.

00:47.664 --> 00:49.347
CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION.
PLEASE READ.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.586
"THERE IS A COMFORT IN KNOWING
THAT HISTORY IS FIXED.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.321
"YOU CAN NO SOONER
CHANGE HISTORY

00:56.323 --> 00:58.891
"THAN YOU CAN CHANGE THE NINE
PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

00:58.893 --> 01:00.659
"FROM MERCURY TO PLUTO."

01:01.695 --> 01:04.363
All: OH...

01:04.365 --> 01:05.297
WHAT?

01:05.299 --> 01:07.533
NICE JOB, MR. MATTHEWS.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.135
WHAT'D HE DO?

01:09.136 --> 01:10.736
HE JUST SHOWED US
HISTORY BOOKS CAN BE WRONG.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.804
YOU CAN CHANGE HISTORY.

01:11.806 --> 01:13.238
I DON'T GET IT.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.406
HOW CAN SHE NOT KNOW?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.641
LOOK AT THE BIRD!

01:17.411 --> 01:19.812
-SHE DOESN'T KNOW BECAUSE
SHE HAS US.
-THE RILEY COMMITTEE.

01:19.814 --> 01:22.381
THE COMMITTEE EXISTS TO KEEP
CERTAIN INFORMATION AWAY
FROM RILEY.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.417
-LIKE WHAT?
-EVERYTHING, REALLY.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.452
LISTEN, THIS COMMITTEE CAN'T
PROTECT HER FOR THE REST
OF HER LIFE.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.486
SHE'S GETTING TOO SMART.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.854
SHE'S LOOKING FOR A BIRD.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.658
WELL, SOMEONE'S GOTTA
TELL HER.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.460
-YOU DO IT.
-NAH...

01:34.462 --> 01:36.495
YOU DO IT!

01:36.497 --> 01:38.430
-HI, SWEETIE.
-PEACHES.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.934
SEE, WE'VE ALL BEEN PROTECTING
YOU FROM SOMETHING.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.001
YOU KNOW PLUTO?

01:43.003 --> 01:45.737
PLUTO? I LOVE PLUTO.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.372
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.774
PLUTO'S A LITTLE
CUTIE-PIE.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.909
THE SMALLEST PLANET
WITH THE BIGGEST HEART.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.711
I LOVE PLUTO SO MUCH,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.513
I WOULD KISS IT ON THE FACE.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.048
-NOT DOING IT!
-YOU'RE DOING IT!

01:56.050 --> 01:57.382
-HONEY?
-PEACHES?

01:58.619 --> 02:02.988
PLUTO IS NOT A PLANET ANYMORE.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.325
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY?

02:06.327 --> 02:09.428
THEY MADE
A SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY

02:09.430 --> 02:11.630
THAT PLUTO'S NOT
A PLANET ANYMORE.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.466
WILL YOU BE OKAY?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.936
I'M FINE.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.772
I AM TOO OLD NOW TO FLIP OUT
OVER SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.910
DAD, PLEASE CONTINUE.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.445
YOU SURE, SWEETIE?

02:26.447 --> 02:28.480
PLEASE, CONTINUE.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.015
OKAY.

02:30.017 --> 02:32.801
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

02:32.802 --> 02:35.586
SO, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHO WE ARE NOW, AND WHO
WE HOPE TO BE SOMEDAY.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.991
HOW WILL WE WRITE OUR OWN
HISTORY AND DECIDE WHAT'S
IMPORTANT TO US?

02:38.993 --> 02:41.393
THEY FOUND A 100-YEAR-OLD
TIME CAPSULE IN BOSTON
LAST WEEK.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.427
COULD WE DO ONE OF THOSE?

02:42.429 --> 02:43.896
I LOVE THAT IDEA, FARKLE.

02:43.898 --> 02:47.332
IN FACT, WE DID ONE OF THOSE
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.402
WE WERE GONNA SEE WHAT BECAME
OF US IN 15 YEARS.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.004
WAIT A MINUTE...

02:52.006 --> 02:54.506
WE WERE GONNA SEE WHAT
BECAME OF US RIGHT NOW!

02:54.508 --> 02:57.743
15 YEARS IS RIGHT NOW.

02:57.745 --> 03:01.513
WE WERE GONNA GO BACK
AND SEE HOW MUCH WE'VE CHANGED.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.550
YEAH, WELL, I HOPE SOME OF US
NEVER DO.

PROMISE ME WE ARE NOT DRIVING
TO PHILADELPHIA TO DIG UP
STUFF FROM 15 YEARS AGO.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.579
I PROMISE.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.581
WHERE ARE THE SHOVELS
FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

04:11.085 --> 04:12.451
WE DON'T HAVE SHOVELS.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.819
WELL, WHERE WOULD ONE
BUY THESE SHOVELS?

04:13.821 --> 04:15.887
THE HARDWARE STORE,
IF ONE WAS GOING TO BUY SHOVELS,

04:15.889 --> 04:17.956
BUT ONE ISN'T.

04:17.957 --> 04:20.024
WELL, WHERE WOULD ONE FIND
THIS "HARDWARE STORE"
IF ONE WAS?

04:21.128 --> 04:22.928
PROMISE ME YOU'RE NOT
COMING BACK HERE WITH SHOVELS.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.897
I PROMISE YOU I AM NOT
COMING BACK HERE WITH SHOVELS.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.566
THEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

04:27.568 --> 04:28.734
I THINK YOU KNOW.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.670
SAY IT!

04:31.672 --> 04:33.205
SHOVELS!

04:37.011 --> 04:38.777
HOW CAN THEY
JUST DO THAT?

04:39.780 --> 04:42.481
SHE WORKS HER WHOLE LIFE
TO BECOME A PLANET,

04:42.483 --> 04:44.182
AND THEN IT'S JUST
TAKEN AWAY FROM HER.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.752
DO OUR HOPES AND DREAMS
EVEN MATTER?

04:46.754 --> 04:49.087
WELL, IN 15 YEARS,
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.590
A BUFFALO NICKEL.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING
IN THE TIME CAPSULE?

04:51.592 --> 04:53.558
YEAH, MY GRANDFATHER
GAVE IT TO ME FOR---

04:55.162 --> 04:57.195
ANYWAY, MY GRANDFATHER
GAVE IT TO ME.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.631
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
FOR WHAT?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.099
PAPPY JOE GAVE IT TO YOU
FOR WHAT?

05:01.101 --> 05:03.502
DON'T CALL HIS GRANDFATHER
PAPPY JOE.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.971
IT ACTUALLY WAS PAPPY JOE.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.074
YOU KNEW THAT?

05:09.075 --> 05:10.541
EH, IT WOULD'VE
BEEN ANYTHING I SAID.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.644
WHY'D HE GIVE YOU
THE NICKEL? WHY?

05:12.646 --> 05:15.681
NOTHING. HE GAVE IT TO ME
FOR BEING A GOOD LITTLE BOY.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.083
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
TELL US.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.218
I WAS A LITTLE KID,

05:20.220 --> 05:22.220
I WANT TO A KIDDIE RODEO,

05:22.222 --> 05:24.623
AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO MADE IT THE WHOLE
EIGHT SECONDS.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.891
YOU RODE A BULL?

05:25.893 --> 05:27.492
IT WAS SORT OF
LIKE A BULL.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.627
HERE COMES FUNNY.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.761
I RODE A SHEEP.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.029
(laughing)

05:31.031 --> 05:33.665
IT'S A REAL THING!
IT'S CALLED MUTTON BUSTING.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.934
RILEY, YOU'RE LAUGHING AT ME?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.569
NO...

05:39.239 --> 05:40.972
I WANTED TO BE A RODEO STAR.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.742
BUT, I GOT OLDER
AND GAVE UP ON IT.

05:43.744 --> 05:48.714
AWW, DON'T EVER GIVE UP
ON YOUR SHEEP RIDING DREAMS.

05:48.716 --> 05:53.185
YOU GO OUT THERE, AND YOU BECOME
THE BEST SHEEP RIDER THE WORLD
HAS EVER SEEN.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.653
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.021
AS LONG AS I'M HERE,

05:56.023 --> 05:59.257
I'VE DECIDED TO GIVE OUT
VALUABLE LIFE-LIVING ADVICE.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.910
LIKE CORY AND TOPANGA.

06:01.911 --> 06:04.562
SO, YOU ALL COME TO ME
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING LOST
IN THIS WORLD,

06:04.565 --> 06:05.864
AND I'M GONNA FIX YOU
RIGHT UP.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.666
NAH, WE'RE GOOD.

06:07.668 --> 06:12.003
DO NOT LET YOUR SHEEP-RIDING
DISAPPOINTMENT

06:12.005 --> 06:14.573
PREVENT YOU FROM
DREAMING DREAMS.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.943
AS I LOOK BACK AT MY LIFE,

06:17.944 --> 06:20.178
THE ONLY REGRETS I HAVE
ARE THE DREAMS I GAVE UP ON
TOO SOON.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.883
WOW. THANK YOU.
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.685
YES, IT IS!

06:26.687 --> 06:30.021
HEY, NICE TROPHY,
THE FARKLE.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.623
THANKS, THE MAYA'S MOM.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.592
IT'S MY SCIENCE FAIR
LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.694
FORGET SCIENCE,
YOU DREAM DREAMS!

06:35.696 --> 06:38.230
-BUT--
-OKAY.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.633
WHAT ARE YOU
PUTTING IN, MAYA?

06:41.635 --> 06:43.702
NOTHING. NO HOPES,
NO DISAPPOINTMENTS.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.103
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

06:45.105 --> 06:46.905
I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR ME

06:46.907 --> 06:49.040
TO CARE ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT'S SO FAR AWAY.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.976
BUT, I DO.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.011
I'M PUTTING IN PLUTO.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.680
WELL, IT'S SMALL ENOUGH. HA!

06:57.251 --> 06:58.316
TOO SOON?

07:10.230 --> 07:12.030
BACK FROM THE HARDWARE STORE,
ARE WE?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.598
SHOVEL.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.699
HMM...

07:22.009 --> 07:23.975
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
DRAG SHAWN INTO THIS?

07:23.977 --> 07:26.011
I DID NOT DRAG SHAWN
INTO THIS.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.145
(banging on the door)

07:27.147 --> 07:28.346
WHO'S THAT?

07:28.348 --> 07:30.282
I THINK YOU KNOW.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.718
TOPANGA, YOU ALL RIGHT?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.120
YEAH, I'M FINE, SHAWN.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.656
OH, THEN IT'S CORY.
OH MY GOSH, IT'S YOU.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.324
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO THE DOCTORS SAY?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.826
HOW LONG DOES HE HAVE
TO LIVE?

07:44.698 --> 07:45.797
NOT LONG.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.469
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.671
WE ARE GONNA DO EVERYTHING
WE'VE EVER DREAMED OF,

07:52.673 --> 07:55.740
AND IN WHATEVER TIME YOU HAVE
LEFT, WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.243
WE'RE GONNA GO TO YOUR
FAVORITE RESTAURANT,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE ALL THE ROLLS.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.413
THEY WANT YOU
TO TAKE THE ROLLS.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.767
NO!

08:05.768 --> 08:08.152
OH, IT'S OKAY, SHAWN,
I BOUGHT THE SHOVELS MYSELF.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.256
CORY, PAY THE MONEY.
HAVE THE PROFESSIONALS DIG.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.327
SHAWN, HE'S FINE.
EVERYBODY'S FINE.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.729
NO. HE'S NOT FINE.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.899
HE CALLED ME OVER HERE,
SAID IT WAS A MATTER
OF LIFE OR DEATH.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.234
HE'S NOT FINE.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.403
I HAD TO MAKE SURE YOU'D COME.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.206
NOBODY BYE-BYE?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.141
EVERYBODY WHOOP-DI-WHOO!

08:32.312 --> 08:34.129
WHY AM I HERE?

08:34.130 --> 08:35.947
CORY REMEMBERED
THE TIME CAPSULE
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.833
IT'S 15 YEARS.

08:37.834 --> 08:39.718
HE WANTS TO DRIVE
TO PHILADELPHIA
TO DIG IT UP.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.887
OH...

08:43.991 --> 08:45.423
OKAY.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.996
WHATCHA DOING WITH
THAT SHOVEL, BUDDY?

08:50.998 --> 08:52.764
I WAS IN PHILADELPHIA!

08:52.766 --> 08:55.233
(yelling)

08:59.773 --> 09:00.872
ROAD TRIP!

09:00.874 --> 09:02.841
WHO WANTS TO GO
INSTEAD OF ME?

09:02.843 --> 09:05.076
I'LL GO.
I'LL DO ANYTHING
WITH ANYBODY.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.928
NO DEAL.

09:06.929 --> 09:08.779
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM
IN THE CAR FOR YOU
AND ALL YOUR WORDS.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.266
WHAT'S THIS HERE?

09:11.267 --> 09:12.750
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE PUTTING
IN OUR TIME CAPSULE.

09:12.753 --> 09:13.818
OH...

09:15.355 --> 09:16.755
NOPE. NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.223
THESE THINGS
ARE IMPORTANT TO US.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.541
WHY ARE THERE ONLY
THREE OF THEM?

09:19.542 --> 09:20.858
-I'M NOT PLAYING.
-OH, YOU'RE PLAYING!

09:20.861 --> 09:22.727
-NICE SHOVEL SHIRT.
-THEY GOT PLENTY LEFT.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.795
I DON'T SEE HOW.

09:25.832 --> 09:26.865
MR. SHAWN.

09:26.867 --> 09:27.999
MISS KATY.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.101
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW'S THE WRITING?

09:30.103 --> 09:32.070
WELL, I WAS DOING A STORY
IN PHILADELPHIA

09:32.072 --> 09:34.339
TILL MY FRIEND HERE
BROUGHT ME TO NEW YORK

09:34.341 --> 09:36.341
SO WE COULD GO BACK
TO PHILADELPHIA.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.610
HOW'S THE ACTING?

09:38.611 --> 09:40.878
I WAS PLAYING A WAITRESS
AT THE NIGHTHAWK DINER,

09:40.881 --> 09:43.281
AND NOW I'M PLAYING
A WAITRESS HERE.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.216
-IT'S YOUR REAL LIFE.
-IT CAN'T BE.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.788
WELL, I'M KINDA
LIKING THIS MOVIE.

09:52.759 --> 09:56.928
COME ON! IT'S A CHANCE TO GO
BACK AND SEE WHAT TIME
HAS TAUGHT US.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.263
COME ON, IT'S OUR HISTORY!

09:58.265 --> 09:59.297
YOU AND ME,

09:59.299 --> 10:00.332
FEENY,

10:00.334 --> 10:01.900
SHAWN AND ANGELA.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.070
GIVE ME A SHOVEL.
NO REASON.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.805
GIVE ME A SHOVEL
AND YOUR HEAD.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.208
WHO'S ANGELA?

10:12.245 --> 10:15.447
OH, YOU KNOW.
SOMEONE WHO USED
TO BE IN MY LIFE.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.416
AH, YES. WELL, WE ALL
HAVE ONE OF THOSE, DON'T WE?

10:18.418 --> 10:20.702
DO YOU MISS HER?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.987
I KNOW I'D MISS RILEY AND MAYA
IF I DIDN'T SEE THEM FOR
A LONG TIME.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.023
DO YOU THINK YOUR OLD FEELINGS
WILL GET ALL STIRRED UP
FOR HER?

10:25.025 --> 10:28.059
AND YOU'LL MISS HER?
AND YOU'LL GO BACK AND LIVE
WHEREVER SHE IS?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.830
DO YOU NEVER MISS?

10:33.500 --> 10:37.202
YEAH, MR. HUNTER,
YOU GONNA GET SOME FEELINGS
ALL STIRRED UP?

10:39.106 --> 10:41.973
MAYA, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I THINK WE SHOULD BE
GOING WITH THEM.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.308
DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD GO?

10:45.212 --> 10:46.344
WE'RE GOING WITH YOU.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.113
ALL RIGHT.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.881
KATY, DO YOU MIND IF WE
TAKE THIS ONE OFF YOUR HANDS
FOR THE WEEKEND?

10:49.883 --> 10:50.982
HAVE FUN, BABY GIRL.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.984
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
GRAB A SHOVEL.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.819
WE'RE DIGGING UP THE PAST!

10:54.821 --> 10:55.920
YAY.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.399
COME ON, TOPANGA!
PUT SOME BACK INTO IT,
WILL YOU?

11:07.401 --> 11:09.367
(whispering)
I HAVE BLISTERS!

11:09.369 --> 11:11.936
AND, IT'S NOT EXACTLY LIKE
I'M WEARING MY SHOVELING SHOES.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.238
WHAT ABOUT YOU GUYS?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.006
WE'RE ON A MANDATORY BREAK.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.875
HEY, I THOUGHT WE WERE
ONLY DOING EVERY OTHER HOLE.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.111
YOU SAID YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHERE THIS THING WAS BURIED.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.480
WELL, IT'S IN THIS
GENERAL VICINITY, YES.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.249
HOW IS THIS FUN?

11:24.250 --> 11:26.017
YOU SAID THIS WAS GONNA BE FUN.
HOW CAN ANYBODY MAKE THIS FUN?

11:26.953 --> 11:31.089
I MADE ONE FOR MAYA'S HEAD.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.674
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE DIGGING.

11:32.675 --> 11:34.258
OH, BUT I WAS DIGGING
FOR AN HOUR,

11:34.261 --> 11:36.928
AND ALL I FOUND
WAS THIS OLD METAL BOX.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.499
CORY...

11:41.501 --> 11:43.301
-WHAT?
-I'M CONCERNED.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.102
WHAT'S THERE TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT, SHAWNIE?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.939
THAT.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.978
(gasping)

11:55.582 --> 11:56.648
MR. MATTHEWS.

11:57.584 --> 11:58.883
MR. HUNTER.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.252
WE MEET AGAIN.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.888
DETENTION?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.624
BIG BOY DETENTION.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.961
I WON'T DO WELL
IN BIG BOY DETENTION.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.468
FEENY!

12:16.470 --> 12:19.437
FEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEENAY!

12:20.674 --> 12:26.945
-WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT...
-HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY...

12:26.947 --> 12:34.085
(hissing like cats)

12:36.189 --> 12:37.255
OKAY, LET'S GO.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.358
MRS. MATTHEWS.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.993
HOW YOU DOING?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.996
PUT BACK MY FLOWERS.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.197
EXCEPT FOR THOSE.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.966
I'LL ATTEND TO THOSE MYSELF.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.103
EXCUSE ME.

12:56.643 --> 13:00.245
IS HE A GOOD FATHER,
YOU POOR, POOR, LITTLE GIRL?

13:02.349 --> 13:03.581
I'M VERY LUCKY.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.616
HMM.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.118
IS HE A GOOD TEACHER?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.154
I THINK HE'S THE BEST
THERE IS.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.555
-OH.
-BUT, HE SAYS YOU ARE.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.056
OH.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.726
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE DIGGING FOR?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.096
IT'S OUR TIME CAPSULE, REMEMBER?

13:18.098 --> 13:20.098
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.334
WE WANNA SEE
HOW TIME TREATED US.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.557
IF WE TURNED OUT
LIKE WE HOPED WE WOULD.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.741
GOT ANY ADVICE FOR US
WHILE WE'RE ALL OUT HERE
TOGETHER, MR. FEENY?

13:29.743 --> 13:31.442
WELL, YES.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.147
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
AND YOU'RE STILL TOGETHER.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.418
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED
TO KNOW?

13:48.562 --> 13:50.228
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO FIRST.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.096
NOW, NO ONE KNOWS
WHAT ANYONE ELSE BURIED, RIGHT?

13:52.098 --> 13:53.665
-YEAH, THAT WAS THE DEAL.
-DON'T OPEN IT.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.036
YEAH, WOULDN'T YOU RATHER
BELIEVE YOUR LIVES ARE PERFECT?

13:58.038 --> 14:00.004
YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT, GIRLS,
YOU DO.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.539
BUT, HERE'S ANOTHER POINT.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.740
HAVE YOU EVEN MET ME?

14:07.314 --> 14:08.413
THERE IT IS.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.085
IT'S THE JEAN JACKET.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.021
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
WE SAID "I LOVE YOU."

14:19.593 --> 14:20.658
AND IT STILL FITS.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.262
TIME HAS BEEN GOOD
TO YOU, TOPANGA.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.030
TIME HAS BEEN GOOD
TO US ALL.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.300
AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO
THE TIME CAPSULE!

14:32.405 --> 14:33.605
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

14:33.607 --> 14:36.040
OKAY, DON'T OVERREACT.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.609
WHY WOULD I OVERREACT?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.177
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE GOING
TO MISINTERPRET THIS.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.182
LET'S SEE.

14:45.652 --> 14:50.288
"DEAR CORY, IF YOU WOULD LET
IT HAPPEN, I THINK YOU AND I
COULD HAVE A FUTURE."

14:50.290 --> 14:52.123
TOPANGA, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS? THIS IS GREAT.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.625
IT'S NOT FROM HER.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.129
AAH!

14:59.099 --> 15:00.164
IT'S FROM LAUREN.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.753
WHO'S LAUREN?

15:04.754 --> 15:07.105
WELL, BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED,
YOUR FATHER MET A GIRL
AT A SKI LODGE,

15:07.107 --> 15:08.773
AND SHE REALLY LIKED HIM.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.408
MATTHEWS, YOU DOG!

15:12.112 --> 15:14.579
IS THIS WHY WE NEVER
GO SKIING?

15:16.316 --> 15:19.183
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS,
TOPANGA? I...

15:19.185 --> 15:20.852
I BURIED A SYMBOL
OF OUR LOVE.

15:20.854 --> 15:24.389
CORY, I WAS THREATENED BY THIS
BECAUSE I WAS YOUNG.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.824
THE JEAN JACKET WAS THE FIRST
TIME WE SAID "I LOVE YOU."

15:26.826 --> 15:30.161
BUT, I ALMOST LET THIS LITTLE
PIECE OF PAPER HURT US

15:30.163 --> 15:33.131
BECAUSE I WAS YOUNG.

15:33.132 --> 15:36.100
YOU ALWAYS KNEW,
BUT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT
OUR LOVE WILL LAST FOREVER.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.769
AND THAT NOTHING COULD HURT IT.

15:37.771 --> 15:41.239
I BURIED THIS BECAUSE
I HOPED THAT WHEN WE OPENED IT,

15:41.241 --> 15:45.376
I WOULD BE SITTING NEXT TO YOU ,
AND THAT I COULD GO LIKE THIS.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.518
HERE GOES.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.453
ALL RIGHT, HERE GOES.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.324
AH...

15:59.326 --> 16:01.259
<i>SHAKESPEARE'S   SONNETS.</i>

16:02.662 --> 16:04.462
VIVALDI'S <i> FOUR SEASONS.</i>

16:06.299 --> 16:07.732
A VAN DAMME MOVIE TICKET.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.335
AND LIP GLOSS.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.837
KIWI MANGO.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.240
AH, ME AND ANGELA.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.643
WE WERE GONNA BE
CORY AND TOPANGA.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.779
I GUESS THERE CAN ONLY
BE ONE CORY AND TOPANGA.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.281
BUT, STILL...

16:24.217 --> 16:25.350
ME AND ANGELA.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.152
I WONDER WHAT
SHE'S UP TO NOWADAYS?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.189
BYE, SHAWN.

16:40.867 --> 16:44.168
SEE, LIFE WORKS OUT BETTER
IF YOU DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.371
SHAWN WILL GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND,

16:46.373 --> 16:48.373
PLUTO IS NOT
A PLANET ANYMORE,

16:48.375 --> 16:51.175
AND MY MOM AND ME
ARE JUST MY MOM AND ME.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.928
PLUTO IS A PLANET.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.679
SORRY, RILEY, BUT YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE WHO SAYS IT IS.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.216
YOU HEARD THEM TELL
THE STORY, MAYA.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.952
THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN MY FATHER WAS THE ONLY ONE

17:00.954 --> 17:03.354
WHO KNEW HE AND MY MOTHER
WOULD ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.723
EVEN WHEN EVERYONE ELSE
SAID THAT THEY WOULDN'T.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.225
HE KNEW.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.427
AND SO DO I.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.296
AND SO DOES YOUR MOTHER.
BECAUSE SHE'S RIGHT.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.199
DREAM DREAMS, MAYA.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.202
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN LIFE.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.606
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
YOU CAN STILL HAVE HOPE FOR ME?

17:21.608 --> 17:23.207
HEY...

17:23.209 --> 17:26.377
I HAVE HOPE FOR SOMETHING
FOUR BILLION MILES AWAY.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.914
YOU HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN RIGHT HERE.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.358
I KNOW THAT ANGELA AND I
USED TO JUST BE ABLE
TO SIT TOGETHER.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.492
WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO TALK.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.394
-YOU DIDN'T TALK?
-NO.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.363
WE'D JUST BE WITH EACH OTHER.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.798
AM I EVER GONNA
FIND THAT AGAIN?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.499
MAYBE YOU'LL FIND
SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

17:48.501 --> 17:49.801
YEAH, IS DIFFERENT BETTER?

17:49.803 --> 17:51.903
MAYBE, IF YOU GIVE IT
A CHANCE.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.873
SHAWN, WHY DIDN'T YOU
END UP WITH ANGELA?

17:55.875 --> 17:58.276
SHE ENDED IT
AND WALKED OUT ON ME.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.545
TIME HAS TAUGHT ME
THAT'S NOT GOOD
FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.916
I PUT THIS STUFF
IN THE TIME CAPSULE BECAUSE
I THOUGHT WHEN WE OPENED IT

18:04.918 --> 18:07.251
THERE MIGHT BE
SOMEONE THERE FOR ME TO LOVE.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.420
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE THAT.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.891
DON'T BE SUCH A JERK!

18:18.031 --> 18:19.730
WOMEN USED TO LIKE ME, RIGHT?

18:22.469 --> 18:23.501
(knocking)

18:23.503 --> 18:24.869
COME IN, UNCLE SHAWN.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.138
HOW'D YOU KNOW
IT WAS ME?

18:27.139 --> 18:28.472
MY FAMILY DOESN'T KNOCK.
THEY'RE PIGS.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.315
OKAY.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.952
WHAT?

18:40.954 --> 18:43.454
YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY
PLUTO ISN'T A PLANET ANYMORE?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.323
YEAH. YEAH, I HEARD
ABOUT THAT.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.891
DOESN'T THAT KILL YOU?

18:46.893 --> 18:48.292
NO.

18:50.497 --> 18:51.863
PLUTO IS STILL
OUT THERE FOR ME.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.631
I DON'T CARE.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.336
YOU WEREN'T AFRAID
TO LOVE SOMEBODY ONCE.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.973
YEAH, WELL, I...
I'M DONE WITH THAT.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.375
I DON'T HAVE THAT,
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.577
YOU ARE. THERE'S SOMEONE
OUT THERE FOR YOU.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.347
SO, YOU'RE SAYING
PLUTO IS ANGELA?

19:13.620 --> 19:16.854
NO, I'M SAYING THAT PLUTO
IS BELIEVING IN SOMETHING
OUT THERE

19:16.856 --> 19:19.023
NO MATTER WHAT
ANYBODY SAYS.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.091
ESPECIALLY YOU.

19:20.093 --> 19:22.360
BECAUSE THERE IS.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.329
HOW ARE YOU NOT GETTING
THIS YET, BUDDY?

19:34.741 --> 19:35.940
YOU BELIEVE IN ME?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.441
I DO.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.477
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE FOR YOU.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.046
CAN YOU JUST BE
OUT THERE FOR ME?

19:42.048 --> 19:43.681
YES.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.484
I CAN DO THAT.
I WANT TO DO THAT.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.586
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?

19:49.556 --> 19:51.489
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU CALL IT.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.058
I JUST WANNA KNOW
THAT YOU'RE THERE.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.764
OKAY.

20:05.605 --> 20:06.804
I'M THERE.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.946
OKAY, I'LL GO FIRST.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.814
YOU PUTTING IN
YOUR SHEEP NICKEL, BILLY BOB?

20:16.816 --> 20:19.150
NO, I CHANGED MY MIND
ABOUT THAT.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.819
I'M NOT PUTTING IN A REMINDER
OF WHEN I GAVE UP ON A DREAM.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.458
YOUR TRANSFER SLIP.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.426
I'D RATHER BE REMINDED
OF WHEN SOMETHING GOOD STARTED.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.096
ME NEXT.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.631
YOUR SCIENCE FAIR TROPHY?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.433
WASN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH
FOR THIS.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.471
YOUR FAVORITE ORANGE
TURTLENECK.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.873
IT WAS THE ONE I TOOK OFF
WHEN I FELT LIKE I WAS NOTHING.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.775
BUT, YOU GUYS WOULDN'T
LET ME BE NOTHING.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.511
AND SINCE IT'S US THAT'S
GONNA BE TOGETHER WHEN
WE OPEN THIS,

20:47.513 --> 20:49.013
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE SOMETHING THAT I AM.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.483
RILEY, PLUTO?

20:52.485 --> 20:54.986
YEAH. STILL PLUTO.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.689
WHENEVER WE OPEN THIS,

20:58.691 --> 21:01.525
I HOPE I HAVEN'T STOPPED
BELIEVING IN THINGS.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.032
OKAY, I'LL PLAY.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.001
BUT, YOU GUYS
HAVE TO LEAVE.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.837
YOUR PARENTS AND SHAWN
DIDN'T TELL EACH OTHER
WHAT THEY WERE PUTTING IN,

21:12.839 --> 21:14.705
AND THAT'S THE WAY
I WANT TO DO IT.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.474
I'M HOPING WE'LL
ALL BE SURPRISED.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.301
HEY.

21:27.302 --> 21:29.452
WHATEVER IT IS,
I HOPE IT WORKS OUT
THE WAY YOU WANT IT.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.122
ME TOO.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.173
HOPE IS FOR SUCKERS.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.959
HI, SHAWN.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.895
UM, WE'RE CLOSING UP,

22:10.897 --> 22:12.596
BUT I COULD GET YOU
SOMETHING FOR THE ROAD?

22:12.598 --> 22:14.532
UH, YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.567
ACTUALLY, NO.

22:17.637 --> 22:18.936
FEEL LIKE SITTING DOWN
FOR A SECOND?

22:18.938 --> 22:22.206
YEAH. NO, I DO. YEAH.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.808
WHEW.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.279
DID YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING?

22:28.281 --> 22:29.680
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.616
WE CAN JUST... SIT HERE.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.587
WILL THAT BE OKAY?

22:36.589 --> 22:38.689
(laughs)

22:44.764 --> 22:48.099
THAT WAS GREAT.
NOW TALK?

22:48.101 --> 22:49.633
-YEAH, WOULD THAT BE BETTER?
-MM-HMM.

22:49.635 --> 22:52.603
IT'S CERTAINLY HARDER,
BUT I FOUND IT CAN BE, YEAH.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.756
LIP GLOSS.

22:55.757 --> 22:57.640
YEAH, I PUT THIS ON
WHEN I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.644
WHAT FLAVOR IS THAT?

23:01.647 --> 23:03.114
CINNAMON SPICE.

23:03.116 --> 23:06.150
IS THAT BETTER THAN
KIWI MANGO?

23:06.152 --> 23:07.685
IT'S DIFFERENT.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.671
IS DIFFERENT BETTER?

23:10.672 --> 23:12.622
WELL, I GUESS THAT DEPENDS
ON THE LIFE YOU'RE HAVING.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.259
FOR ME, YEAH, I'D
TAKE DIFFERENT.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.595
I'M READY FOR DIFFERENT.

23:17.597 --> 23:18.863
HOW ABOUT YOU?

23:21.300 --> 23:23.634
YOU HEAR THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
MAKING PLUTO A PLANET AGAIN?

23:24.937 --> 23:26.137
YEAH.

23:28.574 --> 23:29.673
HOW ABOUT THAT?
