00:30.296 --> 00:32.890
It's time now.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.170
You have to look beautiful
for your funeral,

00:38.204 --> 00:40.536
as if you were still alive,

00:40.573 --> 00:43.337
just sleeping.

00:43.376 --> 00:47.312
This is how they're all
going to remember you.

02:26.679 --> 02:28.613
What's wrong?

02:29.649 --> 02:31.617
Nothing.

02:40.527 --> 02:43.121
You used to enjoy it.

02:48.468 --> 02:51.335
Baby, I'm sorry.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.802
Fuck. Fuck!

03:00.180 --> 03:02.978
Anna, what's wrong?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.643
It just- it feels like...

03:05.685 --> 03:08.017
it feels like
you're somewhere else.

03:10.823 --> 03:13.087
Is it about us?
Is that what it is?

03:13.126 --> 03:16.357
It's not about us.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.956
What is it
do you think, huh?

03:20.166 --> 03:22.100
I don't know.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.504
Listen,

03:28.541 --> 03:30.668
I just want us
to be happy again.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.537
Are you happy?

03:37.417 --> 03:39.214
I'm happy.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.447
Anna, I love you so much.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.045
Hey, Jack.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.144
Didn't you hear me, jackoff?

04:14.187 --> 04:18.089
You deaf, jackoff?
Can't fucking speak either?

04:18.124 --> 04:19.488
- Say something!
- Hey.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.653
What's going on here?

04:22.695 --> 04:25.129
- Nothing, Ms. Taylor.
- Nothing?

04:25.164 --> 04:27.598
It doesn't look like nothing.

04:27.634 --> 04:30.569
You boys get back to class.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.833
Now!
Back to class.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.370
Jack, you okay?

04:43.416 --> 04:46.146
- I think it's dead.
- Which one?

04:48.321 --> 04:50.915
That guy? No.

04:50.957 --> 04:54.256
Poor thing.
He's just scared.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.387
See?

05:15.281 --> 05:17.875
Jordan, are you guys
picking up George Shore?

05:17.917 --> 05:19.817
George is...

06:34.394 --> 06:36.191
Hello?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.323
Is somebody there?

06:44.370 --> 06:47.464
- Jack?
- Did I scare you, Mr. Taylor?

06:47.507 --> 06:50.067
No, um...

06:50.109 --> 06:52.202
it's locked.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.121
Shouldn't you be home?

07:02.155 --> 07:04.487
My mom's picking me up.

07:04.524 --> 07:07.220
Okay, well, I've gotta run.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.423
- Where are you going?
- To a funeral.

07:10.463 --> 07:13.125
- My old piano teacher.
- Can I come?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.134
No, Jack.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.604
A funeral's a very-
a very private affair.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.232
I've never been
to a funeral before.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.606
It wouldn't be appropriate.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.668
Anyway,
wouldn't your mother worry?

07:25.711 --> 07:28.680
- Not really.
- I'm sure she would.

07:30.082 --> 07:31.879
Have a wonderful day, okay?

07:31.918 --> 07:33.510
I'll see you in class tomorrow.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.180
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

08:26.138 --> 08:30.006
We have entrusted our brother
James Hutton to God's mercy

08:30.042 --> 08:33.842
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection...

08:58.237 --> 09:01.434
White roses
they were his favorite.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.068
How did you know?

09:04.110 --> 09:06.101
They just seemed
appropriate somehow.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.744
Mrs. Hutton, I'm so sorry.

09:14.787 --> 09:17.551
Thank you, Anna.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.319
You look tired, dear.

09:19.358 --> 09:22.657
No no, I'm fine.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.686
Everything's fine.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.258
- I'm so sorry.
- You scared the life out of me.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.124
I'm sorry.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.097
Oh! Your hair.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.498
- Do you not like it?
- No, I didn't say that.

11:08.534 --> 11:10.092
It's just very...

11:10.136 --> 11:12.036
it's very red.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.561
Not really you, is it?

11:15.107 --> 11:17.132
- Are you ready to order?
- Yes.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.939
We'll have the duck, please.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.912
- Paul.
- You always have the duck here.

11:20.946 --> 11:23.278
I don't always have the duck.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.916
- I'll have the duck.
- Yes, ma'am.

11:28.954 --> 11:31.218
The duck's very good.

11:31.257 --> 11:34.158
Listen, let's

11:34.193 --> 11:36.684
come here.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.492
Let's try not to fight
tonight, okay?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.624
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.062
What are we drinking?

11:44.103 --> 11:46.503
Oh yes, all right.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.167
It's good.

11:49.208 --> 11:53.144
And it has a very
expensive-looking label.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.874
What's the special occasion?

11:54.914 --> 11:57.382
There's something I really
need to talk to you about.

11:57.416 --> 12:00.544
About us. I've been offered
a transfer to head office

12:00.586 --> 12:03.054
in Chicago.
It's gonna mean a lot more work,

12:03.089 --> 12:06.149
of course a lot of responsibility
and a lot of changes,

12:06.192 --> 12:09.889
but it's an incredible opportunity
and I'd be crazy to turn it down.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.523
So I'm thinking maybe

12:12.565 --> 12:14.123
it's time for us to

12:14.166 --> 12:16.225
- You're leaving me.
- What?

12:16.268 --> 12:19.260
You could have told me this morning.
You didn't have to buy me off

12:19.305 --> 12:21.603
- with this expensive dinner.
- Anna, wait.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.232
- No.
- You told me everything

12:23.275 --> 12:25.573
- was gonna be okay.
- Don't be ridiculous.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.478
- Anna, you've got it all wrong.
- I'm not being ridiculous.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.176
Jesus Christ, can we get through
one meal without arguing?

12:31.217 --> 12:32.844
- No. No.
- Please, just one meal!

12:32.885 --> 12:35.080
Apparently we can't.
Apparently I'm not capable of that.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.884
Maybe you aren't.
I'm beginning to wonder.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.913
- Fuck you.
- Please, everyone's watching.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.722
- Don't do this.
- Fuck you!

12:41.761 --> 12:44.355
You're- you're crazy.
You're just like your goddamn mother.

12:44.396 --> 12:47.229
I am nothing like my mother.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.427
You know,
I'm not running after you, Anna.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.197
Good!

12:52.204 --> 12:54.001
Shit.

12:58.344 --> 13:00.107
- Fuck.

13:02.214 --> 13:03.875
Anna, Anna!

13:03.916 --> 13:05.440
Anna, come on.
Please open the door.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.714
- I don't want to hear it.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.584
I want you to come.
I want you to come to-

13:09.622 --> 13:12.614
Don't do this.
Anna! Hey hey hey.

13:12.658 --> 13:15.650
Anna, I want you to come to-
I want you to come to Chicago.

13:15.694 --> 13:18.458
Anna, Anna- God damn it!

13:18.497 --> 13:20.488
Please don't go.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.933
Shit.

13:24.036 --> 13:26.698
Oh, Anna.

13:43.088 --> 13:45.249
Fucking asshole.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.026
* Are we having *

13:51.063 --> 13:54.294
* Are we having fun? *

13:54.333 --> 13:56.665
* Are we
having fun? *

13:59.205 --> 14:01.264
* Fun *

14:01.307 --> 14:03.775
* Are we having fun? *

14:04.777 --> 14:06.768
* Are we
having fun? *

14:07.780 --> 14:09.771
- Shit!

16:22.815 --> 16:25.841
Where am l?

16:28.854 --> 16:32.449
You're in a funeral home.
You're dead.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.954
You were in a car accident.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.328
Shit.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.633
You hit a truck loaded
with metal pipes.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.471
I'm not dead.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.672
You were pronounced dead
eight hours ago.

16:54.713 --> 16:58.149
Your blood no longer circulates
through your body.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.277
Your brain cells are slowly dying.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.550
Your body's already decomposing.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.817
I'm not dead.

17:18.737 --> 17:21.262
This is your death certificate.

17:21.306 --> 17:23.569
Cause of death,
massive internal trauma.

17:23.608 --> 17:26.339
Time of death: 8:23 p.m.

17:26.377 --> 17:29.745
You were dead on arrival.
The attendant physician signed here

17:29.782 --> 17:32.114
at 9:45 last night.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.353
I'm sorry.

17:39.691 --> 17:43.354
What's happening?
Why can't I move?

17:48.467 --> 17:51.334
Don't touch me.
Why are you touching me?

17:51.370 --> 17:54.134
I'm preparing your body.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.698
You have to look beautiful
for your funeral.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.142
But I'm not dead.

17:59.178 --> 18:00.975
You all say the same thing.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.382
Maybe you should rest now.

18:16.795 --> 18:18.422
Oh my God.

18:18.464 --> 18:21.661
I can't be dead.
I can't be dead.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.066
This must be a nightmare.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.230
Oh, God, wake up.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.535
Wake up.

18:29.541 --> 18:32.408
Wake up. Wake up!

18:34.113 --> 18:36.081
Anna.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.257
Baby, you've got it wrong.
I want you to come to Chicago.

19:20.292 --> 19:21.987
I want you to come.

19:23.195 --> 19:25.060
Okay, we've gotta talk.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.429
I'm gonna come by your place
before I go to the office

19:27.466 --> 19:29.434
and everything's going to be fine.

19:30.869 --> 19:34.999
I promise.
Call me when you get this.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.106
I love you so much.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.973
Okay, I'll see you soon.

19:54.393 --> 19:57.191
- The shell grows
- Hi, I'm...

19:57.229 --> 19:58.696
Iooking for Anna Taylor.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.925
I'm sorry,
you can't just come in here.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.491
I'm Anna's fiance
Paul Coleman.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.969
This is her room, right?

20:06.004 --> 20:07.631
She didn't come in today.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.005
Did she call in sick?

20:10.042 --> 20:11.942
She didn't call in at all.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.879
Okay, yeah, thanks.
Sorry. Thank you.

20:22.688 --> 20:25.282
Funeral director:
She's a schoolteacher.

20:25.324 --> 20:28.691
I know. It's always so difficult
when they're so young.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.794
That's right, you knew her.
She was at your funeral.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.296
She's in good hands now.

21:02.327 --> 21:05.626
- Oh, hi, Diane.

21:05.664 --> 21:08.861
- Is Anna home?
- I think you'd better come in.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.027
What's wrong?

21:11.069 --> 21:13.663
What happened?
Where is Anna?

21:15.374 --> 21:18.502
Anna was in
a car accident last night.

21:18.543 --> 21:20.238
My daughter's dead.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.145
That's what's happened.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.475
Car accident?

21:27.519 --> 21:30.886
When? What-
what are you talking about?

21:30.922 --> 21:32.947
I don't know.

21:32.991 --> 21:35.687
They said it happened
just before 8:30.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.530
We were at-

21:39.564 --> 21:41.361
no, we were at a restaurant.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.766
You shouldn't have let her
drive in that weather.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.828
She can't be dead.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.634
There must be some mistake.

21:52.944 --> 21:55.037
There's no mistake.

21:55.080 --> 21:59.449
And flowers- how appropriate.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.454
What?

22:07.125 --> 22:09.286
Why wouldn't you call me?

22:09.328 --> 22:12.320
You took her away from me.

22:12.364 --> 22:15.856
I don't want you
anywhere near her.

22:31.950 --> 22:34.145
Please don't hurt me.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.450
How could I hurt you?
You're already dead.

22:36.488 --> 22:38.422
I can't be dead.

22:38.457 --> 22:40.516
Then why are you here?

22:43.729 --> 22:46.357
Just let me go.

22:46.398 --> 22:50.528
Please please.
I won't tell anyone. I promise.

22:50.569 --> 22:53.834
You're still in denial.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.669
You have to trust me.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.506
I'm only here to help you.

23:11.857 --> 23:14.018
What's happening?

23:16.962 --> 23:19.829
Why can't I feel anything?

23:38.450 --> 23:41.044
Why are you keeping me here?

23:50.562 --> 23:52.655
- What are you doing?
- Shh shh shh.

23:52.697 --> 23:55.165
Don't be scared.
This will relax your muscles.

23:57.302 --> 23:59.566
Stop the rigor mortis setting in.

24:01.206 --> 24:03.106
So I can work on your body.

24:07.579 --> 24:09.513
Your mother's early.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.785
I'm so very sorry, Mrs. Taylor.

24:17.823 --> 24:20.917
It's always so tragic
when one loses a child.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.621
If you'd care to come to my office,
we can make arrangements.

24:23.662 --> 24:26.358
- I want to see her.
- But she hasn't been prepared.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.025
I don't care.
I want to see her.

24:28.066 --> 24:29.966
Of course. This way.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.589
- Oh, forgive me.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.387
As I said,

24:54.426 --> 24:57.122
I've only just started
preparing her.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.325
So sorry.

25:00.365 --> 25:01.832
What's the point

25:01.867 --> 25:04.995
of preserving the body
if the soul has already left?

25:05.036 --> 25:08.005
No, the soul is still here.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.409
It's we who suffer.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.503
We who are left behind.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.506
Who's going to take care
of me now?

25:18.550 --> 25:20.677
Did you think about that?

25:25.323 --> 25:28.258
I'll confirm the date
with Father Graham this afternoon:

25:28.293 --> 25:29.817
Friday, as you requested.

25:31.062 --> 25:33.189
Just do what you think is best.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.425
It's just details.

25:43.575 --> 25:45.975
Oh, there is one thing.

25:46.011 --> 25:48.275
- Yes?
- Her hair.

25:48.313 --> 25:50.304
She was a brunette.

25:50.348 --> 25:52.339
I'd like it back to that color.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.784
Of course.

26:21.613 --> 26:25.105
Mom, you were supposed to pick
me up from school yesterday.

26:27.552 --> 26:29.349
I waited.

26:29.387 --> 26:31.685
I'll take a look at the clock,
see how many seconds you have

26:31.723 --> 26:33.554
to find the two Easter eggs.
You have 30 seconds.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.822
You understand the problem?
And of course the usual catch

26:35.860 --> 26:37.794
is on "Beat the Clock" is
you can't use your hands.

26:37.829 --> 26:39.319
You have to go after these
with your teeth.

27:45.263 --> 27:47.026
I must be in shock.

27:47.065 --> 27:49.693
I'm just in shock.
It's okay.

28:24.736 --> 28:27.136
Father Graham,
thanks for calling back.

28:27.172 --> 28:30.801
Yes, I'd like to confirm
the burial service for Friday.

28:30.842 --> 28:35.438
The deceased is Anna Taylor.
T-A-Y-L-O-R.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.108
Yes, she's downstairs.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.387
Hello? Hello!

28:46.925 --> 28:48.790
Let me out!

28:55.033 --> 28:56.898
Let me out!

29:21.526 --> 29:23.687
May I help you?

29:23.728 --> 29:25.992
- Eliot Deacon?
- Yes.

29:26.030 --> 29:27.998
Paul Coleman.

29:28.032 --> 29:31.331
Of course, the lawyer.

29:33.404 --> 29:34.666
It's a small town.

29:34.706 --> 29:37.334
In my line of work you get
to know everyone eventually.

29:38.476 --> 29:40.535
I'm Anna Taylor's fiance.

29:40.578 --> 29:44.537
That's strange. She wasn't
wearing an engagement ring.

29:45.817 --> 29:48.581
Well, not quite fiance.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.611
Mr. Coleman,
I am so sorry for your loss.

29:50.655 --> 29:52.520
- I'd like to see her.
- I'm afraid

29:52.557 --> 29:54.388
the viewing isn't
until Thursday evening.

29:54.425 --> 29:56.290
I need to see her right now,
please, if that's possible.

29:56.327 --> 29:58.921
I'm sorry it's not possible.
You're not family.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.363
- Please give me five minutes.
- I do understand, Mr. Cole

30:01.399 --> 30:03.765
You don't understand!
You don't understand.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.963
- Paul?

30:07.939 --> 30:10.464
- Paul, Paul!
- It's my fault.

30:10.508 --> 30:12.567
I'm down here.

30:12.610 --> 30:15.579
Please,
please let me just see her.

30:15.613 --> 30:18.582
There really is nothing I can do.
I'm so sorry.

30:18.616 --> 30:21.380
Let me out!

30:25.824 --> 30:27.621
Paul!

30:53.651 --> 30:55.983
Who was that?

30:57.422 --> 30:59.322
No one.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.459
No one?

31:07.932 --> 31:10.628
- It was Paul.
- I know.

31:10.668 --> 31:13.569
I heard you talking to him.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.969
Why wouldn't you
let him see me?

31:20.378 --> 31:23.541
Did you love him?

31:23.581 --> 31:26.106
That's none of your business.

31:26.150 --> 31:29.517
You weren't gonna tell me
he was here, were you?

31:29.554 --> 31:31.784
No.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.757
- Why?
- Because it would only hurt you.

31:34.792 --> 31:37.761
You have to let go of the living
just as they have to let go of you.

31:37.795 --> 31:39.956
I don't believe you.

31:39.998 --> 31:42.523
Why are you doing this to me?

31:42.567 --> 31:45.195
You're all the same.
You all blame me for your death

31:45.236 --> 31:47.227
- as if it were my fault.
- No,

31:47.272 --> 31:49.672
you drugged me so my mother

31:49.707 --> 31:52.471
Others, they just see you
as a dead body on the slab.

31:52.510 --> 31:55.479
Only I can see you as you really are.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.349
You're a lunatic.

31:59.384 --> 32:02.251
You're crazy.

32:02.287 --> 32:05.654
You're completely crazy.

32:07.525 --> 32:10.494
I don't have time for this.
I'm a busy man.

32:13.631 --> 32:16.259
Oh, I nearly forgot.
How tall are you?

32:16.301 --> 32:18.599
Why?

32:18.636 --> 32:21.537
I need to know your height
for your coffin.

32:31.749 --> 32:33.376
Let's say 5'3" then.

32:34.719 --> 32:37.847
Wait. No.

32:53.604 --> 32:56.232
Mr. Coleman, I heard
about your girlfriend.

32:56.274 --> 32:58.299
I'm sorry.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.607
Is Tom in?

33:00.645 --> 33:02.579
The captain just stepped out.
He won't be long.

33:02.613 --> 33:04.240
You can wait in his office
if you want.

33:04.282 --> 33:07.649
Um, no, thanks.
I'll just grab a drink.

33:19.864 --> 33:22.355
Piece of shit.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.708
Are you okay?

35:20.751 --> 35:23.720
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

35:23.754 --> 35:26.279
I'm fine.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.930
I just found out.

35:35.967 --> 35:39.403
I'm so sorry, man. Look,
if there's anything you need at all

35:39.437 --> 35:42.167
- I need to see Anna.
- What do you mean?

35:42.206 --> 35:45.937
The funeral director said I couldn't
see her because I wasn't family.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.605
Please talk to him, Tom.
You know, pull some strings

35:48.646 --> 35:50.773
or show him your badge
or something.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.373
I can't do that, Paul.

35:55.486 --> 35:57.317
I fucked up, man.

36:01.859 --> 36:04.157
Are you sure you're okay?

36:04.195 --> 36:06.060
Huh? Yeah.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.395
I always fuck everything up.

37:34.385 --> 37:37.047
Oh God.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.648
I don't want to die.

38:21.098 --> 38:23.123
Who was she?

38:23.167 --> 38:25.499
Mrs. Whitehall.

38:41.218 --> 38:43.550
You shouldn't be afraid of her.

38:43.587 --> 38:45.646
The dead can't harm the dead.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.317
But I'm not dead!

38:52.330 --> 38:54.093
Stay where you are.

38:54.131 --> 38:55.758
Give me the scissors.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.829
I only want to help you.

38:58.869 --> 39:02.430
I'll kill you.
I swear to God I will kill you.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.908
Go ahead.

39:21.392 --> 39:23.724
Go on.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.630
What are you waiting for?

39:33.170 --> 39:35.536
Look,

39:35.573 --> 39:38.337
I'm breathing.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.709
I'm breathing.
Maybe I was in some kind of coma

39:41.746 --> 39:45.079
- and the doctors made a mistake
- You died, Anna.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.981
Everyone dies.

39:47.017 --> 39:50.111
How can I be dead
if I'm talking to you?

39:50.154 --> 39:51.917
You're talking

39:51.956 --> 39:54.789
not because you're alive,

39:54.825 --> 39:57.953
but because I have a gift.

39:59.363 --> 40:02.332
I can talk to those
between life and death.

40:02.366 --> 40:04.357
Why?

40:05.403 --> 40:08.839
To help them
make the transition.

40:08.873 --> 40:12.001
So am I a ghost?
Is that why I'm here?

40:12.042 --> 40:15.068
You're here so I can bury you.
Come.

40:15.112 --> 40:17.080
No, please, I don't want

40:17.114 --> 40:19.582
You're a corpse, Anna.
Your opinion doesn't count anymore.

40:19.617 --> 40:23.383
But I'm breathing.
I must still be alive.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.116
Oh, you people!

40:25.156 --> 40:28.751
You think because you breathe,
piss, shit you're alive?

40:28.793 --> 40:32.388
You clutch onto life as if
your life was worth clutching onto.

40:33.831 --> 40:37.028
Was your life worth
clutching onto, Anna? Was it?

40:37.067 --> 40:40.298
Maybe you died a long time ago.

40:44.041 --> 40:47.499
I'm surprised you're
still arguing with me.

40:47.545 --> 40:49.843
You don't have much time left.

40:55.085 --> 40:57.110
Your funeral's in two days.

40:57.154 --> 41:00.920
Soon you're going to be enclosed
in a coffin and buried in the ground.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.188
No one can hear you then.

41:03.227 --> 41:05.593
No one can speak to you there.

41:54.979 --> 41:57.311
- Are you scared?

42:23.874 --> 42:27.002
You're not ready.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.374
You're not ready.

43:25.903 --> 43:29.236
...struggling,
you don't have much time left.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.366
There's nothing.
He's right.

43:31.408 --> 43:33.933
What have you done
with your life?

43:33.978 --> 43:37.345
Maybe you did die
a long time ago.

43:37.381 --> 43:40.578
Maybe you did
die a long time ago.

43:44.488 --> 43:47.946
- I'm disappointed with you.
- Who are you?

43:47.992 --> 43:50.620
I am you.

43:50.661 --> 43:53.425
Maybe you are better off dead.

44:37.007 --> 44:39.066
Paul!

44:43.447 --> 44:45.642
Can I help you?

44:45.683 --> 44:48.208
Then perhaps
you can help me.

44:48.252 --> 44:50.083
Could you throw these
away for me, please?

45:06.570 --> 45:09.505
There's no life left in them.
They belong in the garbage.

45:14.611 --> 45:16.670
Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?

45:16.714 --> 45:19.808
I thought this was
Ms. Taylor's funeral.

45:19.850 --> 45:22.045
Ah, Ms. Taylor, no.

45:22.086 --> 45:25.055
Her funeral is not until Friday.

45:25.089 --> 45:27.250
Where is she now?

45:27.291 --> 45:29.953
Um, she's downstairs.

45:29.993 --> 45:31.483
Why?

45:31.528 --> 45:33.962
Why? Because she's not ready.

45:35.599 --> 45:37.294
Is the flower for her?

45:37.334 --> 45:40.360
- She was my teacher.
- Aha.

45:40.404 --> 45:43.669
- And you are?
- Jack.

45:46.443 --> 45:48.809
Well, Jack, what did you think?

45:48.846 --> 45:51.679
- About what?
- About Mrs. Whitehall's funeral.

45:51.715 --> 45:53.876
You find it interesting?

45:53.917 --> 45:55.578
It was okay, I guess.

45:57.254 --> 45:59.916
I see.

45:59.957 --> 46:02.790
Are all funerals the same?

46:02.826 --> 46:05.260
No, Jack.

46:05.295 --> 46:07.092
They're never the same.

46:07.131 --> 46:09.326
Each one is special.

46:09.366 --> 46:12.802
The dead always speak to us
in different ways.

46:14.138 --> 46:16.163
What do you mean?

46:16.206 --> 46:19.869
It was a pleasure
talking to you, Jack.

46:47.337 --> 46:49.032
Why did you do this?

46:54.344 --> 46:56.642
Why did you do this?!

46:58.615 --> 47:01.106
Is this the afterlife?

47:04.221 --> 47:07.019
Because it feels more like hell.

47:17.701 --> 47:20.261
Paul.

47:29.746 --> 47:31.338
Paul...

47:57.274 --> 47:59.469
Anna?

48:05.182 --> 48:07.173
No.

48:09.519 --> 48:11.316
Anna.

48:13.090 --> 48:14.318
Anna.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.262
No!

49:10.614 --> 49:12.741
- What is that?
- It's your dress

49:12.783 --> 49:15.718
- for your funeral.
- My funeral dress?

49:15.752 --> 49:18.448
Your mother brought it
around this morning.

49:39.009 --> 49:41.944
I'm not ready to die.
Not yet.

49:45.482 --> 49:48.076
There's nothing
out there for you anymore.

49:53.457 --> 49:56.255
I'll be back soon.

50:43.540 --> 50:44.632
Oh, come on.

50:45.675 --> 50:47.870
Shit!

50:56.019 --> 50:58.317
- Fuck.

51:02.192 --> 51:04.683
One more key, come on.

51:10.567 --> 51:13.092
20 dollar, four cents.

51:13.136 --> 51:15.366
Thank you.

51:21.711 --> 51:23.576
Sir, your change.

54:07.911 --> 54:10.004
Oh.

54:23.893 --> 54:25.554
Please be there.

54:34.404 --> 54:35.928
Please be there.

54:39.909 --> 54:43.037
Please pick up.
Please pick up.

54:48.952 --> 54:50.783
Oh, come on,
answer the phone.

54:57.994 --> 55:00.758
Yeah?

55:00.797 --> 55:03.527
I'm here. It's me.
Paul, I need you.

55:03.566 --> 55:05.591
- Hello?

55:05.635 --> 55:09.594
Are you there?
Paul, help me.

55:09.639 --> 55:11.800
- Paul.
- Please stop.

55:13.743 --> 55:16.507
- Oh...

55:18.248 --> 55:20.580
I'm the only one
who can hear you now.

55:22.686 --> 55:24.654
I'd be very careful
if I were you.

55:24.688 --> 55:27.816
The dead have such a hold
over the living.

55:27.857 --> 55:31.315
- What do you mean?
- He still feels your presence.

55:31.361 --> 55:33.625
You're only causing him
more pain.

55:33.663 --> 55:37.190
If you really loved him, you would
accept your death and let him go.

55:37.233 --> 55:39.701
Then prove to me
that I'm really dead.

55:39.736 --> 55:42.068
Oh, you people.

55:42.105 --> 55:45.506
You always need proof.

55:52.315 --> 55:54.613
Why do l
look like a corpse?

55:54.651 --> 55:56.744
Because you are a corpse.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.767
It's time you finally
accepted the truth.

56:13.803 --> 56:15.270
You are dead.

56:15.305 --> 56:17.170
You will never live again.

56:23.213 --> 56:25.977
I am dead.

57:53.403 --> 57:55.633
Bad dream?

57:55.672 --> 57:57.867
I had the craziest dream.

57:57.907 --> 58:00.967
I dreamt that I was in a car crash
and I was dead.

58:01.010 --> 58:05.037
Have you ever had a dream
where you were dead?

58:07.817 --> 58:09.808
Paul?

58:13.957 --> 58:16.391
- Paul?
- Shh shh shh.

58:16.426 --> 58:18.656
What are you doing?

58:18.695 --> 58:22.256
Keep your voice down.
You'll wake the neighbors.

58:22.298 --> 58:25.233
You don't have any neighbors.

58:25.268 --> 58:28.237
Did you ever love me?
Did you?

58:30.139 --> 58:31.800
Say it.

58:32.876 --> 58:34.639
- Say you love me.

58:36.579 --> 58:38.410
Are you gonna get that?

58:38.448 --> 58:41.508
Me? No.
It's probably for Eliot.

58:46.689 --> 58:50.090
Is it always like this?

58:52.362 --> 58:54.990
- What do you mean?
- I thought that when you died

58:55.031 --> 58:57.591
you wouldn't feel
any more pain.

58:58.835 --> 59:01.633
You wouldn't have
to struggle anymore.

59:01.671 --> 59:04.834
But it just never stops, does it?

59:11.981 --> 59:14.950
I'll pick up the deceased
from the hospital.

59:16.419 --> 59:19.013
Yes. This afternoon?

59:19.055 --> 59:21.751
It'll be fine.

59:23.359 --> 59:26.385
It's my pleasure, Mr. Miller.
Thank you.

59:31.234 --> 59:33.566
I'll leave you
to sort out her things.

59:33.603 --> 59:35.434
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:10.333
Okay.

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.068
Oh, wait, I want to take
a picture.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.099
Okay, smile.

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:17.308
- Nice.
- Hey, I got this for you.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.872
Aw, it's beautiful.

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.146
You're beautiful.

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:23.948
I'll race you to the lake.

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:25.921
Oh, I'm not playing
your little games. No.

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.185
I'll make it worth your while.

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.424
Come on!

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:35.926
- Uh-oh.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:38.263
What are you doing?

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.269
- Don't let go of me.
- I won't.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:41.531
I'll never let you go.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.565
What's that for?

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:23.901
His mouth- keep it closed.

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:47.960
Now the eyes.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.609
Does he have family?

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:57.169
Yes. A brother.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:02:00.649
He's coming in later.

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.612
Did my mother cry
when she saw me?

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:09.719
I'm sorry.

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:14.494
Did Paul?

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:18.491
That's not important anymore.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.628
I need to know.

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.503
We had an argument.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:29.272
I tried to stop her.

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:31.940
No.

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:35.075
No, he didn't.

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.717
You should rest.

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:49.058
You're getting weaker.
It's almost time.

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:54.395
Can I ask you a question?

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.905
Yes, of course.

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:03.041
Why do we die?

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:07.774
To make life important.

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:58.323
- Mr. Coleman?
- Yeah?

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.858
My name's Jack.

01:04:00.903 --> 01:04:02.268
Hi. Hi, Jack.

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:04.170
How'd you know my name?

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:06.141
Ms. Taylor was my teacher.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.473
I saw her last night.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.342
What?

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:12.847
I was going past the funeral home

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:15.749
and...

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:17.844
Ms. Taylor stood there.

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:20.946
In the window.

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.821
Wearing a red dress.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.327
Don't say things like that.
She doesn't even have a red dress.

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:27.022
- You think I'm lying?
- Look,

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:29.930
Jack, I'm not in the mood, okay?

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:32.434
- She needs your help.
- Anna's dead!

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.959
Your teacher is dead.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:38.197
I can't help her anymore.

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.833
Maybe you just don't
love her anymore.

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:43.272
- How dare you, you little fuck!
- Hey, whoa whoa whoa!

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:45.542
You think this is funny,
huh, you little weird shit?

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:48.345
Stay there.

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.682
- Are you okay, honey?
- What is wrong with him?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.984
- Oh my God.
- Come on, let's go.

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:56.685
Jack, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, kid.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:59.194
I am so sorry.

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:21.139
Mrs. Whitehall...

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:24.719
Susan.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.881
I hope you found
what you were looking for.

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.993
I really enjoyed
our time together.

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.929
Huh?
Anthony, shh shh shh.

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:41.198
Anthony, always confused.

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.288
How can I help you, Officer?

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.450
I'd like to see the body.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.056
Frank Miller
I'm his brother Vincent Miller.

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.758
- I called this morning.
- Mr. Miller, of course.

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:12.165
Please, I'm so sorry
for your loss.

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.930
I hope it's no trouble.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.370
I'd just kind of like
to see him before the funeral.

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:17.872
Yes yes, no trouble at all.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:24.040
Your brother's here.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.480
Ah.

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:31.411
You've done a beautiful job.
Thank you.

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:35.179
You should remember him
as he used to be.

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.490
That's the schoolteacher, isn't it?

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:42.520
Yes yes, very tragic.

01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:51.567
Something's not right here.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.105
Not right?

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:59.107
His smile.

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:02.413
Uh, it was a bit more...

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:03.816
smiley.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:06.686
Smiley? Permit me.

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:12.917
Uh, a little more.

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:15.954
That's it, yes, thank you.

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:18.831
We can fix that.
Glad to be of help.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.860
Do you mind if I have a couple
of minutes alone with him?

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.665
No, not at all.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.733
- I'll be outside.
- All right, thanks.

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:52.400
Oh.

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:58.805
- I'm sorry.

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:01.309
I, uh... I didn't

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:06.112
I think I should go now.

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:08.639
I'll see you at the service?

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:10.481
Thank- thank you.

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:18.792
I just told you.
That was your brother.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.495
You had an accident.
You're dead.

01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:25.591
Why do you people
never listen to me?

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:31.997
No, it's not a gift.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:34.600
It's a curse.

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:39.104
I take care of each of you
as if you were my children.

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:43.776
I wash the shit from your bodies.
I dress you.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.082
I try everything to make you
look more beautiful

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.055
than when you were alive
and what do you do?

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.752
You argue with me
as if it was my fault you're dead,

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:51.953
as if I was to blame.

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:54.622
You're not talking to me now?
What?

01:08:54.662 --> 01:08:56.563
Hmm? What?

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:58.930
You don't want to?

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:02.368
You don't talk because...

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:05.635
you have nothing to say.

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:09.742
And you have nothing to say

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:13.475
because you're a corpse.

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:15.108
Uh uh! No.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.142
Now I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.229
I'm off to school.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.765
Stop the clock.
You have 25 seconds left.

01:09:38.807 --> 01:09:40.832
You had the right idea,
but let me give you one little tip.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:09.035
What's it like?

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.936
Are you afraid?

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:13.441
- Jack.

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:18.078
You have an empathy
with the dead.

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:23.885
You are drawn to them
just as they are drawn to you.

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:25.682
That's a rare gift.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:28.019
I know you saw Anna.

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:33.120
You're frightened by it, yes?

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:35.753
You shouldn't be afraid.

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:39.325
Christ had the same gift.

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.427
He raised Lazarus

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.563
and spoke to the dead.

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:46.074
You spoke to Ms. Taylor?

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:48.008
Yes.

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:50.978
- You've spoken to others?
- Oh, yes, many others.

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:54.607
Who was the first one
you spoke to?

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:58.181
My mother.

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.948
You shouldn't be afraid.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.357
Other people...

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:06.418
they won't understand.

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.362
They don't see what we see.

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.466
I can help you.

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:16.403
I can teach you.

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:51.203
She was in the window,
wearing a red dress.

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:54.973
Anna, I'm sorry.

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.757
Deacon!

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:17.925
Mr. Coleman, pleasure.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.399
She's not dead, is she?

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:22.836
- Mr. Coleman?
- Someone saw her.

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:24.839
- I'm sorry?
- One of Anna's students

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:27.273
saw her in the window.

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:30.005
Oh, you mean Jack.

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:34.905
- You know him.
- Of course I know him.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.248
He often comes around here.

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.811
He's an 11-year-old boy,
Mr. Coleman,

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:42.881
and like all young boys
has a vivid imagination.

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:45.655
- Now if you'll excuse me.
- I don't think he imagined it.

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.855
I think he really saw her.

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.258
With all due respect,

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.268
maybe you just want
to believe he saw her.

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:54.701
Fuck you.

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:56.261
Anna!

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:57.636
Mr. Coleman.

01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:00.233
Anna!

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:06.314
- Anna!
- Mr. Coleman.

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:08.873
- I think you should leave.
- Anna!

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:11.708
Anna!

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.695
She's in here, isn't she?

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:29.201
Give me the fucking key, please.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:30.865
Anna!

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:33.704
She's dead.
You need to let her go.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:36.040
She's accepted her death

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:38.308
and now she's at peace.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:45.182
Please, Anna, I'm sorry.

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.287
I can't do it.

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:51.918
I can't live without you.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.292
Anna!
Open the door, please.

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:57.628
Mr. Coleman, she's dead.

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:01.193
I know what you're going through.
Denial's a natural part of grieving,

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:03.033
but you have to accept she's gone.

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:05.869
- She needs my help.
- You can't help her anymore.

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:08.342
Believe me.

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:15.145
Anna! Hey!

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.746
Give me the key.
Give me the fucking key.

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:20.584
Mr. Coleman, do you want
me to call the police?

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:27.457
I'll save you the trouble.

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:49.483
I need you to issue
a search warrant.

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:53.044
I need a fucking search warrant, Tom.
You gonna help me out or not?

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:54.919
- Paul, sit down.
- Tom, I don't have time.

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:57.391
Sit down.

01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:01.222
I just got a call
from Eliot Deacon.

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:03.697
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.996
He won't let me see her.
He's keeping her. She's not dead.

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:08.400
She was in a car accident, Paul.
Her car was wrecked, remember?

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:10.803
- It's downstairs.
- She's not dead.

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:13.399
Tom, she's not dead!

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:17.211
Here's the coroner's report.

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.075
The paramedics phoned it in.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:23.243
They only checked
for eye dilation and pulse.

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:26.277
The doctor signed the death certificate
without seeing the body.

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:28.516
- So?
- So there was no EEG, nothing.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.752
- He could have drugged her and-
- Drugged her?

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.316
- Yes!
- Actually, Chief,

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.556
um, there are drugs like that.

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:36.461
Yes.

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:39.467
Hydronium bromide,
total paralysis within seconds,

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:41.469
heartbeat slows to almost nothing.

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:43.437
Thank you. Tom, listen,

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:45.497
the little kid Jack, he saw her.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:48.601
I saw her.
She was on the slab dead.

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:50.703
- No no!
- I have seen dead bodies.

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:53.306
- Believe me, she was definitely dead.
- No no no!

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:56.806
Tom, listen, go down there.
Just check the place out.

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:59.787
On what grounds?
You have any evidence?

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:03.953
No.

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.425
But-but- no.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.291
Do you have anything?

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:13.499
I think she may have called me.

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:16.026
Called you?

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.767
Collect or long distance?

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:21.332
Fuck off!

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:24.442
Let me get this straight,

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:28.506
first you hit a fucking kid,

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:31.041
then you attack Deacon,

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:34.112
and now you're telling me

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:36.716
that your dead girlfriend

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:38.953
called you?

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:42.054
You're losing it, pal.

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:44.657
You need to pull yourself
together here.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.463
Okay?

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:49.063
Yeah.

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:52.130
You're gonna see her
tomorrow at the funeral.

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:54.540
And that will help.

01:16:54.576 --> 01:16:57.010
That'll give you closure.
It's what you need.

01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:59.275
You need to let go right now, Paul.

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:03.644
You just gotta let go.

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:13.424
Why do I have to get dressed?

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:16.363
Tomorrow's your funeral.

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:18.889
- Already?
- I told you,

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:21.596
you only had three days.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:25.164
I told you to use your time well.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:32.279
I have so many regrets.

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:37.877
I have nothing but regrets.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.854
I wanted a different life.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:44.358
Then why didn't you do
something about it?

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:47.918
I tried.

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:51.994
Nothing ever seemed to change.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.304
I woke up every day.

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:59.000
I took a shower.

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:02.977
Drove in the same traffic to work.

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:05.138
Went home.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.910
Went to sleep.

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:11.009
Woke up again.

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:13.613
Nothing was ever different.

01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:15.987
What did you really
want from life?

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:19.260
I wanted to be happy.

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:22.092
Happy. You all say
you wanted to be happy.

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.791
What does that mean?

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:26.096
Don't you understand
that's the whole point?

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:28.329
I- I don't know.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.065
Yes, you do.

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:32.539
You're just too scared
to admit it to yourself.

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:35.668
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.544
- I just want it to be over.
- What did you want from life?

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.548
I don't fucking know.

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:41.981
Yes, you do. What did you want?

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:44.611
- I wanted love.
- What did you want, Anna?

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:46.848
I wanted love.

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:50.449
You had love.
Paul loved you.

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:54.460
You don't understand.

01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:57.863
I wanted to love.

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:01.226
I was too scared.

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:05.468
My mother...

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:11.238
when I was little I learned that...

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:15.373
Ioving someone
meant getting hurt.

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:22.187
So I decided not to love anyone

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.158
so I'd never get hurt again.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.193
I kept pushing Paul away.

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:33.601
He thought I didn't love him.

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:38.232
Did you?

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:41.367
He was the only one I loved.

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:47.711
But I could never say it.

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:54.047
And then he stopped loving me.

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:02.562
What would you do if you had
another chance?

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.562
I don't know.

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:27.913
Well?
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:14.221
I thought you were different.

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:17.322
You all say you're scared of death,

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:21.699
but the truth is
you're more scared of life.

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:31.005
I'm glad I'm dead.

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:36.249
I'm glad it's over.

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:52.667
You said you could teach me.

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:02.470
It's only a hole in the ground.

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:07.047
- It's for
- Ms. Taylor?

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:09.073
Exactly. For Anna.

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:12.280
- She belongs here.
- Because she's dead?

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.414
No, because there's no life
left in her.

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:18.824
- What do you mean?
- Don't you see?

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:22.660
I'm the only one that can see all these
corpses wandering around aimlessly.

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:27.160
All they do is piss and shit,

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:30.000
suffocating us with their stench,

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:33.030
doing nothing with their lives,

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:36.976
taking the air away from those
that actually want to live.

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.812
I have to bury them all.

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:45.881
I have no choice.

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:50.748
Now there's two of us.

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:28.859
It's time now.

01:24:32.767 --> 01:24:35.793
You have to look beautiful
for your funeral.

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:50.545
This will relax your muscles.

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.644
Make your skin radiant,

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:55.155
as if you were still alive.

01:24:57.058 --> 01:24:59.356
This is how they're all
going to remember you.

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:01.555
Can I see myself one last time?

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:03.621
Hmm?

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:06.156
Can I see myself one last time?

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:10.597
Of course.

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:26.212
This is the end.

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:28.279
The last part's the most difficult.

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:31.156
You're going to have
to face it alone, but-

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:34.486
you'll be at peace soon.

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:52.743
- You lied to me.
- Anna,

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.079
we've been through this before.
You're just imagining.

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:58.608
- You lied to me.
- Anna, you're still

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:01.281
clutching onto life.

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:03.756
Anna!

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.952
Don't give
into your fears now.

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:08.724
- Don't give into your fear.
- You lied to me.

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:11.698
You're so-ooo close.

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:13.997
Why did you lie to me?

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:17.004
So close.

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:20.669
That's it.

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:45.826
Violets

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.097
they were her favorite flower.

01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:51.128
How did you know?

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.606
Violets seemed
appropriate somehow.

01:26:57.011 --> 01:26:59.206
We have come here today

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:02.045
to remember and to mourn
our Sister Anna

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:04.210
and give thanks for her life.

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:12.892
Dear God, as we stand here
in the silence of Thee today,

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:15.054
to commit Anna to the ground

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:17.462
and commit her spirit
into Your keeping

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:20.399
and comfort one another
in our grief,

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:22.460
in Your mercy...

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.375
I am the resurrection
and the life...

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.839
What is it?

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:06.174
She's so cold.

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:15.586
I'm so sorry.

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:39.844
Don't be scared.
It's better this way.

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.919
She's at peace now.

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:09.942
You said she was alive.

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:11.968
I never said she was alive.

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:13.878
I just said

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.439
I saw her.

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:20.987
You need a ride?

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:24.052
Okay.

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:26.583
I'll see ya.

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:29.289
- Mr. Coleman?
- Yeah?

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.992
Don't forget
to fasten your seatbelt.

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:47.407
Imagine, Anna,

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:49.780
the whole world- your mother,

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:52.115
your fiance, your friends

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:56.289
everyone has buried you.

01:29:57.558 --> 01:30:00.493
They have placed a stone
above your body,

01:30:00.528 --> 01:30:02.996
and they've said their goodbyes

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:06.158
and gone back to their TV dinners

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.168
and shopping malls thinking

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:10.636
that this is never
going to happen to them.

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:22.307
- I'd give anything...
- They said I wasn't gonna...

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:25.683
- I'm not
- I know I'm not dead.

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:34.723
Think about it, Anna.

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:41.164
Think about it
while you still can.

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.025
No.

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:11.689
No no.

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:14.064
No, I'm alive.

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.431
God, no, help!

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:29.883
Oh, shit.

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:34.418
Don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.717
Go to hell.

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:39.392
Mr. Coleman, I think

01:31:39.427 --> 01:31:41.987
you should show
a little more respect.

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:44.520
I know she wasn't dead.

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:49.827
Wasn't she?

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:57.872
You have no idea what happens
when someone dies,

01:31:57.912 --> 01:32:00.005
what happens to their body,

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:02.914
what happens
to their soul.

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:06.317
You think Anna was still alive
after the accident?

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:11.452
Maybe you're right.

01:32:14.395 --> 01:32:17.023
Maybe she's still alive.

01:32:18.232 --> 01:32:20.700
Why don't you go
and find out for yourself,

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:22.896
Mr. Coleman?

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:26.097
Find out

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.734
whether she's dead

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:30.903
or alive.

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:35.215
- You sick fuck!

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:38.116
- Oh.
- You psychotic fuck.

01:32:38.152 --> 01:32:40.245
You don't have much time left.

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:41.721
What's he doing?

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:53.696
Don't be scared.

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:55.998
It's better this way.

01:33:14.455 --> 01:33:15.922
Let me out!

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:20.026
Come on.

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:22.420
- Paul!

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:33.703
No.

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:26.024
Is it over?

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:33.728
Yes, Jack, it's over.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.690
Okay.

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:04.857
Anna?

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:08.426
Okay, Anna.
Anna, I'm here.

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:11.302
I'm here.

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:13.203
Oh my God.

01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:17.576
Anna.

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:24.751
Okay.

01:35:26.253 --> 01:35:28.744
Baby, please, please.

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:32.350
Please.

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:35.722
- Paul?
- Oh God.

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:37.856
Baby. Thank God.

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:39.297
- Paul?
- Yeah yeah.

01:35:39.333 --> 01:35:41.198
You came back for me?

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:43.601
I did.
I came back for you.

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:46.435
- You're safe now.
- I love you.

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:48.374
- I always loved you.

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:50.070
What's that noise?

01:35:50.111 --> 01:35:53.547
It's just the scissors for your clothes.

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:56.448
Eliot just put them on the table.

01:36:07.228 --> 01:36:09.628
Where am l?

01:36:09.663 --> 01:36:11.597
You're in a funeral home.

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:13.497
You're dead.

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:15.559
I'm not dead.

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:19.198
You had a car accident.
You swerved off the road

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.606
and you hit a tree.

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:23.269
I saw Anna.

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:25.175
You buried her alive.

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:30.010
You never made it
to the cemetery.

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:33.511
And you never saw Anna.

01:36:35.589 --> 01:36:38.149
- You're dead.
- I'm not dead.

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:43.058
You people,

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:45.258
you all say the same thing.

01:36:47.668 --> 01:36:49.795
I'm not dead.

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:16.392
I'm not dead.

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:19.058
* Wake *

01:37:19.099 --> 01:37:21.693
* From your sleep *

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:27.705
* You're drying off *

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:31.802
* Your tears *

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:34.474
* Today *

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:37.846
* We escape *

01:37:39.787 --> 01:37:43.484
* We escape *

01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:51.230
* Pack *

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:53.995
* And get dressed *

01:37:55.936 --> 01:38:00.100
* Before your father *

01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:03.439
* Hears us *

01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:06.571
* Before *

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:09.583
* All hell *

01:38:09.617 --> 01:38:15.749
* Breaks loose *

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.493
* Breathe *

01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:27.864
* Keep breathing *

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:33.471
* Don't lose *

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:37.508
* Your nerve *

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:47.186
* Breathe *

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:52.025
* Keep breathing *

01:38:53.227 --> 01:38:56.754
* I can't do this *

01:38:58.565 --> 01:39:01.295
* Alone *

01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:13.004
* Sing *

01:39:14.348 --> 01:39:17.283
* Us a song *

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:22.322
* A song to keep *

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:26.349
* Us warm *

01:39:26.393 --> 01:39:28.861
* There's *

01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:32.764
* Such a chill *

01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:38.570
* Such a chill *

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:46.378
* And you can *

01:39:46.413 --> 01:39:48.904
* Laugh *

01:39:50.884 --> 01:39:56.982
* A spineless laugh *

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:01.258
* We hope *

01:40:01.295 --> 01:40:05.061
* Your rules *

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:10.002
* And wisdom *

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:14.497
* Choke you *

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:17.374
* Now *

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:20.938
* We are one *

01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:26.283
* In everlasting *

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.120
* Peace *

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:33.058
* We hope *

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:35.857
* That you choke *

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:41.429
* That you choke *

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:47.864
* We hope *

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:51.606
* That you choke *

01:40:52.946 --> 01:40:57.007
* That you choke *

01:41:00.954 --> 01:41:03.149
* We hope *

01:41:04.525 --> 01:41:07.153
* That you choke *

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:12.965
