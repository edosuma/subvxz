WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.433
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.433 --> 00:03.574
THE EVIDENCE IN THAT LAPTOP

00:03.574 --> 00:04.575
COULD SEND THE GRAYSONS AWAY
FOR LIFETIMES.

00:04.575 --> 00:05.576
YOU REMEMBER MY FIANCEE.

00:05.576 --> 00:07.538
EMILY AND I ARE RE-ENGAGED.

00:07.538 --> 00:10.181
MR. PORTER, OF COURSE.
WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

00:10.181 --> 00:11.242
(whispering) BE CAREFUL
OF VICTORIA, JACK.

00:11.242 --> 00:13.644
SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
FREELY.

00:13.644 --> 00:16.247
CONRAD ORDERED
MY WIFE'S MURDER.
 DO YOU HAVE PROOF?

00:16.247 --> 00:18.049
(Conrad) LET'S SAY SOMEBODY WAS
 ABLE TO REMOVE THIS LEVERAGE.

00:18.049 --> 00:19.420
WE NEVER HAD THIS CONVERSATION.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.691
YOU'RE FIRED.
 SOMEBODY IS CLEARLY

00:20.691 --> 00:22.693
TRYING TO MANIPULATE YOU
AGAINST ME.

00:22.693 --> 00:25.356
TELL ME WHO IT IS.
 SOMEONE I TRUST
FAR MORE THAN YOU.

00:25.356 --> 00:27.198
AAH!
 (grunts)

00:27.198 --> 00:28.399
YAH!

00:28.399 --> 00:31.062
UHH! (grunts)

00:31.062 --> 00:33.064
WHAT IS THE INITIATIVE PLANNING
TO DO WITH CARRION?

00:33.064 --> 00:36.067
CARRION CAN'T OPERATE
WITHOUT MY MAGIC TOUCH.

00:36.067 --> 00:37.638
DANIEL, I'M PREGNANT.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.211
YOU HIT "ENTER," THE GRAYSONS
END UP WITH NOTHING.

00:40.211 --> 00:41.242
AIDEN, DON'T!

00:41.242 --> 00:43.114
IT'S A BLACKOUT.

00:43.114 --> 00:45.045
(electricity powers down)
 IT'S STARTED.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.225
(Emily) DARKNESS SCARES US.

00:54.225 --> 00:57.188
WE YEARN FOR THE COMFORT
 OF LIGHT

00:57.188 --> 01:00.191
AS IT PROVIDES SHAPE
 AND FORM...

01:00.191 --> 01:05.436
ALLOWING US TO RECOGNIZE,
 TO DEFINE WHAT'S BEFORE US.

01:05.436 --> 01:10.171
BUT WHAT IS IT
 WE'RE AFRAID OF, REALLY?

01:10.171 --> 01:12.843
NOT THE DARKNESS ITSELF...

01:14.575 --> 01:17.578
BUT THE TRUTH WE KNOW
 HIDES WITHIN.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.780
(Nolan) IT'S NOT
JUST THE POWER GRIDS.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.453
ALL THE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS
ARE FRIED--

01:22.453 --> 01:25.286
INTERNET PROVIDERS,
CELL CONNECTIONS, WiMAX, LTE.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.758
EVEN THE DUSTY
2G NETWORKS ARE DOWN.

01:27.758 --> 01:29.160
(sirens wailing in distance)

01:29.160 --> 01:31.322
WHAT IS GOING ON
OUT THERE?

01:31.322 --> 01:34.225
DO YOU HAVE A-A RADIO
THAT STILL RUNS ON BATTERIES?

01:34.225 --> 01:35.466
MAYBE A SURVIVAL KIT?

01:35.466 --> 01:37.628
SADLY, MY PLANS
FOR THE APOCALYPSE

01:37.628 --> 01:39.500
CONSISTED OF MAKING A LIST

01:39.500 --> 01:42.333
THAT STARTED AND ENDED
WITH "CALL EMILY."

01:42.333 --> 01:43.834
WAIT. I DO HAVE SOMETHING
SOLAR-POWERED

01:43.834 --> 01:45.206
THAT COULD BE OF USE.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.178
NO, WE CAN'T WAIT
UNTIL SUNRISE, NOLAN.

01:47.178 --> 01:50.110
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S ABOUT
A THOUSAND MILES ABOVE US

01:50.110 --> 01:51.842
IN GEOCENTRIC ORBIT,

01:51.842 --> 01:53.584
WHERE IT'S PRETTY MUCH
SUNNY ALL THE TIME.

01:53.584 --> 01:54.715
NolSat?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.417
WHAT DO YOU NEED
TO SET UP A CONNECTION?

01:56.417 --> 01:59.420
JUST A LAPTOP WITH SOME JUICE.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.453
I'M SURE WE GOT ONE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

02:02.453 --> 02:04.124
(sighs)

02:04.124 --> 02:06.397
WHAT THE HELL
ARE THEY UP TO?

02:06.397 --> 02:09.400
(horns honking)

02:09.400 --> 02:12.403
(people speaking excitedly)

02:19.210 --> 02:20.471
COME ON. THIS WAY.

02:20.471 --> 02:21.772
AREN'T WE GETTING
YOUR CAR?

02:21.772 --> 02:23.174
WON'T DO US ANY GOOD.

02:23.174 --> 02:24.144
THE BRIDGES AND TUNNELS
WILL BE JAMMED.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.376
IT'LL BE FASTER

02:25.376 --> 02:26.517
TO WALK TO
DAD'S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS.

02:26.517 --> 02:27.848
THAT'S 15 BLOCKS.
WHY THERE?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.220
BECAUSE IT'S
A SECURE BUILDING.

02:29.220 --> 02:30.381
COME ON.

02:30.381 --> 02:31.782
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL
MOM AND DAD

02:31.782 --> 02:33.384
ABOUT ME BEING PREGNANT,
ARE YOU?

02:33.384 --> 02:34.725
YOU THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION
I WANT TO BE A PART OF?

02:34.725 --> 02:36.227
GOOD, BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO YET.

02:36.227 --> 02:38.789
LISTEN TO ME.
YOU'RE GONNA TELL DECLAN,

02:38.789 --> 02:41.492
AND YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT
TOGETHER, ALL RIGHT?

02:41.492 --> 02:42.933
NOW STAY CLOSE.
COME ON.

02:42.933 --> 02:44.835
(horns honking)

02:44.835 --> 02:46.867
(flame whooshes)

02:51.442 --> 02:52.703
(door opens)

02:52.703 --> 02:54.405
THE POWER IS OUT
ALL UP THE COAST.

02:54.405 --> 02:55.876
ASIDE FROM A FEW BOATS,

02:55.876 --> 02:57.578
IT'S A WALL OF DARKNESS
OUT THERE.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.880
PHONE'S DEAD.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.752
MY CELL AS WELL.
I IMAGINE YOURS IS, TOO.

03:05.716 --> 03:08.559
(cell phone beeps)
 TOWERS GOTTA BE DOWN.

03:08.559 --> 03:12.423
IT'S GOTTA BE SOME KIND OF
FREAK ELECTRICAL EVENT.

03:12.423 --> 03:13.764
I SUPPOSE THE, UH, UPSIDE

03:13.764 --> 03:15.826
TO BEING SO BUSY
WITH CONRAD'S CAMPAIGN

03:15.826 --> 03:17.768
IS CARL'S AT HIS GRANDMOTHER'S
FOR THE WEEK.

03:17.768 --> 03:19.600
HOW QUICKLY THE SAFETY
OF OUR LOVED ONES

03:19.600 --> 03:22.673
TRUMPS OTHER DELIBERATIONS.

03:26.577 --> 03:29.240
FOR ME, THOSE THINGS ARE
ONE AND THE SAME.

03:31.242 --> 03:33.284
THAT RECORDING
IS FAR FROM A SMOKING GUN.

03:33.284 --> 03:36.717
I DARESAY IT BARELY
IMPLIES CONRAD LOADED IT.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.949
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD'VE EXPECTED
AS MUCH FROM YOU...

03:38.949 --> 03:41.252
KNOWING HOW YOU FELT
ABOUT AMANDA.

03:41.252 --> 03:42.623
IT WAS SHE WHO CAME AFTER
MY FAMILY.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.955
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

03:44.955 --> 03:47.728
GIVEN YOUR LOW OPINION
OF ME,

03:47.728 --> 03:49.560
WHY TRUST ME NOW?

03:49.560 --> 03:51.462
I COULD EASILY ALERT CONRAD
OF YOUR PLANS

03:51.462 --> 03:53.464
THE MOMENT
THE POWER RETURNS.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.911
YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH
AMANDA'S FATHER, WEREN'T YOU?

04:02.343 --> 04:04.475
YES, I WAS.

04:04.475 --> 04:06.677
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT
CONRAD HAS A LAPTOP

04:06.677 --> 04:08.018
IN HIS POSSESSION

04:08.018 --> 04:09.850
THAT COULD PROVE HE WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING

04:09.850 --> 04:10.921
THAT HAPPENED
TO DAVID CLARKE?

04:10.921 --> 04:12.323
I'D WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S ON IT.

04:12.323 --> 04:13.984
THEN WE SHARE
A COMMON GOAL.

04:13.984 --> 04:15.986
'CAUSE WHATEVER'S ON IT,

04:15.986 --> 04:17.658
IT WAS ENOUGH TO WARRANT
AMANDA'S MURDER.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.961
NOW I'VE WORKED FOR
YOUR HUSBAND FOR SIX WEEKS.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.294
I'VE GONE THROUGH
YOUR HOME.

04:23.294 --> 04:25.996
BUT HE HAS A SAFE
IN HIS OFFICE

04:25.996 --> 04:28.369
THAT I CAN'T GET INTO.

04:28.369 --> 04:31.402
BY ALL MEANS.

04:31.402 --> 04:34.945
ALLOW ME TO SATISFY
BOTH OUR CURIOSITIES.

04:38.949 --> 04:41.952
(horns honking)

04:41.952 --> 04:43.314
(thuds)
 AH!

04:43.314 --> 04:44.555
(clatters)

04:44.555 --> 04:45.886
DAMN IT.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.719
IT'S CALLED PLEXIGLAS,
DUMBASS.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.892
WHAT DOES CHARLOTTE
SEE IN YOU ANYWAY?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.994
I GET
THE "FORBIDDEN FRUIT" THING,

04:53.994 --> 04:57.968
BUT... YOU ARE PARTICULARLY
LOW HANGING.

04:57.968 --> 05:00.000
YOU HAVE SOMETHING OVER HER?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.572
(laughs) YEAH.

05:01.572 --> 05:03.574
BLACKMAIL IS HOW I LAND
ALL OF MY GIRLS.

05:03.574 --> 05:06.907
JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN
THE INEXPLICABLE.

05:10.441 --> 05:13.584
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR DAD'S GETTING COLD.
 (door rattles)

05:13.584 --> 05:15.516
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF
HE COULD GET IT OPEN,

05:15.516 --> 05:16.987
THEN YOU TWO
COULD GO HANG OUT,

05:16.987 --> 05:18.619
AND CHARLOTTE AND I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO SEE YOUR FACE ANYMORE.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.651
SORRY.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

05:20.651 --> 05:24.995
(exhales) AND UNFORTUNATELY,
NEITHER ARE YOU.

05:30.701 --> 05:32.503
WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR WILLINGNESS

05:32.503 --> 05:33.934
TO SOLDIER ON, FOLKS.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.036
I DO, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU MAKE SURE

05:36.036 --> 05:37.568
THAT YOUR LOVED ONES
ARE SAFE.

05:37.568 --> 05:39.570
SO PLEASE
BE CAREFUL OUT THERE,

05:39.570 --> 05:42.873
AND WE'LL SEE YOU ALL JUST
AS SOON AS THE POWER RETURNS.

05:42.873 --> 05:44.014
OKAY?

05:44.014 --> 05:46.116
THANK YOU.

05:46.116 --> 05:48.819
(indistinct conversations)

05:50.821 --> 05:52.553
(beeps)

05:52.553 --> 05:55.686
(indistinct conversations
continue)

05:55.686 --> 05:56.787
YEAH.

05:56.787 --> 05:58.629
DID YOU MANAGE
TO FIND CELL SERVICE?

05:58.629 --> 06:01.532
(sighs) NO, JUST LEAVING
MYSELF A VOICE MESSAGE

06:01.532 --> 06:03.063
FOR MY CLOSING SPEECH.

06:03.063 --> 06:06.096
ASSUMING THE POWER'S BACK ON
IN TIME FOR THE ELECTION.

06:06.096 --> 06:07.638
OH, I SEE YOU DON'T SHARE
MY CONFIDENCE

06:07.638 --> 06:08.999
IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE
COMMISSION.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.941
TOO MANY YEARS
A MANHATTANITE.

06:10.941 --> 06:13.474
(chuckles) THE CHOPPER'S, UH,
FUELED UP AND READY TO GO?

06:13.474 --> 06:16.677
YEP. JUST DOWN THE STREET,
HIGH ATOP GRAYSON GLOBAL.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.979
YOU STILL PLANNING YOUR UPSTATE
BARN BURN IN THE MORNING

06:18.979 --> 06:20.781
REGARDLESS OF THE POWER?

06:20.781 --> 06:22.382
OH, NO. NO, NO.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.854
THE ONLY PLACE THAT CHOPPER
IS TAKING ME TOMORROW MORNING

06:23.854 --> 06:25.556
IS HOME
TO RETRIEVE MY WIFE.

06:25.556 --> 06:28.989
I WANT HER BY MY SIDE
THESE NEXT 24 HOURS.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.922
UNTIL THEN, I'M GONNA
RETIRE TO MY SUITE

06:31.922 --> 06:33.564
FOR A LITTLE POWER NAP.

06:36.126 --> 06:38.098
(woman) ALL FIVE
 NEW YORK CITY BOROUGHS

06:38.098 --> 06:40.671
AND ADDITIONAL OUTLYING AREAS

06:40.671 --> 06:42.903
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY POWERLESS

06:42.903 --> 06:44.935
FOR GOING ON FIVE HOURS.

06:44.935 --> 06:47.708
THUS FAR, AUTHORITIES ARE
 AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN

06:47.708 --> 06:49.540
HOW MULTIPLE POWER GRIDS

06:49.540 --> 06:53.013
IN ADDITION TO NUMEROUS
 COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS

06:53.013 --> 06:55.015
COULD HAVE ALL FAILED
 AT ONCE...

06:55.015 --> 06:56.416
CARRION.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.888
BUT I THOUGHT THE ONLY PERSON
WITH THE ABILITY

06:57.888 --> 06:59.550
TO ACTIVATE THE PROGRAM
WAS THE FALC0N.

06:59.550 --> 07:01.051
HOW COULD SHE DO THAT
IF SHE'S BEHIND BARS?

07:01.051 --> 07:02.753
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

07:02.753 --> 07:05.055
YOU DID IT FOR HER.

07:05.055 --> 07:07.027
(sighs) EMILY'S RIGHT.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.859
THE FALC0N MUST HAVE
ALTERED CARRION

07:08.859 --> 07:10.861
SO THAT WHEN WE HACKED
THE AMANDA CLARKE FOUNDATION--

07:10.861 --> 07:12.533
IT TRIGGERED
THE CHAIN REACTION.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.134
AND SHE MADE SURE THAT YOU
USED AIDEN'S ADMINISTRATION CODE

07:14.134 --> 07:15.506
TO SET EVERYTHING IN MOTION.

07:15.506 --> 07:16.667
EVERYTHING THAT WE DID
TO PREVENT THIS--

07:16.667 --> 07:17.968
WILL NOW PROVE
THAT I CAUSED IT.

07:17.968 --> 07:19.439
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

07:19.439 --> 07:20.210
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO
WHILE THE LIGHTS ARE OUT.

07:20.210 --> 07:21.512
THIS COULD BE CATASTROPHIC.

07:21.512 --> 07:22.673
AIDEN,
YOU NEED TO GO DARK.

07:22.673 --> 07:24.014
NO, I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THIS--

07:24.014 --> 07:25.215
NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME.
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

07:25.215 --> 07:26.677
I'M NOT GONNA SIT BACK
AND WATCH THE INITIATIVE

07:26.677 --> 07:28.479
TURN YOU INTO
THEIR NEXT DAVID CLARKE.

07:43.494 --> 07:45.195
CAREFUL WHERE YOU STEP,
JACK.

07:45.195 --> 07:47.237
IT'S BEHIND
THE DESK THERE.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.203
(door creaks)
 I'M NOT SURE THIS SAFE IS
BIG ENOUGH FOR A COMPUTER.

07:53.203 --> 07:54.945
(safe beeps)

08:02.613 --> 08:04.254
MAYBE WE SHOULD
KEEP THIS IN HAND.

08:04.254 --> 08:07.918
IF MY HUSBAND'S AS DIABOLICAL
AS YOU SEEM TO THINK HE IS,

08:07.918 --> 08:09.690
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT HE WOULD
DO IF HE CAUGHT US HERE.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.861
(closes drawer)

08:12.062 --> 08:13.564
(objects clatter)

08:21.231 --> 08:22.603
IT'S NOT HERE.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.134
ANOTHER DEAD END.

08:24.134 --> 08:26.076
(exhales)

08:29.109 --> 08:32.082
WHAT'S THIS?

08:32.082 --> 08:33.914
CONRAD KEPT A FILE
ON MY WIFE?

08:33.914 --> 08:35.686
NO, I DID.

08:35.686 --> 08:37.688
FOR ALL THE REASONS
I TOLD YOU.

08:37.688 --> 08:38.849
I DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE.

08:38.849 --> 08:39.950
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT,
PLEASE DO.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.221
YOU MIGHT
FIND IT ILLUMINATING.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.655
JACK...

08:44.655 --> 08:47.998
I'D LIKE TO ASK ASHLEY
ABOUT THIS MYSTERIOUS LAPTOP.

08:47.998 --> 08:49.560
ASHLEY DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE IT IS.

08:51.261 --> 08:53.063
I JUST MEAN, I DON'T THINK

08:53.063 --> 08:54.204
THAT SHE WOULD SIT
ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

08:54.204 --> 08:55.706
NOT IF SHE KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.110
OH.

09:00.110 --> 09:01.271
WELL, SHALL WE CONTINUE
THE SEARCH?

09:01.271 --> 09:02.773
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

09:02.773 --> 09:04.314
THE RECORDING'S GONNA
HAVE TO BE ENOUGH.

09:04.314 --> 09:05.916
YOU'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER
TO THE POLICE?

09:05.916 --> 09:07.547
TO THE PRESS.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.920
IF MY SHORT CAREER IN POLITICS
TAUGHT ME ANYTHING,

09:09.920 --> 09:13.884
IT'S THAT PEOPLE WILL LISTEN
TO ANYONE WITH A MICROPHONE.

09:13.884 --> 09:17.127
I WOULDN'T MISS CONRAD'S SPEECH
THIS AFTERNOON.

09:23.093 --> 09:24.635
IS THERE ANY WAY
TO MAKE IT SEEM

09:24.635 --> 09:25.966
LIKE THE AMANDA CLARKE
ACCOUNT

09:25.966 --> 09:27.137
WAS HIJACKED BY ANYONE
OTHER THAN AIDEN?

09:27.137 --> 09:28.699
YEAH, WELL, IN THEORY,
SURE.

09:28.699 --> 09:31.141
BUT WE ACCESSED EVERYTHING
THROUGH THE COMPANY MAINFRAME,

09:31.141 --> 09:32.272
WHICH I CAN'T TOUCH

09:32.272 --> 09:34.304
AS LONG AS THE GRAYSON SERVERS
ARE OFFLINE.

09:34.304 --> 09:36.076
AND BY THE TIME
THEY'RE BACK UP,

09:36.076 --> 09:37.848
THE AUTHORITIES WILL ALREADY
BE AFTER HIM.

09:37.848 --> 09:40.310
BUT I CAN SAT-LINK CARRION
TO TRACK THE INVESTIGATION.

09:40.310 --> 09:43.213
THAT WAY WE'LL KNOW
WHEN THE FEDS ARE ON HIS TAIL.

09:43.213 --> 09:45.786
OKAY, SO DO IT.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.123
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN AIDEN DISAPPEARS?

09:53.123 --> 09:55.696
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN...

09:55.696 --> 09:57.197
FOR YOU?

09:57.197 --> 10:01.201
I CAN'T THINK ABOUT THAT
RIGHT NOW.

10:01.201 --> 10:05.906
THE HELL? (sighs)

10:05.906 --> 10:09.710
(screeches)
 FALC0N REPROGRAMMED CARRION
TO REJECT MY PROMPTS.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.841
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

10:10.841 --> 10:12.112
JUST THAT
IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE

10:12.112 --> 10:14.214
BEFORE CARRION LIKES DADDY
MORE THAN HE LIKES MOMMY.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.916
MORE IMMEDIATELY,

10:15.916 --> 10:18.018
IT MEANS THAT AIDEN
IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.149
(typing)
 (sighs)

10:19.149 --> 10:21.822
I HAVE TO FIND TAKEDA.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.894
I THINK HE KNOWS
WHAT THE INITIATIVE IS UP TO.

10:23.894 --> 10:25.255
E-EMS, WAIT.

10:25.255 --> 10:28.098
UM, LOOK, I CAN RUN
CARRION DIAGNOSTIC ON AUTO.

10:28.098 --> 10:29.700
I...

10:29.700 --> 10:32.132
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE
OUT THERE ALONE. (chuckles)

10:36.236 --> 10:37.908
FEEL LIKE
PUTTING ON A SHOW?

10:37.908 --> 10:40.140
(crowd cheering)
 (man) HEY, CHARLOTTE,
 OVER HERE.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.712
HEY, IS YOUR PHONE ONLINE?

10:41.712 --> 10:43.173
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:43.173 --> 10:45.075
OH, MY GOD. YOU DOWNLOADED
THAT THING TO YOUR PHONE?

10:45.075 --> 10:47.317
(sighs)
 THAT WASN'T A PUBLICITY STUNT
AT ALL, WAS IT?

10:47.317 --> 10:49.049
YOU REALLY LIKE HER.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.852
WHATEVER, PERVERT.
STOP LOOKING FOR A THREESOME.

10:51.852 --> 10:52.983
THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED ME

10:52.983 --> 10:54.154
OUT OF THE PICTURE
FROM THE START.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.285
YOU CAN'T STAND IT
THAT SHE LOVES ME,

10:55.285 --> 10:56.827
BECAUSE WHY WOULDN'T SHE WANT

10:56.827 --> 10:58.228
A RICH,
DAMAGED PARTY GIRL INSTEAD?

10:58.228 --> 10:59.830
GOD, SERIOUSLY.
SHUT UP.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.092
DOES CHARLOTTE KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL?

11:02.092 --> 11:03.764
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT WOULD
BE EASIER COMING FROM ME.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.265
YOU KNOW,
THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.067
YOU SAY ANYTHING TO HER,
AND--

11:07.067 --> 11:09.269
YOU'LL WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
 (beeps)

11:09.269 --> 11:11.371
(lights click,
power whirring on)

11:11.371 --> 11:13.774
(huffs)

11:16.076 --> 11:17.778
(grunts)

11:21.281 --> 11:22.983
(indistinct conversations)

11:22.983 --> 11:24.154
(clank)

11:24.154 --> 11:25.415
(murmuring)

11:25.415 --> 11:27.217
WE ARE BACK, PEOPLE.

11:27.217 --> 11:28.188
(cheering)

11:28.188 --> 11:30.160
LET'S RECALL
THE GROUND TROOPS.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.421
(computers beep)

11:31.421 --> 11:34.965
WELL, THERE IS A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES.

11:34.965 --> 11:37.097
HAVEN'T I ALWAYS SAID,
MY CHILDREN CAN LIGHT UP A ROOM?

11:37.097 --> 11:40.300
(chuckles) HOW ARE YOU TWO?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.202
WALKING
FOR THE LAST THREE HOURS.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.134
I SWEAR, I CAN HARDLY
STAND ANY LONGER.

11:44.134 --> 11:47.077
WELL, THEN DON'T, OKAY?
HERE. TAKE MY KEY.

11:47.077 --> 11:48.378
UH, MARY. THERE YOU ARE.

11:48.378 --> 11:50.981
WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW CHARLOTTE
TO MY SUITE UPSTAIRS

11:50.981 --> 11:52.943
AND FIND HER
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES?

11:52.943 --> 11:54.945
SURE.
 THANK YOU.

11:54.945 --> 11:56.486
THANK YOU.

11:56.486 --> 11:58.118
TAKE IT EASY, ALL RIGHT?
 RIGHT THIS WAY.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.719
(indistinct conversations)

11:59.719 --> 12:00.891
WHERE'S EMILY?

12:00.891 --> 12:02.052
I DON'T KNOW.
PHONE'S NOT WORKING.

12:02.052 --> 12:03.223
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO REACH HER.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.194
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE.

12:04.194 --> 12:05.725
I'LL TRY HER FROM THERE.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.197
DANIEL, I WOULD STEER CLEAR
OF GRAYSON GLOBAL TODAY

12:07.197 --> 12:08.799
IF I WERE YOU.

12:08.799 --> 12:11.431
YOU THINK THIS IS
THE INITIATIVE, DON'T YOU?

12:11.431 --> 12:13.864
WELL, JUST, UH, TAKE IT
FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS

12:13.864 --> 12:15.866
IT'S BETTER TO ERR
ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION.

12:15.866 --> 12:17.237
ADVICE FROM YOUR MOTHER
AND ME

12:17.237 --> 12:19.069
THAT YOU SHOULD'VE FOLLOWED
FROM THE BEGINNING,

12:19.069 --> 12:21.171
BY THE WAY.

12:21.171 --> 12:22.773
LISTEN, I HAVE A FEELING

12:22.773 --> 12:25.275
THAT THEY JUST TARGETED A SLEW
OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES.

12:25.275 --> 12:28.148
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,
YOU CAN EXPECT INVESTORS

12:28.148 --> 12:30.150
TO BE TERRIFIED
THAT THEIR MONEY ISN'T SAFE.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.451
I MEAN, THEY COULD BE
MARCHING UP FROM WALL STREET

12:31.451 --> 12:33.223
WITH TORCHES AND PITCHFORKS
BEFORE THIS IS OVER.

12:33.223 --> 12:34.754
ALL THE MORE REASON
TO MAKE SURE

12:34.754 --> 12:36.887
THE EVIDENCE POINTS BACK
TO AIDEN MATHIS AND NOT ME.

12:36.887 --> 12:38.288
NO, LISTEN, SON,

12:38.288 --> 12:40.891
IF YOU WERE
THE INITIATIVE'S PATSY,

12:40.891 --> 12:42.292
WE'D KNOW BY NOW,
ALL RIGHT?

12:42.292 --> 12:44.835
(man) MR. GRAYSON,
YOUR HELICOPTER IS WAITING.

12:44.835 --> 12:47.237
AND I'M OFF TO PICK UP
YOUR MOTHER.

12:47.237 --> 12:49.800
THIS TIME, HEED MY ADVICE,
WILL YOU?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.843
SHUT DOWN THE OFFICE.
SEND THE EMPLOYEES HOME.

12:52.843 --> 12:55.075
GET YOURSELF BACK HERE
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS

12:55.075 --> 12:58.378
WITH YOUR FAMILY
WHERE YOU BELONG.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.484
I BELIEVE IT WAS YOGI BERRA
WHO ONCE SAID,

13:04.484 --> 13:06.556
THIS IS LIKE DEJA VU
ALL OVER AGAIN.

13:06.556 --> 13:09.119
YOUR GLIBNESS NEVER CEASES
TO CHILL ME TO THE BONE.

13:09.119 --> 13:11.261
HAVE YOU NOT GIVEN A MOMENT'S
THOUGHT TO YOUR CHILDREN?

13:11.261 --> 13:12.792
NEITHER CAME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.865
THEY ARE BOTH SAFE AND SOUND
AT CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS.

13:14.865 --> 13:16.026
OH.

13:16.026 --> 13:17.197
AND I BROUGHT THE CHOPPER

13:17.197 --> 13:18.168
TO PERSONALLY ESCORT YOU
TO TOWN

13:18.168 --> 13:19.870
FOR A CAMERA-READY REUNION.

13:19.870 --> 13:21.431
MM. WELL, YOU SEEM
AWFULLY CONFIDENT

13:21.431 --> 13:23.233
THAT THIS ELECTION'S GOING
TO TURN IN YOUR FAVOR.

13:23.233 --> 13:26.907
WELL, IT ALREADY HAS,
THANKS TO YOU, IN PART.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.238
YOU MAY NOT HAVE DRIVEN

13:28.238 --> 13:30.410
THE FINAL NAIL
IN MY OPPONENT'S COFFIN,

13:30.410 --> 13:32.042
BUT BY RECORDING
YOUR CONVERSATION

13:32.042 --> 13:34.284
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE ABOUT
HIS TRAGIC HEART CONDITION,

13:34.284 --> 13:36.086
YOU DEFTLY MADE
THE PUBLIC AWARE

13:36.086 --> 13:37.918
OF HIS IMMINENT NEED
OF ONE.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.290
I WOULDN'T EXPECT
ANY CONCESSION CALLS JUST YET.

13:40.290 --> 13:43.924
JACK PORTER KNOWS
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE "AMANDA."

13:43.924 --> 13:45.225
AND HE'S DETERMINED
TO FIND THE COMPUTER

13:45.225 --> 13:46.927
THAT LED
TO AMANDA'S DEATH.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.329
THAT'S WHY HE JOINED
YOUR CAMPAIGN. (sips)

13:49.329 --> 13:52.132
WELL, LUCKILY FOR ALL OF US,
THE COMPUTER HE SEEKS

13:52.132 --> 13:54.935
IS CURRENTLY DETERIORATING
SOMEWHERE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.138
OH. JACK SAID HE WAS
IN POSSESSION OF IT

13:58.138 --> 13:59.239
UP UNTIL THE FUNERAL.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.211
HE'S CONVINCED
THAT YOU STOLE IT BACK.

14:01.211 --> 14:03.173
NO, IT WASN'T ME.

14:03.173 --> 14:05.145
TRASK, PERHAPS?

14:05.145 --> 14:06.846
WELL, WHATEVER THE ANSWER,

14:06.846 --> 14:08.879
HE'S GOING TO SABOTAGE
YOUR 4:00 PRESS CONFERENCE

14:08.879 --> 14:10.280
THIS AFTERNOON

14:10.280 --> 14:12.322
WITH A RECORDING OF YOU
AND NATE RYAN.

14:12.322 --> 14:14.524
WELL, APPARENTLY, YOU ARE
VERY EAGER TO PRESERVE

14:14.524 --> 14:16.887
MY CHANCES OF VICTORY,
MY DEAR.

14:16.887 --> 14:18.989
(cup clatters)
 I THINK YOU'LL MAKE
A FINE GOVERNOR.

14:18.989 --> 14:23.193
YOU THINK I'LL MAKE
A FINE RESIDENT OF ALBANY.

14:23.193 --> 14:24.534
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
I'LL SIMPLY INSTRUCT ASHLEY

14:24.534 --> 14:26.236
TO MAKE SURE THAT
HE'S BARRED FROM THE GATES

14:26.236 --> 14:27.397
THIS AFTERNOON.

14:27.397 --> 14:29.139
SHE'S IN IT WITH HIM,
YOU FOOL.

14:29.139 --> 14:31.301
OH, MY POOR CONRAD.

14:31.301 --> 14:33.904
YET ANOTHER FEMALE CONQUEST
HELL-BENT ON YOUR DESTRUCTION.

14:33.904 --> 14:37.177
IT'S LIKE...
DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.278
(crunches)

14:38.278 --> 14:39.649
(exhales)

14:42.612 --> 14:45.415
TAKEDA?

14:52.622 --> 14:54.995
(Nolan) OH, MY GOD.

14:56.626 --> 14:59.329
(both panting)

14:59.329 --> 15:00.500
DON'T TOUCH HIM.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.903
(panting)

15:15.085 --> 15:17.617
WHO WAS DAVID CLARKE?

15:17.617 --> 15:20.290
MY FATHER.

15:20.290 --> 15:22.192
AND HOW MUCH
DID HE MEAN TO YOU?

15:22.192 --> 15:25.055
EVERYTHING.

15:26.256 --> 15:27.998
HE MEANT EVERYTHING
TO ME.

15:27.998 --> 15:30.330
HE WAS A BAD MAN.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.461
SHUT UP.

15:31.461 --> 15:33.533
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.465
BECAUSE OF HIM,
MANY PEOPLE DIED.

15:35.465 --> 15:37.207
SO DID HE!

15:37.207 --> 15:40.110
(both grunting)

15:40.110 --> 15:41.611
GOOD.
 (grunts)

15:41.611 --> 15:44.414
I NEED THAT ANGER
AND CONFIDENCE.
 (panting)

15:44.414 --> 15:46.246
YOU WILL LEARN TO BALANCE IT

15:46.246 --> 15:50.080
WITH PATIENCE
AND OBSERVATION.

15:51.281 --> 15:55.125
I JUST WANT PEOPLE
TO PAY.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.557
THERE ARE TWO PATHS
TO REVENGE.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.489
ONE IS FAILURE.

15:59.489 --> 16:03.263
THE OTHER WILL SET YOU FREE
AT YOUR JOURNEY'S END.

16:03.263 --> 16:07.297
AND YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO'S GONNA SHOW ME THE WAY?

16:17.977 --> 16:21.551
(crying inaudibly)

16:32.062 --> 16:33.223
(inhales deeply)

16:33.223 --> 16:35.195
(exhales)

16:35.195 --> 16:37.297
(inhales and exhales)

16:37.297 --> 16:40.370
WHOEVER DID THIS MUST HAVE
GAINED TAKEDA'S TRUST.

16:40.370 --> 16:41.771
SOMEONE
FROM THE INITIATIVE?

16:45.675 --> 16:48.338
(blade zings)

16:48.338 --> 16:51.481
THIS KITANA WOULD'VE SLICED
THROUGH HIS SHIRT CLEANLY.

16:51.481 --> 16:53.343
(clicks)

16:53.343 --> 16:55.445
NOT IN A JAGGED PATTERN
LIKE THAT.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.320
IT'S THE ONLY BLADE HERE.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.751
THE KILLER TOOK
THE OTHER WEAPON.

17:04.054 --> 17:06.626
WHOEVER DID THIS
MOVED HIS BODY.

17:08.397 --> 17:10.099
WHY?

17:10.099 --> 17:11.761
RESPECT.

17:11.761 --> 17:13.563
IT WAS A FAIR FIGHT.

17:13.563 --> 17:16.205
THEY WERE EVENLY MATCHED.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.269
(sighs)

17:28.748 --> 17:30.380
(rock clunks)

17:34.324 --> 17:35.585
(huffs)

17:35.585 --> 17:38.488
TAKEDA'S INFINITY BOX?

17:40.130 --> 17:43.233
WHO IS THIS WOMAN?

17:43.233 --> 17:45.295
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.303
DO YOU THINK THIS COULD BE
TAKEDA'S KILLER?

17:53.303 --> 17:54.444
I DON'T KNOW.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.806
BUT IF HE IS,
HE'S PROBABLY CLEANING HOUSE,

17:56.806 --> 18:00.180
WHICH MEANS THAT AIDEN
COULD BE NEXT.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.253
(exhales)

18:03.253 --> 18:04.784
OR YOU.

18:07.457 --> 18:09.589
(replaces lid)

18:09.589 --> 18:12.462
(door creaks)

18:35.785 --> 18:37.247
(closes trash can lid)

18:37.247 --> 18:38.318
(Declan) CHARLOTTE.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.819
HEY, THANK GOD.
I WENT TO THE POLICE.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.451
THEY SAID DANIEL BAILED YOU OUT
AFTER THE BLACKOUT.

18:41.451 --> 18:43.223
SO I CAME HERE.
I FIGURED YOU'D BE HERE

18:43.223 --> 18:44.194
OR ACROSS THE STREET OR--

18:44.194 --> 18:45.355
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE,
DECLAN.

18:45.355 --> 18:46.526
WHY?

18:46.526 --> 18:48.298
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

18:48.298 --> 18:49.599
I TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

18:49.599 --> 18:51.301
HOW YOU FREAKED OUT
AND SHOVED ME TO THE STREET

18:51.301 --> 18:53.203
WHEN I SAID YOU WEREN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.

18:53.203 --> 18:55.665
WAIT. YOU--YOU TOLD HER
THAT I DID THAT TO YOU?

18:55.665 --> 18:57.337
YOU'RE COMPLETELY PSYCHOTIC.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.668
LOOK AT HIS HAND.

18:58.668 --> 18:59.839
LOOK, CHARLOTTE.
 OW! OW! GOD. I--

18:59.839 --> 19:01.211
I TOLD YOU.

19:01.211 --> 19:02.572
THIS IS--I-I GOT THIS
TRYING TO BUST OUT

19:02.572 --> 19:04.314
OF THE ATM VESTIBULE
THAT WE WERE IN.

19:04.314 --> 19:05.475
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
WHEN HE STOLE THE BAIL MONEY.

19:05.475 --> 19:06.646
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:06.646 --> 19:07.877
I DIDN'T STEAL
A THING FROM YOU.

19:07.877 --> 19:09.249
CHECK HIS POCKETS.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.520
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? I...

19:10.520 --> 19:12.222
(huffs) OH, MY GOD.

19:12.222 --> 19:14.524
WOW.

19:14.524 --> 19:15.855
CAN WE GET
SOME HELP HERE, PLEASE?

19:15.855 --> 19:17.257
SHE IS LYING.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.228
I'LL TAKE THAT.
 I DIDN'T TAKE ANY--

19:18.228 --> 19:19.389
THANK YOU.

19:19.389 --> 19:20.630
WE GOT A PROBLEM,
YOUNG MAN?

19:20.630 --> 19:22.332
NO, THERE'S NO PROBLEM.
SHE'S--

19:22.332 --> 19:24.634
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

19:26.396 --> 19:28.268
(Declan) SHE'S LYING!

19:28.268 --> 19:29.399
(man)
 FEARS OF WALL STREET TUMBLING

19:29.399 --> 19:30.900
WHEN THE MARKET
 REOPENS TOMORROW

19:30.900 --> 19:32.602
HAVE AUTHORITIES SCRAMBLING
 TO UNDERSTAND

19:32.602 --> 19:34.744
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
 WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT

19:34.744 --> 19:36.606
AND HOW OUR INFRASTRUCTURE
 COULD BE SO VULNERABLE.

19:36.606 --> 19:37.847
PEOPLE WILL BE
 ASKING THEMSELVES...

19:37.847 --> 19:39.209
MR. GRAYSON.

19:39.209 --> 19:40.380
TELL ME YOU'RE THE GUY

19:40.380 --> 19:41.511
WHO'S GONNA GET
OUR MAINFRAME BACK ONLINE.

19:41.511 --> 19:42.852
THAT WOULD BE
THE IDEA, YES.

19:42.852 --> 19:44.214
HOW LONG
ARE WE TALKING HERE?

19:44.214 --> 19:45.355
WE'RE LOOKING
AT A FULL REBOOT

19:45.355 --> 19:46.416
STARTING WITH
A COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC,

19:46.416 --> 19:47.757
SO I'D SAY, UH,
SEVERAL HOURS AT LEAST.

19:47.757 --> 19:48.918
SEVERAL? OKAY.

19:48.918 --> 19:50.290
WELL, AS SOON
AS THE SERVERS ARE UP,

19:50.290 --> 19:51.421
I WANT CONFIRMATION
OF DATA SECURITY.

19:51.421 --> 19:52.822
YOU UNDERSTAND?
 YOU GOT IT, BOSS.

19:52.822 --> 19:54.594
ALL RIGHT.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.326
AND WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES,
 WILL THERE BE A WAY...
 INSIDE.

19:56.326 --> 19:58.398
TO RESTORE THE CONFIDENCE,
 OR WILL WE LOSE FAITH?
 (huffs)

19:58.398 --> 20:00.270
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS
 NOW EMERGING

20:00.270 --> 20:02.702
THAT THIS WAS
 A COORDINATED CYBER ATTACK,

20:02.702 --> 20:05.805
ORIGINATING FROM SERVERS
 IN TUNISIA AND BAHRAIN.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.508
THE QUESTION NOW IS
 BY WHOM...

20:08.508 --> 20:09.809
(mutes TV)

20:09.809 --> 20:12.382
IF MEMORY SERVES, THOSE ARE
THE VERY SAME COUNTRIES

20:12.382 --> 20:13.683
WHERE MR. MATHIS ACQUIRED
COMPANIES ON YOUR BEHALF.

20:13.683 --> 20:15.415
I GUESS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT I'M A LITTLE BUSY

20:15.415 --> 20:17.347
MAKING SURE THE AUTHORITIES
FIND A CLEAR RECORD

20:17.347 --> 20:19.319
OF AIDEN'S DEALINGS
WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.291
WELL, AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT
WE TOOK THE NECESSARY MEASURES

20:21.291 --> 20:22.792
TO PROTECT OURSELVES?

20:22.792 --> 20:24.824
IT'S TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T APPLY
THE SAME PROPHYLACTIC INSTINCTS

20:24.824 --> 20:26.596
WHEN IT COMES
TO EMILY THORNE.

20:26.596 --> 20:28.258
IT'S FUNNY HOW EVERYTHING

20:28.258 --> 20:29.699
SUDDENLY COMES CLEAR,
KNOWING SHE'S WITH CHILD.

20:29.699 --> 20:31.331
(scoffs)

20:31.331 --> 20:33.333
I-I... I DON'T KNOW
WHO'S FEEDING YOU THIS INTEL,

20:33.333 --> 20:35.435
BUT SUFFICE TO SAY, MOTHER,
IT'S CORRUPTED.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.237
I FOUND THE TEST
IN YOUR GARBAGE, DANIEL.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.009
NOW I UNDERSTAND THE REASON
FOR THIS SHOTGUN WEDDING.
 ALL RIGHT.

20:40.009 --> 20:41.911
ALLOW ME TO SPEAK
FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

20:41.911 --> 20:43.773
IF SHE'S WITHHOLDING
AT THIS EARLY STAGE,

20:43.773 --> 20:45.715
YOUR MARRIAGE
DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.

20:45.715 --> 20:47.246
LISTEN,
EMILY ISN'T PREGNANT.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.679
THE TEST WASN'T HERS.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.826
OH, DEAR GOD.

20:56.826 --> 20:59.459
CONRAD, THE PRESS
HAVE BEEN HOUNDING ME

20:59.459 --> 21:01.431
ABOUT MOVING YOUR SPEECH
UP TO 3:00.

21:01.431 --> 21:03.293
THE STAFF ARE PREPARED
TO ACCOMMODATE THEM.

21:03.293 --> 21:05.034
WELL, THE SIMPLE ANSWER
IS NO.

21:05.034 --> 21:07.767
WE ANNOUNCED THE SPEECH
WOULD BE AT 4:00,

21:07.767 --> 21:10.300
AND THAT IS EXACTLY THE TIME
I'M GONNA BE DELIVERING IT.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.601
OKAY.
I'LL LET EVERYONE KNOW.

21:11.601 --> 21:14.043
YEAH, UH,
WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION

21:14.043 --> 21:16.376
OF JACK PORTER.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.547
WHY?

21:17.547 --> 21:19.048
WITHOUT
JACK'S CONTRIBUTIONS,

21:19.048 --> 21:20.950
YOU WOULDN'T BE WHERE
YOU ARE NOW IN THE POLLS.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.883
YEAH, WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THAT I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT

21:23.883 --> 21:25.655
THAT WE'LL BE BETTER OFF
IN THE HOME STRETCH WITHOUT HIM.

21:25.655 --> 21:27.987
AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO POINT
IN DRAWING ANY ATTENTION

21:27.987 --> 21:29.519
TO HIS ABSENCE.

21:29.519 --> 21:31.461
JUST LET SECURITY KNOW THAT
HE'S NOT ALLOWED ON-SITE

21:31.461 --> 21:33.593
AT ANY TIME,
FOR ANY REASON.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.496
ALSO, UH, I DO TRUST
THAT YOU WON'T MENTION

21:36.496 --> 21:38.368
ANYTHING TO HIM DIRECTLY.

21:38.368 --> 21:40.029
OF COURSE NOT.

21:40.029 --> 21:43.533
(indistinct conversations)

21:45.034 --> 21:48.608
(clicking keys)

21:54.414 --> 21:56.646
(seagulls crying,
buoy bell rings)

21:57.987 --> 22:00.990
(cell phone chimes)

22:00.990 --> 22:03.092
(beep)

22:04.093 --> 22:05.425
(sighs)

22:05.425 --> 22:07.096
(beep)

22:08.498 --> 22:10.099
(error tone sounds)

22:11.531 --> 22:13.102
(beep)

22:13.102 --> 22:14.864
DAMN IT.

22:14.864 --> 22:16.806
(sighs)

22:22.672 --> 22:26.676
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING
IN JAPAN, AMANDA?

22:26.676 --> 22:29.519
(door closes)

22:29.519 --> 22:31.381
OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE OKAY.

22:31.381 --> 22:34.123
WHAT HAPPENED?

22:34.123 --> 22:38.388
TAKEDA WAS MURDERED.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.131
I'M SORRY.

22:42.131 --> 22:43.663
(sniffles)

22:46.365 --> 22:48.067
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

22:49.399 --> 22:50.940
SOMEBODY WHO WORKS
FOR THE INITIATIVE?

22:50.940 --> 22:52.101
I FOUND A BUNCH OF
SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS

22:52.101 --> 22:53.372
IN TAKEDA'S LOFT.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.144
I THINK THAT HE WAS
TAKEDA'S NEXT TARGET

22:55.144 --> 22:56.906
AND PROBABLY HIS KILLER.

22:56.906 --> 22:59.609
I WANT TO FIND HIM, AIDEN,
AND I WANT TO FIND HIM NOW.

22:59.609 --> 23:02.051
OR WE COULD JUST END THIS.

23:02.051 --> 23:04.854
JUST LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND.
GO.

23:04.854 --> 23:06.756
WHAT?

23:08.658 --> 23:09.819
COME AWAY WITH ME.

23:09.819 --> 23:11.861
WE--WE COULD
DISAPPEAR TOGETHER.

23:28.838 --> 23:30.880
(voice breaks)
YOU KILLED HIM.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.446
EMILY, LET ME EXPLAIN!
 EXPLAIN WHAT,

23:36.446 --> 23:38.117
WHY YOU MURDERED THE ONLY MAN
WHO EVER BELIEVED IN US,

23:38.117 --> 23:39.749
OR WHY YOU LIED ABOUT IT?

23:39.749 --> 23:41.150
(grunts)

23:41.150 --> 23:42.992
TAKEDA WAS COMING AFTER ME,
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND,

23:42.992 --> 23:44.824
WHEN I TOLD HIM I WAS GONNA
TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS.

23:44.824 --> 23:45.955
THAT WASN'T YOUR DECISION
TO MAKE.

23:45.955 --> 23:47.156
I WAS GONNA FINISH
WHAT I STARTED

23:47.156 --> 23:48.157
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

23:48.157 --> 23:49.559
NO, YOU WEREN'T,

23:49.559 --> 23:50.700
BECAUSE TAKEDA WAS NEVER
GONNA LET YOU FINISH.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.001
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:52.001 --> 23:53.733
WE WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES
AFFECTED BY FLIGHT 197.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.064
TAKEDA'S FIANCEE
WAS ON THAT PLANE

23:55.064 --> 23:56.836
WHEN IT WENT DOWN.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.568
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

23:58.568 --> 24:00.039
I KNOW THAT FLIGHT MANIFEST
INSIDE AND OUT.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.212
YOU THINK I DIDN'T INVESTIGATE
ALL 246 PEOPLE ON THAT PLANE?

24:03.212 --> 24:06.746
THERE WERE 247 PEOPLE
ON THAT PLANE.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.748
MAI AOKI--SHE WAS A 24-YEAR-OLD
FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.750
SHE TOOK THE JUMP SEAT
ON A DEADHEAD TO NEW YORK.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.081
THE JUMP SEAT
WAS NEVER RECORDED.

24:12.081 --> 24:13.483
PLEASE.
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

24:13.483 --> 24:15.755
TAKEDA TRAINED YOU
AS A SOLDIER FOR HIS WAR,

24:15.755 --> 24:17.086
NOT YOURS.

24:17.086 --> 24:18.227
AND WHEN I THREATENED
TO EXPOSE HIM,

24:18.227 --> 24:19.929
HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT ONLY ONE OF US

24:19.929 --> 24:21.230
WAS GONNA
GET OUT OF THAT ROOM ALIVE.

24:21.230 --> 24:22.662
I SWEAR.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.496
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

24:26.496 --> 24:28.097
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

24:28.097 --> 24:30.570
IF YOU KNEW ALL THAT TIME THAT
TAKEDA HAD A SEPARATE AGENDA,

24:30.570 --> 24:32.572
WHY WAIT UNTIL NOW
TO TELL ME?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.143
BECAUSE I KNEW HOW MUCH
HE MEANT TO YOU.

24:34.143 --> 24:35.975
I KNEW HOW MUCH
YOU FELT YOU OWED HIM.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.476
I FELT THAT YOU
WOULD'VE FELT OBLIGED

24:37.476 --> 24:38.808
TO HAVE TAKEN HIS MANTLE ON
AS YOUR OWN.

24:38.808 --> 24:40.179
I KEPT THIS SECRET FROM YOU...
 NO.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.150
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

24:41.150 --> 24:43.152
(both panting)

24:43.152 --> 24:45.555
(cell phone rings)

24:45.555 --> 24:47.156
(ring)

24:47.156 --> 24:49.689
LOOK, JUST--JUST IGNORE HIM
THIS ONCE, PLEASE.

24:49.689 --> 24:50.860
(ring)

24:50.860 --> 24:52.021
(sniffles)

24:52.021 --> 24:53.192
(ring)

24:53.192 --> 24:54.524
(beeps)

24:54.524 --> 24:56.626
(static crackling)
 DANIEL, HI.

24:56.626 --> 24:58.027
Ems, hey.

24:58.027 --> 24:59.228
DANIEL,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

24:59.228 --> 25:01.000
Y-YEAH,
YOU'RE BREAKING UP.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.102
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
 I'VE BEEN AT GRAYSON GLOBAL
ALL DAY.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.534
(line clicking)
 HELLO?

25:04.534 --> 25:05.875
I'VE JUST BEEN DEALING
WITH THIS I.T. GUY

25:05.875 --> 25:07.206
WHO'S TRYING TO GET
THE SERVERS UP AND RUNNING.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.538
CAN YOU--CAN WE MEET LATER?
 (voice cuts off) Daniel?

25:08.538 --> 25:10.840
(line crackling and clicking)
 EM? HELLO?

25:10.840 --> 25:12.011
(exhales) DAMN IT.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.282
(beep)

25:13.282 --> 25:14.884
WHERE--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

25:14.884 --> 25:17.286
TO STOP DANIEL FROM
IMPLICATING YOU IN ALL OF THIS.

25:17.286 --> 25:18.948
LOOK, I-I DID WHATEVER I DID

25:18.948 --> 25:20.720
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WAS BEST FOR YOU.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.293
ALL I EVER NEEDED FROM YOU
WAS THE TRUTH.

25:24.293 --> 25:25.655
(sniffles)

25:25.655 --> 25:27.156
PLEASE DON'T RUN AWAY.

25:27.156 --> 25:28.958
(huffs)

25:28.958 --> 25:31.060
I'M NOT RUNNING, AIDEN.

25:32.962 --> 25:35.164
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT YOU DID.

25:44.173 --> 25:45.715
(telephone rings)

25:45.715 --> 25:47.577
(ring)
 HELLO?

25:47.577 --> 25:48.778
(Conrad) Daniel.

25:48.778 --> 25:50.249
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT WE AGREED

25:50.249 --> 25:52.321
YOU'D SHUT DOWN THE OFFICE
AND GET YOURSELF BACK HERE.

25:52.321 --> 25:53.723
NO ONE'S HERE
BUT THE I.T. GUY.

25:53.723 --> 25:55.054
AS SOON AS THE SERVERS
ARE UP,

25:55.054 --> 25:56.686
I'M TURNING MATHIS IN
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

25:56.686 --> 25:59.328
LOOK, THE FEDS CAN CATCH ON
WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM YOU.

25:59.328 --> 26:02.331
THE MORE ATTENTION YOU DRAW,
THE MORE YOU RISK IMPLICATING

26:02.331 --> 26:04.293
your own involvement.
 (elevator bell dings)

26:04.293 --> 26:07.236
(elevator doors close)
 If I can't appeal to your sense
of self-preservation,

26:07.236 --> 26:10.269
PERHAPS I CAN APPEAL TO YOUR
SENSE OF DUTY TO THIS FAMILY.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.271
I need you by my side

26:12.271 --> 26:14.604
DURING MY CLOSING SPEECH
THIS AFTERNOON,

26:14.604 --> 26:17.306
4:00 sharp.
 YEAH, YEAH, FINE.
I'LL BE THERE. I'LL BE THERE.

26:17.306 --> 26:18.277
HEY. HOW ARE YOU?
 HEY.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.809
I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

26:19.809 --> 26:21.010
OHH.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.311
GOOD.

26:22.311 --> 26:24.954
MY DAD WANTS ME
AT HIS FINAL CAMPAIGN SPEECH.

26:24.954 --> 26:26.115
BUT I'M NOT GOING.

26:26.115 --> 26:27.787
THERE'S FAR MORE
PRESSING BUSINESS HERE.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.820
(exhales) WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE ARE ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES?

26:30.820 --> 26:32.662
I SENT THEM ALL HOME.

26:32.662 --> 26:34.293
YOU REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU

26:34.293 --> 26:37.166
THAT THE INITIATIVE
WAS PLANNING SOMETHING?

26:37.166 --> 26:38.768
YEAH.

26:38.768 --> 26:40.269
WELL, I THINK THEY'RE BEHIND
WHATEVER'S GOING ON.

26:40.269 --> 26:41.631
WHY?

26:41.631 --> 26:43.302
THEY'RE REPORTING
THE CYBER ATTACK

26:43.302 --> 26:44.974
ORIGINATED IN BAHRAIN
AND TUNISIA.

26:44.974 --> 26:47.807
EXACTLY THE SAME PLACES
WHERE HELEN CROWLEY

26:47.807 --> 26:49.308
HAD US BUYING UP COMPANIES.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.240
AIDEN MADE THOSE TRANSACTIONS,
DIDN'T HE?

26:51.240 --> 26:52.812
YOU HAVE THAT ON RECORD.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.383
ASSUMING THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
DESTROYED OR ALTERED.

26:54.383 --> 26:55.915
I CAN'T BE SURE
UNTIL THE MAINFRAME'S

26:55.915 --> 26:57.246
BACK UP AND RUNNING.

26:57.246 --> 26:59.789
FOR ALL I KNOW, MATHIS WAS
PATSYING ME THIS WHOLE TIME.

26:59.789 --> 27:02.892
(knock on door)
 YOUR SYSTEM'S DOWN
FOR THE COUNT, MY FRIEND.

27:02.892 --> 27:04.323
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.855
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,

27:05.855 --> 27:08.227
THE PROCESSOR CORDS WERE FRIED
IN THE POWER SURGE.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.358
SO I NEED TO REPLACE
BOTH OF THEM,

27:09.358 --> 27:10.960
WHICH COULD TAKE
ANOTHER 24 HOURS.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.401
(exhales) ALL RIGHT.

27:12.401 --> 27:14.834
I'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON
AS THE CORDS GET IN.
 ALL RIGHT.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.305
(groans and exhales)

27:16.305 --> 27:17.807
WELL, I GUESS THIS MEANS

27:17.807 --> 27:19.769
I'LL BE AT MY FATHER'S SIDE
AFTER ALL.

27:19.769 --> 27:21.310
YOU MIND JOINING ME?

27:21.310 --> 27:23.673
I WANT TO BE
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

27:23.673 --> 27:26.245
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA MAKE
A FINAL SWEEP OF THE OFFICE.

27:26.245 --> 27:27.376
(kisses) MEET ME
ACROSS THE STREET.

27:27.376 --> 27:28.948
4:00, OKAY?

27:32.381 --> 27:33.422
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

27:33.422 --> 27:34.854
(elevator bell dings)
 I LOVE YOU.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.258
(exhales)

27:40.329 --> 27:41.861
(man) MR. GRAYSON.

27:41.861 --> 27:44.063
WE FOUND A MAN TRYING TO
SNEAK IN THE BACK ENTRANCE.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.966
HE SAYS HIS NAME'S PORTER.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.397
(sighs)

27:48.397 --> 27:50.800
(indistinct conversations)

27:50.800 --> 27:52.371
DECLAN.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.203
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

27:54.203 --> 27:55.674
I NEED TO SEE CHARLOTTE.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.246
HE'S FINE.

27:57.246 --> 27:59.408
(indistinct conversations
continue)

27:59.408 --> 28:00.780
THANKS.

28:00.780 --> 28:01.911
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

28:01.911 --> 28:03.382
YOU CAN SHOW YOUR GRATITUDE
AT THE POLLS.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.214
I MEAN, YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH
TO VOTE, AREN'T YOU?

28:05.214 --> 28:07.156
WELL, IT SEEMS THAT DECLAN

28:07.156 --> 28:09.959
IS OLD ENOUGH TO PARTICIPATE IN
A VARIETY OF ADULT ACTIVITIES.

28:09.959 --> 28:12.291
CHARLOTTE'S GONE FOR A WALK
TO CLEAR HER HEAD.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.793
SHALL WE?

28:15.825 --> 28:17.166
I'VE ALWAYS FANCIED US

28:17.166 --> 28:19.168
AS HAVING
A... HEALTHY RESPECT

28:19.168 --> 28:20.269
FOR ONE ANOTHER.

28:20.269 --> 28:22.271
I'D SAY WE'VE HAD
OUR UPS AND DOWNS.

28:22.271 --> 28:24.703
A RESPECT BORN OF THE FACT
THAT YOU'VE UNDERSTOOD

28:24.703 --> 28:27.336
YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE
IN THIS FAMILY

28:27.336 --> 28:29.408
IN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ONE.

28:29.408 --> 28:32.181
SO IMAGINE MY CONFUSION
WHEN YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY

28:32.181 --> 28:34.383
TO SHOW UP HERE
AFTER EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

28:34.383 --> 28:36.345
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO CHARLOTTE ABOUT.

28:36.345 --> 28:38.147
THIS NEW FRIEND OF HERS--
REGINA--

28:38.147 --> 28:39.288
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE GOT
THOSE BRUISES,

28:39.288 --> 28:40.950
BUT I WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

28:40.950 --> 28:43.122
IT'S JUST THAT CHARLOTTE
BELIEVES EVERYTHING SHE SAYS,

28:43.122 --> 28:44.453
LIKE SHE CAST
SOME KIND OF SPELL ON HER.

28:44.453 --> 28:46.756
IT ISN'T A SPELL, DECLAN.
SHE'S PREGNANT.

28:46.756 --> 28:49.258
SHE'S WHAT?

28:49.258 --> 28:52.061
OH, I SEE
SHE HASN'T TOLD YOU.

28:52.061 --> 28:54.003
AND FOR GOOD REASON.

28:54.003 --> 28:56.165
THERE'S GOTTA--
THERE'S GOTTA BE A MISTAKE.

28:56.165 --> 28:57.166
OH, THERE IS,

28:57.166 --> 28:58.768
AND I AM DONE LOOKING AT IT.

28:58.768 --> 29:01.070
STAY THE HELL AWAY
FROM MY DAUGHTER,

29:01.070 --> 29:02.371
OR YOUR ABILITY TO PROCREATE

29:02.371 --> 29:04.513
WILL BE NOTHING
BUT A DISTANT MEMORY.

29:10.780 --> 29:12.281
OOH,
IT SEEMS THE PORTER BOYS

29:12.281 --> 29:14.083
ARE CAUSING THIS FAMILY
NOTHING BUT GRIEF OF LATE.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.254
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

29:15.254 --> 29:17.056
NOTHING.
I TOOK CARE OF IT.

29:17.056 --> 29:20.429
SO I TRUST THAT YOU'VE MANAGED
TO FIND A WAY TO STOP JACK

29:20.429 --> 29:22.361
FROM SHARING YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS
WITH THE MASSES.

29:22.361 --> 29:25.364
NO, OUR TRANSGRESSIONS,
DEAR, AND YES.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.466
I MEAN, IF YOU THINK I'D ALLOW
HIM TO COMMANDEER THE PODIUM,

29:27.466 --> 29:29.999
YOU'VE SORELY
UNDERESTIMATED ME.

29:29.999 --> 29:32.171
WELL, IT'S A HABIT OF MINE.

29:32.171 --> 29:35.274
A HABIT
YOU'D BE WISE TO BREAK.

29:40.049 --> 29:41.310
(sighs)

29:43.382 --> 29:45.815
(bag thuds)

29:48.787 --> 29:50.289
(cell phone chimes)

29:51.360 --> 29:52.962
(cell phone beeps)

30:00.069 --> 30:02.231
(indistinct conversations)

30:02.231 --> 30:03.302
(clicking)

30:03.302 --> 30:04.433
(beep)

30:04.433 --> 30:07.406
(telephone ringing in distance)

30:24.593 --> 30:26.395
(Nolan) AIDEN?

30:26.395 --> 30:28.898
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:28.898 --> 30:30.399
WHERE'S EMS?

30:30.399 --> 30:32.401
SHE'S AT GRAYSON GLOBAL
WITH DANIEL

30:32.401 --> 30:36.105
TO ASCERTAIN WHEN THE SERVERS
ARE GONNA COME BACK ONLINE.

30:36.105 --> 30:37.436
I'LL BE READY WHEN THEY ARE.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.607
DON'T BOTHER.

30:38.607 --> 30:40.309
IT'S TIME
TO ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES

30:40.309 --> 30:42.011
FOR WHAT I'VE SET IN MOTION.

30:42.011 --> 30:44.243
NOT IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHO'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE

30:44.243 --> 30:45.414
FOR ALL THIS.

30:45.414 --> 30:48.417
IF I CAN I.D.
TAKEDA'S KILLER, THEN...

30:48.417 --> 30:50.279
MAYBE WE CAN TAKE
THE SPOTLIGHT OFF YOU.

30:50.279 --> 30:52.621
THAT MAN DIDN'T KILL TAKEDA,
NOLAN.

30:54.283 --> 30:56.585
I DID.

30:56.585 --> 30:59.959
NOW I KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,

30:59.959 --> 31:02.531
BUT TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU,
I DID IT FOR EMILY.

31:06.635 --> 31:08.467
GIVE HER THIS FOR ME.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.369
PLEASE.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.902
(exhales)

31:15.975 --> 31:18.908
I WAS SUCH A FOOL...

31:18.908 --> 31:21.450
THINKING EMILY WOULD
WALK AWAY FROM HER REVENGE,

31:21.450 --> 31:23.652
ESPECIALLY FOR LOVE.

31:23.652 --> 31:28.057
OH, IF SHE DID IT ONCE,

31:28.057 --> 31:30.489
SHE'S... CAPABLE
OF DOING IT AGAIN.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.361
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IF SHE DID IT ONCE?

31:33.662 --> 31:37.466
I AS--I ASSUMED
THAT YOU KNEW.

31:37.466 --> 31:40.199
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
LAST YEAR,

31:40.199 --> 31:41.500
SHE IMMEDIATELY LEFT
FOR JAPAN.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.032
I...

31:43.032 --> 31:44.333
THERE WAS TOO MUCH
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

31:44.333 --> 31:46.075
EVERYTHING WAS GOING
OFF THE RAILS.

31:46.075 --> 31:47.406
SHE HAD TO WALK AWAY.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.378
I'M--I'M GETTING THE WHOLE
"WALKING AWAY" THING, NOLAN.

31:49.378 --> 31:51.440
WHAT I'M NOT GETTING
IS FOR WHOM.

31:56.145 --> 31:58.187
JACK PORTER.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.592
I GUESS I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
HARBORING SECRETS.

32:05.654 --> 32:07.926
I'M SORRY.

32:15.704 --> 32:18.037
YOU'VE BEEN
AN UNEXPECTED FRIEND.

32:22.611 --> 32:24.443
THANK YOU.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.548
(horn honks in distance)

32:29.548 --> 32:31.150
WHAT?

32:32.451 --> 32:35.224
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

32:35.224 --> 32:36.385
NOTHING.

32:36.385 --> 32:37.556
IT'S JUST,

32:37.556 --> 32:40.429
DECLAN JUST FREAKING OUT
LIKE THAT,

32:40.429 --> 32:42.391
STEALING YOUR MONEY--
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE HIM.

32:42.391 --> 32:44.433
YEAH, WELL,
YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE

32:44.433 --> 32:46.996
OF PEOPLE SHOWING THEIR
TRUE COLORS UNDER PRESSURE.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.499
YOU DON'T NEED HIM
TO RAISE THE BABY.

32:50.499 --> 32:53.342
WE COULD DO IT TOGETHER.

32:53.342 --> 32:55.004
(cell phone rings)

32:55.004 --> 32:57.606
(ring)

32:57.606 --> 32:59.478
(rings and beeps)

32:59.478 --> 33:01.210
HELLO?

33:01.210 --> 33:02.511
CHARLOTTE, WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST LISTEN TO ME?

33:02.511 --> 33:05.014
I SWEAR TO YOU, I NEVER
LAID A FINGER ON REGINA.

33:05.014 --> 33:06.615
She--she faked those bruises,
and--and I--

33:06.615 --> 33:09.058
I DIDN'T TAKE ANY MONEY EITHER.
SHE MUST HAVE PLANTED IT ON ME.

33:09.058 --> 33:10.419
AND WHY WOULD SHE
DO THAT?

33:10.419 --> 33:12.321
BECAUSE SHE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU
OR OBSESSED

33:12.321 --> 33:14.293
or I--just listen to me.
Check her phone.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.465
She's got that--that internet
video of you two kissing

33:16.465 --> 33:19.368
downloaded
like some stalker.

33:19.368 --> 33:21.370
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHY I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT.

33:21.370 --> 33:24.433
YOU... YOUR MOTHER TOLD ME
ABOUT THE BABY.

33:25.774 --> 33:27.406
MY MOTHER?

33:27.406 --> 33:29.408
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.080
I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU.

33:31.080 --> 33:32.381
I mean, if you would just
tell security

33:32.381 --> 33:34.113
to--to let me in
to the press conference--

33:34.113 --> 33:35.284
I'M NOT EVEN THERE
RIGHT NOW. I'M--

33:35.284 --> 33:36.485
ARE YOU WITH REGINA?

33:36.485 --> 33:40.519
NO. NO, NO, NO.
I'M--I'M WITH DANIEL. WE'RE--

33:40.519 --> 33:42.391
(line crackles)
 HELLO?

33:49.128 --> 33:52.361
DID YOU DOWNLOAD THAT TRENDIST
VIDEO OF US ONTO YOUR PHONE?

33:52.361 --> 33:53.502
NO.

33:53.502 --> 33:55.204
DID DECLAN
JUST TELL YOU THAT?

33:55.204 --> 33:57.366
HE'S A TOTAL LIAR

33:57.366 --> 33:58.437
AND A THIEF.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.369
LET ME SEE YOUR PHONE.

34:00.369 --> 34:02.211
NO.

34:03.512 --> 34:06.475
GOOD-BYE, REGINA.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.350
(man) YET WHILE NEW YORKERS
 CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE

34:11.350 --> 34:13.522
WITH THE LINGERING EFFECTS
 OF THE CYBER ATTACK,

34:13.522 --> 34:15.824
THE STATE ELECTION BOARD
 HAS YET TO DECIDE

34:15.824 --> 34:18.127
IF TOMORROW'S
 GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION

34:18.127 --> 34:20.188
WILL GO ON AS PLANNED.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.360
THERE ARE CONCERNS...

34:21.360 --> 34:22.661
(Emily) NOLAN, I SAW HIM.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.632
THE MAN TAKEDA WAS TRACKING
WAS JUST AT GRAYSON GLOBAL

34:24.632 --> 34:26.295
POSING AS I.T.
 (mutes TV)

34:26.295 --> 34:28.065
I TAKE IT YOU HAVEN'T FOUND
A MATCH.

34:29.598 --> 34:31.139
WHAT?

34:31.139 --> 34:33.772
EMS, AIDEN WAS JUST HERE.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.444
(sighs)

34:35.444 --> 34:39.077
HE TOLD ME
HE KILLED TAKEDA.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.409
(mutters)

34:40.409 --> 34:42.481
HE WANTED ME
TO GIVE THIS TO YOU.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.513
(rustles papers)

34:47.456 --> 34:49.158
WHAT IS IT?

34:49.158 --> 34:52.360
HER NAME IS MAI AOKI.

34:52.360 --> 34:54.623
APPARENTLY SHE WAS
TAKEDA'S FIANCEE.

34:54.623 --> 34:57.826
SHE DIED ON FLIGHT 197, TOO.

34:57.826 --> 35:00.098
TAKEDA HAD
HIS OWN REVEGENDA?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.131
YEAH, AND AIDEN KNEW
THE WHOLE TIME. HE LIED TO ME.

35:02.131 --> 35:04.433
OR... HE JUST
WANTED YOU TO SEE

35:04.433 --> 35:07.476
THAT THERE IS MORE TO LIFE
THAN REVENGE.

35:07.476 --> 35:09.738
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

35:09.738 --> 35:12.481
(sighs)
 (cell phone rings)

35:12.481 --> 35:14.143
(ring)
 IT'S JACK.

35:14.143 --> 35:15.314
(beep)

35:15.314 --> 35:17.386
JACK, WH-WHERE ARE YOU?

35:17.386 --> 35:18.417
I'M DOWNTOWN.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.118
HEY, YOU REMEMBER THE COMPUTER

35:20.118 --> 35:21.520
AMANDA USED
TO BLACKMAIL CONRAD WITH?

35:21.520 --> 35:23.692
YEAH, WHY?

35:23.692 --> 35:25.394
WELL, I'M ABOUT TO GET
MY HANDS ON IT.

35:25.394 --> 35:27.456
I need your help
to crack the password.

35:27.456 --> 35:29.127
NO, NO, JACK,
SLOW YOUR ROLL.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.499
WH-WHERE ARE YOU
GETTING IT FROM?

35:30.499 --> 35:32.761
I'M PICKING IT UP FROM
GRAYSON GLOBAL IN A FEW MINUTES.

35:32.761 --> 35:36.405
(indistinct conversations)

35:45.814 --> 35:47.346
I'M GONNA BRING
THAT BASTARD DOWN

35:47.346 --> 35:48.617
once and for--
 (error tone beeps)

35:48.617 --> 35:49.848
WE LOST HIM.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.180
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
 (cell phone clatters)

35:51.180 --> 35:52.521
I THREW THAT COMPUTER
IN THE OCEAN MYSELF.

35:52.521 --> 35:53.852
(computer beeping)
 EMS, WE GOT A MATCH.

35:55.384 --> 35:56.625
GREGOR HOFFMAN.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.527
THREE TOURS
WITH GERMAN SPECIAL FORCES.

35:58.527 --> 35:59.828
SUSPECTED
OF KILLING A DIPLOMAT

35:59.828 --> 36:01.190
OUTSIDE A U.S. EMBASSY
IN NORTH AFRICA.

36:01.190 --> 36:02.531
HE IS AN ASSASSIN.

36:02.531 --> 36:05.464
HOFFMAN WASN'T AT GRAYSON GLOBAL
TO FIX THEIR SERVERS.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.495
HE WAS ONLY THERE
TO GAIN ACCESS.

36:06.495 --> 36:09.468
YEAH, AND JACK'S WALKING
INTO A TRAP.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.545
NOLAN, COME ON.

36:16.545 --> 36:17.946
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I'VE GOT BARS.
 WE'VE GOTTA KEEP MOVING.

36:17.946 --> 36:19.508
NO, I-I CAN'T!
EM, I'LL LOSE THE SIGNAL!

36:19.508 --> 36:21.250
JUST KEEP TRYING!

36:30.519 --> 36:31.920
(applause)

36:35.894 --> 36:39.568
(cheering)

36:44.633 --> 36:46.204
(cheering continues)

36:50.479 --> 36:54.443
THERE ARE BONDS IN THIS WORLD
THAT CANNOT BE SEVERED.

36:54.443 --> 36:57.316
AND THE BONDS FORGED
IN THE FIRES OF HARDSHIP

36:57.316 --> 37:00.449
ARE AS STRONG
AS THE BONDS OF BLOOD.

37:01.550 --> 37:04.423
WE NEW YORKERS ARE FAMILY.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.725
TODAY I AM PROUD

37:06.725 --> 37:08.727
TO STAND AMONGST YOU
IN THE MIDST

37:08.727 --> 37:11.960
OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE
A COWARDLY CYBER ATTACK.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.564
AN ATTACK MEANT TO THROW
OUR LIVES INTO CHAOS

37:15.564 --> 37:17.706
AND TO MAKE US SHRINK
WITH FEAR.

37:17.706 --> 37:19.308
(camera shutter clicks)

37:19.308 --> 37:21.570
BUT SHRINK WE WILL NOT.

37:21.570 --> 37:23.912
BECAUSE WE'RE NEW YORKERS.

37:23.912 --> 37:25.774
BECAUSE WE PRESS ON.

37:25.774 --> 37:27.516
BECAUSE WE PERSEVERE.

37:27.516 --> 37:30.579
AND WE WILL RISE ABOVE THIS.

37:30.579 --> 37:34.583
(cheering)

37:34.583 --> 37:36.325
JACK.
 (ring)

37:36.325 --> 37:38.256
COME ON. PICK UP.
 (ring)

37:38.256 --> 37:39.888
This is Jack.
 Leave a message.
 VOICE MAIL.

37:39.888 --> 37:41.290
(voice mail beeps)

37:41.290 --> 37:42.531
ALL RIGHT, JACK, DO NOT
GO INTO GRAYSON GLOBAL.

37:42.531 --> 37:44.493
YOU--YOU ARE BEING SET UP.

37:44.493 --> 37:46.765
GET OUT OF THERE. NOW.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.568
(exhales)

37:49.568 --> 37:51.400
(pants)

37:51.400 --> 37:53.001
(bell dings)

38:11.660 --> 38:13.492
(cell phone chimes)

38:32.681 --> 38:34.983
WHICHEVER CANDIDATE
YOU SUPPORT,

38:34.983 --> 38:36.985
IT IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN EVER

38:36.985 --> 38:40.719
THAT WE EXERCISE
OUR CIVIL DUTY.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.951
UH, THERE IS STILL...

38:42.951 --> 38:44.993
PLENTY OF TIME
TO GO OUT...

38:44.993 --> 38:46.955
(camera shutters clicking)
 AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIEND,
YOUR NEIGHBOR,

38:46.955 --> 38:48.657
YOUR FAMILY

38:48.657 --> 38:52.601
TO BRAVELY VENTURE
INTO THIS STORM OF UNCERTAINTY

38:52.601 --> 38:56.004
AND ELECT YOUR NEXT GOVERNOR.

38:58.567 --> 39:01.640
(applause continues)

39:01.640 --> 39:02.971
AND I IMPLORE YOU

39:02.971 --> 39:04.613
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VOICE

39:04.613 --> 39:06.875
IS HEARD IN THIS ELECTION.
 (cell phone chimes)

39:06.875 --> 39:09.618
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A VOTE.
IT'S AN ACT OF COURAGE.
 (numerous cell phones
beep and chime)

39:09.618 --> 39:11.750
IT'S AN ACT OF DEFIANCE
IN THE FACE OF THOSE...

39:11.750 --> 39:15.554
(cell phone chimes)
 WHO SEEK TO DESTROY
OUR WAY OF LIFE.

39:15.554 --> 39:16.755
A SOVEREIGN RESPONSIBILITY

39:16.755 --> 39:20.459
TO TAKE CONTROL
OF OUR OWN DESTINY.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.061
SO LET'S SEND THEM
A MESSAGE...

39:23.061 --> 39:24.393
(cell phones beep and chime)

39:24.393 --> 39:27.866
THAT WE ARE IN CONTROL.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.638
(cell phone chimes)

39:29.638 --> 39:31.900
"LONG LIVE DAVID CLARKE"?

39:31.900 --> 39:35.544
(crowd murmuring)

39:35.544 --> 39:37.406
(booms, screams)

39:37.406 --> 39:38.777
(booms)

39:38.777 --> 39:41.450
(people screaming)

39:41.450 --> 39:44.052
(panting)

39:44.052 --> 39:47.716
(car alarms blaring)

39:48.857 --> 39:51.890
(screaming continues)

40:02.531 --> 40:05.804
(pants) JACK.
