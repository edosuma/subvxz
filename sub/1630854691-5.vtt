Did Rowan want Carlotta
to die or did Lasher

49:32.360 --> 49:33.860
want to Carlotta to die?

49:34.060 --> 49:35.210
Is this Rowan's will or not?

49:35.410 --> 49:37.120
Lasher says he's showing her

49:37.320 --> 49:39.650
her true self through
this exercise.

49:39.850 --> 49:41.350
That is the game
they are playing.

♪

49:49.340 --> 49:51.180
Rowan opens the door
and walks outside,

49:51.380 --> 49:53.660
and in this shot
you see that, yes,

49:53.860 --> 49:55.970
she's free of the house,
but everything

49:56.170 --> 49:58.230
is completely upside down.

49:58.430 --> 50:01.670
She has slid into
this other world.

50:01.870 --> 50:04.590
What is the next episode like
I hope the audience will wonder.
