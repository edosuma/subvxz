WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.369
Okay. Found you.
Oh!

00:03.371 --> 00:04.870
I do have an open seat
in first class,

00:04.872 --> 00:06.705
If one of you would like
a free upgrade.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.540
No, thank you.
I think we'll sit together.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.275
After the amazing weekend
we just had...

00:10.277 --> 00:11.777
I'll take it.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.445
I deserved that seat.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.615
Three days in the woods with
Phil's ex-cheerleader buddies...

00:16.617 --> 00:19.651
The old stories,
the spontaneous human pyramids,

00:19.653 --> 00:22.221
Constantly updating
their tumbler tumblr...

00:22.223 --> 00:24.390
I smiled through
the whole thing.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.392
Problem is
I was so convincing,

00:26.394 --> 00:28.894
Phil thought I was having
a great time.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.796
What do I want?
Some credit.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.065
When do I want it?
Now.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.234
Hi.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.236
Hey.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.306
I'm sorry if I smell
like a Campfire.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.808
I've been in the woods
for three days.

00:42.810 --> 00:43.909
I hate Camping.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.711
If I'm ever
in the woods for three days,

00:45.713 --> 00:47.579
It means I've been dead
for two of them.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.749
Wow.

00:50.751 --> 00:51.984
It feels good
to laugh for real.

00:52.987 --> 00:55.187
You look like
you need a drink.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.589
Hon?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.491
Two chardonnays and a hot towel
for my friend.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.427
Right away.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.762
I love you,
beautiful stranger.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.099
I have to admit,
I was a little miffed

01:07.101 --> 01:08.734
That Claire grabbed
the good seat,

01:08.736 --> 01:10.235
Especially after I gave her
such a magical weekend,

01:10.237 --> 01:12.438
But I was determined
to stay positive.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.239
And then it hit me.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

¶¶¶

01:27.620 --> 01:29.054
Everybody, sal's here.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.122
- Okay. All right.
- Oh, oh.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.123
Is this straight?

01:31.125 --> 01:32.791
You're throwing
a baby shower

01:32.793 --> 01:34.526
With a dozen men
in tailored pants

01:34.528 --> 01:35.727
Sipping bellinis.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.863
Nothing about this is...
Ugh, I can't even finish.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.765
Really? The last word was
too much? So, we decided
to get the gang together

01:42.102 --> 01:44.570
To throw our friend sal
a belated baby shower.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.638
She's been a little
hard to pin down lately,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.474
But we knew she'd never
miss the chance

01:48.476 --> 01:50.442
To shower with a bunch
of men.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.444
You love that joke,
don't you?

01:52.446 --> 01:55.080
Well, because it's two different
kinds of showers.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.082
Mm-hmm.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.484
This is little sammy.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.153
This is as long

02:01.155 --> 02:02.387
As you've ever been in our house
without a cocktail.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.256
No, thank you.
Just a water, please.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.159
Okay, everybody,
drop your pearls.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.627
I'm still
breastfeeding.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.229
All the books say,
"do it at least a year."

02:10.231 --> 02:11.230
Jotham,
drink this.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.331
I can't.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.632
I'm leaving early
to go to a hockey game.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.733
Kings versus blackhawks.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.001
Wow.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.836
They can
call a team that?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.805
Black <i> hawks.</i>

02:19.807 --> 02:20.939
Oh.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.107
I've got to put this
in the kitchen.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.242
I make
all my own baby food.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.476
It's all-natural,
no chemicals.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.011
Uh, who is
this woman?

02:26.013 --> 02:28.113
She's not drinking,
she's making her own baby food.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.848
Does Lily have
any other plates?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.683
I don't let sammy eat
off this plastic.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.851
Uh, yeah,
the far cabinet.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.019
Mm-hmm.
Oh, thanks.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.087
Okay.
None of this makes sense.

02:35.089 --> 02:36.088
I know.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.589
How does
she breastfeed him

02:37.591 --> 02:39.258
If she doesn't let him
near plastic?

02:39.260 --> 02:41.260
Mom,
do I have a fever?

02:41.262 --> 02:43.729
Ay, let me check.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.999
You know,
we have a thermometer.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.334
Do you have to be so white
all the time?

02:49.336 --> 02:53.872
Oh, baby, go lay down.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.341
You're such a brave,
little boy!

02:56.343 --> 02:58.010
He's faking it.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.278
He's pretending
to be sick

02:59.280 --> 03:01.113
So he doesn't have to go
to his cooking class.

03:01.115 --> 03:02.781
He has to go.
Today's lasagna.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.950
I've been starving myself
all day for that.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.285
He doesn't want to go

03:06.287 --> 03:07.686
Because there's a boy there
that is picking on him.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.887
Cooking class?

03:08.889 --> 03:10.722
You know, we're running out
of places to send him

03:10.724 --> 03:11.790
Where he can be cool.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.725
I know.
Enough is enough.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.227
You have to teach him
how to fight.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.395
Yeah. That'll work.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.563
You're doing this.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.898
And don't tell him
that this is coming from me.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.201
It's bad for a boy to know that
his mother thinks he's weak.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.869
That's a lifetime
of paying women

03:23.871 --> 03:25.470
To spank him
until he cries.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.239
The kid is just not
a fighter.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.874
He gets squeamish
pounding veal.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.242
Just do it!

03:30.244 --> 03:32.311
Fine, but I'm only doing it
for the lasagna

03:32.313 --> 03:34.846
And the extra food he's been
bringing home on sundays.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.848
Makes mondays easier,
you know?

03:36.850 --> 03:39.084
Oh, my god,
you're the garfield.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.085
Hey.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.353
One of you
pretty ladies

03:41.355 --> 03:42.988
Want to take me
to meet a girl later?

03:42.990 --> 03:45.357
You think calling us pretty
is gonna get you a ride?

03:45.359 --> 03:46.358
I'll take it.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.526
Let me know
when you want to leave.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.728
Besides, I like rose.
I think she's good for you.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.663
This is a new girl...
Sarah.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.732
I'm done with rose.
She crazy.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.901
Easy, macklemore.
What do you mean, "crazy"?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.669
I'll tell you what he means.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.239
Any time a woman
challenges a man in any way,

04:00.241 --> 04:02.274
Suddenly, she's crazy.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.243
So, what did she do
that was so crazy, Luke...

04:04.245 --> 04:05.510
Give you her opinion?

04:05.512 --> 04:09.114
Yeah, or what, did she dare
to talk about her feelings?

04:09.116 --> 04:12.084
The words sound like you get it,
but your tone is throwing me.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.219
Just tell me you said something
nice when you broke up with her.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.721
I haven't broken up with her.

04:15.723 --> 04:16.454
What?!
What?!

04:16.457 --> 04:17.589
It just seems weird

04:17.591 --> 04:20.058
To call someone up
and give them bad news.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.459
She'll find out somehow.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.862
Ugh.
Ugh, when did you become
a guy? It's gross.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.897
You need to stand up
and face her.

04:25.899 --> 04:26.898
In person?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.700
What are we, 30?
Send her a text.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.935
You need to break it
to her gently.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.270
First,
tell her she's awesome.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.571
And pretty.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.806
If she was awesome and pretty,
I wouldn't be dumping her.

04:34.808 --> 04:35.907
Just do it, you pig.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.278
We all know
I'm not gonna do it,

04:39.280 --> 04:41.713
So if you want it done,
here.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.784
Oh, and don't go
looking around on there.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.220
It's not gonna make you
like me more.

04:48.222 --> 04:49.554
Ugh.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.098
'S-scuse me.
I think you're in my seat.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.000
Sir, we think
you're in her seat.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.670
No,
I'm definitely 16c.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.171
This is 19c.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.806
Oh, darn it,
that's three rows up.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.074
Sorry about that.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.809
That's all right.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.244
Hi. Welcome.

05:12.246 --> 05:13.512
Um, could you hang back
a second?

05:13.514 --> 05:14.479
I-I dropped my phone.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.749
I may have, uh,
what you're looking for...

05:17.751 --> 05:19.818
Right there.
Wait. What?

05:19.820 --> 05:20.919
Hi.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.421
I'm a professional
magician.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.423
Holy sword-box,
you're edward legrand.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.490
Yeah, I am.
I am.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.591
I-I'm Phil Dunphy,

05:26.593 --> 05:28.527
P-professional realtor,
amateur magician.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.995
Well,
nice to meet you.
Hi. I'm jillian.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.330
I've been told
I have magic hands.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.665
I'm a masseuse.
Oh.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.600
Why do you keep rubbing
your forearm like that?

05:35.602 --> 05:37.502
Oh, I-I had a suitcase
land on me.
Oh, let me see.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.871
I've got a great new trick
I want to show you.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.341
Oh!
Ooh,
I can do tricks, too.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.109
This spot's connected
to your tongue.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.844
Oh. Ohh!

05:46.880 --> 05:47.946
Can I stow your bag
for you?

05:47.948 --> 05:50.882
Mm.
No, we'll be needing this.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.784
Trashy magazines.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.219
Oh, you're the best.

05:54.221 --> 05:57.189
Ooh.
Caramel truffles.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.391
I even brought
an extra fluffy neck pillow.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.692
Oh!

06:00.694 --> 06:04.363
Oh, this must be
what a mother's hug feels like.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.901
Well, it looks like she's taking
good care of you.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.303
Well,
she is my best friend.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.637
Listen to me, julio.

06:12.639 --> 06:16.241
I want the gutters
cleaned today, not mañana.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.909
If everyone thought
my people were lazy,

06:17.911 --> 06:21.813
I would do whatever it took
to not seem lazy.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.915
Comprende?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.851
Actually,
we're gonna take off soon,

06:25.853 --> 06:27.252
So we're gonna need you
to turn off your phone.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.355
I'm actually not done talking,
and two more.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.656
Well, if I were you,

06:31.658 --> 06:34.760
I'd put down the burrito
and get up that ladder.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.263
What are you doing
standing there

06:38.265 --> 06:40.832
And not getting drinks for me
and my good friend, Claire?

06:40.834 --> 06:43.301
Actually, we just met.
Mm.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.238
Oh, guys, guys,

06:46.240 --> 06:48.907
I can't let you do the cleanup
all by yourselves.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.409
Ronaldo will help you.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.410
Of course!

06:51.412 --> 06:55.046
I need her keys to start
loading the gifts in her car.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.449
I think she's changing sammy
in our room.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.885
I hope she's also changing
those drapes.
Oh!

06:59.887 --> 07:02.020
I don't want to sound like
a sentimental softy,

07:02.022 --> 07:03.121
But does anyone miss

07:03.123 --> 07:04.923
The drunken whore
she used to be?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.525
Oh, I like the new sal.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.094
Turns out, all she needed to
bring out her maternal instinct

07:09.096 --> 07:10.195
Was a little baby.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.930
I don't buy it.
No, something's up.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.433
You do remember her suggesting
we chuck Lily into the ocean.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.468
Oh, Mitchell, calm down.
Babies change people.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.069
Like you used to be
a judgmental cynic,

07:18.071 --> 07:20.572
And then Lily...
Oh, wait.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.474
You guys,
sal's not back there.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.943
Sal?
The drapes still are.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.311
Well, that's weird.
Her car's gone.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.312
What?!

07:27.314 --> 07:28.547
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.749
In this neighborhood,
her car could have been stolen.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.551
Well, you know,
she did seem frazzled.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.085
May... maybe she forgot
to say goodbye.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.787
Oh, and forgot
all of her presents.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.492
And forgot her baby.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.461
You don't think that there's
any way that she would...

07:42.463 --> 07:43.462
N-no.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.596
I-I can't even say it.

07:44.598 --> 07:45.964
I can.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.999
That gin-soaked tart
abandoned the little bastard.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.501
Oh, st...

07:49.503 --> 07:51.603
What?
He's fatherless.

07:51.605 --> 07:54.072
Am I wrong?

07:57.777 --> 07:58.844
Okay, I've called sal
five times,

07:58.846 --> 08:00.078
And she still hasn't picked up.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.947
I knew this whole "earth mother"
thing was an act.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.649
Oh, maybe we should
use our happy voices

08:04.651 --> 08:06.084
When we're accusing a mommy

08:06.086 --> 08:07.819
Of abandoning her
little baby boy.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.956
Ugh.
This is a true disaster.
Isn't it?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.257
Someone put a spanish roof

08:12.259 --> 08:14.426
On what is clearly
a mid-century ranch.

08:14.428 --> 08:15.427
Oh, no.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.162
Someone just went
numero two.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.430
- Oh!
- Yeah.

08:18.432 --> 08:19.931
And the aftershocks
are still rolling in.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.501
Here's her diaper bag.
And... What's...

08:23.769 --> 08:25.437
Oh, no. This...
Uh, h-here's a note.

08:25.439 --> 08:26.972
"I'm sorry
to leave this way.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.139
"I'm not proud of it,

08:28.141 --> 08:29.674
"but I just can't do this
anymore.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.009
Goodbye. Sal."

08:31.011 --> 08:33.477
it's getting harder and harder

08:33.480 --> 08:35.280
To keep a positive spin
on this.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.017
Here. Have some cheese.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.553
Oh, no. Thank you.
I'm... I'm good.

08:41.554 --> 08:42.988
Oh, my.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.456
That is
strong.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.391
Oh, my goodness.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.960
Hey.
What are you staring at?

08:48.962 --> 08:51.062
It's french cheese.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.964
Costs more than you make
in a week.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.833
Okay, you might want
to keep your voice down.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.635
Claire.
Yeah?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.870
That guy over there
is checking you out!

08:58.872 --> 09:00.338
I don't think he is.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.308
My friend Claire would like
to meet you in the bathroom.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.044
No.
I-I did not say that.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.813
Claire, why do you do that
to yourself?

09:08.815 --> 09:11.182
You are so pretty.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.151
Hey, Phil,
what time is it?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.185
What's wrong?

09:14.187 --> 09:17.889
My watch is go...
Edward, what did you do?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.758
Jillian, what's your, uh,
middle initial?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.026
"C," for catherine.

09:21.028 --> 09:24.195
And, Phil, uh, what age were you
when you first kissed a girl?

09:24.197 --> 09:26.231
12 cousin,
14 non-cousin.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.199
Let's stick
with non-cousin.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.169
I think if you go to 14c,
seat right over there,

09:31.171 --> 09:33.838
You'll <i> wind up</i>
with what you're looking for.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.206
It works on battery,

09:35.208 --> 09:38.276
But, oh, my god,
I'm excited!

09:41.047 --> 09:42.047
Excuse me.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.248
Phil. It's me.
Oh, hey.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.583
What are you doing
back here?
I need a break

09:44.585 --> 09:45.917
From the woman
I'm sitting next to up there.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.253
She is the worst person
on earth.
I'm sorry.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.722
I was hoping she might be a
little less aggressive with you.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.257
Do you mind switching with me
for a little while?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.192
Oh, honey, you don't want to.
It's hell back here, too.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.860
I'm squished between
this fat lady

09:55.862 --> 09:57.562
Who keeps digging
into my elbow

09:57.564 --> 09:58.930
And this huge,
sweaty dude

09:58.932 --> 10:00.865
Who won't stop blabbing on
about his job.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.033
Oh.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.735
Well, could I get a hug?
I could really use one.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.037
Sure thing. Oops.
They want us back in our seats.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.739
I didn't hear
the little ding.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.740
Your ears
must be plugged.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.375
Whoa!
Did you feel that?

10:10.377 --> 10:11.943
No, I-I-I didn't
feel anything.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.312
This is scary.
You should go back.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.086
Amazing.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.921
Thank you.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.389
Sorcerer!

10:24.391 --> 10:26.291
Not bad.
I felt that one.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.126
So good, Manny.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.761
All right,
really let one go this time.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.796
Thinks about how mad
this guy makes you.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.264
What's his name?
Gideon.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.432
Oh, geez.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.134
All right,
think about what he did to you.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.370
I'd rather not
talk about it.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.272
I don't know why you're smiling.
Your fennel's burnt.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.575
Whereas I made
a perfect butternut squash.

10:43.577 --> 10:44.609
That's just butter.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.112
Oh, yeah, I-I totally forgot
the nut squash!

10:47.114 --> 10:49.080
Oh!

10:49.082 --> 10:50.982
Snap it.
Snap it. Good.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.751
More. Good.
I'm done.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.619
I'm not fighting anymore.
It's not worth it.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.087
But you're doing so good.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.256
You just have to turn
your shoulder first

10:58.258 --> 11:00.558
So that you can throw
your weight behind your punch.

11:01.594 --> 11:02.827
If you want.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.829
I already think
that you're very tough.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.765
This is all Jay's idea.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.600
All right. Come on, kid.
Show 'em who's boss.

11:08.602 --> 11:09.668
No.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.603
I'm more of a lover
than a fighter.

11:11.605 --> 11:13.438
Well,
that's the goal, anyway.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.941
Ay, okay, papi,
whatever you decide.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.877
Don't let him leave
this room!
Ow, ow, ow!

11:18.879 --> 11:21.179
Maybe <i> you</i> should teach him
how to hit.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.514
Oh, my god.
Check it out.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.716
Rose got your breakup text
and wrote back.

11:24.718 --> 11:25.717
She mad.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.519
What?
Give me that.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.456
"Thanks for the dumbest
breakup text ever.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.024
"Don't call a girl awesome,
then break up with her.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.293
"If I'm so great,
why'd you dump me?

11:35.295 --> 11:37.962
Get over yourself,
you insensitive troll"?

11:37.964 --> 11:41.132
What is her problem?
She can't talk to you like that.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.702
She's not.
She's talking to <i> you.</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:46.337
I can't believe
I ever liked this girl.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.373
Our text was compassionate
and respectful.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.175
There was nothing dumb
about it.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.676
A million percent.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.344
What are you doing?
Oh.

11:53.346 --> 11:57.849
This crazy bitch just messed
with the wrong crazy bitch.

11:57.851 --> 11:58.983
Whoo, whoo, whoo,
dee, doo!

11:58.985 --> 12:00.085
This is unreal.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.486
We always knew
sal was unstable,

12:01.488 --> 12:02.887
But how could she
do this?

12:02.889 --> 12:04.556
We don't know
that she's done anything.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.491
Okay, let's just suppose
for a second

12:06.493 --> 12:08.226
That she's on a plane
to cabo.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.427
What then?

12:09.429 --> 12:10.829
Maybe this is part of
a bigger plan.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.030
You know,
maybe the reason

12:12.032 --> 12:13.565
We didn't adopt
another baby after Lily

12:13.567 --> 12:16.668
Was because god wanted us
available for sammy.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.937
Who is this god
that denies us a baby,

12:18.939 --> 12:20.438
Then gets a party girl
pregnant,

12:20.440 --> 12:22.574
Only to have her desert the baby
so that we can finally get one?

12:22.576 --> 12:24.743
The same god
that impregnated a virgin,

12:24.745 --> 12:27.078
Sent moses down the river
in a basket,

12:27.080 --> 12:30.048
And commanded abraham
to stab his own son.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.417
God only does
weird baby stuff.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.920
There is part of me that would
love to keep this little guy

12:35.922 --> 12:38.022
And raise him the way
sal was pretending to.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.524
Exactly.
Lily could have a baby brother.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.092
But there are systems
in place here.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.361
You can't just keep him like
a bunny you found in the yard.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.263
That's crazy.
Aww.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.098
Listen,
we discussed it,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.067
And we think
we should take the kid.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.969
Ee!
What should we call him?

12:50.971 --> 12:53.037
Not sure,
but definitely not sammy.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.906
Sammy saltzman
sounds so silly.

12:57.743 --> 13:00.578
We can
overhand shuffle,

13:00.580 --> 13:02.947
And we can
riffle shuffle...

13:02.949 --> 13:04.082
but, you know,

13:04.084 --> 13:08.586
There is no escape
from the angry...

13:08.588 --> 13:09.754
Queen.
What?

13:09.756 --> 13:11.923
Phil.
What are you doing?

13:11.925 --> 13:14.592
Making the best
of a bad situation?

13:14.594 --> 13:15.927
Why is that woman
rubbing your shoulders?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.962
Oh, uh,
jillian is a masseuse,

13:17.964 --> 13:21.065
And this, of course,
is edward legrand.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.734
Pleasure
to meet you.

13:22.736 --> 13:24.636
Now, if you could just give me
my ace of spades back...

13:24.638 --> 13:28.573
This is why you had to race back
to your hellish seat...

13:28.575 --> 13:30.675
For back rubs
and card tricks?

13:30.677 --> 13:32.610
Do you have any idea what
I'm going through up there?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.245
She clipped her toenails

13:34.247 --> 13:36.781
Because her "oriental girl"
didn't do it right.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.650
Claire, I'm sorry.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.585
But I need you to check
your pocket.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.957
Insanity!

13:45.959 --> 13:48.593
Thank you very much.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.928
Don't be mad at me.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.496
You're the one
who grabbed that seat.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.831
That was
a pretty selfish move.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.265
Yeah,
I did grab that seat,

13:54.267 --> 13:56.334
Because I spent the entire
weekend being selfless,

13:56.336 --> 13:57.769
And you didn't even
thank me once.

13:57.771 --> 14:00.104
Why would I thank you for
giving you an awesome weekend?

14:00.106 --> 14:01.272
Awesome?

14:01.274 --> 14:03.675
You spent the whole weekend
rehashing stories

14:03.677 --> 14:06.311
About itchy, rusty,
and loveboat.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.679
How is that fun for me?!

14:07.681 --> 14:09.147
They were always
getting into stuff!

14:09.149 --> 14:10.615
I Came back here
for some compassion,

14:10.617 --> 14:12.650
And all you did was lie to me
and blow me off

14:12.652 --> 14:14.719
So you could keep
having your fun

14:14.721 --> 14:17.155
While I suffer up there
in first class!

14:17.157 --> 14:18.523
Oh, my heart goes out
to you.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.158
Oh, stick it, kreskin.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.494
I'm sitting next to
a cheese-eating racist.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.629
I'm sorry about your card.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.331
Yeah, uh...

14:26.333 --> 14:27.332
Don't be.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.633
Son of a...

14:28.635 --> 14:30.335
All right.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.636
I'll be back...
Pick you up at 6:00.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.204
Now, remember,
what did I teach you?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.173
Violence solves everything,

14:35.175 --> 14:37.041
And don't wind my fist up
like popeye.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.477
It's not violence.
It's self-defense.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.746
You cannot let this kid
keep pushing you around.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.681
Now, you walk in there
like a badass,

14:43.683 --> 14:46.551
And you make the best damn
lasagna anybody's ever seen.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.487
I appreciate the speech, Jay,
but I'll handle things my way.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.889
Kid, one more thing.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.224
Don't forget
the garlic bread.

14:54.193 --> 14:56.194
Because without that...
I-I get it.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.832
Hey, delgado.

15:00.834 --> 15:04.002
Manny, I'm talking to you.
You want a piece of this?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.673
Ow!
What was that for?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.341
Looks like I gave you
a piece of <i> this.</i>

15:10.343 --> 15:11.509
What the hell?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.011
I was just offering you
some apple crumble!

15:13.013 --> 15:14.579
What? You were not.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.582
Yes, I was!
I felt bad about teasing you.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.917
My therapist said

15:18.919 --> 15:19.751
I was acting out
because of my parents' divorce,

15:19.753 --> 15:21.552
So I was trying to be nice.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.722
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know!

15:24.724 --> 15:25.924
Good shot, kid!

15:25.926 --> 15:28.226
That'll teach you
who to pick on, you punk...

15:28.228 --> 15:29.360
Not my boy!

15:29.362 --> 15:30.929
He learned how to punch
from the best.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.263
His parents
are getting divorced,

15:32.265 --> 15:34.032
And he made me that dessert
as an apology.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.901
This whole thing
was your mother's idea.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.608
Ronaldo, you grab
the roller thingy, and, uh...

15:43.610 --> 15:46.778
Oh! I'll grab
that big mesh cage.

15:46.780 --> 15:47.779
All right.
Everybody, stop.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.914
You can't just keep
a baby

15:49.916 --> 15:52.750
Like it's some rabbit
you found in the yard.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.253
There are systems
in place.
Wow.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.255
He has to stay
somewhere tonight, no?

15:57.257 --> 15:58.923
Yeah,
how about right here,

15:58.925 --> 16:00.792
Because we know how
to raise a child?

16:00.794 --> 16:01.793
Oh, please.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.127
We'll dress him
and feed him,

16:03.129 --> 16:04.963
And conchetta can handle
the poopy stuff.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.131
I gave her obamacare.
It's the least she can do.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.800
We all want
what's best for the baby.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.903
Y-you're very nice people,
but we've done this before.
Mm-hmm.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.905
So?
It's our turn.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.674
I wanted a child
for some time now.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.276
My biological clock
is ticking.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.111
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.280
Is it? I'm 44.
Or <i> that</i> is.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.815
You are one mean lady.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.084
We're not leaving
without felipe.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.418
Well, then,
you're not leaving.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.153
Fine!

16:36.162 --> 16:38.997
Did we settle on
"felipe"?

16:45.938 --> 16:46.938
Phil.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.106
Honey,
what are you doing?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.707
One second.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.943
So, I have 20 fur coats
in my closet,

16:51.945 --> 16:54.145
But I'm the only one
of my friends

16:54.147 --> 16:56.014
Who even
wears them anymore,

16:56.016 --> 16:59.550
So you tell me
who's endangered.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.319
Jillian's waiting for you
in my seat

17:01.321 --> 17:02.987
To give you
a little back rub.

17:02.989 --> 17:06.324
You didn't have to be
so great this weekend.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.893
But you were,
so thank you.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.228
And I should have
said that earlier.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.729
Mwah!

17:11.731 --> 17:13.297
Go enjoy
the rest of your flight.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.298
I'll deal with this.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.067
"Deal with this"?

17:16.069 --> 17:19.069
I'm a state senator's
mistress.

17:19.071 --> 17:21.705
You're my hero.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.309
Wipe your feet
before you come in!

17:25.310 --> 17:26.676
Listen to that.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.413
First thing out of her mouth,
she's telling us what to do.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.514
Well,
that stops today.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.082
We go in strong.
We hold our ground.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.718
We let her know
she's done pushing us around.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.653
Manny,
why are you home so early?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.321
Did you let him
skip school?

17:37.323 --> 17:38.322
No, mom.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.390
I was kicked out

17:39.392 --> 17:41.359
For punching
a really misunderstood kid,

17:41.361 --> 17:42.393
Thanks to you.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.394
Thanks to me?
What, did...

17:43.396 --> 17:44.395
I told him everything.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.930
And you know
what we realized?

17:45.932 --> 17:49.000
There <i> is</i> a bully in our life,
and it's you.

17:49.002 --> 17:52.036
You make the rules,
you boss us around,

17:52.038 --> 17:54.338
And we're not gonna take it
anymore.
Mm. Yeah.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.074
Ah, look at you two,

17:56.076 --> 17:58.242
Standing up
to the big, scary bully

17:58.244 --> 18:00.578
That loves you
and protects you

18:00.580 --> 18:03.081
And wants you to be safe
in this world.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.919
You're just tiny, little men
to me right now,

18:07.921 --> 18:11.022
And you need to leave this house
and come back with more respect!

18:11.024 --> 18:12.156
And a pizza.

18:13.358 --> 18:14.592
Oh, what?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.594
You need to go first
and check on your mascara?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.196
We do need to eat.
Yeah.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.263
I wouldn't mind
some pizza.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.765
We're not getting
any pineapple.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.066
You are
getting pineapple!

18:22.068 --> 18:23.234
We're taking it off
our slices.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.735
Don't waste any food,
Jay!

18:24.737 --> 18:26.370
I think we made our point.
Totally.

18:26.372 --> 18:29.373
We'll get our own pizza...
Eat it in the car.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.611
Give me one reason

18:33.613 --> 18:36.380
Why sammy should stay here
tonight instead of with us.

18:36.382 --> 18:37.782
Because
we're experienced parents.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.250
We have a crib!

18:39.252 --> 18:42.086
We have a pediatrician.
Our house is babyproofed.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.255
Our house was in
<i>architectural digest.</i>

18:44.257 --> 18:45.590
Ronaldo, please,
you're not helping.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.924
They don't know
what that is.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.260
How can you even fit another
child in this shoe box?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.394
You're poor!

18:50.396 --> 18:52.096
We have a beautiful house
with a big yard

18:52.098 --> 18:54.132
Where he could throw the ball
with the gardener.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.433
Okay, look.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.135
If anybody's gonna adopt sammy,
it's gonna be us.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.136
Oh!

18:58.138 --> 18:59.470
Whoa!
Do I have any say in this?

18:59.472 --> 19:02.273
Sal!
Oh, well, you're back.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.075
What the hell
are you four doing?

19:04.077 --> 19:06.144
You walked out of here and left
your baby without saying a word,

19:06.146 --> 19:07.311
So maybe we'll be asking
the questions.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.313
I told john john
where I was going.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.414
The drunkest guy
at the party.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.649
Excuse me
for not wanting

19:11.651 --> 19:13.284
To interrupt
your fierce debate...

19:13.286 --> 19:15.953
"who's hotter, mr. Clean
or the brawny paper towel man?"

19:15.955 --> 19:17.255
Mr. Clean.
Brawny paper towel guy.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.489
We're not
going back there.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.291
That still doesn't explain
why you would leave

19:20.293 --> 19:21.959
In the middle
of your own baby shower.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.128
I got freaked out when jotham
mentioned the blackhawks.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.097
Every time.
I hear it every time.

19:26.099 --> 19:27.665
Sammy's dad is on the team,
okay?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.433
And he didn't know
sammy existed...

19:29.435 --> 19:31.802
At least not until I just went
down there and I told him.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.638
Oh, gosh. What happened?
How did he take it?

19:33.640 --> 19:35.306
It turns out
he's married.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.441
Yeah, I could have googled that.
So he's out.

19:37.443 --> 19:40.811
And you thought
I deserted my own baby?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.013
You did leave.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.047
And then what...
What's up with this note, huh?

19:43.049 --> 19:44.348
Look...
"I'm sorry to leave this way.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.783
I'm not proud of it,
but I just can't do this."

19:45.785 --> 19:46.984
This diaper bag

19:46.986 --> 19:50.121
Is just a recycled purse
from my single days!

19:50.123 --> 19:52.623
I got a lot of these notes
lying around for quick getaways.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.727
You guys don't think
that I can do this, do you?
No!

19:56.729 --> 19:58.529
We always thought
you could do it.
I certainly don't.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.530
We don't think
you <i> can't</i> do it.
Shut up!

19:59.532 --> 20:00.631
I don't think
I can do it, either!

20:00.633 --> 20:01.999
Oh, sal.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.069
I mean, it's just

20:05.071 --> 20:06.904
So hard.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.674
I feel so guilty that he doesn't
have a dad in the picture.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.009
I don't know. I'm trying
to do everything perfectly.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.044
It's exhausting.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.413
And I haven't had sex
in like a year.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.484
- Oh!
- Oh.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.920
This little dude...

20:22.922 --> 20:26.490
He's the one thing in my life
that I cannot mess up.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.828
I just wish I could
give him a dad.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.598
Well...
What about us?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.933
We could be
sammy's dad.
All of us.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.235
Yeah, sal,
we love you,

20:37.237 --> 20:38.603
And we're always here for you...
Whatever you need.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.239
Except we'll be in capri
all of July.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.540
Seriously, sal,

20:42.542 --> 20:45.009
You and sammy
will never be alone.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.544
You guys are so sweet.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.247
Wait.
June's no good, either.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.582
I'm getting my neck done.

20:56.521 --> 20:57.421
Oh, my god!
What did you do?!

20:57.423 --> 20:59.090
We stuck up for you.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.424
Yeah,
rose had it coming.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.026
She can't talk to you
the way we do.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.928
Well, rose forwarded
your text to sarah,

21:03.930 --> 21:06.197
And now sarah doesn't want
to go out with me.

21:06.199 --> 21:07.565
Give me that phone.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.900
What did this skank sarah
say to you?

21:09.902 --> 21:10.901
Huh.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.437
Mm, yeah. Ouch.
Good opening.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.040
That's so funny!
We totally deserved that.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.409
Totally!
Good sense of humor.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.077
Mm.
Oh, my god.
I love her.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.412
Me, too.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.947
Don't worry, Luke.
We're gonna win her back.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.415
We're just g...

21:24.417 --> 21:26.884
Luke?

21:26.886 --> 21:29.387
You think maybe
we need dates of our own?

21:29.389 --> 21:30.621
So bad.
