00:46.296 --> 00:47.297
Mike?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.225
Mike?

01:00.185 --> 01:01.561
[breathing heavily]

01:03.730 --> 01:06.733
Mike? Mike!

01:06.816 --> 01:08.735
[screaming] Mike!

Mike!

[panting]

04:01.574 --> 04:04.160
[Karen] What about the Russians?
What if they come looking for her?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.411
They don't know where she is.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.580
And she can't contact you
without us knowing.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.876
[man] The most important thing
is for you to try to go on with your lives

04:11.960 --> 04:15.088
- and to keep all of this...
- Top secret. Yeah.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.966
Understood.
We're all patriots in this house.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.095
- [woman] Go back to the beginning.
- [Mike] I told you everything.

04:22.178 --> 04:25.807
- I understand this is difficult, Michael.
- I don't know where she is.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.892
And even if I did, I'd never tell you.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.561
I would never tell you.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.855
[woman] I know it's difficult to accept,

04:32.939 --> 04:35.149
the stories she told you
were not true.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.652
She's a very dangerous individual.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.154
[man] If she contacts you,
you must tell us.

04:40.863 --> 04:45.493
[woman] Otherwise, you're putting yourself
and your entire family at risk.

04:45.576 --> 04:49.872
Do you understand, Michael?
Do you understand?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.041
[man] Michael?

04:53.501 --> 04:54.794
Michael?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.634
[man] Fan out.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.053
Somebody check the left side,
I'll check the right side.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.385
[Eleven] Ghost.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.512
Yeah, I see that.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.306
- [Eleven] Halloween.
- Sure is.

07:12.390 --> 07:16.269
But right now, it's breakfast, okay?
Come on, let's eat.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.603
They wouldn't see me.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.274
- Who wouldn't see you?
- The bad men.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.734
What are you talking about?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.612
Trick or treat.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.783
You want to go trick-or-treating?

07:34.579 --> 07:35.788
You know the rules.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.665
- Yes, but...
- Yeah, so you know the answer.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.460
- No, but they wouldn't see me.
- No. Hey. I don't care.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.920
- But they wouldn't see me.
- I don't care, all right?

07:43.004 --> 07:45.923
You go out there,
ghost or not, it's a risk.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.384
We don't take risks. All right?

07:49.260 --> 07:52.054
They're stupid, and...

07:52.138 --> 07:53.806
We're not stupid!

07:55.766 --> 07:56.767
Exactly.

07:57.977 --> 08:02.398
Now, you take that off, sit down and eat.
Your food's getting cold.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.371
[sighs] All right, look...

08:17.997 --> 08:23.377
How about I get off early tonight,
and I buy us a bunch of candy,

08:23.461 --> 08:27.423
and we can sit around and get fat,
and we watch a scary movie together?

08:28.049 --> 08:29.717
How's that for a compromise?

08:29.800 --> 08:32.010
[stutters] "Compromise"?

08:33.638 --> 08:37.725
C- O-M-promise. Compromise.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.562
How about that's your word
for the day? Yeah?

08:42.897 --> 08:46.108
It's something that's kinda in-between.
It's like halfway happy.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.654
By 5-1-5?

08:49.737 --> 08:53.241
5:15. Yeah, sure.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.368
Promise?

08:58.246 --> 08:59.330
Yes.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.707
I promise.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.128
Halfway happy.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.344
[chuckles]

09:23.771 --> 09:24.772
Will?

09:25.439 --> 09:26.983
Come on, honey, up and at 'em.

09:28.484 --> 09:29.652
Will?

09:29.735 --> 09:32.405
- Jonathan?
- Yeah?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.657
Where's Will?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.867
- What?
- Where's Will?

09:36.951 --> 09:38.452
- He's not in his room?
- No.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.954
Uh...

09:40.037 --> 09:41.205
Will?

09:42.623 --> 09:43.833
What are you doing?

09:44.917 --> 09:45.918
Peeing?

09:46.669 --> 09:47.920
[chuckles] Okay.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.422
[toilet flushes]

09:50.172 --> 09:51.173
Okay.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.136
- Let's get this... on.
- [grunts]

09:55.219 --> 09:56.095
Oh!

09:56.178 --> 09:57.888
You need some tape. Hold on.

10:11.485 --> 10:12.486
What's this?

10:15.698 --> 10:16.699
Nothing.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.328
Did you have another episode?

10:20.411 --> 10:23.414
No, it's just, um...
a sketch for a story I'm writing.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.376
[Joyce sighs] All right.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.297
[Jonathan] Three, two, one...

10:31.380 --> 10:33.758
- ["Ghostbusters" playing]
- Great. Hold up the proton blaster.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.053
All right, now turn to the light.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.433
Oh! I want to see those pearls. Yeah!

10:42.516 --> 10:43.893
- [meows]
- Who you gonna call?

10:43.976 --> 10:45.186
[scatting]

10:45.269 --> 10:47.063
[laughs] Oh!

10:48.230 --> 10:50.650
Adorable, baby. Just adorable!

10:52.193 --> 10:54.862
- God. You are such a nerd.
- Shut up.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.198
No wonder you only hang out with boys.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.909
- Erica!
- Just the facts.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.869
[mouthing] Nerd.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.121
[Mrs. Sinclair] My God,
I love this costume. Keep it up.

11:04.205 --> 11:08.292
- [Mike] All right, that's the last one.
- No, just one more. Come on, please?

11:09.669 --> 11:10.544
Ah!

11:10.628 --> 11:12.004
- Can I go to school?
- Wait, wait.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.923
- Okay, say, "Who you gonna call?"
- No!

11:14.006 --> 11:17.718
[all singing "Ghostbusters"]

11:20.596 --> 11:22.848
- ♪ Who you gonna call? ♪
- ♪ Ghostbusters! ♪

11:22.932 --> 11:24.058
Hey, Spengler!

11:24.141 --> 11:25.851
- Egon! Yeah!
- Venkman!

11:25.935 --> 11:26.811
Whoa! Whoa!

11:27.395 --> 11:28.938
- What?
- Why are you Venkman?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.898
- Because I'm Venkman.
- No, I'm Venkman.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.483
Why can't there be two Venkmans?

11:32.566 --> 11:35.986
Because there's only one Venkman
in real life. We planned this months ago.

11:36.070 --> 11:39.365
I'm Venkman, Dustin's Stantz,
you're Egon, and you're Winston.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.201
- I specifically didn't agree to Winston.
- Yes, you did!

11:42.284 --> 11:44.703
- I don't think he did.
- No one wants to be Winston, man.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.122
What's wrong with Winston?

11:46.205 --> 11:49.208
What's wrong with Winston?
He joined the team super late,

11:49.291 --> 11:51.335
he's not funny,
and he's not even a scientist!

11:51.419 --> 11:54.505
- Yeah, but he's still cool.
- If he's cool, then you be Winston.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.798
- I can't!
- Why not?

11:55.881 --> 11:59.301
- [stutters] Because...
- [mocking Mike] Because you're not black?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.178
- I didn't say that!
- You thought it.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.015
- I didn't say that!
- Mike!

12:05.099 --> 12:08.018
Guys... Guys! Guys!

12:11.272 --> 12:13.399
Why is no one else wearing costumes?

12:14.775 --> 12:15.943
[school bell ringing]

12:16.026 --> 12:16.986
Crap.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.864
- [students laughing]
- [student] Oh, my God!

12:19.947 --> 12:22.074
When do people make these decisions?

12:22.158 --> 12:23.993
[Will] Everyone dressed up last year.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.245
- It's a conspiracy, I'm telling you.
- Just be cool.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.622
[boy] Who you gonna call?
The nerds!

12:40.092 --> 12:43.262
- We gonna do this?
- Not right now. We look like morons.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.889
[Dustin] Maybe she likes Ghostbusters?

12:44.972 --> 12:47.516
Of course she likes Ghostbusters,
but that's not the point.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.060
The point is
we're dressed up and she isn't.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.896
[Dustin] I didn't bring
regular clothes. You?

12:51.979 --> 12:52.855
[Lucas] No.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.733
Then we have no choice.
We gotta do this. It's now or never.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.985
- Right. [sniffs]
- Let's engage.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.866
We could ask her after class.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.117
- Yup.
- Okay.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.415
[Joyce] See? It's an exact match.

13:15.794 --> 13:20.090
- But... why would he lie to me?
- [inhales deeply] He's a kid, Joyce.

13:20.174 --> 13:23.552
I mean, you heard him
describe these episodes.

13:23.636 --> 13:28.599
It's not like he's describing a nightmare.
He talks about them like they're real.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.976
Yeah, because they're not nightmares,
they're flashbacks.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.646
I know a couple guys
who have had these things,

13:33.729 --> 13:37.691
and it feels like you're there,
like it's happening.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.820
- Then what the hell is this?
- Owens said it would get worse.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.405
- That place...
- What do you wanna do?

13:43.489 --> 13:45.032
You wanna take him back to Chicago?

13:45.115 --> 13:48.118
Well, there's that guy in Boston
that's supposed to be...

13:48.202 --> 13:49.537
They're all a bunch of quacks.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.248
They'll all tell you the same thing,
just cost you more money.

13:53.415 --> 13:59.088
I think he's right... about trauma.
And we're coming up on a year, you know.

13:59.171 --> 14:03.968
I think everybody's on edge.
Me, you... Will most of all.

14:05.344 --> 14:08.430
I think we just gotta get through
the next few weeks.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.182
[sighs]

14:11.141 --> 14:12.226
[sighs]

14:12.309 --> 14:15.145
Nothing's gonna go back
to the way that it was.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.730
Not really.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.190
But it'll get better.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.360
In time.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.824
[sighs heavily]

14:26.907 --> 14:28.033
[Joyce mumbles]

14:28.117 --> 14:29.702
- Here.
- Thank you.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.539
- [chokes and coughs]
- [chuckles]

14:33.622 --> 14:35.916
Jesus! Hopper...

14:36.000 --> 14:38.043
Brings me back to old times.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.086
What?

14:39.169 --> 14:43.591
- [sighs] Sharing my cigarettes between...
- Fifth and sixth period.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.759
Yeah, under the steps.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.970
Mr. Cooper caught us that time, remember?

14:48.053 --> 14:50.472
He was like,
[gruffly] "Hey, assholes."

14:50.556 --> 14:53.392
We ran. We just ran.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.144
[chuckles]

15:06.405 --> 15:08.449
God, I want this to be over.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.409
I know.

15:13.078 --> 15:13.996

15:58.123 --> 16:00.209
How's it looking out there, cowboy?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.962
[man] Uh, you know, Doc. The usual.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.756
Nice and nasty
with a chance of radioactivity.

16:16.642 --> 16:21.188
Oh, yeah, it's barbecued all right.
Anyone hungry?

16:25.943 --> 16:26.944
[technician] And...

16:28.195 --> 16:29.655
[beeping]

16:29.738 --> 16:30.906
We're back on!

16:30.990 --> 16:33.242
[cheering and applauding]

16:35.661 --> 16:36.954
[Will] There was this storm.

16:37.037 --> 16:40.457
[Owens] Okay. So how did you feel
when you saw the storm?

16:40.541 --> 16:43.085
[Will] I felt frozen.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.422
[Owens] Actually frozen? Cold?

16:47.256 --> 16:51.844
[Will] No, like how you feel
when you're scared,

16:51.927 --> 16:55.014
and you can't breathe
or talk or do anything.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.142
I felt... I felt this evil...

17:21.749 --> 17:24.626
[Barbara echoing]
Nancy, this isn't you.

17:26.587 --> 17:31.008
[Nancy] Barb, just go ahead
and go home, okay?

17:32.760 --> 17:33.802
[Barbara] Nancy?

17:34.344 --> 17:35.345
Nancy!

17:37.264 --> 17:38.265
Nancy.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.101
What's going on? Are you okay?

17:46.857 --> 17:49.276
- I can't keep doing this.
- Doing what?

17:49.359 --> 17:52.696
- Pretending like everything's okay.
- What are you talking about?

17:53.572 --> 17:54.573
Barbara.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.742
It's like everyone forgot.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.620
It's like nobody cares.
Except her parents.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.622
- And now they're selling their house.
- Nance...

18:01.705 --> 18:04.792
And they're going to spend
the rest of their lives looking for her.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.335
- I know.
- It's destroying them.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.422
I know. Okay? I get it. But listen,
there's nothing we can do about it.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.133
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.930
- Well, you know that we can't do that.
- We don't have to tell them everything.

18:18.013 --> 18:21.725
This isn't some game, Nance.
If they found out that we told any...

18:27.397 --> 18:31.235
They could put us in jail. Okay?
Or worse, they could destroy our families.

18:31.985 --> 18:36.031
They could do anything they want.
Okay? Just think about what you're saying.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.285
Hey...

18:41.703 --> 18:43.413
Hey, hey...

18:45.374 --> 18:46.917
Hey, it's... [sighs]

18:48.710 --> 18:50.337
It's hard, but let's...

18:52.381 --> 18:55.175
let's just go to Tina's stupid party...

18:57.386 --> 18:58.762
wear our stupid costumes

18:58.846 --> 19:01.723
that we've been working on
for a stupid amount of time,

19:01.807 --> 19:05.978
and just pretend
like we're stupid teenagers, okay?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.857
Can we just do that, just for tonight?

19:13.026 --> 19:14.027
Okay.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.156
Come here.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.827
[Nancy sighs]

19:30.878 --> 19:32.296
[Dustin clears throat] Um...

19:32.963 --> 19:35.591
Hi, Max. I'm Dustin, and this is...

19:35.674 --> 19:37.259
- Lucas.
- Yeah, I know.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.427
The stalkers.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.763
[stutters] Uh, no. Actually...

19:41.847 --> 19:43.932
We weren't stalking you.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.853
No, we were just concerned because,
you know, you're new and all.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.313
Yeah, for your safety.

19:49.396 --> 19:52.232
Mmm-hmm.
There are a lot of bullies here.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.319
- [stuttering] So many bullies, it's crazy.
- Yeah.

19:55.402 --> 19:59.781
- Is that why you're wearing proton packs?
- Well, these don't function. But...

19:59.865 --> 20:04.912
I do have this
handy-dandy little trap here.

20:04.995 --> 20:08.332
And look, it even opens and closes.
Look, look, look...

20:09.374 --> 20:10.918
Voilà! [chuckles]

20:11.001 --> 20:12.127
It's cool, right?

20:12.753 --> 20:14.171
No? Okay. But, um...

20:14.254 --> 20:17.507
So, we were talking last night,
and you're new here,

20:17.591 --> 20:21.345
so you probably don't have any friends
to take you trick-or-treating,

20:21.428 --> 20:24.473
and you're scared of bullies,
so we were thinking

20:24.556 --> 20:26.767
that it would be okay if you come with us.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.019
- "It'd be okay"?
- Yeah. Our party's a democracy,

20:29.102 --> 20:30.437
the majority voted you could come.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.190
Didn't realize it was such an honor
to go trick-or-treating with you.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.192
We know where to get
the full-sized candy bars.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.610
We figured you'd want in.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.278
That's presumptuous of you.

20:40.113 --> 20:44.451
Yeah. Totally.
Uh, so, um... you'll come?

20:46.912 --> 20:50.666
We're meeting
at the Maple Street cul-de-sac at 7:00.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.167
That's 7:00 on the dot!

20:54.002 --> 20:55.879
"Presumptuous."

20:56.546 --> 20:57.798
That's a good thing, right?

20:59.424 --> 21:00.467
[sighs]

21:01.510 --> 21:02.511
Is it bad?

21:03.303 --> 21:07.891
Lucas, is it bad? Lucas?
Son of a bitch, Lucas. Is it bad?

21:10.227 --> 21:14.189
[woman on TV] How does it feel?
Like pouring pure silk onto my skin.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.025

21:20.988 --> 21:23.615
Well, I'm stunned.
I don't know what to think.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.784
- [man] Don't you love me?
- [Erica] Of course I love you.

21:25.867 --> 21:29.621
It's just that it's so sudden.
I mean, it's not like you.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.291
Erica, I am this way because of you.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.709
- [Erica] Me?
- "Me?"

21:33.792 --> 21:34.668
[man] Mmm-hmm.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.212
You have made me wild and impetuous,

21:37.296 --> 21:38.630
- just like you.
- "Impetuous."

21:38.714 --> 21:40.173
People are going to be aghast.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.051
- "People are going to be aghast."
- [man laughs] They're gonna love it.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.720
[both laughing on TV]

21:44.803 --> 21:48.390
I mean, it's gonna stun the whole town.
The whole world!

in this house, tonight...

23:41.503 --> 23:44.256
So, you're telling me that
Merrill poisoned your farm,

23:44.339 --> 23:47.092
because he thinks you poisoned his,
which, of course, you didn't?

23:47.175 --> 23:50.345
No, sir. And I got me an alibi
the night he accuses me.

23:50.428 --> 23:53.056
My Jenny and her boys were in town.
I was with them all night.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.977
- Did you actually see Merrill?
- No need. That man done lost his mind.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.771
Went around slandering me,
threatening all sorts of madness.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.273
- A pumpkin conspiracy.
- [chuckles]

24:01.356 --> 24:02.899
Hawkins' very own Chinatown.

24:02.983 --> 24:06.278
Merrill threatening to do something
and him actually doing something

24:06.361 --> 24:07.571
are two very different things.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.739
- You got a better explanation?
- Cold weather.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.867
- It's October.
- Yeah, it's a cold one.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.162
- You see these hands?
- Yeah.

24:15.245 --> 24:18.248
- You know why they look like that?
- Because you're old?

24:18.331 --> 24:20.792
- You're damn straight.
- [Powell chuckles]

24:20.876 --> 24:23.628
And I've been doing this
a long time, Chief. A long time.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.089
And I ain't never seen
anything the likes of this.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.800
- None of us have.
- None of us?

24:28.884 --> 24:32.179
Merrill didn't just hit me last night.
He hit damn near everyone.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.430
What are you talking about?

24:33.513 --> 24:38.226
Jack O'Dell, Pete Freeling,
Rick Neary, the Christensens.

You're late again.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.462
- Yeah, I had to get catch-up homework.
- Jesus. I don't care.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.547
You're late again,
and you're skating home.

- I don't see any cows.

- No.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.875
- Then why are you defending it?
- I'm not.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.168
Sure sounds like it.

You're right. We're stuck here.

Yours.

- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

- Did you say it's my fault?
- No.
