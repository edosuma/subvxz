WEBVTT

00:17.309 --> 00:18.477
"We need to talk"?

00:19.478 --> 00:21.188
It's never good.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.780
Dude. What the fuck, dude?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.581
Yes! There you go.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.043
Just concentrate. Yep. Have it ready.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.670
Yes! That's it! You got it!

00:45.337 --> 00:46.630
Love it.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.550
And again. Ready? Hit it here.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.760
Good. That's right. Bottom.

01:29.381 --> 01:33.427
"But that myself should
be the root and father of many kings."

02:49.711 --> 02:52.172
Excuse me? Can I help you?

04:00.449 --> 04:02.451
<i>How about you stop treating us
like charity cases</i>

04:02.451 --> 04:03.827
<i>and pay your damn taxes?</i>

04:04.453 --> 04:06.371
Once again,
I'm here with Adriana Washington,

04:06.371 --> 04:08.874
who's running for Congress
in New York's 13th district.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.419
Miss Washington,
everyone is up in arms over this clip

04:12.419 --> 04:15.422
from your commencement address
that they say is socialism.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.259
Yeah, well, I did quote Shel Silverstein
as well, but nobody's watching that.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.220
Of course not.
That would make you look human.

04:21.220 --> 04:26.391
Right. Ari, when I said those things,
I was young, I was idealistic.

04:27.518 --> 04:30.145
I watched a lot of <i>West Wing</i> as well

04:30.145 --> 04:33.190
and my understanding
of these issues was purely theoretical.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.691
But then you get out into the real world

04:34.691 --> 04:37.069
and you realize
that it's all much more complicated.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.948
And as you know, your grandmother
was a frequent guest on this show.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.282
I, like so many,

04:42.282 --> 04:43.909
hold her in such high regard,

04:43.909 --> 04:46.036
but we've uncovered
some troubling information

04:46.036 --> 04:50.624
that your grandmother paid you more
than the other aides in the office.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.085
I wanted to give you a chance to respond
to that accusation.

04:53.669 --> 04:55.128
Well, that's patently false.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.214
My grandmother did everything by the book.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.383
Well, apparently not everything.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.593
We actually have internal budgets

05:02.094 --> 05:06.557
showing that you were paid more
than every other staffer at your level.

05:26.702 --> 05:27.661
He ambushed you.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.288
I'm running in and out.

05:29.288 --> 05:32.416
Adriana, you are the best person
for the job.

05:33.041 --> 05:37.087
And even if the accusation is true,
your grandmother did it. Not you.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.215
- People won't hold you responsible.
- Well, apparently they are.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.092
- Have you looked at Twitter?
- Hey.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.142
Oat milk latte from Joe Coffee.

05:51.894 --> 05:55.147
Don't worry. I won't let the people know
you drink such elitist coffee.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.903
Natalie's waiting for me in the car.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.867
Right. Okay.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.745
Thank you for the coffee.

06:12.581 --> 06:13.582
Bye.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.043
Of course.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.682
Hey.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.944
So the principal called me.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.488
You cut out of school today?

06:46.448 --> 06:47.866
I guess.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.368
You guess?

06:51.411 --> 06:54.081
I went up to the music room,
and I was thinking about playing.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.542
I'm sorry I didn't ask you first.

06:57.626 --> 06:58.836
That's great.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.463
That's great
that you're thinking about playing music.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.174
Maybe we can see if we can get
your Uncle John to come set up the piano.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.551
He can't do it.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.469
It's a piano.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.888
I mean, it needs to be tuned

07:09.888 --> 07:12.057
and the soundboard needs to be repaired.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.768
- The movers destroyed it.
- Okay. I know.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.854
I'm gonna find somebody to fix it.

07:17.729 --> 07:18.730
May I be excused?

07:18.730 --> 07:20.858
You know,
I know it must be very hard for you

07:20.858 --> 07:22.734
that your uncle moved out so suddenly.

07:23.694 --> 07:24.778
Actually, I hardly knew him.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.864
Edward, you know that--
you know the rules.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.283
You can't eat food up in your room.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.826
- I know your rules.
- Edward?

07:30.826 --> 07:32.077
- Whatever.
- Edward!

07:32.077 --> 07:34.746
- What?
- You can eat wherever you want,

07:34.746 --> 07:39.042
but do not be rude to me
and treat me like I am invisible!

07:39.626 --> 07:42.921
I'm a person, you know? I'm a person.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.474
Eat your sandwich wherever you want.

08:51.240 --> 08:56.537
If this was a way of avoiding
sending out the wedding invitations,

08:57.246 --> 08:58.539
I approve.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.167
What came over you?

09:05.003 --> 09:06.255
What do you mean?

09:08.757 --> 09:09.967
That was just different.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.970
Not that I'm complaining.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.141
I guess I'm just getting excited
about the wedding.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.569
I love you.

09:30.696 --> 09:31.989
I love you too.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.465
What's that?

09:53.594 --> 09:54.595
Nothing.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.699
The owners did such a wonderful job,

10:15.699 --> 10:17.993
- as you can see.
- Oh, my God. It's perfect.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.411
Sweetie, you see the chandelier?

10:19.411 --> 10:22.206
- Amazing piece, isn't it?
- Does it come with the house?

10:22.206 --> 10:24.124
- I will ask the owner.
- Okay.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.501
Hi!

10:25.501 --> 10:27.503
Dee Dee, I didn't realize you were home.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.129
How are you?

10:29.129 --> 10:32.424
- I heard you asking about the chandelier.
- Yeah.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.718
It is Murano glass.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.346
My husband had it flown in from Italy.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.306
- It is beautiful.
- Yeah.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.933
- We love your home.
- Yeah.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.476
- Thank you so much.
- So, I--

10:42.476 --> 10:44.436
I guess you guys are deciding to downsize?

10:45.771 --> 10:48.774
We-- Yeah, we already downsized.

10:48.774 --> 10:49.983
My husband died.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.486
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.322
Yeah, remember that plane crash
back in March?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.032
You mean the one with the boy?

10:57.032 --> 10:58.325
That's the one, yeah.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.661
Charles was in seat 4C.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.954
Oh, Jesus.

11:01.954 --> 11:03.038
I'm so sorry.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.916
What a tragedy.
Dee Dee is such a brave woman.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.335
- Anyway--
- Hold on. Can I?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.254
How far along are you?

11:10.254 --> 11:13.674
- Five months. Yep.
- Oh, my God.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.717
Wait a minute. It's a girl.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.553
- Actually we don't want to know.
- No.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.137
I can tell it's a girl. You know what?

11:19.137 --> 11:22.516
I was pregnant with my Zoe
when we bought this house.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.560
- Circle of life.
- Yeah.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.520
- We should get going.
- I mean, she grew up here.

11:26.520 --> 11:30.023
We all grew up here, you know?
And it was-- We were a family.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.026
And then it all goes away.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.655
Anyway, enjoy.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.367
- There's a wonderful pool in the back.
- Go see the pool. Yeah, it's so good.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.119
- Thank you, Dee Dee.
- Thanks.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.178
This is becoming a habit.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.726
This was in that atlas.

12:06.393 --> 12:10.063
I'm pretty sure it's my grandmother's
soup dumpling recipe.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.316
Okay.

12:12.316 --> 12:13.942
Well, that's...

12:14.568 --> 12:18.572
that's what Brent brought to me
the night I kicked him out of my office.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.289
- Last time I ever saw him.
- Steve...

12:27.289 --> 12:31.418
I feel like my entire life
was a reaction to Brent.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.672
He was a fucking mess.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.551
I always had to be the good son.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.641
And after he died,

12:48.268 --> 12:52.314
I could feel my mother crumbling.

12:52.314 --> 12:55.692
Just... fucking crumbling.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.820
I couldn't watch it.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.078
So I proposed to Daphne.

13:14.545 --> 13:16.046
I can't stop thinking about you.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.923
Well, you need to, Steve.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.675
I know.

13:19.675 --> 13:21.760
You're confused and it's fucking me up.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.387
You can't come here anymore.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.182
Yeah. I know.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.852
- I'm not fucking around. I mean it.
- Okay.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.439
I'll see you at group.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.524
Uh-huh.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.581
I yelled at Edward.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.502
He was short with me,
and I snapped at him.

14:02.217 --> 14:05.888
Everything I'm doing is wrong.
He's a piano prodigy. You know that?

14:05.888 --> 14:08.599
He's like a concert pianist,

14:08.599 --> 14:13.228
but he won't touch his fucking piano
because I broke it.

14:13.228 --> 14:15.772
I hired the wrong movers,
and I broke his piano.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.524
I broke it. It's broken.

14:18.984 --> 14:19.985
I can't do it.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.074
And John left. My husband.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.911
My husband left me. He moved out.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.541
So there's that.

14:47.638 --> 14:48.639
Lacey.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.226
Lacey.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.229
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:55.229 --> 14:58.649
If you want, I can help you.
I mean, not with Edward.

14:58.649 --> 15:02.402
I don't know anything about being a mom,
but I can fix the piano.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.321
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.823
It's going
to be massively expensive though.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.952
Oh, my God. I'm just kidding.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.453
I'm just kidding.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.121
And I'll be happy to help.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.249
- Thank you.
- Of course.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.336
This thing has gone viral.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.463
I mean, I'm canceled.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.632
Dozens of people
and organizations are calling

15:23.632 --> 15:25.509
- for me to drop out of the race.
- And?

15:25.509 --> 15:26.593
What would you do?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.682
If someone questioned my love of God...

15:31.682 --> 15:33.892
- Yeah.
- ...and my service to my community,

15:33.892 --> 15:36.311
I would fight to the grave
to keep serving.

15:36.311 --> 15:37.646
Okay.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.815
Let's be honest.
This is New York politics.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.192
This scandal is only the tip
of the iceberg.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.819
If you win this race,

15:43.819 --> 15:46.780
you're going to be challenged
every single day until you retire.

15:47.364 --> 15:50.826
So, I can tell you what I hope you decide,

15:51.743 --> 15:54.204
I can tell you
how capable I think you are.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.375
I can tell you what a blessing
your service would be to this community.

15:59.877 --> 16:01.920
But I can't tell you
how much you want this,

16:02.880 --> 16:04.506
how much you're willing to risk.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.593
I can't tell you what's in your heart.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.012
Only you know that.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.396
- I'm glad you came to me.
- Yeah.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.077
- Eddie.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.331
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.667
Yeah. You said you needed to talk?

16:42.753 --> 16:43.962
Let's go inside.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.006
- You remember how to do it?
- Yeah.

16:46.507 --> 16:47.758
Yeah, I do.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.100
I'm glad I met you, Eddie.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.354
I'm glad I met you too.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.237
Sometimes I see him.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.490
I see him too.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.492
You do?

17:13.492 --> 17:14.576
Yeah.

17:16.537 --> 17:17.454
Do you talk to him?

17:18.163 --> 17:20.832
Yeah. A lot.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.837
He actually kind of won't shut up.

17:28.799 --> 17:29.842
You?

17:30.717 --> 17:31.718
No.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.682
When I see him,
he just kinda looks like he's praying.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.767
- Weird.
- Yeah.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.021
Well...

17:45.566 --> 17:46.900
at least we have each other.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.951
Eddie, I can't see you anymore.

17:57.119 --> 18:00.038
What? I won't touch you. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have touched your hand.

18:00.038 --> 18:04.793
No, it's not that.
That's what I had to tell you.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.921
You had me come all the way here

18:07.921 --> 18:09.798
just to tell me
you couldn't see me anymore?

18:10.591 --> 18:12.426
I had to say it to Jordan too.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.596
I can't see either of you anymore.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.849
I have to leave this behind now.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.518
Good luck, Eddie.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.770
No more texting, okay?

18:24.605 --> 18:27.232
Wait. I--

18:34.281 --> 18:37.784
Hey. Eddie.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.412
God, I told you.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.374
"We need to talk" is never good.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.720
Do I have to take a bath today?

18:56.720 --> 18:57.930
Yes, my niece.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.806
Can't we go to the park instead?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.308
No, my niece.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.228
- Why?
- You didn't take a bath yesterday.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.190
What if I take two baths tomorrow?

19:08.941 --> 19:11.109
- It doesn't work that way.
- Why not?

19:30.045 --> 19:31.255
Hey.

19:31.797 --> 19:33.257
- Hey, Adriana.
- Hi.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.889
- What is going on in here?
- How's Eric?

19:40.889 --> 19:42.474
How do you know I saw Eric?

19:42.474 --> 19:44.309
Because I live on this earth.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.019
Did you shut down all your apps?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.271
Actually, yes. What's going on?

19:53.735 --> 19:55.070
Oh, my God.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.614
Yeah, exactly.
You guys are the king and queen of Harlem.

19:57.614 --> 19:58.699
We are not dating.

19:58.699 --> 20:00.284
- Who cares?
- I care. And--

20:00.284 --> 20:01.535
- Kojo?
- No.

20:01.535 --> 20:03.412
- He's moving back to Ghana.
- Well, that's not the point.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.122
This is a lie,
and this is all over the Internet.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.666
First of all, it's good press,
which we desperately need.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.335
Second of all,
Eric is a fucking dreamboat.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.088
- Oh, my God.
- He polls favorably with all genders,

20:13.088 --> 20:15.716
all ethnicities,
all political affiliations.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.927
People will vote for you
if they think you're going home to him.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.596
So, first you wanted me to lie

20:20.596 --> 20:22.556
and say that I don't believe
in my graduation speech,

20:22.556 --> 20:24.892
and now you want me to lie
about having a boyfriend?

20:24.892 --> 20:27.811
We are not lying.
We're just not confirming.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.647
Adriana,
the election is less than a week away.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.524
Let people believe what they wanna believe

20:32.524 --> 20:34.443
- for one week.
- Oh, my God.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.738
This is fucked up.

20:38.447 --> 20:39.865
Child.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.996
They just redid the kitchen.
New appliances.

20:45.996 --> 20:48.165
You really can't beat it for the price.

20:51.793 --> 20:54.755
- Well, I'll let you two discuss.
- Right, thank you.

20:59.801 --> 21:02.930
Okay, if you don't like it,
there are others we can look at.

21:02.930 --> 21:06.725
I know it's a different scale
and a different lifestyle,

21:06.725 --> 21:10.771
but having financial security will lift
a huge weight off your shoulders.

21:10.771 --> 21:12.397
I'm gonna need to talk to Zoe.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.858
- Your daughter?
- Yeah, I haven't--

21:14.858 --> 21:16.527
I haven't told her any of this.

21:16.527 --> 21:20.697
Nothing about the money,
her father's "life in LA."

21:22.074 --> 21:23.617
I mean until I tell her

21:24.618 --> 21:26.286
nothing's ever gonna change.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.163
No, I think that's really smart.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.791
- It is smart. It is. Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:32.334 --> 21:35.170
It's really smart.
I need you to be there, of course.

21:36.547 --> 21:38.674
Wait, what are you talking about?

21:38.674 --> 21:40.217
- 'Cause of the financial stuff.
- But--

21:40.217 --> 21:41.718
I can't do that.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.470
I mean, that's what you do.

21:43.470 --> 21:48.016
Like, that's-- You're so impressive
when you talk about that stuff.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.393
She will listen to you.

21:49.393 --> 21:52.771
If I try to tell her about it,
she will just bulldoze right over me.

21:52.771 --> 21:55.440
No, this really feels
like a mother-daughter type thing.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.234
- You know? It's--
- We're doing better, you know?

21:57.234 --> 21:59.987
It's better between us,
but it's still like this--

21:59.987 --> 22:02.072
You know,
it's like the communication system

22:02.072 --> 22:03.907
is still very delicate.

22:03.907 --> 22:07.327
I feel like if you're there,
we'll behave like human beings.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.829
Okay,
this doesn't sound like a great plan.

22:08.829 --> 22:10.664
Let's do it tonight.
Can we do it together?

22:10.664 --> 22:13.041
I need to just do this.
Like, seven o'clock tonight.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.127
You come hungry, I will cook for you.

22:15.127 --> 22:17.796
- Healthy. I know how you eat healthy.
- Yeah. No, I don't--

22:17.796 --> 22:18.881
I appreciate this.

22:18.881 --> 22:21.383
Oh, my God. I don't know
what I would do without you, honestly.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.843
So, what do you think about the apartment?

22:23.427 --> 22:25.637
I would wrench my heart from my body
and bleed out

22:25.637 --> 22:27.723
before I would live there, but thank you.

22:28.473 --> 22:29.850
We're gonna think on it.

22:35.689 --> 22:37.024
Take a picture.

22:40.485 --> 22:41.612
Yay!

23:10.474 --> 23:12.226
Movers really fucked this thing up.

23:12.226 --> 23:13.352
Who are you?

23:15.395 --> 23:16.522
I'm Amanda.

23:16.522 --> 23:18.565
I'm a friend of your aunt's
from grief group.

23:20.651 --> 23:22.236
You lost somebody too?

23:22.819 --> 23:26.740
My fiancé, Brent. 19D.

23:28.534 --> 23:30.410
I don't remember him. I'm sorry.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.037
Don't worry. I wasn't gonna ask.

23:35.916 --> 23:37.459
This is a really nice piano.

23:38.710 --> 23:42.172
My brother used to say the only reason
to play an instrument was to get girls.

23:42.965 --> 23:44.883
That's as good a reason as any.

23:44.883 --> 23:48.720
The only girl I'm into
is my dead brother's girlfriend.

23:49.805 --> 23:54.101
Well, I'm crushing
on my dead fiancé's brother, so...

23:55.227 --> 23:57.646
- Really?
- Yeah. Don't tell anyone.

23:57.646 --> 23:58.981
No.

23:58.981 --> 24:00.566
This is a nice instrument.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.151
It was my dad's.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.115
- Was he your teacher?
- Yeah.

24:10.158 --> 24:14.413
When I was really little, he would play,
and I'd put my hands on top of his.

24:15.664 --> 24:17.124
Mostly Chopin.

24:17.916 --> 24:21.211
The first one was Nocturne 19 in E minor.

24:22.671 --> 24:25.382
But when I was around eight,
I got better than him,

24:25.382 --> 24:30.053
so my parents got me a real teacher.

24:33.724 --> 24:36.018
But it was never the same.

24:38.562 --> 24:40.647
Well, it's gonna be all fixed and tuned up

24:40.647 --> 24:42.357
just in case you ever wanna play it again.

24:45.277 --> 24:46.528
Choices, right?

24:47.571 --> 24:49.448
Yeah, choices.

24:50.991 --> 24:53.452
So, what are you going to do
about your dead fiancé's brother?

24:55.078 --> 24:58.415
Gonna ignore it. Move on with my life.

25:01.210 --> 25:02.211
Right.

25:04.171 --> 25:05.881
That's exactly what Mahira said.

25:08.675 --> 25:12.513
Even if you don't want to go out with him,
I mean, the dude still lost his brother.

25:15.224 --> 25:18.101
You know? Maybe cut him some slack.

28:14.528 --> 28:19.950
So I asked Steve to come to dinner
so that he could help explain

28:20.868 --> 28:25.747
some of the financial situation,
because it's a little complicated.

28:25.747 --> 28:26.957
So, you know...

28:27.499 --> 28:29.418
- Steve?
- Okay.

28:33.255 --> 28:34.756
For-- Well, for starters,

28:35.966 --> 28:40.053
your father purchased a condo
in Los Angeles which,

28:41.180 --> 28:44.266
unfortunately,
was purchased at the height of the market.

28:44.266 --> 28:48.061
Well, real estate
is the best investment you can make. So...

28:48.061 --> 28:49.646
Yeah, it often is,

28:50.147 --> 28:52.316
but not when you're unemployed
and in debt.

28:52.316 --> 28:55.903
We're not in debt.
And my father was not unemployed.

29:00.490 --> 29:01.617
Well...

29:03.202 --> 29:04.203
honey,

29:04.203 --> 29:08.332
he had lost his job.

29:08.916 --> 29:10.542
He left Leighton?

29:10.542 --> 29:13.462
I believe, technically, he was fired.

29:13.462 --> 29:15.964
He was number two in the company, Mom.

29:15.964 --> 29:17.049
I know.

29:17.049 --> 29:20.177
I mean, I don't know,
because I don't know the details either,

29:20.177 --> 29:22.471
you know? He didn't tell me.

29:22.471 --> 29:24.306
He didn't tell you. It's shocking.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.225
But I don't wanna dwell on that,

29:26.225 --> 29:28.519
because I really-- I wanna move forward...

29:28.519 --> 29:30.854
- You wanna move forward with Steve?
- ...into the future.

29:30.854 --> 29:33.398
Some rando from your grief group?
Is that who-- Really?

29:33.398 --> 29:35.692
- S-- No offense, I guess.
- No, it's okay.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.529
- But maybe I should leave you two alone.
- No, explain the numbers.

29:38.529 --> 29:40.197
- Explain the numbers, Steven. Thank you.
- Okay. Yeah.

29:40.197 --> 29:42.950
So your debt is approximately $3 million.

29:42.950 --> 29:46.036
But that number
will increase exponentially

29:46.036 --> 29:48.956
- if it isn't addressed immediately.
- What?

29:48.956 --> 29:50.832
But there's a plan.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.251
Explain the plan.

29:52.251 --> 29:54.086
You can get back to solvency,

29:54.086 --> 29:57.422
but it's going to take some sacrifices.

29:57.422 --> 30:00.425
Sacrifi-- What kind of sacrifices?

30:00.425 --> 30:03.720
First and foremost,
you'll need to sell the house.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.514
- What house?
- This house.

30:06.515 --> 30:10.310
Our house?
That's your plan? Sell our house?

30:10.310 --> 30:13.355
- Well, it's part of the plan.
- It's part of the plan? Okay.

30:13.355 --> 30:15.065
You'll also need to cut back on spending.

30:15.065 --> 30:16.608
Cut back how?

30:16.608 --> 30:18.235
On expenditures of all kinds.

30:18.235 --> 30:21.113
Clothing, food, travel, education.

30:23.156 --> 30:25.868
- Education?
- No. Definitely--

30:25.868 --> 30:28.120
- That has definitely not been decided.
- Wow.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.873
- He's talking about college?
- We're looking at financial aid. It's not...

30:30.873 --> 30:33.375
I mean, we can see
what you'd be qualified for but honestly,

30:33.375 --> 30:34.668
it's gonna be rather challenging.

30:34.668 --> 30:37.212
I'm just supposed to drop out of Barnard,
like, permanently?

30:37.212 --> 30:39.631
No, I'm recommending you transfer.
The CUNYs are great.

30:39.631 --> 30:42.217
- Brooklyn College, City College, Queens.
- Oh, my God. Do you know what?

30:42.217 --> 30:43.468
- It's all within budget.
- Fuck this.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.804
I am going on my trip
because I have plans too.

30:45.804 --> 30:48.098
- I have plans to travel.
- No. Nobody's going anywhere.

30:48.098 --> 30:49.474
Nobody's going anywhere.

30:49.474 --> 30:50.642
Fuck you, Steve!

30:50.642 --> 30:52.561
I told you Barnard was off the table.

30:53.353 --> 30:58.567
Honey, I don't wanna let your father's
financial mismanagement ruin your life.

30:58.567 --> 31:00.569
No, Mom. Don't put this on him.

31:00.569 --> 31:03.280
Dad loved us. He loved us.

31:03.280 --> 31:08.243
And maybe he spent too much,
but all of the extravagances were on us.

31:08.243 --> 31:12.414
Your fucking jewelry,
your shopping sprees,

31:12.414 --> 31:15.292
our lavish vacations that you arranged.

31:15.292 --> 31:17.961
He never did a single thing for himself.

31:19.463 --> 31:21.924
He never did a single thing for him--
That's funny.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.469
- Really?
- Yes, really.

31:25.469 --> 31:28.555
He was the fucking sane one,
and now I'm stuck with you!

31:28.555 --> 31:30.182
And fucking Steve!

31:30.182 --> 31:32.184
He was the sane one and I'm fucking crazy?

31:32.184 --> 31:34.102
- Yes, listen to you screaming!
- You know what, honey?

31:34.102 --> 31:37.773
You need to look at this.
Look at these piles and piles of--

31:37.773 --> 31:39.816
This is all bills.

31:39.816 --> 31:41.735
- Bills that we can't pay.
- Okay.

31:41.735 --> 31:44.988
And things that he's--
That your father spent money on.

31:44.988 --> 31:46.073
You are unhinged.

31:46.073 --> 31:48.283
- He spent $1.2 million--
- Shoving this shit in my face?

31:48.283 --> 31:49.284
- Look at it.
- That's enough.

31:49.284 --> 31:51.411
- You need to realize what your father--
- Ladies, that's enough.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.621
Oh, shit.

31:52.621 --> 31:53.830
- Oh, my God.
- Fucking hell.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.374
- Fuck!
- Steve, are you okay?

31:55.374 --> 31:56.917
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.545
Oh, my God. I have to go.

31:59.545 --> 32:00.879
Is it all right-- Is it broken?

32:00.879 --> 32:04.758
- Oh, my fucking God. Motherfuck--
- Zoe!

32:57.186 --> 32:59.771
Hey. Hi.

32:59.771 --> 33:04.651
Actually, I'm gonna use the bathroom
before we head out.

33:04.651 --> 33:05.819
Be right back.

33:06.528 --> 33:08.280
What are you doing out here?

33:08.280 --> 33:10.741
I came to pick up my paddleboard.

33:11.617 --> 33:13.410
Sorry. I should have called first.

33:13.410 --> 33:16.205
I just-- That was...

33:16.872 --> 33:19.291
Amanda from group.
She's here to tune the piano.

33:19.291 --> 33:21.251
Right. Is Edward playing again?

33:21.835 --> 33:23.670
- I don't know, John.
- Okay.

33:23.670 --> 33:28.175
You haven't been
on that board in five years?

33:28.800 --> 33:33.889
Yeah, I know. I just felt like maybe it's
a good time to start trying again.

33:37.893 --> 33:42.940
I got time
and feel like it could be meditative.

33:42.940 --> 33:44.900
- And, I don't think...
- I--

33:44.900 --> 33:47.653
...that a separation
is necessarily a bad thing.

33:47.653 --> 33:50.739
I think maybe sometimes it's like
an old car engine that breaks down

33:50.739 --> 33:53.367
and then to fix it,
you have to tear the whole thing apart.

33:53.367 --> 33:57.329
So you're saying our marriage
is like an old car engine?

33:57.329 --> 33:59.581
- That's not what I meant, Lacey.
- Then what are you saying?

33:59.581 --> 34:01.750
I don't wanna give up on us.

34:06.505 --> 34:09.382
You left me, John.

34:12.094 --> 34:16.139
You left me.

34:17.683 --> 34:18.934
I know.

34:24.606 --> 34:27.234
I haven't seen that board in years.
I think I threw it out.

34:29.402 --> 34:30.654
Yeah, okay.

34:34.283 --> 34:35.742
So I'll see you, Lace.

34:52.592 --> 34:53.635
You okay?

34:56.597 --> 34:59.391
I'm not okay. No.

35:10.194 --> 35:12.487
- It's Auntie Adriana! Uncle, look!
- <i>Once again, we are live</i>

35:12.487 --> 35:14.907
<i>in the campaign office
and it looks like the press conference</i>

35:14.907 --> 35:17.659
- <i>will begin momentarily.</i>
- It's dinnertime. We will watch TV later.

35:17.659 --> 35:20.037
- No way. We have to watch.
- <i>Earlier this week, we confirmed</i>

35:20.037 --> 35:22.998
<i>that my grandmother overpaid me
when I worked for her.</i>

35:22.998 --> 35:25.417
<i>Overpaid me with your tax dollars.</i>

35:27.127 --> 35:30.631
It's hard to find out that
someone you idolize did something wrong,

35:30.631 --> 35:32.633
especially when they're no longer with us.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.843
I'll never know what was going
through her head.

35:34.843 --> 35:38.138
I can't tell her that I'm mad,
that I wish she wouldn't have done it.

35:38.972 --> 35:41.642
But what I can do
is try to make things right.

35:42.935 --> 35:47.105
I am going to publish my tax returns
from the years spent working

35:47.105 --> 35:50.317
in my grandmother's office,
and I'm going to donate the overage

35:50.317 --> 35:51.735
to local charities.

35:51.735 --> 35:54.988
It is not a perfect solution,
but it's a start.

35:56.365 --> 35:58.283
I think we have time for a few questions.

35:58.283 --> 35:59.993
- Adriana.
- Ian.

35:59.993 --> 36:02.746
How long have you
and Eric Turner been back together?

36:04.456 --> 36:06.208
That's not what I came to discuss today.

36:06.208 --> 36:09.878
- But you have dated in the past, correct?
- I don't see how that is relevant.

36:09.878 --> 36:12.881
Can we stay on topic, please? Zina, yes?

36:12.881 --> 36:15.342
What is your response
to people calling you and Eric

36:15.342 --> 36:17.094
the king and queen of New York?

36:18.929 --> 36:21.014
Zina, I have respect for you
and your newspaper,

36:22.724 --> 36:24.726
but is this seriously
what you wanna ask me?

36:24.726 --> 36:26.895
How about my plans
to address gun violence,

36:28.105 --> 36:30.649
homelessness and climate change?

36:30.649 --> 36:31.817
Or better yet,

36:31.817 --> 36:35.195
I just confirmed that my grandmother
did something highly unethical.

36:35.195 --> 36:37.990
Where are your questions about that?
I am the candidate.

36:38.824 --> 36:41.034
I believe in free public college,

36:41.034 --> 36:44.204
rent control, wealth tax,
health care for all,

36:44.746 --> 36:47.541
and I want
to solve the homelessness crisis.

36:47.541 --> 36:50.252
Whether I am elected or not,
I will not rest

36:50.252 --> 36:53.422
until everyone sleeping on the street
has a roof over their head.

36:55.424 --> 36:57.134
I'm not a good politician.

36:58.135 --> 37:01.805
I'm not slick
or good at playing the game, clearly.

37:03.599 --> 37:07.895
But I will work hard for those
who have been disenfranchised,

37:07.895 --> 37:10.564
because those are the people
that need it the most.

37:11.690 --> 37:15.027
And I'm sorry if that offends
a certain tax bracket.

37:17.029 --> 37:21.366
But if you don't like what I stand for,
don't vote for me.

39:05.596 --> 39:09.057
- Hey.
- <i>Hey. How was your day?</i>

39:12.060 --> 39:14.563
I met Dee Dee's daughter.

39:16.148 --> 39:17.524
I met Miracle Boy.

39:18.192 --> 39:20.444
You win. You go first.

39:23.614 --> 39:25.657
Well, he plays Chopin.

39:25.657 --> 39:27.117
Chopin?

39:27.701 --> 39:30.787
So, he's a miracle and a genius?

39:38.128 --> 39:39.338
Hi.

39:40.005 --> 39:42.841
- Successful press conference.
- Thanks.

39:44.134 --> 39:45.552
So you are back with the minister?

39:46.553 --> 39:48.931
We got lunch.
I wanted his advice, that's all.

39:48.931 --> 39:51.642
Adriana, you don't need to spin it for me.

39:51.642 --> 39:53.393
I'm not a reporter.

39:53.393 --> 39:56.146
This is ridiculous. Why do I feel guilty?

39:56.146 --> 39:59.525
You're the one prioritizing your business
over our relationship.

39:59.525 --> 40:02.152
You knew I was going back to Ghana
when we got involved.

40:02.152 --> 40:06.073
Yes, but I thought it might change things.

40:06.865 --> 40:09.117
Your idea of a relationship
is me following you to Ghana.

40:09.117 --> 40:11.662
- It's so backward.
- It's not just my business.

40:11.662 --> 40:14.289
It's my family, my home.

40:14.289 --> 40:17.835
What about my business?
My family? My home?

40:19.628 --> 40:21.505
Look, I don't wanna argue.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.423
You need to be there.

40:25.926 --> 40:27.636
And I need to be here.

40:30.973 --> 40:33.100
And it's sad, but that's what it is.

40:39.815 --> 40:42.359
Okay.

40:43.986 --> 40:47.698
My grandmother infected me
with a fierce need

40:47.698 --> 40:51.034
to find my own purpose in this world.
Blaze my own trail.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.748
There are sacrifices
that come with that life.

40:56.748 --> 40:58.375
Especially for a woman.

40:59.626 --> 41:03.964
She died an 82-year-old single woman
with a massive chip on her shoulder,

41:03.964 --> 41:05.674
but she put me on this path.

41:06.675 --> 41:08.218
And I have to follow it.

41:12.306 --> 41:14.391
I'm sorry that the picture got out.

41:16.518 --> 41:18.437
I'm sorry that it hurt you.

41:19.980 --> 41:22.524
Eric and I aren't together.
I'm not his queen.

41:26.278 --> 41:28.238
But I'm not yours either.

41:36.747 --> 41:37.789
I understand.

41:37.789 --> 41:39.541
Kojo, I...

43:37.701 --> 43:38.911
Oh, my God!

43:38.911 --> 43:40.746
We're gonna have
to call the fire department.

43:42.331 --> 43:43.332
Sam?

43:43.999 --> 43:45.250
These pancakes are so burnt.

43:45.250 --> 43:47.628
Now, why are the first ones
always a disaster?

43:47.628 --> 43:49.630
Just give them to me.
I love burnt pancakes.

43:51.423 --> 43:52.466
Is everything okay?

43:53.008 --> 43:54.968
You've been really jittery all morning.

43:54.968 --> 43:56.303
Yeah, everything's great.

43:57.429 --> 43:58.430
Okay.

43:58.972 --> 44:01.016
Mommy, my shoes disappeared.

44:01.016 --> 44:02.434
And so it begins.

44:02.434 --> 44:03.727
I'll go get her.

44:03.727 --> 44:05.687
Geenie bean, where did you leave 'em?

45:32.816 --> 45:35.736
Hello?

45:35.736 --> 45:37.988
<i>Dee Dee, you sitting down?</i>

45:37.988 --> 45:39.615
<i>That couple's making an offer.</i>

45:41.116 --> 45:42.409
That was fast.

45:43.118 --> 45:45.329
<i>I know you said you weren't sure,
but they really want it.</i>

45:45.329 --> 45:48.582
<i>If we counter aggressively,
I think we can get them well above asking.</i>

46:09.394 --> 46:10.646
Where you going?

46:14.608 --> 46:16.652
Stop squeezing me, Mommy.

46:16.652 --> 46:19.071
I will never stop squeezing you,
my Zoeskies.

46:19.071 --> 46:21.573
- I love you so much.
- I love you, Mommy.

46:22.658 --> 46:23.659
I got you.

46:42.803 --> 46:44.388
<i>Dee Dee, you there?</i>

46:48.684 --> 46:52.229
- Uh-huh. I'm here, yeah.
- <i>So?</i>

46:52.813 --> 46:54.731
I'll need a 60-day escrow.

46:56.733 --> 46:58.777
And the chandelier's coming with me.

48:09.598 --> 48:11.934
Hey. That was you, wasn't it?

48:12.935 --> 48:13.936
The putting green?

48:14.937 --> 48:15.979
Yeah.

48:15.979 --> 48:19.483
Well, actually,
Trent at Home Depot cut the PVC pipe,

48:19.483 --> 48:21.151
but, yeah, I did the rest.

48:26.031 --> 48:27.699
I'm sorry what I said about your dad.

48:29.785 --> 48:31.453
I'm really sorry, okay?

48:31.453 --> 48:35.457
Edward, I'm changing.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.126
Things are changing.

48:42.506 --> 48:44.049
You can't sleep over anymore.

48:44.049 --> 48:47.678
Why? Like, ever?

48:47.678 --> 48:50.222
I can't have a boy sleeping
in my room anymore.

48:50.222 --> 48:51.515
Why not?

48:51.515 --> 48:53.225
Do I really have to spell this out
for you?

48:53.225 --> 48:55.060
Well, if you like me, what's the problem?

48:56.478 --> 48:57.604
I'm a woman now.

48:59.898 --> 49:00.941
What were you before?

49:03.443 --> 49:04.778
I got my period.

49:05.988 --> 49:09.408
I don't care about that stuff. It's fine.

49:09.408 --> 49:11.326
That's--
This is just the way the world works.

49:11.326 --> 49:12.703
It's not personal.

49:15.455 --> 49:16.582
Here's all your stuff.

49:27.551 --> 49:29.136
Are we not friends anymore?

49:31.180 --> 49:32.639
We can hang out sometimes.

49:34.099 --> 49:35.517
It's gonna be okay. It's...

49:36.059 --> 49:39.855
No, it's not gonna be okay.

49:41.481 --> 49:42.941
It's not gonna be okay for me.

49:42.941 --> 49:44.443
You'll make new friends.

50:07.466 --> 50:12.513
..."double toil and trouble.
Fire burn and cauldron bubble."
