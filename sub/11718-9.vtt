00:42.859 --> 00:45.099

Responding units be advised
I am now on foot.

01:28.543 --> 01:31.111
Responding units, the handling
unit is now on foot.

01:31.179 --> 01:33.180
Any responding unit
not on the containment,

01:33.248 --> 01:35.082
meet the handling unit
at the east gate

01:35.149 --> 01:37.217
for a grid search assignment.

01:42.523 --> 01:44.857
Spread out.
He has to be here somewhere.

01:45.759 --> 01:47.360
Sarge!

01:47.428 --> 01:48.896
Sarge, I got tire tracks!

01:51.200 --> 01:53.001
He must have ditched the car
in one of these containers.

01:53.068 --> 01:54.269
Let's get 'em open.

02:15.226 --> 02:16.893
This is the car.

02:20.731 --> 02:22.065
No sign of the driver.

02:22.133 --> 02:23.566
Sarge, over here!

02:23.634 --> 02:24.667
What you got?

02:24.735 --> 02:26.269
Blood.

02:28.505 --> 02:29.472

Have you ever
thought about investing in gold?

03:16.454 --> 03:18.922
Are you a financial planner
with clients interested in gold?

03:18.990 --> 03:20.124
Maybe you'd considered gold,

03:20.191 --> 03:22.326
but the commissions
were just too high.

03:22.393 --> 03:24.928
I'm convinced
the market's gonna crash.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.197
With the U.S. dollar falling
and inflation rising,

03:27.265 --> 03:30.001
I've already converted
considerable amounts

03:30.068 --> 03:31.503
of my assets into gold.

03:31.570 --> 03:34.072
I remember the '70s

03:54.761 --> 03:58.497
I was watching that.

03:58.564 --> 04:00.399
Through the blanket?

04:02.602 --> 04:04.870
Oh, well, I was
listening anyway.

04:04.938 --> 04:08.441
Yeah, I mean, because there's
nothing more soothing

04:08.509 --> 04:10.009
than the sound
of somebody trying

04:10.077 --> 04:11.344
to sell you gold coins, right?

04:11.412 --> 04:12.780
You know, I need something

04:12.847 --> 04:14.548
to block out the sound
of the ocean

04:14.616 --> 04:16.017
'cause the waves keep crashing

04:16.084 --> 04:19.488
over and over and
over again, Steven.

04:19.555 --> 04:22.491
Some would say
it's a relaxing sound, Danny.

04:22.559 --> 04:24.293
Yeah? Some people would.

04:24.361 --> 04:25.762
And other people, like myself,
would say

04:25.829 --> 04:27.230
it's Hawaiian water torture,
okay?

04:27.298 --> 04:28.998
Two weeks now,
I can't take it anymore.

04:29.066 --> 04:33.169
Okay, you know I don't mind
you crashing with me

04:33.237 --> 04:34.671
till you find your own place,
right?

04:34.738 --> 04:35.905
I appreciate that.

04:35.973 --> 04:37.740
Okay, but I can't sleep
with the TV on.

04:37.808 --> 04:39.009
I can't sleep with the TV off.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.744
And we discussed that
before you moved in.

04:41.812 --> 04:43.980
Yeah, we did.
I think I remember

04:44.048 --> 04:46.884
that it's McGarrett
house rule number 32:

04:46.951 --> 04:49.887
No TV after midnight.

04:49.955 --> 04:52.123
I'm sorry the hotel didn't
working out for you.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.925
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

04:53.993 --> 04:56.061
The hotel didn't "not work out,"
okay?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.496
It became infested
with black mold.

04:57.564 --> 04:59.365
There's a difference.
That's a sign from God.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.000
But...

05:01.068 --> 05:04.270
I have become accustomed
to doing things a certain way.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.538
Yeah, I know, and your way,
your way is completely insane.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.807
It's nuts. Who can take a shower
in under three minutes?

05:08.875 --> 05:10.575
Have you ever heard
of a navy shower,

05:10.643 --> 05:13.578
Danny? A navy shower?
No. Where do you think

05:13.645 --> 05:15.146
I would have heard
of something like a navy shower?

05:15.147 --> 05:15.747
I'm not in the navy.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.578
Three minutes is a luxury
in a navy shower, Danny!

05:23.188 --> 05:25.990
McGarrett.

05:26.058 --> 05:28.492
On the way.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.860
Put your pants on.

05:29.928 --> 05:31.562
We're going to work.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.705
Wow.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.408
Who's the mummy?

05:42.476 --> 05:43.910
How's it coming, Max?

05:43.977 --> 05:47.113
Well, based
on my preliminary examination,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.580
it appears that
the cause of death

05:48.648 --> 05:50.215
was a single gunshot
wound to the chest.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.917
There was
no exit wound,

05:51.985 --> 05:53.785
so I will be able to
recover the bullet

05:53.853 --> 05:55.120
and send it
to Ballistics.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.989
No wallet was found
on the victim, though,

05:57.056 --> 05:58.824
so I'm attempting to...

05:58.892 --> 06:02.395
Oh, hello,
gentlemen.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.629
How nice of you to arrive.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.001
Max, you o... you okay,
something wrong?

06:09.068 --> 06:10.869
As I was saying,
I'm attempting

06:10.937 --> 06:12.070
to get his fingerprints,

06:12.138 --> 06:13.872
but it seems that all
of his fingerprints

06:13.940 --> 06:15.674
have been
sanded off,

06:15.742 --> 06:17.777
so we will have to find
another way to identify him.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.245
Interesting, 'cause

06:19.313 --> 06:20.479
even when fingerprints
are sanded down,

06:20.547 --> 06:21.914
you know, they grow back
in a few weeks,

06:21.982 --> 06:23.750
so to keep 'em filed down
to that level takes

06:23.818 --> 06:25.419
a lot of time and effort.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.987
Maybe our killer didn't want
this guy identified.

06:27.055 --> 06:28.889
Yeah, I mean, if he's sanding
down his fingerprints,

06:28.957 --> 06:30.491
just imagine what he
did to our vic's face.

06:30.559 --> 06:32.093
Somebody went
to a lot of trouble

06:32.160 --> 06:33.427
to hide this guy's identity.

06:33.495 --> 06:35.029
why?

06:48.576 --> 06:49.618
Kono and I have been looking

06:49.619 --> 06:51.186
into the muscle cars
found at the shipyard

06:51.254 --> 06:52.854
to see if our vic's connected
to them somehow.

06:52.922 --> 06:55.056
Let me guess-- they're
not headed to any dealership.

06:55.124 --> 06:56.758
Nope, VIN plates

06:56.825 --> 06:58.926
were popped off or filed down,
and the containers were tagged

06:58.994 --> 07:00.862
to ship to China
and Japan.

07:00.930 --> 07:02.444
Yeah, big market over there
for American muscle cars.

07:02.469 --> 07:03.231
Yeah.

07:03.232 --> 07:05.533
Victim may have pissed off
the car thieves.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.002
Maybe, but why leave the body
in the trunk

07:08.070 --> 07:09.403
of one of their stolen cars?

07:09.471 --> 07:10.805
Maybe they were going
to dump the body

07:10.872 --> 07:11.906
when the ship was at sea.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.074
HPD has the cars.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.276
We can head
over there.

07:15.343 --> 07:16.511
Maybe we can collect
some evidence.

07:16.578 --> 07:18.580
We find the car thieves,
we might find the killer.

07:18.648 --> 07:21.049
Right now I'd settle
for an ID on our vic.

07:29.227 --> 07:31.228
Max.

07:33.031 --> 07:35.899
Max.

07:41.272 --> 07:43.273
Max.

07:45.142 --> 07:47.443
Ah, good to see
you, Agent Weston.

07:47.511 --> 07:49.311
Good to see you, Max.

07:49.379 --> 07:50.646
He's ignoring us.

07:50.713 --> 07:51.980
Um,

07:52.048 --> 07:53.982
you said on the phone you,
you got something for us?

07:54.050 --> 07:56.819
Yes, I was able to recover
a nine-millimeter bullet

07:56.887 --> 07:58.621
from our victim's
thoracic cavity

07:58.689 --> 07:59.823
and send it over
to Ballistics.

07:59.890 --> 08:03.528
Okay, were they, uh,
able to find a match?

08:06.866 --> 08:08.967
Yeah, did they get a match,

08:09.035 --> 08:10.836
Max?
Unfortunately,

08:10.904 --> 08:13.405
the search for a match
proved unsuccessful.

08:13.473 --> 08:14.773
However, I did
find something

08:14.841 --> 08:16.575
very interesting
after I was able

08:16.643 --> 08:17.943
to remove the
victim's bandages.

08:18.011 --> 08:19.611
- Hmm.
- Please follow me.

08:19.679 --> 08:21.413
Great.

08:21.481 --> 08:23.783
Behold.

08:24.551 --> 08:26.452
Note the sutures

08:26.520 --> 08:28.754
under the eyes
and the chin.

08:28.822 --> 08:31.291
Those would be consistent
with recent implantations.

08:31.358 --> 08:32.892
What kind of implantations?

08:33.928 --> 08:35.260
You mean plastic
surgery or...?

08:35.328 --> 08:38.265
Recently, since the sutures
haven't been removed.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.501
Judging by the onset
of rigor,

08:40.568 --> 08:43.037
the work was probably done
around time of death.

08:43.104 --> 08:46.541
Also note the numerous
surgical scars.

08:46.608 --> 08:48.610
This man had work done
on his cheeks,

08:48.678 --> 08:50.011
his nose,
and his brows.

08:50.079 --> 08:51.847
His appearance
was severely altered.

08:51.915 --> 08:53.449
Well, maybe it wasn't the killer

08:53.517 --> 08:55.217
who didn't want
this guy identified.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.551
Maybe it was the vic himself.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.953
Right.

08:58.021 --> 08:59.455
Great, so we have
no way to identify him?

08:59.523 --> 09:01.457
That's not entirely true.

09:01.524 --> 09:03.359
Any implant that goes
in a human body

09:03.426 --> 09:04.593
is marked
with a serial number.

09:04.661 --> 09:05.861
I can trace

09:05.929 --> 09:08.397
that serial number back to
the clinic that purchased them

09:08.464 --> 09:09.531
and then use
that information

09:09.599 --> 09:10.999
to obtain an ID.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.000
Of course, I'm still

09:12.068 --> 09:13.135
in the middle
of a full investigation,

09:13.202 --> 09:16.038
so once I know more,
I will let you know.

09:16.105 --> 09:17.539
Great.

09:17.607 --> 09:18.540
Thanks, Max.

09:18.608 --> 09:20.142
Thanks, Max.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.510
You're welcome,
Agent Weston.

09:21.578 --> 09:23.912
Anything to help
a friend.

09:29.953 --> 09:31.887
What did you
do to him?

09:31.955 --> 09:34.523
I'm sorry, what,
what did <i>I</i> do? Why me?

09:34.591 --> 09:36.792
Well, he's obviously
upset about something.

09:36.860 --> 09:38.994
- Boys...
- Evidently you automatically assume it's me.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.896
- That's ridiculous.
- Well, I-I know it wasn't me.

09:40.964 --> 09:42.543
You offend more people
than I offend.

09:42.544 --> 09:43.295
I don't think
that's true at all.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.567
- Guys.
- Yes.

09:44.635 --> 09:46.369
I'm gonna have to
give you a time-out.

09:46.437 --> 09:47.537
Let's get out of here.

09:47.604 --> 09:49.239
We got a murderer
to catch.

09:52.943 --> 09:55.678
'69 Camaro Z28.

09:55.746 --> 09:57.747
Ah, the thieves
had good taste.

09:57.815 --> 09:59.482
Hey, didn't Uncle Keako
have one of these?

09:59.550 --> 10:00.517
Mm-hmm.

10:00.584 --> 10:02.352
Man, I loved that ride.

10:02.419 --> 10:03.453
That rusted out old thing?

10:03.520 --> 10:04.954
Mm-hmm.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.523
I couldn't believe it when he
let me take it to the prom.

10:06.591 --> 10:09.193
Okay, I do not want to hear
about your prom night.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.629
Actually wasn't as glamorous
as you might think.

10:11.696 --> 10:13.631
I, uh, I ran out of gas

10:13.699 --> 10:15.533
and had to walk five
miles for a refill.

10:16.769 --> 10:17.936
Smooth, cuz.

10:18.004 --> 10:20.272
Find anything?

10:20.340 --> 10:22.541
Nothing-- no prints,
no tool marks.

10:22.609 --> 10:24.577
These guys were pros.
You?

10:24.645 --> 10:26.580
Uh, yeah, come take a look.

10:26.647 --> 10:27.814
Now, all the cars

10:27.882 --> 10:30.217
match descriptions
of recently stolen vehicles,

10:30.285 --> 10:32.619
except for the one
we found the victim in.

10:32.687 --> 10:34.455
So you're thinking
it wasn't stolen?

10:34.522 --> 10:37.124
I don't know, maybe the car
belonged to the vic.

10:37.191 --> 10:39.025
That makes sense.

10:39.093 --> 10:41.160
He could have gotten
jacked, fought back.

10:41.228 --> 10:42.395
Only why leave the body?

10:42.463 --> 10:44.630
Huh.

10:44.698 --> 10:46.365
All right, what do we
have in terms of leads?

10:46.433 --> 10:49.235
All right, well, one thing
these cars all have in common

10:49.302 --> 10:50.836
is new parts.

10:50.904 --> 10:53.405
Okay, so either
they've all been

10:53.473 --> 10:54.773
recently restored...

10:54.841 --> 10:56.942
Huge coincidence.
...or

10:57.010 --> 10:58.277
the car thieves
had the work done

10:58.345 --> 10:59.745
to make it harder
for us to track them.

10:59.813 --> 11:01.981
But it could be a way
to track our killers.

11:02.049 --> 11:04.318
Let's go find out
who pimped these rides.

11:04.385 --> 11:06.186
- All right.
- Eh?

11:27.675 --> 11:28.942
Howzit?

11:29.010 --> 11:30.677
For you, pretty lady.

11:30.745 --> 11:31.711
That'll be a hundred bucks.

11:31.779 --> 11:34.448
$100 for an
air freshener?

11:34.515 --> 11:36.049
No, no.

11:36.117 --> 11:37.651
For your information.

11:37.718 --> 11:38.985
What I pay, you pay.

11:39.053 --> 11:40.687
And the air
freshener?

11:40.755 --> 11:42.890
Threw that in for free.

11:42.957 --> 11:45.326
Uh... thanks, I guess.

11:45.394 --> 11:46.628
All right,
what you got?

11:46.695 --> 11:48.563
Aren't you going
to hang that up?

11:49.599 --> 11:51.033
Oh. Yeah.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.968
Uh, thanks, Kamekona.

11:53.036 --> 11:56.905
I always wanted an air freshener
that smells like...

11:56.972 --> 11:58.473
Spam Musubi?

11:58.541 --> 12:00.708
Yeah.

12:00.776 --> 12:03.410
They call that fragrance line
Aromas of Hawaii.

12:03.478 --> 12:05.679
I got Loco Moco for myself.

12:07.048 --> 12:08.548
Mmm.

12:08.616 --> 12:10.350
- Uh, brah...
- Oh, yeah.

12:10.418 --> 12:12.219
The manager does not know

12:12.286 --> 12:14.854
of any '69 Camaros
getting boosted,

12:14.922 --> 12:17.358
but he know one bruddah
where you can get one.

12:17.425 --> 12:19.427
This bruddah have a name?
Ken Nakoa.

12:19.494 --> 12:22.363
Word is, all
you got to do

12:22.431 --> 12:25.300
is get a shopping list
of the wheels you need,

12:25.367 --> 12:26.935
few days later...

12:27.002 --> 12:28.704
He delivers your groceries.

12:28.771 --> 12:29.872
Not mine.

12:29.939 --> 12:31.373
I wouldn't partake

12:31.441 --> 12:33.542
in such a morally
questionable arrangement.

12:33.610 --> 12:34.877
Others...

12:34.945 --> 12:36.578
don't have my strength
of character.

12:36.646 --> 12:38.313
Of course.

12:39.682 --> 12:42.317
Make sure that Ken Nakoa
gets this ASAP.

12:42.385 --> 12:43.785
"1966 Ford Mustang."

12:43.853 --> 12:45.319
What's this?

12:45.387 --> 12:47.288
It's our shopping list.

12:48.924 --> 12:50.758
Shoots.

12:50.826 --> 12:52.860
Thanks for the Spam.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.501
It's Max.

13:01.569 --> 13:03.337
Just be nice.

13:05.006 --> 13:07.674
Hi, Max.

13:07.742 --> 13:08.842
I was successfully able

13:08.910 --> 13:10.510
to remove the implants
from the victim

13:10.577 --> 13:12.645
and trace the serial numbers
back to a manufacturer.

13:12.713 --> 13:13.980
All right.
That's really great.

13:14.048 --> 13:15.482
Do they know
who the buyer was?

13:15.550 --> 13:17.952
The manufacturer confirmed
they sent the implants

13:18.019 --> 13:20.721
to Pukana la Clinic,
run by Dr. Thomas James.

13:20.789 --> 13:22.256
He's known to do excellent work.

13:22.324 --> 13:24.692
Uh, great.
That's great.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.594
Excellent work.
Thank you very much.

13:26.662 --> 13:28.063
Great work.

13:28.130 --> 13:30.032
Say, Max, uh,

13:30.099 --> 13:31.734
is it possible that
you're upset with us--

13:31.801 --> 13:33.536
perhaps Danny--
for some reason?

13:36.839 --> 13:38.306
Did he just hang up on us?

13:38.374 --> 13:39.908
I think he did. Max?

13:39.975 --> 13:41.442
Yeah.

13:41.510 --> 13:43.177
Definitely something you did.

13:52.085 --> 13:54.587
You know this
guy, Doc?

13:54.654 --> 13:56.789
Yeah, his name was Ryan Jackson.

13:56.857 --> 13:58.491
I did the work on him myself
about two days ago.

13:58.559 --> 13:59.659
What happened?

13:59.727 --> 14:00.926
That's what we're
trying to find out.

14:00.994 --> 14:02.695
Right, so anything
you can tell us

14:02.763 --> 14:04.964
would be a... be a great help.
- Of course.

14:05.032 --> 14:07.066
Jackson wasn't
our normal patient.

14:07.134 --> 14:08.801
I can tell you that.

14:08.869 --> 14:11.771
Okay, well, in the world
of elective surgery,

14:11.838 --> 14:13.506
what defines normal, Doc?

14:13.573 --> 14:15.474
The amount of work,
for starters.

14:15.542 --> 14:18.110
Normally, people come in here
for small jobs--

14:18.178 --> 14:20.145
liposuction, Botox,
maybe a face-lift.

14:20.213 --> 14:21.380
But not, uh...

14:21.447 --> 14:22.948
not Jackson?
No.

14:23.016 --> 14:25.550
Jackson came in
specifically asking

14:25.618 --> 14:26.885
for complete
facial reconstruction.

14:26.952 --> 14:30.288
I recommended rhinoplasty,
a brow lift,

14:30.356 --> 14:32.390
insertion of cheek implants,
the works.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.358
You didn't think
it was a little suspicious?

14:34.426 --> 14:36.761
I mean, what if this guy
was a murderer,

14:36.829 --> 14:38.263
child molester,
I don't know?

14:39.298 --> 14:40.999
That's not my job.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.167
That's not your job?

14:42.235 --> 14:43.835
No, you just, uh,
cash the check.

14:43.903 --> 14:46.138
Um, we're gonna need
to see his file,

14:46.206 --> 14:48.074
uh, payment information,
if that's all right.

14:48.142 --> 14:49.442
- No, of course.
- Great.

14:49.510 --> 14:51.979
I mean, I can get you
the file, but

14:52.046 --> 14:53.547
there's not gonna be
any payment information.

14:53.614 --> 14:54.714
Jackson paid in cash.

14:54.782 --> 14:55.982
I'm sorry. Cash?

14:56.050 --> 14:57.985
It's not uncommon.

14:58.052 --> 14:59.820
These procedures
are elective surgeries,

14:59.888 --> 15:02.523
which aren't covered
by insurance.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.460
Here's the file.

15:06.527 --> 15:07.661
All right, thank you.

15:07.728 --> 15:09.162
Look, anything else
you can remember

15:09.230 --> 15:11.031
about Ryan Jackson?

15:11.098 --> 15:13.133
Um, only that he left
in a hurry.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.301
I wanted him to stay
overnight after the procedure,

15:15.369 --> 15:18.438
but when I went to recovery
to check on him, he was gone.

15:18.506 --> 15:20.841
Look at this.

15:20.909 --> 15:22.009
Hmm.

15:22.076 --> 15:23.477
There's something
about this address.

15:23.545 --> 15:24.879
Numbers don't
look right.

15:24.947 --> 15:26.848
What do you mean?

15:26.916 --> 15:29.418
Yeah, it's just as I thought.

15:29.486 --> 15:31.020
The numbers are too high.

15:31.087 --> 15:32.421
This address right here--

15:32.489 --> 15:34.090
it'd put us in the
middle of the ocean.

15:34.157 --> 15:35.858
Well, that's not good.

15:35.926 --> 15:38.394
Also, what, no photos? Pre-op,

15:38.462 --> 15:40.296
post-op photos?
Normally, we take them,

15:40.364 --> 15:42.799
but Jackson asked
that none <i>be</i> taken.

15:42.867 --> 15:43.800
Claimed it was
a privacy issue.

15:43.867 --> 15:45.702
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

15:45.769 --> 15:47.203
Your Spidey-senses tingling?
What's going on?

15:47.271 --> 15:49.638
Did Jackson fill out
his paperwork right here?

15:49.706 --> 15:51.007
Yeah, of course.

15:51.074 --> 15:52.609
All of our clients fill out
their intake information

15:52.676 --> 15:54.110
here in the lobby.

15:54.178 --> 15:55.345
Cosmetic dentistry?

15:55.412 --> 15:57.380
So, there's something wrong
with my teeth?

15:57.448 --> 15:58.615
Flip it over.

15:58.682 --> 16:01.317
"Dr. Ryan Jackson, DDS."

16:01.385 --> 16:02.719
Coincidence.

16:02.786 --> 16:04.621
His name is also Ryan Jackson.

16:04.689 --> 16:06.056
Our victim

16:06.123 --> 16:07.791
didn't even use his real name.
- Pretty slick.

17:12.189 --> 17:13.923
One foot in front

17:13.991 --> 17:15.191
I still think

17:15.259 --> 17:17.527
Kono would have looked
way hotter in this outfit.

17:17.595 --> 17:19.429
Sorry, sistah.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.631
I did my time undercover,

17:21.699 --> 17:24.134
Keep an eye out for Nakoa.

17:24.202 --> 17:25.368
Yeah, this place
is a known hangout

17:25.435 --> 17:26.569
for local muscle
car owners,

17:26.637 --> 17:27.804
and it's right in the middle

17:27.872 --> 17:29.005
of the neighborhood
where Nakoa works,

17:29.073 --> 17:30.406
so, he should be by pretty soon.

17:30.474 --> 17:32.175
Okay. Got it.

17:44.222 --> 17:46.257
Hey, got him.

17:46.325 --> 17:48.326
Headed my way.

17:51.197 --> 17:53.598
Love to get a look
under the hood.

17:53.666 --> 17:56.735
How often do you use that line?

18:00.239 --> 18:02.073
Nice. Wouldn't
have thought

18:02.141 --> 18:03.408
you were into whips
by looking at you.

18:03.476 --> 18:05.910
Oh, there's a lot of stuff

18:05.978 --> 18:07.712

Phew! Moves fast.

18:20.459 --> 18:22.527
I like to move fast.

20:04.087 --> 20:05.844
you and your friends
tried your car grab scheme

20:05.845 --> 20:07.212
on this guy, and it went bad.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.881
All right,
then you stashed

20:09.949 --> 20:12.617
the body in the trunk
of one of the cars you stole.

20:12.685 --> 20:14.986

King Tut before in my life.

How about this,
Nakoa, all right?

20:21.827 --> 20:24.162
We saw the shopping list,
yeah? You steal cars.

20:24.230 --> 20:26.532
You stole that car, there was
a dead guy in the trunk, so,

20:26.599 --> 20:29.068
you talk to us, or you're going
to be talking to a cellmate

20:29.136 --> 20:30.870

20:30.938 --> 20:32.939

this works?

to be true.

20:38.547 --> 20:40.582

20:40.649 --> 20:43.384
We saw that baby on
the side of Ala Moana,

20:43.452 --> 20:46.254
keys still in the ignition,
pristine condition,

20:46.322 --> 20:48.356
just begging to get taken.

20:48.424 --> 20:50.058
The whole thing felt weird.

20:50.126 --> 20:51.360
You're lying.

20:51.427 --> 20:52.894
I swear on my kids.

20:52.962 --> 20:55.364
We took it to the docks
and put it with the others.

20:55.431 --> 20:57.065
Why didn't you check the trunk?

20:57.133 --> 20:59.268
It was a rush job. Didn't even
get a chance to paint it.

20:59.336 --> 21:00.402
Cleared out
the inside

21:00.470 --> 21:01.603
and stashed it.

21:02.639 --> 21:04.807
It's a classic.

21:04.874 --> 21:06.909
Figured someone would be asking
for one eventually.

21:06.977 --> 21:09.212
Find anything
inside the car?

21:09.280 --> 21:11.882
Only thing I found was a duffel
bag on the passenger seat.

21:11.949 --> 21:13.717
Where is the bag now?

21:15.753 --> 21:18.622
Nakoa's story checks out.

21:18.689 --> 21:20.523
TOD has our vic dead
before the car was stolen.

21:20.591 --> 21:22.659
Well, at least we still got
Nakoa on grand theft auto.

21:22.726 --> 21:23.860
- Right?
- Right.

21:23.927 --> 21:25.794
What do you got, Kono?
Anything interesting?

21:25.895 --> 21:28.564
Yeah, I got three shirts,
three pairs of shorts,

21:28.631 --> 21:30.032
socks and three pairs of boxers.

21:30.099 --> 21:31.366
All right.

21:31.434 --> 21:32.500
Well, now
we know our victim

21:32.568 --> 21:34.202
preferred boxers to briefs,
but still no ID.

21:34.269 --> 21:35.369
That's not all.

21:35.437 --> 21:36.971
I found this
in a side pocket.

21:46.783 --> 21:49.251
It goes to room 235
of the Kalihi Motel.

21:49.319 --> 21:51.254
I already reached out
to the manager,

21:51.322 --> 21:53.956
and the renter's name
is Adam Raines.

21:54.024 --> 21:55.091
Could be our victim's real name.

21:55.159 --> 21:57.260
Yeah. Or our killer.

21:57.895 --> 21:59.128
Good work.

22:10.874 --> 22:12.241
Nice place.

22:12.309 --> 22:15.144
Yeah. Wonder if it comes
with black mold.

22:16.245 --> 22:17.646
Funny.

22:17.714 --> 22:18.747
Too soon?

22:18.815 --> 22:20.316
Little bit.
Okay.

22:24.153 --> 22:25.654
Hey, hey.
No, it's okay.

22:25.722 --> 22:28.191
We're Five-O.
We're Five-O.

22:28.258 --> 22:30.993
It's okay.

22:31.061 --> 22:32.194
What's your name?

22:32.262 --> 22:34.930
Suzie Greene.

22:34.998 --> 22:36.399
Where's Adam?

22:37.434 --> 22:39.635
Adam Raines?
Yeah.

22:39.702 --> 22:41.203
How do you know Adam?

22:41.271 --> 22:43.005
He's my boyfriend.

22:43.073 --> 22:44.840
Is he in some sort of trouble?

22:44.908 --> 22:46.876
He was supposed
to be back by now.

22:46.944 --> 22:49.212
Suzie, do you know
if Adam has had

22:49.279 --> 22:50.713
any plastic surgery recently?

22:50.781 --> 22:52.882
Yes. Why?

22:55.052 --> 22:57.453
What?

22:57.521 --> 23:00.455
Has something happened to Adam?

23:00.523 --> 23:02.023
Yeah.

23:05.595 --> 23:07.396
He loved that car.

23:09.432 --> 23:12.200
Restored it himself;
that's how we met.

23:14.037 --> 23:15.904
He started coming
into the shop,

23:15.972 --> 23:18.975
I worked in the
pick up parts.

23:19.042 --> 23:20.476
After we started
dating, he said

23:20.544 --> 23:23.746
he used to return stuff
just as an excuse to see me.

23:23.813 --> 23:26.715
How long were
you guys together?

23:26.783 --> 23:29.050
A year and a half.

23:29.118 --> 23:31.886
He moved in with me
about a year ago,

23:31.954 --> 23:33.221
but...

23:33.288 --> 23:35.256
we-we hadn't seen each other

23:35.324 --> 23:36.323
much lately.

23:36.391 --> 23:37.758
Why is that?

23:37.826 --> 23:40.327
He worked on a cable ship...

23:40.395 --> 23:43.965
laying underwater electric cable
across the Pacific.

23:45.301 --> 23:46.934
He'd be gone a month,

23:47.002 --> 23:49.637
home a week.

23:49.705 --> 23:53.341
We tried to make it work
the best we could.

23:53.409 --> 23:55.243
But then, uh...

23:55.311 --> 23:56.945
What? Did something happen?

23:57.012 --> 23:59.581
About a week ago, he...

23:59.649 --> 24:02.285
called me,
left me this strange message.

24:03.554 --> 24:06.256
Do you still have the message?
Can we hear it?

24:07.425 --> 24:08.459
Thanks.

24:08.526 --> 24:09.593
Suzie, it's me.

24:09.661 --> 24:11.228
I... I made a big mistake.

24:11.296 --> 24:12.897
We have to move
as soon as possible.

24:12.964 --> 24:14.098
Someone out here...

24:14.166 --> 24:16.234
I think my past
caught up with me.

24:16.301 --> 24:18.536
I can't talk now.
I'll explain everything later.

24:18.603 --> 24:20.604
Call me back.
I love you.

24:24.942 --> 24:26.709
I-I called him back,

24:26.777 --> 24:28.344
and, um...

24:28.445 --> 24:31.280
he said he was getting
off the ship in a few days

24:31.348 --> 24:32.581
and to meet him here.

24:34.784 --> 24:37.952
When I saw him,
he was so scared.

24:38.020 --> 24:41.222
He told me to stay put

24:41.290 --> 24:43.524
and that he'd be back soon.

24:43.592 --> 24:46.661
That was the last time
I saw him.

24:46.728 --> 24:48.596
Do you have any idea

24:48.664 --> 24:51.556
what he meant by his past
catching up with him?

24:51.557 --> 24:54.948
I'd always assumed that
he had some sort of

24:54.949 --> 24:56.129
trouble with the law,

24:56.130 --> 24:57.396
but he never wanted
to talk about it,

24:57.439 --> 24:59.106
so I learned not to ask.

25:01.876 --> 25:06.480
You have to understand, Adam was
the gentlest man in the world.

25:06.547 --> 25:09.715
So when he told me something
happened on the ship

25:09.783 --> 25:11.617
and we had to go...

25:11.685 --> 25:13.319
I said okay.

25:13.386 --> 25:14.754
Okay.

25:14.821 --> 25:16.589
Suzie, listen,
do you, uh...

25:16.656 --> 25:19.425
do you have a photo of Adam,
what he looked like

25:19.493 --> 25:22.395
before the... the surgery?
- Yeah. Yeah.

25:30.038 --> 25:33.007
Can you... think
of any reason

25:33.075 --> 25:36.277
or do you know why Adam
would have had plastic surgery?

25:36.345 --> 25:38.346
No.

25:38.414 --> 25:42.050
No, he just said he would look
different when he came back.

25:42.118 --> 25:44.052
But he promised
to tell me everything

25:44.120 --> 25:46.487
- as soon as we were safe.
- Okay,

25:46.555 --> 25:49.990
and you were just gonna...
go with him, no questions asked?

25:51.460 --> 25:53.527
If the person you loved
had to move

25:53.595 --> 25:55.729
halfway across the world,
what would you do?

25:59.534 --> 26:00.856
What do you think?

26:00.881 --> 26:01.932
I think something
must have happened

26:01.933 --> 26:03.550
on that cable ship
that set this guy off.

26:03.835 --> 26:05.369
Let's go find out
what it was.

26:24.361 --> 26:25.628
Gentlemen.

26:25.696 --> 26:27.096
I'm Cory Sampson.

26:27.163 --> 26:29.131
- Welcome to the <i>Triumph.</i>
- Thank you.

26:29.199 --> 26:30.399
Not much I can

26:30.467 --> 26:31.667
tell you about Adam Raines.

26:31.735 --> 26:33.535
He only been working
here shy a year.

26:33.603 --> 26:36.238
Quiet guy. Kept to himself.
Hard worker.

26:36.306 --> 26:38.473
Could've made it a career
if he'd stuck around.

26:38.541 --> 26:40.109
No complaints?
Never missed a shift

26:40.176 --> 26:42.011
till he went on the
milk run this morning.

26:42.079 --> 26:44.347
I assume, since you're here,
he's in some kind of trouble?

26:44.414 --> 26:45.514
Adam Raines is dead, sir.

26:45.582 --> 26:46.882
Sorry to hear that.

26:46.950 --> 26:48.417
Though you don't seem
very surprised.

26:48.485 --> 26:50.520
Ships like this,

26:50.587 --> 26:52.522
hardly in port,
always at sea...

26:52.589 --> 26:55.158
they've been known to attract
the occasional drifter.

26:55.226 --> 26:56.927
Yeah, middle of nowhere,
good place to hide.

26:56.995 --> 26:58.863
Not the type to file notice.

26:58.930 --> 27:01.566
When one takes off, I just
assume they start running again.

27:01.634 --> 27:04.848
All right, uh,
any mishaps on the rig recently,

27:04.849 --> 27:06.509
perhaps one that would
have sent Adam running?

27:06.748 --> 27:08.782
Incidents happen
all the time out here.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.594
This isn't exactly
a cruise ship.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.263
Also, maybe he got into a beef

27:12.330 --> 27:13.964
with somebody who followed
him off the rig.

27:14.032 --> 27:16.099
Anybody else not come
back this morning?

27:16.167 --> 27:18.201
Everyone else is accounted for.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.670
All right, listen, you got
a crew list or something

27:20.738 --> 27:23.640
that would show us the people
that left the same time Adam did?

27:23.708 --> 27:25.575
Sure thing.
List is in my office.

27:30.414 --> 27:33.116
Adam left on shore
leave five days ago.

27:33.184 --> 27:36.119
Huh, it looks like Billy Murphy
hopped on that chopper last minute.

27:36.187 --> 27:38.221
- Who's Billy Murphy?
- Adam's roommate.

27:38.289 --> 27:40.457
Punk from Boston, got
here a few weeks ago.

27:40.524 --> 27:43.726
All right, we need
to talk with him.

27:46.563 --> 27:48.364
- What's this?
- Well, it turns out

27:48.432 --> 27:50.232
Adam Raines isn't
our vic's real name,

27:50.334 --> 27:51.895
so I'm looking through
facial recognition to see

27:51.920 --> 27:53.120
if I can get a match.

27:53.671 --> 27:55.271
Any luck searching the house?

27:55.339 --> 27:57.006
Place was cleaned out--
no pictures,

27:57.074 --> 27:59.275
no personal items,
even the fridge was empty.

27:59.343 --> 28:00.443
Mmm.

28:00.511 --> 28:03.012
Our vic didn't want
to leave a trail.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.148
Looks like we got a hit.

28:05.216 --> 28:07.351
U.S. Marshals?

28:07.418 --> 28:09.586
Identity's classified.

28:09.654 --> 28:11.622
Who is this guy?

28:20.899 --> 28:22.901
Give me a second.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.471
Hey, Lori, what do you got?

28:26.539 --> 28:28.006
Well, I just got off the phone

28:28.074 --> 28:29.942
with a friend
at the U.S. Marshal's Office.

28:30.010 --> 28:32.678
Our vic's name
was Jimmy Sheehan.

28:32.746 --> 28:34.380
Who's Jimmy Sheehan?

28:34.448 --> 28:36.382
Well, according to the marshals,

28:36.450 --> 28:38.284
he's a proud member of the
Witness Protection Program.

28:38.352 --> 28:40.720
Sheehan was an auto mechanic
from Boston,

28:40.788 --> 28:42.322
and one of three witnesses

28:42.390 --> 28:44.524
to a murder committed
by Mickey O'Hara.

28:44.592 --> 28:47.161
Yeah. Also known as
"Lucky" Mickey O'Hara

28:47.229 --> 28:48.662
of the Boston Irish Mob.

28:48.729 --> 28:51.031
Head of the L Street Crew,
O'Hara was convicted

28:51.099 --> 28:53.033
of killing a man
on Castle Island

28:53.101 --> 28:55.035
in South Boston three years ago.

28:55.103 --> 28:58.071
Turns out Sheehan's testimony
put O'Hara away,

28:58.139 --> 29:00.374
and after the trial,
the three witnesses

29:00.441 --> 29:02.876
were put into WitSec
and then moved to Arizona.

29:02.944 --> 29:04.946
Okay, well, let me guess--
the Witness Protection

29:05.013 --> 29:06.715
did not prove to be
very protective.

29:06.783 --> 29:09.051
No. The other two men
were dead within a year.

29:09.118 --> 29:10.686
After that,
Sheehan left the system

29:10.754 --> 29:12.755
until he resurfaced here
under the name...

29:12.823 --> 29:13.823
Adam Raines.

29:13.891 --> 29:16.259
Good work, guys.

29:16.327 --> 29:18.428
So, Sheehan and his roommate,
they're both from Boston.

29:18.496 --> 29:20.597
Maybe Murphy was sent
out here to find Sheehan.

29:20.664 --> 29:22.398
Could be a retaliation hit.

29:25.536 --> 29:27.803
Apparently, Murphy packed
in a hurry.

29:27.871 --> 29:29.404
How many ways
off this ship?

29:29.472 --> 29:31.807
Only way off is
the way you came on.

29:42.085 --> 29:44.887
That's Murphy.

29:47.424 --> 29:49.992
Get up there!
Move!

29:53.931 --> 29:55.231
Billy Murphy.

29:55.299 --> 29:57.367
Back off, or I
cut his throat!

29:57.435 --> 29:58.402
Calm down.

29:58.469 --> 29:59.570
I just want to talk,
that's all.

29:59.637 --> 30:00.570
I'm not talking
to anybody.

30:00.638 --> 30:01.871
Now, back the hell up.

30:01.939 --> 30:03.106
Okay, listen,

30:03.174 --> 30:04.274
I'm not moving.

30:04.341 --> 30:05.375
I just want to
talk to you.

30:05.442 --> 30:06.742
Okay? Just have
a conversation.

30:06.810 --> 30:09.412
- Let the guy go.
- Not gonna happen, brother.

30:09.479 --> 30:10.947
Don't do anything
stupid, okay?

30:11.015 --> 30:12.382
Right here, huh? Right here.

30:12.450 --> 30:13.950
Hey!

30:20.325 --> 30:21.959
How about now, brother,

30:22.027 --> 30:23.494
can we talk now?

30:23.561 --> 30:24.728
Let's go.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.003
<i>Okay, please.</i>

30:31.071 --> 30:32.742
Please, please,
please, trust me,

30:32.743 --> 30:34.126
this is gonna be
a whole lot easier

30:34.127 --> 30:36.095
if you just tell us
about Jimmy Sheehan.

30:36.163 --> 30:38.097
Aren't we outside
your jurisdiction?

30:38.164 --> 30:39.764
He's not the smartest guy,

30:39.832 --> 30:40.899
is he?

30:40.966 --> 30:42.066
Yeah, you're
right, Murphy,

30:42.134 --> 30:44.535
these are international
waters, okay?

30:44.603 --> 30:47.872
Which means we're bound
to the laws of the flag

30:47.939 --> 30:50.741
that the ship flies,
which is what, Daniel, again?

30:50.809 --> 30:52.409
Chinese.

30:52.477 --> 30:53.644
Oh, yeah, it's Chinese.

30:53.712 --> 30:55.579
Okay, that's good,
because that means

30:55.647 --> 30:58.582
that out here we're not actually
members of law enforcement.

30:58.650 --> 31:00.484
All right? Which also
means we're not bound

31:00.552 --> 31:02.886
by silly little rules like,
I don't know, due process,

31:02.954 --> 31:04.088
so that's fine
with me if

31:04.155 --> 31:05.589
that's the way you want to go.
No, no,

31:05.657 --> 31:07.224
that's not the way... please.
- Why not?

31:07.292 --> 31:08.725
Nobody's around.
That's not the way.

31:08.793 --> 31:10.293
Please trust me,
that's an ugly way.

31:10.361 --> 31:12.229
We can help each other,
I believe.

31:12.297 --> 31:14.164
- Help?
- Yes, help.

31:14.232 --> 31:15.966
- How?
- I'll tell you how.

31:16.033 --> 31:17.968
Uh, we, uh, checked
the satellite phone

31:18.035 --> 31:19.202
on the ship.

31:19.270 --> 31:21.571
We know that you made
some calls to the 617--

31:21.638 --> 31:23.673
that's Boston, right?
- Yeah.

31:23.740 --> 31:26.342
Well, I can only imagine you were
calling a loved one.

31:26.410 --> 31:29.611
We can help you by letting them
know that you are now in custody

31:29.679 --> 31:30.813
and that you are
fully cooperating

31:30.880 --> 31:31.980
with the police.

31:32.048 --> 31:33.115
It's ringing.

31:33.182 --> 31:35.350
- I got it.
- No, no, no, no, wait, wait.

31:35.418 --> 31:36.918
Wait, I'll talk. I'll talk!

31:36.986 --> 31:39.287
I'll talk. Come on.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.155
Man wants to talk.

31:40.223 --> 31:41.824
All right,
then, talk.

31:41.892 --> 31:43.526
Look, I never wanted

31:43.594 --> 31:45.028
to start anything.

31:45.096 --> 31:46.964
I owe 30 large to L Street.

31:47.032 --> 31:49.400
Bad bets. I came out here
to hide, make some money,

31:49.468 --> 31:51.435
you know, pay 'em off
before they found me.

31:51.503 --> 31:54.272
All right. So then
you recognized Sheehan, huh?

31:54.340 --> 31:56.308
Not right off.
It took me, like,

31:56.375 --> 31:58.543
two weeks to figure it out,
but eventually.

31:58.611 --> 32:00.145
I mean, it's not every day

32:00.213 --> 32:01.546
someone takes down
Mickey O'Hara.

32:01.614 --> 32:02.948
Everybody back home knows Jimmy.

32:03.015 --> 32:04.616
Okay, so you
called back home

32:04.684 --> 32:06.451
and what, you
arrange a visit?

32:06.519 --> 32:07.953
I did what I had to do.

32:08.020 --> 32:09.721
They said they were
sending out some guys.

32:09.789 --> 32:11.490
I flew off to Oahu to meet them.

32:11.557 --> 32:12.958
I told them

32:13.025 --> 32:14.626
where to find Jimmy,

32:14.694 --> 32:16.261
and they cleared my debt.

32:16.329 --> 32:18.196
- That's it.
- All right,

32:18.264 --> 32:19.198
you said "guys."

32:19.265 --> 32:20.232
What guys?

32:20.300 --> 32:21.867
John and Simon O'Toole.

32:21.935 --> 32:24.103
Brothers, age 35 and 33.

32:24.171 --> 32:25.705
Grew up in Southie.

32:25.773 --> 32:29.509
Both of them joined the L Street
Crew before they were 18.

32:29.577 --> 32:32.513
Suspected in over 12 murders
that the government knows about,

32:32.580 --> 32:34.748
including the witnesses
from the O'Hara case.

32:34.816 --> 32:36.016
They're widely considered
the top two

32:36.084 --> 32:38.318
triggermen for
the Irish Mob in Boston.

32:38.386 --> 32:40.554
These are the kind of guys
that would have no problem

32:40.622 --> 32:42.589
putting a bullet
in Jimmy Sheehan's chest.

32:42.657 --> 32:44.925
Got a hit back from TSA.

32:44.992 --> 32:47.093
Looks like the O'Toole brothers
arrived on the island

32:47.161 --> 32:48.561
the day before
Sheehan was killed.

32:48.629 --> 32:50.663
Guys, I just pinged
the cell phone number

32:50.731 --> 32:51.764
Murphy used to contact them.

32:51.832 --> 32:53.699
They're at the Kalihi Motel.

32:53.767 --> 32:54.833
That's where
Suzie's staying.

32:54.901 --> 32:56.468
They're tying up
loose ends.

33:20.596 --> 33:23.799
You're making this
so hard on yourself.

33:24.834 --> 33:26.969
Just tell us what we
need to know, huh?

33:27.037 --> 33:28.037
Where's Jimmy?

33:41.018 --> 33:42.485
Aah!

33:42.553 --> 33:43.653
Danny.

33:45.790 --> 33:46.790
Freeze!

33:46.858 --> 33:47.891
Drop your guns.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.126
Don't take another step!

33:49.193 --> 33:51.094
Got three seconds,
or I put a bullet in her.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.162
Put the gun down.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.330
One.

33:53.398 --> 33:54.865
Put it down.
Two.

33:59.203 --> 34:02.272
Three.

34:02.339 --> 34:04.107
Face down, put your hands
behind your back.

34:17.922 --> 34:22.159
They kept asking about a
man named Jimmy Sheehan.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.161
They wanted to
know where he was.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.731
I told them I didn't know,
but they didn't believe me.

34:30.002 --> 34:32.969
Come on, we need
to get you to a safe place.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.815
You hear that?

34:42.882 --> 34:45.050
Yeah, I mean,
I'm not a rocket scientist,

34:45.118 --> 34:47.953
but if the O'Tooles thought
that Jimmy Sheehan was alive,

34:48.021 --> 34:50.222
it means that
they did not kill him.

34:50.290 --> 34:53.059
Yeah, okay, so if they
didn't kill him, who did?

35:08.596 --> 35:10.430
You do a lot of smiling
for a guy

35:10.479 --> 35:12.113
who just saw
his brother get shot.

35:12.181 --> 35:14.848
Simon knew the risks.

35:15.917 --> 35:16.850
And I'm smiling

35:16.918 --> 35:18.018
'cause you got nothing.

35:18.086 --> 35:20.453
- We got nothing.
- Nothing except, uh,

35:20.521 --> 35:22.555
kidnapping,
first-degree assault...

35:22.623 --> 35:24.724
- Murder one.
- Murder one.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.892
I have the best lawyer
in the world on speed dial.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.894
He'll get it down to
a class B felony--

35:28.961 --> 35:31.964
ten years max, I'll
be out in five.

35:32.031 --> 35:33.566
You think so?

35:33.633 --> 35:34.967
Know so.

35:35.034 --> 35:38.237
Well, that is, of course,
if the girl makes it to trial.

35:38.305 --> 35:40.239
I'm sorry, is that a threat?

35:40.307 --> 35:41.641
Okay, all right,
wait a minute.

35:41.709 --> 35:42.642
What about
the murder

35:42.710 --> 35:43.844
of Jimmy Sheehan, huh?

35:43.911 --> 35:45.078
I mean, ballistics
are going to come back

35:45.146 --> 35:46.079
on the nine-millimeter.

35:46.147 --> 35:47.381
It's going
to match your gun.

35:47.448 --> 35:49.016
No, it won't, 'cause
I didn't kill him.

35:49.084 --> 35:50.084
If you didn't
kill him,

35:50.152 --> 35:51.519
what are you doing in Hawaii?

35:51.586 --> 35:53.153
Don't say
vacation.

35:53.221 --> 35:55.556
We know about the phone call.

35:58.759 --> 36:00.760
Murphy couldn't keep
his mouth shut, huh?

36:02.062 --> 36:03.863
All right,

36:03.930 --> 36:05.698
so it's possible

36:05.766 --> 36:09.001
me and Simon heard our old pal
Jimmy was here, and maybe

36:09.069 --> 36:10.536
we came out to have a chat.

36:10.604 --> 36:13.439
Murphy gave you his address?

36:13.506 --> 36:14.974
And we figured we'd tail him
to a nice quiet spot

36:15.042 --> 36:16.342
to have our conversation,

36:16.410 --> 36:19.012
but we lost him
that afternoon.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.958
We thought the trail was
dead till we realized

36:20.983 --> 36:22.357
he rented a room in a motel.

36:23.919 --> 36:25.886
And that's when we
stumbled onto the girl.

36:25.954 --> 36:27.654
At what point
did you lose Jimmy?

36:27.722 --> 36:31.025
Parking structure
on Ala Moana Boulevard.

36:31.093 --> 36:33.561
We watched him pull in,
waited for hours.

36:33.629 --> 36:35.763
He never came back out.

36:35.831 --> 36:38.032
If Jimmy got popped, it
was in that building.

36:40.636 --> 36:42.638
Thanks for the information.

36:44.340 --> 36:47.476
Oh, keep smiling.

36:47.543 --> 36:49.845
I almost forgot.

36:49.912 --> 36:51.680
Uh, ballistics already
came back on your gun.

36:51.747 --> 36:53.648
I told you I didn't kill him.

36:53.716 --> 36:54.949
No, you didn't
kill him,

36:55.017 --> 36:58.687
but the bullets matched
a bunch of other open murders,

36:58.755 --> 37:01.656
you know, very specifically,
the two other witnesses

37:01.724 --> 37:04.459
in the Mickey O'Hara case,
so you should call your lawyer--

37:04.527 --> 37:06.094
that really brilliant lawyer
you were talking about--

37:06.161 --> 37:07.128
maybe get your sentence
knocked down

37:07.196 --> 37:09.330
to 50, 60 years,
something like that.

37:09.397 --> 37:10.497
Enjoy federal prison.

37:10.565 --> 37:11.933
It's really nice
this time of year.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.569
See you.

37:20.811 --> 37:22.745
So I got the
security footage

37:22.813 --> 37:25.549
from the parking structure
where O'Toole lost Sheehan.

37:25.616 --> 37:27.885
There's no video, but they
do have a stop-motion camera

37:27.953 --> 37:29.153
that captures license plates.

37:29.221 --> 37:30.321
Okay.

37:30.389 --> 37:32.656
Sheehan arrives here, right?

37:33.958 --> 37:35.626
But he never
leaves.

37:35.694 --> 37:36.627
Oh, he left.

37:36.695 --> 37:37.895
I mean, the car had
to come out.

37:37.963 --> 37:39.263
Right, so I checked
out the structure.

37:39.331 --> 37:40.464
Turns out that
there's another exit

37:40.532 --> 37:41.966
on the far end
of the lot.

37:42.034 --> 37:43.367
It's only for
monthly users.

37:43.435 --> 37:44.469
Well, they got
security footage there?

37:44.536 --> 37:48.206
No, but what it does
require is an ID card.

37:49.474 --> 37:50.975
And that'll be the list
of people who have one.

37:51.042 --> 37:53.243
Let's take a look.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.781
One person swipes
his card three times.

37:57.849 --> 37:59.316
That doesn't
make any sense.

37:59.383 --> 38:01.184
Three times--
that's an odd number.

38:01.252 --> 38:02.819
I mean, you come in,
you come out,

38:02.886 --> 38:04.754
bang.
Unless

38:04.821 --> 38:06.021
- you exit twice.
- That's right,

38:06.089 --> 38:08.157
once in somebody
else's car

38:08.224 --> 38:09.858
and then you double
back for your own.

38:09.926 --> 38:12.594
So maybe our guy drives out
Sheehan's car

38:12.662 --> 38:14.028
and then comes back for his.

38:14.096 --> 38:15.063
Pull his ID.

38:15.130 --> 38:17.098
I think we just found
our killer.

38:19.668 --> 38:21.636
And our plastic surgeon.

38:27.143 --> 38:29.143
Can I help you?

38:30.946 --> 38:32.880
Wait, you can't go
back there.

38:32.948 --> 38:34.949
Dr. James is about
to begin a procedure.

38:47.865 --> 38:49.800
<i>So he didn't die</i>
<i>from the gunshot?</i>

38:49.867 --> 38:53.269
<i>No, no, he died on the table--</i>

38:53.337 --> 38:55.872
<i>a complication</i>
<i>with the surgery.</i>

38:55.939 --> 38:58.541
Nobody said
anything?

38:58.609 --> 39:00.242
The doctor was, um,

39:00.310 --> 39:02.211
was doing the surgery,
uh, alone.

39:02.278 --> 39:05.080
Yeah, Jimmy insisted that he
do it that way because he was

39:05.148 --> 39:06.648
worried that his real identity
would get out.

39:08.484 --> 39:10.318
When he died, the
doctor panicked.

39:10.386 --> 39:12.721
Thought he was going
to lose his practice,

39:12.789 --> 39:14.089
so he tried to cover it up.

39:14.157 --> 39:16.926
Right, he put the body in
the trunk of Jimmy's car

39:16.994 --> 39:18.428
and he left it
on the street.

39:20.932 --> 39:23.768
Why shoot him?

39:23.835 --> 39:26.904
Because he figured
if anybody found the body,

39:26.972 --> 39:27.972
they'd just assume

39:28.040 --> 39:30.008
that Jimmy's past
had caught up to him.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.077
You know?

39:34.847 --> 39:37.882
I just don't understand.

39:37.950 --> 39:39.450
Why didn't he just
tell me everything?

39:39.518 --> 39:40.651
Well, I think,

39:40.719 --> 39:42.520
because he didn't want
anything to happen to you.

39:42.587 --> 39:44.555
He was trying to protect you
and keep you safe.

39:55.934 --> 39:57.935
I'm really sorry.

40:26.298 --> 40:27.231
Okay.

40:27.299 --> 40:28.232
You like that?

40:28.299 --> 40:30.300
Yes, I do.

40:30.368 --> 40:32.169
Now you can watch
all the TV you want.

40:32.236 --> 40:35.239
This is, uh...
I'm touched, thank you.

40:35.306 --> 40:37.307
Uh, but I do believe
that I found a place.

40:37.375 --> 40:39.009
Really?

40:39.077 --> 40:40.044
Yeah, nice little house

40:40.111 --> 40:41.679
for rent right down
the street from you.

40:41.746 --> 40:43.013
Forget about it.

40:43.081 --> 40:45.550
Oh, right, rule number 56:

40:45.618 --> 40:47.085
No coworkers living
on the same block.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.219
Something like that,
yeah, just...

40:48.287 --> 40:49.421
no, put it out of your mind.

40:49.488 --> 40:50.421
Okay?

40:50.489 --> 40:51.723
These are still
very nice.

40:51.791 --> 40:54.259
Wow, they work good.

40:54.326 --> 40:57.261
Can't hear you at all--
perfect.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.034
Excuse me.

41:04.102 --> 41:05.435
Excuse me, excuse me,
hey, hey, hey!

41:07.772 --> 41:09.573
What the hell are you wearing?
I wholeheartedly approve.

41:09.641 --> 41:10.841
I'm just curious,
that's all.

41:10.909 --> 41:12.909
It's theme movie night at Max's.

41:12.977 --> 41:14.878
- We're all invited.
- I-I wasn't invited.

41:14.946 --> 41:16.213
I-I wasn't invited
either.

41:16.281 --> 41:18.882
Oh, yes, you were.

41:18.950 --> 41:20.150
See?

41:24.188 --> 41:26.122
Max is
Doc@SpaceTrekkie?

41:26.190 --> 41:27.557
Yeah, it's his personal e-mail.

41:27.625 --> 41:29.392
It's a little
too personal.

41:29.460 --> 41:30.927
- I thought it was spam.
- Me, too, I just, I...

41:30.995 --> 41:31.928
I knew this was your fault.

41:31.996 --> 41:33.396
See?
What are you talking about?

41:33.464 --> 41:35.065
This is why he's been acting so crazy.
It's your fault.

41:35.132 --> 41:36.366
How is it
my fault?

41:36.434 --> 41:37.800
'Cause I'm not good
with the e-mails.

41:37.868 --> 41:39.268
Max, we're sorry we didn't
respond to your invitation.

41:39.336 --> 41:41.337
Lori.

41:45.442 --> 41:46.842
Tell me about
it, stud.
