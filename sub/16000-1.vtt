00:59.459 --> 01:00.949
Hello.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.961
Yes, I picked her up.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.757
I know, I know.

01:04.864 --> 01:07.560
Talk to her yourself.

01:07.667 --> 01:11.763
Daddy wants to talk.
Quick, it's expensive.

01:12.372 --> 01:12.963
Sanda?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.665
Can't you see I'm busy?

01:14.774 --> 01:16.469
Take this phone!

01:16.576 --> 01:18.373
He can call back.

01:18.478 --> 01:19.672
Take the phone, I swear!

01:19.779 --> 01:22.373
What?
You'll punish me?

01:22.482 --> 01:25.747
Call us at home.
In a half an hour.

01:29.456 --> 01:33.153
What's with you!
Why are you like this?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.757
You need help.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.358
Excuse me?

01:54.581 --> 01:56.378
Sanda, are you OK?

01:57.250 --> 01:59.946
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

02:20.773 --> 02:22.365
What are you doing?

02:23.276 --> 02:24.971
I saw someone.

02:25.078 --> 02:25.669
What?

02:25.778 --> 02:27.973
Someone was on the road!

02:28.081 --> 02:29.673
Probably a dog.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.952
Can't we go now?

02:57.577 --> 02:59.670
Super...

03:21.568 --> 03:23.661
Try the engine, please.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.149
Try it again.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.754
Mom, what do I do?

03:55.768 --> 03:57.668
Mom, what do I do?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.977
Mom...

04:18.057 --> 04:19.752
Mom?

04:25.465 --> 04:26.955
Mom!

04:44.851 --> 04:46.148
Mom!

05:16.683 --> 05:18.150
Mom!

05:27.460 --> 05:28.950
Mom!

05:32.065 --> 05:33.464
Mom!

06:45.271 --> 06:49.469
Police station,
hold the line...

Police station,

09:05.778 --> 09:08.576
Full stop.
Good?

09:08.681 --> 09:12.640
See you next week.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.648
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.954
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.653
Bye.

09:32.371 --> 09:33.963
ClÃ©mentine.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.074
Here.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.943
- My curriculum from last year.
- Thanks.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.953
I had a hard time finding it.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.554
Thanks so much.
It'll be a great help.

09:53.459 --> 09:55.757
Are they that bad?

09:55.861 --> 09:57.453
Not at all.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.956
I need some time to adjust.

10:00.866 --> 10:05.166
- How long have you been here?
- Nearly 3 months.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.762
You're managing well.

10:08.874 --> 10:11.672
I'd love to speak your language
like you speak mine.

10:12.678 --> 10:15.772
- My French is a catastrophe.
- Don't exaggerate.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.546
Enjoy your weekend.

10:20.653 --> 10:23.349
Thanks again.
Bye.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.241
- Hello?
- It's me.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.149
What do you feel like tonight?

12:02.254 --> 12:03.949
You.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.250
That's all?

12:05.357 --> 12:07.655
I wouldn't say no to some wine.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.955
Wine, me...
Anything else?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.757
Whatever you rummage up.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.264
- How long?
- Half an hour, traffic's good.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.459
- See you soon.
- Bye.

14:52.658 --> 14:53.750
Lucas?

15:43.275 --> 15:45.971
- How are you?
- Fine.

15:57.856 --> 15:58.948
What is it?

15:59.058 --> 16:00.252
Nothing.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.151
What's so funny?

16:04.263 --> 16:06.959
- Hope it's productive, at least.
- So-so.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.161
And you?

16:11.270 --> 16:14.467
They were irritating today.
A dictation calmed them down.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.770
I'm calling it quits!

16:17.876 --> 16:19.366
Already?

16:20.279 --> 16:21.678
Listen up,

16:21.780 --> 16:25.045
you know a writer
never stops working.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.244
Here, for example,
I turn off the computer.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.946
I close the lid...

16:31.357 --> 16:32.756
I stand up...

16:34.560 --> 16:36.460
But in my head,
I'm still working.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.258
Are you coming?

16:47.172 --> 16:49.367
- And now?
- I'm working.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.144
- And now?
- Still working...

17:00.052 --> 17:01.952
- And now?
- You can keep trying.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.047
- And now?
- Extreme concentration!

17:11.363 --> 17:12.660
Shit!

17:19.771 --> 17:21.262
You lose.

17:26.578 --> 17:27.771
Can I come in?

17:42.661 --> 17:44.253
Are you still there?

17:57.176 --> 17:58.575
Well?

17:58.677 --> 17:59.371
It's delicious.

17:59.478 --> 18:00.672
Really?

18:04.049 --> 18:06.244
It's unusual, but...

18:06.351 --> 18:08.148
It's interesting.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.246
Unusual? How?

18:14.660 --> 18:16.355
Particular.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.465
What exactly is in it?

18:24.570 --> 18:26.367
Everything.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.463
What do you mean?

18:28.574 --> 18:30.667
I threw in all the groceries.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.767
That explains it.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.972
It's all-inclusive.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.049
Starter, main dish, dessert...
From soup to nuts.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.447
You don't like it?

18:39.551 --> 18:42.145
- Yes, I do.
- lf you don't like it...

18:42.254 --> 18:45.951
- Fine, that's enough.
- Let's clear the table.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.454
That's the way it goes.

18:49.561 --> 18:52.052
- We're finished.
- It's not bad...

18:52.164 --> 18:54.155
Get out.
You've hurt me enough.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.066
- Are you sleeping?
- No.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.275
Yes, you're sleeping.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.677
I'm not sleeping.

19:17.856 --> 19:20.552
- It looks bad.
- Really?

19:20.659 --> 19:23.355
Really bad.
I think she's cheating on him.

19:23.462 --> 19:24.952
That's unfortunate.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.659
Want me to go?

19:32.771 --> 19:33.965
No, it's my turn.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.072
It's so annoying.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.740
Are you going or am I?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.249
It's alright. I'll go.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.654
Doggy...

20:02.868 --> 20:04.358
Doggy!

20:19.551 --> 20:21.348
Here you are.

20:21.453 --> 20:23.444
I thought you lost your appetite.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.950
Stop barking.
It disturbs everyone.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.654
Easy, easy.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.457
That's it. Nothing left.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.963
Go on.

20:36.468 --> 20:37.366
Get lost!

20:49.781 --> 20:51.442
The beast has been subdued.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.345
Let's go to bed?

20:58.056 --> 20:59.045
Come on.

20:59.157 --> 21:00.556
Enough of this crap.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.253
I'm exhausted.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.056
Are you sleepy, Mr. Sleepy?

21:07.165 --> 21:09.360
Aren't you sleepy?

21:09.468 --> 21:11.368
- You're never sleepy.
- Never.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.165
- How do you do it?
- I don't know.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.970
- What's your secret?
- A little secret.

21:18.076 --> 21:19.475
Tell me.

21:46.071 --> 21:48.767
I'm going downstairs
to work a bit, OK?

22:11.263 --> 22:12.958
This is such trash!

22:49.167 --> 22:50.361
Who's on the line?

22:52.771 --> 22:53.965
Who's on the line?

22:57.075 --> 22:58.667
Who's on the line?

23:01.079 --> 23:02.171
Who's on the line?

26:32.257 --> 26:33.451
Lucas?

26:36.161 --> 26:37.355
Lucas...

26:39.364 --> 26:40.661
Wake up.

26:49.574 --> 26:51.064
Wake up.

26:57.849 --> 26:59.544
What's going on?

26:59.651 --> 27:01.141
Didn't you hear it?

27:03.054 --> 27:04.954
- What?
- The noise outside.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.166
What are you doing?

27:17.268 --> 27:18.565
Come on.
Let's go down and see.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.249
Are you coming?

27:54.673 --> 27:55.970
What are you doing?

27:56.074 --> 27:57.473
- Nothing.
- Come on.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.658
Why the hell's my car there?

28:28.673 --> 28:29.970
Come see.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.174
Do you see?

28:37.849 --> 28:40.340
Don't be silly. I'll just check.

28:40.452 --> 28:41.544
Stay there.

28:51.863 --> 28:53.160
Anyone there?

29:00.071 --> 29:01.265
Is anyone there?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.138
Lucas!

29:10.248 --> 29:11.340
Stay there!

29:34.873 --> 29:36.067
Don't move!

29:36.674 --> 29:38.369
Lucas, get inside!

29:49.154 --> 29:50.348
Who?

29:55.059 --> 29:56.458
Stop!

30:01.266 --> 30:02.961
They came into my house.

30:04.769 --> 30:06.259
No! I don't have them.

30:08.173 --> 30:10.073
They're in the car!

30:11.776 --> 30:14.267
- You really don't have the papers?
- No.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.374
We don't have them.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.949
Isn't there anything you can do?

30:19.050 --> 30:20.244
We'll handle it tomorrow.

30:20.351 --> 30:22.945
What about the former
owner's name?

30:23.555 --> 30:25.352
Okay...

30:25.456 --> 30:27.651
I'll call back tomorrow.

30:30.061 --> 30:33.155
What a fool.
I left everything in the car.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.640
What are you doing?

30:56.054 --> 30:57.248
Come on.

30:57.555 --> 30:59.455
I'll switch the meter on.

31:19.077 --> 31:20.374
I can't see anything.

31:21.079 --> 31:21.977
Wait!

31:27.352 --> 31:28.546
Come on.

31:37.862 --> 31:38.954
Wait for me!

32:00.251 --> 32:01.343
Shit.

32:15.867 --> 32:18.267
Hurry, come see.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.265
What is it?

32:28.479 --> 32:29.673
Look.

32:33.251 --> 32:34.946
- What is it?
- Get down!

32:41.859 --> 32:43.656
- Wait.
- Stay there!

32:49.167 --> 32:51.761
- I'm coming with you.
- Stay there. Don't move.

33:03.848 --> 33:05.145
Do you see something?

33:07.752 --> 33:09.151
Do you see anything?

33:09.654 --> 33:10.951
There's nothing.

33:18.563 --> 33:20.758
Shit!
Work, dammit!

33:25.870 --> 33:27.269
Stay there.

33:45.156 --> 33:46.748
Come on!

34:04.075 --> 34:05.269
Look!

34:06.677 --> 34:07.974
Someone's there.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.958
- Do you see anything?
- Nothing.

34:33.271 --> 34:34.465
What is it?

35:39.370 --> 35:41.770
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

35:43.174 --> 35:44.971
We gotta call the police.

35:59.257 --> 36:00.554
It'll be OK.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.452
They're inside.

36:05.263 --> 36:06.662
No.

36:06.764 --> 36:08.959
They're in the house.

36:16.874 --> 36:18.364
I'll go downstairs.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.077
I'll go see.

36:51.075 --> 36:52.269
Close the door.

37:00.551 --> 37:01.950
Close it.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.453
Close it!

40:58.355 --> 41:00.653
Lucas!

41:03.060 --> 41:03.958
What's wrong?

41:04.061 --> 41:05.653
Answer me.
What's happening?

41:19.877 --> 41:21.174
Lucas!

41:49.673 --> 41:51.163
Clem, open up!

41:51.275 --> 41:52.469
Open the door!

41:52.576 --> 41:54.771
Clem! Open the door!

41:57.047 --> 41:58.639
Open the door!

41:58.749 --> 41:59.738
I can't.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.147
It's jammed!

42:10.261 --> 42:11.660
Lucas, shit!

42:14.465 --> 42:15.955
What happened?

42:17.067 --> 42:18.762
What did they do to you?

42:23.073 --> 42:24.165
Pull it out.

42:25.576 --> 42:26.770
Don't move.

42:28.078 --> 42:29.477
This can't be happening!

42:35.052 --> 42:36.451
Go on.

42:40.157 --> 42:41.749
Pull it out.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.057
- I can't.
- Pull it out!

42:51.168 --> 42:53.068
Pull it out!

42:53.170 --> 42:56.571
Pull it out, dammit!

43:01.078 --> 43:02.170
Come on!

43:14.858 --> 43:15.950
Hold it tight!

43:21.165 --> 43:22.359
Hang on tight.

43:31.075 --> 43:32.167
Get up!

44:03.073 --> 44:05.268
- What are you doing?
- Wait.

44:14.251 --> 44:16.742
I'll look for a way out.

44:22.059 --> 44:23.048
Hurry up.

44:29.166 --> 44:30.463
I'll be quick.

44:55.559 --> 44:56.753

Come on.

51:28.051 --> 51:29.450
Come on!

51:36.359 --> 51:37.553
This way.

51:45.068 --> 51:46.160
Get down.

51:54.578 --> 51:55.977
Get down.

52:08.158 --> 52:11.958
This way.

52:12.062 --> 52:17.364
Go on, go on.

52:24.674 --> 52:26.369
Lucas, try again!

52:26.476 --> 52:29.968
Get up!
You can do it. Try again.

52:30.080 --> 52:31.945
- I can't make it.
- Come with me!

52:32.048 --> 52:33.345
Go on.

52:33.450 --> 52:36.442
We won't make it otherwise.
Go on!

52:36.553 --> 52:38.453
They're coming.
Go get help!

52:38.555 --> 52:39.647
Go on, Clem.

52:39.756 --> 52:41.747
Go get help!

52:41.858 --> 52:43.450
I'll hide!

52:43.560 --> 52:44.959
Go on.

52:45.061 --> 52:48.360
Go on, Clem.

52:48.465 --> 52:51.957
Hurry up!

56:24.748 --> 56:26.147
Shit.

57:31.448 --> 57:32.642
Clem!

57:42.258 --> 57:43.452
Clem!

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:58.170
She can't breathe! Stop!

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.768
You're hurting her. Stop!

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:07.946
Let her go.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.751
Let her go.

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:21.159
You're hurting her.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.950
Come on. Get up!

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:49.957
Shit!

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:52.755
This way.

This way. Hurry up!

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:58.658
Follow him.

Quick! Come on, climb!

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:14.776
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:26.753
Clem...

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:09.956
Don't hit me.
I didn't do anything!

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:13.763
We just want to play!

01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:15.461
Why won't you let us?
Let us!

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:18.968
Will you let us?

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:27.748
She's this way. Hurry!

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:58.745
This way!

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:04.460
