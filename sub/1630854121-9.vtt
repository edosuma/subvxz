Experience the residents most
heart pounding season yet.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.307
Fixing things is my job.

00:06.440 --> 00:10.478
See all new episodes Tuesday and
check out our other Fox shows.

00:10.611 --> 00:15.483
Monarch the Cleaning Lady
and 9/11 only on Fox.

00:17.485 --> 00:20.988
<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

00:21.089 --> 00:22.590
<i>Babies cry, Padma.</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:23.857
<i>Just hold them
as much as you can.</i>

00:23.957 --> 00:24.692
It's just hard,
do you understand?

00:25.993 --> 00:28.196
This isn't about your
emotional fortitude.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.530
It's about your MS.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.532
The stress is bad for you.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.367
The twins aren't even crawling,

00:33.501 --> 00:35.203
and I'm terrified
for them already.

00:35.303 --> 00:38.172
Never truly realized how fragile
they are until I held my own

00:38.272 --> 00:39.707
flesh and blood in my arms.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.209
You know, you're not really
selling the parenthood

00:41.309 --> 00:43.477
- thing here.
- Thank God I don't have twins.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.878
That's not helping
either, Hawkins.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.054
A little fuel to start the day.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.724
Ugh. Does it come in an IV?

00:56.857 --> 00:59.460
I was up all night.
Neighbor had a party.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.163
Nothing like EDM
blasting through the walls

01:02.163 --> 01:03.397
to lull you to sleep.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.233
- Who said I was trying to sleep?
- Hmm?

01:05.366 --> 01:08.902
I got right in there and
taught those fools the wobble.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.171
Hey...

01:11.339 --> 01:12.706
Hello, I'm not ordering

01:12.806 --> 01:14.408
French fries here.
Can I get some damn help?

01:14.542 --> 01:15.876
What do we think, ATV accident

01:15.976 --> 01:17.411
- or cow tipping gone wrong?
- Help, doctor.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.980
Uh, $20 these two
make their own fireworks.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.849
Thank you.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.752
Hi, I'm Dr. Feldman.
This is Nurse Hundley.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.487
- What happened?
- Uh, my buddy Wolf here

01:26.587 --> 01:27.921
is in a little bit of pain,
that's all.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.557
Okay, we'll take care of him,
and your name?

01:29.657 --> 01:32.092
- Cricket.
- All right, Wolf and Cricket.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.598
Let's get you checked out.

01:37.731 --> 01:38.732
Don't need an exam.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.334
Just...

01:40.434 --> 01:41.769
just something for the pain.

01:41.869 --> 01:42.836
Hmm.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.738
Well, I can't prescribe

01:44.838 --> 01:47.175
any medication
without a full exam.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.210
So, where exactly

01:49.210 --> 01:51.111
is this pain?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.280
All over.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.215
Looks like you've got some blood
on your arm.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.716
Let us take a look.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.186
He don't like
to be touched.

01:58.286 --> 02:01.689
Well, then we're not gonna get
very far today.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.625
Told you. This was a bad idea.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.059
Let's go somewhere else.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.095
- Hold on...
- Do not touch me!

02:08.196 --> 02:10.798
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.233
What's going on here?

02:12.233 --> 02:13.767
Well, they won't let us leave.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.470
If you let us take a look
at your arm,

02:16.570 --> 02:18.105
we'll give you something
for the pain.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.244
All right.

02:23.244 --> 02:26.046
Come on, take a seat.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.815
Lie down.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.123
CONRAD
Ooh...

02:36.224 --> 02:37.591
That looks like it hurts.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.960
- It does.
- Yeah?

02:40.060 --> 02:42.296
Okay, what did this to you?

02:42.396 --> 02:44.164
Nothing.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.999
A cat.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.501
Maine Coon.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.570
Big sucker.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.972
- Must've been ginormous.
- Yes, sir.

02:52.072 --> 02:56.009
40 pounder. We don't call her
Girlzilla for nothing.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.782
Good morning.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.351
The cavalry has arrived.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.253
Hey, hey, little fellas.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.455
Mama's getting you all
squeaky clean, huh?

03:07.455 --> 03:10.491
Trying.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.092
I got them wristbands

03:12.192 --> 03:14.695
because they're so hard
to tell apart,

03:14.795 --> 03:16.430
especially at this age.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.866
Hey, I'll tag in.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.105
I can't believe the sitter
bailed last-minute.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.941
- Maybe I should stay home.
- Hey.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.378
No, that is nonsense, Padma.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.146
You have been overwhelmed
for months, and you deserve

03:33.146 --> 03:35.683
the day off.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.818
Thanks.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.220
Oh, I just want to feel
like myself again.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.556
Hopefully,
this self-care day does it.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.394
I really appreciate you
stepping up.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.961
I know today's a big day
for you.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.332
Hey, no worries. I have a
couple hours before the surgery,

03:51.332 --> 03:52.733
and Chastain nursery

03:52.866 --> 03:54.134
will take them.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.069
I'm sure they'll like it there.

03:58.372 --> 04:01.342
I'll be back by 8:00.
Oh, and, um,

04:01.342 --> 04:04.011
Elijah is the green wristband,
and Arjun is the blue.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.747
Got it.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.551
Oh...

04:10.651 --> 04:13.821
Maybe, uh...

04:18.826 --> 04:21.261
Hey, Padma.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.960
Wow. Sam, this is amazing.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.195
Another hour, and your patient

04:55.295 --> 04:57.130
will have a brand-new
titanium ribcage

04:57.264 --> 04:59.032
tailored to fit her chest wall.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.234
And this only took
three days to build.

05:01.234 --> 05:04.772
Well, at Inman Park Tech,
we make the impossible possible.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.274
Well, if anyone deserves it,
it's-it's Tessa.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.710
She was one of my
clinical trial patients,

05:09.810 --> 05:13.080
and sadly, the meds didn't work,

05:13.080 --> 05:15.148
and so the cancer
spread to her ribs.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.817
If the surgery goes well today,

05:16.950 --> 05:19.086
this could be the start
of a new life for her.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.822
And the beginning
of a beautiful new partnership

05:21.922 --> 05:24.157
between Inman Park Tech
and Chastain.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.726
You know, I have to be honest,

05:25.826 --> 05:27.661
Dr. Pravesh,
I was skeptical about doing

05:27.761 --> 05:29.229
business with Chastain.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.931
Everyone knows you're
about to get your funding cut.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.600
Don't count us out.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.735
We're fighting hard to stay in
business, while still delivering

05:34.835 --> 05:37.270
care with the same level
of excellence.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.339
You see, that spunk right there
is why we decided

05:39.440 --> 05:40.674
to support Chastain

05:40.774 --> 05:42.976
in being the first hospital
in America to implant

05:43.076 --> 05:44.578
a titanium ribcage.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.247
- Ah, come over here.
- Hey, Sam.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.850
- Dr. Pravesh, this is Gina.
- Hi.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.620
- She's making a documentary
about our lab.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.988
They've already received
early interest from Sundance.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.357
Yeah, now it's just about
finding a great story,

05:57.458 --> 05:59.259
and Sam thinks
your patient has one.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.130
We'd like Gina and her crew to
film the implantation surgery.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.798
Um...

06:06.266 --> 06:08.201
Well, I would need
to get clearance first

06:08.335 --> 06:10.438
and the consent
of the patient, of course.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.206
It would be great publicity
for us both,

06:13.340 --> 06:15.543
and you'd be getting
the word out that Chastain

06:15.643 --> 06:17.144
is still
a cutting-edge hospital.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.782
All right, um,
let me see what I can do.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.785
Great.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.390
So, I have some good news.
I just spoke with Dr. Pravesh,

06:30.524 --> 06:34.495
and your surgery
will definitely happen today.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.497
Oh,

06:36.497 --> 06:38.566
Dr. Pravesh is an angel.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.301
Your titanium ribs will be here
within the hour.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.703
Wow.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.572
A titanium rib cage.

06:44.705 --> 06:48.476
Will they let me through TSA?

06:48.576 --> 06:50.978
I'm worried.
We thought the last surgery

06:51.078 --> 06:53.747
- would fix everything.
- Oh, please,

06:53.881 --> 06:55.849
don't question
the doctors, Wendy.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.585
They made no promises
when they operated.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.920
- It wasn't a cure-all.
- No,

07:00.053 --> 07:01.755
it's-it's okay.
After the trial failed,

07:01.855 --> 07:04.758
Dr. Austin and I succeeded
in removing the sarcoma

07:04.892 --> 07:06.259
from your mom's chest wall,

07:06.359 --> 07:08.261
breast,
and the affected ribs, but

07:08.361 --> 07:10.163
it left her lungs

07:10.263 --> 07:12.265
and her heart
without protection.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.868
I don't have much
of a choice, dear.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.670
It has to be done.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.506
We have to replace them.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.273
Well, the surgery is risky,

07:20.373 --> 07:22.610
I won't lie.
A full implantation

07:22.710 --> 07:24.377
of 3D printed ribs like this
has only been done

07:24.377 --> 07:27.280
once before, but we have
a multidisciplinary team

07:27.380 --> 07:28.949
of experts ready
to make that happen

07:29.082 --> 07:30.450
as safely as possible.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.554
Will Dr. Austin be joining you
in the surgery?

07:33.554 --> 07:36.356
Yes, of course.
He should be here soon.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.795
What's wrong with him, doc?

07:41.929 --> 07:44.532
Lacerations, fever,

07:44.632 --> 07:46.867
pain in the right
upper area of his belly.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.970
Gonna order some labs and get
a CT of his abdomen to find out.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.305
Cat-scratch fever is at the top

07:52.439 --> 07:54.808
of our list, assuming it really

07:54.908 --> 07:57.611
was a Maine Coon
that mauled you.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.446
It was a cat, okay?

07:59.547 --> 08:00.981
"A cat."

08:01.114 --> 08:02.883
Interesting word choice.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.218
I need to impress on you
how important it is

08:05.318 --> 08:07.721
you tell us the truth.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.222
We can't diagnose and treat you

08:09.322 --> 08:11.158
if we don't have
the right information.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.564
Talk to me.
Our ribs, how do they look?

08:16.664 --> 08:19.232
Futuristic, like something
out of a Marvel movie.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.934
Tessa's in great spirits.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.670
Her daughter, little less so.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.805
She watched her mom
struggle long enough.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.506
Tessa's husband died tragically,

08:26.607 --> 08:28.976
my trial failed her,
then cancer,

08:29.076 --> 08:30.310
and now, she needs new ribs.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.479
This poor woman, she's suffered.

08:32.580 --> 08:36.116
Then let's hope this surgery
is a win for her.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.284
Actually,
there's something

08:37.284 --> 08:38.686
that I need to run by you.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.287
A documentary crew

08:40.287 --> 08:42.956
has been following the
robotics lab at Inman Park Tech,

08:42.956 --> 08:46.459
and... they want to film

08:46.459 --> 08:48.028
Tessa's surgery.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.362
That's a big ask.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.131
There are liability issues
and privacy, too,

08:51.131 --> 08:52.600
- for Tessa.
- And will we have

08:52.700 --> 08:55.268
any creative say in how
Chastain is represented?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.504
I imagine we will not.

08:57.605 --> 09:00.440
Then, there's your answer.
I'm sorry, Devon, hard pass.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.611
Respectfully, Dr. Voss,
this is a once

09:03.711 --> 09:05.879
in a lifetime opportunity,
and if it all goes well,

09:05.979 --> 09:07.380
it could put Chastain
back on top.

09:07.514 --> 09:10.317
This documentary could be
very good publicity for us.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.720
Well, a-and if not, it could
have the opposite effect.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.555
We... we'd need creative say,
pending the outcome.

09:15.656 --> 09:19.326
Okay. We make it very clear
that we need creative say,

09:19.326 --> 09:20.961
or we don't move forward
with the documentary.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.697
Under those circumstances,
I'll allow it,

09:23.797 --> 09:25.532
but you're in charge, Devon.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.400
Don't let a camera crew
get in the way

09:27.500 --> 09:29.236
of achieving the best outcome
for our patient.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.305
- Okay.
- Dr. Voss.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.243
Could I have a word?

09:39.847 --> 09:42.916
Have you seen the front page
of the <i>Atlanta Metro Daily?</i>

09:43.016 --> 09:45.986
It's about Bell,
and it is not good.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.167
It's despicable. Anonymous
sources. Gutter journalism.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.401
This has Governor Betz's
fingerprints

10:01.501 --> 10:03.236
- all over it.
- But is it true?

10:03.336 --> 10:06.006
There are nuggets of truth,
but it's blown

10:06.106 --> 10:07.340
way out of proportion.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.942
Well,
I heard that, long ago,

10:09.042 --> 10:10.210
the staff used to call him

10:10.210 --> 10:13.180
HODAD, Hands of Death
and Destruction.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.348
He operated
when he shouldn't have,

10:15.448 --> 10:17.284
when he had a physical problem.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.053
He's a different man now,
a different doctor.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.855
Well, they sure made
his MS an issue.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.624
Randolph has some of the
best outcomes in the hospital.

10:24.758 --> 10:28.028
He's top of his field.
I have total faith in him.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.130
He has a rib implantation
in a few hours.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.464
What are you going to do?

10:33.300 --> 10:36.737
The implantation
is high profile.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.272
The publicity will be good
for Randolph's image

10:39.372 --> 10:40.741
when he's successful.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.409
And what if it isn't?

10:44.611 --> 10:46.980
I have to believe
in our surgeons.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.049
Until then,

10:49.149 --> 10:52.319
I do damage control.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.625
Wolf's lab results are in.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.961
Positive for
severe pancreatitis,

11:01.061 --> 11:03.330
but negative
for cat-scratch fever.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.398
Which means his symptoms
aren't caused

11:05.498 --> 11:06.834
by whatever scratched him
on the arm.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.101
Definitely not.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.402
Well, I'll start him on fluids,

11:09.502 --> 11:10.838
make sure his pain
is under control.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.605
And I'll send off
some more labs.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.608
I think he has
an exotic cat at home.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.278
Yeah, with scratches like that,
it makes the most sense.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.480
Well, no one's gonna confess
to a crime that easily.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.115
We'll have to pull the truth
out of 'em.

11:22.115 --> 11:25.118
I need you two in here, now!

11:31.458 --> 11:34.327
Pulmonary edema. The
pancreatitis is getting worse.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.796
Getting him on oxygen.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.297
Wolf, I'm done playing.
Tell me what's going on.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.866
You need to tell us. Now.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.636
Two of lorazepam
and get me an intubation kit.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.144
Can't you just
make an exception?

11:51.144 --> 11:52.880
Chastain recently changed
their policies.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.849
We can no longer accept babies
under ten months.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.651
Laura, I am needed
for a groundbreaking surgery.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.288
Help me out here, please.
Just for a few hours.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.991
Dr. Austin, I wish I could,
but there are rules,

12:03.991 --> 12:06.960
and violating them is gonna put
Chastain in legal jeopardy.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.862
I'm really sorry.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.664
Right.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.371
Make sure they get
my good side, Dr. Pravesh.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.640
All sides of you
are good, Tessa.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.577
I want to go on record.

12:24.677 --> 12:27.480
I think this documentary
is a bad idea.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.150
It could only distract
everyone in surgery.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.385
Listen, if there are any issues
at all, I will pull the plug.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.720
That is a promise.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.588
Your mom is the priority.

12:35.688 --> 12:36.756
Always.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.359
Okay.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.661
Thanks.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.699
I come bearing ribs.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.068
Let's get you in.
Come on, come on.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.436
We need to get this.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.272
Wow. I really will be
the bionic woman.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.008
Yeah. So, this

12:55.108 --> 12:56.276
will be your new sternum,

12:56.409 --> 12:58.111
and these curved pieces
will replace

12:58.245 --> 13:00.113
the ribs that we removed.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.682
They're beautiful.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.617
So, historically,

13:04.717 --> 13:07.187
patients like Tessa ended up
with a flat metal plate

13:07.287 --> 13:10.190
to cover their vital organs,
which might've kept them safe,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.359
but also left them
unable to move.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.294
So, their ability
to live full lives

13:14.394 --> 13:15.795
was drastically curtailed.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.065
But all that changes now
with Tessa.

13:18.065 --> 13:21.401
With these new ribs,
we'll give her full mobility

13:21.401 --> 13:23.270
and a new life.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.805
Isn't there another surgeon?
I would love

13:25.906 --> 13:27.707
to get a profile on him
and his consent to film.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.077
Yes, Dr. Austin,
he'll be the lead surgeon.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.778
He's triple board-certified.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.881
He's got nerves of steel
and great hands,

13:33.981 --> 13:35.315
and he is arguably

13:35.448 --> 13:37.650
the best cardiothoracic surgeon
in the nation.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.219
And a new father.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.820
Oh, here he is.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.156
Hey, uh, my apologies.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.326
Sitter cancelled. What's this?

13:46.426 --> 13:49.062
Um, these guys
are filming the surgery

13:49.162 --> 13:50.663
as part of a documentary.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.832
Um, have you sorted out
your childcare?

13:52.966 --> 13:55.969
I've been calling Padma,
she's not been answering.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.005
I'm still working it out. Hey.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.407
Tessa, I read your report,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.175
and your pre-op exam is clear.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.478
You are as healthy as possible
and ready for surgery.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.348
You have any questions
before we take you to the OR?

14:14.754 --> 14:17.290
The article is
a political smear job

14:17.290 --> 14:19.526
by a governor trying
to destroy Dr. Bell

14:19.626 --> 14:21.161
because he dared
speak truth to power.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.630
Yes, he's my husband,

14:23.630 --> 14:25.365
and I couldn't be more proud
of him at this moment.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.434
That's all I'm going to say.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.705
Dr. Stanley.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.308
I wasn't expecting to hear from
you till our next board meeting.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.778
Oh, come on. It's slander.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.381
- You and I both know
that Randolph is a specta...
- Ma'am, you can't go in there.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.316
I'm gonna have to call you back.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.385
You're Kit Voss,
the CEO of the hospital?

14:45.518 --> 14:47.120
The person in charge?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.188
I tried to stop her.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.023
It's all right, Tabitha.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.224
I am.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.693
My mother is Tessa Perez.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.296
She's about to have
her chest cracked open

14:56.396 --> 14:58.065
for this dangerous
new operation.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.067
Okay.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.037
I'm here to help you.
Tell me what's wrong.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.474
I read the article online.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.709
You can't possibly let
some butcher

15:09.809 --> 15:11.411
do this operation on my mom.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.213
These allegations are false.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.847
Remember, Dr. Bell was the one

15:14.847 --> 15:17.084
who successfully removed
your mother's cancer

15:17.184 --> 15:18.418
just weeks ago.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.353
Yeah, after the
Chastain clinical trial

15:20.353 --> 15:21.854
should've cured it.

15:21.854 --> 15:24.357
Clinical trials are experiments.
There are no guarantees.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.527
And this is also experimental.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.262
Maybe this could kill her.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.498
I'm sure you were both told

15:31.598 --> 15:34.501
the risks are high,
but so are the rewards.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.237
I'm-I'm sorry, but your mother
is out of options.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.771
She chose this.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.442
Then get her another doctor.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.513
I would trust my life
to Dr. Bell.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.382
I'd want him if I were
going into this surgery

15:49.382 --> 15:51.384
- your mother is facing.
- You're his wife!

15:52.619 --> 15:54.787
You're not impartial.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.625
Look, my mom is my best friend.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.793
Okay? She's the kindest
person I know,

16:00.927 --> 16:04.797
and she's too trusting.
I have to be careful for her.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.101
I've watched her suffer
long enough.

16:09.569 --> 16:13.373
From now on, I protect her.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.480
Either Dr. Bell is out,

16:20.580 --> 16:22.815
or we are.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.108
You're taking me off
the surgery, aren't you?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.642
I'm sorry,

16:49.742 --> 16:51.944
but the patient's
daughter insists.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.181
No, I heard about
the article, and...

16:54.281 --> 16:57.150
well, I get that it's a risk
to Chastain. The...

16:57.250 --> 17:00.420
cameras running, a...
surgeon who's been publicly

17:00.520 --> 17:01.921
outed as incompetent.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.624
You can't be allowed
to do a high-risk operation

17:04.624 --> 17:06.259
- on a patient.
- It's quite possible that even

17:06.359 --> 17:08.695
your best effort could still
result in a failed outcome.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.531
No, it's-it's clear
what we have to do.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.935
- I'm out.
- You don't deserve this.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.206
You are a brilliant surgeon
and even better man.

17:19.339 --> 17:23.343
We're in a war with Betz, and
he launched a nuclear weapon.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.811
We're gonna fight it.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.045
Okay.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.117
Hands of Death and Destruction. HODAD.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.352
Now,

17:32.452 --> 17:34.487
what can I do to help?

17:35.788 --> 17:37.790
Well, AJ can't do
the surgery on his own.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.160
There's no one I trust
more than you.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.562
Can you step in for me?

17:42.695 --> 17:43.963
Of course.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.366
I'm familiar
with what was planned.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.568
Okay, good, good,
so I'll-I'll run through

17:48.668 --> 17:50.637
the specifics with you
so you are ready.

17:50.737 --> 17:55.308
<i>MAN (over P.A.):
r. Lopez, come to the pharmacyD
for a consult.</i>

17:55.408 --> 17:57.477
<i>Dr. Lopez to the pharmacy...</i>

18:01.714 --> 18:03.750
Your friend is dying.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.186
You need to tell us
what did this,

18:06.186 --> 18:08.054
or we can't save him.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.592
Well, the truth is we...

18:12.692 --> 18:15.428
we get kicked,
bit, and scratched

18:15.528 --> 18:18.198
all the time by a lot of things.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.600
Kicked? Bit?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.602
- By what?
- We, um...

18:24.337 --> 18:25.838
We have a home zoo.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.709
That, uh,
the show about that guy

18:29.709 --> 18:32.679
who made a great living
raising tigers

18:32.779 --> 18:35.114
made a big impression.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.189
You know it didn't end well
for him, right?

18:42.289 --> 18:44.291
He's famous.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.592
He's in prison for murder.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.795
Okay.
What's your point?

18:48.928 --> 18:49.929
How do you not understand
the danger

18:50.029 --> 18:51.231
you're putting yourselves in?

18:51.231 --> 18:54.634
Wild animals can carry
many diseases,

18:54.767 --> 18:55.735
not to mention maul you.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.570
Hey, people pay big money

18:57.570 --> 19:00.540
to pet a king cobra,
feed an ape, take a photo

19:00.640 --> 19:02.141
next to an African lion.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.610
We're animal lovers,

19:03.710 --> 19:05.778
- I swear.
- What you're doing is illegal.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.415
Your friend's on a vent.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.916
He's hanging on by a thread.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.255
Okay. What-- what can I do?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.290
What savaged his arm?

19:17.390 --> 19:19.992
That was a lion. Maude.

19:20.126 --> 19:23.162
She's normally real gentle,
but, uh, we got careless.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.897
Okay, finally
we're getting someplace.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.499
What else could've bitten
or scratched him?

19:26.599 --> 19:28.901
We got so many animals.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.837
It... it could've been
any of them.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.573
Well, then you and I
are gonna make a list.

20:40.873 --> 20:44.010
Oh.

20:44.010 --> 20:47.013
- Hey.
- Aw, look at those cheeks.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.015
Mm. Just the babies
I wanted to see.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.050
Oh, that's great, Hundley.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.252
That's just the reaction
the three of us were hoping for.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.087
Listen, I hit a bit

20:55.187 --> 20:57.990
of a logistical snafu,
and I need a babysitter.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.659
Billie already gave me
a heads-up. I'll take one.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.395
- Hand him over.
- Thank you.
One is a great start.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.865
Yeah. (grunts) That's why
God made two hands.

21:05.865 --> 21:10.670
One for charting,
and one for snuggling.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.005
Wait. Is this Elijah or Arjun?

21:13.105 --> 21:17.109
Well, we also had a mishap
with the wristbands

21:17.243 --> 21:20.112
and the tub so I'm not quite
sure who's who at the moment.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.214
- Mm-hmm.
- But do not judge.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.183
Even Mommy has trouble
telling them apart.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.953
Having a baby with a friend
complicates everything.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.589
Two of them
is another level entirely.

21:29.689 --> 21:33.059
Or did you miss that in the
parenting instructional manual?

21:33.059 --> 21:35.762
Uh, there's a parenting
instruction manual?

21:35.862 --> 21:37.730
Hey, Feldman!

21:37.730 --> 21:39.632
You are great with the boys,

21:39.732 --> 21:41.801
they love you,
and I need childcare.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.736
Oh, of course.
Hundred bucks an hour.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.905
Done! Thank you, my man.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.708
He was gonna do that for free.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.554
Pancreatitis,

22:01.654 --> 22:04.090
delirium, seizures.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.092
None of Wolf's symptoms
are consistent

22:06.092 --> 22:08.294
with injuries caused
by any animals on this list.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.129
There's got
to be something else.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.164
No, that-that's all the
big animals we got, I swear it.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.434
All the big animals?
You got any small ones?

22:14.434 --> 22:16.803
Oh, we-we got critters, but
Wolf mostly takes care of 'em.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.071
You know, snakes,
spiders, scorpions.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.574
Ugh. You are
killing me here, man.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.010
You didn't think it would be
useful to mention this earlier?

22:24.143 --> 22:26.012
It's a side hustle.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.647
By the way,
you would not believe

22:27.747 --> 22:29.081
what some dude in China will pay

22:29.181 --> 22:30.617
for a little
Brazilian scorpion venom.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.952
Hurts to milk 'em, though.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.787
And they bite.
Stings like a bitch.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.523
Brazilian scorpions?

22:36.623 --> 22:39.792
<i>Tityniae serrulatus,</i>
to be specific.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.364
Tityustoxin.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.768
Was Wolf, by chance, siphoning
the venom this morning?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.170
I hope so.
We got a deadline to meet.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.672
That's it.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.273
Where you going?

22:54.373 --> 22:56.208
Tityustoxin
from the scorpion venom

22:56.308 --> 22:57.710
was causing Wolf's pancreas

22:57.844 --> 22:59.446
to inflame
and auto-digest itself.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.548
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means

23:01.681 --> 23:04.451
your business partner
needs antivenom, or he dies.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.692
Hey, what's taking Bell so long?
He should be here by now.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.727
I've taken him off the surgery.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.729
Because of the article?

23:16.863 --> 23:19.065
I'm stepping in for him.

23:19.165 --> 23:22.669
Well, I'm disappointed for Bell,
but I'm good with it.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.804
Pravesh?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.239
Given the circumstance,
it's the best option we have.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.408
Aah!

23:30.176 --> 23:32.745
Hey, what's wrong? Talk to me.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.747
My back. The pain.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.850
And-and my legs-- they're numb.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.754
- Keep rolling.
- What's going on?

23:41.854 --> 23:43.022
Is she okay?

23:43.022 --> 23:44.924
New lower extremity weakness.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.726
Cauda equina syndrome.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.428
- What does that mean?
- We need to go now!

23:49.529 --> 23:50.863
I'll meet you in the OR.

23:50.863 --> 23:51.931
Go, go. Go!

23:52.064 --> 23:54.266
- Anybody?!
- Wendy. Wendy.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.202
What's going on?

23:56.202 --> 23:58.605
We have to get your mother
to the OR now.

23:58.738 --> 24:01.073
She has a serious complication
that we have to deal with first.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.274
- Come on.
- We have to stabilize her

24:02.408 --> 24:03.743
before we can implant the ribs.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.277
I can't promise you

24:05.377 --> 24:07.446
that the rib surgery
is gonna happen today.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.396
How did we not see this
in imaging?

24:24.396 --> 24:26.132
We couldn't have.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.067
The cancer must have
metastasized rapidly

24:28.067 --> 24:31.137
during her time in the ICU,
even between scans.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.874
What's going on?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.810
Our patient has
a dangerous complication.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.411
Should we be filming?

24:39.411 --> 24:43.282
No, this has nothing to do
with the rib implantation.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.120
What are the odds that Tessa's
story has a happy ending now?

24:48.220 --> 24:51.057
A lot less
than they were this morning.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.293
We're losing nerve signal.

24:54.393 --> 24:55.895
The tumor has eroded the bone.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.565
Pathologic spinal fracture
leading to cord compression.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.067
All right, if we don't get rid
of this tumor,

25:01.167 --> 25:03.169
new set of ribs
aren't gonna make a difference.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.171
You're right.
She needs a decompression.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.339
Should I page Billie?

25:07.439 --> 25:08.675
Right away.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.244
Our neurosurgeon is on the way.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.013
You can go.
We won't be filming any more.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.348
I'm thinking
that this is great stuff.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.150
- You know, conflict is drama.
- No.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.152
There's a woman down there
whose life hangs in the balance.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.188
Filming it would be
a distraction.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.156
I'm not gonna let you continue.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.458
The patient comes first.

25:27.794 --> 25:31.664
Okay, but you're missing out
on a golden opportunity.

25:33.465 --> 25:37.203
I'm sorry, but please leave.

25:39.772 --> 25:42.675
<i>The vertebrae is crumbling.</i>

25:42.775 --> 25:44.877
<i>Any word on Billie, Pravesh?</i>

25:44.977 --> 25:47.213
She's coming.

25:47.346 --> 25:50.049
<i>Well, she better hurry.</i>

26:02.629 --> 26:04.130
What have we got?

26:04.230 --> 26:06.365
An emergent
spinal decompression.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.167
When did you lose

26:08.167 --> 26:09.802
SSEPs to the lower extremities?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.138
Five minutes ago.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.406
Time is spine.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.909
All right, osteotome to me.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.056
Hi. Sam, how are you?

26:30.156 --> 26:32.224
What the hell is going on
over there, Pravesh?

26:33.025 --> 26:36.195
There's been an unforeseen
complication with the surgery.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.230
I'm not talking
about the surgery.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.032
I'm talking about this article.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.734
<i>The article-- It...</i>

26:41.834 --> 26:45.037
It's a mixture of exaggeration
and outright lies.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.239
You told me
Chastain was the best.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.841
This guy, Dr. Bell--

26:48.941 --> 26:50.743
- he's on Tessa's medical team.
<i>- Well, not anymore.</i>

26:50.843 --> 26:51.911
We-we took him off the surgery.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.112
If the article's a lie,

26:53.245 --> 26:54.213
why would you take him off
the case?

26:54.213 --> 26:55.347
It's either one or the other.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.883
<i>Well, at this point, it's moot</i>

26:56.883 --> 26:58.517
because we don't even know
if we can move forward.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.220
And if you can, who operates?

27:01.220 --> 27:03.055
<i>Dr. Voss. She's our CEO.</i>

27:03.055 --> 27:05.624
Top ortho surgeon. She can
do it. There's no one better.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.227
<i>But Sam,
here won't be any more filming.t</i>

27:08.227 --> 27:10.730
Fine. I can live with that.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.865
<i>We've worked so hard,
t's too late to pull the plug.i</i>

27:12.965 --> 27:14.466
But Inman Park Tech

27:14.566 --> 27:16.736
better come out of this
looking like rock stars.

27:16.736 --> 27:19.571
If not,
our new partnership is over.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.549
Hey, I got your page.
How bad is it?

27:30.649 --> 27:31.984
Um, unclear.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.953
Apparently, one of Conrad's
patients was stung repeatedly

27:34.053 --> 27:37.289
by a scorpion and developed
severe pancreatitis.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.260
I think I speak for
the whole hospital when I say,

27:41.260 --> 27:43.796
we know how good you are,
and we're all behind you.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.331
Well, I appreciate that.

27:45.431 --> 27:48.667
You taught me so much.
This will pass.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.837
I hope so.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.106
All right, so, here's the deal.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.908
I dosed him with antivenom.

27:56.008 --> 27:59.111
But he's already developing
necrotizing pancreatitis.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.679
With worsening
organ dysfunction.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.915
His urine output's trailing off,
he's tough to ventilate.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.351
- What's his
bladder pressure?
- Mid-20s.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.853
He's got
abdominal compartment syndrome.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.988
If the pressure
in his abdomen gets any higher,

28:09.088 --> 28:10.356
he's-he's gonna go into shock.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.024
Well, he needs a laparotomy.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.592
- Should I book an OR?
- Um, no, not yet.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.427
We need to maximize
medical management first.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.363
Let's start with paracentesis,

28:17.463 --> 28:19.866
drain the fluid at bedside
and then reassess.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.534
Okay, I'll prepare
the paracentesis now.

28:28.607 --> 28:32.378
As an internist, I appreciate
the nonsurgical approach,

28:32.511 --> 28:34.380
but is this you
or the article talking?

28:34.513 --> 28:36.182
This is about the patient.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.951
I-I... I know you might find it
hard to believe,

28:39.051 --> 28:43.489
considering that nickname has
come back to haunt me, but I...

28:45.024 --> 28:46.725
I am long past the days

28:46.859 --> 28:50.462
of letting outside influence
dictate the way I do my job.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.821
There's a ton of ascites fluid
in his abdomen.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.255
No wonder he's so distended.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.891
Yeah, there's quite a bit.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.361
Well, do you want
to do the procedure?

29:22.361 --> 29:24.096
Technically,
Conrad consulted you.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.098
Uh, nope, nope.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.700
You can handle it.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.855
Spinal cord is decompressed.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.422
The tumor is resected.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.791
And our nerve signal
is back, but weak.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.294
Now we have
to stabilize the spine,

29:55.427 --> 29:57.930
rebuild it,
vertebrae by vertebrae.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.731
I'm trying.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.367
These screws won't hold.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.803
Her bones must have been
compromised from the tumor.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.439
We have to fuse more levels.

30:07.539 --> 30:10.776
But I'm not sure
if Tessa can hold up.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.147
Her blood pressure's dropping.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.482
She's going into A-fib.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.617
We need more IV fluids,

30:18.717 --> 30:20.920
and we need
another amio bolus ready.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.266
Hey, Doc?!

30:34.266 --> 30:37.136
His blood pressure's low.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.141
And his abdomen is tense.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.143
Paracentesis wasn't enough.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.512
- Can you do it again, or...?
- It won't solve the problem.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.982
He's too sick.
Hamad, page Bell and Devi.

30:50.082 --> 30:53.252
Have 'em meet us in the OR now.

31:03.029 --> 31:05.197
Spinal fusion is a success.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.766
Thanks
to our brilliant neurosurgeon,

31:07.866 --> 31:08.834
<i>Tessa is stable.</i>

31:08.935 --> 31:10.702
Yeah,
but is she stable enough

31:10.836 --> 31:12.171
to make it
through the rib implantation?

31:12.271 --> 31:13.605
That's for us to figure out.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.342
Dr. Sutton, we'll take it
from here. Thank you.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.377
I'll leave you to it.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.213
- Good luck, everyone.
- All right.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.015
<i>Let's close up her back.</i>

31:23.115 --> 31:26.785
<i>Now, do we proceed
with the implantation or...?</i>

31:26.885 --> 31:30.689
Or do we stop and give her
a rest from anesthesia,

31:30.789 --> 31:32.491
return to the ribs another day?

31:32.491 --> 31:35.294
Her A-fib hasn't recurred,
but if it does...

31:35.394 --> 31:37.063
<i>It's a risk.</i>

31:37.196 --> 31:39.966
<i>But every day without
hose ribs brings another risk.t</i>

31:40.066 --> 31:41.667
<i>Heart and lungs exposed.</i>

31:41.667 --> 31:43.235
<i>Pravesh,
you made this a reality.</i>

31:43.369 --> 31:46.038
<i>You know Tessa.
You make the call.</i>

31:48.374 --> 31:50.342
<i>Let's do it.</i>

31:53.879 --> 31:55.747
This is on me.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.583
I thought the paracentesis
would be enough.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.218
It was the right call,

31:59.318 --> 32:01.753
but now the compartment syndrome
is compressing his IVC.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.522
- We should go.
- There's not enough blood
getting to his heart.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.191
- Get your stuff.
- His MAPs are in the 40s.

32:05.191 --> 32:06.425
Hawkins, at-at this rate,

32:06.558 --> 32:07.926
he could code
before we get to the OR.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.029
Well, then he needs
a decompressive laparotomy

32:10.029 --> 32:12.098
right here, right now.

32:12.198 --> 32:14.400
Dr. Devi's on her way to the OR.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.735
I think it's best
we do it there.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.748
Listen to me. I knew that man

32:29.848 --> 32:32.084
they wrote about in that
article, and that's not you.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.885
Not now.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.121
I'm not so sure
about that anymore,

32:35.254 --> 32:36.188
for a number of reasons.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.689
I'd trust you with my life.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.625
After everything
we've been through,

32:39.725 --> 32:40.959
that has
to mean something to you

32:41.060 --> 32:42.628
because
it means something to me.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.530
I know you can save
this man's life right now.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.898
Come on. Let's do it.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.874
I need Betadine and a ten blade.

33:05.151 --> 33:08.754
No pulse.
Just hold off on compressions.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.060
Ten blade.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.413
He's got a pulse,
and it is strong.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.954
That was amazing, man!

33:42.954 --> 33:44.523
You see that?

33:44.623 --> 33:46.792
And we filmed all of it.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.694
Congrats, Dr. Bell.
You brought the drama.

33:48.827 --> 33:52.364
Wow. That was awesome.
I just, uh... I need...

33:52.498 --> 33:56.102
I just need you all
to sign a release,

33:56.202 --> 33:57.869
of course.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.706
Um, I'm not sure that...

34:00.839 --> 34:02.874
Footage doesn't lie.

34:02.974 --> 34:05.677
Amazing. So good.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.557
Let's rotate.

34:24.796 --> 34:28.234
Removing the prosthetic.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.576
All right.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.711
Ready to implant the titanium.

34:57.863 --> 35:00.098
Fits like a glove.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.069
She's back in A-fib

35:04.170 --> 35:06.772
and hypotensive.
We can bolus her amio again,

35:06.905 --> 35:09.208
- but we're running out of time.
- Let's bring this home.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.042
Attaching the ribs in place.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.607
<i>I mean,
it's like a piece of armor.</i>

35:41.707 --> 35:43.209
Utterly amazing.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.923
How's my mom?

35:57.923 --> 36:00.492
She came through beautifully.
What a fighter.

36:00.626 --> 36:01.927
The ribs fit perfectly.

36:01.927 --> 36:03.495
As you see,
the surgery was a long one.

36:03.595 --> 36:07.098
Recovery's going to be tough,
but we're optimistic.

36:07.098 --> 36:10.569
Okay. Thank you.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.739
Um, thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.741
I'm sorry
that I ever doubted you.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.343
It's not over yet.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.011
But we've done our best,
and now we'll do our best

36:20.111 --> 36:21.780
to make sure
she gets back on her feet

36:21.780 --> 36:24.683
and living her new life.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.854
- Thank you.
- Of course.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.881
Hmm.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.383
Hey.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.217
Irving and Hundley bailed?

36:59.351 --> 37:01.019
There was a multiple
injury crash,

37:01.119 --> 37:02.688
and they got overwhelmed
in the ER.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.824
I was leaving and
couldn't handle this cuteness,

37:05.824 --> 37:07.893
so I kidnapped them.

37:07.993 --> 37:10.329
Hey. Hey, little man.

37:10.329 --> 37:14.132
Aw. Did you miss Papa?

37:14.232 --> 37:17.569
You know,
I never held my son, Trevor.

37:17.703 --> 37:20.639
Well, you know, you were a child
yourself when he was born.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.408
Mm.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.844
Well, because of where
he came from, I didn't want to.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.246
Couldn't do it.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.082
This is what I missed, hmm?

37:31.216 --> 37:33.519
You know, you can still be
a great mom if you want to.

37:33.519 --> 37:37.423
- Mm.
- And hey, you found a way
to make a new bond with Trevor.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.157
Yeah, he's a good guy.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.593
He's working hard
to develop new drugs.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.895
Chemistry is his first passion,

37:43.995 --> 37:46.765
so he moved to Baltimore.

37:46.898 --> 37:49.100
- But we're still in touch.
- Mm-hmm.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.503
Mm, but this is something else.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.872
Oh, you got that right.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.942
These two bring me
a special kind of joy.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.745
Even when Elijah's just
staring daggers at me.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.347
Yeah.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.114
You know, I think he's hungry.

38:03.248 --> 38:06.084
Seems like you can
tell your twins apart after all.

38:06.184 --> 38:08.620
Ah, well, I forgot that
their distinguishing features

38:08.720 --> 38:10.622
are their personalities.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.692
Well, you're gonna have a lot of
fun watching these two grow up.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.294
They're gonna love their papa.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.397
Mm.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.532
I-I do not even know
what I'm feeling right now.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.134
Y-You should have been there,
right? Th-this doctor--

38:23.234 --> 38:25.070
he cut right into your stomach
right in the hallway.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.806
Your guts started oozing out
all over the place

38:27.906 --> 38:29.608
- like...
- Okay, okay, enough.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.309
Dr. Bell saved your life.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.580
You're going to need
another trip to the OR once

38:34.580 --> 38:37.583
your belly's less swollen to
get that abdominal wound closed,

38:37.583 --> 38:40.151
but you'll be okay.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.322
- How you feeling?
- Better.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.891
A lot better.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.293
You underestimated
that scorpion.

38:48.394 --> 38:50.796
Repeated exposure
to scorpion venom--

38:50.896 --> 38:52.831
yeah, that wreaks havoc
on your body.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.901
I feel like a damn fool.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.135
- It won't happen again.
- Good.

38:57.235 --> 38:58.136
Let this be a lesson
to you both.

38:58.236 --> 39:00.005
Don't lie to your doctors.

39:00.138 --> 39:01.473
We-we... we didn't lie.

39:01.573 --> 39:03.074
I mean, we just didn't tell
the whole truth.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.511
Yeah, which almost
got you killed.

39:05.611 --> 39:09.147
Well, w-we will take precautions
from now on, right?

39:09.247 --> 39:12.350
W-Wear gloves, be the safest
unauthorized zoo in the state.

39:12.451 --> 39:15.454
Trafficking in exotic animals is
illegal in the state of Georgia,

39:15.454 --> 39:17.423
and having any wild animal

39:17.523 --> 39:19.157
- requires a permit.
- Well,

39:19.257 --> 39:22.661
sure, but, I mean,
who's really paying attention?

39:22.761 --> 39:25.464
I am.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.638
Reported you both
to the state animal control.

39:32.638 --> 39:34.873
- Oh.
- Wait. What the hell, man?!

39:35.006 --> 39:36.708
Wh-What about
doctor-patient privilege?

39:36.808 --> 39:39.344
I didn't tell them anything
about your health history.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.283
Here you go.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.218
Pravesh?

39:47.318 --> 39:49.354
Congratulations.

39:49.455 --> 39:51.389
You have every right
to be proud of yourself.

39:51.523 --> 39:55.293
And you pulled off that surgery
like a boss, Voss.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.696
We proved something here.

39:57.796 --> 40:00.732
Huge leaps in medicine
can happen in unexpected places.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.400
- Yeah.
- Doctors?

40:02.501 --> 40:06.237
I hear the patient is
in recovery, doing beautifully.

40:06.371 --> 40:08.239
- Job well done.
- Thank you.

40:08.373 --> 40:10.676
And I can't wait to see
what Chastain

40:10.676 --> 40:12.811
and Inman Park Tech
partner on next.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.746
Me, too.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.048
Nice going, Pravesh.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.084
Still love your spunk.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.388
Spunk.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.665
I thought
we were meeting at home.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.433
Well, couldn't wait.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.068
Is something wrong?

40:37.168 --> 40:39.004
Oh, I told you
I wasn't gonna read the article.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.172
But of course you did.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.108
But I-I didn't finish.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.443
Um, my heart started racing,

40:45.577 --> 40:48.947
and there was a ringing
in my ears,

40:49.047 --> 40:50.582
and then the room started
to spin.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.417
Like an anxiety attack?

40:52.518 --> 40:54.119
It's the MS, Kit.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.454
It's probably made worse
from the stress.

40:56.588 --> 41:00.458
And it cleared up,
and I got through the day.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.528
But...

41:02.628 --> 41:05.130
it's not the only time since
I returned from the clinic.

41:05.263 --> 41:08.634
Well, let me see
if Conrad's still around.

41:08.734 --> 41:11.202
- He can examine you.
- Hey.

41:14.239 --> 41:17.408
I think we both know this is not
something Conrad can manage.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.311
And maybe it is the stress.

41:20.445 --> 41:24.983
But it... it could also be
side effects of my new meds.

41:26.217 --> 41:28.253
Oh, they worked for a while.

41:28.253 --> 41:31.289
Maybe they're not working
so well anymore.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.928
My MS could be progressing.

41:37.729 --> 41:41.266
Then we'll find another
treatment, a-a clinical trial.

41:47.438 --> 41:49.675
I think I need
to get back to Minnesota.

41:52.644 --> 41:55.513
Whatever you need,
you just say the word.

41:55.614 --> 41:59.618
All I want is you by my side,
whatever it takes.

42:15.433 --> 42:19.270
All right, home sweet home.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.774
Oh.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.710
Okay.

42:31.717 --> 42:36.054
Where... is Mommy, guys?

42:38.957 --> 42:41.492
I'll be right back.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.830
She's supposed
to be home by now.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.535
Padma?

43:01.680 --> 43:04.015
Padma?

43:11.757 --> 43:13.391
<i>Hi. You've reached Padma.
Leave a message.</i>
