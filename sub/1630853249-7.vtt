my traditional spiel,
unfortunately.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.714
My name is Rand Casimiro,

25:41.714 --> 25:46.022
and I am your mediator
for these proceedings.

25:46.022 --> 25:49.460
Now, I'm happy to be here,
but at the end, hopefully,

25:49.460 --> 25:50.897
all of you in the room

25:50.897 --> 25:55.379
and those listening
from various locations

25:55.379 --> 25:57.294
won't be happy with me.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.687
And why do I say that?

25:58.687 --> 26:02.996
Because the best solutions
mean compromise.

26:02.996 --> 26:06.216
It's compromise from both sides.
That's my goal.

26:06.216 --> 26:08.784
But as my wife
always says --

26:08.784 --> 26:11.395

I'm right and she's wrong.

with these negotiations today.

26:38.771 --> 26:42.731

beyond any of our control.

26:42.731 --> 26:44.559
Well, I'm going to
have to insist

26:44.559 --> 26:46.126
that you be
more specific.

26:48.258 --> 26:52.915

using the word "compromise"

26:52.915 --> 26:55.701
when he,in fact,
is compromised.

26:56.789 --> 26:57.833

26:57.833 --> 26:59.879
I think you heard me.

26:59.879 --> 27:02.098

27:02.098 --> 27:05.754

correct?

27:05.754 --> 27:07.060
I do.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.715
And this morning,
around 7:00 a.m.?

27:09.715 --> 27:11.978
You walked across
Trumbull park in town.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.284
No.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.504
You didn't stop
at the park this morning.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.549
I didn't.

27:18.549 --> 27:21.596
I got to Albuquerque early,
not at 7:00 a.m.

27:21.596 --> 27:24.338
And I didn't go
to a park.You're sure.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.079
Howard, if the judge says
he's sure, then I --

27:26.079 --> 27:28.037
Of course I'm sure.

27:28.037 --> 27:31.606
If it matters,
I arrived in town about 10:00.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.434
I stopped
at a gas station.

27:33.434 --> 27:36.089
I went by a liquor store
and bought a gift.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.961
I had a lunch salad
and a very nice latte

27:38.961 --> 27:41.921
from the Flying Star
on Menaul.

27:41.921 --> 27:44.053
I read Barron's.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.272
Then came here.

27:45.272 --> 27:46.969
Hamlin: Mm.

27:46.969 --> 27:48.101
So you weren't in town

27:48.101 --> 27:49.668
to visit
our mutual acquaintance,

27:49.668 --> 27:52.061
James Morgan McGill.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.889
Or maybe you know him
as "Saul Goodman."

27:55.151 --> 27:57.501
I don't know anyone
by either of those names.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.678
Okay.
You want to go that way?

28:01.549 --> 28:03.420
Julie, go to my desk,
please.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.161
There's an envelope...
with photos.

28:05.161 --> 28:06.597
Bring it to me,
quickly.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.469
O-Okay.

28:08.469 --> 28:09.949
Howard,
can we have a sidebar?

28:09.949 --> 28:13.604
I'm sorry, these photos.[Door opens]

what I'm describing.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.137

following Jimmy McGill.

28:24.137 --> 28:26.835
You were photographed receiving
what I estimate to be

28:26.835 --> 28:29.664
a $20,000 payoff
this morning in the park.

28:29.664 --> 28:32.928
I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, this is just...

28:32.928 --> 28:35.235

as a mediator, and we agreed,

things will be clearer.

he snuck in somehow, and...

that will be sorted out,

to take me down --You are blowing this.

a long, deep breath

32:27.510 --> 32:29.817

one set of photos,

after I left the office.

from our detective agency.

their contact info --

so, of course, she changed
the number in the system.

it wasn't them.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.353

to follow Jimmy,

32:46.921 --> 32:49.532
I called hisfake number
and hisfake man.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.665

the old number,

32:51.665 --> 32:54.233

got the actual agency.

had ever worked there.

win this.

even do this?
