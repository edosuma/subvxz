00:07.980 --> 00:09.150
(Episode 15)

00:38.350 --> 00:39.550
Secretary Kim?

00:56.929 --> 00:58.230
President Ha Ji Seung.

01:00.270 --> 01:01.399
This is a surprise.

01:02.539 --> 01:04.840
I thought you cut me off,

01:05.239 --> 01:07.039
but you wanted to\Nsee me first.

01:17.750 --> 01:21.720
(Queen of Mystery 2)

01:31.830 --> 01:33.169
- You can't come in here.\N- Mi Joo.

01:35.569 --> 01:36.569
Mi Joo.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.910
You didn't die, right?

01:39.910 --> 01:41.479
You didn't!

02:00.199 --> 02:01.660
They found her already?

02:04.130 --> 02:05.429
Darn it.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.679
Professor Ha,\Nthis is urgent.

02:18.110 --> 02:19.110
Get me...

02:20.820 --> 02:23.290
Get me in contact\Nwith Secretary Kim now.

02:25.089 --> 02:26.689
If you don't let me\Nmeet him now,

02:27.420 --> 02:28.990
you'll regret it.

02:33.529 --> 02:34.529
Professor Ha.

02:36.059 --> 02:37.170
This is Secretary Kim.

02:39.369 --> 02:40.869
I heard you need something\Ntaken care of.

02:42.839 --> 02:43.909
Professor Ha.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.679
Do you think I'm stupid?

02:48.140 --> 02:50.450
Secretary Kim can't be\Nthis young.

02:50.450 --> 02:52.610
You've known him\Nfor 17 years.

02:53.020 --> 02:54.050
Am I wrong?

02:56.719 --> 02:58.820
Secretary Kim never\Nshows himself.

02:58.890 --> 03:02.059
So persuade him for me.

03:04.629 --> 03:06.260
Don't look at me\Nlike that.

03:07.159 --> 03:09.499
You and I are\Nno different.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.830
Both you and I...

03:13.540 --> 03:15.300
are just trying to live,

03:15.839 --> 03:16.869
aren't we?

03:33.059 --> 03:34.619
You're good.

03:38.659 --> 03:40.730
You are good.

03:41.230 --> 03:44.029
Delicate lines\Nand accurate composition.

03:44.399 --> 03:46.599
You put a lot of time\Nand care into it.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.040
I majored in arts.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.110
You sure are talented.

03:51.670 --> 03:53.540
You're talented\Nat showing off...

03:53.540 --> 03:54.879
a useless talent.

03:55.710 --> 03:57.779
How much time\Ndid you waste on this?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.450
You could've taken...

03:59.450 --> 04:01.520
more than 500 pictures\Ninstead of drawing this.

04:02.379 --> 04:05.589
I was going to\Ntake pictures too.

04:08.890 --> 04:10.529
She acts like she's\Nin a drawing contest.

04:10.790 --> 04:12.260
Be nice, Mr. Hwang.

04:12.260 --> 04:13.800
Focus on your work.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.760
Why are you\Nhanging around here?

04:15.760 --> 04:16.829
Aren't you going to\Ninvestigate?

04:17.170 --> 04:18.499
It's a deserted place,

04:18.730 --> 04:21.170
but you can drive a car\Nclose to the site.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.210
There are tire tracks.

04:23.210 --> 04:24.440
Did you all see them?

04:27.810 --> 04:30.250
It looks like\Nhe was flustered.

04:30.250 --> 04:33.419
He probably didn't know\Nwhat to do with the body.

04:34.180 --> 04:35.479
How am I going to\Nclean this up?

04:36.690 --> 04:38.320
It's midterm season.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.960
The culprit\Nhas been here before.

04:45.289 --> 04:47.630
That means it wasn't\Na planned crime.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.799
Why did he leave\Nthe corpse here for days?

04:51.799 --> 04:53.669
He had enough time\Nto dispose it.

04:57.539 --> 04:59.440
He wanted to look at it\Nfor enjoyment.

05:10.989 --> 05:13.219
What? Look at what\Nfor enjoyment?

05:14.789 --> 05:15.789
The corpse.

05:16.729 --> 05:18.289
Why would you do that?

05:18.289 --> 05:19.830
He should've hidden it, so\Nthat it wouldn't be found.

05:19.830 --> 05:21.799
This is off\Nthe beaten path.

05:22.899 --> 05:25.070
But a lot of footprints\Nare on that spot.

05:25.270 --> 05:27.070
They're of the same size.

05:27.140 --> 05:29.669
So it's not easy...

05:29.669 --> 05:31.070
to identify the footprint.

05:55.099 --> 05:56.399
Secretary Kim?

05:56.669 --> 05:58.930
Hi, Mr. Won Joo Seok.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.739
Nice to meet you.

06:00.839 --> 06:02.339
I guess you know me.

06:02.539 --> 06:04.909
I know that you're Jinmi\NGroup Vice President...

06:04.909 --> 06:06.640
Song Tae Gyu's cousin.

06:07.539 --> 06:10.010
You're about to graduate\Nlaw school.

06:10.450 --> 06:13.219
You'll need to get\Nbetter grades.

06:13.380 --> 06:14.750
Exactly.

06:14.950 --> 06:17.489
I have no time for this.

06:17.890 --> 06:19.719
The corpse was found.

06:20.859 --> 06:23.589
Why did you\Njust leave it there?

06:27.130 --> 06:29.799
I wanted to look at it\Nfrom time to time.

06:31.570 --> 06:32.899
If you catch his weakness,

06:32.899 --> 06:35.039
you'll be able to use it\Nfor a long time.

06:35.169 --> 06:36.940
Why are you so worried?

06:37.770 --> 06:39.779
If you want to live\Na long, healthy life,

06:39.779 --> 06:41.710
you better think less.

06:43.180 --> 06:45.109
He's out of control.

06:45.109 --> 06:46.620
There are many ways...

06:46.620 --> 06:48.020
to control him.

06:53.359 --> 06:55.960
You made the matter\Nmore complicated.

06:56.330 --> 06:58.729
That's why I pestered\Nthe professor...

06:58.729 --> 07:00.560
and got a hold of you.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.000
Secretary Kim.

07:12.339 --> 07:13.539
Some serial killers...

07:13.539 --> 07:15.380
do not bury\Nthe corpses deep.

07:15.479 --> 07:18.109
They like to keep them\Nclose and observe them.

07:18.409 --> 07:21.020
They want to relive\Nthe moment...

07:21.120 --> 07:22.549
they committed murder.

07:22.779 --> 07:24.120
That means...

07:25.989 --> 07:27.260
it's a serial murder.

07:27.820 --> 07:29.690
When the fantasy\Nwears off,

07:29.690 --> 07:31.289
they commit murder again.

07:31.690 --> 07:33.599
That's why he went\Nback there a few times.

07:34.430 --> 07:36.430
If the corpse\Nhadn't been found,

07:36.430 --> 07:38.000
he would've\Nenjoyed it more.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.839
But the body was found.

07:39.870 --> 07:41.640
He'll kill again.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.239
It seems like\Nhe's just begun.

08:02.260 --> 08:03.930
She was\Na very pretty girl.

08:04.989 --> 08:06.500
I'll catch the culprit.

08:07.460 --> 08:08.630
You should take a rest.

08:08.799 --> 08:09.899
No.

08:10.330 --> 08:13.239
I want to see him\Ngetting arrested...

08:13.469 --> 08:14.969
with my own eyes.

08:16.039 --> 08:17.609
I'm worried about you.

08:17.609 --> 08:19.909
Don't worry about me\Ncrying.

08:20.210 --> 08:22.479
Mi Joo was tortured\Nand killed.

08:24.149 --> 08:25.409
I'm fine.

08:28.279 --> 08:30.390
She tried terribly hard\Nto fight him off.

08:30.950 --> 08:32.789
She had a lot of\Ncontusions.

08:42.460 --> 08:45.499
Mi Joo was studying\Nfor police exam.

08:46.239 --> 08:47.499
She must've left...

08:47.999 --> 08:49.940
some evidence\Non the culprit.

08:50.509 --> 08:52.869
A nail scratch\Nor tooth marks.

09:03.050 --> 09:04.450
What about\Nthe forensic results?

09:04.519 --> 09:05.790
Blood and flesh were\Nfound...

09:05.790 --> 09:07.589
in the fingernails.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.460
We'll have the DNA results\Nin a few days.

09:09.859 --> 09:11.859
She had a lot of scars\Non her body.

09:16.930 --> 09:19.670
She seemed to have been\Ndragged on a cement floor.

09:20.070 --> 09:22.170
She was found\Nin a reed field though.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.570
He probably abducted her\Nand moved her.

09:24.410 --> 09:25.839
There were tire tracks...

09:25.839 --> 09:27.839
at the scene.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.379
The pattern seemed\Npretty unique.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.920
He must've used the car\Nto move her.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.489
The place where the corpse\Nwas found...

09:39.050 --> 09:41.190
is difficult to get to\Non foot.

09:41.460 --> 09:44.989
Looking at\Nthe unique tire pattern,

09:44.989 --> 09:46.729
it must be foreign-made.

09:49.629 --> 09:50.969
What's the tire brand?

09:51.599 --> 09:52.800
It's premium.

09:53.599 --> 09:55.769
It'll be easy to find\Nthe manufacturer then.

09:55.769 --> 09:56.839
For sure.

09:57.810 --> 09:58.869
By the way,

10:00.180 --> 10:01.639
do you think...

10:02.180 --> 10:04.450
the culprit is\Na serial killer again?

10:04.780 --> 10:06.619
I never said that.

10:08.650 --> 10:13.089
Why did he leave\Nthe corpse here for days?

10:13.420 --> 10:15.460
He had enough time\Nto dispose it.

10:15.619 --> 10:17.460
He wanted to look at it\Nfor enjoyment.

10:18.089 --> 10:19.999
You seem very anxious.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.030
It must be\Na serial murder.

10:22.530 --> 10:24.900
You aren't usually\Ninterested in a case.

10:27.599 --> 10:28.769
You're a forensics agent.

10:28.769 --> 10:30.869
You shouldn't make\Na conclusion that easily.

10:32.570 --> 10:34.479
I want to tell you\Nsomething.

10:34.780 --> 10:36.349
Serial murders...

10:36.349 --> 10:38.009
aren't that common.

10:38.650 --> 10:41.920
Don't lean toward it\Ntoo much.

10:42.650 --> 10:44.050
I also hope it's not\Na serial murder.

12:42.639 --> 12:43.739
Did something happen...

12:46.609 --> 12:48.139
between you and Mi Joo?

12:48.940 --> 12:49.950
Of course not.

12:52.009 --> 12:53.219
You know...

12:54.519 --> 12:57.619
that Mi Joo\Nis too good for me.

12:59.889 --> 13:00.920
I was going to...

13:01.859 --> 13:03.589
let her go...

13:05.889 --> 13:07.530
when she said that\Nshe passed the exam.

13:09.599 --> 13:10.729
I wanted to make...

13:11.599 --> 13:13.599
good memories with her\Nfor the last time.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.070
I was going to tell her...

13:19.139 --> 13:22.509
that I was so thankful for\Nmeeting someone like me.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.519
She suffered so much and\Nfinally passed the exam.

13:28.420 --> 13:30.420
Why did her life\Nhave to be this miserable?

13:33.420 --> 13:34.719
I'm too resentful...

13:36.060 --> 13:37.629
to let her go like this.

13:41.259 --> 13:43.070
I'll catch the culprit\Nfor certain...

13:45.099 --> 13:46.940
and kill him myself.

13:52.469 --> 13:53.780
No, Si Hwan.

13:54.780 --> 13:55.910
You can't do that.

13:57.249 --> 13:58.249
Seol Ok.

13:59.479 --> 14:00.979
This is too hard for me\Nto stand.

14:17.570 --> 14:18.570
Si Hwan.

14:20.869 --> 14:22.800
Don't think about doing\Nsomething spontaneous.

14:23.269 --> 14:24.339
Okay?

14:26.170 --> 14:28.839
I'll make sure to catch\Nthe culprit.

14:29.780 --> 14:32.349
Let's catch him and make\Nhim get punished for it.

14:32.609 --> 14:35.379
I want to catch\Nthe culprit...

14:35.820 --> 14:36.820
myself too.

14:37.650 --> 14:39.960
Okay. Let's catch\Nthe culprit together.

14:40.690 --> 14:41.690
Try to find...

14:41.989 --> 14:43.960
Mi Joo's stuff like...

14:44.430 --> 14:47.129
her memos, pictures,\Nor diary first.

14:47.129 --> 14:49.359
Okay, I'll look for them.

14:58.910 --> 14:59.940
Right.

15:00.940 --> 15:03.780
Whining won't help us\Ncatch the culprit.

15:05.310 --> 15:06.349
Let's snap out of it.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.960
Why are you\Ncoming out of there?

15:23.369 --> 15:24.369
Go Si Hwan?

15:25.729 --> 15:26.739
Do you know me?

16:24.330 --> 16:25.629
Are you sure you\Ndon't have a boyfriend?

16:25.629 --> 16:26.999
I'm sure.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.369
I have some guys\Nwho ride my car though.

16:30.369 --> 16:32.400
They have a high\Nstandard in women.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.839
I got some flowers too.

16:34.839 --> 16:36.670
Really? What does he\Ndo for a living?

16:36.910 --> 16:38.369
How is\Nhis family background?

16:38.440 --> 16:40.009
I don't know who\Ngave me those flowers.

16:40.009 --> 16:42.040
It said Secretary Kim\Nin the letter.

16:45.910 --> 16:48.119
Dad. What's wrong?

16:50.119 --> 16:51.450
When did you get them?

16:52.190 --> 16:53.190
Yesterday.

16:54.859 --> 16:57.060
Why are you telling me\Nthis just now?

16:57.389 --> 16:58.830
Commute by my car\Nfrom today on.

16:59.089 --> 17:01.030
Why? It doesn't violate\Nthe vehicle regulation.

17:01.030 --> 17:02.460
Just do as I say.

17:03.229 --> 17:05.530
Ride my car when you\Ngo home from work too.

17:05.530 --> 17:07.269
Don't go to clubs\Nor anywhere else.

17:09.239 --> 17:10.239
Let's go.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.739
Dad.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.920
- Jang Goo.\N- What?

17:23.920 --> 17:25.749
Are you concerned\Nabout something?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.219
These days...

17:31.229 --> 17:33.660
No, it's just that\NI have a lot in mind.

17:35.759 --> 17:38.029
You shouldn't have\Ntoo much in mind...

17:38.130 --> 17:39.900
in order to live\Nhealthily and long.

17:40.469 --> 17:41.670
I know.

17:43.940 --> 17:48.210
How old is your daughter?

17:48.710 --> 17:50.610
She's 26 this year.

17:51.610 --> 17:53.519
She isn't married, is she?

17:53.519 --> 17:54.719
No.

17:55.079 --> 17:57.390
Set her up with someone\Nif there's anyone decent.

17:58.749 --> 18:01.690
Then you must live long...

18:01.719 --> 18:03.960
so that you can see\Nher get married.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.259
I should.

18:06.759 --> 18:09.529
For your daughter's sake,

18:09.529 --> 18:11.029
don't betray.

18:13.039 --> 18:14.039
What?

18:15.799 --> 18:17.009
Don't betray...

18:17.910 --> 18:19.809
Secretary Kim...

18:21.539 --> 18:24.680
if you want to keep\Nyour chief position.

18:26.420 --> 18:27.579
How...

18:29.890 --> 18:31.890
Oh, dear.

18:32.719 --> 18:33.719
I think...

18:34.590 --> 18:36.460
I won today.

18:37.759 --> 18:38.759
Well?

18:40.460 --> 18:41.999
Chief Shin Jang Goo.

18:45.930 --> 18:47.039
Secretary Kim?

18:58.309 --> 18:59.380
We're here, sir.

19:00.450 --> 19:02.479
- Have a seat.\N- Yes, sir.

19:05.450 --> 19:06.460
Mr. Gye.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.090
Be in charge of\NYoon Mi Joo's murder case.

19:11.190 --> 19:12.190
Pardon?

19:12.190 --> 19:14.259
Let Unit One be in charge\Nof the investigation.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.729
But now,

19:17.130 --> 19:19.969
Inspector Woo and Ha Wan\NSeung are in charge of...

19:21.739 --> 19:24.269
I'm not discussing\Nthings with you now.

19:29.509 --> 19:31.809
Why do you want\NUnit One to...

19:32.049 --> 19:33.120
Do you want to know?

19:34.019 --> 19:35.019
Really?

19:38.690 --> 19:40.960
Wouldn't it be\Ngood for you...

19:41.789 --> 19:43.489
to tell others that you\Njust signed the papers?

19:45.960 --> 19:46.960
Well,

19:47.460 --> 19:48.960
are you still curious?

19:51.130 --> 19:52.170
Do you want me\Nto tell you?

19:56.440 --> 19:58.239
Well... Sir.

19:59.539 --> 20:01.440
It's being investigated\Nby another team.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.779
We can't...

20:03.410 --> 20:05.049
Violent Crimes Unit Two\Nwon't let it slide.

20:05.049 --> 20:08.180
Especially Detective Ha.

20:08.579 --> 20:10.719
It's my order, so no one\Ncan say anything about it.

20:11.049 --> 20:15.059
Since when did we\Nneed his permission?

20:16.329 --> 20:17.630
That's not what I mean.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.029
Your unit is the ace\Nof our station.

20:24.870 --> 20:26.700
It's because Unit Two\Nis not trustworthy.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.340
Sir, even so...

20:29.670 --> 20:32.110
It won't look good\Nto take away their case.

20:32.210 --> 20:33.210
Manager Jo.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.779
That's not\Nwhat's important here.

20:34.779 --> 20:36.779
It's important\Nto solve the case.

20:36.779 --> 20:37.910
I can't believe this.

20:38.249 --> 20:39.450
You're right.

20:41.350 --> 20:43.090
Then how about...

20:43.450 --> 20:44.690
we tell the two teams...

20:45.090 --> 20:47.920
to investigate\Non the case together?

20:50.789 --> 20:52.059
That's not bad.

20:54.700 --> 20:55.759
Right?

20:59.370 --> 21:00.400
Okay, sir.

21:01.700 --> 21:02.700
Understood, sir.

21:04.870 --> 21:07.979
(Criminal Affairs\NDivision)

21:10.110 --> 21:11.110
How can I help you?

21:11.110 --> 21:12.680
I'm here to do\Na volunteer service...

21:12.680 --> 21:14.120
at Civil Affairs Center.

21:14.819 --> 21:15.950
It's that way.

21:17.420 --> 21:18.819
- Thank you.\N- No problem.

22:03.829 --> 22:05.229
Go search over there.

22:29.759 --> 22:32.229
Do you know the victim?

22:33.029 --> 22:34.529
I didn't know her\Npersonally.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.400
She was\Nmy friend's girlfriend.

22:38.799 --> 22:40.940
I hope Seol Ok catches\Nthe murderer quickly.

22:43.069 --> 22:44.069
Hey.

22:44.069 --> 22:45.539
Didn't the forensics\Ncome out last time?

22:45.539 --> 22:46.710
Why are they\Ndoing it again?

22:47.039 --> 22:49.180
They do it many times\Nfor big cases.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.380
I'm saying...

22:50.380 --> 22:51.880
it's game over\Nif Seol Ok investigated.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.549
They don't need\Nto do it again.

23:25.450 --> 23:27.279
I haven't seen this\Nbefore either.

23:28.680 --> 23:29.989
Something is weird.

23:32.090 --> 23:33.090
Professor Hwang.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.590
I found a strand of hair.

23:36.930 --> 23:38.229
What's going on?

23:38.430 --> 23:40.160
It wasn't here during\Nour first identification.

23:42.829 --> 23:43.829
Maybe the scene...

23:43.829 --> 23:45.400
might have\Nbeen contaminated.

24:53.799 --> 24:56.239
How are you guys\Npreserving the scene?

24:58.440 --> 25:00.710
You guys should always\Npreserve it thoroughly.

25:01.079 --> 25:03.279
You should say that to\NViolent Crimes Unit Two.

25:03.809 --> 25:06.150
I took this case\Nonly four hours ago.

25:06.180 --> 25:09.120
Why are there two teams\Nworking on the same case?

25:09.120 --> 25:10.920
It's hard to tell\Nwho's responsible.

25:11.450 --> 25:14.059
You'll need to talk\Nto Chief Shin about that.

25:14.660 --> 25:17.289
When the forensics result\Ncomes out, tell us first.

25:17.890 --> 25:19.390
Why should I?

25:21.259 --> 25:22.499
Please, I ask of you.

25:25.529 --> 25:26.539
Hey, Kyung Mi?

25:26.870 --> 25:28.440
Wrap up the scene well.

25:28.700 --> 25:29.870
Yes, Professor Hwang.

25:31.840 --> 25:32.910
Goodbye.

25:41.779 --> 25:43.019
Sergeant Yuk.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.049
Yes, sir.

25:46.259 --> 25:48.120
Hey. Take a picture\Nof this too.

25:49.059 --> 25:50.729
Did you find anything\Naround Yoon Mi Joo?

25:50.729 --> 25:52.160
Anyone suspicious?

25:52.160 --> 25:53.630
She hasn't met\Nher family and friends...

25:53.630 --> 25:54.829
for three years.

25:55.100 --> 25:57.529
She lived at Ino Residence\Nin Noryang-dong and...

25:57.799 --> 25:59.870
went to her classes and\Nthe study room. That's it.

26:04.039 --> 26:05.440
On the day\Nof Yoon Mi Joo's accident,

26:05.440 --> 26:07.809
she had one last phone\Ncall around 150m away...

26:07.809 --> 26:09.279
from Joongjin 6-dong\Nmobile base station.

26:09.910 --> 26:11.180
Two weeks later,

26:11.180 --> 26:13.150
she was found dead\Nin a reed field.

26:15.380 --> 26:17.920
Si Hwan, don't hang up.

26:18.590 --> 26:20.090
There's a weird guy\Nover there.

26:20.759 --> 26:22.120
He looks like a pervert.

26:23.390 --> 26:24.489
It looks like\Nshe was there...

26:24.489 --> 26:26.360
to see a friend who lives\Nin Joongjin 6-dong.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.870
It's a neighborhood where\Na pervert roams about.

26:30.870 --> 26:32.469
Are you saying\Nthat the pervert did it?

26:32.469 --> 26:34.170
It's nowhere near\Na women's school.

26:34.170 --> 26:36.269
That can't happen\Nout of nowhere.

26:36.710 --> 26:39.640
He's no longer\Njust a pervert.

26:40.710 --> 26:42.710
He's now evolved\Ninto a rapist.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.249
Right?

26:44.249 --> 26:45.350
Evolved?

26:46.150 --> 26:48.779
Are you talking about\Nlike how monkeys...

26:48.779 --> 26:51.190
turned into humans?

26:51.190 --> 26:52.249
Sergeant Yuk.

26:52.890 --> 26:54.759
Stop fooling around\Nand listen up.

26:56.019 --> 26:58.029
She was killed\Nin Joongjin 6-dong,

26:58.360 --> 27:00.900
then moved to\Nthe reed field by a car.

27:01.059 --> 27:03.069
A lot of abrasions caused\Nby a cement floor...

27:03.069 --> 27:05.529
were found on her body.

27:05.529 --> 27:08.440
However, the reed field\Nhas wet, muddy floor.

27:08.799 --> 27:10.370
You can get scraped\Nby mud.

27:10.370 --> 27:12.410
I've done that often when\NI got drunk, so I know.

27:12.410 --> 27:15.479
It's completely different\Nfrom the ones that are...

27:15.479 --> 27:16.809
caused by\Nhard concrete floors.

27:33.900 --> 27:35.630
She was scraped\Non a cement floor.

27:37.930 --> 27:40.840
We found a lot of\Ntraces on the soil.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.539
However, I'm not sure\Nif it belongs...

27:43.539 --> 27:44.940
to the victim,\NYoon Mi Joo.

27:56.319 --> 27:58.690
It doesn't matter\Nif it's mud or cement.

27:58.890 --> 28:00.620
Those scrapes aren't\Nthe cause of her death.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.660
Death by suffocation\Nfrom cervical pressure.

28:04.329 --> 28:05.890
Don't you know what it is?

28:05.890 --> 28:07.430
It means\Nshe was strangled.

28:08.029 --> 28:10.069
Then let's stop talking\Nabout the cement floor.

28:10.870 --> 28:12.400
We found tire tracks\Non the scene...

28:12.400 --> 28:13.999
where her body\Nwas abandoned.

28:17.910 --> 28:19.739
They were expensive tires\Nfor special purposes.

28:19.809 --> 28:21.340
They're not something\Nyou see every day.

28:21.340 --> 28:23.180
There's a high possibility\Nthe woman...

28:23.350 --> 28:25.110
was unconscious when she\Nwas moved by the car...

28:25.110 --> 28:27.049
and murdered later on.

28:28.350 --> 28:30.850
Do you have evidence those\Ntracks are the murderer's?

28:31.590 --> 28:34.519
A lot of anglers go and\Npark there at night.

28:34.759 --> 28:37.989
Did he leave\Nhis name on the tires?

29:18.469 --> 29:19.940
Seol Ok.

29:19.940 --> 29:21.840
I heard from\Nthe forensics team...

29:21.940 --> 29:24.440
that they found a strand\Nof hair, footprints,

29:24.440 --> 29:26.340
and bloodstained reeds.

29:30.079 --> 29:31.079
Thanks.

29:31.079 --> 29:32.380
- Do you want this?\N- Yes.

29:43.289 --> 29:44.860
She was taken out\Nright here.

29:46.360 --> 29:51.329
(52N 2693)

30:20.700 --> 30:21.930
It looks like...

30:22.259 --> 30:23.930
she was dragged over...

30:24.670 --> 30:26.539
unconsciously at first.

30:47.590 --> 30:50.190
Then she woke up\Nsoon after.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.700
And she struggled...

30:54.160 --> 30:55.200
to live.

31:23.529 --> 31:25.090
This must be the place,\NMi Joo.

31:27.029 --> 31:28.229
This was your last.

31:43.979 --> 31:45.049
Mi Joo...

31:45.880 --> 31:47.549
was abducted\Nfrom another place...

31:48.279 --> 31:49.749
unconsciously.

31:50.090 --> 31:51.890
She was first assaulted\Non a hard ground...

31:51.890 --> 31:53.719
like a cement floor.

31:54.259 --> 31:55.920
She has a lot\Nof abrasions on her body.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.130
Then...

31:57.130 --> 31:58.430
it must be Joongjin-dong.

31:58.890 --> 32:00.400
She had an appointment\Nin Joongjin-dong...

32:00.529 --> 32:02.400
on the day\Nshe went missing.

32:03.170 --> 32:05.900
When did you\Nlast hear from her?

32:05.999 --> 32:07.069
Two weeks ago.

32:07.870 --> 32:09.940
She's sometimes late,

32:10.170 --> 32:12.309
but she's not a type\Nthat wouldn't show up.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.579
I couldn't reach her\Never since that day.

32:16.380 --> 32:18.380
She couldn't be reached\Nafter that day.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.170
She could have been\Nalready dead.

32:39.130 --> 32:42.539
Pretty much everywhere\Nin Seoul is cement floor.

32:44.670 --> 32:46.410
Let's go\Nto Joongjin-dong first.

32:53.519 --> 32:54.549
Corporal Gong.

32:55.150 --> 32:56.620
Did you analyze\Nthe surveillance videos?

32:56.890 --> 32:57.890
Yes.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.390
There are no cameras\Nnear the scene, but...

33:00.390 --> 33:03.360
a blue car was caught\Non video in the vicinity.

33:03.630 --> 33:05.130
It's the same model\Nas the car...

33:05.130 --> 33:06.630
that was seen\Nnear the scene.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.600
Search the roads leading\Ninto Joongjin-dong first.

33:10.700 --> 33:13.269
The victim seems abducted\Nin Joongjin 6-dong.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.249
Mi Joo was going\Nto meet her friend...

33:25.509 --> 33:27.219
somewhere near here.

33:27.749 --> 33:30.090
This place seems dangerous\Nwith a lot of alleys.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.019
Hey, Corporal Gong.

33:34.289 --> 33:35.819
I have the plate number.

33:36.059 --> 33:37.360
Really? You got it?

33:48.340 --> 33:49.870
You must be well-versed\Nin law.

33:50.410 --> 33:51.809
- Corporal Gong.\N- Yes?

33:51.870 --> 33:52.979
Explain in detail to him.

33:52.979 --> 33:54.979
Hey. Under Article 9\Nof Sexual Assault Law,

33:54.979 --> 33:56.680
you're under arrest\Nfor rape and murder.

33:56.680 --> 33:57.680
Give me your backpack.

33:59.749 --> 34:00.950
You...

34:00.950 --> 34:03.190
have the right\Nto an attorney.

34:03.289 --> 34:05.190
You don't have to speak.\NAnything you say now...

34:05.620 --> 34:08.190
might be used against you\Nin the court.

34:08.190 --> 34:09.190
Let's go.

34:21.599 --> 34:23.869
(Scientific Investigation)

34:29.309 --> 34:31.349
The owner of this car\Nis the culprit.

34:31.610 --> 34:32.610
Pardon?

34:32.780 --> 34:35.179
Did you find the victim's\Nblood or fingerprints?

34:35.219 --> 34:36.219
No.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.518
It's too clean.

34:37.518 --> 34:38.889
If it's this clean...

34:38.889 --> 34:41.460
Oh, that means he cleaned\Nthe fingerprints.

34:41.489 --> 34:44.329
I can't even find a minute\Npiece of evidence.

34:44.929 --> 34:46.728
This is done\Nby a professional.

34:58.110 --> 34:59.309
Is your team doing well?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.010
What do you mean?

35:01.010 --> 35:02.579
I think you guys\Ngot the wrong guy.

35:02.740 --> 35:04.249
We'll find out whether\Nwe are wrong or not...

35:04.679 --> 35:05.909
once we investigate him.

35:12.220 --> 35:14.059
Oh, you're in law school.

35:14.159 --> 35:16.329
And you volunteer at\NJoongjin Police Station.

35:16.490 --> 35:17.490
Yes.

35:17.530 --> 35:18.929
I do legal counselling...

35:18.929 --> 35:20.300
as volunteer work.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.360
But...

35:21.559 --> 35:23.829
you started volunteering\Nat our station...

35:23.999 --> 35:26.269
after Yoon Mi Joo's\Nbody was found.

35:26.269 --> 35:27.269
Is that so?

35:27.639 --> 35:28.970
That's interesting.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.979
A culprit...

35:32.979 --> 35:34.579
would be curious about...

35:34.579 --> 35:35.610
how the investigation\Nis going.

35:36.880 --> 35:39.050
What are you saying?

35:39.309 --> 35:40.650
I'm just saying...

35:40.920 --> 35:42.679
a culprit\Nwould be like that.

35:42.679 --> 35:43.690
I see.

35:44.420 --> 35:46.460
Then that has nothing\Nto do with me.

35:50.630 --> 35:53.229
Don't men usually\Nfind a woman...

35:53.599 --> 35:56.729
unattractive\Nif she says no to them...

35:57.130 --> 35:58.369
or resists them...

35:59.099 --> 36:01.269
when they make a move?

36:01.840 --> 36:04.210
It's more interesting\Nwhen she resists.

36:04.940 --> 36:07.610
It's no fun if she's\Nsubmissive all the time.

36:07.740 --> 36:10.449
Why did he even kill her\Nif she was interesting?

36:10.710 --> 36:13.619
Because killing\Nis more fun, maybe?

36:13.619 --> 36:14.720
Is that why\Nyou killed her?

36:15.579 --> 36:16.690
Well, I mean...

36:16.690 --> 36:18.920
the culprit would've.

36:22.519 --> 36:24.190
Didn't you say\Nyou major in law?

36:25.990 --> 36:27.460
You know\Nwhat's going on...

36:28.229 --> 36:30.269
in the culprit's mind\Nvery well.

36:31.030 --> 36:32.099
No, I don't.

36:32.699 --> 36:34.170
It's just a guess.

36:45.179 --> 36:46.349
Secondary identification\Nresult...

36:46.349 --> 36:47.550
shows the same DNA...

36:47.550 --> 36:49.990
from the hair and blood.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.119
What about the footprint?

36:51.420 --> 36:54.090
The shoe is registered\Nin the footprint database.

36:54.090 --> 36:56.559
It's a shoe that can be\Nbought in a market easily.

36:57.190 --> 36:59.929
It's very worn. He's been\Nwearing it for too long.

37:05.570 --> 37:08.139
(Two days ago)

37:10.670 --> 37:12.639
(Joogjin Police)

37:16.749 --> 37:18.150
How can I help you?

37:18.349 --> 37:21.619
I'm here to see Unit\NOne's Mr. Gye Sung Woo.

37:22.920 --> 37:23.920
That's me.

37:24.519 --> 37:26.760
I might be able to help\Nwith an investigation.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.019
How?

37:28.019 --> 37:31.159
I know something\Nabout the female corpse...

37:31.429 --> 37:33.699
that was found\Nin the reed field.

37:39.229 --> 37:40.240
You were at the site...

37:40.240 --> 37:41.840
where Yoon Mi Joo's corpse\Nwas found?

37:42.269 --> 37:43.269
Yes.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.470
I was passing by the area\Nin my car.

37:46.070 --> 37:48.809
I saw a man hitting\Na woman from afar.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.449
- Hey.\N- Let me go.

37:55.519 --> 37:56.590
Where are you going?

37:58.720 --> 38:01.019
How can you say that you\Nwon't meet me anymore?

38:04.090 --> 38:05.960
As a law student,

38:05.960 --> 38:07.729
I couldn't turn my back.

38:09.829 --> 38:10.829
Stop it.

38:10.829 --> 38:13.300
- Come!\N- Let this go!

38:15.599 --> 38:17.670
Stop bothering me!

38:22.010 --> 38:24.449
How can you do this to me?

38:27.780 --> 38:28.820
Are you okay?

38:29.119 --> 38:31.249
- I'm fine.\N- Why don't I...

38:31.249 --> 38:33.289
Mind your own business!

38:33.760 --> 38:34.760
Gosh.

38:39.559 --> 38:41.030
She told me\Nto mind my own business.

38:41.030 --> 38:43.300
So I couldn't stay there\Nany longer.

38:43.999 --> 38:46.400
Also, she kept hitting\Nand scratching me.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.139
So it was awkward\Nto stay there.

38:48.940 --> 38:49.940
Yes.

39:01.349 --> 39:03.289
Si Hwan is the culprit?

39:03.889 --> 39:05.749
A strand of hair and\Nfootprint were found.

39:06.090 --> 39:08.119
They weren't found\Nat the scene.

39:08.119 --> 39:09.490
They came out in the\Nsecondary identification.

39:09.829 --> 39:10.960
Do you also think...

39:11.429 --> 39:13.429
Si Hwan is the culprit?

39:16.900 --> 39:18.630
But we found the evidence.

39:19.269 --> 39:20.470
We can't ignore that.

39:20.999 --> 39:22.070
This is frustrating.

39:36.949 --> 39:38.190
He took off.

39:39.190 --> 39:40.260
Gather evidence.

39:46.460 --> 39:47.460
Wait.

39:49.199 --> 39:51.429
Why are the pieces of\Nevidence so neatly placed?

39:52.970 --> 39:54.970
It looks like\Nhe laid them out for us.

39:56.409 --> 39:58.210
They usually...

39:58.210 --> 40:00.079
take the laptop even\Nwhen they run away...

40:01.079 --> 40:02.079
in a hurry.

40:07.479 --> 40:09.349
Secretary Kim\Nis on the move.

40:09.690 --> 40:11.949
He's fabricating\Na murder case.

40:13.190 --> 40:14.490
We have to act fast.

40:16.119 --> 40:17.130
Then...

40:18.929 --> 40:20.429
are we a team?

40:20.729 --> 40:23.729
I'm not used\Nto working with someone.

40:23.970 --> 40:25.269
Under one condition,\Nthough.

40:27.170 --> 40:28.900
Don't drag\NWan Seung into this.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.869
Secretary Kim\Nis dangerous.

40:32.769 --> 40:33.840
Also,

40:34.639 --> 40:36.710
don't tell him\NSeo Hyun Soo is alive...

40:37.809 --> 40:39.449
or that I'm...

40:41.079 --> 40:42.220
Seo Hyun Soo.

40:42.889 --> 40:43.889
Why?

40:45.150 --> 40:47.860
Isn't it better for him\Nto think that I'm dead?

40:49.059 --> 40:50.059
Because now...

40:51.260 --> 40:52.829
I've become a monster.

40:55.229 --> 40:57.530
Then why did you\Nlinger around?

40:59.639 --> 41:01.740
Because I couldn't\Nnot do that.

41:04.110 --> 41:05.869
If I could...

41:07.309 --> 41:08.780
I had no choice.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.510
I couldn't not do that.

41:15.679 --> 41:18.550
Lady, tell me\Nhow I could not do that.

41:21.619 --> 41:24.559
I kept asking for\Njust one more day,

41:26.329 --> 41:27.960
and I ended up like this.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.599
I shouldn't have opened\Nthe fourth Genoise shop.

41:33.670 --> 41:35.369
Then there wouldn't\Nhave been a fire,

41:36.840 --> 41:39.740
and Wan Seung\Nwouldn't have met me.

41:41.210 --> 41:43.409
Hey.\NYou can't go in there.

41:43.679 --> 41:44.679
Well...

41:45.909 --> 41:47.019
That's me.

41:47.619 --> 41:48.849
I'm the owner.

41:49.550 --> 41:50.550
Okay.

41:50.550 --> 41:54.619
I got greedy then.

41:56.630 --> 41:57.729
I was foolish.

41:59.530 --> 42:01.030
Please put this ring\Ninside this.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.699
Okay. I'll bring it over.

42:06.699 --> 42:07.740
Thanks.

42:20.249 --> 42:21.749
I won't make mistakes\Nanymore.

42:22.179 --> 42:24.090
Please stop looking\Nfor Seo Hyun Soo.

42:26.090 --> 42:27.119
I...

42:28.559 --> 42:30.690
will live forever\Nas Jung Hee Yeon.

42:32.929 --> 42:33.960
Fine.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.030
Then tell me now.

42:36.369 --> 42:38.170
Who is Secretary Kim?

42:38.170 --> 42:39.570
And where is he?

42:41.199 --> 42:42.869
Somewhere very close.

42:53.179 --> 42:54.249
Ji Seung.

42:55.420 --> 42:56.590
Hey. Wan Seung.

42:56.590 --> 42:57.789
What brings you here?

42:58.119 --> 42:59.820
Oh, are you here for\Nthe Civil Affairs Center?

43:00.059 --> 43:01.090
No.

43:01.090 --> 43:02.090
Then...

43:02.260 --> 43:03.389
are you here to see me?

43:05.389 --> 43:07.130
I'm here as the attorney\Nof Won Joo Seok.

43:09.130 --> 43:10.130
What?

43:15.670 --> 43:16.710
Ji Seung.

43:17.710 --> 43:19.440
That punk is a lunatic.

43:20.940 --> 43:23.179
I'm here as the attorney\Nof Won Joo Seok.

43:23.179 --> 43:24.610
So watch your language.

43:24.610 --> 43:26.820
You will\Nbe my attorney, right?

43:28.320 --> 43:31.420
It's awkward to tell the\Ntruth to another attorney.

43:32.050 --> 43:34.090
He'll commit another\Nmurder again later.

43:34.090 --> 43:36.260
He's never\Nmurdered anyone.

43:36.260 --> 43:37.590
He won't\Nin the future as well.

43:37.590 --> 43:39.329
I killed someone\Nby accident.

43:40.030 --> 43:41.729
- What?\N- Yes.

43:42.260 --> 43:43.970
Is his dad the president\Nof this country or what?

43:44.670 --> 43:45.970
Why is the president\Nof Ha and Jung Law Firm...

43:45.970 --> 43:47.099
defending him?

43:47.099 --> 43:50.170
I've never imagined\Nthat you could've done...

43:50.170 --> 43:51.909
such a thing\Nin the past...

43:53.710 --> 43:56.079
because you always\Nlooked so nice like this.

43:56.510 --> 43:58.349
Let's stick to the point.

43:58.349 --> 44:00.320
The tire tracks from the\Nsite match with his car's.

44:00.320 --> 44:01.780
It's the evidence\Nthat he went there.

44:01.780 --> 44:03.490
It's not the evidence\Nof murder.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.699
What about the DNA found\Nin her fingernails?

44:18.699 --> 44:20.940
I heard that he tried\Nto stop the fight.

44:28.240 --> 44:29.849
You know...

44:30.979 --> 44:32.150
that he's the culprit,\Nright?

44:34.380 --> 44:36.249
I'll take Won Joo Seok\Nout with me.

44:36.550 --> 44:37.920
Why are you doing this?

44:39.990 --> 44:41.720
I'm doing my best...

44:41.720 --> 44:43.490
for Ha and Jung Law Firm\Nand my family.

44:45.490 --> 44:47.530
You're becoming more\Nand more like our father.

44:49.099 --> 44:50.829
I'm here as his attorney.

44:51.070 --> 44:52.599
You can't confine him any\Nlonger without a warrant.

44:52.599 --> 44:54.039
So I'll take him\Nout with me.

44:55.369 --> 44:56.369
Oh, and...

44:56.769 --> 44:57.869
it's said\Nthat the culprit...

44:59.440 --> 45:01.940
is the victim's\Nex-boyfriend.

45:19.860 --> 45:21.130
Let's go have some food.

45:34.340 --> 45:35.639
It's him for certain.

45:38.179 --> 45:39.249
Who is he?

45:39.820 --> 45:40.820
Is he...

45:41.349 --> 45:42.679
the suspect\Nfor Mi Joo's case?

45:43.619 --> 45:45.019
He's the culprit\Nfor certain.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.990
And you're releasing him\Nlike that?

45:50.030 --> 45:52.729
Are you just going to\Nmake him walk away?

45:53.559 --> 45:54.729
Not a chance.

45:55.429 --> 45:56.729
He'll come back here soon\Nfor sure.

46:00.900 --> 46:02.470
- Detective Ha.\N- Yes?

46:02.940 --> 46:05.039
What brings you here?

46:05.039 --> 46:07.880
You asked for the list of\Nvolunteers the other day.

46:07.940 --> 46:09.210
The alleyway\Na while ago...

46:09.210 --> 46:11.050
Oh, the pervert\Nin a trench coat?

46:11.050 --> 46:12.050
Yes.

46:14.979 --> 46:17.990
That case hasn't been\Nsolved yet either.

46:22.559 --> 46:25.159
It's the volunteers' list\Nwhich you asked for.

46:25.329 --> 46:26.329
This is\Nthe address list...

46:26.329 --> 46:27.729
of those who are\Nreceiving help.

46:33.570 --> 46:34.800
(Volunteering Area)

46:34.840 --> 46:36.409
There are about\N15 people...

46:36.470 --> 46:38.309
in Joongjin 6-dong.

46:38.639 --> 46:41.039
The volunteer who lives\Nat the dead-end alley...

46:41.240 --> 46:43.579
where Shim Ji Eun and Kim\NHan Na disappeared is...

46:45.749 --> 46:48.320
"Law School\Nof S University".

46:48.780 --> 46:49.949
There's Won Joo Seok.

46:51.019 --> 46:52.019
What?

46:52.420 --> 46:53.490
Won Joo Seok?

47:00.499 --> 47:01.860
We might be able\Nto catch him.

47:02.030 --> 47:03.030
All right.

47:06.539 --> 47:08.139
Everyone's here, so\Nlet's begin the meeting.

47:10.340 --> 47:11.570
Number one is Lee So Yeon.

47:14.010 --> 47:15.579
Number two is Kim Han Na.

47:16.650 --> 47:19.309
Number four\Nis Shim Ji Eun.

47:21.949 --> 47:23.889
Number three\Nis Yoon Mi Joo.

47:30.659 --> 47:31.990
This is the order.

47:33.329 --> 47:36.030
Between Kim Han Na\Nand Shim Ji Eun,

47:36.869 --> 47:38.199
Yoon Mi Joo died.

47:38.829 --> 47:41.099
Nail marks were\Nfound on her neck.

47:43.940 --> 47:45.670
It means that\Nhe didn't wear gloves.

47:47.010 --> 47:48.139
The gloves appeared...

47:48.479 --> 47:50.079
from Shim Ji Eun's case.

47:50.909 --> 47:53.349
He suddenly started\Nto wear a mask and gloves.

47:53.349 --> 47:54.479
Why?

47:54.949 --> 47:56.590
Because he killed\NYoon Mi Joo.

47:56.690 --> 47:57.789
He changed...

47:58.650 --> 48:00.619
because he evolved\Ninto a murderer.

48:01.619 --> 48:03.229
Yoon Mi Joo\Nwas his first murder.

48:03.889 --> 48:05.190
It was\Nan accidental murder.

48:05.190 --> 48:07.260
His killing instinct\Nwas awakened by accident.

48:07.630 --> 48:09.030
It's awake.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.329
It won't go back to sleep\Nuntil the day he dies.

48:11.829 --> 48:13.699
Isn't it too soon\Nto jump into a conclusion?

48:13.800 --> 48:15.639
You must know because you\Ninvestigated on drugs...

48:16.099 --> 48:18.409
that they can never\Nquit it by themselves.

48:19.170 --> 48:20.340
It's an addiction.

48:20.409 --> 48:21.639
He's addicted to murder.

48:22.909 --> 48:25.550
Will he become\Na serial killer then?

48:26.150 --> 48:27.650
We must catch him\Nquickly then.

48:28.449 --> 48:30.420
He'll begin\Nhis serial killing soon...

48:32.789 --> 48:34.990
because he's lost\Nthe body.

48:36.530 --> 48:38.190
The body\Nis like a report...

48:38.190 --> 48:39.490
which he feels\Nproud and precious of.

48:40.329 --> 48:42.130
He's lost\Nhis report card...

48:42.130 --> 48:43.999
which can prove\Nhis strength.

48:44.130 --> 48:45.829
His anxiety...

48:46.470 --> 48:48.199
must be at the top level\Nby now.

48:49.909 --> 48:51.340
He must be\Nin a dangerous state.

48:52.110 --> 48:53.179
Soon,

48:53.610 --> 48:55.309
he'll begin his hunting.

48:55.809 --> 48:57.909
He gets anxious\Nif he can't kill a person?

48:58.309 --> 48:59.849
He's a real lunatic.

49:03.449 --> 49:04.449
Well...

49:05.550 --> 49:07.889
There's another person who\Nwitnessed the pervert...

49:07.889 --> 49:09.119
at the alley\Nin Joongjin 6-dong.

49:09.159 --> 49:11.590
I want to ask if you\Nneed her testimony...

49:11.590 --> 49:13.030
and go now.

49:13.030 --> 49:14.099
Another witness?

49:14.729 --> 49:15.729
Yes.

49:19.769 --> 49:22.199
(Snow Removal Equipment)

49:27.409 --> 49:28.880
Do you remember\Nhis face by any chance?

49:29.710 --> 49:31.679
No, he was covering\Nhis face.

49:31.909 --> 49:33.820
Was he wearing gloves too?

49:36.019 --> 49:37.289
Do you think it's\NWon Joo Seok?

49:39.289 --> 49:40.860
Can you tell us...

49:41.920 --> 49:43.559
what happened here?

50:04.579 --> 50:05.849
Darn it.

50:12.249 --> 50:13.519
What's going on?

50:25.829 --> 50:27.499
It's a bloodstained\Nfingerprint.

50:27.499 --> 50:28.840
If we compare\Nfingerprints,

50:28.840 --> 50:29.970
the result will\Ncome out quicker...

50:29.970 --> 50:31.240
than that of\NNational Forensic Service.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.780
We can't prove his crime\Nonly with this.

50:35.539 --> 50:36.710
If it goes well...

50:38.280 --> 50:39.380
Are you getting\Nthe feeling again?

50:48.760 --> 50:50.559
The tire tracks\Nof Won Joo Seok's car...

50:50.559 --> 50:52.190
and his footprints\Nwere found.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.199
His flesh and bloodstain\Nwere found...

51:02.199 --> 51:04.840
underneath Mi Joo's\Nnails too.

51:04.840 --> 51:06.240
But when his hair\Nand footprints...

51:06.240 --> 51:07.510
were found\Nin the residence...

51:07.510 --> 51:09.309
He became the witness\Nright away.

51:09.539 --> 51:10.579
You were at the site...

51:10.579 --> 51:11.880
where Yoon Mi Joo's corpse\Nwas found?

51:12.479 --> 51:13.519
Yes.

51:13.780 --> 51:15.650
I was passing by the area\Nin my car.

51:16.389 --> 51:18.889
I saw a man hitting\Na woman from afar.

51:19.119 --> 51:20.860
He testified that Si Hwan\Nand Mi Joo...

51:20.860 --> 51:23.190
were fighting\Nin the reed field.

51:31.999 --> 51:34.539
But if Mi Joo's\Nbloodstain is found...

51:35.170 --> 51:36.940
in this alleyway...

51:36.940 --> 51:38.409
He'll have to explain...

51:38.809 --> 51:40.510
why she was here...

51:40.880 --> 51:42.179
and why he bled.

51:42.909 --> 51:45.409
What if her blood is\Nfound in Joongjin-dong...

51:45.809 --> 51:47.550
when she lived\Nin Noryang-dong?

51:48.550 --> 51:49.990
It's enough of evidence...

51:49.990 --> 51:51.519
that he moved her\Nin his vehicle.

51:51.820 --> 51:54.690
But it'll take\Nforever to search...

51:54.690 --> 51:56.159
all these alleyways.

51:56.460 --> 51:58.889
It's too wide of a range\Nto identify.

52:01.429 --> 52:03.999
I marked some of\NWon Joo Seok's routes...

52:03.999 --> 52:06.400
around the houses where he\Ndid a volunteer service...

52:06.539 --> 52:09.300
based on the victims'\Ntestimonies.

52:09.499 --> 52:10.639
(Joongjin 6-dong)

52:12.110 --> 52:13.139
So?

52:13.309 --> 52:14.409
Kyung Mi.

52:15.079 --> 52:16.139
Please do us a favor.

52:16.979 --> 52:18.579
Please find\NMi Joo's traces.

52:20.679 --> 52:23.650
Hey, I'm only a trainee.

52:24.650 --> 52:26.460
How can I look around\Nthe entire neighborhood...

52:26.460 --> 52:27.860
to find her bloodstain?

52:27.860 --> 52:28.860
Kyung Mi.

52:30.190 --> 52:31.260
- You can do it!\N- You can do it!

52:31.260 --> 52:32.260
Bye.

52:32.590 --> 52:33.599
Go!

52:34.460 --> 52:35.460
Hey!

52:36.869 --> 52:37.869
Hey!

52:52.749 --> 52:54.179
(Forensic Team)

53:10.570 --> 53:11.570
My back hurts.

53:12.630 --> 53:14.840
I'm too old\Nto be doing this.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.579
I'm almost done\Nwith this side.

53:25.849 --> 53:26.920
Could it be over there?

53:31.789 --> 53:33.420
You haven't found\NGo Si Hwan yet?

53:33.420 --> 53:35.619
We looked all over\NNoryang-dong, but no.

53:35.990 --> 53:37.729
Darn it, where is he?

53:37.860 --> 53:40.300
His phone is turned off,\Nso we can't check that.

53:40.630 --> 53:41.699
Put him on a wanted list.

53:41.829 --> 53:42.929
Yes, sir.

53:55.280 --> 53:57.650
Grandpa, wasn't it hard\Nto get by when I was gone?

54:04.619 --> 54:06.119
I'll visit more often.

54:06.490 --> 54:07.490
Okay.

54:41.990 --> 54:43.260
My goodness.

54:45.630 --> 54:46.699
Are you a pervert?

54:53.639 --> 54:55.900
Hey, come on, pervert.

54:57.869 --> 54:58.869
That jerk.

55:09.150 --> 55:10.150
Hey!

55:51.760 --> 55:53.030
Mr. Won Joo Seok.

55:55.159 --> 55:56.369
Who are you?

55:56.369 --> 55:57.869
I knew it was this house.

55:59.530 --> 56:01.470
You've been\Nvolunteering diligently,

56:02.039 --> 56:03.110
especially in this house.

56:03.170 --> 56:04.539
And the old man...

56:04.740 --> 56:06.479
won't wake up\Nwith this much fuss.

56:06.479 --> 56:07.780
Much better for him.

56:08.039 --> 56:09.909
It's a perfect place\Nto hide the evidence.

56:18.820 --> 56:19.860
That idiot.

56:20.460 --> 56:21.960
- Corporal Gong!\N- Yes, sir!

56:27.260 --> 56:29.530
This is\Nmy favorite moment.

56:29.530 --> 56:31.229
Hey, this gets addictive.

56:31.229 --> 56:33.199
You'll never be able to\Nleave Violent Crimes Unit.

56:33.199 --> 56:34.699
And only your credit card\Nbill will increase.

56:35.039 --> 56:36.539
I'll use\Nmy dad's credit card.

56:37.039 --> 56:39.039
I wish I had your life.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.280
Get up, you idiot.

56:41.780 --> 56:45.610
I'm just an eyewitness\Nwho saw them in a fight.

56:45.610 --> 56:47.650
You're a criminal\Ncaught in act right now.

56:48.880 --> 56:50.650
What will you say\Nabout the evidence?

56:51.090 --> 56:54.289
We can trace all\Nof the victims with these.

56:55.690 --> 56:56.690
Gosh, my back hurts.

57:03.229 --> 57:04.229
Did you find it?

57:04.499 --> 57:05.599
Of course I did.

57:08.139 --> 57:09.199
I knew it.

57:09.369 --> 57:11.010
We have to go through\Na DNA analysis.

57:11.010 --> 57:13.940
We don't know if it's\NMi Joo's blood yet.

57:14.340 --> 57:17.110
It might Go Yoo Ri's,\Nthe fourth victim.

57:18.510 --> 57:21.449
You sound like someone\Nfrom forensics now.

57:21.749 --> 57:22.749
Really?

57:25.519 --> 57:26.590
Is this him?

57:26.860 --> 57:28.090
Let's stop chatting...

57:28.090 --> 57:30.090
and get going. We have to\Nquestion other victims.

57:31.490 --> 57:32.490
Come.

57:42.240 --> 57:43.240
Yes.

57:47.110 --> 57:48.940
Why did you bring back\Nthe eyewitness?

57:49.510 --> 57:51.280
I thought\NI explained it to you.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.409
He was caught in act.

57:52.710 --> 57:54.380
He got caught trying to\Nabduct Constable Shin.

57:54.679 --> 57:55.679
What?

57:57.050 --> 57:59.889
My lipstick is\Nall over these gloves.

58:09.769 --> 58:11.070
What happened\Nto Go Si Hwan?

58:12.429 --> 58:14.039
Don't think about\Ncatching him only.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.800
Try to broaden out\Nyour dragnet.

58:26.619 --> 58:28.179
Why am I in here again?

58:29.220 --> 58:30.849
That's what\NI want to ask you.

58:31.190 --> 58:32.449
Why did you go there?

58:32.449 --> 58:34.289
Don't try to fool me.

58:34.519 --> 58:36.490
I heard Secretary Kim\Nnever makes a mistake.

58:36.490 --> 58:37.659
Did you set me up\Nwith a fake one?

58:37.659 --> 58:38.659
I'm asking you.

58:38.659 --> 58:41.159
What have you been\Ndoing in that alley?

58:43.599 --> 58:45.929
I just took walks\Nto blow off stress.

58:47.999 --> 58:50.139
When will you\Nget me out of here?

58:51.210 --> 58:52.210
Do you...

58:53.280 --> 58:54.780
not realize\Nwhat you have done?

58:55.340 --> 58:58.010
This isn't something\Nyou can easily cover up.

59:01.579 --> 59:03.519
Then what about\Nwhat you've done?

59:05.320 --> 59:06.760
You covered that up\Nvery easily.

59:20.240 --> 59:21.369
We need to talk.

59:21.800 --> 59:23.510
I'm sorry. I'm busy.

59:23.510 --> 59:25.970
Defending him won't help\NHa and Jung in any way.

59:28.610 --> 59:31.010
I never knew you were\Nworried about Ha and Jung.

59:34.179 --> 59:35.650
Does he have\Nsomething on you?

59:37.420 --> 59:40.289
Is that the reason\Nlawyers defend people?

59:40.289 --> 59:42.690
I really don't get\Nyour decision.

59:42.690 --> 59:44.630
Won Joo Seok is\Na rapist and a murderer.

59:44.630 --> 59:46.229
Even the most\Natrocious criminals...

59:46.229 --> 59:47.229
need a lawyer.

59:47.229 --> 59:48.530
Then you know...

59:48.999 --> 59:50.199
that he's\Nan atrocious criminal.

59:50.199 --> 59:52.199
That's a way\Nthat a policeman talks.

59:52.199 --> 59:54.800
What's important is if\Nhe broke the law or not.

59:54.800 --> 59:56.539
So it's fine as long as\Nthere's no evidence?

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.940
What are you\Ntrying to say to me?

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:04.380
Is someone behind this?

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.749
- What?\N- Someone is...

01:00:11.019 --> 01:00:12.519
fabricating the evidence.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:22.929
What did you do to\Ncover up Joo Seok's crime?

01:00:23.229 --> 01:00:24.999
Well, this and that.

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.440
Will you blame someone\Nelse for this, or...

01:00:30.409 --> 01:00:32.309
I wouldn't do that.

01:00:33.579 --> 01:00:35.809
I'm just covering up\Nthis incident.

01:00:36.979 --> 01:00:40.019
I can't go that far\Nand blame someone else.

01:00:58.369 --> 01:01:00.670
Then what will\Nhappen to him in the end?

01:01:01.639 --> 01:01:02.970
It'll become\Nan unresolved case.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.039
Are you sure?

01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:07.340
You won't do\Nanything else, right?

01:01:07.809 --> 01:01:09.039
If someone\Nis blamed for this,

01:01:09.039 --> 01:01:10.880
they wouldn't\Njust sit around.

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:14.949
Why would I\Ncomplicate things?

01:01:17.389 --> 01:01:19.019
I'm nervous\Nabout Joo Seok.

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.990
It feels like...

01:01:21.519 --> 01:01:23.960
he's going to do\Nsomething else.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.900
Don't worry.

01:01:30.999 --> 01:01:32.970
I'll take care\Nof everything.

01:01:33.869 --> 01:01:37.110
President Ha,\Nkeep walking in the light.

01:01:37.409 --> 01:01:40.010
Don't worry\Nabout the darkness.

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:41.210
Okay?

01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:59.329
Secretary Kim,\Nthe set-up is finished.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.429
He'll probably be found by\Ncleaners in the morning.

01:02:05.999 --> 01:02:08.670
Probably between\N4:30am to 6am.

01:02:11.369 --> 01:02:12.369
Yes.

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:45.869
(Queen of Mystery 2)

01:02:46.039 --> 01:02:49.010
Someone wants to be\Ncomfortable in the lockup.

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:50.979
Let him eat what he wants.

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:53.679
Car. Charcoal.\NSuicide note.

01:02:53.679 --> 01:02:55.019
It's the same method.

01:02:55.019 --> 01:02:56.349
Sinim-dong hill.

01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:58.150
There's an old\Nprofessional planner.

01:02:58.289 --> 01:03:00.019
They said\Nthey installed...

01:03:00.019 --> 01:03:02.420
a security camera for fun\Nin the residence.

01:03:02.519 --> 01:03:03.829
A hidden camera?

01:03:04.229 --> 01:03:06.499
Does he know anything\Nabout the professor?

01:03:06.599 --> 01:03:07.800
I'll have to tell him\Neverything...

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.869
when I'm in\Nthe interrogation room.

01:03:10.429 --> 01:03:12.229
Did you get a hold\Nof the security camera?

01:03:12.499 --> 01:03:14.440
I think I know where\NSecretary Kim is.
