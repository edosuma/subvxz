00:18.218 --> 00:20.061
Solving the following riddle

00:20.220 --> 00:22.700
will reveal the awful secret
behind the universe,

00:22.856 --> 00:24.995
assuming you do not
go utterly mad in the attempt.

00:25.158 --> 00:28.196
Say you have an ax...
just a cheap one from Home Depot.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.740
- On one bitter winter day

00:30.898 --> 00:32.707
you use said ax to behead a man.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.176
Don't worry...
the man's already dead.

00:35.335 --> 00:38.179
Maybe you should worry,
'cause you're the one who shot him.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.011
He'd been a big twitchy guy

00:40.173 --> 00:42.881
with veined skin
stretched over swollen biceps,

00:43.043 --> 00:44.522
tattoo of a swastika on his tongue.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.248
And you're chopping off
his head because

00:46.413 --> 00:48.359
even with eight bullet holes in him,

00:48.515 --> 00:50.290
you're pretty sure he's about
to spring back to his feet

00:50.450 --> 00:52.589
and eat the look of terror
right off your face.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.858
You now have a broken ax.

00:55.022 --> 00:58.299
- So you go to the hardware store...

00:58.458 --> 01:02.964
...explaining away the dark reddish
stains on the handle as barbeque sauce.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.474
- The repaired ax sits undisturbed

01:05.632 --> 01:07.236
in your house until the next spring

01:07.401 --> 01:09.813
- when one rainy morning...

01:09.970 --> 01:13.816
So you grab your trusty ax
and chop the thing into several pieces.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.147
- On the last blow, however...

01:16.310 --> 01:19.314
Of course a chipped head means
yet another trip to the hardware store.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.253
As soon as you get home with
your newly-headed ax though...

01:27.387 --> 01:30.334
- You meet the reanimated body

01:30.490 --> 01:32.231
of the guy you beheaded last year,

01:32.392 --> 01:35.430
only he's got a new head
stitched on with what looks like

01:35.596 --> 01:38.668
plastic weed-trimmer line
and wears that unique expression

01:38.832 --> 01:41.005
of you're-the-man-who-killed-me-
last-winter resentment

01:41.168 --> 01:43.114
that one so rarely encounters
in everyday life.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.943
So you brandish your ax.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.110
That's the ax that slayed me.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.682
Is he right?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.060
My name is David Wong.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.364
I once saw
a man's kidney grow tentacles,

02:40.527 --> 02:42.632
tear itself out
of a ragged hole in his back

02:42.796 --> 02:44.673
and go slapping
across my kitchen floor.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.868
But that's another story.

02:51.304 --> 02:52.977
More side effects.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.518
It's always like this
when I'm on the Sauce.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.316
- I dosed six hours ago.

02:59.212 --> 03:02.921
My count had 5,829 grains
of rice on her plate.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.393
The rice was grown in Arkansas.
The guy who ran

03:05.552 --> 03:07.589
the John Deere harvester
was nicknamed Cooler.

03:11.491 --> 03:14.199
I'm not a genius.
I'm not a psychic either.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.931
Just side effects, that's all.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.837
David Wong?

03:17.998 --> 03:20.069
David Wong?

03:20.233 --> 03:22.406
What, did you doze off there?

03:22.569 --> 03:25.880
Hey, you're...
you're Arnie, right?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.417
Arnie Blondestone.
Sorry I'm late.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.953
You don't look Asian,
Mr. Wong.

03:31.111 --> 03:34.718
I'm not.
I was born right here.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.602
Had my last name changed though.
Thought it'd make me harder to find.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.698
You know that Wong is
the most common surname in the world?

03:40.854 --> 03:43.391
Mmm. Is your family still around?

03:43.557 --> 03:46.868
No, I was adopted.
I never knew my real dad.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.871
You could be my dad for all I know.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.538
Are you my dad?

03:52.699 --> 03:54.701
Uh...

03:54.868 --> 03:56.108
I don't think so, no.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.977
Anyway, my adopted family
moved away.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.483
I won't tell you
where they went, but...

04:01.641 --> 04:04.417
get out your pen, 'cause you're
gonna wanna write this down.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.650
My biological mom,
she was institutionalized.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.225
Must've been hard.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.623
She was a strung-out,
crank-addicted cannibal,

04:11.785 --> 04:14.789
dabbled in vampirism
and necromancy.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.435
Blew her welfare check
every month on black candles.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.161
Really? And I thought
my mom was bad

04:20.327 --> 04:22.807
because she wouldn't
let me watch "Space Ghost."

04:22.963 --> 04:26.274
- You pulling my leg?
- No, this is just what I do

04:26.433 --> 04:30.347
when I get nervous.
Um, she was bipolar, that's all.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.144
Couldn't keep a house.
But isn't the other story better though?

04:33.306 --> 04:35.912
- I think you should use that.
- I thought you wanted

04:36.076 --> 04:38.420
to get the truth out,
your side of it.

04:38.578 --> 04:41.684
If not, what are
we even doing here, Mr. Wong?

04:41.848 --> 04:45.125
You're right. Sorry.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.821
So you guys are...
you're what?

04:46.987 --> 04:49.991
You're some kind
of spiritualists?

04:50.157 --> 04:52.103
Exorcists?
Something like that?

04:52.259 --> 04:55.263
I could blow your world away, Arnie.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.430
If I show you
what's in this container,

04:57.597 --> 04:59.474
you'll never feel at one
with the human race

04:59.633 --> 05:01.112
until the day you die.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.441
You ever shit yourself, Arnie?

05:03.603 --> 05:06.777
'Cause you would've
if you'd been there last night.

05:12.379 --> 05:16.156
He's a seeker
of truth in an age of fear.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.160
- Marconi.
- He is willing to face down

05:19.319 --> 05:22.300
- the legions of evil.
- Marconi.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.560
He will help his fellow man

05:24.724 --> 05:27.068
to find a path into the light.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.638
Marconi.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.581
- Hello?
- Hey, this is John.

05:44.744 --> 05:47.190
Your pimp says bring
the crack shipment tonight

05:47.347 --> 05:48.849
or he'll be forced to stick you.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.086
Meet him where
we buried the Korean whore...

05:51.251 --> 05:53.094
the one without the goatee.

05:53.253 --> 05:55.233
That was John's code.

05:55.388 --> 05:57.231
It meant "Bring your gear
and come to my place

05:57.390 --> 05:59.267
as soon as you can.
It's important."

05:59.426 --> 06:01.428
John, it's 3:00
in the morning, man.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.199
Oh, and don't forget...

06:03.363 --> 06:05.866
tomorrow's the day
we kill the president.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.534
- John.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.114
That last part was code
for "Stop and pick me up some beer

06:11.271 --> 06:13.046
on the way."

06:38.131 --> 06:40.634
Dave. Come in.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.744
- Dave, this is Shelly.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.080
She needs our help.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.388
So, Shelly, tell us your story.

06:54.547 --> 06:57.221
It's my boyfriend.
He won't leave me alone.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.830
He's been harassing me
for the past week.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.262
I'm terrified to go home.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.129
- Miss...
- Morris.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.895
Miss Morris,

07:06.059 --> 07:07.936
I'd strongly recommend
a women's shelter.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.903
They can help you get

07:10.063 --> 07:12.407
- a restraining order...
- My boyfriend...

07:13.733 --> 07:16.304
has been dead for two months.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.822
I didn't know where else to go.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.356
I heard through a friend
that you guys handle...

07:27.514 --> 07:29.653
unusual problems.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.262
Shelly, when he comes,
you can see him?

07:32.419 --> 07:34.592
Yes, and I can hear him.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.971
- He hits you?
- Man, what a dick!

07:44.130 --> 07:46.132
Shelly, in our experience,

07:46.299 --> 07:48.438
spiritual beings
that can manipulate objects

07:48.601 --> 07:50.603
in the physical world are rare.

07:50.770 --> 07:54.115
Uh, look, Miss Morris,
I really don't think...

07:54.274 --> 07:56.151
I told her
that we'd look into this tonight.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.516
I thought that maybe
you and I could go over there

07:58.678 --> 08:00.817
and show this bastard what's what.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.470
So where do you see him mostly?

08:14.627 --> 08:17.039
In the basement.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.509
And once in the bathroom

08:22.669 --> 08:24.671
when I was on the toilet,
he stuck his hand

08:24.838 --> 08:26.408
- through the seat once.
- Okay, just...

08:26.573 --> 08:28.211
just show us the basement door.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.211
It's that way.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.901
- Well...

08:51.064 --> 08:53.601
- he's not here.
- Big surprise.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.172
She seems like a nice girl,
doesn't she?

08:57.337 --> 09:00.443
She reminds me of Amber... Amy's friend.
When she came to my door tonight

09:00.607 --> 09:02.287
I actually thought
it was her for a second.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.742
Oh, by the way, Dave, I wanted
to thank you for coming along.

09:04.844 --> 09:07.188
I'm not saying I'm gonna take advantage
of her distress or anything, but...

09:07.347 --> 09:10.021
Aw, jeez.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.861
Ooh.
Guy must've been a hunter.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.728
Wait. John.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.964
Did I hear you say that you thought
that she looked like Amber?

09:22.128 --> 09:25.234
- Yeah.
- John, Amber's almost as tall as me.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.936
Like, just under six feet,
blonde hair, kinda top-heavy.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.207
Yeah, I know.
She's cute as hell, right?

09:31.371 --> 09:34.580
Yeah, and you think
that Shelly looks like her?

09:34.741 --> 09:38.052
- The girl sitting upstairs?
- Yeah.

09:38.211 --> 09:41.215
John, Shelly's short.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.928
Short with dark hair,

09:45.085 --> 09:46.962
blue eyes.

09:48.655 --> 09:52.569
God damn it.
I knew she was too good to be true.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.807
Uh, Shelly.

10:01.968 --> 10:04.744
John and I are having
a bit of a problem here.

10:04.904 --> 10:07.646
We're both seeing completely
different versions of you.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.481
Now John here has eyesight problems

10:10.643 --> 10:14.489
'cause of his constant masturbation,
but I don't think...

10:22.689 --> 10:25.329
Oh! God!

10:25.492 --> 10:27.494
Ah! Oh!

10:30.830 --> 10:33.811
Ah! Ah! Oh.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.880
- That door cannot be opened!
- No.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.112
They love to play games, don't they?

10:41.274 --> 10:43.151
- It's all they have time for.

11:34.894 --> 11:37.773
You disappoint me.
All these years we've dueled.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.673
You will never defeat me, Marconi.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.835
Wait, Dr. Albert Marconi?
The guy who hosts

11:43.002 --> 11:45.278
the "Magical Mystery" show
on the Culture Channel?

11:45.438 --> 11:48.044
You dumb-ass. Marconi?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.881
Marconi's like 50 years old.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.454
The guy's got white hair.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.022
We're not your nemesis.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.921
Okay, I'll tell you what...
if we can get you in touch with Marconi

11:58.084 --> 12:00.462
so you two can work out your
little differences, will you release us?

12:00.620 --> 12:03.601
- You lie!
- No no no, we're in the same business.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.259
- We got a direct line. Here.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.370
Marconi! Marconi!

12:12.532 --> 12:16.878
Marconi! Marconi! Marconi!

12:17.036 --> 12:19.607
<i>- Monsieur?</i>

12:37.390 --> 12:39.267
- Yes?
<i>- S'il vous plaît.</i>

12:39.425 --> 12:42.565
...unseen forces
swirling around us, willing to

12:42.729 --> 12:45.005
- face down the legions of evil...
- Yes.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.667
...and helping
his fellow man to find the path

12:47.834 --> 12:49.780
from darkness into the light.

12:49.936 --> 12:53.577
From sold-out engagements
in Rome, Tel Aviv,

12:53.740 --> 12:56.983
- Madison Square Garden and Las Vegas...
- Sir.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.487
- Hello, Doctor.

12:59.646 --> 13:02.820
Uh, yeah, John is feeling better.
Thank you for asking.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.963
I'm afraid we have
a situation 53 here.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.826
Mm-hmm.

13:07.987 --> 13:11.764
Yeah, would you be willing to speak
directly to the manifestation?

13:11.924 --> 13:13.301
Okay, yeah, I will.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.203
We have a deal?

13:23.670 --> 13:27.049
So we meet again, Marconi.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.482
You thought...

13:33.379 --> 13:37.020
Damn. He's good.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.855
Marconi. Marconi.

13:42.789 --> 13:46.794
- Marconi. Marconi.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.802
Spiritualists? Exorcists?

13:48.961 --> 13:51.339
You guys already have a bit
of a following though, don't ya?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.841
I found a couple
of discussion boards on the web

13:54.000 --> 13:55.377
devoted to you and your friend

13:55.535 --> 13:58.141
and your... hobby, I guess.

13:58.304 --> 14:01.842
Okay, I'm not farting around.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.545
You have 83¢
in your front pocket, Arnie...

14:04.711 --> 14:07.021
three quarters,
a nickel, three pennies.

14:07.180 --> 14:11.686
The pennies are dated
1983, 1993 and 1999.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.005
Well, I'll be damned.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.512
That's a neat trick, Mr. Wong.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.631
If you flip the nickel 10 times,
you'll get heads,

14:33.740 --> 14:36.186
heads, tails, heads, tails,
tails, tails, heads, tails, tails.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.183
I don't think I wanna
take the time to do that.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.554
Last night you had
a dream, Arnie.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.557
You dreamt you were being chased
through the forest by your mother.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.923
She was lashing you with a whip

14:46.085 --> 14:48.964
made of knotted penises.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.737
That's right, Arnie.
Everything you know is wrong.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.310
You've got my attention,
Mr. Wong.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.207
Oh, it gets better.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.473
A lot better.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.083
Bullshit. What it gets is worse.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.311
A lot worse.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.388
It started just
a couple of years ago.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.821
We were just a year
or two out of high school,

15:14.981 --> 15:17.757
- just kids.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.658
So that friend of mine, John,

15:19.819 --> 15:21.457
he had a band.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.298
I once knew a man...

15:26.893 --> 15:29.840
actually, I made that up.
One, two, three, four!

16:08.601 --> 16:11.480
Telling the story now,
I'm tempted to say something like,

16:11.637 --> 16:13.480
"Who would've thought
my friend John would help

16:13.639 --> 16:15.312
bring about the end of the world?"

16:37.697 --> 16:39.677
- Hey, Fred.
- Hey.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.678
Here's to all
of the kisses I've snatched

16:43.836 --> 16:45.975
and vice-versa.

16:47.373 --> 16:48.909
- Amen.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.679
Justin.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.379
Girl, what you thinking?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.320
- Justin, please!
- Get your hand off me.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.187
Please give it back to me, Justin.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.386
- Please?

17:00.820 --> 17:04.165
Please give it back to me, Justin.

17:04.323 --> 17:06.323
- Get your hand off me, girl.
- No!

17:12.164 --> 17:14.770
Could I have that back, please?

17:22.040 --> 17:26.387
Umm, hey, you're...
you're Amy, right?

17:26.546 --> 17:28.025
Um...

17:28.180 --> 17:29.682
do you want a beer?

17:30.683 --> 17:32.629
No, my dog just...

17:32.785 --> 17:35.197
bit some Jamaican guy.
I've got to go find him.

17:35.354 --> 17:38.597
Man, my uncle lost a foot
in his riding mower.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.198
Says you can still feel it.
What's that... what's that called?

17:41.227 --> 17:45.369
Fantasy leg situation
or something like that?

17:45.531 --> 17:47.977
It's called phantom limb syndrome,

17:48.134 --> 17:50.444
and all amputees get it
and it goes away.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.406
Asshole.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.820
Good one, Fred.

18:09.121 --> 18:12.295
I'm floating, man.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.802
- And that's real magic, man.
- What's up?

18:14.961 --> 18:17.407
Is there some guy exposing
himself over there?

18:17.563 --> 18:19.099
Oh my God,
that guy just levitated...

18:19.265 --> 18:22.474
- right off the ground.
- How high?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.342
- Wow.
- Ooh.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.585
You gotta love the skeptic, man.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.276
Lemme guess...

18:29.442 --> 18:32.286
about six inches
above the grass, right?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.254
Balducci levitation?

18:34.413 --> 18:38.793
Let's see. What can I do
to impress Mr. Skeptic Man here?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.953
Ah, look at there.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.327
You forgot to wash behind
your ears there, didn't ya?

18:44.690 --> 18:46.499
It's a quarter, right?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.275
Well, the bug's a nice touch.

18:52.431 --> 18:54.809
- Oh.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.503
Do you dream, man?

18:56.669 --> 18:59.548
I interpret dreams... for a beer.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.345
Well, I don't have any beer,

19:02.508 --> 19:04.681
so I guess I'm out of luck.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.881
I'll tell you what I'll do,
Mr. Skeptic Man.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.052
I'll do it like Daniel
in the Old Testament.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.322
I'll tell you
the last dream that you had

19:13.486 --> 19:16.023
and then I'll break down
it's meaning for ya.

19:16.188 --> 19:19.829
And if I'm right, you owe me a beer.
Okay, man?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.635
Sure.

19:22.795 --> 19:26.004
I mean, you've obviously been blessed
with supernatural gifts.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.578
What better way to use them
than to fish for free beer at parties?

19:30.636 --> 19:32.206
You had this one

19:32.371 --> 19:34.544
early this morning

19:34.707 --> 19:36.414
in the middle
of the thunderstorm.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.418
And in the dream, you were back

19:38.577 --> 19:40.682
with your girlfriend Tina.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.417
Whoa. How'd he know that?

19:43.582 --> 19:46.062
And you come home
and she's there

19:46.218 --> 19:48.027
with this big
honking pile of dynamite

19:48.187 --> 19:51.066
and one of them
cartoon plunger detonators,

19:51.223 --> 19:53.032
ready to blow.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.001
And you say,
"What you doing?"

19:55.161 --> 19:58.540
And she says, "This," and boom.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.177
Your eyes snap open

20:00.332 --> 20:03.211
and the explosion
at the end of the dream

20:03.369 --> 20:06.179
become the clap of thunder
outside of your window.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.287
So tell me, man... am I close?

20:11.444 --> 20:14.050
Holy shit.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.590
Okay.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.285
You made a lucky guess.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.932
You see?
You gotta ask yourself, man...

20:22.088 --> 20:27.299
you gotta be really brave to ask
yourself the scary questions.

20:27.460 --> 20:31.135
How did your mind know, David,

20:31.297 --> 20:33.800
- that the thunder was coming?
- How'd you know my...

20:33.966 --> 20:37.641
The thunder came right as she hit
the detonator at the end of your dream.

20:37.803 --> 20:41.546
Your mind started the dream
30 seconds before the thunder.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.620
Now how did the mind know
that the thunder was coming?

20:44.777 --> 20:47.314
Hmm?

20:47.480 --> 20:48.754
Because...

20:49.815 --> 20:52.318
time is an ocean...

20:52.485 --> 20:54.294
not a garden hose.

20:54.453 --> 20:57.764
Space is a puff of smoke,
a wisp of cloud.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.295
Your mind...

21:02.394 --> 21:04.169
is a flying corn snake,

21:04.330 --> 21:07.937
hovering through
all the possibilities.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.341
Whatever.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.851
You want to know
where your papa really was

21:15.007 --> 21:16.987
when you were in hospital
with broke leg?

21:18.778 --> 21:21.657
Do you want me to tell you
the name of your soulmate?

21:21.814 --> 21:24.021
Or how she'll die?

21:26.452 --> 21:30.332
Do you want to know when the first
nuclear bomb will hit American soil?

21:31.457 --> 21:33.164
Or in which city?

21:35.995 --> 21:40.000
Hey, man!
You owe me a beer, man!

21:50.442 --> 21:52.945
Three Ann Sally! Three Arm Sally!

21:53.112 --> 21:55.956
- Oh. Where'd you come from?

21:57.616 --> 21:59.289
- Good dog.

22:01.453 --> 22:03.490
- Oh.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.158
Help yourself.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.838
Okay, Bark Lee,

22:16.001 --> 22:17.742
you and me'll go visit Amy,

22:17.903 --> 22:20.076
see if we can't get back
in her good graces.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.946
- John, what's going on?

22:51.103 --> 22:53.208
I can't get out of my apartment.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.215
- What?
- I'm scared, Dave.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.285
I mean it.
It... it can't be real. It can't.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.514
The way that it moves,
the way it's made...

22:59.678 --> 23:02.124
this is not a product
of any kind of evolution or anything,

23:02.281 --> 23:03.561
but it still managed to bite me.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.559
- What?
- Can you come over?

23:05.718 --> 23:08.289
- Yeah, I'll be there in 12 minutes.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.865
- Oh!

23:15.427 --> 23:16.804
John?

23:26.972 --> 23:28.383
John?

23:30.209 --> 23:33.053
John.
John, I'm gonna call the police.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.123
- Oh!

23:35.281 --> 23:37.955
It almost killed you!
You're a fucking idiot. You know that?

23:38.117 --> 23:40.495
- Now we're both gonna die!

23:40.653 --> 23:42.394
- You ready? Go!
- Yeah. Ahh.

23:42.554 --> 23:44.591
Ahh! Ahh.

23:45.758 --> 23:46.759
John?

23:50.496 --> 23:52.942
Do not move.
- What?

23:53.098 --> 23:55.738
I know you don't believe me,
but when you turn around, you will.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.006
Don't scream.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.081
If you scream, you're dead.

24:00.239 --> 24:03.186
Now, very slowly, turn around.

24:05.844 --> 24:07.289
There! It moved!

24:07.446 --> 24:09.585
John, you can either come
with me to the hospital

24:09.748 --> 24:11.455
or I'm gonna call
an ambulance, all right?

24:11.617 --> 24:13.187
But I'm not gonna just
stand around

24:13.352 --> 24:15.072
- in your apartment while you...

24:15.087 --> 24:17.124
Door! Go!

25:05.237 --> 25:06.875
Get in the car.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.589
- Why don't you tell me what this is?
- You don't want to touch that.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.388
You shouldn't have come here.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.395
- You called me. You begged me.
- What? I did?

25:22.554 --> 25:25.091
- When?
- Just tell me what this stuff is, John.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.863
They're gonna ask me,
so just tell me before you fall asleep.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.940
All right, I remember now.
I was... I remember calling you.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.666
It's hard, okay,
'cause everything's running together.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.607
I kept calling you.
I kept calling and calling and calling.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.679
I bet I called you like 20 times.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.611
You kept getting all weird on me.

25:39.772 --> 25:42.013
You know what I think? You're gonna
be getting phone calls from me

25:42.174 --> 25:44.347
for the next eight or nine years...
all from tonight.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.512
I couldn't help it.
I couldn't get oriented.

25:46.678 --> 25:48.385
It was like I kept slipping out of time.

25:50.783 --> 25:53.855
- No, wait. Where are we gonna go?

25:54.019 --> 25:56.397
- Emergency room, John.
- What? No. No. No.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.475
Yeah. I don't know what else to do.
I'm not gonna play this game with you.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.471
Hey, let's go to your place
or something. Any place but here.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.699
Someplace safe.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.742
So you don't know
the name of the drug?

26:08.901 --> 26:11.021
Robert called it "the Soy Sauce,"
but now I'm thinking

26:11.136 --> 26:13.337
that was just the nickname.
It's not actually soy sauce.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.113
- Wait-Robert?
- The guy with...

26:15.274 --> 26:17.220
Oh, right yeah,
the fake magical Jamaican.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.481
- What was his last name?
- Marley.

26:19.645 --> 26:22.455
Ah. Of course.
Robert Marley.

26:22.614 --> 26:24.389
And that guy's the one
who gave you the...

26:24.550 --> 26:26.552
We were
in the One Ball parking lot, right?

26:26.718 --> 26:28.561
Just passing around ajoint.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.064
That Jamaican guy...

26:31.223 --> 26:33.726
he pulls out this Sauce and goes,

26:33.892 --> 26:37.339
"It be
opening doors to other worlds, man."

26:39.465 --> 26:40.569
Did anyone else take it?

26:40.732 --> 26:42.837
That stuff, Dave,

26:43.001 --> 26:45.345
I'm remembering things
that haven't happened yet.

26:45.504 --> 26:48.815
- I mean that didn't happen.
- John, answer my question.

26:48.974 --> 26:51.079
- Did anyone else take the Sauce?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.189
I don't know!
That's what I'm trying to say!

26:53.345 --> 26:54.983
We went to Robert's trailer...

26:55.147 --> 26:56.990
Andy and those guys,
they didn't want to come.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.549
I think they got freaked out
when they saw a needle come out.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.689
And you still actually tried that shit?

27:01.854 --> 27:03.834
Are you kidding me?
How could I not?

27:03.989 --> 27:07.300
- Dave, please please please,

27:07.459 --> 27:08.995
answer your phone
or just turn it off.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.538
Okay, all right.

27:12.931 --> 27:14.808
- Yeah?
- Dave?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.503
It's me.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.475
- Is this a recording?
- What? No.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.679
Look, I don't know if we've talked
tonight but we don't have much time.

27:25.844 --> 27:28.791
I think I called you and told you
to come here. If so, don't do it.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.188
If I haven't called,
then obviously you shouldn't.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.557
- Just stay away, regardless.
- Who is this?

27:33.719 --> 27:35.460
It's John.
Can you hear me?

27:35.621 --> 27:38.227
I can hear you and I can see you.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.131
You're sitting right here next to me.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.238
Well, then just talk
to me in person then.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.238
Oh wait, do I look like
I'm injured in any way?

27:45.397 --> 27:47.536
- What?
- Shh. I'm sorry, I gotta go.

27:47.699 --> 27:49.144
- Say hello to me.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.983
Was that me?

27:56.508 --> 27:57.816
It was me, wasn't it?

28:00.846 --> 28:03.918
I'm sorry, Dave.

28:04.082 --> 28:07.996
No, I really am. I'm sorry
for messing up your sleep cycle.

28:08.153 --> 28:09.313
Come on, get in the car.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.231
I'm sorry for everything
that's gonna happen.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.098
All the people that are gonna...

28:14.259 --> 28:17.206
explode.

28:19.831 --> 28:22.107
John. John, wake up.

28:22.267 --> 28:23.905
He's still breathing.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.588
Fuck it.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.602
Saint Dom's.

28:56.768 --> 28:58.975
Uh, hi.
I need a priest.

28:59.137 --> 29:00.582
Well, this is Father Shelnut.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.379
- What can I do for you?
- Do you...

29:03.542 --> 29:05.579
have any experience with, like...

29:05.744 --> 29:07.280
demonism?

29:07.446 --> 29:09.585
Like hauntings,
possessions and all that?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.989
Look, people say they see things

29:12.150 --> 29:15.723
or hear voices in their head,
we generally refer them to a counselor.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.163
No no no. No no.
I'm not crazy.

29:18.323 --> 29:21.770
- Other people have...
- No, I didn't mean to imply that.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.668
Why don't you come talk to me?

29:23.829 --> 29:27.003
And then even if you need
to see a professional,

29:27.165 --> 29:29.406
I've got a brother-in-law
who's real good.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.811
- What do you think it's like, Father?
- What's what like?

29:32.971 --> 29:35.315
Being crazy, mentally ill.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.284
Well, they never know
they're ill, do they?

29:38.443 --> 29:42.357
I mean, you can't diagnose yourself with
the same organ that has the disease,

29:42.514 --> 29:44.619
just like you can't see
your own eyeball.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.660
I suppose you just feel regular

29:46.818 --> 29:49.697
and the rest of the world seems
to go crazy around you.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.165
But let's just suppose
that I actually...

29:52.324 --> 29:55.703
I mean, in reality,
ran into something from beyond the...

29:55.861 --> 29:57.204
- Oh fuck!

29:57.362 --> 30:00.935
Ah!

30:01.099 --> 30:03.101
Ah.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.944
I'll try
to explain this without cursing,

30:08.106 --> 30:09.949
but the black shit
from Planet X that came out

30:10.108 --> 30:12.349
from that motherfucker
looked like it had grown hair.

30:12.511 --> 30:15.856
Did I mention that the stuff
was moving? Twitching?

30:25.390 --> 30:27.563
Uh, hello?
Are you still there?

30:27.726 --> 30:30.002
Yes, son, I am.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.199
Just keep calm, okay?

30:32.364 --> 30:34.970
Nothing you're seeing is real.

30:35.133 --> 30:38.637
I could feel it,
that strange venomous warmth

30:38.804 --> 30:40.477
spreading through my thigh.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.586
Look, I appreciate your time, but...

30:43.742 --> 30:46.102
I'm starting to think there's
nothing you can do to help me.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.158
Son, I'm going
to be honest with you.

30:48.313 --> 30:51.317
We both know you're fucked.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.394
Excuse me?

30:53.552 --> 30:56.556
Your mom writes on the walls
with her own shit.

30:56.722 --> 31:00.363
Great changes are coming
to Deadworld, my son...

31:00.525 --> 31:03.506
waves of maggots
over oceans of rot.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.608
You'll see it, David.

31:05.764 --> 31:08.040
You'll see it with your own eyes.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.907
Do you understand?

31:51.243 --> 31:52.916
Be calm.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.615
- Drive.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.496
- Ah.
- Drive.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.636
Just drive.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.900
Wanna... ahh!

32:13.064 --> 32:14.668
John! John!

32:14.833 --> 32:16.574
John, wake up!

32:19.271 --> 32:22.741
- Who the fuck are you?

32:24.943 --> 32:27.355
- My name is Roger North.

32:27.512 --> 32:29.992
Congratulations.
Now who the fuck are you

32:30.148 --> 32:32.424
and what's this fucking thing
you've got on my chest?!

32:32.584 --> 32:34.962
My interest is only in you.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.795
It is said out
of genuine concern for your safety.

32:40.158 --> 32:43.264
A very important role
you must play.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.640
Korrok is a powerful adversary.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.777
Things are in motion, Mr. Wong.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.279
- Fascinating.
- What?

32:56.441 --> 32:59.820
They harvest insects here,
do they not? For their honey?

33:01.279 --> 33:04.123
Do the bees know that
they make the honey for you

33:04.282 --> 33:08.492
or do their work tirelessly because
they think it is their own choice?

33:08.653 --> 33:10.189
- Have you ever noticed

33:10.355 --> 33:12.892
when you hear a word
for the very first time in your life,

33:13.058 --> 33:16.870
you will hear that word
again within 24 hours?

33:17.028 --> 33:20.566
Do you ever wonder
why sometimes you'll see

33:20.732 --> 33:24.646
a single shoe
lying alongside the road?

33:30.008 --> 33:32.545
I've been watching you
for some time,

33:32.711 --> 33:35.692
but there are great gaps
in my knowledge.

33:35.847 --> 33:40.557
Do you know I observed a man
who masturbated until he bled?

33:40.719 --> 33:42.027
Did he want to do that?

33:42.187 --> 33:44.064
And you, when you're alone...

34:05.343 --> 34:07.550
Okay. Okay.

34:08.679 --> 34:12.025
This thing I got pointed at you...
you know what it does?

34:13.217 --> 34:15.960
I believe I have an idea, yes.

34:16.121 --> 34:18.726
And are you familiar
with the old human saying

34:18.889 --> 34:21.097
"I want to shoot you so bad,
my dick's hard"?

34:22.260 --> 34:24.297
I don't believe I do.

34:24.462 --> 34:26.737
Maybe you'll hear it again
in the next 24 hours

34:26.898 --> 34:28.467
if you don't try to fuck with me.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.742
Now shut up and don't move.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.330
Things are in motion, huh?

34:59.898 --> 35:02.970
- Huh. Nice work, Bark Lee.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.155
David Wong?

35:16.514 --> 35:19.859
- Yeah.
- Detective Lawrence Appleton.

35:20.018 --> 35:22.760
Would you please step out of the car?
You and your friend?

35:22.921 --> 35:24.093
He's...

35:25.090 --> 35:26.296
resting.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.995
Get the fuck out of the car.

35:33.431 --> 35:36.605
I want to thank you
for coming down, Mr. Wong.

35:38.003 --> 35:39.710
I bet it's been quite
a night for you, huh?

35:39.871 --> 35:41.612
Where's John?

35:41.773 --> 35:45.550
Oh, he's fine.
He's talking to another officer

35:45.710 --> 35:49.351
- a few rooms from here.
- John... he's talking? Really?

35:49.514 --> 35:51.994
Since you're both gonna tell me
the unvarnished truth,

35:52.150 --> 35:54.460
you don't have to worry
about your stories matching.

35:54.619 --> 35:57.395
Do you?
Just tell me what you did last night.

35:57.555 --> 35:59.831
Well, I went to a party by the lake.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.993
I left around midnight.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.833
I was asleep by 2:00.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.975
Ooh, you sure about that?

36:06.131 --> 36:08.042
You sure you didn't go over
to the One Ball Inn?

36:08.199 --> 36:11.043
You know, on Grand Avenue?
Grab a nightcap?

36:11.202 --> 36:12.840
Your buddies were all there.

36:13.004 --> 36:16.008
No, I had work in the morning.
I went straight home.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.246
As I spoke, a strange jittery energy

36:19.411 --> 36:22.483
began to rise up in me,
radiating from the chest out.

36:22.647 --> 36:25.821
At that moment, things began
to clarify and become simple.

36:25.984 --> 36:29.193
All of a sudden I was startled to find
I could see the cop's next question

36:29.354 --> 36:31.095
before he spoke it...
word for word.

36:31.256 --> 36:33.702
- "Have you heard the name..."
- Have you heard the name

36:33.858 --> 36:36.532
Nathan Curry?
A guy about your age.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.369
His parents own a body shop
right here in town.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.532
No.

36:40.699 --> 36:41.871
"How about Shelby Winder?"

36:42.033 --> 36:44.070
How about Shelby Winder?

36:44.235 --> 36:47.444
Heavy girl.
Senior at East Side High.

36:47.605 --> 36:50.245
- Justin White?
- No, sorry.

36:50.408 --> 36:52.217
What happened?

36:52.377 --> 36:54.084
Everything was obvious now.

36:54.245 --> 36:56.122
All the walls of the maze
turned to glass.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.560
This list of people had
all been at the party last night

37:00.719 --> 37:02.790
and they were all now dead
or heading there.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.958
How do you know that?
How do you know any of this?

37:06.124 --> 37:08.627
Magic?
You know damn well why.

37:08.793 --> 37:11.205
That black shit John took
made blood contact with you.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.535
- Now you're getting high, partner,

37:13.698 --> 37:17.043
on the Soy Sauce.
It's got you.

37:17.202 --> 37:19.808
At least nine people
at the One Ball Inn

37:19.971 --> 37:21.973
at closing time 12 hours ago...

37:22.140 --> 37:24.643
three are missing.
Your friend is here.

37:24.809 --> 37:26.880
The rest are dead.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.787
Your friend is
the only known survivor

37:29.948 --> 37:31.484
of the One Ball Nine.

37:31.649 --> 37:34.425
And now don't take
offense at this...

37:34.586 --> 37:37.590
but he's not looking
too healthy right about now.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.667
Did he say anything this morning?

37:39.824 --> 37:41.804
John called me last night,
talking crazy...

37:41.960 --> 37:45.305
paranoia, hallucinations, the whole
monsters-in-his-apartment bit.

37:45.463 --> 37:47.823
Said he couldn't remember
how he got where he was like that.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.936
Did he say what he was on?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.141
No.

37:52.303 --> 37:54.078
You know we'll
find out anyway, right?

37:54.239 --> 37:55.946
I'm not interested
in booking a bunch

37:56.107 --> 37:58.018
of your raver buddies
for popping pills.

37:58.176 --> 38:01.089
To somebody like me,
dead bodies are what matters.

38:01.246 --> 38:04.125
Now if somebody is out there
selling poison...

38:04.282 --> 38:06.159
I would tell you if I knew.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.358
So what, that's how everyone died?

38:11.523 --> 38:13.127
Overdose?

38:15.794 --> 38:18.468
What about that guy?
You know him?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.166
Yeah, he was there.

38:20.331 --> 38:22.709
Whatever John had,
he got it from this guy.

38:22.867 --> 38:25.848
That's Bruce Matthews.
He runs an amateur

38:26.004 --> 38:28.143
unlicensed pharmaceutical operation

38:28.306 --> 38:30.843
on the corner
of 30th and Lexington.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.488
And those?

38:32.644 --> 38:33.782
Before.

38:35.213 --> 38:36.385
After.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.293
What could even
do that to a person?

38:44.455 --> 38:46.492
Like a bomb or some kind of...

38:46.658 --> 38:49.036
Nothing you'd know how to do.
I'm sure of that.

38:49.194 --> 38:52.903
Maybe it's something not within
the bounds of our familiarity.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.873
- What I...

38:55.033 --> 38:57.206
Sir, we need you
in the other room now.

39:02.307 --> 39:04.378
Hey, what the hell's going on?

39:04.542 --> 39:06.317
God damn it.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.333
Your friend...

39:19.691 --> 39:21.602
- he's dead.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.739
Sorry. Hold on.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.738
So, uh...

39:25.897 --> 39:28.935
black stuff...
this Soy Sauce.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.943
That's a drug, right?

39:31.102 --> 39:33.673
- Oh, I'll get to that.
- It makes you smarter when you take it.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.579
It lets you read minds
and all that.

39:35.740 --> 39:39.449
It heightens your senses, I think.

39:39.611 --> 39:43.286
I don't know. It's like...
when you're on it, it's like overload.

39:43.448 --> 39:45.291
Like if you hooked
your car radio up

39:45.450 --> 39:47.862
to one of those interplanetary
SETI antennas,

39:48.019 --> 39:50.295
you just get shit
from all over the place.

39:50.455 --> 39:53.265
You can see things
you shouldn't be able to.

39:53.424 --> 39:55.097
And you've still got
some of this stuff?

39:56.561 --> 40:00.373
- I'm getting to that.
- You're on it right now.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.879
You're on it right now

40:04.035 --> 40:06.037
and that's how you did
the whole thing

40:06.204 --> 40:09.048
with the coins and the dreams
and all that earlier.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.154
Yeah, I took some today.

40:12.310 --> 40:15.484
- It's fading though.
- The effects don't last that long?

40:15.647 --> 40:17.320
The side effects
don't last that long.

40:17.482 --> 40:20.622
The effects will last
the rest of my life, I think.

40:20.785 --> 40:22.890
Maybe longer.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.432
Wow. Okay, so...
so wait a minute.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.967
The kids that died...

40:27.125 --> 40:29.731
that was that
rave overdose, wasn't it?

40:29.894 --> 40:32.615
I remember all that... a couple
of years ago, seeing that on the news.

40:32.630 --> 40:34.837
I thought they got ahold
of some tainted ecstasy or something.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.001
- You're the guy...
- Something like that.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.774
Okay, so if I contact this...

40:39.938 --> 40:42.680
Detective Appleton,
he'll remember talking to you?

40:42.840 --> 40:45.480
Good luck finding him.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.285
So what do you think?

40:49.447 --> 40:52.189
Huh, well...

40:52.350 --> 40:54.523
I think you've got a book here,

40:54.686 --> 40:56.597
probably,
if you flesh it out a little bit.

40:56.754 --> 40:58.756
A book?

40:58.923 --> 41:01.870
Meaning a work of fiction?
Meaning it's all bullshit?

41:02.026 --> 41:04.199
Hey, a story's a story.

41:04.362 --> 41:05.932
I'm just a feature reporter,

41:06.097 --> 41:09.510
so the fact that you think
it happened is my story.

41:09.667 --> 41:13.638
You know, I don't remember leaving
the house with any coins in my pocket.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.366
I think you could've
slipped them to me.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.884
Without you feeling it?

41:17.041 --> 41:19.885
And the thing with the dream?
Come on, Arnie.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.955
I think you're trying
to be one of those...

41:22.113 --> 41:25.959
one of those mentalists,
like that Dr. Marconi on TV.

41:26.117 --> 41:29.394
Dr. Marconi may be theatrical,

41:29.554 --> 41:32.535
but believe me, he's not an act.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.795
Well, I caught Marconi's act in Vegas,

41:34.959 --> 41:37.963
and your story sounds like a lot
of the same kind of hocus-pocus to me.

41:42.633 --> 41:45.239
Come with me.
I wanna show you something.

41:45.403 --> 41:48.475
- Where are we going?
- Just out to my truck.

41:50.641 --> 41:53.247
- All right.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.593
- You see it?

42:00.051 --> 42:03.897
No. Or, you know,
it's an empty cage.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.566
Turn your head
so you're looking at me.

42:06.724 --> 42:09.500
Yup.

42:09.660 --> 42:12.732
Now you should see the box
just out of the corner of your eye.

42:12.897 --> 42:15.036
Let's go back inside.
Your story was more interesting.

42:15.199 --> 42:17.941
You're gonna die, Arnie.
Someday you will face that moment.

42:18.102 --> 42:20.912
And at that moment you will face
either complete nonexistence

42:21.072 --> 42:23.780
or you will face
something even stranger.

42:23.941 --> 42:26.512
On an actual day
in the future, Arnie,

42:26.677 --> 42:29.123
you will be
in the unimaginable.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.920
It is physically
impossible to avoid it.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.563
Think about that. Now,

42:34.719 --> 42:36.926
without turning your head,

42:37.088 --> 42:39.068
look at the box.

42:45.430 --> 42:47.467
Ah! Shit!

42:49.200 --> 42:51.043
Oh shit shit!

42:51.202 --> 42:52.977
Shit!
What the shit is that?

42:54.972 --> 42:56.110
Wait a minute.

42:56.274 --> 42:58.276
How the fuck did you do that?

42:58.443 --> 43:00.320
What the fuck is that thing?

43:00.478 --> 43:02.458
What the fuck, man?

43:02.613 --> 43:04.320
There's no name for it in this world.

43:04.482 --> 43:06.120
It's pretty freaky though, right?

43:06.284 --> 43:07.661
Wait. No no no no. You...

43:07.819 --> 43:09.992
you made me see something.

43:10.154 --> 43:11.914
You made me see something
out of my own head.

43:11.956 --> 43:14.436
You freaked me out
so that I would see something.

43:14.592 --> 43:15.832
No, it's really there.

43:15.993 --> 43:18.098
I'm surprised
you saw it so easily though.

43:18.262 --> 43:20.139
You must have an open mind.

43:20.298 --> 43:23.245
Most people only see it
that fast if they're stoned or drunk.

43:26.003 --> 43:27.983
I want to tell the rest
of my story, Arnie.

43:29.307 --> 43:31.253
I need to.
I need to get it out.

43:31.409 --> 43:34.947
But you have to take it
for what it is...

43:36.481 --> 43:39.485
- the truth.
- Okay.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.620
Until I figure it out for real.

43:44.856 --> 43:46.494
Okay.

43:46.657 --> 43:47.965
Eh, that'll have to do.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.167
Come on.

43:54.332 --> 43:57.176
Anyway, so the cop comes in,

43:57.335 --> 43:59.212
tells me that John is dead.

43:59.370 --> 44:00.508
Your friend...

44:00.671 --> 44:01.945
he's dead.

44:02.106 --> 44:04.643
What? How?

44:04.809 --> 44:07.050
- Calm down. Calm down.

44:07.211 --> 44:10.283
He went into convulsions or something.
His pulse stopped.

44:10.448 --> 44:13.019
We've got ambulances.
One will be here in 30 seconds.

44:13.184 --> 44:15.027
We've got Vinnie doing CPR on him.

44:15.186 --> 44:17.393
Vinnie is a lifeguard in his off hours.

44:17.555 --> 44:19.330
Now you listen to me, boy.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.026
Here's what you're gonna do.

44:21.192 --> 44:23.069
I'll be back in five minutes

44:23.227 --> 44:25.400
and then you are gonna
tell me the truth.

44:25.563 --> 44:28.009
And if you obstruct me in any way,

44:28.166 --> 44:31.739
you're gonna live the rest
of your days wishing you had not.

44:46.384 --> 44:47.920
Yeah?

44:48.085 --> 44:50.224
Dave, this is John.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.935
What? Did you get out?

44:55.092 --> 44:58.073
Yes and no.
Are you still at the police station?

44:58.229 --> 45:00.539
Yeah, we were... we were both...

45:00.698 --> 45:02.371
Have I died yet?

45:03.501 --> 45:05.344
Dave, can you hear me?

45:05.503 --> 45:10.248
Umm, yeah. I, uh...

45:10.408 --> 45:12.581
everyone ran out of the room.
They said you had...

45:12.743 --> 45:14.848
No no, there's no time
to explain all this right now.

45:15.012 --> 45:17.612
Look, leave the police station
right now during all the commotion.

45:17.682 --> 45:19.423
They'll have EMTs
hauling my body out,

45:19.584 --> 45:21.564
lots of people will be
standing around looking.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.759
Just walk out. Don't run.
That'll attract attention.

45:23.888 --> 45:26.198
Just calmly walk out like
your business is done there.

45:26.357 --> 45:28.769
Also, is there any way
that you can steal my body?

45:28.926 --> 45:30.564
- What?!
- No, probably not.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.105
Okay, never mind.
We'll have to work around that.

45:32.263 --> 45:34.038
Okay, have you reached
the sidewalk yet?

45:34.198 --> 45:38.112
No, I'm still standing
in the room. I can't leave.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.651
There's still a guy in here with me.
Another cop.

45:43.808 --> 45:45.913
No, there's not.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.647
Check the mirror.

45:53.217 --> 45:54.753
I don't get it.

45:55.820 --> 45:57.163
He's not real, Dave.

45:57.321 --> 45:59.824
Well, not in the traditional sense.

46:00.992 --> 46:03.233
Just go.
Just walk out.

46:03.394 --> 46:06.307
Okay, you're gonna start seeing
things like this from time to time.

46:06.464 --> 46:08.444
It's important
that you not freak out.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.170
So, uh...

46:11.335 --> 46:12.814
he can't hurt me, right?

46:12.970 --> 46:15.348
Oh, I'm pretty sure he can.

46:38.663 --> 46:41.542
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

47:25.309 --> 47:27.653
Dave, it's me.
Where are you right now?

47:27.812 --> 47:30.986
I'm on the sidewalk outside
the cop shop, walking.

47:31.148 --> 47:34.152
Where are you? Heaven?

47:34.318 --> 47:37.094
When you hear a song on the radio,
where is the song?

47:37.254 --> 47:39.393
What?

47:39.557 --> 47:42.367
- Wh... what, John?
- Just keep walking.

47:42.526 --> 47:44.286
Just go toward the park.
And don't freak out.

47:44.428 --> 47:46.169
- Are you freaking out?
- I don't know.

47:48.232 --> 47:50.405
I can't believe
this phone still works.

47:50.568 --> 47:52.946
There's a hot dog guy about
maybe a half a block ahead.

47:53.104 --> 47:54.412
Do you see him?

47:56.407 --> 47:59.183
- Okay.
- Buy a bratwurst from him.

48:06.384 --> 48:07.692
One.

48:10.054 --> 48:12.625
Okay, I have the bratwurst.

48:12.790 --> 48:14.235
Put it up to your head.

48:15.860 --> 48:17.737
Gonna have
to ask you why, John.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.568
I have to show you something.

48:21.699 --> 48:23.770
Dave. Dave, can you hear me?

48:23.934 --> 48:26.244
All right, all right, I get it.

48:26.404 --> 48:29.613
Yeah, I can hear you through
some kind of psychic vibration

48:29.774 --> 48:31.814
or whatever and not the phone.
Okay, I get it. Okay?

48:31.976 --> 48:34.657
- Could've just told me that.
- The only reason that you can hear me

48:34.779 --> 48:36.383
is because you have
some of the Soy Sauce

48:36.547 --> 48:37.827
in your system from the syringe.

48:37.948 --> 48:40.258
But it's not very much
and it's not gonna last very long.

48:40.418 --> 48:42.489
What is that stuff, John?

48:42.653 --> 48:45.725
The Sauce... it was alive.

48:45.890 --> 48:47.233
- I swear.
- Listen,

48:47.391 --> 48:49.393
you've got to get over
to Robert's place.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.471
There aren't any cops there right now,
but there will he.

48:51.629 --> 48:53.233
We've got sort of
a narrow window here,

48:53.397 --> 48:55.502
so you've got to take a cab to Willy's,

48:55.666 --> 48:57.771
get your car and then go
to Wayside Village on Lathrop Avenue.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.848
- It's a trailer park south of town.
- I don't have any cash.

49:01.005 --> 49:03.576
I had $5. I just spent three of it
on the bratwurst.

49:03.741 --> 49:06.347
That bratwurst cost $3?
Holy crap.

49:06.510 --> 49:08.854
Okay. All right,
give me a second.

49:09.013 --> 49:11.015
Okay, check between
the sausage and the bun.

49:11.182 --> 49:13.492
You should find a $100 bill
rolled up in there.

49:16.487 --> 49:18.763
There's no money in the bratwurst.

49:18.923 --> 49:20.800
It's just a piece of lettuce.

49:20.958 --> 49:24.701
Okay. You have your ATM card?

49:38.175 --> 49:40.883
- John.
- Dave!

49:41.045 --> 49:42.683
- Yeah.
- What?

49:42.847 --> 49:44.793
Did you just drive under
a bridge or something?

49:44.949 --> 49:48.021
No, I'm at the trailer park.
Which one's Robert's?

49:48.185 --> 49:50.563
Oh, it's wearing off.
Okay, don't talk, just listen.

49:50.721 --> 49:52.223
Go inside...

49:52.389 --> 49:55.029
And as long as you
absolutely remember not to do that

49:55.192 --> 49:56.753
- you'll be fine. Good luck.

49:56.794 --> 49:58.865
Oh, wait wait wait, John.
John, I didn't get the...

49:59.029 --> 50:00.667
hello?

50:03.501 --> 50:06.641
This looks like the place.

50:13.043 --> 50:15.023
- Stay in the car.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.578
Oh shit.

52:08.258 --> 52:10.295
You know what's in there, right?

52:10.461 --> 52:12.372
We know Robert had
a stash of the shit.

52:12.529 --> 52:15.203
Hey, man!
You owe me a beer, man!

52:15.366 --> 52:18.108
And if he had a stash,
he couldn't just cram it under his bed.

52:18.268 --> 52:21.545
That black shit moves,
it has a will, an attitude.

52:21.705 --> 52:25.653
It bites. And then I realized all
at once what I had come here for.

52:25.809 --> 52:28.346
When I was on the stuff...
that little hit in my thigh...

52:28.512 --> 52:31.789
I could communicate
with the dead, with John.

52:31.949 --> 52:33.485
When it wore off, I could not.

52:33.651 --> 52:36.461
My one chance to save John
lay inside this bottle.

52:36.620 --> 52:38.964
It was decided then,
just like that.

52:39.123 --> 52:41.569
. Ugh.

52:54.371 --> 52:56.749
Oh, son of a motherfuck!

52:56.907 --> 53:00.047
The fucking Soy Sauce is digging
a fucking hole in my fucking face!

53:00.210 --> 53:03.316
I'll throw myself at the cop and beg him
to take me to the emergency room

53:03.480 --> 53:05.756
to pump my stomach,
to bring in an exorcist,

53:05.916 --> 53:08.760
to call in the Air Force to nuke
this whole town into radioactive dust

53:08.919 --> 53:10.899
and bury it under 60' of concrete!

53:11.055 --> 53:14.901
And then... calm. Almost zen.

53:15.059 --> 53:18.097
That's what came next,
that Soy Sauce feeling.

53:19.730 --> 53:23.109
I wanted to run,
to duck, to act,

53:23.267 --> 53:25.213
but the body is
a slow, wet mechanism

53:25.369 --> 53:28.612
of muscle and bone that creeped
even as my mind flew.

53:28.772 --> 53:31.412
And so just like that,
I stepped outside of it.

53:32.443 --> 53:36.289
I had a full 1.78 seconds before the
detective would step through the door.

53:36.447 --> 53:39.894
A supercomputer can do over a trillion
mathematical equations in one second.

53:40.050 --> 53:42.030
To that machine,
one second is an eternity.

53:42.186 --> 53:45.133
Okay, think.
You're standing on the thin cool crust

53:45.289 --> 53:48.634
of a gigantic ball of molten rock
hurtling through frozen space.

53:48.792 --> 53:51.068
You're in a situation
that could threaten the nature

53:51.228 --> 53:53.139
of said existence
on said molten ball,

53:53.297 --> 53:55.538
depending on which decision
you make. But wait.

53:55.699 --> 53:58.305
There are a shitload
of subatomic particles in the universe,

53:58.469 --> 54:01.143
each set into outward motion
at the moment of the Big Bang.

54:01.305 --> 54:04.752
Thus whether or not you move
your right arm now or nod your head

54:04.908 --> 54:07.718
or choose to eat Fruity Pebbles
or Corn Flakes next Thursday morning

54:07.878 --> 54:09.838
was all decided at the moment
the universe crashed

54:09.947 --> 54:12.154
into existence 17 billion years ago.

54:12.316 --> 54:15.160
Thus it is physically
impossible for you to deviate...

54:15.319 --> 54:17.595
I never finished this thought,
as I suddenly realized

54:17.755 --> 54:19.166
I was no longer in the trailer.

54:28.265 --> 54:29.642
Was I dead?

54:48.652 --> 54:50.359
Uh, excuse me.

55:04.434 --> 55:06.937
So... I...

55:07.104 --> 55:09.345
suppose you're wondering
why I'm here.

55:09.506 --> 55:11.315
Same as everybody.

55:11.475 --> 55:13.045
You're trying to figure out

55:13.210 --> 55:15.486
what in the name
of Elvis is going on.

55:15.646 --> 55:16.954
Everybody except me.

55:17.114 --> 55:19.390
Me... I don't even wanna
know anymore.

55:24.388 --> 55:25.833
I suppose you're wondering

55:25.989 --> 55:28.401
what I'm doing
with this can of gasoline?

55:32.996 --> 55:34.373
Oh, thanks.

55:34.531 --> 55:38.502
I fell... on a drill.

55:48.378 --> 55:50.688
- Oh!

55:50.848 --> 55:52.555
You leaving already?

55:55.085 --> 55:58.157
Here, help me.

55:58.322 --> 56:00.097
I'll be glad to, but first

56:00.257 --> 56:02.237
I wanna know what happened
to my friend John.

56:02.392 --> 56:03.872
Well, he's gone,
you know that, right?

56:04.027 --> 56:05.233
Meaning?

56:05.395 --> 56:07.875
He's just gone.

56:19.276 --> 56:22.917
You know a kid named
Justin White, Mr. Wong?

56:23.080 --> 56:25.890
- High school kid?
- You asked me that back at the station.

56:26.049 --> 56:30.759
I remember now. He's that kid...
kinda talks like a junior gangster.

56:30.921 --> 56:32.525
He's one of the missing, right?

56:32.689 --> 56:35.067
Well, he's the guy
who called in the...

56:35.225 --> 56:38.263
the whatever happened here...
about 4:00 in the morning.

56:41.899 --> 56:45.540
Get in! Go go go go go go!

56:52.242 --> 56:53.949
Oh!

56:58.548 --> 57:01.757
Shit.

57:01.919 --> 57:05.093
I thought he was stabbed
in the gut or something.

57:05.255 --> 57:08.134
I looked closer and there
was something on Justin...

57:08.292 --> 57:10.135
his anns and his face.

57:10.294 --> 57:13.605
- And this stuff, it's alive.

57:24.574 --> 57:28.249
Stay back, Steve.
I got this.

57:34.184 --> 57:36.323
Yo, what up, 5-0?

57:37.821 --> 57:39.960
So you're still gonna burn
this place down?

57:40.123 --> 57:41.693
That's right.

57:41.858 --> 57:43.633
And you're not gonna let me go.

57:43.794 --> 57:45.637
So you understand my mood,

57:45.796 --> 57:50.176
understand why I'm out here
committing felonies today.

57:50.334 --> 57:53.178
There are some
very dark things happening

57:54.538 --> 57:56.449
and I've got this lonely feeling

57:56.606 --> 57:58.176
like I'm the only one who knows,

57:58.342 --> 58:00.549
the only one who can
do anything about it.

58:00.711 --> 58:02.816
Everybody's got a ghost story,

58:02.980 --> 58:05.392
UFO or a Bigfoot story... no.

58:05.549 --> 58:08.189
You know what I think?
I think stuff is both

58:08.352 --> 58:11.162
real and not real at the same time.

58:12.356 --> 58:14.199
I'm not a Star Trek fan.

58:14.358 --> 58:17.635
I don't know very much about
other dimensions and all that.

58:17.794 --> 58:19.740
I'm an old school Catholic.

58:19.896 --> 58:21.569
I believe in Hell.

58:21.732 --> 58:24.076
I believe that it's more than just

58:24.234 --> 58:26.373
murderers and rapists down there.

58:26.536 --> 58:29.176
I believe in demons and worms...

58:29.339 --> 58:33.048
vile shit in the grease trap
of the universe.

58:33.210 --> 58:35.212
And the more I think about it,
the more I think

58:35.379 --> 58:37.381
that it's not just
someplace down there.

58:37.547 --> 58:39.322
Oh no, that it's right here with us.

58:39.483 --> 58:41.156
We just can't perceive it.

58:41.318 --> 58:44.094
It's kinda like
the country music radio station.

58:44.254 --> 58:46.928
It's out there in the air

58:47.090 --> 58:50.037
even if you don't tune into it.

58:50.193 --> 58:52.571
And I think that somehow
through chemistry

58:52.729 --> 58:55.335
or magic or voodoo...

58:55.499 --> 58:57.445
that Jamaican son of a bitch,

58:57.601 --> 58:59.547
he tuned in to it,

58:59.703 --> 59:01.444
into hell itself.

59:01.605 --> 59:03.448
Through that, he opened a door.

59:03.607 --> 59:05.917
He became the door.

59:06.076 --> 59:07.248
And me?

59:09.112 --> 59:10.750
I intend to close it.

59:16.753 --> 59:19.256
Uh, excuse me.

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:36.439
- Move.

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:50.815
Oh! David!

01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:55.060
You understand me? This is John.

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:59.324
Uh... hello.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:02.231
- We're in big fucking trouble, Dave.
- Yeah, no shit, Fluffy.

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:04.792
Oh, you can hear me,
so I guess you took the Soy Sauce.

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:06.171
Why?
Didn't I tell you not to?

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:07.831
And what happened to your face?

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.978
Your second question
answers your first.

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:12.079
There are two people

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:14.181
still alive from last night
other than me,

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.317
Fred Chu and your girlfriend Amy.

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:18.384
Wait. You're with Amy?
And who's got you?

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:21.216
Justin White...
or that thing that used to be Justin.

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.654
Uh, that's four still alive,
including Justin.

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:26.373
There's nothing left of Justin
inside of him now. Couple of days,

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.436
Justin's gonna hatch
just like that Jamaican did.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.429
Anybody in the vicinity
when that happens

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:32.396
will become a spawning pod thing.

01:01:32.556 --> 01:01:35.059
Dave, the last world
that saw these things

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:37.933
was saturated within 100 days.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:40.700
And don't ask me how I know that either,
because I don't know.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.708
Okay, I got another question.
Everyone who took the Soy Sauce

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:47.371
is either dead or comatose
except for me.

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:50.298
Probably able to adjust.
But you should have figured out by now,

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:52.114
you don't choose the Soy Sauce.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.186
The Soy Sauce chooses you.

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:56.051
The Soy Sauce chooses you.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.853
If it can't use you,
it kills you.

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:00.655
From what I hear,
it plays with you first.

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:32.316
Justin?

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.590
Yo, you need
to come roll with me, dude.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.760
Where, uh...
where we going, Justin?

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:45.463
Why you fronting, bro?

01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:47.165
You know what time it is.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:50.311
Stop calling me Justin
like nothing's changed, yo.

01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:52.310
What should I call you, homey?

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:53.914
Just call me Shitload,

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:57.176
because there's a shitload
of us in here, yo.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.081
Dude, I know you strapped,

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:01.415
- but before you think about...

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:03.353
...flashing that nine on me, yo,

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.459
you better listen
to what I's gots to say.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.608
As I was saying, yo...

01:03:28.672 --> 01:03:30.174
Listen to me, dude.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.013
I've... I'm listening, Shitload.

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:33.518
We taking a ride.

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:35.782
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:44.999
- Oh my God, my balls.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:47.897
Hey hey.
We heard the gunfire.

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:50.561
- Are you the one that shot him?

01:03:50.727 --> 01:03:53.640
- I saw his head.
- I was aiming for his heart

01:03:53.797 --> 01:03:56.243
- but yeah, I did get him.
- Good.

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.344
Amy?

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.879
Do you think he can be killed?

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:03.643
Look, I don't know.

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:06.151
He said something about an old mall.

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:09.222
The Mall of the Dead.
Why there?

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.849
John?

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:15.761
How long has he been like this?
Does he ever say anything?

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:18.866
He mumbles. Been like that
ever since they brought him in.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.365
Wake up!

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.400
Come on, wake up, asshole.

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:23.936
Hey.

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:27.936
Uh, I found your dog.

01:04:28.098 --> 01:04:30.772
I know. Thanks.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.710
Listen,

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.852
I'm gonna get us out of this.

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:40.248
Don't worry.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.287
John's got a plan.

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:57.702
Ooh.

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:01.033
Man! Where are we?

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:03.370
We're in some liquor truck
and we're on our way

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:05.206
to the abandoned mall
on Highway 59.

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:06.938
Did you say we're going
to the mall or coming back from it?

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:09.208
- Going!
- Yeah, that's right,

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:12.046
- 'cause Fred's still alive.
- What?!

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:14.620
Nothing nothing.
I got a headache.

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:26.993
You see that door?

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.292
I see it.

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:43.135
Yo, she'll be able to walk up
outta here if y'all cooperate.

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.370
I need her to open
the ghost door, yo.

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:48.846
But if you give me static or try
to play the motherfucking fool,

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.645
as soon as she done what
I need, I'm gonna make you...

01:06:51.808 --> 01:06:54.414
- Hey!

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.444
Yo, what's out there?
A weapon?

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:28.088
You trying to gank me, fool?

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:32.750
I guess there's
no getting rid of you.

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.116
Any more of them?

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:41.093
No, I don't think so.

01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:46.866
Then come on... all of you.

01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:49.334
Let's get to my car.

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:53.600
Okay, so those white things
that you saw take over Justin...

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:55.265
they're looking
for hosts, okay?

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.206
Now, uh, there was
a drug that the guy,

01:08:57.367 --> 01:08:59.471
the one who exploded,
he had it in his trailer...

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.046
That stuff is black, right?

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.877
Oh. You're, uh...
you're familiar with it?

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.452
Sounds like you and I both got
long stories to tell.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:09.385
I've been up 48 hours straight
and this case

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.345
- ain't getting no clearer.

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:16.126
It's the adrenaline...
it keeps me going.

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:17.889
Yeah.

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:20.330
That and those...

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:23.859
piercing voices in my head.

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:26.131
Wait.
What kind of voices?

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:27.706
Uh...

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:37.977
- Oh fuck!

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.522
- Ah, come on!
- Oh! Oh!

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:59.499
- Get out of the way. Oh!

01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:02.370
Dave, let's go, come on.
Get outta there!

01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:10.745
Take my hand!
Come on!

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:13.684
Go! Go! Move!

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:21.387
Shit!

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.705
Come on, let's go.

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:48.414
- Guys, I'm all right. I'm okay!

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.990
- Whoa!
That's not Fred.

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:54.151
- Not anymore.

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:57.161
Guys, look, I don't know what
you think you saw back there.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.800
Any one of us could
be infected or whatever,

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:01.492
but we gotta stick together.

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:04.570
We're the good guys here. Right?

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:07.936
Fred, why don't you go down
to the highway and flag down a car?

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.099
Yes.

01:11:14.337 --> 01:11:15.975
- Oh.

01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:18.016
Help me get him to the wreck!

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:20.176
These things are starting
to come out of him!

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:22.482
- Come on! Drag him!
- Oh God, I can't.

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:24.989
You can do it! Come on!

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:27.321
Get him over here.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:31.454
- Get back! Okay.

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:54.552
John, what are you doing?

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:57.691
My weapons.
I'm not gonna stand by

01:11:57.847 --> 01:11:59.567
while some white fuzz
from another dimension

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.089
invades our world and infects
every last man, woman and child.

01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:04.698
We're gonna go through that
ghost door and clean house.

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:07.027
What?

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:12.527
I went with the Old Testament.

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.341
Okay.

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:16.977
Why?

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:19.670
'Cause we're the only ones who can.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:22.817
'Cause we were chosen...
by the Soy Sauce.

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:25.043
- Are you in?

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:26.915
Yeah, I guess.

01:12:28.244 --> 01:12:29.814
Is that a paintball gun?

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:43.496
Ghost door... you see it?

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.502
Yeah.

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:48.198
- All I see is a wall.

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:58.776
Oh, cool.

01:13:06.249 --> 01:13:09.389
Shit.
It's a ghost knob.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.672
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Nuh-uh.

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:14.859
'Cause Justin... or Shitload
or whatever his name was...

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:17.061
he said he needed Amy to open it.

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:03.776
Hey! Amy!

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:33.107
Oh, I have so many questions to ask

01:14:33.269 --> 01:14:36.011
- but no time to ask them.
- That's him, that's the guy...

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:38.049
the one in my truck
with the slug last night.

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:40.483
Okay, Slug Man,

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.850
can you tell us
just what the fuck this place is?

01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:45.458
Well, what do you think
you're looking at there?

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:47.890
You're gonna be looking at my fist
and then Dave's dick

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.893
if you don't fucking
tell us what this is!

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:53.659
The others have devoted more time
and resources than you can imagine

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.497
to developing an ability
to pass from one side

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:58.366
to the next with no success.

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:01.531
But now we realize that you,

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:04.473
- and John here, apparently can.
- Who's "we"?

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:08.171
Oh, I have enlisted
an ally from your world.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:11.250
This guy?
You trusted this guy?

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:14.320
He's just an infomercial dude.

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:16.013
Hey, don't be so hasty, Dave.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:18.215
Dr. Marconi brings a lot to the table.

01:15:18.381 --> 01:15:20.486
Thank you, John.
You're a gentleman.

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.289
The source
of the current manifestation is

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:23.739
on the other side of this portal.

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:26.993
The entity's name is Korrok.

01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:30.501
And what does this
Korrok look like, exactly?

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.570
You will know him
when you see him. Believe me.

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.708
- He cannot be destroyed

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:38.505
by conventional means,
but I have a plan. Ladies.

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:44.448
It is called the Tripper.

01:15:44.607 --> 01:15:46.678
And it came from where, exactly?

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:48.685
This is an experimental
Cold War weapon

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:51.347
designed to take down
a city the size of Moscow.

01:15:51.514 --> 01:15:54.723
Contained within this detonator is
a block of C-4 explosive,

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:58.024
surrounded by a highly-potent
military-grade hallucinogen.

01:15:58.187 --> 01:15:59.530
If you get the opportunity,

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.759
- you may detonate it like this.

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:05.770
Now the Tripper may not kill Korrok,

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.771
but it will sure fuck his shit up.

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:11.643
Severely.

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:14.711
Well, I like the concept, Doctor.

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:17.077
Ahl Mmm. Mmm.

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:19.048
Fine.

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:20.983
How do we get in?

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:24.920
Just decide that
you want to and you will.

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:55.016
Ah.

01:16:56.846 --> 01:16:59.827
We must be in an alternate universe
of some kind.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.872
Apparently it's
"Eyes Wide Shut" world.

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:24.376
Gentlemen, welcome!

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:27.354
As you can see,

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:29.717
a select few interested parties

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:34.021
were allowed to come
and observe your arrival.

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:38.025
So we thought
removing the garments

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:40.224
would lessen your discomfort.

01:17:40.389 --> 01:17:42.232
Yes. A very nice touch.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:45.463
Good! Come.

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:53.177
Gentlemen, welcome!

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:56.745
I think they were expecting us.

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:01.885
I like the little touches though.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.690
- I suppose you are wondering

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.921
- where you are.
- I'm gonna guess

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.894
we're in an alternate universe
of some kind.

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:14.056
Well, that is correct.

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:17.864
Tell me... what was it like
passing through?

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.405
I wasn't really paying attention.

01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:22.702
Yeah, it really wasn't that great.

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:25.846
We have been awaiting
your coming.

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:28.345
We have worked very hard
for many years,

01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:30.848
suffered many
tragic setbacks in an attempt

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:33.782
to find and communicate
with your world.

01:18:33.943 --> 01:18:37.254
Your world, you see,
is a twin to our own,

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:40.860
dual offspring
born of the same litter.

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:43.360
Watch!
Up until this point,

01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:45.795
our histories were identical.

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:49.129
There was a man named
Cyrus Rooney from Tennessee.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:52.272
In your world,
he died at the age of 17,

01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:57.537
gored to death while trying to
crossbreed a bull with a Clydesdale.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.237
In our world, the man survived.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.973
Here, Cyrus Rooney was a genius.

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:07.484
He continued to experiment
in what he called beastiology.

01:19:07.643 --> 01:19:11.284
Yes. People from our South
are into that as well.

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:13.825
- You see, by 1881

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:16.725
his group had
insectile flying machines.

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:21.561
In 1902 he created
the first primitive thinking machine

01:19:21.724 --> 01:19:23.829
out of the brain of a pig.

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:32.477
You see, by your year 1922

01:19:32.635 --> 01:19:34.308
we already had self-feeding,

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:37.576
self-healing,
self-modifying computers.

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:41.517
In 1926
Mr. Rooney passed away.

01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:43.850
And then something
miraculous happened

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:46.789
to the greatest of his creations.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:50.123
The very day Mr. Rooney passed,
it became sentient.

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:52.425
It gave a name unto itself

01:19:52.588 --> 01:19:54.932
and expressed desires and emotions.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:57.593
And from that day forward,
this astonishing creature

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.103
carried on Rooney's work

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.332
and conformed all living nature

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:04.376
to urge on the advancement
of mankind.

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:06.638
For some,
this process was easy.

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:08.975
Others required re-education.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:10.708
Watch!

01:20:10.873 --> 01:20:12.546
Mama.

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:14.710
Ow! Ow!

01:20:14.877 --> 01:20:17.790
No! Please! No! Oh! Oh!

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:20.358
Oh my God!

01:20:30.626 --> 01:20:33.300
To process the magnanimity
that is Korrok

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:35.533
for your simpler minds,

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:38.372
we have translated
the following images

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:40.480
into a format that we think

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:42.638
that you will find more familiar.

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:46.082
I believe in your world
they're called cartoons.

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:51.751
Mama.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.703
Mama.

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.100
Mama!

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:18.780
There are
always those who resist progress.

01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:21.717
In our world
it is considered a crime.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:25.882
On our world it's considered
a greater crime

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:30.292
to unleash killer spiders
on an unarmed crowd.

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:33.023
We call that arachnicide.

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:35.259
But what if you had
a thinking machine?

01:21:35.424 --> 01:21:37.028
An entity so powerful

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:39.798
that it could foresee
the outcome of any action?

01:21:39.962 --> 01:21:41.566
Follow me.

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:47.445
We are all very excited

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:49.276
that you could join us.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:59.388
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:21:59.548 --> 01:22:01.721
That if Franz Kafka was here,

01:22:01.884 --> 01:22:04.831
- his head would explode?
- Actually, yeah.

01:22:04.987 --> 01:22:07.228
Gentlemen, you are
about to see something

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:10.632
very few others
have seen before you...

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.001
the ultimate manifestation

01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:16.165
of Cyrus Rooney's creation.

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:21.673
Dave, John,

01:22:21.837 --> 01:22:23.646
meet Korrok.

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:38.398
I am Korrok.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:41.867
Welcome.

01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:44.937
- Your wiener is even smaller in person.
- What?

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:47.505
With a tiny change
in your brain chemistry,

01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:50.667
- I could make you a child molester.

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:53.336
- What do you want?
- Not big black cocks,

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:55.209
so we don't have that in common.

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:57.111
Get the fuck out of my head!

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:02.551
David Wong,
son of an insane prostitute

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:05.214
and a mentally-challenged
Amway salesman.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.291
There are worlds upon worlds,

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:09.409
- an infinity you cannot grasp.
- ...in our world.

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:13.124
They will soon be
in your world too.

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:16.132
20 years ago
Korrok foretold your coming.

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:18.237
He showed us the way
to your world.

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:21.397
We have never traveled
from our plane to yours.

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:24.339
But we have tried.
Oh, we have tried.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.844
Dave, John,

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:30.313
your arrival here is a new dawn.

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:34.215
You can show us the way to go
from our world to your own.

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:36.151
You see, in our world,

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:39.155
when someone is born
with special wisdom,

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:41.225
he shares it with Korrok

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:43.886
so that Korrok could be greater.

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:45.156
Watch.

01:23:46.922 --> 01:23:49.869
Ah! Ah!

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:54.068
Mmm, bacon!

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:58.575
Understand,
we only have the best intentions.

01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:01.578
We have observed you
and will soon move

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:04.047
into your world
with astonishing speed,

01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:07.779
so that you too can know
the beneficence that is Korrok.

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.695
But first

01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:18.957
we have to share
your knowledge with Korrok.

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.408
- Dave!

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.931
- John!

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.477
No!

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:33.500
- Door!

01:25:40.369 --> 01:25:42.349
Aw, man.
You fucked up

01:25:42.504 --> 01:25:44.504
- the detonation sequence!
- Dave, John.

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:48.954
All of the human minds
who have ever lived in history,

01:25:49.111 --> 01:25:51.113
all of your thinkers and writers

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.281
and teachers and philosophers

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:55.155
could not equal even one node

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.661
of Korrok's neural web.

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.662
Our legions are ready
for the call.

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.324
- And soon all of your turmoil...

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:05.495
...and unrest and confusion

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:09.507
will vanish under
the soft hand of Korrok.

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.702
- Hmm?

01:26:11.867 --> 01:26:14.814
- Hmm?

01:26:25.147 --> 01:26:28.026
Did Bark Lee-just sacrifice his life?

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:30.094
Damn.
That dog just saved the universe.

01:26:30.252 --> 01:26:31.925
Amy's gonna kill me.

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:34.325
We must hurry.

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:41.874
Move. Now!

01:26:45.267 --> 01:26:48.248
Wait. If you could
cross over here so easily,

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:50.849
why didn't you just deliver
the freaking bomb? Why us?

01:26:51.006 --> 01:26:53.782
We needed to send someone
they would consider totally innocuous...

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:56.218
completely unable to pose
a serious threat.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:58.949
Besides, the dog needed an escort.

01:26:59.114 --> 01:27:01.560
Yes. Good thinking.

01:27:03.085 --> 01:27:05.122
So Marconi saved the day.

01:27:05.287 --> 01:27:07.198
Huh.

01:27:07.355 --> 01:27:09.357
- Korrok still exists?
- From our world,

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:11.197
it's hard to really know for sure.

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:13.202
But it's no secret that there's

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:15.363
still strange stuff
going down in this town.

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.908
What about the girl, Amy?
What happened to her?

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.205
Amy wasn't too happy
about her dog.

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:23.076
The Soy Sauce that
the dog ingested when he bit

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:26.151
the Jamaican guy allowed Bark Lee
to psychically connect

01:27:26.308 --> 01:27:27.412
with North and Marconi.

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.954
So the dog knew
what had to be done

01:27:30.112 --> 01:27:33.252
and was willing to make
the ultimate sacrifice.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:35.660
As to Amy...

01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:38.263
she's been my girlfriend
ever since.

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:48.506
I got her out of town though.

01:27:48.663 --> 01:27:50.006
She's upstate at college.

01:27:50.165 --> 01:27:52.441
Got a 3.7 GPA.

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:54.239
Good for her.
And John?

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:57.440
What, uh... what happened to him?
He survived too?

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:59.279
We shoot hoops a lot...

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:02.684
whenever we're not
too busy with, uh, work.

01:28:06.181 --> 01:28:08.092
What the hell, Mr. Wong.

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:10.196
Say we just go public with it,

01:28:10.352 --> 01:28:12.127
with your story...

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:14.995
But just telling our story,
that's not going to do shit.

01:28:15.157 --> 01:28:17.194
The testimony of two nutjobs...

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:19.965
that's just going to get us lumped in
with all the Roswell losers.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:22.267
Ah, I see. Okay.

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.137
So what do you wanna do?

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:25.869
We show them this...

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:27.980
a physical piece of evidence.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:31.015
I'm thinking if you can get this
in the hands of someone,

01:28:31.173 --> 01:28:32.675
like a...
like a lab or something.

01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:34.479
Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:37.317
Someone with
an electron microscope.

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:39.322
Right?
'Cause I'm thinking

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:42.621
whoever takes the first close look
at your Soy Sauce

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:44.320
is gonna have
a brown stain down

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:46.659
the bottom of his lab coat
a second later.

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:48.995
Yes!
Make that the story.

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.000
Hell, let 'em see
the effects themselves.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.799
Just feed that shit to a lab rat
and watch the fun begin...

01:28:53.962 --> 01:28:57.671
watch that thing start levitating
and speaking French!

01:28:57.833 --> 01:28:59.403
And you're...
you're willing to risk everything?

01:28:59.568 --> 01:29:00.876
Your life, your family?

01:29:01.036 --> 01:29:02.572
Because, I mean,
best-case scenario,

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.478
your career as a journalist
is gonna be over

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:06.550
because this is all anyone's
ever gonna remember you for.

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:09.484
And don't forget that there
may be people out there...

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:12.352
real people...
who don't want this out.

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:15.154
Oh shit.
Come on, Wong.

01:29:15.317 --> 01:29:18.491
I've been around.
Wong, I've been around.

01:29:18.653 --> 01:29:21.156
My first year out
of journalism school,

01:29:21.323 --> 01:29:23.360
I got knocked cold
covering Devil's Night

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:26.768
for the "Detroit Tribune."
That was 1984.

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:29.408
I woke up with my camera
busted on the pavement,

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:31.373
blood running down my shirt,

01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:33.376
a big fat cop standing over me

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:35.276
and he says,
"Stay down, nigger."

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:39.178
So I think I knew then
what I was doing this job for,

01:29:39.341 --> 01:29:40.911
and in the years since...

01:29:41.076 --> 01:29:42.248
what?

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.124
What, Wong?

01:29:46.281 --> 01:29:48.420
They, uh..

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:51.189
They called you the N-word?

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:55.060
Why on earth would they do that?

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.533
What? Is that some kind of joke?

01:30:01.463 --> 01:30:03.272
Why are you laughing?

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:10.546
- Oh my God.
- Hey! Hey!

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:12.912
Hey, asshole, answer me!

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:14.382
- Ow.
- What?!

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:16.579
I should have known.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:19.453
Describe yourself to me, Arnie...
physically.

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:23.585
- Tell me what you look like.
- Oh, no no no no no no no.

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:26.062
You're fucking with me.

01:30:26.221 --> 01:30:28.428
'Cause to me you're not black, Arnie.

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:32.298
To me you're a sloppy white guy

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:35.100
in a rumpled corduroy jacket
with a tape recorder.

01:30:56.151 --> 01:30:58.324
You think there's
something in there, Arnie?

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:00.956
Come on, Arnie.

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:02.294
- Open it.

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:04.937
The sooner you do,
the sooner we can move on.

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:16.612
I'm sorry, Arnie.
I really am.

01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:18.512
You did this to me.

01:31:20.008 --> 01:31:21.282
You did this to me.

01:31:21.443 --> 01:31:24.151
You killed me,
you son of a bitch!

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:27.452
- Look at your body, Arnie.

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:29.561
The one in the trunk, I mean.

01:31:31.453 --> 01:31:34.195
You've been dead for days.
I think someone got wind

01:31:34.356 --> 01:31:36.700
that you had contacted me
and they took you out.

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:39.065
I'm really sorry about that.

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:41.173
I'm not a fucking ghost.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:44.037
This is bullshit.
This is bullshit.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.579
This is my fault, Arnie.

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.378
Not just you getting killed and all,

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:55.214
but... but this...

01:31:55.377 --> 01:31:58.017
this half-life ya got.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:01.217
I did this.
I projected you.

01:32:01.383 --> 01:32:04.159
It's the Soy Sauce.
It's the one thing it lets me do.

01:32:04.319 --> 01:32:07.266
I'm thinking you got killed
right after we talked on the phone.

01:32:07.422 --> 01:32:09.382
You know how when you talk
to someone on the phone

01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:13.439
you sort of imagine what
they look like based on their voice?

01:32:13.595 --> 01:32:16.735
Well, when you got killed,

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:19.276
you immediately assumed
the shape of what I...

01:32:19.434 --> 01:32:22.074
This can't be.
It can't.

01:32:22.237 --> 01:32:23.614
I don't accept it.

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:26.879
I got kids.

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:29.522
I got a vacation coming up in June.

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:31.554
I'm going to Atlantic City.

01:32:33.181 --> 01:32:34.888
I got tickets.

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:38.690
You're in the denial stage right now.

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.093
This is all normal.

01:32:41.423 --> 01:32:45.269
Shut the fuck up, Wong! Now!

01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:50.103
I refuse to believe

01:32:50.265 --> 01:32:52.871
that I am only here because
I popped outta your imagina...

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.647
I'm sorry, Arnie.

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.287
I really am.

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:11.462
Ha! Ring it up!

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:13.621
- 274 to 137!

01:33:13.788 --> 01:33:14.988
- Ah.
- If you weren't counting

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:17.001
every basket as 137 points,

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:18.762
then you'd be up two to one.

01:33:20.829 --> 01:33:22.604
Was that there before?

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:25.976
I kinda see into it.

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:29.308
- Yeah.
I can see people.

01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:31.451
It's a hole
to another dimension, I bet.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:33.643
- Wanna go through?
- Not really.

01:33:33.808 --> 01:33:36.084
Mmm. After this point.

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.853
You just tossed our ball
into another universe.

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:42.460
Yeah. My bad.
So do I have to go get it?

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:43.823
No. This is a man's job.

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:48.024
- Whoa!

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:53.595
- Oh God. Here we go.

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:05.011
Hey, Dave.

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:07.515
Where you been, man?

01:34:07.675 --> 01:34:09.712
I've been walking around
for like two hours.

01:34:11.146 --> 01:34:12.682
Time must move different here.

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:14.349
I came right after you.

01:34:14.516 --> 01:34:16.223
At least it's cooler here.

01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:31.511
You!

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.236
Unstained!

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.903
How?!

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:14.416
I am Sergeant Vance McElroy
of the Human Liberation Army.

01:35:14.576 --> 01:35:17.921
Prophecy has foretold the coming
of strangers from another world.

01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:20.081
It is an honor to meet you.

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:23.522
I must confess I do not know
from where you came,

01:35:23.685 --> 01:35:25.187
but I can tell by looking at you

01:35:25.353 --> 01:35:27.890
that you have not been infected
with the great disease.

01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:30.036
I assume we share a common enemy.

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:33.536
If you cannot defeat him,
then all hope for mankind will be lost.

01:35:33.695 --> 01:35:36.699
Gentlemen, the winds of destiny
have blown us together.

01:35:36.864 --> 01:35:40.607
A bright dawn is about to mark
this lost and broken world.

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:43.715
- Tyranny will forever be overcome...
- Yeah yeah yeah.

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:45.873
That's very interesting,

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.917
but to perform this task

01:35:48.076 --> 01:35:50.716
we'll need a number
of items from our world.

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:53.119
So you must let us return there

01:35:53.281 --> 01:35:56.990
and come back to begin our quest.

01:35:57.151 --> 01:36:00.257
It is good then.
We shall await your return.

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:03.129
But as you depart, know that
we of the HLA resistance

01:36:03.291 --> 01:36:05.498
will always and forever be in your debt,

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:08.436
for both of you mark
all that is good and promising.

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.166
And the fact that all good...
