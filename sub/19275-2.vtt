00:00.100 --> 00:02.135
<i>Previously on "Imposters"...</i>

00:02.170 --> 00:04.037
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Mazel tov!</i>

00:04.072 --> 00:05.505
Yeah, I think we've been robbed.

00:05.540 --> 00:07.440
My wife's car is here, but she's...

00:07.475 --> 00:09.475
I'm worried she's been kidnapped or...

00:12.302 --> 00:13.279
<i>Hi, Ez.</i>

00:13.315 --> 00:16.883
<i>Credit cards,
the checking account, cash.</i>

00:16.918 --> 00:17.929
<i>It's a shock.</i>

00:17.929 --> 00:21.020
<i>You will replay every
moment we shared together,</i>

00:21.056 --> 00:23.690
<i>think about every person
we met along the way.</i>

00:25.514 --> 00:26.292
Who the hell are you?

00:26.328 --> 00:27.660
Federal Burro of Investigation.

00:27.696 --> 00:29.162
Did you say "burro"?

00:29.197 --> 00:30.463
Who are you?

00:30.498 --> 00:32.198
I am her husband... just like you.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.167
We married the same woman,
and she took us both.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.035
She's out there,
probably working some new guy,

00:36.071 --> 00:37.637
looking like some new chick.

00:37.672 --> 00:39.539
I'm supposed to fall
in love with this guy?

00:39.574 --> 00:42.742
Gary Heller... managing director
of the Pacific Bank and Trust.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.344
<i>I bet his bark is worse than his bite.</i>

00:44.379 --> 00:45.845
That's what the last two girls said.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.847
What do you know about
facial-recognition software?

00:47.882 --> 00:50.416
- So the initial fee is...
- 1,000 American dollars.

00:50.452 --> 00:52.218
<i>You will never find me.</i>

00:56.904 --> 00:59.071
Mr. Heller?

00:59.107 --> 01:01.907
Hi. I'm Saffron Keyes.

01:06.314 --> 01:10.483
Every few years,
I like to try new places, new faces.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074

01:24.499 --> 01:27.933
Hi. I'm Saffron Keyes.

01:30.138 --> 01:31.771
Showtime.

01:32.537 --> 01:34.235
He's ready to see you now.

01:41.916 --> 01:43.682
Mr. Heller?

01:43.718 --> 01:45.618
Hi.

01:45.653 --> 01:48.287
I'm Ms. Keyes. You can call me Saffron.

01:48.322 --> 01:51.357
Yes, Ms. Keyes... Saffron.

01:51.392 --> 01:55.628
- Please come in. Take a seat.
- Thank you.

01:55.663 --> 01:57.663
As you know,
I'm looking for a new assistant.

01:57.698 --> 01:59.932
- My job is a very big one.
- Assistant?

01:59.967 --> 02:02.435
I thought I was here to
sell you Girl Scout cookies.

02:02.470 --> 02:06.972
Would you like to try one?
They're very delicious.

02:07.008 --> 02:10.342
You're being funny. You're funny.

02:10.377 --> 02:12.511
- That's good.
- Good. I'm glad I can be funny.

02:12.547 --> 02:15.014
I usually get "adorable"
or "cute" or "hot."

02:15.049 --> 02:16.515
Blech.

02:16.551 --> 02:18.717
Yes, well... Let's see.

02:18.753 --> 02:21.153
Uh, Philadelphia Savings Bank,
Montclair Insurance.

02:21.189 --> 02:22.621
These are all excellent references.

02:22.657 --> 02:24.290
What brings you to Seattle?

02:24.325 --> 02:26.959
Well, I guess you can call
me somewhat of a free spirit.

02:26.994 --> 02:30.029
Every few years,
I like to try new places, new faces.

02:30.064 --> 02:31.730
- A free spirit in banking.
- Mm-hmm.

02:31.766 --> 02:33.532
I'm not sure that that's a thing.

02:33.568 --> 02:35.401
Oh, don't get me wrong.

02:35.436 --> 02:37.006
I can be quite serious.

02:38.981 --> 02:40.139
Funny again.

02:40.174 --> 02:41.340
Thanks again.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.976
Boy, if you keep
flattering me like this,

02:44.011 --> 02:46.412
who knows what will happen in here?

02:49.083 --> 02:50.863
- Excuse me?
- Uh...

02:51.552 --> 02:53.152
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
- I was just joking.

02:53.187 --> 02:54.753
Do you think you can just waltz in here,

02:54.789 --> 02:56.188
bat your eyelashes, and get this job?

02:56.224 --> 02:57.990
- No.
- Do you think I've never f... ed

02:58.025 --> 02:59.992
a pretty girl in my life before?

03:00.027 --> 03:02.695
- Mr. Heller, I didn't mean...
- You can leave now.

03:06.067 --> 03:08.134
Now!

03:16.043 --> 03:18.177
Someone must've really
done a number on you.

03:18.212 --> 03:19.945
What did you just say to me?

03:22.617 --> 03:23.682
I said...

03:23.718 --> 03:25.784
whoever broke your heart

03:25.820 --> 03:27.553
must've really done a number on you.

03:27.588 --> 03:28.954
You don't know a damn thing about me.

03:28.990 --> 03:30.256
I know what hurt looks like.

03:30.291 --> 03:31.790
I see it all over you,

03:31.826 --> 03:33.792
and I know how it can harden a person.

03:33.828 --> 03:37.029
But you see, I made a choice
to not let it get to me.

03:37.064 --> 03:40.432
And you, mister, well,
you or some people...

03:40.468 --> 03:43.802
they let it make them mistrustful...

03:43.838 --> 03:46.438
I mean "mistrustable."

03:46.474 --> 03:49.942
M-mistrusting...
whatever that stupid word is.

03:49.977 --> 03:51.755
I think it's mistrusting.

03:53.414 --> 03:55.614
- Don't you laugh at me.
- I'm not. I'm not.

03:55.650 --> 03:57.783
I swear, Ms. Keyes, I'm not.

03:57.818 --> 04:01.620
I suppose I just... "mistrustabled" you.

04:01.656 --> 04:03.455
Right?

04:06.093 --> 04:09.428
Look, I may have overreacted,

04:09.463 --> 04:13.065
and for that, I apologize.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.667
Apology accepted.

04:18.272 --> 04:20.839
Would you still like to be my assistant?

04:22.282 --> 04:23.275
Really?

04:24.773 --> 04:27.046
I thought I totally blew it.

04:28.816 --> 04:33.485
You were right about one thing.

04:33.521 --> 04:36.455
I am untrusting.

04:36.490 --> 04:38.490
Professional hazard, let's say.

04:38.526 --> 04:41.093
So be loyal.

04:41.128 --> 04:42.261
Yeah?

04:42.296 --> 04:43.862
Absolutely.

04:45.466 --> 04:48.133
You can count on me.

04:49.503 --> 04:52.671
15 months, 2,000 miles,

04:52.707 --> 04:54.306
and I finally found her.

04:54.342 --> 04:57.509
5 1/2 weeks and 9 miles,
and I finally found her.

04:57.545 --> 04:59.511
Yeah, I also got my life ripped apart.

04:59.547 --> 05:01.313
Oh, and by the way,
the spy shop was my idea,

05:01.349 --> 05:03.015
so I guess I really did find her.

05:03.050 --> 05:04.683
Yeah, but I found you first, bro...
you didn't find me.

05:04.719 --> 05:06.652
- I didn't know you existed.
- Exactly.

05:06.687 --> 05:08.487
First I found you,
and now I found Alice.

05:08.522 --> 05:10.689
And now I'm gonna take her
ass back to Scottsdale,

05:10.725 --> 05:12.358
and after a few special nights

05:12.393 --> 05:14.526
which remind her of this
thing I do with my pinkie,

05:14.562 --> 05:15.694
she's all yours.

05:15.730 --> 05:17.696
Nice. Very classy.

05:17.732 --> 05:21.133
What, you don't want
one more night with Ava?

05:21.168 --> 05:22.901
There is no Ava.

05:22.937 --> 05:26.038
I want to know who she really is.

05:26.073 --> 05:27.539
Oh, that's her.

05:27.575 --> 05:30.142
Thank you. This... this is great.

05:30.177 --> 05:33.345
Yeah, but it's all crossed out.

05:33.381 --> 05:35.547
Where's the intel on her 20?

05:35.583 --> 05:36.882
Her location.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.717
Oh, I have her 20, full address...

05:38.753 --> 05:41.387
Take you right to the front door...
all right here.

05:41.422 --> 05:45.057
- Can you get it for us, please?
- Relax, man.

05:45.092 --> 05:46.825
I'd love to get it for you.
You got $5,000?

05:46.861 --> 05:48.527
- What?
- What?

05:48.562 --> 05:51.930
No, no, no, we gave you
$1,000 to find her.

05:51.966 --> 05:53.365
You must be the smart one.

05:53.401 --> 05:56.235
And the pretty boy here is the muscle.

05:56.909 --> 05:58.170
$1,000 to find her,

05:58.205 --> 06:01.407
$5,000 if you want to see the intel.

06:01.442 --> 06:03.409
- You've got to be joking.
- That's bullshit, man.

06:03.444 --> 06:06.612
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

06:06.647 --> 06:08.847
I don't do jokes.
See you when you got $5,000.

06:08.883 --> 06:10.416
Hey, man, I don't think you...

06:10.451 --> 06:11.917
- Whoa!
- Hey, whoa, dude.

06:11.952 --> 06:13.585
Everyone just relax. Everything's fine.

06:13.621 --> 06:16.188
If everything in this world is fine,

06:16.223 --> 06:18.257
I'd be out of business.

06:19.994 --> 06:22.027
You see my titties?

06:22.063 --> 06:23.595
Do you see my titties?

06:23.631 --> 06:25.431
- I don't see no titties.
- No, no, no, no.

06:25.466 --> 06:27.266
That's right, bitches,
'cause I ain't your mama.

06:27.301 --> 06:31.103
Now, until you have my 5 large,
get the hell out of my store.

06:31.138 --> 06:32.404
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.006
- We'll do that.
- Okay.

06:41.816 --> 06:44.216
Just throw that down right here.

06:44.251 --> 06:45.984
Thanks for the help.

06:46.020 --> 06:48.487
You could use a little upper-body work.

06:48.522 --> 06:49.755
I made a projected inventory,

06:49.790 --> 06:52.224
price-inflation-
towards-reduction chart.

06:52.259 --> 06:53.659
According to my calculations,

06:53.694 --> 06:55.294
we should clear 7 to 10 grand,
no problem.

06:55.329 --> 06:57.429
Really? Good. That's great.

06:57.465 --> 06:59.798
Yeah. Just let me
do the selling, all right?

06:59.834 --> 07:01.767
Once I'm on a roll,
try not to get in my way.

07:01.802 --> 07:03.001
Yeah, God forbid I should keep you

07:03.037 --> 07:04.670
from getting shot in the face.

07:04.705 --> 07:06.238
Oh, did you keep me from
getting shot in the face,

07:06.273 --> 07:07.439
puppy-dog eyes?

07:07.475 --> 07:08.807
That dude's an asshole.

07:08.843 --> 07:10.275
He needs to learn a lesson.

07:10.311 --> 07:12.010
Okay, I get it. Just keep your temper.

07:12.046 --> 07:13.846
All right, last chance, man.

07:13.881 --> 07:15.013
Anything you want to save?

07:19.286 --> 07:21.820
Sell it all.

07:21.856 --> 07:23.455
Who wants to buy some goodies?

07:23.491 --> 07:24.656
You do.

07:24.692 --> 07:26.024
What's up, man?

07:26.060 --> 07:28.660
All right, let's go see this.

07:28.696 --> 07:30.662
Five bucks more,
and it's all yours, buddy.

07:30.698 --> 07:33.665
All right. Awesome.

07:33.701 --> 07:35.501
Awesome, ladies.

07:37.304 --> 07:41.039
That's a good find.

07:41.075 --> 07:42.474
Yes, ma'am.

07:42.510 --> 07:44.276
Enjoy that purse. I'll take it.

07:44.311 --> 07:46.845
Thank you very much, ladies.
That is such a beautiful dress.

07:46.881 --> 07:48.714
I think it would look great on you.

07:48.749 --> 07:51.049
You know, you can go try it on,
if you'd like, right inside.

07:51.085 --> 07:52.284
It's really nice.

07:52.319 --> 07:56.188
Do you like it?

07:56.223 --> 07:57.656
I bought you that dress.

07:57.691 --> 08:00.058
I know,<i> chéri.</i>

08:01.419 --> 08:04.096
Perhaps you want to keep this one.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.867
Little memento, no?

08:08.903 --> 08:11.970
- What do you think?
- You look incredible.

08:12.006 --> 08:13.472
You can't not buy it.

08:13.507 --> 08:14.502
I'll take it.

08:14.502 --> 08:15.422
- Good call.
- How much?

08:15.422 --> 08:17.876
Actually, that one's free. Take it.

08:17.912 --> 08:20.412
Oh, are you sure?
Let me give you something for it.

08:20.448 --> 08:21.473
Take it right now, and it's free.

08:21.473 --> 08:24.516
Otherwise you can deal with
Glengarry Glen Ross over here.

08:24.552 --> 08:27.319
Okay. Uh, well, thanks.

08:27.354 --> 08:29.922
You're welcome. Have a good one.

08:29.957 --> 08:33.325
Dude, if you let emotion
get in the way of selling...

08:33.360 --> 08:34.659
I bought Ava that dress,

08:34.695 --> 08:36.260
and I needed it gone, so let it go.

08:36.297 --> 08:37.429
- I don't care...
- Let it go.

08:37.465 --> 08:40.532
- Fine.
- How we doing?

08:41.493 --> 08:44.536
Well, with 79% of our inventory gone,

08:44.572 --> 08:46.538
we have made 12% of our projection.

08:46.574 --> 08:48.073
What the hell?

08:48.108 --> 08:49.741
Look, man, I'm used
to selling cars, all right?

08:49.777 --> 08:51.743
You overprice, reduce price, sell.
It's simple.

08:51.779 --> 08:54.213
Your weird kitchen stools
aren't exactly making it easy.

08:54.248 --> 08:55.414
Yes, of course I remember.

08:55.449 --> 08:57.182
I have it right here in my purse.

08:57.218 --> 08:58.750
Look, check out this guy.

08:58.786 --> 09:00.853
He's what we call a "beta-alpha."

09:00.888 --> 09:03.121
Thinks he's an alpha male,
and he's actually a beta male.

09:03.157 --> 09:06.058
Sounds about right. That's my brother.

09:06.093 --> 09:08.460
Hey, man. Uh, this is Richard.
He's, uh...

09:08.496 --> 09:10.028
helping me with the yard sale.

09:10.064 --> 09:12.130
- Pleasure to meet you, man.
- What's up?

09:12.166 --> 09:14.566
All right, well, back to the wars.

09:18.353 --> 09:20.105
What a shitshow, Ez.

09:20.140 --> 09:21.773
You're better than this, man...

09:21.809 --> 09:23.775
chasing after Ava or
whatever her name is.

09:23.811 --> 09:25.310
I mean, let's get you out of this funk.

09:25.346 --> 09:26.778
Don't bother. I'm gonna find her.

09:26.814 --> 09:28.080
I'm gonna straighten things out.

09:28.115 --> 09:29.748
How, by ruining your life even more?

09:29.783 --> 09:31.583
By shitting on your friends and family?

09:31.619 --> 09:33.952
Mom and Dad... they're heartbroken, man.

09:33.988 --> 09:36.822
Gaby quit. She's out.

09:36.857 --> 09:38.590
- What even happened there, man?
- It's none of your business.

09:38.626 --> 09:39.925
It absolutely is my business.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.159
And now the bank is taking your house.

09:41.195 --> 09:42.728
I didn't even ask you to come!

09:42.763 --> 09:44.963
Boys, boys! That's enough.

09:44.999 --> 09:46.865
Sweetie, can we have a talk?

09:49.603 --> 09:51.169
Oh, I thought you said "we." I get it.

09:51.205 --> 09:53.071
Okay, I'm gonna go look at some stuff.

09:53.107 --> 09:54.606
Come on.

09:54.642 --> 09:57.376
So you're really going to just go?

09:57.411 --> 09:58.405
I am.

09:58.846 --> 10:00.812
I can't understand it, but I want to.

10:00.848 --> 10:02.414
Mom, it's gonna be fine. I promise.

10:02.449 --> 10:05.183
Your dad is very upset with you.

10:05.219 --> 10:08.453
But... he wants you to have this.

10:14.495 --> 10:17.629
- I can't take that.
- Honey, don't be proud.

10:17.665 --> 10:19.998
She took all your money.
She took everything.

10:20.034 --> 10:21.600
Let us just help you through this.

10:21.635 --> 10:23.802
Mom, my whole life
I've been leaning on you.

10:23.837 --> 10:25.203
Not anymore.

10:25.239 --> 10:27.005
It's called parenting.

10:27.041 --> 10:28.840
That's what we do.

10:30.745 --> 10:31.843
Thank Dad for me, okay?

10:31.879 --> 10:34.446
Okay.

10:34.904 --> 10:36.251
Oh, my God.

10:36.714 --> 10:38.049
It's Binky.

10:39.486 --> 10:41.019
No one else should have this.

10:41.055 --> 10:43.622
Can I buy this?
It should stay in the family.

10:43.657 --> 10:45.290
Of course.

10:45.326 --> 10:47.626
Okay, good. I'll give you $5,000.

10:47.661 --> 10:49.928
Nice try.

10:54.501 --> 11:00.205
<i>♪ Did you ever really love me? ♪</i>

11:01.909 --> 11:07.012
<i>♪ Did you ever really care? ♪</i>

11:11.418 --> 11:13.852
Good morning, Mr. Heller.
Nice to see you.

11:13.887 --> 11:16.488
I start in kitchen. It's okay?

11:24.849 --> 11:27.051
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

11:29.535 --> 11:31.002
Happy first day.

11:33.172 --> 11:35.573
- Mr. Heller?
- Coffee.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.009
Milk and two sugars.

11:38.044 --> 11:39.443
Back in a jiffy.

11:39.479 --> 11:41.746
This is Andy,
the youngest member of our team.

11:41.781 --> 11:44.148
- And best-looking.
- Till now.

11:44.183 --> 11:44.966
Oh.

11:45.551 --> 11:47.251
I'm Saffron. Nice to meet you.

11:47.286 --> 11:48.652
Very nice to meet you, too.

11:48.688 --> 11:50.354
Here's Mr. Heller's mail. Good luck.

11:50.390 --> 11:51.956
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:19.976 --> 12:21.886
I don't know how the hell this happened.

12:21.921 --> 12:25.356
Mr. Heller,
I picked these up at lunch for you.

12:25.391 --> 12:26.991
I hope you don't mind.

12:29.896 --> 12:31.562
What the hell is this?

12:31.597 --> 12:33.798
That is my goddamn password.

12:33.833 --> 12:34.999
Saffron!

12:39.238 --> 12:43.207
Mr. Heller, this is Florence Hayes,
our new IT man.

12:43.242 --> 12:46.010
Did you turn it off and turn it on?

12:48.081 --> 12:49.713
Good night.

12:55.088 --> 12:56.667
- Good night.
- Good night.

12:58.424 --> 13:00.624
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, sir.

13:03.062 --> 13:05.029
Oh, whoa, whoa, hey. Hang on, hang on.

13:05.064 --> 13:07.231
- I got us. I got us.
- Wow.

13:07.266 --> 13:08.833
Good gods.

13:08.868 --> 13:12.036
Well, aren't you
my knight in shining armor?

13:12.071 --> 13:13.604
All right, carefully, this way.

13:13.639 --> 13:14.939
Come on.

13:14.974 --> 13:17.308
- So your two-week review is coming up.
- Oh, yeah?

13:17.364 --> 13:18.963
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.331
<i>The fresher the milk,</i>

13:20.367 --> 13:22.267
the more delicious the cheese will be.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.269
Obviously, it would be best
if you had your own cow.

13:24.884 --> 13:27.051
But if you're not willing to
make that sort of commitment,

13:27.086 --> 13:28.419
just buy milk and warm it up,

13:28.454 --> 13:30.788
but very slowly, on the stovetop.

13:30.823 --> 13:32.089
Now, when we come back from break,

13:32.125 --> 13:33.591
I'll go into the different coagulants.

13:33.626 --> 13:34.725
Okay, back in ten.

13:39.098 --> 13:41.599
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:41.634 --> 13:42.933
I just wanted to return your book.

13:42.969 --> 13:44.635
Thank you.

13:44.670 --> 13:46.637
Josh told me you quit, huh?

13:46.672 --> 13:50.274
I did. Yeah, I just needed to
not be surrounded by Blooms

13:50.309 --> 13:51.408
all the time.

13:51.444 --> 13:53.116
- I can relate to that.
- Yeah.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.478
And now you make cheese?

13:55.478 --> 13:57.882
No, no, it's just... it's a new hobby.

13:57.917 --> 14:01.785
Just trying to fill my
head with other thoughts.

14:03.489 --> 14:05.289
Look, Gaby,
I'm so sorry for what happened

14:05.324 --> 14:08.893
that night that I, um,
made you talk in an accent.

14:08.928 --> 14:11.162
And then told me it
wasn't up to scratch?

14:12.832 --> 14:15.099
I actually, like,
really needed a kick in "zee" butt.

14:15.134 --> 14:17.268
So thank you.

14:17.303 --> 14:20.337
It was a good wake-up call.

14:24.343 --> 14:27.478
I don't think you know this, but...

14:28.015 --> 14:30.814
I used to get into
work early every single day

14:30.850 --> 14:33.484
so I could watch you
walk down the street...

14:33.519 --> 14:36.420
sort of see you out in the world.

14:36.455 --> 14:40.424
I would imagine that I was
somebody that you didn't know,

14:40.459 --> 14:43.127
and you would accidentally bump into me,

14:43.162 --> 14:44.495
and then we would...

14:46.165 --> 14:48.199
Okay, everyone, break's over.

14:48.234 --> 14:50.367
Let's go make cheese.

14:52.738 --> 14:55.372
I should get back,
or my curds won't form properly.

14:55.408 --> 14:58.142
Yeah, don't let that happen. Sounds bad.

14:58.177 --> 14:59.643
You should keep this.

14:59.679 --> 15:01.345
I underlined passages...
not very subtle...

15:01.380 --> 15:05.282
but I actually think page
35 is more for you now.

15:05.318 --> 15:07.351
- Page 35.
- Yeah.

15:07.386 --> 15:10.387
- Got it.
- Mm.

15:10.956 --> 15:12.456
Ezra, um...

15:12.491 --> 15:15.893
$5,000, that's a bargain.

15:17.597 --> 15:19.363
Binky...
I just thought it was really nice

15:19.398 --> 15:21.565
that you let your mom buy it.

15:26.205 --> 15:28.639
Oh, well, look who's here.

15:28.674 --> 15:30.140
Where's the pretty one?

15:30.176 --> 15:33.010
I am the pretty one.

15:38.584 --> 15:40.985
- This is $5,000.
- Yes, it is.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.554
I'm pretty damn sure I said $7,500.

15:43.589 --> 15:47.391
Hmm. I'm pretty damn
sure you said $5,000...

15:47.426 --> 15:49.727
- and "ow."
- What?

15:49.762 --> 15:51.562
Ah!

15:51.597 --> 15:53.089
Yeah, I thought so.

15:54.433 --> 15:55.899
Knock, knock.

15:55.935 --> 15:57.368
Who's there?

15:57.403 --> 16:00.004
My balls, dickhead.

16:00.039 --> 16:01.805
Grab it.

16:05.611 --> 16:07.511
This is where she lives?

16:07.546 --> 16:09.013
Yeah.

16:09.048 --> 16:10.581
Pleasure doing business.

16:13.219 --> 16:15.019
Whoo! That's what I'm talking about!

16:15.054 --> 16:16.420
That is what I'm talk...

16:16.455 --> 16:18.222
What's up?

16:18.752 --> 16:20.057
Yeah, man!

16:21.727 --> 16:24.795
Oh, my God, come on.

16:24.830 --> 16:27.831
Ah, that is disgusting.

16:29.468 --> 16:31.035
- Hey.
- Just gonna ditch me?

16:31.070 --> 16:32.803
- What?
- After I found her for you?

16:32.838 --> 16:34.271
- I was just getting...
- Bullshit.

16:34.307 --> 16:36.240
And you went to my
mother behind my back?

16:36.275 --> 16:37.941
What kind of man does that?

16:37.977 --> 16:40.444
The kind of man who has his
eyes on the mother-effing prize,

16:40.479 --> 16:42.246
who isn't mooning over a red dress,

16:42.281 --> 16:43.614
'cause the way I see it, man,

16:43.649 --> 16:45.582
you either want to
find her or you don't.

16:45.618 --> 16:47.451
- Oh, I do.
- Then do whatever it takes.

16:47.486 --> 16:49.620
Oh, I will, but I will not trust you.

16:49.655 --> 16:52.389
Oh, God. I think I'm gonna cry.

16:52.425 --> 16:55.259
- Did you get the intel?
- Yeah.

16:55.294 --> 16:57.294
He wanted more money,
but I took care of it.

16:57.330 --> 17:01.498
- You got, what, gum?
- I did what I had to do.

17:01.534 --> 17:03.634
So are you ready to go find her?

17:03.669 --> 17:05.169
Yeah.

17:05.204 --> 17:06.502
Keys?

17:13.846 --> 17:16.914
You know, you could've just
opened the passenger-side door.

17:16.949 --> 17:18.882
I-I know.

17:23.321 --> 17:26.290
<i>All right, let's put some tunes on.</i>

17:28.527 --> 17:30.094
<i>You got to be kidding me.</i>

17:30.129 --> 17:31.495
<i>- Don't do that.
- What?</i>

17:31.530 --> 17:33.097
<i>Do not be the guy that does not think</i>

17:33.132 --> 17:34.665
<i>that Chris Martin has
it all figured out.</i>

17:34.700 --> 17:36.133
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

17:44.710 --> 17:46.176
How are you gonna make that?

17:46.212 --> 17:49.113
You are worrying way too much.

17:49.148 --> 17:51.115
We're all good.
I have all the logistics.

17:51.150 --> 17:52.950
I have all the data.

17:52.985 --> 17:54.485
All we have to do is head
there on Wednesday...

17:54.520 --> 17:56.520
Can I have an espresso
and a croissant, please?

17:56.555 --> 17:58.689
Yeah, do you want it to stay or to go?

17:58.724 --> 18:00.891
How about to stay?

18:01.165 --> 18:02.626
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:02.661 --> 18:04.495
Uh, that's all right.
I don't want to interrupt.

18:04.530 --> 18:07.364
You're not. I was just leaving.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.366
- So next Friday?
- Yeah.

18:11.737 --> 18:14.538
It's a business associate.

18:14.573 --> 18:16.140
I didn't ask.

18:16.175 --> 18:18.409
You didn't have to.

18:18.444 --> 18:20.711
Come on, why don't you sit
with me for a minute?

18:22.652 --> 18:24.019
Princeton... fancy.

18:24.425 --> 18:25.958
Well, full disclosure...

18:25.993 --> 18:28.761
Princeton was a scholarship
because I was good at math,

18:28.796 --> 18:32.364
and math led me to tech,
and then tech led me here.

18:32.399 --> 18:34.133
Following your dreams?

18:34.942 --> 18:37.369
More like following
the path of least resistance.

18:37.404 --> 18:39.571
I created an algorithm
for my senior thesis.

18:39.607 --> 18:43.375
A few companies out here
became interested, and...

18:43.410 --> 18:45.944
What does the algorithm do?

18:45.980 --> 18:48.147
- You really interested?
- So far.

18:48.182 --> 18:49.017
Okay.

18:49.483 --> 18:50.916
Well, let's say

18:50.951 --> 18:53.786
one day you happen to meet a tall,
good-looking guy

18:53.821 --> 18:55.954
that you think you might want to marry.

18:55.990 --> 18:57.589
For the sake of the story.

18:57.625 --> 18:58.957
Well, madame, we've just met,

18:58.993 --> 19:00.626
so this certainly isn't an offer.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.227
Well, give it a minute.

19:02.263 --> 19:03.962
- I'm kidding.
- Touché.

19:03.998 --> 19:05.430
Anyway, so you're online.

19:05.466 --> 19:08.167
You're searching for rings and venues,

19:08.202 --> 19:11.170
and my algorithm says,
"Hey, someone in here

19:11.205 --> 19:14.239
is a romantic, wedding-planning fool."

19:14.275 --> 19:16.408
And then companies start
sending you coupons

19:16.443 --> 19:18.477
for DJs and honeymoon places.

19:18.512 --> 19:20.179
It kind of helps the marketplace to...

19:20.214 --> 19:23.315
Take advantage of just how
predictable human behavior is.

19:23.350 --> 19:25.818
Well, I mean,
if you want to be cynical about it,

19:25.853 --> 19:27.252
that's a good way to put it.

19:27.288 --> 19:29.321
But I like to say I'm
helping people find...

19:29.356 --> 19:30.646
Buy more shit.

19:31.458 --> 19:33.826
Sorry. I'm sorry.
That's really impressive.

19:33.861 --> 19:36.328
So you run a tech company?

19:36.363 --> 19:38.430
I <i> did</i> run a tech company.

19:38.465 --> 19:42.167
And about six months ago,
I got some offers to sell...

19:42.203 --> 19:44.336
and here I am.

19:45.433 --> 19:47.039
Yes, here you are.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.511
You know,
I know this is out of the blue,

19:52.546 --> 19:56.014
but, um,
Saturday I'm having a barbecue...

19:56.050 --> 19:57.649
Some friends, some family coming by.

19:57.685 --> 20:00.219
Why don't you join us,
have some lunch, a few drinks?

20:00.254 --> 20:02.154
- No.
- Whoa.

20:02.189 --> 20:04.489
Sorry. It came out wrong.
I-I would love to.

20:04.525 --> 20:05.824
It's just, you know,

20:05.860 --> 20:09.228
new job and, um,
a lot on my plate right now.

20:09.263 --> 20:10.395
Okay, well, yeah, no.

20:10.431 --> 20:11.830
No pressure.

20:12.176 --> 20:14.700
But just in case...

20:14.735 --> 20:16.401
- here is my number.
- Hey.

20:16.437 --> 20:18.670
Well, good morning, Ms. Keyes.

20:18.706 --> 20:21.807
Uh, Patrick, this is, uh,
Florence, the new IT guy.

20:21.842 --> 20:23.675
The IT guy?

20:24.137 --> 20:25.698
Got to watch those IT guys.

20:25.698 --> 20:26.879
He knows where the bodies are buried.

20:26.914 --> 20:28.647
- Ha!
- Anyway...

20:28.682 --> 20:30.883
- Give me a call, just in case.
- Great.

20:30.918 --> 20:33.385
- You guys have a great day.
- Yeah.

20:35.089 --> 20:37.556
We're not even halfway there,

20:37.591 --> 20:39.691
and at the rate we're going
through gas and snacks...

20:39.727 --> 20:42.261
We need to eat every two hours
to maintain peak performance.

20:42.296 --> 20:46.698
Whatever. Look, the point is $213.12...

20:46.734 --> 20:48.500
Is definitely not gonna get us there.

20:48.535 --> 20:51.503
We need to figure out how to get more.

20:51.538 --> 20:53.605
We need to get smart.

21:02.082 --> 21:04.283
So I can't buy protein shakes,
but you can buy books?

21:04.827 --> 21:06.518
Short cons.

21:06.986 --> 21:08.287
Let's make some money
the old-fashioned way.

21:08.322 --> 21:10.088
Start reading.

21:12.893 --> 21:14.526
<i>I'll give you a dime for every quarter</i>

21:14.561 --> 21:15.727
<i>you can lay on end.</i>

21:15.763 --> 21:17.229
<i>- Sir?
- How you doing?</i>

21:17.264 --> 21:18.964
<i>Hi. Could I get a Miller, please?</i>

21:19.797 --> 21:20.799
<i>You got it.</i>

21:27.068 --> 21:27.806
<i>Ten in a row.</i>

21:30.144 --> 21:32.244
<i>"Chapter one, The Fundamentals...</i>

21:32.279 --> 21:34.112
"No short-con repertoire
would be complete

21:34.148 --> 21:35.747
"without the classic
distraction maneuver

21:35.783 --> 21:37.382
"known as the 'bait and switch.'

21:37.418 --> 21:38.750
<i>"The key is picking</i>

21:38.786 --> 21:40.652
<i>the appropriate unsuspecting target."</i>

21:40.688 --> 21:42.754
So we're really gonna do this?

21:42.790 --> 21:46.158
I mean, I want to find her, man.
I really do, but...

21:46.193 --> 21:48.427
this guy and his family?

21:48.462 --> 21:52.331
- That'll make us just as bad as...
- Ava.

21:52.366 --> 21:53.765
You know, one of those books

21:53.801 --> 21:56.134
said you can't cheat an honest man.

21:56.170 --> 21:58.136
Yeah, I read that. I still don't get it.

21:58.172 --> 21:59.638
- Hey, thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:59.673 --> 22:00.939
It's like there are people

22:00.975 --> 22:02.574
who set themselves up to be taken

22:02.609 --> 22:03.976
because they're, you know,

22:04.011 --> 22:07.346
greedy or selfish or mean.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.781
You know what?
We need some ground rules.

22:09.817 --> 22:12.351
We need, like, a code of conduct
for how far we're willing to go.

22:12.817 --> 22:15.587
Like you said, we can't just
steal from normal people, right?

22:16.042 --> 22:17.409
You know what else?

22:17.444 --> 22:20.412
Bushido, the samurai code...

22:20.447 --> 22:23.415
the true warrior must hold that loyalty,
courage, and honor

22:23.450 --> 22:25.583
are important above all else.

22:25.619 --> 22:26.718
Nice.

22:28.455 --> 22:30.054
- No old people.
- Sure.

22:30.090 --> 22:31.122
Yeah.

22:31.158 --> 22:34.025
No kids.

22:34.060 --> 22:36.594
No people who look, you know, sad.

22:36.630 --> 22:37.796
Yeah.

22:37.831 --> 22:40.031
No nice moms or dads...

22:40.066 --> 22:42.233
or anyone who's limping.

22:42.269 --> 22:43.902
No babies.

22:45.839 --> 22:47.205
What does that leave us?

22:47.327 --> 22:49.073
Hey, lady...

22:49.109 --> 22:50.942
next time get both hips replaced.

22:52.479 --> 22:55.380
Assholes.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.223
Excuse me there, bud.

23:05.258 --> 23:08.259
Uh, you know,
I seem to have gotten a little bit lost.

23:08.295 --> 23:10.261
Maybe you could help me out here.

23:10.297 --> 23:12.464
Sure. I'm tourist information today...
where you going?

23:12.499 --> 23:14.466
So we are heading, um,

23:14.501 --> 23:17.846
to the east, and we need a...

23:17.865 --> 23:19.531
I'm trying to get on the 29 here.

23:19.566 --> 23:20.905
Yeah, that's where
your finger's pointing...

23:20.905 --> 23:22.243
- Right there, the 29.
- That's right.

23:22.243 --> 23:24.970
But I-I can't figure
out how to get to it.

23:25.005 --> 23:27.806
See right out there where
it says turn left to the 29?

23:28.588 --> 23:30.642
That's how you get to the 29.

23:31.117 --> 23:34.419
Oh. Okay, that would make sense.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.787
What?

23:35.822 --> 23:37.288
What are you two zibs doing?

23:37.324 --> 23:39.023
You should be more careful with this,
sir.

23:39.059 --> 23:41.092
What the hell?
Are you trying to lift my card, asshole?

23:41.127 --> 23:43.495
Hey, he's not an asshole.
You're the asshole.

23:43.530 --> 23:46.130
Oh, my God, an American eagle.

23:49.069 --> 23:51.135
Go, go, go!

23:51.682 --> 23:52.871
He's coming!

23:52.906 --> 23:54.873
- I know! I know!
- Go, go, go!

23:54.908 --> 23:57.308
- I'm going, I'm going!
- Go, go!

23:57.344 --> 23:58.877
- Okay!
- Turn, turn, turn!

23:58.912 --> 24:01.346
- I'm turning!
- Oh, God!

24:01.381 --> 24:02.680
That did not go well!

24:02.716 --> 24:04.382
I know! I was there!

24:06.777 --> 24:10.613
His big hobby, his passion is darts.

24:11.779 --> 24:14.246
- Yeah.
- No, he's in a darts league

24:14.282 --> 24:18.017
that competes every Friday at
a pub called St. James's Well.

24:18.052 --> 24:19.618
Am I the only one

24:19.654 --> 24:21.720
who thinks there's something
off about this job?

24:21.756 --> 24:23.255
The only thing off is Maddie's focus.

24:23.291 --> 24:24.623
Oh, give me a break, Max.

24:24.659 --> 24:26.425
Maddie, I want to make
something very clear.

24:26.461 --> 24:29.028
This job happens to be of
special interest to the Doctor.

24:29.063 --> 24:31.430
Max is just freaking out
'cause I had coffee

24:31.466 --> 24:33.232
and talked to some guy at a coffee shop.

24:33.267 --> 24:35.468
No, it's the way
that you were talking to him

24:35.503 --> 24:37.570
that concerns me.

24:38.394 --> 24:39.438
You know what, Sal?

24:39.474 --> 24:42.041
Why don't you tell her about Tulsa?

24:42.076 --> 24:43.609
- Max...
- No, tell her, Sal.

24:43.644 --> 24:46.979
- She needs to know.
- What?

24:47.014 --> 24:50.649
What happened in Tulsa?

24:52.854 --> 24:56.055
It was almost ten years ago, I guess.

24:56.090 --> 24:58.257
We'd just started
working for the Doctor.

24:58.292 --> 25:00.125
It was a...

25:00.161 --> 25:02.828
a long game... a real-estate scam...

25:02.864 --> 25:04.830
and about the hottest
summer you can imagine,

25:04.866 --> 25:06.465
so I went to the movies a lot.

25:06.501 --> 25:09.468
And this guy was...

25:09.504 --> 25:12.104
sitting a few seats from me one night,

25:12.139 --> 25:15.074
and he offered me some Junior Mints.

25:15.534 --> 25:17.076
His name was Martin.

25:17.111 --> 25:20.279
<i>And he was...</i>

25:20.314 --> 25:23.649
<i>just about the sweetest guy I ever met.</i>

25:23.684 --> 25:26.085
We just seem to fit.

25:26.120 --> 25:29.421
<i>You know, sometimes
you get a taste of real life,</i>

25:29.457 --> 25:31.857
and it seems pretty all right.

25:31.893 --> 25:34.660
You start daydreaming, you know...

25:34.695 --> 25:37.162
about getting out for good.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.100
So what happened?

25:41.135 --> 25:45.104
<i>Well, let's just say the
Doctor sent me a message...</i>

25:45.139 --> 25:47.873
<i>a little reminder</i>

25:47.909 --> 25:50.843
<i>that anybody not in the life,
not like us,</i>

25:50.878 --> 25:53.012
<i>is a liability.</i>

25:57.351 --> 26:01.887
And if you care about those people,
you know...

26:03.157 --> 26:05.190
you have to be careful.

26:08.838 --> 26:09.695
And sweet Max...

26:11.125 --> 26:12.331
was there to put me back together,

26:12.366 --> 26:13.866
weren't you, Maxie?

26:13.901 --> 26:17.570
Anything for you, Sal. You know that.

26:21.576 --> 26:23.142
Ahh.

26:23.177 --> 26:25.477
All right, I get it.

26:25.513 --> 26:29.348
But this guy at the coffee shop...

26:29.383 --> 26:30.549
he's a nobody.

26:30.585 --> 26:32.918
You don't have to worry.

26:32.954 --> 26:35.020
Really, I'm on it.

27:12.393 --> 27:13.759
Want something?

27:13.794 --> 27:16.595
Yeah. I'll have a Manhattan, please.

27:16.631 --> 27:18.063
- Mm-hmm.
- Keep the change.

27:18.099 --> 27:19.565
I need a little favor.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.967
You know what? Put it on our tab.

27:22.003 --> 27:24.203
- Hi.
- No, thanks.

27:24.238 --> 27:26.205
Why not?

27:26.240 --> 27:29.375
If I let you, it'll cost me more.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.410
All right, all right, fair enough.

27:31.445 --> 27:34.780
How about if I can get you
to say the word "seventeen"?

27:36.651 --> 27:38.417
- Hmm?
- I bet I can get you

27:38.452 --> 27:40.419
to say "seventeen," and if I do,

27:40.454 --> 27:41.920
you have to join us.

27:41.956 --> 27:43.822
- You're on.
- All right.

27:43.858 --> 27:45.290
- What's two plus two?
- Four.

27:45.326 --> 27:46.792
- Four plus four?
- Eight.

27:46.827 --> 27:48.293
- Eight plus eight?
- Sixteen.

27:48.329 --> 27:50.162
See, I told you I could get you
to say "sixteen."

27:50.197 --> 27:53.599
- No, you said "sevente"...
- See? What?

27:54.151 --> 27:55.434
You walked right into that one.

27:55.469 --> 27:57.436
Okay, I'm impressed.

27:57.471 --> 28:00.105
All right, you can buy me a drink now.

28:00.141 --> 28:02.074
- All right.
- What's going on here?

28:02.109 --> 28:03.575
Mr. Heller.

28:03.611 --> 28:07.012
Gary, you... know this one?

28:07.048 --> 28:08.250
Ms. Keyes works for me.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.816
Really? Give your HR person a bonus.

28:10.851 --> 28:12.251
All right, all right.

28:14.855 --> 28:16.188
What are you doing here?

28:16.223 --> 28:18.023
I live right around the corner.

28:18.059 --> 28:19.792
Just getting to know the city.

28:19.827 --> 28:21.260
Is this a good spot?

28:21.295 --> 28:23.028
Well, you have to go where the darts are

28:23.064 --> 28:24.196
if you're in a darts league.

28:24.231 --> 28:25.664
Big darts game tonight?

28:26.338 --> 28:27.266
Match.

28:27.301 --> 28:29.535
It's called a darts match.

28:29.570 --> 28:32.805
Oh. Big darts match tonight?

28:35.342 --> 28:37.276
You know, the game of darts goes back

28:37.311 --> 28:40.212
to the Battle of Agincourt
in the 15th century.

28:40.247 --> 28:44.049
The first dartboard was actually
the cross section of a tree.

28:44.085 --> 28:45.484
Wow.

28:45.519 --> 28:47.686
You're a real enthusiast.

28:47.722 --> 28:50.055
I kind of like history in general.

28:50.091 --> 28:52.491
I like the perspective
on why things happen.

28:52.526 --> 28:54.693
Hmm. Hmm.

28:54.729 --> 28:56.862
Never been my favorite subject.

28:56.897 --> 29:00.699
I do love old movies, like "Casablanca."

29:00.735 --> 29:03.869
Mm, that's kind of history, right?

29:06.340 --> 29:09.074
Ms. Keyes,
you are a breath of fresh air.

29:09.110 --> 29:11.510
Call me Saffron. We're not at work.

29:11.545 --> 29:14.880
Gary, more vodka shooters
before I take your money.

29:14.915 --> 29:16.215
Your turn, big guy.

29:16.250 --> 29:19.218
No, no, no, no, no,
no, my turn, my turn.

29:19.253 --> 29:22.321
Oh, and, um, when I come back,

29:22.356 --> 29:24.523
will you teach me how to shoot a dart?

29:24.558 --> 29:26.225
Okay, but are you sure you don't want

29:26.260 --> 29:28.427
the reigning champ to teach you?

29:28.462 --> 29:31.530
Positive. I imagine
Gary knows what he's doing.

29:35.136 --> 29:38.904
Vodka, vodka, water.

29:38.939 --> 29:40.710
Drink them under the table.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.909
Ahh!

29:50.584 --> 29:52.184
Okay, okay, okay.

29:52.219 --> 29:53.919
There's a lot of money on that table...
I'm nervous.

29:53.954 --> 29:55.854
No, no, I got your covered.
Don't worry about it.

29:55.890 --> 29:58.924
Don't believe him!
Gary's not exactly on a winning streak.

29:58.959 --> 30:00.926
Ignore that. Just ignore that.
Focus just on this.

30:00.961 --> 30:02.561
Breathe. Just breathe.

30:02.691 --> 30:04.134
Do it!

30:08.769 --> 30:11.970
Aah! Oh, my gosh! In your face!

30:12.006 --> 30:13.272
That is bullshit!

30:13.307 --> 30:15.407
No, no, no, that is such bullshit.

30:15.442 --> 30:16.875
Let's go again, double or nothing.

30:16.911 --> 30:18.477
Double or nothing, let's go again.

30:18.512 --> 30:20.145
- Let's go again.
- Don't be a sore loser, Freddy.

30:20.181 --> 30:22.080
I think I better quit while I'm ahead.

30:22.116 --> 30:24.583
Hey, Gary is a pussy, okay?
You don't have to be a pussy.

30:24.618 --> 30:26.785
And he's, like, so cranky.
He's so cranky.

30:26.821 --> 30:28.821
Ever since Patty left
him for the pool boy...

30:30.023 --> 30:31.156
Keep talking, Freddy. Keep talking.

30:31.192 --> 30:32.958
- Jesus, calm down.
- Keep talking.

30:32.993 --> 30:35.160
- Apologize to the lady.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

30:35.196 --> 30:36.962
- Apologize to the lady.
- Relax, man!

30:36.997 --> 30:39.398
Gary, Gary, can we please
just get out of here?

30:41.202 --> 30:43.402
Please?

31:25.340 --> 31:26.872
What the hell?

31:28.201 --> 31:30.012
Sorry I lost my temper back there.

31:31.856 --> 31:34.824
No, it's okay.
You were just defending my honor.

31:38.863 --> 31:42.298
I don't feel so good.

31:46.871 --> 31:49.038
Get you a glass of water.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.047
I know people say you're a jerk, but...

32:00.518 --> 32:03.853
they just don't know the real you.

32:12.731 --> 32:15.865
I'm just gonna put this here.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.500
You're gonna need that.

32:17.963 --> 32:20.870
Oh, and a truckload of aspirin.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.911
Get some sleep.

32:47.996 --> 32:49.098
<i>Hello?</i>

32:49.134 --> 32:51.901
So this barbecue on Saturday...

32:51.936 --> 32:54.504
<i>- Yes?</i>
- I was just wondering

32:54.539 --> 32:57.540
if there was gonna be a
smoked brisket involved.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.542
<i>Wait. So you'll come based on the meat?</i>

32:59.935 --> 33:00.890
Yes.

33:01.379 --> 33:03.112
Yes, that's the deciding factor.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.114
<i>Done. So what's up for tonight?</i>

33:05.150 --> 33:07.550
Uh, not much.

33:07.585 --> 33:10.353
Just a quiet evening at home.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.055
You?

33:12.090 --> 33:14.557
<i>Not a lot... just getting
my daily dose of jazz.</i>

33:14.592 --> 33:16.125
<i>You hear it?</i>

33:16.161 --> 33:18.361
Love that one.

33:18.396 --> 33:20.797
Crank it up.

33:30.686 --> 33:32.442
You've got something
right here on your...

33:32.477 --> 33:33.776
- Me?
- What is that... ketchup?

33:33.812 --> 33:35.144
- What?
- Huh?

33:35.180 --> 33:36.379
- Okay, not bad.
- You felt it?

33:36.414 --> 33:37.447
- A bit, a bit.
- Ah.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.582
- Okay, my turn.
- All right.

33:40.103 --> 33:41.610
Taxi!

33:42.153 --> 33:43.786
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No worries.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.588
Ooh, man, only
a slight breeze that time.

33:45.623 --> 33:47.156
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's getting better.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.791
All right. Ready for some driving?

33:48.827 --> 33:50.927
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Let's go.

33:52.831 --> 33:55.164
I could use a little
"Viva La Vida" right about now.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.799
Okay, how about this?

33:56.835 --> 33:58.968
From now on, whoever has the
wallet controls the radio.

33:59.003 --> 34:02.605
Deal, baby. Let the game begin.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.806
What the...

34:03.842 --> 34:05.408
How'd you do that?

34:05.443 --> 34:08.110
- Thank you.
- Son of a bitch.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.208
<i>"At the bottom of every frozen heart,</i>

34:39.244 --> 34:42.378
<i>there is a drop or two of love..."</i>

34:42.413 --> 34:43.612
Till death do us part.

34:43.648 --> 34:46.014
<i>"Just enough to feed a birds."</i>

34:54.692 --> 34:56.692
This better work.

34:59.497 --> 35:01.697
- It's sourdough, right?
- Yep. Here you go.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.733
Thanks.

35:03.768 --> 35:06.068
It's all old folks.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.904
Not an asshole in sight.

35:09.027 --> 35:10.239
Should we just go?

35:10.275 --> 35:11.507
Oh. You know...

35:11.543 --> 35:13.209
Hey, does "wheat"

35:13.244 --> 35:15.811
sound anything like "sourdough"?

35:15.847 --> 35:18.247
You know, put a nickel in it, honey.

35:18.283 --> 35:21.250
Assholes trump old people.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.585
Good amendment.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.554
It's a living document.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.489
Mustard dip. Ready?

35:26.524 --> 35:29.692
<i>The mustard dip... a simple
yet effective small-time con.</i>

35:29.727 --> 35:31.838
- You know the secret to making toast?
<i>- Pick a mark with a calm,</i>

35:31.838 --> 35:34.023
<i>- easygoing temperament.</i>
- You toast it!

35:35.300 --> 35:38.901
<i>Next, casually spill a
condiment of your choosing</i>

35:38.937 --> 35:40.236
<i>on your unsuspecting mark.</i>

35:40.271 --> 35:41.904
Here, let me give you a hand.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.805
<i>Now, in one simple, fluid motion,</i>

35:43.875 --> 35:45.642
<i>remove your mark's jacket.</i>

35:45.677 --> 35:48.111
<i>This should be done without
effort or aggression.</i>

35:48.146 --> 35:51.514
<i>Finally, extract the wallet
just as your partner appears</i>

35:51.550 --> 35:52.983
<i>to seamlessly abscond with it.</i>

35:53.628 --> 35:56.850
<i>Perfect in elegance and simplicity.</i>

35:58.132 --> 36:00.533
This man stole my wallet!

36:00.568 --> 36:01.767
<i>Well done.</i>

36:01.803 --> 36:03.436
Whoa. No, he did not.

36:03.998 --> 36:05.071
Here... It's here.

36:05.106 --> 36:07.106
I found it. It's on the floor.

36:07.141 --> 36:08.941
You should be nicer.

36:08.977 --> 36:10.977
Eat a D, Nancy.

36:13.348 --> 36:14.747
Sorry about that.

36:14.782 --> 36:16.315
Dude, that was so embarrassing, man.

36:16.351 --> 36:17.682
Dude, we suck.

36:17.986 --> 36:18.989
Hey.

36:20.588 --> 36:22.755
I took it right out
before I gave it back.

36:23.179 --> 36:24.423
I knew we had it, man!

36:24.459 --> 36:25.958
- Shh!
- Way to go, dude.

36:25.994 --> 36:27.760
Ooh, gets you all...
adrenaline, endorphins.

36:27.795 --> 36:29.762
- I know.
- It's like a drug.

36:29.797 --> 36:31.264
I know.

36:31.299 --> 36:33.332
Hey, you think this is how she felt

36:33.368 --> 36:36.135
when she took us?

36:36.170 --> 36:38.771
I mean, what if we don't
even recognize her?

36:38.806 --> 36:40.184
She might not recognize us.

36:42.443 --> 36:44.577
Whew. We need to get cleaned up, man.

36:44.612 --> 36:46.612
We're less than an hour away.

36:54.191 --> 36:55.791
Going out for a few hours, Viv.

36:55.826 --> 36:58.994
- See you later.
- Okay, have good day.

38:25.276 --> 38:28.076
- Good. You're still here.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Heller.

38:28.112 --> 38:31.914
I almost done and, uh, get out of here.

38:31.949 --> 38:33.248
I go now.

38:33.284 --> 38:35.017
No, stay.

38:35.052 --> 38:36.451
Please.

38:36.487 --> 38:38.420
There's something I
want to ask you about.

38:38.455 --> 38:40.289
Sure, yeah.

38:40.324 --> 38:41.857
So this girl...

38:41.892 --> 38:45.060
- Saffron.
- Oh, such a pretty name.

38:45.095 --> 38:46.461
And you like her?

38:46.497 --> 38:50.065
So what problem?

38:50.100 --> 38:52.868
I had a fiancée...

38:52.903 --> 38:56.438
not so long ago,
and it did not end well for me.

38:56.473 --> 38:59.641
Oh, the heart is strong muscle.

38:59.677 --> 39:01.276
It spring back.

39:01.312 --> 39:04.313
You ready for the love again.

39:04.348 --> 39:06.582
Yeah, but I don't know if this
is the kind of woman that...

39:06.617 --> 39:09.651
Come, Mr. Heller, you handsome man.

39:09.687 --> 39:12.387
Don't.

39:12.423 --> 39:14.289
I know how people see me.

39:17.094 --> 39:20.662
But this Saffron make you feel good.

39:22.499 --> 39:23.665
Yeah.

39:23.701 --> 39:26.301
She makes me want to...

39:26.337 --> 39:27.970
be nice.

39:30.174 --> 39:33.609
I think you have good
luck with this girl.

39:34.499 --> 39:36.311
<i>If there's any way we could see the room</i>

39:36.347 --> 39:38.614
before paying for it...

39:38.649 --> 39:42.284
um, we just want to make sure
the room is up to our standards.

39:42.319 --> 39:44.152
We don't usually let
people see the rooms

39:44.188 --> 39:45.787
before they check in.

39:45.823 --> 39:49.458
I guess they just
don't want us here, babe.

39:53.964 --> 39:56.131
You want to carry me
over the threshold, too?

39:56.166 --> 39:58.634
Yeah, you wish. Let's hurry this up.

40:02.139 --> 40:04.573
Are you coming out anytime this year?

40:07.244 --> 40:10.879
Crap, I think we're out of hot water.

40:12.983 --> 40:14.516
Hey, man, you want to use this?

40:14.551 --> 40:15.617
Eat shit!

40:20.758 --> 40:22.190
Hello, Alice.

40:22.226 --> 40:24.359
Hello, Ava.

40:26.029 --> 40:27.362
We decided against it.

40:27.398 --> 40:28.964
Um, not enough...

40:28.999 --> 40:30.198
natural light.

40:30.234 --> 40:32.134
Thank you.

40:43.414 --> 40:44.880
This is it.

41:02.462 --> 41:03.380
What's up?

41:05.436 --> 41:08.203
- She's in there.
- Yeah.

41:08.238 --> 41:10.008
Okay, whatever happens...

41:10.240 --> 41:12.774
- Good luck.
- Yeah, man, you too.

41:12.810 --> 41:16.411
All right, mother-frickin' Avon calling.

41:21.618 --> 41:24.186
<i>Let's meet Julia and her husband, John.</i>

41:31.395 --> 41:33.195
<i>John, you love your wife a lot, right?</i>

41:33.230 --> 41:34.262
Just a minute.

41:34.298 --> 41:35.864
<i>All right.</i>

41:44.615 --> 41:45.947
Yeah?

41:45.983 --> 41:48.383
Uh, that'll be $16.75.

41:48.418 --> 41:49.751
- Here you go.
- Great.

41:49.786 --> 41:51.453
Who the hell are you?

41:51.588 --> 41:53.421
Who the hell are you?

41:53.457 --> 41:55.624
Do you know this woman?

41:58.795 --> 42:02.130
Are you kidding me? She's my wife.

42:02.165 --> 42:04.232
No way.

42:05.979 --> 42:06.902
Is she dead?

42:06.937 --> 42:08.904
- What?
- No.

42:08.939 --> 42:10.739
- No, wait.
- Hold on, hold on.

42:10.774 --> 42:12.474
We want to ask you
some questions, please.

42:12.509 --> 42:14.376
