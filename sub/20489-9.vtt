00:43.243 --> 00:46.246
Well. See, it's no reason
to stop the party now, guys.

00:46.281 --> 00:49.249
Especially since you got
me right where i want you.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.074
You know, when is
that guy gonna learn?

01:15.109 --> 01:16.876
No matter how many
guys he sends after us,

01:16.911 --> 01:18.878
you're always outnumbered.

03:17.397 --> 03:18.998
Huh?

03:19.033 --> 03:20.565
Nice.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.001
Well,
thank you very much.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.368
But where
the hell were you?

03:23.403 --> 03:25.405
You said you'd be at
fawcett avenue near briggs.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.807
No, what i said
was that's where i figured
they'd catch up with me.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.809
Yeah, and that's
where i was waiting.

03:29.844 --> 03:31.411
Oh, waiting.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.012
Well, who would've guessed
that you'd beat me there?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.214
Coming, or what?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.226
Twenty bucks.

03:46.261 --> 03:48.193
What?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.829
We both agreed, first one
to use their powers pays

03:49.864 --> 03:51.396
the other one twenty bucks.

03:51.431 --> 03:53.833
You know,
i should've let them crack
you in the back of the head.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.237
No.

03:57.272 --> 03:58.203
Yeah.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.804
Twenty bucks.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.005
Okay,
you know what?

04:01.040 --> 04:02.242
You're just lucky
i'm a man of my word.

04:02.277 --> 04:03.042
Uh huh.

04:03.443 --> 04:04.209
Ow.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.445
Oh, gee,
i'm sorry.

04:05.845 --> 04:07.011
I... i must have rubbed
my feet on the carpet.

04:07.046 --> 04:08.648
Yeah, you know,
i never would've taken
you for a sore loser.

04:08.683 --> 04:09.814
Keep it up.

04:09.849 --> 04:11.050
I'll show you
what sore really means.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.252
Oh, really? That
sounds like a threat.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.793
Mom.

07:06.828 --> 07:08.795
Josh.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.203
Josh.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.613
Oh, my god.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.215
He's gone.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.020
I'll call the police.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.633
Joshua valentine, ten-year-old
son of big-time hero

07:48.034 --> 07:52.038
corbin valentine was snatched
from the family home...

07:52.073 --> 07:53.639
see, now you know why
i don't want to be famous.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.206
Who's corbin valentine?

07:55.241 --> 07:57.443
You know, the astronaut
who saved the shuttle crew?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.645
The one that crashed into
the french space station.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.812
Oh, yeah.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.413
Yeah, i vaguely
remember that.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.851
What good is
that congressional medal of
honour doing him now, huh?

08:04.886 --> 08:07.653
But the real question
is why joshua valentine...

08:08.054 --> 08:10.021
off.

08:10.056 --> 08:12.859
Well, proxy blue's
right on the money.

08:12.894 --> 08:14.861
Lisa valentine's a new mutant.

08:14.896 --> 08:16.828
So's her son.

08:16.863 --> 08:20.031
You think the gsa's
behind the kidnapping?

08:20.066 --> 08:22.869
Can't see eckhart doing
something that would attract

08:22.904 --> 08:24.488
this kind of attention.

08:24.523 --> 08:26.098
He's more subtle than that.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.673
Well, what can the boy do?

08:27.708 --> 08:28.840
Thermal transfer.

08:28.875 --> 08:32.443
Although his abilities are,
you know, barely developed.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.480
I know when
i was ten i could barely
jump-start a car battery.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.248
You were boosting
cars when you were ten?

08:37.283 --> 08:40.086
I was just, you know,
helping people out when
they had a dead battery.

08:40.121 --> 08:42.087
Ah, a regular good samaritan.

08:42.123 --> 08:43.254
Exactly.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.691
So you think this is just
a run-of-the mill kidnapping?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.293
With a new mutant twist.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.295
Which means we need
to bring him home safe.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.862
Right.

08:50.897 --> 08:54.300
Now, corbin valentine has
a kidnap and ransom policy.

08:54.335 --> 08:57.703
So, emma, you and i are
going undercover as insurance

08:57.738 --> 09:00.907
investigators,
see what we can find out.

09:00.942 --> 09:02.473
Should be fun.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.475
And what about
the real k & r team?

09:04.510 --> 09:06.512
Yeah, well, why don't
you find them and throw them

09:06.547 --> 09:08.915
a little telempathic diversion?

09:09.315 --> 09:12.518
Shalimar, i want you to
track all the physical evidence.

09:12.553 --> 09:13.719
You got it.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.923
You're in
charge of monitoring the
wall, for tech support.

09:16.958 --> 09:18.524
Let's go.

09:22.128 --> 09:25.331
You run a
scan of every media item you
can turn up on valentine.

09:25.366 --> 09:26.950
Oh, wait, wait, hold it.

09:26.985 --> 09:28.534
Adam left me in charge.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.136
Oh, is that right?

09:30.171 --> 09:30.937
Yeah.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.538
Oh.

09:32.939 --> 09:35.341
Because from where i was
sitting it seemed like

09:35.376 --> 09:36.943
he was talking to me.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.357
When lisa valentine was
contacted, she made it clear she

09:51.392 --> 09:53.724
didn't want
anything to do with us.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.562
Well, once we get inside,
she's going to find out

09:56.963 --> 09:58.965
i'm a psionic pretty fast.

09:59.365 --> 10:00.932
Well,
we're here to find her son.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.568
She's just going
to have to deal with it.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.983
Hello. Zoller and denonno.

10:17.018 --> 10:18.584
Barbican k & r.

10:18.985 --> 10:22.989
Sac wendy stone.

10:23.024 --> 10:24.555
Trainee?

10:24.590 --> 10:25.791
Trauma
counseling intern.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.793
Any ransom demand yet?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.360
No, not yet.

10:29.395 --> 10:30.962
But it's on its way.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.399
This place has a highly
advanced security system.

10:33.434 --> 10:35.801
So whoever pulled this
obviously hacked his way in.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.403
Guy's a pro.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.405
Where's mrs. Valentine?

10:51.817 --> 10:53.784
You can counsel the
valentines if you like,

10:53.819 --> 10:57.023
but if you compromise my
investigation, you're history.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.425
Farthest thing from our minds.

10:59.825 --> 11:03.029
Hello?

11:03.429 --> 11:05.631
This is agent denonno.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.833
I'm investigator zoller.

11:27.053 --> 11:29.055
Looks like he rapelled
down from the kid's room,

11:29.455 --> 11:31.022
then took off in a car.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.024
The place is crawling with feds.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.061
I'm gonna come back later, see
if i can get a little closer.

11:35.096 --> 11:36.662
We'll be here.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.266
Let's play nice, boys.

11:56.282 --> 11:57.883
You know, you keep
chowing down like that,

11:58.284 --> 11:59.885
you're going to be
all mass, all the time.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.253
Oh, did adam put you in
charge of a pizza now?

12:02.288 --> 12:05.891
I thought
rich kids were supposed
to be well-mannered.

12:06.292 --> 12:09.095
I have perfectly
fine manners.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.913
Get away
from the window.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.515
C'mon.

12:32.318 --> 12:33.919
What's all that stuff?

12:34.320 --> 12:35.921
That's none
of your damn business.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.726
I want to go home.

12:43.129 --> 12:46.732
When my dad pays you,
then can i go home?

12:46.767 --> 12:50.336
Any more whining,
you're not going anywhere.

12:50.371 --> 12:53.539
How did you do this?

12:53.574 --> 12:55.506
I don't know.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.108
When i get afraid,
it just happens.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.545
What? You light matches
and throw 'em at people?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.912
Huh?

13:01.947 --> 13:05.551
Try it again,
you'll find out what
trouble really means.

13:05.586 --> 13:07.553
Come on.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.130
I'll be back.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.366
Don't try anything.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.969
And i'm gonna need a
list of family and friends,

13:24.004 --> 13:25.971
acquaintances,
anybody who knew your son.

13:50.396 --> 13:53.164
Why don't we...

13:53.199 --> 13:55.601
why don't we step over here?

14:05.211 --> 14:07.978
Lisa?

14:08.013 --> 14:09.615
Are you all right?

14:09.650 --> 14:11.182
Yeah.

14:11.217 --> 14:12.818
When we first arrived,
i couldn't read her.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.385
She was a blank wall.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.623
But i just intercepted
a psychic link
between her and joshua.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.625
He's calling out to her.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.192
Good.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.629
Maybe she can't block you
because she's so vulnerable.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.596
Yeah, maybe.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.033
Alright, and see if you
can continue to read her,

14:28.068 --> 14:30.035
but without
revealing who you are.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.037
Assuming
she'll trust me.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.415
The assignment was simple
and straightforward.

14:44.450 --> 14:47.252
But as yet,
your investigation
has turned up nothing.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.055
It took a great deal of effort
to convince the fbi to back

14:50.090 --> 14:52.858
off and let us carry the ball.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.860
The mother is a telepath.

14:55.261 --> 14:58.864
She must have some sort
of connection with her son.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.468
I suggest you use that
connection to your advantage.

15:02.503 --> 15:05.236
Absolutely, sir.

15:05.271 --> 15:10.476
We'll deal with mrs. Valentine.

15:10.511 --> 15:12.042
You do what you have to.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.079
She's of no interest
to me whatsoever.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.081
The boy's a priceless commodity.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.083
Bring him to me, ms stone.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.085
And make it soon.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.498
Lunch time.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.105
Hope you like cheeseburgers.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.678
You're big news, kid.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.115
That means
everybody's looking for me.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.885
So they're coming
to get me, right?

15:54.920 --> 15:56.922
They're scrambling for
the ransom money right now.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.924
This'll all be
over before you know it.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.543
What does that mean?

16:00.578 --> 16:02.127
It means what i said.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.729
Arghh.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.339
What'd i tell you,
you little freak?

16:13.739 --> 16:14.740
I can't help it.

16:14.775 --> 16:15.706
It's not my fault.

16:15.741 --> 16:16.942
How the hell
did you do that?

16:16.977 --> 16:18.108
Let me go.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.710
I want to see my mom.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.347
Keep... keep your hands
where i can see 'em.

16:21.382 --> 16:22.548
Up, up.

16:22.948 --> 16:26.151
I already told you
everything's gonna be fine.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.720
You're going on a trip.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.357
I don't want
to go on a trip.

16:31.392 --> 16:32.958
I want to go home.

17:02.988 --> 17:04.990
This is odd.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.957
I smell sulphur.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.993
Maybe the kidnapper
brushed by here.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.413
Send us a sample.

17:10.448 --> 17:11.797
We'll do an analysis.

17:11.832 --> 17:13.398
We?

17:13.799 --> 17:15.401
Yeah. What, do you
want me to do it myself?

17:15.435 --> 17:17.367
No, i'll handle it.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.003
Your lab work's
still a little sloppy.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.406
Oh, kind of like
your eating habits?

17:29.815 --> 17:31.817
It's petroleum-based.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.786
You vultures make me sick.

17:35.821 --> 17:39.425
Souvenir
hunting in the midst of
somebody else's tragedy.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.427
Beat it.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.034
I'm going to wait for
josh at my sister's.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.601
Lisa,
we're wasting time.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.038
Look, you're
here for psychological
support, right?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.640
Support i need
is to be left alone.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.241
I can help you.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.243
I know all about your gift.

17:58.278 --> 18:02.212
I'm a telempath.

18:02.247 --> 18:06.652
I can pick up other people's
feelings and emotions.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.455
What about you?

18:09.855 --> 18:11.822
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:11.857 --> 18:14.625
We both
know that you've got a
psychic link to your son.

18:14.660 --> 18:19.465
Now,
somehow you're serving as a
connection between me and josh.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.668
I keep picking
up these images from you.

18:22.703 --> 18:27.473
Lisa, we could
find him together.

18:27.873 --> 18:31.076
Just let the fbi
handle this, okay?

18:45.891 --> 18:48.293
There's been
a ransom demand.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.903
Hey, guys.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.104
Hey.

18:59.505 --> 19:00.671
Hey, shal.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.673
So i talked to emma.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.110
She got a flash of joshua in
the dark with pennies falling

19:05.145 --> 19:07.077
all around him.

19:07.112 --> 19:08.679
Maybe it's the ransom.

19:08.714 --> 19:09.915
Well,
she said it's a symbol.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.882
Not necessarily literal.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.920
Okay,
so we got the kid and we
got pennies falling and we

19:14.955 --> 19:17.923
got the oil and sulphur that
you got from the tree bark.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.490
Yeah.

19:19.525 --> 19:20.726
Marine oil.

19:20.761 --> 19:22.292
Yeah.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.529
Do you
have to do that?

19:23.564 --> 19:25.348
What?

19:25.383 --> 19:27.097
What?

19:27.132 --> 19:28.734
It helps me think.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.335
So maybe this guy...

19:30.736 --> 19:32.337
you know,
maybe this guy works
at the docks somewhere.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.740
Or, maybe the
guy has some yacht.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.341
Hey.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.709
No,
i'm serious.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.711
Maybe this
kidnapper has a boat.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.748
So the
kid's on a boat surrounded
by lots and lots of money.

19:42.783 --> 19:44.349
Pennies.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.351
Yeah, a kid's
idea of lots of money.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.171
Maybe it's
not even money.

19:49.206 --> 19:51.957
Pennies, copper, circles.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.559
Lincoln.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.561
Lincoln.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.963
Lincoln fiduciary.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.530
Lincoln motors.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.166
Lincoln all-american export.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.733
Lincoln salvage.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.334
Oh,
went bankrupt last year.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.371
Hmm, they got a
waterfront address.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.938
Oh.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.575
Listen, why don't
you guys check it out?

20:09.610 --> 20:10.776
Let me know
when you get there.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.178
I think k & r
should be the ones to
deliver joshua to his

20:13.213 --> 20:15.581
parents, so i'll
let adam and emma know.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.389
Won't be
long now, kid.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.991
For what?

20:38.003 --> 20:40.405
Couldn't you find
some place a little homier?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.808
Good to see you.

20:42.843 --> 20:44.009
Hands up.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.411
You know it's not going to
help you, kevlar, head to toe.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.004
Why didn't you zap him?

21:14.039 --> 21:16.041
Because.
The boat is metal.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.043
Now, if i would've
hit him with an arc,
then we'd all be toast.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.645
All right.
We'll take care of him later.

21:19.680 --> 21:20.846
Let's get
the kid out of here.

21:20.881 --> 21:22.465
You're like me.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.049
Both of you.

21:24.084 --> 21:25.215
What?

21:25.250 --> 21:26.451
Water affects
your powers, too, kid?

21:26.486 --> 21:28.470
What's that?

21:28.505 --> 21:30.420
Ah, it's...

21:30.455 --> 21:33.258
a little something
the kidnapper left behind.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.467
Hey.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.671
Josh, c'mon. Go.

22:36.488 --> 22:38.490
I can't begin
to express our gratitude.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.656
Thank you.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.693
Yeah, well, we're very
happy that your son's safe,

22:41.728 --> 22:43.295
but we're still concerned...

22:43.695 --> 22:45.297
joshua needs some rest.

22:45.332 --> 22:47.699
Come on, honey.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.508
My wife's
been through a lot.

22:56.908 --> 22:58.510
If you could
see yourselves out?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.522
No.

23:20.532 --> 23:21.733
I keep getting
the same vision.

23:23.335 --> 23:26.538
Someone's trying
to grab joshua, but
i can't see their face.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.140
The kidnapper?

23:28.540 --> 23:30.142
No, someone else.

23:33.345 --> 23:34.911
What's this?

23:34.946 --> 23:37.749
Well, this is an itinerary
for two to switzerland,

23:37.784 --> 23:39.751
leaving tonight
in the name of penrose.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.953
They've ordered
a kid's meal.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.720
Oh,
i didn't notice that.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.757
One of the tickets
must be for josh.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.160
Hmm.
Travelling with a woman.

23:48.195 --> 23:49.726
Hey, guys.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.763
Check out proxy blue.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.166
An american
hero and his wife's terror
has been brought to an end.

23:54.201 --> 23:56.968
Joshua valentine is
home again thanks to the fbi,

23:57.369 --> 23:59.336
who also nabbed the kidnapper.

23:59.371 --> 24:02.174
But the special agent in charge
declined to speak to the press.

24:02.574 --> 24:03.775
That's weird.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.178
Yeah, whoever heard of
a fed who didn't want

24:06.578 --> 24:07.579
a piece of the spotlight?

24:07.614 --> 24:08.580
I couldn't agree more.

24:08.980 --> 24:09.781
Mute.

24:10.182 --> 24:10.982
Alright, hack
into the fbi database...

24:11.017 --> 24:12.184
way ahead of you.

24:12.584 --> 24:14.186
Check out agent stone.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.553
Oh.

24:16.588 --> 24:18.555
There's a shocker.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.192
The fbi's got no record of her.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.397
We should have
checked our own database.

24:25.432 --> 24:27.364
We'd have found
out she's a new mutant.

24:27.399 --> 24:31.803
With the special power to
increase the molecular density

24:32.204 --> 24:35.407
of organic matter.

24:35.442 --> 24:37.374
Heavy.

24:37.409 --> 24:40.177
Stone was working
undercover for eckhart, huh?

24:40.212 --> 24:43.014
Yeah, but why was
the gsa trying to get joshua
back with his parents?

24:43.049 --> 24:45.817
Yeah, i mean, they
gotta know as much about
his abilities as we do.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.419
That's what
i don't understand.

24:47.819 --> 24:50.222
And who's the woman
flying off with josh?

24:50.257 --> 24:51.788
Who knows?

24:51.823 --> 24:54.626
All i know
is i wouldn't want to be
his kidnapper right now.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.431
Who hired you?

25:04.236 --> 25:09.005
Please stop.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.408
There's only so much g-force
the human body can take,

25:11.443 --> 25:16.248
mr. Burke, before it simply
explodes like a crushed grape.

25:21.853 --> 25:25.056
Lisa valentine hired me.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.264
She had her own son kidnapped.

25:32.664 --> 25:33.865
Should i bring her in?

25:33.900 --> 25:35.832
There's no need.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.869
Why would
mrs. Valentine do that?

25:38.270 --> 25:40.272
To keep him away from someone.

25:40.307 --> 25:42.674
I don't know who.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.483
I think we're finished here.

26:47.138 --> 26:49.140
Mom.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.146
Adam.

27:03.154 --> 27:04.555
The connection.

27:04.590 --> 27:05.922
It was so powerful.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.959
Lisa, she wanted me to know.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.926
What?

27:09.961 --> 27:12.729
Corbin just took joshua.

27:12.764 --> 27:17.569
So she had
him kidnapped to protect
him from his own father.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.585
What is this place, dad?

27:33.620 --> 27:35.151
Trust me, josh.

27:35.186 --> 27:36.788
Your mom and i want
to give you the best.

27:36.823 --> 27:37.589
We want...

27:37.989 --> 27:39.155
you want me
not to be a freak.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.792
Please, josh,
you need help, buddy.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.359
Mom was
trying to help me.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.796
You just want
to get rid of me.

27:47.198 --> 27:48.800
Right on time.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.371
You're goggling,
mr. Valentine.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.408
I would've assumed a man of
your reputation could handle any

27:56.443 --> 27:58.027
surprise that might come along.

27:58.062 --> 27:59.576
Why didn't you
tell me you were...

27:59.611 --> 28:02.814
we maintain a firm need-to-know
policy here at the gsa.

28:02.849 --> 28:07.218
Now, do you
prefer josh or joshua?

28:13.625 --> 28:14.826
Josh.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.027
Hey.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.195
What the hell is that thing?

28:19.230 --> 28:21.197
A necessary precaution,
mr. Valentine.

28:21.232 --> 28:23.234
He's not in full control
of his abilities yet.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.637
We don't want any
unfortunate accidents.

28:25.672 --> 28:27.238
Ow.

28:31.643 --> 28:32.844
Josh.

28:38.049 --> 28:41.653
So this must be joshua.

28:42.053 --> 28:46.858
Have you any idea what
a special little boy you are?

28:49.661 --> 28:51.663
Not very talkative, is he?

28:54.866 --> 28:57.268
What do you
think of my world?

28:57.303 --> 28:59.671
I think it sucks.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.876
It's a credit
to the gene pool when
a father's heroic nature

29:04.911 --> 29:08.497
finds its place in the
son, but it can be terribly

29:08.532 --> 29:12.083
disturbing when these
genetic anomalies create such a

29:12.118 --> 29:14.451
turmoil in the family.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.453
I've tried to
explain that to joshua.

29:16.488 --> 29:20.892
He's got a little
glitch in his genetic
makeup that we can fix.

29:21.292 --> 29:24.496
That's why
we're here, right?

29:24.531 --> 29:26.898
Right.

30:00.298 --> 30:03.101
So this whole ransom
demand was a charade, hmm?

30:03.136 --> 30:05.103
A distraction?

30:15.914 --> 30:17.115
Where am i?

30:17.150 --> 30:18.534
It's okay.

30:18.569 --> 30:19.918
You're safe.

30:19.953 --> 30:21.119
My son.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.723
He's gone.

30:25.758 --> 30:27.242
Corbin.

30:27.277 --> 30:28.691
Corbin.

30:28.726 --> 30:31.494
Corbin gave
you a sleeping pill.

30:31.529 --> 30:35.498
It'll be out of your
system in about an hour.

30:35.533 --> 30:38.736
Lisa, do
you have any idea where your
husband might've take josh?

30:38.771 --> 30:40.703
He wants what's
best for his son.

30:40.738 --> 30:43.942
So would corbin ever
talk about whatever plans

30:43.977 --> 30:46.709
he might've
had for josh?

30:46.744 --> 30:52.350
He mentioned this place that
he could take josh for...

30:52.385 --> 30:56.754
they'd make him normal.

30:57.155 --> 31:04.362
Some sort of a secret
genetic bioengineering facility.

31:04.397 --> 31:09.167
You know
where he's taken him.

31:09.202 --> 31:11.569
Yeah.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.571
We got a
pretty good idea.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.577
We'll have to transfer joshua
to another facility in order

31:19.612 --> 31:21.980
to get a full reading on
the extent of his abilities.

31:22.015 --> 31:24.600
But i thought you were
going to neutralize him.

31:24.635 --> 31:27.185
Well, it's a little
more complex than that.

31:27.585 --> 31:31.189
When someone
as special as joshua
is handed over to us,

31:31.589 --> 31:36.794
signed,
sealed and delivered,
well, how can we say no?

31:44.002 --> 31:45.203
Jesse.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.806
Yeah, it looks like valentine's
taking josh over to genomex.

31:48.841 --> 31:50.808
I want you to track
the car, keep tabs on him.

31:50.843 --> 31:52.410
We're heading over there now.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.412
You're covered.

31:56.014 --> 31:58.816
Double helix:
Activate stealth cloak.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.625
Hey, what are you doing?

32:08.026 --> 32:10.428
Well,
adam thinks valentine's
taken the kid to genomex.

32:10.463 --> 32:11.995
Yeah, they're on
their way there now.

32:12.030 --> 32:14.432
Just making sure that
is where they're going.

32:18.036 --> 32:20.003
You hacked into the
nujack satellite system?

32:20.038 --> 32:22.040
Figured a guy like valentine'd
have an expensive car,

32:22.440 --> 32:24.042
he'd want that
kind of security.

32:24.077 --> 32:25.643
Makes sense.

32:26.044 --> 32:27.645
Well,
we find valentine's
car, we find the kid.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.647
How'd you
learn how to do that?

32:29.682 --> 32:30.448
Ha ha.

32:30.848 --> 32:32.015
I taught him.

32:32.050 --> 32:35.253
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

32:35.653 --> 32:37.655
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.222
Hey. Let me do that.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.259
I know the nujack
system inside and out.

32:41.294 --> 32:42.425
You know what?

32:42.460 --> 32:44.062
You never admit you're
a criminal, but you pull this

32:44.097 --> 32:45.663
criminal rank
on me all the time.

32:46.064 --> 32:47.265
Hey. Out.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.070
You guys go work
this out in the dojo.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.679
Got it.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.447
Adam.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.285
Got a bead
on valentine's car.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.486
Good.

33:08.886 --> 33:13.691
Alright,
based on his route, he's
heading for gsa clinic six.

33:13.726 --> 33:16.094
That's what i thought.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.496
Brennan and jesse
are already on their way.

33:38.116 --> 33:39.717
We'll need some
help finding josh.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.319
This place is huge.

33:41.354 --> 33:42.485
All right.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.122
Hang in there.
We'll get back to you.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.926
Lisa, you need
to link to josh and i'll
try to connect through you.

33:48.961 --> 33:50.928
I haven't
been able to find him.

33:51.329 --> 33:52.930
He doesn't seem to be there.

33:52.965 --> 33:54.932
We're a lot closer now.

34:00.938 --> 34:03.741
You're asking
me to do something i
don't know if i can do.

34:03.776 --> 34:05.343
Just try.

34:08.946 --> 34:10.547
I'm not strong.

34:10.947 --> 34:13.751
I spent my whole life
denying i have any power.

34:13.786 --> 34:16.954
I'm not like you, emma.

34:16.989 --> 34:18.920
Yes, you are.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.958
Lisa, you reached me
from your unconscious.

34:21.359 --> 34:24.562
And we can
find him together.

34:24.597 --> 34:26.563
He'll hear us, i promise.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.773
Take her hand.

34:36.174 --> 34:37.375
Try it, please.

35:01.799 --> 35:04.401
He's in a room,
with white walls.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.004
Okay. Okay,
is there a window?

35:11.809 --> 35:13.411
I don't know.

35:41.839 --> 35:43.841
There are four towers
outside of his window.

35:43.876 --> 35:45.443
What kind of towers?

35:45.843 --> 35:47.009
I... i don't know.

35:47.044 --> 35:48.246
It could be a building.

35:48.281 --> 35:49.664
Building.

35:49.699 --> 35:51.048
I got it.

35:51.449 --> 35:52.650
The four
apartment buildings.

35:52.685 --> 35:53.868
All right.

35:53.903 --> 35:55.278
Compound four.

35:55.313 --> 35:56.584
Compound four.

35:56.619 --> 35:57.855
Go there now.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.278
You guys came for me.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.280

ever leave you hanging.

36:22.315 --> 36:23.846

36:23.881 --> 36:26.249

36:26.284 --> 36:30.688
Oh, yeah, you know,

to disengage those.

36:30.723 --> 36:32.290
Cool.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.878
See, kid?

36:55.913 --> 36:57.915
Being a freak definitely
has its good points, huh?

37:08.859 --> 37:10.061
Did they find joshua?

37:10.461 --> 37:12.463
Brennan and jesse
are with him now.

37:12.863 --> 37:14.830
So where do we stand?

37:14.865 --> 37:16.867
Well, i got josh right here,
and jesse's getting the car.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.270
He'll be fine.

37:21.672 --> 37:22.873
Am i going to
see my mom again?

37:22.908 --> 37:24.075
Yeah, buddy.

37:24.475 --> 37:25.676
Count on it.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.444
Wait.

37:28.479 --> 37:31.247
You've got company.

37:31.282 --> 37:33.284
You stay here 'til i tell
you to come out, all right?

37:33.319 --> 37:34.485
Okay.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.691
Joshua.

37:40.726 --> 37:43.411
Joshua?

37:43.446 --> 37:46.097
Josh?

37:53.704 --> 37:56.107
Where's your
backup, miss stone?

37:56.142 --> 37:57.708
The hell with my backup.

37:57.743 --> 37:58.874
Where's the boy?

37:58.909 --> 38:00.511
Don't tell her anything.

38:16.127 --> 38:19.330
Way i see it, you gotta
go through him to hit me.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.332
Now where's the boy?

38:34.545 --> 38:36.147
Get going, josh.

38:36.182 --> 38:37.766
C'mon.

38:37.801 --> 38:39.350
Stop them.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.173
So this is
freak central, huh?

39:02.573 --> 39:03.374
Yup.

39:03.774 --> 39:05.776
Can i stay
here with you guys?

39:05.811 --> 39:07.743
Maybe,
when you're old enough.

39:07.778 --> 39:08.944
And we've got a
height requirement, too.

39:08.979 --> 39:12.183
You know, by the way, good
job with your hands back there.

39:12.218 --> 39:14.585
I saw the way you
did it, and it worked.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.786
Like a charm.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.390
My dad things
something's wrong with me.

39:19.790 --> 39:24.195
You know,
come here. Sit down.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.603
You know, you ask me,
i think he's just afraid.

39:32.638 --> 39:34.022
Afraid?

39:34.057 --> 39:35.332
Yeah.

39:35.367 --> 39:36.607
Of me?

39:37.007 --> 39:38.209
But i'm just a kid.

39:38.609 --> 39:40.611
You know, a lot of
people are afraid of what
they don't understand.

39:41.011 --> 39:44.215
But my dad said he
thought he was helping me.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.582
Take it from me,
he's totally wrong.

39:46.617 --> 39:50.621
I never thought my dad could
be wrong about anything.

39:51.021 --> 39:52.422
He's human.

39:52.457 --> 39:53.789
Just like us.

39:53.824 --> 39:57.027
Well,
not just like us.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.629
Yeah.

39:59.430 --> 40:00.631
Josh.

40:00.666 --> 40:01.797
Mom.

40:01.832 --> 40:03.434
Come here.

40:03.469 --> 40:05.000
Mom.

40:05.035 --> 40:08.639
Oh, i was so
worried about you.

40:08.674 --> 40:10.641
It's okay, mom.

40:11.041 --> 40:13.243
These guys are cool.

40:13.278 --> 40:15.446
They came and saved me.

40:15.481 --> 40:19.049
That's great.

40:19.450 --> 40:21.051
Lisa?

40:28.659 --> 40:30.226
Hey,
you know what?

40:30.261 --> 40:31.862
Let me show you
the rest of this place.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.464
Thanks.

40:41.872 --> 40:44.275
I thought it was the
right thing to do.

40:44.675 --> 40:46.677
You didn't
listen, corbin.

40:51.081 --> 40:55.085
If anything had
happened to joshua...

40:55.120 --> 40:58.289
believe me, lisa.

41:03.894 --> 41:06.297
I'm so sorry.

41:15.506 --> 41:16.307
Where's josh?

41:16.707 --> 41:18.309
He's here.

41:23.514 --> 41:27.117
If you ask me, i can't
believe she's taking him back.

41:27.518 --> 41:30.721
If you ask me, i'd say the
valentines have got a lot of

41:30.756 --> 41:32.688
issues before
they're home free.

41:32.723 --> 41:35.125
Yeah, but that's what
relationships are all about,

41:35.160 --> 41:36.327
confronting challenges
every day, right?

41:36.727 --> 41:39.129
Well, if anything good
has come out of all this,

41:39.164 --> 41:41.897
we've got corbin
valentine on our side.

41:41.932 --> 41:44.735
Yeah, and the gsa gets
to keep miss wendy stone.

41:44.770 --> 41:48.339
Hmm. I'd say
we came out ahead.

41:48.739 --> 41:52.343
Plus, corbin
gets a chance to be a real
hero to lisa and josh, huh?

41:52.378 --> 41:53.909
Guess so.

41:53.944 --> 41:55.946
I'd say we won.
