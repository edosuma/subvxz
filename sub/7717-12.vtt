WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:02.301
- Gotta clear out
this cabinet, people.

00:02.303 --> 00:05.204
A lot of these
are dead accounts.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.139
"scranton mimeograph corp"?

00:07.141 --> 00:09.041
I don't think we're doing
business with them anytime soon.

00:09.043 --> 00:11.543
That's odd.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.313
A letter
from robert dunder.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.248
"a valuable artifact
has come into my possession.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.751
"I have hidden it
until such time as a person

00:18.753 --> 00:22.221
"of strong intellect
may safely recover it.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.423
"this golden chalice is
of immeasurable historical

00:24.425 --> 00:28.394
And religious significance."

00:28.396 --> 00:30.396
The holy grail.

00:30.398 --> 00:33.065
- Did you send dwight
on a quest for the holy grail?

00:33.067 --> 00:36.235
- I think I'm a little too busy
these days to s--

00:36.237 --> 00:38.504
Oh, my god.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.507
I did send dwight
on a quest for the holy grail.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.342
The dunder code!

00:43.344 --> 00:46.311
I completely forgot
about that prank.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.514
That had to be, like,
six or seven years ago.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.649
Stayed late every night
for a month.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.152
Had a lot more free time
back then.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.286
- I don't get it.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.287
- Aha!

00:55.289 --> 00:57.189
A lightbulb.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.757
- Lightbul--
- a lightbulb!

00:58.759 --> 01:01.260
Okay. Okay.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.829
Invisible ink.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.531
- Whoa.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.333
- "higher than numbers go."

01:08.335 --> 01:09.802
The ceiling
above accounting!

01:09.804 --> 01:11.737
- Dwight!
Down, dwight!

01:11.739 --> 01:15.808
- Man, I wish I was there to see
his face when he gets to the end

01:15.810 --> 01:19.278
And finds the...Fake grail?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.080
No grail?

01:21.082 --> 01:22.181
- You don't remember?

01:22.183 --> 01:23.215
- I don't.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.184
- An "x."

01:25.186 --> 01:26.452
- Annex.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.287
It must open something
in the annex.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.255
- [gasps]
- oh.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.158
- Whoa.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.261
- <i>"sedes introiti."</i>

01:36.263 --> 01:38.263
Seat of entrance.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.466
[shouts]

01:42.302 --> 01:44.203
- [gasps]

01:44.205 --> 01:45.637
- What?
- What?

01:45.639 --> 01:47.239
- That's a flush.

01:47.241 --> 01:51.176
[all murmuring]

01:51.178 --> 01:53.579
All:
The warehouse.

01:58.751 --> 02:01.153
- There's nothing
down here.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.155
- Oh, I expected more
from young halpert.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.757
- Let's just forget it.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.393
Forget it.

02:11.764 --> 02:14.766
[cheerful music]

02:14.768 --> 02:21.173
â™ª

02:21.175 --> 02:23.308
- So how
are we getting on

02:23.310 --> 02:26.812
With our grand
social media initiative?

02:26.814 --> 02:30.315
- Well, we created a fake
profile for a really cool guy

02:30.317 --> 02:32.251
Named derek mcblack.
- Wow.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.753
- It's just pete in sunglasses.
- Oh.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.356
- And then we had him
"like" dunder mifflin.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.192
- Then we created a bunch
of fake friends for derek,

02:40.194 --> 02:42.761
And we had all of them
"like" derek's "likes."

02:42.763 --> 02:45.364
- So far, we're only popular
with imaginary people,

02:45.366 --> 02:48.300
But we think this is
the start of something big.

02:48.302 --> 02:52.404
And I am a genius
putting you two together.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.472
- All right.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.207
- Pete and I
work well together--

02:55.209 --> 02:57.442
Not that there's anything
special about pete.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.912
It could be any guy...
Or girl--

02:59.914 --> 03:01.413
Not that I'm into girls.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.447
Not that I'm into pete.

03:02.449 --> 03:03.815
Ugh, what was the question?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.417
[indistinct chatter]

03:05.419 --> 03:08.187
Peter rowley
at bridgeport capital

03:08.189 --> 03:10.422
Requested a meeting at lunch.
- Okay.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.257
Can we keep it
on the early side, though?

03:12.259 --> 03:13.559
I got that thing
in scranton later.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.294
- Oh, sure.
- No problem.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.462
- Cece's ballet recital
is today.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.264
I cannot wait.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.666
I've been working
with her on her move.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.201
It's called
the cece spin and kiss.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.304
Do you want to see it?
It's kind of like this.

03:27.273 --> 03:30.809
It's pretty cute, right?

03:30.811 --> 03:34.279
- Pfft, "athlead"?

03:34.281 --> 03:35.614
Please.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.483
They're too lazy
to call it athletes lead?

03:38.485 --> 03:41.353
Jim should
just call it "stumpany,"

03:41.355 --> 03:43.555
For "stupid company."

03:43.557 --> 03:44.923
- Nothing stupid
about working for yourself,

03:44.925 --> 03:46.625
Hanging out
with pro athletes,

03:46.627 --> 03:47.859
Getting free tickets
to the games.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.261
That's why I'm doing it.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.996
- You're working
for "stumpany" too?

03:50.998 --> 03:52.297
- Yeah, just weekends for now,

03:52.299 --> 03:53.332
But pretty soon
I'm switching over.

03:53.334 --> 03:56.368
- What?
- Yep.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.869
- Hey, halpert,
what's the big idea?

03:57.871 --> 03:59.938
First you jump ship.
Now you're stealing darryl too.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.240
When will it end?

04:01.242 --> 04:02.608
- Well,
take your worst fear

04:02.610 --> 04:04.243
And multiply it
by infinity.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.446
- You won't stop
until you've poached us all.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.715
- Yeah. Even you.
- No.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.351
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let us lose me.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.753
- Bye, dwight.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.023
How are you? Good to see you.
- Thank you.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.259
- Hey, angela?

04:20.261 --> 04:22.928
About the irish-american
cultural center mural?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.997
- Ooh, I haven't heard it.

04:24.999 --> 04:28.367
So what about the irish-american
cultural center mural?

04:28.369 --> 04:29.801
Potato?

04:29.803 --> 04:31.970
- Oh, no, kevin,
it's not a joke.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.607
Angela's husband put me up
for a--um, just never mind.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.742
- I have no information.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.277
But I'm sure
as soon as they know,

04:38.279 --> 04:39.811
They'll call you.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.446
- Senator lipton
helped me submit my design

04:41.448 --> 04:43.482
For a new mural
on a building downtown.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.817
Now I'm just waiting to hear
from the selection committee.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.819
But, you know,
let's be realistic.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.321
There are a ton
of great artists in scranton

04:49.323 --> 04:51.456
With way more experience.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.058
I mean, who are they
gonna go with--

04:53.060 --> 04:57.029
Some nobody like me
or a big name like tracy fleeb?

04:57.031 --> 05:00.365
Well, I'm heading out
to cece's dance recital.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.468
- Aw.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.804
- Hey, cece, daddy's gonna
have dinner with us tonight

05:05.806 --> 05:07.072
After he comes
to your recital.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.007
Are you excited?
- Yeah.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.709
- Let's call him.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.712
[line trilling]

05:13.714 --> 05:16.415
- Hey.
I was just about to call you.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.317
- Hey, hon,
are you close?

05:18.319 --> 05:20.619
- I am still
in philly, actually.

05:20.621 --> 05:21.987
- What?
- It's insane.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.056
This huge investor
got cold feet,

05:24.058 --> 05:26.091
So I'm stuck here
trying to keep him on board.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.727
- Hon, I wish you would
have told me an hour ago,

05:28.729 --> 05:30.095
When you knew
you weren't gonna make it.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.699
I barely made it out
just to make this phone call.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.735
- I want daddy.
- You're gonna do great.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.003
And you know what?
Mommy's gonna record it.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.571
So we'll watch it together.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.640
Do you mind doing that, pam?
- Of course.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.810
- Okay. Are you sure you know
how to do video on the phone?

05:44.812 --> 05:46.678
- Yes, jim,
I think I know

05:46.680 --> 05:48.814
How to point a rectangle
at something.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.382
- Okay, okay, you know,
just sometimes

05:50.384 --> 05:51.783
You're not the best
with the phone.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.485
- I know how to operate
my phone, okay?

05:53.487 --> 05:54.853
Listen,
we're getting close.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.621
We will talk to you later.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.056
Say, "bye, daddy."

05:58.058 --> 06:00.959
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.995
Yep. See, you still
got to press "end," pam.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.798
- Press "end."

06:06.800 --> 06:09.000
- Oh, check it out.
This is our first real "like."

06:09.002 --> 06:12.104
- All right, alan olifson
from north dakota.

06:12.106 --> 06:15.440
He also likes hammermill
and georgia pacific.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.942
- Wow. That guy's
really into paper.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.711
- Yeah.
- Well done, you two.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.114
Youth task force forever.
- Yes.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.949
Bup, bup, bup, bap.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.650
And then--oh, wait.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.419
- No, you go--
- did I--is that you?

06:27.421 --> 06:28.820
- You go first,
and then it's a left turn.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.489
- No, you go--okay.
All right, all right.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.624
Okay, start over.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.794
Oh, god. Andy has just
started to be nice to me,

06:35.796 --> 06:38.530
And now I've sent his girlfriend
into the arms of a younger man.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.867
And I cc'd him
on every incriminating memo.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.136
"pete and erin,
don't hold back.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.905
"our social media presence
should be hot, hot, hot.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.909
I did everything
but unzip their pants for them.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.012
Oh, god, nellie.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.547
- Hey, everybody.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.083
Uh, coffee order
is going around--on me.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.118
Just sign your name below.
[all murmur]

07:00.120 --> 07:04.189
This says "dunder mifflin
loyalty pledge"?

07:04.191 --> 07:06.525
- This--uh, what?
Double mocha latte, please?

07:06.527 --> 07:07.926
You got it.
Just sign your name below.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.195
Whatever you want.
- "loyalty pledge"?

07:10.197 --> 07:11.830
- Come on, dwight,
stop overreacting.

07:11.832 --> 07:15.834
No customers have complained.
Nobody even knows.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.970
- Yeah,
we'll see about that.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.505
Bust out
your complaint files.

07:20.507 --> 07:21.973
I need everything
you got on darryl

07:21.975 --> 07:23.975
Since he started working
for jim in the last few weeks.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.178
Break it down by keyword,
okay?

07:26.180 --> 07:28.213
"infuriating,
irresponsible"...

07:28.215 --> 07:30.048
- They got us set up
with windows 95,

07:30.050 --> 07:32.451
So you're
kind of dreaming here.

07:32.453 --> 07:36.588
- Okay, I'm gonna need you
to print it out.

07:39.025 --> 07:42.661
[printer beeping]

07:42.663 --> 07:48.767
[printer whirring loudly]

07:51.838 --> 07:54.573
- "customer loyalty."

07:54.575 --> 07:56.575
What is it?

07:56.577 --> 07:58.610
Can you hold it
in your hand?

07:58.612 --> 08:00.512
Can you nudge it
with your finger?

08:00.514 --> 08:02.147
Can you dump it
on a woman?

08:02.149 --> 08:03.148
No.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.083
Why?
Because it's an idea.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.152
But what does it mean?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.187
- Ooh, it's when you
get a free sandwich

08:09.189 --> 08:12.224
After you've already eaten
ten sandwiches.

08:12.226 --> 08:16.261
Mr. Romanko has been
a client for 20 years.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.163
He came in today
in a rage.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.931
Why?
Because of darryl.

08:19.933 --> 08:24.269
Because darryl was focusing
on outside projects

08:24.271 --> 08:27.572
And needs to remember
his first priority--

08:27.574 --> 08:29.107
The client.

08:29.109 --> 08:33.245
- Mr. Romanko, we were a day
late on one of your deliveries,

08:33.247 --> 08:35.247
But two of our trucks
were down for repairs.

08:35.249 --> 08:36.815
It's very unlikely
it would happen again.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.650
- Thank you.
Thank you.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.785
- No, you're not going
anywhere, okay?

08:40.787 --> 08:44.256
You are angry, and we are gonna
hear you out, all right?

08:44.258 --> 08:46.558
Because business
is about relationships,

08:46.560 --> 08:50.262
And the key to relationships
is what, darryl?

08:50.264 --> 08:51.263
L--

08:51.265 --> 08:52.998
- Loyalty.
- Loyalty.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.534
- Loyalty is exactly right.
- Thank you.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.602
- Yes.
I mean, it is everything.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.170
Let's all ask ourselves,

08:59.172 --> 09:02.240
Have we been faithful
in our relationships?

09:02.242 --> 09:03.842
- That's none
of your damn business.

09:03.844 --> 09:08.313
- Darryl is "dating"
dunder mifflin.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.915
- Darryl is dating val...

09:09.917 --> 09:11.316
Still.

09:11.318 --> 09:14.119
- But he's flirting

09:14.121 --> 09:16.955
With jim's company
on the side.

09:16.957 --> 09:20.292
And we all know
what flirting can lead to.

09:20.294 --> 09:21.593
- I'm sorry.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.794
Do I still need to be here?
- Yes.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.729
- I'm still having
a bit of trouble

09:24.731 --> 09:27.299
Understanding
the importance of loyalty.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.200
So let's--
let's use an example.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.835
Take erin.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.972
Erin's boyfriend, andy,
is away across the ocean.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.141
- Yeah.
- So is it all right

09:36.143 --> 09:39.811
For her to flirt
with creed, for example?

09:39.813 --> 09:41.212
- Let's try it out.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.214
- No, let's--let's--
let's not say creed.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.816
Let's say mr. "x."

09:44.818 --> 09:46.184
- Well, I think
it would be immoral

09:46.186 --> 09:47.986
For erin to cheat
on andy.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.988
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't you cheat on andy?

09:49.990 --> 09:52.223
- Yes.
And he didn't like it.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.926
- Does mr. "x" know
that erin has a boyfriend,

09:54.928 --> 09:58.330
Or did erin keep that
from mr. "x"?

09:58.332 --> 10:00.932
- Okay,
this is really hard to follow.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.233
Can we just say pete

10:02.235 --> 10:04.202
Because that's the guy
that erin's flirting with?

10:04.204 --> 10:06.972
- [clears throat]

10:09.175 --> 10:15.146
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the little ladybug ballerinas.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.149
<i>[twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>
<i>plays]</i>

10:18.151 --> 10:20.085
â™ª

10:20.087 --> 10:21.987
All:
One, two, three.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.922
[cell phone ringing]

10:23.924 --> 10:25.156
- Really?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.758
- Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.927
Ballerinas:
One, two, three.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.929
- [whispering]
hello?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.330
Yes, this is pam halpert.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.398
I got the mural?
Oh, my god!

10:33.400 --> 10:35.100
All:
Shh!

10:35.102 --> 10:37.302
- [whispering]
um, I'm sorry. I have to go.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.104
My daughter's a ladybug.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.772
I know that doesn't make
any sense.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.707
Um, thank you,
thank you.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.175
- You're very rude.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.144
- Yes, very rude.
- Shh!

10:46.146 --> 10:48.980
Kids are dancing.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.652
- Thank you so much
for coming.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.321
Darryl and I will be here
to serve you for years

10:56.323 --> 11:00.692
And years and years
and years.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.094
[chuckles]
so should we go call jim

11:03.096 --> 11:04.963
And go tell him
to go screw himself?

11:04.965 --> 11:08.733
I'm sorry you're having
a hard time with this, okay?

11:08.735 --> 11:11.102
Athlead is my future.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.837
No disrespect
to dunder mifflin,

11:12.839 --> 11:15.073
But if I can have fun at work,
I want that.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.241
- It can't be more fun

11:16.243 --> 11:17.742
Than selling paper
and paper products.

11:17.744 --> 11:18.877
- It can.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.713
- Are you pretending
to be crazy, huh?

11:21.715 --> 11:24.249
- Well, andy's cute,
but he's too vanilla,

11:24.251 --> 11:26.117
Whereas pete--
he's just one sick dude.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.353
I mean, you know this guy
likes to get weird.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.188
- I'm just gonna say this
one more time.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.323
Pete and I
haven't done anything.

11:32.325 --> 11:36.361
With slammin' bods like that,
they ain't playing checkers.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.929
- People, it's 2013.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.331
Erin is a strong,
independent woman.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.334
Who says she has to end up
with any man?

11:45.237 --> 11:48.206
- Okay, can everyone
please stop speaking for me?

11:48.208 --> 11:51.309
Andy is my boyfriend.
Pete and I are just friends.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.911
And that's the end of it.
Right, pete?

11:52.913 --> 11:54.312
- That is correct.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.215
Come on, guys,
where is this even coming from?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.050
- Your feelings for erin?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.119
Probably your heart...

12:01.121 --> 12:02.921
And a little bit
your penis.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.889
[all groan]

12:04.891 --> 12:07.092
- Nellie, you have to shut down
youth task force.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.261
To start a new task force
to do that,

12:10.263 --> 12:11.930
But please
just do whatever it takes.

12:11.932 --> 12:16.367
- I suppose that will--
that will be all right, yeah.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.237
Most relationships
eventually die on their own,

12:19.239 --> 12:22.741
But sometimes they just need
a little pillow over the face.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.876
You're welcome, andy.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.345
And you're welcome,
my own ass.

12:27.347 --> 12:31.216
- Listen, I appreciate you
taking the time with me.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.252
We completely understand
your concerns here.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.020
Let us just show you
the latest projections.

12:36.022 --> 12:40.325
But he's gonna be calling in
with those numbers any second.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.360
So just hold on one s--
[cell phone vibrates]

12:42.362 --> 12:43.862
Oh, actually...

12:43.864 --> 12:47.932
Uh, nope.
That is my wife.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.068
Again, he'll be calling
in any second.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.470
- Hey, uh, give me a call back
when you get a chance.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.907
Cece did great, and I want
to tell you something.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.243
- Hey, boss, you gotta jump
on a delivery.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.079
- I don't do that anymore.
- That's what they told me.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.382
- [sighs]

13:05.985 --> 13:07.485
All right,
let's get this over with.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.787
- You looking for fun?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.255
It just found you!

13:10.257 --> 13:12.791
Whoo!
[laughs]

13:12.793 --> 13:14.125
[engine turning]

13:14.127 --> 13:16.461
Here we go!
Yeah!

13:18.998 --> 13:20.932
- Yes, we will be delivering
a shipment of paper today,

13:20.934 --> 13:26.504
But I will also be delivering
you a big shipment of fun.!

13:26.506 --> 13:29.808
[fun.'s <i>we are young</i> plays]
- â™ª tonight

13:29.810 --> 13:31.476
- How far is this place?
[turns off radio]

13:31.478 --> 13:34.112
- Uh, not far at all,

13:34.114 --> 13:38.116
But I thought along the way,
we could play some sports.

13:39.553 --> 13:43.955
- Hey, really nice job
in that meeting in there.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.089
- Oh, thank you.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.491
I don't know.
I sort of thought I--

13:46.493 --> 13:48.359
- So proud of you, hon.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.828
- Oh, I don't know.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.062
Okay.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.297
- I'm just curious, though--

13:52.299 --> 13:55.934
- Well, andy wrote me a really
nice recommendation letter

13:55.936 --> 13:57.535
For the adoption agency,

13:57.537 --> 13:59.604
And I-I just sort of felt
I owed him one.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.306
- Pete's a pretty cool guy,
though,

14:01.308 --> 14:05.176
And andy was
a terrible lover to erin.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.913
He basically ignored her
and left on a boat.

14:08.915 --> 14:11.182
- I didn't really think
about it like that.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.517
- Yeah, well...

14:12.519 --> 14:17.355
Not everybody has
what we have.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.958
- "what we have"?
- Mm-hmm.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.894
- I just remembered...

14:22.896 --> 14:25.063
I kissed that man.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.201
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.238
- Yes.
Fast food.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.908
I'll take a burger over a gross
philly cheesesteak any day.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.276
- They have fast food
in philly.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.945
- Not like this.
- Exactly like this.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.380
- And your milkshake.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.048
- Thank you.
- It's 30 degrees out.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.917
You're drinking a milkshake?

14:45.919 --> 14:47.318
- Nope.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.053
Fire in the hole!

14:49.055 --> 14:51.256
[laughs]
oh, yeah!

14:51.258 --> 14:54.392
Now, that's what working
at a paper company's all about!

14:54.394 --> 14:55.627
[keys jingle]
wait. What are you doing?

14:55.629 --> 14:57.028
No, I need the k--
we have to go.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.296
- You just threw a milkshake

14:58.298 --> 14:59.964
In a restaurant
where they make minimum wage.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.934
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, they're coming.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.169
- Anyone want to see the video
from cece's recital?

15:05.171 --> 15:06.905
- Oh, I would love to,

15:06.907 --> 15:09.574
But I am swamped...

15:09.576 --> 15:11.042
With that.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.076
- I'll watch it.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.445
Let's get this over with.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.114
- All right,
you don't have to.

15:16.116 --> 15:19.117
- Let's get this
over with, pam.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.251
- Okay.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.254
[applause]

15:23.256 --> 15:25.123
- Oh.
- Wait. What?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.425
I'm in a rush
to get back to work.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.227
Oh, no.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.963
I took a phone call
in the middle of taping,

15:31.965 --> 15:33.665
And then when I went
to turn it back on,

15:33.667 --> 15:35.033
I must have turned it off.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.535
I heard it happened
to other people.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.471
I'm sure pam is already
kicking herself

15:40.473 --> 15:42.974
For choosing a phone call
over her child.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.276
- Well, it was
an important phone call.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.979
I haven't told anyone here
about the mural yet.

15:47.981 --> 15:51.082
I want jim to be
the first to know.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.084
Whenever I tell him
good news,

15:53.086 --> 15:56.087
He's always like, "beesly!"

15:56.089 --> 15:57.455
I love that.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.557
Only thing better
than getting the job--

15:59.559 --> 16:01.693
"beesly!"
[chuckles]

16:06.532 --> 16:09.100
- Hey.
- Hello, peter.

16:14.306 --> 16:20.411
[copier whirring]

16:21.680 --> 16:25.683
- It barely even feels
like a prank anymore.

16:25.685 --> 16:26.985
- You missed a spot.

16:26.987 --> 16:30.254
- Go, go, go, go!
[tires screech]

16:30.256 --> 16:31.756
- Ha ha!

16:31.758 --> 16:34.158
Yeah, joke's on you, buddy!

16:34.160 --> 16:37.996
They make you come back
and clean it up!

16:37.998 --> 16:39.764
- I am sorry that
that was so awkward

16:39.766 --> 16:45.069
But I am going to have to
reassemble the youth task force.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.338
- Oh, no, I really don't think
that's a good idea.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.141
- Well, that is not your call.
I made the decision.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.176
You have no choice
in the matter,

16:52.178 --> 16:55.279
And everybody knows it.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.515
- Well, okay, then.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.050
- I guess we don't have
a choice.

16:59.052 --> 16:59.784
- Nope.

16:59.786 --> 17:04.055
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.300
- Lady...

17:19.671 --> 17:22.807
You never stop
surprising me.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.378
- [sighs]

17:27.380 --> 17:29.514
[clears throat]

17:29.516 --> 17:32.417
- What?
What was that?

17:32.419 --> 17:35.520
Did I just hear you
laughing with glee?

17:35.522 --> 17:36.621
- No.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.123
I was clearing my throat.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.292
- [sighs]

17:41.294 --> 17:44.328
- Good night.
- Night.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.498
- Night.
- Night, creed.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.706
[cell phone rings]

17:55.708 --> 17:58.810
Hey.
- Hey.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.144
- So how's it going?

18:00.146 --> 18:02.413
- We lost
bridgeport capital.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.148
I have no idea
what happened.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.117
It's like everything I did,
he just wouldn't go for it.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.618
- I'm so sorry.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.787
- I have no idea where we're
gonna come up with this money,

18:09.789 --> 18:12.523
And we have to work insanely
hard over the next few weeks.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.225
- Oh.
I'm sorry.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.561
I feel like you've already
been working insanely hard.

18:16.563 --> 18:20.131
- Can you figure out how
to upload cece's dance recital?

18:20.133 --> 18:23.768
I definitely could use
a pick-me-up.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.837
- Um, actually, funny story--
I didn't get it.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.538
I shouldn't have been
so cocky

18:27.540 --> 18:29.207
About my rectangle-holding
skills after all.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.375
- You're not serious,
are you?

18:31.377 --> 18:34.112
You didn't get
any of the recital?

18:34.114 --> 18:36.214
- No, I got
the teacher introducing them

18:36.216 --> 18:37.849
And then
the applause afterwards.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.317
But not so much
of the middle part.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.885
- Come on, pam.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.287
Pam, I asked you
if you could use the phone,

18:43.289 --> 18:45.156
And you swore
that you knew how.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.624
- Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.227
I'm sure we can get a copy.
A lot of people were taping it.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.795
- Oh, great.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.864
So we'll see somebody else's kid
with cece in the background?

18:52.866 --> 18:55.867
I mean, it's really not
that hard to film a video.

18:55.869 --> 18:57.902
- Is there--um...

18:57.904 --> 19:00.271
You want to ease up
a little bit?

19:00.273 --> 19:01.873
- Look, pam, I don't know
what to tell you.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.275
I mean, what do I do?
It's gone.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.910
That moment's just gone.
I missed it.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.446
- I don't know, jim--maybe you
should have been there.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.448
- You're not serious,
right?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.517
I mean,
how is that fair?

19:12.519 --> 19:14.752
I'm in philly.
These are my days in philly.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.154
You've agreed to this.

19:16.156 --> 19:20.525
A conversation with me
about what's fair, okay?

19:20.527 --> 19:23.794
This is way more intense
than I ever--

19:23.796 --> 19:24.829
- Pam, I'm not explaining
this to you--

19:24.831 --> 19:26.430
Pam, I'm not going
over this again.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.499
I don't know how else--
- jim, we--we need you.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.934
- I don't know how else
to tell you, okay?

19:29.936 --> 19:32.737
I'm doing everything
I can every week

19:32.739 --> 19:34.472
To bring home something...
- I am--I am--

19:34.474 --> 19:35.873
- For our fam--
- I am trying to make everything

19:35.875 --> 19:39.877
So that you can have
everything that you want.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.479
- I'm doing this
just for me?

19:41.481 --> 19:43.481
Is that what I'm doing?
I'm doing it just for me.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.784
If that's what you think,
then this is a really sad night.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.886
But you know what?
I got to go.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.622
Okay?
- Yep.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.925
- We'll talk tomorrow?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.827
- Yep.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.563
- All right.
Great.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.264
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.367
- Bye.

20:13.478 --> 20:16.814
[sniffles, cries]

20:16.816 --> 20:19.850
- Hey, you okay?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.821
- What am I doing wrong,
brian?

20:23.823 --> 20:25.556
- Nothing.
You're doing the best you can.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.791
- Brian.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.894
- Give her a minute.
Give her a minute.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.431
- [crying]

20:33.433 --> 20:36.834
- Hey, it's just
a tough situation, all right?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.869
- It's getting tougher.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.473
I just didn't know
that it was gonna be this hard.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.909
- Yeah.
Let's turn the cameras off.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.244
Seriously, guys.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.713
Enough.
Enough.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.749
- Thank you.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.019
- Fire in the hole!

20:55.021 --> 20:56.754
- [screams]

20:56.756 --> 20:58.589
- Go, go, go, go!

20:58.591 --> 21:01.926
[laughter]

21:01.928 --> 21:04.495
- I nailed that guy, dude.
- Oh, yeah.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.931
- And replay.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.666
- Thank you.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.936
Fire in the hole!
- [screams]

21:11.938 --> 21:13.671
- Go, go, go, go!
[laughter]

21:13.673 --> 21:15.706
- I nailed that guy, dude.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.942
- [sighs]

21:17.944 --> 21:21.045
I'm gonna miss
the paper business.
