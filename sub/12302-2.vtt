00:17.810 --> 00:23.740
Ladies, what's going on? Y'all are looking
real good. That's one of ours, right?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.610
Oh, look who's here.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.180
How are you, hey.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.050
Man, wait, wait, wait!

00:34.180 --> 00:35.780
Slow down, man!
This a no-wake zone!

00:35.790 --> 00:38.130
Come on, what's wrong?
Are you crazy? Slow down!

00:38.180 --> 00:40.020
It's a no-wake zone!
Slow down!

00:40.060 --> 00:42.010
You gonna hurt somebody
one of these days.

00:42.380 --> 00:43.830
Idiots, man.

00:43.830 --> 00:46.430
Can't have nothing nice these days.
You know what I'm saying?

00:50.830 --> 00:53.860
Oye, Stevie. Not too close to the water,
okay, Honey?

00:53.860 --> 00:55.730
All right, Mom.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.910
More champagne?

00:58.980 --> 01:01.280
It's a party, man.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.380
Stevie!

01:19.630 --> 01:21.750
Yo, is anybody a'ight?

01:35.530 --> 01:38.250
Mommy

01:49.720 --> 01:52.280
- Horatio?
- Yeah?

01:53.400 --> 01:56.420
The name of our vic is
Jennifer Valdez, 26.

01:56.470 --> 02:02.790
She was a guest of the owner of the house,
a Dennis De Labeque, a. k.a. "Deuce Deuce. "

02:02.880 --> 02:04.910
Awful lot of guests at
this party, Frank.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.190
Well. Mr. De Labeque is
an entrepreneur.

02:07.220 --> 02:11.440
He got famous producing partie in South
Beach for movie stars and pro athletes.

02:11.450 --> 02:14.480
He was hosting his own party today
to launch his new fashion line.

02:14.530 --> 02:18.130
- Anyone see anything?
- Uh, yeah. Possibly two suspects.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.850
A driver and a shooter, but you know
how that goes, everybody runs for cover.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.120
So, no hard IDs.
What about the owner?

02:24.190 --> 02:28.960
Well, Mr. De Labeque is only saying that the gunfire
came from the bayside from a passing cigarette boat.

02:28.970 --> 02:31.710
Okay, but that's a whole lot of
gunfire to kill one woman though.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.770
Well, it's unlikely our
victim was the target.

02:33.850 --> 02:35.240
Not from that distance either.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.990
So that means the shooter was aiming at
the whole party, and not the individual.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.220
Which basically means
we've got a drive-by.

02:41.290 --> 02:43.380
A drive-by... Miami style.

02:43.710 --> 02:48.710
The Miami's Sub Team presente

02:48.790 --> 02:53.780
CSI Miami Saison 3 Episode 02:

Synchro: Chekdatas, Percy, Snake et Space67

03:36.650 --> 03:40.350
Looks like she was killed
by a single gunshot.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.980
Got an exit wound.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.360
Sporadic is right.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.520
Guy didn't care who he hit.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.240
Stevie!

04:09.070 --> 04:12.500
Well He's going to care.
He bought himself a murder charge.

04:12.530 --> 04:15.060
All right, I'm going to go find
that through-and-through.

04:15.150 --> 04:16.380
Amen.

04:18.610 --> 04:20.740
Mr. De Labeque,
do you have y enemies?

04:20.839 --> 04:22.270
Make a list.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.900
Lot of haters out there, they don't
like to see a brother that's doing good.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.550
Any of these "haters"
ever threaten you?

04:26.590 --> 04:28.230
Come on, man, I stay in
the positive, a'ight.

04:28.250 --> 04:32.690
Unfortunately, Jennifer Valdez doesn't
have that luxury anymore, does she?

04:34.690 --> 04:36.000
You know what's killing me about Jennifer?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.180
What's that?

04:37.180 --> 04:40.320
- - It's that she got
dealt a bad hand. -

04:40.320 --> 04:42.220
But now it all
falls on Stevie.

04:42.220 --> 04:43.920
Who is Stevie?

04:43.950 --> 04:46.160
It's her little shorty, man.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.950
Excuse me, gentlemen.

04:59.070 --> 05:04.820
Stevie, my name's Horatio Caine
and I was wondering

05:05.180 --> 05:07.210
How you're doing?

05:08.820 --> 05:10.570
Okay. All righty.

05:10.570 --> 05:15.970
Um, I want to get you a ride home, but I don't
know if you have a relative in the area, do you?

05:18.210 --> 05:20.280
All right, I'll work on that.

05:20.390 --> 05:25.800
Did you, Stevie, see the man
who did the shooting?

05:27.420 --> 05:28.750
No?

05:28.970 --> 05:31.820
Okay, all right, partner.

05:31.820 --> 05:34.470
I'll, um, I'll go see about
that ride, okay?

05:36.060 --> 05:37.950
He had a black gun.

05:41.320 --> 05:46.220
Stevie? Do you think you could come
with me and take a look at some pictures?

05:47.200 --> 05:49.670
Will they put the siren on?

05:49.670 --> 05:51.240
You want the siren?

05:52.010 --> 05:57.010
Okay, I'm going to tell them
that Stevie wants the siren.

05:57.010 --> 05:58.530
- All right.
- Okay, pal.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.310
- H.
- Yeah?

06:00.330 --> 06:04.840
Coast Guard just spotted our cigarette boat headed
out towards open water just past Key Biscayne.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.740
Okay, get Frank and go.

06:32.150 --> 06:36.700
Vessel off our port bow. Heave
to and be prepared to be boarded.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.900
Why you coming at
me all hard for, man? Hu?
wierd i don' know

06:49.900 --> 06:51.830
Like I'm a criminal or
something, dawg.

06:51.830 --> 06:56.580
Aside from the fact that you have no registration for that
boat, it was involved in a shooting over by Star Island today.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.670
What? Man, I ain't blast nobody.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.930
Driving a boat that was
used in a murder?

07:01.580 --> 07:03.820
Doesn't make much difference if you
pulled the trigger or not, does it?

07:03.820 --> 07:05.940
I found that boat, like,
a half hour ago, man.

07:06.450 --> 07:08.630
It was sitting there running.
I took it for a ride.

07:08.870 --> 07:10.180
Where was it just sitting?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.100
I ain't going to do your
job for no One Time.

07:12.690 --> 07:13.870
All right.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.730
Suit yourself, Eight Mile.
Turn arround.

07:18.240 --> 07:18.720
Whatever, man.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.100
Officer.

07:28.150 --> 07:29.360
He'll give it up eventually.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.730
Doesn't really matter.
We've got his boat.

07:38.310 --> 07:40.590
I thought I was going to look
at pictures of a gun.

07:41.080 --> 07:45.970
Well, you know, sometimes, Stevie,
when somebody is very scared,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.180
all they see is the gun.

07:52.570 --> 07:57.010
But if they think really hard,
they can see the face behind the gun.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.200
I shouldn't have been
so close to the water.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.160
Stevie.

08:05.010 --> 08:08.390
This is not your fault.
That's not why this happened.

08:09.250 --> 08:09.620
You get that?

08:11.250 --> 08:11.680
Okay.

08:12.140 --> 08:14.640
You continue to look at the pictures.
I'll be back.

09:06.230 --> 09:08.520
Hey, Delko? Get anything?

09:09.510 --> 09:11.640
Couple of partials. Might
give us one of our suspects.

09:12.230 --> 09:13.290
Somebody was getting busy.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.260
Must be 30 cartridges
down there.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.670
Yeah, it's all nine mil.

09:17.070 --> 09:18.650
Guy thought he was
Tony Montana.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.910
There's no gun on board, so I'm thinking
he dumped it somewhere in the Bay.

09:27.450 --> 09:28.440
Hey, Delko, take a look at this.

09:31.740 --> 09:33.530
Two bullet strikes
on the outside.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.310
Maybe someone
from the party.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.800
House full of urbanites, you know,
probably all packing.

09:41.200 --> 09:41.920
What, am I wrong?

09:42.780 --> 09:44.250
Easy, big fella, all right?

09:44.280 --> 09:46.470
Well, somebody tooka couple
pops at this boat.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.990
It's got to be somebody
from the party.

09:54.230 --> 09:57.550
Well, the question is, were
they returning fire,or initiating it?

09:59.210 --> 10:00.690
Hold on a second, man.

10:00.740 --> 10:04.150
So wait, I get shot at,
but yet I'm treated ike a suspect?

10:08.190 --> 10:11.680
Someone from your party,
Dennis, shot at the boat.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.540
Lieutenant.

10:20.570 --> 10:21.630
That is gun shot residue.

10:22.190 --> 10:25.110
Who, Dennis, were you shooting at?

10:27.240 --> 10:28.530
I was defending myself.

10:28.530 --> 10:30.430
- So they shot first?
- Of course they shot first.

10:30.860 --> 10:33.810
But if a punk busts off on me, you
better believe I'm going to bust back.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.870
Dennis, you're holding
out on me.

10:49.260 --> 10:51.550
You know who did the drive-by,
don't you?

10:52.420 --> 10:54.090
Look, man, I handle my own
business, all right?

10:54.390 --> 10:56.370
Our victim just made
this my business.

10:56.650 --> 10:59.490
If I get caught up in a murder trial,
that means I got to testify.

10:59.830 --> 11:01.880
I got a clothing line now.
I got housewares.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.470
You don't see Calvin Klein
caught up in no Star Island murder.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.550
It's bad for business, man.

11:06.550 --> 11:10.060
I suggest that you start thinking
about what's best for this little boy.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.090
So who am I looking for?

11:19.620 --> 11:21.640
He's an old partner of mine
from back in the day.

11:22.650 --> 11:25.980
We used to produce parties and stuff
together, you know, trying to out-puff Puffy.

11:25.980 --> 11:27.020
What's his name?

11:27.140 --> 11:28.330
Byron Middlebrook.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.440
Calls himself "B. Slick. "

11:31.220 --> 11:35.190
I need B. Slick's address,
and I need your gun.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.080
Stevie?

12:07.780 --> 12:08.780
It's him.

12:10.220 --> 12:12.080
Are you okay, partner?

12:13.610 --> 12:14.620
Yes.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.540
Are you sure?

12:18.860 --> 12:19.900
Stevie...

12:28.580 --> 12:29.790
I'm sorry.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.780
There's no need to apologize.

12:31.780 --> 12:33.410
Is he going to get me, too?

12:33.410 --> 12:40.500
Stevie, he is never going to
hurt you again. Okay?

12:41.370 --> 12:42.600
All right.

12:42.610 --> 12:44.040
That's Detective Salas.

12:44.040 --> 12:47.150
You're going to go with her and get
cleaned up, and I'll talk to you later.

12:47.470 --> 12:48.750
- Okay.
- All right

12:52.840 --> 12:54.100
He can make an ID?

12:54.740 --> 13:00.360
Yes, but I'd like to keep it between you and
I for the time being, if you don't mind. Okay?

13:00.360 --> 13:01.970
- All right.
- I'll be back partner.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.510
Hey.

13:08.170 --> 13:10.620
- The boat thief?
- Vanilla Ice?

13:10.620 --> 13:13.420
Threatened to throw his ass in
a holding tank with real gangsters.

13:13.420 --> 13:14.810
He folded like it
was laundry day.

13:14.810 --> 13:16.830
- Where'd he get the boat?
- Virginia Key.

13:17.010 --> 13:19.900
Delko and I are headed over
there right now. How 'bout you?

13:19.910 --> 13:22.160
I am going to go get the shooter.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.500
Still there
Down to the ground

13:56.270 --> 14:00.060
Byron Middlebrook.
You are under arrest, my friend.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.150
You got the wrong guy, man.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.610
That's not what your ex-partner
Deuce Deuce says.

14:04.660 --> 14:06.140
Why you believe what he's sayin'?

14:06.140 --> 14:08.920
Because he's the one that's talking.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.410
Horatio, I caught your case.

15:12.070 --> 15:16.770
Byron Middlebrook, a. k.a. "B. Slick,"
is going in propria persona.

15:16.770 --> 15:17.690
He's defending himself?

15:18.080 --> 15:22.680
Yeah. I'd say he has a fool for a client, except
for the fact that he spent three years behind bars.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.410
In the law library, right, Don?

15:24.650 --> 15:28.560
Well, he knows enough to ask for arraignment,
prelim and bail all in one hearing.

15:28.580 --> 15:29.610
So the clock is ticking.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.670
Whether we have our
evidence ready or not.

15:32.820 --> 15:36.210
Don, my witness will be there.

15:38.020 --> 15:44.130
Mr. De Labeque, can you identify the man who
shot at Jennifer Valdez? Is he in the courtroom?

15:44.220 --> 15:46.900
Yes, he is.
He's right there.

15:48.030 --> 15:52.520
Let the record reflect that the witness
identified the defendant, Byron Middlebrook.

15:53.590 --> 15:54.500
No further questions.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.470
Cross?

15:57.980 --> 15:59.940
Thank you, Your Honor.

15:59.940 --> 16:03.370
Mr. Middlebrook, I caution you one more
time against defending yourself.

16:03.970 --> 16:06.570
Are you sure you want to continue
without an attorney?

16:06.570 --> 16:13.590
Judge... I done spent more time in courtrooms than this here
legal secretary you assigned to babysit me.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.270
I'm an attorney with the
Public Defender's Office.

16:16.730 --> 16:20.490
Ms. Reynoso is not baby-sitting. She
is assisting you in court procedure.

16:20.890 --> 16:22.450
That's all good, Judge.

16:22.880 --> 16:29.490
So, uh, procedurally, I got no
questions for this... witness... today.

16:29.870 --> 16:33.670
If there's no affirmative defense, I'm
holding you to answer for the murder count.

16:34.350 --> 16:35.820
Bail is set at $500,000.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.970
The defendant will post
said bail forthwith.

16:40.430 --> 16:41.550
The witness may step down.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.050
Hey, fool, I'll see your
sorry ass at trial.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.720
You see me right now. Punk, what you
wanna do? You talkin' all that smack.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.050
Mr. De Labeque,
take a seat outside in the hall.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.260
You need to control your witness.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.320
Yeah, you need to control
your punk-ass snitch.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.650
- Man, I got your...
- Mr. De Labeque.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.100
Bailiff, take the witness into custody.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.440
I'm holding you in contempt.
Three days in County lockup.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.430
Dennis, you need
to stay calm now. Okay?

17:04.609 --> 17:07.220
Man, this is bogus. You're locking
me up and letting the killer go.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.560
I will not have any more violence
in my courtroom. Are we clear?

17:10.829 --> 17:11.780
Crystal, Your Honor.

17:12.960 --> 17:13.849
Kid makes a point.

17:14.230 --> 17:18.480
Our witness is behind bars, and the defendant
posts bail and goes back out on the street.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.670
Not for long.

17:19.670 --> 17:22.470
Oh, I want to believe you, Horatio.
Just get me the evidence.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.560
Coming up.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.020
GSR on our defendant's shirt.

17:57.100 --> 18:00.040
He was in close proximity to
a recently- fired weapon.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.970
But it doesn't prove he's our shooter.
Not in a court of law.

18:06.970 --> 18:09.000
Neither does the gun
that I recovered.

18:09.110 --> 18:10.320
Superglued it. No prints.

18:10.320 --> 18:15.480
Yes, but you found it at the bottom of the bay,
so that is not surprising. Expended rounds, please?

18:15.760 --> 18:20.720
I recovered a dozen nine-millimeters, including one with Jenny
Valdez's blood on it. I'm going to put it all in the report

18:20.720 --> 18:21.660
Take your time.

18:23.660 --> 18:26.450
No report, no discovery
for our Pro Per.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.270
We can play Middlebrook's game.

18:28.270 --> 18:30.470
He has moved for a motion to suppress.

18:30.930 --> 18:31.700
- What?
- Yep.

18:32.610 --> 18:34.820
We haven't even finished processing.
What's he going to suppress?

18:34.820 --> 18:36.190
Evidence from the boat.

18:36.650 --> 18:40.370
- It's a stall tactic.
- Yes, but it's within the letter of the law. We'd better cover our bases.

18:55.350 --> 18:57.540
Legal defense for Byron Middlebrook.
Who's in charge?

18:57.590 --> 19:01.110
- I'm CSI Duquesne. Can I help you, Mr. Middlebrook?
- Yeah.

19:02.660 --> 19:05.790
I got a court order here,
says I can peep my evidence.

19:05.820 --> 19:09.500
This court order only gives you the right to look
at the crime scene reports and the photographs.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.410
No, no, no, baby. Pictures is bunk-

19:12.470 --> 19:17.040
I want to see y'all bullets, the casings,
the gun, dead girl's property, everything.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.640
Sir, you have no right
to come into this lab.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.910
Law says as a Pro Per defendant,
I can inspect this facility.

19:21.920 --> 19:27.280
The law says that you can hire a court-certified expert
to examine the evidence and the procedure in the lab.

19:27.330 --> 19:30.150
Who's the best one?
Give me some names, Britney.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.620
Look, your legal aide can help you out with
that. In the meantime you need to leave.

19:33.690 --> 19:35.060
Apparently, all y'all are
not hearing me.

19:36.290 --> 19:37.610
No, I'm hearing you just fine.

19:37.830 --> 19:41.240
Okay, then just get out of my way, Jack.
Allow me to exercise my rights.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.710
Oh! Oh-ho, whoo!

19:45.600 --> 19:46.270
Now you done did it.

19:46.690 --> 19:49.000
You messed up. You just assaulted
an officer of the court.

19:49.920 --> 19:50.840
You know what, Mr. Middlebrook?

19:50.850 --> 19:55.250
We will be happy to forward all of the appropriate
legal documentation through the right channels,

19:55.250 --> 19:57.100
and you have every right to use
your power of subpoena.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.910
Power of subpoena, a'ight.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.950
I'm going to play your little game.

20:10.450 --> 20:11.780
I'll get with you.

20:17.860 --> 20:19.320
You undermined me.

20:20.000 --> 20:20.440
What?

20:20.440 --> 20:22.730
You made it look like I couldn't
stand my ground.

20:22.730 --> 20:24.220
Well, I thought you could
use a little help.

20:24.260 --> 20:26.100
I know, but I had it under control.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.460
From my point of view, it looked like
he was going to run a blitz on you.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.210
I- I'm sorry that I tried to help.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.690
So am I.

21:08.070 --> 21:10.050
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:10.450 --> 21:12.700
Thought you'd want to know
I got a hold of Stevie's aunt.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.740
She's driving here from Oregon.

21:16.280 --> 21:20.540
I didn't mention to her he'll have
to stick around to testify at trial.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.970
We already have a witness.

21:22.510 --> 21:23.530
There is strength in numbers.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.440
This kid had a physiological reaction
to Middlebrook's picture,

21:26.480 --> 21:27.870
and now you're going to put
him in court with the man?

21:28.770 --> 21:29.820
The boy saw the killer.

21:29.820 --> 21:32.090
Yes. He also saw his mother
get killed, too.

21:34.490 --> 21:38.020
I know you want to protect him.
We may not have a choice, Horatio.

21:38.910 --> 21:41.320
States attorney's going to want
to see both eyewitnesses up there.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.410
Not if there's one name in the report.

22:02.490 --> 22:04.690
The consol was too dark to see
it with the naked eye.

22:05.200 --> 22:05.700
Blood?

22:06.310 --> 22:08.960
Yeah that's a high-velocity
spatter from a bullet hit.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.640
Our defendant didn't have a mark on him.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.650
No, and we haven't located the
driver of the boat, have we?

22:17.710 --> 22:22.190
- We may have a second victim.
- And our witness may have just become a murderer.

22:23.080 --> 22:27.370
Yo, man, I told you.
I didn't shoot nobody at my party.

22:27.580 --> 22:34.990
You've already admitted to returning fire.
Maybe it was you who shot the driver.

22:35.090 --> 22:38.310
Hold up, man, all I know is that I saw that
punk Slick letting off at my house.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.420
Besides, I'd know if I shot somebody.

22:40.530 --> 22:45.380
You see, the problem is that the blood in
the boat tells me a different story.

22:45.380 --> 22:46.110
This ain't right, man.

22:46.510 --> 22:50.370
So, you mean to tell me Slick lets off on
my house, and he's on the street.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.880
Meanwhile, I fire two shots in self-defense,
hit the vehicle, and I'm the one locked up?

22:54.880 --> 22:59.250
- You fired two shots?
- Yeah, man-double tap. Hit the boat both times.

23:00.140 --> 23:03.100
It's the truth, man.
He jumped off on me.

23:04.530 --> 23:06.500
Okay. I'm going to take a look into that.

23:06.790 --> 23:14.000
But if I find out that you're lying to me, B.
Slick is going to be the least of your problems.

23:44.040 --> 23:49.000
- Good news?
- The eyewitness checks out.

23:49.110 --> 23:51.770
- How can I help you?
- Other way around, actually.

23:51.770 --> 23:53.380
I heard about your pro per.

23:54.430 --> 23:56.030
He's going to have your lab
under a microscope.

23:56.030 --> 23:58.770
- Worse than IAB?
- Exactly my point.

23:58.910 --> 24:03.400
I thought I would drop by, offer any help
I can in dealing with unorthodox scrutiny.

24:03.570 --> 24:06.540
- I think we're going to be okay, Rick.
- Yelina said you'd say that.

24:06.540 --> 24:09.500
- She could have saved you the trip.
- It's not a problem.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.770
- My door's always open.
- Appreciate that.

24:20.470 --> 24:22.280
- Horatio.
- We got a problem.

24:30.650 --> 24:31.850
What happened?

24:33.360 --> 24:37.050
Court line officers put him in here for
transport. Suspect was already inside.

24:38.050 --> 24:41.610
- Witnesses?
- Four other inmates, a whole slew of custody personnel.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.800
Said the killer could've
cared less who saw him.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.390
This guy is too yoked up
for County. He's a lifer.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.010
He's a three-striker from State Pen.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.070
Transferred from Rayford this afternoon.

24:51.070 --> 24:54.060
Brought down here to testify in
the Middlebrook case, right?

24:54.440 --> 24:55.270
As a character witness.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.700
Middlebrook brought him down
here to hit our guy.

24:57.980 --> 25:01.620
De Labecque... knew eventually they'd
run into each other.

25:03.790 --> 25:05.820
But at least we've still got the boy.

25:05.820 --> 25:08.920
Listen to me. I am not going to
put this kid in further danger.

25:09.110 --> 25:11.500
Yeah, well, even if you don't,
Middlebrook's got a long reach.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.580
So do I.

25:24.270 --> 25:26.530
Yelina, I was hoping that
Stevie could stay with you.

25:26.980 --> 25:27.870
How long?

25:28.070 --> 25:31.450
Just a day or two.
Till his aunt gets here.

25:33.150 --> 25:37.740
Because Middlebrook would look for him at your
place, and you don't want to dump him in the system.

25:37.980 --> 25:39.190
I know it's a lot to ask.

25:40.990 --> 25:42.380
That's why it's called a favor.

25:43.470 --> 25:44.190
Thank you.

25:45.620 --> 25:46.460
How's he doing?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.680
He says he can't remember what
his mother's voice sounds like.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.440
- I don't believe this.
- What's up?

27:03.760 --> 27:06.530
I told this guy what do to do,
and he did it.

27:06.810 --> 27:07.500
A subpoena?

27:08.050 --> 27:09.500
My pro per's putting me on the stand.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.820
He's some sort of legal Neanderthal,
He thinks he's Johnny Cochran.

27:11.870 --> 27:13.890
It's harassment.
He's trying to throw you off your game.

27:14.390 --> 27:17.160
- When are you on call?
- I'm not; it's a "be there" subpoena.

27:17.350 --> 27:19.420
- What should I do?
- Be there?

27:23.830 --> 27:26.580
You contend that this bullet
was recovered from that house?

27:27.430 --> 27:28.660
The southwest-facing wall.

27:28.690 --> 27:33.000
And you contend that those red marks
on that there bullet are blood?

27:33.280 --> 27:34.940
I'm not contending anything.

27:35.060 --> 27:38.230
DNA indicates a match. This is the
bullet that killed Jennifer Valdez.

27:44.870 --> 27:50.580
What about this gun? I want to know
specifically where you recovered this gun from.

27:50.710 --> 27:53.220
I cannot testify to that.
I did not recover that gun.

27:54.390 --> 27:55.980
But you're an expert on firearms.

27:56.090 --> 27:58.540
You're sitting here today trying
to put this gun in my hands.

27:58.730 --> 28:01.420
I am not trying to do anything.
The evidence will speak for itself.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.760
Mr. Middlebrook, get to your point,
and stop wasting the court's time.

28:05.070 --> 28:06.370
You run a tight ship, Judge.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.000
So... were there any marks on that bullet?

28:10.170 --> 28:12.400
Markings indicate the
bullet was a six right.

28:16.590 --> 28:18.410
Looks messed up.
You could tell all that from this?

28:18.650 --> 28:21.530
The projectile was damaged,
but it wasn't messed up.

28:21.770 --> 28:24.780
- You mean "mutilated. "
- Misshapen.

28:31.700 --> 28:35.800
But there were enough characteristics to
determine that's a six right nine-millimeter.

28:37.960 --> 28:38.970
Six right.

28:40.300 --> 28:43.370
According to the FBI's manual on
general rifling characteristics,

28:43.840 --> 28:46.140
ain't that the most common rifling
used in a firearm?

28:47.980 --> 28:52.850
Yes, but this particular bullet is consistent
with the firearm recovered in this case.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.390
"Consistent. "

28:56.330 --> 28:58.930
But can you match this
bullet with this gun?

29:08.200 --> 29:09.230
Not at present.

29:09.230 --> 29:11.190
I'm done with her, Judge.

29:21.980 --> 29:25.460
Hey, did you use small-particle reagent
on Middlebrook's weapon?

29:25.500 --> 29:26.920
Yeah, and I got zero prints.

29:27.740 --> 29:30.320
- What about Sudan black?
- Did it. Nothing.

29:30.390 --> 29:34.320
- Gentian violet?
- I tried them all, Calleigh, and there are no prints on that gun.

29:35.070 --> 29:37.130
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were trying to undermine me.

29:39.050 --> 29:42.330
Oh... I'm sorry.

29:42.970 --> 29:47.090
I probably played right into Middlebrook's
hand by squabbling with you like that.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.320
It's okay, we're cool.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.370
You know, I admire you. This case is falling
apart, and you are staying right on keel.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.690
It's because I just found
something interesting.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.860
- Fingerprints?
- Four digits.

29:58.510 --> 29:59.630
I pulled these off of the boat.

30:01.390 --> 30:02.260
They're interrupted.

30:03.030 --> 30:05.830
That's not the interesting part.
Try a look through the loupe.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.900
There's foreign residue.
I can barely see it.

30:12.900 --> 30:14.650
I've still got to test it.

30:27.410 --> 30:29.460
Blood. Wiped away part of that print.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.590
Whose print? Is it Byron Middlebrook's?

30:32.180 --> 30:36.000
Nope. But it's probably the person
who helped him clean up his mess.

30:40.990 --> 30:43.280
Bob Davenport... "Eminem. "

30:44.490 --> 30:48.120
Bob, you're a smart guy.
Take a look at that.

30:50.630 --> 30:51.460
What's up with this?

30:51.960 --> 30:57.690
What's up with that is that it's your handprint
on the boat with a blood smear over it.

30:58.450 --> 31:01.950
- So?
- So, that means you were there first, Bob, then the bleeder.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.550
And since we know someone
got shot on the boat...

31:05.570 --> 31:08.220
Hey, man, when I found that boat,
that body was already there.

31:08.310 --> 31:09.850
- Whose body?
- I don't know, man.

31:20.250 --> 31:22.270
I kind of freaked out.
What you want me to do?

31:22.270 --> 31:24.290
I took the boat,
dead homie and all.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.080
What'd you do with the body?

31:27.440 --> 31:28.800
I gave him the slip.

31:39.010 --> 31:40.990
Look, man, that's how it went down.
I'm telling you the truth.

31:41.420 --> 31:43.970
would be the first time you told me
the truth since I met you.

31:45.530 --> 31:48.290
Look, man, homeboy is probably
still out there.

31:48.390 --> 31:50.330
It's Rum Point, this side
of Catcher's Marina.

31:50.620 --> 31:51.970
Why don't you go look for yourself?

31:52.050 --> 31:53.920
I got a better idea.
You're going to show me.

32:02.660 --> 32:04.850
- Nothing, Frank.
- That's it.

32:05.170 --> 32:05.810
Hold on, dude.

32:05.870 --> 32:08.500
I swear on my mama, man,
this is exactly where I dumped homeboy.

32:08.870 --> 32:12.110
Listen, you little cracker,
I've about had it with your minstrel act.

32:12.240 --> 32:14.780
Frank, take it easy.
He could be telling the truth.

32:15.210 --> 32:17.950
Bottom's all damaged.
Coral's broken up.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.540
Where you going with this?
Shrimp trowlers

32:20.540 --> 32:23.440
They attach these metal chains called
"ticklers" to the bottom of their nets.

32:23.590 --> 32:25.660
They drag them along,
scare up the shrimp.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.290
I thought this area was off
limits to shrimpers.

32:32.430 --> 32:33.710
Doesn't mean they don't do it.

32:34.920 --> 32:35.970
All right.

32:36.930 --> 32:39.250
I'll call Fish and Game,
get a list of their favorite poachers.

32:41.470 --> 32:42.490
Illegal trawling?

32:43.740 --> 32:45.420
I don't know what you're
talking about.

32:45.420 --> 32:50.170
Well, according to Florida Fish and Game Captain
Pine, your outfit's the worst offender in the marina.

32:50.630 --> 32:52.080
Four citations in six months?

32:53.090 --> 32:54.590
Yeah, Fish and Game got it in for me.

32:55.310 --> 32:57.440
We need to see your catch, please.

33:06.100 --> 33:07.630
So, you don't trawl in
the no-fishing zones?

33:08.060 --> 33:09.090
That's right.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.820
Hey, how do you explain this?

33:10.820 --> 33:13.060
It's black coral, a protected species.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.500
You know, last year,
it was a sea snail, this year is coral

33:16.420 --> 33:18.820
They keep on shrinking
the areas we can shrimp.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.150
Law's the law, sir.

33:20.150 --> 33:21.910
Yeah, I still got to
make a living, though.

33:21.910 --> 33:23.920
Hey, Jacques Cousteau,
why don't you open this other net here?

33:30.890 --> 33:31.560
God.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.390
Well, Captain, looks like you just
went over your limit.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.740
Our floater is one
Wesley Simmons.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.570
He's a known associate
of Byron Middlebrook.

33:54.090 --> 33:59.320
Three GSWs to the upper
torso... back to front.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.660
All through-and-throughs.
Bled out internally.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.850
But Dennis De Labeque's weapon
only discharged twice. I confirmed that.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.650
Maybe there was another shooter,
someone else at the party?

34:50.560 --> 34:51.960
I got your page.
What's up?

34:51.969 --> 34:53.800
I need you and Eric to string the boat.

34:54.139 --> 34:55.850
Sure. What are we looking for?

34:56.130 --> 34:57.780
Well, I don't want to bias you,
all right?

34:57.780 --> 34:58.980
Ooh, I love a mystery.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.380
Horatio, look what Mr. Pro
Per just hung on me.

35:04.420 --> 35:05.880
Motion for sanctions.

35:06.550 --> 35:07.310
Sanctions?

35:07.580 --> 35:10.910
Middlebrook's claiming we held back
information concerning our eyewitnesses.

35:11.320 --> 35:15.970
Now, he wins this, Judge could toss our
evidence, maybe even dismiss the whole damn case.

35:15.970 --> 35:16.680
"Eyewitnesses. "

35:18.020 --> 35:19.200
Yeah.

35:19.260 --> 35:24.280
Frank, you sanitized these reports, right, and
deleted any reference to Stevie Valdez, didn't you?

35:24.320 --> 35:26.580
Blacked out every line by hand.
Me and Yelina both. Why?

35:26.580 --> 35:29.300
He's written "eyewitnesses" in
his motion. He knows about the kid.

35:33.090 --> 35:39.800
This is Horatio Caine. I need 315s,
1805 Palmfrond. Detective Salas' residence.

35:39.800 --> 35:40.560
Copy that!

35:59.230 --> 36:01.230
Fl..day
Police

36:04.380 --> 36:05.670
Get him! Get him!

36:24.990 --> 36:33.690
I ... I don't... I don't know what to say other than I'm sorry
that I put you and Ray Jr. in the middle of this.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.800
Thank you for your call.

36:35.530 --> 36:38.020
We were, uh, able to take cover.

36:39.520 --> 36:41.880
Okay, well, that's good.
and there'ss

36:42.190 --> 36:48.640
There's... there's obviously a leak here, and I'm gonna move
Stevie to another location with round- the-clock security, okay?

36:48.640 --> 36:49.290
That's good.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.830
If you don't mind, I'm going to just...

36:51.070 --> 36:55.700
I'm gonna stay put, stay out here
tonight, uh, in case Ray Jr. wants to...

36:55.700 --> 36:56.200
Um, no. No, that's...
I'm gonna stay put, stay out here
tonight, uh, in case Ray Jr. wants to...

36:56.200 --> 36:58.750
Um, no. No, that's...

36:58.770 --> 36:59.990
It's fine. It's okay.

36:59.990 --> 37:02.740
We're, um... We're going to be fine.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.040
No, I get it.

37:10.370 --> 37:11.010
Horatio...

37:11.140 --> 37:14.240
Okay, uh... so I... okay.

37:14.730 --> 37:16.860
- Yes.
- All right. Good night.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.020
Yep.

37:26.950 --> 37:31.340
- Horatio.
- Yes, sir?

37:32.090 --> 37:35.300
- Found our leak.
- Surprise me.

37:37.290 --> 37:40.460
So we're clear, you're the, uh,
legal aide to Byron Middlebrook?

37:40.500 --> 37:43.270
I work with the Public Defender's Office,
Judge appointed me to the case.

37:43.780 --> 37:47.000
You make it a habit of giving sensitive
police information to all your clients?

37:47.130 --> 37:48.660
Pertinent information.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.880
According to the visitors' log,
you were in MDPD yesterday.

37:53.190 --> 37:56.850
So ... It's just for a day or two,
until his aunt gets in town.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.220
Because Middlebrook would look
for him at your place.

37:59.220 --> 38:00.180
I know it's a lot to ask.

38:00.490 --> 38:01.920
That's why it's called a favor.

38:04.710 --> 38:08.500
I informed my client of a potential
eyewitness. I won't apologize for that.

38:08.680 --> 38:12.700
The eyewitness is a boy who was
almost killed, in a drive- by.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.470
Two guesses who arranged it.

38:15.430 --> 38:18.080
I can't be responsible for
what a client might arrange.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.660
Is that how you sleep at night, Monica?

38:20.200 --> 38:21.340
Hey, I was just doing my job.

38:21.790 --> 38:25.170
Well, we're going to do everything in our power
to get you disbarred. What do you think about that?

38:25.170 --> 38:26.020
Are you guys serious?

38:26.560 --> 38:28.680
We're just doing our jobs, Monica.

38:29.130 --> 38:30.480
You can relate to that.

38:33.460 --> 38:35.460
Judge wants us back at court at 10:00.

38:35.470 --> 38:36.170
Sanction hearing.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.850
I suppose you teed this up for
Middlebrook, too, huh?

38:44.100 --> 38:49.050
Calleigh, get me everything you have on
this case, please. it's about to go south.

38:58.170 --> 39:04.180
All rise. People vs. Byron Middlebrook.
Honorable Judge Veracruz presiding.

39:04.180 --> 39:05.310
The court is hereby in session.

39:10.140 --> 39:15.280
Upon further review, I believe Mr.
Middlebrook's motion for sanctions has merit.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.440
The People withheld
the existence of a material eyewitness.

39:18.200 --> 39:24.160
Prudent, in that we believe he arranged the
murder of our first eyewitness in his jail cell.

39:24.840 --> 39:28.590
Man, I didn't arrange nothing.
You defaming my character.

39:28.700 --> 39:32.410
Mr. Middlebrook, this is a court of law.
Please keep your comments to yourself.

39:33.550 --> 39:37.790
And let me say that I am disappointed with
the conduct of the prosecution in this matter.

39:38.190 --> 39:44.190
I certainly hope that this will be the last time that such
actions are perpetrated by the State attorney's office.

39:44.850 --> 39:48.930
Withholding key evidence is a grave matter
regardless of the motivation behind it.

39:49.810 --> 39:51.980
And so, based on the information before me,

39:51.980 --> 39:56.460
I'm going to grant the defendant's motion
and exclude the eyewitness, a Steven Valdez...

39:58.100 --> 40:01.650
although something tells me that that will
please both the defense and the prosecution.

40:02.250 --> 40:05.200
So, Wesley Simmons was driving the boat
when he got shot, right?

40:05.230 --> 40:07.060
H found the blood on the console.

40:07.060 --> 40:11.340
And Alexx said he was shot
three times back to front, left to right.

40:12.600 --> 40:16.400
The trajectory's inconsistent. There is no
way that he could've been shot from the shore.

40:18.490 --> 40:21.570
That's what Horatio was talking about.
You drive. I'll write the report.

40:22.740 --> 40:28.410
Are the People able to proceed with their case against
Byron Middlebrook in the shooting death of Jennifer Valdez?

40:28.410 --> 40:30.660
No, Your Honor, the People are not.

40:31.100 --> 40:34.250
Then I have no choice
but to dismiss this case without prejudice.

40:34.380 --> 40:35.640
Court is in recess.

40:42.210 --> 40:43.930
Here we go.

40:47.110 --> 40:48.030
Thank you.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.440
Thank you, ma'am.

40:53.310 --> 40:54.810
Uh, Your Honor,
could we have a moment?

40:57.640 --> 40:59.030
Ain't you gonna congratulate me?

40:59.030 --> 41:00.190
On the contrary, Byron.

41:00.420 --> 41:02.020
- Hook him up, Frank.
- Gladly.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.240
You better get this cowboy off of me.

41:06.430 --> 41:08.880
Mr. Haffman, would you like to,
uh, enlighten the court?

41:08.880 --> 41:14.530
Yes, Your Honor, we're filing a new case against
Mr. Middlebrook for the murder of Wesley Simmons.

41:15.390 --> 41:16.330
Like hell.

41:16.830 --> 41:17.980
This is harassment.

41:17.980 --> 41:19.020
Who is Wesley Simmons?

41:19.210 --> 41:22.480
- His crime partner.
- And the driver of the boat.

41:24.840 --> 41:29.610
We can prove that Wesley Simmons was shot
by you from inside the boat.

41:33.260 --> 41:34.670
That's ridiculous, Judge.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.930
Why would I shoot the dude that's driving?

41:37.380 --> 41:39.500
It's called tunnel vision, my friend.

41:49.110 --> 41:50.770
Too bad he ain't around to testify.

41:50.770 --> 41:53.840
Here's the beautiful part, Byron.
He doesn't have to be.

41:54.880 --> 41:55.760
You got nothing.

41:55.760 --> 41:56.690
That's not true, either.

41:57.010 --> 41:57.930
Take a look at this.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.920
I have his blood on your shirt.

42:00.940 --> 42:02.380
It's called high-velocity spatter.

42:06.640 --> 42:07.880
It proves you shot him.

42:09.880 --> 42:11.110
Judge, what's my bail?

42:11.110 --> 42:14.350
Your case is no longer before this
court, Mr. Middlebrook. There is no bail.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.450
You're under arrest, Slick.

42:18.010 --> 42:20.600
Byron, have a nice stay.

42:22.020 --> 42:23.640
Come on...

42:49.360 --> 42:51.920
The policeman said you got
the guy who hurt my mom.

42:52.120 --> 42:53.330
We did. We got him.

42:56.810 --> 42:58.890
I keep on trying to remember her voice.

43:01.510 --> 43:04.220
Well, you know, partner,
it'll come back to you.

43:05.420 --> 43:08.500
All the good things about your mom
are going to come back to you.

43:11.760 --> 43:14.740
I... I have something for you.

43:18.270 --> 43:19.520
This belongs to you now.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.970
You don't have to wait with me.

43:27.620 --> 43:32.060
Stevie... there's no other
place I'd rather be.
