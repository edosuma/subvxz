[narrator]
Previously onHalo.

00:03.090 --> 00:04.482
I want to go back
to Madrigal.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.267
Vinsher'’s taking over.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.616
I have to join the resistance.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.183
I promised John
I'’d keep you safe.

00:09.226 --> 00:11.228
I don'’t see any reason
to break that promise.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.188
[John]
This isn'’t necessary.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.406
I don'’t need a babysitter.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.756
This is an upgrade.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.150
She'’s gonna make you
even better.

00:20.194 --> 00:21.630
Hello, Master Chief.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.458
I'’m Cortana.

00:23.501 --> 00:24.633
So it answers
to my command?

00:24.676 --> 00:26.200
I see it as more
of a partnership.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.680
[Parangosky]
I want you to lead a team

00:28.724 --> 00:30.204
in analyzing this artifact.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.857
Determine what it is,
what it does,

00:31.901 --> 00:35.252
and if in fact it'’s part
of some kind of weapon.

00:35.296 --> 00:38.125
I could kill you for trying
to steal my favorite ship.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.561
-My family is rich.
-How rich?

00:39.604 --> 00:41.345
Deuterium rich.

00:41.389 --> 00:44.131
All you have to do is get me
to them and you get paid.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.263
-I don'’t feel anything.
-[Cortana] The hormonal pellet

00:46.307 --> 00:48.396
in your spine suppresses
emotional responses.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.441
It'’s part of what makes you
a Spartan.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.226
[Soren]
Lose the pellet...

00:53.618 --> 00:55.490
and it'’s like
opening your eyes

00:55.533 --> 00:59.233
for the first time
after living in the dark.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.498
[John]
They'’re memories of my family.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.848
-Another one?
-See how they go together?

01:07.676 --> 01:09.199
There are two artifacts.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.635
I saw it as a child...

01:10.679 --> 01:12.202
on Eridanus II.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.508
I'’m going.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.379
[Adun]
And if returning to Eridanus

01:15.423 --> 01:17.120
brings back other memories,

01:17.164 --> 01:19.209
the truth could bring us
all down.

01:19.253 --> 01:22.169
[Halsey]
That is what Cortana is for.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.826

Left, right, left!

01:30.481 --> 01:32.396
Stay in formation!

01:32.440 --> 01:33.702
Do not fall behind!

01:33.745 --> 01:35.617
[whistles blowing]

01:35.660 --> 01:37.358
There is no pain in service!

01:37.401 --> 01:38.707
Only pride!

01:38.750 --> 01:43.146
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

01:43.190 --> 01:45.583
Eyes forward!
Come on, move your feet!

01:45.627 --> 01:49.196
Left! Left! Left!

01:49.239 --> 01:50.980
-Who are you?
-[all] Spartans!

01:51.023 --> 01:53.983
-I can'’t hear you!
-Spartans!

01:54.026 --> 01:55.332
[Mendez]
Louder!

01:55.376 --> 01:56.812
Spartans!

01:56.855 --> 01:58.379
[Mendez]
Who are you?

01:58.422 --> 02:00.250
[all]
Spartans!

02:00.294 --> 02:02.470
-Louder!
-Spartans!

02:02.513 --> 02:05.647
-I can'’t hear you!
-Spartans!

02:25.275 --> 02:29.323
Senior Chief Mendez tells me
you tried to run away again.

02:29.366 --> 02:32.413
John, what is the issue?

02:32.456 --> 02:34.328
I want to go home.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.678
This is your home.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.810
It wasn'’t always.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.726
I see.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.642
And what do you know
about that?

02:44.686 --> 02:45.991
Jai told me.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.559
He said we were all forced
to come here.

02:48.603 --> 02:51.301
Do you feel like
you were forced?

02:52.433 --> 02:53.782
I can'’t remember.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.653
You were asked
to join us.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.394
And do you know why?

02:57.438 --> 02:59.614
Because you are special,

02:59.657 --> 03:02.312
and you have a mission.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.531
Of all the young Spartans,

03:03.574 --> 03:05.359
I believe that you have
the skills

03:05.402 --> 03:08.188
and the natural ability
to be their leader.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.799
In fact...

03:11.930 --> 03:13.758
I'’m counting on it.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.285
You'’re going
to save all of us.

03:22.811 --> 03:27.772
[low rumble]

03:31.776 --> 03:33.909
[indistinct chatter over PA]

03:33.952 --> 03:35.345
[Halsey]
How'’s he doing?

03:35.389 --> 03:37.956
[Adun]
Definitely un-Spartan-like.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.656
It'’s odd that a weapon could
cause this kind of behavior.

03:41.699 --> 03:44.398
I'’m not convinced
it is a weapon.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.878
Take the Madrigal object.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.053
Clearly it'’s capable
of emitting

03:48.097 --> 03:50.491
enormous amounts
of energy.

03:50.534 --> 03:51.970
But to John'’s touch,

03:52.014 --> 03:55.974
it seems to act with
a kind of agency or purpose,

03:56.018 --> 03:58.716
either responding
to John'’s needs,

03:58.760 --> 04:00.457
or anticipating
what the situation requires,

04:00.501 --> 04:01.763
which must mean that--

04:01.806 --> 04:03.330
So there is an intelligence
behind it.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.505
Yes.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.767
And if that'’s connected

04:05.810 --> 04:08.378
to a greater intelligence
somewhere,

04:08.422 --> 04:09.988
then I want to meet it.

04:11.729 --> 04:12.904
Why John?

04:12.948 --> 04:15.559
Why did it choose him?

04:15.603 --> 04:17.518
What makes him so special?

04:17.561 --> 04:21.391
I'’ve been asking myself that
same question since I met him.

04:21.435 --> 04:25.308
I'’ve gone over his original
blood samples from before...

04:25.352 --> 04:26.788
[voice fading]

04:26.831 --> 04:28.355
[Cortana]
Master Chief,

04:28.398 --> 04:31.009
we'’re 17 minutes
out of Eridanus II.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.925
Where will we start our search
for the second artifact?

04:35.753 --> 04:37.538
Chief?

04:37.581 --> 04:39.453
Looks different.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.106
What, exactly?

04:41.150 --> 04:42.456
Slipspace.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.109
Actually, the human eye
is not capable

04:44.153 --> 04:45.763
of perceiving
slipspace.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.330
What you think you are seeing
is in fact

04:47.374 --> 04:49.463
a ten-dimensional
mobius navigation equation

04:49.506 --> 04:51.813
with evolving exit
and mass-shadowed spacetime--

04:51.856 --> 04:53.510
You'’re ruining it.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.906
Your blood pressure,
heart rate,

04:57.949 --> 05:00.430
and electrodermal activity
are all elevated.

05:00.474 --> 05:01.997
So what?

05:02.040 --> 05:05.653
[Cortana] My data suggests
you are experiencing anxiety.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.786
Is this what anxious
feels like?

05:09.918 --> 05:11.485
Technically.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.491
I'’m going home.

05:41.906 --> 05:45.475
[opening theme music plays]

06:53.195 --> 06:55.110
[Kwan]
Any sign of Vinsher'’s ships?

06:55.153 --> 06:57.068
You know there are radar
sentries all over the place.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.549
I know how to avoid detection.

06:59.593 --> 07:00.550
Trust me.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.944
"Trust me,"
says the pirate.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.468
Don'’t knock pirating.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.991
Speaking of which,

07:07.035 --> 07:09.124
you know you'’re not just paying
for the security, right?

07:09.167 --> 07:10.995
Meter started running
at breakfast.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.780
I'’ll pay extra
if you stop talking.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.129
Please.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.526
Somebody needs some more sleep.

07:19.569 --> 07:20.918
I can'’t sleep.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.228
[Soren]
Bad memories.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.231
When I first escaped
the Spartan program,

07:29.274 --> 07:31.494
I had no memory
of anything.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.975
My mind was wiped
completely.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.804
-[console beeping]
-That sounds amazing.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.632
-[switch clicks]
-Actually, it was awful.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.547
Without it, I was lost.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.029
Did the memories
ever come back?

07:45.073 --> 07:46.553
Bit by bit.

07:48.293 --> 07:51.253
It was a year before I
remembered that my father died.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.256
Another year...

07:55.344 --> 07:58.521
before I remembered that I
was the one who killed him.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.482
Oh.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.614
Memory'’s what
lets you know who you are

08:04.658 --> 08:08.923
and reminds you
what'’s important to you.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.032
Kai.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.947
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.864
Have you seen
Master Chief?

08:36.907 --> 08:38.692
He'’s with Halsey.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.521
On a mission.

08:44.915 --> 08:46.787
You okay?

08:46.830 --> 08:49.093
Fine. Yeah.

08:50.094 --> 08:52.749
I'’ll... see you later.

10:46.384 --> 10:50.998
Fertile forests built into
an otherwise hostile planet.

10:51.041 --> 10:54.349
This colony was led
by your parents.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.179
They were heroes...

10:59.049 --> 11:00.355
just like their son.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.671
That'’s my house.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.115
There was a clear line
of sight...

11:23.770 --> 11:26.120
from where my father
dug the hole to the balcony.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.730
Where my mother was.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.254
Let'’s have this be the end
of all this nonsense, John.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.343
Bury it, son.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.439
She was...

11:41.483 --> 11:43.528
[Young John]
No, I don'’t want to do it!

11:43.572 --> 11:45.139
Mom!

Around here.

Let'’s start digging.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.787
You couldn'’t get us
any closer?

12:24.831 --> 12:28.182
You may be paying the bills,
but we'’re gonna do this my way.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.271
I made a promise to John
to keep you safe,

12:30.314 --> 12:31.838
and I plan to honor it.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.841
So, keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

-No, too much.

See? Come on.

You have to buy it
now, sahib.

-Attu...
-Not so fast.

People are looking for you.
We shouldn'’t be here.

sees us together--

16:53.795 --> 16:54.665
Wow.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.667
Okay. Hello, Spartans.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.191
Thank you for coming.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.062
[Vannak] Dr. Keyes,
you have orders for us?

17:00.106 --> 17:01.672
Yes. Uh, I won'’t keep you long.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.544
I just wanted to do
some biometric tests--

17:03.587 --> 17:05.372
[Kai] That'’s the object
Master Chief and I saw

17:05.415 --> 17:07.069
in the cave on Madrigal.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.375
Is that what
this is all about?

17:08.418 --> 17:09.637
[Miranda]
Partially.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.769
I need to see how
the object reacts to you

17:11.813 --> 17:15.295
in order to determine what,
if anything,

17:15.338 --> 17:16.600
makes John so special.

17:16.644 --> 17:19.299
He'’s the Master Chief.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.605
Yes, he is.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.651
I'’ll go first, ma'am.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.044
Great.

17:26.784 --> 17:30.136
Riz 0-2-8, I'’ll be directing you
from behind the safety glass.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.224
You guys want to go outside?

17:36.142 --> 17:37.752
You all right there,
Kai 1-2-5?

17:37.795 --> 17:40.581
Yes, ma'’am.
One hundred percent.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.278
[footsteps recede]

17:43.627 --> 17:45.890
-Okay. Let'’s get to it.
-[door closes]

17:45.934 --> 17:47.675
Helmet off, please.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.774
[panting and grunting]

18:04.692 --> 18:07.347
[metallic thud]

18:07.390 --> 18:09.175
Found something.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.090
[Adun]
The artifact?

18:44.427 --> 18:45.863
[Halsey]
Drawings.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.349
[John]
Mine.

19:00.617 --> 19:03.272
I don'’t recognize this one.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.145
They'’re all identical.

19:14.327 --> 19:17.330
John, is there anything here
that can tell us

19:17.373 --> 19:21.725
where the larger object is,
or what it does?

19:22.857 --> 19:24.511
[Father]
John, do you hear me?

19:24.554 --> 19:26.295
I asked you what you'’re drawing.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.217
[Halsey] I think we should
head back to the ship,

19:35.261 --> 19:38.307
and we can analyze
the drawings there.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.617
John? John?

19:49.536 --> 19:51.799
[woman sings mourning song]

19:57.587 --> 19:59.720
[mourning song continues]

20:01.330 --> 20:03.289
[bell jingles]

20:21.916 --> 20:24.005
This is all my father gets?

20:24.048 --> 20:25.833
After all he did for his people,

20:25.876 --> 20:27.748
the whole city
should have turned out.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.576
[bell jingles]

20:29.619 --> 20:30.838
Uh-huh.

20:45.548 --> 20:46.723
That'’s Agatha.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.030
She'’s one of my dad's generals.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.472
[bell jingles]

20:56.516 --> 20:57.908
[whispering]
Agatha.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.389
[gasps]
Oh, Kwan!

21:02.130 --> 21:03.958
Oh, Kwan!

21:04.001 --> 21:06.700
I thought we'’d lost you too.

21:06.743 --> 21:10.486
It'’s dangerous here.
If Vinsher finds you--

21:10.530 --> 21:12.009
I know.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.794
Tell me, what'’s the plan?

21:14.751 --> 21:15.970
The plan?

21:16.013 --> 21:17.406
Raphael wasn'’t
at the outpost

21:17.450 --> 21:18.929
when we were attacked.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.889
Is he leading the resistance?
What about the others?

21:21.932 --> 21:24.587
Kwan, Raphael is dead.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.111
Vinsher made an example
of him.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.766
Along with Arwan,
Sook, Kim, Divali...

21:29.810 --> 21:31.377
My God.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.467
The attack on the outpost
changed everything, Kwan.

21:34.510 --> 21:35.729
Everything.

21:36.947 --> 21:39.559
The people are frightened.

21:39.602 --> 21:42.779
All they want now is protection
from the Covenant.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.041
And Vinsher'’s
offering that?

21:44.085 --> 21:46.783
Yes. And he has
the UNSC'’s support.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.872
-He has the Marines--
-But we can'’t just give up.

21:48.916 --> 21:50.396
We need to fight!

21:50.439 --> 21:52.049
I'’m sorry, Kwan.

21:52.093 --> 21:56.532
Vinsher allowed us to collect
our dead from the outpost,

21:56.576 --> 21:59.492
but the revolution is over.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.452
[Soren]
Okay, all right,

22:03.496 --> 22:06.063
well, thank you very much
for your help.

22:06.107 --> 22:07.456
Let'’s go.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.849
No, no, no, wait.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.677
Agatha, you were
my dad'’s most loyal friend.

22:10.720 --> 22:14.420
If anyone was going to take over
the rebel forces, it was you.

22:14.463 --> 22:18.075
And yet you'’re the only one
Vinsher didn'’t kill.

22:19.686 --> 22:22.515
How much is Vinsher paying you
to sell out the rebellion?

22:22.558 --> 22:24.168
You need to go.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.562
-You'’re putting us all at risk--
-You'’re a traitor!

22:28.129 --> 22:29.739
All of you!
My dad fought and died

22:29.783 --> 22:31.088
so you could all be free.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.003
And now you stand and pray,

22:33.047 --> 22:34.178
and you claim to honor him,

22:34.222 --> 22:35.789
but you'’re all cowards!

22:35.832 --> 22:37.921
-[man] Security forces!
-[all screaming]

22:53.981 --> 22:56.026
-[electricity zapping]
-[man screams]

22:57.680 --> 22:58.855
Let'’s go.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.642
[Miranda]
Okay, Vannak,

23:02.685 --> 23:04.818
place your right hand
on the artifact.

23:04.861 --> 23:06.123
Slowly, please.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.998
All right. Now your left.

23:16.873 --> 23:17.961
Same as Riz.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.486
Kai 1-2-5,
you'’re up next.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.058
You'’re going to need
to remove your helmet.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.582
Can'’t risk frying
the electronics.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.888
You just know Halsey'’ll
send me the bill.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.240
Okay.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.591
Is there anything wrong,
ma'’am?

23:38.634 --> 23:41.681
Your hair.
Did you do that to yourself?

23:41.724 --> 23:43.073
Yes.

23:43.117 --> 23:45.032
Great.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.991
You don'’t care for us,
do you, Doctor?

23:49.689 --> 23:51.038
Gives you that idea?

23:51.081 --> 23:53.040
Just a hunch.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.042
I didn'’t know Spartans
had hunches.

23:55.085 --> 23:57.174
Hunches win battles.

23:57.218 --> 24:00.003
From the age of 6,
I'’ve studied military strategy,

24:00.047 --> 24:01.875
from Sun Tzu
to Preston Cole.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.746
Riz speaks the languages
and dialects

24:03.790 --> 24:05.792
of every colonized planet.

24:05.835 --> 24:09.056
Vannak'’s battlefield discoveries
on the physics of plasma swords

24:09.099 --> 24:12.146
helped the Marines
develop stronger shielded vests.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.889
You see us as machines.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.805
But if you really want
to understand how we work,

24:18.848 --> 24:20.633
you'’re gonna have to dig
a little deeper.

24:20.676 --> 24:21.982
Wait!

24:23.200 --> 24:25.507
Any other tests, ma'’am?

24:30.686 --> 24:32.732
[door slides open]

24:32.775 --> 24:34.647
[footsteps recede]

24:41.131 --> 24:44.483
[heavy footsteps]

25:13.947 --> 25:15.557
Cortana?

25:15.601 --> 25:18.865
Can you show me what the house
used to look like?

25:18.908 --> 25:20.823
If I have enough
visual data,

25:20.867 --> 25:22.129
I can interpolate
and recreate

25:22.172 --> 25:24.087
a realistic facsimile
of the environment

25:24.131 --> 25:26.263
inside your heads-up display.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.224
Do it.

25:30.964 --> 25:33.009
[Halsey]
Just a word of warning.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.707
There'’s no telling
what kind of frightening

25:34.750 --> 25:37.579
and jumbled images might
emerge from your past.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.277
Remember, not
everything you recall

25:40.321 --> 25:42.628
is reflective
of real events.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.325
I understand.

25:44.368 --> 25:45.674
Okay.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.988
I'’m assembling
the visual data now.

26:04.737 --> 26:05.955
[John]
No.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.131
That table was over there.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.588
Dad'’s plant lab.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.208
Mom hung my drawings over here.

27:03.186 --> 27:04.884
My bedroom'’s this way.

27:04.927 --> 27:07.103
I remember.

27:07.147 --> 27:09.192
And what about in this room?

27:20.726 --> 27:22.771
[John]
Cortana...

27:22.815 --> 27:25.382
-I'’m not seeing it.
-[Cortana] I'’m sorry, John.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.733
I'’m afraid there's too much
destruction.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.430
I don'’t have enough data
on that space

27:29.473 --> 27:31.345
to make an accurate
representation.

27:31.388 --> 27:32.999
Perhaps if we go back
to the drawings, John.

27:33.042 --> 27:34.348
Hang on.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.354
[Young John, laughing]
Come on, Ellie.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.400
[giggling]

27:45.838 --> 27:47.404
Careful, Johnny!

27:47.448 --> 27:49.232
[laughing]

27:52.148 --> 27:53.280
[whispering]
Mom.

27:53.323 --> 27:55.151
[Father]
John, come here.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.457
Check this out.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.683
We'’re creating new life, John.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.730
Wow.

28:08.774 --> 28:12.821
And if the plants can live here,
then guess what?

28:12.865 --> 28:14.693
We can live here too.

28:17.434 --> 28:19.741
[Young John]
You smell like soap.

28:22.483 --> 28:26.443
[Mother] And you smell
like mud, goofball.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.054
Where were you
playing today, anyway?

28:28.097 --> 28:29.316
[Young John]
I don'’t know.

28:29.359 --> 28:32.101
-Just running around with Ellie.
-Yeah?

28:33.320 --> 28:34.495
Well, then I guess it'’s worth

28:34.538 --> 28:36.236
getting a little dirty for.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.890
Come on, let'’s get cleaned up
for dinner.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.416
[whines]

28:49.205 --> 28:51.338
Over here. Over here.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.756
[whispering]
What are you drawing?

29:26.503 --> 29:28.027
[Father]
Don'’t go too far, John.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.550
Be careful.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.421
Come on, Ellie.

29:39.908 --> 29:43.477
John, do you hear me?
I asked you what you'’re drawing.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.485
[whispering]
Can I see it?

30:07.240 --> 30:09.155
[barks]

30:09.198 --> 30:11.287
[Young John panting]

30:14.029 --> 30:15.465
[Ellie barks]

30:24.648 --> 30:25.606
[soft gasp]

30:52.198 --> 30:54.940
-Are you controlling this?
-I'’ve stopped projecting.

30:54.983 --> 30:57.072
Whatever he'’s seeing
isn'’t coming from me.

31:06.386 --> 31:07.996
[soft gasp]

31:09.215 --> 31:10.520
[Young John]
No, this one!

31:12.131 --> 31:13.959
[grunts]

31:15.221 --> 31:16.526
[barks]

31:24.752 --> 31:26.319
[Young John, laughing]
Heads.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.624
[coin being flicked]

31:32.020 --> 31:33.935
[birds tweeting]

31:39.419 --> 31:42.378
[Young Halsey] Correct again?
That'’s ten in a row.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.076
-Shall we try again?
-Yeah.

31:50.386 --> 31:51.605
Eagle up.

31:52.562 --> 31:53.737
[Halsey laughs]

31:53.781 --> 31:56.610
Well, aren'’t you
the lucky one?

31:58.612 --> 32:00.179
Do you know what I think?

32:02.094 --> 32:04.313
Actually, I think
I'’m the lucky one.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.185
Can I see you again?

32:06.228 --> 32:07.621
[Young John]
Sure.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.579
-Can it be our secret?
-Yes.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.718
[Halsey]
John, are you all right?

32:24.464 --> 32:26.596
[breathing heavily]

32:30.078 --> 32:32.472
[heavy footsteps]

32:40.262 --> 32:43.048
[machinery whirring]

32:49.706 --> 32:51.360
[Miranda]
That concludes testing

32:51.404 --> 32:53.101
on the three Spartans
and the artifact.

32:53.145 --> 32:56.539
Spartan 1-1-7 appears
to possess a unique quality

32:56.583 --> 32:58.454
not shared by the other
Spartans.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.456
Further testing,
perhaps on the level of DNA,

33:00.500 --> 33:02.241
will be needed in order
to determine--

33:02.284 --> 33:04.460
-[Kai] Oh, Riz, check this out.
-Whoa, whoa, Kai.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.549
It'’s my favorite
Covenant weapon.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.551
-Can you put that down, please?
-It'’s all right.

33:08.595 --> 33:10.162
See these holes
on the top plate?

33:10.205 --> 33:12.033
That'’s where the needle rounds
are primed.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.469
You pull the trigger,

33:13.513 --> 33:16.168
somehow they just know
how to target living tissue.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.170
[Vannak] As close as you get
to "fire and forget," ma'’am.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.693
[Kai] Soon as the needles
hit the target,

33:19.736 --> 33:22.304
they super-combine and bam,

33:22.348 --> 33:24.045
all you see
is a big pink mist

33:24.089 --> 33:26.526
of blood and evaporating
body fluids.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.745
-Massive damage.
-I know what a Needler is, Kai.

33:28.789 --> 33:31.052
Well, the Covenant
have another word for it.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.401
What is it again?

33:32.445 --> 33:34.534
-Qkhep'’os.
-[Kai] Oh, yeah, that'’s it.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.406
Qkhep'’os. Qkhep'os.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.581
[Vannak]
Correct.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.235
How-- How do you know that?

33:40.279 --> 33:42.150
[Kai] That'’s what they say
when we turn it on them.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.674
Though I guess
it could just mean,

33:44.718 --> 33:47.286
"Shit,
please don'’t kill me."

33:47.329 --> 33:48.765
Also correct.

33:48.809 --> 33:51.377
[Riz] Have you ever heard
a grunt beg for his life?

33:51.420 --> 33:52.726
[Vannak]
Pathetic.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.381
[Riz]
Kind of funny, actually.

33:55.424 --> 33:58.166
Oh, the Covenant
have the best tech.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.385
[Vannak]
No question.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.082
[computer chirps]

34:01.126 --> 34:04.129
[Kai] That Phantom we flew back
from Madrigal, that was unreal.

34:04.172 --> 34:07.262
Can you say that again?
The Covenant word for Needler.

34:07.306 --> 34:08.611
[Kai]
Qkhep'’os.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.178
[over recording]
Qkhep'’os.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.137
[chuckles]

34:14.182 --> 34:15.618
Of course.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.881
You Spartans have spent
more time with the Covenant

34:17.925 --> 34:19.666
than anyone.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.103
[Kai]
Ma'’am?

34:23.887 --> 34:26.281
What other Sangheili words
do you know?

34:33.506 --> 34:34.681
[Soren]
What the...?

34:34.724 --> 34:36.596
[distant indistinct shouting]

34:39.381 --> 34:41.166
Shit.

34:42.384 --> 34:45.083
Shit. Shit. Shit.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.349
What the hell are you doing?

34:50.392 --> 34:52.438
I'’m getting my ship
and going home.

34:52.481 --> 34:54.266
There'’s too many of them.

34:54.309 --> 34:55.919
Nah, there'’s just enough.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.486
You leave now,
you don'’t get paid.

34:57.530 --> 34:58.966
We had a deal.

34:59.009 --> 35:01.664
The deal was that I help you
find the resistance.

35:01.708 --> 35:02.926
We did that.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.667
They just got their asses
kicked by Vinsher,

35:04.711 --> 35:06.408
-thanks to you.
-No, no, no.

35:06.452 --> 35:07.670
There are people in Madrigal

35:07.714 --> 35:09.237
still loyal to
my dad, I know it!

35:09.281 --> 35:10.543
If we can get to them, I can
convince them to stand up--

35:10.586 --> 35:12.545
Kwan...

35:12.588 --> 35:14.677
no one'’s gonna step up.

35:14.721 --> 35:17.115
You need to face reality.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.553
There are no more heroes.

35:22.381 --> 35:23.556
My aunt.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.688
We need to see my aunt.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.865
She'’s the one who controls
the family money.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.651
I know where to find her.

35:31.694 --> 35:34.262
Has she got enough
to buy back my ship?

35:34.306 --> 35:35.655
Hmm?

35:35.698 --> 35:39.354
You leave now,
you go home with nothing.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.575
What kind of pirate are you?

35:43.489 --> 35:44.794
[scoffs]

35:55.979 --> 35:57.546
[Vinsher]
You'’re late.

35:57.590 --> 35:58.982
[blows]

35:59.026 --> 36:01.202
[Franco] My sister was late
to watch the kids.

36:02.725 --> 36:04.292
With what I pay you,

36:04.336 --> 36:06.903
you should invest
in proper childcare.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.297
Hello, Franco.

36:09.341 --> 36:10.907
You need me, Vinsher?

36:10.951 --> 36:12.692
Not me, my dear.

36:12.735 --> 36:15.216
The UNSC and the people
of Madrigal.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.479
Peace of our fair planet
is under threat

36:17.523 --> 36:19.307
by the arrival
of a troublemaker.

36:19.351 --> 36:20.743
An instigator.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.789
A rabble-rouser.

36:22.832 --> 36:27.533
I need her removed
before she rouses the rabble.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.187
Who?

36:31.276 --> 36:32.668
Kwan Ha.

36:33.582 --> 36:35.541
She'’s just a girl.

36:35.584 --> 36:38.370
Well, some girls grow up
to be trouble.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.981
She brought someone along
for protection.

36:42.548 --> 36:43.853
Soren.

36:45.420 --> 36:46.726
[Franco]
The pirate?

36:48.293 --> 36:49.816
He'’s nothing you can't handle.

36:51.426 --> 36:53.472
There'’s already
a bounty on her, yes?

36:53.515 --> 36:55.430
[Vinsher]
There'’s too much rebel blood

36:55.474 --> 36:57.519
running through this planet.

36:57.563 --> 37:00.870
The last thing I need
is another Ha martyr.

37:00.914 --> 37:03.221
This must be done quietly
and discreetly.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.875
This requires a professional.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.661
You want me to handle it.

37:14.057 --> 37:16.364
[woman]
What the hell are you--? No!

37:18.323 --> 37:19.411
[grunts]

37:23.937 --> 37:25.373
-[gun cocks]
-[Soojin] Enough!

37:28.550 --> 37:30.335
-Kwan.
-Aunt Soojin.

37:32.337 --> 37:33.512
I heard rumors.

37:33.555 --> 37:35.383
Let me look at you.

37:35.427 --> 37:36.906
Auntie, we need your help.

37:36.950 --> 37:39.866
Kwan, you should not
have returned.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.694
Come with me quickly.

37:41.737 --> 37:42.956
You mustn'’t be seen.

37:42.999 --> 37:46.742
I'’ve worked very hard for this.

37:47.874 --> 37:49.789
I'’ve paid my dues.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.834
Played all the angles.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.749
It'’s my time.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.805
Fix this for me, Franco.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.808
I need to clean my ledger.

38:18.600 --> 38:19.688
In here.

38:22.691 --> 38:24.040
Stop.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.564
Are you sure you want
to go through

38:25.607 --> 38:27.043
all that embarrassment again?

38:27.087 --> 38:29.959
It'’s okay, Soren.
I'’m safe with Aunt Soojin.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.093
You get the money.

38:33.136 --> 38:36.444
I'’m gonna go see a man
about a ship.

38:43.016 --> 38:45.148
[Miranda]
Six new alien intonations.

38:45.192 --> 38:48.891
Dozens of phonemes, logograms.

38:48.935 --> 38:50.763
I can'’t believe
we didn'’t do this years ago.

38:50.806 --> 38:52.373
Well, due respect, ma'’am,

38:52.417 --> 38:54.375
this is the first
you'’ve spoken a word to us.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.986
Well, my mother
never let me near you.

38:57.030 --> 39:00.642
I always used to wonder
why she preferred you over me.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.123
I probably thought it was
'’cause you were more fun.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.343
That must have been
difficult for you.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.827
Uh, anyway, um...

39:11.871 --> 39:15.918
I'’m not getting a sense that fun
was a part of your training.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.920
-[Kai] Oh, we had fun.
-Oh, yeah?

39:17.964 --> 39:20.880
At one point
we were each given pets.

39:20.923 --> 39:23.535
I had a puppy. Cody.

39:23.578 --> 39:26.407
-Riz, you had a cat.
-Eloise.

39:27.539 --> 39:28.627
You'’re kidding.

39:28.670 --> 39:31.412
Vannak, you had a pig.

39:31.456 --> 39:32.587
-Ivan.
-Ivan.

39:32.631 --> 39:34.676
Ivan the Terrible.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.810
See, we were studying
the strategies of the wolf pack.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.942
And Dr. Halsey would make teams.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.597
The hunted
and the hunters.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.425
Sounds like a blast.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.166
[Kai]
Two days in the woods,

39:46.209 --> 39:48.864
tracking, eating whatever
you could find,

39:48.908 --> 39:51.127
and stalking
and killing your prey.

39:51.171 --> 39:53.869
Whichever side failed
lost their pets.

39:54.957 --> 39:56.742
What, she took them
away from you?

39:56.785 --> 39:59.527
No. She had us eliminate them.

40:02.617 --> 40:03.836
[scoffs]
Come on.

40:03.879 --> 40:06.491
Every failure carries
consequences.

40:06.534 --> 40:09.624
I was on the winning side
nine times before I lost.

40:09.668 --> 40:11.757
I failed on my third mission.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.585
[Vannak]
I never lost.

40:13.628 --> 40:16.588
So you got to keep Ivan.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.894
Dr. Halsey eliminated it.

40:18.938 --> 40:21.854
Spartans must be bonded
to one another,

40:21.897 --> 40:23.508
and nothing else.

40:38.261 --> 40:41.830
I warned you triggering memories
from your past

40:41.874 --> 40:43.963
would destabilize you.

40:44.006 --> 40:46.879
I'’m now concerned that...

40:46.922 --> 40:48.533
that you'’re having visions

40:48.576 --> 40:50.926
even when you'’re not
in the presence of the artifact.

40:50.970 --> 40:53.102
We need to get you home

40:53.146 --> 40:54.800
so we can study
the drawings--

40:54.843 --> 40:56.976
[John]
I saw you.

40:58.325 --> 41:00.240
I was a boy.

41:00.283 --> 41:02.024
And you were with me.

41:03.243 --> 41:05.898
-Of course I was with you--
-[John] No.

41:05.941 --> 41:08.553
Not at the orphanage. Here.

41:08.596 --> 41:09.858
In my house.

41:09.902 --> 41:12.078
My parents
were still alive.

41:14.950 --> 41:16.865
Why were you here?

41:16.909 --> 41:18.040
It'’s natural.

41:18.084 --> 41:19.564
Memories get muddled,

41:19.607 --> 41:21.609
particularly where
trauma'’s involved.

41:21.653 --> 41:27.006
You were so young when we met,
and so overwhelmed with grief.

41:27.049 --> 41:29.530
I took care of you.

41:30.966 --> 41:34.013
I have been with you ever since,

41:34.056 --> 41:36.232
and I am still here
for you now.

41:51.857 --> 41:53.728
[indistinct chatter]

42:08.177 --> 42:10.702
-Well?
-Bad news, friend.

42:10.745 --> 42:12.573
What do you mean, bad news?

42:12.617 --> 42:15.271
I mean, how much could they
possibly want for my ship?

42:15.315 --> 42:17.273
Money isn'’t the problem.

42:17.317 --> 42:18.927
Your ship'’s scrapped.

42:18.971 --> 42:22.714
Guts ripped out, wings already
on their way to Sedra.

42:22.757 --> 42:24.716
Those filthy animals.

42:24.759 --> 42:27.283
If you'’re looking for
the fastest way off Madrigal,

42:27.327 --> 42:30.939
transport ships take off
every night for New Carthage

42:30.983 --> 42:33.246
at 11:00 Local Mean
Solar Time.

42:34.769 --> 42:36.292
Where do these ships
take off from?

42:36.336 --> 42:40.209
Granada, 200 miles due south.

42:42.385 --> 42:44.692
-Two hundred miles?
-Through the desert.

42:44.736 --> 42:48.217
For the, uh, right price
I can take you there.

42:51.656 --> 42:53.745
Hmm.

42:54.963 --> 42:56.225
That'’s a nice lid.

42:57.487 --> 42:59.707
Real stylish.

43:04.973 --> 43:07.106
I'’ll take the bike too.

43:10.675 --> 43:13.112
Dad started with only
50 fighters.

43:13.155 --> 43:15.810
We can find at least that many,
and with the family'’s money--

43:15.854 --> 43:17.638
There is nothing left, Kwan.

43:17.682 --> 43:20.336
Your father spent everything
we had on the revolution.

43:20.380 --> 43:22.817
And when the money ran out,
so did the people.

43:22.861 --> 43:25.864
They'’re scared
and they'’re desperate,

43:25.907 --> 43:27.169
but we can beat Vinsher.

43:27.213 --> 43:28.431
The people just need
to be reminded

43:28.475 --> 43:30.782
of what they were
fighting for.

43:30.825 --> 43:33.915
Come. My men will get you
out of town safely

43:33.959 --> 43:35.351
and you will stay far away--

43:35.395 --> 43:37.789
I can'’t let him down.

43:37.832 --> 43:39.094
He died to save me.

43:39.138 --> 43:40.792
I have to pick up
where he left off.

43:40.835 --> 43:42.968
No! I will not allow it.

43:43.011 --> 43:44.926
I can fight just as he did.

43:44.970 --> 43:47.146
Your father
fought for a lie!

43:48.190 --> 43:50.149
What are you talking about?

43:52.847 --> 43:56.285
I never wanted to ruin your
father'’s image in your heart.

43:57.809 --> 43:59.114
Tell me.

44:02.291 --> 44:05.251
Years ago,
before the war,

44:05.294 --> 44:07.819
your father visited
a group in the desert.

44:09.385 --> 44:10.778
Mystics.

44:10.822 --> 44:13.868
When he returned,

44:13.912 --> 44:15.696
everything was different.

44:15.740 --> 44:17.132
[grunts]

44:18.003 --> 44:19.265
He was different.

44:20.266 --> 44:22.007
What did they tell him?

44:22.050 --> 44:24.009
He never said.

44:24.052 --> 44:27.708
But he returned convinced
it was his responsibility

44:27.752 --> 44:29.275
to free Madrigal.

44:29.318 --> 44:31.843
He told me it was the only way
for the Ha family'’s

44:31.886 --> 44:33.714
true purpose to be revealed.

44:33.758 --> 44:35.107
What true purpose?

44:35.150 --> 44:38.719
Our real reason
for being on Madrigal,

44:38.763 --> 44:40.329
and the reason we fight,

44:40.373 --> 44:43.158
according to the desert people.

44:44.159 --> 44:45.813
And he believed them.

44:45.857 --> 44:48.860
Your father believed
what he wanted to believe.

44:50.035 --> 44:52.037
Where can I find these mystics?

44:52.080 --> 44:53.778
-Kwan, no.
-[thud]

44:55.214 --> 44:56.781
What was that?

45:01.481 --> 45:03.091
Kwan, go!

45:03.135 --> 45:05.006
[grunts]

45:05.050 --> 45:06.399
Hello, Kwan.

45:06.442 --> 45:07.748
[panting]

45:07.792 --> 45:08.923
What are you doing here?

45:08.967 --> 45:10.403
Cleaning up
your father'’s mess.

45:10.446 --> 45:12.753
As usual.
Where'’s your friend?

45:14.146 --> 45:17.062
-[shouts]
-[grunts]

45:17.105 --> 45:19.064
Aunt Soojin!

45:19.107 --> 45:21.240
-No!
-[blood splatters]

45:22.807 --> 45:24.199
[Soren]
Hey!

45:29.161 --> 45:30.510
[grunts]

45:33.905 --> 45:36.734
[sobbing]
Aunt Soojin.

45:37.647 --> 45:40.433
Shit! Never should have
left the Rubble.

45:40.476 --> 45:42.130
[bullet casings clatter]

45:42.174 --> 45:44.176
Cost me my ship too.
Come on.

45:44.219 --> 45:48.876
We'’re about to have Vinsher's
entire army on our ass.

45:52.140 --> 45:54.012
[crying]

45:54.055 --> 45:55.274
Come on.

45:55.317 --> 45:56.579
Let'’s go.

45:59.234 --> 46:01.323
[indistinct chattering]

46:03.499 --> 46:04.979
-[gunshots]
-Stay down!

46:05.023 --> 46:06.328
[screams and shouts]

46:13.945 --> 46:15.250
Go! Go! Go!

46:15.294 --> 46:17.862
[engine revs]

46:17.905 --> 46:19.994
[automatic gunfire]

46:20.038 --> 46:21.822
[indistinct shouting]

46:21.866 --> 46:23.519
[woman screams]

46:36.315 --> 46:38.404
-Behind you.
-[gunshot]

46:38.447 --> 46:39.535
Go!

46:45.933 --> 46:47.021
Dr. Halsey.

46:48.196 --> 46:49.894
[Adun grunts]

46:49.937 --> 46:52.853
Cortana'’s analysis of
Master Chief'’s brain scans

46:52.897 --> 46:54.159
from earlier today.

46:54.202 --> 46:56.117
Hmm.

46:56.161 --> 46:57.989
I mean, you were right.

46:58.032 --> 47:01.601
He'’s reopened neural clusters
in his amygdala.

47:04.517 --> 47:06.954
Yeah, emotions mixed
with memory.

47:06.998 --> 47:08.173
Yeah.

47:08.216 --> 47:10.349
And it'’s impossible to determine

47:10.392 --> 47:12.568
what'’s hidden
in any given neural cluster,

47:12.612 --> 47:15.528
so there'’s no way of knowing
exactly what he remembered.

47:15.571 --> 47:17.269
[footsteps approaching]

47:20.968 --> 47:22.927
[John]
I remember.

47:24.493 --> 47:26.495
The second object is here...

47:27.453 --> 47:29.020
on Eridanus.

47:30.412 --> 47:31.936
And I know where it is.

47:40.335 --> 47:43.251
[engine revs]

47:47.429 --> 47:51.085
[garbled voices speaking
Sangheili over computer]

47:53.348 --> 47:55.263
[Kai]
Stop it right there.

47:55.307 --> 47:57.526
Yeah, what--
what do you have for that?

47:57.570 --> 47:59.964
At first I had "foundation,"

48:00.007 --> 48:02.967
but that other syllable
changes it, doesn'’t it?

48:03.010 --> 48:04.142
[Kai]
Yeah.

48:04.185 --> 48:05.926
Oq-- Oq'’ogakha.

48:05.970 --> 48:08.407
It'’s, uh,
"keystone," maybe?

48:09.277 --> 48:11.018
[Miranda] Could that
be the artifact?

48:11.062 --> 48:14.282
Do you have access
to the HUD data from the cave?

48:14.326 --> 48:16.545
Yeah, um, hold on.

48:16.589 --> 48:18.634
[computer chirping]

48:21.246 --> 48:23.596
You haven'’t been completely
honest with me.

48:27.208 --> 48:28.949
What-- What do you mean?

48:30.995 --> 48:32.344
My hair.

48:32.387 --> 48:33.998
It'’s awful.

48:35.086 --> 48:37.044
-[laughs] No.
-I just don'’t know

48:37.088 --> 48:38.611
what came over me.

48:38.654 --> 48:42.049
A small act of rebellion,
maybe, against Halsey.

48:42.093 --> 48:44.965
Well, against
a lot of things, maybe.

48:45.009 --> 48:46.488
[laughs]

48:46.532 --> 48:48.969
[John, over video]
Retrieving now.

48:57.456 --> 48:59.110
[garbled voice speaks Sangheili]

48:59.153 --> 49:00.502
-Wow.
-What?

49:00.546 --> 49:03.592
This word, from the Sangheili
broadcast.

49:03.636 --> 49:05.638
Ch'’anggagomo.

49:08.162 --> 49:10.208
I have "sacred ring."

49:10.251 --> 49:11.557
Look.

49:13.124 --> 49:14.386
Sacred ring.

49:16.475 --> 49:18.564
"Halo."

49:24.352 --> 49:27.312
Do you think that'’s what
the Covenant are talking about?

49:27.355 --> 49:29.270
Uh...

49:29.314 --> 49:32.404
I know that you report
directly to Halsey, but...

49:32.447 --> 49:35.537
can we just keep this
between us?

49:35.581 --> 49:38.062
At least for now, until
I figure out what all this--

49:38.105 --> 49:39.150
Yeah, no problem.

49:40.629 --> 49:42.370
It'’s our secret.

49:42.414 --> 49:45.286
You know, the way I see it,

49:45.330 --> 49:48.028
we'’re sort of like sisters.

49:48.072 --> 49:49.247
[chuckles]

49:49.290 --> 49:51.727
I gotta say,
Petty Officer...

49:53.164 --> 49:55.427
there'’s something
very odd about you.

49:56.558 --> 49:58.038
Ma'’am?

50:00.084 --> 50:01.520
[Miranda]
Dr. Halsey designed everything

50:01.563 --> 50:03.130
to her specifications.

50:04.610 --> 50:07.395
When her creations
behave in unexpected ways,

50:07.439 --> 50:09.615
she gets uncomfortable.

50:11.356 --> 50:15.621
Well, what does it mean
to behave in unexpected ways?

50:16.665 --> 50:18.798
Like a human...

50:18.841 --> 50:20.147
I suppose.

50:23.194 --> 50:26.327
To Dr. Halsey,
human beings are messy,

50:26.371 --> 50:28.199
irrational, chaotic.

50:28.242 --> 50:32.768
They make decisions
based on emotion, passion.

50:44.432 --> 50:47.131
Halsey is different.

50:47.174 --> 50:48.871
She sees the world
as a set of data

50:48.915 --> 50:50.743
to be optimized, regardless

50:50.786 --> 50:53.702
of the short-term pain
or sacrifice.

50:59.969 --> 51:01.667
Next to this level
of dedication,

51:01.710 --> 51:03.843
the rest of us
ultimately fall short.

51:10.676 --> 51:13.287
And when people let her down,

51:13.331 --> 51:16.638
Dr. Halsey has a way
of cutting them

51:16.682 --> 51:18.510
out of her life.

51:18.553 --> 51:21.513
But Halsey never stops.

51:21.556 --> 51:23.341
She just keeps pushing forward,

51:23.384 --> 51:26.735
determined to bend us towards
her vision of the future.

51:27.867 --> 51:29.869
She'’s convinced
there'’s something out there

51:29.912 --> 51:31.871
just beyond our reach.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.658
An answer to our
eternal questions.

51:36.702 --> 51:38.443
Who are we?

51:38.486 --> 51:41.315
Where are we heading?
What is our true potential?

51:51.499 --> 51:54.633
She'’s dedicated her life's work
to finding those answers.

51:56.809 --> 51:58.854
And she'’ll never give up...

52:00.943 --> 52:02.815
no matter the cost.

52:04.295 --> 52:08.168
Kai, your act of rebellion
could just be a glitch.

52:12.694 --> 52:14.696
But if I know Dr. Halsey...

52:24.924 --> 52:27.361
she doesn'’t tolerate glitches.

52:31.626 --> 52:35.674
