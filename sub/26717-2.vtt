00:00.001 --> 00:01.453
Previously on "Midnight, Texas"...

00:01.456 --> 00:03.189
I'm Patience Lucero.

00:03.192 --> 00:05.223
My husband, Kai, and I own the hotel.

00:05.226 --> 00:07.872
Healer Kai has a huge following

00:07.875 --> 00:08.867
of the desperate.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.286
This whole psychic connection

00:11.289 --> 00:12.491
doesn't suck.

00:12.494 --> 00:14.590
The hotel will be out of
business in three months.

00:14.593 --> 00:16.856
- Ghosts.
- I've had too much fear.

00:16.859 --> 00:18.528
Kai can't just kiss it better.

00:18.531 --> 00:21.134
I have to leave Midnight,
and I have to do it alone.

00:21.136 --> 00:22.568
I love you.

00:22.570 --> 00:24.765
- Then let me go.
- I know you?

00:24.768 --> 00:25.939
Name's Walr.

00:25.941 --> 00:28.074
Demon hunter.

00:28.076 --> 00:30.747
Welcome home.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.545
I will avenge you.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:59.174 --> 01:00.907
Ah.

01:08.550 --> 01:10.616
All right.

01:10.618 --> 01:12.218
Close your eyes.

01:33.406 --> 01:35.608
The pain's gone.

01:37.980 --> 01:40.780
I've been to every
specialist in four states.

01:42.751 --> 01:44.984
How did you do that?

01:44.986 --> 01:46.686
Glad I could help.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.140
Fine, Kai saved Manfred

01:50.143 --> 01:51.858
and we're all grateful.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.559
I guess.

01:53.561 --> 01:56.062
But the guy was talking to a painting.

01:56.064 --> 01:57.426
I mean, that is weird.

01:57.429 --> 01:59.399
You sleep with a dead man.

01:59.401 --> 02:01.229
We all have our quirks.

02:01.232 --> 02:02.832
Isn't that what Midnight's all about?

02:15.116 --> 02:16.482
It's late.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.584
I'm gonna go home.

02:21.723 --> 02:23.923
It's okay to miss her.

02:25.894 --> 02:27.727
I'm fine.

02:27.729 --> 02:29.395
Really.

03:28.223 --> 03:29.355
Someone's in trouble.

03:29.357 --> 03:30.606
I need to get in their room.

03:35.330 --> 03:37.090
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. I'm confused.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.673
Ghosts are real. Your hotel is haunted.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.873
Well, I know that ghosts are
real, but you can see them?

03:40.875 --> 03:42.512
Unfortunately, yes. Here, this one.

03:42.515 --> 03:44.103
Quickly.

03:51.179 --> 03:52.578
Come on.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.512
- Damn it, he's gone.
- I don't understand.

03:54.515 --> 03:56.249
Ghosts can't kill people.

03:57.719 --> 04:00.332
This one can.

04:00.335 --> 04:05.224

04:09.430 --> 04:11.164
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:11.166 --> 04:14.270
Uh, they'll do an autopsy,
but it looks like he slipped

04:14.273 --> 04:16.089
and knocked himself
unconscious and drowned.

04:16.093 --> 04:17.503
That's not what happened.

04:17.505 --> 04:19.184
It was a ghost. I saw her.

04:19.187 --> 04:20.786
I thought ghosts
couldn't touch anything,

04:20.789 --> 04:22.308
much less hurt someone.

04:22.310 --> 04:23.709
No, the older and angrier they are,

04:23.711 --> 04:25.344
- the stronger they get.
- All right, look,

04:25.346 --> 04:26.784
we need to get everyone out of here.

04:26.786 --> 04:27.666
- No.
- Kai...

04:27.669 --> 04:28.932
No, we can't afford to shut down

04:28.934 --> 04:30.016
three days after we open.

04:30.018 --> 04:31.384
Well, someone else could die.

04:31.386 --> 04:32.919
Well, I've only seen the
ghost in the one room.

04:32.921 --> 04:34.954
She must be tethered there, which means

04:34.956 --> 04:36.715
- the other guests are safe.
- Oh, so, what,

04:36.718 --> 04:38.791
we just leave that
room empty indefinitely?

04:38.793 --> 04:41.794
No, I'll do a little digging,

04:41.796 --> 04:43.752
find out what her
unfinished business is,

04:43.755 --> 04:45.498
get her to move on.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.699
Yeah.

04:46.701 --> 04:48.501
All right, thank you.

04:48.503 --> 04:49.635
Least I can do.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.204
You saved my life.

04:54.042 --> 04:55.641
Ooh.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.109
Any idea what happened?

04:57.111 --> 04:58.644
No.

04:58.646 --> 05:02.348
And they were fine yesterday.

05:02.350 --> 05:03.950
Well, that could be part

05:03.952 --> 05:06.619
of the problem: fan's off.

05:06.621 --> 05:08.688
Oh.

05:08.691 --> 05:10.650
You know, the last time
things started dying

05:10.653 --> 05:12.080
around here, it was Colconnar.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.827
We defeated Colconnar.

05:14.829 --> 05:16.996
The veil is closed.

05:16.998 --> 05:20.099
Bobo!

05:20.101 --> 05:21.595
- You okay?
- Yeah.

05:21.598 --> 05:23.536
Weird.

05:23.538 --> 05:25.103
Uh, I didn't do anything.

05:25.106 --> 05:27.607
It just started up.

05:27.609 --> 05:29.542
Even if it isn't Colconnar,

05:29.544 --> 05:32.011
it could still be something demonic.

05:32.013 --> 05:33.446
Or...

05:33.448 --> 05:35.648
could be blight.

05:35.650 --> 05:37.517
That's something that
kills plants, right?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.552
Yes.

05:40.788 --> 05:42.421
We'll get to the bottom of this.

05:42.423 --> 05:44.757
Try not to obsess, okay?

05:44.759 --> 05:46.225
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:47.362 --> 05:48.861
I gotta get to work.

05:48.863 --> 05:50.056
All right.

05:54.502 --> 05:56.636
I think I know who she is.

05:56.638 --> 05:58.404
This her?

05:59.874 --> 06:01.507
- Yeah.
- That's Carolyn Baker

06:01.509 --> 06:02.808
and her husband, Bruce.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.580
They bought the hotel back in the '50s.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.245
How'd she die?

06:06.247 --> 06:08.381
Fell in the bathtub and drowned.

06:08.383 --> 06:10.111
Just like our guest.

06:10.114 --> 06:12.518
She's re-creating her own death.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.520
What happened to her husband?

06:14.522 --> 06:16.555
I've never seen a man so broken.

06:16.557 --> 06:18.424
He closed up the hotel and moved away.

06:18.426 --> 06:19.925
- I don't know where.
- You know,

06:19.927 --> 06:22.595
before we remodeled, that
was the owner's suite.

06:22.597 --> 06:24.797
- They must have lived there.
- Makes sense.

06:24.799 --> 06:27.433
She's trapped where she died.

06:27.435 --> 06:29.223
Oh, they looked so happy.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.839
And then he lost her in an instant.

06:45.653 --> 06:47.687
Whoo!

06:53.161 --> 06:55.428
Hey, beautiful. Let me buy you a drink.

06:56.564 --> 06:59.332
Turn around and walk away.

06:59.334 --> 07:01.701
Hey, I'm new in town.

07:01.703 --> 07:04.570
Can you give me some
directions to, uh...

07:04.572 --> 07:08.040
your bedroom?

07:08.042 --> 07:10.276
Guys, I love this top.

07:10.278 --> 07:12.111
Don't make me get your blood on it.

07:12.113 --> 07:13.913
Whoa, hey.

07:13.915 --> 07:15.381
Hey, we just want to talk.

07:15.383 --> 07:17.650
Let's go someplace a
little quieter, huh?

07:17.652 --> 07:18.984
You know what?

07:18.986 --> 07:20.353
Yeah.

07:20.355 --> 07:23.055
Let's go somewhere a little more, um...

07:23.057 --> 07:26.058
- private.
- She's not interested.

07:26.060 --> 07:28.887
Jesus Christ!

07:30.865 --> 07:32.622
What the hell was that?

07:32.625 --> 07:34.300
They were bothering
you. I could feel it.

07:34.302 --> 07:37.303
I can handle a couple of drunk townies.

07:37.305 --> 07:38.838
I couldn't help myself.

07:41.342 --> 07:43.008
It's okay.

07:43.010 --> 07:47.012
Look, I'm used to
doing things for myself.

07:47.014 --> 07:48.252
But we're married now,

07:48.255 --> 07:50.349
and this whole thing...

07:50.351 --> 07:51.983
That's what couples do, right?

07:51.984 --> 07:54.520
They help each other out.

07:55.590 --> 07:57.022
Okay.

07:57.024 --> 07:59.158
I'll get used to it.

08:02.096 --> 08:03.487
I saw your fangs.

08:03.490 --> 08:05.189
- You're a vampire.
- Trick of the light.

08:05.192 --> 08:07.310
I knew it. I knew vampires were real.

08:07.313 --> 08:08.746
I've read "Twilight" seven times...

08:08.749 --> 08:10.916
- Well, the good parts.
- Why don't you head home

08:10.919 --> 08:12.236
and make it an even eight?

08:12.239 --> 08:13.839
Will you turn me?

08:13.841 --> 08:16.140
There's no such thing as vampires.

08:16.143 --> 08:18.344
And trust me, you don't want to be

08:18.346 --> 08:19.431
anything like me.

08:24.352 --> 08:26.151
No matter what you hear, don't come in.

08:26.153 --> 08:28.080
- I'll be fine.
- Because the salt

08:28.083 --> 08:30.789
- will protect you?
- Exactly.

08:30.791 --> 08:32.892
Ghosts can't cross a salt barrier.

08:32.894 --> 08:34.126
Wait here.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.679
Carolyn?

08:55.149 --> 08:57.750
Carolyn Baker, show yourself.

09:03.858 --> 09:06.117
Come on, you know you can't hurt me.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.973
I just want to talk.

09:10.976 --> 09:13.249
Please, get out of here.

09:13.252 --> 09:15.367
Carolyn, I know your death

09:15.369 --> 09:17.770
was tragic and senseless,

09:17.773 --> 09:20.072
but you can't take it
out on innocent people.

09:20.074 --> 09:22.474
What, you think I drowned that man?

09:28.882 --> 09:30.515
He's here.

09:30.518 --> 09:33.018
He killed me, and he'll kill you too.

09:34.422 --> 09:36.617
- Who are you talking about?
- My husband.

09:36.620 --> 09:39.321
Stay away from my wife!

09:57.756 --> 09:59.957
Manfred?

10:04.563 --> 10:06.029
Thanks for not listening to me.

10:06.031 --> 10:07.498
Oh, I never listen.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.199
Just ask my husband.

10:10.603 --> 10:12.369
No, it's okay.

10:12.371 --> 10:14.238
It's okay. We're safe.

10:16.976 --> 10:19.724
I-I take it Carolyn's not moving on?

10:19.727 --> 10:21.545
Carolyn's not the problem.

10:21.547 --> 10:24.060
- It's the husband, Bruce.
- I thought that Bruce

10:24.063 --> 10:25.749
sold the hotel and moved away.

10:25.751 --> 10:28.952
Looks like he... he drowned
her and then he shot himself.

10:28.954 --> 10:30.487
What?

10:30.489 --> 10:32.523
Well, can you convince him to move on?

10:32.525 --> 10:34.258
Doesn't exactly look like

10:34.260 --> 10:36.793
the "find peace, walk
toward the light" kind.

10:36.795 --> 10:39.096
I think we need a new plan.

10:41.567 --> 10:44.134
You don't want to be kissing me.

10:44.136 --> 10:46.637
No, I'm just tired.

10:47.627 --> 10:49.256
- You're lying.
- So?

10:49.259 --> 10:52.709
Lies are the foundation of
every happy relationship.

10:52.711 --> 10:54.077
Back at the bar,

10:54.079 --> 10:56.146
I was trying to help.

10:56.148 --> 10:58.064
I know. You're perfect.

10:58.067 --> 10:59.365
You anticipate my every need.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.518
Only a total bitch would be angry.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.686
But you know what?

11:02.688 --> 11:04.321
I'm a total bitch.

11:04.323 --> 11:06.123
- I'm aware.
- Hey.

11:08.227 --> 11:11.461
There has to be a way
to sever this connection.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.564
There is one.

11:13.566 --> 11:15.866
I turn you into a vampire.

11:15.868 --> 11:17.866
You really want to
have that fight again?

11:19.305 --> 11:21.438
No, we barely survived the last time.

11:24.910 --> 11:26.610
I...

11:26.612 --> 11:29.479
I just need you to back off.

11:35.621 --> 11:36.887
Ooh.

11:36.889 --> 11:39.856
You pawned this in 1937.

11:39.858 --> 11:42.659
Never thought I'd need it again.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.528
What is it?

11:44.530 --> 11:45.762
Keepsake.

11:45.764 --> 11:46.860
Thanks.

11:46.863 --> 11:49.198
Oh, a guy named Walker called
the bar looking for you.

11:49.201 --> 11:52.102
I gave him your cell. Hope that's okay.

11:52.104 --> 11:54.308
- Um...
- I'm sorry, man.

11:54.311 --> 11:55.405
He knew you were an angel.

11:55.407 --> 11:57.674
I just assumed you guys were friends.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.109
No, it's fine.

11:59.111 --> 12:01.311
Um, thanks.

12:02.427 --> 12:04.394
- Hi.
- Hi. You were right.

12:04.397 --> 12:06.316
- Hey, babe.
- Colconnar didn't kill

12:06.318 --> 12:07.358
my plants.

12:07.361 --> 12:09.186
I've also ruled out pixie infestation

12:09.188 --> 12:10.554
and overwatering.

12:10.556 --> 12:12.824
Well, that's great, right?

12:12.827 --> 12:14.660
Well, plants don't just die.

12:14.663 --> 12:17.094
Well, in my experience, they do.

12:17.096 --> 12:19.997
Remember when I told you not to obsess?

12:19.999 --> 12:22.266
Yeah.

12:22.268 --> 12:24.368
It just didn't work out.

12:24.370 --> 12:28.238
Maybe I can help get your mind off it.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.207
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

12:43.022 --> 12:44.454
You're right.

12:44.456 --> 12:46.503
I need to stop obsessing.

12:46.506 --> 12:48.592
And I really should get back

12:48.594 --> 12:49.926
- to the shop.
- Mm.

12:49.928 --> 12:51.728
- Don't wait up.
- Huh?

12:51.730 --> 12:52.979
I got a shift at the bar later.

12:52.982 --> 12:55.078
Ugh. Do you ever feel like
you have too many jobs?

12:55.081 --> 12:57.401
No. You want me to stay home?

12:57.403 --> 13:00.003
Be a kept man?

13:00.005 --> 13:02.939
That wouldn't be so bad.

13:08.447 --> 13:10.981
Are you okay?

13:10.983 --> 13:12.482
That was, uh...

13:12.484 --> 13:13.817
close.

13:13.819 --> 13:16.653
The plants, the fan
this morning, now this.

13:16.655 --> 13:18.844
Whatever's happening is supernatural.

13:18.847 --> 13:20.390
- Feej...
- Bobo, something is trying

13:20.392 --> 13:21.858
to hurt you!

13:23.456 --> 13:25.523
The guests are talking.
We need the spirits gone.

13:25.526 --> 13:27.726
Well, there is a spell that
makes an entire building

13:27.729 --> 13:29.099
- inhospitable to the dead.
- No.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.500
If we perform it on the hotel...

13:30.502 --> 13:32.302
Kai... Kai, darling,
at least think about it.

13:32.305 --> 13:33.436
There's nothing to think about.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.037
I need balance to do my work.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.640
Life cannot exist without death.

13:36.642 --> 13:39.242
Energy has to flow. No
dead zones and no vacuums.

13:39.244 --> 13:41.229
Well, then I'm out of ideas.

13:41.232 --> 13:42.753
We need the big guns.

13:42.756 --> 13:45.948
- We need Fiji.
- Fiji's the big guns?

13:45.951 --> 13:47.684
She's cuter than a bug's ear.

13:47.686 --> 13:49.820
Agreed.

13:49.822 --> 13:51.688
But don't piss her off.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.218
Why don't I do that?

14:03.221 --> 14:04.788
Don't you think you're taking this

14:04.791 --> 14:07.758
- just a little bit too far?
- I'm just being cautious.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.306
Whiskey.

14:09.308 --> 14:11.007
Double.

14:11.009 --> 14:13.577
Since when did you start drinking?

14:15.113 --> 14:16.980
Since I got married.

14:18.584 --> 14:20.116
You'll get through it.

14:20.118 --> 14:22.219
You and Olivia...

14:22.221 --> 14:24.054
you're forever.

14:26.158 --> 14:27.518
That's just it...

14:27.521 --> 14:29.052
We're not.

14:29.055 --> 14:31.723
Can I buy you a drink?

14:31.726 --> 14:34.029
You bet your britches you can.

14:39.605 --> 14:41.304
Seat's taken.

14:41.306 --> 14:43.707
I want to apologize for last night.

14:43.709 --> 14:46.710
I shouldn't have asked
you to turn me into a...

14:46.712 --> 14:47.777
Vampire.

14:47.779 --> 14:49.813
There's no such thing.

14:49.815 --> 14:51.047
Trick of the light.

14:51.049 --> 14:53.350
Got it.

14:53.352 --> 14:54.751
Hey!

14:54.753 --> 14:57.287
- I need 300 bucks.
- For what?

14:57.289 --> 14:59.055
- Merch.
- No.

14:59.058 --> 15:01.041
You know I'm saving for nursing school.

15:01.044 --> 15:02.453
Yeah, you and every other stripper.

15:02.456 --> 15:04.127
I'm good with people.

15:04.796 --> 15:06.396
Spend your own money.

15:06.398 --> 15:08.026
Wait, you don't have any.

15:08.029 --> 15:09.282
Well, at least I don't go shaking...

15:09.284 --> 15:11.535
Hey. End this here.

15:11.537 --> 15:13.803
No problem.

15:13.805 --> 15:15.572
You can find your own ride home.

15:20.850 --> 15:22.878
Sorry about my boyfriend.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.381
He's a real dick.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.751
Rough day?

15:29.054 --> 15:31.755
I had an interview at Crystal Desert,

15:31.757 --> 15:34.430
but the man there didn't
even give me a chance.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.160
He looked at me like I was stupid.

15:37.162 --> 15:40.330
- I'm not stupid.
- Of course you're not.

15:40.332 --> 15:42.232
Rickie says I'm not classy enough

15:42.234 --> 15:44.601
for a place like that, anyway.

15:44.603 --> 15:45.735
What do you think?

15:45.737 --> 15:48.038
Is this top inappropriate?

15:48.040 --> 15:49.964
I think you look lovely.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.441
Thanks.

15:51.443 --> 15:53.937
I guess it's back to
the Boobie Trap for me.

15:53.940 --> 15:55.478
There'll be other jobs.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.248
It just seemed so perfect.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.516
I want to be a nurse.

15:59.518 --> 16:01.284
It's a healing center.

16:01.286 --> 16:03.687
I was sure I was gonna get it.

16:03.689 --> 16:06.823
- Guess Rickie was right.
- Just met the guy,

16:06.825 --> 16:09.092
but I'm pretty confident
he's never been right

16:09.094 --> 16:10.760
about anything.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.996
Hey, Lem, you mind closing up?

16:12.998 --> 16:14.698
No problem.

16:15.567 --> 16:18.568
So I did find a protection potion.

16:18.570 --> 16:21.771
Or I can use one of those
inflatable sumo suits.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.206
Couldn't hurt.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.376
Mm.

16:26.378 --> 16:28.411
Witches first.

16:28.413 --> 16:30.113
If you want to wait, I'll close up

16:30.115 --> 16:32.248
and I can see you safely home.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.050
I don't know much

16:34.052 --> 16:36.519
about silver poisoning...

16:36.521 --> 16:39.522
but I don't think you'll be
in any condition to drive.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.667
Finally, you're awake.

16:50.669 --> 16:52.902
Oh, you... you drugged me.

16:52.904 --> 16:56.072
- Why?
- I needed to...

16:56.074 --> 16:57.607
lower your inhibitions

16:57.609 --> 16:59.576
so you'd do what I wanted.

17:02.614 --> 17:03.980
Hey, Daddy.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.615
No.

17:08.165 --> 17:12.136
So let me get this
straight: she drugged you...

17:12.138 --> 17:14.354
and then you leeched her.

17:14.357 --> 17:15.757
Why is she still alive?

17:15.760 --> 17:17.309
- It's complicated.
- Oh.

17:17.310 --> 17:18.877
Let me un-complicate it for you.

17:18.878 --> 17:20.779
No, wait. From what I can gather,

17:20.781 --> 17:23.882
her life has been a series
of blows, one after another.

17:23.884 --> 17:26.318
She thought this was her way out.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.153
- That's no excuse.
- Her boyfriend's

17:28.155 --> 17:30.189
a 40-year-old DJ.

17:30.191 --> 17:32.124
Still no excuse.

17:32.126 --> 17:34.426
I learned to not kill.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.129
She can too.

17:37.131 --> 17:38.263
Fine.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.232
I won't kill her.

17:40.234 --> 17:42.768
But she is not sleeping on my couch.

17:50.144 --> 17:52.044
Good thing we have a psychic connection,

17:52.046 --> 17:54.580
'cause how else would
I know you're angry?

18:00.054 --> 18:02.421
- Fiji?
- Hi.

18:02.423 --> 18:04.756
This an okay time?

18:04.758 --> 18:06.452
Yeah, I could use a distraction.

18:06.455 --> 18:07.926
Well, uh...

18:07.928 --> 18:09.828
we need to banish two
ghosts from the hotel.

18:09.830 --> 18:13.198
Without making it
inhospitable to the dead.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.791
Um...

18:14.794 --> 18:16.056
yeah.

18:16.059 --> 18:17.625
Yeah, I-I know a spell.

18:21.442 --> 18:23.875
How you holding up?

18:23.877 --> 18:25.344
Oh, uh...

18:25.346 --> 18:26.645
fine.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.247
Why?

18:28.249 --> 18:29.671
You're a friend. I worry.

18:29.674 --> 18:32.017
Nothing to worry about.

18:32.019 --> 18:33.685
Breakups are hard.

18:33.687 --> 18:35.454
You haven't really
given yourself much time

18:35.456 --> 18:38.342
- to grieve.
- I don't know that "breakup"

18:38.345 --> 18:40.463
- is the right word.
- You almost buried her alive

18:40.466 --> 18:44.562
and she moved halfway across
the state to get away from you.

18:44.565 --> 18:47.266
Creek and I have been through worse.

18:47.268 --> 18:50.035
She asked you to let her go,

18:50.037 --> 18:52.404
and you have to respect that.

18:52.406 --> 18:53.905
Here it is.

18:53.907 --> 18:55.674
Oh.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.843
So, um, this spell

18:57.845 --> 19:00.085
should untether the
spirits from this world

19:00.088 --> 19:01.635
and force them into the next.

19:01.638 --> 19:03.881
We'll need a goat's heart, some sage,

19:03.884 --> 19:05.817
and the bones of the dead.

19:05.819 --> 19:07.786
- Where are they buried?
- There's no record

19:07.788 --> 19:10.055
of Carolyn's funeral,
and no one even knew

19:10.057 --> 19:13.458
that Bruce had killed himself
until his ghost showed up.

19:13.460 --> 19:16.328
So either the remains
are unidentified...

19:16.330 --> 19:17.681
Or never found.

19:17.684 --> 19:18.863
Hmm.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.800
- Where did he kill himself?
- I don't know.

19:21.802 --> 19:25.270
Bruce isn't much of a sharer.

19:25.272 --> 19:27.939
At least not willingly.

19:29.243 --> 19:31.143
Carolyn...

19:31.145 --> 19:32.511
I need your help.

19:32.513 --> 19:34.446
What are you doing?

19:34.448 --> 19:36.481
He'll kill anyone who comes near me.

19:36.483 --> 19:38.684
I know, but I need to
understand what happened

19:38.686 --> 19:39.851
when you died.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.331
Enter me.

19:43.334 --> 19:46.201
I'll see what you saw.

19:46.204 --> 19:47.592
Trust me.

20:00.874 --> 20:03.175
Bruce thought I was having an affair.

20:03.177 --> 20:05.510
He always thought I
was having an affair.

20:05.512 --> 20:07.145
That's why he moved us out here,

20:07.147 --> 20:09.481
- to keep me to himself.
- No!

20:09.483 --> 20:11.450
Don't listen to her.

20:11.452 --> 20:13.352
She's a liar.

20:17.057 --> 20:20.125
Then what's the truth?

20:27.201 --> 20:29.189
I was desperate to save our marriage.

20:29.192 --> 20:30.955
I thought we could
start over in Midnight,

20:30.958 --> 20:33.025
but she betrayed me...

20:33.028 --> 20:34.406
again.

20:34.408 --> 20:37.175
You want the truth?

20:37.177 --> 20:40.212
I was faithful... Until we moved here.

20:40.214 --> 20:42.581
I thought, "He'll never
believe I'm not cheating.

20:42.583 --> 20:46.118
Might as well have some fun
with men who don't terrify me."

20:46.120 --> 20:48.420
And for that, I was murdered.

20:50.391 --> 20:52.758
I didn't have a choice.
You were gonna leave me.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.227
You think I wanted to hurt you?

20:55.229 --> 20:58.263
You drowned me in our bathtub!

20:58.266 --> 20:59.999
Yeah, I think you wanted to hurt me!

21:00.002 --> 21:02.834
I don't have to listen to this.

21:04.705 --> 21:05.937
Enough!

21:05.939 --> 21:08.974
Okay, look, Bruce, I get it.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.327
She... she was your world,
and when everything else

21:11.330 --> 21:13.478
was going to literal hell, you could...

21:13.480 --> 21:15.380
You could still look at her and...

21:15.382 --> 21:17.516
And feel hope.

21:17.518 --> 21:19.117
You couldn't let her leave.

21:19.119 --> 21:21.586
There was no funeral.
I-I'm guessing the...

21:21.588 --> 21:23.555
The thought of putting her in the ground

21:23.557 --> 21:26.091
was... was unbearable.

21:28.629 --> 21:32.264
I was gonna send her body
back east to her family,

21:32.266 --> 21:35.333
but I loved her so much,
I couldn't let her go,

21:35.335 --> 21:39.171
so I made sure we'd be together forever.

21:42.409 --> 21:44.443
You think you're some romantic hero?

21:44.445 --> 21:46.511
You're a monster!

21:51.618 --> 21:52.884
We have to get her back.

21:52.886 --> 21:55.020
I have to explain.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.689
- You'll help me, right?
- No.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.533
I'm with her.

21:59.536 --> 22:02.326
You're real evil.

22:02.329 --> 22:04.996
You okay?

22:04.998 --> 22:06.631
He was obsessed.

22:06.633 --> 22:09.201
I saw it. I...

22:09.203 --> 22:10.936
I felt everything.

22:20.644 --> 22:23.514
He wanted the two of them
to be entombed in the hotel.

22:23.517 --> 22:26.151
- Together forever.
- Where?

22:26.153 --> 22:28.186
Looked like a...

22:28.188 --> 22:30.422
like a coal room.

22:30.424 --> 22:32.791
A coal room? We're a
certified eco-resort.

22:32.793 --> 22:34.693
- There's no coal room here.
- But the bones

22:34.695 --> 22:36.228
are in here somewhere.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.900
We have to find them.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.069
Picked up some cruelty-free blood.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.804
She better be grateful.

22:45.806 --> 22:47.105
Thanks.

22:47.107 --> 22:50.208
Oh, a stripper sleeping in.

22:50.210 --> 22:52.711
Who's shocked?

22:52.713 --> 22:54.813
Wake up.

22:56.633 --> 22:58.633
She's gone.

22:58.635 --> 23:01.336
What am I feeling now?

23:01.338 --> 23:03.238
Like killing something.

23:05.686 --> 23:09.104
The old blueprints should
be in here somewhere.

23:09.107 --> 23:11.457
If there was a coal
room back in the day,

23:11.460 --> 23:14.044
this will be the easiest way to find it.

23:14.046 --> 23:16.313
- Beautiful painting.
- Oh, well, that's been

23:16.315 --> 23:18.315
in my family forever.

23:18.317 --> 23:20.917
And the woman, who is she?

23:21.853 --> 23:24.554
I actually don't know.

23:24.556 --> 23:27.140
I kind of like not knowing.

23:27.142 --> 23:29.542
She can be whoever I want her to be.

23:33.048 --> 23:35.324
Okay...

23:35.327 --> 23:36.850
here they are.

23:43.976 --> 23:46.643
He took her body down the stairs...

23:46.645 --> 23:48.945
turned left...

23:48.947 --> 23:51.765
and then left again.

23:51.767 --> 23:53.965
Here. This was the coal room.

23:53.968 --> 23:56.319
That's where the bones are.

23:56.321 --> 23:58.905
You really think there's
been two dead bodies

23:58.907 --> 24:01.391
buried in this hotel the whole time?

24:01.393 --> 24:02.692
It's Midnight.

24:02.694 --> 24:04.894
There are skeletons in the closets.

24:04.896 --> 24:06.396
And the walls.

24:06.398 --> 24:08.431
And the floorboards.

24:22.113 --> 24:24.608
Avoiding someone?

24:24.611 --> 24:26.571
Spam.

24:26.574 --> 24:28.683
You know, it's really
impressive, what you've done,

24:28.686 --> 24:30.253
turning this place around.

24:30.255 --> 24:32.222
Thanks, man.

24:32.224 --> 24:33.523
Hey, you okay?

24:33.526 --> 24:36.326
You seem off lately.

24:36.328 --> 24:38.461
I don't know, I guess.

24:38.463 --> 24:41.097
You know, my life was
about hiding from Bowie

24:41.099 --> 24:43.472
for so long, and now, uh...

24:43.475 --> 24:45.969
You need a purpose.

24:47.739 --> 24:51.241
Well, I felt the same way
after I put my past behind me.

24:51.243 --> 24:53.042
Didn't know what to do with myself.

24:53.044 --> 24:54.877
So you opened the bar.

24:54.879 --> 24:57.313
You just need to find your bar.

24:59.584 --> 25:01.484
Thanks.

25:31.149 --> 25:32.815
Well...

25:32.817 --> 25:35.566
- trailer park was a bust.
- At least she hasn't killed.

25:35.569 --> 25:37.754
That we know of.

25:37.756 --> 25:40.156
Unless you two have
a psychic connection.

25:40.158 --> 25:42.066
Feeling your rage is
quite enough, thanks.

25:42.069 --> 25:44.594
Oh, well, if you don't like my feelings,

25:44.596 --> 25:47.263
- quit eavesdropping.
- Forgive me for the sin

25:47.265 --> 25:50.033
- of trying to help you.
- I am selfreliant,

25:50.035 --> 25:51.952
and you knew that when you married me.

25:51.955 --> 25:53.355
Oh, Olivia, why?

25:53.358 --> 25:56.235
Why this pathological
inability to accept help?

25:56.238 --> 25:58.004
It's who I am.

25:58.007 --> 26:00.043
No, I want to know.

26:00.045 --> 26:02.045
Why?

26:02.847 --> 26:05.081
Tell me. Because the last person

26:05.083 --> 26:08.318
I let myself rely on was my stepmother.

26:10.554 --> 26:12.905
- Olivia, I...
- It's...

26:12.908 --> 26:14.607
fine.

26:16.094 --> 26:17.560
Just think.

26:17.562 --> 26:20.430
What else do you know about Dawnette?

26:22.901 --> 26:26.069
She wants to go back
to school, quit her job.

26:26.071 --> 26:29.339
She hates the club, the
way men treat her there...

26:29.341 --> 26:31.174
That's where she is.

26:31.176 --> 26:33.209
The strip club.

26:33.211 --> 26:34.444
How do you know?

26:34.446 --> 26:37.380
Because it's what I would do.

26:37.382 --> 26:38.981
She's getting revenge.

26:51.996 --> 26:53.596
You're late again.

26:53.598 --> 26:56.282
I'm gonna have to put you on
day shift starting tomorrow.

27:12.584 --> 27:14.417
Hey, honey.

27:14.419 --> 27:15.936
Change your hair?

27:15.939 --> 27:17.687
Changed a lot more than that.

27:25.980 --> 27:27.647
Hello, boys.

27:33.254 --> 27:34.821
You know, I, um...

27:34.823 --> 27:37.402
I couldn't help overhearing
you and Fiji talking.

27:37.405 --> 27:39.625
I didn't know that
you just had a breakup.

27:39.627 --> 27:41.677
Oh, uh, it's more of a...

27:41.679 --> 27:43.362
- A break than a breakup.
- I just thought

27:43.364 --> 27:45.164
because she moved away that...

27:45.166 --> 27:47.733
No, I'm planning to
visit soon, actually.

27:47.735 --> 27:50.269
Be a... be a grown-up,
talk things through.

27:50.271 --> 27:53.806
Okay, well, that's good.

27:55.326 --> 27:58.461
Most people give up
when things get hard.

27:58.463 --> 28:01.998
You gotta take the
bitter with the sweet...

28:02.000 --> 28:05.134
even when there's a whole lot of bitter.

28:07.004 --> 28:09.371
Well, Creek and I aren't done.

28:09.374 --> 28:11.407
I can feel it.

28:16.798 --> 28:19.015
What the hell?

28:33.998 --> 28:35.765
It looks like we're in the right place.

28:42.140 --> 28:44.807
It's okay. It's okay.

28:44.809 --> 28:46.943
I need you to tell
me what happened here.

28:46.945 --> 28:48.858
I don't know.

28:48.861 --> 28:51.781
It was all so fast, and
nothing made any sense.

28:51.783 --> 28:54.817
Dawnette, she... she had fangs,

28:54.819 --> 28:57.277
and she bit Sweetness and Cashmere.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.289
They... they seemed
like they wanted her to.

29:00.291 --> 29:01.858
It was like they died, right?

29:01.860 --> 29:04.126
But then they got back up?

29:04.128 --> 29:06.746
Cashmere said she wanted
to go after her ex,

29:06.749 --> 29:09.511
but Dawnette said she
had one more stop first.

29:09.514 --> 29:10.900
She hated this place.

29:10.902 --> 29:13.302
Would do anything to get out of here.

29:15.573 --> 29:17.507
I think I know where she's headed.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.860
You should be safe on
this side of the line.

29:56.862 --> 29:59.363
Anything happens, get the hell out.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.540
- You, uh, cleared the hotel?
- Yeah.

30:01.543 --> 30:03.517
Well, some of the staff
stayed behind to lock up.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.197
But the rest of the guests, we sent them

30:05.200 --> 30:07.237
on a meditation retreat.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.039
Then let's get started.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.712
- Guys.
- Hmm.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.088
What are you doing?

30:24.090 --> 30:26.023
Serving your eviction notice.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.527
I nailed it shut. Don't
even think about it.

30:33.466 --> 30:35.165
How long's this gonna take?

30:35.167 --> 30:36.567
Longer if you keep pestering me.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.071
- Was... was that...
- Me?

30:41.073 --> 30:43.107
- No.
- Well, it must be

30:43.109 --> 30:44.508
a blown fuse. Why don't you check

30:44.510 --> 30:47.111
the breaker box downstairs?

30:47.113 --> 30:48.612
All right. Okay.

30:48.614 --> 30:51.048
Be careful. Watch her.

30:52.685 --> 30:55.676
Ignis spiritum liberat.

30:55.754 --> 30:58.639
Ignis spiritum liberat.

30:58.641 --> 31:01.725
- Is he still here?
- Ignis spiritum liberat.

31:01.727 --> 31:04.678
No, you can't separate us.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.463
Carolyn is mine!

31:08.234 --> 31:09.665
Yep, still here.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.337
Can't you just douse
it with lighter fluid

31:13.339 --> 31:16.563
- and call it a day?
- It is an ancient spell

31:16.566 --> 31:18.767
governing the barrier between
the living and the dead,

31:18.770 --> 31:20.878
- not a barbecue.
- Sure.

31:31.590 --> 31:35.192
- What's he doing now?
- I don't know.

31:37.963 --> 31:40.731
Patience, no!

31:40.733 --> 31:43.066
Manfred!

31:43.068 --> 31:45.669
Leave her alone!

31:45.671 --> 31:47.437
They're trying to separate us.

31:47.439 --> 31:48.739
Good.

31:52.878 --> 31:55.379
Fiji, we're... we're kind
of running out of time here.

32:13.566 --> 32:15.265
Thank you.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.970
There are secrets behind the woods.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.447
Nothing's working.

32:30.450 --> 32:33.650
Lyric, nothing's working.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.986
I found a flashlight.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.190
No, please!

33:01.366 --> 33:03.447
I don't want to kill a stripper.

33:05.455 --> 33:07.517
Isn't patriarchy the real enemy here?

33:07.520 --> 33:09.987
Guess not!

33:24.803 --> 33:26.637
What are you doing?

33:26.639 --> 33:28.372
I had it.

33:28.374 --> 33:29.815
That's not what it felt like.

33:32.845 --> 33:35.145
Where's the other one?

33:44.590 --> 33:46.790
I got this.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.541
Where's Dawnette?

34:09.581 --> 34:12.482
All I wanted was a chance.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.985
You couldn't even give me that.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.558
You came in for the front desk job.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.327
I know what you thought.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.228
I know what all of you think.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.791
"Not good enough," "bimbo," "slut."

34:27.793 --> 34:29.261
- I didn't think that.
- You're just like

34:29.263 --> 34:30.434
all the others.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.502
With them, I didn't have a choice.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.371
I just had to take it.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.139
But now...

34:36.141 --> 34:38.902
you're the one who's gonna beg.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.487
So you're headed to Austin now to, uh...

34:43.489 --> 34:45.842
To visit Creek?

34:45.844 --> 34:47.911
Um...

34:47.915 --> 34:50.281
no.

34:50.283 --> 34:52.717
No, she... she was right.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.587
If I really loved her, I'd let her go.

34:55.589 --> 34:58.056
- I don't want to...
- Be like Bruce?

34:58.058 --> 34:59.824
Yeah.

34:59.826 --> 35:01.793
Who knows? Maybe she'll
find her way back.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.528
And what if she doesn't?

35:03.530 --> 35:05.864
- Then that's her choice.
- Oh.

35:07.367 --> 35:09.050
Oh, God.

35:09.052 --> 35:10.919
Oh, I don't understand.

35:10.921 --> 35:13.472
- Bruce couldn't have...
- No.

35:13.475 --> 35:15.108
That was a vampire.

35:16.576 --> 35:18.565
Kai.

35:18.568 --> 35:20.011
I didn't see your pain before.

35:20.013 --> 35:21.296
I didn't, and I'm sorry.

35:21.298 --> 35:23.031
I-I shouldn't have sent you away.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.266
- But I can help you now.
- Shut up.

35:26.203 --> 35:28.803
- He doesn't deserve this.
- I don't care.

35:28.805 --> 35:31.390
Fine. You don't deserve this.

35:31.393 --> 35:33.508
You can't feel it now, but you will.

35:33.510 --> 35:35.810
Every death will weigh on you

35:35.812 --> 35:37.946
for the rest of your life.

35:37.948 --> 35:40.042
Like your friends who you turned.

35:42.065 --> 35:43.651
They're dead?

35:43.653 --> 35:44.853
They tried to kill others.

35:44.855 --> 35:46.321
We had to stop them.

35:48.742 --> 35:51.886
I was so tired of being insulted...

35:51.889 --> 35:53.360
used, groped.

35:53.363 --> 35:55.196
- I just wanted...
- To be powerful.

35:55.198 --> 35:56.331
I know.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.399
I wanted the same thing.

35:58.401 --> 36:00.768
And when every display of power you see

36:00.770 --> 36:02.170
comes with cruelty,

36:02.172 --> 36:04.823
you think the two are inseparable.

36:04.826 --> 36:05.940
They're not.

36:05.942 --> 36:08.076
You wanted to be a nurse.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.378
You can still help
people. I can teach you.

36:10.380 --> 36:11.625
Touching, but no.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.117
We already gave her a chance,
and look where that got us.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.700
No, no, no! No.

36:15.702 --> 36:17.385
No, I-I can cure her. I can cure her.

36:17.387 --> 36:19.154
Honey, maybe we should talk about this.

36:19.156 --> 36:21.806
- I can take the vampire out.
- That's not possible.

36:21.808 --> 36:23.424
No, energy is energy.

36:28.331 --> 36:29.531
Is that what you want?

36:29.533 --> 36:31.282
To be human again?

36:31.284 --> 36:34.102
I wish I'd never done any of it.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.703
I-I can't undo the past,

36:35.705 --> 36:38.473
but I can give you back your future.

37:09.489 --> 37:11.222
The hunger is gone.

37:23.570 --> 37:26.504
You can make supernaturals human again.

37:31.494 --> 37:33.562
He can turn a vampire
into a human again?

37:33.565 --> 37:35.597
Saw it with my own eyes.

37:35.599 --> 37:37.034
That changes everything.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.665
All of us are here
because some part of us

37:38.667 --> 37:40.501
doesn't fit in anywhere else.

37:40.503 --> 37:42.136
If he can take that part away...

37:42.138 --> 37:43.371
Aren't you tempted?

37:43.373 --> 37:46.107
Give up your powers, live a normal life?

37:46.109 --> 37:48.076
A year ago...

37:48.078 --> 37:50.862
I would have done it in a heartbeat.

37:50.865 --> 37:52.013
Not anymore.

37:52.015 --> 37:54.115
This is who I am.

37:54.117 --> 37:56.729
- What about you?
- I'm an angel.

37:56.732 --> 37:58.298
It's a whole different kind of energy.

37:58.301 --> 38:00.068
I'm stuck like this.

38:01.758 --> 38:03.791
Are you worried about Kai's intentions?

38:03.793 --> 38:05.460
Olivia still doesn't trust him.

38:05.462 --> 38:08.429
Olivia doesn't trust the sun to shine.

38:10.033 --> 38:12.300
But that doesn't mean she's wrong.

38:13.670 --> 38:15.870
A man died because of you.

38:15.872 --> 38:17.969
- I know.
- Because you ran to protect me

38:17.972 --> 38:19.607
instead of taking out the threat.

38:19.609 --> 38:21.776
- I know.
- That can't happen again.

38:21.778 --> 38:23.278
I can't promise that it won't.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.879
- Lem...
- Olivia.

38:24.881 --> 38:27.715
I feel your every emotion
as if it were my own.

38:27.717 --> 38:30.251
When you're in danger,
every cell in my body

38:30.253 --> 38:33.288
is on fire, screaming
for me to help you.

38:33.290 --> 38:36.124
I know what happened
in there was my fault...

38:36.126 --> 38:38.026
but I can't turn this off,

38:38.028 --> 38:40.561
and I can't ignore it.

38:40.563 --> 38:42.764
I wish I could.

38:49.005 --> 38:51.739
Then I don't know what to do.

39:01.348 --> 39:02.717
See?

39:02.719 --> 39:04.852
Safe as houses.

39:04.854 --> 39:07.055
Looks like the protection
potion's working.

39:07.057 --> 39:09.357
Or there never really was a threat

39:09.359 --> 39:11.826
and you overreact...

39:11.828 --> 39:14.195
No, I'm sure it was the potion.

39:14.197 --> 39:15.797
Yep.

39:15.799 --> 39:17.965
I don't know. Maybe I did overreact.

39:17.967 --> 39:19.600
I don't want to lose you right after

39:19.602 --> 39:21.402
we finally found each other.

39:21.404 --> 39:23.638
Aww, baby.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.274
Mm.

39:30.880 --> 39:34.248
Oh, oh.

39:34.250 --> 39:37.185
Oh!

39:45.395 --> 39:47.899
We had sex the night you moved in,

39:47.902 --> 39:49.130
and the plants died.

39:49.132 --> 39:51.165
We were making out at the pawnshop,

39:51.167 --> 39:52.806
and the chandelier fell. Now this?

39:52.809 --> 39:54.669
So you're saying that our sex life

39:54.671 --> 39:56.571
is causing me to have random accidents?

39:56.573 --> 39:57.939
Yes.

39:57.941 --> 39:59.907
- Feej, come on.
- No, no.

39:59.910 --> 40:01.709
No, we can't even touch.

40:01.711 --> 40:04.011
Not until I figure out how to stop this.

40:07.617 --> 40:09.235
Okay, Sequoia, what do we have next?

40:09.238 --> 40:11.285
Your next client has
been battling cancer

40:11.287 --> 40:13.821
for the past five years.

40:32.709 --> 40:35.777
There are secrets behind the woods.

41:06.209 --> 41:07.909
What the hell?
