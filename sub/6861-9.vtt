WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:05.773
You're the mayor?
Lavon Hayes, the linebacker?

00:05.773 --> 00:06.807
You share a generator

00:06.807 --> 00:07.975
with Wade Kinsella.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.943
I don't want you
getting any ideas.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.479
(screams)

00:11.479 --> 00:13.481
Notice how whenever I come
around, there's always sparks?

00:13.481 --> 00:15.049
How dare you see my patients?

00:15.049 --> 00:17.285
Well, technically, Harley left
his half of the practice to me.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.488
I'm not gonna share this office,
not for one minute.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.890
If one partner doesn't bring
in 30% of the revenue,

00:22.890 --> 00:25.759
every billing quarter, the other
partner can buy him or her out.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.761
I'm good at what I do,
and as soon as the town

00:27.761 --> 00:30.498
figures that out,
it'll be just fine.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.102
ZOE:
So Mom, you'll have
a car meeting me

00:34.102 --> 00:36.370
at the airport tonight?
Fantastic!

00:36.370 --> 00:38.572
Four whole days in New York!

00:39.540 --> 00:42.743
I am telling you,
I have earned it.

00:42.743 --> 00:47.115
Yeah. I finally got my 30%
of patients at the practice.

00:47.115 --> 00:50.084
Now I can relax,
and have Thanksgiving

00:50.084 --> 00:51.952
the way it was intended.

00:51.952 --> 00:55.123
Jean Georges is catering, right?

00:55.123 --> 00:56.390
Thank God.

00:56.390 --> 01:00.628
I am craving elegance
and refinement.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.331
The BlueBellians
are probably re-enacting

01:03.331 --> 01:05.132
the Pilgrims and Indian
corn trading, and...

01:05.132 --> 01:08.536
giving... thanks...

01:10.571 --> 01:11.972
Or not.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.841
Mom, see you tonight.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.209
Bye.

01:15.209 --> 01:18.612
I just saw the weirdest thing.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.281
Shiver me timbers.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.816
Oh, hi. Hardtack?

01:22.816 --> 01:24.352
I knew this day would come.

01:24.352 --> 01:28.222
You softened me up with
heat waves and blue people,

01:28.222 --> 01:29.490
but I'm not falling for this.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.958
WADE:
Oh, this is no joke.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.494
This is one of this town's

01:33.494 --> 01:36.130
most revered traditions.
The early settlers

01:36.130 --> 01:38.031
of BlueBell were doing
Thanksgiving things,

01:38.031 --> 01:39.367
shelling peas,
brining turkey...

01:39.367 --> 01:40.734
Watching football.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.304
Oh, no. Getting ready to
give thanks and chow down.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.038
When... whoosh!

01:45.038 --> 01:46.174
Big-ass hurricane...

01:46.174 --> 01:47.708
Washes everything away.
Gone.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.977
Crops, houses, stores,
all out to sea.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.779
But it washes some pirates in.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.148
Pirates?
Yes, pirates.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.549
But instead of pillaging,

01:55.549 --> 01:57.585
these pirates saw the
struggling people of BlueBell

01:57.585 --> 02:00.120
and gave them food and supplies
to get back on their feet.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.424
That's why, 200 years later,
instead of folks having

02:03.424 --> 02:07.027
turkeys at home, we honor
those pirates by dressing up

02:07.027 --> 02:08.795
and having a big fish fry

02:08.795 --> 02:09.997
in the town square.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.199
Which we call...

02:11.199 --> 02:13.201
Planksgiving.
Bam.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.569
This is the single stupidest

02:15.569 --> 02:18.071
thing I've heard
since I moved here.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.340
And I hear Wade
talking to his dates

02:19.340 --> 02:20.541
every night on his front porch.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.176
Hey!
Fine, I'm sure that your

02:22.176 --> 02:23.544
little fish fry is filled with

02:23.544 --> 02:26.347
as much adorableness
as it is cholesterol.

02:26.347 --> 02:30.384
But now I am doubly happy

02:30.384 --> 02:33.454
to be flying to New York
to eat turkey with my mom.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.423
Wade, enjoy your holiday.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.790
Lavon, see you later.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.892
Please change before you
take me to the airport.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.568
You didn't tell me Zoe was
going away for the holiday.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.537
I thought I did.
Yeah. Well, you didn't.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.607
Means I can try my new amp out.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.942
She's always complaining about

02:54.942 --> 02:57.077
how I'm blowing out
the power, and all that.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.546
Speaking of which,
I-I need a favor.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.984
Bought a new fuse box.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.954
Need you to help me to
install it while Zoe's away.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.489
I'm sick and tired

03:08.489 --> 03:11.359
of hearing y'all squabble
over electricity all the time.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.926
Hey. That' a great idea.
We need it!

03:12.926 --> 03:16.096
But, uh... you're gonna
have to find somebody else

03:16.096 --> 03:17.130
to install it.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.399
What are you talking about?

03:18.399 --> 03:20.401
Oh, I don't do electrical.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.803
Car engines, carpentry,
absolutely.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.205
But, uh, electrical
just ain't my thing.

03:25.205 --> 03:29.142
I'm sorry, but,
uh... another time.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.378
All right.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.280
All right, you take
it easy, Lavon.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.950
(gasps)
Oh, my God.
Avast, fair maiden!

03:36.950 --> 03:40.688
Come with me and we
will sail the seven seas!

03:40.688 --> 03:42.556
Honestly, George,
I don't have time

03:42.556 --> 03:46.260
to play pirate,
your parents are coming!

03:46.260 --> 03:48.429
Oh. But it's, uh,
it's Planksgiving.

03:48.429 --> 03:52.300
And I plan on plundering
me some pirate booty.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.767
Mm-hmm.
Okay, well...

03:53.767 --> 03:56.637
I would gladly let you pillage
me all day, Pirate Tucker.

03:56.637 --> 03:59.840
But I have to clean
and go to the store

03:59.840 --> 04:02.175
because for some reason,
your parents decided to

04:02.175 --> 04:03.911
crash our holiday.
Okay.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.246
Well... I mean...

04:06.246 --> 04:07.915
Y-you don't gotta
dust the outlets.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.918
Is that hat on too tight?

04:10.918 --> 04:12.320
Your mother hates me.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.456
And the last time I saw her,
I had a breakdown at Fancie's.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.291
Look...

04:18.291 --> 04:19.993
if it makes you feel any better,

04:19.993 --> 04:21.995
my mama also hates Oprah,

04:21.995 --> 04:24.064
and Reese Witherspoon,

04:24.064 --> 04:25.599
and springtime,

04:25.599 --> 04:27.335
and the U.S. Women's
Soccer Team.

04:27.335 --> 04:30.003
Hey, so, you admit it,
she hates me.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.706
Baby, all that matters

04:32.706 --> 04:34.475
is that I think you are perfect

04:34.475 --> 04:36.644
just the way you...

04:36.644 --> 04:38.912
arrgh!

04:42.282 --> 04:45.185
Yep. Eleven.
Well, now, count 'em again.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.620
Brick, I already
counted three times.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.458
Face it, Zoe got her 30% of
patients for this quarter.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.659
That is impossible,
'cause on Monday

04:51.659 --> 04:53.026
she was three patients shy.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.429
True, but then all four
MacKenzie brothers

04:55.429 --> 04:57.565
got into a bar fight,
and Zoe stitched 'em up.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.433
Then afterwards, they called

04:59.433 --> 05:01.234
and asked for Zoe to
do their follow-up.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.836
You know the rules:
they request Zoe,

05:02.836 --> 05:04.438
she's counted as their doctor.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.973
Now wait a minute,
you're telling me that

05:05.973 --> 05:08.509
the MacKenzie brothers--
my patients--

05:08.509 --> 05:11.244
specifically requested
Zoe Hart to treat them?

05:11.244 --> 05:14.448
Now why in the hell
would they do that?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.851
* *

05:22.956 --> 05:24.958
That explains it.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.762
I am getting
a cup of coffee.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.800
I take it he knows
about my 30%?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.668
Have to say, didn't
think you could do it.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.236
You've come a long way, missy.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.405
Well, the quarter's over,

05:37.405 --> 05:39.272
and my father's
legacy is intact.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.708
Now I'm going to New York City,

05:40.708 --> 05:43.210
where Zoe Hart can be a fish
in her own polluted water.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.312
Hey, Addy.
Is Brick in?

05:45.312 --> 05:48.749
Oh, he just stepped out, but
I have his partner, Dr. Hart.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.785
Guess you'll have to do.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.754
Well, isn't that sweet?
And what brings you in today?

05:53.754 --> 05:57.825
Caleb has been complaining of
itchiness for the last two days.

05:57.825 --> 06:02.029
Me name be
Small Cal No Beard!

06:02.029 --> 06:03.130
Of course it is.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.666
Right this way.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.636
Six more hours, six more hours,
six more hours...

06:09.703 --> 06:11.038
Hey, Lemon Meringue Pie!

06:11.038 --> 06:12.139
Oh, hi, Daddy.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.807
Hey. Can your old dad
buy you a cup of coffee?

06:13.807 --> 06:15.576
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.545
I'm running late. I gotta
buy those little onions

06:17.545 --> 06:19.279
the Tuckers like
in their martinis.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.549
'Cause Lord knows if they don't
have their teeny-tiny onions,

06:21.549 --> 06:24.952
then the whole earth is just
gonna spin off its axis.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.954
Ah, the Tuckers. Well, you know
your sister's so scared of them,

06:26.954 --> 06:28.689
she hightailed it to the
Richmans' for the weekend.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.791
Oh.
Yeah. Well, at least we only
have to put up with them

06:30.791 --> 06:32.826
a couple times a year.
Yeah.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.796
Unlike a certain New York City
doctor who is a thorn

06:35.796 --> 06:38.098
in my backside on a daily basis.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.833
I thought you two were
getting along better.

06:39.833 --> 06:43.103
That girl still does not
get what it is to be a GP.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.474
I mean, you know, what it's like
to spend 30 years with a family,

06:46.474 --> 06:47.975
watching them change and grow.

06:47.975 --> 06:51.979
No, she swishes her little hips,
and steals my patients.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.313
Oh, Daddy, I just...

06:53.313 --> 06:54.948
Oh. I wish
there was a spell

06:54.948 --> 06:57.718
that we could use
to just blow Zoe Hart

06:57.718 --> 06:59.920
right on out of this town.
Yeah.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.222
Maybe she'd take the
Tuckers along with her.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.557
Oh, Olive! A word, please.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.059
Uh, you know, sweetheart...

07:06.059 --> 07:09.797
sometimes I think we gotta
make our own spells.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.499
Um... I'll talk to you later.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.300
Uh, Olive? I just want to
tell you something...

07:13.300 --> 07:14.768
ZOE:
 Where is he itchy?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.970
Seems to be mostly
in his legs.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.371
Okay...

07:18.371 --> 07:20.541
Have you changed
laundry detergent?

07:20.541 --> 07:22.375
Bought new sheets?
No.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.444
What've you been
up to, lately?

07:24.444 --> 07:25.746
Pillaging.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.882
Sailing the seven seas,
looking for treasure.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.519
He really loves
Planksgiving.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.053
Well, he's a kid.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.523
He probably just rolled
around in some plant life.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.590
Hornswaggle!

07:36.590 --> 07:39.927
There be no plants
at sea, wench!

07:39.927 --> 07:43.697
Huh! That's Doctor
Wench to you, kid.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.033
He doesn't have a rash,
and his vitals are normal.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.502
I don't see any other symptoms.

07:48.502 --> 07:53.106
He's probably just having a mild
allergic reaction to something.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.842
Some antihistamines
should take care of it.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.644
Thanks so much.
We appreciate it.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.579
(phone ringing)

08:00.814 --> 08:03.016
One more patient
to add to my pile.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.753
Addy, can you, uh, see if I
can get on an earlier flight?

08:05.753 --> 08:07.487
I don't see any reason
why I couldn't make it.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.557
Okay, Tommy,
all medical records

08:09.557 --> 08:11.491
transferred back
to Dr. Breeland.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.061
Yes, your brothers
already called.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.930
All MacKenzies back
to Dr. Breeland.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.232
Bye now.
MacKenzies?
My MacKenzies?

08:19.232 --> 08:20.934
Oh, no, they're
 my MacKenzies.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.502
See, I just happened
to bump into

08:22.502 --> 08:25.305
Tommy MacKenzie's wife, Olive.
Now the funny thing is,

08:25.305 --> 08:27.841
Olive had never heard that
her husband switched over

08:27.841 --> 08:31.044
to the pretty lady doctor
in the short shorts.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.982
Brick, you've got
to be kidding me.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.250
I knew you wouldn't
be happy that I got my 30%,

08:37.250 --> 08:39.653
but I didn't think
you'd poach my patients.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.690
You did it first.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.692
Oh, I most certainly did not.
Oh, yes, you did.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.026
Oh, no, I did not.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.329
I treated them because
they asked to see me.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.731
I'll tell you what.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.934
You can have them if you can
name all four brothers.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.468
Fine.

08:55.468 --> 08:59.673
MacKenzie comma Tommy.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.877
Mackenzie comma...

09:03.877 --> 09:05.478
Logan.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.681
MacKenzie...

09:08.949 --> 09:10.183
MacKenzie...

09:10.183 --> 09:11.752
The other two didn't
speak that much.

09:11.752 --> 09:16.056
Well, you go on up to
New York, have a good time,

09:16.056 --> 09:19.059
and I'll just stay here
and buy you out.

09:20.493 --> 09:24.865
Oh. Enjoy your... Thanksgiving.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.316
Well, you got Cap'n No Beard
this morning,

09:43.316 --> 09:44.718
so that puts you three shy.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.453
Well, I still have a couple
hours before my flight.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.521
You really think you can get
three patients by midnight?

09:48.521 --> 09:50.724
Not playing by the book, no.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.064
GEORGE: I was awfully surprised
to see y'all

09:57.064 --> 09:59.166
come down here
for Planksgiving.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.134
MR. TUCKER:
Well, thought we'd
mix things up.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.370
In fact, we've learned to
embrace a new tradition

10:03.370 --> 10:06.206
in Montgomery.
It's called Thanksgiving.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.777
We brought a turkey
with all the trimmings.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.012
Lemon, you and I can wake up
early and get started.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.081
I can see how your
cooking's coming along!

10:14.081 --> 10:15.215
(laughs)

10:15.215 --> 10:16.249
Yay!

10:16.249 --> 10:18.418
I've always wanted to

10:18.418 --> 10:21.221
make a real Thanksgiving dinner.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.422
From scratch.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.924
For hours and hours...

10:23.924 --> 10:26.626
Look, Mom, thank you so much,
it's very nice of you,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.896
but our tradition
is Planksgiving.

10:28.896 --> 10:32.032
George, you can have your
little fish fry next year.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.702
But this dinner is
our chance to celebrate.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.303
Celebrate what?

10:36.303 --> 10:37.370
Your brother, Harry...

10:37.370 --> 10:39.339
...is going to run for
the state legislature!

10:39.339 --> 10:41.641
Well, that's, I mean
that's, that's great!
How exciting!

10:41.641 --> 10:43.977
That's...
A politician in the family.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.512
Yeah, that's great.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.614
Of course, that means that
Harry's gonna have to

10:47.614 --> 10:48.949
resign from the law firm.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.920
Leaving his position open.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.925
GEORGE: Look, Dad, we've
talked about this. Okay?

10:57.925 --> 11:00.193
I already left once
to do corporate law.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.696
It wasn't my thing
for many, many reasons.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.733
I'm not leaving BlueBell again,
period.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.234
But that's the best part.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.102
Your father convinced
his partners

11:09.102 --> 11:10.904
to let you work
 from BlueBell!

11:10.904 --> 11:12.840
You'd only be in Montgomery
three days a week.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.842
The firm has housing
you can use.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.143
And, well, Lemon, that means

11:16.143 --> 11:18.846
that you'll have to join him

11:18.846 --> 11:20.881
on those days.

11:20.881 --> 11:25.786
Oh. Three days a week?
With you?

11:25.786 --> 11:27.454
That's just swell!

11:37.998 --> 11:43.270
Okay, $100 for the first person

11:43.270 --> 11:47.574
to make a doctor's
appointment with me right now!

11:47.574 --> 11:50.543
Come on!

11:50.543 --> 11:53.613
Zoe, I'm sorry,
but um... Brick is our doctor.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.083
And we are a loyal bunch.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.853
Shelley!

11:59.853 --> 12:01.789
Shell! Shellster,

12:01.789 --> 12:04.124
Shellerino?

12:04.825 --> 12:06.059
I'm sorry, Zoe.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.195
I really am.
I think you're great.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.263
I really do.
It's just that I saw

12:10.263 --> 12:12.732
Brick for a checkup right
before you got here,

12:12.732 --> 12:13.867
and I feel great.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.135
But you had a headache
the other day.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.703
It went away with two aspirin.

12:16.703 --> 12:17.871
You know, there was

12:17.871 --> 12:20.808
this case
of this guy with a headache.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.910
Turns out he had a whole set
of teeth

12:22.910 --> 12:24.878
growing behind his eyeballs.

12:30.317 --> 12:33.887
All right, meet you at your
office in a couple minutes.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.994
Hey, Tom...
Tommy!

12:40.994 --> 12:42.395
Oh, no, no, no.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.231
My mom will kill me

12:44.231 --> 12:46.399
if I see a doctor
other than Dr. Breeland.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.801
He delivered me!

12:47.801 --> 12:49.769
Come on, Tom.
I need new patients today.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.841
If you be my girlfriend
for a month.

12:53.841 --> 12:54.842
Okay.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.076
Yeah?
No.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.311
Oh...
An ounce of realism,
please, Tom?

12:58.311 --> 12:59.813
Show me your boobs.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.849
One boob?

13:01.849 --> 13:03.516
How about you come
with me right now,

13:03.516 --> 13:06.954
and I won't tell your mother
what you just asked me to do?

13:07.787 --> 13:08.856
Deal.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.357
Okay.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.524
I cannot believe

13:11.524 --> 13:15.195
that we agreed to do
Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.

13:15.195 --> 13:18.999
I mean, shoot, even if
it does get done by 7:00,

13:18.999 --> 13:20.600
we're gonna miss the
plank-walking contest!

13:20.600 --> 13:23.003
Plank-walking?
Really, George?

13:23.003 --> 13:25.372
That was your big takeaway
from lunch?

13:25.372 --> 13:29.142
Why, Lemon Breeland,
don't you know me at all?

13:29.142 --> 13:31.144
I'm not taking that job.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.080
My dad doesn't even
respect me as a lawyer.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.148
The only reason
he wants me is
'cause Harry left

13:35.148 --> 13:38.051
and he wants to retain voting
majority with his partners.

13:38.051 --> 13:41.121
(scoffs) No, I have absolutely
no intention whatsoever

13:41.121 --> 13:43.756
of giving up my practice.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.893
Oh! Oh, my God, George,

13:45.893 --> 13:47.827
I love you so much
right now!

13:47.827 --> 13:49.229
I was freaking out!

13:49.229 --> 13:50.563
I know.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.865
Oh! Okay,
so you know what?

13:51.865 --> 13:54.767
We will just pretend
like we thought about it,

13:54.767 --> 13:56.970
and after
their Thanksgiving,

13:56.970 --> 13:58.805
we will just
tell them no.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.774
Exactly. And then we can
celebrate this day

14:01.774 --> 14:03.210
like it's meant to be.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.678
With a fish fry,
ruffled shirts

14:05.678 --> 14:06.513
and eye patches!

14:06.513 --> 14:08.381
BOTH:
Arrgh!

14:08.381 --> 14:10.517
There you two are!

14:10.517 --> 14:14.721
Oh, I was just on my way to buy
a few things for tomorrow.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.523
Lemon, would
you like to come?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.725
Of course!

14:18.725 --> 14:22.862
Shopping with you, Clora?
Is there anything better?

14:25.665 --> 14:27.667
(Wade whistles)

14:27.667 --> 14:29.102
Hey-o!

14:29.102 --> 14:30.470
Whatcha working on, hoss?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.205
This was my grandmama's.
Just trying to fix it

14:32.205 --> 14:34.407
so I can give it back to her
for her birthday.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.475
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.677
Look, you got your
capacitors all wrong here.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.512
Check me out.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.414
Okay, no polarity.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.015
Mm-hmm.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.017
Yes polarity.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.318
So you put
that in wrong,

14:45.318 --> 14:47.487
when you plug it in,
it will explode.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.591
No more grandmama's radio,
no more fingers.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.292
Gotcha!

14:52.292 --> 14:53.760
What?

14:53.760 --> 14:54.861
This radio was a Wade trap.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.130
And you stuck
your big paw in it.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.565
Now you're mine.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.000
I don't know what you're
talking about.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.234
You lied to me

15:01.234 --> 15:03.236
this morning.
You can do electrical work.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.773
So? Maybe I didn't feel like
installing

15:06.773 --> 15:09.876
your new fuse box. So what?

15:09.876 --> 15:11.411
Exactly.
The question is why?

15:11.411 --> 15:15.148
After all, every time it blows,
Zoe comes stomping over

15:15.148 --> 15:16.916
and yells at you.
(snaps fingers)

15:16.916 --> 15:19.452
But you know what Lavon Hayes
figured out?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.555
That only crackpots talk in
the third person?

15:22.555 --> 15:26.926
Ah, Lavon Hayes figured out that
you like Zoe coming over,

15:26.926 --> 15:29.596
which means you like Zoe.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.398
Look, if by "like" you mean
I'd do her?

15:31.398 --> 15:34.101
Sure, you got me.
I'd do her.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.969
But I'm not that picky.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.604
Mmm-mm, mmm-mm.
By "like," I mean

15:37.604 --> 15:42.475
you love... her.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.143
Hey.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.145
You are in big trouble.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.547
What?
You know what
I just realized?
A month ago

15:47.547 --> 15:49.849
you made a doctor's appointment
and then you canceled it.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.385
At least this guy had the good
sense to need stitches.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.087
I had a sore throat,
and it went away.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.155
What's the big deal?

15:55.155 --> 15:56.723
Canceled patients don't count!

15:56.723 --> 15:59.526
Brick is about to take over the
practice, and I need patients.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.861
Zoe, I'd like to help you
out, but the thing is

16:01.861 --> 16:03.496
there nothing's bothering me.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.833
I-I don't want to be unethical
I'm the mayor of this town.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.936
Ow! Oh, ow! Ow!
(Wade chuckles)

16:09.936 --> 16:11.471
Now something's bothering you.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.107
Come on. Just stop in, and
then we'll go to the airport.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.209
(door shuts)

16:16.209 --> 16:17.610
Oh, yeah, Lavon.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.313
Mmm! She is a real catch.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.919
That's three patients,
which brings me to 30%,

16:26.919 --> 16:28.655
which also means

16:28.655 --> 16:29.789
"Ha-ha-ha, Brick Breeland."

16:29.789 --> 16:32.059
If anyone needs me,
I'll be at Barney's.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.993
Lavon, let's go.
Not so fast.

16:35.095 --> 16:38.331
They just came in,
and they specifically asked

16:38.331 --> 16:40.533
for someone who
was not you.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.870
So I wouldn't head
to that airport quite yet.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.138
You're still one shy.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.008
(sighs)

16:52.679 --> 16:54.081
Caleb, are you okay?

16:54.081 --> 16:56.649
Me pirate fingers
be aching.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.286
Dr. Hart, your services are
not needed here.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.121
Let me help.
Caleb is my patient.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.256
Yeah, he was your patient.
Exactly.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.525
Allergic reaction, my foot.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.261
He wasn't in pain this morning.
That's new.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.362
Let me examine him.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.797
Look, Dr. Hart,
maybe you should

17:10.797 --> 17:13.665
see me about having that wax
cleaned out of your ears.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.736
He is not your patient anymore.
Now go.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.339
Please go!

17:21.340 --> 17:22.541
ZOE
 What are his other symptoms?

17:22.541 --> 17:24.243
Joint pain and itchiness
are all we got.

17:24.243 --> 17:27.380
Blood panel including CBC,

17:27.380 --> 17:29.782
chem 7 and tox screen?

17:29.782 --> 17:32.085
Brick has no idea
what Caleb has.
Nope.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.687
So if I diagnose him first,

17:34.687 --> 17:37.557
then maybe his mother
will rename me as his doctor.

17:37.557 --> 17:42.729
You'd also have the satisfaction
of treating a sick kid.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.097
That, too.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.565
Shady, I gotta
tell ya

17:45.565 --> 17:48.168
I am a little surprised that
you want to sell the store.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.837
I mean, Nate's Hardware has

17:50.837 --> 17:53.906
been in your family for,
forever. And this price?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.642
I mean, I gotta say, no offense,

17:55.642 --> 17:58.778
but it's a little low,
don't you think?

17:58.778 --> 18:01.914
Yeah, but, uh, you know,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.783
it's, it's about
a life change, George.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.819
I mean, I've been tied to my
great-grandpa's store

18:06.819 --> 18:08.255
for way too long now.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.457
And my family and I, we're just
ready to move on.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.893
Wait. Are you leaving BlueBell?

18:13.893 --> 18:15.328
Let's face it, George.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.230
There's bigger and better out
there in the world.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.065
And I intend to find it.

18:19.065 --> 18:22.302
Wow.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.205
Well, okay. I will draw up
the paperwork for you.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.341
And I'll see you, say,
this afternoon?

18:28.341 --> 18:30.743
All right.
Thank you much, George.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.379
You're welcome.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.847
SHADY:
How ya doing?
Afternoon.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.352
Real estate deals?

18:39.352 --> 18:41.454
A paralegal could
handle that.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.156
Hell, a secretary could.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.391
Yeah. I don't mind it.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.692
Well, it's
a waste of time

18:45.692 --> 18:47.694
that could be used doing things
of value.

18:47.694 --> 18:52.199
That's the beauty of working
with a large firm-- resources.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.467
(phone rings)

18:56.436 --> 18:58.505
My secretary's at
the beauty salon.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.173
Uh-huh.
It's a standing
appointment.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.175
George Tucker.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.178
Okay, itching and joint pain
could indicate

19:05.178 --> 19:06.213
a hundred different things.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.580
Did Caleb give
any other clues?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.716
Only about marauding
and swashbuckling.

19:09.716 --> 19:13.786
Well, the kid's clearly weird.
Maybe there's a clue in that.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.088
He's not weird. He's ten, Zoe.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.123
And this is how

19:17.123 --> 19:18.325
ten-year-old boys behave.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.260
Yeah, and ten-year-olds
are weird.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.394
This how I nearly failed
my peds rotation.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.530
I need more information.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.398
I need eyes and ears
in that room.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.500
LAVON:
Hey, this is a
great magazine.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.369
Who knew electrophysiologists
shop

19:29.369 --> 19:31.671
for bulk toilet paper
just like us?

19:31.671 --> 19:34.407
Oh, we need to get
to the airport.
Lavon...

19:35.107 --> 19:37.076
How much do you love me?

19:37.076 --> 19:39.212
Why?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.619
Oh, hey, this isn't
the bathroom.

19:46.619 --> 19:47.620
(chuckles)

19:47.620 --> 19:49.556
What's up,
Captain No Beard?

19:49.556 --> 19:51.123
(chuckles)

19:51.123 --> 19:53.793
CLORA:
 There's something

19:53.793 --> 19:56.963
very soothing about
shelling peas, isn't there?

19:56.963 --> 19:59.632
Reminds me
of a simpler time,

19:59.632 --> 20:02.602
a time when family
meant everything.

20:03.836 --> 20:07.440
You know, you and I are going
to be family very soon,

20:07.440 --> 20:10.610
so I think it's time
we had a frank conversation.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.444
(chuckles)

20:11.444 --> 20:12.845
Whatever about, Clora?

20:12.845 --> 20:15.915
Lemon, you don't have
to pretend.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.386
We both know that things
aren't right between us.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.721
We've gotten off
on the wrong foot,

20:21.721 --> 20:24.957
and I'm big enough to admit
that's all my fault.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.462
I had a practice
in BlueBell, too, son.

20:29.462 --> 20:33.232
I, I know that small town law
can get a little, uh, small.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.667
Yeah, I mean,

20:34.667 --> 20:36.936
Lovey Swann over at the
library is actually having me

20:36.936 --> 20:40.206
sue Parker Mason over
an overdue library book.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.441
(both laughing)

20:41.441 --> 20:44.477
But, Dad, come
on, you, you know

20:44.477 --> 20:46.078
I love helping
out my community.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.247
You could still
help them.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.516
With a big firm
behind you,

20:49.516 --> 20:51.217
you could make
some real changes around here.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.786
Class actions,
defense teams.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.987
Lemon, I get it.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.490
Why in the world would you
let George take this job?

20:57.490 --> 20:58.991
You don't want him
around us

20:58.991 --> 21:01.728
because you don't want
to be around us.

21:01.728 --> 21:05.632
I mean, you have been a,
a tad bit critical of me.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.567
I've been
a judgmental hag.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.702
I know what kind
of lawyer you are.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.739
More importantly, I know
what kind of man you are.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.108
CLORA:
 The crazy part is,

21:16.108 --> 21:18.177
I always wanted a girl,

21:18.177 --> 21:20.547
but instead,
just boys.

21:22.382 --> 21:26.052
And here you are,
the daughter I always wanted,

21:26.052 --> 21:30.323
and instead of embracing you,
I turn my back.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.691
HAROLD:
 Truth is...

21:32.925 --> 21:36.062
...your brother doesn't have
half your smarts

21:36.062 --> 21:37.397
or half your heart.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.066
I need you
at my firm, son.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.071
George, I need you.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.677
(chuckles)

21:50.677 --> 21:52.512
Lemon,

21:52.512 --> 21:56.182
I know you've missed having
a mother in your life.

21:56.182 --> 21:59.486
And I want to be
that for you.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.460
Well?

22:07.460 --> 22:09.796
I heard coughing and
Caleb said he was dizzy.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.097
Anything else?
Anything at all?

22:11.097 --> 22:15.435
Uh... He was scratching
behind his ear a lot.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.438
Huh.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.106
Maybe he finally does
have a rash.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.774
Could you go look at it?

22:21.774 --> 22:23.209
Are you crazy?

22:23.209 --> 22:26.579
The mayor of BlueBell
can't be creeping
around exam rooms.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.782
And how many times can I lose
my way to the bathroom?

22:41.327 --> 22:43.930
Oh, for Pete's sake!

22:46.599 --> 22:49.802
(phone ringing)

22:51.871 --> 22:53.473
Hey, babe.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.642
Hi.
I was just
going to call you.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.343
Listen, I've been thinking--

22:57.343 --> 22:59.045
I know it isn't
what we discussed,

22:59.045 --> 23:01.714
but maybe we should consider
your father's offer.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.684
(chuckles)
That's funny, 'cause Lemon,

23:04.684 --> 23:07.053
I was thinking
the exact same thing, I mean...

23:07.053 --> 23:09.856
it turns out my dad really does
want me there, and...

23:09.856 --> 23:11.924
And it's a great
career opportunity.

23:11.924 --> 23:15.462
Plus, your mother and I
have had a breakthrough.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.865
Really? Wow.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.867
So we're really doing this?

23:20.867 --> 23:25.171
I think we are--
Senior Associate Tucker.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.278
So, did you see the rash?

23:32.278 --> 23:34.814
No rash. It was
just salt residue.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.583
We're back
to square one.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.685
Why would Caleb have
salt behind his ear?

23:38.685 --> 23:42.021
Like salt water? Residue you get
from swimming in the ocean.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.390
Okay, so Caleb has been
swimming in the bay.

23:44.390 --> 23:45.525
Maybe there's something
in that.

23:45.525 --> 23:48.260
Itching, joint pain,

23:48.260 --> 23:50.129
ocean...

23:52.565 --> 23:55.768
Zoe, you okay?
Addie, I know what's wrong
with Caleb. Call an ambulance.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.783
Caleb is only
ten years old.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.719
He doesn't even know
how to scuba dive.

24:12.719 --> 24:15.955
This morning he said he was
sailing the seven seas
looking for treasure.

24:15.955 --> 24:19.258
He also told me he made his
principal walk the plank.

24:19.258 --> 24:22.061
Maybe we should dredge
the bay for Mr. Babcock.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.897
Caleb...
Me name be
Captain Cal No Beard.

24:24.897 --> 24:27.734
Fine. Captain No Beard, you have
to tell the truth right now.

24:27.734 --> 24:30.803
If you've been diving,
you're only going to
get sicker and sicker.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.339
How dare you scare him.
He's just a boy.

24:33.339 --> 24:36.142
Look, you are out of this room,
you are out of this practice.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.744
Me hast been diving.

24:37.744 --> 24:38.878
What do you mean?

24:38.878 --> 24:40.613
You don't know how
to scuba dive.

24:40.613 --> 24:43.449
Me brother Nate taught me.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.585
Me robbed him of his suit.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.121
And took to the bay.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.489
Nate has
scuba gear

24:50.489 --> 24:51.958
because he's 17
and taken lessons.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.993
Caleb, what
were you thinking?

24:53.993 --> 24:56.729
Becky, Caleb has
decompression sickness.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.731
It's what divers
call the bends.

24:58.731 --> 25:02.234
We have an ambulance coming,
and he needs to get into a
hyperbaric chamber right away.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.704
I know it sounds scary,
but as long as we

25:04.704 --> 25:07.574
take care of it quickly
he'll be fine. And when
he comes back,

25:07.574 --> 25:09.909
he'll come in for
a follow-up with me.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.516
See, Crickett, it was all
just a big misunderstanding

25:17.516 --> 25:20.920
like she was a mama lion
protecting her cub.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.354
Montgomery?

25:22.354 --> 25:24.824
I still can't believe
you're going to be bi-citial.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.626
Crickett, that's
not even a word, sweetie.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.761
But BlueBell

25:28.761 --> 25:30.329
will always be my home.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.164
But what about
your civic duties?

25:32.164 --> 25:34.100
How are we gonna
get on without you?

25:34.100 --> 25:37.970
Oh, well, you'll
just have to forge on.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.372
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

25:40.372 --> 25:43.175
I have to go help my future
in-laws shop for Thanksgiving.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.612
I can't believe George
caved so quickly.

25:45.612 --> 25:48.815
Nice work today.
Well, I knew Lemon was key

25:48.815 --> 25:50.282
to getting
him onboard.
Mm-hmm.

25:50.282 --> 25:54.053
Of course, I practically
had to promise to breastfeed her

25:54.053 --> 25:56.222
to get her over
on our side.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.224
(laughing)

26:04.196 --> 26:06.265
You know, Shady,
you coming in earlier,

26:06.265 --> 26:09.669
you, uh, you sort of inspired
me to make a change, too.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.137
Oh, yeah? How's that?

26:11.137 --> 26:15.842
Well, I... I'm going
to close up shop here,

26:15.842 --> 26:18.177
and I'm going to go
join a larger firm.

26:18.177 --> 26:22.281
Congratulations, George.
That's-- that's great.

26:22.281 --> 26:26.152
Is everything okay, Shady?
(phone ringing)

26:26.152 --> 26:27.253
Hold on a sec.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.521
Of course.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.824
Hello?

26:31.824 --> 26:34.260
I'll be right there.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.195
Wait, Shady, what...? Shady?

26:36.195 --> 26:38.130
WADE:
Come... oh!

26:38.130 --> 26:39.632
Turn around.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.634
Come on.
(door opening)

26:41.634 --> 26:44.336
Thought you were taking
Zoe to the airport.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.239
(engines revving on TV)

26:47.239 --> 26:49.075
She had a last-minute
medical emergency,

26:49.075 --> 26:51.143
so, she got
a later flight.
Oh.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.812
Said she'll call
when she's ready.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.481
You know, I've been thinking,
if you did like Zoe...

26:55.481 --> 26:57.684
I don't, all right?

26:57.684 --> 26:59.385
Uh-huh. So, my idea--

26:59.385 --> 27:01.153
you take her to the airport.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.824
Tell her how you feel right
before she gets on the plane.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.860
Now, if she feels the same,
you have yourself a nice,

27:07.860 --> 27:10.162
romantic, airport good-bye kiss.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.798
If she doesn't,

27:11.798 --> 27:15.702
she gets on the plane,
and no one has to talk about it.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.239
I don't like her, okay?

27:21.273 --> 27:23.342
(chuckling)

27:23.342 --> 27:24.576
Mm-hmm.

27:24.576 --> 27:27.579
Now, if you please.

27:27.579 --> 27:29.215
Flight leaves at 8:00.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.183
(tires screech, crashing
on video game)

27:31.183 --> 27:32.184
Hmm.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.690
(door closes)

27:37.690 --> 27:39.692
(gasps)
There you two are!

27:39.692 --> 27:42.294
I made a reservation
for us at Fancie's

27:42.294 --> 27:43.495
in a half an hour.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.563
Harold, a martini?

27:44.563 --> 27:45.898
Sounds good to me.

27:45.898 --> 27:49.836
Great. Oh, and I got that gouda
you like, Mama.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.404
It is okay
if I call you Mama, right?

27:54.206 --> 27:56.208
(laughs quietly)

27:59.445 --> 28:01.580
Shady!
Caleb, are you okay?

28:01.580 --> 28:02.715
I'm sorry.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.683
SHADY:
Why were you
scuba diving?

28:04.683 --> 28:05.885
I wanted
to find the pirate treasure.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.120
What-What pirate treasure?

28:08.120 --> 28:09.956
From the ship
in the Planksgiving story.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.758
I thought if I could find it,

28:11.758 --> 28:13.392
you wouldn't have
to sell the store,

28:13.392 --> 28:16.195
and we wouldn't have to
move in with Aunt Glenese,

28:16.195 --> 28:19.031
and you wouldn't have to go away
to look for work.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.399
We could stay a family.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.406
Look, I... I didn't want anyone
to know.

28:27.406 --> 28:30.342
All right? Everyone's
been buying their supplies

28:30.342 --> 28:32.111
off the Internet lately.

28:35.982 --> 28:39.151
Son, I appreciate
what you tried to do, but...

28:39.151 --> 28:41.220
there isn't any pirate treasure.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.689
It's just some story
somebody made up

28:43.689 --> 28:45.825
a long time ago.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.862
We should go.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.870
Wait!

28:58.871 --> 29:01.673
I don't want it anymore.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.976
If there's
no treasure,

29:03.976 --> 29:06.445
I can't help them.

29:08.247 --> 29:12.018
I just wanted my family
to stay together.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.828
Hey.

29:23.229 --> 29:26.032
So, we going to the
airport or what?

29:33.439 --> 29:35.007
BRICK:
 A ten-year-old

29:35.007 --> 29:36.142
with the bends.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.476
I mean, I can't
believe it.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.078
No, you can't blame
yourself about that.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.113
Me, on the other hand--
I mean, Shady Hilson wanting

29:41.113 --> 29:43.182
to sell his hardware store--
I should have known better.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.117
George, you never
could have known.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.053
Neither of us could have, but...

29:47.053 --> 29:50.289
We're gonna have to figure out
a way to help them.
I completely agree.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.824
(sighs)

29:51.824 --> 29:54.760
(sighs)
What happened to Lavon?

29:54.760 --> 29:57.964
Uh, yeah, well, I, uh...

29:57.964 --> 30:00.266
I happened to be going
to the airport anyway,

30:00.266 --> 30:01.767
so...

30:01.767 --> 30:04.736
I do that sometimes
to visit my buddy

30:04.736 --> 30:08.174
the, uh... bag guy.

30:09.275 --> 30:12.344
So, it's not a special
trip or anything.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.512
You know, kids--

30:13.512 --> 30:16.815
they get so caught up
in stories and fantasies.

30:16.815 --> 30:21.053
You feel like a jerk when
their little hearts get broken.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.455
Really don't know what
you're talking about.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.925
So, the airport?

30:25.925 --> 30:29.595
Hey, y'all, can you give us a
ride back to the Breeland house?

30:29.595 --> 30:32.231
We got a lot of work to do, and
every minute's gonna count.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.400
Uh, actually....
Yeah, sure, hop in.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.501
Thanks.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.703
Is it this?

30:37.703 --> 30:40.072
But...
No...

30:40.072 --> 30:41.207
Ow. Ow.
BRICK:
Wade...

30:41.207 --> 30:42.574
Watch the...
BRICK:
Ooh, sorry.

30:42.574 --> 30:43.709
GEORGE:
All right.

30:43.709 --> 30:44.877
BRICK:
Thank you.

30:44.877 --> 30:45.978
Ah.
(door closes)

30:45.978 --> 30:47.413
Welcome aboard.

30:47.413 --> 30:50.316
LEMON:
You know, Mama, Dad,
I've been thinking.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.251
You know, George and I don't
need our own place

30:52.251 --> 30:53.886
in Montgomery
for only three days a week.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.021
We can just stay with you.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.622
Won't that be

30:56.622 --> 30:58.857
so cozy?
Of course,
dear.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.492
Oh, we can play charades
every night.

31:00.492 --> 31:01.360
I just love charades.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.094
Don't you?

31:02.094 --> 31:04.030
Wait. Guess this one.

31:04.030 --> 31:06.332
(singing note)

31:06.332 --> 31:08.167
(laughs)

31:09.235 --> 31:13.305
Sure hope we're not
late to the airport.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.840
Somebody's got a
plane to catch.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.342
GEORGE:
You know what
we should do?

31:16.342 --> 31:18.144
We should call
the town council.
Yeah.

31:18.144 --> 31:19.645
They got to have some jobs
for, uh... for Nate's.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.914
You guys are gonna help Caleb
and his family?

31:21.914 --> 31:23.182
You're more
than welcome to join us

31:23.182 --> 31:24.750
if you want to change
your travel plans.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.285
No, my mom's expecting me.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.220
I already saved the kid's life,
got him to the hospital.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.488
What more could I do?

31:29.488 --> 31:31.190
Well, you know, my
business card says doctor,

31:31.190 --> 31:32.424
and George's
says lawyer,

31:32.424 --> 31:34.193
but those titles
don't begin to explain

31:34.193 --> 31:36.095
what people like us mean
to the community.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.263
I mean, BlueBell counts on us.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.664
What are you
gonna do?

31:38.664 --> 31:41.067
Find the Hilsons some
Planksgiving buried treasure?

31:41.067 --> 31:43.069
(laughs)
You don't get it.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.236
You know, years ago,

31:44.236 --> 31:46.305
when BlueBell was leveled

31:46.305 --> 31:48.874
by that hurricane,
and people lost everything,

31:48.874 --> 31:50.943
most of all, they lost hope.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.544
They were talking
about moving out,

31:52.544 --> 31:55.347
deserting the town
and-and starting over,

31:55.347 --> 31:59.551
but the town's founder,
Cyrus Lavinius Jeremiah Jones,

31:59.551 --> 32:02.388
you know, he got together
with some of the town leaders.

32:02.388 --> 32:03.522
They spent

32:03.522 --> 32:05.057
the whole night fishing,

32:05.057 --> 32:08.094
and the next morning,
there was food for everyone.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.862
Yeah. Then, when people asked,

32:10.862 --> 32:12.598
"Where did it all come from?"

32:12.598 --> 32:16.302
that's when Cyrus made up that
story about friendly pirates.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.570
I knew there weren't pirates.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.240
Yeah, no pirates.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.841
Just neighbor
helping neighbor.

32:22.841 --> 32:24.243
That's what got

32:24.243 --> 32:26.645
BlueBell back upon
its feet then, after Katrina,

32:26.645 --> 32:29.115
after whatever came to
try and knock her down.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.516
You know what?

32:30.516 --> 32:32.551
Like, the costumes,
the pirate stuff--

32:32.551 --> 32:34.453
that's all just meant
to be fun.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.655
This holiday is really
about community.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.460
Yeah.

32:43.862 --> 32:45.264
LEMON:
Dad?
Mm?

32:45.264 --> 32:47.466
Do you play tennis?
Why do you ask?

32:47.466 --> 32:48.667
I was thinking

32:48.667 --> 32:51.003
we should join a doubles
tennis league in Montgomery.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.338
I don't know how to play,

32:52.338 --> 32:54.873
but I was hoping that
you could teach me.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.143
Wouldn't that be a kick?

32:57.143 --> 33:00.046
Hey.
CLORA:
Oh, there you two are.

33:00.046 --> 33:01.947
We have reservations
for a celebration dinner

33:01.947 --> 33:04.750
at Fancie's in ten minutes.
I know, and I'm sorry
to have to do this,

33:04.750 --> 33:06.885
but... y'all are gonna
have to go without us.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.154
I've got a client
who needs help.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.821
What client?
You're working for me now.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.024
I'm sorry. Did you not hear
someone needs his help?

33:12.024 --> 33:14.426
Look, Dad, this is
really important, okay?

33:14.426 --> 33:16.295
So y'all are gonna have
to go without us tonight,

33:16.295 --> 33:18.030
and we'll see you back
here in the morning?

33:18.030 --> 33:20.032
Mm-hmm.
Okay. You okay, babe?

33:20.032 --> 33:22.168
Mm-hmm!

33:22.168 --> 33:24.036
Oh, that is just perfect.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.304
More time together!

33:25.304 --> 33:26.572
You'd better get used to me,

33:26.572 --> 33:29.375
because you and I
are gonna be inseparable.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.377
(giggles)

33:32.144 --> 33:33.912
* *

33:33.912 --> 33:35.114
WADE:
 So...

33:35.914 --> 33:38.117
Finally.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.919
Here we are.

33:40.919 --> 33:43.122
You and me.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.024
On our way to the airport...

33:46.024 --> 33:47.459
Yes, sir.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.428
Mom, call me when
you get this message.

33:49.428 --> 33:50.896
There's been a change of plans.

33:50.896 --> 33:53.031
Bye.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.033
Will you take me
to the plantation?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.002
But the airport.

33:57.002 --> 33:58.337
I need to talk
to Lavon.

33:58.337 --> 34:00.072
George and Brick are helping
the family business.

34:00.072 --> 34:02.274
I need to help Caleb.

34:05.010 --> 34:06.812
Hey, it's okay.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.848
You'll just have to go
to the airport without me.

34:09.848 --> 34:13.051
* *

34:19.056 --> 34:20.525
GEORGE:
Whew, last one.

34:20.525 --> 34:21.493
BRICK:
Whoo.

34:21.493 --> 34:24.763
No sleep, but I think
it was worth it.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.032
Yeah, and nice touch
with that signet ring.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.867
(doorbell rings)

34:28.867 --> 34:31.469
Well...
(sighs)

34:31.469 --> 34:34.473
Good morning, Clora, Harold,
come on in.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.674
Ah.

34:35.674 --> 34:38.344
Correct me

34:38.344 --> 34:41.213
if I'm wrong,
but didn't we agree

34:41.213 --> 34:43.782
to have Thanksgiving today?

34:43.782 --> 34:44.949
I've prepared a meal.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.485
I know,
I-I'm really sorry,

34:46.485 --> 34:47.686
but something important
came up.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.087
It turns out
that Shady Hilson was--

34:49.087 --> 34:51.022
he was going to close
his hardware shop,

34:51.022 --> 34:52.424
so Brick and I--

34:52.424 --> 34:54.260
well, we spent the whole
night calling all over town

34:54.260 --> 34:55.927
and looking for
help, and, well,

34:55.927 --> 34:58.697
you see these?

34:58.697 --> 35:02.301
All pledges to buy exclusively
from Nate's Hardware.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.002
Yeah, it should be
enough to keep him

35:04.002 --> 35:05.404
up and running for
a good long time.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.605
Lawyers don't beg for money,

35:06.605 --> 35:09.308
especially on behalf
of a man too stupid

35:09.308 --> 35:11.443
to manage his own finances.
BRICK:
Whoa.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.379
I'm not sure you heard,
Harold, but there are a lot

35:13.379 --> 35:14.846
of good folks
that are struggling these days.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.482
And since when
did helping

35:16.482 --> 35:18.317
your neighbor turn
into a character flaw?

35:18.317 --> 35:19.651
Well, I'm just saying,

35:19.651 --> 35:21.387
in order to be a good
lawyer, you have to learn

35:21.387 --> 35:22.921
how to separate the personal
from the professional,

35:22.921 --> 35:26.192
and, and my son is
occasionally too soft-hearted

35:26.192 --> 35:27.593
for his own good.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.695
Then what exactly are you
proud of me for, Dad, huh?

35:29.695 --> 35:30.896
Oh, George, calm down.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.531
You know, it's very hard
to take you seriously

35:32.531 --> 35:34.132
when you're
in that ridiculous getup.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.401
Hmm.

35:35.401 --> 35:37.169
LEMON: Oh, there
you are, Clora.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.738
I have an extra costume
picked out just for you.

35:39.738 --> 35:42.374
We can be
mother-daughter pirates.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.909
I am not wearing
a pirate costume,

35:43.909 --> 35:46.011
and we are eating
Thanksgiving dinner.

35:46.011 --> 35:47.346
LEMON:
Oh,

35:47.346 --> 35:48.580
didn't George tell you?

35:48.580 --> 35:50.549
Plans have changed,
and you would look

35:50.549 --> 35:52.651
so cute
in an eye patch, Mama.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.454
For the love of God,
stop calling me that!

35:57.889 --> 35:59.958
(sighs)

35:59.958 --> 36:05.030
How my George came from your
loins, I have no earthly idea.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.698
How dare you?

36:06.698 --> 36:07.633
How dare I?

36:07.633 --> 36:10.436
My mother may not be
around anymore,

36:10.436 --> 36:11.803
but I am not desperate enough

36:11.803 --> 36:13.639
to replace her
with a conniving witch like you.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.807
Using a person's
vulnerabilities

36:15.807 --> 36:18.977
to manipulate them is just--
it's downright un-Christian.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.011
Watch your mouth,
young lady.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.547
And you!

36:21.547 --> 36:24.250
If you can't be proud of George,
who is the most decent

36:24.250 --> 36:26.285
and honorable man
that I have ever met,

36:26.285 --> 36:27.386
well, then
both of you

36:27.386 --> 36:31.223
can go
to H-E-double-hockey-sticks.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.729
I should have known
that this

36:37.729 --> 36:39.431
was about what
the two of you wanted

36:39.431 --> 36:41.633
'cause it always is.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.203
Dad, I officially decline
your offer.

36:51.543 --> 36:56.348
Oh, uh, Happy Planksgiving.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.921
* Yeah-eah-eah *

37:04.956 --> 37:06.892
* Ye-Yeah-eah-eah *

37:09.361 --> 37:12.097
* I like to hold
your hand up high *

37:12.097 --> 37:15.567
* On the Ferris wheel *

37:16.935 --> 37:19.705
* And how front porch swingin' *

37:19.705 --> 37:22.341
* With you makes me feel *

37:22.341 --> 37:25.577
* Yeah, but when you... *

37:25.577 --> 37:29.114
Come on, honey, you
need to eat something.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.783
I'm not hungry.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.052
Hey, the peg-legged race
is coming up.

37:34.052 --> 37:35.053
Maybe we should enter.

37:35.053 --> 37:37.656
Can I just go home now?

37:37.656 --> 37:39.224
Sure, buddy,

37:39.224 --> 37:40.692
let's go.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.895
* Crankin' up
Waylon, Willie, and Merle... *

37:43.895 --> 37:45.531
Avast ye, mateys.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.366
(band stops playing)
Methinks the Hilsons

37:47.366 --> 37:48.634
are trying to make
a fast getaway.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.369
Oh, I think you're right
there, Captain.

37:50.369 --> 37:54.640
I'm, uh, I'm sorry, folks, but
Caleb's wanting to go home.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.275
Well, I think we'd
like you to stay.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.345
As a matter
of fact...

37:59.345 --> 38:02.748
we'd like you to stay
permanently.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.359
This is a contract for the
new gym at the high school.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.765
For the Town Hall
renovation.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.368
Yeah, now,
there's more than enough there

38:22.368 --> 38:23.635
to, to make things right.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.904
BRICK:
BlueBell is
behind you, Shady,

38:25.904 --> 38:27.439
100%.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.007
(cheering)

38:29.007 --> 38:30.442
ZOE:
Ahoy!

38:30.442 --> 38:32.411
Uh, uh, actually, it's "avast."

38:32.411 --> 38:34.380
I am a Jewish pirate.
Ach-hoy!

38:34.380 --> 38:35.581
I am looking

38:35.581 --> 38:38.717
for a pirate named
Captain No Beard.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.318
Hi, Dr. Hart.
Oh, hello there.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.320
I found this hidden
near my carriage house.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.322
Thought you could
decipher it.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.323
Treasure map?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.893
(crowd murmuring)

38:47.893 --> 38:50.228
(band resumes playing)

38:50.228 --> 38:55.601
* Yeah, but when you pull up
in your big old truck *

38:55.601 --> 38:58.704
* I can't climb up in it
fast enough *

38:58.704 --> 39:01.339
* 'Cause I'm your shotgun girl *

39:01.339 --> 39:03.308
* Along for the ride... *

39:03.308 --> 39:04.643
(crowd murmuring)

39:13.218 --> 39:15.954
(gasping and excited murmurs)

39:15.954 --> 39:17.456
(applause)

39:17.456 --> 39:19.525
Caleb, I guess
you were right.

39:19.525 --> 39:22.628
There is treasure
right here in BlueBell.

39:22.628 --> 39:26.465
Me name be
Small Cal No Beard.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.333
(chuckles)
Oh.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.702
But my friends
just call me Cap'n.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.205
Come here, Cap'n.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.240
(chuckles)

39:35.240 --> 39:36.508
BECKY:
Get over here.

39:36.508 --> 39:39.845
Come here, Caleb.
(Shady growls)

39:41.246 --> 39:43.381
(sighs)
I have never been more proud

39:43.381 --> 39:44.816
of you,
George.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.853
You sure you don't regret
saying no to your dad?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.187
Corporate lawyers
are a dime a dozen,

39:49.187 --> 39:51.056
but I couldn't help
thinking about BlueBell.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.625
What would happen if
I closed up shop here?

39:53.625 --> 39:56.628
I mean, these people are more
than my neighbors, you know,

39:56.628 --> 39:58.497
they're my friends.
(chuckles)

39:58.497 --> 40:01.266
And I could not leave
them if I wanted to.

40:01.266 --> 40:03.401
(both chuckle)

40:06.805 --> 40:08.139
Where'd you go last night?

40:08.139 --> 40:09.274
Where else?

40:09.274 --> 40:11.176
The airport.

40:11.176 --> 40:14.145
I'm still stuffed
from all those cinnamon rolls.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.781
(laughs)

40:15.781 --> 40:16.948
No.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.595
Thought you were leaving.

40:29.595 --> 40:31.329
I just want you
to know, George,

40:31.329 --> 40:33.532
that I was trying
to help you.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.967
Towns like BlueBell
are dying off.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.369
Pretty soon you won't have
any more little guys to help.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.305
Yeah, well,
you know what?

40:40.305 --> 40:41.840
I think we'll be
just fine.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.441
I wouldn't be so sure.

40:44.843 --> 40:48.980
My firm represents a certain
big chain megastore.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.449
They're securing land
outside of town.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.018
I was hoping a man
inside BlueBell

40:53.018 --> 40:57.455
might help facilitate dealings
with the townspeople.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.990
You were going to use me?

40:58.990 --> 41:00.125
Face it,
George,

41:00.125 --> 41:02.027
the world is changing,
you got to change with it.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.061
Did you really think

41:03.061 --> 41:04.630
that your, your
little hardware store

41:04.630 --> 41:06.898
was going to be able to
compete with a mega-chain?

41:06.898 --> 41:09.467
* *

41:15.974 --> 41:18.510
Dr. Hart.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.511
Brick.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.179
You did real good today.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.715
Thank you, it feels good.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.050
Well, enjoy
that feeling

41:25.050 --> 41:28.053
'cause the new quarter
starts today.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.055
(laughs)

41:30.055 --> 41:32.658
* *

41:32.658 --> 41:37.062
