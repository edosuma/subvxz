WEBVTT

00:04.087 --> 00:06.423
That's it. A little bit
lower with the hands there, Ken.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.884
Beautiful. Fantastic. Perfect.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.095
Press yourself right up
against her, Ken.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.639
There it is. Beautiful.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.266
There you go. Excellent.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.518
Carina, sweetheart. Shoulder,
open up into me.

00:18.601 --> 00:19.728
There you go.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.647
I got what I need. Let's move on.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.192
Ken, are... Is everything okay?

00:26.943 --> 00:29.029
Yeah. Never been better.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.454
-Max.
-It's Freddy.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.955
You can make that clear
for your name-tag

00:39.039 --> 00:40.373
when you're cutting hair at the mall.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.083
In the meantime, get Corina a wig.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.462
I'm sorry, Miss Burke.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.256
I know I've done it before, but um...

00:48.715 --> 00:50.300
I don't want to wear wigs anymore.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.178
I have the greatest respect
for your magazine, but...

00:53.261 --> 00:54.929
this is who I am, and...

00:55.847 --> 00:57.348
I feel really good about it.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.102
If you need to replace me,

01:01.978 --> 01:03.021
I understand.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.192
Fine.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.235
Go.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.282
Let's go! This light
won't capture itself.

01:14.824 --> 01:17.035
Corina, love, please smile.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.845
Morning, beautiful.

02:20.014 --> 02:24.519
Wow. I guess we made the most
of Kayla being at that sleepover.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.397
Didn't we just go to sleep?

02:27.480 --> 02:28.982
Yeah, we did.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.568
But a good, healthy breakfast
should help us get going.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.072
Some lentil granola
with some grated carrots.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.575
That should hit the spot, right?

02:39.409 --> 02:40.785
And I know a place, too.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.495
It's called my kitchen.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.082
And I deliver to the bedroom.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.501
Oh, that sounds healthy, but...

02:48.835 --> 02:50.712
I have the breakfast shift at work.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.505
How about lunch instead?

02:53.089 --> 02:54.674
Rosie, you don't have to do that.

02:54.924 --> 02:55.800
Do what?

02:55.884 --> 02:59.012
Make a lunch date with me
then cancel because of work.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.181
Come on. No. Me?

03:01.764 --> 03:03.474
Cancel for work? Come on.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.768
Okay, all right.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.147
I've been bad in the past,
but today is gonna be you, me,

03:09.230 --> 03:11.024
and quinoa makes three.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.650
I promise.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.198
People see a skull like mine,
all they can see is tragedy.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.408
But I look at it, and...

03:20.491 --> 03:22.118
all I can be is grateful.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.413
-You're good.
-Yeah?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.290
Really good.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.891
Do you mind if I join you?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.103
I mind if you don't.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.578
What happened to your breakfast shift?

04:06.329 --> 04:07.956
They're lousy tippers.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.512
That was so much fun!

04:22.595 --> 04:23.805
Takes a lot of work.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.223
- You didn't look tired.
- You know me.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.933
I've been looking
at those muscles.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.438
-Good morning.
-Next time you want to listen

04:32.522 --> 04:34.190
to Color Me Badd all night,

04:34.524 --> 04:35.984
remember someone else lives here, too.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.194
Not a fan.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.953
Why don't you go to the store. I think
we need some more half-and-half.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.664
There's some right here.

04:53.668 --> 04:54.669
Okay?

04:54.752 --> 04:56.879
And we'll listen to more
Color Me Badd tonight.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.631
- Okay, you promise?
- I promise.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.383
Okay. I'll go to the store.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.843
But I'm on bass next time.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.471
-I can't wait.
-Do that turn.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.015
Like this?

05:08.266 --> 05:09.183
I can't wait.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.311
-Bye.
-Bye.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.902
Listen, Ma, I know you want
me to be happy, but...

05:21.279 --> 05:23.406
I'm just not ready
to look for Mr. Right.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.075
But what's wrong with looking
for Mr. Right Now?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.453
Ma, what are you planning?

05:28.536 --> 05:29.787
Nothing for you
to worry about, Mihika.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.917
Looks like your plan's
gonna have to wait.

05:55.271 --> 05:58.232
I'd say good morning, but it looks like
you're about four hours short on sleep.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.609
Insomnia?

06:00.109 --> 06:01.444
Let's go with that.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.821
Insomnia's got ears, you know.
And feelings.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.615
What's going on with you?

06:05.698 --> 06:07.825
What do you mean? Nothing. I'm fine.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.453
Yeah. You see, to most people
it would seem that way, but...

06:10.536 --> 06:12.372
there's something off.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.249
I mean, you should be happy
you're in a new relationship.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.086
You're happy all the time, even when
you're not in a relationship.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.465
I know a thing or two
about being attached.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.217
Might not feel good
while it's happening

06:24.300 --> 06:25.718
but it doesn't mean it's unhealthy.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.303
What I heard last night was unhealthy.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.889
Listen, all I'm saying is
you like this woman.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.308
So it's okay for you to put
all your cards on the table.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.728
Except the IBS. That you can hold on
to till you know she's the one.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.234
I'm your friend, okay?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.027
If something bothers you,
it bothers me.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.571
What about when I bother you
and it bothers me that I bother you?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.824
All right, well, I'm just gonna
walk ahead here.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.244
The point is, if you're not
as Rosalicious,

06:51.411 --> 06:53.121
Rosie suffers. Oh, God,
did I just say that?

06:53.204 --> 06:55.748
It seems to be rubbing off on you.
Don't fight it, embrace it.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.334
Or could it be you're afraid things
are moving too fast with Tawnya?

06:58.459 --> 07:00.253
Or could it be freeing
an innocent man from prison

07:00.336 --> 07:01.796
for two murders
he didn't commit thing.

07:01.879 --> 07:02.797
All right. That thing.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.048
Yeah, that thing.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.847
Oh, state of the art security.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.349
Whoever lives here
was scared of someone.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.476
This model's the one that lives here.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.228
Maybe she's scared of
whoever did this.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.980
Looks like they left some DNA behind.

07:23.901 --> 07:24.944
Guys.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.327
I've seen a lot of
creepy customers in my day.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.329
But that takes the prize.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.879
Someone posed her like a doll.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.922
And added her to her own collection.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.860
Holy mother of symmetry.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.153
This is you?

08:08.279 --> 08:09.322
With a little reverb.

08:09.405 --> 08:13.117
You know, isn't it funny how
the word "reverb" is actually a noun?

08:14.035 --> 08:15.369
Good morning, everyone.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.163
I heard Mitchie say
something white again.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.331
When does he not?

08:19.790 --> 08:20.791
Carina Radnor.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.543
Yeah, she won the genetic lottery.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.003
I'm not so sure about that.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.838
Scar tissue around her lips
and septum.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.883
Incision marks on the outer thigh.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.468
She had help from the scalpel.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.762
Who am I to judge?
There was a time where a

08:32.845 --> 08:35.181
decent pair of butt implants
would've saved my marriage.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.184
-Wait, what?
-Whose butt?

08:38.267 --> 08:39.936
-Is this true, Mitchie?
-Which part?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.145
-All of it.
-All the parts.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.191
Did a clown show up at my place
last week? Yes.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.068
Did I let him in?
Of course. Who wouldn't?

08:47.610 --> 08:48.444
It's a clown.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.154
But it was after 9:00 PM,

08:50.238 --> 08:52.365
so I should've realized
that something was suspicious.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.992
I'm so worried right now.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.287
He was a process server.
Giggles was his name.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.790
He served me my divorce papers.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.543
Talk about a past relationship
coming back to haunt you.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.712
Bottom line, this guy,
pointing at myself,

09:06.921 --> 09:08.714
knows a thing or two
about men and lady stuff,

09:08.798 --> 09:11.217
or lady-lady stuff, for that matter.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.552
Kind of an expert.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.096
So, if anyone, and now
I'm pointing at the three of you,

09:15.179 --> 09:16.889
need advice in the love world--

09:16.973 --> 09:18.015
-We don't.
-We do not.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.141
Nobody does.

09:19.475 --> 09:20.560
Are you okay?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.520
I mean, we could talk it out
if you'd like.

09:22.603 --> 09:25.648
No. I don't think I'm emotionally
available for that yet.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.944
Yeah, we should get back to work.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.070
Yes.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.697
Plastic surgery addiction.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.907
I mean that could be one
on a laundry list of things.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.200
Run a full tox.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.743
There's a smudge on her dress.

09:37.827 --> 09:38.869
Looks like make-up.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.162
Makes sense, she was a model.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.497
Get the brand name and shade.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.124
Make sure it matches
what Carina's wearing.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.585
Yes. We will use
near-infrared spectroscopy to compare?

09:49.171 --> 09:51.048
Blunt force
trauma to the skull.

09:51.132 --> 09:54.010
Could have been what killed her.
Get X-rays to check for fractures.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.928
Cheek lacerations,
facial fractures.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.472
Just find out everything that was done
to Carina's body when she was alive.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.017
That could lead us
to our cause of death.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.521
Is it me or is this the best looking
suspect pool we ever had?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.274
A little more rest, little more zinc,
you'll be right there with 'em.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.483
Get out of here. Really?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.277
Okay, a lot, lot more zinc.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.863
Got the DNA results from the blood
you found on Carina's wall.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.616
Unfortunately, it didn't match her
or anyone in the system.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.952
But I was able to get the security
footage from her place last night.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.039
Oh great. Our killer's an LED lamp.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.499
No, our killer didn't want their face
caught on a security camera.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.543
Carina did disarm the locks
in her apartment

10:27.627 --> 10:29.337
right after this video was taken.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.047
-So--
-She knew her killer.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.633
Which is why I made a timeline
of her last 24 hours.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.636
She did a photo shoot
with Haute fashion magazine.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.512
Well that explains the make up
that was on her dress.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.222
Brand name Sunkiss, shade number four.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.016
It was just one shade darker
than what Carina was wearing.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.727
Now we just have to figure out
which one of our gorgeous suspects

10:44.810 --> 10:45.895
was Sunkiss number four.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.939
Witnesses said Carina had a fight
with the editor, Ronda Burke.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.274
I'm gonna go talk to her now.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.109
- Count me in.
- Okay.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.741
Rosie? Not feeling the need
to crash this interrogation?

10:58.908 --> 11:01.285
Well, you know that I'm all about
the third wheel trio,

11:01.369 --> 11:04.205
but I'm... actually promised Tawnya
I wouldn't cancel our lunch.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.833
Don't tell me you've found
a healthy work-life balance.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.043
Guilty as charged.

11:09.877 --> 11:10.711
Good for you.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.006
But I'll let you know when
the full tox comes back on the victim.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.257
Thanks.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.973
You know your mom has got me
keeping up with all the Haute fashion.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.727
You know, for the articles.
Not bad. Not bad at all.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.521
How are things going with her?

11:28.604 --> 11:30.898
Let's just say your mom knows
all about my IBS.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.776
Call Charles,
get me a court for tomorrow,

11:33.859 --> 11:35.778
and fire that photographer
I mentioned three weeks ago.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.447
I'll have the ropa vieja
from Palador Vistamor for lunch.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.703
Detective Annalise Villa,
East Miami PD.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.913
Detective Ira Hornstock, big fan.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.582
We need to ask you a few questions
about Carina Radnor.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.376
-She was murdered last night.
-Good.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.669
Excuse me?

11:51.752 --> 11:53.421
Next month's layout is here.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.632
Hey, did you... Did you not hear us?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.718
Murdered, last night, Carina.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.970
And we heard you fought with her
at a photo shoot yesterday.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.889
It was my shoot. And yes,
we had a tiff, which was odd.

12:03.973 --> 12:04.974
Why is that?

12:05.057 --> 12:07.810
For someone with such good looks,
Carina wasn't very confident.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.020
If a doormat had a doormat
it would've been Carina.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.022
Yesterday was the first time
she ever stood up to me.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.441
It must have been something important.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.151
She refused to wear a wig.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.862
It's not like
that's a motive for murder.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.823
Where were you last night?

12:20.906 --> 12:24.034
At a fund raiser for hungry children,
where 300 other people saw me.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.745
So, no, I did not kill Carina.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.079
She ticked you off, though.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.539
I discovered Carina.

12:28.622 --> 12:31.333
I made her the best model
in this town.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.211
She had fans
who were obsessed with her.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.421
But had she lived,

12:35.880 --> 12:37.298
she never would've
worked for me again.

12:37.381 --> 12:40.259
You think any of her fans crossed
the line from obsession to murder?

12:41.093 --> 12:43.637
There was a man who just
missed handsome at the shoot.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.723
I think he'd been removed
from the set a few times.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.559
Gave off quite the stalker vibe.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.811
That description come with
a hair color, maybe?

12:51.228 --> 12:53.230
He had a forgettable face,
so I forgot him.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.276
You on the other hand
are a prime example of symmetry.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.570
-If you're interested...
-Thank you for your time, Miss Brooke.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.363
Symmetry.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.535
Hey, thought we had
a lunch date at one o'clock.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.955
Just calling to make sure
you're all right. Let me know.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.966
Hey. How was your date?

13:21.550 --> 13:24.136
Tried the two dollar Tuesday taquitos
at the place I told you about?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.764
Or did you skip the acid reflux
and go straight to the sac?

13:27.515 --> 13:29.183
-Sorry. Yeah, I know.
-Inappropriate.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.477
For the record, I never get to
skip the acid reflux.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.355
Tawnya stood me up. Said she forgot.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.900
Wow. For the first time,

13:37.983 --> 13:39.902
suddenly the three of you
have nothing to say. Interesting.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.488
No, it sounds like maybe
she pulled a Rosie.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.448
Come on, you know, peacing out

13:44.532 --> 13:46.200
before she has to make
any long term commitments.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.244
Okay, I have never "pulled a Rosie."

13:48.327 --> 13:49.954
If that were true,
it wouldn't be named after you.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.164
Maybe you failed the single mom test.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.750
-The what?
-Yeah. You're an intelligent man

13:54.834 --> 13:57.461
with a successful business,
you're fit, handsome, wealthy.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.130
If I'm turning green it's the light
and it's not jealousy.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.759
But Tawnya still has to make sure
that you're good father material.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.010
Wow, nobody panic.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.221
Mitchie might be going through
a very weird non-divorce,

14:07.304 --> 14:08.222
but you have a point.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.641
All right, cycle through
the last 48 hours.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.685
What did you do wrong?

14:12.768 --> 14:15.020
Okay, you guys are overreacting
to the situation.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.147
Tawnya and I are fine. We're fine.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.482
Okay? Good.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.819
All right, so what is this body
telling us?

14:22.903 --> 14:25.155
Okay, so radio dense callouses,

14:25.239 --> 14:27.741
coupled with smooth fractures
on her nasal bone

14:27.825 --> 14:30.661
indicate that Carina had a rhinoplasty
within the last month.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.288
Collagen in her
lips indicates that

14:32.371 --> 14:34.248
she had a refill
in the last several weeks.

14:34.331 --> 14:38.335
And the breast implants presenting
with yellowish brown discoloration

14:38.419 --> 14:40.671
and scarring indicate
an older procedure.

14:40.754 --> 14:42.756
And we also examined the calvarium

14:42.840 --> 14:45.009
and facial skeleton to determine
the extent of trauma.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.052
No damage to the cranial vault.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.847
Bingo. But what we did find
were shattered orbital bones.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.225
Whoever was with her last night
really worked her over.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.560
Could you hand me the...

14:54.643 --> 14:56.478
Hand-held X-ray. I'm way ahead of you.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.107
Whoever attacked her used their fists.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.360
Check out the patterned injuries
superior to the left orbital ridge.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.195
Spacing is consistent
with knuckles.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.364
Bones in the orbital rim
aren't easy to shatter.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.409
So it's likely our perp injured
his own hand in the process.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.536
But this trauma alone
wouldn't be enough to kill her.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.871
We still need a cause of death.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.666
Remodeled fractures along the skull
and the face.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.961
And healed peri-fractures
from warding off the aggressor.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.926
Last night wasn't the first time
Carina was attacked.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.302
And I think I know who attacked her.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.970
Ronda mentioned a stalker
at the shoot.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.889
Turns out Carina filed
a restraining order

15:31.972 --> 15:33.682
last month against Andrew Myers.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.975
I put a track and trace on his cell.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.310
He's one of her obsessed fans?

15:36.393 --> 15:37.519
That's what I thought at first.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.521
Then I found the wedding website
he shared with Carina

15:39.605 --> 15:40.773
right before they broke up.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.692
Andrew isn't just a stalker.
He was Carina's fiance.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.194
Carina was a victim of domestic abuse.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.238
And the track and trace just put her
abuser on the same block as her loft.

15:54.578 --> 15:55.871
Back up.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.083
Stay away, please!

16:00.834 --> 16:02.127
Just let me do this.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.306
Carina's dead.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.850
Why should I have to live?

16:17.434 --> 16:19.311
He's forgetting the part
where he might've killed her.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.648
Yeah, it's not surprising, considering
he's exhibiting constricted pupils,

16:22.731 --> 16:24.566
perspiration to myoclonic jerks.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.193
Translation?

16:26.276 --> 16:28.654
He's riding high
off a methane-opiate cocktail

16:28.737 --> 16:31.407
that will render him unstable
even if he wasn't holding a gun.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.326
Andrew. Andrew, listen to me.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.995
You're a good person.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.454
Deep down, yes, you are.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.082
I can't fix this. Nobody can fix this.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.084
Come on, Andrew.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.711
You pull that trigger,
you'll never get to read

16:43.794 --> 16:45.129
the letters Carina wrote you.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.463
What letters?

16:47.047 --> 16:48.716
The letters where
she said she loved you.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.343
That she forgave you.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.678
Forgave me for what?

16:53.220 --> 16:54.555
For loving her so much.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.855
There we go.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.941
Now, Andrew, do me a favor
and drop the gun.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.987
Slowly put your hands
behind your back.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.074
-When can I see the letters?
-Never.

17:14.408 --> 17:15.325
They don't exist.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.745
And because we believe
you killed Carina, they never will.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.206
Or we can't get an admissible confession
until you sober up.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.708
Guess you'll be
spending the night in holding.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.709
Pick on someone your own size.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.377
Or try to, anyway.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.355
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.152
I um...

17:50.861 --> 17:52.196
I'm really sorry about today.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.864
Look, if we're going too fast--

17:53.947 --> 17:56.492
No, no. That's not it. It's...

17:57.284 --> 17:58.786
It's just...

17:59.328 --> 18:01.747
Whatever it is, we can discuss it.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.791
What is it?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.628
My ex-husband

18:08.420 --> 18:10.631
said that if I don't
come back to him...

18:13.217 --> 18:15.302
...he said he would...

18:15.844 --> 18:17.429
-Did he hit you?
-No.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.264
He just says things.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.225
Let me know exactly what he said.

18:23.811 --> 18:24.978
That he would kill me.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.357
And I believe him.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.818
-Where's Kayla?
-At her friend's house.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.906
-Where are you going?
-To get your stuff.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.909
You and Kayla are gonna stay with me
until we solve this problem.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.835
We have a problem, Andrew.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.586
You were once engaged to our victim.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.422
Your DNA matches the sample we took
from the hole punched in her wall,

18:52.506 --> 18:54.049
and oh, right, she's dead.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.093
Carina put me through a lot.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.636
Oh...

18:57.719 --> 18:59.972
Did your little hand get hurt
when you punched her?

19:02.975 --> 19:04.184
You need to vent.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.520
There's something off with you,

19:06.979 --> 19:08.355
and I know what it is.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.567
I've been through my fair share
of relationships that move fast.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.819
I'm ready to listen.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.779
Tawnya and Kayla moved in.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.449
Wow... You took my advice,
you went all in.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.243
-I like it.
-It's only temporary.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.747
Her ex-husband came back
and he threatened her life.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.708
So you didn't have a choice.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.335
Another man threatens your woman
or her child,

19:30.419 --> 19:32.129
you protect her at all costs.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.630
That's what I'm doing.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.758
Andrew, explain to me again
how you're the victim here.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.677
Before Carina's first procedure

19:38.760 --> 19:40.554
not a lot of guys would have
given her a second look.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.432
-I did.
-Lucky her.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.434
I got her out of her dad's house, too.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.144
She told me she'd never forget
that I was the one

19:47.227 --> 19:48.520
who rescued her from her father.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.315
So Carina left one abuser for another.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.317
It's the cycle of abuse.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.320
After one of our altercations--

19:56.486 --> 19:58.113
Come on, you mean
after you beat her up?

20:00.157 --> 20:03.660
But after, she had to
get her face fixed.

20:03.744 --> 20:08.498
She found this charity that gives
free plastic surgery to victims.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.666
Yeah, Operation Uplift.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.501
We've referred our patients
there before.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.670
She was hooked.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.797
It was like she couldn't stop
until they made her perfect.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.758
And she kicked it to the curb.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.968
Six months ago.
Left in the middle of the night.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.094
Didn't even say it to my face.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.804
Is that why you killed her?

20:23.680 --> 20:25.933
Because she dumped you
then became a big time model?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.062
You know, now that you're
rehashing all this,

20:30.145 --> 20:32.022
it's starting to become really clear.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.650
Carina, she wasn't worth it.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.194
She had her daddy demons
long before we ever met.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.363
Plastic surgery wasn't gonna fix that,
nothing would.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.198
She was damaged goods.

20:43.951 --> 20:44.910
Hey, Rosie.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.746
-Hey, hey.
-I got this.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.206
-No. I'm not moving.
-I got this.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.335
You know what I see
when I look at you, Andrew?

20:53.752 --> 20:55.254
I see a coward.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.673
A coward who thrives
on watching a woman

20:57.756 --> 20:59.591
he claims to love suffer at his hand.

21:03.011 --> 21:06.223
Carina's addiction,
her drive for perfection,

21:07.224 --> 21:08.725
that's all on you.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.895
You made her life hell.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.565
And I'm willing to bet that she would
rather die than ever go back to you.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.402
You're right.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.155
I went to see her that night
to tell her I'd changed.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.865
She didn't believe me,
I lost my temper.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.659
-And you hit her.
-No.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.202
I punched a wall instead.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.579
She just told me that
she was dating somebody else.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.665
I don't know who,
but I didn't kill her. I swear.

21:31.915 --> 21:32.958
Enough.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.680
Since when do you shop at
Hornstock's happy place?

21:46.763 --> 21:49.182
Since the department started giving
discounts on Mayday bars.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.977
Heat 'em up,
add a little whipped cream,

21:52.477 --> 21:53.353
gourmet junk food.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.105
No, no, you don't eat junk food.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.357
And you don't interrupt
my interrogation.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.526
Hey. Look at me.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.278
We're partners.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.571
We're friends.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.740
I need to know what's bothering you.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.784
Tawnya and Kayla moved in.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.619
What?

22:10.495 --> 22:13.457
Your girlfriend of two Saturdays
is living with you?

22:13.540 --> 22:15.751
Isn't that a little un-Rosie like?

22:15.834 --> 22:17.002
Might not be a bad thing.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.296
Okay, let's see.
Rosie's eating junk food,

22:19.713 --> 22:23.008
Rosie's going off on an abusive ex,
Tawnya has an ex.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.677
Tawnya moves in with Rosie real fast.

22:27.804 --> 22:28.972
Tawnya's ex came back.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.640
Yeah, and he threatened her life.

22:31.558 --> 22:35.562
So, Tawnya and Kayla are staying with me
until he's no longer a problem.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.898
Abusers don't go away,
so when will that be?

22:39.608 --> 22:43.111
Hey, so Forensics pulled pictures
of this guy off Carina's phone.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.030
He was at the photo shoot
the day Carina died.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.281
Ken Daltry, male model.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.532
Stay here, cool off.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.212
Ken Daltry?

23:00.587 --> 23:02.798
You're the tailors?
If so, you're super late.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.427
What? I've got good genes.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.887
Good genes aren't the problem.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.138
Your dead girl friend is.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.766
Funny, you don't strike me
as a boyfriend in mourning.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.686
Would you mind closing the door?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.736
Ronda doesn't know
that Carina and I were dating.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.989
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

23:28.073 --> 23:29.282
A few months.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.202
Carina, she was beautiful,
she was driven, she--

23:34.329 --> 23:36.748
She made me want to be better.
And now--

23:36.832 --> 23:38.625
How were things with you two
when she died?

23:38.875 --> 23:40.210
Better than ever.

23:40.836 --> 23:43.755
She had changed. There was this

23:44.256 --> 23:47.592
confidence there, like, she'd finally
become the person she wanted to be.

23:47.843 --> 23:48.969
Because of all the surgeries?

23:49.052 --> 23:51.513
No, because she was done
going under the knife.

23:52.514 --> 23:55.350
She wanted to free herself
from that search for perfection.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.728
We were gonna start a new life
together, away from Miami.

24:00.522 --> 24:01.940
Now we won't get that chance.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.196
Hey.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.990
So, get ready for
some more breaking news.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.700
Foreboding music, please.

24:11.783 --> 24:12.993
What? No.

24:13.743 --> 24:14.786
Acapella is.

24:15.245 --> 24:18.039
Okay, so Pippy found anesthetic
in Carina's system.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.499
So I took another look at a laceration

24:19.583 --> 24:21.251
that I thought was from the beating,
and it was,

24:21.334 --> 24:24.838
but underneath, I found a fresh
incision mark on her torso.

24:24.921 --> 24:28.008
So, Carina had liposuction
within 48 hours of her death.

24:28.091 --> 24:30.427
And we also found glue residue
on the epidermal layer

24:30.510 --> 24:33.555
above both scapulae,
triceps and posterior thighs.

24:33.638 --> 24:34.931
-Lidocaine patches.
-Yup.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.225
Over 13,000 milligrams
per liter in her system.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.770
The residue wasn't there
when Carina did her shoot.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.523
The patches were put there
by the killer the night of her murder.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.484
Carina died of an overdose.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.153
What we can't find is any evidence
linking Andrew to the attack.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.780
And I think I know why.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.284
Broken bones but no bruising,
cuts with no blood.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.994
Carina was already dead
when the killer beat her up.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.205
Andrew didn't kill her but someone
wanted to make it look like he did.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.373
Someone who had access
to lidocaine patches.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.125
You mean, someone like a surgeon?

25:02.375 --> 25:03.710
I mean someone like a surgeon.

25:09.966 --> 25:12.135
I'll be sure to let you know
when I have that warrant.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.472
That was Chase Rollins,
the director of Operation Uplift.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.516
The charity that set Carina
with her first plastic surgeon.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.683
One and only.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.602
He was very co-operative,
at least when he thought

25:20.685 --> 25:22.854
I was calling about the charities'
annual fund raiser tomorrow.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.106
And the theme is "Be your best self."

25:25.190 --> 25:26.566
-I like it.
-You would.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.027
Only in Miami,
look pretty, look perfect.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.780
Hand over the big check
and eat unlimited caviar.

25:31.863 --> 25:32.739
So what time should I pick you up?

25:32.822 --> 25:36.409
No, no. I'm not rubbing lifted elbows
with Miami's elite

25:36.493 --> 25:37.536
just so you can get all dressed up.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.913
Come on, Villa, everybody knows
you catch more killers with caviar.

25:39.996 --> 25:41.915
-Everybody does not know that.
-Okay, expert.

25:41.998 --> 25:44.209
Did the charity director give you
the information that you wanted?

25:44.292 --> 25:45.794
He would have if it weren't for HIPAA.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.463
I guess he's worried
he has a killer surgeon

25:48.547 --> 25:50.048
operating in the name of his charity.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.716
-So you got shut down.
-I did not get--

25:51.800 --> 25:53.969
Shut down. Yes, you did. But listen,
we may not need the warrant.

25:54.469 --> 25:55.929
I can track Carina's parts.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.265
"Parts"? You mean, like cheeks?

25:58.348 --> 25:59.724
I mean, like, both kinds.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.769
Each implant has a serial number
that can be traced back

26:02.852 --> 26:04.229
to the doctor
that performed the procedure.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.940
Now, if we tracked her implants...

26:07.023 --> 26:09.150
We catch the person responsible
for Carina's death.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.695
And we figure out why a doctor,
who's sworn to do no harm

26:11.778 --> 26:13.196
would use plastic surgery as murder.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.032
But isn't it obvious, whoever did this
is obsessed with Carina.

26:16.116 --> 26:19.202
Why else would the killer pose her
like a doll in her own collection?

26:19.286 --> 26:21.162
Well, if she met the surgeons
at this charity,

26:21.246 --> 26:23.373
I'll bet they'll be there tomorrow
at the fund raiser.

26:23.456 --> 26:24.666
And one of them is our killer.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.002
Pick you up at noon?

26:27.544 --> 26:28.962
Come on, unlimited caviar.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.672
-Unlimited.
-If I say yes, will you go away?

26:30.755 --> 26:31.881
No.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.883
Well, initially I will
because I have dinner plans.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.470
Tomorrow, 12 noon.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.931
Cocktail attire. Pick you up.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.141
Fine.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.483
What you think, mami?

26:52.611 --> 26:54.779
You look like you could be
on reality TV.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.032
Stop it!
You're putting ideas in my head!

26:57.115 --> 26:58.325
I love it!

26:59.576 --> 27:01.119
Tonight is not about me.

27:01.244 --> 27:03.288
It's all about you.

27:03.663 --> 27:05.582
And you can go anywhere.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.501
No, please tell me you're not taking
me to meet a man at a wake again.

27:08.585 --> 27:12.964
Relax, it's gonna be a great
mother-daughter girls' night out.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.175
Okay? We're gonna have a few drinks,

27:15.258 --> 27:16.885
and we're gonna shake our money maker.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.387
Please don't say that.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.264
No one says that anymore.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.726
-Come on. Please?
-Okay.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.813
We're gonna have fun.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.232
Pull this skirt down. It's so short.

27:31.566 --> 27:33.443
Don't get mad.
I may have invited some friends.

27:33.526 --> 27:36.154
-Ma.
-No fire fighters this time.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.573
-Hi!
-Surprise!

27:40.784 --> 27:43.119
-Oh, my God, she's very surprised.
-Very.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.788
No, the more the merrier.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.539
You guys look fab.

27:46.623 --> 27:47.666
Let's do this.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.502
So you put that into the equation
first and what do you get?

27:50.585 --> 27:52.879
Five X plus 12 equals seven.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.674
And X equals?

27:56.549 --> 27:58.468
X equals negative one.

27:59.469 --> 28:00.512
Negative what, what?

28:03.473 --> 28:07.185
Thank you. I haven't been able
to help her with math in years.

28:07.268 --> 28:09.104
Well, I actually can get used to this.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.022
Me, too.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.570
Holy implants, Batman.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.280
What's that about?

28:19.948 --> 28:22.534
Some work emergency, I think.
Sorry, I gotta go.

28:23.326 --> 28:24.994
-I'll be right back. All right?
-All right.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.792
What do you got for me, Robin?

28:30.875 --> 28:33.545
Yeah. Sorry about the glib audio text.

28:33.628 --> 28:36.756
I just go full nerd
in cases of exciting discoveries.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.883
So, it was difficult
to detect at first

28:38.967 --> 28:40.593
due to the lacerations
from the assault,

28:40.677 --> 28:43.888
but these are the sutures made
during the liposuction

28:43.972 --> 28:46.683
performed on Carina,
the night of her murder, right?

28:46.766 --> 28:50.061
And these were from her most recent
set of breast implants.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.230
And of course,
the view from the inside.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.482
Identical Connell sutures.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.317
Exactly. And it's not just these two.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.362
All of her implants and procedures
were stitched up with Connell sutures.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.865
So she didn't have a host of doctors,
she had one.

29:02.365 --> 29:03.783
And I think he may be our killer.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.535
-Good job.
-Thanks, man.

29:07.787 --> 29:08.788
It's gross.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.126
I hate giving advice.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.210
-No, you don't.
-You're right.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.879
I always say that. It's just not true.

29:15.962 --> 29:17.756
All right, fire away.
Just make it quick.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.425
I didn't want to get a divorce.

29:20.884 --> 29:25.263
Maggie did 'cause she had an affair
with a guy.

29:26.681 --> 29:27.682
Several guys.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.768
-Is this about me or this about you?
-Eventually, yes.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.603
But the preamble is about me. So...

29:32.645 --> 29:34.981
We were together for a decade, right?

29:35.064 --> 29:38.943
We started slow because we were both
scared that it might not work out.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.864
But in the end, it didn't matter
that we took it slow

29:42.947 --> 29:44.616
because it didn't work out anyway.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.494
-Now it's about me.
-Yes, it is, buddy.

29:48.119 --> 29:52.957
Listen, it's okay that Tawnya moved in
after only two weeks of dating.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.167
How do you know about that?

29:54.250 --> 29:56.419
Again, man, this is not about me.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.714
It's okay if her moving in
worries you.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.174
It's okay if it doesn't.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.385
Because time spent preparing to go
all in on a relationship

30:04.469 --> 30:08.097
has no bearing on whether or not that
relationship's actually gonna work out.

30:08.848 --> 30:12.227
All that matters is who you want
to be with at the end of the day.

30:12.852 --> 30:15.063
So you go ahead
and take it fast or slow.

30:15.522 --> 30:16.606
Slow or fast.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.196
Speaking of the end of the day,
where is Pippy and TMI?

30:23.738 --> 30:25.031
Girls night. They invited me,

30:25.114 --> 30:27.367
but I can't control myself
around pop music and mixed nuts.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.385
-Got nuts?
-You want to keep yours?

30:48.805 --> 30:50.682
Villa, what's wrong with you?

30:50.765 --> 30:52.016
Nothing, I'm fine.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.269
Fine does not threaten a man
with mixed nuts.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.896
Those snacks actually are probably
hepatitis waiting to happen.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.607
Come on, we're here to have fun
and we don't need men to do that.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.025
-I definitely don't.
-All right?

31:01.109 --> 31:04.070
But if in the process you meet
Mr. Right Now,

31:04.153 --> 31:05.321
so be it.

31:05.405 --> 31:08.616
Okay, so we're not like sugar coating
anything now, are we?

31:09.200 --> 31:10.577
I'm gonna need more Fresca.

31:12.912 --> 31:14.247
Okay, fine.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.332
-You want me to have fun?
-Yes!

31:16.416 --> 31:17.584
Fine.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.216
Don't wait up for me.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.719
-Okay.
-Oh, my gosh. Where are you going?

31:27.802 --> 31:29.053
Work, girl, work!

31:43.568 --> 31:44.986
Rosie. Hey.

31:45.069 --> 31:48.323
-Hey.
-So sorry my place is a mess.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.284
I see.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.745
Breakfast with Daisy?

31:53.828 --> 31:55.496
No, she's at Hornstock's.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.334
So I hope you're up
to being your best self

31:59.417 --> 32:02.462
because Rosilla is headed to
Operation Uplifts fund raiser

32:02.545 --> 32:04.839
to catch ourselves a killer.
You ready?

32:05.214 --> 32:06.466
Rosilla!

32:06.549 --> 32:08.009
That's catchy. I like it.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.553
-Dr. Webb.
-Dr. Rosewood, morning.

32:10.637 --> 32:11.930
Actually it's noon.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.681
Is it? Wow.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.059
Maybe the three of us
could grab lunch.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.602
I don't know, you like quinoa, right?

32:17.685 --> 32:19.771
Man, you are speaking
my language right now.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.189
Yes, I do.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.982
-Quinoa.
-Maybe some other time.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.150
We have a case thing.

32:24.233 --> 32:26.235
All right, well, I better get to work.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.363
That sucks. See ya.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.864
-Take care.
-Yeah.

32:32.367 --> 32:35.370
-Don't say anything.
-Anything. Anything.

32:35.453 --> 32:36.829
So you heading with me
to this fund raiser or not?

32:36.913 --> 32:38.039
Yes, I need ten minutes.

32:38.247 --> 32:39.540
Only ten?

32:39.624 --> 32:40.833
You haven't slept, you're dehydrated.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.710
You're talking to a graduate of

32:42.794 --> 32:45.046
the Daisy Villa School
of Hangover Crimping.

32:45.129 --> 32:47.757
-Give me ten minutes.
-I tracked Carina's implants.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.385
And they didn't lead me
to many doctors,

32:50.468 --> 32:53.471
it led me to one, Greg Hawking.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.515
So he did all of Carina's surgeries?

32:55.598 --> 32:56.933
Yep. And believe it or not,

32:57.016 --> 32:59.686
our good doctor is hosting
Operation Uplift's fund raiser.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.270
And I'm pretty sure he's our killer.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.576
See this is what I'm talking about.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.413
Dr. Hawking, he might be our killer
but he has the perfect setup.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.416
Whether it's performing surgeries
or hosting fund raisers.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.295
Office, OR. Complete recovery with
pool side chaise lounges and bars.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.297
Isn't it a bad idea to mix
pain meds and alcohol?

33:28.381 --> 33:29.924
Yes, very bad.

33:30.508 --> 33:33.511
But listen, Villa, before we activate
our plan to take Hawking down...

33:35.263 --> 33:36.389
You and Adrian last night.

33:39.600 --> 33:40.560
Amazing.

33:40.643 --> 33:44.063
Okay, let me stop you because
yes, it was amazing.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.649
But not in the way you mean it,
or amazing.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.443
So what was the "it"
that was so amazing?

33:48.526 --> 33:49.944
The whole night.

33:50.403 --> 33:53.197
We closed down the bar,
walked around the city,

33:53.281 --> 33:56.659
we came home, had breakfast,
I didn't want the night to end.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.327
Like I said, amazing.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.955
Well, now it's time to activate
our amazing plan.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.373
Right, right.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.543
Yup, there's Hawking. Let me go
chat him up, doctor to doctor.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.128
You mean ego to ego?

34:07.211 --> 34:10.131
Our searches fancy digs are proof
he was obsessed with Carina.

34:13.843 --> 34:15.845
Pardon me, Dr. Greg Hawking.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.348
Dr. Beaumont Rosewood, Jr.

34:19.682 --> 34:21.684
I followed your work for years.

34:21.768 --> 34:25.229
Likewise. Although, I can't claim your
expertise with a Connell suture.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.524
Or the way you just absolutely
annihilate scar tissue.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.109
Impressive, very impressive.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.986
Is there any chance
I can get a private tour?

34:32.070 --> 34:34.530
How can I say no
to an admirer? Please.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.914
Some really incredible photos.

34:43.372 --> 34:45.208
Your patients agreed
to pose for these?

34:45.291 --> 34:47.168
-Just one.
-And which one is that?

34:47.251 --> 34:49.253
You know her. You worked on her, too.

34:50.046 --> 34:51.130
Carina Radnor.

34:51.214 --> 34:54.217
The first time she came to see me
her fiance had

34:54.300 --> 34:55.760
damaged her.

34:55.843 --> 34:58.679
She was a scared girl,
but I could see her potential.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.349
I was the only surgeon
she allowed to work on her.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.434
I did her implants, her eye lifts,

35:03.518 --> 35:05.353
I even pinned her ears.

35:06.312 --> 35:07.480
I did everything.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.148
Right up until the night
that she died.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.360
Yes, I did operate on her
the night she died.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.862
Little nip and tuck
and finally she'd be perfect.

35:16.322 --> 35:18.574
See, there's that
word again, "perfect."

35:19.283 --> 35:22.203
See, doctor, that word bothers me.
Because it's unattainable

35:22.286 --> 35:24.455
yet every man in Carina's life

35:24.539 --> 35:26.833
seemed to tell her if she just
behave or stay quiet

35:26.916 --> 35:29.627
or did this or that procedure,
she'd have it.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.754
Or at least not get beaten.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.589
I was her surgeon, not her ex-fiance.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.133
Come on, now.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.510
We know that plastic surgeons tend to

35:37.593 --> 35:40.471
exploit the so-called weaknesses
of an insecure woman.

35:40.555 --> 35:43.015
In fact, I think you made it
just as difficult for Carina

35:43.099 --> 35:45.476
to find her way in this world
than Andrew Myers did.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.521
I do a lot of work
for Operation Uplift pro bono.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.274
I rehabilitated
Carina's appearance, yes.

35:51.357 --> 35:55.069
But I also dedicated myself
to rehabbing her mental state.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.738
What you see here is only
the physical part of my work.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.742
You say you pinned her ears back
but there's no scar.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.578
That's incredible.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.288
It's my trademark.

36:05.913 --> 36:08.708
You see that mole by her right ear?

36:09.625 --> 36:11.752
There's an identical one by her left.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.796
To cover the scar tissue.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.967
Impressive. Very--
You mind if I take a picture?

36:18.050 --> 36:21.971
Please. I'm happy to share
my techniques so others may learn.

36:39.822 --> 36:40.907
What?

36:44.243 --> 36:46.162
Hornstock, you mind
checking on something for me?

36:46.287 --> 36:48.372
So you say you worked
on Carina's state of mind.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.625
-How?
-Well, I...

36:51.375 --> 36:53.085
I listened to her,

36:53.169 --> 36:54.962
I helped her unleash
her inner confidence.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.048
Carina had hidden behind
her appearance for so long,

36:57.131 --> 36:58.633
she couldn't find her true self.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.593
Thank you.

37:00.676 --> 37:03.179
So that night, she told me
she was leaving Miami

37:03.262 --> 37:05.306
to pursue a simpler life. Well...

37:05.389 --> 37:06.807
I knew that she was complete.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.310
I had to let her go.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.355
I doubt that.

37:14.774 --> 37:15.650
Why?

37:15.733 --> 37:17.860
Because men like you
are never done playing God.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.365
You're wrong, Doctor.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.116
It's time for me to
get back to the party.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.409
No, no, no.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.203
You can't do that.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.038
Not until you understand.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.089
Excuse me.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.550
Ken.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.511
So glad I found you.

37:44.011 --> 37:47.139
I need your help. We know
Dr. Hawking murdered Carina,

37:47.223 --> 37:49.100
but we can't figure out his motive.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.477
Well, Hawking was obsessed with her.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.730
Can't blame him for being pissed
when Carina fired him.

37:56.065 --> 37:58.109
-Does that help?
-It does.

37:58.192 --> 38:00.194
Yeah, just one thing, though.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.322
How would you know
Carina fired her doctor

38:03.406 --> 38:04.949
unless you saw her after he performed

38:05.032 --> 38:06.993
the liposuction that
allegedly killed her?

38:08.077 --> 38:09.704
Come on, Ken, don't panic.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.956
We have a picture of the real killer.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.291
What, you recognize him?

38:13.624 --> 38:15.084
See, at first I...

38:15.167 --> 38:17.545
I couldn't tell, especially
since you claimed good genes.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.630
But you have Dr. Hawking's signature.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.675
Identical fake moles behind each ear.
Mind if I take a peek?

38:23.217 --> 38:26.595
Modeling in Miami is a tough gig.
I had to keep up appearances.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.931
Here's the thing about
changing your appearance.

38:29.432 --> 38:30.975
You may be beautiful on the outside,

38:31.058 --> 38:33.311
but beneath the surface,

38:34.228 --> 38:35.187
you're a killer.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.606
And that's why I already
called in backup.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.485
Carina and I were supposed to
build the perfect life together.

38:41.902 --> 38:42.737
Away from here.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.239
About that, I just got off
the phone with my colleague,

38:45.323 --> 38:47.742
and it looks like
you did tell the truth.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.660
Carina did wanna leave Miami,

38:49.744 --> 38:52.246
but my colleague also told me
Carina only bought one ticket.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.750
Looks to me like she did want
a fresh start, without you.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.793
So you showed up at her place
to change her mind.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.212
And when she shut you down,
you killed her

39:00.421 --> 39:02.089
and blamed the other two men
in her life.

39:02.381 --> 39:03.424
Just in case.

39:04.258 --> 39:05.134
You can't prove that.

39:06.385 --> 39:08.721
What shade is this?
Sunkiss number four?

39:08.971 --> 39:10.890
See, the trace we found
on Carina's dress

39:10.973 --> 39:12.933
was a shade darker than
her normal foundation.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.602
Because it wasn't her make up.

39:15.770 --> 39:16.729
It was yours.

40:09.281 --> 40:10.449
Please! Don't let me go!

40:12.243 --> 40:13.452
I didn't mean to kill Carina!

40:13.994 --> 40:16.664
She just kept telling me she didn't
love me, and I just lost control.

40:16.997 --> 40:19.250
-Rosie.
-Gimme your other hand.

40:21.335 --> 40:22.169
I can't.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.131
That's because you injured it beating up
Carina's dead body, didn't you?

40:27.425 --> 40:28.884
-All right, you ready?
-Yeah.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.010
This is gonna hurt.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.349
-Don't move!
-Arms behind your back.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.351
Tell me if this sounds on point, Ken.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.479
You took advantage of lidocaine
patches Dr. Hawking left behind.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.314
You already knew
Carina couldn't fight back

40:42.398 --> 40:44.150
because the anesthesia
was already in her system.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.986
You administered the fatal dose,
then you beat up her dead body.

40:47.069 --> 40:50.614
You did all of that so her ex-fiance
would take the fall, but he didn't.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.868
Ken Daltry, you're under arrest
for the murder of Carina Radnor.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.077
Take him out.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.370
Let's go.

41:01.417 --> 41:02.334
You okay, Rosie?

41:03.836 --> 41:04.795
Yeah, I will be.

41:15.389 --> 41:17.683
Autopsy report on Carina Radnor.
Case closed.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.435
-Good job.
-Thanks, man.

41:22.771 --> 41:24.440
-Something wrong, Mitchie?
-No.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.609
Just end of the day, going home.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.945
How about you?
You gonna be going home to...

41:31.071 --> 41:32.156
To Tawnya?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.325
You're not great at digging
for intel, are you, Mitchie?

41:34.408 --> 41:35.784
No, no, I'm not.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.369
No, I'm not going home to Tawnya.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.747
But we talked. We talked about
the fact that there's no correlation

41:39.830 --> 41:41.415
between length of time
in a relationship

41:41.499 --> 41:43.459
and the success of that relationship.

41:43.542 --> 41:45.044
I'm not going home to Tawnya yet.

41:47.379 --> 41:49.423
All right. So where you going?

42:08.776 --> 42:09.693
Checkmate.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.534
Next game?

42:18.202 --> 42:19.245
Sure.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.709
You know, there are 27 bones
in the human hand,

42:26.502 --> 42:27.920
more than any other body part.

42:29.046 --> 42:32.049
If you ever threaten Tawnya again,
I'll have no problem crushing yours.

42:33.717 --> 42:34.552
Who are you?

42:34.635 --> 42:37.388
I'm the man that tells you that
the cycle of abuse stops here.

42:38.472 --> 42:40.599
Otherwise, I'm gonna damage
more than just your hand.

42:45.312 --> 42:46.480
Are you threatening me?

42:46.772 --> 42:48.190
I'm making you a promise.
