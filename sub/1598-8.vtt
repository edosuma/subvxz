I'll tell you this one time
what you missed on Shameless.

Next time, I'm gonna break
both of your fucking kneecaps.

00:13.556 --> 00:15.015
Okay?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.517
Okay. This is what
you fucking missed.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.144
I slept with my ex.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.854
- Since we've been married?
- Yesterday.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.647
- My class schedule
didn't come through.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.315
The registrar said my financial
aid pack was incomplete.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.733
Forms should have been
sent to your house

00:24.733 --> 00:26.110

summer--registered mail.

00:26.110 --> 00:29.321
I just had to take out
a $5,000 cash advance

00:29.321 --> 00:32.032
because nobody told me about
these goddamn fucking papers.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.202
Hi, we're here to
see Ian Gallagher.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.079
This place is already
wigging me the fuck out

00:36.079 --> 00:38.622
There he is.
And look who's here.

00:38.622 --> 00:42.252
- Just the sedation.
- I'm, uh--I'm gonna go.

00:46.256 --> 00:47.798
- Kev and I are separating.
- What?

00:47.798 --> 00:49.592
The only thing he cares
about is the damn babies.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.469
- She's living upstairs.
- You moved out?

00:51.469 --> 00:53.471
No.
Maybe.

00:53.471 --> 00:54.930
I no longer live in

This isn't right.

Oh, no. No.
Oh! Oh.

Frank, if you don't get out
right now,

So let's all make a little
effort to make him feel welcome.

Good thinking.

Skank bitch did it to you.
It'd just be self-defense.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.293
Not after the fact.
And, son, it's important

03:29.293 --> 03:32.171
to know the difference
between a skank bitch

03:32.171 --> 03:34.424
and a deranged psychopath.

03:34.424 --> 03:36.842
Your sister Sammi
is the latter.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.218
So?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.762
So, when you have
a skank bitch

03:39.762 --> 03:41.431
in your house,
you stand up to her.

03:41.431 --> 03:43.974
You push back.
Eventually she leaves.

03:43.974 --> 03:47.270
But with a psychopath, you have
to take a different approach.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.854
But in the end,
she will crawl back

03:48.854 --> 03:52.024

is difficult to hear,

08:35.725 --> 08:37.643
Well, I'm saying that

08:37.643 --> 08:40.395
it will take his meds about two
weeks to really start working.

08:40.395 --> 08:44.983
Until then, yes, I am suggesting
he be carefully supervised.

why you shot him, mama.

Because, Chuckie, fatherhood
comes with responsibilities

that go far beyond shooting
sperm into a "v" hole.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.837
And I have decided it's time
to teach your grandfather

10:27.837 --> 10:29.129
those responsibilities,

because, clearly,
he never learned them.

back to the pound to be gassed,

10:42.768 --> 10:45.312
or train the dog.

to train this dog.

you prefer, daddy?

23:00.547 --> 23:04.175
That's good, dad--
healthy.

23:04.175 --> 23:08.638
But why don't we cover
your ass while we wait, huh?

23:08.638 --> 23:11.516
Hey.

23:11.516 --> 23:13.434
Frequent flier Frank.

23:13.434 --> 23:16.521
- What's that?
- You. Frequent flier Frank.

23:16.521 --> 23:17.939
You're a bit of a legend
around these parts.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.982
Honor to finally meet you.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.318
I sense sarcasm.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.403
I smell infection.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.947
Mm.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.157
Have you been cleaning
this regularly?

23:28.157 --> 23:31.702
I have, but he had
a liver transplant last year

23:31.702 --> 23:33.913
and with the antirejection
meds, his healing process

23:33.913 --> 23:35.457
has been a little wonky.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.584
Got it.
How'd you get shot?

23:37.584 --> 23:41.921
He was cleaning his gun,
and it backfired.

23:41.921 --> 23:45.383
He was cleaning his gun, and
it backfired into his outer arm?

23:45.383 --> 23:47.844
Uh-huh.

23:47.844 --> 23:52.056
You sure about
that story, Frank?

23:52.056 --> 23:54.559
- He is.
- I am.

23:54.559 --> 23:56.686
As a matter of fact,
I'm glad it happened,

23:56.686 --> 23:59.897
because Sammi is such
a good caregiver,

23:59.897 --> 24:01.649
and it affords me
extra time with her.

24:01.649 --> 24:05.194
You see, I missed the first
30-some-odd years of her life,

24:05.194 --> 24:07.572
and I think I can safely say

24:07.572 --> 24:10.950
we both enjoy me being hurt.

24:14.495 --> 24:17.373
Aww.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.041
Daddy.

24:22.712 --> 24:25.339
Mm.

24:27.717 --> 24:30.595

I cook, I clean,

24:43.649 --> 24:46.277
You are landlord.
I am tenant.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.279
Uh, are you kidding?
I'm not gay.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.239
Ah, what is gay?
This is not about love.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.658
This is about
oral manipulation

24:51.658 --> 24:53.535
of sex organs
as stress relief.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.662
No stress is good
for bond with babies.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.664
Tongue is tongue, no?

24:58.664 --> 25:02.418

Hey, there.
Uh, Ian, isn't it?

I remember that 'cause
that's my therapist's name,

26:05.272 --> 26:07.817
and he's a ginger too.
[chuckles]

26:07.817 --> 26:11.570
Anyway, uh, I was wondering
when you think

26:11.570 --> 26:16.325
you might be able to get
to taking down this pool.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.704
Mm, well...

26:19.704 --> 26:23.958
I'm coming down off some
heavy lithium right now...

26:23.958 --> 26:27.796

in an hour or two.

26:27.796 --> 26:30.131

Ian!

26:33.092 --> 26:36.095
Oh, my god,
there you are.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.555
Here I am.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.974
Ian, what happened
to all your pills?

26:39.974 --> 26:41.642
They're gone.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.477
Yeah, I-I can see that
they're gone, but gone where?

26:43.477 --> 26:45.647
Did you swallow them?

26:45.647 --> 26:49.734
No. They're flushed.

26:49.734 --> 26:51.694
Ian, why would you
do that?

26:54.822 --> 26:56.782
They make me
feel awful, Debs,

26:56.782 --> 26:59.702
like life is not
worth living.

26:59.702 --> 27:02.496
I feel so much better
just knowing they're gone.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.044
You know what I find
really moving, Sammi?

27:08.044 --> 27:10.171
The way you love
that boy of yours.

27:10.171 --> 27:12.923
- You messing with me?
- No.

27:12.923 --> 27:16.761
No, my Monica didn't have
much interest in our brood.

27:16.761 --> 27:19.513
Her love was transient
at best--fickle.

27:19.513 --> 27:22.433
Fact is, she left us
high and dry.

27:22.433 --> 27:25.019
But the way you
are with Chuckie,

27:25.019 --> 27:27.688
he's the center of your world,
and you'd never leave him.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.232
I-I find that...

27:30.232 --> 27:32.693
inspiring, sincerely.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.779
Thanks. Dad...
[cell phone ringing]

27:34.779 --> 27:37.114
That means a lot.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.537
Hello?

27:43.537 --> 27:46.040
What?

27:46.040 --> 27:47.249
Wait.

27:47.249 --> 27:51.212
Who--who is?
What?

27:51.212 --> 27:52.839
He was what?

27:52.839 --> 27:55.633
I'd like to make
a concerned citizen report

27:55.633 --> 27:58.803
about a large satchel
filled with hard drugs.

27:58.803 --> 28:02.724
N-n-no, I demand
a lawyer. I--

28:02.724 --> 28:06.227
I demand you stop
questioning him right now!

28:06.227 --> 28:08.855
Wait--wait. I'm coming.
Let me talk to Chuckie!

28:08.855 --> 28:10.147
Put Chuckie on the
god damn phone right now.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.649
There's some sort of
an emergency.

28:14.902 --> 28:17.905
You really think I can
ask him not to go on tour?

28:17.905 --> 28:20.742
- No.
- Then why'd you suggest it?

28:20.742 --> 28:22.993
Because I'm trying to hasten
the end of this thing

28:22.993 --> 28:25.914
you're calling a marriage.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.957
I can't tell if
you're kidding or not.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.751
Yeah.
Neither can I.

28:30.751 --> 28:33.462
- I'm asking for your advice.
- Yeah, I know.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.590
But it's
complicated for me.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.592
Wait. You're the one
that said we couldn't--

28:38.592 --> 28:42.806
Yeah, I know. I'm, um--I'm
just calling a spade a spade.

28:42.806 --> 28:45.683
You need to decide
what you want here.

28:45.683 --> 28:48.102
- With you?
- With your husband. Keep up.

28:48.102 --> 28:49.854
I'm trying.

28:49.854 --> 28:52.231
Okay, walking on eggshells and
sitting around feeling guilty

28:52.231 --> 28:53.774
isn't a decision.
You need to make a decision.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.317
I told him what I did.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.819
I told him I was sorry.
I sent Jimmy away.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.529
What the fuck else
am I supposed to do?

28:58.529 --> 29:01.115
You're scrappy, Fiona.
You know how to fight.

29:01.115 --> 29:03.576
Don't pretend you don't
know how to fight.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.494
- So?
- So either fight

29:05.494 --> 29:06.871
for this marriage
or cut him loose.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.289
Let him lick his wounds
and move on.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.082
You know, this halfway thing
you're doing,

29:10.082 --> 29:13.502
giving him space,
is kind of fucked, right?

29:13.502 --> 29:14.921
If this is a relationship
you want to save,

29:14.921 --> 29:17.047
then you got
to fucking save it.

29:17.047 --> 29:19.801
- Fiona?
- Hey. You okay?

29:19.801 --> 29:21.093
- I'm sorry.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.095
It's all my fault.
I'm so sorry.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.680
What happened?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.016
He flushed his pills.

29:27.016 --> 29:32.730
- 37, 50, 750,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

29:33.982 --> 29:37.861
That's $756.
[clears throat]

29:37.861 --> 29:40.779
Your outstanding bill
is still over $6,000.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.949
I know, and I'll keep
making the payments.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.826
It's unusual for us
to take payments in cash.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.662
Honestly, it's unusual for
us to take payments at all.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.122
Yeah. No, I get that,
and I, uh--

29:50.122 --> 29:51.916
you know, I really,
really appreciate

29:51.916 --> 29:53.709
your patience with me.

Phillip--

29:54.961 --> 29:56.879
It's, uh, lip.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.464
I figure I-I'm gonna
be here a lot.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.592
We might as well
get to know one another.

30:01.592 --> 30:04.971
Lip, have you considered
taking a semester off,

30:04.971 --> 30:06.722
working and saving
your money?

30:06.722 --> 30:07.806
You can come back
next semester

30:07.806 --> 30:09.725
with your financial aid
paperwork intact

30:09.725 --> 30:11.019
and maybe have a little
extra spending money

30:11.019 --> 30:12.311
in your pocket, instead--

30:12.311 --> 30:16.232
I won't make it back.

30:16.232 --> 30:18.984
My, uh...

30:18.984 --> 30:23.239
my little brother Ian
was just diagnosed bipolar.

30:23.239 --> 30:25.616
You know, and--and every
day I'm here, I ju--

30:25.616 --> 30:28.870
I feel so fucking guilty,
you know,

30:28.870 --> 30:31.747
that I'm not there helping.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.044
You know, and the
only reason I-I stay

30:36.044 --> 30:39.463
is, uh...

30:39.463 --> 30:43.717
you know, I can't help.

30:43.717 --> 30:47.055
Yeah, look, 'cause I
spent my whole life,

30:47.055 --> 30:49.473
uh, trying to help my--

30:49.473 --> 30:51.517
my mom, um...

30:51.517 --> 30:55.479
you know,
has the same disease.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.107
And there's no
help for it...

31:00.651 --> 31:02.861
You know, except the--
the little ones, uh, Debbie

31:02.861 --> 31:04.947
and, uh, and--and Carl
and--and Liam

31:04.947 --> 31:06.407
and my sister Fiona.

31:06.407 --> 31:08.534
You know, I-I could be
there for them,

31:08.534 --> 31:11.036
but I'm not...

31:11.036 --> 31:14.581
you know,
'cause I'm here...

31:14.581 --> 31:17.835
'cause I'm told that--that
staying here,

31:17.835 --> 31:19.628
you know, that's--that's
something I could do

31:19.628 --> 31:21.714
for those kids, you know,
in--in a big way.

31:21.714 --> 31:26.051
You know, in--in a real
way, uh, someday.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.512
So I'm here.

31:32.016 --> 31:35.602
But if I go back
to the house...

31:35.602 --> 31:37.187
well, then I'm in it,

31:37.187 --> 31:40.524
you know, and--and I can't
get back out of it.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.029
You know, so I'm--I'm
gonna keep coming here,

31:45.029 --> 31:48.115
and I'm--I'm gonna keep, uh,
making these payments.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.076
I'm gonna--I'm gonna show up,
and I'm gonna count 'em out,

31:50.076 --> 31:51.493
and then, you know,
that'll be my part.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.580
And your part,
I hope, is, um...

31:56.123 --> 31:58.125
patience.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.796
Please, you know,
I just...

32:04.840 --> 32:07.135
Fuck, I just need
a little time.

32:12.015 --> 32:15.100
One more week
is all I can do.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.645
You need a prescription
for a refill.

32:18.645 --> 32:21.148
I understand that that's
officially true.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.150
But you know that these
prescriptions are only written

32:23.150 --> 32:24.777
for people who do
crazy shit,

32:24.777 --> 32:26.362
like flush their meds
down the toilet

32:26.362 --> 32:27.905
'cause they don't want
to take them,

32:27.905 --> 32:29.740
so maybe you can just
refill them

32:29.740 --> 32:30.949
'cause you know
it's the right thing to do

32:30.949 --> 32:33.995
instead of giving us
the official line.

32:33.995 --> 32:37.122
Officially, I will go
to jail if I do that.

32:37.122 --> 32:41.460
Get a prescription,
and you can have a refill.

32:41.460 --> 32:45.339
Come on.
Come on.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.512
When did you fall
in love with yours?

32:51.512 --> 32:54.515
There was no falling,
just being.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.184
He comes out,
they hand him to me,

32:56.184 --> 32:57.351
everything changes.

32:57.351 --> 32:59.603
Before Yevgeny,
I was selfish.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.980
Now I would die
before I let him die.

33:01.980 --> 33:06.110
It's simple, complete.

33:06.110 --> 33:08.320
I never made that change.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.155
Kev did.
I didn't.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.366
Some do, some don't.

33:12.366 --> 33:16.162
I hate him for changing,
and he hates me for not.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.914
Because you Americans like
everything to be right or wrong.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.582
If someone is like you,
it is right.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.876
If someone is not,
it is wrong.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.503
But this is not real.

33:24.503 --> 33:28.216
Life is not so this or that,
black and white.

33:28.216 --> 33:31.093
No, you should be happy your
Kev makes these changes,

33:31.093 --> 33:34.805
because if no one does, this is
how babies end up in dumpsters.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.436
I don't give a shit
about Chuckie,

33:40.436 --> 33:42.188
but I'm pretty sure
G-Dogg's gonna kill me.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.148
No, he won't.
There's nothing to be gained

33:44.148 --> 33:47.401
by killing a perfectly
good corner boy.

33:47.401 --> 33:50.446
And it's not your fault that
they came with drug dogs.

33:50.446 --> 33:53.407
That's the luck of the draw.
G-Dogg will understand that.

33:53.407 --> 33:55.993
You really think so?

33:55.993 --> 33:58.036
I'm almost certain.
