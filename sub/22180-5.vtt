00:01.323 --> 00:03.463
Previously on <i>Madam Secretary</i>...

00:03.464 --> 00:04.785
You're going to need a Chief of staff.

00:04.786 --> 00:06.929
Okay. Then I'd be honored
to be considered.

00:06.930 --> 00:09.432
There's no consideration.
You are it, pal.

00:09.433 --> 00:12.337
There will be a partial shutdown
of the federal government

00:12.338 --> 00:13.839
in a matter of days.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.441
You're playing a more
dangerous game than you know.

00:16.442 --> 00:18.577
You played a pretty
dangerous game yourself.

00:18.578 --> 00:20.746
I am not letting that puny ideologue

00:20.747 --> 00:22.781
dismantle Conrad's
agenda piece by piece

00:22.782 --> 00:24.216
over the next four years!

00:24.217 --> 00:26.285
ELIZABETH:
<i>I wanted you to meet a mother</i>

00:26.286 --> 00:28.253
whose daughter was taken
by the criminals

00:28.254 --> 00:30.088
we're trying to stop.

00:30.089 --> 00:31.590
The Russians are stepping
up their efforts

00:31.591 --> 00:32.925
to bolster the Taliban

00:32.926 --> 00:36.461
and undermine the democratic
government in Afghanistan.

00:36.462 --> 00:38.563
I don't have to tell
you how disastrous

00:38.564 --> 00:40.232
that would be to the United States...

00:40.233 --> 00:42.501
well, the entire Western world...

00:42.502 --> 00:44.602
if they were to succeed.

00:45.437 --> 00:47.839
HENRY: <i>Russian support for the Taliban</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:49.508
<i>is growing in intensity.</i> _

00:49.509 --> 00:51.109
<i>According to our source,</i>

00:51.110 --> 00:53.645
this latest transfer included
lethal weaponry,

00:53.646 --> 00:56.648
including RPG-7s,
PKs and Kord machine guns,

00:56.649 --> 00:59.885
which were used in an attack
on an Afghan police station

00:59.886 --> 01:02.154
in Mazar-i-Sharif last night,

01:02.155 --> 01:04.556
leaving 23 dead.

01:04.557 --> 01:06.525
CARPENTER: Terrible business.

01:06.526 --> 01:08.226
I've read the reports.

01:08.227 --> 01:11.697
But, well, why do you think
the Kremlin is arming

01:11.698 --> 01:13.565
- the Taliban?
- Well, one, because it undermines

01:13.566 --> 01:15.167
American interests in the region.

01:15.168 --> 01:18.804
And two, because it
establishes a relationship

01:18.805 --> 01:20.739
in the event the Afghan
government falls.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.341
And you think that's likely?

01:22.342 --> 01:24.309
If the infiltration continues, yes.

01:24.310 --> 01:26.478
That's why Special Activities
Division is requesting

01:26.479 --> 01:29.214
emergency funding,
so that we can hire personnel,

01:29.215 --> 01:30.782
develop sources,

01:30.783 --> 01:32.084
and launch new operations

01:32.085 --> 01:33.982
against Russian targets in Kabul.

01:33.983 --> 01:35.454
So you're trying to nip
this thing in the bud

01:35.455 --> 01:37.656
- before GRU gets a foothold.
- Yeah, exactly.

01:37.657 --> 01:39.124
Then I'm inclined

01:39.125 --> 01:41.026
to support your request.

01:41.027 --> 01:42.961
We must defend our allies

01:42.962 --> 01:44.629
in Kabul.

01:44.630 --> 01:46.631
With all due respect
to the majority leader,

01:46.632 --> 01:49.301
I am not ready to sign
a blank check here.

01:49.302 --> 01:52.637
Our Afghan partners
are divided and weak

01:52.638 --> 01:55.807
because so-called best efforts
of the Dalton administration

01:55.808 --> 01:57.175
have failed.

01:57.176 --> 02:00.545
I'm afraid I didn't hear a
question in there, Senator.

02:00.546 --> 02:04.116
Well, isn't this Russia thing
just an attempt by the president

02:04.117 --> 02:05.650
to deny blame for a failed policy?

02:05.651 --> 02:08.487
I assure you, the threat is real.

02:08.488 --> 02:11.056
Well, maybe the fault lies
with the secretary of state.

02:11.056 --> 02:13.358
She's the one that executes

02:13.359 --> 02:14.992
that policy.

02:16.395 --> 02:18.697
I'm more interested in
finding solutions

02:18.698 --> 02:20.232
than assigning blame,

02:20.233 --> 02:23.135
but the secretary can only do
so much with the budget

02:23.136 --> 02:24.636
approved by this Congress.

02:24.637 --> 02:25.871
Senator Morejon,

02:25.872 --> 02:29.908
you ran your campaign on a
platform of national security.

02:29.909 --> 02:32.944
So I'm asking, respectfully,

02:32.945 --> 02:35.380
for you to put your money
where your mouth is.

02:35.381 --> 02:38.183
ELIZABETH: <i>"Put your money
where your mouth is"?</i>

02:38.184 --> 02:40.719
You actually said that?

02:40.720 --> 02:42.020
Guy went after my wife.

02:42.021 --> 02:44.056
So you went full <i>Godfather.</i>

02:44.057 --> 02:46.024
Yeah, and I got my funding.

02:46.025 --> 02:48.427
I guess I made him a request
he couldn't refuse.

02:48.428 --> 02:49.728
Yeah, a smart one.

02:49.729 --> 02:51.096
Oh, hey, listen,

02:51.097 --> 02:53.231
while you're on the Hill,
will you stop by Colonial Gelato

02:53.232 --> 02:54.833
and get some pistachio for Ali?

02:54.834 --> 02:56.601
She texted me she's gonna
come over tonight.

02:56.602 --> 02:57.636
Again?

02:57.637 --> 02:58.804
She was just there.

02:58.805 --> 03:00.863
I mean, is it normal for
a freshman in college

03:00.864 --> 03:02.311
to want to spend so much time at home?

03:02.312 --> 03:05.110
No, stop.
I like it when she comes home.

03:05.111 --> 03:07.179
And she's not an
intelligence asset, Henry.

03:07.180 --> 03:09.915
You don't have to
question her motives.

03:09.916 --> 03:11.016
She's my daughter.

03:11.017 --> 03:13.018
I question everything.
(Elizabeth chuckles)

03:13.019 --> 03:16.822
Two tubs of pistachio, Don Corleone.

03:16.823 --> 03:17.823
(elevator bell dings)

03:17.824 --> 03:19.357
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

03:19.358 --> 03:20.459
- Morning.
- Hey!

03:20.460 --> 03:21.960
- Oh, here.
- Oh.

03:21.961 --> 03:24.529
- Matt, welcome back.
- Thank you so much.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.364
It's great to be here,
with consequential work

03:26.365 --> 03:28.100
and fresh pastries.

03:28.101 --> 03:29.167
There's fresh pastries?

03:29.168 --> 03:30.735
- No.
- Yeah.

03:30.736 --> 03:31.937
Morning, Madam Secretary.

03:31.938 --> 03:34.072
Good morning, Mr. Chief of Staff.

03:34.073 --> 03:36.441
How's your first major
initiative going?

03:36.442 --> 03:38.543
Finally got the Summit team assembled.

03:38.544 --> 03:40.204
They're waiting
in the portrait gallery.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.124
- Okay. - He's been herding
the G/TIP Program Officers

03:42.125 --> 03:43.081
since 5:00 this morning.

03:43.082 --> 03:44.182
Happy to be sleep deprived

03:44.183 --> 03:45.951
for a landmark deal
on human trafficking.

03:45.952 --> 03:47.619
(chuckles)

03:47.620 --> 03:48.820
Oh, hey, wait.

03:48.821 --> 03:50.489
Has anyone heard from Daisy?
What's the news?

03:50.490 --> 03:52.691
Oh, she's great. She's binge-watching

03:52.692 --> 03:54.526
<i>Real Housewives,</i> about ready to pop.

03:54.527 --> 03:56.795
Oh, tell her to skip <i>Potomac,</i>
it's the worst one.

03:56.796 --> 03:57.996
I... I heard.

03:57.997 --> 03:59.664
- Tell her to hang in there.
- I will.

03:59.665 --> 04:00.732
Diane.

04:00.733 --> 04:03.168
It's good to see you.

04:03.169 --> 04:05.736
Proud to serve, Madam Secretary.

04:07.506 --> 04:09.774
Uh, good morning.

04:09.775 --> 04:11.309
ALL: Good morning.

04:11.310 --> 04:14.746
To those of you who were
on furlough: welcome back.

04:14.747 --> 04:17.382
And there are fresh
pastries on Uncle Sam.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.317
- In that room.
- (scattered laughter)

04:19.317 --> 04:21.720
Um, I-I just wanted to acknowledge

04:21.721 --> 04:24.089
the incredible work you have done

04:24.090 --> 04:26.324
to prepare for this
Human Trafficking Summit

04:26.325 --> 04:27.459
in Kyrgyzstan.

04:27.460 --> 04:31.329
Central Asia is still one
of the last strongholds

04:31.330 --> 04:33.865
of forced labor and
sexual exploitation.

04:33.866 --> 04:37.335
Thanks to you, we now
have a framework agreement

04:37.336 --> 04:40.605
which includes advanced
prevention efforts

04:40.606 --> 04:44.042
and reparations to the
victims and their families.

04:44.043 --> 04:47.812
Which means justice
for people like Diane Cramer,

04:47.813 --> 04:50.715
who, despite losing her daughter Lara,

04:50.716 --> 04:54.386
is personally serving on
our negotiations team.

04:54.387 --> 04:55.654
On that note,

04:55.655 --> 04:59.925
I will turn it over
to my new chief of staff,

04:59.926 --> 05:01.593
- Jay Whitman.
- Okay.

05:01.594 --> 05:04.496
(applause)

05:04.497 --> 05:06.998
Copies of my latest draft agreement

05:06.999 --> 05:09.568
will be arriving in your
inboxes any minute.

05:09.569 --> 05:12.070
There'll be a travel briefing
at 11:00 in Conference Room F

05:12.071 --> 05:15.040
where there will be
even more pastries.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.474
- (all laugh)
- Thank you.

05:16.475 --> 05:17.775
(applause)

05:25.317 --> 05:26.418
(knocks)

05:26.419 --> 05:28.253
Hey.

05:28.254 --> 05:29.588
Look who's back.

05:29.589 --> 05:32.457
And he brought a blankie.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.125
Are we really so scary?

05:34.126 --> 05:36.061
I, uh, I made this for Molly.

05:36.062 --> 05:37.429
She's on bed rest.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.397
Looks like the kiddo's coming early.

05:39.398 --> 05:41.332
But I'll see that she gets it.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.037
You seriously, you knit this?

05:46.038 --> 05:48.039
Had way too much time on
my hands during the furlough.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.941
Morning, Team.

05:49.942 --> 05:52.310
Meet Agent Nafisa Samadi.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.679
She's our Chief of Station in Kabul.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.780
Dylan Larsen.

05:55.781 --> 05:57.716
- Hi.
- Alexander Mehranov.

05:57.717 --> 05:58.717
Hi there.

05:58.718 --> 06:00.373
HENRY: Nafisa's in D.C. to coordinate

06:00.374 --> 06:03.455
strategy on our intelligence
operations in Afghanistan.

06:03.456 --> 06:05.624
Which so far have been
focused on our primary asset,

06:05.625 --> 06:06.992
Osip Bakunin.

06:06.993 --> 06:09.572
HENRY: But now that Congress
has loosened the purse strings,

06:09.573 --> 06:11.363
I want to expand our options.

06:11.364 --> 06:13.865
So, where are we
on Andrei Yarmolinsky?

06:13.866 --> 06:15.634
Well, everything continues to point

06:15.635 --> 06:18.303
to him being the principal
GRU agent operating in Kabul.

06:18.304 --> 06:20.405
But we have no idea
who he's working with.

06:20.406 --> 06:22.340
Well, if we're really serious

06:22.341 --> 06:24.643
about deterring Russian
aggression in Afghanistan,

06:24.644 --> 06:26.144
we need to uncover his network.

06:26.145 --> 06:28.780
Which means ramping up
our staff in-country.

06:28.781 --> 06:31.549
Nafisa, how quickly can we
set up a safe house,

06:31.550 --> 06:34.953
increase our surveillance
operations in Kabul?

06:34.954 --> 06:37.222
24 hours to select the personnel,

06:37.223 --> 06:38.990
another 24 to set up the site.

06:38.991 --> 06:40.392
Okay, let's get started.

06:40.393 --> 06:42.360
That's it.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.762
Uh, Alexander, hang back
for a second, would you?

06:49.367 --> 06:50.869
How you doing?

06:50.870 --> 06:53.004
Um...

06:53.005 --> 06:55.807
my rehab counselor says
that I should try knitting.

06:55.808 --> 06:57.208
You know, focuses the mind.

06:57.209 --> 07:01.046
And, uh, now all I can do is
have dreams about cable stitch.

07:01.047 --> 07:04.448
Well, it's an effective therapy.
Keep it up.

07:05.950 --> 07:07.619
Is there something else?

07:07.620 --> 07:08.820
No.

07:08.821 --> 07:11.321
Just wanted to say
I'm glad to have you back.

07:15.627 --> 07:17.395
(door closes)

07:17.396 --> 07:20.765
President Nogoyev will
be right in the middle

07:20.766 --> 07:22.100
of the table, here.

07:22.101 --> 07:23.635
Mrs. Cramer, you'll be
seated over here.

07:23.636 --> 07:25.570
Directly across from him.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.205
Are you sure that's best?

07:27.206 --> 07:30.141
Well, if he tries to
backtrack on reparations,

07:30.142 --> 07:33.445
he'll have to do it to your face. Huh.

07:33.446 --> 07:37.549
That is, uh, if you're
up for it, of course.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.551
Madam Secretary,

07:39.552 --> 07:42.687
when Lara died in that truck, I...

07:42.688 --> 07:45.323
(sighs)

07:45.324 --> 07:48.126
When you offered me the chance

07:48.127 --> 07:51.663
to work on behalf of her
and all the victims,

07:51.664 --> 07:54.866
it gave me my life back, so,

07:54.867 --> 07:57.135
yes, I'm up for anything

07:57.136 --> 08:00.237
that will help get this deal done.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.275
Thank you.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.912
The secretary will be
next to you on your left,

08:07.913 --> 08:10.014
and seated to your right
will be Julia MacDonald,

08:10.015 --> 08:11.349
our ambassador to Kyrgyzstan.

08:11.350 --> 08:13.685
ELIZABETH: She personally
hammered out the agreement

08:13.686 --> 08:15.420
on local police cooperation.

08:15.421 --> 08:17.088
She's relentless.

08:17.089 --> 08:19.557
Well, she's also a former
Olympic athlete.

08:19.558 --> 08:21.226
She took medal at steeplechase.

08:21.227 --> 08:22.394
Speaking of, ma'am,

08:22.395 --> 08:23.928
I have Ambassador MacDonald on SVTC.

08:23.929 --> 08:26.597
Ah. This'll just be a second.
Thank you.

08:28.266 --> 08:30.268
ELIZABETH: <i>Julia...</i>

08:30.269 --> 08:31.870
I have a bone to pick with you.

08:31.871 --> 08:33.938
Really, Madam Secretary?

08:33.938 --> 08:36.073
What's this Olympic medal
you never told me about?

08:36.075 --> 08:39.544
(scoffs) It was only a bronze.

08:39.544 --> 08:43.047
And, honestly, the hurdles I'm
currently facing are far worse.

08:43.048 --> 08:44.949
All right, what's the trouble?

08:44.950 --> 08:47.018
I have been getting the cold shoulder

08:47.019 --> 08:48.920
from President Nogoyev
since yesterday.

08:48.921 --> 08:52.357
Then this morning, he
cancels all press visas

08:52.358 --> 08:54.659
and ceases data sharing with Interpol.

08:54.660 --> 08:58.263
Sounds like the cold shoulder is
attached to a pair of cold feet.

08:58.264 --> 08:59.631
JAY: You think he's
having second thoughts

08:59.632 --> 09:00.965
about paying reparations?

09:00.966 --> 09:04.135
Well, he was a hard sell on
the Summit from the beginning.

09:04.136 --> 09:05.403
We finally pinned him down

09:05.404 --> 09:06.771
on the framework agreement,

09:06.772 --> 09:08.973
but he was clearly unhappy
with the outcome.

09:08.974 --> 09:12.110
So now he's posturing
for a better deal.

09:12.111 --> 09:14.345
Or avoiding one altogether.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.847
Either way, I'd say our
mission is in trouble.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.784
Thank you, Julia.

09:19.785 --> 09:21.019
Keep me posted.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.320
Will do, ma'am.

09:25.924 --> 09:28.493
Okay, I'll say it for argument's sake.

09:28.494 --> 09:31.963
Should we offer Nogoyev
some kind of inducement?

09:31.964 --> 09:33.031
No way.

09:33.032 --> 09:34.958
We fought tooth and nail
for every provision

09:34.959 --> 09:36.494
in this framework.
If this is a shakedown,

09:36.495 --> 09:39.137
I don't want to make any
preemptive concessions.

09:39.138 --> 09:40.405
Ma'am.

09:40.406 --> 09:43.341
Neither do I.

09:43.342 --> 09:47.378
Which leaves only one good option.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.814
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I know it's short notice.

09:49.815 --> 09:51.815
Short notice is a same day appointment

09:51.816 --> 09:53.248
with my cardiologist.

09:53.249 --> 09:54.953
Not an international trip
for a president

09:54.954 --> 09:56.955
burdened with the aftershocks
of a government shutdown.

09:56.956 --> 09:58.656
It's only for a couple of days.

09:58.657 --> 10:00.525
Yeah, well, that's cute,
but we're already weeks behind

10:00.526 --> 10:02.827
on our "Pave America" campaign

10:02.828 --> 10:05.129
to repair our nation's
decrepit infrastructure.

10:05.130 --> 10:07.198
As far as I'm concerned,
you can get on board

10:07.199 --> 10:08.566
- or get out of the way.
- With respect,

10:08.567 --> 10:10.867
Mr. Jackson, that isn't your call.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.872
Is he gonna be talking to me that way?

10:13.873 --> 10:16.406
Get on board.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.412
DALTON: <i>You want me to fly</i>

10:21.413 --> 10:23.248
- to Kyrgyzstan.
- Yes, sir.

10:23.249 --> 10:27.552
An egomaniac like Nogoyev
is vulnerable to flattery.

10:27.553 --> 10:29.020
And there's nothing more flattering

10:29.021 --> 10:30.822
than a visit from the
President of the United States.

10:30.823 --> 10:34.227
This man is supposed to be
giving a speech on a bridge

10:34.228 --> 10:36.794
over the Ohio River
tomorrow afternoon.

10:36.795 --> 10:39.364
You want him to go to a
country whose biggest exports

10:39.365 --> 10:41.332
are wool and yak cheese?

10:41.333 --> 10:42.834
Gold and cotton, actually.

10:42.835 --> 10:44.102
I don't care!

10:44.103 --> 10:45.436
And neither do the actual voters

10:45.437 --> 10:47.005
who are sick of
crashing into potholes.

10:47.006 --> 10:50.275
Sir, you know how our
enemies will spin this.

10:50.276 --> 10:52.477
They'll say we're
ignoring crime at home.

10:52.478 --> 10:53.945
Crime doesn't respect borders.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.313
That's why Diane Cramer's
20-year-old daughter

10:55.314 --> 10:56.881
suffocated in the back
of a delivery truck,

10:56.882 --> 10:58.683
6,000 miles from home.

10:58.684 --> 11:00.318
Fair enough,

11:00.319 --> 11:04.389
but the president can only be
in so many places at once.

11:04.390 --> 11:05.657
ELIZABETH: True.

11:05.658 --> 11:09.494
But this is an exceptional
opportunity.

11:09.495 --> 11:12.564
We have a chance to strike a
blow against human trafficking

11:12.565 --> 11:16.000
that will last generations.

11:16.001 --> 11:17.968
Come with us, sir.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.641
Clear my schedule, Russell.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.144
We're going to the land
of gold and cotton.

11:26.145 --> 11:27.712
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

11:27.713 --> 11:29.380
REPORTER: <i>Senator,
the president has called for</i>

11:29.381 --> 11:31.115
<i>a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan.</i>

11:31.116 --> 11:33.351
Are you willing
to work with him on that?

11:33.352 --> 11:35.787
Would you trust the man
who cancels a trip to Ohio

11:35.788 --> 11:38.723
to stump for one of Elizabeth
McCord's pet projects

11:38.724 --> 11:40.191
in Kyrgyzstan?

11:40.192 --> 11:44.028
It's a hollow promise when
the globalist rot runs deep.

11:44.029 --> 11:45.296
- (reporters clamor)
- (TV clicks off)

11:45.297 --> 11:46.598
HENRY: That guy... I mean...

11:46.599 --> 11:49.334
I need another scoop.

11:49.335 --> 11:52.437
I mean, who knew that
trying to end human slavery

11:52.438 --> 11:53.974
- would be so controversial?
- Have more.

11:53.975 --> 11:55.607
- I definitely want more. (gasps)
- Hello!

11:55.608 --> 11:57.442
- Hey!
- Oh! - Hey.

11:57.443 --> 11:58.876
Our fashionista!

11:58.877 --> 12:02.046
What can I say? I'm a sucker for
free food and fabric softener.

12:02.047 --> 12:03.247
Yeah, and-and room

12:03.248 --> 12:05.416
- to spread out, I understand.
- Oh, yeah.

12:05.417 --> 12:08.653
Lucinda's converted our room
into a theater for sock puppets.

12:08.654 --> 12:10.221
- (chuckles): Oh, God.
- Ooh, pistachio?

12:10.222 --> 12:11.677
- Yeah!
- Have some.

12:11.678 --> 12:13.091
How's your midterm coming along?

12:13.092 --> 12:14.993
My dress? It's going okay.

12:14.994 --> 12:17.528
Ooh, <i>Vampire Nerds</i> is on demand...

12:17.529 --> 12:19.230
- you guys in?
- That pretty much slays my demo.

12:19.231 --> 12:21.332
- You know I'm down.
- I'm down.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.067
You sure you have time, Noodle?

12:23.068 --> 12:25.169
Yeah. Right now I need
to turn off my brain

12:25.170 --> 12:26.871
- and watch teenagers bite each other.
- (laughs)

12:26.872 --> 12:28.773
Please. All she has to do is
pull down a shower curtain

12:28.774 --> 12:30.074
and cut out some arm holes.

12:30.075 --> 12:31.676
- Oh, would you just... (exclaims)
- What? - Not necessary.

12:31.677 --> 12:33.311
- (phone rings) - It's called
upcycling... it's all the rage

12:33.312 --> 12:34.812
- right now. - Come on.
- I've been home for five minutes.

12:34.813 --> 12:36.314
Let's-let's walk... Come on.

12:36.315 --> 12:38.583
No, no, no, no, no,
you have to watch this one.

12:38.584 --> 12:39.717
Mom?

12:39.718 --> 12:41.252
- You have to watch this one, Dad.
- Hmm?

12:41.253 --> 12:42.820
Uh, Ambassador MacDonald for you.

12:42.821 --> 12:45.456
Oh.

12:45.457 --> 12:46.791
Thank you.

12:46.792 --> 12:49.260
Julia?

12:49.261 --> 12:50.528
You psyched to meet POTUS?

12:50.529 --> 12:52.230
Uh, I'm afraid not, ma'am.

12:52.231 --> 12:53.906
What's happening? Are you okay?

12:53.907 --> 12:55.833
I'm being expelled from the country.
I've been declared

12:55.834 --> 12:57.168
persona non grata.

12:57.169 --> 12:59.070
No, they can't do that.
On what grounds?

12:59.071 --> 13:00.371
They haven't said, ma'am.

13:00.372 --> 13:02.907
They-they forced their
way into the residence.

13:02.908 --> 13:05.109
Oh, my God. Did they hurt you?
I mean, are you...

13:05.110 --> 13:07.378
I'm gonna call POTUS,
have him issue a démarche. _

13:07.379 --> 13:09.180
- They can't do this.
- Hey! _

13:09.181 --> 13:10.515
No, you can't do that! _

13:10.516 --> 13:13.450
Julia? Julia.

13:13.741 --> 13:20.928
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

13:24.457 --> 13:26.926
Thanks, buddy. Hang in there.

13:26.927 --> 13:30.917
That was Jay. Julia MacDonald's
on her way over here,

13:30.918 --> 13:32.285
should be here any minute.

13:32.286 --> 13:35.321
What'd the Kyrgyz say?

13:35.322 --> 13:36.856
Radio silence.

13:36.857 --> 13:39.158
And the Summit is in limbo

13:39.159 --> 13:40.927
until we're back on speaking terms.

13:40.928 --> 13:42.829
You'd think they'd offer
some kind of explanation.

13:42.830 --> 13:44.330
Normally, they wouldn't have to.

13:44.331 --> 13:48.100
Persona non grata is a
response to something noisy,

13:48.101 --> 13:50.403
like declaring war

13:50.404 --> 13:52.338
or committing murder.

13:52.339 --> 13:54.841
While we're on ominous developments...

13:54.842 --> 13:57.276
I just checked the
radiator in Alison's room.

13:57.277 --> 13:59.679
Radiator's fine.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.381
I just wanted to see how she was
doing on her design project

14:02.382 --> 14:05.117
- while she's out to breakfast
with Stevie. - (laughs)

14:05.118 --> 14:07.253
You spied on our daughter.

14:07.254 --> 14:10.022
As far as I can tell,
she hasn't even started yet.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.157
What?

14:11.158 --> 14:12.959
Yeah, there's a whole
lot of materials,

14:12.960 --> 14:15.595
but no sign of construction.

14:15.596 --> 14:19.499
She watched the entire <i>Vampire
Nerds</i> trilogy last night,

14:19.500 --> 14:21.234
including <i>Revenge of the Were-Jocks.</i>

14:21.235 --> 14:23.069
(doorbell rings)

14:23.070 --> 14:24.704
We don't have to worry
about an empty nest.

14:24.705 --> 14:27.507
If Ali fails her midterm,
next thing we know,

14:27.508 --> 14:30.109
she'll be 40, still living at home

14:30.110 --> 14:33.244
and driving us to colonoscopies.

14:34.647 --> 14:36.115
I'll talk to her.

14:36.116 --> 14:37.582
Thank you.

14:40.453 --> 14:43.656
Julia, hi. Come on in.

14:43.657 --> 14:45.224
Oh, this is my husband Henry.

14:45.225 --> 14:46.359
Hi. It's a pleasure.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.461
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'll leave you guys.

14:48.462 --> 14:50.029
Can I get you something to drink?

14:50.030 --> 14:51.030
No, thank you.

14:51.031 --> 14:54.033
Okay. Uh, come, sit, please.

14:54.034 --> 14:55.601
Uh, how was your flight?

14:55.602 --> 14:56.636
(both chuckle)

14:56.637 --> 14:58.037
I've had better.

14:58.038 --> 15:01.140
Listen, I-I know that you've
been through hell, but I...

15:01.141 --> 15:03.209
I need to know what
I'm dealing with here.

15:03.210 --> 15:05.111
Do you have any idea
why you were expelled?

15:05.112 --> 15:08.414
It's much simpler
if I offer my resignation.

15:08.415 --> 15:10.449
No. Not a chance.

15:10.450 --> 15:11.684
But the Human Trafficking Summit...

15:11.685 --> 15:14.520
I'm not gonna let Nogoyev
abuse my diplomats.

15:14.521 --> 15:15.688
It's humiliating.

15:15.689 --> 15:17.990
And he is cruel and arbitrary.

15:17.991 --> 15:20.259
It isn't arbitrary, ma'am.

15:20.260 --> 15:24.931
I, uh, I was... I was
involved with Feliks Karimov,

15:24.932 --> 15:27.500
the Minister of Health and
the president's brother-in-law.

15:27.501 --> 15:29.001
What?!

15:29.002 --> 15:31.003
He runs a series of clinics
for indigent children.

15:31.004 --> 15:32.305
Oh, my God.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.607
At the time, the-the embassy

15:34.608 --> 15:36.709
was involved with
health care diplomacy.

15:36.710 --> 15:38.844
One thing led to another, and...

15:38.845 --> 15:41.013
Nogoyev must have found out.

15:41.014 --> 15:42.048
(sighs)

15:42.049 --> 15:44.383
I know it sounds crazy,
but we had plans.

15:44.384 --> 15:45.585
It made sense.

15:45.586 --> 15:48.120
Yeah, this is the part
that I am struggling with.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.889
How did you allow it to make sense?

15:49.890 --> 15:51.924
Feliks isn't like his brother-in-law.

15:51.925 --> 15:53.693
He's-he's patient, funny.

15:53.694 --> 15:56.896
Oh, Julia, this is,
this is bigger than you.

15:56.897 --> 15:58.998
I mean... (sighs)

15:58.999 --> 16:01.701
We got here on the backs
of decades of women

16:01.702 --> 16:04.937
who worked their whole lives to
be trusted and taken seriously

16:04.938 --> 16:06.672
and you just...

16:06.673 --> 16:08.540
(sighs)

16:10.176 --> 16:13.079
Our mistakes are magnified.
It's not fair.

16:13.080 --> 16:18.117
We owe it to each other
to remember that.

16:18.118 --> 16:19.885
I know.

16:19.886 --> 16:21.586
And it sickens me.

16:24.256 --> 16:26.558
I'll take that letter now.

16:34.767 --> 16:36.802
Can I make one request?

16:36.803 --> 16:40.172
I haven't heard from Feliks,
and given Nogoyev's reputation,

16:40.173 --> 16:41.974
I'm worried for his safety.

16:41.975 --> 16:43.908
Can you check on him, please?

16:46.012 --> 16:48.014
I'll see what I can do.

16:48.015 --> 16:50.281
Thank you, ma'am.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.074

16:59.458 --> 17:02.061
RUSSELL: I can't
decide which is worse,

17:02.062 --> 17:04.430
sleeping with a foreign
president's brother-in-law

17:04.431 --> 17:07.151
or being dumb enough to get caught.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.834
She's in love, Russell.
It's a human mistake.

17:08.835 --> 17:11.503
It's a stain on this
whole administration.

17:11.505 --> 17:13.271
What's our response?

17:13.272 --> 17:16.776
Julia confessed right away.
We have a chance

17:16.777 --> 17:18.477
- to clean it up.
- RUSSELL: (scoffs) Oh, yeah?

17:18.478 --> 17:19.645
If Morejon finds out

17:19.646 --> 17:20.980
about this little affair,

17:20.981 --> 17:24.215
he'll roast us over the flaming
hot coals of cable news.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.984
We can kiss our
infrastructure deal good-bye.

17:25.986 --> 17:28.854
Here's the thing, I don't think
he will find out about it.

17:28.855 --> 17:30.356
Kyrgyzstan hasn't
released it to the media.

17:30.357 --> 17:31.524
There's a reason for that.

17:31.525 --> 17:34.860
Nogoyev is incredibly
protective of his family.

17:34.861 --> 17:37.797
He doesn't want his dirty
laundry out in public

17:37.798 --> 17:40.066
- any more than we do.
- It's the diplomatic equivalent

17:40.067 --> 17:42.500
of mutually assured destruction.

17:43.803 --> 17:45.471
Pro tip:

17:45.472 --> 17:46.939
when you're trying to reassure,

17:46.940 --> 17:49.974
don't use a metaphor
for nuclear holocaust.

17:50.876 --> 17:53.913
We can put out a statement
that Julia resigned

17:53.914 --> 17:55.481
for personal reasons.

17:55.482 --> 17:58.050
Yep, then make a side
deal with Nogoyev

17:58.051 --> 18:01.087
to have the Summit
go ahead as scheduled.

18:01.088 --> 18:02.354
All right.

18:02.355 --> 18:05.391
Bess, you can explore
rapprochement with Kyrgyzstan,

18:05.392 --> 18:06.959
especially if it means
saving the Summit,

18:06.960 --> 18:09.061
but, uh, you'll have
to do it without me.

18:09.062 --> 18:11.497
Yes, sir.

18:11.498 --> 18:14.799
Politics are too radioactive,
so to speak.

18:15.801 --> 18:18.738
Russell, put the bridge back
on the original schedule.

18:18.739 --> 18:20.238
Pleasure, Mr. President.

18:22.975 --> 18:24.910
Hey.

18:24.911 --> 18:26.212
Hey, Noodle.

18:26.213 --> 18:27.513
How was breakfast?

18:27.514 --> 18:28.481
Good.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.349
I thought you'd be at work.

18:30.350 --> 18:33.919
I thought you'd be spending more
time on your midterm project.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.755
(clears throat)

18:35.756 --> 18:40.025
Look, your mom and I know that
you haven't started your dress.

18:40.026 --> 18:41.727
You were in my room?

18:41.728 --> 18:43.362
Technically our room.

18:43.363 --> 18:44.497
And house.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.831
And come to think of it, we're paying

18:45.832 --> 18:47.633
- for your tuition, too, so...
- That does not make it okay.

18:47.634 --> 18:50.436
Uh, okay, fair enough. Look...

18:50.437 --> 18:52.904
I just want to make sure you're okay.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.743
I don't know what I was
thinking with this design class.

18:57.744 --> 18:59.712
What are you talking about?

18:59.713 --> 19:03.015
Fashion, it... it's your thing.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.984
Fashion was my thing in high school.

19:04.985 --> 19:07.920
But Bayard, it's everyone's thing.

19:07.921 --> 19:11.257
Most of my classmates
grew up summering in Milan

19:11.258 --> 19:14.927
and drinking spritzes
with Dolce and Gabbana.

19:14.928 --> 19:16.729
(sighs)

19:16.730 --> 19:18.897
What if I'm not good enough?

19:21.000 --> 19:24.370
You know the most important
thing I learned in the Marines?

19:24.371 --> 19:27.706
It wasn't how to fire a gun,
or scale a wall,

19:27.707 --> 19:28.974
or even how to fly jets.

19:28.975 --> 19:30.142
Hospital corners.

19:30.143 --> 19:33.245
They taught me how to make a bed.

19:33.246 --> 19:35.948
That's not where I thought
you were going with that.

19:35.949 --> 19:37.482
Okay, the point is...

19:39.718 --> 19:41.487
...if you can accomplish one thing,

19:41.488 --> 19:43.322
even a small thing,

19:43.323 --> 19:46.325
it gives you the boost you
need to finish the mission.

19:46.326 --> 19:48.527
So what is the simplest
part of your project

19:48.528 --> 19:50.696
that you can do right now?

19:50.697 --> 19:51.931
Mount the sleeves.

19:51.932 --> 19:53.999
So, go do it.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.167
Even if they suck?

19:55.168 --> 19:57.068
Absolutely.

19:58.737 --> 20:03.042
Look, the most important part
of any project or assignment

20:03.043 --> 20:05.778
is to finish.

20:05.779 --> 20:10.249
You'll never know what you're
capable of until you start.

20:10.250 --> 20:14.086
So, get up there and,
uh, mount the sleeves...

20:14.087 --> 20:15.321
- (chuckles)
- ...and-and, you know,

20:15.322 --> 20:17.356
make something in
the shape of a dress.

20:17.357 --> 20:19.225
Okay.

20:19.226 --> 20:20.759
- Thanks, Dad.
- Mm-hmm.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.729
But you are not off the
hook for going in my room.

20:23.730 --> 20:25.831
<i>(Nogoyev speaking Russian)</i>

20:25.832 --> 20:28.601
(translating): ...maniacal, crooked,

20:28.602 --> 20:32.404
two-faced, foul, rotten.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.673
You probably get the picture.

20:34.674 --> 20:36.609
Please tell President Nogoyev

20:36.610 --> 20:38.277
that when he runs out of adjectives,

20:38.278 --> 20:41.447
I'd like to offer my sincere apology

20:41.448 --> 20:42.681
on behalf of the United States

20:42.682 --> 20:46.886
for the conduct of our ambassador.

20:46.887 --> 20:50.922
(speaking Russian)

20:52.625 --> 20:55.160
Yes, but what about my sister?

20:55.161 --> 20:56.695
Has anyone apologized to her?

20:56.696 --> 20:59.999
I am happy to do that.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.468
We sincerely regret any harm

21:02.469 --> 21:05.237
that was done to the
first family of Kyrgyzstan.

21:05.238 --> 21:07.939
(translating in Russian)

21:09.108 --> 21:10.943
(speaking Russian)

21:10.944 --> 21:12.044
Very well.

21:12.045 --> 21:14.680
Wait, uh, Mr. President,
Mr. President,

21:14.681 --> 21:19.084
I-I hope that we can agree that
it is in our mutual interest

21:19.085 --> 21:23.389
to have the Human Trafficking
Summit proceed as scheduled.

21:23.390 --> 21:27.226
(translating in Russian)

21:27.227 --> 21:28.360
Why?

21:28.361 --> 21:32.865
There is no human
trafficking in Kyrgyzstan.

21:32.866 --> 21:34.099
Are we really back to that?

21:34.100 --> 21:36.802
Then why did you agree

21:36.803 --> 21:40.072
to pay reparations to the
families of the victims?

21:40.073 --> 21:41.407
(translating)

21:41.408 --> 21:45.143
(speaking Russian)

21:49.114 --> 21:51.984
I did that out of the
charity of my heart.

21:51.985 --> 21:55.454
Much like Madonna adopted
those children from Africa.

21:55.455 --> 21:58.958
ELIZABETH: Motivation aside, you must

21:58.959 --> 22:00.993
recognize how this Summit

22:00.994 --> 22:05.030
will bolster your reputation and...

22:05.031 --> 22:08.966
(speaking Russian)

22:10.636 --> 22:12.438
Will President Dalton
come to my palace

22:12.439 --> 22:14.640
and personally apologize to my sister?

22:14.641 --> 22:17.676
Well, I'm sorry.
He's no longer coming.

22:17.677 --> 22:21.080
Then the Summit is canceled.

22:21.081 --> 22:23.482
Ooh, Mr. President,
before you go, I want to check

22:23.483 --> 22:25.918
on the welfare of your
brother-in-law, Feliks Karimov.

22:25.919 --> 22:29.154
(translating)

22:29.155 --> 22:30.422
(laughs)

22:30.423 --> 22:33.625
You dare discuss that
adulterer with me?

22:33.626 --> 22:36.028
Adultery isn't a crime
in your country.

22:36.029 --> 22:39.565
You have a responsibility
to treat him humanely.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.833
(translating)

22:43.702 --> 22:46.003
(speaking Russian)

22:47.706 --> 22:49.808
You don't tell me
how to run my family.

22:49.809 --> 22:51.343
(speaking Russian)

22:51.344 --> 22:53.445
...Madonna, "The Power of Good-bye"?

22:53.446 --> 22:56.849
Do you know that Madonna song,
"The Power of Good-bye"?

22:56.850 --> 22:59.817
Good-bye!

23:00.786 --> 23:02.821
That-that's it? The Summit's dead?

23:02.822 --> 23:04.356
Breathe, Jay.

23:04.357 --> 23:07.259
We can still salvage a lesser

23:07.260 --> 23:10.562
regional accord that'll
do plenty of good.

23:10.563 --> 23:15.034
Start looking for
an alternate host country.

23:15.035 --> 23:16.235
Tajikistan is a no.

23:16.236 --> 23:17.336
Turkmenistan, too.

23:17.337 --> 23:18.637
Kazakhstan is open to hosting,

23:18.638 --> 23:20.381
but they want to
renegotiate carbon emissions

23:20.382 --> 23:21.531
under the Stockholm Protocol.

23:21.532 --> 23:23.275
With the entire UN? Forget it.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.476
What about Uzbekistan?

23:24.477 --> 23:27.913
Stalling for time,
want to see how this plays out.

23:27.914 --> 23:29.948
All right. I'll update POTUS.

23:29.949 --> 23:32.051
Well, get back with Kazakhstan.

23:32.052 --> 23:34.053
See if they'll accept
something more bilateral.

23:34.054 --> 23:37.356
And I want you to run a
check on Feliks Karimov.

23:37.357 --> 23:40.559
We after anything specific?

23:40.560 --> 23:42.394
Ooh. Just make sure
he isn't being tortured.

23:42.395 --> 23:43.595
Not condoning torture,

23:43.596 --> 23:45.731
but is that really the
best use of our time?

23:45.732 --> 23:46.965
Is there a problem, Jay?

23:46.966 --> 23:48.534
Sorry, ma'am, but
we're circling the drain.

23:48.535 --> 23:50.302
Arranging this Summit was hard enough

23:50.303 --> 23:52.337
before our ambassador was
declared persona non grata,

23:52.338 --> 23:54.773
but now it's like putting
out a five-alarm fire

23:54.774 --> 23:56.108
with a coffee straw.

23:56.109 --> 23:58.042
I'm not exactly keen
about our prospects here.

23:58.043 --> 24:01.447
I didn't ask you to be keen.
I asked you to get it done.

24:01.448 --> 24:03.382
Of course.

24:03.383 --> 24:06.351
Hey. What the hell was that?

24:06.352 --> 24:08.087
What are you talking about?

24:08.088 --> 24:10.489
(scoffs) My friend...

24:10.490 --> 24:12.157
(clears throat)

24:12.158 --> 24:13.892
That was almost a rant.

24:13.893 --> 24:18.097
Well, I might have let my
frustration show a little.

24:18.098 --> 24:19.832
Yeah, here's the thing.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.233
You can't do that.

24:21.234 --> 24:23.435
Excuse me?

24:23.436 --> 24:27.739
It was fine when you were
the policy guy, but come on.

24:27.740 --> 24:29.074
Look around you.

24:29.075 --> 24:30.876
You're in the big office now.

24:30.877 --> 24:33.445
And when people come to you,
they expect solutions,

24:33.446 --> 24:35.214
especially the secretary.

24:35.215 --> 24:37.349
I mean, of all the times that
you were in here, did you...

24:37.350 --> 24:39.485
did you ever once see Nadine complain?

24:39.486 --> 24:41.553
You need to get it together

24:41.554 --> 24:44.155
before you make an
impression you can't fix.

24:51.537 --> 24:54.694
Ma'am, ma'am, Kazakhstan just
agreed to host the Summit

24:54.695 --> 24:57.435
in exchange for a fast track
on bilateral trade talks.

24:57.436 --> 24:58.736
Well done.

24:58.737 --> 25:00.405
And we found Feliks Karimov.

25:00.406 --> 25:02.707
Is he safe?

25:02.708 --> 25:05.176
INR tracked him
to a resort villa in Bora Bora.

25:05.177 --> 25:09.264
Well, then why hasn't he called Julia?

25:09.265 --> 25:11.867
Right, well, it's not
exactly a hard labor camp.

25:11.868 --> 25:12.684
But get this.

25:12.685 --> 25:15.460
That villa is being rented by
a front company in Curacao.

25:15.461 --> 25:16.845
(clicks tongue) Which, as I recall...

25:16.846 --> 25:20.609
Is a first choice haven
for money launderers.

25:20.610 --> 25:23.045
Call the White House.

25:23.046 --> 25:25.747
I want ODNI brought in on this.

25:25.748 --> 25:28.116
HENRY: A teak deck and plunge pool?

25:28.117 --> 25:30.452
ELIZABETH: It's $2,000 a night.

25:30.453 --> 25:33.121
(sputters) Clearly, I'm
working for the wrong people.

25:33.122 --> 25:36.291
There is no way Karimov isn't dirty.

25:36.292 --> 25:38.527
So, who's paying him off? Nogoyev?

25:38.528 --> 25:40.329
Likely.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.265
Spying on Julia would give
Kyrgyzstan an edge

25:43.266 --> 25:46.168
into our human
trafficking negotiations.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.135
NSA's into it now.

25:49.838 --> 25:52.441
I still can't believe
you're going to Afghanistan.

25:52.442 --> 25:54.509
Believe me,
I'd prefer French Polynesia.

25:54.510 --> 25:57.446
I guess I thought
that a leadership role

25:57.447 --> 26:00.716
meant you didn't have
to jet into war zones.

26:00.717 --> 26:03.018
This from a lady who
corkscrewed into the middle

26:03.019 --> 26:05.319
of a Libyan civil war last month.

26:06.054 --> 26:08.289
Here.

26:09.024 --> 26:11.626
Take these.

26:11.627 --> 26:14.118
Uh... why?

26:14.119 --> 26:15.532
Because now you have to come home safe

26:15.533 --> 26:18.166
because you have my reading glasses.

26:18.167 --> 26:20.702
(snorts, laughs)

26:20.703 --> 26:22.704
(laughs) What are you gonna
do for reading glasses?

26:22.705 --> 26:24.839
You give me a pair of yours.

26:29.311 --> 26:32.346
I feel better already.

26:33.181 --> 26:35.317
Whoa! Gol... Lord....

26:35.318 --> 26:37.586
(chuckles)

26:37.587 --> 26:41.916
Listen, as long as you're
gonna be in Kabul,

26:41.917 --> 26:44.705
you should meet with our
ambassador, Pat Findlay.

26:44.706 --> 26:46.476
He's got a deep bench of connections.

26:46.477 --> 26:48.864
Sure. I'm still building up my bench.

26:48.865 --> 26:51.166
(sighs)

26:51.167 --> 26:53.668
- (mechanical whirring)
- Okay.

26:53.669 --> 26:54.594
What?

26:54.595 --> 26:56.130
You hear that?

26:56.239 --> 26:59.306
- (whirring)
- She's really working.

27:02.184 --> 27:04.019
You know, you should consider

27:04.020 --> 27:06.388
the motivational speaker
circuit, Professor.

27:06.389 --> 27:08.614
I'm happy with my roster of clients

27:08.615 --> 27:11.293
- right here in this house.
- (laughs)

27:11.294 --> 27:13.195
Okay.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.863
You get home fast.

27:14.864 --> 27:17.031
You have my...

27:17.766 --> 27:20.068
And you have mine.

27:22.471 --> 27:23.739
Bye.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.040
Bye.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.201
(elevator bell dings)

27:36.202 --> 27:38.601
- ELIZABETH: Thank you. Morning.
- Morning.

27:38.602 --> 27:41.370
Any new information on Feliks Karimov?

27:41.371 --> 27:43.105
Not yet.

27:43.106 --> 27:44.974
What? What now?

27:44.975 --> 27:46.142
Ambassador MacDonald's

27:46.143 --> 27:48.344
persona non grata status
just broke in the press.

27:48.345 --> 27:50.179
- How much do they know?
- Everything.

27:50.458 --> 27:51.507
WOMAN (on TV): ...a
surprising new treatment

27:51.508 --> 27:54.050
for cancer, but right now,
we're following...

27:54.051 --> 27:55.585
- Diane.
- Madam Secretary.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.019
...of an alleged affair involving

27:57.020 --> 28:00.256
the American ambassador to
Kyrgyzstan, Julia MacDonald,

28:00.257 --> 28:02.124
and a member of the ruling family.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.726
Mrs. Cramer.

28:03.727 --> 28:06.762
Tell me this isn't happening.

28:06.763 --> 28:08.197
I wish I could.

28:08.198 --> 28:10.233
The bottom just fell out, ma'am.

28:10.234 --> 28:11.482
The Kazahks canceled the deal

28:11.483 --> 28:13.036
- to host the Summit.
- Of course they did.

28:13.037 --> 28:14.117
The ops center is being flooded

28:14.118 --> 28:15.816
with calls from other
signatory countries.

28:15.817 --> 28:17.006
They're dropping out.

28:17.007 --> 28:18.352
All of them?

28:18.353 --> 28:19.897
This affair is the perfect excuse.

28:19.898 --> 28:21.179
The moral authority
of the United States

28:21.180 --> 28:22.625
was the only thing keeping
most of the countries

28:22.626 --> 28:24.258
in the agreement in the first place.

28:24.259 --> 28:26.226
Now they can label us
as corrupt and unethical

28:26.227 --> 28:29.163
while avoiding any commitment
to prosecute human trafficking.

28:29.164 --> 28:32.566
It's flagrant hypocrisy,
but they have us in a corner.

28:32.567 --> 28:34.335
What if we postpone the Summit,

28:34.336 --> 28:36.904
uh, try again in a few months?

28:36.905 --> 28:38.472
Under different circumstances, maybe,

28:38.473 --> 28:39.640
but unless President Nogoyev

28:39.641 --> 28:41.108
and Kyrgyzstan get back on board,

28:41.109 --> 28:42.676
I don't see how the other countries

28:42.677 --> 28:44.078
come back to the table.

28:44.079 --> 28:46.113
- (phone ringing)
- I'm so sorry.

28:46.114 --> 28:47.481
I understand.

28:47.482 --> 28:49.480
- Hello?
- You're welcome to stay in my office

28:49.481 --> 28:50.814
until we know more.

28:50.815 --> 28:52.583
Okay, thanks.

28:52.584 --> 28:54.951
They need you at the White House.

28:56.487 --> 28:59.322
I promise you,
we are not giving up on this.

29:01.058 --> 29:04.161
STEVIE: I can't believe how
quickly you finished this.

29:04.162 --> 29:06.563
Well, I already had the
design and the fabric.

29:06.564 --> 29:08.499
All I had to do was sew.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.267
(fabric rustling)

29:10.268 --> 29:13.036
You're not saying anything
about how it looks.

29:13.037 --> 29:15.939
Just promise me I'm
not gonna get mocked

29:15.940 --> 29:17.574
and fail and then mocked more.

29:17.575 --> 29:19.743
Ali.

29:19.744 --> 29:21.979
It's awesome.

29:21.980 --> 29:23.614
Really?

29:23.615 --> 29:24.982
You don't hate it?

29:24.983 --> 29:27.484
You're crazy.

29:27.485 --> 29:28.719
I love it.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.954
So you would wear it?

29:30.955 --> 29:32.489
Absolutely.

29:32.490 --> 29:33.991
Like, in public?

29:33.992 --> 29:36.360
I mean, you know, obviously
for the right occasion,

29:36.361 --> 29:37.461
but... totes.

29:37.462 --> 29:39.796
Maybe like a fashion show?

29:39.797 --> 29:42.666
At Bayard tonight?

29:42.667 --> 29:46.603
In my paralysis and panic

29:46.604 --> 29:49.740
about my adequacy as a
designer and human being,

29:49.741 --> 29:52.776
I forgot to book a model
for the presentation.

29:52.777 --> 29:55.913
(scoffs) Um...

29:55.914 --> 29:57.948
Yeah, I don't know, I...

29:57.949 --> 29:59.683
I'm already late for work,

29:59.684 --> 30:03.153
and I've been putting in pretty
long hours these days, so...

30:03.154 --> 30:04.721
It starts at 9:00.

30:04.722 --> 30:05.988
Please?

30:06.690 --> 30:09.359
I just really hate being on stage.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.660
I mean, I'll probably trip.

30:14.031 --> 30:15.065
(sighs) Okay,

30:15.066 --> 30:16.233
I will do it, I will do it.

30:16.234 --> 30:17.692
Oh, my God. Thank you!

30:17.693 --> 30:18.672
You're very welcome.

30:18.673 --> 30:20.270
- Can you undo the thingy at the top?
- Yes.

30:20.271 --> 30:22.105
WARE: <i>NSA was able</i>

30:22.106 --> 30:24.374
to spearfish the shell corporation

30:24.375 --> 30:26.410
that Feliks Karimov was using

30:26.411 --> 30:29.012
to pay for his villa in Bora Bora.

30:29.013 --> 30:31.682
Our suspicion that
he's a foreign agent

30:31.683 --> 30:33.083
has been confirmed.

30:33.084 --> 30:34.918
So he was spying for Kyrgyzstan.

30:34.919 --> 30:36.186
WARE: No, Mr. President.

30:36.187 --> 30:38.954
His payments were coming from the GRU.

30:40.157 --> 30:43.026
You're telling me
one of our top diplomats,

30:43.027 --> 30:46.129
with the same security
clearance as a four-star general,

30:46.130 --> 30:48.577
was seduced by a Russian spy?

30:48.578 --> 30:50.347
The threat was much more
significant than

30:50.348 --> 30:52.114
- we initially realized.
- We have to find out

30:52.115 --> 30:53.582
exactly what she told him.

30:53.583 --> 30:54.716
Is she in custody yet?

30:54.717 --> 30:56.885
FBI is detaining her as we speak.

30:56.886 --> 30:59.521
But pillow talk is the
least of our worries.

30:59.522 --> 31:02.257
Cyber Division found a cryptoworm

31:02.258 --> 31:05.594
implanted on the embassy
servers in Bishkek.

31:05.595 --> 31:07.361
So they hacked us, too?

31:08.230 --> 31:11.300
Sir, they could have accessed

31:11.301 --> 31:14.569
our entire military
and political strategy

31:14.570 --> 31:15.537
in Central Asia.

31:15.538 --> 31:17.506
Ephraim, have FBI forensics

31:17.507 --> 31:19.908
tear into every server
and fiber optic cable

31:19.909 --> 31:20.876
between here and Bishkek.

31:20.877 --> 31:22.611
We need to know how deep this goes

31:22.612 --> 31:23.952
and just how vulnerable we are.

31:32.905 --> 31:35.774
He asked a lot about our
regional vaccine program.

31:35.775 --> 31:38.217
He was the Minister of Health.

31:38.218 --> 31:39.785
His curiosity seemed normal.

31:39.786 --> 31:41.387
FBI AGENT: And at any point

31:41.388 --> 31:43.755
did you leave him alone
with your computer?

31:45.992 --> 31:47.593
JULIA: Yes.

31:47.594 --> 31:50.596
Many times.

31:50.597 --> 31:52.632
This is heartbreaking.

31:52.633 --> 31:55.835
Yeah, for national security.

31:55.836 --> 31:59.505
Not to mention our entire
political agenda.

31:59.506 --> 32:02.975
Senator Morejon's people have
already cut an attack ad.

32:02.976 --> 32:04.644
"Diplomats gone wild."

32:04.645 --> 32:06.979
And that's just for the affair.

32:06.980 --> 32:09.115
Wait till they get a
whiff of the IC breach.

32:09.116 --> 32:10.850
How bad is the breach looking,

32:10.851 --> 32:11.784
by the way?

32:11.785 --> 32:13.452
Our initial assessment is...

32:13.453 --> 32:15.388
cautiously optimistic.

32:15.389 --> 32:19.859
It looks like the GRU only
gained access to local intel

32:19.860 --> 32:21.827
at the Confidential level.

32:21.828 --> 32:24.598
Fortunately, our strategic interests

32:24.599 --> 32:25.799
in Kyrgyzstan are limited.

32:25.800 --> 32:26.807
(sighs)

32:26.808 --> 32:29.242
All right. I'll update POTUS.

32:29.243 --> 32:31.978
Let's pray to God we keep
this thing contained.

32:31.979 --> 32:34.214
(door opens)

32:34.215 --> 32:35.782
HENRY: <i>So does this mean</i>

32:35.783 --> 32:37.351
your human trafficking summit is dead?

32:37.352 --> 32:40.120
ELIZABETH: Uh, the preferred term

32:40.121 --> 32:41.955
is "on life support."

32:41.956 --> 32:43.557
(chuckles)

32:43.558 --> 32:45.559
How's it going over there?

32:45.560 --> 32:46.760
Rather smooth so far.

32:46.761 --> 32:48.729
I'm just finishing up
the official briefings. _

32:48.730 --> 32:50.330
Then I'm gonna head
straight over to the embassy

32:50.331 --> 32:51.865
to meet with Ambassador Findlay.

32:51.866 --> 32:53.600
Stay safe.

32:53.601 --> 32:55.469
I will. Oh, wait.

32:55.470 --> 32:57.237
How did Ali's dress turn out?

32:57.238 --> 32:58.772
Oh, I got intel from Stevie.

32:58.773 --> 33:00.874
Thumbs up. Nice.

33:00.875 --> 33:02.042
(chuckles)

33:02.043 --> 33:03.577
You got your own deep game.

33:03.578 --> 33:06.111
Yeah. Motherhood.

33:10.016 --> 33:11.818
Ambassador Findlay.

33:11.819 --> 33:13.720
Henry McCord.
Thanks for seeing me so late.

33:13.721 --> 33:15.222
Of course. Please.

33:15.223 --> 33:17.357
I was glad to hear that
Special Activities Division

33:17.358 --> 33:19.559
was ramping up operations in-country.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.161
Oh, so you're up to speed.

33:21.162 --> 33:24.064
CIA posted the briefing
on JWICS an hour ago.

33:24.065 --> 33:26.333
You're establishing a safe house.

33:26.334 --> 33:28.168
Yes. A-And what we're trying to do

33:28.169 --> 33:29.903
is build a picture of GRU recruitment

33:29.904 --> 33:31.271
within the Afghan government,

33:31.272 --> 33:32.606
so anything you may have heard...

33:32.607 --> 33:35.342
Well, my face-to-face
interaction with the Russians

33:35.343 --> 33:37.544
is pretty minimal, but, um,

33:37.545 --> 33:41.581
we do have mutual contacts
in the business community.

33:41.582 --> 33:43.048
This is...

33:43.817 --> 33:46.353
...Ali Muslimyar.

33:46.354 --> 33:48.488
He's a local construction magnate

33:48.489 --> 33:50.123
who buys heavy equipment
from the Russians.

33:50.124 --> 33:52.926
I can introduce you.

33:52.927 --> 33:55.829
Uh, is that you with Julia MacDonald?

33:55.830 --> 33:56.997
Yes.

33:56.998 --> 33:58.965
That's from the vaccine program

33:58.966 --> 34:00.467
we've been coordinating together.

34:00.468 --> 34:01.601
Shame what happened to her.

34:01.602 --> 34:02.702
I-I never got the full...

34:02.703 --> 34:04.204
Excuse me, this coordination.

34:04.205 --> 34:05.739
Did it take place over e-mail?

34:05.740 --> 34:07.040
Sometimes, yes.

34:07.041 --> 34:09.176
And the briefing
you just saw on JWICS,

34:09.177 --> 34:12.746
did it include the location
of the safe house?

34:12.746 --> 34:15.215
Yes, but... What?

34:15.216 --> 34:16.882
<i>(line ringing)</i>

34:16.884 --> 34:19.018
HENRY: <i>Come on. Pick up, pick up.</i>

34:19.020 --> 34:21.087
This is Scepter.

34:21.088 --> 34:23.356
We've been compromised.
Initiate evacuation

34:23.357 --> 34:25.592
- procedure Delta.
- Delta. Acknowledged.

34:25.592 --> 34:27.994
Code Delta! Lock it down! Go, go, go!

34:27.995 --> 34:29.094
What the hell happened?

34:29.096 --> 34:30.931
The ambassador may have
been hacked by GRU.

34:30.931 --> 34:32.966
And he had access to our
safe house location.

34:32.967 --> 34:34.467
I'm half a block away,

34:34.469 --> 34:36.434
I've got room for five in my vehicle.
Get out of there.

34:36.435 --> 34:38.672
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

34:38.672 --> 34:40.607
(tires screeching)

34:40.608 --> 34:43.143
- Damn it.
- (horns honking)

34:43.143 --> 34:44.543
(tires screech)

34:45.277 --> 34:47.580
(truck horn blows)

34:49.616 --> 34:52.284
(chickens clucking)

34:59.125 --> 35:00.427
(car alarm beeping)

35:00.428 --> 35:02.094
(people shouting, screaming)

35:06.158 --> 35:09.160
Our drone is coming into position now.

35:09.895 --> 35:12.723
God. The size of that thing.

35:12.724 --> 35:14.224
Must have been a truck bomb.

35:14.225 --> 35:16.793
Dr. McCord said
it was a suicide attack,

35:16.794 --> 35:18.395
followed by a sweep
of Taliban fighters.

35:18.396 --> 35:20.931
Yeah, if anyone was still inside...

35:20.932 --> 35:23.033
DALTON: Has Henry made
contact with his team yet?

35:23.034 --> 35:25.202
Burn protocol calls for radio silence.

35:25.203 --> 35:26.537
We'll be in the dark

35:26.538 --> 35:30.007
until he reaches his
predetermined rendezvous point.

35:30.008 --> 35:31.942
Call Admiral Parker.

35:31.943 --> 35:35.112
I want Taliban decapitation
strike options on my desk

35:35.113 --> 35:36.246
within the hour.

35:36.247 --> 35:37.681
I have Dr. McCord.

35:37.682 --> 35:40.017
DALTON: Put him on speaker, Colonel.

35:40.018 --> 35:41.685
(phone beeps)

35:41.686 --> 35:44.021
Henry?

35:44.022 --> 35:46.190
Uh, is, uh... is your team okay?

35:46.191 --> 35:47.424
HENRY: Uh, some cuts,

35:47.425 --> 35:49.660
and burst eardrums,
but we're all standing.

35:49.661 --> 35:52.296
Guards closed the perimeter
just in time.

35:52.297 --> 35:54.731
DALTON: CENTCOM has a pair of
Chinooks en route to the embassy.

35:54.732 --> 35:56.099
I've ordered the evacuation

35:56.100 --> 35:59.069
of all American high-ranking
personnel until further notice.

35:59.070 --> 36:00.971
He means bring your ass home, Henry.

36:00.972 --> 36:02.439
(soft laughter)

36:02.440 --> 36:04.007
Yes, honey.

36:04.008 --> 36:05.876
And Mr. President.

36:05.877 --> 36:07.844
All right, listen up.

36:07.845 --> 36:10.601
We need to know who orchestrated
these attacks from Moscow,

36:10.602 --> 36:11.908
and see if they're planning any more.

36:11.909 --> 36:13.719
I'll signal Bakunin,
see if he knows anything.

36:13.720 --> 36:14.815
Good. The rest of you, do the same.

36:14.816 --> 36:16.301
Question your assets,
get them to safety

36:16.302 --> 36:17.603
and let's go.

36:21.187 --> 36:22.655
TRANSLATOR: <i>I am outraged</i>

36:22.656 --> 36:24.290
to hear that my brother-in-law

36:24.291 --> 36:26.759
was working for the Russian GRU.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.861
(speaking Russian)

36:28.862 --> 36:31.064
(translated):
But I see no reason to reinstate

36:31.065 --> 36:32.832
this Summit on Human Trafficking

36:32.833 --> 36:35.868
or to pay these
outrageous reparations.

36:35.869 --> 36:38.137
Seriously, not a hint of remorse?

36:38.138 --> 36:40.540
If anything, the fault lies
with your harlot

36:40.541 --> 36:42.175
of an ambassador.

36:42.176 --> 36:43.709
She is the one who corrupted him.

36:43.710 --> 36:45.044
ELIZABETH: Here's the thing.

36:45.045 --> 36:48.314
Feliks Karimov is a member
of your government.

36:48.315 --> 36:51.451
(speaking Russian)

36:51.452 --> 36:53.419
Minister of health, so what?

36:53.420 --> 36:54.887
I'll fire him tomorrow.

36:54.888 --> 36:56.889
Feel free.
But that won't change the fact

36:56.890 --> 36:58.591
that your brother-in-law
helped the Russians

36:58.592 --> 36:59.926
cyberattack the United States.

36:59.927 --> 37:04.363
And for that, I'm holding you
personally responsible.

37:04.364 --> 37:06.766
Please, Madam Secretary.

37:06.767 --> 37:09.135
I am a powerful man.

37:09.136 --> 37:11.304
How-how do you say, uh...?

37:11.305 --> 37:13.272
Bang, bang. Untouchable.

37:13.273 --> 37:14.507
ELIZABETH: Maybe.

37:14.508 --> 37:16.642
But your money isn't.

37:16.643 --> 37:18.444
Feliks Karimov was a
member of your cabinet,

37:18.445 --> 37:20.012
which gives us the legal authority

37:20.013 --> 37:21.848
to apply targeted sanctions.

37:21.849 --> 37:23.182
You're bluffing.

37:23.183 --> 37:24.984
JAY: Treasury is freezing
your accounts

37:24.985 --> 37:26.586
as we speak.

37:26.587 --> 37:31.724
This is a one-time offer that'll
expire when we end this call:

37:31.725 --> 37:35.428
reinstate the Summit
on Human Trafficking

37:35.429 --> 37:37.530
and bring all signatory countries

37:37.531 --> 37:39.565
back to the table immediately.

37:39.566 --> 37:44.036
You know that Madonna song, "Hung Up"?

37:44.037 --> 37:46.606
I am about to hang up on you.

37:46.607 --> 37:47.673
<i>Da.</i>

37:47.674 --> 37:48.674
(Nogoyev chuckles)

37:48.675 --> 37:51.978
I'll have my people reach out.

37:51.979 --> 37:53.112
Great.

37:53.113 --> 37:54.546
(computer beeps)

37:55.882 --> 37:59.452
- ♪
- Two-minute warning.

37:59.453 --> 38:01.753
This was a bad idea.

38:02.688 --> 38:04.023
(exhales)

38:04.024 --> 38:06.157
This was a very bad idea.

38:07.059 --> 38:08.294
You ready to rock?

38:08.295 --> 38:11.631
Uh, I just need to, um...

38:11.632 --> 38:14.200
I just need to sit down for a minute.

38:14.201 --> 38:15.468
You're gonna be great.

38:15.469 --> 38:17.469
Remember, they're judging me, not you.

38:19.539 --> 38:22.008
Jareth and I broke off the engagement.

38:22.009 --> 38:23.776
What?

38:23.777 --> 38:25.178
Oh, my God. When?

38:25.179 --> 38:26.412
A few days ago.

38:26.413 --> 38:29.382
Um...

38:29.383 --> 38:33.920
I thought we were gonna
just take some time.

38:33.921 --> 38:36.355
(crying): But he called,

38:36.356 --> 38:38.124
and he... he pulled the plug.

38:38.125 --> 38:41.861
So, I just, I haven't
really been sleeping

38:41.862 --> 38:43.829
and I just, I get stage fright

38:43.830 --> 38:45.264
even when I'm really well-rested

38:45.265 --> 38:48.935
and... happy.

38:48.936 --> 38:52.572
So... (sniffles)

38:52.573 --> 38:55.341
I just don't think I can do this, Ali.

38:55.342 --> 38:57.610
I'm really sorry.

38:57.611 --> 39:00.213
(crying)

39:00.214 --> 39:02.648
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

39:02.649 --> 39:04.517
And I really feel terrible,

39:04.518 --> 39:06.686
and I promise I want to talk about it

39:06.687 --> 39:08.354
and watch dumb comedies and trash him,

39:08.355 --> 39:09.989
or not, if you're not ready.

39:09.990 --> 39:12.558
But right now, I need you
to walk across this stage

39:12.559 --> 39:15.727
and smile with your
eyes so I don't fail.

39:17.363 --> 39:18.598
Okay.

39:18.599 --> 39:22.435
(announcer speaking indistinctly)

39:22.436 --> 39:25.838
Like this?

39:25.839 --> 39:27.540
(both laugh)

39:27.541 --> 39:29.108
Let's go, ladies. You're on.

39:29.109 --> 39:30.576
- Okay.
- (exhales)

39:30.577 --> 39:31.677
- Am I good?
- Don't...

39:31.678 --> 39:33.779
- (sniffles)
- Let me get that. Ooh.

39:33.780 --> 39:35.181
- Perfect.
- Okay, okay.

39:35.182 --> 39:37.250
ANNOUNCER: From fashion
designer Alison McCord,

39:37.251 --> 39:39.719
our next look is a
white scoop-neck dress

39:39.720 --> 39:41.020
with three-quarter length sleeves

39:41.021 --> 39:43.722
and chiffon coral ruffles.

39:48.027 --> 39:49.161
Ma'am.

39:49.162 --> 39:50.363
- Yeah.
- It's done.

39:50.364 --> 39:52.331
I need more.

39:52.332 --> 39:54.033
All the original signatories
are back on board.

39:54.034 --> 39:56.068
All we have to do is gas up the jet.

39:56.069 --> 39:57.870
- That's a big win.
- Yeah.

39:57.871 --> 39:59.772
(stammering): Yeah, and
that should give Dalton

39:59.773 --> 40:03.442
the cover he needs to revive
his infrastructure plan.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.878
Not exactly how I scripted it.

40:05.879 --> 40:07.647
Oh, I'll take it.

40:07.648 --> 40:11.450
I wanted to, uh,
apologize for yesterday.

40:11.451 --> 40:15.087
I know, uh, grumbling isn't
part of the job description.

40:15.088 --> 40:16.355
I won't let it happen again.

40:16.356 --> 40:20.826
Oh. Don't make promises
you can't keep, Jay.

40:20.827 --> 40:24.630
I love your passion.

40:24.631 --> 40:28.701
That's why you got the job.

40:28.702 --> 40:30.503
Yeah, maybe, just...

40:30.504 --> 40:33.706
would prefer it
attached to a solution...

40:33.707 --> 40:36.609
Otherwise, it's just grumbling.

40:36.610 --> 40:38.844
It's a process.

40:38.845 --> 40:40.246
You'll figure it out.

40:40.247 --> 40:42.481
But do you like the job?

40:42.482 --> 40:44.016
Because if you're having
second thoughts...

40:44.017 --> 40:45.117
No... second thoughts?

40:45.118 --> 40:46.285
No second thoughts, no.

40:46.286 --> 40:47.453
I think you're stuck with me.

40:47.454 --> 40:51.290
Great. That's exactly
how I scripted it.

40:51.291 --> 40:53.626
Now let's go deliver the good news.

40:53.627 --> 40:55.494
Diane...

40:55.495 --> 40:58.064
This guy...

40:58.065 --> 40:59.332
- he made it happen.
- It's happening?

40:59.333 --> 41:00.900
- It's happening.
- Thank you!

41:00.901 --> 41:03.869
(laughs): Thank you.

41:03.870 --> 41:05.304
Thank you.

41:05.305 --> 41:06.639
STEVIE: Oh, my God!

41:06.640 --> 41:07.707
(all laugh)

41:07.708 --> 41:08.874
ELIZABETH: That was...

41:08.875 --> 41:10.543
what was that?

41:10.544 --> 41:12.211
(laughs): I don't know.

41:12.212 --> 41:13.913
Fourth position, maybe?

41:13.914 --> 41:16.015
It's like reaching deep
into my preschool ballet.

41:16.016 --> 41:18.584
Yeah, you-you definitely,
you went deep for that one.

41:18.585 --> 41:19.919
Yeah, I did.

41:19.920 --> 41:24.724
But, Ali, this is the dress
that you were so worried about?

41:24.725 --> 41:26.425
I'm stunned.

41:26.426 --> 41:28.961
Uh, it's just...
even your brother is impressed.

41:28.962 --> 41:31.797
Well, it's definitely
not a shower curtain.

41:31.798 --> 41:33.566
- Thanks, Jace.
- (phone beeping)

41:33.567 --> 41:35.000
When's Dad getting home?

41:35.001 --> 41:36.669
Uh, he'll be back
first thing in the morning.

41:36.670 --> 41:38.838
He is gonna be over the moon for you.

41:38.839 --> 41:40.673
Okay, listen, I have
something that I've got to do.

41:40.674 --> 41:42.708
I will see you budding artists...

41:42.709 --> 41:44.009
(groans) in the morning.

41:44.010 --> 41:46.211
- Good night.
- Night. - Good night.

41:52.251 --> 41:53.285
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, baby.

41:53.286 --> 41:54.954
- I expected to see you at home.
- Yeah.

41:54.955 --> 41:57.690
This is not the reunion
I had hoped for.

41:57.691 --> 41:59.625
Blake said it's an emergency.

41:59.626 --> 42:01.060
Nafisa Samadi's disappeared.

42:01.061 --> 42:02.395
That's your agent in Kabul, right?

42:02.396 --> 42:04.696
Her Russian contact
has also gone missing.

42:06.165 --> 42:07.666
DALTON: What's the sitrep, Ephraim?

42:07.667 --> 42:10.369
NSA picked up chatter that suggests

42:10.370 --> 42:12.071
the kidnapping was the Taliban.

42:12.072 --> 42:13.272
HENRY: Are they alive?

42:13.273 --> 42:14.607
Unknown.

42:14.608 --> 42:15.808
DALTON: Let's have DOD

42:15.809 --> 42:17.877
form a crisis action cell.
I want Deltas

42:17.878 --> 42:19.178
on every checkpoint out of the city.

42:19.179 --> 42:20.546
Yes, sir.

42:20.547 --> 42:23.149
They knew exactly where to find them.

42:23.150 --> 42:24.383
How?

42:24.384 --> 42:25.918
Computer breach?

42:25.919 --> 42:27.520
No, that's not possible.

42:27.521 --> 42:29.422
Their locale was too
compartmentalized.

42:29.423 --> 42:31.189
Henry's right.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.926
There's only one other option.

42:35.895 --> 42:39.491
The Taliban were tipped off
by someone on our side.
