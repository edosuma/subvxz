WEBVTT

00:03.583 --> 00:04.859
<i>Weren't we just out</i>
<i>at this school</i>

00:04.860 --> 00:06.026
a few months back?

00:06.028 --> 00:07.994
Kid got shot in the cafeteria.

00:07.996 --> 00:10.697
Yeah, that'll make you lose
your appetite quick.

00:10.699 --> 00:13.967
Look at this mess.

00:15.971 --> 00:17.370
What do we got?

00:17.372 --> 00:19.606
Argument broke out
just after first bell.

00:19.608 --> 00:22.209
Someone pulls out a gun
and starts shooting.

00:22.211 --> 00:23.843
Anyone see the shooter?
No one came forward.

00:23.845 --> 00:25.445
Come on, this yard had to be
full of kids

00:25.447 --> 00:26.479
at the time of shooting.

00:26.481 --> 00:27.547
Nobody saw anything?

00:27.549 --> 00:29.649
I said no one came forward,

00:29.651 --> 00:31.284
and I wouldn't hold your breath.
- Copy that.

00:31.286 --> 00:32.552
Hey, kid.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.354
What's your name?

00:34.356 --> 00:36.389
You got shot in the leg,
not in your ears.

00:36.391 --> 00:37.524
What's your name?

00:37.526 --> 00:38.792
Hector.
- Hector.

00:38.794 --> 00:40.327
You have any idea
who did this to you?

00:40.329 --> 00:41.861
I ain't got nothing to say.

00:41.863 --> 00:43.697
Hector here runs
with the Warrior Kings.

00:43.699 --> 00:44.864
Well, he's not
gonna be running

00:44.866 --> 00:45.932
with anyone
anytime soon.

00:45.934 --> 00:47.534
Come on. Tell me
who shot you, kid.

00:47.536 --> 00:49.002
This is Warrior King business.

00:49.004 --> 00:50.303
I don't need no cops.

00:50.305 --> 00:51.404
Suit yourself, tough guy.

00:51.406 --> 00:53.873
Get him the hell out of here.

00:56.077 --> 00:58.745
Getting the feeling nobody
around here trusts cops.

00:58.747 --> 01:00.947
They don't.

01:01.882 --> 01:03.450
You the man in charge?
On paper, anyway.

01:03.452 --> 01:04.650
Principal Darryl Ward.

01:04.653 --> 01:06.586
Detective Reagan,
Detective Baez.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.655
Looks like you got a gang
problem right here.

01:08.657 --> 01:10.023
What was your first clue?

01:10.025 --> 01:12.292
About a year ago, the Ace Double
Treys and the Warrior Kings

01:12.294 --> 01:13.760
started recruiting here.

01:13.762 --> 01:15.528
You reach out
to the gang unit?

01:15.530 --> 01:17.464
Apparently, they're more
interested in gangbangers

01:17.466 --> 01:19.232
a bit higher up the food chain.
Uh-huh.

01:19.234 --> 01:22.269
We only have a handful of
students with gang affiliation,

01:22.271 --> 01:24.104
all in our special ed program.

01:24.106 --> 01:25.438
Okay, so what could we do, then?

01:25.440 --> 01:28.541
I requested metal detectors
and updated security cameras

01:28.543 --> 01:30.310
14 months ago.

01:30.312 --> 01:34.981
It would be nice to get them
before someone gets killed.

01:37.786 --> 01:41.221
Called you as soon as I found
out it was Cochran, Morrow.

01:41.223 --> 01:42.555
You said there was a fatality?

01:42.557 --> 01:43.857
One of the lawyers.

01:43.859 --> 01:45.058
They cut him up pretty good.

01:45.060 --> 01:47.527
A.D.A. Reagan. Have you
identified the victim yet?

01:47.529 --> 01:49.062
Yeah. He was one
of the partners.

01:49.064 --> 01:51.364
Mickey Rodansky?

01:51.366 --> 01:53.199
Rodansky's the one
who found him.

01:53.201 --> 01:54.601
Over there.

02:01.409 --> 02:03.076
Scared the hell out of me.

02:03.078 --> 02:06.313
Trust me,
I'm pretty damn scared myself.

02:08.115 --> 02:10.783
What the hell
happened?

02:10.786 --> 02:13.420
I mean, I-I came in early
to finish some work,

02:13.422 --> 02:15.322
and the place was trashed.

02:15.324 --> 02:17.624
And-and James...

02:18.492 --> 02:20.360
Oh, God.

02:20.362 --> 02:21.528
You called Janice?

02:21.530 --> 02:22.595
Yeah.

02:22.597 --> 02:23.663
You know what she said?

02:23.665 --> 02:25.065
What?

02:25.067 --> 02:27.033
That's what you get
for leaving the D.A.'s office.

02:27.035 --> 02:29.002
Detective said

02:29.004 --> 02:31.004
she's got what
she needs for now.

02:31.006 --> 02:35.375
Okay. We'll give you
a ride home, Mickey.

02:35.377 --> 02:36.576
I don't know why.

02:36.578 --> 02:39.145
Don't know why or
don't know why yet?

02:39.147 --> 02:41.047
Okay, yet.

02:41.049 --> 02:42.982
The governor called me
twice this morning.

02:42.984 --> 02:44.584
What kind of threat level
that say to you?

02:44.586 --> 02:45.618
Threat level?

02:45.620 --> 02:47.854
He didn't call me
just to say hi.

02:47.856 --> 02:50.924
I would like a little Intel
before I call him back.

02:50.926 --> 02:52.258
The problem is,
the calls didn't come through

02:52.260 --> 02:54.494
the governor's staff
and go through me.

02:54.496 --> 02:56.262
He placed the calls himself.

02:56.264 --> 02:57.530
I know.

02:57.532 --> 03:00.433
Is there a threat level
I don't know about?

03:00.435 --> 03:02.635
I don't know. Yet.

03:02.637 --> 03:05.105
I got an update
on that shooting in the Village.

03:05.107 --> 03:06.306
Two unis responded

03:06.308 --> 03:08.641
to a fight between a hipster
and a couple of guidos

03:08.643 --> 03:10.643
from one of them gastropubs.

03:10.645 --> 03:11.644
Gastropub? Which one?

03:11.646 --> 03:12.712
$20 for a cheeseburger--

03:12.714 --> 03:13.747
who cares which one?

03:13.749 --> 03:15.081
And?
One of the guidos

03:15.083 --> 03:16.216
pulled a gun,

03:16.218 --> 03:18.451
threw a shot at our people,
who returned fire,

03:18.453 --> 03:20.720
striking the perp
and a bystander at the bar.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.422
I heard all about that
at 2:00 a.m.

03:22.424 --> 03:25.658
Well, what you haven't heard
is the bystander was ID'd

03:25.660 --> 03:28.061
as Lawrence Cobb.

03:28.063 --> 03:29.996
And I care why?

03:29.998 --> 03:34.534
Cobb is a top legislative aide
to Governor Mendez.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.576
That thing where I didn't know
why the governor was calling?

04:15.763 --> 04:16.796
- Nah, I don't.
- Huh.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.365
- You know Hector Alou?
- Yeah.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.226
So?

04:21.228 --> 04:24.596
So, sit down.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.165
Somebody shot Hector
at your school today.

04:27.167 --> 04:27.875
What's that got to do with me?

04:27.876 --> 04:30.377
We've got you on video
running from the scene.

04:30.379 --> 04:32.212
Yeah, bodega on the corner
got a real nice shot

04:32.214 --> 04:33.513
of you sprinting away.

04:33.515 --> 04:34.848
Ain't against
the law to run.

04:34.850 --> 04:36.583
You were heading
away from school.

04:36.585 --> 04:37.951
I forgot my homework.

04:37.953 --> 04:40.053
You know, something tells me
you're not much of a scholar.

04:40.055 --> 04:42.189
Let's see if you
can do this math.

04:42.191 --> 04:44.024
You got a Ace Double Treys
tattoo on your neck,

04:44.026 --> 04:46.293
the victim was a member
of the Warrior Kings.

04:46.295 --> 04:47.561
Sound like a coincidence to you?

04:47.563 --> 04:48.929
You tell me.

04:48.931 --> 04:50.530
You're the cop.
What are you, 17?

04:50.532 --> 04:52.832
Let's see if you can do
this math problem.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.468
You're 17 when we find the gun
that you used

04:55.470 --> 04:57.337
and tie it to you-- that's gonna
get you four to seven.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.739
Which means your ass
won't get out till you're 24.

04:59.741 --> 05:01.208
And by that time,

05:01.210 --> 05:03.176
your 16-year-old girlfriend's
probably gonna have three kids

05:03.178 --> 05:04.911
from your 20-year-old
best friend.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.246
All right, all right, Professor.

05:06.248 --> 05:07.480
Why don't y'all just arrest me?

05:07.482 --> 05:10.684
This is your one chance
to come clean and help yourself.

05:12.787 --> 05:14.054
So y'all ain't got nothing.

05:14.056 --> 05:15.855
We've got a playground
full of witnesses.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.023
And it's only
a matter of time

05:17.025 --> 05:20.327
before somebody rats
out your punk ass.

05:20.329 --> 05:22.896
If this <i>is</i> gang business,

05:22.898 --> 05:26.433
ain't nobody getting
in the middle of it.

05:27.868 --> 05:29.469
So charge me...

05:31.138 --> 05:33.506
...or let me the hell up
out of here.

05:35.610 --> 05:37.877
You think I sold out?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.180
Definitely.

05:40.182 --> 05:42.849
Well, James wanted to expand
into white collar crime

05:42.851 --> 05:46.453
and then he brought me in
to head the department.

05:47.856 --> 05:49.623
I still can't believe he's dead.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.891
Did he have any enemies
that may have done this?

05:51.893 --> 05:52.993
No.

05:52.995 --> 05:54.561
I mean, what kind of person
would do that

05:54.563 --> 05:55.962
to another human being?

05:55.964 --> 05:58.765
Why did he keep
so much cash on hand?

05:58.767 --> 06:00.900
He had it for
cash bonds.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.503
For loans to clients
who were in trouble.

06:03.505 --> 06:06.172
So any number of criminal
defendants could have known

06:06.174 --> 06:08.141
that safe was stuffed with cash.

06:08.143 --> 06:11.845
I keep seeing his face, Erin.

06:13.514 --> 06:15.982
You're gonna be okay.

06:18.487 --> 06:20.520
Thanks.

06:20.522 --> 06:22.188
We're gonna have to do
a drive-by with the press

06:22.190 --> 06:23.223
down the hall.

06:23.225 --> 06:24.457
Okay, but keep it moving.

06:24.459 --> 06:25.759
Like I said, a drive-by.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.595
There he is.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.202
Governor. The
press has a few questions.

06:36.204 --> 06:39.339
They know my man was wounded
by a cop's bullet?

06:39.341 --> 06:41.908
That has not been released
as of yet.

06:41.910 --> 06:43.610
Then they will hear it from me.

06:43.612 --> 06:47.013
Governor. Please, a second?

06:51.219 --> 06:52.585
What would be the point?

06:52.587 --> 06:54.054
The facts would be the point.

06:54.056 --> 06:56.723
The facts are it was
a fluid and chaotic situation,

06:56.725 --> 06:59.893
and the actions of my people
prevented even more harm.

06:59.895 --> 07:01.227
And shot my guy.

07:01.229 --> 07:02.862
Which was tragic.

07:02.864 --> 07:05.665
But not, under the
circumstances, avoidable.

07:05.667 --> 07:08.368
I know you guys like
to whitewash

07:08.370 --> 07:09.703
officer-involved shootings.

07:09.705 --> 07:10.870
I do not.

07:10.872 --> 07:12.339
That's not gonna happen here.

07:12.341 --> 07:16.209
I want the cop that shot my aide
fired and charged.

07:16.211 --> 07:18.778
If the grand jury indicts,

07:18.780 --> 07:22.582
my officer could be terminated.

07:23.984 --> 07:26.686
We all want to protect
our people, Frank.

07:26.688 --> 07:29.856
But in the natural order
of things, mine come first.

07:29.858 --> 07:32.392
Don't forget that.

07:36.430 --> 07:37.931
My name is Detective Reagan.

07:37.933 --> 07:39.466
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

07:39.468 --> 07:40.767
We want to thank all of you

07:40.769 --> 07:42.736
for allowing us
into your classroom today,

07:42.738 --> 07:44.904
and especially
your teacher Ms. Chavez

07:44.906 --> 07:46.840
for allowing us to speak
to all of you today.

07:46.842 --> 07:49.209
If you're recruiting
for the NYPD, you definitely

07:49.211 --> 07:51.111
on the wrong place, yo.

07:52.748 --> 07:54.114
All right,
quiet down, come on.

07:54.116 --> 07:55.715
Quiet down,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:55.717 --> 07:57.684
Go on, Detective.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.719
Now, as all of you know,
one of your classmates was shot

07:59.721 --> 08:01.054
in the playground the other day.

08:01.056 --> 08:04.290
So far, nobody's come forward
with any information.

08:04.292 --> 08:06.760
Duh. You got that right.

08:06.762 --> 08:09.095
Look, we can understand why
some of you might be hesitant

08:09.097 --> 08:12.899
to come forward with any
information that you might have.

08:12.901 --> 08:15.802
There are some knuckleheads
in this school.

08:15.804 --> 08:19.406
In fact, I see some of them
here today.

08:19.408 --> 08:23.810
Those guys like to act tough,
but they're not.

08:23.812 --> 08:27.347
They hang out in gangs
and hide out in gangs

08:27.349 --> 08:30.750
'cause they don't have the
guts to stand up on their own.

08:30.752 --> 08:33.886
You guys want to make this
school a better and safer place,

08:33.889 --> 08:37.056
you're gonna have to have the
guts to stand up on your own.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.058
My partner's gonna hand out
our business card.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.393
It has our number on it.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.328
If you saw anything that can
help us identify the person

08:43.331 --> 08:45.732
who shot your classmate
and friend,

08:45.734 --> 08:48.968
we'd appreciate you
giving us a call.

08:48.970 --> 08:51.938
We know what's at stake
when you make a call like this.

08:51.940 --> 08:55.809
So it'll be
completely confidential.

08:57.878 --> 08:59.712
I got to say, I don't envy you.

08:59.714 --> 09:01.748
Dealing with that crew
every day.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.583
They grow on you.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.751
Like a tumor.

09:04.753 --> 09:05.985
You think anyone
will come forward?

09:05.987 --> 09:07.053
Honestly,

09:07.055 --> 09:08.555
I'd be very surprised.

09:08.557 --> 09:09.789
They don't trust cops.

09:09.791 --> 09:11.024
Yeah,
we got that part.

09:11.026 --> 09:12.058
Let's face it.

09:12.060 --> 09:13.293
The only time you guys
ever show up

09:13.295 --> 09:15.228
is when someone
gets stabbed or shot.

09:15.230 --> 09:17.030
Not for nothing, but
that's the job description.

09:17.032 --> 09:18.731
You prefer we don't
show up at all?

09:18.733 --> 09:20.333
It's not an accusation,
Detective.

09:20.335 --> 09:21.801
It's reality.

09:21.803 --> 09:23.837
I grew up in a neighborhood
like this. I made it out.

09:23.839 --> 09:25.071
Exactly.

09:25.073 --> 09:28.842
Those kids in there--
I can't save all of them

09:28.844 --> 09:30.510
or even
most of them.

09:30.512 --> 09:33.580
But every year I spot one or two
like you, Detective.

09:33.582 --> 09:35.315
Kids I can help.

09:35.317 --> 09:37.283
Kids who want a shot
at a decent life.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.118
Well, we can't change
this neighborhood.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.287
And we're here
to arrest JoJo Reese

09:41.289 --> 09:42.655
and to show
these other students

09:42.657 --> 09:45.325
that gang violence won't be
tolerated in this school.

09:45.327 --> 09:47.327
But we need
your help to do that.

09:47.329 --> 09:51.698
I'll see what I can do.

10:01.609 --> 10:03.810
Hey.

10:04.645 --> 10:07.447
I came as soon as
I got your message.

10:07.449 --> 10:09.849
Is everything okay?

10:09.851 --> 10:13.186
We just got a call from
our Rackets Bureau, Mickey.

10:13.188 --> 10:15.688
And what does that
have to do with me?

10:15.690 --> 10:19.926
Ever hear of a high-end gambling
outfit called MaxMoneyDown?

10:24.732 --> 10:27.200
Well, it seems that you have.

10:27.202 --> 10:30.436
They take major sports
bets and use mob muscle

10:30.438 --> 10:33.139
on their clients who get
in over their heads.

10:33.141 --> 10:36.142
Why didn't you tell me
that you represent

10:36.144 --> 10:37.677
a known gambling syndicate?

10:37.679 --> 10:41.714
I-I didn't want to drag James's
reputation through the mud.

10:41.716 --> 10:43.283
MaxMoneyDown
was his client?

10:43.285 --> 10:45.385
I begged him to drop them.

10:45.387 --> 10:48.821
I mean, they're
really bad guys.

10:48.823 --> 10:51.257
But he couldn't.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.424
So, he repped these guys
to cover his gambling debt.

10:53.448 --> 10:54.061
Yeah.

10:54.062 --> 10:56.796
Were any of the other attorneys
in the firm

10:56.798 --> 10:58.665
involved with MaxMoneyDown?

10:58.667 --> 11:00.900
Y-Yeah. I-I think so.

11:00.902 --> 11:02.936
This is serious, Mickey.

11:02.938 --> 11:05.505
You need to tell me the truth.

11:05.507 --> 11:06.639
Were you making bets, too?

11:06.641 --> 11:08.474
Absolutely not.

11:10.411 --> 11:13.179
So, what happens now?

11:13.181 --> 11:16.049
I'm gonna take down
the gambling syndicate,

11:16.051 --> 11:18.418
even if I have to take a chain
saw to your firm to do it.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.153
And what am I
supposed to do?

11:20.155 --> 11:22.655
Tell the truth.
You'll be fine.

11:28.128 --> 11:29.395
Police. Come on,
get out of the way.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.597
Step aside.

11:31.465 --> 11:33.666
What's going on?

11:33.668 --> 11:35.268
This one lay in wait.

11:35.270 --> 11:36.970
Gave the victim
a hell of a beating.

11:36.972 --> 11:38.104
Where's the other student?

11:38.106 --> 11:41.574
Over there,
but it's not a student.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.643
Ms. Chavez?

11:43.645 --> 11:45.178
You beat the hell
out of your teacher?

11:45.180 --> 11:46.779
Why am I not surprised?

11:46.781 --> 11:49.349
Keep her right here.

11:53.220 --> 11:54.387
Hang in there, Anna.

11:54.389 --> 11:56.122
You're gonna be okay.

11:56.124 --> 11:58.324
Stay with her.
- Yeah.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.463
How the hell does
this happen to her?

12:03.465 --> 12:05.131
She was getting
back to her office

12:05.133 --> 12:06.566
when she was jumped
from behind.

12:06.568 --> 12:08.668
At least we got the kid
who did it.

12:08.670 --> 12:10.670
It's my fault.

12:10.672 --> 12:12.171
This is not your fault.

12:12.173 --> 12:14.841
I'm responsible
for the safety of my staff.

12:14.843 --> 12:18.244
And there's nothing
you could have done about this.

12:18.246 --> 12:22.048
Then why am I here?

12:41.285 --> 12:42.685
How you doing, Ms. Chavez?

12:42.687 --> 12:44.987
Like the Yankees used my head
for batting practice.

12:44.989 --> 12:47.690
- Do you remember what happened?
- Yeah.

12:47.692 --> 12:51.160
I listened to you guys
and wound up in the hospital.

12:51.162 --> 12:52.929
How's that?

12:52.931 --> 12:55.031
After you left, I decided
to talk to my class

12:55.033 --> 12:57.500
about cooperating
with your investigation.

12:57.502 --> 12:59.802
Which took a lot of guts
on your part.

12:59.804 --> 13:02.505
As it turns out,
not a lot of brains.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.607
Did any of the students come
forward with any information?

13:04.609 --> 13:07.443
Two kids signed up
to see me after school.

13:07.445 --> 13:09.679
And you think they were gonna
come clean about the shooting?

13:09.681 --> 13:12.949
I was heading to my office
when I got attacked from behind.

13:12.951 --> 13:14.851
We have Teresa Jones in custody.

13:14.853 --> 13:16.786
All we need from you
is to identify her

13:16.788 --> 13:20.356
as your assailant and we can
take the rest from there.

13:21.558 --> 13:23.493
I can't do that.

13:23.495 --> 13:27.296
Are you saying you don't
remember or you didn't see her?

13:27.298 --> 13:29.332
I'm saying I know
what will happen

13:29.334 --> 13:31.300
if Teresa goes
into the system.

13:31.302 --> 13:33.569
But you didn't have
any problem helping us

13:33.571 --> 13:34.904
put JoJo Reese
into the system.

13:34.906 --> 13:38.808
Prison may be the only thing
that can save JoJo.

13:38.810 --> 13:41.110
But Teresa's different.
She's a good kid.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.112
She's a good kid
who could've killed you.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.747
You don't think she should
pay the price for that?

13:44.749 --> 13:49.118
I'm a teacher, Detective.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.688
Retribution is
your department.

14:01.665 --> 14:03.433
What's up?

14:03.435 --> 14:05.535
I've been going over the
books, uh, for Cochran, Morrow

14:05.537 --> 14:07.303
with Forensic Accounting.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.771
Anything unusual?

14:08.773 --> 14:11.908
We verified every
account except one

14:11.910 --> 14:14.410
in the client portfolio
of the victim.

14:14.412 --> 14:16.179
And?

14:16.181 --> 14:17.947
Rapid cash flow.

14:17.949 --> 14:20.149
Big money, wire transfers
from all over the world.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.417
Who's the client?

14:21.419 --> 14:23.219
See, that's the thing.

14:23.221 --> 14:25.855
It's listed as a personal
account for James Morrow.

14:25.857 --> 14:27.270
Well, he doesn't have
that kind of money.

14:27.294 --> 14:28.058
No.

14:28.059 --> 14:30.893
So I had the FBI run
the wire transfers

14:30.895 --> 14:32.562
against their database.

14:32.564 --> 14:36.599
Several matched transfers linked
to a certain gambling syndicate.

14:36.601 --> 14:37.900
MaxMoneyDown.

14:37.902 --> 14:39.435
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.604
It's like a gambling thing.

14:41.606 --> 14:43.673
How much money is going
through that account?

14:43.675 --> 14:49.378
Close to 30 million bucks
last year alone.

14:52.449 --> 14:54.717
So, we're not talking
about a few lawyers

14:54.719 --> 14:56.252
betting on football games.

14:56.254 --> 14:58.588
Cochran, Morrow is laundering
money for MaxMoneyDown.

14:58.590 --> 15:00.623
I'd say that's
a pretty good bet.

15:00.625 --> 15:04.594
I want Mickey Rodansky
in this office now.

15:04.596 --> 15:06.128
You got it.

15:08.999 --> 15:10.132
You got visitors.

15:10.134 --> 15:12.935
Get on your feet.

15:12.937 --> 15:15.104
Come on.

15:15.106 --> 15:17.306
Let's go. Over here.

15:17.308 --> 15:19.041
What's the problem,
Teresa? You look unhappy.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.910
You don't like
your accommodations?

15:20.912 --> 15:23.880
That woman... she-she
just went to the bathroom

15:23.882 --> 15:24.847
right on the floor.

15:24.849 --> 15:26.582
- Mm.
- Yeah, she's a regular here.

15:26.584 --> 15:27.917
- Mm-hmm.
- It's like her second home.

15:27.919 --> 15:29.752
That's right. Just wait till
you get to Rikers Island.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.521
Got a whole
prison high school

15:31.523 --> 15:33.155
full of honor students
just like you.

15:33.157 --> 15:34.524
I know I messed up.

15:34.526 --> 15:35.992
You think?

15:35.994 --> 15:37.260
What was your beef
with Ms. Chavez?

15:37.262 --> 15:38.494
I love Ms. Chavez.

15:38.496 --> 15:40.463
She's the only teacher
that ever tried to help me.

15:40.465 --> 15:42.064
You love Ms. Chavez?
Yes.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.599
You got a real funny way
of showing it.

15:43.601 --> 15:46.135
I didn't want to hurt her, okay?

15:46.137 --> 15:48.237
I had no choice.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.906
What are you talking about,
you had no choice?

15:49.908 --> 15:53.009
It was part of initiation.

15:53.011 --> 15:54.911
A gang initiation?

15:56.346 --> 15:58.648
What the hell are you doing
getting mixed up with gangs?

15:58.650 --> 16:01.551
Look, when they recruit you,
it's either you join

16:01.553 --> 16:02.952
or they come after you.

16:02.954 --> 16:05.221
But after seeing

16:05.223 --> 16:08.457
Ms. Chavez on the floor,
bleeding...

16:08.459 --> 16:12.028
I wished I had taken
the beating myself.

16:19.736 --> 16:21.304
What the hell is
going on, Erin?

16:21.306 --> 16:23.439
Sit down.

16:27.311 --> 16:29.412
You have the right
to an attorney.

16:29.414 --> 16:31.347
Why would I need
an attorney?

16:31.349 --> 16:33.783
Because you're looking at
multiple felonies here, Mickey.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.718
Could we just, uh,
slow down a second?

16:35.720 --> 16:37.887
I mean, I-I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:37.889 --> 16:40.957
Your firm was laundering cash
for MaxMoneyDown.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.859
Which constitutes as
enterprise corruption.

16:43.861 --> 16:47.096
Now, I asked you if you were
involved in illegal gambling

16:47.098 --> 16:49.031
and you lied
to my face, Mickey.

16:49.033 --> 16:50.333
No, that-that's
not true.

16:50.335 --> 16:52.001
You asked me if I
was placing bets.

16:52.003 --> 16:53.703
I've never placed a bet
on a game in my life.

16:53.705 --> 16:54.704
No, you just launder money

16:54.706 --> 16:56.238
for mobbed-up
gambling rings.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.239
H-H-Here's the thing.

16:57.241 --> 16:59.675
I-I didn't, um,
I didn't know

16:59.677 --> 17:01.177
that they were
laundering money

17:01.179 --> 17:02.345
when I took the job.

17:02.347 --> 17:04.512
Morrow didn't just
represent MaxMoneyDown.

17:04.515 --> 17:06.348
He was part of
their operation.

17:06.351 --> 17:08.384
He didn't want to be. I mean,
he was in over his head.

17:08.386 --> 17:10.118
And he needed just someone

17:10.121 --> 17:12.688
who knew how to move
the money around.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.557
I swear I didn't know anything
about MaxMoneyDown

17:14.559 --> 17:15.657
when I took the job.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.127
But when you found out,
you still played ball.

17:18.128 --> 17:19.895
You could've walked away.

17:19.896 --> 17:22.263
Well, James' life
was in danger.

17:22.266 --> 17:24.800
Come on, you're saying that this
was all about loyalty, Mickey?

17:24.801 --> 17:28.570
Money was part of it.

17:28.573 --> 17:31.240
Okay, I mean, I...

17:31.242 --> 17:34.010
Erin, I was never...
I was never a star here,

17:34.012 --> 17:35.711
not like you.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.916
This was a junior partnership.

17:40.918 --> 17:43.085
Twice what I was making.

17:43.087 --> 17:45.388
And, I mean, I got,
I got three kids

17:45.390 --> 17:46.589
to put through school.

17:46.591 --> 17:47.990
Janice wants to move
to Westchester.

17:47.992 --> 17:51.694
And all of that
could go away.

17:56.801 --> 18:00.436
The only way out

18:00.438 --> 18:03.205
is to testify
against MaxMoneyDown.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.374
I mean, no way.

18:05.376 --> 18:06.776
There's always
Witness Protection.

18:06.778 --> 18:09.945
Janice would leave me.

18:09.947 --> 18:15.184
I... she would
take the kids and...

18:17.954 --> 18:22.558
I'm begging you, please.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.694
Help me.

18:32.869 --> 18:35.071
Why? What's wrong with a roast?

18:35.073 --> 18:36.772
We never have a roast anymore.

18:36.774 --> 18:39.241
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I've got the governor.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.610
Put him on.

18:41.612 --> 18:42.812
On his way up.

18:42.814 --> 18:45.915
I'll call you back, Pop.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.317
And he's here.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.388
We got a problem.

18:54.191 --> 18:55.725
You need something?

18:57.728 --> 18:59.462
Thank you, Baker.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.700
A serious problem.

19:04.702 --> 19:08.571
Why? The grand jury declined
to indict my officer.

19:08.573 --> 19:10.539
It's a joke.
- Anything but.

19:10.541 --> 19:14.143
They concluded that the shooting
was a justified use of force.

19:14.145 --> 19:16.412
Your cop fired
into a crowded bar.

19:16.414 --> 19:19.181
She returned fire,
took out the shooter,

19:19.183 --> 19:20.416
and likely saved lives.

19:20.418 --> 19:22.818
And almost took a life,
one of mine.

19:22.820 --> 19:26.655
Governor, could we turn down
the rhetoric?

19:26.657 --> 19:28.124
It's just us here.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.761
Okay. What are you gonna do?

19:31.763 --> 19:33.929
Well, our internal investigation

19:33.931 --> 19:35.664
supports
the grand jury's decision.

19:35.666 --> 19:36.832
The case is closed.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.734
The hell it is.

19:38.736 --> 19:40.269
I want her gone.

19:40.271 --> 19:42.805
No.

19:42.807 --> 19:43.939
No?

19:43.941 --> 19:46.909
She is a good officer
who did her job well.

19:46.911 --> 19:49.912
She is not going to lose
her shield on my watch.

19:49.914 --> 19:52.648
Since when does nearly
blowing away a civilian

19:52.650 --> 19:53.716
qualify as good?

19:53.718 --> 19:55.351
Governor, police work is messy.

19:55.353 --> 19:58.988
It is dangerous and sometimes
innocent people get shot.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.489
You're lecturing me now?

20:00.491 --> 20:03.125
I shouldn't have to.

20:03.127 --> 20:05.494
I'm sorry your man got shot,

20:05.496 --> 20:07.897
but I will not punish
a good officer

20:07.899 --> 20:10.499
to satisfy your beef
on how this went down.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.171
I bet you were a Boy Scout.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.973
Till I got kicked out.

20:17.975 --> 20:19.475
What for?

20:19.477 --> 20:22.111
I had a problem with authority.

20:23.814 --> 20:25.214
That supposed to be funny?

20:25.216 --> 20:29.018
No. Just true.

20:31.822 --> 20:34.356
Either you fire this cop,

20:34.358 --> 20:35.858
or I will order
the attorney general

20:35.860 --> 20:38.460
to drill down on every
questionable police shooting

20:38.462 --> 20:39.962
in the past ten years.

20:39.964 --> 20:42.331
Which would be your right.

20:42.333 --> 20:46.669
Then hold public hearings,
out loud and lights up.

20:49.339 --> 20:51.807
Everybody loves the circus.

20:51.809 --> 20:55.477
Except the guy that's got
to shovel up afterwards.

21:17.802 --> 21:19.937
I can't thank you
enough for this.

21:19.939 --> 21:21.138
How'd you make it happen?

21:21.140 --> 21:22.573
Just got to know
which cage to rattle.

21:22.575 --> 21:24.942
This won't solve

21:24.944 --> 21:27.411
all of our problems, but it is
a step in the right direction.

21:27.413 --> 21:30.013
Yeah, and hopefully
it'll keep the gang violence

21:30.015 --> 21:32.282
off the school property,
not on it.

21:32.284 --> 21:34.051
Knowing these measures
are in place,

21:34.053 --> 21:37.087
it's gonna make it
easier for me to go.

21:37.089 --> 21:39.156
Go where?
Where you going?

21:39.158 --> 21:42.926
I've decided to step
down as principal.

21:42.928 --> 21:44.428
Wait a minute.

21:44.430 --> 21:45.462
After all this?

21:45.464 --> 21:48.231
What are you talking about?

21:48.233 --> 21:52.169
I've done my best
to make this school better,

21:52.171 --> 21:54.504
but clearly I've failed.

21:54.506 --> 21:55.539
No, you and I both know

21:55.541 --> 21:56.807
the problems
with this school come

21:56.809 --> 21:59.142
from outside those doors,
not inside.

21:59.144 --> 22:01.011
That's not on you.
This is supposed to be a place

22:01.013 --> 22:02.679
where kids can feel safe.

22:02.681 --> 22:03.680
But you're doing
everything you can

22:03.682 --> 22:05.115
to make 'em feel safe now.

22:05.117 --> 22:06.550
Besides, you said there's
only a few knuckleheads

22:06.552 --> 22:08.518
in the school-- you gonna
let them run you off?

22:08.520 --> 22:11.021
I have done everything
I know how to do

22:11.023 --> 22:12.255
to connect with 'em.

22:12.257 --> 22:13.390
Try harder.

22:13.392 --> 22:15.692
Somebody else's turn.
- Yeah?

22:15.694 --> 22:18.061
Well, not for nothing,
but it sounds to me

22:18.063 --> 22:20.897
like you're just feeling
sorry for yourself.

22:23.001 --> 22:25.902
Maybe, but I've earned it.

22:25.904 --> 22:29.206
I am doing
what I think is right.

22:43.721 --> 22:46.056
You've done
excellent work here, Erin.

22:46.058 --> 22:47.991
We should have more than enough

22:47.993 --> 22:50.460
to take down
the gambling syndicate.

22:50.462 --> 22:52.696
That's a serious scalp.

22:52.698 --> 22:54.231
So what's your
game plan?

22:54.233 --> 22:56.700
I'd like to cut a deal
with Mickey Rodansky.

22:56.702 --> 22:58.368
He can give us
a detailed blueprint

22:58.370 --> 23:01.138
of the entire
money-laundering operation.

23:01.140 --> 23:04.875
Great, he'll make an excellent
star witness for us.

23:04.877 --> 23:07.444
Right.
So, about that.

23:07.446 --> 23:10.781
There are a number of attorneys
privy to this scheme.

23:10.783 --> 23:12.215
So?
- So, I don't think

23:12.217 --> 23:14.618
we need to put Mickey
on the stand.

23:16.354 --> 23:17.954
You're kidding, right?

23:17.956 --> 23:19.523
He is giving us
everything we need--

23:19.525 --> 23:23.393
details of placement, layering,
integration of the dirty cash.

23:23.395 --> 23:24.361
There are a number of lawyers

23:24.363 --> 23:25.996
who can take the stand
and testify.

23:25.998 --> 23:26.997
But none of them created

23:26.999 --> 23:29.966
or managed
the phony accounts, right?

23:31.035 --> 23:33.236
Not directly, no.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.607
I know Mickey Rodansky's
a friend of yours...

23:37.609 --> 23:39.776
Who served this office
faithfully for years.

23:39.778 --> 23:41.545
All the more reason
he needs to testify.

23:41.547 --> 23:44.414
We can't appear to be
protecting one of our own,

23:44.416 --> 23:45.749
especially someone
who has betrayed

23:45.751 --> 23:46.717
everything we stand for.

23:46.719 --> 23:49.953
He made a mistake.
- A damn big one.

23:49.955 --> 23:51.922
So, if he wants to
stay out of prison,

23:51.924 --> 23:55.625
he's gonna take the stand
and sing for his supper.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.527
The pay sucks,

23:57.529 --> 23:58.762
the facilities
are falling apart,

23:58.764 --> 24:00.797
and the students--
the reason most people claim

24:00.799 --> 24:02.733
to become teachers
in the first place--

24:02.735 --> 24:04.735
half of them are
wannabe gangsters,

24:04.737 --> 24:06.837
the other half are
walking around terrified.

24:06.839 --> 24:09.172
Teachers aren't in it
for the pay or the perks.

24:09.174 --> 24:11.608
I get that. I don't get
what the draw is,

24:11.610 --> 24:12.909
that's all I'm saying.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.678
Well, students like me.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.280
You mean hopeless causes?
Hey.

24:17.282 --> 24:20.250
That's your brother,
not a hopeless cause.

24:20.252 --> 24:23.553
More like an exciting challenge.
No, more like Steve Jobs.

24:23.555 --> 24:25.756
You know, where the teachers
don't realize how great I was

24:25.758 --> 24:27.824
until years later.

24:27.826 --> 24:30.961
I don't think your teachers
are gonna wait that long

24:30.963 --> 24:32.295
to do your report card.

24:32.297 --> 24:34.162
But I'll give you an
"A" for creativity.

24:34.186 --> 24:35.266
Yeah.

24:35.267 --> 24:37.000
I thought about being
a teacher for a while.

24:37.002 --> 24:38.268
What?

24:38.270 --> 24:39.903
No, really.

24:39.905 --> 24:41.138
When?

24:41.140 --> 24:42.773
Well, when I was figuring out
what to do with my life.

24:42.775 --> 24:44.040
Oh, so, like,
this morning?

24:44.042 --> 24:47.177
Exactly.
What kind of teacher?

24:47.179 --> 24:48.712
I never got that far,
but it was more the idea

24:48.714 --> 24:50.847
of skipping the part of life
where you accumulate things.

24:50.849 --> 24:52.315
You know, just
fast-forwarding ahead

24:52.317 --> 24:55.018
to giving back,
sharing what you know.

24:55.020 --> 24:56.052
But how do you give back

24:56.054 --> 24:58.255
if you haven't accumulated
anything in life?

24:58.257 --> 24:59.856
You got an instinct
for service, you know,

24:59.858 --> 25:01.324
you find a way to serve.
- You did.

25:01.326 --> 25:02.692
You became a cop.

25:02.694 --> 25:04.628
Pretty big difference between
those two kinds of service.

25:04.630 --> 25:06.696
And what was the pull
of being a teacher?

25:06.698 --> 25:09.566
I think... and
don't laugh...

25:09.568 --> 25:11.268
Ha!

25:12.219 --> 25:13.871
I'm kidding.
Go ahead, come on.

25:13.872 --> 25:16.540
I think I wasn't sure
how much I had to offer,

25:16.542 --> 25:21.011
but if I could inspire
two or three kids a year

25:21.013 --> 25:22.412
to go on and do
something good,

25:22.414 --> 25:23.780
that would be more
of a contribution

25:23.782 --> 25:25.448
than I could make on my own.

25:25.450 --> 25:26.750
You should come speak
at the school I'm working on.

25:26.752 --> 25:28.785
All right, give me a break.
No, I'm serious.

25:28.787 --> 25:30.987
I think those teachers
could use a reminder.

25:30.989 --> 25:33.390
Especially hearing it
like that from you.

25:33.392 --> 25:34.745
And how'd you put it--
what they deal with?

25:34.769 --> 25:35.626
The pay's crap.

25:35.627 --> 25:38.361
Half the population is
wannabe gangsters,

25:38.363 --> 25:39.830
the other half's
walking around terrified.

25:39.832 --> 25:41.998
What's that sound like?

25:43.568 --> 25:45.135
A given day on the beat.

25:45.137 --> 25:48.071
I'm just sayin'.

25:54.812 --> 25:57.948
Well, stay on it,
Garrett.

25:57.950 --> 26:01.151
I'm here.
I ain't going anywhere.

26:04.789 --> 26:07.090
Want two aspirin with that?

26:07.092 --> 26:10.060
Oh, the governor's scheduled
a carnival sideshow

26:10.062 --> 26:12.128
masquerading as
a press conference.

26:12.130 --> 26:13.129
To announce what?

26:13.131 --> 26:16.466
An investigation
by the attorney general

26:16.468 --> 26:18.768
into NYPD shootings.

26:18.770 --> 26:19.870
Based on?

26:19.872 --> 26:22.439
Based on nothing.
It's a scavenger hunt.

26:22.441 --> 26:24.975
Because a grand jury
declined to indict

26:24.977 --> 26:27.310
in his aide's shooting.

26:27.312 --> 26:30.814
He's not one to let facts
get in the way.

26:30.816 --> 26:32.749
So what are you gonna do?

26:32.751 --> 26:34.718
Nothing I can do.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.454
That's the plan?
Do nothing?

26:39.457 --> 26:43.159
I didn't say that.
I said there's nothing <i>I</i> can do.

26:43.161 --> 26:45.962
It's the same lame thing, Dad.

26:45.964 --> 26:48.298
No, it's not.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.034
There's a solution.

26:51.036 --> 26:53.837
You just haven't worked
hard enough to find it.

26:53.839 --> 26:57.340
I hate it when you
quote me to me.

26:57.342 --> 27:01.444
Oh, but it's really good advice.

27:08.119 --> 27:10.253
That's what happens
at schools like

27:10.255 --> 27:12.122
Carnegie Hill, Danny,
teachers burn out.

27:12.124 --> 27:13.456
I know, but what
about the good kids

27:13.458 --> 27:14.524
who get left behind?

27:14.526 --> 27:15.825
They figure out
a way to get by.

27:15.827 --> 27:18.228
In that neighborhood, with
schools going down the tubes?

27:18.230 --> 27:19.696
Come on, it ain't right.

27:19.698 --> 27:21.097
Right's the last thing it is.

27:21.099 --> 27:24.834
Reagan. Yeah?

27:24.836 --> 27:26.670
You got to be kidding me.

27:26.672 --> 27:29.105
We just-- we're on our way.

27:29.107 --> 27:30.173
We got to go.

27:30.175 --> 27:31.641
-Where?
- Back to Carnegie Hill.

27:31.643 --> 27:33.763
There's an armed hostage
situation at the high school.

27:41.304 --> 27:42.471
Go, go, go!

28:08.887 --> 28:11.122
Go, go, go!

28:32.344 --> 28:34.946
Hang on, Chief.
Hey, what do we got?

28:34.948 --> 28:37.081
Suspect entered a special ed
class with a handgun.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.517
- Anyone shot?
- Not yet.

28:39.519 --> 28:42.920
- He's got 25 students in there.
- Yeah, we know the class.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.055
There's a banger in there,
JoJo Reese,

28:44.057 --> 28:45.690
we like for a previous
shooting on campus.

28:45.692 --> 28:47.058
Could be our perp.
It's not Reese.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.561
HNT has already established
a dialogue with the suspect.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.930
- Who is it?
- The name's Darryl Ward.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.365
The principal Darryl Ward?

28:54.367 --> 28:58.369
HNT tried to talk him out,
but he won't budge.

28:58.371 --> 29:00.838
He released a teacher,
but now he's hunkered down.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.507
Let me talk to him.

29:02.509 --> 29:05.243
What are you gonna say
that a negotiator didn't?

29:05.245 --> 29:06.577
Look, I know the man,
I can get through to him

29:06.579 --> 29:08.079
if you just give me
a chance to speak with him.

29:08.081 --> 29:10.014
Please.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.749
Tina.

29:24.062 --> 29:25.963
I told you I have
nothing else to say.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.431
Darryl,
it's Detective Reagan.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.033
What the hell are you
doing in there?

29:29.035 --> 29:30.935
I'm doing what you said,
Detective.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.104
I never said to do this.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.272
You told me it was my job
to find a way

29:34.274 --> 29:35.406
to get through to these kids.

29:35.408 --> 29:37.775
But not by holding them
hostage at gunpoint.

29:37.777 --> 29:41.345
No, by speaking in the language
that they understand best...

29:41.347 --> 29:42.780
violence.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.749
Hello?
He hung up.

29:44.751 --> 29:48.319
ESU has a sniper team
in position with a clean shot.

29:48.321 --> 29:49.754
You're just gonna take him out?

29:49.756 --> 29:51.022
I'm sure as hell
not going to wait for him

29:51.024 --> 29:53.257
to start killing
those kids in there.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.625
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Just give me a chance

29:54.627 --> 29:56.260
to go in and talk to him.
No, no, no, no. No way.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.362
Come on, I know this man.
He's a good man.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.765
He's just turned around
sideways.

30:00.767 --> 30:02.800
I'm telling you I can
get him to stand down

30:02.802 --> 30:05.570
if you just give me
a second with him, please.

30:05.572 --> 30:06.671
You've got five minutes.

30:06.673 --> 30:08.906
Ward makes a move
while you're inside,

30:08.908 --> 30:10.808
I give the order.
- Fine.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.710
Give me a vest.

30:21.753 --> 30:24.422
I did everything
I could, Mickey.

30:24.424 --> 30:27.124
I know you did, Erin.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.994
Monica feels our strongest case
against MaxMoneyDown

30:29.996 --> 30:32.029
features you
as the lead witness.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.699
She never was
a very big fan.

30:34.701 --> 30:36.968
Well, it's not
personal, Mickey.

30:36.970 --> 30:38.202
When your life's
on the line,

30:38.204 --> 30:41.005
it's very personal.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.974
Well, you put your own life
on the line.

30:42.976 --> 30:44.609
You're right.

30:44.611 --> 30:47.879
I mean, this is, this is on me.

30:47.881 --> 30:48.946
So what happens now?

30:48.948 --> 30:52.817
We take you into custody,
keep you safe.

30:52.819 --> 30:54.185
After you testify,

30:54.187 --> 30:58.756
Witness Protection.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.893
I need to tell
Janice and the kids.

31:01.895 --> 31:03.461
I'll drive you over there.

31:03.463 --> 31:04.662
You know, if you don't mind,

31:04.664 --> 31:06.297
I mean, I--
I would rather go myself.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.633
I mean, I-- I'd rather
them not see me in custody.

31:08.635 --> 31:10.001
At least not yet.

31:34.259 --> 31:36.460
I got to be nuts.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.535
Darryl Ward,

31:44.537 --> 31:46.704
it's Detective Reagan.

31:46.706 --> 31:47.705
Go away, Detective.

31:47.707 --> 31:48.973
Hey, I'm not
going anywhere.

31:48.975 --> 31:51.075
I'm the only friend
you got right now.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.550
We need to talk, okay?
I'm just gonna step in...

31:52.574 --> 31:53.979
Don't.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.314
Okay.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.317
Everyone okay in there?

31:59.319 --> 32:00.685
Man, hell no.
This dude is crazy.

32:00.687 --> 32:02.453
Shut up, JoJo.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.323
How'd you get that gun

32:05.325 --> 32:08.492
past the metal
detectors, Mr. Ward?

32:08.494 --> 32:11.562
I brought it the day before
they-they were activated.

32:14.232 --> 32:18.002
You know there's still a
way out of this, right?

32:18.004 --> 32:19.870
Nobody's hurt.

32:19.872 --> 32:22.573
Put that gun down, we all
get to go home in one piece.

32:22.575 --> 32:25.343
But nothing changes.

32:25.345 --> 32:28.946
Is this the kind of change
you really want?

32:28.948 --> 32:31.916
Huh? Look at me.

32:31.918 --> 32:35.987
There is an ESU sniper
outside that window.

32:35.989 --> 32:37.355
Roger, Captain.

32:37.357 --> 32:39.290
<i>And he has orders</i>
<i>to take you out if he has to,</i>

32:39.292 --> 32:41.692
<i>and you better believe me,</i>
<i>he will.</i>

32:41.694 --> 32:43.527
Come on.

32:43.529 --> 32:44.862
I'm not afraid to die.

32:44.864 --> 32:46.964
What about you, Mr. Reese?

32:46.966 --> 32:48.899
Huh?

32:48.901 --> 32:51.402
Step up here. Now.

32:57.275 --> 32:58.776
Come on, don't do
nothing stupid.

32:58.778 --> 33:01.178
It's a little different on the
other side of the gun, huh?

33:03.815 --> 33:05.683
You just gonna let him kill me?

33:05.685 --> 33:06.851
Darryl, you
raise that gun,

33:06.853 --> 33:08.486
you're as good as dead,
you know that.

33:08.488 --> 33:13.324
I am willing to die
to save this school.

33:13.326 --> 33:15.726
Are you willing to die
to destroy it?

33:15.728 --> 33:17.795
Darryl, you die here today,
what does it prove?

33:17.797 --> 33:19.363
It'll certainly
call attention

33:19.365 --> 33:22.366
to what we have to go
through on a daily basis.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.603
This ain't the kind
of attention you want.

33:25.605 --> 33:29.040
Remember who you
are, Mr. Ward.

33:29.042 --> 33:30.908
You raise that gun,

33:30.910 --> 33:34.111
you only bring more violence
down on this school.

33:50.062 --> 33:52.830
All I wanted to do...

33:53.865 --> 33:56.767
...was make a difference.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.109
You just did.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.083
Where's Mickey Rodansky?

34:12.085 --> 34:13.951
He was supposed to be here
two hours ago.

34:13.953 --> 34:16.853
Keep me updated, Anthony.
I spoke to his wife.

34:16.856 --> 34:18.556
She said he was coming
straight back here.

34:18.558 --> 34:20.123
Well, unless he was
riding a tricycle,

34:20.126 --> 34:22.092
I would say now he's
officially in the wind.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.494
Mickey would not flee.

34:23.496 --> 34:26.563
Why not?
The guy was about to testify

34:26.565 --> 34:28.065
against a violent
gambling syndicate.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.766
Sounds like a pretty good
reason to me.

34:29.768 --> 34:30.835
Monica...

34:30.837 --> 34:31.936
You allowed a key witness

34:31.938 --> 34:33.337
to leave this office
unsupervised.

34:33.339 --> 34:34.538
What the hell were you thinking?

34:34.540 --> 34:36.940
I know Mickey.

34:36.943 --> 34:38.641
I felt that I could trust him.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.143
In other words,

34:40.146 --> 34:42.847
you allowed your personal
relationship with the witness

34:42.849 --> 34:45.850
to cloud your
professional judgment.

34:45.851 --> 34:49.887
I should have sent Anthony
with him. I'm sorry.

34:49.889 --> 34:53.157
I'd accept an apology

34:53.159 --> 34:55.159
if I was sure
it was an accident.

34:55.161 --> 34:58.662
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

34:58.664 --> 35:02.199
It means I'm not sure you didn't
intentionally provide Rodansky

35:02.201 --> 35:03.934
with the opportunity to flee.

35:03.936 --> 35:07.071
I didn't and I wouldn't.

35:07.073 --> 35:08.806
Then do your job.

35:08.808 --> 35:10.708
Secure a Material Witness Order

35:10.710 --> 35:14.178
and get Rodansky's ass
into protective custody.

35:20.986 --> 35:23.854
You think Principal Ward
will do time?

35:23.856 --> 35:25.823
Kidnapping,
unlawful imprisonment,

35:25.825 --> 35:27.024
gun possession.

35:27.026 --> 35:28.592
Even with a clean
record like him,

35:28.594 --> 35:29.793
he's looking
at state time.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.829
You took a hell of a risk
going in there.

35:31.831 --> 35:33.664
Hey, Mr. Ward took
a hell of a risk

35:33.666 --> 35:35.799
going there every
single day.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.768
Ms. Chavez,
you doing okay?

35:37.770 --> 35:39.036
I'm walking and breathing.

35:39.038 --> 35:40.337
It's a start.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.672
What can we help you with?

35:41.674 --> 35:43.007
You already did.
- Hmm?

35:43.009 --> 35:45.442
Thank you for putting in
a good word for Teresa.

35:45.444 --> 35:48.479
She does her community service,
keeps her nose clean,

35:48.481 --> 35:50.114
the assault won't go
on her record.

35:50.116 --> 35:51.582
She owes her future to you guys.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.350
She owes her future to you.

35:53.352 --> 35:54.852
You're the one
that believed in her.

35:54.854 --> 35:56.921
What will you do now?

35:56.923 --> 35:59.390
Finish my lesson plans
and get back to work on Monday.

35:59.392 --> 36:03.093
You're going back
to Carnegie Hill?

36:03.095 --> 36:05.162
What can I say? I'm a masochist.

36:05.164 --> 36:08.365
And I've decided to take
the principal's exam.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.534
Someone's got to finish
what Principal Ward started.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.137
Well, our money's on you.

36:13.139 --> 36:14.805
Smart bet.

36:24.082 --> 36:25.783
I'm sorry to interrupt.

36:28.220 --> 36:31.622
Could the governor and I
have a moment?

36:32.991 --> 36:35.192
Yeah.

36:36.461 --> 36:38.495
Much appreciated.

36:44.302 --> 36:45.703
You want to
order something?

36:45.705 --> 36:46.637
I'm good.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.739
The appetizers here
are top-notch.

36:48.741 --> 36:51.342
Not hungry.
Thanks, though.

36:51.344 --> 36:53.744
Are you one of these guys

36:53.746 --> 36:55.579
that like to deliver
bad news in person?

36:55.581 --> 36:57.781
I don't have bad news.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.327
You dump the cop
that shot my guy?

36:59.351 --> 37:00.418
No.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.152
Bad news.

37:02.154 --> 37:04.922
Depends on what
you compare it to.

37:04.924 --> 37:06.657
What's that mean?

37:06.659 --> 37:08.826
Means everything's relative.

37:08.828 --> 37:10.694
See, it turns out
that Lawrence Cobb

37:10.696 --> 37:14.131
wasn't drinking alone
the night he was shot.

37:14.133 --> 37:15.933
So? He's a single guy.
God bless.

37:15.935 --> 37:17.501
He was with a married woman.

37:17.503 --> 37:21.805
That's on her, not on him.

37:23.341 --> 37:26.677
Except she is married
to his boss,

37:26.679 --> 37:28.912
your chief of staff.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.788
Sheesh.

37:39.658 --> 37:42.693
Turns out it's been going on
for over a year.

37:42.695 --> 37:45.529
Too bad the shot
missed Cobb's nuts.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.798
Now that would've been justice.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.804
So what are we doing?

37:53.806 --> 37:57.574
This gets out,
the circus comes to Albany.

37:57.576 --> 37:58.742
Don't you think?

37:58.744 --> 38:00.577
Who else knows?

38:00.579 --> 38:05.182
Right now, it is safe in the
notebook of my lead detective.

38:05.184 --> 38:07.985
Whether or not it finds
its way into a DD5,

38:07.987 --> 38:12.022
subject to a Freedom
of Information request,

38:12.024 --> 38:14.058
that's a judgment call.

38:14.060 --> 38:16.193
Your judgment?

38:18.663 --> 38:20.864
Yes.

38:23.601 --> 38:26.203
And if my investigation
goes away?

38:28.373 --> 38:32.076
Neither of us is shoveling up
after the circus.

38:32.078 --> 38:34.411
I have your word on that?

38:34.413 --> 38:36.080
Yes.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.116
We're done here?

38:39.951 --> 38:42.386
Yes.

38:44.189 --> 38:47.224
You have a good evening,
Commissioner.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.295
You, too, Governor.

39:02.575 --> 39:04.475
I got your text.

39:04.477 --> 39:06.143
You find Mickey?
- Yeah.

39:06.145 --> 39:07.277
Where the hell is he?

39:07.279 --> 39:09.713
Patrol found him
20 minutes ago.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.315
Maybe you shouldn't
go over there.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.919
What the hell happened?

39:15.921 --> 39:17.221
Can't be sure,

39:17.223 --> 39:20.190
but I'm guessing MaxMoneyDown
decided to take him out

39:20.192 --> 39:22.126
before he could testify.

39:29.968 --> 39:31.969
Oh...

39:33.304 --> 39:35.406
This is my fault.

39:35.408 --> 39:38.275
He made his bed.
Even he knew that.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.615
Sorry about your friend.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.721
Oh...
