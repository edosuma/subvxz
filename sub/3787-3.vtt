Earl, I noticed
you're still alive.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.605
What's your secret?

00:06.607 --> 00:08.841
Well, it's my positive
attitude,

00:08.843 --> 00:10.209
a little bit of genetics,

00:10.211 --> 00:13.112
and knowing how to take care
of your body.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.214
I use jojoba.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.316
What is that, like a lotion?

00:17.318 --> 00:21.120
No, it's a ho named hoba.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.789

Max, you just got box delivered
at home.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.637
I don't want another box.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.639
I got my hands full
with this one.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.909
I used to have so many packages
delivered to my house,

00:43.911 --> 00:47.146
my dad had to buy fedex
just to save money.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.115
I remember a time before mail.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.184
You just didn't get stuff.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.919
Nope.
I don't want that.

00:53.921 --> 00:55.621
It's a delivery from my mother.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.489
The last thing she delivered
was me,

00:57.491 --> 00:59.324
and I'm still cleaning up
that mess.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.362
Aren't you at least curious
what she sent?

01:03.364 --> 01:04.863
Unless it's a brand new
childhood,

01:04.865 --> 01:07.332
I'm not interested.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.201
Here, Earl, hold Max's box.

01:09.203 --> 01:13.105
But she's like a daughter
to me.

01:14.541 --> 01:16.675
Look, Caroline,
I brought in my fish tank,

01:16.677 --> 01:20.779
which Max has been calling
my olympic-size swimming pool.

01:23.316 --> 01:26.518
See, han? The world's different
above sea-level.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.893
Now, come over here
and say hello.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.528
I'm saying hello to fish now?

01:36.530 --> 01:38.063
That's where I'm at?

01:38.065 --> 01:39.431
You too, Max.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.567
I want my diner family
to meet my fish family.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.235
I got an aunt that drinks
like a fish.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.970
Maybe she's in there.

01:44.972 --> 01:49.374
Oh, no, she's in jail
for vehicular manslaughter.

Never tap on the glass!

01:56.450 --> 01:58.383
Just look at that meaty paw
of yours.

01:58.385 --> 02:01.687
It's like an earthquake
to them.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.921
Oh, there's my prize.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.790
The royal blue tang fish.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.592
$500.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.861
Han, I'm not surprised
you have to pay for blue tang,

02:08.863 --> 02:12.131
but $500 seems high.

02:12.133 --> 02:16.368
Hey han,
jojoba'll do it for 25.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.670

will be very happy here.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.459
I'm breaking up
with all my ladies

02:40.461 --> 02:41.827
so I can start up again
with Sophie.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.596
And oksana's not taking
it lying down,

02:44.598 --> 02:48.767
or bent over
like she usually is.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.970
Well, I'm sorry
I never got to meet her.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.740
Just tell her that you
and Sophie have decided to be--

02:54.742 --> 02:56.775
what's the Ukrainian word
for "monogamy"?

02:56.777 --> 02:58.443
There isn't one.

You're either ugly or
you're sleeping with everyone.

No way.

don't you wanna know

I used to have room service.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.741
Oh, my god,
I used to have a room.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.910
Well, I don't want
it in the apartment.

Oh, my god.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.839
She kept that?

04:00.841 --> 04:02.507
How did my mom ever keep that?

04:02.509 --> 04:05.611
She can't even keep her teeth.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.878
That's what was in the box?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.747
A Teddy ruxpin doll?

04:08.749 --> 04:12.117
Are you registered
at mustybears.Com?

04:12.119 --> 04:14.119
Not a doll and not his name.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.762

You know, in Poland,
we didn't have dolls.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.705
Yeah, we just hired
little gypsy kids

04:33.707 --> 04:36.708
and we carried them around.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.578
Yeah, mine was called gurgio.

04:39.580 --> 04:43.548
Yeah, and I think uh,
he had a little bit of polio.

04:46.686 --> 04:48.287
Hey, didn't those things talk?

04:48.289 --> 04:50.656

four "c" batteries.

with this adorable Teddy Bear

it till I heard that.

get to think this Bear

for my childhood.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.859
She doesn't get off that easy.

09:20.861 --> 09:24.095

couch for nine months.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.197

can I see you over here?

09:26.199 --> 09:28.400

to talk to the fish again.

put han in the tank yet.

from now on,

09:47.921 --> 09:50.855
Well, we'll just call
it an elderberry.

09:53.926 --> 09:57.329
Well, Caroline, Max said no,
so you have to do it.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.764
Han, you're kind of a baller
around your fish.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.299
All right, I'm gonna do this
fast.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.901
Get in and get out--

10:02.903 --> 10:04.836
same thing I do when
that bird is in our shower.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.972
[Bell dings]
Pick up, Max.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.641

I met somebody else

10:09.643 --> 10:11.242
so I'm breaking up with you.

10:11.244 --> 10:14.245
Now put your mother on.
I'm breaking up with her too.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.619
I can't believe this.

10:20.621 --> 10:24.189
I'm a cabana boy for fish.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.358

"fish poop remover"

10:26.360 --> 10:31.496
to my resume
next to "supreme court intern."

10:31.498 --> 10:35.400
I feel like there was a fish
in that last one.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.835
Yup.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.137
Oh, no, it's the expensive one!

10:39.139 --> 10:41.539
That's so me.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.475

you digging through garbage

10:43.477 --> 10:45.910
till you were 30.

Oh! Ah! Ugh!
It's still alive!

10:48.782 --> 10:50.582
I need to keep her wet.

10:50.584 --> 10:53.818
Oh, covered in tuna, that's
gotta be traumatic for it.

10:59.091 --> 11:02.027
I feel like it went down
the drain.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.562
It was an accident.
I swear.

11:04.564 --> 11:07.032
I love fish.
I would never hurt one.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.667
Unless you count eating Sushi,
'cause then I'm like

11:08.669 --> 11:10.235
Jack the ripper.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.537
Caroline, are things
going swimmingly?

11:12.539 --> 11:14.572
Jack, he's talking to you.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.841
Uh, oh, yeah.
Swimmingly.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.510
Especially the blue one.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.178
He went in his little house.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.413
He doesn't like
to use the restroom

11:21.415 --> 11:23.415
in front of his friends.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.884
Yeah, we're a lot alike.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.091
Thank you so much
for seeing us so quickly.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.293
Sure, you guys can just
wait in here.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.630
Elliot's finishing up
with his pilates.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.432
Do yourselves a favor.

11:40.434 --> 11:43.301
Tell him his core looks tight.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.941
Max, I'm so sorry
you have to sell t-rux

11:49.943 --> 11:52.577
for the fish money
because of me.

11:52.579 --> 11:56.081
Talked to the fist,
because the face is pissed.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.582
I'm getting attitude
from a Bear?

11:57.584 --> 12:00.452
That's where I'm at?

12:00.454 --> 12:02.987
I can't believe all this stuff
he has from the '90s.

12:02.989 --> 12:07.325
I can't believe he has to have
a party to come out.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.194
That kid came out, out.

12:09.196 --> 12:13.431
His umbilical cord
is a Gucci belt.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.934
Oh...These toys!

12:15.936 --> 12:18.169
This is like looking back
at my childhood

12:18.171 --> 12:21.539
but, you know, a time before
rainbows became political.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.607
[Gasps]

12:22.609 --> 12:23.608
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.543
Oh, my god.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.345
A my size Barbie!

12:27.347 --> 12:28.446
I had ten of these.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.281
Not to play with,
they were used as decoys

12:30.283 --> 12:32.450
in case of a hostage
situation.

12:32.452 --> 12:37.021
And now your whole life's
a hostage situation.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.356
Sorry I'm late.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.225
My trainer, Gary,
and I got derailed

12:40.227 --> 12:42.393
talking about<i> the real</i>
<i>housewives of orange county.</i>

12:42.395 --> 12:43.828
Your core looks really good.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.097
I know, honey.

12:46.099 --> 12:50.935
Now while I get my check book,
say hello to the olsens.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.504
You got a lot of toys.

12:52.506 --> 12:56.274
When I was a girl your age,
I only had this.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.876
I don't suppose I could play
with my size Barbie

12:57.878 --> 13:00.044
for a second.

13:00.046 --> 13:02.380
I feel like that's
a "no, bitch."

13:02.382 --> 13:04.949
I'm not--I'm not just talking
about the toys.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.152
You got a pretty sweet set-up.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.654
That nice lady out there,
giving you everything you want,

13:09.656 --> 13:11.055
taking care of you.

13:11.057 --> 13:14.359
She's just a mom.
Everyone has one.

13:14.361 --> 13:19.631
Not really. Some people
just have bad ass bears.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.466
Max,
are you sure about this?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.935
This is the only thing you have
from your childhood.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.670
Not true, I have a dent
in my skull

13:25.672 --> 13:28.940
from a ball-peen hammer.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.875
The last time I change
the channel

13:30.877 --> 13:33.878
during<i> three's company.</i>

13:33.880 --> 13:36.514
Can we fast forward this
to me having the Bear

13:36.516 --> 13:38.116
and you two leaving?

13:38.118 --> 13:39.818
Okay, just take it,
it doesn't matter.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.686
No, Max.
It does matter.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.687
We're not selling this.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.289
He has enough toys.

13:44.291 --> 13:47.025
I mean, all I wanted to do
was touch the life-size Barbie.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.560
Okay, I see what's happening.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.995
I've been down this road
with the beanie babies.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.430
I'll give you 600 for the Bear.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.364
Sold.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.566
No, Max!
That's your childhood.

13:54.568 --> 13:55.600
700.
- Sold!

13:55.602 --> 13:56.935
No, Max!

13:56.937 --> 13:59.637
Caroline, my childhood
is not worth $700.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.706
The most my mother ever got
for me was 40 bucks

14:01.708 --> 14:03.374
and a big gulp.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.144
But that's "little you"
in there, Max.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.812
And she's priceless.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.047
And she's about to erased
and taped over

14:09.049 --> 14:11.249
by the soundtrack
from<i> frozen.</i>

14:11.251 --> 14:12.283
<i>Frozen?</i>

14:12.285 --> 14:16.187
Who am I?
Me, a year ago?

14:16.189 --> 14:18.256
No.
Can't have her.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.625
Well, what are we gonna do now
about the other child?

14:20.627 --> 14:22.060
The one in the diner?

14:22.062 --> 14:23.995
Well, I guess he's just gonna
have to grow up.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.630
Grow up? You think
if he had that ability,

14:25.632 --> 14:29.801
he wouldn't have used it yet?

14:29.803 --> 14:32.103
So what--
no Bear?

14:32.105 --> 14:34.305
Oh, please!
You'll have a Bear in your life.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.307
Trust me.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.314
All right, Max.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.716
You're gonna help me
tell him, right?

14:44.718 --> 14:46.217
You like giving him
bad news.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.519
No, I like giving him bad news
about how he's short

14:48.521 --> 14:49.520
and has a big head.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.756
You know, fun bad news.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.258
Exciting news!

14:53.260 --> 14:55.193
I got the fishies
a new house!

14:55.195 --> 14:58.997
I got it cheap.
It was a foreclosure.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.132
Uh, han, can we talk to you
over there

15:01.134 --> 15:03.167
in the booth--the far booth?

15:03.169 --> 15:05.470
Can it wait?
I want to put in the new condo

15:05.472 --> 15:09.007
so Max will stop calling me
a slum lord.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.775
Oh, that can wait,
I mean, those fish

15:10.777 --> 15:12.176
aren't going anywhere.

15:12.178 --> 15:13.578
Except for the blue one,
who's definitely playing

15:13.580 --> 15:15.980
some kind of twisted game
of hide and seek.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.515
Oh, yeah, he loves
that little house.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.151
He's going to love
this one even more.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.653
Max, can you join me?

15:21.655 --> 15:26.557
I'm pretty busy waiting
on tables right now.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.892
Okay, what's going on?

15:27.894 --> 15:31.329
Max has never waited
on a table in her life.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.131
Max, I need you over here.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.133
I'm just putting down
this grilled cheese

15:35.135 --> 15:37.035
'cause I don't want
it to get cold.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.071
Now I'm freaking out!

15:40.073 --> 15:41.673
Max, don't do this to me.

15:41.675 --> 15:44.108
I know where the bodies
are buried, literally.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.078
I move them every six months.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.413
Well, what is it?

15:48.415 --> 15:51.549
Han, sometimes in life,
things happen

15:51.551 --> 15:53.685
that you don't want
to happen.

15:53.687 --> 15:56.054
Yes.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.488
And even though it's hard,
you know,

15:57.490 --> 15:59.724
you just have to face up
to it.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.126
I suppose.

16:02.128 --> 16:06.064
Oh, dear god, this is rough.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.266
And, well...

16:08.268 --> 16:09.834
Han, I don't wanna have
to tell you this,

16:09.836 --> 16:12.637
I know this is the last thing
you ever want to hear--

16:12.639 --> 16:13.905
oh, just say it!

16:13.907 --> 16:19.110
The tampon machine
is broken again.

16:19.112 --> 16:23.147
Later, I'll get my blindfold
and fix it.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.882
Word of advice?

16:24.884 --> 16:26.184
When you do finally
kill me,

16:26.186 --> 16:28.786
you gotta work on your game face
for the cops.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.021
Max, please.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.756
I can't tell han
I murdered his fish.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.790
I can't.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.992
Well, I can't tell him either.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.693
Oh, hell, I'll tell him.

16:35.695 --> 16:41.532
I'm a black man, everyone
already assumes I did it.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.334
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.937
It's just a fish.
He'll be fine.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.905
I've decided I'll give blue
the new house

16:47.907 --> 16:50.408
at its birthday party later.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.745
It's the damn fish's birthday?

16:53.747 --> 16:55.780
I'm out.

16:56.815 --> 16:59.083
And you're all invited.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.651
Blue's two years old today.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.688
They don't usually live
that long.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.257
No, they do not.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.626
That's it, we can't tell him.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.395
Even at han's age,
which I am guessing

17:10.397 --> 17:15.333
is somewhere between
14 and 53,

17:15.335 --> 17:17.735
some kids just aren't ready
to grow up.

17:17.737 --> 17:18.970
What are we gonna do?

17:18.972 --> 17:20.938
We're gonna run out
and buy a new one.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.140
Where are we gonna get
the money?

17:22.142 --> 17:25.143
Oleg, you know how
two years ago

17:25.145 --> 17:27.145
you offered me $1,000
for a back rub?

17:27.147 --> 17:28.413
Of course.

17:28.415 --> 17:32.083
Caroline will do it
for $500.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.485
Deal.
One last hurrah.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.953
Over the clothes,
above the waist,

17:35.955 --> 17:38.656
and I don't know why,
but you have to wear a condom.

17:44.596 --> 17:48.332
Yes, father Dominic rosello,
please.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.635
Oh, he's celebrating mass?

17:50.637 --> 17:54.439
Oh yeah, could you just tell him
that Sophie kachinski

17:54.441 --> 17:57.341
is converting to monogamy?

17:57.343 --> 18:03.347
And uh, she won't be kneeling
at his altar anymore.

18:03.349 --> 18:08.086
Oh, yeah, yeah,
he'll understand.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.787
Where's han
and does he know?

18:09.789 --> 18:13.291
No, but I can't keep pretending
I see that fish.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.293
I'm a pot-head
with a touch of glaucoma.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.595
I'm seeing stuff
that's not there.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.197
Not seeing stuff
that's there

18:19.199 --> 18:21.833
it's confusing.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.167
Okay.
Come on, come on.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.836
Put it in, put it in,
put it in.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.971
I have a whole new respect
for every guy

18:26.973 --> 18:29.640
that's ever gone out
with you.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.742
Happy birthday, blue!

18:31.744 --> 18:36.981
(Han)
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, blue.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.082
Where's blue?

18:38.084 --> 18:39.283
I haven't seen her
all day.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.318
I just saw it.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.787
Yeah, it was definitely there.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.422
You're not gonna give blue
that cupcake

18:44.424 --> 18:46.290
without a photo-op, are you?
Where's your iPad?

18:46.292 --> 18:49.627
I just saw it.
Yeah, it was definitely there.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.728
Yeah, han, go!

18:50.730 --> 18:52.897
You need a pic so you can
post it on Facebook

18:52.899 --> 18:54.198
or fishbook or whatever.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.733
Good idea.
Here, hold this.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.770
Hey, Caroline,
you look less flat.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.573
You finally get that boob job
you needed?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.011
I feel like the baggy broke.

19:07.013 --> 19:13.217
Yup, that's what happens
when you get the cheap implants.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.186
Oh, my god,
there is definitely something

19:15.188 --> 19:16.787
moving around in my bra.

19:16.789 --> 19:20.291
Well, it's good you can still
recognize that feeling.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.660
It's right--oh! Oh!
I touched it!

19:22.662 --> 19:23.794
Gross!

19:23.796 --> 19:26.130
Someone, put your hand in my bra
and help me.

19:26.132 --> 19:29.000
Why now?
Now that I'm off the market!

19:29.002 --> 19:30.635
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.070
I'm afraid I'm gonna squish it
and kill it again.

19:33.072 --> 19:38.109
Okay, just get up on the counter
and drop it in the tank.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.443
What?

19:39.445 --> 19:43.014
Get up on the counter,
spread your legs,

19:43.016 --> 19:46.717
and just let it fall
into the tank.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.052
You know what?

19:48.054 --> 19:51.856
Forget the back rub.
After this, we're square.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.258
Okay, straddle the tank,
pull out your uniform,

19:54.260 --> 19:56.194
and let it go.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.462
Now I owe you money.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.134
Just squat over the tank
like you're delivering

20:03.136 --> 20:05.236
a fish baby.

20:07.105 --> 20:09.140
I'm delivering a fish baby?

20:09.142 --> 20:11.342
This is where I'm at?

20:11.344 --> 20:13.911
Stop asking.
That's where you're at.

20:24.923 --> 20:29.827
Okay, now that I saw, right?

20:29.829 --> 20:30.928
Caroline, get down!

20:30.930 --> 20:33.364
It's not that kind of party.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.938
Max, you're really still gonna
send t-rux back?

20:40.940 --> 20:42.373
After we got bullied
by a kid

20:42.375 --> 20:44.775
with a tiffani Amber thiessen
pillow?

20:44.777 --> 20:48.212
Relax, t-rux is right over there
by the register.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.880
And by the way,
he's our first employee.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.383
Anytime we get a bone-head,
customer, he can say,

20:52.385 --> 20:53.751
"talk to the fist,"

20:53.753 --> 20:56.721
(both)
"'Cause the face is pissed."

20:56.723 --> 20:58.522
I'm just sending
my mother something

20:58.524 --> 21:00.458
to say thank you
for everything she gave me

21:00.460 --> 21:01.726
when I was a child.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.526
Aww, what's in there?

21:02.528 --> 21:04.395
Nothing!
