James, what happened
to your painting?

10:32.214 --> 10:34.675
{\an1}The paint was still wet
and the garbage bag stuck to it.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.052
Okay, when
did you paint it?

10:36.135 --> 10:37.345
{\an5}This morning.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.186
eating a bologna sandwich,

19:48.270 --> 19:50.480
looking at the doctors from
"Emergency!" and thinking,

19:50.564 --> 19:53.066
{\an1}"When I grow up, I can't
wait to help those in need."

19:53.150 --> 19:56.069
{\an1}Oh, no, that's not
why I wanted to be a doctor.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.405
It was Nurse Dixie.

20:00.198 --> 20:02.784
She was hot.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.286
Are you serious?

20:04.369 --> 20:07.581
You wasted $600
just to ogle a thermos?

20:07.664 --> 20:09.791
{\an1}Hmm, I would have paid
twice as much.

20:09.875 --> 20:10.792
You don't just trip over

20:10.876 --> 20:12.628
a childhood treasure
like this every day.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.673
Look what I got.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.467
Where'd you get that?

20:18.550 --> 20:22.095
{\an1}I liked yours, so I went
to Oldpeoplelunchboxes.com.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.224
Set me back five bucks,
but check out the nurse

20:26.308 --> 20:28.310
on the thermos.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.359
