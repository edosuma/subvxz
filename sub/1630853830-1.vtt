Here we go, girls. Come on.

1:22:04.832 --> 1:22:06.095

1:22:06.138 --> 1:22:08.097
Come on, get behind me. Join us.

1:22:08.140 --> 1:22:10.012
Yeah, got a really important
job today.

1:22:10.055 --> 1:22:11.709
-Ooh, you look lovely,
but come on. -Mrs. Harris!

1:22:11.752 --> 1:22:14.146
-Come and do this for me.
-Mrs. Harris!

1:22:14.190 --> 1:22:15.974
You must stop this at once.

1:22:16.018 --> 1:22:17.715
You have no idea
what you are doing.

1:22:17.758 --> 1:22:19.108
Oh, yes, I do.

1:22:19.151 --> 1:22:20.544
It's called a strike.

1:22:22.850 --> 1:22:24.417
Right, ladies, come on.

1:22:24.461 --> 1:22:26.332
Follow me.
No time for that, dear.

1:22:26.376 --> 1:22:28.508
Oi! No need to push and shove.
Come on.

1:22:34.297 --> 1:22:36.777
On your feet, André.
There's work to be done.

1:22:48.746 --> 1:22:51.053
Mrs. Harris, I beg of you,
do not do this.

1:22:51.096 --> 1:22:53.446
This is your chance, André,
and how many chances

1:22:53.490 --> 1:22:55.100
-do you get in your lifetime?
-No, look...

1:22:56.362 --> 1:22:58.886
Monsieur Dior, ten minutes
of your time, please.

1:22:58.930 --> 1:23:01.628
That's all Mr. Fauvel needs
to save the company.

1:23:01.672 --> 1:23:03.456
Me? What do I-I...

1:23:05.371 --> 1:23:07.634
Go on, pet. You can do it.
Tell him your plan.

1:23:07.678 --> 1:23:09.593
-Uh...
-Go on.

Rather than the world
coming to Avenue Montaigne,

1:23:25.870 --> 1:23:27.698

available to all.

1:23:30.092 --> 1:23:34.226

luxury that...

can afford.

1:23:45.281 --> 1:23:46.543

You and me, you know,
we're two peas in a pod.

1:27:54.094 --> 1:27:55.966
We clean up everybody's mess

1:27:56.009 --> 1:27:58.229

She's got to be here somewhere.

1:28:40.706 --> 1:28:42.404
She's gone. It's for the best.

the girl doesn't want it.

1:29:52.387 --> 1:29:54.606
Mrs. Harris is right.

1:29:54.650 --> 1:29:56.695
It's not who I am.

1:29:56.739 --> 1:29:59.742

y-you find yourself conflicted

1:30:08.838 --> 1:30:10.535
that involves consciousness,

1:30:10.579 --> 1:30:13.582

are être-pour-soi.
