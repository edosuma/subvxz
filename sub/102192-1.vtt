M_I_SForEver

03:24.797 --> 03:26.098
It's not enough.

03:26.132 --> 03:28.134
You have to buy more.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.268
What should I get?

03:29.302 --> 03:32.705
Have you seen our lovely
collection of CDs for a dollar?

03:37.810 --> 03:39.544
This whole section's
only a dollar?

03:39.578 --> 03:41.147
- Yeah.
- We prefer to think of it

03:41.180 --> 03:43.983
of an installation.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.718
'Cause nothing here ever moves?

03:45.751 --> 03:47.452
It's our statement
on the music industry.

03:47.485 --> 03:48.620
Mm.

03:51.657 --> 03:53.759
You can't leave
until you find at least one CD

03:53.793 --> 03:55.628
you want to buy for a dollar.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.765
Guys, this is really depressing.

03:59.799 --> 04:02.434
Hey, imagine if you'd signed
those bands.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.569
You know, we can actually
stay open till midnight

04:04.603 --> 04:06.404
if you need some more time.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.056
You got this.

04:37.904 --> 04:39.105
Hey.

04:39.138 --> 04:42.708
So it's kind of slow today.

04:42.742 --> 04:43.943
Rub it in.

04:43.976 --> 04:45.845
Yeah.

04:45.878 --> 04:47.880
Would it be okay
if I set up my laptop back here

04:47.914 --> 04:50.116
after I got off?

04:50.149 --> 04:52.718
I'm trying to avoid
my roommates.

04:52.752 --> 04:54.987
How long is this
gonna go on for, Duane?

04:55.021 --> 04:57.089
Just till the end of the month.

04:57.123 --> 04:58.891
Okay.

04:58.925 --> 05:01.493
I'm so glad I'm not
in my twenties anymore.

05:01.526 --> 05:03.029
Thanks.

05:05.031 --> 05:06.799
- Duane.
- Yeah?

05:06.832 --> 05:10.136
What is it you're always working
on on that laptop of yours?

05:10.169 --> 05:11.804
Just more playlists.

05:11.837 --> 05:13.072
Like right now
I'm working on one

05:13.105 --> 05:15.041
that's a history
of New York rock.

05:15.074 --> 05:18.543
Like the one definitive track
for each band.

05:18.576 --> 05:20.846
You ever thought about a blog?

05:20.880 --> 05:22.214
Uh...

05:22.248 --> 05:25.017
Seriously,
you should post it online.

05:25.051 --> 05:27.086
I don't know, I mean,

05:27.119 --> 05:30.189
everyone has one, so,
who would ever read it?

05:30.222 --> 05:31.857
You never know, do you?

05:31.891 --> 05:33.826
It might lead to something,

05:33.859 --> 05:35.061
give you an outlet.

05:35.094 --> 05:37.930
Yeah, I'll think about it.

05:45.638 --> 05:47.640
Thank you for your patronage.

05:47.673 --> 05:49.842
You should come with me
to Coachella this year.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.011
Hang in the VIP tent.

05:52.044 --> 05:54.880
I only listen to
the LA Philharmonic.

05:54.914 --> 05:57.683
Are they playing Coachella
this year?

05:57.717 --> 06:00.252
- The Sahara tent.
- No.

06:05.825 --> 06:07.827
No, come on, man.

06:07.860 --> 06:10.096
Don't tell me you like that,
you of all people.

06:10.129 --> 06:12.164
- What does that mean?
- You're the one that's saying

06:12.198 --> 06:14.867
that you can't stand those bands
that have the...

06:14.900 --> 06:15.935
hold on, what was it...

06:15.968 --> 06:19.638
the Williamsburg Testicle-Free
Seal of Approval.

06:19.672 --> 06:22.274
Was that me that said that?

06:22.308 --> 06:24.176
Come on, dude, all I'm saying
is if we open up for them

06:24.210 --> 06:26.212
at the Palladium,
that's huge for us.

06:26.245 --> 06:27.646
They have a following!

06:27.680 --> 06:29.614
Come on, man,
they've been dishing out

06:29.648 --> 06:32.251
that Warmed-Over Krautrock
for years now.

06:32.284 --> 06:33.919
I can't believe the hipsters
are still buying it.

06:33.953 --> 06:35.755
Are you listening to yourself
right now?

06:35.788 --> 06:37.089
Warmed-Over Krautrock?

06:37.123 --> 06:38.224
What does that even mean?

06:38.257 --> 06:40.760
Yeah, Duane speaks in rock
critic, you need subtitles

06:40.793 --> 06:42.795
in front of him so you
understand what he's saying.

06:42.828 --> 06:45.264
- I do not speak in rock critic.
- Yeah, you do.

06:45.297 --> 06:48.000
You guys coming to my show
on Tuesday by the way?

06:48.034 --> 06:50.102
I've seen you play
like seven times.

06:50.136 --> 06:52.071
I have actually seen you play
in every place

06:52.104 --> 06:53.706
that you've ever played.

06:53.739 --> 06:56.608
But I need you there,
you're objective.

06:56.642 --> 06:59.345
- I need your opinion.
- Aw.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.578
Wait, did you get another show?

07:00.612 --> 07:04.216
Yeah, yeah, another out of work
actor is putting on a showcase

07:04.250 --> 07:08.254
and he needs set design
that he can't afford to pay for.

07:08.287 --> 07:09.922
Right on, well,
I hope somebody comes

07:09.955 --> 07:12.291
and shows up and digs your work.

07:12.324 --> 07:13.225
Well, I'll be there.

07:13.259 --> 07:14.193
You guys going on first again?

07:14.226 --> 07:17.229
No, man, third,
11 o'clock start time.

07:17.263 --> 07:18.864
Nice, look at you guys!

07:18.898 --> 07:20.332
- Moving up in the world.
- Mm!

07:22.735 --> 07:24.070
- Ow, ow!
- Oh-ho!

07:24.103 --> 07:25.671
Again with the tie!

07:25.704 --> 07:27.039
Look, I've got
to leave again early.

07:27.073 --> 07:28.741
Can you guys lock up for me?

07:28.774 --> 07:29.642
Yeah, we're good.

07:29.675 --> 07:32.078
Where you going all
respectable-like?

07:32.111 --> 07:33.813
Sex addict support group.

07:33.846 --> 07:35.815
It's a terrible affliction.

07:35.848 --> 07:37.249
Hey, are you off the clock?

07:37.283 --> 07:40.052
Uh, yeah, no,
I'm just hanging out.

07:43.089 --> 07:45.024
You know, six hours
of used record time's

07:45.057 --> 07:47.359
- just not enough for this guy.
- Yeah, I caught him sleeping

07:47.393 --> 07:49.128
in the easy listening section
last week.

07:49.161 --> 07:51.697
Oh yeah right,
the easy listening.

07:51.730 --> 07:54.133
- Loving the t-shirt.
- Thank you.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.836
Yeah, a friend of mine
made it for me.

07:56.869 --> 07:58.838
We should sell them
in the store.

08:13.752 --> 08:16.355
I'm gonna say one person
in the next three hours.

08:16.388 --> 08:18.657
Ooh, oh,
let's not get crazy now.

08:18.691 --> 08:21.026
No, no, no, no, he's right.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.862
Today is the day
it all turns around.

08:22.895 --> 08:26.065
There is a huge pent up demand
out there.

08:26.098 --> 08:28.067
I can, I can just feel it.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.301
Hm.

08:29.335 --> 08:31.804
I do think though if somebody
comes in and buys something,

08:31.837 --> 08:33.239
- we should give them a beer.
- Probably.

08:33.272 --> 08:35.107
Speaking of which,
is it my turn to buy?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.107
- Yeah.
- Yes.

08:36.142 --> 08:37.876
All right.

08:37.909 --> 08:41.080
See if you can find that beer
that tastes like banana bread.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.959
No, no, no, no, no, the cut off
line is Some Girls.

08:53.993 --> 08:56.395
After that, the iron gate
comes crashing down.

08:56.428 --> 08:57.997
That's it, period.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.999
Come on, you gotta give 'em
Tattoo You.

09:00.032 --> 09:01.934
- Start Me Up?
- Come on,

09:01.967 --> 09:05.070
most of that album was Mick
dubbing in vocals over tracks

09:05.104 --> 09:07.239
they've had in the can
for years.

09:07.273 --> 09:09.909
Hey, Mick Taylor is all over it.

09:09.942 --> 09:11.911
Mick Taylor's
my secret boyfriend.

09:11.944 --> 09:13.245
- Good one.
- Right?

09:13.279 --> 09:15.047
How do you know
who Mick Taylor is?

09:15.080 --> 09:17.249
Dude, my dad
has all those records.

09:17.283 --> 09:18.984
Condescend much?

09:19.018 --> 09:21.420
- I wasn't being condescending.
- Uh...

09:21.453 --> 09:22.955
Was I being condescending?

09:22.988 --> 09:24.423
How long have
we worked together?

09:24.456 --> 09:26.859
I'm sorry, it's just most girls
your age don't...

09:26.892 --> 09:28.928
Dude, d... d... d...

09:28.961 --> 09:30.796
since when has Lysette
done anything

09:30.829 --> 09:32.765
- like most girls our age?
- Thank you.

09:32.798 --> 09:34.300
Yes.

09:36.969 --> 09:41.440
Oh God, it's so sweet that
you're so upset about it.

09:50.082 --> 09:52.418
- It's easy, Elvis.
- Oh, lame.

09:52.451 --> 09:53.752
- Why?
- It's obvious!

09:53.786 --> 09:55.788
It's not... who could fault me?

09:55.821 --> 09:58.224
Wait, okay, why, why do guys
always have to say Elvis

09:58.257 --> 10:00.025
when they're asked
who they would sleep with

10:00.059 --> 10:00.993
if they had to sleep with a guy?

10:01.026 --> 10:02.494
- Why wouldn't ya?
- Why, because it's

10:02.528 --> 10:04.930
the easy choice for
straight guys, that's why.

10:04.964 --> 10:06.865
Oh, the easy choice, fine.

10:06.899 --> 10:09.001
All right,
Mr. I Live on the Edge then.

10:09.034 --> 10:10.369
Come on, hit me,
what's your choice?

10:10.402 --> 10:12.471
I'm gonna go
with George Harrison.

10:12.504 --> 10:14.039
Agh, can't you guys get it up

10:14.073 --> 10:15.241
for somebody
in the last 40 years?

10:15.274 --> 10:18.244
- Somebody that's actually alive.
- Hold on, hold on, yeah.

10:18.277 --> 10:20.279
Just explain your choice first.

10:20.312 --> 10:22.815
First of all,
he just looks so cool

10:22.848 --> 10:24.049
in every picture
with The Beatles.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.985
Doesn't matter what year.

10:26.018 --> 10:30.022
Second, he was such an admirable
person in real life.

10:30.055 --> 10:30.956
- Hm.
- Hm, aren't you gonna

10:30.990 --> 10:34.560
ask him how he knows
who George Harrison is?

10:34.593 --> 10:36.528
God, I'm never gonna
live that down, am I?

10:36.562 --> 10:38.797
- No.
- And you know what the thing is,

10:38.831 --> 10:40.899
I don't even wanna sleep
with the guy.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.802
I wanna have like a mystical,

10:43.836 --> 10:46.272
spiritual union with him.

10:46.305 --> 10:47.339
What?

10:47.373 --> 10:49.908
A mystical, spiritual union?

10:49.942 --> 10:50.809
What does that mean?

10:50.843 --> 10:52.278
Haven't you guys
ever wanted to live

10:52.311 --> 10:54.046
beyond the grasp
of material things?

10:54.079 --> 10:55.247
No!

10:55.281 --> 10:57.216
That's what he was all about.

10:57.249 --> 10:58.550
Hm.

10:58.584 --> 10:59.653
Who are you?

10:59.686 --> 11:03.188
I mean, where are these
hidden depths coming from?

11:03.222 --> 11:05.157
Stereotype much?

11:05.190 --> 11:07.459
Look beyond the tattoos, dude.

11:07.493 --> 11:09.561
That should be an album title

11:09.595 --> 11:12.931
or like a lyric or something,
it'd be great.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.334
Are we not drinking ourselves
into oblivion?

11:15.367 --> 11:18.437
You can if you want,
unless you want a ride.

11:24.076 --> 11:27.346
Twice now I've offered to bring
in my own speakers.

11:27.379 --> 11:29.415
- And?
- He keeps putting me off.

11:29.448 --> 11:32.184
He says he's gonna fix
the PA system himself.

11:32.217 --> 11:33.986
He must not wanna spend
the money right now.

11:34.019 --> 11:36.955
How much does it cost
to set up an iPod dock?

11:36.989 --> 11:40.893
Have you ever heard of a record
store that can't play music?

11:40.926 --> 11:43.896
What kind of a message
does that send?

11:43.929 --> 11:45.597
It's not good.

11:45.632 --> 11:47.166
We're not doing any in-stores.

11:47.199 --> 11:49.636
Or record release parties.

11:49.669 --> 11:52.271
Where do you guys think he's
going when he puts on that tie?

11:52.304 --> 11:53.505
I mean, do you think
he's skipping out

11:53.539 --> 11:54.606
on us for interviews?

11:54.641 --> 11:56.875
Maybe he's going to
a speed dating service for,

11:56.909 --> 11:59.478
like, middle-aged indie dudes.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.514
I wish he could meet someone.

12:02.548 --> 12:05.884
Seriously, I mean,
do you know where he's going?

12:05.918 --> 12:07.252
Oh, I have no clue.

12:20.432 --> 12:24.370
So when am I gonna get the
chance to show my hidden depths?

12:24.403 --> 12:27.506
I mean, tell me that, my friend.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.375
How long am I gonna keep
living like this,

12:29.408 --> 12:32.010
like only halfway in the world?

12:34.313 --> 12:37.282
I mean, the songs playing
in my head are so much more real

12:37.316 --> 12:41.453
and intense than anything
going on in my real life.

12:41.487 --> 12:43.922
Do you ever feel like that?

12:43.956 --> 12:45.391
You must.

12:45.424 --> 12:47.393
I just thought that when
my real life started, like,

12:47.426 --> 12:52.564
music would just fade
to the background.

12:52.598 --> 12:54.933
Like it'd be the soundtrack

12:54.967 --> 12:59.138
to my exciting, fulfilling life.

13:02.274 --> 13:06.178
You know, I can tell you
from every date in college

13:06.211 --> 13:08.046
what song was playing

13:08.080 --> 13:11.651
in the car, the club, bar,

13:11.684 --> 13:13.619
whatever, I can name 'em all.

13:17.423 --> 13:19.358
God, those poor girls though.

13:21.527 --> 13:23.996
Did I ever shut up?

13:24.029 --> 13:26.999
I don't know,
but music's my life.

13:27.032 --> 13:31.069
But I don't play an instrument,
I don't sing.

13:31.103 --> 13:33.673
I can't write or read music.

13:33.706 --> 13:36.241
I don't create anything.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.010
I don't add to anything.

13:40.012 --> 13:43.515
You probably can't even imagine
what that's like.

13:43.549 --> 13:47.119
Chris, Chris plays in a band.

13:47.152 --> 13:49.455
They're a loud, heavy,
sweaty band.

13:49.488 --> 13:53.258
"Ahhh" and all that.

13:53.292 --> 13:56.094
But I don't know, I still

13:56.128 --> 13:57.563
would love to know
what it's like

13:57.596 --> 14:01.233
to live in that moment
of performance.

14:01.266 --> 14:05.404
Like, where there's no gap
between being and creating.

14:05.437 --> 14:07.072
A work of art isn't something

14:07.105 --> 14:08.675
that you turn over endlessly
in your head.

14:08.708 --> 14:11.243
It's just there.

14:13.078 --> 14:16.615
And when it's done, it's gone.

14:16.649 --> 14:18.183
But you did it.

14:22.054 --> 14:24.757
So when am I gonna get
the chance to tell everyone

14:24.791 --> 14:28.360
all the things
I need to tell them?

14:28.393 --> 14:30.062
Tell me that, my friend.

15:29.656 --> 15:31.390
Hey, man.

15:31.423 --> 15:33.191
What's up?

15:41.433 --> 15:45.270
Uh, so what's up with the shirt?

15:46.773 --> 15:49.608
Oh, yeah,
this chick gave it to me.

15:49.642 --> 15:52.177
It's a memento.

15:52.210 --> 15:56.515
Isn't it a little early
for Twilight irony?

15:56.548 --> 15:59.418
- Twilight irony?
- Yeah.

15:59.451 --> 16:00.753
I mean, all the girls
that saw that movie

16:00.787 --> 16:02.722
when they were 12
are like 18 now

16:02.755 --> 16:05.591
and they're still probably
in love with the guy.

16:08.293 --> 16:11.263
So you can pull
that t-shirt off.

16:11.296 --> 16:14.466
If I wore a Twilight shirt,
if I was being ironic,

16:14.499 --> 16:16.234
I'd look like an asshole.

16:16.268 --> 16:20.572
And if not,
I'd look beyond pathetic.

16:22.574 --> 16:24.744
Yeah, you would.

16:28.948 --> 16:31.918
Hey, did you see that shirt that
Chris was wearing yesterday?

16:31.951 --> 16:35.855
Let me guess,
you wanna make fun of it?

16:35.888 --> 16:38.523
No, it actually got me thinking.

16:38.557 --> 16:40.927
You know, in like
five or ten years time,

16:40.960 --> 16:43.763
Twilight irony
could be big business.

16:43.796 --> 16:46.231
Twilight irony.

16:46.264 --> 16:47.800
You know that sounds
an awful lot like rock critic.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.636
Didn't we talk about that?

16:49.669 --> 16:51.503
I'm being serious.

16:51.536 --> 16:53.472
Watch, in five
to ten years time,

16:53.505 --> 16:56.408
Twilight irony
is gonna be a thing.

16:56.441 --> 16:58.210
'Cause all those girls
that saw the movie

16:58.243 --> 17:00.379
are gonna be old enough
to have their own bands

17:00.412 --> 17:02.247
and club nights and things,

17:02.280 --> 17:05.384
and they'll appropriate that
imagery from their adolescence.

17:05.416 --> 17:08.387
Put a new spin on it.

17:08.420 --> 17:11.256
You've got your finger
on the pulse.

17:11.289 --> 17:13.893
Look, somebody's gonna make
a buck off it.

17:13.925 --> 17:15.394
Maybe it should be me.

17:15.426 --> 17:18.296
I didn't know
you were so ambitious.

17:18.329 --> 17:21.634
I keep my plans for world
domination well hidden.

17:21.667 --> 17:22.868
Very well hidden.

18:05.011 --> 18:07.714
Sweetheart, do we really have
to document everything I do?

18:07.747 --> 18:08.915
Don't be self-conscious.

18:08.948 --> 18:11.349
Come on, you were gonna do
reality TV.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.385
Don't remind me.

18:13.418 --> 18:16.956
Look over your shoulder,
one more.

18:18.623 --> 18:21.560
Now, you do know I'm not
a rock star yet, right?

18:21.593 --> 18:24.496
You were born a rock star.

18:24.529 --> 18:26.899
These are great,
we'll use 'em for your Tumblr.

18:26.933 --> 18:29.501
Oh, great, my Tumblr.

18:29.534 --> 18:32.604
My Facebook, my Instagram,
my Twitter.

18:32.638 --> 18:35.607
What?

18:35.641 --> 18:37.442
Nothing.

18:58.731 --> 19:00.967
- Good morning.
- Morning.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.468
I can use one of them,
thank you.

19:06.505 --> 19:08.708
- Big day.
- Yeah, I was gonna pop out

19:08.741 --> 19:10.509
during lunch and show my work.

19:10.542 --> 19:11.644
Fine.

19:11.677 --> 19:14.981
Onwards and upwards.

19:15.014 --> 19:17.049
Do you know if Chris
has a gig this week?

19:17.083 --> 19:19.085
I'm thinking about going
and checking it out.

19:19.118 --> 19:21.553
Yeah, it's on Tuesday
but I'm not gonna go.

19:21.586 --> 19:24.356
- Had enough?
- I've seen him like seven times.

19:24.389 --> 19:26.525
I feel like I've done my duty
at this point.

19:26.558 --> 19:28.895
I know what you mean.

19:28.928 --> 19:30.595
They're really good though.

19:30.630 --> 19:32.765
- Dude, the guitarist.
- Kyle.

19:32.799 --> 19:34.801
- Kid can play.
- Yeah.

19:34.834 --> 19:37.536
Him and Chris together,
they could really do something.

19:37.569 --> 19:40.006
Yeah, but whenever
I go see them,

19:40.039 --> 19:44.342
Chris has all those girls
hanging on him,

19:44.376 --> 19:45.945
and then I go backstage
to say hi

19:45.978 --> 19:48.613
and they're all like...

19:48.648 --> 19:50.883
Agh, you can tell they're trying
to decide if I'm someone

19:50.917 --> 19:52.685
they need to be nice to or not.

19:52.718 --> 19:54.687
Last time I went,

19:54.720 --> 19:56.889
some girl asked me
whose dad I was.

19:56.923 --> 19:58.557
Ouch.

20:00.993 --> 20:03.461
Kinda hate being
in that situation.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.764
Backstage, yeah?

20:04.797 --> 20:07.099
You know, like,
the girl hanging out

20:07.133 --> 20:10.002
with all the stud musicians.

20:10.036 --> 20:10.970
You're not a musician too,

20:11.003 --> 20:14.941
they're never really
gonna respect you.

20:14.974 --> 20:18.945
Chris is a really cool guy,
but at his shows

20:18.978 --> 20:22.148
I feel like even he expects me
to be his fan club.

20:22.181 --> 20:23.582
Ego fluffer.

20:34.894 --> 20:37.029
You call that guy yet?

20:41.100 --> 20:43.035
Who?

20:43.069 --> 20:46.605
That guy I was telling
you about, Johnny.

20:48.540 --> 20:51.409
- Johnny.
- What?

20:51.443 --> 20:53.445
He knows everybody.

20:56.048 --> 20:57.750
Johnny.

20:57.783 --> 21:00.953
- He's a song doctor.
- So?

21:00.987 --> 21:03.956
He could really help you guys.

21:03.990 --> 21:06.424
Come on, you know
we're not that kind of band.

21:06.458 --> 21:09.762
- You're not.
- What?

21:09.795 --> 21:13.565
You and Kyle are like a boy band
for girls with tattoos.

21:13.598 --> 21:15.101
You just don't know it yet.

21:15.134 --> 21:18.603
Oh yeah, is that right?

21:18.638 --> 21:20.907
Well, thanks.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.942
I guess.

21:31.083 --> 21:36.554
So, I have my own table
at Comic-Con this year.

21:36.588 --> 21:37.823
You wanna come with?

21:37.857 --> 21:39.624
You could be my booth babe.

21:44.496 --> 21:47.099
I was just joking
about booth babe.

21:56.508 --> 21:57.810
I think you'd be
a great booth babe.

21:57.843 --> 22:00.012
Booth babe!

22:01.247 --> 22:03.515
What's up, Walt man?

22:07.219 --> 22:08.321
You okay?

22:08.354 --> 22:12.892
Yeah, I'm just sorting out
some finances, you know.

22:12.925 --> 22:17.196
So, tell us about the meeting
with the big time manager.

22:17.229 --> 22:18.965
- Oh, yeah.
- How did that go?

22:18.998 --> 22:19.865
Awesome,
you wouldn't believe it.

22:19.899 --> 22:21.968
He has gold records
all over his wall.

22:23.669 --> 22:25.271
Every day it's the same thing.

22:25.304 --> 22:26.973
What, here?

22:27.006 --> 22:29.574
No!

22:29.607 --> 22:31.609
Chris has Walt hooked.

22:31.644 --> 22:33.679
All he has to do
is come in and spin tales

22:33.713 --> 22:35.214
about his band
trying to make it in the biz

22:35.247 --> 22:38.851
and then Walt'll let him
show up as late as he wants,

22:38.884 --> 22:42.655
make phone calls, leave early.

22:42.688 --> 22:47.293
It's like Chris is Scheherazade
or something.

22:47.326 --> 22:49.762
I know who Scheherazade is.

22:49.795 --> 22:52.530
- I didn't say anything, I...
- Oh no?

22:52.564 --> 22:53.866
But you were gonna.

22:53.899 --> 22:56.002
But he was telling me,
he's like, he's like,

22:56.035 --> 22:58.170
"You like albums, I like albums.

22:58.204 --> 23:00.572
We all like albums,
I'm not talking about albums.

23:00.605 --> 23:03.242
All I need is five killer tracks
that I can license."

23:03.275 --> 23:05.077
Wow.

23:05.111 --> 23:06.812
There it is.

23:06.846 --> 23:08.781
The industry in a nutshell, man.

23:08.814 --> 23:11.283
Yeah, no joke.

23:11.317 --> 23:13.819
You know,
it's really not cool of you

23:13.853 --> 23:15.688
to talk behind people's backs,

23:15.721 --> 23:17.622
especially since Walt
is super cool

23:17.656 --> 23:19.025
and he lets you hang out here

23:19.058 --> 23:21.593
so you don't have to see
your roommates.

23:25.831 --> 23:27.833
Was I being lame?

23:31.971 --> 23:34.140
Would it help if I got beer?

23:34.173 --> 23:35.607
That would be a start.

23:37.777 --> 23:41.814
The wife and me split around
the time of the dot-com boom.

23:41.847 --> 23:44.350
The store got priced out
of San Francisco

23:44.383 --> 23:45.985
and I moved down here.

23:46.018 --> 23:49.088
Couldn't believe how cheap
the leases were in LA.

23:49.121 --> 23:51.724
Wait, so you and your wife
ran the record store up there?

23:51.757 --> 23:53.591
We were just off
the Lower Haight.

23:53.625 --> 23:57.863
It was when alternative rock
was really kicking in.

23:57.897 --> 23:59.999
And for a while, it was like
the store was this...

24:03.769 --> 24:05.905
Hey, boss, tell us again
how you saw Nirvana

24:05.938 --> 24:09.607
before Nevermind came out.

24:09.642 --> 24:13.345
Duane, are you being lame?

24:13.379 --> 24:14.980
No.

24:16.849 --> 24:17.883
That's her there.

24:17.917 --> 24:20.786
Oh, so you were married
to Neko Case.

24:20.820 --> 24:23.022
No, this one.

24:25.124 --> 24:28.360
No way.

24:28.394 --> 24:30.629
Damn, she's actually
kinda good-looking.

24:30.663 --> 24:32.331
- Uh, thanks.
- No, I'm just saying

24:32.364 --> 24:33.966
it doesn't look like
a green card marriage.

24:33.999 --> 24:36.936
Yeah, well, didn't hurt
the foot traffic in the store,

24:36.969 --> 24:38.137
if you know what I mean.

24:40.372 --> 24:42.675
You should come with me
to Coachella this year.

24:42.708 --> 24:45.845
I know people, we can party
in the VIP tent.

24:45.878 --> 24:47.646
I'm more of a Stagecoach girl.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.882
Oh, me too.

24:49.915 --> 24:53.886
I mean, I love country music.

24:53.919 --> 24:56.222
Tim McGraw is a god.

25:02.461 --> 25:03.696
- Yeah.
- Hey, Lys,

25:03.729 --> 25:06.765
did you ever show that director
your set designs the other day?

25:06.799 --> 25:08.300
Yup.

25:08.334 --> 25:10.002
Did he hit on you too?

25:10.035 --> 25:11.837
Yeah.

25:11.871 --> 25:13.839
All right, well just make sure
you give me the address.

25:13.873 --> 25:16.008
I'll send Duane over there
to beat his ass.

25:16.041 --> 25:18.844
I'll do it, I'll walk in
with a Japanese import disc

25:18.878 --> 25:20.813
and take his head off.

25:20.846 --> 25:24.316
Well, I kinda pictured you
talking him to death.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.252
Thank you, guys, but um,

25:26.285 --> 25:30.122
let's wait to see if I get the
job first before you off him.

25:30.156 --> 25:31.690
Fine.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.966
A more diversified portfolio.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.170
You don't say?

25:44.203 --> 25:45.905
401K?

25:45.938 --> 25:48.674
I haven't even got half a K.

25:52.378 --> 25:55.381
A more aggressive rate
of return.

25:55.414 --> 25:57.316
So what would he suggest I do?

25:57.349 --> 26:00.786
How about I could sell weapons
to the Hezbollah?

26:00.819 --> 26:04.723
Open a car wash?

26:04.757 --> 26:07.459
Music is all I know, man.

26:07.493 --> 26:10.095
Music up to the year 2005.

26:10.129 --> 26:13.799
After that, I'm lost.

26:13.832 --> 26:15.201
Yeah.

26:16.769 --> 26:18.137
Yeah.

26:22.241 --> 26:23.876
Yeah.

26:39.358 --> 26:43.295
Yeah, man, there's plenty
of days where living in LA

26:43.329 --> 26:45.197
just seems like a big hassle.

26:48.567 --> 26:52.938
It's always during the day
when you're like...

26:52.972 --> 26:55.307
"Why do I put up
with this shit," you know?

26:58.811 --> 27:00.312
Come on!

27:00.346 --> 27:02.248
But at night,

27:02.281 --> 27:05.017
it wasn't until I moved to LA
that I realized...

27:05.050 --> 27:08.153
really appreciated
what magic hour meant.

27:08.187 --> 27:11.490
I mean, sometimes I feel like

27:11.523 --> 27:14.426
you can feel the whole city
just changing,

27:14.460 --> 27:16.862
coming to life, you know?

27:16.895 --> 27:20.065
After dark is the reward.

27:20.099 --> 27:23.836
It's like all these people
just coming out

27:23.869 --> 27:27.072
that you never see
during the day, you know?

27:27.106 --> 27:29.375
No one you'd ever see
in an office.

27:34.313 --> 27:36.315
Are we talking about girls here?

27:36.348 --> 27:40.119
Well, not just the girls.

27:40.152 --> 27:43.389
No, it's how it feels
when I go to a cool show.

27:43.422 --> 27:45.524
It's that vibe, you know?

27:45.557 --> 27:48.460
Kinda subterranean.

27:50.996 --> 27:53.399
Yeah, actually.

27:53.432 --> 27:55.934
And it's not just when we have
a cool show either.

27:55.968 --> 27:58.203
You know, once I go to any show,
it's like,

27:58.237 --> 28:00.839
this is what I live for,
you know?

28:00.873 --> 28:02.908
Like it's amazing
how a great show can just...

28:02.941 --> 28:07.079
just makes up for so much
in your life.

28:07.112 --> 28:10.282
It's like kinda
chasing a high in a way.

28:10.316 --> 28:12.951
So you let everything else
just slip away.

28:12.985 --> 28:16.155
That's why I put up
with the bullshit.

28:16.188 --> 28:18.123
You get one good night

28:18.157 --> 28:20.359
and it makes everything
that was hassling you at noon

28:20.392 --> 28:23.262
seem just so far away.

28:27.066 --> 28:28.567
You're up by noon?

28:28.600 --> 28:30.269
I remember what it was like.

28:36.542 --> 28:39.611
So...

28:39.646 --> 28:43.115
Do you have a boyfriend?

28:43.148 --> 28:46.552
Yeah, whenever I want.

28:46.585 --> 28:47.619
Hm.

28:52.124 --> 28:53.625
Bye!

28:56.696 --> 28:58.163
Good answer.

28:58.197 --> 29:00.132
He walked right into that.

29:27.259 --> 29:28.260
When you were growing up,

29:28.293 --> 29:31.497
did girls ever call you
Brain Duane?

29:31.530 --> 29:32.965
No.

29:32.998 --> 29:35.434
Why not?

29:35.467 --> 29:38.404
Seems like a wasted opportunity.

29:51.183 --> 29:53.285
Come on, man, give me a break.

29:53.318 --> 29:57.423
Those guys are like a dumbed
down California stoner version

29:57.456 --> 30:00.159
of The Jesus and Mary Chain.

30:00.192 --> 30:01.694
Is he always like this?

30:01.728 --> 30:04.596
They're like The Cure
got stoned with Sublime

30:04.631 --> 30:05.899
and lost all creativity.

30:05.931 --> 30:08.967
You say of the name of any band
and it's like pushing a button

30:09.001 --> 30:11.136
and out comes
a grammatically correct rant.

30:13.238 --> 30:17.109
This girl at the bar told me
I was like a walking Shazam app.

30:17.142 --> 30:19.478
I couldn't tell if she meant it
as a compliment or not.

30:36.729 --> 30:40.065
Check one, one, two, one.

30:40.098 --> 30:41.600
Check one, two, three.

30:41.634 --> 30:42.735
Check, check.

31:06.058 --> 31:07.426
You know it drives Kyle crazy

31:07.459 --> 31:09.328
when you're taking pictures
the entire set?

31:09.361 --> 31:11.063
He needs to get used to it.

31:11.096 --> 31:12.231
Well, maybe you could just stop

31:12.264 --> 31:13.766
taking pictures
after three songs.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.034
No, I need to take pictures
the whole show

31:16.068 --> 31:18.103
- to make sure that...
- You're not gonna get...

31:18.136 --> 31:21.306
Chris, when you guys
are performing,

31:21.340 --> 31:24.476
do you like completely escape
self consciousness?

31:26.445 --> 31:30.683
I'm just curious as a civilian.

31:30.717 --> 31:33.653
- That is the goal.
- Yeah.

31:33.686 --> 31:36.522
Sometimes, like when I lock in
with Kyle, you know?

31:39.324 --> 31:42.194
With the other guys, I feel like
I have to think about shit

31:42.227 --> 31:44.162
that I feel like I shouldn't
have to think about.

31:46.331 --> 31:49.434
Transcendence is hard
to come by.

31:49.468 --> 31:51.570
That's another album title
right there.

31:54.206 --> 31:55.708
Are you good?

31:55.742 --> 31:58.477
Yeah, no, I'm good.

32:25.437 --> 32:27.205
To transcendence.

32:37.884 --> 32:39.752
Last call.

32:41.754 --> 32:43.622
Walt knows exactly
what he's doing

32:43.656 --> 32:46.191
when he leaves her
up at the counter all day.

32:46.224 --> 32:48.695
And she knows
who Mick Taylor is.

32:48.728 --> 32:51.263
- The perfect woman.
- Yeah.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.803
Are you sweet on her?

32:58.671 --> 33:00.572
I don't know.

33:00.606 --> 33:01.674
Kinda.

33:01.708 --> 33:03.643
Well she just blows me away
with some of the stuff

33:03.676 --> 33:05.377
she comes out with sometimes.

33:05.410 --> 33:07.245
There's no dude in the picture?

33:07.279 --> 33:08.614
Not that I know of.

33:08.648 --> 33:11.149
Well, she's always
texting someone.

33:11.183 --> 33:13.686
Her theater people?

33:13.720 --> 33:15.520
Maybe, I don't know.

33:15.554 --> 33:17.222
I still can't get a read
on whether or not

33:17.255 --> 33:18.891
she'd be into me or not.

33:18.925 --> 33:20.860
Well, no offense,

33:20.893 --> 33:22.361
if she doesn't wanna sleep
with you,

33:22.394 --> 33:24.196
that doesn't really surprise me.

33:24.229 --> 33:26.198
It's not really what's
intriguing about her.

33:26.231 --> 33:28.801
Okay, and why wouldn't it
surprise you

33:28.835 --> 33:31.169
if she didn't wanna sleep
with me?

33:31.203 --> 33:32.772
Dude, don't you get it?

33:32.805 --> 33:35.173
You're radioactive to women
because you're so needy.

33:35.207 --> 33:37.777
Radioactive?

33:37.810 --> 33:40.212
I'm not radioactive.

33:40.245 --> 33:41.213
What are you...

33:41.246 --> 33:42.949
what does that even mean?

33:42.982 --> 33:46.585
You really didn't know?

33:46.618 --> 33:48.655
Anyways, like I was saying,

33:48.688 --> 33:50.690
what's interesting about Lysette
is that she doesn't even

33:50.723 --> 33:52.725
show any signs of wanting
to sleep with me,

33:52.759 --> 33:54.794
which is like,
what is she waiting for, right?

34:05.570 --> 34:08.239
There is no such thing
as underground anymore.

34:08.273 --> 34:11.309
The internet killed it.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.610
Nowadays, everywhere you go,

34:12.645 --> 34:15.748
it's the same overproduced
pussy-ass rock.

34:15.782 --> 34:16.882
You know?

34:16.916 --> 34:19.851
Yeah, so you only go for
the cutting-edge stuff, huh?

34:19.886 --> 34:23.255
Cutting-edge is the life I live.

34:23.288 --> 34:25.223
Come with me.

34:35.266 --> 34:36.969
I have to know.

34:37.003 --> 34:38.335
Are you for real?

34:38.370 --> 34:40.338
Did you mean what you just said?

34:40.371 --> 34:41.940
Yeah.

34:41.974 --> 34:44.710
We wouldn't offer this
to just anyone.

34:46.946 --> 34:51.684
The blogosphere
is on fire about this album.

34:51.717 --> 34:54.687
The band's name
is called Ass Spatter?

34:54.721 --> 34:56.822
You've never heard
of Ass Spatter?

34:56.856 --> 34:58.557
Dude, he's never heard
of Ass Spatter.

34:58.590 --> 35:01.326
I have, I've heard of Ass...
I dig their early stuff.

35:01.359 --> 35:02.594
When was this made?

35:02.628 --> 35:04.429
Just think of it as timeless,

35:04.463 --> 35:06.465
and you've gotta go
for the vinyl.

35:06.498 --> 35:09.367
You'd be missing out
on the whole vision

35:09.401 --> 35:11.503
if you went digital only.

35:11.536 --> 35:14.006
- Is this really rare?
- Dude.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.576
Thurston Moore cannot get
his hands on this record.

35:17.609 --> 35:19.879
- How much you want for it?
- We both know

35:19.912 --> 35:23.649
that you can't put a price
on transgression, but...

35:23.683 --> 35:27.385
we'll let you have it
for 20 bucks.

35:27.419 --> 35:28.721
Twenty bucks?

35:28.755 --> 35:30.923
Okay, I'll skip
pedicure this week.

35:30.957 --> 35:33.993
- Sign me up.
- Right on, dude.

35:50.777 --> 35:53.913
You got 20 bucks for that?

35:53.946 --> 35:55.614
Unbelievable.

35:55.648 --> 35:57.582
May I?

35:57.616 --> 35:59.584
Take that,
go get a bottle of champagne.

35:59.618 --> 36:00.653
Wow, it's that big of a deal?

36:00.686 --> 36:04.724
Oh yes, I've had that thing
since like '94.

36:04.757 --> 36:06.491
It was on the wall
in San Francisco.

36:06.525 --> 36:09.394
People used to come into
the store just to laugh at it.

36:09.427 --> 36:11.396
I can't believe you got rid
of the bloody thing.

36:11.429 --> 36:14.801
- Thank you.
- It was my pleasure.

36:17.136 --> 36:19.371
Right, I've got I Touch Myself,

36:19.404 --> 36:21.439
She Bop,
and Dancing With Myself.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.408
What else do you think
should be on there?

36:23.441 --> 36:26.813
Wow, you're really making
a playlist about masturbation.

36:26.846 --> 36:28.580
What else is there to do?

36:28.613 --> 36:31.717
A subject much on your mind?

36:31.751 --> 36:32.752
You just had to go there.

36:32.785 --> 36:34.954
You couldn't let that one
just pass you by.

36:34.987 --> 36:36.956
Well, of course, you've gotta
make the obvious play.

36:36.989 --> 36:39.524
Wouldn't indie rock guys
be more likely to write a song

36:39.558 --> 36:41.727
about masturbation
than classic rock guys?

36:43.562 --> 36:45.798
Discuss.

36:45.832 --> 36:47.566
- I do not hold forth.
- Yeah, you do.

36:47.599 --> 36:50.402
You sit on your stool
all day and you hold forth

36:50.435 --> 36:52.972
about music and about
television.

36:53.005 --> 36:54.707
It's true, dude, you do.

36:54.740 --> 36:56.108
Lock up for me, will you?

36:56.142 --> 36:57.375
Will do.

36:57.409 --> 36:59.912
Haven't you ever noticed how
much you scare the customers?

36:59.946 --> 37:02.148
All right, no,
I do not scare the customers.

37:02.181 --> 37:05.550
- Where are the customers?
- Yeah, that's on me.

37:05.584 --> 37:09.822
Wouldn't go so far as to say
you scare the customers, but...

37:27.206 --> 37:29.809
So this is it?

37:29.842 --> 37:31.711
Hi.

37:31.744 --> 37:33.478
You really spend
your afternoons here?

37:33.511 --> 37:35.181
No, it's quaint.

37:35.214 --> 37:36.916
An honest to God record store.

37:36.949 --> 37:38.951
You should have DJs come in
for competitions.

37:38.985 --> 37:40.953
We should.

37:40.987 --> 37:44.090
You could have all this music
on a laptop or a phone.

37:44.123 --> 37:45.825
Well, most people come in here
because they like

37:45.858 --> 37:48.060
the tactile experience of vinyl.

37:49.996 --> 37:52.698
Still, if you hadn't turned down
that reality show,

37:52.732 --> 37:55.101
you wouldn't have to be here.

37:55.134 --> 37:56.936
You never told us
about a reality show.

37:56.969 --> 37:59.805
- Yeah!
- Oh, busted!

37:59.839 --> 38:01.107
Your secret's out.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.574
Can you see this guy
with a camera crew

38:02.607 --> 38:04.176
following him around everywhere?

38:04.210 --> 38:06.012
Please, my worst nightmare.

38:06.045 --> 38:09.649
So, do you get, like,
commission for selling

38:09.682 --> 38:11.951
these collector's items
or something?

38:11.984 --> 38:14.552
No, no, no, no, not this guy.

38:14.586 --> 38:16.454
See, he doesn't even
actually work here.

38:16.488 --> 38:17.823
He makes a fortune selling

38:17.857 --> 38:20.693
his exotic used porn
collection online.

38:20.726 --> 38:22.695
I don't have
an exotic porn collection.

38:22.728 --> 38:24.496
Oh, a real playa.

38:24.529 --> 38:27.133
No, I, I don't have
any porn collection.

38:27.166 --> 38:28.901
Don't be modest,
tell 'em about it.

38:35.274 --> 38:36.742
That was mean.

38:36.776 --> 38:39.577
I was trying
to help the guy out.

38:39.611 --> 38:42.648
Listen, I gave you an opening,
you should've rolled with it.

38:42.682 --> 38:44.984
Right, and how am I
supposed to roll with you

38:45.017 --> 38:47.720
making me sound like
a total perv?

38:47.753 --> 38:50.222
You just gotta be
less bottled up.

38:50.256 --> 38:52.124
You should've,
should've went over there

38:52.158 --> 38:54.260
and been like,
"Hey, let me show you, uh..."

38:54.293 --> 38:57.229
Wait, what is it what you say?

38:57.263 --> 39:00.833
It's uh, "Let me show you what
the tactile experience

39:00.866 --> 39:02.534
of vinyl's all about."

39:02.567 --> 39:04.937
Oh, your vintage soul collection

39:04.971 --> 39:07.773
is making me feel
strangely flustered.

39:10.142 --> 39:12.278
Those chicks would've
been totally into that.

39:12.311 --> 39:14.512
Bottled up?

39:14.546 --> 39:17.615
So are they your new fan club?

39:17.650 --> 39:21.120
Well, it's... girls like that
are why I need you in my life.

39:21.153 --> 39:23.856
So how's your photographer
friend these days?

39:23.889 --> 39:25.891
Who, you mean Erin?

39:25.925 --> 39:27.827
You'd know her name
better than I would.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.628
I don't know, she's around.

39:29.662 --> 39:30.997
She's around?

39:31.030 --> 39:31.931
- Where?
- What?

39:31.964 --> 39:34.633
- I don't belong to her.
- Is she behind me?

39:34.667 --> 39:37.703
- You wanna meet her?
- Love to meet her.

39:46.578 --> 39:48.280
Bottled up.

39:51.217 --> 39:52.818
Bottled up.

39:55.821 --> 39:59.557
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on, hold on, slow down.

39:59.591 --> 40:02.661
I... hold on, give me a second.

40:04.263 --> 40:07.233
Did we sell anybody a record
named Ass Spatter?

40:07.266 --> 40:08.667
It's a 'epinoymous, '
it means that

40:08.701 --> 40:10.636
the album was the same
as the band name.

40:10.669 --> 40:12.338
You mean it was eponymous.

40:12.371 --> 40:13.906
I don't know, I've only read it.

40:13.939 --> 40:15.207
Besides, how do you know?

40:15.241 --> 40:16.809
- Kidding.
- Okay, well,

40:16.842 --> 40:19.678
he keeps ranting about
Ass Spatter, okay?

40:19.712 --> 40:22.181
Thought it was some dude
with Tourettes prank calling us.

40:22.214 --> 40:24.350
- So what's he want?
- He says we swindled him.

40:24.383 --> 40:26.018
Oh.

40:26.052 --> 40:28.020
Dude needs to smoke a joint.

40:28.054 --> 40:30.622
Dude, we let you in on
the ground floor of Ass Spatter

40:30.656 --> 40:33.659
and now you wanna wimp out?

40:33.692 --> 40:34.994
Okay, you said that you wanted

40:35.027 --> 40:36.796
to be part
of a real underground.

40:36.829 --> 40:39.832
Well, now you are.

40:39.865 --> 40:41.801
Yeah, yeah, you know

40:41.834 --> 40:46.005
there were only 500 copies
of that record made.

40:46.038 --> 40:49.708
Exactly, you're part
of a vanguard.

40:49.742 --> 40:52.678
Do us proud, dude.

40:52.711 --> 40:55.081
Well, call me crazy
but I think your talents

40:55.114 --> 40:57.817
are under-used around here.

40:57.850 --> 41:00.386
You don't think he's gonna
come back with a gun, do you?

41:00.419 --> 41:02.655
Hey, man, what's so...

41:02.688 --> 41:04.890
what, what?

41:04.924 --> 41:06.258
You've gotta be kidding me!
Shit!

41:09.428 --> 41:10.763
I should go see what's up.

41:10.796 --> 41:12.364
No, no, no, let her go.

41:17.069 --> 41:19.004
Goddamnit.

41:19.038 --> 41:21.006
Goddamnit!

41:21.040 --> 41:22.842
Hey.

41:22.875 --> 41:24.110
What's wrong?

41:25.444 --> 41:27.213
My guitarist quit.

41:27.246 --> 41:28.214
Kyle.

41:29.315 --> 41:30.282
I'm sorry.

41:32.151 --> 41:33.352
Is that it for the band?

41:33.385 --> 41:35.821
I don't know.

41:35.855 --> 41:36.889
Maybe.

41:39.225 --> 41:40.659
Probably.

41:42.328 --> 41:45.064
He was really good.

41:45.097 --> 41:46.899
No kidding.

41:46.932 --> 41:51.937
I waited years
to meet a guy like him.

41:51.971 --> 41:55.040
Do you know how rare it is
to meet someone

41:55.074 --> 41:56.876
with their own sound,

41:56.909 --> 41:58.878
someone who doesn't sound
like anybody else?

41:58.911 --> 42:02.781
I mean, people don't stop
and listen to me when I sing,

42:02.815 --> 42:04.683
but they do for him.

42:04.717 --> 42:07.086
They shut up and they put down
their phones when he plays.

42:07.119 --> 42:08.721
No, it's you as well.

42:08.754 --> 42:11.824
No, it's me with him.

42:11.857 --> 42:14.059
He makes everybody
he plays with sound better.

42:15.761 --> 42:19.165
You know, I turn 28 this year.

42:19.198 --> 42:21.934
I turned down a reality TV gig
for this band.

42:21.967 --> 42:23.969
Why'd you turn that down?

42:24.003 --> 42:25.304
Dude, seriously?

42:30.042 --> 42:32.278
I didn't want Kyle to think
I was hedging my bets.

42:32.311 --> 42:33.913
You'll find another guy.

42:33.946 --> 42:37.249
Do you know how hard it is
to find a real guitar player?

42:37.283 --> 42:38.384
In LA?

42:38.417 --> 42:39.718
I mean, they're everywhere.

42:39.752 --> 42:41.287
- Just...
- From now on,

42:41.320 --> 42:43.122
I'm gonna have everyone
telling me,

42:43.155 --> 42:45.090
"Hey, listen to this kid.

42:45.124 --> 42:46.458
He sounds just like Jack White."

42:46.492 --> 42:47.893
"Meet this guy.

42:47.927 --> 42:50.095
He's gonna be
the next Jack White."

42:50.129 --> 42:52.765
I'm gonna audition 30 people,

42:52.798 --> 42:54.867
and they're all gonna sound
like Jack White,

42:54.900 --> 42:56.168
except they don't have talent

42:56.202 --> 42:57.269
and they don't have charisma!

43:02.241 --> 43:03.742
Shouldn't someone be up front?

43:03.776 --> 43:05.911
Like, in case
any customers come in?

43:05.945 --> 43:07.179
Good one.

43:07.213 --> 43:10.382
So why is Kyle leaving?

43:10.416 --> 43:13.285
His girlfriend is
moving to Austin

43:13.319 --> 43:15.354
for grad school
and he wants to be with her.

43:17.223 --> 43:20.025
I was lining up a gig
at South by Southwest,

43:20.059 --> 43:22.795
and now he's moving to Austin.

43:22.828 --> 43:24.396
That's serious irony.

43:24.430 --> 43:26.999
Hey, don't you have a blog
to work on or something?

43:27.032 --> 43:28.234
Come on, man.

43:28.267 --> 43:30.436
I mean, is losing this guy
really that bad?

43:30.469 --> 43:33.005
Besides, the electric guitar
is a tired instrument.

43:34.873 --> 43:38.544
That's like saying the voice
is a tired instrument.

43:38.577 --> 43:40.980
It's a tired instrument
until somebody comes along

43:41.013 --> 43:43.749
and plays and blows you away
with what he can do.

43:49.955 --> 43:51.023
What?

43:59.398 --> 44:03.168
Every conversation he's in,
he's just so loud.

44:03.202 --> 44:05.337
He just fills all the space.

44:05.371 --> 44:08.574
But he's good looking,
so, eh...

44:08.607 --> 44:10.309
Oh, come on.

44:10.342 --> 44:13.979
As if looks are
some kind of novelty in LA.

44:14.013 --> 44:15.147
What did you move here for

44:15.180 --> 44:16.915
if you can't deal
with guys like that?

44:16.949 --> 44:18.817
Seriously.

44:18.851 --> 44:21.520
Look, the girls love Chris

44:21.553 --> 44:23.889
because he's passionate
about something.

44:23.922 --> 44:25.891
Now what are you
passionate about?

44:25.924 --> 44:28.460
- Lots of things.
- Besides 180 gram

44:28.494 --> 44:30.863
vinyl reissues.

44:30.896 --> 44:32.931
I'm not a Nick Hornby
character, you know.

44:32.965 --> 44:34.133
I never said you were.

44:34.166 --> 44:38.404
Look, what you care about
is all up here.

44:38.437 --> 44:40.105
But no one can see what it is.

44:42.007 --> 44:44.310
We can't read your mind.

44:44.343 --> 44:46.512
Now drop the barriers.

44:46.545 --> 44:48.113
You've gotta open up.

44:59.124 --> 45:02.561
Fire. Fire is what people want.

45:02.594 --> 45:05.030
No offense, but you spend
the whole time

45:05.064 --> 45:09.034
just walking around
coolly disdainful.

45:09.068 --> 45:12.438
Fine, you might meet a girl
who's the same way.

45:12.471 --> 45:14.239
Do you think she'll wear
those cool cat-eye glasses?

45:14.273 --> 45:16.208
'Cause I am a big fan.

45:16.241 --> 45:18.577
But she will never
show you passion,

45:18.610 --> 45:21.580
because you never show her
the passion.

45:23.182 --> 45:25.117
You don't take a risk.

45:30.089 --> 45:31.390
Who knows?

45:31.423 --> 45:33.592
You may be very happy together.

45:34.626 --> 45:36.562
Bloody idiot.

45:45.705 --> 45:48.140
Look, dude, seriously.

45:48.173 --> 45:50.576
Don't go to
the District Attorney's office.

45:57.449 --> 45:59.151
No, just think about it.

45:59.184 --> 46:00.486
You walk into the D.A.'s office

46:00.519 --> 46:03.422
with a record
that says "Ass Spatter" on it.

46:03.455 --> 46:05.391
You could get arrested.

46:12.632 --> 46:15.334
You want me to audition
a guy named Shade.

46:15.367 --> 46:17.202
Shade is his name.

46:17.236 --> 46:18.937
No first name, no last name,

46:18.971 --> 46:21.507
I just address him as "Shade"?

46:21.540 --> 46:23.575
No, you don't want me
to go "Mr. Shade," right?

46:23.609 --> 46:24.576
Just...

46:26.378 --> 46:27.513
Oh, yeah.

46:27.546 --> 46:28.414
I bet he's great.

46:28.447 --> 46:30.549
I think he is going to be
the best guy

46:30.582 --> 46:33.085
that we have available, huh?

46:33.118 --> 46:34.253
Sure.

48:01.273 --> 48:04.309
Amazing how shit
would sell in the '90s.

48:05.477 --> 48:07.647
CDs would just go on forever.

48:09.749 --> 48:13.318
One good track, 14 shit ones.

48:13.352 --> 48:18.457
Right around 2000, I knew
our moment was gone forever.

48:18.490 --> 48:21.159
Change in the zeitgeist?

48:21.193 --> 48:24.631
People just didn't want to buy
overpriced CDs anymore.

48:24.664 --> 48:26.565
Plus the wife left,

48:26.598 --> 48:28.735
the store went tits up
in a ditch.

48:28.768 --> 48:31.671
You guys, quit being morbid.

48:31.704 --> 48:33.840
We're not being morbid.

48:33.873 --> 48:37.075
We're just doing
some cultural archaeology.

48:38.577 --> 48:40.112
You guys want to get lunch?

48:40.145 --> 48:41.380
Chris can man
the battle station.

48:41.413 --> 48:42.649
Go on.

48:45.250 --> 48:47.219
So you think we're morbid, huh?

48:47.252 --> 48:50.622
Yeah. Yeah, you guys want
to read the tea leaves

48:50.657 --> 48:53.559
into every dopey-ass song
that comes on the radio.

48:55.227 --> 48:56.863
Well...

48:56.896 --> 48:58.263
Well, I'm glad
I have you in my life

48:58.297 --> 49:00.098
to debunk my pretensions.

49:00.132 --> 49:02.702
Aww, everybody needs someone
to take the piss.

49:05.337 --> 49:09.341
Actually, I'm just glad
I have you in my life, period.

49:12.544 --> 49:16.515
Well, thanks.

49:16.548 --> 49:20.586
You know, I don't think you know
how much you mean to me.

49:25.524 --> 49:27.593
Come on, don't tell me
you haven't felt it.

49:29.829 --> 49:31.163
Felt what?

49:33.332 --> 49:35.702
You know, the...

49:35.735 --> 49:38.838
the vibe
when we're working together.

49:38.871 --> 49:40.907
It's fun!

49:40.940 --> 49:43.175
A little playful,

49:43.208 --> 49:46.111
a little tense.

49:47.947 --> 49:52.685
I just thought maybe
we should go deeper with it.

49:52.719 --> 49:56.288
You know, take it
to the next level.

49:56.321 --> 49:58.223
Wait, hold on,
I'm mixing metaphors now.

49:58.256 --> 50:00.492
- I mean...
- Things are fun between us

50:00.525 --> 50:02.895
because they're not tense.

50:02.929 --> 50:05.464
You're my pal.

50:05.497 --> 50:06.833
I want to feel
like you have my back

50:06.866 --> 50:10.937
when goofballs come in
and they start hitting on me.

50:10.970 --> 50:12.839
Lysette, could I have
a word with you?

50:12.872 --> 50:15.340
- Yeah.
- Am I interrupting anything?

50:15.374 --> 50:16.575
No.

50:26.451 --> 50:28.788
Lysette, I need
to tell you something.

50:28.821 --> 50:30.890
You don't have
a crush on me, do you?

50:30.923 --> 50:32.925
- Me?
- Sorry.

50:34.559 --> 50:35.862
You know, why didn't...

50:38.230 --> 50:40.633
"Deeper with it," Jesus Christ.

50:40.667 --> 50:44.503
Jesus f...
what the hell was that?

50:44.536 --> 50:46.739
Look, you've been here
the longest,

50:46.773 --> 50:49.909
so I thought you should be
the first to know.

50:49.942 --> 50:53.478
The meetings I had with
the loan officer at the bank

50:53.512 --> 50:55.414
didn't pan out.

50:55.447 --> 50:57.750
I couldn't point to anything
to say business

50:57.784 --> 50:59.886
is gonna pick up here
anytime soon.

51:01.420 --> 51:02.387
I'm sorry, but I'm out of...

51:02.421 --> 51:04.389
You know what?

51:04.423 --> 51:06.826
I do have things
that move me in my life.

51:06.859 --> 51:09.729
All right, things that stir
my innermost being.

51:16.002 --> 51:18.370
And I'm not radioactive!

51:21.808 --> 51:23.241
Why are you being
such a freak?

51:33.418 --> 51:36.588
So glad I'm not
in my 20s anymore.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.528
Hey!

51:43.562 --> 51:46.032
Hey, man, hold on.

51:46.065 --> 51:47.633
What is your deal?

51:47.667 --> 51:49.534
You're being a jerk!

51:49.568 --> 51:51.369
That's great,
I'm being the jerk?

51:51.403 --> 51:52.872
What is this,
the world turned inside out?

51:52.905 --> 51:54.306
Listen, man, when I told you

51:54.339 --> 51:55.775
you were being
too needy around women,

51:55.808 --> 51:57.677
I was doing you a favor.

51:57.710 --> 52:00.378
Yeah, thanks a lot for that,
I really appreciate it.

52:00.412 --> 52:01.881
You're so magnanimous.

52:03.448 --> 52:05.017
God, "magnanimous,"
it means that...

52:05.051 --> 52:07.519
I know what magnanimous means,
dickhead!

52:07.552 --> 52:08.654
Yeah!

52:08.688 --> 52:10.255
Kick his ass!

52:13.592 --> 52:15.527
What is it with you, huh?

52:15.560 --> 52:17.462
Is it so hard to believe
that a girl could be fond of you

52:17.496 --> 52:18.865
without wanting to do you?

52:18.898 --> 52:20.599
You're accusing me?

52:20.633 --> 52:22.367
I respect woman, all right?

52:22.400 --> 52:23.836
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
you respect women

52:23.870 --> 52:25.838
in all those fantasies
of yours, no doubt.

52:25.872 --> 52:27.940
My fantasies
aren't the issue here!

52:32.477 --> 52:35.447
Listen, all I'm saying
is that this is the real world.

52:35.480 --> 52:38.583
Why can't you just be happy
with what you have with Lysette?

52:38.617 --> 52:40.519
What are you even talking about?

52:40.552 --> 52:41.954
She cares about you.

52:41.988 --> 52:44.891
Why can't you appreciate that
for what it is?

52:44.924 --> 52:48.426
What are you,
the death metal Dr. Phil now?

52:51.731 --> 52:54.066
Do you ever stop being clever?

52:54.100 --> 52:55.868
Where is it getting you?

53:05.778 --> 53:07.379
What was that guy's deal?

53:10.549 --> 53:11.651
Oh, my God.

54:02.668 --> 54:03.501
Hey.

54:03.535 --> 54:04.637
Look, you guys,
before you say anything,

54:04.670 --> 54:07.505
I'm really sorry about
the whole temper tantrum thing.

54:07.539 --> 54:08.941
I swear that'll
never happen again.

54:08.975 --> 54:10.643
We're closing.

54:10.676 --> 54:11.944
Okay, cool.

54:11.978 --> 54:13.813
Well, I can stick around
and lock up then,

54:13.846 --> 54:14.747
if you guys want.

54:14.780 --> 54:19.752
No, man, like closing
for good, closing.

54:19.785 --> 54:23.689
We haven't come even close
to making our lease in months.

54:23.723 --> 54:26.625
What? What about
the record store day?

54:26.659 --> 54:28.928
I mean, we had the guy
buy a Noy box set

54:28.961 --> 54:30.763
for 250 bucks alone.

54:30.796 --> 54:34.066
One day doesn't make up
for the entire year, does it?

54:34.100 --> 54:36.534
If you recall,
I used that 250 bucks

54:36.568 --> 54:38.603
to take you all out to dinner.

54:38.638 --> 54:40.673
I knew we were screwed
even then.

54:40.706 --> 54:42.742
I knew this day was coming.

54:42.775 --> 54:44.710
Ever since that
old Latina lady came in

54:44.744 --> 54:46.679
and she was looking
for the Taylor Swift album

54:46.712 --> 54:50.049
for her granddaughter,
and we didn't have it.

54:50.082 --> 54:52.785
That day was like an avalanche
of bad karma, wasn't it?

54:52.818 --> 54:54.586
Yeah.

54:54.619 --> 54:57.156
Now, I don't want any of you
getting sentimental.

54:57.189 --> 54:59.491
No tears.

54:59.524 --> 55:01.027
What are you looking at me for?

55:01.060 --> 55:03.863
This place had a decent run.

55:03.896 --> 55:06.564
I knew the days of
the record stores were numbered

55:06.598 --> 55:08.466
even when I opened the place.

55:10.136 --> 55:11.569
To Essential Music.

55:11.603 --> 55:12.838
Hear, hear.

55:28.553 --> 55:31.257
Think of it as a relief.

55:31.290 --> 55:33.192
No more sitting here
wondering when

55:33.225 --> 55:35.560
the next Japanese collector
of our dreams

55:35.593 --> 55:38.130
is gonna walk
through that door,

55:38.164 --> 55:42.001
whip out his Black
American Express card.

55:42.034 --> 55:44.637
Oh, well, I am glad
you're over that,

55:44.670 --> 55:48.040
because we have never taken
American Express.

55:48.074 --> 55:49.942
You have a point.

55:49.976 --> 55:51.110
Seriously, though,
I know it's early,

55:51.143 --> 55:54.246
but have you considered
what you're gonna do next?

55:54.280 --> 55:55.915
Well, look, I've done
the Lower Haight,

55:55.948 --> 55:57.149
I've done Silver Lake.

55:57.183 --> 55:58.651
What should I do, keep moving?

55:58.684 --> 56:02.121
Open up shop in more
and more edgier locations?

56:02.154 --> 56:04.090
I hear there's
a record store vacuum

56:04.123 --> 56:06.158
happening in Juárez right now.

56:06.192 --> 56:09.028
No, it's time for me
to stand up

56:09.061 --> 56:12.631
and embrace the monster
that is the World Wide Web.

56:14.066 --> 56:16.769
I'm gonna sell stuff online.

56:16.802 --> 56:17.903
Good luck with that.

56:19.672 --> 56:21.874
Wait, so that's why you had us
doing inventory.

56:21.907 --> 56:24.243
Yeah.

56:24.276 --> 56:25.311
Seriously, can you imagine

56:25.344 --> 56:27.913
another five years
of this place?

56:27.947 --> 56:30.750
Me telling
the same old war stories

56:30.783 --> 56:32.584
to a bunch of kids
who have no idea

56:32.617 --> 56:34.120
what I'm talking about.

56:34.153 --> 56:36.889
Oh, my God, I feel like it's
finally starting to sink in.

56:36.922 --> 56:39.325
- What is?
- That I might never

56:39.358 --> 56:41.660
have conversations
where people say things

56:41.694 --> 56:44.630
like, "Warmed-Over Krautrock"
ever again.

56:44.663 --> 56:47.933
Is that really
such a bad thing?

56:47.967 --> 56:50.936
Look, you guys, I'm sorry
about the meltdown earlier...

56:50.970 --> 56:51.971
Forget about it.

56:53.906 --> 56:55.641
You guys know I'd crawl
through 10 miles

56:55.674 --> 56:57.176
of broken glass for you, right?

56:57.209 --> 56:59.111
Oh, yeah. Never doubted it.

57:01.080 --> 57:03.049
Freak.

57:03.082 --> 57:05.684
So, if we stay open
until Sunday,

57:05.718 --> 57:09.021
will that be enough
for you to make your rent?

57:09.055 --> 57:11.791
Yes. Thank you.

57:11.824 --> 57:14.326
It's not about
prolonging the death throes.

57:14.360 --> 57:18.731
I say stay open at the weekend,
let a few people in

57:18.764 --> 57:20.933
to pick over the stock,
you know, experts.

57:20.966 --> 57:22.034
Yeah, vultures.

57:22.068 --> 57:25.171
Now we've got to wring out
every dollar, right?

57:25.204 --> 57:28.074
Exactly.
And I'll tell you what.

57:28.107 --> 57:30.643
If Ass Spatter guy calls again,

57:30.676 --> 57:33.946
tell him to come back Monday,
we'll give him a full refund.

57:33.979 --> 57:34.980
Perfect!

57:35.014 --> 57:37.950
I still can't believe
he got away with that.

57:37.983 --> 57:38.918
My proudest moment.

57:47.393 --> 57:49.627
It might be all right.

57:49.662 --> 57:51.263
I mean, come on,
selling that collection,

57:51.297 --> 57:56.635
that could be like a steady
trickle of income.

57:56.669 --> 57:58.237
I don't know, man,
I feel like we were watching

57:58.270 --> 58:00.873
an Academy Award performance.

58:00.906 --> 58:02.208
What do you mean?

58:02.241 --> 58:04.944
You couldn't tell?

58:04.977 --> 58:08.347
He obviously didn't want us
to see how bummed out he was.

58:10.316 --> 58:13.152
You all right?

58:13.185 --> 58:14.353
He didn't want us to know

58:14.386 --> 58:16.122
he's been losing money
for months.

58:17.890 --> 58:20.326
How did I miss that?

58:41.147 --> 58:42.715
A lot of drama, huh?

58:42.748 --> 58:43.883
Yeah.

58:45.417 --> 58:46.919
Thank you for the ride home.

58:46.952 --> 58:47.920
Of course.

58:55.761 --> 58:57.196
We'll make the last
couple days fun, huh?

59:00.733 --> 59:02.301
Make sure this guy
gets home all right.

59:02.334 --> 59:04.136
Oh, I'll do my best,
but you know this guy.

59:04.170 --> 59:05.871
He's a wild man.

59:06.839 --> 59:07.806
Yeah.

59:14.813 --> 59:16.849
Hey, Lys, hold up.

59:16.882 --> 59:19.185
Hey.

59:19.218 --> 59:21.287
Hey, look, I'm sorry
if I put you on the spot

59:21.320 --> 59:22.855
earlier today.

59:22.888 --> 59:23.989
Thank you.

59:29.128 --> 59:32.231
- Duane.
- Yeah?

59:32.264 --> 59:35.434
You know we would make
a terrible couple, don't you?

59:37.236 --> 59:38.737
Terrible?

59:40.139 --> 59:41.373
Why?

59:41.407 --> 59:42.408
Because I don't know
what I want

59:42.441 --> 59:44.443
and neither do you.

59:44.476 --> 59:46.879
- I don't what?
- What?

59:46.912 --> 59:48.113
I mean, I don't know
what I want

59:48.147 --> 59:49.982
- or I don't know what you want?
- Both!

59:56.388 --> 59:57.189
You're right.

01:00:00.559 --> 01:00:02.861
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

01:00:22.481 --> 01:00:23.916
Nailed it.

01:00:26.852 --> 01:00:31.090
Is it possible that
I just know completely nothing

01:00:31.123 --> 01:00:32.458
about women?

01:00:47.439 --> 01:00:49.241
It's not the end of the world.

01:00:50.943 --> 01:00:55.447
Yeah, well,
it really feels like it to me.

01:00:55.481 --> 01:00:57.383
And that's exactly
why I'm gonna be there Sunday

01:00:57.416 --> 01:00:59.918
when you say goodbye, all right?

01:00:59.952 --> 01:01:03.122
You know, just so you don't
do anything stupid.

01:01:03.155 --> 01:01:05.257
Great.

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:07.926
And since when
did I become your project?

01:01:16.035 --> 01:01:18.904
Did you actually want Lysette?

01:01:18.937 --> 01:01:20.472
Or were you just...

01:01:22.207 --> 01:01:23.575
I don't know.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.945
What do you mean?

01:01:26.979 --> 01:01:29.448
No offense, but it seems
like you don't have

01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:30.516
a whole lot of positive things

01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:32.584
going on in your life
right now.

01:01:32.618 --> 01:01:36.055
Well, considering
all the other women in my life

01:01:36.088 --> 01:01:37.990
are on my album covers...

01:01:38.023 --> 01:01:40.959
Okay, promise me
you are not gonna go home,

01:01:40.993 --> 01:01:42.394
stay up all night,
and have a pity party

01:01:42.428 --> 01:01:44.196
with all your music.

01:01:44.229 --> 01:01:46.098
You just think
I'm some dumb college kid,

01:01:46.131 --> 01:01:48.434
don't you?

01:01:48.467 --> 01:01:51.904
Seriously, do yourself a favor,
no pity parties,

01:01:51.937 --> 01:01:53.572
no drowning
in your sorrows, okay?

01:01:53.605 --> 01:01:56.608
Dude, we don't even have
any alcohol in the apartment.

01:02:00.045 --> 01:02:02.448
Which is not to say

01:02:02.481 --> 01:02:07.019
there might not be a moment
of mature reflection

01:02:07.052 --> 01:02:11.223
with some sensitive
musical accompaniment.

01:02:13.092 --> 01:02:13.992
Goodnight, dude.

01:02:58.705 --> 01:03:00.539
My friends always
ask about you.

01:03:00.572 --> 01:03:04.309
I think they thought
you were my mid-life crisis.

01:03:04.343 --> 01:03:07.579
Can't think why.

01:03:07.613 --> 01:03:09.948
It's that thing you got
on your head, Walt.

01:03:09.982 --> 01:03:11.383
Well, if it's good enough
for Keith,

01:03:11.417 --> 01:03:12.719
it's good enough for me.

01:03:12.752 --> 01:03:14.153
Keith?

01:03:14.186 --> 01:03:15.587
Never mind.

01:03:19.191 --> 01:03:20.959
I'm sorry to hear
about the store.

01:03:20.993 --> 01:03:21.994
Oh.

01:03:23.663 --> 01:03:25.665
Alexis, if you could see
what some of these kids

01:03:25.698 --> 01:03:28.033
are doing out there
in Silver Lake and Echo Park,

01:03:28.066 --> 01:03:29.234
it would blow your mind.

01:03:29.268 --> 01:03:32.371
They've got record stores
with art galleries in the back,

01:03:32.404 --> 01:03:35.607
recording studios, cafes.

01:03:35.642 --> 01:03:37.242
I can't compete with that.

01:03:37.276 --> 01:03:40.045
- What happened?
- It's me.

01:03:40.078 --> 01:03:42.381
I'm just not
feeling it anymore.

01:03:42.414 --> 01:03:45.652
I've lost me mojo, man.

01:03:49.689 --> 01:03:53.525
I used to get
this incredible buzz from music.

01:03:53.559 --> 01:03:55.994
I'd read all the music press.

01:03:56.028 --> 01:03:59.465
If there was an obscure zine,
I would know it.

01:03:59.498 --> 01:04:01.233
I'd read about some band

01:04:01.266 --> 01:04:05.204
whose records
you couldn't even find.

01:04:05.237 --> 01:04:07.005
And I'd just spend days

01:04:07.039 --> 01:04:10.509
imagining what
they would sound like.

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:13.078
The indie bands,
the little indie labels,

01:04:13.111 --> 01:04:14.613
it was like poetry to me.

01:04:16.649 --> 01:04:19.051
But now when I flip
through a music magazine,

01:04:19.084 --> 01:04:23.555
it's like a foreign language
that I don't speak anymore.

01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:26.291
It's a load of gibberish.

01:04:26.325 --> 01:04:28.327
Did I just sound
incredibly middle-aged

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.729
- saying all that?
- Well, it was bound

01:04:29.762 --> 01:04:31.396
to happen sometime, Walt.

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:33.532
I always thought
I was immune somehow.

01:04:33.565 --> 01:04:36.401
I can't believe there's gonna be
no more Essential Music.

01:04:36.435 --> 01:04:37.569
I mean, in my life,
there have been

01:04:37.603 --> 01:04:41.106
three record stores:
Wallichs Music City,

01:04:41.139 --> 01:04:43.442
Tower on Sunset,
your place.

01:04:43.475 --> 01:04:46.813
Now music is just something
I listen to on the computer.

01:04:46.846 --> 01:04:49.615
Well, there you have it.

01:04:49.649 --> 01:04:51.149
I bet I drove you crazy

01:04:51.183 --> 01:04:54.219
all the time I spent
in the store, didn't I?

01:04:54.253 --> 01:04:56.823
Well, I couldn't drag you
out of there.

01:04:56.856 --> 01:04:59.324
You had your office set up
like a man cave

01:04:59.358 --> 01:05:01.193
before man caves
were the thing.

01:05:01.226 --> 01:05:03.562
Forgive me?

01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:06.231
So what are you gonna do?

01:05:06.265 --> 01:05:09.201
I think it's time yours truly
got a Hollywood gig.

01:05:09.234 --> 01:05:10.335
Hmm.

01:05:10.369 --> 01:05:11.671
So any time
they're making movies

01:05:11.704 --> 01:05:16.308
set between 1975 and 2005,

01:05:16.341 --> 01:05:18.343
let me be the one
who picks the songs for it.

01:05:18.377 --> 01:05:19.578
Nice!

01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:21.246
You've been
saving yourself up for that.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.849
My fee will be very reasonable,

01:05:22.882 --> 01:05:25.217
a low six-figure sum.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:27.286
Do you ever think
of moving back to England?

01:05:27.319 --> 01:05:28.788
England?

01:05:28.821 --> 01:05:32.257
Last time I was in England,
John Major was Prime Minister.

01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:34.192
- Who?
- I rest my case.

01:05:35.662 --> 01:05:37.496
So seriously,
what are you gonna do?

01:05:37.529 --> 01:05:39.231
Alexis, what is
all this questioning?

01:05:39.264 --> 01:05:40.700
It's like the ex-wife.

01:05:42.367 --> 01:05:44.469
What am I gonna do?

01:05:44.503 --> 01:05:47.239
In the immortal words
of the great Joe Strummer...

01:05:50.843 --> 01:05:51.844
Who the fuck knows?

01:05:53.746 --> 01:05:54.714
Do you want money, Walt?

01:05:57.149 --> 01:05:58.483
Me?

01:06:12.932 --> 01:06:14.366
Duane's Blog.

01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:27.412
Duane's Super Music Power Hour.

01:06:31.383 --> 01:06:36.588
Duane's Ass-Kicking,
Blog-a-tastic...

01:06:36.622 --> 01:06:42.695
Duane's Ass-Kicking,
Subgenre to Mainstream...

01:06:49.969 --> 01:06:51.403
Duane's Blog.

01:07:15.327 --> 01:07:16.896
This looks like
quite the project.

01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:20.967
You wouldn't believe the shit
I've been finding in here.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.268
Do you even remember those?

01:07:23.301 --> 01:07:25.672
- Cassette single?
- Yeah.

01:07:25.705 --> 01:07:27.406
It looks like it should be
played on a toy or something.

01:07:30.643 --> 01:07:32.912
One more format
that fell by the wayside.

01:07:32.945 --> 01:07:34.613
Yeah.

01:07:34.647 --> 01:07:36.581
It really is the end of days.

01:07:36.615 --> 01:07:40.519
Ah, now you're both here,
I've got something for you.

01:07:40.552 --> 01:07:42.187
Don't spend it all at once.

01:07:44.957 --> 01:07:47.592
Probably won't be getting
one of these for a while.

01:07:47.626 --> 01:07:49.829
Probably use it
to buy some new CDs.

01:07:49.862 --> 01:07:50.897
You guys know of any place

01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:52.431
that's got
some rock bottom prices?

01:07:52.464 --> 01:07:54.634
No, don't do that.

01:07:54.667 --> 01:07:57.202
We've got something
for you, ready?

01:07:58.971 --> 01:08:01.708
Thought you could use
some cheering up.

01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:03.375
We figured it was
the one thing in the store

01:08:03.408 --> 01:08:04.977
you'd most appreciate.

01:08:06.746 --> 01:08:08.648
Well, thanks for
looking out for me, you guys.

01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:10.215
Don't mention it.

01:08:13.753 --> 01:08:14.887
Would you like
some free coasters?

01:08:20.325 --> 01:08:22.729
Somebody took
all the psych albums?

01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:24.796
Well, a couple of dealers
came by and sniffed out

01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:27.566
the best stuff
in about three minutes flat.

01:08:27.599 --> 01:08:28.835
- Sorry.
- What do you got going on

01:08:28.868 --> 01:08:30.737
after this whole last hurrah?

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:33.438
Jeanine and I got a gig.

01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:34.439
We're gonna be working on sets

01:08:34.473 --> 01:08:36.709
up at the Santa Maria
Shakespeare Festival.

01:08:36.743 --> 01:08:38.577
That is awesome!

01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:40.046
A nice coastal town,
get you out of LA

01:08:40.078 --> 01:08:43.348
- for the summer.
- Exactly!

01:08:43.381 --> 01:08:44.817
I'm so excited to be away

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:47.252
from 99-seat
black box theaters for a while.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.890
You'll have to let me know
when that goes on.

01:08:50.923 --> 01:08:52.058
I'll make sure to check it out.

01:08:52.091 --> 01:08:54.794
You know, it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world

01:08:54.827 --> 01:08:57.261
for you to get out
of this place.

01:08:58.698 --> 01:08:59.531
Right.

01:08:59.564 --> 01:09:01.067
Wait, what's that?

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.502
You're running out
on Ass Spatter guy?

01:09:03.535 --> 01:09:06.671
Yeah, I don't think things
are gonna work out between us.

01:09:06.706 --> 01:09:08.573
Too bad. He seemed
like the kind of guy

01:09:08.607 --> 01:09:10.575
who's probably
carving your name

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:11.911
into his chest right now.

01:09:14.578 --> 01:09:16.783
I'm so happy
you finally met someone.

01:09:16.816 --> 01:09:18.350
Oh, both you guys,

01:09:18.383 --> 01:09:20.051
we're having a party
a week from Saturday,

01:09:20.086 --> 01:09:23.055
and I really hope you can come.

01:09:23.089 --> 01:09:24.622
Walt, you gonna be there?

01:09:24.657 --> 01:09:26.558
Yeah, I might make it.

01:09:26.591 --> 01:09:28.493
Not sure I can handle
the new dynamic

01:09:28.527 --> 01:09:30.428
where you guys
don't work for me anymore.

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:34.000
Seriously, I would love
to see you there.

01:09:34.033 --> 01:09:35.533
We're hoping that Duane
might hold forth

01:09:35.567 --> 01:09:37.069
for a few hours.

01:09:37.103 --> 01:09:39.504
How can I say no to that?

01:09:39.537 --> 01:09:41.406
It's a deal, we'll be there!

01:09:43.575 --> 01:09:44.810
All right, well, uh...

01:09:46.545 --> 01:09:47.647
See you later!

01:09:49.447 --> 01:09:52.484
And Walt, please,
don't let me down!

01:09:52.517 --> 01:09:54.352
You'll be seeing me, man.

01:09:54.386 --> 01:09:56.055
A year from now,
Duane and me will be fighting

01:09:56.088 --> 01:09:58.523
over who's gonna work
your merch table.

01:09:58.557 --> 01:10:00.492
Oh, my God.

01:10:00.525 --> 01:10:02.427
Please don't even joke
about that.

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:05.031
Yeah, I need
to get out of here now.

01:10:05.064 --> 01:10:06.699
I'll see you soon.

01:10:19.511 --> 01:10:22.114
Promise me you're not gonna
obsess about that party.

01:10:22.148 --> 01:10:24.050
Man, figuring out how
I'm gonna pay rent this month

01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:26.085
has pushed all of that
to the side, believe me.

01:10:27.119 --> 01:10:28.721
So what's next for you?

01:10:28.754 --> 01:10:30.890
Oh, I didn't tell you.

01:10:30.923 --> 01:10:34.426
The band is down
to me and the bassist.

01:10:34.459 --> 01:10:37.495
- What happened?
- Everyone's bailing.

01:10:37.529 --> 01:10:41.600
Drummer quit to go play drums
for a Mexican goth band.

01:10:41.634 --> 01:10:42.467
Huh.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.937
It's like last week
I was fronting

01:10:44.971 --> 01:10:46.504
this amazing rock army,

01:10:46.538 --> 01:10:49.942
and this week
we're just a roots outfit.

01:10:51.043 --> 01:10:53.478
I don't know, man.

01:10:53.511 --> 01:10:55.580
Strike another match,
go start anew.

01:10:56.481 --> 01:10:58.617
What?

01:10:58.651 --> 01:11:00.385
Nothing, Dylan line.

01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:04.422
Hey, I was thinking,
you should really

01:11:04.456 --> 01:11:05.825
start that blog or something.

01:11:05.858 --> 01:11:07.525
Like, you know a lot
about music,

01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:09.494
and you know
how to turn a phrase.

01:11:09.527 --> 01:11:12.131
- You may as well.
- Thanks.

01:11:12.164 --> 01:11:14.466
I don't know, I mean,
it's such a cliché, though.

01:11:14.499 --> 01:11:16.702
It's not a cliché
if you're doing it.

01:11:16.736 --> 01:11:20.706
I mean, what's that famous quote
by that chick?

01:11:22.241 --> 01:11:23.809
Martha Graham.

01:11:23.843 --> 01:11:25.878
Seriously,
it's that famous quote

01:11:25.912 --> 01:11:28.014
where she's like,
"If you have something special

01:11:28.047 --> 01:11:30.615
to bring in this world,
it's your duty to bring it out

01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:32.985
because nobody else has it."

01:11:33.019 --> 01:11:35.487
That could be you
and your music knowledge.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.489
You're quoting Martha Graham?

01:11:38.925 --> 01:11:39.959
Who are you?

01:11:39.992 --> 01:11:41.459
I had a vocal coach
in high school

01:11:41.493 --> 01:11:43.729
I remembered it from.

01:11:43.763 --> 01:11:46.198
This chick, by the way,
was totally into me.

01:11:47.767 --> 01:11:48.701
Well, I never forgot it.

01:11:48.734 --> 01:11:50.036
You should check it out.

01:11:50.069 --> 01:11:51.603
I will.

01:11:51.637 --> 01:11:52.838
Thanks, I appreciate it.

01:11:59.544 --> 01:12:00.846
Wait, you took vocal lessons?

01:12:03.548 --> 01:12:06.252
Yes, not very rock and roll,
I know.

01:12:06.285 --> 01:12:09.121
Let's just say
that's my dirty little secret.

01:12:09.155 --> 01:12:12.091
Literally in every
high school musical.

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.561
♪ Could it be?
Yes, it could ♪

01:12:16.594 --> 01:12:19.098
♪ Something's coming,
something good ♪

01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:22.268
♪ Long as I wait ♪

01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:25.237
♪ Something's coming,

01:12:25.271 --> 01:12:29.709
♪ But it is gonna be great ♪

01:13:39.145 --> 01:13:40.746
Yeah, I like it.

01:13:46.018 --> 01:13:47.853
Do you need some help?

01:13:47.887 --> 01:13:49.587
No, I'm fine.

01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:51.257
You could handle
the last minute rush.

01:13:56.628 --> 01:13:59.832
Shouldn't it be your fan club
broken up about this?

01:13:59.865 --> 01:14:00.666
Not you?

01:14:02.768 --> 01:14:04.770
You weren't planning
on a secret career

01:14:04.804 --> 01:14:05.905
in retailing, were you?

01:14:05.938 --> 01:14:08.140
No. Nope.

01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:13.746
It's just, you know,
I've been working here

01:14:13.779 --> 01:14:14.980
for a year and a half,

01:14:15.014 --> 01:14:19.385
and it just... it occurred to me

01:14:19.418 --> 01:14:23.689
that the type of work
that I want to do,

01:14:23.722 --> 01:14:26.192
it's always going to be
a temporary situation.

01:14:29.395 --> 01:14:30.930
At least you'll meet new people.

01:14:32.098 --> 01:14:33.799
Yeah, but I'm really...

01:14:33.833 --> 01:14:36.001
I'm really gonna miss
the old ones.

01:14:55.221 --> 01:14:56.188
Right.

01:17:44.123 --> 01:17:45.457
Fuck, man.

01:17:45.491 --> 01:17:46.925
Dammit.

01:21:40.192 --> 01:21:42.361
Why? Please!

01:21:42.394 --> 01:21:45.430
You'll love jazz-country fusion,
it's the best!

01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:51.651
