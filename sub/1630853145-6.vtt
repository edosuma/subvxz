00:16.015 --> 00:18.918
<i> Poulet au Porto is one</i>
<i>of my favorite dishes.</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:20.920
<i>This is an excellent recipe</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:22.822
<i>to make for your</i>
<i>nearest and dearest,</i>

00:22.889 --> 00:26.226
<i>as it cannot be prepared</i>
<i>ahead of time.</i>

00:26.326 --> 00:28.995
<i>Instead, I suggest you invite</i>
<i>those lucky ones</i>

00:29.062 --> 00:31.731
<i>into your kitchen</i>
<i>for dinner and a show.</i>

00:31.831 --> 00:34.267
Oh, missed opportunity.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.903
I should've used the chicken
like a puppet.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.105
It was right there
for the taking.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.408
<i>And now I'm going to pop</i>
<i>the mushrooms</i>

00:41.508 --> 00:44.277
<i>into the pan for a good sweat.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:47.347
<i>Speaking of which...</i>

00:50.550 --> 00:51.851
Oh, my God.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.387
Oh, really, Russ?
Is it the chicken?

00:54.454 --> 00:56.956
See, the technique
is too similar to coq au vin.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.359
It's good to repeat techniques.
That's how people learn.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.261
Well, they don't learn
if they're bored.

01:01.361 --> 01:02.896
I'm not bored.
I'm exhausted.

01:02.962 --> 01:04.230
The baby.

01:04.297 --> 01:05.932
Oh, yes.

01:06.032 --> 01:08.601
The little bundle of joy.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.203
Two weeks
and barely a wink.

01:10.270 --> 01:14.374
It's an evolutionary misstep to
come into the world so hungry.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.309
Alright, I'm sorry.
I have to cut this short.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.144
But if I sit in a dark room
any longer,

01:18.244 --> 01:19.879
I'm gonna fall asleep
on your shoulder.

01:19.946 --> 01:21.147
Ah.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.316
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
No, let -- let me.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.319
This is my favorite part.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.754
Um...

01:27.821 --> 01:29.656
Is there a problem,
Charlie?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.330
Oh, no.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.665
There's a wrinkle.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.000
Excuse me?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.569
I'm right here,
Russ!

01:42.635 --> 01:44.471
Not you, Julia.
The tape.

01:44.571 --> 01:46.439
Oh.

01:46.506 --> 01:47.774
There's a wrinkle
in the tape.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.577
Oh, well, that's a relief.

01:52.345 --> 01:53.813
What's a wrinkle
in the tape?

01:53.913 --> 01:56.850
A wrinkle in the tape
is tantamount to lost film.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.319
And unfortunately, it runs
through so much of the film

01:59.419 --> 02:01.421
that the episode
is unsalvageable.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.323
We're gonna need to do
a total reshoot.

02:03.423 --> 02:06.926
Well, if we must do it again,
we will do it with aplomb.

02:06.993 --> 02:08.995
What good fortune that
we're taking the week off.

02:09.095 --> 02:12.265
It's a perfect chance
to recharge our tired batteries

02:12.332 --> 02:13.867
and --
and come back --

02:13.967 --> 02:16.302
You just looked
at each other.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.004
Why have you looked
at each other?

02:18.104 --> 02:19.973
There can't be
a week off.

02:20.039 --> 02:21.674
But there<i> is</i> a week off.

02:21.774 --> 02:25.812
I marked it in very bold letters
in my diary.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.313
"Week off."

02:27.380 --> 02:30.316
The deal with KQED
is for continuous programming.

02:30.383 --> 02:32.218
We've just syndicated
to three other cities.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.020
If we take a week off
and then reshoot,

02:34.120 --> 02:35.522
we'll be two weeks
behind.

02:35.622 --> 02:36.689
Our hands are tied.

02:36.789 --> 02:39.192
Well, hands can be untied,
Alice.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.727
I'm exhausted.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.129
Actually,<i> I'm</i> exhausted,
and I'm okay with it.

02:43.196 --> 02:44.898
It's not a competition, Russ.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.067
I just need a little bit of time
to catch my breath.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.669
I hear you,
but if you think about it,

02:49.736 --> 02:51.171
it's an enviable
position.

02:51.237 --> 02:52.739
No one wants a break
from Julia.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.909
I could use a break
from Julia.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.314
Oh, it's an enviable position,
Simca.

03:01.381 --> 03:04.250
It was, uh, no small feat
on Judith's part to get

03:04.350 --> 03:06.819
"Mastering, Part II"
back in motion.

03:06.886 --> 03:09.055
I sent you the recipe
for cassoulet, no?

03:09.155 --> 03:11.824
Yes, I know, dear, and while
it's a wonderful start --

03:11.891 --> 03:15.261
Well, it's not the beginning.
It's, uh, finished.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.865
Well, I mean, it's a wonderful
start to the mountain of work

03:18.932 --> 03:21.401
we still need to do.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.736
Meaning?

03:23.836 --> 03:24.737
Bread.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.272
No, no, no, no, no.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.774
Julia, no, no.

03:27.874 --> 03:28.942
Bread? No.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.376
Now, hear me out.

03:30.443 --> 03:33.947
The French don't
make bread.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.282
Well, I beg to differ
because I have had

03:36.382 --> 03:40.019
some of the most beautiful
baguettes whilst in France.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.422
I mean,
the French housewives.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.358
The French housewives
do not make bread.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.960
You know what I mean.
Don't be cute.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.295
I'm being clever, not cute,
and really,

03:49.395 --> 03:52.365
it's just ghastly here
between the Wonder Bread

03:52.432 --> 03:54.300
and the hot dog buns,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.736
and ooh,
we need to help, Simca.

03:56.803 --> 03:58.705
You help.
Me? No.

03:58.771 --> 04:01.241
Yes, but I'm a bit tied up
this week

04:01.307 --> 04:02.475
with "The French Chef."

04:02.575 --> 04:06.212
Why do you call it
"The French Chef," huh?

04:06.279 --> 04:07.413
You're not French.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.649
Well, because I cook
French food,

04:09.749 --> 04:12.151
and while I continue
to bring the message

04:12.252 --> 04:15.755
of French food to America,
as was our mission,

04:15.822 --> 04:19.325
I would like to offer you
the privilege of spearheading

04:19.425 --> 04:21.661
the baguette recipe
yourself.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.563
<i>C'est impossible.</i>

04:23.630 --> 04:24.731
No, it's not impossible.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.834
You just don't want
to do it.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.669
<i>Exactement.</i>

04:29.769 --> 04:32.338
And I sent you cassoulet.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.741
But I didn't ask
for cassoulet!

04:34.807 --> 04:37.510
I am not your employee.

04:37.610 --> 04:41.247
Call me when you want
to do something French!

04:42.615 --> 04:44.150
Eh --

04:48.855 --> 04:50.356
Paul!

04:51.691 --> 04:53.459
Paul!

04:53.526 --> 04:55.328
Wait.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.530
Oh, Paul,
it was a disaster.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.867
What --

05:00.967 --> 05:02.101
I was afraid of that.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.370
Simca's always been a bull
about bread.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.672
Now, what am I gonna do?

05:05.772 --> 05:07.206
Judith's on the train
as we speak.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.876
She's taken vacation days just
to work on the bread chapter.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.377
Alright, alright,
deep breaths, my love.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.113
It'll be fine.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.815
Because you can
do anything.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.685
You are the woman who enchanted
America with her cooking show,

05:18.785 --> 05:20.453
and in so doing,
created so much demand

05:20.520 --> 05:22.789
that they're all clamoring for
the second volume of your book.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.557
Yes, but I don't have
the ability

05:24.657 --> 05:26.359
to be in two places
at once,

05:26.459 --> 05:28.861
and the book won't get
published without bread.

05:28.961 --> 05:31.864
No.
But you have help.

05:31.964 --> 05:36.736
I will skip Judo and we'll
crack a schedule together,

05:36.836 --> 05:38.371
because nothing
can't be fixed

05:38.471 --> 05:40.740
with some good old-fashioned
time management.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.008
Oh. Yes.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.683
Oh, Judith!
You're drenched!

05:50.750 --> 05:51.918
Just a bit damp.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.319
Come in. Come in.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.855
It took me a minute to catch
a cab at the station.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.857
That'll teach me
to forget my umbrella.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.426
Oh, these damned
August showers.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.229
Let's hope it's dry skies
for the rest of the week.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.164
'Cause you know what
doesn't love rain?

06:05.231 --> 06:08.101
Bread.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.769
I'm beyond excited to be

06:09.869 --> 06:12.105
on the front lines
of your process.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.107
I never get to watch
my clients in motion.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.377
Although, to be fair,
their work is rarely so tactile.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.778
Ooh!

06:18.878 --> 06:22.081
What a treat to get to be
in the trenches with you.

06:22.181 --> 06:23.449
Yes, about that.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.119
Do I have a surprise for you.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.854
Ta-da!

06:28.888 --> 06:29.922
Well, hey, Paul.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.457
Well, you may know him
as Paul,

06:31.557 --> 06:35.128
but he is also
your partner.

06:36.462 --> 06:39.132
Your partner in bread.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.268
The truth is, this week
is all turned upside down.

06:42.368 --> 06:45.304
Suffice to say, I do not have
this week off as planned.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.875
Mm. And, uh, when we sat down
to work out a schedule,

06:48.941 --> 06:50.810
we realized there,
practically speaking,

06:50.910 --> 06:52.612
were not enough hours
in the day

06:52.712 --> 06:54.714
and not enough Julias
to go around.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.216
Which it turns out is
a happy problem indeed.

06:57.283 --> 06:58.618
How so?

06:58.718 --> 07:00.153
Paul?

07:00.253 --> 07:03.656
Paul is much better suited
to the task of cracking bread.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.091
Bread is scientific.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.292
Now, I'm a lot of things,

07:06.392 --> 07:09.228
but scientific
is not one of them.

07:09.295 --> 07:10.663
I dare say
I would've enjoyed

07:10.763 --> 07:13.132
dissecting the frog
in biology class much more

07:13.232 --> 07:17.403
if I'd known I could sauté
the legs in butter and garlic.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.238
Sounds like you've
worked it all out.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.274
May we offer you
some dinner?

07:21.340 --> 07:24.477
We could discuss the pros
and cons of American flour.

07:24.577 --> 07:27.013
I have thoughts.

07:27.113 --> 07:31.117
As nice as that sounds,
I-I actually ate on the train.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.019
And I'm drenched.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.087
Uh, would you mind
if I retire to my room?

07:35.154 --> 07:37.023
Oh, of course.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.992
A good night's rest
for the week ahead.

07:53.039 --> 07:55.975
What time is too early
to start?

07:56.042 --> 07:57.143
5:00 a.m.?

07:57.210 --> 07:59.178
Let's be eager,
but humane.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.113
5:30 it is.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.149
However, I don't know
if I'll even be able to sleep.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.552
I'm so excited.

08:06.652 --> 08:10.223
Oh, that's wonderful,
Paulski.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.792
Oh, to be inspired.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.127
Julie?

08:15.194 --> 08:16.963
Well, of all the episodes
to reshoot,

08:17.029 --> 08:19.966
Poulet au Porto would not
have been my top choice.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.134
But you adore
Poulet au Porto.

08:22.201 --> 08:24.570
Yes, but did you realize
that of the last 12 episodes,

08:24.670 --> 08:26.072
four of them
have been chicken?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.908
Chicken is a wonderfully
versatile ingredient.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.146
Simca accused me of
not being French enough.

08:34.213 --> 08:37.717
Simca wouldn't exist
outside of her own ego

08:37.817 --> 08:38.918
if it weren't for you.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.820
Yes, but I mean,
there's French food

08:40.887 --> 08:42.822
and then there's
<i>French</i> food.

08:42.889 --> 08:46.225
Uh-oh.
Do I see wheels turning?

08:46.325 --> 08:51.497
Well, I just can't see the point
in doing a bad job twice.

08:51.564 --> 08:55.668
See, maybe I have
the authority to...

08:55.735 --> 08:57.436
change the recipe?

08:57.537 --> 09:00.773
Last time I checked,
it was your show.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.275
Yes, it is my show.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.276
Ha!

09:25.965 --> 09:28.267
That's five minutes.
Squats, Paul.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.805
Oh, good morning,
<i>ma chere amie.</i>

09:32.905 --> 09:34.640
Would you care
to join?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.976
Limber up the muscles
for the knead ahead.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.412
Before my coffee?

09:39.478 --> 09:40.780
No.

09:42.915 --> 09:43.983
How much longer?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.285
Do you want me
to fudge it?

09:47.219 --> 09:48.654
Yes.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.057
Let's stretch.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.960
I admit, I was a bit miffed
at red-faced little Vickie

09:54.060 --> 09:56.395
at first,
all that crying.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.764
The stamina on those
tiny lungs.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.666
How is Marian doing?

10:00.766 --> 10:02.268
Marian?

10:02.335 --> 10:04.337
Oh.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.605
Fine.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.673
Goo-goo ga-ga for baby.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.409
What was I talking about?

10:10.476 --> 10:11.911
Not sleeping, I think.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.245
Yes!

10:13.312 --> 10:16.849
In other words,
productivity.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.685
Once you realize there's
no point in even trying,

10:19.785 --> 10:21.921
that's when you get
to the good part.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.924
Which brings me
to your part.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.192
My part?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.694
I need you step up
on "The French Chef."

10:28.794 --> 10:30.496
Take more responsibility.

10:30.596 --> 10:31.964
Wow. Really?

10:32.031 --> 10:33.366
I-I would be thrilled.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.335
Anything you need to lighten
the load, get some more rest.

10:36.435 --> 10:37.870
Al!

10:37.970 --> 10:39.505
I'm not tired!

10:39.605 --> 10:43.275
What you see here -- this is
a broadening of my portfolio.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.711
The San Francisco trip
taught me two things.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.280
I need to make shows
which are my passion.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.449
You mean like
"The Advocates"?

10:50.516 --> 10:51.617
Eventually.

10:51.684 --> 10:54.286
And what's the second thing?

10:56.989 --> 10:59.325
You said there were
two things.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.128
I did. Yes.

11:02.194 --> 11:03.896
That "The French Chef"
is a big deal

11:03.996 --> 11:07.199
and I need to use that
to my advantage.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.335
Well, that's great, Russ,
but "The French Chef"

11:09.402 --> 11:11.537
also needs us on set
in five.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.708
Vinnie. Hi.

11:15.808 --> 11:18.077
- Hi.
- Um, can you go through this --

11:18.177 --> 11:19.412
Oh. One second.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.047
Julia!

11:21.147 --> 11:23.582
Always nice to be greeted
with enthusiasm.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.418
Thank you, Roy.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.820
Ooh, me, too.
What are you excited about?

11:27.887 --> 11:30.423
Russ asked me to take
a stronger hand

11:30.523 --> 11:31.757
in the producing
of the episode.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.859
Oh, Alice,
that's marvelous.

11:33.926 --> 11:35.494
Do you approve?

11:35.561 --> 11:37.096
I'm delighted.
Produce away.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.664
Ah.
What are you excited about?

11:38.731 --> 11:40.032
Well, gather the troops,

11:40.099 --> 11:41.834
Madame Producer,
and you shall see.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.703
Excuse me.
Everyone!

11:43.769 --> 11:45.571
Can we gather around
for a moment?

11:45.671 --> 11:47.773
Julia has an announcement.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.777
Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.281
We have a slight
change of plans.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.551
About that --
I can't be here for the episode.

11:58.617 --> 12:00.886
You came here to tell us
you can't be here?

12:00.953 --> 12:03.622
Well, I'm here today,
but tomorrow,

12:03.723 --> 12:05.458
I'm up 95
in Kennebunkport.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.126
I thought we had a break,
so we made plans

12:07.226 --> 12:09.128
to see my parents
at their summer home.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.897
Norman hates my parents,
but he loves lobster rolls,

12:11.964 --> 12:13.466
so I gotta capitalize.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.136
I would never get in the way
of lobster rolls.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.704
We'll make do.

12:18.771 --> 12:20.473
What's<i> your</i> change
in plans?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.474
Yes.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.209
No chicken.

12:23.275 --> 12:26.545
Chicken, my friends,
is tired territory.

12:26.612 --> 12:30.149
This reshoot is an opportunity.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.051
It won't be a reshoot at all.

12:32.118 --> 12:33.719
It will be a new shoot.

12:33.786 --> 12:37.089
We're going to make something
much more French.

12:37.156 --> 12:39.925
Poulet au Porto sounds
pretty French to<i> moi.</i>

12:39.992 --> 12:43.329
Ah, not as French
as the wonderful,

12:43.429 --> 12:46.632
mouthwatering delicacy
of sweetbreads!

12:53.172 --> 12:55.341
While that is
a lovely idea,

12:55.441 --> 12:57.843
we have already done
the shopping.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.012
Oh.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.981
But as I pay
for the groceries,

13:02.081 --> 13:04.683
I'd be more than happy
to pay for new groceries.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.686
But Avis and Dorothy
are in charge of groceries,

13:07.787 --> 13:10.456
and since Dorothy is
no longer available to help --

13:10.523 --> 13:11.757
I can handle it.

13:11.824 --> 13:14.193
Oh, that's the spirit!

13:14.293 --> 13:16.796
But I've only got two hands
and one of them is arthritic,

13:16.862 --> 13:18.364
so I'm gonna need
some help.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.598
Alice?

13:19.665 --> 13:21.934
W-While I'm always ready
to lend a hand,

13:22.001 --> 13:23.135
maybe not on the week

13:23.202 --> 13:25.171
when we can still save
some of the footage.

13:25.271 --> 13:28.474
Oh, but I-I thought the footage
was unsalvageable.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.042
Well, the episode
is unsalvageable,

13:30.142 --> 13:32.678
but some of the footage
could still be useful.

13:32.778 --> 13:36.182
Oh, I hadn't realized.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.517
Julia.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.620
Do you want to do
sweetbreads?

13:41.687 --> 13:45.324
Oh, I do want to do
sweetbreads.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.892
You're the boss!

13:46.992 --> 13:49.962
And the boss sounds
passionate about this one.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.033
Passion is good,
Julia.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.868
No, it really is.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.408
Oh!
You know, it's much more work.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.310
Yes.

14:04.376 --> 14:05.845
Oh.
Well, I can't deny it.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.479
No one will make this dish.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.849
Maybe not, but maybe
one person will.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.318
You will have a script
by tomorrow.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.253
Didn't you just tell me
to take charge?

14:14.353 --> 14:15.588
You<i> are</i> in charge.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.356
In charge
of Julia's vision.

14:17.423 --> 14:20.326
And Julia's vision has led her
to sweetbreads.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.428
Do you know
what sweetbreads are?

14:22.528 --> 14:23.596
No.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.598
Like a danish, right?

14:33.005 --> 14:34.006
Who's next?

14:34.073 --> 14:36.175
Hi.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.576
Over here.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.549
Your basket's empty.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.783
Yes, I'm aware.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.620
I've been trying
to get his attention.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.854
Oh.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.522
Hello! Johnny!

14:50.589 --> 14:52.024
Hi.

14:52.091 --> 14:54.426
Morning, Mrs. DeVoto.
What can I do for you today?

14:54.526 --> 14:55.861
Pays to be pushy.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.464
We're gonna need all
the sweetbreads you've got.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.466
Is Mrs. Child really doing
sweetbreads?

15:00.566 --> 15:03.035
She is, indeed.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.137
I couldn't take another round
of enraged customers.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.474
We almost didn't survive
the run on sole last month.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.909
Really?

15:11.577 --> 15:13.712
If it's alright, I'll help you
drop off the food at Julia's,

15:13.779 --> 15:16.081
but then I have to race
back to the office.

15:16.148 --> 15:17.783
Three sister stations
are wondering

15:17.883 --> 15:19.285
where the new episode is.

15:19.385 --> 15:20.986
Russ may or may not be
on the verge

15:21.086 --> 15:23.889
of an insomnia-induced
nervous breakdown.

15:23.956 --> 15:25.090
Men and sleep.

15:25.157 --> 15:27.826
Yeah, well, I'm happy
to pick up the slack,

15:27.927 --> 15:31.330
but there is a lot
of slack this week.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.299
Strict instructions
from Julia.

15:33.399 --> 15:36.769
You can skedaddle after you
help me prep the sweetbreads.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.604
Prep the sweetbreads?

15:40.806 --> 15:44.677
These babies need to soak
for 24 hours.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.011
Ah.

15:46.111 --> 15:49.348
Apparently, glands are
very high-maintenance.

15:56.855 --> 15:59.425
I think we need to add
some more water.

15:59.491 --> 16:03.362
Though that may be true, we must
follow the scientific method.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.031
If we don't have a constant
by which to compare,

16:06.131 --> 16:08.867
we'll be nowhere
as we begin to experiment.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.203
Monsieur Calvel's recipe
is our North Star.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.139
Be that as it may,
we're working to a deadline.

16:14.206 --> 16:18.544
So, perhaps we can make
some calculated accelerations.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.846
Ah, but bread rushes
for no one.

16:20.946 --> 16:23.215
I'm not sure Blanche Knopf
would agree with that.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.719
Well, then, we have to seduce
her with the joy of process.

16:26.819 --> 16:27.720
Mm.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.288
The vigor of the knead.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.623
The suspense of the proof.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.625
The catharsis of the slash.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.194
Watch that vigor, Paul.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.129
You're liable to give yourself
a hernia.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.197
W-W-Wait - The --

16:38.297 --> 16:40.065
The kitchen is closed
for business.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.235
We are the business, baby.
Television trumps cookbook.

16:43.335 --> 16:46.205
Well, just --
just don't touch anything.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.908
Wh--

16:51.310 --> 16:53.212
Watch it, pal.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.263
Ah -- Oh!

17:11.363 --> 17:14.433
Oh, very nice.
Very nice.

17:21.073 --> 17:22.274
Oh!

17:22.374 --> 17:24.009
Oh, I need some air.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.745
Oh, don't you dare destroy
this wonderful humidity!

17:26.845 --> 17:28.614
It smells like
pancreas, Paul.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.050
Be reasonable.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.951
Oh, for God's sake.

17:43.128 --> 17:44.430
Oh.
Alice, you got this?

17:44.530 --> 17:46.031
No, a-actually,
I really have to --

17:46.098 --> 17:47.633
You're a doll!

17:48.901 --> 17:50.436
Paul's trying
to recreate

17:50.536 --> 17:53.272
a professional
baker's oven in here.

17:53.372 --> 17:56.108
This heatwave is a --
is a gift from Hestia.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.479
The Greek maiden goddess
of the hearth.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.481
Apparently,
she's with us.

18:02.581 --> 18:06.485
Hm, is there a Greek
maiden goddess of glands?

18:06.585 --> 18:08.654
'Cause I could use
her help.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.499
Time for a break?

18:23.168 --> 18:25.504
For you
and a cool glass?

18:25.604 --> 18:26.905
Always.

18:26.972 --> 18:29.842
I snuck in a drop of gin.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.009
Ooh.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.078
Gosh, this heatwave
is dreadful.

18:33.145 --> 18:36.081
Paul's in
proofing heaven.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.417
He's babysitting the dough
as we speak.

18:38.484 --> 18:41.019
I think there's a metaphor
about a watched pot

18:41.120 --> 18:42.521
he should consider.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.157
I have watched my husband
watch paint dry.

18:45.257 --> 18:46.692
It's one of
the many reasons

18:46.792 --> 18:50.195
I knew he'd bring
the right energy to bread.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.798
Because he's meticulous.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.334
Yes.

18:55.434 --> 18:58.971
But he's also not you.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.840
The recipe needs
that Julia touch.

19:01.940 --> 19:05.477
I know that Blanche Knopf
wants what she wants.

19:05.544 --> 19:10.549
So I promise to touch it up
and down and all around.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.318
Paul is a brilliant man.

19:13.385 --> 19:18.824
But he's not exactly known
for his accessible thinking.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.392
You mean he's a snob?

19:20.492 --> 19:22.794
We're all snobs.
It's not a judgment.

19:22.861 --> 19:28.133
But your gift is one
of translation.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.236
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,
Judith, but...

19:31.336 --> 19:36.542
you are actually a very
well qualified translator.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.077
I translate French,
not French bread.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.245
And I'm not a writer.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.014
Ooh, that's mere details.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.916
You didn't come all this way
just to watch.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.418
No, I came all this way
to spend some time with you.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.520
Goodness knows I could
have vacationed in Montauk

19:48.587 --> 19:50.389
like a normal New Yorker.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.997
Yes, well,
I-I'm disappointed, too.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.101
And it's your vacation.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.504
You deserve to spend it
as you want.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.442
So, if you need to go,
I understand.

20:15.747 --> 20:20.118
The cuts of sweetbread
come from these glands

20:20.219 --> 20:21.553
right at the base of the neck,

20:21.620 --> 20:25.090
which are wonderfully
aromatic and delicate.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.359
I thought
she was doing donuts.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.228
Maybe she's just gonna
turn them into donuts.

20:29.294 --> 20:33.699
And sweetbreads also come
from another surprising source.

20:33.765 --> 20:35.367
Any guesses?

20:36.702 --> 20:38.070
Are we supposed to guess?

20:38.136 --> 20:39.938
No, that was
a dramatic pause.

20:40.038 --> 20:41.640
Maybe a little less
dramatic.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.975
Yes, roger that.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.978
It's something that helps
to aid in digestion,

20:46.078 --> 20:49.815
and now I'm going to encourage
you to digest it yourself.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.950
It's the pancreas!

20:52.050 --> 20:53.051
Oh, Russ.

20:56.088 --> 20:56.989
Russ!

20:57.089 --> 20:58.957
Present!

20:59.057 --> 21:02.628
Could we use our mirror to show
the fascinating process

21:02.728 --> 21:05.998
of separating the two lobes
from the tube?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.901
Benny.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.937
What the lady wants,
the lady gets.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.839
And I need to keep it
in focus?

21:19.144 --> 21:23.849
Now, just grab those
pre-soaked lobes...

21:23.949 --> 21:25.183
No. God no.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.853
I did not sign up
for sweetbreads in close-up.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.256
Oh, dear!
We had a casualty.

21:32.658 --> 21:35.527
I got it.

21:35.627 --> 21:40.799
We want to really relish
ripping these membranes apart.

21:53.378 --> 21:55.514
I'm still not sure about
the flour proportions.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.983
Shh!
They'll hear you.

22:01.553 --> 22:03.722
No!

22:03.822 --> 22:06.158
We peeked last time,
and look what happened --

22:06.224 --> 22:09.328
pale, insipid crust.

22:09.394 --> 22:11.163
Sit.

22:20.806 --> 22:24.710
My only fear
is failing her.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.714
Then we won't.

22:32.718 --> 22:33.919
Together?

22:34.019 --> 22:35.320
Yeah.

22:51.436 --> 22:54.606
Ah --

22:54.706 --> 22:56.608
She's a whizz at knitting.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.111
I've got a closet full
of sweaters I never wear

22:59.211 --> 23:00.412
to prove it.

23:00.512 --> 23:03.281
Wow.
These'll be great.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.084
Perfect for this
August heat wave.

23:06.184 --> 23:07.452
You look tired.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.388
You sleeping?

23:09.454 --> 23:10.689
Actually, I'm great.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.457
Never been more focused.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.127
I know you're busy,
so I'll get to it.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.696
I want to make
a weekly news program

23:17.763 --> 23:19.197
that focuses
on civil rights

23:19.264 --> 23:21.266
and social justice issues
in this country.

23:21.366 --> 23:24.469
I have Morgenthau, uh, making
a documentary about that.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.905
Y-Yes, but a documentary
is a one-off.

23:26.972 --> 23:29.274
This issue is evolving,
volatile.

23:29.374 --> 23:32.411
We need a program
that can respond in real time.

23:32.477 --> 23:35.313
I'll mention it to Morgenthau.
Hm.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.549
No, Hunter, I'm your guy.

23:37.616 --> 23:38.984
Mm...yeah.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.485
You are my guy.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.454
My guy for
"The French Chef."

23:42.554 --> 23:46.625
Well, that, uh, shot
with the mirror -- genius.

23:46.725 --> 23:49.594
No one can do that
like you.

23:49.661 --> 23:52.764
But what do you have to say
about this civil rights thing

23:52.831 --> 23:55.133
that other people
can't say?

23:56.601 --> 23:58.403
In fact,
I called this meeting --

23:58.470 --> 23:59.638
<i>I</i> called this meeting.

23:59.738 --> 24:02.174
...to talk about doing
more home shows

24:02.274 --> 24:03.575
for our lady viewers.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.444
Apparently, there are
a lot of them.

24:05.510 --> 24:06.645
Who knew?

24:06.745 --> 24:08.513
Maybe a knitting show
with my sister-in-law.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.116
Uh --

24:11.183 --> 24:13.952
but you know, yarn is...

24:14.019 --> 24:16.488
Well, I don't know.
You'll figure it out.

24:16.588 --> 24:18.957
I'd like to do something
that matters.

24:19.024 --> 24:20.325
To whom?

24:20.425 --> 24:23.962
"The French Chef" matters
to a whole lot of people.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.698
And the only reason Morgenthau
gets to make his documentary

24:26.798 --> 24:30.635
is because "The French Chef"
will pay for it.

24:30.702 --> 24:34.706
So, really, you<i> are</i> working
on civil rights.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.343
Feel better?

24:40.378 --> 24:41.947
Sorry for the mess.

24:42.013 --> 24:43.849
I don't usually
have visitors.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.717
I'm usually
the one summoned.

24:45.817 --> 24:48.220
Have I been summoned?

24:48.320 --> 24:50.355
Oh, no.
No, I just wanted to talk.

24:50.455 --> 24:53.058
To check in,
see how you were feeling.

24:53.158 --> 24:57.195
Well, I'll feel better
once we move onto crepes.

24:57.295 --> 24:58.697
Yes. About that.

24:58.797 --> 25:01.900
Uh, the future episodes are
what I wanted to talk about.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.902
Oh.
So, I have been summoned.

25:04.002 --> 25:08.573
Well, the fact of the matter is
that the show is a huge success.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.408
Uh-huh.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.645
and with that has come the
saving grace of a real budget.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.981
Money makes the world
go 'round.

25:16.047 --> 25:17.582
We've been doing so much
with so little,

25:17.682 --> 25:19.150
but it turns out
we can now afford to hire

25:19.217 --> 25:22.220
a production assistant.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.055
What's a production
assistant?

25:24.155 --> 25:25.924
Oh, uh, someone
who can be responsible

25:26.024 --> 25:28.527
for grocery shopping,
um, food prep,

25:28.593 --> 25:31.930
an extra pair of hands
behind the counter for Julia.

25:32.030 --> 25:36.501
You mean you can hire someone
to be me?

25:36.568 --> 25:38.937
I can -- I can hire someone
to lessen the burden

25:39.037 --> 25:41.106
on you and Dorothy.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.741
You're firing me.

25:42.841 --> 25:45.110
I can't fire you.
You're a volunteer.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.745
Please don't get the wrong
end of the stick.

25:46.845 --> 25:48.580
A production assistant
would just free you up

25:48.680 --> 25:50.181
to do the parts you like.

25:50.248 --> 25:52.117
You won't be tied to
the rigorous schedule

25:52.217 --> 25:54.052
of a multi-episode
TV show.

25:54.119 --> 25:56.388
You can flit in and out
as you'd like.

25:56.454 --> 25:58.223
Flit?

25:58.290 --> 26:00.125
I can<i> flit?</i>

26:00.225 --> 26:02.527
Cold, cold, cold.

26:02.594 --> 26:04.262
Moved onto
cocktails?

26:07.132 --> 26:10.302
Paul had the brilliant idea
of ice cubes in the oven

26:10.402 --> 26:12.537
to create more steam
for the crust.

26:12.604 --> 26:15.307
But if the ice doesn't work,
perhaps the reverse --

26:15.407 --> 26:18.944
conducting enough heat
through an object --

26:19.044 --> 26:21.613
Have you tried
brushing water on it?

26:21.713 --> 26:23.582
Yes, that's where
we started.

26:23.648 --> 26:27.252
No, I think the ice cubes
will evaporate too quickly.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.788
Perhaps,
but seems worth a try.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.456
Mm.
Well, the flavor's good.

26:31.556 --> 26:33.625
But the texture's
all wrong.

26:33.725 --> 26:37.062
I'm not sure where crust ends
and bread begins.

26:37.128 --> 26:38.930
We are in process.

26:38.997 --> 26:41.566
Well, your process
is in a very chewy phase.

26:42.968 --> 26:46.605
Um, darling, might I see you
in the pantry

26:46.671 --> 26:50.442
for a quick question
about yeast?

26:50.508 --> 26:51.943
Oh.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.980
This is far too stuffy
an environment to store yeast.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.315
I don't want to talk
about yeast.

26:57.415 --> 26:59.484
You charged us
with an endeavor,

26:59.584 --> 27:01.653
and we deserve time
to get it right.

27:04.122 --> 27:08.360
Yes, I understand that,
but this is my name on it

27:08.460 --> 27:10.362
at the end of the day.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.097
I told you
I'd be checking in.

27:12.163 --> 27:14.866
You told us you'd be available
as needed.

27:14.966 --> 27:18.269
And we do not need you
as of yet.

27:18.336 --> 27:20.138
A little trust, maybe?

27:21.973 --> 27:23.942
But you're not storing yeast
in here, right?

27:24.009 --> 27:25.343
Julia.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.145
I'm leaving.

27:28.847 --> 27:31.149
She actually thinks
she can fire us.

27:31.216 --> 27:33.318
As you and Dorothy
are not employees,

27:33.385 --> 27:35.687
that does seem
rather difficult.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.189
Yeah,
that's what she said.

27:38.289 --> 27:40.125
Why do you think
she wanted to fire you?

27:40.191 --> 27:42.227
I have no idea.

27:42.327 --> 27:47.332
Well, maybe Dorothy because
she skipped town

27:47.399 --> 27:49.134
on a week
when we were shooting.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.969
Well, she may have a point.

27:51.036 --> 27:52.871
And you?

27:52.971 --> 27:56.841
Maybe because I'm too squeamish
to handle the sweetbreads.

27:56.908 --> 28:00.578
Which means that she has to do
all the prepping herself,

28:00.679 --> 28:03.748
in addition to everything
else she does, which...

28:03.848 --> 28:06.518
I imagine
is probably a lot.

28:06.584 --> 28:09.087
She may have a point.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.922
She may have a point.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.257
Chew.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.092
It's calming.

28:23.034 --> 28:26.771
Maybe I'm just old and useless.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.873
You're not old.

28:28.940 --> 28:33.578
And no one has ever called
Avis DeVoto useless.

28:34.946 --> 28:37.449
Silly of me to think
I was important enough

28:37.549 --> 28:39.451
to become a problem.

28:40.552 --> 28:44.055
Did I ever tell you
about my boss in the OSS?

28:44.122 --> 28:48.226
Mr. Earp became
utterly convinced

28:48.293 --> 28:51.463
that he could induce
the Japanese to surrender

28:51.563 --> 28:56.735
by playing on their
supposed fear of foxes.

28:56.801 --> 28:59.237
The State Department
actually allowed him

28:59.304 --> 29:03.041
to dip a thousand of the poor
things in phosphorous

29:03.108 --> 29:05.543
and then release them
into the water

29:05.610 --> 29:07.145
in the hope that
they'd swim to shore

29:07.245 --> 29:09.380
and scare the soldiers
out of their foxholes.

29:09.447 --> 29:12.150
Well, who the hell has
a thousand foxes standing by?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.486
Well, the little beasts
all drowned in the Pacific.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.988
Oh.

29:17.088 --> 29:20.492
But he was in charge,
and so we did it.

29:20.592 --> 29:25.063
How many men have set the rules
and the world didn't fall apart?

29:25.130 --> 29:27.398
Men have unbelievable
confidence

29:27.465 --> 29:29.334
when it comes to making
arbitrary decisions.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.170
They feel totally justified
by the mere fact

29:32.270 --> 29:35.840
that it is their desire
for it to be so.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.342
I envy that.

29:37.442 --> 29:41.346
Well, now<i> I</i> get to make
the decisions.

29:42.313 --> 29:44.983
And you're not even
a terrible idea.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.321
The show is about
French cooking,

29:50.421 --> 29:52.857
so I don't believe
Mrs. Child will be amenable

29:52.957 --> 29:55.193
to a Philly cheesesteak episode,

29:55.293 --> 29:58.363
but I will relay the message.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.632
Alright.
Bye now.

30:03.701 --> 30:05.370
Julia.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.138
Interesting
conversation?

30:07.205 --> 30:11.309
Oh, lots of requests
from our sister stations.

30:11.376 --> 30:14.145
I am learning the art
of the polite put-off.

30:15.847 --> 30:18.383
You know who can't be
politely put off?

30:19.884 --> 30:21.719
My dear friend Avis.

30:24.956 --> 30:27.325
I-I don't know what
she told you, Julia,

30:27.392 --> 30:30.328
but professionalizing the show
is an important step.

30:30.395 --> 30:32.463
Professionalizing
sounds an awful lot

30:32.530 --> 30:35.400
like trying to replace
Avis and Dorothy.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.235
But if it makes
your life easier --

30:37.335 --> 30:40.505
But that wasn't your decision
to make, Alice.

30:40.572 --> 30:43.842
Honestly, I think it was
overstepping on your part.

30:43.908 --> 30:45.577
Um...

30:48.213 --> 30:50.081
Wow.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.749
Sorry.

30:51.850 --> 30:52.917
Oh, dear.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.519
No, this isn't
what it looks like.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.721
Well, it looks like
you're trying not to cry.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.556
No, I'm not going to cry.

30:58.656 --> 31:00.058
I think it might be
too late.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.759
No.
No, I have three older brothers.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.561
You do not cry when you have
three older brothers.

31:03.661 --> 31:04.929
Well, your brothers
aren't here.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.031
Well, maybe I'll pretend
that they are here.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.766
Oh, dear.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.769
I think I may have
hurt your feelings.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.740
I really didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.878
Seem to be rather good
at that at the moment.

31:19.944 --> 31:26.384
Oh, you know, I think
that I-I am just, um...

31:26.451 --> 31:29.287
oh, confused.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.723
Confused about what?

31:31.789 --> 31:33.858
Uh, my job.

31:33.925 --> 31:38.429
I-I love my job, but it --
it lacks a little bit of...

31:39.964 --> 31:41.633
...definition.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.469
I am told to step up
and then to step back,

31:44.569 --> 31:45.904
to make myself
indispensable,

31:45.970 --> 31:48.306
but then suddenly
I've leapt off a cliff and --

31:48.406 --> 31:49.974
I'm so sorry.
I'm<i> so</i> sorry.

31:50.074 --> 31:53.044
This is not
your problem.

31:53.111 --> 31:56.714
I think San Francisco just
gave me some mixed-up ideas.

31:56.781 --> 32:00.151
Why would San Francisco
give you mixed-up ideas?

32:03.821 --> 32:07.392
I sold the show
to San Francisco.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.396
Wait, you did that?

32:11.462 --> 32:13.464
I assumed it was Russ.

32:16.067 --> 32:20.338
You told me to make myself
indispensable, so I did.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.507
But if I've overstepped now,
I apologize.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.509
It won't happen again.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.611
Don't apologize.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.848
I know I can be messy
and impulsive

32:30.949 --> 32:34.452
and seat-of-my-pants,
and that isn't always easy.

32:34.519 --> 32:37.789
But that is
the fact of it.

32:37.855 --> 32:39.857
Avis and Dorothy
made this show happen

32:39.958 --> 32:42.427
when no one but you and I
believed in it,

32:42.493 --> 32:45.797
and I am never
letting them go.

32:45.863 --> 32:48.933
They're family.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.369
I understand.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.471
But you're family, too.

33:06.884 --> 33:08.219
Yeah.

33:40.084 --> 33:41.386
Nah.

34:25.630 --> 34:26.798
Oh.

34:29.033 --> 34:30.935
Oh, you're beautiful.

34:31.035 --> 34:32.970
Oh, we did it!
We did it! We did it!

34:46.951 --> 34:48.252
A toast!

34:48.319 --> 34:51.489
- That's your third toast.
- Yes, it's my third drink.

34:51.589 --> 34:56.094
This one for my darling Paul
and his ingenious breakthrough.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.662
To the asbestos tile.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.064
To the asbestos tile!

35:01.833 --> 35:03.301
Mm!

35:03.401 --> 35:05.670
Honestly, Paul, I don't know how
you come up with these things.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.905
A quick study of thermal
qualities, I guess.

35:07.972 --> 35:09.474
I don't know.

35:09.574 --> 35:15.313
Yes, that asbestos tile was 100%
the brainchild of Paul Child.

35:15.413 --> 35:18.182
Well, I had a very patient
collaborator.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.853
Oh, it's just wonderful
when something works.

35:21.953 --> 35:26.190
Are you getting choked up
over your own grand idea?

35:26.290 --> 35:30.995
Don't be silly.
This shrimp is wonderfully hot.

35:31.095 --> 35:32.530
You should grab a copy

35:32.630 --> 35:35.666
of Joyce Chen's cookbook
before you leave.

35:35.766 --> 35:37.702
It's worth the Peking Duck
recipe alone.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.036
Absolutely.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.706
And you'll appreciate it
all the more now that you're

35:41.806 --> 35:43.674
a cookbook author
yourself.

35:43.774 --> 35:46.511
Ah! One recipe does not
a cookbook author make.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.012
Oh, stop that.

35:48.112 --> 35:50.381
If it were up to me, that recipe
would be 32 pages long.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.517
You achieved culinary poetry.

35:52.617 --> 35:54.452
I couldn't do it.

35:54.519 --> 35:56.888
Food makes me feel
creative.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.223
Mm, mm, mm. Mm!

35:59.323 --> 36:01.225
Not another one, Julia!

36:01.325 --> 36:02.960
- To Judith.
- Mm-hmm.

36:03.027 --> 36:07.064
I can't wait to see the poetry
she makes of brioche.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.200
- Uh-huh.
- Wait.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.068
I'm not doing
the whole chapter.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.737
We'll see.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.807
I demand mint chip.

36:16.874 --> 36:19.911
It's a freezer, dear,
not a Dairy Queen.

36:25.683 --> 36:28.586
Butter pecan for me,
and, um --

36:28.686 --> 36:31.656
Oh, gosh. No.

36:33.991 --> 36:36.394
Ah.

36:36.494 --> 36:37.728
Ohh!

36:37.828 --> 36:41.399
Paul and Judith's boulangerie,
Julia speaking.

36:41.499 --> 36:44.168
Oh, Dort! Hi, Dort.

36:44.235 --> 36:45.570
Why so late?

36:45.670 --> 36:48.573
Dort is Dorothy --
Julia's sister, the youngest.

36:48.673 --> 36:50.541
Taller than Julia,
if you can believe it.

36:54.345 --> 36:55.846
Oh, Dort.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.383
Julia?

37:02.687 --> 37:04.555
Pop died.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.962
His heart gave out.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.630
I'm so sorry.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.869
I'll give you two
some privacy.

37:18.936 --> 37:21.439
Oh, Dort, no.

37:21.539 --> 37:25.643
No, I'll take care
of all of that.

37:25.743 --> 37:26.877
Yes, please
don't worry, pet.

37:26.944 --> 37:29.080
I can call
the funeral home and...

37:31.082 --> 37:32.817
Yes, I don't mind.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.320
Yes, I'll handle it.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.001
He did seem slower.

37:53.437 --> 37:57.141
And I-I didn't think to see him
when we were in San Francisco.

37:57.241 --> 38:00.278
Please don't --
don't do that to yourself.

38:00.344 --> 38:04.315
Well, Pop's the last
of that generation.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.185
I feel a bit
like I built a house

38:08.286 --> 38:11.689
and forgot to include
the roof.

38:18.496 --> 38:22.500
Uh, I'm gonna cancel
the taping tomorrow.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.701
Oh, no, Paul.

38:23.801 --> 38:27.038
People are depending on me.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.939
I should -- I should --

38:29.006 --> 38:31.208
Look at us.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.877
It's 3:00 a.m.

38:38.482 --> 38:41.452
We have got to get
some rest.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.162
Julia.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.236
I love you.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.747
Do you think she's okay?

39:09.847 --> 39:11.649
She looks okay.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.992
Okay, 30 seconds!

39:22.059 --> 39:24.228
Places, please!

39:24.328 --> 39:26.897
Settle in, settle in.

39:26.997 --> 39:30.267
Rolling sound.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.336
Rolling picture.

39:34.772 --> 39:40.044
And we're ready in 5, 4, 3...

39:43.347 --> 39:45.549
Hello, I'm Julia Child.

39:45.616 --> 39:47.051
Today's a special day,

39:47.118 --> 39:50.187
because we're tackling
something particularly French.

39:50.254 --> 39:55.626
They're called sweetbreads, and
they're neither sweet nor bread.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.962
But they are divine.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.965
I have a feeling they may not be
a favorite for many of you,

40:01.065 --> 40:02.533
but they are
a favorite of mine.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.636
And we've come so far
already together,

40:05.736 --> 40:08.472
I'm asking you
to give them a chance.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.941
And you may surprise yourself.

40:11.041 --> 40:13.544
And isn't it nice
to be surprised?

40:16.080 --> 40:18.382
On a personal note,

40:18.449 --> 40:22.620
I'd like to dedicate
this episode to my father.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.922
My father never ate sweetbreads.

40:24.989 --> 40:26.624
He was very picky.

40:26.724 --> 40:30.928
In fact, just the thought of him
eating them makes me smile.

40:30.995 --> 40:34.999
But I am who I am
because of him

40:35.099 --> 40:38.002
and in spite of him.

40:38.102 --> 40:42.673
And so, Pop, this one's for you.

40:44.742 --> 40:46.944
Um, a good show.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.747
Lovely about your father.

40:49.814 --> 40:53.184
But never make
sweetbreads again.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.687
In one week, my wife is going
to recreate your meal,

40:56.787 --> 40:58.355
and I don't want that.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.859
Well, you'll be pleased to know
that next week is tarte tatin.

41:03.194 --> 41:04.361
Apple pie.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.330
Ah! Great.

41:06.430 --> 41:09.633
I won't bore you with numbers
or details,

41:09.700 --> 41:12.436
but the show
is doing very well.

41:12.503 --> 41:14.538
Uh, Scotch?

41:14.638 --> 41:18.042
Uh, sold in four markets,
et cetera, et cetera.

41:18.142 --> 41:22.146
All that means for you
is we'd like to do a season two.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.848
Oh, that's splendid.

41:23.948 --> 41:26.283
Yes, it is.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.619
Glad to hear you're in.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.554
I haven't said I'm in.

41:30.654 --> 41:31.789
Uh -- Mm?

41:31.856 --> 41:35.392
You haven't actually asked me
if I'm in.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.061
I have terms.

41:38.863 --> 41:40.498
We need a couple of breaks
in production

41:40.564 --> 41:43.734
for us to catch our breath
once in a while.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.302
Alright.

41:45.369 --> 41:47.638
And WGBH pays for the food.

41:47.705 --> 41:51.242
Uh, the food
is a significant cost.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.744
Well, I assume these stations
who are buying the show

41:53.844 --> 41:55.579
are doing so with money?

41:57.414 --> 42:00.084
So, that will pay
for the food.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.586
Fine.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.221
Is that all?

42:04.321 --> 42:07.191
No, there's one more thing.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.226
Alice Naman.

42:09.326 --> 42:10.861
Is she a problem?

42:10.928 --> 42:12.730
No, she's a producer.

42:12.830 --> 42:15.866
She should have the title.
Full producer.

42:18.702 --> 42:21.038
Okay, now I'm asking --

42:21.105 --> 42:23.674
Are you in?

42:23.741 --> 42:25.776
To Season Two.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.614
To Season Two.
