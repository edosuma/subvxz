WEBVTT

00:00.835 --> 00:01.966
- After we received your sample,

00:02.003 --> 00:03.702
Our lab conducted an in-depth
analysis of the drug

00:03.837 --> 00:04.903
That you're calling
"purple rain."

00:04.939 --> 00:07.039
- So we're likely looking
for someone

00:07.108 --> 00:08.907
With specialized chemistry
knowledge.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.976
- I imagine at the very least
they have a master's degree,

00:10.978 --> 00:12.644
But probably a phd.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.880
- I first heard about purple
rain at a house party in guelph.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.114
- Michel owens?

00:16.150 --> 00:18.450
- He's got a phd in chemistry,
has access to the lab.

00:18.585 --> 00:19.584
Guelph tech.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.819
- Okay, here's
what I'm thinking.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.388
We take a road trip out
to guelph,

00:22.523 --> 00:23.655
Bump the guy,
see what we find.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.057
Yeah, I'm looking for
michel owens,

00:25.126 --> 00:26.958
The lab manager for
the chemistry department?

00:26.994 --> 00:29.661
- The last time he signed
into the lab was two nights ago
at midnight.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.664
- I'm not making drugs.
I'm not selling drugs.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.968
Have you talked to Tuesday?
- Who's Tuesday?

00:36.103 --> 00:38.303
- The janitor I just had fired
after I caught them

00:38.439 --> 00:40.873
After hours working late
cooking shit up in my lab

00:40.875 --> 00:42.474
And lying about it.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.009
- Did krish put you up
to all this?

00:44.078 --> 00:46.878
- I didn't make purple rain
with the intention of dealing.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.081
I was just trying
to help people.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.617
- Were you trying to help the
people who overdosed and died?

00:51.752 --> 00:55.354
Selfish. That's what my mother
told me every night of my life.

00:55.356 --> 00:58.891
Well, the nights that she was
there, which was barely ever.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.960
- Jenn can be a bit possessive.
- She doesn't want to meet me?

01:02.029 --> 01:03.161
- She...

01:04.965 --> 01:06.765
...Doesn't want to meet you.
I'm sorry.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.402
- Sam, you're home?

01:12.940 --> 01:14.106
Ro!

01:21.582 --> 01:24.249
- Keep your eye on the gps,
I need to turn around at 2.5,

01:24.384 --> 01:26.318
I cannot be late for work today.
- Me neither.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.320
Rumour is goldstein
is retiring next month,

01:28.455 --> 01:30.122
Means they'll be looking for
a new partner.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.124
This time, I'm not gonna
let it get away.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.058
- Nice. Yes!
(chuckling)

01:35.229 --> 01:37.062
- I was sensitivity-trained
twice a week, check.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.997
Gone to every conference,
check.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.932
Taken every file
they've offered, check.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.535
Been mentoring this hot,
young junior, check.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.104
- Uh...
- Okay, 2.5, let's turn around.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.141
- Okay, so who's this hot
young junior?

01:49.143 --> 01:50.709
- Jay burden, new hire.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.078
Clerked at the supreme court,
"whatevs".

01:53.147 --> 01:55.747
- Smart or entitled?
- She's pretty smart, actually.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.417
- Oh, right. Cool.
Jay's a she, that's nice.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.785
- Yeah, she is.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.821
Jay-na. She goes by jay.
Well, some people call her jay.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.156
I do, sometimes.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.091
- How excellent of you
to spend your time mentoring

02:06.226 --> 02:07.959
A young, female,
hot junior lawyer.

02:08.028 --> 02:09.828
- Please don't be weird--
- don't you be weird.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.497
(sighs)
- she's a very talented lawyer.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.166
She's a colleague rising
through the ranks.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.433
I've taken her under my wing.

02:15.435 --> 02:16.835
- Oh, the old proverbial
wing snuggle.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.303
- Sam.
- What?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.839
- Are you serious here?
I thought we were past all this,

02:21.876 --> 02:23.709
But if we're not, I will cease
and desist all mentoring.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.244
- Oh, listen, stop.
You do you, make partner

02:25.379 --> 02:26.778
And then we're gonna celebrate
in greece, okay?

02:26.780 --> 02:27.845
So...
(sighs)

02:27.882 --> 02:29.281
Listen, I don't have time
for petty jealousies.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.748
I'm gonna be late for work.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.618
Move it, slowpoke.
- Ow.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.854
(upbeat music)

02:38.659 --> 02:40.258
- Come on, slowpoke.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.860
- Okay, okay.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.729
- We should have been there
an hour ago.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.064
What is taking you so long?
- Well, what's the rush?

02:46.066 --> 02:48.800
- I'm eager to get there.
- Okay.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.469
- Oh, you're still home...
- Adriana.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.605
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

02:53.740 --> 02:55.974
- Oh, my internet's down. I've
got a few big zoom meetings,

02:56.010 --> 02:57.542
So I was hoping I could
hunker down

02:57.545 --> 02:58.777
While you guys are at work.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.144
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.946
- And I am okay with that.
Here's a key.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.348
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.550
- I am too, but I feel bad,

03:05.553 --> 03:07.019
I'm going to work and
you're just getting here.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.386
- We can hang out later.

03:09.156 --> 03:12.090
(groaning)
- okay.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.161
And bring my niece next time.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.263
- Bye, you two.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.633
Okay.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.636
- So, do you really think
we got all the purple rain

03:24.771 --> 03:26.537
Off the street?
- I don't know about that.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.640
I mean, Tuesday seemed to be
the only one making it.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.908
And if they're off the street,
my feeling...

03:30.945 --> 03:34.779
Purple rain will dry up
pretty soon.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.314
- Wow, right? Oh my gosh.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.916
That deserves a really big
pat on the back.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.251
Turn around, there we go.
- Thank you.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.451
- Bang, bang, bang.
- Turn around.

03:40.487 --> 03:41.653
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.055
- Oh, a bit of a takedown
party maybe.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.690
- I don't mean to brag,
but I can bench-press

03:44.825 --> 03:46.557
My own weight. I could
probably bench-press you.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.727
I've also recently
become a vegan.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.430
- Oh, wow. That is really
impressive, watts.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.733
Oh, man! There you guys are.
I have been looking...

03:54.802 --> 03:57.402
I gotta talk to these gals.
- Oh, sure.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.070
- Sorry. So, I'll...
Nice talking to you.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.607
- Yeah. Okay. See you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.143
I got a ride in to work
with him this morning

04:05.212 --> 04:06.745
And he has not stopped talking.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.814
He's super sweet, but I'm pretty
sure he was working up the nerve

04:08.949 --> 04:10.949
To ask me out and
I was not looking forward

04:11.018 --> 04:12.617
To that super awkward rejection.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.353
Anyway, phew, dodged a bullet
with that one.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.121
Not that there's anything
wrong with watts.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.824
I just don't like mixing "bizz"
with "plesh",

04:18.959 --> 04:21.126
Except, of course, with
you guys. Oh, looking forward

04:21.261 --> 04:23.361
To that "partay" ton...
(groaning)

04:23.430 --> 04:24.562
Anyways, I'll see
you guys later.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.364
- Now, what was that?
What did you just say?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.233
- I don't know. Okay. Yeah.
- What'd you just say?

04:28.235 --> 04:29.234
What's she talking about?
- What?

04:29.369 --> 04:30.635
- What "partay"
is she talking about?

04:30.704 --> 04:32.837
- Let me think about it.
Oh, right, I have no clue.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.639
You know what? It's probably
just a figure of speech.

04:34.675 --> 04:35.841
You know, that's exactly
what it is.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.043
Ooh, got it, I know what it is.
It is a takedown party,

04:38.178 --> 04:40.178
That is what it is.
- Why do you sound like a robot?

04:40.314 --> 04:42.380
- Why are you talking like a--
- why was nathan acting weird?

04:42.449 --> 04:44.583
And why was adriana at my loft
this morning?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.652
- Who knows!
- Hold up, are y'all trying

04:46.787 --> 04:47.652
To throw me an engagement party?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.387
- I feel like
this is what's happening.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.189
If there's a secret, I know
nothing about it--

04:51.225 --> 04:53.391
- Emergency announcement meeting
in the boardroom. Now.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.094
(overlapping chatter)

04:57.264 --> 04:58.930
- Doesn't put me in
much of a mood for a party,

04:58.966 --> 04:59.931
I'll tell you that.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.600
- You told gloria about
the party?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.468
- What party?
I have no idea.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.712
(sighs)

05:14.748 --> 05:15.880
- Watts.
- Yeah?

05:15.916 --> 05:18.350
- Close the door.
- Yes, mom... Ma'am!

05:18.485 --> 05:20.418
- Oh, my...
(door closing)

05:22.156 --> 05:25.424
Okay, um... I just got off
the phone with the crown.

05:25.559 --> 05:29.361
Tuesday's defence team
has found out the identity

05:29.496 --> 05:32.764
Of our primary confidential
informant, jake mardy.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.600
And they have informed the crown
that they will be calling

05:35.636 --> 05:37.369
Jake to testify,
their position being

05:37.438 --> 05:39.071
He made have fed us
false information

05:39.206 --> 05:40.706
And may in fact be
the mastermind

05:40.841 --> 05:42.140
Behind this whole
purple rain business.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.375
(scoffs)

05:43.377 --> 05:45.143
- That's obviously not true.
- That's their position.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.979
- But if we expose
him as a police informant,

05:47.981 --> 05:49.781
He's gonna have a target
on his back.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.916
We don't know who
krish's connections are,
it could be anyone.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.352
- I am aware, which is why
we need to convince jake mardy

05:54.355 --> 05:55.920
To testify for the crown.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.989
- He won't come out publicly
as a snitch.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.725
- Then I won't be able
to go upstairs and convince
them to sign off

06:00.794 --> 06:03.261
On the costly expense of putting
him in witness protection.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.663
He'll be on his own.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.565
- How'd they find out
he's our ci?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.767
- I don't know,
but Tuesday's lawyer

06:08.769 --> 06:11.136
Is with goldstein, jacob,
field and wells.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.670
- That's steve's firm.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.539
Oh...

06:17.044 --> 06:19.611
- Nathan, naz,
I need you to find jake mardy.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.414
Convince him to testify.
And if he agrees,

06:22.416 --> 06:24.216
We'll get him into
a safe house right away.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.124
(sighs)

06:38.331 --> 06:40.832
- Come on, guys. You know better
than to show up here.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.434
- Things have taken a turn.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.102
- Oh, of course they have.
What's up?

06:44.104 --> 06:46.170
- Somehow, the defence has
found out you've been

06:46.206 --> 06:47.371
Informing for the police.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.773
They're planning on calling you
to the stand

06:48.776 --> 06:50.942
And making you testify.
- Okay, wait. What?

06:50.944 --> 06:52.778
Is this a joke? Is this
like some sort of sick prank

06:52.913 --> 06:54.712
To get me back for calling
you knee job?

06:54.748 --> 06:57.348
Because it isn't funny.
- I'm afraid it's not a joke.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.919
- Man, I knew this would happen!

07:01.955 --> 07:04.989
Oh my god, I am such
an idiot for trusting you!

07:05.058 --> 07:06.925
- Listen, jake, you can be mad
at me. That's fine.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.294
- I'll take that.
But this is serious, alright?

07:10.464 --> 07:12.931
We want you to testify
for our side instead.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.833
- I'm not testifying for anyone!

07:14.835 --> 07:17.202
If it comes out
that I'm a rat, I am dead.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.803
- I know this is not
what you want,

07:18.872 --> 07:21.439
But this is the reality
of the situation we're in now.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.509
The smartest thing to do is for
you to testify for the crown,

07:24.644 --> 07:26.978
That way we can protect you,
set you up somewhere safe.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.682
- You're talking about
witness protection, right?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.685
What kind of life is that, man?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.620
- What kind of a life is it
if you don't?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.489
I know krish is in prison
right now, but he's got money.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.225
And if he's really trying to be
a player out here,

07:40.227 --> 07:42.026
He's gonna make an example
out of you.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.228
- Yeah. Yeah. Obviously.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.431
And he's like, this angry,
spiteful bastard.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.900
And he's making even bigger
connections and...

07:50.170 --> 07:52.537
- With who?
- No. No. I'm done talking, man.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.907
- Listen, jake. Come on, man.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.243
You don't want this life
anymore anyway, right?

07:58.245 --> 08:01.446
Think of this as an opportunity.
A fresh start.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.783
- What about my girlfriend?
What about yolanda?

08:04.785 --> 08:07.118
- You're still talking to her?
Really?

08:07.120 --> 08:09.654
We can have her come with you.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.389
Look, we'll figure
that out later. Right now,

08:11.425 --> 08:12.657
We need to keep you safe.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.759
- Maybe I'll just, uh...

08:14.895 --> 08:16.461
I just need to think this
through, okay?

08:16.596 --> 08:18.863
So just give me like a couple
of hours and, um...

08:18.866 --> 08:20.999
Yeah. I'll get back to you,
okay? We'll figure it out.

08:21.935 --> 08:22.934
Yeah.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.135
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.470
- Jake--
- you gotta trust me, okay?

08:25.605 --> 08:26.871
I'll call you later.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.873
(door slamming)
- he's going to agree, right?

08:30.643 --> 08:31.943
- I don't think he has a choice.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.547
(phone ringing)

08:37.551 --> 08:38.950
- Hello. Oh, you wanted
to talk to me.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.618
I'm just gonna sit.
I was standing,

08:40.654 --> 08:42.420
But now I'm gonna sit.
Here I am, I just sat.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.488
(sighs)

08:51.298 --> 08:52.631
(gulps)

08:57.003 --> 08:59.437
- Do you like gossiping,
wazowski?

08:59.473 --> 09:01.639
- Uh... No.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.975
I mean, did you know that
gossiping serves

09:04.110 --> 09:06.044
As a really important
function in society?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.046
It's like, connect...
No, I don't. It's harmful.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.782
- So you don't like bringing
home juicy little tidbits

09:10.917 --> 09:12.850
To share with the hubby?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.853
You know, impress him with
your "badassery",

09:14.988 --> 09:16.721
Chatting about purple rain?

09:16.723 --> 09:19.991
- Uh, no, when I go home, I like
to play a game called wordle.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.760
And I don't really like to talk.
- So no speaking in code?

09:22.829 --> 09:25.262
No referring to<i> pluie mauve,</i>

09:25.299 --> 09:27.399
Anything like that?
No coy little messages

09:27.534 --> 09:29.334
That might make your husband
want to search

09:29.469 --> 09:30.468
Amongst your things.

09:30.537 --> 09:33.404
- No, I did not talk to steve
about this case.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.207
- Do you know
this jayna burden woman?

09:37.811 --> 09:39.443
- Is she the lawyer
on this case?

09:40.380 --> 09:42.347
- Yes, she is.
- Alright then.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.016
She's a junior lawyer. I heard
that she's kind of annoying--

09:45.151 --> 09:47.218
- Oh, that's interesting.
I thought you didn't talk
about work.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.621
- I don't talk about
my work to steve,

09:49.623 --> 09:51.389
He talks about his work
all the time.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.958
Listen, I understand that
this is very coincidental,

09:54.027 --> 09:56.227
But normally, when a ci's
identity is compromised,

09:56.363 --> 09:59.363
It comes back on the ci
themselves for acting strangely,

09:59.399 --> 10:00.598
Blabbing too much.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.835
- That's possible.
- If I find out anything

10:03.904 --> 10:05.836
About this case
I'm gonna come to you directly,

10:05.872 --> 10:08.606
Otherwise, I am going back
to my team, thank you very much.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.509
- I, uh, suppose I'll see you
tonight at this little um...

10:12.212 --> 10:13.244
Shindig?

10:14.381 --> 10:16.313
A lot of gossiping there,
I'm sure.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.717
- Not from me.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.454
- Good.

10:28.562 --> 10:30.095
- Steve, you better
pick up right now.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.330
I'm sorry to pull you away
from your precious jayna burden,

10:32.399 --> 10:34.199
Sorry to burden you
with all these phone calls,

10:34.334 --> 10:37.402
I am so mad at you right now.
I am so hurt by you right...

10:38.038 --> 10:39.370
- Hey.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.539
Did you tell steve about jake?
- No!

10:42.942 --> 10:45.043
Not intentionally,
but he knows all my passwords.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.978
And he's mister ambitious
and mister determined

10:46.980 --> 10:48.446
At work right now, so...

10:50.484 --> 10:51.849
The lawyer's name's
jayna burden.

10:54.388 --> 10:56.621
He told me this morning that
he's taken her under his wing.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.089
(sighs)

10:58.125 --> 11:00.357
- Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.760
Alright, you trust him?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.496
- I do.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.367
But I did before
and he cheated on me, so.

11:12.406 --> 11:13.671
Maybe I shouldn't.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.379
- Okay, so, you all need
to see this.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.781
- It just came in.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.984
<i> - So yeah, I lied about</i>
<i> everything.</i>

11:28.188 --> 11:29.854
<i>I thought it'd be funny screwing</i>
<i> with the cops.</i>

11:29.856 --> 11:31.789
(sighs)
<i> but it's not true</i>

11:31.825 --> 11:34.192
<i> Because I'm the one</i>
<i> who made the drugs.</i>

11:34.261 --> 11:36.928
<i> I'm the one who figured out</i>
<i> how to sell it online,</i>

11:36.997 --> 11:38.930
<i> In person, all of it.</i>

11:39.065 --> 11:42.233
<i> Krish, that Tuesday person.</i>

11:42.269 --> 11:43.735
<i>They had nothing to do with it.</i>

11:43.804 --> 11:47.405
<i>This was all me. It's all on me.</i>

11:47.474 --> 11:50.875
- He's lying. We have
full evidence against
krish and Tuesday.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.878
Everything he's saying is...
Is nonsense.

11:54.013 --> 11:56.080
- It doesn't matter.
He sent this video to everyone,

11:56.083 --> 11:57.882
To the crown, to the defence,
to the media.

11:58.017 --> 12:02.020
Now, nothing he has ever told us
is gonna be credible.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.155
- The crown's withdrawing
the charges.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.958
Krish and Tuesday are going
to be released later today.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.494
- What?!
- Are you kidding me?

12:09.496 --> 12:11.162
- We're letting guilty people
out onto the street?

12:11.231 --> 12:14.265
Dealers selling drugs
that are killing people.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.100
- We have the evidence.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.136
- We know that Tuesday's been
making the drugs.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.971
They admitted it.
- Well, they're singing

12:20.106 --> 12:21.372
A different story now.

12:21.408 --> 12:25.243
Their lawyer's pleading
coercion, intimidation, fear.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.945
- We found purple rain
in Tuesday's barn.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.915
- And the defence are gonna say
that the barn was abandoned,

12:31.050 --> 12:35.186
That jake is now claiming
that he is the ring leader

12:35.188 --> 12:37.255
And he was probably storing
his product there.

12:37.257 --> 12:41.058
- Oh, come on. Jake is not
running this operation.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.261
Somebody made him do this.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.196
Clearly somebody very dangerous.

12:45.331 --> 12:47.398
I mean, why would he suddenly
just change his mind like this?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.466
- I don't know.
But whatever the reason,

12:49.503 --> 12:52.003
Jake has just poked a million
holes in the crown's case.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.838
They know they can't win.
The case is dead.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.606
- Okay, well, we gotta find him.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.775
- You need to stay away
from him. Do you hear me?

12:57.811 --> 13:00.445
We have a bolo out on him,
we will bring him in,

13:00.580 --> 13:02.446
But listen to me, naz.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.982
You are not to go
anywhere near him.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.483
You are too personally involved
in this already.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.618
- Yeah.

13:07.654 --> 13:10.555
- Okay, let's just let this
rest for today,

13:10.557 --> 13:12.290
Come back fresh tomorrow

13:12.292 --> 13:14.291
And we'll figure out
our next moves then.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.493
Okay?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.161
- Except you, greene.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.763
You're the lead detective
on this,

13:18.765 --> 13:21.065
You need to go over your notes,
make sure they're in order.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.033
There's gonna be a lot
of eyeballs on this case

13:23.069 --> 13:25.135
Trying to figure out
where we screwed up.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.346
<i> - So yeah, I lied about</i>
<i> everything.</i>

13:36.516 --> 13:38.449
<i> I thought it'd be funny</i>
<i> screwing with the cops.</i>

13:38.585 --> 13:42.286
<i> But it's not true because</i>
<i>I'm the one who made the dru...</i>

13:43.256 --> 13:44.522
- Do you know
where he is right now?

13:44.591 --> 13:46.523
- Any ideas where he could be?

13:47.861 --> 13:50.195
- You know, I always knew
that steve was an asshole.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.864
Self-absorbed, entitled,

13:52.866 --> 13:54.899
Able to charm his way
out of anything.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.336
- We don't know that
it's steve.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.804
Okay?

13:59.806 --> 14:01.539
So let's find jake
and find out--

14:01.674 --> 14:03.107
- Hey.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.275
Don't go near him.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.278
Okay? Just stay away from him.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.149
- Come on, naz.
This isn't sam's fault.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.551
Naz! Okay, okay.
He didn't mean that.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.355
Alright, look. Let's just focus
on who might have intimidated

14:17.490 --> 14:19.990
Jake, okay?
- Yup. Okay.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.626
Um...

14:21.628 --> 14:23.227
It's not krish,
it's not Tuesday,

14:23.263 --> 14:24.828
Because they're still
in custody.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.297
- Yeah, they still are.
- Yeah.

14:28.435 --> 14:32.170
- And... It's gonna take a few
more hours for that paperwork

14:32.172 --> 14:33.737
To go through.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.377
(buzzing)

14:39.512 --> 14:41.646
Monday, Tuesday. Have a seat.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.316
(clears throat)

14:46.586 --> 14:48.652
- Thanks for coming down.
- It wasn't posed as a choice.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.621
- We just want to talk to you
before you get released.

14:50.624 --> 14:51.823
That alright?

14:51.825 --> 14:54.058
- Well, that's still a few
hours away, so until then,

14:54.094 --> 14:57.261
I don't have a say.
- Um... You must be feeling

14:57.264 --> 14:59.964
Pretty lucky, huh?
- No. Not really.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.132
I was kind of hoping to hide
away in prison, to be honest.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.669
- Uh, poor you, a drug dealer
who should be put away for years

15:04.738 --> 15:05.870
And their case gets
randomly tossed--

15:05.939 --> 15:08.472
- You know there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.208
So it's not free in here,
but it's not gonna be free
out there.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.411
- Alright, so talk to us then.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.046
Maybe we can help

15:15.048 --> 15:17.148
If you tell us
who you're working for.

15:17.283 --> 15:20.417
- No. Save your breath. I will
never co-operate with cops.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.621
Ever.
- Who are you afraid of, hm?

15:23.623 --> 15:25.556
Is it someone
in the replicants?

15:25.558 --> 15:28.159
- The replicants?
(laughing)

15:28.228 --> 15:29.627
I wish. Yeah.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.029
I liked the replicants.
They were my kind of people,

15:32.065 --> 15:33.698
They were like these wannabe
gangsters who liked

15:33.767 --> 15:35.033
Playing the tough guy.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.969
No, I never wanted to get in
with the real criminals,

15:37.971 --> 15:39.437
You know that.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.839
And yet, here I am, and I'm
about to get thrown out of jail

15:41.875 --> 15:43.307
Into a swamp full
of crocodiles.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.575
- Hey, if you don't want
your freedom,

15:44.611 --> 15:46.377
I'm sure we can arrange
something.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.645
- Okay.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.080
What do I do?

15:51.017 --> 15:52.717
I could throw
a violent outburst.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.786
I could punch a guard
or something.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.053
- You know what?

15:59.259 --> 16:00.758
- Did that do the trick?

16:03.196 --> 16:07.264
- Actually, no.
All it did was piss me off.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.265
(buzzing)

16:08.335 --> 16:10.267
- Well at least we know
there are bigger

16:10.303 --> 16:12.070
And scarier people in the mix

16:12.072 --> 16:14.738
Which lines up
with naz's theory

16:14.774 --> 16:16.573
That jake was put up to this.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.276
- Hey...

16:19.312 --> 16:21.746
Maybe they could help us
connect the dots.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.815
- I'll try anything
at this point.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.417
- ...Vacation saved, I could
take a trip to the bahamas,

16:26.486 --> 16:28.619
Maybe run into adeline french.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.688
Or clover english,
as she's going by these days.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.825
Can I help you?
- Adeline french? You found her?

16:36.095 --> 16:37.295
- Jaw-dropped, are we?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.997
Gobsmacked, perhaps?
Flabbergasted.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.498
Dumbfounded.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.434
Let us walk you through it.
Susan.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.370
- We started from the beginning.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.038
Followed a thread.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.773
- We looked into her mother.
We wanted to know

16:48.908 --> 16:51.975
If she got any calls or visitors
while in prison. Nada.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.778
Then we chased the threads
connected to everything

16:54.814 --> 16:57.948
I knew about her. Her love
of clothes. Her love of wigs.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.717
Her fear of eggs.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.119
I knew that she loved
the caribbean islands

17:02.155 --> 17:04.889
And liked top-shelf bordeaux.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.658
So I looked into
all of the fancy hotel bars

17:07.660 --> 17:09.126
In the virgin islands,

17:09.195 --> 17:11.329
Got a hold of their security
coverage...

17:11.331 --> 17:14.665
Until eventually,
we found this

17:14.734 --> 17:16.467
On security footage
at an outdoor patio

17:16.602 --> 17:18.669
At gemini beach club in
the virgin islands.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.005
(clapping)
thank you, susan.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.673
- I've gotta say,
I am impressed.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.775
- Well, it was a collective
effort from everyone involved

17:24.778 --> 17:26.711
In badge bitches.
- So just you and susan here.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.745
- Oh, there are other members.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.713
- Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?

17:31.751 --> 17:32.816
- Right.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.752
Okay, we gotta show this
to fugitive squad.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.820
I mean, they've been trying to
track adeline down for months.

17:37.624 --> 17:38.956
- You know what?

17:38.992 --> 17:41.092
This is exactly what we need
to do with purple rain.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.559
We need to go back
to the beginning

17:42.595 --> 17:44.228
And follow all the threads.
- Mm.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.863
- Oh, so you're saying
you just have copious amounts

17:45.899 --> 17:47.831
Of hours to do this on your own?
- It's tedious work.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.634
- Uh, well, you know what?
Do you wanna sign up?

17:49.769 --> 17:50.901
Do you wanna help?
You wanna help?

17:50.970 --> 17:52.169
- Well, that depends.
- Okay.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.905
- Would you like to be a part
of badge bitches?

17:53.907 --> 17:55.906
- Uh...
- Mm-hmm.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.309
- What are the requirements?
- Bi-weekly meetings.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.045
- A very active and ongoing
demanding whatsapp group chat.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.679
- Whatever, just sign us up,
sign me up.

18:02.715 --> 18:03.981
- Okay. I'll get
the paperwork going

18:04.050 --> 18:08.051
And until then,
badge bitches, activate!

18:08.088 --> 18:10.454
(imitating explosions)
- watch this!

18:10.457 --> 18:11.855
(indistinct chatter)

18:11.891 --> 18:13.524
- Pretty fun. We're getting
better at it. It's great.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.560
(brakes squeaking)

18:29.275 --> 18:30.674
(sighs)

18:54.467 --> 18:57.168
- Jake, it's me.
I'm off work here.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.708
Jake, I recognized
the wallpaper from your video.

19:04.977 --> 19:05.643
If your grandma still
lived here, she'd tell you

19:05.778 --> 19:07.578
That you're being very rude.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.587
Come on, man, I got pizza
and beer out here.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.125
- You here to work
or you here to party?

19:22.728 --> 19:23.860
(sighs)

19:24.864 --> 19:27.097
- Fine. I'm here to party.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.608
<i> - What have you got?</i>
<i> - Okay, so,</i>

19:37.644 --> 19:39.143
<i> We have this drug,</i>
<i> it's called purple rain.</i>

19:39.145 --> 19:40.811
- It's a cathinone,
sort of like bath salts.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.547
(both): But everything in it
is totally illegal.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.748
(laughing)

19:43.883 --> 19:45.283
- You can't get anything
past you.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.550
- I know.
- Swallows.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.851
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.153
- We're gonna have to get a list
together of all the ingredients

19:50.190 --> 19:52.155
And then we're gonna have to
track down all of the suppliers

19:52.192 --> 19:53.891
In the city and the province.
- In the country, really,

19:53.960 --> 19:55.559
If we want to be thorough.
- Oh my god,

19:55.628 --> 19:56.894
This is gonna take months.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.762
There's not enough badge
bitches. We need a shortcut.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.764
(sighs)
- yeah, you're right.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.434
We need someone
who understands the science.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.170
- Like a scientist?

20:07.807 --> 20:11.976
- A normal cathinone
is made by adding ethyl
magnesium bromide

20:12.111 --> 20:15.012
To 3-methylbenzaldehyde.
Then oxidizing that

20:15.081 --> 20:17.648
With pyridinium chlorochromate
on silica gel

20:17.717 --> 20:20.918
And brominated with hydrobromic
acid to yield the bromo ketone.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.421
But something's different
with purple rain.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.389
- It's very different.
- Of course.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.491
- Its creator swapped
the standard pyridinium

20:27.560 --> 20:30.261
Chlorochromate
with potassium permanganate.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.928
- Yay.
- I don't get

20:31.965 --> 20:33.197
What you're saying.
- It's commonly used

20:33.266 --> 20:35.399
In dermatitis, wound cleaning,

20:35.468 --> 20:36.867
Water filtration systems.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.735
- We looked through that file.
We didn't see anything.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.871
- Because maybe
your chemist wouldn't buy

20:40.873 --> 20:43.007
Potassium permanganate,
they would make it.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.476
It's equivalent to making
pancakes from scratch

20:45.545 --> 20:46.944
Instead of from the box.
- Oh.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.313
- My guess is your chemist
bought both potassium

20:49.315 --> 20:51.081
And permanganic acid.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.150
That might narrow it down.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.485
- It does.

20:54.620 --> 20:58.021
There's only three importers
who sell both chemicals.

20:58.057 --> 21:01.025
- Just one guy imported a ton
of both to two aquarium shops.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.893
- Aquarium shops? Let me see.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.366
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.634
It's fin city.
This is jenn's shop.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.471
Remember ro's friend, jenn?
She owns fin city.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.707
- Look. There's one in toronto.
And one in guelph.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.743
- Oh my god.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.777
- Tuesday's working with jenn.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.648
- What about ro?

21:31.157 --> 21:32.189
- Steve, hey!

21:32.258 --> 21:34.124
You didn't have to come
all the way down here,

21:34.160 --> 21:35.993
You could have just called.
- You sounded angry enough.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.461
It felt more urgent
than a phone call.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.496
- Sorry, I just thought
that you went through my stuff

21:39.532 --> 21:42.099
To find the name of
our confidential informant.

21:43.036 --> 21:44.201
- Why was that
your first thought?

21:44.203 --> 21:46.136
- I don't know, steve.
I mean, come on, you're like

21:46.172 --> 21:48.005
Desperate to prove
yourself at work

21:48.007 --> 21:49.873
And now you're working
with this jayna person.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.776
I don't know, I don't know why.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.276
- You don't trust me?

21:53.846 --> 21:55.212
(distant siren)

21:57.350 --> 21:58.883
You don't trust me.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.820
Ever think
it might have been ro?

22:04.223 --> 22:06.557
She was on your computer the
other day looking up recipes.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.360
- Ro was on my computer?

22:09.495 --> 22:11.294
- To be fair, she was actually
looking up a recipe

22:11.331 --> 22:13.164
For egyptian foole.
But she was alone at the house

22:13.299 --> 22:15.900
When I got there,
so who knows how long
she was on your computer.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.901
- Oh, wow. Okay.
Uh, I have to go--

22:17.970 --> 22:20.037
- But I want to know why
you're so quick to blame me.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.605
- You know what? Hey.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.508
We're gonna talk about
this at home, you look--

22:24.643 --> 22:26.711
You're... Um, I gotta go
back to work. I gotta go.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.515
Kell? Kell.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.117
- What's up?
- Hey...

22:33.252 --> 22:34.785
Steve caught ro on my computer.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.654
She said she was looking
at a recipe.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.190
- Ooh, does she know
your password?

22:39.192 --> 22:41.525
- Well, maybe she figured it
out, because, you know,

22:41.594 --> 22:43.627
She saw me punch it in
a few times and I just,

22:43.629 --> 22:45.329
I wasn't that careful
around her.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.031
- Maybe you should keep
not being careful.

22:49.102 --> 22:50.300
You let her find out
a few things that can

22:50.370 --> 22:52.803
Lead her down a path.
- What? Really? Set up a trap?

22:53.806 --> 22:56.207
- Why not?
- Well, because, I just...

22:56.342 --> 22:59.477
Yeah. Why not.
Okay, how about this?

22:59.612 --> 23:04.148
Um... I will invite her and jenn
over to dinner at mine

23:04.150 --> 23:05.816
Tomorrow night with you and me.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.018
It would be a best friend
double date, nail her!

23:08.020 --> 23:11.021
- Why put off tomorrow
what can be done today?

23:11.090 --> 23:13.224
I happen to know a few friends
coming together tonight

23:13.359 --> 23:15.559
For a certain surprise party.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.829
- You figured it out?
- Mm-hmm.

23:18.898 --> 23:19.996
- It's a secret.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.836
(muffled music)

23:25.872 --> 23:27.738
(chuckling)

23:27.740 --> 23:29.139
- Drink.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.108
- Wow, jake.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.777
You got olympic skill level
over here.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.247
- Yeah, it's too bad
I couldn't go pro.

23:36.249 --> 23:39.116
Remember how drunk you got
at craig's birthday party?

23:39.185 --> 23:41.452
You passed out before dark.
- Yeah.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.920
You drew a dick on my face.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.355
- So good. With a sharpie.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.992
School on Monday, dick outline
still on your cheek.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.562
- Why don't you let me help you
out of this, jake?

23:52.731 --> 23:54.097
I can tell you're scared.

23:55.268 --> 23:57.401
And you always are desperate
to have a good time

23:57.470 --> 23:59.003
Any time you're freaked out.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.605
Like that time, remember
we went to that school trip

24:01.607 --> 24:04.074
To rouge park,
got lost in the forest.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.143
I was trying to find our way
out of the woods and you,

24:06.212 --> 24:07.611
You were looking
for a lighter that worked

24:07.746 --> 24:10.214
So you could smoke that weed
that you found in your pocket.

24:10.283 --> 24:12.883
What about the time
when your mom got sick, huh?

24:13.886 --> 24:16.387
I get it, you can't stand
being scared.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.425
- Truth is, I miss you, man.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.963
- Yeah, well, I'm here now.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.731
- No, this isn't you.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.766
You used to not be such a dork.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.434
You knew how to have fun.

24:32.371 --> 24:34.538
But that guy's not here.
Where is he?

24:35.574 --> 24:37.775
- He became an adult.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.711
Wanted to be a contributing
member of society.

24:41.347 --> 24:42.479
- Right.

24:50.055 --> 24:52.589
Oh. Wow. It's about time.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.294
- Why don't you tell me who
made you take this fall?

24:59.665 --> 25:01.231
- Okay. So...

25:02.468 --> 25:05.068
The people I used to work with
wanted to expand, right?

25:06.205 --> 25:08.338
So they made a big promise
to some bad people,

25:08.374 --> 25:12.542
But then you guys
confiscated that promise

25:12.578 --> 25:14.344
And now everybody's scrambling.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.680
- Just tell me who they are.

25:16.815 --> 25:17.614
I can help you.

25:20.786 --> 25:21.952
- Tell you what.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.620
If you want me to talk...

25:24.757 --> 25:26.090
Beat me at this game.

25:27.727 --> 25:28.725
Drink.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.796
(humming)

25:37.136 --> 25:38.501
- Tueli!

25:38.538 --> 25:40.371
- Oh, kelly. Hey.
- Sup.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.572
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.707
- Hi, there you are. Hi.

25:43.842 --> 25:47.177
Hi. Ugh, you know,
I've been buzzing,

25:47.246 --> 25:49.012
Buzzing,
thinking you were home.

25:49.081 --> 25:52.849
Uh, normally somebody passes
and let's me in but not today.

25:53.553 --> 25:54.651
Pointless, right? Yeah.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.121
Um, I lost my keycard
so I was just kind of hoping

25:57.123 --> 25:58.589
Someone would show up.

25:58.591 --> 26:01.091
- Right. Right.

26:01.127 --> 26:04.461
Well, here I am.
- Thank you.

26:04.497 --> 26:05.829
- Mm-hmm.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.674
- Open...
- Ugh, I'm opening it.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.678
(all): Surprise!

26:21.914 --> 26:25.616
- Oh, wow, I am so blown away.

26:25.751 --> 26:29.486
What a surprise!
- You had no idea, right?

26:29.488 --> 26:33.089
Fooled you.
- Yeah... You sure did.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.825
- You need a ladies' night
to celebrate.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.760
Oh, karina couldn't be here,
she's at home with brixy,

26:36.796 --> 26:38.162
He's got a cold.
- Okay.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.896
- But, I have another surprise
for you.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.499
- What? Let me guess,
a stripper?

26:42.535 --> 26:44.568
- She was really glad
we invited her.

26:44.703 --> 26:48.572
- You got me a girl? Ooh--
- congratulations, honey!

26:48.574 --> 26:52.976
Oh, I haven't seen you
in such a long time.

26:52.979 --> 26:56.446
Come on, you don't have a hug
for your old mama?

26:58.684 --> 27:00.050
- Wow...

27:00.052 --> 27:03.019
You guys know how to knock me
on my ass, don't you?

27:03.055 --> 27:04.521
- You know I don't do parties,
right?

27:04.590 --> 27:06.857
But I just had to come and
celebrate the fact

27:06.859 --> 27:08.726
That you finally found yourself
a good man.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.395
And he found himself
a great woman, come on!

27:11.464 --> 27:13.831
- I really appreciate it,
I really do.

27:13.833 --> 27:17.467
I see you all have met my mom,
donna, I guess.

27:17.503 --> 27:21.038
- She has kept us in stitches
for the last half-hour.

27:21.107 --> 27:24.007
She was telling us stories
about you and your sisters.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.143
(laughing)

27:26.145 --> 27:27.944
- I bet. Sorry I missed it.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.215
Um, I need a drink,

27:31.350 --> 27:32.649
So, I'll be right back.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.284
Continue the party.

27:34.286 --> 27:37.287
(laughing)
- well, back to me.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.089
(laughing)

27:39.091 --> 27:40.791
Now, you think I've been
sharing stories?

27:40.926 --> 27:43.626
Girl, I have not told you
anything yet.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.295
You gotta get comfortable.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.297
Awhere did I put my drink?
Where's my drink?

27:47.299 --> 27:49.833
- Here, it's over here.
- There you go. Okay.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.269
(overlapping chatter)

27:56.108 --> 27:56.973
- Yeah...

27:59.945 --> 28:01.678
Alright. I win.

28:02.748 --> 28:04.081
Now talk.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.249
Hurry up.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.417
I'm not feeling so good.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.521
- Oh my god, I love this song!

28:10.656 --> 28:12.789
(muffled music)

28:13.959 --> 28:16.193
- Man, I can't handle
drinking like I used to.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.261
(sighs)

28:17.396 --> 28:19.329
- Yeah, man.
That's not the booze.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.531
It's probably the purple rain
I slipped into your drink

28:21.600 --> 28:23.333
A while ago.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.334
- What?!

28:24.870 --> 28:25.669
Are you...

28:26.272 --> 28:27.671
Are you serious?

28:27.673 --> 28:30.140
- Yeah, man. I'm dead serious.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.209
It's gonna be a trip.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.212
Whew!

28:35.281 --> 28:36.746
Ha, ha, ha!

28:38.718 --> 28:40.217
(rhythmic music)

28:41.754 --> 28:43.487
(breathing deeply)

28:47.093 --> 28:48.892
(laughing)
- I never thought I'd

28:48.928 --> 28:52.428
See the day when
this one got married.

28:53.699 --> 28:56.567
I remember kelly heading off
to school some Halloween,

28:56.702 --> 28:59.102
Must have been about
second grade.

28:59.105 --> 29:02.372
She was dressed as wonder woman.
(all): Aw.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.907
- She was wearing one
of my wigs,

29:04.042 --> 29:06.310
Big cape made out of
a garbage bag,

29:06.312 --> 29:08.178
And I said to her, I said,

29:08.214 --> 29:11.381
"why did you pick wonder woman?"

29:11.383 --> 29:12.682
You know what she said?

29:14.453 --> 29:18.655
Cool bracelet, fights bad guys,

29:18.691 --> 29:21.191
Never has to get married.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.826
(cheering)

29:25.063 --> 29:27.864
- Right. Is that before you went
on that trip to cancun

29:27.933 --> 29:31.201
For a week then didn't come back
for two months?

29:32.104 --> 29:34.938
- You are right. You are right.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.208
I started interning at a little
pottery shop

29:38.244 --> 29:40.143
I stumbled onto.

29:40.146 --> 29:43.913
I was very caught up in finding
myself back then.

29:45.151 --> 29:49.052
But here I was, all along.

29:52.224 --> 29:52.956
(clears throat)

29:54.260 --> 29:57.460
- So, um, speaking of
wonder woman,

29:57.530 --> 30:02.365
Uh, did you know that
the creator also invented
the polygraph?

30:02.401 --> 30:03.700
(gasping)
- no!

30:03.836 --> 30:04.968
- Yeah, yeah.

30:05.103 --> 30:06.904
And a bit of a non sequitur,

30:06.906 --> 30:09.239
He was also into bondage
and submission.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.575
(laughing)
- fascinating.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.578
Gloria, are you married?
- Me?

30:14.647 --> 30:17.514
Oh. No. I've never really
seen the point.

30:17.649 --> 30:22.385
For me, it only became, um,
legal in 2005.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.054
- Respect. I am with you.

30:25.691 --> 30:27.357
I mean, I love men.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.459
And women.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.730
But I wouldn't want
to be married to any of 'em.

30:33.766 --> 30:36.066
(laughing)
am I right?

30:36.201 --> 30:37.568
- You are right!

30:37.703 --> 30:39.670
- This was a really,
really bad idea.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.137
- Kelly, relax.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.073
Live a little, forgive a little.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.141
She's not the same person
she was when we were kids.

30:45.211 --> 30:48.211
Why don't you take five minutes
to find that out for yourself.

30:50.148 --> 30:51.548
(sighs)

31:01.560 --> 31:03.426
- Are you sure she's not
going to mind?

31:03.495 --> 31:05.562
- Yeah, kelly said, "bring ro".

31:05.697 --> 31:07.631
And then she said my friends
are her friends.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.632
You know, ro,
and your friends are my friends,

31:09.668 --> 31:12.903
So guess what?
That makes all of us friends.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.905
- Ro thinks I spend too much
time talking to fish

31:14.974 --> 31:16.907
And not enough time talking
to humans, so.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.241
- I do think that.

31:19.444 --> 31:20.710
- Your friends like tequila?

31:20.746 --> 31:22.012
- Who doesn't?

31:25.751 --> 31:27.116
(buzzing)

31:30.556 --> 31:32.188
- I appreciate you inviting her.

31:32.224 --> 31:35.191
I'm the only person she has
in the world and it's just...

31:35.227 --> 31:37.760
It's a lot sometimes.
- Oh my gosh, no problem.

31:38.731 --> 31:39.863
Let's get in there
and have some fun.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.064
- Alright.
- Yeah.

31:41.199 --> 31:42.132
- Yeah.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.136
(overlapping chatter)

31:46.138 --> 31:48.438
- Hi.
- Hello!

31:48.507 --> 31:49.606
- Ah! Welcome!

31:49.675 --> 31:51.275
Come in! Come in.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.412
- Jenn, don't be shy.
Come on.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.482
Kelly, oh my god.
Congratulations.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.683
It's so great,
I'm so happy for you.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.819
- Oh, thank you so much, ro.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.355
Bit last minute, but so glad
you could make it.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.791
I'm sorry, you are?
- Jenn.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.026
Diamante. We were having
a taco night

32:10.095 --> 32:11.828
And then the next thing I know,
here we are.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.530
- Is that prometida tequila?

32:13.599 --> 32:16.700
- Yes, ma'am, my favourite.
You wanna do shots with me?

32:16.702 --> 32:18.635
- Please, yes.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.570
(laughing)
- oh my gosh,

32:20.639 --> 32:22.672
I feel that headache
coming on.

32:23.909 --> 32:27.077
- Uh, these are my bosses.
This is ro wells.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.246
Uh, she works with steve
at the firm.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.716
- Wow, a defence lawyer.
- Usually, but not tonight.

32:32.718 --> 32:33.750
- Good.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.385
- Tonight, I'm here celebrating
friendship.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.654
- Oh, isn't that nice?
- Okay, let me get you a drink.

32:38.691 --> 32:41.258
- Yes, friend. Please.

32:41.393 --> 32:44.194
- So you're the friend
that works in the aquarium
store, right?

32:44.196 --> 32:46.196
- That's me.
- Is there a lot of money

32:46.265 --> 32:47.797
In that line of business, or...

32:47.833 --> 32:49.266
(chuckling)
- why?

32:49.401 --> 32:50.734
You looking to switch careers?

32:50.736 --> 32:53.036
- Hey, it's always
a possibility, right?

32:53.605 --> 32:54.971
- What?

32:54.974 --> 32:57.407
Your job's way more exciting
than mine,

32:57.476 --> 32:59.810
Busting big, bad, drug dealers.

32:59.945 --> 33:02.079
- Sounds more fun than it is.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.214
You know, most drug dealers
are just people

33:04.283 --> 33:05.816
Who ended up on the wrong path.

33:05.951 --> 33:08.017
- That's very compassionate
of you.

33:08.053 --> 33:10.087
Not a typical cop,
I take it.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.288
- No.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.157
I try not to be.
- Stop! No! Wait!

33:14.193 --> 33:15.993
Halt for me, me... I join.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.727
Okay, here we go.

33:18.397 --> 33:19.429
Thank you.
(sighs)

33:19.564 --> 33:22.099
Alright!
- Ladies.

33:22.101 --> 33:25.034
- Uh-uh-uh.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.236
- Uh.

33:27.039 --> 33:28.238
- Mm.

33:28.907 --> 33:31.041
- Mm.
- Uh--

33:31.176 --> 33:32.776
- Mm...

33:32.845 --> 33:35.111
- That'll get
the party started. Mm.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.014
- I'll go share them around.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.516
- My eyes are watering.

33:39.651 --> 33:40.850
Ugh.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.788
Did you get anything out of her?

33:44.857 --> 33:46.456
- No. I'm still feeling her out.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.592
Plus, I am grateful
for anything to distract me

33:48.594 --> 33:50.993
From the guest
I was surprised with.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.362
- What happened?
Did tueli invite her mother?

33:52.364 --> 33:53.797
- No, adriana brought mine.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.732
- That's your mother?
- Yes, that's mine.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.468
(soft music)

33:59.471 --> 34:01.071
(soft groaning)

34:05.343 --> 34:06.876
- Whoa.

34:07.746 --> 34:08.878
(sighs)

34:13.152 --> 34:15.852
- Oh gosh. Oh gosh.

34:17.623 --> 34:18.821
Oh no.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.224
Oh no, buddy.

34:22.661 --> 34:23.960
Buddy.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.096
I gave you too much.

34:26.765 --> 34:27.830
Yeah.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.833
You're doing the zombie thing.

34:31.403 --> 34:32.836
Relax. Relax...

34:34.540 --> 34:35.438
It'll pass.

34:38.010 --> 34:39.308
Guess what?

34:40.045 --> 34:41.511
I'm leaving town.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.648
Costa rica is awesome, hm?

34:46.685 --> 34:48.118
Maybe a little obvious.

34:48.987 --> 34:52.121
Yeah, maybe ecuador?

34:52.691 --> 34:54.324
Panama?

34:54.459 --> 34:58.929
Tree house in the forest,
hunker down and just...

35:01.233 --> 35:02.866
Makes you sharp--
- I see you.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.367
- You can see things.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.170
I... See you.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.139
- I see you.

35:09.141 --> 35:10.740
- Hey naz.

35:11.977 --> 35:15.879
Easy, naz. Watch out, naz.
Check it out.

35:16.014 --> 35:17.948
I got a vision, naz.
- Don't.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.016
(chuckles)
- trust me.

35:20.152 --> 35:21.451
- Don't!

35:24.222 --> 35:25.622
(chuckling)

35:26.992 --> 35:28.291
- See?

35:29.961 --> 35:31.994
It's making
the real you come out.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.097
You're strong.

35:34.232 --> 35:35.899
You're tough.

35:35.968 --> 35:37.234
- I don't like this, jake.

35:39.104 --> 35:40.770
I don't like this at all.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.440
- It's okay, man. It's okay.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.911
Now listen. I gotta get this
for posterity.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.779
(chuckling)

35:49.781 --> 35:51.982
Hi, nazeer,

35:51.984 --> 35:55.118
Off his head
on purple rain.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.586
- Stop! Stop!

35:56.721 --> 35:58.588
- Your cop pals
are gonna love it.

35:58.723 --> 36:01.191
(laughing)
- biggest cocaine arrest

36:01.326 --> 36:05.361
In canadian history,
the mastermind right here,

36:05.363 --> 36:07.197
This woman right here.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.465
- Oh, come on now,
it was nothing.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.935
Look, it was just five guys
sitting around

36:12.004 --> 36:13.136
Picking their asses.

36:13.138 --> 36:16.673
All it took is one woman
with an opinion.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.141
- A big opinion.
- Well--

36:18.276 --> 36:19.342
- Yeah.

36:19.477 --> 36:22.279
- How much product?
- Ooh. How much product.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.547
- I've seen the wire,
I know the lingo.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.149
- Oh, come on, ro,
you must have defended

36:26.284 --> 36:27.617
Big drug dealers before.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.051
- You know I don't
kiss and tell.

36:29.087 --> 36:32.289
But if you women had
a hand in bringing them down,

36:32.291 --> 36:33.957
There's no way I would have
stood a chance

36:34.092 --> 36:35.758
At getting them off.
- Well, that's funny,

36:35.794 --> 36:37.594
Because you got a crackerjack
lawyer at your firm

36:37.729 --> 36:40.496
Who found a way to get
our whole case thrown out.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.831
- Oh, that case was yours?

36:42.801 --> 36:44.701
We've had these geniuses
coming to us

36:44.703 --> 36:46.169
Right out of law school
these days.

36:46.238 --> 36:48.238
- Oh, what law school? I'm
thinking of going to law school.

36:48.307 --> 36:49.706
- Oh, what about policing?

36:49.775 --> 36:51.041
- You know, I thought
about policing,

36:51.176 --> 36:53.576
But not now that I have a baby.
- Why not?

36:53.579 --> 36:55.312
(overlapping chatter)
- she's a mother--

36:55.447 --> 36:58.381
- Okay, you know what?
Let's not forget why we're here,

36:58.417 --> 37:00.082
To cheers, kelly.

37:01.386 --> 37:04.120
Congratulations on your
not so very secret engagement.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.055
(cheering)

37:10.162 --> 37:14.264
- Okay, okay. I would like to--

37:14.266 --> 37:18.001
- Oh, I love this song! Ugh!

37:18.070 --> 37:20.136
(laughing)

37:20.205 --> 37:23.807
I cannot hear this song
and not move!

37:23.942 --> 37:26.243
- Mom, we can't talk
when the music is so loud.

37:26.378 --> 37:30.413
- Then don't talk, dance.
Come on!

37:30.482 --> 37:32.948
(cheering)

37:32.985 --> 37:35.351
(overlapping chatter)

37:41.192 --> 37:43.760
(hip-hop music)

38:00.445 --> 38:02.512
(grunting)

38:02.514 --> 38:04.014
(screaming)

38:06.952 --> 38:09.018
(panting)

38:10.122 --> 38:12.255
- Whoa, so cute.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.723
- It's a goby fish.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.825
I got it with jenn.
We were what, 16?

38:16.995 --> 38:18.728
- Mm-hmm.
- She's the goby, not me.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.030
- Show me yours.
- Ugh, no. That's okay.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.366
- She's the pistol shrimp.
They're best buddies.

38:23.368 --> 38:25.134
- Like, symbiotic?

38:26.571 --> 38:28.070
(both): Mutualistic.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.605
- Jinx, buy me a coke.

38:29.607 --> 38:31.341
Show your tattoo. Do it.
- Ugh.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.480
Yeah, mutualism is the highest
form of symbiosis

38:37.615 --> 38:39.014
Because, um, well, it's...

38:39.051 --> 38:40.617
- Both parties' benefit.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.920
- Goby and the shrimp,
they bond as juveniles

38:44.055 --> 38:45.822
And then they stay together
their entire lives.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.623
Just like me and jenn.

38:48.293 --> 38:49.359
(knocking)

38:49.361 --> 38:50.426
- I'll get it.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.594
- Yeah, thank you.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.199
- I'm here.
- Yes, please.

39:02.907 --> 39:04.174
- I have new--
- no, I know...

39:04.176 --> 39:05.641
- Purple rain--
- no, shh, stop,

39:05.643 --> 39:07.844
'cause we have to do it
in there. Okay? Oh, god.

39:09.181 --> 39:12.047
- I'm here with new information
on the purple rain case.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.684
- What are you doing?
- It's about the informant.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.788
- I don't care, not at my
engagement party, give me this!

39:18.790 --> 39:21.791
Put it on my desk upstairs
and deal with it later, come on.

39:22.594 --> 39:25.294
(indistinct chatter)

39:38.209 --> 39:42.145
- I gotta get her home,
she's had way too much tequila.

39:42.214 --> 39:43.913
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Wow.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.681
Okay. Uh, where's your bathroom?

39:45.751 --> 39:48.151
- There's one that way
or upstairs, please.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.485
- I'm just gonna take
her upstairs

39:49.554 --> 39:51.020
Because this is already
embarrassing enough,

39:51.156 --> 39:53.356
You don't need to see her
hurl her guts.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.224
Come on. There you go,
there you go.

39:56.361 --> 39:58.294
- What are you two guys up to?

39:58.330 --> 40:00.697
(both): What are you
talking about?

40:00.699 --> 40:03.166
- I am not ready
to shut this night down,

40:03.168 --> 40:05.168
Let's open another bottle.
- No--

40:05.237 --> 40:06.903
- I gotta go to bed,
I'm so sleepy.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.105
- Okay, maybe we can go
find a drink somewhere else.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.273
- Yeah!
- Come on.

40:10.342 --> 40:13.309
- That's a good idea!
- Tomorrow is another day.

40:13.445 --> 40:15.912
Excelsior!

40:16.047 --> 40:17.313
Come on!

40:17.916 --> 40:19.449
- My baby...

40:19.584 --> 40:22.084
Mm, my baby.
- Yeah.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.255
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:28.226 --> 40:31.094
- That woman was out of my life.

40:31.229 --> 40:34.363
- She's your mother, she's
always gonna be in your life.

40:37.235 --> 40:39.402
- Thank you. I love you.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.138
Say hi to my baby.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.608
- Okay. That... That was a lot.

40:45.677 --> 40:48.211
Uh, kelly, bravo.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.812
Sam, I love you.

40:49.881 --> 40:53.349
And tequila sheila, the uber's
on the way, we're gonna go.

40:53.418 --> 40:57.019
- Good luck with your drug busts
and your gang detangling.

40:57.055 --> 41:00.690
- Good luck dismantling
the coral reefs of the world.

41:00.825 --> 41:03.359
- Brush your teeth.
- Shall we?

41:04.729 --> 41:06.729
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.035
Wow.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.371
I guess jenn sobered up
pretty quickly

41:15.373 --> 41:17.072
When we weren't
watching her, huh?

41:19.778 --> 41:21.110
You okay?

41:22.180 --> 41:23.913
- I just feel really stupid.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.682
I really liked ro.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.987
She kind of made me feel like
less of a weirdo.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.990
- Mm.
- Kell, what's wrong with me?

41:35.126 --> 41:36.225
- What?

41:37.729 --> 41:39.529
- Like, when will I ever learn?

41:39.531 --> 41:41.864
- What are you supposed
to learn? Hmm?

41:41.933 --> 41:45.601
To never let anyone in?
To always have your walls up?

41:46.571 --> 41:49.539
No, honey, that's no good.
Come here.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.812
- You should take
your own advice.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.079
Your mom...

41:58.416 --> 41:59.749
She's not so bad.

42:03.555 --> 42:04.754
- Yeah.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.056
Maybe.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.359
(soft music)

42:43.461 --> 42:45.661
(grunting)

42:45.697 --> 42:48.197
(panting)

43:15.026 --> 43:16.558
Subtitling: Difuze
