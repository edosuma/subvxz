WEBVTT

00:03.044 --> 00:06.131
LI'L SISTER DON'T CHA

00:08.258 --> 00:11.595
Oh, no. Here comes another order.

00:14.514 --> 00:19.853
I need two martinis.
One straight up, one over.

00:20.895 --> 00:24.273
Gin or... vodka?

00:25.983 --> 00:29.028
Gin. Beefeaters.

00:33.449 --> 00:35.409
Anything else?

00:37.119 --> 00:39.914
Yes. There's something else.

00:41.624 --> 00:45.211
Something I need... desperately.

00:49.173 --> 00:51.217
A Molson Golden ale.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.638
Sam, you're out of this room.

00:58.432 --> 01:01.559
Coach, we were gonna kiss.

01:01.726 --> 01:03.770
We were?

01:05.438 --> 01:08.191
Do you mind if I do these first, Sam?

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.935 --> 02:30.312
It won't budge.

02:31.397 --> 02:34.483
I think I'll be pregnant
for the rest of my life.

02:34.650 --> 02:36.902
Just like it said in the yearbook.

02:39.697 --> 02:44.160
- Stubborn little bugger, isn't he?
- He learnt about brothers and sisters.

02:44.326 --> 02:47.747
He decided to stay inside
where it's safe.

02:48.831 --> 02:54.003
There's a theory that late-born babies
are more intelligent. I was born late.

02:54.170 --> 02:57.590
- Hey, so was I.
- It was just a theory.

02:59.633 --> 03:02.511
- How did it happen the last time?
- Benny Hill did it.

03:02.678 --> 03:07.766
- Benny Hill?
- I laughed so hard I went into labour.

03:07.932 --> 03:10.101
I heard that could happen.

03:10.268 --> 03:14.272
If laughter's what you need, I have
a face that makes people laugh.

03:14.439 --> 03:17.192
But you got a nice personality, Diane.

03:20.862 --> 03:24.324
No, I'm going to make a funny face.

03:29.746 --> 03:33.958
I don't think it's gonna help,
but go ahead.

03:34.125 --> 03:36.169
Very funny.

03:36.336 --> 03:40.465
Let me have two Gansetts
for the lovely couple at the back.

03:40.632 --> 03:44.092
- Have you got yourself covered yet?
- Yeah, it's all set.

03:44.259 --> 03:47.387
- My sister's gonna fill in for me.
- Great. Thank you.

03:47.554 --> 03:49.598
Which sister is this? No-Neck?

03:49.765 --> 03:52.976
No, not No-Neck. Another one.

03:53.143 --> 03:55.979
You have a sister named No-Neck?

03:56.146 --> 04:00.400
It's her nickname.
Everyone in my family has one.

04:00.567 --> 04:04.404
Just out of curiosity, Carla,
what's your nickname?

04:04.571 --> 04:08.033
- Muffin.
- You're kidding?

04:08.200 --> 04:10.410
What's wrong with Muffin?

04:10.577 --> 04:15.832
It's just an incredible coincidence.
You and I have the same nickname.

04:15.999 --> 04:17.793
No?

04:17.959 --> 04:23.215
Daddy always called me his muffin
because I was so sweet and toasty.

04:24.091 --> 04:29.804
I'm Muffin cos my brothers put yeast
in my ears and tried to bake my face.

04:35.393 --> 04:39.230
Should I ask what this sister's called
or will I regret it?

04:39.397 --> 04:43.818
Annette is different than the rest of us.
She's always been the good one.

04:43.985 --> 04:47.154
- Every family has its white sheep.
- You two close?

04:47.321 --> 04:52.368
We never spent much time together.
I only see her at family occasions.

04:52.535 --> 04:54.787
Weddings, holidays, stays of execution.

04:55.955 --> 04:59.542
Anyway, the thing about Annette,
she's reaI shy.

04:59.709 --> 05:02.586
A wallflower.
She doesn't have many friends.

05:02.753 --> 05:05.256
We'll take care of her.
When are we gonna meet her?

05:05.423 --> 05:08.091
Soon. I've been in labour
for four minutes.

05:08.258 --> 05:13.596
- It was my funny face, wasn't it?
- Why didn't you say something?

05:13.763 --> 05:16.725
I tried to hold out
untiI my customers left.

05:16.891 --> 05:19.269
It was my last shot at a pity tip.

05:19.436 --> 05:23.148
MaiI it to me.
I'll be at Saint Elygius HospitaI.

05:23.314 --> 05:27.068
Enjoy your drinks
while I'm under the knife.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.504
I'm Carla's sister, Annette Lozupone.

05:47.671 --> 05:51.592
What an interesting name.
How do you pronounce it?

05:55.929 --> 05:59.933
- Lozupone.
- Gee, just like it sounds.

06:01.518 --> 06:04.563
- Hi, Annette. I'm Sam.
- Hi.

06:04.730 --> 06:08.150
We've been waiting for you.
I see you already met Coach.

06:09.401 --> 06:11.945
He must be a good worker.

06:12.112 --> 06:16.200
Let me introduce you around here.
That's Cliff, Annette.

06:16.366 --> 06:20.204
This is Norm. This is Diane Chambers.

06:20.370 --> 06:22.706
- Annette.
- Diane.

06:22.873 --> 06:27.251
Well, you must hear about me
from Carla all the time.

06:30.171 --> 06:36.552
- She didn't mention another waitress?
- I've heard her talk about Fishface.

06:37.386 --> 06:39.430
She quit.

06:40.515 --> 06:43.893
- Nice kid, that Annette.
- Yeah, she is, Coach.

06:44.060 --> 06:47.730
- Yeah, she's cute too.
- Cute?

06:48.940 --> 06:51.901
You like her there, Cliffo?

06:52.068 --> 06:55.530
- I just said she was cute.
- Are you gonna ask her out?

06:55.696 --> 06:57.240
No.

06:57.406 --> 06:59.825
You haven't had a date in months.

06:59.992 --> 07:05.456
There's an explanation that you
riffraffs probably wouldn't understand.

07:05.623 --> 07:08.708
I have impossibly high standards
for a woman.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.919
She has to like you, right?

07:13.129 --> 07:17.133
Excuse me. I'll get you a pad
and we'll get a tray.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.303
- Here's a penciI.
- OK, Coach. Thanks.

07:24.224 --> 07:29.020
You'd do her a favour if you asked
her out. She'd feeI more comfortable.

07:29.187 --> 07:33.316
Well, I don't know.
Maybe on the way out.

07:34.442 --> 07:36.486
Gotta go.

07:36.653 --> 07:40.156
So soon? The night's young
and it's your round.

07:40.323 --> 07:45.370
Got a big day tomorrow. They've asked
me to test-drive a new postaI vehicle.

07:45.537 --> 07:50.040
- How come they asked you?
- I've got the best safety record.

07:50.207 --> 07:54.253
- Never been near an accident.
- Not since you were born.

07:56.338 --> 08:00.009
Was that comment addressed to me,
PauI?

08:00.175 --> 08:05.973
No, Cliff. If it were addressed
to anybody, it'd get lost in the maiI.

08:11.562 --> 08:15.816
If I wasn't wearing this uniform,
I'd ask you to step outside.

08:15.983 --> 08:19.903
If you weren't wearing it,
we'd all step outside.

08:24.992 --> 08:26.994
Cliff? Annette.

08:28.579 --> 08:32.248
Excuse me. I just had
a sudden thought here.

08:32.414 --> 08:36.836
If you're not doing anything,
maybe we could go out if you want.

08:37.003 --> 08:41.006
Really? That sounds nice.

08:42.549 --> 08:48.514
Well, I'd better warn you. I'm going on
a speciaI assignment for the department.

08:48.681 --> 08:52.769
I've got no right
to ask you to wait for me.

08:53.853 --> 08:58.524
Here's my phone number
in case you make it.

08:58.691 --> 09:02.111
<i>- Great. Well, Auf Wiedersehen.
- Bye.</i>

09:04.572 --> 09:08.076
What do you think?
How's the new girI doing?

09:08.242 --> 09:13.455
Very well. That date with Cliff
is the second one she's made here.

09:13.622 --> 09:15.791
Really?

09:15.957 --> 09:19.711
Well, that's good.
She's breaking out of her shell.

09:19.878 --> 09:23.757
Sam, it's Cheers. It's a romantic bar.

09:23.924 --> 09:27.969
As many people fall in love here
as get sick.

09:28.762 --> 09:32.349
So what do you say? Maybe 1 am?

09:33.892 --> 09:36.269
That would be fine.

09:43.568 --> 09:48.365
- She's not what Carla thinks she is.
- Yes, she is. She's just...

09:48.532 --> 09:50.575
She's naive.

09:50.742 --> 09:55.663
Sam, I am an excellent judge
of character.

09:55.830 --> 09:58.791
And I say she's loose.

09:59.959 --> 10:06.215
Stop. She's not loose. I'll talk to her.
I'll keep her from getting into trouble.

10:06.382 --> 10:09.176
Annette, can I talk to you in my office?

10:10.970 --> 10:17.101
By the way, you'd do a lot better if you
stop meddling in other people's sex lives

10:17.268 --> 10:19.770
and concentrated on mine.

10:26.235 --> 10:30.072
That's great. That'll keep me
till the end of the minute.

10:34.826 --> 10:39.998
- Did I do something wrong?
- I just wanted a little talk with you.

10:40.164 --> 10:43.209
I know you haven't worked in bars
before

10:43.376 --> 10:46.713
and I wanted to explain
how men behave in bars.

10:46.879 --> 10:50.883
They have a few drinks, get a little high

10:51.050 --> 10:55.054
and get carried away
around a beautifuI new waitress.

10:55.221 --> 10:58.850
And, well, does this make any sense
to you?

10:59.017 --> 11:03.479
Why don't you we sit down here?
See, I thought maybe that...

11:05.231 --> 11:07.275
Take me, take me!

11:12.030 --> 11:14.072
Sam, telephone call.

11:14.239 --> 11:17.492
I'll just tell them you're breaking in
a new waitress.

11:17.659 --> 11:19.619
No! Coach!

11:29.249 --> 11:31.293
OK, folks. Almost ready.

11:34.129 --> 11:37.466
That was Cliff. He's feeling a lot better.
He's coming in.

11:37.632 --> 11:39.676
What happened to him anyway?

11:39.843 --> 11:43.055
He was doing his test drive
a few days ago.

11:43.221 --> 11:49.770
He stepped into a pothole, smashed his
leg, but he finished his route in pain.

11:49.936 --> 11:55.399
He figured those 1974 Christmas cards
couldn't wait another day.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.864
Annette? You're late again.

12:02.031 --> 12:06.243
I'm sorry. Would you like to take me
into your office and scold me?

12:08.454 --> 12:13.793
- Just maybe don't do it again.
- I won't.

12:17.880 --> 12:22.134
She's turned into
the thing that devoured Boston.

12:22.301 --> 12:25.930
- We've gotta tell Carla.
- No, we do not.

12:26.096 --> 12:29.475
It's none of our business
if she likes men.

12:29.642 --> 12:34.063
Loves men. She can do whatever
she wants with her sex life.

12:34.229 --> 12:36.272
It's in the Bill of Rights.

12:38.066 --> 12:40.818
Where is it in the Bill of Rights?

12:40.985 --> 12:45.907
Well, you know, the part about
the right to assemble and bear arms.

12:50.787 --> 12:54.082
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

12:54.249 --> 12:58.002
Hey. I thought you said
you weren't gonna call me stupid

12:58.169 --> 13:00.880
now that we're being intimate.

13:01.047 --> 13:05.552
No. I said I wouldn't call you stupid
while we're being intimate.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.515
OK, folks. The movie's ready.

13:10.682 --> 13:13.226
- I got the lights.
- Thanks, Sam.

13:13.393 --> 13:18.397
Sit down. Get nice and comfy.
Here we go. Everyone comfortable?

13:18.564 --> 13:24.653
This film I call "A Trip To The HospitaI
To Visit Carla

13:24.820 --> 13:27.823
And Her New Two-Day-Old Baby. "

13:27.990 --> 13:31.159
- I like it.
- Thanks, Sam.

13:33.036 --> 13:35.455
Here we are in the elevator.

13:35.622 --> 13:40.460
Those elevator doors are opening
and we go into Carla's room.

13:40.627 --> 13:43.380
And, yes, we go in...

13:43.547 --> 13:47.634
And... Oh, gee, I made a mistake.
That's the dead guy's room.

13:47.801 --> 13:52.431
The widow was so upset.
I tried to cheer her up with a gift.

13:52.597 --> 13:55.309
It just wasn't the right moment.

13:56.767 --> 13:59.312
Now, here we are.

13:59.478 --> 14:05.568
I'm on the right floor, and there's Carla's
room, I hope, and in we go.

14:05.735 --> 14:09.697
It is! All the kids were very good.

14:09.864 --> 14:15.119
They were on their good behaviour.
Then Anthony squirted his water pistoI.

14:15.286 --> 14:17.580
Here I am wiping the lens.

14:17.747 --> 14:23.044
And Seraphina grabbed the camera,
crawled under a bed

14:23.210 --> 14:26.797
and I begged her for it
and I had a heck of a time.

14:26.964 --> 14:29.633
Then Ann Marie jumped on my back.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.219
Coach, didn't you get
a shot of the baby?

14:32.386 --> 14:35.473
- There she is.
- Which one's Carla's?

14:35.639 --> 14:40.351
It's the little girI. Doesn't she look like
her mother? That's all.

14:40.518 --> 14:42.562
I got the lights.

14:51.279 --> 14:55.492
That was nice.
I'm glad I got to see the babies.

14:55.658 --> 14:58.328
You haven't been over there yet?

14:58.495 --> 15:04.084
I got as far as the hospitaI,
but I met the surgeon in the parking lot.

15:04.250 --> 15:08.421
We split a six-pack in his van.
What a nice fellow.

15:14.177 --> 15:18.597
- Hey, look here!
- Welcome back.

15:18.764 --> 15:22.976
When Cliffy comes marching home
again... Come here.

15:23.143 --> 15:25.187
Welcome home, Cliffo.

15:25.354 --> 15:29.483
Thank you, Coach.
Boy, I've missed you guys.

15:29.650 --> 15:31.693
Except PauI.

15:31.860 --> 15:34.530
- So, who wants to see it?
- No, not me.

15:34.696 --> 15:39.284
I can't stand that stuff. I can't even eat
an open-faced sandwich.

15:41.620 --> 15:44.081
It's almost gone now anyway.

15:44.248 --> 15:47.918
- A little sudso there, Cliff.
- Thank you, Coach.

15:48.085 --> 15:50.546
I had healing hands to help me.

15:50.712 --> 15:56.260
- You deviI!
- Some incredible, beautifuI hands.

15:56.426 --> 16:01.514
- He's been bitten by the love bug.
- You've found somebody?

16:01.681 --> 16:04.767
- Well...
- He did, he did.

16:04.934 --> 16:08.396
I never thought I was the kind of guy
to fall head over heels.

16:08.563 --> 16:11.107
Oh, God. It isn't Annette, is it?

16:11.274 --> 16:14.860
- Yeah.
- I'm so happy for you.

16:16.571 --> 16:19.198
Thank you, Diane. It's great.

16:19.365 --> 16:23.911
She doesn't know it yet,
but I'm gonna ask for her hand.

16:25.746 --> 16:28.374
- Annette?
- Isn't it something?

16:28.541 --> 16:32.670
Me and Carla's sweet little sister.
It's like fate?

16:32.837 --> 16:34.880
There she is.

16:38.050 --> 16:42.345
- Hiya, sweetheart.
- Hello there, handsome.

16:48.852 --> 16:52.856
Sam, I think we have to talk
in the back room.

16:53.023 --> 16:55.400
Why?

16:55.567 --> 17:01.781
<i>It's our weekly seminar on the use of
leitmotiv in the "Chanson de Roland".</i>

17:03.700 --> 17:07.329
Yeah. Boy, time really flies by,
doesn't it?

17:07.494 --> 17:12.083
- Norman, join us. Coach?
- Not me, Diane. Thank you, no.

17:12.250 --> 17:15.002
You're the guest speaker.

17:15.170 --> 17:17.297
Hey, this might be good.

17:26.137 --> 17:31.643
- We are confronted with a problem.
- If we tell him, we ruin his life.

17:31.810 --> 17:36.648
- What if we don't tell him?
- If we don't tell him, we ruin his life.

17:36.815 --> 17:40.277
Well, if I'm confused,
everybody must be.

17:43.989 --> 17:49.036
Cliff's a sweet guy. If anyone
can change Annette, he's the one.

17:49.203 --> 17:54.374
Maybe you're right.
I guess we've been pretty cynicaI.

17:54.541 --> 17:59.254
Who are we to judge?
Maybe Annette really loves Cliff.

17:59.421 --> 18:05.051
Face it. Love can be a rebirth
for any man and woman.

18:05.218 --> 18:10.681
- I feeI better about that.
- Wasn't it Dante who said...

18:18.356 --> 18:22.944
- Annette, would you get me a soda?
- Certainly.

18:23.111 --> 18:28.449
- Cliff is really something speciaI.
- Which one's Cliff?

18:32.578 --> 18:35.289
Let me tell him. I'm his best friend.

18:35.456 --> 18:39.335
- Talk to you in the back room?
- Sure, Norm.

18:41.169 --> 18:44.422
You sure?
This can destroy relationships.

18:44.589 --> 18:49.177
He should hear this from someone
who cares about him.

18:49.344 --> 18:51.930
See you later, sweetheart.

18:53.765 --> 18:58.895
- So what's going on, Norm?
- Nothing.

19:01.231 --> 19:05.777
- I can't talk to my buddy?
- Sure. No problem.

19:11.741 --> 19:13.952
So what's up?

19:14.119 --> 19:18.164
What would you say your definition
of friendship was?

19:18.331 --> 19:23.085
Annette's out there waiting for me.
Use a dictionary.

19:23.252 --> 19:28.257
Friendship is two guys who remember
the good times they shared.

19:28.424 --> 19:31.760
- That's good.
- Remember the times we shared?

19:31.927 --> 19:36.015
- Listen. If you want a few bucks...
- No. Cliff...

19:36.181 --> 19:40.769
Remember when you thought
that I was drinking too much?

19:40.936 --> 19:47.401
And you felt I really ought to stop.
As a friend, I appreciated that.

19:47.568 --> 19:51.739
- You didn't stop.
- I decided you were wrong, but...

19:52.698 --> 19:56.327
Remember when we took a squirt
on that guy's lawn?

19:58.704 --> 20:01.957
We killed his Jack in a Pulpit.

20:05.501 --> 20:10.757
What did you ask me back here for?
It wasn't to talk over the good times.

20:10.923 --> 20:13.676
Well, not just that.

20:15.303 --> 20:19.432
More like about... Annette.

20:20.933 --> 20:27.231
Norm. Look. When Annette and
me are married, it won't change us.

20:27.398 --> 20:32.070
Cliff, Annette's not as innocent
as you think she is.

20:35.114 --> 20:37.492
What's that supposed to mean?

20:37.658 --> 20:42.205
Since she's been working here,
she has been around.

20:43.331 --> 20:45.374
And... around.

20:48.418 --> 20:52.714
What are you saying this for?
Are you jealous?

20:52.881 --> 20:58.178
Because we're starting a new life
and the magic's left your relationship?

20:58.345 --> 21:03.350
More people have enjoyed Annette's
magic than Doug Henning's.

21:07.062 --> 21:11.066
Normie, I'll give you one second
to take that back.

21:13.902 --> 21:16.530
OK, I'll give you three.

21:26.872 --> 21:30.292
- Who's she been with?
- Everybody.

21:32.253 --> 21:34.713
You?

21:34.880 --> 21:38.092
Because you're married, right?

21:38.259 --> 21:44.265
If you're married to a woman like Vera,
you don't even think of extramaritaI sex.

21:44.431 --> 21:47.685
You try not to think about maritaI sex.

21:57.236 --> 21:59.697
So you're gonna hate me now?

22:03.033 --> 22:05.827
Hate her?

22:06.828 --> 22:08.663
Hate yourself?

22:08.830 --> 22:10.874
My choice too, yeah.

22:12.834 --> 22:14.961
I guess I should have known.

22:16.170 --> 22:20.884
She said she invented all those things
it takes years to learn.

22:23.219 --> 22:26.139
I guess I ought to thank you, Norm.

22:27.223 --> 22:29.976
It couldn't have been easy for you...

22:30.143 --> 22:34.105
- I hope I do the same for you one day.
- Thanks.

22:37.358 --> 22:42.697
- Come on. Let's get a beer.
- Are you kidding? The guys'II laugh.

22:42.864 --> 22:44.908
No one will laugh at you.

22:45.074 --> 22:48.952
They care about you
and know you're hurting.

22:49.119 --> 22:53.165
Anybody who laughs at you
has gotta answer to me.

22:55.125 --> 22:59.046
Normie, you're about the best friend
I ever had.

23:03.508 --> 23:05.552
You're mine.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.598
Wanna hug?

23:14.853 --> 23:16.813
Me neither.

23:16.980 --> 23:22.235
It's not like you pulled me
from a burning car wreck or anything.

23:57.603 --> 23:58.604
