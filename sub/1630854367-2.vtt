00:53.454 --> 00:54.953
So?

00:54.955 --> 00:57.122
-What?
-So what's it going to be?

00:58.559 --> 01:04.263
Would it be lame if I just
wanted to get drunk
on a beach with you?

01:04.331 --> 01:06.231
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

01:07.635 --> 01:11.103
Yo! He's ignoring me
on purpose.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.006
So go up to the bar.
It's not the Four Seasons!

01:14.008 --> 01:16.708
[Charles] It's not
the Four Seasons?
This will get his attention!

01:17.211 --> 01:19.812
Hey! Over here!

01:19.814 --> 01:23.949
You know what?
Every single time I need
something, he disappears.

01:25.820 --> 01:27.853
Now I gotta go to the can.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.955
When he comes back,

01:29.957 --> 01:33.125
can you get me one of
those fruity margheritas?
That's what I want.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.798
Mmm! Marcos! <i> Hola!</i>

01:39.800 --> 01:41.433
Hello ma'am. Sir.

01:41.535 --> 01:45.104
Marcos, just Ben,
and Rose, <i> por favor.</i>

01:45.106 --> 01:48.907
Of course. What can I do
for you guys?
I mean, Rose.

01:50.845 --> 01:54.913
Oh! Yeah! Um, this is for you.

01:56.117 --> 02:00.719
This is far too
generous. I, I...

02:00.721 --> 02:04.356
We insist. You have made us
feel so welcome here.

02:04.425 --> 02:08.127
I am so glad you have
enjoyed your stay
at Secret Refuge.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.994
-[Ben] <i> Gracias!</i>
-[Marcos] <i> De nada.</i>

02:11.932 --> 02:17.636
Sorry for all the commotion
earlier. I think Charles has
had just a little too much...

02:17.738 --> 02:18.870
Sun?

02:18.872 --> 02:23.242
I was going to say rum!
Let me make it up to you.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.912
Listen. Our friends came here
last year,

02:26.914 --> 02:30.849
and they told us about
this incredible secret beach.

02:30.951 --> 02:34.653
We went yesterday. Amazing.
Completely deserted.

02:34.722 --> 02:38.490
You go, you can have
a couple of drinks,
make love on the sand.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.827
Where exactly is
that paradise?

02:41.829 --> 02:44.429
You go to the gate at
the western edge
of the resort,

02:44.431 --> 02:46.131
then take the path
for 20 minutes.

02:50.938 --> 02:54.406
I thought we weren't
supposed to leave
the resort? Like, ever?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.343
Where is your
sense of adventure?

03:20.634 --> 03:23.802
[Ben] We wouldn't be able
to do this stuff
if we had kids.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.904
[Rose] But you'd be
such a great dad!

03:25.906 --> 03:30.309
[Ben] I want a little
more time. Just us.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.245
We'll always have us,
I promise.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.603
[phone chimes]

04:31.038 --> 04:36.608
-C'mon, Rose! Get in here!
-I'm good.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.313
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

05:25.659 --> 05:29.928
I always know the vacation
is officially over when
the vacuum comes out.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.164
Joke all you want,
but the system works.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.465
I forgot about the system.

05:34.467 --> 05:39.037
Which only works because
that hotel didn't have
any bed bugs.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.541
The system works
because even if it did,

05:42.609 --> 05:45.711
they wouldn't survive
long enough to
infest our lovely home.

05:45.713 --> 05:49.614
Cool, whatever makes
you sleep better.

[Rose] That's going to be you,

05:58.425 --> 06:00.859

What's up with your face?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.755
What is it?

06:29.856 --> 06:33.658
It's... I don't know,
it's like a little bite.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.630
If that resort gave me
bed bugs, I'm going to
freak out.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.800
I'm sure it's not bed bugs.

06:41.802 --> 06:47.639
It's probably, like,
mosquito bite or something?
Nothing to worry about.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.711
Rose...

07:42.863 --> 07:44.563
Ben, wake up!

07:45.933 --> 07:49.534
-[Ben] What time is it?
-Look! Look, it got worse!

07:55.943 --> 07:58.710
That's what bites do.
They swell up,
before getting better.

07:58.712 --> 08:02.113
I have never had a bite
like this before!
Feel my forehead!

08:06.153 --> 08:10.489
Okay, you are a little
bit warm but that
doesn't mean anything!

08:10.491 --> 08:12.157
We brought back bed bugs!

08:14.328 --> 08:21.900
Honey, you are overreacting,
okay? It's just a little bite.

08:21.902 --> 08:26.104
I'm telling you,
something is wrong.
I can feel it.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.040
First thing in the morning,
we're going to call
Dr. Rendell,

08:29.142 --> 08:32.944
and we'll sort this out.
Right? Now, go back to sleep.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.412
You're going to feel better
in the morning.

08:57.504 --> 09:03.708
-[doctor] Chin up.
Does it hurt when you swallow?
-No.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.611
-[doctor] Is your throat sore?
-[Rose] No.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.813
Any nausea?

09:08.815 --> 09:12.918
No, but I've had
a terrible headache
for the last two days.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.421
Okay. Well, the good news is,
it isn't bed bugs.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.556
How do you know?

09:18.558 --> 09:21.426
They tend to feed in a
straight line. Their bites
don't swell like this.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.029
And the bad news?

09:24.031 --> 09:25.964
It's definitely a bite.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.434
-From what?
-Not sure. I haven't
seen one like this.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.503
Why don't you make
an appointment
to see a specialist?

09:33.307 --> 09:37.709
Her name is Dr. Polly. She's
an excellent dermatologist.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.545
But what if I can't get in
and it gets worse?

09:40.614 --> 09:45.317
I was reading about these
botflies, and they implant
larvae into your skin...

09:45.319 --> 09:47.018
Rose. It's not a botfly.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.855
Make the appointment
and check back with me
next week, okay?

09:51.725 --> 09:52.857
Okay.

09:57.464 --> 10:02.033
One more thing. Do me a favor.
Stay off the internet.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.938
Okay.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.998
Doom-scrolling the internet!
Great idea.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.040
Seriously, Dr. Google
won't have the answers.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.808
And neither did our doctor.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.111
What did he say?

10:46.113 --> 10:49.614
He wants me to see
a specialist, but I can't
get in for at least a week.

10:52.719 --> 10:53.952
Honey?

10:59.059 --> 11:00.425
It hurts.

11:04.631 --> 11:09.200
Maybe you should
drink water instead?

11:09.202 --> 11:14.506
Water. Right. Didn't think
of that. I guess Ben
always knows best!

11:15.909 --> 11:18.009
It's great to be treated
like an infant.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.477
[scoffs] Whoa.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.514
I'm just so sick of
being told what to do,
is that okay with you?

11:22.516 --> 11:26.051
I'm sorry, it's fine.
It was just a suggestion.
Do whatever you want.

It's okay.

12:04.024 --> 12:07.726
I just... I don't feel right.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.630
Something just feels
really wrong.

12:12.632 --> 12:17.102
It's fine.
We'll figure it out.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.504
Okay.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.951
-Feeling better?
-I think so.

to sort that out.

while we were away

placed inside your face.

will be minimal.
Don't worry about it.

come back.

<i> You're not the first.</i>

23:04.817 --> 23:07.318
Just tell me what's happening.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.288
<i> After the resort opened,</i>
<i> four years ago,</i>

23:11.290 --> 23:13.557
<i> staff members</i>
<i> started to disappear.</i>

23:13.659 --> 23:17.228
<i> They paid off</i>
<i> the family members</i>
<i> so it never made the news.</i>

23:17.230 --> 23:22.233
<i> But then, some guests</i>
<i> started to come back to the </i>
<i> acting strange.</i>

23:24.203 --> 23:26.303
What do you mean, strange?

23:26.305 --> 23:29.206
<i> One mother of four</i>
<i> drove her minivan</i>
<i> into oncoming traffic</i>

23:29.208 --> 23:31.442
<i> killing everyone inside.</i>

23:31.544 --> 23:34.945
<i> Another guy slaughtered</i>
<i> his whole family.</i>

23:35.014 --> 23:37.648
<i> Both had no prior history</i>
<i> of mental illness</i>

23:37.717 --> 23:40.151
<i> but there was a connection.</i>

23:40.219 --> 23:42.853
They both left the compound.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.357
What's causing it?

23:47.359 --> 23:50.428
<i> That resort</i>
<i> was once surrounded</i>
<i> by untouched rainforest.</i>

23:50.430 --> 23:52.430
<i> Who knows what was</i>
<i> in that jungle?</i>

23:52.432 --> 23:56.600
<i> Maybe it's a virus</i>
<i> or a feral cat</i>
<i> or a new bacteria or--</i>

23:59.005 --> 24:00.104
Hello?

24:47.119 --> 24:48.018
[door closes]

24:52.859 --> 24:56.627
[rummaging]

25:35.034 --> 25:36.000
Rose.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.236
I missed you so much.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.205
I missed you too, but

25:42.308 --> 25:43.741
what are you doing here?

25:44.744 --> 25:47.144
They said I could leave.
Isn't it great?

25:48.180 --> 25:50.014
My God.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.149
Why didn't you call
for a ride?

25:52.217 --> 25:54.852
I took an Uber.
I didn't want to wake you.

25:55.821 --> 26:00.024
So no follow-ups or anything?

26:00.026 --> 26:03.360
No. They said
everything looks great.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.698
I thought you'd be happy
to see me.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.600
Of course I am.

26:09.602 --> 26:12.536
But I've been worried sick
about you.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.505
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.106
What did they say
about the test results?

26:16.108 --> 26:18.008
Let's talk about it
after I've showered.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.610
I feel disgusting.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.345
Yeah, of course.

26:24.517 --> 26:25.416
Ben.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.252
I'm fine.

26:29.522 --> 26:31.522
Everything's going to be
fine now.

<i> My sister.</i>

28:59.205 --> 29:00.804
<i> Her name was Helena.</i>

29:19.625 --> 29:21.058
<i> They locked her up.</i>

Why?

29:22.828 --> 29:25.162

It was a bite,
wasn't it?

29:37.810 --> 29:38.809
[whispers] From a spider?

29:40.079 --> 29:41.511
[Marcos on phone] <i> Yes.</i>

29:41.513 --> 29:43.113
<i> They found them when</i>
<i> they were building</i>
<i> the resort.</i>

29:44.049 --> 29:45.749
<i> No one had ever</i>
<i> seen them before.</i>

29:45.785 --> 29:48.719
There's got to be
something we can do,
I mean...

29:48.721 --> 29:51.922
[Marcos on phone]
<i> People think the spiders</i>
<i> lay eggs in the bite.</i>

29:51.924 --> 29:54.725
<i> Once they hatch,</i>
<i> they burrow into your body</i>

29:55.427 --> 29:56.393

-No, no, Marcos, please.

to your sister.

[Marcos] <i> Uh, I can't tell yo</i>

30:11.944 --> 30:15.245

-Marcos, Marcos!

What are you doing?

I have to get you
to the hospital.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.963
You need help, okay?

33:55.100 --> 33:56.400
It's almost time.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.102
It's not your fault, okay?

34:02.941 --> 34:04.141
[Ben whispers]
What are you doing?

34:15.154 --> 34:16.019
Look.

34:16.822 --> 34:17.854
She's here.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.226
Rose, Rose, no.

34:24.029 --> 34:24.828
Rose!

34:25.431 --> 34:26.530
Rose, let me go!

34:27.933 --> 34:29.132
Let me go now!

34:31.336 --> 34:34.304
This will be so much easier
for you if don't struggle.

34:36.308 --> 34:37.107
[quietly] Rose.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.510
I know you're in there.

34:40.512 --> 34:41.812
This is not you.

34:43.849 --> 34:44.948
Isn't it, Ben?

34:47.052 --> 34:49.719
Why don't you tell me
exactly who I am then?

34:50.856 --> 34:52.522
Rose, we can fix this.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.423
We can fix it.

34:54.726 --> 34:55.525
We can fix it.

34:56.061 --> 34:57.060
[Rose gags]

34:58.730 --> 34:59.763
[continues gagging]

35:13.946 --> 35:14.744
[Ben] No!

35:17.216 --> 35:18.048
No, don't.

35:18.117 --> 35:18.949
Be still.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.252
Please, no, no, please.

35:41.507 --> 35:42.539

[weakly] Please.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.430
Please, would you just

36:08.500 --> 36:10.834
kill me?

36:12.337 --> 36:14.538
[Rose] I always knew
you'd make a good father.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.800
All right, that was <i> The Bite</i>

36:43.802 --> 36:46.102
One of my favorite
urban legends,

36:46.104 --> 36:49.406
and I'm now joined
by the director of <i> The Bite</i>
Justin Harding.

36:49.942 --> 36:51.041
Good to see you, Justin.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.609
-Good to see you, Eli.
-All right.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.212
Justin, tell us the story
of <i> The Bite.</i>

36:55.214 --> 36:58.515
I really like what we did
with the story because
to me the, um,

36:58.517 --> 37:01.218
you know, <i> The Bite</i>  really,
it really represents like

37:01.220 --> 37:03.353
-the vulnerability
of the human body, right?
-Yes.

37:03.422 --> 37:06.122
This urban legend
really taps into
the fear of invasion,

37:06.124 --> 37:08.058
and some foreign object
invading your body.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.260
-It's a great metaphor
for like pregnancy.
-It is.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.696
It's literally a fear
of pregnancy.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.764
-[Justin] Yeah.
-But it's not your choice.

37:14.833 --> 37:18.101
-It's someone else using
you to grow their eggs.
-Yeah.

37:18.103 --> 37:20.237
Exactly, and I'll never
experience the fear
of pregnancy,

37:20.305 --> 37:22.038
but it does tap into
a personal fear of mine

37:22.107 --> 37:25.742
which is dealing
with something
that's in your body,

37:25.844 --> 37:28.411
ah, like a disease
or something that doctors
can't diagnose,

37:28.413 --> 37:30.046
that they can't understand.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.349
Going to your loved ones
and to caregivers

37:32.417 --> 37:33.583
and telling them
something's wrong with me,

37:33.585 --> 37:35.252
there's something inside
of me, and having those people

37:35.320 --> 37:37.821
who are supposed to be
your loved ones minimize
what you're saying

37:37.923 --> 37:40.624
and sort of brush it off,
meanwhile, you know your body,
you know what's coming.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.425
That to me is where
we took the story,

37:42.427 --> 37:45.295
and built on top
of the legend into
a character driven story

37:45.297 --> 37:46.763
in this relationship.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.599
Yeah, you're totally healthy
and then some germ
invades your body,

37:49.601 --> 37:52.302
and takes it over
and you realize how
vulnerable you are.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.770
The human body
is incredibly vulnerable

37:53.772 --> 37:57.007
and we walk around
in these skin suits,
you know, all day.

37:57.009 --> 37:59.442
We're at risk constantly,
and it's a nice universal fear

37:59.511 --> 38:02.212
to play with in a horror film
because you get to take
that anxiety for a walk.

38:16.528 --> 38:17.427
[scoffs]

38:17.429 --> 38:18.795
Doom scrolling the internet.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.430
Great idea.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.432
Also there's the fear
of foreign.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.800
-[Justin] Yeah.
-You know this idea

38:23.802 --> 38:25.402
that we want to go
to these places

38:25.404 --> 38:29.039
that are outside our
comfort zone which really
in my early films

38:29.041 --> 38:31.741
the, you're from the safety
of the suburbs,

38:31.810 --> 38:33.843
you want to go far off
the beaten path,

38:33.912 --> 38:36.446
but that actually gets
you into danger

38:36.548 --> 38:37.947
you're not ready to handle,

38:37.949 --> 38:41.051
and I like the idea of like

38:41.119 --> 38:43.720
they're at, they're trying
to be at the main resort,

38:43.722 --> 38:46.122
but there's just too many
obnoxious people around,

38:46.124 --> 38:48.425
and it's like, no, no, no,
go to this place.

38:48.427 --> 38:51.394
It's off the beaten path
but of course that's
where the...

38:51.396 --> 38:53.730
-you know, spiders are.
-[Justin] Everybody wants
to go somewhere special,

38:53.732 --> 38:55.465
somewhere unique
and meanwhile, you know,

38:55.467 --> 38:57.901
you can end up invading
some other environment
that you're supposed to be in.

38:57.903 --> 39:00.303
-[Eli] Yes.
-So it touches on the theme
of invasion again.

39:00.305 --> 39:01.838
I think all of us too,
you know,

39:01.940 --> 39:03.373
globally coming out
of the pandemic,

39:03.375 --> 39:06.042
you know, you've,
everyone can relate
to the fear of your body

39:06.044 --> 39:08.211
just being invaded with
some virus or some thing

39:08.213 --> 39:11.548
-and--
-It's interesting 'cause
the two episodes you directed

39:11.649 --> 39:15.919
-both <i> The Red Room</i>
and <i> The Bite</i>  are body horro.
-Mmm-hmm.

39:15.921 --> 39:18.421
Very kind of similar in tone

39:18.423 --> 39:22.125
<i> Hostel</i>  and <i> Cabin Fever,</i>
my early films,

39:22.127 --> 39:25.061
and it's something
that fascinated me

39:25.063 --> 39:26.830
that that was one
of the reasons why

39:26.832 --> 39:30.033
I was, I wanted to do these
as <i> Urban Legends.</i>

39:30.102 --> 39:32.035
Everybody has that
body horror fear.

39:32.104 --> 39:34.037
I mean, some of my favorite
films are body horror films.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.172
I think like <i> Aliens</i>
is probably my favorite.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.742
-Mmm.
-And an extreme level,
or even more recently like

39:38.810 --> 39:42.011
the <i> Black Swan</i>  I feel is lie
an interesting creative,
you know, body horror.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.214
Well, even in that deleted
scene in the first <i> Alien</i>

39:44.216 --> 39:46.549
where, you know,
Dallas is alive

39:46.651 --> 39:48.752
and they're being used
to gestate the egg.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.053
-That was like...
-Yeah.

39:50.122 --> 39:52.288
I remember reading
the novelization

39:52.290 --> 39:54.924
-of <i> Alien</i>  and being like,
"What?"
-[Justin] Yeah.

39:54.926 --> 39:58.328
Just the idea of being
used for some other
creature's eggs

39:58.330 --> 40:00.530
<i> -is a terrifying thought.</i>
-[Justin] <i> It is terrifying.</i>

40:07.038 --> 40:07.904
Look.

40:08.807 --> 40:09.606
She's here.

40:14.212 --> 40:16.346
Rose, Rose, no. Rose!

40:17.349 --> 40:18.515
Rose, let me go!

40:19.518 --> 40:20.983
Let me go now!

40:23.221 --> 40:26.356
This would be so
much easier for you
if you didn't struggle.

40:26.425 --> 40:27.824
[Eli] <i> Let's talk</i>
<i> about shooting.</i>

40:27.826 --> 40:30.760
You know, every episode
is gonna have it's kind of
centerpiece

40:30.829 --> 40:33.096
horror scene and kill scene.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.731
-[Justin] Yeah.
-Talk about shooting
that scene.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.934
It's the buildup,
the pus and then,
of course, the ultimate

40:38.036 --> 40:40.003
reveal of the spiders
coming out of the face.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.104
What was your approach?

40:41.106 --> 40:43.940
How much was practical,
how much was CGI,

40:44.008 --> 40:45.575
and how did you pull it off?

40:45.577 --> 40:48.945
So, it's a combination,
the prosthetic effects
on her are practical,

40:49.014 --> 40:51.748
so she's wearing the bite,
the welt.

40:51.817 --> 40:54.050
There's a physical hair
inside of it.

40:54.152 --> 40:57.020
When she's pulling
on it, she's pulling on
that prosthetic.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.922
-So that's all practical
and then it's all performance.
-[door bangs]

40:58.924 --> 41:00.123
Let me in!

41:00.125 --> 41:01.057
-[skittering]
-[door thumping]

41:01.126 --> 41:02.292
Open the door!

41:02.294 --> 41:03.326
[Rose screams]

41:07.132 --> 41:08.598
-[thump]
-Rose!

41:08.600 --> 41:10.900
-[handle clacks]
-Rose, what's happening
to you?

41:10.902 --> 41:13.002
My wife right now
is pregnant, she's like
five months pregnant,

41:13.004 --> 41:15.705
there's definitely an invasion
in our home,
there's something growing.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.207
-Yeah, well, there's
something, you know...
-[Justin chuckles]

41:17.209 --> 41:19.809
...very, very primal.
It's the only reason
we're here.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.545
-Mmm-hmm.
-We only got here because
we were an egg at some point.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.113
So I think that

41:24.115 --> 41:27.951
everybody knows that they,
at one point, were
the invading species.

41:27.953 --> 41:31.754
And then it's fine when we're
the invaders, but we don't
want to get invaded.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.991
What advice would
you give out there
to aspiring directors

41:34.993 --> 41:37.260
that want to be in
the director's seat
where you are now?

41:37.329 --> 41:39.729
My advice would be
fix it in prep.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.364
Don't try to fix
things in post.

41:41.433 --> 41:43.299
Like really prepare
your shot list
and storyboards,

41:43.301 --> 41:44.834
so that you can focus
on the storytelling,

41:44.903 --> 41:47.203
'cause to me it's all
about the actor's performance,

41:47.205 --> 41:48.771
and the more you prep,

41:48.773 --> 41:50.974
and the more you get
the filmmaking, cameras,
and editing off your plate,

41:50.976 --> 41:52.442
the more time you have
with the actors.

41:52.444 --> 41:54.811
I just want to say,
I think I'm such a fan
of yours, Justin.

41:54.813 --> 41:58.314
Like I really think you're
a superbly talented director

41:58.316 --> 41:59.716
and are going to go
on to do amazing things.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.150
This is surreal,
this isn't real life.
