00:00.751 --> 00:03.326
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.326 --> 00:06.499
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.499 --> 00:08.362
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.362 --> 00:10.927
These are their stories.

Gentlemen!

01:01.978 --> 01:03.145
Aim!

01:14.431 --> 01:15.669
Fire!

01:35.866 --> 01:37.809
You can get up now, judge.

01:38.809 --> 01:40.097
Judge?

01:41.930 --> 01:44.176
You guys stay right here
until I come back.

01:44.176 --> 01:46.107
Do not move.

01:47.502 --> 01:49.795
Police. Stand back.

01:50.884 --> 01:52.751
Oh, no, please God!

02:01.710 --> 02:04.008
He's gone. / No.

02:05.673 --> 02:07.207
Tommy!

02:07.207 --> 02:09.443
Tommy, no!

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2007/02/06

02:57.912 --> 03:02.423
Judge Thomas Layton was re-enacting
the Hamilton-Burr duel.

03:02.423 --> 03:04.345
Has anybody left the island?

03:04.345 --> 03:05.799
No one, not even my boys.

03:05.799 --> 03:08.541
Your boys?
Are they okay?

03:08.541 --> 03:09.729
Considering.

03:09.729 --> 03:13.542
I put them to work collecting
camcorders from the crowd.

03:13.542 --> 03:16.597
Is that Maureen Pagolis with them?

03:16.597 --> 03:18.542
The former state senator herself.

03:18.542 --> 03:22.185
The man in blue is her husband, George,
the former embezzler.

03:22.185 --> 03:23.295
He played Burr.

03:23.295 --> 03:27.222
So the entry wound is through his back.

03:27.945 --> 03:29.642
How many gunshots did you hear?

03:29.642 --> 03:32.711
Just two, from the pistols.

03:34.110 --> 03:40.969
Well, if there had been a boat,
you would've seen it or heard it.

03:40.969 --> 03:44.656
So that means that the kill shot
came from over there?

03:44.913 --> 03:46.402
Cross the river?

03:46.402 --> 03:51.023
That was to be a mile away.
Hell of a shot.

03:53.739 --> 03:56.924
Why would he be wearing
a bulletproof vest to a re-enactment?

03:56.924 --> 04:00.320
I don't know, but if a bullet came across
the East river and pierced armor,

04:00.320 --> 04:01.974
this is a military hit.

04:01.974 --> 04:03.406
It's crazy, huh?

04:03.406 --> 04:07.407
My wife makes me do this duel thing,
and then Tommy gets shot for real.

04:07.407 --> 04:09.002
You knew the judge.

04:09.002 --> 04:10.501
Well, 15 years.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.461
Maureen went to work for him
when she got out of Yale.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.279
Tommy was my mentor and first boss.

04:15.279 --> 04:17.024
He's the reason I got
into public service.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.176
I'm Maureen Pagolis.

04:18.176 --> 04:21.711
You spoke at my academy
graduation ceremony.

04:21.711 --> 04:23.318
So what happened here?

04:23.318 --> 04:25.348
Was one of the pistols
loaded with real ammunition?

04:25.348 --> 04:28.329
Maureen, he got shot in the back, huh?

04:28.329 --> 04:30.788
I knew the second he fell
it wasn't the way we rehearsed it.

04:30.788 --> 04:33.604
- You rehearsed this?
- Yeah, last Sunday.

04:33.604 --> 04:35.942
It's history, right?
Can't fake it.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.455
Got it.

04:39.118 --> 04:40.535
What the hell is that?

04:40.535 --> 04:44.641
This is business end of the new
418-grain tungsten penetrator.

04:44.641 --> 04:47.583
The whole bullet's four inches long.
It looks like a little missile.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.244
There's only one gun
in the world that shoots it.

04:49.244 --> 04:52.409
Cheytac long range sniper rifle.

04:52.409 --> 04:55.273
Give me 20 minutes, I'll tell you
where it was fired from.

04:56.692 --> 04:59.789
Whoa. It's windy up here.

04:59.789 --> 05:02.449
The Cheytac comes with
its own handheld weather station,

05:02.449 --> 05:04.339
a wrist computer
to measure the slant angle,

05:04.339 --> 05:06.655
and a separate ballistic computer.

05:06.655 --> 05:10.493
It corrects for wind, air temp,
and spin of the earth.

05:10.493 --> 05:11.591
Piece of cake.

05:11.591 --> 05:14.778
For maybe five or six guys
on the eastern seaboard.

05:14.778 --> 05:16.649
Your guy's a pro.

05:17.449 --> 05:22.035
He would need a smart nest
to snipe from.

05:27.563 --> 05:30.586
This is sheltered
from the other buildings.

05:30.586 --> 05:32.108
How big is this gun?

05:32.108 --> 05:33.824
Well, it's designed for easy infiltration,

05:33.824 --> 05:35.439
so he could've carried it
in a large case,

05:35.439 --> 05:38.338
assembled it up here,
easy teardown afterwards.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.794
This gun is not a shoulder mount.

05:39.794 --> 05:41.528
He probably used a bi-pod.

05:41.528 --> 05:44.043
These scratch marks
could be from the recoil.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.741
Took the shell casing with him.

05:45.741 --> 05:48.397
- Shells come out hot?
- Very.

05:48.397 --> 05:50.480
To the right of the weapon.

05:54.182 --> 05:56.277
Our shooter was here.

05:57.998 --> 06:03.870
A duel re-enactment gone bad
involving scandal-plagued George Pagolis,

06:03.870 --> 06:06.616
bad boy husband of Maureen Pagolis,

06:06.616 --> 06:10.351
is seen as yet another blow
to her political career.

06:10.351 --> 06:15.912
Not only was George previously indicted
for embezzlement and perjury,

06:15.912 --> 06:21.901
he's been a material witness in connection
with several mob investigations.

06:21.901 --> 06:25.264
The tabloid press has caught
him time and time again

06:25.264 --> 06:28.567
flagrantly escorting
young lovelies around town.

06:28.567 --> 06:32.372
No politician in New York has done
more work for women than Maureen Pagolis.

06:32.372 --> 06:35.341
The, um, shelters,
the childcare programs.

06:35.341 --> 06:37.320
She's been absolutely amazing.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.258
She's done a ton of fund-raising
for battered women.

06:40.258 --> 06:43.656
I mean, I just don't understand
why people have to judge her personal life

06:43.656 --> 06:45.655
based on what her husband does.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.648
Which has absolutely nothing
to do with all of her good work.

06:49.302 --> 06:50.954
Sister, I am begging you.

06:50.954 --> 06:53.581
Would you drop the dead weight already?

06:54.581 --> 06:58.197
A woman politician taking the fall
for her corrupt husband.

06:58.197 --> 07:00.845
You never see it go the other way.

07:01.432 --> 07:03.836
You look up to her, don't you?

07:04.368 --> 07:05.636
Very much.

07:05.636 --> 07:07.480
Word to the wise.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.402
Don't let that get in the way
of your investigation.

07:15.175 --> 07:17.287
Right after you two
left Governors island,

07:17.287 --> 07:19.208
a private boat pulls up.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.966
Turns out Pagolis called his chauffer.

07:21.966 --> 07:23.257
Didn't want to wait for the ferry.

07:23.257 --> 07:26.519
Maureen Pagolis went along with that?
She's not the type to pull rank.

07:26.519 --> 07:29.331
She didn't. She stayed with
the judge's body till it was moved.

07:29.331 --> 07:31.924
She called his family,
thanked every officer individually.

07:31.924 --> 07:35.124
And then cried on cue for the TV news.

07:35.124 --> 07:37.394
You sound cynical about Mrs. Pagolis.

07:37.394 --> 07:40.205
Well, she is angling to be
the city's first woman mayor.

07:40.205 --> 07:42.989
She was also a very good
friend of the judge.

07:42.989 --> 07:44.777
So she should know
why he was wearing a vest.

07:44.777 --> 07:48.604
She didn't,
but the US attorney's office did.

07:48.604 --> 07:52.399
A prison wire tap picked up a threat
on judge Layton's life late last week.

07:52.399 --> 07:57.156
He turned down a security detail,
but agreed to the vest.

07:57.462 --> 08:00.665
So the threat you picked up
against judge Layton wasn't viable?

08:00.665 --> 08:03.585
No, some wannabe Goomba knew
we were wire tapping him,

08:03.585 --> 08:06.124
so he made some death threats
just to jerk us around.

08:06.124 --> 08:07.636
You didn't get a chance
to tell the judge.

08:07.636 --> 08:09.546
Well, we tried to contact
the judge this afternoon

08:09.546 --> 08:12.470
to tell them to take the vest off.
He'd already been shot.

08:12.470 --> 08:13.854
If you're looking for suspects,

08:13.854 --> 08:18.355
the US attorney's office betting pool
is six to one, George Pagolis.

08:21.241 --> 08:23.395
How come Maureen stays
married to Pagolis

08:23.395 --> 08:25.367
no matter how many times
he cheats on her,

08:25.367 --> 08:28.146
or he gets indicted?

08:28.146 --> 08:30.148
Like my mother would say,
you know, if she stays in it,

08:30.148 --> 08:31.889
she must be getting something out of it.

08:31.889 --> 08:33.976
Maybe Maureen's loyal to a fault.

08:33.976 --> 08:40.736
Or maybe she depends on his construction
company to finance her campaigns.

08:40.736 --> 08:42.927
Well, he may have financed
her first campaigns,

08:42.927 --> 08:45.494
he sabotaged her last ones.

08:45.494 --> 08:47.792
His timing's impeccable.

08:47.792 --> 08:49.321
The minute she announced for senate,

08:49.321 --> 08:51.777
the story of his love nest
is all over the papers.

08:51.777 --> 08:56.335
When she was up for that cabinet post,
he went down for embezzlement.

08:58.124 --> 08:59.837
What?

08:59.837 --> 09:02.233
Impeccable timing.

09:02.233 --> 09:06.775
How did the sniper know when to
pull the trigger from so far away?

09:13.688 --> 09:16.873
- Okay, what am I missing?
- Well, the shooter,

09:16.873 --> 09:20.414
he'd want to time his shot
exactly with the duel,

09:20.414 --> 09:24.346
so he would enlist the duel master.

09:25.785 --> 09:27.794
You see? He's signaling.

09:27.794 --> 09:30.256
Now, that little salute,
in American sign language,

09:30.256 --> 09:32.584
that means "gentlemen."

09:33.966 --> 09:37.795
Then, see, he points.

09:37.795 --> 09:39.414
That's "aim."

09:39.414 --> 09:40.937
And then...

09:43.435 --> 09:44.928
- "fire."
- Why bother?

09:44.928 --> 09:47.760
Why not just shoot him
the first time he had a clear shot?

09:47.760 --> 09:50.773
A guy that can pin a shot like this,
he's like a...

09:50.773 --> 09:52.081
a Swiss watchmaker.

09:52.081 --> 09:55.840
He'd not only want to accurate,
he'd want to be elegant.

10:12.814 --> 10:13.939
Thank you.

10:16.239 --> 10:18.032
You okay, Mrs. P?

10:18.250 --> 10:19.984
I'm a wreck, Dave-O.

10:19.984 --> 10:21.540
No problem.

10:22.309 --> 10:24.089
You just hang in there.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.532
What, you gotta talk to everybody?

10:31.734 --> 10:34.478
It's a funeral service,
not a fund-raiser.

10:35.126 --> 10:36.616
Where to?

10:36.616 --> 10:37.961
Home.

10:37.961 --> 10:39.762
The cemetery.

10:39.762 --> 10:43.278
Maureen, you've done enough.
You gave a beautiful eulogy.

10:43.278 --> 10:45.309
Tommy's gone!

10:57.124 --> 10:58.565
I make these.

10:58.565 --> 11:00.829
Nitrated paper blanks.

11:00.829 --> 11:04.391
They're ignited by the powder,
so we, uh, get a big bang,

11:04.391 --> 11:06.126
lots of smoke.

11:06.126 --> 11:08.359
And the hand signals?

11:09.245 --> 11:11.989
"Gentlemen, aim, fire."

11:11.989 --> 11:13.779
That got you a really big bang.

11:13.779 --> 11:15.343
No.

11:16.155 --> 11:17.629
No!

11:17.629 --> 11:19.335
You signaled someone, Mr. Few.

11:19.335 --> 11:20.575
I'm sorry.

11:20.575 --> 11:23.073
I try to remember not to sign,

11:23.073 --> 11:25.757
but sometimes when I'm nervous
I can't help it.

11:25.757 --> 11:30.203
My wife's deaf. We've been married
for 30 years, so...

11:33.147 --> 11:35.560
I talk with my hands, yes.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.823
So you weren't signaling the shooter?

11:37.823 --> 11:39.281
No!

11:39.629 --> 11:41.567
Of course not.

11:41.914 --> 11:43.664
Did you think...

11:44.617 --> 11:46.393
No.

11:47.943 --> 11:50.004
This blue jacket here
is out of place.

11:50.004 --> 11:52.511
I know, I know.

11:52.511 --> 11:55.263
Before Mr. Pagolis and
the judge traded costumes,

11:55.263 --> 11:57.268
we tried to find
the judge a larger size.

11:57.268 --> 11:59.332
It wouldn't button.

11:59.332 --> 12:01.165
My son brought it back.

12:01.165 --> 12:02.802
He doesn't care where they go.

12:02.802 --> 12:04.654
They traded costumes when?

12:04.654 --> 12:07.271
For the rehearsal,
the judge played Burr.

12:07.271 --> 12:09.817
But come the duel,
he's wearing a bulletproof vest.

12:09.817 --> 12:11.624
His blue jacket is too tight.

12:11.624 --> 12:13.784
We tried this one,
and then George says,

12:13.784 --> 12:17.456
"look, let's just switch.
I'll be Burr."

12:17.456 --> 12:19.536
Pagolis was supposed
to wear the gray.

12:19.536 --> 12:24.886
Yeah, he got shot in rehearsal,
but judge Layton got...

12:28.619 --> 12:31.596
Oh, dear.
So you think...

12:31.596 --> 12:35.769
Best shot of the killer's life
and he hit the wrong guy.

12:37.178 --> 12:38.929
The duel master was telling the truth.

12:38.929 --> 12:41.356
His wife has been deaf
since her teens.

12:41.356 --> 12:44.644
So the sniper took his own cue
aiming for the man in gray.

12:44.644 --> 12:45.829
George Pagolis.

12:45.829 --> 12:48.341
He has to suspect the hit
was meant for him.

12:48.341 --> 12:51.759
And somehow, he forgot
to mention that to us.

12:51.759 --> 12:54.840
Excuse us. Uh, we're here
to see George Pagolis.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.782
Mr. Pagolis is in session.

12:56.782 --> 12:59.294
Send him in, Manny.

13:00.311 --> 13:01.995
Detective.

13:01.995 --> 13:03.859
Uh, we can come back.

13:03.859 --> 13:05.819
Oh, sorry, didn't know
you brought your partner with.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.529
Throw a towel on me, will you?

13:08.529 --> 13:10.622
What can I do for you?

13:11.686 --> 13:15.416
We found out about your
last minute costume change.

13:15.416 --> 13:18.082
We wondered why you forgot
to mention it to us.

13:18.082 --> 13:19.527
Didn't seem important.

13:19.527 --> 13:21.888
The guy in gray got shot.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.724
Didn't seem like an important detail?

13:25.512 --> 13:28.370
Do you think this hit
was meant for you?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.108
You ever heard of Joe E. Lewis?

13:31.108 --> 13:32.791
Al Capone's favorite comedian.

13:32.791 --> 13:34.939
Al loved him.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.426
But one night,
this other thug's gal got,

13:37.426 --> 13:39.875
um, offended by a joke.

13:39.875 --> 13:43.219
Lewis winds up with
his throat slashed ear to ear.

13:43.219 --> 13:45.341
He's tough. He lives.

13:45.341 --> 13:49.344
The next day he tells a cop,
"I cut myself shaving."

13:49.344 --> 13:52.430
He ended up opening for Sinatra.
(ÇÁ·©Å© ½óªÆ®♪ó : ¹Ì±¹ÀÇ °¡¼ö, ¿µÈ­¹è¿ì)

13:52.633 --> 13:55.298
Do you know anyone who might
want you dead, Mr. Pagolis?

13:55.298 --> 13:58.140
Yeah, I do.

13:58.140 --> 14:00.300
Next question?

14:00.700 --> 14:02.508
Yamiko, good to see you, sweetie.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.199
I want to make sure you get
all the chalk off this time.

14:05.199 --> 14:07.173
Good-bye.

14:14.822 --> 14:17.347
You get the feeling there's
a long list of people

14:17.347 --> 14:19.794
who'd want this jerk dead?

14:19.794 --> 14:23.919
No one keeps better track of
their enemies than a politician.

14:23.919 --> 14:27.511
Look, if Pagolis won't talk to us,
maybe his wife will.

14:27.750 --> 14:31.875
Women politicians have a hard time
in terms of husbands.

14:31.875 --> 14:32.955
If they have one,

14:32.955 --> 14:37.018
that means that they're accused of
not being there for their family.

14:37.018 --> 14:40.090
She's an inspiration for all women,
you know, in this country.

14:40.090 --> 14:43.119
And she doesn't need
that guy on her side.

14:43.119 --> 14:46.711
She doesn't need to put up
with all the bad things.

14:46.711 --> 14:50.914
Judge Layton fought tirelessly
to protect women from abuse,

14:50.914 --> 14:53.755
at home and in the workplace.

14:53.755 --> 14:56.018
So while I am grieving today,

14:56.018 --> 14:59.336
I am also rededicating myself
to that struggle,

14:59.336 --> 15:01.858
as I hope you all will.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.609
Thank you.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.745
Yes, my husband is in construction,

15:10.745 --> 15:13.152
but that doesn't mean
that he's mobbed up

15:13.152 --> 15:15.248
or that someone
has put a hit on him.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.700
Mrs. Pagolis, your husband's
extracurricular activities

15:18.700 --> 15:20.552
could have made him a target.

15:20.552 --> 15:23.333
We need to know what you know.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.078
Detective...

15:25.379 --> 15:27.409
my husband is a human being.

15:27.409 --> 15:30.699
Our marriage has ups
and downs like any other.

15:30.699 --> 15:32.663
The only difference is
that our life is played out

15:32.663 --> 15:35.004
on the front pages of the newspapers.

15:35.004 --> 15:37.967
Makes the two of you easy targets.

15:37.967 --> 15:41.937
You know, the embezzlement,
the rumor about the affairs.

15:41.937 --> 15:44.102
I've read all the smears.

15:44.102 --> 15:47.275
But our three boys need their father.

15:47.275 --> 15:50.573
If I thought for a moment
that he was in danger,

15:50.573 --> 15:53.183
believe me, I would tell you.

15:53.183 --> 15:54.560
Now, I'm sorry.
If you'll excuse me,

15:54.560 --> 15:57.963
I really need to get back to
these young attorneys.

16:00.606 --> 16:02.272
She keeps her mask on.

16:02.272 --> 16:07.763
Well, she doesn't know who to trust,
between her husband and the press.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.327
She probably can't trust her own staff.

16:12.655 --> 16:15.176
Mrs. Pagolis, she'll be
up there for a while.

16:15.176 --> 16:18.158
Every event, she talks to everybody.
Won't say no.

16:18.158 --> 16:19.884
So she keeps you waiting?

16:19.884 --> 16:21.016
I don't mind.

16:21.016 --> 16:23.274
She's doing her job.
I do mine.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.924
Mr. Pagolis keep you waiting too?

16:26.439 --> 16:28.210
On occasion.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.991
Must be complicated, huh?

16:29.991 --> 16:33.550
I mean, you know, driving two people,
two separate lives.

16:33.550 --> 16:35.894
- I get paid.
- By Mr. Pagolis.

16:35.894 --> 16:37.338
That's right.

16:37.338 --> 16:40.579
I get paid to drive and
to keep my mouth shut.

16:41.203 --> 16:44.209
Puts you in a tough position
when Mrs. Pagolis asks you

16:44.209 --> 16:46.104
where her husband's been.

16:46.104 --> 16:48.579
She's too classy to ask.

16:48.579 --> 16:51.618
But she's smart. She knows.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.931
She tells me where she wants to go.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.620
I take her there.

16:55.620 --> 16:58.163
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna wait in the car.

16:58.163 --> 17:04.023
Mr. Oldren, you probably noticed
that we have a tail on Mr. Pagolis.

17:05.988 --> 17:08.859
It's only a matter of time.

17:11.178 --> 17:12.696
Fine, then.

17:12.696 --> 17:16.061
Tell your guy to stick close.
It's Wednesday night.

17:16.061 --> 17:17.651
Mr. Pagolis...

17:17.651 --> 17:19.627
he's a creature of habit.

17:23.804 --> 17:26.020
You got plans for the night?

17:26.797 --> 17:29.544
You know she's got everybody
convinced she's saving the world.

17:29.544 --> 17:31.928
I gotta tell you, it's pleasure
to spend time with somebody

17:31.928 --> 17:34.608
who's making calls and raising money
for social injustice

17:34.608 --> 17:37.056
in the middle of dinner, you know?

17:37.518 --> 17:38.938
Excuse me.

17:38.938 --> 17:40.526
Okay, sweetheart.

17:43.528 --> 17:45.580
It's about time.

17:51.248 --> 17:52.370
Yeah?

17:53.665 --> 17:55.615
George and I,
we're just good friends.

17:55.615 --> 17:57.123
Who dine till midnight.

17:57.123 --> 17:58.935
You ever pick up your friend's check?

17:58.935 --> 18:01.731
George would never let me.
He's a gentleman.

18:01.731 --> 18:04.542
You have any more questions,
you can call my husband.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.159
He's an attorney.

18:06.159 --> 18:07.687
Where is he tonight?

18:07.687 --> 18:10.720
Working. Like Maureen.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.517
George and I have a lot in common.

18:14.501 --> 18:17.191
Does your wife mind
you having so many...

18:17.191 --> 18:19.728
you know, beautiful, female friends?

18:19.728 --> 18:21.477
My wife's booked 8 nights a week.

18:21.477 --> 18:28.045
You know, she's got town hall meetings,
fund-raisers, benefits.

18:28.045 --> 18:32.402
In fact, she's having an award given to her
tonight in DC, you know.

18:32.402 --> 18:36.074
I guess you either understand it
or you resent it.

18:36.074 --> 18:40.008
Me? Well, let's just say
I hate to eat alone.

18:42.049 --> 18:45.100
Tell Silvio the veal was,
out of this world tonight.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.093
Yes, sir, Mr. Pagolis.

18:48.463 --> 18:51.572
Would we be having this discussion
if she was a male politician?

18:51.572 --> 18:55.077
I don't think so. We wouldn't be talking
about her husband and her kids.

18:55.077 --> 18:57.690
She's got class and style
and she fights for the city.

18:57.690 --> 18:58.949
I'd vote for her.

18:58.949 --> 19:01.831
But I don't like her husband
being that close to the city's money.

19:03.260 --> 19:04.926
Maureen.

19:05.143 --> 19:06.788
Were you expecting someone else?

19:06.788 --> 19:08.510
No, I thought you were in DC.

19:08.510 --> 19:09.956
Where is she?

19:09.956 --> 19:11.531
She's in your head, Maureen.

19:11.531 --> 19:13.351
Yeah, stop it.

19:13.351 --> 19:16.024
Come on, Mau, man's
gonna be a man, right?

19:16.024 --> 19:18.593
His wife's away,
he's gonna go someplace else.

19:18.593 --> 19:20.112
But now if the wife comes home...

19:20.112 --> 19:22.585
Oh, no, you don't lay a finger on me.

19:22.585 --> 19:25.180
- Where'd the boys go?
- They went to a Knicks game.

19:25.180 --> 19:28.021
I had five tickets.
We could've gone as a family, but...

19:28.021 --> 19:29.501
Oh, please.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.458
I have wanted to be your wife,
but you couldn't quit, could you?

19:32.458 --> 19:34.440
Not the women,
not the bribery, none of it.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.173
If you ever even think
about getting a divorce,

19:37.173 --> 19:41.359
every single check that's ever been
written to you is gonna get looked at.

19:41.359 --> 19:43.881
You'd be in a nursing home
before the investigation's over.

19:43.881 --> 19:45.932
I haven't done anything illegal.

19:45.932 --> 19:47.463
You don't know the half
of what you've done.

19:47.463 --> 19:49.350
Did you have anything
to do with Tommy's dying?

19:49.350 --> 19:50.152
That's funny, see,

19:50.152 --> 19:52.615
'cause I thought maybe it was you
who put the hit out on me.

19:52.615 --> 19:54.867
I've certainly wanted
you dead, George.

19:54.867 --> 19:56.773
But it's not a crime
to want someone dead.

19:56.773 --> 19:58.774
- Oh, you little spitfire!
- Let me go!

19:58.774 --> 20:00.704
- Oh, baby!
- I told you to let me go!

20:00.704 --> 20:02.963
- Baby!
- I am not kidding you!

20:04.494 --> 20:05.736
Perfect.

20:06.017 --> 20:07.269
Thank you.

20:07.269 --> 20:11.215
All right. How great to meet
all you wonderful gals!

20:11.215 --> 20:13.490
You're just beautiful and talented.

20:13.490 --> 20:15.793
Bye-bye.
Thanks for being here.

20:15.793 --> 20:17.250
Thank you.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.207
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!

20:20.655 --> 20:21.798
Mrs. Pagolis.

20:21.798 --> 20:24.609
Detectives, I have a court date
on behalf of a women's shelter.

20:24.609 --> 20:27.456
We only need a minute.
It's about your husband.

20:27.456 --> 20:28.679
Yes.

20:28.679 --> 20:31.958
He told that you've been stalking him.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.098
We're detectives.
We don't stalk.

20:34.098 --> 20:35.839
Do you still think
that he was the target?

20:35.839 --> 20:37.254
We're not sure.

20:37.254 --> 20:38.930
That far away,

20:38.930 --> 20:41.549
the shooter had to be told,
"get the guy in gray."

20:41.549 --> 20:43.237
So if the hit was meant for the judge,

20:43.237 --> 20:45.765
then somebody told the sniper
about the costume change,

20:45.765 --> 20:47.254
and the only people
who knew about the costume...

20:47.254 --> 20:51.616
The judge and my husband.
But why would George do that?

20:52.032 --> 20:57.601
There was no tension between
the judge and my husband, okay?

20:57.601 --> 20:59.464
Now, if you'll excuse me.

21:03.769 --> 21:07.026
Her husband may be trying
to pull her into the gutter,

21:07.026 --> 21:09.155
but Maureen Pagolis went out

21:09.155 --> 21:13.642
and put on her game face today
at the opening of a new community center.

21:13.642 --> 21:16.057
While she's at it,
she should write a book.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.989
"When bad men happen to good women."

21:18.989 --> 21:21.894
NYPD, wake up.
If this man isn't guilty,

21:21.894 --> 21:24.925
well, then Macy's
doesn't sell pantyhose.

21:24.925 --> 21:25.969
I don't understand.

21:25.969 --> 21:29.878
This guy just shows up and says
he was approached to kill the judge?

21:29.878 --> 21:33.150
Goren's in with him.
Guy's on parole for gun possession.

21:33.150 --> 21:35.401
So he wanted to get out
in front of this.

21:35.401 --> 21:36.796
Smart move.

21:37.707 --> 21:40.061
- Special forces?
- No.

21:40.061 --> 21:44.281
Okay, black OPs?
Commercial assassin?

21:44.281 --> 21:46.171
I told you "no" already.

21:46.171 --> 21:50.183
And yet you were approached to shoot
a target at a distance of a mile and half

21:50.183 --> 21:53.470
from the rooftop of
a building 60 stories.

21:53.470 --> 21:55.769
We didn't get that far.

21:55.769 --> 21:57.698
I was just asked,

21:57.698 --> 22:01.672
did I have an interest
in taking care of a judge?

22:01.917 --> 22:04.755
You remember who asked you?

22:04.755 --> 22:07.729
Black man in a black suit
handed me an envelope

22:07.729 --> 22:10.018
with a typed "job offer".

22:10.018 --> 22:14.013
And this guy got your name
from the phone book.

22:14.013 --> 22:15.719
I don't know.

22:15.719 --> 22:19.687
I got a record, I admit,
but I've never killed anybody.

22:19.687 --> 22:22.097
So you told him you weren't interested.

22:22.097 --> 22:23.318
Kill a judge?

22:23.318 --> 22:27.092
I might be reckless.
I'm not stupid.

22:27.092 --> 22:30.393
This man in the suit,
the one who approached you,

22:30.393 --> 22:32.046
you remember anything about him?

22:32.046 --> 22:33.495
I never met him before.

22:33.495 --> 22:38.157
He drove a nice car, though.
A Mercedes.

22:38.157 --> 22:42.140
Had a neat bronze medallion
mounted on the back.

22:42.140 --> 22:43.668
How neat?

22:43.668 --> 22:47.653
New York state assembly.

22:53.341 --> 22:56.025
We know you've been driving
the Pagolises for years.

22:56.025 --> 22:58.548
Ever make any deliveries for them?

22:58.548 --> 23:00.641
I drop off a lot of stuff
for Mr. Pagolis.

23:00.641 --> 23:01.765
He gives me an envelope.

23:01.765 --> 23:03.333
I take it where he tells
me to take it.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.668
Sometimes I wait for an answer.

23:05.668 --> 23:09.635
We've looked into your background.
We know you're not in the service.

23:10.702 --> 23:12.340
But you've got a half-brother.

23:12.340 --> 23:16.705
He was in the special forces.
I bet he'd know some super snipers.

23:17.150 --> 23:20.075
I just drop off packages
and drive the car.

23:20.075 --> 23:23.211
The "see no evil, hear no evil"
isn't gonna cut it, Dave.

23:23.211 --> 23:27.797
You don't cooperate, you're look
at conspiracy to commit murder.

23:28.795 --> 23:31.712
Your friend, George Pagolis.

23:33.603 --> 23:38.199
How come everybody ends up taking
a bullet that was meant for him?

23:41.920 --> 23:44.030
Last chance.

23:45.047 --> 23:46.844
I handed envelopes to 3 guys.

23:46.844 --> 23:48.516
Two of them sent the envelopes back.

23:48.516 --> 23:50.478
The third, I made a return trip.

23:50.478 --> 23:52.648
This time with a thick, heavy envelope.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.813
Address?

23:54.813 --> 23:57.997
130 Jerome avenue, 3A.

23:57.997 --> 23:59.792
I better go.

24:14.832 --> 24:17.147
He's been garroted with...

24:17.771 --> 24:20.175
some type of wire.

24:20.958 --> 24:22.901
And he is out of rigor.

24:22.901 --> 24:25.744
No sign of the murder weapon.

24:25.946 --> 24:27.305
Start a canvass.

24:27.305 --> 24:30.807
See if anybody saw or heard anything.

24:32.145 --> 24:35.664
Looks like our sniper's name
is Steve Gilteri.

24:37.113 --> 24:40.910
- He likes mysteries.
- Now he gets to be in one.

25:11.824 --> 25:13.771
You find something?

25:13.771 --> 25:15.478
These plants...

25:15.478 --> 25:19.590
Soil's moist on a radiator cover?

25:38.423 --> 25:39.805
Ballistics match.

25:39.805 --> 25:43.491
The bullet that killed judge Layton
was fired from the sniper's Cheytech.

25:43.491 --> 25:44.625
No prints on it.

25:44.625 --> 25:46.223
- He was a pro.
- Seems like it.

25:46.223 --> 25:50.648
CSU found 20 grand cash
inside his computer printer.

25:50.648 --> 25:51.575
And let me guess.

25:51.575 --> 25:55.371
His no-name cell phone only had calls
logged on it to other no-name cell phones.

25:55.371 --> 25:57.119
No, the killer must've taken it.

25:57.119 --> 25:58.693
But the phone in his apartment,

25:58.693 --> 26:03.372
the LUDs showed two calls to
George Pagolis early yesterday morning.

26:03.372 --> 26:04.960
Anything else link him to Pagolis?

26:04.960 --> 26:07.985
The money we recovered had traces
of blue carpenter's chalk.

26:07.985 --> 26:11.227
We've seen the same chalk
on Pagolis' fingers.

26:11.227 --> 26:13.336
When, when is he coming in
for questions?

26:13.336 --> 26:15.093
We're working that out.

26:15.093 --> 26:18.074
They're bringing
Mrs. Pagolis up here now.

26:18.074 --> 26:20.211
I understand your theory.

26:20.211 --> 26:24.520
I just still don't believe that my husband
could be involved with this.

26:25.150 --> 26:26.650
That was the district attorney.

26:26.650 --> 26:28.897
Evidently, you had already
spoken with him.

26:28.897 --> 26:31.212
Yes, I sought his advice.

26:31.212 --> 26:36.963
He's worried any action we take might
appear to be politically motivated.

26:39.210 --> 26:43.123
Mr. Pagolis will be processed quietly.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.709
No press, no cameras,
no holding cell.

26:45.709 --> 26:47.164
Thank you.

26:47.164 --> 26:48.781
I appreciate that.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.588
I'll coordinate our arrival
time with your detectives.

26:51.588 --> 26:53.298
There's no reason
for you to be with him.

26:53.298 --> 26:54.972
His lawyer can walk him through it.

26:54.972 --> 26:56.567
No, I need to be there.

26:56.567 --> 26:58.431
Why?

26:58.663 --> 27:01.120
'cause he's my husband.

27:01.613 --> 27:03.223
Thank you.

27:06.293 --> 27:07.918
Hey, look, there they are.

27:12.542 --> 27:15.243
Those sons of bitches.

27:17.998 --> 27:20.590
They gave me their word.
We'll go around back.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.207
No, we're getting out here.

27:23.207 --> 27:25.945
In front of these bastards?
Please, go.

27:25.945 --> 27:29.722
We're fine, Dave-O.
Maureen, I invited these people.

27:29.722 --> 27:30.988
You what?

27:30.988 --> 27:32.375
Are you out of your mind?

27:32.375 --> 27:34.312
No, I don't go through back doors.

27:34.312 --> 27:35.960
I want the handcuffs.

27:35.960 --> 27:39.594
If I'm the perp,
I want the perp walk.

27:47.050 --> 27:48.462
Come on, honey.

27:49.783 --> 27:51.548
It's showtime.

27:58.426 --> 28:01.226
Don't you remember?
Stand by your man, huh?

28:05.899 --> 28:08.531
See? Isn't this more fun?

28:17.960 --> 28:20.325
Can you empty your pockets, sir?

28:24.763 --> 28:25.809
What's this?

28:25.809 --> 28:27.708
It's a chalk snap line.

28:27.708 --> 28:30.006
Use it to make a straight line.

28:30.006 --> 28:31.537
It's not gonna set
a metal detector off.

28:31.537 --> 28:33.961
It's plastic and string and chalk.

28:33.961 --> 28:36.016
Hit it again?

28:36.016 --> 28:37.501
- May I?
- What the hell?

28:37.501 --> 28:40.271
Detective, this is harassment.

28:42.961 --> 28:46.986
This is heavy gauge piano wire.

28:48.899 --> 28:51.451
That's not something
you get at Home Depot.

28:51.451 --> 28:53.013
It's a good thing you found that.

28:53.013 --> 28:55.426
That could kill somebody.

28:58.992 --> 29:03.107
I didn't hire the sniper.
I didn't kill the sniper.

29:03.107 --> 29:05.623
Killing is not my thing.

29:05.623 --> 29:08.029
What is your thing, Mr. Pagolis?

29:08.029 --> 29:11.829
Well, French food,
Nordic women, German cars.

29:11.829 --> 29:13.888
State of the art guns.

29:13.888 --> 29:21.139
007 chalk snap lines
with high-gauge garrote wire.

29:21.929 --> 29:27.033
The blood and skin samples
on your chalk line match the sniper's.

29:27.448 --> 29:30.421
How did it end up in your pocket?

29:32.314 --> 29:35.804
I'm in construction.
I usually carry a chalk line with me.

29:35.804 --> 29:39.649
Obviously, somebody planted
this one on me instead of mine.

29:40.148 --> 29:42.581
- Somebody...
- Somebody at work.

29:42.581 --> 29:43.779
The coat check girl at the club.

29:43.779 --> 29:46.674
I don't know, whoever wanted
to frame me for this.

29:46.674 --> 29:48.490
I don't know your dead guy from Adam.

29:48.490 --> 29:51.078
Then how come he called you
the morning he was killed?

29:51.078 --> 29:53.114
I never spoke to him.

29:53.306 --> 29:55.377
If you don't believe me,

29:55.377 --> 29:57.856
why don't you check out the tapes?

30:00.458 --> 30:02.516
I'm sorry. Tapes?

30:02.516 --> 30:03.867
The tapes.

30:03.867 --> 30:08.311
My wife's got my whole life bugged.
You don't know this?

30:08.311 --> 30:10.059
I don't even know when it started.

30:10.059 --> 30:13.530
She's got my office bugged.
The house, the car.

30:13.530 --> 30:16.637
She's probably listening in
on us right now.

30:16.894 --> 30:21.123
I mean, the point is,
if I has spoken to the sniper,

30:21.123 --> 30:23.080
it would be on the tapes.

30:23.080 --> 30:27.822
So why don't you listen to them,
get back to me, hmm?

30:32.437 --> 30:34.423
Can you give us a minute?

30:36.819 --> 30:38.440
She can wire their home,

30:38.440 --> 30:41.536
but if she taped anywhere else,
she broke the law.

30:41.536 --> 30:45.283
Which means she probably
won't own up to having them.

30:45.283 --> 30:49.336
Well, tell her if she doesn't,
then we'll subpoena them,

30:49.336 --> 30:51.548
and we'll leak it to the press.

30:51.548 --> 30:53.907
So Pagolis kills a judge
out of jealousy,

30:53.907 --> 30:56.758
and we persecute her for taping him?

30:56.758 --> 30:58.831
Something like that.

30:59.061 --> 31:01.316
I'll speak to Mrs. Pagolis
about those tapes.

31:01.316 --> 31:05.125
In the meantime, we have
more than enough to hold him.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.495
Maybe a little too much.

31:07.495 --> 31:10.941
Using his own phone to make a hit.

31:10.941 --> 31:14.819
The murder weapon in his coat.

31:15.507 --> 31:19.606
It's tapes...
which we won't have until morning.

31:22.517 --> 31:24.367
Maisy. She was on coat check
Wednesday night.

31:24.367 --> 31:26.665
She should be in soon, um...

31:26.665 --> 31:27.994
While you're waiting,
can I get you folks something?

31:27.994 --> 31:29.741
I'll have a Glenlivet.

31:29.741 --> 31:31.293
Eames.

31:33.439 --> 31:35.990
- Okay, got it.
- Just one second.

31:35.990 --> 31:39.681
Uh, vodka martini double,
easy on the vermouth.

31:39.681 --> 31:40.971
Yes, ma'am.

31:42.478 --> 31:44.603
That was the captain.

31:45.608 --> 31:48.921
He threatened to go public,
and she caved on the tapes.

31:48.921 --> 31:51.059
You happy now?

31:52.658 --> 31:55.090
I want Pagolis to go down,
but not if he didn't do it.

31:55.090 --> 31:56.683
Either way, she'll go down now.

31:56.683 --> 31:58.982
You know this'll leak out.

31:58.982 --> 32:00.379
Her career's ruined.

32:00.379 --> 32:01.915
Well, then she shouldn't
have bugged him.

32:01.915 --> 32:04.113
She should've left him.

32:06.381 --> 32:08.396
Are we all right?

32:12.288 --> 32:14.562
I hope so.

32:14.979 --> 32:16.417
Here we go.

32:17.115 --> 32:18.702
Thank you.

32:20.330 --> 32:23.201
I think those tapes
are gonna clear Pagolis.

32:23.201 --> 32:25.760
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have brought it up.

32:26.815 --> 32:29.503
He knows who did this,
and it wasn't him.

32:29.503 --> 32:32.291
He checks the girl's.
Or, I mean, whoever he came in with.

32:32.291 --> 32:35.207
The man has to wear
an overcoat sometime.

32:35.207 --> 32:36.661
I asked him about it once.

32:36.661 --> 32:38.436
He said that's why he has a car,

32:38.436 --> 32:41.241
so he has a safe place
to leave his coat.

32:43.811 --> 32:48.455
All right, so Dave-O watches his coat,
and George wanted us to know that.

32:48.455 --> 32:49.779
Good night.

32:50.437 --> 32:54.122
So we're clear.
20 now and 20 afterwards.

32:54.122 --> 32:55.847
They're gonna be standing
there just like that?

32:55.847 --> 32:59.416
Yes, so you don't worry about
who's where.

32:59.416 --> 33:01.695
Just get the guy in gray.

33:01.695 --> 33:03.597
Come on, Dave-O,
Chop-chop. We gotta go.

33:03.597 --> 33:05.427
Yes, sir, Mr. Pagolis.

33:05.679 --> 33:07.191
Gotta go.

33:14.186 --> 33:16.121
Don't know him. Sorry.

33:16.121 --> 33:18.503
Steve Gilteri.

33:18.503 --> 33:22.698
He was in the special forces
with your half-brother.

33:22.698 --> 33:25.137
Well, maybe I met him some time.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.361
What the hell happened to him?

33:27.972 --> 33:31.123
We've got it all on tape.

33:32.252 --> 33:35.132
- Come again?
- Mrs. P bugged your boss.

33:35.132 --> 33:39.639
Every conversation you've had in the car
was handed over to us this morning.

33:39.639 --> 33:42.193
That pen of yours has a bug in it, too.

33:42.193 --> 33:44.429
But Mr. Pagolis gave me that pen.

33:44.429 --> 33:48.538
Yeah, once he found out
that she was taping him,

33:48.538 --> 33:51.732
he passed the bugs around.

33:51.732 --> 33:54.047
You know, for fun.

33:54.047 --> 33:56.016
We already know you called the sniper,

33:56.016 --> 34:00.089
and that he had the rifle
from a warehouse theft.

34:00.089 --> 34:02.290
And that's just the first
couple of tapes.

34:02.290 --> 34:06.265
You caught a tough break
when the judge was killed.

34:06.717 --> 34:11.819
I guess you decided to
frame Pagolis for the murders.

34:11.819 --> 34:15.773
That would be your way
of getting rid of him.

34:21.413 --> 34:23.349
You got me.

34:23.349 --> 34:25.224
I did it.

34:27.266 --> 34:30.521
I hired Steve.
He shot the judge.

34:30.521 --> 34:32.899
And then I killed him.

34:32.899 --> 34:35.630
Want me to sign something?

34:37.033 --> 34:39.385
Uh, yeah.

34:40.900 --> 34:44.750
Uh, why did you do it?

34:45.751 --> 34:48.514
I like Mrs. Pagolis.

34:48.514 --> 34:50.900
I want her to have a chance.

34:50.900 --> 34:55.878
I wanted that cheating, lying,
scumbag of a husband out of her life

34:55.878 --> 34:58.575
so she could be free.

34:58.575 --> 35:02.299
I don't know what he had on her,
but who was just like my mother.

35:02.299 --> 35:05.423
She was never gonna get away.

35:08.288 --> 35:11.784
Yeah, I guess, uh, it was like
a rescue operation?

35:11.784 --> 35:15.097
It was a rescue operation.

35:15.097 --> 35:18.252
Did Maureen know about your plan?

35:18.496 --> 35:20.080
No, ma'am.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.702
She'd have tried to stop me.

35:24.510 --> 35:26.901
He wanted her to fail.

35:26.901 --> 35:29.714
Every chance he had,

35:29.714 --> 35:33.721
he pulled some stunt to get
her smeared in the press.

35:35.119 --> 35:38.052
You really got his whole life on tape?

35:40.583 --> 35:42.702
That's good.

35:42.702 --> 35:45.464
He's gotta go down for something.

35:52.548 --> 35:55.184
This guy, he's,
he's got his own code.

35:55.184 --> 35:56.857
Okay, that's a confession.

35:56.857 --> 35:58.986
Now his fate is up to a judge.

35:58.986 --> 36:01.163
And Maureen?
What's the DA's verdict?

36:01.163 --> 36:03.841
She'll be charged
with illegal wire tapping,

36:03.841 --> 36:05.913
and unless we find
something on the tapes,

36:05.913 --> 36:07.315
her husband skates.

36:07.315 --> 36:09.140
Why am I not surprised?

36:09.140 --> 36:11.220
Eames, if Dave-O's still
protecting her,

36:11.220 --> 36:14.047
we can't assume Maureen
wasn't involved.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.845
You should go to her.

36:15.845 --> 36:19.534
See if she can fill in
any gaps about Dave-O.

36:29.207 --> 36:30.870
Please come in.

36:30.870 --> 36:32.233
Would you like coffee?

36:32.233 --> 36:35.421
Oh, uh, no, thank you.

36:36.821 --> 36:40.712
My husband called
to tell me about Dave-O.

36:40.909 --> 36:45.998
He couldn't wait to tell me that my loyal
driver had killed my best friend.

36:45.998 --> 36:50.353
The tapes. You knew
they were against the law.

36:50.353 --> 36:51.575
I don't understand...

36:51.575 --> 36:55.317
The judge told me not to do it.
He said it would be trouble.

36:55.317 --> 36:58.367
But I had to know.

36:58.367 --> 36:59.979
Didn't you know already?

36:59.979 --> 37:02.268
I needed proof.

37:03.105 --> 37:05.299
And even when I had it,

37:05.299 --> 37:08.202
he could lie to me
and I'd still believe him.

37:08.202 --> 37:10.962
That's why you kept on taping.

37:10.962 --> 37:13.037
You never stopped listening.

37:13.037 --> 37:16.198
For a while, yes, I did.

37:16.687 --> 37:20.268
Until he started the new affair.

37:20.623 --> 37:24.206
I could tell when I went to the club
and the maitre d' would pretend

37:24.206 --> 37:28.375
he hadn't seen George
there the night before.

37:28.375 --> 37:30.550
And you started listening again.

37:30.550 --> 37:34.467
I thought that maybe
I could divorce him now.

37:36.264 --> 37:40.427
Maybe the boys were
old enough to understand.

37:41.101 --> 37:45.036
It was awful listening to the tapes.

37:45.036 --> 37:48.855
I think that he told her things...

37:48.855 --> 37:51.634
just to hurt me...

37:51.634 --> 37:55.002
'cause he knew that I was listening.

37:56.142 --> 37:58.966
We weren't like this in the beginning.

37:59.788 --> 38:03.858
We had parties.
We had friends.

38:06.142 --> 38:08.392
So that was...

38:08.392 --> 38:11.169
is that all that you heard?

38:11.898 --> 38:14.531
About the affair?

38:14.531 --> 38:16.647
I'm sorry.

38:19.046 --> 38:22.316
That pen.
I gave that to my husband.

38:22.316 --> 38:24.359
And he gave it to Dave-O.

38:24.359 --> 38:28.860
Who had it with him all the time.

38:29.811 --> 38:31.334
Even while hiring the sniper,

38:31.334 --> 38:35.370
while watching the rehearsal
with the sniper.

38:35.370 --> 38:41.965
While telling the sniper
to kill the guy in gray.

38:44.703 --> 38:47.650
Now, you heard him, didn't you?

38:47.650 --> 38:52.868
You heard Dave-O arranging
to kill your husband, didn't you?

38:56.897 --> 38:59.200
Yes.

38:59.200 --> 39:03.456
On the tapes.
I heard that.

39:04.943 --> 39:08.593
- What did you do?
- I didn't know what to do.

39:11.282 --> 39:13.026
I thought of canceling the duel.

39:13.026 --> 39:15.374
Telling my husband,
telling the judge,

39:15.374 --> 39:18.416
confronting Dave-O,
telling the police.

39:18.416 --> 39:21.467
But you didn't do any of those things.

39:22.103 --> 39:26.052
No. I just...

39:26.052 --> 39:32.358
decided to let the father
of my children, this horrible man...

39:32.891 --> 39:35.299
just die.

39:36.849 --> 39:39.605
I didn't know about them
changing rules

39:39.605 --> 39:41.466
until they came out for the duel.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.175
Why didn't you do anything?

39:43.175 --> 39:44.916
I didn't know what to do!

39:44.916 --> 39:47.376
I couldn't think!

39:49.141 --> 39:51.820
If I rushed out there
and stopped the duel,

39:51.820 --> 39:56.501
I would have to say that there was
a plot to kill my husband.

40:00.315 --> 40:03.124
I couldn't move.

40:04.225 --> 40:07.034
Could not move.

40:08.933 --> 40:15.805
I was so busy trying to think of
some way not to implicate myself.

40:17.270 --> 40:22.060
And all I kept thinking about was...

40:22.060 --> 40:25.778
"he could miss. Please, God."

40:25.778 --> 40:29.220
"No one could make a shot like that."

40:32.644 --> 40:35.633
And then the pistols fired

40:36.783 --> 40:40.634
and the judge fell forward.

40:40.634 --> 40:43.623
And it was done.

40:44.800 --> 40:48.544
And I think that I screamed but I...

40:49.284 --> 40:52.558
and I am so sorry.

41:02.346 --> 41:06.637
I'll go with you
while you get dressed.

41:10.756 --> 41:13.486
It's fine.
I'm okay.
