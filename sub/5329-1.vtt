[quote on screen]

00:50.697 --> 00:57.954
A cofounder of the social,
news and entertainment website
Reddit has been found dead.

00:58.494 --> 01:02.096
He certainly was a prodigy, although
he never thought of himself like that.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.920
He was totally unexcited

01:04.920 --> 01:08.444
about starting businesses and making money.

01:09.904 --> 01:14.879
There's a profound sense of loss tonight
in Highland Park, Aaron Swartz's hometown,

01:14.879 --> 01:18.391
as loved ones say goodbye to
one of the Internet's brightest lights.

01:18.471 --> 01:21.841
Freedom, open access, and computer
activists are mourning his loss.

01:21.841 --> 01:25.069
"An astonishing intellect",
if you talk to people who knew him.

01:25.069 --> 01:29.726
He was killed by the government, and
MIT betrayed all of its basic principles.

01:29.726 --> 01:32.976
They wanted to make an
example out of him, okay?

01:35.176 --> 01:39.053
Governments have an insatiable
desire to control.

01:39.053 --> 01:43.477
He was potentially facing 35 years
in prison and a one million dollar fine.

01:43.477 --> 01:50.019
Raising questions of prosecutorial zeal,
and I would say even misconduct.

01:50.019 --> 01:55.437
Have you looked into that particular matter
and reached any conclusions?

01:57.399 --> 02:01.695
Growing up, I slowly had this process of
realizing that all the things around me that

02:01.695 --> 02:06.433
people had told me were just the natural way
things were, the way things always would be,

02:06.433 --> 02:08.720
they weren't natural at all,
there were things that could be changed

02:08.720 --> 02:11.824
and there were things that more
importantly were wrong and should change,

02:11.824 --> 02:14.364
and once I realized that,
there was really no going back.

02:24.274 --> 02:28.061
Welcome to story reading time.

02:28.061 --> 02:33.053
The name of the book is
"Paddington at the Fair".

02:33.053 --> 02:36.674
Well, he was born in
Highland Park and grew up here.

02:36.674 --> 02:40.038
Aaron came from a family of three
brothers, all extraordinarily bright.

02:40.038 --> 02:44.522
"Oh, the box is tipping over..."

02:44.532 --> 02:48.384
So we were all, you know,
not the best behaved children.

02:48.384 --> 02:51.682
You know, three boys running around
all the time, causing trouble.

02:51.682 --> 02:54.005
"Hey, no, no no!"

02:54.005 --> 02:55.874
- Aaron!
- What?

02:55.874 --> 03:01.134
But I've come to the realization that Aaron
learned how to learn at a very young age.

03:01.161 --> 03:06.441
"One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten!"

03:06.471 --> 03:09.232
- Knock, knock!
- Who's there?

03:09.232 --> 03:11.727
- Aaron.
- Aaron who?

03:11.727 --> 03:12.853
- Aaron Funnyman.

03:12.853 --> 03:15.248
He knew what he wanted,
and he always wanted to do it.

03:15.248 --> 03:17.409
He always accomplished what he wanted.

03:18.459 --> 03:21.508
His curiosity was endless.

03:21.508 --> 03:27.047
"Here's a little picture of what the
planets are. And each planet has a symbol."

03:27.047 --> 03:33.097
"Mercury symbol, Venus symbol,
Earth symbol, Mars symbol, Jupiter symbol."

03:33.097 --> 03:37.089
One day he said to Susan, "What's this free
family entertainment downtown Highland Park?"

03:37.089 --> 03:40.484
"Free family entertainment
downtown Highland Park."

03:40.484 --> 03:42.501
He was three at the time.

03:42.501 --> 03:44.642
She said, "What are you talking about?"

03:44.642 --> 03:46.412
He said, "Look, it says
here on the refrigerator,"

03:46.412 --> 03:50.092
"Free family entertainment
downtown Highland Park."

03:50.092 --> 03:54.513
She was floored and
astonished that he could read.

03:55.010 --> 03:59.010
It's called "My Family Seder".

03:59.755 --> 04:04.840
The Seder night is different
from all other nights.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.772
I remember once, we were at
the University of Chicago Library.

04:08.847 --> 04:12.318
I pulled a book off the shelf
that was from like 1900,

04:12.318 --> 04:16.149
and showed to him and said, "You know,
this is really just an extraordinary place."

04:16.149 --> 04:22.509
We all were curious children, but Aaron really
liked learning and really liked teaching.

04:22.509 --> 04:27.495
"And we're going to learn the ABC backwards."

04:27.495 --> 04:31.385
"Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T..."

04:31.493 --> 04:35.290
I remember, he came home
from his first Algebra class.

04:35.290 --> 04:38.748
He was like, "Noah, let me teach you algebra!"

04:38.748 --> 04:41.134
And I'm like, "What is algebra?"

04:41.134 --> 04:43.137
And he was always like that.

04:43.137 --> 04:48.618
"Now let's press click button,
there! Now it's got that!"

04:48.618 --> 04:51.858
"Now it's in pink!"

04:51.858 --> 04:56.098
When he was about two or three years old,
and Bob introduced him to computers,

04:56.098 --> 04:59.600
then he just took off like crazy on them.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.507
(baby talk)

05:03.507 --> 05:09.237
We all had computers, but Aaron really
took to them, really took to the Internet.

05:09.237 --> 05:12.965
- Working at the computer?
- Nah...

05:12.965 --> 05:16.038
"How come...Mommy, why is nothing working?"

05:16.038 --> 05:18.297
He started programming
from a really young age.

05:18.297 --> 05:21.506
I remember the first program
that I wrote with him was in BASIC,

05:21.506 --> 05:24.385
and it was a Star Wars trivia game.

05:25.875 --> 05:30.186
He sat down with me in the basement,
where the computer was,

05:30.186 --> 05:33.047
for hours, programming this game.

05:34.817 --> 05:38.511
The problem that I kept having with him is
that there was nothing that I wanted done,

05:38.511 --> 05:41.553
and to him, there was always something to do,

05:41.553 --> 05:44.375
always something that programming could solve.

05:47.085 --> 05:50.511
The way Aaron always saw it,
is that programming is magic.

05:50.511 --> 05:54.042
You can accomplish these things
that normal humans can't.

05:54.042 --> 05:58.365
Aaron made an ATM using like
a Macintosh and like a cardboard box.

05:58.365 --> 06:01.838
One year for Halloween,
I didn't know what I wanted to be,

06:01.838 --> 06:06.358
and he thought it would be really, really cool
if I dressed up like his new favorite computer,

06:06.358 --> 06:09.108
which at the time was the original iMac.

06:09.108 --> 06:12.824
I mean, he hated dressing up for Halloween
but he loved convincing other people

06:12.824 --> 06:16.070
to dress up as things that he wanted to see.

06:16.070 --> 06:20.395
"Host Aaron, stop!
Guys, come on, look at the camera!"

06:20.395 --> 06:22.720
"Spiderman looks at the camera!"

06:24.010 --> 06:31.365
He made this website called The Info,
where people can just fill in information.

06:31.365 --> 06:34.987
I'm sure someone out there knows
all about gold, gold leafing...

06:34.987 --> 06:37.000
Why they don't write about
that on this website?

06:37.100 --> 06:38.722
And then other people
can come at a later point,

06:38.722 --> 06:43.347
and read that information, and edit
the information if they thought it was bad.

06:43.347 --> 06:46.226
Not too dissimilar from Wikipedia, right?

06:46.226 --> 06:51.584
And this was before Wikipedia had begun,
and this was developed by a 12-year-old,

06:51.584 --> 06:58.452
in his room, by himself, running on this
tiny server using ancient technology.

06:58.452 --> 07:01.282
And one of the teachers responds,

07:01.282 --> 07:07.282
"This is a terrible idea, you can't just
let anyone author the encyclopedia!"

07:07.282 --> 07:10.142
"The whole reason we have scholars
is to write these books for us."

07:10.142 --> 07:12.674
"How could you ever have
such a terrible idea?"

07:12.674 --> 07:16.701
Me and my other brother would be like,
"Oh, you know, yeah Wikipedia is cool, but..."

07:16.701 --> 07:20.408
"we had that in our house,
like, five years ago."

07:21.288 --> 07:25.597
Aaron's website, theinfo.org,
wins a school competition

07:25.597 --> 07:30.348
hosted by the Cambridge-based
web design firm ArsDigita.

07:33.688 --> 07:38.090
We all went to Cambridge
when he won the ArsDigita prize

07:38.090 --> 07:40.056
and we had no clue what Aaron was doing.

07:40.056 --> 07:43.358
It was obvious that the
prize was really important.

07:44.118 --> 07:47.961
Aaron soon became involved with
online programming communities,

07:47.961 --> 07:51.437
then in the process of shaping
a new tool for the Web.

07:51.437 --> 07:55.545
He comes up to me and is like, "Ben, there's
this really awesome thing that I'm working on."

07:55.545 --> 07:57.713
"You need to hear about it!"

07:57.713 --> 07:59.742
"Yeah, what is it?"

07:59.742 --> 08:01.769
"It's this thing called RSS."

08:02.689 --> 08:07.521
And he explains to me what RSS is.
I'm like, "Why is that useful, Aaron?"

08:07.521 --> 08:11.268
"Is any site using it?
Why would I want to use it?"

08:11.268 --> 08:16.633
There was this mailing list for people who
are working on RSS, and XML more generally,

08:16.633 --> 08:21.254
and there was a person on it named Aaron
Swartz who was combative but very smart,

08:21.254 --> 08:24.765
and who had lots of good ideas, and

08:24.765 --> 08:28.636
he didn't ever come to the
face-to-face meetings, and they said,

08:28.636 --> 08:31.922
"You know, when are you gonna come out
to one of these face-to-face meetings?"

08:31.922 --> 08:37.222
And he said, "You know, I don't think my
mom would let me. I've just turned fourteen."

08:37.222 --> 08:42.674
And so their first reaction was:
"Well, this person, this colleague
we've been working with all year

08:42.674 --> 08:46.694
was thirteen years old while we were
working with him, and he's only fourteen now."

08:46.694 --> 08:48.007
And their second reaction was:

08:48.007 --> 08:51.290
"Christ, we really want to meet him.
That's extraordinary!"

08:51.290 --> 08:53.685
He was part of the committee
that drafted RSS.

08:53.685 --> 08:59.151
What he was doing was to help build
the plumbing for modern hypertext.

08:59.151 --> 09:05.856
The piece that he was working on, RSS,
was a tool that you can use to get summaries

09:05.856 --> 09:08.675
of things that are going on
on other web pages.

09:08.675 --> 09:10.613
Most commonly, you would use this for a blog.

09:10.613 --> 09:13.511
You might have 10 or 20
people's blogs you wanna read.

09:13.511 --> 09:18.318
You use their RSS feeds, these summaries
of what's going on on those other pages

09:18.318 --> 09:22.609
to create a unified list of
all the stuff that's going on.

09:22.609 --> 09:27.618
Aaron was really young, but he understood the
technology and he saw that it was imperfect

09:27.618 --> 09:30.418
and looked for ways to help make it better.

09:35.645 --> 09:39.965
So his mom started bundling him on planes in
Chicago. We'd pick him up in San Francisco.

09:39.965 --> 09:43.500
We'd introduce him to interesting
people to argue with, and we'd marvel

09:43.600 --> 09:45.300
at his horrific eating habits.

09:45.350 --> 09:50.100
He only ate white food, only like steamed
rice and not fried rice 'cause that wasn't

09:50.150 --> 09:53.700
sufficiently white and
white bread, and so on...

09:53.700 --> 09:59.250
and you kind of marveled at the
quality of the debate emerging from this,

09:59.263 --> 10:01.744
what appeared to be a small boy's mouth,

10:01.744 --> 10:05.063
and you'd think, this is a kid
that's really going to get somewhere
if he doesn't die of scurvy.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.693
Aaron, you're up!

10:06.693 --> 10:10.002
I think the difference is that now
you can't make companies like dotcoms.

10:10.002 --> 10:15.720
You can't have companies that just sell
dog food over the Internet,
or sell dog food over cell phones.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.186
But there's still a lot of innovation going on.

10:18.186 --> 10:21.425
I think that maybe if you don't see the
innovation, maybe your head is in the sand.

10:21.425 --> 10:25.300
He takes on this, like an alpha nerd
personality, where he's sort of like,

10:25.350 --> 10:28.612
"I'm smarter than you, and because
I'm smarter than you, I'm better than you,

10:28.612 --> 10:30.500
and I can tell you what to do."

10:30.550 --> 10:35.202
It's an extension of, like,
him being kind of like a twerp.

10:35.310 --> 10:39.010
So you aggregate all these computers
together and now they're solving big problems

10:39.010 --> 10:42.040
like searching for aliens
and trying to cure cancer.

10:45.110 --> 10:48.470
I first met him on IRC,
on Internet Relay Chat.

10:48.470 --> 10:53.490
He didn't just write code, he also got
people excited about solving problems he got.

10:53.490 --> 10:55.617
He was a connector.

10:55.617 --> 10:58.417
The free culture movement
has had a lot of his energy.

10:58.751 --> 11:03.872
I think Aaron was trying to make the
world work. He was trying to fix it.

11:03.872 --> 11:08.640
He had a very kind of strong personality
that definitely ruffled feathers at times.

11:08.640 --> 11:13.395
It wasn't necesarily the case that
he was always comfortable in the world

11:13.395 --> 11:16.265
and the world wasn't
always comfortable with him.

11:18.994 --> 11:22.994
Aaron got into high school and
was really just sick of school.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
He didn't like it. He didn't like any
of the classes that were being taught.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.939
He didn't like the teachers.

11:27.939 --> 11:30.496
Aaron really knew how to get information.

11:30.496 --> 11:34.819
He was like, "I don't need to go to
this teacher to learn how to do geometry.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.012
I can just read the geometry book,

11:37.032 --> 11:41.178
and I don't need to go to this teacher to
learn their version of American history,

11:41.178 --> 11:45.400
I have, like, three historical
compilations here, I could just read them,

11:45.400 --> 11:49.091
and I'm not interested in that.
I'm interested in the Web."

11:49.091 --> 11:53.368
I was very frustrated with school.
I thought the teachers didn't know
what they were talking about,

11:53.368 --> 11:57.021
and they were domineering and controlling,
and the homework was kind of a sham,

11:57.021 --> 12:01.103
and it was all just like all about
a way to pen students all together
and force them to do busywork.

12:01.103 --> 12:05.305
And, you know, I started reading
books about the history of education

12:05.305 --> 12:07.847
and how this educational system was developed

12:07.847 --> 12:11.221
and, you know, alternatives to it and
ways that people could actually learn things

12:11.221 --> 12:15.021
as opposed to just regurgitating
facts that teachers told them,

12:15.240 --> 12:19.428
and that kind of led me down
this path of questioning things,
once I questioned the school I was in,

12:19.428 --> 12:24.361
I questioned the society that built the
school, I questioned the businesses that
the schools were training people for,

12:24.361 --> 12:28.089
I questioned the government that
set up this whole structure.

12:28.089 --> 12:32.022
One of the thing he was most passionate about
was copyright, especially in those early days.

12:32.192 --> 12:37.600
Copyright has always been something
of a burden on the publishing industry
and on readers,

12:38.120 --> 12:43.460
but it wasn't an excessive burden. It was
a reasonable institution to have in place

12:44.477 --> 12:46.913
to make sure that people got paid.

12:47.045 --> 12:53.083
What Aaron's generation experienced
was the collision between
this antique copyright system

12:53.083 --> 12:57.120
and this amazing new thing we were
trying to build--the Internet and the Web.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.260
These things collided,
and what we got was chaos.

13:02.454 --> 13:06.061
He then met Harvard Law
Professor Lawrence Lessig,

13:06.061 --> 13:09.328
who was then challenging
copyright law in the Supreme Court.

13:09.328 --> 13:13.269
A young Aaron Swartz flew to Washington
to listen to the Supreme Court hearings.

13:13.279 --> 13:17.759
I am Aaron Swartz and I'm here to listen
to the Eldred--to see the Eldred document.

13:17.894 --> 13:23.144
Why did you fly out here from Chicago, and
come all this way to see the Eldred argument?

13:23.493 --> 13:25.743
That's a more difficult question...

13:29.231 --> 13:33.974
I don't know. It's very exciting
to see the Supreme Court,

13:33.974 --> 13:36.704
especially in such a
prestigious case as this one.

13:42.669 --> 13:47.039
Lessig was also moving forward with a
new way to define copyright on the Internet.

13:47.039 --> 13:49.356
It was called Creative Commons.

13:49.356 --> 13:53.560
So the simple idea of Creative Commons
is to give people --creators--

13:53.560 --> 13:58.694
a simple way to mark their creativity
with the freedoms they intended to carry.

13:58.694 --> 14:02.583
So if copyright is all about
"All Rights Reserved",

14:02.700 --> 14:04.583
then this is a kind of a
"Some Rights Reserved" model.

14:04.583 --> 14:08.789
I want a simple way to say to you,
"Here's what you can do with my work,

14:08.979 --> 14:13.715
even if there are other things which you need
to get my permission before you could do."

14:13.715 --> 14:16.501
And Aaron's role was the computer part.

14:16.501 --> 14:20.802
Like, how do you architect the licenses so
they'll be simple and understandable

14:20.802 --> 14:24.127
and expressed in a way so
that machines can process it?

14:24.207 --> 14:29.994
And people were like,
"Why do you have this 15-year-old kid writing
the specifications for Creative Commons?

14:29.994 --> 14:32.159
Don't you think that's a huge mistake?"

14:32.159 --> 14:35.679
And Larry is like, "The biggest mistake we
would have done is not listening to this kid."

14:36.031 --> 14:39.668
He barely is not even tall
enough to even get over the podium,

14:39.711 --> 14:43.100
and it was this movable podium so
it was this embarrassing thing,

14:43.102 --> 14:45.968
where once he put his screen up
nobody could see his face.

14:46.874 --> 14:51.257
When you come to our website here,
and you go to "Choose License".

14:51.257 --> 14:56.957
It gives you this list of options,
it explains what it means,
and you've got three simple questions:

14:57.740 --> 15:00.055
"Do you want to require attribution?"

15:00.225 --> 15:03.287
"Do you want to allow
commercial uses of your work?"

15:03.507 --> 15:06.413
"Do you want to allow
modifications of your work?"

15:06.413 --> 15:12.246
I was floored, just completely flabbergasted
that these adults regarded him as an adult,

15:12.246 --> 15:14.800
and Aaron stood up there in front
of a whole audience full of people,

15:14.850 --> 15:16.428
and just started talking about

15:16.428 --> 15:20.421
the platform that he'd
created for Creative Commons,

15:20.421 --> 15:23.372
and they were all listening to him, just...

15:23.372 --> 15:28.742
I was sitting at the back, thinking: he's
just a kid, why are they listening to him?

15:28.892 --> 15:29.978
But they did...

15:30.168 --> 15:32.784
Well, I don't think I comprehended it fully.

15:32.784 --> 15:37.171
Though critics have said it does little
to ensure artists get paid for their work,

15:37.216 --> 15:40.572
the success of Creative Commons
has been enormous.

15:40.572 --> 15:46.776
Currently on the website Flickr alone,
over 200 million people use some form
of Creative Commons license.

15:46.992 --> 15:56.638
He contributed through his technical
abilities, and yet it was not simply
a technical matter to him.

15:57.651 --> 16:00.551
Aaron often wrote candidly
in his personal blog:

16:01.101 --> 16:05.812
I think deeply about things,
and I want others to do likewise.

16:06.722 --> 16:11.049
I work for ideas and learn from people.
I don't like excluding people.

16:11.429 --> 16:15.556
I'm a perfectionist, but I won't let
that get in the way of publication.

16:15.636 --> 16:19.661
Except for education and entertainment,
I'm not going to waste my time

16:19.661 --> 16:21.654
on things that won't have an impact.

16:21.654 --> 16:26.161
I try to be friends with everyone, but I
hate it when you don't take me seriously.

16:26.161 --> 16:32.086
I don't hold grudges, it's not productive,
but I learn from my experience.

16:32.086 --> 16:35.396
I want to make the world a better place.

16:41.102 --> 16:46.100
In 2004, Swartz leaves Highland Park
and enrolls in Stanford University.

16:46.300 --> 16:50.000
He'd had ulcerative colitis
which was very troubling,

16:50.100 --> 16:51.848
and we were concerned about
him taking his medication.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.863
He got hospitalized and he would take
this cocktail of pills every day,

16:56.753 --> 17:01.093
and one of those pills was
a steroid which stunted his growth,

17:01.093 --> 17:04.781
and made him feel different
from any of the other students.

17:04.781 --> 17:07.828
Aaron, I think, shows up at
Stanford ready to do scholarship

17:07.828 --> 17:12.800
and finds himself in effectively a babysitting
program for overachieving high-schoolers

17:12.800 --> 17:20.828
who in four years are meant to become
captains of industry and one-percenters

17:20.828 --> 17:25.578
and I think it just made him bananas.

17:26.077 --> 17:29.197
In 2005, after only one year of college,

17:29.197 --> 17:35.874
Swartz was offered a spot at a new start-up
incubation firm called Y Combinator,
lead by Paul Graham.

17:36.431 --> 17:39.777
He's like, "Hey, I have
this idea for a a website."

17:39.851 --> 17:43.170
And Paul Graham likes him enough,
and says, "Yeah, sure."

17:43.170 --> 17:46.650
So Aaron drops out of school,
moves to this apartment...

17:46.668 --> 17:49.604
So this used to be Aaron's
apartment when he moved here.

17:49.604 --> 17:55.397
I have vague memories of my father telling
me how difficult it was to get a lease

17:55.397 --> 17:58.737
'cause Aaron had no credit
and he dropped out of college.

17:58.742 --> 18:04.989
Aaron lived in what's now the livingroom
and some of the posters are leftover from
when Aaron lived here.

18:04.989 --> 18:09.889
And then the library...there are more
books, but a lot of them are Aaron's.

18:11.551 --> 18:17.511
Aaron's Y Combinator site was called
"infogami", a tool to build websites.

18:17.511 --> 18:21.098
But infogami struggles to find users,
and Swartz eventually

18:21.098 --> 18:25.037
merges his company with another
Y Combinator project in need of help.

18:25.037 --> 18:29.919
It was a project headed by Steve Huffman
and Alexis Ohanian, called "Reddit".

18:29.919 --> 18:33.988
There we were, starting from almost nothing.
No users, no money, no code,

18:33.988 --> 18:37.657
and growing day by day into
a hugely popular website,

18:37.657 --> 18:39.846
And it showed no signs of letting up.

18:39.846 --> 18:44.373
First we had 1000 users, then 10000,
then 20000 and on, and on...
It was just incredible.

18:44.373 --> 18:49.563
Reddit becomes huge and it's a
real sort of geeky corner of the Internet.

18:52.642 --> 19:01.220
There's a lot of humor, there's a lot of art,
and there's just people who flock to the site,

19:01.220 --> 19:07.883
and make that site the main site they
go to every morning to get their news.

19:07.883 --> 19:12.008
reddit kind of just borders
on chaos at some levels,

19:12.008 --> 19:19.368
so on the one hand it's a place where
people discuss news of the day,
technology, politics and issues,

19:19.368 --> 19:24.824
and yet there is a lot of kind of Not Safe
For Work material, offensive material,

19:24.824 --> 19:29.716
there are some sub-reddits where
trolls find a welcome home,

19:29.716 --> 19:33.929
and so, in that sense reddit has been
kind of home to controversy, as well.

19:33.929 --> 19:36.791
It kind of sits on that edge of chaos.

19:36.791 --> 19:41.081
reddit catches the attention of the
corporate magazine giant Conde Nast,

19:41.081 --> 19:42.938
who makes an offer to buy the company.

19:42.938 --> 19:46.939
Some large amount of money, large enough
that my dad was getting bugged with questions

19:46.939 --> 19:51.079
about like: "How do I store this money?"

19:51.302 --> 19:54.272
- Like a lot of money...
- Like a lot of money.

19:54.272 --> 20:00.319
Like probably more than a million dollars,
but I don't actually know.

20:00.319 --> 20:03.461
- And he's how old at the time?
- 19, 20.

20:05.165 --> 20:11.205
So it was in this apartment. They sat
around on what predated these couches,

20:11.205 --> 20:14.675
hacking on Reddit, and when they sold Reddit

20:14.757 --> 20:18.641
they threw a giant party, and then all
flew out to California the next day,

20:18.641 --> 20:21.885
and left the keys with me.

20:24.261 --> 20:27.480
It was funny, you know, he'd just
sold his start-up so we all presumed

20:27.480 --> 20:29.329
he was the richest person around

20:29.329 --> 20:33.920
but he said, "Oh no, I'll take this tiny
little shoebox-sized room. That's all I need."

20:33.920 --> 20:36.146
It was barely larger than a closet.

20:36.146 --> 20:42.499
The idea of him spending his money on
fancy objects just seemed so implausible.

20:42.580 --> 20:45.590
He explains it as, "I like living in
apartments so I'm not going to spend

20:45.600 --> 20:47.590
a lot of money on a new place to live.
I'm not gonna buy a mansion,

20:47.750 --> 20:49.888
and I like wearing jeans and a T-shirt,

20:50.016 --> 20:52.046
so I'm not going to spend
any more money on clothes.

20:52.046 --> 20:54.576
So it's really no big deal."

20:54.576 --> 20:57.966
What is a big deal to Swartz is how
traffic flows on the internet,

20:58.140 --> 21:00.680
and what commands our attention.

21:00.844 --> 21:04.252
In the old system of broadcasting, you're
fundamentally limited by the amount of

21:04.252 --> 21:08.400
space in the airwaves. You could only
send out ten channels over the airwaves,

21:08.450 --> 21:10.915
television or even with cable,
you had 500 channels.

21:11.003 --> 21:15.593
On the Internet, everybody can have a channel.
Everyone can get a blog, or a MySpace page.

21:15.690 --> 21:18.274
Everyone has a way of expressing themselves.

21:18.274 --> 21:21.280
What you see now is not a question of 
who gets access to the airwaves,

21:21.280 --> 21:25.100
it's a question of who gets control 
over the ways you find people.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.800
You know, you start seeing power
centralizing in sites like Google,

21:27.900 --> 21:29.286
theses sort of gatekeepers that tell you

21:29.286 --> 21:30.993
where on the internet you want to go.

21:30.993 --> 21:34.273
The people who provide you
your sources of news and information.

21:34.273 --> 21:38.314
So it's not only certain people have
a license to speak, now everyone has

21:38.314 --> 21:40.904
a license to speak.
It's a question of who gets heard.

21:45.196 --> 21:49.806
After he started working in San Francisco
at Conde Nast, he comes into the office

21:49.806 --> 21:53.792
and they want to give him a computer
with all this crap installed on it

21:53.792 --> 21:57.273
and say he can't install any
new things on this computer,

21:57.273 --> 21:59.375
which to developers is outrageous.

21:59.375 --> 22:02.095
From the first day, he was complaining
about all the stuff.

22:05.317 --> 22:11.147
"Gray walls, gray desks, gray noise.
The first day I showed up here,
I simply couldn't take it.

22:11.147 --> 22:15.483
By lunchtime, I had literally locked myself
in a bathroom stall and started crying.

22:15.483 --> 22:18.285
I can't imagine staying sane with someone
buzzing in my ear all day

22:18.285 --> 22:21.575
Let alone getting any actual work done.

22:21.575 --> 22:24.087
Nobody else seems to
get work done here either.

22:24.087 --> 22:27.587
Everybody's always coming into our room to
hang out and chat, or invite us to play

22:27.587 --> 22:29.927
the new video game system
that Wired is testing."

22:32.972 --> 22:37.867
He really had different aspirations
that were politically-oriented,

22:37.987 --> 22:41.862
and Silicon Valley just doesn't
really quite have that culture

22:41.862 --> 22:46.967
that orients technical activity
for the purposes of political goals.

22:47.237 --> 22:49.613
Aaron hated working for a corporation.

22:49.613 --> 22:53.673
They all hate working for Conde Nast,
but Aaron is the only one
who is not going to take it.

22:53.694 --> 22:55.884
And Aaron basically gets himself fired.

22:55.903 --> 22:58.313
By not showing up to work, ever.

23:01.183 --> 23:05.434
It was said to be a messy breakup.
Both Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman

23:05.447 --> 23:08.277
declined to be interviewed for this film.

23:09.251 --> 23:15.891
He rejected the business world. One of the
really important things to remember about

23:15.891 --> 23:22.664
that choice when Aaron decided to leave start
up culture is that he was also leaving behind

23:22.664 --> 23:31.334
the things that had made him famous and well-
loved, and he was at risk of letting down fans.

23:31.422 --> 23:35.866
He got to where he was supposed to be
going, and had the self-awareness

23:35.866 --> 23:43.051
and the orneriness to realize that he
had climbed the mountain of shit to pluck

23:43.051 --> 23:45.849
the single rose and discovered
that he'd lost his sense of smell,

23:45.849 --> 23:50.399
and rather than sit there and insist
that it wasn't as bad as it seemed,

23:50.399 --> 23:53.693
and he did get the rose in any event,

23:53.693 --> 23:57.413
he climbed back down again,
which is pretty cool.

23:58.026 --> 24:01.728
The way Aaron always saw it,
is that programming is magic--

24:01.728 --> 24:07.110
you can accomplish these things that normal
humans can't, by being able to program.

24:07.110 --> 24:13.310
So if you had magical powers, 
would you use them for good, 
or to make you mountains of cash?

24:15.009 --> 24:18.478
Swartz was inspired by one of the
visionaries he had met as a child.

24:18.478 --> 24:22.387
The man who had invented the 
World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee.

24:22.387 --> 24:25.938
In the 1990s, Berners-Lee
was arguably sitting on

24:25.938 --> 24:29.260
one of the most lucrative
inventions of the 20th century,

24:29.260 --> 24:35.137
but instead of profiting from the invention of
the World Wide Web, he gave it away for free.

24:36.067 --> 24:39.707
It is the only reason
the World Wide Web exists today.

24:41.118 --> 24:45.261
Aaron is certainly deeply influenced by Tim.

24:45.261 --> 24:50.928
Tim is certainly a very prominent
early Internet genius,
who doesn't in any sense cash out.

24:50.928 --> 24:55.865
He's not at all interested in how he's going
to figure out how to make a billion dollars.

24:55.865 --> 24:57.829
People were saying,
"Ah, there's money to be made there,"

24:57.829 --> 25:00.636
so there would have been lots of little webs,

25:00.636 --> 25:02.139
instead of one big one,

25:02.139 --> 25:05.030
and one little web, and all
sorts of webs doesn't work,

25:05.030 --> 25:08.080
because you can't follow
links from one to the other.

25:10.173 --> 25:14.112
You had to have the critical masses--
the thing was the entire planet,

25:14.112 --> 25:17.172
so it's not going to work unless
the whole planet can get on board.

25:24.141 --> 25:28.372
I feel very strongly that it's not enough
to just live in the world as it is,

25:28.702 --> 25:34.732
to just kind of take what you're given,
and you know, follow the things
that adults told you to do,

25:34.732 --> 25:39.032
and that your parents told you to do,
and that society tells you to do.
I think you should always be questioning.

25:39.045 --> 25:43.145
I take this very scientific attitude, that
everything you've learned is just provisional,

25:43.405 --> 25:49.267
that it's always open to recantation
or refutation or questioning,
and I think the same applies to society.

25:49.267 --> 25:53.491
Once I realized that there were real
serious problems --fundamental problems--

25:53.491 --> 25:58.601
that I could do something to address,
I didn't see a way to forget that.
I didn't see a way not to.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.831
We just started spending a lot of time,

26:04.831 --> 26:06.621
just kind of as friends.

26:08.912 --> 26:11.884
We would just talk, for hours, into the night.

26:14.393 --> 26:18.110
I definitely should have understood that he
was flirting with me. I think to some degree,

26:18.110 --> 26:23.980
I was, like, this is a terrible idea,
and impossible, and therefore
I will pretend it is not happening.

26:25.161 --> 26:28.937
As my marriage was breaking down, and I was
really stuck without anywhere to go,

26:28.937 --> 26:32.927
we became roommates, and
I brought my daughter over.

26:34.081 --> 26:37.246
We moved in, and furnished the house,
and it was really peaceful.

26:37.246 --> 26:40.816
My life had not been peaceful for a while,
and really neither had his.

26:46.225 --> 26:54.073
We were extremely close from
the beginning of our romantic relationship.

26:54.073 --> 26:57.633
We just...we were in constant contact.

26:57.633 --> 27:02.432
But we're both really
difficult people to deal with.

27:04.495 --> 27:10.865
In a very Ally McBeal discussion,
he confessed he had a theme song,
and I made him play it for me.

27:12.345 --> 27:16.504
It was "Extraordinary Machine" by Fiona Apple.

27:16.504 --> 27:24.154
I think it was just that sense of kind of
being a little bit embattled that the song has,

27:25.054 --> 27:27.697
and it also had, like, this hopefulness to it.

27:27.837 --> 27:34.418
# By foot it's a slow climb, but I'm good
at being uncomfortable so I can't stop

27:34.418 --> 27:36.689
changing all the time #

27:36.689 --> 27:41.689
In many ways Aaron was 
tremendously optimistic about life.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.481
Even when he didn't feel it,

27:44.481 --> 27:47.041
he could be tremendously optimistic about life.

27:47.041 --> 27:49.561
# Extraordinary machine #

27:53.237 --> 27:58.317
- What are you doing?
- Flicker has video now.

27:59.730 --> 28:01.743
Swartz threw his energy into a string of new

28:01.743 --> 28:04.731
projects involving access
to public information,

28:04.731 --> 28:08.189
including an accountability
webside called Watchdog.net,

28:08.189 --> 28:10.799
and a project called The Open Library.

28:10.986 --> 28:15.299
So, the Open Library Project is a website
you can visit at openlibrary.org,

28:15.299 --> 28:19.778
and the idea is to be a huge wiki, an
editable website with one page per book.

28:19.778 --> 28:23.910
So for every book ever published, we want
to have a web page about it that combines

28:23.910 --> 28:29.551
all the information from publishers, from
booksellers, from libraries, from readers

28:29.551 --> 28:34.587
onto one site, and then gives you links
where you can buy it, you can borrow it,
or you can browse it.

28:34.587 --> 28:39.958
I love libraries. I'm the kind
of person who goes to a new city
and immediately seeks out the library.

28:39.958 --> 28:44.050
That's the dream of Open Library, is
building this website where both you can leap

28:44.050 --> 28:49.297
from book to book, from person to author,
from subject to idea, go through this vast tree

28:49.297 --> 28:54.127
of knowledge that's been embedded and lost
in big physical libraries, that's hard to find,

28:54.177 --> 28:59.086
that's not very well-accessible online.
It's really important because
books are our cultural legacy.

28:59.086 --> 29:01.283
Books are the place people
go to write things down,

29:01.283 --> 29:05.813
and to have all that swallowed up
by one corporation is kind of scary.

29:06.730 --> 29:10.771
How can you bring public
access to the public domain?

29:10.771 --> 29:14.828
It may sound obvious that you'd have
public access to the public domain,

29:14.828 --> 29:21.368
but in fact it's not true.
So the public domain should be free
to all, but it's often locked up.

29:21.378 --> 29:26.756
There's often guard cages. It's like having
a national park but with a moat around it,

29:26.756 --> 29:33.245
and gun turrets pointed out,
in case somebodymight want to actually
come and enjoy the public domain.

29:33.245 --> 29:39.458
One of the things Aaron was particularly
interested in was bringing public access
to the public domain.

29:39.458 --> 29:43.258
This is one of the things that
got him into so much trouble.

29:46.254 --> 29:52.794
I had been trying to get access to
federal court records in the United States.

29:54.458 --> 29:59.108
What I discovered was
a puzzling system called PACER.

29:59.518 --> 30:03.124
Which stands for Public Access
to Court Electronic Records.

30:03.124 --> 30:07.314
I started Googling, and that's
when I ran across Carl Malamud.

30:08.886 --> 30:14.997
Access to legal materials in the US
is a ten billion dollar per year business.

30:14.997 --> 30:23.004
PACER is just this incredible abomination of
government services. It's ten cents a page,

30:23.004 --> 30:27.471
it's this most braindead code you've
ever seen. You can't search it.
You can't bookmark anything.

30:27.471 --> 30:31.891
You've got to have a credit card,
and these are public records.

30:31.891 --> 30:37.429
US district courts are very important; it's
where a lot of our seminal litigation starts.

30:37.429 --> 30:44.369
Civil rights cases, patent
cases, all sorts of stuff.
Journalists, students, citizens and lawyers

30:44.369 --> 30:48.637
all need access to PACER,
and it fights them every step of the way.

30:48.637 --> 30:55.246
People without means can't see the law
as readily as people that have
that Gold American Express card.

30:55.246 --> 30:57.776
It's a poll tax on access to justice.

30:57.946 --> 31:04.096
You know, the law is the operating system of
our democracy, and you have to pay to see it?

31:04.246 --> 31:07.135
You know, that's not much of a democracy.

31:07.135 --> 31:11.869
They make about 120 million dollars
a year on the PACER system,

31:11.869 --> 31:18.236
and it doesn't cost anything near that,
according to their own records.
In fact, it's illegal.

31:18.937 --> 31:25.834
The eGovernment Act of 2002 states that the
courts may charge only to the extent necessary

31:25.834 --> 31:29.591
in order to reimburse
the costs of running PACER.

31:34.621 --> 31:40.160
As the founder of Public.Resource.Org,
Malamud wanted to protest 
the PACER charges.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.300
He started a program called
The PACER Recycling Project,

31:43.300 --> 31:47.297
where people could upload PACER
documents they had already paid for

31:47.297 --> 31:50.334
to a free database so others could use them.

31:50.334 --> 31:55.331
The PACER people were getting a lot of flack
from Congress and others about public access,

31:55.336 --> 32:00.925
and so they put together a system in
17 libraries across the country
that was free PACER access.

32:01.885 --> 32:07.625
You know, that's one library every
22,000 square miles, I believe,
so it wasn't like really convenient.

32:08.095 --> 32:12.173
I encouraged volunteers to join
the so-called Thumb Drive Corps,

32:12.173 --> 32:17.157
and download docs from
the public access libraries,
upload them to the PACER recycling site.

32:17.157 --> 32:20.813
People take a thumb drive
into one of these libraries,
and they download a bunch of documents,

32:20.813 --> 32:25.089
and they send them to me.
I mean, it was just a joke.

32:25.089 --> 32:28.636
In fact, when you clicked on Thumb
Drive Corps, there was a Wizard of Oz,

32:28.636 --> 32:32.111
you know, the Munchkins singing,
so a videoclip came up:

32:32.173 --> 32:35.034
# We represent the lollipop guild...#

32:35.260 --> 32:39.386
But of course, I get this phone calls
from Steve Shultz and Aaron, saying,

32:39.621 --> 32:43.047
"Gee, we'd like to join the Thumb Drive Corps"

32:43.377 --> 32:47.544
Around that time,
I ran into Aaron at a conference.

32:47.544 --> 32:51.633
This is something that really has to be a
collaboration between a lot of different people.

32:51.633 --> 32:53.347
So I approached him and I said,

32:53.347 --> 32:58.195
"Hey, I am thinking about an
intervention on the PACER problem."

32:59.865 --> 33:04.442
Schultz had already developed 
a program that could automatically
download PACER documents

33:04.442 --> 33:06.459
from the trial libraries.

33:06.459 --> 33:08.796
Swartz wanted to take a look.

33:08.796 --> 33:13.481
So, I showed him the code, and I
didn't know what would come next,

33:13.481 --> 33:19.033
but as it turns out, over the course of
the next few hours at that conference,

33:19.033 --> 33:24.588
he was off sitting in a corner,
improving my code, recruiting a friend of his

33:24.588 --> 33:32.139
that lived near one of these
libraries to go into the library,
and to begin to test his improved code.

33:32.139 --> 33:38.440
At which point the folks at the courts realized
something is not going quite according to plan.

33:38.440 --> 33:42.901
And data started to come in,
and come in, and come in

33:42.901 --> 33:47.632
and soon there was 760 GB of PACER docs,
about 20 million pages.

33:48.862 --> 33:52.098
Using information retrieved
from the trial libraries,

33:52.098 --> 33:57.304
Swartz was conducting massive automated
parallel downloading of the PACER system.

33:57.304 --> 34:04.360
He was able to acquire nearly
2.7 million Federal Court documents,
almost 20 million pages of text.

34:04.360 --> 34:09.864
Now, I'll grant you that 20 million pages had
perhaps exceed the expectations of the people

34:09.864 --> 34:14.534
running the pilot access project,
but surprising a bureaucrat isn't illegal.

34:14.830 --> 34:19.096
Aaron and Carl decided to go talk to
The New York Times about what happened.

34:19.731 --> 34:26.500
They also caught the attention of the FBI,
who began to stake out Swartz's
parents' house in Illinois.

34:26.639 --> 34:31.053
And I get a tweet from his mother,
saying, "Call me!!"

34:31.053 --> 34:34.127
So, I think, like,
what the hell's going on here?

34:34.127 --> 34:38.981
And so, finally I get a hold of Aaron and,
you know, Aaron's mother was like,
"Oh my God, FBI, FBI, FBI!"

34:40.271 --> 34:45.831
An FBI agent drives down our home's driveway,
trying to see if Aaron is in his room.

34:47.164 --> 34:51.899
I remember being home that day
and wondering why this car 
was driving down our driveway,

34:51.899 --> 34:55.110
and just driving back up. That's weird!

34:56.719 --> 35:04.953
Like, five years later I read this FBI file,
like, oh my goodness: that was the FBI agent,
in my driveway.

35:05.185 --> 35:09.009
He was terrified. He was totally terrified.

35:09.959 --> 35:14.920
He was way more terrified after the FBI
actually called him up on the phone,

35:15.280 --> 35:19.302
and tried to sucker him into coming down
to a coffee shop without a lawyer.

35:19.322 --> 35:23.664
He said he went home and lay down
on the bed and, you know, was shaking.

35:25.511 --> 35:30.006
The downloading also uncovered massive
privacy violations in the court documents.

35:30.242 --> 35:34.922
Ultimately, the courts were forced
to change their policies as a result,

35:34.922 --> 35:39.850
and the FBI closed their investigation
without bringing charges.

35:39.850 --> 35:42.722
To this day, I find it remarkable

35:42.722 --> 35:47.823
that anybody, even at the most remote
podunk field office of the FBI

35:47.823 --> 35:52.327
thought that a fitting use for taxpayer
dollars was investigating people

35:52.327 --> 35:55.491
for criminal theft on the grounds
that they had made the law public.

35:55.491 --> 35:57.746
How can you call yourself a lawman,

35:58.055 --> 36:02.055
and think that there could possibly be
anything wrong in this whole world

36:02.055 --> 36:03.815
with making the law public?

36:03.815 --> 36:09.455
Aaron was willing to put himself at risk
for the causes that he believed in.

36:09.455 --> 36:15.586
Bothered by wealth disparity,
Swartz moves beyond technology,
and into a broader range of political causes.

36:15.586 --> 36:21.786
I went into Congress, and I invited him
to come and hang out
and intern for us for a while

36:21.812 --> 36:25.182
so that he could learn the political process.

36:25.194 --> 36:31.194
He was sort of learning about new community
and new sets of skills and kind of learning
to hack politics.

36:31.194 --> 36:36.506
It seems ridiculous that miners should have
to hammer away until their whole bodies are
dripping with sweat

36:36.506 --> 36:41.276
faced with the knowledge that if they dare
to stop, they won't able to put food
on the table that night,

36:41.306 --> 36:46.576
while I get to make larger and larger
amounts of money each day just by
sitting and watching TV.

36:46.648 --> 36:48.898
But apparently the world is ridiculous.

36:49.025 --> 36:53.035
So, I co-founded a group called "The
Progressive Change Campaign Committee",

36:53.058 --> 36:58.298
and what we try and do is we try to
organize people over the Internet
who care about progressive politics

36:58.318 --> 37:00.568
and moving the country toward
a more progressive direction

37:00.570 --> 37:03.787
to kind of come together,
join our e-mail list, join our campaigns

37:03.787 --> 37:06.297
and help us to get progressive candidates
elected all across the country.

37:06.326 --> 37:12.656
The group is responsible for igniting the
grassroots effort behind the campaign to
elect Elizabeth Warren to the Senate.

37:12.806 --> 37:17.896
He might have thought it was a dumb system
but he came in and he said,
"I need to learn this system,

37:17.900 --> 37:21.480
because it can be manipulated
like any social system."

37:21.540 --> 37:25.850
But his passion for knowledge and
libraries didn't take a back seat.

37:25.855 --> 37:31.170
Aaron began to take a closer look at
institutions that publish academic
journal articles.

37:31.520 --> 37:35.630
By virtue of being students at a major
US university, I assume you have access

37:35.630 --> 37:38.760
to a wide variety of scholarly journals.

37:38.760 --> 37:43.851
Pretty much every major university in the
United States pays these sort of licensing
fees to organizations like

37:43.851 --> 37:50.952
JSTOR and Thompson Isi to get access
to scholarly journals that the rest
of the world can't read.

37:51.054 --> 37:57.278
These scholarly journals and articles
are essentially the entire wealth
of human knowledge online,

37:57.278 --> 38:02.278
and many have been paid for with
taxpayer money or with government grants,

38:02.413 --> 38:08.639
but to read them, you often have to
pay again handing over steep fees
to publishers like Reed-Elsevier.

38:08.801 --> 38:14.732
These licenses fees are so substantial
that people who are studying in India,
instead of studying in United States,

38:15.128 --> 38:18.937
don't have this kind of access. They are
locked out from all of these journals.

38:19.253 --> 38:23.247
They are locked out from
our entire scientific legacy.

38:23.247 --> 38:27.361
I mean, a lot of these journal articles,
they go back to The Enlightenment.

38:27.361 --> 38:32.467
Every time someone has written down
a scientific paper, it's been scanned,
digitized, and put in these collections.

38:32.467 --> 38:39.766
That is a legacy that has been brought
to us by the history of people doing
interesting work, the history of scientists.

38:39.766 --> 38:43.167
It's a legacy that should belong
to us as a commons, as a people,

38:43.167 --> 38:48.127
but instead, it has been locked up
and put online by an handful of
for-profit corporations

38:48.127 --> 38:53.044
who then try to get the maximum
profit they can out of it.

38:53.464 --> 38:58.769
So a researcher paid by the university
or the people publishes a paper,

38:58.769 --> 39:02.312
and at the very, very last step of
that process, after all the work is done,

39:02.312 --> 39:07.031
after all the original research is done
--the thinking, the lab work, the analysis,
after everything is done, at that last stage,

39:07.031 --> 39:13.359
then the researcher has to hand over
his or her copyright to this
multi-billion dollar company.

39:14.488 --> 39:18.238
And it's sick. It's an entire
economy built on volunteer labor,

39:18.238 --> 39:21.080
and then the publishers sit at
the very top and scrape off the cream.

39:21.930 --> 39:28.968
Talk about a scam.
One publisher in Britain made a profit
of three billion dollars last year.

39:28.968 --> 39:30.484
I mean, what a racket!

39:30.494 --> 39:34.321
JSTOR is just a very,
very small player in that story

39:34.321 --> 39:41.068
but for some reason, JSTOR is the player
that Aaron decided to confront.

39:41.068 --> 39:45.009
He'd gone to some conference around
Open Access and Open Publishing,

39:45.009 --> 39:47.070
and I don't know who
the person from JSTOR was,

39:47.070 --> 39:50.368
but I think they --at some point,
Aaron asked the question,

39:50.368 --> 39:54.606
"How much would it cost to
open up JSTOR in perpetuity?"

39:54.606 --> 39:58.225
And they gave some --I think it
was two hundred million dollars,

39:58.225 --> 40:00.422
something that Aaron
thought was totally ridiculous.

40:01.166 --> 40:07.452
Working on a fellowship at Harvard,
he knew users on MIT's famously open
and fast network next door

40:07.452 --> 40:12.238
had authorized access to the riches
of JSTOR. Swartz saw an opportunity.

40:12.238 --> 40:14.434
You have a key to those gates,

40:14.434 --> 40:19.694
and with a little bit of shell script magic,
you can get those journal articles.

40:21.302 --> 40:23.492
On September 24, 2010,

40:23.492 --> 40:27.301
Swartz registered a newly
purchased Acer laptop

40:27.301 --> 40:31.479
on the MIT network,
under the name "Garry Host".

40:31.479 --> 40:36.169
The client name was registered as
"GHost laptop".

40:36.169 --> 40:38.990
He doesn't hack JSTOR in the
traditional sense of hacking.

40:38.990 --> 40:40.943
The JSTOR database was organized,

40:40.943 --> 40:44.500
so it was completely trivial to
figure out how you could download
all the articles in JSTOR,

40:44.500 --> 40:46.567
because it was basically numbered.

40:46.567 --> 40:52.351
It was basically slash slash slash...
number article 444024 and -25 and -26.

40:52.351 --> 40:55.784
He wrote a Python script
called keepgrabbing.pi,

40:55.784 --> 40:58.607
which was like, keeping grabbing
one article after another.

40:58.607 --> 41:02.210
The next day, GHost laptop
begins grabbing articles, but soon,

41:02.210 --> 41:08.765
the computer's IP address is blocked.
For Swartz, it's barely a bump in the road.

41:08.765 --> 41:13.628
He quickly reassigns his computer's
IP address and keeps downloading.

41:13.628 --> 41:18.172
Well, JSTOR and MIT take a number of
steps to try to interfere with this,

41:18.172 --> 41:19.766
when they notice that this is happening,

41:19.766 --> 41:22.184
and when the more modest steps don't work,

41:22.184 --> 41:27.171
then at a certain stage, JSTOR 
just cuts off MIT from having 
access to the JSTOR database.

41:27.171 --> 41:29.713
So there's a kind of 
cat-and-mouse game around

41:29.713 --> 41:33.876
getting access to the JSTOR database.

41:33.876 --> 41:39.920
Aaron, ultimately, obviously is the cat
because he has more technical capability

41:39.920 --> 41:42.921
than the JSTOR database
people do in defending them.

41:42.921 --> 41:47.228
Eventually, there was an unlocked supply
closet in the basement of one of the buildings,

41:47.228 --> 41:51.495
and he went, instead of going through WiFi,
he went down there and he just plugged
his computer directly into the network

41:51.495 --> 41:56.541
and just left it there with an
external hard drive downloading
these articles to the computer.

41:56.541 --> 42:01.812
Unknown to Swartz, his laptop and
hard drive had been found by authorities.

42:02.882 --> 42:05.736
They didn't stop the downloads.

42:05.736 --> 42:09.001
Instead, they installed a surveillance camera.

42:10.584 --> 42:14.540
They found the computer in this room
in the basement of an MIT building.

42:15.382 --> 42:19.759
They could have unplugged it.
They could have waited for 
the guy to come back and said,

42:19.759 --> 42:23.764
"Dude, what are you doing,
you know, cut it out. Who are you?"

42:23.764 --> 42:25.887
They could have done all that
kind of stuff, but they didn't.

42:25.887 --> 42:30.182
What they wanted to do was film it
to gather evidence to make a case.

42:30.182 --> 42:36.477
That's the only reason
you film something like that.

42:37.667 --> 42:42.082
At first, the only person caught
on the glitchy surveillance camera

42:42.082 --> 42:46.475
was using the closet as a
place to store bottles and cans.

42:53.202 --> 42:57.033
But days later, it caught Swartz.

43:06.185 --> 43:10.658
Swartz is replacing the hard drive.
He takes it out of his backpack,

43:11.240 --> 43:14.517
leans out of frame for about five minutes,

43:15.014 --> 43:21.863
and then leaves.

43:37.238 --> 43:41.775
And then they organized, like, a stakeout
where, as he was biking home from MIT,

43:41.899 --> 43:44.554
these cops came out
from either side of the road,

43:44.614 --> 43:48.436
or something like that,
and started going after him.

43:49.199 --> 43:54.436
He describes that he was pressed down
and assaulted by the police.

43:55.207 --> 43:58.382
He tells me that they --it's unclear
that they were police that were after him.

43:58.382 --> 44:02.797
He thought that someone
was trying to attack him.

44:02.797 --> 44:05.914
He does tell me they beat him up.

44:08.395 --> 44:15.406
It was just devastating. The notion of
any kind of criminal prosecution
of anyone in our family or anything

44:15.406 --> 44:18.358
was so foreign and incomprehensible,
I didn't know what to do.

44:18.409 --> 44:24.232
Well, they execute search warrants at
Aaron's house, his apartment in Cambridge,
in his office at Harvard.

44:27.972 --> 44:33.587
Two days before the arrest,
the investigation had gone beyond JSTOR
and the local Cambridge police.

44:33.964 --> 44:37.661
It had been taken over by the
United States Secret Service.

44:38.061 --> 44:42.531
The Secret Service began investigating
computer and credit card fraud in 1984,

44:42.807 --> 44:46.060
but six weeks after the attack on 9/11,
their role expanded.

44:49.532 --> 44:56.061
President Bush used The Patriot Act to
establish a network of what they called
"Electronic Crimes Task Forces".

44:56.791 --> 45:01.328
The bill before me takes account
of the new realities and dangers
posed by modern terrorists.

45:01.643 --> 45:06.580
According to the Secret Service,
they are primarily engaged in
activity with economic impact,

45:06.841 --> 45:11.169
organized criminal groups, or use
of schemes involving new technology.

45:11.384 --> 45:15.866
The Secret Service turned Swartz's case
over to the Boston U.S. Attorney's office.

45:16.246 --> 45:18.722
There was a guy in the
US attorney's office who had the title:

45:19.054 --> 45:21.895
"Head of the Computer Crimes
Division or Task Force"

45:22.179 --> 45:24.317
I don't know what else he had going,

45:24.455 --> 45:29.477
but you're certainly not much of a
"Computer Crimes Prosecutor"
without a computer crime to prosecute,

45:29.994 --> 45:35.095
so he jumped on it, kept if for himself,
didn't assign it to someone else
within the office or the unit

45:35.564 --> 45:37.638
and that's Steve Heymann.

45:37.806 --> 45:41.896
Prosecutor Stephen Heymann has been
largely out of public view
since the arrest of Aaron Swartz,

45:41.896 --> 45:46.793
but he can be seen here, in an episode
of the television show "American Greed",

45:46.793 --> 45:49.550
filmed around the time of Aaron's arrest.

45:49.550 --> 45:53.378
He is describing his previous case against
the notorious hacker Alberto Gonzales,

45:53.652 --> 45:56.899
a case that garnered Heymann
enormous press attention and accolades.

45:57.273 --> 46:02.017
Gonzales masterminded the theft of over
a hundred million credit card and ATM numbers,

46:02.209 --> 46:04.537
the largest such fraud in history.

46:04.852 --> 46:09.983
Here, Heymann, describing Gonzales,
gives his view on the hacker mindset:

46:10.263 --> 46:16.178
These guys are driven by a lot of
the same things that we're driven by.

46:16.515 --> 46:24.774
They have an ego, they like challenge,
and of course they like money
and everything you can get for money.

46:25.134 --> 46:29.891
One of the suspects implicated 
in the Gonzales case was a young 
hacker named Jonathan James.

46:30.254 --> 46:33.127
Believing Gonzales' crimes
would be pinned on him,

46:33.420 --> 46:36.929
James committed suicide
during the investigation.

46:37.139 --> 46:40.865
In an early press release describing
the government's position in the case
of Aaron Swartz,

46:41.115 --> 46:45.974
Heymann's boss, US Attorney for the District
of Massachusets, Carmen Ortiz, said this:

46:46.521 --> 46:50.116
"Stealing is stealing, whether you
use a computer command or a crowbar,

46:50.116 --> 46:53.021
and whether you take
documents, data, or dollars."

46:53.731 --> 46:55.587
It is not true. It's obviously not true.

46:56.037 --> 46:57.717
I'm not saying it's harmless,

46:58.487 --> 47:04.102
and I'm not saying that we shouldn't
criminalize stealing of information,

47:04.318 --> 47:06.693
but you got to be much more subtle

47:09.063 --> 47:14.261
in trying to figure out exactly
which kinds of harms are harmful here.

47:14.897 --> 47:18.957
So the thing about a crowbar is, every time
I break into a place with a crowbar,

47:18.957 --> 47:21.768
I do damage. There is no doubt about it.

47:21.768 --> 47:24.005
But when Aaron writes a script that says

47:24.206 --> 47:28.329
download download download,
a hundred times in a second,

47:28.329 --> 47:31.047
there's no obvious damage to anybody.

47:31.047 --> 47:36.148
If he does that for the purpose of gathering
an archive to do academic research on it,

47:36.211 --> 47:38.621
there is never any damage to anybody.

47:38.659 --> 47:42.925
He wasn't stealing. He wasn't
selling what he got or giving it away.

47:42.925 --> 47:45.671
He was making a point,
for as far as I could tell.

47:45.671 --> 47:48.149
The arrest took its toll on Swartz.

47:48.230 --> 47:49.712
He just wouldn't talk about it.

47:49.819 --> 47:51.466
I mean, he was very stressed.

47:51.706 --> 47:56.424
If you would thought that the FBI
was going to come to your doorstep any day,

47:56.424 --> 47:59.604
anytime you went down the hall,
even to do your laundry,

47:59.604 --> 48:03.170
and they'd break in into your apartment
'cause you left the door unlocked,

48:03.170 --> 48:06.545
like...I'd be pretty stressed,

48:06.545 --> 48:12.727
and it was clear, and so Aaron
was always sort of like in a dour mood.

48:18.800 --> 48:24.093
He wouldn't give off any sensitive information
about his whereabouts during this time,

48:24.111 --> 48:28.345
because he was so afraid that
the FBI would be waiting for him.

48:31.445 --> 48:35.452
It was a time of unprecedented
social and political activism.

48:35.702 --> 48:41.811
Time Magazine would later name, as their
2011 Person of the Year, "The Protester".

48:42.348 --> 48:46.925
There was a kind of hotbed
of hacker activity going on.

48:49.056 --> 48:53.442
WikiLeaks had released a
trove of diplomatic cables,

48:53.907 --> 48:56.491
Manning had been under arrest at the time,

48:56.526 --> 48:59.933
it was unknown whether
he was the source of the leak.

49:00.586 --> 49:04.801
Anonymous, which is a kind
of protest ensemble that

49:04.801 --> 49:07.129
has a lot of hackers in its ranks,

49:07.834 --> 49:11.357
were going on various sprees of sorts.

49:11.745 --> 49:14.107
If you compare that to what he did,

49:14.107 --> 49:17.902
this stuff should have been left
behind for MIT and JSTOR to deal with,

49:18.596 --> 49:22.048
in a kind of private, professional matter.

49:22.395 --> 49:27.657
It should have never gotten
the attention of the criminal system.

49:28.425 --> 49:31.870
It just didn't belong there.

49:36.645 --> 49:39.720
Before he was indicted,
Swartz was offered a plea deal

49:40.151 --> 49:43.230
that involved three months in prison,
time in an halfway house,

49:43.230 --> 49:45.535
and a year of home detention,

49:45.599 --> 49:48.006
all without the use of a computer.

49:48.170 --> 49:52.460
It was on the condition that
Swartz plead guilty to a felony.

49:52.806 --> 49:56.789
Here we are: we have no discovery,
no evidence whatsoever

49:57.075 --> 49:58.793
about what the government's case is,

49:58.974 --> 50:01.821
and we have to make this immense decision

50:01.976 --> 50:05.464
where the lawyer is pushing you to do this,

50:05.746 --> 50:09.732
the government is giving you
a non-negotiable demand,

50:10.041 --> 50:13.360
and you're told that your
likelihood of prevailing is small,

50:13.617 --> 50:18.563
so whether you're guilty or not,
you're better off taking the deal.

50:18.908 --> 50:20.940
Boston has its own Computer Crimes Division,

50:21.315 --> 50:25.208
lots of lawyers, probably
more lawyers than they need.

50:25.999 --> 50:30.664
So, you know, you can imagine all sorts of
cases that will be really hard to prosecute,

50:30.737 --> 50:32.897
because you've got some criminals in Russia,

50:33.261 --> 50:35.997
or you've got some people
inside of a corporation

50:36.254 --> 50:40.028
that are gonna five hundred dollar lawyers
or seven hundred dollar-an-hour lawyers

50:40.028 --> 50:43.856
sitting down against you, and then
you've got this case with this kid,

50:44.156 --> 50:48.022
which is pretty easy to prove
that he did something,

50:48.049 --> 50:52.731
and he's already marked himself
as a troublemaker with the FBI,

50:52.837 --> 50:56.551
so why not go as tough as
you can against that guy?

50:56.551 --> 50:59.714
It's good for you the prosecutor.
It's good for the Republic,

50:59.714 --> 51:02.242
'cause you're fighting
all those terrorist types.

51:02.631 --> 51:03.996
I was so scared.

51:03.996 --> 51:06.053
I was so scared of having my computer seized.

51:06.053 --> 51:10.228
I was so scared of going to jail
because of my computer being seized.

51:10.338 --> 51:15.293
I had confidential material from sources
from my previous work on my laptop,

51:15.470 --> 51:20.517
and that is, above all, my priority
--is to keep my sources safe.

51:20.677 --> 51:25.220
I was so scared of what
was going to happen to Ada.

51:25.400 --> 51:27.764
Aaron told me that they'd offered him a deal,

51:28.136 --> 51:32.853
and he finally just said that
he would take it if I told him to,

51:33.180 --> 51:37.456
and I say--
I came real close to saying, "Take it."

51:37.673 --> 51:42.595
He had these --he had developed,
like, serious political aspirations

51:42.731 --> 51:45.622
in the intervening time,
between when, you know,

51:45.651 --> 51:51.218
that moment when he ended that
entrepreneurial start-up life,

51:51.406 --> 51:56.448
and begun this new life that
had come to this political activism,

51:57.077 --> 52:03.834
and he just didn't believe that he
could continue in his life with a felony.

52:04.180 --> 52:07.386
You know, he said to me one day,
we were walking by the White House,

52:07.386 --> 52:12.379
and he said to me,
"They don't let felons work there."

52:17.801 --> 52:22.031
And you know he really
--he really wanted that to be his life.

52:22.387 --> 52:25.440
He hadn't killed anybody.
He hadn't hurt anybody.

52:25.784 --> 52:28.298
He hadn't, like, stolen money.

52:28.489 --> 52:32.573
He hadn't done anything that
seemed felony-worthy, and...

52:34.793 --> 52:39.327
there is this idea that there is no
reason that he should be labelled a felon,

52:39.357 --> 52:42.892
and taken away his right
to vote in many states

52:43.363 --> 52:45.807
for doing what he did.
That's just outrageous.

52:45.807 --> 52:50.100
It makes sense for him to be
maybe fined a bunch of money,

52:50.100 --> 52:54.467
or asked not to come back to MIT again.

52:54.467 --> 52:59.454
But to be a felon? To face jail time?

53:01.516 --> 53:04.063
Swartz turned down the plea deal.

53:04.342 --> 53:07.188
Heymann redoubled his efforts.

53:07.523 --> 53:12.457
Heymann continued to press us at all levels.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.667
Even with the physical evidence
seized from Aaron's

53:15.988 --> 53:18.389
Acer computer harddrive and USB drive,

53:18.760 --> 53:21.503
the prosecutors needed
evidence of his motives.

53:21.913 --> 53:24.847
Why was Aaron Swartz
downloading articles from JSTOR,

53:25.199 --> 53:28.380
and just what did he plan to do with them?

53:29.284 --> 53:32.167
The government claim was that
he was planning to publish these.

53:32.709 --> 53:36.073
We don't really know whether
that was his real intention

53:36.310 --> 53:43.068
because Aaron also had a history of doing
projects where he'd analyze giant data sets

53:43.314 --> 53:45.443
of articles in order to learn
interesting things about them.

53:45.746 --> 53:48.101
The best evidence for that
was that when he was at Stanford,

53:48.353 --> 53:53.037
he also downloaded the whole
Westlaw legal database.

53:53.407 --> 53:55.948
In a project with Stanford law students,

53:56.115 --> 53:58.445
Swartz had downloaded the
Westlaw legal database.

53:58.676 --> 54:02.822
He uncovered troubling connections
between funders of legal research

54:02.822 --> 54:04.534
and favorable results.

54:04.764 --> 54:08.097
He did this amazing analysis
of for-profit companies

54:08.097 --> 54:11.698
giving money to law professors
who wrote law review articles

54:11.698 --> 54:15.517
which were then beneficial to,
like, Exxon during an oil spill.

54:15.637 --> 54:19.391
So it was a very corrupt system of
funding, you know, vanity research.

54:19.441 --> 54:22.694
Swartz had never released
the Westlaw documents.

54:23.046 --> 54:25.599
In theory, he could have been doing
the same thing about the JSTOR database.

54:25.955 --> 54:27.679
That would have been completely okay.

54:27.916 --> 54:33.521
If he were, on the other hand, intending
to create a competitive service to JSTOR,

54:33.600 --> 54:35.887
like, we're going to set up our own, you know,

54:36.075 --> 54:39.340
access to the Harvard Law Review
and charge, you know, money for it,

54:39.340 --> 54:42.632
then, okay, now it seems
like criminal violation

54:42.632 --> 54:45.044
because you are commercially
trying to exploit this material,

54:45.044 --> 54:48.336
but it's kind of crazy to imagine
that that was what he was doing.

54:48.830 --> 54:54.196
So, but then there's the middle case:
well, what if he was just trying to liberate
it for all of the developing world?

54:54.356 --> 54:57.195
But depending on what he was doing,
it creates a very different character

54:57.195 --> 55:00.728
to how the law should be thinking about it.
The government was prosecuting him

55:00.728 --> 55:03.666
as if this was like a
commercial criminal violation,

55:03.910 --> 55:06.853
like stealing a whole bunch of credit card
records, that it was that kind of crime.

55:07.001 --> 55:10.383
I don't know what he was
going to do with that database,

55:10.602 --> 55:13.845
but I heard from a friend of his
that Aaron had told him

55:14.014 --> 55:18.615
that he was going to analyze the data
for evidence of corporate funding
of climate change research

55:18.736 --> 55:24.212
that led to biased results,
and I totally believe that.

55:25.322 --> 55:28.638
I was just told that Steve wanted to talk to me,

55:29.052 --> 55:32.968
and I thought maybe this was
a way I could get out of this,

55:33.442 --> 55:35.138
just exit the situation,

55:35.508 --> 55:38.197
and I didn't want to live in fear
of having my computer seized.

55:38.579 --> 55:42.889
I didn't want to live in fear of having to
go to jail on a contempt of court charge

55:42.889 --> 55:46.661
if they tried to compel me
to decrypt my computer.

55:47.146 --> 55:50.546
When they came to me and said,
"Steve wants to talk to you,"

55:50.725 --> 55:52.856
that seemed reasonable.

55:53.209 --> 55:57.649
They offered Norton what is know as a
"Queen For A Day" letter or a proffer.

55:57.796 --> 56:00.822
It allowed prosecutors to
ask questions about Aaron's case.

56:01.131 --> 56:03.854
Norton would be given immunity
from prosecution herself,

56:04.137 --> 56:06.564
for any information she
revealed during the meeting.

56:06.787 --> 56:09.700
I didn't like it.
I told my lawyers repeatedly

56:09.923 --> 56:13.972
that I didn't... this seemed fishy,
I didn't like this, I didn't want immunity,

56:14.211 --> 56:16.325
I didn't need immunity,
I hadn't done anything,

56:16.566 --> 56:19.008
but they were really,
really stringent that there was--

56:19.172 --> 56:21.898
they did not want me meeting
the prosecutor without immunity.

56:22.144 --> 56:24.822
But just to be clear, this is a
"Queen For A Day" deal, a proffer.

56:24.822 --> 56:26.485
Right, a proffer letter.

56:26.485 --> 56:30.350
In which you basically handed
information to them in exchange
for protection from prosecution.

56:30.432 --> 56:35.713
So, it wasn't handing information over.
It was --at least that's not how I saw it--

56:35.944 --> 56:38.298
it was just having a discussion,
having an interview with them.

56:38.329 --> 56:40.979
-Well, they're asking you questions...
-They're asking me questions.

56:41.030 --> 56:43.043
-and they can ask about whatever they want...
-Right.

56:43.043 --> 56:45.565
- and whatever they learn...
-I really...

56:45.737 --> 56:49.983
-They can't have you prosecuted.
-Right, and I repeatedly tried to go in naked.

56:50.384 --> 56:53.448
I repeatedly --I repeatedly tried
to turn down the proffer letter.

56:53.837 --> 56:56.640
I was ill. I was being pressured by my lawyers.

56:56.864 --> 56:59.723
I was confused.
I was not doing well by this point.

57:02.582 --> 57:05.442
I was depressed, and I was scared, and
I didn't understand the situation I was in.

57:05.855 --> 57:08.960
I had no idea why I was in this situation.

57:09.329 --> 57:13.192
I hadn't done anything
interesting, much less wrong.

57:13.496 --> 57:15.365
We went out of our minds.

57:15.719 --> 57:19.280
Aaron was clearly very distraught about it.
We were very distraught about it.

57:19.361 --> 57:21.203
Aaron's attorneys were
very distraught about it.

57:21.414 --> 57:23.584
We tried to get Quinn to change attorneys.

57:23.997 --> 57:28.304
I was very unused to being in
a room with large men, well-armed,

57:28.304 --> 57:33.214
that are continually telling me I'm lying,
and that I must have done something.

57:33.566 --> 57:36.871
I told them that this thing
that they were prosecuting

57:37.177 --> 57:39.730
wasn't a crime.

57:40.763 --> 57:43.499
I told them that they were
on the wrong side of history.

57:43.714 --> 57:47.262
I used that phrase. I said,
"You're on the wrong side of history."

57:47.352 --> 57:52.297
And they looked bored. They didn't
even look angry. They just looked bored,

57:52.460 --> 57:57.610
and it began to occur to me that we
weren't having the same conversation.

57:57.610 --> 58:02.140
I mean, I told them
plenty of things about, you know,
why people would download journal articles,

58:02.140 --> 58:05.973
and eventually
--I don't remember what was around it--

58:05.973 --> 58:12.258
I mentioned that he'd done this blog post,
the "Guerilla Open Access Manifesto".

58:12.749 --> 58:16.130
This is the "Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto",

58:16.496 --> 58:20.032
supposedly written in July, 2008 in Italy.

58:20.673 --> 58:24.827
"Information is power. But like
all power, there are those who
want to keep it for themselves."

58:25.276 --> 58:30.149
"The world's entire scientific
and cultural heritage, published
over centuries in books and journals,

58:30.149 --> 58:33.634
is increasingly being digitized and locked
up by a handful of private corporations."

58:34.407 --> 58:38.320
"Meanwhile, those who have been
locked out are not standing idly by."

58:38.408 --> 58:41.087
"You have been sneaking through
holes and climbing over fences,

58:41.087 --> 58:44.633
liberating the information locked up by the
publishers and sharing them with your friends."

58:44.814 --> 58:47.812
"But all of this action goes on
in the dark, hidden underground."

58:48.088 --> 58:51.253
"It's called stealing or piracy,
as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were

58:51.253 --> 58:54.661
"the moral equivalent of plundering
a ship and murdering its crew."

58:54.931 --> 58:57.449
"But sharing isn't immoral
--it's a moral imperative."

58:57.666 --> 59:01.248
"Only those blinded by greed would
refuse to let a friend make a copy."

59:01.719 --> 59:04.356
"There's no justice in following unjust laws."

59:04.717 --> 59:08.413
"It's time to come into the light and,
in a grand tradition of civil disobedience,

59:08.639 --> 59:11.710
declare our opposition to this
private theft of public culture."

59:12.645 --> 59:18.572
The Manifesto itself was allegedly
written by four different people,
and also edited by Norton.

59:18.572 --> 59:21.603
But it was Swartz who
had signed his name to it.

59:21.964 --> 59:28.395
When it's over, I go immediately to Aaron and
tell him everything I can remember about it,

59:29.104 --> 59:32.411
and he gets very angry.

59:34.502 --> 59:37.669
The things that I'd done
shouldn't have added up that way.

59:40.078 --> 59:45.366
I hadn't done anything wrong,
and everything had gone wrong,

59:47.257 --> 59:49.639
but I was never...

59:57.302 --> 01:00:00.162
I'm still angry.

01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:06.610
I'm still angry that you could try your best
with these people to do the right thing,

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:09.325
and they'd turn everything against you.

01:00:09.325 --> 01:00:13.591
And they will hurt you with anything they can.

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:19.297
And in that moment,
I regret that I said what I did.

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:23.495
But my much larger regret is
that we have settled for this.

01:00:23.641 --> 01:00:25.947
That we are okay with this.

01:00:26.175 --> 01:00:28.012
That we are okay with the justice system,

01:00:28.012 --> 01:00:32.080
a system that tries to game people into
little traps so they can ruin our lives.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.178
So yeah, I wish I hadn't said that.

01:00:35.585 --> 01:00:40.812
But I'm much, much angrier
that this is where I am.

01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:47.505
That this is what we,
as a people, think is okay.

01:00:48.358 --> 01:00:52.187
They used every method that
I think they could think of

01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:56.973
to get her to provide information
which would be unhelpful to Aaron,

01:00:57.257 --> 01:01:00.169
and helpful to the prosecution of Aaron,

01:01:00.584 --> 01:01:07.240
but I don't think she had information
that was helpful to the government.

01:01:08.259 --> 01:01:12.051
Months go by, as Swartz's friends
and family await a looming indictment.

01:01:12.572 --> 01:01:17.142
In the meantime, Swartz was becoming a go-
to expert on a series of internet issues.

01:01:17.142 --> 01:01:19.826
...a question to you then:
do you think that the internet is something

01:01:19.826 --> 01:01:25.166
that should be considered a human right,
and something that the government cannot
take away from you?

01:01:25.436 --> 01:01:30.454
Yes, definitely, I mean this notion
that national security is an excuse
to shut down the internet,

01:01:30.576 --> 01:01:34.017
that's exactly what we heard in Egypt
and Syria and all these other countries,

01:01:34.017 --> 01:01:38.679
and so, yeah, it's true, sites like
WikiLeaks are going to be putting up
some embarassing material

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:42.553
about what the US government does,
and people are going to be 
organizing to protest about it

01:01:42.553 --> 01:01:45.661
and try and change their government.
You know, and that's a good thing,

01:01:45.661 --> 01:01:50.290
that's what all these First Amendment Rights
of free expression, of freedom of association
are all about,

01:01:50.308 --> 01:01:55.134
and so the notion that we should try
and shut those down I think, just goes
against very basic American principles.

01:01:55.238 --> 01:01:58.133
A principle, I think, is one that our
Founding Fathers would have understood.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.128
If the internet had been around back then,

01:02:00.128 --> 01:02:03.265
instead of putting "post offices" in the
Constitution, they would have put "ISPs".

01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:05.901
Well, it's definitely
interesting to see how far...

01:02:05.965 --> 01:02:10.566
Swartz meets activist Taren Stinebrickner-
Kauffman, and the two begin to date.

01:02:10.676 --> 01:02:12.599
We need a massive global public outcry.

01:02:12.648 --> 01:02:15.165
If there's no massive global public
outcry, it won't create any change.

01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:18.541
You know, four people in this city should
cause a massive global public outcry.

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:21.952
You know, we need a petition signer.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:25.809
Without telling her specifics,
he warned her he was involved in something

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:27.608
he called simply "The Bad Thing".

01:02:27.903 --> 01:02:33.039
And I had sort of crazy theories, like,
that he was having an affair with
Elizabeth Warren or something.

01:02:33.089 --> 01:02:37.890
I speculated both Hillary Clinton
and Elizabeth Warren, actually, but...

01:02:38.284 --> 01:02:41.410
So, sometime in probably late July,
Aaron called me,

01:02:41.814 --> 01:02:47.433
and I happened to pick up, and he said,
"The Bad Thing" might be in the news tomorrow.

01:02:47.433 --> 01:02:49.831
Do you want me to tell you,
or do you want to read about it in the news?"

01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:52.453
And I said, "Well, I want you to tell me."

01:02:53.433 --> 01:02:58.472
Aaron said,
"Well, I've been--I've been arrested

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:03.419
for downloading too many
academic journal articles,
and they want to make an example out of me."

01:03:04.329 --> 01:03:11.163
And I was like,
"That's it? That's the big fuss? Really?
It just doesn't sound like a very big deal."

01:03:11.225 --> 01:03:17.283
On July 14, 2011, federal prosecutors
indict Swartz on four felony counts.

01:03:17.482 --> 01:03:24.174
He gets indicted on the same day 
that two people in England 
who are part of LulzSec get arrested,

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:30.135
and a few other real hackers. And Aaron is
just someone who kind of looks like a hacker,

01:03:30.354 --> 01:03:34.917
enough that they can, you know, put his
head on a stake and put it on the gates.

01:03:35.022 --> 01:03:37.882
Aaron went to surrender,
and they arrested him.

01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:41.990
They then strip searched him,

01:03:42.548 --> 01:03:48.243
took away his shoelaces, took away his belt,
and left him in solitary confinement.

01:03:50.475 --> 01:03:54.247
The District of Massachusetts United States
Attorney's office released a statement

01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:57.832
saying, "Swartz faces up to 35 years in prison,

01:03:58.053 --> 01:04:00.940
to be followed by three years
of supervised release,

01:04:01.139 --> 01:04:05.002
restitution, forfeiture and a fine
of up to one million dollars."

01:04:06.786 --> 01:04:09.370
He is released on
one hundred thousand dollars bail.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.330
The same day, the primary
victim in the case, JSTOR,

01:04:12.738 --> 01:04:17.769
formally drops all charges against
Swartz, and declines to pursue the case.

01:04:18.139 --> 01:04:21.575
JSTOR --they weren't our friends;
they weren't helpful or friendly to us,

01:04:21.575 --> 01:04:25.595
but they also were just kind of like,
"We're not part of this."

01:04:25.675 --> 01:04:30.490
JSTOR, and their parent company,
ITHAKA, also sidestepped requests
to talk with this film.

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:33.524
But at the time,
they released a statement saying,

01:04:33.718 --> 01:04:37.696
"It was the government's decision
whether to prosecute, not JSTOR's."

01:04:38.497 --> 01:04:42.688
And so it's our belief that,
with that, the case will be over.

01:04:43.189 --> 01:04:48.230
That we should be able to get
Steve Heymann to drop the case,
or settle it in some rational way.

01:04:48.654 --> 01:04:50.762
And the government refused.

01:04:51.149 --> 01:04:52.856
Why?

01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:58.055
Well, because I think they wanted
to make an example out of Aaron,

01:04:58.369 --> 01:05:01.337
and they said they wanted
--the reason why they wouldn't

01:05:01.538 --> 01:05:05.644
move on requiring a felony
conviction and jail time

01:05:05.849 --> 01:05:13.255
was that they wanted to use this case as
a case for deterrence. They told us that.

01:05:13.255 --> 01:05:15.199
-They told you that?
-Yes.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.177
-This was going to be an example?
-Yes.

01:05:17.263 --> 01:05:19.730
-He was going to be made an example?
-Yes.

01:05:20.145 --> 01:05:21.857
Steve Heymann said that.

01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:26.477
Deterring who? There's other people out
there running around logging onto JSTOR,

01:05:26.679 --> 01:05:30.167
and downloading the articles
to make a political statement?
I mean, who are they deterring?

01:05:30.374 --> 01:05:34.551
It would be easier to understand
the Obama administration's

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:37.520
posture of supposedly being for deterrence

01:05:37.771 --> 01:05:40.756
if this was an administration
that, for instance,

01:05:40.845 --> 01:05:43.601
prosecuted arguably the
biggest economic crime

01:05:43.645 --> 01:05:45.527
that this country has seen
in the last hundred years.

01:05:45.527 --> 01:05:49.630
The crimes that were committed that led
to the financial crisis on Wall Street.

01:05:50.101 --> 01:05:52.140
When you start deploying

01:05:52.452 --> 01:05:56.329
the non-controversial idea of deterrence

01:05:56.513 --> 01:05:58.254
only selectively

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.909
you stop making a dispassionate
analysis of law-breaking

01:06:02.128 --> 01:06:06.663
and you started deciding to
deploy law enforcement resources

01:06:06.902 --> 01:06:10.223
specifically on the basis
of political ideology,

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:14.859
and that's not just undemocratic,
it's supposed to be un-American.

01:06:19.319 --> 01:06:24.382
Prosecutor Stephen Heymann later
reportedly told MIT's outside counsel

01:06:24.596 --> 01:06:27.317
that the straw that broke the camel's back

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:31.467
was a press release sent out by 
an organization Swartz founded 
called "Demand Progress".

01:06:31.633 --> 01:06:35.853
According to the MIT account, Heymann
reacted to the short statement of support,

01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:40.036
calling it a "wild internet campaign"
and a "foolish move"

01:06:40.036 --> 01:06:44.326
that moved the case from a human
one-on-one level to an institutional level.

01:06:44.486 --> 01:06:48.646
That was a poisonous combination:
a prosecutor who didn't want to lose face,

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:53.464
who had a political career in the offing,
maybe, and didn't want to have this 
come back and haunt them.

01:06:53.617 --> 01:06:57.747
You spend how many tax dollars
arresting someone for taking
too many books out of the library,

01:06:58.019 --> 01:07:01.469
and then got your ass handed
to you in court? No way!

01:07:01.615 --> 01:07:05.839
I then moved to try to put as much pressure
on MIT in various ways to get them

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.739
to go to the government, and request
the government to stop the prosecution.

01:07:11.472 --> 01:07:14.528
What was MIT's reaction to that?

01:07:14.704 --> 01:07:19.304
There doesn't seem to be any
reaction from MIT at that point.

01:07:23.131 --> 01:07:25.931
MIT doesn't defend Aaron

01:07:26.273 --> 01:07:30.583
which, to people inside of the
MIT community, seems outrageous,

01:07:30.737 --> 01:07:35.667
because MIT is a place that encourages
hacking in the biggest sense of the word.

01:07:35.956 --> 01:07:41.126
At MIT, the idea of going and
running around on roof and tunnels
that you weren't allowed to be in

01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:46.538
was not only a rite of passage,
it was part of the MIT tour,

01:07:46.971 --> 01:07:51.071
and lockpicking was a winter course at MIT.

01:07:51.353 --> 01:07:55.753
They had the moral authority
to stop it in its tracks.

01:07:56.233 --> 01:08:02.073
MIT never stood up and took a position
of saying to the Feds, "Don't do this."

01:08:02.221 --> 01:08:06.407
"We don't want you to do this.
You're overreacting. This is too strong."

01:08:06.407 --> 01:08:08.940
...that I'm aware of.

01:08:09.104 --> 01:08:14.474
They acted kind of like any corporation would.
They sort of--they helped the government,

01:08:14.706 --> 01:08:21.106
they didn't help us, unless they felt they
had to, and they never tried to stop it.

01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:25.840
MIT declined repeated requests to comment,

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:30.380
but they later released a report saying they
attempted to maintain a position of neutrality,

01:08:30.577 --> 01:08:36.076
and believed Heymann and the
US Attorney's office did not care what
MIT thought or said about the case.

01:08:36.252 --> 01:08:41.881
MIT's behaviour seemed really
at odds with the MIT ethos.

01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:47.198
You could argue that MIT turned a blind eye,
and that was okay for them to do,

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:52.599
but taking that stance --taking that
neutral stance, in and of itself
--was taking a pro-prosecutor stance.

01:08:52.845 --> 01:08:55.831
If you look at Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak,

01:08:55.831 --> 01:09:01.451
they started by selling a Blue Box,
which was a thing designed to 
defraud the phone company.

01:09:01.627 --> 01:09:04.861
If you look at Bill Gates and Paul Allen,

01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:08.850
they initially started their business
by using computer time at Harvard,

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:11.441
which was pretty clearly against the rules.

01:09:11.602 --> 01:09:13.761
The difference between Aaron
and the people I just mentioned

01:09:13.761 --> 01:09:17.952
is that Aaron wanted to
make the world a better place,
he didn't just want to make money.

01:09:18.984 --> 01:09:23.151
Swartz continues to be outspoken
on a variety of internet issues.

01:09:23.624 --> 01:09:28.868
You know, the reason the internet works
is because of the competitive marketplace
of ideas,

01:09:29.001 --> 01:09:33.068
and what we need to be focusing on is
getting more information about our government,
more accessibility,

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:38.484
more discussion, more debate, but instead
it seems like what congress is focused on
is shutting things down.

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:44.319
Aaron thought he could change the world just
by explaining the world very clearly to people.

01:09:44.638 --> 01:09:48.728
Flame can literally control your computer,
and make it spy on you.

01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:52.519
Welcome, Aaron.
Good to have you back on the show here.

01:09:52.519 --> 01:09:56.909
You know, just like spies used
to in olden days, put microphones
and tap what people were saying,

01:09:56.975 --> 01:09:59.735
now they're using computers
to do the same things.

01:09:59.807 --> 01:10:01.896
Swartz's political activity continues,

01:10:01.936 --> 01:10:06.676
his attention turning to a bill moving through
Congress designed to curb online piracy.

01:10:06.865 --> 01:10:08.709
It was called "SOPA".

01:10:09.054 --> 01:10:13.174
Activists like Peter Eckersley
saw it as an enormous overreach,

01:10:13.264 --> 01:10:16.254
threatening the technical integrity
of the Internet itself.

01:10:16.351 --> 01:10:18.791
And one of the first things
I did was to call Aaron.

01:10:18.829 --> 01:10:22.359
And I said, "Can we do a big
online campaign against this?"

01:10:22.432 --> 01:10:24.982
"This isn't a bill about copyright."

01:10:25.136 --> 01:10:26.576
"It's not?"

01:10:26.658 --> 01:10:30.408
"No," he said,
"it's a bill about the freedom to connect."

01:10:30.815 --> 01:10:32.475
Now I was listening.

01:10:32.703 --> 01:10:36.113
And he thought about it for a while,
and then said, "Yes."

01:10:36.282 --> 01:10:38.752
And he went and founded Demand Progress.

01:10:38.838 --> 01:10:44.184
Demand Progress is an online activism
organization, we've got around
a million and a half members now,

01:10:44.184 --> 01:10:47.231
but started in the fall of 2010.

01:10:47.422 --> 01:10:50.612
Aaron was one of the most prominent
people in a community of people

01:10:50.692 --> 01:10:55.780
who helped lead organizing
around social justice issues
at the federal level in this country.

01:10:55.930 --> 01:11:01.424
SOPA was the bill that was intended to
curtail online piracy of music and movies,

01:11:01.543 --> 01:11:06.993
but what it did was basically
take a sledgehammer to a problem
that needed a scalpel.

01:11:07.161 --> 01:11:13.368
If passed, the law would allow
a company to cut off finances
to entire websites without due process,

01:11:13.594 --> 01:11:16.834
or even to force Google to exclude their links.

01:11:16.834 --> 01:11:21.173
All they needed was a single
claim of copyright infringement.

01:11:21.173 --> 01:11:27.180
It pitted the titans of
traditional media against a new and now
far more sophisticated remix culture.

01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:30.490
It makes everyone who runs
a website into a policeman,

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:34.167
and if they don't do their job of making sure
that nobody on their site uses it for anything

01:11:34.299 --> 01:11:38.799
that's even potentially illegal,
the entire site can get shut down
without even so much as a trial.

01:11:38.958 --> 01:11:43.728
This was over the top, I mean,
this was a catastrophe.

01:11:43.941 --> 01:11:51.687
This bill poses a serious threat to speech and
civil liberties for all who use the internet.

01:11:51.922 --> 01:11:55.614
There were only a handful of us who said,
"Look, we're not for piracy either,

01:11:55.914 --> 01:12:00.517
but it makes no sense to destroy
the architecture of the internet,

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:05.557
the domain name system and so much
that makes it free and open 
in the name of fighting piracy,

01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:08.022
and Aaron got that right away.

01:12:08.117 --> 01:12:11.977
The freedoms, guaranteed in our Constitution,
the freedoms our country had been built on

01:12:12.057 --> 01:12:14.497
would be suddenly deleted.

01:12:14.679 --> 01:12:18.779
New technology, instead of
bringing us greater freedom,
would have snuffed out fundamental rights

01:12:18.821 --> 01:12:21.382
we'd always taken for granted.

01:12:21.492 --> 01:12:27.260
And I realized that day, talking to Peter,
that I couldn't let that happen.

01:12:28.483 --> 01:12:33.508
When SOPA was introduced in October, 2011,
it was considered inevitable.

01:12:33.715 --> 01:12:37.617
Our strategy, when it first came out,
was to hopefully slow the bill down,

01:12:37.617 --> 01:12:41.797
maybe weaken it a little bit but, even we

01:12:41.797 --> 01:12:44.828
didn't think that we would be
able to stop this bill.

01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:52.025
Having worked in Washington, what you learn
is that, typically in Washington,

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:57.822
the legislative fights are fights between
different sets of corporate monied interests.

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:02.223
They're all duking it out to pass legislation,
and the fights that are the closest

01:13:02.693 --> 01:13:07.143
are when you have one set of
corporate interests against
another set of corporate interests,

01:13:07.363 --> 01:13:11.264
and they're financially equally matched in
terms of campaign contributions and lobbying.

01:13:11.437 --> 01:13:13.269
Those are the closest ones.

01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:16.413
The ones that aren't even fights,
typically, are ones

01:13:16.413 --> 01:13:20.676
where all the money is on one side,
all the corporations are on one side,

01:13:20.691 --> 01:13:23.603
and it's just millions of
people on the other side.

01:13:25.257 --> 01:13:30.369
I haven't seen anything like PIPA and SOPA
in all my time in public service.

01:13:30.676 --> 01:13:36.587
There were more than forty United States
senators on that bill as co-sponsors,

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:40.534
so they were already a long,
long way to getting the

01:13:40.534 --> 01:13:43.968
sixty votes to have it clear
all the procedural hoops.

01:13:44.456 --> 01:13:47.603
Even I began to doubt myself.
It was a rough period.

01:13:48.112 --> 01:13:53.381
Swartz and Demand Progress were able
to marshal enormous support
using traditional outreach,

01:13:53.605 --> 01:13:59.267
combined with commonly used voiceover IP,
to make it very easy for people
to call Congress.

01:14:00.011 --> 01:14:03.847
I've never met anybody else
who was able to operate at his level

01:14:03.847 --> 01:14:07.985
both on the technological side
and on the campaign strategy side.

01:14:08.867 --> 01:14:12.669
Millions of people contacted Congress
and signed anti-SOPA petitions.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.922
Congress was caught off guard.

01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:20.233
There was just something about watching those
clueless members of Congress debate the bill,

01:14:20.478 --> 01:14:22.897
watching them insist they
could regulate the internet,

01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:25.248
and a bunch of nerds
couldn't possibly stop them.

01:14:25.248 --> 01:14:26.390
I am not a nerd.

01:14:26.621 --> 01:14:28.084
I'm just not enough of a nerd...

01:14:28.398 --> 01:14:31.120
Maybe we oughta ask some nerds
what this thing really does.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.413
Let's have a hearing, bring in the nerds...

01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:37.689
Really?

01:14:40.287 --> 01:14:41.275
"Nerds"?

01:14:42.361 --> 01:14:45.689
You know, I think, actually the word
you're looking for is "experts"...

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:51.625
to enlighten you so your laws don't backfire

01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:53.568
and break the internet.

01:14:53.714 --> 01:14:57.033
We use the term "geek" but we're
allowed to use that because we are geeks.

01:14:57.329 --> 01:15:01.521
The fact that it got as far as it did,
without them talking to any technical experts,

01:15:01.905 --> 01:15:04.839
reflects the fact that
there is a problem in this town.

01:15:05.198 --> 01:15:12.138
I'm looking for somebody to come before
this body, and testify in a hearing and say,
"This is why they're wrong."

01:15:12.439 --> 01:15:15.421
There used to be an office that
provided science and technology advice,

01:15:15.741 --> 01:15:19.208
and members could go to them and say,
"Help me understand X,Y,Z."

01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:22.375
And Gingrich killed it.
He said it was a waste of money.

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:26.118
Ever since then,
Congress has plunged into the Dark Ages.

01:15:26.529 --> 01:15:29.554
I don't think anybody really thought that
SOPA could be beaten, including Aaron.

01:15:30.464 --> 01:15:34.113
It was worth trying,
but it didn't seem winnable,

01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:38.653
and I remember, maybe a few months later,
I remember him just turning to me
and being like,

01:15:38.653 --> 01:15:40.700
"I think we might win this."

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.949
And I was like, "That would be amazing."

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:46.134
Calls to Congress continue.

01:15:46.317 --> 01:15:50.512
When the domain hosting site Go Daddy
becomes a supporter of the bill,

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:54.902
tens of thousands of users transferred
their domain names in protest.

01:15:55.272 --> 01:16:00.084
Within a week, a humbled Go Daddy
reverses their position on SOPA.

01:16:00.376 --> 01:16:05.962
When the congress people that supported
the record and movie industries,

01:16:06.383 --> 01:16:10.707
realized that there was this backlash,
they kind of scaled the bill back a little bit.

01:16:10.879 --> 01:16:16.081
You could see the curve happening.
You could see that our arguments
were starting to resonate.

01:16:16.357 --> 01:16:19.034
It was like Aaron had been striking
a match and it was being blown out,

01:16:19.034 --> 01:16:21.055
striking another one,
and it was being blown out,

01:16:21.055 --> 01:16:24.645
and finally he'd managed to catch enough
kindling that the flame actually caught,

01:16:24.692 --> 01:16:27.590
and then it turned into this roaring blaze.

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:31.743
On January 16, 2012,
the White House issued a statement

01:16:31.743 --> 01:16:34.326
saying they didn't support the bill.

01:16:34.348 --> 01:16:36.603
And then this happened:

01:16:36.662 --> 01:16:40.202
I'm a big believer that we
should be dealing with issues of piracy,

01:16:40.202 --> 01:16:44.745
and we should deal with them in a serious
way, but this bill is not the right bill.

01:16:44.924 --> 01:16:48.965
When Jimmy Wales put his support
toward blacking out Wikipedia,

01:16:49.337 --> 01:16:52.520
the number five most popular
website in the world,

01:16:52.849 --> 01:16:58.789
this is a website that's seven percent of all
of the clicks on anywhere on the internet.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.089
Wikipedia went black.

01:17:00.165 --> 01:17:01.141
Reddit went black.

01:17:01.233 --> 01:17:03.221
Craigslist went black.

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:06.050
The phone lines on
Capitol Hill flat out melted.

01:17:06.179 --> 01:17:10.295
Members of Congress started rushing
to issue statements retracting
their support for the bill

01:17:10.815 --> 01:17:13.927
that they were promoting
just a couple days ago.

01:17:14.106 --> 01:17:17.698
Within 24 hours, the number of
opponents of SOPA in Congress

01:17:17.853 --> 01:17:19.215
went from this...

01:17:19.457 --> 01:17:22.591
to this.

01:17:22.796 --> 01:17:29.815
To see congressmen and senators slowly flip
sides throughout the day of the blackout

01:17:30.051 --> 01:17:31.825
was pretty unbelievable.

01:17:32.175 --> 01:17:35.210
There was like a hundred representative swing.

01:17:35.378 --> 01:17:38.746
And that was when, as hard as it was
for me to believe, after all this,

01:17:38.924 --> 01:17:40.756
we had won.

01:17:41.049 --> 01:17:43.210
The thing that everyone said was impossible,

01:17:43.459 --> 01:17:46.486
that some of the biggest companies in the
world had written off as kind of a pipedream,

01:17:46.779 --> 01:17:48.697
had happened.

01:17:49.142 --> 01:17:50.467
We did it.

01:17:50.933 --> 01:17:52.689
We won.

01:17:52.909 --> 01:17:55.525
_

01:17:55.945 --> 01:17:58.781
This is a historic week in internet politics
maybe American politics.

01:17:59.081 --> 01:18:04.069
The thing that we heard
from people in Washington, DC,
from the staffers on Capitol Hill was:

01:18:04.478 --> 01:18:08.664
they received more emails and more
phone calls on SOPA Blackout Day

01:18:08.908 --> 01:18:11.080
than they'd ever received about anything.

01:18:11.317 --> 01:18:13.224
I think that was an extremely exciting moment.

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:17.640
This was the moment when the
internet had grown up, politically.

01:18:17.934 --> 01:18:21.463
It was exhilarating because it's hard
to believe it actually happened.

01:18:21.658 --> 01:18:25.365
It's hard to believe a bill with
so much financial power behind it

01:18:25.679 --> 01:18:29.157
didn't simply sail through the Congress.

01:18:29.541 --> 01:18:32.167
And not only did not sail through,
it didn't pass at all.

01:18:34.153 --> 01:18:36.669
It's easy sometimes to feel
like you're powereless,

01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:40.524
like when you come out on the streets and
you march and you yell and nobody hears you.

01:18:40.889 --> 01:18:43.568
But I'm here to tell you today,
you are powerful.

01:18:46.295 --> 01:18:50.936
So, yeah, maybe sometimes you feel
like you're not being listened to,
but I'm here to tell you that you are.

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:53.400
You are being listened to.
You are making a difference.

01:18:53.588 --> 01:18:56.992
You can stop this bill
if you don't stop fighting.

01:19:00.049 --> 01:19:01.170
Stop PIPA.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:02.916
Stop SOPA.

01:19:04.182 --> 01:19:07.648
Some of the biggest internet companies,
to put it frankly, would benefit

01:19:07.648 --> 01:19:11.219
from a world in which their
little competitors could get censored.

01:19:12.519 --> 01:19:15.106
We can't let that happen.

01:19:15.172 --> 01:19:19.291
For him, it was more important to be sure
that you made a small change

01:19:19.612 --> 01:19:23.271
than to play a small part in a big change.

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:28.187
But SOPA was like playing
a major part in a major change,

01:19:28.187 --> 01:19:30.753
and so for him,
it was kind of this proof of concept

01:19:30.753 --> 01:19:35.069
like, "Okay, what I want to do
with my life is change the world."

01:19:35.326 --> 01:19:39.471
"I think about it in this really
scientific way of measuring my impact,

01:19:39.725 --> 01:19:42.813
and this shows that it's possible."

01:19:43.081 --> 01:19:45.810
"The thing that I want to do
with my life is possible."

01:19:46.078 --> 01:19:48.763
"I have proved that I can do it,

01:19:48.763 --> 01:19:50.999
that I, Aaron Swartz, can change the world."

01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:57.516
For a guy who never really thought
he had done much --which was Aaron--

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:04.115
was one of the few moments
where you could really see

01:20:04.115 --> 01:20:06.769
that he felt like he had done something good,

01:20:06.994 --> 01:20:11.836
feeling like here is his
maybe one and only victory lap.

01:20:13.828 --> 01:20:16.060
Everyone said there was
no way we could stop SOPA.

01:20:16.194 --> 01:20:17.903
We stopped it.

01:20:17.997 --> 01:20:22.576
This is three outrageously good victories,
and the year isn't even over yet.

01:20:22.747 --> 01:20:26.257
I mean, if there's a time
to be positive, it's now.

01:20:26.847 --> 01:20:29.700
You know, he wins at SOPA
a year after he's arrested.

01:20:29.989 --> 01:20:33.529
It's not unambiguously happy moments.
There's a lot going on.

01:20:33.813 --> 01:20:40.334
He's so attuned towards participating in
the political process, you can't stop him.

01:20:40.576 --> 01:20:44.521
The list of organizations Swartz
founded or co-founded is enormous,

01:20:44.831 --> 01:20:48.074
and years before Edward Snowden would
expose widespread internet surveillance,

01:20:48.402 --> 01:20:50.959
Swartz was already concerned.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:55.200
It is shocking to think that
the accountability is so lax

01:20:55.404 --> 01:20:59.777
that they don't even have sort of basic
statistics about how big the spying program is.

01:20:59.857 --> 01:21:03.863
And if the answer is: oh, we're spying on so
many people we can't possibly even count them

01:21:04.186 --> 01:21:06.483
then that's an awful lot of people.

01:21:06.811 --> 01:21:10.063
It'd be one thing if they said, "Look, we
know the number of telephones we're spying on,

01:21:10.063 --> 01:21:12.953
we don't know exactly how many
real people that corresponds to."

01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:15.916
but they just came back and said,
"We can't give you a number at all."

01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:18.644
That's pretty--I mean, that's scary, is what it is.

01:21:18.881 --> 01:21:25.502
And they put incredible pressure on him,
took away all of the money he had made.

01:21:25.803 --> 01:21:29.538
They, you know, threatened to
take away his physical freedom.

01:21:29.937 --> 01:21:33.788
Why'd they do it, you know? I mean, well,
why are they going after whistleblowers?

01:21:34.741 --> 01:21:38.813
You know, why are they going
after people who tell the truth

01:21:39.114 --> 01:21:46.122
about all sorts of things,
I mean, from the banks, to war,
to just sort of government transparency.

01:21:46.744 --> 01:21:49.776
So secrecy serves those
who are already in power,

01:21:50.026 --> 01:21:55.097
and we are living in an era of secrecy
that coincides with an era
where the government is doing, also,

01:21:55.278 --> 01:21:58.410
a lot of things that are
probably illegal and unconstitutional.

01:21:58.841 --> 01:22:01.941
So, those two things are not coincidences.

01:22:02.154 --> 01:22:04.378
It's very clear that this
technology has been developed

01:22:04.731 --> 01:22:10.080
not for small countries overseas,
but right here, for use in the United States,
by the US government.

01:22:10.331 --> 01:22:14.351
The problem with the spying program is it's
this sort of long, slow expansion, you know,

01:22:14.604 --> 01:22:17.124
going back to the Nixon administation, right,

01:22:17.319 --> 01:22:20.082
obviously it became big
after 9/11 under George W. Bush,

01:22:20.316 --> 01:22:23.536
and Obama has continued to expand it, and the
problems have slowly grown worse and worse,

01:22:24.028 --> 01:22:27.553
but there's never been this
moment you can point to and say,

01:22:27.701 --> 01:22:31.941
"Okay, we need to galvanize opposition
today because today is when it matters..."

01:22:32.455 --> 01:22:38.959
The prosecution, in my estimation
of Aaron Swartz, was about sending
a particular, laserlike message

01:22:39.363 --> 01:22:45.413
to a group of people that
the Obama administration
sees as politically threatening,

01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:54.141
and that is, essentially,
the hacker, the information,
and the democracy activist community,

01:22:54.447 --> 01:22:59.702
and the message that the Obama
administration wanted to send 
to that particular community was,

01:22:59.905 --> 01:23:05.113
in my estimation, "We know you have the
ability to make trouble for the establishment,

01:23:05.335 --> 01:23:08.677
and so we are going to try to
make an example out of Aaron Swartz

01:23:08.977 --> 01:23:13.418
to scare as many of you as possible
into not making that trouble."

01:23:13.843 --> 01:23:17.160
And the government said,
"Oh, the legal opinions we're using

01:23:17.382 --> 01:23:20.453
to legalize the spying program
are also classified,

01:23:20.786 --> 01:23:23.666
so we can't even tell you
which laws we're using to spy on you."

01:23:24.011 --> 01:23:26.461
You know, every time they can say,
"Oh, this is another instance of cyberwar.

01:23:26.685 --> 01:23:30.201
The cybercriminals are attacking us again.
We're all in danger. We're all under threat."

01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:33.737
They use those as excuses to push
through more and more dangerous laws.

01:23:35.563 --> 01:23:40.388
And so just to follow --personally,
how do you feel the fight is going?

01:23:40.947 --> 01:23:42.404
It's up to you!

01:23:42.404 --> 01:23:46.264
I know. It's just that we gotta, you know...

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:52.738
You know, there's sort of these
two polarizing perspectives, right,

01:23:52.936 --> 01:23:57.422
everything is great, the internet has
created all this freedom and liberty,
and everything's going to be fantastic

01:23:57.422 --> 01:23:59.093
or everything is terrible,

01:23:59.093 --> 01:24:01.914
the internet has created all these
tools for cracking down and spying,

01:24:01.972 --> 01:24:03.762
and controlling what we say.

01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:05.700
And the thing is, both are true, right?

01:24:05.948 --> 01:24:10.040
The internet has done both, and both
are kind of amazing and astonishing

01:24:10.386 --> 01:24:13.287
and which one will win out
in the long run is up to us.

01:24:13.443 --> 01:24:17.244
It doesn't make sense to say,
"Oh, one is doing better than the other".
You know, they're both true.

01:24:17.501 --> 01:24:21.097
And it's up to us which ones we emphasize
and which ones we take advantage of

01:24:21.233 --> 01:24:23.600
because they're both there,
and they're both always going to be there.

01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:35.010
On September 12, 2012, federal prosecutors
filed a superseding indictment against Swartz,

01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:40.170
adding additional counts of wire fraud,
unauthorized access to a computer,
and computer fraud.

01:24:40.825 --> 01:24:45.557
Now, instead of four felony counts,
Swartz was facing thirteen.

01:24:45.882 --> 01:24:48.835
The prosecution's leverage
had dramatically increased,

01:24:49.043 --> 01:24:52.294
as did Swartz's potential jail time and fines.

01:24:52.294 --> 01:24:55.417
They filed a separate
indictment to add more charges,

01:24:55.804 --> 01:25:01.526
and they had a theory about why this conduct
constituted a number of federal crimes,

01:25:01.899 --> 01:25:06.010
and that a very significant sentence
could attach to it under the law.

01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:10.426
That theory, and much of the
prosecution's case against Swartz

01:25:10.904 --> 01:25:13.862
involved a law created originally in 1986.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.663
It is called the
"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act".

01:25:16.996 --> 01:25:18.660
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:22.261
was inspired by the movie "War Games"
with Matthew Broderick --great movie.

01:25:22.478 --> 01:25:23.954
I have you now.

01:25:23.954 --> 01:25:27.895
In this movie, a kid gets the ability,
through the magic of computer networks

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:30.456
to launch a nuclear attack.

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:37.669
You know, that's not actually possible,
and it certainly wasn't possible in the '80s

01:25:37.854 --> 01:25:41.954
but apparently this movie scared Congress

01:25:42.005 --> 01:25:44.965
enough to pass the original
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

01:25:45.262 --> 01:25:48.711
This is a law that's just behind
the times, for example, it penalizes

01:25:49.431 --> 01:25:53.995
a terms of service kind of arrangement.
You can have something like

01:25:54.103 --> 01:26:01.111
eHarmony or Match.com, and somebody sort of
inflates their own personal characteristics,

01:26:01.409 --> 01:26:05.255
and all of a sudden, depending on
the jurisdiction and the prosecutors,

01:26:05.503 --> 01:26:07.958
they could be in a whole host of troubles.

01:26:08.172 --> 01:26:10.263
We all know what "Terms of Use" are.

01:26:10.594 --> 01:26:14.214
Most people don't read them, but not
abiding by their terms could mean

01:26:14.438 --> 01:26:16.461
you are committing a felony.

01:26:16.727 --> 01:26:19.024
The website Terms of Service
often say things like:

01:26:19.272 --> 01:26:22.492
"Be nice to each other", or
"Don't do anything that's improper."

01:26:22.789 --> 01:26:27.496
The idea that the Criminal Law has anything
to say about these kinds of violations,

01:26:27.668 --> 01:26:30.721
I think strikes most people as crazy.

01:26:30.938 --> 01:26:33.483
The examples get even more "crazy":

01:26:33.864 --> 01:26:39.557
Until it was changed in March of 2013,
the Terms of Use on the website of
Hearst's Seventeen magazine said

01:26:39.884 --> 01:26:43.258
you had to be eighteen in order to read it.

01:26:43.327 --> 01:26:46.674
I would say that the way the CFAA has been
interpreted by the Justice Department,

01:26:46.674 --> 01:26:49.223
we are probably all breaking the law.

01:26:49.589 --> 01:26:54.937
Vague and prone to misuse, the CFAA
has become a one-size-fits-all hammer

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.012
for a wide range of computer-related disputes.

01:26:58.121 --> 01:27:00.408
Though not the only factor in his case,

01:27:00.576 --> 01:27:04.935
eleven of the thirteen charges against Swartz
involved the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

01:27:07.248 --> 01:27:11.465
The question "Why?" hangs over
much of the story of Aaron Swartz.

01:27:11.815 --> 01:27:16.045
Just what was motivating the government,
and what would their case have been?

01:27:16.185 --> 01:27:19.945
The Department of Justice
declined requests for answers,

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.660
but Professor Orin Kerr is a former
prosecutor who has studied the case.

01:27:24.084 --> 01:27:28.109
So, I think I come about this case from
a different direction than other people
on a number of reasons:

01:27:28.359 --> 01:27:31.303
I was a federal prosecutor at
the Justice Department for three years

01:27:31.461 --> 01:27:34.191
before I started teaching.
The government came forward

01:27:34.191 --> 01:27:38.463
with an indictment based on what
crimes they thought were committed,

01:27:38.501 --> 01:27:42.176
just as a purely lawyer's matter, looking
at the precedents, looking at the statute,

01:27:42.505 --> 01:27:45.778
looking at the history, looking at
the cases that are out there so far,

01:27:45.974 --> 01:27:49.281
I think it was a fair indictment based on that.

01:27:49.526 --> 01:27:51.501
You can debate whether they
should have charged this case.

01:27:51.806 --> 01:27:56.825
There's just a lot of disagreement.
Some people are on the Open Access side,
some people are not.

01:27:57.681 --> 01:28:03.108
I think the government took Swartz's
"Guerilla Open Access Manifesto" very seriously

01:28:04.086 --> 01:28:09.706
and I think they saw him as somebody
who was committed, as a moral imperative,

01:28:10.059 --> 01:28:15.147
to breaking the law, to overcome
a law that Swartz saw as unjust,

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:20.968
and in a democracy, if you think a law is
unjust, there are ways of changing that law.

01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:24.465
There's going to Congress as
Swartz did so masterfully with SOPA,

01:28:24.662 --> 01:28:28.441
or you can violate that law in a way
to try to nullify that law,

01:28:28.834 --> 01:28:33.998
and I think what was driving the prosecution
was the sense that Swartz was committed,

01:28:34.205 --> 01:28:39.691
not just to breaking the law, but to
really making sure that law was nullified.

01:28:40.006 --> 01:28:43.890
That everyone would have access
to the database in a way that

01:28:44.054 --> 01:28:47.129
you couldn't put the
toothpaste back into the tube.

01:28:47.368 --> 01:28:51.199
It would be done, and Swartz's side would win.

01:28:52.815 --> 01:28:56.181
There's a big disagreement in society
as to whether that is an unjust law,

01:28:56.470 --> 01:29:00.357
and ultimately, that is a decision
for the American people to make,
working through Congress.

01:29:00.621 --> 01:29:03.547
And then the second problem is, I think,
we're still trying to figure out:

01:29:03.752 --> 01:29:07.706
What's the line between less serious
offences and more serious offences?

01:29:08.027 --> 01:29:12.317
We're now entering this different
environment of computers and computer misuse,

01:29:12.556 --> 01:29:16.840
and we don't yet have a really strong
sense of exactly what these lines are

01:29:17.044 --> 01:29:19.277
because we're just working that out.

01:29:19.650 --> 01:29:22.392
This is a poor use of prosecutorial discretion.

01:29:22.659 --> 01:29:25.891
The hammer that the Justice Department
has to scare people with

01:29:25.998 --> 01:29:28.700
just gets bigger and bigger and bigger,

01:29:28.914 --> 01:29:33.111
and so most people just -you know, you can't
roll the dice with your life like that.

01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.958
Should we tap somebody's phone?
Should we film them?

01:29:36.111 --> 01:29:39.413
Should we turn somebody and get them
to testify against these other people?

01:29:39.689 --> 01:29:42.366
That's how federal agents
and prosecutors think.

01:29:42.528 --> 01:29:44.974
They build cases. They make cases.

01:29:46.918 --> 01:29:51.452
Swartz was caught in the gears
of a brutal criminal justice system
that could not turn back,

01:29:51.746 --> 01:29:57.193
a machine that has made America
the country with the highest rate
of incarceration in the world.

01:29:57.571 --> 01:30:02.512
We have, in this country, allowed ourselves to
be captured by the politics of fear and anger,

01:30:02.905 --> 01:30:07.986
and anything we're afraid of, like
the future of the internet and access,

01:30:08.453 --> 01:30:13.233
and anything we're angry about, instinctively
creates a criminal justice intervention,

01:30:13.686 --> 01:30:18.924
and we've used jail, prison, and punishment
to resolve a whole host of problems

01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:23.007
that, historically, were never
seen as criminal justice problems.

01:30:23.223 --> 01:30:28.583
The impulse to threaten, indict,
prosecute, which is part of what

01:30:28.792 --> 01:30:32.138
has created this debate and controversy over
online access and information on the internet,

01:30:32.953 --> 01:30:35.706
is very consistent with what
we've seen in other areas.

01:30:35.928 --> 01:30:39.960
The one difference is that the people
who are usually targeted and victimized

01:30:40.327 --> 01:30:45.901
by these kinds of criminal and carceral
responses are typically poor and minority.

01:30:47.747 --> 01:30:50.860
Swartz's isolation from
friends and family increased.

01:30:51.222 --> 01:30:53.503
He had basically stopped
working on anything else,

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:57.283
and the case was, in fact,
taking over sort of his whole life.

01:30:57.296 --> 01:31:02.457
One of Aaron's lawyers apparently told the
prosecutors that he was emotionally vulnerable,

01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:07.333
and that that was something they really
needed to keep in mind so that they knew that.

01:31:07.333 --> 01:31:09.578
It was weighing on him very heavily.

01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:14.877
He did not like having his actions
and his movements restricted in any way,

01:31:15.754 --> 01:31:20.902
and the threat of jail,
which they pounded him with a lot,

01:31:21.919 --> 01:31:23.931
was terrifying to him.

01:31:23.931 --> 01:31:26.540
Completely exhausted his financial resouces,

01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:32.178
and it cost us a lot of money also,
and he raised a substantial amount of money,

01:31:32.511 --> 01:31:36.481
so it was, you know, it was
in the millions of dollars.

01:31:36.755 --> 01:31:38.551
- The legal defence?
- Yes.

01:31:38.551 --> 01:31:40.855
- Was in millions?
- Yes.

01:31:41.479 --> 01:31:43.995
I think he didn't want
to be a burden to people.

01:31:44.252 --> 01:31:47.786
I think that was a factor like,
"I have my normal life,

01:31:48.166 --> 01:31:50.291
and then I have this shitty thing
I have to deal with,

01:31:50.452 --> 01:31:53.259
and I try to keep the two of them
as separate as possible,

01:31:53.489 --> 01:31:57.484
but they were just beginning to blur
together and everything was becoming shitty."

01:31:59.333 --> 01:32:02.686
Swartz faced a tough choice
that was only getting tougher:

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:05.149
Do you admit guilt and move on with your life,

01:32:05.166 --> 01:32:07.458
or do you fight a broken system?

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:09.651
With his legal case, the answer was simple:

01:32:09.651 --> 01:32:13.079
He rejects a final plea deal
and a trial date is set.

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:17.174
Aaron was resolute that he didn't want
to knuckle under and accept something

01:32:17.381 --> 01:32:21.639
that he didn't believe was fair,
but I also think he was scared.

01:32:33.045 --> 01:32:34.912
I don't think they would have convicted Aaron.

01:32:35.113 --> 01:32:38.758
I think we would have walked
him out of that courthouse,
and I would have given him a big hug,

01:32:38.977 --> 01:32:44.344
and we would have walked across
that little river in Boston,
and gone and had a couple of beers.

01:32:45.752 --> 01:32:50.094
I really thought that we were right.
I thought that we were going to win the case.

01:32:50.094 --> 01:32:52.025
I thought that we could win the case.

01:32:52.025 --> 01:32:54.611
He didn't talk about it very much,
but you could see

01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:57.548
the enormous pain that he was going through.

01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:05.106
No time in his childhood did
Aaron have any severe mood swings

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:10.846
or depressive episodes or anything that
I would describe as "severe depression"

01:33:11.114 --> 01:33:13.962
and it's possible, you know,
he was depressed. People get depressed.

01:33:19.112 --> 01:33:23.415
Very early in our relationship,
three or four weeks in or something,

01:33:24.078 --> 01:33:26.730
I remember him saying to me

01:33:27.787 --> 01:33:30.711
that I was a lot stronger than he was.

01:33:30.947 --> 01:33:33.660
You know, he was brittle in a lot of ways.

01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:36.999
Things were a lot harder for him
than for a lot of people.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.810
That was part of his brilliance, too.

01:33:41.216 --> 01:33:46.909
I think he probably had something like
clinical depression in his early twenties.

01:33:47.228 --> 01:33:49.702
I don't think he did when I was with him.

01:33:49.971 --> 01:33:55.275
He wasn't a "joyful" person, but
that's different from being depressed.

01:33:56.843 --> 01:34:01.616
He was just under such enormous
pressure for two years straight.

01:34:01.842 --> 01:34:04.193
He just didn't want to do it anymore.

01:34:04.375 --> 01:34:07.729
He was just--I just think it was too much.

01:34:14.571 --> 01:34:17.320
I got a phone call late at night.

01:34:17.814 --> 01:34:23.091
I could tell something was wrong, and then
I called, and I realized what had happened.

01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:29.059
A co-founder of the social news
and entertainment website "Reddit"
has been found dead.

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:31.730
Police say 26-year-old Aaron Swartz

01:34:31.828 --> 01:34:35.585
killed himself yesterday
in his Brooklyn apartment.

01:34:37.539 --> 01:34:46.506
I just thought, we've lost one of the
most creative minds of our generation.

01:34:46.963 --> 01:34:51.096
I was like, the whole world
fell apart at that moment.

01:34:57.082 --> 01:35:00.299
It was one of the hardest nights of my life.

01:35:00.548 --> 01:35:04.883
I just kept screaming, "I can't hear you!
What did you say? I can't hear you!"

01:35:07.693 --> 01:35:09.240
I can't. That's it.

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.098
Okay.

01:35:16.408 --> 01:35:22.553
Yeah, none of it made any sense,

01:35:22.773 --> 01:35:25.180
and really still doesn't.

01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:27.561
I was so frustrated, angry.

01:35:38.217 --> 01:35:43.326
You know, I tried to explain it to my kids.

01:35:43.885 --> 01:35:47.198
My three-year-old told me
that the doctors would fix him.

01:35:52.576 --> 01:35:56.826
I've known lots of people that have died,
but I've never lost anybody like this,

01:35:56.984 --> 01:36:04.001
because everybody feels, and I do too, there
is so much we could have--more to do like...

01:36:05.102 --> 01:36:11.196
I just didn't know he was there. I didn't
know this was what he was suffering and...

01:36:11.656 --> 01:36:14.375
He was part of me.

01:36:16.585 --> 01:36:20.845
And I just wanted it to not be real, and then...

01:36:25.105 --> 01:36:29.367
and then I just looked at his
Wikipedia page and I saw the end date:

01:36:33.244 --> 01:36:35.761
"to 2013".

01:37:14.958 --> 01:37:19.636
My first thought was:
what if nobody even notices?

01:37:19.636 --> 01:37:24.108
You know, because it wasn't
clear to me how salient he was.

01:37:24.508 --> 01:37:30.060
I had never seen anything quite
like the outpouring I saw.

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:32.116
The Net just lit up.

01:37:32.116 --> 01:37:37.677
Everyone was trying to explain it
in their own way, but I've never seen

01:37:38.281 --> 01:37:40.356
people grieve on Twitter before.

01:37:40.356 --> 01:37:43.888
People were visibly grieving online.

01:37:46.552 --> 01:37:49.668
He was the internet's own boy,

01:37:50.115 --> 01:37:54.126
and the old world killed him.

01:37:55.747 --> 01:38:01.316
We are standing in the middle of a time
when great injustice is not touched.

01:38:02.204 --> 01:38:06.564
Architects of the financial meltdown
have dinner with the president, regularly.

01:38:06.564 --> 01:38:12.989
In the middle of that time, the idea that
this is what the government had to prosecute,

01:38:14.774 --> 01:38:17.859
It just seems absurd, if it weren't tragic.

01:38:17.859 --> 01:38:23.643
The question is: can we do something,
given what's happened,

01:38:23.643 --> 01:38:26.698
to make the world a better place,

01:38:26.698 --> 01:38:28.817
and how can we further that legacy?

01:38:28.817 --> 01:38:32.284
That's the only question one could ask.

01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:37.796
All over the world there are starting
to be hack-a-thons, gatherings,

01:38:37.971 --> 01:38:43.578
Aaron Swartz has, in some sense, brought
the best out of us, in trying to say:

01:38:44.044 --> 01:38:47.079
How do we fix this?

01:38:47.994 --> 01:38:52.892
He was, in my humble opinion, one of
the true extraordinary revolutionaries

01:38:52.892 --> 01:38:55.817
that this country has produced.

01:38:55.817 --> 01:38:59.504
I don't know whether Aaron
was defeated or victorious,

01:38:59.715 --> 01:39:05.939
but we are certainly shaped by the
hand of the things that he wrestled with.

01:39:06.089 --> 01:39:12.430
When we turn armed agents
of the law on citizens trying
to increase access to knowledge,

01:39:12.601 --> 01:39:17.163
we've broken the rule of law
--we've desecrated the temple of justice.

01:39:17.344 --> 01:39:19.684
Aaron Swartz was not a criminal.

01:39:21.756 --> 01:39:25.525
Change does not roll in
on the wheels of inevitability,

01:39:25.525 --> 01:39:29.084
it comes through continuous struggle.

01:39:30.316 --> 01:39:32.703
Aaron really could do magic,

01:39:32.976 --> 01:39:36.308
and I'm dedicated to making sure that
his magic doesn't end with his death.

01:39:36.308 --> 01:39:40.409
He believed that he could
change the world, and he was right.

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:44.935
Out of the last week, and out of today,
phoenixes are already rising.

01:39:46.978 --> 01:39:51.605
Since Swartz's death, Representative
Zoe Lofgren and Senator Ron Wyden

01:39:51.605 --> 01:39:55.509
have introduced legislation that would
reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act--

01:39:55.811 --> 01:40:00.563
the outdated law that formed the
majority of the charges against Swartz.

01:40:00.816 --> 01:40:03.511
It's called "Aaron's Law".

01:40:03.511 --> 01:40:07.310
Aaron believed that you literally ought
to be asking yourself all of the time:

01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:10.731
What is the most important thing I could
be working on in the world right now?

01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.203
And if you're not working
on that, why aren't you?

01:40:13.203 --> 01:40:15.758
This is what democracy looks like!

01:40:15.758 --> 01:40:17.278
We are the people too!

01:40:17.278 --> 01:40:21.088
Internet freedom's under attack, what do we do?

01:40:21.088 --> 01:40:22.814
Stand up, fight back!

01:40:22.814 --> 01:40:25.928
Internet freedom's under attack, what do we do?

01:40:25.928 --> 01:40:30.929
Hey, hey! Ho, ho! NROC has got to go!

01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:37.331
I wish we could change 
the past, but we cannot.

01:40:37.331 --> 01:40:39.898
But we can change the future and we must.

01:40:39.898 --> 01:40:44.107
We must do so for Aaron,
we must do so for ourselves.

01:40:44.107 --> 01:40:48.797
We must do so to make our world
a better place, a more humane place,

01:40:48.797 --> 01:40:54.179
a place where justice works, and access
to knowledge becomes a human right.

01:40:54.584 --> 01:41:01.741
So there was a kid, back in February,
from Baltimore, fourteen years old,

01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:08.448
who had access to JSTOR,
and he'd been spalunking
through JSTOR after reading something,

01:41:08.506 --> 01:41:14.350
and he figured out a way to do
early tests for pancreatic cancer,

01:41:14.876 --> 01:41:19.639
and pancreatic cancer kills the shit out
of you because we detect it way too late

01:41:19.639 --> 01:41:23.032
by the time we detect it, it's already
too late to do anything about it,

01:41:23.187 --> 01:41:29.080
and he sent emails off to the entire
oncology department at Johns Hopkins,

01:41:29.144 --> 01:41:32.368
you know hundreds of them, and every--
- Did you say fourteen years old?

01:41:35.379 --> 01:41:35.853
14-year-old kid, yeah, and most of them ignored
it but one of them sent him an email back,

01:41:35.853 --> 01:41:38.798
and said this is not an entirely stupid
idea, why don't you come on over?

01:41:38.798 --> 01:41:43.470
This kid worked evenings
and weekends with this researcher,
and in February I heard him on the news

01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:48.832
just a couple of weeks after Aaron died,
when Aaron was in the news a lot..

01:41:50.907 --> 01:41:53.005
Sorry...

01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:59.550
and he said the reason he was on the news 
was 'cause they'd done it. They were shipping

01:42:00.152 --> 01:42:03.941
an early test for pancreatic cancer
that was going to save lives,

01:42:03.941 --> 01:42:09.917
and he said, "This is why
what Aaron did was so important."

01:42:10.453 --> 01:42:15.359
Because you never know, right? This truth
of the universe is not only something

01:42:15.359 --> 01:42:19.581
that policymakers use to figure out,
you know, what the speed limit should be.

01:42:19.581 --> 01:42:24.390
It's where the thing that's gonna keep your kid
from dying of pancreatic cancer comes from,

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:31.391
and without access the person who might come
up with the thing that's got your number on it,

01:42:32.692 --> 01:42:34.487
may never find that answer.

01:42:36.267 --> 01:42:47.425
He sleeped so well, he didn't fall
out of, not even when he dreamed
he was back on the spacecraft.

01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:51.805
Very good, Aaron.
Very good. Yay, Aaron!

01:42:51.805 --> 01:42:56.586
Okay, now it's song time.

01:43:19.385 --> 01:43:23.983
