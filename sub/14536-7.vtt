00:03.003 --> 00:06.112
Hey! What are you
doing tomorrow?

00:06.148 --> 00:08.682
Well, it's Tuesday,
so I'm gonna be at school.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.550
What are you gonna do?

00:10.585 --> 00:12.819
I meant after school.

00:12.854 --> 00:14.580
Hey, here's an idea
off the top of my head.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.140
Not like I put
any thought into it.

00:16.175 --> 00:18.216
Why don't we play dress-up?
You can be, I don't know,

00:18.252 --> 00:20.051
a middle-aged Southern belle.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.104
( Chuckles )
I have a better idea.

00:22.139 --> 00:25.007
How about you play dress-up
as someone who gets real

00:25.042 --> 00:26.741
and tells me what
they really want.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.137
Okay, I need you to do this

00:29.171 --> 00:30.753
because I applied for
an after-school job,

00:30.789 --> 00:34.825
and I need a recommendation from
my former employer, Mrs. Dubois.

00:34.827 --> 00:38.011
The only problem is,
Mrs. Dubois does not exist.

00:38.046 --> 00:40.914
So you want me to pretend
to be your old boss,

00:40.949 --> 00:43.141
and you picked a Southern belle?

00:43.176 --> 00:45.811
It was either that
or a Russian contortionist.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.261
Your spine should
be thanking me.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.472
Come on, it is a cool job.

00:49.507 --> 00:52.167
Working at a food bank, helping
people in our community.

00:52.202 --> 00:54.544
Don't you want me
to be a better person?

00:54.579 --> 00:56.822
Of course I do.
Let me get you started off.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.448
Stop lying about
your work experience.

00:58.484 --> 01:01.393
Come on, KC, please.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.194
Okay, fine.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.113
Fine. What are we thinking?

01:05.149 --> 01:06.581
Big hair maybe. Some glasses.

01:06.617 --> 01:08.217
Whatever you think.

01:08.252 --> 01:10.085
But a parasol
wouldn't kill anybody.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.869
Actually, last time
I used a parasol

01:11.905 --> 01:13.655
on a mission... never mind.

01:13.691 --> 01:15.148
I'll do it.

01:17.002 --> 01:20.595
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:20.630 --> 01:23.749
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:23.751 --> 01:26.710
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:26.745 --> 01:31.723
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:31.759 --> 01:35.427
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:35.462 --> 01:37.520
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:37.556 --> 01:41.591
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

01:41.626 --> 01:45.528
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

01:45.564 --> 01:47.639
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

01:47.674 --> 01:49.916
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

01:49.951 --> 01:52.101
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

01:52.137 --> 01:54.254
¶ But I always got your back ¶

01:54.289 --> 01:56.098
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

01:56.133 --> 01:58.341
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

01:58.376 --> 02:01.061
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:01.096 --> 02:02.370
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:02.405 --> 02:04.773
I keep it undercover.

02:04.808 --> 02:06.408
I keep it undercover.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.124
Yeah, I think this batch
is gonna work.

02:14.159 --> 02:16.517
Bro.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.519
How many times
do I have to tell you,

02:18.555 --> 02:22.349
you cannot make yourself
a girlfriend.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.692
For your information,
I happen to be working on

02:23.727 --> 02:25.201
advancing my career.

02:25.236 --> 02:27.537
As what? A weird scientist.

02:27.572 --> 02:29.314
'Cause you're already
halfway there.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.416
Oh, clown all you want.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.236
You certainly
have the feet for it.

02:34.271 --> 02:35.711
I am trying to make
a name for myself

02:35.739 --> 02:38.373
in the Organization.

02:38.409 --> 02:39.908
Oh, really? I thought
you already had a name.

02:39.943 --> 02:41.568
Agent Nobody Else
Was Available. Ha ha!

02:41.603 --> 02:42.861
Eh.

02:44.906 --> 02:46.898
Look, this is my shot.

02:46.934 --> 02:50.685
I know I'm never gonna be
Action Hero Guy.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.600
Feel free to disagree
at any point.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.666
- Sure, you could.
- Sure, you can.

02:56.701 --> 02:58.760
Anyway, I have mad serious
science skills.

02:58.795 --> 03:00.796
And lab techs solve
just as many cases

03:00.831 --> 03:03.165
as field agents.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.080
I'm just trying
to improve myself.

03:05.110 --> 03:07.486
But if you wanna
make fun of me, go right ahead.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.696
Fine. You're so ugly

03:09.732 --> 03:12.049
that when Agent Kira
dropped you off at school,

03:12.084 --> 03:13.166
she got a ticket
for littering. Ha!

03:13.202 --> 03:15.185
Denied.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.781
You know what? Science is cool

03:19.816 --> 03:21.299
and so are you.
I'm proud of you, bro.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.993
Thank you.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.328
It feels nice to be appreciated.

03:25.363 --> 03:27.222
Plus, when I get rich
from my experiments,

03:27.257 --> 03:29.599
I'm gonna be able to buy
myself a 3-D printer.

03:29.634 --> 03:31.554
That's right, this boy's
not going to prom alone.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.633
Uh, why is that glass empty?

03:46.668 --> 03:50.971
What happened to the truth serum
I've been working on?

03:53.516 --> 03:55.366
Oh, hey, Sophie.
Good seeing you.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.162
You still smell like cat pee.

04:00.023 --> 04:02.299
Why did I just say that?

04:02.334 --> 04:03.775
I mean, it's true, but
why did I just say that?

04:03.811 --> 04:06.286
Oh, hey, what's up, guys?

04:06.321 --> 04:08.054
Way to lose that
58-point lead last night.

04:08.089 --> 04:09.529
You guys choke more
than CPR dummies.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.952
I am so sorry...

04:13.988 --> 04:15.788
that I didn't say that sooner.

04:17.199 --> 04:19.466
- Hey, KC...
- Not now, Ernie.

04:19.501 --> 04:21.442
I'm feeling really weird and I feel like
something is seriously wrong with me.

04:21.478 --> 04:25.138
We don't have time to discuss
your personality flaws right now.

04:25.173 --> 04:26.622
But let's bookmark it,

04:26.658 --> 04:29.467
because that's a conversation
I've been dying to have.

04:32.197 --> 04:33.981
But right now, here's
what you need to know.

04:33.983 --> 04:35.331
I created a truth serum,
you accidentally drank it,

04:35.367 --> 04:37.676
and it's working.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.086
Are you feeling
any side effects?

04:39.121 --> 04:43.606
Yeah, just this overwhelming
urge to strangle my brother.

04:47.587 --> 04:50.830
I don't know why they're making
us give dumb presentations

04:50.865 --> 04:52.590
about our dumb family history.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.534
And I don't know why the glue

04:54.569 --> 04:58.163
doesn't stick to
the inside of the bottle.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.990
At least this project
gives us a chance

05:00.025 --> 05:01.349
to get to know
each other better.

05:01.384 --> 05:05.111
I know everything I need to know
about the kids in our class.

05:05.146 --> 05:07.122
They're loud, smelly doofs.

05:07.157 --> 05:08.781
Present company included.

05:08.817 --> 05:10.683
You mean excluded.

05:10.718 --> 05:13.511
Do I? Do I really?

05:15.691 --> 05:17.758
Ernie, your stupid
little truth serum

05:17.793 --> 05:19.826
- is driving me nuts.
- Uh, KC.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.644
Not now, Judy.
You know what it's like

05:21.679 --> 05:23.538
to tell the truth all day?
No, you don't,

05:23.574 --> 05:25.265
because no one actually
tells the truth all day.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.058
We protect
each other's feelings.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.726
And you know what happens
when you don't?

05:28.762 --> 05:30.078
People start to develop
feelings about you,

05:30.113 --> 05:31.997
like hatred and disgust
and apparently,

05:32.032 --> 05:33.657
they don't need
your little truth serum

05:33.692 --> 05:36.809
- to share their truthful feelings.
- Uh, KC, we have company.

05:36.844 --> 05:38.778
( Distractedly ) Hi, Petey.

05:38.813 --> 05:40.805
( Sweetly ) Hi, Petey.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.099
What were you just saying
about a truth serum?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.902
Nothing...

05:45.937 --> 05:47.487
that I can say without
you finding out about

05:47.523 --> 05:48.880
our family secret.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.259
What family secret?

05:53.295 --> 05:57.613
Uh, we're competitive cloggers.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.475
Uh, we came in third
at the Mid-Atlantic Clog-Off.

06:02.253 --> 06:04.938
He's lying. We're spies.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.373
You're spies?!

06:06.408 --> 06:08.950
Don't listen to KC.

06:08.985 --> 06:11.428
She's just pulling your leg.

06:11.463 --> 06:13.755
We're just your regular,
average, normal family.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.823
And Judy's a robot.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.878
I knew something was
going on around here.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.287
The comings, the goings.

06:21.322 --> 06:26.000
That time you threw the girl's
head across the attic.

06:26.036 --> 06:27.135
And of course you're a robot.

06:27.170 --> 06:29.446
I've never seen you eat.

06:29.481 --> 06:32.065
That's because you make me
lose my appetite.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.917
Liar! Spy! Robot!

06:34.952 --> 06:39.681
Mom!!

06:39.716 --> 06:41.916
That went well.

06:41.952 --> 06:43.560
KC: No, it didn't.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.924
MARISA: KC, I need to
talk to you.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.901
KC, I...

07:00.937 --> 07:02.487
Ernie, I thought you said
KC was up here.

07:02.522 --> 07:03.522
I am.

07:08.570 --> 07:10.312
Why are you in that box?

07:10.347 --> 07:14.349
I'm hiding from you.

07:14.384 --> 07:16.059
If you wanted to hide from me,

07:16.094 --> 07:18.160
just go to the library.

07:18.196 --> 07:19.938
Now stop playing.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.982
It's time for you
to become Mrs. Dubois,

07:21.984 --> 07:23.457
and give me the recommendation
for the food bank.

07:23.493 --> 07:25.476
Okay, Marisa, look.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.912
Um, I have to
tell you something.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.490
I just want you to listen
and say okay

07:30.525 --> 07:32.016
for the sake
of our friendship, all right?

07:32.051 --> 07:33.309
Okay.

07:33.344 --> 07:35.611
Okay.

07:35.646 --> 07:36.838
I cannot give you
that recommendation today.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.548
Okay. Why?

07:39.584 --> 07:42.935
Marisa, why can't you
just say okay?

07:42.971 --> 07:45.713
KC, what's going on?

07:45.748 --> 07:47.715
Ernie gave me a truth serum,

07:47.751 --> 07:49.892
and now I am not responsible for the
words that come out of my mouth.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.386
Ooh, like last year
when I had the flu.

07:51.421 --> 07:53.738
( Makes vomiting sound )

07:53.774 --> 07:55.357
Yeah, that, um...

07:55.392 --> 07:57.659
That wasn't the flu.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.126
I actually undercooked
the brownies I made you,

07:59.162 --> 08:01.605
and gave you a mild case
of food poisoning.

08:01.607 --> 08:02.622
Well, it wasn't really mild,
because technically,

08:02.657 --> 08:04.716
you were dead for
almost a minute.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.651
See that? That's
the truth serum,

08:06.686 --> 08:08.711
and I can't control it.

08:08.746 --> 08:12.256
Okay. I'm skipping past
the "you killed me" part

08:12.291 --> 08:14.392
and going straight to relax.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.536
All you have to do
is say that I'd be

08:16.571 --> 08:17.845
the best candidate for the job.

08:17.881 --> 08:20.047
( Clears throat )

08:20.083 --> 08:23.551
Yes, that is what you
want me to say.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.755
Uh, but...

08:26.757 --> 08:29.357
Being Mrs. Dubois,
that would be untruthful, right?

08:29.392 --> 08:31.150
So I really think that
we should just postpone.

08:31.185 --> 08:33.862
But they're deciding today.

08:33.897 --> 08:34.904
If you don't go
and give me the recommendation,

08:34.940 --> 08:37.164
I won't get the job.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.960
You're not really
gonna let me down, are you?

08:42.723 --> 08:46.349
My, my, my.

08:46.384 --> 08:50.762
And a good afternoon to you,
Mr. Todd Clint, I presume.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.313
Mrs. Dubois, I presume.

08:52.349 --> 08:54.332
Well, you presume wrong.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.250
Excuse me?

08:56.286 --> 08:59.195
My friends, they call me KC.

08:59.231 --> 09:01.164
I hope you'll call me KC, too.

09:01.199 --> 09:02.479
All right?
Everybody calls me KC.

09:05.978 --> 09:08.029
Okay.

09:08.064 --> 09:09.806
Uh, Mrs. Dubois.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.040
Mm-mm-mm.

09:11.075 --> 09:14.744
KC.

09:14.779 --> 09:16.404
It says here that Marisa
worked as

09:16.439 --> 09:17.213
your part-time
personal assistant.

09:17.248 --> 09:19.932
Yes.

09:19.967 --> 09:21.942
That is what it says.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.778
Those words are on that paper.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.783
You know, Marisa,

09:28.818 --> 09:30.401
she is a lovely gal.

09:30.436 --> 09:33.204
She's vivacious, good-humored,

09:33.240 --> 09:37.075
sweeter than a sugar cake
on a baby's bottom.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.543
Well, I should go now.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.272
Here is a can of
creamed corn for y'all.

09:42.307 --> 09:43.797
Have a good day,
darlin', all right?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.483
Uh, just a few more questions.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.809
Please, since you're here.

09:46.844 --> 09:48.703
Oh, goody goody gumdrops.

09:52.266 --> 09:53.107
So how long have you
known Marisa?

09:53.143 --> 09:55.918
Since I was five.

09:55.954 --> 09:58.279
You mean, since she was five?

09:58.315 --> 10:01.632
Yes, that is true.

10:01.667 --> 10:05.761
I have known Marisa
since she was five.

10:05.797 --> 10:07.680
We used to take baths together.

10:10.434 --> 10:12.844
Can we wrap this up now?

10:12.879 --> 10:15.705
Uh, we're almost finished.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.207
Would you say that Marisa
is generally on time?

10:17.242 --> 10:18.282
Oh, yes, absolutely.

10:18.317 --> 10:19.484
She is always on time.

10:21.571 --> 10:24.881
For a party or a sale.

10:24.916 --> 10:28.409
Not for anything important when
you're really countin' on her.

10:28.445 --> 10:31.871
Well, thank you for your candor.

10:31.907 --> 10:33.465
I have just one more question.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.909
If you were me, would you hire
Marisa for this job?

10:36.944 --> 10:40.346
No, no.

10:40.381 --> 10:43.632
No, no way. Absolutely not.

10:43.668 --> 10:44.925
Negatory.<i> Nein, nicht,</i> nope.

10:44.961 --> 10:46.469
If I wasn't clear before, no.

10:46.504 --> 10:48.304
Wow.

10:48.339 --> 10:51.515
Uh, well, is there anything
else you wanna tell me?

10:51.551 --> 10:53.351
You look like a sleepy turtle.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.750
Where I come from, dear,
that's a compliment.

10:59.309 --> 11:01.192
No, it's not.

11:07.658 --> 11:09.350
Oh, hey, Sophie, looking good.

11:09.385 --> 11:11.145
And smelling even better.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.966
Hey, guys.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.459
I heard you guys killed it
on the court last night.

11:18.495 --> 11:20.586
Even though you lost 86-3,

11:20.622 --> 11:22.630
at least no one
fainted this time.

11:22.665 --> 11:23.665
Way to hydrate.

11:27.804 --> 11:29.437
I am so glad
that truth serum wore off.

11:29.472 --> 11:31.063
Feels good to lie again.

11:31.099 --> 11:32.615
KC.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.251
Hey, Marisa.

11:35.286 --> 11:38.221
I just wanna say
thank you so much

11:38.256 --> 11:39.197
for that recommendation
yesterday.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.040
Oh. Yeah, it's all good.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.967
I'm really glad it worked out,

11:43.002 --> 11:45.052
'cause I was actually
really worried

11:45.087 --> 11:46.245
that you were gonna
be upset with me.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.164
Why would I be upset?

11:48.199 --> 11:49.624
You generously took the time

11:49.659 --> 11:52.810
out of your busy day
to put on that elaborate costume

11:52.845 --> 11:55.654
and heavy makeup
to go all the way

11:55.690 --> 11:59.683
down to the food bank
and crush my dreams.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.638
So you are upset.
That makes more sense.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.957
If I wanted someone
to go down there and point out

12:05.992 --> 12:07.716
all of my flaws,

12:07.752 --> 12:10.378
I could've just sent my mother.

12:10.413 --> 12:12.822
Because of what you said,

12:12.858 --> 12:14.749
Todd thinks that I am
incapable of hard work.

12:14.784 --> 12:17.393
Marisa, I didn't say
that you couldn't work hard.

12:17.429 --> 12:20.722
I said that you
didn't work hard.

12:20.757 --> 12:22.348
Which now that I say it
out loud,

12:22.383 --> 12:23.249
is not very comforting.
I'm sorry.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.701
I really am.

12:24.736 --> 12:26.653
You know that I would never
do anything to hurt you.

12:26.688 --> 12:29.372
Yeah, I know.

12:29.407 --> 12:31.641
But in my defense, I told you,

12:31.676 --> 12:33.084
I needed to wait till
that truth serum wore off,

12:33.119 --> 12:34.260
and the good news is, it did.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.938
I'm sorry.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.923
Are you saying because
you were on truth serum,

12:38.958 --> 12:41.793
you couldn't find one
nice thing to say about me?

12:41.828 --> 12:44.395
No. No, no, no.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.839
No, I just got kinda jammed up

12:46.874 --> 12:47.514
with the way he was
asking me the questions.

12:47.550 --> 12:49.951
Yes.

12:49.986 --> 12:52.645
After all of your experience
being interrogated

12:52.680 --> 12:55.047
by international crime thugs,

12:55.083 --> 12:57.523
I'm sure Food Bank Todd
was very intimidating.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.140
He must've really raked you
across the coals, huh?

13:02.173 --> 13:05.099
Marisa, don't be like that.

13:05.135 --> 13:07.343
Please? Look, I said
I'm sorry and I meant it.

13:07.378 --> 13:08.761
Let's be real. We all know

13:08.796 --> 13:10.254
that if you would've
gotten the job,

13:10.289 --> 13:13.465
you would've just gotten bored after
five minutes and quit anyway.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.801
KC, I know some people
think that I'm

13:15.837 --> 13:17.119
just some shallow
party girl, and yes,

13:17.154 --> 13:21.983
I do like to have fun, but there
is more to me than that.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.594
I really wanted that job
with the food bank.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.604
I wanted to make a difference.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.731
Maybe my world
isn't as big as yours,

13:28.767 --> 13:30.550
but right now, it's
feeling a little too big.

13:30.585 --> 13:33.265
- Maybe you shouldn't be in it.
- ( bell rings )

13:35.465 --> 13:37.048
Uh, Marisa, just to be clear,

13:37.083 --> 13:38.441
it's maybe,
not definitely, right?

13:38.476 --> 13:40.743
Because you said maybe,

13:40.779 --> 13:43.045
but your body kinda
said definitely.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.831
Marisa, it's a maybe,
right? Marisa!

13:45.867 --> 13:48.067
I don't think it's a maybe.

13:50.980 --> 13:53.948
As you guys can see
from my family tree,

13:53.983 --> 13:54.757
both of my grandparents
were accountants.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.884
( Coughs ) Lies.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.095
And my parents
are accountants, too.

13:59.130 --> 14:02.748
( Coughs ) Lies!

14:02.783 --> 14:05.017
It's obvious,
with all these accountants

14:05.053 --> 14:06.977
that I wanna grow up to be...

14:07.013 --> 14:09.513
anything but an accountant.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.732
She's lying.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.517
They're not accountants,
they're spies.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.162
Spies? What?

14:16.197 --> 14:18.113
I don't know
what he's talking about.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.583
And this one, she's a robot.

14:20.618 --> 14:23.486
Yeah, right. I'm a robot.

14:23.521 --> 14:26.213
I'm Judy. Bee-bop, bee-bop.

14:26.248 --> 14:29.383
- Beee...
- ( laughter )

14:29.418 --> 14:31.494
It's true. She is a robot.

14:31.529 --> 14:33.395
Open your eyes, people.

14:33.431 --> 14:34.831
Have you ever seen her
eat mac and cheese?

14:34.866 --> 14:36.786
What kid doesn't like
mac and cheese?

14:38.702 --> 14:40.336
Don't listen to Petey.

14:40.371 --> 14:42.331
His family tree
grows nothing but nuts.

14:49.414 --> 14:51.530
Marisa, I need to talk to you.

14:51.565 --> 14:53.440
Well, I don't want
to talk to you.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.576
Okay, dude, come on,
we need to work this out.

14:55.611 --> 14:57.319
Can't you see that
I am on a date?

14:57.354 --> 15:01.949
Cecil and I are in the middle of
a scintillating conversation

15:01.985 --> 15:04.360
where Cecil is telling me
in 500 to 700 words

15:04.395 --> 15:06.729
about Roman mythology.

15:06.764 --> 15:08.364
You do realize that
she's just using you

15:08.399 --> 15:09.357
so that you'll do her homework.

15:09.392 --> 15:11.634
Yeah, I know.

15:11.669 --> 15:14.120
It's how I get all my dates.

15:14.155 --> 15:16.522
Gotta use what my mama gave me.

15:16.557 --> 15:18.291
Yeah, well,
did she give you feet,

15:18.326 --> 15:20.246
'cause I'm gonna need you
to use 'em.

15:24.565 --> 15:26.131
Know what, Marisa?
Enough is enough.

15:26.167 --> 15:27.708
What's that?

15:27.744 --> 15:29.260
It's Ernie's truth serum.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.696
I know that I hurt you,

15:31.731 --> 15:34.015
and I think the only way
for us to get past this

15:34.050 --> 15:36.217
is for you to just
get even, so I want you

15:36.252 --> 15:38.812
to drink this and tell me whatever
it is that's on your mind.

15:40.998 --> 15:42.390
Okay, look, I know
you're hesitant

15:42.425 --> 15:45.726
because you don't want to hurt
me as much as I hurt you...

15:45.761 --> 15:48.896
Really, I think that...
Okay. Yeah, sure.

15:48.932 --> 15:51.749
Uh, let it fly. Let me have it.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.669
You wanna know what
I really think about you?

15:54.704 --> 15:58.239
Fine. I will tell you.

15:58.274 --> 16:00.594
You make me the happiest
person on Earth.

16:03.321 --> 16:05.813
I feel joy when I see your face.

16:05.848 --> 16:08.091
When I am depressed,
all I have to do

16:08.093 --> 16:10.376
is think about you,
and it puts me in a good mood.

16:13.956 --> 16:16.665
- Okay, well...
- I am not done with you.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.867
The worst part is,

16:18.902 --> 16:21.270
you inspire me, KC Cooper.

16:21.306 --> 16:24.465
You inspire me to give back
to the world the way you do.

16:24.500 --> 16:28.827
That is why I wanted to work at
the food bank in the first place.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.087
Because I see everything
that you do,

16:30.122 --> 16:32.523
and everything that
you accomplish,

16:32.558 --> 16:35.209
and it makes me think
maybe, just maybe,

16:35.245 --> 16:36.769
I could step outside
my comfort zone

16:36.805 --> 16:39.547
and accomplish a little bit
more than I thought I could.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.874
Okay, I...

16:41.909 --> 16:44.735
I am still not done with you.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.854
I like that sweater on you.

16:46.890 --> 16:49.615
It is a nice color.

16:49.651 --> 16:52.093
It totally complements
the warm, sunny glow

16:52.128 --> 16:54.448
of your impossibly
lovely, gorgeous skin.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.368
Okay, well, I don't need
a truth serum

17:01.403 --> 17:03.129
to tell you that right now,

17:03.164 --> 17:06.540
honestly, I feel terrible.

17:06.575 --> 17:08.192
I mean, so terrible that
even Ivan the Terrible

17:08.227 --> 17:09.952
would look at me and go,

17:09.988 --> 17:12.037
"I can't with you.
You are terrible."

17:12.073 --> 17:15.349
You are, but your hair
is phenomenal.

17:15.384 --> 17:17.704
It is both bouncing
and behaving.

17:26.570 --> 17:30.814
I'm so sorry about the weird
way Petey acted at school.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.484
Making up all those stories.

17:33.519 --> 17:36.003
Who does he think he is,
Hans Christian Andersen?

17:38.441 --> 17:41.142
Why can't he just
stick his nose in his phone

17:41.177 --> 17:43.019
and play games like
all the other kids?

17:43.054 --> 17:46.530
Hey, don't feel like
you have to apologize.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.516
Also don't feel like
you have to stay.

17:48.551 --> 17:51.293
I'm in no rush.

17:51.328 --> 17:54.747
They're tenting my house
for bedbugs.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.466
Well, in that case,

17:57.502 --> 17:58.985
you look thirsty.

17:59.020 --> 18:01.578
Want some juice?

18:01.614 --> 18:03.256
Love juice.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.615
Don't mind if I do.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.554
That tastes weird.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.564
I love it.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.449
Hi, Mrs. Goldfeder.

18:14.485 --> 18:20.197
Ernie. Have I ever told you
how much I love this house,

18:20.232 --> 18:22.883
and I love the way
your mother decorated it.

18:22.919 --> 18:25.269
I mean, a table in the kitchen,

18:25.304 --> 18:27.279
and a couch in the living room.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.549
Who does that?
I love, love, love it.

18:30.585 --> 18:32.810
And I love, love, love
being your neighbor.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.237
Wow.

18:35.272 --> 18:37.289
That's an awful lot of love.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.217
( Gasps )

18:39.252 --> 18:43.070
I really gotta stop leaving
my experiments lying around.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.168
If you would just
give me a chance to...

18:49.203 --> 18:51.128
Marisa, Marisa, please.

18:51.164 --> 18:54.490
I just don't think you're the
right person for this job.

18:54.525 --> 18:55.885
Look, I have to
tell you something.

18:59.163 --> 19:01.021
I lied to you.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.724
I've never had
a real job in my life.

19:03.759 --> 19:06.477
That's why I sent
my friend down here

19:06.512 --> 19:09.054
to pretend she was
my former employer.

19:09.089 --> 19:11.816
She's not an older woman
named Mrs. Dubois.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.731
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.705
I also can't tell you
how she was able to access

19:18.741 --> 19:20.491
cutting-edge facial prosthetics

19:20.526 --> 19:22.276
and movie-studio quality makeup,

19:22.311 --> 19:25.980
so let's just skip
past that part, okay?

19:26.015 --> 19:28.799
I just... I really
wanted this job.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.067
I think what you're doing here

19:30.102 --> 19:32.528
is important work,

19:32.563 --> 19:34.288
and I wanted to be
a part of that.

19:34.323 --> 19:38.784
In fact, I would do this job
even if you didn't pay me.

19:38.819 --> 19:42.187
Oh. Why didn't you say so?

19:42.223 --> 19:45.391
There's a lot of
competition requirements

19:45.393 --> 19:47.468
for the paying position,
but anyone can volunteer.

19:47.503 --> 19:49.620
You're hired.

19:49.655 --> 19:50.980
Hey, I really have the job?

19:51.015 --> 19:53.391
Sure. You just won't get paid.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.809
I'll take it.

19:55.844 --> 19:57.964
And I promise, I will be
worth every penny.

20:10.693 --> 20:13.185
Okay, Marisa.

20:13.220 --> 20:14.545
Marisa, I am
a highly trained spy.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.221
How many times have I told you

20:16.257 --> 20:18.074
you cannot sneak up on me
like that?

20:18.109 --> 20:21.360
I don't remember
the exact number.

20:21.395 --> 20:23.555
But right now,
I don't remember my exact name.

20:31.005 --> 20:33.214
Oh, what's this?

20:33.249 --> 20:35.066
It's my "I'm sorry"
memory board.

20:35.101 --> 20:38.285
Oh, look. We're, like,
five years old in this picture.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.404
Oh, how cute.
I'm giving you a makeover.

20:40.439 --> 20:42.473
And here we are, just last week.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.016
And you were giving
me a makeover.

20:44.051 --> 20:45.976
I don't know why I bother.

20:46.011 --> 20:49.296
There's nothing anybody can do to make
your hideous face look attractive.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.348
I am hoping that
truth serum wore off.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.442
A couple hours ago.

20:53.477 --> 20:55.644
But, if you want the truth,

20:55.679 --> 20:57.029
I didn't like
what you said about me.

20:57.064 --> 21:00.357
But it wasn't 100% wrong,

21:00.392 --> 21:03.418
and I am trying to change.

21:03.453 --> 21:05.979
Which is why I went down
to the food bank,

21:06.015 --> 21:07.965
came clean, and they are
letting me be a volunteer.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.233
That's awesome.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.169
Marisa, you handled it
all by yourself.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.737
I'm really, really proud of you.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.893
You're totally
becoming responsible.

21:17.168 --> 21:18.967
So when does this new job start?

21:19.002 --> 21:21.570
A half hour ago.

21:21.606 --> 21:22.606
I gotta go!

21:25.609 --> 21:27.109
Well, it's a process.

21:30.773 --> 21:32.581
Do you know what I'm thinking?

21:32.616 --> 21:35.818
That you love, love, love
that apple?

21:35.853 --> 21:39.422
You really get me, Ernie.

21:39.424 --> 21:43.834
Believe it or not,
some people find me annoying.

21:43.870 --> 21:47.646
I'm gonna go with believe it.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.657
( Knocking on door )

21:49.692 --> 21:51.225
Hey, neighbor.
I got your message. What's up?

21:51.260 --> 21:52.626
We just bought a new juicer.

21:52.662 --> 21:55.622
- I thought you'd like to try a sample.
- Sounds tasty.

21:56.382 --> 21:59.307
Oh, Mr. Hancock.

21:59.343 --> 22:01.310
You know Mrs. Goldfeder, right?

22:01.345 --> 22:03.425
Yeah, that loud, obnoxious
windbag who...

22:08.369 --> 22:10.244
Makes my heart flutter
like a butterfly

22:10.279 --> 22:11.704
on a warm summer day.

22:11.739 --> 22:16.717
You're not too shabby
yourself, Mr. Sweet Talker.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.153
Wow. I never noticed

22:19.188 --> 22:21.814
what blue eyes you have.

22:21.849 --> 22:24.241
I could go swimming
in those pools.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.368
Well, dive on in.

22:26.403 --> 22:28.954
The water's fine.

22:28.989 --> 22:30.981
Can I interest you
in coming over

22:31.016 --> 22:31.982
for a cup of coffee?

22:32.017 --> 22:35.252
Okay. You should know,

22:35.288 --> 22:38.981
I like my coffee hot,
blonde, and full-bodied.

22:39.016 --> 22:41.016
You left out "to go."

22:45.431 --> 22:47.989
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
