00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.000 --> 01:00.500


01:17.458 --> 01:19.458


01:38.208 --> 01:40.000
Cuphead, save me!

01:40.083 --> 01:41.750
Mugman!

01:42.416 --> 01:44.833
Elder Kettle! Help!

01:51.041 --> 01:53.083
No!

01:54.875 --> 01:56.333
Remember me?

01:56.416 --> 02:00.458
Y-Yes. I think of you often,
goat from the front yard.

02:00.541 --> 02:04.166
Your soul is mine!

02:07.708 --> 02:09.791
I ain't too worried about it!

02:11.125 --> 02:14.000
-You had the dream again, didn't you?
-It's nothing.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.708
The Devil probably
has a huge operation to run.

02:16.791 --> 02:19.291
He's not worried
about little old me…

02:19.375 --> 02:20.250
That's it!

02:21.333 --> 02:22.166
Let's go!

02:23.083 --> 02:25.208
Where? It's the middle of the night!

02:25.916 --> 02:28.625
We're dealing with this Devil thing
once and for all!

02:28.708 --> 02:29.541
Come on!

02:29.625 --> 02:32.000
-This is crazy! What do we--
-Trust me.

02:32.083 --> 02:34.291
This one time, can you just trust me?

02:36.916 --> 02:37.750
Whoa!

02:42.583 --> 02:46.208
If you'd step over here, sir.
This is the Gluttony Department.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.541
Our reports have shown
an 89% increase in global overeating.

02:49.625 --> 02:52.333
Oh! How delicious!

02:52.416 --> 02:54.458
Oh! What's over there?

02:55.333 --> 02:56.458
Team Famine, sir.

02:56.541 --> 02:58.541
Not only is famine on a global upswing,

02:58.625 --> 03:01.125
but we've branched out
into hunger-induced rage.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.583
Projected numbers are through the roof!

03:03.666 --> 03:04.916
Wonderful!

03:05.000 --> 03:06.416
Did you know about this?

03:08.125 --> 03:11.166
-So this is where we do war!

03:11.250 --> 03:15.000
Three new wars are being waged
with catastrophic results on both sides.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.166
We're breaking all previous records.

03:17.250 --> 03:20.833
That is amazing!

03:20.916 --> 03:26.583
Oh, I'm impressed with how fantastically
I'm running this whole operation.

03:26.666 --> 03:31.875
In fact, I think I deserve a celebration!

03:35.250 --> 03:36.500
Attention, everyone.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.750
We're having
our most productive year in a millennia.

03:39.833 --> 03:43.208
All thanks to my hard work and dedication…

03:43.291 --> 03:44.708
What's he talking about?

03:44.791 --> 03:48.416
I don't know, but we haven't had a break
in 3,000 years, so go with it.

03:48.500 --> 03:52.125
So, let's all raise a glass to me!

03:55.166 --> 03:57.958
Um… excuse me!

04:00.083 --> 04:02.083
Oh, not this guy.

04:02.166 --> 04:04.291
Um, according to the ledger,

04:04.375 --> 04:07.791
there is one outstanding soul
in need of collection.

04:09.375 --> 04:14.666
It is a cup. He played Soul Ball.
He was on <i>Roll the Dice</i>.

04:14.750 --> 04:18.500
As of today's date,
his soul remains uncollected.

04:18.583 --> 04:20.083
Thank you, Stickler,

04:20.166 --> 04:22.250
our very diligent auditor.

04:22.333 --> 04:26.250
But I'm sure
it's just a clerical error, everyone.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.875
Doubtful. As you--

04:27.958 --> 04:30.000
Hey! Let's get that music going!

04:30.083 --> 04:32.208
-Ahem, excuse me!

04:33.541 --> 04:35.291
Excuse me!

04:36.958 --> 04:39.166
Mugman, where are you taking me?

04:39.250 --> 04:40.208
You'll see.

04:41.583 --> 04:42.958
Whoa!

04:48.708 --> 04:51.250
Is that my sour fizzy jawbreaker?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.333
Hey!

04:55.041 --> 04:58.333
Aw, man! I was working on that for months!

04:58.416 --> 04:59.583
I'm sorry, Cuphead,

04:59.666 --> 05:02.041
but I gotta make the water fizz
so he'll appear.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.291
So who will appear?

05:04.708 --> 05:10.625
<i>When in doubt, young man of mug,</i>
<i>give your brother one last hug.</i>

05:10.708 --> 05:12.541
What was that?

05:12.625 --> 05:15.958
A sage advisor, rumored to know all.

05:16.041 --> 05:20.000
-I am Quadratus, the great and wise!

05:20.083 --> 05:24.375
Come closer, young ones, so I may advise.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.666
We come seeking your wisely wisdom.

05:27.750 --> 05:32.833
Protection is your mugly goal,
for the Devil seeks his cuply soul.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.500
But fear not, for there is one way

05:35.583 --> 05:38.791
to save his soul
and keep the Devil at bay.

05:38.875 --> 05:44.291
A sweater, knit with invisible fur
from a long-extinct creature, will deter.

05:44.375 --> 05:48.291
Uh, basically, the sweater
is impenetrable to the Devil, so…

05:48.375 --> 05:50.250
Uh, you stopped rhyming.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.625
Eh. It gets old.

05:52.125 --> 05:55.375
If you're wearing it,
he cannot collect your soul.

05:55.458 --> 05:58.125
Now, where is that…? Ah-ha! Here it is!

05:58.208 --> 06:01.416
This is the last ball of invisible yarn!

06:01.500 --> 06:02.666
Take it, Mugman!

06:04.333 --> 06:07.208
And <i>you</i> must knit the sweater.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.500
Wait. Why do I gotta do all the work?

06:09.583 --> 06:14.875
The sweater is only effective
if it's made with brotherly love.

06:14.958 --> 06:18.291
Well, looks like I'm knitting
an invisible sweater, then.

06:18.375 --> 06:19.916
Gee! Thanks, Mugsy!

06:20.000 --> 06:22.416
You're the best brother
a cup could ever have!

06:22.500 --> 06:24.791
Oh, how sweet.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.500
Now get knitting!

06:29.625 --> 06:33.041
Oh! Deviled eggs!
You know, I invented these.

06:33.125 --> 06:36.250
Excuse me!

06:37.500 --> 06:39.208
There goes my appetite.

06:39.791 --> 06:41.166
Oh, games!

06:41.250 --> 06:43.250
Anyone up for a round of darts?

06:44.250 --> 06:46.416
Excuse me, please.

06:54.916 --> 06:55.791
Um…

06:57.791 --> 06:58.625
Fine!

07:00.000 --> 07:01.333
Attention, everyone.

07:01.416 --> 07:04.375
I have a teensy-weensy thing
to take care of.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.958
Don't stop the party.
I'll only be a minute.

07:10.958 --> 07:13.750
Uh, nice work, Stickler.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.916
I will not apologize for doing my job.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.500
There! All finished.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.416
Okay, Cuphead. Put it on.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.583
Urgh!

07:26.666 --> 07:28.125
Yuck! It stinks!

07:28.208 --> 07:29.541
You heard Quadratus.

07:29.625 --> 07:32.625
It's the only thing
that'll stop the Devil taking your soul.

07:32.708 --> 07:34.458
All right. I'll put it on.

07:36.833 --> 07:39.333
Oh! I guess it is nice and toasty.

07:41.833 --> 07:43.666
The Dev--

07:43.750 --> 07:46.916
Yeah. I'm here for the soul.
Let's make it snappy.

07:51.916 --> 07:53.166
Yowch!

07:53.250 --> 07:54.916
Hey, it worked!

07:55.833 --> 07:58.791
You're wearing an impenetrable,
invisible sweater!

07:58.875 --> 08:00.291
But how?!

08:00.375 --> 08:04.541
Mugman made it for me.
It works on account of our brotherly love.

08:07.291 --> 08:09.000
Of course it does.

08:09.083 --> 08:12.041
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we'll be on our way home.

08:17.666 --> 08:18.750
The Devil!

08:18.833 --> 08:21.875
-You're wearing the sweater, remember?
-Oh, right.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.125
Yeah, about that.

08:23.208 --> 08:26.083
Why don't you save us both some time
and take it off?

08:26.166 --> 08:27.458
Fat chance!

08:27.541 --> 08:29.000
Hmm. Oh!

08:30.708 --> 08:33.791
Take it off, and I'll give you ten bucks!

08:33.875 --> 08:35.583
Oh, boy! Ten bucks!

08:35.666 --> 08:38.291
No! Your soul's worth more than ten bucks.

08:38.375 --> 08:39.875
Hey, you're right!

08:40.583 --> 08:41.416
Make it 20.

08:42.333 --> 08:45.250
You're keeping that sweater on.
Now let's go home.

08:49.041 --> 08:51.791
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Step right up!

08:51.875 --> 08:53.958
See the teapot tentacle lady!

08:54.041 --> 08:57.041
Encounter the bearded flamingo!

08:57.125 --> 08:59.541
Gawk at the really big squirrel!

09:00.125 --> 09:02.208
Big squirrel?!

09:02.291 --> 09:03.916
We gotta see how big it is.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.083
Right this way, gentlemen!

09:06.166 --> 09:07.000
Wait, Cuphead.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.375
It says, "No sweaters allowed."

09:09.458 --> 09:11.250
Oh, well, off it goes.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.125
Hold it! Something's fishy about this.

09:14.208 --> 09:16.708
And I don't like the look of that carny.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.666
Come on. Let's scram.

09:26.416 --> 09:28.125
Something smells delicious!

09:29.416 --> 09:31.625
Oh, boy! Free hot dogs!

09:35.583 --> 09:37.750
Hold on, Cuphead. Look!

09:37.833 --> 09:43.250
"One bite of this free hot dog may unleash
a plague of sweater-eating demon moths."

09:43.333 --> 09:45.500
Something weird is going on!

09:47.125 --> 09:47.958
Come on!

09:53.166 --> 09:56.000
I know I said wear a sweater,

09:56.083 --> 09:59.791
but take it off, and that's much better.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.375
You're the boss.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.250
Hey! Quadratus doesn't have horns.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.291
That's the Devil in disguise!

10:06.375 --> 10:09.958
He's been trying to get your sweater off
this whole time! Let's go!

10:14.750 --> 10:17.166
Look!
We're almost out of the woods!

10:19.166 --> 10:20.458
No, you're not!

10:20.541 --> 10:22.708
Now take off that sweater!

10:22.791 --> 10:25.625
It's not happening, Devil.
Just give up already.

10:25.708 --> 10:29.916
Yeah! You should try transforming into
someone who doesn't fail all the time.

10:38.166 --> 10:39.000
Phew!

10:39.083 --> 10:40.541
So hot.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.166
Oh!

10:47.958 --> 10:51.458
I'm cooking in here.
I gotta take this thing off.

10:51.541 --> 10:53.291
No! Keep it on!

10:53.375 --> 10:55.708
I can't! I can't take it!

10:59.000 --> 11:01.833
<i>When in doubt,</i>
<i>young man of mug…</i>

11:01.916 --> 11:04.541
Give your brother one last hug!

11:06.750 --> 11:08.916
Hey! What are you doing?

11:33.125 --> 11:35.333
-We should go.
-Yeah. Let's.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.416
I hate those cups.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.875
Well, I got him!

11:50.958 --> 11:52.875
Old Scratch did it again.

11:52.958 --> 11:54.291
Where's that cake?

11:56.916 --> 11:58.500
Um…

11:58.583 --> 12:01.416
Where is the soul that has been retrieved?

12:01.500 --> 12:02.458
Hmm?

12:03.291 --> 12:06.208
I put it in the soul vault.
With the others.

12:06.291 --> 12:08.708
You mean you didn't register it?

12:09.333 --> 12:13.833
We have a tracking system in place.
Every soul must be officially accounted…

12:14.541 --> 12:15.375
for.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.291
Oops. I guess the auditor
will have to do a full recount.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.791
But I'm the auditor.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.541
Oh, that's right.
Well, don't let us keep you.

12:27.250 --> 12:28.416
Bye!

12:30.250 --> 12:32.375
Who still needs cake, huh?

12:34.125 --> 12:36.750
Finally. I can get a good night's rest.

12:36.833 --> 12:39.833
Nothing is better
than you making me a sweater.

12:39.916 --> 12:44.666
I'd make a sweater for no other
than my dearest sweet, sweet brother.

12:46.583 --> 12:49.375
Quadratus was right.
Rhyming gets old.
