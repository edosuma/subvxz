00:08.720 --> 00:11.490
I WARNED YOU NOT TO LET
YOUR CHILDREN WATCH

00:11.560 --> 00:13.090

00:15.690 --> 00:17.520
IT'S SCARIER, MORE VIOLENT

00:17.600 --> 00:20.800

Remember,
the presidential primaries

01:01.240 --> 01:03.780
are only a few months away.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.500

01:36.010 --> 01:38.550
I'M VERY, VERY PROUD
OF YOU KIDS.

01:38.610 --> 01:41.720
WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE

IT HAS THE POWER TO GRANT WISHES
TO ITS OWNER.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.450
OH, YEAH? HOW MUCH?

02:48.510 --> 02:51.010
I MUST STRONGLY ADVISE YOU,
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.540
BEHIND EVERY WISH
LURKS GRAVE MISFORTUNE.

02:53.620 --> 02:55.720
I WAS ONCE PRESIDENT OF ALGERIA.

02:55.790 --> 02:58.330
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
YOUR LIFE STORY. PAW ME.

03:00.660 --> 03:01.700

MMM!

19:24.160 --> 19:26.160
MMM! SPRIN-KLES.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.500
Geraldo Rivera

19:27.560 --> 19:30.030
Madonna, and a diseased yak.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.800
Lisa:
MOM, WHAT'S WRONG?

19:31.870 --> 19:33.500
IT'S YOUR FATHER--
HE'S MISSING.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.410
MISSING? GET OUT OF HERE.

19:35.470 --> 19:37.270
HE'S BEEN GONE FOR TWO DAYS.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.810
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

19:38.870 --> 19:40.400
SHE'S RIGHT.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.410
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE THIS WAY.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.450
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A THING OF BEAUTY

19:47.520 --> 19:49.320
NOT THIS ABOMINATION.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.380
( <i>snoring )</i>

19:51.450 --> 19:53.850
OH, SMITHERS,
I WAS WRONG TO PLAY GOD.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.860
LIFE IS PRECIOUS, NOT A THING
TO BE TOYED WITH.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.220
TAKE OUT THAT BRAIN
AND FLUSH IT DOWN THE TOILET.

20:00.290 --> 20:01.720
HIS FAMILY
MIGHT APPRECIATE IT

20:01.800 --> 20:04.030
IF YOU RETURNED THE BRAIN
TO HIS BODY.

20:04.100 --> 20:07.040
COME ON. IT'S 11:45!

20:08.070 --> 20:09.370
OH, SMITHERS

20:09.440 --> 20:12.240
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME
WITH THOSE PUPPY DOG EYES...

20:12.310 --> 20:13.210
ALL RIGHT.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.310
OW... OW...

20:17.380 --> 20:18.480
OW... OW...

20:18.550 --> 20:20.220
QUIT YOUR COMPLAINING.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.220
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

20:22.280 --> 20:23.410
HE <i>IS ALIVE.</i>

20:23.480 --> 20:24.880
OOH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
SMITHERS.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.610
I GUESS
I OWE YOU A COKE.

20:26.690 --> 20:27.960
AND AS FOR YOU

20:28.020 --> 20:29.880
YOU CLINKING, CLATTERING
CACOPHONY

20:29.960 --> 20:31.960
OF COLLAGENOUS COGS
AND CAMSHAFTS--

20:32.030 --> 20:32.860
TAKE... <i>THAT!</i>

20:35.660 --> 20:37.090
AAHH!

20:37.170 --> 20:38.170
RUN, SIR.

20:38.230 --> 20:39.390
( <i>panting )</i>

20:41.100 --> 20:43.310
EVERY BONE... SHATTERED

20:43.370 --> 20:46.310
ORGANS...
LEAKING VITAL FLUIDS

20:46.370 --> 20:49.170
A SLIGHT HEADACHE,
LOSS OF APPETITE...

20:49.240 --> 20:53.010
SMITHERS, I'M GOING TO DIE.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.020
IS THERE NOTHING I CAN DO?

20:55.080 --> 20:56.140
WELL, PERHAPS.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.160
SMITHERS,
GO TO MY OFFICE.

20:58.220 --> 21:01.330
IN THE THIRD DRAWER
OF MY DESK ARE...

21:01.390 --> 21:03.660
SURGICAL TOOLS...
AND SOME ETHER.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.390
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!

21:06.460 --> 21:07.930
DID YOU HAVE
A NIGHTMARE, HOMIE?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
NO, BART BIT ME.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.360
HEY, MAN,
YOU WERE CRUSHING ME.

21:10.430 --> 21:13.370
I TRIED TO SCREAM,
BUT MY MOUTH WAS FULL OF FLAB.

21:13.430 --> 21:15.400
GOT TO SHAKE THE DEW
OFF THE LILY.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.410
AAHH!

21:18.470 --> 21:20.900
PERHAPS YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY YOU HAVE TWO HEADS.

21:20.980 --> 21:24.080
MY BODY WAS CRUSHED,
SO I HAD MY HEAD GRAFTED ONTO

21:24.150 --> 21:26.180
A MORE, SHALL WE SAY,
AMPLE FRAME.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.350
I CAN WAKE UP.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.690
IT'S ALL A DREAM.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.020
IT'S JUST A DREAM.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.580
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

21:31.650 --> 21:33.750
IT'S ALL A DREAM...

21:35.760 --> 21:37.230
<i>NEXT WEEK ON THE SIMPSONS...</i>

21:37.290 --> 21:38.500
DON'T FORGET, DAD.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.030
TONIGHT MY CLASS IS HAVING

21:40.090 --> 21:41.920
AN ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT
SPAGHETTI DINNER.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.070
MMM.
SPAGHETTI.

21:43.130 --> 21:44.870
BUT HOMER, TONIGHT'S
OUR RECEPTION

21:44.930 --> 21:47.230
FOR QUEEN BEATRIX
OF THE NETHERLANDS.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.110
OH, I HATE
HAVING TWO HEADS.
