WEBVTT

00:09.542 --> 00:10.043
Oh, uh, get a cart.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.579
Oh, could you get it,
Niles, please?

00:12.579 --> 00:14.581
They're so small,
they make me feel

00:14.581 --> 00:17.083
like I'm some sort
of fairy tale giant.

00:23.056 --> 00:24.557
Hey, any thoughts
about what to serve?

00:24.557 --> 00:26.059
Well, I thought
we might serve

00:26.059 --> 00:27.060
a house-cured gravlax

00:27.060 --> 00:28.561
with crèème fraiche
and a sprig of dill.

00:29.095 --> 00:29.996
Oh, in other words, the usual.

00:29.996 --> 00:32.399
For your information, Niles,
people happen to like it.

00:32.399 --> 00:34.667
Yes, people like
animated musicals.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.736
Oh, honestly.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.104
Frasier, look!

00:38.104 --> 00:39.105
Caviar.

00:39.105 --> 00:41.074
They haven't had any in ages.

00:41.574 --> 00:44.110
This is just what we need
to make our soiree soign￩e.

00:44.110 --> 00:47.113
(chuckles)

00:47.113 --> 00:48.581
Good heavens.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.350
It's $100 an ounce.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.118
Well, it must be mismarked.

00:52.619 --> 00:55.588
Excuse me, is the Beluga
really $100 an ounce?

00:55.588 --> 00:57.991
(heavy French accent):
Yes.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.894
Well, isn't that
rather a lot to pay?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.328
To you, yes.

01:02.328 --> 01:05.397
To the fish who gave up
her life so you could spread

01:05.397 --> 01:06.900
her unborn children
on a cracker,

01:06.900 --> 01:08.802
it's not so much.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.171
You know, the reason

01:11.171 --> 01:13.973
for such high prices is the Russian Mafia.

01:13.973 --> 01:17.110
They control this market.

01:17.110 --> 01:21.948
The Russian Mafia controls Robert's Gourmet Goodies?

01:21.948 --> 01:24.951
He means the caviar market,
you ninny.

01:25.452 --> 01:26.319
MAN:
Yes.

01:26.319 --> 01:29.189
I have Beluga for sale.

01:29.189 --> 01:31.691
Top quality,
fair price.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.599
The name is Petyr.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.102
I recently arrived
on my cousin's ship,

01:42.102 --> 01:45.105
the Caspian Queen, with
beautiful Beluga caviar.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.608
But because of those gangsters,
we cannot sell.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.110
So I do it like this.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.111
Quietly.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.479
How much you want?

01:52.479 --> 01:54.214
How do we know this
isn't some sort of scam?

01:54.214 --> 01:57.617
It's no scam.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.487
Look inside.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.126
You taste.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.569 --> 02:19.572
You really must
try this, Niles.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.481
It's like being kissed
by a lusty mermaid.

02:28.982 --> 02:29.983
(chuckles)

02:31.918 --> 02:34.687
So, you are interested, yes?

02:34.687 --> 02:37.023
Maybe, but how can we
be sure that you are not

02:37.524 --> 02:38.525
Russian Mafia yourself?

02:38.525 --> 02:41.528
Because for six generations

02:41.528 --> 02:43.530
my family
fished the Caspian

02:43.530 --> 02:46.432
Then ten years ago, the bastards come.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.735
They burned
my father's boat.

02:48.735 --> 02:52.105
They steal my mother's salt so she cannot prepare the roe.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.408
And if they know I sell Beluga
for $40 an ounce,

02:55.408 --> 02:59.712
they would cut out my tongue
and pluck out my eyes!

03:01.714 --> 03:04.217
Did you say
$40 an ounce?

03:09.189 --> 03:10.757
Shouldn'’t our caviar
be here by now?

03:10.757 --> 03:12.258
It will be here,
Niles.

03:12.258 --> 03:13.660
I gave Roz
explicit instructions.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.562
What if we've been swindled?

03:15.562 --> 03:17.897
What if the tins
are filled with sand?

03:19.732 --> 03:20.567
Niles,

03:20.567 --> 03:22.902
I am, as you know,

03:22.902 --> 03:26.406
an excellent judge of character.

03:26.406 --> 03:32.745
And in Petyr, I saw an honest,
hard-working fisherman.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.647
Why didn't you
have him deliver it here?

03:34.647 --> 03:38.484
What? I don't want him
knowing where I live.

03:38.484 --> 03:41.854
(doorbell rings)

03:41.854 --> 03:44.724
The Russian bear
hunts by night.

03:44.724 --> 03:45.925
Very funny, Roz,
come on.

03:45.925 --> 03:46.759
Give me that.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.761
All right, let's have a look

03:51.764 --> 03:52.765
Oh.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.768
Niles.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.710
It's beautiful.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.145
I don't get what the big
deal is about caviar.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.947
I had it once,
it was nothing special.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.782
Well, Roz, a lot of things can affect caviar.

04:10.283 --> 04:11.117
Where did you have it?

04:11.117 --> 04:15.388
On a mini-bagel
at the Tucson Doubletree.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.325
Try this.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.130
Hmm.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.131
Wow.

04:25.632 --> 04:26.633
Mm-hmm?

04:26.633 --> 04:27.500
That's good.
Yes.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.868
That's really good.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.371
What's your little
party for tonight?

04:31.371 --> 04:32.372
Invited guests.

04:32.372 --> 04:33.306
I'm sorry, Roz.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.308
What?

04:35.308 --> 04:36.843
Thank you
for your help.

04:36.843 --> 04:37.877
See you later.

04:37.877 --> 04:38.811
Oh, hi, Roz.

04:38.811 --> 04:39.879
Oh, hi, Dad.

04:40.313 --> 04:41.814
Hey, hey, everybody.

04:41.814 --> 04:42.882
Check this out

04:42.882 --> 04:45.385
Just went to the ATM for $20,

04:45.385 --> 04:48.388
as you can see from this
receipt, and it gave me $60.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.823
I won 40 bucks.

04:50.823 --> 04:53.359
You, you mean
the bank lost $40.

04:53.359 --> 04:56.829
Uh, yeah, that big,
faceless bank that charges me

04:56.829 --> 04:59.699
$12 a month for my checking
account lost $40.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.669
You know,
you can't keep that.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.504
It's bad karma.

05:04.504 --> 05:05.838
Sorry, this is America.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.640
A land built on the principle
"Finders Keepers."

05:07.640 --> 05:09.509
Oh, come on.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.010
There's a toll-free
service number

05:11.010 --> 05:12.011
right here on the receipt.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.846
Just call them and tell
them what happened.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.014
Why should I?

05:15.014 --> 05:16.849
Because otherwise,
you could end up

05:16.849 --> 05:19.352
like my brother Nigel
and his baby teeth.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.434
What happened with

05:34.434 --> 05:36.703
your brother Nigel
and his baby teeth?

05:36.703 --> 05:37.704
Well, like any child,

05:37.704 --> 05:39.706
the first time he
had a tooth fall out,

05:39.706 --> 05:41.708
he put in under his pillow at bedtime,

05:41.708 --> 05:43.710
and sure enough,
the next morning,

05:43.710 --> 05:46.546
he found that Winston Churchill
had left him a shiny, new coin.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.647
Question.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.115
No, Dad, we're not stopping

05:49.115 --> 05:50.983
Go ahead,
darling.

05:50.983 --> 05:52.418
Well, instead of being grateful,

05:52.885 --> 05:54.420
he got greedy
and went off to school,

05:54.420 --> 05:55.888
punching people
in their mouths

05:55.888 --> 05:57.256
and scooping up their teeth.

05:58.991 --> 06:02.362
Of course, it didn't work, and he got kicked out of school,

06:02.862 --> 06:05.298
became a thief,
and eventually went to prison.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.104
Where he...

06:11.104 --> 06:14.974
fittingly had all
of his teeth knocked out.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.876
No, he lost his teeth
years earlier

06:16.876 --> 06:18.244
in a rock-eating contest.

06:20.079 --> 06:21.581
Now that's an interesting story.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.083
We were renting a house
next to a quarry at the time...

06:24.083 --> 06:27.086
All right, all right, I'll call the bank!

06:28.087 --> 06:30.590
Very kind of you
to have us here, Crane.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.591
Yes, it's wonderful.

06:31.591 --> 06:35.027
But then you must be used to
hosting successful parties.

06:35.027 --> 06:36.429
Oh, not really.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.732
Something's usually
on fire by now.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.367
Oh, you're funny.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.536
No, I'm serious.

06:43.536 --> 06:44.937
Now, tell me.

06:44.937 --> 06:47.940
How can we get our hands on some
of this fantastic caviar?

06:48.441 --> 06:49.942
Well, I wish
I could tell you,

06:49.942 --> 06:50.877
but it's, uh

06:50.877 --> 06:53.146
a private source.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.981
Well, perhaps I should
mention then,

06:55.481 --> 06:57.483
that, uh, this is
for our yacht party,

06:57.483 --> 07:00.787
at which there just might be
room enough for another guest.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.955
Okay, what are we talking here?

07:02.955 --> 07:06.592
Well, maybe five, six ounces?

07:06.592 --> 07:09.228
Let me go see
what's in the refrigerator

07:09.228 --> 07:11.330
That a boy, Crane.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.134
Niles, what are you doing?

07:15.134 --> 07:16.169
Oh, good news.

07:16.669 --> 07:19.005
Emile Sinclair
is crazy about the caviar.

07:19.005 --> 07:21.374
If we sell him the rest,
he distinctly implied

07:21.374 --> 07:23.876
he would get our squash lockers
moved further from the showers.

07:23.876 --> 07:26.212
Isn't that fantastic?

07:26.212 --> 07:27.547
Per-son-al.

07:27.547 --> 07:29.048
It's, well, it would be, Niles

07:29.048 --> 07:32.051
if the Michaelses weren't
equally enamored of it,

07:32.051 --> 07:34.420
and dangling an invitation
to a yacht party.

07:34.420 --> 07:37.824
That is a pickle.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.759
Check-ing.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.661
FRASIER:
Niles?

07:41.661 --> 07:44.664
Why don't we just call Petyr,
and order some more caviar?

07:44.664 --> 07:47.533
That way we can satisfy both
Sinclair and the Michaels.

07:47.533 --> 07:52.171
Cus-to-mer
Ser-vice.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.141
Niles, this caviar connection

07:55.641 --> 07:57.410
could really open
some doors for us.

07:59.045 --> 08:03.382
Per-son-al!

08:03.382 --> 08:04.417
What are you doing, Dad?

08:04.917 --> 08:06.419
Oh, this stupid bank's
automatic voice system,

08:06.419 --> 08:07.887
it's like a maze!

08:07.887 --> 08:09.422
All right,
give it here.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.924
You just push "O"

08:11.924 --> 08:13.926
and you'll get
an operator.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.829
It's a little trick
I learned.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.731
Another menu.

08:18.731 --> 08:21.734
Sometimes it's a star.

08:24.237 --> 08:28.741
All right, maybe "1"
will get me back to a main menu.

08:28.741 --> 08:29.709
Ah.

08:29.709 --> 08:30.743
Here you are.

08:30.743 --> 08:32.245
Got me to
the right department?

08:32.245 --> 08:34.746
No, but if I remember my
high school Spanish correctly,

08:35.248 --> 08:37.250
you just qualified
for a small business loan.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.188
Hi, can I help you?

08:42.188 --> 08:44.222
Yes, um, I was at one
of your ATMs yesterday,

08:44.724 --> 08:47.260
and it gave me back more than it
should have, so I want...

08:47.260 --> 08:48.761
Okay, for that you'’re
going to need to complete

08:49.262 --> 08:50.763
an ATM trouble report,
and then take it

08:50.763 --> 08:52.732
to our operations officer
at the desk over there.

08:52.732 --> 08:56.002
You mean I have to fill this out
before I can give you 40 bucks?

08:56.002 --> 08:57.169
Yes, sir.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.305
But your sign says,
"Making banking simpler."

08:59.305 --> 09:00.072
Yes, sir.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.541
Well, this isn't simpler

09:01.541 --> 09:02.875
it's more complicated.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.144
Yes, sir, it is.

09:05.144 --> 09:08.581
Oh, forget it.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.853
I knew this was going to be more
trouble than it was worth.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.155
A little paperwork's
a small price to pay

09:16.155 --> 09:17.156
for a clear conscience.

09:17.657 --> 09:18.658
Yeah, meanwhil
e, I'm out 40 bucks.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.660
It's not your money.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.764
Can I help you?

09:24.764 --> 09:27.600
Yes, uh, I had some trouble
with one of your ATMs.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.602
Oh, I can't help you.

09:29.602 --> 09:32.104
I need a manager.

09:32.104 --> 09:33.606
I'm proud of you.

09:33.606 --> 09:36.375
Trust me, when this is over,
you'll feel better.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.177
You really think so?

09:38.177 --> 09:39.178
I'm sure of it.

09:39.178 --> 09:40.680
Ah, maybe you're right.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.181
Maybe I will feel better.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.183
And if you're right
about that karma stuff

09:44.183 --> 09:46.686
I got a good thing coming to me.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.187
Uh-oh.

09:48.187 --> 09:51.190
How much money did you
put in the meter?

09:51.190 --> 09:55.061
Oh, son of a bitch

09:55.061 --> 09:57.930
Hi, Mr. Crane, I'm Bree, Todd's manager.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.934
I wanted t apologize for
the trouble you had with our ATM.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.437
And make sure that you got your $40

10:04.437 --> 10:05.938
What? Uh, oh, no, no,

10:05.938 --> 10:08.341
you don't need
to give anything to me.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.710
You see, the machine
accidentally gave me $60

10:10.710 --> 10:12.678
instead of $20, so I need
to give you $40.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.547
So, you want to
put this in your account?

10:14.547 --> 10:15.481
No, no, no.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.984
I want you to take it,
plus this $40,

10:17.984 --> 10:20.820
and put it back
wherever it came from.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.155
Well, I'm afraid I've already done the paperwork.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.657
Now you'll have to speak
with our branch manager,

10:25.157 --> 10:26.025
but he's out of town.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.361
This is ridiculous.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.795
I'm sorry.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.797
Although, there is
one other possibility.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.165
Let me try something.

10:33.165 --> 10:34.500
Thank you.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.836
Don'’’t mention it.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.672
Per-son-al

10:43.676 --> 10:46.178
Sandoval, four ounces.
Right.

10:46.679 --> 10:49.148
Smoot, five ounces.
Right.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.083
McBean, ten ounces.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.051
Ten?

10:52.051 --> 10:53.552
Yes, I know it's a lot,

10:53.552 --> 10:55.554
but he promised me the use
of his Sonoma estate.

10:55.554 --> 10:56.522
Yes, well,
for ten, he should

10:56.522 --> 10:58.491
You know, for eight,
the Ashworths gave me

10:58.491 --> 11:00.426
the use of their box at
the opera's opening night gala

11:00.426 --> 11:02.828
But that's the same weeken
d as the Black and White ball.

11:02.828 --> 11:03.763
When are we going to sleep?

11:03.763 --> 11:05.197
Good Heavens.

11:05.698 --> 11:10.169
Sleep is for people without social lives.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.103
(laughs)

11:11.604 --> 11:14.407
So, boys,
where's my cut?

11:14.407 --> 11:15.675
Oh, what are you talking about?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.510
I promised her a cut.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.378
You see, I was so busy
at work taking orders

11:19.378 --> 11:20.346
that I needed her help.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.181
ROZ:
You know what
it's really good on?

11:22.181 --> 11:23.549
Scrambled eggs.

11:23.549 --> 11:24.550
And pizza.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.052
And potato skins...

11:26.052 --> 11:27.520
Yes, Roz, welcome to caviar.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.489
At work, during the show,
I'm just sitting there thinking

11:30.489 --> 11:32.458
"Two hours to caviar."

11:32.958 --> 11:34.460
"One hour to caviar."

11:34.460 --> 11:37.763
You don't have any on you, do you?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.032
Uh, no, no.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.300
We're expecting
some momentarily.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.568
Cool.

11:44.570 --> 11:47.073
You think it'd be good
on a cheese Danish?

11:47.573 --> 11:48.574
I think it would.

11:48.574 --> 11:49.575
I'm getting one.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.380
Gentlemen.
Oh, Petyr, hello.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.882
Yes, hello,
but I am afraid also good-bye.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.385
Hmm? What?
What do you
mean good-bye?

11:59.385 --> 12:00.886
All these orders
I fill for you.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.221
It draws too much attention.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.556
It's too risky for me.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.824
What are you saying?

12:04.824 --> 12:06.459
That, that there's no more caviar?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.360
This is my last delivery.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.096
But this isn't
nearly enough.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.964
We've made commitments
to some very powerful people.

12:11.964 --> 12:14.300
If we disappoint them, there's no telling what they might do.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.134
They will break legs?

12:15.634 --> 12:16.469
Cut off thumbs?

12:16.469 --> 12:18.170
Worse, there'll be gossip.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.507
Petyr, please,
just one more delivery.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.442
I cannot, the danger
is too great.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.344
Petyr!

12:27.847 --> 12:29.348
Dear God.

12:29.348 --> 12:30.850
We're ruined, Niles.

12:30.850 --> 12:31.851
We owe people all over town.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.152
I know.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.954
Is some of that mine? Can I have it now?

12:34.954 --> 12:36.422
Roz, Roz,
I'm terribly sorry.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.858
It seems our supplier
is going out of business,

12:39.358 --> 12:41.227
and every ounce
of this is spoken for.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.028
Well, that's too bad.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.430
Oh, well, whatever

12:44.430 --> 12:45.931
I was thinking
of giving it up anyway

12:45.931 --> 12:46.932
Too much salt.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.933
Yes, good girl.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.301
All right, Niles,
we can't panic.

12:49.301 --> 12:50.636
I think I
have a plan.

12:50.636 --> 12:51.637
I like it.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.140
We may have to
bite the bullet

12:54.640 --> 12:55.574
and buy retail

12:55.574 --> 12:57.476
Petyr's stuff
is much better quality.

12:57.476 --> 12:58.944
Our friends will
notice the difference.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.946
Not if we cut it with what's left of the good stuff.

13:00.946 --> 13:01.947
How much is there?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.949
There's... Roz!

13:04.450 --> 13:06.452
Oh, dear God!

13:09.588 --> 13:11.123
This is going
to cost us a fortune.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.658
What else can we do?

13:12.658 --> 13:14.160
Uh, excuse me.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.662
Would you happen to know
where we can get...

13:17.163 --> 13:20.166
five pounds
of Beluga caviar?

13:20.166 --> 13:23.669
There'’s not that much Beluga in all of Seattle.

13:23.669 --> 13:24.670
Thank you.

13:24.670 --> 13:27.173
What are we
going to do?

13:27.173 --> 13:29.175
All right, just give me a chance to think, Niles.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.676
Ah...

13:32.678 --> 13:35.014
What was the name of the boat--

13:35.014 --> 13:36.849
H.M.S.Bounty.

13:42.354 --> 13:43.856
This isn't Trivial Pursuit!

13:44.356 --> 13:45.157
Let me finish!

13:48.027 --> 13:50.429
What was the n
ame of the boat

13:50.429 --> 13:52.765
that Petyr
said he sailed on?

13:52.765 --> 13:54.166
Caspian Queen.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.635
Niles,

13:56.635 --> 13:58.571
if we can find that boat,

13:58.571 --> 14:02.575
perhaps we can get enough
caviar to solve our problem.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.179
Roz.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.115
Hey, what are
you guys doing here?

14:10.115 --> 14:13.619
I think the question is,
what are you doing here?

14:14.119 --> 14:16.055
You know, shopping...
for stuff.

14:16.555 --> 14:19.558
u?
You're looking for
more caviar, aren't yo

14:19.558 --> 14:22.061
Of course, I am,
you took all mine!

14:22.061 --> 14:23.829
That was ours!

14:23.829 --> 14:26.432
You know, Roz, I think
you may have a little problem.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.800
You're the one
with the problem.

14:28.300 --> 14:28.801
Not me.

14:29.301 --> 14:30.302
This is all
your fault.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.303
You made me try it.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.304
Now I crave it!

14:32.304 --> 14:33.606
I really hate you!

14:35.941 --> 14:36.408
Now, Roz...

14:36.942 --> 14:39.945
you know you don'’’t mean that

14:39.945 --> 14:41.413
Now, come on.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.915
Listen, it's just possible

14:42.915 --> 14:46.418
that we may be able to get
some more from our old supplier.

14:46.919 --> 14:47.419
Is that true?
Yes.

14:47.920 --> 14:48.420
Is he right?

14:48.921 --> 14:49.922
I'm sorry I said
I hate you.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.424
Roz, Roz, it's all right.
Are you going to get it today?

14:52.925 --> 14:53.926
I love you!

15:00.432 --> 15:01.433
(phone ringing)

15:01.433 --> 15:02.701
Oh, shoot.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.937
(doorbell chimes)

15:04.937 --> 15:05.905
(phone ringing)

15:09.341 --> 15:10.342
Hello.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.778
Ah, no, I'm sorry,
Frasier isn't here.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.347
Sure, you can place an order.

15:15.781 --> 15:19.351
Yes, let me transfer you
to that department.

15:22.354 --> 15:23.355
Hi, Daph. Hello.

15:23.355 --> 15:25.257
The postman gave me
your mail.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.258
Oh, thanks.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.760
You ready
to get stretched?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.162
Oh, you mean we're
working out today?

15:30.162 --> 15:31.497
We work out every day.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.499
Yeah, yeah, I know.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.501
Oh, postcard from the bank.

15:35.501 --> 15:38.971
Uh, "Dear Mr. Crane, we
apologize for the inconvenience.

15:38.971 --> 15:42.474
"We have evaluated your request

15:42.474 --> 15:45.811
and credited your account $80"!

15:50.783 --> 15:51.850
There's no spaces.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.319
I parked your car
in a loading zone.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.287
No, no, no, just pull around front and wait for me.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.188
This won't take long.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.489
You're sure?
Yes.

15:57.489 --> 15:58.824
And you better
get back to the car

15:58.824 --> 15:59.792
before Eddie
starts to panic.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.229
Hi, how can I help you
make banking simpler?

16:04.663 --> 16:06.632
I'll tell you how you can help me.

16:06.999 --> 16:09.068
I'm going to talk
and you're going to listen,

16:09.068 --> 16:10.903
and you're going to do exactly as I ask.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.672
I think I should
go get a manager.

16:14.006 --> 16:14.506
No, no managers.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.308
But our policy is...

16:16.642 --> 16:18.711
Now this is real simple,
and I know you can handle it.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.179
Now what I want you to do is--

16:20.179 --> 16:22.214
GUARD:
Hold it right there, Mister!

16:27.619 --> 16:30.489
Mr. Crane, as the president of
the bank, I want to assure you

16:30.689 --> 16:32.157
that it is not our policy

16:32.524 --> 16:35.494
to draw firearms on customers
trying to make a deposit.

16:36.395 --> 16:40.666
It wasn't a deposit.

16:41.934 --> 16:46.438
Now, I'm sure that neither of us wants to turn this

16:46.438 --> 16:48.340
into a protracted legal battle,

16:48.340 --> 16:52.044
so if you would simply sign this non-disclosure agreement

16:52.044 --> 16:56.215
here, here, here..

16:56.215 --> 16:57.716
and here.

16:57.716 --> 17:01.720
Our attorneys have authorized me
to compensate you

17:01.720 --> 17:05.124
for your troubles
in the amount of $10,000,

17:05.124 --> 17:08.027
which can be credited to your account.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.396
Ten grand?

17:11.696 --> 17:14.566
Plus, the $40
from our original mistake.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.038
Oh, what the hell.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.507
I just want
to get it over with.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.409
That's wonderful.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.145
Now, is there anything else I can do for you?

17:26.412 --> 17:29.481
Could I open
an account?

17:35.487 --> 17:36.989
FRASIER:
Ahoy!

17:39.491 --> 17:42.995
Ahoy!

17:42.995 --> 17:45.931
Is anyone here?

17:45.931 --> 17:47.766
Oh, hello.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.769
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

17:50.769 --> 17:54.239
And, uh, this
is my brother,

17:54.239 --> 17:55.741
Dr. Niles Crane.

17:57.509 --> 18:00.179
We're interested in
purchasing some Beluga caviar.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.415
This is not a shop.
I have nothing for sale.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.249
See?
Let's go.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.717
No, no, no,
Niles, Niles...

18:06.118 --> 18:08.187
This is how
the game is played.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.689
Maybe he thinks
we're Russian Mafia.

18:10.689 --> 18:11.657
Oh, yes.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.594
People make that mistake
about us all the time.

18:17.496 --> 18:20.499
Petyr gave us
this card,

18:20.499 --> 18:22.801
and told us that this
was his cousin's boat.

18:22.801 --> 18:25.704
Are you sure
you can't help us?

18:25.704 --> 18:28.107
(speaking Russian)

18:29.608 --> 18:33.512
(laughing)

18:33.512 --> 18:35.481
How much do you need?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.383
Five pounds.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.220
(speaking Russian)

18:46.158 --> 18:47.659
$80 an ounce.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.662
Well, we were paying $40.

18:50.662 --> 18:52.498
And now you pay $80.

18:52.798 --> 18:53.765
$50.

18:53.765 --> 18:54.666
$80.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.034
$60.
$80.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.637
I don't think you're
doing this right.

18:59.905 --> 19:00.906
$70, that's my
final offer.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.407
$80.
Done!

19:05.410 --> 19:07.412
I want to taste it first.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.352
Go ahead.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.195
That's the stuff.

19:23.195 --> 19:25.030
That's enough to take
care of everyone

19:25.030 --> 19:26.031
and still go out on top!

19:26.532 --> 19:28.033
Yes, all right,
here's your money.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.535
Pleasure doing
business with you.

19:29.535 --> 19:32.037
MAN (over PA):
Stop where you are!
U.S. Customs!

19:32.037 --> 19:33.038
U.S. Customs!

19:33.038 --> 19:34.039
U.S. Customs.
Oh, my God!

19:34.039 --> 19:35.541
Frasier, we have to get rid ofit.

19:35.541 --> 19:36.542
Oh, dear God!

19:36.542 --> 19:37.409
Oh, dear God!

19:37.409 --> 19:38.377
Oh, dear God!
Oh, dear God!

19:38.844 --> 19:40.212
All right, all right,
we have to hide it!

19:40.546 --> 19:41.613
No, Niles, you can't hide it!

19:41.613 --> 19:43.549
They're U.S. Customs!
That's what they do!

19:43.549 --> 19:45.117
They find things on ships!

19:46.618 --> 19:47.953
I know one way
to get rid of it.

19:55.694 --> 19:59.064
Can I get you
a toast point?

19:59.064 --> 20:00.899
Oh, here, for God's sakes!

20:09.741 --> 20:11.510
What the hell's
all this?

20:14.279 --> 20:17.583
It's not ours, we found it.

20:17.816 --> 20:18.884
What, the caviar?

20:18.884 --> 20:21.253
Is that what this is?

20:21.587 --> 20:22.654
Relax, we don't care about that.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.656
We're looking for
a couple of Russians

20:24.656 --> 20:26.024
who've been smuggling DVDs

20:34.666 --> 20:36.168
My heart is pounding.

20:36.668 --> 20:40.138
I was afraid we were
going to get arrested.

20:40.138 --> 20:42.074
What have we become?

20:42.074 --> 20:43.375
I don't know.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.678
We got caught up
in a nefarious scheme.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.180
And for what?

20:48.180 --> 20:51.116
A visit to
a wine country estate?

20:51.450 --> 20:53.819
A box at the opera?

20:53.819 --> 20:55.587
Dinner at
the Governor's Mansion?

20:58.824 --> 21:00.359
How much of this do you
think we can salvage?

21:00.792 --> 21:02.361
I don't know,
just start scraping.
