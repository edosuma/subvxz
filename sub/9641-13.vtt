WEBVTT

00:02.166 --> 00:04.375
Where's your Uncle Kelbo?

00:04.375 --> 00:07.166
Your father and I
are going to miss our train.

00:07.166 --> 00:08.875
Just go on your trip.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.250
What's the worst that
could happen

00:10.250 --> 00:12.000
if we're not chaperoned
for four minutes?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.958
Oh, I don't know. A magic
black hole could open up

00:14.958 --> 00:17.208
and suck the Sub Station
down into it.

00:17.208 --> 00:20.458
That doesn't
happen twice, Mother.

00:21.875 --> 00:24.375
But if it did,
you wouldn't be mad

00:24.375 --> 00:27.208
if I had an egg battle
when you're gone, right?

00:30.250 --> 00:33.500
OK, what I don't understand is
how you think leaving us with
Uncle Kelbo

00:33.500 --> 00:35.375
is any better than
leaving us alone.

00:35.375 --> 00:38.458
Or with Max in charge.

00:38.458 --> 00:41.708
I'm in charge?
Egg battle on.

00:42.958 --> 00:44.583
OK, OK.

00:44.583 --> 00:46.958
Kelbo's on his way.
Let's get out of here.

00:46.958 --> 00:49.750
We are going to have
the most romantic

00:49.750 --> 00:53.416
vacation slash restaurant supply
convention ever!

00:53.416 --> 00:57.000
Yeah, nothing says romance
like a seminar on how to
prevent mustard bottles

00:57.000 --> 00:59.416
from making that
farting sound.

01:03.708 --> 01:06.083
Well, look at that.

01:06.083 --> 01:09.000
Five seconds later,
we're all still alive.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.958
Now let me get back
to my chores.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.875
While you do nothing, as usual,

01:15.875 --> 01:18.583
I'll be getting things ready
for the shindig I'm hosting.

01:19.833 --> 01:21.291
"Shindig?"

01:21.291 --> 01:24.583
In a continuing effort to have
the full senior year experience,

01:24.583 --> 01:29.125
I'm going to dabble in a bit
of rebellion by hosting a mixer

01:29.125 --> 01:31.291
while Mom and Dad
are out of town.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.458
- A "mixer?"
- Uh-huh.

01:34.458 --> 01:39.625
Is that something less lame than
calling it a "boy/girl party?"

01:39.625 --> 01:41.625
As if you've ever been to one.

01:41.625 --> 01:43.000
Hey...

01:44.708 --> 01:46.750
...I've been to lots of
boy/girl parties.

01:46.750 --> 01:49.958
Oh, OK. Having Zeke over
and me and Harper walk through

01:49.958 --> 01:52.166
is not a boy/girl party.

02:00.875 --> 02:02.083
Hello?

02:05.875 --> 02:08.333
Excuse me, could you
give me a hand?

02:08.333 --> 02:10.833
- Shakira?
- Yeah.

02:10.833 --> 02:15.000
I'm on tour with the Harlem
Globetrotters and our tour bus
broke down.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.833
And the only way to fix it
is singing a duet with a fan.
Are you a fan?

02:18.833 --> 02:22.333
- Yeah, no, we're huge fans!
- Really?

02:22.333 --> 02:25.625
You came at a bad time,
though, 'cause I'm crazy busy
with an egg battle.

02:27.583 --> 02:29.250
Well, I guess then
it's up to you

02:29.250 --> 02:32.875
because if I don't sing a duet,
I'm never gonna get
that bus fixed.

04:53.875 --> 04:57.583
The best thing about being
International Pop Star Shakira

04:57.583 --> 05:01.166
is that I get to live
the double life of an
international pop star

05:01.166 --> 05:06.458
and the weird, freaky,
weird life of myself.

05:06.458 --> 05:10.750
That's right, I said "weird"
twice, to emphasize "freaky."

05:13.583 --> 05:15.375
But won't Shakira be upset

05:15.375 --> 05:17.375
to find out you've been
impersonating her?

05:17.375 --> 05:19.208
You wanna hear a secret?

05:23.166 --> 05:25.000
There is no Shakira!

05:26.375 --> 05:29.416
I made her up years ago!

05:29.416 --> 05:32.708
Take that, world.

05:32.708 --> 05:36.875
Wow, wait...
So, Shakira's really you?

05:36.875 --> 05:41.500
- Mm-hm.
- Do you know how many boys
have been kissing your poster?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.458
One of them's your brother.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.333
I do have a problem though
because I keep on

05:49.333 --> 05:52.333
transforming into Shakira
at the oddest times.

05:52.333 --> 05:56.708
Last week I was at Curved Lines,
the wizard gym for men,

05:56.708 --> 06:01.375
and, um, before I knew it,
I was Shakira,

06:01.375 --> 06:04.875
I had a lot of explaining to do
in the sauna that day.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.875
Let me guess,
you panicked and flashed out.

06:08.875 --> 06:12.750
- You really get me.
- Yeah.

06:12.750 --> 06:16.958
Look, if I get busted
I'm in big trouble.

06:16.958 --> 06:22.000
There's a strict law about using
magic for fame and fortune.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.458
It's one of the main
11 wizard rules.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.333
Hold on,
there are 11 wizard rules?

06:26.333 --> 06:28.000
My dad said there was just one:

06:28.000 --> 06:30.750
"What your mother doesn't know
won't hurt her."

06:31.708 --> 06:33.583
Alex, I so need your help.

06:33.583 --> 06:37.250
I mean, who does a rule breaker
turn to in a time of need?

06:37.250 --> 06:39.208
Another rule breaker.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.125
OK, I'm on it. All right.

06:41.125 --> 06:44.125
Now, first things first.
We cannot tell Justin.

06:44.125 --> 06:46.458
He'll just report you
to the Wizard Council.

06:46.458 --> 06:50.458
Second things second, don't tell
me, 'cause I'm probably gonna
forget and tell Justin.

06:51.291 --> 06:52.625
OK, we won't tell you.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.500
Tell me what?

06:54.500 --> 06:56.166
You're good.

06:59.625 --> 07:03.333
Invites to my mixer.
Right here. Mixer.

07:03.333 --> 07:07.000
Huh? Huh? Huh?

07:07.000 --> 07:10.750
It's gonna be great,
there'll be people mingling
and... and mixing,

07:10.750 --> 07:13.708
there'll be a sparkling
fruit beverage.

07:13.708 --> 07:16.875
That's just fancy talk
for punch, Russo.

07:16.875 --> 07:17.875
Are there gonna be chicks?

07:18.875 --> 07:20.291
Are there gonna be chicks?

07:20.291 --> 07:25.250
My friend, it's not called
a "boy/girl party" for nothing.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.333
"Boy/girl party?"
What, are you nine?

07:29.416 --> 07:33.333
What I meant was "bubble party."

07:33.333 --> 07:34.458
MacGruder out.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.125
Hate to burst your bubble...
party.

07:41.708 --> 07:44.083
Boop, boop, boop, boop,
beep, beep, beep...

07:44.083 --> 07:47.208
boop, beep, boop, boop...

07:50.500 --> 07:54.458
Whoa. Is that Shakira?
MacGruder back in.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.458
- Shakira?
- No, no, no...

07:56.458 --> 07:58.750
Justin. It's not actually...

07:58.750 --> 08:02.458
Um... Shakira's bus broke down.

08:02.458 --> 08:05.333
- Shakira.
- Apparently he's only
capable of saying...

08:05.333 --> 08:06.416
Shakira.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.083
- Shakira!
- See.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.375
I'll come to your party if
Shakira's going to be there.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.750
Good question. Shakira?

08:13.750 --> 08:15.625
I'd love to come to your party.
I love my fans.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.416
Especially those who
say my name over and over.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.750
- Shakira, Shakira, Shakira...
- No, no, no! No, um...

08:22.750 --> 08:25.458
No. Shakira cannot come to
your party. Right, Shakira?

08:25.458 --> 08:27.708
Oh, no, no. I'm coming.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.875
Yeah, Uncle Kelbo loves parties.

08:34.458 --> 08:38.458
Oh look, another random comment
from Max.

08:38.458 --> 08:41.250
Now I know what you
guys are always talking about.

08:43.208 --> 08:47.166
Shakira's coming to my mixer!
I've got to tell everyone.

08:49.208 --> 08:52.416
Everybody,
Shakira's coming to my party!

08:54.291 --> 08:57.416
Well that was
the worst possible thing
you could've done.

08:57.416 --> 08:58.958
Until we find out
what's causing this,

08:58.958 --> 09:00.500
you can't show up
at a party.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.708
You might pop back and forth
between Shakira and Kelbo

09:02.708 --> 09:03.708
in front of everyone.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.333
Like that!

09:08.625 --> 09:11.166
OK, I'm sorry,
I've spent a long time

09:11.166 --> 09:13.000
creating a reputation
for Shakira

09:13.000 --> 09:15.500
as someone
who cares about her fans,

09:15.500 --> 09:18.083
and I'm not gonna
let them down now.

09:18.083 --> 09:20.583
She's gonna
teach me how to dance!

09:30.500 --> 09:34.750
OK. Let's see...
"uncontrollable transformations.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.333
See page 685."

09:38.583 --> 09:41.625
OK. "See page 532."

09:43.083 --> 09:46.000
OK. "Stop flipping and call
a doctor." What?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.958
I found something!

09:47.958 --> 09:50.458
- Wow! Wow!
- Great.

09:50.458 --> 09:54.583
The tallest mountain
in the wizard world

09:54.583 --> 09:58.875
contains the world's largest
dwarf mine.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.083
Great. We just solved
his problem.

10:01.083 --> 10:05.458
What? Uh...
That's a wizard trivia book.
We didn't solve anything.

10:05.458 --> 10:06.708
We didn't?

10:06.708 --> 10:09.875
No. I still feel
kinda weird.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.458
My eyes are all watery and itchy

10:12.458 --> 10:15.833
and I still feel like gyrating
in form-fitting Lycra.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.958
All right, look. I think
we should just go to Justin.

10:21.958 --> 10:24.875
If he tells the Wizard Council,
so be it,

10:24.875 --> 10:27.375
I'll just have to face
my magical punishment.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.875
And what's that?

10:28.875 --> 10:31.250
Well, they remove your ability
to hold a wand

10:31.250 --> 10:33.708
by breaking
both of your hands.

10:33.708 --> 10:35.416
Well, what's magical
about that?

10:35.416 --> 10:37.250
A dragon does it.

10:43.958 --> 10:48.375
Oh, Uncle Kelbo, is this the
transformation spell you used
to become Shakira?

10:48.375 --> 10:52.333
"When you're tired of the same
old story, turn some pages...

10:52.333 --> 10:53.833
Trash can."

10:59.583 --> 11:01.000
What are you guys
staring at?

11:02.083 --> 11:03.875
Max, you're a trash can.

11:03.875 --> 11:07.166
And you're a terrible
older sister.

11:07.166 --> 11:11.250
No, dude,
you really turned yourself
into a rusty trash can.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.583
Ow!

11:12.583 --> 11:15.416
What? Oh, this is awesome!

11:15.416 --> 11:18.875
Every two minutes something
gross and exciting will be
thrown in me.

11:18.875 --> 11:20.833
Hopefully rotten eggs
for my egg battle.

11:25.958 --> 11:28.583
Aw, man. It wore off already.

11:29.833 --> 11:32.708
Wait. Max. You didn't do
a spell to change back?

11:32.708 --> 11:35.708
Why would I?
I was living the dream.

11:35.708 --> 11:40.250
Why? Because Kelbo can't control
his transformations either.

11:42.458 --> 11:45.583
It says here that you can catch
a wizard sickness

11:45.583 --> 11:47.875
from a spell
that has been contaminated.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.333
Well, I have been feeling
kinda sick.

11:50.333 --> 11:54.833
In that weird wizard way,
when you get all gassy,
but it's in your left calf.

11:56.125 --> 11:59.291
- Right? Ew.
- Wait...

11:59.291 --> 12:03.375
Itchy, watery eyes,
calf gas,

12:03.375 --> 12:08.208
uncontrollable transformation...
you're both sick.

12:12.208 --> 12:14.833
Max, you must have
been infected

12:14.833 --> 12:17.000
when you used the
transformation spell.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.583
Oh no, another infection?
This one better leave a scar.

12:21.458 --> 12:24.000
Guys! Guess what? OK...

12:24.000 --> 12:26.708
So, remember how nobody
was coming to my party, right?

12:26.708 --> 12:30.375
Well, now everybody's coming
to my party because of Shakira.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.708
It's gonna be one
for the history books.

12:40.708 --> 12:43.875
OK. Yeah, that's...
That's very funny

12:43.875 --> 12:46.083
but you better not do that when
the real Shakira's here.

12:46.083 --> 12:50.125
There is only one Shakira
and I'm her.

12:50.125 --> 12:52.583
But I can't control
when I turn into her.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.875
So, uh...

12:57.291 --> 12:59.291
How's your day going?

13:09.583 --> 13:12.208
Justin, I thought I had
this wizard germ handled,

13:12.208 --> 13:13.875
but I don't, I need your help.

13:13.875 --> 13:15.125
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't go

13:15.125 --> 13:16.750
straight to the Wizard Council
with this.

13:18.416 --> 13:21.083
Be... Because I'm family?

13:21.083 --> 13:23.208
Since when did you ever
start caring about family?

13:23.208 --> 13:26.458
Hey! Family is important.

13:26.458 --> 13:29.625
They're the people that have to
be nice to you, no matter what.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.833
Justin! Justin...

13:33.833 --> 13:36.250
If you turn Kelbo in, all you're
going to do is remind them

13:36.250 --> 13:41.083
that you're related
to him. And me.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.375
Keep talking.

13:45.708 --> 13:48.458
Look, if you help,

13:48.458 --> 13:52.458
when I'm 30 and Mom and Dad
kick me out of the house,

13:52.458 --> 13:55.750
I promise I will not
move in with you

13:55.750 --> 13:58.583
and your cute
but irritating wife.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.875
Good. Because Stephanie and I
both agree

14:01.875 --> 14:06.125
that it's high time you stopped
bouncing between our guest
bedroom and jail.

14:08.625 --> 14:11.625
And yes, that's right,
her name will be Stephanie.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.458
Great. I'm gonna go
cancel the party.

14:15.458 --> 14:16.750
You get to work
finding a cure.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.000
OK.

14:34.291 --> 14:37.083
All right. Attention please.
Attention.

14:37.083 --> 14:40.000
I have an announcement.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Justin's stupid party
has been cancelled.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.875
What?

14:45.875 --> 14:47.333
What about Shakira?

14:49.208 --> 14:52.958
Shakira... is gone.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.500
Because her bus got fixed

14:56.500 --> 14:59.625
and now her tour with the
Harlem Globetrotters can resume.

14:59.625 --> 15:02.750
So, anyone wanting
to see Shakira should just,

15:02.750 --> 15:04.583
well, wake up
and smell the roses.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.458
She's an international
pop star.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.500
Why would she want to come to
a run-down sandwich shop

15:08.500 --> 15:10.083
on the verge of bankruptcy?

15:11.166 --> 15:13.000
Why should we trust you?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.958
She's always trying
to pull stuff on us.

15:14.958 --> 15:16.833
Yeah!

15:16.833 --> 15:19.166
That is an excellent question.

15:19.166 --> 15:22.291
All right, now I know
I usually can't be trusted...

15:24.708 --> 15:30.500
...but, but... this time I'm not
putting one over on you.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.875
I'm putting one over on Justin

15:33.875 --> 15:36.833
by getting you
to not go to his party.

15:36.833 --> 15:40.083
- Ah...
- That makes sense.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.125
So you're not
putting one over on us?

15:42.125 --> 15:44.500
Oh, of course not.

15:46.291 --> 15:49.500
OK then. You know, It feels good
to be on the inside.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.708
Yeah, no, you are
so on the inside.

15:51.708 --> 15:57.375
- Yeah. MacGruder in... side.
- Yeah.

16:06.625 --> 16:10.375
OK, we need to get the germ
out of you guys,

16:10.375 --> 16:13.458
by drinking this smoothie made
of troll liver, dragon tongue,

16:13.458 --> 16:16.000
cinnamon and elf eye-boogers.

16:18.750 --> 16:21.583
Oh! Eew!

16:21.583 --> 16:23.583
I hate cinnamon.

16:25.708 --> 16:27.416
You know how this is going
to turn out, don't you?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.416
Spit take!

16:33.416 --> 16:35.833
I hate it! I hate it!
I'm not drinking it.

16:37.458 --> 16:41.083
Hey Justin,
just dump mine in me.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.250
No, no, no, wait, wait!

16:43.250 --> 16:47.291
Drink it, then spit it in me.
Like a mommy bird.

17:00.708 --> 17:03.000
All right. Nobody make fun
of my big can.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.708
The smoothie
only worked halfway.

17:06.708 --> 17:09.000
Well, I don't think
I should drink any of that.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.416
You don't want to see
Shakira's head ruin this body.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.250
Sorry, people.
Party cancelled.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.958
No sense hanging around.
Move it along.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.583
- Wait. That's Shakira!
- What?

17:24.583 --> 17:26.458
Nobody on this block
is that hot.

17:26.458 --> 17:28.250
Come on everybody!
Shakira's here!

17:28.250 --> 17:30.291
I'm gonna stare at her
'til I'm arrested!

17:30.291 --> 17:32.000
Wait, no!

17:32.000 --> 17:34.708
No. That's just one of those
crazy dancing balloons

17:34.708 --> 17:38.708
that gets you to come into
the restaurant and you...
don't fall for it!

17:40.708 --> 17:41.708
Wait.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.708
Alex, Uncle Kelbo's upstairs.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.583
You were supposed to
get rid of everyone.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.833
They saw Shakira and they're not
gonna leave until they see her.

17:48.833 --> 17:51.958
She's must be up there.
Shakira, come down,

17:51.958 --> 17:53.833
- or we're coming up!
- No!

17:55.833 --> 17:58.250
- What are we gonna do?
- OK, well...

17:58.250 --> 18:00.375
We have no choice. We gotta
give 'em what they want.

18:00.375 --> 18:03.333
OK, so we'll show them
Shakira and then they'll leave.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.625
OK, all right, people.
Calm down.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.500
Shakira's not gonna come down
unless you behave yourselves.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.333
That's exactly right.
She's on a tight schedule.

18:12.333 --> 18:15.000
She's gonna make an appearance
and then she's gonna leave.

18:16.375 --> 18:19.625
Shakira, are you up there?!

18:19.625 --> 18:21.125
Yeah, it's me!

18:22.875 --> 18:26.125
Uh, wait a second...

18:27.250 --> 18:29.625
Never mind. I'm back.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.875
OK, OK. Well, come down here
and meet your fans. Quickly.

18:32.875 --> 18:36.583
Because you're on a tight
schedule that could change
at any moment.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.500
I love New York City!

18:45.500 --> 18:47.708
That's where we live, Shakira!

18:47.708 --> 18:48.708
That's right.

18:48.708 --> 18:50.416
All right. Thank you, Shakira.

18:50.416 --> 18:52.083
I hope everybody had
a great time. Goodbye!

18:54.416 --> 18:57.750
Wait. I'm International Pop
Star Shakira and I must dance.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.750
- Uh! No!
- Shakira!

19:00.750 --> 19:02.958
- Shakira, dance back upstairs!
- Shakira!

19:02.958 --> 19:06.291
- Shakira, no!
- Shakira, wait, wait...

19:06.291 --> 19:07.958
- Shakira!
- Maybe if we say it in Spanish.

19:07.958 --> 19:11.708
- Shakira!
- Shakira!

19:13.500 --> 19:17.000
Jerry, our kids are having
a party while we're gone.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
With Shakira.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.625
Let's dance.

19:36.125 --> 19:38.458
What happened to Shakira?

19:38.458 --> 19:41.333
Yeah, what happened to Shakira?

19:43.833 --> 19:45.958
Oh...

19:51.958 --> 19:53.750
What's going on here?

19:53.750 --> 19:56.500
I was fine with spontaneously
dancing with Shakira.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.583
But now that I know it's Kelbo,

19:58.583 --> 20:00.833
I'm very
disappointed in all of you.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.583
It... It's Justin's party.

20:03.583 --> 20:06.375
Alex.

20:06.375 --> 20:09.291
It was Dad's idea
to leave us with Kelbo.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.583
Which was totally misguided
and I apologize.

20:12.583 --> 20:16.166
Wizard rule number one:
Thou shall not expose magic
to non-wizards.

20:16.166 --> 20:19.500
You know what's worse than Kelbo
breaking wizard rule number one?

20:19.500 --> 20:21.291
Me breaking
wizard rule number one.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.583
I'm too young to have my
hands broken. There's
so much I want to build.

20:28.291 --> 20:29.750
Great.

20:31.583 --> 20:32.583
Follow me.

20:34.125 --> 20:36.208
OK, uh... Everybody,

20:36.208 --> 20:37.708
There's been a mistake.

20:37.708 --> 20:40.000
You all thought that Shakira
was coming to the party,

20:40.000 --> 20:45.833
but actually it's a "Come as
Shakira to the Party" Party.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.166
Yeah.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.958
You can hardly tell
the difference, huh?

20:54.875 --> 20:56.708
MacGruder and crowd out.

20:58.208 --> 21:02.166
Great, MacGruder just left.
What are we doing?

21:03.375 --> 21:05.583
I think I understand
what was going on here

21:05.583 --> 21:07.416
and I'm not happy about it.

21:07.416 --> 21:08.500
Hey, guys.

21:10.333 --> 21:13.291
Is it... Is it
family picture day already?

21:18.166 --> 21:21.000
OK, I have no idea
what's going on here.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.458
Alex, before I leave,
we need to make a prank call.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.583
Well, you must be
feeling better.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.458
Oh, so much better.

21:39.458 --> 21:42.708
You know,
all that smoothie needed was
a little more eye-booger,

21:42.708 --> 21:46.375
It was fantastic and it got rid
of that horrible cinnamon taste.

21:46.375 --> 21:50.125
Beep, beep, boop, boop,
boop, boop, beep, boop.

21:50.125 --> 21:52.250
Boopy doopy doop.

21:55.625 --> 21:57.583
Hello, Justin Russo?

21:57.583 --> 22:01.166
This is Professor Lotion
from the Wizard Council.

22:01.166 --> 22:05.750
We've received reports that you
have been breaking sacred wizard
rules.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.875
Please hold for vice-chairman.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.875
Hello.
This is Vice-Chairman Higglebottom.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.166
We're coming over
to break your hands.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.708
Hey guys, what's going on?

22:20.708 --> 22:21.875
You're not gonna believe
what we just...

22:21.875 --> 22:23.875
Run!
