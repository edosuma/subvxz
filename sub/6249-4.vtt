WEBVTT

00:04.567 --> 00:06.700
Okay, Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth.

00:07.534 --> 00:10.567
Together.
A little closer.

00:10.634 --> 00:12.534
Okay, yeah, that's perfect.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.067
Beautiful.

00:14.134 --> 00:16.134
Now keeping your back
straight, I want you

00:16.201 --> 00:17.433
each to lean forward.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.667
No.

00:19.734 --> 00:21.333
Excuse me?
Come on, Booth.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.500
I'm sure this is just one of
those meaningless exercises

00:23.567 --> 00:24.634
meant to illustrate
the importance

00:24.700 --> 00:26.634
of supporting
each other.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.634
We agreed to see
another therapist,

00:28.700 --> 00:30.734
not be action figures
for a 12-year-old.

00:30.801 --> 00:33.734
I'm 22, Agent Booth.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.834
I have a doctorate in
psychology from the University

00:35.901 --> 00:38.467
of Pennsylvania,
where my dissertation

00:38.534 --> 00:40.567
on the effects of job stress
was published.
That's great.

00:40.634 --> 00:42.534
I'm sure mom
is really proud of you, Sweets.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.467
Dr. Sweets, or Lance, you know,

00:45.534 --> 00:47.101
if you're more comfortable
with informality,

00:47.168 --> 00:49.901
but I'd prefer,
out of respect for each other

00:49.967 --> 00:50.934
and the process
of psychotherapy,

00:51.001 --> 00:53.201
that we at least try to, uh...

00:53.268 --> 00:54.201
Sign the forms

00:54.268 --> 00:55.734
so I can get out of this suit

00:55.801 --> 00:57.433
and I could have
a Saturday night.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.767
I don't care how
young you are.

01:00.834 --> 01:03.300
I've never believed
in psychotherapy.

01:04.534 --> 01:06.834
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan,
this isn't a game.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.667
The FBI is considering severing
your partnership.

01:09.734 --> 01:11.168
What?
Why?

01:11.234 --> 01:12.168
Why?

01:12.234 --> 01:14.001
Dude, you arrested her father.

01:14.067 --> 01:15.001
He was just

01:15.067 --> 01:16.767
doing his job.
Yeah,

01:16.834 --> 01:20.567
but come on, he, like,
he arrested your father.

01:20.634 --> 01:22.867
He's going to have
to be a witness against him.

01:22.934 --> 01:24.201
Circumstances such as these

01:24.268 --> 01:26.067
tend to stir up a lot
of scary feelings.
I don't have

01:26.134 --> 01:27.901
I don't have scary feelings.

01:27.967 --> 01:30.101
Maybe you need a little
night-light at night to sleep.

01:30.168 --> 01:32.600
Agent Booth, you've been trying
to intimidate me

01:32.667 --> 01:34.300
since the moment
you stepped in here.

01:34.367 --> 01:36.201
And you've succeeded.
Don't...

01:36.268 --> 01:38.067
scare the boy, Booth.

01:38.134 --> 01:39.433
Now, I need you both

01:39.500 --> 01:42.867
to, uh, fill out
these questionnaires

01:42.934 --> 01:45.268
and get 'em back to me.

01:47.468 --> 01:48.734
Don't share your anwsers

01:49.734 --> 01:51.001
It'll help me evaluate

01:51.067 --> 01:52.967
whether Dr. Brennan's services
should be signed

01:53.034 --> 01:54.333
to a new agent.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.467
That's not going to happen.
Like it or not,

01:56.534 --> 02:00.400
Agent Booth, I'm the therapist
in charge of this case,

02:00.467 --> 02:04.268
so I suggest that we work
in cooperation

02:04.333 --> 02:06.101
rather than conflict.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.901
I can cooperate.

02:07.967 --> 02:09.633
Good.

02:09.699 --> 02:10.901
Agent Booth?

02:10.967 --> 02:14.500
I'm still going
to call you Sweets.

02:14.567 --> 02:17.333
Yep.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.734
It's some kind
of personality test.

02:19.801 --> 02:21.433
I can't believe he
gave us homework.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.268
You know, probably his.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.134
What kind of kid works
on a Saturday night?

02:25.201 --> 02:26.367
Oh, that's my fault.

02:26.433 --> 02:27.934
I told him I wasn't available
during the week.

02:28.001 --> 02:29.400
Whoa, whoa, why'd
you go and do that?

02:29.467 --> 02:32.333
You know, I had, I had seats
right behind the dugout.

02:33.934 --> 02:35.433
Booth.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.767
Don't look on my paper.

02:37.834 --> 02:39.801
Okay, yeah, got it.

02:39.867 --> 02:41.433
Well,
there's only one thing

02:41.500 --> 02:44.834
more fun than therapy
on a Saturday night

02:44.901 --> 02:46.600
and that's a dead body.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.801 --> 02:59.534
Look at all
the cars.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.567
I thought the VA
hospital was closed.

03:01.634 --> 03:03.567
Well, it is, Bones,
but I mean, come on.

03:03.634 --> 03:05.101
It's the weekend, right?

03:05.168 --> 03:06.567
An abandoned building
surrounded

03:06.634 --> 03:09.134
by acres
of secluded land.

03:10.201 --> 03:12.834
Use your imagination.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.700
Teenagers, hormones.

03:15.767 --> 03:18.034
You're saying
they're here to fornicate.

03:18.101 --> 03:19.034
Yes.

03:19.101 --> 03:22.034
Nice image, very, uh, biblical.

03:23.101 --> 03:24.168
These two were on their way

03:24.234 --> 03:25.867
to a romantic encounter
under the stars

03:25.934 --> 03:27.567
and literally tripped over the remains.

03:27.634 --> 03:29.500
Oh, I'm guessing
that killed the mood.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.333
I've got patchy tissue.

03:31.333 --> 03:35.433
But this level of decomp

03:35.433 --> 03:37.134
pushes things
into your territory.

03:37.201 --> 03:39.234
I haven't
touched it yet.
Definitely not homeless...

03:39.300 --> 03:42.101
nice watch, good shoes,
at least what's left of them.

03:42.168 --> 03:43.101
Male,

03:43.168 --> 03:45.101
middle-aged.

03:45.168 --> 03:47.767
Level of decomp would suggest
he's been out here a few weeks,

03:47.834 --> 03:49.400
but...
I don't get it.

03:49.467 --> 03:51.234
Kids coming here
every night

03:51.300 --> 03:53.201
and they're just
noticing him now...

03:53.268 --> 03:54.634
Dumped at the
top of the hill?

03:54.700 --> 03:56.134
And he rolled down.
Would explain the amount

03:56.201 --> 03:58.333
of fresh mud and
leaves on the body.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.667
These bones are still greasy.

04:00.734 --> 04:02.034
Did you take
an internal temperature?

04:02.101 --> 04:03.067
With this degree

04:03.134 --> 04:04.801
of decomp, why would it matter?

04:04.867 --> 04:07.034
Maybe he hasn't been dead
as long as he looks.

04:07.101 --> 04:08.134
The body is still radiating

04:08.201 --> 04:11.867
a lot of heat.
Wow, you're not kidding.

04:11.934 --> 04:14.234
We used to use
the local golf course.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.433
I remember taking
Mary Ann Milano

04:15.500 --> 04:17.666
to the ninth hole...
sand trap.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.567
She had long hair all the way...

04:19.634 --> 04:21.934
You are so going to
regret telling this story.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.201
Okay, now what do you got?

04:28.634 --> 04:31.967
127 degrees?

04:32.034 --> 04:32.967
Wow, that's really

04:33.034 --> 04:34.801
not normal.
No, that's

04:34.867 --> 04:36.934
way past really not normal.

04:37.001 --> 04:40.268
You're saying that before
the body was dumped it was...

04:40.333 --> 04:41.634
Cooked.
Cooked?

04:41.700 --> 04:43.467
Cooked.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.634
Has it occurred
to either of you

05:24.700 --> 05:25.867
that this might
be another victim

05:25.934 --> 05:27.201
in the Widow's Son case?

05:27.267 --> 05:28.301
Based on what?

05:28.367 --> 05:30.668
Because the victim was cooked
like an entry,

05:30.733 --> 05:32.501
sa
There's no evidence

05:32.568 --> 05:34.700
here to suggest cannibalism...

05:34.767 --> 05:36.601
no bite marks.
No condiments.

05:36.668 --> 05:38.967
We have a bullet hole in
the sternum, Dr. Brennan.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.234
What guy in Germany?

05:40.301 --> 05:42.134
He ran a computer ad
online,

05:42.201 --> 05:43.634
said he was looking
for someone to eat.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.700
There's an excessive
amount of mud

05:45.767 --> 05:47.334
and debris
from the dump site.

05:47.401 --> 05:49.634
It makes it difficult to get
a clear view of the injury.

05:49.700 --> 05:50.767
Yeah, tell me about it.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.733
I have to separate and
distinguish particulates

05:52.800 --> 05:55.634
and insects from the body's
original location.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.301
People actually
replied to the ad?

05:57.367 --> 05:58.534
Oh, yeah.

05:58.601 --> 06:00.301
Guy ended up feasting
on a computer engineer.

06:00.367 --> 06:02.833
That's extremely disturbing.

06:02.900 --> 06:06.000
Well, hello, my exotic princess.

06:06.067 --> 06:08.800
What a charmingly inappropriate
greeting, Dr. Hodgins.

06:08.867 --> 06:10.501
I think he's talking to a bug.

06:10.568 --> 06:12.134
Well, now I feel
a bit... rejected.

06:12.201 --> 06:13.134
Looks like something

06:13.201 --> 06:15.234
from the Nitidulidae family.

06:15.301 --> 06:18.700
Where did you come from,
you gorgeous creature?

06:18.767 --> 06:20.334
Do you have any friends?

06:20.401 --> 06:23.267
Boy, he melted like ic
cream on a hot summer day.

06:23.334 --> 06:25.301
So when do I get
my turn with him?

06:25.367 --> 06:26.867
Oh, we should be finished
within...

06:26.934 --> 06:27.867
20 minutes.

06:27.934 --> 06:30.301
Excellent.
Wow.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.201
I'm finding a large
concentration of bristletails

06:32.267 --> 06:35.401
and harvester ants dead
by the victim's feet.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.967
That is odd.

06:37.034 --> 06:38.000
SARYOYAN:
The guy was
cooked, Hodgins.

06:38.067 --> 06:41.700
Odd is kind of a relative term.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.601
Angela called.
She wanted me to...

06:47.634 --> 06:49.934
Hey, is that the test
from Dr. Sweets?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.034
Yes.
Well, what'd you put
for number seven?

06:52.100 --> 06:54.568
Because I put 12 to 15 times
a day, and now I'm thinking

06:54.634 --> 06:56.900
I really
misunderstood the question.

06:56.967 --> 06:59.134
We're not supposed to
discuss our answers.
Come on,

06:59.201 --> 07:00.967
Bones, the teacher's
not in the room, let me see.

07:01.034 --> 07:02.267
Is this how you got
through school, Booth?

07:02.334 --> 07:03.267
No.

07:03.334 --> 07:04.601
Well, maybe algebra, but...

07:04.668 --> 07:07.601
Hey, Booth,
I got your I.D.

07:07.668 --> 07:08.934
Franklin Curtis,
age 54.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.134
His wife Margie

07:10.201 --> 07:11.733
reported him
missing yesterday.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.733
Whoa...
Augusta county.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.601
He was rich.
Yeah.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.167
Founder of the Natural Sun
organic supermarket chain.

07:17.234 --> 07:18.267
There's one near
my apartment.

07:18.334 --> 07:20.767
Excellent selection
of local produce.

07:20.833 --> 07:22.000
Totally overpriced.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.067
A carrot is a carrot.

07:23.134 --> 07:24.100
MONTENEGRO:
Hey, it's worth it.

07:24.167 --> 07:26.700
Organic, there's no pesticides.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.234
It's from sustainable farms.

07:28.301 --> 07:31.467
Every time that I buy something
there, I feel so virtuous.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.733
Guy started off with a single
roadside produce stand,

07:33.800 --> 07:36.568
which he grew into a nationwide
supermarket chain.

07:36.634 --> 07:38.934
An organic capitalist.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.833
Ambition like that is bound
to create a few enemies.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.234
HODGINS:
I tested fabric samples from the victim's pants

07:42.301 --> 07:44.967
They were covered
with chloropicrin.

07:46.301 --> 07:48.067
Why the pinchy face, Bones?

07:48.134 --> 07:50.467
Franklin Curtis built
his whole career

07:50.534 --> 07:52.833
on organic produce
and chloropicrin...

07:52.900 --> 07:54.467
Is a pesticide.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.967
I was at a yoga retreat
with my daughter.

08:01.034 --> 08:04.534
When Frank didn't answer
the phone, I got worried.

08:04.601 --> 08:05.601
Here, Mom.

08:05.668 --> 08:07.034
Ignatia Amara.

08:09.434 --> 08:12.201
It's a homeopathic
remedy for grief.

08:12.267 --> 08:13.467
When we came home,

08:13.534 --> 08:15.833
there was a cup of herbal tea
on the counter

08:15.900 --> 08:20.201
as if he'd just...
stepped out for a moment.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.201
I noticed the fields
as we drove in.

08:22.267 --> 08:23.534
You still operate
the farm?

08:23.601 --> 08:26.534
No matter how big
the business got,

08:26.601 --> 08:29.167
Dad always wanted
to remember how it all started.

08:29.234 --> 08:30.301
BRENNAN:
Your farm, it's...

08:30.367 --> 08:32.167
certified organic, correct?

08:32.234 --> 08:33.167
No pesticides

08:33.234 --> 08:34.601
besides
natural predators?

08:34.668 --> 08:35.799
Of course.

08:35.866 --> 08:38.467
Your husband, was he having
any personal problems,

08:38.534 --> 08:41.467
recent arguments?
No, everybody loved Frank.

08:41.534 --> 08:42.700
Mom.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.867
Your dad was a
wonderful man.

08:44.934 --> 08:48.034
My dad was kind of obsessed.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.967
He'd pressure conventional
farmers to go organic.

08:50.034 --> 08:52.900
"Pressure" makes
it sound so...

08:52.967 --> 08:53.967
He was an extremely
generous man.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.301
He offered to
support them

08:55.367 --> 08:58.568
financially,
while they made the transition.

08:58.634 --> 09:00.634
What if a farmer didn't want
to switch?

09:00.700 --> 09:03.833
Dad would turn things
over to his lawyers.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.367
They'd find some
legal loophole.

09:05.434 --> 09:07.568
Property taxes,
zoning, who knows?

09:07.634 --> 09:10.568
Eventually Dad would
just buy them out.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.900
And he'd force people
off their land.

09:14.234 --> 09:16.067
I see.

09:16.134 --> 09:19.534
Any farmers he was trying
to convert?

09:24.134 --> 09:25.934
Yeah, Mr. Harding?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.367
Something I
can help you with?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.000
Yeah, FBI Special
Agent Seeley Booth.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.767
This here is my partner
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.100
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about Franklin Curtis.

09:35.134 --> 09:37.501
You can tell that son of
a bitch that the only crop

09:37.568 --> 09:39.367
that will ever grow in
this land is tobacco.

09:39.434 --> 09:40.833
I don't give a crap

09:40.900 --> 09:43.067
how many suits he sends
overe.

09:43.134 --> 09:44.733
He, he didn't send us,
Mr. Harding.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.367
Franklin Curtis is dead.

09:46.434 --> 09:49.934
Well, I wish I could muster up
some remorse.

09:51.167 --> 09:53.700
No love lost between
the two of you, I see.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.234
The man was trying
to kick me off of my own land.

09:56.301 --> 09:59.267
My family has been on this farm
for over 150 years.

09:59.334 --> 10:01.534
Tobacco built this
country, yet these

10:01.601 --> 10:03.334
self-righteous eco-hippies
have the nerve

10:03.401 --> 10:04.767
to look down their nose at us.

10:04.833 --> 10:07.301
Did you see Frank last Thursday?

10:07.367 --> 10:09.800
N-Not that I can recall.
Really?

10:09.867 --> 10:12.267
Because Virginia Pesticide Control Board reports
that you registered

10:12.334 --> 10:16.401
an application of chloropicrin
to your field last Thursday,

10:16.467 --> 10:17.467
the same day Frank disappeared.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.467
So?

10:18.534 --> 10:19.467
It's a fumigant insecticide.

10:19.534 --> 10:20.501
It's perfectly legal.

10:20.568 --> 10:21.900
It was all over
Frank's clothing.

10:21.967 --> 10:24.434
BOOTH:
All... over.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.601
Okay, he did come over.

10:28.668 --> 10:30.301
He said he was giving
me one last chance

10:30.367 --> 10:31.900
before he started
playing dirty.

10:31.967 --> 10:33.534
I was spraying the fields.

10:33.601 --> 10:35.967
I may have accidentally aimed
the chem hose at him.

10:36.034 --> 10:39.267
Accidentally.
Look, I swear I wasn't
trying to hurt him.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.100
I just wanted him
off my property.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.301
You understand?

10:42.367 --> 10:46.167
Who the hell was he to
take my land from me?

10:48.034 --> 10:50.334
BOOTH:
I'm just saying
the guy had a point.

10:50.401 --> 10:51.733
If pesticides are
so bad for us,

10:51.800 --> 10:54.467
then how come people live
longer now than they did

10:54.534 --> 10:56.601
before they used pesticides?

10:56.668 --> 10:58.034
You're over-simplifying

10:58.100 --> 11:00.267
an enormously complex issue.
(chuckles)

11:00.334 --> 11:02.034
Meaning you don't
have a good answer.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.201
The arguments in favor
of organic farming

11:04.267 --> 11:06.100
aren't just about food safety.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.201
They're about prevention
of soil erosion,

11:08.267 --> 11:10.467
protection
of water quality,

11:10.534 --> 11:12.501
carbon emissions from shipping,
not to mention...

11:12.568 --> 11:14.134
Whatever, you know what,
you're not going to see me

11:14.201 --> 11:16.000
paying four dollars
for a tomato.

11:18.733 --> 11:21.000
You know, a researcher

11:21.067 --> 11:23.733
at the University of Florida
proved that

11:23.800 --> 11:26.401
alligators who swim
in pesticide contaminated

11:26.467 --> 11:28.800
waters have smaller genitalia

11:28.867 --> 11:30.867
than their clean-water
counterparts.

11:30.934 --> 11:33.900
No way.

11:33.967 --> 11:35.100
Way.

11:37.134 --> 11:39.833
See? Right there.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.401
There's some kind of pattern

11:41.467 --> 11:44.000
on what's left
of the skin tissue.

11:44.067 --> 11:45.434
I'm hoping a more
artistic eye

11:45.501 --> 11:46.867
than mine can
make sense of it.

11:46.934 --> 11:50.501
MONTENEGRO:
Regular circular shapes,
cross-hatching,

11:50.568 --> 11:52.167
I'd say button marks.

11:52.234 --> 11:54.100
Like buttons
from the victim's shirt

11:54.167 --> 11:56.800
were pressed into his flesh
while he decomposed.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.100
Yes, that's exactly
what they are.

11:59.167 --> 12:00.634
Glad to help.

12:00.700 --> 12:03.467
Here's the thing, though.

12:03.534 --> 12:06.201
Our victim's clothing
doesn't have any buttons.

12:08.634 --> 12:12.034
BOOTH:
Yeah, in this whole
environmental footprint thing,

12:12.100 --> 12:14.367
right, I mean, why shouldn't
I leave a footprint?

12:14.434 --> 12:15.800
I'm here, right?

12:15.867 --> 12:18.401
Hey, why should I have fewer
rights than any other species?

12:20.334 --> 12:23.167
Hey, Bones, you know we're
having a lively discussion here.

12:23.234 --> 12:24.833
Tobacco has to be cured.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.134
Yeah, I know, and it kills you.

12:26.201 --> 12:27.733
We're on the same
side with that one.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.401
Curing at tobacco farms
is done in curing barns,

12:30.467 --> 12:32.767
using indirect fired burners.

12:32.833 --> 12:36.467
Oh, so if Frank's body were
in Harding's curing barn,

12:36.534 --> 12:38.467
that would explain
how it got cooked.

12:40.867 --> 12:42.367
Brennan.

12:42.434 --> 12:44.833
That should be enough
to get a warrant to
search the farm.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.534
There's what?

12:46.601 --> 12:47.900
Skin slippage.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.100
Our victim was pressed up
against another body

12:50.167 --> 12:53.601
and during whatever heating
process the two went through,

12:53.668 --> 12:55.434
the second corpse's tissue

12:55.501 --> 12:57.568
basically melted
onto our victim.

12:57.634 --> 12:59.934
Thanks.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.134
What, we got big news
from the nerd posse?

13:02.201 --> 13:03.900
When we search the tobacco farm,

13:03.967 --> 13:06.301
we'll be looking
for more than the murder site.

13:07.634 --> 13:10.767
We'll be looking
for a second victim.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.667
I'm making lemonade.

13:21.733 --> 13:23.201
BOOTH:
Lemonade!

13:23.267 --> 13:25.201
It's awful hot today.

13:25.267 --> 13:27.934
It's an intrusion, Elizabeth,
not a garden party.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.401
Agent Booth, ma'am.

13:29.468 --> 13:31.301
Elizabeth Harding.
Pleasure to meet you.

13:31.367 --> 13:32.834
Listen, we won't be any longer
than we have to.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.600
Shame about Mr. Curtis.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.733
Uh, we don't have
to talk to them, Elizabeth.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.334
Don't mind Mr. Grouchy.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.900
Did you know
Mr. Curtis personally?

13:39.967 --> 13:41.000
Oh, of course.

13:41.067 --> 13:43.568
Although, maybe
not as personally

13:43.633 --> 13:45.401
Elizabeth...
as he might have liked.

13:45.468 --> 13:46.867
How's that?

13:46.934 --> 13:48.034
Andy didn't tell you?

13:48.101 --> 13:49.568
No.
Oh, he get so jealous.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.167
No reason.

13:51.234 --> 13:53.534
Looks aren't everything.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.101
Mr. Curtis
was a big flirt.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.067
Always making
passes at me.

13:57.134 --> 13:58.367
It didn't seem relevant.

13:58.434 --> 14:00.900
And right under his
poor wife's nose, too.

14:00.967 --> 14:02.600
Fool thought he could get me

14:02.667 --> 14:04.700
to convince Andy
to sell the farm.

14:04.767 --> 14:06.700
Elizabeth!
Oh, don't you start again.

14:06.767 --> 14:10.767
When I told Andy, I don't think
I have ever seen him so mad.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.867
What a temper
you have.

14:12.934 --> 14:14.067
Thank you, Mrs. Harding.

14:14.134 --> 14:16.034
You have been very helpful.

14:16.101 --> 14:17.201
Tell Andy.

14:17.301 --> 14:19.234
He doesn't think
I can do anything right.

14:19.301 --> 14:21.534
So how many lemonades?

14:21.600 --> 14:23.101
Oh, how many lemonades?

14:26.267 --> 14:28.101
Make a pitcher. Great.

14:31.767 --> 14:34.367
Put solar panels
on my house.

14:34.434 --> 14:36.600
Compact fluorescents
in every socket and still

14:36.667 --> 14:38.934
feel guilty when I use
a paper napkin.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.834
I've been looking
at low-impact housing.

14:40.900 --> 14:45.301
I saw a free-standing house
that was 118 square feet.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.568
This entry to the sternum
might not be a bullet hole.

14:47.633 --> 14:48.568
Wait, wait, wait.

14:48.633 --> 14:51.267
118 square feet?

14:51.334 --> 14:53.234
Dude, that's smaller than
the janitor's closet.

14:53.301 --> 14:54.568
There's room for a bed,

14:54.633 --> 14:56.234
kitchen on one wall
and a small bathroom.

14:56.301 --> 14:57.834
I don't really see
why I would need more.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.401
Isn't the goal to reduce
our impact on the environment?

15:00.468 --> 15:02.067
Our lives aren't
only about function.

15:02.134 --> 15:05.167
We are allowed to enjoy
ourselves occasionally.

15:05.234 --> 15:06.800
That's why I work.

15:06.867 --> 15:09.101
Yes, finally.
Identified my mystery bug.

15:09.167 --> 15:11.967
Carpophilus nitidulidae.
King of the lab!

15:12.034 --> 15:14.134
It's an agricultural pest,

15:14.201 --> 15:16.201
found on pineapple plants.

15:16.267 --> 15:17.534
Agent Booth?

15:17.600 --> 15:19.667
There's nothing,
the curing shed is clean.

15:19.733 --> 15:21.800
Yeah, but the body
was cooked, and there
should be another body, too.

15:21.867 --> 15:23.334
Not here.

15:23.401 --> 15:24.534
More lemonade?
Yes, please.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.000
No, no, no, just go back
inside and check.

15:27.067 --> 15:29.267
I'll take half a glass.

15:31.767 --> 15:33.201
Booth.

15:33.267 --> 15:35.934
He was around pineapple plants
at the time of his death.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.201
Pineapples?

15:37.267 --> 15:38.800
Hodgins found insect activity

15:38.867 --> 15:40.600
that's only found
on pineapple plants.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.534
But the closest place
they're grown commercially

15:42.600 --> 15:43.867
is Florida.

15:43.934 --> 15:46.267
You're saying that the body
was moved from Florida?

15:46.334 --> 15:49.067
I don't have an explanation,
I'm just giving you the facts.

15:49.134 --> 15:50.334
I found this article

15:50.401 --> 15:51.834
about the environmental impact

15:51.900 --> 15:54.834
caused by transporting crops
over long distances.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.067
It mentions
this farmer in Virginia

15:57.134 --> 15:59.967
who was trying to grow
tropical crops in a hot house.

16:00.034 --> 16:01.201
Like pineapples?

16:01.267 --> 16:03.134
Like pineapples.

16:03.201 --> 16:04.900
Thanks.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.568
Thanks.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.301
Boy, sorry to hear about Frank.

16:11.367 --> 16:12.800
He was a good man.

16:12.867 --> 16:14.434
A big supporter of what
I'm trying to do here.

16:14.501 --> 16:16.034
All right, Mr. Paige...
Please, call me Lyndon.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.568
You ever eat a pineapple for the same day with picked
Agent Booth?

16:18.633 --> 16:20.234
Actually, no, and...

16:20.301 --> 16:22.101
Let me make you each a smoothie.
That's okay.

16:22.167 --> 16:25.468
I'd love one.
Frank Curtis
ever visit your hot house?

16:25.534 --> 16:28.468
Once, back when
I first built it.

16:28.534 --> 16:30.633
He had some advice

16:30.700 --> 16:33.633
on how to maximize
sun exposure.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.134
BOOTH:
What's he doing?

16:40.201 --> 16:41.800
He's powering the blender.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.101
The wheel rim is attached
to a generator.

16:44.167 --> 16:46.367
This is rather ingenious.
Stay fit

16:46.434 --> 16:48.600
and save energy.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.167
I'm sure it'll catch on;
so, you and Frank,

16:50.234 --> 16:51.201
you ever have any problems?

16:51.267 --> 16:53.667
No, never.

16:53.733 --> 16:55.834
Probably helped
that I didn't have a wife

16:55.900 --> 16:57.301
for him to flirt with.
Seems Frank

16:57.367 --> 16:59.800
had a habit of hitting
on other people's wives.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.568
All great men have
their foibles.

17:01.633 --> 17:03.867
Go ahead and check out
the hot house.

17:03.934 --> 17:06.034
I'll bring these out
soon as they're done.

17:10.134 --> 17:11.700
Frank Curtis's wife
stood to gain the most

17:11.767 --> 17:12.767
from her husband's death.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.233
If she found out
he was cheating...

17:14.300 --> 17:15.700
But you said her alibi is solid.

17:15.767 --> 17:18.934
That doesn't mean we can't,
you know, double check.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.401
I bet Sweets was
picked that on all through school.

17:21.468 --> 17:23.666
And that's relevant now, why?

17:23.733 --> 17:24.900
You're kidding
me, right?

17:24.967 --> 17:26.568
Scrawny kid like that
sees me coming,

17:26.666 --> 17:28.434
a former jock,
and he's thinking to himself,

17:28.501 --> 17:30.834
"Time for a little
payback," you know?

17:30.900 --> 17:33.000
Make him fill out all
those stupid forms.

17:33.067 --> 17:35.434
Threatens to take
my partner away from me.

17:35.501 --> 17:37.134
These tubs are too small

17:37.201 --> 17:38.633
to fit anything.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.501
We're not going to find
the second victim here.

17:40.568 --> 17:42.301
Yeah, you know what,
you're right.

17:42.367 --> 17:44.101
So what do you
say we go check...

17:46.834 --> 17:50.167
Bones, was that you?

17:50.234 --> 17:51.733
Was what me?

17:51.800 --> 17:53.334
That smell.
I don't know what

17:53.401 --> 17:54.468
you're talking about.
Come on.

17:54.534 --> 17:55.867
Why don't girls just admit it?

17:55.934 --> 17:57.501
It's a natural bodily function.

17:57.568 --> 17:59.067
You're a scientist.

17:59.134 --> 18:00.667
Booth, I don't...

18:00.733 --> 18:01.834
That had to be you.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.767
It wasn't me!
"He who smelt it,

18:03.834 --> 18:05.834
dealt it."
How do you even
know that phrase?

18:05.900 --> 18:07.834
Phew, sorry about
that smell.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.334
Guess I left the vents open.

18:09.401 --> 18:11.667
Community composting facility
is about a mile away,

18:11.733 --> 18:13.034
but when the winds
blow westerly,

18:13.101 --> 18:15.167
it smells like it's
around the corner.

18:15.234 --> 18:17.834
Do you take agricultural wastes
to the composting facility?

18:17.900 --> 18:19.767
Re, almost every organic
farmer in the county does.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.501
It's a great program.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.301
You give them your
waste and in return,

18:23.367 --> 18:25.201
they give you
certified organic compost

18:25.267 --> 18:26.534
at a fraction
of the cost.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.934
Whoa, I wasn't
done with that.
I have an idea.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.800
Thank you very much, Lyndon.

18:29.867 --> 18:31.000
Your smoothies are excellent.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.101
Hey, hey, hey, do you have
any "to go" cups?

18:33.167 --> 18:34.800
The road to the apocalypse
is paved

18:34.867 --> 18:36.800
with disposable food containers,
my friend.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.800
HODGINS:
Compost, of course.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.301
The identifying organisms
would have started dying

18:40.367 --> 18:42.401
as soon as the body
was removed from the heat.

18:42.468 --> 18:43.867
But how high do
the temperatures get?

18:43.934 --> 18:47.301
Inside a large compost heap,
as high as 170 degrees.

18:47.367 --> 18:49.834
That's hot enough
to cook a body.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.934
And if Lyndon contributes
his waste to the pile,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.234
that could explain why
the pineapple beetle was there.

18:54.301 --> 18:58.700
Hey, you guys going to check out
a large compost pile?

18:58.767 --> 19:01.501
(quietly):
It's wrong how
excited he sounds.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.834
We've got five people
on staff full time.

19:12.900 --> 19:16.234
But there's 43 farmers
with keys to the gates.

19:16.301 --> 19:17.501
You all right?

19:17.568 --> 19:19.334
Yeah...
oh, just the smell.

19:19.401 --> 19:21.201
We've probably got a couple
masks in the office,

19:21.267 --> 19:22.700
you two want me to go...
I'm fine.

19:22.767 --> 19:24.568
Agent Booth tends
to be squeamish.

19:24.633 --> 19:26.667
Look, I'm fine, okay?

19:26.733 --> 19:28.401
So you were saying 43 farmers?

19:28.468 --> 19:29.967
They're welcome to dump
their own waste,

19:30.034 --> 19:34.000
otherwise we schedule
a pickup with our truck

19:34.067 --> 19:36.267
when it's Hey, Gavin.
WoOh, Tim Peck,

19:36.334 --> 19:37.834
Clay Ainsley,
couple of our local farmers.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.334
This is Agent Booth,
Dr. Brennan.

19:40.401 --> 19:41.767
They're here about Frank.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.534
Truck stopped running again,
Gavin.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.867
I think it needs
a new fuel filter.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.600
I just replaced it
two weeks ago.

19:46.667 --> 19:47.867
Yeah, when I switched
to bio-diesel,

19:47.934 --> 19:49.600
I went through
at least four fuel filters.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.800
It's a conversion,
loosens up the deposits.
You work here?

19:51.867 --> 19:54.267
Yes sir. Charlie Rogan.

19:54.334 --> 19:55.434
Did you know Frank Curtis?

19:55.501 --> 19:57.468
Very well.

19:57.534 --> 19:59.201
I only just heard
what happened to him.

19:59.267 --> 20:01.434
I dated his daughter
all through high school.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.600
Gavin introduced us.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.700
If there's anything I can do...

20:05.767 --> 20:07.301
Mr. Curtis was a great man.

20:07.367 --> 20:09.534
(scoffs)
Oh, you disagree?

20:09.600 --> 20:10.867
Frank Curtis was in it
for the money,

20:10.934 --> 20:12.267
not the cause.
Then why did he donate

20:12.334 --> 20:14.201
his entire estate
to environmental groups?

20:14.267 --> 20:15.667
We're talking millions.

20:15.733 --> 20:18.134
Even our corp
could see some.
You ever been to his house?

20:18.201 --> 20:21.067
4,000 square feet,
brand-new everything.

20:21.134 --> 20:22.733
Left his air conditioner
on all the time.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.800
Yeah, fat lot that man cared
about the environment.

20:24.867 --> 20:26.134
Don't mind him.

20:26.201 --> 20:28.267
The smell out here always puts him in a foul mood.

20:28.334 --> 20:29.867
Look, I'm going to need names and addresses

20:29.900 --> 20:30.934
of every employee... (groans)

20:31.000 --> 20:33.167
And a list of participating faers.

20:33.234 --> 20:35.434
And the facility has to be closed

20:35.501 --> 20:39.067
until all of the composis searched.

20:39.134 --> 20:40.900
We can get a warrant if you want.

20:40.967 --> 20:44.101
I do.

20:47.568 --> 20:48.867
Two independent people

20:48.934 --> 20:50.134
often find themselves...

20:51.201 --> 20:53.101
Agent Booth, are you listening?

20:53.167 --> 20:54.700
What?

20:54.767 --> 20:56.101
The judge will call when the warrant is issued,

20:56.167 --> 20:57.367
Booth, pay attention.

20:57.434 --> 20:58.834
What, I'm in the middle of an investigation.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.000
I get distracted. So it's not my investigation, too?

21:01.067 --> 21:02.434
It's too early in the morning for this.

21:02.501 --> 21:04.501
No, no, no, this is good, let's talk about conflict.

21:04.568 --> 21:06.267
When you guys argue, how do you come to a resolution?

21:06.334 --> 21:08.334
We don't argue. Come on, remember,

21:08.401 --> 21:11.034
zone of truth, right here. Fine.

21:11.101 --> 21:14.401
We might bicker a little bit,

21:14.468 --> 21:15.967
but that's not arguing. Bicker?

21:16.034 --> 21:17.534
I don't bicker. No?

21:17.600 --> 21:19.700
What about the whole environmentalism thing?

21:19.767 --> 21:21.568
That was a discussion. You pretty much told me

21:21.633 --> 21:24.234
my penis was going to shrink if I didn't eat organic food.

21:24.301 --> 21:25.401
That's not bickering,

21:25.468 --> 21:26.534
that's being a good friend.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.967
My penis is just fine, thank you.

21:28.034 --> 21:29.167
Now we're getting somewhere.

21:29.234 --> 21:30.800
All right, I think we're in that truth zone.

21:30.867 --> 21:32.201
Stop with the whole truth zone thing.

21:32.267 --> 21:34.800
Bones and I are trying to catch a guy who cooked a tree hugger.

21:34.867 --> 21:37.034
So just score the personality test so we can get

21:37.101 --> 21:38.767
back to crime fighting.

21:38.834 --> 21:40.000
Yeah, that's good, Agent Booth.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.434
Now let the anger lead you to the fear.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.733
You can't be whole,

21:43.800 --> 21:45.034
you can't do your job to its fullest,

21:45.101 --> 21:47.534
unless you get in touch with that fear you feel.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.434
Now Dr. Brennan and I are going to close our eyes.

21:52.434 --> 21:55.301
Follow the anger, all right?

21:55.367 --> 21:56.600
Feel it?

21:56.667 --> 21:58.234
Feel it softening.

21:58.301 --> 22:00.367
You feel that?

22:04.867 --> 22:06.667
Very mature, guys.

22:07.900 --> 22:09.633
Got to run, Sweets. Got the call.

22:09.700 --> 22:10.867
Let's boogie, Bones.

22:12.201 --> 22:15.301
And, um, look, next time, you really should

22:15.367 --> 22:18.900
tell me if there's going to be an essay on the test.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.434
I just got off the phone with Hodgins.

22:26.501 --> 22:27.834
He's knee-deep in compost.

22:27.900 --> 22:29.301
He must be happy.

22:29.367 --> 22:30.700
Happy as a pig in...

22:30.767 --> 22:32.201
what pigs like to be in.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.834
A sty?

22:33.900 --> 22:36.067
You said you had things to show me?

22:36.134 --> 22:38.501
From the injuries, it appears there was a struggle.

22:38.568 --> 22:40.101
You can see the bruising and fresh

22:40.167 --> 22:43.201
hairline fractures on the femurs and left ulna.

22:43.267 --> 22:44.900
Consistent with defensive wounds?

22:44.967 --> 22:46.733
That would be my assessment.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.733
So, there was a fight before he was shot?

22:48.800 --> 22:49.934
He wasn't shot.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.434
I thought you said it was a bullet hole.

22:51.501 --> 22:52.934
I was mistaken.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.034
It occasionally happens.

22:54.101 --> 22:55.167
The hole is actually

22:55.234 --> 22:57.201
a congenital abnormality.

22:57.267 --> 22:59.000
A sternal foramen.

22:59.067 --> 23:01.434
So we're back to no known cause of death? Not quite.

23:01.501 --> 23:04.434
I found multiple puncture wounds with hinge fracturing

23:04.501 --> 23:07.367
on the scapula and posterior aspects of several ribs.

23:07.434 --> 23:09.067
He was stabbed?

23:09.134 --> 23:10.267
By what?

23:10.334 --> 23:11.633
I'm working on it.

23:11.700 --> 23:14.767
Okay then. Enjoy.

23:18.633 --> 23:21.600
Oh, God, I'm never going to get over that smell.

23:21.667 --> 23:24.101
This place is awesome.

23:24.167 --> 23:26.834
The thermophilic bacteria content is off of the charts.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.234
No security cameras.

23:28.301 --> 23:30.067
Too high-tech for the granola crowd.

23:30.134 --> 23:31.733
That means we have about 100 suspects.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.934
Are you coming in?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.600
No... you know what? That's your thing.

23:34.667 --> 23:37.000
And I'll just, uh, mess things up if I come up there.

23:39.534 --> 23:41.600
I just heard a crunch.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.667
Definitely not plant life.

23:45.733 --> 23:47.667
D love to try this feeding fungi.

23:50.633 --> 23:51.568
That's adipocere.

23:51.633 --> 23:53.067
Is that good or bad?

23:53.134 --> 23:54.301
Good for us.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.733
Bad for the victim.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.101
Female, probably in her early 20s.

23:59.167 --> 24:00.401
Pid decomposition

24:00.468 --> 24:02.468
to the microbial activity of the compost pile...

24:02.534 --> 24:06.501
She's been dead about the same time as Curtis.

24:10.501 --> 24:13.501
Dead Frank was fired with another woman£¿

24:17.800 --> 24:21.001
These three phalanges still have some tissue.

24:21.067 --> 24:23.434
And fingernails.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.533
I may be able to get some scrapings,

24:25.600 --> 24:28.234
maybe even a print.

24:28.301 --> 24:31.167
Calliphoridae didn't have a chance to oviposit.

24:31.234 --> 24:33.633
She must have been buried inhe compost

24:33.700 --> 24:35.167
just hours after she died.

24:35.234 --> 24:37.167
Can you pinpoint how long it would take for her

24:37.234 --> 24:38.334
to reach this level of decomp?

24:38.401 --> 24:39.533
Well, given the carbon

24:39.600 --> 24:41.700
to nitrogen ratio of the compost I sampled,

24:41.767 --> 24:44.500
she's been in there since last Wednesday.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.800
Meaning she died the day before Frank?

24:46.867 --> 24:49.500
Who catches two people cheating, but kills them a day apart?

24:49.567 --> 24:51.867
My sketch isn't matching any of the missing women on file.

24:51.934 --> 24:54.167
Well, maybe no one's missed her yet. Poor thing.

24:54.234 --> 24:55.500
Everybody should be missed.

24:55.567 --> 24:57.334
Oh, you are such an angel.

24:57.401 --> 24:58.834
I will get a bucket of cold water, I swear.

24:58.900 --> 25:02.533
There's perimortem trauma to the skull.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.500
But it's not severe enough to cause death.

25:04.567 --> 25:05.767
I also found multiple broken ribs,

25:05.834 --> 25:08.167
and the sternum is severely fractured.

25:08.234 --> 25:09.667
Somebody tried to crush her?

25:09.734 --> 25:14.700
No, these injuries are consistent with inexpert use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

25:14.767 --> 25:17.867
Somebody tried to save her.

25:22.001 --> 25:23.633
The woman you found...

25:23.700 --> 25:25.234
who was she?

25:25.301 --> 25:26.934
Well, we were hoping you might know.

25:27.001 --> 25:28.900
I told you, I was out of town.

25:28.967 --> 25:30.667
I have no idea. But you were aware

25:30.734 --> 25:35.368
that your husband wasn't always faithful.

25:35.434 --> 25:37.234
Yet you stayed with him.

25:37.301 --> 25:38.867
I get it.

25:38.934 --> 25:41.401
Big house, comfortable lifestyle.

25:41.468 --> 25:42.934
I stayed with Frank because I loved him.

25:43.001 --> 25:44.500
I accepted his faults.

25:44.567 --> 25:47.101
I'm sure you'll accept the life insurance money, too.

25:47.167 --> 25:48.867
I'm not even thinking about money, Agent Booth.

25:48.934 --> 25:50.368
How can you even?

25:50.434 --> 25:52.567
My husband hasn't even been dead for a week.

25:52.633 --> 25:53.734
I'm aware of that.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.101
Since you were so forgiving

25:55.167 --> 25:57.001
of your husband's infidelity,

25:57.067 --> 25:59.667
why didn't you mention that in our first conversation?

25:59.734 --> 26:01.234
Kat.

26:01.301 --> 26:04.001
I couldn't do that to our daughter.

26:04.067 --> 26:05.834
She idolized Frank.

26:05.900 --> 26:07.334
I can't ruin that, especially now.

26:07.401 --> 26:08.567
Mom.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.667
Mrs. Curtis, I...

26:11.734 --> 26:13.600
I came over to tell you and Kat

26:13.667 --> 26:15.134
how sorry I am.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.967
Gavin said he'd try to stop over later.

26:19.034 --> 26:20.401
I didn't mean to interrupt.

26:20.468 --> 26:23.700
No, Charlie, it's okay, stay.

26:23.767 --> 26:25.134
Mom, I knew

26:25.201 --> 26:26.867
since high school.

26:26.934 --> 26:28.468
Charlie knew, all my classmates knew.

26:28.533 --> 26:29.700
Oh, God.

26:29.767 --> 26:30.734
Come on, Kat.

26:30.800 --> 26:31.800
Not now.

26:31.867 --> 26:33.334
I pretended that I didn't.

26:34.767 --> 26:37.633
For you.

26:45.867 --> 26:48.468
Okay, so Margie said Frank kept

26:48.533 --> 26:50.067
an office in town.

26:50.134 --> 26:52.167
Turns out that office was an apartment.

26:52.234 --> 26:54.267
Where he took his women.

26:54.334 --> 26:55.633
Yeah, okay, Bones, that's right.

26:55.700 --> 26:57.468
Come on, let's go to the apartment.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.500
You know I used that device on in one of my novels,

27:00.567 --> 27:02.301
and my editor thought it was trite.

27:02.368 --> 27:05.101
Ha! Maybe it was Frank's take on being environmentally friendly,

27:05.167 --> 27:06.867
making a friendly environment.

27:06.934 --> 27:08.001
Get it?

27:08.067 --> 27:09.567
Apparently not.

27:12.034 --> 27:14.134
You know, I really hate these gloves.

27:18.734 --> 27:23.434
No. No sign of forced entry.

27:23.500 --> 27:27.001
These sunglass frames are made of bamboo.

27:27.067 --> 27:28.600
Oh, is that weird?

27:28.667 --> 27:31.800
Well, most frames are made of metal or plastic,

27:31.867 --> 27:33.001
sometimes vinyl.

27:34.234 --> 27:35.967
Maybe they belong to the Eco Avenger.

27:36.034 --> 27:37.134
Who?

27:37.201 --> 27:38.900
Frank. Toiletries in the bathroom,

27:38.967 --> 27:40.533
bra hanging over the shower rod.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.134
Definitely a woman living here.

27:42.201 --> 27:45.201
Dried blood on the coffee table.

27:45.267 --> 27:47.301
Let's call forensics and have the place swept.

27:47.368 --> 27:48.600
Send everything to the...

27:48.667 --> 27:49.967
To the Jeffersonian, yup.

27:50.034 --> 27:51.301
Got it. Including the whole...

27:51.368 --> 27:53.201
Yeah, the entire coffee table.

27:53.267 --> 27:55.301
Here...

27:55.368 --> 27:56.700
Here we go.

27:56.767 --> 27:58.468
Take-out receipt from, uh,

27:58.533 --> 27:59.834
two weeks ago.

27:59.900 --> 28:01.134
Hop Lee's Chinese Kitchen.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.334
Name on the credit card...

28:02.401 --> 28:03.500
Emma Billings.

28:03.567 --> 28:05.201
Booth? Yeah.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.368
I think we found our second victim.

28:08.434 --> 28:10.234
Emma Billings.

28:15.667 --> 28:18.234
She has an interior superior margin fracture

28:18.301 --> 28:19.700
to the C-5 vertebrae.

28:19.767 --> 28:22.867
What about the posterior half of the vertebral body?

28:22.934 --> 28:24.167
Any linked sagittal fractures?

28:24.234 --> 28:25.401
Yes.

28:25.468 --> 28:28.067
So...

28:28.134 --> 28:32.167
if she fell and hit her head on the coffee table

28:32.234 --> 28:33.533
at this angle,

28:33.600 --> 28:35.734
that could account for the broken vertebrae.

28:35.800 --> 28:36.934
It's a statistically rare possibility,

28:37.001 --> 28:38.700
but one that would have killed her instantly.

28:38.767 --> 28:40.600
FBI sent over some info

28:40.667 --> 28:42.034
on our latest victim.

28:42.101 --> 28:44.401
She was a cashier at one of Franklin Curtis's

28:44.468 --> 28:45.767
Natural Sun Markets

28:45.834 --> 28:47.767
in New Jersey. How'd she end up in Virginia?

28:47.834 --> 28:49.267
They think she was hiding.

28:49.334 --> 28:50.900
Earlier this year, she accused

28:50.967 --> 28:53.034
one of her coworkers of stalking her.

28:53.101 --> 28:54.900
Check him out.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.934
Wouldn't want him following me.
I know, right?

28:57.001 --> 28:58.334
Guy's name is Noel Liftan.

28:58.401 --> 28:59.667
He was fired.

28:59.734 --> 29:01.301
Emma filed a restraining order.

29:01.368 --> 29:03.134
Booth is trying to track him down.

29:03.201 --> 29:04.800
Any progress on time of death?

29:04.800 --> 29:05.867
It appears to have been accidental

29:05.867 --> 29:07.867
That'll explain CPR

29:07.867 --> 29:10.067
Frank were stabbed multiple times.

29:10.134 --> 29:11.301
Right. Not so accidental.

29:12.567 --> 29:13.667
Hey, Booth.

29:13.734 --> 29:14.900
What about the murder weapon

29:14.967 --> 29:16.468
used on Frank? Find anything yet?

29:16.533 --> 29:17.667
These puncture wounds...

29:17.734 --> 29:19.267
I still can't find any weapon

29:19.334 --> 29:20.600
this small and curved.

29:20.667 --> 29:21.767
They're close together.

29:21.834 --> 29:23.267
He didn't seem to move much.

29:23.334 --> 29:25.267
Which is odd, because the wounds appear deep.

29:25.334 --> 29:26.567
Okay, call me after.

29:26.633 --> 29:28.001
Booth found Emma's stalker.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.468
He's been staying at a motel

29:29.533 --> 29:31.567
right across the street from where Emma was killed.

29:33.368 --> 29:36.201
Don't look at me like that.

29:36.267 --> 29:38.800
You can't arrest me for renting a motel room.

29:38.867 --> 29:40.800
I didn't break any laws.

29:40.867 --> 29:42.401
I followed her, okay?

29:42.468 --> 29:44.468
But the motel room is over 150 feet

29:44.533 --> 29:45.600
from Emma's apartment building.

29:45.667 --> 29:46.767
I measured. Then

29:46.834 --> 29:48.201
I guess I got no reason to suspect you.

29:48.267 --> 29:49.700
I mean, you were just keeping an eye on her.

29:49.767 --> 29:50.700
I was.

29:51.767 --> 29:52.867
Frank Curtis.

29:52.934 --> 29:55.934
Who? Frank Curtis.

29:56.001 --> 29:57.434
You should talk to him. Okay.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.667
He treated Emma like he owned her.

29:59.734 --> 30:01.834
It was so messed up.

30:03.533 --> 30:05.368
The reflections on this table,

30:05.434 --> 30:07.500
the patterns are beautiful.

30:07.567 --> 30:08.800
Noel.

30:08.867 --> 30:10.800
Focus.

30:10.867 --> 30:12.500
Frank Curtis.

30:12.567 --> 30:14.167
Oh, sure.

30:14.234 --> 30:16.667
Frank comes in for one of his regional visits.

30:16.734 --> 30:18.301
You know, and has the manager hire Emma.

30:18.368 --> 30:19.633
The next time he comes in,

30:19.700 --> 30:21.301
he can see that Emma's falling for me.

30:21.368 --> 30:23.667
So he has me fired and then tells Emma

30:23.734 --> 30:25.201
to take out a restraining order.

30:25.267 --> 30:27.301
The fact that you called her 20 times a day

30:27.368 --> 30:29.067
and slept in her driveway, that had nothing

30:29.134 --> 30:30.368
to do with it?

30:30.434 --> 30:32.167
I guess you've never been in love.

30:33.633 --> 30:35.500
Where were you last Wednesday and Thursday?

30:35.567 --> 30:38.001
Mostly I just stay in my motel room,

30:38.067 --> 30:39.667
you know, keep an eye on Emma's building.

30:39.734 --> 30:43.267
Only times I ever leave is to go out and sell my products.

30:43.334 --> 30:44.934
Your products?

30:45.001 --> 30:48.134
Hemp oil-based body products.

30:48.201 --> 30:49.700
I make them myself.

30:49.767 --> 30:51.067
There's a surprise.

30:51.134 --> 30:53.034
I guess you're telling me you don't have an alibi.

30:59.001 --> 31:01.167
I reviewed the forensic samples from the apartment.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.633
Traces of triglycerides, diglycerides,

31:03.700 --> 31:06.667
and free fatty acids on both the carpeting and the furniture.

31:06.734 --> 31:09.201
It looks like some vegetable oil.

31:09.267 --> 31:10.934
Could it be hemp oil?

31:11.001 --> 31:13.134
Booth said the person stalking Emma Billings

31:13.201 --> 31:15.867
sells hemp-based body products.

31:15.934 --> 31:17.567
Yeah, that's one possibility.

31:17.633 --> 31:19.767
Re-examine any clothing from Frank and Emma's bodies.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.600
- See if you can find additional traces of the oil. - Okay.

31:22.667 --> 31:26.301
Dr. Brennan,

31:27.900 --> 31:30.034
Fracturing to Emma's sternum I concealed a malformation

31:30.101 --> 31:32.301
that became apparent once I finished reconstruction.

31:32.368 --> 31:34.267
A sternal feramin.

31:34.334 --> 31:35.967
Emma Billings and Frank Curtis

31:36.034 --> 31:38.267
both shared a congenital abnormality.

31:38.334 --> 31:39.633
When Zach told me his findings,

31:39.700 --> 31:41.167
I decided to run DNA tests

31:41.234 --> 31:43.067
on the tissue samples from both victims.

31:43.134 --> 31:45.067
Multiple matching RFLPs.

31:45.134 --> 31:47.234
Our victims were related.

31:47.301 --> 31:49.967
If our murderer thought he killed Emma and her lover,

31:50.034 --> 31:52.867
- he was very wrong. - He killed emma and her father

31:59.601 --> 32:01.033
I've tested over 40 different knives,

32:01.100 --> 32:02.667
ice picks, leather awls.

32:02.734 --> 32:04.300
I couldn't find a murder weapon to match.

32:04.367 --> 32:06.567
Well, with decomp and postmortem trauma

32:06.634 --> 32:07.834
from being rolled down the hill,

32:07.901 --> 32:09.234
it's very difficult, Zach.

32:09.300 --> 32:12.868
Okay, this will help you visualize the pattern
of the wounds.

32:12.934 --> 32:14.133
Usually I can determine the weapon.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.701
This is a very frustrating murderer.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.534
I'm sure he'll apologize when we catch him.

32:17.601 --> 32:20.534
There are five puncture wounds to Frank's chest.

32:20.601 --> 32:22.634
The result of repeated stabs

32:22.701 --> 32:25.267
by an unknown and very frustrating object.

32:25.334 --> 32:26.634
Perhaps not.

32:26.701 --> 32:29.801
What if Frank Curtis had broader shoulders?

32:29.868 --> 32:32.467
Angela, move the scapuli apart

32:32.534 --> 32:34.067
slowly.

32:34.133 --> 32:36.334
A little more.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.634
The wounds become equidistant.

32:38.701 --> 32:40.634
You're probably looking for an instrument

32:40.701 --> 32:43.868
with multiple sharp pointed objects projecting from it.

32:43.934 --> 32:45.334
A pitchfork.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.200
How'd you get pitchfork?

32:47.267 --> 32:49.033
These three wounds mark the termination

32:49.100 --> 32:51.033
of a three-tine pitchfork's penetration.

32:51.100 --> 32:52.901
Makes sense.

32:52.968 --> 32:55.968
I'll go match the exact type and make.

32:57.267 --> 32:58.834
I've got results from the clothes.

32:58.901 --> 32:59.934
You were right.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.267
Same vegetable oil

33:01.334 --> 33:02.734
on both Frank and Emma's clothing.

33:02.801 --> 33:06.667
But I found a high concentration of methanol and sodium hydroxide mixed in.

33:06.734 --> 33:09.767
So, the oil isn't from body products.

33:09.834 --> 33:11.601
No, it's from bio-diesel fuel.

33:19.634 --> 33:23.601
So your suspect is going to give me a description of your suspect?

33:23.667 --> 33:24.834
I m not following.

33:24.901 --> 33:26.100
Yeah, the stoned hippie guy.

33:26.167 --> 33:27.434
He's all we have so far.

33:27.501 --> 33:29.501
I mean, he'll tell you what the guy looks like

33:29.567 --> 33:31.434
who went into Emma's place and then you draw.

33:31.501 --> 33:34.434
I've never really found stoned guys that dependable.

33:34.501 --> 33:36.267
Except for cookies.

33:37.334 --> 33:38.734
They always have good cookies.

33:38.801 --> 33:40.300
You're grasping at straws, Booth.

33:40.367 --> 33:41.701
We should wait for more information.

33:41.767 --> 33:43.734
It has to be somebody in the composting facility.

33:43.801 --> 33:46.634
Uh, they have pitchforks to turn the heaps, don't they?

33:46.701 --> 33:48.801
Pitchforks are used on every farm in the area.

33:48.868 --> 33:49.834
But not bio-diesel, okay?

33:49.901 --> 33:50.868
The owner, Gavin,

33:50.934 --> 33:52.300
said he just replaced a fuel pump

33:52.367 --> 33:54.167
on his truck when he switched to bio-diesel.

33:54.234 --> 33:55.734
One of the other farmers also said

33:55.801 --> 33:56.868
that he just switched.

33:56.934 --> 33:58.100
And he has a key,

33:58.167 --> 33:59.501
he could've dumped the body the middle of the night

33:59.567 --> 34:00.934
I'm sorry, but whose side are you on?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.634
Uh, don't say the facts,

34:02.701 --> 34:03.767
because that just annoys me.

34:03.834 --> 34:06.901
You want us to base our actions on your gut again?

34:06.968 --> 34:08.100
Yes.

34:08.167 --> 34:10.467
You have your shiny machines, I have my gut.

34:10.534 --> 34:13.300
Is it always like this when you two are together?

34:13.367 --> 34:14.601
- Yes. - No.

34:14.667 --> 34:15.934
It's kind of hot.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.367
What the hell is he doing?

34:31.934 --> 34:33.934
It's a Vedic chant.

34:35.234 --> 34:37.367
All right, Noel,

34:37.434 --> 34:38.667
let's go, on your feet.

34:38.734 --> 34:39.934
A bass player taught it to me.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.400
I'm trying to calm myself, man.

34:41.467 --> 34:42.900
Emma's dead and I'm innocent.

34:42.967 --> 34:45.033
How many times do I have to tell you that?

34:46.734 --> 34:48.100
All right, you know, Noel-

34:48.167 --> 34:50.534
Just want to ask you some more questions, that's all.

34:50.601 --> 34:53.100
Who are the chicks?

34:53.167 --> 34:55.000
Hey, be respectful, be a gentleman.

34:55.067 --> 34:56.467
Let's go, up, up, up...

34:56.534 --> 34:57.667
Come on. There you go.

34:57.734 --> 34:59.701
That's it, okay.

34:59.767 --> 35:01.734
This here is Dr. Brennan.

35:01.801 --> 35:03.968
Angela Montenegro, she's an artist.

35:04.033 --> 35:05.033
- Cool. - Yeah, groovy.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.634
Did you see a truck

35:06.701 --> 35:09.834
parked outside Emma's apartment building last Wednesday?

35:09.901 --> 35:10.868
How would I know?

35:10.934 --> 35:12.601
I mean, it's not like I kept a log

35:12.667 --> 35:14.300
of everyone going in and out of the building.

35:14.367 --> 35:16.367
Listen, Noel, you're the primary suspect in Emma's murder.

35:16.434 --> 35:17.501
So if you do not cooperate,

35:17.567 --> 35:19.167
you're looking at 20 solid years

35:19.234 --> 35:20.567
keeping tabs on your cell mate.

35:20.634 --> 35:23.567
All right, fine.

35:23.634 --> 35:25.901
I remember a truck,

35:25.968 --> 35:29.734
it had a cool logo from some organic composting place.

35:29.801 --> 35:32.200
We need to know who was driving the truck

35:32.267 --> 35:34.367
and if he went in to Emma's building.

35:34.434 --> 35:36.234
What, you think I have bionic vision or something?

35:36.300 --> 35:37.367
No, but you got binoculars...

35:37.434 --> 35:38.667
they're in every starter stalker kit...

35:38.734 --> 35:41.400
so give Angela something to draw.

35:41.467 --> 35:43.534
I like artists.

35:44.801 --> 35:47.868
I'll crush you like a bug, dude.

35:47.934 --> 35:49.334
Describe the guy.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.200
Uh, he's a young dude, maybe 26,

35:52.267 --> 35:54.100
about my height,
average,

35:54.167 --> 35:56.667
kind of buff, Caucasian,

35:56.734 --> 35:57.968
uh, brown hair,

35:58.033 --> 35:59.434
he was wearing sunglasses.

35:59.501 --> 36:02.167
Kind of looked like they were made out of wood or something.

36:02.234 --> 36:04.167
Far out, huh?

36:04.234 --> 36:05.567
Wood.

36:07.200 --> 36:10.934
Hey, do you guys have medical marijuana in DC?

36:11.968 --> 36:13.434
Because I get anxiety attacks.

36:13.501 --> 36:16.000
Give Angela something to draw.

36:20.734 --> 36:24.000
Um... he had a, uh,

36:24.067 --> 36:27.000
square jaw, um, straight nose,

36:27.067 --> 36:28.901
cute ears.

36:31.567 --> 36:33.968
Charlie Rogan got 'em from Frank Curtis.

36:34.033 --> 36:35.567
Y? What's going on?

36:35.634 --> 36:37.534
Why did Frank give Charlie a pair of sunglasses?

36:37.601 --> 36:40.634
No real reason-Frank wore 'em one day to pick up compost,

36:40.701 --> 36:42.701
Charlie admired 'em, so Frank gave 'em to him.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.267
He was like that. Can you think

36:44.334 --> 36:46.667
of any reason why Charlie would want Frank dead?

36:46.734 --> 36:49.400
Of course not-he's a good kid; he loved Frank.

36:49.467 --> 36:50.968
This is the murder weapon.

36:51.033 --> 36:52.300
- There you go. - Bag it.

36:52.367 --> 36:54.334
It seems like Charlie and Frank had

36:54.400 --> 36:55.968
a thing for the same girl.

36:56.033 --> 36:56.968
Charlie gets jealous,

36:57.033 --> 36:59.501
he gets into a fight with the girl,

36:59.567 --> 37:01.834
kills her, and then he goes after Frank's story.

37:01.901 --> 37:03.734
As old as time, my compost friend.

37:03.801 --> 37:06.601
- Need something, Gavin? -Yeah. Charles Rogan,

37:06.667 --> 37:09.634
- you're under arrest for the murder of Frank Curtis and Emma Billings. - Oh, God, no.

37:09.701 --> 37:10.767
Th-This isn't what you think!

37:10.834 --> 37:12.300
Gavin, I didn't...

37:12.367 --> 37:14.267
- I swear I didn't... - Don't.

37:14.334 --> 37:15.968
Don't say a word, Charlie.

37:16.033 --> 37:17.334
Gavin...

37:17.400 --> 37:19.434
Cam, we've got the murder weapon used on Frank Curtis,

37:19.501 --> 37:22.100
plus evidence linking Charlie to the scene of Emma's murder.

37:22.167 --> 37:24.801
Yeah, well, I hate to throw ants in your picnic,

37:24.868 --> 37:27.634
but I recovered DNA from beneath Emma's fingernails...

37:27.701 --> 37:29.734
Charlie Rogan didn't attack Emma Billings.

37:29.801 --> 37:32.033
- Her assailant was female. - What is it?

37:32.100 --> 37:33.801
- Charlie didn't kill Emma. - What? He was there.

37:33.868 --> 37:35.133
But there's more.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.501
I noticed some odd similarities,

37:36.567 --> 37:39.434
so I compared Emma's own DNA to that of her attacker.

37:39.501 --> 37:41.601
There was a 25% commonality.

37:41.667 --> 37:43.167
Half sisters.

37:46.534 --> 37:49.734
It was Cat Curtis- she killed Emma.

37:51.200 --> 37:54.801
My father promised he'd stop fooling around.

37:54.868 --> 37:57.734
My mother was so humiliated.

37:57.801 --> 38:00.501
So you went to Emma.

38:01.868 --> 38:04.734
I had the key.

38:04.801 --> 38:06.734
I was waiting for her.

38:06.801 --> 38:08.734
I scared her, I guess.

38:08.801 --> 38:10.133
And you fought.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.200
She fell.

38:13.567 --> 38:15.467
I never meant to hurt her.

38:15.534 --> 38:18.601
I just, I wanted my dad to end things.

38:18.667 --> 38:21.434
It just looked like she bumped her head.

38:21.501 --> 38:23.133
But she was dead.

38:24.567 --> 38:26.501
Cat called.

38:26.567 --> 38:28.133
We were still friends.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.334
I knew she'd never hurt anyone.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.033
It was an accident.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.367
So you told Cat

38:33.434 --> 38:35.200
you'd get rid of Emma's body

38:35.267 --> 38:37.567
while her and her mother went out of town.

38:37.634 --> 38:38.734
But you leave your sunglasses.

38:38.801 --> 38:40.767
It's not like I'd done this before.

38:40.834 --> 38:42.767
And Frank sees them the next time he goes to visit Emma.

38:42.834 --> 38:44.934
He came at me, man, one night at work.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.334
Frank went nuts.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.200
Wanted to know why I was at his place,

38:49.267 --> 38:50.734
where Emma was.

38:50.801 --> 38:52.534
He had a pitchfork.

38:52.601 --> 38:54.701
I was turning the compost when he was yelling at me.

38:54.767 --> 38:57.234
He knew what would happen to you and Kat if you found out.

38:57.300 --> 38:59.801
He came at me.

38:59.868 --> 39:02.701
I didn't even know I'd done it.

39:02.767 --> 39:05.901
It was like someone else jabbed him with it.

39:05.968 --> 39:08.734
But the body, Charlie, why'd you move Frank's body?

39:08.801 --> 39:11.968
For my mom, for the insurance.

39:12.033 --> 39:13.400
Of course, no payout without a body.

39:13.467 --> 39:16.133
So I tossed him where we knew he'd be found.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.467
Dad left everything to nonprofits.

39:17.534 --> 39:20.067
That insurance money was all my mom would have.

39:20.133 --> 39:21.534
You did it for your mother?

39:21.601 --> 39:23.534
I never meant for any of this to happen.

39:23.601 --> 39:26.033
I never meant to hurt anyone, I just...

39:26.100 --> 39:28.567
I wanted my mom to be happy.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.901
Kat...

39:30.968 --> 39:33.534
your father wasn't having an affair with Emma.

39:35.133 --> 39:40.567
He'd had a relationship with her mother a long time ago.

39:40.634 --> 39:43.501
Emma Billings was his daughter.

39:43.567 --> 39:48.067
She was your half sister.

39:48.133 --> 39:51.801
What? Oh, my God.

39:51.868 --> 39:54.000
Oh, my God, no.

39:54.067 --> 39:56.000
Oh, my God, no!

40:04.734 --> 40:06.667
So, case finished?

40:06.734 --> 40:10.133
- Yes. - Congratulations.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.701
Yeah.

40:11.767 --> 40:13.133
You don't seem too happy.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.133
Well, because sometimes, if you win,

40:15.200 --> 40:17.334
you end up with somebody else's pain

40:17.400 --> 40:19.767
and screwed-up life.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.667
You work for the FBI, you should know that.

40:22.734 --> 40:25.868
Must be a challenge for you to access those feelings.

40:25.934 --> 40:27.367
Okay, stop.

40:27.434 --> 40:28.534
You don't know Booth.

40:28.601 --> 40:30.267
You don't know me, you have a limited

40:30.334 --> 40:32.167
view of us based on superficial data

40:32.234 --> 40:34.534
you've accumulated on a standardized questionnaire,

40:34.601 --> 40:36.901
and a subjective analysis from talking to us

40:36.968 --> 40:38.667
that is not at all scientific,

40:38.734 --> 40:40.968
so back off.

40:41.033 --> 40:42.667
Just trying to help.

40:42.734 --> 40:44.067
By questioning his humanity?

40:44.133 --> 40:46.200
Okay, Bones, now you're going a little bit overboard.

40:46.267 --> 40:47.634
He's just a kid. Right?

40:47.701 --> 40:49.934
I mean, the worst thing that's probably ever happened to him

40:50.000 --> 40:52.667
was he lost at Mortal Kombat.

40:52.734 --> 40:54.868
Are you normally this protective of him, Dr. Brennan?

40:54.934 --> 40:57.067
We are partners.

40:57.133 --> 41:00.467
Our lives depend on being protective of each other.

41:00.534 --> 41:03.400
And you feel the same way, Agent Booth?

41:03.467 --> 41:05.467
Sweets, I can only hope
that one day you know

41:05.534 --> 41:07.667
what a real partnership is.

41:07.734 --> 41:09.534
You two are very close,

41:09.601 --> 41:12.100
that was evident in your superficial,

41:12.167 --> 41:13.767
standardized questionnaire

41:13.834 --> 41:16.200
and my unscientific observations.

41:16.267 --> 41:17.601
Yeah?

41:17.667 --> 41:20.033
You complement each other.

41:20.100 --> 41:22.767
No, she never compliments me.

41:22.834 --> 41:24.234
Did you compliment me in the questionnaire?

41:24.300 --> 41:27.100
"Complement," not "compliment."

41:27.167 --> 41:29.033
"Ple."

41:29.100 --> 41:32.767
He means that we complete each other, as a team.

41:34.601 --> 41:35.968
Yeah, right.

41:36.033 --> 41:38.367
Now, we've got a lot to work on over the next few months.

41:39.734 --> 41:42.033
Meaning we get to stay together?

41:42.100 --> 41:43.567
Yes.

41:43.634 --> 41:44.567
I'm sensing a "but."

41:44.634 --> 41:46.701
- However, -It's the same as "but."

41:46.767 --> 41:50.400
I have observed some underlying issues

41:50.467 --> 41:52.033
that need to be addressed.

41:52.100 --> 41:54.033
- Issues? - Yes.

41:54.100 --> 41:57.567
There's clearly a very deep

41:57.634 --> 41:59.968
emotional attachment between you two.

42:00.033 --> 42:02.567
We're just partners.

42:02.634 --> 42:05.400
And why do you think I would have thought otherwise?

42:05.467 --> 42:07.167
'Cause you'r12.

42:07.234 --> 42:09.467
Don't read into anything that Booth said.

42:09.534 --> 42:10.901
We're professionals.

42:10.968 --> 42:13.367
There's a line that doesn't even need to be there.

42:13.434 --> 42:14.434
Not at all, I mean,

42:14.501 --> 42:16.934
if there were no more murders,

42:17.000 --> 42:20.567
I would probably not even, you know, see her.

42:20.634 --> 42:22.033
That's very true.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.300
Might have coffee.

42:23.367 --> 42:26.067
- Probably not. - What?

42:26.133 --> 42:28.300
What?

42:29.667 --> 42:32.634
You wouldn't even have coffee with me?

42:32.701 --> 42:36.200
Well, in your scenario,
we wouldn't even

42:36.267 --> 42:38.501
know each other because there are no murders.

42:38.567 --> 42:43.067
Were. I said "no more murders."

42:43.133 --> 42:45.434
Then fine.

42:45.501 --> 42:47.634
I mean, we could have a coffee.

42:49.834 --> 42:51.467
So that's clear, then?

42:51.534 --> 42:53.033
I mean, we'd have coffee

42:53.100 --> 42:54.767
and that's our relationship?

42:54.834 --> 42:56.467
Coffee.

42:56.534 --> 42:58.934
Yeah, let's move on.
