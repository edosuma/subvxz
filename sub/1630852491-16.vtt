WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.970
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.104 --> 00:05.573
Every morning at 6:45,

00:05.706 --> 00:08.209
I am the first thing she sees
when she wakes up.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.877
Let's get you out of bed.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.745
And it grounds her.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.548
In the event that Miguel,
God forbid, is not here

00:14.682 --> 00:16.750
to make decisions for me,
I'm gonna need one of you

00:16.884 --> 00:18.486
to stand in for him.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.889
Kate. I want it to be you.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.593
-* Little darling *
-(baby crying over monitor)

00:25.726 --> 00:29.530
-* It's been a long,
cold, lonely winter *
-Jack.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.600
-* Little darling... *
-(snoring)

00:32.733 --> 00:36.003
Come on, I've been up six times
already.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.939
-Can you please go?
-(crying continues)

00:39.073 --> 00:42.476
-* Here comes the sun *
-Jack.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.578
-* Here comes the sun... *
-Mommy's here.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.247
Daddy couldn't make it.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.615
* It's all right *

00:47.748 --> 00:50.017
(crying)

00:50.151 --> 00:51.852
REBECCA:
Okay, okay.

00:51.985 --> 00:55.089
Oh, Kevin. You woke up Randall.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.857
(groans)

00:56.990 --> 00:59.093
Your sister's not crying.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.295
(crying continues louder)

01:02.563 --> 01:04.298
KATE:
Mom, I had a bad dream.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.299
Hmm?

01:05.433 --> 01:07.034
* Since it's been here *

01:07.168 --> 01:09.803
(sighs) Was it about gremlins?

01:09.937 --> 01:12.173
-* Here comes the sun... *
-Okay.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.642
Kate, sweetheart,
they are not real.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.510
Can I have waffles?

01:16.644 --> 01:19.180
It's 5:00 a.m., Kate.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.848
-(scoffs)
-* It's all right... *

01:20.981 --> 01:22.850
Now, what are you guys doing
in here?

01:22.983 --> 01:26.220
Kate woke us up 'cause she has
a bad dream about gremlins,

01:26.354 --> 01:28.189
and now we're scared, too.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.357
Can we have waffles?

01:29.490 --> 01:31.525
(sighs)

01:31.659 --> 01:33.627
Yes, we can all have waffles.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.729
* Sun, sun, sun... *

01:35.863 --> 01:37.998
I'm gonna go make waffles.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.203
* Little darling *

01:42.336 --> 01:44.672
-RANDALL: Mom.
-* I feel that I... *

01:44.805 --> 01:46.640
-Randall? What-What's wrong?
-I need you to sign

01:46.774 --> 01:49.076
my permission slip
for the debate tournament today.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.812
It's-it's 4:30 in the morning.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.482
And the bus leaves
for the debate at 6:00,

01:54.615 --> 01:56.083
so please hurry.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.951
* Here comes the sun *

02:00.354 --> 02:01.989
-Thank you.
-* Here comes the sun *

02:02.122 --> 02:04.024
* And I say *

02:04.158 --> 02:06.194
-* It's all right *
-(footsteps departing)

02:06.327 --> 02:07.995
-* It's all right... *
-KATE: Randall!

02:08.128 --> 02:10.764
It is the literal
ass crack of dawn!

02:10.898 --> 02:13.301
Can you not walk so loud?!

02:19.240 --> 02:21.041
(insects chirping)

02:22.543 --> 02:23.977
Miguel?

02:30.351 --> 02:31.819
Miguel?

02:34.755 --> 02:37.391
(groans)

02:37.525 --> 02:38.859
Miguel?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.028
-Miguel?
-Ms. Pearson.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.563
-It's okay.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.232
-Who are you?
-You're okay. I'm your nurse.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.033
-Where-Where's Miguel?
-It's okay.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.601
-I want Miguel. I need Miguel.
-Okay.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.137
Hey, Mom. You're okay.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.272
Why won't this woman
tell me where Miguel is?

02:51.405 --> 02:52.340
Where is Miguel?

02:53.641 --> 02:56.043
-KATE: He's not here right now.
-REBECCA: Where is he?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.546
-I got it. Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.381
-(Rebecca scoffs)
-Oh, Mom.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.750
(whispers):
Can we get you back in bed, Mom?

03:02.883 --> 03:05.085
-Thank you.
-REBECCA: Where is Miguel?

03:08.589 --> 03:09.657
Can one of you help
with the pillow?

03:09.790 --> 03:11.359
Yeah.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.395
* *

03:23.737 --> 03:25.273
Okay. There you go.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.576
You need your rest,

03:28.709 --> 03:30.944
'cause tomorrow we're gonna have
a fun, beautiful day.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.581
Where is Miguel?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.594
* *

03:52.666 --> 03:54.835
Good morning.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.470
-Hey.
-Anybody get any sleep
last night?

03:56.604 --> 03:58.706
-Not a wink.
-No.
-Okay.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.474
(fridge opens)

04:00.608 --> 04:02.510
How much longer do you think
she's gonna be like this?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.011
Waking up, asking for Miguel?

04:04.144 --> 04:07.615
I mean, it's only been a week
since he's been gone.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.182
Laila said it's gonna take time.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.319
Has anybody seen Sophie?

04:11.452 --> 04:12.486
I got out of the shower,
and she was already gone.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.154
She went into town for bagels

04:14.288 --> 04:16.123
with Beth and Philip.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.959
Beth said all this sadness
called for some carbs.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.328
-(door closes)
-NICKY: All right, let's go!

04:20.461 --> 04:22.363
All right, everybody peed?

04:22.496 --> 04:25.065
All right, Edie and I have
an action day planned

04:25.198 --> 04:27.368
of Poconos fun,
so we don't have any time

04:27.501 --> 04:30.738
to be waylaid
by little tiny bladders.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.340
-Go pee. Come on, guys.
-Come on. Out.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.542
-Go pee. Go quickly.
-Go pee.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.043
-ELIJAH: Come on.
-Franny, you peed?

04:36.176 --> 04:37.345
Yes.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.846
Are you lying?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.648
-Yes.
-NICKY: Yeah.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.550
(laughter)

04:44.785 --> 04:46.820
Thank you for letting us
air the kids out today,

04:46.954 --> 04:48.889
-showing us around.
-Oh, it's our pleasure.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.091
-We really love this town.
-It's true. It's true.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.727
And that cabin is
the best place I've ever lived.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.364
That said,
before that I lived in

04:56.497 --> 04:58.699
a rusted-out trailer
and in a Vietnam war zone.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.233
-Yep, that'll do it.
-Great, wow.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.935
-(laughs)
-Okay, we got-- Come on, guys.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.170
-Let's go.
-All right, let's go.
-Bye-bye.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.605
-Let's go. See you guys later.
-All right.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.173
-All right, be good. Have fun.
-(overlapping goodbyes)

05:06.306 --> 05:07.875
-ELIJAH: Have a great day.
-Bye.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.544
(departing chatter)

05:10.678 --> 05:12.513
-(takes deep breath)
-(door closes)

05:12.646 --> 05:16.283
Okay. So, everyone 100% has to
go back to real life on Monday?

05:16.417 --> 05:19.453
I have the series finale
Manny table read.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.390
Mmm. How many Mannys is that
total? 200, 300?

05:22.523 --> 05:24.358
-Too many.
Don't want to talk about it.
-KATE: Wow. Exciting.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.726
KEVIN (chuckles):
Don't want to talk about it.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.761
-KATE: I'm swamped at work.
-KEVIN: Mm.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.563
Toby and Laura, they've been
so good about watching the kids,

05:29.697 --> 05:31.399
but I'd kind of like
to see my children.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.033
KEVIN:
Fair enough.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.070
Um...

05:40.741 --> 05:41.842
I do think we need to have
a family meeting.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.012
Come up with a plan for Mom.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.449
Uh, we have a plan for Mom.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.884
The plan was...

05:51.018 --> 05:52.753
I built this house,
that-that was the plan.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.156
And-and it served her well
for many years.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.058
But Miguel is gone now,

05:58.191 --> 05:59.627
and we can't just leave her
all alone here.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.395
-Right?
-No. Well, she's not alone,
though.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.763
She's got Laila, right?

06:02.896 --> 06:03.897
We can get another house aide.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.065
But aides aren't enough.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.299
She needs family.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.235
Of course she needs family.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.638
And when The Manny is done,
I will be here.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.406
Twice a month.
I'll be here every other week,

06:12.540 --> 06:14.341
-like clockwork.
-RANDALL: So she'll have
a family member here

06:14.475 --> 06:16.343
every other week
for, like, the weekend?

06:16.477 --> 06:17.845
I mean, you two are gonna visit,
too, right?

06:17.978 --> 06:19.146
It's not enough, Kev.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.581
I don't understand

06:20.714 --> 06:21.515
why you're acting so surprised,
Randall.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.150
This was always the plan.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.785
Can you please tell him
that this was always the plan?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.321
Kate?

06:31.825 --> 06:33.694
Do you not think
that Mom should stay here?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.228
In the place that she knows?

06:37.064 --> 06:39.867
I think that we should have
a family meeting.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.602
Hey, morning, guys!
I'll tell you what.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.604
They have the best coffee
in this town.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.073
It's like this new variety
of beans that...

06:48.408 --> 06:50.844
-Oh, boy.
-Did I say something?

06:50.978 --> 06:52.780
No, it's not you.
I'm "oh, boy-ing" these three.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.347
They're finally having

06:54.482 --> 06:56.049
the "What's next
with our mother" chat.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.818
How could you possibly know
what we were talking about?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.453
What were you talking about,
Kev?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.354
Having the "What's next
for our mom" talk.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.556
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow, you're good.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.891
She really is.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.859
I really am.
So, here's what's up.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.961
Um, you guys are gonna stay here

07:08.095 --> 07:10.063
and go through
your Pearson process, like,

07:10.197 --> 07:12.966
feel all your feelings and
hash out a plan for your mom.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.969
I'm gonna take your better
halves down to the cabin,

07:16.103 --> 07:20.708
post up and enjoy
this beautiful day away...

07:20.841 --> 07:22.275
from this energy.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.478
Capisce?

07:24.612 --> 07:26.079
-Capisce.
-Capisce.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.915
Great.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.917
Sophie, Philip, to the cabin.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.886
-Capisce.
-No, Philip. No.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.225
Well, you heard the woman.
Let's talk.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.393
* *

07:51.338 --> 07:53.507
(phone ringing)

07:57.477 --> 07:58.879
-(phone beeps)
-Hello?

08:04.251 --> 08:05.485
Okay.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.857
(groans) Denise, I'm so sorry.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.926
Rebecca, please.
You don't have to apologize.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.928
The month you've had, I...

08:15.062 --> 08:18.098
-I'm so, so sorry about Jack.
-Thank you.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.701
Hey. You three.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.170
Car. Now. Let's go.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.139
Randall,
what happened to your lip?

08:26.273 --> 08:28.441
Marty Harris's fist. (chuckles)

08:32.780 --> 08:35.082
-Is anyone else starving?
-Not funny.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.084
Get in the car.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.955
So, what happened?

08:42.089 --> 08:44.157
Kev took us to the party
and got Kate drunk.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.126
And then...

08:46.259 --> 08:47.795
I heard these two idiot guys

08:47.928 --> 08:48.929
talking about
what Kate was wearing.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.664
And then one of them said

08:50.798 --> 08:52.432
he was gonna ask her
to go for a walk

08:52.566 --> 08:54.534
and... and get her to, you know.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.805
And did she go on the walk?

08:57.938 --> 09:00.273
No.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.909
He never got
the chance to ask her.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.614
(sighs)

09:06.747 --> 09:07.715
Thank you, Randall.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.051
Thank God for you.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.656
(plate slides on countertop)

09:15.789 --> 09:18.992
KEVIN:
Tell you what,
I have lived in New York,

09:19.126 --> 09:20.761
and I swear
this Podunk town has

09:20.894 --> 09:21.995
the best Chinese food
I've ever had.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.698
I'm with you, bro.
China Café for life.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.433
-(Kevin chuckles)
-All right.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.635
-KEVIN: Hmm.
-Should we start?

09:29.770 --> 09:31.605
-Okay, look, I...
-KEVIN: I was...

09:32.906 --> 09:33.674
-I think...
-Well, I was just thinking
if-if...

09:33.807 --> 09:35.275
-You want to...
-You.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.144
You know, I have an idea.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.613
All right, so...

09:41.615 --> 09:44.317
Whoever is holding this
gets to talk.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.886
What in the hell is that?

09:46.019 --> 09:48.856
It's a therapy cat.
I just got it for Mom.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.891
On the website, it says
that lifelike toys

09:51.024 --> 09:53.727
help Alzheimer's patients to
feel, like, a sense of purpose.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.829
Brings them back to
a time where they,

09:55.963 --> 09:56.997
you know,
could take care of something.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.365
So she can pet it,
she can take care of it.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.967
Kill me. Kill me now.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.534
Not until you kill me first,
please.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.470
Guys.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.906
Come on. Who wants to go first?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.141
You know what,
senators before celebrities.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.977
-(chuckles)
-Come on. Take the kitty.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.879
(groans) "Take the kitty."
All right.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.347
-Oh, stop.
-RANDALL: Yeah. Okay.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.817
Okay.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.054
Oh, wow.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.023
This place really is
a time capsule, isn't it?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.925
Tell me about it.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.493
I found my Tommy Girl perfume
in the bathroom.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.729
(laughs)

10:28.862 --> 10:30.864
I think we should go
back to the house. Maybe...

10:30.998 --> 10:33.333
I don't know,
maybe we could be of some help.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.503
Oh, dear, sweet, naive Philip.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.072
We can't help those three.
Nobody can.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.741
-SOPHIE: Mm-hmm.
-(sets bottle down)

10:40.874 --> 10:46.113
Miguel's been gone
seven days now, and...

10:46.246 --> 10:49.516
that's seven days for
my husband's mind to spin out

10:49.649 --> 10:52.219
and try to figure out
what to do next with his mother.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.688
To gather his thoughts

10:54.822 --> 10:57.557
and then present his case
to his siblings.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.895
Well, Miguel was her family.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.496
And he was our man
on the ground.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.968
And we could justify
just dropping in for visits

11:08.101 --> 11:10.137
as our schedules allowed
as long as he was by her side,

11:10.270 --> 11:12.773
but... not anymore.

11:15.275 --> 11:18.979
I've been thinking about this
a lot for the last few days,

11:19.112 --> 11:21.114
and I think she should move in
with me.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.816
He's gonna want to
move her to Philly.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.785
(groans)

11:24.918 --> 11:25.753
That's gonna get Kevin
all riled up.

11:25.886 --> 11:26.787
(scoffs) You know it.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.289
SOPHIE:
Ah, and thus will begin

11:29.422 --> 11:32.525
the classic "Who is the better
man and son" pissing contest.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.964
(as Randall):
"She's our mother, Kev.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.667
"She has cared for us
our entire lives,

11:40.801 --> 11:42.669
"and now it's our turn
to care for her.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.805
Because she's our mother, Kev."

11:44.938 --> 11:46.740
(as Kevin):
"Oh, really? Really, Randall?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.341
"Well, thank you,
thank you for telling me

11:48.475 --> 11:49.576
"that our mother is our mother.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.178
"You know,
I built this house for her

11:51.311 --> 11:52.612
with my bare hands."

11:52.746 --> 11:55.182
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow. Wow, that's great.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.316
You two should take this
on the road.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.786
-Ah, thank you.
-We really should.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.988
Well, Kate's there.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.555
It's gonna be fine.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.560
What?

12:09.897 --> 12:11.999
-(knocking)
-Come in.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.603
You'll feel better
in the morning.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.512
I don't think I've seen you
wear that much makeup before.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.615
(sighs)

12:28.748 --> 12:30.183
Say what you want to say, Mom.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.455
You're young
and you're figuring it out.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.756
There's nothing wrong with that.

12:39.092 --> 12:43.130
But I do need you to know
that you have so much to offer.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.532
So when you go out
in the world...

12:47.000 --> 12:48.635
...I really hope you know that.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.505
Look.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.174
Two out of three isn't bad.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.743
Take the win.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.279
-What do you mean?
-Your kids.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.850
Two winners, one dud.

13:02.983 --> 13:03.984
Kind of like Hanson.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.889
The way you see me,

13:09.022 --> 13:11.158
the way...

13:11.291 --> 13:13.526
the way Dad saw me...

13:15.295 --> 13:16.496
You're wrong about me.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.369
KEVIN:
Randall, you're in D.C.,
what, like three days a week?

13:22.502 --> 13:23.770
Working till about 10:00.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.873
Beth's schedule is
just as insane as yours.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.574
How is moving to Philly
better for Mom?

13:27.707 --> 13:28.942
RANDALL:
It'll be better
'cause I'll be there.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.443
KEVIN:
Am I in The Twilight Zone
right now?

13:30.577 --> 13:31.744
What do you mean you'll be...?
You won't be there.

13:31.879 --> 13:34.181
I will be, man.
I will figure it out.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.783
Ka-Kate, you're Mom's guardian.
You have the final say.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.751
Do you have any thoughts
on Randall ripping Mom

13:38.886 --> 13:40.287
out of the house
and moving her to Philadelphia,

13:40.420 --> 13:41.654
just so she can sit alone
in the town house all day?

13:43.223 --> 13:44.591
W-- I don't know,

13:44.724 --> 13:46.359
but I think that we should
keep talking about it.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.395
She won't be alone, Kevin.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.897
I will find her
a full-time aide.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.532
She was very clear about
what she wanted, Randall.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.035
She looked me in the eye
and she said to me,

13:55.168 --> 13:57.470
"Build me that house,"
which is exactly what I've done.

13:57.604 --> 14:02.009
-Kev...
-Don't "Kev" me, Randall.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.513
I was a pain in her ass
her entire life.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.549
(muffled music playing
on earbuds)

14:12.019 --> 14:13.453
If you want to go get drunk
every night

14:13.586 --> 14:15.588
and make a fool out of yourself,
there's really not much

14:15.722 --> 14:17.991
I can do about it, but don't...

14:18.125 --> 14:20.560
bring your brother and sister
down with you.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.598
Get it together, Kevin.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.138
KEVIN:
Building this house was
the one good thing that I did.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.705
It was the one good thing.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.046
And I'm-I'm gonna honor
her wishes if it kills me.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.515
-KATE: Kev, don't go.
-I'm not going.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.483
I'm getting more walnut shrimp.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.892
KEVIN:
Yes!

14:55.662 --> 14:57.097
(Jack grunts)

15:00.467 --> 15:01.801
Hey, what's going on?

15:01.935 --> 15:03.703
-REBECCA: What's up, bud?
-I lost another tooth!

15:03.836 --> 15:06.206
-REBECCA: Oh!
-JACK: You-- That makes seven
for you,

15:06.339 --> 15:08.608
five for Randall, and...

15:08.741 --> 15:10.277
Zero for me.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.711
That's okay, Katie girl,

15:11.844 --> 15:13.513
'cause you are gonna be young
forever.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.848
-Mm-hmm. (chuckles)
-Okay? You're gonna be young
forever.

15:15.983 --> 15:19.052
But somebody's getting a visit
from the tooth fairy tonight.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.321
-REBECCA: Ooh!
-Yeah, and I'm gonna catch her.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.123
-Huh?
-What do you mean catch her?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.691
I'm gonna stay up all night,

15:24.824 --> 15:27.027
and when she flies in here,
I'm gonna catch her.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.396
-Hmm.
-Okay.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.198
I want pancakes.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.033
-Me, too!
-Okay.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.402
-(chuckles)
-I guess I'll make pancakes.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.237
(chuckles):
Yeah.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.406
What's going on, bud?

15:39.539 --> 15:42.409
I always have bad dreams
when the tooth fairy comes.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.877
I don't want her in my room.
She's a stranger.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.714
Well, she's not really
a stranger.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.482
(clicks tongue)

15:49.616 --> 15:51.251
I know her.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.986
I've gone to lunch with her
a couple times.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.654
We've even gone to see
some movies together.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.894
Okay, can I tell you
a little secret?

16:02.029 --> 16:04.164
Come here.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.733
Now, this is something that most
parents don't tell their kids

16:06.866 --> 16:08.035
until they're much older,

16:08.168 --> 16:09.669
so you cannot tell
your brother or sister.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.039
I don't want to ruin the magic
for them, okay?

16:12.172 --> 16:15.175
I think this'll make you
feel better, though.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.477
(whispers inaudibly)

16:21.681 --> 16:24.551
-Really?
-Really.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.320
But that has to stay
between us, okay?

16:29.056 --> 16:31.058
(chuckles softly)

16:33.826 --> 16:35.528
I can squeeze my meetings
into two days most weeks

16:35.662 --> 16:37.030
so I can spend
more time with her.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.399
No, no, Randall, this is
the opposite of what she wanted.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.269
-Remember her
Thanksgiving speech?
-Yeah, I know what she said.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.737
"You will not make your lives
smaller because of me.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.573
"This thing
that is happening to me

16:46.706 --> 16:47.574
will not be the thing
that holds you..."

16:47.707 --> 16:49.942
I know what she said, Kevin.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.112
But I also know her.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.814
She would understand how we
would have to change the plan.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.116
You can take my word for it.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.584
I don't need to take
your word for it.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.219
I can take her word for it.
She said it.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.457
No, I-I know, I know, you guys
have had this really special--

17:04.591 --> 17:06.626
I think twisted-- relationship
where y-you whisper

17:06.759 --> 17:09.429
-your soul secrets to each other
your whole lives...
-"Soul secrets."

17:09.562 --> 17:11.764
...but that doesn't give you the
right to override her wishes.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.301
Especially when she left Kate
in charge.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.768
Yeah, well,
Kate's barely said a word.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.407
(stammers, sighs)

17:22.375 --> 17:24.010
Sorry, Kate, I just...

17:24.144 --> 17:26.446
What I meant was,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.815
no one should have to make
this kind of decision alone.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.917
Right. Got it.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.963
Hi. Thought maybe we could
paint our nails together.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.031
Really?

17:45.165 --> 17:48.301
Yeah. Come on.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.538
We'll do our nails and gossip.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.340
You know, woman to woman.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.608
Come here. Let me see that hand.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.480
So talk to me. What's going on?

18:00.613 --> 18:03.483
(sighs)
They're always ahead of me.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.985
Kevin's better at board games.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.887
-REBECCA: Mm-hmm.
-Randall's better at reading.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.390
And they're both better
at losing their teeth.

18:10.523 --> 18:14.661
Oh. Bug, come on,
don't worry about your brothers.

18:14.794 --> 18:19.132
You are just,
you're a late bloomer.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.368
Do you know what that means?

18:21.501 --> 18:24.070
(chuckles) It means
that it might take you

18:24.204 --> 18:26.139
a little bit more time to do
some things than other people,

18:26.273 --> 18:28.741
but when you're ready? Ugh.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.977
You're gonna leave them
all in the dust.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.812
Well, maybe Kevin.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.314
(laughs)

18:34.447 --> 18:35.782
All right,
let me finish your hand.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.153
KEVIN:
How'd they get it to purr
like that, you know?

18:40.287 --> 18:42.189
It's... Hmm.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.690
Hi, Mom.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.693
Oh. Hello.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.296
LAILA:
Rebecca wanted to put
some makeup on all by herself.

18:51.998 --> 18:52.865
KATE:
Oh.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.702
You look beautiful.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.671
That eye shadow really
complements your eye color.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.507
Thank you.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.675
I wanted to let you know I'm
gonna take your mom on a walk.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.677
Oh.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.415
Mom, can I, uh,
take that walk with you?

19:08.548 --> 19:10.883
Sure. That sounds nice.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.386
Okay. Well, I've got it,
if you want to take lunch.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.322
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.691
Why don't we go and see

19:18.825 --> 19:20.293
if there are any apples
on the tree?

19:20.427 --> 19:22.362
Huh. Hmm.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.241
That's not our mom, Kev.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.943
No, it's not.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.513
Our mother was magic.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.688
She always knew exactly
what each one of us needed.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.807
I'm sure she meant well.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.943
Sitting us down
and sharing her wishes with us.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.482
But she couldn't have imagined
what this would feel like.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.651
She couldn't have imagined
how deep the need would be

20:18.785 --> 20:21.220
to pay her back
for everything she did.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.991
To do right
by what's left of her.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.459
(ragged exhale)

20:28.428 --> 20:31.531
It's a beautiful house, man,

20:31.664 --> 20:34.267
but I'm not gonna leave her
in it all alone.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.569
And nothing you say
can change my mind.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.554
"Good night, stars.
Good night, air.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.624
Good night, noises everywhere."

21:00.927 --> 21:04.497
Okay, Kate, so Dad's
on a site visit in New Jersey

21:04.631 --> 21:06.566
and I have been up
with you guys since 4:30,

21:06.699 --> 21:09.068
so I'm gonna bring you
to your room

21:09.201 --> 21:10.737
and I really, really, really
need you to go to sleep

21:10.870 --> 21:12.204
and not wake up your brothers.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.377
(exhales)
All right, here we go.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.949
(Kate crying)

21:29.822 --> 21:31.624
(Rebecca sighs)

21:34.126 --> 21:36.228
(laughs softly)

21:36.363 --> 21:38.865
So, that is Abby, Sid's sister.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.068
And she is having an affair
with Richard.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.538
Oh, and then Gary is having
an affair with Judy.

21:45.672 --> 21:49.442
And Laura is having an affair
with her boss Scooter.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.378
(sniffs)

21:51.511 --> 21:54.280
Mmm, this is really nice.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.483
(TV continues indistinctly)

21:59.352 --> 22:00.920
(Kate crying)

22:03.856 --> 22:05.792
(gasps)
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.795
Kate, sweetheart, are you okay?

22:08.928 --> 22:11.097
Are you okay, baby girl?
I'm so sorry.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.365
Mommy's so sorry.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.967
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

22:15.101 --> 22:17.604
Oh, my goodness.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.138
(birds chirping)

22:19.271 --> 22:22.442
Oh, look at that hummingbird.

22:22.575 --> 22:23.910
I think there's
like a whole family.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.680
Sweet.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.919
* *

22:37.724 --> 22:40.092
I could crush some wonton soup.

22:40.226 --> 22:42.495
Oh, they probably ordered
the good Chinese by now.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.096
Oh, they so did.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.966
Maybe we could go get some.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.935
Mm-mm, and get sucked
back into their drama?

22:49.068 --> 22:50.102
It's not worth it.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.941
Do you think
Randall's stormed off yet?

22:55.074 --> 22:57.644
-(chuckles) Ages ago.
-(both laugh)

22:57.777 --> 23:00.780
Yeah, it's hilarious, isn't it?

23:00.913 --> 23:04.617
Their mother is slowly dying
from this horrific disease,

23:04.751 --> 23:07.820
and you two can predict
what miserable happenings

23:07.954 --> 23:10.590
are taking place
as they debate her care.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.991
What a hoot.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.430
You know, Phil,
I've been a part of this family

23:17.564 --> 23:20.533
for over 30 years.

23:20.667 --> 23:23.670
And so, yeah, sometimes
I-I hole up and blow off steam,

23:23.803 --> 23:25.638
because they can
drive me a little nuts,

23:25.772 --> 23:30.109
with their feelings
and their speeches

23:30.242 --> 23:32.779
and their always wanting to move
somebody into your damn house.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.283
I don't know, it's like...

23:37.416 --> 23:43.055
sometimes I think
it's been the greatest burden

23:43.189 --> 23:45.024
and the greatest blessing
of my life,

23:45.157 --> 23:47.359
being a part of this family.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.795
(exhales)
Same, same.

23:51.197 --> 23:54.366
Would you say it was, like,
equal parts burden and blessing?

23:54.501 --> 23:56.202
Or is it more like, 60-40?

23:56.335 --> 23:59.305
Oh, depends on the day,
Big Phil.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.107
Depends on the day.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.512
Wasn't that a beautiful walk?

24:10.817 --> 24:13.319
Mom, do you mind if I sit here
until you fall asleep?

24:15.054 --> 24:18.324
Okay. Whatever you want, dear.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.560
Okay.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.429
Where were we?

24:23.563 --> 24:25.632
Let's see.

24:28.635 --> 24:32.104
"So she sat by the river,
thinking about what she said."

24:32.238 --> 24:33.339
(cries softly)

24:35.542 --> 24:37.944
Hi, Dr. K,
this is Rebecca Pearson.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.346
Um, you delivered my babies.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.582
(exhales) I know you're not
in the office right now,

24:42.715 --> 24:45.384
but I thought you might check
your messages at night.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.287
So, my daughter Kate
fell off the bed.

24:48.420 --> 24:53.626
Um, I just took my eyes off
of her for one minute and, um...

24:53.760 --> 24:55.562
I-I called the emergency clinic,
and they told me

24:55.695 --> 24:58.097
as long as she's acting normal,
just to keep a close eye on her,

24:58.230 --> 24:59.766
but it doesn't feel
like it's enough.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.901
I-I know you're not
a pediatrician,

25:02.034 --> 25:04.136
but I know you also work
with a lot of babies,

25:04.270 --> 25:07.139
and-and I trust you.

25:07.273 --> 25:10.076
I thought you might have
some good advice for me

25:10.209 --> 25:12.579
because I don't...
I don't really know what to do

25:12.712 --> 25:15.648
and I'm all by myself here.

25:15.782 --> 25:18.084
(exhales) So, could you
please call me back?

25:18.217 --> 25:20.286
(Kate crying)

25:20.419 --> 25:22.021
"...at the same time."

25:31.063 --> 25:33.165
(line ringing)

25:33.299 --> 25:35.602
-TOBY (over phone): Hey.
-Hey.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.236
I'm calling to check
on the kids.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.171
-How's it going?
-Yeah, good.

25:39.305 --> 25:42.008
Laura and I took the kids
to that new brunch spot,

25:42.141 --> 25:44.176
and it turns out
that Hailey's new favorite food

25:44.310 --> 25:45.978
is huevos rancheros.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.781
God, our kids have great taste.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.583
Yeah. How's it going over there?

25:50.717 --> 25:51.951
(sighs)

25:52.084 --> 25:53.753
Not great.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.955
She can't remember
that Miguel is gone.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.591
Ah. I'm sorry.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.160
Yeah, so we're trying
to figure out what to do next,

26:01.293 --> 26:03.195
and Randall and Kevin are
at each other's throats, I...

26:03.329 --> 26:07.466
Yeah, but that's technically
up to you, right?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.969
-I mean, she appointed you
her guardian.
-Yeah.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.271
(exhales)
Yeah, I don't know.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.840
I can't decide
what's best, Tobe.

26:15.074 --> 26:15.842
Um...

26:18.077 --> 26:19.712
Permission to overstep,

26:19.846 --> 26:23.149
as your former husband/
current co-parent?

26:23.282 --> 26:25.517
(laughs softly)
Permission granted.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.022
Kate, you are, in every way,

26:30.156 --> 26:32.458
what the kids
refer to as a baller.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.961
All right? You got
your master's in education,

26:35.094 --> 26:36.663
you're designing
an arts curriculum

26:36.796 --> 26:38.497
for the friggin' state
of California.

26:38.631 --> 26:41.400
All while mom-ing
and wife-ing up a storm.

26:41.533 --> 26:44.136
But when you get around
your brothers... (sighs)

26:44.270 --> 26:48.775
I don't know, you become this
unsteady version of yourself.

26:50.042 --> 26:54.080
And I just, I don't get it.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.015
Yeah. I don't either.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.219
Your mom chose you
for a reason, Kate.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.757
Thank you, Tobe.

27:04.891 --> 27:08.260
Oh, my God,
should we get back together?

27:08.394 --> 27:10.763
Okay, good night, Toby.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.064
I'll talk to you later.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.666
Good night.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.677
(Kate cooing)

27:26.879 --> 27:30.549
Hey, baby girl. Hey, there.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.019
How are you feeling, huh?

27:33.152 --> 27:36.222
You okay? Come here, Kate.

27:36.355 --> 27:39.025
Oh, yeah, you're okay.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.027
You're okay. Oh, God.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.295
Thank God. Ugh.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.131
You're smiling at Mama.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.600
Oh, Kate, you know
exactly what Mommy needed.

27:57.710 --> 27:58.978
JACK (distant):
Rebecca?

27:59.111 --> 28:00.246
(Rebecca groans)

28:00.379 --> 28:03.149
Hey, Bec, I need help.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.417
What is it?

28:05.551 --> 28:07.954
You know I haven't had more than
two hours of sleep in weeks?

28:08.087 --> 28:10.757
I know. We-we have a situation.

28:10.890 --> 28:14.126
Kevin. Ugh, it's everywhere.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.996
It's like he went and then
made a snow angel in it,

28:17.129 --> 28:18.798
-but instead of snow, it's...
-I get it.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.100
Yeah, can-can you go
get the trash can

28:21.233 --> 28:23.669
and-and run a bath, please?

28:23.803 --> 28:25.571
(sighs)

28:29.809 --> 28:31.911
-I was never here.
-Mm-hmm.

28:37.383 --> 28:40.319
Hey, baby. Can we talk?

28:41.320 --> 28:43.122
Yeah, we can talk.

28:43.255 --> 28:48.094
So, I've been thinking about
this a lot lately, and, um...

28:48.227 --> 28:50.296
And you want to move Rebecca
into our house.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.366
I don't see
another option here, Beth.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.435
She needs to be around family,

28:56.568 --> 28:58.670
and I need to be
the one in charge

28:58.805 --> 29:01.440
of the day-to-day decisions
about her care.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.110
Kate's overwhelmed. This is
clearly too much for her.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.212
And Kevin says he'll come visit
every couple of weeks,

29:06.345 --> 29:07.679
but who knows if that's true?

29:07.814 --> 29:09.448
He could be off in New Zealand

29:09.581 --> 29:11.450
filming the new Avatar 7
at the drop of a hat.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.320
Randall,

29:14.453 --> 29:17.123
don't underestimate your sister.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.959
She has had to navigate
her larger-than-life brothers

29:20.092 --> 29:22.862
and their massive egos
her entire life.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.797
And that is a load
to carry, too.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.565
(laughter)

29:26.698 --> 29:27.867
And look at your brother
over there.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.536
-Like, look at him.
-KEVIN (distant): Careful.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.671
BETH:
He is not
the irresponsible screwup

29:32.805 --> 29:35.808
that you knew
growing up, Randall.

29:35.942 --> 29:39.411
Like, I hear you talking
about them, and, baby,

29:39.545 --> 29:43.682
you are talking about versions
of them that no longer exist.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.089
MADISON:
We had the best time.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.824
-The town is so cute...
-Yeah?

29:51.958 --> 29:54.426
-...the air is so crisp.
-Oh, you don't realize

29:54.560 --> 29:56.829
how bad L.A. smog is
until you breathe real air.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.664
-I've been saying that. Yeah.
-(laughs): Yeah.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.566
Have fun. Breathe it in.

30:07.073 --> 30:10.176
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.579
Are you okay?

30:15.647 --> 30:17.884
Yeah. Yeah.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.253
Kevin.

30:21.387 --> 30:24.356
Um...

30:24.490 --> 30:26.358
You know, my mom used
to talk about this day

30:26.492 --> 30:28.727
from back when we were younger.

30:28.861 --> 30:31.363
It's a lazy Saturday,
you know, lazy Saturday

30:31.497 --> 30:34.867
with nothing to do,
no one had anywhere to be.

30:35.001 --> 30:39.305
We'd all just, um,
watch old movies together,

30:39.438 --> 30:42.708
play foursquare,
pin the tail on the donkey.

30:45.111 --> 30:48.780
I don't know, I had this
stupid idea that...

30:48.915 --> 30:50.950
building this house
could somehow recreate

30:51.083 --> 30:53.319
that for her, you know,
with us and all the grandkids.

30:53.452 --> 30:54.887
That's not stupid at all.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.624
I don't know.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.594
(sighs)

31:02.728 --> 31:04.530
Randall wants
to move her to Philly.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.367
I've been fighting him
on it all day, but...

31:10.302 --> 31:13.172
...maybe he's right.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.441
Maybe he's right,
maybe-maybe keeping her here,

31:15.574 --> 31:18.244
without all of us here,
maybe that's not what's best

31:18.377 --> 31:19.946
for her, you know? I...

31:22.148 --> 31:23.149
I don't know.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.953
I got to get this one right.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.460
KATE:
Hey.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.295
Let's get Randall.
We have to talk.

31:42.801 --> 31:45.871
I will make a decision
about what's best for Mom

31:46.005 --> 31:48.474
because she trusted me to do it.

31:48.607 --> 31:53.612
But first you two have got
to be able to look at her.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.017
What are you talking about?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.885
We look at her all the time.

32:00.019 --> 32:03.189
No, you don't, Randall.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.491
And I get it.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.827
I get it,
because Mom was magnificent.

32:08.961 --> 32:13.165
And to see her like this
is really brutal.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.834
But how can we even talk about
her moving into your house

32:15.968 --> 32:18.270
when you can't even
look her in the eye?

32:20.339 --> 32:22.975
And, Kev, you're touching her
less and less.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.880
Come with me.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.049
Let's go.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.253
Wash, wash, wash.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.055
Scrub, scrub, scrub.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.889
Mommy's got you.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.625
Mommy's got you. Yeah.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.229
Here. Brush her hair.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.031
Just be gentle
around the tangles.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.999
I have daughters.
I know how to brush.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.068
Okay.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.469
RANDALL:
Here we go, Mom.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.811
Kev, her hands are dry.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.520
(clicking)

33:08.654 --> 33:09.688
(softly):
Okay, let me see...

33:33.279 --> 33:35.081
(timer ticking)

33:39.951 --> 33:41.553
(timer chimes)

33:48.060 --> 33:50.162
Pregnant.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.164
How do you feel?

33:52.298 --> 33:54.933
I feel...

33:55.067 --> 33:56.635
hungry.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.472
(TV playing indistinctly)

34:02.441 --> 34:04.176
I'm not ready.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.444
You seemed pretty ready
that night

34:05.577 --> 34:07.479
-in the bathroom at Froggy's.
-Uh...

34:07.613 --> 34:10.649
I was caught up in the moment.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.384
Look, Bec...

34:14.320 --> 34:15.621
...we can do this.

34:17.089 --> 34:20.626
It-It's just one
tiny little baby.

34:20.759 --> 34:21.793
Two of us.

34:24.296 --> 34:27.433
One baby...

34:27.566 --> 34:29.135
two of us.

34:30.336 --> 34:33.139
(overlapping chatter)

34:33.272 --> 34:35.107
-Here you go.
-I mean, that's what
you're supposed...

34:35.241 --> 34:38.944
Okay, is-is it bad
that we had Chinese yesterday

34:39.077 --> 34:40.479
for lunch and dinner, and now
we're eating it for breakfast?

34:40.612 --> 34:42.181
-Not one bit.
-Not for me.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.150
I love it.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.454
Um, okay, I, um...

34:48.587 --> 34:52.291
have an announcement to make
while the kids are off playing,

34:52.424 --> 34:53.825
about Mom.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.827
What, now? With everyone here?

34:55.961 --> 34:57.629
Yes.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.532
They're our family,
and they should be a part of it.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.537
(clears throat)

35:05.671 --> 35:08.574
Okay, um...

35:08.707 --> 35:10.142
Mom moving to Philly
to live with you

35:10.276 --> 35:11.677
is not an option, Randall.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.480
You'd have to pull back
on your work in D.C.,

35:14.613 --> 35:16.248
and that's exactly
what Mom didn't want.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.816
So I can't allow it.

35:19.151 --> 35:20.519
And Kev.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.422
Keeping her here,
without family,

35:23.555 --> 35:24.856
we're not gonna do that either.

35:26.558 --> 35:29.228
Philip and I had
a long talk last night,

35:29.361 --> 35:31.163
and we are going
to bring her to L.A.

35:31.297 --> 35:36.067
And we are gonna find
the best place for her to live.

35:36.202 --> 35:38.370
Whether it's in
an incredible facility

35:38.504 --> 35:40.071
or if she's gonna
move in with us.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.584
Can I offer up another idea?

35:54.220 --> 35:55.521
Okay.

35:59.225 --> 36:03.094
That thing you did yesterday,
having us look at her,

36:03.229 --> 36:05.897
it helped me.

36:06.031 --> 36:10.101
And I'm gonna honor
whatever your wishes are.

36:10.236 --> 36:12.871
But I now know
what the new plan should be.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.576
-Okay.
-Okay.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.978
Well...
(clears throat)

36:20.111 --> 36:22.548
Sophie and I were up all night
talking as well,

36:22.681 --> 36:26.785
and, uh, we would
like to move here.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.454
And live with Mom.

36:31.223 --> 36:34.092
You know, I never really
liked it in L.A. anyway, so...

36:39.231 --> 36:41.567
Big Three Homes is based
on the East Coast,

36:41.700 --> 36:44.270
The Manny stops shooting
next week, so...

36:44.403 --> 36:47.439
Yeah, okay, I think
that's an amazing offer, but...

36:47.573 --> 36:50.342
I can't allow you to move away
from your children.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.777
MADISON:
He won't be.

36:53.712 --> 36:57.249
Elijah's job is remote,

36:57.383 --> 37:00.018
and all of his family
is in New Jersey.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.020
And we have been
talking for a while

37:02.153 --> 37:04.423
about wanting
to be closer to them.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.658
To be honest,
Kevin was pretty much

37:06.792 --> 37:08.627
the only thing keeping
our family in L.A.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.796
(laughs softly)

37:10.929 --> 37:13.031
KATE:
Oh.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.501
I don't know.
I still feel like...

37:15.634 --> 37:18.704
It's just so much
to do all alone.

37:18.837 --> 37:19.938
-I...
-NICKY: They won't be alone.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.476
I mean, we're gonna
be here, right?

37:24.610 --> 37:27.479
We're not gonna do the showers
and all that gross stuff,

37:27.613 --> 37:29.214
-but we will be here.
-(soft laughter)

37:29.348 --> 37:33.051
Plus, Edie's actually turned
out to be a half-decent cook.

37:33.184 --> 37:34.620
And Nicky has actually
turned out to be

37:34.753 --> 37:36.121
a half-decent human being.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.557
(laughter)

37:38.690 --> 37:41.159
We have an opportunity here
to give Mom

37:41.293 --> 37:45.096
exactly what she wanted,
for her and for us.

37:49.835 --> 37:50.969
What do you say?

37:57.543 --> 37:58.677
Okay.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.014
Randall,

38:03.148 --> 38:06.051
I know you're probably thinking
I'm not up for it, but...

38:07.052 --> 38:08.887
...I am.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.841
Thank you.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.947
KATE:
Okay. Well, great.

38:36.081 --> 38:39.585
I guess that, uh,
concludes our family meeting?

38:39.718 --> 38:41.119
-KEVIN: Okay.
-Praise be.

38:41.252 --> 38:42.888
(laughter)

38:44.923 --> 38:48.927
Who knows, maybe this...
this was the reason all along.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.896
The reason for what?

38:52.831 --> 38:54.466
That there are three of us.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.668
* *

39:01.573 --> 39:03.108
* There is a house *

39:03.241 --> 39:05.377
* Built out of stone... *

39:05.511 --> 39:08.046
...around and pull.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.748
Can you try it?

39:09.881 --> 39:12.283
* Wooden floors, walls *

39:12.418 --> 39:15.153
* And window sills... *

39:15.286 --> 39:17.288
Yep.

39:17.423 --> 39:18.757
KEVIN:
All right, we'll get these on...

39:18.890 --> 39:21.292
* Tables and chairs worn *

39:21.427 --> 39:23.395
* By all of the dust... *

39:23.529 --> 39:25.296
...go outside?
It's that time of year.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.232
Beautiful weather,
a little breeze kicking in.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.767
You ready? Here we go.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.704
* Where I don't feel alone *

39:35.741 --> 39:38.577
* This is a place *

39:38.710 --> 39:41.447
* Where I feel at home... *

39:41.580 --> 39:44.416
ELIJAH:
Three, two, one.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.785
(laughter)

39:46.918 --> 39:48.454
Hello, hello. Welcome.

39:48.587 --> 39:49.988
Hey, did you bring the, um...

39:50.121 --> 39:52.257
Walnut shrimp? What am I, new?

39:53.224 --> 39:55.260
* *

39:57.429 --> 39:59.765
RANDALL:
"It's a rite of spring
in upstate New York.

39:59.898 --> 40:03.769
Jamaican workers harvest ramps
to cook up a taste of home."

40:04.970 --> 40:07.205
"The Walmart in New York
is a far cry..."

40:07.338 --> 40:12.343
* I built *

40:13.278 --> 40:16.147
* A home *

40:16.281 --> 40:18.450
* For you *

40:19.685 --> 40:23.188
* For me *

40:23.321 --> 40:25.190
* Until... *

40:25.323 --> 40:26.958
How was your flight?

40:27.092 --> 40:32.230
* It dis... appeared *

40:32.363 --> 40:35.233
* From me *

40:35.366 --> 40:39.170
* From you *

40:39.304 --> 40:41.873
* And now *

40:42.007 --> 40:45.511
* It's time *

40:45.644 --> 40:50.582
* To leave *

40:50.716 --> 40:52.951
* And turn *

40:55.186 --> 40:57.255
* To dust *

40:57.388 --> 40:59.558
Good night, Mom. Sleep tight.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.695
* Out in the garden *

41:03.829 --> 41:05.931
* Where we planted the seeds *

41:06.064 --> 41:08.667
(whispers):
Sleep tight.

41:08.800 --> 41:14.405
* There is a tree as old as me *

41:19.578 --> 41:21.613
* By the cracks of his skin *

41:21.747 --> 41:26.451
* I climbed to the top *

41:26.585 --> 41:29.588
* I climbed the tree *

41:29.721 --> 41:30.889
* To see the world... *

41:31.022 --> 41:32.724
(phone ringing)

41:32.858 --> 41:34.259
Hey, brother.

41:34.392 --> 41:36.027
KEVIN (over phone):
Hey.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.296
(exhales)

41:38.429 --> 41:39.898
You and the girls and Beth

41:40.031 --> 41:41.633
should get here
as soon as you can.

41:41.767 --> 41:44.202
They're saying
it won't be long now.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.707
Okay.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.610
Okay.
