00:02.846 --> 00:04.152
[Door opens]

00:04.152 --> 00:06.495
Lemon, do you know what the kidney does?

00:06.495 --> 00:08.704
Of course, I was a kidney in
my fifth grade school play.

00:08.704 --> 00:11.443
# Oh, I'm the kidney... #

00:12.287 --> 00:14.161
The other kidney is singing now.

00:14.161 --> 00:15.165
Milton needs a kidney.

00:15.165 --> 00:16.504
Milton, as in your dad?

00:16.504 --> 00:18.078
My dad? I don't know this guy.

00:18.078 --> 00:19.584
Professor Milton Greene,
who's writing

00:19.584 --> 00:20.822
a three-volume biography of Jimmy Carter

00:20.822 --> 00:23.501
and if I give him a kidney,
he could live to finish it.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.342
So, what are you going to do?

00:25.342 --> 00:27.584
I don't know. He's too old for the waiting lists.

00:27.584 --> 00:30.688
And since Giuliani left,
it's gotten tougher to harvest hobo organs.

00:31.601 --> 00:34.414
So it's up to me and I don't want to be a match.

00:34.414 --> 00:35.954
It's too much.

00:35.954 --> 00:38.263
Does that make me a bad person?
- Of course not.

00:38.263 --> 00:41.276
This is really hard. I need your help.

00:41.276 --> 00:45.494
# The brain helps you make decisions... #

00:45.494 --> 00:46.699
Okay.

00:46.699 --> 00:48.708
# And your colon pushes out... #

00:48.708 --> 00:50.314
Okay, that's not... helpful.

00:50.314 --> 00:51.306
Sorry.

01:12.910 --> 01:16.425
So, NBC is making me go on The
Vontella Show to promote T.G.S.

01:16.425 --> 01:18.902
Ugh, that show is the worst.

01:18.902 --> 01:21.112
I know, I swore I'd never go on
again after that one time.

01:21.112 --> 01:22.953
We get paid to make each other laugh.

01:22.953 --> 01:25.555
Jenna, meet your half-sister, Courtney!

01:26.467 --> 01:28.443
[Audience cheers] Give me
my money, you bitch!

01:28.443 --> 01:29.280
Never!

01:29.280 --> 01:31.388
They want me to go on as a relationship expert

01:31.388 --> 01:33.062
because of the "Dealbreakers" sketch.

01:33.062 --> 01:34.904
And since you're the face of "Dealbreakers"

01:34.904 --> 01:36.544
you're going with me.

01:36.544 --> 01:38.586
What? No, come on.

01:38.586 --> 01:39.758
I thought you wanted the attention.

01:39.758 --> 01:42.502
Yeah, but not like that.
Remember the other time you were on?

01:42.502 --> 01:44.343
And I was all like, "talk to the hand."

01:44.343 --> 01:45.749
Jenna, come on out!

01:45.749 --> 01:48.193
You give me back my man, bitch!

01:48.193 --> 01:49.532
Never!

01:49.532 --> 01:50.570
[Both screaming]

01:50.570 --> 01:52.545
Can't we just keep doing magazines?

01:52.545 --> 01:54.108
I will see you on Vontella, Liz.

01:55.959 --> 01:59.943
Now, kidney transplantation
is no laughing matter.

01:59.943 --> 02:01.784
So, I apologize.

02:01.784 --> 02:04.830
[Laughs] "Kidney" is just such a funny word.

02:04.830 --> 02:06.270
How long is this
going to take, Leo?

02:06.270 --> 02:07.977
Uh... well, this
is the consent form

02:07.977 --> 02:10.152
for the tests today.

02:10.152 --> 02:12.864
This is incorrect, doctor.
I'm not giving him a kidney.

02:12.864 --> 02:14.003
It's the other way around.

02:14.003 --> 02:16.714
Oh, brother... are you sure?

02:16.714 --> 02:19.024
If anyone is giving anyone
a kidney at all. Who knows?

02:19.024 --> 02:20.597
Leo: You know what?

02:20.597 --> 02:24.112
I'll just remember that it's the
opposite of what these say.

02:24.112 --> 02:26.555
I'd really be more comfortable
if you rewrote the form.

02:26.555 --> 02:28.062
No, I'll remember.

02:28.062 --> 02:32.213
Opposite, opposite, opposite.

02:32.213 --> 02:34.322
Okay, but you're clear that he's
giving a kidney to me.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.929
I really think you're jumping the gun here.

02:35.929 --> 02:37.334
We don't even know
if we're a match.

02:37.334 --> 02:39.979
So, you shouldn't assume that
you're going to get my kidney.

02:39.979 --> 02:41.519
No, of course, no, I'm sorry.

02:41.519 --> 02:43.595
It's just that, without a
kidney, I'm gonna die.

02:43.595 --> 02:45.838
[Leo laughs]

02:45.838 --> 02:49.420
I think it's the hard "K" sound
that's making me giggle.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.412
Kidney.

02:53.570 --> 02:55.646
Mr. Jordan, exciting news.

02:55.646 --> 02:56.683
Your old high school wants you
to speak at graduation.

02:56.683 --> 03:00.600
And they said you can
drop up to five "f-bombs."

03:00.600 --> 03:01.704
Not interested.

03:01.704 --> 03:03.011
Why not?

03:03.011 --> 03:04.985
Because Frank Lucas
High School was a hellhole.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.017
Grizz knows, he was there.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.240
A drug dealer named Campbell,
he ruled that school.

03:11.078 --> 03:12.915
He wanted me to find a snitch called Baby.

03:13.790 --> 03:15.229
Campbell wanted me to cut him open.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.438
Oh, my, that's very urban.

03:17.438 --> 03:19.881
I wouldn't do it. I dropped out.

03:19.881 --> 03:21.981
And I vowed never to go back to that place.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.305
Campbell was actually Mr. Campbell,

03:25.305 --> 03:26.142
his science teacher.

03:26.142 --> 03:28.451
His science teacher was a drug dealer?

03:28.451 --> 03:30.025
That's terrible.

03:30.025 --> 03:31.899
Science was my most favorite subject

03:31.899 --> 03:33.339
especially the Old Testament.

03:33.339 --> 03:34.945
He wasn't a drug dealer.

03:34.945 --> 03:36.954
Tracy dropped out of high school because

03:36.954 --> 03:39.264
Mr. Campbell wanted him to dissect a frog.

03:39.264 --> 03:40.502
Tracy couldn't do it.

03:40.502 --> 03:41.666
He cried in front of the whole class.

03:42.545 --> 03:44.553
It was bad, I had to deny
ever being friends with him.

03:44.553 --> 03:47.087
Just like Peter did to Jesus in Science.

03:50.947 --> 03:54.428
If your boyfriend calls out his
brother's name during sex...

03:54.428 --> 03:56.973
that's a dealbreaker, ladies!

03:56.973 --> 03:58.479
[Audience laughs and applauds]

03:58.479 --> 04:00.622
That skit was crazy!

04:00.622 --> 04:02.162
That actually
happened to Liz.

04:02.162 --> 04:03.998
Vontella don't care who Liz is.

04:05.174 --> 04:06.446
Jenna? We have a surprise for you.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.789
I swear to God, Courtney, I will rip your wig off.

04:08.789 --> 04:10.161
No, honey, Courtney's dead.

04:10.161 --> 04:11.869
You are going to answer

04:11.869 --> 04:14.882
our audience's relationship questions!

04:14.882 --> 04:16.555
[Applause] Yes!

04:16.555 --> 04:20.505
This guy I'm dating owns a tanning salon,
but he won't let me tan for free

04:20.505 --> 04:22.715
but he lets girls that
he's friends with tan for free

04:22.715 --> 04:25.896
so I go to this other tanning salon down
the street to try to not make it a thing.

04:25.896 --> 04:28.105
But you know how there's no secrets
in the tanning salon community?

04:28.105 --> 04:29.645
So what should I do?

04:29.645 --> 04:31.486
Um...

04:31.486 --> 04:32.891
[Jenna stammers]

04:32.891 --> 04:35.235
I don't know.

04:35.235 --> 04:36.339
Liz?

04:36.339 --> 04:38.951
Oh, boy. Well, whatever that
just was, it's a dealbreaker

04:38.951 --> 04:41.861
because this guy is making you
talk like a crazy person.

04:43.034 --> 04:45.210
You have sexually-transmitted
crazy mouth. Dealbreaker.

04:45.210 --> 04:47.881
[Applause]

04:49.227 --> 04:52.240
My fiancÃ© and I keep arguing
about our wedding plans, and...

04:52.240 --> 04:53.680
Nope, your fiancÃ©'s gay.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.387
Look at him.
Look at you.

04:55.387 --> 04:57.697
Classic case of "fruit blindness."

04:57.697 --> 04:58.834
Vontella: "Fruit blindness"?

04:58.834 --> 05:00.709
Liz: Sir, have you ever kissed a gentleman?

05:00.709 --> 05:02.410
Uh... one time in college.

05:03.287 --> 05:04.626
And a lot since then.

05:04.626 --> 05:07.639
[Audience applauds]
All right!

05:07.639 --> 05:09.715
My boyfriend has been acting
really weird ever since

05:09.715 --> 05:11.656
he got promoted at his job.

05:11.656 --> 05:13.129
Yeah, he thinks he
deserves a "va-jay-jay upgrade."

05:13.129 --> 05:16.142
He doesn't, he's not Tom Brady.
Shut it down. Dealbreaker.

05:16.142 --> 05:17.614
Vontella: Yes, Yes!

05:17.614 --> 05:19.355
Liz: Yeah, there's no such thing as bisexual.

05:19.355 --> 05:22.962
That's just something they invented in
the '90s to sell hair products. Dealbreaker.

05:25.213 --> 05:26.452
Only one snake in the bed. Dealbreaker.

05:26.452 --> 05:27.616
Yes!

05:28.494 --> 05:30.067
I think you guys are going to make it.

05:30.067 --> 05:32.372
Audience: Aww... [Applause]

05:39.943 --> 05:42.453
Kenneth: Mr. Jordan?

05:42.453 --> 05:44.596
I know Mr. Campbell wasn't a drug dealer.

05:44.596 --> 05:45.633
Yes, he was.

05:45.633 --> 05:48.110
I know he was your science teacher.

05:48.110 --> 05:49.215
No, he wasn't.

05:49.215 --> 05:51.927
And I know he didn't ask you to cut up Baby,
he asked you to cut up a frog.

05:51.927 --> 05:53.132
What frog?

05:53.132 --> 05:54.939
And I know you couldn't do it. And you cried.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.948
[Emotional]: When have I ever cried?

05:56.948 --> 05:58.789
And that's why you left school,
because you were ashamed.

05:58.789 --> 06:00.764
[Crying] It's true! There is no Baby!

06:00.764 --> 06:04.346
I was chicken! I was chicken!

06:04.346 --> 06:07.794
A guy crying about a chicken and a baby?
I thought this was a comedy show.

06:07.794 --> 06:09.167
Listen, you know how

06:09.167 --> 06:10.840
I can get to Jack Donaghy's office?

06:10.840 --> 06:11.936
Uh, yes, sir, 52nd floor.

06:13.886 --> 06:16.330
Mr. Jordan...

06:16.330 --> 06:19.275
I understand how hard that must have been,
but it was so long ago.

06:19.275 --> 06:21.486
You can't understand, Ken.

06:21.486 --> 06:24.224
Where I come from, street cred is everything.

06:25.770 --> 06:27.644
That's why, when I left that school in shame

06:27.644 --> 06:31.594
I vowed never to cry again, and I never have!

06:31.594 --> 06:32.766
Um...

06:32.766 --> 06:35.478
[Crying]: Don't die!
I love you, Jack!

06:35.478 --> 06:38.022
A Diet Slice and some pita chips.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.532
I don't want to be here! I don't like it here!

06:40.532 --> 06:43.144
I'm just calling y'all a bunch of racists.

06:43.144 --> 06:46.157
We're not really best friends,
we're just good friends.

06:46.157 --> 06:49.504
I was chicken! I was chicken!

06:49.504 --> 06:51.211
I'm never going back to

06:51.211 --> 06:54.424
Frank Lucas High School to be
reminded of my greatest failure.

06:54.424 --> 06:58.107
Mr. Jordan, I think it's sad that
you're still ashamed of that kid.

06:58.107 --> 06:59.748
That kid is you.

06:59.748 --> 07:01.722
Uh-unh, I've changed, Ken

07:01.722 --> 07:03.998
into a bad-ass adult.

07:03.998 --> 07:07.213
I have a wolf dog,
I have two bad knees

07:07.213 --> 07:08.585
and a gun...

07:08.585 --> 07:09.578
that I lost.

07:13.673 --> 07:15.782
Milton, are you going somewhere?

07:15.782 --> 07:18.594
I have to get back to Bennington.

07:18.594 --> 07:21.105
I owe my publishers a chapter of
"From Peanut to President."

07:21.105 --> 07:22.544
But before I go

07:22.544 --> 07:25.691
I think we should talk about the other day.

07:25.691 --> 07:27.063
Milton, the Donaghys do not talk.

07:27.063 --> 07:30.846
We let things fester until they
erupt in inappropriate anger

07:30.846 --> 07:33.692
preferably during a wedding or
elementary school graduation.

07:33.692 --> 07:36.202
Well, the Greenes are talkers. And huggers.

07:36.202 --> 07:37.842
I'm sorry, Jack.

07:37.842 --> 07:39.683
I should never have put you in this position.

07:39.683 --> 07:42.462
Or this one.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.140
Look, I don't want a kidney from you.

07:45.140 --> 07:47.206
All I want is to make up for lost time.

07:48.922 --> 07:50.360
Can I come back next week?

07:51.902 --> 07:54.145
Sure, okay. We can go to a Yankee game.

07:54.145 --> 07:56.522
I have great seats in the section between

07:56.522 --> 08:00.137
the players' wives and players' mistresses.
But I don't go on Bat Day.

08:00.137 --> 08:02.339
So my son likes baseball.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.698
You know, there's a great sports
memorabilia store on Third Avenue.

08:06.698 --> 08:10.246
Remember Carlton Fisk's
home run in the '75 Series?

08:10.246 --> 08:11.719
That's this ball?

08:11.719 --> 08:13.527
No, that's a ball he fouled off in the third inning.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.904
Huh.

08:15.904 --> 08:17.912
No, I want you to have it.

08:17.912 --> 08:19.385
Oh, Milton, that's too generous.

08:19.385 --> 08:21.962
No, I insist, for
bringing me into your life.

08:21.962 --> 08:23.595
Well, I... I can't.

08:28.122 --> 08:30.499
[Laughs] Jack, we're having a catch.

08:30.499 --> 08:31.503
Don't ruin it, Milton.

08:31.503 --> 08:32.943
Just like Jimmy and Chip Carter.

08:32.943 --> 08:34.148
Did you hear what I said?

08:34.148 --> 08:38.154
[Laughs] This is great.
Whoa!

08:46.500 --> 08:48.375
Damn, "K," you know who that was?

08:48.375 --> 08:50.517
I don't, sir. Do you?

08:50.517 --> 08:51.722
I grew up with that guy.

08:51.722 --> 08:54.233
He was the baddest gangster in my class.

08:54.233 --> 08:58.015
We called him Mean Steve,
but his real name was Steven Killer.

08:58.015 --> 09:01.430
Does seeing him in this menial
job make you think about anything?

09:01.430 --> 09:02.803
Tracy: Well, if a bad-ass O.G. Iike that

09:02.803 --> 09:05.916
could get stuck delivering food,
how did I get out?

09:05.916 --> 09:10.602
Because you're not a bad-bleep O.G.
You're a sensitive artist.

09:10.602 --> 09:12.242
You're different.

09:12.242 --> 09:14.954
And isn't that a message those kids
at your old high school should hear?

09:14.954 --> 09:17.122
You're right, Ken, they should.

09:17.833 --> 09:20.277
Five "f-bombs," right?

09:20.277 --> 09:21.850
[Phone rings]

09:21.850 --> 09:23.189
Hello?

09:23.189 --> 09:24.629
Jack, it's Leo.

09:24.629 --> 09:27.407
I got the, uh, results of your blood work back.

09:27.407 --> 09:29.550
Right? Yes? And?

09:29.550 --> 09:36.512
Well, cytotoxic cross match of target
H.L.A. resulted in lyses of cells.

09:36.512 --> 09:39.022
Now, Jack, in layman's terms...
what do you think that means?

09:39.022 --> 09:40.127
Jack: I don't know.

09:40.127 --> 09:41.935
Could I give this guy a kidney or not?

09:41.935 --> 09:45.952
Due to negative blood tissue match,
transplantation is not recommended.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.459
Damn it, is this written in Greek?

09:47.459 --> 09:49.433
It means we're not a match.

09:49.433 --> 09:51.007
Leo: Oh, sorry.

09:51.007 --> 09:54.321
I was really looking forward to putting
your father's kidney in you.

09:54.321 --> 09:56.129
The other way around, Leo.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.628
[Scoffs] That's not what these forms say.

10:00.011 --> 10:01.644
Lemon...

10:02.824 --> 10:04.129
I'm getting Milton Greene a kidney.

10:04.129 --> 10:06.238
[Gasps] You're a match?
- No, I'm not.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.113
Then where are you going to get a kidney from?

10:08.113 --> 10:09.217
I don't know...

10:09.217 --> 10:12.330
but I have the entire liberal
media establishment at my disposal.

10:12.330 --> 10:14.038
The same manipulation machine
that got people to vote for

10:14.038 --> 10:18.223
Barack Obama and donate all that
money after Rainstorm Katrina.

10:18.223 --> 10:20.063
I'm going to use that to find my dad a kidney.

10:20.063 --> 10:23.946
You should do a celebrity concert
like that gig I did to benefit old gays.

10:23.946 --> 10:25.621
Yes, a benefit concert.

10:25.621 --> 10:28.198
Like "We Are the World" or Weird Al Yankovic's

10:28.198 --> 10:30.407
Iess successful parody benefit,
"We Are the Pizza."

10:30.407 --> 10:32.115
Tell Pete to start building a set.

10:32.115 --> 10:33.855
Wait a minute, we have to do this?

10:33.855 --> 10:35.729
Uh, well, you found a
way to do your day job

10:35.729 --> 10:38.240
and be on Vontella.
Great job, by the way.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.848
I haven't seen that many riled-up dirt bags

10:39.848 --> 10:41.689
since CVS put the cold
medicine behind the counter.

10:41.689 --> 10:44.065
Well, they want me to go back
on Vontella, actually.

10:44.065 --> 10:45.471
But I'm not sure

10:45.471 --> 10:48.015
I'm qualified to give relationship advice.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.359
You're not. Suburban seventh graders
have more sexual experience than you do

10:50.359 --> 10:51.564
but that doesn't matter.

10:51.564 --> 10:53.605
Right, because I'm helping people.

10:53.605 --> 10:54.877
No, you're helping yourself.

10:54.877 --> 10:57.254
So, make the most of this opportunity.

10:57.254 --> 10:59.631
After all, how many years does T.G.S. have left?

10:59.631 --> 11:01.138
I don't know... 20?

11:01.138 --> 11:02.443
[Laughs] What do you
think this is, Wings?

11:02.443 --> 11:05.623
You've got two more years, at best.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.264
Lemon, this is what I've been
trying to tell you

11:07.264 --> 11:09.774
since I first met you. Life is short.

11:09.774 --> 11:12.686
You've got to get out there and get yours.

11:12.686 --> 11:14.293
Get yours... I like that.

11:14.293 --> 11:16.804
Can I use that as one of my catch-phrases?

11:16.804 --> 11:19.783
Uh, sorry, Leo Spaceman's using it as
the title of his new sex book for couples.

11:19.783 --> 11:22.193
Oh. Oh.

11:22.193 --> 11:23.031
Mary...

11:23.031 --> 11:25.039
uh, Elvis...

11:25.039 --> 11:26.244
Mr. Aiken.

11:26.244 --> 11:28.219
Thank you all for coming here
on such short notice.

11:28.219 --> 11:30.998
No problem, I just had my driver drop me off.

11:30.998 --> 11:32.437
So how come I saw you getting off the subway?

11:32.437 --> 11:33.575
What were you doing down there?

11:33.575 --> 11:34.747
Jack: Uh, okay.

11:34.747 --> 11:36.253
I asked the three of
you to be here because

11:36.253 --> 11:38.363
you are all deeply committed
to charity work.

11:38.363 --> 11:41.040
My Mary J. Blige Foundation
is celebrating its 10th year

11:41.040 --> 11:43.242
of searching for the Loch Ness Monster.

11:44.555 --> 11:47.970
Well, musicians have banded together before
to solve all kinds of problems: world hunger

11:47.970 --> 11:50.414
the collapse of the American
farm, global warming...

11:50.414 --> 11:53.159
and, uh... you're 0 for 3, guys.

11:53.159 --> 11:54.865
I am disappointed in us as a group.

11:54.865 --> 11:56.673
Jack: How about a problem...

11:56.673 --> 12:00.355
you can solve?
One song. One man. One kidney.

12:00.355 --> 12:02.698
Elvis: Let me get this straight.

12:02.698 --> 12:05.175
You want us to do a charity
concert for one guy?

12:05.175 --> 12:08.591
Elvis, haven't you said that if a song
reaches just one person, you've done your job?

12:08.591 --> 12:10.029
No, I've never said that.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.440
Fine. Listen, the man who needs
the kidney is my father.

12:12.440 --> 12:16.390
We just met, and I don't want to lose him
before I get a chance to know him.

12:16.390 --> 12:18.198
Please...

12:18.198 --> 12:19.499
I'm asking for your help.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.549
Okay, let's cut to the chase. M. J., you owe me.

12:24.089 --> 12:26.029
Who got you out of a 20-year
exclusive performance contract at SeaWorld?

12:27.236 --> 12:29.039
Aiken, your cousin, Kenneth Parcell,
already promised me you'd do this.

12:30.014 --> 12:31.922
And Elvis, or should I say, Declan McManus...

12:31.922 --> 12:35.035
international art thief...

12:35.035 --> 12:36.976
Okay, Jack Donaghy, you tumbled me.
We'll do it.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.660
Also, you have a ton of
interview requests.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.165
And they want you
on the seventh hour

12:42.165 --> 12:43.538
of the Today show
tomorrow morning.

12:43.538 --> 12:45.480
Tell them all yes.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.890
I'm getting mine, Cerie.

12:47.890 --> 12:50.836
Cerie: Also, Pete and Tracy's wives
are in your office.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.108
Paula is Pete's wife

12:52.108 --> 12:53.414
and Angie is the
black one and...

12:53.414 --> 12:55.589
Okay, Cerie, I got it.

12:55.589 --> 12:58.301
Dr. Liz, we need some advice
from the dealbreaker lady.

12:58.301 --> 13:01.917
I don't know if that's a good idea.
I know you, and I know your husbands...

13:01.917 --> 13:04.929
I just found out Tracy has a secret
credit card I didn't know anything about.

13:04.929 --> 13:07.172
Not on my watch, biotch.

13:07.172 --> 13:09.649
And he's been using that credit
card to pay for a hotel room

13:09.649 --> 13:11.423
here in New York two days a week.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.833
"S" that "D."
Shut it down. Dealbreaker.

13:13.833 --> 13:14.938
Paula.

13:14.938 --> 13:19.793
Pete is refusing to drive to my parents' place
for just two weeks of family vacation.

13:19.793 --> 13:21.265
No to the way to the Jose.

13:21.265 --> 13:24.178
But, Paula, talk it out before you walk it out.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.257
And I'm here in New York while
he's back in Hooglanderveen.

13:27.257 --> 13:30.236
Long distance is the wrong
distance, Sue. Dealbreaker.

13:30.236 --> 13:32.881
Mickey Rourke wants to take me camping.

13:32.881 --> 13:34.789
Dealbreaker, Jenna, God.

13:34.789 --> 13:36.898
I haven't seen my fiancÃ© in seven months.

13:36.898 --> 13:39.500
Cerie, I have two words for you: robot warning.

13:40.145 --> 13:43.124
Okay, that catch-phrase needs a little work.
Dealbreaker!

13:43.124 --> 13:44.765
Teach it like you preach it,
Liz Lemon!

13:44.765 --> 13:46.236
[Cheering]

13:47.677 --> 13:50.187
I almost didn't make it here this afternoon.

13:50.187 --> 13:53.435
But then, a very special friend
of mine showed me the way.

13:53.435 --> 13:55.544
So, I'd like to take
a moment to thank

13:55.544 --> 13:59.293
Victor Cordova from the
Sunoco station on Lenox Avenue. [Applause]

13:59.293 --> 14:01.636
But there's
another reason why

14:01.636 --> 14:05.721
I almost didn't come today... fear.

14:05.721 --> 14:08.331
Fear of letting people know the real me.

14:08.331 --> 14:10.908
I have but one thing to say to all of you.

14:10.908 --> 14:12.506
Be yourself.

14:13.587 --> 14:14.792
And I'm talking to you clearly, gay kid.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.265
Who told?

14:16.265 --> 14:18.876
And you, white kid just trying to go unnoticed.

14:18.876 --> 14:20.918
Aw, come on.

14:20.918 --> 14:23.763
Just be yourself. And I guarantee you,
every single person

14:23.763 --> 14:26.006
in this room

14:26.006 --> 14:30.157
will one day be President of the United States.

14:30.157 --> 14:32.969
Thank you. [Applause]

14:32.969 --> 14:36.853
Tracy? Before you go,
I have a special surprise for you.

14:36.853 --> 14:39.497
Okay, but I'm allergic to horses.

14:39.497 --> 14:43.480
It is my pleasure to award you
this honorary diploma.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.117
Congratulations.

14:48.033 --> 14:49.673
[Tracy cries]

14:49.673 --> 14:51.236
Take a breath, Mr. Jordan.

14:53.289 --> 14:55.364
[Glass breaks]

14:55.364 --> 14:58.109
Tracy: Who wants my autograph? [Cries]

14:58.109 --> 15:00.587
So you can see how important
this is to me. Are you in?

15:00.587 --> 15:02.926
Uh, I'm in. I think it will be fun.

15:03.766 --> 15:07.281
I actually played a kidney in my fifth
grade school play... with this loser.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.687
I'm in, but when
Costello's not looking

15:08.687 --> 15:10.327
I'm going to punch him
in the back of the head.

15:10.327 --> 15:11.331
Fair enough.

15:11.331 --> 15:12.436
Hey, Jack...

15:12.436 --> 15:15.984
are you doing my musical benefit idea?
Because I'd love to be...

15:15.984 --> 15:17.114
Uh, no, it didn't work out.

15:17.189 --> 15:21.073
Jenna, you know my European friends,
uh, Rokus and, uh, Shandelay.

15:21.073 --> 15:21.742
[With accent]: Hello.

15:21.742 --> 15:22.677
[With accent]: Pleased to meet.

15:29.275 --> 15:30.680
Thank you.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.287
Cerie, I'm going out for a couple of hours.

15:32.287 --> 15:33.425
Okay, I'll just, um...

15:33.425 --> 15:36.405
I'm meeting a book agent about
writing a dealbreaker book.

15:36.405 --> 15:38.208
He's gonna take me to lunch
wherever I want to go.

15:39.418 --> 15:41.058
Do you know if there's a
sit-down Quizno's in Midtown?

15:41.058 --> 15:42.050
Never mind.

15:43.435 --> 15:45.075
Liz Lemon, you dumb bitch.

15:45.075 --> 15:46.515
What?

15:46.515 --> 15:48.054
Here's the reason I don't want
to go on that family vacation.

15:48.054 --> 15:49.293
It's a working farm

15:49.293 --> 15:50.330
and I'm the only one

15:50.330 --> 15:53.209
whose hands are big enough to
guide the bull during mating.

15:53.209 --> 15:55.083
Yeah, well... dealbreaker.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.222
Shut up!

15:56.222 --> 15:57.862
There you are,
you stupid cracker.

15:57.862 --> 16:01.009
You know why I get a hotel room?
To poop in peace.

16:01.009 --> 16:02.515
No kids banging
on the door.

16:02.515 --> 16:05.093
No phones ringing. It's my time...

16:05.093 --> 16:07.202
every Tuesday and
Thursday at 3:00 P.M.!

16:07.202 --> 16:11.186
I don't know why I only go twice a week.

16:11.186 --> 16:13.462
That's what Angie should be worried about!

16:13.462 --> 16:14.634
Pete: You've gotta stop giving advice.

16:14.634 --> 16:16.374
You don't know what you're talking about.

16:16.374 --> 16:18.115
No, I'm not stopping. I'm gonna write a book.

16:18.115 --> 16:19.956
I have to. This is my next step.

16:19.956 --> 16:21.897
What are you talking about?

16:21.897 --> 16:23.270
This job isn't going to last forever, Pete.

16:23.270 --> 16:25.541
T.G.S. has two years left, tops.

16:26.818 --> 16:28.459
Pete, how am I going to live?

16:28.459 --> 16:30.434
I only have $300 million.

16:30.434 --> 16:33.681
[Laughs] This...
this is crazy, Jack.

16:33.681 --> 16:34.987
I've never seen
anything like this.

16:34.987 --> 16:36.660
And I was at "We Are the Pizza."

16:36.660 --> 16:38.200
Well, I thought I had to do something.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.409
Once I found that I wasn't a match,
I felt like I'd let you down.

16:40.409 --> 16:42.280
You couldn't let me down, Jack.

16:45.330 --> 16:47.406
[Coughs] Get a room!
- Yeah, get a room.

16:47.406 --> 16:49.548
Tracy: A high school graduate.

16:49.548 --> 16:52.059
Do you know what this means?
Grizz, Dotcom, Ken?

16:52.059 --> 16:53.632
We're going to college!

16:53.632 --> 16:57.717
[Thinking]: And so began the craziest
summer of my life.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.926
How'd you say that without
moving your mouth?

16:59.926 --> 17:01.261
Say what?

17:02.403 --> 17:04.243
Lemon, how are you?

17:04.243 --> 17:05.516
You know what?

17:05.516 --> 17:09.397
I'm good. I got a book deal,
a free sandwich in my pocket

17:09.397 --> 17:11.273
and I have this weird loose
feeling in my shoulders.

17:11.273 --> 17:13.517
What is that?

17:13.517 --> 17:14.821
It's either happiness
or osteoporosis.

17:14.821 --> 17:16.590
I think it's happiness.

17:17.835 --> 17:19.136
You're getting yours.

17:21.015 --> 17:23.156
Jack, what have you done?

17:23.156 --> 17:27.877
I called in every favor I had.
He's my dad, Liz.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.350
Oh, my God! Sheryl Crow!

17:29.350 --> 17:32.396
We were best friends in elementary school.

17:32.396 --> 17:34.439
Hi, Sheryl.

17:34.439 --> 17:35.476
Announcer: We're live in three...

17:35.476 --> 17:36.883
I'll talk to her later.

17:36.883 --> 17:40.196
[Piano plays]

17:40.196 --> 17:42.974
# Sometimes life brings pain and strife #

17:42.974 --> 17:46.423
# And all seems wrong #

17:46.423 --> 17:51.845
# That is when you find a friend
and write a song #

17:51.845 --> 17:55.929
# So give the gift of giving #

17:55.929 --> 17:59.009
# Give it far and give it wide #

17:59.009 --> 18:04.566
# Take a leap, reach down deep inside #

18:04.566 --> 18:09.085
# And just give a kidney #

18:09.085 --> 18:12.065
# To a father or a dad #

18:12.065 --> 18:13.738
# Just give a kidney #

18:13.738 --> 18:16.015
# Oh #

18:16.015 --> 18:19.663
# We hear it doesn't really hurt that bad #

18:19.663 --> 18:22.275
# And we know you'll want to give it #

18:22.275 --> 18:24.986
# To a super human being #

18:24.986 --> 18:26.626
# So get it done #

18:26.626 --> 18:28.434
# We just need one #

18:28.434 --> 18:31.982
# For Milton Greene #

18:31.982 --> 18:35.464
# This country has 600 million kidneys #

18:35.464 --> 18:37.572
# And we really only need half #

18:37.572 --> 18:40.887
# That leaves about 300 million kidneys #

18:40.887 --> 18:44.201
# Do the math #

18:44.201 --> 18:47.013
# Oh, Milton Greene, Milton Greene #

18:47.013 --> 18:50.628
# Milton Greene, Milton Greene,
Milton Greene #

18:50.628 --> 18:52.704
# He needs a kidney #

18:52.704 --> 18:54.645
# Milton Greene, don't ask why, he could die #

18:54.645 --> 18:57.892
# If you don't call today #

18:57.892 --> 19:01.173
Listen, when someone starts
talking in the middle of a song

19:01.173 --> 19:03.014
you know it's serious.

19:03.014 --> 19:04.687
So, give Milton a kidney.

19:04.687 --> 19:07.634
We all believe in this cause so much
that we're doing it for free...

19:07.634 --> 19:08.772
except for Sheryl.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.680
That's right, I'm the only one getting paid.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.655
And only three of us are drunk.

19:12.655 --> 19:16.538
Milton Greene needs a kidney,
just like I need this beard.

19:16.538 --> 19:18.245
You don't want to know what's under here.

19:18.245 --> 19:21.459
And while you don't have two beards,
you do have two kidneys.

19:21.459 --> 19:25.175
Think of it this way: if I had $2,
I'd give you one. Wouldn't I?

19:25.175 --> 19:27.585
I'm one of the drunk ones.

19:27.585 --> 19:29.192
# They say that two is better than one #

19:29.192 --> 19:31.100
# But sometimes one is better than two #

19:31.100 --> 19:33.745
# If you had two heads,
you'd wish you had one #

19:33.745 --> 19:35.183
# How is this different? #

19:35.183 --> 19:38.130
# If you had two dogs attacking you,
you'd want just one #

19:38.130 --> 19:39.402
# There, we proved a point #

19:39.402 --> 19:41.511
# Oh, Milton Greene, Milton Greene #

19:41.511 --> 19:45.025
# Milton Greene, Milton Greene,
Milton Greene #

19:45.025 --> 19:47.168
# He needs a kidney #

19:47.168 --> 19:49.075
# Milton Greene, don't ask why, he could die #

19:49.075 --> 19:52.122
# If you don't call today #

19:52.122 --> 19:55.737
# He needs a kidney #

19:55.737 --> 19:59.320
# No, he doesn't need a hand #

19:59.320 --> 20:01.562
# He just needs a kidney #

20:01.562 --> 20:07.855
# A hand would be an even
harder thing to give #

20:07.855 --> 20:09.428
# If you can give a kidney #

20:09.428 --> 20:13.212
We sure had quite a year.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.622
What are you talking
about? It's May.

20:15.622 --> 20:16.826
Shh.

20:16.826 --> 20:19.203
# Do some good
(Do some good) #

20:19.203 --> 20:20.878
# We pass the cup
(Pass the cup) #

20:20.878 --> 20:22.585
# We stitch it up
(Stitch it up) #

20:22.585 --> 20:24.627
# We do some good #

20:24.627 --> 20:26.066
# Yeah, yeah #

20:26.066 --> 20:27.204
# We pass the cup #

20:27.204 --> 20:29.481
# And stitch it up
(Stitch it up) #

20:29.481 --> 20:31.890
# We do some good #

20:31.890 --> 20:33.833
# Oh, yeah #

20:33.833 --> 20:37.146
[Audience cheers]

20:37.146 --> 20:39.087
Cyndi: Yeah, that's good.

20:39.791 --> 20:45.771
