$20,000.

13:04.136 --> 13:06.571
I'll take the other car back for you.

13:06.672 --> 13:08.439
So what's up with the big pit?

13:08.540 --> 13:11.142
Bob Paris is building a pool
just like he said he would.

13:11.243 --> 13:13.244
You were there.

13:15.481 --> 13:17.682
It looks... looks pretty deep.

13:17.783 --> 13:19.617
Where... Where are the plans?

13:19.718 --> 13:22.420
Um, I don't have them, but
I have a call in to Bob.

13:22.521 --> 13:27.759
The worker said that it's
a pool and there are plans.

13:27.860 --> 13:30.562
Okay.

13:30.663 --> 13:32.263
Get me the pink slip on the Mustang?

13:32.364 --> 13:35.166
Sure... I cannot believe
you did this for me.

13:35.267 --> 13:37.735
That you realized how
much this car meant to me.

13:37.836 --> 13:39.203
Yeah, well, it's... I'm a cop.

13:39.305 --> 13:40.204
I'm observant.

13:40.306 --> 13:42.607
That is so nice.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.709
Why did you do it?

13:47.413 --> 13:51.182
It's... I don't know, I just, uh...

13:51.283 --> 13:53.384
Couldn't stand the thought
of you being sad about it,

13:53.485 --> 13:55.019
and I could do something

13:55.120 --> 13:59.123
or fix it or whatever that means.

14:11.770 --> 14:13.037
Okay, I'm gonna get the pink slip.

14:13.138 --> 14:14.806
Thank you. Aah!

14:38.597 --> 14:40.765
Sheriff Romero is here to see you.

14:40.866 --> 14:42.567
Kismet.

14:42.668 --> 14:44.302
I was actually just going to
call you... we need to talk.

14:44.403 --> 14:45.670
What the hell's going
on with that giant hole

14:45.771 --> 14:47.305
outside Norma Bates's house?

14:47.406 --> 14:49.507
You can't build a pool without a hole.

14:49.608 --> 14:51.442
That's not the hole you dig for a pool.

14:51.543 --> 14:54.212
It's certainly something she'll remember.

14:54.313 --> 14:56.214
Don't screw with her. Don't do it.

14:56.315 --> 14:57.515
That's why I came with her the other day,

14:57.616 --> 15:00.118
so she's not hanging out there all alone.

15:00.219 --> 15:02.353
I need to tell you a few
things I found out recently.

15:02.454 --> 15:04.655
You may want to have a seat.

15:16.268 --> 15:18.469
I had a little session with a therapist

15:18.570 --> 15:21.506
that Norma Bates has been screwing.

15:21.607 --> 15:25.309
You think you know her,
Alex, but you don't.

15:25.411 --> 15:27.278
I mean, she's a kinky bitch.

15:27.379 --> 15:31.816
She's going out and getting
new clothes... sexy stuff.

15:31.917 --> 15:33.051
Going to bars.

15:33.152 --> 15:34.819
Picking up men.

15:34.920 --> 15:38.523
Yeah, I really don't care
about her personal life, Bob.

15:38.624 --> 15:41.559
Alex. Listen to me.

15:41.660 --> 15:43.628
I'm... I did a little digging.

15:43.729 --> 15:46.631
I found out a few things, like...

15:46.732 --> 15:49.233
how she was screwing your deputy,

15:49.334 --> 15:50.835
and then he ended up dying on her property,

15:50.936 --> 15:56.441
but the police report says that
you killed him in self-defense.

15:56.542 --> 15:59.177
Okay.

16:02.114 --> 16:03.448
Do you want to know what
she told the therapist

16:03.549 --> 16:06.584
that she's been sleeping with?

16:06.685 --> 16:10.354
That her son Norman killed his father.

16:10.456 --> 16:12.490
Apparently he blacks out and gets violent,

16:12.591 --> 16:18.496
but she lied and said it was an accident.

16:18.597 --> 16:23.734
She's using you to protect
herself and her family.

16:30.375 --> 16:33.578
But what does any of this
have to do with you, Bob?

16:33.679 --> 16:35.413
I'm just trying to protect the town

16:35.514 --> 16:38.416
that we both grew up in.

16:38.517 --> 16:40.618
I need an ally.

16:40.719 --> 16:45.389
I want you back on my team.

16:45.491 --> 16:47.892
Yeah. I'm not interested.

16:50.762 --> 16:52.296
I've known you a long time, Alex.

16:52.397 --> 16:54.065
I can read your face.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.601
You think about it, get back to me.

17:06.718 --> 17:09.020
Norman!

17:09.087 --> 17:10.721
We're gonna have to get
some fencing or something.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.289
Th... th... I mean, this is dangerous.

17:12.357 --> 17:15.992
What if we have kids at the motel?

17:16.094 --> 17:17.795
Where have all the workers gone?

17:17.896 --> 17:19.530
I don't know.

17:19.631 --> 17:21.965
You know, you're the manager.
Just go get some fencing,

17:22.067 --> 17:23.968
and for the love of God, don't fall in.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.573
Hello, Dylan.

18:02.674 --> 18:03.974
Hello, Emma.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.676
I like how

18:05.777 --> 18:07.111
we're being all formal with each other now.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.780
Uh...

18:09.881 --> 18:12.650
Yeah, look, I just... I wanted
to... to call and check on you

18:12.751 --> 18:14.919
and see how you're feeling.

18:15.020 --> 18:16.053
Are you cured?

18:16.154 --> 18:17.188
Yeah, totally.

18:17.289 --> 18:18.255
No more CF.

18:20.058 --> 18:23.227
I'm... I'm okay. I'm
actually at the motel today.

18:23.328 --> 18:25.729
My dad says I can work a
few hours here and there.

18:25.797 --> 18:27.264
That's good.

18:27.332 --> 18:29.300
Yeah, because I'm... I'm
sure nothing is more fun

18:29.401 --> 18:32.136
than... than working in that office, so...

18:34.873 --> 18:37.041
Oh, will you be home later?

18:37.142 --> 18:38.909
Actually, that... That's why I was calling.

18:38.977 --> 18:42.746
I'm gonna be on the road
for a few days, so...

18:42.814 --> 18:46.250
I-I'm... I'm doing delivery
to make some extra money.

18:46.351 --> 18:47.718
Oh.

18:47.819 --> 18:50.521
What do you need the money for? The farm?

18:50.622 --> 18:52.690
Yeah.

18:52.791 --> 18:56.494
Yeah, it's, uh... It's expensive,

18:56.595 --> 18:57.795
you know, building the...

18:57.896 --> 18:59.730
The barn and... and stuff, so...

19:02.734 --> 19:05.636
It sure is a beautiful little spot, Dylan.

19:05.737 --> 19:07.872
Yeah, it is.

19:07.973 --> 19:11.709
Anyways, um, I, uh... I just...

19:11.810 --> 19:14.979
I wanted to call and
tell you that, and, um...

19:15.080 --> 19:18.649
let you know that if you
needed me for anything,

19:18.750 --> 19:21.752
well, I'm completely unavailable, so...

19:21.853 --> 19:23.621
Oh, well, thank you for that.

19:23.722 --> 19:25.756
I'll be sure not to have an
emergency while you're gone.

19:28.026 --> 19:31.161
Perfect. Perfect.

19:31.263 --> 19:35.099
All right, take care of yourself, and um...

19:35.200 --> 19:37.668
I'll see you in a few days.

19:37.769 --> 19:39.036
Okay.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.738
Safe travels.

19:40.839 --> 19:43.240
Thanks.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.609
Bye.

19:45.677 --> 19:47.378
Hmm. Bye.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.281
How's it going?

20:24.349 --> 20:27.351
Yeah, no, almost... Almost done.

20:29.821 --> 20:33.691
It's just, you know, doesn't
look much like a pool.

20:33.792 --> 20:38.095
It's... it's a pit, and I don't understand.

20:42.968 --> 20:44.768
Sorry, I...

20:44.869 --> 20:48.606
I... I know I haven't been around
much the last few days, I...

20:48.707 --> 20:51.642
Hey, do you want to
just go to a movie later?

20:54.012 --> 20:57.281
I think we should talk.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.716
You've been through a lot lately.

20:58.817 --> 21:00.284
Uh, I don't know if you know this,

21:00.385 --> 21:05.155
but I... I was there with
you and Dylan up at the house

21:05.256 --> 21:08.759
the night your mom got mad and left.

21:08.827 --> 21:10.094
Oh, I see.

21:10.195 --> 21:11.629
Norman, please don't take it like that.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.631
I just didn't realize you had these issues.

21:13.732 --> 21:17.067
No, I know, it hardly makes
me good boyfriend material.

21:17.168 --> 21:19.770
It's not about that, Norman.

21:19.838 --> 21:21.238
I think if you're honest with yourself,

21:21.306 --> 21:24.642
we were never meant to
be together that way.

21:24.743 --> 21:26.076
It just never felt normal.
It felt like we were

21:26.177 --> 21:29.279
trying to force it because
we both wanted it to work.

21:29.381 --> 21:32.082
And it's okay, maybe I
just don't do it for you.

21:32.183 --> 21:34.218
You know, you always seem
distracted, like I could never

21:34.319 --> 21:37.187
have you there in the moment.

21:37.289 --> 21:39.089
It always seemed like
you were with someone else

21:39.190 --> 21:41.191
even when you were with me.

21:44.029 --> 21:46.230
But we will always be friends.

21:46.331 --> 21:49.767
You know, I... I will always
love you and care about you.

21:53.304 --> 21:54.304
Yeah.

21:54.406 --> 21:59.610
Uh...

21:59.711 --> 22:04.748
I, uh... am gonna go back up to
the house for a... for a while.

22:04.849 --> 22:08.419
- I'll just finish up later.
- Okay.

22:48.059 --> 22:51.061
The world's a lonely place
sometimes, isn't it, Juno?

23:27.056 --> 23:29.291
Hi, Alex.

23:29.392 --> 23:30.358
I'm just heating up some leftovers.

23:30.426 --> 23:33.395
You want to come in?

23:38.568 --> 23:40.302
What?

23:52.315 --> 23:53.548
You... You remember
the first time that I...

23:53.616 --> 23:57.953
I talked to you on this porch, Norma?

23:58.054 --> 23:59.254
It's kind of funny 'cause you were standing

23:59.355 --> 24:00.589
right over there, and...

24:00.690 --> 24:03.992
And you were lying to me, and...

24:04.093 --> 24:07.529
What are you talking about?

24:07.630 --> 24:10.031
Do you want to come in?

24:10.099 --> 24:13.935
Did you talk to Bob Paris?

24:14.003 --> 24:15.337
Yeah, and it... I...

24:15.438 --> 24:17.272
I talked to Bob, but I
don't want to come in,

24:17.373 --> 24:20.275
and I want to ask you something, and...

24:20.376 --> 24:23.111
And don't tell me a story, okay?

24:23.212 --> 24:26.381
Tell me the truth.

24:26.482 --> 24:29.117
I know what your impulse is
gonna be, but d-don't do it.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.620
- Just this once.
- Just this once?

24:36.392 --> 24:40.629
H-How did your husband die?

24:42.031 --> 24:43.832
You know how he died.

24:43.933 --> 24:45.333
In an accident in the garage.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.235
A heavy shelf fell on him.

24:47.303 --> 24:56.144
♪ ♪

24:56.245 --> 24:58.046
You have a last chance, Norma.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.287
That is the truth.

25:13.162 --> 25:15.163
Good-bye, Norma.

25:18.601 --> 25:21.503
Alex...

25:21.604 --> 25:23.605
Alex.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.609
Alex!

25:51.634 --> 25:52.867
What's wrong, Norman?

25:52.969 --> 25:55.170
Don't turn the light on.

25:55.271 --> 25:56.438
I have something to tell you,

25:56.539 --> 26:00.308
but I'd rather tell you in the dark.

26:00.376 --> 26:02.377
What is it?

26:05.648 --> 26:08.350
Are you afraid of me?

26:08.451 --> 26:12.153
I'll never be afraid of you, Norman.

26:12.255 --> 26:16.057
The thing that James Finnegan said to me.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.325
I can't get it out of my head.

26:17.393 --> 26:20.028
It's so awful.

26:20.129 --> 26:23.298
Mostly 'cause I'm afraid it's true,

26:23.399 --> 26:25.166
and I need to tell someone,

26:25.268 --> 26:26.601
and I trust you more than anyone,

26:26.669 --> 26:28.136
but it might make you hate me.

26:28.204 --> 26:29.537
It might make you afraid of me

26:29.639 --> 26:31.172
because it's made me afraid of myself.

26:31.274 --> 26:34.342
Tell me, Norman.

26:34.410 --> 26:37.345
He thinks...

26:37.413 --> 26:41.316
He thinks that I'm attracted to you...

26:41.417 --> 26:42.884
sexually.

26:42.952 --> 26:44.319
I got so mad when he said it.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.987
I wanted to kill him,

26:46.055 --> 26:50.091
but then the more I thought about it, I...

26:50.192 --> 26:53.295
I mean, I love you so much,
and I am so close to you.

26:53.396 --> 26:54.562
I just think that sometimes...

26:54.664 --> 26:55.964
Norman, stop it right now.

26:56.065 --> 26:59.367
You are not attracted to me.

26:59.435 --> 27:00.936
- Don't look at me.
- Norman.

27:01.037 --> 27:03.371
Norman, listen to me.

27:03.439 --> 27:06.975
It is completely normal.

27:07.076 --> 27:09.277
You... you're... You
are developing sexually.

27:09.345 --> 27:10.345
You're just confused.

27:10.446 --> 27:13.081
I-it... it's silly.

27:13.149 --> 27:15.150
Honey, we... we're...

27:15.251 --> 27:17.052
We're just people.

27:17.153 --> 27:19.854
We... we're on some level
like animals, instinctual.

27:19.956 --> 27:21.423
You're a man. I'm a woman,

27:21.524 --> 27:23.391
so maybe you notice my
breasts once in a while.

27:23.492 --> 27:24.959
Big deal. It's freaking normal.

27:25.061 --> 27:26.294
It doesn't mean you're weird

27:26.362 --> 27:28.163
or that there's anything wrong with you.

27:28.264 --> 27:30.231
- It doesn't?
- No!

27:30.333 --> 27:32.334
No.

27:32.435 --> 27:36.538
What makes us not animals
is that we make choices.

27:36.639 --> 27:39.174
You can't help what you
think, what your impulses are.

27:39.275 --> 27:41.443
We all have crazy ones. I do.

27:41.544 --> 27:46.247
It's... I guarantee you
people dream about sleeping

27:46.349 --> 27:49.284
with their parents, their
teachers, their dogs.

27:49.385 --> 27:51.152
It's just how we're wired.

27:51.253 --> 27:54.189
Sex is confusing, so you
need to stare it in the face,

27:54.290 --> 27:56.791
and you need to say, "That is stupid."

27:56.892 --> 27:57.993
It is stupid!

27:58.094 --> 27:59.794
It's stupid.

27:59.895 --> 28:02.397
I should have never let that
pseudo doctor talk to you.

28:02.465 --> 28:03.999
So much for therapy.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.302
Listen to me.

28:07.403 --> 28:10.839
I don't ever want you to
second guess anything about me.

28:10.940 --> 28:15.210
We are solid. We love each other.

28:15.311 --> 28:17.545
Oh, you are my whole world.

28:17.646 --> 28:20.849
You are my whole world.
You always have been.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.150
Hug me, dammit!

28:22.218 --> 28:24.486
- Come on, this is silly.
- Mother!

28:24.587 --> 28:26.488
You gotta get this out of your head.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.428
Don't ever let anyone's
words come between us.

28:33.496 --> 28:36.064
They're meaningless.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.299
This is the only thing that's real.

28:38.401 --> 28:41.102
Mm. You and me.

29:20.503 --> 29:22.370
Emma, hey.

29:22.471 --> 29:25.707
Hey, I was just dropping something off.

29:25.808 --> 29:28.310
You know Dylan's out of town, right?

29:28.411 --> 29:30.412
Mm-hmm.

29:30.513 --> 29:34.182
So you just thought you'd stop by and...

29:34.283 --> 29:36.151
Whoa, did you make those?

29:36.252 --> 29:40.255
I did, but there's no pot in
them, so don't get excited.

29:42.191 --> 29:43.959
I just wanted to leave these for Dylan.

29:44.060 --> 29:47.462
He's had a tough couple of days recently.

29:47.563 --> 29:50.932
I... I had no idea.

29:51.033 --> 29:52.934
Hey, I know it's been a while,

29:53.035 --> 29:54.903
but I was meaning to hit you up.

29:55.004 --> 29:59.007
I just wasn't sure if you'd
be into it or, you know. I...

30:01.010 --> 30:03.278
Gunner, it was fun hanging
out with you last summer,

30:03.379 --> 30:06.815
but I'm having a hard time,
health-wise, right now,

30:06.916 --> 30:09.084
and I just really need to focus on that.

30:09.185 --> 30:11.319
You know the last thing
on my mind these days is...

30:11.420 --> 30:13.421
Is anything romantic.

30:16.259 --> 30:17.826
I'm sorry, Emma. I mean, let me know

30:17.927 --> 30:18.893
if there's anything I can do.

30:18.995 --> 30:21.930
Aw, thank you, Gunner.

30:22.031 --> 30:23.498
You're sweet.

30:23.599 --> 30:24.599
Mm.

30:56.098 --> 30:59.367
Where are they?

30:59.468 --> 31:01.970
You sure it's the right place?

31:02.071 --> 31:04.439
It's the only phone booth
on this stretch of road.

31:09.178 --> 31:11.413
You done stuff like this before?

31:11.514 --> 31:13.381
Some.

31:18.888 --> 31:20.889
Why do you have a warrant?

31:23.626 --> 31:27.629
You don't have to tell me.
I-I figured you didn't want to.

31:29.398 --> 31:33.468
Look, there was a shipment.

31:33.569 --> 31:37.472
You know, a truck. Easy money,

31:37.573 --> 31:42.210
But the driver, he was, uh, jumpy.

31:42.311 --> 31:47.015
He didn't know how to
stay calm, so he freaked.

31:47.116 --> 31:49.250
You know, when things go wrong fast,

31:49.351 --> 31:52.420
you got to react.

31:52.521 --> 31:54.122
You killed him?

31:56.125 --> 31:59.260
No, but...

31:59.362 --> 32:00.495
he got beat up really bad.

32:16.212 --> 32:18.012
Hello?

32:29.892 --> 32:31.092
Yeah?

32:31.193 --> 32:33.194
Where's Chick?

32:35.631 --> 32:37.065
Where are you?

32:37.166 --> 32:38.700
Why isn't Chick with you?

32:38.801 --> 32:41.169
He couldn't make it, and he sent us.

32:41.270 --> 32:42.437
He should have told us that.

32:42.538 --> 32:44.172
Yeah, fine. Whatever, man.

32:44.273 --> 32:48.810
Are we gonna do this, or,
um... are we gonna go back?

32:48.911 --> 32:50.311
Drive ahead 2 kilometers.

32:50.412 --> 32:51.880
Go left through town.

32:51.981 --> 32:53.414
When you get to Emmett Street, turn right.

32:53.516 --> 32:55.450
There's a group of barns down there.

32:55.551 --> 32:58.419
Back your truck in
towards the furthest barn.

33:02.958 --> 33:05.960
We can still go back.

33:06.061 --> 33:08.930
No.

33:09.031 --> 33:12.033
I want the money.

33:12.134 --> 33:14.302
All right.

33:14.403 --> 33:16.404
Let's go.

33:52.808 --> 33:55.143
Chick couldn't make it tonight.

33:55.244 --> 33:57.712
Convenient.

33:57.813 --> 33:58.880
We don't know anything about that.

33:58.981 --> 34:01.249
We're just here to do a delivery.

34:01.350 --> 34:03.351
Look, is this really necessary?

34:03.452 --> 34:06.221
'Course you don't
know anything about that.

34:06.322 --> 34:08.255
I'm gonna give you some education.

34:08.357 --> 34:11.726
You don't change your plans
without telling your partners.

34:11.827 --> 34:13.228
Look, man, we got your merchandise.

34:13.329 --> 34:14.262
Why... Why don't we just
finish this, all right?

34:14.362 --> 34:17.130
We'll finish it.

34:17.233 --> 34:19.033
Don't move.

34:36.085 --> 34:38.520
Face the truck. On your knees.

34:42.257 --> 34:43.958
Let's move it!

35:03.245 --> 35:04.345
See, it's all good.

35:04.446 --> 35:06.281
We just... We got no issues, man.

35:06.382 --> 35:08.983
We're just here to drop off and pick up.

35:12.421 --> 35:14.022
Okay, we're cool here.

35:14.123 --> 35:15.423
Just need to unload the guns

35:15.524 --> 35:17.759
and just give us the money. We're good.

35:17.860 --> 35:19.227
We're not sending you back with the money.

35:19.328 --> 35:20.728
Meaning what?

35:20.829 --> 35:22.931
Chick Hogan's a piece of shit.

35:23.032 --> 35:24.899
Three other guys bought guns
from him in the last year,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.335
and now they're all in prison.

35:27.436 --> 35:30.371
So we're taking the guns,
and we didn't bring the money

35:30.472 --> 35:34.375
because we planned on blowing
Chick Hogan's brains out,

35:34.476 --> 35:37.445
but like I said, he's not here.

35:37.546 --> 35:40.748
You are.

35:40.849 --> 35:44.986
And this guy is going back with a message.

35:53.896 --> 35:55.763
You're the message.

35:57.199 --> 35:58.199
Get down!

36:04.907 --> 36:06.107
Agh!

36:14.550 --> 36:15.450
Aah!

36:21.023 --> 36:22.957
Come on.

36:25.394 --> 36:26.728
Come on, we've
got to get out of here.

37:03.232 --> 37:06.400
Regina, get me Carl Davila at the DEA.

37:23.785 --> 37:24.786
James!

37:29.591 --> 37:31.225
James!

37:31.326 --> 37:34.795
Come on!

37:34.897 --> 37:36.497
Oh, my god. What happened to you?

37:36.598 --> 37:38.432
I can't talk, Norma.
Just... just... just go away.

37:38.534 --> 37:39.500
You have to talk to me!

37:39.601 --> 37:41.636
What is going on?

37:41.737 --> 37:43.771
I got the shit kicked out of me.

37:43.872 --> 37:47.408
I almost got killed by men who
wanted information about you.

37:47.476 --> 37:49.143
Well, what'd you tell them?

37:49.244 --> 37:51.412
I told them everything!

37:51.480 --> 37:53.414
Not about Norman.

37:53.482 --> 37:55.283
Tell me you didn't say
anything about Nor...

37:55.384 --> 37:57.185
You said that I could tell you
anything and it would be safe.

37:57.286 --> 37:58.619
I'm sorry, Norma.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.488
- Oh, my god.
- I got to get out of here.

38:00.556 --> 38:02.223
I'm leaving this town.
I'm never coming back.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.625
Y-y-you should get out
of this town yourself,

38:04.726 --> 38:09.197
but then, Norma, don't
ever, ever contact me again.

38:14.770 --> 38:15.770
Norman!

38:25.414 --> 38:27.615
Norman, put that down. I
have to tell you something.

38:27.683 --> 38:29.417
- What's wrong, Mother?
- Something happened.

38:29.518 --> 38:31.719
Something bad, and it's my fault,

38:31.787 --> 38:35.556
and I... I'm sorry, but we
have to deal with it, it's real.

38:35.657 --> 38:37.692
What did you do, Mother?

38:37.793 --> 38:39.527
The night I ran away,

38:39.595 --> 38:42.063
I wound up at James Finnegan's house,

38:42.164 --> 38:44.498
and I was so upset that I...

38:44.600 --> 38:47.468
Oh, all this stuff sort
of just vomited out of me,

38:47.569 --> 38:50.471
and I told him things.

38:50.572 --> 38:51.739
What sort of things?

38:51.840 --> 38:55.843
I told him what happened to your father.

38:57.779 --> 39:01.048
That he died in an accident.

39:01.149 --> 39:03.150
No, Norman.

39:06.521 --> 39:09.123
You told that person about that?

39:09.224 --> 39:10.391
About me?

39:10.492 --> 39:13.461
I was worried about
you, and he was a doctor,

39:13.528 --> 39:15.763
but he told someone, and now...

39:15.864 --> 39:17.565
And now this bad man knows.

39:17.633 --> 39:20.334
This... this man who...
Who wants to hurt us,

39:20.435 --> 39:23.771
and he got James to tell him
stuff about me, about... about us.

39:23.872 --> 39:25.273
What bad man?

39:25.374 --> 39:27.208
Okay, none of this is making any sense.

39:27.276 --> 39:30.611
I can't believe that you're
standing here telling me that...

39:30.712 --> 39:31.712
No, no, maybe... Maybe you're not.

39:31.813 --> 39:32.813
Maybe you are not.

39:32.915 --> 39:34.315
Are... are you really here?

39:34.383 --> 39:35.750
Yes, I'm here, and it happened!

39:35.817 --> 39:37.351
Well, then how could you do that?

39:37.452 --> 39:38.719
Because, Norman, you have no idea

39:38.820 --> 39:40.821
what it's like to be your mother!

39:40.922 --> 39:42.590
To see you have these blackouts!

39:42.658 --> 39:44.191
To worry about you night and day!

39:44.293 --> 39:45.760
It's killing me! It's killing me!

39:45.827 --> 39:47.828
You're gonna kill me, Norman!

39:56.672 --> 39:58.839
I see.

39:58.940 --> 40:02.944
I'm sorry, I did not mean
that. I am just upset.

40:09.418 --> 40:12.520
Okay, you need to lay low for a while.

40:12.587 --> 40:14.755
Okay, I'm... I'm just gonna handle this.

40:14.856 --> 40:16.590
I will fix it. I promise.

40:16.692 --> 40:18.726
Okay, just please be
careful. Lock the doors.

40:18.827 --> 40:21.729
Don't go anywhere, and I
will be back as soon as I can.

40:24.833 --> 40:31.305
♪ ♪

40:31.406 --> 40:33.541
Don't fall apart, Norman.

40:33.608 --> 40:37.278
If anyone tries to hurt
you, I will kill 'em.

40:37.346 --> 40:39.246
I got your back.
