WEBVTT

00:01.730 --> 00:03.960
MAN: You have my word,
and my word is gold.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.969
WOMAN: He got away with
beating her. He is not gonna
get away with killing her.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.468
MAN #2:
I like to win.
This case is a loser.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.673
MAN #3: Tell Lou and Judy
I want them to be the guardians
of my children.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.200
ANNOUNCER:
The People v. 0.]. Simpson.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.707
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:17.010 --> 00:20.343
FX presents The Americans.

00:24.420 --> 00:26.183
Previously
on "the Americans"...

00:26.220 --> 00:28.814
PAIGE: I'm not stupid. I know
there's something going on.

00:28.860 --> 00:29.986
You're out
in the middle of the night.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.486
The phone rings,
and you're gone.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.327
Just please tell me.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.157
We work for our country...

00:35.200 --> 00:36.997
The Soviet Union.

00:37.030 --> 00:39.362
PHILIP:
If you do tell anyone...

00:39.400 --> 00:41.163
We will go to jail --
for good.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.169
They're (sniffles) they're not
who they say they are.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.859
They're not...Americans.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.347
I want to arrange a trip

00:56.390 --> 00:58.585
for Elizabeth to see her mother
one last time.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.349
GABRIEL:
I wish it were possible,

01:00.390 --> 01:01.914
but we both know
that it isn't.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.587
The FBI found the bug.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.757
Martha knows about me.

01:05.790 --> 01:08.588
I saw you today staring
into your coffee mug

01:08.630 --> 01:11.190
for a minute, straight.

01:11.230 --> 01:13.698
I can't take it.
They're not gonna let up

01:13.740 --> 01:15.867
until they find the person
that put that pen there.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.233
I-I am working on it,
and I would do anything...

01:19.280 --> 01:20.406
(yells)

01:20.440 --> 01:22.078
...to protect you.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.378
HOWARD:
You're so stuck in your mind,

01:27.420 --> 01:29.945
but what you're just learning

01:29.990 --> 01:32.550
is that these feelings
in your gut

01:32.590 --> 01:34.251
are just as important --

01:34.290 --> 01:37.453
more important
than all the shit in your head.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.969
(footsteps running)

01:43.000 --> 01:44.922
(boy speaking Russian)

01:51.470 --> 01:52.937
-(grunts)
-Ohh!

02:00.480 --> 02:04.917
(inhales deeply, sighs)

02:04.950 --> 02:06.952
(yells)

02:06.990 --> 02:08.651
(thud
din
Nyet! g)

02:38.190 --> 02:40.283
You okay?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.652
Yeah.

02:44.990 --> 02:48.448
You were right
about Martha.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.127
I have
to tell her about Gene

02:50.170 --> 02:51.990
before she finds out
at work.

02:59.910 --> 03:01.400
(sighs)

03:05.350 --> 03:08.911
**

03:54.130 --> 03:57.099
**

04:04.740 --> 04:07.903
Hey.

04:11.610 --> 04:13.214
What time is it?

04:13.250 --> 04:15.912
It's late.

04:15.950 --> 04:18.919
Mm.

04:25.130 --> 04:27.598
I'm glad you're here.

04:27.630 --> 04:31.726
I need to talk to you.

04:31.770 --> 04:35.592
Is everything all right?

04:38.110 --> 04:39.930
No.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.665
(sighs)

05:08.700 --> 05:11.498
In the next day or two,

05:11.540 --> 05:14.134
you're gonna get some
disturbing news at work.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.511
Gene Craft is dead.

05:19.550 --> 05:23.145
What do you mean?

05:23.190 --> 05:26.614
What -- what happened?

05:26.660 --> 05:30.619
He'll be found
in his apartment.

05:30.660 --> 05:33.458
I-It'll look
like he killed himself.

05:33.500 --> 05:37.869
I don't --
I don't understand.

05:37.900 --> 05:43.702
The recorder will be found
in his apartment.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.474
(gasps)

05:48.510 --> 05:50.000
The recorder?

05:52.680 --> 05:54.341
My recorder?

05:57.020 --> 06:00.683
It was the only way
to protect you.

06:03.190 --> 06:05.181
Oh, no.

06:10.030 --> 06:12.328
(sobs)

06:12.370 --> 06:14.235
He's dead?

06:14.270 --> 06:17.398
Gene is dead?

06:17.440 --> 06:20.034
(gasps)
(crying) oh, no.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.672
No, no, no, no.

06:21.710 --> 06:23.849
No, I didn't --
I didn't agree to this!

06:23.880 --> 06:25.040
I don't want this!

06:25.080 --> 06:27.241
-Martha --
-How could you do that?!

06:27.280 --> 06:28.542
No, no.
Stay away.

06:28.580 --> 06:29.717
I'm sorry, Martha.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.684
Stay away.
Stay away.

06:31.720 --> 06:35.053
What have you done?

06:35.090 --> 06:37.422
What have I done?

06:39.930 --> 06:41.352
(gasps)

06:41.400 --> 06:43.527
It's my fault.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.094
I killed him.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.768
-No.
-Oh, I did.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.937
It's the truth.

06:47.970 --> 06:50.029
Gene is dead
because of me.

06:50.070 --> 06:52.038
It's not
because of you, Martha.

06:52.070 --> 06:54.937
I did it.
-(sobs)

06:54.980 --> 06:58.245
I said I would do anything
I could to protect you,

06:58.280 --> 06:59.440
to keep you safe.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.368
Oh, my God...

07:01.420 --> 07:02.546
(sobbing)

07:02.590 --> 07:03.887
-Martha --
-Oh!

07:03.920 --> 07:05.581
No,dont.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.080
Please.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.283
Don't touch me.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.843
**

08:05.650 --> 08:06.719
CHILD: Okay, mom!
WOMAN: Come back at 4:00,
okay, hon?

08:08.820 --> 08:10.139
(door closes)

08:29.340 --> 08:31.661
Jet lag?

08:31.710 --> 08:33.007
I've been up since 2:00.

08:33.040 --> 08:37.704
Oh.
I'll take some of that.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.969
I heard someone leave
around like 3:00.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.046
Your father
had to go to work.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.479
Is he coming back?

08:46.520 --> 08:48.351
He'll meet me
at the office.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.329
What's he doing,
exactly?

08:54.360 --> 08:57.523
He's meeting someone.

09:03.370 --> 09:07.500
It's...what we call
a source.

09:07.540 --> 09:09.701
He might get
some information.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.015
Is it dangerous?

09:13.050 --> 09:17.180
No.
I-It's more...

09:17.220 --> 09:20.348
_ It's more about
getting people to trust you.

09:20.390 --> 09:21.857
To help them understand

09:21.890 --> 09:24.688
that you want the same thing
that they want,

09:24.730 --> 09:27.858
which is to make the world
a safer place for everyone.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.688
Not everyone sees it that way,
so it's all done in secret.

09:31.730 --> 09:34.733
Did you eat?

09:34.770 --> 09:36.567
You want me
to make some eggs?

09:36.610 --> 09:39.534
No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

09:39.570 --> 09:42.107
Okay.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.579
**

09:59.800 --> 10:02.121
I'm glad
you got some sleep.

10:06.470 --> 10:09.439
Are you gonna be able
to go to work today?

10:09.470 --> 10:12.268
I have to.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.646
Oh...

10:30.960 --> 10:32.450
(water runs)

10:35.160 --> 10:38.766
Martha, I'm not gonna be
able to come back here...

10:38.800 --> 10:42.759
_ even when
the Investigation ends.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.766
Stan Beeman
was SUSplClOUS.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.028
He could come back.

10:50.850 --> 10:54.638
But it won't change
anything between us.

10:59.650 --> 11:03.188
We'll be together at my place
just as often.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.161
Well, you getting up?

11:14.200 --> 11:17.658
No. I might
just skip work today.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.338
I don't really feel like
seeing anybody there.

11:20.380 --> 11:24.202
I thought you liked playing
with all the boys at the office.

11:24.250 --> 11:28.516
You know, driving around in
your cars and arresting people.

11:28.550 --> 11:30.814
I used to.
Not so much anymore.

11:30.850 --> 11:32.340
Everybody there
kind of hates me now.

11:32.390 --> 11:35.655
Hates you?
Stan Beeman?

11:35.690 --> 11:37.021
How is that
even pOSSIble?

11:37.060 --> 11:38.823
I know.
It's hard to believe, right?

11:38.860 --> 11:40.327
mm-hmm.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.990
But I do sometimes rub people
the wrong way.

11:45.030 --> 11:50.366
Well (clears throat)
did you screw something up?

11:50.410 --> 11:55.530
Well, that's a matter
of interpretation.

11:55.580 --> 11:58.572
My boss thinks
I should be executed.

11:58.610 --> 12:00.510
But his boss thinks
I should get a medal.

12:00.550 --> 12:04.213
Well, you need to talk it
through with your boss.

12:04.250 --> 12:07.754
Be clear and direct_
about what you're feeling.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.849
If his problems
or lack of clarity

12:09.890 --> 12:12.051
are causing him to stand
in your way,

12:12.090 --> 12:15.218
then your truth and clarity
will blow right through him.

12:15.260 --> 12:18.923
Uh-huh.

12:18.970 --> 12:22.599
FBI doesn't exactly
work like that.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.064
ALL:
I pledge allegiance to the flag

12:26.110 --> 12:28.874
of the United States of America

12:28.910 --> 12:32.038
and to the republic
for which it stands

12:32.080 --> 12:35.868
one nation under God,
indivisible,

12:35.920 --> 12:39.242
with liberty and justice
for all.

12:39.290 --> 12:45.422
(students chattering)

12:45.460 --> 12:48.918
TEACHER: Good morning, class.
Okay.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.463
If you are in field hockey,

12:51.500 --> 12:56.767
they're gonna be in the lower
field, not the upper field.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.131
GABRIEL: The Centre would like
to know why I don't have

12:59.170 --> 13:00.728
the kind of relationship
with you

13:00.780 --> 13:02.805
that keeps something like this
from happening.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.239
Gabriel, i-it was --

13:05.280 --> 13:06.918
and they're right.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.577
You lied to me.

13:08.620 --> 13:11.612
There's no other way
to look at it.

13:11.650 --> 13:14.585
I told you they should go,
and all you said was no.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.451
When we disagree
on something,

13:16.490 --> 13:19.084
the next step isn't
to do it behind my back.

13:19.130 --> 13:21.928
It makes them wonder
ifI can do my job.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.760
If you could've seen Paige
with her, you'd understand.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.268
It was the right thing
to go.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.938
For a lot of reasons.

13:29.970 --> 13:33.428
I came _out of retirement
to work With you, to help you.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.176
But I don't want to be put
in this position

13:36.210 --> 13:38.144
between you
and the Centre.

13:38.180 --> 13:41.149
If I can't trust something
like this won't happen again,

13:41.180 --> 13:43.319
I'll go back to retirement
in Sergach.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.215
We can get you
another handler.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.323
Make a decision.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.521
We want you to stay.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.391
Both of you?

14:01.870 --> 14:06.637
Well, I'll take you
at your nod.

14:06.670 --> 14:10.140
There is something
(sighs) else

14:10.180 --> 14:11.306
that I've kept you out of.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.569
But, um...
I can't anymore.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.648
There are certain
very powerful weapons...

14:24.690 --> 14:25.850
biological.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.824
We're not allowed
to make them.

14:27.860 --> 14:29.327
We've signed treaties.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.158
But we think _the Americans
are making them,

14:32.200 --> 14:33.667
so we make them, too.

14:33.700 --> 14:38.160
One of us has been (sighs)
getting American samples

14:38.210 --> 14:42.408
of pathogens
for many years.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.499
He signaled
about a week ago,

14:44.550 --> 14:47.769
but when I tried to meet him,
I caught surveillance.

14:50.550 --> 14:54.008
If he's clean, you'll pick up
the next package from him

14:54.060 --> 14:56.585
and find out_ what the hell
is gomg on.

14:56.620 --> 15:01.057
Anyone who gets near this
has to be vaccinated.

15:05.470 --> 15:10.703
I'm very sorry.
I tried to keep you out of it.

15:10.740 --> 15:14.198
This is for a kind of meningitis
you could get

15:14.240 --> 15:16.970
from the last two samples
he got for us.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.788
No dead drops.
Keep it in your custody.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.082
Who is he?

15:28.120 --> 15:29.553
William.

15:29.590 --> 15:31.751
How long
has he been here?

15:31.790 --> 15:33.451
Longer than you.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.626
He's running this alone?

15:34.660 --> 15:35.820
Yes.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.758
He had a partner,
but it didn't work out.

15:42.800 --> 15:47.476
Not everyone's
as lucky as you two.

15:47.510 --> 15:49.000
(shudders)

15:59.620 --> 16:02.919
When they first showed me
my room,

16:02.960 --> 16:04.587
Ithought
it was so peaceful.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.326
(clears throat)

16:07.360 --> 16:08.497
So quiet.

16:08.530 --> 16:11.966
Yeah. _
Well, not exactly a prison.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.662
No.
Not for me.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.134
I just wanted
to rest there.

16:17.170 --> 16:18.603
To sleep on the bed.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.768
Use the hairbrush.

16:21.810 --> 16:23.004
(sighs)

16:23.050 --> 16:24.779
I know this sounds silly,

16:24.810 --> 16:28.109
but I thought I could stay
there for a long time.

16:28.150 --> 16:32.109
(scoffs)
Happily.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.459
I'm sorry.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.481
I know it's different
for you.

16:39.660 --> 16:42.322
(speaks Russian)

16:46.000 --> 16:47.194
(sighs)

16:47.240 --> 16:51.131
I'm a shitty husband,
Nina.

16:51.170 --> 16:53.479
I cheated on my wife.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.501
-Well --
-That's how they got me.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.542
They knew I would be
with her that night.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.343
If I'd been home
where I belonged...

16:59.380 --> 17:01.678
They would've gotten you
another way.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.484
Maybe.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.182
But I think about my bedroom
back home,

17:07.220 --> 17:08.881
with my wife there...
-It's okay --

17:08.920 --> 17:10.558
It's just
I-I know what you mean.

17:10.590 --> 17:13.320
That seems peaceful now.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.225
I wish I could live
that way again.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.364
Anton Lazarevich.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.719
(speaks Russian)

17:33.950 --> 17:35.508
PAIGE: I shouldn't
have said anything.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.211
PASTOR TIM: You needed
to tell someone, Paige.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.581
(sighs)

17:38.620 --> 17:41.350
No one can bear
this sort of thing alone.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.914
I __
They trusted me.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.518
You're in church, Paige.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.052
This is a place where you
never have to hide the truth.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.868
What am I gonna do?

17:54.900 --> 17:57.903
(sighs)

18:00.070 --> 18:04.404
Look, Paige,
as unusual as this is,

18:04.450 --> 18:07.248
I am used
to hearing secrets.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.077
I-I know
this may sound crazy,

18:09.120 --> 18:11.611
but d-do you think
your parents would be open

18:11.650 --> 18:13.618
to coming in and -- and...
-What?

18:13.660 --> 18:16.049
...talking, the four of us,
confidentially?

18:16.090 --> 18:17.455
-No!
-Okay.

18:17.490 --> 18:20.459
But your confusion and fear
is not gonna go away

18:20.500 --> 18:22.718
no matter how much
you talk to me.

18:22.760 --> 18:26.389
If people are getting hurt,
we have a responsibility.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.239
You think everything
is about talking,

18:28.270 --> 18:29.464
but they're not like that.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.058
I've lived with them
for all these years.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.259
I know.

18:32.310 --> 18:37.407
We can't tell
anybody else...

18:37.450 --> 18:40.942
ever.

18:43.950 --> 18:46.919
Okay.

18:46.950 --> 18:50.454
So, let's focus on
what's best for you.

18:50.490 --> 18:52.754
You've said all along

18:52.790 --> 18:57.295
that you wanted to understand
who they are.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.469
Well, do you think
you could ask them

18:59.500 --> 19:01.593
to tell you more
about what they do?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.803
I guess.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.003
I could try.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.975
Good. Good.

19:11.010 --> 19:13.342
And then we'll figure out
what to do next.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.974
(sighs)

19:25.390 --> 19:28.450
When did you get Henry
that cologne?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.127
I didn't.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.627
Who did then?

19:31.670 --> 19:34.161
I don't -- I don't know.
He must've bought it.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.498
-It's disgusting.
-Yeah, I know.

19:36.540 --> 19:38.167
It's poisoning
the whole upstairs.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.837
I had to open up
all the windows.

19:39.870 --> 19:44.546
I told him deodorant is fin--
He doesn't need cologne.

19:44.580 --> 19:45.706
He doesn't even shave.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.240
I know.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.352
Let's get dessert
someplace else.

20:24.220 --> 20:26.188
Not now.

20:26.220 --> 20:28.711
You sure?

20:28.760 --> 20:30.921
Mm-hmm.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.929
If we don't go now,
he'll get too far away.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.078
ELIZABETH: So, you did or
you didn't see something?

20:53.110 --> 20:55.874
It's hard to say.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.287
Well, you either did
or you didn't, Philip.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.709
(sighs)

21:01.760 --> 21:03.421
I'm, uh...

21:03.460 --> 21:05.451
I'm not sure what I saw.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.219
I had a bad feeling.

21:07.260 --> 21:09.421
Had a bad feeling?

21:09.460 --> 21:11.394
Yeah.

21:11.430 --> 21:15.230
Based on everything
that I was taking in.

21:15.270 --> 21:17.568
So, we were clear to go,
and we broke off,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.737
and you didn't
actually see anything?

21:19.770 --> 21:21.909
Gabriel broke off a meeting
with the same guy

21:21.940 --> 21:23.908
because he thought
he saw surveillance.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.748
It is pretty likely that
they're out here, so...

21:26.780 --> 21:28.748
He did say be careful.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.418
Gabriel said he saw a guy
in a blue jacket

21:30.450 --> 21:31.917
a block and a half away
from the target

21:31.950 --> 21:34.919
who he identified
as a pOSSlble surveillant.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.588
That's why we were
called in with Hans.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.427
What did you see?

21:39.460 --> 21:41.325
I'm telling you,
it didn't feel right.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.661
You okay?

22:01.480 --> 22:03.983
Is something wrong?

22:04.020 --> 22:06.944
Is something going on
that I need to know about?

22:06.990 --> 22:08.309
I'm fine.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.504
(Indistinct
conversations in Russian)

22:41.860 --> 22:44.556
(boys yelling in Russian)

22:46.190 --> 22:48.556
PHILIP:
There were two of them.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.899
Older than me.

22:51.930 --> 22:54.694
They used to steal stuff
from me.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.696
HOWARD:
And you stopped them.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.002
Mm.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.008
How do you feel?

23:00.040 --> 23:01.234
(breathing heavily)

23:03.580 --> 23:05.002
Angry.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.006
Anger is a concept.

23:07.050 --> 23:11.043
How do you feel
in your body?

23:13.720 --> 23:16.553
BOY: Hey!
(yelling in Russian)

23:32.570 --> 23:33.707
-(grunts)
-(yells)

23:33.740 --> 23:35.708
Strong.

23:35.740 --> 23:38.072
Powerful?

23:38.110 --> 23:40.544
I don't --
I don't know.

23:40.580 --> 23:43.219
Why?

23:43.250 --> 23:45.286
I, uh...

23:46.290 --> 23:47.917
(yells)

23:47.960 --> 23:49.757
what?

23:49.790 --> 23:52.588
(sighs)
I don't know.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.227
You got in a fight.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.421
You were a kid.
What's the big deal?

23:58.470 --> 23:59.619
It's not just that.

23:59.670 --> 24:01.968
BOY: Nyet!

24:02.000 --> 24:03.262
(yelling)

24:03.300 --> 24:04.938
(thudding)

24:10.780 --> 24:13.817
-Why?
-Because --

24:17.790 --> 24:20.418
(thudding)

24:20.450 --> 24:22.918
I can't do anymore.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.257
Why?

24:24.290 --> 24:26.588
'Cause I didn't need
to hit him that much.

24:26.630 --> 24:28.291
But you did.

24:28.330 --> 24:29.490
(sighs)

24:29.530 --> 24:31.760
and to forgive yourself,

24:31.800 --> 24:35.338
you have to create a space
for it to exist.

24:35.370 --> 24:38.931
You're confusing the feelings
with the event itself.

24:38.970 --> 24:40.437
But they're different.

24:40.470 --> 24:42.335
The kid
was bullying you.

24:42.380 --> 24:44.598
Why isn't he asking you
for forgiveness?

24:44.650 --> 24:47.301
Did you ever talk
to him about it?

24:50.820 --> 24:53.618
No.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.959
Why not?

24:56.990 --> 24:58.855
(breathing heavily)

25:01.660 --> 25:03.321
(rock clatters)

25:05.670 --> 25:09.458
Because he moved away.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.663
(applause)

25:27.350 --> 25:28.681
(indistinct conversations)

25:28.720 --> 25:30.722
He's not saying that,
if you forgive yourself,

25:30.760 --> 25:33.183
that means that you think
that beating a kid up is okay.

25:33.230 --> 25:37.667
He's just saying that spending
the energy pushing it away

25:37.700 --> 25:40.362
is what, you know,
is making you angry.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.493
It's not really anger,
even.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.201
Then what is it?

25:44.240 --> 25:47.835
I just feel bad.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.509
You have a lot weighing
you down, don't you?

25:51.550 --> 25:52.699
Yeah.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.012
Yeah.

25:54.050 --> 25:56.416
You need more support.
-(sighs)

25:56.450 --> 25:58.748
going to EST,
not telling Elizabeth?

25:58.790 --> 26:00.849
You need her.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.414
Being dishonest
with her

26:02.460 --> 26:04.678
is like being dishonest
with yourself.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.550
And there's a limit
to how much progress

26:06.590 --> 26:08.228
you can make
if you are not honest

26:08.260 --> 26:10.091
about what's going on
in your own life.

26:10.130 --> 26:11.859
There's a limit
to how much progress

26:11.900 --> 26:14.198
I can make if I tell her,
because she would kill me.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.060
(laughs)

26:16.100 --> 26:18.261
(indistinct conversations)

26:24.150 --> 26:27.301
I'm just gonna
borrow your...

26:31.790 --> 26:34.782
(Typewriter keys clacking,
quiet conversations)

26:34.820 --> 26:38.256
(telephone rings)

27:11.990 --> 27:13.582
Sir?

27:13.630 --> 27:16.599
Call Walter Taffet.

27:16.630 --> 27:18.996
Tell him to meet me
in the vault now.

27:42.820 --> 27:43.980
(knock on door)

28:00.040 --> 28:01.200
(sighs)

28:25.030 --> 28:28.033
**

28:40.250 --> 28:42.673
WOMAN: I said I appreciated
all the effort,

28:42.720 --> 28:45.587
but $6,000 (chuckles) is
just a drop in the bucket.

28:45.620 --> 28:46.848
That doesn't g--

28:46.890 --> 28:48.517
(tape fast-forwarding)

28:48.560 --> 28:50.926
MURRAY: How should I know?
I'm 86 years old.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.224
I can barely remember
the doctor's name.

28:53.260 --> 28:54.852
PASTOR TIM: I don't_ think
you should be gomg

28:54.900 --> 28:56.026
to these appointments
alone, Mr. Murray.

28:56.060 --> 28:57.721
(loud thudding)

28:57.770 --> 28:59.067
the church has volunteers
who could drive you --

28:59.100 --> 29:00.897
(tape recorder clicks)

29:10.610 --> 29:13.078
I just keep picturing her
walking in there

29:13.110 --> 29:15.544
and spitting
the whole thing out.

29:15.580 --> 29:18.219
I thought everything
was good in Germany.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.547
It was.

29:19.590 --> 29:24.050
But she's...complicated.

29:24.090 --> 29:27.218
(sighs)
She's just so...

29:27.260 --> 29:28.727
What?

29:28.760 --> 29:30.967
(sighs)

29:31.000 --> 29:33.628
different.

29:33.670 --> 29:35.763
We have to go.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.290
Yeah.

30:25.150 --> 30:26.640
Keep driving.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.288
Green station wagon.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.491
Had its turn signal on
at the corner.

30:34.530 --> 30:35.895
Came straight through.

32:41.120 --> 32:44.954
(clattering, keys jingling)

32:44.990 --> 32:47.356
(lock turns)

32:55.640 --> 32:57.164
MARTHA: Clark?

33:00.010 --> 33:02.808
(sighs)

33:02.840 --> 33:04.603
(sobs)
They know.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.447
They know
that he's dead.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.448
(sniffles)

33:08.480 --> 33:12.439
Gene is...

33:12.490 --> 33:15.311
(sighs)

33:15.360 --> 33:18.625
Everybody's shocked
and...

33:18.660 --> 33:20.457
(sniffles)

33:20.490 --> 33:23.459
and running around
like crazy.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.661
You're safe.
We're together.

34:05.610 --> 34:06.929
(sniffles)

34:11.750 --> 34:13.047
Did he know?

34:13.080 --> 34:15.913
Gene, did he...

34:15.950 --> 34:19.044
Did he know that
it was gonna happen?

34:19.090 --> 34:22.389
No.

34:25.060 --> 34:26.857
I did everything I could

34:26.890 --> 34:31.520
to make it (sighs)
easier for him.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.390
Easier?

34:37.440 --> 34:39.704
Was he in pain?

34:39.740 --> 34:42.402
No.
It was fast.

34:42.440 --> 34:43.600
Very fast.

34:48.250 --> 34:51.071
(sighs)

34:58.790 --> 35:04.399
His apartment,
it was, um...

35:04.430 --> 35:07.729
It was filled with toys.

35:07.770 --> 35:11.729
Like a kid.

35:11.770 --> 35:15.672
Robot action figures.

35:22.680 --> 35:28.152
I'm -- I'm glad
that you told me.

35:28.190 --> 35:29.782
Iam. I...

35:32.360 --> 35:36.251
I have to know
everything...

35:36.300 --> 35:38.461
Even if it's hard.

35:46.470 --> 35:50.679
I've been -- I keep
having these memories

35:50.710 --> 35:53.440
from when I was a kid.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.845
Just dumb stuff.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.769
But you know how some
of it makes you think

35:57.820 --> 36:02.450
"I wonder if this is why
I act this way?

36:02.490 --> 36:07.325
Or why I'm so angry
about that?"

36:16.170 --> 36:19.958
Thank you
for telling me that.

36:20.010 --> 36:22.001
It's better.

36:22.040 --> 36:26.079
You'll see.

36:29.420 --> 36:33.811
What?

36:33.850 --> 36:35.317
What is it?

36:35.360 --> 36:39.649
I...
I did Wh-what I did...

36:39.690 --> 36:42.818
to take you
out of danger.

36:42.860 --> 36:45.590
I won't put you back in.

36:56.610 --> 37:00.239
We have to decide things
together.

37:03.050 --> 37:06.679
Okay.

37:06.720 --> 37:12.181
They want reports
and assignments

37:12.230 --> 37:15.222
for a particular
surveillance team.

37:23.300 --> 37:26.736
(men yelling in Russian)

38:34.840 --> 38:36.330
Eh...

38:55.230 --> 38:58.620
MAN: I didn't know him
very well, so...

38:58.670 --> 39:01.468
it's all kind of
a shock to me.

39:01.500 --> 39:05.163
WOMAN:
I still can't believe it.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.529
Anything?

39:06.570 --> 39:08.333
MAN #2: We're running
through those files now.

39:11.550 --> 39:14.815
I had a beer
with him once.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.511
You could tell
he was a disturbed guy.

39:16.550 --> 39:17.972
MAN #3:
I know what you mean.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.988
I-I always got a strange feeling
from him, too.

39:20.020 --> 39:22.011
It's like, Gene, this weird
computer geek, right?

39:22.060 --> 39:24.085
(Indistinct conversations)

39:55.720 --> 40:00.521
Martha, I know
you liked Gene a lot.

40:00.560 --> 40:05.293
I didn't know him that well,
but I liked him, too.

40:07.300 --> 40:10.736
I guess you never really
know a person, do you?

40:13.470 --> 40:15.074
Yeah.

40:20.310 --> 40:23.473
**

42:18.360 --> 42:20.669
(copier whirring)

42:20.700 --> 42:23.237
PHILIP: From Martha.

42:23.270 --> 42:26.398
Surveillance assignments.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.247
There was no one on him
that first night.

42:32.280 --> 42:35.738
So I was
imagining things.

42:39.950 --> 42:41.850
You weren't.

42:41.890 --> 42:44.518
Team member number three,

42:44.560 --> 42:47.529
March 10th,
green station wagon.

42:47.560 --> 42:49.926
It's a good thing
we broke off.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.120
Yeah.

42:54.430 --> 42:57.194
No one on him tonight.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.561
Or Sunday.

42:59.610 --> 43:04.035
We should go tonight.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.868
(sighs)

43:07.910 --> 43:09.719
You sure you're okay?

43:09.750 --> 43:11.069
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:40.040 --> 44:43.669
Didn't I see you here
walking a dog a few nights ago?

44:43.710 --> 44:47.806
Yes. I have
two black Labradors.

44:47.850 --> 44:49.841
Where's Gabriel?

44:49.880 --> 44:52.314
He called us in in case
we had to handle something.

44:52.350 --> 44:54.386
Did you know
you were under surveillance?

44:54.420 --> 44:56.149
No, I just
thought random people

44:56.190 --> 44:58.556
couldn't stop staring at me
because I'm so handsome.

44:58.590 --> 45:03.323
My laboratory just got a new
contract from Fort Detrick.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.897
That's why I sent the signal
to Gabriel in the first place.

45:05.930 --> 45:08.319
It's come along with a shitload
of FBI surveillance --

45:08.370 --> 45:10.338
all the scientists,
probably, technicians...

45:10.370 --> 45:11.667
Fort Detrick?

45:11.700 --> 45:17.002
Department of Defense,
their bioweapons lab.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.871
Keep this
in the freezer.

45:18.910 --> 45:22.038
Get it to Gabriel
within 48 hours.

45:22.080 --> 45:23.342
What is it?

45:23.380 --> 45:27.180
It's Burkholderia mallei.

45:27.220 --> 45:29.757
Causes a disease
called glanders.

45:30.890 --> 45:34.223
The inoculation we got was
against a kind of meningitis.

45:34.260 --> 45:37.354
(laughs)
This is to meningitis

45:37.400 --> 45:41.029
what bubonic plague is
to a runny nose.

45:41.070 --> 45:43.698
Gabriel and his friends
at the Centre

45:43.740 --> 45:47.039
have been waiting my whole
Goddamn life for this.

45:47.070 --> 45:50.073
Tell them
I send it with love.

45:53.750 --> 45:56.810
(dog barking in distance)

46:04.420 --> 46:07.753
**

46:37.490 --> 46:40.425
Stan.

46:40.460 --> 46:42.257
Everything okay?

46:42.300 --> 46:44.928
STAN: Yeah.
Yeah, just, uh...

46:44.970 --> 46:47.996
Hey, Philip, can I talk
to you alone for a second?

46:48.030 --> 46:49.338
Yeah, sure.

46:49.370 --> 46:50.928
Boy talk?

46:50.970 --> 46:52.460
Yeah.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.449
What, uh...what's up?

47:00.480 --> 47:05.281
Tori, uh, saw you
with Sandra.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.514
What?

47:06.550 --> 47:09.610
At a restaurant?

47:09.660 --> 47:12.959
We got dessert --

47:12.990 --> 47:18.018
She said...you were very
intimate with each other.

47:18.060 --> 47:20.961
Intimate?
I don't know what that means.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.297
Are you screwing my wife?

47:22.340 --> 47:23.967
(sighs) No.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.831
God, no. I --

47:25.870 --> 47:27.132
You're lying.

47:27.170 --> 47:29.968
Don't lie to me, Philip.

47:30.010 --> 47:31.705
I'm not lying!
I swear, we're just friends.

47:31.740 --> 47:33.002
Then what were you doing
with her?

47:33.050 --> 47:34.347
You're out with her,
you never told me?

47:36.350 --> 47:39.649
I went back to EST.
All right?

47:39.690 --> 47:41.646
And she was there.
We went out after.

47:41.690 --> 47:43.681
That's all.
We've always been friends.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.221
Jesus! Stop!

47:48.230 --> 47:51.552
You don't think to tell me
'cause you went back to EST?

47:51.600 --> 47:53.158
I don't know.

47:53.200 --> 47:54.997
It's weird, obviously,
seeing you, seeing her.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.929
I do-- I-I don't know
what to say.

47:59.270 --> 48:00.828
Screw you, Philip.

48:00.870 --> 48:02.098
(sighs)

48:11.050 --> 48:13.245
(garage door creaking)

48:50.290 --> 48:51.655
(light clicks)

49:43.510 --> 49:45.171

WOMAN:

50:10.600 --> 50:12.500
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!

50:14.170 --> 50:15.933
I think that we
should cut a deal.

50:17.510 --> 50:20.707
I ain't trying
to be respectful.
I'm trying to win.

50:36.430 --> 50:37.795

Aaah!

Some of us
have to be artists.

50:51.580 --> 50:53.707
You know,
I lost my virginity
