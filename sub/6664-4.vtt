00:02.235 --> 00:04.203
Adult adam: <i> Growing up,</i>
<i> my mom was many things,</i>

00:04.205 --> 00:06.338
<i> But cool was definitely</i>
<i> not one of them.</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:08.307
<i> She would seriously leave</i>
<i> the house like that.</i>

00:08.309 --> 00:12.077
You're not seriously
gonna leave the house
like that, are you?

00:12.079 --> 00:13.979
Of course not.

00:17.250 --> 00:17.783
(clicks tongue)

00:17.785 --> 00:22.421
<i> She was an absolute stickler</i>
<i> for her uncool rules...</i>

00:24.157 --> 00:26.158
Curfew is 11:00.

00:26.160 --> 00:26.625
It's 11:04.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.627
Adult adam:
<i> Even the way she worried</i>
<i> about us was uncool.</i>

00:28.629 --> 00:30.429
Do you know what could
happen in four minutes?

00:30.431 --> 00:33.132
You could drown, choke,
eat poison berries.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.166
And if any
of that happens,

00:34.168 --> 00:35.567
Then I have failed
as a mother.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.403
Adult adam: <i> But the most</i>
<i> uncool thing of all</i>

00:37.405 --> 00:39.772
<i> Was how much our mom</i>
<i> loved us.</i>

00:39.774 --> 00:41.907
I made these people, me.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.643
I made them with my body.
(chuckles)

00:44.645 --> 00:46.278
Oh!
There's this one now.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.313
Hey, erica,
it's your mom.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.015
Erica, it's your mother!

00:50.017 --> 00:52.351
Hi, erica
and erica's friends!

00:52.353 --> 00:54.920
Oh, my god.
Mom, what are you wearing?

00:54.922 --> 00:55.587
Isn't this adorable?

00:55.589 --> 01:00.959
That kiosk uses
technology to put
memories on a t-shirt.

01:00.961 --> 01:01.593
It's totally cool.

01:01.595 --> 01:05.497
Oh, jill, look.
There's your mom, too.
Louise!

01:05.965 --> 01:08.967
Adult adam:
<i> Louise rubin, the cool mom.</i>

01:08.969 --> 01:11.503
<i> There's always one,</i>
<i> hip, youthful,</i>

01:11.505 --> 01:12.404
<i> And wouldn't be caught dead</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:14.406
<i> In a shirt</i>
<i> with her kids' faces on it.</i>

01:14.408 --> 01:18.177
<i> Yep, she was</i>
<i> the anti-beverly.</i>

01:18.445 --> 01:20.546
Oh, look what
you've got on.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.081
(chuckles) oh.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.615
What are the chances,
huh?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.818
Are you here
to celebrate choctoberfest

01:25.820 --> 01:27.686
At the fudge emporium,
too?

01:27.688 --> 01:29.254
Nope. Just hanging
with the girls.

01:29.256 --> 01:33.225
Which girls?
These girls.
We just did our nails.

01:33.227 --> 01:33.659
Oh...

01:33.661 --> 01:36.228
So, you drove them here
and had to wait in the car

01:36.230 --> 01:38.263
While they
enjoyed themselves, huh?

01:38.265 --> 01:39.932
Mom, she's hanging
with us, okay?

01:39.934 --> 01:41.333
We're here to get
the new madonna album.

01:41.335 --> 01:44.536
Don't you just love...
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.572
When you said
you were going to the mall

01:46.574 --> 01:48.574
With your friend louise,
I thought that meant

01:48.576 --> 01:50.809
A girl from your class,
not mrs. Rubin.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.478
Ugh, I don't want them
to call me that.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.646
It makes me feel
like such a mom, you know?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.415
Oh, psst. Yeah.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.184
That's why I like
erica's friends to
call me bev.

01:59.186 --> 02:01.520
Sounds good, bev.
Don't like it.
Go back.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.022
Okay, this was fun.
See you at dinner?

02:04.024 --> 02:06.825
Yep. Got to fix
some din-din.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.360
Hmm.
(chuckles)

02:08.362 --> 02:09.928
Chicken's not
gonna pot-pie itself,

02:09.930 --> 02:12.030
Know what I'm sayin'?
(chuckles)

02:12.032 --> 02:12.965
Cool.
Nice catching up, bev.

02:12.967 --> 02:16.068
Okay, see you
on the flip-flop!
(chuckles)

02:16.070 --> 02:16.935
The nerve
of that woman,

02:16.937 --> 02:19.371
Cold chillin'
with my daughter
at the mall.

02:19.373 --> 02:22.174
Erica should be
cold chillin' with me,
not her!

02:22.176 --> 02:23.542
What are you
talking about?

02:23.544 --> 02:26.145
You cold chill
with erica all the time.

02:26.147 --> 02:26.678
No.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.380
I only feed her soup
when she's sick

02:28.382 --> 02:31.850
And give her
boric-acid drops when
she's got pinkeye.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.686
I'm in the trenches doing
the important, boring stuff.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.954
But when it comes time
for fun,

02:35.956 --> 02:38.190
Well, she heads
straight to louise rubin.

02:38.192 --> 02:41.493
Wait. We're talking
about louise rubin here?

02:41.495 --> 02:42.928
Oh, she's the coolest.

02:42.930 --> 02:43.662
What?
Yeah!

02:43.664 --> 02:46.265
She'll cut
the top off her shirt

02:46.267 --> 02:47.933
Just to show
her shoulder.

02:47.935 --> 02:48.967
Well, I can do that.

02:48.969 --> 02:52.604
See? I'm just as cool
as the next mom.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.273
What are you doing?

02:54.275 --> 02:57.409
I'm trying
to expose my shoulder!

02:57.944 --> 03:00.212
Poop. I just
stretched it out.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.314
Stop stretching
your sweater.

03:02.482 --> 03:03.582
Okay.

03:03.584 --> 03:03.949
Stop!

03:03.951 --> 03:05.918
Well, I got to stretch
my sweater out

03:05.920 --> 03:07.519
So I can
show my shoulder.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.021
(mumbling)
why won't you stop?

03:09.023 --> 03:13.192
I don't know
why you can't stop,
but you need to stop!

03:13.194 --> 03:14.393
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:14.395 --> 03:19.298
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

03:20.633 --> 03:21.633
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:21.635 --> 03:25.204
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:25.206 --> 03:27.506
Adult adam:
<i> It was October 22,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

03:27.508 --> 03:31.443
<i> And I was spending</i>
<i> the night with my</i>
<i> apple ii plus.</i>

03:31.445 --> 03:33.679
<i> It had a whopping</i>
<i> 16k of ram,</i>

03:33.681 --> 03:37.115
<i> Dot matrix printer,</i>
<i> 32-bit color graphics,</i>

03:37.117 --> 03:39.751
<i> And badass,</i>
<i> thrill-a-minute video games</i>

03:39.753 --> 03:41.887
<i> Like</i> "oregon trail."

03:42.355 --> 03:44.156
(beeping)

03:44.158 --> 03:44.923
Balls!
(door opens)

03:44.925 --> 03:46.358
(door closes)
<i> while I spent time</i>
<i> with my computer,</i>

03:46.360 --> 03:48.961
<i> Barry was hanging</i>
<i> with his new crew of dudes.</i>

03:48.963 --> 03:51.530
<i> They called themselves</i>
<i> the "jenkintown posse."</i>

03:51.532 --> 03:53.198
Jtp!
All: Jtp!

03:53.200 --> 03:54.266
<i> ...Jtp for short.</i>

03:54.268 --> 03:57.002
<i> They were older, cooler,</i>
<i> and lived on the edge.</i>

03:57.004 --> 03:59.071
<i> There was jeff schwartz,</i>
<i> the madman...</i>

03:59.073 --> 04:01.139
Potato chips on a sandwich?
I'm crazy!

04:01.141 --> 04:03.242
(laughing)
<i> andy cogan, the ladies' man</i>

04:03.244 --> 04:05.244
<i> Who never let his height</i>
<i> get in the way.</i>

04:05.246 --> 04:08.080
(sighs) can a brother
get a steppin' stool?

04:08.082 --> 04:08.914
<i> ...And naked rob,</i>

04:08.916 --> 04:10.349
<i> One of those dudes</i>
<i> who loved getting nude.</i>

04:10.351 --> 04:12.584
This tank top's
chafing me.
I got to take it off.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.152
Don't! Come on.
Adam: Yo.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.154
What you wild cats
up to tonight?

04:16.156 --> 04:20.859
Whatever it is,
you know it'll involve
some ladies! Aah!

04:20.861 --> 04:21.793
How many ladies?

04:21.795 --> 04:23.895
So many
it's gonna be crazy!

04:23.897 --> 04:25.497
(all laughing)
oh, man. How crazy?

04:25.499 --> 04:27.866
So crazy someone
may get in-jured!

04:27.868 --> 04:29.334
Barry: Yo, baby!
It's on, baby!
Whoo! Whoo-whoo-whoo!

04:29.336 --> 04:32.704
Details! Name some of
the crazy stuff
you guys did!

04:32.706 --> 04:34.306
You know how our school's
always trying

04:34.308 --> 04:36.041
To get their hands
on germantown high mascot?

04:36.043 --> 04:38.677
You stole
frankie the falcon?

04:39.245 --> 04:40.379
Well,
I mean, not yet.

04:40.381 --> 04:44.449
But once we do it,
we'll be kings
of the school.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.084
Jtp!
Jtp!

04:46.086 --> 04:47.886
All: Jtp!

04:48.187 --> 04:48.754
Dude...

04:48.756 --> 04:52.958
You can't say "jtp"
unless you're in the jtp.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.993
Adult adam:
<i> A man could only dream.</i>

04:54.995 --> 04:56.428
Jtp out!

04:56.430 --> 04:59.831
<i> To the jtp, I was just</i>
<i> a nerd obsessed</i>
<i> with computers.</i>

04:59.833 --> 05:03.001
<i> That all changed the day</i>
porky's ii <i> was sold out</i>

05:03.003 --> 05:05.837
<i> And they were forced</i>
<i> to see</i> wargames,

05:05.839 --> 05:06.872
<i> A movie about</i>
<i> a kid who hacks his way</i>

05:06.874 --> 05:10.442
<i> To better grades</i>
<i> and almost blows up</i>
<i> the world.</i>

05:10.444 --> 05:11.677
(computer reading)

05:11.679 --> 05:16.014
<i> Oh.</i>
<i> Suddenly, they all realized</i>
<i> that computer were awesome!</i>

05:16.016 --> 05:20.552
Dude! I just saw
the best movie ever!

05:20.554 --> 05:21.920
<i> Wargames.</i>

05:21.922 --> 05:23.255
All this time,
I thought computers

05:23.257 --> 05:25.724
Were for lazy-eyed losers
like you,

05:25.726 --> 05:27.626
But they're
actually badass.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.593
Thank you?

05:28.595 --> 05:29.528
Can you do
any of that stuff?

05:29.530 --> 05:32.364
I can make you
a really sweet banner.
I have print shop.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.499
Can you start a global
thermonuclear war
on this thing?

05:34.501 --> 05:37.836
Probably.
Don't do it!
There is no winner.

05:37.838 --> 05:38.537
What else?

05:38.539 --> 05:40.339
But what about
hacking the school?

05:40.341 --> 05:41.406
Can you
change my grades?

05:41.408 --> 05:45.677
Well, I would if
I was in the jtp.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.446
Uh, it'll take some
convincing 'cause the guys

05:47.448 --> 05:51.216
All think you suck,
but, I'll make it happen.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.751
Welcome
to the jenkintown posse.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.786
<i> While I was one step closer</i>
<i> to coolness,</i>

05:54.788 --> 05:59.591
<i> My mom was about</i>
<i> to take 50 steps back.</i>
Stop, stop.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.295
'sup, ladies?

06:03.297 --> 06:05.664
<i> ¶ when it feels like the world</i>
<i> is on your shoulders ¶</i>

06:05.666 --> 06:07.499
Why are you dressed
like a giant doily?

06:07.501 --> 06:11.036
Just expressing myself
like our gal madonna.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.705
Mom, that's el debarge.
He's a dude.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.240
And since when do you
like madonna, anyway?

06:15.242 --> 06:19.411
Oh, since I heard
her rockin' song about
staying a virgin.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.012
It's very cool to wait.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.347
Is that my
sixth-grade tutu?

06:22.349 --> 06:25.384
<i> ¶ feel the beat of the rhythm</i>

06:25.386 --> 06:26.852

<i> ¶ forget about the worries</i>

<i> ¶ you can leave them</i>
<i> all behind ¶</i>
mom? Okay.

06:32.025 --> 06:32.858
No, mom, stop.
(clicks)

06:32.860 --> 06:35.961
Well, I just want to
hang out with my girls,
right?

06:35.963 --> 06:37.195
Um, what do
you say we, uh,

06:37.197 --> 06:41.533
Read some teen magazines
and gossip about boys?

06:41.535 --> 06:42.534
I'll go first.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.403
I like murray.
You go, lainey.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.672
Uh, you smudged
your beauty mark
all over your upper lip.

06:47.674 --> 06:50.876
Okay, you need to go.
Come on.

06:51.477 --> 06:52.043
What?

06:52.045 --> 06:55.347
You let
louise rubin hang out.
Why not the bevernator?

06:55.349 --> 06:55.847
I'm fun, too!

06:55.849 --> 06:57.916
Of course you are,
just not hang-out fun.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.918
More like
a "I have a freckle
and I need you

06:59.920 --> 07:01.386
"to tell me if it's worth
being looked at

07:01.388 --> 07:02.554
"by a dermatologist,"
kind of fun.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.424
Every freckle is
worth being looked at
by a dermatologist.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.859
Why don't you schedule
an appointment
for next weekend?

07:07.861 --> 07:09.428
We can hang-out then,
okay?

07:09.430 --> 07:10.829
(sighs)
yeah.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.030
Adult adam:
<i> Madonna was a bust,</i>

07:12.032 --> 07:15.233
<i> So my mom went to plan b,</i>
<i> dermatology.</i>

07:15.235 --> 07:17.702
No, I can't wait six weeks
to see dr. Krogen!

07:17.704 --> 07:20.238
He's the last chance I have
to bond with my daughter.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.208
Please don't take this
away from me!
I'm begging you!

07:23.210 --> 07:26.611
Adult adam:
<i> This sad display made</i>
<i> the impossible happen,</i>

07:26.613 --> 07:27.379
<i> My dad got off his ass.</i>

07:27.381 --> 07:30.949
Good news,
you're gonna hang with
your mom tomorrow.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.584
(scoffs)
no freaking way.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.920
(chuckles)
oh, yes freaking way.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.788
Or else all the things
I don't care about,

07:36.790 --> 07:39.291
I'm gonna start having
strong opinions on,

07:39.293 --> 07:42.093
Like your allowance,
gone!

07:42.095 --> 07:42.994
No!

07:42.996 --> 07:44.830
Curfew? 6:00 p.M.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.398
What?
Skirt length?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.999
No skirts!
What?

07:48.001 --> 07:50.669
Just pants with pleats.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.570
Not the pleats.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.705
Oh-ho.
Pleats a plenty.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.574
Your mom
is upstairs hurting,

07:55.576 --> 07:58.310
And I can't bear
to watch it.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.645
So what's it gonna be?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.981
Adult adam:
<i> As my sister was facing</i>
<i> a night with my mom,</i>

08:02.983 --> 08:07.252
<i> I was facing the reality</i>
<i> of what hacking was</i>
<i> in the '80s...</i>

08:07.254 --> 08:08.620
(beeping)

08:08.622 --> 08:09.855
<i> ...Impossible.</i>

08:09.857 --> 08:11.556
(static crackling)
whoa!

08:11.558 --> 08:13.492
This phone is sick
or something.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.461
Hang up!
I'm trying to hack!

08:16.829 --> 08:17.562
This is a nightmare.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.431
I mean, I'm starting
to think a major
motion picture

08:19.433 --> 08:23.502
Has lied to me about
the capabilities of
home computers.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.270
Okay, relax.
How can I help?

08:25.272 --> 08:28.306
You can't!
I'll never be
in the jtp!

08:28.308 --> 08:30.976
Come on, adam.
You're a great kid.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.011
Those guys
will learn to love you

08:33.013 --> 08:34.713
If you just be yourself.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.548
Wait. Learning.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.283
That's it!
You're a genius!
Really?

08:38.285 --> 08:41.653
I just said some pat things
to make you feel better,
but I'll take it.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.755
(beeping)
<i> if barry and his friends</i>
<i> wanted me to hack,</i>

08:43.757 --> 08:48.860
<i> That was exactly</i>
<i> what I'd do,</i>
<i> hack their brains.</i>

08:49.362 --> 08:50.529
Access granted.
We're in.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.163
Yes!
Sweet!
Awesome!

08:52.165 --> 08:53.198
Okay, in order for me
to hack your grades,

08:53.200 --> 08:56.868
I'll need to go in
and input all the data
that'll be on your test.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.703
Wait, why would you
have to do that if...

08:58.705 --> 08:59.571
No time to argue!

08:59.573 --> 09:01.206
Jeff schwartz,
which significant

09:01.208 --> 09:03.875
Historical event
occurred in October, 1929?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.344
Um...
The stock market crashed.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.179
Naked rob, verify.

09:08.347 --> 09:09.014
He's right. He's right.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.316
Uh, it ended the
jazz age and began
the great depression.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.117
(keyboard clacking)

09:12.119 --> 09:14.753
Andy cogan,
what did president roosevelt

09:14.755 --> 09:16.187
Call his program
to jump-start the economy?

09:16.189 --> 09:18.723
The new deal,
enacted in 1933.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.693
Okay, open your books
to chapter 2.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.461
Go, go, go!

09:23.763 --> 09:25.463
Let's hack.

09:28.234 --> 09:32.237
No, naked rob's right.
It was plessy v. Ferguson.

09:32.972 --> 09:36.341
So awesome we didn't
have to learn this crap
for the test.

09:36.343 --> 09:36.942
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:36.944 --> 09:40.745
Adult adam:
<i> They weren't a smart crew,</i>
<i> but now they were my crew.</i>

09:40.747 --> 09:44.482
Wow. That is a cauldron
of cheese.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.651
I read about it
in <i> tiger beat.</i>

09:46.653 --> 09:50.221
They say
"fondue equals fun-due!"

09:50.223 --> 09:51.590
(chuckles)
do they?

09:51.592 --> 09:53.558
So, let's go wild,
huh?

09:53.560 --> 09:56.294
Uh, oh! (gagging)

09:57.463 --> 09:59.664
Hot, hot, hot! Hot!
(gasping)

09:59.932 --> 10:01.299
(snaps fingers)
excuse me?

10:01.301 --> 10:03.702
I'd like to report
some unsafe cheese.

10:03.704 --> 10:07.539
What if someone tried
to feed that to an
infant or a dog?

10:07.541 --> 10:10.609
Mom, look who it is!
What a coincidence!

10:10.611 --> 10:14.613
Erica, mrs. Goldberg,
what are you guys
doing here?

10:14.615 --> 10:15.447
Beverly: Just hangin',

10:15.449 --> 10:16.481
Not in like
a mother-daughter way,

10:16.483 --> 10:19.851
But more of like
in a girlfriends way.
Isn't that cool?

10:19.853 --> 10:21.219
Lainey: (chuckles)
totally.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.221
Speaking of cool,
we're gonna go volunteer

10:23.223 --> 10:25.724
At the soup kitchen
for extra credit.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.958
Wait a minute, erica.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.259
Don't you need
some extra credit?

10:28.261 --> 10:32.497
Thanks for looking out,
jill. You're such
a good friend.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.700
Wow. Extra credit.
(chuckles)

10:35.702 --> 10:37.602
You should
definitely do that.

10:37.604 --> 10:41.640
Say, what's the name
of this soup kitchen?

10:43.242 --> 10:44.709
Um...

10:45.211 --> 10:49.280
Helping hands, uh...
Feeding needy men's

10:49.282 --> 10:53.618
And a lady
who is also hungry.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.620
We should go.
Yeah.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.288
You tried to ditch me?

10:57.290 --> 10:58.790
My own daughter?
Yes!

10:58.792 --> 11:01.292
The only reason I'm here
is because dad forced me.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.560
Well, I'll tell you what,
buttercup,

11:02.562 --> 11:04.629
As of now,
I'm ditching you.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.930
What?
You can't ditch me.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.033
Oh, you've been ditched.
Uh, no.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.235
I'm the ditcher here,
not you.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.003
Well,
the ditch got switched.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.805
I will not be ditched.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.640
The ditch is done.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.480
Adult adam: <i> The moment</i>
<i> had finally come.</i>

11:22.482 --> 11:24.549
<i> The jtp had accepted me</i>
<i> into their fold.</i>

11:24.551 --> 11:27.218
<i> It was time to see</i>
<i> how the other half lived.</i>

11:27.220 --> 11:30.822
Aah! Brain freeze!
We're insane!

11:30.824 --> 11:32.390
(screams)

11:32.392 --> 11:33.091
(sighs)
yeah.

11:33.093 --> 11:37.162
<i> Turns out, the other half</i>
<i> lived like a bunch of idiots.</i>

11:37.164 --> 11:39.931
Ow! Dude, that hurt so bad.
That was awesome.

11:39.933 --> 11:40.832
(chuckles) yeah?
Yeah.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.001
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Uh, no, man!

11:43.003 --> 11:44.703
Your feet and hands
should be in sync.

11:44.705 --> 11:49.207
Go! Go!
Naked rob
doing what he do!

11:49.209 --> 11:50.075
Yeah!

11:50.077 --> 11:52.377
(indistinct conversation)

11:53.979 --> 11:56.948
Oh, my god.
(indistinct shouting)

11:57.516 --> 11:59.551
(indistinct conversations)

11:59.553 --> 12:01.820
Guys, I just found
a toaster in the
trash can.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.189
Sweet! Let me
throw it up in the air!

12:07.626 --> 12:08.126
All: Oh!

12:08.128 --> 12:10.462
Yes!
It's more broken now!

12:10.464 --> 12:11.763
Man: Madman schwartz
strikes again!

12:11.765 --> 12:15.100
Adult adam:
<i> The guys promised me girls</i>
<i> and stolen mascots,</i>

12:15.102 --> 12:18.470
<i> But all I got was</i>
<i> six percent dumber.</i>

12:18.771 --> 12:20.138
Hey, dad.
Bevy?

12:20.140 --> 12:23.908
I thought you'd be
elbow deep in some
hot cheese by now.

12:23.910 --> 12:28.680
Erica cannot even
cold chill with me
for a single night.

12:28.682 --> 12:33.485
Be honest with me,
am I the lamest person
on the planet?

12:33.487 --> 12:35.019
Uh...

12:35.021 --> 12:36.888
Let's get you a drink.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.423
Ray.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.793
Relax, bevy.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.529
You don't need to be cool.
That's what you got me for.

12:44.531 --> 12:49.200
But I want to be.
Teach me to be cool,
daddy?

12:49.202 --> 12:53.204
No can do.
You either got it,
or you don't.

12:53.206 --> 12:53.671
'sup, baby?

12:53.673 --> 12:57.242
But, hey, that doesn't
mean that you can't
have a good time.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.245
Well, I've been trying to
have a good time all day,

13:00.247 --> 13:02.847
Which is why
I ate all the cheese...

13:02.849 --> 13:04.916
Which is sitting
like a rock, by the way.

13:04.918 --> 13:08.520
Well, that's your problem,
honey, you try too hard.

13:08.522 --> 13:11.956
You want fun?
Well, buckle up,
old man.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.424
(chuckles)

13:13.426 --> 13:14.125
Ooh.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.529
Adult adam:
<i> Pops was right, it was time</i>
<i> for beverly goldberg</i>

13:17.531 --> 13:19.931
<i> To care less and drink more.</i>

13:19.933 --> 13:20.331
(sighs)

13:20.333 --> 13:22.801
(spits)
<i> ...Or just stick</i>
<i> to daiquiris.</i>

13:22.803 --> 13:24.869
That was fun.

13:25.604 --> 13:28.006
Dude!
You're our hero!

13:28.008 --> 13:29.207
What? Why?

13:29.209 --> 13:30.008
Because
the hacking worked!

13:30.010 --> 13:32.143
We just found out
we got b's on our
history test.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.778
It's awesome!
(all laughing)

13:33.780 --> 13:36.247
We got a bio test
on Monday.
Let's get hacking.

13:36.249 --> 13:40.151
I'd love to help,
but this game doesn't
have a saving function.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.554
If I quit now,
I'd lose my place.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.255
Then lose
your stupid place.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.990
(beeping)

13:46.358 --> 13:47.158
Oh, my god!

13:47.160 --> 13:48.893
How clueless
can you guys be?

13:48.895 --> 13:51.429
Shut up and hack
for your posse!

13:51.431 --> 13:52.730
Hacking isn't real.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.132
What? Then how
did we get b's?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.935
'cause I actually tricked
you boneheads into studying.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.305
Whoa. You taught us?
That's so messed up, dude.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.640
Yeah, we trusted you
and you lied to us

14:02.642 --> 14:04.409
Like senator mccarthy
lied to congress

14:04.411 --> 14:06.811
About the threat
of communism in 1953?

14:06.813 --> 14:08.179
And, oh, my god,
why do I know this?

14:08.181 --> 14:10.982
We were right
about you, man.
You're just a nerd.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.818
I'm a nerd?
Well, what about you putzes?

14:13.820 --> 14:17.455
All you guys do
is hang around
in a parking lot

14:17.457 --> 14:18.723
Hiding from girls.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.959
I mean, the craziest thing
that happened

14:20.961 --> 14:22.894
Was jeff schwartz
ate a hoagie!

14:22.896 --> 14:26.664
In 20 seconds!
Like a madman!

14:26.666 --> 14:29.968
He ate dinner, barry.
He ate dinner!

14:29.970 --> 14:31.135
You take that back!

14:31.137 --> 14:35.106
That's it.
We're kicking you both
out of the jtp forever.

14:35.108 --> 14:35.840
What? Why me?

14:35.842 --> 14:37.141
Uh, because
he's your brother

14:37.143 --> 14:38.409
And he just
shined a light on us

14:38.411 --> 14:39.777
That makes us
question everything!

14:39.779 --> 14:42.113
You can't kick me out.
I'm the founding member.

14:42.115 --> 14:45.383
Yeah, and now you're banned,
like how the volstead act

14:45.385 --> 14:47.886
Banned alcohol
from the country in 1919.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.054
It's 1920, bro.
Good catch, bro.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.823
Jtp out.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.093
Thanks a lot!

14:55.261 --> 14:57.295
Adult adam: <i> While barry</i>
<i> went to bed angry at me,</i>

14:57.297 --> 14:59.264
<i> My sister was wide awake</i>
<i> and about to learn</i>

14:59.266 --> 15:02.867
<i> What it felt like</i>
<i> to be a worried,</i>
<i> uncool mother.</i>

15:02.869 --> 15:04.502
Where have you been?

15:04.504 --> 15:05.503
I've been worried sick
about you!

15:05.505 --> 15:07.372
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

15:07.374 --> 15:10.008
Yes.
It's time to boogie.

15:10.010 --> 15:14.379
Okay, honey,
you've done enough
bogeying for one night.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.581
Oh, my god.
She's drunk.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.316
You are
such a bad influence.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.752
Come on.
Be cool about this.
(chuckles)

15:20.754 --> 15:22.587
It is not my job
to be cool.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.889
You are not hanging out
with her again. Understood?

15:24.891 --> 15:27.859
Wait, this is important.
This is important.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.060
What?

15:29.062 --> 15:31.763
(hip itched voice)
I love you, too,
mommy.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.798
Okay, you can handle it
from here.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.499
I got a meter running.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.734
Woof.
Okay, she is
a train wreck.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.136
Please do not leave me
alone with her.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.004
Your mother's taken care
of you your whole life.

15:40.006 --> 15:43.675
The least you can do
is take care of her
for one night.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.544
Beverly: Yeah!
And you know what else?

15:46.546 --> 15:48.613
Whoo-whoo.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.518
(snoring)

15:55.688 --> 15:58.056
Mom, I want waffles.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.625
Mom, waffles.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.359
Mom, waffles.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.762
Mom, waffles,
mom, waffles,
mom, waffles.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.564
(softly) hey, get away!

16:06.566 --> 16:07.598
I just got her down.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.935
Adam: I got you covered
in here, big guy!

16:11.804 --> 16:12.937
Eric: "I am sor?"

16:12.939 --> 16:14.539
It's supposed to
say "sorry."

16:14.541 --> 16:19.410
I ran out of ink,
and even this took me
an hour to print.

16:19.678 --> 16:20.345
I made waffles.

16:20.347 --> 16:24.182
Your apology's not accepted!
You made me lose my crew!

16:24.184 --> 16:26.384
Okay, so maybe
we weren't the coolest,

16:26.386 --> 16:28.886
And madman jeff schwartz
isn't that crazy,

16:28.888 --> 16:32.123
And naked rob's
got real problems, but...

16:32.125 --> 16:33.358
(sighs)
I don't know.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.593
I've never had
close friends before.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.762
Then you just got
to make it up to them.
How?

16:37.764 --> 16:42.133
We do the one thing
the jtp never had
the guts to do...

16:42.135 --> 16:44.235
Steal
the germantown mascot.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.804

Class started

17:21.840 --> 17:22.974
(sighs)

17:22.976 --> 17:24.475
Here you go,
my good man.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.211
Hall pass.
<i> ¶ never surrender</i>

17:27.379 --> 17:29.280
<i> ¶ never say die</i>

17:29.282 --> 17:32.050
Get to class.

(falcon calls)

17:37.757 --> 17:40.391
Slow down!
You're making it nervous!

17:40.393 --> 17:41.626
This is awesome!

17:41.628 --> 17:44.262
Not awesome!
I thought you were
stealing a costume,

17:44.264 --> 17:46.230
Not a real
freaking falcon!

17:46.232 --> 17:48.966
(whimpers) oh, crap!
(laughs)

17:51.170 --> 17:53.871
Erica: Good morning,
sunshine.

17:53.873 --> 17:54.839
Feel as good
as you look?

17:54.841 --> 17:56.741
I am so sorry
about last night.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.043
I hope I didn't do anything
too embarrassing.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.779
Well, you cried and said
"I love you" a lot,

18:01.781 --> 18:04.048
So no different
from normal.

18:04.050 --> 18:04.849
What was I thinking?

18:04.851 --> 18:08.219
You were thinking that
I'm awful for trying
to ditch you.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.587
No.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.190
You're wonderful.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.625
You took care of your mom
all night long.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.261
Hey, that was just
for one night,

18:17.263 --> 18:18.996
And I wanted to die.

18:18.998 --> 18:23.201
Somehow,
you do it every day
for all of us,

18:23.203 --> 18:25.870
And that's
actually pretty cool.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.945
I love you so much.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.279
Are you still drunk?

18:35.281 --> 18:36.647
Just buzzed.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.316
But every "I love you"
is for real.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.918

18:45.492 --> 18:48.893
Dude, goldberg stole
the germantown high mascot.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.362
Couldn't have
done it alone, ari.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.598
This was the work
of the jtp.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.600
<i> ¶ oh, oh, yeah ¶</i>
yes!

18:55.602 --> 18:58.870
All: Jtp, jtp, jtp!

18:58.872 --> 19:01.339
Jtp, jtp, jtp!

19:01.341 --> 19:02.907
All: Jtp!

19:04.309 --> 19:08.312
Adult adam:
<i> Yep, with a little help</i>
<i> from me and apple ii plus,</i>

19:08.314 --> 19:09.714
<i> Barry was back in the jtp.</i>

19:09.716 --> 19:13.751
Why do they make him
wear this stupid
bird hat anyway?

19:13.753 --> 19:15.820
All: Jtp! Jtp!

Adult adam: <i> That's the thing</i>

19:27.267 --> 19:29.467
<i> They may not be</i>
<i> the coolest cats</i>
<i> on the planet,</i>

19:29.469 --> 19:32.370
<i> But they're always there</i>

19:32.372 --> 19:34.438
<i> When you need them most.</i>

19:36.074 --> 19:37.241
Hey, what you up to?

19:37.243 --> 19:38.643
Mom got a new toaster.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.444
Thought I'd maybe
call the jtp.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.914
And we'd have some fun.
Cool.

19:45.651 --> 19:49.420
Actually, you know
what would be even more fun?

19:49.422 --> 19:50.988
If just you and me
broke it together.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.057
Just us?
Are you serious?

19:53.059 --> 19:56.561
As serious as truman was
about the taft-hartley act.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.729

<i> Ah!</i> (laughs)

20:24.657 --> 20:26.057
(bell dings)

20:26.059 --> 20:28.659
<i> So we can look back</i>
<i> in a hundred years from now</i>

20:28.661 --> 20:31.128
<i> And say,</i>
<i> "hey, we had a great life."</i>

20:31.663 --> 20:34.465
Boys: <i> Jtp, jtp!</i>

20:35.167 --> 20:38.236
Man: (on tv) <i> you know,</i>
<i> I like little houses</i>
<i> and big trees...</i>

20:38.238 --> 20:41.739
Guess what.
I went back to the
photo kiosk at the mall.

20:41.741 --> 20:45.509
And I scored you all
some pretty sweet stuff.

20:45.911 --> 20:46.811
For murray,

20:46.813 --> 20:51.849
A tie so we can be
with you all day long
at work.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.784
I think you're missing
the point of work.

20:53.786 --> 20:57.421
For adam,
a pillow with my face

20:57.423 --> 20:59.690
So I can give you snuggies
all night long.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.626
Yes.
I'll sleep easy now.

21:01.628 --> 21:07.064
For barry, a big, tasty hat
for your big, tasty head.

21:07.066 --> 21:10.201
Nice!
Beverly: And finally,
erica.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.436
I know you're all cool
and would never wear

21:12.438 --> 21:13.771
Any of this stuff,

21:13.773 --> 21:16.974
So I just got you cash.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.877
Oh, my god,
I love you!

21:21.947 --> 21:23.214
What the hell is this?

21:23.216 --> 21:25.983
Bev bucks.
You trade them for kisses.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.151
No.
First one's free.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.219
Take it back.
First one's free!

21:28.221 --> 21:30.721
I don't want it.
I don't...
Kissy, kissy, kissy!
