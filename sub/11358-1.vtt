¶ I got some money
in my pocket

00:34.405 --> 00:36.896
¶ I got the car keys in my hand

00:37.074 --> 00:39.406
¶ I got myself a couple
of tickets... ¶

00:46.792 --> 00:48.202
Hey

00:48.377 --> 00:50.333
¶ Come on, babe,
you know there ain't no time

00:50.504 --> 00:52.756
¶ To mess around round, round

00:52.923 --> 00:55.585
¶ Evie, Evie

01:01.557 --> 01:03.798
¶ Evie, let your hair hang down

¶ Evie, Evie

01:06.896 --> 01:09.387
¶ Evie, let your hair hang down

01:09.565 --> 01:12.432
¶ Evie, Evie

01:13.986 --> 01:15.942
¶ Let your hair hang... ¶

01:45.476 --> 01:47.216
Bring him in.
Bring him in.

01:47.395 --> 01:49.636
Through here. Just get him in.

01:49.814 --> 01:51.395
Alright, uh...

01:55.027 --> 01:56.767
OK, sit down.
OK, OK

01:56.946 --> 01:59.813
Hold his head! You have
to keep his bloody head still!

01:59.990 --> 02:01.446
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, you!

02:01.617 --> 02:03.949
We've gotta get a clean

02:10.334 --> 02:13.872
Uh, no .. Yeah, no worries

02:16.674 --> 02:18.130
What is his beef, huh?

02:18.300 --> 02:22.669
Doesn't matter
I can't do it anwyay.

02:22.847 --> 02:25.463
I can't shoot a mate.

02:34.150 --> 02:35.515
What can I get you, mate?

02:35.693 --> 02:39.026
Uh just a beer thanks.

02:41.991 --> 02:43.947
So, what's wrong with the dog?

02:44.118 --> 02:47.030
Oh, baited strychnine.

02:48.622 --> 02:51.659
Why would anyone
'want to poison a dog?

02:51.834 --> 02:55.292
Maybe someone set it out
for the roos or the dingoes

02:55.463 --> 02:57.328
or someone just doesn't
like dogs, you know?

02:57.506 --> 03:01.670
There are people, sick people.

03:01.844 --> 03:03.209
Sorry.

03:03.387 --> 03:04.888
Are you his master?

03:05.055 --> 03:09.424
No, no. He has no master.
Well, not now.

03:09.602 --> 03:11.433
That s not just any dog
In there, you know?

03:11.604 --> 03:13.435
No?
Oh no, no

03:13.606 --> 03:15.562
No, no, he's a famous dog.

03:15.733 --> 03:18.099
He's probably the most
famous dog in all Australia.

03:20.196 --> 03:22.152
Red Dog.

03:22.323 --> 03:24.609
Yeah, the one that warned
those people about that fire.

03:24.783 --> 03:25.989
No no, no.

03:27.036 --> 03:28.526
The one that saved that child.

03:28.704 --> 03:31.946
No, no, not him. Wrong dog.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.830
Didn't he...
No, no, no, no.

03:34.001 --> 03:36.287
Look, mate, you're looking
at it all the wrong way

03:36.462 --> 03:39.920
It s, uh.
It's not what he did.

03:40.090 --> 03:41.751
lt's who he was.

03:41.926 --> 03:43.507
Is, I mean.

03:43.677 --> 03:45.053
Red Dog?

03:45.221 --> 03:46.882
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.

03:47.056 --> 03:49.217
Vet's coming.

03:49.391 --> 03:51.052
Yeah? When?
Soon.

03:51.227 --> 03:53.764
How's the poor thing doing?

04:04.823 --> 04:07.951
Oh, l'm sorry, mate
Jack Collins, publican.

04:08.118 --> 04:09.779
Thomas Baker, trucker.

04:09.954 --> 04:12.036
Yeah, yeah.

04:12.206 --> 04:15.619
It was me that brought Red Dog
to Dampier, me and Maureen,

04:15.793 --> 04:18.079
near on 10 years ago now,

04:18.254 --> 04:19.790
back in the mean old days

04:19.964 --> 04:25.880
when men were men
and dogs were... dogs,

04:26.053 --> 04:28.965
rougher, hotter,

04:29.139 --> 04:32.051
brighter, redder.

04:35.354 --> 04:39.017
Why would anybody
build a town out here?

04:39.191 --> 04:42.274
Why would anyone live
in a town built out here?

04:42.444 --> 04:44.981
I know. Money.

04:45.155 --> 04:47.282
Yeah, I know that.

04:51.704 --> 04:53.786
What's that?
What's what?

04:53.956 --> 04:56.322
On the road.

05:06.427 --> 05:08.213
It's a dog.

05:08.387 --> 05:11.299
I can see that.

05:11.473 --> 05:13.088
What's it doing out here?

05:24.361 --> 05:26.738
Hello, boy!

05:26.905 --> 05:29.396
Hey? Hello.

05:29.575 --> 05:34.069
Hello. Aren't you
a pretty boy, hey?

05:34.246 --> 05:35.986
Hello.

05:36.165 --> 05:38.531
Are you lost?

05:38.709 --> 05:41.166
Do you need water?

05:49.511 --> 05:51.502
Cheeky bastard.

05:58.437 --> 06:00.393
Struth!

06:00.564 --> 06:02.304
Is that the dog?

06:02.483 --> 06:05.190
Well, it's certainly
not me! Eugh!

06:05.361 --> 06:08.398
Ohh! Oh, Lord
what did that thing eat?

06:08.572 --> 06:12.030
Stop the car
I can't breathe! Ohh

06:15.371 --> 06:18.078
Eugh!

06:19.124 --> 06:21.706
Oh...

06:21.877 --> 06:24.209
Oh this is like... Wow.

06:31.428 --> 06:32.463
Ohh!

07:34.825 --> 07:36.690
Ohh!

07:36.869 --> 07:39.281
Hey, Maureen, Maureen.
Come and have a ook at this.

07:43.292 --> 07:44.657
Oh, that poor little bugger.

07:47.087 --> 07:49.294
Oh!

08:01.560 --> 08:03.516
Oh, g'day, Rick.
He's out the back, mate.

08:03.687 --> 08:06.053
Thanks.
Hey, Rick.

08:07.274 --> 08:09.560
That's the vet.

08:16.825 --> 08:18.361
Here you go, Vanno.

08:19.411 --> 08:21.527
Hey.
Vanno, this is Tommy boy.

08:21.705 --> 08:23.787
I've just been telling him
about Red Dog.

08:23.957 --> 08:26.994
Vanno here's one of his first
mates from back in the days.

08:27.169 --> 08:28.830
Yes, 'the days'.

08:29.004 --> 08:30.505
Wild days?

08:30.672 --> 08:35.086
Very wild, very lonely.

08:36.761 --> 08:40.596
A dog of a certain type
can do well in a lonely town.

08:40.765 --> 08:42.222
I know.

08:42.392 --> 08:46.931
I come from a small little
Village in Italy - Abruzzi.

08:47.105 --> 08:48.891
Here we go.

08:49.066 --> 08:50.351
Ohh!

08:50.526 --> 08:53.484
Yes, yes, you all bloat,

08:53.654 --> 08:56.145
but my little Village
was beautiful.

08:56.323 --> 09:00.657
In spring, flowers
are like Turkish carpet

09:00.828 --> 09:04.161
and the wine would
make you see the Virgin.

09:04.331 --> 09:06.913
Why did you leave?

09:07.960 --> 09:11.248
Same as all these
fools, money!

09:11.421 --> 09:13.127
We all follow the money.

09:13.298 --> 09:14.674
They come from everywhere.

09:14.842 --> 09:16.378
From all the countries,
they come

09:16.552 --> 09:18.338
for the money,
for the work.

09:18.512 --> 09:21.629
From Poland, New Zealand,

09:21.807 --> 09:23.172
Ireland, Greece,

09:23.350 --> 09:25.557
Latvia, America.

09:25.727 --> 09:27.263
Even Melbourne.

09:27.437 --> 09:30.099
Living together,
eating together

09:30.274 --> 09:32.356
and crapping together.

09:32.526 --> 09:34.938
Money crackpot.

09:35.112 --> 09:38.445
They may look normal,
but not normal.

09:38.615 --> 09:42.153
Sun has burned out
their brains.

09:42.327 --> 09:45.535
See, I know sun
in Italy, in Abruzzi,

09:45.706 --> 09:48.823
but I not know the sun
until I come here.

09:49.001 --> 09:51.162
Very dangerous, this sun.

09:52.212 --> 09:55.249
I knew a man, Goran.
Remember Goran?

10:00.637 --> 10:02.969
The sun, it kill him.

10:05.976 --> 10:09.184
And also Sam.
Remember Sam-Man?

10:09.354 --> 10:12.972
He work in the sun
for five hours without no hat.

10:13.150 --> 10:14.515
Fool!

10:14.693 --> 10:17.184
Afterward he spoke
Chinese for two days.

10:22.534 --> 10:25.742
Before the sun, he know
not a word of Chinese!

10:28.540 --> 10:32.749
Yes, it was crazy place when
Red Dog arrive in Dampier.

10:41.178 --> 10:43.043
Men are no better
than wild animals.

10:44.097 --> 10:47.260
They drink much and they...
How do you say? 'Imbulge'.

10:47.434 --> 10:49.766
And their hair, it goes funny.

10:49.937 --> 10:51.427
¶ All day, all night

10:51.605 --> 10:54.017
¶ You know,
I've been working hard

10:54.191 --> 10:56.432
¶ All day, all night

11:04.326 --> 11:05.907
¶ Gather around, y'all
It's about time you learnt

11:06.078 --> 11:07.909
¶ About the new dance craze
that's sweeping the world... ¶

11:08.080 --> 11:10.571
If that thing could flap...

11:10.749 --> 11:12.364
...it might just fly away.

11:21.009 --> 11:26.424
You two... be needing
an ed-u-cation.

11:26.598 --> 11:27.633
A what?

11:27.808 --> 11:30.140
Arggh!

11:30.310 --> 11:32.096
Ohh!

11:37.859 --> 11:39.770
Though not all imbulge.

11:39.945 --> 11:43.187
Some were quiet, educated,

11:43.365 --> 11:45.071
with dark, mysterious past.

11:48.912 --> 11:51.574
Some that never, ever laugh.

11:52.624 --> 11:56.082
In Abruzzi, no-one would
fight over moustache.

11:57.129 --> 11:58.960
What do they fight over?

12:00.465 --> 12:03.081
Women!

12:05.762 --> 12:09.505
Abruzzi has the most
beautiful women in Italy.

12:09.683 --> 12:14.097
Slender, with a wonderful
breast, like a nut.

12:15.939 --> 12:17.304
Nuts?

12:17.482 --> 12:22.567
Yes! Big, beautiful nut!

12:22.738 --> 12:25.946
To come from a place
with such beautiful women

12:26.116 --> 12:28.528
to a place with no women...

12:28.702 --> 12:31.614
I don't think you can
understand such pain.

12:34.499 --> 12:40.335
In Abruzzi,
the sky is very blue,

12:40.505 --> 12:42.211
like, uh...

12:42.382 --> 12:44.338
...like the sky of Abruzzi.

12:54.853 --> 12:57.094
ln Abruzzi, the sea...

12:57.272 --> 12:59.479
Arggh!

13:03.487 --> 13:05.023
Oi! Oi!

13:07.532 --> 13:09.443
Barry Wright to main office, please.

13:09.618 --> 13:11.154
Barry Wright.

13:14.581 --> 13:17.869
We took a vote,
and the shop steward agrees.

13:18.043 --> 13:19.908
If you don't stop
talking about 'Bruzki'...

13:20.087 --> 13:22.248
Abruzzi!

13:22.422 --> 13:25.505
The Ski Patrol have
permission to slit your throat.

13:28.303 --> 13:30.385
Sorry.

13:35.143 --> 13:37.259
Everyone's homesick.

13:39.272 --> 13:41.388
Not you?

13:43.944 --> 13:46.526
Need a home to be
homesick, mate.

14:31.908 --> 14:33.489
You alone too, Mr Doggie?

14:35.453 --> 14:37.910
But you are happy, no?

14:40.041 --> 14:42.623
You have a gift, Mr Doggie.

14:44.171 --> 14:45.877
I do not.

14:53.597 --> 14:55.303
Have you ever heard of Abruzzi?

14:57.434 --> 15:00.096
Abruzzi has the best
fishing in Italy...

15:00.270 --> 15:03.433
¶ Oh, baby, don't you know
that I love you so?

15:03.607 --> 15:06.144
¶ Bom, bom, bom, bom

15:06.318 --> 15:10.311
¶ Baby, don't you know
¶ Bom, bom, bom, bom

15:10.488 --> 15:12.900
¶ That I love you so?
¶ Bom, bom... ¶

15:13.074 --> 15:14.689
What can I say?

15:14.868 --> 15:17.359
He was an excellent listener

15:18.788 --> 15:20.824
He did not judge.

15:20.999 --> 15:23.991
A polite doggie,
a very loyal doggie.

15:24.169 --> 15:25.534
Or so I thought.

15:25.712 --> 15:27.577
¶ Bom, bom, bom, bom

15:27.756 --> 15:29.621
¶ Baby, can't you see... ¶

15:32.427 --> 15:35.009
¶ That you were meant for me?
¶ Bom, bom... ¶

15:41.228 --> 15:43.139
Betrayal!

15:43.313 --> 15:44.428
Hey!

15:50.695 --> 15:53.562
What are you doing?
Nothing,

15:53.740 --> 15:56.322
Are you talking to my dog?
Your dog?

15:56.493 --> 15:58.734
How is he your dog?
I talk to him first.

15:58.912 --> 16:00.277
That doesn't make him
your dog, mate.

16:00.455 --> 16:02.116
That just makes you weird.

16:02.290 --> 16:05.202
If I am weird
then you are more weird.

16:05.377 --> 16:07.959
Not likely.
I feed him steak!

16:08.129 --> 16:09.869
Well, what do you think
I'm feeding him? Broccoli?

16:10.048 --> 16:11.584
Dog robber

16:13.093 --> 16:16.301
Alright, then.
Why don't we let him decide?

16:16.471 --> 16:19.713
Good.
Let him decide!

16:19.891 --> 16:22.803
Whose doggie are you?

16:24.145 --> 16:26.727
Give us a kiss.

16:30.318 --> 16:32.058
Good boy! How you going?

16:32.237 --> 16:33.943
Oh, you're a good boy, Red Dog.

16:34.114 --> 16:37.197
You little Red Dog, aren't ya?
Aren't ya a good boy?

16:37.367 --> 16:41.781
He was like that,
a dog for everyone.

16:41.955 --> 16:43.866
Come here, boy!

16:44.040 --> 16:45.416
Come here, boy.

16:45.583 --> 16:46.959
Here, Red. Here.

16:47.127 --> 16:49.459
Good boy! Come here.

16:51.965 --> 16:56.584
Yes, for everyone,
but no-one in particular.

16:59.431 --> 17:02.389
All those in favour
of Red Dog joining the TWU

17:02.559 --> 17:06.097
under the job heading
con...consu...

17:06.271 --> 17:08.262
Consulari.
Whatever.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.521
All those in favour, say ''Aye.''

17:10.692 --> 17:12.647
Aye.

17:14.404 --> 17:16.861
Yes, a union doggie,

17:17.031 --> 17:18.771
a doggie for all.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.487
That is, until he met
his true master.

17:21.661 --> 17:23.946
Johnny!
Yeah, Johnny!

17:24.122 --> 17:25.782
Johnny boy!
Johnny Boy!

17:37.802 --> 17:39.383
¶ Now listen

17:40.597 --> 17:42.838
¶ Oh, we're stepping out

17:44.434 --> 17:47.176
¶ I'm gonna turn around

17:48.730 --> 17:52.188
¶ Gonna turn around once
and we'll do the Eagle Rock

17:53.443 --> 17:55.900
¶ Whoa, mamma

17:56.071 --> 17:58.653
¶ Oh, your rocking swell

17:59.699 --> 18:01.690
¶ Hmm, yeah, you do it so well

18:03.912 --> 18:08.030
¶ Well, we do it so well
when we do the Eagle Rock

18:08.208 --> 18:09.744
¶ Mamma, oh!

18:11.044 --> 18:14.081
¶ Yeah, you're rocking fine

18:14.255 --> 18:17.622
¶ Why don't you give me a sign?

18:18.676 --> 18:23.386
¶ Hmm, just give me a sign
and we'll do the Eagle Rock

18:23.556 --> 18:24.932
¶ Hey, hey, hey

18:25.100 --> 18:28.968
¶ Good old Eagle Rock's
here to stay

18:29.145 --> 18:32.763
¶ I'm just crazy
'bout the way we move

18:32.941 --> 18:37.025
¶ Doing the Eagle Rock... ¶

18:41.741 --> 18:43.151
Good morning.

18:48.748 --> 18:50.124
Bloody Americans.

19:17.569 --> 19:19.105
Hey!

19:41.259 --> 19:43.750
Did you see that?
Red Dog.

19:43.928 --> 19:46.544
He almost got run over.
Nah, he was hitchhiking, mate.

19:46.723 --> 19:48.588
That was hitchhiking?

19:48.766 --> 19:51.098
Once you pick him up,
he remembers

19:51.269 --> 19:55.182
and thinks it's his right
to demand a ride any time.

19:55.356 --> 19:57.267
Pushy bloke.
no doubt about it.

19:57.442 --> 19:59.478
What? He only does that
to people that he knows?

19:59.652 --> 20:02.064
Of course not.
Just the ones he likes.

20:06.326 --> 20:08.908
¶ You can climb a mountain

20:10.246 --> 20:12.328
¶ You can swim a sea

20:13.374 --> 20:16.116
¶ You can jump into the fire

20:16.294 --> 20:18.410
¶ But you'll never be free... ¶

20:19.964 --> 20:22.376
¶ You can shake me up

20:22.550 --> 20:25.257
¶ Or I can break you down

20:26.804 --> 20:29.967
¶ Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

20:30.141 --> 20:31.642
¶ Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh ... ¶

20:50.078 --> 20:52.410
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?!

20:52.580 --> 20:55.447
Go on, get off my bike.
Go on, go on. Get!

21:05.843 --> 21:08.801
The world is a funny place, no?

21:08.972 --> 21:12.760
Sometimes you pick your dog.

21:12.934 --> 21:15.175
Sometimes your dog picks you.

21:15.353 --> 21:16.889
¶ Our love is alive

21:18.982 --> 21:21.314
¶ And so we begin

21:22.944 --> 21:26.607
¶ Foolishly laying
our hearts on the table

21:26.781 --> 21:28.737
¶ Stumblin' in

21:29.909 --> 21:32.776
¶ Our love is a flame

21:34.247 --> 21:36.112
¶ Burning within... ¶

21:38.209 --> 21:39.949
No dogs on the bus.

21:41.462 --> 21:43.748
¶ Stumblin' in

21:45.008 --> 21:47.374
¶ Wherever you go

21:49.012 --> 21:51.219
¶ Whatever you do

21:52.265 --> 21:55.928
¶ You know these reckless
thoughts of mine

21:56.102 --> 21:58.309
¶ Are following you

22:00.023 --> 22:02.059
¶ I've fallen for you

22:03.526 --> 22:05.767
¶ Whatever you do

22:07.280 --> 22:10.818
¶ 'Cause, baby,
you've shown me so many things

22:10.992 --> 22:13.278
¶ That I never knew

22:14.746 --> 22:17.533
¶ Whatever it takes

22:17.707 --> 22:20.414
¶ Baby. I'll do it for you... ¶

22:22.170 --> 22:24.001
All the sad faces in the world
won't work,

22:24.172 --> 22:25.708
so you can just stop.

22:29.802 --> 22:33.636
¶ Foolishly laying
our hearts on the table

22:33.806 --> 22:35.467
¶ Stumblin' in

22:36.517 --> 22:39.224
¶ Our love is a flame

22:40.897 --> 22:43.183
¶ Burning within

22:45.151 --> 22:48.484
¶ Now and then
firelight will catch us

22:48.655 --> 22:50.520
¶ Stumblin' in... ¶

23:02.168 --> 23:03.829
Ready?
OK, five.

23:04.003 --> 23:06.836
In for five.

23:08.257 --> 23:11.169
Ready? Quiet!

23:14.639 --> 23:16.254
GO!

23:16.432 --> 23:19.424
Eat, eat, eat, eat,
eat, eat, eat!

23:33.449 --> 23:36.111
9.2 seconds! A new world record!

23:38.371 --> 23:40.157
No!
Oh-ho-ho!

23:42.041 --> 23:43.872
What's next? What's next?

23:47.505 --> 23:49.245
A chicken!

23:49.424 --> 23:51.380
Why wouldn't he eat a chicken?

23:53.094 --> 23:55.255
A live chicken!

24:11.195 --> 24:13.231
Enough!

24:15.533 --> 24:18.570
I won't let Red Dog eat a live
chicken for your sick amusement.

24:18.745 --> 24:22.237
What's it to you, huh?
It's not your dog.

24:22.415 --> 24:24.906
No chicken, mate.

24:27.295 --> 24:30.162
Says who?
I do,

24:30.339 --> 24:32.250
Ooh!

24:38.723 --> 24:41.180
Fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight!

24:46.189 --> 24:47.679
OK, OK!

24:47.857 --> 24:50.690
No chicken, no chicken.

24:54.781 --> 24:56.567
Red Dog, come!

25:09.504 --> 25:11.586
Huh?

25:28.523 --> 25:30.354
Come on, boy.
We ride together now.

25:42.036 --> 25:47.156
And from that day on
Red Dog had a master,

25:47.333 --> 25:50.825
the only master
he would ever have.

25:58.928 --> 26:01.010
Hey, but enough said
about that.

26:01.180 --> 26:03.557
Hey, quiet! Quiet! Shh!
Turn the jukebox off.

26:03.724 --> 26:08.013
Uh...to tell you the truth,
I should put him down.

26:08.187 --> 26:10.178
But he's a strong old dog

26:10.356 --> 26:12.438
and God knows
he deserves a last fight

26:12.608 --> 26:14.394
so l've given him some
anticonvulsants,

26:14.569 --> 26:16.355
he's resting easier.

26:16.529 --> 26:20.067
We wait. Hopefully, he'll
make it through the night.

26:35.172 --> 26:37.163
Come on, Red Dog

26:40.219 --> 26:42.175
Poor Red.

26:43.472 --> 26:45.849
What are we gonna
do with you, huh?

26:50.021 --> 26:53.138
A shame, that is.
Yeah.

26:54.609 --> 26:56.565
There's a lot
of history there, you know,

26:56.736 --> 26:59.944
with Nancy, John, Red Dog.

27:36.984 --> 27:38.019
Down!

27:39.737 --> 27:41.728
Bad dog!

27:45.534 --> 27:47.149
You'll never get him
out of there, Miss.

27:47.328 --> 27:49.239
No-one sit there
when Red sit there.

27:56.921 --> 27:59.207
Ohh!

27:59.382 --> 28:01.668
Well, aren't you
a charmer, huh?

28:03.803 --> 28:05.919
Stop that!

28:08.265 --> 28:09.880
Bad dog!

28:10.059 --> 28:11.890
Hang on, Miss. Hang on!

28:12.061 --> 28:13.426
Ever since he became
a union member

28:13.604 --> 28:15.014
he thinks he's got rights.

28:16.565 --> 28:19.978
I'm not moving, so you'll
just have to put up with me.

28:21.737 --> 28:24.945
Stop that! Now, be
a gentleman and move over!

28:25.992 --> 28:28.108
Now!
Ooh.

28:58.149 --> 28:59.639
Hello.

28:59.817 --> 29:01.478
Hello.

29:01.652 --> 29:04.029
You're sharing a seat
with my dog.

29:05.072 --> 29:06.448
Yes, I am.

29:08.117 --> 29:09.698
Wow!

29:24.884 --> 29:28.968
So, what will you be
doing at Hamersley, Nancy?

29:29.138 --> 29:30.503
A secretary.

29:31.891 --> 29:33.973
Quite a change from Perth.

29:34.143 --> 29:35.508
An adventure, to be sure.

29:35.686 --> 29:39.019
That's a good way
to look at it, an adventure.

29:42.151 --> 29:44.062
Is alright yet?
Don't wanna be too late.

29:44.236 --> 29:46.318
Give it another minute or two
to air out, boys.

29:46.489 --> 29:48.730
Wouldn't want anyone
to get sick from the fumes.

29:55.581 --> 29:58.789
So, Nancy, there's a new movie
playing at the open-air.

29:58.959 --> 30:00.620
Would you like
to come and see it?

30:00.795 --> 30:03.628
What's it about?

30:03.798 --> 30:06.164
Uh, I can't remember.

30:07.927 --> 30:10.885
Alright, then,

30:15.518 --> 30:17.759
Still 'rip'.
'Ripe'?

30:17.937 --> 30:22.226
Yes, the rip is very ripe.

30:27.571 --> 30:29.653
Oh, yeah?

30:32.701 --> 30:33.827
Hi, John.

30:33.994 --> 30:35.370
Uh, I need to borrow the wagon

30:35.538 --> 30:37.654
so I can take the new girl
to the movies.

30:37.832 --> 30:39.868
What makes you think
that she'd be interested

30:40.042 --> 30:42.078
in a skinny
little Yank like you

30:42.253 --> 30:44.790
when she's got us
proper blokes around?

30:44.964 --> 30:47.000
I bathe.

30:47.174 --> 30:49.039
Also, do you think
you could watch Red?

30:49.218 --> 30:52.961
I think he's a touch...
...J-E-A-L-O-U-S.

30:54.348 --> 30:55.713
J-E-what?

30:55.891 --> 30:58.803
Jealous.
Oh! Huh?

30:58.978 --> 31:01.594
Pfft! No troubles.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.148
We'll have
a right party, we will.

31:03.315 --> 31:06.102
Won't we, Red?
Thanks, Peet. See ya, Red.

31:06.277 --> 31:08.438
Get ready to get wild.

31:12.575 --> 31:15.032
¶ Jeepers, creepers

31:15.202 --> 31:17.113
¶ Where'd you get
those peepers?

31:17.288 --> 31:19.495
¶ Jeepers, creepers

31:19.665 --> 31:21.621
¶ Where'd you get those eyes? ¶

31:21.792 --> 31:23.202
This one's a beauty.

31:23.377 --> 31:25.834
lt's called
the fisherman's rib.

31:26.005 --> 31:27.916
Lovely, don't you think?

31:28.090 --> 31:30.206
You play your cards right

31:30.384 --> 31:33.376
and I can make you
a sweater with four legs.

31:34.430 --> 31:36.295
¶ Woe is me

31:36.473 --> 31:39.636
¶ Got to put my cheaters on
Jeepers, creepers... ¶

31:39.810 --> 31:41.186
Where do you think
you're going?

31:42.980 --> 31:45.471
Ohh...

31:56.619 --> 31:58.484
Yo!

32:00.748 --> 32:02.329
We're going to the pub.

32:02.499 --> 32:04.410
I can't.

32:04.585 --> 32:07.042
I'm watching Red Dog
for Johnny boy.

32:09.298 --> 32:10.959
What is in his mouth?

32:12.218 --> 32:15.005
Hey! Give me that.

32:18.474 --> 32:21.591
Bring back my bloody yarn!

32:21.769 --> 32:24.476
Red! Red!

32:50.881 --> 32:52.257
Hello, kitty.

32:52.424 --> 32:53.960
Whoa,

32:54.134 --> 32:57.217
Hey, hey. Go on, take off.

32:58.430 --> 33:01.672
Red Cat was
an horrendous animal, no?

33:01.850 --> 33:04.136
He was - how do you say? -

33:04.311 --> 33:07.769
a destroyer of many pooches.

33:12.778 --> 33:14.814
Hey, what are you
doing to my cat?

33:14.989 --> 33:17.355
Nothing. I...

33:17.533 --> 33:18.898
What's going on?

33:19.076 --> 33:21.943
Oh, this cat tried to attack me.
It must smell Red Dog on me.

33:22.121 --> 33:24.453
Visitors have to park
on the road. It's a rule.

33:24.623 --> 33:26.488
Sorry, Mr Cribbage.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.749
Rules are rules, Miss Grey.

33:28.919 --> 33:30.750
With all the riffraff
the company's hiring

33:30.921 --> 33:34.084
It's only rules that
separate us from the animals.

33:37.011 --> 33:38.547
Goodnight, Mr Cribbage.

33:41.390 --> 33:42.755
He's the caretaker of the park.

33:42.933 --> 33:44.673
I'm trying not to get
on his bad side.

33:44.852 --> 33:47.218
Does he have a good side?

33:48.480 --> 33:50.812
There you are.
Thank you.

33:54.903 --> 33:57.645
Turn your bloody
lights off, ya nongs!

34:06.707 --> 34:08.697
Shh!

34:15.049 --> 34:17.210
Oh, geez!

34:18.594 --> 34:20.960
Ohh!

34:21.138 --> 34:23.925
Oi! I can't see:

34:24.099 --> 34:25.554
What the hell is that?

34:25.726 --> 34:27.967
Hide. It's my dog.

34:44.745 --> 34:46.860
Ohh!

35:13.065 --> 35:19.186
You, dog, be needing
an ed-u-cation.

35:24.159 --> 35:26.992
Hey, can I show you something?

35:34.044 --> 35:35.659
Careful.

35:38.841 --> 35:42.379
So a few years back,
this old dude, Jumbo Smelt,

35:42.553 --> 35:43.918
'Was swimming right out there

35:44.096 --> 35:45.802
and he got attacked
by a great white.

35:45.973 --> 35:48.555
Bit him in the leg
and pulled him under.

35:48.725 --> 35:50.852
Did he die?
No, no.

35:51.019 --> 35:53.806
The shark spat him out,
didn't like the way he tasted.

35:53.981 --> 35:56.017
Not a surprise
if you knew Jumbo.

35:56.191 --> 36:00.025
It took 73 stitches to get
his leg sewed back together.

36:00.195 --> 36:01.605
That's awful.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.441
Hey, no-one swims
out there anymore.

36:03.615 --> 36:06.527
Most days you can still see the
shark swimming back and forth.

36:07.578 --> 36:10.365
He's been spotted so often
the boys have given him a name.

36:10.539 --> 36:14.248
Mmm?
Lord Nelson.

36:22.593 --> 36:24.458
I don't see anything.

36:25.512 --> 36:28.128
Maybe we should
go out a bit deeper.

36:35.189 --> 36:36.895
What's that?
What?!

36:37.065 --> 36:39.351
Nothing.
It's not funny!

36:42.571 --> 36:45.108
Maybe he's asleep.

36:47.993 --> 36:49.949
Sharks don't sleep.

36:50.120 --> 36:54.784
They have to keep moving,
just like you,

36:54.958 --> 36:58.621
Mr Never Lived More Than
Two Years in the Same Place.

36:58.795 --> 37:01.377
Are you calling me a shark?
Maybe.

37:01.548 --> 37:03.413
Nah, you got me wrong.

37:03.592 --> 37:05.423
Moving is part
of my romantic nature.

37:05.594 --> 37:07.130
Hmm.

37:08.180 --> 37:09.761
You're just scared.

37:09.932 --> 37:11.342
Scared? Of what?

37:12.392 --> 37:15.805
Of finding something worth
staying in one place for.

37:36.667 --> 37:38.407
¶ I left the keys in the car

37:38.585 --> 37:40.496
¶ I left the door ajar

37:40.671 --> 37:42.502
¶ I didn't want to be alone

37:42.673 --> 37:44.755
¶ These are the days
and the nights

37:44.925 --> 37:46.711
¶ At these sweet
humbling heights

37:46.885 --> 37:49.001
¶ And I know
it used to be home... ¶

37:50.806 --> 37:53.673
¶ Well, whisk me away
I'll be yours for a day

37:53.850 --> 37:55.556
¶ In heavenly fields
we can roam... ¶

37:57.104 --> 38:00.562
¶ Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

38:00.732 --> 38:03.815
¶ Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

38:03.986 --> 38:06.272
¶ What are you doing?
What are you doing?

38:06.446 --> 38:07.947
¶ What are ya doing to me?

38:08.115 --> 38:10.197
¶ What are you doing
to my head?

38:10.367 --> 38:14.360
¶ Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

38:14.538 --> 38:17.905
¶ Whoa, oh, oh
You're too clean white love

38:18.083 --> 38:19.493
¶ I give my heart
on the morning... ¶

38:19.668 --> 38:21.078
Really?

38:22.754 --> 38:25.621
¶ Everybody's
looking for a fix, hey

38:31.054 --> 38:32.590
¶ Sell me a sign

38:32.764 --> 38:34.595
¶ I'll cut the telephone line

38:34.766 --> 38:37.223
¶ Just to keep
expectations alive... ¶

38:37.394 --> 38:40.807
Hello, Red. Hello! Come on. Up.

38:40.981 --> 38:42.346
¶ The feeling is blind

38:42.524 --> 38:45.061
¶ Though I climbed up
You're looking divine

38:45.235 --> 38:47.191
¶ Sell me it straight... ¶

38:47.362 --> 38:49.569
Red Dog! Red!

38:49.740 --> 38:52.072
¶ Keep on breaking
the rules, ohh

38:52.242 --> 38:55.609
¶ Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

38:55.787 --> 38:59.029
¶ Whoa, oh, oh
You're too clean white love

38:59.207 --> 39:01.289
¶ What are you doing?
What are you doing?

39:01.460 --> 39:02.825
¶ What are ya doing to me?

39:03.003 --> 39:05.369
¶ What are you doing
to my head?

39:05.547 --> 39:09.256
¶ Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

39:09.426 --> 39:12.759
¶ Whoa, oh, oh,
you're too clean... ¶

39:15.515 --> 39:18.803
Yep, Red was a real
matchmaker, alright.

39:18.977 --> 39:22.515
Red Dog is reason
I met my most bella wife.

39:22.689 --> 39:26.398
Do you remember? It was
the day Red Dog was shot.

39:26.568 --> 39:28.684
Red Dog was shot?
Oh, yes,

39:28.862 --> 39:32.195
After his first
great fight with Red Cat.

39:32.366 --> 39:34.448
Why would anyone shoot him?
Because he won

39:34.618 --> 39:37.405
No, he did not win
his first fight with Red Cat,

39:37.579 --> 39:40.696
but Red Dog was not
a normal poochie.

39:40.874 --> 39:44.082
He was smart, very, very smart,

39:44.252 --> 39:45.913
and brave.

40:14.116 --> 40:16.653
Get out! Get! You diety,
filthy, whoring hound!

40:34.886 --> 40:36.342
Johnny boy!
Yeah?

40:36.513 --> 40:38.094
Phone.

40:42.352 --> 40:43.728
Hello.

40:43.895 --> 40:45.556
He's over here!

40:49.151 --> 40:51.392
Hey, buddy. Hey.

40:51.570 --> 40:53.526
Oh, what have they done to you?

40:56.241 --> 40:58.732
Ohh. What do you think?

40:58.910 --> 41:01.697
I can stop the bleeding, but
'we have to get him to a vet.

41:01.872 --> 41:03.237
That's four hours.

41:03.415 --> 41:05.371
Three and a half, mate,
the way I drive.

41:11.089 --> 41:13.705
Don't you dare die on me,
you damn dog.

41:13.884 --> 41:15.795
Don't you dare die.

41:15.969 --> 41:18.506
You're OK.

41:18.680 --> 41:20.636
So, who do you think did it?

41:20.807 --> 41:22.638
Evil Cribbages.

41:22.809 --> 41:26.176
They live on pig snouts
and they hate the doggies.

41:26.354 --> 41:28.640
What makes you think
he has a rifle?

41:28.815 --> 41:31.602
I know.
How do you know that?

41:31.777 --> 41:33.688
After Jumbo Smelt
was eaten in the leg

41:33.862 --> 41:35.398
all the men with gun...

41:38.158 --> 41:39.864
...went out to kill the sharky.

41:40.035 --> 41:42.822
I'm glad they didn't kill it.

41:42.996 --> 41:44.361
Why?

41:44.539 --> 41:46.404
You never know when
you might need a shark.

41:46.583 --> 41:51.077
What in God's red earth
would you need a shark for?

41:51.254 --> 41:53.791
Say you woke up
one fine morning

41:53.965 --> 41:55.921
and didn't find it so fine.

41:56.092 --> 41:59.334
Being eaten by a shark is
rather a memorabie way to go.

41:59.513 --> 42:04.007
You would not taik this way
if you laugh once in a while.

42:05.060 --> 42:06.425
I laugh.

42:06.603 --> 42:08.468
Never.
He's right, mate.

42:08.647 --> 42:10.854
I've never even
heard you chuckle.

42:11.024 --> 42:12.389
Maybe you haven't noticed,

42:12.567 --> 42:14.819
but Dampier's no three-ring
bloody circus, is it?

42:14.986 --> 42:17.898
In my home Village of Abruzzi

42:18.073 --> 42:21.281
there was always
laughter, always.

42:21.451 --> 42:23.032
I don't even think
there is an Abruzzi.

42:23.203 --> 42:25.410
You probably come from some
piss-ugly town in Albania

42:25.580 --> 42:27.116
and are trying to pass.

42:27.290 --> 42:29.326
Vannoski!

42:29.501 --> 42:31.787
That is not funny.

42:33.839 --> 42:36.626
Yuri Vannoski.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.165
Dimitri Vannoski.

42:40.637 --> 42:41.672
Knitter.

42:43.223 --> 42:45.179
What did you call me?
I called you a knitter!

42:45.350 --> 42:47.341
What kind of a man
knits a sweater?

42:51.523 --> 42:55.766
Shut up! Give Red Dog
some peace, for Godsakes!

42:57.821 --> 43:00.483
It's OK. It'll be OK.

43:06.830 --> 43:09.242
Well, he got lucky.

43:09.416 --> 43:11.452
The bullets missed the bone.

43:11.626 --> 43:13.366
I saved them for you.

43:14.421 --> 43:16.833
Well, look at that.

43:18.592 --> 43:21.550
How long will he need to stay?
Just a coup e of hours.

43:28.602 --> 43:30.809
It's my shout, boys.

43:43.325 --> 43:44.861
You alright?

43:48.079 --> 43:50.616
Red's gonna need
to come back in two weeks.

43:50.790 --> 43:52.530
That's a long bloody drive.
Yeah.

43:52.709 --> 43:54.700
I could try and take
the stitches out for you.

43:54.878 --> 43:56.994
No.

43:57.172 --> 43:59.128
l will take him.

43:59.299 --> 44:02.211
It would be an honour.

44:21.404 --> 44:23.781
Idiota, Idiota, Idiota!

44:27.661 --> 44:29.868
His nose, it is, uh, very dry.

44:30.038 --> 44:32.245
I cannot sleep.

44:37.379 --> 44:39.620
Yes, a worm.

44:39.798 --> 44:41.959
A big white worm.

44:51.768 --> 44:54.885
l am sorry they give you
enema last time.

44:55.063 --> 44:57.896
This time I promise
to ask her out.

44:59.859 --> 45:03.568
OK, OK, OK.

45:06.408 --> 45:10.526
I ask her out
and give you big meat, huh?

45:10.704 --> 45:13.195
No. After.

45:21.381 --> 45:23.167
I can't see any glass.

45:25.301 --> 45:29.635
I wonder, you know, sometime,

45:29.806 --> 45:34.345
I and you together maybe...

45:34.519 --> 45:36.635
Are you asking me out?

45:40.025 --> 45:41.731
I do.

45:41.901 --> 45:43.687
Arggh!

45:49.659 --> 45:51.650
Well?

45:53.288 --> 45:57.281
Yes, I, Vincenzio
Albeto Girolomo,

45:57.459 --> 46:00.872
ask you, bella Rosa, out.

46:02.005 --> 46:03.370
A round of drinks on me

46:03.548 --> 46:09.009
for my bella Rosa, my bello
child Giovanni and Red Dog.

46:14.893 --> 46:17.680
He saved my life once. True.

46:17.854 --> 46:19.390
Yeah? How did he do that?

46:20.899 --> 46:24.562
Everyone that ends up
in this part of the country

46:24.736 --> 46:26.146
has something
they're running away from.

46:26.321 --> 46:27.777
Hang on.

46:27.947 --> 46:31.815
Lack of money, broken heaet,

46:31.993 --> 46:37.113
violent acts, loss of hope.

46:37.290 --> 46:39.997
We all have a story
we left behind.

46:41.628 --> 46:46.213
10 years ago, my wife and girl
were killed in an auto accident

46:46.382 --> 46:47.997
when I was driving.

46:48.176 --> 46:50.713
Oh, Jesus, I... I'm sorry.

46:53.181 --> 46:57.299
What Vanno said was true.
I... I hadn't laughed in years.

46:58.728 --> 47:02.266
Then one fine morning I woke up

47:02.440 --> 47:05.056
and I didn't find it so fine.

47:08.613 --> 47:10.444
Oh, g'day, Jumbo.

47:12.617 --> 47:13.982
Couldn't stand a drink

47:14.160 --> 47:16.367
for me poor nerves and
me throbbing scar, could you?

47:16.538 --> 47:17.903
No worries, Jumbo.

47:18.081 --> 47:19.696
Throbbing something
horrible all night.

47:19.874 --> 47:21.489
And what do I hear this morning?

47:21.668 --> 47:25.286
Me old nemesis. Lord Nelson.
is back off Hansen's Cove,

47:25.463 --> 47:28.580
swimming back and forth,
carefree as a kiss.

47:28.758 --> 47:30.294
Huh.

47:32.053 --> 47:34.044
I feel like
Captain bloody Hook.

47:34.222 --> 47:37.680
Tick-tock, tick-tock

47:59.497 --> 48:02.239
Hey, mate, can you grab
us a cold one out of the esky?

48:02.417 --> 48:05.033
Oh, g'day, mate.

48:09.382 --> 48:10.417
Get it!

48:24.689 --> 48:27.726
Where are you,
you lazy-arse fish?

48:34.324 --> 48:38.237
Hey, get out of it, you mongrel!
That's my steak!

48:46.044 --> 48:47.750
Drop that steak!

49:26.960 --> 49:28.746
Jocko!
Get out!

49:30.129 --> 49:31.869
Shark!

49:33.758 --> 49:37.296
Faster!
Get in, Jocko!

49:38.596 --> 49:40.132
Ah!

49:42.600 --> 49:45.888
Do you want to die?
Get rid of the steak!

50:05.290 --> 50:07.155
Get in!

50:11.462 --> 50:13.202
You alright?

50:20.638 --> 50:23.971
Wasn't for Red Dog and
that prime hunk of red meat,

50:24.142 --> 50:26.554
you'd be looking
at fish bait.

50:44.078 --> 50:45.659
Hello?

50:56.716 --> 50:59.628
Oh. uh. Wait.
Wait a second. Uh...

51:08.644 --> 51:10.020
A gentleman.

51:10.188 --> 51:11.803
Four sisters.

51:11.981 --> 51:14.313
Ah. Well...

51:14.484 --> 51:15.894
Oh, yeah, sorry. Sorry.

51:16.069 --> 51:17.605
Yeah.

51:27.246 --> 51:28.907
So, whatever happened
to them?

51:29.082 --> 51:31.744
Who?
Nancy and John.

51:35.713 --> 51:38.295
Uno, dos, one, two,
tres, cuatro.

51:47.225 --> 51:48.590
Up, up, up, up.

51:48.768 --> 51:50.304
Yeah!

52:05.243 --> 52:07.905
Not that song!

52:08.079 --> 52:10.240
Hey.

52:11.374 --> 52:12.739
Excuse me, guys.

52:12.917 --> 52:15.124
Oh, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

52:15.294 --> 52:18.001
Speech!
Speech! Speech! Speech!

52:18.172 --> 52:22.131
Speech!
No. No, no, no, no, no.

52:22.301 --> 52:25.293
What do you think I'm standing
up here for, the weather?

52:25.471 --> 52:28.178
How's the weather?
Hot!

52:29.392 --> 52:32.680
Now, most of you blokes
have no idea

52:32.854 --> 52:34.594
what we're celebrating
here tonight.

52:34.772 --> 52:36.353
You heard there was
free beer and food

52:36.524 --> 52:38.765
and you came swarming out of
the night like locusts.

52:38.943 --> 52:42.151
He's not a bad bloke
for a seppo.

52:42.321 --> 52:44.061
But I'm here to tell you
there's something deeper

52:44.240 --> 52:45.821
going on here tonight.

52:45.992 --> 52:48.324
We're celebrating
a unique moment in my life.

52:48.494 --> 52:50.234
Sedentariness.
Did he say he was on drugs?

52:50.413 --> 52:52.324
Nah, I think he's joining
the priesthood.

52:53.958 --> 52:56.119
Now, I've been in Dampier
two years and one day.

52:56.294 --> 52:58.159
That is one day longer
than I've ever been

52:58.337 --> 53:00.248
In any single place
my whole life.

53:00.423 --> 53:03.165
Why, you ask? Why? Why?
Why?

53:03.342 --> 53:06.379
Why in this glorious
armpit of the North-West?

53:08.097 --> 53:09.553
One reason.

53:09.724 --> 53:12.761
One incredibly
beautiful reason.

53:14.562 --> 53:16.302
I am hopelessly in love
with Nancy Grey,

53:16.481 --> 53:19.063
and I am not afraid to tell
the world about it, or her.

53:25.698 --> 53:27.108
Uh... Huh.

53:27.283 --> 53:30.195
Nancy Jane Grey...

53:34.707 --> 53:36.243
...will you marry me?

53:37.335 --> 53:38.871
John Grant...

53:39.921 --> 53:41.286
...I will!

53:55.811 --> 53:57.972
Now, go home!

54:09.033 --> 54:11.445
Lovely party.
Mmm

54:14.622 --> 54:16.533
I think we should
go to my place.

54:17.625 --> 54:19.411
Or we could just go
into my bed.

54:19.585 --> 54:22.952
Which two of your mates
are passed out in.

54:27.552 --> 54:29.793
Red Dog, you stay.
You hear me?

54:31.430 --> 54:33.557
I'll be back in the morning.

55:13.639 --> 55:16.301
Go back to sleep,
beautiful.

55:18.603 --> 55:20.264
I'll see you tonight, OK?

55:57.391 --> 55:58.767
Hello?

55:58.934 --> 56:00.390
Oh, hello, Nancy.
It's Jocko.

56:00.561 --> 56:03.268
Hello, Jocko.
How's your head?

56:03.439 --> 56:04.804
What head?

56:04.982 --> 56:06.563
Some joker's replaced it
with a swollen pumpkin.

56:08.277 --> 56:10.654
Have you seen John?
Why?

56:10.821 --> 56:12.197
Well, he never
showed up for work.

56:12.365 --> 56:14.947
He left my place early
to go back to his house

56:16.494 --> 56:18.359
He probably went
back to sleep, is all.

56:18.537 --> 56:20.949
I'll... It's nearly lunch.

56:21.123 --> 56:22.738
I'll pop over
and take a peek.

56:22.917 --> 56:26.626
Call me when you find him.
Will do.

56:47.149 --> 56:48.605
See that?
What?

56:48.776 --> 56:50.562
Turn around.

56:56.992 --> 56:58.903
Slow down.

57:07.878 --> 57:09.459
Here!

57:13.467 --> 57:14.547
Oh!

57:15.970 --> 57:18.803
No. Oh!

57:43.330 --> 57:45.537
With all the sadness
and the...

57:45.708 --> 57:48.666
...arrangements for the funeral,

57:48.836 --> 57:50.701
everyone forgot about Red Dog.

57:50.880 --> 57:52.871
Wasn't till
three days had passed

57:53.048 --> 57:54.879
that anyone noticed that...

57:56.218 --> 57:58.254
...he was still waiting
outside John's house.

58:07.438 --> 58:09.895
Nancy made an effort
to claim him, but...

58:10.065 --> 58:12.056
...he was a one-master dog.

58:12.234 --> 58:13.770
So he waited.

58:13.944 --> 58:16.606
In the heat and the cold,
day and night.

58:16.781 --> 58:21.275
For three weeks, he sat
in front of John's house

58:21.452 --> 58:23.568
and barely moved,

58:23.746 --> 58:26.237
his eyes
always on the road.

58:30.461 --> 58:34.170
Then one day,
Red Dog made a decision.

58:35.674 --> 58:39.963
If John wasn't gonna come home.
then he, Red Dog,

58:40.137 --> 58:43.220
would go out in the world
and find John.

58:46.143 --> 58:48.680
Walked in the transport...

58:48.854 --> 58:52.517
and looked into the face...
of every man there.

58:54.109 --> 58:57.021
He was asking
a single question.

58:57.196 --> 58:59.437
''Have you seen John?''

59:06.580 --> 59:08.366
''Have you seen John?''

59:20.678 --> 59:22.634
''Have you seen John?''

59:28.644 --> 59:30.555
''Have you seen John?''

59:33.691 --> 59:36.808
He looked everywhere
at Hamersley. Every department.

59:36.986 --> 59:38.601
And when he couldn't
find him there,

59:38.779 --> 59:40.861
he went to the saltworks.

59:43.617 --> 59:45.198
And then the mall.

59:52.251 --> 59:54.207
And then the pub.

01:00:04.805 --> 01:00:06.511
And even the harbour.

01:00:21.447 --> 01:00:24.860
Most dogs would have
stopped there, in Dampier.

01:00:25.034 --> 01:00:27.025
But most dogs
weren't Red Dog.

01:00:27.202 --> 01:00:29.989
And this is how
he became famous.

01:00:30.164 --> 01:00:35.625
This is how he became
the Pilbara Wanderer,

01:00:35.794 --> 01:00:37.170
Dog of the North-West.

01:00:37.338 --> 01:00:38.669
You see, mate.

01:00:38.839 --> 01:00:41.000
...he went everywhere.

01:02:48.886 --> 01:02:50.467
He travelled for years.

01:02:50.637 --> 01:02:53.925
Town to town to town.

01:02:54.099 --> 01:02:57.933
He was spotted down in Perth
more than once

01:02:58.103 --> 01:03:00.185
and as far north as Darwin.

01:03:17.664 --> 01:03:19.575
And I have it
on good authority

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.036
that he even hitched a ride
on an ore ship

01:03:22.211 --> 01:03:25.203
from Poet Hedland
to Saganoseki, Japan.

01:03:44.108 --> 01:03:49.102
But in the end,
after all the looking

01:03:49.279 --> 01:03:51.691
and the travelling...

01:03:53.325 --> 01:03:54.940
...the grief...

01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:58.615
...I think he finally knew.

01:03:58.789 --> 01:04:00.450
lt was time.

01:04:00.624 --> 01:04:03.787
Time to come home.

01:05:15.782 --> 01:05:17.363
Red?

01:05:18.452 --> 01:05:19.532
Red?

01:05:19.703 --> 01:05:21.159
Red Dog! Red!

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:23.821
Red Dog! Hello!

01:05:23.999 --> 01:05:25.955
Red Dog. Red Dog!

01:05:26.126 --> 01:05:28.412
You came back!

01:05:34.927 --> 01:05:36.383
Did you hear?

01:05:36.553 --> 01:05:40.296
I got a promotion.
I'm an executive assistant now.

01:05:40.474 --> 01:05:42.089
Which is really
the same as a secretary

01:05:42.267 --> 01:05:44.132
except I get paid
a bit more.

01:05:44.311 --> 01:05:47.098
They've put me on the list for one
of the new houses at Karratha.

01:05:47.272 --> 01:05:49.183
Oh.

01:05:49.358 --> 01:05:52.566
And I finally let
that Kurt bloke take me out.

01:05:52.736 --> 01:05:54.146
I don't think so.

01:05:54.321 --> 01:05:56.778
Bad dental hygiene.

01:06:01.995 --> 01:06:03.986
Shh.

01:06:08.835 --> 01:06:10.746
Hello.

01:06:10.921 --> 01:06:12.582
Miss Grey.
Mmm.

01:06:12.756 --> 01:06:14.257
It's come to our attention

01:06:14.424 --> 01:06:16.676
that you're in serious
violation of park rules.

01:06:16.843 --> 01:06:19.585
And what would they be?
You know what.

01:06:19.763 --> 01:06:22.550
No dogs allowed!
It's a silly rule.

01:06:22.724 --> 01:06:25.261
We know you have a dog
in there. No point in denying.

01:06:25.435 --> 01:06:28.893
Red Dog is not your
average dog, Mr Cribbage.

01:06:29.064 --> 01:06:32.306
He has privileges.
Everybody knows that.

01:06:32.484 --> 01:06:34.725
I don't care if he's
the Queen's bloody corgi.

01:06:34.903 --> 01:06:37.815
If you don't get rid of him,
we get rid of you.

01:06:39.533 --> 01:06:41.319
Aha!

01:06:41.493 --> 01:06:43.199
Red, stop that.

01:06:45.414 --> 01:06:48.201
Your contract clearly states
that you cannot own a dog.

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:50.832
I don't own Red Dog.
Nobody does.

01:06:51.003 --> 01:06:53.164
Then he's a stray.
No. He's common.

01:06:53.338 --> 01:06:54.999
What the heck's common?

01:06:55.173 --> 01:06:57.710
He's accepted and cared for
by the town.

01:06:57.884 --> 01:06:59.920
The community.

01:07:00.095 --> 01:07:01.756
Now, there's a laugh.

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:04.922
That's no proper town.
And there's no such community.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.011
It's just a bunch
of dirty miners

01:07:07.185 --> 01:07:09.597
working, drinking and whoring.

01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:12.057
What happens in this park
is what I say.

01:07:12.232 --> 01:07:14.439
And I say that dog
is a dangerous stray,

01:07:14.609 --> 01:07:15.985
plain and simple.

01:07:16.153 --> 01:07:18.690
And the next time I see him,
I'll shoot him for sure.

01:07:18.864 --> 01:07:20.229
Listen to me,
you little bug.

01:07:20.407 --> 01:07:22.819
You as much as harm a hair
on that dog's head

01:07:22.993 --> 01:07:25.826
and you will have me
and the entire Pilbara to answer to!

01:07:25.996 --> 01:07:28.954
You've been warned, Miss Grey.
And so have you.

01:07:42.888 --> 01:07:44.378
Now, once more.

01:07:44.556 --> 01:07:47.172
¶ We can't be beaten

01:07:47.351 --> 01:07:49.342
¶ What'll we tell 'em, boys?

01:07:49.519 --> 01:07:51.635
¶ We can't be beaten

01:07:51.813 --> 01:07:55.305
¶ There comes a time
'when every man must fight

01:07:55.484 --> 01:07:59.227
¶ When he believes in
justice and right

01:07:59.404 --> 01:08:03.898
¶ He'll take so much
till he'll take no more

01:08:04.076 --> 01:08:07.819
¶ They'll hear us coming
when they hear the mighty roar

01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:12.330
¶ Shoulder to shoulder.
we're gonna stand

01:08:12.501 --> 01:08:16.743
¶ We're gonna fight
to the very last man... ¶

01:08:42.906 --> 01:08:44.112
Who was it?

01:08:45.367 --> 01:08:46.903
Everyone

01:08:53.082 --> 01:08:55.290
Stop that!

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.496
Who are all you people?

01:08:57.671 --> 01:09:01.129
Well, they would be
the community of Dampier.

01:09:01.299 --> 01:09:06.339
But since there is no proper
town and no such community,

01:09:06.513 --> 01:09:10.506
I guess they're just a bunch
of dirty, drunken miners.

01:09:10.684 --> 01:09:13.300
Yeah!
That's right. Dirty, drunken.

01:09:14.354 --> 01:09:16.219
I'll call the police, I will.

01:09:16.398 --> 01:09:18.514
There's no need, Mr Cribbage.
Back here.

01:09:19.693 --> 01:09:22.024
Get these people
out of my park!

01:09:22.194 --> 01:09:24.447
Now, Mr Cribbage,
you're just the caretaker.

01:09:24.613 --> 01:09:26.569
Hamersley owns the land.
So what?

01:09:26.741 --> 01:09:30.108
I take care of the land.
You got a problem with that?

01:09:35.584 --> 01:09:37.290
What do you all want with me?

01:09:37.461 --> 01:09:40.167
Oh, we just have
a small delegation

01:09:40.337 --> 01:09:42.249
that would like to have
a private word with you.

01:09:42.424 --> 01:09:43.788
That's all.

01:09:43.966 --> 01:09:47.084
Oh, whoops.
Seems to be my break time.

01:09:47.261 --> 01:09:49.674
Call me if you need me.

01:10:10.619 --> 01:10:12.359
We had a little chat.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.992
It was very civilised and all.
You were very persuasive.

01:10:16.166 --> 01:10:17.576
It was nothing, really.

01:10:17.751 --> 01:10:21.369
All the Cribbages needed
was a bit of ed-u-cation.

01:10:22.631 --> 01:10:24.792
Well, they were so educated

01:10:24.966 --> 01:10:28.129
that they ran away and
took their caravan with them.

01:10:30.805 --> 01:10:32.545
The only thing
they left behind...

01:10:32.724 --> 01:10:34.180
,.was their cat.

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.521
So as Red Dog
would never be accused

01:10:38.688 --> 01:10:40.189
of being a low-down
dirty stray again,

01:10:40.357 --> 01:10:43.975
we all had him registered
at the shire as common.

01:10:52.953 --> 01:10:54.489
Oh!

01:10:57.249 --> 01:10:58.739
But...

01:10:58.917 --> 01:11:01.829
...there was a reckoning
still to be decided.

01:11:02.003 --> 01:11:05.120
The Cribbages
'were gone, true,

01:11:05.298 --> 01:11:09.587
but let us not forget
that a dark, sinister force

01:11:09.761 --> 01:11:12.002
still ruled over
the caravan park.

01:11:22.232 --> 01:11:24.473
Good versus evil!

01:11:24.651 --> 01:11:27.859
Civilization versus chaos!

01:11:28.029 --> 01:11:31.772
Doggie do versus cat poo!

01:11:59.436 --> 01:12:03.395
Red Dog and Red Cat are going
at it! Place your bets, gents!

01:12:04.983 --> 01:12:06.143
They fight!

01:12:07.402 --> 01:12:09.233
They fight!

01:13:02.123 --> 01:13:03.499
What?

01:13:07.837 --> 01:13:09.577
Spectacular.

01:13:28.525 --> 01:13:32.859
Nobody knows how or why.

01:13:33.029 --> 01:13:35.190
Perhaps it was
a grudging respect.

01:13:35.365 --> 01:13:37.572
Certainly, they were
the scrappiest and the rangiest

01:13:37.742 --> 01:13:39.448
their two kinds
have ever cooked up.

01:13:42.414 --> 01:13:46.783
Perhaps they saw more than a bit
of themselves in each other.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.541
Who knows?

01:13:48.712 --> 01:13:50.998
But know this.

01:13:51.172 --> 01:13:53.083
Mates, they became.

01:13:57.095 --> 01:14:00.383
Red Cat and Red Dog
Red Cat and Red Dog.

01:14:19.868 --> 01:14:21.233
Shh, shh, shh.

01:14:21.411 --> 01:14:23.823
There's an iron statue outside

01:14:23.997 --> 01:14:26.534
brought up from Perth

01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:28.573
by this fine man, Thomas, here.

01:14:28.752 --> 01:14:32.495
It's of that old English
explorer William Dampier

01:14:32.672 --> 01:14:36.415
Paid for, as in all things,
by Hamersley Iron...

01:14:38.219 --> 01:14:40.255
.to stand at
the entrance of this town.

01:14:41.931 --> 01:14:46.140
Dampier sailed into the harbour
in 16-something-or-other,

01:14:46.311 --> 01:14:49.098
spent five minutes,
sailed out again.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.728
The only thing
he wrote about the place was,

01:14:53.902 --> 01:14:55.312
''Too many flies.''

01:14:55.487 --> 01:14:57.819
That's it!

01:14:57.989 --> 01:14:59.729
''Too many flies''!

01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:03.066
Well, I say,
to hell with that!

01:15:03.244 --> 01:15:05.906
Why should we have a statue

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.073
honouring a poncy Pommy
fly-hating aristocrat?

01:15:10.251 --> 01:15:13.243
Or, for that matter,
a fat bloody general,

01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:16.128
or, God help us,
a stinkin' politician?

01:15:16.299 --> 01:15:19.006
Yeah!

01:15:20.553 --> 01:15:23.716
We should have somebody
that understands this place.

01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:31.012
Somebody that lives and breathes
this vastness and desolation.

01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:35.353
Somebody that's got red dust
stuck up their nose

01:15:35.527 --> 01:15:37.483
and in their eyes
and their hair

01:15:37.654 --> 01:15:39.190
and up their arse!

01:15:41.741 --> 01:15:43.402
Somebody that's like
all of us.

01:15:44.577 --> 01:15:46.317
Men...

01:15:46.496 --> 01:15:47.986
...and women...

01:15:48.164 --> 01:15:51.201
who understand the
meaning of Independence

01:15:51.376 --> 01:15:55.164
and the importance
of a generous heart.

01:15:56.756 --> 01:16:01.546
Mates who are loyal
by nature, not design...

01:16:04.305 --> 01:16:08.890
...and who know the meaning
of love and loss.

01:16:09.978 --> 01:16:12.685
Somebody
that represents our home.

01:16:14.649 --> 01:16:18.141
Somebody that represents
the Pilbara in all of us.

01:16:20.446 --> 01:16:22.823
And I say that somebody...

01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:24.356
...dammit...

01:16:24.534 --> 01:16:26.024
...is a dog!

01:16:44.262 --> 01:16:45.968
Guess whose shout.

01:16:56.357 --> 01:16:57.972
¶ Way out west

01:16:58.151 --> 01:17:00.437
¶ Where the rain don't fall

01:17:00.612 --> 01:17:04.981
¶ Got a job with the company
digging for ore

01:17:05.158 --> 01:17:07.900
¶ Just to make some bread

01:17:08.077 --> 01:17:12.366
¶ Living and a-working
on the land

01:17:14.208 --> 01:17:18.326
¶ Quit my job
and I left my wife

01:17:18.504 --> 01:17:22.292
¶ I headed out west
for a brand-new life

01:17:22.467 --> 01:17:24.378
¶ Just to get away

01:17:24.552 --> 01:17:28.591
¶ Living and a working
on the land... ¶

01:17:28.765 --> 01:17:30.130
Yeah!

01:17:32.185 --> 01:17:35.473
¶ What a change it's been

01:17:35.647 --> 01:17:39.731
¶ From working
that nine-to-five

01:17:41.069 --> 01:17:44.106
¶ How strange it's been

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:49.240
¶ At last I get the feeling
that I'm really alive

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:52.994
¶ Way out west,
where the rain don't fall

01:17:53.164 --> 01:17:57.407
¶ Got a job with a company
drilling for oil

01:17:57.585 --> 01:17:59.871
¶ And I'm never gonna leave

01:18:00.046 --> 01:18:04.005
¶ Living and a working
on the land

01:18:04.175 --> 01:18:06.837
¶ La-la la-la-la la-la

01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:11.220
¶ La-la-la la-la la-la

01:18:11.391 --> 01:18:16.977
¶ La-la-la la-la la-la la

01:18:17.146 --> 01:18:22.482
