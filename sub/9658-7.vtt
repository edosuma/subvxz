I'll see you later.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.469
Mrs Blake?

01:01.470 --> 01:04.869
Cec. Have you seen Lucien?

01:04.870 --> 01:08.189
No, ma'am.
Do you want me to call him for you?

01:08.190 --> 01:11.710
No. No. Thank you. Good evening.

01:21.870 --> 01:23.110
Hello!

01:25.390 --> 01:27.190
Anyone still here?

01:28.870 --> 01:31.590
(Bell tolls)

01:37.230 --> 01:39.269
Hello?

01:39.270 --> 01:42.070
Who's up there?

Charlie.

03:09.270 --> 03:12.070
Found this in the deceased's pocket.

03:15.390 --> 03:20.230
'I can no longer live
with this secret.'

03:22.030 --> 03:24.069
Rod Drury.
Hm.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.789
You knew him, didn't you, Doc?

03:25.790 --> 03:27.950
Not personally, but...

03:29.790 --> 03:31.390
Dear, oh, dear.

03:38.310 --> 03:40.070
Oh, Rod.

03:45.470 --> 03:49.150
No-one's moved the body?
Well, not as far as we know.

03:50.510 --> 03:52.389
You're quite sure, Charlie?

03:52.390 --> 03:54.590
Yeah. Why?

03:59.350 --> 04:03.149
Any witnesses? Other firies perhaps?
No.

04:03.150 --> 04:06.149
They were all at a fire
in Brown Hill.

04:06.150 --> 04:09.229
He must've known they were on a call.

04:09.230 --> 04:11.869
That way there'd be no-one here
to stop him.

04:11.870 --> 04:13.670
Yes, perhaps.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.830
Oh, who's this?

04:26.830 --> 04:28.510
What the hell happened?

04:30.430 --> 04:33.149
Charlie?
It's Rod Drury.

04:33.150 --> 04:35.389
Looks like he jumped.

04:35.390 --> 04:39.389
Bloody hell!
It's alright, mate, come on.

04:39.390 --> 04:41.310
Come on.

04:45.830 --> 04:48.189
I'm the station officer,
Mick Lancaster.

04:48.190 --> 04:50.310
Oh, yes, of course. Dr Lucien Blake.

04:51.510 --> 04:55.229
I am sorry. Police surgeon.
This is Sergeant Charlie Davis.

04:55.230 --> 04:58.349
Mr Lancaster, would you like me to
take a look at those hands of yours?

04:58.350 --> 04:59.829
No. No, thanks, I'll be fine, Doc.

04:59.830 --> 05:01.550
Alright.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.429
Should we ring the bell?

05:04.430 --> 05:07.670
Yeah. Yeah, if you could, Theo.
Thanks.

05:09.310 --> 05:12.789
Charlie, that chap going off to ring
the bell, he looks familiar to me.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.349
Who is that?

05:14.350 --> 05:18.789
Theodore Rowe, a local tailor.
He made a suit for me last year.

05:18.790 --> 05:20.830
Right.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.869
Lads, if you would?

05:23.870 --> 05:27.109
Uh, before you take him away,
do you mind...

05:27.110 --> 05:30.950
Of course, by all means.
(Bell tolls)

05:57.790 --> 06:00.870
Black residue under the nails
on the left hand.

06:02.310 --> 06:05.509
Yes.
What is that all over the fingers?

06:05.510 --> 06:07.389
Ink perhaps.

06:07.390 --> 06:09.870
Maybe newsprint.
Mm.

06:13.110 --> 06:15.549
You know...

06:15.550 --> 06:19.829
...on the right hand
there are six little marks

06:19.830 --> 06:22.749
evenly spaced in sort of
a circular pattern,

06:22.750 --> 06:25.389
acquired recently by the looks of it.

06:25.390 --> 06:28.429
Something he fell against?
Yeah, possibly.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.389
Whatever it was,
it's punctured the skin.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.709
There's bruising there
of the left wrist.

06:33.710 --> 06:36.110
Triangular in shape.

06:38.350 --> 06:40.589
Fractured, eh?
Re-fractured.

06:40.590 --> 06:43.030
It was weak already.
He probably did it in the fall.

06:44.350 --> 06:46.189
His medical records. (Sighs)

06:46.190 --> 06:48.829
The wrist was broken
three months ago in an accident.

06:48.830 --> 06:49.830
Ah.

06:49.831 --> 06:55.790
He's got fractures in both ankles,
compression spinal fractures...

06:57.310 --> 06:59.390
...and a ring fracture
at the base of the skull.

07:01.790 --> 07:05.149
What exactly were you expecting
to find?

07:05.150 --> 07:07.150
Oh, Alice, it could be nothing,
but...

07:08.550 --> 07:10.829
...his feet were quite near
the building,

07:10.830 --> 07:14.389
his head toward the street,
of course.

07:14.390 --> 07:18.109
If he'd jumped, you'd expect
he would have landed

07:18.110 --> 07:20.069
further away from the building,

07:20.070 --> 07:23.949
and certainly wouldn't you expect
to find him face-down?

07:23.950 --> 07:25.629
Mm. That's interesting.
Mm.

07:25.630 --> 07:28.269
And tell me, what's that?

07:28.270 --> 07:33.190
Ah... symbol of the fire service,
given to him out of respect.

07:35.870 --> 07:38.069
Can I help you?

07:38.070 --> 07:40.189
Cec.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.309
Thank you for calling, sir.

07:42.310 --> 07:46.189
Uh, ma'am, please, no, don't.
Don't cover him.

07:46.190 --> 07:49.030
Rod's... he's my brother.

07:50.990 --> 07:52.590
I'm sorry.

07:53.830 --> 07:56.669
This is Kathleen, Rod's wife.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.150
Yes, of course.

08:01.670 --> 08:04.310
Oh, please, no!

08:06.830 --> 08:09.510
What's this here?

08:10.870 --> 08:14.429
Oh, yes. His hands.

08:14.430 --> 08:16.390
The black is...

08:17.430 --> 08:20.030
Well, at this point, we're not
entirely sure what it is.

08:21.030 --> 08:23.870
Rod gave me a bottle of whiskey
last night at the club.

08:26.350 --> 08:29.309
The box was filthy.

08:29.310 --> 08:33.390
We thought it might be from...
when he wrote the note.

08:38.150 --> 08:41.869
No.
Tell them he would never do that.

08:41.870 --> 08:43.669
She's right, sir.

08:43.669 --> 08:46.829
My little brother,
he wouldn't kill himself.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.270
I don't care what the note says.

08:52.190 --> 08:56.709
Thanks for doing this. We just need
another look, Dale.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.550
I wasn't able to see much last night.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.790
Please, allow me.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.389
Thank you.

09:10.390 --> 09:12.189
Did you want me to come up with you?

09:12.190 --> 09:14.270
Why don't we leave the police
to do their job?

09:15.390 --> 09:17.109
It's Dale, isn't it?

09:17.110 --> 09:20.109
Yes, sir. Dale Hardy.

09:20.110 --> 09:23.829
Yes, of course.
Your father was a patient of mine.

09:23.830 --> 09:27.149
This must all be
a dreadful shock for you.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.829
Yeah.

09:28.830 --> 09:32.109
Rod does all the deliveries
for Dad's bakery.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.870
Well, my bakery now since Dad passed.

09:35.990 --> 09:37.629
Rod's been helping me out.

09:37.630 --> 09:39.349
I see.

09:39.350 --> 09:43.110
And tell me, anyone else
been up the tower since last night?

09:44.550 --> 09:45.749
No.

09:45.750 --> 09:49.869
Bill... sorry, Sergeant Hobart,
locked it all up last night.

09:49.870 --> 09:52.590
Right. Thank you both.

10:02.070 --> 10:04.110
Alright, Charlie?
Yep.

10:07.670 --> 10:11.070
(Whistles) Hell of a view.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.750
I'll say.

10:14.750 --> 10:18.309
So, Charlie,
there's a call out to a fire.

10:18.310 --> 10:21.309
Someone rings the bell,
volunteers arrive,

10:21.310 --> 10:25.789
they climb aboard the truck and in
this case, head out to Brown Hill.

10:25.790 --> 10:26.790
Mm-hmm.

10:26.791 --> 10:28.990
Rod arrives late.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.989
Maybe.
Mm.

10:31.990 --> 10:34.629
Why does he come up here?

10:34.630 --> 10:38.069
Well... to end it all.

10:38.070 --> 10:43.149
Humour me, Charlie.
It would've been quite dark, yes?

10:43.150 --> 10:45.830
Doc! What are you doing?
It's alright, Charlie.

10:48.750 --> 10:53.390
Now, he would have been
standing here.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.349
No, that's not right.
Hang on a minute.

10:59.350 --> 11:00.870
Careful!

11:03.110 --> 11:05.429
There! There, Charlie.

11:05.430 --> 11:07.949
(Grunts and strains)

11:07.950 --> 11:12.749
He was definitely facing this way.
He was trying to hold on.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.549
He fell and caught himself
with one hand,

11:15.550 --> 11:17.989
but he wouldn't have been able
to hold on for very long.

11:17.990 --> 11:21.429
And I think someone was applying
pressure to his wrist,

11:21.430 --> 11:24.029
perhaps even striking it repeatedly.

11:24.030 --> 11:25.670
(Shrieks)

11:26.990 --> 11:29.549
Which would explain the bruising,
yes? Yes.

11:29.550 --> 11:33.389
Yes, that sounds right.
Doc. Just take it easy.

11:33.390 --> 11:37.269
Charlie, look here. See here!

11:37.270 --> 11:38.590
Yeah, I can see that.

11:39.670 --> 11:41.869
Based on what we can see here,

11:41.870 --> 11:45.069
these were not the actions of a man
trying to kill himself.

11:45.070 --> 11:47.229
No.
But yours definitely are, Doc.

11:47.230 --> 11:48.669
Charlie, I was... Oh!

11:48.670 --> 11:51.549
Doc!
(Grunts)

11:51.550 --> 11:52.709
I got you!

11:52.710 --> 11:54.510
(Strains)

11:56.310 --> 11:59.390
(Strains)
Got you.

12:06.870 --> 12:08.350
Thank you, Charlie.

12:14.190 --> 12:15.390
Charlie, look.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.309
There was definitely someone else
on that ledge with Rod.

12:20.310 --> 12:24.109
We found a second partial handprint
under the railing.

12:24.110 --> 12:27.229
Looks like the same stains
as Rod's prints.Yes.

12:27.230 --> 12:29.869
Right. Anything else from
the examination of the body?

12:29.870 --> 12:33.309
There was some kind of black residue
under Rod's fingernails.

12:33.310 --> 12:36.189
Dr Harvey should have
the forensic results back shortly.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.829
Well, this definitely wasn't suicide.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.629
Somebody planted that note.

12:39.630 --> 12:42.029
Bill's been filling me in
on Rod Drury.

12:42.030 --> 12:43.749
Quite a colourful character.

12:43.750 --> 12:46.029
Now, we have confirmed
this is Rod's writing,

12:46.030 --> 12:48.469
but take a look at this edge here.

12:48.470 --> 12:53.669
Yes. It's been cut. Very...
Very neatly, by the looks.

12:53.670 --> 12:56.829
Mm. So, someone went to
a fair bit of trouble here.

12:56.830 --> 12:58.989
Make sure all of this
is going into the report.

12:58.990 --> 13:00.749
Yes, sir.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.989
Bill, just hold on one moment,
would you?

13:02.990 --> 13:05.670
It's not finished...
I do apologise.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.989
Frank?

13:10.990 --> 13:14.549
I'd say that note was written
on carbon-backed paper.

13:14.550 --> 13:17.109
Do you think there might be a copy?

13:17.110 --> 13:18.509
Rod ran a delivery business.

13:18.510 --> 13:20.989
Let's check all his receipt books
and ledgers.

13:20.990 --> 13:23.269
Find out all his movements
in the last couple of days.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.549
What about me, boss?

13:24.550 --> 13:26.549
Me and the boys were going over
to Rod's place.

13:26.550 --> 13:28.269
I'll keep an eye out
for what's there.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.750
But I reckon most of the
delivery books are in his van.

13:32.470 --> 13:34.669
Oh, well done, Charlie.

13:34.670 --> 13:39.309
Ah, alcohol for the Colonists' Club.
Mm.

13:39.310 --> 13:42.669
And a bread delivery
for Dale's bakery,

13:42.670 --> 13:44.389
done yesterday by the looks of it.

13:44.390 --> 13:47.109
No receipt books.
I'll check up the front.

13:47.110 --> 13:49.469
And I'll check those boxes
up the back there.

13:49.470 --> 13:51.390
(Strains) Thank you, Charlie.

14:00.830 --> 14:03.589
Looks like someone else has been
searching for a copy of the letter

14:03.590 --> 14:04.590
as well.

14:14.630 --> 14:16.550
Ah! I think I've got something.

14:17.550 --> 14:19.470
Yes, me too.

14:21.190 --> 14:24.269
It's a list of debts.
Small amounts, mostly.

14:24.270 --> 14:26.789
But look here. 'N-K'

14:26.790 --> 14:30.349
Whoever N-K is, they owed Rod Â£200.

14:30.350 --> 14:31.629
Bloody hell.

14:31.630 --> 14:32.989
What have you found?

14:32.990 --> 14:35.229
That's a very good question, Charlie.

14:35.230 --> 14:42.069
I found these in that last box
up the far corner there.

14:42.070 --> 14:45.190
Why would Rod hide those things
in here?

14:46.190 --> 14:47.790
I don't know.

14:49.230 --> 14:51.669
But I do know
where we might find an answer.

14:51.670 --> 14:55.829
Oh, well, that's just it.
Another chip-pan fire.

14:55.830 --> 14:57.829
You don't hear a thing
until it's almost too late.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.429
It was lucky we got there in time.

14:59.430 --> 15:01.989
You couldn't see more than 2ft
in front of your own face...

15:01.990 --> 15:04.789
The house is still standing, though.
No-one got hurt.

15:04.790 --> 15:06.469
You can't do much more than that,
mate.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.950
Leave those. I said, leave it!

15:12.390 --> 15:16.109
(Sobs) They were from Rod.

15:16.110 --> 15:20.549
He gave them to me last week!
It's alright, love. It's alright.

15:20.550 --> 15:24.429
Kathleen, let's get you up.
Is everything alright, Kath?

15:24.430 --> 15:27.229
We're alright, Mr Lancaster.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.789
Sergeant Hobart told us the news,
sir.

15:29.790 --> 15:32.750
We knew it wasn't suicide.

15:33.870 --> 15:36.469
It's alright, Cec.

15:36.470 --> 15:38.709
If there's anything me or any of the
other firies

15:38.710 --> 15:40.629
can do to help, you just ask.

15:40.630 --> 15:43.469
Well, as a matter of fact,
Mr Lancaster, there is something.

15:43.470 --> 15:45.989
Charlie, are you there? Thank you.

15:45.990 --> 15:50.869
We, um... We found this in Rod's van.

15:50.870 --> 15:55.469
Now, as far as you know, is it his?

15:55.470 --> 15:57.989
Rod only ever wore a suede coat.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.589
He had a coat at the station
for call-outs, but that's not it.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.549
Right.

16:02.550 --> 16:04.869
Then I'm wondering,

16:04.870 --> 16:08.229
why would he effectively
keep it hidden in his van?

16:08.230 --> 16:10.589
Perhaps it didn't belong to him,
or...

16:10.590 --> 16:12.509
I'm not sure what you're getting at,
mate,

16:12.510 --> 16:14.389
but now's not the time or the place.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.990
We're all here to pay our respects.
Of course.

16:21.830 --> 16:25.869
Kathleen, please forgive me. I...

16:25.870 --> 16:28.629
It's alright. I extend that to you
too, of course, Mr Lancaster.

16:28.630 --> 16:31.229
No, I'm fine, Doc.
Just look after Kath.Yes.

16:31.230 --> 16:34.149
Davis, I've got those books for you
in the spare room.

16:34.150 --> 16:36.389
I'll go and just pop the kettle on.

16:36.390 --> 16:37.510
Very good, Cec.

16:41.390 --> 16:45.829
My Rod, he had a finger in a lot
of pies. But he wasn't a crook.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.390
He was a good man.

16:49.790 --> 16:51.470
He loved me.

16:52.870 --> 16:55.990
Still bringing me flowers
after all these years.

16:59.110 --> 17:00.510
Oh, come here.

17:02.990 --> 17:06.429
Doc. Rod's receipt books.

17:06.430 --> 17:08.989
Sergeant, listen,
it could be nothing,

17:08.990 --> 17:11.989
but you might want to check out
Neil Kirby's movements last night.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.628
The publican at the Red Hand.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.429
Neil Kirby.
N-K.

17:15.430 --> 17:18.429
Rod had a bit of a blue with Neil
a while back outside the RSL.

17:18.430 --> 17:21.029
Some army bloke had to break it up.

17:21.030 --> 17:23.469
Neil wouldn't let it go,
said he'd get Rod back.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.349
I don't know. Maybe he meant it.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.388
Found out he'd been ripping me off.

17:28.390 --> 17:32.389
Is that what your fight was about
at the RSL?

17:32.390 --> 17:34.349
When was the last time you saw Rod?

17:34.350 --> 17:38.109
Yesterday, about three.
He came in for a drink.

17:38.110 --> 17:39.749
I thought you'd had a falling out?

17:39.750 --> 17:42.389
He wanted to smooth things over.
I see.

17:42.390 --> 17:43.869
And where were you last night

17:43.870 --> 17:45.829
between the hours
of nine and ten o'clock?

17:45.830 --> 17:49.270
I was here, cleaning up. Why?

17:50.430 --> 17:53.589
Can anyone vouch for that?
No. I was here alone.

17:53.590 --> 17:58.189
Look, I'm sorry that Rod jumped,
but it had nothing to do with me.

17:58.190 --> 18:01.390
He didn't jump. He was pushed.

18:02.590 --> 18:05.670
You owed Rod Â£200.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.629
You didn't think to mention that?

18:08.630 --> 18:12.789
It's not what you think.
I can prove it.

18:12.790 --> 18:15.070
If you just let me go upstairs
and get my books.

18:18.310 --> 18:19.789
Charlie,
I might head to the hospital.

18:19.790 --> 18:23.269
Start running tests on those items
we found in Rod's van.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.789
Sure thing, Doc.
I can handle this.

18:25.790 --> 18:28.190
Mm. Good man.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.549
It could be the same residue
we found on the victim's hands

18:33.550 --> 18:35.309
and under his nails,

18:35.310 --> 18:38.269
but I won't know for sure
until I get the test results back.

18:38.270 --> 18:39.589
Quite.

18:39.590 --> 18:42.189
Alice, what do you make
of these fragments

18:42.190 --> 18:43.750
I found in his coat pockets?

18:45.110 --> 18:47.629
Hmm. It's not bone.

18:47.630 --> 18:49.549
Similar texture, though.
Mm.

18:49.550 --> 18:51.669
Maybe from a china cup?

18:51.670 --> 18:53.389
Well, maybe.

18:53.390 --> 18:57.669
And look, here on the, um...
on the lapel.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.389
Now, something was pinned there
at some point,

19:00.390 --> 19:02.509
a badge or a medal or something.

19:02.510 --> 19:04.709
You think all of this might
have something to do with

19:04.710 --> 19:06.989
why Mr Drury was murdered?

19:06.990 --> 19:12.029
Right now the only thing I am
certain of is that he had a secret.

19:12.030 --> 19:14.429
Wait! Where are you taking that?

19:14.430 --> 19:18.869
Um, a few more tests
I want to run myself.

19:18.870 --> 19:21.629
What, and you can't do them here?

19:21.630 --> 19:23.310
Best not.

19:40.270 --> 19:41.789
Heading off, Mr Kirby?

19:41.790 --> 19:43.309
I've got deliveries to make.

19:43.310 --> 19:45.644
I can't spend all day standing
around talking to you lot.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.830
Out of the car. Don't!

19:58.470 --> 20:00.830
Let's start with that Â£200.

20:03.230 --> 20:05.469
Must be a weight off your shoulders
now Rod's dead.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.349
What was it really, Mr Kirby?

20:08.350 --> 20:11.709
Rod lend you the money,
then held it over you,

20:11.710 --> 20:14.669
so you attack him outside the RSL.

20:14.670 --> 20:18.429
Sound right? Or maybe...

20:18.430 --> 20:20.189
Maybe it wasn't about the money.

20:20.190 --> 20:23.670
Maybe it was about Rod
revealing your secret.

20:24.750 --> 20:29.029
I don't have any bloody secrets.
Not in this town.

20:29.030 --> 20:31.789
Everyone knows I lost
half of everything in the divorce.

20:31.790 --> 20:34.389
Oh. Must have stung.

20:34.390 --> 20:37.070
Yes. Rod bailed me out.

20:38.550 --> 20:41.069
And then he goes to the RSL
behind my back,

20:41.070 --> 20:44.229
cuts me off supplying them their
booze until I paid him back.

20:44.230 --> 20:46.789
Doing all this for me,
making himself out to be

20:46.790 --> 20:48.869
some sort of big man,
while he's ripping me off.

20:48.870 --> 20:51.589
So, he deserved to die?

20:51.590 --> 20:55.469
Is that what you told yourself
when you lured him up to that tower?

20:55.470 --> 20:58.989
By the way, you've got some boot
polish on your collar, Mr Kirby.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.709
I noticed it at the pub.

21:00.710 --> 21:03.150
Been using it in your hair, have you?

21:04.190 --> 21:08.389
You know, we found a black substance
under Rod's fingernails?

21:08.390 --> 21:10.469
Did he grab at your hair

21:10.470 --> 21:12.950
while he was trying to save himself
up on that ledge?

21:14.430 --> 21:17.029
According to this, since the divorce,

21:17.030 --> 21:20.110
you've been staying at the pub
in the room upstairs.

21:21.110 --> 21:23.670
Well, that's one street away
from the fire station, isn't it?

21:31.390 --> 21:34.389
Get his prints.
Take him downstairs to the lockup.

21:34.390 --> 21:37.350
I'll let the boss know
what he has to say.OK.

21:38.710 --> 21:41.829
So, Neil Kirby's contracts
to supply alcohol to the club

21:41.830 --> 21:44.109
are now in Rod Drury's name?
Yes, sir.

21:44.110 --> 21:47.389
It was signed over to him two months
ago with some special conditions.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.790
Right. And do you mind
if I see those contracts?

21:50.790 --> 21:53.510
Might take me a while to find them,
sir. I can wait.

21:56.430 --> 21:59.629
Oh, just another thing -
apparently there was a fight here

21:59.630 --> 22:01.629
between the two men
a few months back.

22:01.630 --> 22:03.869
Was that over the contract?
I'm not sure, sir.

22:03.870 --> 22:06.789
I understand one of your members
broke up that fight.

22:06.790 --> 22:09.030
Is he here now, or...?

22:10.230 --> 22:11.669
Mr Carlyle.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.070
Major Alderton.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.309
Well, are you here for a drink,
Frank,

22:16.310 --> 22:18.109
or would you like a tip
on the horses?

22:18.110 --> 22:21.869
Thank you, no. I'm looking
into the murder of Rod Drury.

22:21.870 --> 22:23.429
Should I know him?

22:23.430 --> 22:25.829
Well, apparently, you broke up
a fight between he and Neil Kirby

22:25.830 --> 22:28.229
a few months back.
Kirby I do know.

22:28.230 --> 22:29.949
He served with me,
didn't he, Sergeant?

22:29.950 --> 22:33.189
Yes.
Terrible temper, but a good soldier.

22:33.190 --> 22:34.749
He gave the other bloke
quite a hiding

22:34.750 --> 22:36.309
then they shook hands at the end.

22:36.310 --> 22:37.989
Oh, they shook hands?
Oh, well,

22:37.990 --> 22:40.629
just a couple of blokes letting off
some steam, sir, nothing more.

22:40.630 --> 22:43.430
Here's your contract, sir.
And those special conditions.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.549
Well, thank you, Major. Sergeant.

22:46.550 --> 22:48.590
Chief Superintendent.

23:34.670 --> 23:37.350
(Explosion, glass shattering)

23:44.630 --> 23:46.269
Lucien, what on earth are you doing?!

23:46.270 --> 23:49.229
It smells like moth balls in here.
Cec is here to see you.

23:49.230 --> 23:51.430
I've made some tea.
Tea.

23:52.710 --> 23:54.470
Lovely, thank you, Jean.

23:59.190 --> 24:03.150
Lucien...
Cec hasn't been able to sleep.

24:04.150 --> 24:07.389
I was hoping you could give me
something to help, sir,

24:07.390 --> 24:08.709
if it's not too much trouble.

24:08.710 --> 24:10.109
Of course.

24:10.110 --> 24:12.190
Of course,
I'll write a prescription up for you.

24:14.190 --> 24:16.190
Now, Cec, forgive me...

24:17.630 --> 24:20.229
...I do need to ask...

24:20.230 --> 24:21.510
Thank you, Jean.

24:22.990 --> 24:27.149
Last night, Rod was at the
Colonists', making a delivery, yes?

24:27.150 --> 24:30.869
Yes, sir. Once a week. Same time.

24:30.870 --> 24:34.829
And then we'd have a drink
at the office out the back,

24:34.830 --> 24:36.750
just the two of us.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.390
It was our time.

24:41.030 --> 24:42.229
Yes.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.669
But last night,
he was called to the fire station.

24:44.670 --> 24:48.109
Well, no, not exactly, sir.
(Clears throat)

24:48.110 --> 24:50.749
He was with me when
he heard the first bell.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.149
Eight rings.

24:52.150 --> 24:54.709
Eight rings? That's Brown Hill.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.669
Yes. Then the bell sounded again.

24:56.670 --> 24:59.389
Rod thought it was probably
a false alarm.

24:59.390 --> 25:00.870
He said he'd be right back.

25:01.870 --> 25:04.110
But he never came back.

25:05.550 --> 25:06.629
Right.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.069
And what time was the second bell,
would you say?

25:09.070 --> 25:11.309
Quarter-to-ten.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.669
Hm. That's very precise.

25:13.670 --> 25:19.070
Well, I checked my watch when I...
when I saw Mrs Blake on the street.

25:20.350 --> 25:21.350
Mei Lin?

25:23.270 --> 25:24.589
What was she doing?

25:24.590 --> 25:26.789
I don't know, sir. She was...
She was looking for you.

25:26.790 --> 25:32.590
We spoke briefly, then she went off
in the same direction as Rod.

25:37.270 --> 25:41.669
That was 'Mrs Hewitt', with two 'T's?

25:41.670 --> 25:44.070
And that's a rare spider orchid?

25:45.390 --> 25:48.109
Do you mind if I take
another couple of photos?

25:48.110 --> 25:49.269
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:49.270 --> 25:51.549
would you please gather round
for the prize-giving?

25:51.550 --> 25:52.870
Please take a seat.

25:54.710 --> 25:56.429
This year's flower competition

25:56.430 --> 25:58.429
has been of a particularly
high standard,

25:58.430 --> 25:59.950
making the job of the judges...

26:01.470 --> 26:04.949
Special mention should go
to Mrs Elizabeth Collins

26:04.950 --> 26:06.110
for her outstanding...

26:10.150 --> 26:13.069
Charlie, you're home early.
I hope I'm not intruding.

26:13.070 --> 26:15.270
No, not at all.
Would you like a cup of tea?

26:20.510 --> 26:25.269
Rose phoned me today. She has
something you should probably see.

26:25.270 --> 26:26.670
Really?

26:28.750 --> 26:33.670
I took some photographs this morning
and I got these by pure accident.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.149
Is that Mrs Blake
with Major Alderton?

26:40.150 --> 26:41.709
Yes.

26:41.710 --> 26:44.029
I don't know what any of this means,

26:44.030 --> 26:46.749
but I think Dr Blake should see them.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.630
Have you shown anyone else?

26:49.790 --> 26:51.549
They clearly know one another.

26:51.550 --> 26:54.870
She hasn't mentioned any of this
to the Doc.

26:55.870 --> 26:57.390
I didn't know what to do.

27:00.110 --> 27:03.310
Just leave them with me for now.
Thank you, Rose.

28:19.670 --> 28:20.670
Lucien.

28:20.671 --> 28:22.229
Mei Lin.

28:22.230 --> 28:28.389
Um, that lovely young lady
downstairs, Iris, let me in.

28:28.390 --> 28:29.949
You don't mind, do you?

28:29.950 --> 28:31.550
Of course not.

28:32.630 --> 28:34.309
Where have you been?

28:34.310 --> 28:38.429
Oh, out, walking.
I needed some fresh air.

28:38.430 --> 28:39.750
Yes, of course.

28:41.150 --> 28:45.630
Do you know, I've never asked you
where you go during the days.

28:47.230 --> 28:49.350
Lucien, why are you being like this?

28:52.950 --> 28:57.390
I need to know where you were
at 9:45 last night.

28:58.790 --> 29:01.510
I was here, in bed, reading.

29:13.270 --> 29:15.949
You have no right
to go through my things.

29:15.950 --> 29:17.949
Mei Lin, where did you get it?

29:17.950 --> 29:21.029
I will not be interrogated
by my husband.

29:21.030 --> 29:25.109
You were seen last night
outside the Colonists' Club

29:25.110 --> 29:27.589
at a quarter-to-ten.

29:27.590 --> 29:31.189
Not long after, only three streets
away, a man fell to his death.

29:31.190 --> 29:34.349
This Star of David, as far
as we can tell, belonged to him.

29:34.350 --> 29:39.149
Now you have to tell me
what you know.

29:39.150 --> 29:42.830
Mei Lin, please tell the Chief
Superintendent what you told me.

29:44.630 --> 29:46.949
I heard voices. Shouting.

29:46.950 --> 29:48.749
And a heavy thud.

29:48.750 --> 29:51.190
And I saw a body fall from the tower.

29:52.390 --> 29:56.109
And did you see anyone else,
up the tower, maybe?

29:56.110 --> 29:57.110
No.

29:59.510 --> 30:03.389
And this? Where was this?

30:03.390 --> 30:06.469
I put my hand on his wrist
to check his pulse.

30:06.470 --> 30:08.469
It fell out of his hand.

30:08.470 --> 30:09.989
And you just took it with you?

30:09.990 --> 30:13.310
I didn't even realise I still had it
until I got back to the hotel.

30:14.390 --> 30:18.109
Mrs Blake, why would you not call
for the police or run for help?

30:18.110 --> 30:20.709
I was scared.
Scared of what?

30:20.710 --> 30:24.470
That you'd have me arrested
or deported.

30:26.470 --> 30:29.469
Mei Lin, why didn't you come to me
with all of this?

30:29.470 --> 30:33.669
I'm a Chinese national
in a small town

30:33.670 --> 30:35.829
with a husband who keeps me
in a hotel

30:35.830 --> 30:37.589
while he lives with his housekeeper.

30:37.590 --> 30:39.670
Why would I come to you for anything?

30:42.310 --> 30:44.749
And is there anything else
you may have seen?

30:44.750 --> 30:48.869
A car, it came out from
behind the fire station.

30:48.870 --> 30:50.550
A car?

30:51.550 --> 30:53.549
Well, did it stop?
I don't know.

30:53.550 --> 30:56.269
I don't think so.
Can you describe the vehicle for me?

30:56.270 --> 31:00.429
I couldn't really see. The lights
were too bright in my face.

31:00.430 --> 31:03.270
But there's a chance the driver
may have seen you?

31:08.590 --> 31:11.789
(Sighs) So, we still have
a missing letter.

31:11.790 --> 31:15.229
We have a car at the scene,
but no make, model or colour,

31:15.230 --> 31:17.389
and a Star of David,
but no real suspects.

31:17.390 --> 31:18.589
What about Kirby?

31:18.590 --> 31:21.349
I've got a copy of Rod's agreement
with the RSL.

31:21.350 --> 31:23.269
Seems he's true to his word.

31:23.270 --> 31:25.029
He'd only taken the RSL contract

31:25.030 --> 31:27.109
until the Â£200 that Kirby owed him
was paid back,

31:27.110 --> 31:29.470
and there was only one more payment
left to make.

31:30.510 --> 31:32.829
Only thing that might
connect the two, though,

31:32.830 --> 31:35.149
is the black residue
under Rod's fingernails.

31:35.150 --> 31:42.029
Well, initial testing suggests,
whatever it is, it isn't oil-based.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.509
So, in other words,
it's not boot polish.

31:44.510 --> 31:48.549
In that case we can't hold Kirby,
so let him go.

31:48.550 --> 31:50.430
Uh, Frank.

31:51.630 --> 31:54.189
'Our local heroes.'Yes, I know where
you're going with this.

31:54.190 --> 31:57.389
I've already had Bill and Charlie
talk to the lot of them last night.

31:57.390 --> 32:00.589
Six firefighters,
all at the blaze at Brown Hill

32:00.590 --> 32:02.149
when Rod fell to his death.

32:02.150 --> 32:04.589
Alright.
(Sighs)

32:04.590 --> 32:08.869
Lucien,
if the killer did see your wife,

32:08.870 --> 32:11.270
they may think that
she could identify them.

32:14.790 --> 32:16.332
Yes,
that thought had crossed my mind.

32:30.510 --> 32:34.509
Now, there'll be a man out here
tonight to make sure you're safe.

32:34.510 --> 32:36.230
And where will you be, Lucien?

32:39.030 --> 32:43.229
If you really wanted me to be safe,
we could leave this place.

32:43.230 --> 32:48.190
We could go anywhere. Start again.

32:49.830 --> 32:51.869
I know the army
would take you back...

32:51.870 --> 32:54.830
It's not that simple, Mei Lin.

32:56.030 --> 33:00.590
I can't just...
I can't just leave. Mei Lin...

33:07.510 --> 33:10.790
Dale, I have a few more questions
for you.

33:14.350 --> 33:16.789
You said last night you were
the first volunteer to the station

33:16.790 --> 33:18.309
after the call went out.

33:18.310 --> 33:21.149
Yeah, that's right.

33:21.150 --> 33:24.869
And when did you decide to call The
Courier to tell them about the fire?

33:24.870 --> 33:27.549
It was you that made the call,
wasn't it?

33:27.550 --> 33:30.429
From the station. I was just
following orders, you know?

33:30.430 --> 33:32.949
So, it wasn't your idea?

33:32.950 --> 33:35.269
Mr Lancaster probably told you
to call the paper?

33:35.270 --> 33:39.070
No, we called the captain at his
home, so he could meet us there.

33:40.350 --> 33:42.310
It was Mr Rowe.
I see.

33:43.710 --> 33:45.229
Did you find it odd?

33:45.230 --> 33:48.390
In all the chaos, that you were
asked to notify the press?

33:53.230 --> 33:55.429
Mate... Mate...

33:55.430 --> 33:58.310
...if there's something you need
to say, now's the time to say it.

34:00.990 --> 34:03.869
You know how Rod hurt himself
in a big warehouse fire

34:03.870 --> 34:06.389
about three months ago?

34:06.390 --> 34:10.190
Copped a pretty decent whack
to the head. Broke his wrist.

34:11.190 --> 34:13.630
After he got out of hospital,
he changed.

34:14.750 --> 34:16.510
I reckon the accident
did his head in.

34:18.310 --> 34:19.670
That's why he jumped.

34:20.670 --> 34:24.549
Dale, Rod didn't take his own life.

34:24.550 --> 34:26.070
Someone forced him from that tower.

34:28.510 --> 34:31.310
I thought he jumped.
Who told you he jumped?

34:50.429 --> 34:54.389
Alright, now, you think you
can give me a big breath?

34:56.150 --> 34:58.310
That's good. And again.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.349
Alright.

35:01.350 --> 35:03.509
So kind of you to come
and check on us, Doctor.

35:03.510 --> 35:07.349
Oh, not at all. I promised the
fire brigade I'd call in on you.

35:07.350 --> 35:10.629
You are a champion, aren't you?
Lungs are clear.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.749
I'll just put this away.

35:12.750 --> 35:15.430
He loves fire engines.
Yes.

35:16.430 --> 35:18.710
Here we go, sweetie.
(Whines)

35:20.590 --> 35:24.749
Just lie down. There's a good boy.
Be a good boy for Mummy?

35:24.750 --> 35:28.990
Oh, yes you are.
(Toddler cries)

35:38.430 --> 35:40.389
Come on. Come here, come here.
Patricia?

35:40.390 --> 35:41.429
Yes?

35:41.430 --> 35:43.709
Any idea how the fire started?

35:43.710 --> 35:48.869
Uh... I was sure the stove was off
when I put the children to bed.

35:48.870 --> 35:51.029
And then there was this loud bang,

35:51.030 --> 35:53.269
and suddenly there was this man
pounding on our front door,

35:53.270 --> 35:54.709
telling us all to get out.

35:54.710 --> 35:56.229
Right. A neighbour?

35:56.230 --> 36:00.269
Uh, no, no. Uh... a fireman.
Captain Lancaster.

36:00.270 --> 36:02.150
We could have lost everything.

36:04.390 --> 36:08.709
So, just to be clear,
you didn't call the fire station?

36:08.710 --> 36:12.070
No. Uh, no, we don't have a phone.

36:13.630 --> 36:14.830
Right.

36:17.350 --> 36:18.389
Doctor?

36:18.390 --> 36:21.389
Rose. Just here for, um...
A follow-up story.

36:21.390 --> 36:24.189
Yes, just got some quotes
from the neighbours.Right.

36:24.190 --> 36:26.389
They're very lucky someone
spotted the blaze

36:26.390 --> 36:28.549
and the firies got here
as quickly as they did.

36:28.550 --> 36:31.309
I'm sure the family connection
probably helped.

36:31.310 --> 36:33.590
Family connection?

36:38.470 --> 36:42.069
Doc, Mr Rowe here is just
clarifying some points

36:42.070 --> 36:44.589
from his statement last night
about the fire.

36:44.590 --> 36:46.589
Yes, the one at his cousin's house.

36:46.590 --> 36:50.749
Patricia, isn't it? Lovely girl.
Two gorgeous kiddies.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.029
Very lucky no-one was hurt.

36:53.030 --> 36:55.269
Where were you when the fire
was reported?

36:55.270 --> 36:56.829
I was at the fire station.

36:56.830 --> 36:59.749
I've been covering night shifts,
6pm to 8am.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.749
I took the call at the station house.

37:01.750 --> 37:04.789
I phoned the captain, then
I sounded the bell. Eight rings.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.189
For Brown Hill?

37:06.190 --> 37:08.389
So, the volunteers who couldn't
make it to the fire station

37:08.390 --> 37:09.749
could meet us there.

37:09.750 --> 37:13.189
We didn't have a lot of time.
I made as many calls as I could.

37:13.190 --> 37:16.869
More volunteers arrived,
then we headed out.

37:16.870 --> 37:18.709
Now, if that's answered
all your questions,

37:18.710 --> 37:20.029
I should get back to work.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.030
Uh, one last thing, Mr Rowe.

37:23.750 --> 37:27.509
Dale Hardy mentioned Rod hurt
himself in a warehouse fire

37:27.510 --> 37:28.709
three months back.

37:28.710 --> 37:30.709
Or had that slipped your mind
as well?

37:30.710 --> 37:33.029
Meaning my warehouse?
Yes.

37:33.030 --> 37:34.829
I lost everything in that fire.

37:34.830 --> 37:36.829
My whole business
burnt to the ground.

37:36.830 --> 37:39.069
And Rod Drury almost lost his life.

37:39.070 --> 37:41.109
He did. A falling beam hit him.

37:41.110 --> 37:44.150
We barely managed to get him out
before the whole thing collapsed.

37:47.190 --> 37:50.110
You think this is about
the insurance payout, don't you?

37:51.990 --> 37:53.430
Something like that, yes.

37:55.670 --> 38:00.629
Look... I don't like to speak ill
of the dead...

38:00.630 --> 38:02.749
...but Rod believed I lit that fire.

38:02.750 --> 38:04.989
Demanded I give him
some of the insurance money

38:04.990 --> 38:06.829
or he'd go to the police.

38:06.830 --> 38:09.030
I refused to give him a penny.

38:10.390 --> 38:13.869
You asked. What happens now?

38:13.870 --> 38:16.749
Now we're going to take
your fingerprints.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.989
And you'd better hope they don't
match the partials we found

38:18.990 --> 38:20.429
at the scene of the crime.

38:20.430 --> 38:22.470
Are we clear?

38:26.310 --> 38:27.790
Ah, that's a bugger.

38:29.710 --> 38:33.429
Mr Rowe's prints don't match the ones
we found at the crime scene.

38:33.430 --> 38:34.989
Are you sure?

38:34.990 --> 38:37.429
Well, maybe we can bring Dale in
for questioning.

38:37.430 --> 38:40.669
He knows more than he's letting on,
I can tell you that. Why?

38:40.670 --> 38:43.229
Neither of them were at
the fire station when Rod died.

38:43.230 --> 38:45.709
They were in Brown bloody Hill,
same as me.

38:45.710 --> 38:49.949
Yes, but look, that house is barely
ten minutes from the fire station.

38:49.950 --> 38:52.749
Now, someone could have slipped away
in all the confusion...

38:52.750 --> 38:55.109
Lucien, they have six men,
including my Sergeant,

38:55.110 --> 38:57.269
the family and the bloody Courier
to back them up.

38:57.270 --> 38:58.469
We have nothing.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.309
Which is why we need to release
Mr Rowe.

39:00.310 --> 39:01.669
Right.

39:01.670 --> 39:02.869
First thing tomorrow,

39:02.870 --> 39:05.389
I want every record we have
on the warehouse fire.

39:05.390 --> 39:07.709
Police, fire, insurance reports.

39:07.710 --> 39:09.949
And I want our men out
at the Brown Hill house,

39:09.950 --> 39:13.069
interviewing family, neighbours,
anyone who was there.

39:13.070 --> 39:15.109
Yes, sir.

39:15.110 --> 39:18.509
Ah... Mr Lancaster.

39:18.510 --> 39:19.630
Superintendent.

39:20.630 --> 39:23.709
Some of the boys told me that
you're questioning Theodore Rowe?

39:23.710 --> 39:26.269
Yes, it's just due process,
I'm afraid.

39:26.270 --> 39:27.709
Yes.

39:27.710 --> 39:31.389
Speaking of which, Mr Lancaster,
would you mind terribly

39:31.390 --> 39:33.549
giving us a set of your fingerprints?

39:33.550 --> 39:37.189
We only need the right hand.
Lucien.

39:37.190 --> 39:38.870
You can try.

39:40.390 --> 39:41.470
Thank you.

39:42.670 --> 39:45.190
I trust this isn't too uncomfortable
for you.

39:47.630 --> 39:48.829
Goodness me.

39:48.830 --> 39:50.349
I am sorry, Mick.

39:50.350 --> 39:52.990
Oh, no, it's fine.
I understand due process.

39:54.270 --> 39:56.190
I might wait outside,
if that's alright.

40:01.230 --> 40:03.390
No, it was worth a try.

41:13.510 --> 41:15.269
Jean, are you awake?

41:15.270 --> 41:16.630
Lucien.

41:22.350 --> 41:26.709
Um, I was wondering if
I could, um, ask you something.

41:26.710 --> 41:28.069
Of course.

41:28.070 --> 41:30.989
Earlier when you came to see me
in my study,

41:30.990 --> 41:33.109
what did you say about the smell?

41:33.110 --> 41:34.870
It smelled like mothballs.

41:37.270 --> 41:38.669
Bloody mothballs, of course.

41:38.670 --> 41:40.469
Naphthalene dust.
Oh.

41:40.470 --> 41:43.229
Jean... thank you.

41:43.230 --> 41:45.869
Oh, Lucien,
Alice left a message earlier.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.509
She has results back from the lab.

41:47.510 --> 41:49.389
You need to return her call,
in the morning.

41:49.390 --> 41:50.430
Right.

41:52.350 --> 41:54.549
Well, thank you.

41:54.550 --> 41:56.109
Goodnight.

41:56.110 --> 41:57.270
Yes.

42:28.070 --> 42:30.669
I don't take kindly
to these kinds of threats!

42:30.670 --> 42:32.510
I've been more than patient.

42:33.510 --> 42:36.469
It does not have anything
to do with me!

42:36.470 --> 42:38.469
You agreed to the terms.

42:38.470 --> 42:41.510
If you don't bring him in,
we both know what happens next.

42:44.030 --> 42:47.029
Fine. I'll try one more time.

42:47.030 --> 42:48.350
Tonight.

42:50.030 --> 42:51.390
And he stays.

42:52.470 --> 42:53.750
Until morning.

42:55.150 --> 42:56.470
I'll be watching.

43:18.430 --> 43:20.549
What are we looking for, Doc?

43:20.550 --> 43:23.950
Theodore Rowe's warehouse fire
was over three months ago.

43:47.310 --> 43:48.790
There's nothing here, Doc.

43:58.030 --> 44:00.869
KATHLEEN: He's still bringing me
flowers after all these years.

44:00.870 --> 44:02.190
Rod was here.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.510
And not that long ago
by the looks of it.

44:09.230 --> 44:10.830
Laying flowers for the dead.

44:12.750 --> 44:16.270
The ash we found in his van
came from here.

44:17.710 --> 44:20.669
And those small... fragments

44:20.670 --> 44:24.389
of what we thought might
have been china or porcelain?

44:24.390 --> 44:28.789
Part of a tooth from an old-fashioned
set of porcelain dentures.

44:28.790 --> 44:30.750
Not combustible. Impossible to burn.

44:31.870 --> 44:35.269
So, the coat... the Star of David.

44:35.270 --> 44:38.469
You think somebody died in the fire
and Rod knew about it?

44:38.470 --> 44:41.989
Yes! The secret
he could no longer live with.

44:41.990 --> 44:44.270
I know somewhere we need to go.

44:55.830 --> 44:56.830
What's all this?

44:56.831 --> 44:58.509
Eli Rosen.

44:58.510 --> 45:01.069
Russian-Jewish immigrant.
He'd been sleeping rough.

45:01.070 --> 45:03.789
In fact, he'd been camping out
at the warehouse on Eureka Street.

45:03.790 --> 45:07.349
Curiously, no-one has seen him
since the fire.

45:07.350 --> 45:09.949
Rod had been doing his own
investigation with the fire.

45:09.950 --> 45:12.509
He told one of the old hobos
that just before he got hit

45:12.510 --> 45:16.349
by an overhead beam,
he saw a body in the flames.

45:16.350 --> 45:20.389
What's more, the hobo told us that
Rod bought Eli's old jacket off him.

45:20.390 --> 45:21.510
Yes.

45:22.510 --> 45:24.789
Rod's colleagues weren't remotely
interested in what he had to say.

45:24.790 --> 45:26.349
He was going to blow the whistle.

45:26.350 --> 45:28.789
He was going to go to the police
with all the evidence,

45:28.790 --> 45:30.830
and he was killed before
he had the chance.

45:31.950 --> 45:33.389
Well, it's a hell of a story,

45:33.390 --> 45:35.669
but none of it helps us
catch Rod Drury's killer.

45:35.670 --> 45:38.589
Kirby's clean and all of our
suspects have watertight alibis.

45:38.590 --> 45:40.589
It's all there.

45:40.590 --> 45:44.869
Mr Rowe on the hose,
Bill and Dale behind him,

45:44.870 --> 45:47.190
then Lancaster on the head inside.

45:48.270 --> 45:50.309
Rose, you were right there
until the very end, yes?

45:50.310 --> 45:53.189
Yes, until just after 11. Then they
all headed back to the station.

45:53.190 --> 45:55.269
Rowe may have had every reason
to want Rod dead,

45:55.270 --> 45:56.830
but he didn't push him
off that tower.

45:59.470 --> 46:01.869
No doubt about it...

46:01.870 --> 46:04.070
...your brother knew a good whiskey.

46:05.350 --> 46:07.030
He certainly did, sir.

46:09.230 --> 46:11.750
Just a pity that he didn't
get to drink it.

46:15.510 --> 46:16.710
To Rod.

46:27.990 --> 46:31.229
Oh, Cec, my dear friend.

46:31.230 --> 46:33.549
I am so sorry,
I feel like I've let you down.

46:33.550 --> 46:36.389
No, not at all sir.

46:36.390 --> 46:38.510
I just feel better knowing that...

46:40.790 --> 46:42.710
...Rod died trying to do
the right thing.

46:44.350 --> 46:49.150
That was him.
Never one to follow blindly.

46:52.150 --> 46:53.830
He was always his own man.

46:56.270 --> 46:58.269
Right to the end.
(Knocking on door)

46:58.270 --> 46:59.790
Excuse me.

47:08.630 --> 47:11.590
Never one to just blindly follow.

47:15.430 --> 47:18.110
(Bell tolls)

47:22.710 --> 47:27.829
Stop! Stop! Everyone calm down.
Who took the call?

47:27.830 --> 47:32.269
I'm sorry. I do beg your pardon.
That was me. False alarm.

47:32.270 --> 47:34.149
What the hell are you playing at?

47:34.150 --> 47:35.389
I'm just...

47:35.390 --> 47:40.189
I'm just testing a theory, Mick,
in relation to that Brown Hill fire,

47:40.190 --> 47:42.509
and I think I've worked it out.

47:42.510 --> 47:47.789
You see, first of all,
someone deliberately set that fire

47:47.790 --> 47:51.429
using naphthalene dust
as an accelerant.

47:51.430 --> 47:53.189
It's made from mothballs.

47:53.190 --> 47:59.349
And then - I love this bit -
smoke bombs.

47:59.350 --> 48:01.509
Look at those.

48:01.510 --> 48:06.189
Easy enough to make.
Saltpetre and sugar mostly.

48:06.190 --> 48:10.349
It's how you create enough smoke
to maintain the illusion

48:10.350 --> 48:12.629
that no-one ever left the scene.

48:12.630 --> 48:14.989
OK, lads, let's go, show's over.

48:14.990 --> 48:16.549
What's the matter, Mr Rowe?

48:16.550 --> 48:19.109
You don't want your men
to hear about the insurance job

48:19.110 --> 48:22.029
you and Mick pulled
that killed a homeless man.

48:22.030 --> 48:25.109
And Rod Drury knew,
and he had the evidence to prove it.

48:25.110 --> 48:28.789
He had the dead man's coat,
partial remains,

48:28.790 --> 48:31.229
and he put it all in a letter.

48:31.230 --> 48:33.029
Didn't he, Mick?

48:33.030 --> 48:37.269
Local hero. Imagine.

48:37.270 --> 48:43.309
Imagine if word got out, people found
out what you and Mr Rowe had done.

48:43.310 --> 48:47.789
'Hero'!
All that would go away, wouldn't it?

48:47.790 --> 48:49.709
You'd be ruined.

48:49.710 --> 48:52.469
But the night Rod died,
we were at the Brown Hill fire,

48:52.470 --> 48:55.149
risking our lives
for people like you.

48:55.150 --> 48:57.349
Yes.

48:57.350 --> 49:00.469
Yes, Mick taking charge
at the head of the hose.

49:00.470 --> 49:02.870
You, Mr Rowe, right behind him.

49:04.470 --> 49:06.949
And where were you, Dale?
Inside the house?

49:06.950 --> 49:08.389
No.

49:08.390 --> 49:10.669
Bill Hobart and I
were feeding the hose at the door.

49:10.670 --> 49:12.709
I see.

49:12.710 --> 49:16.429
Anyone else actually go inside?

49:16.430 --> 49:18.630
No. There was too much smoke.

49:19.630 --> 49:21.190
Too much smoke.

49:23.510 --> 49:27.549
You went back to the fire station,
you sounded that bell a second time

49:27.550 --> 49:29.309
and you murdered Rod Drury,

49:29.310 --> 49:33.389
and then returned to the fire without
anyone even realising you'd gone.

49:33.390 --> 49:36.589
And Rod tried to hold onto you,
didn't he,

49:36.590 --> 49:38.309
to stop himself from falling.

49:38.310 --> 49:42.309
That's how he got the naphthalene on
his hands and under his fingernails.

49:42.310 --> 49:44.270
(Shrieks)

49:46.670 --> 49:50.509
And speaking of hands, Mick,
your hands?

49:50.510 --> 49:53.589
Last night at the police station,
I didn't expect them to be burnt.

49:53.590 --> 49:56.270
Well, certainly not so severely.

49:57.510 --> 50:00.629
You burnt them yourself, didn't you?

50:00.630 --> 50:05.430
After you realised you left that
partial set of prints in the tower!

50:07.390 --> 50:09.749
He's lying.

50:09.750 --> 50:12.869
I've always done the right thing
by my men, by my community.

50:12.870 --> 50:14.830
Yes, of course.

50:17.310 --> 50:21.589
You doctored Rod's letter
to look like a suicide note

50:21.590 --> 50:23.309
and you left it in his pocket.

50:23.310 --> 50:26.469
Now, there was a carbon copy
of the original letter -

50:26.470 --> 50:29.310
I'm sure you've dealt with that -
however...

50:31.070 --> 50:36.190
...it looks like you didn't think
to deal with the carbon paper itself.

50:38.350 --> 50:39.870
You're no hero, Mick.

50:40.870 --> 50:45.030
No. Rod Drury was the hero.

50:46.390 --> 50:50.630
He was never one to just
blindly follow, but he trusted you...

50:51.830 --> 50:55.950
...just like all of these men
trusted you, and you betrayed him.

50:57.830 --> 50:59.710
And you betrayed all of them.

51:01.830 --> 51:02.830
Bill.

51:14.390 --> 51:17.629
(Door opens and shuts)

51:17.630 --> 51:20.989
(Approaching footsteps)

51:20.990 --> 51:24.270
Lucien. Can I pour you a drink?

51:25.590 --> 51:26.590
Please.

51:32.870 --> 51:33.870
Thank you.

51:35.790 --> 51:37.389
Jean, we need to talk.
Lucien...

51:37.390 --> 51:38.830
Please let me.

51:41.470 --> 51:45.430
I should have told you...
honestly how I feel.

51:47.390 --> 51:48.509
That I'm...

51:48.510 --> 51:53.270
That I'm ready to...
to let go of my...

51:54.590 --> 51:58.950
...stubborn sense of duty, and that
the past is just that - it's...

52:00.710 --> 52:01.789
...it's past.

52:01.790 --> 52:03.350
I should have told you...

52:05.070 --> 52:08.149
I should have told you that I'm
finally ready to follow my heart.

52:08.150 --> 52:09.389
(Phone rings)

52:09.390 --> 52:10.710
Please don't get that.

52:16.710 --> 52:18.390
Yes, Dr Lu...

52:21.670 --> 52:22.830
Alright.

52:24.390 --> 52:26.110
Alright, I'm on my way.

52:32.710 --> 52:33.710
Something's happened...

52:33.711 --> 52:35.309
Lucien, I have something to tell you.

52:35.310 --> 52:37.389
I'll be back as quickly as I can,

52:37.390 --> 52:39.789
and we'll finish this as soon
as I get home, I promise.

52:39.790 --> 52:41.390
I promise.

52:43.350 --> 52:44.350
(Sighs)

52:49.110 --> 52:50.190
(Door closes)

53:07.550 --> 53:11.109
Now, Mei Lin,
when we spoke on the telephone,

53:11.110 --> 53:13.630
you said someone threatened you.

53:15.790 --> 53:18.030
Sit down. Please.

53:20.550 --> 53:21.830
Thank you.

53:23.470 --> 53:26.110
I need to tell you about
what happened in Hong Kong.

53:28.670 --> 53:33.790
When I arrived by boat,
when I was put into that camp...

53:35.190 --> 53:36.630
Mei Lin, please don't.

53:37.790 --> 53:41.350
You need to see what they did
to women like me.

53:51.510 --> 53:52.670
Oh, dear God.

53:55.070 --> 53:57.070
Mei Lin, I am so sorry.

54:04.270 --> 54:06.629
Please.
Lucien.

54:06.630 --> 54:08.470
We mustn't.
Lucien.

54:13.030 --> 54:15.630
Our daughter's life depends on it!

54:16.750 --> 54:19.390
Lee? What do you mean?

54:20.630 --> 54:22.549
Mei Lin?

54:22.550 --> 54:26.310
Derek Alderton found me
over a year ago.

54:28.350 --> 54:30.549
He offered to get me out of the camp,

54:30.550 --> 54:34.150
to bring me here, to you...

54:35.870 --> 54:37.830
...if I agreed to help him.

54:39.510 --> 54:42.389
He never told me anything.

54:42.390 --> 54:47.270
He never even told me that Lee
was still alive, not until later.

54:48.950 --> 54:51.110
Not until it suited him.

54:54.990 --> 54:57.670
There's so much that
you need to know.

55:05.030 --> 55:06.030
(Door shuts)

55:06.031 --> 55:08.390
(Approaching footsteps)

55:25.510 --> 55:27.590
I should have given these to you
sooner.

55:30.190 --> 55:31.470
(Sighs)

55:37.390 --> 55:39.189
She's been meeting with him
behind your back.

55:39.190 --> 55:40.950
I didn't know how to tell you.

55:42.230 --> 55:43.590
It's alright, Jean.

55:45.470 --> 55:47.430
It's alright, I know.

55:50.630 --> 55:52.070
She told me.

55:54.190 --> 55:55.990
Alderton's been using her.

55:57.390 --> 55:59.709
Blackmailing her,
threatening my family.

55:59.710 --> 56:01.990
All to get to you?

56:03.150 --> 56:04.750
I promise you this.

56:07.230 --> 56:10.790
I promise you,
I will make things right.

56:20.390 --> 56:21.390
(Gasps)

56:21.391 --> 56:23.390
What the bloody hell is going on?

56:26.670 --> 56:29.390
Sounds well-planned to me.
Quite impressive.

56:30.630 --> 56:32.390
Cheers.
Cheers.

56:40.830 --> 56:42.030
I am sorry.
