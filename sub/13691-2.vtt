WEBVTT

00:08.741 --> 00:10.534
(CAR HORN BLARING)

00:14.788 --> 00:18.332
Well,
old man, the great day dawns.

00:18.416 --> 00:21.501
Absolutely.
But, you know, Kilwillie,
I have this strange feeling...

00:21.585 --> 00:24.504
-You're not ill, are you?
-Sweating palms, palpitations,

00:24.588 --> 00:27.506
inability to concentrate,
uncontrollable shaking.

00:27.590 --> 00:31.177
-Nothing out of
the ordinary there, then.
-Absolutely not! Come on!

00:34.596 --> 00:38.183
Ah. My beauty.

00:38.266 --> 00:42.102
My Lagganmore
Peculiar come home at last.

00:42.186 --> 00:45.147
-I've tried to take
care of her for you.
-I'm very grateful.

00:45.230 --> 00:48.941
You'll get a reward,
don't worry.
Come on, it's almost time.

00:49.025 --> 00:50.485
Is it safe?

00:50.568 --> 00:53.653
Molly's out in the real world,
no sign of Archie at all.

00:57.531 --> 01:01.118
-What was that?
-What? What? Come on!

01:11.877 --> 01:13.712
That's it.

01:13.796 --> 01:15.713
Gently. Gently.

01:45.655 --> 01:51.202
Just think, when you set
this wondrous
malt aside to mature,

01:51.285 --> 01:53.120
all those years ago.

01:53.202 --> 01:55.372
Thirty years ago to the day.

01:55.455 --> 01:57.957
Thirty years.

01:58.040 --> 02:03.336
When I was as debonair
as Cary Grant and my forehead
was a mass of golden curls.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.673
That was a very long time ago.

02:06.756 --> 02:12.426
Don't forget. Not
a word about this to anyone,
especially you know who.

02:12.511 --> 02:14.555
Just hold it right there.

02:15.930 --> 02:18.141
Don't even think about it.

03:06.931 --> 03:12.728
So, is there anything special
about this
Lagganmore Peculiar?

03:12.811 --> 03:15.105
Well, you mean apart from
it being extremely valuable...

03:15.189 --> 03:17.857
Nothing special at all!

03:17.940 --> 03:20.943
If that's the case,
why are you being so shifty?

03:21.027 --> 03:23.236
-Fair point.
-Will you be quiet?

03:23.320 --> 03:26.656
Anyone would think
you'd drunk
a pint of it already!

03:26.740 --> 03:31.994
Right, I think I'm
going to confiscate this,
pending further inquiries.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.287
You can't, it's mine!
I'm head of the family!

03:34.369 --> 03:37.916
And I am the laird. It's my
responsibility to make the
most of the estate's assets,

03:37.999 --> 03:39.917
-whatever they are.
-Is nothing sacred?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.252
You've flogged
practically everything,
including most of my wine!

03:42.336 --> 03:45.421
-Finders keepers!
-Losers weepers!

03:50.218 --> 03:52.385
Possession is nine
tenths of the law.

03:52.469 --> 03:55.806
Whisky's meant for drinking,
damn it!

03:55.889 --> 03:59.934
I'm not gonna take this
lying down, Kilwillie.
Oh, dear me, no.

04:01.102 --> 04:03.020
Chocks away, chaps.

04:06.648 --> 04:08.817
-Have you seen this?
-DUNCAN: What?

04:08.900 --> 04:14.154
Don't tell me. Queen Victoria
has just bought a bungalow in
a place called Balmoral?

04:14.238 --> 04:18.491
If we don't stop
Archie doing this,
you and me are finished, son.

04:21.868 --> 04:24.788
But,
Golly, we've known for ages
that Archie was gonna hire

04:24.870 --> 04:26.873
another sad
schmuck to work in here.

04:26.956 --> 04:30.251
That was to run
the visitor centre.
This is something else.

04:30.334 --> 04:33.586
-Head ranger?
-Head ranger.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.839
Seems to me that title
carries certain implications.

04:35.922 --> 04:37.966
Yeah, like he's gonna head...

04:39.258 --> 04:41.593
Well, the ranges.

04:41.677 --> 04:44.221
Those ranges are mine.

04:44.303 --> 04:46.514
And have been for
the last 20 years.

04:48.599 --> 04:51.727
This is the end
of the old order.

04:51.810 --> 04:55.147
-Maybe me with it.
-Oh, Golly, don't be daft.

04:55.230 --> 04:57.773
You'd better believe it, lass.

04:57.856 --> 04:59.984
He's got to be stopped.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.820
Well, as long as you don't
expect any help from
Albert Einstein there.

05:07.699 --> 05:09.366
GOLLY: Duncan!

05:09.450 --> 05:11.744
Do you not realise
how serious this is?

05:11.827 --> 05:14.580
Our whole future's
under threat here.

05:14.663 --> 05:17.165
You're supposed to be a man,
not a stupid boy!

05:18.541 --> 05:21.043
Now grow up! Act your age!

05:28.299 --> 05:30.426
Now remember to leave your
names on your paintings

05:30.509 --> 05:32.553
otherwise I've no idea
whose they are.

05:32.636 --> 05:35.221
ARCHIE: Miss, miss.

05:35.305 --> 05:38.349
-What are you doing here?
-Sorry. Is it a bad time?

05:38.433 --> 05:39.725
No.

05:41.310 --> 05:44.980
-How've you been?
-Yeah, you know, all right.

05:45.064 --> 05:47.231
-Have you spoken
to Justine yet?
-No.

05:49.442 --> 05:52.652
Anyway, have you seen
the advert for the new job?

05:52.736 --> 05:54.488
Uh-huh.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.823
I was wondering if you might
give me a hand
with the interviews?

05:56.907 --> 06:00.284
-Yeah, sure.
-Great.

06:00.367 --> 06:02.787
Just,
I need someone to help me
outvote my father

06:02.870 --> 06:05.621
'cause he's bound to
want the wrong person.

06:05.705 --> 06:08.833
-Listen, I really better go.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:08.917 --> 06:12.252
Why don't you
come round later?
We can talk about it.

06:12.336 --> 06:16.297
-And I'll even
make you some supper.
-Oh, that'd be great. Yeah.

06:18.007 --> 06:20.676
-See you later.
-Okay, I'll see you later.

06:25.430 --> 06:27.556
ALL: Whoo!

07:11.093 --> 07:12.678
(WHOOPING)

07:32.445 --> 07:36.698
He's right, you know.
I'm no good to man nor beast.

07:36.781 --> 07:38.700
Get away, daft lad!

07:38.783 --> 07:41.285
-You're great.
-At what?

07:41.368 --> 07:46.539
Give me a few hours and
I'll think of something.
I'm only joking.

07:46.622 --> 07:51.585
You're good with beasts, with
machines, and you're good
with people, too.

07:51.668 --> 07:54.129
You're just good to
have around, wee man.

07:55.797 --> 07:58.632
-Do you really think so?
-Yeah.

07:58.716 --> 08:02.595
I mean, you could really go
places, as long as you
believed in yourself.

08:02.678 --> 08:04.345
How can I? Golly doesn't.

08:04.429 --> 08:07.474
Well, show him. And Archie.

08:07.557 --> 08:09.058
Yeah, but how?

08:27.948 --> 08:29.825
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

08:29.909 --> 08:31.118
Hang on!

08:36.164 --> 08:37.248
Okay.

08:40.042 --> 08:42.669
Sorry, have you got a minute?

08:42.753 --> 08:44.921
Yes, sure. Come in.

08:46.297 --> 08:50.468
It's...
It's about this head ranger.

08:50.551 --> 08:55.514
Listen, Golly, I want you to
know whoever we appoint won't
have anything to do with you.

08:55.597 --> 08:58.681
-Okay?
-Right.

08:58.766 --> 09:02.727
I mean, you'll still be your
own boss, in charge of
the sporting side,

09:02.812 --> 09:07.565
and then the ranger will look
after hikers, climbers,
trails, things like that.

09:07.649 --> 09:08.650
Mmm.

09:10.818 --> 09:14.113
You'll both be
reporting to me separately.

09:14.196 --> 09:16.322
Yes, yes.

09:16.406 --> 09:18.658
-Well, unless...
-Unless what?

09:21.076 --> 09:23.704
Unless I get the job myself.

09:23.787 --> 09:26.540
You'll have my application
by the end of the day.

09:31.794 --> 09:34.713
Golly? Golly.

09:39.174 --> 09:40.300
Archie?

09:41.927 --> 09:43.595
Mother, I need your help.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.685
Ah, Golly, a moment
of your valuable time.

09:51.768 --> 09:53.937
-You've just been with Archie?
-Uh-huh.

09:54.021 --> 09:56.481
Did you notice...

09:56.565 --> 09:59.150
Was there any sign of...

09:59.233 --> 10:00.901
That'll cost you.

10:00.985 --> 10:02.902
What? Oh. Very well.

10:02.986 --> 10:06.698
Oh, Hector, behave yourself.
I'm talking favours, right?

10:06.781 --> 10:09.241
-You mean,
a gentleman's agreement?
-Uh-huh.

10:09.324 --> 10:13.120
Splendid.
Whatever you say. Well?

10:13.203 --> 10:15.955
It's in his room.
Under the wee table.

10:32.595 --> 10:33.887
It's locked.

10:40.351 --> 10:42.269
(RATTLING)

10:48.733 --> 10:51.068
Lex, do us favour and
post this for me, please?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.528
Sure. How is she?

10:55.364 --> 10:58.532
I don't know.
It's just a few
things she left behind.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.869
Oh, and I won't be in
for supper tonight either.

11:02.952 --> 11:05.538
And whose table
will you be
plonking your feet under?

11:05.622 --> 11:09.041
I've got a few things
to talk over with...
With Katrina.

11:09.124 --> 11:11.126
Oh, this week's model.

11:11.210 --> 11:13.295
You don't waste much time.

11:13.379 --> 11:16.422
-Just what point is it
you're trying to make?
-Oh, give me a break!

11:16.506 --> 11:18.466
You're hardly binned
one broken-hearted lassie

11:18.549 --> 11:20.677
and you've got
your philandering
claws into the next.

11:20.759 --> 11:24.179
-It is a perfectly
innocent business meeting.
-Come on!

11:24.262 --> 11:27.640
If you're prepared to stomach
that one's cooking,
then it must be serious.

11:27.723 --> 11:30.059
-Lexie.
-I hope it chokes you.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.698
Oh, aye.
Who's away with my axe?

12:25.022 --> 12:27.648
-Hi.
-You look nice.

12:27.732 --> 12:31.193
So do you. Come in.

12:31.277 --> 12:33.445
Yes. Thank you.

12:35.238 --> 12:38.408
(HECTOR SNARLING)

12:38.491 --> 12:40.909
Ah,
Hector, have you seen Golly?

12:42.995 --> 12:44.330
Oh, right.

12:47.623 --> 12:49.334
(KATRINA LAUGHING)

12:54.379 --> 12:57.006
There's still some tuna
bake if you're still hungry.

12:57.089 --> 13:02.011
No, no.
I'm fine, thanks. It was...
It was very filling.

13:02.094 --> 13:05.597
Is that your way of saying
"No,
thanks, it was really crap"?

13:05.680 --> 13:10.309
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm completely
useless in the kitchen.

13:10.392 --> 13:12.936
Pretty sensational
elsewhere in the house, right?

13:13.020 --> 13:14.812
Archie MacDonald!

13:14.896 --> 13:16.981
That is not the
remark of a gentleman!

13:17.065 --> 13:18.608
Sorry, sorry.
Terrible thing to say.

13:18.691 --> 13:20.859
Must be the drink talking.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.741
You know, when you smile
like that, Sunny Jim...

13:28.824 --> 13:31.827
Gives you a retching feeling
in the pit of your stomach.

13:44.546 --> 13:46.631
-I think we better stop.
-Why?

13:46.714 --> 13:50.093
-'Cause you're
pouring Chianti into my lap.
-Oh, sorry!

13:51.802 --> 13:55.681
-All right.
-Sorry.

13:55.764 --> 13:59.308
-I'll just go
and clean up, okay?
-Sorry.

14:04.229 --> 14:06.231
MOLLY: Come on, boys, come on.

14:06.314 --> 14:10.275
-Lovely evening, isn't it?
-Aye, it is, Molly, it is.

14:10.359 --> 14:12.528
Would you like a beer?

14:12.611 --> 14:15.780
Oh, no thanks.
It always makes me fart.

14:15.863 --> 14:18.783
And we can't have flatulence
amongst
the ruling classes, can we?

14:18.866 --> 14:20.535
That would never do.

14:20.617 --> 14:23.745
It must be my age.

14:23.829 --> 14:28.290
Oh, it is sad, isn't it,
Golly, when one can't do
the things one used to?

14:28.374 --> 14:31.919
I suppose it is. Like?

14:32.003 --> 14:35.422
Well, I knew that Hector and I
would be lost without Archie.

14:35.505 --> 14:37.590
Such good
judgement for one so young.

14:37.674 --> 14:40.634
Ach,
well, he's had good training.

14:40.718 --> 14:44.013
-Much of it from you,
Golly, we all know that.
-Ach.

14:44.096 --> 14:48.391
And I know how he
values your work
as head gillie.

14:48.474 --> 14:53.520
Let's hope he finds someone
half as good for
this ranger thing.

14:53.603 --> 14:55.397
Molly, now you come to
mention it...

14:55.480 --> 14:58.024
And then what
a great team he'll have, eh?

14:58.107 --> 15:00.943
Maturity and
experience on one hand,

15:01.027 --> 15:04.487
and youthful drive
and energy on the other.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.697
Aye.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.241
And we can't be good
at everything, can we?

15:08.325 --> 15:10.534
No.

15:10.617 --> 15:15.872
Oh, listen to me rabbiting on.
Well,
I've enjoyed our little chat.

15:15.955 --> 15:17.999
No problem. Molly?

15:21.376 --> 15:24.338
If Archie thinks I'm
too old for this job,

15:25.589 --> 15:27.715
maybe he just
better tell me himself.

15:58.282 --> 15:59.617
-Okay?
-Yeah.

16:03.620 --> 16:06.081
There's still some
of that wine left
if you want some.

16:06.164 --> 16:10.125
No, I think maybe I've had
enough. I've got to drive
home in a minute.

16:10.209 --> 16:11.377
Right.

16:16.965 --> 16:18.424
Look, I'm sorry.

16:18.508 --> 16:21.760
-Oh, it's no bother.
Don't worry.
-No.

16:21.843 --> 16:24.972
-I meant...
-Oh, right.

16:25.055 --> 16:26.847
Well, yeah, me too.

16:26.931 --> 16:30.518
-It's just that...
-I know. Too soon.

16:30.601 --> 16:34.020
Well, it wouldn't be fair
on her, would it? Or you.

16:34.104 --> 16:38.024
Don't worry about me, Archie.
I can look after myself.

16:40.276 --> 16:41.402
Right.

16:44.696 --> 16:46.739
I'd better head off, then.

16:49.951 --> 16:53.328
-Thanks for supper.
It was great.
-No, it wasn't.

16:53.412 --> 16:56.164
But thanks for saying so.

16:56.248 --> 16:59.083
-I'll see you at
the interviews, yeah?
-Uh-huh.

17:04.546 --> 17:05.547

-Oh!
-Aha! Caught you.

18:06.264 --> 18:08.806
You're not getting
any of this whisky,
do you understand?

18:08.891 --> 18:11.727
-Tomorrow I'm going
to call Sotheby's.
-Archie, you can't.

18:11.810 --> 18:15.688
And they're gonna sell it for
loads of cash which I'm gonna
plough into the estate,

18:15.772 --> 18:19.150
and you are not gonna
drink a single drop, okay?

18:19.233 --> 18:23.111
Look, son, I'm an old man.

18:23.195 --> 18:27.281
Very few pleasures left.
Have a heart.

18:27.365 --> 18:32.535
I don't have one. So go away
and leave me and my barrel
alone to sleep in peace.

It's just a thought,
you know with all
this stuff going on...

Oh, no, no.
You did right, Duncan.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.299
Thought we'd
better check it out.

19:38.382 --> 19:40.926

put a foot wrong
these past months.

19:41.010 --> 19:43.012

for a fresh challenge.

19:45.972 --> 19:47.599
That's just what
Lexie was saying.

19:47.682 --> 19:50.559
Listen, Duncan,
I'm sorry if I spoke
harsh words to you.

19:50.642 --> 19:54.104
-I mean, that was
completely out of order.
-Oh, no. No bother, Golly.

19:54.187 --> 19:57.648
-I'm just glad you think
I'm up to this new job.
-Huh?

19:57.732 --> 20:00.192
What, hey, come here,
come here. Come here.

20:01.444 --> 20:04.821
What do you mean, new job?
Huh?

20:04.904 --> 20:08.407
Well, you're...
You're not suggesting...

20:08.490 --> 20:11.452
You're not suggesting
you've applied for
the ranger's job?

20:11.535 --> 20:13.954
-You can't do that.
-Can't I?

20:14.038 --> 20:15.788
That's my job.

20:15.872 --> 20:18.249
I'm talking about you
taking over as the gillie.

the top of your head?

21:02.119 --> 21:04.621
Who needs them?
Heard you coming
about 10 minutes ago.

21:04.704 --> 21:06.706
Did you?

21:06.790 --> 21:08.874
If your eyes are as good
as your ears, you'll know
you're trespassing.

21:08.958 --> 21:12.878
And you must know there's
no such enforceable
offence in Scottish law.

21:19.050 --> 21:21.927

need to hang around.
I can do these by myself.

the wrong way last time.

that silly nonsense.

talk to you about Golly.

-Archie, there's
someone here for you to see.
-Who's that?

nicking all the stuff. Him.

-How's it going, Archie?

-Good.
-Listen, sorry about this.

22:24.605 --> 22:26.606
Yeah.
Fergal's applied for the job.

22:26.689 --> 22:29.317

a couple of
days on the estate,

get to know
the place better, you know.

up with you later, yeah?
-Yeah, sure. No problem.

I know, I'm sorry,
I should have said something.

with all that's going on...
-Better late than never.

good an opportunity to miss.

Golly, Golly,
have you thought about this?

23:27.031 --> 23:29.951
I've thought about it
very carefully, Archie.

And you're happy to go up
against the likes
of Fergal and Duncan?

maybe think I'm just a wee bit
too long in the tooth for it.

-No.

five generations.

38:53.804 --> 38:57.598
Of course,
I understand that the times
they are a-changing.

38:58.558 --> 39:00.727
You might look
at me and think,

39:00.810 --> 39:04.855
"Good old Golly.
Nice chap, good at his job,

39:06.898 --> 39:11.694
"but you can't teach
an old dog new tricks."
Well, you'd be wrong.

39:11.777 --> 39:16.322
I might not have
some fancy degrees
from some fancy university,

39:18.408 --> 39:21.869
but I do have
something other folk don't.

39:21.952 --> 39:23.036
Passion.

39:23.912 --> 39:25.455
(RUMBLING)

40:16.122 --> 40:19.750
-Fergal,
this is Katrina Finlay.
-Hello. Again.

40:19.833 --> 40:21.418
Hi.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.253
You've already met?

40:23.337 --> 40:26.005
Well, you could say that.

40:27.715 --> 40:30.093
FERGAL: I mean, just a few
days here tells you

40:30.176 --> 40:32.969
the glen has a quite
staggering biodiversity.

40:33.053 --> 40:36.640
I think what we have to
achieve is a means of
protecting and promoting it,

40:36.723 --> 40:40.017
while also increasing
visitors and income.

40:40.101 --> 40:41.727
But how would you do that?

40:41.811 --> 40:44.396
Well, it's quite
straightforward really.

40:44.479 --> 40:46.940
You just
encourage the people to go
where the diversity isn't,

40:47.023 --> 40:50.025
by means of tracks and signs
throughout the estate.

40:50.109 --> 40:53.278
Actually, I've just finished a
project to achieve
the same objectives.

40:53.362 --> 40:55.613
Where was that?

40:55.697 --> 40:57.532
Botswana.

40:57.615 --> 41:02.369
-I've always
wanted to go there.
-Yeah, the Okavango Delta.

41:02.452 --> 41:07.289
Oh, I loved it, you know.
I mean, not just the place,
but the people too.

41:07.373 --> 41:09.709
-It's brilliant.
-I can imagine.

41:11.043 --> 41:14.254
Yeah. Sorry.

41:16.339 --> 41:17.966
(PANTING)

41:23.887 --> 41:25.722
Fergal, you've fantastic
qualifications,

41:25.805 --> 41:28.599
you've travelled and worked
all over the world,

41:28.683 --> 41:31.309
why would you want
to come to Glenbogle?

41:31.393 --> 41:35.063
I don't know. Maybe
it's time to settle down,

41:35.939 --> 41:37.732
put down some roots.

41:40.192 --> 41:41.444
Great.

41:41.527 --> 41:44.029
-If you wouldn't
mind waiting outside?
-Sure.

41:44.112 --> 41:45.864
I smell a rat.

41:45.947 --> 41:48.158
I don't believe
all this flannel.
You're hiding something.

41:48.241 --> 41:51.368
-Father, please!
-No, it's all right, Archie.

41:54.705 --> 42:00.501
When I was in Africa,
my brother got ill and I had
to come back to help him.

42:00.585 --> 42:03.962
They took one
of my kidneys out
and stuck it in him.

42:04.755 --> 42:06.548
Wow.

42:06.631 --> 42:09.717
Anyway,
it's all worked out okay,

42:09.800 --> 42:14.012
but the doctors have asked me
to hang around
for a while so...

42:14.095 --> 42:16.890
I need a job.

42:16.973 --> 42:21.685
I'm so sorry to disturb you,
but the person
concerned was insistent.

42:21.769 --> 42:23.604
Hector, I've been asked to
tell you that the

42:23.687 --> 42:27.690
horse has unseated its jockey
at the Canal Turn.

42:32.944 --> 42:34.404
I'm so sorry.

42:37.990 --> 42:40.076
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

42:40.159 --> 42:42.870
-I don't think that
whisky wants to be drunk.
-Kilwillie, I told you...

42:42.952 --> 42:45.330
If you ask me,
the bally thing's
got a mind of its own!

42:45.413 --> 42:47.749
Oh, don't be so ridiculous!

42:52.753 --> 42:53.962
Yes!

43:07.598 --> 43:12.019
-Oh, thanks, Lex.
-So, ready for
the big decision, eh?

43:13.353 --> 43:16.231
Let me guess.
Hector'll go for Golly.

43:19.024 --> 43:21.193
She'll go for Fergal.

43:22.444 --> 43:24.780
So you'll hold
the casting vote.

43:25.863 --> 43:27.782
Only at the top, eh, Arch?

43:49.883 --> 43:54.304
MOLLY ON RADIO:
Kilwillie, Kilwillie.

44:00.892 --> 44:02.561
Yes, Molly. Over.

44:03.603 --> 44:05.939
Are you looking for these?

44:12.445 --> 44:14.154
Oh.

44:14.237 --> 44:17.866
Molly, give them back, please!

44:17.949 --> 44:20.409
-Come on now.
-Be a good girl.

44:20.492 --> 44:25.455
Molly, as you know, I am not
a man of violence,
but I must have those keys!

44:27.457 --> 44:28.624
Molly.

44:33.462 --> 44:36.214
First rule of management:
Promote from within.

44:36.298 --> 44:38.341
Disastrous for morale
to do otherwise.

44:38.424 --> 44:40.301
Yes, but who?
Golly or Duncan?

44:40.384 --> 44:42.011
Golly, of course!

44:42.094 --> 44:44.387
I must confess
Duncan surprised me.

44:44.471 --> 44:47.140
I've often cursed the boy,
but he now seems to
have hidden depths.

44:47.223 --> 44:49.308
But let's face it,
he's far too young.

44:49.391 --> 44:52.436
Yeah, Duncan impressed me too,
but he doesn't hold
a candle to Fergal

44:52.519 --> 44:55.229
in terms of
experience and expertise.

44:55.313 --> 44:56.773
And what about Golly?

44:56.856 --> 45:00.859
Golly is a fantastic asset,
but is he right for this job?

45:00.942 --> 45:03.737
Surely it's better to have
them all working for you.

45:03.820 --> 45:07.281
After all, Fergal has
perfect qualifications.

45:07.365 --> 45:09.950
I think we should
grab him with both hands.

45:10.034 --> 45:13.328
-Most apt.
-What?

45:13.411 --> 45:19.541
Well, are you sure you're not
backing him because of his
other qualifications?

45:19.625 --> 45:23.962
Right. I go for Golly,
she goes for Fergal.
It's up to you, Archie.

45:24.837 --> 45:26.255
What are you gonna do?

45:31.426 --> 45:35.097
Fergal, would you
join us again, please?

45:35.180 --> 45:39.725
Golly, Duncan, I'd like to
talk to you in a couple of
minutes if that's okay.

45:41.686 --> 45:44.354
Laddie, wait.

46:07.832 --> 46:09.750
Duncan.

46:09.834 --> 46:13.712
-Look, I'm sorry.
-Stupid. That's our Duncan.

46:13.795 --> 46:16.381
-As if you'd ever give
that kind of job to me.
-Listen...

46:16.464 --> 46:17.549
Stupid.

46:19.049 --> 46:22.261
But it doesn't mean
I don't have dreams, you know.

46:22.344 --> 46:24.804
Things I want to
do with my life.

46:27.140 --> 46:30.393
Duncan, how would you
like to be Fergal's deputy?

46:34.730 --> 46:38.107
Look, I'm sorry. I really
thought Fergal was
the best man for the job.

46:38.190 --> 46:39.734
Obviously.

46:39.817 --> 46:43.528
Not content with that,
you gave him Duncan.

46:43.611 --> 46:45.655
Golly, I want to say to you
that there is

46:45.739 --> 46:49.116
no one around
here more valuable
to me than you

46:49.199 --> 46:51.493
professionally and personally.

46:51.577 --> 46:53.787
Actions speak
louder than words, sir.

46:56.205 --> 46:59.792
Archie,
I'm just gonna show Katrina
the otter hole that I found.

46:59.876 --> 47:01.710
-All right. Good.
-See you later, Arch.

47:01.793 --> 47:05.630
-See ya.
-You know, thanks again.

47:05.714 --> 47:07.590
I think I'm really
gonna love it here.

47:07.673 --> 47:09.884
I'm sure you will.
You'll do a great job.

47:12.844 --> 47:15.055
FERGAL: Katrina, wait up.

47:16.848 --> 47:19.850
-So, have you ever
seen an otter before?
-Oh, yes.

47:28.650 --> 47:31.193
Well?

47:31.276 --> 47:34.571
Some might say
you're the biggest
fool in Scotland.

47:35.864 --> 47:38.032
Not me.

47:38.115 --> 47:41.243
What you did today
took guts and integrity.

47:43.119 --> 47:45.497
You've gone a long
way up in my estimation.

47:47.332 --> 47:49.541
If that's any comfort.

47:49.625 --> 47:50.918
Thanks, Lex.

47:59.676 --> 48:00.801
Come on.

48:04.346 --> 48:05.555
(SIGHING)

48:14.187 --> 48:15.647
What are you doing?

48:15.730 --> 48:18.358
We are just taking your
whisky for a walk, Archie.

48:18.441 --> 48:21.235
-Aren't we, Kilwillie?
-Kilwillie!

48:21.318 --> 48:23.779
I'm sorry, old man.
She cut me off at the pass.

48:23.862 --> 48:25.571
Molly, you had no right!

48:25.655 --> 48:28.366
Kilwillie and I have made
a little deal, haven't we?

48:28.449 --> 48:30.493
A deal?

48:30.575 --> 48:33.787
Kilwillie, I was once told
that when you were a tubby
little tyke at Eton,

48:33.870 --> 48:37.707
you used to cheat at conkers.
I didn't believe it until now!

48:37.790 --> 48:42.003
The last Lagganmore Peculiar
to come up for auction went
for Â£600 a bottle.

48:42.086 --> 48:47.048
This cask will
fill 20 bottles,
and I will give you 15 grand,

48:47.132 --> 48:49.133
plus one bottle back.

48:49.216 --> 48:52.011
-What, for Father?
-No.

48:52.094 --> 48:54.637
For your first-born, Archie.

48:54.721 --> 48:56.806
My little stipulation.

49:01.560 --> 49:05.147
-Archie,
I've brought the cheque.
-Excellent.

49:05.230 --> 49:08.024
This should just
cover Fergal's salary
for the first year.

49:08.107 --> 49:10.192
HECTOR: How marvellous.

49:13.445 --> 49:14.529
Thank you.

49:16.698 --> 49:18.907
Oh, what a day.
I need a drink.

49:18.991 --> 49:23.120
-MOLLY: It's almost teatime.
-No,
no, mother, a proper drink.

49:23.203 --> 49:28.291
A legendary drink. A drink
to ward off evil spirits and
ungenerous thoughts

49:28.374 --> 49:29.959
and general unhappiness.

49:30.043 --> 49:33.337
-Ooh, what a very good idea!
-Archie, you don't mean...

49:34.630 --> 49:36.922
What do you say, Kilwillie?

49:38.215 --> 49:41.302
Oh, why not? Come on.

49:41.385 --> 49:44.471
Let's all get as
squiffy as 40 billy goats.

49:44.554 --> 49:46.931
A fabulous day at last!

49:50.517 --> 49:52.811
KILWILLIE:
Well, magical moment.

49:52.895 --> 49:55.938
-To your first-born, Archie.
-And don't hang about.

49:56.022 --> 49:58.274
Well,
the way things are going,
I wouldn't hold your breath.

49:58.358 --> 50:00.234
-Slainte.
-ALL: Slainte.

50:17.040 --> 50:18.874
It's gone off.

50:18.958 --> 50:21.752
Tough luck, old man.
It's gone off.
