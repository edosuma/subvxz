He's in serious condition,

09:36.271 --> 09:37.620
and Kyle's prepping him
for surgery.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.796
Yeah, he's right
through those doors.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.061
Well, Dallas can't die.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.934
He's the one with all the
video game cheat codes. [laughs]

09:48.152 --> 09:50.415
Sorry. Uh...

09:50.459 --> 09:52.940
Yay! Childhood
coping mechanisms.

09:52.983 --> 09:57.074
I just... I... I have to
make jokes, or I'll lose it.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.337
Put me to work, Roswell.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.775
I need to think
about anything but Dallas.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.822
KYLE:Okay. Nice and easy,
no sudden movements.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.259
So long as you keep holding the
more precariously-placed shards,

10:08.303 --> 10:10.479
we should be able to mitigate
any permanent damage.

10:15.049 --> 10:18.618
Oh, my God.
Oh, that is gross.

10:18.661 --> 10:20.794
While I appreciate
the extra set of hands,

10:20.837 --> 10:23.448
you don't have to stay.
I can call Max.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.015
Oh, no. I can't do the, uh,

10:25.059 --> 10:27.191
pacing-around-the-hallways
like-a-madwoman thing.

10:27.235 --> 10:30.934
Also, technically,
these are parts of my sword.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.501
I do need them back.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.765
And it's my fault
that Dallas is here.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.768
Oh, no. Jones did this.No.

10:38.812 --> 10:41.771
That's exactly my point.
I let Jones into my head.

10:41.815 --> 10:44.644
I let him get under my skin.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.646
This whole time
I've been thinking

10:46.689 --> 10:49.649
I'm some badass,
fearless warrior.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.476
[scoffs]

10:51.520 --> 10:53.870
It turns out
I am nothing like my mother.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.309
I let my insecurities
get the best of me.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.529
And now look.

11:00.572 --> 11:03.967
My new brother has shards
of my careless mistake

11:04.011 --> 11:06.491
lodged in his body.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.668
You're not the only one

11:08.711 --> 11:10.713
whose insecurities
are being triggered.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.976
[sighs]

11:13.020 --> 11:16.327
I took my dad's legacy,
and I made it my own.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.808
I saw a new opportunity
with Deep Sky, but here I am,

11:18.852 --> 11:21.681
panicking like a med student
doing his first rotation.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.204
Kyle.

11:24.422 --> 11:27.208
Every time we have
faced a problem

11:27.251 --> 11:30.341
with our physiology,
you have risen to that occasion.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.604
You literally invented
a new branch of science

11:32.648 --> 11:34.389
to save my brother.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.914
You never cease to impress me.

11:48.751 --> 11:51.711
[high-pitched ringing]

11:51.754 --> 11:53.930
Don't touch my stuff.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.715
Mind your manners,

11:55.758 --> 11:57.368
or the one-eyed drunk upstairs
gets the heart attack

11:57.412 --> 11:59.022
he's been side-stepping
for half a century.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.895
[high-pitched ringing][Michael groans]

12:04.288 --> 12:05.550
Why the hell are we down here?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.552
Why can't I take pride
in my son's

12:07.596 --> 12:09.598
underground soundproof bunker?

12:10.773 --> 12:13.733
Well, I can't decide
if it's risky

12:13.776 --> 12:15.865
or just plain stupid,
you bringing me home.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.476
And where else,
other than the place

12:18.520 --> 12:22.567
my son crawls into whenever the
world becomes too much for him?

12:22.611 --> 12:25.048
Mm. I get it.

12:25.092 --> 12:28.660
You want to try worming your way
into my head again.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.575
You know, if you
just asked nicely,

12:30.619 --> 12:32.273
I might have given you
the information.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.579
Must be pretty
important,

12:34.623 --> 12:36.930
whatever you're after.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.670
And since I'm
playing the part

12:38.714 --> 12:40.629
of damsel-in-distress
instead of Liz,

12:40.672 --> 12:44.024
it's not just the science
to separate you and Max.

12:46.853 --> 12:50.421
[sighs]
I will break into your mind,

12:50.465 --> 12:51.945
one way or another.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.903
You can't kill me,
off-the-rack Max,

12:53.947 --> 12:56.079
because if I'm dead,
my brain stops working.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.778
And then you can't get
whatever it is you're after.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.825
You're incredibly dense
for a mechanical genius.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.479
Hmm.If I wanted you dead,

13:04.522 --> 13:07.351
you never would have made it
out of Nora's womb.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.007
Haven't you ever wondered
how she evaded me?

13:11.051 --> 13:12.617
Hmm.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.533
Perhaps it's time
I tell you the truth

13:15.577 --> 13:17.622
about your conception.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.277
HEATH:
All right, I'm almost through

13:20.321 --> 13:23.454
transcribing Theo's equation,
but there are still holes.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.717
Some of these symbols
are incomplete.All right.

13:25.761 --> 13:28.546
So, how do we bridge the gap
in the genetic sequence?

13:28.590 --> 13:31.854
[sputters]
Should've paid more attention
in AP Alien Chem.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.856
Oh.
Any luck with
our little fungi?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.858
Uh, I was able to fast-track
the germination process

13:35.902 --> 13:37.512
to produce
some viable stem cells.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.557
They should seal off the
puzzle piece end of Max's DNA.

13:39.601 --> 13:40.950
Great, so,

13:40.994 --> 13:42.125
bust out the champagne?

13:42.169 --> 13:43.648
Hold the ice bucket.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.346
Come take a look.

13:46.347 --> 13:49.741
Huh. Binding receptors
are multiplying.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.395
They're effectively
stopping the peplomers

13:51.439 --> 13:53.963
in Jones' cells from
reattaching to Max's DNA.

13:54.007 --> 13:56.531
Oh.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.231
But at quite the cost.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.233
Without the complete equation,
it's like

14:03.277 --> 14:06.758
we are duct-taping a solution
instead of actually fixing it.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.369
MAX:
Any breakthroughs?

14:08.412 --> 14:11.154
And that is my cue

14:11.198 --> 14:13.548
to, uh, be elsewhere.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.162
Thought maybe we could talk

14:19.206 --> 14:21.164
about Jones' offer
over some caffeine.

14:21.208 --> 14:24.689
I'm not mad. I just...
I worry about you.

14:24.733 --> 14:27.170
Jones offered to
advance my science

14:27.214 --> 14:30.608
in exchange for extending
the telomeres in your body.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.349
It was a trick

14:32.393 --> 14:34.003
to get me to undo the science
that keeps him

14:34.047 --> 14:35.875
from being able
to clone himself.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.442
I am not gonna
turn my back on you.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.096
Which is why
you should know

14:40.140 --> 14:42.838
we are getting close
to figuring out a solution.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.363
My plan is to inure your DNA
against rejoining his

14:46.407 --> 14:50.759
with a treatment of stem cells
from Noah's spores.

14:50.802 --> 14:53.109
I'm certain it'll...

14:53.153 --> 14:55.503
interrupt the tether, only...

14:57.244 --> 14:58.636
Only what?

15:00.856 --> 15:03.946
A-According to everything
we know about the science,

15:03.990 --> 15:05.513
this serum...

15:07.167 --> 15:09.821
It'll take away your powers.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.486
JONES:
I understand

15:22.530 --> 15:25.098
why you hold Nora
in such high regard,

15:25.141 --> 15:27.622
but those placed on pedestals
are bound to fall.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.929
You get my mother's name
out of your damn mouth.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.931
Perhaps I should tell you
about your mother's mouth.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.280
[electrical hissing, popping]

15:34.281 --> 15:37.110
Once up a time,
she was my right hand,

15:37.153 --> 15:38.589
until the rebels
clouded her judgment

15:38.633 --> 15:39.982
and turned her against me.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.766
My mother was good![glass breaking]

15:41.810 --> 15:44.508
And you're nothing
but a damn liar.

15:44.552 --> 15:48.077
Maybe. Maybe not.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.644
That's the beauty of it.

15:49.687 --> 15:52.429
Broken children cling
to fairy tales

15:52.473 --> 15:55.084
that tell them
they can be mended.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.477
Yours is Nora.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.957
I barely scratched
the surface

15:58.000 --> 15:59.784
of your subconscious,
and I can already tell,

15:59.828 --> 16:03.614
you are by far the most broken
of your entire precious triad.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.616
You don't deserve a family.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.706
You're weak,
and that's why

16:08.750 --> 16:11.274
you will try and fail to stop me

16:11.318 --> 16:12.667
from getting into your head.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.364
[grunts softly]

16:18.325 --> 16:20.370
[elevator bell dings]

16:21.763 --> 16:23.721
You lost?

16:23.765 --> 16:25.288
Snack bar's on level five.

16:25.332 --> 16:29.684
Uh, no, no. I was just,
uh, trying to clear my head.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.121
What you doing
with the machine?

16:32.165 --> 16:34.123
I'm honestly just trying
to keep myself busy

16:34.167 --> 16:35.646
so that my brain'll
stop thinking

16:35.690 --> 16:37.300
about worst-case scenarios.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.389
You need help?

16:39.433 --> 16:42.871
I, uh, was starting to feel
like a nuisance up in the lab.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.308
No, I'm just thinking
about why this was built.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.311
You know? I mean,
Nora made it seem like

16:48.355 --> 16:51.184
it was built for something more
than just a "phone E.T."

16:52.402 --> 16:54.491
It reads frequencies,
right, so I'm wondering,

16:54.535 --> 16:56.363
if I can alter it in some way
to find Jones,

16:56.406 --> 16:57.755
then it'll lead us to Michael.

16:57.799 --> 16:58.930
You think that'll work?

16:58.974 --> 17:00.541
I'm grasping at straws,

17:00.584 --> 17:02.499
but I got to do something.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.501
I get it, man.

17:04.545 --> 17:08.157
And it's much easier to act
then to react, right?

17:08.201 --> 17:10.029
You know, when I was, um...

17:10.072 --> 17:12.161
when I was dying,

17:12.205 --> 17:14.685
[laughing]:
I... I wrote all these letters

17:14.729 --> 17:16.165
to people I cared about,

17:16.209 --> 17:18.689
and they just ended up
in a hole in the ground.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.518
Yeah, I just couldn't
face anything head-on.

17:21.562 --> 17:24.043
You know, it was the only way
I knew how to cope.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.045
So,

17:26.088 --> 17:27.698
hell, if you need
to bang on that machine

17:27.742 --> 17:30.745
to not break, I get it.

17:34.009 --> 17:36.664
[grunts]
Maldita sea.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.971
I'm guessing
that's not Spanish for "huzzah."

17:40.015 --> 17:43.236
I don't know how to separate
Max and Jones permanently

17:43.279 --> 17:45.803
without affecting the alien
proteins in Max's DNA.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.110
Okay.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.069
[clears throat][sighs]

17:50.112 --> 17:52.941
[sighs]
Come on, Roswell.

17:54.986 --> 17:57.337
Tell me what's really going
through that brain of yours.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.604
Jones offered me
everything I want.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.649
And even though

18:05.693 --> 18:08.130
deep down I knew I would
never take the deal,

18:08.174 --> 18:10.306
part of me did
wonder "what if."

18:14.136 --> 18:16.834
God, he knew exactly what to say

18:16.878 --> 18:18.836
to trigger
my biggest insecurities.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.275
He knew exactly what
I hate about myself.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.755
I want validation.

18:24.799 --> 18:28.150
And no matter how hard
I try to be satisfied,

18:28.194 --> 18:30.413
it is never enough.

18:30.457 --> 18:33.764
I want the next thing,
I want the...

18:33.808 --> 18:36.419
bigger thing,
I want the Nobel,

18:36.463 --> 18:39.814
the Frozen Moe's.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.251
Nobel I know.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.166
Moe's, less so.

18:44.210 --> 18:47.343
Anytime I, um...

18:47.387 --> 18:51.173
did well growing up,
my mom wasn't there.

18:51.217 --> 18:54.045
"La proxima vez, muñeca."

18:54.089 --> 18:55.873
"Next time, I will take you
to Frozen Moe's,

18:55.917 --> 18:58.528
and we will celebrate
with ice cream sandwiches."

18:58.572 --> 19:00.313
Every spelling bee,

19:00.356 --> 19:02.053
every science fair...

19:02.097 --> 19:03.968
Nothing merited her committing.

19:04.012 --> 19:07.276
Nothing made Frozen Moe's real.

19:07.320 --> 19:11.672
What exactly is real
in this case?

19:11.715 --> 19:13.543
I mean, take a look around you.

19:13.587 --> 19:17.852
You are in a top-secret
scientific chocolate factory

19:17.895 --> 19:19.854
that would make Genoryx
wet their pants.

19:19.897 --> 19:24.554
So... who cares

19:24.598 --> 19:26.730
what the next thing is?

19:27.731 --> 19:31.648
Does it make me a bad scientist
if I stop asking "what if?"

19:31.692 --> 19:35.913
'Cause right now, I just want
to block out the possibilities,

19:35.957 --> 19:41.180
the Frozen Moe's, and just fix
this one problem for us.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.748
Even if it means
no one will ever benefit

19:44.792 --> 19:47.403
from what was achieved here.

19:48.404 --> 19:51.102
Either way,

19:51.146 --> 19:53.844
you are a hero to the people
in this building.

19:53.888 --> 19:57.370
And, quite honestly, a round
of margaritas with them

19:57.413 --> 19:59.415
kind of sounds better
than a prize

19:59.459 --> 20:02.070
on some shelf
that has to be dusted.[laughs]

20:02.113 --> 20:03.593
Hmm.

20:05.595 --> 20:08.598
Okay, now will you tell me what
the Spanish is for "huzzah"?

20:10.470 --> 20:12.689
[inhales through nose]

20:12.733 --> 20:15.605
Come on, vision.
I know you want to be seen.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.396
Ugh.

20:37.410 --> 20:38.889
Tarot cards.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.978
Maybe that'll trigger things.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.157
Huh.

20:47.158 --> 20:51.598
I've removed most of the pieces
that were threatening the heart.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.948
Lucky for Dallas, there's
no visible nerve damage.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.907

And because you are, well,
you're probably wondering,

23:31.453 --> 23:33.890
while you were trying
to push into my mind,

23:33.934 --> 23:35.936
did you leave the back door
to yours unlocked?

if I can uncover the truth.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.596

you need Theo's equation.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.923
I don't want to kill you.

24:06.967 --> 24:10.753
Right. Because you're not
the eat-your-young type.

24:10.797 --> 24:14.627
But you are the kind of guy
who'd murder his own triad.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.286

in the oasis.

24:22.330 --> 24:25.115
It rained for the first time
in a while,

24:25.159 --> 24:27.640
and you held a sword
that should've drawn its energy

24:27.683 --> 24:29.772
from its triad,
just like any other.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.471
But yours wouldn't charge,
would it,

24:34.995 --> 24:36.779
My triad was holding me back.

24:36.823 --> 24:39.390
Well, it's like Max
and Isobel do to you.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.523
You found a loophole
to charge up your sword.

24:41.567 --> 24:45.527
A way to corrupt its power
by taking life after life,

24:45.571 --> 24:47.964
starting with the members
of your own triad.

24:48.008 --> 24:50.532
You murdered your family
for power.

24:50.576 --> 24:51.968
Last chance, Michael.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.709
I don't want
to do this the hard way.

24:53.753 --> 24:56.146
But if you don't give me
the information I need...

Okay, so the first time
Michael popped the back

25:12.859 --> 25:15.165
of the machine open, he said
that it felt familiar somehow.

25:15.209 --> 25:18.517
So, maybe he's the key.

25:18.560 --> 25:22.521
Uh... uh, this
is weird, um, but

25:22.564 --> 25:24.348
Michael leaves his handanas
all around my place,

25:24.392 --> 25:26.220
and I don't think
he ever washes them.

25:26.263 --> 25:29.789
So maybe some trace DNA
will pop the trunk.Okay.

mean by that?

of defeating Jones

33:45.545 --> 33:47.590
[laughs]
Oh.

33:47.634 --> 33:49.679
[groans]

33:49.723 --> 33:53.335
I'm not sure
how much longer I can hold on.

33:53.379 --> 33:55.250
You know, it's...

33:55.294 --> 33:57.252
it's, like, the hardest thing
I've ever done--

33:57.296 --> 33:59.167
just trying to survive.

33:59.211 --> 34:00.951
It's different.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.911
It's-it's different
when you're the one

34:03.954 --> 34:05.391
that needs the comforting.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.090
I didn't know
if you were coming,

34:09.134 --> 34:11.092
if anyone was coming.

34:12.746 --> 34:15.053
Yeah. I...

34:16.750 --> 34:19.753
Look, man, you've always thought
the world of me.

34:19.796 --> 34:21.885
Uh, I guess I just
couldn't stand the thought

34:21.929 --> 34:23.626
of not living up
to your expectations.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.628
You're my family.

34:25.672 --> 34:30.198
I'm not gonna turn my back
on you 'cause you stumble once.

34:30.242 --> 34:33.593
Everyone makes mistakes.
It's... [exhales]

34:33.636 --> 34:36.944
It's what you do afterwards--
that's-that's what defines us.

34:45.518 --> 34:48.086
Liz needs that last little bit
of your dad's equation.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.566
I-I promise

34:50.610 --> 34:52.394
I will make things right,

34:52.438 --> 34:56.181
but I am gonna need a little bit
of that classic Dallas guidance.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.276
MAX:
Sorry for bolting.

35:05.538 --> 35:09.150
I, uh... I had an
itty-bitty, teeny-tiny,

35:09.194 --> 35:12.284
very-tough-cowboy
existential crisis.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.112
When you told me
there was a chance

35:14.155 --> 35:16.766
that I would no
longer be what I am,

35:16.810 --> 35:18.116
the first thing that
ran through my mind was

35:18.159 --> 35:19.639
whether or not
you'd still love me

35:19.682 --> 35:22.294
if I was actually just a guy
from Roswell.

35:24.034 --> 35:27.516
You are not justanything
to me, Max.

35:27.560 --> 35:32.826
And whatever,
whoever you are, I...

35:32.869 --> 35:34.654
I love you.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.830
I always will.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.702
I love you, too.

35:39.746 --> 35:43.358
So, let's finish
this serum.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.143
What do you need?

35:45.186 --> 35:46.622
First I need something

35:46.666 --> 35:48.189
I've been meaning
to do for a very long time.

35:51.845 --> 35:54.282
Kiss me, Max Evans.

35:54.326 --> 35:57.459
[door opens]

35:57.503 --> 35:59.505
Ugh. Sorry.
My timing is...

35:59.548 --> 36:02.160
terrible. You want me to come
back in? I can turn around.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.987
No. All good.
How's Dallas?

36:04.031 --> 36:07.034
He's in good hands,
and luckily,

36:07.077 --> 36:10.342
I had someone to talk me out
of making another mistake.

36:10.385 --> 36:14.911
Sorry, Evans, but it looks
like you are gonna get to live

36:14.955 --> 36:17.523
to see another day
as a little green man.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.232
Michael!

36:31.276 --> 36:35.018
[groans softly][groans, pants]

36:35.062 --> 36:36.890
How'd you find me, DeLuca?Intuition.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.587
Oh, my God, don't move.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.241
Don't move, Michael.
You're hurt.

36:40.285 --> 36:43.244
Acetone. Table.

36:45.377 --> 36:46.421
[sighs]

36:50.730 --> 36:53.428
Oh. Okay, we got to go.

36:53.472 --> 36:55.343
The only place
we're going is a hospital.

36:55.387 --> 36:56.953
[clears throat] No.This is a gnarly
wound, Michael.

36:56.997 --> 36:59.260
We got to close it up ourselves.Mm-mm.

36:59.304 --> 37:03.395
I got booze, mechanics glue
and a staple gun.[sighs]

37:03.438 --> 37:05.266
Jones is after
the Lockhart Machine.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.746
He knows it's with Alex.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.269
He's going to Deep Sky.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.576
Please. [panting]

37:13.100 --> 37:14.841
Alcohol's behind the beakers.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.563

37:41.607 --> 37:43.783

37:55.316 --> 37:56.926
Either Liz just kissed Max or...

37:56.970 --> 37:58.841
Or it could be Jones.
They might need me.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.930
No, I need you more. I need you
to remove the last shard.

38:00.974 --> 38:02.628
What?The second it's out of his neck,

38:02.671 --> 38:04.456
I'll go in there and close up
before he bleeds out.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.763
I've got better control
with my alien abilities.

38:07.807 --> 38:09.156
All right, you ready?

[high-pitched ringing]

38:14.814 --> 38:15.858
HEATH:Uh, U11,

38:15.902 --> 38:17.773
U12, U5.

38:17.817 --> 38:19.427
We have all of the pieces.

38:19.471 --> 38:21.429
We're just missing
the mystery protein: UX.

38:21.473 --> 38:23.344
Man, it's got to be the key
to repairing the DNA

38:23.388 --> 38:27.130
while making it inaccessible
to Jones' tether, so, close,

38:27.174 --> 38:29.611
but no cigar.

38:29.655 --> 38:32.005
Guys, we are running out
of time.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.703
I'm getting a bad feeling.
This flickering isn't me.

38:34.747 --> 38:38.141
Okay, wh-what if close
enough is the point?

38:38.185 --> 38:40.492
The mysterious protein--
X is an unknown variable

38:40.535 --> 38:42.885
because it is dependent
on the person

38:42.929 --> 38:44.452
we are trying
to separate.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.193
The DNA has to be close enough
to supplement in,

38:46.236 --> 38:48.804
like a-a graft
or a bone marrow transplant.

38:48.848 --> 38:50.806
Oh, my God. The X is like the
hair in the Polyjuice Potion.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.634
Sure.

38:52.678 --> 38:53.983
But if we're lucky enough,
we could bridge the base pairs

38:54.027 --> 38:55.333
without affecting
the alien protein.

38:55.376 --> 38:56.638
Yeah, well, we'd still need DNA

38:56.682 --> 38:58.336
from a member of Jones's
immediate family.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.209
Michael.

39:02.252 --> 39:05.212
What? No. I thought
not-Max had him.

39:07.693 --> 39:10.043
What about his handana?

39:13.873 --> 39:15.657
[gasps]

39:15.701 --> 39:18.094
[groans]Okay.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.227
Okay.

39:20.270 --> 39:21.924
How is it?
Did I do okay?

39:21.968 --> 39:24.057
Yeah. [laughs]

39:24.100 --> 39:26.842
Oh, my God,
Kyle, thank you.

39:26.886 --> 39:28.496
I should be thanking you.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.193
You helped save this man's life.

39:30.237 --> 39:32.152
We make a good team.

39:33.893 --> 39:35.590
What?

39:35.634 --> 39:37.200
I can tell you've wanted to
tell me something all day.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.550
What is it?

[clack, powering up]

39:47.428 --> 39:48.734
Uh...

39:49.561 --> 39:53.086
You don't need Jones's sword
to be a warrior.

39:53.129 --> 39:55.305
You're ready for this.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.443
You did it?

40:02.487 --> 40:05.403
This compound will keep Max
and Jones apart for good.

40:05.446 --> 40:07.100
Right on schedule.

40:07.143 --> 40:10.233
Give me the solution, Elizabeth.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.453
No. I won't let you.Let me?

40:12.497 --> 40:16.065
Since when does Liz Ortecho
care about permission? Ethics?

40:16.109 --> 40:18.720
You don't control who I am
or what I do.

40:18.764 --> 40:20.722
I decide that, and I said "no."

40:20.766 --> 40:22.724

and Valenti,

40:22.768 --> 40:24.726
there's a machine here I want.
Bring it to me,

40:24.770 --> 40:26.946
or I'll be forced
to do something I really enjoy.

40:28.338 --> 40:31.080
So will I.

I'll be forced
to kick your ass.
