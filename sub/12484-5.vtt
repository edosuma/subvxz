00:07.160 --> 00:08.860
Cameron, what dance should I dance.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.970
For the first dance at my
first High School dance?

00:11.000 --> 00:12.330
The Dougie?

00:13.340 --> 00:14.900
The robot?

00:17.010 --> 00:19.140
Dougie the robot?

00:23.950 --> 00:28.080
You just took two of my favorite
things and made them horrible.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.990
Sorry, no ants allowed.

00:34.020 --> 00:36.860
Says who?
The student body president.

00:36.890 --> 00:38.030
Well, I want to talk to him.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.960
You are talking to him.
That's him!

00:42.930 --> 00:44.900
Tough break, kid.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.040
You heard him.
No ants allowed.

00:47.070 --> 00:49.340
I'm not an ant.
I'm a sophomore.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.110
I've known you since kindergarten.

00:51.340 --> 00:53.140
Oh, right!

00:53.180 --> 00:55.910
You were that really tall kid.

00:55.950 --> 00:58.950
Yeah. I peaked early.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.160
Okay, I don't understand.

01:03.190 --> 01:06.190
All my friends said that they
were going to the dance tonight.

01:06.230 --> 01:09.060
They must mean the ant
dance in the ant farm.

01:09.090 --> 01:12.260
I'm sure you'll have a blast.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.300
Come on, chyna!
We're playing musical chairs!

01:20.340 --> 01:23.980
All right. I'll go find
a chair... at my house.

01:24.010 --> 01:25.880
No, I don't think that's allowed,

01:25.910 --> 01:27.880
but let me check the rule book.

01:29.880 --> 01:33.990
Hey! No fair!
I was checking the rule book!

Olive?

Olive? Olive!

02:39.360 --> 02:41.130
This dance is pathetic.

Forget the unicorn. Hit me.
Put me out of my misery.

Don't you want to put your left foot in?

02:51.340 --> 02:52.970
No, I want to turn myself around.

02:55.980 --> 02:57.940
I'll take a glass of yummy worms.

02:57.980 --> 02:59.880
And make it a double.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.220
Coming right up.

03:03.990 --> 03:06.890
So, what's got you down?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.120
I'm getting nowhere with chyna.

03:12.030 --> 03:13.900
She doesn't even know I'm alive.

03:13.930 --> 03:14.930
Maybe you're not.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.070
Maybe you're a ghost.

03:19.270 --> 03:21.170
Hey!

03:21.200 --> 03:22.970
Nope. You're just unappealing.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.270
Time for a new approach, bro.

03:26.980 --> 03:29.910
Check out this book.

03:29.950 --> 03:32.210
It really changed my life.

03:33.220 --> 03:35.220
<i>Sammy sucks his thumb?</i>

03:36.350 --> 03:38.990
Yeah, not that book.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.220
This book.

03:41.260 --> 03:44.290
Ah. <i>How to win a girl</i>
<i>in ten easy steps.</i>

03:44.330 --> 03:48.200
I'm guessing step one is
"don't suck your thumb."

03:48.230 --> 03:52.900
No, it says in order to get a girl.

03:52.940 --> 03:56.310
You have to get in good
with the girl's father.

03:56.340 --> 04:01.810
That's why I'm taking
olive's dad cheese-tasting.

04:01.850 --> 04:05.080
You'll see.
She'll be hitting on me in no time.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.150
Ow!

04:08.220 --> 04:11.050
Wow.
You know your stuff.

04:11.090 --> 04:13.890
You know, I half expected
candy to pour out of him.

04:17.959 --> 04:21.060
Man, I really overdid it last night.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.970
That party was crazy.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.840
The whole thing is kind of hazy to me.

04:26.870 --> 04:30.210
Was there a unicorn there?

04:31.180 --> 04:33.910
I am never.

04:33.950 --> 04:37.250
Eating another piece of candy again.

04:38.150 --> 04:40.050
Ooh, jelly beans!

04:41.250 --> 04:42.950
Hey!

04:43.350 --> 04:45.220
Those are just for display.

04:47.030 --> 04:48.330
What are you doing?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.260
Since they won't let us
into any school dances,

04:50.290 --> 04:53.030
I'm going to wear this to
sneak into prom this spring.

04:53.070 --> 04:55.030
What do you think?

04:55.070 --> 04:57.070
No offense,

04:57.100 --> 04:58.900
but it makes you look a little hippy.

05:00.940 --> 05:03.840
Well, we have to do something.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.980
We can't let the student council.

05:07.010 --> 05:09.850
Keep us from going to school
dances or pep rallies.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.890
What am I going to do with all this pep?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.890
I'm backed up with pep!

05:14.920 --> 05:16.160
You know what you should do?

05:16.190 --> 05:18.130
There's an election coming up.

05:18.160 --> 05:22.100
You should use your pep to run for ant
representative on the student council.

05:23.030 --> 05:24.260
Really?

05:24.300 --> 05:25.900
You think I should?

05:25.930 --> 05:27.170
Absolutely! I mean,

05:27.200 --> 05:31.970
you're smart, you're charming,
you comfortably seat eight.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.140
You know what?
I'll do it!

05:35.170 --> 05:37.310
I'll run for student council.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.180
Great! Let's just get
your name on the ballot.

05:39.210 --> 05:42.910
All you have to do is just record and
submit this nomination statement.

05:44.320 --> 05:49.320
I, chyna parks, nominate
myself for student council.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.060
There. History begins now!

05:52.090 --> 05:53.930
Ooh, good slogan!

05:53.960 --> 05:55.160
No, I mean history begins right now.

05:55.190 --> 05:57.030
We don't want to be late for class.

06:04.970 --> 06:07.140
Hey, Cameron.
Want to watch the game?

06:07.170 --> 06:09.180
No. Every time
we watch baseball,

06:09.210 --> 06:11.880
all you do is make me get food
for you from the kitchen.

06:11.910 --> 06:13.250
Well, that's a family tradition.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.110
I got food for my dad, you get food for me,

06:16.150 --> 06:18.950
and one day, your son
will get food for you.

06:18.990 --> 06:21.020
That is, if you can trick
a girl into marrying you.

06:21.050 --> 06:22.290
You mean like you did?

06:22.320 --> 06:26.020
Exactly! Another
family tradition.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.090
Come on.
Have a seat.

06:28.130 --> 06:31.090
I'll pass. I got this
cool new video game.

06:31.130 --> 06:34.060
<i>Synchronized swimming.</i>

06:34.100 --> 06:36.070
You mean like water ballet?

06:36.100 --> 06:38.870
No, water ballet is for girls.

06:38.910 --> 06:42.110
Synchronized swimming is a man's game.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.880
You look like a flower shop
threw up on your head.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.890
Oh. Hello, Mr. parks.
Is chyna home?

06:55.920 --> 06:58.320
She's not? Oh, no.

06:58.360 --> 07:02.160
Now I am stuck with this
large meat maniac's pizza.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.930
I'm a meat maniac.

07:03.970 --> 07:05.800
You want to come in
and watch some baseball?

07:05.830 --> 07:08.040
Sure, I'm a big fan of the baseball.

07:10.970 --> 07:12.170
Look out, Cameron.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.110
Make room for the kid
with nine kinds of meat.

But sorry. I'm not
old enough to vote.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.260
You're running for ant rep?

08:04.290 --> 08:08.100
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't think you
were running for re-election.

08:08.130 --> 08:11.270
Re-election?
I didn't even run the first time!

08:11.300 --> 08:15.040
Principal Skidmore made me
because no one else would.

08:15.070 --> 08:16.970
She did?

08:17.010 --> 08:19.940
Yeah, you'd have to be an
idiot to run for ant rep.

08:19.980 --> 08:21.980
Cool poster by the way.

08:24.050 --> 08:25.850
Wait.
I don't understand.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.950
What makes being ant rep so horrible?

08:27.980 --> 08:29.950
And thank you.
I made it myself.

08:31.190 --> 08:34.890
You're forced to participate
in every student activity.

08:34.919 --> 08:35.919
What's so bad about that?

08:40.260 --> 08:43.100
Are you sure this is going to be fun?

08:43.130 --> 08:46.000
Of course. This is
going to be super fun.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.240
For us.

08:49.910 --> 08:51.840
Ready?

08:51.880 --> 08:52.980
Fire in the hole!

08:58.180 --> 09:00.250
Maybe we should have done this outside.

09:01.950 --> 09:04.150
Step right up!
Three balls for a dollar!

09:08.060 --> 09:10.090
Congratulations!

09:10.130 --> 09:13.130
You win a jumbo bunny!

09:28.980 --> 09:30.310
What's wrong with the mirror ball?

09:33.250 --> 09:36.320
Angus, get back up there!
You're ruining the mood!

09:40.190 --> 09:42.320
On the bright side,
you'll get to go to prom!

09:44.290 --> 09:47.200

09:47.230 --> 09:50.000
Yeah, well, if no one else ran,

09:50.030 --> 09:52.000
olive would be appointed.

09:52.030 --> 09:53.270
How could she do that to me?

09:53.300 --> 09:55.270
She's got a dark side.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.970
That's what I dig about her.

10:11.900 --> 10:15.070
Okay, I think I got all the posters down.

10:15.110 --> 10:16.840
Now how do I get my name off the ballot?

10:16.880 --> 10:18.140
You can't.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.880
It's all here in black and white.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.180
<i>Sammy sucks his thumb?</i>

10:24.220 --> 10:26.090
Not that book,

10:26.120 --> 10:27.790
this book.

10:27.820 --> 10:28.960
The student council manual.

10:28.990 --> 10:31.160
Section six, paragraph two.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.060
"No backsies"?

10:35.100 --> 10:38.030
Sorry, once you submit
a nomination statement,

10:38.070 --> 10:39.870
there's nothing you can do.

10:40.870 --> 10:41.900
Really?

10:43.840 --> 10:47.210
Angus, is there, like,
a feature on our a.N.T. Pad.

10:47.240 --> 10:51.980
For editing what someone says into
a completely different sentence?

10:52.010 --> 10:54.850
Because that would be awesome.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.190
<i>Angus is four</i>
<i>feet of awesome.</i>

11:00.990 --> 11:03.090

11:03.130 --> 11:06.030

I love that.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.960
<i>I love Angus.</i>
<i>Angus is cool.</i>

11:09.000 --> 11:10.270

take that away from you.

11:18.140 --> 11:22.010
Hey, olive, can you help
me with my campaign?

11:22.040 --> 11:23.280
Someone's running against you?

11:25.110 --> 11:29.780
I mean, sure, anything to help.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.090
No one's running against me.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.250
I just really want to get
my message out there.

11:33.290 --> 11:37.060
I wrote a campaign song and I
need someone to lay a rap on it.

11:38.230 --> 11:42.130
Sure. I guess I could spit
some fire into the m-I-c.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.050
Oh. And the food's on me.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.050
Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't let you
pay those inflated stadium prices.

13:12.090 --> 13:14.020
No, I mean the food is literally on me.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.090
I'll be a mother's kitten...

13:20.800 --> 13:22.830
Yeah, it's all part of the package.

13:22.860 --> 13:25.900
I'm kind, sweet, dependable.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.940
I'll make some girl very happy some day.

13:27.970 --> 13:31.810
Forget that. You make me happy right now.
I'll have one...

13:33.010 --> 13:34.840
Come on, let's get to that game.

13:36.180 --> 13:37.850
You know what?

13:37.880 --> 13:39.780
You guys go have fun.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.920
I'm going to hang out here
with Taffy and envelope.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.060
We're still working on it.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.860
What the heck?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.930
I never nominated myself.

13:56.170 --> 14:00.000
Oh, but you did.
Remember your little rap?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.770
Oliv <i>i, olive Doyle,</i>
<i>nomin Nate mice elf</i>

14:02.810 --> 14:05.940
<i>for stew dent</i> <i>count sill.
Holla!</i> <i>Holla!</i>

14:07.040 --> 14:09.010
You faked my flow!

14:09.050 --> 14:10.880
Hey, I tricked you into running.

14:10.910 --> 14:12.150
Just like you tricked me.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.780
I don't remember that.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.150
Oh, come on!
You have a perfect memory.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.020
You remember everything!

14:22.060 --> 14:24.160
You remember what you wore for
your third birthday party!

14:24.190 --> 14:28.800
Floral cardigan, fuchsia button-down,
lime green tank top and jeans.

14:28.830 --> 14:31.230
I really need to update my look.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.130
No, actually, it looks really cute on you.

14:33.170 --> 14:35.140
All you need to do is add
like a cute purse here.

14:35.170 --> 14:37.800
And then a sparkly belt and that'll be...

14:37.840 --> 14:40.870
What am I doing?
I'm mad at you!

14:40.910 --> 14:44.040
Well, I'm sorry.
I panicked, okay.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.910
I can't be a mirror ball.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.180
I'm afraid of heights.

14:47.210 --> 14:50.220
And mirrors. And balls!

14:50.250 --> 14:54.850
Well, I'll see to it that you mop
the floor with me in this election!

14:54.890 --> 14:57.990
No way. This election is a
huge popularity contest,

14:58.020 --> 15:00.760
and no one is less popular than I am.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.570
Oh, posters.
What happened?

15:14.610 --> 15:17.540
You felt bad about what you
did and you're trying to win?

15:17.580 --> 15:18.980
See for yourself.

15:19.010 --> 15:21.650
Why don't you read my campaign
promises at the bottom of the poster?

15:25.550 --> 15:28.590
"I promise my ideas
will knock you out."

15:32.690 --> 15:35.630
Olive, I am not voting for you!

15:35.660 --> 15:38.630
Your poster punched me seven times.

15:38.670 --> 15:41.770
I wish I were a faster reader.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.770
Good, vote for chyna!
She's awesome!

15:44.810 --> 15:47.640
Stop saying nice things about me.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.640
It won't help anyway.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.650
I hear there's a scandalous video
of me that recently surfaced.

15:58.520 --> 16:03.860
<i>Oh, no.</i> <i>Where will I
put</i> <i>all this toxic waste?</i>

16:03.890 --> 16:08.860
<i>I'll just dump it here</i> <i>and it'll
go right out</i> <i>to the ocean.</i>

16:10.800 --> 16:13.930
<i>Mmm. That smells</i>
<i>really toxic.</i>

16:18.910 --> 16:21.440
This is terrible!

16:21.480 --> 16:23.840
There goes my political career!

16:23.880 --> 16:25.540
No one will vote for me.

16:25.580 --> 16:29.650
Now that they know about
my hatred of mother earth!

16:31.620 --> 16:34.550
Guess you're going to kick my butt now.

16:52.710 --> 16:53.910
Now rocket split!

16:54.910 --> 16:57.580
Into the twirl!

16:57.610 --> 16:59.880
Now into the flamingo...

16:59.910 --> 17:01.680
Hey, dad!

17:02.850 --> 17:04.650
What are you doing?

17:04.690 --> 17:07.560
I got two tickets to the movies tonight.

17:07.589 --> 17:10.730
So, who are you taking?
Taffy or envelope?

17:10.760 --> 17:12.829
No, I thought we could go together.

17:12.859 --> 17:16.530
I even figured out a way to
sneak in fresh, hot popcorn.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.599
Check it out.

17:20.869 --> 17:25.480
Plus, I've got salt and butter in my pants.

17:33.950 --> 17:37.550
Ow! Cameron,
what are you doing?

17:37.590 --> 17:38.750
Seeing you spend time with Fletcher.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.820
Made me miss hanging out with you.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.600
Remember how we used to play catch?

17:45.630 --> 17:48.700
You'd throw the ball, I'd run and Chase it.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.830
And sometimes, when we
couldn't find the ball,

17:50.870 --> 17:52.740
you'd throw a stick.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.810
Are you crying?

17:55.840 --> 17:59.510
Yeah. I got a hot kernel
right in the eye!

18:02.810 --> 18:05.520
But I do miss those days.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.650
How about we give Fletcher the tickets.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.460
And you and I go outside.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.490
And I'll watch you Chase
the neighbor's Cat. Yes!

18:15.560 --> 18:16.830
That's a great idea!

18:16.860 --> 18:18.700
Maybe I can take chyna.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.700
Just the two of us. Alone.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.730
Think you can make
that happen, d-bomb?

18:22.770 --> 18:25.840
Wait a minute.
I see what's going on.

18:25.870 --> 18:28.810
You're just using my dad
to try to get to chyna.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.810
Like it says in that
stupid book Angus gave me.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.640
Is that true?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.750
If it were, would that make
me a resourceful go-getter.

18:36.780 --> 18:41.520
Worthy of your support, praise, and,
when the time comes, your blessing?

18:41.550 --> 18:43.820
No, that would make you stupid.

18:43.860 --> 18:45.690
Chyna doesn't care about my opinion.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.560
Nobody does.

18:47.890 --> 18:49.490
He's right.

18:49.530 --> 18:51.760
Cameron, let's get to that movie.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.500
Let me go change first.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.700
But you look fine.
Yeah,

18:55.730 --> 18:57.840
but the butter just melted.

19:07.550 --> 19:10.650
How dare you pass out these
cupcakes with my name on them?

19:10.680 --> 19:13.520
They are delicious!

19:13.550 --> 19:15.550
Look, I had no choice.

19:15.590 --> 19:18.820
You published that glowing profile
of me in the school newspaper.

19:18.850 --> 19:22.690
I looked beautiful in that picture!

19:22.730 --> 19:25.460
Hey, girls.
The most recent poll results are in.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.700
Ninety eight percent of boys think
I'm the prettiest girl in school.

19:28.730 --> 19:32.530
The other two percent were absent.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.870
Oh, and olive, you're currently
favored to win ant rep.

19:35.910 --> 19:38.840
So, what size cannon do you wear?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.510
Ha ha! Winner!

19:46.850 --> 19:48.550
Attention, students,

19:48.590 --> 19:52.890
if elected, I vow to get us more
homework each and every night.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.660
Oh, no, you don't!

19:55.690 --> 19:57.860
Vote for me and I'll make
sure we go to school.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.800
Seven days a week!

20:01.830 --> 20:04.530
I will insist that the cafeteria.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.540
Serve nothing but brussels
sprouts and cauliflower!

20:07.570 --> 20:09.840
I'll outlaw use of the Internet!

20:09.870 --> 20:11.470
When you need to look things up,

20:11.510 --> 20:14.780
you'll have to go to this
building called a library.

20:14.810 --> 20:17.780
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's enough!

20:17.810 --> 20:20.580
You girls have it all wrong.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.620
The students need less homework!

20:22.650 --> 20:25.690
Fewer school days!
No vegetables!

20:25.720 --> 20:27.660
That ant is right!

20:31.860 --> 20:33.860
We need easier classes!

20:33.900 --> 20:37.800
No math! Lesser grammar!

20:37.840 --> 20:42.670
Yeah, lesser grammar!
That's the goodest idea I ever hear!

20:49.880 --> 20:51.780
Attention students!

20:51.810 --> 20:53.620
The election results are in.

20:54.780 --> 20:58.520
Yes, I won student body president again!

20:58.550 --> 21:00.590
Long live the queen!

21:00.620 --> 21:02.490
Who won the ant seat?

21:02.530 --> 21:04.860
Ah, that.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.760
In a shocking landslide victory...

21:07.800 --> 21:09.660
Please be olive, please be olive.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.530
...With 507 votes...

21:12.570 --> 21:14.500
Please be chyna, please be chyna.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.870
...The new ant rep is.

21:16.910 --> 21:19.710
Write-in candidate
Cameron parks!

21:19.740 --> 21:21.840
What?
What?

21:21.880 --> 21:25.550
I won?
I finally won something?

21:25.580 --> 21:26.950
Looks like we lucked out.
Yeah!

21:27.780 --> 21:29.520
Sorry I set you up.

21:29.550 --> 21:32.860
Yeah. I'm sorry I said all
those nice things about you.

21:34.730 --> 21:37.790
Wait, how could Cameron win?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.930
He isn't even an ant.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.800
Ooh, look, jelly beans.
Oh, man!

21:43.900 --> 21:46.900
According to student
ordinance 12, section five,

21:46.940 --> 21:48.670
the ant rep can be any student,

21:48.710 --> 21:50.970
provided they are under 5' tall.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.580
Why does height matter?

21:52.610 --> 21:54.780
So you can fit in the cannon!

22:02.520 --> 22:05.490
Ooh, nice try.
Want to go again?

22:05.520 --> 22:06.790
I've been trying for an hour.

22:06.820 --> 22:08.730
Don't give up!

22:08.760 --> 22:10.630
Let me get a corn dog first.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.600
No, you have to win me!

22:12.630 --> 22:14.630
I don't want to go home
with a total stranger!

22:20.600 --> 22:22.470
Winner!

22:22.510 --> 22:24.740
Never mind, dad, I'm good!

22:24.940 --> 22:26.140
