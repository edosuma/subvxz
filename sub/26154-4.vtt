[siren wails, stops]

00:07.674 --> 00:08.926
[car door opens, closes]

00:09.343 --> 00:12.012
<i>-Sir, please get back into your car.</i>
<i>-Here's how it's gonna go down.</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:13.180
<i>You're gonna let me go.</i>

00:13.263 --> 00:16.600
<i>If you're lucky,</i>
<i>I might even honk your... boobies!</i>

00:16.683 --> 00:18.018
<i>Whoa! Hey! Hey!</i>

00:18.101 --> 00:20.354
<i>-for assaulting a police officer.</i>
<i>-You're arresting me?</i>

00:20.437 --> 00:22.397
<i>You must be new here,</i>
<i>on the rag, or both.</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:25.692
<i>I'm movie star Vance Waggoner,</i>
<i>and I hate Jews!</i>

00:26.568 --> 00:28.070
[drums] This is the<i> Deep Dive!</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:32.199
My guest today recently said some things,
or did some things?

00:32.282 --> 00:34.785
I only read the headline.
Vance, what happened?

00:34.868 --> 00:35.827
[sighs]

00:35.911 --> 00:37.829
First of all, I don't hate Jews.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.915
If I did, would I be able to sit
in the same room

00:39.998 --> 00:42.376
as my good friend Mark Feuerstein, a Jew?

00:42.876 --> 00:45.170
You know, when I first heard
Vance's comments, they stung,

00:45.420 --> 00:49.299
but when he called to offer his apology
and a supporting role in his next movie,

00:49.383 --> 00:52.094
I thought, "Does not the Torah
teach us to forgive?"

00:52.177 --> 00:54.930
As it is written, "schmear, don't smear."

00:56.098 --> 00:59.017
[drums] Hey! Good to see you.
Thanks for coming, everyone!

00:59.101 --> 00:59.935
[camera clicking]

01:00.018 --> 01:02.688
Hey! Hey, Vance, did you get practice
swinging that baseball bat

01:02.771 --> 01:05.566
from the time you hit that prostitute,
with a baseball bat?

01:05.649 --> 01:07.317
What? Who told you that?

01:08.860 --> 01:12.072
I'm Tom Jumbo-Grumbo,
and this is<i> Gotcha!</i>

01:12.155 --> 01:14.741
Vance Waggoner,
you hit a woman with a baseball bat.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.159
What's your side of the story?

01:16.243 --> 01:17.869
Okay, look,
when that altercation occurred,

01:17.953 --> 01:22.082
I was an immature child... of 38.
I'm not that guy anymore.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.834
Vance Waggoner respects women.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.629
We have a tape of a voicemail you left
for your 14-year-old daughter.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.340
-Oh, God.
-Let's give it a listen, shall we?

01:30.424 --> 01:31.717
-[tone beeps]
<i>-I'll murder you.</i>

01:31.800 --> 01:35.178
<i>I'm going to murder my daughter.</i>
<i>I don't respect women.</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:39.349
<i>You're out there, hanging out</i>
<i>with your dirty Swedish friends.</i>

01:39.433 --> 01:41.184
<i>That's right, I hate Swedes now.</i>

01:41.268 --> 01:42.644
<i>I bet you didn't see </i>that <i>coming,</i>

01:42.728 --> 01:45.689
<i>-you disgusting slut, who is my </i>daughter!
-[tone beeps]

01:45.772 --> 01:49.276
As we say here on<i> Gotcha,</i>
that's<i> a gotcha.</i>

01:49.359 --> 01:51.570
Why did I go on a show called<i> Gotcha?</i>

01:51.862 --> 01:53.113
[camera shutters clicking]

01:53.238 --> 01:56.742
I stand here with my wife beside me,
and my daughter,

01:56.825 --> 01:58.827
and my good friend Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.954
-I am retiring from public life.
-[press corps gasps]

02:01.038 --> 02:03.540
This is the last you'll see
of Vance Waggoner.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.796
Who are we gonna get
to play Philbert's partner?

02:09.880 --> 02:12.758
We need a bad boy.
Someone dangerous,

02:12.841 --> 02:17.095
someone you see coming
and think, "This guy is trouble."

02:18.388 --> 02:20.390
You know who would be perfect?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.685
[theme music playing]

03:16.071 --> 03:17.698
[growls, grunts]

03:21.618 --> 03:23.787
-Thank you so much for meeting me.
-Of course.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.247
I know how busy you are.

03:25.330 --> 03:29.459
The Apology Tour can be a hassle,
but you've been handling it perfectly.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.877
What do you have lined up next?

03:30.961 --> 03:34.131
Well, I'm getting the lifetime achievement
at the We Forgive You Awards.

03:34.214 --> 03:38.009
You're getting a Forgivie?
Damn, your publicist <i>is </i>good.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.262
I don't care about awards.
I just want to work, damn it.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.180
You just have to remind them
how good you are.

03:42.264 --> 03:46.226
Maybe by taking a meaty role on my gritty,
prestige television show<i> Philbert.</i>

03:46.309 --> 03:48.979
Once word gets out
that it's okay to hire you again,

03:49.062 --> 03:52.607
all the other offers will come rolling in.
Producers are like lemmings.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.151
-Hey, I resent that!
-Me, too!

03:54.234 --> 03:57.320
-I also resent that. To the cliff!
-Yeah, let's go.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.031
I have a great deal of love and respect
for the lemming community!

04:00.615 --> 04:01.908
Okay, I'm in.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.997
Diane, can you believe this?

04:07.080 --> 04:10.500
Vance Waggoner is getting
a We Forgive You Award!

04:10.584 --> 04:12.836
Ugh! This town is full of hypocrites.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.339
They act all shocked when one of their
favorite stars turns out to be a dirtbag,

04:16.423 --> 04:19.634
but they can't wait to give a comeback
to all the dirtbags we already know about.

04:19.718 --> 04:23.054
Now, that is the kind of story
I would share without reading,

04:23.138 --> 04:25.849
which, for our purposes,
is even better than people reading.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.184
Go to the awards show,

04:27.267 --> 04:29.853
take down that skeevy so-and-so,

04:29.936 --> 04:33.023
and then during commercial breaks,
get in some Hollywoo hobnobbing.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.443
-Oh, I'd rather not.
-Diane, you have to hobnob.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.820
Have you not been hobnobbing?
Hob that nob, girl!

04:38.904 --> 04:41.740
We know how this ends.
Our core readership eats it up,

04:41.823 --> 04:44.075
a bunch of dude-bros
call me a "dumb slunt,"

04:44.159 --> 04:45.952
and Vance's career chugs, right along.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.247
So, stellar! And while you're there,
you can ask your friend BoJack,

04:49.331 --> 04:51.625
why Vance is gonna co-star
on his new TV show.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.251
He's what? Oop! Aaaah!

04:53.418 --> 04:55.670
[explosive music]

04:56.379 --> 04:58.089
Greetings, from the red carpet!

04:58.173 --> 05:02.093
Filling in for a Mario Lopez-type,
'tis I, Mr. Peanutbutter!

05:02.177 --> 05:03.261
-And lookie here!
-[yelps]

05:03.345 --> 05:07.432
Super-producer and also my manager,
Princess Carolyn!

05:07.516 --> 05:08.725
Who are you wearing

05:08.809 --> 05:11.478
and why haven't you called,
about the<i> Dog Day Afternoon</i> reboot?

05:11.561 --> 05:12.813
-Uh...
-It's cool. We can talk.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.440
-They cut around stuff they don't need.
-Oh, okay.

05:15.690 --> 05:19.903
No one understands how to make a woman
feel beautiful like Louis Kitton.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.615
Listen, kid.<i> Dog Day Afternoon</i>
isn't gonna happen for you.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.243
-People don't see you as the tough guy.
-That's not fair.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.119
Who are you excited to see tonight?

05:28.203 --> 05:31.081
So many amazing stars
are being forgiven tonight.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.375
Megyn Kelly, Mark Wahlberg...
[laughs]

05:33.542 --> 05:35.252
Look, every actor has a range,

05:35.335 --> 05:37.587
and maybe a gritty drama
about a tough-guy bank robber

05:37.671 --> 05:39.130
is too much of a stretch for you.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.591
So, I'm not tough enough, huh?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.594
I'll show them how tough I can be.

05:45.428 --> 05:50.350
We'll be back with more of the Red Carpet
Pre-Show Fashion-Stravaganza,

05:50.433 --> 05:53.895
so don't touch that remote...
[growls] or else.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.146
[choral music playing]

05:56.022 --> 06:00.443
There is no one this town loves
forgiving more than Vance Waggoner.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.361
[applause]

06:01.736 --> 06:03.280
I just don't get why you're doing this.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.615
-We need a big star, Diane.
-No, Diane's right.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.367
-I'm the big star.
-That's not my point.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.077
You can't have two stars.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.163
All the greatest detective shows
are focused around a central,

06:12.247 --> 06:13.957
usually titular character.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.167
Kojak, Monk, Nickis.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.961
-Who's Nickis?
-You know, Nickis.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.755
Sometimes, he goes to Los Angeles,
to New Orleans...

06:20.839 --> 06:24.676
Are you...? Do you mean<i> NCIS?</i>

06:24.885 --> 06:26.052
No.

06:26.136 --> 06:29.639
Princess Carolyn, if you hire this guy,
what kind of message does that send?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.808
Diane, we both know
the industry is screwed up.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.185
I'm not talking to the industry.
I'm talking to you.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.896
-Take some responsibility.
-Excuse me?

06:35.979 --> 06:36.813
Hey! Cheese plate!

06:36.897 --> 06:38.648
...Vance Waggoner!

06:38.732 --> 06:40.317
[cheering, applause]

06:41.985 --> 06:43.069
-Ugh!
-[camera clicks]

06:43.737 --> 06:47.282
Horseman forcefully forgoes applause
for Vance at Forgivies!

06:47.365 --> 06:49.492
Is a feud forming on the<i> Philbert</i> front?

06:49.576 --> 06:53.079
That's the buzz around town,
and the question on everybody's mind is,

06:53.163 --> 06:54.664
"Why the strong face?"

06:55.165 --> 06:59.127
He made the face in protest because
of what Vance said about native Alaskans.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.088
BoJack's clearly upset
about the time Vance Waggoner

07:02.172 --> 07:07.302
said the Madrid train bombings
were "a real mixed bag."

07:07.552 --> 07:10.347
Remember when Vance locked
that shopgirl in a hotel room

07:10.430 --> 07:14.809
and said, "I've got pizzazz"
while masturbating into a champagne flute?

07:14.893 --> 07:17.062
Because BoJack remembers.
[slurps]

07:17.145 --> 07:21.524
God damn it! The whole point of the award
was to put the past behind me.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.069
But now,
because of this idiot's dumb face,

07:24.152 --> 07:26.529
my past is all anyone's talking about!

07:26.613 --> 07:28.823
Everyone else was clapping.
Why couldn't you clap?

07:28.907 --> 07:31.326
Hey, man, awards show
should've had better cheese.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.829
-My publicist is furious, by the way.
-Ooh, spooky publicist!

07:34.913 --> 07:37.499
Hope she doesn't papercut me
with her mad press release.

07:37.582 --> 07:38.667
We're gonna handle this.

07:38.750 --> 07:43.088
BoJack will go on TV and explain
this unfortunate<i> faux pas du fromage.</i>

07:43.171 --> 07:45.465
-Won't you, BoJack?
-Ugh. Fine.

07:45.548 --> 07:49.636
Once again, hero BoJack will clean up
everyone else's mess.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.558
-Hello, Todd.
-Ooh!

07:56.351 --> 07:59.604
Did you notice how I just walked in
without knocking? Pretty tough, huh?

07:59.688 --> 08:00.522
Not at all!

08:00.605 --> 08:02.774
To me, it read as amiable and familiar,

08:02.857 --> 08:05.902
like our friendship has an assumed
"open door" policy.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.154
God damn it! [thumps] Owie!

08:08.279 --> 08:10.824
Apparently, Hollywoo producers
don't think I'm tough enough

08:10.907 --> 08:12.492
to play the bad boy parts.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.995
-Oh, no!
-Todd, you're the toughest guy I know.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.204
[giggles]

08:16.287 --> 08:20.500
-Will you teach me how to be tough?
-I thought you'd never ask.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.795
Because I had no idea
this was happening to you.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.214
-[audience applauding]
-[music playing]

08:27.632 --> 08:31.261
BoJack, clear the air.
Why'd you give Vance the face?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.721
Well, there was this cheese--

08:32.804 --> 08:34.305
And you're lactose intolerant,

08:34.389 --> 08:36.558
which reminded you
that Vance lacks tolerance?

08:36.641 --> 08:37.559
No, it--

08:37.642 --> 08:38.935
The cheese stands alone,

08:39.019 --> 08:41.938
but no woman should stand alone,
when standing up to sexual harassment?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.773
-Squawk!
-No, it wasn't any of those things!

08:43.857 --> 08:47.193
So, you're saying it wasn't any<i> one </i>thing,
more of an accumulation?

08:47.277 --> 08:49.320
-It--
-BoJack, it is really incredible,

08:49.404 --> 08:51.072
your taking a stand against your co-star.

08:51.156 --> 08:54.784
-No, I'm not taking any stand--
-I mean, the guy choked his wife,

08:54.868 --> 08:57.787
and most of Hollywoo is, like,
"No biggie. Good for him!"

08:57.871 --> 09:00.915
-Squawk!
-Okay, well, obviously it's not good

09:00.999 --> 09:02.000
he choked his wife.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.501
-Wow!
-[cheering, applause]

09:03.585 --> 09:06.588
No, no, no! I wasn't trying to make
some bold statement or anything.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.923
It's just that...
choking your wife is bad.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.592
[cheering and applauding]

09:11.342 --> 09:12.343
Really?

09:13.678 --> 09:14.512
Okay.

09:14.596 --> 09:19.517
Can I just tell you how amazing it is
to hear a <i>man </i>say that?

09:19.601 --> 09:22.228
Well, Paloma,
someone needed to take a stand.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.730
[cheering and applauding]

09:24.189 --> 09:27.525
Call me crazy. I mean,
this is just old BoJack talking,

09:27.609 --> 09:30.904
-but how about we don't choke <i>any </i>women?
-[cheering]

09:30.987 --> 09:34.866
So true, right? Don't choke women!

09:34.949 --> 09:37.077
[all chanting] Don't choke women!

09:37.160 --> 09:38.286
BoJack is right.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.455
Hollywoo shouldn't legitimize abusers,

09:40.538 --> 09:43.083
by allowing them to star
in movies and TV shows,

09:43.166 --> 09:45.627
that play off their problematic personas!

09:45.710 --> 09:47.962
[audience] Hollywoo
shouldn't legitimize abusers

09:48.046 --> 09:50.673
by allowing them to star
in movies and TV shows

09:50.757 --> 09:53.635
that play off
their problematic personas!

09:54.260 --> 09:55.845
-All right!
-Squawk!

09:55.929 --> 09:57.722
And speaking
of battering women,

09:57.806 --> 10:01.643
right after the break, we'll show you
how to make the perfect blueberry pancake.

10:01.726 --> 10:05.605
-With proud feminist, BoJack Horseman.
-Stick around!

10:05.688 --> 10:07.649
And don't choke women! [chuckles]

10:08.608 --> 10:09.484
[signal buzzes]

10:10.110 --> 10:13.446
How is it you consistently do the opposite
of the thing I need you to do?

10:13.530 --> 10:14.948
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.908
Is it possible, this whole time,

10:16.991 --> 10:19.869
I've been an amazing feminist hero,
and nobody knew it?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.538
-BoJack!
-Feels pretty right.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.499
Yeah, I'm a male feminist.
You're welcome, society.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.251
-I gotta call Vance.
-Okay.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.837
I'm just gonna stay here, being woke.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.965
Vance! Listen,
BoJack's been very dehydrated.

10:32.048 --> 10:36.052
No, no, no. You can't use the old
"dehydration made him stupid" trick on me.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.222
Okay?
I'm Mr. Dehydration-Made-Me-Stupid.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.683
BoJack really wants to work with you.
He just got caught up--

10:41.766 --> 10:43.309
Doesn't matter.
I'm not doing the show.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.352
<i>-What?</i>
-You were right.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.687
All it took was one offer.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.940
Once word got out I was doing<i> Philbert,</i>
all the other offers started pouring in.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.275
You signed a contract!

10:50.358 --> 10:53.945
Oh, please. I sexted a 12-year-old
and still got a Humanitas Prize.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.781
You think I can't get out of a contract,
with a time website?

10:56.865 --> 10:59.826
By the way, still very sorry
about sexting that 12-year-old.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.369
[groans] Oh-hh!

11:01.661 --> 11:04.414
Hey, Princess Carolyn,
you ever notice how, as a woman,

11:04.497 --> 11:07.292
you only make ten cents
for every dollar your clients make?

11:07.375 --> 11:11.421
-Really makes you think, huh?
-BoJack, I was wrong, you were right.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.673
Let's take that asshole down.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.593
So, <i>now, </i>you wanna take him down

11:16.676 --> 11:18.553
Now, that he's not doing
your TV show, anymore?

11:18.636 --> 11:19.762
Diane, don't be cynical.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.723
-<i>I'm </i>cynical?
-What do you want me to say?

11:21.806 --> 11:24.392
I got blinded by my desire
to see myself succeed,

11:24.475 --> 11:27.395
which, since I'm a woman,
is actually very feminist.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.522
But now that Vance can't help me succeed,

11:29.606 --> 11:34.027
I realize the more feminist thing to do
is to make sure <i>he</i> doesn't succeed either.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.447
-<i>I'm </i>cynical?
-I'm offering an olive branch, here.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.617
Look, this town loves assholes like Vance.
There's nothing we can do.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.286
This town is as wishy-washy
as a virgin on prom night.

11:43.369 --> 11:47.540
All they need to listen to women
is the right voice-- a <i>man's </i>voice.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.334
[BoJack] Oh!

11:49.751 --> 11:52.212
-Is that why I'm here?
-Yep. I brought you two together

11:52.295 --> 11:55.632
because between your feminist brain
and your stupid manly face,

11:55.715 --> 11:58.092
you can actually say things
that people will listen to.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.345
That's a good point.
People do listen to me all the time.

12:00.428 --> 12:04.224
One time I tweeted "RIP David Bowie,"
and now everyone still thinks he's dead.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.768
-David Bowie <i>is </i>dead.
-Wait, for real? Oh, man.

12:06.851 --> 12:11.564
So, through BoJack, I can say
whatever I want, to a huge audience,

12:11.648 --> 12:15.860
without being called "shrill,"
or "naggy," or "classic Diane."

12:15.944 --> 12:17.820
Yeah. Everyone loves a male feminist.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.281
It turns out, the problem
with feminism, all along,

12:20.365 --> 12:22.033
is it just wasn't men doing it.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.451
We're much less shrill.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.287
Yeah, this is truly a great day
for women everywhere.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.539
[rock music playing]

12:29.999 --> 12:32.293
Okay, how do I make people think
I'm a tough bad boy,

12:32.377 --> 12:34.754
who doesn't give a care
about society's precious rules?

12:34.837 --> 12:37.632
Every time Vance Waggoner
breaks the rules,

12:37.715 --> 12:39.968
-it gets caught on camera.
-That's it!

12:40.051 --> 12:42.720
We just need some video evidence
of me being tough!

12:42.804 --> 12:44.222
Here, record this.

12:44.514 --> 12:45.473
Ooooh!

12:45.556 --> 12:47.600
-[phone camera beeps]
-[exhales]

12:47.767 --> 12:50.144
<i>-Hey, got one for me, toughie?</i>
<i>-Sorry, bud.</i>

12:50.228 --> 12:51.604
<i>Not yet, you're not.</i>

12:51.688 --> 12:54.524
<i>But you can bet your candy ass</i>
<i>you're gonna be.</i>

12:54.607 --> 12:56.651
-[Todd] Ooh!
-[stammers] <i>What the--?</i>

12:56.734 --> 12:58.403
What do you say to that?

12:59.487 --> 13:02.323
<i>-Thank you. So much.</i>
<i>-Huh?</i>

13:02.782 --> 13:05.910
<i>Two weeks ago, we buried my father.</i>
<i>Lung cancer.</i>

13:05.994 --> 13:08.371
<i>My baby girl made me promise</i>
<i>I'd quit smoking,</i>

13:08.454 --> 13:12.083
<i>but I've been sneaking</i>
<i>these suicide sticks this entire time.</i>

13:12.166 --> 13:14.585
<i>No more. That was my last cigarette.</i>

13:14.752 --> 13:18.047
-[sweet melody music]
-<i>Thank you, you sweet, sweet soul.</i>

13:18.506 --> 13:19.424
<i>Mm-wah!</i>

13:19.716 --> 13:23.553
<i>You are truly a kind</i>
<i>and approachable character.</i>

13:23.636 --> 13:25.972
<i>And tough?</i>

13:26.055 --> 13:29.058
<i>Tough not to love, you big galoot!</i>

13:29.142 --> 13:30.727
<i>-Oh, banana bread!</i>
-[phone camera beeps]

13:31.853 --> 13:35.023
-Okay, just...
-[marker squeaking]

13:35.106 --> 13:39.110
[sighs] Okay, so, pop culture
inherently normalizes things,

13:39.193 --> 13:40.987
and that power works both ways.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.613
<i>It can normalize things for good,</i>

13:42.697 --> 13:45.908
<i>like how dancing Ellen makes</i>
<i>middle America less afraid of gay people.</i>

13:45.992 --> 13:47.910
<i>But it can also normalize things</i>
<i>for bad,</i>

13:47.994 --> 13:51.831
<i>like what Jack Bauer did for torture,</i>
<i>or what Jimmy Fallon did for lip-syncing.</i>

13:52.123 --> 13:55.376
So, when we give a platform
to known abusers like Vance Waggoner,

13:55.460 --> 13:57.628
that's an example of...?

13:59.255 --> 14:01.758
Normalizing things for...?

14:04.052 --> 14:06.220
-Good or bad?
-I'm sorry.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.556
I know you're trying really hard
not to be boring,

14:08.639 --> 14:10.725
and it's kind of not boring,

14:10.808 --> 14:13.478
but it still mostly feels
like I'm being lectured at.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.687
-Okay, well--
-Hold on.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.982
Let me imagine that I'm saying it.
You know what, that's a little better.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.193
Well, the bar for men is depressingly low.

14:20.276 --> 14:24.197
Just sprinkle in a few words like
"intersectionality" or "micro-aggressions"

14:24.280 --> 14:26.783
and<i> Vice News </i>will name you
Feminist of the Year.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.993
Oh, should I wear a T-shirt
that says "Feminism is Bae"?

14:29.077 --> 14:30.495
Girls love shit like that, right?

14:30.578 --> 14:32.663
[sighs] Sounds great, BoJack.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.085
[door closes]

14:38.503 --> 14:41.381
-Hello, Diane.
-[yelps] How did you get in my car?

14:41.464 --> 14:44.300
-You left it unlocked.
-It's a Prius. It locks automatically.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.386
Priuses<i> unlock</i> automatically.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.596
You still need to lock it
when you get out.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.015
-Really?
-I know you and your little Scooby gang

14:51.099 --> 14:54.852
are plotting something against my client,
and I want you to stop.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.481
Ugh! Of course that dirtbag
would hire Ana Spanakopita.

14:58.564 --> 15:02.360
Vance has a troubled past.
All he's asking for is a fresh start.

15:02.443 --> 15:06.155
-No. Why does he get that over and over?
-He's reformed.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.615
What else would you have him do?

15:07.698 --> 15:10.743
Let's say, you can make him do
anything you want to make things right.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.622
What would you make
Vance Waggoner do, now?

15:15.581 --> 15:18.126
Nothing.
I don't think he can make things right.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.545
Well, then, what do you hope
to accomplish, here?

15:20.628 --> 15:21.796
Can't you just admit to me,

15:21.879 --> 15:24.674
just between the two of us,
that this sucks?

15:24.757 --> 15:28.302
You can say it's your job, that you
believe in "forgiveness," whatever,

15:28.386 --> 15:30.430
but don't you at least a little bit think

15:30.513 --> 15:32.348
that when we let guys
like Vance off the hook...

15:32.432 --> 15:34.809
-Diane.
-...when you, as a woman,

15:34.892 --> 15:37.019
give awful men
the cover of your friendship,

15:37.103 --> 15:39.105
when you work for them.
First of all,

15:39.188 --> 15:42.150
they're not gonna get better.
Second of all, you are then complicit...

15:42.233 --> 15:46.195
no, you're culpable
for the terrible things they do.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.488
Are you done?

15:47.572 --> 15:52.285
Just, woman to woman,
can't you admit this is screwed up?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.455
You've given me a lot to think about.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.293
-[walking away]
-[remote chirps, lock clicks]

16:00.376 --> 16:01.961
Oh...!

16:02.962 --> 16:05.798
So, in conclusion,
is Smurfette a feminist icon?

16:05.882 --> 16:08.718
I think the better question is,
why does she have to be?,

16:08.801 --> 16:12.054
We've gotten a little off track, here.
We were talking about Vance Waggoner.

16:12.138 --> 16:12.972
Oh, yeah!

16:13.055 --> 16:16.100
We actually have a tape of a press
conference Vance gave, earlier today.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.518
-What?
-And he mentioned you in it.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.353
Oh, no, is this a<i> Gotcha?</i>
Am I the gotcha?

16:19.437 --> 16:20.771
Let's see what he had to say.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.441
I have an important announcement.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.068
-I... am a feminist, too.
-[applause]

16:26.152 --> 16:31.657
That's why I had to walk away
from BoJack Horseman's new show<i> Philbert.</i>

16:31.741 --> 16:34.619
Okay, I read the scripts they sent me,
and I was outraged.

16:34.702 --> 16:38.748
Gratuitous sexual violence.
Protracted, lascivious nude scenes.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.001
Maybe BoJack Horseman thinks
that's all in good fun,

16:42.084 --> 16:43.294
but I know it's toxic.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.838
And if I took part in it,
I would be complicit--

16:45.922 --> 16:48.841
no, culpable for that toxicity.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.260
BoJack, what do you say to those charges?

16:51.344 --> 16:52.428
Um...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.222
The future is female?

16:58.059 --> 16:58.893
[chuckles]

17:00.186 --> 17:01.938
Pretty cool, huh?

17:02.313 --> 17:06.025
-Uh, are you sure about this outfit?
-All the toughest guys wear leather.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.820
Biker gangs, motorcycle cops,
non-heteronormative dominatrices.

17:09.904 --> 17:14.367
Well, this is the sleaziest,
most dangerous dive bar in Hollywoo.

17:14.492 --> 17:19.622
It's where all the bad boys party.
Charlie Sheen, Chris Brown, Subway Jared.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.834
Great. I'll waltz right in, fight
a few bouncers, throw a drink in a face,

17:23.918 --> 17:27.588
and get this menacing mug
on the cover of a few tabloids.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.341
-Hey.
-[Peanutbutter] Hey! Bird brains!

17:30.424 --> 17:33.302
Why don't you snap
some pics of me being mean?

17:33.386 --> 17:37.181
Get the word out
that I'm a real tough SOAB!

17:37.265 --> 17:39.725
-You? Tough? Yeah, right!
-Hah!

17:39.809 --> 17:45.022
I've seen tougher guys at the fancy-boy
bubble bath parties I sometimes attend.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.400
-What?
-Sorry, I can't invite ya.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.277
Fancy boys only.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.196
-Well, you two have a pleasant afternoon.
-No, Mr. Peanutbutter.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.658
-Show 'em your tough stuff!
-Oh, yeah!

17:55.825 --> 17:57.034
[growls]

17:57.910 --> 17:59.620
-[barks]
-[birds yelp]

17:59.870 --> 18:01.205
Oh, my God, are you guys okay?

18:01.747 --> 18:03.749
-Did you hear that?
-No.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.918
Exactly. No more clicking.

18:06.002 --> 18:10.089
You fixed my TMJ, which means
no more wearing a night guard to bed.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.051
Wow, I already feel like a more confident
and assertive lover.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.595
Thanks, Mr. Peanutbutter.

18:15.678 --> 18:20.641
I'm gonna go home
and make love to my <i>wiiiiiiiiiiiiife!</i>

18:20.725 --> 18:21.559
Uh...

18:22.018 --> 18:24.770
My crossed eye. It-- it's fixed!

18:24.854 --> 18:27.440
My depth perception
is so much better now.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.400
I'm gonna go watch a Wes Anderson movie

18:29.483 --> 18:32.945
and see if I can perceive
any depth in <i>iiiiiiiiiiit!</i>

18:34.196 --> 18:36.365
And stay out!

18:39.410 --> 18:40.244
Whoa.

18:40.328 --> 18:44.081
-So... did Philbert kill his wife?
-Well, Sassy thinks so.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.125
That's why she's pretending
to be his new partner,

18:46.208 --> 18:47.418
to get closer to the truth.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.545
Meanwhile, his old partner Fritz
is back in the mix,

18:49.629 --> 18:51.422
but he might be dead
and just a projection

18:51.505 --> 18:54.175
-of Philbert's lingering guilt.
-Ooooh!

18:54.508 --> 18:57.011
-That's very unclear.
-Yeah, the whole thing's nonsense,

18:57.094 --> 19:00.389
but, more importantly,
how do we prove it's not sexist?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.849
-It is sexist.
-No, of course.

19:01.932 --> 19:05.102
But right now, I have to do an interview
where I explain that it's not,

19:05.186 --> 19:07.271
because otherwise,
I'll look like a hypocrite,

19:07.355 --> 19:09.690
which would be really bad
for women everywhere.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.318
So, in order to save feminism,

19:12.401 --> 19:14.320
you need to give me
some smart-sounding reasons

19:14.403 --> 19:17.198
why Philbert
isn't what it so obviously is,

19:17.281 --> 19:20.326
so that I can continue to be a hero
and role model.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.536
Everything Vance said
about these scripts is true.

19:22.620 --> 19:26.165
It's posing as a deconstruction
of the edifice of toxic masculinity...

19:26.248 --> 19:27.917
Uh-huh. Toxic masculinity, yeah. Right.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.171
But it's just using that, as an excuse
to relish in its own excesses.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.299
And the most depressing thing...
is that ten times more people

19:35.383 --> 19:38.135
are gonna watch this show
than read anything I've ever written.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.429
I feel you're not really getting
into the spirit here.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.349
We can still take down Vance
and topple the patriarchy.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.227
Come on, we're doing feminism,
it's supposed to be fun!

19:46.310 --> 19:47.603
This isn't fun for me!

19:47.687 --> 19:51.357
Being a woman is not a hobby
or a pet interest of mine.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.694
You get to drop in, and play Joss Whedon,
and everybody cheers.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.655
But when you move on
to your next thing, I'm still here.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.032
Okay, yeah, I totally get that.
But in the meantime,

20:00.116 --> 20:02.076
I just need to know what to say
about this show.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.328
Say whatever you want.
I have a listicle to write.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.831
So, unless you can give me
"five times Rihanna gave us life,"

20:06.914 --> 20:08.374
this conversation is over.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.505
BoJack Horseman
is our<i> Deep Dive</i> guest, today.

20:14.588 --> 20:18.050
So, what's going on?
Something about your show being sexist?

20:18.134 --> 20:21.345
My producer printed out an article
for me, but I did not read it.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.723
Look, obviously,
when you take plot points out of context,

20:23.806 --> 20:24.890
they can seem unsavory.

20:24.974 --> 20:30.146
But they're all part of a larger attempt
to deconstruct... toxic... masculinity.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.148
Ooh! Sounds glamorous!

20:32.231 --> 20:34.358
No, we're not glamorizing it,
that's the thing.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.778
You're not supposed to like John Philbert
or agree with the things he does.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.197
It's a TV show.
It doesn't glamorize anything.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.284
But... maybe it normalizes it.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.035
I gotta go.

20:45.619 --> 20:51.167
Okay. We still have 48 minutes,
so, I guess <i>I </i>should just talk?

20:51.375 --> 20:53.252
-[clicks]
-I was eight years old

20:53.335 --> 20:55.796
when my father
first showed me his scars.

20:55.880 --> 21:00.551
Each scar... tells a story,
and every story... leaves a scar.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.220
[tires screech]

21:03.971 --> 21:06.474
-[yelps] Holy crap!
-Diane, the show needs your help.

21:06.557 --> 21:07.725
-What?
-You were right.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.352
It's all the things you said it is,
but it doesn't have to be.

21:10.519 --> 21:14.106
Come on as a consulting producer.
Work with Flip on the scripts,

21:14.190 --> 21:16.358
make the show something
that we can all be proud of.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.651
Why would I do that?

21:17.735 --> 21:20.154
You said it yourself, more people
are going to watch this show

21:20.237 --> 21:21.697
than read anything you write.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.825
I'm giving you the opportunity
to change society for the better.

21:24.909 --> 21:28.871
-Nothing I do changes anything.
-No? You changed me.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.459
[yelling, whooping]

21:35.586 --> 21:36.629
Listen up, scum.

21:36.712 --> 21:37.546
-[yelling stops]
-Huh?

21:37.630 --> 21:40.174
-[woman grunts]
-There's a new sheriff in town.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.384
-And his name is...
-Trace Norcutt.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.095
Yeah, I read about him this morning
in the metro section.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.264
He just won a special election, right?

21:47.348 --> 21:49.600
-Maybe so, but I--
-[bartender] Wow!

21:49.683 --> 21:51.644
Thank you, sir, for keeping us informed

21:51.727 --> 21:54.772
about the comings and goings
of our city politic.

21:54.855 --> 21:59.401
After all, a democracy is only as strong
as its populace is informed.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.986
No, no, no, I was trying to--

22:01.070 --> 22:03.864
Hey, let's cheer once
for this kind stranger!

22:03.948 --> 22:06.367
-Hip! Hip!
-[patrons] Hurray!

22:07.201 --> 22:11.413
I guess Princess Carolyn was right.
Huh, Todd? Todd?

22:11.497 --> 22:15.209
So, I guess the toughest thing of all
was being tough.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.794
-Who are you talking to?
-Estelle.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.421
-Who's Estelle?
-Just Estelle. You don't know her.

22:19.505 --> 22:22.132
Not everybody needs to know everybody.

22:22.216 --> 22:25.135
Hmm. I have learned two lessons, today.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.306
We still need to cast Philbert's partner.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.351
No more bad boys.
We can't take another PR hit.

22:32.434 --> 22:36.438
We need an actor who everybody loves.
Someone almost annoyingly positive.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.358
Enthusiastic with zero baggage.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.443
[phone beeping, meowing]

22:41.819 --> 22:44.196
You know who would be perfect?

22:44.738 --> 22:46.574
Uh...

22:47.116 --> 22:49.076
Hey, Flip! Diane.

22:49.159 --> 22:52.454
Yeah, you're the lady who's gonna make
my show less sexist, right?

22:52.538 --> 22:55.249
-Well, I'll see what I can do.
-Here's what I need.

22:55.332 --> 22:59.420
Sit in my office, don't chew too loud,
and collect your paycheck.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.880
Then, when the show comes out,

23:00.963 --> 23:03.048
people will see your name
in the credits and say,

23:03.132 --> 23:07.011
"Huh, a lady worked on the show.
Guess it's not sexist."

23:07.094 --> 23:09.847
-I can contribute more than that.
-Not necessary.

23:09.930 --> 23:14.143
Hey, thanks for being here.
You're really making a difference.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.978
Uh...

23:20.065 --> 23:21.108
[door closes]

23:22.026 --> 23:24.320
-Hello, Diane.
-[shouts] Jesus Christ!

23:24.403 --> 23:25.821
I locked the doors this time!

23:25.905 --> 23:28.699
I broke your window,
because I needed to talk to you.

23:28.782 --> 23:31.827
-I have a phone!
-You were right about Vance.

23:31.911 --> 23:35.831
He just got fired off his new movie
after a drunken rant about the Chinese,

23:35.915 --> 23:39.752
and then plowed his Hummer into the side
of the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.422
-Not the... Chinese Theatre?
-Mhm.

23:43.505 --> 23:47.384
Anyway, his career is over,
for about two or three years,

23:47.468 --> 23:49.178
-and then he'll be fine again.
-Yeah.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.932
Listen, I'm sorry, the last time I saw you
I made things kind of personal.

23:53.015 --> 23:56.101
No, no. You were right.
We give these men cover.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.436
And if we give them cover,

23:57.519 --> 23:59.605
we should know
exactly what they're capable of.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.566
In fact,
I wanted to share this with you...

24:02.650 --> 24:04.777
-woman to woman.
-[clicks]

24:05.152 --> 24:07.655
[BoJack's voice] <i>She just walked in</i>
<i>at the worst possible...</i>

24:07.905 --> 24:11.283
<i>-It wasn't my fault... right?</i>
-What is this?

24:11.367 --> 24:13.744
<i>-[woman] ...what you're talking about.</i>
-[BoJack] <i>On the boat.</i>

24:13.827 --> 24:15.120
<i>There was a girl.</i>

24:15.454 --> 24:17.414
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-In New Mexico.</i>

24:18.082 --> 24:20.125
<i>-And she trusted me.</i>
-Wha...?

24:20.209 --> 24:21.585
<i>I keep asking myself,</i>

24:21.669 --> 24:24.588
<i>if her mother didn't walk in,</i>
<i>would I have done it?</i>

24:24.672 --> 24:27.341
<i>And part of me is sure</i>
<i>that I... I couldn't.</i>

24:28.842 --> 24:31.178
<i>But another part knows that's a lie.</i>

24:32.137 --> 24:33.097
<i>How do you make it right</i>

24:33.180 --> 24:35.474
<i>when you've made it so wrong,</i>
<i>you can never go back?</i>

24:39.395 --> 24:41.730
[music playing]
