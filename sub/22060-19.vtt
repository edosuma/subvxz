WEBVTT

00:05.266 --> 00:07.701
So you'll get a ride home
from your buddy after school?

00:07.703 --> 00:09.202
Probably gonna end up
taking the bus.

00:09.204 --> 00:11.004
Mr. Brentmiller wants to meet
with me about something.

00:11.006 --> 00:13.173
Why? What'd you do wrong now?

00:13.175 --> 00:15.609
Nothing.
You must have done something wrong.

00:15.611 --> 00:17.678
You got called down to
the principal's office.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.347
It's for some dumb essay
Mom made me write last spring.

00:20.349 --> 00:22.082
- Put bad words in it?
- No.

00:22.084 --> 00:25.052
- Did you write something dirty?
- No. God.

00:25.054 --> 00:26.920
Well, what'd you do
wrong in the essay?

00:26.922 --> 00:28.889
You got called down
to the office about it.

00:28.891 --> 00:30.757
I actually won.

00:32.192 --> 00:33.527
Well, that's great.

00:33.529 --> 00:35.295
- No, it's not.
- Why not?

00:35.297 --> 00:37.331
Because now,
Mr. Brentmiller wants me

00:37.333 --> 00:40.167
to go to some ceremony,
and I just don't want to go.

00:40.169 --> 00:41.568
Well, that's your choice,

00:41.570 --> 00:43.170
but not for nothing,
if it was up to me...

00:43.172 --> 00:46.206
Yeah, I'm actually gonna pass.

00:46.208 --> 00:49.443
Okay. Don't go.

00:55.883 --> 00:58.051
$220,000.

00:58.053 --> 01:00.153
Well, their position is,
we got off cheap.

01:00.155 --> 01:01.922
Though our detective
did nothing wrong.

01:01.924 --> 01:03.557
- Which makes this highway robbery.
- I'm not sure

01:03.559 --> 01:04.491
that crime's
on the books anymore.

01:04.515 --> 01:05.593
You check?

01:05.594 --> 01:08.161
- 'Cause it ought to be... or extortion.
- I'll check.

01:08.163 --> 01:09.997
Look, this was due process,
okay?

01:09.999 --> 01:11.365
The corporation counsel's

01:11.367 --> 01:13.066
office claims the CCRB

01:13.068 --> 01:15.202
found enough evidence
of excessive force

01:15.204 --> 01:16.737
to justify a settlement.

01:16.739 --> 01:18.905
The mutt claims he was thrown
down the stairs,

01:18.907 --> 01:21.241
when in fact, he was
being chased for selling drugs

01:21.243 --> 01:22.609
and fell down those stairs.

01:22.611 --> 01:24.111
CCRB didn't see it that way.

01:24.113 --> 01:25.512
They chose not to.

01:25.514 --> 01:26.913
I'm not privy to that process.

01:26.915 --> 01:29.116
I know of no actual policy

01:29.118 --> 01:31.518
to roll over
on this kind of lawsuit.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.653
Not actual, more like unspoken.

01:33.655 --> 01:35.188
They're scared
of big dollar judgments

01:35.190 --> 01:36.890
and the bad press
that comes with them.

01:36.892 --> 01:38.425
They'd rather just fold
at lower numbers.

01:38.427 --> 01:40.260
Who they're folding
on? Our cops.

01:40.262 --> 01:41.928
Sid, maybe just once,
you could take off

01:41.930 --> 01:43.096
those blue colored glasses.

01:43.098 --> 01:45.265
Come on, Garrett, Sid's right.

01:45.267 --> 01:46.900
It looks like we're paying off
these perps

01:46.902 --> 01:49.002
to avoid a hearing
in open court.

01:49.004 --> 01:51.204
- Thank you.
- And factoring lawsuits

01:51.206 --> 01:54.841
into split-second decisions
doesn't make for safer cops.

01:54.843 --> 01:56.309
So what do you want to do?

01:56.311 --> 01:58.445
Not that I'm sure there's
anything you can do.

01:58.447 --> 02:01.081
- Push back.
- On who? The mayor?

02:01.083 --> 02:03.316
Somehow I don't think

02:03.318 --> 02:06.086
the mayor's engaged
on this issue.

02:06.088 --> 02:07.788
How do you know?

02:07.790 --> 02:09.789
I just know.

02:09.792 --> 02:12.059
Then who?

02:12.061 --> 02:14.261
Kelly Peterson.

02:22.737 --> 02:24.204
What do we got?

02:24.206 --> 02:25.605
This is Mrs. Cardinelli.

02:25.607 --> 02:27.974
Says her neighbors' 13-year-old
daughter's gone missing.

02:27.976 --> 02:29.409
Her name is Emily Bennett.

02:29.411 --> 02:31.178
I look in on her when
her parents are at work.

02:31.180 --> 02:32.546
You have a key to
the Bennett's apartment, ma'am?

02:32.548 --> 02:33.747
Yes.

02:36.651 --> 02:39.686
Diane and Ryan leave
for work at around 8:00.

02:39.688 --> 02:43.056
When I looked in on Emily at
around 10:00, she wasn't here.

02:43.058 --> 02:45.592
She's 13 years old... how come
she's not in school today?

02:45.594 --> 02:46.893
She just had surgery.

02:46.895 --> 02:48.228
What kind of surgery?

02:48.230 --> 02:49.262
A heart transplant.

02:49.264 --> 02:51.832
Mr. and Mrs. Bennett?

02:51.834 --> 02:53.834
We left as soon as we got
Norma's call. Thank you.

02:53.836 --> 02:55.836
Would you wait outside with
the officer, please, ma'am?

02:55.838 --> 02:58.438
Emily had congestive
heart failure.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.308
She received a donor heart
ten days ago.

03:01.310 --> 03:04.377
Is it possible she just
went for a walk or something?

03:04.379 --> 03:05.412
She's not strong enough
for that yet.

03:05.414 --> 03:07.214
Shouldn't she be
in the hospital?

03:07.216 --> 03:08.748
In a sane world, yes.

03:08.750 --> 03:12.018
E-Emily's on a strict regimen
of medication and bed rest.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.520
Unfortunately, our insurance

03:13.522 --> 03:15.122
won't cover that,
or a rehab hospital,

03:15.124 --> 03:16.556
but the doctors said it was okay

03:16.558 --> 03:18.458
if she recovered here,
so long as she stays

03:18.460 --> 03:19.993
on her anti-rejection meds.

03:19.995 --> 03:23.497
All right. Don't touch
anything, sir, please.

03:25.566 --> 03:27.000
She didn't take her pills
this morning.

03:27.002 --> 03:28.368
And she didn't take any pills
with her.

03:28.370 --> 03:29.803
My God.

03:29.805 --> 03:32.038
What happens if she doesn't
take her pills?

03:32.040 --> 03:33.540
Once Emily's off her meds,

03:33.542 --> 03:35.509
her body will start rejecting
the donor heart.

03:35.511 --> 03:37.511
After 72 hours,

03:37.513 --> 03:39.880
the rejection
becomes irreversible.

03:39.882 --> 03:43.183
And sh-she could die.

03:43.185 --> 03:45.152
- It's okay. No, she's gonna be okay.
- No, no, no, no.

03:45.154 --> 03:47.387
- She's gonna be okay.
- No, no, no, no.

03:47.389 --> 03:50.223
No, no, no, no, no.
She's gonna be okay.

03:50.225 --> 03:51.625
It's okay. It's okay. No, no.

03:51.627 --> 03:53.426
You're gonna be okay.

03:54.629 --> 03:56.963
I'm just saying,
it's kind of boring.

03:56.965 --> 03:59.032
Baseball is boring? Seriously?

03:59.034 --> 04:00.667
Yeah. The games are,
like, nine hours long,

04:00.669 --> 04:02.035
and nothing actually happens.

04:02.037 --> 04:03.837
Baseball's a metaphor
for life, Eddie.

04:03.839 --> 04:05.605
Yeah, and I'm not gonna
spend mine watching a bunch

04:05.607 --> 04:06.940
of grown men in pajamas
coming up with new

04:06.942 --> 04:08.375
and exciting ways to scratch their...

04:08.377 --> 04:11.711
- Hey! Hey!
- Whoa. Hey!

04:11.713 --> 04:13.847
There's a car seat
in that car, Jamie.

04:13.849 --> 04:15.549
Was there a kid in it?!

04:15.551 --> 04:17.083
I don't know.

04:17.084 --> 04:18.652
I'm not sure.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:30.798 --> 04:32.332
Police! Don't move! Don't move!
Let me see your hands!

04:32.334 --> 04:34.234
- Let me see your hands!
- Put your hands where I can see 'em!

04:34.236 --> 04:35.468
Don't move!

04:35.470 --> 04:37.504
Put your hands where
I can see 'em! Don't move.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.941
There's no kid, Jamie,
there's no kid.

04:40.943 --> 04:41.975
What?

04:41.977 --> 04:43.276
There's no kid.

04:45.247 --> 04:47.347
Hey, there's a gun on the seat.
Get his gun.

04:47.349 --> 04:48.548
I got it. I got it.

04:53.188 --> 04:55.956
Get back! Everybody stay back!

04:55.958 --> 04:59.125
- Are you okay? You okay?
- My-my...

04:59.127 --> 05:01.595
My son. My s-son. My...

05:01.597 --> 05:03.697
All right. Stay put. Stay put.

05:03.699 --> 05:04.764
Eddie!

05:04.766 --> 05:05.799
Put your phone down.

05:05.801 --> 05:07.321
Put your phone down.
Everyone, back up!

05:10.805 --> 05:13.440
Hey. Hey, hey, bud.
You okay? You okay in there?

05:14.643 --> 05:17.344
Okay. Eddie. Central, 12-David,

05:17.346 --> 05:18.979
I need a bus to this location.

05:18.981 --> 05:20.647
Motor vehicle accident.

05:20.649 --> 05:22.115
I got one adult semi-conscious,

05:22.117 --> 05:23.750
and a youth approximately
seven years of age

05:23.752 --> 05:27.320
unconscious at this time.

05:27.322 --> 05:29.623
Put a rush on it.

06:00.311 --> 06:01.273
What did the doctor say?

06:01.274 --> 06:03.274
Too early to tell... they're
calling in a neurosurgeon.

06:03.276 --> 06:04.743
This is not good.

06:04.745 --> 06:05.777
Andrew!

06:05.779 --> 06:06.978
Andrew?

06:06.980 --> 06:08.179
Where's my son?

06:08.181 --> 06:09.748
They're taking him into surgery.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.249
Is-is he gonna be okay?

06:11.251 --> 06:13.585
This is one of the best
trauma hospitals in the city.

06:14.954 --> 06:17.322
This isn't your fault,
Mr. Price.

06:17.324 --> 06:19.390
You're right.

06:19.392 --> 06:20.658
It's your fault.

06:20.660 --> 06:22.393
If you hadn't been chasing

06:22.395 --> 06:24.729
that guy, he never would have
plowed into us.

06:24.731 --> 06:26.698
We never meant for anything
like this to happen.

06:26.700 --> 06:29.534
But it did happen!

06:34.406 --> 06:35.607
He's right.

06:35.609 --> 06:38.476
This is on us.

06:38.478 --> 06:39.911
Eddie, this was an accident.

06:39.913 --> 06:42.947
The department has a policy
against high-speed chases

06:42.949 --> 06:44.449
for exactly this reason.

06:44.451 --> 06:46.851
Hey. Given the same
circumstances,

06:46.853 --> 06:48.486
would you have done
anything different?

06:50.891 --> 06:52.323
No.

06:52.325 --> 06:53.525
Me neither.

06:53.527 --> 06:56.294
Then why do I feel like
we screwed up?

07:14.680 --> 07:16.447
Hello, Frank.

07:16.449 --> 07:19.050
Thanks for coming, Kelly.

07:19.052 --> 07:20.151
Sorry I'm late.

07:20.153 --> 07:21.553
You remembered.

07:21.555 --> 07:23.288
Yes.

07:23.290 --> 07:25.957
Can't you do anything
about that midtown traffic?

07:25.959 --> 07:29.127
Well, I believe that
congestion pricing

07:29.129 --> 07:31.663
falls in your purview
more than mine.

07:31.665 --> 07:33.398
Well, the signs say a $150 fine

07:33.400 --> 07:34.699
and two points on your license

07:34.701 --> 07:35.967
for blocking the intersection,

07:35.969 --> 07:38.903
but how many of those tickets
do you actually give out?

07:38.905 --> 07:41.706
Clearly, not enough.

07:41.708 --> 07:43.808
Let's talk about
the settlements.

07:43.810 --> 07:47.645
So, the mayor kicked this over

07:47.647 --> 07:49.147
to the corporation counsel.

07:49.149 --> 07:52.450
Yes, this particular buck
stops with me.

07:52.452 --> 07:54.319
Our law department
has to weigh payout

07:54.321 --> 07:56.988
versus potential exposure
on a case-by-case basis.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.123
I appreciate that.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.659
And I appreciate that our policy

08:01.661 --> 08:05.363
of settling lawsuits
against the NYPD is...

08:05.365 --> 08:06.831
irritating to you.

08:06.833 --> 08:10.235
Irritating doesn't
begin to describe it.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.638
Pick your own adjective.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.941
Infuriating,
confounding, asinine.

08:16.943 --> 08:19.010
My cops are not perfect.

08:19.012 --> 08:22.013
When they screw up,
people get hurt,

08:22.015 --> 08:23.948
and the victims are
entitled to compensation.

08:23.950 --> 08:25.183
Yes, they are.

08:25.185 --> 08:27.619
But handing out big money

08:27.621 --> 08:29.888
just to make the
matter go away...

08:29.890 --> 08:31.990
It doesn't go away.

08:31.992 --> 08:34.225
It gets resolved the way
most disputes do.

08:34.227 --> 08:35.827
Nobody gets
everything they want.

08:35.828 --> 08:37.861
Some perps do. It's free money.

08:37.864 --> 08:40.631
Well, it's nickels
on the dollar.

08:40.634 --> 08:42.933
They're still free nickels.

08:42.936 --> 08:46.638
You make a point.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.740
But this isn't a debate,
it's a math class.

08:48.742 --> 08:51.542
And the right answer
is based solely

08:51.544 --> 08:53.378
on a correct reading
of the numbers.

08:53.380 --> 08:56.848
We're talking about lives and
reputations here, not numbers.

08:56.850 --> 09:01.219
But fighting lawsuits
against cops,

09:01.221 --> 09:06.424
when the public is focused on
excessive force by the NYPD,

09:06.426 --> 09:08.593
is financially risky.

09:08.595 --> 09:10.762
Maybe the public is
focused on it because

09:10.764 --> 09:13.498
you keep validating
bogus claims.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.632
- Come on.
- No.

09:14.634 --> 09:16.000
It contributes to
a false narrative.

09:16.002 --> 09:18.836
I run the stats
with the comptroller.

09:18.838 --> 09:21.039
Avoiding litigation
is very often

09:21.041 --> 09:23.041
the most cost-effective
course of action.

09:23.043 --> 09:25.910
So, cost-effective
equals right and just?

09:25.912 --> 09:27.578
Since when?

09:27.580 --> 09:30.081
Okay...

09:30.083 --> 09:33.751
The 220 paid out
in the Staten Island case,

09:33.753 --> 09:35.954
maybe ten people took notice.

09:35.956 --> 09:37.822
But say that case went to trial,

09:37.824 --> 09:41.359
and the jury awarded
the $2.2 million.

09:41.361 --> 09:44.228
You and your cop have got
the front page.

09:47.533 --> 09:50.969
That's some wicked
spin right there.

09:55.774 --> 09:58.743
I broke a cardinal rule
of mine today.

09:58.745 --> 10:01.179
I usually eat before
one of our lunches

10:01.181 --> 10:04.849
because we so rarely make it
to the soup course.

10:04.851 --> 10:06.918
I'm very hungry.

10:21.433 --> 10:23.935
Any sign of Emily?

10:23.937 --> 10:25.803
We checked surveillance
footage from three cameras

10:25.805 --> 10:27.271
with an angle
on your front door.

10:27.273 --> 10:28.840
No sign of Emily
leaving this morning.

10:28.842 --> 10:30.274
We put out an AMBER Alert,

10:30.276 --> 10:31.909
and every cop in the city
is looking for her.

10:31.911 --> 10:33.745
Given Emily's health condition,

10:33.747 --> 10:36.047
she would have had to have had
help to get out of here, right?

10:36.049 --> 10:38.349
Do you have any idea
who would have helped her?

10:38.351 --> 10:40.651
No. Of course not.

10:40.653 --> 10:42.453
We got an emergency dump
on Emily's cell phone.

10:42.455 --> 10:44.355
Lists an 87-minute call
last night.

10:44.357 --> 10:45.890
Yeah, the number came back

10:45.892 --> 10:47.225
to an Evan Scott.

10:47.227 --> 10:49.260
You know who he is?

10:50.062 --> 10:51.896
That's Emily's boyfriend.

10:51.898 --> 10:53.865
Emily's boyfriend?

10:53.867 --> 10:55.633
Why the hell are we just
hearing about him now?

10:55.635 --> 10:58.569
We've tried to convince her
to end the relationship.

10:58.571 --> 11:00.304
How did Emily feel about that?

11:00.306 --> 11:03.474
She's a 13-year-old girl
in love for the first time.

11:03.476 --> 11:06.711
Do we have a picture
of this Evan Scott kid?

11:13.052 --> 11:14.585
That's him.

11:14.587 --> 11:16.721
Wait, I've seen this kid

11:16.723 --> 11:17.989
on the surveillance footage.

11:17.991 --> 11:19.857
- What?
- He was here this morning.

11:19.859 --> 11:22.126
Let's get this
picture out to patrol.

11:22.128 --> 11:24.495
Um, these two go
to the same school?

11:24.497 --> 11:26.064
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:26.066 --> 11:27.698
We'll find him.
We'll keep you updated.

11:31.070 --> 11:33.037
You wanted to see us, boss?

11:33.039 --> 11:35.239
Close the door.

11:38.410 --> 11:40.578
Collisions Investigation Squad

11:40.580 --> 11:42.213
has done
a preliminary investigation

11:42.215 --> 11:43.548
in the accident you caused.

11:43.550 --> 11:46.150
All due respect, we
didn't exactly cause it.

11:46.152 --> 11:48.786
We were pursuing
a possible kidnapping suspect.

11:48.788 --> 11:50.321
And a kid was seriously injured

11:50.323 --> 11:52.423
in a high-speed pursuit
you initiated.

11:52.425 --> 11:53.858
Who's responsible?

11:53.860 --> 11:55.626
What did CIS say, boss?

11:55.628 --> 11:58.963
The forensics indicate the perp
was traveling 60 miles an hour

11:58.965 --> 12:00.665
in a densely populated area.

12:00.667 --> 12:01.732
Which means
you were doing the same.

12:01.734 --> 12:03.234
Like Officer Janko stated,

12:03.236 --> 12:05.536
we believed that there was a kid
in the stolen car.

12:05.538 --> 12:07.271
But there wasn't.
And now a young boy

12:07.273 --> 12:08.606
is in the hospital,
and the department

12:08.608 --> 12:10.942
could face a major lawsuit.

12:14.180 --> 12:15.913
Pending the final results
of the investigation,

12:15.915 --> 12:18.216
you both are suspended
for 30 days.

12:19.284 --> 12:21.285
That's all.

12:23.922 --> 12:24.534
This way.

12:24.558 --> 12:26.391
You guys gonna tell me
what I did wrong?

12:26.392 --> 12:28.059
When's the last time
you saw Emily Bennett?

12:28.061 --> 12:30.761
- She wasn't in school today.
- That's not what he asked you.

12:30.763 --> 12:32.930
No, it isn't. Sit down.

12:33.732 --> 12:34.999
I don't know.

12:35.001 --> 12:36.367
Maybe a couple of days ago?

12:36.369 --> 12:38.236
That's funny,
'cause we got you on video

12:38.238 --> 12:40.938
standing outside her apartment
this morning, Romeo.

12:40.940 --> 12:43.174
Yeah, yeah, okay, I stopped by.

12:43.176 --> 12:44.475
So why did you lie?

12:44.477 --> 12:46.844
Emily's parents don't want us
seeing each other.

12:46.846 --> 12:48.312
But you went over there anyway.

12:48.314 --> 12:50.381
She was lonely, okay?

12:50.383 --> 12:52.817
She asked me to come over.

12:52.819 --> 12:54.552
Okay, so where's Emily now?

12:54.554 --> 12:55.953
What are you talking about?
She's at home.

12:55.955 --> 12:57.255
Look, we get that you care

12:57.257 --> 12:59.924
about Emily, but we need you
to tell us where she is.

12:59.926 --> 13:02.360
Are you saying
she's not at her apartment?

13:02.362 --> 13:04.095
She disappeared a few hours ago.

13:04.097 --> 13:05.396
And if you know
anything about it,

13:05.398 --> 13:07.298
now's the time to come clean.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.633
This is all my fault.

13:08.635 --> 13:10.101
What are you talking about?

13:10.103 --> 13:12.503
If-if I had stayed with her
this morning,

13:12.505 --> 13:14.772
she'd still be safe at home.

13:29.983 --> 13:30.696
Hey.

13:30.697 --> 13:31.933
Hey, Dad. Want some eggs?

13:31.934 --> 13:33.601
No time. Sorry, guys.

13:33.603 --> 13:35.803
I only got time for a shower.
I got to get back out.

13:35.805 --> 13:37.238
- You find that girl yet?
- Not yet.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.707
Hey. Did you hear? Your
brother's a famous writer now.

13:40.643 --> 13:41.876
It's really not that big
of a deal.

13:41.878 --> 13:43.043
Actually, it kind of is.

13:43.045 --> 13:46.013
I googled it. Over 900
entries across the city.

13:46.015 --> 13:47.815
Over 900 entries
across the city.

13:47.817 --> 13:49.416
You hear that?
You're a rock star.

13:49.418 --> 13:50.217
Dad...

13:50.219 --> 13:51.318
- It's true.
- I never won

13:51.320 --> 13:52.286
anything like that.

13:52.288 --> 13:53.420
I'm supposed to
be the smart one.

13:53.422 --> 13:54.722
Yeah. Supposed to be.

13:54.724 --> 13:56.257
You should really go
to the ceremony.

13:56.259 --> 13:57.291
No way. What do you mean,

13:57.293 --> 13:59.059
no way?
Mom would've wanted you to.

13:59.061 --> 14:00.094
Yeah.

14:00.096 --> 14:02.329
That's exactly my point.

14:02.331 --> 14:03.497
What's that supposed to mean?

14:03.499 --> 14:05.533
If I go, she's all
I'm gonna be thinking about.

14:05.535 --> 14:06.567
I'm gonna start crying

14:06.569 --> 14:08.169
and look like a huge jerk

14:08.171 --> 14:09.870
in front of everybody.

14:09.872 --> 14:11.105
What's wrong with that?

14:11.107 --> 14:13.207
I am not going.

14:16.645 --> 14:18.145
Sean.

14:21.216 --> 14:23.951
The boss was way out of line.

14:23.953 --> 14:26.220
Look at it from her perspective.
I am.

14:26.222 --> 14:27.721
Suspending us is an easy way

14:27.723 --> 14:29.523
to cover her ass
on a civilian injury.

14:29.525 --> 14:31.959
Guess she had to do something.
Well, how 'bout standing up

14:31.961 --> 14:33.460
for her officers?
Now we're taking a hit

14:33.462 --> 14:35.162
on an accident
that wasn't our fault.

14:35.164 --> 14:37.064
There's nothing
we can do about it.

14:37.066 --> 14:39.533
Actually, there is. We can fight
the charges in the trial room.

14:39.535 --> 14:41.669
That sounds
like a suicide mission.

14:41.671 --> 14:44.205
Eddie, cops fight the charges
in the trial room all the time.

14:44.207 --> 14:48.776
I'm not looking to damage
my career over this.

14:48.778 --> 14:50.444
Trust me,
a month-long suspension

14:50.446 --> 14:52.913
that makes it look like
we're the ones that screwed up

14:52.915 --> 14:54.782
will do a lot more damage.

14:56.251 --> 14:59.787
Unless we fight back.

15:03.124 --> 15:04.692
Hey.

15:04.694 --> 15:07.428
Hey. CSU find anything
at the apartment?

15:07.430 --> 15:09.797
No blood, no prints
other than the Bennetts,

15:09.799 --> 15:11.031
Evan, and the neighbor.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.399
No surprise.

15:12.401 --> 15:13.667
And the boyfriend's clean.

15:13.669 --> 15:15.069
There's no ransom demands.

15:15.071 --> 15:17.771
This girl's been missing over
24 hours, and we got nothing.

15:17.773 --> 15:19.073
We're missing something.

15:19.075 --> 15:20.641
Maybe we should re-canvass
the neighborhood.

15:20.643 --> 15:22.776
We don't have time for that,
but there is one place

15:22.778 --> 15:24.378
we need to take a hard look.

15:24.380 --> 15:25.946
- Where?
- The parents.

15:25.948 --> 15:28.883
What? They both have
clean records, Danny.

15:28.885 --> 15:31.252
No, everyone we talked to says
they're loving parents.

15:31.254 --> 15:33.587
Okay, but they're loving
parents who are under

15:33.589 --> 15:35.556
a tremendous amount of
pressure with a sick kid.

15:35.558 --> 15:36.924
No, I think you're reaching.

15:38.327 --> 15:40.661
If you have any other
ideas, I'm all ears.

15:40.663 --> 15:42.363
Otherwise, you take the mom

15:42.365 --> 15:43.664
and I'll take the dad.

15:43.666 --> 15:45.132
Hey, Commissioner.

15:45.134 --> 15:46.600
Detective.

15:46.602 --> 15:47.968
Gramps.

15:47.970 --> 15:49.436
What brings you down here?

15:49.438 --> 15:50.671
The boys told me you were
working round the clock,

15:50.673 --> 15:52.706
so I brought you a
roast beef sandwich.

15:52.708 --> 15:54.475
Thank you. You shouldn't have.

15:54.477 --> 15:57.211
Jack told me about this
contest that Sean won.

15:57.213 --> 15:59.413
Yeah. I'm proud of him.

15:59.415 --> 16:01.582
I'm gonna get back
to work, Gramps.

16:01.584 --> 16:04.551
Too bad he's not
going to the ceremony.

16:04.553 --> 16:08.289
So it wasn't the sandwich that
actually brought you down here.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.990
He should go.

16:09.992 --> 16:11.558
It's important.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.461
I know. But the kid doesn't
want to bawl in public.

16:14.463 --> 16:16.130
And, you know what, I get it.

16:16.132 --> 16:17.498
Linda wouldn't.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.700
Linda was always better with the
emotional stuff than me, Gramps.

16:19.702 --> 16:21.568
I wouldn't even know
what to say to the kid.

16:21.570 --> 16:24.772
Maybe it's time
you figured it out.

16:27.342 --> 16:29.476
Boss, there's no dirt on him.

16:29.478 --> 16:31.645
Detective Wallace
is a twice-decorated.

16:31.647 --> 16:33.447
Narcotics detective.

16:33.449 --> 16:35.316
- The skel, on the other hand...
- The plaintiff?

16:35.318 --> 16:37.785
Okay, okay, the 13 collars

16:37.787 --> 16:40.955
and five convictions for
selling drugs plaintiff,

16:40.957 --> 16:43.357
who spent three of the
last six years in prison,

16:43.359 --> 16:46.560
is maybe less than
reliable, truth-wise.

16:46.562 --> 16:48.963
So, we're either feeding
and housing him in prison,

16:48.965 --> 16:52.366
or handing him a big
bag of cash when he gets out.

16:52.368 --> 16:54.635
Is this a great country or what?

16:54.637 --> 16:56.003
Yeah, for him. Gee, guys,

16:56.005 --> 16:57.671
why don't I go
saddle up the horses?

16:59.207 --> 17:02.376
Anybody see this guy
fall down the stairs?

17:02.378 --> 17:04.078
Just Detective Wallace.
Said the guy tripped

17:04.079 --> 17:05.945
over his own feet
fleeing down a staircase,

17:05.948 --> 17:07.948
wearing his high-tops
all big and loose.

17:07.950 --> 17:09.483
Perp says Wallace pushed him.

17:09.484 --> 17:11.385
Civilian Complaint Review Board
believed him.

17:11.387 --> 17:12.553
End of story.

17:12.555 --> 17:14.521
Well, what if it's
the wrong end to the story?

17:14.522 --> 17:15.556
What are you gonna do,

17:15.558 --> 17:17.257
form a Police Complaint
Review Board?

17:17.259 --> 17:18.525
Good luck with that.

17:18.527 --> 17:20.461
I was a cop for a long time.

17:20.463 --> 17:22.529
I've seen every scam,
every wiggle,

17:22.531 --> 17:24.598
every dodge ever invented.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.266
I should be numb to it,

17:26.268 --> 17:30.471
but, in this case,
it's the principle of the thing.

17:30.473 --> 17:32.439
Wow, I can't remember
the last time

17:32.441 --> 17:33.907
I heard that one used sincerely.

17:33.909 --> 17:35.509
Well, I mean it.

17:35.511 --> 17:37.811
This ain't right.

17:40.248 --> 17:42.716
City Hall, the
corporate counsel,

17:42.718 --> 17:44.818
and CCRB say it is.

17:44.820 --> 17:46.720
And my bag of tricks
doesn't have one

17:46.722 --> 17:48.522
that makes them all
wrong and us right.

17:48.524 --> 17:51.191
What about
the plaintiff's lawyer?

17:51.193 --> 17:52.259
What do we got?

17:52.261 --> 17:54.228
Melvin Rask,
a solo practitioner.

17:54.230 --> 17:55.662
Office on Queens Boulevard.

17:55.664 --> 17:58.565
Now, we're stepping
over the line just a bit.

17:58.567 --> 18:01.835
See if he's a saint.

18:15.817 --> 18:17.418
Hey, look, um,

18:17.420 --> 18:19.987
she's got to take
medication, okay...

18:19.989 --> 18:22.923
Sorry.

18:27.429 --> 18:29.663
That's some pretty dangerous
company you're keeping.

18:29.665 --> 18:30.731
Detective Reagan.

18:30.733 --> 18:32.533
Where's your friend going?

18:32.535 --> 18:34.601
It's complicated.

18:34.603 --> 18:36.937
You're making a drop-off
to Tommy Flynn,

18:36.939 --> 18:39.606
who, last I checked,
was bagman for Freddie Shea.

18:39.608 --> 18:41.742
Look, I-I really got to go.

18:41.744 --> 18:42.976
You're not going anywhere.

18:42.978 --> 18:44.745
What are you doing hanging out
with these criminals?

18:44.747 --> 18:46.280
I-I really don't have
anything to say.

18:46.282 --> 18:47.748
Well, you better think
of something to say,

18:47.750 --> 18:49.149
and you better make sure
it's the truth.

18:49.151 --> 18:52.052
Let's go before you
get us both killed.

18:55.156 --> 18:57.257
I don't know what the hell
game you two are running,

18:57.259 --> 18:59.460
but it ends now.

18:59.462 --> 19:01.462
You don't,
you don't understand...

19:01.464 --> 19:02.596
Yeah, I understand.

19:02.598 --> 19:03.797
I understand that
you two know more

19:03.799 --> 19:05.466
about your daughter's
disappearance

19:05.468 --> 19:06.767
than you're telling us,
and you've both been

19:06.769 --> 19:08.469
running us in circles
from the beginning.

19:08.471 --> 19:10.170
- That's not true.
- Really?

19:10.172 --> 19:11.505
Then why the hell'd you

19:11.507 --> 19:12.906
throw your daughter's
boyfriend under the bus?

19:12.908 --> 19:16.176
Look, we want Emily back
more than anything in the world.

19:16.178 --> 19:17.644
Then be straight with us.

19:17.646 --> 19:19.179
We can't.

19:19.181 --> 19:21.448
You can't because you're
paying off a local thug,

19:21.450 --> 19:24.384
who, among other things, is in
the murder-for-hire business.

19:24.386 --> 19:26.787
Hold on. Are-are you accusing us

19:26.789 --> 19:28.422
of hiring him to kill
our own daughter?

19:28.424 --> 19:30.657
- Did you?
- Absolutely not!

19:30.659 --> 19:32.893
Then, you're gonna have to
convince the D.A. of that.

19:32.895 --> 19:34.595
'Cause I sure as hell
don't believe you.

19:34.597 --> 19:37.164
The truth is our
insurance won't cover...

19:37.166 --> 19:39.366
Yeah, you told us
that story already.

19:39.368 --> 19:40.934
The thing is,
even with the insurance,

19:40.936 --> 19:42.236
the surgery wiped out
our savings.

19:42.238 --> 19:44.171
And now she needs,
she needs dozens

19:44.173 --> 19:46.240
of expensive meds, she needs
doctor visits, she needs...

19:46.242 --> 19:47.808
- Emily's life was on the line.
- Right.

19:47.810 --> 19:50.410
So you two came up
with the brilliant plan

19:50.412 --> 19:53.180
of hiring Freddie Shea
to cut your losses

19:53.182 --> 19:54.581
and off your own daughter?

19:54.583 --> 19:57.384
No! We needed to borrow money!

20:00.788 --> 20:05.225
We didn't, we didn't know
where else to turn.

20:05.227 --> 20:06.927
At first, it was okay.
But with the crazy interest

20:06.929 --> 20:09.863
that he charges, we just
fell behind with the payments.

20:09.865 --> 20:12.766
So Freddie snatched Emily
till he gets his money.

20:14.003 --> 20:15.602
Why didn't you guys
tell us from the beginning?

20:15.604 --> 20:17.070
They said they would kill her

20:17.072 --> 20:20.941
if we... cooperated
with the police.

20:20.943 --> 20:23.210
We've been borrowing
from friends, family

20:23.212 --> 20:25.512
to try to make... make
the payments to pay him off.

20:25.514 --> 20:27.948
It's just... it's not enough.

20:35.757 --> 20:37.958
We'll get her back.

20:42.430 --> 20:44.765
Are counsel prepared to proceed?

20:44.767 --> 20:45.666
- Yes, Your Honor.
- We are.

20:45.668 --> 20:46.967
Ms. Lloyd.

20:46.969 --> 20:49.036
Your Honor, the
evidence will show

20:49.038 --> 20:50.137
that the pursuit in question

20:50.139 --> 20:52.172
was completely justified
and fell within

20:52.174 --> 20:53.273
department guidelines.

20:53.275 --> 20:55.275
Though the record
should reflect that.

20:55.277 --> 20:57.110
Officer Reagan, as the driver,
initiated the pursuit.

20:57.112 --> 21:00.514
However, both officers agreed
to their course of action.

21:00.516 --> 21:02.549
Though Officer Reagan
is the senior officer.

21:02.551 --> 21:04.117
I'm confused.

21:04.119 --> 21:05.886
The officers requested
a joint hearing,

21:05.888 --> 21:07.654
and I understood
they would share one defense.

21:07.656 --> 21:11.625
Your Honor, may we have a moment
to confer with counsel?

21:11.627 --> 21:12.793
That sounds like a good idea.

21:14.662 --> 21:16.363
What are you guys doing?

21:16.365 --> 21:17.965
We agreed on a unified defense.

21:17.967 --> 21:19.433
Says the commissioner's son.

21:19.435 --> 21:20.968
What's that got to do with it?

21:20.970 --> 21:22.236
When someone gets thrown
under the bus here,

21:22.238 --> 21:24.137
you think it'll be Prince
Charming or Princess Nobody?

21:24.139 --> 21:26.540
No one's getting thrown
under the bus.

21:26.542 --> 21:27.908
Actually, you both could.

21:27.910 --> 21:30.143
You two almost got an
innocent kid killed.

21:30.145 --> 21:32.145
The facts show
we did nothing wrong.

21:32.147 --> 21:33.313
Bottom line,

21:33.315 --> 21:34.948
you could lose
your shields here.

21:34.950 --> 21:36.850
It's every cop for himself.

21:50.665 --> 21:52.432
Your Honor, my partner and I

21:52.434 --> 21:53.967
would like to discharge
our counsel at this time

21:53.969 --> 21:55.669
and represent ourselves.

21:55.671 --> 21:57.104
You know what they say

21:57.106 --> 21:58.939
about folks who represent
themselves, Officer?

21:58.941 --> 22:00.607
Feels like we got nothing
to lose.

22:00.609 --> 22:02.142
Is this your wish as well,

22:02.144 --> 22:03.310
Officer Janko?

22:05.913 --> 22:07.814
Yes, sir.

22:07.816 --> 22:09.650
Monday.

22:09.652 --> 22:11.818
10:00 a.m.

22:24.114 --> 22:26.140
- She's really not looking good.
- I got it.

22:26.141 --> 22:27.307
I got the money I owe you.

22:27.308 --> 22:28.840
The ten you were short,

22:28.842 --> 22:30.909
plus another 50
'cause you screwed up.

22:30.911 --> 22:34.079
$60,000?

22:34.081 --> 22:36.248
You want to see your kid again?

22:37.517 --> 22:39.418
Yeah. O-Okay, um...

22:39.420 --> 22:41.019
Okay, $60,000.

22:41.021 --> 22:42.721
Um...

22:44.291 --> 22:46.391
And you'll-you'll bring Emily
with you?

22:46.393 --> 22:47.526
I have your word?

22:47.528 --> 22:48.894
The cash for the kid.

22:48.896 --> 22:50.996
I'll let you know
where and when.

22:53.099 --> 22:54.333
You did good. You did good.

22:54.335 --> 22:55.834
We don't have $60,000.

22:55.836 --> 22:57.102
We don't need it.
We'll give you a dummy bag.

22:57.104 --> 22:58.103
When they show up with Emily,

22:58.105 --> 22:59.771
we swoop in.
Wait, isn't that risky?

22:59.773 --> 23:02.341
You're gonna have
to trust me, okay?

23:02.343 --> 23:05.510
- Okay.
- Come on.

23:08.181 --> 23:09.381
Isn't there someone
else the parents

23:09.383 --> 23:10.716
could have borrowed
the money from?

23:10.718 --> 23:12.417
There was,
but they used them up.

23:12.419 --> 23:13.986
But a loan shark?

23:13.988 --> 23:16.388
A loan shark's money
is as green as the bank's is.

23:16.390 --> 23:18.156
Yeah, but a person
only goes that route

23:18.158 --> 23:19.996
when it's the only route left.

23:19.997 --> 23:21.590
Is there such thing
as a good loan shark?

23:21.614 --> 23:22.394
Good?

23:22.394 --> 23:23.393
Ethical.

23:23.395 --> 23:24.694
There are legitimate outfits

23:24.696 --> 23:27.731
that will loan you money
at loan shark rates.

23:27.733 --> 23:29.733
The only thing is if you
don't pay them back,

23:29.735 --> 23:31.368
they'll just repo your
car or your house.

23:31.370 --> 23:32.636
They won't abduct your child.

23:32.638 --> 23:34.771
- Yeah.
- And it's a catch-22.

23:34.773 --> 23:36.106
They don't want to loan to
you if you're desperate,

23:36.108 --> 23:37.240
but you don't need
to borrow from them

23:37.242 --> 23:38.241
if you're not desperate.

23:38.243 --> 23:39.342
We have to remember

23:39.344 --> 23:40.610
one thing here.

23:40.612 --> 23:42.112
It's their kid.

23:42.114 --> 23:44.081
I mean, they're her parents.

23:44.083 --> 23:45.315
Meaning?

23:45.317 --> 23:47.451
Meaning they'll do anything
in the world for her.

23:47.453 --> 23:49.219
Anything and everything.

23:49.221 --> 23:51.655
To the ends of the earth.

23:51.657 --> 23:53.323
I thought you two were
on the same page about this,

23:53.325 --> 23:54.624
teaching us to do for ourselves.

23:54.626 --> 23:57.260
Well, then maybe
you weren't paying attention.

23:57.262 --> 23:59.296
Sure I was.

23:59.298 --> 24:02.065
We always raised you to take
care of your own business, yes,

24:02.067 --> 24:04.401
and accept that the world
isn't fair

24:04.403 --> 24:07.404
and does not owe you
strings of happy days.

24:07.406 --> 24:08.772
But the moment you...

24:08.774 --> 24:11.641
All of you...
Came into our lives?

24:12.910 --> 24:14.511
How'd you put it that day?

24:14.513 --> 24:17.280
We made the choice to
bring you into the world.

24:17.282 --> 24:19.015
You didn't make the choice.

24:19.017 --> 24:21.284
We did, so a bargain
was struck that day

24:21.286 --> 24:25.922
that you owe us nothing
and we owe you everything.

24:28.860 --> 24:29.860
Within reason.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.095
I got that part.

24:32.097 --> 24:35.298
But you do owe us one thing,
just like we owed our parents.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.733
To take that bargain

24:36.735 --> 24:38.068
as seriously as we did.

24:38.070 --> 24:39.603
Amen. But it's fun,

24:39.605 --> 24:41.238
too, right?
Bringing kids into the world?

24:42.240 --> 24:43.273
Yeah, loads of fun.

24:43.275 --> 24:44.107
Course.

24:44.109 --> 24:45.976
'Cause you guys

24:45.978 --> 24:48.445
make it sound, like, so serious.

24:48.447 --> 24:50.380
Come on, it was a blast.

24:50.382 --> 24:52.015
Especially
when they were little.

24:52.017 --> 24:53.550
Yeah, they're wonderful

24:53.552 --> 24:55.218
right up until
around the age of 12.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.153
And then there's that stretch

24:56.155 --> 24:57.988
of eye-rolling

24:57.990 --> 24:59.789
and slamming of doors.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.324
And all the sarcasm

25:01.326 --> 25:02.759
you can eat.

25:02.761 --> 25:05.862
Yeah, and then it comes back
around to being a blast again,

25:05.864 --> 25:07.831
only a bigger blast.

25:07.833 --> 25:09.733
It becomes...

25:10.868 --> 25:13.069
everything.

25:36.794 --> 25:38.695
See ya, Dad.

25:40.498 --> 25:41.798
You headed out?

25:41.800 --> 25:42.933
Yeah, I'll be late.

25:42.935 --> 25:44.034
Okay. Be safe.

25:44.036 --> 25:45.268
Always am.

25:47.772 --> 25:49.372
You know, I've been giving
some thought

25:49.374 --> 25:51.975
to this whole essay
contest thing.

25:51.977 --> 25:53.376
Do we have to talk about this?

25:53.378 --> 25:54.611
Yeah, we do.

25:54.613 --> 25:58.682
I know it's been tough on you
since your mom's been gone

25:58.684 --> 26:01.117
and I can't give you
the things she used to.

26:01.119 --> 26:02.719
Just not wired that way.

26:02.721 --> 26:04.054
Okay, you're doing fine.

26:04.056 --> 26:06.056
I could do better,

26:06.058 --> 26:07.791
especially when it comes
to the hard stuff,

26:07.793 --> 26:10.026
which is why I decided
you're going to the contest.

26:10.028 --> 26:12.262
- Dad.
- You're going.

26:12.264 --> 26:14.464
Look, your mother entered you
into this thing

26:14.466 --> 26:16.833
because she knows when you
put your mind to something,

26:16.835 --> 26:17.901
you can do anything.

26:17.903 --> 26:20.370
She saw something in you
and she was right.

26:20.372 --> 26:21.705
You get that award,

26:21.707 --> 26:23.173
it's not just gonna be for you.

26:23.175 --> 26:24.241
It'll be for her, too.

26:24.243 --> 26:25.575
So man up 'cause you're going.

26:50.801 --> 26:52.269
Okay.

26:52.271 --> 26:53.336
They're in position.

26:53.338 --> 26:55.138
Nobody jump the gun, okay?

26:55.140 --> 26:56.640
I want Bennett and his daughter

26:56.642 --> 26:57.774
out of harm's way

26:57.776 --> 26:59.376
before anyone moves on Flynn.

26:59.378 --> 27:01.278
Copy that, Reagan.

27:02.947 --> 27:04.781
Wait for my signal.

27:06.317 --> 27:08.852
We got eyes on the girl?
Is she in the car?

27:08.854 --> 27:10.887
Can't get a clear image yet.

27:12.023 --> 27:14.257
You got the cash?

27:14.259 --> 27:16.059
Yeah.

27:16.061 --> 27:18.061
I want, I want, I want
to see my daughter first.

27:18.063 --> 27:19.329
You don't call the shots here.

27:19.331 --> 27:20.697
I get the money,

27:20.699 --> 27:22.232
you get the girl.

27:22.234 --> 27:23.466
I just need to know she's okay.

27:23.468 --> 27:25.001
Come on, can we get
eyes on the girl?

27:25.003 --> 27:26.636
Anyone get eyes on the girl?!

27:26.638 --> 27:28.071
Negative.

27:29.607 --> 27:30.674
Gun.

27:30.676 --> 27:33.476
Heads up, our guy's got a gun.
Heads up.

27:35.513 --> 27:37.147
Give me the bag.

27:38.582 --> 27:40.183
We have to know if the girl's
in the car.

27:40.185 --> 27:41.418
Can you see her or not?

27:41.420 --> 27:42.886
Now.

27:47.058 --> 27:48.491
Negative. She is not in the car.

27:48.493 --> 27:50.060
Then we move. Move in.

27:50.062 --> 27:51.294
That's a go. Move in.

27:57.168 --> 27:58.401
Put the gun on the roof!

28:01.272 --> 28:02.739
Hands on the glass!

28:03.774 --> 28:05.575
Is she in there? No.

28:05.577 --> 28:06.876
Where's the girl?

28:06.878 --> 28:08.678
Hey!

28:08.680 --> 28:10.980
I said where's the girl,
jackass?

28:10.982 --> 28:13.283
I don't know what you're
talking about, Detective.

28:13.285 --> 28:14.851
Gonna play stupid?

28:14.853 --> 28:16.920
Okay.

28:16.922 --> 28:18.988
All right.
We'll do this the hard way.

28:28.199 --> 28:29.699
Just tell us where
to find Emily Bennett.

28:29.701 --> 28:31.768
I'm just the money guy, okay?

28:31.770 --> 28:33.169
I don't know where the girl is.

28:33.171 --> 28:35.505
You're a lying sack of crap.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.707
The girl dies, you and your boss
are on the hook for murder.

28:37.709 --> 28:38.942
Parents came to us.

28:38.944 --> 28:40.710
They couldn't pay.
The kid got snatched.

28:40.712 --> 28:43.113
- That's on them.
- They were desperate.

28:43.115 --> 28:45.248
You took advantage of that.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.851
Yeah? Well, kind of goes
with the job description.

28:47.853 --> 28:50.487
Which includes letting
an innocent girl die?

28:55.526 --> 28:57.494
Baez, give me
a second alone with him.

29:04.702 --> 29:05.802
So now what?

29:05.804 --> 29:07.637
Is it bad cop time?

29:07.639 --> 29:09.305
No.

29:09.307 --> 29:10.874
That's the old me.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.610
Yeah, I used to be
a loose cannon.

29:13.612 --> 29:16.079
But... had to tone it down

29:16.081 --> 29:17.680
the last few years, you know.

29:17.682 --> 29:21.785
Social media. Smartphones.

29:21.787 --> 29:24.687
Everyone's taking videos
of everything.

29:24.689 --> 29:28.024
It's not like you could
actually go around

29:28.026 --> 29:31.661
sticking people's head in
the toilet anymore, you know?

29:31.663 --> 29:34.397
But every now and again,
there is that one case

29:34.399 --> 29:37.066
where you kind of got to do
what you got to do.

29:37.068 --> 29:39.402
This actually happens
to be one of those cases.

29:39.404 --> 29:41.738
So, you're gonna tell me
what I want to know

29:41.740 --> 29:44.174
or I'm gonna hurt you.

29:44.176 --> 29:45.942
Okay, I want a lawyer now.

29:45.944 --> 29:47.177
Wrong answer.

29:58.890 --> 30:00.690
Come here.

30:00.692 --> 30:03.059
There's a sick little girl
out there,

30:03.061 --> 30:05.695
so I'm gonna give you ten
seconds to tell me where she is

30:05.697 --> 30:06.863
or I'm gonna break your arm.

30:06.865 --> 30:08.465
Ten...

30:08.467 --> 30:10.366
nine...

30:12.370 --> 30:13.937
eight...

30:13.939 --> 30:15.505
All right! All right!

30:15.507 --> 30:16.873
All right! What's that?

30:16.875 --> 30:18.074
Okay, man!

30:18.076 --> 30:19.075
Okay!

30:19.077 --> 30:20.877
Thanks for your cooperation.

30:29.285 --> 30:31.369
According to the charges,

30:31.469 --> 30:34.303
your pursuit created
a hazardous situation.

30:34.315 --> 30:36.081
All due respect, the
carjacker created it.

30:36.099 --> 30:37.332
We tried to remedy it.

30:37.334 --> 30:40.702
And your remedy put
a young boy in the hospital.

30:40.704 --> 30:42.637
Yes, sir.

30:42.639 --> 30:46.307
Patrol guide clearly
discourages high-speed chases.

30:46.309 --> 30:48.143
But it doesn't forbid
them, Your Honor.

30:48.145 --> 30:51.146
Officer Reagan,
now I warned you.

30:51.148 --> 30:53.081
Competent counsel is essential
to your defense.

30:53.083 --> 30:55.216
If you'll hear me out, Judge.

30:58.053 --> 31:00.121
When my partner
called in the pursuit,

31:00.123 --> 31:03.024
our supervisor at Communications

31:03.026 --> 31:05.026
could've ordered us
to terminate it.

31:05.028 --> 31:06.628
But no such order
was ever issued,

31:06.630 --> 31:09.197
indicating command
approval of our actions.

31:09.199 --> 31:10.865
Go on.

31:10.867 --> 31:12.634
The CSI report states
that our actions

31:12.636 --> 31:14.135
were not directly responsible
for the collision.

31:14.137 --> 31:16.204
Yeah, but if you weren't
chasing the suspect...

31:16.206 --> 31:17.338
There would've been no crash?

31:17.340 --> 31:19.407
The suspect left the
scene of the crime

31:19.409 --> 31:21.242
at a high rate of speed,
driving erratically.

31:21.244 --> 31:23.144
He could've easily caused
a crash on his own

31:23.146 --> 31:24.746
or when being pursued
by other officers.

31:24.748 --> 31:27.248
Fair point.

31:27.250 --> 31:28.283
The patrol guide doesn't
strictly forbid

31:28.285 --> 31:29.284
high-speed chases

31:29.286 --> 31:31.219
because while
they may be dangerous,

31:31.221 --> 31:35.056
they are sometimes necessary
to save lives.

31:37.427 --> 31:39.594
It's a difficult judgment
to make.

31:39.596 --> 31:42.330
Yes, sir, and they have to
be made in a split second.

31:42.332 --> 31:43.798
That's what we get paid to do.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.534
Officer Janko and I knew

31:46.536 --> 31:49.671
that there could be consequences
if we initiated a pursuit.

31:49.673 --> 31:54.309
But with a child's life possibly
at risk, we felt we had to act.

31:54.311 --> 31:56.511
At the Academy, we learned

31:56.513 --> 31:58.947
that good decisions
sometimes have bad results.

31:58.949 --> 32:01.049
It comes with the uniform.

32:01.051 --> 32:04.786
We stand by the decision
that we made.

32:18.434 --> 32:20.468
Go! Go!

32:29.044 --> 32:30.979
Two went this way, two of you.

32:39.456 --> 32:41.289
Shots fired! Shots fired!

32:41.291 --> 32:42.423
Reagan, you hit?

32:42.425 --> 32:43.891
No!

32:44.927 --> 32:46.127
I can't get...

32:55.271 --> 32:56.571
Perp down! Perp down! Clear.

32:56.573 --> 32:57.872
Go! Go! Go!

32:57.874 --> 32:59.140
Secure the gun.

32:59.142 --> 33:02.176
Weapon secured!

33:03.112 --> 33:04.579
Go.

33:05.614 --> 33:06.814
Check that way. Someone up top.

33:06.816 --> 33:08.916
Go on in. On me.

33:19.828 --> 33:20.995
Clear!

33:27.770 --> 33:29.771
Emily? Emily?!

33:29.773 --> 33:33.107
Emily, if you're in there,
it's the police. Hang on.

33:37.646 --> 33:39.113
Hang on!

33:50.793 --> 33:52.560
Emily.

33:52.562 --> 33:53.919
Please don't hurt me.

33:53.943 --> 33:55.943
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm Detective Reagan.

33:56.132 --> 33:57.665
Okay, I'm here to help you.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.133
Where are my parents?

33:59.135 --> 34:01.069
Your parents have been
very worried about you.

34:01.071 --> 34:02.136
They're at the hospital.

34:02.138 --> 34:03.805
They're waiting
for me to bring you

34:03.807 --> 34:05.907
to them right now, okay?
Can you walk?

34:05.909 --> 34:07.642
I don't think so.

34:07.644 --> 34:09.911
Okay. Well, can,
can I carry you?

34:09.913 --> 34:11.646
Is it okay if I pick you up?

34:11.648 --> 34:13.614
Yeah.

34:13.616 --> 34:17.018
Okay. I'll keep this blanket
on you, keep you nice and warm.

34:18.821 --> 34:21.188
You're-you're good.

34:21.190 --> 34:22.489
Thanks for saving me.

34:22.492 --> 34:24.359
Of course.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.862
Tell you what. You get
all better, we're even. Deal?

34:27.864 --> 34:29.397
Deal.

34:29.399 --> 34:31.431
Good.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.047
Mr. Price?

34:46.049 --> 34:47.648
We don't mean to intrude.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.051
The doctors told us that
Andrew's gonna be okay.

34:50.053 --> 34:51.918
Yeah.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.454
He'll be laid up

34:53.456 --> 34:56.724
for a while, but there shouldn't
be any permanent damage.

34:56.726 --> 34:59.193
That's a relief.

34:59.195 --> 35:02.130
We know that you blame
us for what happened.

35:02.132 --> 35:05.299
We just wanted to come by again
and say how sorry we are.

35:05.301 --> 35:07.201
We never meant for Andrew

35:07.203 --> 35:08.736
or anyone else to get hurt.

35:08.738 --> 35:13.408
Truth is... I should be
the one apologizing.

35:13.410 --> 35:15.943
You've got every
right to be angry.

35:15.945 --> 35:18.446
Yeah, well...

35:18.448 --> 35:21.849
I've had some time
to think about it, and,

35:21.851 --> 35:24.619
if I was the one
who'd been carjacked,

35:24.621 --> 35:26.687
and Andrew was
in that back seat,

35:26.689 --> 35:29.724
I sure as hell would have
wanted cops like you

35:29.726 --> 35:32.460
to get my little boy back.

35:46.074 --> 35:48.075
You're sure?

35:48.077 --> 35:50.077
100%.

35:50.079 --> 35:52.079
The skel's lawyer is not
a licensed attorney.

35:52.081 --> 35:53.281
Not in this state,

35:53.283 --> 35:54.816
or any state.
How the hell does this happen?

35:54.818 --> 35:56.050
Well, according

35:56.052 --> 35:57.952
to counsel, it happens
more often than you'd think.

35:57.954 --> 36:00.588
Well, once would be more often
than I would think.

36:00.590 --> 36:01.923
Well, apparently,
it was so simple,

36:01.925 --> 36:03.257
it just fell through the cracks.

36:03.259 --> 36:06.160
And took the reputation of
a decorated detective with it.

36:06.162 --> 36:08.996
You got anything
in your bag of tricks for this?

36:08.998 --> 36:11.421
Our lawyers are looking over the
transcripts of the hearings as we speak.

36:11.422 --> 36:14.436
This is like My Cousin Vinny,
only not funny.

36:14.437 --> 36:16.904
Well, in the movie, he actually
had a license to practice,

36:16.906 --> 36:18.573
- so it's much worse.
- No.

36:18.575 --> 36:21.843
Worse is, we're not sure
if it voids the settlement.

36:23.679 --> 36:26.013
Seriously?

36:27.816 --> 36:30.351
I have the corporation counsel.

36:30.353 --> 36:33.221
Well, put her on.

36:33.223 --> 36:36.123
No. Sir, she's here.

36:36.125 --> 36:40.428
Perfect.

36:40.430 --> 36:42.630
Let's have her.

36:47.069 --> 36:48.469
I'll need the room.

36:48.471 --> 36:50.571
Yeah.

36:52.608 --> 36:53.841
Thank you.

36:53.843 --> 36:55.676
Ma'am.

36:55.678 --> 36:57.678
Lieutenant. Madam Counsel.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.714
Mr. Moore.

37:05.054 --> 37:06.821
I gather you heard?

37:06.823 --> 37:09.023
Sure did.

37:09.025 --> 37:10.791
After our lunch,
I personally reviewed

37:10.793 --> 37:12.593
the Staten Island case.

37:12.595 --> 37:17.865
My assistant counsel
did a shoddy job.

37:17.867 --> 37:20.268
Even if Mr. Rask were licensed,

37:20.270 --> 37:22.270
that case should never
have been settled.

37:22.272 --> 37:24.839
And why is that?

37:24.841 --> 37:27.008
Myriad reasons.

37:27.010 --> 37:28.009
Name one.

37:28.011 --> 37:30.111
Which I'm not going into.

37:30.113 --> 37:34.348
But the assistant who butchered
the case is out of a job,

37:34.350 --> 37:38.252
and the D.A.'s office is
charging Mr. Rask with a felony.

37:38.254 --> 37:42.390
Unless, of course,
your office decides to settle.

37:43.559 --> 37:44.959
Is that all you got?

37:44.961 --> 37:46.294
No.

37:46.296 --> 37:48.829
Allow me.

37:48.831 --> 37:51.766
My office granted
a six-figure settlement

37:51.768 --> 37:53.200
to an ersatz attorney.

37:53.202 --> 37:55.202
This is completely on me.

37:55.204 --> 37:57.605
Can't say as you wear it well.

37:58.840 --> 38:02.443
Please don't gloat.
You're better than that.

38:02.445 --> 38:06.480
No, I'm really not.

38:12.154 --> 38:13.888
What do you want?

38:13.890 --> 38:17.358
All cases against the NYPD

38:17.360 --> 38:20.928
will be evaluated
on their merits,

38:20.930 --> 38:23.230
and not with some
damn calculator.

38:23.232 --> 38:25.266
You do know this is
the mayor's policy?

38:25.268 --> 38:28.202
I also know the mayor
trusts and respects you,

38:28.204 --> 38:29.637
as she should.

38:29.639 --> 38:32.039
Not today she shouldn't.

38:32.041 --> 38:34.208
Look, when my cops
cross the line,

38:34.210 --> 38:35.876
I expect them to pay for it.

38:35.878 --> 38:38.179
But when they do their job well,

38:38.181 --> 38:41.616
I expect the city
to back them up.

38:41.618 --> 38:45.119
And with actually
licensed attorneys.

38:46.955 --> 38:49.523
I can live with that.

38:55.230 --> 38:57.832
And please accept my apologies.

39:00.335 --> 39:02.937
Madam Counsel.

39:04.172 --> 39:05.973
Commissioner.

39:22.625 --> 39:25.126
As a former mayor
of New York City,

39:25.128 --> 39:26.727
it was my great honor to judge

39:26.729 --> 39:29.430
this year's school-wide
essay contest.

39:29.432 --> 39:30.731
It was a difficult task,

39:30.733 --> 39:32.700
given all the
outstanding entries.

39:32.702 --> 39:35.369
But one piece stood out
for its quality

39:35.371 --> 39:36.837
and passion.

39:36.839 --> 39:38.139
The winner of the Mayor's Medal

39:38.141 --> 39:41.375
for his essay,
"The Power of Family,"

39:41.377 --> 39:43.044
Sean Reagan.

40:07.335 --> 40:10.137
I'd like to dedicate
this award to my family.

40:10.139 --> 40:12.907
To my great-granddad, Henry,

40:12.909 --> 40:15.476
my grandfather, Frank...

40:17.913 --> 40:19.780
my Aunt Erin and Uncle Jamie,

40:19.782 --> 40:22.650
and Cousin Nicky.

40:22.652 --> 40:24.852
Yeah, I guess
my brother Jack, too.

40:27.190 --> 40:30.825
But most of all, to my mom,

40:30.827 --> 40:32.727
who couldn't be here.

40:34.763 --> 40:37.164
And to my dad...

40:38.734 --> 40:40.801
who always is.
