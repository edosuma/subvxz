♪ ♪

00:08.000 --> 00:10.250
-Hi!
-Hi, guys.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.583
Lark made a new friend
at the park.

00:12.667 --> 00:13.625
-Oh.
-Yeah, he's 43,

00:13.709 --> 00:14.875
his name is Larry,

00:14.959 --> 00:16.500
and I had to tell him
to leave us alone.

00:16.583 --> 00:17.875
Oh, Larry's harmless;
he just likes

00:17.959 --> 00:19.542
to be pushed on the
big swing is all.

00:19.625 --> 00:21.250
Yeah, but don't
tell him to pump.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.625
-Then something changes.
-Yeah.

00:22.709 --> 00:24.375
Hey, do you think
you could stay late tonight

00:24.458 --> 00:25.750
so we could have a date night?

00:25.834 --> 00:27.750
(sighs) I would love to,
but I'm supposed to play

00:27.834 --> 00:29.250
in a Funeral Goose gig tonight.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.333
We're rehearsing

00:30.417 --> 00:31.542
for our upcoming live album,

00:31.625 --> 00:33.166
<i>Funeral Goose Unplucked.</i>

00:33.250 --> 00:35.625
Well, yeah, that sounds
more fun than babysitting

00:35.709 --> 00:37.625
-or sitting in the audience.
-Yeah.

00:37.709 --> 00:40.250
Honestly, like,
I wish that I could quit,

00:40.333 --> 00:42.250
but I cannot break up with Tyler

00:42.333 --> 00:44.417
-both romantically
and musically.
-Uh-huh.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.083
So, the thing where you split up
but you're still living together

00:47.166 --> 00:49.083
and talking every day
isn't working out?

00:49.166 --> 00:51.709
-Yeah. That is surprising.
-It's a pickle.

00:51.792 --> 00:54.000
I just can't stand the thought
of seeing him hurt is all.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.583
Well, you know,
you don't have to.

00:55.667 --> 00:56.959
The trick to a breakup

00:57.041 --> 00:58.792
is to blindside him
in a public place

00:58.875 --> 01:00.500
so that he can't make a scene.

01:00.583 --> 01:01.542
I once broke up with someone

01:01.625 --> 01:03.500
on the JumboTron
at Dodger Stadium.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.375
Yeah. It's true.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.959
-But we got back together
pretty quick after that.
-Yeah, we did.

01:08.041 --> 01:09.792
Jen, I wish
you could just do it for me.

01:09.875 --> 01:12.041
No, no. I don't think I can.
I mean, he's my nephew.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.959
Look, it would hurt so much less
if you did it.

01:14.041 --> 01:17.792
Well, you're probably right,
and I am very good at it.

01:17.875 --> 01:20.542
Yeah, I've gotten Greg out of,
like, five gym memberships.

01:20.625 --> 01:23.041
Yeah, her secret is
that she's never been dumped,

01:23.125 --> 01:24.959
so she's not hindered
by empathy.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.291
Yeah, well,
I don't want to brag.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.792
(chuckles) I feel nothing.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.250
Aunt Jen,

01:34.333 --> 01:36.000
thank you so much
for representing the family.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.208
Uh, sit anywhere.

01:37.291 --> 01:38.834
I'd stay away from that one,
though.

01:38.917 --> 01:40.125
We tend to spit a lot.

01:40.208 --> 01:42.125
I'm actually not staying.
Listen, Tyler,

01:42.208 --> 01:45.417
we have to have a conversation
that's going to be difficult.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.041
For you.

01:47.125 --> 01:49.417
Oh, no. You're in love
with my dad, aren't you?

01:49.500 --> 01:51.542
He told me that
this day would come.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.709
Nope. No.

01:53.792 --> 01:54.834
Uh, listen,

01:54.917 --> 01:55.959
Clementine values the time

01:56.041 --> 01:57.250
that you've spent together,

01:57.333 --> 01:59.917
but now it is time
for you to part ways.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.792
So she's quitting the band.

02:01.875 --> 02:04.083
What?
This doesn't make any sense.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.583
Yeah, any closure you need,

02:05.667 --> 02:07.750
you will find
on your own personal journey.

02:07.834 --> 02:09.417
Now, if you excuse me,

02:09.500 --> 02:11.583
I'm going to circle back
to your parents' house

02:11.667 --> 02:13.250
and have a quick chat
with your dad.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.375
Wait, but what about our gig?

02:14.458 --> 02:15.750
I mean, there's a hundred bucks
on the line.

02:15.834 --> 02:17.375
-They're paying you $100?
-No.

02:17.458 --> 02:18.709
We paid them a hundred bucks.

02:18.792 --> 02:19.917
Yeah. No, that checks out.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.333
All right, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.041
Wait, weren't you
in a band in college?

02:23.125 --> 02:24.875
I was. Yeah.

02:24.959 --> 02:26.500
-Yeah.
-So, I mean...

02:26.583 --> 02:29.083
It was a Wiccan... a Wiccan band
called Bitch Hazel.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.917
Sadly, the band died
with my friend Katie.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.542
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:33.625 --> 02:34.917
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.083
She just got an internship
at Banana Republic.

02:37.166 --> 02:38.959
-Ah.
-And then she couldn't fold,
so they fired her.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.792
It was a real tragedy.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.709
And then she actually died.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.792
Okay. Well, Aunt Jen,

02:44.875 --> 02:46.917
-you got to help me out.
-Mm...

02:48.792 --> 02:50.583
-Please.
-Hmm.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.041
Ugh. Fine.

02:52.125 --> 02:53.166
All right. (chuckles)

02:53.250 --> 02:54.250
Thank you so much.

Ooh!

04:06.792 --> 04:09.542
That was
the best date night ever.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.208
Aw, but I wasn't even there.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.458
-Yeah, but you saw that
video I sent you, right?
-Yeah.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.458
It was on <i>fuego.</i>

04:15.542 --> 04:17.250
You have to come
to the next show.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.500
I already paid for it.

04:18.583 --> 04:20.041
I'm proud of you, babe.
I'm proud of us.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.875
You were rocking out
while I stayed here

04:21.959 --> 04:23.291
taking care of our kid.

04:23.375 --> 04:24.750
Yeah! Where is Lark?

04:24.834 --> 04:26.417
Is she not here?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.250
Lark!

04:30.250 --> 04:31.667
(instruments tuning)

04:31.750 --> 04:33.750
Okay, so I'm thinking

04:33.834 --> 04:36.250
that maybe we start with, like,
an ironic Britney Spears cover.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.375
And then once the audience

04:37.458 --> 04:39.667
is in on the joke,
we can kind of...

04:39.750 --> 04:41.834
Take a break for a little
Funeral Goose chatter.

04:41.917 --> 04:43.875
Mm-hmm.

04:43.959 --> 04:46.166
W-We just like to warm up
the audience a little bit.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.291
I have this great thing where

04:47.375 --> 04:48.792
I ask people
if they're from out of town.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.208
Yeah, no,
that does sound original.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.709
But I was thinking
maybe after we do

04:51.792 --> 04:52.917
"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,"

04:53.000 --> 04:54.291
because people who
were at the last show,

04:54.375 --> 04:55.625
I think,
are gonna be waiting for it.

04:55.709 --> 04:56.750
You just don't want
to disappoint the audience...

04:56.834 --> 04:58.250
Wait, you think
that people are gonna come back?

04:58.333 --> 05:00.250
Oh, yeah.
I blasted the ish out of this

05:00.333 --> 05:01.792
all over my social media.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.208
Well, in our experience,

05:03.291 --> 05:04.917
telling people
where we're going to play

05:05.000 --> 05:07.291
usually leads to people
not going to those places.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.792
Okay, well, I'm the oldest,

05:08.875 --> 05:10.375
so what I say goes.
(laughs) Okay.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.750
Five, six, seven, eight.

05:15.625 --> 05:16.583
(doorbells jingle)

05:16.667 --> 05:18.208
Are you ready to rock?

05:18.291 --> 05:19.917
Four hours past your bedtime?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.583
Whoa.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.667
What? Did we get a new roadie?

05:23.750 --> 05:26.250
Aunt Jen, this conversation
is going to be difficult.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.417
For you.

05:28.375 --> 05:29.834
You're out of the band.

05:29.917 --> 05:31.333
What?

05:31.417 --> 05:33.750
You know, I really value
the time that we spent together,

05:33.834 --> 05:36.417
but FuGu doesn't want
to cover songs.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.625
We want to <i>uncover </i>songs.
Without you.

05:39.709 --> 05:43.125
I cannot believe that you are
doing this in front of...

05:43.208 --> 05:44.250
(gasps)

05:44.333 --> 05:45.333
Oh!

05:45.417 --> 05:46.500
You're doing this

05:46.583 --> 05:48.417
so that I don't make a scene!

05:48.500 --> 05:50.667
Aunt Jen, please stop yelling.
We're just children.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.959
Bitch Hazel would have never
treated me this way.

05:54.041 --> 05:56.458
And we practiced witchcraft!

05:59.375 --> 06:02.083
I couldn't find my cauldron,
so I'm using the slow cooker.

06:02.166 --> 06:03.458
Well, how long is it gonna be?

06:03.542 --> 06:05.166
I wanted to use that
to start a chili.

06:05.250 --> 06:06.750
It's a slow cooker, Greg.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.667
I mean, I really did
not see this coming.

06:08.750 --> 06:12.250
Honestly, being on this side
of the breakup is awful.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.083
Is there anything
I can do for you, sweetie?

06:14.166 --> 06:15.834
Yes, actually. In fact, you can.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.625
I need a lock of Tyler's hair

06:17.709 --> 06:19.750
and also a gecko's tongue.

06:19.834 --> 06:22.542
And if that's too hard to find,
really just anybody's tongue.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.250
JOAN:
<i>No, stop!</i>

06:28.333 --> 06:29.875
(Joan and Donna laughing)

06:29.959 --> 06:31.291
You can't say that.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.458
Hi, Mom. Hi.

06:33.542 --> 06:34.709
Hello, dear.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.166
I'm Heather.
I'm Joan's daughter.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.625
I'm Donna. And who's Joan?

06:38.709 --> 06:39.750
Oh.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.333
Oh, you mean JoJo.

06:41.417 --> 06:42.875
-Oh.
-Oh!

06:42.959 --> 06:44.208
She calls me JoJo.

06:44.291 --> 06:46.375
I call her DoDo. (laughs)

06:46.458 --> 06:48.166
Yeah.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.375
DoDo and I go
to college together.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.542
Oh!

06:51.625 --> 06:52.583
We're in the same writing class.

06:52.667 --> 06:53.792
-Oh.
-Oh, ask her

06:53.875 --> 06:56.667
about her short story
on drunk lunches.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.375
JOAN:
Oh, stop it!

06:58.458 --> 07:00.125
You're the one
who bought the booze.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.709
I put it in a hairspray bottle.

07:01.792 --> 07:03.875
-Oh.
-(Donna laughs)

07:03.959 --> 07:05.583
It said, "Firm hold."

07:05.667 --> 07:08.792
Loosened me up right away.
It was a real panty dropper.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.834
(laughing):
So funny.

07:10.917 --> 07:12.875
-Oh.
-(laughing)

07:12.959 --> 07:14.625
JOAN:
Oh!

07:16.500 --> 07:18.208
Look at this.

07:18.291 --> 07:21.417
This is some female bonding.

07:22.792 --> 07:24.208
You know what we have?

07:24.291 --> 07:26.667
Three generations of women
right in this room.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.208
How lucky are we?

07:28.291 --> 07:29.583
Oh, we are so lucky.

07:29.667 --> 07:32.000
DoDo and I went on
a refugee Web site

07:32.083 --> 07:34.041
-on the Internet.
-Mm-hmm.

07:34.125 --> 07:36.583
I made a donation in your name.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.917
You know, I could have
made a donation myself,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.875
had I known about it.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.667
I was literally collecting
money for that last week,

07:43.750 --> 07:46.083
and you told me to go to hell.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.917
Okay, you know what I said?
I said, "Mommy's busy." Busy.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.917
-It means the same thing.
-(groans softly)

07:52.166 --> 07:54.959
Ooh! Oh, new lipstick!

07:55.041 --> 07:57.709
Yeah, DoDo picked it out
for me. It's called, uh,

07:57.792 --> 08:00.583
-Pink Orgasm?
-Oh, Mom!

08:00.667 --> 08:04.750
Maybe you're a little mature
to be wearing Pink Orgasm.

08:04.834 --> 08:07.333
DoDo says it's on fleck.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.291
-Whatever that means.
-No one knows.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.750
That's what makes it
so on fleek.

08:11.834 --> 08:13.125
Oh, fleek.

08:13.208 --> 08:15.291
It's on fleek.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.959
Wha-What are you doing?
Where you going?

08:17.041 --> 08:18.792
I'm meeting DoDo
at a coffee shop

08:18.875 --> 08:20.667
in an old laxative factory.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.417
Ooh! That sounds so fun!

08:22.500 --> 08:25.375
She knows all the hot places
'cause she's divorced.

08:25.458 --> 08:28.000
Oh. Wow. I love coffee.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.959
I can just, you know,

08:30.041 --> 08:31.542
brew some here for myself.

08:31.625 --> 08:33.750
Would you like to join us?

08:33.834 --> 08:35.083
No. That's...

08:35.166 --> 08:37.417
Okay. Bye. Love you.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.834
DoDo. More like DumDum.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.875
-Nailed it.
-(groans)

08:44.041 --> 08:46.000
Have you got any sweetener?

08:46.083 --> 08:47.834
-Uh... Oh.
-(door closes)

08:47.917 --> 08:49.375
(laughs)

08:49.458 --> 08:51.458
Ah, you are so funny!

08:51.542 --> 08:52.959
Hello there.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.375
Oh, Mom. Hi.
Sorry, I didn't see you come in.

08:55.458 --> 08:59.333
My eyes are so teary 'cause
I was just laughing so hard.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.208
This is my friend June.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.542
How do you two know each other?

09:03.625 --> 09:06.125
Well, I was just walking by,
and she told me I could

09:06.208 --> 09:08.500
pick through her stuff before
she took it to the Goodwill.

09:08.583 --> 09:11.041
(laughing)

09:11.125 --> 09:13.500
You are so funny, JuJu!

09:13.583 --> 09:15.792
Oh, I call her JuJu,
she calls me HeHe.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.500
Is that a crack at my religion?

09:17.583 --> 09:19.875
Because Silverstein was only
my married name.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.000
Oh, yeah. And divorced.
How many times?

09:22.083 --> 09:24.750
Uh, four times, but always
looking for number five.

09:24.834 --> 09:27.208
(June and Heather laughing)

09:27.291 --> 09:28.417
(coughing loudly)

09:31.667 --> 09:33.500
That's an inside joke that we...

09:33.583 --> 09:35.375
(coughs)

09:35.458 --> 09:37.041
Where's your bathroom?

09:37.125 --> 09:39.625
I got another inside joke
that needs to get out.

09:39.709 --> 09:43.125
Oh, it's just right there, uh,
first door on the left. Okay.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.500
-Miss you.
-Uh-huh.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.000
Honey, don't do this.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.166
You don't have to be jealous
of DoDo.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.250
Wha... What? Jealous of what?

09:50.333 --> 09:51.917
That you're just running around

09:52.000 --> 09:53.959
with some woman
that's half your age?

09:54.041 --> 09:56.083
Honey, she's just a friend.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.375
There's no one
that can touch the love

09:58.458 --> 10:00.333
I have for my only daughter.

10:00.417 --> 10:01.917
Honey, you don't

10:02.000 --> 10:03.792
have to keep pretending
with this woman.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.542
I am not pretending!

10:05.625 --> 10:07.041
No, I love her.

10:07.125 --> 10:09.792
She is a joy to be around.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.917
You got a sanitary setting
on your washer?

10:13.000 --> 10:16.458
Uh, it's not what you think.
It's for your towels.

10:16.542 --> 10:18.667
Oh, no. No, that-that's
what I thought.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.083
Yeah. See how we get each other?

10:21.166 --> 10:22.917
You know what
we're gonna do today, JuJu?

10:23.000 --> 10:26.291
You and I are gonna spend
the entire day together.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.667
-Oh, good!
-Yeah.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.417
Because my doctor has news
for me,

10:29.500 --> 10:31.834
and he says it's best
if I don't hear it alone.

10:31.917 --> 10:34.125
Fun! Yeah.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.917
Okay,
I'm gonna just get my keys.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.333
No, I'm driving...
while I still have this foot.

10:39.417 --> 10:41.041
You!

10:41.125 --> 10:44.250
Okay, Mom, now it is
your turn to be jealous,

10:44.333 --> 10:45.875
because JuJu and I

10:45.959 --> 10:50.000
are going to have a long
and wonderful friendship.

10:51.959 --> 10:53.500
What can I say about June?

10:53.583 --> 10:58.417
Webster's dictionary
defines "June"

10:58.500 --> 11:01.792
as the sixth month of the year.

11:01.875 --> 11:05.542
I describe her as...
I don't know.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.583
I mean, well,
I-I really don't know.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.667
You know what? Why don't we all
just shout some things out?

11:10.750 --> 11:13.500
June is...? Was...? Sorry.

11:13.583 --> 11:16.083
-WOMAN: My mother.
-Okay, then why aren't
you up here?

11:21.959 --> 11:23.709
So,
what are you guys doing today?

11:23.792 --> 11:25.667
Oh,
I have to go buy a new dress

11:25.750 --> 11:28.125
-for Tim's charity gala
next week.
-Charity gala?

11:28.208 --> 11:30.291
I want to go.
I don't even care what it's for.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.750
I mean, I'll pretend to care
as long as there's an open bar.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.667
It's called
"Vaccine But Not Heard."

11:34.750 --> 11:36.291
We sneak vaccines into places

11:36.375 --> 11:39.458
that are anti-medication,
like Darfur or Syria.

11:39.542 --> 11:40.917
Brooklyn.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.083
I-I'd like to donate
another painting

11:43.166 --> 11:45.792
-for the silent auction
like I did last year.
-Mm. Oh.

11:45.875 --> 11:48.917
Hmm. Yeah. You know,
I don't think

11:49.000 --> 11:50.625
they're gonna do the
silent auction this year.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.458
Apparently, it's insensitive
to the deaf community, so...

11:52.542 --> 11:54.333
What are you talking about?
Of course there's

11:54.417 --> 11:55.834
-a silent auction.
-No.

11:55.917 --> 11:58.417
That's why you had me forge
Ryan Seacrest's autograph

11:58.500 --> 12:00.709
on that picture,
so we could donate it.

12:00.792 --> 12:02.125
(fake laugh)

12:02.208 --> 12:03.625
Yeah, you should come.

12:03.709 --> 12:05.375
You know, just... You know what?

12:05.458 --> 12:08.250
Come and support the charity
without donating a painting.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.500
Problem solved.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.625
-What problem?
-Um...

12:14.250 --> 12:16.500
-(glass shatters)
-Oh, damn it!

12:16.583 --> 12:19.291
Colleen, why don't you come
help me find the broom?

12:19.375 --> 12:22.417
Well, why... why do you need me
to help you find a broom?

12:22.500 --> 12:24.041
(laughs) You're the one
who's always saying

12:24.125 --> 12:26.083
-we should spend more time
together.
-I never said that.

12:26.166 --> 12:29.500
What?! It's gonna be awesome.
Be with me for a minute.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.583
You cannot let Matt donate
another painting this year.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.041
No one's gonna bid on it.

12:33.125 --> 12:35.792
Well, he sold one last year
to an anonymous art collector.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.709
That was me!
Yeah, nobody was gonna buy it,

12:37.792 --> 12:41.166
-so I bought it to spare
his feelings. It's...
-(gasps)

12:41.250 --> 12:43.583
It's not his fault
nobody gets his art.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.750
Matt is just cooler
than all of us, all right?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.917
And he wears those shirts
that are size medium

12:49.000 --> 12:51.333
with all the worn-out holes
in all the right places.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.000
Yeah, we have a moth problem.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.458
I am not gonna be the one
to clip his wings.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.834
Matt needs to soar for all of us
who can't get off the ground.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.250
Tim, don't worry.

13:00.333 --> 13:01.917
His art is gonna sell this year.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.917
He's making a real name
for himself.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.458
So, the whole painting
is just Matt's signature.

13:09.542 --> 13:11.542
Man, that is cool.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.792
It's all about art
already existing in the world.

13:13.875 --> 13:16.041
You just have to put
your name on it.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.500
It's so... big.

13:18.583 --> 13:19.583
Yeah.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.583
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.166
MATT:
Hey, no one's bid on that yet.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.125
(chuckles) Man, that's weird.

13:25.208 --> 13:26.709
Mm-hmm.

13:26.792 --> 13:31.083
Ah, I'm sure people are just
measuring their trunks.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.834
(sighs)

13:35.917 --> 13:40.291
Tim. I am the highest bidder
on a year of SoulCycle classes.

13:40.375 --> 13:43.166
All I had to do was tell
people that I got wicked crabs

13:43.250 --> 13:45.458
from the bicycle seats,
and now no one wants it.

13:45.542 --> 13:47.083
Hey, we need
to get Matt out of here.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.041
No one's bidding on his
painting, just like I feared.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.625
Be patient. It may have only
taken him, like, 15 minutes

13:51.709 --> 13:55.000
to paint it, but it takes a
lot longer to appreciate it.

13:55.083 --> 13:56.667
Please, just take Matt home.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.500
No way! He's spreading
the word about my crabs.

13:59.583 --> 14:01.041
And so should you.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.542
Excuse me.

14:07.750 --> 14:11.333
I see you like, uh, baskets
of bath salts.

14:11.417 --> 14:15.500
Well, then it stands to reason
you would also love giant art.

14:15.583 --> 14:18.375
Huh? Need a new roof
for your shed?

14:18.458 --> 14:21.625
Or maybe you got a hallway
you want to keep secret?

14:21.709 --> 14:22.834
Hey, Tim.

14:22.917 --> 14:24.750
Hey, man, nobody's bid
on that thing.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.041
I mean, that's
my signature piece.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.875
I wouldn't worry about it.

14:27.959 --> 14:30.250
Look, I'm-I'm not scared
or anything, you know?

14:30.333 --> 14:31.709
I mean, my piece sold
last year,

14:31.792 --> 14:33.333
and that was tiny
in comparison.

14:33.417 --> 14:34.583
-Right? Right?
-Mm.

14:34.667 --> 14:35.750
Shucks.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.542
I got to pick that up.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.041
I need a broom.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.625
Hey. Heather. Heather.

14:41.709 --> 14:43.208
-Yeah.
-I need our auction stickers.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.291
It's about to close,

14:44.375 --> 14:45.792
and I need to bid
on Matt's painting.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.625
Oh, I just used
our last sticker.

14:47.709 --> 14:49.625
-What? No! I need that.
-No, no, no, no, no! Wait!

14:49.709 --> 14:52.500
-What am I gonna do?
-We get to get our picture
taken with a giraffe.

14:52.583 --> 14:54.041
I even did a little extra

14:54.125 --> 14:56.208
so we can touch his tongue.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.625
Listen, buddy,
I need to tell you...

15:01.709 --> 15:02.917
Tim, it sold.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.333
What?

15:04.417 --> 15:05.750
Oh, yes!

15:05.834 --> 15:08.000
-Problem solved!
-(chuckles)

15:08.083 --> 15:09.166
What problem?

15:10.041 --> 15:11.959
-(glass shatters)
-Dude.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.417
I better go clean that up.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.458
<i>Congratulations again.</i>

15:15.542 --> 15:17.667
It really was a great painting.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.000
Yeah. Mmm.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.125
You know, I was worried
it wasn't gonna sell.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.959
Aw, come on,
your stuff is great.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.375
You're great!

15:25.458 --> 15:27.250
When we hang out together,
it is great.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.250
Yeah.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.875
You know, Colleen told me
that you bought my painting

15:31.959 --> 15:33.834
last year to save me
the embarrassment.

15:33.917 --> 15:36.834
(laughing quietly)

15:36.917 --> 15:38.542
Uh! Tim.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.875
It's okay.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.667
I actually thought
it was really sweet.

15:42.750 --> 15:43.834
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.625
Well, hey, I'm just glad
someone else here

15:45.709 --> 15:47.417
appreciates great art.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.750
Well, that's the thing about
the art world, you know?

15:49.834 --> 15:52.750
Some days you're on top,
some days you aren't.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.166
Today's one of those
days when I'm on top.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.834
-Mr. Short.
-Yeah.

15:56.917 --> 15:57.875
Congratulations.

15:57.959 --> 16:00.208
-Hmm?
-You're the winning bidder.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.667
Well, they just bring that thing
right to your table

16:04.750 --> 16:05.792
when you win, huh?

16:11.458 --> 16:13.875
Wow. That is great.

16:13.959 --> 16:15.500
What is that, a rainbow?

16:15.583 --> 16:17.834
No, Dad, it's a penguin.

16:17.917 --> 16:19.250
Oh. Yes.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.542
Okay. Yeah.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.250
Well, it's amazing,

16:22.333 --> 16:23.917
and I love it.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.291
It's gonna be the perfect label
for Daddy's new beer.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.709
"That's amazing"?

16:28.792 --> 16:31.542
Ugh. How's she ever
gonna learn to draw

16:31.625 --> 16:33.417
when you're lying to her
like that?

16:33.500 --> 16:37.208
Look, there's nothing wrong with
having a soft spot for your kid.

16:37.291 --> 16:40.834
You're caught in the Dad Fog,
where you think that

16:40.917 --> 16:43.250
everything your kid does
is amazing.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.583
Well, I'm not soft like that.
I'm hard.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.291
-Okay, Dad.
-Look at me.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.083
Look how hard your father is.
I'm rock hard.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.875
Oh, please stop saying that.

16:52.959 --> 16:55.959
Me being hard is what made
you the man you are today.

16:56.041 --> 16:59.583
Except for the soft parts.
Those-those are on your mother.

16:59.667 --> 17:00.959
Look, Dad, you weren't
really around much

17:01.041 --> 17:02.625
when I was a kid, so...

17:02.709 --> 17:05.709
Well, that was me being
hard on you, by being absent.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.959
You never really
thanked me for that.

17:09.041 --> 17:11.959
And now may I present
the premier

17:12.041 --> 17:14.083
Greg's Revelation Wheat.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.709
Because I revel in your elation.

17:16.792 --> 17:17.959
-(laughter)
-Nice.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.834
Thanks. And I cannot "wheat"...

17:19.917 --> 17:22.083
-No.
-Yeah, okay. Cheers.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.250
Cheers.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.041
(groans)

17:25.125 --> 17:26.625
(burps)

17:26.709 --> 17:29.083
It's v-very yeasty.

17:29.166 --> 17:30.959
It's like you can chew it.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.291
Yeah, I'm just not surprised.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.959
As a child,

17:35.041 --> 17:38.041
his lemonade was... amazing.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.208
-Uh-huh.
-Mm-hmm.
-All my kids, you know.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.208
Heather had two milk stands,

17:42.291 --> 17:45.500
so we had milk, milk, lemonade.

17:45.583 --> 17:46.959
And then around the corner,

17:47.041 --> 17:49.041
-Matt made fudge.
-(strained): Yep.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.583
Thanks, Mom. Jen?

17:50.667 --> 17:52.750
(mutters nervously, chuckles)

17:52.834 --> 17:54.750
Well said.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.625
(grunts)

17:58.709 --> 18:00.667
Your beer sucks.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.667
What are you talking about?
Everybody likes it.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.083
Everybody's lying to you.
But not me.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.458
I'm giving it to you
straight on.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.000
-John.
-Hmm?

18:09.083 --> 18:11.041
Why don't you help him
work on the beer?

18:11.125 --> 18:13.333
Oh, you mean like a father
and son thing?

18:14.291 --> 18:15.750
(groans)

18:15.834 --> 18:18.250
Now we got
to hose the place down.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.458
The kill room's got to be clean.

18:20.542 --> 18:23.041
Why do you keep
calling it a kill room?

18:23.125 --> 18:25.291
Well, it's not because
of anything I did in the war,

18:25.375 --> 18:26.750
I'll tell you that.

18:26.834 --> 18:27.834
(steam hisses)

18:27.917 --> 18:28.875
-Whoa.
-Come on, Greg.

18:28.959 --> 18:30.500
Now you've let the steam out,

18:30.583 --> 18:32.458
and the flavor's
all over your face.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.250
Now stir the hops.

18:34.333 --> 18:35.834
Sure.

18:35.917 --> 18:37.542
No, no, no. With your arm.

18:37.625 --> 18:39.583
That way, you can
really feel the clumps.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.208
Oh, okay. Ooh.

18:41.291 --> 18:42.709
Yeah. No, I think I got one.

18:42.792 --> 18:45.375
Oh, let me in, huh? Ah.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.000
You know, now I understand why
you asked me to wear a tank top.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.417
I didn't ask you to wear
a tank top.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.291
Well, then who was
that voice message from?

18:53.375 --> 18:54.625
(door closes)

18:54.709 --> 18:56.417
JEN:
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.166
I was explaining
to the neighbors that

18:58.250 --> 19:00.291
you're not cooking meth,
you're making beer.

19:00.375 --> 19:03.291
That you could just buy
in a store.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.041
You won't be able
to buy beer like this,

19:05.125 --> 19:07.083
because it won't pass
the safety standards.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.250
Yeah.
We stirred it with our arms.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.375
Yeah.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.041
This was such a great day,
honey.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.458
You know, I haven't
seen you smile that big

19:13.542 --> 19:15.250
-since our wedding day.
-Yeah.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.583
When you were dancing
with your mom.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.750
You know, I always thought
that CryTunes was my baby,

19:19.834 --> 19:22.417
but this experience
just means so much to me.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.375
I think this beer is my baby.

19:24.458 --> 19:26.500
You also have an actual baby.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.667
Yeah, but I'm making this baby
with my dad.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.125
It's every son's dream.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.750
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>it's finally finished.</i>

19:33.834 --> 19:37.333
Dad, I really loved
spending this time with you.

19:37.417 --> 19:40.458
JOHN:
I loved spending time
with you, son.

19:40.542 --> 19:42.333
I know I started out
being hard,

19:42.417 --> 19:44.500
but you took everything
I gave you.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.125
-And in the end,
we came together.
-Yeah, we did.

19:47.208 --> 19:49.750
This feels private
in all the wrong ways.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.583
-Okay. Bottoms up!
-Okay.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.250
(gags)

19:54.333 --> 19:55.792
-Wow.
-Mmm.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.166
It's fantastic.

19:57.250 --> 19:58.333
Really? You like it?

19:58.417 --> 19:59.917
Oh, I love it.
I'm gonna go in there

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
and puke up breakfast
so I have more room.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.083
Greg, this is bad.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.375
Yeah, I know.
It's-it's really awful.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.125
-But did you hear that?
-Huh?

20:10.208 --> 20:11.291
My dad lied to me.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.750
For the first time,
he's in the Dad Fog.

20:14.834 --> 20:15.792
For me!

20:15.875 --> 20:16.875
-Oh.
-Ha!

20:16.959 --> 20:18.750
And you know what?

20:18.834 --> 20:21.041
I'm gonna go get lost in it.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.125
Actually, I'm gonna
give him a minute.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.625
He's puking pretty hard.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.000
(grunts)

20:33.083 --> 20:34.500
Ugh, I love this beer!

20:34.583 --> 20:36.333
Oh...

20:36.417 --> 20:38.959
I didn't know beer could give
me a foot cramp. (exhales)

20:39.041 --> 20:40.375
Yeah.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.125
Hey, guys.
What's with the sleeves?

20:42.208 --> 20:43.792
Didn't you get my voice mail?

20:43.875 --> 20:45.709
-Oh, that was you?
-Yes.

20:45.792 --> 20:47.333
Why did you want me
to wear a tank top?

20:47.417 --> 20:49.333
'Cause if one guy's wearing
a tank top, it looks weird.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.667
But if two guys are wearing
tank tops, then it's like,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.875
"I guess
guys are wearing tank tops."
