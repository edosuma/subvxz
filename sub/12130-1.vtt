02:09.253 --> 02:14.591
In the sky the bright stars glittered

02:14.759 --> 02:17.761
On the bank the pale moon shone

02:17.929 --> 02:20.055
Somebody's coming, Pa.

02:22.058 --> 02:25.644
Well, let him come.

02:26.896 --> 02:34.896
I was seeing Nellie home

02:45.331 --> 02:50.043
It was from Aunt Dinah's

02:53.131 --> 02:55.507
I was seeing

03:05.185 --> 03:08.562
Hope you don't mind
my cutting through your place.

03:08.730 --> 03:13.358
- No, I guess not.
- I'm heading north.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.739
Didn't expect to find
any fences around here.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.118
Hello, boy.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.749
- You were watching me, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

03:28.917 --> 03:34.296
I like a man who watches things
going around.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.048
It means he'll make his mark some day.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.848
Long time since I've seen a Jersey cow.

03:45.016 --> 03:49.311
You'll see a lot more.
Jerseys and Holsteins...

03:50.813 --> 03:52.856
and the like.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.818
- Can I offer you some water?
- Thanks.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.086
You're a little touchy, aren't you?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.879
Joey.

04:17.339 --> 04:22.803
- You know not to point guns at people.
- I wasn't pointing at anybody, Mother.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.978
Sure had me snorting, son.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.858
I just wanted you to see my rifle.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.904
Bet you can shoot.

04:42.323 --> 04:46.451
- Can't you?
- Little bit.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.423
Looks like your friends are a little late.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.677
What are the Ryker boys up to this time?

05:03.845 --> 05:06.221
- Rykers?
- That's what I said.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.891
I wouldn't know a Ryker
from your Jersey cow.

05:10.059 --> 05:14.646
Don't forget to close the gate
on your way out.

05:14.814 --> 05:18.191
Would you put down that gun?
Then I'll leave.

05:18.359 --> 05:21.987
What's the difference?
You're leaving anyway.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.781
I'd like it to be my idea.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.193
Howdy, Starrett.

06:02.987 --> 06:06.782
Expecting trouble?

06:06.949 --> 06:12.329
I don't want no trouble, Starrett.
I came to inform you.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.374
I got that reservation beef contract.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.794
- So many to tell me that?
- I mean business.

06:18.961 --> 06:22.964
- Then, tend to your own.
- That's just what I'm doing.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.801
I'm gonna need all my range.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.637
Now that you've warned me,
get off my place.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.931
Your place?

06:31.933 --> 06:34.726
You'll have to get out before the snow.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.313
- Supposing I don't?
- You and the other squatters.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.234
- Homesteaders, you mean.
- I could blast you out of here right now.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.902
You and the others.

06:44.070 --> 06:49.658
Listen to me. The time for gun-blasting
a man off his place is passed.

06:49.826 --> 06:53.787
- They're building a penitentiary to take care of...
- Joe, that's enough.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.503
Who are you, stranger?

07:02.588 --> 07:05.549
I'm a friend of Starrett's.

07:06.592 --> 07:10.679
Well, Starrett, you can't say
I didn't warn you.

07:10.847 --> 07:14.808
All right, you've told me.
Now get off my claim.

07:33.536 --> 07:39.791
Supper'll be ready in a little while, Joe.
Won't be very long.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.043
Wait, mister, I...

07:43.421 --> 07:47.007
I swear, I... Wait a minute, please.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.052
I take that back, what I...

07:51.220 --> 07:55.348
Look, this thing ain't even loaded.

07:55.558 --> 07:59.561
- Not loaded?
- No, no, Joey's too young to go loaded.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.022
That's his gun.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.359
If this don't beat all.

08:06.569 --> 08:12.324
My name is Starrett, Joe Starrett,
and this here's Joey.

08:12.492 --> 08:17.662
You heard what my little woman said.
Come on in, I feel like eating.

08:18.873 --> 08:23.877
- You can call me Shane.
- Guess I spook kind of easy these days.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.046
Hello, Joe.

08:29.091 --> 08:34.304
My place ain't very much yet,
but my wife sure can cook.

08:34.472 --> 08:40.519
It won't be long till supper.
You can wash up right here.

08:42.605 --> 08:48.151
In case you wanted to know,
that's Ryker's spread all over there.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.863
He thinks the whole world
belongs to him.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.241
The old-timers can't see it yet...

08:54.408 --> 08:57.369
but running cattle
on an open range can't go on.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.664
It takes too much space
for too little results.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.751
Those herds aren't any good,
they're all horns and bone.

09:04.919 --> 09:10.632
Cattle that is bred for meat and fenced in
and fed right, that's the thing.

09:10.800 --> 09:15.845
You gotta pick your spot,
get your land, your own land.

09:16.013 --> 09:20.267
A homesteader can't run but a few beef,
but he can grow grain...

09:20.434 --> 09:26.106
and then with his garden
and hogs and milk, he'll be all right.

09:27.441 --> 09:31.152
We make out, don't we, Marian?

09:31.320 --> 09:32.779
Of course.

09:39.078 --> 09:43.707
It's that calf again.
Joey, chase her out of there.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.129
Joey. Run on, son.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.218
Don't forget to shut that gate.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.139
Joey.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.269
Come on, shoo!

10:06.981 --> 10:09.983
I wouldn't ask you where you're bound.

10:11.235 --> 10:16.156
One place or another.
Some place I've never been.

10:21.954 --> 10:26.583
- The only way I'll leave is in a pine box.
- What do you mean, Pa?

10:28.252 --> 10:31.630
I mean they'll have to shoot me
and carry me out.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.175
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- It's the truth.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.470
You love this place.
We've got our roots down.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.599
- I wish you wouldn't talk that way.
- Our first real home.

10:42.767 --> 10:47.437
- What did you mean?
- Joey, be quiet. The men want to talk.

10:47.605 --> 10:52.233
There's just more work here
than I can do.

10:52.401 --> 10:56.154
If I could hire me a man that...

10:56.322 --> 10:59.741
I had one once,
but the Rykers roughed him up...

10:59.909 --> 11:02.452
so he lit out, cussing me.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.121
They knocked his teeth out.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.749
Ready for pie?

11:08.793 --> 11:14.130
If nobody else is gonna eat this biscuit,
I guess I'll have to.

11:27.395 --> 11:30.897
- We're kind of fancy, aren't we?
- What is, Pa?

11:31.065 --> 11:33.233
Good plates, an extra fork.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.361
What about me, Ma?

11:36.529 --> 11:39.698
- What's the matter, Marian?
- Nothing.

11:54.588 --> 11:58.091
That was an elegant dinner, Mrs. Starrett.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.845
Excuse me.

12:05.808 --> 12:09.811
Where's Mr. Shane going?
He didn't even say goodbye.

12:09.979 --> 12:14.691
He's not going, Joey.
He wouldn't go without taking that.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.902
I'm going outside with him.

12:18.070 --> 12:22.615
- Did you ask him to stay the night?
- I'll do that right now.

12:27.371 --> 12:31.207
Well, I'll be doggone.
Come here a minute.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.679
Joe, why don't you hitch up the team?

13:26.889 --> 13:32.310
Marian, I've been fighting
this stump off and on for two years.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.605
Use the team now,
this stump could say it beat us.

13:35.773 --> 13:41.402
Sometimes nothing will do
but your own sweat and muscle.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.114
All right.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.796
Bang! Bang!

15:25.674 --> 15:30.011
I wish they'd give me
some bullets for this gun.

15:35.768 --> 15:40.021
- Good morning, Joey.
- How did you know it was me?

15:40.189 --> 15:44.317
Well, I figured the cow couldn't work
that latch.

15:46.820 --> 15:51.157
- Why are you up so early?
- You're to stay for breakfast.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.077
Well, thank you.

15:55.329 --> 15:59.207
- Then where will you go?
- Where would you say, Joey?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.292
I...

16:02.544 --> 16:05.338
I wish you'd stay here.

16:05.547 --> 16:10.343
- Would you teach me to shoot?
- You'd like to learn to shoot?

16:10.552 --> 16:14.639
Pa wishes you'd stay too.
I heard him tell Mother.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.560
He said he didn't want you
to fight his fights for him...

16:19.728 --> 16:22.563
just help with the work.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.484
I bet you wouldn't leave
just because it's dangerous.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.362
Joey. Joey.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.156
Joey, come here this minute.

16:32.324 --> 16:37.036
I hope you'll stay, Mr. Shane.
Coming, Mother.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.163
Close the gate, Joey.

16:39.331 --> 16:44.711
What are you doing in your nightshirt?
Come in and put your clothes on.

16:44.878 --> 16:50.049
Would you like to hitch up the team
and haul that wire from Grafton's?

16:50.217 --> 16:54.053
- Anything you say.
- Get off the bed. Go on.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.223
He's holding it for me at the store.

16:57.391 --> 17:02.979
While you're there, you might as well
get yourself some work clothes.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.690
- What can I bring Joey?
- Soda-pop.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.192
You don't need anything, Joey.

17:08.359 --> 17:12.739
Be careful. I don't want my troubles
to be none of yours.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.407
Aren't you wearing your six-shooter?

17:15.576 --> 17:19.412
I didn't know there was
any wild game in town, Joey.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.039
Come on, son.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.887
Joey, come back here.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.641
Bang!

17:40.809 --> 17:42.435
Bang!

17:42.603 --> 17:47.023
- Who are you shooting at?
- Rykers. Bang! Bang!

17:47.191 --> 17:49.859
- Did you get many?
- Missed one.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.779
Well, can't stand for that.

17:52.946 --> 17:56.783
Pa, do you guess
Shane will teach me to shoot?

17:56.950 --> 18:01.162
I'll teach you myself
once I get the time, Joey.

18:02.623 --> 18:08.127
- Can you shoot as good as Shane?
- I've never seen him shoot.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.254
But I doubt it.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.966
He didn't wear his gun today.
Why's that, Pa?

18:14.176 --> 18:20.098
Well, he's trading at the store,
not holding it up.

18:20.265 --> 18:24.268
But why, Pa? Honest, why didn't he?

18:25.312 --> 18:29.482
- I don't wear one myself.
- It goes with him, though.

18:29.650 --> 18:34.320
- Somebody's coming, Joe.
- I know. It's Ernie Wright.

18:38.700 --> 18:43.287
Could you whip him, Pa?
Could you whip Shane?

18:43.455 --> 18:46.457
- Can't you ask nothing but questions?
- But could you?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.419
Oh, maybe.

18:50.587 --> 18:55.299
No call for that though, Joey.
Shane's on our side.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.802
Howdy, Joe.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.804
How are you, Ernie?

19:00.013 --> 19:02.598
- No good.
- What's the matter?

19:02.766 --> 19:05.852
I'm pulling stakes.
No use of your talking.

19:06.019 --> 19:11.649
- Now what's the matter?
- My wheat. Them Rykers raided it.

19:11.817 --> 19:16.154
Fence cut, steers drove in.
It's just stubs now.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.197
- When?
- Last night.

19:18.365 --> 19:22.034
I'm leaving, and don't try
to talk me out of it.

19:22.202 --> 19:25.621
- You can't.
- Just don't try, that's all.

19:25.789 --> 19:28.589
- I listened to you too much already.
- Go ahead, nobody's holding you.

19:28.667 --> 19:34.380
Oh, Ernie. You wouldn't leave
your home and land, and...

19:34.548 --> 19:36.799
Oh, Ernie, you...

19:36.967 --> 19:42.054
I'm wore down and out.
Tired of being insulted by them fellas.

19:42.222 --> 19:46.017
Called a pig-farmer.
Who knows what comes next?

19:46.185 --> 19:49.061
Well, don't throw your tail up.

19:49.229 --> 19:55.318
Tell you what, we'll all get together here
tonight and figure out something.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.111
I don't know about me.

19:57.279 --> 20:01.490
I'll get the word around.
You tell Shipstead and Torrey.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.245
All right,
but if we're having a meeting...

20:06.413 --> 20:11.000
it'd better be more than poking holes
in the air with your finger.

20:41.657 --> 20:46.410
- Anything I can do you for?
- I came to get wire for Joe Starrett.

20:46.578 --> 20:50.456
I've been holding wire
for Starrett for quite a spell.

20:50.624 --> 20:55.461
- Are you new?
- Yes, I'm working for Starrett.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.130
- Got ready-made pants to fit me?
- Farm rig?

20:58.298 --> 21:02.718
I outfit all these farmers.

21:07.516 --> 21:11.644
- Step right in back and try them on.
- Thanks.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.983
Will.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.073
Hey, Will.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.164
You're thirsty, ain't you, Chris?

21:36.003 --> 21:40.006
- Will. Who's tending bar around here?
- Coming right in.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.642
- How is it?
- Good enough.

21:51.810 --> 21:56.022
- How much do I owe you?
- Now, let's see.

21:56.189 --> 22:00.818
Pants, a dollar. Two shirts, 60 cents.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.655
Belt.

22:08.618 --> 22:13.873
Young man, you owe me
two dollars and two bits.

22:14.041 --> 22:17.543
What's the matter, son?
You look kind of pale.

22:17.711 --> 22:21.297
Been a long time since
I got store-bought clothes.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.216
Money don't go very far these days.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.720
A new sodbuster?

22:29.222 --> 22:31.724
Thought I smelled pigs.

22:31.933 --> 22:35.061
- Anything else?
- Got any soda-pop?

22:35.228 --> 22:40.733
I sure do. I wish more men
around here would drink it.

22:40.901 --> 22:44.028
- In my bar, in there.
- Thanks.

22:58.168 --> 23:04.423
Will. Let's keep the smell of pigs
out from where we're drinking.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.558
- Bartender.
- What can I do for you?

23:14.726 --> 23:15.935
Do you have any soda-pop?

23:20.232 --> 23:24.360
Are you gonna get him out
or do I have to?

23:27.280 --> 23:30.408
Let me take him, Chris.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.790
What'll it be?

23:37.958 --> 23:42.128
Lemon, strawberry or lilac, sodbuster?

23:45.549 --> 23:48.300
You speaking to me?

23:48.468 --> 23:52.012
I don't see
nobody else standing there.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.395
Here, have some of this.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.148
Smell like a man.

24:02.315 --> 24:07.570
Don't it smell better in here, Grafton?
Chris just fumigated a sodbuster.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.822
Just take it easy.

24:11.491 --> 24:14.285
I was just asking about sody-pop...

24:14.453 --> 24:18.747
pigs and taters
and one thing and another.

24:18.915 --> 24:23.419
Which one of them tater-pickers
are you working for?

24:23.587 --> 24:27.047
Or are you just
squatting on the range?

24:27.215 --> 24:31.010
Joe Starrett, if it's any of your business.

24:31.178 --> 24:34.472
Supposing I make it my business?

24:41.188 --> 24:42.480
Here's your soda-pop, mister.

24:49.196 --> 24:54.200
Now you and your soda-pop
get out of here and stay out of here.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.670
And don't come back.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.509
- Did you see that, Rufe?
- What, Bubba?

25:11.676 --> 25:13.969
Chris just put the run on a sodbuster.

25:14.137 --> 25:17.598
That's it. Keep them on the move.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.396
Warm it up for you?

25:24.606 --> 25:28.526
It's getting so I don't like
to ride at night.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.903
Let's hope the meeting starts.

25:31.071 --> 25:36.408
- Ls Shane going to be at the meeting?
- Mr. Shane. Yes, I suppose so.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.119
We all know why we're here.

25:39.287 --> 25:43.040
Ryker's war party's
been around to see all of us.

25:44.584 --> 25:49.505
I'm here to tell you,
I ain't leaving now or any other time.

25:49.673 --> 25:52.758
Start with you, Axel. What do you say?

25:52.926 --> 25:55.886
Well, Joe, you see...

25:56.054 --> 25:59.139
I know what I want to say.
Start with me.

25:59.307 --> 26:04.144
Ernie, we're gonna hear
everybody in turn. Go ahead.

26:04.312 --> 26:07.022
Most of you don't know Shane.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.733
- Shane, this is Yank Potts.
- Howdy.

26:09.901 --> 26:13.445
- Fred Lewis here.
- Yeah. I seen you in town.

26:13.655 --> 26:17.116
- Ernie Wright here, and Ed Howells.
- Howdy, Shane.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.244
- And Johnson.
- Howdy, Shane.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.580
- See anybody else coming?
- No.

26:22.747 --> 26:27.376
- We're waiting for Torrey.
- How far is Ryker gonna push us?

26:27.544 --> 26:30.588
Let's not talk scared,
that's what Ryker wants.

26:30.755 --> 26:34.717
He thinks he can shoo us off
like a flock of chickens.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.635
Here's Torrey.

26:36.803 --> 26:39.430
- Hello, Reb.
- Hello, Yank.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.806
About time you showed up.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.397
That's enough out of you, Yank.

26:51.484 --> 26:54.820
- And you too.
- All right. Cool off, Stonewall.

26:54.988 --> 26:58.782
Shake hands with Shane, there.
Shane's working for me.

26:58.950 --> 27:02.077
Shane. Oh, yeah.

27:02.245 --> 27:05.497
I heard about you, at Grafton's.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.500
Go on, Joe.

27:08.710 --> 27:14.840
Well, Stonewall, it's like this...
Leaving Ernie out, maybe...

27:15.008 --> 27:17.343
we've all agreed we're gonna stick.

27:17.510 --> 27:21.764
Now you're whistling.
Ain't nobody pushing me off my claim.

27:21.931 --> 27:26.518
- I think you all know that I'm staying.
- I too will stay.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.522
I'll string along,
leastways till the shooting starts.

27:30.690 --> 27:34.943
There ain't but seven of us,
if it comes to a fight.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.862
Him. That's eight.

27:37.030 --> 27:42.368
- Can't count on him.
- He's proved that much.

27:42.535 --> 27:44.411
Watch what you're saying.

27:44.579 --> 27:48.540
Shane can tell you what happened
with Ryker's man, Chris.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.085
They're talking about Shane.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.296
What is this, Shane?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.716
Let him say.

27:59.803 --> 28:04.556
- Lewis seen and heard it.
- He let Chris buffalo him at Grafton's.

28:04.766 --> 28:09.186
Fred, I told Shane
to stay away from trouble. He did right.

28:09.354 --> 28:14.441
- Let's finish the story.
- He didn't. Shane didn't let him do that.

28:14.609 --> 28:21.073
This Chris went around bragging
he put the run on a sodbuster.

28:24.577 --> 28:27.663
Shane, you don't have to leave.

28:27.831 --> 28:32.376
I figured you could talk freer
if I weren't around.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.422
It's too late to finish this now.

28:36.589 --> 28:41.343
- He didn't, did he?
- Joey, I want you to go to sleep.

28:41.511 --> 28:45.597
- It's all right, everything's all right.
- Shane isn't going away, is he?

28:45.807 --> 28:49.184
No, he isn't. Now, get back into bed.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.604
Stay there.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.986
- Shane.
- Shane.

29:00.447 --> 29:05.451
- I know you ain't afraid.
- It's a long story, Joey.

29:06.828 --> 29:10.247
I think we know...

29:10.415 --> 29:12.666
Shane.

29:16.129 --> 29:21.341
Don't stand in the rain.
You'll catch your death of cold.

29:26.556 --> 29:32.478
So, on Saturday, we'll get together
and go into town for our supplies.

29:32.645 --> 29:36.857
That's a good idea.
There's some strength in a whole bunch.

29:37.025 --> 29:40.861
I don't need no bodyguard.
I'll put on my.38 and go when I please.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.124
- Joey.
- Yes?

29:54.292 --> 29:57.878
Don't get to liking Shane too much.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.756
Why not?

30:02.342 --> 30:05.177
I don't want you to.

30:06.179 --> 30:11.642
- Is there anything wrong with him?
- No.

30:11.810 --> 30:16.772
- Then what, Mother?
- He'll be moving on one day, Joey.

30:16.940 --> 30:22.277
You'll be upset,
if you get to liking him too much.

30:25.949 --> 30:31.036
- Marian, you're pretty enough, come on.
- I'm coming.

30:31.204 --> 30:36.500
I wish she'd hurry so we could get going.
I don't like this business.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.462
Get in the wagon, son.

30:51.140 --> 30:55.727
One thing a married man
has to get used to is waiting for women.

30:55.937 --> 31:00.023
- Hurry up, Ma!
- Here she comes.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.817
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

31:01.985 --> 31:05.737
Sometimes the waiting is worth it.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.949
Take care and get a woman
worth waiting for.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.868
Water's good.

31:15.456 --> 31:18.500
Think I can get ready
as quickly as you?

31:18.668 --> 31:22.337
Hold your horses, we wanted
to see how pretty you were.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.590
Come on here.

31:28.761 --> 31:31.096
All set?

32:05.965 --> 32:07.466
Come on, girls.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.594
- Hello, Ernie.
- Morning.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.389
- Are you all set?
- Reckon we are.

32:14.557 --> 32:17.142
- Hello, Marian.
- Where's Stonewall?

32:17.310 --> 32:22.105
He got thirsty and went on in.
Said he had business that couldn't wait.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.275
I got to stay and mind the girls.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.236
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:29.572 --> 32:30.781
Come on.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.117
- Come on, Red.
- Bye, Marian.

33:43.229 --> 33:47.190
Stonewall, what are you doing?
We agreed to come together.

33:47.358 --> 33:52.696
I had a little business to attend to.
We can't buy a drink.

33:52.864 --> 33:57.075
Get down off that horse.
You're acting like a darn fool.

34:06.669 --> 34:10.547
A whole bunch came in.
They brought their women to protect them.

34:12.132 --> 34:15.385
- My jars come yet?
- Howdy, Starrett.

34:15.553 --> 34:16.887
What can I do you for?

34:17.054 --> 34:19.306
My, my, my.

34:21.016 --> 34:23.643
What will they think of next?

34:24.645 --> 34:26.772
Susan.

34:26.938 --> 34:30.358
- Did you bring your mother's list?
- Yes, Pa.

34:30.525 --> 34:32.944
Get the coal oil can from the wagon.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.531
My woman want we get together
on the Fourth of July.

34:36.699 --> 34:41.119
We make big celebration,
don't we, Marian?

34:41.286 --> 34:43.663
Fine, that's just what we need.

34:43.831 --> 34:47.292
It's Joe Starrett's anniversary,
the Fourth of July.

34:47.460 --> 34:51.045
- We'll have a big party.
- Oh, Mr. Grafton...

34:51.214 --> 34:54.299
Have you got gunpowder
for the fireworks?

34:54.467 --> 34:59.930
- How about some of those jellies?
- We'll talk about that later.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.183
- What do I get for the empty?
- The usual.

35:04.977 --> 35:07.646
- Thank you.
- Give the bottle to Will.

35:07.814 --> 35:12.275
I need some white flour, Mr. Grafton,
and four pounds of coffee.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.319
Joey.

35:17.740 --> 35:21.326
- Let me take it in.
- You come too, Shane.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.286
Thank you.

35:31.712 --> 35:34.923
Well, now lookie here what we got.

35:43.349 --> 35:49.187
That's one of the new ones.
They call him Sody-Pop.

35:49.355 --> 35:53.150
- Deal me out.
- What's the matter, Pete?

35:53.317 --> 35:57.279
Just say I'm superstitious, that's all.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.996
I guess you don't hear very well,
sodbuster.

36:06.164 --> 36:13.086
I told you, if you want to keep healthy,
stay out of here. Now, get going.

36:17.049 --> 36:23.138
Look, pig farmer. Get back with
the women and kids, where it's safe.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.726
Don't push it, Calloway.

36:28.561 --> 36:32.147
Did you hear me? I said get going.

36:35.526 --> 36:40.280
Did you think you were gonna come
and drink with the men?

36:40.448 --> 36:43.825
Set them up, bartender. Two whiskies.

36:43.993 --> 36:47.495
You bought me a drink
last time I was in here.

36:47.663 --> 36:51.208
Now I want to buy you one.

36:51.375 --> 36:54.419
You ain't gonna drink that in here.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.716
You guessed it.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.695
Let me have him.

37:20.863 --> 37:23.323
- Let him go.
- Let me have him.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.825
Go get him, Chris.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.833
Tear him apart.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.586
Get that sodbuster.

37:36.754 --> 37:40.465
- Hang one on him, Chris.
- Bust him.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.968
Break his back.

37:43.135 --> 37:45.470
This is bad, this is bad.

37:45.638 --> 37:49.349
- I'm going in there.
- No, Stonewall, stay right here.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.477
If we join in, we'll get run out.

37:52.645 --> 37:55.772
- Go on.
- Go get him, Chris.

38:00.069 --> 38:03.822
There ain't a marshal
within a hundred-mile ride.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.366
Get after him, Chris.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.912
Plow him under, Chris.

38:15.584 --> 38:18.128
Beat his brains out.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.890
Get him.

38:33.144 --> 38:38.064
- Land that right, Chris.
- Knock him into that pigpen, Chris.

38:44.613 --> 38:46.823
Dirty pig farmer.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.209
- Stop this.
- Go on, get at it.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.837
Here, men, stop this.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.676
Settle it outside.

39:43.714 --> 39:48.927
- Looks like it's all over.
- We should get out of here.

39:52.348 --> 39:56.684
- Maybe you'd like to draw straws.
- Hold on, young fella.

39:56.852 --> 40:00.480
You may have a friend
you don't know you've got.

40:00.648 --> 40:04.943
- I could use a man like you.
- I'm working for Starrett.

40:05.111 --> 40:10.365
You don't belong on the end of a shovel.
Anything to stop you drawing your time?

40:10.533 --> 40:12.784
I like working for Starrett.

40:12.993 --> 40:18.623
- Whatever he's paying, I'll double.
- It's no use.

40:18.791 --> 40:22.460
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

40:27.925 --> 40:31.469
- Pretty wife, Starrett's got.
- You dirty old man!

40:31.637 --> 40:34.973
- People don't talk to me that way.
- I'm talking that way!

40:35.141 --> 40:39.769
You had a chance. Nobody messes up
my boys and gets away with it.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.564
We'll ride you out of this valley.

40:42.731 --> 40:47.610
Gonna rough you up and ride you out
and you're gonna stay out.

40:50.030 --> 40:54.159
- Shane, come on.
- Joey, get out of here.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.581
But, Shane, there's too many.

41:00.583 --> 41:04.419
You wouldn't want me to run away,
would you?

41:06.672 --> 41:09.591
But there's too many, Shane.

41:13.637 --> 41:16.931
Go on, son, please.

41:23.939 --> 41:26.483
- Stop!
- I'll pay the damages.

41:26.650 --> 41:29.027
- No more fighting.
- Keep out of this.

41:29.195 --> 41:32.280
- This man's unarmed.
- It ain't a shooting.

41:32.448 --> 41:35.116
Quit butting in.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.368
I'll take him.

41:42.082 --> 41:45.752
Stop it, men. Stop fighting.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.061
Stop it, men.

42:04.230 --> 42:06.356
Stop this!

42:19.411 --> 42:21.246
Break his neck.

42:23.332 --> 42:27.752
- Where's Joey?
- Pa, they're going to kill Shane.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.297
- They're trying to kill him.
- Stay with your mother.

42:31.465 --> 42:34.217
- Joe, don't go in.
- Shane's in there.

42:34.385 --> 42:37.637
What Ryker's got coming
ain't fit for a woman to see.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.056
Don't go in there, Joe.

42:40.224 --> 42:42.517
Beat his brains in!

43:45.331 --> 43:47.832
Stop it!

43:48.000 --> 43:50.293
Stop it!

43:51.295 --> 43:56.966
Stop it! You fools have had enough of it.
You'll all get killed.

43:57.134 --> 43:59.719
Starrett, you and Shane
back on out of here.

44:03.849 --> 44:08.686
That's making some sense, Starrett.
You've won.

44:11.357 --> 44:15.026
- Get out of here.
- Ryker ain't paying for this damage.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.945
I'm paying for what's broke.

44:18.113 --> 44:23.743
No, by Godfrey, we're paying
for what's broke, me and Shane.

44:31.710 --> 44:37.507
Morgan, put one of the boys
on a good horse.

44:37.675 --> 44:43.054
He's got a long trip,
all the way to Cheyenne.

44:43.263 --> 44:46.224
I'm through fooling, Grafton.

44:46.392 --> 44:53.398
From now on, when we fight with them,
the air's gonna be full of gun smoke.

44:54.900 --> 44:59.529
- I saw it all, Mother, every bit.
- It's no place for you, Joey.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.906
No place for you either, Marian.

45:02.074 --> 45:07.203
I was scared. Then Pa picked up
that man and slung him on the floor.

45:07.371 --> 45:11.082
I didn't do much. It was all Shane.

45:11.291 --> 45:14.168
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

45:14.336 --> 45:19.006
You did, Joe.
It was ugly and you were both wonderful.

45:19.174 --> 45:23.928
When that chair came down on you,
Shane, I thought you were a goner.

45:24.096 --> 45:27.181
It was an easy chair, Joey.

45:31.019 --> 45:33.312
I bet you two could lick anyone.

45:33.480 --> 45:37.817
Well, one thing's for sure,
Ryker's gonna think twice.

45:37.985 --> 45:43.614
- Don't talk about Ryker any more now.
- I wish we could forget him.

45:48.620 --> 45:51.956
- This turpentine'll hurt.
- He wouldn't say nothing.

45:52.124 --> 45:55.334
No matter how much it hurt.
Would you, Shane?

45:55.502 --> 45:59.297
I'm afraid I would, Joey,
if it hurt bad enough.

45:59.465 --> 46:04.552
- It stings like anything.
- Joey, go on to bed.

46:06.764 --> 46:09.807
It does smart, I know.

46:09.975 --> 46:12.643
- Ouch!
- Gosh!

46:12.811 --> 46:17.607
- Joey, for the last time, go to bed.
- Yeah, me too.

46:17.775 --> 46:20.067
Come on, son.

46:20.235 --> 46:24.405
- Will you kiss me good night, Mother?
- All right.

46:25.616 --> 46:28.576
Your head...
Your head needs a bandage.

46:30.370 --> 46:35.291
It's good enough, Marian, it's fine.
Thanks very much.

46:37.753 --> 46:42.673
- You wanna know something, Mother?
- What is it?

46:47.012 --> 46:50.515
- What is it, Joey?
- Mother...

46:50.682 --> 46:56.145
- ...I just love Shane.
- Do you?

46:56.313 --> 46:59.690
I love him almost as much as I love Pa.

46:59.900 --> 47:03.444
That's all right, isn't it?

47:03.612 --> 47:08.658
- He's a fine man.
- He's so good.

47:09.701 --> 47:13.037
Don't you like him, Mother?

47:13.205 --> 47:16.707
Yes, I like him too, Joey.

47:16.875 --> 47:19.377
Good night, Joey.

47:33.058 --> 47:35.685
What's the matter, honey?

47:36.562 --> 47:38.563
Joe...

47:40.023 --> 47:42.942
hold me.

47:44.236 --> 47:48.030
Don't say anything. Just hold me tight.

48:00.252 --> 48:04.088
- Night, Ma.
- Good night, Joey.

48:05.173 --> 48:08.009
- Night, Pa.
- Night, son.

48:09.678 --> 48:11.721
Night, Shane!

49:10.113 --> 49:11.739
Where's Ryker?

49:13.325 --> 49:16.577
He's getting a little sleep.

49:16.745 --> 49:20.414
- He sent for me.
- Sit down for a minute.

49:20.582 --> 49:23.668
We're having a celebration today.

49:25.921 --> 49:29.966
- Where's the coffee?
- I'll put it right on.

49:37.849 --> 49:41.477
- What's going on here?
- Plenty.

49:41.645 --> 49:45.231
- Going somewhere?
- Looks that way, don't it?

49:45.399 --> 49:48.025
Don't let them bluff you, Ernie.

49:48.193 --> 49:50.486
Bluff?

49:50.654 --> 49:55.658
See that?
They killed my sow last night.

49:55.826 --> 50:00.162
Kept shooting
and yelling what they'd do next.

50:00.330 --> 50:05.042
Woke up the kids
and scared the missus half to death.

50:05.210 --> 50:10.089
- We're gonna put a stop to that.
- I said I'd stay for one more hand.

50:10.257 --> 50:13.759
Well, this is it. I had enough of Ryker.

50:17.055 --> 50:19.890
Here they come again!

50:40.078 --> 50:42.955
Right through my plowed ground.

50:44.583 --> 50:48.377
What do you think of that,
Stonewall Torrey?

50:48.545 --> 50:53.174
Well, Starrett and the rest of us
are gonna take the juice out of them...

50:53.341 --> 50:56.343
one of these days.

50:56.511 --> 51:00.014
Anyhow, I'm going to Grafton's
to get a bottle.

51:00.182 --> 51:04.894
- Show them it's Independence Day.
- Ma, you getting ready?

51:06.646 --> 51:10.107
- Good luck.
- Good luck for you too, Stonewall.

51:12.527 --> 51:15.946
Can't see a pig in sight.

51:16.156 --> 51:19.533
I don't see none,
but I sure can smell them.

51:29.086 --> 51:33.047
They cut Mr. Wright's fence
and Mr. Shipstead's too.

51:33.215 --> 51:35.382
They did?

51:35.550 --> 51:41.180
Shane, what would you do
if you caught them cutting our fence?

51:41.348 --> 51:44.558
I'd ask them
to please go around by the gate.

51:44.726 --> 51:46.602
Shane.

51:49.689 --> 51:53.818
- Come on, I'll race you to the barn.
- It's a go.

52:29.104 --> 52:33.023
Why don't you ever wear
your six-shooter, Shane?

52:33.191 --> 52:37.278
I guess I don't see
as many bad men as you do.

52:39.197 --> 52:41.323
Shane.

52:42.534 --> 52:47.872
- You want me to tell you something?
- If you want to.

52:48.456 --> 52:52.042
I saw your gun in there, one day.

52:54.880 --> 52:57.214
I took a look at it.

52:59.801 --> 53:05.472
- Are you mad?
- No, I guess not.

53:05.640 --> 53:09.643
But if I were you,
I'd leave a thing like this alone.

53:09.811 --> 53:14.565
- I wrapped it up in the blanket again.
- That's a good boy.

53:14.774 --> 53:16.817
Could I see it again?

53:18.570 --> 53:22.573
You promised you'd show me
how to shoot.

53:25.327 --> 53:27.244
Please.

53:27.412 --> 53:29.371
All right, Joey. Come on.

53:37.589 --> 53:40.090
Get them up.

53:40.300 --> 53:44.220
We've got some learning to do.
Come on.

53:44.387 --> 53:46.722
You stand right here.

53:46.890 --> 53:50.517
All right, put your arms
down to your side..

53:50.685 --> 53:55.105
Your holster's too low.
Never have your holster at arm's length.

53:55.315 --> 53:57.608
Let's fix this.

53:57.817 --> 54:03.113
You always have it here, with the grip
between the elbow and the wrist.

54:03.323 --> 54:05.199
So when your hand comes up...

54:05.367 --> 54:09.536
the gun clears the holster
without coming up too high, see?

54:09.704 --> 54:12.957
Now you try it, real fast and straight.
That's it.

54:13.124 --> 54:17.962
- Gosh, is that what real gunfighters do?
- No, Joey.

54:18.129 --> 54:21.298
Most of them have tricks of their own.

54:21.466 --> 54:24.468
One, for instance,
likes a shoulder holster.

54:24.636 --> 54:28.973
Another one puts it
in the belt of his pants.

54:29.140 --> 54:34.061
And some like two guns.
But one's all you need if you can use it.

54:34.229 --> 54:39.149
After 15 paces. No good for putting
a bullet where you want it.

54:39.359 --> 54:41.151
Which is the best way?

54:41.319 --> 54:45.322
What I'm telling you is as good as any,
better than most.

54:45.490 --> 54:50.661
- Let me see you shoot.
- What do you want me to shoot at?

54:50.829 --> 54:54.164
The little white rock over there, see?

55:06.511 --> 55:09.513
Gosh, almighty, that is good!

55:12.517 --> 55:17.021
You see, Joey?
Now look. Remember.

55:17.188 --> 55:20.316
When your hand comes up,
you still clear your holster.

55:20.483 --> 55:24.486
- Shane.
- Hello, Mrs. Starrett.

55:24.654 --> 55:28.032
- I was teaching Joey a little shooting.
- I don't want...

55:28.199 --> 55:32.036
You ought to see Shane shoot.
He's teaching me.

55:32.203 --> 55:37.708
- Yes, I know. Get ready for the party.
- Ma.

55:37.917 --> 55:40.627
Guns aren't going to be my boy's life.

55:40.795 --> 55:44.715
Why do you always
have to spoil everything? Bang! Bang!

55:44.924 --> 55:48.719
A gun is a tool,
no better or worse than any other tool.

55:48.928 --> 55:51.555
An ax, a shovel, or anything.

55:52.849 --> 55:57.603
A gun is as good or as bad
as the man using it. Remember that.

55:57.771 --> 56:03.067
We'd all be better off if there
wasn't a single gun in this valley...

56:03.234 --> 56:06.028
including yours.

56:06.488 --> 56:09.490
What's all the shooting about?

56:11.242 --> 56:15.245
You're starting the celebrating
a little early, aren't you?

56:15.455 --> 56:20.084
Well, look at that woman,
in her wedding dress.

56:20.251 --> 56:22.920
Shane, you better hitch up that team...

56:23.088 --> 56:28.258
because today we're really gonna
celebrate the Fourth of July.

56:44.567 --> 56:49.571
I'm supposed to say to the squatters,
"I'm busted but you're welcome."

56:49.739 --> 56:52.908
- It ain't that bad.
- That's easy for you to say.

56:53.076 --> 56:56.870
I've been your friend a long time,
I'm reasonable.

56:57.038 --> 57:02.292
- But something's got to give.
- Out here a man can go just so far.

57:02.502 --> 57:07.297
I've gone along with the new law.
I've stayed away from gunfighting.

57:07.465 --> 57:10.509
Sure, I've tried to buffalo the sodbusters.

57:10.677 --> 57:15.013
You got to admit,
my men have kept their six-guns cased.

57:17.142 --> 57:19.309
And now?

57:36.119 --> 57:42.040
- I can guess what's on your mind.
- Keep your guesses to yourself.

57:42.834 --> 57:46.920
- I like Joe Starrett.
- Fool ought to listen to reason.

57:47.088 --> 57:50.632
- Your reason?
- What's the matter with you?

57:50.800 --> 57:53.552
No offense, Rufe.

57:55.472 --> 57:59.433
It's your own conscience eating on you.

58:00.977 --> 58:02.060
Conscience.

58:07.484 --> 58:10.694
Hello, Torrey.
Something I can do you for?

58:12.363 --> 58:16.867
- A jug. It's the Fourth.
- Come in, come in.

58:25.877 --> 58:29.046
Jug. And a whiskey.

58:44.229 --> 58:49.858
Here's to you, Ryker,
for running Ernie Wright off his claim.

58:51.903 --> 58:53.904
Another.

58:54.113 --> 58:57.241
- Is that one of them?
- Yeah.

58:57.408 --> 59:03.664
It's a downright dirty shame.
It's all he had and he worked hard for it.

59:06.584 --> 59:12.881
I want to tell you something, Ryker.
He's running because he's a coward.

59:13.049 --> 59:19.221
And here's to me, because I ain't a coward
and you ain't getting my claim.

59:20.515 --> 59:23.642
They're hot-headed.

59:23.810 --> 59:28.730
You'd get him to draw
without any trouble.

59:28.898 --> 59:30.941
It'd be easy.

59:31.150 --> 59:36.947
You can't scare me
any more than you can Joe Starrett.

59:41.786 --> 59:44.705
No. It's Starrett we want.

59:44.872 --> 59:49.960
- Three cheers for Wyoming!
- The rest of you care to join me?

59:50.128 --> 59:53.338
Drink a toast to the greatest state
in the Union?

59:53.506 --> 59:56.425
I'm from Wyoming.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:06.727
Here's to the independence
of the sovereign state of Alabama.

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:13.734
There you are.

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:16.171
I'm through with all you Yanks.
Listen, you Yankees.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.798
Hello, Axel.

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:21.468
You're late, Reb,
we took Richmond two hours ago.

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:25.180
- Everybody, come here.
- Marian.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:28.934
You come too,
I have something important to tell you.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:34.272
- Axel.
- Ja, Mama. Now...

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:39.695
you all know what today is.
It's Independence Day.

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:43.365
Except for one man here. Yes, sir.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:48.662
This was the day, Joe Starrett
got himself hooked, by golly!

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.542
Well, no...

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:58.505
- What I'd like to say is...
- Well, say it, Joe.

01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:03.760
- I'd like to say that Axel's right.
- What did he say, Joe?

01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:10.517
I gave up my independence
10 years ago today.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:14.896
But no man ever gave it up
as easy as I did, heh.

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:20.068
And what's more, I wouldn't trade
places with any man in this world.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:26.324
- Good speech.
- Go on, Joe, give her a kiss.

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:29.369
Come here.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:34.958
Fast falls the eventide

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:39.463
The darkness deepens

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:43.842
Fail and comforts flee

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:52.010
Help of the helpless
O, abide with me

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:55.979
Congratulations.

01:02:56.147 --> 01:03:00.150
Pass the word to the boys,
I got some cheer for us.

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.361
Many more, Joe.

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:06.782
We were ready to give you up,
you and Ernie.

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:10.827
Ernie's getting out today.
Packed up kit and caboodle.

01:03:10.995 --> 01:03:14.498
- Oh, been expecting that.
- Ryker's boys bluffed him out.

01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:18.335
- Maybe he had sense.
- What were you doing in town?

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:28.762
- Joe, I want to dance.
- Oh, Marian, they've fenced me out here.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.282
Goodbye, old Paint

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:55.205
I'm a-leaving Cheyenne

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:58.250
I'm off for Montan'

01:03:58.417 --> 01:04:01.127
Goodbye, old Paint

01:04:01.295 --> 01:04:04.214
I'm a-leaving Cheyenne

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.967
Goodbye, old Paint

01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:13.181
I'm a-leaving Cheyenne

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:15.767
I'm off for Montan'

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:18.562
Goodbye, old Paint

01:04:18.729 --> 01:04:22.274
I'm a-leaving Cheyenne

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:38.415
- Joe don't want you in town by yourself.
- It's just Ryker and Grafton gabbing.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:40.250
Grafton's fair enough.

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:44.004
Another man was there,
likely hired by Ryker.

01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:48.884
- Who was that?
- Stranger, decked out like a gunfighter.

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:53.263
- Did you say "guns"?
- Yeah, two guns.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.266
- What did he look like?
- You'll know him when you see him.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:59.060
Packs two guns, kind of lean.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:01.396
He wears a black hat.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:04.482
- Is he a friend of yours?
- No.

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:08.278
A man named Wilson looks like that,
a gunfighter.

01:05:08.487 --> 01:05:11.406
- Jack Wilson?
- Gunfighter out of Cheyenne.

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:15.118
- Can't be him, can it?
- I didn't ask him his name.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:18.997
- What about him?
- What's a gunman doing around here?

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:23.376
- Pow-wowing with Ryker?
- Don't start. We don't know it's Wilson.

01:05:23.544 --> 01:05:27.839
This Wilson, would you know him, Shane?
If you saw him?

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:35.221
Maybe. If it is Wilson,
he's fast on the draw, so be careful.

01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:39.726
You seem to know a lot about
this kind of business, Shane.

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:43.146
That is enough. Come and eat
before things get cold.

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:47.150
I don't want no part of gunslinging.
Murder's a better name.

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:52.739
We eat now, everyone.
You fellows get the shoe game.

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:56.826
Torrey, I want to go to the blacksmith's...

01:05:57.036 --> 01:06:00.497
but Joe says we shouldn't go alone.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:05.001
Any time you wanna go to town,
I'll ride along with you.

01:06:05.169 --> 01:06:08.672
I'm a soldier who's done fighting
in real battles.

01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:10.924
I can shoot just as straight...

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.685
Shane.

01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:26.064
- Yes, Joey?
- Think that was him?

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:30.610
- Who?
- That man Torrey seen in town.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:33.822
Do you think that was Wilson?

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:39.494
- Don't worry about things like that.
- Rest, Joey. It's past your bedtime.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.830
Yes, Mother.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.545
- No, Joey. I'll open it.
- All right.

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:51.715
All right. I'll open the gate for you.

01:06:51.882 --> 01:06:54.217
Who goes there?

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.803
Brother Rufe's come
to pay you a little visit.

01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:16.406
Howdy, Starrett.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:20.493
Evening, ma'am.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:25.415
I had something I wanted
to talk over with you.

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:29.878
Whatever business we got,
we can talk over right here.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:35.050
I'll just lay it on the barrelhead, then.
How'd you like to work for me?

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:38.511
I work for myself.
Done enough working for others.

01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:40.930
Wait till I tell you.

01:07:41.098 --> 01:07:46.519
I'll pay you top wages.
More than you make on this patch of ground.

01:07:46.687 --> 01:07:49.189
No, I'm not interested.

01:07:49.356 --> 01:07:55.111
I haven't said it all.
You can run your cattle with mine.

01:07:55.279 --> 01:07:58.698
What's more, I'll buy your homestead.

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:03.536
Set a price you think is reasonable,
you'll find me reasonable.

01:08:03.704 --> 01:08:06.039
Is that fair?

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:10.126
You've made things hard for us,
and we're in the right.

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:14.047
Right? You in the right?

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:23.180
When I came to this country,
you weren't much older than your boy.

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:30.229
We had rough times. Me and other men
that are mostly dead now.

01:08:30.397 --> 01:08:35.068
I got a bad shoulder yet
from a Cheyenne arrowhead.

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:39.656
We made this country,
we found it and we made it...

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:42.951
with blood and empty bellies.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:47.580
Cattle we brought in were hazed off
by Indians and rustlers.

01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:51.917
They don't bother you much any more
because we handled them.

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:55.505
We made a safe range out of this.

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:59.926
Some of us died doing it,
but we made it.

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:05.682
Then people move in who never
had to raw-hide it through the old days.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:11.020
They fence off my range
and fence me off from water.

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:16.859
Some of them plow ditches,
take out irrigation water.

01:09:17.027 --> 01:09:23.616
So the creek runs dry sometimes
and I gotta move my stock because of it.

01:09:23.783 --> 01:09:27.453
And you say we have no right
to the range.

01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:31.791
The men that did the work
and ran the risks have no rights?

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:37.171
I take you for a fair man, Starrett.

01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:43.553
I'm not belittling what you did,
but you didn't find this country.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.515
There were trappers here
and Indian traders before you.

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:51.310
- They tamed this country.
- They weren't ranchers.

01:09:51.478 --> 01:09:56.524
Rights. You think you've the right
to say nobody else has got any.

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:59.777
That ain't the way
the government looks at it.

01:09:59.945 --> 01:10:05.742
I didn't come to argue.
I made you a fair proposition.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.036
What about the others?

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:12.081
- Shane knows he can work for me.
- The other homesteaders?

01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:14.751
Look, be reasonable.

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:20.757
After all, there's just so many hands
in a deck of cards.

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:29.432
- Then, I've got to say no.
- You don't give a man much choice.

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:42.028
How do you feel about it, son?
Would you like to go partners with me?

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:47.033
I don't want trouble with your father.
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:51.955
- Joey ain't quite of age, Ryker.
- How about it, son?

01:10:52.122 --> 01:10:54.582
Come here, Joey.

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:06.803
I don't want you to be sorry, Starrett.

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:11.432
I'll see you.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:31.286
What do you make of him?

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:34.497
He's no cow-puncher.

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:37.625
No. He doesn't look the part.

01:12:08.532 --> 01:12:13.911
I like Starrett too,
but I'll kill him if I have to.

01:12:14.079 --> 01:12:19.083
- I'll kill him if I have to.
- You mean I'll kill him if you have to.

01:12:20.544 --> 01:12:25.214
I can't have any run-in with the law.
You heard Grafton.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:31.471
Just get Starrett in here.
It wouldn't take much to bait him.

01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:38.728
Well, lookie here.

01:12:45.569 --> 01:12:47.612
Lookie here.

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:10.176
Why don't we just gun him
and get on with it?

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:15.556
One's run already.
It won't take much to stampede the rest.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:23.773
Remember, Wilson, you got
to make this look right to Grafton.

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.339
Hey, come here.

01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:38.764
Torrey. I wouldn't go over there, Torrey.

01:14:38.932 --> 01:14:42.059
Nobody's gonna buffalo me.

01:14:55.824 --> 01:15:01.370
- What can I do for you?
- Where do you think you're going?

01:15:02.372 --> 01:15:04.874
- To get a whiskey.
- Torrey.

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:13.007
Torrey.

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.728
Torrey.

01:15:55.008 --> 01:15:58.427
They tell me they call you "Stonewall."

01:15:59.429 --> 01:16:04.141
- Anything wrong with that?
- It's just funny.

01:16:07.187 --> 01:16:10.690
I guess they named a lot of that...

01:16:10.857 --> 01:16:14.360
Southern trash after old Stonewall.

01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:22.535
Who'd they name you after?
Or would you know?

01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:29.875
I'm saying that "Stonewall" Jackson
was trash himself.

01:16:30.043 --> 01:16:35.256
Him and Lee,
and all the rest of them Rebs.

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:39.677
You too.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:45.433
- You're a low-down, lying Yankee.
- Prove it.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:49.520
No, Torrey.

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:16.255
One less sodbuster.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.926
- What?
- He tried to pull on Wilson.

01:17:21.094 --> 01:17:25.723
- Ain't that right, Swede?
- He tried to reach for a...

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:29.685
All right. Get him out of here.

01:17:31.521 --> 01:17:34.815
Tell your friends
we'll be waiting for any more...

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:38.110
that come in looking for trouble.

01:17:39.696 --> 01:17:42.323
You understand that, Swede?

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.826
Now get him out of here.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:49.705
- What happened?
- The sodbuster tried to kill Wilson.

01:17:49.873 --> 01:17:55.878
- What's the shooting?
- Sodbuster tried to pull on Wilson.

01:18:03.553 --> 01:18:05.388
Lewis!

01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:12.144
- Lewis!
- Pa! What's happened?

01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:17.400
- Lewis!
- Fred!

01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:20.486
Fred!

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:37.920
Torrey, he is dead!

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:41.340
Ryker did it!

01:18:44.594 --> 01:18:46.887
I'll go get Starrett.

01:18:51.601 --> 01:18:55.396
Shane, we sure enough
earned our keep today.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:19:00.609
If they just leave us alone,
we'll make a farm out of this yet.

01:19:00.777 --> 01:19:03.446
Somebody's coming, Pa.

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:10.244
- Looks like Shipstead.
- It's Mr. Shipstead.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:13.122
Starrett!

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:16.417
Torrey, he is dead!

01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:19.837
Torrey?

01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:23.883
Torrey, he is dead!

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:30.973
The new man shot him,
the new man that works for Ryker did it.

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:39.315
I was across the street,
I heard anger in the voices.

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:42.401
The two of them reach for pistols...

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:46.280
but the new man is
quick, terribly quick.

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:51.160
One shot, Torrey dead.

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:54.580
- One shot.
- What happened?

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:59.877
We go to town together.
He say it be safe.

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:03.506
It was all quiet. We separate.

01:20:03.673 --> 01:20:09.136
Then the anger in the voices, I hear.
Only the anger, not the words.

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:12.473
Ryker's men were all around.

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.266
What started it?

01:20:14.434 --> 01:20:20.272
I passed Lewis,
his missus and Johnson. They're scared.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:23.984
- Who saw it?
- Just the Ryker men and me.

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:29.907
Morgan say they wait for any more
who come looking for trouble.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:34.453
Marian, you get ready.
Mrs. Torrey will need you.

01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:38.791
Shane, hitch up the team.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:41.293
What are you going to do, Joe?

01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:45.548
- Go to town. I'm gonna see about this.
- You can't go alone.

01:20:45.715 --> 01:20:49.468
- Marian, I'm going.
- She's right, Joe.

01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:55.808
But the others are all in this,
it's not just you. Wait for them.

01:20:55.976 --> 01:21:02.982
- Sooner or later, someone's got to go.
- But not now. Don't you go alone.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:09.238
The other homesteaders, I think they run.
I think they get out of here.

01:21:11.908 --> 01:21:16.745
Here comes Joe Starrett.
Wish he'd tend to his own business.

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:26.046
- What goes on?
- We're going on. I've had enough.

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:28.841
I sure figured you for a better man.

01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:33.262
You saw what's happened.
Torrey's dead.

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:36.557
Just gonna pile up your plunder and skip.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:40.185
Too scared to see Torrey
get a decent funeral.

01:21:40.353 --> 01:21:43.272
I don't want him killed. We're going.

01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:47.026
It ain't a question
of who stays or who runs.

01:21:47.193 --> 01:21:51.363
We gotta see Stonewall
get a Christian burial...

01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:55.492
and his wife hear some words of comfort
said over her man.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.912
We'll make sure it's done.

01:21:58.079 --> 01:22:02.291
Torrey's already dead.
I don't want it to happen to my man.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:08.505
Fred, if you ain't at that funeral,
I'll sure take it bad of you.

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:13.761
Well, cemetery hill's
on the way out, Martha.

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:21.393
Before my closing eyes

01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:25.314
Shine through the gloom

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:30.986
And point me to the skies

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:35.950
Heav'n's morning breaks

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:41.747
And earth's vain shadows flee

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:46.877
In life, in death, O Lord

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:47.929
Abide with me

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:08.190
Shipstead, would you please,
lead us in the Lord's Prayer?

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:16.198
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:22.830
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth, as it is in heaven.

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:25.874
Give us this day our daily bread...

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:32.172
and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:37.803
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:41.348
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power...

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:44.810
and the glory, forever. Amen.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:39.948
He's gonna bite you.

01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:27.556
Goodbye, Mrs. Starrett, we're going.

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:33.478
Goodbye, Joe. Goodbye, Axel.
Goodbye, John.

01:26:33.646 --> 01:26:36.648
Sue, you put the kids in the wagon.

01:26:36.816 --> 01:26:40.194
Wait for me, Lewis.
I'm coming with you.

01:26:41.404 --> 01:26:46.533
Wait a minute, let's not be in a hurry.
There's one more thing.

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:50.495
Torrey was a pretty brave man.

01:26:50.663 --> 01:26:54.917
We'd be doing wrong
if we wasn't the same.

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:58.295
Last time you argued that,
Torrey was alive.

01:26:58.463 --> 01:27:03.884
- You want us to stay for more of this?
- We can have a regular settlement.

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.930
We can have a town,
and churches and a school.

01:27:08.097 --> 01:27:10.807
Graveyards.

01:27:13.269 --> 01:27:16.396
You've just got to, that's all.

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:21.944
He wants you to stay for something
that means more than anything.

01:27:22.111 --> 01:27:23.946
Your families.

01:27:24.113 --> 01:27:26.949
Your wives and kids.

01:27:27.116 --> 01:27:30.744
Like you, Lewis, your girls...

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:34.373
and Shipstead with his boys.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:38.835
They've got a right to stay here
and grow up and be happy.

01:27:39.003 --> 01:27:44.341
It's up to you people
to have nerve enough to not give it up.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:51.306
That's right. We can't give up this valley
and we ain't gonna do it.

01:27:51.474 --> 01:27:57.646
This is farming country, a place for
people to bring up their families.

01:27:59.148 --> 01:28:03.235
Who's Ryker to run us
away from our own homes?

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:07.447
He only wants to grow beef,
and we want to grow families...

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:12.244
to grow them good and strong,
the way they were meant to be grown.

01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:16.623
God didn't make all this country
just for one man like Ryker.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:20.168
He's got it though,
and that's what counts.

01:28:20.336 --> 01:28:22.921
- Look, look there.
- A fire.

01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:26.174
It's Lewis's place.

01:28:30.179 --> 01:28:32.180
It's our place.

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:36.893
- Ryker lit it.
- He had no right.

01:28:37.061 --> 01:28:40.022
He wouldn't have, if you hadn't left it.

01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:42.899
I built it with my own hands.

01:28:43.067 --> 01:28:46.320
- Not the girls' room.
- I was getting round to it.

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:50.157
If we stick together,
we can put that place back up.

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:52.367
- Can't we?
- Right.

01:28:52.535 --> 01:28:56.330
We'll help you build the room,
Johnson and Joe.

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:59.041
- Shane'll help.
- Yeah.

01:28:59.208 --> 01:29:03.920
We'll get the timber
and put it right back up, right?

01:29:04.088 --> 01:29:07.299
- Yes, sir. We'll do it.
- Me too, I'll help.

01:29:07.467 --> 01:29:11.053
- You'll do that for us?
- All that, just for us?

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:16.058
Not just for you, Martha,
for all of us in this valley.

01:29:16.225 --> 01:29:19.478
Come and help.
Maybe we can save part of that.

01:29:19.645 --> 01:29:25.650
That's the spirit.
Let's get to the Lewises' place.

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:29.488
Come on, men.

01:29:29.655 --> 01:29:32.657
Hey, come on.

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:40.707
Boss. Looks like Lewis is going back.

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.674
Starrett's holding them together.

01:29:49.842 --> 01:29:53.637
- He could set fire to mine.
- Stay on your ground.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:56.390
He'll do us like he did Torrey.

01:29:56.557 --> 01:30:01.478
- There's a law against killing.
- The law is three days' ride from here.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:05.190
- You know that.
- What does that leave us with?

01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:09.111
- Give me time.
- Who's gonna fight Ryker?

01:30:09.278 --> 01:30:13.240
- He knows he's got us on the run.
- You men hang on.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:17.285
- Hang on?
- I promise something's gonna be done.

01:30:17.453 --> 01:30:19.955
But what, Joe?

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:23.500
Leave that to me.
I'll have it out with Ryker.

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:28.630
- You're taking on too much.
- If I have to kill him.

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:35.303
That's wrong. Don't even think that.

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:55.907
Starrett's got to go.

01:30:56.075 --> 01:31:00.912
I've warned him twice, but he's
pig-headed. He'll have to pay for it.

01:31:18.347 --> 01:31:21.099
Joe, you can't do it.

01:31:21.267 --> 01:31:26.313
If the Lewises have the courage
to start over, I won't let them down.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:32.402
But you can't go in town
to kill Ryker. He'll kill you.

01:31:33.696 --> 01:31:38.366
Tell him I'm a reasonable man,
things have gone far enough.

01:31:38.534 --> 01:31:42.370
Tell him I'm beat, anything,
but, by Jupiter, get him here!

01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:46.583
He'll come.
He thinks he's a reasonable man.

01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:49.294
Hello, Calloway.

01:31:59.722 --> 01:32:02.891
- He'll kill you.
- It's a chance I gotta take.

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:07.521
This is a false square knot, Joey,
it won't hold.

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:13.151
Shane. Tell him he can't go.
Tell him it won't work. Tell him.

01:32:13.319 --> 01:32:15.987
Shane!

01:32:16.155 --> 01:32:21.201
Wait, Joe, till things cool off.
Wait that long, anyway.

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:24.037
That's right, isn't it, Shane?

01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:28.750
I can't tell Joe what's right, Marian.

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:03.785
Please wait, Joe.

01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:08.456
Won't you do even this for me?

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:34.316
Starrett?

01:33:35.818 --> 01:33:37.652
Mr. Starrett.

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:06.431
- Who is it?
- Peace party, from Ryker.

01:34:09.435 --> 01:34:12.937
One of you can come across and talk.

01:34:23.699 --> 01:34:27.869
- Stay out of that garden.
- We ain't armed.

01:34:35.252 --> 01:34:38.380
Brother Rufe wants to see you.

01:34:40.549 --> 01:34:43.885
He says to tell you
he's a reasonable man.

01:34:44.053 --> 01:34:47.055
He's responsible for Torrey's killing.

01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:51.810
My brother wouldn't kill anybody.
He don't wanna go to jail.

01:34:51.977 --> 01:34:55.188
Torrey was a hot-head,
he picked on a stranger.

01:34:55.356 --> 01:35:01.194
Torrey didn't wanna be reasonable.
You wanna be reasonable, don't you?

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.988
I always figured on being reasonable.

01:35:04.156 --> 01:35:08.576
My brother's waiting.
He'll see you at Grafton's.

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:11.830
Who else?

01:35:11.997 --> 01:35:16.084
Not us. We're heading home.

01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:21.297
I'll see your brother.

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:08.762
Shane.

01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:18.062
Shane.

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:23.151
- Who is it?
- Calloway. Chris Calloway.

01:36:23.319 --> 01:36:29.574
- Stay where you are. I can drill you.
- Hold it, I got something to tell you.

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:36.498
- What do you want?
- Starrett's up against a stacked deck.

01:36:36.665 --> 01:36:38.249
Bang! Bang!

01:36:38.417 --> 01:36:41.127
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:48.343
- Why are you telling me?
- I reckon something's come over me.

01:36:48.511 --> 01:36:52.013
- I don't figure.
- I'm quitting Ryker.

01:36:52.848 --> 01:36:53.890
Bang! Bang!

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:57.393
- So long.
- Chris.

01:36:58.687 --> 01:37:00.897
Thanks.

01:37:02.525 --> 01:37:05.109
Be seeing you.

01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:08.905
Bang! Bang!

01:37:16.997 --> 01:37:21.960
No use to argue, Marian.
I'm going into this with my eyes open.

01:37:22.127 --> 01:37:23.920
No!

01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:27.841
Isn't there anything I can say
to change things?

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:30.718
Maybe this is a chance.

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:33.304
Morgan and them boys went home.

01:37:33.472 --> 01:37:37.016
You don't really believe that,
that's not the reason.

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:43.147
It's just too much for me to give up,
this place and our valley.

01:37:43.315 --> 01:37:46.025
- All the things that will be.
- Will be.

01:37:46.193 --> 01:37:47.944
Bang!

01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:51.656
Bang, bang, bang!

01:37:51.824 --> 01:37:56.035
Joey, don't point that thing!
Go play outside.

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:59.205
Play outside, Joey!

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.920
Please, dear. Go outside and play.

01:38:09.967 --> 01:38:15.597
It's just pride, that's all,
a silly kind of a pride.

01:38:15.764 --> 01:38:20.602
Don't I mean anything to you, Joe?
Doesn't Joey?

01:38:22.521 --> 01:38:24.564
Marian.

01:38:27.943 --> 01:38:34.198
Honey, it's because you mean
so much to me that I've got to go.

01:38:35.784 --> 01:38:41.122
Could I go on living with you,
and you thinking I'd showed yellow?

01:38:41.290 --> 01:38:44.918
And what about Joey?
How would I explain that to him?

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:46.628
Oh, Joe.

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:49.130
Joe.

01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:55.011
I've been thinking a lot, and...

01:38:56.513 --> 01:39:01.476
I know I'm kind of slow sometimes,
but I see things.

01:39:01.644 --> 01:39:07.649
And I know if anything happened to me
that you'd be took care of.

01:39:07.816 --> 01:39:13.446
You'd be took care of,
better than I could do it myself.

01:39:14.406 --> 01:39:18.534
I never thought I'd live
to hear myself say that, but...

01:39:18.702 --> 01:39:23.539
I guess now's a pretty good time
to lay things bare.

01:39:23.707 --> 01:39:27.669
You talk as though
I'd be glad for you to go.

01:39:27.836 --> 01:39:33.508
Honey, you're the most honest
and the finest girl that ever lived.

01:39:33.676 --> 01:39:39.931
I couldn't do what I gotta do if I hadn't
always known I could trust you.

01:39:48.816 --> 01:39:51.859
Now, don't you go counting me out.

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:57.865
I wouldn't have lived this long
if I wasn't pretty tough.

01:40:21.598 --> 01:40:25.226
Pa, Shane's got his gun on.
He's coming.

01:40:25.394 --> 01:40:27.228
Gun?

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:34.193
- What's the idea?
- Don't let him go. Don't anybody go.

01:40:34.361 --> 01:40:37.572
- This is my kind of game.
- But it ain't yours.

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:43.036
Maybe you're a match for Ryker, maybe not,
but you're no match for Wilson.

01:40:43.203 --> 01:40:47.415
Then, I'll outlast him.
But I do appreciate it, Shane.

01:40:47.583 --> 01:40:51.627
You're both out of your senses.
This isn't worth a life.

01:40:51.837 --> 01:40:56.382
Are you fighting for this shack,
this ground and nothing but work?

01:40:56.550 --> 01:41:01.721
I'm sick of it, I'm sick of trouble.
Let's move, let's go on, please.

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:06.434
Marian, don't say that.
You love this place more than me.

01:41:06.643 --> 01:41:09.937
- Not anymore.
- Even if it's true, it changes nothing.

01:41:10.105 --> 01:41:14.025
There must be some way, Shane?
Some way?

01:41:15.944 --> 01:41:19.947
- It's no use, Joe.
- No use? What's stopping me?

01:41:20.115 --> 01:41:23.409
- I am.
- Get out of my way.

01:41:24.453 --> 01:41:29.290
- Am I gonna have to fight you too?
- That depends on you.

01:41:33.712 --> 01:41:35.129
No!

01:41:40.636 --> 01:41:42.178
Stop!

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:04.575
Stop!

01:43:46.511 --> 01:43:47.678
No.

01:43:56.021 --> 01:44:00.733
Shane, you hit him with your gun.
I hate you!

01:44:08.367 --> 01:44:14.789
- Walk him around when he comes to.
- Joey, bring water and a towel.

01:44:14.957 --> 01:44:17.875
Here, Marian. Hide this.

01:44:19.419 --> 01:44:21.963
He'll be all right.

01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:26.926
No one can blame him
for not keeping that date.

01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:30.721
Shane, wait.

01:44:33.976 --> 01:44:39.647
- You were through with gunfighting.
- I changed my mind.

01:44:40.649 --> 01:44:43.484
Are you doing this just for me?

01:44:43.652 --> 01:44:46.362
For you, Marian...

01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:49.824
and Joe and little Joe.

01:44:52.911 --> 01:44:56.163
Then we'll never see you again?

01:44:56.373 --> 01:44:59.375
Never's a long time, Marian.

01:45:00.419 --> 01:45:04.255
Tell him...
Tell him I was sorry.

01:45:04.923 --> 01:45:08.009
No need to tell him that.

01:45:09.469 --> 01:45:11.512
Please, Shane.

01:45:14.016 --> 01:45:16.142
Mother.

01:45:20.856 --> 01:45:22.940
Please.

01:45:27.279 --> 01:45:30.406
Take care of yourself.

01:45:44.046 --> 01:45:47.840
Mother. Pa's coming along all right.

01:45:50.844 --> 01:45:52.470
Yes, Joey.

01:45:52.637 --> 01:45:56.807
- Why did Shane?
- Shane did what he had to do.

01:45:56.975 --> 01:46:01.562
- You don't hate Shane.
- I know, Mother.

01:46:04.941 --> 01:46:07.026
Shane.

01:46:08.236 --> 01:46:10.738
I'm sorry.

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:14.700
He didn't hear you.

01:46:22.918 --> 01:46:24.752
Shane!

01:46:28.715 --> 01:46:31.550
Shane! I'm sorry!

01:50:50.352 --> 01:50:52.853
I came to get your offer, Ryker.

01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:57.358
I'm not dealing with you.
Where's Starrett?

01:50:57.525 --> 01:51:02.946
- You're dealing with me, Ryker.
- I got no quarrel with you, Shane.

01:51:03.114 --> 01:51:06.492
You can walk out now
and no hard feeling.

01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:10.788
- What's your offer, Ryker?
- To you, not a thing.

01:51:10.955 --> 01:51:14.875
- That's too bad.
- Too bad.

01:51:15.043 --> 01:51:20.047
You've lived too long.
Your kind of days are over.

01:51:20.215 --> 01:51:25.302
- My days? And yours, gunfighter?
- The difference is I know it.

01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:29.306
So we'll turn in our six-guns
to the bartender...

01:51:29.474 --> 01:51:33.560
and we'll all start hoeing spuds,
is that it?

01:51:33.728 --> 01:51:36.230
Not quite yet.

01:51:37.732 --> 01:51:41.402
We haven't heard from your friend here.

01:51:49.244 --> 01:51:52.788
I wouldn't push too far if I were you.

01:52:14.936 --> 01:52:17.896
Our fight ain't with you.

01:52:19.107 --> 01:52:23.986
- It ain't with me, Wilson?
- No, it ain't, Shane.

01:52:24.154 --> 01:52:27.573
I wouldn't pull on Wilson, Shane.

01:52:27.741 --> 01:52:30.826
Will, you're a witness to this.

01:52:32.287 --> 01:52:36.123
So you're Jack Wilson.

01:52:36.332 --> 01:52:39.126
What's that mean to you, Shane?

01:52:39.294 --> 01:52:42.171
I've heard about you.

01:52:43.882 --> 01:52:46.967
What have you heard, Shane?

01:52:55.977 --> 01:52:59.897
I've heard that you're
a low-down, Yankee liar.

01:53:08.323 --> 01:53:10.157
Prove it.

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:43.440
Shane, look out!

01:54:19.143 --> 01:54:21.019
Shane.

01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:27.734
I knew you could, Shane.
I knew it just as well as anything.

01:54:27.944 --> 01:54:31.196
Was that him? Was that Wilson?

01:54:31.364 --> 01:54:36.326
That was him.
That was Wilson, all right.

01:54:36.494 --> 01:54:40.706
He was fast, fast on the draw.

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:44.668
Joey, what are you doing here?

01:54:46.254 --> 01:54:51.425
- I'm sorry, Shane.
- You don't have to be.

01:54:51.593 --> 01:54:56.597
- You'd better run back.
- Can't I ride home behind you?

01:54:58.099 --> 01:55:00.684
I'm afraid not, Joey.

01:55:00.852 --> 01:55:04.021
Please. Why not?

01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:08.275
I gotta be going on.

01:55:09.402 --> 01:55:12.279
Why, Shane?

01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:18.076
A man has to be what he is, Joey.
Can't break the mold.

01:55:20.038 --> 01:55:25.500
- I tried it and it didn't work for me.
- We want you, Shane.

01:55:27.128 --> 01:55:33.425
Joey, there's no living with a killing.
There's no going back from one.

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:37.471
Right or wrong, it's a brand.
A brand sticks.

01:55:39.432 --> 01:55:42.100
There's no going back.

01:55:42.268 --> 01:55:45.896
Now you run on home to your mother,
and tell her...

01:55:46.064 --> 01:55:52.027
Tell her everything's all right and there
aren't any more guns in the valley.

01:55:52.195 --> 01:55:53.987
Shane.

01:55:55.031 --> 01:55:58.325
It's bloody. You're hurt.

01:56:01.663 --> 01:56:04.623
I'm all right, Joey.

01:56:04.791 --> 01:56:11.672
Go home to your mother and father
and grow up to be strong and straight.

01:56:14.092 --> 01:56:16.134
And, Joey...

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:20.681
take care of them, both of them.

01:56:25.478 --> 01:56:27.354
Yes, Shane.

01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:43.120
He'd never have shot you
if you'd seen him!

01:56:43.287 --> 01:56:45.205
Bye, little Joe.

01:56:48.793 --> 01:56:53.380
He'd never even have cleared
the holster, would he, Shane?

01:57:02.724 --> 01:57:09.396
Pa's got things for you to do!
And Mother wants you!

01:57:09.605 --> 01:57:12.107
I know she does!

01:57:13.234 --> 01:57:13.734
Shane!

01:57:26.664 --> 01:57:28.749
Come back!

01:57:40.303 --> 01:57:42.888
Bye, Shane!

01:57:43.305 --> 01:57:49.211
