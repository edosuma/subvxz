00:30.800 --> 00:34.760
Safe keep the treasure for my boy.

00:34.800 --> 00:39.200
I know you'll
keep your word, baby.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.880
Safe keep the treasure
for my boy.

00:44.200 --> 00:48.680
Keep safe the treasure
for my boy.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.760
Fucking arrow.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.720
Fucking arrow in the middle
of the fucking desert.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.440
It's a nihilist's dream
come true.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.600
It's a hell
of a place to die.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.960
It's a hell of
a way to die.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.800
It was goddamn perfect.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.560
Shut up.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.800
You want a swig of this whiskey
before I pull that arrow?

01:48.840 --> 01:50.320
It's my destiny
to die right here

01:50.360 --> 01:53.165
with a fucking arrow
sticking out of me.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.120
With any luck, The Gent and
Comanche will die laughing.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.000
Guess I'm gonna
live another day.

02:10.039 --> 02:13.400
You got that right.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.560
Aw, hell.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.880
Fucker's gotta burn!

03:49.240 --> 03:50.400
Come on, hey!
Hey!

03:51.720 --> 03:53.800
Hey!

04:23.120 --> 04:27.760
This might be the best
dust I've ever seen.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.240
Pistol, I've been up to my ass
in dust plenty of times

04:31.280 --> 04:34.920
but this kind of dust
is like a supreme kind of dust

04:34.960 --> 04:36.960
that's been sent
from some other planet.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.120
I just want to live in dust
now for the rest of my life.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.320
Shut the fuck up!

04:48.360 --> 04:50.480
Where's Comanche?

04:50.520 --> 04:53.600
He's over there
taking a piss.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.840
He doesn't want to get
any dust on his dick.

04:57.875 --> 05:00.840
When we ride, move him
up to my left.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.280
His name is Bix.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.240
Forget Bix.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.960
From now on you're
known as Comanche.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.200
Woman:
"Had they really nailed

05:29.240 --> 05:30.360
everyone responsible

05:30.400 --> 05:32.440
for St. Louie's death?"

05:32.480 --> 05:33.680
thought Pistolero.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.000
Sorry.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.880
My finger got stuck.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.200
Next time share a little.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.200
The Six-Six-Sixers.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.680
They're back.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.200
Something is rotten
in the state of Pistolero.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.360
Take this one, motherfucker!

06:27.240 --> 06:29.760
So I say we
cut off their heads,

06:29.800 --> 06:31.240
we take 'em with us.

06:31.280 --> 06:35.360
I say we just take a few
pinkies and call it a day.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.840
Hows about we take their stash,
torch the trailer,

06:37.880 --> 06:39.280
and get the fuck
out of here?

06:57.560 --> 06:59.280
Why don't you put a smile
on your face,

06:59.320 --> 07:01.480
let some sunshine in?

07:01.520 --> 07:02.480
Life is good.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.680
You're having
a bad hair day.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.320
Ask Comanche to take
a little off the top.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.440
Thanks for that.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.720
Danke schÃ¶n for
the secondhand smoke.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.960
You got right
on the edge there,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.840
closer than a hair
on a gnat's ass.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.320
What, on the verge
of the brink?

07:33.360 --> 07:35.080
Yeah.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.440
Reading the situation
exactly right

07:38.480 --> 07:40.520
is how come I'm the pres.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.000
Hey, Comanch, listen,

07:52.040 --> 07:54.560
Pistolero wanted me
to pass on

07:54.600 --> 07:57.960
some important
information to you.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.040
There's a job opening
at Supercuts,

08:01.080 --> 08:02.800
about two and a half
miles up the road.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.480
Those motherfuckers
had it coming.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.360
Louie really was
a fucking saint.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.680
Yeah.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.640
I'm gonna keep cutting up
any motherfucker

08:13.680 --> 08:15.400
that had anything
to do with him dying.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.285
Trigger?

08:18.320 --> 08:20.520
You named your bike
after a horse.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.480
Exactly how old
is Trigger

08:23.520 --> 08:25.640
in horse-bike years?

08:25.680 --> 08:28.720
She's younger than
the woman I saw you with

08:28.760 --> 08:30.280
in that bar in Reno
last week.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.880
And I gotta tell you,
she's less horsey-looking too.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.679
Pistolero wants you
on his left.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.280
Speechless, eh?

08:54.960 --> 08:56.845
The left, huh?

08:56.880 --> 08:59.760
I never seen anybody
move up so fast before.

08:59.795 --> 09:02.640
I'll do my best
to remember that.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.560
Anything you want to get
off your chest,

09:04.595 --> 09:06.080
anything you want
to talk about,

09:06.120 --> 09:08.880
just think of us as a

09:08.920 --> 09:10.640
support group.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.200
Well, golly gee.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.760
Thanks.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.840
Let's get the fuck out of
this motherfucking hellhole!

09:43.840 --> 09:48.440
# See see, rider #

09:48.480 --> 09:53.200
# See what
you have done now #

09:53.235 --> 09:57.800
# See see, rider #

09:57.840 --> 10:03.080
# See what
you have done now #

10:03.120 --> 10:05.820
# You made me love you #

10:05.855 --> 10:08.520
# Now your man has come #

10:08.560 --> 10:11.360
# See see, rider #

10:11.395 --> 10:14.160
# Oh, I'm going #

10:14.200 --> 10:16.580
# Away now, baby #

10:16.615 --> 10:18.887
# And I won't be #

10:18.922 --> 10:21.160
# Back no more, yeah #

10:21.200 --> 10:23.120
# Oh, I'm goin' #

10:23.160 --> 10:26.000
# Away now, baby #

10:26.040 --> 10:28.120
# And I won't be #

10:28.160 --> 10:30.000
# Back no more, yeah #

10:30.040 --> 10:33.600
# And if I find me
a new girl #

10:33.640 --> 10:36.400
# I won't be back at all. #

11:00.920 --> 11:02.480
# Jenny Jenny Jenny #

11:02.520 --> 11:05.640
# Won't you
come along with me? #

11:05.680 --> 11:07.240
# Jenny Jenny Jenny #

11:07.280 --> 11:10.280
# Won't you
come along with me? #

11:14.720 --> 11:16.080
# Spinning spinning
spinning #

11:16.120 --> 11:17.680
# Spinning like
a spinning top #

11:17.720 --> 11:19.440
# Jenny Jenny Jenny #

11:19.480 --> 11:20.880
# Spinning spinning
spinning #

11:20.920 --> 11:22.720
# Spinning like
a spinning top... #

11:35.760 --> 11:37.680
Bob The Bum.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.800
We are

11:40.840 --> 11:43.400
financially solvent.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.640
Bob The Bum, it's good to be
financially solvent.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.360
Hey, can we talk?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.160
You want to talk?

11:55.200 --> 11:57.200
Yeah, it's kind of
important.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.920
Now?

12:00.960 --> 12:05.120
Yeah, this is kind of like
real fucking important.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.880
Can't it wait a couple
of hours, you bum?

12:06.920 --> 12:09.320
We'll talk in about
a month and a half.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.520
# Spinning spinning #

12:25.560 --> 12:27.160
# Spinning like
a spinning top... #

13:12.400 --> 13:15.000
Woman's voice:
It was America's Bicentennial.

13:15.040 --> 13:19.440
And for Johnny, St. Louie,
and Eddie Zero,

13:20.800 --> 13:23.200
rebellion was
still in the air.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.160
Sonny.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.280
Cherokee's voice:
The three Victors had a little business

14:19.320 --> 14:21.680
with The Deuce
and Billy Wings.

14:23.840 --> 14:28.440
It was the beginning
of bad blood.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.440
Woman:
Wanna fuck?

14:46.040 --> 14:47.840
# Fast train... #

14:51.880 --> 14:53.880
Trust me, after I
give you the bad news

14:53.920 --> 14:56.400
you ain't gonna
want to fuck

14:56.440 --> 14:58.480
ever again.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.000
# What's at the heart #

15:04.040 --> 15:05.440
Fuck me good one more time

15:05.480 --> 15:07.760
before you never want
to fuck again.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.800
I'm the messenger
of misery, baby.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.880
# Of your engine's rage? #

15:12.920 --> 15:14.360
Let's fuck first.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.880
Then I'll deliver
my miserable message.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.720
# To what smooth place #

15:21.760 --> 15:23.960
# At the end of the line #

15:24.000 --> 15:26.400
# With crackling fires #

15:26.440 --> 15:28.200
# And quiet plains #

15:28.240 --> 15:31.720
# Do the trees bend down #

15:31.760 --> 15:36.040
# Fold their limbs
round you? #

15:36.080 --> 15:39.360
# Welcome home,
faithful one... #

15:39.400 --> 15:41.600
Let's fuck right here.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.000
We never fucked right here
before.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.560
Fuck me good
right here, baby.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.000
If you don't fuck me
right now

15:52.040 --> 15:53.480
you're going
straight to hell.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.920
Baby, I'm already in hell.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.280
Apparently I made
a reservation this morning.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.120
Did you make
your reservation for two?

16:04.120 --> 16:05.920
It's a very strict
dress code in hell.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.720
You just can't
waltz into hell.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.680
- There's a doorman outside...
- Baby...

16:12.640 --> 16:15.160
I was built for hell.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.320
I'm your devil babe.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.280
I'm your very own
personal hellcat...

16:26.000 --> 16:28.120
hellhole.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.600
Mmm.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.040
Baby, you're good.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.200
Maybe you're bad.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.400
Give me the info.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.520
Can I ask you
something first?

16:57.560 --> 17:00.200
Go ahead.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.480
Just what kind of
fucking president are you?

17:03.520 --> 17:05.839
Everybody wants
you assassinated.

17:05.880 --> 17:09.680
Maybe you don't belong
in the presidential suite.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.800
I'm better than the C.I.A.,

17:14.839 --> 17:17.319
better than the internet,
better than the "Enquirer."

17:17.359 --> 17:19.079
I'm better than all
of them put together.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.599
I've gathered
more intelligence

17:20.640 --> 17:22.359
than anyone
you've ever met.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.000
I'm better than
Deep Throat.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.960
Give me the fucking info.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.000
Okay.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.800
The Six-Six-Sixers
are reforming

17:44.840 --> 17:47.000
in the City of Angels.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.600
The Deuce and Billy Wings
are back with a vengeance.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.920
Always pay your debts
to Billy Wings.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.920
Late last night a message
was sent to all hellraisers.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.080
It said The Deuce would
like life a lot better

18:18.120 --> 18:20.280
if he was living
in Victors territory.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.240
Give me something new,
will you?

18:23.280 --> 18:25.960
This whole
Deuce business

18:26.000 --> 18:30.240
has something
to do with 1976,

18:30.280 --> 18:34.080
something to do with
that Cherokee Kisum woman.

18:36.280 --> 18:39.720
That's all I wanted to hear.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.320
Now we fuck.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.120
Get much out of Opium yet?

19:09.160 --> 19:12.160
Yep. Flowing red in there,

19:12.200 --> 19:13.120
Blood Alley.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.640
What do you got so far?

19:14.680 --> 19:16.480
How much can you live with?

19:16.520 --> 19:19.080
I can stomach anything
I gotta stomach.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.360
Speed and Machete,
they're tied to The Deuce.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.160
Were. They're finito.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.520
Goody Two-Shoes
just called in.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.600
Speed and the Six-Six-Sixers,

19:28.640 --> 19:31.160
they set up the St. Louie
crack buy... with Opium.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.080
Six-Six-Sixers are
definitely coming at us.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.920
Deuce and Billy Wings
are coming.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.440
Meet me tomorrow in Tucson.

19:39.480 --> 19:43.280
Dani's Inferno. 3:00 P.M.
You got that?

19:43.315 --> 19:44.240
I got it.

20:11.160 --> 20:15.880
How much did The Deuce pay you
to set up St. Louie?

20:18.480 --> 20:20.040
Stand up.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.840
I'm sorry.
Please.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.520
Right from the start
I treated you like a son.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.120
Oh, well. Family
isn't everything.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.600
No.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.680
Where's The Deuce, Doc?

22:06.160 --> 22:07.760
And where's Pistolero?

22:13.400 --> 22:15.200
I guess I'm just
a fuckup, Billy.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.200
I guess you are.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.160
I guess I won't be needing
your services anymore.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.600
You're off the payroll,
Doc.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.285
# Might have been a time #

22:46.320 --> 22:48.840
# I needed your kiss
in the night #

22:48.880 --> 22:51.040
# Might have been a time #

22:51.080 --> 22:55.440
# The sound of your voice
made it right... #

22:55.480 --> 22:57.480
- Hello, Gigi.
- Hey.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.080
Tell Yvonne that the Victors are
gonna seize the V.I.P. table.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.360
Bring over some beer.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.680
If our beer don't kill you,

23:06.720 --> 23:08.640
it'll sure make you piss
stronger.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.880
I got the cowboy.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.200
# Now you've gone and cut
a whole new deal #

23:15.240 --> 23:17.360
# And it don't matter
how I feel #

23:17.400 --> 23:19.080
# Hell's bells... #

23:19.120 --> 23:20.440
Come on, bitch!

23:27.880 --> 23:29.240
Hi, Gent.

23:36.400 --> 23:41.240
How many of these horny little
devils you bang anyway?

23:41.280 --> 23:44.480
Yvonne, you snuck up
on me, didn't you?

23:44.520 --> 23:48.960
Gentlemen, this is Yvonne,
the future Mrs. Gent.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.240
We won't be shopping for
furniture anytime soon.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.880
What happened?

23:52.920 --> 23:56.480
You introduced Gigi as the
future Mrs. Gent last month.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.480
I forgot.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.480
To the next Mrs. Gent.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.400
Oh, and when you're done,

24:06.440 --> 24:08.360
come to my office.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.880
We're having a private party.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.640
I'm fuckin' there!
Right now!

24:12.680 --> 24:14.840
- These guys are animals.
- Why do we gotta wait?

24:24.280 --> 24:26.040
You're out!

24:26.080 --> 24:29.640
Pistolero kept his word.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.960
He made a vow
to the three B's:

24:33.000 --> 24:37.160
Bikes, Beer, and Booty.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.560
We could be rich, man,
you know?

24:40.600 --> 24:42.680
I'm talking about four B's:

24:42.720 --> 24:44.920
Bikes, Beer, Booty,

24:44.960 --> 24:48.320
and Big Bucks, man!

24:48.360 --> 24:51.240
That's actually
fuckin' five B's.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.720
There's a lot of dough
to be had out there.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.760
The Deuce, the Six-Six-Sixers,

24:58.800 --> 25:00.880
they're the fuckin' future.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.640
Pistolero...

25:02.680 --> 25:03.960
he needs to be ousted.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.280
All I know

25:07.320 --> 25:09.640
is I'd battle Satan
for Pistol.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.640
A little fuckin' redundant,
don't you think?

25:13.680 --> 25:15.960
You know what?
Fuck you.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.040
Fuck me?

25:18.080 --> 25:21.240
Fuck both you guys.
I'm headed in there right now

25:21.280 --> 25:23.160
and fuckin' wrestle
with those bitches!

25:23.200 --> 25:25.400
Hey!

25:25.440 --> 25:29.840
Well, fuck it. If I have to
help him I have to help.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.040
- Come on in.
- Oh, man!

25:40.080 --> 25:41.520
Shit! Yeah.

25:43.480 --> 25:46.280
Where's all them
oily pussies at?

25:49.320 --> 25:50.720
The oily bird
gets the worm.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.640
Meet me in Tucson
tomorrow at 6:00,

26:00.680 --> 26:02.640
Dani's Inferno.

27:17.920 --> 27:21.800
Ladies are not welcome
except on ladies' night.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.920
We got a sit-down
with the Sixers.

27:25.400 --> 27:29.800
Well, the fuckin' Sixers
ain't here.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.400
This better not be one
long ride for nothing.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.320
I gotta take a piss.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.000
Where's your head?

27:38.040 --> 27:42.680
The ladies room is closed
except for ladies' night.

27:52.840 --> 27:56.440
Now you got a.38
pointed at your head.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.920
You give me your colors,
you little pisser,

28:01.960 --> 28:05.120
or there's gonna be one
unvictorious Victor.

28:08.440 --> 28:11.200
What are you gonna do

28:11.240 --> 28:13.840
with these eight other
little pissers when I don't?

28:13.880 --> 28:17.200
I'm gonna wine 'em
and dine 'em.

28:17.235 --> 28:20.840
I'm gonna show them Paris.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.720
You ought to see how
I'm gonna buy them off.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.480
You know,

28:30.520 --> 28:33.720
you have to accept
the fact that

28:33.760 --> 28:38.080
the brotherhood of bikers
is bullshit.

28:38.120 --> 28:42.880
The three B's:
Bikers, Brotherhood, Bullshit.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.560
Do you ever do anything
but yack?

28:48.600 --> 28:50.960
You half-witty piss-poor
shit-wit nitwit?

28:52.200 --> 28:55.560
Take us to the fuckin' Sixers!

28:55.600 --> 28:58.640
Sure thing, man.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.520
Come on, no probleme.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.880
How long have you
had that bike?

29:09.920 --> 29:12.760
Since 1976.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.600
Follow me if you can!

30:06.280 --> 30:08.560
He's fucking with us, man.

30:08.600 --> 30:13.160
Relax. I know this desert
like the back of my hand.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.800
You just keep me
in sight.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.440
This guy's a fucking clown.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.360
Listen to me. We catch
that old motherfucker,

30:25.400 --> 30:27.760
let's whack that Injun
motherfucker too.

30:27.795 --> 30:29.560
We don't need him no more.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.600
I know whose side I'm on.
The Deuce.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.040
Fuckin' copacetic by me.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.360
I'm with you, man.
The Deuce, the Six-Six-Sixers,

30:37.400 --> 30:38.720
Billy Wings!

30:50.360 --> 30:54.560
Ladies shouldn't ride Indians
except on ladies' night!

30:58.440 --> 31:01.280
Now put your balls on ice.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.680
Let me get some info
out of him first,

31:04.720 --> 31:07.400
before we send him to
the Happy Hunting Grounds.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.160
I hope you got
insurance, old man.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.360
Be cool, Sonny Boy.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.240
Greetings
from Pistolero!

31:50.320 --> 31:54.240
Nobody said nothing to me about
nobody pissing on my boots!

31:54.280 --> 31:56.480
And I'm gonna tell
Johnny Pissed-Off

31:56.520 --> 31:58.760
that I'm lots more
pissed off than him.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.400
Comanche, meet Eddie Zero.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.200
Now gimme a hand with this,

32:26.240 --> 32:29.240
'cause I got things to go
and places to do. Come on.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.000
# If you can dream #

32:52.040 --> 32:55.720
# Dream of Maria #

32:59.160 --> 33:01.400
# If you can love, #

33:01.440 --> 33:05.960
# Then love Maria #

33:08.720 --> 33:11.400
# She'll be the one #

33:11.440 --> 33:15.480
# Who'll come to you #

33:18.120 --> 33:20.640
# When sunset turns #

33:20.680 --> 33:23.960
# To morning dew. #

33:36.360 --> 33:38.040
Perfect.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.960
Don't say that.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.480
The day that it's perfect

33:44.520 --> 33:45.880
is your last day on earth.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.400
Hell is gonna get a hell of a
lot worse from this point on.

34:00.360 --> 34:04.320
I think I finally found
Cherokee Kisum's boy.

34:04.360 --> 34:09.120
The ones who killed Cherokee
Kisum killed St. Louie too.

35:37.360 --> 35:38.520
The Gent.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.080
That's me.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.320
Pistolero would like to chat
with you and Comanche.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.800
Well thanks for the latest
breaking news, Wolf Blitzer.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.560
Dani's Inferno at 6:00.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.640
You stay off
the main highways.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.720
The Sixers are
cruising around.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.200
Listen, it's
dangerous as hell out here.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.400
How are you doing
weaponry-wise?

35:59.440 --> 36:02.680
What, are you some kind of
bike-to-bike salesman?

36:02.720 --> 36:06.680
I'm Eddie Zero, man.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.600
I thought Eddie Zero got killed
in a big-rig crash in '86.

36:09.640 --> 36:12.640
Yeah, I wish.

36:12.680 --> 36:16.920
Tell Pistolero that I need
to have a chat with him

36:16.960 --> 36:18.760
before the other chat

36:18.800 --> 36:23.520
about this asshole habit of
him concealing shit from me.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.920
Tell him your
fuckin' self, man.

36:26.160 --> 36:29.240
# She got the love
and admiration #

36:29.280 --> 36:31.200
# Of the Brotherhood Society #

36:31.240 --> 36:34.160
# Of South Napa County,
yeah #

36:34.200 --> 36:36.480
# She got the love
and admiration #

36:36.520 --> 36:38.640
# Of the Brotherhood Society #

36:38.680 --> 36:42.040
# Of South Napa County,
yeah... #

36:44.720 --> 36:47.040
My pussy's on fire!

36:49.480 --> 36:52.680
Your thoughtfulness
has given me the burning bush.

36:54.360 --> 36:57.960
Glad to have the fire marshal
arrive on the scene.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.600
Extinguish the fire,
Mr. Fire Chief.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.960
How 'bout we get that
fire hose out?

37:11.480 --> 37:13.360
Fire drill.
Mmm.

37:13.395 --> 37:14.880
Fireplug me.

37:14.920 --> 37:17.920
First the fire chief takes
a ride into the desert.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.280
Then I put out the fire.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.280
What kind of
fire department is this?

37:22.320 --> 37:23.640
Fire resistant.

37:23.680 --> 37:26.040
Fire retardant
if you ask me.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.760
You ain't the only
fire truck in town.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.480
Maybe I got
fire insurance.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.720
That kind of talk won't
get you anywhere with me.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.480
I'm fireproof.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.960
Did you bring the peyote?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.080
I got some thinking to do.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.480
Here's a little
reading material.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.360
That's a lot of trees, baby.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.120
666 pages.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.640
Maybe when I get back,

38:03.680 --> 38:07.000
your fire boy might do a little
professional fire eating.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.160
Now you're talking,
Mr. Fire Boy.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.040
I know you'll keep
your word, baby.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.560
Safe keep the treasure

39:48.595 --> 39:50.480
for my boy.

40:18.480 --> 40:21.560
Portable Pistolero!

40:23.520 --> 40:25.920
Your asshole behavior
looks good all written down.

40:25.960 --> 40:29.600
It's existential
but sexy.

40:29.640 --> 40:32.760
It's sexistential.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.600
And it's not just
the peyote talking.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.360
Let's get
the fireworks started.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.680
I gotta be
moving on.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.605
It's done... finito.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.640
Do whatever you want
with it when I'm dead.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.920
It's your annuity.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.040
Now I want you
to drop those pants,

40:49.075 --> 40:51.120
sit back, relax
and watch my tongue

40:51.160 --> 40:53.360
fight fire with fire.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.280
Can we have a little
fireside chat

40:55.320 --> 40:57.200
after you're done
tonguing me?

40:57.240 --> 40:59.440
How's about we have
the little fireside chat

40:59.480 --> 41:00.880
while I'm
tonguing you?

41:00.920 --> 41:02.800
We'll kill two birds
with one tongue.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.000
Are you 86-ing me?

41:05.040 --> 41:07.120
You're not a pussy eater.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.320
You never ate my pussy,
not once.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.320
Why all of a sudden?

41:14.120 --> 41:17.160
Nobody dumps me.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.680
I'm the one that does
the 86-ing!

41:24.440 --> 41:26.360
You fucking need to get
that Cherokee Kisum

41:26.400 --> 41:29.280
out of your gut
once and for all!

41:30.440 --> 41:33.200
Oh, Jesus!

41:38.560 --> 41:40.560
Puta madre.

41:43.120 --> 41:46.800
Bury me
near St. Louie

41:46.840 --> 41:49.520
at the cactus flower.

41:49.560 --> 41:53.040
Safe keep the treasure
for the boy.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.280
Can I get you
anything, Deuce?

42:11.315 --> 42:13.320
No no.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.760
# I'm going traveling #

42:29.800 --> 42:32.280
# I'm a traveling man #

42:32.320 --> 42:34.760
# Stay with me, baby #

42:34.800 --> 42:37.120
# If you think
you can #

42:37.160 --> 42:38.960
# Well, I don't know
where now #

42:39.000 --> 42:41.760
# But I've got to go #

42:41.800 --> 42:44.040
# I've got a need
inside me #

42:44.080 --> 42:46.480
# That ever
tells me so #

42:46.515 --> 42:48.440
# I got to ride now #

42:48.480 --> 42:51.040
# I'm a traveling man #

42:51.080 --> 42:53.560
# I'm gonna
ride ride ride #

42:53.600 --> 42:55.760
# Like I know I can #

42:55.800 --> 42:57.960
# I'm gonna
ride ride ride #

42:58.000 --> 42:59.920
# I'm a traveling man. #

43:08.120 --> 43:10.280
You must be The Gent.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.920
What tipped you off,

43:12.960 --> 43:15.440
the outfit?

43:15.480 --> 43:17.920
I'm known as Dani
around these parts.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.000
I'm a friend
of Pistolero's.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.680
Is that a fact?

43:22.720 --> 43:25.800
Kind of a dangerous thing
to be nowadays, isn't it?

43:30.480 --> 43:33.480
What's your pleasure,

43:33.520 --> 43:34.760
booze wise?

43:34.800 --> 43:37.320
What's your nationality?

43:37.360 --> 43:39.800
Born in the U.S. of A.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.560
I'm part Irish,

43:41.600 --> 43:43.960
part Italian,
part Arapaho.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.240
I'm an Irishian-hoe.

43:47.280 --> 43:51.040
I must say,
God bless America.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.680
And God damn it,
I'll have an American beer.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.000
You got it.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.120
What a country.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.880
Thank you.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.920
What should we drink to?
Christopher Columbus.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.560
To Amerigo Vespucci.

44:14.760 --> 44:16.440
Hey!

44:16.480 --> 44:18.080
Why'd you fly the coop?

44:18.120 --> 44:20.920
That wasn't part
of the fucking plan.

44:20.960 --> 44:23.840
We were supposed to talk
to Pistolero together

44:23.880 --> 44:26.840
after he got done
fucking.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.920
It would be a whole lot
easier to explain

44:28.960 --> 44:31.000
of you didn't have that gun
pointed at my face.

44:47.480 --> 44:51.160
My life used to be
a bike-and-booty epic.

44:51.200 --> 44:53.720
Because of you
and Pistolero

44:53.760 --> 44:56.840
it's turned into a goddamn whopper
of a chopper opera.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.320
Well, if you'd like,

44:58.360 --> 45:00.760
I can turn your life
into an operetta.

45:08.040 --> 45:10.000
Why'd you hit me
with that bottle?

45:18.280 --> 45:20.440
How many of these
do you got?

45:20.480 --> 45:22.360
Just one.

45:22.400 --> 45:24.400
And I just
used it up.

45:24.440 --> 45:25.920
Yes, you did, son.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.600
Open a beer.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.520
What do you got?

45:32.560 --> 45:33.840
What do you want?

45:33.880 --> 45:35.120
Around here

45:35.160 --> 45:37.600
we drink
American beer.

45:51.480 --> 45:52.960
American it is then.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.400
I want to make a suggestion
where you can stick all your sticks.

46:07.440 --> 46:08.760
Nobody's gonna
stop you.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.480
What the fuck?

46:10.520 --> 46:13.040
Implementing a plan
to save the day?

46:13.080 --> 46:15.240
All you've been doing
is running around

46:15.280 --> 46:17.880
collecting girls' phone numbers.
Come on, motherfucker!

46:36.440 --> 46:40.000
Go easy.
Apache uprising.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.960
A medicine woman
saved my life

46:42.000 --> 46:44.880
after she
almost killed me.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.160
- Beer?
- Yeah.

46:47.200 --> 46:48.720
All right.

46:55.240 --> 46:58.120
Which asshole
are you betting on?

46:58.160 --> 47:00.000
I'm betting
you're a bigger asshole

47:00.040 --> 47:02.320
than the two of them
put together.

47:02.360 --> 47:03.680
I'll drink to that.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.000
To the President
of Assholes.

47:08.360 --> 47:10.640
It took me years
to figure out

47:10.680 --> 47:13.760
if you were a good guy
or a bad guy.

47:13.800 --> 47:16.280
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

47:16.320 --> 47:19.120
It's how come
I'm the pres.

47:22.280 --> 47:24.160
I'm gonna kill
the two of you

47:24.200 --> 47:26.080
as soon as you
wear yourselves out

47:26.120 --> 47:28.920
a little bit more.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.560
Rope-a-dopes.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.040
Hell, my life
used to be

47:42.080 --> 47:46.320
one long biker party.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.400
where all the pussy
was wide open

47:48.440 --> 47:51.360
and the whiskey
was flowing.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.720
Now it seems my life
has turned into

47:54.760 --> 47:58.480
some kind
of a cycle symphony,

47:58.520 --> 48:03.520
a symphony
in 666 movements,

48:03.560 --> 48:07.880
a 666cc
cycle symphony

48:07.920 --> 48:09.280
with no intermezzos...

48:09.320 --> 48:12.040
Shut the fuck up!

48:13.360 --> 48:17.760
What the hell were you
two assholes thinking?

48:17.800 --> 48:20.800
Dani, can I be alone
with my two assholes?

48:25.960 --> 48:29.640
No Victor
does any business

48:29.680 --> 48:32.840
without getting
the go-ahead from me first.

48:32.880 --> 48:36.120
You told us
to never ever bother you

48:36.160 --> 48:38.400
when you were fucking.

48:38.440 --> 48:42.000
I had everything covered.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.360
Infiltrators, rats,

48:44.400 --> 48:47.240
Benedict Arnolds
up the ass.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.880
I had us covered.

48:48.920 --> 48:51.200
You had you covered!

48:51.240 --> 48:53.600
And God damn it,
I rue the day

48:53.640 --> 48:55.840
that I became a Victor.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.560
And I rue the day
that I brought Bix in.

48:58.600 --> 49:02.040
You didn't bring Bix in.
He suckered you

49:02.080 --> 49:04.480
into introducing him
to me.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.360
Nobody likes
to be suckered.

49:14.400 --> 49:17.760
Hey, go easy on him.

49:26.360 --> 49:30.000
- I actually felt that one.
- Good.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.920
We got some serious
hell-fighting to do

49:31.960 --> 49:33.800
with Billy Wings.

49:33.840 --> 49:35.920
You in or out?

49:35.960 --> 49:39.080
Oh, I don't know.
I could go either way.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.560
Which way
is it gonna be?

49:40.600 --> 49:42.680
Eenie meenie
miney moe.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.600
I'm in.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.120
Good.

49:47.160 --> 49:49.800
I'm holding two aces.

49:49.840 --> 49:52.080
I'm holding two aces
and one Deuce.

49:52.120 --> 49:55.120
I'm holding one Deuce
at the Inn 6

49:55.160 --> 49:57.440
off route 66.

49:57.480 --> 49:59.640
I had it covered.

49:59.680 --> 50:03.520
I had it all
fucking covered.

50:03.560 --> 50:07.280
I want you to meet me
at Inn 6, route 66,

50:07.320 --> 50:09.000
tomorrow morning
at 6:00 A.M.

50:09.040 --> 50:10.240
Think you can
remember that?

50:10.280 --> 50:12.160
Are you gonna tell me
six more times?

50:12.200 --> 50:14.320
A child of six
could remember that.

50:33.360 --> 50:37.040
# We all want
to prepare you #

50:39.040 --> 50:43.120
# The unbelievable
is going to happen #

50:44.640 --> 50:46.880
# It will linger
in your mind #

50:46.920 --> 50:50.160
# Forever #

50:50.200 --> 50:52.560
# Let this carry you
wherever #

50:52.600 --> 50:55.680
# Wherever #

50:55.720 --> 50:58.560
# Triggering #

50:58.600 --> 51:00.960
# The unconscious
power... #

51:01.000 --> 51:05.400
Hey, what do those
white wings mean?

51:05.440 --> 51:08.440
They're for licking
virgin pussy.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.480
The red wings

51:14.520 --> 51:16.240
are for licking
a bleeding pussy.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.280
See that?

51:18.320 --> 51:20.200
The blue-and-yellow wings

51:20.240 --> 51:22.360
are for licking
a policewoman.

51:22.400 --> 51:25.040
The blue-and-yellow-
on-brown wings...

51:25.080 --> 51:28.360
they're for licking
a policewoman's asshole.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.120
The green wings are for licking
a pussy with crabs.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.920
The purple wings...

51:35.000 --> 51:37.360
they're for licking
a dead pussy.

51:40.320 --> 51:42.200
See that?

51:42.240 --> 51:45.240
Pill-popping,
cunt-eating,

51:45.280 --> 51:48.360
dope-smoking
motherfucker.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.340
But you know,

51:50.375 --> 51:52.280
in a good way.

51:54.720 --> 51:57.000
Get out of here.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.520
Come here.

52:11.280 --> 52:15.320
Comanche, I want you
to meet Maria.

52:15.360 --> 52:17.480
Hello.

52:19.040 --> 52:22.800
Who the hell are you
and what the fuck is your story?

52:22.840 --> 52:27.280
I'm just a guy
named Comanche,

52:27.320 --> 52:29.840
a Victor

52:29.880 --> 52:32.560
named Comanche.
That's my story.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.720
Do you know anything
about a key?

52:34.760 --> 52:37.280
No.
Tell me about it.

52:41.880 --> 52:46.440
Do you know anything
about a safe-deposit box?

52:46.480 --> 52:48.800
No.

52:48.840 --> 52:51.080
Tell me about it.

52:58.360 --> 53:01.240
Ever heard
of Cherokee Kisum?

53:03.760 --> 53:07.360
I knew a Cherokee Indian
woman once.

53:08.760 --> 53:12.960
The Deuce did too,
from way back.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.880
When they
weren't busy

53:14.920 --> 53:17.200
leading the sexual
revolution

53:17.240 --> 53:19.240
they were busy
producing acid.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.560
They made a fortune
on the L.S.D. market,

53:21.600 --> 53:23.480
then coke.

53:23.520 --> 53:26.640
The only problem was,

53:26.680 --> 53:29.600
she was fucking over The Deuce
while she was fucking him.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.880
And let me tell you
something...

53:31.920 --> 53:34.880
she stashed away
one hell of a mint.

53:34.920 --> 53:39.040
On July 4th, 1976,

53:39.080 --> 53:42.840
she went up in flames.

53:42.880 --> 53:45.080
She had a boy.

53:45.120 --> 53:48.560
No one ever saw that boy
ever again.

53:52.920 --> 53:55.360
How do I know for sure
that you're you?

53:58.280 --> 54:01.000
Stand up.

54:17.480 --> 54:19.760
Hi, Deuce.
How are you?

54:21.680 --> 54:24.280
Hello, Johnny.

54:24.320 --> 54:26.880
It's been
many a moon.

54:34.240 --> 54:37.400
Mm-hmm.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.760
Thank you
for the suite, Johnny.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.680
You know,

54:42.720 --> 54:45.000
I hope I'm not
being unreasonable,

54:45.040 --> 54:49.240
but no mint on the pillow
again last night.

54:49.280 --> 54:51.640
No pillow,
in fact.

54:51.680 --> 54:54.040
You know, Johnny,

54:54.080 --> 54:55.960
mint hoarding

54:56.000 --> 54:58.360
is not good
for business.

54:58.400 --> 55:01.280
The key to a good
business relationship is

55:01.320 --> 55:03.400
everybody's happy.

55:03.440 --> 55:05.600
I'm not happy,
Johnny.

55:07.560 --> 55:10.480
That's a very
nice suit.

55:10.520 --> 55:13.800
Yeah, well,
it used to be

55:13.840 --> 55:16.480
before I was shanghaied
two nights ago.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.640
I thought you got killed
by a big rig back in '86.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.480
I ain't happy,
Johnny.

55:31.520 --> 55:35.120
Well, who is, Deuce?

55:35.160 --> 55:38.840
I mean,

55:38.880 --> 55:40.760
tell me if it's
none of my business,

55:40.800 --> 55:43.920
but I heard you did
a lot of traveling all these years.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.840
That's very true.

55:45.880 --> 55:48.880
Seeing America,
building an empire.

55:48.920 --> 55:50.800
It was right around

55:50.840 --> 55:53.440
the summer of '76,
I think,

55:53.480 --> 55:56.120
when you kind of

55:56.160 --> 55:59.320
86-ed yourself
from the Six-Six-Sixers.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.600
You know, Johnny,

56:01.640 --> 56:04.000
motorcycles are
big business,

56:04.040 --> 56:05.920
big business.

56:05.960 --> 56:08.280
I mean,
books, magazines,

56:08.320 --> 56:11.040
clothing,
customizing shops...

56:11.080 --> 56:14.480
so big that I finally
had to give up

56:14.520 --> 56:18.160
riding bikes
so I could concentrate

56:18.200 --> 56:20.360
on my motorcycle
business.

56:20.400 --> 56:23.880
I traveled all over
the United States...

56:23.920 --> 56:25.800
the Keystone State,

56:25.840 --> 56:29.080
the Treasure State,
the Show-Me State,

56:29.120 --> 56:31.640
setting up businesses.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.400
I decided
to come back here

56:33.440 --> 56:35.320
because...

56:35.360 --> 56:38.320
because I had some
unfinished business.

56:38.360 --> 56:40.080
Boy oh boy,
I don't know,

56:40.120 --> 56:42.760
I tell you, l...

56:42.800 --> 56:44.680
I don't know nothing

56:44.720 --> 56:46.960
about the Keystone State,

56:47.000 --> 56:51.200
the Treasure State
or the Show-Me State.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.120
I don't know.

56:53.160 --> 56:55.360
My business
has always been

56:55.400 --> 56:57.280
just kind of minding
my own business.

56:57.320 --> 56:59.040
So how is business?

56:59.080 --> 57:01.240
It's business
as usual.

57:01.280 --> 57:03.160
Good.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.720
Then can we
get down to business?

57:05.760 --> 57:08.080
Let's cut a deal.

57:08.120 --> 57:10.000
How's this?

57:10.040 --> 57:12.120
I get the Sixers
off your back

57:12.160 --> 57:14.720
and off
The Gent's back

57:14.760 --> 57:18.280
and you give me

57:18.320 --> 57:21.000
whatever you feel
I'm entitled to

57:21.040 --> 57:23.320
for services
rendered

57:23.360 --> 57:25.680
and everybody's happy,

57:25.720 --> 57:29.600
the three key points
of this deal being

57:29.640 --> 57:33.360
that I get deposited
back in L.A.

57:33.400 --> 57:35.600
with my entitlement,

57:35.640 --> 57:37.520
and you and The Gent

57:37.560 --> 57:39.440
get to die old men.

57:39.480 --> 57:42.840
Those would be the three
key points of this deal.

57:45.200 --> 57:47.760
I've had enough of you.

57:49.360 --> 57:53.160
Cut out the double talk.

57:54.560 --> 57:56.440
He doesn't know anything

57:56.480 --> 57:58.600
about a safe-deposit box
or a key.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.280
A key?

58:02.320 --> 58:07.400
What-what-what key
are you talking about?

58:07.440 --> 58:10.640
The key that Cherokee Kisum
had made.

58:10.680 --> 58:12.800
Who's Cherokee Kisum?

58:17.840 --> 58:19.520
Hmm?

58:19.560 --> 58:21.880
Cherokee Kisum was
the young woman

58:21.920 --> 58:24.400
you kept company with.

58:29.720 --> 58:31.800
The young woman
who was set on fire

58:31.840 --> 58:34.640
on July 4th, 1976.

58:49.120 --> 58:51.480
Billy Wings:
Deuce, she's gotta burn.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.520
Nothing, Johnny.

58:58.560 --> 59:01.040
I'm sorry,
I don't have

59:01.080 --> 59:02.960
any recollection
of any of this.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.800
It was quite
a long time ago.

59:05.840 --> 59:09.560
Can you recollect
setting St. Louie on fire

59:09.600 --> 59:11.840
a couple of nights ago?

59:11.880 --> 59:13.000
Huh.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.560
Deuce, I swear

59:18.600 --> 59:20.680
Pistolero never said
a fucking thing

59:20.720 --> 59:22.240
about any
safe-deposit box!

59:22.280 --> 59:24.720
No, Johnny.

59:24.760 --> 59:26.640
No memory of it
at all.

59:26.680 --> 59:30.160
But then I ain't
no Marcel Proust.

59:31.920 --> 59:36.560
You got any proof
of all this?

59:37.840 --> 59:40.040
Do I need
fucking proor?

59:40.080 --> 59:41.960
Well, you must need
something

59:42.000 --> 59:44.040
or I'd be dead already,
wouldn't I?

59:44.080 --> 59:46.440
The only reason
you're not dead is

59:46.480 --> 59:49.120
before I kill you
I wanted to ask Sonny Kisum

59:49.160 --> 59:51.960
if he'd like to cut off your head
before I do it.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.440
Hell, yes.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.920
I've waited
all of these years

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.880
to kill him
with you.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.520
I still got business
with Billy Wings.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.720
Partners in crime,
right?

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.120
I had Eddie Zero
trying to track down

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.760
Sonny Kisum for years.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.400
Maybe you would have
found Sonny Kisum

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.360
if your tracker wasn't
a 24-7 hash-head.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.120
No.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.840
No, in my opinion,
you don't find Sonny Kisum

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.240
until Sonny Kisum
wants to be found.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.720
I was just about
to say that.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.400
Cherokee Kisum

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.760
was one
wild-as-hell woman,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.240
a good woman

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.200
but wild.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.640
I gave her my word

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.920
if anything happened
to her

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.080
I'd safe keep the treasure
for her boy.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.800
Is it being
kept safer

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.800
than the safekeeping
of Cherokee Kisum was?

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.600
She wasn't looking to me
for safekeeping.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.720
I never knew what happened
the day she died

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.640
and couldn't find
anyone who did.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.160
It was a 36-carat-

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.080
diamond-studded,

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.600
solid gold riddle.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.640
Look, I'm an owl.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.880
Get out of here.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.040
In the basket.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.280
Ain't that Pistolero
one malevolent motherfucker?

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.720
Follow me
to Pistolero

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.880
if you can
stomach it.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.240
Well now,
the way I see it

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.440
I only got close to that treasure
once before

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.360
and I ain't gonna let
that motherfucker

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.360
fuck it up again
this time.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.000
Let's ride.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.280
Go home.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.880
It'll all amount
to nothing.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.240
Pistolero's coming here.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.080
Don't fuck up.
I need him alive.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.360
Hey, piker biker.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.920
Purple wings.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.480
Can you two stomach
which dead pussy

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.400
earned me
my purple wings?

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.720
Ain't nothing
you can do to me

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.240
I can't stomach.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.600
You ain't seen
nothing yet.

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:52.359
Give Comanche the two keys
you're holding.

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:54.600
Let him safe keep 'em
for a while.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:59.120
Give Comanche the two keys
you're holding.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.240
Let him safe keep 'em
for a while, God damn it.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.439
Take a peek at St. Louie.
See if he's resting in peace.

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:16.840
Look for
the cactus flower.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.359
You know, you should
lighten up on yourself.

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:30.000
When you fuck with The Deuce
you're gonna get burned by The Deuce.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.319
I met her before
she met The Deuce.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.200
I first met her
in 1969

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.479
through Eddie Zero.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.000
She was 16.
I was 14.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.359
Think about that one.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.680
Hey, you okay?

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.880
- Nada?
- Yes, sir.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.560
- Did you bring my jacket?
- Mm-hmm. Everything okay?

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.800
Oh, yeah.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.120
So how come
we'd never met before?

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.200
- I'm Eddie.
- I know, Eddie.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.960
You ever get tired
of faking your own death?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.960
You got a joint?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.720
I sure do.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.640
Baby.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.240
Hey, Kemo Sabe,
just how much was

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.760
in that box for us
from the Cherokee woman?

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.280
Us?

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.760
Us, yeah, like you and me.
Us, yeah.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.840
I knew it would
come to this... us.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.240
Well, I don't want
nothing from it.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.560
I'm only curious to know
how much is in there.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.360
You're just curious,

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.280
but you don't want
nothing from it.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.400
No, I don't.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.880
It's none of our business
what's in the box.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.800
So what you're
saying is

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.080
that the booty
in the box

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.560
that I've already said
that I don't want nothing from

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.200
is none
of my business?

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.880
Gent: So let me
get this straight...

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.720
the box and the booty
that's in it

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.920
which I've already said

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.320
that I don't want
nothing of

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.320
is none
of my business?

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.720
Butt out of the booty business,
in other words.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.200
Well, you're being
downright unfriendly now.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.800
Where's the cash
that Bob The Bum was holding

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.240
when he got
his throat slit?

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.400
Oh, well,
I'm holding on to that.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.800
I'm keeping it safe

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.160
'cause that's
my destiny.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.600
And maybe that's
none of your business.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.800
I think it's my business
to have in my hand right there.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.800
Listen, I don't want
to have to kill you.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.720
I want you
to hand over

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.680
Bob The Bum's cash
right now.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.760
Go ahead. Where do you want
to kill me, here?

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.920
You want to kill me
between the eyes?

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.400
Right between
the eyes, yeah.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.320
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.800
Put it right between my fucking eyes.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.880
Come on, go ahead.
You can do it.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.920
Come on.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.640
Eh...

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.480
I was counting on you
to do something

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.440
to stop this whole
fucking ridiculous thing.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.360
What the hell
made you think

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.680
you could count
on me?

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.600
What got into your
fucking brain?

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.320
Because I love you.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.840
Aw, hell.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.280
You did good, Sonny.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.400
I think I'm gonna
call you son from now on

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:25.360
'cause Sonny's eating up
way too much fucking time.

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.920
# Oh, see #

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.120
# See see, rider #

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.480
# I said, see #

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.680
# What you have
done now #

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.080
# Oh, see #

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.520
# See see, rider #

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.680
# I said, see #

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.040
# What you have
done now #

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.800
# Oh, you made me
love you #

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.920
# Now now now now
your man has gone #

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.800
# See see, rider #

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.880
- # Oh #
- # See see, rider #

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.000
# I'm going away now,
baby #

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.600
# And I won't be #

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.520
# Back no more, yeah #

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.120
# Oh, I'm going #

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.520
# Away now, baby #

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.760
# And I won't be #

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.080
# Back no more, yeah #

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.120
# If I find me
a good girl #

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.320
- # I won't be back at all #
- # See see, rider #

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.320
- # All right #
- # See see, rider. #

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.840
# Mama told you
not to play by the fire #

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.640
# And now you've gone
and wrapped yourself in barbed wire #

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.560
# Every time
I see a red light #

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.440
# You say go #

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:17.320
# Sun is burning
on a hot summer day #

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.080
# I'm in a hurry, honey,
clear the way #

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.920
# Daddy still ain't home #

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.480
# With the babies crying #

# Mama's cooking up
rice and beans #

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.680
# While we're #

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.400
# Making mud pies
with gasoline #

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.840
# We're on
a hell ride #

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.640
# We're on a hell ride #

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.600
# Yeah #

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.360
# Mama's saddled
with a life degree #

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.560
# Working night and day,
10 mouths to feed #

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.200
# Mama's all alone #

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.160
# With the chickens
frying #

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.240
