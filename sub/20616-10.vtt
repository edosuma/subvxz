00:10.177 --> 00:13.612
There is a lot of
physical phenomena.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.081
There is a vortex here.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.316
It's just out of control.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.418
I'm getting attacked.

00:19.420 --> 00:24.522
She's, like, praying and crying
and praying and crying.

00:24.524 --> 00:28.093
I saw a dark figure
standing right there.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.528
They can kill
the living person here.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.664
He died instantly.

00:32.665 --> 00:37.636
It's not okay to be
in this location at all.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.771
This is not a good situation.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.873
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.208
There is death here.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.110
Don't want to go down there.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.478
I see dead people.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.513
They hide in the walls,
and they watch.

00:48.515 --> 00:51.249
I speak to dead people...

00:51.251 --> 00:53.886
She is definitely
a serial killer.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.520
...and they speak to me.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.090
She is going to torture them.

00:58.092 --> 01:01.593
But there is only one way
to know if my findings are real.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.662
They were all murdered.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.364
I rely on my partner.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.932
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.733
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.203
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:11.205 --> 01:15.240
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.944
There is no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.846
It's my job to reveal them.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.381
Who do you think possessed you?

01:22.383 --> 01:24.216
But Steve and I never speak...

01:24.218 --> 01:26.318
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.586
...until the very end.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.154
Well, you're not gonna
wanna see this.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.623
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:31.625 --> 01:33.058
Hell no.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.392
Or time to get out.

01:34.394 --> 01:36.762
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.311
I'm in the small town
of Elkview, West Virginia.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.813
It's about 15 miles
north of Charleston.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.882
I got a call from a mother
of two named Sara.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.885
Now, she says something
in her house is attacking her,

01:59.887 --> 02:01.320
scaring her kids,

02:01.322 --> 02:03.689
and she thinks someone
is gonna get hurt.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.091
She sounded really bad,
and I'm hoping Amy

02:06.093 --> 02:07.226
and I can help her out.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.164
Before Amy arrives,

02:13.166 --> 02:17.435
I clear the area of
any leading information.

02:17.437 --> 02:20.305
This house is filled
with family photos,

02:20.307 --> 02:22.774
so it's important that
I cover or remove them all.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.780
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.663
Boy. Boy. Boy.
Boy. Boy.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.431
There is at least
three time periods

02:46.433 --> 02:48.133
of different dead people here,

02:48.135 --> 02:49.601
and they're stuck
with each other,

02:49.603 --> 02:51.003
so they're always fighting.

02:51.005 --> 02:55.641
So it's kind of a mess.

02:55.643 --> 03:01.279
This location here is kind of
caught in the crosshairs

03:01.281 --> 03:05.384
of this crazy...

03:05.386 --> 03:07.719
It's really bad.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.031
You know, Sara, when we spoke
on the phone,

03:19.033 --> 03:20.198
you sounded terrified.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.867
What the hell's going on
in this house?

03:22.869 --> 03:25.570
I'm at my breaking point.

03:25.572 --> 03:29.574
The activity now
has got violent,

03:29.576 --> 03:31.309
and it's just out of control.

03:31.311 --> 03:32.577
I'm getting attacked.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.446
My boys are being scared.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.314
We need help.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.516
If something can't be done,

03:38.518 --> 03:41.920
it's gonna tear
my family apart.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.657
All right. So who exactly
lives in the house?

03:45.659 --> 03:49.127
Myself. We have my husband,
Mark, our youngest boy,

03:49.129 --> 03:54.065
Tanner, he's 10,
and we have Lane that is 13.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.034
All right, so how long have
you guys been living here?

03:56.036 --> 03:58.670
We bought the house in 2002.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.440
We had Tanner in 2006.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.809
By the time that he was 2,

04:03.811 --> 04:06.144
that's when we really
started noticing things

04:06.146 --> 04:08.013
going on that
we could not explain.

04:08.015 --> 04:11.282
- Do you think he caused it?
- Yes.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.819
Nothing happened here
until he was born.

04:14.821 --> 04:17.288
What type of experiences
are you guys having?

04:17.290 --> 04:19.457
We've heard voices.

04:19.459 --> 04:23.094
We have seen things
move on their own.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.631
We've seen shadow figures.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.699
We'll have nightmares,

04:27.701 --> 04:31.036
and it's finally
getting physical.

04:31.038 --> 04:34.640
We are...scared.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.108
Now, is everybody in the house
being affected?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.410
To some degree.

04:38.412 --> 04:42.247
But it seems like
I'm the one that's seeing

04:42.249 --> 04:45.617
and hearing
the majority of it.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.385
So why don't you just move?

04:47.387 --> 04:49.254
We just really love this place,

04:49.256 --> 04:52.090
and I want to fight
for what's ours.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.732
Something going on here.

05:00.734 --> 05:05.270
There is a vortex here,
but it's huge.

05:05.272 --> 05:09.641
It's massive.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.679
Dead people can come and go
through it, also beings,

05:13.681 --> 05:16.815
entities, like, things
that have never been human.

05:16.817 --> 05:22.621
It's very concentrated
energy, very focused.

05:22.623 --> 05:27.559
This is too much energy for
living people to be exposed to.

05:27.561 --> 05:31.496
Being near this vortex
can cause a lot

05:31.498 --> 05:35.300
of physical issues
with the living.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.435
You're not gonna be
able to sleep here.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.038
You're gonna have...
insane dreams here.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.706
You're gonna lose time here.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.408
You're gonna see crazy...

05:44.410 --> 05:48.313
It's not okay to be
in this location at all.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.623
What's going on down here?

05:58.625 --> 06:03.929
I was down here one day,
and I go to walk up the stairs.

06:03.931 --> 06:09.200
I see the bottom half of
an apparition as plain as day.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.869
Where were you
when you saw this?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.403
At the back door.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.372
Any chance it could've
been one of the kids?

06:14.374 --> 06:16.074
They were upstairs.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.678
After I saw the apparition,
I got this intense pain.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.882
It felt like lightning had went
from my head to my toes.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.216
All right. So what else?

06:25.218 --> 06:29.720
I have heard, say, two people
having a conversation,

06:29.722 --> 06:31.823
whispering, almost like
they didn't want me

06:31.825 --> 06:33.391
to hear what they were saying.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.293
Does it sound like
it's a man and a woman,

06:35.295 --> 06:36.828
a couple of men,
couple of women?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.897
It varies. I've heard all.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.165
Could the TV be on upstairs,

06:41.167 --> 06:42.267
and it's just filtering
down into --

06:42.269 --> 06:44.302
There is no television
on at these times.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.637
This was late at night.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.173
We don't leave TVs on.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.674
Okay.
What else is going on?

06:49.676 --> 06:51.910
One night, it was, like,

06:51.912 --> 06:55.881
someone was shaking
the door violently.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.315
Could somebody have
gotten into the garage?

06:57.317 --> 07:00.552
That was my first thought,
and I was ready to call 9-1-1.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.086
Did you investigate it?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.622
I actually was too scared.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.596
Wow.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.732
There's Native Americans.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.802
This is theirs, man.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.536
I honestly thought
they were all men,

07:18.538 --> 07:20.672
but I'm seeing all of these
Native American women

07:20.674 --> 07:22.641
here with children.

07:22.643 --> 07:26.010
I think that the living would
have experiences of feeling,

07:26.012 --> 07:31.015
like, back it up.

07:31.017 --> 07:34.686
I think that the living

07:34.688 --> 07:37.289
would have a hard time

07:37.291 --> 07:39.758
being down here for very long.

07:39.760 --> 07:44.229
They would definitely
have experiences,

07:44.231 --> 07:46.698
hearing children
laughing and playing,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.834
hearing women's voices.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.768
There is a lot of
physical phenomena.

07:54.274 --> 07:59.610
The Native Americans are
constantly, like, moving things.

07:59.612 --> 08:03.381
They don't want anything
down here or person,

08:03.383 --> 08:05.450
and it really
bothers them, you know?

08:05.452 --> 08:06.451
They want it all out.

08:12.859 --> 08:15.760
Okay. So what's going on?

08:15.762 --> 08:20.332
The other night, I had a dream
that there was a man

08:20.334 --> 08:22.200
that was chasing me

08:22.202 --> 08:24.168
down the stairs
with a knife.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.703
Okay. How often are you
having those?

08:25.705 --> 08:27.205
Several times a month.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.206
All right.
Listen, I have nightmares.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.174
Why is it paranormal for you?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.878
These nightmares have just
started this year

08:32.880 --> 08:35.746
when the activity
really started ramping up.

08:35.749 --> 08:39.284
And I've never had nightmares
like this before.

08:39.285 --> 08:42.053
Okay. All right.
What else is going on in here?

08:42.054 --> 08:46.157
One night, I woke up
and there was just a shadow

08:46.159 --> 08:47.825
leaning over me.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.027
Where was the shadow?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.828
It was along that wall
right there.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.498
It couldn't have been somebody
outside casting a shadow.
No, no.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.767
At nighttime, I always
shut our blinds.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.836
Bad dreams.
Seeing shadow figures in here.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.171
What else is going on?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.107
There is times that
I've woke up, that it feels like

09:02.109 --> 09:03.942
I've been in a car accident.

09:03.944 --> 09:07.812
It feels like someone has taken
a baseball bat to my ribcage.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.615
Do you ever see
any markings from it?

09:10.617 --> 09:12.850
- We've taken some pictures.
- Okay.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.253
This is my calf.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.922
I mean, this is bad.
You know that.
Yeah.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.457
Anything else physical
like that ever happened?

09:19.459 --> 09:21.058
I'll go to bed feeling fine.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.927
I will wake up in the middle
of the night

09:22.929 --> 09:26.197
and have a migraine to where
it will make me so sick,

09:26.199 --> 09:28.066
to where I'll get nauseous,

09:28.068 --> 09:31.002
my head just feels like
somebody has just caved it in.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.737
How the hell are you
living like this?

09:32.739 --> 09:35.940
It's really scary sometimes.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.076
And I'm just trying
to get through it,

09:38.078 --> 09:41.012
make everything
okay for my boys,

09:41.014 --> 09:44.683
my husband and just
try to block it out.

09:49.022 --> 09:53.691
I see a woman here
with straight dark hair.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.159
Is this a living person?

09:55.161 --> 09:58.096
I think it's a living person.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.833
I feel like she's being
beat up, like,

10:01.835 --> 10:05.036
physically assaulted
by a dead male.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.943
She's, like, praying and crying
and praying and crying.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.880
This person in here
is sick already

10:15.882 --> 10:20.018
and is sicker
because of living here

10:20.020 --> 10:23.521
because it's such a bad
place to be physically.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.577
- So, Lane, how old are you?
- I'm 13.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.912
So I was talking to mom.

10:47.914 --> 10:51.049
She says things in the house
are pretty scary.
Yes.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.550
Are you having trouble
sleeping here?

10:52.552 --> 10:53.885
I've had nightmares in here,

10:53.887 --> 10:56.654
and that's caused me
to not sleep.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.357
So, Lane, what have you seen
that you can't explain?

10:59.359 --> 11:03.394
Downstairs, I saw the rocking
chair rocking by itself.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.129
Now, Lane, is it possible
one of your dogs

11:05.131 --> 11:07.465
might have ran by
the chair and hit it?

11:07.467 --> 11:09.000
No, because it's only happened

11:09.002 --> 11:10.734
whenever I'm down
there long.

11:10.736 --> 11:11.802
Okay. What else?

11:11.804 --> 11:14.539
One time, I saw a dark
figure standing

11:14.541 --> 11:17.075
right there looking at me
through the doorway.

11:17.077 --> 11:20.344
It scared me so bad, my heart
just, like, leapt out of me.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.880
So what did you see?
What did it look like?

11:21.882 --> 11:23.414
Like a man.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.817
It was, like,
darker than the room.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.286
Do you think what's here
could be dangerous?

11:28.288 --> 11:30.655
Yeah.

11:30.657 --> 11:31.923
Boy.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.091
I'm seeing a group of men.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.627
They look weird.

11:35.629 --> 11:38.029
They're dressed up
like pirates or bandits.

11:38.031 --> 11:42.767
It makes them look
really creepy,

11:42.769 --> 11:47.505
but they're all in shadow except
their eyes are white, like,

11:47.507 --> 11:50.041
this intense,
bright, white light

11:50.043 --> 11:54.445
comes out of their eyes
and puts them into shadow.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.447
Living people here
are seeing them.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.684
They wake up at night,
and they're being stared at.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.119
Very scary.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.093
Mark, talking to your wife,
she said that the activity

12:09.095 --> 12:10.528
kind of started

12:10.530 --> 12:12.963
maybe two years after
your youngest son was born.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.965
I mean, did that
make sense to you?

12:14.967 --> 12:16.134
Yes.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.336
There is something going on
with the youngest.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.205
Any experiences you could
tell me about?

12:20.207 --> 12:21.606
Absolutely. Yeah.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.876
We were all down
in the kitchen.
Okay.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.011
And there was this
real loud beep.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.513
It was really, I mean, you know,
it made your ears ring.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.282
Now, Mark, smoke detectors
make that noise

12:31.284 --> 12:33.284
when the battery
is starting to go.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.519
Was that the case here?

12:34.521 --> 12:38.556
I searched everything down
there, I mean, everything.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.824
There was nothing.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.993
Nothing logical
could explain it.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.427
Okay. Anything else happen?

12:43.429 --> 12:47.064
One time, I came in and fell
asleep on the love seat

12:47.066 --> 12:48.833
and had my head back.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.202
And it just felt like
somebody grabbed my jaw

12:51.204 --> 12:52.704
and slammed it shut.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.772
- You sure it wasn't a dream?
- Yeah.

12:54.774 --> 12:59.444
And then afterward,
the bottom of my chin tingled

12:59.446 --> 13:01.079
and then my teeth
started hurting.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.848
I'm like, "Holy crap."
I mean, it hurt my teeth.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.051
Working with Amy, knowing that
things are really physical here,

13:07.053 --> 13:10.088
this is not a good thing.
- Yeah.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.923
I worry every day, especially
when I'm out of town.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.491
It's tough.

13:13.493 --> 13:17.128
I'm really worried about
the boys being mentally scarred.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.000
These pirate bandit people

13:22.002 --> 13:25.636
are causing a lot
of stress for the living.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.406
One of them tried to talk to me.

13:28.408 --> 13:33.310
It made this weird noise.

13:33.312 --> 13:37.215
I've seen them, like,
creeping up on a male here

13:37.217 --> 13:39.116
as he's going up these stairs,

13:39.118 --> 13:41.219
and there's a little dead guy

13:41.221 --> 13:44.355
jumping on this
living dude's back.

13:44.357 --> 13:48.293
This living guy just explodes.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.761
He's feeling choked.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.896
He's feeling like the wind's
being knocked out of him.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.064
He's feeling pushed.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.199
A lot of really
brutal experiences.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.741
- Tanner, how old are you?
-10.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.109
So, Tanner, when I was
talking to your mom today,

14:05.111 --> 14:06.778
she told me that you were
having a tough time

14:06.780 --> 14:08.513
with the activity in the house.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.482
- Does that sound right to you?
- Yeah.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.384
Any experiences
you could tell me about?

14:13.386 --> 14:17.622
In the TV room,
the ceiling fan light,

14:17.624 --> 14:23.161
it was off then
it flickered on by itself.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.496
- That kind of scared you.
- Yeah.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.764
Anything else?

14:26.766 --> 14:30.067
I had a headache that

14:30.069 --> 14:34.739
progressively got stronger.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.542
And you think this was caused
by the paranormal?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.010
Yeah.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.812
Did you have them ever again?

14:40.814 --> 14:41.879
Yes.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.681
Your mom mentioned
she gets headaches.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.749
You ever been around mom
when she got them?

14:45.751 --> 14:46.684
Yeah.

14:46.686 --> 14:50.288
I got them the same time
as she did.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.223
If things are so bad here
for everybody else

14:52.225 --> 14:55.893
and they've got to move,
would you be okay with that?

14:55.895 --> 14:56.895
Yeah.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.568
There is about
two or three women here.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.636
I think they're whores.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.372
I guess they probably had
Syphilis, I'm thinking.

15:08.374 --> 15:09.640
They're rotting.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.576
One of them doesn't
have a nose, you know?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.378
The other one is, like,
missing, you know,

15:13.380 --> 15:15.679
pretty much her whole face.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.548
And they look scarier than...

15:23.056 --> 15:24.889
You know if they interact with

15:24.891 --> 15:26.090
the living in any way?

15:26.092 --> 15:30.194
These whores are pulling
memories out.

15:30.196 --> 15:31.863
I think that the living
have headaches from that,

15:31.865 --> 15:33.865
and I think that they have
nightmares from that.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.533
It's very unhealthy.

15:41.207 --> 15:45.376
They like this room.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.613
They're attracted to this
living person here

15:48.615 --> 15:51.549
'cause they're
a physical medium.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.952
These whores think that this
person has been neglected.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.289
They basically want
to adopt this person.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.158
- Is this person in danger?
- Yeah.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.094
The whores have been
attached to this person

16:03.096 --> 16:05.262
for their whole life
and make bad...

16:05.264 --> 16:10.301
happen, and they can kill
the living person here.

16:22.699 --> 16:26.801
Look, Elkview is a tiny town,
barely over 1,200 people.

16:26.803 --> 16:28.469
So when I made my usual calls,

16:28.471 --> 16:31.439
just about everyone knew
Sara and Mark's property.

16:31.441 --> 16:33.307
I'm heading over to meet
with an archivist who says,

16:33.309 --> 16:34.809
one of the original owners

16:34.811 --> 16:36.711
suffered a lot
of tragedies there.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.617
Now, Matt, you mentioned
on the phone

16:43.619 --> 16:45.386
that the Pauley family
suffered some tragedies

16:45.388 --> 16:47.255
while they were on
my clients' property.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.089
When did they get
my clients' property?

16:49.091 --> 16:52.827
Daniel Pauley bought your
clients' property in about 1858.

16:52.829 --> 16:54.762
So how much property
did he have?

16:54.764 --> 16:57.898
Well, he purchased 670 acres.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.333
Wow.

16:59.335 --> 17:01.602
Does he move on the property
right then and there?
Yes. Yes.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.270
He and his wife, Cinthya,
and their eight children,

17:03.272 --> 17:06.207
they moved their immediately
and built a house.

17:06.209 --> 17:08.675
You mentioned on the phone,
there were some deaths

17:08.678 --> 17:10.911
in regards to the family.
What happened?

17:10.913 --> 17:13.748
Cinthya gives birth to
a baby boy named Benjamin.

17:13.750 --> 17:18.018
But unfortunately, Benjamin dies
when he's only 4 months old.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.287
4 months?

17:19.289 --> 17:21.089
Yeah, same year they move
onto the property.

17:21.090 --> 17:22.490
This is the death record of it?

17:22.492 --> 17:24.090
- That's right.
- What happens after that?

17:24.093 --> 17:25.259
Several years later,

17:25.261 --> 17:27.328
the American Civil War is
going on.

17:27.329 --> 17:30.631
Daniel goes off
to fight for the North.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.499
I mean, how old is
he at this point?
He's 50.

17:32.501 --> 17:34.368
All right.
So let me get this straight.

17:34.370 --> 17:36.304
The guy's 50,
joins the Union Army.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.438
That's correct.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.973
And we do know that the company
he served in lost

17:39.975 --> 17:43.711
about 200 men to disease,
probably dysentery.

17:43.713 --> 17:45.780
And a lot of that was due
to the, you know,

17:45.782 --> 17:48.182
the sanitation conditions.

17:48.184 --> 17:51.051
So in these camps, it just was
not a very healthy place to be.

17:51.053 --> 17:55.990
And that's
a horrible way to go.
Yes.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.126
I'm seeing that
group of bandits,

17:58.128 --> 18:01.495
and they don't look good.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.464
They all got sick,
and they all died

18:03.466 --> 18:06.500
horrible deaths
from this illness.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.203
And they are damned
to wander here.

18:12.775 --> 18:15.509
The leader of these bandits

18:15.511 --> 18:19.413
is a colonial rogue soldier.

18:19.415 --> 18:20.948
So can you describe this guy?

18:20.950 --> 18:24.685
He looks to be in his 40s,
I would guess,

18:24.687 --> 18:27.154
very tall and he had on this

18:27.156 --> 18:31.526
very rich velvet blue

18:31.528 --> 18:33.360
Military jacket.

18:33.362 --> 18:37.098
He was in the military,
and I believe he went rogue.

18:42.505 --> 18:44.105
How does it go for him
after that?

18:44.107 --> 18:46.574
He's able to come home
to Cinthya and the children

18:46.576 --> 18:50.278
unscathed at the end
of the war in 1865.

18:50.280 --> 18:55.783
As time wears on, though,
on October 5, 1888, he dies.

18:55.785 --> 18:57.051
- Do we know how old he was?
- Yes.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.253
He was 73 years old.

18:59.255 --> 19:01.521
Okay.
What are we thinking, stroke?

19:01.523 --> 19:03.790
More than likely a stroke.

19:03.792 --> 19:04.925
All right.
So Daniel is dead.

19:04.927 --> 19:06.294
Does Cinthya remain
on the property?

19:06.296 --> 19:08.462
She does, and she
winds up dying in

19:08.464 --> 19:11.131
February of 1890
when she's 72.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.334
- And on my clients' property?
- That's correct.

19:13.336 --> 19:14.802
What happens with the property?

19:14.804 --> 19:17.804
Well, it stays in the family
and it is Daniel's grandson,

19:17.806 --> 19:20.541
George, who actually
buys the property.

19:20.543 --> 19:25.412
In 1894, he and his wife
have a young son named Romey

19:25.414 --> 19:28.482
who dies before
he's even a year old.

19:28.484 --> 19:29.884
What happens after that?

19:29.886 --> 19:32.820
Well, George actually
is the final chapter

19:32.822 --> 19:34.889
of the Pauley tragedies.

19:34.891 --> 19:37.824
In 1906, when he's
only 36 years old,

19:37.826 --> 19:41.428
he dies very quickly,
very mysteriously.

19:41.430 --> 19:46.500
All we have to go on
is his obituary.

19:46.502 --> 19:48.569
So we don't know if it was
an accident, illness.

19:48.571 --> 19:50.471
It doesn't tell us
what happened to him.

19:50.473 --> 19:52.473
But we do know
it was very unexpected.

19:55.712 --> 19:58.145
I think there are so many
dead people here

19:58.147 --> 20:01.115
because of the vortex.

20:01.117 --> 20:04.986
Dead people can come
and go through it, also beings,

20:04.988 --> 20:07.688
entities, like, things
that have never been human.

20:07.690 --> 20:11.325
They can come and go through it.

20:11.327 --> 20:14.395
And how would the living
be affected by the vortex?

20:14.397 --> 20:16.597
They would feel anxious.

20:16.599 --> 20:19.500
They would have
equilibrium issues.

20:19.502 --> 20:23.203
It could cause
long-term illnesses,

20:23.205 --> 20:25.872
also neurological damage.

20:25.874 --> 20:28.676
This thing is really dangerous.

20:28.678 --> 20:30.745
I think that it can kill people.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.318
A local EMT just called me.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.021
Now, he says Elkview has been
completely flooded

20:40.023 --> 20:41.789
several times.

20:41.791 --> 20:44.558
It turns out, one of the most
recent ones was deadly,

20:44.560 --> 20:45.960
and one of the victims died

20:45.962 --> 20:47.361
right near
Mark and Sara's house.

20:54.903 --> 20:55.902
Now, Tim,
thanks for meeting me.

20:55.904 --> 20:58.339
I really appreciate that.

20:58.341 --> 21:01.041
You mentioned on the phone that
one of my clients' neighbors

21:01.043 --> 21:03.577
perished during this big flood.
What happened?

21:03.579 --> 21:05.512
Little Sandy Creek
runs along the property

21:05.514 --> 21:07.448
that you're investigating.

21:07.450 --> 21:11.218
In June of 1998, a big powerful
storm hit the Elkview area.

21:11.220 --> 21:13.054
Okay. So how bad did it get?

21:13.056 --> 21:16.057
Ä°t got pretty deep, and it
destroyed a lot of property

21:16.059 --> 21:17.558
and took some lives.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.927
Wow. All right.

21:19.929 --> 21:21.795
So obviously, the water rose.

21:21.797 --> 21:24.265
What were the flood levels
at my clients' property?

21:24.267 --> 21:27.101
Wow.
It got really high.
Okay.

21:27.103 --> 21:28.669
So what do we know
about the poor guy

21:28.671 --> 21:30.071
that died in this flood?

21:30.073 --> 21:32.406
Well, Mr. Richard Varium, he was
an 83-year-old guy that lived

21:32.408 --> 21:33.607
about 1,000 feet from
the property

21:33.609 --> 21:34.942
you're investigating.

21:34.944 --> 21:37.010
I have a picture of Mr. Varium
when he was younger.

21:37.012 --> 21:41.148
He had been living alone
for quite a while.

21:41.150 --> 21:44.852
He was bound to a wheelchair
and also blind.

21:44.854 --> 21:46.887
He was in a bad situation.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.322
What happened?

21:48.324 --> 21:51.525
Family tried to get him out,
and they got him to the porch

21:51.527 --> 21:53.861
and realized that the water
was too swift, muddy,

21:53.863 --> 21:56.097
with a lot of debris
and then went to get help.

21:56.099 --> 21:57.898
By the time they got back,

21:57.900 --> 22:00.100
he had washed away
along with the porch.

22:00.102 --> 22:02.502
And he was found
downstream about 1/4

22:02.504 --> 22:03.604
of a mile in some trees.

22:08.110 --> 22:13.747
There was something about
water issues here and flooding

22:13.749 --> 22:17.351
'cause I saw water
come down, like, a wall.

22:22.859 --> 22:25.859
These water issues
are due directly

22:25.861 --> 22:28.462
to the paranormal
phenomena here.

22:28.464 --> 22:31.065
That's not good.

22:31.067 --> 22:33.334
The problem here is the land.

22:33.336 --> 22:38.538
Exposure to the land
seems to trap the dead here

22:38.540 --> 22:43.143
or bring them back
to be trapped here.

22:48.317 --> 22:50.283
For more information
about the show

22:50.285 --> 22:52.887
and if you need us to

23:09.789 --> 23:11.889
So far, I've got a family
being tormented

23:11.891 --> 23:16.827
in their own home on a property
where at least five people died.

23:16.829 --> 23:20.264
But I want to see
if there is anything else.

23:20.266 --> 23:22.299
Searching through old records,

23:22.301 --> 23:25.402
I find an article about another
member of the Pauley family.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.439
It turns out he was murdered
right next to Sara

23:28.441 --> 23:31.175
and Mark's property.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.110
I'm heading over to meet
historian and old friend,

23:33.112 --> 23:34.711
Jim Casto.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.647
He's looked into
this case for me

23:36.649 --> 23:39.483
and says it's got all
the ingredients for violence --

23:39.485 --> 23:41.552
friendship, love, and betrayal.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.426
Well, Jim, it's good
to see you again.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.496
Now, the homicide, it happened
right near my clients' property,

23:52.498 --> 23:54.298
and it involved
one of the Pauleys.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.665
So what can you
tell me about it?

23:55.667 --> 23:59.536
The victim was 27-year-old
Clarence Pauley,

23:59.538 --> 24:02.439
and he and his wife
and his three kids lived

24:02.441 --> 24:04.775
just down the road
from the property.

24:04.777 --> 24:08.078
There is a photo of him
in his Navy uniform

24:08.080 --> 24:10.581
during his World War II service.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.849
Despite being a married man,

24:12.851 --> 24:15.286
Clarence was
conducting an affair

24:15.288 --> 24:18.255
with the wife
of his best friend,

24:18.257 --> 24:21.592
Arnold Eldgewick,
and her name was Mary.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.127
What happened with
the homicide?

24:23.129 --> 24:29.266
On the night of
May 27, 1947,

24:29.268 --> 24:32.403
Clarence drove Mary
to her sister's house,

24:32.405 --> 24:35.538
where she had been staying.
- Okay.

24:35.540 --> 24:39.977
What they didn't know was that
Arnold was there waiting on them

24:39.979 --> 24:43.981
in the dark, shotgun in hand.

24:43.983 --> 24:47.318
They pulled up.
Mary saw him standing there.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.719
She got out of the car.

24:48.721 --> 24:52.289
He fired a shotgun blast
to her but missed.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.525
She fled and went down the road.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.093
Clarence gets out of the car.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.595
But before he gets
out of the car,

24:57.597 --> 25:00.964
he picks up a heavy hammer
and he starts toward Arnold.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.733
The guy's got a shotgun,
and he grabs a hammer?

25:02.735 --> 25:04.802
- It seems odd.
- Yeah.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.904
Arnold fired again.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.706
This time, his shot
hit its mark.

25:09.708 --> 25:14.110
It pierced Clarence's chest
right into his heart.

25:14.112 --> 25:18.248
He died instantly.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.050
Okay.
So Arnold kills this guy.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.318
Do the cops arrest him?

25:21.320 --> 25:23.787
Well, they didn't have
to bother looking for him.

25:23.789 --> 25:27.491
He drove himself straight
to the county jail,

25:27.493 --> 25:30.394
turned himself in,
confessed what he had done.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.529
And when they asked
him why, he said,

25:32.531 --> 25:34.798
"I thought I had
done a good deed."

25:34.800 --> 25:38.402
Here is a mug shot taken
at the West Virginia prison.

25:38.404 --> 25:41.005
He's got psycho
written in his eyes.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.006
I can tell you that.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.340
- Absolutely.
- All right.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.275
So how much time
did he wind up getting?

25:45.277 --> 25:47.978
He served three years
in the West Virginia State Pen.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.915
He got away with pretty
much premeditated murder.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.215
So it would seem.

25:55.020 --> 26:00.958
Something happened where
this woman is freaking out.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.693
I'm hearing, like, men's voices
talking, yelling.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.902
Some jealousy issues,
I heard a gunshot.

26:15.041 --> 26:18.242
I'm getting just
a lot of sadness.

26:27.386 --> 26:30.387
I saw a lot of dead
during my walk,

26:30.389 --> 26:32.790
but two groups
concerned me the most.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.025
First, the gang of bandits,

26:35.027 --> 26:38.195
these figures
are completely black.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.832
Their eyes were white.

26:41.834 --> 26:47.670
They look like kind of
these mutant monsters.

26:47.672 --> 26:52.743
Next, I describe the prostitutes
terrorizing a young boy.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.210
He is pissed off.

26:54.212 --> 26:59.283
He's like this because
they keep him up all night.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.086
One of them is kind of
missing half of her face.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.187
It's been rotted off already.

27:04.189 --> 27:05.956
The other one,
her nose fell off.

27:12.665 --> 27:15.499
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:15.501 --> 27:18.902
Yes. That's what I saw.

27:37.956 --> 27:40.891
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:40.893 --> 27:42.893
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:42.895 --> 27:45.429
and our clients
for the first time.

27:45.431 --> 27:48.298
Amy, I'd like you to meet
Sara and her husband, Mark.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.968
Now, they live here
with their two young sons.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.303
I've got a photo.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.571
This is Lane, who is 13.

27:54.573 --> 27:57.340
This is Tanner, who's 10.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.776
Now, Mark here travels
a lot for work,

27:59.778 --> 28:01.378
so Sara and the boys
are left here a lot

28:01.380 --> 28:03.580
to face the violent
activity alone.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.149
She told me,
with everything going on,

28:05.151 --> 28:07.317
this place is just
a house, not a home.

28:07.319 --> 28:10.954
But they're both hoping
we can change that.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.523
So now that Amy
has met you guys,

28:12.525 --> 28:17.327
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk for us.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.862
When I got here,

28:18.864 --> 28:23.800
I saw something
that is really not good

28:23.802 --> 28:27.671
for living people --
a vortex.

28:27.673 --> 28:30.074
It's something that's
always been here,

28:30.076 --> 28:34.077
and this one is so large
and is very powerful.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.879
People who live in areas
like this

28:35.881 --> 28:38.215
will have a lot
of paranormal phenomena

28:38.217 --> 28:43.554
because entities and dead people
come and go through vortexes.

28:43.556 --> 28:48.492
The dead here, due to this
kind of energy, are stronger.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.894
They're gonna be
much more physical.

28:50.896 --> 28:55.065
They're gonna be able to do
a lot more to the living.

28:55.067 --> 28:59.035
And for the living, it makes
you guys a lot weaker.

28:59.037 --> 29:01.371
If you have a lot of
dead people around you,

29:01.373 --> 29:03.907
you're gonna have
a lot of dead energy

29:03.909 --> 29:06.510
which isn't
particularly healthy.

29:06.512 --> 29:11.181
And also, because the movement
of energy is so intense,

29:11.183 --> 29:14.051
the living here would be,
like, constantly falling,

29:14.053 --> 29:17.454
having vertigo-type
experiences.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.057
Now, we never talked about
equilibrium problems.

29:20.059 --> 29:24.261
You or anybody in the family
have any problems with that?
Yes.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.463
Months ago, it was just, like,

29:26.465 --> 29:28.732
someone had spun me
around 50 times.

29:28.734 --> 29:32.536
I could not get out
of the bathroom.

29:32.538 --> 29:35.873
This vortex can also cause you
to have nightmares

29:35.875 --> 29:38.742
and bad anxiety.

29:38.744 --> 29:43.013
I feel high, high anxiety
for no reason.

29:43.015 --> 29:46.416
Mark, do you or the boys
feel that way at all?

29:46.418 --> 29:49.453
- The boys definitely do --
- Okay.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.421
...especially Lane.

29:51.423 --> 29:54.124
Plus,
you mentioned nightmares.
Yeah.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.759
You feel like when you wake up,

29:55.761 --> 29:58.161
you have to look
around to be like,

29:58.163 --> 30:00.029
"Where the heck have I been?"

30:00.031 --> 30:01.898
And I spoke to both boys,

30:01.900 --> 30:04.901
and they're having
nightmare issues as well.-

30:04.903 --> 30:07.571
Long-term, what is this
gonna do to us?

30:07.573 --> 30:11.107
Being exposed to just
the vortex alone

30:11.109 --> 30:14.110
on a consistent
basis can develop

30:14.112 --> 30:17.581
into long-term
and terminal illnesses,

30:17.583 --> 30:19.182
things like brain cancer,

30:19.184 --> 30:23.820
dementia, Alzheimer's,
heart issues.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.855
Do you guys suffer
from anything like that?

30:25.857 --> 30:27.891
High blood pressure, yeah.

30:27.893 --> 30:31.561
But it seems like it probably
got worse when I came here.

30:31.563 --> 30:32.862
Exactly. That's the vortex?

30:32.864 --> 30:34.331
It could be, yeah.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.003
What else did you get?

30:40.005 --> 30:43.540
There are three groups
of dead people here.

30:43.542 --> 30:47.844
They are each from
a separate time period.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.414
One of the groups
is Native American.

30:50.416 --> 30:53.783
And basically, they've taken
over this basement area.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.386
There is a lot of
physical phenomena.

30:56.388 --> 31:01.325
Native Americans are constantly,
like, moving things.

31:01.327 --> 31:05.361
They don't want anything
down here or person,

31:05.363 --> 31:07.431
and it really
bothers them, you know?

31:07.433 --> 31:09.233
They want it all out.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.768
So I thought the living would
hear maybe the women talking,

31:11.770 --> 31:15.906
the children laughing
and playing, objects moving.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.374
When I spoke with Sara
down here in the basement,

31:17.376 --> 31:21.011
she told me about hearing voices
down here, conversations, right?

31:21.013 --> 31:22.445
Just whispers.
Imagine just people, you know...

31:24.650 --> 31:27.184
Yeah, I'll hear that.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.585
Now, you've also heard
someone screwing

31:28.587 --> 31:29.987
with the basement doorknob.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.588
Tell Amy what
happened that time.

31:31.590 --> 31:35.025
Imagine somebody walking up
the stairs and can't get up,

31:35.027 --> 31:38.594
got angry and just did
one of those.

31:38.596 --> 31:40.196
Now, Mark, did Lane tell you
about the story

31:40.198 --> 31:42.799
with the rocking
chair down here?

31:42.801 --> 31:44.934
Yeah. Just out of
the corner of his eye,

31:44.936 --> 31:48.338
he would see this
rocking chair move.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.073
Now, does that make sense
with all

31:50.075 --> 31:51.608
the Native Americans down here?

31:51.610 --> 31:54.944
Yes.

31:54.946 --> 31:58.348
There is one dead male
I saw very clearly.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.351
He is the leader of
the second group

32:01.353 --> 32:03.353
of dead people that are here,

32:03.355 --> 32:06.757
and I'll get to those
guys in a minute.

32:06.759 --> 32:10.894
This guy was extremely tall,
very thin, very pale.

32:10.896 --> 32:14.630
He looked to be in his 40s.

32:14.632 --> 32:16.767
He was wearing
an interesting hat.

32:16.769 --> 32:20.170
He also had a royal blue

32:20.172 --> 32:23.140
Military-style jacket.

32:23.142 --> 32:27.644
I think he was in the military,
and he went rogue.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.447
And like I said,
he had a team of men.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.717
I mean, I kept calling them kind
of, like, pirates or bandits

32:33.719 --> 32:36.586
because of how
they dressed and acted.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.455
Eventually, though,
all of these men

32:38.457 --> 32:41.791
became extremely ill
from some kind of illness,

32:41.793 --> 32:45.695
and they all died
horrible deaths.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.264
Some of the stuff you're talking
about reminds me

32:47.266 --> 32:49.332
of one of the original
owners of your property,

32:49.334 --> 32:52.269
and this guy goes back to 1858.

32:52.271 --> 32:57.007
He bought 670 acres, including
the property the house sits on.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.541
Now his name was Daniel Pauley.

32:58.543 --> 33:00.677
Now, you said the guy you saw
was in the Military

33:00.679 --> 33:04.013
and might have had
a Military jacket on?-

33:04.015 --> 33:06.550
Pauley served in the Union Army
during the Civil War

33:06.552 --> 33:10.220
which would have been
a blue uniform.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.321
He was 50 years old
when he joined.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.958
You said you saw a bunch of men
dying of some horrible illness.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.961
Now, when Pauley was serving,

33:17.963 --> 33:21.464
200 of the guys he served
with died of dysentery.

33:21.466 --> 33:23.633
But he managed
to survive somehow.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.836
Now, is it possible Pauley
could be the guy you saw?

33:25.838 --> 33:27.503
I kind of think it's unlikely.

33:27.505 --> 33:31.141
I didn't really feel
like they lived here.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.343
Okay.
At least we know who it's not.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.812
Now, does this guy in blue
and his men do anything

33:35.814 --> 33:38.714
to the living here?
- Yes.

33:38.716 --> 33:40.316
I think you might hear them

33:40.318 --> 33:44.054
and I tried to speak to them.

33:44.056 --> 33:47.724
But because they can't
physically manifest words,

33:47.726 --> 33:50.193
this weird noise came out.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.395
It's like this crackling
weird noise.

33:52.397 --> 33:53.529
Well, it's funny
you mention that

33:53.531 --> 33:54.598
because I just looked at Mark.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.800
He told me about hearing
these, like, a beep?

33:57.802 --> 34:01.004
Yeah, just a beep
out of nowhere.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.505
It sounds like it's right
next to you,

34:02.507 --> 34:05.142
but there is nothing there.

34:05.144 --> 34:09.012
I got that there is one male
that they don't particularly

34:09.014 --> 34:13.683
like here, that they do focus
on and pick on often.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.753
One of them attacked
this male here.

34:16.755 --> 34:21.024
I saw him jumping on his back,
pushing him up the stairs

34:21.025 --> 34:24.261
there into
the family room area,

34:24.263 --> 34:29.733
maybe feeling, like, an,
you know, a hit here maybe,

34:29.735 --> 34:33.235
maybe choking sensation,
maybe feeling like, you know,

34:33.237 --> 34:36.606
the wind's getting
knocked out of you.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.708
It sounds to me like
you're talking about Mark.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.076
Tell her about the experience
you had on the couch

34:40.078 --> 34:41.511
'cause that was pretty bad.

34:41.513 --> 34:45.281
One night, okay, my mouth was
wide open and I was snoring.

34:45.283 --> 34:47.317
And it just felt like
somebody had come up

34:47.319 --> 34:50.286
and took their hand
and slammed my mouth shut.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.956
And the bottom side of my chin

34:53.958 --> 34:57.126
tingled for at least
an hour or two.

34:57.128 --> 34:59.962
You mentioned you'd saw
a male getting attacked.

34:59.964 --> 35:01.198
- Yeah.
- But I got news for you.

35:01.200 --> 35:06.536
I got photos of Sara
waking up with bruises.

35:06.538 --> 35:09.206
Here, look at these.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.340
Wow.

35:11.342 --> 35:16.646
It feels like somebody has taken
a baseball bat to my ribcage.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.481
Is there any other way
Mark and Sara

35:18.483 --> 35:20.083
would experience these guys?

35:20.085 --> 35:23.520
It's possible that the living
could see them.

35:23.522 --> 35:28.258
They were in shadow and I had
a sketch done of what I saw.

35:33.532 --> 35:38.835
Wow.

35:38.837 --> 35:43.573
Wow.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.976
I have seen a dark apparition,

35:46.978 --> 35:50.247
a shadow figure,
that I thought was Mark,

35:50.249 --> 35:53.183
and he backed into the wall.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.652
So it sounds like these bandits
are what they're seeing?

35:55.654 --> 35:58.221
Correct.
These guys are always around.

35:58.223 --> 36:02.725
They don't ever leave.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.661
You said there were three
groups of dead people

36:04.663 --> 36:05.895
you were concerned about.
- Yeah.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.731
What was the third one?

36:07.733 --> 36:10.066
So there is this other group
of dead people

36:10.068 --> 36:13.469
that are here
that are prostitutes.

36:13.471 --> 36:15.705
There's two or three of them.

36:15.707 --> 36:20.276
I think that these women
suffered from syphilis.

36:21.647 --> 36:24.113
For instance,
one doesn't have a nose.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.516
There is another one
who has the sores.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.352
It can be a rotting disease.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.354
As far as what the living
would experience,

36:31.356 --> 36:33.155
they will go into your minds

36:33.157 --> 36:37.661
and pull out
really bad memories,

36:37.663 --> 36:41.097
causing wicked headaches
and nightmares.

36:41.099 --> 36:43.199
You and Tanner
both have headaches.

36:43.201 --> 36:47.070
I mean, we're talking
full-blown migraine to where,

36:47.072 --> 36:49.639
you know, you're nauseous.

36:49.641 --> 36:54.477
The other thing that's going
on is, they love children.

36:54.479 --> 36:57.747
They wanted the child
who's in the yellow room.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.449
That's Tanner.

36:59.451 --> 37:04.220
They're attracted to him
because he is a physical medium.

37:06.891 --> 37:11.127
A lot of this activity started
after Tanner hit about 2.

37:11.129 --> 37:12.996
Is there a connection
between him turning 2

37:12.998 --> 37:15.799
and what's going on here?
- Yes.

37:15.801 --> 37:20.002
He's becoming a little bit
more cognizant, you know, aware.

37:20.004 --> 37:22.538
So he can interact
with them in a way

37:22.540 --> 37:25.675
that a lot of other
people can't.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.443
You didn't have a surprised
look on your face

37:27.445 --> 37:28.678
when she said he was
a physical medium.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.747
You were like, "Yeah."

37:30.749 --> 37:33.149
- We kind of suspected it.
- You did?

37:33.151 --> 37:36.352
Yeah. I'm really worried
about him because ---

37:36.354 --> 37:37.621
...what's his life
going to be like

37:37.623 --> 37:39.022
and what do we tell him now?

37:39.024 --> 37:40.957
He strikes me as a kid,
when you talk to him,

37:40.959 --> 37:43.994
as somebody that has
been through a lot.

37:43.996 --> 37:46.162
A lot, exactly.

37:46.164 --> 37:49.499
I did have a sketch done of him

37:49.501 --> 37:53.336
being agitated by these women.

37:58.510 --> 38:01.978
That's gonna be tough
for you to see.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.579
Wow.

38:07.251 --> 38:10.953
I mean, I've seen him sit
in his bed like that.

38:10.955 --> 38:14.356
You can tell that
something bothers him.

38:14.358 --> 38:15.591
All right.

38:15.593 --> 38:17.727
So what do these prostitutes
want with Tanner anyway?

38:17.729 --> 38:19.462
These women are nuts.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.065
What they're trying
to figure out right now

38:22.067 --> 38:26.068
is if they want to take him

38:26.070 --> 38:29.606
or if they want to
attach to him.

38:29.608 --> 38:32.475
And if they were
to attach to him,

38:32.477 --> 38:36.345
they would then cause
issues throughout his life.

38:36.347 --> 38:40.950
If they decided to take him,
that would result in death.

38:58.069 --> 39:01.604
So Sara and Mark, you guys got
a lot of information tonight,

39:01.606 --> 39:05.041
probably a lot more
than you bargained for.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.576
But we still haven't
answered the big question.

39:06.578 --> 39:09.546
Is there anything you can do
to stop the activity here

39:09.548 --> 39:10.914
so that you guys can protect

39:10.916 --> 39:15.585
Tanner and live in peace
as a family again?

39:15.587 --> 39:20.390
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.458
Okay. So here we go.

39:22.460 --> 39:25.628
Basically, what can be done
about the vortex

39:25.630 --> 39:29.131
is a reversal
of the vortex energy.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.701
Take it from negative
to positive.

39:31.703 --> 39:35.805
That way, the entities aren't
anymore coming out at you.

39:35.807 --> 39:38.775
They're going in,
and then they're moving on.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.744
And negative energy
would dissipate over time.

39:41.746 --> 39:43.913
So how can they make
that happen?

39:43.915 --> 39:45.948
The one that I know,
she is a psychic knower

39:45.950 --> 39:47.517
and a Reiki master.

39:47.519 --> 39:48.851
Okay.

39:48.853 --> 39:52.288
And she also specializes
in working with vortex.

39:52.290 --> 39:55.090
It's an extremely
difficult task.

39:55.092 --> 39:57.927
I would give the odds 50/50.

39:57.929 --> 40:02.464
You'll know within a week, after
the practitioner were to leave,

40:02.466 --> 40:04.601
if it worked or not.

40:04.603 --> 40:08.170
Obviously, if it doesn't take,
I would recommend that you move.

40:11.076 --> 40:16.679
If it did work, then you would
need to find a physical medium

40:16.681 --> 40:20.883
and a shaman to move on the rest
of the dead that are here,

40:20.885 --> 40:23.953
the ones who think
that they're trapped.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.089
What about the whores?

40:26.091 --> 40:29.325
They're gonna be
harder to grasp,

40:29.327 --> 40:32.361
but the medium
will be able to do it.

40:32.363 --> 40:37.166
Yeah. They're not gonna have
another chance to kill my kid.

40:37.168 --> 40:42.405
They are not harming him
ever, ever, ever again.

40:42.407 --> 40:45.841
Even if all of this works,
you have to start dealing

40:45.843 --> 40:48.444
and learning about
the abilities that your son,

40:48.446 --> 40:51.247
Tanner, has, especially
focusing right now

40:51.249 --> 40:55.251
on protection measures
and meditation techniques.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.253
If you were in their shoes,
what would you do?

40:57.255 --> 41:00.356
- I would be out of here.
- Shoot.

41:00.358 --> 41:03.392
If they move and Tanner learns
how to deal with his abilities,

41:03.394 --> 41:07.463
should they be okay?
- Yeah.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.399
You know, normally,
I stick it to the clients.

41:09.401 --> 41:11.935
I'm like, "You're gonna do
what Amy advises you."

41:11.937 --> 41:14.203
This is one of those cases
where it's, like, you guys

41:14.205 --> 41:16.005
really got to figure this out

41:16.007 --> 41:17.673
and, you know,
this is your family.

41:17.675 --> 41:19.609
Not a tough decision
when it comes

41:19.611 --> 41:22.345
to the well-being of the family.

41:22.347 --> 41:25.615
- This is just a physical place.
- Yeah.

41:25.617 --> 41:26.749
I don't see how we can stay.

41:26.751 --> 41:30.553
We're definitely
gonna move.

41:30.555 --> 41:32.689
There is no guarantee
that a psychic knower

41:32.691 --> 41:35.625
and a Reiki master
can reverse the vortex on Mark

41:35.627 --> 41:37.160
and Sara's property,

41:37.162 --> 41:41.263
so I really hope they take
my advice and move.

41:41.265 --> 41:44.901
If they do that and teach Tanner
how to deal with his abilities,

41:44.903 --> 41:47.903
they should be able to
lead a peaceful life.
