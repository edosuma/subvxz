WEBVTT

00:02.029 --> 00:03.220
[theme music]

00:06.070 --> 00:09.130
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:09.150 --> 00:13.070
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:13.089 --> 00:17.100
They called themselves Smurfs.
They were good.

00:23.089 --> 00:29.019
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard. He was bad.

00:29.039 --> 00:32.070
Oh, I hate smurfs.

00:32.090 --> 00:34.009
I'll get you.

00:34.030 --> 00:37.170
I'll get all of you, if
it's the last thing I ever do!

00:37.189 --> 00:39.130
[Gargamel laughing]

00:39.149 --> 00:40.219
[Gargamel grunts]

00:41.000 --> 00:42.149
Oh, I'll get you.

00:42.170 --> 00:45.219
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:46.000 --> 00:48.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:48.049 --> 00:52.039
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:52.060 --> 00:55.039
And if you are good,
you may just catch

00:55.060 --> 00:57.200
a glimpse of the Smurfs.

01:00.170 --> 01:02.090
[instrumental music]

01:14.000 --> 01:17.219
Oh, how pretty.
Chrysanthesmurfs.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.109
They're my most favoritist.

01:21.129 --> 01:23.150
Oh. A yellow one.

01:23.170 --> 01:26.099
(Clumsy)
Smurfette,
look how much firewood..

01:26.120 --> 01:28.140
- Oops!
- Unh!

01:28.159 --> 01:31.159
(Smurfette)
'Clumsy, help.'

01:31.180 --> 01:35.219
Uh, Smurfette,
what's wrong? Where are you?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.140
(Smurfette)
'Down here.'

01:37.159 --> 01:40.189
(Clumsy)
Uh, down where?

01:40.210 --> 01:42.079
crash

01:42.099 --> 01:44.060
Oh, down here.

01:44.079 --> 01:47.120
Yes, and now
we're both down here.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.210
Uh, yeah, kind of cozy, huh?

01:49.229 --> 01:51.009
[laughs]

01:51.030 --> 01:55.009
Oh, Clumsy. How will we ever
get out of here?

01:55.030 --> 01:56.200
(Clumsy)
Uh, don't worry, Smurfette.

01:56.219 --> 01:58.099
I'll just climb up and..

01:59.129 --> 02:01.159
[screaming]

02:01.180 --> 02:04.129
Uh, there's still one thing
we haven't tried.

02:04.150 --> 02:06.040
What's that?

02:06.060 --> 02:07.129
Help!

02:07.150 --> 02:10.169
'Help, save us. Help!'

02:10.189 --> 02:15.090
(Smurfette)
Help. Someone, please help us.

02:15.110 --> 02:18.000
Oh, it's no use.
Nobody can hear us.

02:18.020 --> 02:19.210
Oh, what'll we do?

02:19.229 --> 02:22.020
[growling]

02:22.039 --> 02:23.159
[gasps]
What's that?

02:23.180 --> 02:25.060
Maybe it's Papa Smurf.

02:25.079 --> 02:29.030
[speaking softly]
Clumsy, Papa Smurf
doesn't growl.

02:29.050 --> 02:32.000
[growling]

02:32.020 --> 02:33.120
[gasps]

02:33.139 --> 02:35.180
[growling]

02:35.199 --> 02:39.050
[Clumsy whimpering]
'Wh-what is it?'

02:41.030 --> 02:43.110
[growling]

02:43.129 --> 02:47.069
Bluster, you ungrateful cur.

02:47.090 --> 02:49.009
Had you cornered
a tasty rabbit

02:49.030 --> 02:51.139
that you were not about to
share with your master?

02:54.120 --> 02:59.039
If it weren't for me, you'd be
nothing but a feast for fleas.

02:59.060 --> 03:02.159
And speaking of feasts,
roast rabbit would be.

03:02.180 --> 03:04.090
Aha!

03:04.110 --> 03:07.020
By thunder, what are you?

03:07.039 --> 03:10.009
Uh, she's C-Clumsy
and I'm Smurfette.

03:10.030 --> 03:11.159
Uh, I mean, uh, I'm--

03:11.180 --> 03:13.030
We're Smurfs.

03:13.050 --> 03:15.169
Smurfs. Incredible.

03:15.189 --> 03:19.050
The world will pay a fortune
to see such tiny creatures.

03:19.069 --> 03:21.180
Once you become
the star attractions

03:21.199 --> 03:26.099
of Bombast's Traveling Show.

03:26.120 --> 03:30.090
You, my little pets will be
the most unique theatrical act

03:30.110 --> 03:33.079
ever beheld by human eyes.

03:33.099 --> 03:35.229
But-but we don't do any tricks.

03:36.009 --> 03:37.199
I can do a cartwheel.

03:37.219 --> 03:40.069
Clumsy, no, you can't.

03:40.090 --> 03:42.069
Sure, I can. Watch.

03:43.009 --> 03:44.039
[groans]

03:46.060 --> 03:48.020
- Unh!
- Oops!

03:48.039 --> 03:50.069
Uh, sorry, Smurfette.

03:50.090 --> 03:51.229
See what I mean?

03:52.009 --> 03:53.069
No matter.

03:53.090 --> 03:58.110
I, Bombast the Great,
trained this empty-headed hound.

03:58.129 --> 04:01.219
And I can do wonders
with you too.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.129
[growling]

04:03.150 --> 04:07.129
'Quiet. Soon these little pets
will make your feeble dog act'

04:07.150 --> 04:10.020
'a thing of the past.'

04:15.189 --> 04:17.220
(Smurfette)
Oh! Where are we going?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.009
Papa Smurf
will never find us now.

04:21.029 --> 04:25.180
Uh, yeah. Sure are a long way
from the village.

04:28.029 --> 04:31.120
Uh, why are you smurfing
all those flowers, Smurfette?

04:31.139 --> 04:32.189
Shh.

04:34.139 --> 04:37.000
So Papa Smurf can find us.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.100
Huh?

04:46.079 --> 04:50.199
- Clumsy.
- Where are you?

04:50.220 --> 04:53.009
Smurfette.

04:53.029 --> 04:56.019
Look carefully, Smurfs.
We have to find them.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.089
- Hold it, what have we here?
- Flower.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.149
[gasps]
Smurfette likes flowers.

05:02.170 --> 05:04.220
And Clumsy was gathering
firewood.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.209
But where are they now?

05:06.230 --> 05:09.009
"Ode to the Missing Smurfs."

05:09.029 --> 05:12.009
Where, oh, where
Can the little Smurfs be..

05:14.069 --> 05:16.029
I hate sad poems.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.180
(Hefty)
'Papa Smurf.'

05:17.199 --> 05:20.009
Giant footprints.

05:20.029 --> 05:23.009
Hm.
These were made by a human.

05:23.029 --> 05:24.160
Papa Smurf, look.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.160
Wagon tracks.

05:26.180 --> 05:30.089
Hm. The puzzle is beginning
to smurf together.

05:30.110 --> 05:32.220
But what does it mean,
Papa Smurf?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.149
It means Smurfette and Clumsy
have been smurfnapped.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.180
(all)
'Smurfnapped?'

05:39.199 --> 05:43.029
We must follow the trail
wherever it leads. Quickly.

05:46.090 --> 05:49.009
Faster, you lazy beast, faster.

05:50.199 --> 05:53.139
And you, cease
that infernal snuffling.

05:57.159 --> 06:00.189
You're soiling my garments,
canine.

06:00.209 --> 06:03.199
Desist, or I shall..
What's this?

06:05.079 --> 06:09.060
'Aha! So that's it, eh?'

06:11.100 --> 06:14.100
(Clumsy)
Uh, what are we stopping for?

06:14.120 --> 06:16.069
(Bombast)
Sorry, my pet.

06:16.089 --> 06:18.160
But your rescuers,
whoever they may be

06:18.180 --> 06:21.139
have just come to the end
of the trail.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.110
[laughing]

06:46.090 --> 06:50.069
Boy, there's so many wagon
tracks, which one do we follow?

06:50.090 --> 06:52.189
How will we find them now,
Papa Smurf?

06:52.209 --> 06:56.000
(Papa Smurf)
'This road leads to a
human village not far ahead.'

06:56.019 --> 07:00.029
The wagon must be going there.
And so are we.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.060
(all)
A human village.

07:02.079 --> 07:05.120
It's a place of many dangers,
my little Smurfs.

07:05.139 --> 07:07.089
But we have no choice.

07:07.110 --> 07:09.170
(all)
Yes, Papa Smurf.

07:19.060 --> 07:22.029
No, no, no. Do it again.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.079
And this time, do it right.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.029
Yes, sir.

07:30.089 --> 07:31.209
Whoa! Unh!

07:33.009 --> 07:34.199
[growling]

07:34.220 --> 07:38.189
Bluster, stop.
How dare you endanger my stars.

07:38.209 --> 07:40.050
Now back off.

07:40.069 --> 07:42.129
[gulps]

07:42.149 --> 07:46.079
Please, Mr. Bombast,
these tricks are too hard.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.090
You will do as I command.

07:55.079 --> 07:58.019
(Bombast)
'The great Bombast
never gives up.'

08:01.180 --> 08:03.129
Not so fast, Clumsy.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.129
It's not me, it's the ball.

08:05.149 --> 08:07.180
Whoa! Unh!

08:08.069 --> 08:09.149
Fools.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.040
We'll just have to keep trying

08:11.060 --> 08:14.100
until we find
something you can do.

08:16.149 --> 08:19.000
How much farther, Papa Smurf?

08:19.019 --> 08:20.139
Not far now.

08:25.180 --> 08:27.189
How much farther, Pa--

08:27.209 --> 08:29.160
Now don't start that again.

08:29.180 --> 08:31.170
[organ music]

08:33.169 --> 08:38.220
That's it, keep it up.
One, two, one, two, one, two.

08:40.159 --> 08:43.120
I say, Bluster,
aren't they looking good?

08:43.139 --> 08:46.019
[grumbling]

08:46.039 --> 08:49.100
Alright, Smurfs,
that's enough.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.210
[both panting]

08:52.120 --> 08:55.120
(Bombast)
'I think you're finally ready
for your debut.'

09:07.110 --> 09:11.059
Faster, mule. Every moment
wasted is money lost.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.100
[grumbling]

09:13.120 --> 09:18.009
Ooh, Clumsy,
look how big everything is.

09:18.029 --> 09:22.070
Yeah. I wonder how Papa Smurf
will ever find us here.

09:22.090 --> 09:27.070
Aye, fresh fish.
Get your fresh fish here. Aye!

09:30.100 --> 09:32.049
(Papa Smurf)
'Wait here, my little Smurfs.'

09:32.070 --> 09:34.080
'I'm going
to have a look around.'

09:37.169 --> 09:39.220
Be careful, Papa Smurf.

09:45.009 --> 09:46.159
Oh, my smurfs.

09:48.179 --> 09:49.230
[panting]

09:50.009 --> 09:52.039
Did you see anything,
Papa Smurf?

09:52.059 --> 09:56.100
Yes, I got a very close look
at a wagon wheel.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.129
Papa Smurf,
there are so many wagons

09:58.149 --> 10:00.190
how will we know
which is the right one?

10:00.210 --> 10:04.019
We'll just have to look
at all of them, Greedy.

10:05.039 --> 10:07.139
I hate wagons.

10:07.159 --> 10:09.210
[instrumental music]

10:12.110 --> 10:14.129
(Papa Smurf)
'Remember,
smurf your eyes open.'

10:14.149 --> 10:17.049
We don't want
anything sneaking up behind..

10:17.070 --> 10:18.149
Aah!

10:18.169 --> 10:20.210
(all)
Help! Help!

10:22.000 --> 10:23.169
[all coughing]

10:25.159 --> 10:27.129
Is everything alright?

10:27.149 --> 10:29.120
[panting]

10:29.139 --> 10:31.100
Yes, Hefty. That was close.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.039
(Greedy)
'How close was it?'

10:33.059 --> 10:37.000
It was so close,
my whole life flashed before me.

10:37.019 --> 10:39.029
And what a funny life it was.

10:39.049 --> 10:40.139
[laughs]

10:40.159 --> 10:42.210
Hold it. Where's Grouchy?

10:42.230 --> 10:44.070
[all gasp]

10:44.090 --> 10:47.019
Grouchy. Oh, no.

10:47.039 --> 10:49.190
I hate crowds.

10:52.169 --> 10:54.039
[humming]

10:55.210 --> 10:58.139
Observe, my pint-sized
performers

10:58.159 --> 11:01.110
you're about to make me
rich and famous.

11:01.129 --> 11:02.139
[growls]

11:05.190 --> 11:10.090
And you, miserable cur
will guard my precious pets

11:10.110 --> 11:13.049
while I hang
these posters around town.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.220
Is that clear?

11:16.090 --> 11:22.090
And woe to you if any harm
befalls them. Understood?

11:26.129 --> 11:27.230
[growling]

11:29.149 --> 11:32.019
This is like looking for a
needle in a haystack

11:32.039 --> 11:33.100
Papa Smurf.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.220
Don't give up. Clumsy
and Smurfette must be nearby

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
and we won't leave
without them.

11:39.019 --> 11:40.179
[humming]

11:42.190 --> 11:44.039
Someone's coming.

12:04.059 --> 12:05.120
[sighs]

12:10.120 --> 12:11.159
[gasps]

12:11.179 --> 12:14.110
Oh, go back to your poster,
Bluster.

12:14.129 --> 12:16.210
We were just practicing
our dancing.

12:18.190 --> 12:20.120
[sobbing]

12:20.139 --> 12:25.000
Ah, it's no use, Clumsy.
We'll never smurf out of here.

12:25.019 --> 12:29.159
Uh, yeah. And I'll bet Bluster
sure will be glad to see us go.

12:29.179 --> 12:32.200
Clumsy, you just gave me
an idea.

12:32.220 --> 12:35.009
Uh, I did?

12:35.029 --> 12:38.080
You know, Clumsy,
if we could escape

12:38.100 --> 12:42.179
then Bluster would be
the star of the show again.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.129
[growling]

12:47.139 --> 12:49.220
But how could
two little old Smurfs

12:50.000 --> 12:53.100
ever escape
from this big old cage?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.019
Uh, yeah, how?

12:55.039 --> 12:56.230
[grunting]

12:57.009 --> 13:04.059
[sighs]
I guess we're stuck, and poor
Bluster will never be a star.

13:11.169 --> 13:14.210
Oh, Bluster. What a surprise.

13:14.230 --> 13:18.100
And we'll never tell.
Will we, Clumsy?

13:18.120 --> 13:20.169
Uh, tell what, Smurfette?

13:20.190 --> 13:23.000
[growling]

13:23.019 --> 13:26.029
[sighs]
Never mind, Clumsy. Come on.

13:28.230 --> 13:30.120
[laughing]

13:32.230 --> 13:35.110
Uh, where are we going,
Smurfette?

13:35.129 --> 13:38.159
As far from Bombast as we can.

13:40.009 --> 13:42.029
Oof! Uh, what are you stopping--

13:42.049 --> 13:44.100
- Shh!
- Uh-oh.

13:48.169 --> 13:51.129
[both yelling]

13:51.149 --> 13:54.120
Ooh, ugh! That smurfs.

13:54.139 --> 13:59.049
Oh, dear. This is
mean old Bombast's nail sack.

13:59.070 --> 14:02.110
We've gotta get out of here.
Oh, dear.

14:02.129 --> 14:06.230
Now to prepare for the crowds
and their money.

14:07.009 --> 14:08.090
[laughs]

14:09.200 --> 14:11.210
We've looked and looked.

14:11.230 --> 14:13.210
And looked and looked.

14:13.230 --> 14:17.179
I hate looking and looking
and looking and looking.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.149
Papa Smurf, are you sure

14:19.169 --> 14:23.019
we're gonna find
Smurfette and Clumsy again?

14:23.039 --> 14:26.049
Of course I'm sure.

14:26.070 --> 14:27.220
I think.

14:31.159 --> 14:34.059
Escaped?

14:34.080 --> 14:39.029
You blundering cur. I ordered
you to watch them, didn't I?

14:39.049 --> 14:41.080
[grunting]

14:41.100 --> 14:44.190
You dare disobey
the great Bombast.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.210
For that, you will pay dearly.

14:46.230 --> 14:50.210
'When I'm through,
even fleas won't bite you.'

14:50.230 --> 14:52.139
'I'm going to..'

14:52.159 --> 14:54.149
[barks]

14:54.169 --> 14:56.190
Quiet. When I'm speaking to..

14:56.210 --> 14:59.029
Aha! What's this?

14:59.049 --> 15:01.000
Run, Clumsy, run.

15:01.019 --> 15:04.149
Don't just sit there,
loutish lump. After them.

15:04.169 --> 15:05.210
[barks]

15:10.159 --> 15:12.230
[whispering]
He's coming. Go that way.

15:13.009 --> 15:14.210
I'm getting dizzy.

15:16.070 --> 15:17.169
Whoops!

15:17.190 --> 15:19.080
[barking]

15:21.100 --> 15:23.120
(Bombast)
Mind the mule, foolish dog.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.090
When disturbed,
he has a tendency to..

15:25.110 --> 15:27.039
[mule brays]

15:27.059 --> 15:28.120
Oof!

15:28.139 --> 15:29.190
...kick.

15:29.210 --> 15:33.120
Come on, Clumsy.
Now's our chance to escape.

15:33.139 --> 15:34.200
Clumsy?

15:34.220 --> 15:36.220
Ha-ha-ha! Did you see that?

15:37.000 --> 15:40.159
Ha, ha! And they call me Clumsy.
Ha-ha-ha!

15:40.179 --> 15:43.110
Never mind that.
We've gotta get..

15:43.129 --> 15:47.169
Well, well. It appears that
the show will go on.

15:47.190 --> 15:49.070
[laughs]

15:50.000 --> 15:51.110
[sighs]

15:54.080 --> 15:56.000
[thunder rumbling]

16:00.169 --> 16:05.179
Ah, Azrael. Don't you just love
gray, gloomy days?

16:05.200 --> 16:07.230
It keeps all the peasants away.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.019
[mews]

16:12.070 --> 16:14.059
[thunder crashing]

16:14.080 --> 16:18.080
(Bombast)
How dare it rain
on this of all days.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.090
It's ruining all my plans.

16:20.110 --> 16:23.059
Now there will be
no audience and no money.

16:23.080 --> 16:27.029
Only fools would venture out
in this weather.

16:27.049 --> 16:31.039
Well, well.
And there's a fool now.

16:31.059 --> 16:32.110
[both gasp]

16:32.129 --> 16:34.200
(both)
'It's Gargamel.'

16:34.220 --> 16:39.070
Egad. Smurfs, Azrael.
Here, in the city.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.019
[mews]

16:41.039 --> 16:45.190
I knew this was going to be
a good day. Ha-ha-ha!

16:45.210 --> 16:47.230
Step right up, my good man.

16:48.009 --> 16:51.139
The show is about to begin.

16:51.159 --> 16:56.070
Stage fright, eh? Well, relax.
Your audience of one awaits.

16:56.090 --> 16:58.230
'And one penny
is better than no pennies.'

16:59.009 --> 17:01.019
And now, we present..

17:02.129 --> 17:04.220
Huh?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.140
Uh, gosh, Smurfette.
Where'd Gargamel go?

17:08.160 --> 17:10.180
Right here. Ha-ha-ha!

17:10.200 --> 17:14.200
At last you're in my clutches,
you miserable blue termites.

17:14.220 --> 17:17.089
[mews]

17:17.108 --> 17:19.059
Quiet, Azra..

17:21.079 --> 17:22.220
Uh-uh, nice doggy.

17:23.009 --> 17:26.220
I was just getting your little
actors' autographs. Ha, ha.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.099
See? There they are.
Ha, ha. All nice and safe.

17:31.119 --> 17:33.170
[growling]

17:33.190 --> 17:37.000
I wish I could stay
for the show but..

17:37.019 --> 17:38.210
[barks]

17:39.170 --> 17:41.200
[yowls]

17:41.220 --> 17:44.109
I really must be going. Yow!

17:44.130 --> 17:46.099
Unhand me, miserable cat.

17:46.119 --> 17:49.069
I can't see where I'm..
Oof!

17:49.089 --> 17:54.150
So trying to see
a free show, eh?

17:54.170 --> 17:59.119
Not true, sir. Not true.
Wizard's honor. Ha-ha-ha.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.200
What now, Papa?

18:00.220 --> 18:03.210
Yeah, we've smurfed
all kinds of wagons.

18:03.230 --> 18:06.069
We haven't smurfed that wagon.

18:07.049 --> 18:09.200
Uh, I'll volunteer.

18:09.220 --> 18:12.150
Smurfette, Clumsy,
where are you?

18:12.170 --> 18:16.000
Are you hiding in there,
little Smurfs?

18:16.019 --> 18:18.180
[grunts]
It's too heavy.

18:18.200 --> 18:22.019
Oh, I guess I'll just have to
eat my way through.

18:26.220 --> 18:28.069
Uh-oh.

18:30.039 --> 18:31.160
Phew! That was close.

18:33.150 --> 18:35.059
Any luck, Greedy?

18:35.079 --> 18:38.029
Uh, y-yes, Papa. All bad.

18:45.039 --> 18:49.130
- It's no use.
- They're gone forever.

18:49.150 --> 18:51.089
Poor Smurfette.

18:51.109 --> 18:53.119
Poor Clumsy.

18:53.140 --> 18:56.099
My little Smurfs,
we've come this far.

18:56.119 --> 18:58.049
And we can't stop now.

18:58.069 --> 19:00.009
(Bombast)
'How dare you view
my little blue pets'

19:00.029 --> 19:01.099
'without paying the price?'

19:01.119 --> 19:03.009
Little blue pets?

19:03.029 --> 19:05.140
(Gargamel)
'But-but I'll pay
ten times the price.'

19:05.160 --> 19:10.130
'I don't just want to view them,
I-I want to buy them.'

19:10.150 --> 19:12.230
- That sounds like--
- Gargamel.

19:13.009 --> 19:16.000
- I hate--
- Never mind. Come on.

19:16.019 --> 19:20.130
The Great Bombast
sell his stars? Never.

19:20.150 --> 19:22.069
But I'll double the amount.

19:22.089 --> 19:25.130
And throw in
this slightly-used cat for free.

19:25.150 --> 19:27.009
[yowling]

19:28.180 --> 19:32.069
No deal.
And don't bother me again.

19:32.089 --> 19:35.210
I have a show to put on.

19:35.230 --> 19:37.210
Perhaps he'll change his tune

19:37.230 --> 19:41.000
when his little performers
can't perform.

19:44.019 --> 19:47.140
I don't know who's worse,
Bombast or Gargamel.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.019
Oh. That's a tough one,
Smurfette.

19:54.220 --> 19:57.099
Uh, hey, the fog's rolling in.

19:57.119 --> 19:59.210
That's not fog. It's-it's..

20:04.009 --> 20:06.069
[both snoring]

20:07.059 --> 20:08.180
[laughing]

20:08.200 --> 20:14.079
Now, Azrael, Bombast will beg us
to buy his useless Smurfs.

20:14.099 --> 20:15.200
[laughs]

20:15.220 --> 20:17.220
[laughs]

20:18.000 --> 20:20.069
[gasps]
Smurfette, what's wrong?

20:20.089 --> 20:23.109
Gargamel must've cast
a sleeping spell on them.

20:23.130 --> 20:26.029
(Bombast)
'Showtime.'

20:26.049 --> 20:28.019
And now, ladies and gentlemen

20:28.039 --> 20:31.079
here they are
to amaze and astound you.

20:31.099 --> 20:35.039
The one and only Smurfs.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.230
[snoring]

20:39.119 --> 20:41.160
[crowd jeering]

20:42.200 --> 20:45.190
Wake up. Wake up.
Don't do this to me.

20:45.210 --> 20:49.210
Hm. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Looks like
your Smurfs have let you down.

20:49.230 --> 20:51.109
You, again?

20:51.130 --> 20:53.119
Yes. And although these
little creatures

20:53.140 --> 20:57.009
are obviously worthless,
I'll do you a favor and--

20:57.029 --> 21:02.059
You'll do me a favor, alright.
Let's step backstage, shall we?

21:02.079 --> 21:06.059
No. Wait. Wait, Bombast. Listen,
I'll make you another deal.

21:07.089 --> 21:09.099
Okay, the coast is clear.

21:10.220 --> 21:14.119
We must move fast, or
we'll all wind up in this cage.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.200
Poor Smurfette.

21:15.220 --> 21:17.099
(Greedy)
'Poor Clumsy.'

21:17.119 --> 21:20.200
(Hefty)
Pour it on.
We gotta get out of here.

21:20.220 --> 21:23.150
No, please.
You'll give me a headache.

21:23.170 --> 21:26.000
You already gave me a headache.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.109
Azrael, do something to help me.

21:28.130 --> 21:29.220
[growling]

21:32.140 --> 21:36.140
And now, ladies
and gentlemen.. Ha-ha-ha.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.200
The show must go on.

21:38.220 --> 21:44.029
Presenting the waltzing wizard.

21:45.210 --> 21:48.039
[organ music]

21:53.230 --> 21:55.160
[crowd jeering]

21:58.130 --> 22:01.150
B-but it gets better
as it goes, I promise.

22:06.079 --> 22:10.009
- Wha-what happened?
- Uh, yeah.

22:10.029 --> 22:14.079
Papa Smurf.
Oh, am I glad to see you.

22:14.099 --> 22:17.180
Oh, boy. Am I glad
to be out of show business.

22:17.200 --> 22:21.049
I'll bet they know
just how you feel. Look.

22:21.069 --> 22:23.220
[both grunting]

22:31.049 --> 22:32.170
[dog barking]

22:32.190 --> 22:36.000
- Oops! What is it, Papa Smurf?
- Shh! Listen.

22:36.019 --> 22:37.210
[dog barking]

22:39.079 --> 22:41.160
[wagon approaching]

22:41.180 --> 22:43.180
They're coming after us,
Papa Smurf.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.039
(Papa Smurf)
'Quickly.
Smurf behind that log.'

22:47.200 --> 22:49.160
But-but you don't understand.

22:49.180 --> 22:52.059
I-I will really pay you
this time.

22:52.079 --> 22:57.000
Never mind.
My payment will be your hide.

22:57.019 --> 22:58.150
[all cheering]

23:00.200 --> 23:04.200
Bravo!
That's what all good shows need.

23:04.220 --> 23:06.099
What's that, Papa Smurf?

23:06.119 --> 23:08.150
A happy ending.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.099
[theme music]
