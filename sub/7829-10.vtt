12:18.320 --> 12:20.156
Preparations for your
birthday have begun.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.949
I won't get what I really want.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.993
No one does.

12:24.076 --> 12:28.956
<i>♪ Happy birthday,</i>
<i>Mr. Smithers ♪</i>

12:29.039 --> 12:31.667
Hmm...

12:31.751 --> 12:33.502
People like dogs,
Mr. Burns.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.130
Nonsense! Dogs are idiots.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.465
Think about it, Smithers.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.883
If I came into your house

12:38.966 --> 12:40.468
and started sniffing
at your crotch

12:40.551 --> 12:41.969
and slobbering
all over your face,

12:42.052 --> 12:43.471
what would you say?

12:43.554 --> 12:45.306
Hmm. If <i>you</i> did it, sir?

12:45.389 --> 12:48.058
-I'll print you out a copy.
-Thanks.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.394
<i>Hello, Smithers.</i>

12:50.478 --> 12:53.856
<i>(halting cadence)</i>
<i>You're quite good at turning me on.</i>

12:53.939 --> 12:56.650
Um... you probably
should ignore that.

12:56.734 --> 13:00.446
I dreamed about her again
last night, Smithers.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.864
You know that dream
where you're in bed

13:01.947 --> 13:03.699
and they fly in
through the window?

13:09.330 --> 13:10.498
Ohh...

13:10.581 --> 13:13.042
MCCLURE:
<i>As you can see,</i>

13:13.125 --> 13:14.752
<i>the real deal with Wayland</i>
<i>Smithers is</i>

13:14.835 --> 13:16.295
<i>that he's Mr. Burns' assistant.</i>

13:16.378 --> 13:18.506
He's in his early 40s,
is unmarried

13:18.589 --> 13:20.841
and currently resides
in Springfield.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.176
Thanks for writing.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.886
We'll be right back.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.596
ANNOUNCER: <i>Which popular</i>
<i>Simpsons characters</i>

13:25.679 --> 13:27.932
<i>have died in the past year?</i>

13:35.064 --> 13:36.649
<i>If you said Bleeding</i>
<i>Gums Murphy</i>

13:36.732 --> 13:38.317
<i>and Dr. Marvin Monroe,</i>

13:38.400 --> 13:41.070
<i>you are wrong--</i>
<i>they were never popular.</i>

13:41.153 --> 13:42.988
Right about now,
you're probably saying

13:43.072 --> 13:45.574
"Troy, I've seen
every Simpsons episode.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.743
You can't show me anything new."

13:47.827 --> 13:50.371
You've got some attitude,
mister.

13:50.454 --> 13:54.333
Besides, you're wrong because
sometimes episodes run long

13:54.416 --> 13:55.835
and certain scenes
never get aired.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.170
So fire up your V.C.R.,

13:58.254 --> 14:00.005
because here,
for the first time ever

14:00.089 --> 14:02.216
are the cut-out classics.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.510
(projector whirring)

14:06.971 --> 14:09.181
<i>When Krusty the Clown</i>
<i>got canceled,</i>

14:09.265 --> 14:11.267
<i>he tried everything</i>
<i>to stay on the air.</i>

14:11.350 --> 14:13.936
<i>Here's what you didn't see.</i>

14:14.019 --> 14:15.437
If you watch my show,

14:15.521 --> 14:17.857
I will send you this book
featuring me

14:17.940 --> 14:20.150
in a variety
of sexually explicit positions.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.986
What? Oh! Hey!

14:22.069 --> 14:24.363
It's not really me!
I used a stunt butt!

14:24.446 --> 14:28.659
Krusty, we're from the network.
We have some bad news.

14:28.742 --> 14:29.827
I'm afraid your show's
been canceled.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.413
Oh, I thought this would happen.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.290
I just hope you replace me
with something

14:34.373 --> 14:37.501
as educational and uplifting
as I tried to be.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.086
Actually, it's a hemorrhoid
infomercial

14:39.169 --> 14:40.546
starring Claude Akins.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.840
Can I play Hemorrhoid
Sufferer Number One?

14:42.923 --> 14:44.675
Ooh! Oh, that hurts!

14:44.758 --> 14:46.510
Oh! Oh, is there
no relief?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.178
I don't think so.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.723
Well, how about one
of the "after" guys?

14:50.806 --> 14:53.267
Ah! Oh, that's better.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.185
I can ride a bike again!

14:55.269 --> 14:57.730
-Sorry.
-Ohh.

14:57.813 --> 15:00.232
<i>When Springfield </i>
<i>legalized gambling,</i>

15:00.316 --> 15:02.610
<i>Homer became a blackjack</i>
<i>dealer,</i>

15:02.693 --> 15:05.487
<i>and comedy was in the cards.</i>

15:05.571 --> 15:07.865
Twenty. Your move, Mr. Bond.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.701
I'll take a hit, dealer.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.412
Joker? You were supposed to
take those out of the deck.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.331
Sorry. Here's another one.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.166
What is this card?

15:17.249 --> 15:19.084
"Rules for draw and stud poker"?

15:19.168 --> 15:21.045
What a pity, Mr. Bond.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.880
What?! Well, it
was Homer's fault.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.548
I didn't lose.
I never lose.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.508
Well, at least tell me
the details

15:26.592 --> 15:28.260
of your plot for
world domination!

15:28.344 --> 15:30.721
Ha ha ha! I'm not going to
fall for that one again.

(chewing loudly)

15:40.689 --> 15:42.733
Homer, please.

15:42.816 --> 15:46.111
You don't have to wolf down
that 25-year-old candy

15:46.195 --> 15:47.571
just to make me happy.

15:47.655 --> 15:51.075
But it won't make you
unhappy, right?

15:51.158 --> 15:53.786
Hey! Space food sticks!

15:53.869 --> 15:57.373
Oh, I wish I had these
on my space adventure.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.626
Did you know I was blasted
into space two years ago, Mom?

16:00.709 --> 16:02.544
Oh, sure. I read all about it.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.255
I mean, it was national news.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.299
Do you still work for NASA?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.468
No, I work
at the nuclear power plant.

16:09.551 --> 16:10.803
Oh, Homer.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.721
Well, you'll be
happy to know

16:12.805 --> 16:14.390
I don't work very hard.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.141
Actually, I'm bringing
the plant down

16:16.225 --> 16:18.560

16:44.420 --> 16:48.924
"Cases won in 30 minutes
or your pizza's free."

16:49.008 --> 16:52.636
I'd sell my soul
for a Formula 1 racing car.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.055
(chuckling)
That can be arranged.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.891
Changed my mind. Sorry.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.268
Cool.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.978
Bart, stop
pestering Satan.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.897
Your Honor, we find
that Homer Simpson's soul

17:03.981 --> 17:06.525
is legally the property
of Marge Simpson

17:06.608 --> 17:08.485
-and not of the devil.
-Oh...

Well, I didn't win.
Here's your pizza.

17:15.743 --> 17:16.827
But we did win.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.412
That's okay. The box is empty.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.708
If that's what they cut out,

17:22.791 --> 17:25.169
what they leave in
must be pure gold!

17:25.252 --> 17:26.628
Let's watch some more

Simpsons outtakes.

enjoy this movie.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.618
This movie you rented sucks.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.079
No, it doesn't.
It's funny.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.830
Their clothes are different
from my clothes.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.415
(laughs)

18:03.499 --> 18:04.875
Look at what they're wearing.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.127

18:07.211 --> 18:10.672
<i>A few years back,</i>
<i>Bart was adopted by Mr. Burns.</i>

18:20.682 --> 18:22.392
I want to stay here
with Mr. Burns.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.394
I suggest you leave
immediately.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.939
Or what? You'll release
the dogs or the bees

18:27.022 --> 18:29.108
or the dogs with bees
in their mouth

18:29.191 --> 18:31.568
and when they bark,
they shoot bees at you?

18:31.652 --> 18:32.986
Well, go ahead!

18:33.070 --> 18:34.488
Do your worst!

18:34.571 --> 18:36.115
My worst, eh?

18:36.198 --> 18:39.409
Smithers, release
the robotic Richard Simmons.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.330
Come on, big boy!

18:43.413 --> 18:45.332
Shake the butter
off those buns!

19:12.234 --> 19:14.570

19:17.865 --> 19:19.950
This past summer,
all of America

19:20.033 --> 19:24.538
was trying to solve the mystery
of who shot Mr. Burns.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.748
Then they found out
it was the baby.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.208
(coughs)

19:28.292 --> 19:30.002
To keep this bombshell secret,

19:30.085 --> 19:32.421
the producers animated
several solutions

19:32.504 --> 19:34.715
that were never intended
to air.

19:36.133 --> 19:40.012
(groaning)

19:40.095 --> 19:45.017
(groaning)

19:45.100 --> 19:47.978
And to keep the show's
animators, editors, staff,

19:48.061 --> 19:50.647
and hangers-on
from leaking the solution,

19:50.731 --> 19:53.150
two completely different
endings were produced--

19:53.233 --> 19:55.319
one real, one phony.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.363
Here's the ending
you were never meant to see.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.324
The one who shot me was...

20:02.659 --> 20:04.161
(screaming)

20:04.244 --> 20:05.913
Wayland Smithers.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.998
No!

20:08.081 --> 20:08.999
Wait a minute.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.709
Yes.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.879
With the sun blocker
in place and the town aghast,

20:13.962 --> 20:15.380
I was on top of the world.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.592
So I wanted to kick up
my heels and indulge

20:18.675 --> 20:19.635
my sweet tooth.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.553
I feel like celebrating.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.515
Oh, it's you.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.850
What are you
so happy about?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.101
(Burns gasps)

20:28.185 --> 20:29.102
I see.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.729
Smithers had thwarted

20:30.812 --> 20:32.856
my earlier attempt
to take candy from a baby,

20:32.940 --> 20:35.108
but with him out
of the picture,

20:35.192 --> 20:37.569
I was free to wallow
in my own crapulence...

20:37.653 --> 20:39.446
or so I thought.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.698
At the last moment,

20:41.782 --> 20:44.326
Smithers, drunk as a lemur,
lurched out

20:44.409 --> 20:45.702
of the darkness and fired.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.912
(groaning)

20:46.995 --> 20:48.288
That's right.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.958
Right before I shot Jasper.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.543
Hmm. I was busy that night.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.671
BURNS:
<i>Stricken, I lurched forth</i>

20:55.754 --> 20:57.422
<i>in search of aid.</i>

20:57.506 --> 20:59.216
<i>But, finding only slack-jawed</i>
<i>gawkers,</i>

20:59.299 --> 21:01.468
<i>I gave up and collapsed</i>
<i>on the sundial.</i>

21:01.551 --> 21:04.221
Then, with your
last ounce of strength,

21:04.304 --> 21:06.765
you pointed
to "w" and "S."

21:06.848 --> 21:09.226
Wayland Smithers.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.144
Well, I'm just relieved
that Homer's safe,

21:11.228 --> 21:13.814
and that you've recovered
and we can get back to normal.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.482
Not exactly.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.652
Smithers,
for attempting to kill me,

21:18.735 --> 21:22.030
I'm giving you
a five percent pay cut.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.950
Ohh!

21:25.033 --> 21:27.327
But, of course,
for that ending to work,

21:27.411 --> 21:30.497
you would have to ignore
all the Simpson DNA evidence.

21:30.580 --> 21:34.459
(laughing) And that would be
downright nutty.

21:34.543 --> 21:38.380
Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way
since an old drunk made humans

21:38.463 --> 21:41.425
out of his rabbit characters
to pay off his gambling debts.

21:41.508 --> 21:43.260
Who knows what adventures
they'll have

21:43.343 --> 21:47.389
between now and the time
the show becomes unprofitable?

21:47.472 --> 21:49.725
I'm Troy McClure,
and I'll leave you

21:49.808 --> 21:51.727
with what
we all came here to see--

21:51.810 --> 21:53.520
hardcore nudity!
