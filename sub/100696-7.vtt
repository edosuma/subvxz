01:33.301 --> 01:34.594
Dude, we're not going to the Bahamas.

Bahamas is like the fucking Orlando

Okay, well, we're not going to Tahiti.

01:40.934 --> 01:41.768

'Cause if you love your life,
we're not going to DR.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.642
I knew you were gonna say
the worst island possible.

02:22.725 --> 02:24.018
And when talks fail,

02:24.102 --> 02:26.312
the next step is to rally your allies

02:31.109 --> 02:32.485
Not that I have to sell Brazil

02:32.569 --> 02:34.863
because Brazil is Brazil, but you know,

02:35.405 --> 02:36.573
it is Brazil.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.246
Can every single creature
in Australia kill you?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.748
Sure, but that's the price you pay

-Yeah, we do.

03:32.503 --> 03:33.838

It's an island that has
broken glass everywhere,

03:36.466 --> 03:38.635
just little pieces shattered
all over the ground.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.553

03:40.929 --> 03:42.513
"island of broken glass."

03:42.597 --> 03:44.724
Wouldn't you rather go to a place

-Why would I wanna sleep above sharks?
-What is happening?

03:59.614 --> 04:01.699
Why would you even be allowed

04:01.783 --> 04:03.451

Probably, like,

Fine, man.

04:38.778 --> 04:39.946
But how about clownfish?

04:40.029 --> 04:42.198
They also have clownfish
you could sleep above.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.284
Clownfish are way cooler than sharks.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.630
Because that's a great thing.
That means I'm a good parent.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.466
That means it comes down to Brooklyn,

05:41.549 --> 05:43.259

the other day

05:43.343 --> 05:44.761
while he took a shit in his pants.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.513

his credibility is kind of shot.

Agreed.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.419
Like, that's, like, a cargo hold.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.840
Yo, guys, honestly,
fuck that first-class bullshit.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.552
That isn't when we arrive,
this trip is when we arrive.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.263
I really did it.
Set this shit off this time.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.265
Went in my bag and went for it.

09:17.848 --> 09:18.683
[exhales]

09:18.766 --> 09:20.768
I did it. It's PJ time.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.645
It's PJ o'clock. It's...

09:22.728 --> 09:23.938
It's half-past PJ.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.941
PJ's "private jet."
Why didn't I just say, "private jet."

09:27.441 --> 09:29.443
If I'm acting nervous,
it's because I'm nervous.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.696
Private jets are, like, really expensive.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.282
In fact, I've heard people
with a lot of money say

09:34.407 --> 09:35.992
"It's the quickest way to go broke."

09:36.492 --> 09:37.493
Scottie Pippen,

09:37.994 --> 09:40.204
perhaps the greatest swing man
in the history

09:47.795 --> 09:48.713
He's in my head.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.049
I have my concerns.
I mean, that guy could shoot,

09:52.216 --> 09:54.760
defend, rebound,
really just a complete package.

09:55.845 --> 09:56.679
Broke.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.639
Doing what I'm doing.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.145
Fuck it.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.772

10:55.780 --> 10:58.032
The PJ's a flat fee

10:58.115 --> 11:00.201
because the more people that come along,

11:00.409 --> 11:02.870
the less it amortizes out to be,
and if you get enough people,

11:02.953 --> 11:06.749
it's basically cheaper than a commercial
flight, is what I've been telling myself.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.085
Yeah.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.461
It's cheaper.

You don't just pick up
another man's family's bags.

I'm the Dad. I decide who does that.

shrimp and crab for you. Only.

Got the couch option, I see.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.901
Nice white leather.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.529

13:43.155 --> 13:44.740

he just gets to throw on a track suit.

-Just, like, cashews or almonds?
-Yeah. Okay.

-Yes! I wouldn't twerk for everybody.
-Oh, my God.

D. Let me holla at you
for a second, playboy.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.248

are you doing, dude?

-What?
-You don't talk to the help!

16:41.208 --> 16:42.042
But I am the help.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.336
What are you talking about?
No, you're not. You're my family.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.295
Oh, that's nice.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.923
'Cause before when you asked me to
take the picture, I was feeling left out.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.967
Dude, why does everything
have to get weird?

16:50.050 --> 16:52.052
Just don't talk to Peaches.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.220
-Don't talk to her.
-Why?

16:53.303 --> 16:55.681
Because that's Joya's family.
She's a plant.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.600
Joya uses her to get information on me.
Do not talk to her.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.186
She's just helping me
come up with DJ names.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.938
Goddamn it, Danny!

17:03.022 --> 17:05.149
You're not a fuckin' DJ!
Don't you see what's happening?

17:05.232 --> 17:07.735
-I'm sorry, I just don't understand.
-No, you don't understand.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.570
She is using you, dude.

17:09.653 --> 17:12.072
She's making you believe
that you can do anything.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.450
Then she takes all the information.
Next thing you know,

17:14.742 --> 17:15.826
I'm-- I'm dead.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.619
By the way, have you seen this bathroom?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.788
-It's incredible. I'll use the toilet now.
-Incredible.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.915
No, you can't use it. The--

17:21.999 --> 17:24.960
The captain has some rule,
like, only immediate family members.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.795
I thought you said I was your--

17:26.879 --> 17:29.798
No, I'm just saying, like,
this is the captain's rules, not mine.

17:29.882 --> 17:30.758
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.801
But there's a squat pot or something.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.761
That's-- Okay.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.096
Danny? You my family.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.558
No, not that kind of family.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.855
Hi, um, could I get a glass of champagne?

17:46.815 --> 17:49.276
-Sure, let me get that for you.
-Thank you.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.737
So, fake IDs?
That's what we're doing now?

17:52.029 --> 17:55.365
Hey, it doesn't matter anyways.
We're in international waters.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.744
Uh, we're not in the water.
We're in the air.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.913
Okay, how about you get a glass
and loosen up?

18:01.121 --> 18:02.289
I don't like champagne.

18:02.706 --> 18:06.293
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you had such a refined alcohol palate

18:06.376 --> 18:08.796
to not like
the world's most beloved drink.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.589
I like other alcohol.

18:11.006 --> 18:11.924
Like what?

18:13.217 --> 18:14.093
Vodka.

18:14.802 --> 18:15.677
What kind?

18:16.470 --> 18:17.304
Ciroc.

18:17.554 --> 18:18.388
What flavor?

18:19.640 --> 18:20.641
Guava.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.186
You are so lame!

18:24.269 --> 18:26.647
You literally chose the one flavor
that they don't make.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.899
Look, they have apple,

18:28.982 --> 18:30.859
pineapple, red berry,

18:30.943 --> 18:31.860
-amaretto.
-Here you go.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.445
Thank you so much.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.614
You know what?
I don't have to take shit from you.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.909
Peach, limited edition white grape. Yummy!

18:38.992 --> 18:41.286
Yo, I just had a transformative dream.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.206
And it was beautiful.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.165
[Chloe] Mmm.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.128
Okay, they have French vanilla,

18:49.336 --> 18:52.548
mango, pineapple, coconut.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.135
All right.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.595
[laughing]

18:58.762 --> 19:00.973
Come on. You just gotta pull the hand out.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.724
It's a really simple game.
Move your hand.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.434
Are you serious about this clown?

19:04.518 --> 19:06.770
Why did you just call my boyfriend
a clown?

19:06.854 --> 19:09.273
-[Kam giggling]
-I get it. You guys are a college thing.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.859
But it's a college thing
and then it's over, right?

19:11.942 --> 19:13.026
[Chloe] Look at him.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.445
-[Kenya] I'm looking at him.
-He's so cute.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.739
You know who else was cute? Manson.

19:18.198 --> 19:22.077
-Just tell me it's gonna stop soon.
-Dad, it's my choice, okay?

19:22.536 --> 19:24.413
Can we not talk about this right now?

19:25.414 --> 19:27.749
I've always questioned
Chloe's judgment, but...

19:28.125 --> 19:29.084
this is different.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.752
This is scary.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.589
[Marquise] Excuse me, Pops,
can I talk to you for a quick second?

19:33.714 --> 19:34.590
Hey, man.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.135
I just wanna say
this is a really amazing opportunity

19:38.218 --> 19:40.262
and it's so dope
that you put all this together.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.763
It's special.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.515
You know, I don't have a dad.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.143
I mean, I'm not saying
you're my dad. I'm just,

19:46.226 --> 19:48.770
you know, you just have
such a beautiful family and...

19:49.688 --> 19:52.983
I guess I'm just really thankful
you decided to include me in all of this.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.110
So, like, I don't know,
real talk, thank you.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.321
Mm-hmm.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.157
Mmm.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.868
You're a Jamaican dude.
You wanna marry a Swedish model

20:02.951 --> 20:04.119
and move to Pasadena,

20:04.203 --> 20:06.580
that's what your kid's gonna look like.
Remember that.

right over there?

21:33.375 --> 21:34.960
-No.
-No.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.004
[Kenya] Africans don't really fuck
with African-Americans.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.130
They look down on us.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.881
See? Didn't even say hi.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.426
They're kind of better than us

22:04.072 --> 22:05.741
Izzy's always pushing me around.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.367
Not this trip.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.661
This time,
I'm going to stick up for myself.

22:09.786 --> 22:10.787
You know what, Izzy?

I don't think you understand.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.383
-[Pops] Izzy!
-I really don't care what you think.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.894

This is going to take some
getting used to.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.775
I mean, he's just so soft.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.277
It's fine. It's just who I am.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.237
No, it's not fine.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.031
You got to stand up for yourself.

22:46.239 --> 22:48.283
You can't be a victim your whole life.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.079
You see why this guy confuses me?

22:56.249 --> 22:58.460
Um, what is he doing in here?

22:58.960 --> 23:01.296
Um, this is actually me
and Marquise's room, so...

23:01.421 --> 23:02.255
[Kenya laughs] 

23:02.339 --> 23:05.509
No, it is fucking not. Are you crazy?

23:05.967 --> 23:07.386
Nope, not on my watch.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.971
I mean, I'm a cool dad.
I'm not that fucking cool.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.724
You will be staying with your sister
in this room.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.519
And I'm going to be staying with...

23:15.602 --> 23:17.104
I wish you weren't here,

23:17.229 --> 23:19.773
but since you are,
you're going to be staying with Danny.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.650
-Yes!
-Who, unfortunately, only has one bed.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.069
-Respect.
-To Danny.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.990
I sleep in the nude, FYI, so...

23:29.074 --> 23:30.826
-Me too.
-Real life crazy person.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.249
-This is really beautiful, dude.
-Yeah.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.670
It's hot as fuck, though. Did you know
it was gonna be this hot out here?

23:41.753 --> 23:43.255
I mean, yeah. It's an island.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.132
Yeah, I guess that's right.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.633
Yo, man, look.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.261
I need you
to watch Marquise for me. Seriously.

23:49.344 --> 23:51.555
Like, don't let him outta your eyes
this entire trip.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.140
Sweet. That guy has it all figured out.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.684
I feel like I can learn a lot
just by being in his orbit.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.727
Do I have to worry
about you fucking him, too?

23:57.811 --> 23:58.645
What?

23:59.020 --> 24:01.481
Do I have to worry
about you fucking him, too?

24:01.565 --> 24:03.024
He's dating your daughter already.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.652
-I mean, it's not even a--
-That's not the answer, dude!

24:05.735 --> 24:06.570
What do--

24:06.653 --> 24:08.029
-No?
-I mean, he's taken.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.197
[sighs]

24:09.281 --> 24:11.324
Dude, I'm gonna go cut these into shorts.
I'll be back.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.701
-Do you need help?
-No, man!

24:12.784 --> 24:14.119
-I'll hold your--
-What's going on?

24:14.202 --> 24:15.036
Okay, nothing!

24:17.956 --> 24:18.790
[Kenya] Yo, yo!

24:19.833 --> 24:21.168
-[Joya] Yo.
-What's up, cutie?

24:21.251 --> 24:22.711
-Hey.
-How you doing?

24:23.086 --> 24:23.920
Good.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.006
Not bad, right?

24:26.840 --> 24:27.883
Beautiful.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.219
I got that island.
Rented that for us for lunch.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.220
That's ours.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.889
This big island?

24:33.972 --> 24:34.973
No, that...

24:35.807 --> 24:36.808
It's that one.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.935
Was it expensive?

24:39.561 --> 24:42.189
It wasn't cheap. It's an island.

24:43.648 --> 24:46.651
Anyway, you want to go to the beach?
Everybody's hanging out.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.945
-Nah.
-Nah?

24:50.614 --> 24:52.282
We also could, you know, maybe...

24:52.908 --> 24:54.576
Uh, no, I--

24:55.243 --> 24:57.037
I'm just getting situated.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.455
You know, I got to get my bearings.

24:58.538 --> 24:59.748
-Sure.
-Yeah.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.667
This is "vacation mode" for Jo.
She never wants to do anything.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.127
I mean, literally nothing.

25:04.461 --> 25:07.964
The point of vacation
is not to do anything.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.090
To relax.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.969
This is an indication
that I'm in a very good place in my life.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.304
If I wasn't relaxed,

25:14.387 --> 25:16.515
I would be manic and nobody wants that.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.351
The guess the point of this vacation
was to work on our marriage.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.435
She said it was horrible.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.605
You heard her.
She literally said those words, so...

25:24.064 --> 25:25.440
Here I am, working.

25:25.941 --> 25:26.816
On our marriage.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.945
-Um, all right, have a good day.
-Thank you.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.614
We could also do other, like, top stuff
if you want.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.991
No, forget it. All right.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.244
-Have a good day.
-You too.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.037
Doing whatever it is you're doing.

25:40.038 --> 25:40.914
Jump!

25:44.543 --> 25:46.670
-[Peaches] Get in the pool, Brooklyn.
-No.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.089
Get in the pool, you coward.

25:49.172 --> 25:50.257
[Kenya] Yo, babe.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.508
-[Brooklyn] No.
-[Peaches] Come on!

25:51.591 --> 25:53.552
We've got some light.
We should do something, dude.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.555
Like, get on a fucking jet ski
or go snorkel or some shit.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.808
Get one of those stand-up paddle boards
the white dudes be doing.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.476
Nah.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.105
I mean, or we could find, like,
a spot on the beach

26:05.188 --> 26:08.567
kind of secluded, like,
maybe just me and you.

26:08.650 --> 26:09.776
Nah.

26:09.859 --> 26:10.735
[Kenya groans] 

26:10.902 --> 26:11.736
Right.

26:13.321 --> 26:14.823
Yo, my man.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.366
[tapping]

26:16.616 --> 26:18.868
It's gonna fuckin' be a long night.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.746
Just keep the drinks coming,
doubles for both of us.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.624
-Two for me, please.
-Hey, she wants two.

26:28.962 --> 26:29.921
Vacation.

26:31.214 --> 26:33.300
Double team! The double team!

26:33.592 --> 26:35.135
-Dude!
-[guys laughing] 

26:35.218 --> 26:37.846
What are you guys doing? Marquise!

26:37.929 --> 26:38.805
Huh?

26:38.888 --> 26:41.099
I'm just splashing with my bros.
Splash bros.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.519
Okay, well, when you're done
splashing with your bros,

26:44.603 --> 26:48.231
your girlfriend will be over here,
in a bikini, all alone.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.567
-Don't do that, babe.
-Don't do what?

26:50.650 --> 26:52.569
You know,
every single time we go somewhere,

26:52.652 --> 26:54.654
you find some random bros to play with.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.115
Like your meditation bro, Josh from Ojai.

26:57.198 --> 26:59.075
Your yoga bro, Steven from Big Bear.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.535
I miss Steven so much.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.412
[man grunting]

27:02.537 --> 27:03.747
Wait a second.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.082
-Is Marquise bi?
-[Chloe] What?

27:07.876 --> 27:10.128
'Cause that would connect
a lot of dots for me.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.839
You think I'd be with him
if he was into guys?

27:12.922 --> 27:15.050
Do you really think any girl
would be cool with that?

27:15.508 --> 27:16.426
I would.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.844
No, you wouldn't.

27:17.927 --> 27:19.638
[laughing] You don't know what I would do.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.014
Yeah, I do.

27:21.222 --> 27:22.557
When you're sleeping with someone,

27:22.641 --> 27:25.644
you want them to be 100% satisfied
with what you're bringing to the table.

27:26.186 --> 27:29.773
Chloe, bisexuality and monogamy
are not mutually exclusive.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.400
-[laughs]
-What? What's so funny?

27:32.484 --> 27:34.277
Oh, it's not funny, it's hilarious.

27:34.402 --> 27:37.030
Everything you know about sex,
you learned from a TED Talk.

27:37.113 --> 27:39.407
Okay, Peggy Orenstein
is a highly regarded--

27:39.491 --> 27:42.911
Okay, no. I am done being lectured on sex
by a virgin.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.420
-Yo, what's up, dude?
-Nothing. Everything's chill.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.880
-How's it going?
-Good, good.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.965
I was actually gonna ask you
if I could run to my room

27:56.049 --> 27:57.175
and grab some sunscreen?

27:57.258 --> 28:00.261
No, dude! What are you talking about?
You're supposed to be watching Marquise!

28:00.345 --> 28:02.597
I'm sorry, I'm just heating up.
I feel the sun.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.933
There's sunscreen
over by the fucking toilet. It's--

28:05.183 --> 28:06.601
in a pump or some shit.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.478
I don't know what SPF it is.

28:08.561 --> 28:10.897
What the fuck are you talking about, dude?
Just watch Marquise!

28:10.980 --> 28:12.148
Okay, yeah, no problem.

28:14.609 --> 28:16.152
[Kenya]<i> Sometimes it seems like</i>
<i>being white</i>

28:16.236 --> 28:18.863
<i>is like the hardest fucking thing</i>
<i>in the world to be.</i>

28:19.322 --> 28:20.657
Can't even be in the sun.

28:21.157 --> 28:24.452
Like, what kind of fucked up
evolutionary trait is that?

28:25.036 --> 28:26.204
The sun?

28:27.247 --> 28:30.417
How are there so many of them?
How've they lasted this long?

28:31.084 --> 28:32.085
On top?

28:32.502 --> 28:34.254
It's SPF 45, is that enough?

28:34.337 --> 28:37.173
Okay, yeah. No, this'll work.
They didn't have anything for your face?

28:37.257 --> 28:38.967
What the fuck, man? Fuck your face!

28:39.050 --> 28:40.802
-No, no. Fuck my face.
-This is important!

28:40.885 --> 28:42.262
-Yeah, no, I got this.
-Oh, my God.

28:42.345 --> 28:43.430
I got-- I got you.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.808
-Are you reading the ingredients?
-No, no, not at all. No, it's just--

28:46.891 --> 28:49.394
-Just use it!
-Okay, I'll use it. Yep.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.105
This isn't going to work.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.191
This is going to be Aruba all over again.

[R&B playing]

29:01.948 --> 29:05.160
[Drea] <i>For my family,</i>
<i>day one had gone relatively smoothly.</i>

29:05.577 --> 29:08.079
<i>Dinner that night was the first time</i>
<i>we'd gathered for a meal</i>

29:08.163 --> 29:09.873
<i>in probably six months.</i>

29:10.373 --> 29:13.001
So my dad took the opportunity
to make a toast,

29:13.084 --> 29:15.253
and by toast, I mean stand up

29:15.336 --> 29:18.131
and loudly remind us
that he's the reason for all of this.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.467
[clinking]

29:21.050 --> 29:22.302
[Kenya] Thank you guys so much.

29:22.385 --> 29:25.680
Fuckin' love you guys, seriously.
Just wanted to say a couple words.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.934
As I-- I'm reminded as I look out

29:30.518 --> 29:31.770
over this warm

29:32.145 --> 29:33.313
Atlantic Ocean.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.732
This is South--
we're in the South Pacific.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.026
It's the Pacific Ocean.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.652
Same thing. All I'm trying to--

29:39.736 --> 29:42.989
Not the same thing.
It's two different bodies of water.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.449
Opposite.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.660
Right. The point
I was trying to get at is Hawaii.

29:47.994 --> 29:50.914
You know, we are so close to Hawaii
and it just makes--

29:50.997 --> 29:52.457
Not that close to Hawaii.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.876
Not very close at all to Hawaii.

29:55.418 --> 29:57.879
-[Kenya] Right, I--
-[Joya] Same ocean, but...

29:57.962 --> 29:59.798
Beautiful, smart woman. You are right.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.174
Lawyer. That's why I married her.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.509
All I'm saying is Hawaii...

30:02.801 --> 30:05.094
birthplace of Barack Obama.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.471
-[Joya sighing]
-[cell phone vibrating]

30:06.554 --> 30:08.014
[Kenya] That's what that reminds me of.

30:08.264 --> 30:11.392
And I think that, much like Barack,
who is considered a hero...

30:11.476 --> 30:13.603
-Check it!
-Whoa.

30:15.021 --> 30:17.357
-[Izzy] We're going to get that.
-Yeah. Totally.

30:18.107 --> 30:18.983
Not you.

30:19.609 --> 30:23.112
Hey, we might need him to take the fall
if we get busted.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.572
[Kenya continues toast indistinctly] 

30:24.697 --> 30:26.699
I changed my mind. You can come.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.117
Sick!

30:29.160 --> 30:31.871
And what it makes me think about,
when I think about Obama,

30:31.955 --> 30:33.248
is I start to reminisce,

30:33.540 --> 30:35.875
about what a great man he was.
We all miss him.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.836
-[phone vibrating]
-We miss him. I think about him...

30:39.337 --> 30:42.298
frolicking in those sugarcane fields,

30:42.632 --> 30:44.759
that beatific smile, you know, and I--

30:44.843 --> 30:46.094
[Peaches] Beatific smile?

30:46.177 --> 30:47.720
Barack has smoker's lip.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.598
Shit, that's why he was my president.

30:50.807 --> 30:55.019
You think I wasn't gonna vote for somebody
who smoke Newports and blunts?<i> </i>[laughs]

30:55.395 --> 30:56.729
Y'all get it, right?

30:57.981 --> 30:59.983
[Kenya] First of all, Peaches, very funny.

31:00.066 --> 31:02.026
But if you had even woken up

31:02.527 --> 31:04.487
on voting day early enough to vote,

31:04.821 --> 31:07.574
I'm not sure that the ballot you cast
would have counted

31:07.657 --> 31:09.534
because I'm pretty sure

31:09.617 --> 31:11.202
you're a felon.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.913
[Kenya] And secondly, that little outburst

31:13.997 --> 31:17.375
just earned you
what we call a separate check.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.210
Waiter, she's on her own tonight.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.004
So, enjoy that. [clicks tongue]

31:21.087 --> 31:21.921
It's fine.

31:22.005 --> 31:26.009
Anyway, when I think about Barack,
I remember Barack because I think that

31:26.509 --> 31:27.844
Barack was a hero.

31:28.636 --> 31:31.973
And, you know, you guys probably,
because I'm a husband and father,

31:32.181 --> 31:33.391
think of me as a hero.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.978
At this point he'd had six Lava Flows.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.146
Minimum.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.607
But I'm just a man,

31:41.149 --> 31:44.152
and as a man
who happens to be the provider...

31:44.611 --> 31:46.696
sole provider of this family.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.198
And also in family, you learn to tolerate

31:49.699 --> 31:50.742
family.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.869
And people who are not family

31:52.952 --> 31:55.204
and probably will never hopefully be,

31:55.288 --> 31:58.333
if God is a real thing in this world,
family.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.459
[phone vibrating]

31:59.542 --> 32:00.418
[Kenya] But...

32:00.919 --> 32:01.961
Barack Obama...

32:02.086 --> 32:05.298
You know my man, Sean?
He kinda looks like a young Junior Seau?

32:05.965 --> 32:07.967
He was telling me about a party
the locals set up

32:08.051 --> 32:10.094
that's supposed to be dope.
You wanna pull up later?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.555
Yeah, yeah, that sounds cool.
We can just dip out after dinner.

32:12.639 --> 32:15.183
-I might try to get some cardio in first.
-Okay.

32:15.516 --> 32:16.976
Where are we dipping out to?

32:17.060 --> 32:18.937
No, you are not dipping with us.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.939
What? Why?

32:21.022 --> 32:23.358
Because I'm not in the mood
to babysit you tonight.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.818
Oh, you have to babysit me?

32:25.902 --> 32:27.904
Look, we're just all on different paths.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.405
Really?

32:29.572 --> 32:31.991
Because you're so grown-up
and so mature?

32:32.367 --> 32:33.910
College forces you to grow up.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.036
[phone vibrating]

32:35.119 --> 32:38.456
But Barack, like your heroic dad,
is just a man.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.377
And as a man,
you learn very quickly that...

32:42.460 --> 32:43.378
[phone vibrating] 

32:43.461 --> 32:45.505
-I'm sorry. Can you...
-[Joya] Yeah.

32:46.339 --> 32:49.217
-I don't need to get that. I'm all good.
-It's fine. They keep calling.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.510
-I'll get it.
-No, please don't.

-Here we go.
-Can you please call us back?

32:58.810 --> 33:00.228
<i>I know you're on vacation.</i>

33:00.311 --> 33:03.773
<i>I just spent half the afternoon</i>

33:05.650 --> 33:07.777
Why are you talking
to our hotel manager for us?

33:07.860 --> 33:11.698

<i>have some rinky-dink hotel room</i>

<i>-Kenya, come on. Stop it.</i>

33:15.451 --> 33:18.538
All right, Lavette.
I'm just gonna call you back, okay? Bye.

Book event?

33:26.004 --> 33:28.089
Please, don't do this right now. Okay?

33:28.172 --> 33:31.426
Don't do what? Act like
you're the horrible person that you are?
