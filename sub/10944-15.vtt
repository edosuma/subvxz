00:40.192 --> 00:41.359
But no proof.

00:41.427 --> 00:42.894
You already screwed up.

- Cass?
- Yeah.

04:09.188 --> 04:10.555
Why?

She said she was with
Jeremy the entire night

04:11.824 --> 04:12.958

04:13.025 --> 04:13.792
Yeah, I know, but don't you think maybe

04:13.860 --> 04:15.693
she was protecting him?

04:15.863 --> 04:17.129
I mean, now that he broke it off,

04:17.197 --> 04:19.331
she might be less willing
to keep his secrets.

04:19.398 --> 04:20.598

06:49.206 --> 06:51.207
I see ten fewer head of cattle than we own,

you might wanna just park your car,

09:22.782 --> 09:24.150
I tried your cell and you didn't answer,

09:24.217 --> 09:25.717
so I called the house,

09:25.785 --> 09:26.752
and some girl named Mallory
said you were out here.

09:26.819 --> 09:28.387
Oh... 

09:28.455 --> 09:29.921
<i>Lou: Okay, Mr. Morris, ready or not... </i>

09:29.989 --> 09:30.989
<i>Here I come!</i>

09:32.492 --> 09:33.692
Ta-dah!

09:33.760 --> 09:35.293
<i>Peter: Actually, honey, honey!</i>

09:35.361 --> 09:37.029
Oh my... 

09:37.096 --> 09:38.563
<i>Oh my God!</i>

09:38.631 --> 09:40.799
Eden: Clearly, I've come at a bad time.

09:40.867 --> 09:42.100
Hi.

09:42.168 --> 09:43.769
(Laughs)

09:43.836 --> 09:45.137
Yeah, uh, this is... this is Eden.

09:46.706 --> 09:48.106
The ex-wife. (Chuckles)

09:49.074 --> 09:50.841
Hi.

09:50.909 --> 09:52.677
Peter: So, I thought I was
supposed to pick up Max tomorrow.

09:52.744 --> 09:54.211
Did I get the days wrong, or... ?

09:54.279 --> 09:55.846
Eden: No, no, something came up at work,

09:55.914 --> 09:58.382
and I just thought I'd drop him off early.

09:58.449 --> 09:59.684
I hope you don't mind.

09:59.751 --> 10:01.585
Oh no, it's fine.

10:01.653 --> 10:02.953
- Eden: Hey.
- Peter: There he is!

10:03.021 --> 10:04.721
There he is! Come on, bud. Come on.

10:04.789 --> 10:06.389
Aw! How you doing, buddy?

10:06.456 --> 10:09.025
Actually, that's kinda what
I need to talk to you about.

10:09.093 --> 10:10.960
Um... (Clears throat)

10:11.028 --> 10:12.528
Oh, Lou!

10:12.596 --> 10:14.463
It's so nice to have finally met you,

10:14.531 --> 10:15.531
in the flesh.

10:15.599 --> 10:16.866
(Laughs uncomfortably)

10:16.934 --> 10:18.735
Um, well, I do like to make an entrance.

10:18.803 --> 10:20.403
You certainly do.

10:20.470 --> 10:21.970
So, she was just dropping Max off.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.206
And, uh, now she's on her way.

10:24.273 --> 10:25.307
Lou: You know, it's funny

10:25.374 --> 10:26.975
we haven't had a chance to meet yet.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.078
Eden: Well, we should absolutely do lunch.

10:29.145 --> 10:30.879
Yeah, we should absolutely do that.

10:30.947 --> 10:33.582
Eden: Peter, I'm gonna... I'm
gonna call you later, okay?

10:33.649 --> 10:34.750
Um... 

10:34.818 --> 10:36.151
All right, well, you... 

10:36.219 --> 10:38.119
you crazy kids enjoy
the rest of your weekend.

10:38.187 --> 10:39.253
(Laughs)

10:39.321 --> 10:42.656
(Engine sputters, doesn't catch)

10:43.992 --> 10:47.095
I really um... (Engine sputters)

10:47.162 --> 10:48.429
- Peter: Problem, or... ?
- Eden: Um...

10:50.699 --> 10:52.133
Amy: It's okay, Spartan.

10:52.201 --> 10:55.501
We're just gonna go for
a nice, slow walk, okay?

10:55.569 --> 10:56.636
Good boy.

10:58.505 --> 10:59.439
(Low whinny)

10:59.506 --> 11:00.941
What is it?

11:01.008 --> 11:02.142
It's okay.

11:03.211 --> 11:05.178
Ty: What's the matter?

11:05.246 --> 11:06.613
I don't know.

11:06.680 --> 11:10.415
It's like he doesn't want
to go out to the yard.

11:10.483 --> 11:11.483
<i>- Ty: Whoa.
- Amy: Whoa, easy!</i>

11:11.551 --> 11:12.785
<i>Ty: Whoa.</i>

11:13.754 --> 11:15.420
That's weird.

11:15.488 --> 11:16.488
Yeah.

11:19.126 --> 11:21.360
<i>I think he remembers the accident.</i>

11:21.427 --> 11:22.895
What do you mean?

11:22.963 --> 11:24.263
When I took him out of the trailer,

11:24.330 --> 11:26.765
the first thing he saw
was the jumping ring.

11:26.832 --> 11:28.967
Maybe that's why he spooked.

11:29.034 --> 11:30.534
<i>(Cell phone rings)</i>

11:31.503 --> 11:32.703
Sorry.

11:35.174 --> 11:37.175
Hey, Lou... 

11:39.245 --> 11:40.178
Okay, I'll be right there.

11:44.548 --> 11:45.715
Yeah, I can fix it.

11:45.784 --> 11:46.750
But I won't be able to get the parts I need

11:46.818 --> 11:47.918
until the morning, so.

11:47.986 --> 11:49.153
Oh, you really... 

11:49.220 --> 11:50.553
you don't have to go out of your way.

11:50.621 --> 11:52.522
Ty: Oh, it's no trouble, I don't mind.

11:52.590 --> 11:53.957
Thank you, I just think it's best

11:54.025 --> 11:56.160
if I call a tow truck
and head back to the city.

11:56.227 --> 11:57.326
Ty: Well, you're not gonna have much luck

11:57.394 --> 11:58.327
getting a tow truck out here,

11:58.395 --> 11:59.796
<i>especially at this time.</i>

11:59.863 --> 12:00.897
Really?

12:00.964 --> 12:02.799
Yeah, it is pretty late, actually.

12:02.866 --> 12:04.801
<i>Ty: You're better off just
to wait till tomorrow morning.</i>

12:04.868 --> 12:06.135
Okay, well, maybe... 

12:06.203 --> 12:09.305
could I get a lift to a motel in Hudson?

12:09.372 --> 12:10.673
Ty: Why doesn't she just stay here?

12:10.740 --> 12:12.708
Wouldn't that make more sense?

12:12.776 --> 12:13.809
(Laughs awkwardly)

12:15.912 --> 12:18.180
Y... yes... yes.

12:18.247 --> 12:19.681
Yeah, thanks for pointing that out, Ty.

12:19.748 --> 12:21.516
No, no, I couldn't impose on you like that.

12:21.583 --> 12:22.750
Don't be silly,

12:22.819 --> 12:23.618
I don't mind making up one of the cabins.

12:23.686 --> 12:25.020
It's fine!

12:26.222 --> 12:28.856
Well, all right, if you insist.

12:30.625 --> 12:34.361
Mallory: So much for Peter
and Lou's romantic stay-cation.

12:34.429 --> 12:37.731
Yeah, talk about a third wheel.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.433
Lou seemed to handle it pretty well.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.268
You have met my sister, right?

12:41.336 --> 12:42.569
Mallory: If I were Lou,
I'd be freaking out.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.438
Ex-wives never show up with good news.

12:44.505 --> 12:47.273
That's enough gossip for one night.

12:47.341 --> 12:48.808
Yeah.

12:48.876 --> 12:50.543
I'm gonna get some studying done.

12:50.610 --> 12:51.711
All right,

12:51.778 --> 12:53.112
I should probably go check on Spartan.

12:53.180 --> 12:55.715
Thanks for dinner, grandpa.

12:55.782 --> 12:57.750
Well, Mallory, why don't
you finish up in here.

13:00.420 --> 13:02.054
<i>Mallory: What's his problem?</i>

13:02.121 --> 13:03.455
Where do I begin?

13:04.423 --> 13:05.924
Oh, he's been like that all day.

13:05.992 --> 13:07.459
Now that Lisa's out of the picture,

13:07.526 --> 13:10.262
he's turning into a lonely old grump.

13:11.231 --> 13:13.798
I think I know exactly what he needs!

13:13.867 --> 13:15.467
Yeah, a three-wheel scooter,

13:15.534 --> 13:17.335
with a little basket in front?

13:17.402 --> 13:19.103
No, he needs a date.

13:19.171 --> 13:20.037
I'm gonna set him up with somebody

13:20.105 --> 13:21.305
who's perfect for him.

13:21.373 --> 13:23.574
No, Mallory, bad idea. Very bad idea.

13:23.641 --> 13:26.577
And I know exactly how to do it!

13:26.644 --> 13:28.145
It's your funeral.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.950
Peter: Hey, what happened
to the scandalous outfit?

13:34.018 --> 13:36.552
Your ex-wife is what happened!

13:38.289 --> 13:40.090
How is it that she arrives just in time

13:40.157 --> 13:43.226
to ruin the one weekend
we have alone together?

13:43.294 --> 13:44.660
<i>I mean, her timing is incredible.</i>

13:44.728 --> 13:47.931
She must have some kind
of an ex-wife super power.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.298
You're the one who asked her to stay.

13:49.366 --> 13:52.768
Well, I didn't really have a choice, did I?

13:53.703 --> 13:55.371
What is she doing here, anyway?

13:55.438 --> 13:56.772
We share custody of Max, you know that.

13:56.839 --> 13:58.340
She was just dropping him off.

13:58.408 --> 13:59.741
Yeah, but she's never done that before.

13:59.809 --> 14:01.911
I mean, you always pick up Max in the city.

14:01.978 --> 14:03.913
Uh, she said something came up at work.

14:03.980 --> 14:05.346
Well, did she say what?

14:05.414 --> 14:06.981
No, I didn't ask.

14:07.049 --> 14:08.082
(Sighs)

14:15.590 --> 14:17.091
I'm gonna head to bed, okay?

14:17.159 --> 14:18.993
Okay. How's Spartan doing?

14:19.995 --> 14:22.195
He's calmer now.

14:22.263 --> 14:25.132
I hope the hand walking
goes better tomorrow.

14:25.199 --> 14:27.067
And don't you stay up too late, huh?

14:27.135 --> 14:28.335
I won't.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.004
Amy: Hey, um... 

14:32.873 --> 14:34.741
I wish this was under better circumstances,

14:34.809 --> 14:38.844
but I kinda like having
you at the ranch again.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.246
It reminds me of the old days

14:40.314 --> 14:42.881
when I used to dream about
marrying the boy in the loft.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.383
(Laughs)

14:44.451 --> 14:45.884
That's funny,

14:45.953 --> 14:47.753
because I used to dream
about marrying the horsey girl

14:47.821 --> 14:49.488
who used to boss me around.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.589
(Both laugh)

14:57.229 --> 14:58.296
Good night.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.977
(Sighs heavily)

15:13.711 --> 15:17.081
Cassandra: It's just some jerk
from school giving you a hard time.

15:17.148 --> 15:18.115
You didn't say anything, did you?

15:18.183 --> 15:19.850
No, of course not!

15:19.917 --> 15:22.119
But... people talk.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.921
This is gonna follow me around
everywhere I go, isn't it?

15:25.990 --> 15:27.256
I'm always gonna be the
guy who killed a horse.

15:27.324 --> 15:28.458
No, it's just for now.

15:28.525 --> 15:29.692
In a week,

15:29.759 --> 15:32.328
they'll be talking about somebody else.

15:33.263 --> 15:36.565
Cass, I gotta ask you something.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.801
Are you sure that you
didn't see anything else

15:38.869 --> 15:40.136
the night Buckingham died?

15:40.204 --> 15:41.703
Yeah, I'm sure.

15:41.770 --> 15:44.373
Jeremy never left your sight?

15:44.440 --> 15:46.875
L... look, Jeremy didn't
kill his horse, okay?

15:46.942 --> 15:49.544
I mean, he... he couldn't
do something like that!

15:49.612 --> 15:51.079
That's not what I asked you.

15:51.147 --> 15:52.147
Look, Ty, I'm sorry,

15:52.215 --> 15:53.448
but if Scott knew you were here... 

15:53.516 --> 15:54.349
Is there something you're not telling me?

15:54.417 --> 15:55.884
No.

15:55.951 --> 15:57.784
I've got a lot of work to do, so... 

15:57.852 --> 15:59.553
you should go.

16:01.689 --> 16:02.956
(Sighs heavily)

16:07.446 --> 16:09.847
<i>Amy: If Cassandra hadn't let
Jeremy in the clinic that night,</i>

16:09.915 --> 16:11.716
maybe Buckingham would still be alive!

16:11.783 --> 16:13.184
Ty: Say what you want about Cass,

16:13.251 --> 16:15.252
but she'd never let anything
bad happen to an animal.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.587
At least not on purpose.

16:16.654 --> 16:17.654
I just hate you having to take the blame

16:17.723 --> 16:19.323
for something that you didn't do!

16:19.390 --> 16:22.693
What I need is absolute proof
that Jeremy killed Buckingham.

16:22.761 --> 16:24.394
Otherwise, I might as
well have "Terminator"

16:24.462 --> 16:25.995
permanently tattooed on my forehead!

16:26.063 --> 16:28.131
So what're you gonna do?

16:28.199 --> 16:29.232
I don't know.

16:29.299 --> 16:30.566
<i>Lou: Hey, guys.</i>

16:30.634 --> 16:32.135
Um, Ty, I know it's early,

16:32.203 --> 16:33.402
but do you think you could get started

16:33.470 --> 16:35.038
on those car repairs?

16:35.106 --> 16:37.040
I'm my way right now, Lou.
It shouldn't take too long.

16:37.108 --> 16:38.608
Could you be a little more specific though?

16:38.675 --> 16:40.243
Like half an hour? An hour?

16:40.310 --> 16:41.844
I just... I don't mean to be uncharitable,

16:41.911 --> 16:43.378
but I have big plans for this weekend

16:43.446 --> 16:45.114
and they don't include Peter's ex-wife.

16:45.181 --> 16:46.448
So, if you can move this along,

16:46.515 --> 16:47.816
that'd be super.

16:47.884 --> 16:49.251
I'm on it.

16:50.353 --> 16:52.287
And if it's any consolation,

16:52.355 --> 16:54.556
you're way better looking than Eden.

16:54.624 --> 16:57.091
That is so not the point.

16:58.127 --> 17:01.863
(Laughs) Do you think so?

17:01.930 --> 17:03.131
(Scoffs)

17:05.733 --> 17:07.734
<i>Mallory: Okay, pick one of the following:</i>

17:07.803 --> 17:09.837
an afternoon at a baseball game,

17:09.905 --> 17:11.806
a quiet drive in the countryside,

17:11.874 --> 17:13.173
or attending a cooking class?

17:13.241 --> 17:16.009
Oh, I guess... a drive in the country.

17:16.978 --> 17:18.310
Mallory: Okay, next question.

17:18.378 --> 17:20.046
How would you describe yourself... 

17:20.114 --> 17:21.915
an extrovert, or an introvert?

17:21.983 --> 17:23.415
Introvert, extrovert!

17:23.483 --> 17:26.685
Mallory, do you not have
something better to do?!

17:26.753 --> 17:27.686
Come on, Jack,

17:27.755 --> 17:28.988
who's your favourite Beatle?

17:29.055 --> 17:30.222
Jack: Mallory!

17:30.290 --> 17:32.057
Mallory: Ringo, George, Paul, John?

17:34.861 --> 17:37.429
<i>(Birds chirp, wind gusts)</i>

17:40.267 --> 17:41.967
Ty's almost done with your car, so... 

17:42.035 --> 17:43.002
<i>it shouldn't be long now.</i>

17:43.069 --> 17:44.436
Oh thanks, Lou... 

17:44.504 --> 17:46.337
<i>Hey, Lou?</i>

17:46.405 --> 17:47.538
You know, you're every bit as wonderful

17:47.606 --> 17:49.573
as Peter said you were.

17:49.641 --> 17:50.708
Thanks.

17:50.776 --> 17:53.244
I hope we can be good friends.

17:53.312 --> 17:55.213
I... I hope so too.

17:56.148 --> 17:57.248
You know,

17:57.316 --> 17:59.951
all these years I was convinced

18:00.019 --> 18:03.620
Peter wasn't capable of settling down.

18:03.688 --> 18:04.922
Look at him now, he's... 

18:04.989 --> 18:07.357
he's remarried, with a baby,

18:07.425 --> 18:09.793
and he's adopting another. I mean... 

18:09.861 --> 18:12.196
he's really changed for the better.

18:12.263 --> 18:13.363
Hmm.

18:13.431 --> 18:14.497
In fact, if Peter didn't seem so happy,

18:14.565 --> 18:16.833
I might just try to steal him back.

18:16.900 --> 18:17.834
(Laughs)

18:17.901 --> 18:19.101
(Laughs uncomfortably)

18:19.169 --> 18:20.769
(Chuckles)

18:21.504 --> 18:24.473
If you had to choose between
dinner in a fancy restaurant,

18:24.541 --> 18:25.674
a picnic in a park,

18:25.742 --> 18:27.543
or a burger at a fast food joint,

18:27.610 --> 18:29.111
what would you pick?

18:29.179 --> 18:31.780
I don't know, Mallory, none
of that sounds very good.

18:31.849 --> 18:34.716
Mallory: All right, none of the above.

18:34.783 --> 18:36.584
- Done!
- Done what?

18:37.553 --> 18:38.519
I thought it was about time

18:38.587 --> 18:39.855
you got back out there, Jack,

18:39.922 --> 18:42.257
so I created an online
dating profile for you.

18:42.325 --> 18:46.394
Oh, no, no, no! That does not sound good.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.596
Don't worry, Jack, it's
completely anonymous.

18:48.664 --> 18:50.064
I just filled out the questionnaire,

18:50.131 --> 18:51.098
and the website matched you up

18:51.166 --> 18:53.367
with several local singles.

18:53.434 --> 18:54.468
Do you wanna see?

18:54.535 --> 18:55.602
No, I don't.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.938
Whatever you did, undo it!

18:58.006 --> 19:00.074
How else do you expect to meet women, Jack?

19:00.141 --> 19:02.576
The bar? Overpriced matchmakers?

19:02.643 --> 19:04.278
Golden age singles' cruise?

19:04.346 --> 19:07.213
Mallory, my personal
life is my personal life.

19:07.281 --> 19:10.149
We are not having this conversation!

19:10.217 --> 19:13.419
I can't believe you're
not even a little curious.

19:13.487 --> 19:16.089
But if you change your mind... 

19:22.728 --> 19:23.728
(Groans)

19:26.665 --> 19:28.300
(Barn door rumbles)

19:29.735 --> 19:31.036
(Spartan whinnies)

19:31.104 --> 19:32.604
What? It's okay.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.106
Hey, hey.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.908
Hey.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.975
Come on. (Clucks tongue)

19:38.076 --> 19:39.743
<i>You're all right.</i>

19:39.811 --> 19:42.346
I've got something for you.

19:42.414 --> 19:43.480
You want a treat?

19:44.449 --> 19:46.284
(Spartan snuffles)

19:46.351 --> 19:49.453
Come on... you want some of this?

19:49.521 --> 19:51.722
(Spartan blows out breath)

19:55.793 --> 19:58.395
You know, I was kinda hoping
that he was just afraid

19:58.462 --> 20:00.063
of the jumping ring,

20:00.131 --> 20:02.132
<i>but he won't even follow
me out into the back field.</i>

20:02.199 --> 20:05.668
It's like he's terrified to leave the barn.

20:05.736 --> 20:07.003
Amy... 

20:07.071 --> 20:08.405
I know you don't wanna hear this,

20:08.472 --> 20:10.406
but if we can't start
hand walking him soon,

20:10.474 --> 20:13.142
he's gonna get a lot worse.

20:13.209 --> 20:14.243
I know.

20:16.246 --> 20:18.080
Oh, Spartan... 

20:18.148 --> 20:19.649
this is your home.

20:20.717 --> 20:22.151
You're safe here.

20:24.321 --> 20:25.354
(Sighs)

20:40.135 --> 20:41.969
<i>Tim: Jack?</i>

20:42.036 --> 20:44.404
Oh, good news.

20:44.473 --> 20:45.706
I found the missing steers.

20:45.774 --> 20:47.741
They were mixed in with Stumpy's herd.

20:47.809 --> 20:48.943
Good.

20:49.010 --> 20:49.944
<i>Tim: Just like I said!</i>

20:50.011 --> 20:51.545
So you can stop grumbling

20:51.613 --> 20:53.213
about how I don't do my share of the work.

20:53.281 --> 20:54.247
What is that?

20:54.315 --> 20:55.749
It's Mallory's.

20:55.817 --> 20:57.651
Tim: What, you're using technology now?

20:57.719 --> 21:00.454
Jack: No, I've never touched
one of these gizmos in my life.

21:00.521 --> 21:01.554
Let me see that.

21:01.622 --> 21:02.822
Ah-ooh!

21:04.058 --> 21:05.993
"Handsome cowboy looking for... 

21:06.060 --> 21:10.397

into the sunset with?!"

21:10.465 --> 21:12.466
(Laughs)

21:12.533 --> 21:13.733
You're online dating?

21:13.801 --> 21:15.434
I certainly am not!

21:15.502 --> 21:16.935
Well, it sure looks like it!

21:17.004 --> 21:18.670
Well, it's all Mallory's doing.

- Jack: Gimme that!
- Tim: No, no, no, no, no!

21:25.845 --> 21:28.981
I wanna see what lucky ladies... 

21:29.049 --> 21:30.248
you matched up with.

21:33.785 --> 21:35.786
Well, Mallory should mind her own business.

21:35.854 --> 21:36.888
No... 

21:36.955 --> 21:37.889
What just happened there?

21:37.956 --> 21:39.090
Nothing.

21:39.158 --> 21:40.758
No, I know you. Nothing means something!

21:40.826 --> 21:42.060
- No, you don't wanna... 
- Gimme that!

21:42.128 --> 21:44.429

It's Jeremy's. I sort of stole it.

25:44.255 --> 25:45.689
Okay, what am I looking at?

25:45.756 --> 25:47.557
This is his web browser history.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.159
The day before Jeremy's horse died,

25:49.227 --> 25:51.362
he was searching for
information on detomidine.

25:51.429 --> 25:53.597
That's the drug that killed Buckingham.

25:53.664 --> 25:54.999
And this is the site he found.

25:55.066 --> 25:58.767
It has specifics on dosage and application.

25:59.803 --> 26:01.770
Ty, you've gotta tell Scott.

26:05.509 --> 26:06.509
Peter: Okay.

26:07.777 --> 26:08.844
Bye.

26:09.546 --> 26:11.580
Lou, thanks again for everything.

26:13.616 --> 26:14.716
Hmm.

26:14.783 --> 26:16.284
Drive safe, huh? Watch for wildlife.

hits a moose, you're a goner.

26:32.401 --> 26:33.634
I'm gonna go pack.

26:33.701 --> 26:35.936
You mean the stay-cation's over?

26:36.004 --> 26:38.205
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's over.

26:38.273 --> 26:41.808
Well, hey, hey, wait. Listen, I uh... 

26:41.876 --> 26:43.110
I've been meaning to tell you something

26:43.178 --> 26:46.146
and I guess I've kinda been avoiding it.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.813
Uh... Peter... 

26:47.881 --> 26:49.615
I already know!

26:49.683 --> 26:50.983
You do?

26:51.052 --> 26:52.085
What, Eden told you already?

26:52.153 --> 26:53.586
She didn't have to tell me, Peter!

26:53.654 --> 26:56.056
It's pretty obvious
what's been going on here.

26:56.123 --> 26:57.123
It is?

26:57.191 --> 26:58.858
I'm not blind, okay?

26:58.926 --> 26:59.926
W... what are you talking about?

26:59.993 --> 27:02.027
I saw you kissing her!

27:02.095 --> 27:05.864
And it's pretty obvious Eden
got exactly what she came for.

27:05.932 --> 27:07.132
Yeah, she did, Lou... 

27:07.200 --> 27:10.902
she came to tell me that Max is sick, okay?

27:10.970 --> 27:13.905
Really, really sick. That's... 

27:14.974 --> 27:17.809
The vet said that we might have to... 

27:17.877 --> 27:19.044

Oh my God.

27:22.982 --> 27:24.482
he's like our kid, you know?

27:24.550 --> 27:26.317
<i>So naturally she's upset, we both are.</i>

27:26.385 --> 27:27.886
<i>S... so... </i>

27:27.954 --> 27:29.153
there was a kiss,

27:29.221 --> 27:31.856
but not at all what you're thinking.

27:31.924 --> 27:32.924
Poor Max.

27:34.993 --> 27:36.860
I'm just um... (Sniffling)

27:38.930 --> 27:42.199
I didn't wanna tell you like this, but... 

27:43.301 --> 27:45.736
Peter, I'm so sorry.

27:45.804 --> 27:46.770
You were right about one thing, though.

27:46.838 --> 27:49.372
The stay-cation is definitely over.

27:56.780 --> 27:58.114
(Sighs heavily)

27:59.750 --> 28:00.984
Do you remember the little conversation

28:01.051 --> 28:03.052
we had not too long ago?

28:03.120 --> 28:04.954
I literally have hundreds of conversations

28:05.022 --> 28:06.588
with hundreds of
different people every day,

28:06.656 --> 28:09.858
so you're gonna have to
be a little more specific.

28:09.926 --> 28:10.859
The one where I told you to stay out

28:10.927 --> 28:12.094
of Jack's personal life!

28:12.161 --> 28:13.996
Was this over Twitter, or did you text me?

28:14.063 --> 28:16.698
You know what it's about.

28:17.967 --> 28:20.135
Jack needed my help. There you go.

28:20.202 --> 28:22.503
Woman: Oh, thanks.

28:22.570 --> 28:25.506
What was I supposed to
do? Sit by and do nothing?

28:25.573 --> 28:27.942
That's exactly what
you were supposed to do,

28:28.010 --> 28:29.510
but instead you went and stuck your nose

28:29.577 --> 28:30.811
in a place it didn't belong,

28:30.879 --> 28:33.147
and you made a bad situation worse.

28:33.214 --> 28:35.582
It's a dating profile. How bad can it be?

28:35.651 --> 28:36.884
(Groans)

28:39.687 --> 28:41.354
<i>Mallory: Oh no.</i>

28:41.135 --> 28:43.537
Now, I have been on the receiving end

28:43.605 --> 28:45.005
of Jack's wrath and Mallory,

28:45.073 --> 28:47.040
I can tell you it is not pleasant.

28:47.108 --> 28:51.746
So I would suggest that
you find a place to hide.

28:55.850 --> 28:58.551
You're making a very serious accusation.

28:58.619 --> 29:00.286
I know I'm right.

29:00.354 --> 29:03.055
Jeremy took out a massive
insurance policy on Buckingham.

29:03.123 --> 29:05.458
One hundred thousand dollars.

29:05.526 --> 29:08.628
That gives him a hundred thousand
good reasons to kill his horse.

29:08.696 --> 29:10.128
Well, if the police look into this,

29:10.196 --> 29:14.666
they're gonna wanna know how
you got Jeremy's computer.

29:14.734 --> 29:16.802
Look, I'm not naive enough to think

29:16.870 --> 29:19.838
that this proves anything for certain.

29:19.906 --> 29:22.340
I just need to know that
you believe me, Scott;

29:22.409 --> 29:27.244
that you don't think that
I did this to Buckingham.

29:27.312 --> 29:31.015
I think... (Sighs) people make mistakes.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.618
Listen, Ty,

29:33.685 --> 29:36.954
you're young, you're a student.

29:37.022 --> 29:40.892
No one's gonna hold this against you.

29:40.959 --> 29:43.126
Yeah.

29:43.193 --> 29:44.928
Except for you.

29:47.465 --> 29:48.532
Ty, wait!

29:51.035 --> 29:52.235
Jack: And you... 

29:53.871 --> 29:55.705
How's Spartan?

29:55.773 --> 29:59.341
His leg's healing, but... 

29:59.409 --> 30:01.577
I don't know, something's wrong.

30:01.645 --> 30:03.846
He's not acting like himself.

30:03.914 --> 30:05.314
Well, recovering from a broken leg,

30:05.381 --> 30:07.015
that's a long road.

30:07.083 --> 30:09.251
And some horses are never the same.

30:09.319 --> 30:12.955
And some horses bounce right back.

30:13.022 --> 30:15.222
Spartan might not be able to jump,

30:15.290 --> 30:16.858
or even run again.

30:16.926 --> 30:18.927
You don't know that.

30:18.994 --> 30:21.062
I put him through this surgery

30:21.129 --> 30:24.298
and now he's scared and he's hurting.

30:26.034 --> 30:28.603
I was being selfish.

30:28.671 --> 30:29.703
You know... 

30:29.771 --> 30:31.905
maybe I should've just let him go.

30:31.973 --> 30:33.340
Amy... 

30:33.407 --> 30:35.108
you did absolutely the right thing.

30:35.176 --> 30:36.977
You've saved that horse's life

30:37.044 --> 30:39.946
more times than I can count.

30:40.014 --> 30:42.048
You're gonna figure this out.

30:42.116 --> 30:44.451
I don't know.

30:44.518 --> 30:46.353
This time it feels different.

30:49.323 --> 30:50.923
(Ty sighs)

30:50.992 --> 30:52.825
(Door slams)

30:52.893 --> 30:54.059
(Keys clank)

30:55.628 --> 30:56.828
(Gasps)

30:56.896 --> 30:58.330
I helped myself to a beer.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.764
(Clears throat)

30:59.832 --> 31:01.200
I hope that's okay.

31:03.036 --> 31:04.403
Agh!

31:04.471 --> 31:07.672
Oh yeah, and I found your gun, too.

31:07.740 --> 31:09.140
<i>You know, it turns out
you're not the only one</i>

31:09.208 --> 31:11.642
who knows how to pick a lock.

31:18.366 --> 31:20.701
<i>Look, I'm just looking for my laptop.</i>

31:20.769 --> 31:22.570
I'm not looking for trouble.

31:22.638 --> 31:24.204
Uh-huh.

31:24.272 --> 31:26.873
Well, you've got a funny way
of not looking for trouble.

31:26.941 --> 31:28.642
Hand it over.

31:28.709 --> 31:30.109
I'm not kidding around!

31:30.177 --> 31:32.779
All right! Relax, okay?

31:36.050 --> 31:38.284
Just relax.

31:38.352 --> 31:39.686
It's in my bag.

31:48.328 --> 31:50.162
Put it on the counter.

31:53.934 --> 31:55.200
Now sit down.

31:56.837 --> 31:58.303
Sit down!

31:59.271 --> 32:00.705
(Sighs fearfully)

32:03.408 --> 32:08.580
You know, Cass told me some
stories about your stepdad,

32:08.647 --> 32:11.215
and all the time you spent in juvie.

32:11.283 --> 32:13.651
I swear I could hear the violins.

32:13.719 --> 32:14.785
Watch it, man.

32:14.853 --> 32:16.119
All I'm saying is,

32:16.187 --> 32:19.255
you're standing real close to the edge.

32:19.323 --> 32:21.324
Don't make me push you.

32:23.027 --> 32:27.097
Oh, and um... thanks for the beer.

32:27.164 --> 32:28.231
Wait!

32:29.767 --> 32:33.603
Tell me something.

32:33.670 --> 32:35.571
What was it like?

32:35.639 --> 32:37.106
What?!

32:37.173 --> 32:39.942
When you stuck that needle in your horse.

32:40.010 --> 32:43.012
<i>Did you feel anything at all?</i>

32:50.987 --> 32:53.989
<i>(Door slams, glass shatters)</i>

32:54.056 --> 32:56.257
(Sighs heavily)

32:56.325 --> 32:57.659
Oh!

32:59.194 --> 33:00.261
(Sighs)

33:02.564 --> 33:04.464
<i>Amy: We should call the police.</i>

33:04.533 --> 33:05.933
And tell them what?

33:06.001 --> 33:08.368
I stole Jeremy's laptop out of his trailer?

33:08.436 --> 33:09.837
As far as everyone's concerned,

33:09.905 --> 33:11.605
I killed his horse.

33:11.673 --> 33:12.840
This doesn't look good for me, Amy.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.742
- Where are you going?
- To find Jeremy.

33:14.809 --> 33:16.010
What're you gonna do?

33:16.077 --> 33:17.277
To do what I should've
done a long time ago!

33:17.345 --> 33:18.478
You lay one finger on him,

33:18.546 --> 33:20.146
and he's gonna charge you with assault.

33:20.213 --> 33:21.147
Then you'll get kicked out of school,

33:21.214 --> 33:22.549
and Jeremy will have won!

33:22.616 --> 33:23.983
Well, he pretty much already has, Amy!

33:24.051 --> 33:25.351
No, not yet.

33:25.419 --> 33:27.620
There's still other ways
we can get at the truth.

33:27.688 --> 33:29.789
Like what?

33:29.857 --> 33:31.290
Cassandra.

33:32.225 --> 33:34.293
(Sighs)

33:35.929 --> 33:37.729
<i>(Knocking)</i>

33:37.797 --> 33:39.565
- Lou: Hey.
- Peter: Hey.

33:42.035 --> 33:44.703
I was wondering where you guys got to.

33:44.771 --> 33:45.804
Hey, Max.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.141
(Clears throat)

33:50.877 --> 33:52.977
Is there any chance

33:53.045 --> 33:54.479
you can forgive your current wife

33:54.547 --> 33:57.815
for letting her insecurities
get the best of her?

33:57.883 --> 34:00.151
I am still your current wife, right?

34:00.219 --> 34:01.553
It's okay, Lou... 

34:01.620 --> 34:04.189
I should've introduced you
to Eden a long time ago.

34:04.256 --> 34:06.458
I mean, I knew I would meet her eventually.

34:06.525 --> 34:07.991
I just thought that when I did,

34:08.059 --> 34:09.759
I would be wearing more clothing.

34:09.827 --> 34:10.893
(Both laugh)

34:11.829 --> 34:13.297
How's Max?

34:15.699 --> 34:18.835
He's... not doing too good,

34:18.902 --> 34:20.870
are you, buddy?

34:20.938 --> 34:22.106
<i>His arthritis is pretty bad,</i>

34:22.172 --> 34:23.739
and uh, now his kidneys,

34:23.806 --> 34:27.775
so Eden and I are gonna go
and see the vet later today

34:27.844 --> 34:30.045
to discuss our options.

34:30.114 --> 34:33.181
Well, if it's all right with you,

34:34.150 --> 34:35.918
I'd like to be there.

34:38.121 --> 34:40.489
Well, I was hoping you'd say that.

34:40.556 --> 34:41.956
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:42.024 --> 34:44.192
<i>Yeah, that would mean a lot... </i>

34:44.260 --> 34:47.295
to me, and uh... to old Max there.

34:49.197 --> 34:50.864
(Half laughs)

34:52.868 --> 34:54.603
<i>(Door opens)</i>

34:54.670 --> 34:56.536
<i>(Diners chatter)</i>

34:56.605 --> 34:59.873
Hi, Loreen, I've got a message for Mallory.

34:59.941 --> 35:02.443
Could you tell her that I know she's hiding

35:02.511 --> 35:03.810
underneath the counter?

35:06.781 --> 35:09.350
Hey, Jack. Can I get you a menu?

35:09.417 --> 35:10.817
I'm not here to eat.

35:10.885 --> 35:12.418
(Sighs)

35:12.486 --> 35:13.753
I know what you're gonna say,

35:13.820 --> 35:15.388
and in my own defense,

35:15.456 --> 35:17.056
you haven't seemed really happy lately.

35:17.124 --> 35:18.158
Mallory.

35:18.225 --> 35:19.559
So I thought this online profile

35:19.627 --> 35:21.194
would bring some joy to your life.

35:21.262 --> 35:23.663
But instead I picked at an old wound

35:23.730 --> 35:25.165
and I'm so sorry.

35:25.232 --> 35:26.599
Listen... 

35:26.667 --> 35:30.369
I actually came here to say thank you.

35:31.371 --> 35:32.571
You did?

35:32.639 --> 35:35.440
Even though your methods are mighty flawed,

35:35.508 --> 35:38.377
I know your heart's in the right place.

35:38.444 --> 35:43.614
And seeing that picture of
Lisa on the site, it uh... 

35:43.682 --> 35:47.117
made me realize something.

35:47.186 --> 35:49.187
She's moved on.

35:50.556 --> 35:53.057
Maybe you should move on too.

35:53.124 --> 35:55.159
You're probably right about that.

35:55.227 --> 35:56.494
Well, I'd be more than happy

35:56.562 --> 35:57.895
to show you how to use the website.

35:57.962 --> 36:00.763
Mallory, I have managed my own love life

36:00.831 --> 36:02.532
for the past fifty odd years,

36:02.600 --> 36:06.369
and I'm just fine, thank you very much.

36:07.638 --> 36:09.872
But you will erase that profile,

36:09.940 --> 36:10.873
is that clear?

36:10.941 --> 36:12.909
Mallory: Yes, Jack.

36:12.976 --> 36:14.711
<i>It's a shame, though.</i>

36:14.778 --> 36:17.813
<i>Twenty-three women
responded to your profile.</i>

36:17.880 --> 36:19.047
Twenty-three?

36:19.115 --> 36:20.148
Mm-hmm.

36:23.619 --> 36:25.486
I still got it.

36:28.023 --> 36:29.090
(Laughs)

36:31.126 --> 36:32.227
Ty: Listen, Cass.

36:33.195 --> 36:34.562
There's no nice way to say this,

36:34.630 --> 36:36.631
but I think Jeremy used
you to get into the clinic.

36:36.699 --> 36:38.265
- Ty... 
- That's what he does!

36:38.333 --> 36:40.567
He uses people.

36:40.635 --> 36:42.035
Look.

36:42.103 --> 36:45.038
I know you said he never left your side.

36:45.106 --> 36:46.873
But maybe he slipped away
when you weren't looking,

36:46.941 --> 36:48.108
or maybe you got distracted.

36:48.175 --> 36:50.143
Even if that were true,

36:50.211 --> 36:52.312
it doesn't prove anything.

36:52.380 --> 36:54.847
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter!

36:54.914 --> 36:56.982
Because if Jeremy gets
away with killing his horse,

36:57.050 --> 36:59.985
what's to stop him from doing it again?

37:00.053 --> 37:01.587
(Sighs)

37:01.655 --> 37:03.623
I'm worried about this guy, cass.

37:03.690 --> 37:06.292
He's dangerous.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.794
Be careful, okay?

37:15.668 --> 37:17.236
Scott.

37:17.303 --> 37:19.938
I've worked with you
for a really long time.

37:20.006 --> 37:21.807
Maybe I can't prove that I'm innocent,

37:21.875 --> 37:23.341
but I'm good at what I do

37:23.409 --> 37:26.911
and I don't deserve to get fired.

37:26.979 --> 37:29.513
I wish things were different, Ty.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.282
I'm the one you should be firing.

37:33.886 --> 37:37.488
I let Jeremy into the clinic
the night Buckingham died.

37:37.555 --> 37:39.157
What happened?

37:39.224 --> 37:41.292
Cassandra: I wasn't with
Jeremy the entire night.

37:41.359 --> 37:42.558
We ordered takeout from Maggie's,

37:42.626 --> 37:44.127
and he wanted to stay with his horse,

37:44.195 --> 37:47.130
so I left him alone while
I went to pick up dinner.

37:47.198 --> 37:48.564
<i>I was only gone a few minutes,</i>

37:48.632 --> 37:50.133
<i>but when I came back he was acting weird,</i>

37:50.201 --> 37:53.036
and he said he wanted to go home and... 

37:53.104 --> 37:55.138
and then he left.

37:55.206 --> 37:59.208
And then the next morning
Buckingham was dead.

37:59.276 --> 38:01.844
Ty, I'm so sorry.

38:05.282 --> 38:07.149
I didn't wanna believe that Jeremy

38:07.217 --> 38:09.652
could do something like this.

38:12.022 --> 38:15.156
<i>Scott: I'm gonna call the police.</i>

38:16.459 --> 38:18.159
(Sighs heavily)

38:19.529 --> 38:20.796
(Truck rumbles)

38:30.772 --> 38:31.939
(Door slams)

38:32.907 --> 38:34.174
(Ty gasps)

38:35.477 --> 38:36.510
Ty: No way!

38:36.578 --> 38:38.912
This is where his trailer was.

38:39.848 --> 38:40.914
He's gone!

38:43.789 --> 38:44.903
<i>Ty: The police still haven't found Jeremy,</i>

38:45.129 --> 38:46.980
but running just makes
him look even more guilty.

38:47.231 --> 38:48.595
How's Cassandra doing?

38:49.767 --> 38:51.234
Scott had to let her go,

38:51.302 --> 38:53.303
but she'll land on her feet.

38:53.370 --> 38:54.705
Everything turned out for the best,

38:54.772 --> 38:58.008
but I am gonna miss having
you around the ranch.

38:58.076 --> 39:01.744
Actually, my first shift back
at the clinic isn't til tomorrow.

39:01.812 --> 39:03.979
So technically, I'm still your stable hand.

39:04.047 --> 39:06.148
At least for the next twenty-four hours.

39:06.216 --> 39:07.549
That's good,

39:07.617 --> 39:08.784
'cause I could use your
help with something.

39:08.852 --> 39:10.052
See, Spartan still won't come in the yard,

39:10.120 --> 39:12.154
but I managed to get him into the trailer.

39:12.222 --> 39:13.488
So where are we taking him?

39:13.556 --> 39:14.690
Amy: Just up the road.

39:14.758 --> 39:16.025
You're driving.

39:18.728 --> 39:20.995
<i>(Spartan's hooves clop)</i>

39:21.964 --> 39:23.865
Ty: How far do you plan on walking him?

39:23.933 --> 39:26.300
All the way to Heartland.

39:27.837 --> 39:29.704
Are you sure that's a good idea?

39:29.772 --> 39:31.639
What if he freaks out
when he sees the ranch?

39:31.707 --> 39:33.306
Well, do you remember when Caleb

39:33.374 --> 39:34.441
got racked up at the rodeo,

39:34.508 --> 39:35.843
and he was so terrified

39:35.910 --> 39:38.645
that he nearly quit riding broncs for good?

39:38.713 --> 39:40.114
Yeah, but then he got back on the horse,

39:40.181 --> 39:41.514
and faced his fears.

39:41.582 --> 39:44.184
And that's exactly what
Spartan needs to do.

39:44.252 --> 39:45.719
I figure if I walk him in from the field,

39:45.787 --> 39:48.455
then he can't cower in the barn.

39:48.522 --> 39:49.488
But if he freaks out,

39:49.556 --> 39:51.124
he could reinjure himself, Amy.

39:51.191 --> 39:52.391
I know.

39:52.459 --> 39:53.760
But I gotta try.

39:53.827 --> 39:55.161
(Spartan nickers)

39:56.163 --> 39:58.097
Okay.

39:58.165 --> 39:59.398

39:59.466 --> 40:01.300
Ty... 

40:01.368 --> 40:04.503
I think I need to do this alone.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.240
I understand.

40:10.209 --> 40:11.342
Good luck.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.343
