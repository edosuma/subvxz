<i>Charles, my man. Miss me?</i>

00:17.288 --> 00:19.485
Sure, everybody misses
their money manager.

00:19.628 --> 00:20.763
What's up, Bernie?

00:20.800 --> 00:22.292
<i>You wanted me to call when it happened.</i>

00:22.420 --> 00:23.594
<i>You're a millionaire.</i>

00:29.624 --> 00:32.322
<i>We're celebrating
this weekend big time.</i>

00:32.426 --> 00:34.246
- <i>Bring your girl.</i>
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

00:34.393 --> 00:37.298
I'm... I'm right here
with her, actually.

00:37.346 --> 00:40.421
She's... we're rich, babe!

00:41.866 --> 00:43.242
She's really excited about it.

00:43.279 --> 00:45.512
<i>Yeah, you're clearly lying,
but don't worry, bud.</i>

00:45.549 --> 00:47.385
<i>You can afford to fly someone in.</i>

01:01.618 --> 01:04.421
Hey, Denise?

01:07.195 --> 01:09.695
I'm a gentleman, and that's
why there's no expectations

01:09.732 --> 01:11.068
for anything to happen this weekend.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.671
I very much so respect you.

01:12.742 --> 01:15.267
Hey, we were just crazy kids
back in Morristown.

01:15.338 --> 01:17.579
But look at us now.
I'm studying acting at NYU.

01:17.616 --> 01:19.777
You've got your own media empire.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.891
We're like... like, full-on adults.

01:21.978 --> 01:24.598
Exactly, like, we don't need
to let our hormones

01:24.635 --> 01:26.632
rule every moment of our lives.

01:26.767 --> 01:29.987
No, I mean, we're, like, adults.

01:30.376 --> 01:33.641
So, you know,
we could have sex wherever,

01:33.678 --> 01:35.487
whenever we want.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.495
Like your car.

01:38.868 --> 01:40.581
- Right now.
- Is that...

01:40.718 --> 01:42.431
is that legal?

01:47.480 --> 01:50.373
Oh, this is good, this is good.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.275
Yeah, this works, this works.

01:52.352 --> 01:54.330
This is... oh, you're a freak.

01:56.322 --> 01:58.550
Oh, my God!

01:59.351 --> 02:00.968
<i>It's so nice to finally meet you.</i>

02:01.005 --> 02:03.319
Jim has told me
so much about you, Charles.

02:03.356 --> 02:06.234
Like, so much.
Like, more than is appropriate

02:06.271 --> 02:07.890
for a non-relative.

02:08.008 --> 02:09.722
What's that stupid-ass smile?

02:10.073 --> 02:12.306
He's just proud
that he has two black friends.

02:12.737 --> 02:14.626
I'm not going to lie,
it's pretty darn great.

02:14.777 --> 02:16.742
I mean, I may not be ready
for a barbershop,

02:16.779 --> 02:19.033
but no, I can definitely hang
at a cookout.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.415
Yeah, what you going to bring?

02:20.775 --> 02:22.316
Uh, cornbread?

02:22.593 --> 02:23.960
- Ooh, that's...
- No?

02:24.111 --> 02:26.071
That's bad, that's going to
get you thrown out the cookout.

02:26.107 --> 02:27.392
- Bring yourself.
- All right.

02:27.429 --> 02:29.313
- Don't bring anything.
- No, yeah.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.342
Okay, I don't want to cut in
on your time here with Charles,

02:31.379 --> 02:33.171
but I just came from
visiting Matt in the hospital.

02:33.208 --> 02:34.449
He asked when you were coming by.

02:34.486 --> 02:37.018
Me? Uh, how about never?

02:37.248 --> 02:39.823
No, Gabby, he's in a cancer ward

02:39.980 --> 02:42.044
in a hospital in Central Florida.

02:42.081 --> 02:43.699
That's depression cubed, right there.

02:43.736 --> 02:44.880
Triple play.

02:44.899 --> 02:47.659
That is a Russian nesting doll
of abject misery.

02:47.754 --> 02:50.206
I thought new Jim
cared about his fellow man.

02:50.243 --> 02:53.002
If you must know, okay,
the last time I saw the guy,

02:53.039 --> 02:54.563
we almost got into a fist fight.

02:54.646 --> 02:56.904
Now, I know, I know,
it's insane to think

02:56.941 --> 02:59.360
that a bedridden hospital patient

02:59.397 --> 03:00.619
could beat me up, right?

03:00.656 --> 03:01.956
No, I mean, catheter attached,

03:01.993 --> 03:03.692
I would still give Matt
three-to-one odds.

03:04.175 --> 03:05.960
I saw you lose a drunken fight

03:05.997 --> 03:07.745
with a sober 14-year-old.

03:07.905 --> 03:11.030
- She beat the shit out of him.
- She was not that sober.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.306
<i>Charles, we can do anything
you like on this trip.</i>

03:13.343 --> 03:15.402
I've always kind of wanted
to go to GatorLand.

03:15.439 --> 03:16.622
- Fuck, no.
- Okay.

03:16.659 --> 03:19.660
Well, what about Weeki Wachee Springs?

03:19.718 --> 03:21.897
A live mermaid show?
Charles, that's basically

03:21.934 --> 03:23.678
dinner theatre without the dinner.

03:23.754 --> 03:26.608
It's an underwater strip show
aimed at families, come on.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.737
Well, it has to have lasted
for 70 years for a reason.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.505
Yes, as a testimony
to the rich vein of stupidity

03:32.542 --> 03:34.593
that runs right through
the bedrock of this country.

03:34.630 --> 03:37.833
But all this sounds like
your idea of my idea of fun.

03:37.936 --> 03:41.696
- What do you want to do tonight?
- Well, if it were up to me,

03:41.942 --> 03:43.824
Lil' Diazepam, he's a Soundcloud rapper

03:43.861 --> 03:45.374
with a full-face tatt of Steve Jobs.

03:45.411 --> 03:46.631
He just got out on bail,

03:46.668 --> 03:48.286
so he's throwing a midnight rager

03:48.323 --> 03:51.333
in the second largest sinkhole
of East Orlando.

03:51.712 --> 03:54.158
Everything about your
generation terrifies me.

03:54.269 --> 03:55.371
Everything.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.657
Well, your generation
killed the planet.

03:57.832 --> 04:00.417
- And America.
- TouchÃ©.

04:00.471 --> 04:02.272
- Surprise!
- Shit!

04:02.309 --> 04:03.401
Oh, my God.

04:03.438 --> 04:05.413
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.789
Jim, it's so great to meet you.

04:12.829 --> 04:14.189
Apologies about the last-minute visit.

04:14.225 --> 04:17.586
- I just missed him so much.
- I missed you so much.

04:18.863 --> 04:20.161
You know, in Amsterdam,

04:20.199 --> 04:22.650
you have to pay 10 Euros for this show.

04:22.869 --> 04:25.379
Can I ask how the heck
you got in here, darling?

04:25.416 --> 04:26.848
Oh, I sweet talked your super.

04:26.888 --> 04:28.453
Said I was your long-lost daughter,

04:28.499 --> 04:31.233
Ruby Lee, from Hot Springs.
Mama may have been a whore,

04:31.270 --> 04:33.100
but she done with me
the best she could.

04:33.172 --> 04:34.470
I was Alma in "Summer in Smoke"

04:34.507 --> 04:36.215
by Tennessee Williams at ETW this year.

04:36.252 --> 04:38.160
- She was amazing.
- Stop.

04:38.232 --> 04:39.954
I watch her performance
on YouTube all the time.

04:39.991 --> 04:41.332
Do you want to see it?

04:41.665 --> 04:43.257
Do I want to watch a taped performance

04:43.334 --> 04:46.594
of amateur theater on a laptop?
Not right now, no.

04:46.671 --> 04:49.823
We don't have time anyway
because I made dinner.

04:56.943 --> 04:58.796
Well, thank you
for breaking in and cooking.

04:58.833 --> 05:01.576
Denise, that was one
hell of a Bolognese.

05:01.613 --> 05:03.484
Oh, it was my Uncle Mike's recipe.

05:03.667 --> 05:07.118
Mike was a friend of
my parents, or, really my mom.

05:07.211 --> 05:08.785
He filled the gaps created
by my father's

05:08.822 --> 05:10.897
emotional unavailability.

05:11.138 --> 05:13.729
When I found the naked photos
of Mike and my mother,

05:13.991 --> 05:16.048
I was happy for her.

05:16.278 --> 05:18.174
Once I understood what they were.

05:18.282 --> 05:19.820
I was only eight.

05:20.974 --> 05:24.223
Okay, then. Um, well, to Mike.

05:33.129 --> 05:35.320
What does "check the pipes" mean?

05:35.357 --> 05:36.957
"Check the pipes" just means
"check the pipes."

05:36.993 --> 05:39.607
What in blue blazes
is going on in here?

05:39.644 --> 05:41.673
His whore ex-girlfriend is texting him

05:41.710 --> 05:42.996
about checking her pipes!

05:43.033 --> 05:44.801
Why don't you go
check them then, Charles?

05:44.838 --> 05:46.210
Well, I am going to have to do that,

05:46.247 --> 05:47.747
because technically, I'm her landlord,

05:47.784 --> 05:50.693
- so her pipes are my pipes.
- Your pipe is my pipe!

05:50.809 --> 05:53.494
Your body made a promise.
I should have known better

05:53.513 --> 05:55.346
than to give my heart
to someone so easily,

05:55.423 --> 05:57.507
but my heart doesn't know...
oh, get off!

06:01.695 --> 06:03.236
I take it you've had to do that before.

06:03.281 --> 06:05.001
Yeah, I call that maneuver...

06:05.037 --> 06:06.814
Charles! Charles!

06:06.926 --> 06:09.336
I-I call that maneuver the Casper.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.529
Gotten me out of many a sticky wicket.

06:11.606 --> 06:15.447
I've used it on third world
pimps and Sandy Duncan.

06:15.535 --> 06:18.314
The key is to use a heavy
fabric to blunt the blade.

06:18.351 --> 06:21.685
Boy, learned that one from
Sandy Duncan the hard way.

06:21.932 --> 06:23.950
Charles, I love you!

06:24.216 --> 06:26.377
I'm going to break up
with her in the morning.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.024
- I'm sorry, Jim.
- Oh, no worries.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.170
What do you think?
Maybe she tuckered herself out.

06:35.713 --> 06:37.447
- Don't look at me!
- Oh!

06:37.523 --> 06:39.298
Still going, still going.

06:47.411 --> 06:48.835
Charles?

06:51.998 --> 06:53.739
Thank you.

06:53.861 --> 06:55.928
Okay. Watch out.

06:56.837 --> 06:58.231
Hey.

06:59.025 --> 07:00.484
Good morning.

07:01.190 --> 07:03.449
Uh, apologies about last night.

07:03.486 --> 07:05.911
Charles and I were having
some communication issues.

07:05.948 --> 07:07.448
- But...
- Ho-ho.

07:07.570 --> 07:09.290
We fixed them. Right, babe?

07:09.422 --> 07:12.021
Yeah, I mean, I have nothing to hide,

07:12.060 --> 07:13.729
but how is she supposed to know that

07:13.766 --> 07:15.636
if she can't see everything?

07:15.697 --> 07:17.697
So we changed all
my passwords to Denise's.

07:17.931 --> 07:21.184
Uh-huh. Still a little bit concerned

07:21.221 --> 07:23.129
about the whole knife thing, however.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.347
Don't worry, though.

07:24.384 --> 07:25.683
It's never going to happen again.

07:25.922 --> 07:28.273
Just a one-time only outburst, eh?

07:28.755 --> 07:30.942
No, we... we threw away all the knives.

07:31.338 --> 07:32.591
Seriously?

07:33.990 --> 07:35.252
Yeah.

07:39.464 --> 07:42.865
Hey, thanks for this.
Gayle is afraid of needles.

07:42.928 --> 07:45.144
So what are you going to do?

07:45.210 --> 07:46.385
About Charles? I don't know.

07:46.430 --> 07:48.430
I got to be very careful
what I say to him.

07:48.575 --> 07:51.426
I already lost a sister because
I was too honest with her.

07:51.614 --> 07:52.927
Yeah, maintaining friendships

07:52.964 --> 07:54.368
has always been a struggle for me.

07:54.412 --> 07:58.345
In my divorce from rye whiskey,
rye got most of our friends.

07:58.382 --> 07:59.782
Well, you're about
to lose another friend

07:59.801 --> 08:01.123
if you keep my ass
hanging out like this.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.781
- Can you please just let me...
- I'm done.

08:02.925 --> 08:04.792
Great with needles, bad with people.

08:04.866 --> 08:05.923
Jesus.

08:05.982 --> 08:07.911
Sorry, it's just fertility stuff.

08:08.072 --> 08:09.765
Of course, I would rather be
in the ladies room

08:09.802 --> 08:12.536
with a female co-worker,
but I literally have none.

08:12.573 --> 08:14.166
It's fine. I'm a nurse.

08:14.203 --> 08:16.573
That was the smoothest
injection I have ever seen.

08:16.610 --> 08:19.126
Yeah, well, all thanks
to sweet lady ketamine.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.868
Well, I mean, I never
actually lived in a K-hole

08:21.931 --> 08:24.697
in all my years of addiction,
but I did own a timeshare there

08:24.735 --> 08:26.542
for quite a while and boy, oh boy,

08:26.579 --> 08:28.000
were there ever a lot
of blackout dates.

08:29.969 --> 08:32.160
- How you doing, I'm...
- Jim Brockmire.

08:32.198 --> 08:34.164
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:34.592 --> 08:36.423
- Hi.
- The, uh, jacket

08:36.460 --> 08:38.457
and the ketamine soliloquy
gave it away.

08:38.494 --> 08:40.595
- Sure, they would.
- Yeah.

08:40.631 --> 08:42.313
- Which makes you Gabby.
- Hey.

08:42.351 --> 08:44.417
Hi, I'm Maggie Nickols.

08:44.465 --> 08:46.882
I'm Matt Hardesty's oncology RN.

08:46.974 --> 08:48.340
- Oh.
- Yeah.

08:48.377 --> 08:50.136
He's been trying to get me
into baseball,

08:50.173 --> 08:53.693
so he gave me some tickets
and promised me the VIP tour.

08:53.736 --> 08:57.163
I showed her the stack
of big nacho cheese bags.

08:57.263 --> 08:58.746
- Yep.
- Because food science

08:58.783 --> 09:00.449
has always been a hobby of mine.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.787
Specifically non-perishable dairy.

09:02.851 --> 09:05.325
Like, did you know
that Hidden Valley Ranch

09:05.362 --> 09:08.539
was an actual working ranch
in Santa Barbara, California?

09:08.616 --> 09:10.663
- Ah.
- I went there on my honeymoon.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.125
There's nothing like the sweet aroma

09:13.203 --> 09:15.796
of sea spray and buttermilk.

09:16.153 --> 09:17.762
You done?

09:18.354 --> 09:20.180
- Yeah.
- Great. Sorry.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.685
Well, gee, you're not
into baseball, shame.

09:23.151 --> 09:24.534
What kind of things do you like?

09:24.571 --> 09:28.331
Hmm, mystery novels, my dogs, musicals.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.153
I was obsessed with "Bye Bye Birdie"

09:30.190 --> 09:31.428
when I was a kid.

09:31.465 --> 09:34.466
Well, maybe I was just
obsessed with Ann-Margret.

09:34.526 --> 09:37.377
I actually dressed up as her
one time for Halloween.

09:37.897 --> 09:39.479
- You got any pictures of that?
- Oh, yeah.

09:39.516 --> 09:41.814
Because I would love... ow, shit.

09:41.966 --> 09:44.967
Sorry, little behavioral
modification system

09:45.166 --> 09:48.746
that Gabby and I have where
she snaps this band hard

09:48.823 --> 09:50.252
when I say something that I shouldn't.

09:50.349 --> 09:52.574
Yeah, we might have
to upgrade to a push pin.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.726
What I meant to say
was I would love to pay

09:54.763 --> 09:56.063
for the pleasure of your company...

09:56.100 --> 09:57.674
no, ow, okay. With dinner, I meant.

09:57.757 --> 10:00.240
It's okay. I would love to get dinner.

10:00.307 --> 10:01.714
- Great.
- I can't tonight,

10:01.751 --> 10:03.631
but next time you visit Matt,
just stick around,

10:03.668 --> 10:04.859
and we'll figure something out.

10:04.914 --> 10:06.434
I'm kind of surprised
I haven't seen you there

10:06.470 --> 10:08.300
the other times that I visited before.

10:08.417 --> 10:11.018
I've been there pretty much every day.

10:11.098 --> 10:13.381
Oh, well, shouldn't have lied.

10:17.303 --> 10:19.266
Charles, what the hell is this?

10:19.447 --> 10:21.787
Well, you told me to pick
out a card for Matt that says

10:21.824 --> 10:23.327
"I acknowledge that we're enemies,

10:23.397 --> 10:26.203
but I am sad
that death comes to us all."

10:26.343 --> 10:28.527
Yeah, but I'm not sure that Garfield

10:28.564 --> 10:30.826
can shoulder that emotional weight.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.958
- Holy shit, look at that.
- Nermal really sells it.

10:33.995 --> 10:36.505
He does. What do you got there?

10:36.616 --> 10:39.001
Oh, it's a teddy bear for Denise.

10:39.104 --> 10:41.299
I like to keep a few
big gestures in the holster

10:41.375 --> 10:42.845
just in case I screw something up.

10:42.882 --> 10:45.369
Right, boy, good to be prepared

10:45.406 --> 10:48.026
because she's very passionate,
isn't she?

10:48.121 --> 10:51.189
Yeah, that's why the sex is insane.

10:51.478 --> 10:54.796
Oh, yeah? What are you guys into?

10:54.971 --> 10:57.453
BDSM, DDLG role play?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.466
Electro stim? Lucying?

10:59.708 --> 11:01.666
We 69.

11:02.613 --> 11:04.121
And then what?

11:05.531 --> 11:06.864
That's it.

11:06.988 --> 11:10.169
You can't improve upon
the perfect sexual position.

11:10.249 --> 11:13.697
Charles, 69 is objectively
the worst sexual position.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.971
It's nothing but a mouthful of
pubes and nose-full of asshole.

11:17.128 --> 11:20.562
Charles, I have a tattoo of
two lizard 69-ing on my chest

11:20.581 --> 11:21.914
because I asked the artist

11:21.991 --> 11:24.144
for the worst possible
thing imaginable.

11:24.215 --> 11:26.975
You're missing
the crucial element, though.

11:27.238 --> 11:29.491
We do it in public.

11:30.416 --> 11:32.475
We've done it
in nine bathrooms already,

11:32.539 --> 11:34.489
and we've only been dating
for two months.

11:34.798 --> 11:36.354
How does that even work?
What, do you, like,

11:36.541 --> 11:38.644
hold her upside down in a stall?

11:38.917 --> 11:40.757
No, I don't have
the arm strength for that.

11:40.794 --> 11:42.217
We just lie down on the floor.

11:42.534 --> 11:45.811
You 69 on the floor
of public restrooms?

11:45.848 --> 11:48.314
Charles, Bukowski would be ashamed

11:48.351 --> 11:49.667
to write that shit down.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.677
You're probably going to
laugh at me for saying this,

11:51.713 --> 11:52.866
but, like...

11:53.130 --> 11:54.772
it kind of feels like we're soul mates.

11:56.031 --> 11:57.277
How else do you explain

11:57.341 --> 12:00.360
that whenever we 69,
we always cum at the same time?

12:01.107 --> 12:04.215
Um, that she's lying
straight into your dick.

12:04.310 --> 12:08.041
Mm-mm, there are no lies in a 69, Jim.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.140
Your bodies form a circle of truth.

12:10.177 --> 12:13.057
I got to beg you to stop
saying "69," please.

12:13.134 --> 12:14.555
Hey, we'll take these,

12:14.592 --> 12:17.008
and can I also get five dozen roses?

12:17.230 --> 12:19.272
Plus nine more.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.900
Oh, you son of a bitch.

12:24.915 --> 12:26.214
Hey.

12:27.755 --> 12:29.588
Well, you look, um...

12:30.076 --> 12:31.476
like dogshit.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.053
I wish.

12:34.242 --> 12:35.557
Well, come on in.

12:36.203 --> 12:38.763
All right. Where's Maggie?

12:38.800 --> 12:41.025
I didn't... I didn't see her anywhere.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.330
Oh, her shift doesn't start
until after visiting hours.

12:44.546 --> 12:45.967
I asked you to come in because

12:46.004 --> 12:50.534
I wanted to apologize for my behavior.

12:52.318 --> 12:55.519
Are you wearing brass knuckles?

12:56.068 --> 12:57.751
Ah, shit, I forgot I had these on.

12:57.884 --> 12:59.459
Yeah, well, you know, you're always

12:59.496 --> 13:00.921
so damn angry at me all the time,

13:00.940 --> 13:02.980
I figured better safe than
sorry, you know what I mean?

13:03.017 --> 13:06.185
But apparently, no,
I misread your intentions.

13:07.723 --> 13:11.740
Just don't... seriously,
don't make me laugh, Brockmire.

13:12.010 --> 13:14.768
It... it hurts. Listen.

13:14.948 --> 13:18.342
When I got sick, I was angry.

13:19.289 --> 13:20.750
Plus, you were always an asshole,

13:20.826 --> 13:23.310
so I figured it was okay
to be an asshole to you.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.343
Well, sure, yeah, no.
Game recognize game.

13:26.989 --> 13:29.935
Man, I banged on you like a drum, so...

13:30.789 --> 13:33.723
I'm sorry, Jim.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.526
Please.

13:35.642 --> 13:37.222
You know, being...

13:38.141 --> 13:39.844
trapped in this bed,

13:39.881 --> 13:41.164
it's like I'm...

13:42.411 --> 13:45.263
held hostage by regrets.

13:45.542 --> 13:48.111
I'm realizing, even before I got sick,

13:48.148 --> 13:50.131
I made everybody around me suffer.

13:50.231 --> 13:53.847
And now, I'm just all alone.

13:54.814 --> 13:57.667
Okay, but, just...
as far as you and I go,

13:57.704 --> 14:00.692
just... just the apology?
Is... is that it?

14:02.451 --> 14:04.859
- Yeah, that's it.
- All right.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.678
Well, accepted.

14:07.208 --> 14:10.281
And uh, I got you this,
so I'm just going to...

14:10.621 --> 14:13.288
probably feel like every day
is Monday long about now, huh?

14:13.421 --> 14:14.811
Garfield understands.

14:16.421 --> 14:17.699
Jim, you don't have to go.

14:17.741 --> 14:19.425
Make sure you read
the inside of that thing

14:19.462 --> 14:21.402
because it really...
it ties it all together.

14:21.724 --> 14:23.555
I spent my whole life

14:24.278 --> 14:26.094
surrounded by crowds.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.596
Now, I'm by myself.

14:30.110 --> 14:32.387
And I'm staring over the edge.

14:35.148 --> 14:38.031
And I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

14:42.783 --> 14:46.178
I got house guests,
so I got to take a rain check.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.321
Okay, my man?

14:51.355 --> 14:53.035
You're my main man.

15:00.981 --> 15:02.955
Hey.

15:03.060 --> 15:04.351
Hey.

15:04.481 --> 15:06.240
Where's Denise?

15:06.328 --> 15:08.100
We had to freshen up after our tryst

15:08.137 --> 15:10.754
- on the Popeye's bathroom floor.
- Ugh.

15:10.853 --> 15:12.105
How'd everything go with Matt?

15:12.142 --> 15:14.291
Terrible. He cried, Charles.

15:14.328 --> 15:16.012
It was like watching Lincoln cry.

15:16.109 --> 15:19.535
The misery of a nation
poured from those eyes.

15:20.342 --> 15:22.154
Well, I have big news.

15:22.316 --> 15:24.755
I'm going to be moving
to New York to be with Denise.

15:24.848 --> 15:26.514
Oh, boy.

15:26.650 --> 15:29.335
Charles, are you certain
that that's the best idea?

15:29.487 --> 15:31.537
- I knew it.
- Oh, shit!

15:31.667 --> 15:33.411
You are trying to break us up.

15:33.448 --> 15:35.161
I forgot about your whittling knife.

15:35.198 --> 15:36.510
How are you everywhere?

15:36.547 --> 15:38.355
Stop trying to constrain our love.

15:38.527 --> 15:41.348
Denise, uh, um, baby,
let's try and be careful...

15:41.403 --> 15:42.923
All right, Charles,
please, please, please.

15:42.959 --> 15:45.856
She's only using that weapon to
try to hijack the conversation.

15:45.938 --> 15:47.032
Right, Denise?

15:47.069 --> 15:49.044
She has absolutely no intention...

15:49.081 --> 15:50.414
Ow, Mommy!

15:52.261 --> 15:55.435
Oh, my God! What, why?

15:58.282 --> 15:59.807
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God!

16:00.646 --> 16:02.804
- Okay, okay.
- Oh!

16:03.175 --> 16:04.867
- First aid kit, first aid kid.
- Oh, my God.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.176
- First aid kit.
- I... I...

16:07.555 --> 16:09.120
Ow, oh.

16:09.424 --> 16:10.860
Oh, man, Denise.

16:10.965 --> 16:12.485
- You have a...
- Denise...

16:12.522 --> 16:14.307
Denise.

16:14.427 --> 16:15.715
- Denise.
- Yeah, I...

16:15.752 --> 16:16.818
- Denise!
- Yeah.

16:16.855 --> 16:18.170
Sit down.

16:18.393 --> 16:19.742
Um...

16:21.475 --> 16:24.470
Denise, what is going on with you?

16:24.626 --> 16:25.986
I...

16:27.168 --> 16:30.094
I thought I'd discover a home at NYU.

16:30.131 --> 16:32.460
People that understood me.

16:33.319 --> 16:35.292
But then you find out
the boys have a pool going

16:35.329 --> 16:37.031
to see which one of them
can fuck you first.

16:37.068 --> 16:38.892
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's fine.

16:38.989 --> 16:42.258
I can handle it.
You make them respect you.

16:42.473 --> 16:44.214
But then somebody decent comes along,

16:44.251 --> 16:47.320
and... and the next thing
you know, it's true love.

16:47.479 --> 16:50.366
Mm, well, that's very nice, Denise.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.735
What is that from?

16:51.772 --> 16:53.538
Kenneth Lonergan's "Lobby Hero."

16:53.659 --> 16:54.979
It's such a powerful play
in these times

16:55.016 --> 16:56.320
of confident certainty.

16:56.655 --> 16:59.143
Well, no notes, honey.
You were very present.

16:59.248 --> 17:00.524
- Thank you.
- Um...

17:00.595 --> 17:03.137
what is your motivation though, Denise?

17:03.332 --> 17:04.589
He's the only decent person

17:04.627 --> 17:06.386
who's ever wanted
to spend any time with me.

17:06.714 --> 17:08.468
Oh, well, ditto. But, you know,

17:08.505 --> 17:10.263
you're going to lose him, darling,

17:10.458 --> 17:13.125
if every waking moment is this intense.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.961
But that's what being young
and in love is.

17:14.998 --> 17:17.343
It's intense and messy and beautiful,

17:17.380 --> 17:19.713
and we are completely
vulnerable with each other.

17:19.816 --> 17:22.107
Someone as cynical
and closed off as you

17:22.144 --> 17:23.428
wouldn't understand that.

17:23.554 --> 17:26.482
Well, actually, I got
a face-full of vulnerability

17:26.519 --> 17:29.045
from a cancer patient
about an hour ago.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.490
Of course, I turned tail
and ran out of there

17:31.527 --> 17:33.384
about as fast as I could, but...

17:33.421 --> 17:34.647
Wow.

17:34.796 --> 17:36.864
I may have stabbed you,
but I think we both know

17:36.901 --> 17:38.457
who committed the real crime tonight.

17:38.534 --> 17:40.590
Yes, you, Denise. Felony assault.

17:40.794 --> 17:44.128
At most, what I did was
an emotional misdemeanor.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.617
How exactly did this happen?

17:48.913 --> 17:50.896
It was young love
and a whittling knife,

17:50.933 --> 17:52.900
and I got caught in the cross-stab.

17:52.937 --> 17:54.911
Nice grift, by the way.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.725
Getting me to come here to ask you out

17:56.762 --> 17:57.979
so I'd have to talk to Matt.

17:58.016 --> 18:00.166
Mm, I don't feel bad about it at all.

18:00.314 --> 18:02.481
Hey, no, you shouldn't. Shame on me.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.486
I had to be conned and stabbed

18:04.523 --> 18:06.825
into becoming a decent human being.

18:07.313 --> 18:09.780
Is it... are we good? Can I head on in?

18:09.817 --> 18:12.256
Yeah, go ahead. I'll break the rules.

18:12.407 --> 18:13.728
He's up.

18:13.847 --> 18:16.176
So are you going to ask me out or what?

18:17.393 --> 18:18.695
Yep.

18:22.292 --> 18:24.662
The Popeye's bathroom floor?

18:24.699 --> 18:26.129
And he was bragging about it

18:26.166 --> 18:28.425
like he was King Dick
of Pussy Mountain.

18:28.673 --> 18:31.024
69'ing is just weird, you know?

18:31.102 --> 18:33.422
I mean, take turns.

18:33.628 --> 18:35.860
Focus on the task at hand.

18:36.833 --> 18:39.575
My mechanic is not going to fix
my car any better

18:39.612 --> 18:41.589
if I'm sucking his dick.

18:41.651 --> 18:44.154
- Right?
- Well, yeah.

18:44.858 --> 18:48.148
Well, we've survived
our share of wild women.

18:48.185 --> 18:49.669
Your friend will too.

18:49.782 --> 18:51.291
Yeah, but he's not like us, man.

18:51.328 --> 18:53.172
He's a giver, not a taker.

18:53.209 --> 18:55.240
He's going to spend years
trying to fill

18:55.277 --> 18:58.942
her bottomless pit of need,
and it's all my fault, man.

18:59.114 --> 19:00.872
No, his mother taught him

19:00.909 --> 19:03.506
that loving somebody
means trying to fix them.

19:03.785 --> 19:05.834
Instead of helping him
break that pattern,

19:05.871 --> 19:08.655
I just hammered it in.
I made it more permanent.

19:08.795 --> 19:11.860
She's a volatile monologist, all right?

19:11.897 --> 19:15.595
Basically, he found a female
version of me to have sex with.

19:16.809 --> 19:18.769
God damn it,
the whole reason I got sober

19:18.806 --> 19:21.142
was to try to stop hurting...

19:24.783 --> 19:26.141
It's just...

19:26.955 --> 19:28.955
he's like a son to me, you know?

19:30.050 --> 19:31.408
I'm sorry, it's just...

19:31.941 --> 19:34.930
I guess we're even now.
We've both seen each other cry.

19:35.756 --> 19:37.466
Well, technically,
I already saw you cry

19:37.503 --> 19:39.392
at that broadcaster's dinner, so...

19:39.446 --> 19:42.282
- Oh, yeah.
- But fortunately,

19:42.319 --> 19:44.169
the stage four lymphoma will give me

19:44.206 --> 19:46.374
plenty of opportunities
to play catch-up.

19:48.202 --> 19:50.127
Well, I got to
say something to Charles, man.

19:50.184 --> 19:53.097
Even if it means he ends up
hating me forever.

19:53.950 --> 19:56.079
Back in my playing days,

19:56.856 --> 19:59.419
I'd come home from a
road trip and uh...

19:59.456 --> 20:01.915
I'd put on my dad hat.

20:02.109 --> 20:04.878
Try to parent my girls real hard.

20:05.660 --> 20:07.290
It never worked.

20:07.909 --> 20:11.562
They got pissed off, resented me,

20:11.671 --> 20:13.563
and did the exact opposite.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.802
My advice: Only give your opinion once.

20:18.305 --> 20:21.181
And only if he asks for it.

20:24.699 --> 20:26.137
Denise sends her apologies.

20:26.174 --> 20:28.443
She had to rush up to New York
to work on her alibi.

20:29.568 --> 20:33.570
You're unusually un-opinionated today.

20:34.172 --> 20:35.609
You sure there's nothing
you want to say?

20:35.646 --> 20:38.859
No, no, Charles, I'm just...
I'm so happy that you're happy.

20:39.769 --> 20:41.460
Denise did stab you,

20:41.588 --> 20:43.588
so you have 30 seconds
to say your piece.

20:43.696 --> 20:45.013
Charles, your natural tendency

20:45.050 --> 20:46.914
is to fill in the holes
in other people's lives.

20:47.014 --> 20:48.508
Your mother and I are good examples.

20:48.545 --> 20:50.426
You define your self-worth by the abuse

20:50.463 --> 20:52.129
heaped upon you by those around you.

20:52.166 --> 20:53.986
But you're so great
in so many other ways.

20:54.023 --> 20:55.404
I'd hate to see you repeat these same

20:55.441 --> 20:57.771
self-destructive patterns
that I helped put in place.

20:57.808 --> 20:59.715
I want to see you grow
into the kind of adult

20:59.752 --> 21:01.810
that anybody, myself included,
would look up to.

21:01.921 --> 21:03.478
You're an absolute treasure, Charles,

21:03.515 --> 21:05.085
and you deserve the absolute best.

21:05.122 --> 21:06.455
- Five seconds.
- I love and respect you

21:06.492 --> 21:08.020
no matter what, but pre-nup, pre-nup,

21:08.057 --> 21:10.300
- pre-nup, oh, God, pre-nup.
- Time.

21:10.952 --> 21:12.763
And I love you, Charles.

21:13.656 --> 21:15.128
I love you, too.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.905
You know the first thing
I'm going to do

21:18.942 --> 21:20.520
when I get to the Big Apple?

21:21.162 --> 21:24.353
69 on the bathroom floor
of the Staten Island ferry.

21:24.718 --> 21:27.001
Just had to ruin
the nice moment, didn't you?

21:28.526 --> 21:29.841
Little shit.

21:31.341 --> 21:33.157
You're a little shit!
