WEBVTT

00:09.427 --> 00:10.385
<i>You sold the farm?</i>

00:10.386 --> 00:12.637
<i>You had no right!</i>

00:12.638 --> 00:14.931
<i>I'm done letting you ruin my life!</i>

00:14.932 --> 00:16.850
<i>We're not done here!
Come back!</i>

00:18.853 --> 00:20.521
<i>The boys and will stay here.</i>

00:22.732 --> 00:24.525
You should go to hell!

00:25.401 --> 00:27.152
No!

00:27.153 --> 00:29.362
What are you doing?

00:29.363 --> 00:30.823
Give me the phone!

01:09.695 --> 01:10.988
I'm sorry.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.120
Mom!

02:21.767 --> 02:22.976
What we have here in the house

02:22.977 --> 02:24.978
is a pocket dimension,

02:24.979 --> 02:27.522
a geometrically impossible
duplicate of the house

02:27.523 --> 02:29.107
that is accessed through a portal

02:29.108 --> 02:30.359
in the upstairs bedroom.

02:32.403 --> 02:35.196
Right, a pocket dimension, um,

02:35.197 --> 02:38.741
and that is a small...

02:38.742 --> 02:40.161
dimension...

02:41.162 --> 02:42.538
Can I talk to Ken?

02:45.374 --> 02:47.959
Dimensional gateways are in line with the file.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.378
You should be careful, it could be dangerous.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.260
Oh, I think I'll be okay.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.096
I have not had any luck
tracking down Brotzman

03:00.097 --> 03:01.639
or Project Icarus.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.474
I think there's another portal

03:03.475 --> 03:04.726
<i>in the house,</i>

03:04.727 --> 03:06.311
<i>but we haven't figured it out yet.</i>

03:06.312 --> 03:07.645
Any sign of Farah Black?

03:07.646 --> 03:09.772
No, she slipped away, but...

03:09.773 --> 03:11.733
I don't think she's going very far.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.193
<i>Okay, keep your eyes open,</i>

03:13.194 --> 03:14.777
<i>and lock down the entire county.</i>

03:14.778 --> 03:16.237
We're reaching an inflection point,

03:16.238 --> 03:18.990
and some kind of convergence
is probably coming soon.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.493
Oh, Ken, you have a dirty mind.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.872
I will do.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.250
Thanks, Priest.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.044
Keep me... posted.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.795
Or... don't.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.172
What are you guys talking about,

03:34.173 --> 03:35.840
dimensions?

03:35.841 --> 03:39.636
Like a hidden world inside the house.

03:39.637 --> 03:41.262
There were references to something like it

03:41.263 --> 03:44.349
in the old file from the original
Blackwing in the '60s.

03:44.350 --> 03:45.350
Now, they never followed up

03:45.351 --> 03:46.809
after the government pulled funding

03:46.810 --> 03:48.186
from Project Paperclip,

03:48.187 --> 03:50.897
and canceled all of the top-secret programs.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.566
Somebody dropped the ball
back then,

03:53.567 --> 03:55.151
and 50 years later,

03:55.152 --> 03:58.613
looks like a touchdown
on the half court for an interception.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.906
Huh?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.200
I don't play sports.

04:02.201 --> 04:05.328
What does any of that mean?

04:05.329 --> 04:06.412
"Project Paperclip"?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.414
You have got to read the files, man--

04:08.415 --> 04:10.917
Stop telling me

04:10.918 --> 04:11.918
to read!

04:11.919 --> 04:12.794
Can you chill?

04:12.795 --> 04:13.753
No!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.839
No, this is...

04:16.924 --> 04:18.091
argh!

04:18.092 --> 04:19.634
There is no way for a normal person

04:19.635 --> 04:21.428
to understand portals!

04:23.180 --> 04:27.558
Seven people have disappeared,
from here, okay?

04:27.559 --> 04:28.601
They just vanished
from right under our noses,

04:28.602 --> 04:30.186
one of them twice,

04:30.187 --> 04:31.729
and I know for sure

04:31.730 --> 04:36.859
that there are no stupid pockets
in my, like, secure,

04:36.860 --> 04:39.737
like, underground,

04:39.738 --> 04:42.241
like, government facility!

04:44.535 --> 04:46.452
- Are you done?
- Yes!

04:46.453 --> 04:47.578
No!

04:47.579 --> 04:48.871
Maybe, I don't know.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.333
You guys are, like, talking about
inflection points, and convergence,

04:52.334 --> 04:54.086
and I don't know
what any of that means!

04:59.300 --> 05:02.136
What do you know
about Project Lamia?

05:27.244 --> 05:28.119
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

05:28.120 --> 05:29.829
I'm armed! I'm a police officer!

05:29.830 --> 05:31.289
Tina?

05:31.290 --> 05:32.583
It's me! It's Farah!

05:34.668 --> 05:36.002
<i>Gun down?</i>

05:36.003 --> 05:37.129
<i>Please?</i>

05:38.964 --> 05:40.381
Where have you been?

05:40.382 --> 05:42.467
I ran into a little trouble,

05:42.468 --> 05:44.635
but I'll tell you about it.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.137
<i>Okay?</i>

05:46.138 --> 05:47.430
<i>If you put the gun down.</i>

05:47.431 --> 05:49.057
Suzie Boreton was magic.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.224
She was like...

05:50.225 --> 05:51.893
She was-she was like a witch.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.604
She shot flying guillotine
shapes out of a stick!

05:54.605 --> 05:56.314
- You saw that, right?
- I did.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.566
How? How did that happen?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.527
Okay, let's-let's put the gun down.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.031
Sorry.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.742
Everything is going nuts, Farah.

06:07.743 --> 06:08.618
The prisoners are gone.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.744
Like, gone!

06:09.745 --> 06:11.120
Like, they broke out!

06:11.121 --> 06:12.038
Cell phone, not working.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.373
Internet, no.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.999
Every time I listen to the police radio,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.460
it's just government
broadcast emergency shit--

06:17.461 --> 06:19.212
Slow down...

06:19.213 --> 06:20.713
Okay?

06:20.714 --> 06:21.839
You're very heightened right now--

06:22.925 --> 06:24.509
The scissor sword thingie

06:24.510 --> 06:26.010
is missing from the evidence locker,

06:26.011 --> 06:27.011
and the chainsaw too!

06:27.012 --> 06:28.012
And there were dudes, scary dudes,

06:28.013 --> 06:29.972
scary military dudes at the hospital!

06:29.973 --> 06:31.057
Okay, relax.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.350
Breathe.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.185
Okay.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.686
That was Blackwing.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.522
I don't care who that was!

06:37.523 --> 06:38.398
We gotta get outta here--

06:38.399 --> 06:39.858
They won't let us leave!

06:42.444 --> 06:45.363
Todd and Dirk are gone.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.197
I think they went to Wendimoor.

06:47.324 --> 06:50.451
That means we...

06:50.452 --> 06:52.746
have to stop Suzie Boreton.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.206
We're going to go to her house,

06:55.207 --> 06:57.125
and...

06:57.126 --> 06:58.627
we're going to arrest her.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.630
You saw all the crap
she did, right?

07:02.631 --> 07:03.923
She's a witch.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.299
What are we gonna do against that?

07:05.300 --> 07:06.801
Without that wand,

07:06.802 --> 07:08.719
she's just a human being.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.348
I know, it's gonna take
a lot of firepower,

07:12.349 --> 07:13.766
but I think we can disarm her--

07:13.767 --> 07:14.977
Disarm her!

07:15.894 --> 07:17.229
You're crazy!

07:25.946 --> 07:28.990
Farah...?

07:28.991 --> 07:30.075
Where's Hobbs?

07:32.035 --> 07:34.871
This was all a joke, man.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.914
I just took this job as a favor

07:36.915 --> 07:38.459
so I could hang out with him.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.671
He's my best friend.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.257
I'm not supposed to be here!

07:47.551 --> 07:49.552
We have to call someone,
or-or something.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.512
I mean, this is... this is dangerous!

07:51.513 --> 07:53.514
Who's going to protect people?
Who-who's going to help people?

07:53.515 --> 07:54.432
We have to call the police--

07:54.433 --> 07:56.392
Tina!

07:56.393 --> 07:59.021
We are the police.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.174
Gotcha!

08:32.262 --> 08:35.765
Oo ankmahead urtie, oo stupid Baboon!

08:35.766 --> 08:36.766
I'll give you this,

08:36.767 --> 08:38.768
you're very determined!

08:52.324 --> 08:53.824
A Kellum truck?

08:54.910 --> 08:55.868
Ah!

08:55.869 --> 08:57.162
Sort that one out later.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.061
Amanda!

09:22.062 --> 09:23.063
Psst!

09:24.106 --> 09:25.566
Amanda, hey...

09:26.775 --> 09:27.900
Where are we?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.570
Some kind of town.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.697
You passed out just
before we got here.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.908
I thought it was better to let you sleep.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.248
Seriously?
You're giving me the silent treatment?

09:47.546 --> 09:48.921
I know you're upset,

09:48.922 --> 09:50.673
and I'm sorry.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.258
Really, I am.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.926
I'm sorry that your...

09:53.927 --> 09:55.219
that Wonzi was killed.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.596
Wakti.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.764
Her name was Wakti.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.475
And Farson died too,
along with like 20 other people,

10:01.476 --> 10:03.728
right in front of us.

10:03.729 --> 10:04.729
I don't know what you've been doing,

10:04.730 --> 10:06.565
but I've never seen anyone die before.

10:07.983 --> 10:10.569
I really just want you to not be here.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.821
After I heard you
scream on the phone,

10:13.822 --> 10:15.323
everything I've done,

10:15.324 --> 10:16.324
everything,

10:16.325 --> 10:17.408
has been to try to rescue you.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.160
I don't know why I called you.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.369
I was panicking.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.412
I'm sorry I did that.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.581
I didn't mean to make me
your responsibility.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.833
You're my sister.

10:26.877 --> 10:27.919
And?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.922
I mean, what, you thought
that you finding me

10:31.923 --> 10:34.884
would somehow
make everything fine?

10:34.885 --> 10:37.511
We are still not okay,

10:37.512 --> 10:42.892
and now we've been captured
by cartoon people in an alternate dimension.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.436
What do you think has changed?

10:56.907 --> 10:58.825
I have pararibulitis.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.164
What?

11:05.165 --> 11:08.584
I got my first attack
the day you called for help,

11:08.585 --> 11:10.836
and it's been happening
ever since.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.215
Are you for real right now?

11:15.884 --> 11:17.678
I took it like a message.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.430
It-it meant that I...

11:22.224 --> 11:24.768
I couldn't give up, no matter what.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.438
I just wanted to make things right with you.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.900
I thought if I found Dirk,
and I found you,

11:32.901 --> 11:34.403
then everything would...

11:37.030 --> 11:39.323
I don't even know,

11:39.324 --> 11:41.450
work out?

11:41.451 --> 11:43.119
Get normal life back.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.041
Why is that so funny?

11:49.376 --> 11:51.627
Look at where you are.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.714
Didn't you say you
came here through a bed?

11:54.715 --> 11:58.092
I mean, like, you were
ranting at those guys a lot,

11:58.093 --> 12:00.845
but I'm pretty sure
I heard you say "flying car,"

12:00.846 --> 12:03.056
"purple people eater," and "love spell."

12:04.891 --> 12:06.892
What...

12:06.893 --> 12:09.062
do you want to go back
to working at the hotel?

12:11.106 --> 12:12.941
Todd, your normal life is over.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.589
Why are we here?

12:36.590 --> 12:38.633
This is the only
safe room in the facility.

12:45.891 --> 12:49.769
Okay, so...

12:49.770 --> 12:52.480
Project Lamia is a person,

12:52.481 --> 12:53.689
or an entity,

12:53.690 --> 12:55.900
called Mona Wilder.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.110
She's a variable physical non-constant.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.446
Like a...

13:00.113 --> 13:01.572
a shape-shifter.

13:01.573 --> 13:02.740
Yes.

13:02.741 --> 13:03.992
But no.

13:04.534 --> 13:08.245
It's more like she can become anything,

13:08.246 --> 13:09.830
but once she changes,

13:09.831 --> 13:12.416
she begins to forget
who she was originally,

13:12.417 --> 13:15.377
and it takes a bit of a nudge
to bring her back.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.881
She's... most comfortable
as inanimate objects.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.424
When they brought her in,

13:20.425 --> 13:22.384
she'd been a chair for six years.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.637
Are you saying...

13:24.638 --> 13:25.639
Okay...

13:27.390 --> 13:28.766
what are you saying?

13:29.810 --> 13:30.936
Watch this.

13:37.025 --> 13:37.942
There it is.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.652
See it?

13:39.653 --> 13:42.738
This is from the same night
Dirk Gently disappeared.

13:42.739 --> 13:46.201
That toy's eye color changed
when it interacted with Dirk.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.245
And again,

13:49.246 --> 13:50.454
eye color changes,

13:50.455 --> 13:54.250
right before Amanda Brotzman
and Incubus 4 vanished.

13:54.251 --> 13:57.796
You think Mona is the doll.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.339
Yes.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.300
Yeah!

14:03.301 --> 14:04.511
Okay.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.054
The book says

14:07.055 --> 14:08.931
control the pool, the kingdom,

14:08.932 --> 14:11.142
the whole world, will be mine.

14:11.977 --> 14:15.020
You stupid things,
show me how it works.

14:18.942 --> 14:19.985
Fine.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.820
I'll do it myself.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.780
Same way I do everything,
I'll just do it mysel--

14:24.781 --> 14:26.073
Ow!

14:27.409 --> 14:29.952
Tingles.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.577
Oi!

15:11.578 --> 15:12.954
Who's back there?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.127
I can see you.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.714
Now, come over here
and give us a hand, will you?

15:23.882 --> 15:26.133
Top o' the mornin' to you, Guvna.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.762
I be being a normal man
of this place 'ere.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.972
Ahoy, y'all!

15:31.973 --> 15:34.059
It's past noon, ya hoopty frood.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.602
Give us a hand, will ya?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.188
Make yourself useful.

15:40.357 --> 15:44.693
Well, that look like a, uh,
a normal thing to me, compadre.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.697
Damn right.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.617
Gonna be some good separations today.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.785
Snip snap!

15:52.786 --> 15:53.995
Oh...

15:56.581 --> 15:58.791
Don't mind my asking, but, um...

15:58.792 --> 16:00.084
what's it for?

16:00.085 --> 16:03.545
Bring justice to a pair of witchakookoos.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.172
Foreign types,

16:05.173 --> 16:07.508
<i>Trost spies.</i>

16:07.509 --> 16:09.301
<i>Word is</i>

16:09.302 --> 16:10.886
they're brother and sister,

16:10.887 --> 16:12.846
claim to be from another world.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.641
It's all farty butt-talk, if you ask me.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.725
Brother and sister...

16:16.726 --> 16:19.186
"Brother and sister."

16:19.187 --> 16:20.188
Uh--

16:28.989 --> 16:31.156
Who be ye the hand of?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.491
The Trosts...

16:32.492 --> 16:34.201
or The Mage?

16:34.202 --> 16:35.577
We know they are working together.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.538
I told you, we don't work for anybody.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.332
How did ye come to work with the Trosts?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.043
What were those terrible
weapons they wielded?

16:43.044 --> 16:44.420
And where is Panto now?

16:44.421 --> 16:46.088
I met Panto back in my world,

16:46.089 --> 16:48.382
but I have no idea where he is now.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.509
And that hardly counts
as knowing the guy,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.637
or any of the... pink-haired people.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.014
And those things that they were holding,

16:55.015 --> 16:56.473
they're called "guns."

16:56.474 --> 16:57.599
They're from our world.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.851
You keep saying "your world"

16:58.852 --> 17:00.519
as though we're supposed
to believe it.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.854
You think you're the only ones

17:01.855 --> 17:03.731
having a hard time
believing this is happening?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.441
I did not sign up for some kind of

17:05.442 --> 17:07.693
murdery acid-trip ren-fair nightmare.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.028
This is weird for us too!

17:09.029 --> 17:10.155
<i>Todd!</i>

17:17.245 --> 17:19.706
You're Farson's mom, right?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.377
Yeah, I'm sorry for your loss.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.629
I knew Farson.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.339
He was a great person,

17:29.340 --> 17:32.051
but you're wrong
about what happened to him.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.054
He wasn't kidnapped by the Trosts.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.263
Farson told me
he ran away from home

17:36.264 --> 17:38.515
because of all the fighting
between the two families.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.268
But he got captured by those
asshole Kellum Knights,

17:41.269 --> 17:45.647
who then spread the rumor
that it was the Trosts who kidnapped him.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.483
They knew that
that would piss you guys off

17:47.484 --> 17:50.611
and distract you from the real problem.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.614
Their army is coming here.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.703
This is your chance to do
what Farson would've wanted.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.624
Make peace with the Trosts,
and maybe me, and him, and Dirk Gently

18:03.625 --> 18:04.875
can help you save your people before--

18:04.876 --> 18:06.086
Enough!

18:07.962 --> 18:10.548
No more lies.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.690
What did they say?

18:36.282 --> 18:37.909
Execute them both.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.104
Bergsberg Sheriff's department!

19:07.105 --> 19:09.691
We're armed, make yourself known!

19:43.224 --> 19:44.933
<i>...you sit there, Bob,</i>

19:44.934 --> 19:47.311
<i>and rot...</i>

19:47.312 --> 19:50.689
<i>Time and space
are no longer obstacles.</i>

19:50.690 --> 19:52.691
<i>I'm powerful...</i>

19:52.692 --> 19:55.694
<i>I am beautiful!</i>

19:55.695 --> 19:58.572
What kind of trippy crap is this?

19:58.573 --> 20:00.657
<i>You sit there, Bob.</i>

20:00.658 --> 20:02.868
<i>You sit there and rot...</i>

20:02.869 --> 20:05.078
Bob?

20:05.079 --> 20:06.288
Hey...

20:06.289 --> 20:08.041
Hey, bud, you in there?

20:10.168 --> 20:13.212
Jesus, Farah, are those pins?

20:13.213 --> 20:16.340
<i>Time and space
are no longer obstacles.</i>

20:16.341 --> 20:18.383
What is wrong with him?

20:18.384 --> 20:22.638
<i>...well, now I am
going to be a queen!</i>

20:22.639 --> 20:23.805
Farah?

20:23.806 --> 20:25.015
<i>A queen who rules all!</i>

20:25.016 --> 20:26.017
Farah...

20:27.852 --> 20:29.604
The TV's not plugged in.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.732
...prophecy of The Mage...

20:33.733 --> 20:35.442
This is not good, this is not good...

20:35.443 --> 20:37.153
You don't think they're actually
gonna kill us, right?

20:38.988 --> 20:39.905
Wait--

20:39.906 --> 20:40.906
Don't swallow it.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.866
What? Why?

20:42.867 --> 20:44.952
Listen, pararibulitis
works different here.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.246
Wakti was teaching me
how to weaponize my attacks.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.706
Maybe you could do it too.

20:50.500 --> 20:54.462
Well, okay, but I swallowed it, so...

20:56.881 --> 20:58.632
I want you to hit me right now.

20:58.633 --> 20:59.717
What? No!

21:00.843 --> 21:02.344
Ah! What the--

21:02.345 --> 21:03.929
I have gotten too used to this.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.138
I'm too good at controlling my attacks.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.056
Hit me,

21:06.057 --> 21:08.183
maybe we could trigger one,
and I can use it to get us out of here.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.727
Okay, look,
I'm not going to hit you--

21:10.144 --> 21:11.937
Ow! Stop it!

21:11.938 --> 21:12.939
No.

21:13.606 --> 21:14.731
Ah!

21:14.732 --> 21:16.734
That's really starting to hurt now.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.236
Ah!

21:19.237 --> 21:21.488
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry--

21:21.489 --> 21:22.782
Ah, I'm so sorry.

21:23.741 --> 21:24.616
Nothing.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.118
Ah! Jesus!

21:26.119 --> 21:27.828
This is like--

21:27.829 --> 21:28.745
Orlando!

21:28.746 --> 21:30.622
Orlando!

21:30.623 --> 21:32.958
We were in that car for, like, nine hours.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.501
I can't believe you remember that.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.086
- You were, like, a baby--
- You always say that.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.170
I was, like, seven years old.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.424
You know what's really crazy?

21:40.425 --> 21:41.383
What?

21:41.384 --> 21:43.177
Oh!

21:44.429 --> 21:45.430
Ow!

21:53.021 --> 21:54.563
Okay.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.816
I don't think this is gonna work.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.576
Her cardio has got to be legendary.

22:10.747 --> 22:11.748
Aah!

22:20.506 --> 22:22.591
Why is your hair black?

22:22.592 --> 22:25.719
Oh, uh, it's, like, a disguise,

22:25.720 --> 22:27.679
a crappy disguise.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.765
Farah and I were
on the run for months.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.809
Did anything happen
between you guys?

22:33.394 --> 22:34.853
Yeah, actually.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.480
What?

22:36.481 --> 22:37.731
How?

22:37.732 --> 22:40.067
She is so out of your league.

22:40.068 --> 22:43.195
Um, hey, you're the one
who drove off in a van

22:43.196 --> 22:45.530
with a bunch of drunk
magic homeless dudes.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.656
What, you think that--

22:46.657 --> 22:48.033
No, absolutely not.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.827
The Rowdy 3, they're like
a whole different type of thing.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.747
I was just worried about you.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.798
You know you hurt me, right?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.427
You were my hero.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.309
How do I get my brother back?

23:14.936 --> 23:16.479
'Cause I want him back.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.858
But I look at you, and, like...

23:22.193 --> 23:24.070
do I even know this person?

23:25.655 --> 23:27.115
I'm sorry.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.410
I'm trying.

23:32.203 --> 23:35.081
Well, we're gonna die
in about an hour, so...

23:36.416 --> 23:37.999
try harder.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.004
<i>...you sit there, Bob.</i>

23:43.005 --> 23:44.256
Oh, God.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.758
<i>...you sit there and... rot.</i>

23:46.759 --> 23:49.553
What do you think is wrong with him?

23:49.554 --> 23:52.305
I think he's in some kind of trance.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.391
<i>I am beautiful!</i>

23:54.392 --> 23:57.769
And I think
the TV is doing it to him.

23:57.770 --> 23:58.895
<i>I am going to be a queen!</i>

23:58.896 --> 24:02.482
What, like, some kinda magical... TV?

24:02.483 --> 24:04.234
Okay, okay, yeah, sure.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.986
Help me get him out of here.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.529
Okay, let's go.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.365
Hello, ladies.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.369
Can he see us?

24:14.370 --> 24:16.121
<i>Yes, indeed I can.</i>

24:16.122 --> 24:17.289
Lucky me!

24:17.290 --> 24:20.417
Unfortunately, I'm already elsewhere.

24:20.418 --> 24:24.463
<i>The face you see here is just a spell,</i>

24:24.464 --> 24:25.839
a curse, in fact.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.299
I understand if you're confused.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.676
There's so little magic in your world.

24:29.677 --> 24:31.219
You're The Mage.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.805
You gave Suzie the wand.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.932
My, aren't we a sharp knife?

24:35.933 --> 24:37.267
Someone's been paying attention.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.102
We'd like to have a word with her.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.521
<i>Oh,
I'm sure you would.</i>

24:41.522 --> 24:44.566
Unfortunately, Suzie has
already gone to Wendimoor.

24:44.567 --> 24:48.570
<i>I have decided that that world
is no longer worthy of my attention.</i>

24:48.571 --> 24:50.530
I hope you don't mind
if I excuse myself.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.240
In fact, I'm going to excuse
both of you, too.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.618
<i>Kill them, Bob.</i>

24:54.619 --> 24:57.329
- Oh, my God!
<i>- Kill them, Bob!</i>

24:57.330 --> 24:58.622
<i>Kill them, Bob!</i>

24:58.623 --> 24:59.706
<i>Kill them, Bob.</i>

24:59.707 --> 25:01.750
<i>Kill! Kill!</i>

25:01.751 --> 25:03.251
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

25:03.252 --> 25:04.337
<i>Both of them.</i>

25:11.302 --> 25:12.887
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

25:14.138 --> 25:16.348
Mr. Boreton, I don't want
to have to kill you--

25:28.361 --> 25:29.862
<i>Kill them, Bob!</i>

25:30.863 --> 25:32.322
<i>Kill them, Bob.</i>

25:32.323 --> 25:34.074
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

25:34.075 --> 25:35.367
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

25:35.368 --> 25:36.284
<i>Both of them...</i>

26:05.982 --> 26:07.024
Aah!

26:09.277 --> 26:11.236
It's that British guy
from the thing the other time!

26:11.237 --> 26:12.237
You?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.573
You are gonna hate your situation!

26:14.574 --> 26:15.991
Get away from me!

26:17.118 --> 26:18.785
Whoa! Whoa...

26:19.662 --> 26:20.495
What is that?

26:22.915 --> 26:23.957
Listen, listen--

26:23.958 --> 26:25.875
Listen-- Stop, no--

26:25.876 --> 26:27.837
No--

26:32.216 --> 26:34.676
I am--

26:34.677 --> 26:38.096
I have never hit anyone before,

26:38.097 --> 26:39.556
and...

26:39.557 --> 26:41.516
Oh, I do not know what to do now.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.643
And-and to you, Beast,

26:43.644 --> 26:44.978
I am sorry.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.688
I have been rude.

26:46.689 --> 26:52.152
I have become a violent...
young... or youngish, man--

26:52.153 --> 26:54.946
and my face feels very hot,

26:54.947 --> 26:57.282
and my hand might actually be broken,

26:57.283 --> 26:59.076
and so...

27:00.786 --> 27:02.329
Don't hit me?

27:02.330 --> 27:03.748
We're looking for the boss?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.124
Little guy with black hair.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.083
Amanda.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.543
Amanda has been captured.

27:08.544 --> 27:09.836
She and her brother are captured,

27:09.837 --> 27:11.421
and they are going to be executed.

27:11.422 --> 27:14.675
Yeah, well, we'll have to get
the drummer outta that lickity-split.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.178
All right, boys,
let's go kick some ass.

27:18.179 --> 27:19.262
Ha ha!

27:19.263 --> 27:20.722
Let's go beat the crap outta everybody!

27:20.723 --> 27:21.848
Yeah, I love beatin' up crap--

27:21.849 --> 27:23.475
No, no, wait, listen to me!

27:23.476 --> 27:25.352
<i>You don't even know where they are.</i>

27:25.353 --> 27:26.603
There are too many people

27:26.604 --> 27:29.481
for you to try and rescue
Amanda and Todd alone.

27:29.482 --> 27:32.150
You're risking their lives,
and your own.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.235
So?

27:37.865 --> 27:39.200
You got a better idea?

27:40.242 --> 27:42.035
Yes.

27:42.036 --> 27:43.621
Yes, actually, I do.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.540
I have a plan.

27:48.542 --> 27:49.377
Good.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.296
Ow!

27:53.172 --> 27:54.882
Okay, this guy's in charge.

27:55.716 --> 28:01.763
<i>♪ Mr. Sandman bring me a dream ♪</i>

28:01.764 --> 28:04.767
<i>♪ Make her the cutest
that I've ever seen ♪</i>

28:06.936 --> 28:11.856
<i>♪ Give her two lips of roses and clover ♪</i>

28:11.857 --> 28:16.653
<i>♪ And tell her that her
lonely nights are over ♪</i>

28:16.654 --> 28:18.446
<i>♪ Sandman ♪</i>

28:18.447 --> 28:22.284
<i>♪ Mr. Sandman bring me a dream ♪</i>

28:24.995 --> 28:26.664
Where is The Mage?

28:27.915 --> 28:28.957
Huh.

28:28.958 --> 28:32.544
Where... is... The Mage?

28:32.545 --> 28:33.920
Huh.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.130
Uh, you keep getting louder and louder,

28:35.131 --> 28:36.047
and it ain't changing his answer.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.133
Can I try somethin'?

28:44.348 --> 28:45.890
Okay.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.767
Hey, Bob, you know me, right?

28:47.768 --> 28:49.602
Huh.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.855
Um...

28:51.856 --> 28:54.733
Okay, so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna play tequila-talk, okay?

28:54.734 --> 28:55.692
You know what that means?

28:55.693 --> 28:57.485
That means if you want to say "yes,"
you just make a noise,

28:57.486 --> 28:59.195
and then to say "no," you just--

28:59.196 --> 29:01.322
Sound good?

29:01.323 --> 29:02.408
Huh.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.953
Did your wife do this to you?

29:07.621 --> 29:08.622
Huh.

29:09.665 --> 29:12.126
Is she coming back from Wendimoor?

29:14.670 --> 29:16.379
Is that a... I mean...

29:16.380 --> 29:17.505
No, no, no, it's working,
that was a "no."

29:17.506 --> 29:19.257
She's not coming back.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.219
Okay. Is The Mage still here?

29:23.596 --> 29:24.512
Huh.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.473
Oh, good. Good job, man.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.976
Okay, wh-what is he doing?

29:34.315 --> 29:35.565
Okay, Bob,

29:35.566 --> 29:38.735
Bob, buddy, I really, really,
really need your help, okay?

29:38.736 --> 29:40.361
The sheriff is missing, and we don't--

29:40.362 --> 29:41.363
Huh.

29:41.822 --> 29:44.199
What? What did you just say "yes" to?

29:44.200 --> 29:45.826
Do you know where Hobbs is?

29:46.827 --> 29:48.161
- Huh.
- Oh.

29:48.162 --> 29:49.996
- Okay.
- Tina--

29:49.997 --> 29:51.165
Okay...

29:53.959 --> 29:55.293
Bob...

29:55.294 --> 29:56.420
look at me.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.630
<i>Okay.</i>

29:58.631 --> 30:00.298
I need you to remember
that drunk and disorderly

30:00.299 --> 30:02.217
where I looked the other way.

30:02.218 --> 30:03.593
I just caught Scott with weed,

30:03.594 --> 30:05.595
<i>I didn't even so much
as write him a ticket.</i>

30:05.596 --> 30:06.554
<i>I just took the drugs.</i>

30:06.555 --> 30:07.972
'Cause I'm a good friend.

30:07.973 --> 30:11.142
Okay, I need you
to do something for me now.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.269
I need you to reach deep down inside

30:13.270 --> 30:15.230
and do one thing for me, okay, man?

30:15.231 --> 30:16.064
Because I've been there.

30:16.065 --> 30:17.482
I have been so out of it

30:17.483 --> 30:18.983
that I didn't know what was going on,

30:18.984 --> 30:21.319
<i>but I did it, I reached through,
I found words,</i>

30:21.320 --> 30:24.239
I need you to do the same, please.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.449
Hobbs is in trouble, he needs our help.

30:26.450 --> 30:27.617
He's your friend too.

30:27.618 --> 30:29.370
Please, just find the words.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.165
Are you...

30:33.874 --> 30:35.083
Are you--

30:35.084 --> 30:36.085
K...

30:37.294 --> 30:38.295
wor..

30:39.839 --> 30:41.131
eee...

30:42.132 --> 30:43.591
Quarry?

30:43.592 --> 30:45.718
Did you just say "quarry"?

30:45.719 --> 30:47.053
- Huh.
- Oh!

30:47.054 --> 30:48.179
Hobbs is at the quarry!

30:48.180 --> 30:50.056
Good work, officer!

30:54.353 --> 30:55.896
Hey, Todd?

30:57.815 --> 30:59.149
I just...

31:00.484 --> 31:01.986
I'm scared.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.696
Me too.

31:04.697 --> 31:05.865
Here comes the queen!

31:14.582 --> 31:16.875
Good people of Inglenook!

31:16.876 --> 31:20.503
You have lived under the dark cloud of war
for far too long.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.255
<i>But do not be fooled!</i>

31:22.256 --> 31:25.216
The true threat to our lives

31:25.217 --> 31:27.719
lays with the uncivilized Trosts--

31:27.720 --> 31:29.262
Yes!

31:29.263 --> 31:32.348
<i>--and those magical creatures
they consort with in the woods.</i>

31:32.349 --> 31:34.601
But do not fret...

31:34.602 --> 31:38.021
the chaos ends today!

31:43.485 --> 31:44.694
Yeah!

31:44.695 --> 31:46.864
<i>Hell, yeah! Come on!</i>

31:49.283 --> 31:50.867
Let's rage, gingerbread!

31:50.868 --> 31:52.994
I have no idea what's going on here!

31:54.038 --> 31:56.539
Take a picture!
We're big heroes!

31:56.540 --> 31:58.583
Looks like a nice place to wreck, boys!

31:58.584 --> 31:59.876
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

32:01.587 --> 32:03.380
Go! Get them!

32:08.385 --> 32:09.844
Sorry for the inconvenience.

32:11.055 --> 32:12.306
Oh, my God!

32:12.973 --> 32:13.890
'Lo dere.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.106
I knew you'd show up!

32:22.107 --> 32:23.066
You did?

32:23.067 --> 32:24.442
I accepted it as a possibility, yeah.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.318
Oh, good!

32:28.364 --> 32:29.906
Halt!

32:29.907 --> 32:31.950
I order you to surrender.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.284
Silas, we're on your side!

32:33.285 --> 32:35.162
You put your hands on my mother!

32:36.372 --> 32:38.082
I won't let you do this.

32:41.502 --> 32:43.086
I have to be brave.

32:43.087 --> 32:44.254
No.

32:44.964 --> 32:48.300
It is I who am the...
have to be being the brave one.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.220
En garde, sir!

33:00.854 --> 33:02.147
I got him on the butt!

33:18.998 --> 33:20.833
No, no, no, no...

33:23.210 --> 33:24.670
Ooh, no, no, no--

33:35.889 --> 33:37.265
I got you on the arm!

33:37.266 --> 33:38.808
You have to give up now,
because I got you on the--

33:38.809 --> 33:40.226
Ow!

33:40.227 --> 33:41.102
Shit!

33:41.103 --> 33:42.104
Dirk!

33:42.396 --> 33:43.397
Dirk?

33:46.191 --> 33:47.567
Are you Dirk Gently?

33:47.568 --> 33:48.569
Hi.

33:51.613 --> 33:52.530
Silas!

33:52.531 --> 33:53.532
Quickly!

33:57.119 --> 33:58.871
Boys!

34:05.753 --> 34:08.212
Beast! Beast!

34:08.213 --> 34:10.257
Beast! Beast! Come on!

34:17.181 --> 34:20.350
- Wigofenz!
- Wigofenz.

34:25.481 --> 34:27.065
Oh good, you're awake.

34:27.066 --> 34:28.816
I've been informed
you're Panto's boyfriend,

34:28.817 --> 34:30.109
and as I always say,

34:30.110 --> 34:31.527
any boyfriend of Panto's

34:31.528 --> 34:33.697
is someone I might meet
in another dimension.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.370
Are you really Dirk Gently?

34:41.371 --> 34:42.663
He really is.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.415
I really, really just so am,

34:44.416 --> 34:46.959
and I have just
one question for you, Silas,

34:46.960 --> 34:49.754
how long has the feud
between your two families been going on?

34:49.755 --> 34:51.464
Three generations,

34:51.465 --> 34:52.632
since the beginning of time.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.760
Wait, since the beginning of time,
or three generations?

34:55.761 --> 34:56.803
Both.

34:56.804 --> 34:57.970
Because for this place,

34:57.971 --> 35:01.641
the beginning of time
is three generations ago.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.059
You solved the case.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.060
Oh, my God, I forgot to tell you,

35:04.061 --> 35:05.813
I solved the case. Ha!

35:06.772 --> 35:07.772
May I?

35:07.773 --> 35:09.900
- Yes, please.
- Yeah, obviously.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.821
In the 1950s
in the town of Bergsberg,

35:14.822 --> 35:17.323
a family named the Cardenases,
with one son, Arnold,

35:17.324 --> 35:20.660
were shocked when they discovered
a baby in a boat in the middle of nowhere.

35:22.412 --> 35:23.830
Then, out of the kindness of their heart,

35:23.831 --> 35:27.416
they took in this baby boy,
but bad call, arguably,

35:27.417 --> 35:30.044
because it turns out
this baby had, stay with me,

35:30.045 --> 35:32.255
godlike reality-warping powers

35:32.256 --> 35:34.632
that activated
whenever he fell asleep,

35:34.633 --> 35:36.008
basically his dreams would come true,

35:36.009 --> 35:38.762
but in a bad, scary way,
not a beautiful inspiring one.

35:41.181 --> 35:43.558
All the weirdness The Boy
was causing in Bergsberg

35:43.559 --> 35:45.601
attracted the attention
of a government agency,

35:45.602 --> 35:47.145
the predecessor to Blackwing.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.897
This, of course, was stressful
for the Cardenases,

35:49.898 --> 35:51.357
who didn't know how to handle
The Boy's powers,

35:51.358 --> 35:52.942
and were arguing
with each other already

35:52.943 --> 35:55.778
over whether or not to sell the farm
to the Kellum Corporation.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.989
I can't believe I'm able to follow this.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.032
Kellum...
named for The Mage Kellum?

36:00.033 --> 36:01.535
Hmm, not quite.

36:01.910 --> 36:05.580
I don't understanding anything
that's happening here,

36:05.581 --> 36:07.123
and I love it.

36:07.124 --> 36:08.583
I love Bibbit.

36:08.584 --> 36:12.253
Tensions in the Cardenas house rose
until they finally exploded.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.797
She came home with a new car,
having agreed to sell the farm,

36:14.798 --> 36:16.132
they argued, and,

36:16.133 --> 36:20.053
gasp, Marina Cardenas
killed her husband with a pair of scissors.

36:22.764 --> 36:24.807
Very bad move, for multiple reasons,

36:24.808 --> 36:27.351
but mainly because The Boy freaked out

36:27.352 --> 36:29.270
<i>and retreated into a dream-state,</i>

36:29.271 --> 36:30.438
<i>launching his mother into the sky,</i>

36:30.439 --> 36:33.566
putting his father inside a tree
on the farm he loved so much, and--

36:33.567 --> 36:36.068
Is there, like, a whole new case going on?

36:36.069 --> 36:38.321
The case is the same case as we're in now,

36:38.322 --> 36:40.156
which to you, is new.

36:40.157 --> 36:43.910
See, after their parents were dead,
that left Arnold, the older brother,

36:43.911 --> 36:45.953
alone with The Boy.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.580
Arnold was understandably traumatized

36:47.581 --> 36:48.915
after losing both his parents,

36:48.916 --> 36:51.626
so he called the number
the government agency had given them,

36:51.627 --> 36:53.127
and turned The Boy in.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.087
That's what Arnold must've
been trying to tell us,

36:55.088 --> 36:56.964
the thing he feared
never being forgiven for,

36:56.965 --> 36:58.049
betraying his brother.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.091
Ding!

36:59.092 --> 37:00.509
But... a wrinkle.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.511
The stress of being taken away
by the men in black

37:02.512 --> 37:06.182
made The Boy try to use his power
at a scale he never had before.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.518
He tried to make his fantasy real.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.102
The mural...

37:10.103 --> 37:12.688
He created Wendimoor,

37:12.689 --> 37:15.233
an entire dimension, in an instant,

37:15.234 --> 37:17.735
with its own people, its own magic,

37:17.736 --> 37:19.238
from The Boy's own mind.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.114
So...

37:22.115 --> 37:24.533
all of us here are just...

37:24.534 --> 37:27.203
figments of a scared child's mind?

37:27.204 --> 37:28.412
No!

37:28.413 --> 37:30.748
No, no, you are real people,

37:30.749 --> 37:32.500
with real lives.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.877
The Boy's waking dream was like...

37:34.878 --> 37:37.880
the Big Bang that created this universe.

37:37.881 --> 37:40.925
The sheer power of that creation
caused an energy surge--

37:40.926 --> 37:42.843
that was the '67 Event--

37:42.844 --> 37:45.096
and threw The Boy himself into a coma,

37:45.097 --> 37:47.890
leading this world
to fall slowly into chaos

37:47.891 --> 37:49.392
without its rightful ruler,

37:49.393 --> 37:51.936
which it has done
and will continue to do

37:51.937 --> 37:54.940
until The Boy is returned here.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.566
Done!

37:57.567 --> 37:58.985
Did it!

37:58.986 --> 38:00.319
I'm making it a thing.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.571
Did it!

38:02.239 --> 38:04.282
This nerdy bullshit

38:04.283 --> 38:06.284
sounds exactly like
the kind of nerdy bullshit

38:06.285 --> 38:07.827
I'd expect you to be involved in.

38:09.413 --> 38:13.457
Wait, so who is Suzie Boreton?

38:13.458 --> 38:15.334
Well. Listen.

38:15.335 --> 38:16.252
I don't know, Todd,

38:16.253 --> 38:18.087
you've got the one thing
I don't know there,

38:18.088 --> 38:20.464
but listen, I hate her so much--

38:20.465 --> 38:23.092
Wait, so how does
any of this help us?

38:23.093 --> 38:25.344
Because I know who,
and, more importantly,

38:25.345 --> 38:27.389
where The Boy is.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.182
He's Project Moloch.

38:30.183 --> 38:31.600
He's in Blackwing.

38:31.601 --> 38:35.146
He's been there the whole time.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.231
Wakti...

38:37.232 --> 38:39.150
Oh, my God, Wakti,

38:39.151 --> 38:41.485
she said that she had
a friend in Blackwing,

38:41.486 --> 38:43.613
and that she was able to look there.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.574
Mona Wilder!

38:46.575 --> 38:48.451
That was Mona Wilder!

38:48.452 --> 38:50.328
We can...

38:50.329 --> 38:51.579
You're saying

38:51.580 --> 38:53.372
we can fulfill the Prophecy.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.499
You could return The Boy
and save Wendimoor!

38:55.500 --> 38:57.126
Yes.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.128
If we could get to Blackwing, sure,

38:59.129 --> 39:01.006
that's where The Boy is, but--

39:01.757 --> 39:03.008
Drummer can do that!

39:03.675 --> 39:06.719
What? You?
You can get us into Blackwing?

39:06.720 --> 39:09.889
I mean, I literally
learned how to do that yesterday, but...

39:09.890 --> 39:10.932
Todd--

39:11.516 --> 39:13.143
Todd!

39:17.314 --> 39:20.775
Everything is connected.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.626
Yes.

39:38.627 --> 39:42.172
Everything is connected.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.357
Stay close to me.

40:01.358 --> 40:02.567
Right.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.031
That's Hobbs' car.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.075
That's The Mage.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.285
What's he doing?

40:26.967 --> 40:30.720
We are going to have so much fun.
