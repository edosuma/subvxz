AND SET IT FREE

10:51.867 --> 10:54.000
FAR, FAR AWAY
FROM MY HOTEL.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.300
BUT SHE'S ALREADY FREE.
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
HURTING HER.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.800
RELAX. ARWIN HAS
EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

10:59.800 --> 11:04.500
I'M HIT! I'M HIT!
DON'T COME OUT HERE!

11:05.934 --> 11:08.100
LOOK. SHE TOOK OFF.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.400
OH. SHE'S FRIGHTENED.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.734
BUT THIS IS SPLENDID.

11:11.734 --> 11:13.567
NOW SHE WILL FIND
ANOTHER HOME,

11:13.567 --> 11:15.300
AND SHE CAN LAY
HER EGG THERE.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.500
EXCEPT SHE'S ALREADY
LAID HER EGG HERE.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.700
DON'T STARE.
YOU'LL SCARE THE EGG AWAY.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.767
WELL, WHAT IF
SHE DOESN'T COME BACK?

11:29.767 --> 11:32.500
WHO'S GONNA HATCH HER EGG?

11:32.500 --> 11:33.600
I WILL.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.967
OK. BUT I'D
SQUAT REALLY LOW

11:35.967 --> 11:38.400
'CAUSE IT CAN GET
PRETTY WINDY UP THERE.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.400
OK, I BROUGHT A BLANKET
AND A HOT WATER BOTTLE.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.200
NO. DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MOTHERING?

11:48.200 --> 11:51.200
APPARENTLY NOT.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.600
IF YOU TOUCH THE EGG, IT WILL
GET THE HUMAN SCENT ON IT,

11:53.600 --> 11:55.600
AND THE MOTHER
WILL NEVER COME BACK.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.867
LET ME AT IT.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.567
WELL, HOW LONG
CAN IT SURVIVE
WITHOUT BEING KEPT WARM?

11:59.567 --> 12:01.834
NOT MUCH LONGER.

12:01.834 --> 12:04.100
OH, THIS IS GREAT STUFF
FOR OUR WEB SITE.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.500
YOU KNOW, I MISSED
THAT LAST EXCHANGE

12:06.500 --> 12:08.600
WHERE MR. MOSEBY TRIED
TO SCRAMBLE THE EGG.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.500
SO CAN YOU GUYS
REENACT IT?

12:10.500 --> 12:13.100
AND THIS TIME, CODY,
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO TEAR UP A LITTLE.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.400
AND GO.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.367
IS THE MOTHER BACK YET?

12:22.367 --> 12:23.734
NO.

12:23.734 --> 12:26.934
DON'T WORRY.
I MADE THIS SLING
TO HELP CRADLE THE EGG

12:26.934 --> 12:29.500
AND KEEP IT
AT HAWK TEMPERATURE.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.734
HOW DO YOU TAKE
A HAWK'S TEMPERATURE?

12:31.734 --> 12:34.000
VERY CAREFULLY.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.767
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA DO THIS?

12:42.767 --> 12:46.000
YES. I HAVE TO.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.200
HEY, I FELT IT MOVE.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.734
THE CHICK MOVED
INSIDE THE EGG.

12:50.734 --> 12:53.834
THERE'S LIFE IN ME.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.000
MADDIE, WHAT
HAVE YOU GOT

13:02.000 --> 13:04.967
THAT'S FULL OF FAT, SUGAR,
CHOCOLATE, AND PEANUTS?

13:04.967 --> 13:06.233
MY AUNT BESSIE.

13:06.233 --> 13:08.400
I'D RATHER HAVE
A CANDY BAR.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.000
ROUGH DAY AT SCHOOL?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.567
YEAH, AND IT'S
ALL CODY'S FAULT.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.200
WHY? IS EVERYBODY
MAKING FUN OF YOU

13:13.200 --> 13:15.700
BECAUSE YOUR TWIN BROTHER
IS HATCHING AN EGG?

13:15.700 --> 13:19.100
OH, NO. ALL THE GIRLS
ARE GOING GA-GA OVER HIM,

13:19.100 --> 13:21.834
AND NONE OF THEM
WILL TALK TO ME.

13:21.834 --> 13:24.667
REALLY, LADIES.
I COULD HAVE CARRIED
MY OWN BOOKS.

13:24.667 --> 13:27.600
OH, BUT WE WANTED TO.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.100
FOR THE SAKE OF THE BABY.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.800
YOU SEE?

13:32.800 --> 13:34.300
YOU'RE BOTH SO SWEET.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.500
OH, YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO'S SWEET.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.200
REALLY SWEET.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.834
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO BE SO SWEET AND KIND

13:41.834 --> 13:42.967
AND CARING?

13:42.967 --> 13:44.233
YES. WHERE?

13:44.233 --> 13:46.400
FROM ME.

13:47.567 --> 13:50.967
YOU KNOW, CODY USED TO BE
ALL MEAN AND MACHO

13:50.967 --> 13:53.100
UNTIL ONE DAY I CAME UP
TO HIM AND SAID,

13:53.100 --> 13:55.200
"HEY, DUDE, STOP IT."

13:58.100 --> 13:59.967
SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING, CODY.

13:59.967 --> 14:00.967
WE'LL WALK YOU
TO SCHOOL.

14:00.967 --> 14:02.567
I'LL BRING ALONG
SOME BREAKFAST.

14:02.567 --> 14:04.233
ANYTHING BUT EGGS, OK?

14:04.233 --> 14:06.400
IT JUST WOULDN'T
SEEM RIGHT BECAUSE OF--

14:06.400 --> 14:09.100
THE BABY.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.867
UH, REALITY CHECK, GIRLS.
IT'S NOT A BABY.

14:16.867 --> 14:21.300
IT'S A BIRD,
WITH A BEAK AND CLAWS.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.700
JUST ONCE, ONCE,

14:27.700 --> 14:30.200
COULD YOU BACK ME UP
ON THE SENSITIVE GUY THING?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.300
HEY, WATCH IT.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.600
I'M WITH CHILD.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.834
CAN YOU MAKE IT
DO SOMETHING?

14:44.834 --> 14:46.734
IT'S AN EGG.

14:46.734 --> 14:50.500
WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO DO,
STUPID EGG TRICKS?

14:50.500 --> 14:52.200
CAN IT?

14:52.934 --> 14:54.967
HE'S GOING TO LOVE IT.

14:54.967 --> 14:57.700
CODY, I MADE SOMETHING
THAT IS GONNA HELP YOU
BOND WITH THE BABY.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.934
CODY, FOR THE RECORD,
I AM ALL IN FAVOR
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE,

14:59.934 --> 15:02.000
BUT THIS TIME
I THINK ARWIN'S GONE
A LITTLE TOO FAR.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.834
THIS IS NOT
GOING TOO FAR.

15:06.967 --> 15:08.300
WAY TO GO, ARWIN.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.367
NOW BUBBA WILL
RELATE TO OTHER HAWKS
INSTEAD OF HUMANS.

15:11.367 --> 15:14.600
CAW! CAW! CAW!

15:18.033 --> 15:21.200
CODY, I HAVE
ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD
TO BECOMING A GRANDMA.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.834
OF COURSE I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE OLDER AND MARRIED

15:23.834 --> 15:26.233
AND YOUR BABY
WOULD BE HUMAN.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.800
THIS IS NICE, TOO.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.734
OH.

15:29.734 --> 15:30.867
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:30.867 --> 15:34.700
MY EGG. I THINK
IT'S...IT'S OPENING.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.467
MY WATER BROKE.
OH, MY GOSH!
I'M GIVING BIRTH!

15:37.467 --> 15:39.467
OK, EASY. BREATHE.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.467
OK, NOW, UH...
NOW, PUSH.

15:41.467 --> 15:42.667
PUSH WHAT?

15:42.667 --> 15:45.000
I DON'T KNOW.
I SAW IT IN A MOVIE.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.934
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
Arwin: I KNOW.

15:46.934 --> 15:48.900
THE MIRACLE OF BIRTH.

15:48.900 --> 15:52.033
NO. I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW
MUCH MONEY WE'RE GONNA MAKE.

15:53.667 --> 15:58.233
FOR THE SAVE
THE HAWK FOUNDATION.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.367
OH, IT'S COMING.
IT'S COMING.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.600
[CAWING]

16:06.600 --> 16:08.400
THE BABY'S HERE.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.100
AND HE'S GONNA BE
A BIG STAR.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.500
I DON'T CARE.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.033
AS LONG AS HE HAS
4 TALONS ON EACH FOOT,

16:14.033 --> 16:16.200
I DON'T CARE.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.834
MADELINE, I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE

16:20.834 --> 16:23.367
THAT YOU HAVE PUT
YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT
THIS HAWK MATTER ASIDE

16:23.367 --> 16:25.600
AND ARE CONDUCTING YOURSELF
IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.000
WELL, I AM YOUR EMPLOYEE,
AND SO I OWE YOU MY LOYALTY.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.867
[BEEPING]

16:30.867 --> 16:32.867
BUT NOW IT'S 5:00.

16:32.867 --> 16:36.100
I'M OFF DUTY,
AND I OWE YOU NOTHING.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.500
TIPTON HATES HAWKS!
TIPTON HATES HAWKS!

16:39.500 --> 16:40.867
MADELINE, WOULD YOU--

16:40.867 --> 16:42.400
MADDIE!

16:42.400 --> 16:43.834
OOH!

16:43.834 --> 16:47.300
YOU CANNOT PARADE
AROUND HERE WITH THAT SIGN.

16:47.300 --> 16:51.367
AS A CITIZEN OF THESE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA--

16:51.367 --> 16:55.100
WHOSE PROUD SYMBOL
IS THE BALD EAGLE,
BEST FRIEND TO THE HAWK--

16:55.100 --> 16:57.567
I HAVE A RIGHT
TO EXPRESS MYSELF FREELY.

16:57.567 --> 17:00.567
AS DO I.
AND AS MAITRE D',

17:00.567 --> 17:02.600
I DEMAND THE IMMEDIATE
REMOVAL OF THAT BABY HAWK

17:02.600 --> 17:04.133
BEFORE IT PRESENTS
A REAL DANGER

17:04.133 --> 17:05.900
TO LIFE, LIBERTY,
AND MY DAILY SPECIAL.

17:05.900 --> 17:06.667
BIRD HATER!

17:06.667 --> 17:07.467
BIRD HUGGER!

17:07.467 --> 17:09.400
BOTH OF YOU
NEED TO CALM DOWN.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.867
I TALKED TO THE ZOO,

17:10.867 --> 17:12.867
AND THEY'RE WILLING
TO TAKE THE BABY HAWK
AS AN HONORED GUEST.

17:12.867 --> 17:15.100
BRILLIANT SOLUTION.
EVERYONE'S HAPPY.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.467
I KNOW CODY,

17:16.467 --> 17:18.367
AND HE'LL NEVER PUT
HIS BABY IN A CAGE.

17:18.367 --> 17:21.000
OH, WELL, MAYBE THE ZOO
WILL ALSO TAKE THE TWINS.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.967
O HAPPY DAY!

17:26.200 --> 17:28.100
ARE YOU GONNA
FEED BUBBA NOW?

17:28.100 --> 17:29.734
'CAUSE I WANNA
GET THAT ON TAPE.

17:29.734 --> 17:30.734
YEAH.

17:30.734 --> 17:33.100
IS THAT A NEW CAMERA?

17:33.100 --> 17:34.600
TOP OF THE LINE.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.700
PALM-SIZED.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.500
HOW DID YOU AFFORD THAT?

17:38.500 --> 17:42.400
WELL, I JUST DIPPED
INTO THE SAVE THE HAWK
FOUNDATION A LITTLE BIT.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.934
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:43.934 --> 17:47.367
ALL THAT MONEY WAS
SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE SAVE
THE HAWK FOUNDATION.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.834
MY SAVE THE HAWK FOUNDATION.

17:50.834 --> 17:51.867
ZACK.

17:51.867 --> 17:53.000
OK, OK.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.767
I'LL GIVE 20%
TO A REAL HAWK CHARITY.

17:55.767 --> 17:56.367
20?

17:56.367 --> 17:57.834
FINE. 50%.

17:57.834 --> 17:58.734
50?

17:58.734 --> 17:59.900
A HUNDRED PERCENT.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.934
BUT THAT'S AS HIGH AS I'LL GO.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.100
AH. CODY, I BELIEVE I HAVE
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION

18:08.100 --> 18:10.133
THAT WILL MAKE
BOTH OF US HAPPY.

18:10.133 --> 18:11.967
I HAVE ARRANGED
WITH THE ZOO

18:11.967 --> 18:13.967
TO TAKE YOUNG BUBBA
OFF YOUR HANDS.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.300
BUT I DON'T WANT
BUBBA OFF MY HANDS.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.100
BUBBA AND I ARE
DOING JUST FINE.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.500
I'M GONNA TEACH HIM
HOW TO FLY.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.233
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THAT TEST FLIGHT.

18:24.233 --> 18:28.000
AND THEN I'M GOING
TO RELEASE HIM
INTO THE WILD.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.834
HAWKS LIVE LONGER
IN CAPTIVITY.

18:30.834 --> 18:31.600
THEY DO?

18:31.600 --> 18:34.133
OH, YES.
BY SEVERAL YEARS.

18:34.133 --> 18:35.667
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.967
AND YOU CAN
VISIT HIM EVERY DAY.

18:37.967 --> 18:39.567
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

18:39.567 --> 18:43.100
BUT I THINK BUBBA WOULD
BE HAPPIER IN THE WILD.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.800
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

18:44.800 --> 18:47.500
I HAVE TO FEED BUBBA
HIS FILET MIGNON,

18:47.500 --> 18:50.367
CHARRED ON TOP
AND PINK IN THE MIDDLE.

18:50.367 --> 18:54.500
YES. JUST THE WAY
THEY PREPARE IT IN THE WILD.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.800
Carey: WOW.
BUBBA'S REALLY GROWN.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.033
WELL, HE'S BIG FOR HIS AGE.

19:08.033 --> 19:09.967
HAS HE BEEN FLAPPING
HIS WINGS MUCH?

19:09.967 --> 19:11.867
MORE AND MORE EACH DAY.

19:11.867 --> 19:13.867
IT WON'T BE LONG
UNTIL I TAKE HIM TO THE ZOO.

19:13.867 --> 19:15.000
ZOO?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.834
WELL, YOU KNOW, HAWKS
LIVE LONGER IN CAPTIVITY.

19:17.834 --> 19:18.934
THERE ARE NO HUNTERS,

19:18.934 --> 19:21.100
AND HE'LL GET
3 SQUARE MICE A DAY.

19:21.100 --> 19:25.200
YEAH, BUT HE'LL GET 'EM
THROUGH A METAL SLOT
IN A DOOR, HON.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.700
BUT I'LL GET TO VISIT BUBBA
WHENEVER I WANT.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.700
WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?

19:30.700 --> 19:33.800
I GUESS. WHAT HAPPENED
TO LETTING HIM GO?

19:33.800 --> 19:36.100
YOU DON'T THINK BUBBA
HAS WHAT IT TAKES
TO MAKE IT OUT THERE?

19:36.100 --> 19:40.200
SHH. HE'LL HEAR YOU.
HE'S GOT EARS LIKE A HAWK.

19:43.967 --> 19:46.500
DID I EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT THE DAY I LEFT HOME?

19:46.500 --> 19:50.000
OH, NO. THIS ISN'T ONE
OF THOSE BOYFRIEND
STORIES AGAIN, IS IT?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.033
NO. NOT THIS TIME.

19:52.033 --> 19:54.500
I WAS 18 AND I WAS
GONNA LEAVE HOME.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.467
HOW COME?

19:55.467 --> 19:58.233
WELL, I JOINED
A ROCK BAND THAT MY...

19:58.233 --> 20:00.200
BOYFRIEND STARTED.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.767
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.900
I ASKED MY MOM IF SHE
WAS SAD THAT I WAS LEAVING,

20:04.900 --> 20:06.600
AND SHE SAID SHE WAS, BUT--

20:06.600 --> 20:07.834
BUT WHAT?

20:07.834 --> 20:10.000
BUT SHE ALSO SAID
THAT MY LEAVING HOME

20:10.000 --> 20:12.867
MEANT THAT
SHE'D DONE THE WORK
THAT SHE WAS MEANT TO DO.

20:12.867 --> 20:15.000
SHE RAISED ME
SO I COULD STAND ON MY OWN.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.200
I SEE.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.600
CODY, YOU'VE DONE
A TERRIFIC JOB.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.133
BUBBA'S GETTING READY
TO STAND ON HIS OWN.

20:21.133 --> 20:23.200
IT WOULD BE NICE
TO GO VISIT HIM IN A ZOO,

20:23.200 --> 20:26.233
BUT IT'S ALSO NICE
TO LET HIM HAVE HIS FREEDOM.

20:26.233 --> 20:27.867
WHAT IF HE
DOESN'T MAKE IT?

20:27.867 --> 20:30.200
THAT'S A CHANCE
MY MOTHER TOOK WITH ME.

20:30.200 --> 20:34.000
IT'S A CHANCE I'M GONNA TAKE
WITH YOU AND ZACK SOMEDAY.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.100
SO IT'S ALSO A CHANCE YOU CAN
TAKE WITH BUBBA IF YOU WANT.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.867
AND ALL ALONG,

20:39.867 --> 20:42.867
I'VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE
A HAWK'S A WILD THING

20:42.867 --> 20:45.233
AND YOU HAVE TO BE
WILLING TO LET IT GO.

20:45.233 --> 20:48.100
BOY, I AM SO BOGUS.

20:49.133 --> 20:51.033
YOU'RE NOT BOGUS.

20:51.033 --> 20:53.500
YOU'RE JUST A WORRIED MOTHER.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.967
THANKS.

20:54.967 --> 20:56.500
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:56.500 --> 20:58.767
MAYBE NEXT YEAR BUBBA WILL
COME BACK AND BUILD HIS NEST.

20:58.767 --> 21:00.400
IF HE FINDS
A GIRLFRIEND, THAT IS.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.834
OH, HE'LL FIND ONE.

21:01.834 --> 21:05.033
HE'S VERY GOOD-LOOKING,
AND HE HAS A GREAT
PERSONALITY.

21:06.567 --> 21:09.300
[CAWING]

21:11.033 --> 21:13.000
UH-OH. THE WIND
IS PICKING UP.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.467
BUBBA SEEMS
TO LIKE THAT.

21:15.467 --> 21:18.200
GO AHEAD, BUBBA. IT'S OK.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.233
YOU WERE MEANT TO FLY.
YOU'LL LIKE IT.

21:20.233 --> 21:21.767
COME BACK AND VISIT GRANDMA.

21:21.767 --> 21:23.200
[SHRIEKING]

21:23.200 --> 21:25.100
OH.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.500
LOOK AT HIM GO.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.600
HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.667
MOM, WHEN YOU LEFT,
DID YOUR MOTHER CRY?

21:35.700 --> 21:38.200
ONLY AFTER I WAS GONE.

21:45.834 --> 21:48.834
THE TIPTON HATES HAWKS!
THE TIPTON--

21:48.834 --> 21:50.934
MADELINE, PLEASE.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.867
LOOK, A ZOO ISN'T SO BAD.

21:52.867 --> 21:54.967
THEN WHY AREN'T
YOU LIVING IN ONE?

21:54.967 --> 21:56.867
I AM.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.367
THIS ISSUE IS SETTLED.

21:59.367 --> 22:03.200
THAT BIRD IS CHECKING OUT
OF THE TIPTON AND INTO THE ZOO.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.700
[SHRIEKING]

22:04.700 --> 22:06.834
NO, HE'S NOT.

22:06.834 --> 22:08.667
BUT CODY PROMISED.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.300
ISN'T HE BEAUTIFUL?

22:10.300 --> 22:11.800
[SHRIEKING]

22:11.800 --> 22:13.700
I HAVE TO ADMIT.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.734
HE IS RATHER MAGNIFICENT.

22:15.734 --> 22:18.667
AND THAT'S WHY THEY SHOULD
BE ALLOWED TO FLY FREE.

22:18.667 --> 22:19.700
[SPLAT]

22:19.700 --> 22:23.734
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M RUNNING OUT OF SUITS.
