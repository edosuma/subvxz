<i>Kira!</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:15.580
Where have you been?

00:15.582 --> 00:17.649
I had to run some errands
during lunch.

00:17.651 --> 00:21.186
- My vacation is in 3 days, remember?
- Right! Scottsdale! Exciting!

00:21.188 --> 00:24.322
But I need you to help me QA the
interactive shark-diving feature

00:24.324 --> 00:25.891
for the new travel site.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.827
Vicky, I cannot believe you got
in the water with sharks!

00:28.829 --> 00:31.163
It's not like I was petting them
or anything.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.631
There was a cage.

00:32.633 --> 00:36.334
There is not a cage big enough that
can make me even consider doing that.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.904
You sit safely in your chair
and experience it online!

00:38.906 --> 00:40.205
Help me, please.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.340
Don't you have a bazillion
Twitter followers?

00:42.342 --> 00:44.376
Can't you get them
to beta-test it for you?

00:44.378 --> 00:48.246
I did, but it involves them having to read
more than 280 characters at a time, so...

00:48.248 --> 00:50.382
How do you have
so many followers, anyway?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.551
I do things like get
in the water with sharks.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.921
Listen, I'm sorry. I just can't.
I have to finish my own websites.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.456
The more work I get done here,

00:57.458 --> 00:59.124
the less I have to do on vacation.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.893
You're going to Scottsdale.
What else are you gonna do?

01:01.895 --> 01:04.062
I'm gonna golf,
and I'm gonna go the spa,

01:04.063 --> 01:05.063
and I'm gonna hike!

01:05.065 --> 01:09.568
- You don't hike.
- I might, if the trails are clearly marked.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.670
Kira, shark diving
isn't for everyone.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.306
It's OK to like things
to be safe and dependable.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.375
- You mean boring and bland.
- I didn't say that!

01:17.377 --> 01:19.578
Look, it's your boyfriend, Brad,

01:19.580 --> 01:21.046
from accounting.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.014
- Whoa!
- Sorry!

01:26.687 --> 01:28.086
It's like a jungle in here.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.455
I can't understand
how you get anything done.

01:30.457 --> 01:33.191
- It's fun and creative!
- It's loud.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.994
It's nice and quiet up in accounting.
I'm just saying.

01:35.996 --> 01:39.898
I think it's better for the company If I
stay as far away from the books as possible.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.733
- You're good with numbers.
- Me?

01:41.735 --> 01:44.169
Chequing account,
savings account, a 401K.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.604
That's as complex
as I can get,

01:45.606 --> 01:47.472
which is why I'm dating
an accountant.

01:48.442 --> 01:52.043
- You got your errands done or...
- I did! Three days until vacation.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.778
You know what? I could use a coffee.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.747
Yeah.
I wish I could come with you.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.816
Just don't get so enamoured
with Scottsdale

01:57.818 --> 01:59.084
that you don't come home.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.186
There's gonna be
a wonderful birthday surprise

02:01.188 --> 02:02.354
waiting for you.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.556
- I brought your mail.
- Thanks.

02:04.558 --> 02:09.227
- Wow! This one's from South Africa!
- Yeah, it's Ukuthula,

02:09.229 --> 02:11.530
the wildlife reserve
my Great-Uncle Irving owns.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.964
I went there as a kid.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.200
That's where I fell in love
with elephants.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.738
- Oh no...
- What?

02:19.740 --> 02:23.842
- Uncle Irv passed away.
- I'm sorry.

02:23.844 --> 02:27.279
He was always so nice to me as a kid.
I haven't seen him in years.

02:27.281 --> 02:30.048
I think the last time I heard from him
was when my dad passed.

02:30.050 --> 02:33.118
But it says they've been trying
to find me for a couple months.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.853
Why?

02:34.855 --> 02:37.355
Apparently he left a portion
of his estate to me.

02:37.357 --> 02:40.525
But I have to be present at the
reading of the will to claim it.

02:40.527 --> 02:43.428
Well, that's crazy.
You can't go to South Africa.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.264
Well, of course I can't go
to South Africa.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074

03:14.428 --> 03:18.730
Oh, look, Tom's back.
Where were you?

03:18.732 --> 03:21.266
I just replaced
a dozen fence posts.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.369
Well, that's a dozen less
that needs replacing.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.171
We shall deem that as progress.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.640
Lwazi, we're playing
a dangerous game here.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.742
The entire fence
needs to be replaced.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.812
Well, not the entire fence,
if you just did 12 posts.

03:33.814 --> 03:37.349
- Ally, you're not helping.
- I wasn't trying to.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.818
Don't you have some guests
to take on a safari tour?

03:39.820 --> 03:41.152
Not for another hour.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.455
Besides, if I want them
to see animals in the wild,

03:43.457 --> 03:46.424
I could just bring them up here
and let them watch the two of you!

03:46.426 --> 03:48.593
Yeah! Cute!

03:48.595 --> 03:51.663
We're not done talking
about this.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.264
Did you call the lawyers again?

03:53.266 --> 03:55.266
- Yes, I did.
- And what did they say?

03:55.268 --> 03:58.470
That until they settle the details
of Irving's estate,

03:58.472 --> 03:59.938
we must tighten our belts.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.873
They've been saying that
for months.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.975
Our belts are so tight,
we can't even breathe.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.844
Perhaps we are eating too much.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.948
If only the lawyers would listen to me,
then I could fix this.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.182
- Here we go.
- What?

04:11.184 --> 04:12.717
You're doing that thing again

04:12.719 --> 04:15.520
where you think that you can fix
everything by yourself.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.721
I just fixed
a dozen fence posts by myself.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.858
And we appreciate your
passion for Ukuthula.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.561
Don't act like you don't get
passionate about this place too.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.063
No, it's just more subtle.

04:25.065 --> 04:28.033
Your eyebrow arches up really high,
and it does that thi...

04:28.035 --> 04:29.401
What, you're not coming?

04:29.403 --> 04:32.437
Oh no! No, you like doing things
by yourself.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.241
You are not gonna win
this round.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.378
All right,
are you just humouring me

04:40.380 --> 04:42.647
because of the job offer
in the States?

04:42.649 --> 04:45.016
Lwazi, I told you
I'm not taking it.

04:45.018 --> 04:49.387
But if you do, you will leave
with our hearty felicitations

04:49.389 --> 04:51.990
and best wishes
for continued success.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.459
Yes, and thank you
for that, but...

04:54.461 --> 04:56.394
What is Artie Warrington
doing here?

04:56.396 --> 04:59.330
- On a tour.
- A tour? Wh-why?

04:59.332 --> 05:01.332
Oh, well,
the lawyers arranged it.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.268
Lwazi, his family
owns tacky resorts.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.736
These are tourist traps

05:04.738 --> 05:07.272
that are about as far away
from authentic as one can get.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.808
The lawyers aren't thinking
of selling to him, are they?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.543
Well, it's not up to us.

05:27.394 --> 05:28.927
Good night.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.248
I can't believe
you're going to Africa.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.183
To be honest with you,
neither can I.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.419
You don't even know
what your uncle left you!

05:54.421 --> 05:56.988
His attorney said that
it was something significant,

05:56.990 --> 05:59.758
but he couldn't say more until
after the reading of the will.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.859
- Huh!
- Hi!

06:00.861 --> 06:02.026
Thank you.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.962
Significant?
What does that mean?

06:03.964 --> 06:05.130
I don't know.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.198
You know, the only thing
I could think of,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.634
he had this collection
of antique safari whistles

06:09.636 --> 06:10.902
that I used to play with.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.203
Maybe it's that.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.472
You're going all the way
to Africa for whistles.

06:14.474 --> 06:18.310
- What, is that crazy? Am I crazy?
- Definitely.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.514
God, I just feel like I...
feel like I have to do this.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.615
OK!

06:23.617 --> 06:25.717
I owe it to Uncle Irv
to be there.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.588
- Stay safe.
- Oh, you know me, Brad.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.591
I keep my feet firmly
planted on the ground.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.816
<i>So, who are we picking up again?</i>

06:57.818 --> 06:59.851
It's Irving's great niece
from Chicago.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.020
She's coming in for the
reading of the will.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.122
All Lwazi really said was
that she's a VIP

07:04.124 --> 07:05.190
and we should be nice.

07:05.192 --> 07:08.293
- Oh, and she still sent you?
- I am a joy to be around always.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.527
Wait.

07:09.529 --> 07:12.063
You don't think she's
the new owner, do you?

07:12.065 --> 07:13.431
What? No.

07:13.433 --> 07:17.335
- Who else? I didn't think he had any family.
- Well, that's my point.

07:17.337 --> 07:20.705
I mean, Irv's never mentioned her,
and she's never even visited.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.641
True, but if she's coming in
for the reading of the will...

07:27.814 --> 07:29.747
Irving would never leave
this place

07:29.749 --> 07:32.150
to somebody who didn't
love it as much as he did.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.518
Somebody who belonged here.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.789
What makes you think
she doesn't belong here?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.628
Just a hunch.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.337
- Hi!
- Hi there!

07:52.339 --> 07:53.338
You must be Kira.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.073
Hi!

07:55.075 --> 07:58.943
- I'm Tom Anderson, head ranger for Ukuthula.
- Ally Botsford, also a ranger.

07:58.945 --> 08:03.147
- It is so nice to meet you! It's hot here!
- Yeah. How was your flight in?

08:03.149 --> 08:06.751
I have never been so happy to be on
the ground in my whole entire life.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.854
- Not a big fan of small planes?
- Are my fingernail marks

08:09.856 --> 08:12.523
in the back of the pilot's arm
a giveaway?

08:12.525 --> 08:14.225
Is there no other way
to get here?

08:14.227 --> 08:17.695
We used to offer elephant rides from
Jo-Burg, but it wasn't cost-effective.

08:17.697 --> 08:18.663
Oh, really?

08:18.665 --> 08:19.931
No!

08:19.933 --> 08:22.367
We'd never exploit the
animals in such a way...

08:22.369 --> 08:24.636
He was joking.
He's just not very funny.

08:25.605 --> 08:28.273
- Why don't we get you to the lodge?
- Great.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.274
That'd be great.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.541
You know, I would just love

08:30.543 --> 08:31.976
to stop and freshen up first.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.244
Where... where is the airport?

08:33.246 --> 08:35.078
Yeah, we had to get rid
of that, too,

08:35.081 --> 08:36.681
when we nixed
the elephant rides.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.583
Kira, why don't you just get
in that truck right over there

08:39.586 --> 08:41.085
and we'll grab
your luggage, OK?

08:41.087 --> 08:42.986
- OK.
- OK.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.923
Told you she didn't belong here.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.692
- I thought you were gonna be nice!
- It was me being nice.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.595
You think Irv's gonna leave
the reserve to someone like this?

09:20.860 --> 09:23.461
- Thank you!
- Reception's just up the path.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.796
OK!

09:27.767 --> 09:29.400
Wow!

09:30.370 --> 09:32.337
Kira! Welcome!

09:33.306 --> 09:35.340
- I'm Lwazi.
- Hi!

09:35.342 --> 09:37.809
Look at you! You are grown
into a beautiful woman.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.744
And you probably
don't even remember me.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.479
Of course I remember you!

09:41.481 --> 09:44.115
You used to sneak me extra cookies
in the dining room.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.450
Shhh!
Don't tell these two.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.618
They'll want me to sneak
them extra cookies!

09:48.655 --> 09:49.954
You must be thirsty.

09:49.956 --> 09:52.390
Everyone, please come in.
We have fresh iced tea.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.926
I can't. I have my last group
of the day to guide.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.995
And by group,
I mean Mr. and Mrs. Bagwell.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.597
- Thank you so much for the lift.
- Of course! My pleasure.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.366
I'll see you back
at the rangers office?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.700
- Yes, ma'am.
- OK.

10:02.702 --> 10:05.370
- Here, I'll take those.
- No, no! It's OK. I got it.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.571
Why don't you go inside?

10:06.573 --> 10:08.506
Wouldn't want you
to get overheated.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.874
I'll be fine.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.976
Really, I can take
my own luggage.

10:11.978 --> 10:12.944
I'm sure you can.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.546
But we check for spiders
before we bring the bags in.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.916
- Spiders?
- Yeah, big ones!

10:20.220 --> 10:23.021
They're all over the path, too, so...

10:38.671 --> 10:40.371
He was a good man.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.341
Yeah, I have
very, very fond memories.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.344
I just wish I had gotten
to know him better.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.079
Did you know him well?

10:48.081 --> 10:50.681
Yeah!
Been here for almost 10 years.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.050
He was quite the character.

10:53.753 --> 10:55.386
He loved this place.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.687
I remember.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.659
- So, who owns it now?
- We don't know.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.695
We've been dealing with
lawyers ever since he passed.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.497
They're still trying
to sort it out.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.300
Must make managing things
here a little challenging.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.869
It does. But the end
result is always worth it.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.605
Thank you.
Even with the spiders?

11:14.607 --> 11:16.007
Even with the spiders.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.643
Well, why don't we get you
settled in your room?

11:18.645 --> 11:20.545
Tonight we'll have dinner
in the boma,

11:20.547 --> 11:22.947
then tomorrow morning, we'll
meet with the lawyer.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.449
That sounds great. Thank you.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.285
- Jason will show you to your room.
- Great!

11:27.287 --> 11:30.021
- See you later.
- Bye!

11:43.436 --> 11:44.936
Wow!

11:48.174 --> 11:50.741
- Thank you so much.
- It's a pleasure.

12:12.699 --> 12:16.200
OK. There's a giraffe
in my room.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.677
Hey, Kira!

12:26.679 --> 12:29.080
So? Did you get out to
explore the grounds much?

12:29.082 --> 12:33.184
Not really, but the grounds
kind of came in to explore me.

12:33.186 --> 12:36.554
- OK. How do you mean?
- There was a giraffe.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.223
Right. No, no, no.
They do that.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.225
But rest assured,
they're very friendly.

12:41.227 --> 12:45.496
I'm sure they are, but I just really
didn't expect one to be in my room.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.431
- Beautiful, though, huh?
- So beautiful.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.067
It's magical to see them
roaming free on the Savanna.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.036
Tell you what,
I'll take you out tomorrow,

12:52.038 --> 12:53.404
get you to experience more.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.406
I'd love that.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.108
You know, I wanted to ask you...

12:57.110 --> 12:59.577
It seems very quiet, like
there aren't a lot of guests.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.012
Is that normal
this time of year?

13:01.014 --> 13:03.181
Well, admittedly,
we're lighter than usual.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.716
You see, we rely on European
tourists for the most part,

13:05.718 --> 13:07.318
and the euro's
really low right now,

13:07.320 --> 13:09.654
so it's a lot harder for them
to travel.

13:09.656 --> 13:13.658
Kira, please feel free to ignore
everything this man says.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.293
I usually do.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.295
- Hey!
- Good to know!

13:18.631 --> 13:21.499
Wonderful! Everyone is here!

13:21.501 --> 13:23.301
Kira, you haven't met S'bu.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.037
He manages the food and beverage
program here at Ukuthula.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.172
So I guess I better stay
on your good side

13:28.174 --> 13:29.540
if I wanna eat, right?

13:29.542 --> 13:32.210
Tom has not been
on my good side for years,

13:32.212 --> 13:33.811
but I still feed him.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.147
OK, it's like that?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.848
What is it, "pick on Tom" night?

13:37.850 --> 13:39.917
It's always "pick on Tom" night.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.385
It's better than charades.

13:41.387 --> 13:42.920
For you.

13:42.922 --> 13:47.058
Everyone, I'm reminded
of an old African proverb.

13:48.194 --> 13:51.262
You should return
to old watering holes

13:51.264 --> 13:53.097
for more than water.

13:53.099 --> 13:56.100
Friends and dreams
are there to meet you.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.037
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

14:03.576 --> 14:05.109
Everything was so good.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.612
I don't think I'll be
hungry again for a week.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.615
Wait till you see the Savanna
breakfast tomorrow morning.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.550
I guarantee it'll spark
your appetite.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.719
Hopefully Uncle Irv
left me a wheelbarrow

14:14.721 --> 14:17.154
so you guys will have
something to haul me off in

14:17.156 --> 14:18.322
after I gain 100 pounds.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.957
That's why it's called
a vacation.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.892
- Good night, Kira.
- Good night.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.194
Good night!

14:24.297 --> 14:26.230
That was such a good dinner.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.599
I guess we did well.
That's just my opinion.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.722
Thank you.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.090
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

14:53.092 --> 14:56.360
Oh wow! This is just...

14:58.331 --> 15:00.264
...really just incredible.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.768
Do you... do you do this
for all of your guests?

15:03.770 --> 15:06.470
This is what Irving wanted
for the reading of his will.

15:06.472 --> 15:09.006
Kira, this is Glen Wood,
one of Ukuthula's lawyers.

15:09.008 --> 15:11.242
Ms. Slater, I believe
we spoke on the phone.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.645
- Yeah, it's so nice to meet you.
- Yes, and you know Tom and Ally.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.247
- Absolutely. Hi.
- Hi.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.381
Hi. Hi.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.917
- OK, well, should we start?
- Certainly, please!

15:19.919 --> 15:20.885
- Great!
- Yeah!

15:20.887 --> 15:24.322
- Where should I sit?
- Ms. Slater, would take the head of the table?

15:24.324 --> 15:26.257
- Really?
- Yeah!

15:26.259 --> 15:28.259
OK! Thank you.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.529
OK!

15:31.531 --> 15:34.065
Well, we have a number
of items to get through...

15:35.068 --> 15:36.267
...some personal treasures

15:36.269 --> 15:38.035
that Irving has left
to specific people,

15:38.037 --> 15:41.038
like his coin collection and
his antique safari whistles.

15:42.008 --> 15:46.811
But I think, first of all, I must talk
about the proverbial elephant in the room.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.780
He wanted Ukuthula
to be cared for

15:49.782 --> 15:52.116
the way he did
throughout his life.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.720
And he felt that the only way
that this could truly happen

15:55.722 --> 15:57.822
was for it to stay
in the family.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.758
So he's granted full
ownership of the reserve

16:00.760 --> 16:03.461
to his nearest living relative,

16:03.463 --> 16:04.895
Kira Slater.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.569
I'm sorry, what?

16:11.571 --> 16:13.504
A toast.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.339
- Yes!
- To Kira.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.541
- Kira.
- To Kira.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.615
I really should've gone
to Scottsdale.

16:36.262 --> 16:39.930
So, he left me this?
All this?

16:39.932 --> 16:42.366
I know this is a surprise.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.901
What? No, no, no.

16:43.903 --> 16:46.404
A surprise is like balloons
and people with noisemakers.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.940
A surprise is not a wildlife
reserve in Africa!

16:49.942 --> 16:52.510
I mean, are you sure he
didn't leave anything else,

16:52.512 --> 16:55.279
you know, like, I don't know,
maybe just the Serengeti

16:55.281 --> 16:56.947
or, you know, The Sphinx, maybe?

16:56.949 --> 16:58.449
'Cause, really, I came here,

16:58.451 --> 17:00.117
I thought
I was expecting whistles.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.286
You came all the way to Africa
for whistles?

17:02.288 --> 17:04.221
Actually, the whistles
were left to Tom.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.057
Ms. Slater, we anticipated
that this might be,

17:07.059 --> 17:09.527
shall I say,
not in your area of expertise.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.095
Yeah, it's...
it's way out.

17:11.097 --> 17:14.464
Yeah, well, we understand that
this is a big responsibility.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.500
But should you wish to sell, then...

17:16.502 --> 17:18.769
- What is... what is this?
- It's an offer to buy it.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.606
- Wait, to buy it?
- Who is this offer from?

17:22.608 --> 17:25.009
It's from a very reputable,
family-owned company.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.810
It's not Artie Warrington, is it?

17:26.813 --> 17:28.813
- Wait, who?
- Who... who's that?

17:28.815 --> 17:31.649
Warrington group
is a successful resort company.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.984
They cater to the lowest
common denominator.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.420
Right. All of their properties
are the same.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.156
They have no personality.
I mean, Ukuthula's special.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.326
Perhaps we should all sit
and enjoy our breakfast

17:42.328 --> 17:44.261
and talk about this calmly.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.063
I'm sure it will be fine.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.833
Not if Ukuthula's sold
to Artie Warrington.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.434
Kira, you don't have to do this.

17:50.436 --> 17:53.771
I mean, surely there's somebody else
who's willing to buy Ukuthula.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.006
All right, I'll find
somebody else to buy.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.476
I'm afraid there's not.
This is the only offer.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.579
Well, then,
she'll just have to keep it!

18:01.581 --> 18:03.814
- Keep it?
- Yeah.

18:03.816 --> 18:04.816
Keep it? I...

18:06.252 --> 18:08.686
Keep it? That's really funny,
'cause you know what?

18:08.688 --> 18:11.789
I actually rent my apartment,
and I lease my car.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.757
I don't own anything. I can't...

18:13.759 --> 18:15.759
I can't own an African reserve.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.063
Would you like me
to initiate the sale?

18:36.315 --> 18:39.183
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

18:44.056 --> 18:47.558
I can't believe they're gonna
sell Ukuthula to Warrington.

18:47.560 --> 18:52.563
- I'm surprised it matters to you.
- Ally! It's me! I love this place.

18:52.565 --> 18:56.066
OK, well, then why are you still
considering that job in the States?

18:56.068 --> 18:58.369
- I'm not.
- You haven't told them no.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.404
Well, they gave me
a few weeks to decide.

19:00.406 --> 19:03.207
I figured with all the upheaval
around here, it would...

19:03.209 --> 19:05.509
You thought it would
be good to have options.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.144
Yeah, which we seem
to be out of.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.746
We need to find somebody fast

19:08.748 --> 19:11.348
who appreciates Ukuthula
for what it already is.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.084
I agree, but I'm not the one
who needs convincing.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.154
The lawyers will listen to me.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.723
The lawyers don't own Ukuthula, Tom.
Kira does.

19:19.725 --> 19:23.394
Well, then we need to find a way
to convince her not to sell.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.895
I think I can do that.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.598
Unless you decide that job in
the States is a better idea.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.533
Whether I stay or not,

19:29.535 --> 19:32.136
I'm not gonna let Ukuthula
go to Warrington.

19:32.138 --> 19:35.873
OK. Then the question is how
do you make Kira want that too?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.578
I make her fall in love.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.047
Yeah, with the reserve.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.815
Call it a charm offensive, huh?

19:46.052 --> 19:49.119
Wouldn't that require you
to be charming?

19:56.929 --> 19:58.562
<i>He left you everything?</i>

19:58.564 --> 20:00.898
Yes! I mean, this... this
whole thing is just crazy!

20:00.900 --> 20:04.435
<i>Look, the good news is that
the lawyers have lined up a buyer,</i>

20:04.437 --> 20:06.670
<i>so all you have to do
is hand over the keys.</i>

20:06.672 --> 20:08.572
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I guess so.

20:08.574 --> 20:10.140
<i>What do you mean,
you guess so?</i>

20:10.142 --> 20:11.875
Well, it's just
one of the guys here

20:11.877 --> 20:14.612
didn't exactly have the nicest
things to say about the buyer.

20:14.614 --> 20:15.946
<i>That's not your problem.</i>

20:15.948 --> 20:18.282
No, I know, but I still
don't want anything bad

20:18.284 --> 20:19.249
to happen to it.

20:19.251 --> 20:20.784
I mean, it's...
it's beautiful here!

20:20.786 --> 20:22.820
<i>Did you at least
look at the offer?</i>

20:22.822 --> 20:25.789
I did. They actually want me
to meet with the buyer tomorrow.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.992
I'm sorry. I'm just in a
little shock right now.

20:27.994 --> 20:31.662
<i>Scan it and email it to me. I'll
let you know if it makes any sense.</i>

20:31.664 --> 20:32.896
OK, thank you, Brad.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.565
<i>The sooner
you get rid of this,</i>

20:34.567 --> 20:37.835
<i>the sooner you can come home
to your fantastic surprise.</i>

20:37.837 --> 20:40.337
What, did you buy me
the Lincoln Park Zoo?

20:40.339 --> 20:42.906
<i>Rats! How did you guess?</i>

20:44.076 --> 20:46.477
- Bye!
- Bye.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.148
Yet another thing you think
you can fix by yourself.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.450
Why don't you call a mechanic?

20:53.452 --> 20:56.320
'Cause I don't need a
mechanic, thank you very...

20:57.590 --> 20:58.889
What are you...

21:01.193 --> 21:02.893
Try it now.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.663
OK.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.271
Oh, it works! I fixed it!

21:14.273 --> 21:17.241
- Oh, you fixed it?
- I did fix it.

21:17.243 --> 21:20.310
See, it wasn't working when I
came over here, and now it is.

21:20.312 --> 21:21.712
So cause and effect.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.281
That's not science.
That's not how it works.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.582
Hey, Kira! Good...

21:25.584 --> 21:27.017
It's still morning.
Good morning.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.286
So sorry I slept so late.
I just...

21:29.288 --> 21:30.688
Man, I'm so jetlagged!

21:30.690 --> 21:32.890
That's OK.
It happens to best of us.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.726
Right, Tom? Now's your
chance to be charming.

21:35.728 --> 21:40.197
- Yeah! Jetlag, it's the worst.
- Yeah.

21:40.199 --> 21:41.365
That was great.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.701
So, Kira, what's on the agenda
for today?

21:43.703 --> 21:47.304
Well, the lawyers want me to meet
with Artie Warrington this afternoon.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.740
I was just hoping there's
some way to get there

21:49.742 --> 21:51.175
that doesn't involve a plane.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.243
We can arrange
for transportation for you.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.212
It should take you
about an hour to get in.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.881
- OK, thanks!
- Yeah, no problem.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.450
Hey, are you hungry?

21:59.452 --> 22:01.652
To be honest with you,
I am famished!

22:01.654 --> 22:06.657
OK, perfect, because Tom actually has
a really nice lunch planned for you two.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.459
You do?

22:08.461 --> 22:09.927
- I do.
- Yeah!

22:09.929 --> 22:12.830
He was gonna run to the kitchen
and grab some supplies

22:12.832 --> 22:15.999
and take you to the most scenic
part of the reserve, Rock Lodge.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.869
Rock Lodge! Seriously,
you don't wanna miss it.

22:18.871 --> 22:22.005
- It is beautiful.
- That... that sounds great!

22:22.007 --> 22:23.741
OK, I'll just grab a hat.
Cool!

22:23.743 --> 22:25.209
See you back here in, like, 10?

22:25.211 --> 22:26.343
- Perfect.
- OK.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.478
Awesome!

22:27.480 --> 22:29.680
What was that?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.181
Hey!

22:33.419 --> 22:35.853
Just remember to be charming.

22:57.977 --> 22:58.942
Sorry about that.

22:58.944 --> 23:02.112
- The roads here are pretty bumpy.
- That's OK.

23:02.114 --> 23:05.415
You obviously haven't driven
on a Chicago street lately.

23:07.353 --> 23:08.585
No, I haven't.

23:28.474 --> 23:32.242
- Why are we stopping here?
- You'll see!

23:43.522 --> 23:47.558
- Welcome to Rock Lodge!
- Wow!

23:47.560 --> 23:50.561
This is just...

23:50.563 --> 23:52.262
Just wow!

23:53.933 --> 23:56.200
I'm sorry. I know I keep
saying that a lot, but...

23:56.202 --> 23:58.569
That's OK.
Pretty wow-worthy.

24:01.941 --> 24:06.343
So, listen, I wanted to talk to you
about selling the reserve.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.779
OK.

24:11.784 --> 24:16.119
I was wondering if, you
know, maybe you wouldn't!

24:16.121 --> 24:18.622
- Wouldn't sell it?
- Yeah.

24:18.624 --> 24:23.060
- And what would I do with it? Keep it?
- Why not?

24:23.062 --> 24:26.463
Because I... I'm a web designer

24:26.465 --> 24:29.099
with a... with a job and life
and a boyfriend in Chicago.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.534
I can't run Ukuthula.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.969
Right, but you don't have to.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.937
Lwazi and I can take
care of the day-to-day.

24:33.939 --> 24:35.839
Yeah, but there's
everything else!

24:35.841 --> 24:37.975
I mean, it needs
a new marketing campaign,

24:37.977 --> 24:39.676
the website needs
a total overhaul,

24:39.678 --> 24:41.678
there's everything that needs
to be fixed

24:41.680 --> 24:42.913
you've been talking about,

24:42.915 --> 24:44.715
and I don't have the money
for that.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.216
Unless you want me to start up

24:46.218 --> 24:48.385
the elephant rides
from the airport again.

24:48.387 --> 24:51.388
- I know it would be a risk.
- No, it would be insanity!

24:52.625 --> 24:54.591
My uncle was the risk-taker,
not me.

24:54.593 --> 24:57.928
Everybody needs a little bit
of adventure in their lives.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.197
No, everyone needs
a little stability.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.332
I don't need to be worried
about whether or not

25:02.334 --> 25:04.668
I have enough money for,
you know, giraffe chow.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.004
Giraffes eat leaves!
Plenty of leaves!

25:07.006 --> 25:09.373
See, I didn't know!
I don't know what giraffes eat!

25:09.375 --> 25:11.808
But if you put a bit of
time in, I'll teach you.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.077
I know Ukuthula's important
to you.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.313
And this is...

25:16.315 --> 25:18.415
I mean, this is
my uncle's life's work,

25:18.417 --> 25:20.384
so it makes it
incredibly hard, but...

25:21.654 --> 25:23.787
Keeping it
is just not a realistic option.

25:26.759 --> 25:30.394
I think we should probably
just go back to the lodge.

25:50.849 --> 25:54.851
- I didn't mean to...
- It's OK. Let's just go back.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.363
OK, you've gotta be kidding me.

26:06.365 --> 26:10.801
I'll just radio back to base
and have someone come get us.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.169
Tom to base. Come in, base.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.074
Tom to base. Come in, base.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.210
Mountains around here sometimes
interfere with the signal.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.312
Tom to base. Come in, base.

26:23.716 --> 26:26.350
And I'm... I'm assuming that
walking back isn't an option

26:26.352 --> 26:27.818
because of the hungry animals?

26:27.820 --> 26:30.187
There's no need to panic.
We'll follow procedures.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.388
It's only a matter of time

26:31.390 --> 26:32.956
before they realize
we're missing

26:32.958 --> 26:34.891
and send someone
to come and get us.

26:34.893 --> 26:37.995
OK. And how...
how long will that be?

26:37.997 --> 26:40.731
A few hours, hopefully.

26:40.733 --> 26:43.633
All right! OK, just a few hours.

26:44.870 --> 26:48.071
So, what should we do
in the meantime?

26:49.441 --> 26:51.842
Wanna play a game of I Spy?

26:53.412 --> 26:55.846
Maybe we should
just go back up there.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.782
Yeah, I'm gonna go back up.

27:11.530 --> 27:15.098
- You're a website designer?
- I'm not giving you a cookie.

27:15.100 --> 27:18.101
- I don't want a cookie.
- Yeah, you do.

27:18.103 --> 27:19.836
They are really delicious.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.938
I was just making conversation!

27:22.908 --> 27:26.176
- Yes, I'm a web designer.
- Well, that's interesting.

27:26.178 --> 27:29.346
Do you like your job,
designing all these websites?

27:29.348 --> 27:32.516
I do, but I make marketing
websites for big corporations.

27:34.119 --> 27:36.053
And it's just not very exciting.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.687
I wanna find my own thing

27:37.689 --> 27:40.991
and just find that thing
that I'm passionate about.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.794
I think we're all trying
to find that.

27:43.796 --> 27:47.164
I'm pretty sure you found yours.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.633
Yeah.

27:49.635 --> 27:52.602
Maybe I get a little too
passionate sometimes.

27:53.872 --> 27:56.306
So, how did you end up here from...

27:56.308 --> 27:58.742
- Where you from again?
- Kansas.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.644
I grew up on a farm,
so it's logical.

28:00.646 --> 28:02.012
I've always loved animals.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.748
Not a lot of lions on a farm.

28:04.750 --> 28:08.118
No, but those cows, let me tell you,
can be pretty vicious.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.721
I studied zoology and got lucky.

28:11.723 --> 28:14.791
They recruited me to
come straight out here.

28:14.793 --> 28:16.860
So, now I get to take care
of real lions

28:16.862 --> 28:18.295
and elephants and giraffes.

28:18.297 --> 28:21.498
Oh, elephants!
Oh, the elephants.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.367
You know, I only came here a
couple times when I was a kid,

28:24.369 --> 28:26.002
but, man, the elephants just...

28:26.004 --> 28:27.571
There was this one, I...

28:27.573 --> 28:30.440
What was her name?
I think it was Kimba.

28:30.442 --> 28:34.211
Yeah. Circus rescue?
Yeah, she's still here.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.712
No way! Really?

28:35.714 --> 28:38.548
Yes! I can take you out
to see her if you like.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.853
- I... I...
- On... on one condition.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.856
- And what's that?
- It involves cookies.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.327
Thank you.

28:52.197 --> 28:53.697
I said have a cookie.

28:57.136 --> 29:00.203
<i>Miss Lwazi to Ally.</i>

29:01.173 --> 29:02.839
Hey, this is Ally!

29:02.841 --> 29:04.441
<i>Have you seen Tom?</i>

29:04.443 --> 29:07.010
No, not since he and Kira
went to lunch.

29:07.012 --> 29:09.679
- They're not back yet?
- I haven't seen them.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.882
OK, well, they were heading
to Rock Lodge.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.850
I know the reception
isn't great up there.

29:13.852 --> 29:17.487
<i>- Why was he taking her there?
- I don't know. It's scenic?</i>

29:17.489 --> 29:19.789
I am heading back
with the Harrises now.

29:19.791 --> 29:23.126
I'll drive up there and just
make sure everything's OK.

29:29.434 --> 29:35.872
Irving was a great man, truly.
He was full of life and energy.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.609
But understandably, as his
health started to fail,

29:39.611 --> 29:40.810
he simply couldn't make

29:40.812 --> 29:42.913
the necessary investments
in Ukuthula.

29:42.915 --> 29:46.082
So that alone has made my
job a lot more difficult.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.350
Sorry to hear that.

29:47.352 --> 29:49.419
You know, when I was a
kid, this place was...

29:49.421 --> 29:52.088
- How old were you?
- The first time?

29:52.090 --> 29:54.658
The first time,
I was maybe 5 or 6.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.061
The last time,
I was 14 or so.

29:58.063 --> 30:00.764
He just always made this place
seem so magical.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.065
Well, it is.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.602
How come you didn't come back
any sooner?

30:06.772 --> 30:10.073
My mom passed away, and my dad
and I moved around a lot.

30:10.075 --> 30:13.343
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

30:13.345 --> 30:16.246
Yeah, just after moving
from place to place so much,

30:16.248 --> 30:18.982
it kind of felt nice to
just stay still, you know?

30:18.984 --> 30:23.987
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- Yeah.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.256
Although,
if you had stayed still,

30:26.258 --> 30:29.359
you probably wouldn't be seeing
a sunset quite like this.

30:30.295 --> 30:31.995
I just...

30:33.465 --> 30:34.465
It's just... I just...

30:35.434 --> 30:37.534
You can say "wow".

30:37.536 --> 30:39.836
Thank you.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.640
- Wow!
- Yeah, wow!

30:46.211 --> 30:49.279
- So, you have a boyfriend in Chicago?
- I do!

30:49.281 --> 30:51.281
Yeah, I do. His name's Brad.

30:51.283 --> 30:52.415
He's... he's great.

30:52.417 --> 30:55.619
- Great, great.
- Yeah. And you...

30:55.621 --> 30:57.520
- Hello?
- You... Ally!

30:57.522 --> 31:00.457
Took you long enough to
figure out we were missing!

31:00.459 --> 31:01.424
- Missing?
- Yeah!

31:01.426 --> 31:04.961
You're so dramatic. You'd think
he got carried off by gorillas.

31:04.963 --> 31:06.596
I could've been.

31:06.598 --> 31:10.900
Actually, would you guys mind if we stayed
and watched the rest of the sunset?

31:10.902 --> 31:12.335
No.

31:56.581 --> 32:00.016
It's definitely not subtle.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.919
Yeah, Warrington doesn't exactly
do subtle.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.456
Listen, thank you for driving me
all the way into Johannesburg,

32:06.458 --> 32:08.858
especially since it's to meet
with the guy

32:08.860 --> 32:10.560
who wants to buy the reserve.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.697
Hey, today, I'm just your driver,
your no-pressure driver.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.465
Well, thank you.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.834
- Kira!
- Yeah?

32:17.836 --> 32:21.938
Just because the water's calm doesn't
mean there are no crocodiles.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.373
It's an African proverb.

32:24.343 --> 32:27.677
- Did you get that from Lwazi?
- No! It's an original!

32:28.780 --> 32:31.348
Lwazi makes hers up
to win arguments.

32:31.350 --> 32:34.150
- Just be careful.
- OK.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.956
Ms. Slater! Welcome to the
Warrington Johannesburg!

32:39.958 --> 32:42.325
- I'm Artie Warrington.
- Hi! It's Kira.

32:42.327 --> 32:45.962
- What can I get you to drink?
- You know, an iced tea would be great.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.832
Two iced teas. You enjoying
your visit to South Africa?

32:48.834 --> 32:51.267
Yes.

32:51.269 --> 32:53.169
It's... it's beautiful here.

32:53.171 --> 32:55.905
Thanks, we're very proud of it.
Please, join me.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.577
So, I wanna know more about you.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.713
What was it like finding out
Irving left Ukuthula to you?

33:03.715 --> 33:09.352
Shock and total disbelief and, you
know, just a little bit of panic.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.855
Yeah, I can imagine. Did
you know Irving well?

33:11.857 --> 33:12.922
Not really.

33:12.924 --> 33:17.093
It... it had actually been years since
I had seen him or spoken to him.

33:17.095 --> 33:20.663
Irving was a great man. Didn't
have much of a head for business.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.565
- Madam.
- Years ago, when my father...

33:22.567 --> 33:23.533
Thank you.

33:23.535 --> 33:24.834
...ran Warrington Resorts,

33:24.836 --> 33:26.069
he tried to step to help.

33:26.071 --> 33:27.871
I did as well,
but Irving was proud.

33:27.873 --> 33:30.140
- Help how?
- To buy the place.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.409
To invest the kind of capital
it needed to thrive.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.210
We have the resources to do that.

33:34.212 --> 33:36.713
So, I'm presuming
you've reviewed my offer.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.148
Yes, of course.

33:38.150 --> 33:41.451
I just wanna make sure that it's...
it's in Ukuthula's best interest,

33:41.453 --> 33:43.653
you know, that it's not
just another hotel.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.822
Kira, I know my family
has this reputation

33:45.824 --> 33:48.191
of putting the bottom line
above everything else,

33:48.193 --> 33:50.393
but I understand what
makes Ukuthula special,

33:50.395 --> 33:51.928
and I wanna keep it that way.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.396
That's great.

33:53.398 --> 33:54.931
I'm sure everything will be fine,

33:54.933 --> 33:57.333
but I do have to go over
the offer with the lawyers

33:57.335 --> 33:58.835
and everyone back at the reserve.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.403
Of course.
I totally understand.

34:00.405 --> 34:02.238
Take all the time you need.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.673
Great!

34:09.347 --> 34:13.283
- Hey!
- Hey!

34:13.284 --> 34:15.752
So? How'd it go?

34:15.754 --> 34:18.388
The waters were... very calm.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.458
Listen, I... I really
didn't mean to overstep if I did,

34:21.460 --> 34:23.326
or... or to try to colour
your opinion.

34:23.328 --> 34:24.994
Of course you did.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.031
It's OK, though.
I appreciate it.

34:28.033 --> 34:30.967
I just wish there was
something more I could do.

34:32.204 --> 34:35.170
Do you mind if we take a detour
on the way back to the reserve?

34:35.172 --> 34:37.907
Are you gonna strand us out in
the middle of nowhere again?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.442
'Cause I didn't bring any cookies.

34:45.382 --> 34:47.550
The village, it's...
it's so different now!

34:47.552 --> 34:50.920
This place is an important part
of Ukuthula too, you know.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.022
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.623
A lot of our staff lives here.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.193
We, do our best to try
to help support them,

34:57.195 --> 34:59.429
but it's tough now
for any of the villages

34:59.431 --> 35:01.297
that aren't partnered
with reserves.

35:01.299 --> 35:02.899
Partnered how?

35:02.901 --> 35:07.203
Well, it's common nowadays for a village
to actually own part of a reserve.

35:07.205 --> 35:10.006
They get invested in protecting
the land and the animals.

35:10.008 --> 35:12.742
It swells into a sense of
pride for the entire village.

35:12.744 --> 35:13.710
That's incredible!

35:13.712 --> 35:16.846
It also opens the door to government
assistance and tax breaks.

35:16.848 --> 35:17.914
Wow! Amazing.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.684
Where's that beautiful singing
coming from?

35:22.587 --> 35:26.589
- The school Uncle Irv built.
- Really?

35:26.591 --> 35:30.093
He knew those children were
the future for Ukuthula.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.846
<i>OK, so, I had some time
to look at the offer</i>

36:23.848 --> 36:25.281
<i>from a numbers perspective,</i>

36:25.283 --> 36:26.916
<i>and I think
it's pretty solid.</i>

36:26.918 --> 36:29.152
And that's what the lawyers
think too.

36:29.154 --> 36:31.287
<i>Did you have a chance
to go through it?</i>

36:31.289 --> 36:33.590
I read most of it.
I've just been so busy.

36:33.592 --> 36:36.426
We went to this Zulu village yesterday.
It was amazing.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.194
And we saw these
beautiful children

36:38.196 --> 36:39.729
from the school my uncle built.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.064
<i>That's nice.</i>

36:41.066 --> 36:43.199
<i>- Then there was the website.
- What website?</i>

36:43.201 --> 36:45.268
Ukuthula's website.
I'm redesigning it.

36:45.270 --> 36:48.271
<i>You said you weren't gonna
work while you were there.</i>

36:48.273 --> 36:50.106
Yeah, I know,
but inspiration struck,

36:50.108 --> 36:51.541
and I just had to go with it.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.276
<i>Ukuthula inspired you?</i>

36:53.278 --> 36:54.944
Brad, it is just incredible here.

36:54.946 --> 36:55.912
Kira!

36:55.914 --> 36:57.246
Sorry! Coming!

36:57.248 --> 36:59.515
I gotta go 'cause we're
about to go see elephants.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.017
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.485
<i>Bye.</i>

37:07.559 --> 37:10.693
They are just...

37:11.663 --> 37:14.030
- This is just...
- Back to "wow" again?

37:14.032 --> 37:16.299
Uh, no, "wow" doesn't even cover it.

37:16.301 --> 37:20.870
- Wait, which one is Kimba?
- Don't see her yet.

37:20.872 --> 37:25.541
See, sometimes she stays back
with the rest of the herd.

37:25.543 --> 37:28.378
- She's the matriarch now.
- Kimba's the matriarch?

37:28.380 --> 37:30.313
Yeah! You sound surprised.

37:30.315 --> 37:33.750
When I was here, she was still
being socialized into the herd.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.051
I actually fed her one time.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.019
- No way!
- Yeah!

37:36.021 --> 37:37.553
I was this tiny 10-year-old,

37:37.555 --> 37:39.789
and, I mean,
she blocked out the sun.

37:39.791 --> 37:43.393
And, yep, I marched right up to her,
and she was just so gentle.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.528
I wonder if she'd remember me.

37:45.530 --> 37:48.531
Well, you know, they say
an elephant never forgets.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.971
It's hard to believe
that only 100 years ago,

37:54.973 --> 37:57.340
there were 3 million
elephants roaming Africa.

37:57.342 --> 37:59.609
Now, there's fewer than
half a million left.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.544
Kimba's calf
could live to be 70

38:01.546 --> 38:03.913
because she was lucky enough
to be born

38:03.915 --> 38:05.448
at a place like Ukuthula.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.316
That's why this place
is so important,

38:07.318 --> 38:09.252
I mean, not just for Kimba
and her family,

38:09.254 --> 38:11.521
but for all of the animals.

38:11.523 --> 38:16.259
- I think everyone should see this.
- Yeah, hopefully everyone will.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.098
A little too passionate again, huh?

38:23.034 --> 38:24.767
No.

38:24.769 --> 38:25.935
Never.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.279
- Good afternoon, you two!
- Hi, Ally!

38:36.281 --> 38:38.347
I'm your ranger
for this afternoon's drive,

38:38.349 --> 38:40.550
so when you're finished
lunch, we can head out.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.652
We can't wait.
We are so excited!

38:42.654 --> 38:44.087
Aren't we, John?

38:44.089 --> 38:46.689
Yeah, we'd be more excited
if we get to see lions today.

38:46.691 --> 38:47.790
You might be in luck!

38:47.792 --> 38:50.760
I heard from one of the other
rangers, and they've spotted them.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.361
- Really?
- Big ones.

38:52.363 --> 38:55.098
- How big?
- With full manes and big teeth.

38:55.100 --> 38:58.234
- Don't get me started on the teeth.
- I'll get the camera.

38:59.404 --> 39:01.037
Guys always love lions!

39:01.039 --> 39:03.840
Big TVs, sports, lions.
That's all you need.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.274
You're right, I think.

39:06.244 --> 39:09.011
- Hey! How were the elephants?
- I wanna take one home!

39:09.013 --> 39:10.880
Well, that is generally
frowned upon.

39:10.882 --> 39:13.783
I figured. Plus they probably
wouldn't fit in my carry -on.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.151
No. I have an idea!

39:15.153 --> 39:17.620
Why don't you come out
with us on our game drive?

39:17.622 --> 39:19.756
- Yeah!
- I would love that!

39:19.758 --> 39:22.859
- But is that OK with Mrs. Bagwell?
- Please call me Evelyn.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.460
Of course!
The more the merrier!

39:24.462 --> 39:25.528
Great! Tom?

39:25.530 --> 39:28.331
I have some work to finish up,
so probably shouldn't.

39:28.333 --> 39:32.068
You wouldn't wanna come anyways.
We're just going to see the lions.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.669
Do not leave without me.

39:35.573 --> 39:37.473
See what I mean? Lions.

39:48.787 --> 39:51.654
Whoo! OK!

39:51.656 --> 39:52.955
Those are African wild dogs.

39:52.957 --> 39:54.557
They're also called
painted wolves

39:54.559 --> 39:56.859
because of the colouring
of their coats.

39:56.861 --> 39:58.394
Wow, they are so beautiful!

39:58.396 --> 40:00.530
- And their ears are so round!
- I know!

40:00.532 --> 40:03.933
There are less than 4,000 of
these left on the continent.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.201
- Yeah.
- Wow!

40:05.203 --> 40:07.136
You hear that little
squeaking noise?

40:07.138 --> 40:08.437
That's their bark.

40:08.439 --> 40:09.605
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:09.607 --> 40:11.174
All right,
I know they're adorable,

40:11.176 --> 40:13.176
but what do you say
we go find those lions?

40:13.178 --> 40:14.644
- Yep!
- Yeah, let's do that.

40:14.646 --> 40:15.945
Yeah? OK!

40:21.986 --> 40:23.653
Bye, puppies!

40:30.595 --> 40:32.995
Hey! Over there! It's a lion!

40:35.066 --> 40:36.732
There's more over there too.

40:38.336 --> 40:40.870
They're just so magnificent,
aren't they?

40:48.046 --> 40:50.546
You sure it's OK that
we're this close to them?

40:50.548 --> 40:53.049
Of course! Yeah.
No, they're really chill.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.484
They tend to hunt at night.
So we're fine.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.153
Just stay in the vehicle,

40:57.155 --> 41:00.890
and don't make any loud noises
or sudden movements, OK?

41:00.892 --> 41:03.359
There's nothing
to worry about, folks, OK?

41:03.361 --> 41:05.261
We're not even
on their food chain.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.331
It's incredible!

41:08.333 --> 41:09.599
- Never gets old.
- No.

41:09.601 --> 41:12.101
There's nothing like
seeing them in real life.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.036
Oh yeah.
That's the life!

41:14.038 --> 41:16.772
That's you on a Saturday
afternoon, John.

41:16.774 --> 41:18.774
Hey, are they endangered?

41:18.776 --> 41:20.476
Well, they're certainly at risk.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.112
Unfortunately, the lion
population here in Africa

41:23.114 --> 41:24.981
has fallen by almost half
since the '90s.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.350
- Almost half?
- Indeed.

41:27.352 --> 41:28.784
That's a lot!

41:28.786 --> 41:30.386
Look at his mane!

41:30.388 --> 41:32.622
Yeah! Pretty crazy, isn't it?

41:32.624 --> 41:34.557
- They're just enormous!
- I know.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.366
Thank you.

41:43.368 --> 41:47.904
Tom, those lions were a great sight!
Incredible!

41:47.906 --> 41:50.306
You know their canines
can grow up to 4 inches?

41:50.308 --> 41:53.209
Think about that.
That's 8 inches in total.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.711
A walking Wikipedia page.

41:55.713 --> 41:58.180
I really should get him
a T -shirt that says that.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.517
It's good being so invested
in something.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.185
Yeah, I just wish
he'd stop thinking

42:03.187 --> 42:04.720
he could do everything
by himself.

42:04.722 --> 42:07.490
It's why I think the job in
the States might be good for him.

42:07.492 --> 42:08.457
What job?

42:08.459 --> 42:11.694
He got an offer to head up a
wildlife conservation group.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.496
They're based out of New York, so...

42:13.498 --> 42:14.497
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:14.499 --> 42:17.066
- Is he gonna take it?
- He says he's not.

42:17.068 --> 42:22.204
- I can't see him ever leaving Ukuthula, but...
- But if Warrington buys it...

42:22.206 --> 42:24.573
Sorry. I really didn't
mean to bring that up.

42:24.575 --> 42:26.242
It's OK.

42:26.244 --> 42:29.679
Listen, I know selling the
reserve is a big deal.

42:29.681 --> 42:32.715
I understand. Listen,
I'm not going anywhere.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.650
They couldn't pry me off
this land.

42:34.652 --> 42:38.154
- You wouldn't go with Tom?
- No. No, why would I?

42:38.156 --> 42:40.923
Well, I just thought
since you guys are...

42:43.061 --> 42:45.628
Well, you know, because
you and he are... You're...

42:45.630 --> 42:47.196
Oh no. No, no, no!

42:47.198 --> 42:50.132
No, Tom is my brother.
Well, my stepbrother, actually.

42:50.134 --> 42:52.802
His mom married my dad
when we were really little.

42:54.906 --> 42:57.974
- I am so sorry!
- It's OK!

42:57.976 --> 42:59.608
It's so embarrassing!
I'm sorry.

42:59.610 --> 43:03.045
- What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
- I do! Yeah, Brad.

43:03.047 --> 43:04.447
He's just... He's great.

43:04.449 --> 43:06.582
He's dependable,
and he's just great.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.517
That's great!

43:08.519 --> 43:09.485
Yeah.

43:09.487 --> 43:10.686
Should we head in?

43:10.688 --> 43:11.887
- Yeah!
- OK!

43:17.095 --> 43:19.462
- Hey!
- Hey!

43:19.464 --> 43:22.465
- That's not work, is it?
- Sort of.

43:23.534 --> 43:27.036
Sorry, I should've asked.
Do you want one?

43:27.038 --> 43:28.004
Cheers!

43:28.006 --> 43:29.238
Great minds!

43:30.274 --> 43:32.375
- May I?
- Of course!

43:32.377 --> 43:34.877
So, what you working on?

43:34.879 --> 43:38.447
Well, I'm just kind of playing
around with the Ukuthula website.

43:38.449 --> 43:39.582
Can I see?

43:41.085 --> 43:43.686
I'll show you if you just promise
to keep in mind

43:43.688 --> 43:45.321
that this is a work in progress.

43:45.323 --> 43:47.356
Those zebras
I was telling you about?

43:47.358 --> 43:49.658
Honestly, they use the Internet
more than I do.

43:50.628 --> 43:51.628
Fine!

43:52.897 --> 43:54.296
Here you go.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.432
So, see, it would have
reservations,

43:56.434 --> 43:59.435
and then people could also browse
the tours and excursions

43:59.437 --> 44:00.970
and book things ahead of time.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.171
And I was thinking

44:02.173 --> 44:04.573
that if you set up cameras
around the reserve,

44:04.575 --> 44:06.709
people could just look
at the lion cam

44:06.711 --> 44:08.144
or the elephant cam or...

44:08.146 --> 44:10.546
<i>It's hard to believe
that only 100 years ago,</i>

44:10.548 --> 44:13.282
<i>there were over 3 million
elephants roaming Africa.</i>

44:13.284 --> 44:15.785
<i>And now there's fewer
than half a million left.</i>

44:17.021 --> 44:19.488
Kira, I'm blown away.
This is brilliant!

44:19.490 --> 44:21.757
You did all of this
in a couple of days?

44:21.759 --> 44:24.760
Yeah, well, it's not actually
hooked up to anything yet,

44:24.762 --> 44:26.295
but I was hoping

44:26.297 --> 44:29.432
that maybe Artie Warrington
would let me consult, you know?

44:29.434 --> 44:31.700
I mean, I could run the site
from Chicago.

44:32.737 --> 44:34.003
Of course!

44:36.340 --> 44:38.107
I'm speechless.

44:38.109 --> 44:39.775
Best leave you to it.

44:40.912 --> 44:42.378
Hey, Tom...

44:43.614 --> 44:45.581
Good night.

44:45.583 --> 44:48.184
Good night, Kira.

44:59.664 --> 45:02.798
Good evening, Kira.
I'm leaving soon.

45:02.800 --> 45:05.000
But I wanted to let you know

45:05.002 --> 45:07.169
that a staff member
is on standby

45:07.171 --> 45:09.805
to get you whatever
you may need tonight.

45:09.807 --> 45:12.875
Lwazi, you don't have
to keep doing that.

45:12.877 --> 45:16.345
- Doing what?
- Treating me like royalty.

45:16.347 --> 45:19.615
Really, I have a feeling
it has something to do

45:19.617 --> 45:21.717
with the sale of the reserve.

45:21.719 --> 45:26.555
We simply want you to experience
everything Ukuthula has to offer.

45:26.557 --> 45:29.024
And I appreciate it
so much, but...

45:30.261 --> 45:32.561
But you know
I can't keep it, right?

45:32.563 --> 45:33.929
I'd be so lost here.

45:33.931 --> 45:38.501
There's a proverb.
"To get lost is to learn the way".

45:38.503 --> 45:42.338
You know, Tom thinks that you just
make these up to win arguments.

45:42.340 --> 45:44.140
And it works every time!

45:47.578 --> 45:50.446
You and him and, really,
everyone that works here,

45:50.448 --> 45:52.414
it's... it's like one big family.

45:52.416 --> 45:54.183
Oh yes, it is!

45:54.185 --> 45:58.821
You know, when I came here,
I was very young.

45:58.823 --> 46:00.556
I was a housekeeper!

46:00.558 --> 46:03.626
And that's not what I had planned!

46:03.628 --> 46:06.595
- What did you want to be?
- A singer!

46:06.597 --> 46:09.932
Wait, I remember you used to
sing to get me to go to bed.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.433
Wait, what...
what was the song?

46:34.525 --> 46:36.458
Yeah.

46:36.460 --> 46:40.129
- You have a pretty voice.
- Thank you.

46:40.131 --> 46:43.232
You know,
if I had been a singer,

46:43.234 --> 46:46.769
I may not have met my husband

46:46.771 --> 46:50.773
or had my children
or my grandchildren.

46:52.009 --> 46:55.711
I wouldn't have this family
I have here.

46:56.881 --> 46:59.081
So no regrets.

47:00.051 --> 47:02.251
And my point is

47:02.253 --> 47:05.955
sometimes the universe
shows us the way,

47:05.957 --> 47:09.258
even though we don't know
we're looking.

47:09.260 --> 47:11.427
Another proverb?

47:12.897 --> 47:15.598
Well, I just made up that one.

47:18.603 --> 47:21.403
Well, good night, Kira.

47:21.405 --> 47:22.905
Lwazi.

47:22.907 --> 47:24.840
Good night.

47:26.277 --> 47:28.077
Thank you.

47:28.079 --> 47:30.913
- Love you.
- You too.

47:45.463 --> 47:48.397
I think I might melt my phone
from all the photos I'm taking.

47:50.334 --> 47:53.636
- Wait, is it your birthday?
- No, it's the day after tomorrow.

47:53.638 --> 47:55.537
This is my friend Vicky
from work.

47:55.539 --> 47:57.806
She likes to stretch birthdays out
into an event

47:57.808 --> 47:59.608
and tweet about it
to the entire world.

47:59.610 --> 48:01.243
OK, well,
we need to have a party.

48:01.245 --> 48:04.647
- We don't need to have a party, no.
- Why not?

48:04.649 --> 48:07.049
Because I don't want you
to go through the trouble,

48:07.051 --> 48:08.384
and I'm not 6.

48:08.386 --> 48:10.753
Well, excuse you! Everybody
needs to have a party.

48:10.755 --> 48:12.821
I promise you, I will
keep it very dignified.

48:12.823 --> 48:15.924
What colour blindfolds would you like
for Pin the Tail on the Donkey?

48:16.894 --> 48:18.694
- There you are!
- Hey!

48:18.696 --> 48:21.130
- Come on, you have to see this.
- What is it?

48:21.132 --> 48:24.466
- Just come on!
- OK!

48:39.517 --> 48:43.352
That one right there,
that's Kimba and her calf.

48:43.354 --> 48:44.887
Kimba's baby!

48:48.159 --> 48:50.459
- Hey, Kira!
- What?

48:51.862 --> 48:53.529
And...

48:54.532 --> 48:56.231
Perfect!

48:58.969 --> 49:01.570
I just...

49:05.643 --> 49:06.709
Thank you.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.280
Wow!

49:13.284 --> 49:17.086
- Thank you!
- For what?

49:17.088 --> 49:19.588
For what?
What do you mean, for what?

49:19.590 --> 49:22.424
For elephants, for, those
baby elephants!

49:22.426 --> 49:24.460
Kimba did all the hard work there.

49:25.629 --> 49:27.262
Yeah, she did. It's true.

49:27.264 --> 49:29.732
I wouldn't have seen that
if it weren't for you!

49:29.734 --> 49:31.667
I wouldn't have seen any of this.
Just...

49:31.669 --> 49:32.634
Thank you!

49:32.636 --> 49:34.002
- You're welcome.
- Kira, I...

49:34.004 --> 49:37.272
- Kira!
- Brad!

49:38.242 --> 49:39.908
Surprise!

49:44.615 --> 49:46.048
It's so hot here.

49:46.050 --> 49:49.251
Please, please tell me all the
rooms have air-conditioning.

49:49.253 --> 49:51.186
I just can't believe
you're here!

49:51.188 --> 49:53.155
Well, it's part
of your birthday surprise!

49:54.325 --> 49:56.291
See, I was gonna fly
to Scottsdale, but...

49:56.293 --> 49:58.861
But you just hopped on a plane
instead to Africa?

49:58.863 --> 50:00.796
You did. Why can't I?

50:00.798 --> 50:02.264
Aren't you happy to see me?

50:02.266 --> 50:04.767
- Of course!
- Yeah, I'm... I'm just...

50:04.769 --> 50:07.569
Surprised?
See, that's the whole idea.

50:07.571 --> 50:10.239
I also figured you might need
some help with the sale.

50:10.241 --> 50:12.975
- Sale?
- Of the reserve.

50:12.977 --> 50:15.110
You see, the last time we spoke,

50:15.112 --> 50:19.481
you seemed a bit, I don't know, confused
about what to do with this place.

50:19.483 --> 50:21.450
I wouldn't say "confused," really.

50:21.452 --> 50:22.818
Maybe conflicted.

50:22.820 --> 50:26.522
But I know I have no choice.
I mean, I can't keep it.

50:26.524 --> 50:28.757
- Have you signed the deal?
- Not yet.

50:28.759 --> 50:30.459
Why not?
What are you waiting for?

50:30.461 --> 50:32.694
I wanna make sure it's
the right thing to do.

50:32.696 --> 50:36.465
It is the right thing to do!
Trust me, I'm Spreadsheet Guy.

50:36.467 --> 50:39.101
- Remember?
- Yeah.

50:40.304 --> 50:43.138
It's, like, a billion degrees
out here.

50:44.108 --> 50:45.607
How can you stand it?

50:45.609 --> 50:48.043
You know, I think
I've just gotten used to it.

50:48.045 --> 50:50.479
Brad, this place, it just...

50:50.481 --> 50:53.015
It has a way of just
changing your whole way

50:53.017 --> 50:54.316
of looking at things.

50:54.318 --> 50:56.685
You know what, we'll go
on an excursion tomorrow,

50:56.687 --> 50:58.620
and you'll see
what I'm talking about.

50:58.622 --> 51:00.756
You're gonna love it here.
I promise.

51:10.301 --> 51:13.235
- You all right, there, Brad?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

51:14.305 --> 51:16.505
It's just a bit, you know...

51:16.507 --> 51:18.974
It's hot. How much further
do we have to go?

51:18.976 --> 51:20.576
About 4 hours.

51:21.879 --> 51:23.946
I mean, is it safe
to walk around like this?

51:24.982 --> 51:26.582
This is the middle of the jungle.

51:26.584 --> 51:29.084
Yes! Everything's gonna be fine.

51:29.086 --> 51:31.987
OK, seriously, how much
further do we have to go?

51:31.989 --> 51:34.456
- See those rocks?
- Yeah.

51:34.458 --> 51:35.824
That's the end.

51:35.826 --> 51:38.627
I promise it'll be worth it
when you see this view.

51:39.630 --> 51:41.363
Well, you know,
if nothing else,

51:41.365 --> 51:43.499
I'm getting in all my steps
for the day.

51:43.501 --> 51:47.202
You should be getting extra, considering
you're climbing a hill in Africa.

51:47.204 --> 51:50.706
I wonder...
Is there a setting for that?

51:50.708 --> 51:54.676
Brad! Brad! Look at this!

51:54.678 --> 51:56.078
I mean...

51:56.080 --> 51:59.147
can you imagine waking up
to this view every day?

52:00.618 --> 52:03.051
We walked all the way
from there.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.788
Yeah, that's...
that's quite a hike.

52:08.125 --> 52:09.458
It's beautiful,

52:09.460 --> 52:11.927
but, you know, so is Chicago
on a summer morning.

52:11.929 --> 52:13.128
Brad!

52:13.130 --> 52:14.730
Look, there's a giraffe!

52:14.732 --> 52:18.066
Yeah, we've seen 'em at the zoo.

52:18.068 --> 52:22.538
No, it's so much more magical
seeing them roaming free.

52:23.507 --> 52:26.575
Hey, careful, Kira. You're
starting to sound like Tom!

52:27.678 --> 52:32.714
It's beautiful, I guess.
It's breathtaking.

52:52.937 --> 52:56.905
- Hey, you!
- Hey!

52:56.907 --> 52:59.708
- Did you have fun today?
- Yeah!

52:59.710 --> 53:01.810
Yeah, I can see
why you like it here.

53:01.812 --> 53:03.679
But I... I gotta admit,

53:03.681 --> 53:05.881
I can't wait to get back
to civilization.

53:05.883 --> 53:08.917
- Is that the Warrington offer?
- It is.

53:08.919 --> 53:11.086
I just was wanting to look at it
one more time.

53:11.088 --> 53:13.889
It's a good offer.
The lawyers think so too.

53:13.891 --> 53:16.224
I know they do, Brad,
but I have to make sure

53:16.226 --> 53:17.926
that Ukuthula's being protected.

53:17.928 --> 53:20.896
- The animals and the people and...
- I get it.

53:20.898 --> 53:23.765
I tell you what, why don't I look
at it one more time?

53:24.702 --> 53:26.234
OK.

53:26.236 --> 53:28.770
I mean, if that's what
you wanna do, great.

53:28.772 --> 53:31.373
- Thanks.
- Of course.

53:31.375 --> 53:33.475
I've got a conference
call with Chicago now,

53:33.477 --> 53:34.977
so I'll look at it
when I'm done?

53:34.979 --> 53:36.712
Yeah, thank you.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.423
What are you doing?

53:48.425 --> 53:49.758
Nothing.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.761
- I'm just...
- Nothing. OK.

53:52.763 --> 53:56.465
- Would you just go talk to her?
- About what?

53:56.467 --> 54:00.068
Tom, I've seen the way
that you look at her.

54:00.070 --> 54:03.672
The other day your smile was so big,
I thought your face was gonna break.

54:03.674 --> 54:07.843
Well, it was a happy moment!
There was a baby elephant and...

54:07.845 --> 54:08.944
Just go talk to her.

54:09.913 --> 54:12.881
She has a boyfriend, Ally.
And he's here.

54:12.883 --> 54:14.282
Yeah.

54:14.284 --> 54:18.286
I didn't say challenge him to a duel
and carry her off on your shoulder.

54:19.390 --> 54:20.856
Just go talk to her!

54:25.062 --> 54:27.796
- Hey!
- Hey!

54:27.798 --> 54:31.733
- Where's Brad?
- He's in his room, trying to stay cool.

54:31.735 --> 54:35.137
I guess it is pretty warm.
I don't even notice it anymore.

54:35.139 --> 54:37.072
Yeah, me neither.

54:39.576 --> 54:42.644
I get the feeling he doesn't
like it here very much.

54:42.646 --> 54:44.379
It's just different.
He'll be OK.

54:45.949 --> 54:48.684
I gotta say, it was nice for
him to travel all this way.

54:48.686 --> 54:49.951
I don't think I have anyone

54:49.953 --> 54:52.020
who'd come halfway across
the world for me.

54:52.022 --> 54:54.256
Really? There's nobody
special in your life?

54:54.258 --> 54:55.557
Well, I have the animals.

54:56.794 --> 54:58.894
But I'm here pretty much
all the time, right,

54:58.896 --> 55:01.329
so it doesn't leave a lot
of room for a social life.

55:01.331 --> 55:04.900
...Is that something you want?

55:04.902 --> 55:05.867
Yeah!

55:05.869 --> 55:09.938
I mean, I'm not exactly the
white-picket fence kind of guy, but...

55:09.940 --> 55:13.408
Yeah. They don't exactly
hold back elephants.

55:13.410 --> 55:14.910
No.

55:14.912 --> 55:17.879
But, you know, marriage, kids,

55:17.881 --> 55:19.781
happily ever after...

55:19.783 --> 55:22.184
- Yeah?
- Of course I want that.

55:22.186 --> 55:25.687
I just need it with someone who
loves this place as much as I do.

55:28.258 --> 55:32.527
This is just...
This has been a weird week.

55:33.564 --> 55:37.766
Well, I guess the question is has
it been weird-good or weird-bad?

55:37.768 --> 55:39.267
Definitely weird-good.

55:39.269 --> 55:42.504
I never thought I'd go this
far out of my comfort zone.

55:42.506 --> 55:44.940
I don't think you're
necessarily outside of it.

55:44.942 --> 55:46.975
I think maybe
you've just made it bigger.

55:46.977 --> 55:48.910
Maybe.

55:48.912 --> 55:50.879
I guess, now when
you get back to Chicago,

55:50.881 --> 55:53.648
you can sign up for sky-diving
lessons or something, right?

55:53.650 --> 55:54.816
No! No way, skydiving!

55:54.818 --> 55:56.351
Excuse me, could you tell me

55:56.353 --> 55:58.920
how I might be able to get
to Johannesburg, please?

55:58.922 --> 56:00.255
Not a problem. This way.

56:13.270 --> 56:15.137
Mr. Wilson!
Thanks for your call.

56:15.139 --> 56:16.571
This is nice.

56:16.573 --> 56:19.241
"Exceptional"
is the Warrington brand.

56:19.243 --> 56:22.210
So, you're here
representing Kira Slater.

56:22.212 --> 56:25.280
Yes.
I'm her financial advisor.

56:26.750 --> 56:28.316
And what's your advice?

56:28.318 --> 56:31.787
- To get this deal closed as soon as possible.
- That is good to hear.

56:31.789 --> 56:35.090
I was getting concerned
that we weren't moving forward.

56:35.092 --> 56:37.292
No, no. We're definitely
moving forward.

56:37.294 --> 56:38.294
Kira...

56:39.429 --> 56:43.465
- Kira just wants to add a few conditions.
- What sort of conditions?

56:43.467 --> 56:47.202
Some negotiating points
to do with continuing

56:47.204 --> 56:50.238
to care for the wildlife
and the land.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.474
- That sort of thing.
- Look, trust me.

56:52.476 --> 56:56.711
Here at Warrington's, we're all about
preserving the wilderness experience.

56:56.713 --> 57:00.715
Well, then...
I guess we're good to go.

57:01.652 --> 57:03.185
Come, I'll show you around.

57:03.187 --> 57:04.586
Great!

57:27.444 --> 57:31.246
Hi there! Where have you been?
I was looking for you earlier.

57:31.248 --> 57:34.216
I was planning a surprise
for your birthday.

57:34.218 --> 57:36.651
- You don't have to do...
- I know, but I did anyway.

57:36.653 --> 57:38.587
Trust me, you're gonna love it.

57:39.957 --> 57:42.858
I don't know about you,
but I am starving.

57:42.860 --> 57:46.394
Me too. Let's go see what S'bu's
got cooked up for dinner.

57:46.396 --> 57:47.796
All right!

57:55.272 --> 57:59.575
- Good morning, Kira! Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

58:01.545 --> 58:04.145
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure!

58:04.147 --> 58:07.115
Lwazi, I've been thinking
about what you said,

58:07.117 --> 58:10.051
about how the people
here are one big family.

58:10.053 --> 58:13.788
It's so obvious this is
more than just a job.

58:13.790 --> 58:17.158
- Ukuthula's like a home.
- It is in many ways.

58:17.160 --> 58:21.229
So, what if I sell it to you,
and to all the employees?

58:21.231 --> 58:24.866
That way you and Tom and Ally, you
can make sure it doesn't change.

58:24.868 --> 58:28.803
That's a very kind thought, but
I don't know how that would work.

58:28.805 --> 58:31.006
Even if everyone pooled
our resources,

58:31.008 --> 58:32.307
we wouldn't have enough.

58:32.309 --> 58:35.210
I'll sell it to you for a dollar.
I'll give it to you.

58:35.212 --> 58:39.714
That is remarkably generous. But
running a reserve is expensive.

58:39.716 --> 58:42.050
That's why I couldn't
do it myself.

58:42.052 --> 58:45.820
That's why, we just need
someone with deep pockets...

58:47.958 --> 58:50.992
someone like Artie Warrington.

58:50.994 --> 58:53.595
Hey, there you are!
Happy birthday!

58:53.597 --> 58:57.332
- Thank you! Have you seen Tom?
- Tom? No. Why?

58:57.334 --> 59:00.201
It's a long story, but I might
have to take care of something.

59:00.203 --> 59:01.670
Are you gonna be OK by yourself?

59:01.672 --> 59:04.139
I thought we were gonna spend
your birthday together.

59:04.141 --> 59:06.641
We are. We will. It's just
this is really important.

59:06.643 --> 59:09.644
Not as important as the
birthday surprise I planned.

59:09.646 --> 59:11.346
I can't wait to find out
what it is.

59:11.348 --> 59:13.648
But I have to take care of this.
I'll be back soon.

59:13.650 --> 59:14.749
Kira, wait!

59:14.751 --> 59:16.651
I don't know what's going on
with you

59:16.653 --> 59:17.852
since you got here, OK...

59:17.854 --> 59:19.754
Brad, this about saving Ukuthula.

59:19.756 --> 59:23.959
Until last week, you hadn't thought
about this place in decades.

59:23.961 --> 59:25.827
I mean,
what's so important now?

59:25.829 --> 59:28.897
I loved this place
when I was a kid.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.532
I loved how it made me feel,

59:30.534 --> 59:32.000
just free and empowered

59:32.002 --> 59:35.270
and like I was a part of
something bigger than myself.

59:35.272 --> 59:37.806
And all that's come
rushing back and I...

59:37.808 --> 59:40.442
I just can't let it go
without a fight.

59:42.612 --> 59:43.812
I'll hurry.

01:00:01.865 --> 01:00:04.332
Kira! What are you doing here?

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:07.602
I wanna find a way
to save Ukuthula.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.572
You wanna find a way
to save Ukuthula?

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:12.607
I was gonna wish you
a happy birthday,

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.476
but we could talk about
your thing.

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:15.944
I own Ukuthula.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.847
It's incredibly strange for me
to say that, but it's true.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:20.181
So, it's my responsibility

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:22.217
to make sure nothing bad
happens to it.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.252
It's what my Uncle Irv
would've wanted.

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:28.023
- So, you wanna keep it?
- I wanna keep it in the family.

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:29.424
Tom, I wanna protect it.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:33.962
- Right. Because keeping it would be...
- It'd be crazy and impossible.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.731
And, I mean, even if I had
the money to keep it going,

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:37.832
what am I gonna do?

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.768
Am I really gonna give up
my entire life

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.970
to move to Africa
to run a wildlife reserve?

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:46.674
- Why not?
- Because it's crazy.

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:51.379
It's... It's...

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:56.251
We need to go to Johannesburg.

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:57.986
OK!

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:26.314
Kira! I wasn't expecting you!

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:29.217
And Tom Anderson. I certainly
wasn't expecting you.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.886
How you doing, Artie?

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:34.355
It depends on what the two
of you are doing here.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.658
- You ganging up on me?
- No, it's nothing like that.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.660
Kira's got a proposal
she'd like you to hear.

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:40.328
Please join me.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:48.570
Last time we spoke,

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:51.172
you said that you understood
just how special Ukuthula is

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.807
and how you wanna protect that.

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:53.808
Absolutely.

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:55.510
Of course, we need
to make some changes

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:56.978
to fit into
the Warrington brand,

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.813
but I'm confident
we can strike a balance

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:00.381
between progress
and preservation.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:03.618
That's great to hear, because
what I wanna suggest is,

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.655
instead of buying Ukuthula,
why don't you invest in it?

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.225
Become a partner with us,
with me.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:13.495
Help us make Ukuthula the
best it can possibly be.

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:16.798
Not to sound selfish, but what
do I get out of this arrangement?

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.435
Well, we could put your logo on all
the vehicles and in all the lodges.

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:23.705
You'd be rebranding yourself as
a corporation with a conscience.

01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:25.540
And what could be better
than preserving

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:27.375
a threatened ecosystem
like the Savanna?

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:28.543
It's a great pitch!

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:31.446
- So, you're interested.
- In investing? No.

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:34.549
But it's a great marketing angle
for the project once we buy.

01:02:34.551 --> 01:02:37.185
Look, everyone knows
Ukuthula's a sinking ship.

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:39.454
That's why mine's the
only offer on the table,

01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:42.690
because I'm the only one with
a vision to see what it could be.

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:45.260
So I'm giving you 2 days,
till noon Saturday.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.329
Be here to sign the contract,
or my offer's withdrawn.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:52.600
Artie. I'll sign it!

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.704
- Kira, you do not need to sign.
- What choice do we have?

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:59.307
- But I'll need a revised offer.
- Revised how?

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:02.810
One that puts protections in place
for the people and the animals.

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:05.713
Your financial advisor already
talked to me about that.

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.415
I'm sorry.
My financial advisor?

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.551
Brad Wilson.
He came to see me yesterday.

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:12.453
I told him we don't need to put
all of that in the contract,

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.922
and he agreed.

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:16.224
Look, you can trust me.

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:17.926
Two days!

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.044
Hey! There you are!
Happy birthday!

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:38.413
Thank you!
Do you know where Brad is?

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:40.548
I think he's in the boma
for dinner.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.683
OK.

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:44.953
What's going on?

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:47.822
It's a long story, but she's not
very happy with him right now.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.090
Uh-oh!

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:50.491
- Why "uh-oh"?
- Come on!

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:02.737
Happy birthday, Kira!

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.423
That was so beautiful!

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:25.593
Thank you so much!
That was beautiful.

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.929
Tom has something
he wants to say.

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:35.236
They say judge not your beauty

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:37.605
by the number of people
who look at you

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:40.908
but rather by the number of
people who smile at you.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:44.312
None of us know
what'll happen tomorrow,

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:47.515
but what we do know
is that tonight,

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:51.552
this boma is full of smiles
because of you.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:55.523
- Happy birthday, Kira.
- Happy birthday, Kira!

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:56.991
Thank you!

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:59.727
You didn't need to do this.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.765
It was Irving's favourite.

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:10.905
And it's Kimba's baby!

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.710
Thank you!

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:17.645
- Speech!
- Yes!

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.914
- Yes!
- Speech!

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.349
I'm not good at speeches.

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:25.320
OK, I... I just...

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:28.556
I guess I wanna say thank
you, really, so much.

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:30.425
Thank you for everything.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:32.960
You know, being here has been...

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:35.730
Well, it's been life-changing.

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:38.499
And it's not just because of
the land and the animals,

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:39.567
but it's...

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:42.036
it's really because
of the people.

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:43.971
- So sweet!
- Truly.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.407
So thank you.

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:47.475
Hear, hear!

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:54.515
OK! Now it's my turn.

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:01.155
Open it.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.798
Kira Slater, will you marry me?

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:26.214
Kira!

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.751
Kira! What is going on?

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:33.221
Brad, how could you go see Artie
Warrington without telling me?

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:34.722
You asked for my help.

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:36.991
To review the contract,
not negotiate it.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:38.426
You went behind my back.

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:41.295
Kira, I'm sorry, OK?
I was just trying to help.

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.898
You know, we both know
I'm better with the numbers.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.868
- I'm Spreadsheet Guy!
- I don't want Spreadsheet Guy!

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:48.669
I want someone who respects me.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:51.806
We want the same things, OK? We
wanna get married, have kids.

01:06:51.808 --> 01:06:54.609
We wanna have the nice house
with the white picket fence.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:56.144
Right?

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:58.179
Right.

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:01.215
But I understand, OK?

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:04.085
I completely get
you didn't expect this,

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:06.788
and there's been a lot of that
this week.

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:09.357
I mean, first your uncle,
then Africa.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.659
You inherited a reserve!

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:16.130
Yeah, it's been a lot.

01:07:17.467 --> 01:07:20.101
Maybe we should
discuss this tomorrow.

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:24.071
I just...
I have a lot to think about.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.607
Kira...

01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:57.505
Ally, here.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:08:01.008
I'm at the ranger station
right now, both eyes on hippos.

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.443
Both eyes.

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:03.744
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:05.313
Hey!

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:08.316
Did you talk to Kira?

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:11.385
Ally, just leave it alone.

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:15.590
- Why are you acting like this?
- Acting like what?

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:18.725
Tom, you're the person who
always wants to fix things.

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:21.529
And you're the person who always
tells me not to, so...

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:23.930
Exactly, and you've never
listened to me before,

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.666
so why are you starting now?

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:29.036
You like to fix things, Tom.

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:31.072
So fix this!

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.947
I don't know how. OK?

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.716
I mean, Kira, the reserve,
all of it.

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.917
I've turned it over in
my head a million times.

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:47.587
I thought I could get her to
fall in love with this place.

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.890
And I think I did.

01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:53.160
- But what I wasn't expecting was to...
- Was to fall in love with her.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.067
All I've done is make
things more complicated.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.669
For everyone.

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:03.638
Hey, come here.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.506
Come here!

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:08.776
It's gonna be OK.

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:18.319
- Thanks, Sis.
- Yeah, no problem.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:33.167
- You look like you could use this.
- Thank you.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:36.837
It was an eventful evening.

01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:39.540
That's one way of putting it.

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:44.111
I don't suppose you have any
insightful proverbs for me

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.379
about all this, do you?

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.647
Not really.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:53.554
In the end, it is up to you
to decide what makes you happy.

01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:55.389
Right.

01:09:56.759 --> 01:10:00.161
Is there someone who could take
me up to the hilltop lookout?

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:04.398
- I thought you'd already been there.
- I have, but...

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.134
I just didn't really get a
chance to see the view.

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:11.172
I'll call one of the rangers
to take you.

01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:12.273
Thank you.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:14.335
- Hey!
- Hey! I've been looking for you.

01:11:14.337 --> 01:11:17.838
- I went to the hilltop lookout.
- See anything interesting?

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:22.343
I did! Yeah, I did, but...

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:27.415
It was what I didn't see
that most interesting.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:29.050
What's that?

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:32.353
No picket fences.

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.956
I thought we both wanted that.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.592
Is this because I went
to Warrington?

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:41.696
It's because you didn't
respect me enough

01:11:41.698 --> 01:11:45.099
to speak to me first about
what I wanted to do.

01:11:45.101 --> 01:11:47.334
I own Ukuthula.

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:50.471
And I feel like you look at me
as someone who...

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:52.106
who needs to be protected

01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:54.542
instead of a woman
who's fully capable

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:56.343
of making her own decisions,

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:59.346
A partner, an equal.

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:03.751
- We can fix this.
- No, Brad, this isn't something you just fix.

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:08.456
Is this because of Tom?
You're in love with him.

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:12.193
No. This is because of me.

01:12:12.195 --> 01:12:14.361
This place has changed you.

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:19.600
You know, when I was a kid,
I loved adventure.

01:12:19.602 --> 01:12:22.903
I walked up to an elephant
when I was 10 years old.

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:25.272
And this place,
being here has just...

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:28.342
It's made me realize I
still love adventure.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.878
This place hasn't changed me.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.313
It's...

01:12:33.416 --> 01:12:35.916
It's reminding me
of who I really am.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.790
I'm sorry.

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:52.066
Well, I guess
I'll be leaving, then.

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.449
OK, so, I'm gonna take
the Harrises out at 3:00,

01:13:08.451 --> 01:13:10.918
and then I'll come back
and I'll get the Bagwells

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.086
for their sunset drive.

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:13.354
Good!

01:13:13.356 --> 01:13:15.389
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
Just 2 things.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.092
Brad's gonna need a ride
back to the landing strip.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.594
- Is he leaving?
- Yes.

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:23.264
- And you're staying?
- Yeah.

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:28.035
- Are you OK?
- Yes, I am.

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:30.671
OK! Well, then, I can arrange
for the transportation.

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:32.139
- Great.
- What's the 2nd thing?

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.508
Lwazi, do you think
that someone could bring me

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:35.810
some food and some coffee?

01:13:35.812 --> 01:13:37.244
Like, a whole lot of coffee.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:40.548
- Sure, where do you want it?
- Just in my room would be great.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.049
I've got a lot of work to do.

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:44.351
- Of course!
- Thank you!

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:49.056
Vicky! Vicky, hi! It's Kira.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:52.693
Listen, I really need your help
and all of your Twitter followers.

01:13:54.497 --> 01:13:57.598
Yeah, it's time for me
to get in the shark cage.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.714
You're up early!

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:17.484
Yeah, I was up
most of the night.

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:20.287
I thought I had a solution,
and I redid the website.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:23.057
I tried to get it to go viral,
but it's not working.

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:25.192
Well, these things
don't happen overnight.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:27.061
They do on the Internet.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.896
At least...
At least they're supposed to.

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:36.203
- Tom asked me to give this to you.
- What is it?

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:43.611
It's his letter of resignation.

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:53.120
Come in!

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:57.057
Hey! Just thought I'd come see
how you're doing.

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:58.826
I'm OK.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:01.128
I'm disappointed.

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:02.396
But you know what?

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:05.232
At least Ukuthula
has a shiny new website.

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.735
- When are you heading home?
- Tomorrow.

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:12.973
There's really no reason for me to
stay once I sign those papers at noon.

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:17.211
- Have you talked to Tom?
- Ally, I don't know what to say.

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:19.413
I just feel so responsible.

01:15:19.415 --> 01:15:21.649
The people were depending on me.

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:26.320
And you feel like you let us
down, like you let Tom down.

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:29.523
- Yeah, a little.
- Well...

01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:32.793
That's really silly.

01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:34.695
What?

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.931
- What do you mean?
- Tom likes you, Kira.

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:39.700
And I'm pretty sure
you like him.

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:41.936
Tom's taking that new job.

01:15:41.938 --> 01:15:45.306
I'm going back to Chicago.
Ukuthula's being sold.

01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:49.043
What difference does it make
if Tom and I like each other?

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.713
I think it makes
all the difference in the world.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:57.751
But at the very least...

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:00.821
you should say goodbye.

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:15.536
- Hey!
- Packing up?

01:16:17.707 --> 01:16:19.139
I'm leaving tonight.

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:22.076
- What about you?
- Tomorrow.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.912
Is Brad picking you up
from the airport?

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:29.216
No, I'm gonna be finding
my own way home.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.791
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.526
It's really OK. It was...
it was time.

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:40.561
Right.

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:42.930
But you're still going back
to Chicago.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.799
Yeah, I stayed up all
night just really trying

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:48.268
to find a way
to make it work here and...

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:53.107
I guess I just don't really
have a reason to stay.

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.143
Do I?

01:16:57.813 --> 01:17:00.481
Not after the place
is sold to Warrington.

01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:03.817
And you took the job
in New York?

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:09.823
Not officially, but I'm gonna
call them on Monday, yeah.

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.992
Right.

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:15.062
I mean, I don't really have a
reason to stay here either.

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:16.630
Do I?

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:22.069
I guess not after it's sold.

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:28.042
I have to get to Johannesburg,
but, I just wanted to...

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.345
I just wanna say goodbye.

01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:35.215
Goodbye, Kira.

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:38.218
Bye, Tom.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:41.989
Kira!

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:45.626
Do you need a ride?

01:17:45.628 --> 01:17:46.628
Yeah.

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:49.396
I could be ready in 30 minutes.

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:52.933
- Thanks.
- OK.

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:00.307
Kira!

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:03.410
We have had 16 reservations
in the past 30 minutes!

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:06.747
And over 200 people asking
about the baby elephants.

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:08.215
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:10.918
Look at this! There are 26 now.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.253
Oh, Lwazi, if I could
just have convinced Artie

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:14.388
to partner with us...

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:16.356
With these kind of reservations
coming in,

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.358
if we had a partner...

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:20.961
A partner!

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:23.230
Lwazi, I just got a great idea.

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:25.065
I have to find Tom.

01:18:29.472 --> 01:18:31.138
- All set?
- I was just thinking.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.440
When we were in the village
and went to the school,

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:35.209
you talked about
village partnerships.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:36.510
How does that work?

01:18:36.512 --> 01:18:38.779
When a village is partnered
with the reserve,

01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:40.514
there are benefits
for both parties.

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:43.584
So, is there any reason we
couldn't do that with Ukuthula?

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:46.954
I'm not sure the village could
afford to buy into Ukuthula.

01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:49.523
No, I'll give them
the 50% ownership.

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:52.392
We've had 26... No!

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.362
...32 reservations so far.

01:18:55.364 --> 01:18:56.797
Tom, it's your video!

01:18:56.799 --> 01:18:58.298
It went viral.
It's working.

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.234
I don't wanna sell it
to Warrington.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:02.603
I just didn't think there was
any other way,

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:03.871
but maybe there is.

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:05.839
Well, it can't hurt
to speak to the chief!

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:08.375
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:21.021
This is Kira.

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:12.973
I can't believe
we got this done so quickly.

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:14.641
Yeah, we did it!
Together.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:15.809
Yes!

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.544
How did you come up
with all of this?

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:20.147
Well, Tom had said something
about village partnerships,

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:22.616
and when the reservations
started pouring in, I just...

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:24.651
I don't know, it came
to me as a possibility.

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.253
And we went to meet
with the chief,

01:20:26.255 --> 01:20:27.955
and he was very excited
with the idea.

01:20:27.957 --> 01:20:29.623
None of this
would've been possible

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:31.658
without Kira and the revenue
from our website.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.795
- How many reservations are we at now?
- Let's check.

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:35.929
Over 200!

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:39.533
Including this one.
You have to read this.

01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:43.136
"Can't wait to come back.
Make sure the lions are out.

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:44.805
"John and Evelyn Bagwell".

01:20:46.742 --> 01:20:50.611
- All right! I think it's time to sign.
- OK!

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:54.381
Kira, are you sure about this,
sharing Ukuthula with the staff?

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:57.284
- Yes! Ukuthula's a family.
- Yeah!

01:20:57.286 --> 01:20:59.186
It should belong to all of us.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.825
Chief?

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:18.772
Yow!

01:21:50.539 --> 01:21:53.573
Congratulations, partner.

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:56.243
Congratulations, partner!

01:21:57.813 --> 01:22:01.014
So, what do you think?
Was it worth the risk?

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:04.985
Definitely. Sometimes you just
gotta swim with the sharks.

01:22:04.987 --> 01:22:07.888
- What?
- Never mind.

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.526
You know, all these animals,

01:22:12.528 --> 01:22:15.829
they have no idea that you
probably saved their lives

01:22:15.831 --> 01:22:17.898
or that you brought
hope and power

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.033
to an entire village today.

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:24.004
You're an amazing woman,
Kira Slater.

01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:26.340
Thank you.

01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:29.910
I've also been wondering

01:22:29.912 --> 01:22:32.913
if maybe you'd be willing
to take another risk.

01:22:32.915 --> 01:22:34.948
What's that?

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:47.627
Wow!

01:22:58.707 --> 01:22:59.873
Wow!

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.350
Look at that!
