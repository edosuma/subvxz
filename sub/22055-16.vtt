NARRATOR: To determine whowould face off in the "All-Star"

01:04.788 --> 01:05.996

01:06.100 --> 01:07.446
MICHELLE [VOICEOVER]: Notgetting into the final two

01:07.550 --> 01:08.999
is not an option for me.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.450
NARRATOR: Guest judges fromthe Caesars Entertainment group

01:11.554 --> 01:12.796

Beautiful dish.

01:13.797 --> 01:14.798
I would give Michelle a nine.

01:14.902 --> 01:15.972
Yes.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.284

01:19.527 --> 01:20.459

I think that was
a nine as well.

We're tied again.

Nick.

01:46.451 --> 01:47.348
GORDON: Please.

01:47.452 --> 01:48.487
I'm gonna pick Jennifer.

01:48.591 --> 01:49.971
- Wow.

01:50.075 --> 01:50.869
NICK: Yeah.

01:50.972 --> 01:52.181
GORDON: Dana.
- Van.

01:52.284 --> 01:53.078
GORDON: Van.

01:53.182 --> 01:54.528
VAN: Thank you.
- Milly.

01:54.631 --> 01:55.839
NICK: Yeah, Milly.
GORDON: Let's go.

01:55.943 --> 01:56.909
I'm gonna pick Robyn, chef.

01:57.013 --> 01:58.014
Robyn.

01:58.118 --> 01:58.842
ROBYN [VOICEOVER]: I
kind of knew I was going

01:58.946 --> 01:59.498
to go before Barbie and Elise.

01:59.602 --> 02:00.982
Your last pick?

02:01.086 --> 02:02.915
NARRATOR: But with only
two chefs remaining,

02:03.019 --> 02:05.401
Michelle was left with
a difficult choice.

02:05.504 --> 02:06.885
MICHELLE [VOICEOVER]:
I don't want Elise.

02:06.988 --> 02:08.162
I don't want Barbie.

02:08.266 --> 02:11.821
I'm literally stuck betweena rock and a hard place.

02:11.924 --> 02:14.168
So Michelle, please,
give us the name

02:14.272 --> 02:18.552
of the final person in yourbrigade heading into tomorrow

02:18.655 --> 02:20.278
night's grand finale.

02:20.381 --> 02:21.900
NICK [VOICEOVER]: It'sobviously a tough decision

02:22.003 --> 02:23.798
between Barbie and Elise.

02:23.902 --> 02:25.697
Michelle might be
better off with neither

02:25.800 --> 02:27.561
of these two chefs.

02:27.664 --> 02:31.151
Chef, the next person I'mgoing to pick on my team,

02:31.254 --> 02:33.187
she has a lot of talent.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.534
She's determined, proud.

02:35.638 --> 02:36.915
I'm going to go with Elise.

02:37.018 --> 02:37.812
[cheers and applause]

02:37.916 --> 02:39.193
GORDON: Elise, wow.

02:39.297 --> 02:40.884
ELISE [BENJAMIN]: I'd ratherBenjamin had picked me to be

02:40.988 --> 02:42.369
on his team because
I probably would

02:42.472 --> 02:47.270
have given 250% to make surethat he had a great service.

02:47.374 --> 02:49.893
[applause]

02:51.032 --> 02:52.655
Which means, Benjamin,
you have Barbie.

02:52.758 --> 02:53.587
Barbie, welcome back.

02:53.690 --> 02:56.106
[cheers and applause]

02:57.107 --> 02:58.247
Welcome back.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.593
BENJAMIN [VOICEOVER]: Ihaven't worked with Barbie,

02:59.696 --> 03:00.973
so I don't really
know how she works.

03:01.077 --> 03:02.112
She's kind of the wild card.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.597
You know, I don't know
how she's going to do.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.116
But Elise is just bad energy--

03:06.220 --> 03:08.567
just bad, bad, bad.

03:08.671 --> 03:11.052
GORDON: Right, Michelle,
Benjamin, you have a lot

03:11.156 --> 03:12.192
of work cut out for tonight.

03:12.295 --> 03:13.607
Yes, chef.

03:13.710 --> 03:15.505
You have to go back to Hell'sKitchen now, get your teams up

03:15.609 --> 03:17.680
to speed because
the final dinner

03:17.783 --> 03:21.960
service in Hell's Kitchen willtake place tomorrow night.

03:22.063 --> 03:25.239
One of you will become the headchef of the flagship Hell's

03:25.343 --> 03:26.758
Kitchen Restaurant

03:26.861 --> 03:29.692

03:29.795 --> 03:30.555
[cheers and applause]

03:30.658 --> 03:32.695
This is it.

03:32.798 --> 03:34.283
And may the best chef win.

03:34.386 --> 03:35.180
Off you go.

03:35.284 --> 03:36.181

04:07.108 --> 04:09.973
[music playing]

04:12.113 --> 04:13.667
Here's books for everyone.

04:13.770 --> 04:14.840
NARRATOR: Now that
both finalists

04:14.944 --> 04:16.359
have chosen their brigades--

04:16.463 --> 04:18.085
I'm gonna just write
down the menu first.

04:18.188 --> 04:19.776
NARRATOR: It's time
to review the recipes

04:19.880 --> 04:20.881
they will be cooking.

04:20.984 --> 04:23.366
All right, so
this is the menu.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.782
I'm trying to make this aseasy as possible for all of us

04:25.886 --> 04:27.612
so service runs smoothly.

04:27.715 --> 04:29.096
Milly, you're on
the meat station.

04:29.199 --> 04:30.097
Cool.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.167
Dana, you are on
the fish station.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.237
Ooh.

04:32.341 --> 04:33.756
MICHELLE: Because
you always rock fish.

04:33.859 --> 04:34.688
Garnish for you.

04:34.791 --> 04:36.310
I like rock garnish.

04:36.414 --> 04:38.864
That leaves,
Elise, the appetizer

04:38.968 --> 04:40.487
station, the hamachi crudo.

04:40.590 --> 04:43.006
It's kind of a similar
plate to the salmon.

04:43.110 --> 04:45.561
Do you mind writing all thisdown so you have a checklist?

04:45.664 --> 04:46.665
ELISE [VOICEOVER]:
I really don't

04:46.769 --> 04:47.666
want to be here right now.

04:47.770 --> 04:50.186
I'm not going to
purposely fail, but I'm

04:50.290 --> 04:53.603
not going to lie and say I'mfeeling that overzealous.

04:53.707 --> 04:55.433
I'm just going to keep
my feelings to myself

04:55.536 --> 04:56.986
and do what I have to do.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.332
So everyone feel
good about tomorrow?

04:58.436 --> 04:59.575
MILLY: Yeah.
NICK: Yeah.

04:59.678 --> 05:00.507
I'm gonna turn it up.

05:00.610 --> 05:02.129
MICHELLE: Elise?

05:02.232 --> 05:03.026
Sound good?

05:03.130 --> 05:03.958
It's your show.

05:06.133 --> 05:06.927
I'm just saying like--

05:07.030 --> 05:08.031
She just asked you a question.

05:08.135 --> 05:09.239
Does it sound good?

05:09.343 --> 05:11.690
[ANGRILY] Did
I not answer her?

05:11.794 --> 05:13.002
NICK [VOICEOVER]:
Elise is a sore loser.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.244
She's a bully.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.764
So I'm obviously goingto back up Michelle 100%.

05:16.868 --> 05:18.421
You know, if I can't
be in the finale,

05:18.525 --> 05:20.181
I'm going to help Michelle win.

05:20.285 --> 05:21.838
MICHELLE: We're all goingto be helping each other,

05:21.942 --> 05:23.012
working together.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.254
Because at this point,
it's just like putting

05:24.358 --> 05:25.497
out the best food possible.

05:25.601 --> 05:26.671
Yeah.

05:26.774 --> 05:28.293
DANA [VOICEOVER]: I dothink Elise is going to be

05:28.397 --> 05:30.260
an issue during dinner service.

05:30.364 --> 05:33.298
Michelle better have a plan
B because I think she's

05:33.402 --> 05:34.886
going to need to bust that out.

05:37.544 --> 05:39.753
Questions on
menus for tomorrow?

05:39.856 --> 05:41.306
Are we cool with the
Thai-style quail?

05:41.410 --> 05:42.514
Does that sound good?
VAN: Yep.

05:42.618 --> 05:43.791
And then chicken's goingto come off fish side?

05:43.895 --> 05:45.034
Fine.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.311
BARBIE: The risotto looksreally brown right now.

05:46.415 --> 05:47.243
Using mushroom caps?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.003
- Yeah.- It won't be that brown.

05:49.107 --> 05:49.970
It'd be more like a--

05:50.073 --> 05:51.385
I mean, there's
nothing green on it.

05:51.489 --> 05:53.387
Well, we can also finishit if we want with scallions.

05:53.491 --> 05:54.457
Yeah.

05:54.561 --> 05:56.217
Chives inside and
then scallions on top?

05:56.321 --> 05:57.426
VAN: Yeah.
- Yeah, that's fine.

05:57.529 --> 05:59.048
BENJAMIN [VOICEOVER]: I
feel good about my team.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.808
No chef cooks bythemselves in the kitchen.

06:00.912 --> 06:03.639
You need to be open to
criticism and feedback.

06:03.742 --> 06:05.365
If you're not, you're nevergoing to be successful.

06:05.468 --> 06:06.952
And then that's it?
That's your menu?

06:07.056 --> 06:08.298
BENJAMIN: That's it.
- Fine.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.162
VAN [VOICEOVER]: I'm feelinggood about Benjamin's menu.

06:10.266 --> 06:12.958
If anybody should win this thingright now, it should be Ben.

06:13.062 --> 06:14.546
I'm about to ride or
die for you, brother.

06:14.650 --> 06:15.444
Ride or die.

06:15.547 --> 06:16.376
Yep.

06:16.479 --> 06:19.240
[laughing]

06:21.242 --> 06:23.555
[music playing]

06:23.659 --> 06:25.039
NARRATOR: After a
long night spent

06:25.143 --> 06:27.801
reviewing their finale
menus with their teams--

06:27.904 --> 06:29.250
Oh, my God.

06:29.354 --> 06:30.631
NARRATOR: Benjamin
and Michelle--

06:30.735 --> 06:31.632
Y'all ready?

06:36.844 --> 06:37.811
Morning, chef.

06:37.914 --> 06:38.915
We're going to
have a good day,

06:39.019 --> 06:42.954
be super happy,
positive attitude.

06:43.057 --> 06:43.851
Showtime.

06:43.955 --> 06:45.301
Let's do this.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.372
ROBYN [VOICEOVER]: Yeah, ChefBenjamin, I'm your bitch today.

06:47.476 --> 06:48.304
I'm your bitch.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.754
Let's cook and
have a good time.

06:49.857 --> 06:51.031
Let's keep the momentum going.

06:51.134 --> 06:53.378
Whatever ups and
downs him and I had--

06:53.482 --> 06:55.138
ROBYN: Benjamin, you
got to talk to me.

06:55.242 --> 06:56.139
Relax.

06:56.243 --> 06:57.106
OK, relax.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.210
Where's the pan
for the scallops?

06:58.314 --> 06:59.315
Why is it not down?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.144
Because he didn't tell
me yet to drop them.

07:01.248 --> 07:02.318
- I told you five minutes.- Oh, my God.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.733
I told you four minutes.You make that call.

07:03.837 --> 07:04.665
Come on.

07:04.769 --> 07:05.839
ROBYN: Communicate with me.

07:05.942 --> 07:06.564
ROBYN [VOICEOVER]:
It's the kitchen.

07:06.667 --> 07:07.565
It's always a new day.

07:07.668 --> 07:09.705
And today is not about me.

07:09.808 --> 07:11.051
Today is about Benjamin.

07:11.154 --> 07:12.742
BENJAMIN: So Barbie, are yougoing to work on the puree,

07:12.846 --> 07:13.950
and you want to
work on the stock--

07:14.054 --> 07:15.158
the mushroom stock?
- Yes.

07:15.262 --> 07:16.643
I haven't worked
with Barbie before.

07:16.746 --> 07:18.023
Barbie, the stock.

07:18.127 --> 07:19.059
Yeah, let's get the stock going.

07:19.162 --> 07:20.301
It's right below you, right?

07:20.405 --> 07:21.751
Sometimes, like, she
seems a little off.

07:21.855 --> 07:23.063
Barbie, we're not
going to need a ton

07:23.166 --> 07:24.409

07:24.513 --> 07:26.584
You want two quarts
of [inaudible]??

07:26.687 --> 07:27.826
No, no, no.

07:27.930 --> 07:29.345
Two quarts of puree.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.037
OK?

07:32.141 --> 07:33.107
Oh, shit.

07:33.211 --> 07:34.177
BENJAMIN [VOICEOVER]:
My strategy

07:34.281 --> 07:35.731
is to treat her with respect.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.215
She doesn't want anybody
talking down to her.

07:37.318 --> 07:41.081
And yeah, I might be the cheffor the night, but in her eyes,

07:41.184 --> 07:42.358
we're kind of equal.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.980
- Too much puree.
- OK.

07:44.084 --> 07:44.947
Yeah, let's do one together.

07:45.050 --> 07:46.396
BARBIE: OK.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.915
BENJAMIN [VOICEOVER]: You know,I learned a lot the last time

07:48.019 --> 07:49.020
I was here, working with Jason.

07:49.123 --> 07:50.573
You know, I worked
my heart out for him.

07:50.677 --> 07:51.816
A gnocchi salad
for two in the fly.

07:52.851 --> 07:53.645
I got it.

07:53.749 --> 07:54.888
A minute and 1/2, Jay.

07:54.991 --> 07:56.372
Jason was always
calm and collected

07:56.476 --> 07:57.718
but never disrespectful.

07:57.822 --> 07:58.857
And that's the same thing.

07:58.961 --> 08:00.169
You know, I want my guys
to know that, you know,

08:00.272 --> 08:01.170
I rely on these guys.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.516
And we got to do it as a team.

08:02.620 --> 08:03.793
It's every one of us tonight.

08:03.897 --> 08:05.485
We better fucking
win, all I'm saying.

08:08.764 --> 08:12.975
Chef, what do you want me toget started working on first?

08:13.078 --> 08:14.390
MICHELLE: [inaudible]
pan and the zucchini.

08:14.494 --> 08:18.221
Nick is basically like
my right hand man.

08:18.325 --> 08:19.706
What if we did
smoked sea salt?

08:19.809 --> 08:20.914
- That would be good.- That would be bomb, right?

08:21.017 --> 08:22.432
- Smoked sea salt caramel.
- Yeah.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.227
You know, I have a
lot of respect and trust

08:24.331 --> 08:25.539
for everything
that he does here.

08:25.643 --> 08:28.956
But I can't say the same
about everyone else.

08:29.060 --> 08:29.923
Elise?

08:30.026 --> 08:30.993
What?

08:31.096 --> 08:32.201
You're filling in
your station, yeah?

08:32.304 --> 08:33.513
What do you see me doing?

08:33.616 --> 08:34.790
Oh, everybody, not just you.Like we all need to--

08:34.893 --> 08:36.723
Well, you said Elise, andthat's exactly what I'm doing.

08:36.826 --> 08:37.827
Elise, just yes or no?

08:37.931 --> 08:39.139
That's all I need to
hear from you all.

08:39.242 --> 08:40.381
OK?

08:40.485 --> 08:40.968
Well, that's what I'mdoing is what I'm saying.

08:41.072 --> 08:41.728
OK, then say yes.

08:41.831 --> 08:42.660
Please.

08:42.763 --> 08:45.007
I'm not saying yes.

08:45.110 --> 08:46.664
MICHELLE [VOICEOVER]:Walking through the station

08:46.767 --> 08:49.494
with Elise, if she wants tohave attitude, that's fine.

08:49.598 --> 08:51.323
I know how to deal with itbecause I've been dealing

08:51.427 --> 08:53.325
with it this entire season.

08:53.429 --> 08:54.706
MICHELLE: You ready, Elise?

08:54.810 --> 08:55.604
Really need to get going.

08:55.707 --> 08:57.813
Just like set up your station.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.090
[sighs]

08:59.193 --> 09:01.195
ELISE [VOICEOVER]: Michellehas this horrible habit

09:01.299 --> 09:05.337
of repeating the same thingover and over and over and over.

09:05.441 --> 09:06.684
Yeah, set up your station.You're good.

09:06.787 --> 09:07.892

Thank you.

09:10.446 --> 09:11.343
[sighs]

09:11.447 --> 09:13.311
You're causing
yourself frustration.

09:13.414 --> 09:14.519
ELISE [VOICEOVER]:
Her voice, for me,

09:14.623 --> 09:16.348
is like nails on a chalkboard.

09:16.452 --> 09:18.627
So I'm just trying
to maintain my sanity

09:18.730 --> 09:19.593
and prep butternut squash.

09:19.697 --> 09:20.801
MICHELLE: I'm just
letting you know,

09:20.905 --> 09:21.802
I'm fixing the sauce for you.

09:21.906 --> 09:22.734
I heard you.

09:22.838 --> 09:23.908
You said that four
times as well.

09:24.011 --> 09:25.495
Elise, shut up.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.876
You shut up.
NICK: Go home.

09:26.980 --> 09:28.533
If you don't like it go home.- You shut up.

09:28.637 --> 09:29.327
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to Michelle.

09:29.430 --> 09:30.293
MICHELLE: No, no.
Y'all--

09:30.397 --> 09:31.571
- I'm talking to Michelle.- No.

09:31.674 --> 09:33.227
NICK: You're rude.
MICHELLE: Stop.

09:33.331 --> 09:34.401
I'm rude?
No, you're rude.

09:34.504 --> 09:35.609
- Are you deaf?- Don't ever tell me to shut up.

09:35.713 --> 09:36.645
Shut up.

09:36.748 --> 09:37.749
ROBYN [VOICEOVER]:
The red team's

09:37.853 --> 09:39.786
not even in dinner
service yet, and already

09:39.889 --> 09:41.408
the bullshit has started.

09:41.511 --> 09:43.583
So we're just basically goingto wait until the red kitchen

09:43.686 --> 09:44.480
like crumbles tonight.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.412
MICHELLE: Did you get this--

09:45.515 --> 09:46.309
Y'all know what rude is?

09:46.413 --> 09:47.207
Because that's how you are.

09:47.310 --> 09:48.173
MICHELLE: Elise, stop please.

09:48.277 --> 09:49.071
Do not engage.

09:49.174 --> 09:50.486
No, you stop.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.419
You're the one causing
the frustration in here.

09:52.522 --> 09:54.594
If you stop micromanagingeveryone doing their jobs

09:54.697 --> 09:56.596
and do yours, you'll probablybe more successful tonight.

09:56.699 --> 09:57.735
MICHELLE: Elise, I don't
need this attitude.

09:57.838 --> 09:58.632
I'm just-- it's
not an attitude.

09:58.736 --> 09:59.426
I don't need it.
Yes, it is.

09:59.529 --> 10:00.358
I don't need your attitude.

10:00.461 --> 10:02.360
I do not need your attitude.

10:02.463 --> 10:03.948
NICK [VOICEOVER]: Elise
really needs to grow up.

10:04.051 --> 10:07.434
She's in her 30s, and she'sacting like a middle-schooler.

10:07.537 --> 10:09.160
Is that an appropriate
thing to do when someone

10:09.263 --> 10:10.402
has a knife in their hand?

10:10.506 --> 10:12.542
Don't act like you've neverhad rubber in your face.

10:12.646 --> 10:13.958
[laughs]

10:14.061 --> 10:15.511
NICK [VOICEOVER]: Frankly,I'm kind of over her

10:15.615 --> 10:16.546
being in the red kitchen.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.547
And I'm definitely
worried she's going

10:17.651 --> 10:19.584
to try and sabotage Michelle.

10:19.688 --> 10:20.585
Well, we're a team here.

10:20.689 --> 10:21.931
We're all looking

18:17.958 --> 18:19.167
So we went up to

But Barbie on apps iskind of a little bit, eh.

18:24.172 --> 18:27.485
BARBIE [VOICEOVER]: Um, I amprobably the least experienced

18:27.589 --> 18:29.625

Shit.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.766
BARBIE [VOICEOVER]: I
worked hot apps once.

18:32.870 --> 18:33.664

Where are the mushroom?

18:37.737 --> 18:38.945
Oh!

18:39.048 --> 18:40.222
I probably should have told him.

18:40.326 --> 18:41.810
[laughs]

18:41.913 --> 18:42.707
And Parmesan.

18:42.811 --> 18:43.984
It needs Parmesan.

18:44.088 --> 18:45.434
More Parmesan.

18:45.538 --> 18:48.023
BENJAMIN: And it needs to becooked a little bit longer too.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.231
But it's good.
OK?

BARBIE [VOICEOVER]: I don't wantto do a bad job for Benjamin.

18:53.408 --> 18:55.927
I know he didn't chooseme, but Ben is treating me

18:56.031 --> 18:58.067
with a lot more
respect than I ever got

18:58.171 --> 18:59.828
from anyone on the red team.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.485
He wasn't the one that
should have went home.

19:01.588 --> 19:02.865
Who do you think
should have went home.

19:02.969 --> 19:05.247
Barbie.

19:05.351 --> 19:08.802
BARBIE: Guess it's a good thingchef didn't think that for us.

19:08.906 --> 19:12.289

19:28.270 --> 19:29.375
MARINO: Chef Michelle?

19:29.478 --> 19:31.411
What's wrong?

19:31.515 --> 19:32.412
Is this the way you want it?

19:32.516 --> 19:33.793
Yes, it's a finishing broth.

19:33.896 --> 19:35.381
It's the same broth
that's in the risotto.

19:35.484 --> 19:37.486
MARINO: They say that it's alittle too watery for them.

19:37.590 --> 19:39.005
OK, I will
replate it for them.

19:39.108 --> 19:40.455
Refire.
Just refire.

19:42.422 --> 19:43.768
Elise, can you
refire two risotto?

19:43.872 --> 19:45.045
It's not your fault.
They just didn't

19:45.149 --> 19:46.323
like the broth around it.

19:46.426 --> 19:48.187
Can you get rid of these for me?

19:48.290 --> 19:50.223
MICHELLE [VOICEOVER]: There weretwo guests in the dining room

19:50.327 --> 19:51.880
that weren't appreciativeof the broth.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.640
So if they don't want thebroth on it, that's fine.

19:53.744 --> 19:55.332
I'll refire it, and
I won't put any on.

19:55.435 --> 19:57.989

20:18.631 --> 20:19.942
MILLY [VOICEOVER]:
Being able to work

20:20.046 --> 20:24.119
with somebody like Elise, that'swhere you show you're a leader.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.500
Get 'em, Michelle!

20:25.603 --> 20:26.915

How really long?
Come on.

22:41.705 --> 22:42.499

No way.

22:44.224 --> 22:45.087

22:49.609 --> 22:51.370
I'm gonna prove to ChefRamsay that I can bounce back.

22:51.473 --> 22:53.613
Whatever my brigade does,
no matter what happens,

22:53.717 --> 22:54.959
I'm going to push,

Very nice, Jennifer.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.039

23:06.143 --> 23:08.214
You know, that saying that youlearn more from your failures

23:08.317 --> 23:09.457
than you learn from
your successes.

23:09.560 --> 23:10.699
That's true.
Jennifer, come on.

23:10.803 --> 23:11.597

I got four chickens all day?

23:16.912 --> 23:17.913
Ask Nick, I'm clean right now.

23:18.017 --> 23:19.777
MILLY: Oh, check, Nick.

23:19.881 --> 23:21.952

23:32.756 --> 23:33.964
Shit.

23:34.067 --> 23:35.759
Huh?
What you just say?

23:35.862 --> 23:36.691
We're not doing a nine-top.

23:36.794 --> 23:37.761
Hey.

23:37.864 --> 23:38.900
Hey, I know it's not
my kitchen, but I

23:39.003 --> 23:39.935
am going to tell you something.

23:40.039 --> 23:41.523
We're not doing a
fucking nine-top.

23:41.627 --> 23:42.455
OK.

23:42.559 --> 23:43.698
MILLY [VOICEOVER]:
Come on, Nick.

23:43.801 --> 23:46.114
When have you ever heardChef Ramsay call a nine-top.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.287

23:47.391 --> 23:48.634
I'm just telling you.
I'm calling it as it is.

23:48.737 --> 23:50.049
No, yeah.

23:50.152 --> 23:50.877
She's not going to tell you,but I'm going to fucking step

23:50.981 --> 23:51.706
in and tell you.
- No, yes.

23:51.809 --> 23:53.052
GORDON: We not doing a nine-top.

23:53.155 --> 23:54.398

So you can throw allthat like a fucking buffet.

23:57.021 --> 23:58.540
Congratulations, Benjamin.

24:03.027 --> 24:04.097
MILLY: Yes, chef.

24:04.201 --> 24:05.513
But let me tell you,
the quality's not there.

24:05.616 --> 24:06.893
And me standing
around shouting out,

24:06.997 --> 24:09.413
three salmon, three New Yorkstrip, a six-top, a nine-top.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.415
You've seen how hard wework to get a six-top out.

24:11.519 --> 24:12.589
Yes, chef.

24:12.692 --> 24:14.038
We're not going tothrow food out a nine-top.

24:14.142 --> 24:15.488
MICHELLE: I wasn't
going to, chef.

24:15.592 --> 24:16.903
MICHELLE [VOICEOVER]:
We all make mistakes.

24:17.007 --> 24:18.905
Just because Nick
called out a ticket

24:19.009 --> 24:20.182
that wasn't on
fire, doesn't mean

24:20.286 --> 24:21.943
I'm not in control
of the kitchen.

24:22.046 --> 24:22.806
Is that what you want?

24:22.909 --> 24:23.738
No, I was--

24:23.841 --> 24:24.773
No, he's firing it.

My apologies, chef.

24:27.776 --> 24:29.709

24:29.813 --> 24:30.745
News flash, Nick.

24:30.848 --> 24:32.367

24:32.471 --> 24:34.680
It's not you today.

24:34.783 --> 24:35.991
OK, yo.

24:36.095 --> 24:37.406
Let's stop, sell this table,regroup, and we'll go on.

24:46.450 --> 24:47.762
Yes, chef.

24:47.865 --> 24:49.349
Ain't playing today, guys.

24:49.453 --> 24:51.559
I feel pretty confidentbeing on this meat station.

24:51.662 --> 24:53.319
You know, in order to
get my black jacket,

24:53.422 --> 24:54.251
I cooked the lamb loin.

24:54.354 --> 24:56.495
And I'm confident
cooking fillets.

24:56.598 --> 24:58.151
Chef, I got a two fillets.

24:58.255 --> 24:59.394
I'm slicing your
lamb right now, chef.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.569
BENJAMIN: Thank you.

25:01.672 --> 25:02.949
Just touch that.
It's way under.

25:03.053 --> 25:04.088
Yep.

25:04.192 --> 25:05.745
Robyn, I need this filet
a little bit longer.

25:05.849 --> 25:07.402
It's rare.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.817
Yes, chef.

25:08.921 --> 25:10.198
How are you doing, Robyn?

25:10.301 --> 25:11.648
I'm not happy.

25:11.751 --> 25:14.374
Robyn, talks a big game abouthow she can cook some meat.

25:14.478 --> 25:17.170
And then next thing you know,she's sending up raw meat.

25:17.274 --> 25:18.724
She's cray cray.

25:18.827 --> 25:20.795
Oh, my fucking God.

25:20.898 --> 25:22.935
He thinks we're
fucking fucking him.

25:23.038 --> 25:24.592
Cray cray.

25:24.695 --> 25:25.731
Robyn, keep the pan hot.

25:25.834 --> 25:27.353
The water has to be frothy.

25:27.456 --> 25:28.527
Rissole, rissole, rissole!

25:28.630 --> 25:29.700
Keep basting it.

25:29.804 --> 25:30.839
OK?

25:30.943 --> 25:32.427
GORDON: Hey, check the fillets.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.809
They look scorched.

25:34.912 --> 25:37.259
I'm good.

25:37.363 --> 25:38.882
These are too--
they're too burnt.

25:38.985 --> 25:40.469
They're charred.
That's how it's coming--

25:40.573 --> 25:42.023
No, you've got to cook
them on a lower flame.

25:42.126 --> 25:43.403
Do you have more going?
ROBYN: Yeah.

25:43.507 --> 25:45.129
Can I walk?

25:45.233 --> 25:46.096
No?

25:46.199 --> 25:48.408
How long for
table one, please?

25:48.512 --> 25:49.306
How long for one?

25:49.409 --> 25:50.963
How long table one?

25:51.066 --> 25:52.620
How long on the beef, Robyn?

25:52.723 --> 25:55.277
I have five minutes.

25:55.381 --> 25:56.624
VAN [VOICEOVER]:
Where's the meat, Robyn?

25:56.727 --> 25:58.280
This is the wrong
dinner service be slow.

25:58.384 --> 25:59.419
This is the finale.

25:59.523 --> 26:00.489
This all-stars.

26:00.593 --> 26:01.387
Hey, come here.

26:01.490 --> 26:02.353
Yes, chef.

26:02.457 --> 26:03.285
It's not the standard.

26:03.389 --> 26:04.701
She's absolutely
fucking flatlined.

26:04.804 --> 26:06.219
When she starts making
you look bad like that,

26:06.323 --> 26:07.117
I'm going to intervene.

26:07.220 --> 26:08.083
So come on.

26:08.187 --> 26:08.981
Come on, Robyn!

26:09.084 --> 26:10.016
Fight back!

26:10.120 --> 26:11.949
Robyn, you need anything?

26:12.053 --> 26:13.882
A Valium.

26:13.986 --> 26:15.643
I don't do drugs.

26:15.746 --> 26:17.023

26:17.127 --> 26:18.646
ROBYN: [SINGING] Ay, dios mio.

26:18.749 --> 26:21.131
I don't even fucking knowwhat we're doing right now.

26:21.234 --> 26:22.719
BARBIE [VOICEOVER]: It's
always unfortunate when

26:22.822 --> 26:24.652
you have to let someone go.

26:24.755 --> 26:28.414
But unfortunately, Robyn needsto step away from the meat.

26:28.517 --> 26:29.484
Robyn, how long?

26:29.588 --> 26:30.623
I could--
I'm ready.

26:30.727 --> 26:31.210
BENJAMIN: You're working?OK.

26:35.145 --> 26:36.836
Young lady, touch the beef.

26:36.940 --> 26:37.803
Touch it.

26:37.906 --> 26:39.701
Now tell me, go on.

26:39.805 --> 26:40.668
ROBYN: It's under, chef.

26:40.771 --> 26:41.807
You know it is.

26:41.910 --> 26:42.704
Yes, chef.

26:42.808 --> 26:44.810
So you sabotaged him?

26:44.913 --> 26:45.707
ROBYN: [ANGRILY] No, chef!

26:45.811 --> 26:47.675
I would never sabotage him!

26:47.778 --> 26:49.193
It was a fuck-up, chef!

26:49.297 --> 26:50.091
Oh, really?

26:50.194 --> 26:51.333
Yes, chef!

26:51.437 --> 26:52.300
I don't want to fuck him.

26:52.403 --> 26:53.301
I'm not here to sabotage him.

26:53.404 --> 26:54.198
Right.

26:54.302 --> 26:55.372
You don't care.

26:55.475 --> 26:56.511
Oh, my God.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.926
I'm not going to answer
any more questions.

26:58.030 --> 26:59.065
Why not?

26:59.169 --> 27:00.860
Because everything
I say is wrong, chef.

27:00.964 --> 27:03.104
GORDON: Oh, so what
you did was right?

27:03.207 --> 27:04.795

27:12.285 --> 27:13.286
How long on fillets?

27:13.390 --> 27:14.736
BENJAMIN: How long

27:14.840 --> 27:15.703
Just get them hot.

27:15.806 --> 27:17.152
I'm getting hot.
BENJAMIN: OK?

27:17.256 --> 27:19.430
BENJAMIN [VOICEOVER]: So thething is, if I yelled at Robyn,

27:19.534 --> 27:20.777
she would have imploded.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.330
She doesn't handle
that well, and I did

27:22.433 --> 27:24.056
not want Robyn to fall apart.

27:24.159 --> 27:25.644
I need Robyn to bounce back.

27:25.747 --> 27:27.128
I got two different feels.

27:27.231 --> 27:28.060
This one was the one.

27:28.163 --> 27:29.302
I think--

27:29.406 --> 27:30.649
- That one's good.
- OK, that's--

27:30.752 --> 27:31.650
This one needs to go
a little bit longer.

27:31.753 --> 27:32.547
Get these going right now.

27:35.136 --> 27:36.275

27:53.948 --> 27:55.397

27:55.501 --> 27:56.640
You don't want to

for making it into the finale.

32:35.884 --> 32:37.679
I got further than
I did in season 14.

32:37.783 --> 32:39.750
And I wish Benjamin
the best of luck.

32:39.854 --> 32:40.924
He was a great competitor.

32:41.028 --> 32:43.133
He really brought
it and challenged me

32:43.237 --> 32:44.514
a lot here in Hell's Kitchen.

32:44.617 --> 32:45.894
Eat all the vegetables too.

33:01.634 --> 33:02.601
kept pushing.

33:02.704 --> 33:03.982
Hopefully, chef
thinks it's enough.

33:04.085 --> 33:05.811
He's the only person that knows.

33:05.914 --> 33:07.606
Like I can't get into
his brain, you know.

33:07.709 --> 33:09.815
I wish I could because thenI'd be much smarter but--

[music playing]

33:14.337 --> 33:15.614
