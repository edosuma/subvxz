00:02.060 --> 00:04.624
It looks like Austin is going with...

00:05.332 --> 00:06.748
...an astronaut.

00:07.131 --> 00:09.705
And Kelly's drawing a police officer.

00:13.063 --> 00:16.224
I'm not sure "elephant" counts as a job, Laurence.

00:24.557 --> 00:25.896
What about you, Sydney?

00:27.487 --> 00:29.104
Are you having trouble getting started?

00:31.095 --> 00:32.137
That's okay.

00:32.424 --> 00:33.545
I can help you.

00:34.734 --> 00:38.192
I want you to close your eyes and tell me the very first thing

00:38.197 --> 00:40.771
that pops into your mind when I ask you this question:

00:41.800 --> 00:43.526
What do you want to be when you grow up?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.017 --> 01:04.675
I just spoke with Zurich. Sloane hit the twelve. They're all dead.

01:04.677 --> 01:06.703
- He's solidifying power.
- I must contact Sydney.

01:06.707 --> 01:07.751
Get Marshall and Rachel.

01:07.758 --> 01:09.512
We'll rendezvous at Mikro storage.

01:09.727 --> 01:10.720
Trust no one else.

01:14.627 --> 01:15.662
<i>You'll be all right.</i>

01:15.748 --> 01:16.913
Rachel, we have to leave.

01:19.588 --> 01:21.923
We don't have time to mourn right now.

01:55.987 --> 01:58.011
One, two... three.

01:58.626 --> 01:59.971
Come on! Come on!

02:02.817 --> 02:05.273
One, two, three...

02:06.206 --> 02:07.860
Come on! You're stronger than this!

02:21.705 --> 02:22.720
Excuse me.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.200
Something's happened.

02:38.128 --> 02:39.860
Your mother was in an accident.

02:41.735 --> 02:43.913
Her car skidded off the road, and...

02:47.316 --> 02:48.450
She's gone.

02:51.155 --> 02:52.161
Your mother...

02:53.855 --> 02:55.170
She's dead.

02:58.566 --> 03:00.643
sweetheart, I need you to be strong right now.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.492
I need you to be... strong.

03:14.776 --> 03:16.391
It's okay. You're okay.

03:21.176 --> 03:22.652
Everything's gonna be okay.

03:32.416 --> 03:34.700
I saw the news reports on Los Angeles.

03:34.905 --> 03:35.902
Good work.

03:35.946 --> 03:38.621
I'm not certain "good" is the proper word for it, but thank you.

03:38.825 --> 03:41.681
I've dispatched a team to the location you acquired at Mt. Subasio.

03:41.895 --> 03:44.273
I want to be airborne as soon as they find something.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.361
Understood.

03:46.247 --> 03:48.652
Were you able to make contact with our friend in Hong Kong?

03:48.656 --> 03:50.420
Yes. She sends her regards.

04:00.275 --> 04:02.102
Should I tell her we have a deal?

04:06.426 --> 04:09.443
Let her know the transports will leave just as soon as they're ready.

04:12.688 --> 04:15.240
Am I to understand that we're still going through with this?

04:15.658 --> 04:17.721
Don't tell me you're having second thoughts.

04:18.136 --> 04:19.161
Of course not.

04:20.298 --> 04:23.730
It's just it's not every dayone gets to be a part of global genocide.

04:27.437 --> 04:30.503
If I can get a signal down here, I may be able to tap into Langley's network.

04:30.508 --> 04:32.903
I can spoof the origin. They won't be able to trace the hack.

04:32.907 --> 04:35.231
Sloane will try to seize control of Prophet 5's operations

04:35.237 --> 04:36.693
as quickly as possible.

04:36.697 --> 04:40.172
We should look to identify any unusual activity in their holdings.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.350
It's me. We're in Siena.

04:44.788 --> 04:46.120
<i>So Sydney is with you?</i>

04:46.508 --> 04:47.950
<i>Yeah. We're both okay.</i>

04:49.065 --> 04:50.233
Thank God.

04:51.706 --> 04:53.460
We've had a situation here.

04:53.725 --> 04:55.770
Homebase has been compromised.

04:56.658 --> 04:58.242
<i>Tom... didn't make it.</i>

05:01.036 --> 05:02.830
<i>Stay at the safe house. Once we gather</i>

05:02.845 --> 05:05.090
<i>some more information, we'll forward it to you there.</i>

05:05.375 --> 05:06.381
Got it.

05:08.278 --> 05:09.310
How is she?

05:12.298 --> 05:14.333
She took a pretty big hit, but she'll bounce back.

06:07.586 --> 06:08.582
Dad?

06:09.047 --> 06:10.042
You did this?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.562
Can you show me how you did it?

06:48.326 --> 06:50.140
- What?
- It's a test,

06:51.336 --> 06:52.592
called an "indicator".

06:53.595 --> 06:55.291
People in my line of work use it

06:55.298 --> 06:58.170
to identify people with a highly developed sense

06:58.576 --> 07:00.061
of 3-dimensional reasoning.

07:00.928 --> 07:03.260
Very few people can do it. I can't do it.

07:03.587 --> 07:04.600
You can't?

07:06.626 --> 07:07.931
What it means, Sydney, is...

07:10.896 --> 07:12.641
You are a very special...

07:13.036 --> 07:14.050
...girl.

07:28.295 --> 07:29.420
Twelve hours ago,

07:29.426 --> 07:31.361
two intercontinental cruise missiles were stolen

07:31.365 --> 07:33.202
from a storage facility in Moscow.

07:33.428 --> 07:34.513
We think it's Sloane?

07:34.748 --> 07:36.271
Whatever he's up to,

07:36.966 --> 07:38.722
he said it was too late to be stopped.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.070
He also said that he'd wipe out everyone at A.P.O.

07:41.267 --> 07:42.311
He was wrong.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.433
Still, how can we find him?

07:45.267 --> 07:46.320
It's impossible.

07:47.386 --> 07:49.011
We don't have a single lead.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.420
- We can't trust the C.I.A.
- Sydney, stop, alright?

07:52.427 --> 07:55.271
Let's not overlook the fact that you basically died today.

07:55.378 --> 07:57.412
You and I have gotten pretty good at impossible.

07:59.577 --> 08:01.193
I'm gonna have to deal with this wound.

08:01.197 --> 08:03.032
I don't have any anesthetic. It's gonna hurt.

08:07.856 --> 08:09.002
Just hold still.

08:13.917 --> 08:14.921
Sorry.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.773
Why would Sloane steal the missiles?

08:20.756 --> 08:23.440
- What?
- He just wiped out the Twelve, right?

08:23.587 --> 08:26.601
Which means that he controls their assets.

08:27.635 --> 08:29.440
He wouldn't steal missiles.

08:29.446 --> 08:31.790
He'd just buy them on the black market.

08:32.496 --> 08:34.000
I think I know how to find him.

08:35.575 --> 08:36.830
We start with the money.

08:41.705 --> 08:44.903
<i>If  we can hack into the system, we can I.D. who the payoffs went to.</i>

08:49.417 --> 08:51.412
<i>Then all we need are phone records.</i>

08:54.445 --> 08:56.860
<i>If  I'm right, they'll lead us right to Sloane...</i>

09:00.466 --> 09:02.980
<i>Or at least, someone he's been working with.</i>

09:28.435 --> 09:30.620
We know you're working with Arvin Sloane,

09:31.455 --> 09:34.201
and we know about the I.C.B.M.S he's recently acquired.

09:34.205 --> 09:36.110
What we don't know is where they are

09:36.276 --> 09:37.552
or where they're headed.

09:38.146 --> 09:40.051
Now I'm well aware that you're tough,

09:40.318 --> 09:42.990
that you've been conditioned to withstand torture.

09:44.577 --> 09:46.272
But I have something you don't have.

09:48.096 --> 09:49.882
I have your former best friend.

09:51.408 --> 09:53.152
And I know what you're afraid of.

10:01.916 --> 10:04.882
If I were you, I would stay extremely still.

10:08.196 --> 10:09.913
She has no idea where those missiles are.

10:09.915 --> 10:11.361
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

10:11.396 --> 10:14.350
What she does know: Sloane is planning to target two cities

10:14.367 --> 10:16.241
with high civilian concentrations.

10:16.486 --> 10:18.073
He's not interested in the devastation.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.862
He plans to profit off the reconstruction.

10:19.965 --> 10:22.402
Sloane controls Prophet 5's network,

10:22.406 --> 10:25.013
communications,  pharmaceuticals, finance, he'll make billions.

10:25.216 --> 10:26.251
It gets worse.

10:27.117 --> 10:28.620
Sloane's in Mongolia.

11:07.827 --> 11:10.501
Put on your dancing shoes. We are going out tonight.

11:11.146 --> 11:12.220
I can't tonight.

11:12.278 --> 11:13.820
"Can't" is not an option.

11:14.065 --> 11:16.970
Charlie got us passes for that new club in Silverlake.

11:17.217 --> 11:19.332
That job fair is tonight. I really wanna go.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.060
Job fair? What? Syd.

11:21.675 --> 11:24.140
You have four years to figure out what kind of job you want.

11:24.175 --> 11:26.083
I just had a meeting with my advisor,

11:26.088 --> 11:28.380
and she yelled at me 'cause I haven't picked a major yet.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.651
Education. Done.

11:30.146 --> 11:31.552
You can be a teacher like your mom.

11:31.557 --> 11:33.702
I mean, you always talked about how happy she was.

11:33.756 --> 11:34.921
I thought about that,

11:34.926 --> 11:37.211
but I've always thought about teaching as my safety net.

11:37.216 --> 11:38.600
Teaching's no safety net.

11:38.645 --> 11:40.501
You know how dangerous it is to be a teacher?

11:40.610 --> 11:42.356
Kids bring knives to school these days.

11:42.417 --> 11:44.775
I hate the thought that I could make a decision now

11:44.847 --> 11:46.543
that would affect the rest of my life.

11:46.695 --> 11:48.401
Well, I say go with education.

11:50.316 --> 11:52.371
Charlie is bringing a friend tonight,

11:52.565 --> 11:54.021
Danny something.

11:55.175 --> 11:57.633
- We'll pick you up at 8:00.
- I'll see you later.

12:04.477 --> 12:06.472
I was hoping I might have a moment of your time.

12:21.858 --> 12:23.291
Tell Dixon we'll touch base

12:23.297 --> 12:25.121
as soon as we cross into Mongolian airspace.

12:25.126 --> 12:27.010
Marshall and I are gonna hack into the N.R.O.,

12:27.015 --> 12:28.760
See if we can use their optical satellites

12:28.766 --> 12:29.743
to locate the missiles.

12:31.566 --> 12:32.671
Rachel, listen.

12:32.868 --> 12:34.053
Prophet 5 is gone.

12:34.408 --> 12:37.680
Your family is no longer in danger. You don't have to do this anymore.

12:38.938 --> 12:41.950
People have given their lives for this. I'm not gonna bail on them now.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.320
I'm in this until it's over.

12:45.767 --> 12:47.371
Of course, if we don't find Sloane,

12:47.506 --> 12:49.270
that may not be very long from now.

13:00.785 --> 13:02.373
Did it have to be so filthy?

13:03.216 --> 13:05.481
I mean, really, if Rambaldi can prophesize the future,

13:05.485 --> 13:08.001
he might have advised me not to wear $500 shoes.

13:21.398 --> 13:22.780
Structural imaging shows

13:22.788 --> 13:25.410
that there's a chamber about 200 feet below us.

13:26.746 --> 13:27.801
That's quite a climb.

13:28.666 --> 13:29.940
You needn't worry.

13:31.225 --> 13:33.301
The next step is for me alone.

14:44.178 --> 14:45.193
At last,

14:46.267 --> 14:47.843
after almost 30 years.

14:49.898 --> 14:51.631
Is it everything you imagined?

14:53.465 --> 14:55.042
I'm so glad you're here.

14:55.326 --> 14:57.281
If I didn't have someone to share this with,

14:57.285 --> 14:58.682
I may have doubted my own eyes.

14:58.895 --> 15:00.900
You're talking to your dead daughter.

15:01.478 --> 15:03.793
This is an odd time to question your sanity.

15:04.275 --> 15:05.291
Perhaps.

16:04.448 --> 16:05.750
So that's it?

16:06.457 --> 16:08.842
All this time, that's what you wanted.

16:09.445 --> 16:10.712
This, sweetheart,

16:11.076 --> 16:13.912
this is what everybody has always wanted.

16:15.127 --> 16:16.403
And I've found it.

16:19.567 --> 16:20.772
It's over, Sloane.

16:26.717 --> 16:28.291
Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Vaughn,

16:29.048 --> 16:30.603
but aren't you supposed to be dead?

16:32.665 --> 16:34.312
I suppose we'll have to rectify that.

16:41.808 --> 16:42.812
Well, then,

16:43.307 --> 16:44.782
it appears we have a predicament.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.451
Don't move.

16:58.627 --> 17:00.190
No! Sydney, don't.

17:10.965 --> 17:11.880
What is this, Sloane?

17:11.887 --> 17:13.301
Sydney, please don't be rash.

17:13.436 --> 17:15.862
Give me one reason why I shouldn't destroy this right now.

17:15.915 --> 17:18.431
Suppose I were to give you two good reasons.

17:26.766 --> 17:28.890
He's gonna strike the U.S. Can you purge the virus?

17:28.897 --> 17:31.533
No, not from here. But I did pinpoint the origin.

17:32.366 --> 17:33.993
Someone uploaded it from Hong Kong.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.042
Who's in Hong Kong?

17:41.075 --> 17:42.302
Who are you protecting?

17:44.316 --> 17:45.631
Should I get the snake?

17:46.435 --> 17:47.431
Don't.

17:52.377 --> 17:54.322
Sloane had to call in a partner.

17:56.126 --> 17:58.103
He needed something he didn't have.

17:58.428 --> 17:59.960
What's that?

18:02.128 --> 18:03.660
Hand me the sphere, Sydney.

18:05.447 --> 18:06.952
I'll let you all walk out of here.

18:08.056 --> 18:09.740
I won't insult you with pretense, Sydney.

18:09.745 --> 18:11.402
We know each other too well for that.

18:13.776 --> 18:15.620
Oh, I know you're trying to figure a way out.

18:15.626 --> 18:19.032
Just hand over the sphere, and I will let you all walk away.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.660
If I give this to you,

18:23.698 --> 18:25.630
what's to guarantee you won't shoot us anyway?

18:25.685 --> 18:28.063
Despite what you may think, I'm not heartless.

18:29.247 --> 18:30.971
Come on, take my offer.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.561
It appears that Vaughn is back.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.222
Go. Be a family.

18:37.335 --> 18:39.400
Frankly, I don't think you have any other option.

18:39.407 --> 18:42.301
If you want this, we'll walk out of here together, and then we'll talk.

18:44.508 --> 18:46.191
Well, remember, Sydney, it's your choice.

18:49.698 --> 18:50.700
Dad!

18:51.737 --> 18:52.741
Dad!

19:22.238 --> 19:23.852
Dad? Dad?

19:25.005 --> 19:26.003
Dad? Are you home?

19:26.636 --> 19:29.892
That's  right, they're having problems with their tail rudder controls.

19:30.246 --> 19:32.600
Yeah. Okay, well, I'll get back to you.

19:34.327 --> 19:35.263
Hello, Sydney.

19:40.415 --> 19:41.500
What's this?

19:41.926 --> 19:42.921
Open it.

19:45.745 --> 19:47.162
You've been paying my tuition.

19:47.307 --> 19:48.950
I thought I should at least help out.

19:49.705 --> 19:51.061
What'd you do, rob a bank?

19:51.426 --> 19:52.431
Sort of.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.423
I got a job at a bank.

19:55.168 --> 19:57.652
It's just part-time for now, at least. It's...

19:57.978 --> 20:00.032
It's, a French bank. It's called Crédit Dauphine.

20:00.176 --> 20:02.191
They have a very international clientele.

20:04.235 --> 20:05.711
Crédit Dauphine?

20:06.065 --> 20:08.451
Yeah, they have 12 branches around the world.

20:08.848 --> 20:10.162
You're already working there?

20:10.636 --> 20:11.640
About a month.

20:12.075 --> 20:14.630
I wanted to make sure it would work out before I told you.

20:14.985 --> 20:16.811
A month. Good. It's not too late to quit.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.811
- What?
- Sydney, listen to me.

20:18.827 --> 20:21.221
I'm not quitting this job. I like it. I'm good at it.

20:21.256 --> 20:22.981
I imagine you are. That's not the point.

20:23.157 --> 20:24.713
What is the point?

20:24.927 --> 20:27.471
- God, if mom were here, she...
- If your mother was here...

20:31.358 --> 20:32.710
If your mother was here,

20:33.616 --> 20:35.332
she would want you to focus

20:35.518 --> 20:37.881
on school, which is what you're going to do.

20:43.446 --> 20:44.932
I didn't come to ask your permission.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.792
- I've already made my decision.
- This is not your decision to make.

20:55.557 --> 20:56.620
Sydney, come back...

21:07.286 --> 21:08.610
- Right here.
- All right, Syd.

21:08.716 --> 21:09.853
You're okay, you're okay.

21:15.168 --> 21:17.040
It's okay. I'm gonna go call for help, okay?

21:19.056 --> 21:21.171
Okay, just be still. Look, you're gonna be okay.

21:23.005 --> 21:24.550
We have a problem. Jack's been shot.

21:24.717 --> 21:25.990
<i>- How bad?
- It's critical.</i>

21:25.996 --> 21:27.013
<i>We need air support.</i>

21:28.066 --> 21:29.991
Contact Salim Behari in Ulaanbaatar.

21:30.147 --> 21:32.443
Have him send a medevac unit. Tell them to hurry.

21:35.356 --> 21:36.911
Dad, keep talking to me.

21:37.345 --> 21:38.871
I'm doing fine. It's...

21:39.227 --> 21:40.081
It's just...

21:40.978 --> 21:42.133
It's just a scratch.

21:44.527 --> 21:45.831
I'm just gonna take a look.

21:51.187 --> 21:52.412
You're gonna be okay.

21:54.037 --> 21:55.911
Chopper's on its way. Should be a half-hour.

21:55.988 --> 21:57.161
<i>- Did you hear that?
- Yeah</i>

21:57.268 --> 21:58.192
<i>Listen.</i>

21:58.198 --> 21:59.603
Sloane's  dead, Sark got away.

21:59.667 --> 22:01.040
<i>He's got the artifact.</i>

22:01.215 --> 22:02.573
I think we know where he's going.

22:04.397 --> 22:05.462
Sorry.

22:06.055 --> 22:07.051
Sorry.

22:07.687 --> 22:09.291
Medevac's on its way. How's he doing?

22:10.166 --> 22:11.382
His heart rate's up.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.540
I think the bullet penetrated his lung. He's not getting enough air.

22:16.486 --> 22:17.730
Sloane has a partner.

22:18.937 --> 22:20.231
We know who's behind this.

22:23.606 --> 22:24.821
<i>I have the artifact.</i>

22:25.106 --> 22:26.121
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

22:26.376 --> 22:27.372
Good.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.280
See that it gets here intact.

22:34.966 --> 22:35.980
Listen to me.

22:37.555 --> 22:39.102
Dad, you have been shot in the chest.

22:39.105 --> 22:40.770
The medical team is on their way. You...

22:40.856 --> 22:42.550
I can't risk moving you. Right? I can't...

22:42.557 --> 22:43.471
Vaughn,

22:44.305 --> 22:46.092
get the transport ready.

22:47.806 --> 22:48.853
Wait, Vaughn...

22:49.487 --> 22:50.710
Wait, Vaughn, wait!

22:51.256 --> 22:52.401
Dad, what are you doing?

22:52.405 --> 22:53.350
You can't go anywhere.

22:53.365 --> 22:56.950
Sydney, your mother's not the type to make empty threats.

22:57.325 --> 22:59.000
If she's acquired missiles,

22:59.888 --> 23:01.340
she intends to use them.

23:01.768 --> 23:04.841
You can't even stand up straight. How do you expect to confront mom?

23:06.537 --> 23:07.903
I'm not coming with you.

23:11.978 --> 23:14.431
You have to go to Hong Kong. There's no other way.

23:17.757 --> 23:19.211
I am not leaving you here.

23:19.478 --> 23:20.570
You're the only one

23:21.206 --> 23:22.943
who can get to Irina in time.

23:24.425 --> 23:25.541
You're the only one

23:26.135 --> 23:27.133
who can beat her.

23:28.565 --> 23:29.831
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

23:32.705 --> 23:35.380
I never wanted this life for you, you know.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.801
I never wanted you to bear this kind

23:41.705 --> 23:43.262
of responsibility, but you...

23:45.095 --> 23:46.731
you were a very...

23:47.108 --> 23:48.663
...difficult little girl...

23:50.087 --> 23:51.621
You were far too driven,

23:52.136 --> 23:53.713
far too strong to let someone

23:54.447 --> 23:56.250
like me stop you from becoming

23:56.557 --> 23:57.682
who you are.

23:59.335 --> 24:00.723
Dad, the medical team is coming.

24:00.727 --> 24:04.202
- If you'll just sit tight...
- Sydney, listen to me.

24:04.588 --> 24:05.820
There's no one

24:06.706 --> 24:08.112
in this world

24:09.965 --> 24:12.072
that can do the things that you can do.

24:14.656 --> 24:16.312
I can hold out until help arrives,

24:16.796 --> 24:17.803
but you have to go.

24:18.476 --> 24:19.903
You have to stop your mother.

24:22.876 --> 24:23.862
Okay...

24:25.017 --> 24:26.031
Just...

24:26.695 --> 24:28.160
Okay, good. Just...

24:29.867 --> 24:31.300
Keep applying pressure, please.

24:32.297 --> 24:34.053
You... you can't afford to lose more blood.

24:34.526 --> 24:35.542
Just get moving.

24:39.328 --> 24:40.690
I love you, dad.

24:41.878 --> 24:43.072
I love you, Sydney.

24:45.075 --> 24:47.271
I don't want to leave you.

24:47.355 --> 24:48.362
Go.

25:48.515 --> 25:50.272
Did everything go according to plan?

25:50.285 --> 25:52.263
Your daughter arrived, mucked things up a bit.

25:52.596 --> 25:53.721
Sloane's dead,

25:54.197 --> 25:55.622
and we lost the tomb.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.731
But the artifact's intact.

25:59.068 --> 26:00.843
There's a reason my fees are so high.

26:00.917 --> 26:03.182
Sloane's death doesn't change our agenda.

26:03.477 --> 26:04.802
Contact controls.

26:05.067 --> 26:08.132
As soon as the satellites are down, launch the missile strikes.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.713
Have you decided on the final targets?

26:11.145 --> 26:12.603
Washington and London.

26:14.285 --> 26:15.291
Right away.

26:36.418 --> 26:37.633
What's our status?

26:37.898 --> 26:39.723
<i>Mil-sat one just hit atmosphere.</i>

26:39.725 --> 26:41.682
<i>The rest of the satellites are right behind it.</i>

26:46.278 --> 26:47.400
Initiate the countdown.

26:52.125 --> 26:53.130
Oh, my God.

26:55.787 --> 26:57.013
They've started the launch.

27:02.476 --> 27:03.563
So that's it.

27:03.927 --> 27:05.782
It's the Horizon, isn't it?

27:08.908 --> 27:10.560
You shot the man I loved.

27:11.776 --> 27:13.382
You betrayed my trust.

27:15.928 --> 27:18.511
You risked my daughter's life, all for that.

27:20.315 --> 27:22.062
I don't expect you to understand.

27:23.296 --> 27:24.730
We're very different, Sydney.

27:25.386 --> 27:27.532
You still cling to naive ideals.

27:28.826 --> 27:30.602
I learned, at a very young age,

27:30.976 --> 27:33.693
the only currency worth anything in this world is power.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.513
And the Horizon gives you that?

27:37.648 --> 27:39.792
You've never seen Rambaldi for what he is.

27:41.926 --> 27:44.742
You dismissed his work as the labor of a madman.

27:46.725 --> 27:48.940
You blind yourself to his true potential.

27:51.015 --> 27:53.221
I've spent a lifetime acquiring power.

27:53.877 --> 27:54.883
With this...

27:58.177 --> 27:59.823
And I'll never have to give it up.

28:06.247 --> 28:07.823
Rambaldi  is life, Sydney.

28:12.097 --> 28:13.763
Through him, we can live forever.

28:23.695 --> 28:25.273
I offered you an out.

28:25.638 --> 28:27.210
I gave you your daughter.

28:28.015 --> 28:30.840
I was hoping you'd settle down, leave me to my affairs.

28:31.407 --> 28:33.282
You don't know me very well, do you?

28:33.377 --> 28:34.841
Sadly, I think I do.

28:36.998 --> 28:38.591
After all, I'm still your mother.

28:40.326 --> 28:41.512
That doesn't mean anything.

28:41.978 --> 28:43.013
Not anymore.

28:44.566 --> 28:47.041
I am through being disappointed by you.

28:48.755 --> 28:50.632
I hate that it's come to this.

28:51.537 --> 28:53.052
I suppose it had to.

28:54.946 --> 28:57.972
I've come too far to let anything get in my way.

28:59.646 --> 29:02.130
Then you'll have to go through me first.

29:02.638 --> 29:03.992
You wanted to see me, sir?

29:04.346 --> 29:07.971
I've been reviewing your evaluations since you arrived at SD-6.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.793
To a letter, they're nothing short of exemplary.

29:12.306 --> 29:13.950
I've upgraded your clearance,

29:14.408 --> 29:17.403
and I'm considering promoting you to field officer.

29:18.046 --> 29:19.052
Really?

29:20.195 --> 29:22.561
Now, Sydney, I want to know that you have given this job

29:22.567 --> 29:23.880
its proper consideration.

29:23.955 --> 29:25.692
I realize that you have a romantic notion

29:25.698 --> 29:27.980
of the espionage trade, but this job...

29:28.367 --> 29:31.303
...is more than just brush passes and dead drops.

29:32.656 --> 29:35.652
You will be facing life and death situations on a regular basis.

29:35.657 --> 29:36.842
Do you understand that?

29:36.846 --> 29:38.420
You will be forced to make decisions

29:38.425 --> 29:40.542
that will haunt you for the rest of your life.

29:41.746 --> 29:43.612
This job requires sacrifice,

29:43.966 --> 29:46.741
and you need to know that you are able to live with that.

29:48.285 --> 29:49.530
I can, sir.

29:50.655 --> 29:53.310
For as long as I can remember, I have been searching...

29:53.757 --> 29:55.162
for what I'm supposed to do,

29:55.638 --> 29:57.022
for what I'm supposed to be.

29:58.848 --> 30:00.142
This is my purpose.

30:00.576 --> 30:02.423
It's in my blood.

30:03.967 --> 30:05.311
It's who I am.

30:07.487 --> 30:10.781
I have never been so sure of anything in my life.

31:05.557 --> 31:06.871
Why are you fighting me on this?

31:09.257 --> 31:11.280
The defense satellites are destroyed.

31:17.468 --> 31:19.513
The stars will fall from the sky.

31:22.065 --> 31:24.593
Even if you manage to beat me on this rooftop,

31:25.215 --> 31:27.720
it's still too late to stop the launch.

31:30.418 --> 31:32.203
You think I came here alone?

31:33.557 --> 31:35.841
<i>Sir, beginning final preparations.</i>

31:36.006 --> 31:37.001
Excellent.

31:37.078 --> 31:38.133
Proceed according to...

31:46.178 --> 31:47.631
It appears we have a predicament.

31:59.465 --> 32:00.543
You did it.

32:02.037 --> 32:03.410
You were right all along.

32:06.227 --> 32:08.402
I will never forget your sacrifice.

32:08.567 --> 32:09.702
I promise.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.132
The Horizon is gone.

32:15.378 --> 32:18.923
Your mother is probably dividing up my spoils as we speak.

32:19.376 --> 32:20.791
Then we should get moving.

32:23.796 --> 32:25.730
We don't have to hurry anymore, Nadia.

32:26.386 --> 32:28.422
We have all the time in the world.

32:34.338 --> 32:35.580
Give me the override codes.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.432
I don't have the codes, I swear.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.210
- You shot me!
-Yeah,

32:42.267 --> 32:44.692
and I'll keep shooting until you either give me the codes

32:44.695 --> 32:45.932
or bleed to death. Your choice.

32:47.748 --> 32:50.133
You know, I didn't want any of this.

32:51.175 --> 32:54.631
Mass extermination isn't exactly my passion, Michael.

32:55.597 --> 32:57.200
I'm a businessman.

32:57.798 --> 33:00.642
You know, I simply wanted to come out on the winning end.

33:03.755 --> 33:04.940
I'll give you the codes,

33:05.068 --> 33:06.561
but you have to let me go after I do.

33:06.736 --> 33:08.420
Codes first, then we negotiate.

33:10.888 --> 33:14.392
3-9-8-alpha-4-tango-6-4-7.

33:16.936 --> 33:18.212
Come on. Come on!

33:20.787 --> 33:21.982
Launch aborted!

33:26.946 --> 33:31.402
I'm afraid I can't allow you to be such a complication in my life any longer.

33:35.677 --> 33:37.060
For whatever it's worth,

33:37.757 --> 33:39.072
I truly do love you.

33:55.788 --> 33:57.703
I owe you an apology, Arvin.

33:58.707 --> 34:00.961
I never gave your faith in Rambaldi

34:01.797 --> 34:03.591
the credit it deserved.

34:04.187 --> 34:06.253
There's no need to apologize, Jack.

34:07.035 --> 34:08.263
You're a practical man.

34:08.368 --> 34:09.949
I'd always admired that in you.

34:11.357 --> 34:13.201
Jack, I didn't wanna shoot you.

34:14.277 --> 34:15.940
Sydney forced my hand.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.033
She can be very...

34:19.366 --> 34:21.020
stubborn at times.

34:22.206 --> 34:23.303
You're dying.

34:23.935 --> 34:25.103
I can help you.

34:25.795 --> 34:27.641
I don't want your help, Arvin.

34:29.077 --> 34:30.072
You've...

34:30.888 --> 34:33.902
caused my daughter so much pain.

34:35.358 --> 34:36.900
I could have prevented it.

34:38.538 --> 34:39.532
I won't

34:40.127 --> 34:41.913
continue to make that mistake.

34:43.058 --> 34:45.911
I think you've overestimated your position, Jack.

34:47.338 --> 34:49.033
You can't hurt me anymore.

34:50.146 --> 34:51.141
True.

34:53.697 --> 34:56.681
But I can keep you down here with me.

35:05.805 --> 35:06.960
What are you doing?

35:07.248 --> 35:08.711
You beat death, Arvin.

35:11.228 --> 35:12.852
But you couldn't beat me.

35:19.927 --> 35:21.332
The glass won't hold you.

35:21.567 --> 35:23.490
Mom, you need to come back.

35:31.477 --> 35:32.473
Mom.

35:33.125 --> 35:34.881
You can make it. Give me your hand.

35:37.707 --> 35:38.972
I'm sorry, Sydney.

35:45.166 --> 35:46.491
Mom, come back!

37:02.608 --> 37:03.661
I can't move.

37:08.365 --> 37:10.420
I don't think there's anything I can do.

37:12.936 --> 37:13.970
I can't move.

37:15.056 --> 37:16.062
Well...

37:16.306 --> 37:18.671
as you've said, you have all the time in the world.

37:21.047 --> 37:23.681
Unfortunately, I think you'll have to spend it here.

37:27.728 --> 37:29.723
Well, at least you're here with me.

37:38.608 --> 37:40.250
No, Nadia, don't leave me here.

37:58.868 --> 37:59.933
Daddy!

38:10.398 --> 38:12.203
Uncle Dixon!

38:16.647 --> 38:18.102
How are you, sweetie?

38:19.945 --> 38:21.171
Deputy director.

38:21.217 --> 38:24.422
Please, this far from Langley, you can just call me "sir."

38:25.668 --> 38:26.722
Good to see you.

38:29.545 --> 38:31.311
Did you have a hard time finding this place?

38:31.317 --> 38:32.232
What, are you kidding?

38:32.357 --> 38:34.812
I had an impossible time finding this place.

38:34.948 --> 38:36.920
Well, I guess that's sort of the point, right?

38:39.265 --> 38:40.270
Hello, stranger.

38:40.637 --> 38:42.042
Hello, Sydney.

38:46.186 --> 38:48.361
And this must be...

38:51.588 --> 38:52.642
Hello, Jack.

38:55.168 --> 38:57.710
Marshall sends his best. He wanted to tag along,

38:57.748 --> 38:59.613
but Carrie’s stuck at home on bed rest.

38:59.797 --> 39:02.400
Another baby? Oh, God, I don't know how she does it.

39:02.436 --> 39:04.370
This makes four. All boys.

39:05.098 --> 39:07.763
Well, come on inside. You'll just have to pardon the mess.

39:09.565 --> 39:10.883
Speaking of mess, didn't someone

39:10.898 --> 39:13.110
promise to finish unpacking her toys before dinner?

39:13.387 --> 39:14.191
Go on.

39:14.326 --> 39:15.311
Go on, Isabelle.

39:15.337 --> 39:16.722
Can I get you something to drink?

39:20.875 --> 39:24.200
Why do I get the feeling this isn't a purely social call?

39:28.135 --> 39:30.970
Truth be told, I could use some field assistance.

39:32.845 --> 39:36.380
A merc team hit the national research facility in Paris yesterday.

39:36.778 --> 39:40.413
I need someone to intercept the seller and retrieve the hard drive.

39:41.008 --> 39:42.433
Can't you put Rachel on it?

39:43.408 --> 39:46.620
She's on deep cover assignment in Santiago. I can't risk pulling her.

39:46.695 --> 39:49.080
Besides, this job has...

39:49.376 --> 39:50.842
...sentimental value.

39:58.828 --> 40:00.883
Don't look at me. You're the one that let him go.

40:06.668 --> 40:08.742
We've already prepared the mission specs.

40:08.765 --> 40:10.213
Low risk insertion,

40:10.365 --> 40:11.591
simple areas.

40:11.735 --> 40:13.543
Who knows, it could be fun.

40:14.218 --> 40:16.883
That's what you say every time you show up on my doorstep.

40:17.575 --> 40:20.993
Then next, you know, I'm jumping over canals and tree and shield while Napalm

40:20.995 --> 40:22.401
explodes around me.

40:22.868 --> 40:25.513
Yes. That's how I define "fun".

40:27.438 --> 40:29.593
Why don't we finish this conversation over dinner?

40:30.365 --> 40:32.913
And you haven't lived until you've seen our sunset.

40:38.825 --> 40:40.761
Isabelle, dad and I are going for a walk.

40:53.535 --> 40:55.033
What have you been doing back there?

40:55.035 --> 40:55.923
Nothing, mom.

40:56.305 --> 41:02.440
