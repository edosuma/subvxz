00:01.360 --> 00:04.488
Previously on Elementary:
Ms. Watson...

00:04.530 --> 00:06.236
I'm Mycroft.

00:06.270 --> 00:07.430
Mycroft Holmes.

00:07.470 --> 00:09.233
I'm Sherlock's brother.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.737
What happened
between you two in London?

00:10.770 --> 00:12.408
Oh, my God.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.305
I was in London. I didn't know
he was gonna come here.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.240
You had sex with my brother.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.145
The key is to 2213.

00:18.180 --> 00:21.149
You belong there.
Not me.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.738
There may will come a time
when it is right for me

00:22.790 --> 00:25.441
to return to London
but, uh...

00:25.490 --> 00:27.412
it isn't now.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.257
He's decided to stay.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.655
I'm afraid we're gonna have to
come at the problem

00:34.700 --> 00:36.429
a different way.

00:38.730 --> 00:41.335
So, you know,
if you're asking about

00:41.370 --> 00:44.362
threats to my recovery...

00:44.410 --> 00:46.332
you have to talk about Amy.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.530
(quiet laugh)

00:48.580 --> 00:51.469
It's good to say it
out loud, since...

00:51.510 --> 00:55.173
I'm gonna see her soon
and I should be ready.

00:55.220 --> 00:58.542
You're next.

00:58.590 --> 01:02.629
What's the greatest threat
to your sobriety?

01:02.660 --> 01:05.686
Uh... Sherlock, addict.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.823
ALL:
Hi, Sherlock.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.464
(quiet laugh)

01:11.600 --> 01:15.388
I am without peer.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.432
Without sane peer, anyway...

01:18.470 --> 01:19.505
which is functionally identical

01:19.540 --> 01:21.269
to being without a peer,
full stop.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.519
I can only extend
so much of myself...

01:26.550 --> 01:28.438
to a non-peer.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.643
Which means I can only extend
so much of myself to anyone.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.684
I've made progress,
of course, but...

01:36.730 --> 01:39.756
I don't know how much
more growth there IS Within me.

01:42.630 --> 01:46.464
If I can never value a
relationship properly,

01:46.500 --> 01:48.866
then".

01:48.900 --> 01:52.575
at what point do I
stop trying to maintain them?

01:52.610 --> 01:55.374
You haven't turned your back
on the world yet.

01:58.510 --> 02:02.617
And that's the
greatest threat to my sobriety.

02:02.650 --> 02:06.609
(phone chimes)

02:06.660 --> 02:08.855
(tapping keys)

02:08.890 --> 02:10.482
(woman cries in distance)

02:10.530 --> 02:13.624
(woman sniffs)

02:13.660 --> 02:16.265
(crying, snifﬁng)

02:20.400 --> 02:21.628
Hey.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.501
Uh, do you need to get by?
(sniffling)

02:23.540 --> 02:25.735
Uh, no.
Tess, right?

02:25.770 --> 02:28.534
You, H know you
from the meetings.

02:28.580 --> 02:30.343
(sighs, sniffs)

02:30.380 --> 02:31.642
You okay?

02:31.680 --> 02:34.444
(sighs)
I don't know.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.643
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

02:37.690 --> 02:40.659
It's my sister.

02:40.690 --> 02:43.557
I can't find her.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.555
Hello.
What are you doing here?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.898
Uh, my subway got out at the
time your meeting was finishing,

02:50.930 --> 02:53.490
so I thought we could
walk home together.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.667
All right.
Uh.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.804
Do you remember Tess?

02:57.840 --> 02:59.501
She was really nice to you

02:59.540 --> 03:00.768
when you first started
coming to the meetings.

03:01.710 --> 03:04.543
We're helping her.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.673
Paige is four years
younger than me,

03:06.720 --> 03:08.779
but we got clean
at the same time.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.685
We see each other most days,

03:10.720 --> 03:14.679
but we talk at 9:00 am.
every day, no matter what.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.688
She didn't pick up
her phone today.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.425
I haven't been able
to get her.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.348
I went to her_
apartment, nothing.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.960
And the police don't seem to be
taking it very seriously yet,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.662
but I know that
something's wrong.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.861
Well, you suspect
she might be using again?

03:27.900 --> 03:31.529
I wish I could
say no, but she...

03:31.570 --> 03:34.630
she's been acting weird
for, like, a month.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.944
WATSON:
We're gonna need some raw
information to start with.

03:36.980 --> 03:40.472
Where she lives,
her job, close friends.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.754
You've been quiet the whole
way home. What's up?

03:46.790 --> 03:49.520
Oh, nothing.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.755
Well, it's just...

03:51.790 --> 03:53.951
_ it's not the most_
Interesting case, IS It?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.696
This Paige,
she's an aspiring musician.

03:56.730 --> 03:57.867
She's not the
model of stability.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.595
She's most likely relapsed.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.699
So?

04:01.740 --> 04:03.537
Well, I was hoping to be
without case for a while.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.435
I've been meaning to
run some experiments.

04:05.470 --> 04:06.607
What?

04:06.640 --> 04:07.834
Tess supported you when you

04:07.880 --> 04:09.472
first started speaking
at the meetings.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.649
I think you could take a case
that is beneath you...

04:11.680 --> 04:13.511
if that means
supporting her too.

04:13.550 --> 04:14.710
I never said I wouldn't do it.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.581
What is that smell?

04:22.460 --> 04:24.485
Ms. Hudson,
what's happening here?

04:24.530 --> 04:25.519
Sorry to surprise you.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.653
I was cleaning
and I let him in.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.463
He said I had to
stay for dinner.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.728
He kind of insisted.

04:30.770 --> 04:31.896
He?

04:31.930 --> 04:33.864
MYCROFI':
You're bagkrl Excellent.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.835
Why exactly do you keep a whisk
in your spare bedroom?

04:36.870 --> 04:38.929
Mycroft,
what are you doing here?

04:38.970 --> 04:42.007
I am, as I assume
is apparent, in New York.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.577
I wanted to see my brother!

04:44.610 --> 04:46.441
And my friend.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.912
So, I thought we might
catch up over a bite.

05:00.030 --> 05:01.793
I don't know how long
I'm staying.

05:01.830 --> 05:03.491
(sighs)

05:03.530 --> 05:05.020
The London branch of Diogenes
pretty much runs itself,

05:05.070 --> 05:07.959
but the New York edition's
undergoing some growing pains.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.036
I'd be more useful here.

05:10.070 --> 05:11.935
The truth is, I'm rather
looking forward to

05:11.970 --> 05:13.528
the change of scenery.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.434
I was in a relationship
in London

05:15.480 --> 05:18.643
and it all became
a bit of a cock-up.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.908
Oh, you broke up
with Claudia.

05:19.950 --> 05:21.679
I'm so sorry to hear that.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.017
Well, I'd say,
she was the prime mover.

05:23.050 --> 05:25.814
How do you know the name
of his lover?

05:25.850 --> 05:27.818
We e-mail sometimes.
Mycroft and I are friends.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.088
That's what friends do.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.588
Have you come back here
to sleep with Watson again?
Hello?

05:31.630 --> 05:34.497
As Joan says, we're friends
and friends can spend time

05:34.530 --> 05:35.349
in each other's company

05:35.400 --> 05:37.027
without prurience
rearing its head.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.664
Allow me_demonstra_te_:
Joan, I'm haVIng some difficulty

05:39.700 --> 05:40.860
with my dessert chef
at the restaurant.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.039
I'm auditioning for a new one

05:43.070 --> 05:44.264
tomorrow before
the dinner serVIce.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.574
Would you like to come along,
perhaps venture an opinion?

05:46.610 --> 05:47.508
We're busy tomorrow.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.644
I've just taken on
a very important case.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.500
You may note
that you are not included

05:51.550 --> 05:52.676
intheinvkaﬂon.
Joan?

05:52.720 --> 05:53.846
Sure. It sounds fun.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.472
Good. Good.

06:01.890 --> 06:05.587
Paige Dahl should have invested
in some better locks.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.518
Well, I suppose with some
detailed planning

06:07.560 --> 06:08.629
it could be made to work.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.560
(door closes)

06:10.600 --> 06:11.862
(Watson sighs)

06:11.900 --> 06:13.094
What could be
made to work?

06:13.140 --> 06:15.131
This relationship
with Mycroft.

06:15.170 --> 06:18.003
We could draw up some sort of
shared custody arrangement.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.940
Did you just say,
"shared custody arrangement"?

06:23.980 --> 06:26.744
As in you and Mycroft
sharing custody of me?

06:26.780 --> 06:27.917
There's no need
to be offended.

06:27.950 --> 06:29.747
It's a term of art.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.679
It is a term of,
"never use it again

06:32.720 --> 06:35.018
or I will kick you
in your soft parts."

06:52.010 --> 06:53.534
Hey. Do you recognize this?

06:57.910 --> 06:59.969
So, forget the term,
"shared custody,"

07:00.020 --> 07:03.581
and focus on the concept of
"advanced planning."

07:03.620 --> 07:04.985
(sighs) I don't want to
talk about Mycroft.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.557
In fact, I'm putting
a moratorium on it.

07:07.590 --> 07:09.012
Watson?

07:09.060 --> 07:12.086
I'm serious: moratorium.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.995
I'm quite serious, too.

07:14.030 --> 07:16.123
Tess was right.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.128
_ Her sister's _
Into drugs again.

07:18.170 --> 07:21.094
How much heroin is that?

07:21.140 --> 07:23.802
Oh, it's enough.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.102
I'm fairly certain...

07:25.140 --> 07:27.802
this is _the number
of a delivery serwce.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.671
You call in, you give
them a referral...

07:29.710 --> 07:33.009
and they bring you whatever
illicit drugs you want.

07:33.050 --> 07:34.745
I'm quite familiar
with that concept.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.941
This is not Paige's number...

07:36.990 --> 07:39.140
so, even though she has
a rather large supply of heroin,

07:39.190 --> 07:41.988
I think we can assume that
she's not the entire business.

07:45.860 --> 07:46.929
You're calling them?

07:46.960 --> 07:48.928
Of course. _ _
A young woman IS missmg.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.723
_ Her associates
In the Illegal heronn trade

07:50.770 --> 07:52.965
seem like a good place
to start looking.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.729
We should place an order.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.965
I will liberate one of the bikes
from the rack outside

07:57.010 --> 07:58.966
and follow the delivery man
to his place of origin.

07:59.010 --> 08:01.103
Then we'll have Detective Bell
arrest everyone InSIde

08:01.140 --> 08:03.108
and see who wants
to talk about Paige Dahl.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.975
(whispering):
It's ringing.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.976
MAN:
Hello?

08:09.020 --> 08:11.944
Hi. I got your number
from Paige Dahl.

08:11.990 --> 08:13.116
I would like to
place an order.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.855
All right.
What do you need?

08:14.890 --> 08:16.881
(mouthing)

08:16.930 --> 08:20.058
GREGSON: So you went looking
for a missing person

08:20.100 --> 08:22.989
and you came back with a cell
full of heroin dealers?

08:23.030 --> 08:24.827
We found heroin
from their delivery service

08:24.870 --> 08:26.019
in Paige Dahl's apartment.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.834
We're hoping one of them might
have some idea where she is.

08:28.870 --> 08:31.100
You might have to, uh, convince
the DA to offer leniency

08:31.140 --> 08:32.676
in exchange for
information, of course.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.849
I'm gonna go ahead and let you
take the lead on this one.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.141
So that was your apartment
where we busted

08:43.190 --> 08:45.215
that delivery service?

08:45.250 --> 08:48.083
My name is on the lease.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.020
Was it your business?

08:50.060 --> 08:53.120
Listen, you're looking at
charges whether you talk or not.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.923
The only way you can
help yourself

08:54.960 --> 08:57.121
is if you tell us
where Paige Dahl is.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.228
Paige is missing?

08:58.270 --> 09:01.967
Nobody's seen Paige
in two days now.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.865
You have any idea
why that might be?

09:03.910 --> 09:05.798
No.
That's too bad,

09:05.840 --> 09:08.809
'cause we've got your heroin
and your money in her apartment.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.671
You're saying you think
I had something to do with it?

09:12.180 --> 09:14.114
You say that
she went missing Tuesday.

09:14.150 --> 09:15.913
I was out of town.

09:15.950 --> 09:17.781
I was on a ski trip
with my buddies.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.014
You can ask them.

09:19.050 --> 09:22.110
Or don't. I used my credit card
to pay for the lift tickets.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.821
Oh, very well.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.054
_ Detective Bell
wrll just charge you.

09:25.090 --> 09:26.250
Whoa, wait a minute, man.

09:26.290 --> 09:28.121
I can tell you anything that you
want to know about Paige.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.822
At the moment, all we wish to
learn is where she is.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.934
MYCROFI':
It, it-it doesn't seem like
there's an elegant way

09:35.970 --> 09:40.009
to broach this,
so, blunt will have to do.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.201
I had a...
(clears throat)

09:42.240 --> 09:44.777
a bit of an agenda...
asking you here.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.078
It-it-it's true that Claudia's
back with her ex-husband,

09:49.120 --> 09:51.008
and it's true this restaurant
needs my attention--

09:51.050 --> 09:52.950
they're the reasons
I came back to New York--

09:52.990 --> 09:54.014
but another factor is...

09:54.060 --> 09:55.948
(sighs)

09:55.990 --> 09:57.958
...well, to be blunt, is you.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.094
Me?

10:00.130 --> 10:02.098
I-I-I thought it was a
terrible idea, at first,

10:02.130 --> 10:03.927
so utterly complicated,

10:03.970 --> 10:05.961
but then I realized the reason
I was turning my back

10:06.000 --> 10:07.365
on the possibility
had to do with...

10:07.400 --> 10:11.336
(inhales)
...other parties.

10:11.370 --> 10:14.874
You're a kind,
intelligent woman.

10:14.910 --> 10:17.947
We're two single adults.

10:17.980 --> 10:20.312
We get on.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.989
And I dare say,
the attraction's still there.

10:25.090 --> 10:28.287
Wh-Wh-Why should we
deny ourselves the chance at...

10:29.360 --> 10:32.249
...something...

10:32.290 --> 10:34.258
just because Sherlock
would make it difficult?

10:34.300 --> 10:37.792
"Difficult" may be
an understatement.

10:37.830 --> 10:39.889
I-I'm being as direct
as I possibly can.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.363
I realize there's a chance
this might put you off.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.901
No. I'm not put off.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.362
I, I'm...

10:45.410 --> 10:48.038
I'm so flattered.

10:48.080 --> 10:52.847
I mean, as you said,
it is complicated and-and I...

10:52.880 --> 10:54.074
(sighs)

10:54.120 --> 10:55.872
I'm sorry.
I don't, I don't know

10:55.920 --> 10:57.080
exactly what to say.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.055
You don't have to
say anything right now.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.910
I've given you enough to digest.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.953
Al-Although I do hope
we might revisit the topic.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.291
Yes.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.423
Of course.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.097
Good.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.997
Please, let me.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.234
Oh, thank you.

11:21.210 --> 11:23.804
*

11:27.280 --> 11:29.168
What's up with
the music?

11:29.220 --> 11:32.189
I downloaded the collected works
of Paige Dahl.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.188
Our investigation
into her whereabouts

11:34.220 --> 11:36.017
is otherwise at a standstill.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.028
I'm subjecting myself
to her songs

11:38.060 --> 11:41.223
in the hope that they might spur
some fresh line of thinking.

11:41.260 --> 11:43.922
How was your evening
with Mycroft?

11:43.970 --> 11:45.460
Fun.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.833
You clenched when you said that.
It was practically audible.

11:48.870 --> 11:50.269
What happened?

11:50.310 --> 11:52.266
Nothing happened.

11:52.310 --> 11:54.335
I do not need you
to dissect my every mood.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.076
Good night.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.015
HOLMES:
Did he take liberties
with you?

12:06.250 --> 12:08.957
Your business is your business,
I understand that.

12:08.990 --> 12:10.878
I'm just concerned that you were
lying about your evening

12:10.930 --> 12:13.251
in order to protect Mycroft
from my wrath.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.189
Did he take liberties
with you?

12:16.230 --> 12:18.061
I don't even know
what that means.

12:18.100 --> 12:21.137
And I don't appreciate being
woken up so that you can indulge

12:21.170 --> 12:23.058
your paranoid fantasies
about your brother.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.361
That's not
why I woke you up.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.878
There's a hidden track
at the end of Paige's album.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.878
In it, she refers
to Harriet Tubman

12:28.910 --> 12:31.105
as her constant _
songwriting companion.

12:31.150 --> 12:34.176
Harriet Tubman?
You know, there's a plaque

12:34.220 --> 12:37.246
in Fort Tryon Park
where she once gave a speech.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.246
It's right around the corner
from Paige's apartment.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.952
Her guitar is missing
from her apartment.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.879
I wonder, did she step out
to do a spot of composing?

12:44.930 --> 12:46.352
Worth taking a look, anyway.

12:52.130 --> 12:55.133
Is there anything in particular
we should be looking for?

12:55.170 --> 12:57.400
Anything anomalous.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.973
I suppose if Mycroft
didn't harm you in any way,

13:06.010 --> 13:07.318
I should respect your privacy.

13:07.350 --> 13:10.285
Something tells me that
you're not going to, though.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.288
(Watson sighs)

13:12.320 --> 13:14.151
Look, I didn't tell
you what happened

13:14.190 --> 13:15.509
because A): It's none
of your business

13:15.560 --> 13:18.222
and B): Your reaction
to what happened is bound to be

13:18.260 --> 13:20.319
even more annoying than
your reaction to not knowing.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.294
So it's as I thought.

13:22.330 --> 13:24.423
He made a proposal
of some kind.

13:24.470 --> 13:28.031
(groans)
You're not gonna quit,
are you?

13:28.070 --> 13:31.039
Your brother made
a very sweet, very...

13:31.070 --> 13:33.334
grown-up declaration
of interest.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.338
I didn't respond;
I was surprised.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.201
And because I-I instantly
pictured this...

13:39.250 --> 13:43.516
series of irritating
conversations we had in store.

13:46.290 --> 13:49.282
Are you stunned
into silence?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.558
You think
that's Paige's?

14:03.610 --> 14:06.067
These branches
have been disturbed.

14:06.110 --> 14:08.101
Someone fled
through here.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.439
That's interesting.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.219
Her footprints go this way,

14:19.250 --> 14:22.253
someone also _went
In thIs dIrectIon.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.451
Okay, I'll take left.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.355
All right, look
for footprints, disturbances,

14:26.390 --> 14:28.597
anything that stands out.

14:55.490 --> 14:56.650
HOLMES:
Watson!
I'm over here!

14:56.690 --> 14:59.124
I found the body!

14:59.160 --> 15:01.594
I was gonna say
the same thing!

15:08.570 --> 15:11.130
Who is that?

15:11.170 --> 15:13.570
I have no idea.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.289
It doesn't make any sense.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.288
The murderer pursues
the dead man

15:25.320 --> 15:28.209
to this outcropping;
he tries to hide,

15:28.260 --> 15:30.353
it does him little good, and yet
there are shotgun pellets

15:30.390 --> 15:31.652
on either side
of his hiding place.

15:31.690 --> 15:33.453
Why, if you had your target
in your sights,

15:33.500 --> 15:35.456
would you fire so wildly, hmm?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.468
Maybe the killer
was running?

15:37.500 --> 15:40.264
Have you ever tried to fire
a shotgun while sprinting?

15:40.300 --> 15:43.167
The experience has very little
to recommend it.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.531
Any thoughts on
what happened here?

15:45.570 --> 15:47.128
Whoever pursued Paige

15:47.180 --> 15:49.705
and the dead man
attacked the man first.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.470
After we found his body,
we retraced his steps.

15:52.510 --> 15:54.171
The dead man began fleeing

15:54.220 --> 15:57.109
half a mile before the plaque
of Harriet Tubman.

15:57.150 --> 15:59.710
So he was pursued
before Paige Dahl.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.354
You think he was the target?

16:01.390 --> 16:02.652
WATSON:
We think so.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.487
Paige was probably a witness,
saw what happened,

16:04.530 --> 16:06.088
then got chased down and killed.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.189
If we want to find out
who killed Paige Dahl,

16:08.230 --> 16:10.095
(buzzing)
we need to figure out
who wanted this man dead.

16:12.230 --> 16:13.731
Sorry, I thought
I just saw a mosquito.

16:13.770 --> 16:16.534
It's too early
in the year for mosquitoes.

16:16.570 --> 16:18.458
That's why I mentioned it.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.570
Well, you guys can stop
calling this guy "the dead man."

16:21.610 --> 16:23.544
His name is
Zach Piller.

16:23.580 --> 16:25.468
CSU's done processing
his wallet.

16:25.510 --> 16:27.569
I had a look
at his phone.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.748
Most of his contacts
have a 702 area code.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.258
I'm guessing
he moved here from Vegas.

16:34.790 --> 16:36.451
Mr. Piller has a card from

16:36.490 --> 16:39.527
a Dr. Paul Sutherland,
psychiatrist.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.427
Appointment times on the back.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.519
_ M_r. Piller
Is a CIpher to us.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.526
The doctor may be
a wealth of information.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.538
(sighs)

16:48.570 --> 16:51.539
SUTHERLAND: Zach and I had a
therapist-patient relationship.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.674
What happened?
Who killed him?

16:53.710 --> 16:56.338
Actually, we were hoping
you could help us with that.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.677
We don't think
it was a robbery.

16:57.710 --> 17:00.372
Mr. Piller still had
his wallet.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.445
The body wasn't
even searched.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.187
Now, we know it's a delicate
line to cross, but...

17:05.220 --> 17:07.609
if you could tell us if he ever
mentioned in your sessions

17:07.660 --> 17:10.527
anything about his life
being threatened...?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.721
Um, he had some anxiety,

17:12.760 --> 17:15.490
but Zach didn't lead the kind
of life

17:15.530 --> 17:17.691
that would make him
a murder target.

17:17.730 --> 17:20.335
He was essentially
just a regular guy.

17:20.370 --> 17:21.632
Could you be more specific?

17:21.670 --> 17:23.399
I don't know.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.761
He moved from Las Vegas
about eight months ago.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.529
He left his family
and friends behind.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.549
He worked at an aeronautics
fIrm, some start-up.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.814
The anxiety that you spoke of,

17:34.850 --> 17:36.579
did_ that have
a partIcular source?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.485
Um, you're getting
into his treatment.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.681
Dr. Sutherland,
two people are dead,

17:40.720 --> 17:43.484
and any detail may be crucial.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.181
I've-I've already told you
more than I have to.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.698
You'll have to just learn
the rest on your own.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.823
Okay.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.532
Thanks for your time.

17:55.740 --> 17:59.301
Well, I guess we know more
than we did before he came in.

17:59.340 --> 18:01.433
I propose a
division of labor.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.243
We already know
Piller's home address.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.703
There was an aeronautics firm
In the contacts In hIs phone.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.809
So you see what you can learn
at his apartment

18:07.850 --> 18:09.818
and Watson and I will
reconn0Iter hIs workplace.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.841
Sounds like a plan.

18:11.890 --> 18:16.315
Unmanned flight is the future
of domestic aviation.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.624
The field promises us secure
borders, safer neighborhoods...

18:18.660 --> 18:20.719
Piffle. They want
an army of drones

18:20.760 --> 18:22.728
keeping tabs
on all of us.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.819
Since when do you care about

18:24.870 --> 18:26.326
other people's privacy?

18:26.370 --> 18:27.860
I make use of the tools
available to me.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.731
That doesn't mean to
say I have to applaud

18:29.770 --> 18:31.533
every advance
in the field.

18:31.570 --> 18:34.334
Are you okay?
You seem very normal

18:34.380 --> 18:37.679
since I told you about Mycroft.
I expected more harassment.

18:37.710 --> 18:40.349
You haven't answered
hIs appeal yet.

18:40.380 --> 18:43.349
I'm giving you time and
space to craft your reply.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.244
Oh, that's mature.

18:47.390 --> 18:49.779
You're Holmes _and Watson?
Ellen PIerce.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.425
I'm... I was Zach's boss.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.758
His parents contacted me

18:54.800 --> 18:56.427
right after they were informed.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.360
This is so terrible.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.765
You manufacture drones?

18:59.800 --> 19:01.688
Um...

19:01.740 --> 19:03.367
"drones" is a very loaded term.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.832
But we are developing
the capacity

19:04.870 --> 19:06.701
to build unmanned vehicles.

19:06.740 --> 19:09.629
At the moment, only the military
or the government can fly

19:09.680 --> 19:11.898
UAVs over domestic airspace.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.747
What did Zach Piller do here?

19:13.780 --> 19:16.317
Zach flew UAVs
for McCarthy-Strauss.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.784
_ That's one
of the bIg mIIItary contractors.

19:18.820 --> 19:20.356
Did he have any enemies?

19:20.390 --> 19:22.381
A... a rival here, maybe?

19:22.420 --> 19:26.322
Sometimes he talked about his
old roommate back in Vegas.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.897
I-I guess they restored
a classic car together,

19:28.930 --> 19:31.626
and then the guy tried to
claim that it was all his.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.831
Zach was dealing
with a lawsuit.

19:33.870 --> 19:37.704
The way Zach described him, the
roommate sounded a bit unstable.

19:37.740 --> 19:40.402
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.408
No, I don't believe so.
Not at the moment.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.441
Thank you very much.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.748
All right,
I say we head home.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.668
I promised Tess I would stop by.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.415
We can see
what Bell found

19:51.450 --> 19:54.385
at Piller's apartment
and look into this lawsuit.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.956
Fine ideas.

19:55.990 --> 19:59.323
I'll meet you back there.
I have an errand to run.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.533
(camera shutter clicks)

20:14.710 --> 20:17.508
MYCROFI':
The hostess said
my brother was here.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.347
To what do I owe the pleasure?

20:19.380 --> 20:21.814
Do you see that man in
linen over in the corner?

20:21.850 --> 20:25.445
When I was here months ago, he
was at exactly the same table.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.913
I suppose
he's a regular.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.724
Regular, indeed.
He just received a package.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.729
I'm sorry, are we here to talk
about the man in the corner?

20:33.760 --> 20:35.557
No.

20:35.600 --> 20:39.422
This pursuit of Watson must end.

20:39.470 --> 20:42.633
I've managed to achieve a
certain balance in my life,

20:42.670 --> 20:45.537
and Watson is
essential to that.

20:45.570 --> 20:47.435
As my brother, I would think

20:47.480 --> 20:49.903
you'd be happy that I've
achieved a measure of stability.

20:49.940 --> 20:53.876
I certainly wouldn't think
that you'd look to disrupt that.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.549
My dating Joan doesn't need
to be a disruption.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.888
It is a disruption
and a distraction.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.649
Watson and I routinely
save lives,

21:01.690 --> 21:02.987
and I cannot and will not

21:03.020 --> 21:05.682
allow anything to get
in the way of that.

21:05.730 --> 21:07.595
Have you considered
the likelihood

21:07.630 --> 21:09.848
that you're consistently
undervaluing that woman?

21:09.900 --> 21:11.891
I hold her work
in the highest esteem.

21:11.930 --> 21:15.434
I'm not talking about her work,
I'm talking about her.

21:15.470 --> 21:19.031
You_ value Joan
to preCIsely the extent

21:19.070 --> 21:21.538
that she's a salve
for your many neuroses.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.605
You purport to be her friend,

21:23.650 --> 21:26.471
and yet you don't care a whit
about her happiness.

21:26.510 --> 21:28.671
Well, I hardly think you're
essential to her happiness.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.608
She has a very
symmetrical face--

21:30.650 --> 21:32.914
she will attract a mate
when she's ready.

21:32.950 --> 21:35.919
And there you'll be,
to pick him apart and find flaws

21:35.960 --> 21:39.680
and hoard her gifts to yourself.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.063
You're welcome to a meal
on the house.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.728
I'll do you the favor
of not telling Joan

21:46.770 --> 21:49.659
this conversation ever happened.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.545
Oh, hey.
I didn't hear you come in.

21:57.580 --> 21:59.946
That lawsuit thing
was a bust.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.948
What are you working on?

22:01.980 --> 22:04.687
Proof that my brother is
either an idiot or a criminal.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.540
I went to see
Mycroft today.

22:06.590 --> 22:07.955
Why?

22:07.990 --> 22:10.083
This man was sitting at a corner
table in his restaurant,

22:10.120 --> 22:11.553
the very same place
he was sitting

22:12.560 --> 22:14.198
He received
a package at this table today.

22:14.230 --> 22:17.666
I better not have been
the subject of thIs meetIng.
Course you were. Doesn't matter.

22:19.900 --> 22:22.960
Listen to me: This man's
name is Guillaume de Soto.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.104
The DST in France
have long suspected that

22:25.140 --> 22:27.973
he is a high-ranking lieutenant
in Le Milieu. If you're

22:28.010 --> 22:30.843
not familiar with them,
they're a French-Corsican
criminal organization.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.700
And their New York
office, apparently,

22:32.750 --> 22:34.570
is now headquartered
at Diogenes.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.487
So the guy eats there.
Mycroft is not responsible

22:37.520 --> 22:39.488
for everyone who
walks into the restaurant.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.714
He's either lazy
and inattentive,

22:40.760 --> 22:42.512
or he's involved
WIth these people.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.982
You're paranoid. And I don't
care about any of this.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.349
You know what, this whole
conversation stems from

22:45.390 --> 22:47.995
a massive violation
of my prIvacy.
The violation is incidental.

22:48.030 --> 22:50.760
No, I will tell you
if it's incidental or not.
(buzzmg)

22:50.800 --> 22:52.927
What are you doing?

22:52.970 --> 22:54.597
Shh.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.149
(buzzing,
light clinking against glass)

23:08.180 --> 23:10.045
Look.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.782
Is that a mosquito,
or a...?

23:17.790 --> 23:18.984
What is that noise?

23:19.030 --> 23:21.624
It's metal striking glass.

23:21.660 --> 23:23.127
It's not an insect.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.889
It's a machine.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.931
(beep)

23:38.980 --> 23:41.642
(quietly):
Surveillance vehicles
disguised as small objects

23:41.680 --> 23:44.183
are the vanguard
of drone technology.

23:44.220 --> 23:47.587
I'm quite certain that there's
a camera attached to that thing.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.053
They're capable
of making recordings,

23:49.090 --> 23:51.979
even injecting toxins
under the skin.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.622
That thing's been
following us ever since

23:53.660 --> 23:55.059
we discovered
Zach Piller's body.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.056
Why?

23:57.100 --> 23:58.658
Who sent that?

23:58.700 --> 24:00.565
The people
responsible for his death.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.795
I imagine they want to keep tabs
on our investigation.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.934
I now know why the shotgun
firing pattern was so strange.

24:05.970 --> 24:08.029
The weapon wasn't held
by human hands.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.674
It was attached to a vehicle.

24:10.710 --> 24:15.579
Paige Dahl and Zach Piller
were killed by drones.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.196
(recording of
gently flowing water plays)

24:28.230 --> 24:30.118
(buzzing)

24:30.160 --> 24:32.822
A bug that is
literally a bug.

24:32.870 --> 24:34.861
It's like something
from a sci-fi movie.

24:34.900 --> 24:38.165
From this point forward, we must
assume that we're being watched.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.805
How do you go from looking
at that to thinking that

24:41.840 --> 24:43.808
Paige and Piller
were killed by drones?

24:43.850 --> 24:45.249
Well, once it became apparent

24:45.280 --> 24:46.872
that unmanned vehicles
were Involved,

24:46.910 --> 24:49.743
I realized why the firing
pattern at the scene

24:49.780 --> 24:51.748
was so unusual.

24:51.790 --> 24:54.258
Zach Piller's murderers
tracked his whereabouts

24:54.290 --> 24:56.155
via high-flying drone
and then dispatched

24:56.190 --> 24:59.057
something like this
to finish the job.

24:59.090 --> 25:00.591
That looks like
something someone could've

25:00.630 --> 25:02.723
built in their garage.
Mm.

25:02.760 --> 25:05.763
So they sent two
kinds of drones

25:05.800 --> 25:08.598
to kill Piller and Paige
and sent a third one...

25:08.640 --> 25:10.631
to keep an eye on us.

25:10.670 --> 25:13.161
The people we're looking for
command powerful resources.

25:15.210 --> 25:17.075
and her fledgling
startup company,

25:17.110 --> 25:21.718
but McCarthy-Strauss,
Piller's old employers.

25:21.750 --> 25:24.139
They're industry leaders.

25:24.190 --> 25:27.318
But why would they
want to kill him?

25:27.350 --> 25:30.285
HOLMES:
I suppose I should be flattered.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.584
When Detective Bell collected
the dead man's effects,

25:32.630 --> 25:35.599
obviously he imagined
I would find some meaning

25:35.630 --> 25:37.723
in a collection
of fast food receipts

25:37.770 --> 25:40.330
and faded photographs
of Mr. Piller's high school

25:40.370 --> 25:43.703
marching band--
alas, I'm not a psychic.

25:46.140 --> 25:49.200
You know what's
not here?

25:49.240 --> 25:52.607
That computer.
Notably absent, yes.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.716
These are all recent.

25:58.750 --> 26:02.208
Group of articles about
a massacre in Afghanistan.

26:02.260 --> 26:06.651
Group of CIA contractors
disguised in tribal gear,

26:06.690 --> 26:08.749
killed near the Naghlu Dam.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.667
Mistaken for Taliban fighters
and fired on by UAV.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.895
Looks like Piller talked
to his psychiatrist about it.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.761
"Sutherland is wrong.
If it's not my fault,

26:16.800 --> 26:18.108
whose is it?"

26:18.140 --> 26:20.108
Do you think Piller
was responsible for this?

26:20.140 --> 26:22.802
Sounds like he
told his psychiatrist he was.

26:26.310 --> 26:27.777
Look at this.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.708
"I have to say something."

26:31.890 --> 26:34.085
"Pentagon sources refused
to comment, but the practice

26:34.120 --> 26:36.782
of employing civilian analysts
to fly surveillance drones

26:36.820 --> 26:39.288
has many detractors."

26:39.330 --> 26:41.025
Perhaps Piller was the man

26:41.060 --> 26:44.860
who misidentified
the Americans who died.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.925
Well, a month after the incident
he left McCarthy-Strauss

26:46.970 --> 26:49.063
and sought counseling.
Something was bothering him.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.807
And suddenly there's
no shortage of suspects.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.808
Executives at
McCarthy-Strauss?

26:53.840 --> 26:55.979
Any number of them would
want to keep this quiet.

26:56.010 --> 26:57.329
They're planning an IPO,
an expansion

26:57.380 --> 26:59.803
into the civilian market.

26:59.850 --> 27:03.809
But so far the only person
that we know has covered this up

27:03.850 --> 27:06.045
is Piller's psychiatrist.

27:06.090 --> 27:08.149
McCarthy-Strauss
are rather obvious suspects;

27:08.190 --> 27:10.078
their motives were known
to Dr. Sutherland.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.953
This is precisely the kind of
thing I hoped he would divulge,

27:12.990 --> 27:15.049
and yet, he chose
to say nothing.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.091
I'd like to take
a closer look at the doctor.

27:19.230 --> 27:20.731
You know, um...

27:20.770 --> 27:22.067
can you get started
on your own?

27:22.100 --> 27:24.739
I have a...
lunch thing.

27:24.770 --> 27:26.909
You don't have a lunch thing
while we're working.

27:26.940 --> 27:28.908
It's with Mycroft, isn't it?

27:28.940 --> 27:30.976
Oh, that's
none of your business.

27:31.010 --> 27:32.978
WATSON:
First of all,

27:33.010 --> 27:34.875
I'm sorry that Sherlock
came here yesterday.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.876
No need to apologize.
I'm well acquainted

27:36.920 --> 27:38.842
with my brother's
eccentricities.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.984
I am having some
boundary issues with him.

27:42.020 --> 27:43.988
I will take care of them.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.986
But it has been challenging--

27:46.030 --> 27:47.998
thinking about our
conversation the other day--

27:48.030 --> 27:49.224
without thinking of Sherlock.

27:49.260 --> 27:52.764
Precisely his intention,
I'd imagine.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.768
Yeah, I understand that.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.008
_ I've had a wonderful time
WIth you on multIple occaSIons.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.008
Which leads me to
this belief that

28:00.040 --> 28:01.769
if a few things
were different,

28:01.810 --> 28:04.005
we'd be a great match.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.904
The thing is, right now,
it's just too much.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.009
Sherlock is my
business partner.

28:08.050 --> 28:10.018
We share a
IIVIng space.

28:10.050 --> 28:11.278
I understand.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.878
I'm disappointed, naturally.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.854
Uh, I-I wasn't finished yet.

28:14.890 --> 28:17.882
Right now it is
overwhelming,

28:17.930 --> 28:19.955
but it doesn't have
to stay that way.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.151
There is one thing that
has to happen in my life

28:22.200 --> 28:23.428
and I've been
putting it off.

28:23.460 --> 28:26.020
Inertia, I guess.

28:26.070 --> 28:28.061
I need to get
my own place.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.030
You're thinking of moving out?

28:33.070 --> 28:34.435
Yes. And I
was thinking

28:34.480 --> 28:37.176
that ifI have my
own place, and...

28:37.210 --> 28:40.099
Sherlock isn't hovering
around me 18 hours a day,

28:40.150 --> 28:42.448
that spending time
with his brother

28:42.480 --> 28:44.448
might not be so
overwhelming.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.219
That would follow.

28:46.250 --> 28:48.150
I hope so.

28:48.190 --> 28:49.953
I mean, I'd like
to find out.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.350
(Watson laughs gently)

28:55.260 --> 28:58.127
(phone chimes twice)

29:00.470 --> 29:03.234
I should go.

29:05.110 --> 29:07.135
(camera shutter clicks)

29:07.170 --> 29:09.172
Oh, thank you.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.185
You not get my text?

29:19.220 --> 29:20.858
I did, I—I just
got sidetracked.

29:20.890 --> 29:22.289
I think you
might have been right.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.083
Yeah. On what topic?

29:24.130 --> 29:26.189
The clientele at Diogenes.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.289
This guy was eating with
the man that you noticed.

29:28.330 --> 29:32.096
Facial recognition did not
come up with any matches, but...

29:32.130 --> 29:34.189
it brought up this old BOLO.
The man in the sketch

29:34.240 --> 29:36.265
was spotted by witnesses
at the scene of a massacre.

29:36.300 --> 29:39.201
13 cartel lieutenants
killed at once.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.299
There was suspicion that
Le Milieu was involved.

29:41.340 --> 29:43.001
So, we still think
the French criminals

29:43.040 --> 29:44.439
cannot get enough of
my brother's caprese?

29:44.480 --> 29:47.108
Mycroft is not a criminal,

29:47.150 --> 29:48.515
but there is something
shady going on.

29:48.550 --> 29:50.211
We should warn him.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.444
Your faith in my
brother is touching.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.219
I wish I shared it.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.252
Is that....
It's guano.

29:55.290 --> 29:57.258
I stumbled upon a bat
colony in the steeple

29:57.290 --> 29:59.884
of St. Olaf's Church while
you were romancing my brother.

29:59.930 --> 30:01.898
I wasn't... (grumbles)
I was in pursuit
of a lost cat,

30:01.930 --> 30:05.320
belonging to one our
friends in Everyone.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.326
Can't we find a hacker
collective that accepts cash?

30:07.370 --> 30:09.338
Everyone went through
Dr. Sutherland's

30:09.370 --> 30:11.406
digital life with a
fine-tooth comb,
and something

30:11.440 --> 30:14.034
quite noxious stuck
in the teeth.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.001
McCarthy-Strauss

30:15.040 --> 30:16.234
paid him a hefty
consulting fee

30:16.280 --> 30:18.009
the very same week
that Zach Piller

30:18.050 --> 30:20.006
left the firm and
began therapy.

30:20.050 --> 30:23.144
$200,000.
You think
Dr. Sutherland took a bribe?

30:23.180 --> 30:25.284
IfI had to guess,
I'd say that they were
paying him to report back

30:25.320 --> 30:27.447
on whether their
disgruntled former employee
was intending to go public.

30:27.490 --> 30:29.913
But I don't have to guess.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.428
I can ask him myself when
Detective Bell brings him
in this afternoon.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.257
Marcus can't just
pull a doctor off the street

30:34.300 --> 30:36.097
to ask him about
consultIng fees.

30:36.130 --> 30:37.495
Consulting fees were
not the only thing

30:37.530 --> 30:39.225
that Everyone turned up.

30:42.100 --> 30:45.035
Am I supposed to
recognize that?

30:45.070 --> 30:46.935
You should.
We found it buried

30:46.970 --> 30:49.507
in your plot in the Third
Street community gardens.

30:49.540 --> 30:51.542
BELL: Plus, we got an anonymous
tip from another gardener.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.548
Saw you bury
a box of those

30:53.580 --> 30:55.969
in your plot.
GREGSON: So let's take it
as a given that you

30:56.020 --> 30:57.510
know what a
Barnen Delight is.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.086
It's just...

30:59.120 --> 31:01.088
Italian candy.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.985
With a... There's
a little toy inside.

31:03.020 --> 31:05.056
A little toy that
constitutes a choking hazard.

31:05.090 --> 31:09.254
Which is why the FDA
banned those eggs.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.268
You had 60.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.461
BELL:
What'd you have, an Italian
patient or something?

31:13.500 --> 31:16.162
I mean, how does
a psychiatrist get involved

31:16.200 --> 31:18.202
in the black market
for candy eggs?

31:18.240 --> 31:21.607
You've been picked up
for drunk and disorderly

31:21.640 --> 31:23.437
twice since 2009.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.607
Now this.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.141
I don't know how long
your rap sheet has to be

31:28.180 --> 31:30.546
before the state medical board
pulls your |Icense,

31:30.580 --> 31:33.048
but you got to be
getting close.

31:33.090 --> 31:34.978
All that said,

31:35.020 --> 31:36.510
you help us out...

31:36.560 --> 31:39.051
maybe we look
the other way.

31:39.090 --> 31:40.352
We_ want to know _
everythIng that Zach PIller

31:40.390 --> 31:43.518
said about the_ massacre
In AfghanIstan.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.529
And we want the names of
the people you reported to

31:46.570 --> 31:48.197
at McCarthy-Strauss.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.368
We know about your
"consulting fee."

31:51.410 --> 31:54.208
GREGSON:
Fill in the blanks.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.003
Um...

31:56.040 --> 31:59.544
Zach was flying
a surveillance drone last fall.

31:59.580 --> 32:03.243
He saw a group marching
near this river,

32:03.280 --> 32:06.647
fanned out just like
a Taliban scout unit.

32:06.690 --> 32:08.578
They turned out to be Americans.

32:08.620 --> 32:11.123
It was just a few
pixels on a screen,

32:11.160 --> 32:13.253
so he passed
his assessment on

32:13.290 --> 32:16.054
and the Army ordered a strike.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.319
The company was worried
when Zach left.

32:19.370 --> 32:23.067
I don't know how they knew
I was his therapist,

32:23.100 --> 32:27.161
but one day a guy showed up,
making me an offer.

32:27.210 --> 32:29.269
Was Zach Piller
gonna go pubIIc?

32:29.310 --> 32:30.675
Did you tell
the company?

32:30.710 --> 32:32.405
He told me he
wrote it all down.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.145
Some kind of report.

32:34.180 --> 32:36.171
He said he was gonna
send it to the media.

32:36.220 --> 32:39.087
I did not know that they
were gonna kill him.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.610
(buzzing)
Who was your contact
at the company?

32:40.650 --> 32:42.652
Is there...
Is there a bug in here?

32:44.130 --> 32:45.085
Cap--!

32:45.130 --> 32:46.620
(pounding on glass)
Ow.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.525
The damn thing
just bit me.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.391
Whoa.
You all _right?
(gaggIng)

32:50.430 --> 32:53.422
Hey, we need some
help in here.
Call an ambulance!

32:53.470 --> 32:55.290
(gagging)

32:55.340 --> 32:57.092
Dr. Sutherland, Dr. Sutherland,
can you hear me?

32:57.140 --> 32:58.266
GREGSON:
What is this?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.460
Where is it?
Do you see It?
Where's what?

33:00.510 --> 33:04.173
Did it fly in the vent?
WATSON:
He's in cardiac arrest.

33:04.210 --> 33:06.349
He may not make it.
What the hell's going on?

33:06.380 --> 33:07.677
He's been poisoned.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.709
Judging by his
symptoms, I'd say

33:16.760 --> 33:19.024
Dr. Sutherland was killed
using phenylsilatrane.

33:19.060 --> 33:21.699
It's a cousin to strychnine.

33:21.730 --> 33:24.563
And the drone used
to poison him was no doubt sent

33:24.600 --> 33:26.067
by the same people

33:26.100 --> 33:28.034
at McCarthy-Strauss who
killed Piller and Dahl.

33:28.070 --> 33:29.367
Most likely entered
and exited

33:29.400 --> 33:31.561
via an open door or an air duct.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.634
If it left at all.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.331
So, you say

33:34.380 --> 33:37.304
they sent one of these things
to your house?

33:37.340 --> 33:39.308
We think that drone was used
for reconnaIssance.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.669
They needed to kill Sutherland.

33:40.710 --> 33:42.246
He was going
to tell us everything.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.043
But I don't think
they'd be foolhardy enough

33:44.090 --> 33:46.285
to attack the police
or their associates.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.639
You've got one of their drones
at your house.

33:47.690 --> 33:49.317
That should be good
for a warrant.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.782
Well, we could
bring it in for you

33:50.820 --> 33:52.754
to have a look at,
but we couldn't find anything

33:52.790 --> 33:54.326
that would definitely tie it
to McCarthy-Strauss.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.349
We're pretty sure

33:55.400 --> 33:56.298
that McCarthy-Strauss stole
Piller's computer

33:58.330 --> 34:01.265
If we can find another copy,
that would give us motive.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.666
What if there isn't another copy
of that report?

34:03.700 --> 34:04.803
Well, as it stands,
we have little else

34:04.840 --> 34:06.137
in the way of evidence.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.707
Find me some.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.705
(inhales and exhales
deeply)

34:13.750 --> 34:16.719
The brain trust of
McCarthy-Strauss.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.310
At least_ one of these men is
responSIble for three deaths.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.659
We have no way to link
the company to the crimes,

34:21.690 --> 34:24.784
much less the individual
or individuals involved.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.388
You think that Piller confided
In someone

34:26.430 --> 34:27.681
other than Dr. Sutherland?

34:27.730 --> 34:29.391
What we need is Piller's report.

34:29.430 --> 34:31.091
Everything else is just hearsay.

34:32.730 --> 34:34.368
You know, McCarthy-Strauss
doesn't know

34:34.400 --> 34:37.164
that Piller only made one copy
of that report.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.168
Who's to say
we didn't find another one

34:39.210 --> 34:40.700
during our investigation?

34:40.740 --> 34:42.332
You're proposing a bluff?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.177
Yeah, well,
the corporate offices are

34:44.210 --> 34:45.768
near Wall Street.

34:45.810 --> 34:48.608
Shouldn't be too difficult
to arrange a face-to-face.

35:19.410 --> 35:21.776
(phone chimes)

35:36.930 --> 35:39.694
(phone chimes twice)

35:52.250 --> 35:53.672
(grunting)

35:53.710 --> 35:54.711
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

36:13.230 --> 36:15.698
Where'd you get
the report?

36:16.800 --> 36:17.789
(elevator bell dings)

36:26.780 --> 36:28.270
Excuse me. There's a woman

36:28.320 --> 36:29.844
lying unconscious
on the bathroom floor.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.519
I tried to open the door,
but the stall was locked.

36:32.550 --> 36:35.280
I'll call 911.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.754
Yes. Medical emergency.

36:37.790 --> 36:39.883
43 Pearl Street.

36:47.830 --> 36:51.960
I need to know you got it before
we can have a conversation.

36:52.010 --> 36:55.969
Pi|_|er saved several
copIes onto the cloud.

36:56.010 --> 36:59.207
We have consultants who can
extract that kind of thing.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.894
Could you tell me the first
sentence of the report, please?

37:22.940 --> 37:25.761
Beg your pardon?

37:25.810 --> 37:28.870
I'd like to hear
the first sentence.

37:28.910 --> 37:31.378
If you wanted me to
memorize a passage for you,

37:31.410 --> 37:34.277
then you should have had your
mosquito pass a message along.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.312
So, show me your copy.

37:48.930 --> 37:52.320
Say something to convince me
you got it, or we're done.

37:52.370 --> 37:53.997
It's got a rather
convincing drawing

37:54.030 --> 37:56.396
of a pony on
the front cover.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.007
(beeping)

38:04.510 --> 38:06.068
You know what?
Never mInd.

38:06.110 --> 38:07.873
I'm ending this.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.309
(phone ringing)

38:09.350 --> 38:11.045
That's your office calling,
I'd imagine.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.514
Might want to get that.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.058
Kenneth Carlson.

38:19.090 --> 38:20.955
WATSON:
"My name is Zach Piller.

38:20.990 --> 38:22.958
"On September 22, 2009,

38:23.000 --> 38:24.968
"I was involved
in an authorized attack

38:25.000 --> 38:26.968
"on CIA operatives
in Afghanistan,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.537
"resulting in ten deaths
that were

38:29.570 --> 38:31.629
quickly covered up by
my employer McCarthy-Strauss."

38:31.670 --> 38:33.399
Who the hell is this?

38:33.440 --> 38:36.079
How'd you get in my office?

38:36.110 --> 38:38.374
Hello?

38:38.410 --> 38:40.844
If you were thinking
of running, I wouldn't bother.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.610
There are several police cars
parked nearby.

38:49.690 --> 38:52.022
I just got off the phone
with Captain Gregson.

38:52.060 --> 38:55.359
Apparently, Kenneth Carlson's
name was all over that report.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.698
He requisitioned the cash
to pay off Dr. Sutherland.

38:57.730 --> 38:59.869
He was the prime mover
behind the cover-up.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.697
So, between that and all
the circumstantial evidence,

39:01.740 --> 39:03.139
Captain Gregson brought him in.

39:03.170 --> 39:06.139
He already made a deal
and got a break from the DA.

39:06.170 --> 39:07.637
The report is going public.

39:07.670 --> 39:09.103
We should feel good.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.404
This is what
Zach Piller would have wanted.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.475
Hmm.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.478
So, I'm going
to go see your brother.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.112
Do you want to come?

39:17.150 --> 39:19.118
You can help explain
what Le Milieu is.

39:19.150 --> 39:21.015
You have a better handle
on it than I do.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.055
Watson?

39:30.700 --> 39:33.624
I've not respected
your privacy.

39:33.670 --> 39:35.888
I apologize for that.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.928
Please know, I value you

39:39.970 --> 39:41.733
_ for more _
than just the many beneﬁts

39:41.780 --> 39:43.099
you've brought into my life.

39:43.140 --> 39:45.700
I value you as a person.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.706
That's nice.

39:47.750 --> 39:49.615
It really is.

39:49.650 --> 39:52.118
But your apologies
always seem to come

39:52.150 --> 39:54.380
after you already got
what you wanted.

39:59.090 --> 40:00.955
(door opens)

40:00.990 --> 40:03.424
(indistinct conversations)

40:33.490 --> 40:35.958
(speaking softly in French)

40:42.240 --> 40:44.663
(speaking softly in French)

40:55.780 --> 40:58.146
(fire crackling)

41:28.180 --> 41:30.717
*

41:59.880 --> 42:02.246
*

42:19.300 --> 42:20.767
(French accent):
Turnabout is fair play.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.598
You take my picture,
I take yours.

42:24.770 --> 42:25.737
(muffled)'
No! '

42:25.770 --> 42:27.601
(muffled)'
No! '

42:27.640 --> 42:28.732
