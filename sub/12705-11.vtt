WEBVTT

00:12.580 --> 00:13.846
(leaves rustling)

00:16.350 --> 00:18.551
Is it a vampire?

00:18.585 --> 00:19.820
Mom, what are you
doing here?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.388
I brought you
a snack.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.756
I thought
it was about time

00:22.789 --> 00:24.024
for me to come
out and watch.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.859
You know, the slaying.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.762
You know, the slaying
is kind of an alone thing.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.199
But it's such
a big part of your life,

00:31.231 --> 00:33.100
and I'd like to understand
it.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.668
It's, um, you
know,
something we could share.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.238
Actually,
it's pretty dull, you know.

00:38.271 --> 00:41.142
It's bam, boom, stick...
poof.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.777
(grunting, snarling)

00:47.814 --> 00:49.450
Good, honey!
Kill him!

00:52.386 --> 00:54.722
Buffy, he's over here!

00:54.755 --> 00:57.290
(growls)
JOYCE:
Oh, my God!

00:57.325 --> 00:59.093
It's Mr. Sanderson
from the bank.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.432
And he's getting away!

01:04.465 --> 01:06.200
Stay!

01:06.233 --> 01:08.668
*

01:37.465 --> 01:40.134
(growling)

01:40.168 --> 01:42.002
Ah!

01:44.638 --> 01:46.006
Oh, God.

02:07.995 --> 02:11.098
(wolf howling)

02:11.131 --> 02:13.200
*

03:01.181 --> 03:03.550
(siren wails)

03:03.584 --> 03:06.019
(indistinct radio chatter)

03:08.055 --> 03:10.424
(camera shutter clicking)

03:40.721 --> 03:42.555
They said we can
go home now.

03:43.656 --> 03:46.126
They were little
kids.

03:46.158 --> 03:47.694
Did you see them?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.430
They're so tiny.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.031
I saw.

03:52.064 --> 03:55.603
Who could do
something like this?

03:55.635 --> 03:57.069
I just...

03:57.103 --> 04:00.106
I'm so sorry that
you had to see this.

04:00.139 --> 04:02.443
But I promise,
everything's
going to be okay.

04:02.475 --> 04:03.811
How?

04:03.843 --> 04:06.212
Because I'm going
to find whatever did
it.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.782
I guess.

04:08.816 --> 04:12.051
It's just, you can't...

04:12.085 --> 04:14.655
you can't make it right.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.293
I know.
(crying)

04:19.326 --> 04:20.728
I'm sorry.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.896
But I'll take care
of everything.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.331
I
promise.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.233
Just try and calm down.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.235
Don't tell me to calm down.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.471
I-I-I only
meant...

04:30.504 --> 04:33.072
They were kids, Giles.
Little kids.

04:33.105 --> 04:34.475
You don't know what it was like

04:34.507 --> 04:36.242
to see them there.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.312
My mom can't even talk.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.514
I'm sorry.
I...
I just want to help.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.783
I know.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.153
Do we know how? I mean...

04:46.185 --> 04:47.788
It wasn't the vampire?

04:47.821 --> 04:49.490
No. There were
no marks.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.790
Wait.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.661
I mean, there...
there was a mark,

04:53.694 --> 04:55.663
um, a-a
symbol.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.665
Oh, uh, 12th century,
papal encyclical.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.966
Try this.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.971
It was on their hands.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.038
The cops are keeping it
quiet,

05:06.072 --> 05:07.841
but I got a good look at it.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.108
There.

05:09.141 --> 05:10.610
Find me the thing
that uses the symbol

05:10.644 --> 05:11.845
and point me at
it.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.380
Hmm.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.048
Hmm,
what?

05:15.081 --> 05:16.449
Giles, speak.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.285
Oh, sorry.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.187
Um, no, it...

05:20.220 --> 05:22.990
I just wonder if
we're looking for a thing.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.992
The use of a symbol
o-on a victim like this,

05:26.026 --> 05:28.528
it suggests a-a ritual
murder,

05:28.562 --> 05:30.730
an occult sacrifice by a group.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.401
A group of... human beings.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.737
Someone with a soul did this?

05:36.769 --> 05:39.238
Yes, I'm afraid so.

05:39.271 --> 05:41.408
Okay.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.810
Then while you're
looking for the
meaning
of that symbol thingy,

05:43.843 --> 05:45.478
could you also
find a
loophole

05:45.512 --> 05:47.581
in that "slayers don't
kill people" rule?

05:47.615 --> 05:48.882
Buffy...

05:50.350 --> 05:52.252
This is a dreadful crime,
I know,

05:52.284 --> 05:56.322
and you have every right
to be upset, but...

05:56.355 --> 05:58.725
I-I wonder if you're not
letting yourself

05:58.759 --> 06:00.761
get a shade, uh, more
personal

06:00.793 --> 06:03.096
because of
your mother's involvement.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.432
Oh, it's completely personal.

06:05.466 --> 06:08.569
Giles, find me
the people that did this.

06:08.601 --> 06:09.870
Please.

06:10.903 --> 06:14.206
(indistinct chatter)

06:14.240 --> 06:16.444
Hey
Hey.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.480
So, a burrito.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.617
This is a burrito.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.752
Damn straight.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.591
Hi, Oz.
Hey.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.860
Xander. Hi.
Hey, Amy.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.127
Hi, guys.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.697
XANDER:
Hey, Amy.
I like your new hair.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.199
I haven't see you all day.
Where you been?

06:39.231 --> 06:42.134
Not with me.
No, sir. Ask anyone.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.803
No.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.814
So, Buffy's birthday's
next week.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.082
Ooh! Yeah.

06:56.115 --> 06:57.451
Good.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.252
I've been pondering
gift options.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.252
Shh.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.889
Oh, come on, we just
got a topic here.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.122
Hi, Buffy.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.725
Buffy. What's up?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.226
You guys didn't hear?

07:07.259 --> 07:09.096
Hear what?

07:09.129 --> 07:10.396
A murder.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.733
Somebody killed two little kids.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.966
Oh, no.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.737
They were, like,
seven or eight years old.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.005
My mom found the bodies
during patrol last night.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.406
Oh, my God.

07:20.439 --> 07:21.675
Kids?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.143
Why was your mom there?
More bad.

07:23.175 --> 07:25.345
She picked last night,
of all nights,

07:25.377 --> 07:27.079
for a surprise bonding visit.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.915
God, your mom would
actually take the time

07:28.949 --> 07:30.182
to do that with you?

07:32.351 --> 07:35.154
That really wasn't the point
of the story, was it?

07:35.187 --> 07:38.091
No. The point is,
she's completely wigging.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.259
Who's wigging?

07:40.293 --> 07:42.829
Um... everyone.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.665
You know,
'cause of what happened.

07:44.697 --> 07:46.766
Oh, it's so awful.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.468
I-I had bad dreams
about it all
night.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.470
Hi, Mrs. Summers.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.872
Oh, hi, everybody.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.374
Hi.
Hi, Mrs. Summers.

07:54.406 --> 07:56.677
Buffy, have you talked
to Mr. Giles yet

07:56.709 --> 07:58.512
about who
could
have done
this?

07:58.545 --> 08:00.346
Yeah. He, uh...

08:00.379 --> 08:03.684
he thinks it might be
something ritual.

08:03.716 --> 08:04.651
Occult.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.185
But he's still looking.

08:06.218 --> 08:08.221
In the meantime,
we're gonna add to my patrol

08:08.254 --> 08:09.990
and-and, you
know,
keep an eye out.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.223
Occult.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.360
Like witches.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.728
(coughing)

08:16.196 --> 08:19.031
Sorry. Phlegm.
Too much dairy.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.401
Oh, I-I know you kids
think that stuff's cool.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.903
Buffy told me you dabble.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.170
WILLOW:
Right.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.538
Absolutely. That's me.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.574
I'm a-a dabbler.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.643
But anybody who could
do this isn't
cool.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.211
Anybody who could do this
has to be a monster. It's...

08:32.245 --> 08:33.581
You know what?

08:33.614 --> 08:36.414
Uh, would you guys excuse us
for a little bit?

08:36.448 --> 08:38.686
Uh, n-nice to see you.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.557
What a burn.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.057
I mean, Buff's
mom
was just starting

08:45.091 --> 08:46.594
to accept
the whole slayer thing,

08:46.626 --> 08:48.495
and now she's going
to be double freaked.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.230
Makes me grateful
that my mom's not
interested

08:50.263 --> 08:51.965
in my extracurricular
activities.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.769
Or my curricular activities.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.505
Are your friends
going to help with
the investigation,
too?

08:59.538 --> 09:02.610
Mom, I really think maybe
this isn't the best place

09:02.643 --> 09:04.543
to talk about this.

09:04.577 --> 09:05.946
Are you
embarrassed

09:05.979 --> 09:07.547
to be hanging out
with your mother?

09:07.581 --> 09:09.115
I didn't hug you.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.183
No. It's just...

09:11.217 --> 09:13.253
this hall is about school,

09:13.285 --> 09:14.721
and you're about home.

09:14.754 --> 09:17.423
Mix them,
my world dissolves.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.626
It's just,
I keep thinking about

09:19.659 --> 09:21.128
who could have
done such a
thing.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.629
I have to help.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.231
Well, Giles can always
use help in the library.

09:25.264 --> 09:26.566
I called
everybody
I know in town.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.100
I told them about
the dead
children.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.903
They're all just
as upset as I am.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.905
You called everybody
that you know?

09:32.940 --> 09:34.206
And they called
all their
friends.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.975
And guess what?

09:36.009 --> 09:38.044
We're setting up a vigil,
for tonight, for City Hall.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.712
The mayor is even
going to be
there.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.881
Now we are going to get
some action.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.283
Uh-huh.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.284
That's great. Uh...

09:45.317 --> 09:46.754
but you know
what?

09:46.787 --> 09:48.221
A lot of times,

09:48.254 --> 09:49.588
when we're
working
on stuff like this,

09:49.623 --> 09:51.725
we like to keep
the number of people

09:51.759 --> 09:54.494
that know about
it
kind of...small.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.764
Oh. Right.

09:56.797 --> 10:00.167
Well, I-I'm sure there won't be
all that many people.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.201
(indistinct conversations)

10:09.142 --> 10:10.110
Oh, hi...

10:10.143 --> 10:11.510
This is great.

10:11.543 --> 10:13.780
Maybe we could all go
patrolling together later.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.783
At least your
mom's
making an effort.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.283
My mom's probably...

10:17.317 --> 10:20.153
standing right in
front
of me right this second.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.788
Mom?

10:21.822 --> 10:24.091
Willow, I-I didn't know
you were going to be here.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.692
Oh, hi, Bunny.

10:25.725 --> 10:26.960
Hi.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.196
Mom, what are you
doing here?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.697
Oh, well, I read about it
in the paper,

10:30.730 --> 10:32.700
and what with
your dad out of town...

10:32.732 --> 10:34.334
Willow, you cut off your
hair.

10:34.366 --> 10:36.168
Huh, that's
a new look.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.806
Yeah, it's just
a sudden whim I had...

10:38.838 --> 10:40.707
in August.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.274
I like
it.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.509
Hello, Joyce.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.044
Sheila, I'm glad
you could come.

10:45.077 --> 10:46.446
There you are.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.181
I almost didn't find you
in this crush.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.684
Oh, uh, Mrs.,
uh...

10:51.719 --> 10:53.452
uh...
Joyce.

10:53.485 --> 10:55.388
Quite a turnout you have
here.

10:55.422 --> 10:58.692
Oh, well, it's...
it's not just me, but thank you.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.360
Well, it's, uh,
it's been a
while.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.129
Right.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.666
Not since, um, not since...

11:06.700 --> 11:08.500
not for a while.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.804
There's a rumor
going around, Mr. Giles.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.874
R-Rumor, about us?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.043
A-a-about
what?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.210
About witches.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.479
Uh, people calling
themselves witches

11:19.511 --> 11:21.514
are responsible for
this brutal
crime.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.750
Indeed? How strange.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.317
(laughs
nervously)
Yes. Strange.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.320
Witches. Pfft.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.822
Well, actually,
not that strange.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.724
I recently
co-authored a paper

11:30.758 --> 11:33.994
about the rise of mysticism
among
adolescents,

11:34.027 --> 11:35.863
and I was shocked
at the statistical...

11:35.895 --> 11:37.831
(microphone feedback whines)
Oh.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.567
Oh, are we
starting?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.936
(mayor clears throat and sniffs)

11:42.970 --> 11:44.604
MAYOR:
Hello, everybody.

11:44.636 --> 11:47.106
He'll do something
about this. You'll
see.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.375
Um...

11:49.408 --> 11:52.011
I want to thank you all
for coming

11:52.044 --> 11:56.249
in the aftermath
of such a tragic crime.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.186
Seeing you all here proves

11:59.219 --> 12:02.621
what a caring community
Sunnydale is.

12:02.654 --> 12:05.258
Now, sure, we've had
our share of misfortunes,

12:05.292 --> 12:09.261
but we're a good town
with good people,

12:09.296 --> 12:12.765
and I know that
none of us will rest easy

12:12.799 --> 12:15.903
until this horrible murder
is solved.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.370
With that in mind...

12:17.403 --> 12:21.573
I make these
words
my pledge to you:

12:21.607 --> 12:23.409
"Never again."

12:26.913 --> 12:29.282
Now I ask you
to give your attention

12:29.316 --> 12:31.951
to the woman who brought us
all here tonight, Joyce Summers.

12:34.486 --> 12:35.822
Thank you.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.793
Mr. Mayor...

12:40.827 --> 12:43.129
you're dead
wrong.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.097
(crowd murmuring)

12:45.131 --> 12:47.234
This is not a good town.

12:47.267 --> 12:51.238
How many of us have...
have lost someone who...

12:51.270 --> 12:53.139
who just disappeared?

12:53.173 --> 12:56.176
Or... or got skinned?

12:56.209 --> 12:58.077
Or suffered neck rupture?

12:58.110 --> 13:00.980
And how many of
us

13:01.014 --> 13:03.649
have been too afraid
to speak out?

13:03.682 --> 13:07.653
I was supposed to lead us
in a moment of silence,
but...

13:07.687 --> 13:10.789
silence is this town's disease.

13:12.192 --> 13:15.761
For too long
we-we've been plagued by

13:15.794 --> 13:17.264
unnatural evils.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.032
This isn't our town anymore.

13:19.066 --> 13:22.469
It belongs to the monsters

13:22.501 --> 13:24.004
and the witches and the slayers.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.976
I say it's time

13:30.009 --> 13:32.678
for the grown-ups
to take Sunnydale back.

13:32.711 --> 13:36.115
I say we start by finding
the people who did this

13:36.149 --> 13:37.951
and making them pay.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.052
(applause)
MAN:
Hear, hear!

13:48.360 --> 13:50.363
*

14:19.893 --> 14:21.894
*

14:32.304 --> 14:34.942
(bubbling and hissing)

15:00.466 --> 15:02.534
Watch it.
Oh, sorry.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.437
Did I make
you
smudge your eyeliner?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.206
You gonna put
a spell on
me?

15:06.239 --> 15:08.240
Hey, what is your problem?

15:08.274 --> 15:11.278
Everyone knows he's into
that voodoo witch crap.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.946
I heard about
those kids.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.214
People like
him...

15:14.246 --> 15:16.048
gotta learn a lesson.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.650
And what about people like
me?

15:18.684 --> 15:20.320
Get in my face
and you'll find out.

15:26.525 --> 15:27.793
No problem here.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.030
We're walking.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.471
You guys okay?

15:38.504 --> 15:39.905
Yeah.

15:39.938 --> 15:43.243
We're fine.
Thanks, Buffy.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.278
CORDELIA:
You're going to be
one busy little
slayer,

15:45.312 --> 15:47.246
baby-sitting them.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.480
I doubt they'll have
any more trouble.

15:48.514 --> 15:50.116
I doubt your
doubt.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.284
Everyone knows that
witches
killed those kids,

15:52.318 --> 15:54.153
and Amy is a
witch.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.922
And Michael is
whatever
the boy of witch is,

15:55.955 --> 15:58.290
plus being the poster
child for
yuck.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.259
Cordel...
If you're
going
to hang with them,

15:59.292 --> 16:01.160
expect
badness.

16:01.193 --> 16:02.528
'Cause that's
what you get

16:02.562 --> 16:04.163
when you hang with
freaks and losers.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.865
Believe me, I
know.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.668
That was a pointed comment

16:09.701 --> 16:11.671
about me hanging
with you guys.

16:11.703 --> 16:12.938
Yeah, I got that one.

16:12.971 --> 16:14.807
Besides, witches didn't do
it.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.309
Actually, I think
they may have.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.178
My research keeps
bringing me back

16:19.211 --> 16:22.115
to European Wiccan covens.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.716
You found the meaning
of the symbol?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.985
(sighs)
I'm pretty sure, yes.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.720
There's uh, one piece of
information I need

16:27.754 --> 16:29.188
that's in a book
that Willow borrowed.

16:29.221 --> 16:30.490
Can you find it?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.962
Buffy,
hi.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.730
Hey. Is Willow around?

16:38.764 --> 16:41.134
How can I
convince
you people that it's over?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.802
You assume because
I'm here, she's here,

16:42.835 --> 16:44.971
that I somehow mysteriously
know where she
is.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.639
Those her books?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.475
Yeah. She's in the bathroom.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.909
But the fact that
I know that doesn't change

16:50.942 --> 16:52.879
that I have a genuine
complaint here.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.047
Look. I'm getting sick

16:54.081 --> 16:56.482
of the judgment, the innuendoes.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.519
Is a man not innocent
until proven guilty?

16:59.552 --> 17:01.388
You are guilty.
You got illicit smoochies,

17:01.421 --> 17:03.755
gonna have to pay the price.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.491
But I'm talking about
the future guilt.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.727
Look, everyone expects me
to mess up again.

17:07.759 --> 17:09.096
Like Oz.

17:09.127 --> 17:10.363
I see how he is around me.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.231
You know, that steely gaze,

17:12.265 --> 17:14.733
that pointed silence.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.001
Cause he's usually
such a chatterbox.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.203
No, but it's
different now.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.173
It's more a verbal nonverbal.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.409
He speaks volumes with his eyes.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.445
Hey, Buff.
What you looking for?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.415
You want to borrow
something?

17:29.449 --> 17:31.617
What is this?

17:31.651 --> 17:33.420
A doodle. I do doodle.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.622
You, too.
You do doodle,
too.

17:35.654 --> 17:37.957
This is a witch symbol.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.791
Okay, yeah, it
is.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.059
Willow.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.295
What?

17:42.328 --> 17:44.263
That symbol was on
the murdered children.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.766
(lockers slamming shut)
POLICE OFFICER:
Kids, step back.

17:46.798 --> 17:50.569
Stay away from the lockers.
This is police business.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.406
OFFICER:
Want to give me
those, please?

17:54.441 --> 17:55.642
The books.

17:55.674 --> 17:57.644
(indistinct chatter, protest)

18:00.613 --> 18:02.148
Aw, man, it's Nazi Germany

18:02.182 --> 18:04.151
and I've got Playboys
in my locker.

18:04.183 --> 18:08.221
This is a glorious day
for principals everywhere.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.324
No pathetic whining
about students' rights.

18:11.357 --> 18:14.826
Just a long row of lockers
and a man with a key.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.498
They just took three kids away.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.133
What are they
looking for?

18:20.166 --> 18:22.634
Witch stuff.
What?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.471
They got my
spells.

18:24.503 --> 18:25.904
I'm supposed to report
to Snyder's
office.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.140
Oh, my God.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.142
OFFICER:
Move back, please.

18:29.175 --> 18:30.843
Okay Amy, you'll
have to come with me.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.144
Willow, be careful.
Get away from the locker.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.583
WILLOW
I have stuff in my locker.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.519
Henbane, hellebore,
mandrake root.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.520
Excuse me.
 Playboys.

18:41.554 --> 18:44.457
Can we turn
the
sympathy this way?

18:44.490 --> 18:48.661
Hey! Get your grubby
custodial hands off that.
Miss, stay back.

18:48.694 --> 18:52.632
That hair spray costs $45,
and it's
imported.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.866
My locker's next.
Buffy, I didn't
do

18:54.901 --> 18:57.804
anything
wrong.

18:57.836 --> 18:59.306
The-the symbol is harmless.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.007
I used it to make a
protection
spell for you,

19:01.039 --> 19:02.275
for your
birthday.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.109
With Michael and Amy.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.644
Only, now it's broken,
because you know about it,

19:05.678 --> 19:07.779
so happy birthday.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.016
And
please,
you have to believe
me.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.589
Ms. Rosenberg. My office.

19:26.365 --> 19:29.368
OFFICER:
Back up. Comin' through.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.403
*

19:39.445 --> 19:40.880
Giles.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.981
They're confiscating my books.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.584
Giles, we need
those books.
Believe me,

19:44.616 --> 19:47.086
I've tried to tell that to
the
nice man with the big gun.

19:47.118 --> 19:48.086
No. There's something
about the symbol

19:48.119 --> 19:49.655
that we're
missing.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.757
Willow said she used
it
in a protection spell.

19:50.789 --> 19:51.758
It's harmless.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.259
Not a big bad.

19:53.292 --> 19:54.693
So then
why
would it turn up

19:54.727 --> 19:56.194
in a ritual sacrifice?
I don't know.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.830
Ordinarily, I would say
let's widen our research.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.401
Using what?
A dictionary
and
 My Friend Flicka?

20:01.433 --> 20:03.435
This is intolerable.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.872
Snyder has interfered before,

20:05.904 --> 20:08.007
but I-I won't take this from
that twisted little homunculus.

20:08.039 --> 20:09.342
SNYDER
I love the smell

20:09.375 --> 20:12.010
of desperate librarian
in the
morning.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.413
You get out...

20:13.445 --> 20:16.182
and take your... marauders
with you.

20:16.214 --> 20:20.019
Oh, my. So fierce.

20:20.051 --> 20:21.621
I suppose
I should hear you out.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.590
Just how is, um...

20:24.624 --> 20:26.759
"Blood Rites and Sacrifices"

20:26.792 --> 20:29.228
appropriate material
for a public school library?

20:29.261 --> 20:32.030
Chess club branching out?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.232
This is not over.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.867
Oh, I should say
it's just beginning.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.869
Fight it, if you want.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.707
Just remember,
lift a finger against me,

20:40.740 --> 20:42.375
and you'll have
to answer to moo.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.644
"Answer to moo"?

20:44.676 --> 20:45.811
Did that sentence just
make

20:45.845 --> 20:47.947
some sense that I'm not in
on?

20:47.980 --> 20:50.215
Mothers Opposed to the
Occult.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.851
A powerful new group.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.221
And who came up
with that lame name?

20:55.253 --> 20:58.156
That would be the founder.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.660
I believe you call her "Mom."

21:04.797 --> 21:06.798
*

21:10.836 --> 21:13.472
Oh, sit down, honey.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.508
Principal Snyder
talk to you?

21:15.541 --> 21:17.344
Yes. He's
quite
concerned.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.811
Mom, I know what this looks
like, and I can totally...

21:19.846 --> 21:21.413
Oh, you don't have
to explain, honey.

21:21.448 --> 21:24.916
This isn't
exactly
a surprise.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.252
Why not?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.689
Oh, well, identification
with mythical icons

21:29.721 --> 21:30.957
is perfectly typical

21:30.990 --> 21:32.258
of your age group.

21:32.290 --> 21:33.492
It's a-a classic

21:33.526 --> 21:34.926
adolescent response

21:34.961 --> 21:36.962
to the pressures of
incipient adulthood.

21:36.996 --> 21:40.266
Oh. Is that what it is?

21:40.298 --> 21:41.701
Of course, I wish you
could have identified

21:41.733 --> 21:43.269
with something
a little less icky,

21:43.301 --> 21:46.105
but developmentally
speaking...

21:46.137 --> 21:47.606
Mom, I'm not an age group.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.609
I'm me. Willow group.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.211
Oh, honey...

21:53.813 --> 21:55.213
I understand.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.115
No, you don't.

21:57.148 --> 22:01.453
Mom, this may be hard
for you to accept,

22:01.488 --> 22:03.221
but I can do stuff.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.124
Nothing bad
or dangerous,

22:05.156 --> 22:07.026
but I can do spells.

22:07.058 --> 22:08.294
You think you
can,

22:08.326 --> 22:10.162
and that's what concerns me.

22:10.195 --> 22:12.030
The delusions.

22:12.064 --> 22:15.000
Mom, how would you know
what I can do?

22:15.034 --> 22:18.538
I mean, the last time we had
a
conversation over three minutes,

22:18.570 --> 22:22.141
it was about the patriarchal
bias of the Mr. Rogers' show.

22:22.173 --> 22:23.576
Well, with King Friday

22:23.609 --> 22:25.076
lording it over
all
the lesser puppets...

22:25.111 --> 22:26.645
Mom, you're not
paying attention.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.815
And this is your way
of trying to get it.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.982
Now, I have consulted
with some of my colleagues,

22:31.017 --> 22:32.384
and they agree that

22:32.419 --> 22:35.086
this is a cry
for
discipline.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.722
You're grounded.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.324
Grounded?

22:38.356 --> 22:40.893
This is the first time, ever,

22:40.926 --> 22:43.695
I've done something you
don't like, and I'm grounded?

22:43.730 --> 22:46.833
I'm supposed to mess up.
I'm a teenager, remember?

22:46.865 --> 22:49.234
You're upset. I hear you.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.170
No, Ma, hear this.

22:51.202 --> 22:52.739
I'm a rebel.

22:52.771 --> 22:54.673
I'm having a rebellion.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.276
Willow, honey, you don't need
to act out like this

22:57.308 --> 22:59.045
to prove your specialness.

22:59.077 --> 23:01.580
Ma, I'm not acting out.
I'm a witch.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.950
I-I can make
pencils float.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.785
And I can summon
the four
elements.

23:05.817 --> 23:08.287
Okay, two, but four soon.

23:08.319 --> 23:11.057
And I'm dating a musician.

23:11.089 --> 23:12.558
Oh, Willow!

23:14.993 --> 23:16.628
I worship
Beelzebub.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.931
I do his
biddings.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.299
Do you see any goats around?
No, because I sacrificed
them.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.602
Willow,
please!

23:22.634 --> 23:24.570
All bow before Satan!

23:24.604 --> 23:26.204
I'm not listening to this.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.374
Prince of Night, I summon
you.

23:28.406 --> 23:31.277
Come fill me with your
black, naughty evil...

23:31.309 --> 23:32.211
That's enough!

23:32.243 --> 23:34.380
Is that clear?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.048
Now, you will go to your room

23:36.082 --> 23:38.484
and stay there until
I say otherwise.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.385
And we're
going
to make some changes.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.621
I don't want you

23:41.653 --> 23:43.422
hanging out with
those friends of yours.

23:43.455 --> 23:47.727
It's clear where this little
obsession came from.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.361
You will not
speak
to Bunny Summers again.

23:51.463 --> 23:53.265
I don't want you
seeing
that Willow anymore.

23:53.298 --> 23:55.401
I've
spoken
with her mother.

23:55.433 --> 23:58.471
I had no idea her forays
into the occult had gone so far.

23:58.505 --> 24:01.307
You're the one who ordered
the raid on the school today.

24:01.339 --> 24:03.576
Honey, they
opened
a few lockers.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.243
Lockers. First syllable, "lock."

24:05.277 --> 24:07.113
They're supposed to be private.

24:07.145 --> 24:08.847
And they took
all of Giles' books away.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.817
He'll get most of them back.

24:10.849 --> 24:13.653
MOO just wants to weed out
the offensive material.

24:13.685 --> 24:16.122
Everything else will be returned
to Mr. Giles
soon.

24:16.154 --> 24:18.790
If we're going to solve this,
we need those books now.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.760
Sweetie, those books
have no place

24:21.794 --> 24:23.461
in a public school library.

24:23.496 --> 24:24.696
Especially now.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.265
Any student
can
waltz in there

24:26.298 --> 24:28.601
and get all sorts
of ideas.

24:28.634 --> 24:32.672
Do you understand
how that terrifies me?

24:32.704 --> 24:35.007
(sighs)

24:35.040 --> 24:37.209
Mom, I hate that these people
scared you so much.

24:37.242 --> 24:39.345
And I-I know that you're
just trying to help,

24:39.377 --> 24:41.380
but you have to let me
handle this.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.682
It's what I do.

24:42.714 --> 24:44.115
But is it really?

24:44.150 --> 24:46.451
I mean, you
patrol,
you slay.

24:46.484 --> 24:49.888
Evil pops up, you undo it.
A-And that's great.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.191
But is Sunnydale
getting any
better?

24:52.223 --> 24:54.460
Are they running
out of vampires?

24:54.492 --> 24:56.796
I don't think
that
you run out of...

24:56.828 --> 24:58.029
It's not your fault.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.298
You don't have a plan.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.232
You just react to things.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.934
It's bound to be
kind of
fruitless.

25:05.605 --> 25:08.507
Okay, maybe I don't have a plan.

25:08.540 --> 25:09.842
Lord knows I don't have
lapel buttons.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.577
Buffy.
And maybe next time

25:11.611 --> 25:13.813
that the world is getting
sucked into hell,

25:13.846 --> 25:15.213
I won't be able to stop it,

25:15.247 --> 25:16.648
because
the anti-hell-sucking book

25:16.682 --> 25:18.517
isn't on the approved
reading list.

25:18.550 --> 25:21.587
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to put down...

25:21.621 --> 25:23.055
Yeah, well, you did.

25:23.088 --> 25:24.856
It doesn't
matter.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.925
I have to go.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.662
I have to go on one
of my pointless patrols

25:29.695 --> 25:32.198
and react to some vampires.

25:32.230 --> 25:34.032
If that's all right with MOO.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.338
And nice acronym, Mom.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.608
(door opens, then shuts)

25:42.642 --> 25:44.876
Just trying
to make things better.

25:47.479 --> 25:48.881
You
are.

25:48.914 --> 25:51.549
There's bad people
out there.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.853
BOY:
And we can't sleep.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.954
Not until you hurt them.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.990
BOY:
The way they hurt us.

26:07.398 --> 26:09.401
*

26:27.753 --> 26:29.520
Hey.
Hi.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.467
How are you?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.501
I'm all
right.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.938
I think I'm better
than you right now.

26:48.140 --> 26:51.743
I heard about this.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.246
People are talking.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.583
People are even
talking to me.

26:57.615 --> 26:59.818
It's strange.

26:59.852 --> 27:02.989
People die in Sunnydale
all the time...

27:03.021 --> 27:05.156
I've never seen
anything like this.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.961
They were children.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.263
Innocent.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.799
It makes a difference.

27:13.833 --> 27:17.836
And Mr. Sanderson from
the bank had it
coming?

27:21.039 --> 27:22.674
(sighs)

27:22.709 --> 27:25.845
My mom... said some things to me

27:25.877 --> 27:28.213
about being the slayer.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.182
That it's fruitless.

27:30.215 --> 27:31.817
No fruit for Buffy.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.384
She's
wrong.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.653
Is she?

27:35.688 --> 27:39.490
Is Sunnydale any better
than when I first came here?

27:39.525 --> 27:42.661
Okay, so I battle evil.

27:42.694 --> 27:45.131
But I don't really win.

27:45.163 --> 27:48.701
The bad keeps coming back
and getting stronger.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.302
Like the kid
in the story,

27:51.336 --> 27:53.138
the boy that stuck
his finger in the
duck.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.405
Dike.

27:55.406 --> 27:57.809
It's another word for dam.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.310
Oh.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.914
Okay, that story makes
a lot more sense now.

28:02.949 --> 28:05.483
Buffy, you know, I'm
still figuring things out.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.653
There's a lot
I don't understand.

28:08.686 --> 28:10.655
Hey...

28:10.689 --> 28:13.224
But I do know it's
important to keep fighting.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.594
I learned that from you.

28:17.730 --> 28:18.931
But we never...

28:18.964 --> 28:20.932
We never win.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.433
Not completely.

28:22.468 --> 28:23.701
Never will.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.571
That's not why we fight.

28:26.605 --> 28:29.375
We do it 'cause there's
things worth fighting for.

28:29.407 --> 28:32.443
Those kids. Their parents.

28:33.746 --> 28:36.048
Their parents.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.583
Look, I know
it's not much...

28:37.615 --> 28:38.851
No.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.788
No, it's a lot.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.192
(computer
beeping)
GILES:
Session interrupted?

28:46.224 --> 28:47.593
Who said you
could interrupt,

28:47.625 --> 28:50.195
you
stupid,
useless fad?

28:50.229 --> 28:51.697
No, I said
fad.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.098
And I'll say it again.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.902
At that point, I will
become frightened.

28:55.934 --> 28:58.203
OZ: Take
heart.
We found your books.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.071
You can put the heart
back. We can't get
them.

29:00.105 --> 29:01.807
They're locked up
in City Hall.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.809
"Frisky Watcher's Chat Room."

29:03.843 --> 29:05.743
Why, Giles!

29:05.778 --> 29:06.913
Oh, Buffy!
Oz and I found out...

29:06.945 --> 29:08.380
What do we
know
about these kids?

29:08.413 --> 29:09.615
What?

29:09.647 --> 29:11.083
Facts. Details.

29:11.116 --> 29:14.119
Well, they were, uh,
found in the park.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.721
No. Where did
they
go to school?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.624
Who were their parents?
What are their names?

29:18.656 --> 29:20.960
We know everything
about their
deaths,

29:20.992 --> 29:23.561
but we don't even know
their names.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.931
Well, sure we do.

29:24.963 --> 29:26.765
Um, it's on the tip
of my tongue.

29:26.798 --> 29:28.901
No, it never came up.
Ever.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.970
And if no one knows
who they are,

29:31.002 --> 29:32.971
where did these pictures
come from?

29:33.005 --> 29:34.772
I just assumed someone
had the details.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.775
I never really...

29:36.808 --> 29:38.144
Well, that is strange.

29:38.176 --> 29:40.445
We need to get
some information.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.580
Yeah, well, somebody else do it.
This thing's locked me out.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.849
Well, if you wouldn't
yell at it...

29:43.883 --> 29:45.284
I can look around,

29:45.317 --> 29:47.185
but Willow would really
know the sites we need.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.921
That's great.
She can't even
come to the phone.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.256
The wrath of MOO.

29:50.288 --> 29:51.789
Well, we don't need a phone.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.963
(computer chimes)

30:02.733 --> 30:04.435
All right,
we're linked.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.872
If anybody's
ID'd the
kids,

30:05.904 --> 30:08.473
she'll pull it up
and feed it here.

30:13.811 --> 30:16.015
GILES:
Mmm. "Two children found
dead.
Mysterious mark..."

30:16.048 --> 30:18.549
No, no. These
children were
found

30:18.584 --> 30:21.452
near Omaha in 1949.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.255
Yeah, they ain't ours.
Keep going.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.625
Wait.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.895
Those
are...

30:29.929 --> 30:31.396
BUFFY:
The same kids.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.765
50 years ago.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.236
"1899. Utah... two
children...

30:37.269 --> 30:39.505
Rural community torn
apart by suspicion."

30:39.538 --> 30:42.673
100 years ago. I mean,
how is this possible?

30:42.708 --> 30:44.375
There's no
mention
of who they were.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.345
They've never been
seen alive, just dead.

30:46.377 --> 30:48.747
A lot.

30:48.779 --> 30:50.749
Ah. There were
more articles.

30:50.781 --> 30:53.484
Every 50 years.
All the same.

30:53.519 --> 30:57.189
From as far back as 1649.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.457
Can I see that?

31:02.794 --> 31:04.163
Written by a cleric

31:04.195 --> 31:06.097
from a village
near the Black Forest.

31:06.132 --> 31:08.166
He found the bodies himself.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.169
Two children...

31:10.201 --> 31:11.403
Greta Strauss, age six.

31:11.436 --> 31:12.904
(typing)

31:12.939 --> 31:14.906
Hans Strauss, eight.

31:14.941 --> 31:17.709
So they have names.
That's new.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.346
Willow.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.713
I thought
I made myself clear.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.049
You're not minding me.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.616
Mom..

31:25.651 --> 31:27.019
I see what you're doing.
You're challenging me.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.921
But I will not have you
communicating

31:28.954 --> 31:31.522
with your cyber-coven
or what have you.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.192
Coven?

31:33.224 --> 31:36.427
What happened to me being
delusional and acting out?

31:36.461 --> 31:38.197
Well, that was before
I talked in depth

31:38.230 --> 31:40.898
with Ms. Summers
and her associates.

31:40.932 --> 31:43.769
It seems I've
been
rather close-minded.

31:43.801 --> 31:46.072
So, you believe me?

31:47.105 --> 31:48.807
I believe you, dear.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.844
Now all I can do
is let you go with love.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.913
Let me go?

31:55.948 --> 31:57.648
What does that mean?

31:59.451 --> 32:00.818
(lock clicks)

32:00.852 --> 32:02.153
Mom?

32:02.188 --> 32:04.655
GILES:
Uh, wait a minute.

32:04.690 --> 32:07.125
Uh... uh...

32:07.159 --> 32:09.760
There is a fringe theory

32:09.795 --> 32:11.163
held by a few folklorists

32:11.196 --> 32:13.432
that some regional stories

32:13.464 --> 32:15.767
have actual, um,

32:15.800 --> 32:18.670
very literal antecedents.

32:18.703 --> 32:20.939
And in some
language
that's English?

32:20.972 --> 32:22.974
Fairy tales are real.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.844
Hans and
Gre...

32:25.876 --> 32:27.479
Hansel and Gretel?

32:27.512 --> 32:30.249
Wait. Hansel and Gretel?

32:30.281 --> 32:32.917
Breadcrumbs, ovens,
gingerbread house?

32:32.951 --> 32:34.786
Of course.

32:34.819 --> 32:36.288
Well, it makes sense now.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.824
Yeah, it's all
falling into place.

32:38.856 --> 32:41.326
Of course, that place
is nowhere near this place.

32:41.359 --> 32:43.328
Some demons
thrive

32:43.362 --> 32:46.597
by fostering hatred
and, uh, persecution

32:46.632 --> 32:48.000
amongst the mortal animals.

32:48.034 --> 32:50.269
Not by...
not by destroying men,

32:50.301 --> 32:52.637
but by watching men
destroy each other.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.306
They feed us our darkest fear

32:54.339 --> 32:58.277
and turn peaceful communities
into vigilantes.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.810
Hansel and Gretel run
home to tell everyone

32:59.845 --> 33:01.313
about the mean old witch.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.848
And then she--
and probably dozens of others--

33:03.882 --> 33:05.851
are persecuted
by a righteous mob.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.318
It's happened
all throughout history.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.954
It happened in Salem,
not surprisingly.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.457
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm still
spinning

33:11.490 --> 33:13.259
on this whole
"fairy tales are real" thing.

33:14.593 --> 33:15.993
So what do we do?

33:16.028 --> 33:17.628
I don't know about you,

33:17.663 --> 33:21.200
but I'm going to go trade my cow
in for some
beans.

33:21.232 --> 33:23.169
No one else is seeing
the funny here, huh?

33:23.201 --> 33:24.403
Giles, we need
to talk to
Mom.

33:24.435 --> 33:25.671
If she knows the
truth,

33:25.703 --> 33:27.405
she can defuse
the whole thing.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.342
What happened?

33:30.375 --> 33:31.843
I was
attacked.

33:31.876 --> 33:33.211
Officially not funny.

33:33.244 --> 33:34.145
By whom?

33:34.180 --> 33:35.681
My dad. His friends.

33:35.713 --> 33:36.981
They're taking people
out of their homes.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.151
They're
talking
about a trial,

33:39.184 --> 33:40.385
down at City Hall.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.552
They got Amy.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.088
Michael, stay
here and hide.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.390
Giles,
we'll
go find my mom.
Willow...

33:44.423 --> 33:46.092
Tell her to
get
out of her house!

33:46.125 --> 33:47.393
Stay in my office.

33:50.895 --> 33:52.597
(door unlocks)

33:53.798 --> 33:55.334
Mom, we really have to
talk...

33:55.366 --> 33:56.867
Time to go.

33:56.902 --> 33:58.737
Oh, and get your coat.
It's chilly out.

33:58.769 --> 34:00.506
Go? Go where?

34:00.538 --> 34:01.772
I said get your coat, witch!

34:03.608 --> 34:05.576
(banging on door)

34:05.611 --> 34:07.212
Did you speak to the families
on Sycamore Street?

34:07.246 --> 34:09.481
Yes, I did.
Great

34:11.150 --> 34:12.918
Buffy. Mr. Giles.

34:12.951 --> 34:14.686
Did something happen?
Mom, we need
to talk to you.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.088
Now.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.356
Well, of course, honey.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.889
Um, go on without me.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.293
No, we need
to talk alone.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.396
Look, there's
more to this than we...

34:24.429 --> 34:27.666
(muffled yelling)

34:30.735 --> 34:33.304
You were right.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.106
It was easy.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.041
I told you.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.244
It gets even easier.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.880
GIRL:
But I'm still scared
of the bad girls.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.547
BOY:
You have to stop them.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.985
You have to make
them go
away...

34:47.018 --> 34:48.420
forever.

34:56.327 --> 34:57.628
Willow!

35:11.143 --> 35:12.344
SHEILA:
Hold still.

35:12.378 --> 35:13.612
Be a good
girl.

35:13.644 --> 35:16.581
No! Why are you
doing this to me?

35:16.614 --> 35:18.416
Mom?

35:18.449 --> 35:20.018
There's no cure
but the fire.

35:20.050 --> 35:21.452
Buffy!

35:21.487 --> 35:22.987
Wake up!

35:23.021 --> 35:24.956
This is crazy, Mom.

35:24.989 --> 35:26.692
AMY:
Buffy!

35:26.724 --> 35:28.659
Buffy!

35:28.693 --> 35:30.061
CORDELIA:
Wake up!

35:36.367 --> 35:37.835
Cordelia?

35:37.869 --> 35:39.704
Took you long enough
to wake
up.

35:39.737 --> 35:41.840
My hand hurts.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.675
Pity.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.177
Oh. Why are you here?

35:45.210 --> 35:47.278
Things are way out
of control, Giles.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.047
First the
thing
at school,

35:49.079 --> 35:51.016
and then my
mom
confiscate

35:51.048 --> 35:53.351
all of my black
clothes
and scented candles.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.387
I came over here
to tell Buffy

35:55.420 --> 35:56.954
to stop this craziness

35:56.987 --> 35:59.690
and found you all
unconscious... again.

35:59.724 --> 36:01.893
How many times have
you
been knocked out, anyway?

36:01.927 --> 36:04.028
I swear, one
of
these
times

36:04.061 --> 36:05.664
you're going
to
wake up in a coma.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.867
Wake up in a...
Oh, never mind.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.836
We need to save Buffy
from Hansel and Gretel.

36:12.903 --> 36:14.672
Now, let's be clear.

36:14.706 --> 36:18.344
The brain damage happened
before I hit you.

36:18.376 --> 36:20.878
*

36:20.911 --> 36:24.148
(indistinct chatter)

36:24.181 --> 36:25.384
What's with the grim?

36:25.416 --> 36:27.385
We're here
to join you guys.

36:27.418 --> 36:29.887
No,
really.
Why should you
guys
have all the fun?

36:29.920 --> 36:33.224
We want to be part
of the hate.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.159
Just so we're clear, you guys
know you're nuts, right?

36:35.193 --> 36:38.195
(men shouting indistinctly)

36:39.764 --> 36:41.166
Buffy!

36:41.199 --> 36:43.168
Good morning,
sleepyhead

36:43.201 --> 36:45.371
Mom, you don't want this.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.038
Since when does it
matter what I
want?

36:47.072 --> 36:48.873
I wanted a normal,
happy
daughter.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.476
Instead,
I got a
slayer.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.445
(grunting)

36:54.480 --> 36:55.681
Torch.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.047
Thanks.

36:57.081 --> 36:58.384
This has been
so trying.

36:58.416 --> 36:59.885
You've
been
such a champ.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.387
Oh, you, too, Joyce.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.922
We should stay close,
have
lunch.

37:03.954 --> 37:06.257
Oh, I'd like that.
How nice.

37:07.425 --> 37:09.193
Oh, you can't be serious.

37:09.226 --> 37:10.896
Mom, don't!

37:18.304 --> 37:20.938
All right.
You want to fry a witch?

37:20.972 --> 37:23.208
I'll give you a witch.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.610
Goddess Hecate,

37:24.643 --> 37:26.945
work thy will.
Uh-oh.

37:26.978 --> 37:31.849
Before thee let
the unclean thing crawl.

37:39.858 --> 37:40.826
MAN:
Oh

37:40.858 --> 37:42.494
(uneasy chatter)

37:42.527 --> 37:44.262
Uh...

37:44.295 --> 37:46.030
(rat squeaking)

37:48.800 --> 37:50.768
She couldn't do us first?

37:50.802 --> 37:52.503
You've seen what we can do.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.306
Another step

37:54.340 --> 37:56.273
and you will all feel my power.

37:56.307 --> 37:59.177
What are you going to do,
float a pencil at them?

37:59.210 --> 38:01.947
It's a really big power.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.483
BUFFY:
Yes! You will all be
turned into vermin.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.753
And some of you
will be fish.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.521
Yeah, you in the back
will be fish.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.523
Maybe we should go.

38:12.557 --> 38:13.824
But you promised.

38:13.858 --> 38:17.061
You have to
kill
the bad
girls.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.030
CORDELIA:
I can't believe

38:20.065 --> 38:21.867
you had this stuff
in your apartment.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.268
It smells foul.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.938
Shred the wolfsbane.
That's the, uh, the leafy stuff.

38:26.972 --> 38:30.509
And then you can crush
the, uh, satyrion root.

38:30.541 --> 38:34.311
Luften sie den... something.

38:34.346 --> 38:36.681
Schlumer? Schluter?

38:36.715 --> 38:37.983
What are you muttering about?

38:38.016 --> 38:39.451
It's a part of an
incantation.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.519
It's in German,
and without my books...

38:41.552 --> 38:42.820
What does it
mean?

38:42.853 --> 38:44.822
It's about, uh, lifting a veil.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.793
It should make the demons appear
in their true form,

38:48.827 --> 38:51.697
which, with any luck, will, uh,
negate their influence.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.864
And, uh, drop a toadstone
into the mixture.

38:53.898 --> 38:56.568
This?

38:56.601 --> 38:58.403
It doesn't look like a toad.

38:58.436 --> 39:00.204
No reason it should.

39:00.237 --> 39:01.806
It's from inside the toad.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.010
I hate you.

39:09.246 --> 39:11.349
We got to get inside.

39:11.382 --> 39:13.351
WILLOW:
No! Oh, God, help!

39:15.219 --> 39:16.755
Will?

39:16.788 --> 39:19.356
It sounds like she's
right... above us?

39:38.043 --> 39:39.244
GIRL:
They hurt us.

39:39.277 --> 39:41.112
BOY
Burn them.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.581
Mom, dead people
are talking to you.

39:43.614 --> 39:44.916
Do the math.

39:44.949 --> 39:46.952
I'm sorry, Buffy.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.353
Mom, look at me!
You love me.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.356
You're not going to be able

39:51.389 --> 39:53.023
to live with yourself
if you do this.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.259
JOYCE:
You earned this.

39:54.291 --> 39:57.695
You toyed with unnatural forces.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.530
What kind of a mother would I be

39:59.565 --> 40:01.166
if I didn't punish you?

40:08.273 --> 40:10.275
(indistinct shouting)

40:11.742 --> 40:14.579
Ouch! You got hair with that.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.315
God, you really were

40:17.347 --> 40:18.650
the little youthful
offender, weren't you?

40:18.684 --> 40:20.719
You must just look back

40:20.751 --> 40:22.119
on that and cringe.

40:22.152 --> 40:23.688
Shh!

40:33.498 --> 40:35.967
Buffy, I can't take it.
It's too hot.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.135
I'm sorry, Will.
If it wasn't for me,

40:38.168 --> 40:40.237
none of this
would have happened.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.106
It wouldn't be...

40:47.978 --> 40:49.347
Stop them!

40:49.380 --> 40:51.516
(Giles reciting incantation
in German)

40:56.722 --> 40:57.956
CORDELIA:
Do you like that? Huh?
How 'bout some more?

40:57.989 --> 41:00.324
Buffy, I'm on fire!

41:00.358 --> 41:02.260
Cordelia, put out the fire!

41:02.293 --> 41:04.295
Oh, right.

41:27.085 --> 41:28.719
(Giles speaking
German)

41:32.222 --> 41:33.858
(sizzling)

41:50.208 --> 41:52.710
(growling)

41:52.744 --> 41:55.179
Okay, I think I liked
the two little ones

41:55.213 --> 41:57.548
more than the one big one.

42:01.418 --> 42:04.021
Oh, my God!

42:04.054 --> 42:05.556
Protect us.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.726
Kill the bad girls.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.161
You know what?

42:11.195 --> 42:13.364
Not as convincing
in that outfit.

42:13.398 --> 42:14.900
(roars)

42:17.068 --> 42:18.268
(wood snaps)

42:18.302 --> 42:20.606
(squishing sound)

42:21.873 --> 42:25.610
Did I get it? Did I get it?

42:27.445 --> 42:28.780
Aah!
(crash)

42:33.784 --> 42:36.420
We're here to save you.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.858
Your mom doesn't mind us
doing this in the house?

42:40.891 --> 42:42.760
She doesn't know.

42:42.793 --> 42:44.262
Business as usual?

42:44.295 --> 42:46.030
Yeah, sort of.

42:46.063 --> 42:47.431
She's doing that
selective memory thing

42:47.465 --> 42:49.199
your mom used to
be
so good
at.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.036
She forgot everything?

42:51.068 --> 42:53.403
No. She remembered
the part

42:53.438 --> 42:55.740
where I said
I was dating a musician.

42:55.773 --> 42:58.076
Oz has to come
for dinner next week.

42:58.108 --> 43:00.646
So, that's sort of like
taking an interest.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.315
Okay, should we
try this again?

43:04.349 --> 43:05.751
Let's do it.

43:05.784 --> 43:08.820
I think we got the mix of herbs
right this time.

43:08.853 --> 43:10.789
Okay. Ready?

43:10.822 --> 43:12.657
(match striking)

43:12.690 --> 43:14.458
Willow:
Diana, Hecate,

43:14.492 --> 43:18.128
I hereby license thee
to depart.

43:18.163 --> 43:19.597
Goddess of creatures
great and small,

43:19.630 --> 43:22.032
I conjure thee to withdraw.

43:26.371 --> 43:28.773
(squeaking)

43:35.512 --> 43:38.615
Maybe we should get her
one of those wheel thingies.

44:15.186 --> 44:17.588
Grr. Argh.
