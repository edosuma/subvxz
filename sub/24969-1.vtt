WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.167
Hey, check out
the Wurlitzer!

00:03.251 --> 00:05.542
How 'bout a bit of
Australiana, eh?

00:11.667 --> 00:14.167
This is
the Drumtastic 9000.

00:14.251 --> 00:16.751
Auto chords. Yeah, baby!

00:19.751 --> 00:21.417
And now for my big finish -

00:21.501 --> 00:23.209
fire up the Leslie
and the subwoofer.

00:25.334 --> 00:27.584
Hey, Gale!
Did you hear any of that?

00:29.667 --> 00:32.834
The whole thing's
just dynamite!

00:34.751 --> 00:37.084
Oh, I wonder what the poor
people are doing today.

00:37.209 --> 00:39.501
Oh, no, you've gotta screw
deeper. You gotta screw deeper.

00:39.584 --> 00:41.376
- She'll be right.
- Here. Hold this.

00:41.459 --> 00:43.626
Oh, here we go
with the umbrella business!

00:43.709 --> 00:45.792
He's parasol paranoid,
I'm telling you.

00:45.876 --> 00:47.334
Terrified of umbrellas.

00:50.209 --> 00:53.001
What the hell
happened in the 1970s?

00:53.084 --> 00:55.667
A decade with too much time,
too much money

00:55.751 --> 00:58.001
and way too much cask wine
on its hands.

00:58.251 --> 00:59.417
Stop.

00:59.501 --> 01:00.792
Thanks to a birthday present

01:00.876 --> 01:02.667
that would go on to make me
a dishonest living,

01:02.751 --> 01:06.334
I captured everything
in the hope that one day

01:06.417 --> 01:08.042
I could edit
the madness together

01:08.126 --> 01:09.542
and answer the question -

01:09.834 --> 01:13.709
what was going through
our poor misguided heads?

01:14.001 --> 01:16.876
My big home movies
starred a bunch of ratbags

01:16.959 --> 01:20.209
who all lived on the same
block - Wyong Place.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.334
Wedged in time somewhere

01:23.417 --> 01:25.626
between Penny Lane
and Wall Street,

01:25.709 --> 01:28.917
meet three rudderless families
who lived, surfed

01:29.001 --> 01:31.959
and spectacularly
crossed the line together.

01:32.251 --> 01:33.917
A lot of people to meet
in the next few minutes,

01:34.001 --> 01:35.459
but it's not a test.

01:35.709 --> 01:37.459
Just enjoy the slideshow.

01:37.542 --> 01:40.042
One, two, three.

01:40.126 --> 01:42.126
Open your eyes.

01:42.209 --> 01:43.876
Rack off!

01:43.959 --> 01:47.626
The Hall house was
a disaster movie in the making.

01:47.709 --> 01:50.667
Gerome Hall was
the coolest kid in school.

01:52.334 --> 01:55.042
He was also my stuntman.

02:02.042 --> 02:03.459
And cut!

02:03.542 --> 02:05.542
If this water goes pink again,
I'm gonna cop it!

02:05.792 --> 02:07.501
We're fucking on it,
alright?!

02:07.584 --> 02:09.917
- Die! Die!
- No, don't! Stop!

02:10.209 --> 02:12.126
Arggh!

02:12.417 --> 02:15.126
Gerome's dad couldn't win
an egg and spoon race.

02:15.209 --> 02:16.834
Keith Hall rapped
his knuckles raw

02:16.917 --> 02:18.542
trying to feed
six hungry mouths

02:18.626 --> 02:20.376
with nothing between him
and their next meal

02:20.459 --> 02:22.167
but a mangy encyclopedia.

02:22.251 --> 02:24.209
Are you dreaming of
a better world?

02:24.292 --> 02:27.292
I'm Keith Hall from
Funk & Wagnalls Encyclopedias.

02:27.542 --> 02:28.667
Yours to take home

02:28.751 --> 02:30.626
with only the common cents
jingling in your pocket.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.834
With every overly abundant
currency vestibule,

02:33.917 --> 02:35.876
you'll receive
the next gold-embossed,

02:35.959 --> 02:38.292
cliff-hanging tome
that will be delivered...

02:38.376 --> 02:42.001
Gerome! I'm on a bloody call
with Mrs Darlington of Dapto!

02:43.751 --> 02:45.459
Kaye, my sweet?

02:46.917 --> 02:48.834
Please set the table
for luncheon.

02:48.917 --> 02:51.167
With her husband
going pink in the wash

02:51.251 --> 02:53.667
and her kids' hair
going green in the pool,

02:53.751 --> 02:55.376
Kaye Hall didn't leave
the house much.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.917
Agoraphobia, like skin cancer
and political correctness,

02:59.001 --> 03:00.501
hadn't been invented yet.

03:00.751 --> 03:02.501
Mum!

03:02.584 --> 03:03.626
Kaye and Keith were

03:03.709 --> 03:06.584
the sunburnt centrefolds
of Nobby's Beach.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.751
Then...a light went out.

03:10.042 --> 03:11.834
Keith turned to classy
porn magazines

03:11.917 --> 03:14.042
like Inspect-Her Gadget,

03:14.126 --> 03:16.834
and Kaye turned to drink
with a deafening silence.

03:16.917 --> 03:18.167
Action!

03:22.376 --> 03:23.959
Keira Hall loved the water

03:24.042 --> 03:26.001
and bluebottles loved her back.

03:26.084 --> 03:28.251
That's 'cause her dad said
she was special.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.167
Not quite the full quid,
are ya?

03:31.542 --> 03:33.959
But you are Daddy's favourite.
You will come good.

03:35.959 --> 03:38.417
But they're black ones.
I don't like black ones.

03:38.709 --> 03:40.834
Nobody likes
the black ones, love.

03:45.084 --> 03:47.292
Nah, that was terrible.
You're going down there...

03:47.376 --> 03:49.084
OW!

03:49.167 --> 03:53.042
Ow! Unfair, Liam Jones!
That really hurt!

03:53.334 --> 03:56.167
Not as much as it's gonna!
Suck eggs, grogans!

03:58.376 --> 04:00.751
If the Jones boys
were gonna experiment,

04:00.834 --> 04:02.626
they may as well do it at home.

04:02.917 --> 04:05.376
So said their parents,
Rick and Jo Jones.

04:07.834 --> 04:09.459
They said Rick Jones was
the most fun you could have

04:09.542 --> 04:10.792
with your pants on.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.042
Somebody's gonna get hurt
and it's not gonna be me!

04:13.334 --> 04:15.834
The Joneses were
the big kahunas on the block -

04:16.125 --> 04:18.625
the biggest house,
the biggest car

04:18.916 --> 04:21.084
and the biggest hair.

04:21.375 --> 04:24.376
Rick sold drugs -
groundbreaking drugs,

04:24.459 --> 04:26.042
like tanning tablets
and Valium.

04:26.126 --> 04:27.334
Drugs that made their way

04:27.417 --> 04:29.709
straight into the gob
of his wife.

04:29.792 --> 04:33.084
Jo owned a specialist
travel agency.

04:33.251 --> 04:35.126
Travel Exotica.

04:36.751 --> 04:39.292
She didn't have to work.
She chose to.

04:39.376 --> 04:41.459
Tahiti looks nice.

04:41.542 --> 04:44.376
Simon? Tahiti!

04:44.667 --> 04:46.542
Jo knew the world was changing

04:46.626 --> 04:48.584
and she didn't want to miss
the gravy boat.

04:48.709 --> 04:51.042
Let 'em learn the hard way.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.126
Naaaaahhh!

04:58.917 --> 05:01.084
If you had to pick
a superpower -

05:01.167 --> 05:02.792
to fly or be invisible -

05:02.876 --> 05:04.167
which would it be?

05:04.709 --> 05:07.626
The first great love
of my life, Melissa Jones,

05:07.709 --> 05:09.542
chose invisibility.

05:09.626 --> 05:12.334
She was the lost girl
that only I could see.

05:14.626 --> 05:16.542
Our fates were sealed
by secrets so terrible

05:16.626 --> 05:18.542
nobody dared talk about it.

05:18.626 --> 05:22.167
We were the first generation to
wear fully synthetic fabrics.

05:23.376 --> 05:25.876
We were also...the last.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.542
Shit!

05:29.626 --> 05:31.334
Oh, my goodness!
The kids!

05:34.459 --> 05:38.209
That famous election night
left us both scarred for life.

05:38.292 --> 05:41.667
Melly and I were
the flammable children.

05:41.751 --> 05:43.626
If Melly Jones picked
invisibility,

05:43.709 --> 05:46.209
I, Jeff Marsh, chose flight.

05:46.292 --> 05:48.042
One, two, three.

05:48.709 --> 05:50.834
Not too hot, not too cold.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.792
My family was stuck

05:52.876 --> 05:54.792
right in the middle
of the cul-de-sac.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.084
For cryin' out loud, Gerome!

05:56.167 --> 05:58.334
You're soarin'
poor bloody Sandy!

05:58.417 --> 06:00.042
Mr Marsh, you're gonna need
a bigger boat.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.834
Nick off, will you?

06:01.917 --> 06:05.584
My dad, Bob Marsh, loved
playing the organ - badly.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.459
He worked for a successful
American gadget importer -

06:08.542 --> 06:09.751
K-Tel.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.709
Order now and you'll receive
a bonus set of steak knives

06:11.792 --> 06:13.542
absolutely free!

06:21.209 --> 06:24.292
Needless to say, there were
no surprises on Christmas Day.

06:24.376 --> 06:26.001
Gee, you shouldn't have.

06:26.084 --> 06:27.959
Trace-0-Matic Mark 2!

06:28.042 --> 06:30.042
Uh-oh. Foot odour.

06:30.126 --> 06:32.417
Oh, here she comes.
Welcome, Sleeping Beauty.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.501
Oh, I wonder who this is for.
Oh, it's for me!

06:34.584 --> 06:36.334
Thank you, darling.

06:37.792 --> 06:40.626
Not on the carpet! It stains.

06:40.709 --> 06:44.126
But wait - there's more!

06:44.209 --> 06:45.876
Hey, Mum?

06:45.959 --> 06:48.667
- I'm talking to the girls!
- Mum!

06:48.751 --> 06:50.667
Clean your room!
The cleaner's coming!

06:50.751 --> 06:52.376
Let's go.

06:52.459 --> 06:54.376
My dear mum, Gale,
was outgoing.

06:54.459 --> 06:56.292
She kept herself busy doing...

06:56.376 --> 06:59.084
...well, actually, we don't
really know what she did,

06:59.167 --> 07:01.542
but we did know that she loved
three things especially.

07:01.626 --> 07:03.459
You cannot be serious!

07:03.542 --> 07:05.417
Tennis, shopping and chatter.

07:05.501 --> 07:07.251
I mean, John McEnroe!

07:07.334 --> 07:09.959
My big sister, Bec,
was also 'outgoing'.

07:10.042 --> 07:13.084
The family doctor said
she was very...active.

07:18.084 --> 07:20.292
Evonne Goolagong
is an Aboriginal.

07:20.376 --> 07:22.001
She's just a young native.

07:22.084 --> 07:26.251
But she's just fucking gold!
It's extraordinary.

07:26.334 --> 07:28.626
After the boredom of
a six-hour shopping marathon,

07:28.709 --> 07:30.542
Kmart kryptonite appeared

07:30.626 --> 07:33.917
in the form of important,
life-changing foreign cinema.

07:34.001 --> 07:36.001
Come on down
and chum some of this shit!

07:42.667 --> 07:44.876
That stupid shopping centre
gave me something

07:44.959 --> 07:46.584
I didn't even know
I was getting -

07:46.667 --> 07:48.126
an education.

07:49.084 --> 07:50.584
My superpower exploded

07:50.667 --> 07:53.459
in the form of a mighty
Super 8 camera.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.542
I was armed with a weapon
so powerful

07:55.626 --> 07:58.292
I could make boys like Gerome
do anything I wanted.

08:02.667 --> 08:05.042
And these three families
collided every weekend

08:05.126 --> 08:08.001
in the sand that
time and taste forgot.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.074

08:41.751 --> 08:43.376
Bluebottles in the water!

08:45.626 --> 08:47.584
Want a top-up, ladies?

08:47.667 --> 08:50.459
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, yes, please!

08:50.542 --> 08:51.751
Oh, you've gotta love
a wine box.

08:51.834 --> 08:53.501
You never know
how much you've drunk!

08:53.584 --> 08:57.417
Well, you know what they say,
don't you? A happy wife...

08:57.501 --> 08:59.209
A happy, long life.

09:06.876 --> 09:09.292
Ooh, mate. That's good.

09:09.376 --> 09:11.084
That's good.

09:19.417 --> 09:22.751
Rooster? Sweetie, could you
pick that up for me?

09:22.834 --> 09:24.917
- Oh, sure, no worries, Mrs J.
- Ooh!

09:32.834 --> 09:34.751
Now we know why they call it
baby oil.

09:36.626 --> 09:38.501
Yeah, you could pop it
in the oven.

09:48.376 --> 09:50.167
Eat as much as you can, boys.

09:52.126 --> 09:54.209
Kentucky Fried Crumble!

09:55.417 --> 09:57.126
Boys, get in!

10:02.376 --> 10:05.626
Don't do that, boys!
You know they're deadly.

10:07.709 --> 10:11.959
Muuuummm!

10:13.459 --> 10:16.626
Muuummm!

10:16.709 --> 10:19.792
Urine counteracts. Toilets!

10:19.876 --> 10:21.501
- No! Please don't pee on me!
- Come on!

10:21.584 --> 10:23.292
Please don't pee on me again!

10:47.001 --> 10:49.084
No! No going in the water

10:49.167 --> 10:51.376
till the whole drumstick
goes down, alright?

10:51.459 --> 10:54.542
Oh, stop being a water Nazi.

10:54.626 --> 10:56.542
Go on. Off you go.
Knock yourself out.

10:56.626 --> 10:58.251
Love you, Dad!

11:09.751 --> 11:10.751
What now?

11:11.667 --> 11:12.751
What's wrong?

11:13.751 --> 11:15.834
Oh, go see what she's done now.

11:15.917 --> 11:18.292
What's the down low?

11:18.376 --> 11:21.292
Give us a look. Come on.

11:27.959 --> 11:29.876
Quit your whining! Cut it!

11:29.959 --> 11:31.251
I said cut it!

11:31.834 --> 11:33.792
If you don't quit your whining,
you're gonna cop a hiding!

11:33.876 --> 11:35.959
Rick? Deal with it!

11:36.042 --> 11:37.667
- You understand?
- Rick!

11:37.751 --> 11:39.501
Come here!

11:40.501 --> 11:42.501
Bloody embarrassing!
Come on, get in the car!

11:43.542 --> 11:45.876
Bag of chips
and a pink lemonade.

11:45.959 --> 11:48.209
And have a good think about
the starving Africans!

11:48.292 --> 11:50.542
The best days of our lives.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.001
Am I rewriting history?
Probably.

11:53.084 --> 11:54.751
'Cause God knows
our parents did.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.459
Attention, all Death Cheaters.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.417
Camera's up.
Let's grab the gear.

11:58.501 --> 12:02.042
Boys! Zinc on noses!
Skin cancer!

12:02.126 --> 12:04.251
Oh! Don't be ridiculous!

12:05.542 --> 12:07.251
Blister!

12:20.709 --> 12:22.334
Arggh!

12:22.417 --> 12:24.042
Fuckin' bluebottles!

12:24.126 --> 12:26.126
And they really fucking hurt!

12:26.209 --> 12:29.459
- Suck eggs!
- Mum is gonna piss on you!

12:29.542 --> 12:33.001
Hey! Do you want the Chiko
Rolls and Sunny Boys or not?

12:33.084 --> 12:34.792
Death Cheaters, attack!

12:37.709 --> 12:41.542
I've only got 11 seconds of
film left. Stop mucking around!

12:42.417 --> 12:43.959
I always wanted to be
a filmmaker.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.292
My problem was a plot.

12:47.376 --> 12:50.084
Australia and I were hopelessly
bobbing around the Pacific

12:50.167 --> 12:51.626
looking for a direction.

12:51.709 --> 12:53.792
Whale! Whale!

12:53.876 --> 12:55.084
Whale!

12:55.584 --> 12:57.334
I AM wailing!

12:58.042 --> 12:59.417
And thanks to a full moon

12:59.501 --> 13:01.584
and the king tide
that followed,

13:01.667 --> 13:03.042
I finally found one.

13:03.126 --> 13:04.834
Ow, ow, ow!

13:04.917 --> 13:06.292
Go get the camera!

13:06.376 --> 13:08.334
Come here!
Look at the whale!

13:09.959 --> 13:11.251
Look at this!

13:11.334 --> 13:12.626
Come check it out!

13:15.876 --> 13:18.042
The great blue whale.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.501
This is bigger than Ben-Hur.

13:22.334 --> 13:25.084
Go! Come on!
Let's go, go, go! Go!

13:25.167 --> 13:26.917
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow!

13:28.292 --> 13:31.209
Dad, grab the zoom.
This is humungous.

13:31.292 --> 13:32.917
Wh...?

13:33.001 --> 13:35.792
Residents of
this sleepy seaside suburb

13:35.876 --> 13:38.584
awoke to a new, blue
tourist attraction.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.626
Wallaroo locals are flocking
to see the dead whale,

13:41.709 --> 13:44.459
much to the delight of
schoolkids, seniors

13:44.542 --> 13:46.376
and salivating seagulls.

13:49.042 --> 13:50.834
It's a whale!

13:50.917 --> 13:52.709
And it's fucking
on the beach!

13:52.792 --> 13:55.209
Not fucking on the
beach, on the fucking beach.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.501
And stop fuckin' swearing!

13:56.584 --> 13:58.834
You're not bringing a whale
home. I'll tell you right now.

13:58.917 --> 14:02.042
This mullet has ruined
a perfectly good day!

14:02.126 --> 14:03.751
Ruined? Nah.

14:03.834 --> 14:06.001
I reckon he's gonna put
Wallaroo on the map.

14:06.084 --> 14:08.001
He's a real live dead whale.

14:08.084 --> 14:10.251
Him? I didn't see a penis.

14:10.334 --> 14:12.834
- I think he's a ripper!
- I think he's revolting!

14:12.917 --> 14:14.667
And I think
I'd better get a photo.

14:14.751 --> 14:16.584
OK, everybody,
looking at the sun.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.292
Come on, come on!

14:18.376 --> 14:20.167
Big smiles. That's it.

14:20.251 --> 14:23.667
Everyone ready?
One, two, three, and...

14:23.751 --> 14:25.417
Hang on a minute.

14:25.501 --> 14:27.126
Come on, mate!

14:27.209 --> 14:30.542
Looking up at the sun!
One, two, three, and...

14:30.626 --> 14:32.251
Hang on a minute.

14:32.334 --> 14:34.792
- Come on, Dad!
- Here we go.

14:34.876 --> 14:37.584
One...two...three...

14:40.334 --> 14:41.334
Brilliant.

14:45.126 --> 14:48.209
Ooh, clean bowled him!
Brilliant. Bowled by Lillee.

14:48.292 --> 14:50.876
Would you like an ice-cream,
little girl?

14:52.126 --> 14:54.167
I'm not allowed
to talk to strangers.

15:00.417 --> 15:02.209
Have a look at the whale!

15:05.876 --> 15:07.626
Thank Christ
we got a park, darl.

15:09.126 --> 15:11.084
Melly, come see.
This is ginormous.

15:11.167 --> 15:12.834
I told you
to stay in the car

15:12.917 --> 15:14.542
or you'd cop a hiding,
young lady!

15:14.626 --> 15:16.334
Oh, don't be a bully,
darling.

15:23.917 --> 15:26.126
And on behalf of
the Wallaroo Council,

15:26.209 --> 15:28.792
I'd like to welcome
our strange visitor

15:28.876 --> 15:30.584
and congratulate him

15:30.667 --> 15:32.917
on his fine choice
of holiday destination.

15:34.709 --> 15:36.334
You got loose change
in your Speedos?

15:36.417 --> 15:38.501
Why not invest in
a Funk and Wagnalls...

15:38.584 --> 15:39.959
She's crying.

15:40.042 --> 15:42.792
Yeah, well, of course she's
crying, you idiot. She's dead!

15:42.876 --> 15:44.501
- Hey, cork it, Liam!
- Oh, yeah?

15:44.584 --> 15:46.876
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna film me to death?

15:48.667 --> 15:50.376
You lightweight
hammerhead!

15:50.459 --> 15:52.376
Looks like you might have
found yourself a plot, tiger.

15:52.459 --> 15:54.917
It's got a beginning, a middle
and an end.

15:57.876 --> 16:00.417
Oh!

16:00.501 --> 16:02.751
Bloody hell.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.459
Oh, I think I'm gonna hurl!

16:04.542 --> 16:06.709
This is revolting!

16:07.334 --> 16:09.001
Maybe we should take
a raincheck on tonight.

16:09.084 --> 16:11.001
What? No.

16:11.084 --> 16:12.751
We've been planning this
evening for months.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.626
I'm not giving it up
for. . . Flipper.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.334
- No.
- No.

16:16.417 --> 16:19.126
Righto! Dinner - Chateau Jones.

16:19.209 --> 16:21.584
Got a little surprise for you
boys!

16:21.667 --> 16:24.876
Oh, Christ, we'd better beat
the traffic! Come on! Let's go!

16:27.042 --> 16:28.751
- Quit your bloody whingeing!
- Ow, ow!

16:28.834 --> 16:30.751
- I'm not going tonight.
- It's just a dinner party!

16:30.834 --> 16:32.459
Get us to the bank!

16:32.542 --> 16:34.167
We're gonna starve
like Africans.

16:34.251 --> 16:35.876
Righto, righto. Enough.

16:35.959 --> 16:37.584
That's where you're going.
In the back.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.501
- It's hot in there!
- Ow, ow! Ow, ow!

16:39.584 --> 16:41.959
Dad, your ciggie
hit me in the boobs!

16:42.042 --> 16:45.334
Get out, smelly. Couldn't get
a fuck in a frankfurt factory.

16:50.917 --> 16:55.917
Balaenoptera musculus -
the great blue whale.

16:56.001 --> 16:59.126
It's the largest animal
ever known to have existed.

16:59.209 --> 17:02.459
Melissa!
We have guests coming!

17:02.542 --> 17:05.626
If you think you can embarrass
me more than twice in a row,

17:05.709 --> 17:07.376
you've got another thing
coming!

17:24.334 --> 17:26.209
Mum, what's with
the Sportsgirl white?

17:26.291 --> 17:27.916
It's not a special occasion.

17:28.001 --> 17:29.626
Oh, mind
your own business!

17:29.709 --> 17:31.334
Bob? Do I look alright?

17:31.417 --> 17:33.042
Yeah, you look fine.

17:33.126 --> 17:34.751
Party time!

17:34.834 --> 17:36.459
Oh, Keith, be a doll
and carry that up, will you?

17:36.542 --> 17:38.209
- Oh. Look at that.
- Thank you.

17:38.292 --> 17:39.959
Pineapple explosion!

17:42.834 --> 17:45.584
Well, the boys bring a bottle,
the ladies bring a plate!

17:45.667 --> 17:47.584
Oh, they do, they do.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.959
- Hello!
- Oh, what you got there, love?

17:49.042 --> 17:50.042
Look at that!

17:50.126 --> 17:51.376
Nice to see you without

17:51.459 --> 17:53.292
that dingbat camera in front
of your face, Jeffrey.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.167
- G'day, Rick.
- Thank you. Hey, mate.

17:55.251 --> 17:58.501
No cameras tonight.
That means you too, Bob.

17:58.584 --> 18:00.209
I don't know what
you ladies are cooking up,

18:00.292 --> 18:01.667
but the suspense is killing me.

18:01.751 --> 18:03.042
What time is it
there, Rick?

18:03.126 --> 18:05.167
One o'clock, Bob.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.042
Care to partake,
Mrs Marsh?

18:07.126 --> 18:08.751
Does liquid
get into this chalk?

18:08.834 --> 18:10.459
You know
you're soaking in it!

18:10.542 --> 18:12.792
Alright. Feed the kids.

18:12.876 --> 18:15.584
Time to crank up some tunes.
What have we got over here?

18:17.251 --> 18:19.417
Oh! Straight off the boat!

18:19.876 --> 18:21.126
Swingin' Safari!

18:21.209 --> 18:22.834
Put it on! Crank it!

18:22.917 --> 18:25.042
Melissa!

18:25.126 --> 18:27.542
You're missing out...again.

18:41.626 --> 18:44.584
- Like a moon landing.
- Yeah.

18:44.667 --> 18:47.667
- Happy belated, Keith.
- Oh, what the hell's that?

18:47.751 --> 18:51.417
This is a native dart gun, all
the way from Papua New Guinea.

18:51.501 --> 18:54.959
- Right.
- Exotic Papua New Guinea.

18:55.042 --> 18:56.667
Wow.

18:56.751 --> 18:58.417
- Hey, Sandy...
- Oh!

18:58.501 --> 19:00.751
- Oi! Keith!
- Only joking! Only joking.

19:00.834 --> 19:03.751
I tell you, one day,
that dog's gonna explode!

19:08.417 --> 19:09.876
<i>Top shot'.!</i>

19:10.584 --> 19:12.209
There'll be more than
balloons popping tonight,

19:12.292 --> 19:13.917
Keith Hall.

19:27.126 --> 19:29.584
New moves!
Come on! Let's dance!

19:31.834 --> 19:34.334
You kids keep it down
in there, alright?

19:34.417 --> 19:36.417
You take a big chunk,
a chunk of blubber.

19:36.501 --> 19:39.376
Don't.

19:41.251 --> 19:44.459
I told you to keep it down,
or I'd knock your blocks off!

19:44.542 --> 19:45.959
Boofheads!

19:47.459 --> 19:48.667
Cripes almighty!

19:48.751 --> 19:51.584
Go talk to your daughter!
She's doing my head in.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.001
What's going on
with that umbrella?

19:55.084 --> 19:57.584
Darling, can you eat
one of these in front of me

19:57.667 --> 19:59.501
so I know you're not gonna
starve to death?

20:01.001 --> 20:02.876
I'm not hungry.

20:02.959 --> 20:06.459
I SO don't have time
for this.

20:07.334 --> 20:08.667
Alright.

20:08.751 --> 20:13.584
Nobody leaves this table
till Melissa eats two rissoles.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.667
And you eat them, darling,

20:17.751 --> 20:20.334
or I'll shove 'em
down your throat.

20:20.417 --> 20:23.084
Just friggin' eat it!
Come on!

20:23.167 --> 20:24.792
Eat the rissoles!

20:26.626 --> 20:28.959
- Hurry up!
- Eat, eat, eat!

20:34.084 --> 20:35.709
- Just eat it.
- Eat it!

20:35.792 --> 20:38.001
Eat 'em, you 'tard,
so we can all get out of here!

20:38.084 --> 20:40.459
And then he says, "Now
we can all get some sleep!"

20:40.542 --> 20:42.459
Ooh, Jesus!

20:42.542 --> 20:44.959
Here we go with
the umbrella business.

20:45.042 --> 20:46.834
Rick, I've told you
a thousand times,

20:46.917 --> 20:48.584
these things are
bloody lethal, mate!

20:48.667 --> 20:50.292
Yes, Bob.
We've heard it all before.

20:50.376 --> 20:52.001
Umbrellas should be
screwed down!

20:52.084 --> 20:53.584
You'll thank me for this
one day!

20:53.667 --> 20:55.042
Nervous?

20:56.251 --> 20:57.792
Short-changed.

20:59.084 --> 21:00.792
Whatever happened
to pink ponies

21:00.876 --> 21:02.917
and Leif Garrett posters?

21:03.001 --> 21:07.501
Honestly, sometimes I wish
we'd just stopped at the boys.

21:10.209 --> 21:12.834
- Ooh. Oh...
- Anyway...

21:12.917 --> 21:16.459
Check out Liam -
shit-scared of a dolphin!

21:17.959 --> 21:19.251
Yeah, rack off, Andrew!

21:19.334 --> 21:21.001
What about the bird sanctuary?

21:21.084 --> 21:22.876
Aggro! Pissing his pants!

21:22.959 --> 21:24.959
Yeah? Wanna keep
those teeth, homo?

21:25.042 --> 21:26.667
I was scared.

21:26.751 --> 21:28.126
Keira still cries herself
to sleep.

21:29.126 --> 21:31.542
Who feeds kids
to sugar-crazed lorikeets?

21:33.334 --> 21:35.834
One day we should sue
our parents for child abuse.

21:37.376 --> 21:38.417
Psst.

21:39.751 --> 21:41.001
What's the matter?

21:41.084 --> 21:42.792
The whale.

21:57.001 --> 22:00.584
Jeff, Jeff,
we've got a stunt to shoot!

22:00.667 --> 22:02.626
Melly, darling,
did you eat your din-dins?

22:03.834 --> 22:06.501
Oh, good girl. Right, then.

22:06.584 --> 22:09.251
Everybody off the leash.
Rumpus room now. Come on.

22:09.334 --> 22:12.167
No more shenanigans!
You hear me, you rug rats?

22:22.417 --> 22:25.126
OK, OK.
Death Cheaters, saddle up.

22:25.209 --> 22:27.542
Tonight we're gonna pull off
our biggest stunt ever.

22:32.042 --> 22:35.626
Death from above!

22:35.709 --> 22:37.459
Give me a turn!

22:37.542 --> 22:40.334
- “A - “Ay turn!
y turn! My turn!

22:40.417 --> 22:42.042
Then what? You dip it in?

22:42.126 --> 22:44.084
Righto!
I knew a girl like that once.

22:44.167 --> 22:45.792
It's pretty fancy.

22:45.876 --> 22:48.584
Well, on that note,
should I spin the lazy Susan?

22:48.667 --> 22:50.876
- Why's she lazy anyway?
- Oh, it's Chinese.

22:50.959 --> 22:52.084
What do you mean,
it's Chinese?

22:52.167 --> 22:53.584
It would have been
lazy Sichuan.

22:54.667 --> 22:56.959
- Dip it in, and that's...
- Cheese?

22:57.042 --> 22:59.667
Full of holes.
Just like my wife.

22:59.751 --> 23:01.667
My grandmother
swore by Coon cheese.

23:01.751 --> 23:04.042
She lived to 72. Said it was
her fountain of youth.

23:11.667 --> 23:13.626
We're just...going for a walk.

23:13.709 --> 23:15.542
And don't you dare tell Mum.

23:15.626 --> 23:17.917
Us too. Got a stunt to shoot.

23:18.792 --> 23:19.792
Coming?

23:19.876 --> 23:21.917
Everyone's annoying me
and it's not fair!

23:22.001 --> 23:23.626
Alright, now, Liz... Liz! Liz!

23:23.709 --> 23:25.667
Give us the signal
if they come looking, OK?

23:25.751 --> 23:29.126
Not listening! Not listening!
I want to go home!

23:29.209 --> 23:30.834
Can I come?

23:30.917 --> 23:32.917
No, um...
you get to watch a movie.

23:33.001 --> 23:34.459
Deep Throat.
It's about a dentist.

23:34.751 --> 23:36.751
Look! Look, look, look!

23:36.834 --> 23:39.001
I actually need Melly
for this one. Melly?

23:39.084 --> 23:41.292
A girl? Shit a brick!

23:41.376 --> 23:43.042
UP yours, Jeff! No way!

23:43.126 --> 23:44.751
Hey, I'm the director, OK?

23:44.834 --> 23:46.251
You wanna be in this movie
or what?

23:46.792 --> 23:48.667
Melly, welcome to
the Death Cheaters.

23:56.834 --> 23:58.626
OK, Death Cheaters,
hose him down.

23:58.709 --> 24:00.334
Soak him good,
because it'll protect him.

24:00.417 --> 24:01.834
Scotty, water!

24:04.167 --> 24:06.334
OK, boss.
Water's coming on.

24:07.084 --> 24:08.084
Ohh!

24:08.167 --> 24:10.167
So, you're a normal bloke
tossing the chops,

24:10.251 --> 24:12.334
then it all goes pear-shaped
when the barbecue explodes.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.126
Damian, fuel!

24:20.251 --> 24:22.209
Milady.

24:22.292 --> 24:24.084
- What's that?
- Wardrobe.

24:24.167 --> 24:25.251
Mum's old wedding dress.

24:25.334 --> 24:27.459
She never wears it.
Head protection!

24:27.542 --> 24:29.792
One of Aunty Jo's.
100% fireproof.

24:29.876 --> 24:31.792
What am I, a poofter?

24:31.876 --> 24:33.584
Yeah, thanks for that, Gerome.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.876
We've only got an half an hour
tops. Everybody in position.

24:35.959 --> 24:37.584
Andrew, ignition.

24:37.667 --> 24:40.084
I yell "turps", OK,
you throw the grenade.

24:40.167 --> 24:42.001
Scotty, he yells "water",
we're shutting down -

24:42.084 --> 24:43.709
Hunter runs the hose,
Melly puts him out.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.751
Travis, you are on lookout.
Got it?

24:45.834 --> 24:47.459
Ready when you are, CB!

24:47.542 --> 24:50.501
Jeff, please. I want to go back
and watch Mr Squiggle.

24:50.584 --> 24:52.501
No, no, no, no, no.
But you're a Death Cheater now.

24:52.584 --> 24:55.459
And it's perfectly safe. You're
not gonna get burnt, Gerome is.

24:57.251 --> 24:58.876
- Can you put a Flake in there?
- Yeah.

24:58.959 --> 25:02.542
Well, tonight is about
new rules!

25:02.626 --> 25:05.292
Anybody who drops their bread
in the fondue

25:05.376 --> 25:07.417
has to kiss the person
next to them.

25:07.501 --> 25:10.709
Yeah.

25:10.792 --> 25:12.126
Why not?

25:18.417 --> 25:20.126
What's that?

25:21.792 --> 25:24.459
Here, try it. It's the stuff
Mum puts in her cola.

25:24.542 --> 25:27.167
No! We gotta roll!
Bring on the safety water!

25:27.251 --> 25:31.459
- More safety water!
- It's cold! Arggh!

25:31.542 --> 25:33.417
Oh!

25:33.501 --> 25:36.501
No, no. I got it, I got it,
I got it! I got it. No, no.

25:36.584 --> 25:38.251
You can't pick it up.

25:38.334 --> 25:39.959
You can't cheat, mate.

25:40.042 --> 25:41.834
Everybody in position.

25:42.459 --> 25:43.667
Camera rolling.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.376
Here we go again!

25:45.459 --> 25:47.084
Whoops!

25:47.167 --> 25:49.876
Death Cheaters On Fire!
And action!

25:49.959 --> 25:51.626
Oh, my God! The chops!

25:55.501 --> 25:57.209
Arggh!

25:57.292 --> 26:00.417
- Anything you want, mate.
- Oops! Dropped mine.

26:00.501 --> 26:02.459
Pucker up, Keith.

26:02.542 --> 26:05.001
Whew! Crikey!

26:14.251 --> 26:16.001
Catch.

26:27.167 --> 26:29.084
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

26:36.084 --> 26:38.084
Ohhh!

26:39.209 --> 26:40.834
Jeff, there's no water!

26:40.917 --> 26:42.542
Oh, bugger it!

26:42.626 --> 26:43.792
Whoa!

26:44.584 --> 26:46.334
Travis, you're stepping
on the hose!

26:46.417 --> 26:48.167
Whoo-hoo!

26:48.251 --> 26:49.876
You're in trouble
now, mate!

26:58.167 --> 27:00.167
Pool! Pool! Jump in the pool!

27:09.667 --> 27:12.501
Here's to Bob's
umbrella phobia. Cheers.

27:12.584 --> 27:14.709
Yes! Yes!

27:14.792 --> 27:17.334
- Yes! Great!
- And cut!

27:17.417 --> 27:19.084
That was fucking untold!

27:19.167 --> 27:22.542
Are you trying to kill me?!
I'm not doing this anymore!

27:22.626 --> 27:24.959
I quit! Give me the vodka!

27:25.042 --> 27:27.584
This pool
stinks of petrol!

27:27.667 --> 27:29.709
- I'm on it, alright?
- Bags first!

27:31.751 --> 27:32.917
Arggh!

27:39.126 --> 27:41.667
Dickhead!

27:41.751 --> 27:44.542
Alright. Number 96 is about to
start. Everybody off to bed.

27:45.834 --> 27:48.542
- Go on. Get going.
- Sleep tight, boys.

27:48.626 --> 27:51.417
Jesus, Gerome,
what are you playing at?

27:51.501 --> 27:54.376
- Batman.
- What?

27:54.459 --> 27:57.167
Alright. Come on.
Achtung. Get moving.

27:57.251 --> 28:00.376
Uncle Rick, can I, um,
stay here with Melly?

28:02.042 --> 28:04.376
Don't see a problem with that,
stud.

28:09.334 --> 28:10.959
Go on.

28:11.042 --> 28:14.626
Night-night! Sleep tight!
Don't let the bedbugs bite!

28:17.001 --> 28:18.459
Thank God.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.501
You wanna
turn the telly over?

28:24.584 --> 28:26.251
Like...upside down?

28:30.501 --> 28:33.167
Ohh, Rick,
go for it, mate!

28:36.167 --> 28:38.542
It's all getting a bit...
moist under the collar.

28:40.126 --> 28:42.376
Last chance to turn back.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.459
No.

28:44.542 --> 28:46.292
No.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.834
Where's that fondue?

28:50.834 --> 28:52.126
You alive?

28:55.126 --> 28:56.251
No.

28:57.501 --> 28:59.126
I'm really sorry.

28:59.209 --> 29:01.167
It's gonna be an awesome
sequence in the film.

29:02.251 --> 29:03.959
What's the film about?

29:05.501 --> 29:07.667
Haven't figured
that bit out yet.

29:07.751 --> 29:09.209
Is the whale gonna be in it?

29:10.292 --> 29:11.917
I guess so.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.751
The TV said
that she did it on purpose.

29:18.584 --> 29:21.042
That she swam up the beach
deliberately.

29:24.001 --> 29:25.709
Why would she have done that?

29:27.376 --> 29:29.292
Do you think she got lost?

29:30.376 --> 29:31.667
I don't know.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.251
Will you sleep with me?

29:43.251 --> 29:44.876
I'm scared.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.667
Of what?

29:49.542 --> 29:51.084
Everything.

30:19.084 --> 30:20.459
Like Nanna does.

30:24.501 --> 30:26.251
Put your arm around me.

30:43.334 --> 30:45.584
Whoo-hoo!

30:47.584 --> 30:49.501
Andrew, you dimwit! Go home!

30:50.501 --> 30:52.292
Yes!

30:57.751 --> 31:00.126
Yeah, she...she thought
it was the other one!

31:02.209 --> 31:06.376
The next game is called
Swinging Safari.

31:06.459 --> 31:07.834
Oh, yeah?

31:08.209 --> 31:09.834
This is a vase.

31:09.917 --> 31:13.876
Gentlemen, you all have keys.

31:15.584 --> 31:16.959
Ooh!

31:17.626 --> 31:20.751
Oh, no way!

31:20.834 --> 31:22.584
- You're joking.
- Yes.

31:22.667 --> 31:24.292
You've heard about it,

31:24.376 --> 31:26.459
you've read about it,

31:26.542 --> 31:29.542
and tonight,
you're going to live it.

31:30.209 --> 31:36.251
Because the world is spinning
like a rotisserie chook.

31:36.334 --> 31:39.001
Who wants to get left behind?

31:43.209 --> 31:44.417
Stuff it. I'm in.

31:50.251 --> 31:51.251
I'm in.

31:53.542 --> 31:54.626
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

32:03.959 --> 32:05.501
Now.

32:05.584 --> 32:07.792
Gale, darling,
would you like to go first?

32:29.084 --> 32:30.542
My hand's stuck.

32:32.292 --> 32:34.501
- My hand's stuck.
- Oh, no!

32:34.584 --> 32:35.792
Come here, come here.

32:35.876 --> 32:37.667
No, no, no. It's stuck.
It's stuck. It's stuck.

32:37.751 --> 32:39.667
- It's stuck!
- Push it back in.

32:39.751 --> 32:43.376
I'll just...l'll just...
I'll get the KY jelly.

32:43.459 --> 32:45.667
- Gale, darling...
- It's alright. I'm fine.

32:45.751 --> 32:48.001
- Pull it harder, mate!
- I'm pulling!

32:48.084 --> 32:50.209
She's gotta let go of the keys!

32:50.292 --> 32:52.459
- Don't lose the mood!
- Ouch!

32:58.084 --> 32:59.417
What's that?

33:06.709 --> 33:07.709
Ooh!

34:13.292 --> 34:14.501
This is wrong.

34:15.917 --> 34:17.333
All of it!

34:19.376 --> 34:20.876
Look at us!

34:22.251 --> 34:24.167
We should all be ashamed
of ourselves.

34:24.251 --> 34:26.792
- Oh, God!
- Come on, Sandy.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.542
Oh, Keith...

34:32.626 --> 34:34.251
- Give us a jiffy.
- Keith, stop it.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.667
Two ticks. Nearly there.

34:35.833 --> 34:37.292
I'll give you more than two ticks

34:37.376 --> 34:38.501
if you don't stop
plonking my wife!

34:38.583 --> 34:41.083
Stop it. Stop it.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.583
Get off her, or you'll be
dead sorry in the morning!

35:08.251 --> 35:09.876
Come on, get in the car!

35:09.959 --> 35:11.626
Why can't we catch the bus
like everybody else?

35:11.709 --> 35:13.584
Because you're not like
everybody else!

35:13.667 --> 35:15.667
- Shut it!
- Oh, now we're trapped.

35:15.751 --> 35:18.209
Why are you being
such a dick, Dad?

35:20.251 --> 35:22.501
- Just shut up!
- Yeah? You gonna make me?

35:22.584 --> 35:24.584
Oop!

35:24.667 --> 35:26.292
Ooh!

35:29.667 --> 35:31.626
Oi! Hey!

35:33.542 --> 35:36.001
- You alright, mate?
- Yep. Yeah, I'm good.

35:36.084 --> 35:38.584
- Oh, Dad ran over Jeff.
- Bloody idiot.

35:42.167 --> 35:44.376
Jeez. What's up their bums?

35:46.626 --> 35:48.376
You're not going
to state schools anymore.

35:48.459 --> 35:50.084
I'm not going
to a poofter school!

35:50.167 --> 35:52.501
You're going to
the King's School...

35:52.584 --> 35:54.001
Can you believe that?

35:57.751 --> 35:59.584
Oh! Crying out loud!

36:10.584 --> 36:11.751
Save the whales!

36:11.834 --> 36:13.959
- Oh, bit late now, isn't it?
- Go suck plankton, you lezzo!

36:14.042 --> 36:15.667
- Hey!
<i>'</i> OW!

36:15.751 --> 36:17.709
Watch it, you little bastards!
Get out of here!

36:17.792 --> 36:19.584
Smells like Bec Marsh.

36:19.667 --> 36:22.376
Oh, as much as we love
our wayward friend here,

36:22.459 --> 36:24.376
I think it's about time
he found his flippers

36:24.459 --> 36:27.167
and made his way
back to the sea...

36:27.251 --> 36:29.667
..where he belongs.

36:29.751 --> 36:33.584
I understand there's
a big tide coming in.

36:37.001 --> 36:38.667
What's happening?

36:38.751 --> 36:40.376
Rigor mortis.

36:40.459 --> 36:42.584
No, to our parents.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.667
Why were they doing that
to each other?

36:45.959 --> 36:47.667
I don't know.

36:48.709 --> 36:50.376
But you can't tell anybody.

36:50.459 --> 36:53.876
Make me a promise.
Nobody ever knows.

36:59.334 --> 37:01.501
We just go to school
like normal.

37:02.292 --> 37:04.792
Nothing ever happened.
It's just business as usual.

37:20.584 --> 37:22.459
Me, me, me!

37:25.626 --> 37:28.626
But, Mrs Wilson,
we can't even afford shoes!

37:28.709 --> 37:31.417
Mum makes walk to the beach
in tissue boxes!

37:31.501 --> 37:34.209
Alright, then. A Iamington...

37:34.292 --> 37:36.417
...and a Mint Pattie,

37:36.501 --> 37:38.667
in case you have to walk to
Africa to help the poor people.

37:38.751 --> 37:40.584
Thanks, Mrs Wilson...

37:40.667 --> 37:43.167
- ...sucker!
- Hey! I heard that!

37:49.459 --> 37:51.126
We should all
be honoured

37:51.209 --> 37:53.709
by the arrival of
the great blue whale,

37:53.792 --> 37:56.959
nature's largest living
creation,

37:57.042 --> 38:00.626
right here on Nobby's Beach.

38:00.709 --> 38:01.792
Why?

38:03.584 --> 38:05.251
Why would she kill herself?

38:05.334 --> 38:06.501
That's
a good question, Melissa.

38:07.126 --> 38:09.626
Whales have been beaching
themselves for centuries.

38:09.709 --> 38:12.167
Has anybody got a clue
as to why?

38:12.251 --> 38:13.917
The Lebanese?

38:14.751 --> 38:17.334
The truth is,
nobody knows.

38:18.167 --> 38:20.417
Oil tankers. Pollution.

38:20.501 --> 38:22.376
Maybe she got lost.

38:23.042 --> 38:25.917
Or maybe...she'd just
had enough.

38:36.917 --> 38:38.876
- I'm gonna play the murderer.
- Then I want to be the victim.

38:38.959 --> 38:40.626
- You already are.
- OK, no.

38:40.709 --> 38:43.251
Casting doesn't start till
I speak to Mr Logan, alright?

38:43.334 --> 38:45.959
No. Come on. You said...

38:46.042 --> 38:47.126
Oh, shit!

38:55.417 --> 38:57.167
That looks nice.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.042
Here. Have some of mine.

38:59.126 --> 39:01.042
Got leftover fondue. Yummy.

39:01.792 --> 39:03.709
No, thanks. I...

39:04.251 --> 39:06.042
...don't want to eat anymore.

39:08.251 --> 39:09.959
I don't see the point.

39:14.459 --> 39:17.084
- Can I have that?
- But it's got sand on it.

39:17.167 --> 39:18.876
They're called 'sand-wishes'.

39:21.209 --> 39:22.959
Mr Logan!

39:23.042 --> 39:25.084
Hello, hello, hello!

39:26.251 --> 39:28.042
Wait here. I'll be right back.

39:30.917 --> 39:32.542
Has everyone done
their homework?

39:32.626 --> 39:34.251
- Yes!
- Mr Logan. Mr Logan.

39:34.334 --> 39:35.376
I'm starting a new film

39:35.459 --> 39:37.917
and I really need you
to be the main character.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.584
What fresh hell
on yonder window breaks?

39:46.209 --> 39:49.251
Not good enough, Mr Hall!
I'm giving you a C!

39:49.334 --> 39:51.001
That's OK, Mr Logan.

39:51.084 --> 39:53.834
'Cause I'm giving you a D -
D for dead!

39:53.917 --> 39:57.167
Yes!

40:04.751 --> 40:07.001
Stop hurting her!

40:07.084 --> 40:09.292
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

40:20.792 --> 40:23.626
- Hey. Gerome!
- What?

40:24.251 --> 40:27.001
I was thinking - we cut out the
shark and we work the whale in.

40:27.084 --> 40:29.042
You know, make a new plot.
What do you think?

40:30.292 --> 40:32.667
Jeff. . mack off.

40:36.834 --> 40:38.501
G'day, Peter Frampton.

40:38.584 --> 40:40.167
Hey.

40:46.376 --> 40:49.459
My best friend has just
dumped me for my sister.

40:49.542 --> 40:52.334
This is all going...tits up!

40:53.042 --> 40:55.876
I was almost
Miss Wallaroo!

40:55.959 --> 40:57.584
My memory is

40:57.667 --> 40:59.751
you were almost expelled
from June Dally-Watkins.

40:59.834 --> 41:01.459
This is all your fault.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.709
Everything was going fine.
Until you ruined it!

41:04.792 --> 41:07.792
I ruined it? You know what
ruined it? Middle-aged tits!

41:07.876 --> 41:10.001
I've seen better crepes
at Pancakes on the Rocks!

41:10.084 --> 41:12.084
Hey! Get!

41:12.167 --> 41:14.292
Encyclopedias are chock-a-block
full of things you'll discover.

41:14.376 --> 41:16.001
I mean, there's no end to it.

41:16.084 --> 41:17.709
If you look up A,
you'll find out

41:17.792 --> 41:21.626
all sorts of fascinating facts
about alcoholics...

41:21.709 --> 41:24.251
And tell the kids
to look up T for 'tragic'

41:24.334 --> 41:25.959
or...D for 'dildo'.

41:26.042 --> 41:28.584
I mean, who knows,
one day you might find yourself

41:28.667 --> 41:31.167
waking up next to a tragic
dildo-loving alcoholic,

41:31.251 --> 41:33.417
and THEN where
will you be, huh?

41:33.501 --> 41:36.209
Probably sleeping downstairs
in the garage!

41:36.584 --> 41:38.167
You fat cow!

41:38.251 --> 41:40.376
Oh, you're just jealous!

41:40.459 --> 41:43.376
- Of Keith Hall? Ha!
- Take a Valium.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.751
Now I'll get a discount
Fuck and Wigwam!

41:45.834 --> 41:52.126
Ha! Don't make me
la-a-a-a-a-a-a-augh!

41:52.876 --> 41:54.917
Melly, go play
in the traffic.

42:29.542 --> 42:32.001
You know, I don't blame Bob.
I feel sorry for him.

42:33.792 --> 42:35.417
He probably thought
he was at the morgue

42:35.501 --> 42:37.251
looking at you lying there
like a stunned mullet.

42:37.334 --> 42:40.042
My nickname at school?
'Tripod'!

42:40.126 --> 42:41.751
- Yes! I'm a wanker!
- Oh!

42:41.834 --> 42:44.167
I've got the dirty magazines
to prove it!

42:53.251 --> 42:55.792
You loved it!

42:55.876 --> 42:57.501
Love is overrated.

42:57.584 --> 42:59.209
I had to pry him off you
with a tyre iron!

42:59.292 --> 43:01.001
- Oh, Richard!
- What are youse two on about?

43:01.084 --> 43:02.959
- Shut up!
- Quit your whining, will you?

43:03.042 --> 43:04.876
Shut up in the back, or you'll
get a knuckle sandwich!

43:04.959 --> 43:06.584
Ooh, he's gonna give us
a knuckle sandwich!

43:06.667 --> 43:08.292
I'll slap you kids!

43:08.376 --> 43:10.959
- Dad, look out! Ow!
- Dad, you hit Melissa!

43:11.042 --> 43:13.126
Rack off!

43:13.209 --> 43:14.834
..getting over Pretty Lady.

43:14.917 --> 43:16.584
Pretty Lady falling behind.

43:16.667 --> 43:18.292
Yes, Pretty Lady
is falling behind...

43:23.917 --> 43:26.501
Hurry, before that
mongrel Iabrador steals it!

43:30.834 --> 43:35.626
Jo Jones is so washed up,
the tide wouldn't take her out!

43:36.251 --> 43:38.084
I'm gonna mow the lawn.
Jeffrey!

43:38.167 --> 43:40.167
You spend more time
mowing that lawn

43:40.251 --> 43:42.376
than you've ever spent
mowing mine!

43:43.917 --> 43:45.917
Do not let that animal
in this room!

43:46.001 --> 43:48.959
And take off your shoes!
Christ!

43:49.042 --> 43:51.459
I've got a splitting headache!

43:56.126 --> 43:57.292
Mum, that wasn't your aspirin.

43:58.626 --> 43:59.959
Those were your pearl earrings.

44:02.876 --> 44:04.501
- Oh, Mum!
- Jeff! Jeff!

44:06.334 --> 44:07.959
- D-Dad...
- What?

44:08.042 --> 44:09.667
She swallowed
her pearl earrings!

44:09.751 --> 44:12.709
She swallowed her earrings?!
Bee? Rebecca!

44:13.292 --> 44:15.042
Your mother just swallowed
herpeafl...

44:15.959 --> 44:16.959
Dad!

44:18.626 --> 44:20.792
Oh, g'day, Mr Marsh.
How are they hanging?

44:23.501 --> 44:26.167
What do you want us to do?

44:26.251 --> 44:29.001
Get off the...the carpet!

44:29.084 --> 44:30.917
Um...shouldn't we take her
to the hospital?

44:31.001 --> 44:33.709
Take her to the bathroom
and get her a box of laxatives!

44:33.792 --> 44:36.792
And, Rooster, you get the hell
out of my house!

44:38.667 --> 44:41.334
It's alright, Mrs M.
I mean, you can poo 'em out.

44:41.417 --> 44:43.542
Laxative...

44:43.626 --> 44:45.917
Do you sometimes wonder
if Jesus has passed you by?

44:55.001 --> 44:56.376
Here.

44:56.834 --> 44:59.626
I brought you something.
It's a space food stick.

44:59.709 --> 45:02.584
You know, made by NASA
for the astronauts.

45:05.667 --> 45:07.292
Please?

45:07.376 --> 45:09.876
Just one bite? For me?

45:18.292 --> 45:20.084
Keira! Ugh!

45:20.167 --> 45:21.792
What now?!

45:21.876 --> 45:23.876
I promise they're not
bluebottle stings!

45:23.959 --> 45:25.584
Right, toilets!

45:25.667 --> 45:28.292
- No! No!
- Urine counteracts!

45:28.376 --> 45:30.084
She's gonna get
pissed on again.

45:30.167 --> 45:32.751
Please don't pee on me!

45:34.542 --> 45:36.584
Bugger off! Filthy Iezzers!

45:36.667 --> 45:38.542
Toilets!

45:41.417 --> 45:43.709
We're like
the Robinson family.

45:43.792 --> 45:45.751
We're lost in space.

45:46.834 --> 45:50.334
Our flubbery friend seems
to have taken quite a liking

45:50.417 --> 45:52.042
to our beautiful beach.

45:52.709 --> 45:54.417
Give him points.

45:54.501 --> 45:56.501
He's not going out
without a fight.

46:06.501 --> 46:08.126
- I'm gonna go inside with her.
- Yeah, I thought so.

46:08.209 --> 46:10.417
Stop fighting!
Everybody gets a go!

46:10.501 --> 46:13.209
We're going to my room. Don't
you dare tell the grown-ups!

46:13.292 --> 46:16.292
What bloody grown-ups?!
They're aren't any!

46:16.376 --> 46:18.542
Now we can kill each other!

46:18.626 --> 46:20.709
- Slut!
- Takes one to know one!

46:31.042 --> 46:33.417
- Gerome.
- What?

46:33.501 --> 46:35.167
Four thunders,
seven ball-shooters,

46:35.251 --> 46:37.084
four Roman candles, sulfur

46:37.167 --> 46:39.626
and five cups of pool chlorine.

46:39.709 --> 46:41.751
Chuck them in the fire
all at once.

46:41.834 --> 46:44.209
Jeff. Please.

46:44.292 --> 46:46.751
Someone's gonna get burnt.

46:46.834 --> 46:50.209
- Well...we'd better not.
- Wuss!

46:52.834 --> 46:55.834
I see fireworks.
I see fireworks!

46:55.917 --> 46:57.959
Scissors, paper, rock.

47:00.417 --> 47:02.126
Next.

47:05.792 --> 47:09.042
Don't! You're supposed to be
letting them off one at a time!

47:09.126 --> 47:10.751
Batter up!

47:10.834 --> 47:12.584
- Bombs away!
- You're scaring the kids!

47:12.667 --> 47:14.376
Don't!

47:14.459 --> 47:17.584
Stop! Please stop!

47:18.667 --> 47:20.167
Arggh!

47:30.584 --> 47:32.626
Before
we say goodbye to Sandy,

47:32.709 --> 47:35.167
let's talk about pets.

47:35.251 --> 47:36.917
So, how's your
practising been going?

47:38.876 --> 47:42.292
Kaye Hall believed pets opened
the door to responsibility -

47:42.376 --> 47:44.584
something kids
could watch grow...

47:44.667 --> 47:47.417
...and eventually
say farewell to.

47:47.501 --> 47:50.042
For Kaye, burying a beloved pet
was a way

47:50.126 --> 47:53.667
to prepare a young mind for
life's inevitable tragedies.

47:53.751 --> 47:55.376
The problem was
Doody wouldn't die.

47:55.459 --> 47:57.667
Doody, din-din.

47:57.751 --> 47:59.959
20 years old
and still going strong.

48:00.042 --> 48:02.792
Kaye's kids had not experienced
the death of a pet,

48:02.876 --> 48:04.542
no matter how hard she tried.

48:09.042 --> 48:11.751
You had to hand it to
Rick Jones for one-upmanship.

48:11.834 --> 48:13.584
Nobody could top the turtle.

48:13.667 --> 48:15.292
All the way
from the Galépagos.

48:15.376 --> 48:17.876
Exotic Galépagos.

48:17.959 --> 48:21.167
- I'm gonna name him HELP!
- I'm gonna name him FIRE!

48:21.251 --> 48:22.876
I'm gonna call you Tommy.

48:22.959 --> 48:25.334
Tommy just wanted to go home,

48:25.417 --> 48:27.167
and nothing was gonna stop him.

48:27.251 --> 48:28.959
Quick, Tommy. Run home.

48:29.042 --> 48:31.251
Swim back to Galépagos
as fast as you can.

48:31.417 --> 48:34.209
- Fat chance.
- Not going anywhere, loser.

48:34.292 --> 48:36.626
Please don't hurt him.

48:36.709 --> 48:38.584
Stop! Stop! Please stop!
Please!

48:38.667 --> 48:40.459
If it makes you feel
any better,

48:40.542 --> 48:42.167
the boys became dentists.

48:42.251 --> 48:45.751
Cal is still in jail
and Liam is now called Lenore.

48:45.834 --> 48:47.459
Suffer, little turtle!

48:47.542 --> 48:49.167
Turtles can live to 100...

48:50.959 --> 48:53.792
...and poor Tommy was only
eight years old.

48:58.167 --> 48:59.459
The Hall twins didn't go out

48:59.542 --> 49:01.876
and buy pets
like the rest of us.

49:01.959 --> 49:03.626
Pets magically found them.

49:06.126 --> 49:08.667
- Meet Trouser Snake!
- Has that boy got a big snake?

49:08.751 --> 49:11.584
- Ask me when he's 17.
- Shut up!

49:19.876 --> 49:22.084
- Oh! Can I have one of those?
- But you don't drink, love.

49:22.167 --> 49:23.792
It's about time I started!

49:25.584 --> 49:28.042
Those boys!

49:28.126 --> 49:30.667
They just
don't have a stop button!

49:30.751 --> 49:32.834
Those boys are gonna be
the death of me.

49:32.917 --> 49:34.251
And here's the problem.

49:34.334 --> 49:37.334
Like Keith said, his boys
didn't have a stop button.

49:37.417 --> 49:40.709
If it crawled, slithered,
spat, bit or strangled,

49:40.792 --> 49:43.626
it ended up in
the Hall backyard of death.

49:44.917 --> 49:46.876
Which brings us back to Sandy.

49:46.959 --> 49:48.584
Please, please
let it be a pony!

49:48.667 --> 49:50.667
They say labs are
the perfect dogs for kids...

49:50.751 --> 49:54.667
It's a Kleenex labrador puppy.

49:54.751 --> 49:56.667
Oh!

49:56.751 --> 49:59.501
Great. New carpet!

49:59.584 --> 50:01.834
Now we'll have to get plastic.

50:01.917 --> 50:03.876
Aw! So gentle!

50:04.542 --> 50:07.459
Oh, baby Sandy
was gentle, alright.

50:07.542 --> 50:10.667
Gently eating her way through
every barbecue in Australia.

50:10.751 --> 50:13.292
Bloody umbrellas! Sandy!

50:15.459 --> 50:18.626
Ooh! Get off! Off!
Get off the table! Disgusting!

50:19.459 --> 50:22.709
The problem was Sandy had
no stop button either,

50:22.792 --> 50:25.084
and whenever she was left
alone, she'd help herself

50:25.167 --> 50:28.167
to all the other pet food
up for grabs in Wyong Place.

50:28.251 --> 50:30.042
Keith Hall put it perfectly -

50:30.126 --> 50:32.917
one day, that dog
was gonna explode.

50:33.001 --> 50:34.834
<i>~</i>
<i>~</i>

50:45.667 --> 50:47.542
I, um...

50:47.626 --> 50:49.542
...l want to thank Sandy...

50:49.626 --> 50:51.876
...for bringing us
together and...

50:51.959 --> 50:54.542
...putting all our differences
behind us.

50:56.292 --> 50:57.959
We're really sorry,
Uncle Bob.

50:58.042 --> 50:59.251
Yeah.

51:00.751 --> 51:02.001
But sadly,

51:02.917 --> 51:05.209
this is where we say goodbye

51:05.292 --> 51:07.042
to our loyal friend.

51:09.167 --> 51:11.001
Come on, old girl.

51:13.459 --> 51:15.334
- Rick?
- Look out!

51:15.417 --> 51:18.001
Oh, God, jeez! Thanks,
Rick.

51:18.084 --> 51:19.709
Thanks, Keith.

51:19.792 --> 51:21.417
UP! Come on!

51:21.501 --> 51:24.709
And go, go, go, go,
90,90,go,go,go.

51:24.792 --> 51:27.251
Mum.
Your earrings smell like shit.

51:34.209 --> 51:36.209
Oh, sausages
in the grave.

51:36.834 --> 51:38.751
- Good name for an album, huh?
- Shut up, Keith!

51:44.501 --> 51:46.167
Should have been you.

51:46.251 --> 51:47.959
Your mother and I
have had a talk.

51:48.042 --> 51:50.626
We're selling your grandma's
jewellery and her teeth.

51:50.709 --> 51:52.209
You're all going to
Catholic boarding schools.

51:52.542 --> 51:54.292
This is bullcrap!

51:54.376 --> 51:56.917
No. No.
I don't want to hear it.

51:57.001 --> 51:59.209
The priests will have
their way with you!

52:06.626 --> 52:09.542
Pick those toys up.

52:17.167 --> 52:19.084
No! No!

52:19.167 --> 52:20.459
Fine.

52:22.126 --> 52:23.751
Please, Mummy!

52:26.917 --> 52:27.917
Please don't.

52:29.584 --> 52:31.417
No. Please not Humphrey!

52:31.501 --> 52:33.167
No!

52:41.751 --> 52:45.126
This is it. I think she's
finally on her way home.

52:45.209 --> 52:46.834
And one!

52:46.917 --> 52:48.542
Two!

52:48.626 --> 52:50.251
Three!

52:51.667 --> 52:54.876
Jesus bloody Christ!
The beach is empty.

52:54.959 --> 52:58.709
The streets. Colonel Sanders
couldn't get arrested.

52:58.792 --> 53:01.376
If we don't get rid of
blubber-guts here, mate,

53:01.459 --> 53:04.876
I can tell you,
we're all in the deep-fry!

53:07.251 --> 53:10.626
She's stuck here.
Like us.

53:12.959 --> 53:15.334
- We have to get out of here.
- How?

53:15.417 --> 53:17.126
Would you like a ride,
little girl?

53:24.959 --> 53:26.251
Strangers.

53:27.542 --> 53:29.167
They may smile...

53:29.251 --> 53:30.334
Ooh!

53:31.084 --> 53:33.542
...they may look ordinary,

53:33.626 --> 53:35.709
but you cannot trust them.

53:35.792 --> 53:37.584
I'm not going.
I don't trust them.

53:37.667 --> 53:39.834
You and your Shitty Safari.

53:39.917 --> 53:41.709
Can't you see
what's happening here?

53:41.792 --> 53:44.417
Your daughter was up there
with that boy, giving him a...

53:45.667 --> 53:47.292
Blow job, Bob!

53:47.376 --> 53:49.542
Like the ones I used to
give you last century.

53:49.626 --> 53:52.001
Alright, enough.
I've had it up to here.

53:52.084 --> 53:53.959
Just say something
for once in your life.

53:54.042 --> 53:55.667
I'm not going.

53:56.709 --> 53:58.042
Will you get that bloody

53:58.126 --> 53:59.917
formaldehyde-soaked arse
out of bed?

54:00.001 --> 54:01.626
You're bloody well going,

54:01.709 --> 54:04.876
and bloody well gonna have
a good time if it kills me!

54:04.959 --> 54:08.209
And the god of thunder,
he says, "I'm Thor!"

54:08.292 --> 54:09.917
And she says, "YOU'RE thore?!

54:10.001 --> 54:11.917
"L'm tho thore,
I can hardly pith!"

54:13.709 --> 54:15.417
What have you
got here, Rick?

54:15.501 --> 54:17.626
You've got some Roy Orbison.
You've got some Frank Sinatra.

54:17.709 --> 54:19.376
We've got loads of
good stuff, mate.

54:19.459 --> 54:21.751
We've got Donna Summer,
Telly Savalas,

54:21.834 --> 54:23.459
Swingin' Safari...

54:30.042 --> 54:31.709
It's called the Betamax.

54:31.792 --> 54:34.542
The home video revolution.

54:34.626 --> 54:36.376
You can record TV.

54:36.459 --> 54:38.459
- Wow.
- Wow.

54:49.167 --> 54:50.792
I'm going over to Rooster's.

54:50.876 --> 54:53.084
But don't you dare tell Mum.

54:56.084 --> 54:57.167
Liam, I'm going first!

54:57.251 --> 54:58.917
I don't wanna be
sloppy seconds!

54:59.001 --> 55:00.167
You always go first!

55:00.292 --> 55:02.917
Hey, Gerome.
For old times' sake?

55:06.917 --> 55:07.917
Mate, come on.

55:08.001 --> 55:09.834
One last stunt?
Just you and me?

55:23.292 --> 55:26.376
Congrats, team. You've all been
made honorary Death Cheaters.

55:26.459 --> 55:29.042
Yes! Shazam!

55:30.834 --> 55:33.376
So, I went ballistic and said,
"Mr Wong, Mr Wong..."

55:33.459 --> 55:35.584
"I forgot all my traveller's
cheques!"

55:38.251 --> 55:39.917
Yeah, we've seen the ad, Keith.

55:40.001 --> 55:42.376
Yeah, I'm just saying,
it's a good one.

55:42.459 --> 55:44.292
Pass the Coon, please.

55:48.251 --> 55:49.542
Ah, here's one.

55:49.959 --> 55:52.876
Germaine Greer walks into a bar
and the barman says...

55:52.959 --> 55:54.084
I'm gonna what?!

55:54.167 --> 55:55.834
Breathe underwater,
like Aquaboy.

55:55.917 --> 55:57.876
Liz, get the funnel-webs
out of the pool.

55:57.959 --> 56:00.917
I've rewired the vacuum cleaner
so that it blows in reverse.

56:01.001 --> 56:02.417
See?

56:06.459 --> 56:08.084
We drop the rocks
into the pool.

56:08.167 --> 56:09.876
It drags Andrew to the bottom.

56:09.959 --> 56:12.751
As long as he keeps the hose
in his mouth, he can breathe.

56:12.834 --> 56:14.584
- Then what?
- Well, we film it.

56:14.667 --> 56:17.209
- This is bullcrap!
- I'm not doing it!

56:17.292 --> 56:19.334
Untie me! Untie me, alright?!

56:19.417 --> 56:21.167
But this is
a Death Cheater first.

56:21.251 --> 56:22.876
Not without Gerome, it isn't!

56:22.959 --> 56:25.876
- This sucks!
- It mega sucks!

56:25.959 --> 56:27.417
I'm too old for this shit.

56:31.042 --> 56:33.751
When did Jeff Marsh wake up
such a loser?

56:40.709 --> 56:42.459
Did my homework
and made a choice, mate.

56:42.542 --> 56:44.751
That other system,
that VHS nonsense -

56:44.834 --> 56:46.709
never gonna take off.

56:46.792 --> 56:48.417
Flush.

56:48.501 --> 56:51.334
- What was that?
- Flush.

56:51.417 --> 56:54.126
Oh. Menopause so soon?

56:54.209 --> 56:55.917
Excuse me?

56:56.001 --> 56:59.042
I'm just
talking about my niece.

56:59.126 --> 57:00.709
Minnie Pause.

57:00.876 --> 57:02.626
Looks like she might be
coming to stay

57:02.709 --> 57:04.334
a little earlier than expected.

57:06.167 --> 57:07.459
I said "flush".

57:09.084 --> 57:11.209
I could have said "floozy",
but I didn't.

57:11.292 --> 57:12.709
Are you calling my wife
a floozy?

57:13.042 --> 57:15.626
I'm not calling her anything.
I'm just...stating a fact.

57:16.251 --> 57:17.417
You are a...

57:18.792 --> 57:20.126
...a strumpet!

57:20.209 --> 57:22.292
You do not call my wife
a strumpet!

57:22.376 --> 57:23.709
Sorry, I was gonna
say "crumpet",

57:23.834 --> 57:25.001
but it came out "strumpet".

57:25.084 --> 57:27.042
Big words, pussy-balls.

57:27.126 --> 57:28.751
Says the town bike.

57:28.834 --> 57:30.876
At least I don't need pills
to get mine up.

57:30.959 --> 57:33.584
- Now, what are we playing?
- Poker.

57:33.667 --> 57:34.751
Everybody else has.

57:35.501 --> 57:37.376
HOW dare you?!

57:37.459 --> 57:40.084
- You bloody zip it, Rick!
- You bloody zip it, mate!

57:40.167 --> 57:41.792
- Cock!
- Bush pig!

57:41.876 --> 57:43.001
- Shut up, hussy!
- Alcoholic!

57:43.084 --> 57:45.167
- Bottle blonde!
- Cock tease!

57:45.292 --> 57:46.917
- Drug addict!
- Needle dick!

57:47.001 --> 57:48.626
- Skank!
- Trog!

57:48.709 --> 57:49.751
Slut!

57:49.834 --> 57:51.376
Hardly even
touched the sides.

57:51.459 --> 57:52.667
Well, that's not surprising,
is it?

57:52.751 --> 57:55.417
You'd root a bloody barber's
chair if it had enough hair!

57:55.501 --> 57:58.501
How dare you?!

57:58.584 --> 58:01.126
- Kids, out!
- We can trump that. We're out!

58:03.834 --> 58:05.459
Suck on this!

58:07.834 --> 58:10.292
<i>~</i> Oh!
<i>~</i> Oh!

58:14.334 --> 58:15.876
Yep. Couldn't agree more.

58:16.501 --> 58:18.209
Oh. Shit.

58:26.792 --> 58:28.584
Oh, g'day, Mrs Marsh.

58:28.667 --> 58:31.251
I see you got your
pearl earrings back.

58:33.292 --> 58:34.501
Rebecca!

58:35.001 --> 58:36.084
Oh!

58:36.167 --> 58:37.917
Get out of here,
you filthy mongrels!

58:38.001 --> 58:39.834
Hey, Rooster!
I bloody warned you!

58:39.917 --> 58:41.584
Dog! I know where your f...

58:41.667 --> 58:43.376
Your father's getting
a phone call right now!

58:43.459 --> 58:45.126
He'll hear about this!

58:45.209 --> 58:47.459
Gerome! I saw you too, mate!

58:47.542 --> 58:49.334
What the hell do you think
you're doing?!

58:50.376 --> 58:51.751
Crying out loud!

58:58.417 --> 58:59.626
Jeff?

59:01.584 --> 59:02.876
Jeff?

59:32.334 --> 59:34.917
240 volts by the bleedin' pool!

59:40.001 --> 59:43.251
Well may we say
"God save the Queen"...

59:45.042 --> 59:48.459
...because nothing will save
the Governor-General!

01:01:32.667 --> 01:01:35.584
- Keep those legs together!
- Your husband likes curves!

01:01:35.667 --> 01:01:38.792
Needle dick for years, Gale.
And, you...

01:01:38.876 --> 01:01:41.459
You couldn't fit any more balls
in your pants either!

01:01:42.917 --> 01:01:44.542
Keira, what's that
on your chest?

01:01:44.626 --> 01:01:47.709
They're not bluebottle stings!
Really, they're not!

01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:49.667
Oh, yes, they are!

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:53.792
No, no!

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.709
Stop her!

01:01:55.792 --> 01:01:57.542
- Come to Aunty Gale.
- No! Get off me!

01:01:57.626 --> 01:01:59.001
Don't you dare!

01:01:59.084 --> 01:02:01.042
But, Kaye!

01:02:01.126 --> 01:02:02.751
Urine counteracts.

01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:27.209
Be silent. Be quiet.

01:02:27.292 --> 01:02:29.709
Be silent! BE SILENT!
BE SILENT!

01:02:29.792 --> 01:02:31.417
She pissed on my daughter!

01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:33.792
Oh, you piss on her
twice a weekend!

01:02:33.876 --> 01:02:36.834
Bullshit. Bullshit!

01:02:36.917 --> 01:02:38.917
Mr Hall, do you want
to press any charges?

01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:40.626
No.

01:02:40.709 --> 01:02:42.334
But who do I have to fuck
around here

01:02:42.417 --> 01:02:44.042
to get a bloody
restraining order?!

01:02:44.126 --> 01:02:45.751
I've got homework to do.

01:02:45.834 --> 01:02:47.292
I can give you a hand with
your homework if you like.

01:02:47.417 --> 01:02:50.167
Hey, hey, hey! Enough!

01:03:05.584 --> 01:03:07.417
We're moving to Adelaide!

01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:09.417
Huh! Don't be preposterous!

01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:11.959
- Have you got a better idea?
- Yes, I do.

01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:14.084
Kahlua and milk.

01:03:20.209 --> 01:03:21.917
Avon calling.

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:31.126
- A' Bob!
'Qgh! QW!

01:03:31.209 --> 01:03:32.626
Oh, Jesus!

01:03:34.251 --> 01:03:35.876
I'm calling Rick.

01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:38.167
Oh, no, you're not.

01:03:38.834 --> 01:03:39.917
Watch me.

01:03:41.459 --> 01:03:43.126
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

01:03:43.209 --> 01:03:44.876
- No. No. No, no...
- Give me the phone.

01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:46.667
- Bob, give me the phone.
- I'm c...l'm calling him!

01:03:47.876 --> 01:03:50.876
Oh, you fool!

01:03:50.959 --> 01:03:52.792
You fool!

01:03:59.626 --> 01:04:01.251
Swiss finishing school.

01:04:01.334 --> 01:04:03.501
Advanced etiquette,
foreign languages...

01:04:05.084 --> 01:04:07.042
Lord knows she doesn't
speak English.

01:04:07.126 --> 01:04:09.584
- Rick Jones.
- We need a truce.

01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:11.292
No. I do not need a goose.

01:04:11.459 --> 01:04:13.001
- No, a truce.
- What?

01:04:13.084 --> 01:04:14.542
A truce! Not a goose. A truce.

01:04:14.876 --> 01:04:16.126
Who is this?
I can't understand you.

01:04:16.209 --> 01:04:17.209
Rick. . .!

01:04:19.876 --> 01:04:23.501
The phone is full of
your bloody make-up!

01:04:25.084 --> 01:04:26.751
Darling, it's for you.

01:04:26.834 --> 01:04:29.417
Hey, Melly!

01:04:29.501 --> 01:04:32.292
You're looking a bit crook.
I brought you a Polly Waffle.

01:04:34.167 --> 01:04:35.376
Where are you going?

01:04:36.417 --> 01:04:38.584
I'm going to the ends
of the earth.

01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:41.709
I'm running away to a place
where no-one will ever find me.

01:04:43.876 --> 01:04:45.084
Melbourne.

01:04:46.042 --> 01:04:49.459
I'll start eating again
if you come with me.

01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:53.417
I've got enough money
to get us there.

01:04:53.501 --> 01:04:56.001
We can change our names,
we can become new people,

01:04:56.084 --> 01:04:58.126
and we'll never have to see
our parents again.

01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:01.542
Will you come with me?

01:05:03.709 --> 01:05:04.834
Yes.

01:05:05.626 --> 01:05:07.417
You mean it?

01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:08.584
Yeah, I mean it.

01:05:11.709 --> 01:05:13.334
We have just
one last chore to do

01:05:13.417 --> 01:05:15.292
before we get out
of this hellhole.

01:05:23.126 --> 01:05:25.626
How did it come to this?

01:05:25.709 --> 01:05:29.084
Well, mate, it started
with a pile of keys and a vase.

01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:33.042
Maybe if you had just taken one
for the team and boned Kaye...

01:05:33.126 --> 01:05:34.917
- Oh, right!
- ..everything would be OK.

01:05:35.001 --> 01:05:36.292
Alright, already!

01:05:37.209 --> 01:05:39.334
But we've got to fix it.

01:05:39.417 --> 01:05:42.834
Our bloody women
whipped this whole mess up,

01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:45.126
so it's up to us
to sort it out.

01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:49.167
Like men.

01:06:06.584 --> 01:06:09.751
Go home, Tommy. You hear me?
As fast as you can.

01:06:11.751 --> 01:06:13.792
There you go.
You're free.

01:06:21.834 --> 01:06:23.459
Tommy's going to paradise.

01:06:24.584 --> 01:06:25.876
And so are we.

01:06:33.209 --> 01:06:34.959
So, if we make
the first bus to Central,

01:06:35.042 --> 01:06:37.084
we can make the 10 o'clock
train to Canberra.

01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:39.584
- Have you got any dosh?
- 57 bucks Grandpa gave me

01:06:39.667 --> 01:06:41.792
just before he ate
all the potpourri and died.

01:06:41.876 --> 01:06:43.834
But I know where Mum stashes
her tennis kitty.

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:46.251
That's alright. We'll get jobs.

01:06:46.334 --> 01:06:48.917
I'm ready. I packed.
Last Easter.

01:06:50.376 --> 01:06:52.209
You're not gonna let me down,
are you, Jeff?

01:06:53.584 --> 01:06:55.876
No. Never.

01:07:05.876 --> 01:07:08.584
Jeffrey!

01:07:08.667 --> 01:07:11.167
Oh, Christ!
Not another one!

01:07:12.209 --> 01:07:14.001
Get over here, you trollop!

01:07:14.084 --> 01:07:15.751
Bedroom! Now!

01:07:15.834 --> 01:07:19.459
- Bedroom? What...?
- Separately. Come here!

01:07:19.542 --> 01:07:22.376
Enough! You crossed
the line this time.

01:07:22.459 --> 01:07:25.001
Let's kill him.

01:07:30.167 --> 01:07:31.209
He kissed a girl!

01:07:32.209 --> 01:07:33.292
Thank God!

01:07:33.376 --> 01:07:36.417
There I was thinking
he was a bit...gay.

01:07:36.501 --> 01:07:38.834
She's 14 years old!

01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:41.834
Does she even know which end
to put a tampon in?

01:07:42.501 --> 01:07:43.792
Well, she kissed a boy.

01:07:43.876 --> 01:07:46.042
There I was thinking
she was a Iezzo.

01:07:46.126 --> 01:07:48.084
This is what happens when you
let them watch Sonny & Cher!

01:07:48.167 --> 01:07:49.542
Oh, darling!

01:07:49.626 --> 01:07:50.959
Out in the street
like a prostitute!

01:07:51.126 --> 01:07:52.251
Everybody looking!

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:53.709
Richard, it's just sex.

01:07:53.792 --> 01:07:55.584
Finally, a reason
for birth control!

01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:02.251
They've taken my money
and my bankbook

01:08:02.334 --> 01:08:04.042
and they're talking about
moving.

01:08:04.126 --> 01:08:05.751
You? Over.

01:08:05.834 --> 01:08:06.959
Dad's locked me in my room

01:08:07.042 --> 01:08:10.792
and given Liam permission
to kill me if I try to escape.

01:08:10.876 --> 01:08:12.792
I'm sorry, Jeff. Over.

01:08:13.042 --> 01:08:14.584
Me too.

01:08:14.667 --> 01:08:16.292
Over.

01:08:16.376 --> 01:08:19.167
Is it over? Over.

01:08:21.542 --> 01:08:24.292
It's over. Over.

01:08:25.292 --> 01:08:27.501
- Over and out.
- Over and out.

01:08:37.459 --> 01:08:39.251
So? My parents were tough.

01:08:39.334 --> 01:08:41.792
I was chained to a drainpipe
for stealing a bike,

01:08:41.876 --> 01:08:43.584
and look how I turned out.

01:08:43.667 --> 01:08:46.376
President of the Lions Club
three years running!

01:08:46.459 --> 01:08:48.334
Oh, for God's sake, will you
get your feet off the carpet?!

01:08:48.417 --> 01:08:50.084
Oh, cripes!

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:53.417
Oh, for cryin' out loud!

01:08:56.334 --> 01:08:59.501
- What?!
- Hi. We're a p...

01:08:59.584 --> 01:09:00.792
Mr Marsh?

01:09:01.292 --> 01:09:02.584
Nigel.

01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:05.376
Give Kids a Chance?
We're a charity.

01:09:10.459 --> 01:09:12.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:09:13.001 --> 01:09:15.417
Arggh! Oh!

01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:31.542
Arggh!

01:09:35.084 --> 01:09:36.751
No!

01:10:05.792 --> 01:10:07.459
Yeah, sure.

01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:09.334
- CE-'day, mate.
- Hey, mate.

01:10:11.042 --> 01:10:13.376
- How's that?
- Thanks, Mr Marsh.

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:15.167
Hey, it's good
to see you again.

01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:16.876
- Yeah.
- Bye.

01:10:16.959 --> 01:10:19.751
Oh, and thanks for giving kids
a second chance.

01:10:27.417 --> 01:10:29.626
Oh! Yeah.
Sounds about right.

01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:31.376
I AM a good example.

01:10:37.001 --> 01:10:39.292
Can't get 'em to listen to me.
I could just...

01:10:39.376 --> 01:10:41.667
Can you just...just stop?!

01:10:43.917 --> 01:10:45.042
So...

01:10:45.959 --> 01:10:47.167
...why are we here?

01:10:47.292 --> 01:10:49.084
You know, what's our purpose?

01:10:49.167 --> 01:10:51.084
Eat, shit and die.

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:56.334
Yeah, and along the way, we
bring new life into the world.

01:10:56.417 --> 01:10:58.334
And we set a good example.

01:10:58.417 --> 01:11:00.292
At last count,
I reckon we're all doing

01:11:00.376 --> 01:11:02.001
a pretty crap job of it.

01:11:02.084 --> 01:11:06.084
- Speak for yourself, Bob.
- I am, Gale. I am.

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:08.417
You know,
Swingin' bloody Safari?

01:11:08.501 --> 01:11:11.417
Christ!
What were we thinking?

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:13.834
We're chasing our tails and
our bloody kids can smell it.

01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:15.042
They're all out of control

01:11:15.126 --> 01:11:16.584
and it's up to us
to pull them back into line.

01:11:16.667 --> 01:11:17.667
Exactly. Exactly...

01:11:20.126 --> 01:11:23.417
Whatever you've done, you've
stuffed it up for everyone.

01:11:23.501 --> 01:11:25.251
You're dead meat.

01:11:26.584 --> 01:11:28.459
Shut up!

01:11:29.501 --> 01:11:31.334
Shut up!

01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:33.126
Shut up!

01:11:35.001 --> 01:11:37.084
Just listen to yourselves!

01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:39.917
All raised shit-scared,

01:11:40.001 --> 01:11:42.584
and, gee, that turned out well
for everyone, didn't it?

01:11:44.084 --> 01:11:46.042
The kids shouldn't be punished.

01:11:47.876 --> 01:11:49.667
They should be rewarded.

01:11:49.751 --> 01:11:51.459
Oh, Kaye!

01:11:53.084 --> 01:11:54.709
For Wallaroo parents,

01:11:54.792 --> 01:11:56.751
it's been unusu-whale,
factu-whale,

01:11:56.834 --> 01:11:59.334
but now, unsustaina-whale.

01:12:00.501 --> 01:12:04.376
Now, after
careful consideration,

01:12:04.459 --> 01:12:07.876
we, your...parents,
have decided...

01:12:07.959 --> 01:12:10.834
You're going to
the Blue Light Disco!

01:12:10.917 --> 01:12:12.126
Together.

01:12:12.209 --> 01:12:14.792
Together.

01:12:14.876 --> 01:12:16.667
- Disco!
- Disco!

01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:23.501
Disco!

01:12:23.584 --> 01:12:25.209
Whoo!

01:12:32.667 --> 01:12:34.876
Attention, shoppers.

01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:37.709
Today is children's day.

01:12:37.792 --> 01:12:40.376
All children will be rewarded.

01:12:45.667 --> 01:12:47.376
Welcome to the club, men.

01:12:53.459 --> 01:12:55.126
Eugh!

01:12:55.209 --> 01:12:56.834
Get it into ya.

01:13:01.584 --> 01:13:03.209
Little men.

01:13:03.292 --> 01:13:05.042
That's the way.

01:13:12.626 --> 01:13:16.917
It's true, shoppers.
All children will be rewarded.

01:13:17.584 --> 01:13:19.084
The pill, sweetheart.

01:13:20.667 --> 01:13:22.417
Your father and I
think it's time.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:28.084
- Don't we, Bob?
- Yep.

01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:33.959
Thank you!

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:36.626
Thank you.

01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:39.917
Thank you!

01:13:44.626 --> 01:13:47.709
And, yes, children,
it's true - rewards, rewards!

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:56.167
Hey. Charger!

01:13:56.251 --> 01:13:58.417
Go, boys! Go on!

01:14:06.584 --> 01:14:08.834
Let 'em learn the hard way.

01:14:09.584 --> 01:14:10.709
Shut up.

01:14:10.792 --> 01:14:13.042
- You call this a reward?
- It's a tough world, kids.

01:14:13.126 --> 01:14:15.251
Sometimes tough decisions
have to be made.

01:14:15.334 --> 01:14:16.959
So, say goodbye to Doody.

01:14:17.042 --> 01:14:20.084
- He's going to live on a farm.
- No! Please!

01:14:20.167 --> 01:14:22.584
I know, sweetheart. But you'll
thank us for this one day.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.001
Good bye, Doody.

01:14:25.876 --> 01:14:27.584
Bye, Doody.

01:14:32.042 --> 01:14:34.959
You look like
Engelbert Humperdinck!

01:14:38.751 --> 01:14:40.501
Mum!

01:14:43.209 --> 01:14:46.251
CE-'day, g'day. J0?

01:14:46.334 --> 01:14:47.959
- Ah. CE-'day, Rick.
- CE-'day, mate.

01:14:48.042 --> 01:14:49.751
Here comes the blue-eyed boy.

01:14:49.834 --> 01:14:51.876
Oh! Fabulous.

01:14:51.959 --> 01:14:53.626
- Oh, Gale!
- I know!

01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:55.459
- This is fantastic, isn't it?
- What a screamer.

01:14:55.542 --> 01:14:57.626
Look at you, you dark horse!

01:14:59.417 --> 01:15:01.042
- Gorgeous.
- Yeah.

01:15:01.126 --> 01:15:02.667
Here you go, mate.

01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:06.584
- Oh!
- My little princess.

01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:08.626
Rowr!

01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:11.501
Oh, my.

01:15:11.584 --> 01:15:14.001
Look what we made. Hmm?

01:15:14.834 --> 01:15:18.001
Barbra Streisand
in A Star Is Born!

01:15:18.084 --> 01:15:19.209
Yes.

01:15:19.292 --> 01:15:21.667
- Isn't it?
- Yes!

01:15:23.376 --> 01:15:25.626
There comes a time
in every man's life when...

01:15:27.084 --> 01:15:28.709
Bugger it. Just take 'em.

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:30.417
And you know how to
put 'em on, right?

01:15:30.501 --> 01:15:32.667
'Cause I could take you
to the bathroom and show you.

01:15:32.751 --> 01:15:33.876
No. No.

01:15:33.959 --> 01:15:36.959
There you go.
Oh, Christ, where's the camera?

01:15:37.042 --> 01:15:38.667
- In the car.
- Oh, Christ!

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:40.417
- Go and get it.
- Shall I get it? Alright.

01:15:40.501 --> 01:15:43.876
- I'd like to leave now.
- Yeah.

01:15:43.959 --> 01:15:47.251
I want to tell you
something, alright?

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:51.626
Spontaneity is the key
to pleasure.

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:57.917
A little gift from all of us.

01:15:58.001 --> 01:16:00.084
Go get 'em, tiger.

01:16:06.584 --> 01:16:09.626
Oh, it was only yesterday
they were in floaties!

01:16:13.876 --> 01:16:15.501
Remember your first
dance, Rick?

01:16:15.584 --> 01:16:17.209
Yes, mate. Sharon Lee.

01:16:17.292 --> 01:16:19.126
Got so pissed she didn't
remember a bloody thing.

01:16:19.209 --> 01:16:22.792
What a night.

01:16:22.876 --> 01:16:25.042
- This car smells like prawns.
- Yeah.

01:16:25.126 --> 01:16:26.334
It's not good.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:30.459
After-dinner mint?

01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:41.001
We'll pick youse up
around nine, alright?

01:16:41.084 --> 01:16:42.834
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

01:16:47.584 --> 01:16:48.626
Come on.

01:17:03.042 --> 01:17:05.834
- Do I look OK?
- You look great.

01:17:05.917 --> 01:17:08.209
Youse two look like knobs!

01:17:08.292 --> 01:17:11.751
Oh, stick a sock in it,
Knucklehead!

01:17:11.834 --> 01:17:13.542
Welcome to
the Blue Light Disco.

01:17:13.626 --> 01:17:15.792
- Here. Give it to me.
- Where'd you get that?

01:17:15.876 --> 01:17:17.667
Mum and Dad. Unreal, hey?

01:17:17.751 --> 01:17:19.459
Jeez, I wish I had parents
like yours.

01:17:19.542 --> 01:17:21.209
Jeez, I wish I had
parents like yours.

01:17:21.626 --> 01:17:22.917
Take one and grab a boy.

01:17:23.001 --> 01:17:24.626
- Which boy?
- Doesn't matter.

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:26.459
Just tell him
you're on the pill.

01:17:29.959 --> 01:17:31.084
I'm on the pill.

01:17:38.292 --> 01:17:39.292
Want to dance?

01:17:40.376 --> 01:17:41.584
No.

01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:58.459
Ooh!

01:18:02.376 --> 01:18:03.834
Want to get out of here?

01:18:10.084 --> 01:18:11.667
I'm on the pill.

01:18:18.959 --> 01:18:20.626
She's just like you and me.

01:18:22.126 --> 01:18:25.084
Stuck here. Rotting.

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:27.084
And they'll never
let her get away.

01:18:28.209 --> 01:18:29.459
Tommy got away.

01:18:35.542 --> 01:18:37.251
- Eugh!
- What's it like?

01:18:37.334 --> 01:18:38.542
Awful.

01:18:48.209 --> 01:18:50.042
Is this it?

01:18:50.126 --> 01:18:52.834
We're gonna be grown-ups soon,
like our parents.

01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:56.959
It's not like the movies,
is it?

01:18:58.459 --> 01:19:00.167
Maybe she's trying
to tell us something.

01:19:02.001 --> 01:19:04.751
If our parents have everything,
why are they so miserable?

01:19:19.751 --> 01:19:22.626
- What do you reckon?
- Piece of piss.

01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:24.626
Get rid of it in about
three seconds.

01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:26.542
Seagulls do the rest.

01:19:34.501 --> 01:19:36.792
Christ, it's almost 9:00.
We gotta go. Come on.

01:19:36.876 --> 01:19:38.542
Come on. Come on!

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.667
Stop. We've got to go back.

01:19:42.751 --> 01:19:44.417
- No, we need to leave now.
- What about the whale?

01:19:44.501 --> 01:19:46.167
No, we've just got to get out
of these damn clothes

01:19:46.251 --> 01:19:47.876
and just go...we'll go back...

01:19:47.959 --> 01:19:49.584
Hey, lovebirds.

01:19:49.667 --> 01:19:51.292
Hey, are you having fun,
Engelbert?

01:19:51.376 --> 01:19:53.334
Yeah. Great. Happy it's over.

01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:55.084
Who says it's over?

01:20:36.626 --> 01:20:38.251
Love you.

01:21:24.542 --> 01:21:26.126
Stop, Melly.

01:21:29.959 --> 01:21:31.126
Come.

01:21:32.292 --> 01:21:33.292
Put your arms around me.

01:21:36.584 --> 01:21:37.792
Like your nanna.

01:22:15.459 --> 01:22:16.709
Come on, love.

01:22:18.459 --> 01:22:19.876
- Morning, morning, morning.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:22:19.959 --> 01:22:21.584
- Hey, mate.
- Hey, Rick.

01:22:21.667 --> 01:22:22.917
How'd it go?

01:22:23.459 --> 01:22:25.917
It sounded like the bloody
walls of Jericho coming down.

01:22:26.001 --> 01:22:27.667
Oh, shit!

01:22:27.751 --> 01:22:30.126
- Stop it! Shush!
- Alright!

01:22:40.251 --> 01:22:42.834
Let's get this over with.

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:45.959
- Right?
- Couldn't agree more, mate.

01:22:46.042 --> 01:22:47.709
Springboks - best team in
the world. Why can't we watch?

01:22:47.792 --> 01:22:50.209
I don't agree with that.
Not at all.

01:22:50.292 --> 01:22:52.001
I just want
to watch rugby.

01:22:52.084 --> 01:22:54.542
Let's go and talk
to them. Yoo-hoo!

01:22:54.626 --> 01:22:56.792
- Hello.
- Hello, darling.

01:22:58.001 --> 01:22:59.001
Did you have a good night?

01:22:59.084 --> 01:23:01.626
Cripes! Look at the time.
Better get a move on.

01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:03.459
Yeah. Big news
down at the beach.

01:23:03.542 --> 01:23:05.626
Your whale is all over
the telly.

01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:08.001
Christ, he's right.
We've gotta get a park.

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:09.709
Every bugger and his dog
will be down there!

01:23:09.792 --> 01:23:11.417
Come on, then.
We've gotta beat the queue.

01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:13.292
- Gonna be a bloody nightmare.
- Come on, love.

01:23:13.376 --> 01:23:15.584
Now there's two lanes and
BOTH bloody lanes are packed!

01:23:15.667 --> 01:23:17.417
Oh, my boy.

01:23:23.251 --> 01:23:26.251
Everybody clear off!
This is your last warning!

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:27.959
This is a blast zone!

01:23:28.042 --> 01:23:30.209
For the last time, move back!

01:23:30.292 --> 01:23:33.876
Sod the lot of youse! Hope you
all get blown to kingdom come!

01:23:33.959 --> 01:23:36.209
Hey. You getting a good shot
there, tiger?

01:23:36.292 --> 01:23:38.417
- Yeah, Dad.
- On ya, son.

01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:41.042
You see? That's why
we had to beat the traffic.

01:23:41.126 --> 01:23:44.292
Look at us.
Winners are grinners.

01:23:44.376 --> 01:23:47.167
Every news crew. Let's just
hope that it all goes to plan.

01:23:47.251 --> 01:23:49.042
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

01:23:52.167 --> 01:23:54.459
Every news crew in Australia.

01:23:54.542 --> 01:23:56.584
Don't take any chances.

01:23:56.667 --> 01:23:59.459
- Make sure you get rid of it.
- You're the boss.

01:24:00.751 --> 01:24:01.751
Hey, boys!

01:24:03.167 --> 01:24:04.376
Double it!

01:24:04.459 --> 01:24:07.834
- Yeah, tops.
- Double it, boys.

01:24:07.917 --> 01:24:11.292
Looking at it from this angle,
it's just massive.

01:24:11.376 --> 01:24:13.834
It's a...massive mammal.

01:24:13.917 --> 01:24:15.709
It's a dead whale, not a fish.

01:24:17.042 --> 01:24:19.126
You see?
That's why I get here early.

01:24:19.209 --> 01:24:22.376
Hey, Keith. Keith! Over here.
Saved you a possie.

01:24:22.542 --> 01:24:24.834
- Sorry we're late.
- Position A.

01:24:24.917 --> 01:24:27.792
Gerome's driving the porcelain
bus like a right nong.

01:24:27.876 --> 01:24:29.709
I think I'm gonna spew again.

01:24:29.792 --> 01:24:31.626
Hair of the dog. Drink it.

01:24:33.792 --> 01:24:35.459
Get it into ya, mate.
Good for ya.

01:24:35.542 --> 01:24:37.251
Come on, suck it up.

01:24:47.334 --> 01:24:48.792
Found a better view?

01:24:53.376 --> 01:24:55.376
I'm sorry.

01:24:58.876 --> 01:25:00.209
I don't know what happened.

01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:03.542
Maybe...

01:25:06.376 --> 01:25:08.126
Maybe I was just too nervous.

01:25:15.834 --> 01:25:18.792
Maybe you were just
looking out for me.

01:25:22.626 --> 01:25:24.459
Do you still want to go
to Melbourne?

01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:28.084
Race you.

01:25:31.667 --> 01:25:32.959
Come on.

01:25:34.667 --> 01:25:36.292
What do you reckon will happen?

01:25:36.376 --> 01:25:39.542
I don't know.
It's gonna be a mess, though.

01:25:39.626 --> 01:25:40.667
Aww!

01:25:46.126 --> 01:25:49.876
The big fish, christened Chips
by the boys at the station,

01:25:49.959 --> 01:25:52.209
is about to spend his last day
in paradise

01:25:52.292 --> 01:25:55.417
thanks to Mayor Bradley
Brimshaw's final solution.

01:25:55.501 --> 01:25:56.959
Our friend could have picked

01:25:57.042 --> 01:25:59.459
any strip of sand in the
country to end his days,

01:25:59.542 --> 01:26:02.084
and he wisely chose ours -

01:26:02.167 --> 01:26:06.251
1975's Tidy Town winner!

01:26:06.334 --> 01:26:08.459
That's a good one, that one.

01:26:08.542 --> 01:26:10.417
Our glorious beach
is about to get even tidier.

01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:13.459
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Nigel.

01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:14.834
...boys and girls,

01:26:14.917 --> 01:26:17.959
bid a hearty farewell

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:21.501
to our great blue whale.

01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:38.334
The whale's gone!

01:26:38.542 --> 01:26:40.251
Goodbye, whale!

01:26:46.126 --> 01:26:47.876
What a fucking fizzer.

01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:51.584
She did it!
She finally escaped!

01:27:01.751 --> 01:27:02.751
Oh!

01:27:05.959 --> 01:27:07.584
<i>'</i> Eugh!
<i>~</i> Oh!

01:27:07.667 --> 01:27:09.001
Oh! Oh!

01:27:12.042 --> 01:27:13.709
Oh! Eugh! Eugh!

01:27:13.792 --> 01:27:16.334
Oh! Shit a brick! Run!

01:27:20.251 --> 01:27:21.251
Shit!

01:27:31.042 --> 01:27:32.334
Ohhh!

01:29:03.542 --> 01:29:08.959
<i>S' Ah... S'</i>

01:29:29.001 --> 01:29:31.792
So, if this is
the decade that defined us,

01:29:31.876 --> 01:29:33.751
then it ended with
two superheroes

01:29:33.834 --> 01:29:36.417
and two tonnes of dynamite.

01:29:37.459 --> 01:29:40.167
Melly and I took flight
and never looked back.

01:29:43.167 --> 01:29:45.834
Don't get me wrong -
I loved my childhood.

01:29:45.917 --> 01:29:47.542
Our parents did
the best they could

01:29:47.626 --> 01:29:49.542
with the bent tools
they were handed.

01:29:49.626 --> 01:29:52.626
And the upshot of trying
to force a kid into manhood

01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:54.376
with a packet of condoms

01:29:54.459 --> 01:29:57.084
was the licence
to be a 14-year-old

01:29:57.167 --> 01:29:59.584
for the rest of his
fabulous life.

01:30:02.292 --> 01:30:05.126
When people ask me
what happened in the 1970s,

01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:07.292
I've got a simple answer...

01:30:18.876 --> 01:30:20.626
You should have just left
her at the airport, honestly.

01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:24.209
Because we come here to have
a holiday, a family holiday,

01:30:24.292 --> 01:30:26.126
and you just...
all you've done is yell

01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:29.917
and sit there and look fat
in your purple togs.

01:30:30.001 --> 01:30:32.751
Fiji is a dump! I told you
we should have gone to Tonga!

01:30:32.917 --> 01:30:34.459
Here, sir!
Look what I found here.

01:30:34.542 --> 01:30:36.251
Look how beautiful
this turtle is.

01:30:36.334 --> 01:30:38.584
Hey, come, look what I found.
Look at this.

01:30:40.167 --> 01:30:42.334
Has he got a hole drilled
in his shell?

01:30:42.501 --> 01:30:44.001
Yes, he does.

01:30:45.209 --> 01:30:46.709
It's Tommy!

01:30:46.792 --> 01:30:49.167
He used to live opposite
Mum and Dad.

01:30:49.251 --> 01:30:51.084
We have to take him back.

01:31:06.209 --> 01:31:07.917
OK. Are you recording?

01:33:41.376 --> 01:33:42.876
Go, Mama!

01:36:12.001 --> 01:36:13.376
Oh, shit!
