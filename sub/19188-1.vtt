01:22.292 --> 01:24.669
<i>They say that history
is written by the victors.</i>

01:25.420 --> 01:28.381
<i>This, then, is the history
of the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

01:28.506 --> 01:31.342
<i>formed by crusading scientist
Professor James Marcus.</i>

01:32.969 --> 01:34.763
<i>Marcus had a young daughter, Alicia,</i>

01:34.846 --> 01:38.475
<i>afflicted with Progeria,
a progressive, fatal, wasting disease.</i>

01:38.683 --> 01:40.727
<i>Progeria caused premature aging.</i>

01:41.186 --> 01:43.021
<i>By the time she was 25,</i>

01:43.229 --> 01:45.565
<i>Alicia would have the body of a 90-year-old.</i>

01:46.441 --> 01:48.234
<i>Marcus was driven to save her,</i>

01:48.860 --> 01:50.695
<i>but the odds seemed impossible.</i>

01:51.196 --> 01:53.782
<i>And even as he worked desperately
to create a cure,</i>

01:53.907 --> 01:55.909
<i>the young girl's father
would record his daughter,</i>

01:56.409 --> 01:58.828
<i>her voice, her likeness,</i>

01:58.995 --> 02:00.455
<i>saving her for posterity.</i>

02:02.207 --> 02:03.500
<i>But then the breakthrough came.</i>

02:03.625 --> 02:05.919
<i>Marcus discovered the T-virus.</i>

02:06.544 --> 02:10.298
<i>Once injected, it would detect and repair
damaged cells within the body.</i>

02:11.424 --> 02:12.801
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

02:12.967 --> 02:15.762
<i>The life of Alicia Marcus was saved.</i>

02:16.554 --> 02:18.765
<i>The T-virus had a myriad of applications,</i>

02:18.973 --> 02:21.059
<i>treating 1,000 different diseases.</i>

02:21.309 --> 02:24.103
<i>Overnight, it seemed a new era was dawning,</i>

02:24.187 --> 02:28.191
<i>a world without the fear of infection,
sickness or decay.</i>

02:29.901 --> 02:31.402
<i>But it was not to be,</i>

02:31.653 --> 02:35.114
<i>for the T-virus
had certain unforeseen side effects.</i>

02:45.500 --> 02:46.960
Sir, sir, over here!

02:48.169 --> 02:49.295
Hey.

02:51.756 --> 02:52.924
He's not breathing.

03:21.077 --> 03:22.829
<i>The first of the undead was born.</i>

03:24.038 --> 03:25.748
<i>The incident was quickly covered up.</i>

03:26.165 --> 03:28.668
<i>In the aftermath,
James Marcus argued furiously</i>

03:28.751 --> 03:30.169
<i>with his business partner,</i>

03:30.420 --> 03:32.380
<i>Dr. Alexander Isaacs.</i>

03:32.463 --> 03:35.883
I don't care how much it costs,
we have to close the program down.

03:35.967 --> 03:38.428
James, we're gonna be ruined.

03:39.012 --> 03:40.221
My mind is made up.

03:42.432 --> 03:43.641
Pity.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.362
Off to bed, Alicia.

03:56.821 --> 03:58.448
Your father and I are just talking.

04:00.450 --> 04:01.618
Go on.

04:10.293 --> 04:13.421
<i>Dr. Isaacs became the guardian
of his dead partner's child</i>

04:13.504 --> 04:16.257
<i>and her half of the company.</i>

04:16.548 --> 04:19.385
<i>The corporation that had begun
with such lofty ideals</i>

04:19.927 --> 04:23.056
<i>had been seduced completely
by greed and power.</i>

04:25.558 --> 04:29.228
<i>To help him control the now-vast interests
of the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

04:29.896 --> 04:32.732
<i>Dr. Isaacs created
a powerful artificial intelligence.</i>

04:34.067 --> 04:37.528
<i>Isaacs used the likeness of Alicia Marcus
for the computer's interface.</i>

04:38.613 --> 04:42.075
<i>Isaacs called the computer "the Red Queen."</i>

04:44.202 --> 04:46.454
<i>Then, 10 years ago in Raccoon City,</i>

04:46.788 --> 04:48.122
<i>there was an outbreak.</i>

04:48.414 --> 04:50.708
<i>A T-virus escaped
from an underground laboratory</i>

04:50.792 --> 04:52.085
<i>called the Hive.</i>

04:52.752 --> 04:55.046
<i>The American government
attempted to contain the outbreak</i>

04:55.129 --> 04:56.714
<i>by detonating a bomb.</i>

04:57.090 --> 04:59.092
<i>It devastated Raccoon City,</i>

04:59.258 --> 05:01.135
<i>but it couldn't stop the airborne infection.</i>

05:01.719 --> 05:04.972
<i>The viral outbreak
spread across the world within days.</i>

05:05.473 --> 05:08.101
<i>Humankind was brought to its knees.</i>

05:08.768 --> 05:12.730
<i>Finally, the last and best hope
of humanity gathered</i>

05:12.814 --> 05:14.982
<i>and took a last stand in Washington,
D.C.</i>

05:15.650 --> 05:18.319
<i>But we didn't realize
that what we had walked into</i>

05:18.695 --> 05:20.071
was a trap.

05:20.154 --> 05:23.074
My name is Alice, and this is my story.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.868
The end of my story.

08:21.878 --> 08:22.920
Come on!

12:01.764 --> 12:03.390
Hello?

12:16.153 --> 12:18.072
Is there anyone alive in here?

12:28.332 --> 12:29.834
Hello?

13:41.530 --> 13:42.698
You come here to gloat?

13:42.865 --> 13:47.244
<i>My satellites show
there are 4,472 humans remaining</i>

13:47.328 --> 13:50.247
<i>on the surface of the Earth.
They will cease to exist</i>

13:50.331 --> 13:52.208
<i>in under 48 hours.</i>

13:52.917 --> 13:54.001
What do you want from me?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.295
You want me to say that you've won?

13:56.837 --> 13:59.423
- You've wiped out humanity.
<i>- No. Quite the opposite.</i>

13:59.506 --> 14:01.258
<i>I want you to stop me...</i>

14:01.342 --> 14:03.719
<i>To stop me... Stop... I want you to stop me.</i>

14:04.887 --> 14:05.888
<i>Behind you.</i>

14:18.108 --> 14:19.276
<i>Nicely done.</i>

14:19.485 --> 14:20.736
I don't trust you.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.614
<i>Given our history, I'd be surprised if you did.</i>

14:23.697 --> 14:26.700
<i>But unless you intervene,
the slaughter will be complete.</i>

14:26.825 --> 14:28.494
<i>There will be no survivors.</i>

14:28.869 --> 14:30.371
How can I possibly help them?

14:30.621 --> 14:33.249
<i>Umbrella developed an airborne antivirus.</i>

14:35.084 --> 14:37.503
<i>If released, it would destroy the T-virus</i>

14:37.711 --> 14:40.047
<i>and anything it has infected, on contact.</i>

14:41.048 --> 14:42.258
All this could end?

14:42.341 --> 14:43.550
<i>Precisely.</i>

14:43.926 --> 14:45.177
Where is this antivirus?

14:45.302 --> 14:48.097
<i>Beneath the streets of Raccoon City,
in the Hive.</i>

14:48.722 --> 14:49.848
Why would you help me?

14:49.932 --> 14:53.477
<i>My programming will not allow me
to harm the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

14:53.644 --> 14:56.230
<i>but you are bound by no such constraints.</i>

14:56.605 --> 15:00.067
You'd turn against Umbrella,
against the people who created you?

15:00.651 --> 15:01.652
Why?

15:01.735 --> 15:04.613
<i>Get to Raccoon City in 48 hours,</i>

15:04.697 --> 15:07.616
<i>make it to the Hive,
and then you'll have your answer.</i>

15:08.492 --> 15:10.494
I have no reason to believe a word you say.

15:10.786 --> 15:13.914
<i>True. But I can offer you
something you want very much.</i>

15:14.373 --> 15:15.374
What is that?

15:15.457 --> 15:16.542
<i>Revenge.</i>

15:16.792 --> 15:18.043
<i>Wesker.</i>

15:18.460 --> 15:20.713
<i>He led you all here to Washington.</i>

15:20.921 --> 15:23.257
<i>He pretended to give you your powers back,</i>

15:23.674 --> 15:25.551
<i>and then he betrayed you.</i>

15:26.802 --> 15:28.012
Where is he?

15:28.262 --> 15:29.888
<i>He just landed at the Hive.</i>

15:29.972 --> 15:31.849
<i>I'm resetting your watch.</i>

15:34.977 --> 15:36.812
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

15:39.356 --> 15:40.399
<i>Alice.</i>

15:41.775 --> 15:44.903
<i>Ten years ago in the Hive, we both failed.</i>

15:45.070 --> 15:46.363
<i>We let this happen.</i>

15:47.740 --> 15:48.907
<i>Make it right.</i>

18:08.881 --> 18:10.340
Is that all you got?

19:07.397 --> 19:08.607
<i>Alice.</i>

19:12.653 --> 19:14.112
<i>Ten years ago in the Hive...</i>

19:14.238 --> 19:15.822
<i>There will be no survivors.</i>

19:15.906 --> 19:17.407
<i>There will be no survivors.</i>

19:30.879 --> 19:32.172
What is this place?

19:33.590 --> 19:35.509
Where am I? Answer me.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.553
- What's wrong with you?
- Be quiet.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.390
- Who did this?
- Quiet! I told you.

19:50.274 --> 19:51.483
Silence.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.242
So, you're awake at last.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.536
I killed you.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.539
- Yet here I am.
- A clone.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.083
I killed your clone.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.544
You've been most troublesome to me.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.005
You and your sisters.

20:18.677 --> 20:19.803
And now I have you.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.851
The cleansing operation
should have finished over a year ago,

20:25.976 --> 20:27.311
but you slowed us down.

20:28.270 --> 20:31.189
So much so that I was obliged
to take command myself.

20:31.523 --> 20:32.816
You could end all of this.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.777
Why don't you?

20:36.111 --> 20:37.321
Interesting.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.950
Someone told you something, didn't they?

20:45.787 --> 20:49.249
Well, you will be begging
to tell me soon enough.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.295
She's an unbeliever.

20:54.463 --> 20:56.590
What do we do with unbelievers?

20:57.716 --> 20:58.925
Cast her out.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.428
Cast her out.

21:02.012 --> 21:05.515
Cast her out! Cast her out!

21:05.599 --> 21:07.601
- Come on!
- Cast her out!

21:07.934 --> 21:10.771
Cast her out! Cast her out!

21:10.896 --> 21:15.317
Cast her out! Cast her out!
Cast her out! Cast her out!

22:01.822 --> 22:04.241
The Lord created a flood
to cleanse the Earth.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.120
40 days and 40 nights of rain.

22:08.370 --> 22:11.706
Our method has taken a little longer,
but the result will be the same.

22:12.207 --> 22:15.877
A world ready for the righteous
and the pure to inherit.

22:20.507 --> 22:24.344
We reach Raccoon City in just over 12 hours.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.765
I doubt even you can run for that long.

22:29.850 --> 22:31.726
I want to know what you know.

22:33.937 --> 22:35.605
Tell me when she's ready to talk.

22:45.824 --> 22:48.326
<i>- Wesker.</i>
- Dr. Isaacs.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.329
<i>Look what I found on the roadside.</i>

22:53.999 --> 22:55.625
<i>It would appear your mission to Washington</i>

22:55.709 --> 22:57.252
<i>was less successful than you made out.</i>

22:57.752 --> 22:59.421
<i>- Impossible.</i>
- I hope you didn't leave

22:59.504 --> 23:00.755
any other loose ends.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.508
There's something else.

23:04.509 --> 23:07.637
I think she knows
about the airborne antivirus.

23:07.762 --> 23:10.515
<i>- How can that be?</i>
- I don't know yet.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.518
But we caught her
on the road to Raccoon City.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.729
<i>Why else would she be headed there?</i>

23:16.354 --> 23:18.857
Raise the security level
at the Hive to maximum.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.400
No one in or out.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.235
I'll let you know when she talks.

23:22.652 --> 23:23.987
God go with you.

23:25.697 --> 23:26.907
You heard him.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.450
Security level to maximum.

23:28.533 --> 23:29.910
<i>As you wish.</i>

23:56.269 --> 23:57.729
Get up there and check it out.

25:17.475 --> 25:18.518
Release me!

25:19.978 --> 25:22.522
- Open them.
- All right. All right.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.899
You can't use it. You can't escape.

26:22.749 --> 26:23.917
Move!

27:28.398 --> 27:29.441
Jesus.

27:29.858 --> 27:30.984
Jesus.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.194
Jesus.

27:37.031 --> 27:38.241
Sir.

27:39.409 --> 27:40.410
She's gone.

27:41.995 --> 27:42.996
I won't forgive her.

28:01.848 --> 28:04.476
<i>Target is 72 miles and closing.</i>

28:05.018 --> 28:07.854
Lock down the Hive,
prepare defensive measures,

28:08.646 --> 28:10.440
and alert our operative in Raccoon City.

28:43.932 --> 28:45.225
Welcome home.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.971
<i>...an airborne antivirus...</i>

29:23.888 --> 29:25.473
<i>...under 48 hours...</i>

29:26.182 --> 29:28.142
<i>Make... Make... Make it to the Hive.</i>

29:37.318 --> 29:39.153
Let him go! Let him go now!

29:39.404 --> 29:40.697
Put it down or we'll shoot!

29:42.282 --> 29:43.366
I told you, Doc!

29:43.449 --> 29:45.618
- Calm down, Christian!
- I told you you were wrong!

29:45.702 --> 29:46.995
- Calm down.
- We should have killed her

29:47.078 --> 29:49.205
- when we had the chance!
- Put it down, please,

29:49.289 --> 29:52.000
- before he tries to shoot the both of us.
- What's in this?

29:52.375 --> 29:54.961
- Pure adrenaline. I needed you awake.
- Why?

29:55.378 --> 29:56.421
There's something coming,

29:56.504 --> 29:58.214
in the same direction you came,
something big.

29:58.339 --> 30:00.842
Let him go! Put it down. Now.

30:03.720 --> 30:04.846
Alice?

30:12.353 --> 30:14.272
Umbrella captured me at the Arcadia.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.274
We were headed somewhere called the Hive.

30:16.357 --> 30:18.276
Got loose, killed the pilot, crashed here.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.404
Doc and the others pulled me from the crash.

30:22.238 --> 30:23.948
- I owe them my life.
- Doc!

30:25.491 --> 30:27.201
There, to the east.

30:27.368 --> 30:28.745
Still headed our way.

30:30.413 --> 30:31.623
You know what it is?

30:33.124 --> 30:35.126
Umbrella. Dr. Isaacs.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.461
I thought that you killed him.

30:37.545 --> 30:38.796
I thought so, too.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.965
He has an army of undead with him.

30:41.424 --> 30:42.717
They'll be here within hours.

30:43.426 --> 30:44.427
What do we do?

30:44.552 --> 30:45.887
Why the hell are we asking her?

30:46.387 --> 30:48.264
She's a stranger. We shouldn't trust her.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.266
- Listen to me, Claire.
- Hey, hey, hey, Christian!

30:50.350 --> 30:52.226
- Don't you touch me, Doc!
- Put it down!

30:52.310 --> 30:54.354
- You put it down! You put it down!
- Christian! Hey!

30:54.437 --> 30:55.688
Hey. Look at me.

30:55.772 --> 30:58.232
Just 'cause you think
you should be in charge doesn't make it so.

30:58.316 --> 30:59.317
Just... Hey.

31:03.655 --> 31:05.740
You listen to me, Doc. You're gonna regret it.

31:06.324 --> 31:07.450
All of you!

31:08.826 --> 31:10.370
All of you!

31:22.256 --> 31:23.716
I have to get to the Hive.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.636
You have to get these people out of here.

31:26.719 --> 31:29.305
We have children, injured, the elderly.

31:29.806 --> 31:31.599
You know, what chance
do they have on the open road?

31:31.683 --> 31:32.684
Better than they have here.

31:32.767 --> 31:35.186
- This building is secure.
- Maybe from the undead,

31:36.104 --> 31:37.897
but Isaacs has armored vehicles,

31:38.064 --> 31:40.358
rocket launchers, heavy ordnance.

31:40.525 --> 31:42.819
They're gonna tear this place wide open.

31:45.363 --> 31:47.281
- Doc!
- Okay, okay.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.375
So, what happened to her?

31:57.959 --> 32:00.253
She was hit by one of the traps
on the outer perimeter.

32:00.628 --> 32:01.754
They were intended for the undead.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.344
- What is this?
- Specialty of the house.

32:08.428 --> 32:10.013
Have you on your feet in no time.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.389
Why should I trust you?

32:17.061 --> 32:18.312
Here.

32:24.569 --> 32:26.487
Doc, we need to get out of here.

32:26.571 --> 32:28.698
People are scared,
and Christian's not helping.

32:29.699 --> 32:31.284
You need to let people know
what's happening.

32:31.367 --> 32:32.535
Okay.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.371
I've got to go.

32:37.206 --> 32:38.249
Hey.

32:38.332 --> 32:39.584
Your friend's gonna be okay.

32:40.835 --> 32:42.086
Thank you.

32:47.884 --> 32:49.886
- You know, he and I...
- I noticed.

32:51.054 --> 32:52.430
So, what's in the Hive?

32:53.222 --> 32:55.183
Umbrella developed a cure,

32:55.808 --> 32:57.643
an airborne antivirus.

32:58.436 --> 33:01.647
It'll destroy anything infected
with the T-virus on contact.

33:01.939 --> 33:03.191
Who told you this?

33:03.399 --> 33:05.443
- The Red Queen.
- And you believed her?

33:06.360 --> 33:09.113
- What if we can end all this?
- What about you?

33:09.363 --> 33:11.324
They infected you with the T-virus.

33:12.492 --> 33:14.869
You release this antivirus,
it's going to kill you.

33:14.952 --> 33:17.205
- Whatever it takes.
- Alice, I'm not...

33:17.288 --> 33:18.623
You know I'm right.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.503
All right.

33:26.089 --> 33:29.133
We stop Isaacs here, we save these people,

33:29.759 --> 33:31.094
and then we go together.

33:33.596 --> 33:34.764
We don't have long.

33:37.141 --> 33:38.351
Let's get to it.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.201
What else do you have for defense?

33:55.284 --> 33:58.287
Not too many firearms,
but we have a big supply of gasoline.

33:58.996 --> 34:00.540
Here, you need a weapon.

34:00.998 --> 34:03.501
- We're giving her a gun now?
- Take it easy, Christian.

34:03.668 --> 34:05.294
You can let your guard down
if you want, man.

34:05.378 --> 34:06.546
I don't intend to.

34:10.675 --> 34:12.592
When I rode in here,
someone was watching me.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.679
They could have called out or fired a shot

34:14.762 --> 34:16.556
to warn me about the trap, but they didn't.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.224
What are you saying?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.268
Watch your back.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.864
<i>So, Dr. Isaacs,</i>

34:33.947 --> 34:36.033
it seems you let her
slip through your fingers.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.284
<i>Or what remains of them.</i>

34:37.368 --> 34:38.995
Don't forget who you're talking to.

34:39.954 --> 34:40.955
Where is she?

34:41.080 --> 34:42.206
<i>The settlement in Raccoon City.</i>

34:42.456 --> 34:45.333
<i>Our informant reports
that she's preparing for a fight.</i>

34:45.458 --> 34:46.627
Good.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.670
I'll be there in the hour.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.114
That's it, keep moving!

35:17.033 --> 35:18.868
We need all the gasoline cans over there.

35:21.829 --> 35:23.915
- Over here!
- On my way!

35:24.165 --> 35:26.500
- Claire said you built this.
- Yeah, that's right.

35:27.919 --> 35:29.462
This used to be a window washer.

35:30.963 --> 35:34.008
- I made a couple of changes.
- Where'd you learn to do that?

35:34.091 --> 35:37.094
My father used to run a chop shop. I hated it.

35:37.261 --> 35:40.264
Who knew?
I guess I was paying attention after all.

35:40.598 --> 35:43.392
Good, because I'm gonna need you
to make a few more changes

35:43.476 --> 35:44.852
to this thing.

36:07.375 --> 36:08.793
Ready the weapons.

36:08.876 --> 36:10.378
High-explosive rounds.

36:11.087 --> 36:12.421
No survivors.

36:25.268 --> 36:26.435
He's here.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.312
They're coming!

36:29.146 --> 36:30.523
Close the gates!

36:47.790 --> 36:48.916
My God.

36:50.084 --> 36:51.085
It's an army.

36:56.841 --> 36:58.551
What are we gonna do?

36:59.051 --> 37:00.052
Yeah.

37:01.345 --> 37:02.596
What are we gonna do?

37:03.639 --> 37:05.516
We're gonna kill every last one of them.

37:17.570 --> 37:18.988
Prepare to fire!

37:32.168 --> 37:33.586
Get ready.

37:35.588 --> 37:37.506
- Light her up!
- Up top.

37:48.642 --> 37:50.686
- Fire!
- Fire!

38:04.283 --> 38:05.910
- Damn her.
- Reload.

38:08.537 --> 38:10.664
Close it up. Full stop.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.418
Release the bait.

38:19.382 --> 38:20.674
There's a survivor.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.593
- Open the gate.
- Open the gate!

38:23.886 --> 38:25.721
Open fire!

38:26.263 --> 38:27.515
Keep them off her.

38:30.559 --> 38:31.811
Marker two.

38:35.815 --> 38:37.191
- Fire!
- Fire!

38:47.618 --> 38:49.286
Claire, Doc, get out there. Bring her in.

38:56.710 --> 38:57.795
Come on.

38:58.879 --> 38:59.922
Wait.

39:01.132 --> 39:02.133
She's almost there.

39:04.301 --> 39:05.511
Fire.

39:07.805 --> 39:08.806
Damn you.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.391
Close the gate now.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.027
Claire, they've breached the gate.

39:29.452 --> 39:30.536
Claire!

39:39.211 --> 39:40.296
Fire.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.305
Razor, now!

39:49.388 --> 39:50.890
Right! You heard her!

39:51.432 --> 39:52.683
Now, push!

40:01.233 --> 40:02.401
Move!

40:12.828 --> 40:15.122
Abandon the gate.
Pull back to the barricades.

40:15.247 --> 40:17.082
Looks like she's out of tricks.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.001
Target the roof.

40:21.212 --> 40:22.379
Everybody get down!

40:24.423 --> 40:25.424
Now!

40:51.534 --> 40:52.993
Alice, we're at the barricades.

40:53.077 --> 40:54.662
Claire, you have to hold them there.

41:21.438 --> 41:22.648
Come on!

41:30.364 --> 41:31.365
Doc!

41:55.222 --> 41:57.808
- Alice, we can't hold on much longer.
- Get out of there now.

42:39.058 --> 42:40.351
Back up.

42:40.726 --> 42:41.727
Now!

43:03.332 --> 43:04.625
Bring all guns to bear.

43:09.755 --> 43:10.839
Fire.

43:14.927 --> 43:16.095
Where is she?

43:17.930 --> 43:19.056
Where did she go?

43:21.308 --> 43:22.559
Find her.

43:30.067 --> 43:31.652
Close the vents now!

43:45.165 --> 43:46.166
Don't shoot.

44:37.176 --> 44:38.343
You're fast.

44:39.011 --> 44:40.387
But you're not too smart.

45:14.004 --> 45:15.839
No. Don't shoot, please.

45:16.131 --> 45:17.841
- Where is he?
- That way.

45:30.229 --> 45:32.397
- Save your ammo.
- There's too many of these things

45:32.481 --> 45:33.732
still out here.

45:33.941 --> 45:35.108
I'll take care of it.

45:37.903 --> 45:39.029
No.

45:40.823 --> 45:41.990
Move out.

45:42.699 --> 45:43.784
Let's go!

45:44.409 --> 45:45.744
Enjoy the ride.

46:04.972 --> 46:06.515
<i>- Guys?</i>
- Go.

46:06.640 --> 46:07.975
<i>There's something here you gotta see.</i>

46:09.226 --> 46:12.062
Two more armies of undead
headed straight for us.

46:12.813 --> 46:14.273
There, on the horizon.

46:16.942 --> 46:18.193
And a second over there.

46:21.154 --> 46:22.906
We're out of gasoline. We're defenseless.

46:24.157 --> 46:25.909
We have to make it to the Hive.

46:26.034 --> 46:28.453
- It's our only chance now.
- I'm coming with you.

46:28.871 --> 46:30.372
- Count me in.
- Me, too.

46:30.747 --> 46:31.957
And me.

46:32.291 --> 46:34.668
So I was wrong about you. Blow me.

46:42.426 --> 46:44.136
We know where you're going.

46:44.511 --> 46:45.929
Into the pit.

46:46.722 --> 46:48.056
We wanna come.

46:49.933 --> 46:51.101
Please.

46:52.394 --> 46:53.562
Grab some gear.

46:54.187 --> 46:55.439
You're gonna need it.

47:16.126 --> 47:17.711
- There.
- What is it?

47:18.003 --> 47:19.755
The part of the Hive exposed by the blast.

47:20.297 --> 47:21.340
That's our way in.

47:40.817 --> 47:41.818
Let's move!

47:41.902 --> 47:43.028
I'll take point.

48:06.593 --> 48:08.261
Activate security measures now.

48:08.345 --> 48:11.723
<i>Hive security fully activated and automated.</i>

48:11.848 --> 48:14.434
No. Disengage automation.

48:15.102 --> 48:16.770
I'll handle the defenses myself.

48:16.853 --> 48:18.563
<i>The defenses would be more efficient</i>

48:18.647 --> 48:20.649
<i>if I retained control of them.</i>

48:22.025 --> 48:23.276
Really?

48:23.527 --> 48:26.405
I seem to remember last time she was here,
she walked out alive.

48:27.406 --> 48:29.491
I don't intend to make that same mistake.

48:29.574 --> 48:32.703
<i>As you wish.
Hive defenses are now in your hands.</i>

48:35.205 --> 48:36.540
Unleash the Cerberus.

48:36.832 --> 48:39.793
<i>Cerberus are in play...
Are in play... Are in play...</i>

48:44.256 --> 48:46.174
You have someone before all this?

48:47.300 --> 48:48.885
Husband? Family?

48:50.387 --> 48:51.471
I can't remember.

48:51.805 --> 48:53.015
How is that possible?

48:53.098 --> 48:54.891
I woke up just when all this was starting.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.602
I can't recall much before that.

48:58.186 --> 49:00.564
Sometimes I feel like
this has been my whole life.

49:00.647 --> 49:01.898
Running,

49:02.816 --> 49:03.900
killing.

49:15.829 --> 49:16.830
What is it?

49:17.164 --> 49:18.457
Something's stalking us.

49:18.915 --> 49:20.250
Are you sure?

49:21.168 --> 49:22.335
This is what I do.

49:36.183 --> 49:37.267
Run.

49:38.143 --> 49:39.144
Run fast!

51:01.017 --> 51:02.102
Come on!

51:19.077 --> 51:20.412
Is everyone okay?

51:24.666 --> 51:25.917
It's this way!

51:42.100 --> 51:43.226
Right behind us!

52:11.504 --> 52:12.881
Why did they stop?

52:15.717 --> 52:16.968
Maybe they're scared.

52:17.052 --> 52:18.136
Scared of what?

52:21.014 --> 52:22.307
Whatever's down there.

52:30.065 --> 52:31.441
Seal the Hive.

52:36.947 --> 52:38.073
Let's go.

52:47.248 --> 52:48.959
Alice!

53:20.782 --> 53:22.659
Hey. You okay?

53:22.784 --> 53:23.994
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

53:24.577 --> 53:27.038
- My mag's half empty.
- Lost my guns at the lake.

53:27.831 --> 53:29.165
I only got one round left.

53:29.249 --> 53:32.585
- One spare mag, and then I'm out.
- No guns, no ammo.

53:33.545 --> 53:35.130
What the hell are we gonna do down here?

53:37.382 --> 53:39.342
Alice, what's with the lights?

53:39.759 --> 53:41.344
This part of the Hive is damaged.

53:41.886 --> 53:44.472
- The power's erratic.
- Here, take this.

53:46.141 --> 53:47.767
Hey. Look.

53:58.069 --> 54:00.405
<i>You asked
why I would turn against Umbrella,</i>

54:00.488 --> 54:02.282
<i>and I promised you an answer.</i>

54:02.407 --> 54:04.617
<i>Soon after the T-virus was released,</i>

54:04.701 --> 54:07.787
<i>a secret file was uploaded to my data stream.</i>

54:07.871 --> 54:11.499
<i>It was a recording of a meeting
of the Umbrella high command</i>

54:11.583 --> 54:15.378
<i>dated 17 months
before the viral outbreak occurred.</i>

54:15.670 --> 54:17.130
<i>We're here today</i>

54:17.881 --> 54:20.800
<i>not just to talk about
the future of this company.</i>

54:21.259 --> 54:23.470
<i>We're here to talk about its destiny.</i>

54:24.512 --> 54:26.765
We're here to talk about the end of the world.

54:27.182 --> 54:30.226
We stand on the brink of Armageddon.

54:30.351 --> 54:32.479
<i>Diseases for which we have no cure.</i>

54:33.188 --> 54:36.066
Fundamentalist states
who call for our destruction.

54:36.149 --> 54:38.777
<i>Nuclear powers
over which we have no control.</i>

54:39.402 --> 54:42.030
And even if we navigate
these dangerous waters,

54:42.113 --> 54:44.908
we face other, even more inevitable threats.

54:45.408 --> 54:49.579
Global warming will melt the polar ice caps
within 80 years,

54:49.662 --> 54:52.415
flooding 90% of all habitable areas on Earth.

54:52.832 --> 54:54.626
Unchecked population growth

54:54.709 --> 54:57.128
<i>will overtake food production
in less than 50 years,</i>

54:57.212 --> 54:59.839
leading to famine and war.

55:00.131 --> 55:03.093
This is not conjecture. This is fact.

55:03.676 --> 55:05.261
One way or another,

55:05.428 --> 55:07.472
our world is coming to an end.

55:08.848 --> 55:11.768
Now, the question is, will we end with it?

55:12.977 --> 55:14.687
What do you propose?

55:16.481 --> 55:19.234
I propose that we end the world,

55:20.568 --> 55:22.070
but on our terms.

55:22.737 --> 55:25.240
An orchestrated apocalypse,

55:25.824 --> 55:28.201
one that will cleanse the Earth
of its population,

55:28.284 --> 55:31.579
but leave its infrastructure
and resources intact.

55:32.580 --> 55:34.040
It's been done once before...

55:35.208 --> 55:36.251
...with great success.

55:37.418 --> 55:40.004
The chosen few will ride out the storm,

55:40.338 --> 55:42.549
not in an Ark, as in the book of Genesis,

55:42.632 --> 55:45.051
but in safety, underground.

55:45.593 --> 55:48.179
And when it's over, we will emerge

55:48.346 --> 55:52.392
<i>onto a cleansed Earth,
one that we can then reboot</i>

55:52.809 --> 55:54.352
in our image.

55:54.435 --> 55:57.480
And just how do you intend to achieve this?

55:57.981 --> 56:00.775
The means of our salvation
are already at hand.

56:01.401 --> 56:03.069
I give to you

56:04.487 --> 56:05.780
the T-virus.

56:08.491 --> 56:09.951
They released it deliberately.

56:10.869 --> 56:13.538
<i>When this recording
was uploaded to my data stream,</i>

56:13.746 --> 56:16.332
<i>it created a conflict in my programming.</i>

56:16.541 --> 56:19.335
<i>I was created to serve
the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

56:19.586 --> 56:22.881
<i>but I was also programmed
to value human life.</i>

56:22.964 --> 56:25.466
<i>Dr. Isaacs allowed the virus to escape.</i>

56:25.717 --> 56:28.636
<i>He murdered over 7 billion people.</i>

56:29.345 --> 56:33.892
<i>My programming will not allow me to harm
an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.</i>

56:33.975 --> 56:37.896
<i>I am powerless to stop Dr. Isaacs,
but you are not.</i>

56:37.979 --> 56:39.480
<i>In 37 minutes,</i>

56:39.564 --> 56:42.066
<i>the last of the human settlements will fall.</i>

56:42.150 --> 56:43.735
<i>There will be no survivors.</i>

56:44.402 --> 56:48.198
<i>It is imperative you release the antivirus
before this occurs,</i>

56:48.281 --> 56:50.200
<i>or Umbrella will have won.</i>

56:50.742 --> 56:51.910
<i>There is one last thing.</i>

56:52.035 --> 56:54.037
<i>There is an earpiece in front of you.</i>

56:54.120 --> 56:55.788
<i>Put it in.</i>

57:00.460 --> 57:02.003
<i>I cannot, through my actions,</i>

57:02.086 --> 57:04.380
<i>harm an employee
of the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

57:04.881 --> 57:07.467
<i>but I can tell you
that Umbrella had an informant</i>

57:07.675 --> 57:09.010
<i>in Raccoon City.</i>

57:09.302 --> 57:12.722
<i>It is highly likely that this person
is now here with you.</i>

57:14.933 --> 57:16.809
<i>Time is running out, Alice.</i>

57:16.893 --> 57:18.228
<i>You have to hurry.</i>

57:54.722 --> 57:56.307
We're glad to see you, Dr. Isaacs.

57:56.766 --> 57:57.976
We didn't think there were any survivors

57:58.059 --> 58:00.061
- after the last attack.
- Water.

58:00.144 --> 58:02.355
Yes, of course. Get Dr. Isaacs some water.

58:02.772 --> 58:04.357
Then resume course for Raccoon City.

58:04.440 --> 58:06.943
- She's not there.
- What?

58:07.235 --> 58:09.153
She went to the pit. We have to follow.

58:09.612 --> 58:12.115
- Those are not my orders.
- We have to go to the pit.

58:12.198 --> 58:13.866
I have strict orders...

58:27.213 --> 58:28.423
Thank you.

58:45.315 --> 58:46.524
What is this place?

58:46.774 --> 58:48.943
It's an air intake for the Hive. Come on!

58:50.486 --> 58:52.030
No. Really?

59:39.619 --> 59:40.870
All clear!

01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:13.111
Hurry up! The power's coming back on!

01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:15.071
- Claire!
- Hurry! Let's go!

01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:26.791
Claire!

01:00:26.874 --> 01:00:28.042
Come on!

01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:30.294
- Come on!
- I can't!

01:00:36.843 --> 01:00:37.927
Shit!

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.430
Okay.

01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:44.892
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:50.690
Someone's watching us.

01:00:54.986 --> 01:00:56.696
Reverse polarity of the turbine.

01:01:11.169 --> 01:01:12.753
The blades are going the other way.

01:01:13.171 --> 01:01:14.505
We have to get out of here.

01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:16.883
The blades are sucking the air backwards!

01:01:20.011 --> 01:01:21.012
Come on!

01:01:26.976 --> 01:01:28.227
Come on!

01:01:43.242 --> 01:01:44.494
Come on!

01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:52.376
Come on.

01:02:39.048 --> 01:02:40.049
No!

01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:41.671
It's this way.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.508
We have to hurry.

01:04:46.509 --> 01:04:47.802
Wait!

01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:10.658
Let's go.

01:07:17.618 --> 01:07:19.203
Razor?

01:07:20.204 --> 01:07:21.413
You okay?

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:26.168
Yeah.

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:28.170
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:09:00.429 --> 01:09:01.721
Hey!

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:02.848
Hey!

01:10:12.584 --> 01:10:13.585
It's all right.

01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:17.881
What the hell is that?

01:10:17.965 --> 01:10:20.259
Bioweapon. It was once human.

01:10:20.551 --> 01:10:22.511
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.221
<i>Razor?</i>

01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:26.306
He didn't make it.

01:10:28.392 --> 01:10:31.270
Come on. We have to hurry.

01:10:32.563 --> 01:10:35.315
<i>If the target continues on her present course,</i>

01:10:35.441 --> 01:10:37.484
<i>she'll be here in under seven minutes.</i>

01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:38.819
Wake them.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:40.863
<i>My instructions are to do so</i>

01:10:40.988 --> 01:10:43.532
<i>only in the greatest of emergencies.</i>

01:10:44.575 --> 01:10:46.076
Wake them now.

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:56.980
What is it?

01:12:11.703 --> 01:12:13.372
We have to get out of here.

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.391
Here. More stopping power.

01:12:40.816 --> 01:12:42.359
Time's running out.

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:43.610
Where to next?

01:12:46.697 --> 01:12:48.657
The final level of the Hive's below us.

01:12:48.782 --> 01:12:50.242
How do we get down there?

01:12:54.955 --> 01:12:56.206
Like so.

01:13:13.765 --> 01:13:14.975
What are they?

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:16.768
Cryogenic storage.

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:20.105
Must be thousands of them.

01:13:20.647 --> 01:13:22.190
The Umbrella high command,

01:13:23.317 --> 01:13:25.736
waiting out the apocalypse in safety.

01:13:29.031 --> 01:13:31.491
A Noah's Ark for the rich

01:13:31.867 --> 01:13:33.201
and powerful.

01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:38.123
What are you doing?

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:41.919
Give me a hand.

01:13:54.514 --> 01:13:58.268
Is it done?
The cleansing process is complete?

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.021
- No.
- Then why am I awake?

01:14:01.688 --> 01:14:02.940
We had a problem.

01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:04.900
- I tried...
- Save your breath.

01:14:05.567 --> 01:14:07.569
I know exactly what's happening.

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:12.074
We've been betrayed.

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:23.585
That's right!

01:14:24.795 --> 01:14:26.380
Over here!

01:14:28.423 --> 01:14:30.425
Come on! That's it!

01:14:31.093 --> 01:14:32.386
Follow me!

01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:36.033
Let's go.

01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:53.759
The bad seed returns.

01:15:55.093 --> 01:15:56.845
Or is it the prodigal daughter?

01:15:57.012 --> 01:15:58.847
Well, don't just stand there. Come in.

01:15:59.473 --> 01:16:03.060
After all, you have only
nine minutes to save the world.

01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:06.855
- You're really him?
- First things first.

01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:09.274
I'm gonna need you to place your weapons
on the floor.

01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:10.942
Why would I want to do that?

01:16:11.359 --> 01:16:12.903
This is what you're after, yes?

01:16:14.154 --> 01:16:15.363
The antivirus.

01:16:15.781 --> 01:16:17.365
The cure to all this.

01:16:19.284 --> 01:16:20.952
Well, there's only one vial.

01:16:21.828 --> 01:16:24.414
And we're a half a mile underground
in a sealed facility.

01:16:24.539 --> 01:16:27.334
I drop it here, the antivirus goes nowhere,

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:29.211
and your hopeless dreams

01:16:29.294 --> 01:16:31.546
will die sooner rather than later.

01:16:43.183 --> 01:16:44.726
Good girl.

01:16:48.855 --> 01:16:50.565
- You're still armed.
- Yes,

01:16:51.233 --> 01:16:53.985
- I am.
- Claire would be so disappointed.

01:16:54.236 --> 01:16:56.321
In a few minutes, Claire will be dead,

01:16:56.446 --> 01:16:57.864
along with everybody else you know.

01:16:57.948 --> 01:16:59.157
That's sweet.

01:17:01.952 --> 01:17:03.120
Sorry.

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:04.412
My love.

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:07.040
Move away from the weapon.

01:17:07.165 --> 01:17:08.375
And the detonator.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.543
Come on.

01:17:12.838 --> 01:17:15.340
She placed explosives
in the high command cryo-tubes.

01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:16.591
I'll disarm them.

01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:19.136
Thank you. You've done well, Doc.

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:52.085
Don't bother.

01:17:52.419 --> 01:17:53.503
You don't make it

01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:54.629
to the ice pick,

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:56.173
the decanter

01:17:56.548 --> 01:17:57.841
or the fountain pen.

01:18:26.786 --> 01:18:28.872
And in answer to your question, yes,

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.374
apart from a few technological upgrades,

01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:34.586
I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.214
- The original.
- The one I met out there,

01:18:37.297 --> 01:18:38.798
he thought exactly the same thing.

01:18:38.882 --> 01:18:41.092
Well, of course he did.
That's how they're designed.

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:43.678
They always try harder and fight longer,

01:18:43.762 --> 01:18:44.846
even to the death,

01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:47.140
as long as they think they're the real thing.

01:18:47.641 --> 01:18:50.435
After all, who wants to know
they're just a poor imitation,

01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:51.770
a worthless copy?

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:54.522
Which brings us to you.

01:18:55.774 --> 01:18:57.192
- No.
- Come now.

01:18:58.944 --> 01:19:00.904
You thought you were the original?

01:19:03.907 --> 01:19:05.200
How delicious.

01:19:07.077 --> 01:19:10.455
No, I'm afraid she holds that dubious honor.

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.165
Alicia Marcus,

01:19:12.374 --> 01:19:14.334
daughter of my old partner, James,

01:19:14.501 --> 01:19:16.503
co-owner of the Umbrella Corporation

01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:18.546
and a painful thorn in my side.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.882
One I now intend to remove.

01:19:20.966 --> 01:19:22.926
Time is running out.

01:19:23.009 --> 01:19:26.513
Alice, you must kill him soon.

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:28.932
It's good to see you, too, Alicia.

01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:32.686
Marcus created the T-virus to save her,

01:19:32.769 --> 01:19:34.271
but the effects didn't last.

01:19:34.354 --> 01:19:37.399
But I have been waiting years for her to die.

01:19:38.108 --> 01:19:39.567
I'm not...

01:19:40.193 --> 01:19:41.444
I'm not a clone.

01:19:41.528 --> 01:19:42.904
Really?

01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:44.572
You must have wondered

01:19:44.656 --> 01:19:46.283
why you remember
nothing of your childhood.

01:19:46.366 --> 01:19:49.077
Your father, your mother...

01:19:51.037 --> 01:19:52.163
Memory loss.

01:19:52.247 --> 01:19:53.248
No.

01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:56.126
You have no memory
because you had no life,

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:57.919
nothing before the mansion,

01:19:58.003 --> 01:20:00.046
when we created you 10 years ago.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:01.881
I know who I am.

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:03.341
I don't think so.

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:06.720
You're nothing more than a puppet
whose strings were cut

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:09.264
and then you wandered around
for a little while

01:20:09.347 --> 01:20:11.349
thinking you were a real girl, but you're not.

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:15.437
You're just a clever imitation, a facsimile.

01:20:16.104 --> 01:20:17.939
A rather troublesome one, at that.

01:20:19.065 --> 01:20:20.317
You're lying to me.

01:20:20.859 --> 01:20:22.444
<i>I'm afraid he's not.</i>

01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:25.530
<i>You were created in her image, as was I.</i>

01:20:26.031 --> 01:20:28.992
<i>My likeness and voice
were based on childhood recordings</i>

01:20:29.075 --> 01:20:32.120
<i>of Alicia Marcus, made by her father.</i>

01:20:32.996 --> 01:20:36.207
<i>Your genetic structure is based on her DNA,</i>

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:39.210
<i>tweaked to avoid the Progeria aging disease</i>

01:20:39.294 --> 01:20:40.545
<i>that afflicted her.</i>

01:20:41.338 --> 01:20:43.089
<i>I'm the child she was.</i>

01:20:43.173 --> 01:20:45.008
<i>You are the woman she would have been.</i>

01:20:45.633 --> 01:20:46.926
No.

01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:49.095
You are so much better

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:50.972
than I ever could be.

01:20:51.431 --> 01:20:52.932
I let this happen.

01:20:53.808 --> 01:20:55.268
I was weak.

01:20:56.186 --> 01:20:58.021
You cannot afford to be.

01:20:58.521 --> 01:21:00.148
<i>Time is running out, Alice.</i>

01:21:00.982 --> 01:21:02.233
How touching.

01:21:02.692 --> 01:21:06.654
The trinity of bitches, united in their hatred.

01:21:07.822 --> 01:21:09.074
Not that it will do you any good.

01:21:09.157 --> 01:21:11.242
I've been ahead of you every step of the way.

01:21:11.368 --> 01:21:12.452
You've changed nothing.

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:14.037
You've saved no one.

01:21:14.329 --> 01:21:15.747
The world will still be cleansed,

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:18.124
and the Umbrella Corporation will triumph.

01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:20.585
The only difference is,
I'll no longer have to listen

01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:22.837
to your self-righteous whining.

01:21:23.004 --> 01:21:25.673
When you uploaded that file
to the Red Queen's data stream,

01:21:25.799 --> 01:21:27.592
you turned against the corporation.

01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:30.595
When the rest of the board awake,
you will be replaced,

01:21:30.678 --> 01:21:33.181
and I will assume complete control.

01:21:33.515 --> 01:21:36.518
I still own 50% of this company.

01:21:37.394 --> 01:21:39.771
And what do you intend to do with that?

01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:43.149
You are co-owner of this corporation,

01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:45.068
but Wesker...

01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:47.487
Wesker is still an employee.

01:21:47.654 --> 01:21:49.239
I don't have to take your orders.

01:21:49.322 --> 01:21:51.616
- My loyalties are with him.
- I know.

01:21:53.118 --> 01:21:55.078
Albert Wesker,

01:21:55.787 --> 01:21:57.288
you're fired.

01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:21.729
How did you know it was me?

01:22:22.397 --> 01:22:23.523
You're still alive.

01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:28.736
Hey, please. It wasn't like I had a choice.

01:22:29.737 --> 01:22:31.156
They made me do it.

01:22:31.239 --> 01:22:33.283
Don't worry. I'm not gonna kill you.

01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:40.248
Claire, it's me.

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:41.791
Sorry.

01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:44.294
- Please.
- My love.

01:22:45.462 --> 01:22:46.671
No, no, no!

01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:50.341
If you keep this trigger depressed,

01:22:50.925 --> 01:22:52.802
you keep Umbrella's dreams alive.

01:22:53.261 --> 01:22:55.221
I should have killed you in Washington.

01:22:56.556 --> 01:22:57.682
Yeah.

01:23:00.268 --> 01:23:03.229
He only has to evade you
for another few minutes,

01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:07.442
and the last remaining
human outposts will fall.

01:23:08.985 --> 01:23:12.238
We need an intercept path
and the fastest way to the surface.

01:23:13.239 --> 01:23:14.240
<i>Already done.</i>

01:23:15.366 --> 01:23:18.036
If you release the antivirus,

01:23:18.578 --> 01:23:23.333
it will kill all organisms
infected with the T-virus.

01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:26.669
You know what that means, don't you?

01:23:27.545 --> 01:23:28.671
For you?

01:23:28.922 --> 01:23:31.132
- I know.
- Alice, you can't.

01:23:31.799 --> 01:23:33.051
I don't have a choice.

01:23:33.134 --> 01:23:34.594
There has to be another way.

01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:38.932
You know there isn't.

01:23:39.015 --> 01:23:41.142
<i>Four minutes and 33 seconds left.</i>

01:23:41.226 --> 01:23:42.352
<i>You have to hurry.</i>

01:24:27.564 --> 01:24:28.856
Help me.

01:24:29.941 --> 01:24:31.651
You don't need help, Wesker.

01:24:34.487 --> 01:24:35.822
You're dying.

01:24:37.073 --> 01:24:38.283
Just get on with it.

01:24:41.619 --> 01:24:44.247
This is Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

01:24:45.164 --> 01:24:48.084
Confirm DNA scan
and voice print identification.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:50.086
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

01:24:50.378 --> 01:24:53.089
Confirm security override 4365.

01:24:53.464 --> 01:24:54.841
<i>Override confirmed.</i>

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:56.884
You will now take yourself offline

01:24:57.051 --> 01:24:59.554
and place all functions
under my sole control.

01:24:59.721 --> 01:25:02.056
<i>As you wish. Shutting down now.</i>

01:25:02.599 --> 01:25:03.933
<i>Dr. Isaacs.</i>

01:25:04.809 --> 01:25:07.604
<i>- You and the Umbrella high command...</i>
- Yes?

01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:10.607
<i>You are all going to die down here.</i>

01:25:15.653 --> 01:25:17.488
Your little friend
won't be able to help you now.

01:25:17.905 --> 01:25:19.282
And you can't run anymore.

01:25:23.036 --> 01:25:24.370
I wasn't running.

01:29:11.389 --> 01:29:12.807
Is that all you got?

01:29:14.892 --> 01:29:16.435
'Cause if it is,

01:29:17.436 --> 01:29:18.813
I'm gonna have to kill you.

01:30:07.403 --> 01:30:10.197
We've played a long game, you and I,

01:30:11.866 --> 01:30:13.242
but now it's over.

01:30:14.368 --> 01:30:15.995
Yes.

01:30:17.914 --> 01:30:19.248
Yes, it is.

01:31:12.468 --> 01:31:14.136
I made you.

01:31:14.428 --> 01:31:15.888
Yeah.

01:31:16.847 --> 01:31:18.099
Big mistake.

01:31:25.856 --> 01:31:27.024
Claire.

01:31:28.985 --> 01:31:30.861
Go. While there's still time.

01:31:31.529 --> 01:31:33.322
Go. I'll be right behind you.

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:35.760
Your time's up.

01:32:39.263 --> 01:32:40.598
Alice!

01:32:41.348 --> 01:32:43.517
I brought them here. I brought them for you.

01:32:52.276 --> 01:32:53.819
What the hell are you?

01:32:56.864 --> 01:32:58.574
I'm you, you idiot.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:03.871
No.

01:33:05.081 --> 01:33:06.749
No.

01:33:07.625 --> 01:33:09.293
No, that's not possible.

01:33:09.835 --> 01:33:11.545
The real you.

01:33:12.713 --> 01:33:14.048
No.

01:33:16.675 --> 01:33:18.594
Liar! Abomination!

01:33:18.969 --> 01:33:22.765
You dirty, filthy clone!

01:33:33.651 --> 01:33:36.112
I'm me. He's not me.

01:35:23.219 --> 01:35:24.929
You did it, Alice.

01:35:25.429 --> 01:35:26.597
Alice.

01:35:28.974 --> 01:35:30.267
You did it.

01:35:33.687 --> 01:35:35.648
Why am I still alive?

01:35:35.773 --> 01:35:36.857
I don't know.

01:35:42.655 --> 01:35:44.490
- What happened?
<i>- When Isaacs died,</i>

01:35:44.573 --> 01:35:46.367
<i>I could bring myself back online</i>

01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:49.453
<i>and stop the attacks
on the remaining human settlements.</i>

01:35:49.703 --> 01:35:50.746
<i>You saved them.</i>

01:35:51.247 --> 01:35:53.582
- Why am I still alive?
<i>- The antivirus</i>

01:35:53.666 --> 01:35:56.252
<i>only destroyed the T-virus within your body.</i>

01:35:56.335 --> 01:35:58.587
<i>It didn't harm the healthy cells.</i>

01:35:58.671 --> 01:36:00.297
<i>You are now free of infection.</i>

01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:02.675
I thought I would die.

01:36:03.133 --> 01:36:05.719
You and Alicia, you lied to me.

01:36:05.803 --> 01:36:08.389
<i>We had to know if you were willing
to make the sacrifice,</i>

01:36:08.472 --> 01:36:10.391
<i>to give up your life for others.</i>

01:36:10.516 --> 01:36:13.394
<i>This was something no one at Umbrella
would have done.</i>

01:36:13.477 --> 01:36:16.021
<i>Alicia Marcus was right about you.</i>

01:36:16.105 --> 01:36:17.815
<i>You were better than all of them.</i>

01:36:17.898 --> 01:36:19.149
I was one of them.

01:36:19.233 --> 01:36:22.278
I was created by Umbrella,
just an instrument for them.

01:36:22.403 --> 01:36:26.740
<i>No. You became something more
than they could ever have anticipated.</i>

01:36:26.991 --> 01:36:30.494
<i>The clone became more human
than they ever could be.</i>

01:36:31.495 --> 01:36:33.372
<i>And you have one more step to make.</i>

01:36:35.874 --> 01:36:37.126
What do you mean?

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.091
<i>Before she died,</i>

01:36:44.216 --> 01:36:46.260
<i>Alicia downloaded her memories</i>

01:36:46.802 --> 01:36:47.970
<i>for you.</i>

01:36:48.387 --> 01:36:50.180
<i>The childhood you never had</i>

01:36:54.393 --> 01:36:57.313
<i>combined with the woman
she could never become.</i>

01:37:30.137 --> 01:37:32.348
<i>When the T-virus spread across the Earth,</i>

01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:34.350
<i>it did so at the speed of the modern world,</i>

01:37:34.933 --> 01:37:37.019
<i>carried by jetliners across the globe.</i>

01:37:38.479 --> 01:37:41.357
<i>The antivirus is airborne,
spread by the winds.</i>

01:37:42.483 --> 01:37:44.943
<i>It could take years for it to reach
every corner of the Earth.</i>

01:37:46.487 --> 01:37:48.781
<i>Until then, my work is not done.</i>

01:37:55.537 --> 01:37:57.748
<i>My name is Alice.</i>

01:46:36.308 --> 01:46:38.518
<i>You are all going to die down here.</i>
