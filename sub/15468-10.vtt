Yo, Books...

00:20.479 --> 00:21.772
brought you a extra blanket.

00:32.406 --> 00:34.493
Look, Dizzee'll be all right, man.
He's tough.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.207
I'm gonna get down to the bottom
of everything. You got my word.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.668
My aunt was right.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.795
Leon was right.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.755
Mylene was right.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.217
I'm a drug dealer.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.760
What?

00:52.761 --> 00:55.514
When we perform,
is the music really the main event?

00:55.597 --> 00:56.598
It is to me.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.892
When I met you, Shao,

00:58.976 --> 01:00.185
it was because of music...

01:00.686 --> 01:01.645
because of a record.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.899
You turned us on to Flash
because of music,

01:05.983 --> 01:08.443
because music was all you had

01:08.527 --> 01:11.738
and you convinced us that it was all
we had too, so we followed you.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.157
And we followed Flash
and we honed our skills

01:14.241 --> 01:16.118
and we conquered the playgrounds,

01:16.201 --> 01:17.786
the rec centers and the barbecues.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.663
We got status because of music.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.084
And we did it for free.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.295
Girls kissed us for free.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.424
Gangsters respected us for free.

01:32.801 --> 01:33.677
And we were free...

01:35.387 --> 01:36.430
'cause the music...

01:37.222 --> 01:38.056
was free.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.976
We gotta get out of this contract,

01:41.435 --> 01:43.145
out of 10-51, out of this...

01:43.562 --> 01:45.063
this Fat Annie business.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.274
Even if it means no record.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.318
We gotta get out.

01:50.819 --> 01:51.695
So, what, Books?

01:53.155 --> 01:54.781
Wanna go back to the street corner?

01:56.199 --> 01:58.201
Hustle a gig a month at the rec center?

01:58.285 --> 02:01.288
I don't want my soul on loan
to evil motherfuckers

02:01.371 --> 02:03.582
like Fat Annie,
or Cadillac or Little Wolf.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.000
You don't get it.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.585
I got a family, man.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.755
You don't just get in with my family
and get out.

02:10.922 --> 02:11.840
I stand up to them...

02:12.341 --> 02:14.509
you don't got a fucking DJ no more, man!

02:14.593 --> 02:15.510
That ain't a family.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.679
Family's supposed to be about love.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.516
"Family's about love."

02:21.600 --> 02:23.935
I ain't never had no fucking family,
then, Books!

02:26.772 --> 02:27.648
You got me.

02:30.442 --> 02:33.612
Together, we gotta get out of
this drug thing, as fast as possible.

A thank you to Thor, I think.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.146
The white boy?

04:31.855 --> 04:32.689
Yeah.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.608
You scared us on that stage.

04:35.734 --> 04:36.943
Thought you might die.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.028
You dropped the mic...

04:39.321 --> 04:40.530
you walked towards him...

04:41.656 --> 04:43.408
like... like a zombie or something.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.994
You must be really good friends, huh?

04:48.955 --> 04:49.998
Got the new <i>Elfquest?</i>

04:50.582 --> 04:52.417
- No, I've been too busy.
- Well, I got it.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.503
You could borrow it if you want.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.924
Remember when I was little?

04:59.007 --> 05:01.593
You and your friends used to take me
to get comics?

05:01.676 --> 05:03.804
- Yeah.
- I used to know all your friends.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.181
Guess things change, right?

05:06.681 --> 05:09.267
Now you make enough money
on whatever you do on the side

05:09.351 --> 05:10.519
to buy your own comics...

05:11.603 --> 05:13.188
so things definitely do change.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.483
- Want me to leave you alone?
- Not at all.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.151
Take this marker.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.029
Let's see your styles.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.156
'Cause also...

05:23.615 --> 05:25.033
some things never do change.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.749
"Peace, love, unity."

05:32.999 --> 05:34.543
Hi, Tanya. This is Ronald.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.836
Who you gave the Zulu flyer to. Right.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.590
Your Chief Rocker, Ra-Ra Crocker,
single and free in the place to be.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.093
You got this, man. You got it. You got it.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.137
You see a dark side...

05:46.680 --> 05:48.181
you wait for the righteous path.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.391
Just be cool.

05:56.648 --> 05:57.566
Yeah, who this?

05:57.649 --> 06:00.694
- Hello, Ronald, this is Tanya. I mean...
<i>- You're Tanya?</i>

06:00.777 --> 06:02.737
<i>I mean, no. No, no. Let me do it over.</i>

06:02.821 --> 06:04.072
Hey, Tanya, this is Ronald.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.490
I mean, this is Ra-Ra.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.409
Ra-Ra, from the Get Down Brothers?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.536
<i>Who you gave the flyer to
for the Zulu party?</i>

06:09.619 --> 06:10.620
Oh, Ra-Ra.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.038
I'm here.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.791
- I'm listening. Proceed.
<i>- Um...</i>

06:14.874 --> 06:16.209
So, yeah. I... I was...

06:16.918 --> 06:20.338
I w... I was wondering if you wanted
to go out and talk about Bambaataa

06:20.422 --> 06:23.008
<i>and positivity and... And Bambaataa.
I mean, like,</i>

06:23.091 --> 06:25.010
if you wanted to go out and...

06:25.385 --> 06:27.304
<i>- Ra-Ra, are you sniffing glue?</i>
- Glue?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.222
No, no, no. You know what? Let me just...

06:29.306 --> 06:32.058
- Let me just call you back.
<i>- Wait, you asking me out or...?</i>

06:34.853 --> 06:36.229
Did he just hang up on me?

06:36.313 --> 06:37.981
What the fuck did I just do?

06:39.232 --> 06:42.485
Baby, you don't have a temperature,
not like your brother does.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.195
So, what's going on?

06:45.322 --> 06:47.616
Please don't be mad.
I was gonna tell you, really.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.743
Well, you can tell me anything.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.995
I'll listen with an open mind.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.373
Mr. Asheton wanted Mylene
and Regina and me

06:55.457 --> 06:59.044
to perform this new song tonight
at the Ruby Con.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.920
It's kind of like the new Studio 54.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.839
Like Studio 54?!

07:02.922 --> 07:03.965
- Kind of.
- Girl...

07:04.049 --> 07:04.924
More dirtier.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.387
And so Mylene made us promise
to keep this whole thing a secret

07:09.471 --> 07:13.350
'cause she couldn't tell her family,
so I promised her I wouldn't tell no one.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.977
But we rehearsed the song yesterday

07:16.561 --> 07:18.813
and it's inappropriate

07:18.980 --> 07:21.983
and I felt wrong lying to you about that,
so I bailed.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.986
<i>If you really
wanna know about the Zulus,</i>

07:25.070 --> 07:25.904
<i>you gotta sing to me.</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:27.322
I ain't doing that, Tanya.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.990
I rap, I don't sing.

07:29.741 --> 07:30.867
I can carry a tune.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.785
Good enough.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.955
- Proceed.
- If I carry a tune, you'll go out with me?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.831
Well, yeah.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.210
Ra-Ra, I need the phone.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.087
Mom, let me just do this one thing.

why they call you Strokeface?

08:52.782 --> 08:55.201
'Cause I look cool

08:55.285 --> 08:57.162

I'm making changes...

09:10.175 --> 09:11.509
starting with how Boo's doing.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.386
Little niglet got heart,

09:13.470 --> 09:14.596
but he fucked up, man.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.183
- If he ain't careful...
- Yeah, let me worry about that.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.936
Boo about to be 16, so if the pigs
get him, he can do a real stint.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.774
I don't want him under pressure,
speaking on our operation and shit.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.818
And I definitely don't want my brothers
knowing he was hustling.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.322
So I don't want him selling.
No hand-to-hand shit. From now on,

09:32.405 --> 09:34.115
Boo's done as the runner. He's out.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.492

- I'm not fucking asking you, man.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.290
Boo come around, turn him back. That's it.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.794

I can't do it. Something's come up.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.051
Could you wrap this plate in some tin foil
and I'll eat it when I come home?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.386
- Home from where?
- Ahh.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.139
Lydia,
I'm meeting with some television people.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.808
In addition to the radio show,
the National Pentecostal Board

11:23.892 --> 11:29.189
wants me to star in a weekly national
television broadcast.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.525
From our very own new church.
Isn't it incredible?

11:32.609 --> 11:36.404
Your Ramon is going to be
a very important person

11:36.487 --> 11:38.489
and a rising star for the church.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.533
- Is Mylene part of this deal?
- Mylene?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.076
Yes, of course. Mm.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.413
The family that stays together
gains together.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.249
- We're a team, aren't we?
- You need to call Rose,

11:48.333 --> 11:51.044
- explain why you won't be there.
- Señora Robles can lead the service.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.547
You don't have time to show up
at a church function that you organized,

11:54.631 --> 11:58.259
but you have time to go out and buy
a new suit like the one you're wearing.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.887
Okay, okay, what is going on?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.724
- Are you jealous of my success?
- Jealous?

12:05.183 --> 12:06.017
Ha!

12:06.100 --> 12:08.770
Are you trying to sabotage me?
Trying to diminish me

12:08.853 --> 12:11.356
- in the eyes of the church?
- The church?

12:12.815 --> 12:15.234
Ramon, the church only cares about you

12:15.318 --> 12:17.153
because Mylene is a star now.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.571
The church is using me
to get to my daughter?

12:18.655 --> 12:20.823
Wait. No, no, no. Don't answer that.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.700
Don't answer. We'll finish this now.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.453
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Lydia.</i>

12:25.828 --> 12:27.413
- Yes.
<i>- It's Adele Kipling calling.</i>

12:28.957 --> 12:30.625

- Good question.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.001
She got sick last minute.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.711

12:33.795 --> 12:34.754
Yeah, I know,

12:34.837 --> 12:36.798
and it's making me nervous
and it's like...

12:37.340 --> 12:39.300
- It's bad luck or something.
- No, no, no.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.551
<i>No te preocupes.</i>

12:40.635 --> 12:43.304
I told you already,
we're gonna be fired up on that stage,

12:43.888 --> 12:44.973

12:45.056 --> 12:46.683
<i>Pardon me for getting to the point.</i>

12:46.766 --> 12:49.060
I know if it were my daughter,
you'd do the same.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.229
<i>Yolanda confessed to me
that Mylene and Regina</i>

12:51.312 --> 12:53.690
<i>- are on their way downtown to...</i>
<i>- </i> Give me the phone.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.607
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Adele?

12:54.691 --> 12:56.776
<i>- Oh, Pastor Cruz.</i>
- Yes, this is Pastor Cruz.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.860
<i>Sorry to bother you...</i>

12:58.444 --> 13:00.905
but, uh...
Yolanda's just informed me that

13:00.989 --> 13:03.992
<i>the girls are performing at a club tonight
called Ruby Con.</i>

13:04.075 --> 13:07.412
No, no, no. Mylene is not appearing
at any club tonight.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.455
<i>Afraid your daughter is gravely mistaken.</i>

13:09.539 --> 13:10.957
<i>- Well, I hope you're right.</i>
- Ah.

Go away.

My club is for young and fabulous,

21:05.556 --> 21:06.390
It's her!

21:07.224 --> 21:08.893
Is that Misty Holloway?

21:09.143 --> 21:12.146
- Misty, Misty!
- Misty, I love you!

21:12.229 --> 21:14.899

- Misty, darling.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.652

- With Mr. Stigwood.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.362

21:55.648 --> 21:58.984

21:59.068 --> 22:02.154
Shane, I stole her song
and now I'm stealing her movie role, too.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.323

33:46.733 --> 33:47.734
Dizz, where you going?

33:49.069 --> 33:49.903
Don't worry, Boo.

33:51.696 --> 33:52.948
Yeah, but where you going?

33:53.532 --> 33:54.407
To see my friend.

33:56.618 --> 33:57.577
I'll come, too.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.288
No offense, Boo,

34:00.372 --> 34:04.084
but some things just ain't for you.
There's things you wouldn't understand.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.878
How many times I gotta tell you?
I'm not a kid anymore.

34:06.962 --> 34:10.382
I know, and maybe in an alternate
universe that would make a difference.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.386
Dizz, I'm sorry, man.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.264
I never meant for none of this
to happen to you.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.474
I was scared we were gonna lose you.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.391
For real.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.560
I know, Boo.

34:22.601 --> 34:23.436
I know.

34:23.812 --> 34:24.646
We cool.

34:25.605 --> 34:28.525
It's just the past couple days
has just really got me thinking.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.527
You know, life is short.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.404
And if you an alien...

34:33.780 --> 34:35.991
you gotta not apologize
for being an alien.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.493
You gotta join with the universe
and just be.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.665
Be careful on your surfboard.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.628
It's windy in the galaxy tonight.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.007
I love you, Boo.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.091
Love you too, Dizz.

35:35.967 --> 35:39.638
Shaolin Fantastic,
you know I could never say no to you.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.557
So, just ask Annie what you wanna ask me.

35:42.724 --> 35:43.558
Okay.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.561
You know like how in the Bible,
Moses finds Pharaoh...

35:47.771 --> 35:50.357
and he tells him, "Let my people go"?

35:50.440 --> 35:54.444
Oh, you're so sexy
when you're quoting Scriptures, boy.

35:54.527 --> 35:55.362
Thank you.

35:57.113 --> 36:00.575
But the fellas... they ain't comfortable
with making this record.

36:00.659 --> 36:04.996
Well, you a natural born boss.
It's your job to make them comfortable.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.040
- But, Annie...
- Ain't no buts, baby.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.751
You go and tell them
they signed a contract.

36:09.834 --> 36:13.463
That Annie already came out of pocket
for studio time,

36:13.546 --> 36:16.216
engineer, a motherfucking six-piece band.

36:17.092 --> 36:19.302
A band? What band?

36:20.178 --> 36:21.638
What you need a band for?

36:22.180 --> 36:24.849
We can't record the records.
You know that.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.935
Shit, you hipped me to that.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.812
No records like no DJ?

36:29.396 --> 36:32.982
- What am I supposed to do?
- Look, honey, listen. Listen to me.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.361
Your name will still be on the record.

36:37.404 --> 36:38.697
You're still gonna get paid.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.157
- Very handsomely.
- So, you're not gonna use me.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.035
You'd better soften your tone
when you speak to me.

36:44.119 --> 36:47.330
Annie, you're not gonna replace the DJ
for a fucking band.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.582
I'll beat you like I don't even know you.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.460
Stop it!

36:53.670 --> 36:56.673
You pull a fucking gun on me,
you'd better use it.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.221
- Yes!
- Mylene!

37:04.013 --> 37:06.391
- Mylene. It was great, girl.
- Okay, take your time.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.851
It's gonna be a long night.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.894
The first long night of many long nights,

37:09.978 --> 37:12.689
so I left a little something
on your dressing room table.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.066
- Only if you need it, all right?
- Okay.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.528
I'll be here when you're ready to
meet Roy. Stigwood was blown away.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.821
The movie is yours.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.491
- Mylene. Where's my girl?
- This is crazy.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.452
How could you? What possessed you?

37:26.244 --> 37:28.079
- Look what they've done to you.
- Help me!

37:28.163 --> 37:30.582
- No, no, no. I'm taking you out of here.
- Get off me.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.376
- No, I don't wanna... Get him out of here.
- I am her father!

37:33.460 --> 37:34.335
Go to hell.

37:34.878 --> 37:35.712
I'm done with you.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.422
I'm done. I'm done.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.884
I'm sorry. I'm gonna get dressed now.

37:41.301 --> 37:42.302

40:10.241 --> 40:11.242

40:30.178 --> 40:32.597
Silence. I don't want to speak to you.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.268
Lydia, get your coat.

40:38.019 --> 40:40.688

40:41.522 --> 40:42.732

42:57.700 --> 42:59.911

Something happened with her.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.538
She stole everything from me
since I was a fucking kid!

43:03.039 --> 43:05.500

43:08.252 --> 43:09.879

43:10.463 --> 43:12.757
She took everything
and wanted to take the music.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.793

43:51.087 --> 43:53.798

43:53.881 --> 43:56.259

you're sending home our last hope.

43:56.843 --> 43:59.679
If you're our last hope,
we're more fucked up than I thought.

43:59.762 --> 44:02.431
Not me.
Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation.

44:02.515 --> 44:04.934
Tonight I met with the queen.
She took me over there.

44:05.017 --> 44:06.352
It was the answer.

44:06.435 --> 44:08.437
Bambaataa's a music man,
Annie's a gangster.

44:08.521 --> 44:10.731
No, Bambaataa's a king.
Gangsters are scared of him.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.275
What are you talking about, Ra?

44:12.358 --> 44:16.154
He has an army of Zulu warriors.
They fucking up gangsters and dealers.

44:16.237 --> 44:17.780
Believe me, I seen it with my own eyes.

44:17.864 --> 44:21.409
And maybe if we show we're down
with peace and love and unity,

44:21.492 --> 44:24.203
maybe Bambaataa and the warriors
can defend us from Annie.

46:04.387 --> 46:05.596
My wife, Lydia...

46:06.472 --> 46:07.640
prostrated herself...

46:10.017 --> 46:11.519
to the will of the beast.

46:13.646 --> 46:14.480
And yet...

46:16.315 --> 46:17.149
given...

46:19.026 --> 46:20.611
to my brother her fruits.

46:22.071 --> 46:24.323
Which was not hers to give.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.158
Yet...

46:27.076 --> 46:29.537
I... rejoice!

46:31.455 --> 46:32.289
Hallelujah!

46:33.040 --> 46:34.041
My daughter!

46:35.501 --> 46:36.335
My...

46:38.546 --> 46:40.089
daughter, my songbird...

46:41.924 --> 46:43.968
dearest to my heart...

46:44.802 --> 46:48.180
was taken by Satan himself.

46:49.598 --> 46:51.392
<i>El diablo</i> laughs.

46:52.101 --> 46:54.228
Yet it is I who will save Mylene

46:54.687 --> 46:57.314
and I who shall save my brother Francisco,

46:57.648 --> 46:59.817
who helped the <i>barrios</i>
torch their own buildings

46:59.942 --> 47:01.694
to buy up their desolate wasteland.

47:02.111 --> 47:06.490
All so he could attain earthly power,
prestige and money.

47:06.782 --> 47:10.536
Instead of uplifting his people,
my brother has destroyed them...

47:11.287 --> 47:13.414
just as my wife destroyed me.

47:13.497 --> 47:17.084
And yet I stand before you, Jehovah,

47:17.293 --> 47:20.463
and I say forgive them
for they know not what they do.

47:20.546 --> 47:23.632
Forgive them,
who are not strong like me.

47:23.799 --> 47:26.635
And I know now, dear Lord,
that you made me strong

47:26.719 --> 47:29.972
that I may bear their burden
and pay their penance.

47:30.139 --> 47:31.432
Thanks be to God!

47:40.733 --> 47:43.861
Dag. This is the serious joint.

47:44.570 --> 47:49.700
Oh, it's a shame it's for religious shit,
because, like, I would sing here for real.

47:50.159 --> 47:54.163
I bet the acoustics is vicious.

47:54.246 --> 47:59.752
<i>♪ Hide your toys under the bed ♪</i>

48:00.002 --> 48:03.422
<i>♪ Time for this doll to get... ♪</i>

48:03.547 --> 48:04.465
Oh, hell, yeah.

48:05.466 --> 48:06.717
- What?
- Oh, my God!

48:07.009 --> 48:07.968
- Oh, shit!
<i>- Papi!</i>

48:09.220 --> 48:10.054
Mylene!

48:10.221 --> 48:11.055
<i>Papi?</i>

48:16.018 --> 48:17.103
Oh, my God.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.647
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

48:20.356 --> 48:21.190
Oh, my God, <i>Papi!</i>

48:21.941 --> 48:23.859
<i>Papi! </i>

48:23.943 --> 48:24.985
<i>Papi!</i>

48:29.323 --> 48:30.199
No.
