WEBVTT

00:50.092 --> 00:51.135
Shh!

01:25.002 --> 01:26.462
Mmm.

01:26.629 --> 01:29.423
Those hot dogs
are beginning to smell delicious.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.511
Speaking of dogs, where is that
original chowhound of ours?

01:33.678 --> 01:35.763
I've never seen him late for a meal.

01:36.055 --> 01:40.268
The Laurel and Hardy of the outdoors
are trying to put up Scooby's tent.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.312
Okay, pull.

01:43.479 --> 01:46.023
What the heck kind of tent
is this anyway, Scoob?

01:46.190 --> 01:47.942
- Pup tent.
- Pup tent?

01:48.109 --> 01:52.363
I might have known.
Well, let's try again.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.949
There.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.535
It looks real comfortable.

02:02.290 --> 02:06.335
- Now, what did you do that for?
- Come and get it, you guys.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.463
Chow time, pal. See you later.

02:10.756 --> 02:13.134
Food?

02:17.138 --> 02:18.472
Yum, yum, yum.

02:19.140 --> 02:22.351
There's nothing I like better
than food unless it's more food.

02:22.518 --> 02:23.644
Yeah, yeah.

02:27.690 --> 02:30.818
- What was that?
- Look.

02:39.952 --> 02:43.831
- What was that?
- Whatever it was, it's gone now. See?

02:45.333 --> 02:48.586
- It was probably only a wolf.
- What do you mean "only"?

02:48.753 --> 02:50.171
Let's take a look.

02:50.338 --> 02:53.132
Let's pretend we already did
and didn't find anything.

02:53.299 --> 02:57.011
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, Shaggy. Let's go look.

02:57.178 --> 03:02.058
Then this calls for some special
nerve-soothing nourishment.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.853
Scooby-Doo!

03:12.026 --> 03:14.779
- Tracks?
- Hey, it is tracks.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.282
- Good going, Scoob.
- Judging from the size...

03:18.449 --> 03:21.035
outline and general configuration...

03:21.285 --> 03:24.872
I would say they're definitely
the tracks of a large wolf.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.625
But he's gone, so we got nothing
to worry about.

03:27.792 --> 03:30.211
There's only one thing
that bothers me.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.214
- What's that?
- Wolves are four-legged animals...

03:33.381 --> 03:36.217
but these were made
by a two-legged one.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.219
A werewolf!

03:38.386 --> 03:40.471
A werewolf?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.892
Here we go with another mystery.

03:45.059 --> 03:48.562
And the only way to solve it
is to follow those tracks.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.982
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

03:53.943 --> 03:56.946
I smell trouble, scary trouble.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.282
- Look.
- It's an old graveyard.

04:00.449 --> 04:04.620
My very most unfavorite place to be,
especially at night.

04:04.787 --> 04:08.916
That's odd. A fresh grave
in an old graveyard like this.

04:09.083 --> 04:13.295
- Oh, no.
- Let's go see.

04:13.462 --> 04:17.049
Look. The coffin is open and empty.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.717
It sure looks old.

04:18.884 --> 04:23.472
"Here lies Silas Long,
half-man and half-wolf."

04:23.639 --> 04:27.726
And I'm half-gone already. Bye.

04:32.148 --> 04:35.943
Hey, come on, Shaggy.
This is our first really sound clue.

04:36.110 --> 04:39.655
Yeah, but it looks like
our Clue is out to dinner.

04:39.822 --> 04:43.325
And look, there are more wolf tracks
leading away from the grave.

04:43.492 --> 04:48.289
It ain't bad enough we're following
a werewolf. It's the ghost of a werewolf.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.291
Ghost?

04:56.172 --> 05:00.676
Well, the tracks clearly
lead into that old mill.

05:07.016 --> 05:11.145
Nothing like a cheery greeting from your
friendly neighborhood werewolf ghost.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.981
Come on, let's take a look inside.

05:19.904 --> 05:22.031
Hey, it's opening.

05:23.324 --> 05:26.368
What a scary place.

05:26.619 --> 05:28.454
Furnished in early werewolf.

05:28.621 --> 05:33.501
Don't look like the cleaning woman's
been by too recently either.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.712
We'll split up.
I'll take the girls this way.

05:36.879 --> 05:40.716
Yeah, I know. And Scooby
and me will go the other way.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.471
Ouch!

05:46.889 --> 05:49.058
- What's so funny?
- Yipe!

05:49.808 --> 05:52.228
It's him, the ghosty werewolf!

05:52.394 --> 05:55.606
- Gone.
- Where did he go so fast?

06:01.904 --> 06:04.865
Imagine you getting so scared
of a tiny little old mouse.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.077
- Ridiculous.
- Yeah. Ridiculous.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.960
Anything in that old crate?

06:16.168 --> 06:17.419
No.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.297
Maybe there's nothing
to be scared of in this place.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.550
Yeah.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.807
Wonder what's in here.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.312
- Nothing here.
- Nothing here.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.695
Sure be a joke
if this werewolf thing...

06:42.861 --> 06:46.490
turned out to be
our imagination after all.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.369
- What's that?
- What's that?

06:50.536 --> 06:53.163
Oh, just some kind of old mask.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.752
- What was that?
- Search me.

07:03.716 --> 07:07.553
We haven't found a thing. Maybe
we're on a wild-goose Chase after all.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.598
- Could be.
- Hold it. Look at that.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.641
Tracks.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.270
That's funny.
The tracks stop at the wall.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.607
But even a werewolf
can't walk through a wall.

07:19.773 --> 07:24.612
- Unless he really is a ghost.
- I'II bet there's a secret entrance.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.281
Let's see if we can find out
how to open it.

07:27.698 --> 07:31.243
- Uh-oh. Pay dirt.
- Good going, Freddy.

07:31.410 --> 07:35.164
- We found a secret room.
- Come on.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.710
- What's that paper on the table?
- Looks like a map.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.920
Do you suppose it's a treasure map?

07:42.087 --> 07:43.297
Not likely.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.133
It looks more like a map
of the general area around here.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.260
There's three X's marked on it.

07:49.887 --> 07:53.390
- One says, â€œMill."
- At least ghosts don't need maps, so-

07:54.808 --> 07:57.519
It's the werewolf!

08:00.564 --> 08:02.358
Hold it!

08:03.067 --> 08:05.319
Get ready.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.989
Okay, shove!

08:19.083 --> 08:21.585
Hi, gang. You'll be glad to know
Scoob and me...

08:21.752 --> 08:23.837
haven't found a trace of a ghost.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.173
- The werewolf!
- Yikes!

08:31.345 --> 08:35.557
Feet, make like a rocket,
and, like, now!

10:41.767 --> 10:45.521
What happened to Shag and Scoob
after they fell on that water wheel?

10:45.771 --> 10:50.275
I hope that terrible werewolf creature
didn't get them.

10:51.777 --> 10:55.197
Oh, no! More ghosts!

10:55.781 --> 10:59.535
- Why did they run away?
- I know. Watch.

11:03.121 --> 11:06.708
Oh, they thought we were ghosts.

11:08.210 --> 11:11.922
- Thanks. Let's go find where they went.
- Right.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.722
- What's that?
- Beats me.

11:21.473 --> 11:25.310
Never saw a barrel
with anything like this on it before.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.482
Uh-oh. Let us go.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.901
Hold it, you two. It's me.

11:33.402 --> 11:37.197
- What are you doing in there?
- Waiting for the werewolf to come.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.950
- What else?
- Well, I'm glad we found you.

11:40.117 --> 11:43.120
What's that in your ears?

11:43.579 --> 11:47.833
Oh, wool, I guess. Me and Scooby
crash-landed in a pile of wool.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.420
- So that was you in the white stuff.
- This is curious.

11:51.587 --> 11:54.256
What would wool be doing
in an old abandoned mill?

11:54.423 --> 11:57.009
We've got a lot of strange clues
that don't fit...

11:57.175 --> 12:00.762
the wool, these funny barrels
with rubber tubing, the map...

12:00.929 --> 12:03.515
- And that ghostly werewolf.
- Yeah.

12:03.682 --> 12:07.352
I'd sure like to know how
Mr. Creepy-Crawly fits in with all this.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.771
- Me too.
- Let's go find him.

12:10.022 --> 12:14.234
- Oh, why don't I just keep quiet?
- Yeah.

12:15.861 --> 12:20.198
It's been entirely too long since
we've seen our friend the werewolf.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.326
He's probably up to something.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.787
I knew it was too good to last.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.796
Come on, girls. Let's go see
where that railcar came from.

12:35.172 --> 12:38.634
Don't tell me. Scoob and me
go to see where it's going, right?

12:38.800 --> 12:41.470
You got it. And be careful.

12:41.637 --> 12:47.059
Now, that's probably the most
unnecessary thing she'll ever say.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.232
Look, there's that narrow-gauge rail.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.903
Let's see where it leads to. This way.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.658
Look!

13:08.246 --> 13:11.166
- Who's that?
- And what's he up to?

13:11.333 --> 13:14.002
I don't know, but let's find out.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.587
He's gone!

13:15.754 --> 13:18.423
But where?
There's no other doors in this place.

13:22.260 --> 13:25.013
- We're locked in!
- Let's try that window.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.434
- Oh, we're trapped.
- But good.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.162
- How about that? A pop-top barge.
- Yeah.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.086
Ah!

14:05.512 --> 14:07.723
What do we do now?

14:28.660 --> 14:30.871
Step right in, sir.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.622
No waiting.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.292
I know, just a light trim, sir.

14:35.459 --> 14:38.128
We're all wearing it
a bit longer these days.

14:38.962 --> 14:42.007
Bad nails.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.801
You have a dandruff problem too, sir.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.977
Something wrong, sir?

14:54.144 --> 14:56.855
Scooby, scat!

15:15.499 --> 15:19.211
Well, do we follow this tunnel
or go back up there and face him?

15:19.377 --> 15:20.962
Uh-uh.

15:22.881 --> 15:26.093
No telling where this will lead us.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.138
Sure would like to know
what this thing is.

15:30.305 --> 15:32.474
I'd rather know
how we're gonna get out of here.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.478
Listen. What's that?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.481
Look.

15:40.649 --> 15:44.027
Well, well, Dr. Livingston
and friends, I presume.

15:45.112 --> 15:49.866
But how could these railcars just
simply disappear into that old barge?

15:50.200 --> 15:54.579
Yeah, and what do you mean the
deckhouse tips up, and they go inside?

15:54.746 --> 15:57.791
- But they do.
- You're talking in riddles.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.545
Hold it. Hold it. It'll be easier
to show you than to tell you.

16:02.087 --> 16:05.549
- You mean-?
- We gotta go back through the tunnel.

16:05.715 --> 16:09.427
You know how Freddy and Velma are
when they got a mystery to unsolve.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.347
Oh, no.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.607
Now, watch.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.360
Run!

16:27.571 --> 16:29.656
At least we know where the barrels are.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.784
If we only knew why.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.036
Look, it's him.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.082
What in the world?

16:39.249 --> 16:42.085
He's pulling a barrel
out of the water.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.258
- I hear sheep.
- Me too.

16:51.761 --> 16:55.682
You certainly do. And I think
I'm beginning to get the picture.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.559
- Right, Freddy?
- Right.

16:57.726 --> 17:00.437
But we'll have to capture
that werewolf to prove it.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.939
- Do what?
- Capture him?

17:03.106 --> 17:05.775
I've got a plan.
Now, listen closely.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.990
I don't know why I let you and
Freddy talk me into this crazy idea.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.909
- Me?
- Nutty notion...

17:14.075 --> 17:18.830
us distracting that werewolf's
attention so's they can capture him.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.375
Shall we cast off, skipper?

17:22.542 --> 17:25.712
Anchors aweigh.

17:31.343 --> 17:34.930
At least we know what
this tube is for now. It's for air.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.308
Let's make sure we all understand.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.602
When Shag and Scoob distract
the werewolf...

17:40.769 --> 17:42.687
we snag him with this crane
and hook.

17:42.938 --> 17:46.358
Then it's up, up and away
for the old werewolf, and we got him.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.110
Here comes Shag and Scoob's
barrel now.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.072
That's them.
You gals get up on the deckhouse...

17:52.239 --> 17:54.157
- and give me directions.
- Right.

17:59.454 --> 18:04.084
- Okay, get ready.
- Surprise!

18:06.002 --> 18:10.173
- Freddy, let the hook go.
- Stand clear.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.468
- Help! Help!
- Freddy, come quick!

18:16.012 --> 18:18.223
Grab her!

18:24.312 --> 18:27.190
Scoob, let's take
the scenic river route out of here.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.986
I am. I am.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.154
Hold still. We'll get you unhooked.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.913
I'd trade most anything
for a good, fast motor right now.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.041
- Except me?
- Right. Anything except you, pal.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.502
Keep paddling.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.799
Hey, no hitchhikers.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.512
Sorry, chum, but we got
enough trouble without you.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.973
Go bother someone else.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.894
Uh-oh. Look.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.114
He's gaining, Scoob.
Pour on the steam.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.991
I am. I am.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.577
We've gotta help them
before it's too late.

19:20.744 --> 19:24.831
- But what can we do?
- I've got an idea. Come on. Hurry!

19:28.418 --> 19:30.503
What's the matter?

19:30.754 --> 19:33.757
Yipes! Let's play
a little water hopscotch.

19:33.923 --> 19:37.469
- Give a big jump.
- Okay.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.555
Ah!

19:42.557 --> 19:46.186
- Oh, no!
- Yipes! And double yipes!

19:48.772 --> 19:51.524
Help!

19:54.694 --> 19:57.489
Look what we caught,
and without any bait.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.450
Never thought I'd be glad
to be a fish.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.203
Me too.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.873
- Help!
- Who could that be?

20:07.040 --> 20:10.001
Help! Help!

20:10.168 --> 20:11.711
It's the werewolf.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.548
Help! Save me!

20:15.715 --> 20:18.968
He sure doesn't sound
much like a werewolf anymore.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.970
Well, let's fish him out too.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.934
We sure thank you kids for unraveling
this smuggling mystery for us.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.769
AW-

20:28.853 --> 20:30.814
We didn't know how
the sheep rustlers...

20:30.980 --> 20:33.358
got them across the river
without being seen.

20:33.608 --> 20:35.610
Floating them downstream in barrels...

20:35.777 --> 20:38.696
with the air hoses was
pretty ingenious.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.032
First they'd shear them here
in the mill...

20:41.199 --> 20:43.618
then ship them
to the black market somewhere.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.036
That's about it.

20:45.203 --> 20:49.707
The werewolf disguises and open grave
were just to scare off intruders.

20:49.874 --> 20:53.253
Shucks, he didn't scare
Scoob and me for a minute.

20:56.047 --> 20:59.551
What's that? Oh, my gosh.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.100
Scooby-Doo!

21:56.691 --> 21:57.734
Shh!
