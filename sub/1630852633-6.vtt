Previously on Billions.

00:05.939 --> 00:06.000
We‘re flipping the paradigm.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.541
We‘re flipping the paradigm.

00:07.574 --> 00:09.243
Our investors will have
to prove their worth.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.145
As a company.
As human beings.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.000
You talk a big game,

00:12.000 --> 00:12.212
You talk a big game,

00:12.245 --> 00:14.014
but every move you make

00:14.047 --> 00:15.749
comes from
a personal pain so deep,

00:15.782 --> 00:17.551
you can‘t even recognize it.

00:17.584 --> 00:18.000
Stay out of the apartment
until I clear my shit out.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.754
Stay out of the apartment

legal officers of this state

00:23.757 --> 00:24.000

What‘s on your mind?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.627
pop up on my calendar.
What‘s on your mind?

00:26.660 --> 00:28.395
Welcome to Michael Prince
Capital, Kate.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.430
Where do I work?

00:29.463 --> 00:30.000
Wherever you want.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.898
Wherever you want.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.366
I see beyond the woman
who stood up for

00:32.399 --> 00:35.069
an indefensible seafood scam

00:35.102 --> 00:36.000
to the better person
lurking beneath.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.137
to the better person
lurking beneath.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.772
So you came here
to yell at me?

00:38.805 --> 00:41.141
I came here....
to hire you.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.000
Trying to impress you.

00:42.000 --> 00:42.543
Trying to impress you.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.278
Hire you.
How am I doing?

00:44.311 --> 00:45.913
I sometimes think about
what I could do at a place

00:45.946 --> 00:47.548
built for speed and power.

00:47.581 --> 00:48.000
I‘d like to get
Philip Charyn out of here.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.583
I‘d like to get
Philip Charyn out of here.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.318
You kept your nephew out of
the Prince Companies for years.

00:51.351 --> 00:53.087
I win this round.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.000
Philip, I‘m doubling the book
you had at your old place.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.322
Philip, I‘m doubling the book
you had at your old place.

00:55.355 --> 00:57.624
-Thanks, Mike.
-Tuk, I‘m zeroing you out.

00:57.657 --> 00:59.193
You‘ll service Philip for now.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.000
And I‘m here to get
what I‘m worth.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.226
And I‘m here to get
what I‘m worth.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.564
Get a load of that.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.000
The real version will be up
at the opening ceremony in ‘28.

01:06.000 --> 01:06.033
The real version will be up
at the opening ceremony in ‘28.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.267
Well, uh....

01:07.300 --> 01:09.369
Both of us serve the people,

01:09.402 --> 01:12.000
and Mike Prince‘s grand plan,
it doesn‘t really serve them.

01:12.000 --> 01:12.072
and Mike Prince‘s grand plan,
it doesn‘t really serve them.

01:12.105 --> 01:14.741
I may need
a little more convincing.

underground transportation.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.000
Door closure to departure time,
cut in half.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.706
Door closure to departure time,
cut in half.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.841
Requires only one driver.

01:47.874 --> 01:48.000
Silent braking mechanics

[Plimpton] Who even

02:27.314 --> 02:29.516
get away with buying himself
a subway system?

I‘m that working man.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.556
The men of my union
are those working men.

Boy, you don‘t leave much
unsaid, do ya, Ton‘?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.562
I will as soon as you
tell me

02:41.595 --> 02:42.000
how you can sit there and let

-[Dave] He isn‘t.
-Dave, meet Tony Plimpton.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.000
He runs the
Transport Workers Union,

02:48.000 --> 02:48.368
He runs the
Transport Workers Union,

02:48.401 --> 02:50.604
and he never visits me
when he‘s happy

02:50.637 --> 02:53.006
with my performance.
Now why is that?

02:53.039 --> 02:54.000
You know,
my dad always said,

02:54.000 --> 02:54.374
You know,
my dad always said,

02:54.407 --> 02:55.943
"People forget
the pat on the back

02:55.976 --> 02:57.444
but they remember
the kick in the ass."

02:57.477 --> 02:59.046
You should make
that the union motto.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.000
I would, ‘cept our motto is,

No shots to the solar plexus.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.928
Now, specifics, please.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.863
My guys in the rail yard caught
a glimpse of this new OPTO

Subway car.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.703
Fancy motherfucking beast,
and this guy Michael Prince

03:22.736 --> 03:24.000
wants to gift a thousand
of them to the city.

03:24.000 --> 03:24.705
wants to gift a thousand

03:24.738 --> 03:27.074
Oh, boy, no limit to
the benevolence of a man

03:27.107 --> 03:29.076
who wants the Olympics
to come to New York.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, well Mr. Benevolence
is gonna destroy my union.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.346
Yeah, well Mr. Benevolence

03:32.379 --> 03:33.914
Each car has one less driver.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.382
That‘s a thousand

03:35.415 --> 03:36.000
The next generation
won‘t use any.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.718
The next generation
won‘t use any.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.152
That‘s a death knell.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.454
And today‘s not
a good day to die,

03:40.487 --> 03:42.000
and tomorrow would suck, too.

03:42.000 --> 03:42.322
and tomorrow would suck, too.

03:42.355 --> 03:45.124
So, we need you to do for us
what you did for the doormen.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.000
We...

03:48.000 --> 03:48.829
We...

03:48.862 --> 03:50.831
my new Deputy Dawg,
Dave Mahar, and I

03:50.864 --> 03:52.099
can block this purchase

03:52.132 --> 03:53.567
and save the fine men and women

03:53.600 --> 03:54.000
of the TWU.
And we will.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.868

And we will.

03:59.372 --> 04:00.000
Yeah? Yeah, that‘s it?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.108
Yeah? Yeah, that‘s it?

04:01.141 --> 04:03.043
You sound disappointed.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.045
Well, you know,
I like the yelling part.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.000
-But, okay.
-I‘m sure you‘ll find a way

04:06.000 --> 04:06.847
-But, okay.
-I‘m sure you‘ll find a way

04:06.880 --> 04:09.449
to hector me again.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.885
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

04:11.918 --> 04:12.000
Thanks.

04:12.000 --> 04:12.953
Thanks.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.254
[Chuck exhales]

04:16.323 --> 04:18.000
You disapprove,
yet took my side. I like that.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.792
You disapprove,
yet took my side. I like that.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.727
That‘s what
a Deputy Dawg does.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.329
But, now that we‘re alone,

04:22.362 --> 04:24.000
convince me how a thousand
pristine subway cars

04:24.000 --> 04:24.965
convince me how a thousand
pristine subway cars

04:24.998 --> 04:27.000
aren‘t a net positive
for the city

04:27.033 --> 04:29.002
compared to the shitbox
I just rode to work.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.000
Not to mention the Olympics.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.470
Not to mention the Olympics.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.606
And why Mike Prince
is in your sights?

04:32.639 --> 04:34.474
Because he is a robber baron,

04:34.507 --> 04:36.000
and what he is engaging in
is just the latest form

04:36.000 --> 04:37.344
and what he is engaging in
is just the latest form

04:37.377 --> 04:39.646
of noblesse oblige.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.915
Trying to help people
to further his own ends,

04:41.948 --> 04:42.000
whatever they may be,
while he enjoys ten thousand--

04:42.000 --> 04:45.519
whatever they may be,
while he enjoys ten thousand--

04:45.552 --> 04:48.000
a hundred thousand times
the resources any of them do.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.356
a hundred thousand times
the resources any of them do.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.191
It‘s like Branson in space.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.000
You‘re familiar with
the original term for pirate,

04:54.000 --> 04:54.328
You‘re familiar with
the original term for pirate,

04:54.361 --> 04:55.962
"Hostis humani generis."

04:55.995 --> 04:57.230
"Enemy of all mankind."

04:57.263 --> 04:58.632
That‘s right.

04:58.665 --> 04:59.966
Beyond any legal protection

04:59.999 --> 05:00.000
and prosecutable
by any and all.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.902
and prosecutable
by any and all.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.271
It‘s what I‘ve come
to know Mike Prince is,

05:04.304 --> 05:06.000
and those like him.

05:06.000 --> 05:06.073
and those like him.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.475
You will too, no doubt.

05:08.508 --> 05:12.000
So let‘s find a way
to take his toy trains away.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.312
So let‘s find a way

05:12.345 --> 05:14.280
Start with your predecessor.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.821
[Prince]
Is Chuck trying to rattle you?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.289
Maybe.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.890
Or them looking for intel.

05:23.923 --> 05:24.000
Go, and try to get
and not give.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.693
Go, and try to get

05:28.194 --> 05:29.529
Watch your six.

05:29.562 --> 05:30.000
[Sacker] Always.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.331
[Sacker] Always.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.917
Nice spot for a meet.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.552
Right across from the most
dangerous crossroads

05:52.585 --> 05:54.000
in all of New York
for a hundred years.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.388
in all of New York
for a hundred years.

05:54.421 --> 05:55.789
Mulberry Bend, sure.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.791
Dead Rabbits,
the Roach Guards, the Whyos,

05:57.824 --> 06:00.000
the Five Pointers,
all the Gambinos,

06:00.000 --> 06:00.260
the Five Pointers,
all the Gambinos,

06:00.293 --> 06:03.397
all of them used that corner
to meet and hatch crimes.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.065
You sending me a message,

06:05.098 --> 06:06.000
or does Chuck already
have you planning murders?

06:06.000 --> 06:06.366
or does Chuck already
have you planning murders?

06:06.399 --> 06:08.368
No. Not yet.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.036
Did you plan any for him?

06:10.069 --> 06:12.000
-[chuckles]
-I‘m actually visiting my mom.

06:12.000 --> 06:12.472
-[chuckles]
-I‘m actually visiting my mom.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.174
She still lives
in a third-story walk-up

06:14.207 --> 06:16.676
above that restaurant
over there, where I grew up.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.000
Won‘t let me
move her to Florida.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.678
Won‘t let me
move her to Florida.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.313
Anyway, thanks for meeting.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.349
I always try and connect
with my predecessor,

06:22.382 --> 06:24.000
see where the IEDs are buried
too close to the surface.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.452
see where the IEDs are buried
too close to the surface.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.288
Also for help understanding
the legal arguments

06:28.321 --> 06:30.000
your predecessor
was planning to make?

06:30.000 --> 06:30.090
your predecessor
was planning to make?

06:30.123 --> 06:32.025
Unfinished cases, yes.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.927
If you can tell me
your intention on these,

06:33.960 --> 06:35.262
how you visualized the win,

06:35.295 --> 06:36.000
then maybe I can
clumsily finish the job.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.031
then maybe I can
clumsily finish the job.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.033
I wrote questions
in the margins.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.568
You‘d still be the one
getting the win.

06:41.601 --> 06:42.000
I‘m just the relief pitcher
on these.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.103
I‘m just the relief pitcher
on these.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.738
And you‘re gonna get the save?

06:44.771 --> 06:46.573
Are you saving me?

06:46.606 --> 06:48.000
Seems you‘ve already
saved yourself, haven‘t you?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.342
Seems you‘ve already
saved yourself, haven‘t you?

06:52.479 --> 06:54.000
Oh... [laughs]

06:54.000 --> 06:54.281
Oh... [laughs]

06:54.314 --> 06:56.149
Sure. I‘ll look.

06:56.182 --> 06:57.918
That‘s it?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.953
Well, I wish I had
the time for more history

06:59.986 --> 07:00.000
of the Lower East Side,
but the pace where I‘m at,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.389
of the Lower East Side,
but the pace where I‘m at,

07:02.422 --> 07:03.690
you know, you‘ve been
in the private sector.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.625
-Yes.
-Guess I never really

07:05.658 --> 07:06.000
appreciated how time-consuming
the everyday bureaucracy was

07:06.000 --> 07:07.694
appreciated how time-consuming
the everyday bureaucracy was

07:07.727 --> 07:09.429
until I left government work.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.131
Where I‘m at now,
things need to happen

07:11.164 --> 07:12.000
at the speed of light,
which suits me.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.866
at the speed of light,
which suits me.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.401
I will have these
couriered back to you soonest.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.069
I appreciate the kindness.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.000
It‘s not kindness.
I want those wins!

07:18.000 --> 07:19.172
It‘s not kindness.
I want those wins!

07:24.244 --> 07:26.713
Advisory Board sent word
that they‘re excited about

07:26.746 --> 07:28.748
the branding utility
of the games.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.000
But with expenditures
against current capital

07:30.000 --> 07:30.584
But with expenditures
against current capital

07:30.617 --> 07:33.854
-under management, that...
-That if you‘re serious

07:33.887 --> 07:35.489
about this Bobby Bacala
choo-choo train shit,

07:35.522 --> 07:36.000
you‘re going to need
more cash coming in.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.023
you‘re going to need
more cash coming in.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.425
How much more?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.360
Backstroking
Scrooge McDuck levels.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.000
Scarcity has served us well.

07:42.000 --> 07:42.429
Scarcity has served us well.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.097
The Prince List
is hard to get on.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.665
I don‘t think
we should change that.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.000
There‘s no point
in playing Steve Rubell

07:47.033 --> 07:48.000
if you let everyone in the club.

07:48.000 --> 07:48.502
if you let everyone in the club.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.170
Their point is,
they‘re afraid the scarcity

07:50.203 --> 07:52.238
that the Prince List created
is going to kill it.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.112
-The point is--
-Shh.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.000
He‘s doing a 360
and looking at the whole world.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.947
He‘s doing a 360
and looking at the whole world.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.482
Let it happen.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.000
Yep. Yes.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.820
Yep. Yes.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.455
I‘ll consider new investors.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.290
But it‘s not open season,

08:10.323 --> 08:12.000
and I‘m not letting anyone in
because I need to.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.659
and I‘m not letting anyone in
because I need to.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.294
Want. Not need.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.096
Zero dog and pony.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.931
Just let people know
we‘re open to their calls.

08:17.964 --> 08:18.000
One step closer to delivering
a privately funded

08:18.000 --> 08:20.467
One step closer to delivering
a privately funded

08:20.500 --> 08:22.468
Olympics to New York.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.676
How was your meeting
with Ms. Mahar?

08:29.709 --> 08:30.000
It was a fishing expedition.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.378
It was a fishing expedition.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.947
She got nothing. She‘s
good enough that I got nothing

08:33.980 --> 08:35.549
except the cute origin story

08:35.582 --> 08:36.000
and some quotidian notes
on cases I left behind.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.517
and some quotidian notes
on cases I left behind.

08:37.550 --> 08:40.420
No real sense of the ways
that Chuck might come after us.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.000
She‘s certain of herself;

08:42.000 --> 08:42.489
She‘s certain of herself;

08:42.522 --> 08:45.892
certain that she‘s read you
even when you know she hasn‘t.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.894
So we just need to be
ready for anything.

08:47.927 --> 08:48.000
Those are my standing
orders since birth.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.564
Those are my standing
orders since birth.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.566
That feeling of frustration,

08:52.599 --> 08:54.000
that sense you can‘t tell where
they‘re going to attack from,

08:54.000 --> 08:54.034
that sense you can‘t tell where
they‘re going to attack from,

08:54.067 --> 08:55.869
it‘s a good feeling.
Helpful.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.604
So stay there if you can.

08:57.637 --> 08:58.905
Then we‘ll both be ready.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.232
Dave. I just need another
day with the files.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.534
I will messenger them back
first thing in the morning.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.000
[Winston]
Can I have my phone back?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.877
[Winston]
Can I have my phone back?

09:37.910 --> 09:40.213
I need you to be patient.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.000
Let‘s say you did
something that people on Twitter

09:42.000 --> 09:42.749
Let‘s say you did
something that people on Twitter

09:42.782 --> 09:44.384
or wherever didn‘t like.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.953
And you get ratioed,
like he did.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.000
With Winch, I can get rid
of all the bad comments,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.123
With Winch, I can get rid
of all the bad comments,

09:50.156 --> 09:52.926
the original posts, the copies
made of it, everything.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.000
The program‘s impressive.
And they need an influx of cash?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.996
The program‘s impressive.
And they need an influx of cash?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.631
They do. Bonus points
because they have no idea

09:57.664 --> 09:59.466
what they are sitting on.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.000
Prince wants everyone to love
the idea of the Olympics,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.502
Prince wants everyone to love
the idea of the Olympics,

10:02.535 --> 10:04.304
but, I mean,
obviously they are polarizing.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.000
This app hides that
chatter from social media.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.474
This app hides that
chatter from social media.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.309
Suddenly,
the games are Maroon 5.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.310
Everyone likes them, and nobody
knows how it happened.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.281
This is legit.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.117
But it‘s an add-on.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.000
Quickly copied, which means it
will quickly lose value.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.285
Quickly copied, which means it
will quickly lose value.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.056
So that‘s-- I‘m sorry,

10:23.089 --> 10:24.000
is this you rejecting my idea?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.126
is this you rejecting my idea?

10:26.159 --> 10:27.794
Huh.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.963
That‘s not the choice
I would have made but... okay?

10:29.996 --> 10:30.000
You can invest in it
and keep tabs on it,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.132
You can invest in it
and keep tabs on it,

10:32.165 --> 10:34.900
but it‘s not for us
as a company at this stage.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.478
Prince List
is open for new money.

10:45.511 --> 10:47.847
Incoming calls only,
no roadshow, no begging.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.000
Smart.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.682
Smart.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.000
I want to make an exception
for my alma mater.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.089
I want to make an exception
for my alma mater.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.125
Getting them to sign on
to the list would prove

10:59.158 --> 11:00.000
that you lived up to the promise
you showed back then.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.027
that you lived up to the promise
you showed back then.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.996
Getting them would also
be good business.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.498
So I find myself distracted,

11:05.531 --> 11:06.000
waiting for them to reach out.
Considering calling them myself.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.168
waiting for them to reach out.
Considering calling them myself.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.170
It‘s an unpleasant situation.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.838
And you want me
to alleviate your need,

11:11.871 --> 11:12.000
make you care less.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.540
make you care less.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.341
Well, you can, can‘t you?

11:15.374 --> 11:17.410
I can.

11:17.443 --> 11:18.000
But I won‘t. You need
to sit in the discomfort

11:18.000 --> 11:20.714
But I won‘t. You need
to sit in the discomfort

11:20.747 --> 11:23.750
until you‘re willing to do
something you don‘t want to do.

11:23.783 --> 11:24.000
Hmm.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.285
Hmm.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.586
Abandon them.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.556
That, or make the call.

11:29.589 --> 11:30.000
[door opens]

11:30.000 --> 11:31.024
[door opens]

11:31.057 --> 11:32.892
I‘m not built for this.

11:36.929 --> 11:39.599
Philip wants to use
Socratic elenchus

11:39.632 --> 11:41.935
to find the core beliefs
within his decisions.

11:41.968 --> 11:42.000
And then he critiques
my debate style.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.170
And then he critiques
my debate style.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.907
I won‘t keep doing this
with you here.

11:47.940 --> 11:48.000
I mean, unless you think
hearing my side of things

11:48.000 --> 11:50.376
I mean, unless you think
hearing my side of things

11:50.409 --> 11:51.711
will change your opinion of me?

11:51.744 --> 11:53.079
Unlikely.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.649
I know what I have in you.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.228
[door slams]

12:10.763 --> 12:12.000
I tell myself someday
I‘ll miss you barging in

12:12.000 --> 12:12.799
I tell myself someday
I‘ll miss you barging in

12:12.832 --> 12:15.268
like the great
independent John Anderson

12:15.301 --> 12:16.436
in the ‘80 presidential.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.000
He paved the way
for Perot and--

12:18.000 --> 12:18.571
He paved the way
for Perot and--

12:18.604 --> 12:20.640
State your purpose.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.475
Michael Prince
is taking on investors.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.000
High-level. Exclusive.

12:24.000 --> 12:24.210
High-level. Exclusive.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.246
And I‘m getting in.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.915
Are you notifying me,
or asking my permission?

12:28.948 --> 12:30.000
I‘ll be your man
on the inside,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.284
I‘ll be your man
on the inside,

12:31.317 --> 12:33.286
your Johnny Fedora.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.088
You‘re reading those
books to Willow?

12:35.121 --> 12:36.000
Soon.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.023
Soon.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.326
One, Prince would never fall
for something so obvious.

12:40.359 --> 12:42.000
And two, you‘re a zero short
of Prince List-worthy.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.363
And two, you‘re a zero short
of Prince List-worthy.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.365
I can hear there‘s a three

12:45.398 --> 12:47.467
just dying to be
spoken out loud.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.000
Three is,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.202
Three is,

12:49.235 --> 12:52.005
Fedora hunted Feramontov
to avenge his parents‘ deaths,

12:52.038 --> 12:53.940
not to make himself feel
relevant again

12:53.973 --> 12:54.000
and make some coin.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.375
and make some coin.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.443
You don‘t know shit
about subtext

12:57.476 --> 12:59.345
or how this could help you.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.783
-Are you escorting me out?
-Oh, I am not.

13:03.816 --> 13:06.000
You know the ingress,
you know the egress.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.119
You know the ingress,
you know the egress.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.000
Prince is taking on new
investors for his titular list.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.366
Prince is taking on new
investors for his titular list.

13:20.399 --> 13:23.002
Opening up to finance the train,
that would be my guess.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.000
He needs money, and you
want to cut off his funding.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.872
He needs money, and you
want to cut off his funding.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.474
That seems petty
and limiting.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.000
I want grand.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.543
I want grand.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.845
And useful to the city.

13:35.681 --> 13:36.000
Where are we
on stopping the sale?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.750
Where are we
on stopping the sale?

13:42.955 --> 13:44.557
Hello.

13:47.927 --> 13:48.000
Oh. You want to be
invited in.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.096
Oh. You want to be
invited in.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.698
We could do this
right here.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.333
I don‘t know what
this is.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.000
So, come in,
and we can decide from there.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.234
So, come in,
and we can decide from there.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.047
You want to say
the place looks nice,

14:08.080 --> 14:11.818
but it is entirely unchanged
since you were last here.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.000
And you?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.353
And you?

14:13.386 --> 14:15.054
The same.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.323
I have something for you--

14:17.356 --> 14:18.000
a hundred million ready
to rock in the markets,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.360
a hundred million ready
to rock in the markets,

14:20.393 --> 14:22.528
from just the kind of
investor Prince wants.

14:26.098 --> 14:28.267
I think maybe not
staying so long.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.605
Do you know Leon Sherald?

14:32.638 --> 14:34.540
Ex-NFL star. Activist.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.000
Jim Brown without the weekends
at the Playboy Mansion.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.743
Jim Brown without the weekends
at the Playboy Mansion.

14:36.776 --> 14:40.213
And newly minted hero of
the at-home workout obsessed:

14:40.246 --> 14:41.848
The Combine.

14:41.881 --> 14:42.000
I‘m working with him,

14:42.000 --> 14:43.383
I‘m working with him,

14:43.416 --> 14:45.251
and he wants to get
on the Prince List.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.553
-I don‘t--
-You do.

14:47.586 --> 14:48.000
You have sway.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.555
You have sway.

14:49.588 --> 14:52.625
And you can use that sway
to speak to Prince about Leon.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.828
I know the list is open.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.964
Just get him in the room.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.498
He‘ll do the rest.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.234
I‘d be grateful.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.771
I‘ll mention it.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.000
Thank you.

15:06.000 --> 15:06.673
Thank you.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.708
It is nice that
we can be transactional

15:08.741 --> 15:11.678
and not let our emotions
get in the way.

15:11.711 --> 15:12.000
Saying it out loud
like that‘s a little weird...

15:12.000 --> 15:14.580
Saying it out loud
like that‘s a little weird...

15:18.751 --> 15:20.252
but sure.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.000
Even when I was playing,

15:30.000 --> 15:30.596
Even when I was playing,

15:30.629 --> 15:32.265
it was rare for
an athlete to speak out.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.267
But I felt like
I had an obligation.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.000
Why I told the sneaker company
call the first shoes Obligato.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.170
Why I told the sneaker company
call the first shoes Obligato.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.738
And then you were
off and running.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.240
I was, and it worked
because I always won.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.000
Or won enough.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.142
Or won enough.

15:43.175 --> 15:44.610
I saw that....

15:44.643 --> 15:46.646
that once I was
in people‘s homes,

15:46.679 --> 15:48.000
I could push them,

15:48.000 --> 15:48.147
I could push them,

15:48.180 --> 15:49.782
get them to be active,

15:49.815 --> 15:51.851
more active for the cause.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.319
You wanna look hot
in your bikini? Bet.

15:53.352 --> 15:54.000
Use The Combine.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.188
Use The Combine.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.322
Oh, and, by the way,

15:56.355 --> 15:58.691
you just supported liberation.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.000
-You found a lever.
-Yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.360
-You found a lever.
-Yeah.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.161
And, like when I played,
I delivered.

16:02.194 --> 16:04.430
Those classes, they kick ass.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.000
Talk about the takeover.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.567
Talk about the takeover.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.002
We‘re a week away
from gobbling up

16:09.035 --> 16:10.603
a competing system,

16:10.636 --> 16:12.000
which means we‘ll have
complete control

16:12.000 --> 16:12.305
which means we‘ll have
complete control

16:12.338 --> 16:14.507
over the entire integrated
home workout landscape.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.609
There‘s about to be
a Combine in every home

16:16.642 --> 16:18.000
all over the world.

16:18.000 --> 16:18.277
all over the world.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.114
And I‘d like my
net worth to be....

16:21.147 --> 16:23.882
to be invested by people
who share my values.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.692
The brush-off,
so quick?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.000
Well,

16:36.000 --> 16:36.396
Well,

16:36.429 --> 16:38.131
you‘ve wasted my time.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.332
And his.

16:39.365 --> 16:41.667
They did neither.

16:41.700 --> 16:42.000
This is me welcoming you
on to the Prince List.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.703
This is me welcoming you
on to the Prince List.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.000
[laughs] Oh!
Well then!

16:48.000 --> 16:49.108
[laughs] Oh!
Well then!

16:53.746 --> 16:54.000
Ohh!

16:54.000 --> 16:55.547
Ohh!

17:07.059 --> 17:08.461
Ah.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.029
The man who keeps
his promises

17:10.062 --> 17:11.898
and even dispatched Axelrod.

17:11.931 --> 17:12.000
Oh, he‘s firmly
in my rear-view.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.033
Oh, he‘s firmly
in my rear-view.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.402
What is in front of me

17:16.435 --> 17:18.000
is this $2 billion
donation from Mike Prince

17:18.000 --> 17:19.705
is this $2 billion
donation from Mike Prince

17:19.738 --> 17:21.374
to our subway system.

17:21.407 --> 17:22.875
I find myself befuddled.

17:22.908 --> 17:24.000
And you‘re here
to be de-befuddled?

17:24.000 --> 17:24.644
And you‘re here
to be de-befuddled?

17:24.677 --> 17:27.380
Well, state budgets
are not open to donations.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.981
That‘s how
we prevent billionaires

17:29.014 --> 17:30.000
from buying undue influence.

17:30.000 --> 17:30.650
from buying undue influence.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.519
That donation was cleared
by every lawyer we could find.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.555
And the MTA by-laws
clearly state

17:35.588 --> 17:36.000
that they can accept
any donation,

17:36.000 --> 17:37.290
that they can accept
any donation,

17:37.323 --> 17:41.027
gift or grant
from anyone at any time.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.000
Just because they can
doesn‘t mean they should.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.796
Just because they can
doesn‘t mean they should.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.131
Well, that is inarguable.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.033
Oh, nothing is inarguable.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.000
That‘s why I continue
to thrive.

17:48.000 --> 17:48.734
That‘s why I continue
to thrive.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.305
So, you‘re accepting
the donation,

17:52.338 --> 17:53.973
tainted as it may be,

17:54.006 --> 17:56.642
and giving him the chance
to lean on the city

17:56.675 --> 17:58.377
per his own whims?

17:58.410 --> 18:00.000
Find me a legal reason
to refuse it,

18:00.000 --> 18:00.480
Find me a legal reason
to refuse it,

18:00.513 --> 18:02.482
and I will slap
Michael Prince across the face

18:02.515 --> 18:04.317
the second he walks
through my door,

18:04.350 --> 18:06.000
just for the fun of it.

18:06.000 --> 18:06.686
just for the fun of it.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.387
Until then...

18:10.222 --> 18:12.000
[sighs]

18:12.000 --> 18:12.091
[sighs]

18:14.426 --> 18:16.963
Wheels down in
Indianapolis, 12:30,

18:16.996 --> 18:18.000
meeting at Indiana A&M 1:30 p.m.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.065
meeting at Indiana A&M 1:30 p.m.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.934
We‘ll continue to review
candidates while you‘re gone.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.769
Got a tip from a regulator.

18:23.802 --> 18:24.000
Seems there‘s
an unholy alliance forming

18:24.000 --> 18:25.738
Seems there‘s
an unholy alliance forming

18:25.771 --> 18:27.940
between the transpo workers
and AG‘s office.

18:27.973 --> 18:30.000
You didn‘t discuss this
with Rhoades‘s new you, did you?

18:30.000 --> 18:30.342
You didn‘t discuss this
with Rhoades‘s new you, did you?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.046
Right.

18:34.079 --> 18:35.948
Head of the TWU,
Plimpton, knows Chuck.

18:35.981 --> 18:36.000
Not hard to see the AG took that
opening to mess with our play.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.418
Not hard to see the AG took that
opening to mess with our play.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.254
Transport workers get
to certify all new cars

18:41.287 --> 18:42.000
for safe operation.

18:42.000 --> 18:42.989
for safe operation.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.924
But now they‘re insisting
they won‘t certify yours.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.126
No cert, no union members
to drive them.

18:47.159 --> 18:48.000
Governor Sweeney
needs the union

18:48.000 --> 18:48.628
Governor Sweeney
needs the union

18:48.661 --> 18:50.363
no matter how locked in
we are with him.

18:50.396 --> 18:52.265
So we gotta fix it.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.000
How is leadership going
to sell this to the drivers?

18:54.000 --> 18:54.033
How is leadership going
to sell this to the drivers?

18:54.066 --> 18:55.501
Fewer drivers means job loss.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.537
Yep. And less need
for signaling staff,

18:57.570 --> 18:59.772
putting a quarter of
their employees out of work.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.000
The union‘s going to force
the city to reject your gift.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.241
The union‘s going to force
the city to reject your gift.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.442
Unless?

19:03.475 --> 19:05.077
Two roads.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.000
You can either buy their love
or render them obsolete.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.213
You can either buy their love
or render them obsolete.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.915
Obsolescence takes time,
and we have none,

19:08.948 --> 19:11.217
so I recommend buying them
with a retraining

19:11.250 --> 19:12.000
and job expansion program.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.085
and job expansion program.

19:13.118 --> 19:15.621
-That sounds expensive.
-Oh, it will be.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.956
Offer them whatever you can,
and do it fast.

19:20.025 --> 19:22.628
Isn‘t this getting
too expensive to be worth it?

19:22.661 --> 19:24.000
Not until the torch
is lit in Manhattan.

19:24.000 --> 19:24.664
Not until the torch
is lit in Manhattan.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.299
No other way
to everything you want?

19:26.332 --> 19:27.666
No. And no.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.313
-Stuart.
-Michael Prince.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.000
I loved and hated
seeing you on my schedule.

19:42.000 --> 19:42.949
I loved and hated
seeing you on my schedule.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.817
The one because of everything
you mean to this place,

19:44.850 --> 19:47.420
the other because you‘re
going to ask me a question,

19:47.453 --> 19:48.000
and I am going to say no to it.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.121
and I am going to say no to it.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.000
In the past, when the school

19:54.000 --> 19:55.494
In the past, when the school

19:55.527 --> 19:58.064
refused to invest in my Fund,
well, it was private equity,

19:58.097 --> 20:00.000
and you have rules
about long-term lock-ups.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.066
and you have rules
about long-term lock-ups.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.500
But this is a hedge fund and--

20:01.533 --> 20:03.569
I‘m up on all of that.

20:03.602 --> 20:06.000
I looked to find
a way to say yes.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.273
I looked to find
a way to say yes.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.775
You have 2.9 billion
that could be better managed.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.777
I‘m finally in the
position to do just that.

20:11.810 --> 20:12.000
-Seems an easy yes.
-Isn‘t even my call.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.213
-Seems an easy yes.
-Isn‘t even my call.

20:14.246 --> 20:17.216
We have a Board of Endowments.
They follow guidelines.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.000
Your new fund is too new,
not well enough established.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.320
Your new fund is too new,
not well enough established.

20:21.353 --> 20:24.000
By-laws ask for
a two-year track record.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.790
By-laws ask for
a two-year track record.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.092
They won‘t see you.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.927
No matter how long I wait?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.000
No matter.

20:30.000 --> 20:30.162
No matter.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.431
I know you well enough
to know that you are masking

20:32.464 --> 20:34.634
shock and disappointment.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.000
There‘s some
Indiana John Mellencamp

20:36.000 --> 20:37.003
There‘s some
Indiana John Mellencamp

20:37.036 --> 20:38.938
anger happening, too.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.574
But when I fight authority,
authority does not always win.

20:41.607 --> 20:42.000
No one‘s fighting here.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.309
No one‘s fighting here.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.244
Feels like a beatdown to me.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.913
I‘m the most accomplished alum
Indiana A&M has ever had,

20:47.946 --> 20:48.000
and I‘m ready to
make you a lot of money.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.415
and I‘m ready to
make you a lot of money.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.950
More than I can even donate.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.652
It makes no sense to refuse me.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.000
Academia is not logical.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.788
Academia is not logical.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.055
No, but it is fear-ridden.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.000
You can‘t want me
stumping to replace you

21:00.000 --> 21:00.893
You can‘t want me
stumping to replace you

21:00.926 --> 21:02.594
and the entire
Board of Endowments.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.000
What would make you
hesitate to do that?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.233
What would make you
hesitate to do that?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.302
A fair shot.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.003
Let‘s get the Board to New York.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.000
You get ‘em on the plane.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.805
You get ‘em on the plane.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.907
I‘m going home to craft
a winning argument.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.109
If, after that, they pass,

21:17.142 --> 21:18.000
I accept it.

21:18.000 --> 21:18.677
I accept it.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.000
Who‘s eating what?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.518
Who‘s eating what?

21:25.551 --> 21:27.653
I guess I‘ll do the salmon.

21:27.686 --> 21:28.988
Sauce on the side.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.000
-Please and thanks.
-Good call.

21:30.000 --> 21:30.956
-Please and thanks.
-Good call.

21:30.989 --> 21:32.958
Tuk, add a salmon to
the order for your buddy here.

21:32.991 --> 21:34.860
And I need you down
there four minutes before

21:34.893 --> 21:36.000
they say it‘s ready
so it gets back here piping.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.562
they say it‘s ready
so it gets back here piping.

21:36.595 --> 21:37.697
Got it?

21:37.730 --> 21:39.298
Oh, he has to--

21:39.331 --> 21:40.800
I mean, I thought--

21:40.833 --> 21:42.000
We don‘t really.

21:42.000 --> 21:42.368
We don‘t really.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.337
-I can just go get the food.
-It‘s fine.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.104
He‘s going after he transcribes
this earnings call.

21:52.344 --> 21:53.879
[mouths]
Sorry.

21:53.912 --> 21:54.000
Come meet Sarah Gallagher
with me this afternoon.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.848
Come meet Sarah Gallagher
with me this afternoon.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.350
-Gallagher Nanotech?
-One of the few people

21:57.383 --> 21:58.918
on the list
who merit inclusion.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.000
She‘s brilliant,
like if Fran Lebowitz

22:00.000 --> 22:00.786
She‘s brilliant,
like if Fran Lebowitz

22:00.819 --> 22:02.355
actually had
something new to say,

22:02.388 --> 22:03.956
and she‘s considering
dropping a chunk of

22:03.989 --> 22:05.825
her fortune into our coffers.

22:05.858 --> 22:06.000
Why do you need backup
to close an investor?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.893
Why do you need backup
to close an investor?

22:07.926 --> 22:10.663
If you can‘t gin up
enough fire for the pitch,

22:10.696 --> 22:12.000
just do what I do--

22:12.000 --> 22:12.131
just do what I do--

22:12.164 --> 22:14.033
watch a playlist
of Al Pacino speeches

22:14.066 --> 22:15.468
from Any Given Sunday,
Scent of a Woman.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.069
Always does the trick.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.000
Not lacking enthusiasm.
Sarah doesn‘t like

22:18.000 --> 22:19.238
Not lacking enthusiasm.
Sarah doesn‘t like

22:19.271 --> 22:21.674
to just skim the surface.
She wants a deep dive.

22:21.707 --> 22:24.000
That means I need someone who
speaks engineering to do that.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.176
That means I need someone who
speaks engineering to do that.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.579
Sure thing.
I‘ll be there.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.314
It wasn‘t a yes/no question.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.715
Five-thirty.
Conference room.

22:29.748 --> 22:30.000
Hoo-ahh!

22:30.000 --> 22:31.516
Hoo-ahh!

22:37.990 --> 22:39.592
There‘s no easy way
to do this,

22:39.625 --> 22:41.227
so I‘m just going
to go ahead and do it:

22:41.260 --> 22:42.000
We‘re signing off
on the new subway cars.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.895
We‘re signing off
on the new subway cars.

22:42.928 --> 22:45.297
Oh.

22:45.330 --> 22:48.000
You came to me, Tony.
You asked me for help.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.367
You came to me, Tony.
You asked me for help.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.536
I started to make moves.

22:50.569 --> 22:54.000
And now I‘m in this complicated
and no doubt successful campaign

22:54.000 --> 22:54.240
And now I‘m in this complicated
and no doubt successful campaign

22:54.273 --> 22:56.141
to stop the purchase,
and you‘re bailing?

22:57.609 --> 22:59.278
We have our reasons.

22:59.311 --> 23:00.000
We‘re prepared to create
a $500 million fund

23:00.000 --> 23:01.247
We‘re prepared to create
a $500 million fund

23:01.280 --> 23:04.049
to help with recovery from
redundancy and skill training.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.589
Please tell me
the union behind

23:10.622 --> 23:12.000
the Squeegee Strike was not
satisfied by re-education.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.059
the Squeegee Strike was not
satisfied by re-education.

23:14.092 --> 23:15.528
We were wary.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.862
But they threw in a kicker.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.000
And we invite you to invest

23:18.000 --> 23:18.130
And we invite you to invest

23:18.163 --> 23:19.765
the union‘s money with us.

23:19.798 --> 23:21.200
To be on the Prince List.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.436
You‘ll be the only union
in this round.

23:23.469 --> 23:24.000
Bring your pension plan to us,
we‘ll make you so much money,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.604
Bring your pension plan to us,
we‘ll make you so much money,

23:25.637 --> 23:27.807
you‘ll forget subway cars
ever had two drivers,

23:27.840 --> 23:30.000
and you‘ll be looking to hire
one for your Bentley.

23:30.000 --> 23:30.576
and you‘ll be looking to hire
one for your Bentley.

23:30.609 --> 23:33.479
This is a really good offer,
and normally I would say yes,

23:33.512 --> 23:36.000
but our pension fund
is mixed in with other

23:36.000 --> 23:36.449
but our pension fund
is mixed in with other

23:36.482 --> 23:37.817
New York City employees.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.819
Police, Housing Authority.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.654
CUNY.

23:41.687 --> 23:42.000
The rest.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.289
The rest.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.090
I can‘t speak for them.

23:45.123 --> 23:46.859
But you can convince them.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.000
Right?

23:48.000 --> 23:48.026
Right?

23:49.995 --> 23:52.031
You cannot set a man
on a task

23:52.064 --> 23:54.000
and then abandon him
because of temptation.

23:54.000 --> 23:54.834
and then abandon him
because of temptation.

23:54.867 --> 23:57.436
No. That‘s giving in
to the devil at your elbow.

23:57.469 --> 24:00.000
Satan or angel,
the other unions are in too.

24:00.000 --> 24:00.206
Satan or angel,
the other unions are in too.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.641
They didn‘t hardly
need convincing.

24:02.674 --> 24:04.276
It‘s like when a female teacher

24:04.309 --> 24:06.000
takes a 16-year-old
male student for a ride.

24:06.000 --> 24:06.245
takes a 16-year-old
male student for a ride.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.814
Not much in the way of
enticing needs to happen

24:08.847 --> 24:11.817
‘cause it‘s all the kid‘s
been after anyway.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.087
Teacher still goes to jail.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.689
How often you think
that one gets reported, Chuck?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.626
We‘re signing off
with Michael Prince.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.000
Transport workers aren‘t
going to stand with us.

24:30.000 --> 24:30.535
Transport workers aren‘t
going to stand with us.

24:32.237 --> 24:35.708
Prince swayed them
with visions of sugarplums.

24:35.741 --> 24:36.000
Let‘s go to Tess Johnson.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.943
Let‘s go to Tess Johnson.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.446
Mayor‘s Office can recall
the lease on the subway lines.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.000
She can,
but why would she?

24:42.000 --> 24:42.014
She can,
but why would she?

24:42.047 --> 24:44.350
Proletariat
win for the city.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.652
A blow against
billionaire overreach. It plays.

24:46.685 --> 24:48.000
I think she‘ll want to avoid
grinding a city to a halt

24:48.000 --> 24:49.154
I think she‘ll want to avoid
grinding a city to a halt

24:49.187 --> 24:50.622
that just got moving again.

24:52.958 --> 24:54.000
Where you going?

24:54.000 --> 24:54.326
Where you going?

24:54.359 --> 24:57.062
I like to move around
when I know

24:57.095 --> 24:58.930
a building‘s about to
fall on me. Okay.

25:00.966 --> 25:03.536
Okay, we claim donations
of funds for training

25:03.569 --> 25:05.538
to a union could be
considered a bribe.

25:05.571 --> 25:06.000
But for the presence of
Kate Sacker at Prince‘s side,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.373
But for the presence of
Kate Sacker at Prince‘s side,

25:07.406 --> 25:09.208
we could succeed.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.810
But she‘ll know how to rebut
that argument in court.

25:13.478 --> 25:15.413
Um, um....

25:18.750 --> 25:20.152
See?

25:20.185 --> 25:21.720
Moving helps, right?

25:21.753 --> 25:23.955
Better than sitting
on our asses.

25:43.742 --> 25:46.512
[paper rustles]

25:46.545 --> 25:48.000
Scooter‘s not coming?

25:48.000 --> 25:48.414
Scooter‘s not coming?

25:48.447 --> 25:50.716
He got pulled away
by what, exactly?

25:50.749 --> 25:52.952
I got the note.
I was told to deliver it.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.000
I did not stop
to read it along the way.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.821
I did not stop
to read it along the way.

25:55.854 --> 25:57.689
[sighs]

26:07.966 --> 26:10.836
Sarah, hi.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.000
[inaudible]

26:12.000 --> 26:13.471
[inaudible]

26:17.542 --> 26:18.000
Oh!

26:18.000 --> 26:18.611
Oh!

26:18.644 --> 26:20.278
[muted laughter]

26:25.484 --> 26:27.086
[knocks]

26:27.119 --> 26:30.000
You‘re ready to
place me on the inside?

26:30.000 --> 26:30.122
You‘re ready to
place me on the inside?

26:30.155 --> 26:31.757
The world is
an ever-changing place.

26:31.790 --> 26:34.259
But, no, you‘re still not
getting tagged in.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.000
But I am curious

26:36.000 --> 26:37.129
But I am curious

26:37.162 --> 26:39.932
how you knew the
Prince List was opening up.

26:39.965 --> 26:42.000
Since the smiling
chrome-domed bastard booted me,

26:42.000 --> 26:43.936
Since the smiling
chrome-domed bastard booted me,

26:43.969 --> 26:45.337
I‘ve kept close tabs.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.940
A constant,
vigilant surveillance.

26:47.973 --> 26:48.000
Close enough to know
what he‘s doing,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.441
Close enough to know
what he‘s doing,

26:49.474 --> 26:51.477
-but not entirely on the inside.
-Not yet.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.278
And without a source
close to Prince,

26:53.311 --> 26:54.000
you‘ll just be guessing blind
at his attacks and defenses.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.749
you‘ll just be guessing blind
at his attacks and defenses.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.851
Like that asinine board game

26:58.884 --> 27:00.000
you used to dragoon me into
playing with you all the time.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.320
you used to dragoon me into
playing with you all the time.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.821
Stratego.

27:02.854 --> 27:05.057
A classic contest
of battlefield strategy.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.000
Oh, and you can‘t tell me
you‘re still bitter

27:06.000 --> 27:07.059
Oh, and you can‘t tell me
you‘re still bitter

27:07.092 --> 27:08.761
you could never win.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.764
Children‘s games are skewed
to the child‘s mind.

27:11.797 --> 27:12.000
I‘ll put my money on
Willow in two years‘ time

27:12.000 --> 27:14.066
I‘ll put my money on
Willow in two years‘ time

27:14.099 --> 27:15.834
if you care for a rematch.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.903
Oh, no doubt she‘ll wipe
the board with me.

27:17.936 --> 27:18.000
Until then,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.805
Until then,

27:19.838 --> 27:22.307
you can get me the names
of the contenders

27:22.340 --> 27:24.000
for Prince‘s list.

27:24.000 --> 27:24.009
for Prince‘s list.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.912
As I am not a retriever,
nor do I wish to be,

27:26.945 --> 27:28.814
I will ignore the command

27:28.847 --> 27:30.000
and assume you
already know my friends

27:30.000 --> 27:31.617
and assume you
already know my friends

27:31.650 --> 27:33.318
are keeping me
well-informed.

27:33.351 --> 27:36.000
I do, and if you‘d
share that information,

27:36.000 --> 27:37.122
I do, and if you‘d
share that information,

27:37.155 --> 27:38.590
that would be great.

27:44.529 --> 27:46.965
Constant vigilance.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.000
It is the only way.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.567
It is the only way.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.235
Clearly.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.000
Thank you.

27:54.000 --> 27:54.873
Thank you.

27:54.906 --> 27:56.909
That‘s all?

27:56.942 --> 28:00.000
I am grateful
for your assistance.

28:00.000 --> 28:00.445
I am grateful
for your assistance.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.156
What?

28:11.189 --> 28:12.000
You‘re taking a class.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.826
You‘re taking a class.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.994
Okay. And why?

28:16.027 --> 28:18.000
Because I know
how to take all that

28:18.000 --> 28:18.130
Because I know
how to take all that

28:18.163 --> 28:20.566
shiny new subway money
away from Michael Prince

28:20.599 --> 28:22.400
and give it to the people.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.538
["I Can‘t Quit"
by the Vaccines plays]

28:32.177 --> 28:33.879
[Leon] Come on!
Come on! Come on!

28:33.912 --> 28:35.714
Hurry!

28:35.747 --> 28:36.000
Nice.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.316
Nice.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.984
Fifteen seconds
between you and greatness.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.085
Come on! Let‘s go! Let‘s go!

28:40.118 --> 28:42.000
Whoo! [claps] Yes.

28:42.000 --> 28:42.421
Whoo! [claps] Yes.

28:42.454 --> 28:45.758
That‘s what I‘m talking about.
That‘s what I‘m talking about.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.426
All right, vertical jump,
touch the sky.

28:47.459 --> 28:48.000
Touch the sky.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.061
Touch the sky.

28:49.094 --> 28:50.863
I want to see air
between you and the ground.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.397
That‘s right.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.000
Yeah, good job, Britney.
Good job, Carter.

28:54.000 --> 28:54.032
Yeah, good job, Britney.
Good job, Carter.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.068
Good hustle, y‘all.
Good hustle.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.470
[panting]

28:58.503 --> 28:59.838
Good.

29:03.341 --> 29:04.910
That was intense.

29:04.943 --> 29:06.000
Hmm.

29:06.000 --> 29:06.345
Hmm.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.747
I‘m usually on my own,
at home.

29:08.780 --> 29:11.350
But I have to say
this whole community thing

29:11.383 --> 29:12.000
is way more inspiring.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.385
is way more inspiring.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.254
Hell, yeah, it is.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.789
I want to ask about something,
if you don‘t mind,

29:16.822 --> 29:18.000
before I buy that
ten-pack of classes.

29:18.000 --> 29:18.257
before I buy that
ten-pack of classes.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.958
Yeah, all right. Hit me.

29:19.991 --> 29:22.127
I just heard that you‘re making
one of those alliances

29:22.160 --> 29:24.000
like when SoulCycle did
that event for President--

29:24.000 --> 29:24.797
like when SoulCycle did
that event for President--

29:24.830 --> 29:26.365
That wasn‘t SoulCycle
as a company.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.066
It was just
one of their owners.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.568
Who remembers?

29:29.601 --> 29:30.000
I just know how bad
it hurt them.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.637
I just know how bad
it hurt them.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.939
It‘s why I‘m worried
about you and the NYPD.

29:33.972 --> 29:36.000
Oh, that‘s the last group
that I‘d throw in with.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.041
Oh, that‘s the last group
that I‘d throw in with.

29:36.074 --> 29:38.443
In fact, I‘ve divested
this company entirely

29:38.476 --> 29:40.946
of any organization whose
values contradict mine.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.000
Except for the Prince List.

29:42.000 --> 29:42.914
Except for the Prince List.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.653
[Prince]
I take this so seriously,

29:47.686 --> 29:48.000
I‘ve convened my advisory board.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.922
I‘ve convened my advisory board.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.124
I will not have my money
in the same fund as the cops.

29:52.157 --> 29:54.000
Transport workers,
that‘s one thing, but not cops.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.460
Transport workers,
that‘s one thing, but not cops.

29:55.493 --> 29:57.963
My Combine-ers won‘t have it,
and I won‘t have it.

29:57.996 --> 29:59.665
Dump their pension money,

29:59.698 --> 30:00.000
or I‘m going public.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.700
or I‘m going public.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.635
And I‘m not going to be
quiet about it.

30:03.668 --> 30:06.000
Police officers have a right
to well-managed pensions.

30:06.000 --> 30:06.038
Police officers have a right
to well-managed pensions.

30:06.071 --> 30:07.206
They do.

30:07.239 --> 30:10.108
Not all cops are bad,
I get it.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.000
But I will not have
my money co-mingled.

30:12.000 --> 30:12.177
But I will not have
my money co-mingled.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.880
I‘ve already spoken to
six other new Prince Listers.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.515
If I walk, they will walk.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.000
The problem
with confidential lists is

30:18.000 --> 30:18.183
The problem
with confidential lists is

30:18.216 --> 30:19.551
they don‘t stay confidential.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.653
No, they don‘t.

30:21.686 --> 30:24.000
The Combine will not be said
in the same breath as NYPD.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.825
The Combine will not be said
in the same breath as NYPD.

30:26.858 --> 30:29.261
When a health and fitness brand
is diluted by scandal,

30:29.294 --> 30:30.000
it ceases to have a clear
and consistent message.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.264
it ceases to have a clear
and consistent message.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.166
And when that happens,
the value of the brand,

30:34.199 --> 30:36.000
it plummets.

30:36.000 --> 30:36.168
it plummets.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.403
That‘s why you‘re going
to drop transport.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.044
Do the smart thing.

30:50.949 --> 30:52.918
Mike, it‘s time
for moral leadership.

30:52.951 --> 30:54.000
[Blumenthal]
I agree with Jaclyn.

30:54.000 --> 30:54.820
[Blumenthal]
I agree with Jaclyn.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.121
The world has changed.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.723
And, frankly,
I think, for the better.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.791
I‘m not deaf to the cause.
I support it.

30:59.824 --> 31:00.000
But I‘ve never had
a damn investor

31:00.000 --> 31:01.827
But I‘ve never had
a damn investor

31:01.860 --> 31:03.762
dictate terms to me
in my life.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.864
That goes back to when I was 19.
I‘m not starting now.

31:05.897 --> 31:06.000
The times shift,
and we decide,

31:06.000 --> 31:09.201
The times shift,
and we decide,

31:09.234 --> 31:10.669
do we stay where we are?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.000
And if we do stay,
and they move--

31:12.000 --> 31:12.771
And if we do stay,
and they move--

31:12.804 --> 31:14.840
[Grant] Mike,
this could be existential.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.075
Most times, there‘s a path
to integrating interests.

31:17.108 --> 31:18.000
But here, it seems like
the positions are zero sum.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.245
But here, it seems like
the positions are zero sum.

31:20.278 --> 31:22.714
[Einhorn] I know all about
not listening to people

31:22.747 --> 31:24.000
when they tell you
that you‘re wrong.

31:24.000 --> 31:24.449
when they tell you
that you‘re wrong.

31:24.482 --> 31:26.585
But sometimes,
in some circumstances,

31:26.618 --> 31:29.154
you just gotta
go along to get along.

31:29.187 --> 31:30.000
Or you‘re going to be facing
an exodus we can‘t afford.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.957
Or you‘re going to be facing
an exodus we can‘t afford.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.092
I‘m not planning on one
unless it‘s led by me.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.000
No, we‘re keeping everyone
on the list, on the list.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.729
No, we‘re keeping everyone
on the list, on the list.

31:37.762 --> 31:39.431
This is on me.
I walked him in here.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.066
I‘ll go get him
straightened out.

31:41.099 --> 31:42.000
Yes. Get him happy.

31:42.000 --> 31:42.433
Yes. Get him happy.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.222
So what‘re we eating today?

32:04.255 --> 32:06.000
I‘m on a Q&A for
Three Star Games‘ earning call,

32:06.000 --> 32:07.793
I‘m on a Q&A for
Three Star Games‘ earning call,

32:07.826 --> 32:09.661
and this guy from Spartan-Ives

32:09.694 --> 32:11.930
asked about digital
learning in NPCs.

32:11.963 --> 32:12.000
Non-player characters. AI.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.766
Non-player characters. AI.

32:14.799 --> 32:17.169
The characters in the game
learn from the player

32:17.202 --> 32:18.000
and make the game
harder to beat.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.304
and make the game
harder to beat.

32:19.337 --> 32:21.239
Guy is geeking out.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.976
I think Spartan-Ives
is about to make a major play.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.978
-In games?
-No.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.013
In underlying AI.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.000
Three Star contracted out
to a company called 2RL Systems.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.984
Three Star contracted out
to a company called 2RL Systems.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.852
That‘s some organic
intelligence on your part.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.053
Get me the trading desk.

32:35.086 --> 32:36.000
You‘re going
to make the play?

32:36.000 --> 32:36.621
You‘re going
to make the play?

32:36.654 --> 32:38.690
Yeah, it‘s a great find
in a space

32:38.723 --> 32:40.859
where I‘m underrepresented.
You‘re good at this.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.000
It‘s what I was meant to do.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.228
It‘s what I was meant to do.

32:43.261 --> 32:45.197
Much to my mother‘s dismay.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.632
Yeah, I can‘t help
you with her.

32:47.665 --> 32:48.000
But I‘ll tell you this:

32:48.000 --> 32:49.801
But I‘ll tell you this:

32:49.834 --> 32:51.903
Don‘t be beta.

32:51.936 --> 32:54.000
Ben Kim told me
you wanted to go smaller.

32:54.000 --> 32:54.139
Ben Kim told me
you wanted to go smaller.

32:54.172 --> 32:57.042
He owned the mistake.
He‘s a good friend.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.311
But you‘ve got
to make your own calls

32:59.344 --> 33:00.000
and live or die by them.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.313
and live or die by them.

33:01.346 --> 33:02.948
Like you just did.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.000
Now, what do you want to eat?
It‘s my day to pick up.

33:06.000 --> 33:06.351
Now, what do you want to eat?
It‘s my day to pick up.

33:06.384 --> 33:09.420
I‘m thinking Thai.
But after we book the trade.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.127
I‘m a fan.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.195
Of your work here
and in the public space.

33:17.228 --> 33:18.000
I usually have to spend time
convincing people that doing

33:18.000 --> 33:19.297
I usually have to spend time
convincing people that doing

33:19.330 --> 33:21.633
what is right can live alongside
what is profitable.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.969
I often use you
as an example of just that.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.404
I appreciate that,

33:25.437 --> 33:27.406
and I appreciate you
coming down here.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.574
The respect it conveys.

33:29.607 --> 33:30.000
But, um,

33:30.000 --> 33:31.510
But, um,

33:31.543 --> 33:34.179
I‘m not interested in
whatever list of Prince-approved

33:34.212 --> 33:35.480
sweeteners that
you came here with.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.000
Are you sure?

33:36.000 --> 33:36.882
Are you sure?

33:36.915 --> 33:38.083
You don‘t even want
to peruse the menu?

33:38.116 --> 33:40.786
[laughs]

33:40.819 --> 33:42.000
All I need from you

33:42.000 --> 33:42.287
All I need from you

33:42.320 --> 33:44.022
is a promise that you‘ll
drop the union money

33:44.055 --> 33:45.624
so the cops drop along with it.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.092
We can‘t do that.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.000
And, if I am being
honest with you,

33:48.000 --> 33:48.727
And, if I am being
honest with you,

33:48.760 --> 33:50.362
as a person who cares
about justice,

33:50.395 --> 33:51.963
I‘m not sure that
it is the right thing.

33:51.996 --> 33:53.532
As our clients,
we can bring them to the table

33:53.565 --> 33:54.000
to discuss real reform.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.033
to discuss real reform.

33:55.066 --> 33:57.536
I‘ve been down
that road to nowhere.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.371
They need to be cut
from the herd.

33:59.404 --> 34:00.000
And you want to know
how I know I‘m right?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.174
And you want to know
how I know I‘m right?

34:02.207 --> 34:03.708
People are ready to follow me,

34:03.741 --> 34:06.000
and I didn‘t
have to ask them twice.

34:06.000 --> 34:06.244
and I didn‘t
have to ask them twice.

34:06.277 --> 34:08.547
-Maybe--
-They followed you

34:08.580 --> 34:09.915
because you told
them if they didn‘t,

34:09.948 --> 34:11.383
they were morally corrupt

34:11.416 --> 34:12.000
and you‘d tell
the world about it.

34:12.000 --> 34:12.584
and you‘d tell
the world about it.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.286
Burn ‘em on social.

34:14.319 --> 34:15.520
That‘s not leadership,
it‘s extortion.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.722
Nobody cares about the why.

34:17.755 --> 34:18.000
They just care
that it happened

34:18.000 --> 34:19.758
They just care
that it happened

34:19.791 --> 34:22.527
and that they will be
dragged in the public sphere.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.000
I‘m right.

34:24.000 --> 34:24.096
I‘m right.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.231
I have a platform,
I have support.

34:26.264 --> 34:29.600
And... this isn‘t
a negotiation.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.806
You should consider sticking
around for 6:15 boot camp.

34:40.778 --> 34:42.000
-I can--
-You asked me for this.

34:42.000 --> 34:42.881
-I can--
-You asked me for this.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.883
He didn‘t even qualify
at a measly hundred mil,

34:44.916 --> 34:46.318
and I personally vouched
for him and for you.

34:46.351 --> 34:47.986
And now he‘s playing
Woke Spartacus?

34:48.019 --> 34:49.754
Well, when I asked you,

34:49.787 --> 34:51.656
I didn‘t know
we‘d be throwing in

34:51.689 --> 34:53.758
with state-sanctioned killers.

34:53.791 --> 34:54.000
I am not indifferent
to the issue.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.827
I am not indifferent
to the issue.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.696
But the carceral system
isn‘t going to change

34:57.729 --> 35:00.000
because one guy takes
his toys and goes home.

35:00.000 --> 35:00.165
because one guy takes
his toys and goes home.

35:00.198 --> 35:01.833
Carceral system.

35:01.866 --> 35:03.135
Hmm.

35:03.168 --> 35:04.936
Has a nice distancing effect.

35:04.969 --> 35:06.000
Perhaps you have that luxury.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.038
Perhaps you have that luxury.

35:07.071 --> 35:09.641
Or maybe you
just make that choice.

35:09.674 --> 35:12.000
But we are going to do
something about it.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.110
But we are going to do
something about it.

35:12.143 --> 35:13.612
Or as much as we can.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.647
Whilst doing that,
why not figure out how

35:15.680 --> 35:18.000
we can satisfy his needs
without us sacrificing capital?

35:18.000 --> 35:18.283
we can satisfy his needs
without us sacrificing capital?

35:18.316 --> 35:21.786
Because those things
are in direct conflict.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.000
It was nice to see you.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.023
It was nice to see you.

35:25.056 --> 35:26.958
Until it wasn‘t.

35:28.693 --> 35:30.000
[door opens]

35:30.000 --> 35:30.495
[door opens]

35:39.170 --> 35:40.639
Well then.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.000
Hello.

35:42.000 --> 35:42.274
Hello.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.142
Sarah Gallagher called
to say she‘s thrilled to be

35:44.175 --> 35:45.944
-on the Prince List.
-Excellent.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.045
And she‘s offered Philip
a job as CTO.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.000
You set me up.

35:48.000 --> 35:48.713
You set me up.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.815
To close a deal for your boss,
yes, I set you up.

35:50.848 --> 35:52.651
If there were
unintended consequences--

35:52.684 --> 35:54.000
Entirely
and completely intended.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.053
Entirely
and completely intended.

35:55.086 --> 35:56.721
You want me out of
Michael Prince Capital.

35:56.754 --> 35:58.757
I didn‘t want you here
at all, but you are.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.000
And while it wasn‘t my plan,
it wasn‘t entirely unexpected.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.726
And while it wasn‘t my plan,
it wasn‘t entirely unexpected.

36:01.759 --> 36:03.995
Sarah Gallagher‘s company
would be a better fit for you,

36:04.028 --> 36:05.997
and she knew that
without me prompting her.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.933
No, no.
You just don‘t like me here,

36:07.966 --> 36:09.701
getting my hands soiled by that
filthy Continental Currency.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.000
You are meant for better
things than this place.

36:12.000 --> 36:12.170
You are meant for better
things than this place.

36:18.142 --> 36:19.410
Give us a moment.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.000
I‘m not taking that job.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.716
I‘m not taking that job.

36:24.749 --> 36:26.384
Walk it off. Now.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.197
We know where this leads.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.865
We do.

36:40.898 --> 36:42.000
I wanted to keep him out
of here for as long as possible.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.335
I wanted to keep him out
of here for as long as possible.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.338
And you did,
and now he‘s here.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.000
Because he is exactly
the kind of talent

36:48.000 --> 36:48.106
Because he is exactly
the kind of talent

36:48.139 --> 36:50.075
this place needs
for where it‘s going.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.744
For after.

36:52.777 --> 36:54.000
I will consult you,

36:54.000 --> 36:54.613
I will consult you,

36:54.646 --> 36:56.414
and I will rely on you,

36:56.447 --> 36:58.683
and I will trust you
as long as you‘ll ride with me.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.000
But I can‘t run my business
to make you happy.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.652
But I can‘t run my business
to make you happy.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.000
I got confirmation that Legere
and the Indiana A&M board

37:06.000 --> 37:06.324
I got confirmation that Legere
and the Indiana A&M board

37:06.357 --> 37:08.326
are checked in
at the Four Seasons.

37:08.359 --> 37:11.496
Cars drop them here at 8:30 a.m.
for breakfast and the pitch.

37:11.529 --> 37:12.000
I‘ll be ready.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.364
I‘ll be ready.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.000
Mr. Legere, welcome to Michael
Prince Capital.

37:30.000 --> 37:30.248
Mr. Legere, welcome to Michael
Prince Capital.

37:30.281 --> 37:32.583
-Thank you.
-Please follow me.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.000
[Prince] You‘ve all
seen the pitch deck.

37:36.000 --> 37:36.087
[Prince] You‘ve all
seen the pitch deck.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.557
But let‘s get beyond
the numbers and the names.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.393
I‘m from Indiana.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.000
Grew up there.
Went to school there.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.261
Grew up there.
Went to school there.

37:43.294 --> 37:45.797
I know your families.
I know your histories.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.999
And, yes,
I know your goals.

37:49.300 --> 37:50.935
You want everything consistent,

37:50.968 --> 37:52.904
and I appreciate that.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.000
You see a 17% returns,
year after year,

37:54.000 --> 37:55.307
You see a 17% returns,
year after year,

37:55.340 --> 37:56.975
and you like it.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.177
‘Cause you‘re
not greedy and it‘s reliable,

37:59.210 --> 38:00.000
like Indiana corn being
knee-high by the Fourth of July.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.180
like Indiana corn being
knee-high by the Fourth of July.

38:02.213 --> 38:03.948
[gentle laughter]

38:03.981 --> 38:05.517
But I‘m here to tell you,
that‘s not the world anymore.

38:05.550 --> 38:06.000
We‘ve seen it clearly.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.086
We‘ve seen it clearly.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.255
So, you need someone
who can make you 60%

38:10.288 --> 38:12.000
or 600 in a year

38:12.000 --> 38:12.324
or 600 in a year

38:12.357 --> 38:13.825
to survive the 10%.

38:13.858 --> 38:15.927
So you can survive
the negative years.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.000
In an unpredictable market,

38:18.000 --> 38:18.096
In an unpredictable market,

38:18.129 --> 38:20.165
you need non-correlated returns.

38:20.198 --> 38:23.601
I can give you that, while
also maintaining investments

38:23.634 --> 38:24.000
that are thoughtful,
moral,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.471
that are thoughtful,
moral,

38:26.504 --> 38:28.473
and for the betterment
of our planet.

38:28.506 --> 38:30.000
You get to know
you‘re doing good

38:30.000 --> 38:31.242
You get to know
you‘re doing good

38:31.275 --> 38:33.078
and doing the best there is

38:33.111 --> 38:35.747
for the student body
at Indy A&M.

38:35.780 --> 38:36.000
There‘s very little in the world
that feels better than that.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.452
There‘s very little in the world
that feels better than that.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.000
Maybe winning
an NCAA championship,

38:42.000 --> 38:42.554
Maybe winning
an NCAA championship,

38:42.587 --> 38:43.988
but not much else.

38:44.021 --> 38:45.323
[laughter]

38:46.858 --> 38:48.000
That was a fantastic
proposal, Mike.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.294
That was a fantastic
proposal, Mike.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.328
And we‘ll discuss it.

38:50.361 --> 38:51.396
And consider it.

38:51.429 --> 38:52.897
Of course.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.000
Let me walk you out.

38:54.000 --> 38:54.832
Let me walk you out.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.307
He killed it.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.943
Stabbed it
in its tiny corn-fed heart

39:04.976 --> 39:06.000
and fried it up
for the state fair.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.011
and fried it up
for the state fair.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.646
That‘s the vibe you got?

39:08.679 --> 39:11.149
No. They took
the hayride out here

39:11.182 --> 39:12.000
so they could
reject him to his face.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.352
so they could
reject him to his face.

39:14.385 --> 39:16.521
I‘m asking you
to hold the tweets

39:16.554 --> 39:18.000
-until we have a statement.
-[computer tweet alerts]

39:18.000 --> 39:18.223
-until we have a statement.
-[computer tweet alerts]

39:18.256 --> 39:20.358
These claims are unfounded,
and we deserve--

39:20.391 --> 39:23.361
Oh, hell fuckin‘ no!

39:23.394 --> 39:24.000
What?!

39:24.000 --> 39:24.729
What?!

39:27.098 --> 39:29.066
I‘m gonna have to call you back.

39:32.503 --> 39:34.205
Oh, I make it a policy
not to engage

39:34.238 --> 39:36.000
in anything with hearts
and thumbs-up underneath.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.174
in anything with hearts
and thumbs-up underneath.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.410
You really
have to stay current.

39:38.443 --> 39:39.744
[Chuck sighs]

39:39.777 --> 39:41.379
This is the
complete destruction

39:41.412 --> 39:42.000
of Leon Sherald‘s
reputation online.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.748
of Leon Sherald‘s
reputation online.

39:43.781 --> 39:46.017
He‘s been accused of
stealing The Combine.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.000
Accusation‘s stuck.

39:48.000 --> 39:48.253
Accusation‘s stuck.

39:48.286 --> 39:51.122
Rumors dating back to his
fraternity days are surfacing.

39:51.155 --> 39:53.191
The stock is in free fall,

39:53.224 --> 39:54.000
and it looks like he may have to
step down from his own company.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.094
and it looks like he may have to
step down from his own company.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.062
Our target is being targeted.

39:58.095 --> 39:59.697
Have you reached out to help?

39:59.730 --> 40:00.000
He‘s hiding behind
a crisis manager

40:00.000 --> 40:01.299
He‘s hiding behind
a crisis manager

40:01.332 --> 40:03.234
who won‘t engage with me.

40:03.267 --> 40:05.236
My guess is they think
we‘ll come after him

40:05.269 --> 40:06.000
for intellectual property theft.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.439
for intellectual property theft.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.774
It‘s either bad luck
with conspicuous timing,

40:09.807 --> 40:11.209
or....

40:11.242 --> 40:12.000
somehow Mike Prince
neutralized him.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.311
somehow Mike Prince
neutralized him.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.146
But that somehow
is immaterial

40:15.179 --> 40:17.282
if your meeting today
goes as planned.

40:17.315 --> 40:18.000
I have no reason
to believe it won‘t.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.751
I have no reason
to believe it won‘t.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.519
Then don‘t worry about Leon.

40:21.552 --> 40:23.488
You are armed
and ready for combat,

40:23.521 --> 40:24.000
and I expect you
to return victorious.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.157
and I expect you
to return victorious.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.432
[Sacker]
Ready to finalize

40:34.465 --> 40:36.000
the subway car
purchase when you are.

40:36.000 --> 40:36.367
the subway car
purchase when you are.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.970
Purchase order
for the factory?

40:39.003 --> 40:40.705
This confirms that
Michael Prince Capital

40:40.738 --> 40:42.000
will order the cars
directly from them

40:42.000 --> 40:42.140
will order the cars
directly from them

40:42.173 --> 40:43.675
and will donate them
as soon as they come off

40:43.708 --> 40:45.276
the production line.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.045
Our ownership will be temporary,
a matter of minutes.

40:47.078 --> 40:48.000
Why do these rich boys always
want to buy shiny things

40:48.000 --> 40:49.347
Why do these rich boys always
want to buy shiny things

40:49.380 --> 40:50.715
that go fast?

40:50.748 --> 40:51.716
[knock on door]

40:51.749 --> 40:53.117
Yeah?

40:53.150 --> 40:54.000
Ah, the AG‘s office
has some concerns,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.988
Ah, the AG‘s office
has some concerns,

40:57.021 --> 40:59.724
so instead of
delaying your deal,

40:59.757 --> 41:00.000
I thought we could orchestrate
a productive dialogue.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.393
I thought we could orchestrate
a productive dialogue.

41:02.426 --> 41:03.962
Sure. Let‘s dialogue.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.630
I was expecting Dave.

41:05.663 --> 41:06.000
Letters of support
from the governor, the mayor,

41:06.000 --> 41:07.632
Letters of support
from the governor, the mayor,

41:07.665 --> 41:09.033
the Transport Workers Union.
I didn‘t make you copies.

41:09.066 --> 41:10.869
-I trust you.
-If they have an acronym

41:10.902 --> 41:12.000
on a polyester windbreaker,
they are supporting this.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.804
on a polyester windbreaker,
they are supporting this.

41:12.837 --> 41:14.939
And so is the
Attorney General‘s office.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.774
But we have a problem

41:16.807 --> 41:18.000
that no amount of our complete
and total support can fix.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.110
that no amount of our complete
and total support can fix.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.879
Is that right?

41:20.912 --> 41:23.281
The MTA can‘t use Mr. Prince‘s
money to buy the cars,

41:23.314 --> 41:24.000
and Prince can‘t use
Prince‘s money to buy the cars

41:24.000 --> 41:25.483
and Prince can‘t use
Prince‘s money to buy the cars

41:25.516 --> 41:27.352
because they are Chinese cars.

41:27.385 --> 41:29.654
No. They are made
in Wisconsin, U.S.A.

41:29.687 --> 41:30.000
[Dave] By a Chinese-
owned company.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.356
[Dave] By a Chinese-
owned company.

41:31.389 --> 41:34.726
And, as xenophobic
as it may be in its inception,

41:34.759 --> 41:36.000
Federal law prohibits
the purchase,

41:36.000 --> 41:36.394
Federal law prohibits
the purchase,

41:36.427 --> 41:38.362
and the state will
abide by that on this one.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.468
I‘d like to see the language
on the Federal provision?

41:48.739 --> 41:50.275
I‘ll challenge this in court.

41:50.308 --> 41:52.610
Challenging
a Federal law in court

41:52.643 --> 41:54.000
would definitely put the
New York state budget at risk.

41:54.000 --> 41:54.913
would definitely put the
New York state budget at risk.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.848
I worry that
even attempting this

41:56.881 --> 41:58.883
will bring a Federal case
that would jeopardize

41:58.916 --> 42:00.000
all those Federal funds that
flow into the state treasury.

42:00.000 --> 42:00.752
all those Federal funds that
flow into the state treasury.

42:00.785 --> 42:02.387
Oh, that‘s your worry?

42:02.420 --> 42:03.588
This donation is
the best thing to happen

42:03.621 --> 42:05.156
to the city and state.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.000
While I can‘t sign off
on anything that

42:06.000 --> 42:07.158
While I can‘t sign off
on anything that

42:07.191 --> 42:09.327
threatens our Federal funds,

42:09.360 --> 42:10.995
the unions and the state

42:11.028 --> 42:12.000
are always supportive
of buying American.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.698
are always supportive
of buying American.

42:13.731 --> 42:15.533
How about that?

42:15.566 --> 42:18.000
No American-owned manufacturer
can make the cars in time

42:18.000 --> 42:18.403
No American-owned manufacturer
can make the cars in time

42:18.436 --> 42:20.271
for the New York Olympics.

42:20.304 --> 42:23.207
Well, that is a shame.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.000
It really is.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.775
It really is.

42:29.780 --> 42:30.000
-You were great in there.
-Don‘t fucking patronize me.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.216
-You were great in there.
-Don‘t fucking patronize me.

42:32.249 --> 42:33.952
I would never.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.000
So tell me what you
picked up off me when we met.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.322
So tell me what you
picked up off me when we met.

42:37.355 --> 42:39.924
You said how quickly things
move in the private sector.

42:39.957 --> 42:42.000
Speed was clearly
the top priority.

42:42.000 --> 42:42.560
Speed was clearly
the top priority.

42:42.593 --> 42:44.629
From there, it was a matter of
finding the right law to use

42:44.662 --> 42:46.598
to slow you down
to where the cars

42:46.631 --> 42:48.000
were worthless to your boss.

42:48.000 --> 42:48.032
were worthless to your boss.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.235
Sorry I missed it.
I just got back.

42:51.268 --> 42:53.104
-Was it--
-Perfect in every way.

42:53.137 --> 42:54.000
[laughs]

42:54.000 --> 42:54.238
[laughs]

42:54.271 --> 42:55.607
She‘s good, isn‘t she?

42:55.640 --> 42:57.508
She‘s something.

42:57.541 --> 43:00.000
You should come back.
The two of you together.

43:00.000 --> 43:00.278
You should come back.
The two of you together.

43:00.311 --> 43:02.447
Imagine you
on either side of me.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.215
Like a coxswain,
both oars in the water.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.000
Thanks.
I‘m good where I‘m at.

43:06.000 --> 43:06.884
Thanks.
I‘m good where I‘m at.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.920
Then know you have
hitched your wagon

43:08.953 --> 43:10.421
to Lord Mountbatten‘s boat.

43:10.454 --> 43:12.000
And that if you don‘t leave now,

43:12.000 --> 43:12.657
And that if you don‘t leave now,

43:12.690 --> 43:14.925
you will burn with him.

43:31.142 --> 43:32.510
You‘re the bear in the outhouse.

43:32.543 --> 43:35.446
I‘ve been called
some things, never that.

43:37.548 --> 43:39.017
You bought Winch.

43:39.050 --> 43:40.885
I brought it to you,
and you said no,

43:40.918 --> 43:42.000
and then you went
behind my back, bought it,

43:42.000 --> 43:42.320
and then you went
behind my back, bought it,

43:42.353 --> 43:43.988
and used it the opposite
way it was intended.

43:44.021 --> 43:45.556
Leon Sherald is
stepping down from The Combine,

43:45.589 --> 43:47.191
and Lauren was fired.

43:47.224 --> 43:48.000
And I only found out
about it all like that

43:48.000 --> 43:48.893
And I only found out
about it all like that

43:48.926 --> 43:50.495
woman in Alaska
in the outhouse did the bear:

43:50.528 --> 43:51.863
by getting bit on the ass.

43:51.896 --> 43:53.297
Prince said make Leon happy,

43:53.330 --> 43:54.000
but that wasn‘t going to work,

43:54.000 --> 43:54.532
but that wasn‘t going to work,

43:54.565 --> 43:56.167
so I made Leon irrelevant

43:56.200 --> 43:57.969
so he couldn‘t taint
any of our other investors.

43:58.002 --> 44:00.000
Yes, with your tech,
which works nicely in reverse.

44:00.000 --> 44:00.004
Yes, with your tech,
which works nicely in reverse.

44:00.037 --> 44:01.906
But I didn‘t go
behind anyone‘s back.

44:01.939 --> 44:05.510
So I missed an email where you
villain-monologued your plan?

44:05.543 --> 44:06.000
A move like this could have
blown up in both our faces.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.812
A move like this could have
blown up in both our faces.

44:07.845 --> 44:09.847
So instead I bought in secretly,
for both of us.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.282
You can check your books.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.000
And it will be
reflected in your bonus.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.084
And it will be
reflected in your bonus.

44:13.117 --> 44:14.485
But....

44:14.518 --> 44:16.454
I thought we were partners.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.000
What would make you think that?

44:18.000 --> 44:18.389
What would make you think that?

44:22.059 --> 44:24.000
I told you what this job
does to people.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.063
I told you what this job
does to people.

44:25.096 --> 44:27.698
Did you even start
this job as people?

44:36.440 --> 44:38.176
I‘d cut off my pinky
and give it to you

44:38.209 --> 44:40.645
in a handkerchief,
but we‘re not yakuza.

44:40.678 --> 44:41.813
So...

44:41.846 --> 44:42.000
I resign.

44:42.000 --> 44:42.946
I resign.

44:50.755 --> 44:53.257
-No.
-I agree.

44:53.290 --> 44:54.000
I won‘t have it,
and you can‘t do it.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.426
I won‘t have it,
and you can‘t do it.

44:55.459 --> 44:57.361
We knew this was war.

44:57.394 --> 44:59.063
If you go, it‘ll look
like I‘m taking a knee

44:59.096 --> 45:00.000
and admitting defeat,
and that can‘t happen.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.265
and admitting defeat,
and that can‘t happen.

45:01.298 --> 45:02.667
The question is,

45:02.700 --> 45:04.569
what are you going
to do about it now?

45:04.602 --> 45:06.000
There is no now.
We lost. This is defeat.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.371
There is no now.
We lost. This is defeat.

45:07.404 --> 45:09.840
And you don‘t know how
to come back from defeat?

45:13.677 --> 45:15.412
She‘s never lost before.

45:16.947 --> 45:18.000
-You‘ve never--
-Not like this.

45:18.000 --> 45:18.816
-You‘ve never--
-Not like this.

45:18.849 --> 45:20.351
Not really.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.352
How does it feel?

45:24.822 --> 45:26.390
Sick.

45:27.758 --> 45:29.093
Burning.

45:30.327 --> 45:32.129
Like I want to win.

45:33.430 --> 45:34.932
We can appeal, but the NYAG

45:34.965 --> 45:36.000
could drag this out
for months and years,

45:36.000 --> 45:36.701
could drag this out
for months and years,

45:36.734 --> 45:38.669
and we‘d miss the delivery
deadline on the Olympics.

45:42.339 --> 45:45.175
Calder said we had the support
of the unions and the state.

45:46.977 --> 45:48.000
We could try to get
an exception to the federal law.

45:48.000 --> 45:48.913
We could try to get
an exception to the federal law.

45:48.946 --> 45:50.381
Go above Chuck.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.917
She didn‘t mention
the governor?

45:52.950 --> 45:54.000
No.

45:54.000 --> 45:54.585
No.

45:54.618 --> 45:56.987
The state,
but not Sweeney specifically.

46:03.894 --> 46:05.896
[door opens]

46:07.164 --> 46:09.467
Ah, Michael Prince.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.435
Thank you for taking
the time to see--

46:13.637 --> 46:15.740
I was on the other side
of this move once.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.708
Sweeter to be on this one, no?

46:17.741 --> 46:18.000
Oh, it‘s great.
Lot of fun.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.210
Oh, it‘s great.
Lot of fun.

46:19.243 --> 46:21.145
I‘ll come back
when you‘re unencumbered.

46:21.178 --> 46:22.547
[Sweeney] Nonsense.

46:22.580 --> 46:23.815
Chuck is here to commiserate

46:23.848 --> 46:24.000
-with both of us.
-Yeah.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.750
-with both of us.
-Yeah.

46:25.783 --> 46:29.287
Losing those cars,
that was a, uh, was a blow.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.000
A lovely gift
for New York to have gotten.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.489
A lovely gift
for New York to have gotten.

46:31.522 --> 46:32.957
A shame.

46:32.990 --> 46:34.458
The only people standing
in the way of the buy

46:34.491 --> 46:35.960
are in this room.

46:35.993 --> 46:36.000
The three of us, right now,

46:36.000 --> 46:37.829
The three of us, right now,

46:37.862 --> 46:39.664
can do what‘s best
for the average New Yorker.

46:39.697 --> 46:41.666
No such thing as
the average New Yorker.

46:41.699 --> 46:42.000
If you were from here,
you‘d know that.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.301
If you were from here,
you‘d know that.

46:43.334 --> 46:46.871
But your generosity
won‘t be forgotten.

46:46.904 --> 46:48.000
There‘s no money
without the cars.

46:48.000 --> 46:48.539
There‘s no money
without the cars.

46:48.572 --> 46:51.042
Well, I am surprised
to hear you say that.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.677
I really am.

46:52.710 --> 46:54.000
And I gotta say,
a little disappointed.

46:54.000 --> 46:54.712
And I gotta say,
a little disappointed.

46:54.745 --> 46:56.948
It‘s not that you owe
the city the two billion.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.382
[chuckles]
Would that he did.

46:58.415 --> 47:00.000
No, but you did
promise it to the MTA.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.085
No, but you did
promise it to the MTA.

47:01.118 --> 47:02.753
You see, when you made
that promise,

47:02.786 --> 47:05.189
I made other promises.
I moved money around.

47:05.222 --> 47:06.000
I made phone calls,
took meetings.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.625
I made phone calls,
took meetings.

47:07.658 --> 47:10.328
I made assurances
to a lot people.

47:10.361 --> 47:12.000
Ohh, and you likely used
Mr. Prince‘s name a lot.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.965
Ohh, and you likely used
Mr. Prince‘s name a lot.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.933
Of course, ‘cause you know
in those situations,

47:15.966 --> 47:17.702
you want to give credit
where credit‘s due, right?

47:17.735 --> 47:18.000
And the newspapers?

47:18.000 --> 47:19.337
And the newspapers?

47:19.370 --> 47:21.672
They already have
the story of his largesse.

47:21.705 --> 47:24.000
Profiles are being written.

47:24.000 --> 47:24.609
Profiles are being written.

47:24.642 --> 47:26.611
A hagiographic haze.

47:26.644 --> 47:29.280
That is an awkward round
of corrections.

47:29.313 --> 47:30.000
[Sweeney] Yeah. So, you see
in that light, Mr. Prince,

47:30.000 --> 47:32.116
[Sweeney] Yeah. So, you see
in that light, Mr. Prince,

47:32.149 --> 47:33.985
I‘m a little
worried for you.

47:34.018 --> 47:36.000
If you‘re saying I‘ve got
to take those assurances back,

47:36.000 --> 47:36.354
If you‘re saying I‘ve got
to take those assurances back,

47:36.387 --> 47:38.189
well... [chuckles]

47:38.222 --> 47:39.590
...let‘s just say,
they bought both of us

47:39.623 --> 47:41.492
an enormous amount of good will.

47:41.525 --> 47:42.000
And it‘s the rare man
that can escape the perception

47:42.000 --> 47:44.095
And it‘s the rare man
that can escape the perception

47:44.128 --> 47:45.863
of a broken promise.

47:45.896 --> 47:47.832
Perhaps Michael Prince
is one of them.

47:47.865 --> 47:48.000
Though it does seem rather
risky for one who needs

47:48.000 --> 47:50.234
Though it does seem rather
risky for one who needs

47:50.267 --> 47:53.537
the entire infrastructure
of the state to support

47:53.570 --> 47:54.000
a New York City Olympic bid.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.973
a New York City Olympic bid.

48:03.914 --> 48:05.783
We‘ll make
an undirected donation

48:05.816 --> 48:06.000
of two billion dollars
to the MTA tomorrow morning.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.752
of two billion dollars
to the MTA tomorrow morning.

48:07.785 --> 48:09.320
Oof.

48:09.353 --> 48:10.855
In exchange for?

48:10.888 --> 48:12.000
Good will, and a player
to be named later.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.690
Good will, and a player
to be named later.

48:16.794 --> 48:18.000
Your nephew is an investment
that will pay off.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.530
Your nephew is an investment
that will pay off.

48:19.563 --> 48:21.432
He is.

48:21.465 --> 48:23.067
Undoubtedly.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.000
You and I can‘t stay
there forever.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.403
You and I can‘t stay
there forever.

48:25.436 --> 48:27.838
You know where we‘re headed.
You‘re the only one.

48:27.871 --> 48:30.000
But when we leave,

48:30.000 --> 48:30.241
But when we leave,

48:30.274 --> 48:32.343
to do the thing,

48:32.376 --> 48:35.746
we need to install someone
who‘ll run the place right.
