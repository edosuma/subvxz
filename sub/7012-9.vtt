00:05.605 --> 00:08.540
Well, here are my boys!
How was work?

00:08.608 --> 00:12.544
Oh, you know,just another day of restocking
upper Point Place with durable household goods.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.603
Sleep soundly,
Wisconsin.

00:16.116 --> 00:19.051
I got some big news
from the Price Mart home office.

00:19.119 --> 00:22.418
Ooh! They finally gonna let you
physically discipline the workers?

00:23.957 --> 00:27.984
- No, but I still have a free hand at home.
- Right.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.995
Headquarters is having
every manager...

00:30.063 --> 00:31.997
make a departmental
training film.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.260
And they picked me
for the stockroom.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.963
- Stockroom. Wow!
- Yeah!

00:39.305 --> 00:42.240
Steve from Oshkosh
got ice and snow management.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.299
( Chuckles )
Loser.

00:45.678 --> 00:47.612
Well, Red,
that is wonderful.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.614
Yeah, I know.

00:49.682 --> 00:54.551
Every single Price Mart stock boy
will be trained in the Red Forman way.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.748
Oh, you mean, undermining
their self-esteem...

00:56.823 --> 00:58.950
until they're too weak
to fight back?

00:59.025 --> 01:01.357
If you would just
zip it for a second...

01:01.428 --> 01:05.364
you might be interested in hearing
who I want to play the stock boy.

01:05.432 --> 01:08.128
Oh, look, Dad,
I appreciate the thought-

01:08.201 --> 01:10.601
I'm gonna use this idiot!

01:12.038 --> 01:14.472
- All right!

Man, I guess my movie career
is getting started sooner than I thought!

02:00.320 --> 02:02.254
Kelso's playing the stock boy?

02:02.322 --> 02:05.223
This is my
favorite thing ever.

02:08.561 --> 02:11.826
Well, Michael does have
marvelous bone structure.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.889
( Laughs )

02:13.967 --> 02:16.993
Oh, but you will too, honey,
once you fill out.

02:19.506 --> 02:22.703
Oh, man! Mom burn!

02:22.775 --> 02:26.711
Yep. That's twice
the normal burn.

02:26.779 --> 02:30.271
Dad, how can you choose Kelso
to play the Price Mart stock boy?

02:30.350 --> 02:32.443
You have a better suggestion?

02:37.323 --> 02:39.757
Hello!

02:39.826 --> 02:42.818
I <i>am</i>
a Price Mart stock boy.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.456
I just came
from stocking.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.966
At Price Mart.

02:48.034 --> 02:51.595
And I am currently wearing
a Price Mart stock boy smock.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.263
Good point, Eric.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.569
Give your smock to Kelso.

02:55.642 --> 02:59.942
Oh, I don't think my broad, photogenic
shoulders are gonna fit in that little thing.

03:01.281 --> 03:04.216
Now, don't take this
personal, Son.

03:04.284 --> 03:08.778
You're just too...
twitchy and skinny.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.916
Well, you know,
the camera adds 1 0 pounds.

03:13.927 --> 03:17.590
Yeah, 1 0.
Not 40.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.602
How could he pick Kelso
to play the stock boy?

03:23.670 --> 03:26.104
I'm the one with the
acting experience. Remember?

03:26.172 --> 03:29.005
I was Mushroom Number Two
in <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

03:30.243 --> 03:34.009
But you were
Mushroom Number One in my heart.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.840
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. What's up?

03:37.917 --> 03:40.351
- We're going to lunch.
- We're going to lunch?

03:40.420 --> 03:43.514
Well, actually, honey,
<i>we're</i> going to lunch.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.525
You and I
are going to lunch?

03:46.593 --> 03:48.754
Well, no.

03:48.828 --> 03:52.195
You and Donna and I
are going to lunch?

03:52.265 --> 03:54.529
Well, almost, honey.

03:54.601 --> 03:57.434
- You and Donna are going to lunch?

03:57.503 --> 03:59.630
Nothing gets past you,
Einstein.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.877
I don't think I like the idea of you two
going out to lunch together.

04:04.944 --> 04:08.072
Well, what if we bring
you back a sandwich?

04:08.147 --> 04:11.082
Well, a sandwich isn't gonna
make me feel better, Mom.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.744
Okay, then.
We're leaving.

04:15.154 --> 04:18.317
Well, in that case,
I would like a sandwich.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.321
Yeah,
I don't like this day.

Hey, Leo, man,
Huggy Bear called.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.642
He wants his suit back.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.978
Huggy Bear?

04:51.057 --> 04:53.287
This is <i>my</i> suit, man.

04:54.727 --> 04:57.719
So, to what do we owe
the fancy pants?

04:58.731 --> 05:00.665
Great news, man!

05:00.733 --> 05:04.134
I inherited a million bucks
from my dead uncle!

05:05.171 --> 05:07.639
- Shut up.
- No way.

05:07.707 --> 05:10.642
It's true! So, come on!
Let's share the wealth!

05:10.710 --> 05:13.235
Come on. I'll buy you
anything you want.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.248
Does that include burgers
and nudie mags?

05:16.316 --> 05:19.149
Include?
That's half the budget, man.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.663
Eric, have you seen Donna?

05:31.731 --> 05:35.064
She was supposed to help me sort out my
daytime cosmetics from my nighttime cosmetics...

05:35.134 --> 05:37.125
but she never showed up.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.538
Oh, you haven't heard?

05:40.606 --> 05:43.040
Donna's got a new friend...

05:43.109 --> 05:46.101
and I, for one,
think it's time you met her.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.785
Donna!
What are you doing?

05:57.056 --> 05:59.047
We invented
a new cookie.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.627
It's a variation
of the snickerdoodle.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.131
We're calling it
the ''DonnaKitty.''

06:09.802 --> 06:13.465
Or the ''Ditty.''
( Laughs )

06:13.539 --> 06:15.803
We haven't decided.

06:17.610 --> 06:22.070
Donna, you're supposed to be sorting-
as in, <i>my</i> cosmetics.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.874
Oh, yeah.
I'm real sorry I missed that.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.512
It started as an annoying,
but innocent lunch.

06:32.658 --> 06:35.252
And now they're
inventing cookies.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.387
It's growing, man.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.454
It's the freakin' Blob.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.839
Donna, why do you
need a new friend?

06:47.907 --> 06:49.841
Haven't I always
been there for you?

06:49.909 --> 06:51.968
Uh, no.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.410
I hope
your cookies burn!

06:58.751 --> 07:01.447
Eric, old people
and young people...

07:01.521 --> 07:04.456
are not supposed to
spend time together.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.515
It's unnatural.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.358
What am I
supposed to do about it?

07:10.430 --> 07:13.490
Well, you better
do something.

07:13.566 --> 07:16.501
You know what girls talk about
when they get together.

07:16.569 --> 07:20.437
Um, sugar and spice
and everything nice?

07:22.775 --> 07:26.438
That's what we're made of,
you dumb-ass.

07:31.350 --> 07:35.047
They talk about men,
and that would be you.

07:36.889 --> 07:38.880
Well, barely.

07:42.161 --> 07:46.154
You know, you could really use a refill
on the ''everything nice.''

07:50.436 --> 07:54.497
You know, I wasn't that worried
about Donna and my mom talking about me...

07:54.574 --> 07:56.906
but now
that I'm all paranoid...

07:56.976 --> 07:59.103
I'm all, like...

07:59.178 --> 08:01.112
paranoid.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.747
I mean, when did it become okay
for them to be friends?

08:05.818 --> 08:09.618
Right after your father replaced you
with a semi-literate pretty boy.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.891
That's me.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.623
So, I've been thinking about great actors
to model myself after...

08:17.697 --> 08:19.688
and I choose Travolta.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.037
Kelso...

08:26.105 --> 08:29.563
I can think of no better way
to impress Red...

08:29.642 --> 08:32.634
than by acting like Travolta
in his industrial film.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.477
Bravo, man.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.212
That is good advice.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.645
Man, I don't want Donna
and my mom talking about me.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.819
Yeah,
and Donna's a big mouth.

08:47.894 --> 08:52.354
Like, she told me how you wore makeup
to last year's class picture.

08:52.431 --> 08:54.592
What?

08:54.667 --> 08:56.931
I did not!
I did not.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.404
I had a zit.
Stop looking at me.

09:01.807 --> 09:06.176
Forman, you and I are both
victims of parental abandonment.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.577
Luckily, I have
a rich hippie benefactor.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.879
He bought me nudie mags
I'd never even heard of.

09:13.619 --> 09:17.214
( Imitating John Travolta )
Yeah, I'll stock this shelf!.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.953
But someday I'm gonna dance
across this whole city.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.786
That's dead-on.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.165
Okay, we need to talk.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.234
It's about, shall we say,
your new crowd.

09:41.413 --> 09:44.348
And don't even pretend you and Donna
aren't talking about me.

09:44.416 --> 09:48.409
I know what's going on here,
and it goes a little something like this-

09:53.759 --> 09:57.195
( Eric's Voice )
Oh, honey, you look wonderful.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.560
( Eric's Voice ) Say, can we look at Eric's
naked baby pictures again?

10:03.969 --> 10:05.960
They're right here!

10:08.207 --> 10:11.574
My, you could tell even then
he'd always be small.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.205
Yeah, he really is tiny.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.607
It's not satisfying.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.983
Well, how could it be, dear?

10:25.057 --> 10:28.026
But at least he's nice.

10:28.093 --> 10:30.027
Yeah, he's nice.

10:30.095 --> 10:32.859
For a nancy boy!
( Laughing )

10:37.937 --> 10:40.269
So, what do you say
to that?

10:41.907 --> 10:43.898
( Laughing )

10:50.616 --> 10:52.846
( Laughing Continues )

10:55.921 --> 11:00.654
All right, Kelso. You'll just go through
a few typical stock boy tasks...

11:00.726 --> 11:04.753
while I firmly, but kindly,
oversee you.

11:06.765 --> 11:09.290
- Got it.
- All right. Let's get started.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.442
Kelso...

11:20.512 --> 11:22.446
what the hell
are you doing?

11:22.514 --> 11:26.348
Oh, see, I'm going
for a Travolta thing.

11:27.553 --> 11:30.386
Okay, my character's
actually a dancer...

11:30.456 --> 11:33.448
who's just stocking shelves
until he makes it big.

11:37.496 --> 11:40.488
All right. Let me
paint a picture for you.

11:40.566 --> 11:42.557
Just close your eyes.

11:48.507 --> 11:51.408
Okay, imagine
with your eyes open.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.468
Just come with me.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.681
<i>( Women Singing Disco )</i>

12:17.336 --> 12:19.327
<i>( Ends )</i>

12:22.408 --> 12:25.866
Just stack the cans,
moron.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.748
But <i>why</i>
am I stacking cans?

12:31.817 --> 12:34.843
See, I'm thinking that
the manager is a bad guy.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.855
So, why would I
stack cans for him?

12:37.923 --> 12:41.086
Because if you don't
stack the cans...

12:41.160 --> 12:44.493
the manager
is going to kill you.

12:44.563 --> 12:48.397
Oh! So I'm afraid
for my life!

12:48.467 --> 12:51.368
That works.
All right. Let's act!

12:59.812 --> 13:02.542
Oh, no.
You're all alone.

13:02.614 --> 13:05.276
Where's your little buddy,
Skipper?

13:08.987 --> 13:11.922
Okay, sweetie.

13:11.990 --> 13:16.188
My friendship with Donna is making you
uncomfortable, so I'm gonna call it off.

13:17.863 --> 13:20.331
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:20.399 --> 13:23.197
Well, thank you.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.729
Maybe some of your loyalty
will rub off on Dad.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.269
Oh, don't let that
bother you.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.777
Michael may have
movie-star good looks...

13:33.846 --> 13:37.805
but you are much,
much smarter than he is.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.818
Okay, why couldn't you have
said that in front of everyone...

13:40.886 --> 13:43.980
instead of how great
Kelso's bone structure is?

13:45.090 --> 13:48.355
I don't want to
make anybody feel bad.

13:48.427 --> 13:50.759
Well, good job.

13:56.268 --> 13:58.532
All right, guys.
Let's shop!

14:22.461 --> 14:24.395
Thanks again, Leo.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.988
Yes, thank you.

14:27.065 --> 14:29.795
You know what would
make this outfit perfect?

14:29.868 --> 14:31.859
A cockatoo.

14:33.572 --> 14:35.506
Then we'll get a cockatoo.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.508
Or three!

14:47.019 --> 14:52.457
Hey, Red, listen, I've got this great new idea
I want to lay on you about our movie.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.893
Dad, I've heard this idea...

14:55.961 --> 14:59.055
and speaking as an unbiased observer
with no score to settle...

15:00.299 --> 15:02.164
it is great.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.168
Go!

15:04.236 --> 15:09.833
Kelso, you don't
get to have ideas.

15:09.908 --> 15:11.842
Dad, if I could
just interject.

15:11.910 --> 15:15.073
This idea will literally change
industrial filmdom forever.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.138
Go get 'em, Kelso!
Go!

15:19.885 --> 15:23.981
Okay. The stock boy
has a love interest.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.580
No.

15:25.657 --> 15:29.024
Now, before you say no,
I've already found the perfect person.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.358
Oh, stock boy,
I love you!

15:35.567 --> 15:37.728
No. Get out.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.774
Okay, um,
Eric's uncomfortable...

15:46.845 --> 15:50.076
because he thinks we talk about him-
which we don't.

15:52.050 --> 15:56.384
Although that story about him wearing
makeup to his class pictures was a hoot.

15:59.791 --> 16:02.726
But I guess
what I'm saying is, um...

16:02.794 --> 16:05.786
we probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

16:08.767 --> 16:12.396
But it's been so nice having someone
to talk to since my mom left.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.405
I know.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.668
Someone who understands
what I'm going through.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.267
Oh, honey.

16:19.344 --> 16:21.812
Someone to make
banana bread with.

16:23.248 --> 16:26.979
I ate that for dinner
three nights in a row.

16:27.052 --> 16:30.818
Oh, you poor, sweet girl.

16:32.391 --> 16:34.382
What the hell?

16:37.296 --> 16:39.730
( Squawk )

16:39.798 --> 16:42.289
Boy, being a millionaire
is great.

16:43.569 --> 16:46.800
Well, at least you put the money
to good use.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.773
Fun Tart?

16:49.841 --> 16:51.775
Don't mind if I do.

16:51.843 --> 16:53.811
Candy button?

16:53.879 --> 16:55.870
I've got
a million of them.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.117
So, Leo, man,
tell us about your Uncle Ed.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.710
Why'd he leave you
all his money?

17:02.788 --> 17:06.280
Check it out, man.
It's all in this letter he sent me.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.627
Your Uncle Ed is Ed McMahon?

17:12.564 --> 17:14.498
( Chuckles )
Yeah.

17:14.566 --> 17:17.433
Who knew
I was Scottish?

17:17.502 --> 17:19.492
Uh-oh.

17:20.771 --> 17:24.037
Damn, Leo, you didn't
inherit a million dollars.

17:24.108 --> 17:26.099
That's a sweepstakes contest.

17:27.445 --> 17:30.210
Well, then
who has my money?

17:30.282 --> 17:34.116
There is no money,
you son of a bitch!

17:36.488 --> 17:38.422
Oh.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.550
Wow. I guess all this stuff
has to go back.

17:41.627 --> 17:45.188
Oh, that means you too,
Feathery Frank.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.257
- Good day.
- But, Fez-

17:48.333 --> 17:50.563
I said, good day.

17:58.076 --> 18:01.204
( Imitating John Travolta )
I'm leaving Brooklyn, Mister Formanelli.

18:10.956 --> 18:14.949
And when I get to Manhattan,
I'm gonna be a star.

18:16.328 --> 18:18.319
So, what do you think?

18:19.698 --> 18:22.826
You're fired.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.760
You.

18:33.478 --> 18:36.970
<i>( Man Narrating ) Price Mart is only</i>
<i>as strong as its weakest stock boy.</i>

18:37.049 --> 18:41.452
<i>Just look at what one</i>
<i>well-trained worker can accomplish.</i>

18:44.656 --> 18:47.022
<i>Neat, efficient, organized.</i>

18:47.092 --> 18:49.424
<i>The Price Mart way.</i>

18:49.494 --> 18:54.022
<i>And each job completed with that</i>
<i>award-winning Price Mart attitude.</i>

19:00.672 --> 19:05.439
<i>Remember,you can't spell</i>
<i>stock boy without ''Oh, boy.!''</i>

19:08.146 --> 19:10.706
Perfect.

19:10.782 --> 19:13.717
Well, who would have thought
a stock boy would do a good job...

19:13.785 --> 19:16.379
playing a stock boy?

19:16.455 --> 19:19.515
Yeah, I mean,
it's a topsy-turvy world.

19:20.525 --> 19:23.722
Yeah.
You did a good job.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.422
Wait a minute.
Are you proud of me?

19:30.102 --> 19:33.594
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't say that.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.867
So...

19:35.941 --> 19:37.932
do we hug now?

19:39.010 --> 19:41.069
Men don't hug.

19:42.881 --> 19:45.247
My daddy loves me!

19:46.251 --> 19:49.778
- Shut it!
- I love you too, Daddy!

19:55.994 --> 19:58.588
Oh, well,
look who's here.

19:58.663 --> 20:01.564
Do a little shopping, ladies?

20:01.633 --> 20:04.568
Well, it's not like
I can take my dad shopping.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.571
I mean, every time the sales lady
brings over some underwear...

20:07.639 --> 20:10.574
he gets embarrassed
and goes, ''Whoo-hoo!''

20:12.043 --> 20:15.376
So, I suppose you have
something snarky to say about that.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.952
You know what?

20:22.020 --> 20:24.011
I don't.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.522
- Really?
- No.

20:28.593 --> 20:30.652
Look, your mom...

20:30.729 --> 20:32.924
can't take you shopping, so...

20:32.998 --> 20:35.762
it's cool with me
if you guys want to hang out.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.359
Honey, I am so glad
you understand.

20:38.436 --> 20:41.371
- Yeah, Eric, thanks.
- Yeah.

20:41.439 --> 20:43.270
Yeah,just, look, please...

20:43.341 --> 20:46.071
no talking about me, okay?

20:47.546 --> 20:51.482
And no looking at
my naked baby pictures either.

20:51.550 --> 20:54.542
They're... misleading.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.525
Honey, I've already
seen you naked.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.858
Mom.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.923
Oh, and she's
already seen you naked!

21:10.836 --> 21:13.771
You know what? From now on,
that's all we should talk about.

21:13.839 --> 21:16.672
Okay. Leaving now.

21:21.279 --> 21:23.213
Okay, here he is
on the potty.

21:23.281 --> 21:27.217
Look how hard
he's concentrating.

21:27.285 --> 21:30.277
Oh, I have
some earlier ones.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.224
Look at that baby.

21:34.292 --> 21:37.227
Didn't he have
the cutest little behind?

21:37.295 --> 21:38.728
Yeah!

21:38.797 --> 21:41.732
So when did he lose it?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.735
Right around
when he turned 1 0.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.737
It was the strangest thing.
Poof.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.739
Like someone ironed him.
