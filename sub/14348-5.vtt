00:06.339 --> 00:08.358
Hello.

00:08.393 --> 00:10.377
Hi.

00:11.878 --> 00:14.846
Janet?
How'd you get this number?

00:14.881 --> 00:17.133
Johnny did some
behind-the-scenes work.

00:17.168 --> 00:19.386
Hey, can I, uh-- Can
I talk to the kids?

00:19.421 --> 00:21.388
Yeah. Sure.

00:22.789 --> 00:25.291
Hey. It's Daddy.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.760
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, baby face.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.798
How's school? Are you
gonna come visit us again?

00:31.833 --> 00:34.265
I don't know, sweetheart.
I love you.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.738
Put, uh-- Put your brother on the
phone, please. Okay. I love you.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.975
Did you find my fire
helmet, Dad? I sure did, pal.

00:42.010 --> 00:43.942
Yup. I polished it up.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.211
Can you send it?
Yeah. Sure.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.481
- Hey, let me talk to Mom again, all right?
- Okay.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.483
I miss you.
I miss you too.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.919
Mom.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.923
Yeah? Where's Colleen? Is she there?

00:56.958 --> 00:58.758
She's here.
She just, uh--

00:59.025 --> 01:00.994
She doesn't want to talk.

01:01.029 --> 01:03.180
Oh. That's funny.

01:03.215 --> 01:05.296
Why is that funny?

01:05.331 --> 01:07.834
Hi, Mom.
How's it going?

01:11.838 --> 01:13.805
Six goddamn
days? Huh? Tommy--

01:13.840 --> 01:15.675
She's missing for almost a week
and you don't call her father?

01:16.176 --> 01:18.511
I was going to-- I'll
see you in court, bitch.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.853
- How'd I sound?
- You were pitch perfect.

01:28.855 --> 01:30.857
Hey. You get my,
uh, Viagra?

01:30.892 --> 01:33.860
Oh, yeah. Here.
Nice.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.031
My source could only get the longer-lasting
pill. Which longer-lasting one?

01:38.531 --> 01:41.801
Oh, shit. I don't remember. There's the
half-weekend one, the whole-weekend one.

01:41.836 --> 01:45.503
Oh, shit. It might be the whole
weekend. Jackpot. Thanks, bro.

01:45.538 --> 01:48.708
Hey, uh, brother, you didn't happen to see
anybody going through my locker, did you?

01:48.743 --> 01:50.675
No. Why?

01:50.710 --> 01:53.845
Uh, I don't know. I'm just
down a couple quarts, pill-wise.

01:53.880 --> 01:57.217
Yeah, no, I would have definitely
said something if I, you know--

01:57.252 --> 01:59.219
No, no, no. I know.
It's just, uh--

01:59.254 --> 02:01.186
Just what?

02:01.221 --> 02:03.021
- What was that?
- What?

02:03.056 --> 02:05.523
- That look.
- What look, Tommy?

02:05.558 --> 02:07.525
I can't believe that you
would even think that I--

02:07.560 --> 02:10.062
- Tommy, I'm just asking--
- How can you possibly think--

02:10.363 --> 02:13.233
- I'm not thinking-- - I know what
you're thinking. Okay? You know what?

02:13.268 --> 02:15.735
I don't even want
to think about it.

02:15.770 --> 02:18.238
Tom.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.085 --> 02:34.319
Shit.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.089
Son of a bitch.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.556
Drop something, Gavin?
Hey, Chief.

02:38.591 --> 02:41.059
I didn't know you were in there.
Sorry to interrupt.

02:41.094 --> 02:44.514
- What you taking there?
- It's just a cold-allergy pill.

02:44.549 --> 02:47.934
I have the sniffles.
- Cold-allergy thing?

02:47.969 --> 02:50.235
Yeah. Didn't look like it to me.

02:50.270 --> 02:52.570
Well, it's a big one.
Lasts all day.

02:52.605 --> 02:55.875
Let me see that, Gavin.
Gavin, get back here.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.016
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

03:05.051 --> 03:08.454
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

03:08.855 --> 03:11.589
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

03:11.624 --> 03:14.627
Things were good
when we were young

03:14.961 --> 03:18.131
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

03:18.166 --> 03:21.301
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

03:21.336 --> 03:24.769
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

03:24.804 --> 03:27.740
Things were good
when we were young

03:27.974 --> 03:30.942
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

03:30.977 --> 03:34.147
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

03:34.182 --> 03:37.584
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

03:37.619 --> 03:40.987
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

03:45.425 --> 03:48.828
Oh. Oh, yeah.

03:48.863 --> 03:50.830
Oh, yes.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.832
Yes, Tommy. Oh, yeah.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.101
Maybe we shouldn't
be doing this.

03:55.136 --> 03:56.836
Oh, grab my ass.
Okay.

03:57.337 --> 04:00.440
- Grab my ass, bitch!
- Okay. All right. If we could just keep it down.

04:00.475 --> 04:02.473
I can't help myself, Tommy.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.576
You and Mary Magdalene.
I knew it.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.846
- No, I can explain.
- Just like Judas.

04:06.881 --> 04:09.115
Oh!

04:12.619 --> 04:14.621
Another nightmare?
Yeah.

04:14.656 --> 04:17.088
- Dad?
- Hey.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.089
Wh-- Where you going?

04:19.125 --> 04:21.826
I'm gonna go to school.
What school?

04:21.861 --> 04:23.863
My old one. I'm gonna go hang
out and wait for my friends,

04:23.898 --> 04:25.163
and we're all going
to Jen's house.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.366
I'll be over there
the next two nights. Okay?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.719
Wait a minute. Wait--
What about, you know,

04:29.754 --> 04:32.003
if I had some stuff
planned for us to do?

04:32.038 --> 04:35.041
What stuff? Well, I was
planning on, you know,

04:35.076 --> 04:38.009
making some...
plans on some stuff...

04:38.044 --> 04:41.679
that we could, uh, you
know, do together. Bye-bye.

04:41.714 --> 04:44.050
Hey, whoa. You can't just waltz on
out of here without my permission.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.319
You look like you're going
to a wet T-shirt contest.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.019
Now you sound
just like Mom.

04:48.054 --> 04:51.440
You know what? Get back inside and
put on a decent shirt. Right now.

04:51.475 --> 04:54.827
You know, I might just grab my
bag and head back out on the road.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.562
How would you
like that, Daddy? Hmm?

04:56.963 --> 04:58.998
I bet that would help your
case against Mom, wouldn't it?

05:07.106 --> 05:09.040
Hey, baby.
Well, this is a nice surprise.

05:09.075 --> 05:12.078
- How's my favorite health-care
provider? - I'll be better when I see you.

05:12.578 --> 05:14.379
Oh, yeah?
That's what I was calling about.

05:14.414 --> 05:17.250
You wanna get together tonight? Maybe
grab some dinner, fool around after?

05:17.285 --> 05:20.718
Don't really need the dinner
part. Oh, you bad girl.

05:20.753 --> 05:23.756
Hey, listen, do me a favor. Bring me a
couple more bottles of that Vicodin, huh?

05:23.791 --> 05:25.723
I just gave you
two bottles.

05:25.758 --> 05:28.094
Yeah. I, uh--
I lost one of them.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.228
Somebody took it.

05:30.263 --> 05:33.599
Are you sure
you didn't take it?

05:33.966 --> 05:36.202
I'm giving you that stuff for pain,
Frank, not so you can get hooked.

05:36.237 --> 05:39.272
Hey, look, I'm not hooked on
anything, okay? Except your ass.

05:39.307 --> 05:41.572
Likewise.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.408
Well, how's 7:00 sound?

05:43.443 --> 05:45.778
Yeah, 7:00 sounds great. And,
uh, bring me a present, okay?

05:45.813 --> 05:48.298
I'll bring you
a couple presents.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.748
Bye, baby.
Who you talking to?

05:50.783 --> 05:54.287
Oh, uh, Keela. She's learning
to use the phone. It's cute.

05:54.322 --> 05:56.289
Oh, I bet.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.294
Look, I'm not some sort
of awful, jealous hag,

06:01.329 --> 06:03.261
but if you turn me into one,

06:03.296 --> 06:06.299
I promise I'll beyour
awful, jealous hag...

06:06.334 --> 06:08.134
for the rest of your life.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.874
- Yeah, it's Mick.
- Is this Father Michael Gavin?

06:16.909 --> 06:20.313
- Yes, it is. Who's calling?
- Chief Ron Perolli, F.D.N.Y.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.916
I'm in charge of your cousin
Tom Gavin. How you doing, Chief?

06:24.183 --> 06:26.617
So you over the fat chick?
Totally.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.155
Yeah? What's with the new girl?
What's her name? Uh, Allison.

06:29.190 --> 06:31.174
Can I tell you something, bro?
Sure.

06:31.209 --> 06:33.159
Concerning Allison?
Yeah, go ahead.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.127
- She's gigantic.
- No, she's tall.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.664
No. No. Shaq is tall, okay?
Yo-yo Ming is tall.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.131
- Yao Ming.
- Yo.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.668
- Yao. - No, I was just--
I was just saying hi.

06:43.035 --> 06:45.505
- Your chick is gigantic.
- Oh, he's back with the fat chick?

06:45.540 --> 06:47.638
- No, he's dating a vet now.
- What war?

06:47.673 --> 06:50.176
- No, a vet, like cats and dogs.
- And she's fat?

06:50.211 --> 06:51.642
- Tall.
- How tall are we talking?

06:51.677 --> 06:54.514
Oh, like, not that tall.
Like, 6'2", 6'3" and a half.

06:55.014 --> 06:57.600
So are you only doing Guinness
Book chicks now? Is that it, Probie?

06:57.635 --> 07:00.186
Fattest and Tallest? I mean, what's
next, a chick with three tits?

07:00.686 --> 07:03.689
That'd be great, wouldn't it? You know, I
dated a chick with three nipples one time.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.192
Well, I thought it was a nipple.
It turned out to be a boil.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.030
Anyway, an extra tit
would be great.

07:11.531 --> 07:15.166
-Yeah. So she's tall. It's no big deal.
- What's the attraction?

07:15.201 --> 07:17.537
You know, first I was a little freaked
out, and then I started thinking.

07:17.572 --> 07:19.504
It's nice not to have to--

07:19.539 --> 07:22.542
You know, I can't really
explain it. No, go ahead.

07:22.577 --> 07:25.312
- It's gonna sound weird.
- No, come on. Tell us.

07:25.347 --> 07:28.047
Well, you know, usually
the guy's the tall one.

07:28.082 --> 07:30.049
You're bigger. You're in charge.

07:30.084 --> 07:32.517
But with Allison, it's--

07:32.552 --> 07:36.556
It's nice not to have
to be the man all the time.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.857
That didn't come out right.

07:39.892 --> 07:42.561
What, you're saying you
like being the girl? No.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.196
- I think that's what you said.
- You little freak.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.733
No, that's not what I meant. You
know what I was trying to say, Frank.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.700
You're amazing, Mike.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.737
Only you could turn a relationship
with a woman into a gay experience.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.590
Keep up
the good work, buddy.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.408
What's going on?
Nothin'.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.410
Miss anything?
No.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.663
- Yeah?
- Hey. It's me.

08:00.698 --> 08:03.381
Get out of here.
What's up?

08:03.416 --> 08:06.384
Listen. Your Chief
Perolli called me. What?

08:06.419 --> 08:08.254
Wants me to check in with him.
Make sure you're staying sober.

08:08.289 --> 08:10.089
Holy shit. That asshole
can't wait to get rid of me.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.508
He is just waiting for you
to screw up, Tom.

08:12.543 --> 08:14.527
And, you know, if he's got
the balls to call me,

08:14.562 --> 08:16.529
you know he's got
other guys watching you--

08:16.796 --> 08:18.764
Watching your every move,
reporting back to him.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.565
Yeah, right. Probably.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.936
I wouldn't put it past this prick to
have guys following you into the meetings.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.904
Shit.
Yeah, shit.

08:26.939 --> 08:30.609
So I suggest we start hitting
as many meetings as possible.

08:30.644 --> 08:34.280
- Yeah, yeah. That'd be a--
That's be a great cover. - Yup.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.951
Do you need a hand?

08:43.956 --> 08:45.791
I thought maybe we could
act like adults.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.134
I didn't want to file
a grievance, Lou.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.139
I asked you to apologize--
Twice.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.476
I'm not afraid of you, Lou.

09:14.086 --> 09:15.988
I think you should just let
the legal system run its course.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.823
That's not gonna work.
You heard Cousin Eddie.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.291
You know? They'll side with the mother.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.912
I'm gonna throw good money after
bad and she'll end up with the kids.

09:22.947 --> 09:25.498
- No. Forget it.
- You got better odds with a runaway kid on one hand,

09:25.533 --> 09:27.517
and proof that the mother
didn't call on the other...

09:27.552 --> 09:29.502
than you do with two kids
that you kidnapped back.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.270
It's crazy, Tommy. I'll
just say they ran away too.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.773
And-And what happens when these
kids have to testify in court?

09:34.273 --> 09:36.225
Hey, you'd be surprised
what a couple of new bikes...

09:36.260 --> 09:38.142
and a freezer full of
Chunky Monkey can do, pal.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.446
I will not be involved in this
plan, and I wasn't even here.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.748
Excuse me.
I was looking for Tommy Gavin.

09:43.783 --> 09:48.020
I'm him. I'm Liam Murphy.
I was here the other day.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.855
Oh, yeah.
The guys told me. Yeah.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.525
- I don't mean to interrupt or
anything-- - I was praying someone would.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.826
I'm Johnny Gavin. I'm his
brother. My cross to bear. Sorry.

09:55.861 --> 09:59.198
- Actually, I guess I want to speak with you too.
- About what?

09:59.233 --> 10:01.499
Uh, I don't know
how to say this.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.370
I don't really want to be
disruptive or embarrass you,

10:04.737 --> 10:07.171
but, uh--

10:07.206 --> 10:09.709
Well, it appears
that you two are my brothers.

10:12.545 --> 10:16.549
You mean brothers in Christ? 'Cause we
stopped going to church a long time ago.

10:16.584 --> 10:19.051
Long time.
Yeah. So--

10:19.285 --> 10:22.888
No, I mean your brother--
Or half-brother, I suppose.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.724
Here. Uh--

10:25.224 --> 10:27.726
We share the same father--
Michael Gavin.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.229
What's this, like a--
What do they call it?

10:30.264 --> 10:31.998
A Photoshop thing?
Yeah. Photoshop.

10:32.264 --> 10:35.334
You had me for a second.
Who set this up? Lou? Jerry?

10:35.369 --> 10:38.369
I think the priest thing is
a little bit obvious, but--

10:38.404 --> 10:41.741
The fact of it is, your father
had an affair with my mother.

10:41.776 --> 10:43.708
Lasted over 30 years.

10:43.743 --> 10:47.747
In fact, I, uh, also have a picture
of the two of them... together.

10:47.782 --> 10:50.082
Sweet chocolate Christ.
That's Dad.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.917
What an asshole.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.719
Son of a bitch. Sorry
about the language, Father.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.589
No, that's all right. You can throw
in "shithead" while you're at it.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.427
Welcome to the family.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.696
Father.

11:05.231 --> 11:08.267
A priest, huh?
You know, I had no idea.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.668
Funny thing, Dad.
Neither did we.

11:10.703 --> 11:12.670
Are you out of your mind?
Huh? Did Mom know?

11:12.705 --> 11:14.607
If your mother knew, we wouldn't
be having this conversation,

11:15.107 --> 11:18.611
because I'd be dead in some river
somewhere with my balls in my mouth.

11:18.646 --> 11:21.781
- "Did Mom know?"
-The guy's almost the same age as me, right?

11:22.281 --> 11:24.784
He's a couple weeks younger. I mean,
how long were you seeing this broad?

11:24.819 --> 11:27.386
Oh, about... 36 years.

11:27.421 --> 11:29.622
What?

11:29.855 --> 11:32.523
You were having an affair for
36 years? What can I tell you?

11:32.558 --> 11:36.228
- When it comes to adultery, I'm a
one-woman man. - You still seeing this broad?

11:36.263 --> 11:38.929
No, no. God, no.
It's been over for 10 years.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.801
What happened? Well, she got
too clingy, and I hate that.

11:41.836 --> 11:44.804
And-And we had
a great arrangement.

11:45.304 --> 11:48.307
You know, I'd, uh, see
her once or twice a month.

11:48.342 --> 11:51.310
I gave her some money.
Well, hold on a second.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.979
You telling me that all those
years we were scraping by--

11:54.346 --> 11:56.781
those years that we didn't
have family vacations,

11:56.816 --> 11:58.818
that year that you got me that
stupid sled for Christmas--

11:58.853 --> 12:00.785
that you were supporting
another family?

12:00.820 --> 12:04.323
-Now, look-- -Are you talking about
that sled with the really cool brakes?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.493
- Goddamn brakes never worked.
- Wait a minute. You told me that was my goddamn sled,

12:07.528 --> 12:09.512
and that he'd been bad and
Santa brought him a lump of coal,

12:09.547 --> 12:11.497
so I should let him play with
it and pretend it was his.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.332
Count your blessings--

12:13.833 --> 12:16.085
Because one year when
I was a kid, Oh, God.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.337
my sisters each got
a big box of tampons.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.639
And they were happy to get--
Don't start with the tampon speech.

12:21.674 --> 12:25.010
Yeah. At first they were fit to be
tied, but as the months wore on--

12:25.045 --> 12:26.846
Blah, blah, blah.
It was true, goddamn it.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.980
Nobody cares.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.017
Water under the bridge.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.485
Now, look.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.987
I don't want Mrs. Ng to know,

12:37.022 --> 12:39.356
because she thinks I have
enough kids as it is.

12:39.391 --> 12:42.862
- And so mum's the word.
- Yeah. Mum. Forget about her spinning in her grave.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.799
She's probably up and out of it, on her
way over here right now, as we speak.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.266
Aw, Jesus, Dad.
Why?

12:49.301 --> 12:51.637
Let's hear what kind of trumped-up,
half-baked justification...

12:51.672 --> 12:53.873
you can pull out
of your ass this time.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.607
I needed sex.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.644
Oh, my God. Your
mother was brought up...

12:59.111 --> 13:01.647
in a strict Roman Catholic
household.

13:01.682 --> 13:04.650
Sex was for procreation only.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.986
It was easier for me
to get another broad.

13:07.021 --> 13:09.954
That's it?
Yeah.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.558
Is there anything else you want to
tell us about? Nope. Just the priest.

13:12.593 --> 13:15.227
Great. Thank God for that.
Let's get out of here, Tommy.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.062
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.297
- He has a sister.
- What?

13:20.332 --> 13:23.335
Are you talking about, like,
a "sister" sister, like a nun?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.337
No, no, no, no.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.840
She was working at a Dairy
Queen the last time I saw her.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.076
Didn't both of our other sisters work
in fast food at one time or another?

13:31.111 --> 13:33.179
- Apparently it's genetic.
- Now, don't hate me, fellas.

13:33.679 --> 13:36.131
I was young and weak,
and this girl--

13:36.166 --> 13:38.584
the mother of these
two kids-- Yeah?

13:38.951 --> 13:41.921
She had an ass that
you could see the future in.

13:41.956 --> 13:43.387
That's it. I'm going.
That's great.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.257
You didn't happen to stick
your head up far enough...

13:45.758 --> 13:47.760
to see that the Yankees were gonna lose
four in a row to the Red Sox, did you?

13:47.795 --> 13:50.262
No. Didn't think so.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.200
Would have made
a lot of money if I did.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.438
Well, we're here.
Where?

13:59.473 --> 14:01.405
Prepare to feast your eyes.

14:01.440 --> 14:05.444
Hey, listen.
If this is your usual bullshit--

14:08.948 --> 14:10.915
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.953
Keep your hands off me. You can tell me
to come here without hands, all right?

14:13.988 --> 14:16.288
Look and be amazed.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.023
Holy shit.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.025
Tell me about it.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.962
Well, what do you think?

14:24.864 --> 14:27.900
You gotta get me a meeting
with your agent.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.055
Jeannie?

14:33.090 --> 14:35.307
It's me.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.812
Babe?

14:47.820 --> 14:49.655
Jeannie.

14:53.425 --> 14:57.895
Oh, I know.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.932
Jesus Christ!
Bud, what are you doing here?

15:00.432 --> 15:01.934
Who is this guy?
It's my brother, Bud.

15:02.434 --> 15:05.437
A little privacy here, huh?
That's my wife, you son of a bitch.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.440
She never told me she was married.
No, no! Stop! Don't! Don't!

15:10.943 --> 15:13.445
Don't hurt him. Don't!

15:13.946 --> 15:15.447
I didn't know.

15:15.948 --> 15:17.950
Leave him alone!
I didn't know!

15:19.952 --> 15:21.919
You son of a bitch, you.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.957
I catch you near my wife again,
I'll kill you!

15:30.462 --> 15:32.464
Goddamn it, Jeannie.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.467
Goddamn it.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.972
He was sweet to me.

15:42.474 --> 15:44.476
He told me I was pretty.

15:46.478 --> 15:49.481
Don't ruin things, Bud.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.895
Let's go
into the bedroom.

16:04.229 --> 16:06.732
Oh, uh, you know,
my daughter's in there sleeping.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.736
Are you expecting someone?
No. No, no, no.

16:11.236 --> 16:12.738
Must just be, like,
a take-out delivery guy...

16:13.238 --> 16:15.240
ringing the wrong apartment.
Mmm.

16:19.745 --> 16:23.082
Uh, one second.
Mmm.

16:27.419 --> 16:29.922
- Yeah.
- It's me. Can I come up?

16:32.925 --> 16:34.892
Hi. What are you doing?

16:34.927 --> 16:38.597
I'm shopping, and I got some of that
natural peanut butter that Keela likes.

16:39.098 --> 16:42.101
-Open up.
- All right. I'll be right down.

16:42.136 --> 16:44.103
What?

16:44.603 --> 16:48.107
Uh, that's my sister.
Consuelo.

16:53.112 --> 16:55.614
Hey, sweetheart.

16:56.115 --> 16:59.583
This is a nice surprise.
Yeah. You look surprised.

16:59.618 --> 17:03.087
Yeah. I-I just, you know-- Keela,
she's coming down with something,

17:03.122 --> 17:06.959
and I thought that if both of us caught
it, it might look a little suspicious.

17:08.794 --> 17:11.261
This issonot working.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.763
Good-bye.
Uh, Laura. Laura, what--

17:13.799 --> 17:17.051
What's the matter? You totally
have somebody up there, don't you?

17:17.087 --> 17:20.270
You wouldn't buzz me up, and then
you came all the way down here.

17:20.305 --> 17:24.643
No, no, no. I told you-- Oh, dude,
you are a great lay and a shit liar.

17:24.678 --> 17:26.944
So why don't you take your
peanut butter...

17:26.979 --> 17:28.480
and spread it all over
whoever you have up there...

17:28.981 --> 17:30.749
and have yourself
a wonderful evening.

17:30.784 --> 17:33.951
Hey, Laura. Laura.
Listen.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.953
Sweetheart, what you and I
have got--

17:35.988 --> 17:38.323
It's not like anything I've
had with anybody else before.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.593
Okay?
I-I'm not saying it's love--

17:40.628 --> 17:42.828
Of course not.
But, God, it could be.

17:43.328 --> 17:46.832
And, God, I want it to be.
I really do.

17:46.867 --> 17:48.834
But I wanna be ready, you know?

17:48.869 --> 17:50.801
I want it to be smooth.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.338
So, yeah, maybe I have to tie up
some of the loose ends in my life,

17:53.839 --> 17:56.842
but I swear to you, girl, there's
nobody upstairs but me and my daughter.

17:56.877 --> 17:59.529
I mean, if we don't have trust,
Laura, we don't have anything.

17:59.564 --> 18:02.181
So you still don't believe me,
you still think I'm lying to you,

18:02.216 --> 18:04.016
that I'm hiding
some chick upstairs--

18:04.516 --> 18:06.518
By all means,
be my guest.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.930
What?

18:19.965 --> 18:22.968
You're really...
important to me you know,

18:23.003 --> 18:25.436
and I never meant
for this to happen,

18:25.471 --> 18:28.974
but now that it is happening,
it makes me scared...

18:29.009 --> 18:31.477
and jealous and stupid.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.981
I gotta go.

18:37.983 --> 18:40.951
Hey, hey.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

18:40.986 --> 18:42.953
Hi. This is the home
of Peter and Stephen.

18:42.988 --> 18:45.891
Leave a message and we'll
call you back. Thanks.

18:45.926 --> 18:47.858
Hey, uh, Pete.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.395
This is your old man.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.362
She's, uh--

18:52.397 --> 18:55.367
Well, I was gonna say she's--
She's better, but she's--

18:55.834 --> 18:57.836
She's bad.
She's real bad.

18:59.838 --> 19:03.342
Look, I know things haven't
been good between the two of us.

19:04.843 --> 19:06.845
It's mostly my fault.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.847
Uh-- But, uh--

19:10.849 --> 19:13.602
I need you to come home.

19:13.637 --> 19:16.497
I need your help, kid.

19:16.532 --> 19:19.358
I can't do this anymore.

19:19.393 --> 19:21.325
Please.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.862
Just call me, huh?
Please?

19:32.271 --> 19:34.106
That's it. That's
definitely the way to go.

19:34.606 --> 19:37.609
- I'm gonna kidnap my own kids back.
- I'm not hearing this, Tommy.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.576
Especially after what
we just went through.

19:39.611 --> 19:42.614
You know, your lips-- They're moving,
but there's no sound coming out.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.384
Think about how I would feel
if I didn't do this.

19:45.419 --> 19:48.120
You know? Think about
the-- The goddamn sled.

19:48.155 --> 19:50.139
That's it. You know what? I'm leaving.

19:50.174 --> 19:52.089
You're an asshole. Good-bye. What?

19:52.124 --> 19:54.591
You know, Tommy,
before you do anything--

19:54.626 --> 19:57.129
and not that I would know
what that "anything" would be--

19:57.629 --> 20:00.632
you gotta do something completely
foreign now, Tommy. You gotta think.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.385
We just found out
that our father had been...

20:03.420 --> 20:05.602
banging some strange broad
for 30-plus years,

20:05.637 --> 20:10.642
and now we got a priest brother, and we
got a former D.Q. employee for a sister,

20:10.677 --> 20:12.644
both floating around
the city somewhere.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.612
And now our old man--
our father--

20:15.647 --> 20:18.650
is living on Park Avenue,
banging Yoko Ono's grandmother.

20:19.151 --> 20:22.154
Not to mention the whole
you-knocking-up-our- dead-cousin's-wife thing.

20:22.189 --> 20:25.122
This is our family
in a nutshell.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.159
Do you really want to bring
your kids back into this?

20:27.194 --> 20:29.626
Huh? Do you?

20:29.661 --> 20:31.663
You gotta think. Huh?

20:32.164 --> 20:33.665
Think.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.671
Gee.

20:46.511 --> 20:49.479
God, I am just so upset. I
mean, it's not even my apartment.

20:49.514 --> 20:53.352
My friend's out of town and I was
watching it for her. She's gonna kill me.

20:53.387 --> 20:56.706
Yeah, accidents happen. At least
there wasn't that much damage--

20:56.741 --> 21:00.134
Except for the smoke. You guys
are being so nice. Thank you.

21:00.169 --> 21:03.528
I'm Heather. Yeah, I'm Sean,
by the way. This is Franco.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.364
Nice to meet you.
You're both so strong.

21:05.399 --> 21:07.633
Well, you know,
I work out a lot.

21:07.668 --> 21:09.833
Yeah. Well, me too--
A lot, you know.

21:09.868 --> 21:13.337
I mean, like, I gotta get a
life. I work out that much.

21:13.372 --> 21:16.375
Uh, Miss, you in the habit of
burning candles during the day?

21:16.410 --> 21:19.145
Yeah. I'm a Buddhist--
Well, at least I'm trying to be.

21:19.180 --> 21:21.880
They caught the curtains
over the sink and I panicked.

21:21.915 --> 21:24.383
Panicked Buddhist-- We
don't get a lot of those.

21:24.418 --> 21:26.850
Franco, ready to start
packing this in?

21:26.885 --> 21:30.222
Yeah. Hey, uh, Garrity, why
don't you start packing up?

21:30.257 --> 21:32.908
Yeah, well, why don't you
pack up? Why don't you?

21:32.943 --> 21:35.560
Because I'm busy.
I'm-- I'm comforting Heather.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.527
Oh, how sweet.

21:37.562 --> 21:40.815
I can comfort her. Yeah, I
know, but that's, you know--

21:40.850 --> 21:44.069
- Hey, Frank. Laura needs you upstairs.
- Yeah? What for?

21:44.104 --> 21:46.036
I don't know. She was
looking out the window.

21:46.071 --> 21:49.574
- She told me to tell you to get up there.
- Uh, what window?

21:49.609 --> 21:52.244
- Right there.
- Yeah.

21:52.744 --> 21:55.580
Well, I'm gonna start packing
up. All right. See you later.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.881
You guys are all so brave.
Yeah?

21:57.916 --> 22:01.920
- I don't know how to thank you.
- God, please. Give me a second. I'll think of something.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.094
Hey, is that new?

22:10.362 --> 22:13.198
What are you looking at? Ladies
only. Go ahead, fruitcake.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.101
Hey. Well, hello.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.606
That really you up there?

22:21.973 --> 22:23.907
Why, yes, it is.

22:23.942 --> 22:26.278
You look much smaller
in person.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.880
Yeah, well, I've been
working out.

22:29.147 --> 22:32.916
Hi. Uh, my name is, uh, Fred,
and I'm an alcoholic.

22:32.951 --> 22:36.753
Hi, Fred. Last night
I was with my brother,

22:36.788 --> 22:41.293
and we felt like having a drink,
but instead we got some coffee,

22:41.328 --> 22:43.760
and, uh--

22:43.795 --> 22:45.797
Well, long story short.
Blah, blah, blah.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.799
Didn't drink, and, uh--

22:49.301 --> 22:51.803
One day at a time.
See you.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.475
Thanks, Fred.
See any suspicious faces?

22:57.510 --> 23:00.245
Just about the whole
goddamn room. Really?

23:00.545 --> 23:03.081
- Excuse me, Fred.
- Hi.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.817
I saw you at a meeting. I thought
you were Tommy the fireman.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.617
You said you were Bob
the plumber.

23:07.652 --> 23:09.619
- You're a plumber?
- No. No. It's my--

23:09.654 --> 23:12.924
That's my twin brother.
Addiction is genetic.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.624
He's a priest
and a plumber.

23:14.659 --> 23:15.994
Alcoholic.
Hi, Paul.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.331
- I'm a brain surgery... guy.
- You're a brain surgeon?

23:19.366 --> 23:21.666
Uh, yeah.
Let's switch seats.

23:29.674 --> 23:32.476
Yeah.
I been here, like, 15 minutes.

23:32.511 --> 23:35.479
Now, is that normal?
Yeah. Uh, that's nothin'.

23:35.514 --> 23:39.518
- You all right?
- Yeah. I jammed my finger in the door. It's killing me.

23:39.553 --> 23:42.687
- What'll I do when I get in there?
- Just be yourself.

23:42.722 --> 23:46.525
Oh, my God.
I gotta go, pal.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.861
Mr. Quinn
will see you now.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.633
Oh, it's so good
to see you, uh-- uh--

23:54.900 --> 23:56.600
Mr. Quinn.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.503
You know, Teddy and I
are old friends.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.372
He's my brother,
so why shouldn't we be?

24:00.872 --> 24:02.339
And he, uh--
Thank you.

24:02.374 --> 24:06.211
- No, thank you. As I was saying--
- No, no, no, no. Thank you.

24:06.246 --> 24:09.214
Sir, you can come with
me. W-Wait a minute. I--

24:15.387 --> 24:17.722
That was unbelievable.

24:18.089 --> 24:19.856
I'm sure it was.

24:19.891 --> 24:23.394
No. You're the best... ever.
I-- I mean it.

24:23.429 --> 24:26.898
- I know.
- You want to get a cup of coffee?

24:26.933 --> 24:30.569
No. That'll be 100 bucks.

24:30.604 --> 24:33.004
I'm sorry?

24:35.507 --> 24:38.375
$100. Now.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.245
Sure. Sure. Uh--

24:41.746 --> 24:44.583
Yeah. Uh, I didn't
catch your name, sweetheart.

24:44.618 --> 24:46.751
Frank.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.524
So, not one suspicious face
in the whole crowd?

24:52.559 --> 24:54.491
You spoke for what--
Like, 12 seconds.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.528
I mean, I barely had time to check
out the guy's shoes in front of me.

24:57.028 --> 24:59.030
I mean, come on, Tom.
What are you doing here?

24:59.498 --> 25:02.534
What do you mean? It's not about how
many meetings you go to, all right?

25:02.569 --> 25:04.369
It's about the message.
I know.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.204
You know?
Yeah.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.539
What's the message?
The message?

25:08.039 --> 25:10.041
Yeah.
It's... don't drink.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.043
And?
I'm not drinking.

25:12.477 --> 25:14.446
Yeah, because you got the pressure
on you of losing your spot...

25:14.481 --> 25:17.449
in a very active house
with all your old pals.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.652
Because you know Janet's gonna bring
your drinking up if you go to court.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.455
What about after that, huh? What about
next year and the year after that?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.188
When you start
running out of reasons to come.

25:25.223 --> 25:28.627
What about when you start running
out of fake names, for Christ's sake?

25:28.662 --> 25:30.462
What then, huh?

25:31.963 --> 25:35.467
One day at a time, brother.
One day at a time.

25:35.502 --> 25:37.302
Great.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.639
See ya.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.909
Bullshit. How can the guy
say that he's not interested...

25:43.944 --> 25:46.411
when I was in his office
all of two seconds?

25:46.845 --> 25:49.314
That's how the business works.
He said he didn't respond to you.

25:49.349 --> 25:51.583
Just accept it
and move on.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.818
What did he say specifically?

25:54.185 --> 25:57.155
Aw, God. He said you
were too old and fat.

25:57.656 --> 26:01.426
You know, I feel shitty about
this. I tell you, I really do.

26:01.461 --> 26:03.662
Join the club. I had a
broad blow me yesterday.

26:03.697 --> 26:06.348
Thought it was
'cause of the billboard.

26:06.383 --> 26:09.000
Ends up she's a whore.
Asked me for money.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.269
Worst part is, I'm
pretty sure she was a guy.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.271
A really good-looking guy.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.187
Hey.

26:29.554 --> 26:31.790
I'm glad you could
make it down.

26:31.825 --> 26:33.990
Hi.
Hi.

26:34.025 --> 26:37.028
- How long can you stay?
- Had some time coming.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.531
Couple of weeks.
My chief's a good guy.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.533
Good. Great.
Well, I gotta scoot.

26:42.568 --> 26:45.303
I'm working tonight too.
How is she?

26:46.705 --> 26:49.207
Well, you might find it
a little bit rough.

26:49.242 --> 26:51.007
She goes in and out.

26:51.042 --> 26:53.878
She's better in the early part
of the day.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.845
She's up taking a nap now,
and, uh,

26:55.880 --> 26:57.847
you never know
what to expect, you know?

26:57.882 --> 27:02.352
It's that bad? Why
didn't you tell me before?

27:02.387 --> 27:04.973
Call me? I've had my hands
full around here, goddamn it.

27:05.008 --> 27:07.524
It's not like I have time
to phone up and just chat.

27:07.559 --> 27:10.395
She's wandering off. She gets
lost. She leaves the stove on.

27:10.430 --> 27:13.898
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

27:14.399 --> 27:16.366
Well, she'll be up
in a little bit.

27:16.401 --> 27:18.670
We'll talk tomorrow, huh?
We'll make a plan.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.740
Okay.
Peter!

27:21.973 --> 27:23.508
Oh!

27:24.009 --> 27:26.011
What a wonderful surprise.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.982
What are you doing home?
Well, I got some time off.

27:32.017 --> 27:35.020
Thought I'd come down and visit.
See my beautiful young mother.

27:35.055 --> 27:38.040
Oh. I'm so thrilled.

27:38.075 --> 27:40.551
Bud, do you see?

27:40.586 --> 27:43.028
Peter's home.

27:43.528 --> 27:46.496
I'm not Bud.
I'm Jerry.

27:46.531 --> 27:49.033
I'm your goddamn husband
of 31 years.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.501
You hardly ever
even see this kid,

27:51.536 --> 27:54.039
and his name comes back
to you clear as a bell.

27:54.539 --> 27:56.541
I'm here all the time.

27:57.542 --> 28:00.045
Aw. Never mind.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.047
Geez.

28:09.287 --> 28:12.791
Hey, how you doing, Chief?
Fred.

28:12.826 --> 28:15.293
What'd you say?
Huh?

28:16.795 --> 28:19.297
Did you just call me Fred?

28:19.332 --> 28:21.264
No.

28:21.299 --> 28:23.301
Why would I do that?

28:23.668 --> 28:25.470
I don't know.

28:27.238 --> 28:30.742
Maybe you're getting what
we used to call "wet brain."

28:31.743 --> 28:34.611
Gavin--
You're hearing things.

28:34.646 --> 28:39.317
Maybe you're taking too many
of those cold-allergy things.

28:41.152 --> 28:43.154
I don't think so.

28:44.489 --> 28:47.659
- You done yet?
- No.

28:53.331 --> 28:55.333
Cut that awful close,
Jerry.

28:55.368 --> 28:57.335
How you doing?

28:59.170 --> 29:01.137
Never been better.

29:01.172 --> 29:04.140
So when you say you don't
mind not being the man--

29:04.175 --> 29:06.678
No, that's not what I said. I'm afraid
so, Probie. It was an exact quote.

29:06.713 --> 29:08.680
I mean, when you're
with this gargantuan woman--

29:09.180 --> 29:11.648
this Amazon, okay,
this high rise with tits--

29:11.683 --> 29:14.686
and you close your eyes, either on your
own power or because of the vertigo,

29:14.721 --> 29:18.189
do you imagine the fact that
she is the person in control?

29:18.423 --> 29:20.291
Uh--

29:20.592 --> 29:22.127
Okay, that's not the answer
we were looking for.

29:22.627 --> 29:24.195
- I think he likes her to be the man.
- Yeah.

29:24.696 --> 29:28.199
No. No, I don't. Not exactly.
I mean, it's hard to explain.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.166
Jesus Christ. This is
worse than I thought.

29:30.201 --> 29:32.168
Hey, ladies. What's going
on? Mike might be gay.

29:32.203 --> 29:35.171
It's not official yet.
Well, you know, "gay-ish."

29:35.206 --> 29:37.976
- Meanwhile I think I know your new girlfriend.
- She's not my girlfriend, Lou.

29:38.011 --> 29:40.176
Yes, she is. I can swear
I met her someplace.

29:40.211 --> 29:44.549
- In your dreams, maybe?
- Kid, my dreams are all filled up with Candace Bergen,

29:44.584 --> 29:46.349
a chocolate wheelchair
and the Olsen twins.

29:46.384 --> 29:48.219
I've had that same dream--
except it's Carly Simon...

29:48.254 --> 29:50.221
and a big tub
of chunky peanut butter.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.324
- Why chunky?
- Better traction.

29:52.359 --> 29:54.627
- I know I know her face.
- Who?

29:54.662 --> 29:56.860
Excuse me, guys.
Chief Reilly here?

29:56.895 --> 29:58.962
Yeah. I'm Reilly.
What can I do for you?

29:58.997 --> 30:02.031
Bob Kent from H.Q. I need
you to get your crew together.

30:02.066 --> 30:04.903
Get them on the engine and have
them report to the rock immediately.

30:04.938 --> 30:06.703
Your house is closed
for the rest of the day.

30:06.738 --> 30:09.123
What the hell is going on?
What are you talking about?

30:09.158 --> 30:11.509
A grievance has been filed
against a member of this house.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.544
That person opted to take
sensitivity training.

30:14.579 --> 30:18.416
I opted to take it. Not the
whole crew. Doesn't work that way.

30:18.451 --> 30:21.586
Let's go.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.394
Okay, okay, guys,
listen up.

30:31.429 --> 30:34.933
Quiet. Listen up.
Gentlemen... and lady.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.066
Class only takes eight hours,

30:37.101 --> 30:40.939
and I can safely say it beats
having to risk your life in a fire.

30:41.172 --> 30:44.709
By how much, I can't say.
Don.

30:44.744 --> 30:47.712
Thanks, Bob.

30:48.713 --> 30:51.514
Hi, guys. Don Kleinman.

30:51.549 --> 30:54.285
I know nobody wants to be here. Yeah,
seeing as how the neighborhood we serve...

30:54.320 --> 30:57.288
is short a rig for the next eight
hours-- Yeah, we ain't happy.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.123
Fair enough.

30:59.624 --> 31:03.092
Now, how many of you--
being totally honest now--

31:03.127 --> 31:06.731
How many of you would say that
you're prejudiced? Show of hands.

31:06.766 --> 31:09.368
Okay, so, you know,
this is the usual response.

31:09.403 --> 31:11.970
No one identifies him-
or herself as prejudiced.

31:12.005 --> 31:14.739
We all think--
Okay, we have a hand up.

31:14.774 --> 31:16.291
You think you're prejudiced?
Yup.

31:16.326 --> 31:17.774
Against who?
Well, let's see.

31:17.809 --> 31:20.645
Chevy Neons that cost 12 grand to
buy but have $8,000 paint jobs...

31:20.680 --> 31:23.147
and nine spics inside 'em
smoking weed, that's one thing.

31:23.648 --> 31:25.650
Okay, now listen.
The term "spic--"

31:25.884 --> 31:28.319
- It's okay. I'm a spic.
- Well, see, that's really not--

31:28.686 --> 31:30.755
Crazy Chink broads who don't know
how to drive in the first place,

31:30.790 --> 31:32.824
and now they got cell phones stuck
to their ears while they're...

31:32.859 --> 31:34.993
doing 65 miles an hour down
Sixth Avenue, huh? Right?

31:35.226 --> 31:38.263
And crazy Chinks on bikes with 10 pounds
of Chinese food strapped to the handlebars--

31:38.298 --> 31:41.817
Now, see, the word "Chink" is
what I like to call a problem word.

31:41.852 --> 31:45.336
Uh, if I were a Chink, I'd rather
be called a Chink than a gook.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.303
Okay, now hold on.
Listen to me, please.

31:47.338 --> 31:51.509
Chinese people would not like
to be called gook or Chink...

31:51.544 --> 31:55.680
- or pan face or zipper head
or-- - See, that's another thing.

31:56.180 --> 31:58.182
I mean, Puerto Ricans, we get
shafted even when it comes to racism.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.953
Chinks got what, like, four ethnic
slurs. We got one-- spic. That's it.

32:01.988 --> 32:04.153
The Irish, they got
mick, paddy, donkey.

32:04.188 --> 32:07.859
-Italians-- They got guinea, wop,
dago. - Yeah. Spaghetti bender.

32:08.359 --> 32:10.695
Aw, spaghetti bender went out of
style during Sinatra's first marriage.

32:10.730 --> 32:13.364
- Greaseball?
- Greaseball. There you have it. That's four.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.598
That's right. Same thing
with the Jews, right?

32:15.633 --> 32:17.834
- Hebe, kike, Jew-boy, benny--
Shylock.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.669
That's five. Yeah. And black
people-- Forget about it.

32:19.704 --> 32:23.474
- Spear chucker, jungle bunny,
raisin head, porch monkey-- - Spook.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.275
Shine.
Tar baby.

32:25.310 --> 32:29.047
- It's endless. Totally unfair.
- Yeah.

32:30.214 --> 32:32.550
What?

32:34.052 --> 32:36.054
I have a video that I would
like you to watch.

32:36.089 --> 32:38.021
Hopefully it will, uh--

32:38.056 --> 32:41.392
it'll spark some--
some serious thoughts.

32:44.429 --> 32:45.897
Hey! How's it going?

32:46.397 --> 32:48.865
Hey, did you catch the
big game last night?

32:48.900 --> 32:52.403
No. You assumed I was a
sports fan because I'm black.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.906
I was at the theater
last night.

32:56.407 --> 32:58.374
Well, hey, that's--

32:58.409 --> 33:01.412
Remember. Sensitivity is needed
when dealing with others--

33:01.913 --> 33:03.915
especially those
with different ethnicities,

33:03.950 --> 33:07.185
and those of the opposite sex.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.523
In conclusion,
don't be like our friend.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.927
Ooh. You people
have the best produce.

33:15.962 --> 33:18.895
What do you mean,
"you people"?

33:18.930 --> 33:20.932
Show the same sensitivity
to others...

33:21.432 --> 33:23.900
that you would like
others to show to you. Hey!

33:23.935 --> 33:27.939
It makes for a better workplace,
and a better world for us all.

33:30.508 --> 33:33.611
Okay, now what did we learn
from that? Any thoughts?

33:33.646 --> 33:37.580
- Yes.
- Only white people can be racist?

33:37.615 --> 33:40.534
That wasn't the point of the
video. Well, it's pretty obvious.

33:40.569 --> 33:43.454
I mean, where were the black guys
calling white people crackers?

33:43.855 --> 33:46.657
Where were the Mexicans shitting
all over the Puerto Ricans?

33:46.692 --> 33:49.460
You know? Where were the Chinese
people making fun of the Japs,

33:49.495 --> 33:51.094
who hate the Koreans,
who hate--

33:51.129 --> 33:53.131
Okay, now hold on. Hold on.
No. This is bullshit.

33:53.631 --> 33:55.967
The only reason we're here is because somebody
in our group called somebody else a name.

33:56.334 --> 33:58.803
It was "twat," by the way.
Just so we're clear.

33:58.838 --> 34:01.239
It's just to cover
the F.D.N.Y.'s ass.

34:01.274 --> 34:03.641
That's all this is good for,
you know?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.410
Just in case some Puerto Rican
woman or some fat Chinese guy...

34:05.910 --> 34:07.412
files a lawsuit
against the F.D.N.Y.,

34:07.912 --> 34:10.748
or God help us, there's another
disgruntled female firefighter...

34:10.783 --> 34:12.447
who thinks she has a case--

34:12.483 --> 34:13.985
The F.D.N.Y. can say, "No, no,
no. They can't be prejudiced.

34:14.020 --> 34:15.451
They took this horseshit
sensitivity training."

34:15.485 --> 34:17.487
Let me tell you something. Next
time I run into a burning building...

34:17.989 --> 34:20.456
and refuse to bring out anybody
who's not the same color as me--

34:20.491 --> 34:24.996
That's when you can bring my angry,
sober, pink Irish ass back down here.

34:25.031 --> 34:27.165
Got it? I'm going outside for a smoke.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.505
Ten-minute break,
everybody.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.547
You happy now? Oh, yeah,
like this is my fault.

34:44.014 --> 34:45.516
I'm not the one
who lost his temper...

34:46.016 --> 34:48.453
and shot his mouth off
like an idiot.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.455
You just don't
get it, do you?

34:50.489 --> 34:52.975
You hate me.
I get it.

34:53.010 --> 34:55.460
That's not what I mean.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.463
This person you're
talking to right now--

34:58.963 --> 35:00.465
I don't know
who this guy is.

35:00.965 --> 35:02.467
I mean, I know it's me,
of course, but--

35:02.967 --> 35:04.934
Who I am?

35:04.969 --> 35:07.472
I got no clue.

35:08.973 --> 35:11.476
I was married. I thought I'd be
with her until I got burned up...

35:11.511 --> 35:13.478
or she put me
in the ground...

35:13.978 --> 35:16.481
with her nonstop talking
about bullshit...

35:16.981 --> 35:18.816
that normal people don't
waste their breath on.

35:18.851 --> 35:21.017
Commercials.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.887
What she ate that day.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.391
How some colors are more
healing than others.

35:30.895 --> 35:33.397
Now I got no wife.
It's like-- I swear--

35:34.899 --> 35:36.901
It's like my life
just jumped the tracks,

35:37.401 --> 35:39.904
and now I'm running
on someone else's tracks,

35:39.939 --> 35:41.906
leading someone else's life.

35:43.741 --> 35:47.710
You know, you--
Most of these clowns--

35:47.745 --> 35:50.748
You're younger than me.
You got possibilities.

35:50.783 --> 35:53.216
You got options.

35:53.251 --> 35:55.753
If this gig
didn't work out for you,

35:55.788 --> 35:57.755
you could get married.

35:58.756 --> 36:00.723
Bake cakes.

36:00.758 --> 36:03.761
Open a dress shop.

36:04.762 --> 36:07.264
I got no dress shop.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.767
I got no future.

36:11.769 --> 36:14.021
This is all I got.

36:14.056 --> 36:16.274
It's all I am.

36:18.776 --> 36:20.778
Don't make me change...

36:20.813 --> 36:22.780
how I do it, Laura.

36:24.782 --> 36:26.784
One more change...

36:26.819 --> 36:28.786
and I think I'm done.

36:34.959 --> 36:36.727
I'm gonna take that
as an apology.

36:39.463 --> 36:41.465
I wish to hell
you wouldn't.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.620
Shit.

37:02.655 --> 37:04.655
Shit.

37:07.658 --> 37:09.660
Damn it.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.176
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:27.178 --> 37:30.681
Listen. I like you.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.452
I think you should go with
your gut here. What do you mean?

37:34.885 --> 37:38.022
Go get your kids, 'cause
they're the most important thing.

37:38.422 --> 37:39.957
I never had any...

37:40.458 --> 37:42.793
because my husband
was too... busy.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.362
You imagine that?

37:44.595 --> 37:46.631
Guy hasn't had a job
the entire time I've known him,

37:46.666 --> 37:48.497
and he was too busy
to have kids.

37:48.532 --> 37:52.168
- So, you guys are married?
- Common law.

37:52.203 --> 37:55.172
Come on. We've been shacking up
for 2,000 years.

37:55.207 --> 37:58.142
Of course, his mother
doesn't see it that way.

37:58.177 --> 38:02.713
According to her,
she's still a virgin.

38:02.947 --> 38:07.151
Shit. My ride's here.

38:11.989 --> 38:14.457
Do you love your wife?

38:14.492 --> 38:17.161
Yeah. I-I-- I guess I do.
Yeah.

38:17.196 --> 38:19.830
Does she love you?
I don't know.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.300
Life's too short, Tommy.

38:22.335 --> 38:24.700
Sheila doesn't love you,

38:24.735 --> 38:26.570
but she loves being with you.

38:27.071 --> 38:28.839
Right now, that's the best
you've got.

38:29.106 --> 38:31.075
Make her happy.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.344
Make yourself happy.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.017
See you later.
Bye.

39:05.109 --> 39:07.576
Oh, God!

39:07.611 --> 39:09.578
Goddamn it!
What the hell.

39:09.613 --> 39:12.581
You scared the shit out of me.
I--

39:12.616 --> 39:14.618
Just trying to surprise you.

39:15.119 --> 39:17.621
Well, you did.

39:17.656 --> 39:20.089
Mmm.

39:20.124 --> 39:22.626
Mmm. No need for booze tonight, baby.

39:26.130 --> 39:28.097
Damien's--
I know.

39:28.132 --> 39:30.134
Drove him to a friend's house.
He's staying there for the night.

39:30.169 --> 39:32.320
I checked and made sure
he did his homework.

39:32.355 --> 39:34.472
Gave him 40 bucks in
spending money. So--

39:35.473 --> 39:37.475
I own you tonight.

39:52.823 --> 39:54.825
I want you

39:56.827 --> 39:59.597
Said I want you

40:07.605 --> 40:11.008
I want you

40:13.010 --> 40:15.012
I need you

40:17.014 --> 40:19.482
I said I need you

40:19.517 --> 40:21.519
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

40:21.554 --> 40:23.486
Ow. Ow. Ow.

40:23.521 --> 40:25.488
Oh, yeah. Do it again.
No. Ow!

40:25.523 --> 40:28.859
- What, what, what?
- Friction, Tommy. Ever heard of it?

40:28.894 --> 40:31.160
Ow! God,
what is going on?

40:31.195 --> 40:33.697
I'm sorry. I thought you
were having a good time.

40:33.732 --> 40:36.031
Are you on drugs?

40:36.066 --> 40:38.601
Yeah. What--

40:38.636 --> 40:40.836
What drugs
would I be on?

40:40.871 --> 40:43.641
You're on them pills--
Them cock pills, aren't you?

40:43.676 --> 40:45.341
What cock pills? This is--

40:45.376 --> 40:48.212
You know, last week you were
trying to pour vodka down my throat,

40:48.247 --> 40:50.179
and this week, you know,
I come over,

40:50.214 --> 40:53.717
I got a giant au naturel hard-on for
you, and it's still not good enough.

40:53.752 --> 40:57.054
I mean-- You're
really not on anything?

40:57.089 --> 40:58.889
No.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.858
Come on. Come back up.

41:02.893 --> 41:04.811
No, no, no,
but-- Ow! What?

41:04.846 --> 41:07.123
It's been, like, two hours.

41:07.158 --> 41:09.365
Listen. Why don't you...

41:09.400 --> 41:12.236
go out to the car and get
the rest of the groceries--

41:12.271 --> 41:15.089
Yeah?
And when you come back--

41:15.124 --> 41:17.873
Uh-huh.
I will give you...

41:17.908 --> 41:20.911
the best blow job
you've ever had.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.878
Okay.

41:22.913 --> 41:25.416
But, you know,
it could take some time.

41:25.916 --> 41:27.918
We'll see about that.

42:08.792 --> 42:11.629
Hello. Hey. It's,
uh-- It's Dr. Fred.

42:11.664 --> 42:14.131
Oh, hi.
Sorry to call so late.

42:14.166 --> 42:16.098
Uh--

42:16.133 --> 42:21.639
- I wanna ask you a question. I know it might sound strange.
- I'm sure it won't. What?

42:21.674 --> 42:24.642
Do you know if a woman who is, let's
say, like, four months pregnant--

42:24.677 --> 42:27.412
Would she have any need
to use tampons?

42:27.447 --> 42:30.112
No, I--
I really need to know.

42:30.147 --> 42:33.150
- But you're a doctor.
- Well, I'm a brain doctor.

42:33.185 --> 42:35.152
I mean, the brain's my thing,
not the vagina.

42:35.653 --> 42:37.655
I mean, the vagina's my thing
when it comes to sex,

42:37.690 --> 42:40.623
but not the other stuff,
you know?

42:40.658 --> 42:45.162
Uh, a woman who's that
pregnant would not need tampons.

42:45.197 --> 42:47.998
- Is this your way of--
- Great. Thank you.

42:48.033 --> 42:50.466
Hello?

42:50.501 --> 42:54.004
For Mary Magdelene

42:56.006 --> 42:58.974
Wouldn't have to wait

42:59.009 --> 43:03.263
Wait around
for the real thing

43:03.298 --> 43:07.518
With the band singing
hallelujah

43:08.018 --> 43:09.987
Hallelujah

43:53.530 --> 43:54.732
Cloudland.
