WEBVTT

00:07.517 --> 00:10.620
- Here, here, here, here.
- Confess, Kitty.

00:10.689 --> 00:12.206
- Let go!
- Confess!

00:12.275 --> 00:13.793
Come on, Shell.

00:13.862 --> 00:15.758
We've got nothing else to do.
Now we're stranded.

00:15.827 --> 00:18.551
I'm as responsible for
that boy's death as you are.

00:18.620 --> 00:19.724
That's why I'm here.

00:19.793 --> 00:21.448
Because we can't
run away forever.

00:23.103 --> 00:25.827
You're all going to jail,
you fuckers!

00:25.896 --> 00:28.172
Joseph!

00:28.241 --> 00:29.620
- We're all guilty.
- No.

00:29.689 --> 00:32.413
We're murderers.
Confess.

00:32.482 --> 00:35.275
- Confess!
- No!

00:35.344 --> 00:39.206
Did I kill Joseph, too?

00:39.275 --> 00:40.896
I won't tell.

00:40.965 --> 00:43.103
According to the log book,
we left him in the Philippines.

00:47.827 --> 00:52.827
Fuck, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I couldn't save her.

00:55.896 --> 00:58.068
Perhaps your friends
didn't perish in quite the way

00:58.137 --> 01:01.413
he's telling it,
assuming they really are dead.

01:01.482 --> 01:02.689
My mom and dad are cool.

01:02.758 --> 01:08.586
You can stay
as long as you like.

02:12.896 --> 02:14.724
Candy, officer.
Candy.

02:14.793 --> 02:19.137
Sell my candy, Officer.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.689
OK, now.

02:22.655 --> 02:24.068
Thank you, sir.
God bless you, sir.

02:24.137 --> 02:25.586
Thank you.

03:07.413 --> 03:10.620
Kitty! Kitty!

03:23.931 --> 03:27.620
Help! Help! Help! Help!

03:27.689 --> 03:31.517
- Kitty, where are you?
- Joseph!

03:31.586 --> 03:34.758
Get off me!
Miss!

03:34.827 --> 03:37.344
Miss, take my hand.

03:37.413 --> 03:39.275
Kitty!

03:39.344 --> 03:41.517
Why did you do that?

03:43.482 --> 03:47.931
Please come with me.
Follow me, miss.

03:57.172 --> 03:59.724
This is not a place
for tourists.

03:59.793 --> 04:01.655
Go.

04:15.655 --> 04:19.068
When we were
in the Philippines, um...

04:19.137 --> 04:24.551
Aaron took me to the museum...

04:24.620 --> 04:27.517
to see something
called the Manunggul Jar.

04:27.586 --> 04:30.310
I think that's how you say it.

04:32.482 --> 04:33.965
It's a, uh--

04:34.034 --> 04:37.862
It's a kind of ancient
Filipino burial container,

04:37.931 --> 04:42.793
and it depicts a boatman
taking the spirit of a dead man

04:42.862 --> 04:44.448
to the afterlife.

04:53.344 --> 04:58.655
If that's where Aaron is now...

04:58.724 --> 05:01.275
I hope that boatman knows
what he's doing.

05:04.413 --> 05:06.137
Because he wasn't
just my brother,

05:06.206 --> 05:07.965
he was my captain.

05:10.103 --> 05:13.379
And through fair weather
or foul,

05:13.448 --> 05:15.655
he always knew
what he was doing.

05:21.586 --> 05:23.896
He always had the answers.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.551
♪ All the things
that I ran from ♪

06:05.620 --> 06:11.275
♪ I now bring as close
to me as I can ♪

06:11.344 --> 06:16.379
♪ Ripping hotel sheets
with gritted teeth ♪

06:16.448 --> 06:19.413
♪ My montage of lost things ♪

06:19.482 --> 06:24.689
♪ My shiny ♪

06:24.758 --> 06:28.482
♪ Trinkets of grief ♪

06:38.620 --> 06:41.827
- Get ready to tack.
- Yeah.

06:41.896 --> 06:42.827
Tacking.

06:55.965 --> 06:57.344
Good job.

07:23.931 --> 07:25.310
OK?

07:27.931 --> 07:29.586
Kitty.

08:03.379 --> 08:04.344
Wait.

08:04.413 --> 08:06.000
What are you doing?

08:06.068 --> 08:07.482
That's Joseph's stuff.

08:09.551 --> 08:11.206
Wait, Aaron.
Aaron, stop.

08:11.275 --> 08:13.413
What are you doing?
It can't stay on board!

08:13.482 --> 08:14.827
His family--

08:14.896 --> 08:16.000
his family is going
to want some of this stuff!

08:16.068 --> 08:17.689
What are we going to say
to them?

08:17.758 --> 08:19.965
That he fell overboard
and we didn't sound the alarm?

08:20.034 --> 08:21.586
That's exactly what happened,
wasn't it?

08:21.655 --> 08:22.862
Fucking abandoned him.
No, no.

08:22.931 --> 08:26.310
Aaron, stop.

08:26.379 --> 08:30.206
I know it's cold, but
there's nothing we can do now.

08:33.896 --> 08:36.344
Hey, this is difficult
for all of us, all right?

08:36.413 --> 08:39.448
We're hungry, we're tired,
so let's just get to Palau,

08:39.517 --> 08:43.344
re-up, and then we'll sail on
with no more incidents, OK?

08:43.413 --> 08:47.000
"Incidents."

08:49.206 --> 08:51.448
Ugh, this is so fucking wrong.

09:28.620 --> 09:30.862
Does everyone hate me?

09:33.620 --> 09:36.310
Lana?

09:43.103 --> 09:45.034
Hey.

09:45.103 --> 09:46.620
You OK?

09:48.379 --> 09:52.103
As soon as we're on dry land,
we're gone.

09:52.172 --> 09:54.724
You coming?

09:54.793 --> 09:58.000
Yeah.
Of course.

09:58.068 --> 10:00.068
You know I'm in.

10:03.275 --> 10:05.103
Start running the anchor!

10:05.172 --> 10:07.517
We're drawing in.
Why are they dropping here?

10:07.586 --> 10:08.862
No idea.

10:14.103 --> 10:15.758
- Just this thing?
- Yeah.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.206
Heinrich?

10:19.275 --> 10:21.793
What's going on?
What are you doing?

10:21.862 --> 10:23.137
Palau's in sight.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.241
We're taking the tender
the rest of the way.

10:24.310 --> 10:26.241
Why not sail into harbor?

10:26.310 --> 10:30.241
You two can stay with
the boat and look after it.

10:30.310 --> 10:31.655
What?

10:31.724 --> 10:34.689
Since when did
she need looking after?

10:34.758 --> 10:37.655
It's not my fault
they don't have passports.

10:37.724 --> 10:38.965
Yeah, but if
you're taking the tender,

10:39.034 --> 10:39.862
immigration isn't gonna
bat an eyelid.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.172
No, this is about Joseph.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.793
You think I'm going
to run to the police.

10:42.862 --> 10:45.620
Look, we know you're
not happy about what happened.

10:45.689 --> 10:47.862
No one is--
So we can't leave now?

10:47.931 --> 10:49.103
You're going to lock
us in a cupboard,

10:49.172 --> 10:50.103
like you did with him?

10:50.172 --> 10:52.413
It's only a quick stop.

10:52.482 --> 10:54.413
Parts, fuel, food, and water.

10:54.482 --> 10:55.551
Soon, we'll be in the Solomons,

10:55.620 --> 10:57.379
and you can do
whatever you want.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.068
When everyone's cooled down.

11:04.827 --> 11:06.172
This is bullshit.

11:10.172 --> 11:13.551
Yeah. All right, fine.
I'll--I'll stay back till then.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.344
No.

11:16.413 --> 11:17.758
If you really don't trust them,

11:17.827 --> 11:19.655
I'll stay aboard and
keep an eye on them for you.

11:19.724 --> 11:21.241
Den, you're coming with me.

11:21.310 --> 11:22.862
Aaron, I don't need
anything from shore.

11:22.931 --> 11:24.758
There'll be more room
on the tender.

11:24.827 --> 11:26.896
I want a paper trail
for those of us

11:26.965 --> 11:28.517
who can actually have one.

11:28.586 --> 11:31.172
That means we clear out,
go to immigration by ourselves.

11:31.241 --> 11:34.206
We do everything by the book,
you included.

11:34.275 --> 11:36.758
Since when
did we do it by the book?

11:36.827 --> 11:41.137
Since Joseph.
Now get ready.

11:41.206 --> 11:42.724
Heinrich, one more, mate.

12:00.172 --> 12:03.068
- Champagne, miss?
- I'm OK. Thank you.

12:27.551 --> 12:30.241
Al, thank you so
much for coming.

12:44.620 --> 12:47.344
Oh, could I have some?
Thank you.

12:49.758 --> 12:51.827
Do you really
think he's lying?

12:51.896 --> 12:57.379
Or are you just
fucking with me?

12:57.448 --> 13:01.724
Do you think that that's OK?

13:01.793 --> 13:05.000
The way they feel
about Aaron's death

13:05.068 --> 13:08.206
is the way I feel about
Danilo de la Cruz.

13:08.275 --> 13:11.448
That's the last funeral
I went to.

13:11.517 --> 13:13.137
Joseph Melina was there,

13:13.206 --> 13:17.413
and the girl from the photo
I showed you...

13:17.482 --> 13:19.413
the girl you don't know.

13:21.827 --> 13:24.551
Another stop
on the tourist trail.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.620
Some like to take
another selfie.

13:26.689 --> 13:29.862
They weren't.

13:29.931 --> 13:34.724
Joseph wasn't like that.

13:34.793 --> 13:38.034
Nice place.

13:38.103 --> 13:40.724
Do you live here now?

13:40.793 --> 13:44.620
Just staying
for a few nights.

13:44.689 --> 13:49.448
Are you in a relationship
with Dennis Winbourne?

13:49.517 --> 13:51.862
No.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.793
Then why were you waiting
in Townsville?

13:54.862 --> 13:57.965
It had to be something
in "The Blue."

13:58.034 --> 14:00.551
But if not Denny or
any of the others, then what?

14:00.620 --> 14:04.275
Peter?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.862
Excuse me.

14:05.931 --> 14:07.206
Perhaps your share

14:07.275 --> 14:08.724
of the diamonds
from the trawler in Sagisag?

14:08.793 --> 14:10.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:10.068 --> 14:13.275
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:13.344 --> 14:15.655
The detective here was
just asking some questions,

14:15.724 --> 14:17.344
and I didn't know whether
to talk without a lawyer or--

14:17.413 --> 14:20.413
Questions?

14:20.482 --> 14:22.413
At my son's funeral.

14:22.482 --> 14:26.034
I don't know how you do things
in the Philippines,

14:26.103 --> 14:29.862
but in Australia,
a funeral is a somber

14:29.931 --> 14:32.931
and reflective affair.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.172
This is my house,

14:35.241 --> 14:37.862
so stop harassing
my family and friends,

14:37.931 --> 14:40.034
and leave us to our grief!

14:41.620 --> 14:43.103
My condolences.

14:56.965 --> 14:58.896
Sir.

17:10.034 --> 17:12.275
You just have to ignore him,
Lana.

17:14.137 --> 17:16.000
He knows stuff.

17:16.689 --> 17:18.068
Yeah?

17:19.620 --> 17:21.068
Like what?

17:23.517 --> 17:25.689
He's asking
if we're together.

17:31.931 --> 17:33.344
Well, aren't we?

17:37.655 --> 17:40.965
He said the--

17:41.034 --> 17:44.931
the bullets fired on "The Blue"
all came from one gun,

17:45.000 --> 17:46.344
a revolver.

17:48.655 --> 17:50.241
So?

17:56.482 --> 17:58.344
Aaron's gun was a revolver.

18:06.137 --> 18:07.793
What are you saying?

18:11.689 --> 18:15.793
I'm just trying to understand
what happened.

18:21.206 --> 18:25.068
Because you said that

18:25.137 --> 18:28.206
all the guys on "The Blue"
had a gun.

18:31.103 --> 18:32.413
So--

18:32.482 --> 18:34.103
Right.

18:38.379 --> 18:43.965
The bullets came
from Aaron's gun...

18:44.034 --> 18:47.310
because they took it out of
his hand

18:47.379 --> 18:49.379
after they killed him.

18:56.310 --> 18:59.896
Then they ran the others out.

18:59.965 --> 19:02.103
On the deck.

19:06.655 --> 19:08.172
They used it.

19:08.241 --> 19:09.586
But you didn't tell me that.

19:09.655 --> 19:11.413
Well, I didn't tell you
every gory detail,

19:11.482 --> 19:13.344
but I can tell you how it all
happened, if you like.

19:13.413 --> 19:14.931
No, no.
Stop, stop.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.620
Yeah.
How they all died.

19:18.827 --> 19:20.172
You think I want
this shit in my head?

19:20.241 --> 19:22.482
No.
I'm sorry.

19:22.551 --> 19:23.620
I'm sorry.

19:25.724 --> 19:27.103
I'm sorry.

19:32.517 --> 19:37.275
I know you find it hard
to trust people.

19:37.344 --> 19:41.310
I've invited you into my home.

19:41.379 --> 19:43.000
My family.
Yeah.

19:43.068 --> 19:44.379
I don't know
what I was thinking.

19:44.448 --> 19:45.551
I don't know--I don't know
what I was thinking.

19:45.620 --> 19:46.758
I think--

19:50.379 --> 19:53.310
I think I just hoped
that you were lying,

19:53.379 --> 19:55.620
because then
Kitty would still be alive.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.758
I wish I was lying.

20:04.965 --> 20:06.724
But I'm not.

20:20.448 --> 20:22.689
We have to trust each other,
Lana.

20:26.413 --> 20:28.344
We are together, right?

20:33.034 --> 20:34.896
Yeah.

21:12.793 --> 21:13.931
Are you OK?

21:20.586 --> 21:22.689
Yeah.

21:22.758 --> 21:25.517
Um, come on.

21:25.586 --> 21:27.793
We need to get going.

21:27.862 --> 21:28.931
What?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.344
This will buy us some time.

21:31.413 --> 21:35.241
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting off this boat.

21:35.310 --> 21:37.034
How?
We're too far from anything.

21:37.103 --> 21:41.551
Not from that fishing boat.
He can take us inland.

21:41.620 --> 21:43.275
No, that's still too far.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.689
Fine.
Use a ring.

21:44.758 --> 21:46.137
I'll put a life jacket on you,
and I'll pull you.

21:46.206 --> 21:47.413
I know we can do it.

21:47.482 --> 21:49.034
We just have to move so that

21:49.103 --> 21:52.000
we do it before
that boat leaves

21:52.068 --> 21:55.103
and before they get back,
OK?

22:15.275 --> 22:16.793
Lana,
we don't have passports.

22:16.862 --> 22:18.482
We don't have money.
We can't do this.

22:18.551 --> 22:20.724
Yeah, we've got these.

22:24.517 --> 22:27.413
But you--
you said you ditched them.

22:27.482 --> 22:30.310
Denny and I kept them.
I should have told you.

22:30.379 --> 22:32.137
We can get fake passport
in Palau, I think.

22:32.206 --> 22:33.379
Denny said there were places.

22:33.448 --> 22:36.413
We can get new names
and new birthdays.

22:39.655 --> 22:42.724
Uh, I need you to jump,

22:42.793 --> 22:45.931
and then tread water
like I showed you.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.517
And then I will--
I'll pull you to the boat, OK?

22:50.586 --> 22:51.862
I just need you to relax.

22:51.931 --> 22:53.413
Stay calm.
OK?

22:53.482 --> 22:55.758
And stay calm. Stay calm.

22:55.827 --> 22:57.068
Calm...calm...

23:02.103 --> 23:05.689
And I know it's scary.
It's really scary.

23:05.758 --> 23:08.241
But anything is better
than staying on this boat.

23:08.310 --> 23:09.758
You saw what they did
to Joseph.

23:09.827 --> 23:13.068
Now they've trapped us here.
Fuck that.

23:13.137 --> 23:14.034
Fuck that.

23:14.103 --> 23:15.517
They're bad people...

23:15.586 --> 23:18.310
they're bad people...
they're bad people...

23:18.379 --> 23:20.931
But it's going to be fine.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.068
It's going to be fine.
It's going to be fine.

23:24.137 --> 23:25.620
It is.

23:25.689 --> 23:27.068
OK?

23:31.137 --> 23:32.482
I--

23:34.379 --> 23:35.758
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:35.827 --> 23:37.034
Yeah?

23:37.103 --> 23:38.827
OK.

23:38.896 --> 23:40.344
OK.

23:52.620 --> 23:53.793
Come on!

23:53.862 --> 23:56.482
Come on, it'll be fine.
Don't be scared.

24:00.068 --> 24:04.551
Kitty, you need to jump, now!

24:04.620 --> 24:06.793
Come on! It's fine.
It's fine!

24:06.862 --> 24:08.137
Look, it's safe.

24:08.206 --> 24:10.482
Come on.
Get in.

24:10.551 --> 24:12.275
- I can't.
- You can do it, you can do it.

24:12.344 --> 24:14.275
I'm so sorry.
It's my fault.

24:14.344 --> 24:16.413
What are you talking about?
Kitty, you need to jump.

24:16.482 --> 24:19.206
You have to go right now.
You're better off without me.

24:19.275 --> 24:20.758
No!
I'm fucking not.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.862
You can't--this--
this is crazy!

24:22.931 --> 24:26.448
I killed Joseph.
It was me. It was me.

24:26.517 --> 24:28.862
It was so dark,
and I must have just--

24:28.931 --> 24:31.206
just--just lashed out,
like I did with Ma.

24:31.275 --> 24:33.344
- It can't be.
- No, it wasn't.

24:33.413 --> 24:35.586
It wasn't.
I'm a bad person.

24:35.655 --> 24:37.103
And I don't deserve
to be saved.

24:37.172 --> 24:39.379
This is Sandra talking!
Please! It's not real.

24:39.448 --> 24:40.793
No, no.

24:40.862 --> 24:42.344
You've got to go now, quick.
They're coming.

24:42.413 --> 24:43.862
- Throw down the ladder.
- Go!

24:43.931 --> 24:46.034
Kitty, I'm stuck
and trapped down here.

24:46.103 --> 24:48.137
Throw down the ladder, please.
No!

24:48.206 --> 24:49.724
I'm coming back up.

24:49.793 --> 24:51.793
No.

24:51.862 --> 24:53.448
- Coming back soon.
- No!

24:53.517 --> 24:55.344
Kitty, throw the ladder!

24:55.413 --> 24:56.655
I'm trapped!
No!

24:56.724 --> 24:58.206
If Aaron sees me down here,
I'm dead.

24:58.275 --> 24:59.862
I'm so sorry.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.482
Kitty, don't fucking do this!

25:02.551 --> 25:05.310
I'm going to drown down here!

25:05.379 --> 25:08.724
Kitty, no!
Please!

25:08.793 --> 25:11.068
Kitty, I was just
trying to help us!

25:11.137 --> 25:13.068
Kitty!

25:19.482 --> 25:20.931
Kitty!

25:21.000 --> 25:24.413
I'll meet--
meet you in Townsville.

25:24.482 --> 25:27.344
I'll wait for you.

25:27.413 --> 25:29.586
I'll wait.

26:26.931 --> 26:28.931
Kitty.

26:49.275 --> 26:53.862
You have got some balls,
asking questions at a funeral.

26:53.931 --> 26:56.620
- The girl came to me.
- About what?

26:56.689 --> 26:57.724
She's worried that

26:57.793 --> 27:00.172
Dennis Winbourne
might be lying.

27:00.241 --> 27:02.862
And why would he do that?

27:02.931 --> 27:04.862
Doesn't it strike you as odd

27:04.931 --> 27:06.758
that a gang
of heavily-armed men

27:06.827 --> 27:09.379
would use one small revolver
to carry out a massacre?

27:09.448 --> 27:10.827
I don't know, Colonel.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.758
You see, we don't get a lot
of gang-related massacres

27:12.827 --> 27:14.448
in northern Queensland.

27:14.517 --> 27:15.827
And there's this young man

27:15.896 --> 27:17.931
who also sailed on "The Blue,"
Joseph Melina.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.689
According to his sister,
he is also missing.

27:20.758 --> 27:21.965
Yeah, last seen
in the Philippines.

27:22.034 --> 27:23.103
Maybe that's where
you should be looking.

27:23.172 --> 27:24.586
My force is
doing exactly that.

27:24.655 --> 27:26.793
I just don't understand
the willingness

27:26.862 --> 27:28.827
to take Dennis Winbourne
at his word.

27:28.896 --> 27:31.931
Because as far as I can see,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.655
I mean, he's a good kid
from a good family.

27:33.724 --> 27:35.827
Son of a Supreme Court judge.

27:35.896 --> 27:39.551
We have a lot of good kids
from good families, too.

27:39.620 --> 27:41.965
Look, cop to cop, I--

27:42.034 --> 27:43.620
well,
I appreciate your diligence.

27:43.689 --> 27:45.000
I really do.

27:45.068 --> 27:46.827
But my superiors are satisfied

27:46.896 --> 27:50.137
that we've done everything
we can at this end.

27:50.206 --> 27:54.724
Do your superiors
include Peter Winbourne?

27:57.482 --> 28:00.172
Salamat,Colonel.

28:05.862 --> 28:07.655
Salamat.

28:29.482 --> 28:32.344
Rhys.

29:28.620 --> 29:30.172
You all right?

29:33.310 --> 29:34.896
Yeah.

29:38.827 --> 29:40.448
What were you dreaming about?

29:48.344 --> 29:49.827
That looks nice.

30:29.172 --> 30:33.206
So Emma, what was that
Filipino police officer

30:33.275 --> 30:35.241
asking you about
at the funeral?

30:35.310 --> 30:41.000
Uh, just the same old
questions, really.

30:41.068 --> 30:43.241
Well, you did the right thing
calling me over.

30:43.310 --> 30:46.034
I'm sure he'd like nothing
better than to shift blame

30:46.103 --> 30:48.793
for Filipino crime onto us.

30:48.862 --> 30:51.896
He told us about your friend
on "The Blue."

31:02.206 --> 31:05.275
We're sorry for your loss.

31:05.344 --> 31:07.413
But as for any problems
your friend might have had

31:07.482 --> 31:10.310
back in the UK, well,

31:10.379 --> 31:13.137
what's the point
of dredging up the past?

31:13.206 --> 31:18.310
In light of everything,
just best to leave things be.

31:20.413 --> 31:23.931
We have no secrets
in this family.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.689
We made that mistake
with Aaron.

31:25.758 --> 31:28.655
I'll--I'll be back in a sec.

31:51.068 --> 31:52.241
Following us?

31:52.310 --> 31:54.551
Us?

31:54.620 --> 31:57.344
Must be nice to be around
people so rich and powerful.

31:57.413 --> 31:59.103
Please leave us alone.

31:59.172 --> 31:59.931
Lana.

32:03.551 --> 32:05.172
Here's the thing.

32:05.241 --> 32:09.068
I don't care what you did
before you came to Balakid.

32:09.137 --> 32:12.517
I care about justice
for Danilo de la Cruz.

32:17.068 --> 32:18.758
I already told you,
I don't know--

32:18.827 --> 32:20.862
I don't know who that is.

32:20.931 --> 32:22.551
Were you the ones
who took the ransom

32:22.620 --> 32:25.000
from the trawler in Sagisag?

32:32.862 --> 32:35.137
I just want to know the truth,

32:35.206 --> 32:37.310
and maybe you do, too,

32:37.379 --> 32:40.448
about what really happened
to your friend,

32:40.517 --> 32:42.344
Kitty Walker.

32:51.793 --> 32:54.379
I--

32:54.448 --> 32:56.862
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.448
I've already told you
the truth.

33:07.379 --> 33:09.310
Oh, God.

33:09.379 --> 33:12.344
Oh, wow!

33:12.413 --> 33:14.137
- Here, here, here.
- Oh, God.

33:14.206 --> 33:16.896
Oh, my God.
Oh, oh!

33:16.965 --> 33:19.344
Wonderful, Kitty!
Well done!

33:19.413 --> 33:20.758
- It's a mess.
- Didn't know you could cook.

33:20.827 --> 33:22.689
It's so good.

33:22.758 --> 33:24.482
- Thanks.
- Uh-uh.

33:24.551 --> 33:27.827
We always say grace
before we start.

33:29.689 --> 33:31.034
You have got to be joking.

33:31.103 --> 33:32.413
You may not
live here anymore,

33:32.482 --> 33:35.034
but we're still a family, Lana,

33:35.103 --> 33:37.965
and we don't have any secrets.

33:38.034 --> 33:42.413
Confession is a positive thing.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.103
I cannot believe
that you are still doing this.

33:52.448 --> 33:55.103
Why don't you confess?
Here we go.

33:55.172 --> 33:56.448
Yeah,
confess that you're a bully,

33:56.517 --> 33:58.103
and you love making kids
feel like shit.

33:58.172 --> 33:59.448
- Yeah, OK, yeah.
- Yeah.

33:59.517 --> 34:02.448
God, Lana. Come on.
Just sit down.

34:02.517 --> 34:03.896
You know what?
When you first came here...

34:03.965 --> 34:05.413
Oh, shut up.

34:05.482 --> 34:08.896
I thought, "How? How could
a woman abandon her child?

34:08.965 --> 34:10.068
- Can we just eat?
- No!

34:10.137 --> 34:12.034
If I'd given birth to you,

34:12.103 --> 34:13.724
I'd have done
exactly the same thing.

34:16.586 --> 34:17.965
No!
No!

34:18.034 --> 34:19.137
- Come on, come on.
- Stop!

34:19.206 --> 34:20.551
Get off her!

35:10.344 --> 35:11.758
- Lana.
- Oi!

35:11.827 --> 35:13.379
Put the ladder down.

35:23.137 --> 35:24.482
Come on.

35:35.586 --> 35:37.379
Where's Lana?

35:37.448 --> 35:39.896
Heinrich, give it to Shell.

35:39.965 --> 35:41.965
Is she below deck?

35:44.965 --> 35:46.137
- Go?
- Yeah, go.

35:52.862 --> 35:54.724
Lana?

35:57.310 --> 35:59.103
She's gone.

35:59.172 --> 36:02.000
What do you mean, she's gone?
Gone where?

36:02.068 --> 36:03.965
When?

36:04.034 --> 36:05.206
- Ages ago.
- When?

36:05.275 --> 36:06.689
- I--I don't know.
- Where?

36:06.758 --> 36:09.034
Where's she going, Kitty?
She jumped, so I don't know.

36:09.103 --> 36:10.379
If she goes to the police--
if she goes to the police,

36:10.448 --> 36:11.793
you know we have
to go after her, Kitty.

36:11.862 --> 36:13.241
- No, no. She wouldn't do that.
- Just tell me.

36:13.310 --> 36:14.620
- Hey, hey!
- Chill, chill, chill, chill!

36:14.689 --> 36:16.931
- Shut the fuck up.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.448
Hey, she's just a girl, OK?

36:18.517 --> 36:19.965
Denny, don't walk away.

36:20.034 --> 36:23.793
Den!

36:23.862 --> 36:25.896
Fuel boat should be here
any minute.

36:27.965 --> 36:31.275
We have to be ready to move out
as soon as we can.

36:35.172 --> 36:36.724
I, um--

37:07.310 --> 37:08.793
Fuck!

39:07.448 --> 39:10.965
Darling,
coffee's ready downstairs.

39:11.034 --> 39:12.344
Yeah, I'm coming.

39:31.172 --> 39:33.241
Do you want a coffee?

39:33.310 --> 39:34.620
Yeah.

39:43.241 --> 39:46.344
You know, if we had some cash,
we could get out of here.

39:48.965 --> 39:50.827
Go wherever we want.

39:58.034 --> 39:59.482
Cash.

40:01.172 --> 40:02.758
Diamonds.

40:02.827 --> 40:04.931
You still got them,
haven't you?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.758
Don't.

40:07.793 --> 40:10.034
Look, I'm not the one who
should have trust issues here,

40:10.103 --> 40:11.172
all right?

40:11.241 --> 40:12.758
You ran on me, remember?

40:14.310 --> 40:15.862
But I came back.

40:18.965 --> 40:21.931
Denny, what was the
last thing Kitty said to you?

40:26.068 --> 40:27.862
What?
Why?

40:29.517 --> 40:31.379
I just need to know.

40:35.586 --> 40:37.448
All right.
Um--

40:44.344 --> 40:46.758
It was while we were
making dinner.

40:51.344 --> 40:53.344
She was talking about you.

41:00.448 --> 41:02.793
She was saying how much
she missed you.

41:06.103 --> 41:08.862
But you didn't get a chance
to speak to her after that?

41:09.931 --> 41:10.896
No.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.517
I wish I had.

41:15.241 --> 41:16.689
And there was no way
that you could have salvaged

41:16.758 --> 41:18.862
any of the bodies at all?

41:18.931 --> 41:20.896
No.
I told you, I was hiding

41:20.965 --> 41:22.931
and then I saw my chance

41:23.000 --> 41:26.034
and I hopped in the tender
and just--

41:29.379 --> 41:31.448
Is everything all right?

41:34.965 --> 41:36.137
Yeah.

41:36.206 --> 41:37.724
Yeah.

41:40.172 --> 41:42.413
Put some clothes on, Dennis.

41:42.482 --> 41:44.793
Chief Inspector Craven's here.

41:44.862 --> 41:46.758
She'd like to speak
to both of you.

41:48.103 --> 41:50.379
I've already
answered their questions.

41:50.448 --> 41:52.413
So answer them again.

41:52.482 --> 41:54.241
Be courteous.

41:54.310 --> 41:56.000
Stick to the facts.

42:01.724 --> 42:03.482
Um, we're having trouble

42:03.551 --> 42:07.586
identifying this Jessica Davis
who made the distress call.

42:08.172 --> 42:10.448
Mm-hmm.

42:10.517 --> 42:11.586
Well,
there's no one that matches

42:11.655 --> 42:12.965
the description you gave us

42:13.034 --> 42:15.620
on any of the missing persons
lists.

42:15.931 --> 42:19.620
Well, she wasn't
on board for long, so--

42:19.689 --> 42:21.586
I know she was British.

42:21.655 --> 42:23.758
Haven't we been over this,
Detective?

42:23.827 --> 42:27.724
You're right, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.

42:27.793 --> 42:31.413
Lastly, Emma,
you didn't know her?

42:32.586 --> 42:34.000
No, um00

42:34.068 --> 42:36.275
It's a shame.
You'd have gotten on.

42:36.344 --> 42:39.068
It's my understanding that
this girl only came on board

42:39.137 --> 42:41.586
in the Solomons, weeks after.

42:53.379 --> 42:55.172
Oh, please.
Please, wake up.

42:55.241 --> 42:57.758
- Please.
- Wake up!

42:57.827 --> 42:59.586
Um--

42:59.655 --> 43:02.275
Come on.
Kit, I--

43:02.344 --> 43:03.586
- Wake up!
- I think--

43:03.655 --> 43:04.827
- Come on!
- Kit.

43:04.896 --> 43:06.172
- Wake up, please!
- Kit.

43:06.241 --> 43:08.413
Mum.

43:11.103 --> 43:12.689
Please.

43:16.655 --> 43:18.827
Oh, God.
She's dead.

43:20.586 --> 43:22.655
I'm so sorry.

43:22.724 --> 43:26.586
Kit.

43:26.655 --> 43:29.448
Kit, come on.

43:29.517 --> 43:32.448
I'm so sorry.

43:32.517 --> 43:34.482
It's OK.
It's OK.

43:34.551 --> 43:36.965
Do you--
let's--

43:37.034 --> 43:41.448
um, you should go,
just wait out there.

43:47.310 --> 43:48.344
Um--

43:56.965 --> 43:59.344
Shit.

44:24.517 --> 44:26.482
What if people
don't believe--

44:26.551 --> 44:29.586
what if people don't believe
it was an accident?

44:32.000 --> 44:33.655
Lana, Lana, I didn't mean to.

44:33.724 --> 44:36.068
I know, I know.

44:36.137 --> 44:40.620
- I didn't mean to.
- I know.

44:40.689 --> 44:42.724
It was an accident.

45:16.241 --> 45:17.482
What about you, Aaron?

45:17.551 --> 45:21.275
What are you going to do
when you finally go back?

45:23.068 --> 45:25.379
I'm going to go put flowers
on Helen's grave.

45:25.448 --> 45:28.931
You don't have to.
Why make yourself miserable?

45:31.103 --> 45:33.862
Because I'm already
miserable, Denny.

45:38.344 --> 45:40.137
What about you, Denny?

45:40.206 --> 45:43.068
I don't see why we
have to go back at all.

45:43.137 --> 45:45.827
We're in the clear,
no more dramas.

45:45.896 --> 45:47.517
Why can't we go back
to how it used to be?

45:47.586 --> 45:48.517
Yeah.

45:51.620 --> 45:54.517
That fucking song.

46:01.586 --> 46:03.517
I'll go.

46:35.103 --> 46:36.137
Kitty.

46:37.310 --> 46:40.379
You OK in there?

46:49.137 --> 46:52.620
- Kitty.
- Leave me alone!

46:52.689 --> 46:55.275
Kitty, put the music down
and let me know you're OK.

46:55.344 --> 46:57.448
Talk to me. I just want to know
you're all right.

46:57.517 --> 46:59.758
Fucking hell, fine.

46:59.827 --> 47:02.068
I'm fine!

47:04.793 --> 47:07.000
And I'm not coming
to Australia.

47:13.689 --> 47:14.862
OK.

47:18.103 --> 47:21.137
Then what do you want to do?

47:25.827 --> 47:30.655
I can't keep running.

47:30.724 --> 47:32.965
Running from what?

47:38.206 --> 47:39.586
What?

47:42.241 --> 47:44.448
Why don't you open the door,

47:44.517 --> 47:46.655
and we can talk about this
face-to-face?

47:49.586 --> 47:51.931
Kitty.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.517
Whatever it is
you're running from,

47:53.586 --> 47:55.000
it's never as bad as you think.

47:55.068 --> 47:58.137
- It is, and Denny knows.
- Denny knows what?

47:58.206 --> 47:59.344
Why?

47:59.413 --> 48:01.344
Why are you pretending
that you care?

48:01.413 --> 48:03.103
I do care!

48:03.172 --> 48:06.034
- No, you don't.
- I do.

48:06.103 --> 48:08.034
It's been a difficult time
for everyone.

48:08.103 --> 48:11.586
We're just all tired
and just want to get home.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.517
I know you must miss Lana.

48:33.172 --> 48:36.724
And I'm sorry
she abandoned you.

48:36.793 --> 48:40.655
But I'm here, and I care.

48:45.896 --> 48:48.758
Can you open the door, please?

49:27.241 --> 49:30.103
Lana was wrong
to leave you, too.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
No.

49:40.965 --> 49:43.310
It didn't happen like that.

49:44.034 --> 49:46.000
That night when--

49:47.241 --> 49:52.000
Joseph. I--
I, uh--

49:54.000 --> 49:55.931
I pushed Joseph.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.793
I pushed him
and that was my fault.

49:57.862 --> 49:59.000
No.
No, no, no, no.

49:59.068 --> 50:00.448
And now he's gone.

50:00.517 --> 50:02.034
- He could have fallen in.
- No, he didn't.

50:02.103 --> 50:03.448
I pushed him.
Or jumped in.

50:03.517 --> 50:04.551
It's my fault.

50:04.620 --> 50:06.103
Hey, hey.

50:07.793 --> 50:09.551
I'm here.
OK?

50:12.034 --> 50:13.931
It'll all seem better
in the morning.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.344
It's all my fault.

50:19.413 --> 50:20.965
No.

52:05.344 --> 52:07.068
Are you a smoker?

52:10.137 --> 52:11.448
No.

52:12.482 --> 52:13.758
Good girl.

52:16.620 --> 52:18.344
I just couldn't sleep,
so I thought

52:18.413 --> 52:22.689
I would go for a walk
and clear my head.

52:25.965 --> 52:27.827
That's dangerous.

52:28.551 --> 52:32.448
Attractive woman like yourself,
late at night.

52:46.724 --> 52:50.655
Still, I wouldn't want you
to feel like a prisoner.

52:56.413 --> 52:59.000
Give me a call if you
need me to pick you up.

53:03.241 --> 53:04.862
Thank you.

53:11.241 --> 53:13.137
Um, I'm sorry.
I--

53:13.206 --> 53:14.931
I didn't mean to listen,

53:15.000 --> 53:19.862
but I just heard what you said
to Shell before,

53:19.931 --> 53:21.275
about Joseph.

53:23.275 --> 53:24.517
- I don't--
- No, no.

53:24.586 --> 53:26.517
- I don't want to--
- No, it's--it's fine.

53:26.586 --> 53:28.551
- I don't--
- It's fine.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.586
Listen, it--

53:41.655 --> 53:44.137
He can't have died
how you think.

53:45.896 --> 53:47.310
That night,

53:47.379 --> 53:49.793
I carried you in here myself
before it happened.

53:49.862 --> 53:51.793
You couldn't even stand up.

53:53.034 --> 53:55.275
And he was still on deck,
alive.

53:55.344 --> 53:57.724
So there's no way
you pushed him.

54:07.103 --> 54:11.310
I have to be on watch
the whole night, so...

54:11.379 --> 54:13.241
I'm going to try
to sleep a bit.

54:17.034 --> 54:18.620
You should try the same.

54:32.965 --> 54:33.931
Fuck.

54:36.965 --> 54:38.206
How could you do this to me,

54:38.275 --> 54:40.206
when you knew
what I was going through?

54:40.275 --> 54:43.068
What?
Wait, do what?

54:44.620 --> 54:50.275
You--you told me that I--

54:50.344 --> 54:53.137
pushed Joseph when I didn't.

54:56.379 --> 55:01.862
I--
look, hey.

55:01.931 --> 55:05.344
Kitty, it's OK.

55:05.413 --> 55:07.448
You're confused.
OK?

55:07.517 --> 55:10.034
Don't touch me!

55:12.034 --> 55:15.000
OK.

55:15.068 --> 55:16.862
I'm not touching you.

55:18.103 --> 55:19.758
See?

55:22.655 --> 55:24.310
It's OK.

55:39.241 --> 55:42.068
It was you.

56:12.758 --> 56:14.068
Lana.

56:14.137 --> 56:16.413
I need to talk to you.

56:16.482 --> 56:17.551
All right.

56:17.620 --> 56:19.413
Come in.

56:19.482 --> 56:21.344
You were right.
He's lying.

56:21.413 --> 56:24.310
Denny's lying about everything
and I think he's dangerous,

56:24.379 --> 56:27.379
so I need your help.

56:27.448 --> 56:29.758
I'm going to have a drink.
Do you want one?

56:29.827 --> 56:30.827
Yes.

56:30.896 --> 56:32.448
Yeah, fuck it.
I'll have one.

56:34.931 --> 56:37.275
Police! Police!

57:56.931 --> 57:58.448
Last location.

58:13.137 --> 58:14.827
Sir...

59:01.172 --> 59:03.482
It's very brave
for you to come here.

59:03.551 --> 59:05.517
Thanks.

59:05.586 --> 59:08.000
But you don't have
to worry anymore.

59:10.344 --> 59:12.137
I can help.

59:12.206 --> 59:14.103
Ah.

59:15.517 --> 59:21.586
Now tell me everything.
