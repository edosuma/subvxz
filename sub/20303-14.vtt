NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:04.462 --> 00:05.714
(screams)

00:07.716 --> 00:09.300
I'll live. No thanks to you.

00:09.384 --> 00:12.470
You know, I don't understand
how some half-baked political gig

00:12.554 --> 00:14.723
can be more important to you
than your own partner.

00:14.806 --> 00:17.976
Worst kind of black man is one who dumps
on his people, and that's you.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.731
You... and Mrs. Gardner?

00:22.814 --> 00:25.567
She gave me leather sheets
for my birthday.

00:25.650 --> 00:30.196
I suppose it was a sort of
postmortem libidinal urge.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.032
I mean, here I am,
the newest member of W.A.D.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.993
-W.A.D.?
-Women Against Discrimination.

00:35.076 --> 00:38.204
We're staging our first sit-in
at Chief Daniels' office on Wednesday.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.165
I received a call from Jerry Fuchs.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.000
He said you missed your meet last night.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.419
I got another meet set in 45 minutes.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.463
Better not be jacking us up
on this one, J.D.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.339
I don't want to be walking
into a shootin' gallery.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.260
Hey, good buddy. Okay.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.138
-You wanna wire me for some AM/FM?
-He's drunk.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.056
According to ballistics,

00:56.139 --> 00:58.600
Miss Gilliam was shot
with a .45 automatic.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.977
I'm scared, Frank. I'm really scared.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.062
We'll get him, Joyce.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.773
Hold it right there. Freeze!

01:05.607 --> 01:07.484
JOYCE: Don't let this one get away, Frank.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.445
I want his head on a stake
in the middle of Dekker Avenue.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.489
As of now, we have no case.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.575
You mean this guy could actually walk?

01:15.658 --> 01:18.578
They lost the memo in a drawer,
and those animals are gonna walk?

01:18.661 --> 01:21.081
FRANK: Joyce, there's gonna be justice
for Pam Gilliam.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.210
(chattering, laughing)

01:33.426 --> 01:35.011
-Item ten.
-RENKO: Sarge?

01:39.390 --> 01:40.934
-Thanks.
-ESTERHAUS: Item ten.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.645
As many of you are no doubt aware,

01:43.728 --> 01:45.980
there's been a $50,000 reward

01:46.314 --> 01:48.650
offered by
the Friends of Pam Gilliam Foundation

01:48.733 --> 01:52.195
for information leading to the arrest
and conviction of her killers.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.782
Needless to say, the station phone lines
have been jammed

01:55.865 --> 01:57.826
with would-be informants
and creative testimony

01:57.909 --> 01:59.619
ever since it hit the news last night.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.288
So, people, please,

02:02.372 --> 02:05.959
let's not burden an already crippled
telecommunication system

02:06.042 --> 02:09.629
with any recreational calls
these next few days.

02:09.712 --> 02:11.506
-What do you say, huh?
-(all chattering)

02:12.799 --> 02:15.218
ESTERHAUS: Item 11. Regarding meat.

02:15.927 --> 02:19.264
Due to a critical freezer breakdown
and in lieu of mass spoilage,

02:19.347 --> 02:22.100
the Pieri Brothers packing plant on Bailey

02:22.183 --> 02:25.687
will be discounting
nearly 4,000 pounds of top sirloin...

02:25.770 --> 02:27.981
-(man whoops)
-...to 18 cents a pound.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.567
-WOMAN: Eighteen cents!
-(clapping)

02:30.650 --> 02:33.653
The current economic doldrums
considered...

02:33.736 --> 02:34.571
COFFEY: Hey, why don't we get some?

02:34.821 --> 02:38.658
...sort of carnal hysteria
that could reign down there this morning.

02:39.868 --> 02:40.952
In anticipation of which,

02:41.035 --> 02:44.038
the following officers
shall be assigned to crowd control.

02:44.330 --> 02:49.002
-Coley, Lyle, Walsh, Tubbs.
-(laughter)

02:49.919 --> 02:51.129
ESTERHAUS: The final item.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.841
Uh, it appears "Bust of the Month" honors

02:54.924 --> 02:57.093
are due Officers LaRue and Washington...

02:58.303 --> 03:00.930
for their featured roles
in last night's raid

03:01.014 --> 03:03.641
on that PCP laboratory on Delaware.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.977
-WOMAN: All right.
-ESTERHAUS: Resulting, I might add,

03:06.060 --> 03:07.562
in five airtight arrests

03:07.645 --> 03:09.856
and the seizure of a considerable quantity

03:09.939 --> 03:12.400
of lethal, mind-altering substances.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.154
Quota-wise, society-wise
and parental concern-wise,

03:16.237 --> 03:18.323
a peer group tip of the hat, gentlemen.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.325
-Nice bust.
-(applauding, cheering)

03:21.910 --> 03:23.786
ESTERHAUS:
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.121
And, hey. Hey.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.916
Let's be careful out there.

03:30.001 --> 03:30.877
HILL: That's great, J.D.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.879
-MAN: Okay. Let's get 'em.
-MAN 2: Let's go.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.469
Neal. Neal, man. Come on.
Wait up a minute, huh?

03:39.552 --> 03:41.930
Ain't nothin' to talk about, J.D.
I got paperwork to finish.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.057
-No, no. Furillo find out anything yet?
-Hey, look, man.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.184
If that's all you're worried about,
I didn't say a word.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.518
RENKO: Well, partner, I tell ya.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.020
I don't want you to get a swollen head
or anything,

03:49.103 --> 03:51.314
but I've been missin' you out there
those last few days.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.732
(shouting)

03:56.236 --> 03:57.111
Excuse me.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.739
-You want an apple?
-No. Give me a big ol' cookie.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.367
-I guess what I'm trying to say is this.
-(choking)

04:03.243 --> 04:05.328
-Do you mind?
-BATES: He's choking!

04:05.703 --> 04:09.540
I don't really mind your foolin' around
with this Afro-American political gig

04:09.624 --> 04:11.626
as long as you're loyal to auld lang syne.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.461
No more sermons. Okay, Renko?

04:14.921 --> 04:17.590
-(grunting)
-Lean him back, Joe. Come on.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.177
(coughs)

04:25.765 --> 04:29.269
It's gettin' so you can't hardly have
a decent conversation around here no more.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.729
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:32.188 --> 04:33.856
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:33.940 --> 04:37.652
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:37.735 --> 04:39.529
(sirens wailing)

04:44.993 --> 04:48.913
(theme music playing)

05:56.230 --> 05:58.399
Excuse me, ma'am, but I fail to see

05:58.483 --> 06:01.152
how that incriminated your husband
in Miss Gilliam's death.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.945
(woman on phone shouting)

06:03.905 --> 06:06.449
Look, lady, why don't you just take it
to a marriage counselor?

06:06.532 --> 06:08.493
We are trying to run
an investigation here.

06:09.285 --> 06:10.661
Hill Street. Detective Goldblume speaking.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.831
CALLETANO: We have established that you
were allegedly at the scene of the crime.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.958
All right, sir. What did you see?

06:16.501 --> 06:20.171
In what sort of vehicle did you see the
assailants leave the scene of the crime?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.340
-It was, uh, a Ford.
-A Chevy.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.884
Bates. Coffey.

06:25.968 --> 06:29.222
We got a domestic-mayhem situation.
416 Lynwood.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.599
-Let's roll, shall we?
-Got it covered, Sarge.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.153
-You wanted to see me, Captain?
-Sit down, J.D.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.125
I commit over a dozen men, two precincts

06:57.208 --> 07:01.712
and nearly $80,000
to a major-league operation,

07:01.796 --> 07:05.591
the safe execution of which
is almost entirely in your hands,

07:05.675 --> 07:08.094
and you show up plastered to the gills.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.181
I'm sick about it, Captain.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.643
Hell, I walked the streets
until almost 6:00 this morning.

07:16.686 --> 07:20.857
-Hey. You think I wanted this to happen?
-In a sense, yes, I do.

07:22.191 --> 07:25.611
I went from a fifth a day to nearly seven
months of straight sobriety out there.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.071
And I mean not a drop.

07:27.488 --> 07:30.825
It was just in the last couple of weeks,
things started closin' in on me.

07:30.908 --> 07:31.742
I don't know.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.122
I'm in your hands, okay? No-- no favors.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.708
But you, of all people,

07:38.791 --> 07:40.334
-should understand how hard--
-I don't wanna hear it, J.D.!

07:40.418 --> 07:42.420
As of this moment,
pending an investigation,

07:42.503 --> 07:44.046
you're assigned to the motor pool.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.936
Captain. Is there anything I can say--

07:59.020 --> 08:01.814
I suggest you make plans
for another career, J.D.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.109
I am going to personally recommend
your dismissal from the force.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.167
-(pounding)
-MAN 1: I'll teach you to mess around

08:21.250 --> 08:23.044
with married women, you little creep!

08:23.628 --> 08:25.087
-Luce. Luce, wait a minute.
-MAN 1: I'll kill him!

08:25.171 --> 08:26.672
Why don't we let somebody else
handle this?

08:26.756 --> 08:28.257
What are you talkin' about?
We're here already.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.426
I-- It's a routine domestic.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.220
Let 'em work it out themselves. Come on.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.639
Joe, how are they gonna work it out?
They gonna kill each other?

08:34.722 --> 08:37.225
Forget about it. Police! Open up!

08:37.308 --> 08:38.559
MAN 1: Come on out of there!

08:38.893 --> 08:41.020
Luce, I think there's something I should
tell you before you go in there.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.105
-What?
-Help! He's gonna kill him!

08:43.189 --> 08:46.234
-(man continues shouting)
-Joey? What are you doin' here?

08:46.317 --> 08:47.860
-MAN 2: Help! Police!
-MAN 1: I'll kill him!

08:47.944 --> 08:49.111
-Hold it!
-You're not the first guy

08:49.195 --> 08:51.322
-she's brought home.
-Okay, what's goin' on here?

08:51.405 --> 08:52.406
Well, you oughta know.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.243
Your partner here was the last crumb
I caught up here!

08:55.326 --> 08:56.202
MAN 2: Who's out there?

08:56.285 --> 08:58.829
This is the little cookie
that you stood me up for?

08:58.913 --> 09:00.665
Look, I told you
I had somethin' to tell you.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.750
And I didn't wanna take this call
in the first place.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.168
Yeah? Long as you're here,

09:04.252 --> 09:05.378
maybe you'd like a little taste
of what you got last time--

09:05.461 --> 09:06.879
-Hey! Relax!
-COFFEY: All right! That's it!

09:07.338 --> 09:08.464
-MAN 2: What's going on?
-Now, look,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.049
you got two choices here.

09:10.841 --> 09:14.428
Either we sit down and discuss this thing
like mature adults,

09:14.637 --> 09:16.138
or I'm just gonna run
the whole lot of you in.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.224
-There's nothin' to discuss anymore.
-(man 2 knocking)

09:18.307 --> 09:20.142
-Is it okay to come out now?
-COFFEY: Well, try.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.439
That's all I been doin' is tryin'.
I can't live with this rage,

09:25.523 --> 09:27.942
I got tearin' at my insides.

09:28.025 --> 09:33.197
Rage? You're the one that wanted
an open marriage. Not me.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.784
Or have you forgotten that weekend
at the shore with the Kolodneys?

09:36.867 --> 09:38.327
Open marriage is one thing.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.788
It's gettin'
I oughta put in a ticket booth here.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.708
I don't know. Maybe I'm askin' for it.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.835
Using Heather's infidelities

09:45.918 --> 09:49.005
to reaffirm
my own deep-rooted hostilities.

09:49.088 --> 09:53.301
You see, deep down, I always blamed her
for me not getting into dental college.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.427
Me?

09:55.136 --> 09:56.804
You didn't get into dental college

09:56.887 --> 09:59.390
because you flunked out
of correspondence school,

09:59.473 --> 10:01.225
you big, impotent dummy!

10:01.309 --> 10:03.603
-Who you callin' a dummy?
-I'm callin' you--

10:03.686 --> 10:05.229
(shouting, grunting)

10:05.313 --> 10:06.897
(all groaning)

10:13.529 --> 10:15.323
-I hope you're right.
-Three hot dogs, please.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.449
I hope so too, man.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.618
You want anything on 'em?

10:18.701 --> 10:21.954
Uh, mustard and kraut on mine. Bill?

10:22.163 --> 10:25.333
Uh, mustard and onion. Hold the kraut.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.127
-And a club soda.
-And give me a diet cola.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.047
Uh, hold the onions. A little mustard.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.716
Oh, and heavy on the kraut.
Let me have an orange too.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.636
Ah, on second thought,
the kraut looks good.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.804
A little of that and no onion.

10:39.764 --> 10:43.351
Hey, you got that, uh, dark mustard
or that yellow stuff?

10:43.434 --> 10:45.311
You wanna steam the bun a little bit more
for me, would ya?

10:45.394 --> 10:48.564
-Yeah, give me a diet cola.
-You got any relish?

10:49.899 --> 10:51.651
MAN:
Relish. Wait a minute. That's what I want.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.944
Forget the other stuff and just give me
relish on it.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.622
You expect me to eat this now?

11:05.581 --> 11:06.957
(growling)

11:07.792 --> 11:09.335
This is on the house, fellas.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.254
-Now scram.
-MAN 2: Come on. Let's get outta here.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.466
-That's affirmative action, brother.
-MAN: I can't believe--

11:19.553 --> 11:21.347
You got a match
for a filter-tipped cigarette?

11:22.056 --> 11:23.933
Sorry. They're in my back pocket.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.644
-Where's the cash?
-Where's the stuff?

11:29.397 --> 11:30.314
Your turn, baby.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.441
Come here.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.616
The money's hot. It's a joke.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.580
Make me one of those hot dogs
while you're at it, will ya?

11:46.664 --> 11:49.959
Oh, you're the hot dog, hairball.
You're under arrest.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.045
(growling)

11:58.676 --> 11:59.885
MAN: Hey, look out!

12:10.396 --> 12:12.732
-(chattering, shouting)
-(screams)

12:27.079 --> 12:28.706
You want I should call a cop?

12:29.874 --> 12:30.791
(sighs)

12:34.211 --> 12:37.006
-(phone ringing)
-Look, I'd understand if you wanna hit.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.050
-I probably deserve it.
-Do it. Hit him. Hit him!

12:40.134 --> 12:42.470
-Knock it off, or I'll pop ya.
-Lucy, will you shut up?

12:42.553 --> 12:44.096
-You're takin' a lot of space up, big boy.
-Big stooge.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.473
-Carries his unconscious libido

12:45.556 --> 12:47.099
-in his fists.
-Come on.

12:47.183 --> 12:51.729
I had an escrow closing at 1:00. My boss
is gonna kill me. Not to mention my wife.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.273
Mr. Vosca, I'm gonna put you on hold
for just a second.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.484
Please stay on the line.
I'll be right back.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.069
Frank, I got an interesting one here.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.613
Cabbie, says he saw the whole thing
go down.

13:00.696 --> 13:01.655
I think it's legit.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.324
Okay. Follow it up.

13:05.075 --> 13:09.246
Mr. Vosca, could you meet me down there?
Let's say 15 minutes?

13:09.997 --> 13:10.831
Great.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.722
(sighs)

13:31.477 --> 13:33.938
Are you still concerned
about that dealer getting away?

13:34.021 --> 13:36.857
Forget it, Sarge. I don't wanna hold
no press conferences about it.

13:36.941 --> 13:40.277
Oh, lighten up, Mick.
It happens to us all.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.864
-Uh-uh. I should've had him.
-(locker clatters)

13:43.948 --> 13:47.409
-I'm gettin' old. I'm losin' my chops.
-Oh.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.621
Now, there's no need
for pathetic recriminations, Detective.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.873
You're just starting
that part of your life

13:52.957 --> 13:57.169
where quality replaces the blind,
youthful grab of quantity.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.338
And I gotta tell you that you,

13:59.421 --> 14:01.590
you held down the fort longer than most.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.970
Change overtakes us all, Mick,
and it can crop up anywhere.

14:06.804 --> 14:10.057
As for me, personally,
it was first apparent in, uh,

14:10.683 --> 14:12.768
matters of sexual management.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.730
HUNTER: The testosterone peaks and then
starts a diminishing-sequence curve,

14:16.814 --> 14:17.815
and then you're out.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.652
Oh, sure, I was troubled
the first few times it happened, but, uh,

14:22.528 --> 14:25.739
you know, Mick, you've never really seen
the sun come up with a woman...

14:25.948 --> 14:29.285
until you've done it
sans the basic motivation.

14:29.660 --> 14:34.081
Yeah, your bull chimp can hold down
the hierarchy for, uh, till he's 25.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.543
You know, your Cape buffalo, damn near 40.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.963
And humans? Well, it's common knowledge...

14:41.046 --> 14:45.092
that your tropical types burn out faster
than your glacial, European man.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.345
Still, the day comes...

14:48.971 --> 14:51.974
when the mustard
just doesn't cut the same way.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.733
You know, the Visigoths
venerated their old warriors.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.484
They had a festival each spring,

15:02.568 --> 15:04.820
and they honored them for their wisdom

15:04.904 --> 15:07.281
and their ethereal place in society.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.828
Then they trampled them
under a herd of oxen, the barbarians.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.666
(sighs)

15:20.044 --> 15:21.378
(footsteps approaching)

15:36.518 --> 15:37.353
Hello, Grace.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.065
I'm wearing your favorite, Phil.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.817
Eau de Sade.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.993
You once said that it put you
all out of control.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.331
A weakness I share with Weimaraners,
it appears.

15:57.998 --> 16:01.877
Grace, if you've come
for some posthaste reconciliation,

16:02.586 --> 16:04.713
I'm not in a very forgiving mood
at the moment.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.218
I came to try to make you understand,
Phillip.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.847
The last thing I ever wanted
was to cause you any pain.

16:15.265 --> 16:19.812
But after exhausting every possible avenue
for my grievance,

16:20.479 --> 16:24.274
countless phone calls to my landlord,
the local precinct,

16:24.483 --> 16:26.568
that obnoxious little Buck Mullins.

16:27.695 --> 16:31.323
After enduring
nearly four sleepless months

16:31.407 --> 16:33.534
of that dog's lovesick howling,

16:36.370 --> 16:38.247
you were my last resort, darling.

16:39.665 --> 16:43.627
How could you commingle
with that sordid little wretch?

16:44.128 --> 16:46.922
Phillip,
it happened before I ever met you.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.383
Chronology notwithstanding,

16:50.300 --> 16:52.302
I think sometimes...

16:52.803 --> 16:57.141
you don't really know me at all.

17:00.936 --> 17:05.357
I don't often spend four days
in a one-man tent

17:05.441 --> 17:07.276
with total strangers, Freemason.

17:07.818 --> 17:11.238
Oh, I admit we share
a certain physical attraction.

17:12.072 --> 17:15.409
And I won't deny a certain fascination
with your multipurpose lotions,

17:15.492 --> 17:17.536
your handsomely-illustrated manuals,

17:17.953 --> 17:20.497
your weekends at the shore,<i> au naturel.</i>

17:20.831 --> 17:23.125
But I have other needs as well, Grace.

17:24.126 --> 17:28.130
A pipe, my slippers by the hearth,
two sets of teeth.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.548
Teeth?

17:29.631 --> 17:33.260
In matching glasses by the sink,
as it were.

17:33.552 --> 17:37.765
-I don't think I follow.
-Old age, Grace. Senior citizenry.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.933
Decline and fall.
The far side of the mountain.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.144
It's not so far away, you know.

17:42.978 --> 17:46.231
And what use will tangerine-flavored
body creams be to us then?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.486
It does give one food for thought.

17:53.572 --> 17:57.534
Grace, I know you see in me
some blue-clad symbol...

17:58.285 --> 17:59.536
of male sensuality.

18:00.829 --> 18:04.750
But underneath this gabardine exterior,

18:04.833 --> 18:07.795
beats the heart of a simple man...

18:08.545 --> 18:11.840
with strong domestic desires.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.259
Grace,

18:16.011 --> 18:17.679
I have to know, once and for all,

18:18.597 --> 18:20.265
in the twilight years,

18:21.433 --> 18:25.562
when the blaze has reduced to embers,

18:26.396 --> 18:27.856
will we still be together?

18:29.024 --> 18:31.777
Semper "fidelitas"?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.320
Side by side?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.951
Phillip Freemason Esterhaus.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.831
Are you asking what I think you're asking?

18:46.333 --> 18:49.878
Oh. That's a good question. (chuckles)

18:50.629 --> 18:52.464
I-- I mean, I don't really know.

18:53.674 --> 18:54.508
(chuckles)

18:56.343 --> 19:00.264
I'm gonna have to give this...
some thought, Grace.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.267
Take all the time you need, Phillip.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.954
Is there any reason
you were parked across the street

19:24.037 --> 19:25.497
the night of the shooting, Mr. Vosca?

19:25.581 --> 19:29.960
Yeah. I just dropped off a fare, like,
four blocks away on the corner of Utica.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.086
And, uh...

19:32.129 --> 19:35.465
Well... (sighs) See, I got
this bladder problem, you see?

19:35.549 --> 19:38.594
And, um, I didn't spot
any gas stations handy,

19:38.677 --> 19:40.304
so I made a pit stop in the alley.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.890
Well, any port in a storm, right?

19:44.266 --> 19:45.100
Mm.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.312
I was just gettin' back into my cab
when it all went down.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.732
I assume your trip sheet for Tuesday night
will place you

19:51.815 --> 19:54.026
-in the neighborhood at that hour.
-Yeah-- No, no.

19:54.109 --> 19:57.070
Because, you see,
I was high-flaggin' the Utica fare.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.197
-Off the company records.
-Yeah.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.117
The guy waved me down from a bus stop
on Hurdle, and I was between radio calls.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.871
So, I figure, what, might as well pick up
some spare cash on a flat fare.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.582
Why'd you wait till now to come forward?

20:09.041 --> 20:10.792
Well, I was worried about losin' my job,

20:10.876 --> 20:13.337
you know, if they found out
I was high-flaggin' and all.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.547
And by then, you guys had made arrests.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.008
(exhales) I don't know.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.344
When you had to let him go,
you know, something--

20:20.427 --> 20:22.429
It just-- It started gettin' to me.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.806
Her death or the reward?

20:26.183 --> 20:27.517
Well, both, I guess.

20:29.895 --> 20:30.938
What were they wearing?

20:31.647 --> 20:33.941
I'm pretty sure the shooter
was wearin', like, jeans,

20:34.024 --> 20:37.027
a gray sweatshirt
and, uh, black high-tops.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.863
And then the other kid had on,
what, a brown leather jacket.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.116
-How about the car?
-Aha. Two-tone Chevy.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.827
'62 Impala, I think.

20:46.161 --> 20:50.082
With, uh, kind of like a dent
on the right-front panel.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.043
It was black or dark blue with a white top

20:53.126 --> 20:55.629
and, uh, (exclaims)
white pinstriping, you know.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.383
Now, it was missin'--
It was missin' the front plate.

20:59.466 --> 21:03.470
But I got, uh, I got
the first three digits from the rear,

21:03.553 --> 21:05.472
you know,
when they went tearin' outta here.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.393
This cabbie's the real thing, Frank.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.728
As far as I can tell, you couldn't ask
for a better witness.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.231
Keep in mind, Henry, as far as media leaks
are concerned,

21:14.314 --> 21:16.942
this case hasn't been exactly
a model of discretion.

21:17.025 --> 21:19.027
Uh-uh, Frank. I grilled him on stuff

21:19.111 --> 21:22.531
half our forensic guys
didn't even have access to, straight A's.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.618
Okay. Chart his sight time
and all distances involved,

21:26.702 --> 21:27.536
then bring him in.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.956
I'll send Hill and Renko out
to pull in Bragg and Harmon.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.916
<i>-Nice going, Henry.</i>
-Yeah.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.712
You know,
if that barbecue turns out all right,

21:36.795 --> 21:38.755
maybe I'll make it
into a weekly type thing--

21:39.172 --> 21:42.634
your basic all-American,
family Sunday dinner.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.719
Each and every week.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.222
Me, Trace, Tommy and Dad.

21:48.390 --> 21:51.018
You know, for a while there, I was about
to write the whole thing off as hopeless,

21:51.101 --> 21:52.227
but now I think things are different.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.646
I think this family's gonna get itself
back together.

21:56.189 --> 21:59.401
You know what burns me up the most
about this whole Coalition situation?

22:00.736 --> 22:03.780
I got Vernon Lee, Clay Matthews
and five dozen other guys

22:03.864 --> 22:07.409
just breathin' down my neck,
waitin' for me to screw up.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.911
And I didn't even ask for the damn job.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.497
You didn't hear a word I said, did you?

22:13.832 --> 22:16.293
-What?
-I said you did not hear a word I said,

22:16.376 --> 22:18.378
-did you?
-Yeah, sure, I did, Renko.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.173
You-- you were talkin' about
the, uh, the barbecue.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.841
I hope you make it in politics, pal,

22:22.924 --> 22:24.718
'cause you're sure not
cuttin' it in the real world.

22:24.801 --> 22:25.677
It's right here.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.518
Don't tell me about the real world.
I already know about the real world.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.438
Dream on, tuna. If you knew anything
about the real world,

22:36.521 --> 22:38.690
you never would've gotten messed up
in this bush-league

22:38.774 --> 22:40.942
racial lobby of yours in the first place.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.944
Racial lobby? You don't know
the first thing about it.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.531
I'm sorry, Robert, but I think we can just
stop this conversation right now.

22:46.865 --> 22:50.660
Baby, this dust of his
was bad enough to stop traffic.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.829
-(footsteps climbing stairs)
-And I asked about Curtis.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.582
He said, "The last time I saw Curtis,

22:55.665 --> 22:58.710
he was runnin' naked down Elwood Av--"

22:58.794 --> 23:00.629
-(man shouts)
-(shouting)

23:02.756 --> 23:04.216
Hey! Freeze right there!

23:04.841 --> 23:07.260
Now back up. Put your hands up high,
right above your head.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.220
All right,
get up against the wall right now.

23:08.303 --> 23:09.763
Hey, man, this is bogus.

23:09.846 --> 23:10.931
-Did I ask you to talk?
-You ain't got nothin' on me.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.350
-Did I ask you to talk?
-You ain't got nothin' on me, man!

23:17.437 --> 23:19.022
Okay. I'm a drunk.

23:20.982 --> 23:21.942
I tried to quit.

23:23.151 --> 23:23.985
I couldn't.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.614
And because I'm a drunk, I'm a liar.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.157
And nobody trusts a liar.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.829
(exhales) I lost my partner.

23:35.705 --> 23:36.915
I'm...

23:38.417 --> 23:40.043
I'm probably gonna lose my job.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.004
(exhales)

23:44.840 --> 23:45.799
I'm scared.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.595
I've never been so scared
in my life, Doctor.

23:51.888 --> 23:54.975
I'm scared to go to work.
I'm scared to go home.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.645
(panting)

23:58.979 --> 24:00.439
I'm scared to be with a woman.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.193
I'm scared to be here.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.280
I need help.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.659
And-- and if-- If I don't get help now,

24:12.742 --> 24:13.952
I'm gonna die.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.497
And-- and I don't wanna die.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.666
(crying) Please, God.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.377
Please, God! (sobbing)

24:22.461 --> 24:24.921
Please. Don't let me die.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.718
All the way to the end, gentlemen,
and please face front.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.600
GOLDBLUME:
Uncross your arms, please, number five.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.815
Take your time, Mr. Vosca.
Be absolutely sure.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.276
Huh. Yeah, that's them, all right.

24:47.068 --> 24:50.864
Number five was drivin'. And, uh,
number three, he was the shooter.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.328
-You're sure?
-Yeah. I'm positive.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.207
Okay, Henry.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.250
Thank you. Move 'em out.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.378
You know, he could've seen their pictures
in the papers.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.630
Yeah, but the paper didn't say anything

25:06.713 --> 25:08.465
about who drove
and who pulled the trigger.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.342
FURILLO:
Thank you for your help, Mr. Vosca.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.553
If you will, give your signed statement
to Lieutenant Calletano here.

25:13.637 --> 25:14.471
Yeah, sure.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.183
CALLETANO: Neal, please get the forms,
and we'll take his statement.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.392
Well, uh,

25:21.311 --> 25:22.687
maybe we have a case after all.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.403
Francis, we got 'em back-to-back.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.738
Oh, good. Thanks, Phil.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.115
Let's start at the bottom.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.076
(door opens)

25:37.994 --> 25:39.204
You got something more to say to us?

25:39.287 --> 25:42.707
A confession is being typed up.
We'd like Mr. Harmon to sign it.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.377
Captain, we heard the "rubber hose"
monologue last Tuesday.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.628
Can we get down to business?

25:46.711 --> 25:48.922
The individual who identified your client

25:49.005 --> 25:52.092
has put him at the scene
with a smoking revolver.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.761
-I'd like to see the details, please.
-FURILLO: You will.

25:54.844 --> 25:58.223
But don't tire me out.
Neither one of us has a lot of time.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.140
BERNSTEIN: Frank.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.353
What Captain Furillo is saying

26:03.436 --> 26:06.398
is that emotions are running particularly
high in this incident.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.068
The convicted killer of Pam Gilliam
is looking at life without parole.

26:10.485 --> 26:11.903
Give us a signed confession today,

26:12.487 --> 26:14.906
the D.A.'s office will recommend
no more than 25 to life.

26:15.490 --> 26:16.408
Full guarantees?

26:18.660 --> 26:20.704
I'd like to discuss this
with my client, please.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.122
HARMON: Who you kiddin', jack?

26:22.330 --> 26:24.374
You got somethin', you prove it.

26:24.624 --> 26:27.419
I ain't doin' 25 years for nobody!

26:29.504 --> 26:32.924
We're asking again. We want testimony
against Wilbur Harmon.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.552
-My client's told you--
-I said to stick it!

26:35.635 --> 26:39.848
Be sensible, Tyler. We can get you
12 to 16. You'll be out in eight.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.851
Oh, man. Before, you was sayin' three.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.311
That's right. That was before.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.479
We have a witness now, a good one.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.648
Harmon's going into cold storage.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.984
If we want, we can drop you
right in beside him.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.652
It's a different picture, Tyler.

26:53.236 --> 26:56.323
You're in deep, and you're gonna have
to work hard to climb out.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.742
-I really must insist that--
-Shut up!

27:01.745 --> 27:02.579
You know somethin'?

27:03.872 --> 27:07.751
If it's so airtight, how come
you wanna make a deal with me?

27:08.251 --> 27:11.087
Oh, we don't care about you, Bragg.
We're after your friend.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.883
-Do yourself a favor.
-You don't get nothin' from me...

27:15.592 --> 27:17.802
unless you go back to the original deal.

27:18.261 --> 27:21.389
That's what I need, the original deal.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.351
My, look at you.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.562
You're really trembling, aren't you?

27:28.980 --> 27:30.857
I've never seen anything like it.
Have you?

27:33.943 --> 27:36.237
-How badly do you need him?
-I need him.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.490
One witness, even a good one,

27:38.573 --> 27:40.492
is like trying to tie your shoe
with one hand.

27:40.575 --> 27:44.537
Look, I know he's garbage, but we may
wanna give him what we offered before.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.374
-Let's not move too fast.
-Facts of life, Frank.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.959
The press, the public, even my office,

27:50.043 --> 27:52.003
doesn't care about Bragg
as long as we get the shooter.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.589
I just don't wanna end up
holding an empty bag, you know?

27:54.923 --> 27:57.175
I understand,
but let's bury Harmon at least.

27:58.134 --> 27:58.968
We done?

28:00.261 --> 28:01.930
I'm gonna take 'em both back downtown.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.057
Send me the cabbie's statement
when it's in.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.434
I could use some decent bedtime reading.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.188
I'm almost afraid to ask.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.232
It's true.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.862
The reward brought in a cabbie
who says he saw it all.

28:18.488 --> 28:19.322
Thank God.

28:20.448 --> 28:22.534
-Can he make the case?
-We'll see.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.327
But it looks good, right?

28:27.372 --> 28:29.416
Frank, I'm sorry I've been so desperate.

28:29.833 --> 28:33.420
It's just that I was so afraid the system
wasn't going to work for us on this one.

28:33.920 --> 28:37.382
-It is, isn't it?
-Yeah. About 50,000 dollars' worth.

28:43.888 --> 28:44.723
Joe?

28:46.141 --> 28:47.809
I, uh, I gotta talk to you, Joe.

28:48.935 --> 28:49.769
About what?

28:51.271 --> 28:53.857
We shared somethin' together once, Joe.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.026
Right. Once. That's the key word, once.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.696
You were the best. I have been around.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.782
I have been looking, and, believe me,

29:02.866 --> 29:04.784
you are the best.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.536
I-- I believe you. I believe you.

29:06.619 --> 29:09.330
Hey, don't-- don't worry about Bruno.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.958
He's still in.
I came to bail him out, but...

29:12.709 --> 29:14.377
I thought, maybe before...

29:15.295 --> 29:17.630
Oh, you animal.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.800
How about tonight, Joe? After you get off.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.927
-I can't.
-Oh, Joe.

29:23.219 --> 29:24.554
You took me someplace.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.598
You took me someplace
no one else ever did.

29:26.681 --> 29:29.225
-And only you can take me back there.
-ESTERHAUS: Young lady.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.644
Young lady, please,
this is a restricted area.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.816
Oh. You got my number, Joe.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.326
I got your number, Buffy.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.870
And don't you forget it.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.583
Mm-mm! Animal magnetism.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.211
I empathize, Joseph.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.134
(indistinct chattering)

30:07.222 --> 30:09.933
Bobby, there's a man to see you,
uh, in the squad room somewhere.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.893
-Who?
-Black badge, Midtown.

30:13.269 --> 30:14.604
-All right. Thanks, Leo.
-Sure.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.530
You look like a major leaguer here,
don't you?

30:26.491 --> 30:28.535
-MAN: Can I get some help here?
-What do you want?

30:29.077 --> 30:30.161
I said what do you want?

30:31.120 --> 30:33.206
Um, look, about yesterday...

30:34.457 --> 30:35.834
we can't afford that kind of baby stuff.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.795
You were doing your job,
and I was interfering.

30:39.587 --> 30:40.672
I apologize.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.757
Thank you for your honesty.

30:43.883 --> 30:47.011
The only thing that matters to me
is that you take our position seriously.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.556
I do take it seriously, Vern. I told you.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.228
Look, I've been around longer than you,
man, and I've seen it happen before.

30:55.311 --> 30:58.314
Six weeks to promotions.
If we don't have a big push on,

30:58.398 --> 31:00.608
something with some real teeth
and numbers,

31:00.692 --> 31:02.569
our guys are gonna get passed right over.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.071
Vern, this is how it is for me, okay?

31:05.989 --> 31:07.949
I got you in one ear sayin' one thing,

31:08.032 --> 31:10.410
and I got Ozzie Cleveland in the other
sayin' something else.

31:10.493 --> 31:12.620
And I don't know who's right. I'd like to.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.915
It would make it a lot easier right now
if I did know, but I don't know.

31:16.583 --> 31:17.667
Can you respect that?

31:21.129 --> 31:23.756
You wanna be stuck at patrolman
for the rest of your life?

31:25.133 --> 31:27.969
I don't know what I wanna be
for the rest of my life, Vern.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.930
But for right now, yes,
I like being a street cop,

31:31.014 --> 31:32.348
if you can believe that.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.184
So just let me do my job, all right?

31:40.023 --> 31:41.482
-Come on. We're goin' to Midtown.
-What's in Midtown?

31:41.566 --> 31:42.483
Ozzie Cleveland.

31:47.363 --> 31:49.657
FURILLO: Everything. Try everything.
Right. Later.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.660
-(receiver clatters)
-The cabbie's statement.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.121
Oh, my. He must have talked your ear off.

31:55.204 --> 31:57.457
-Is any of it holding up?
-You could say that.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.627
Faces, clothing, vehicle, time, place.

32:00.877 --> 32:03.546
He remembers everything,
just like we want it.

32:03.838 --> 32:07.091
Mm-hmm. Go on. Something else?

32:07.634 --> 32:08.843
(sighs) This guy.

32:09.135 --> 32:12.221
I mean, cops dream
about witnesses like this.

32:14.265 --> 32:18.311
Here. "Question:
'Was the suspect carrying a weapon?'

32:18.811 --> 32:23.191
Answer: 'Yeah. It looked like
a .45 automatic. Looked new too.'"

32:23.399 --> 32:26.402
From 30 yards, at night,
he gives us the weapon,

32:26.611 --> 32:28.696
the license plate, the sneakers.

32:29.364 --> 32:33.284
And look at those trip sheets.
I got them from the cab company.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.204
-You think he's been rehearsed, Ray?
-You tell me.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.623
All right. I don't want
that transcript going anywhere,

32:38.706 --> 32:40.583
our witness either,
not till I talk to him.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.461
-FURILLO: Who do you work for, Mr. Vosca?
-Mm.

32:44.545 --> 32:45.421
DOT Taxi.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.757
"When you gotta dash, go DOT." Huh?

32:47.840 --> 32:49.217
DOT doesn't work the Hill.

32:50.176 --> 32:53.554
We're well aware of the few cab companies
with enough guts to come up here.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.557
-DOT isn't one of them.
-Well, hey. Hey, some drivers do.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.394
I-- I told ya. I was off the meter.

32:59.936 --> 33:03.940
We examined your trip sheets for a week,
only two trips up to the Hill.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.275
Are you trying to tell us, Mr. Vosca,

33:06.359 --> 33:08.987
that after your meter goes off,
you rush right up here

33:09.070 --> 33:11.531
to provide needed taxi service
for residents of the ghetto?

33:11.614 --> 33:13.783
-(chuckling)
-Come off it, Mr. Vosca.

33:18.913 --> 33:19.998
What's goin' on here?

33:22.041 --> 33:24.836
I mean, you guys been so nice to me,
you know?

33:25.545 --> 33:29.590
You described detailing
on the perpetrators' jackets and pants

33:29.674 --> 33:32.385
and the model and even the caliber
of the murder weapon.

33:32.468 --> 33:37.265
Yet, you were 92 feet away,
viewing for no more than four seconds,

33:37.515 --> 33:39.600
under extreme hazard,

33:39.684 --> 33:42.895
a scene at least partially obscured
by parked cars

33:42.979 --> 33:44.731
and poorly lit at best.

33:44.814 --> 33:48.109
What can I tell ya?
I mean, I saw what I saw.

33:48.526 --> 33:52.613
You gave us three digits
off the rear license plate of the car.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.574
It happens that,
at the time of the shooting,

33:54.657 --> 33:56.909
that car was in violation
of the vehicle code.

33:56.993 --> 34:00.663
The light over the license plate was out.
Unlikely you saw even one digit.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.832
(sighing) Wow. Boy, this is--

34:02.915 --> 34:05.626
I mean-- This is amazing, you know?

34:06.711 --> 34:08.296
I thought you guys would be happy.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.636
Is that all you can say, Mr. Vosca?

34:18.431 --> 34:22.310
We're just the cops, buddy.
Square one on a long board.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.854
What in the hell do you think
your wonderful story's gonna sound like

34:24.937 --> 34:27.106
after three days of court testimony?

34:27.482 --> 34:29.901
After hearings, depositions,

34:29.984 --> 34:33.029
private investigations,
credit checks, polygraphs.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.407
You really think you can beat a polygraph?
A lot of people think they can these days.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.369
You're not going one step further, mister,
without one.

34:41.412 --> 34:43.915
No grand jury, no reward, not a penny.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.417
And if you flunk it,
we're gonna start investigating.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.961
And if it goes that far, God help you.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.256
Well, just, uh-- I'll get a lawyer.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.593
You're gonna need one.
You and whoever fed you that information.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.387
You're facing fraud, conspiracy,

34:58.471 --> 35:01.682
obstruction of justice,
attempted grand larceny.

35:02.016 --> 35:05.228
-Neal, find out who his accomplice is.
-Right, Captain.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.605
-(door opens)
-Yeah. Okay.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.820
-(door closes)
-Okay.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.448
We, uh, heard about the reward.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.368
My girlfriend, she's a...

35:21.410 --> 35:22.995
clerk typist downtown.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.250
-Police headquarters.
-(murmurs)

35:27.333 --> 35:31.629
She had all the papers on the guys.
I mean, mug shots even.

35:33.798 --> 35:34.757
We xeroxed them.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.513
Well-- Hey, you know,

35:40.596 --> 35:43.057
I just, uh, figured
everybody'd win, you know.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.226
I mean-- Yeah, all right,
we'd get the cash,

35:45.309 --> 35:49.647
and those, uh, animals
that killed that girl would get theirs.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.025
I mean, what kind of shame.
You guys can't even make that case.

35:53.109 --> 35:57.071
So, I figured you, you need a little help.

35:57.446 --> 35:59.490
-You call that help?
-Hey, now look!

36:03.870 --> 36:04.996
It's not my fault that...

36:06.622 --> 36:08.207
you guys can't put anybody away.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.585
-The name.
-Well--

36:10.668 --> 36:12.753
-The name!
-Mary Lopata.

36:13.921 --> 36:16.591
Call Division, Ray, and inform them.
Then call the D.A.'s office.

36:16.674 --> 36:20.553
Tell 'em I'm on the way and to hold off
sending Tyler Bragg in to the grand jury.

36:46.537 --> 36:47.914
Can I talk to you for a second?

36:48.748 --> 36:51.334
What is it? You heard about us
reoffering Bragg that deal.

36:51.417 --> 36:54.420
Look, Frank, it was a question
of pure pressure from upstairs.

36:54.503 --> 36:57.757
It's not that. It's the cabbie. He lied.
Turns out he's a complete phony.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.218
Mike.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.764
I was just taking him over to testify.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.724
It's your decision, but no cabbie.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.518
You know what our case is, Frank? Dead.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.689
The best I can do now is keep them both
in creative custody for six weeks.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.192
-Then they're out free.
-It's okay. Let 'em go now.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.695
At least, on the outside, there's always
a chance they'll slip up someplace else.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.239
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.991
I'm due at the urologist at 4:30.

37:26.702 --> 37:27.536
Move him out, Mike.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.665
You can take your client home,
Mr. Schwartz.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.542
-Huh?
-We're letting him go. Charges dropped.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.419
-Yeah?
-What's he sayin'?

37:37.296 --> 37:39.382
I got you off, kid. You can go.

37:42.468 --> 37:43.803
No kiddin'?

37:52.311 --> 37:53.562
(phone ringing)

38:00.736 --> 38:03.614
I'm resigning as vice president
of the Coalition, Ozzie.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.160
-I don't accept.
-I'm sorry. You have to.

38:11.580 --> 38:12.498
Let me guess.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.792
Your social life is a wreck,

38:15.376 --> 38:17.253
you're on the outs
with your white partner,

38:17.545 --> 38:19.672
you're suddenly the most unpopular guy
in the world.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.924
I support this organization, Ozzie.

38:22.008 --> 38:24.885
I pay dues to it,
but I'm not cut out to help run it.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.554
If everybody who felt like you
turned their backs

38:26.637 --> 38:28.973
on the additional responsibility
of making this thing go,

38:29.056 --> 38:30.474
nothing would ever happen for us.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.935
You can do it, Ozzie. And Vernon Lee.

38:33.561 --> 38:37.273
I may disagree with the man, but he's
a good, strong, committed politician.

38:37.648 --> 38:41.527
With me, Ozzie, it's like pounding
a round peg into a square hole.

38:43.904 --> 38:46.032
Why are you making this
so difficult for me?

38:46.490 --> 38:48.659
If I make it easy on you, I got nothing.

38:49.618 --> 38:50.828
We need you, Bobby.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.039
I can't do the job, Ozzie.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.459
All right, brother.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.462
Resignation accepted.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.340
(phone rings)

39:16.854 --> 39:17.980
So, did you tell him?

39:19.815 --> 39:21.859
-Yeah, I told him.
-Well, all right.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.277
I knew you'd see the light.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.529
-Because when it comes to hard-core...
-Let's get outta here, Renko.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.907
...commitment, what's happenin'
is right inside these wheels.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.159
Just me and you, partner. America's team,

39:30.242 --> 39:31.952
free, mobile and back in action.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.954
Damn it, Renko!
Would you shut up and drive.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.874
I've had it up to here
with all your rah-rah buddy routine.

39:36.957 --> 39:39.293
Routine? I'm talkin' about
friendship here, pal.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.046
Sometimes I don't think you even know
the meaning of the word.

39:42.838 --> 39:45.257
Since day one, Renko,
my stomach's been tied up in knots

39:45.341 --> 39:46.801
over this Coalition thing.

39:47.385 --> 39:51.639
If not support, the least I expected
from you was a little understanding.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.474
But, no. All I got from you

39:53.557 --> 39:56.894
was self-centered moaning
about your personal status quo.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.438
It's a two-way street, pal.

39:59.688 --> 40:03.025
I haven't exactly seen you breaking
a sweat over my personal problems.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.820
You mean with your family?
What's there to understand?

40:05.903 --> 40:08.197
You were tellin' me
everything is solid on that end.

40:13.619 --> 40:14.620
To tell you the truth,

40:16.497 --> 40:19.458
I don't think my old man could care less
if he ever saw me again.

40:21.877 --> 40:24.713
I didn't know that, Renko. You gotta tell
me these things.

40:24.797 --> 40:26.298
I can't read your mind.

40:27.466 --> 40:28.300
Why not?

40:29.051 --> 40:30.928
You been expecting me to read yours.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.771
(sighs) Look, Bobby.

40:42.314 --> 40:45.526
Maybe I've been gettin' down on you
for the last two weeks or so, but...

40:46.402 --> 40:47.528
it's just because, well,

40:49.113 --> 40:51.282
with all those outside interests
of yours...

40:53.117 --> 40:54.702
I guess I was afraid of, uh...

40:57.413 --> 40:58.247
of losin' you.

41:02.334 --> 41:04.753
I can't fill in for your family, cowboy.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.465
That's somethin' you'll have to work out
for yourself.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.510
But as far as this friendship goes, well,

41:13.304 --> 41:15.139
I'd say there's a few miles left on it.

41:21.103 --> 41:24.273
-(laughing)
-Let's get the hell outta here.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.818
(thunder rumbling)

41:31.197 --> 41:34.116
I was going through my address book today,
looking for a number,

41:34.200 --> 41:35.993
and I came across Pam Gilliam's.

41:37.870 --> 41:38.996
I just stared at it.

41:40.539 --> 41:43.417
It's like you expect those things
to vanish by themselves.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.462
But they're always there to remind you.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.341
(sighs)

41:53.677 --> 41:56.847
I'm so tired of being jerked around
by that murdering savage.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.391
-Joyce.
-I have to be honest about it, Frank.

41:59.475 --> 42:02.228
I want to see Harmon punished
to the absolute limit of the law.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.146
I want revenge for Pamela.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.613
Frank, I don't know
if I want to do my job anymore.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.323
I know that feeling.

42:14.573 --> 42:18.953
I can become a corporate lawyer or a D.A.
or go save the great outdoors.

42:19.036 --> 42:21.622
Or get married and have babies
in a house in the suburbs?

42:26.377 --> 42:29.296
Well, let's just say I'm going to be
keeping all my options open.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.882
That's very lawyerlike of you, counselor.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.845
Frank, you know what I'd like to do.

42:40.724 --> 42:42.268
I'd like to have a nice dinner...

42:42.935 --> 42:44.853
and maybe drink a little too much wine.

42:45.938 --> 42:48.357
Then you can drive my drunken soul
to the shore,

42:48.440 --> 42:49.858
and we can watch the waves.

42:50.109 --> 42:53.028
-Hmm?
-Mm-hmm. You got it.

42:53.112 --> 42:56.031
Frank-- (clears throat)
They'd like to see you over at Midtown.

42:56.448 --> 42:58.325
-They got a problem.
-I'll get to it later, Ray.

42:58.409 --> 43:00.244
I think you'll want to get to it now.

43:01.453 --> 43:02.705
It's Mrs. Furillo.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.876
She was arrested
during a sit-in at Chief Daniels' office.

43:11.922 --> 43:12.881
(laughs)

43:18.721 --> 43:23.392
You smug, chauvinistic,
insensitive flatfoot!

43:23.475 --> 43:25.477
Please, Mrs. Furillo,
talk to your husband.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.979
My husband?

43:27.771 --> 43:29.231
Oh, Frank.

43:29.315 --> 43:31.734
I don't want you here.
I don't want to see you.

43:31.817 --> 43:33.819
Walsh. What's your problem, Fay?

43:34.486 --> 43:38.490
Your shining shield, 1974.
That's what's the problem.

43:39.241 --> 43:42.244
Detective John Walsh took it upon himself

43:42.328 --> 43:45.497
while all the other members of WAD
were being honorably arrested,

43:45.581 --> 43:47.708
to single me out
for preferential treatment.

43:47.791 --> 43:51.754
And why? Entirely because my ex-husband's
a police officer.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.298
-Let's go home, Fay.
-(sighs)

43:55.090 --> 43:56.425
Do you know what this is, Frank?

43:56.925 --> 44:00.220
This is blatant reverse discrimination.
That's what.

44:00.471 --> 44:04.224
And you better believe the ACLU's
gonna be hearing about this.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.396
The look on Midge Dolson's face

44:09.480 --> 44:12.733
when your frat buddy here
pulled me off that paddy wagon.

44:13.192 --> 44:16.695
My credibility with my sisters is ruined,
totally ruined.

44:17.529 --> 44:18.697
I'm a fink!

44:22.242 --> 44:23.118
Thanks, Walsh.

44:27.623 --> 44:28.540
(exhales)

44:32.961 --> 44:36.674
Say, what's a precinct captain's ex-wife
gotta do to get arrested in this town,

44:36.757 --> 44:38.050
jaywalk in the nude?

44:38.676 --> 44:41.011
Frank, this was very, very serious to me.

44:41.095 --> 44:44.014
All I wanted to do was make a statement.
I wanted to be counted.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.225
-Hello, Fay.
-Oh.

44:47.267 --> 44:50.396
Uh, I'm sorry.
I see I've interrupted something here.

44:50.479 --> 44:53.023
-It's okay. Don't worry. I'll take a cab.
-Fay.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.776
-No, no, no. It's all right. I swear.
-Fay!

44:58.570 --> 45:01.198
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry.

45:01.448 --> 45:04.451
Uh, how insensitive of me.
I-- I'll get in the backseat.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.745
Uh, look, it doesn't matter. Honestly.

45:06.829 --> 45:09.707
No, no, please.
Miss Davenport, I get out first.

45:10.416 --> 45:13.127
Unless...
Do you prefer to ride in the back?

45:13.210 --> 45:15.796
I'll get in the backseat.
We can all get in the backseat.

45:15.879 --> 45:17.631
But for God's sake, let's get on the road.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.307
Well, thanks for the ride.

45:27.683 --> 45:29.518
I hope you both have a very nice evening.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.437
-Good night, Fay.
-Good night, Fay.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.354
Good night.

45:46.201 --> 45:47.745
Maybe we should call it a night.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.873
I'd settle for a back rub
and the<i> Late Show.</i>

45:50.956 --> 45:54.042
Absolutely not. I've been hearing great
things about this Basque restaurant--

45:54.126 --> 45:57.671
-(pager beeps)
-Oh, damn. I'm sorry.

45:58.046 --> 45:58.881
(beeping stops)

46:01.425 --> 46:02.718
(chatter on police radio)

46:07.306 --> 46:08.182
What, ice pick?

46:09.641 --> 46:11.059
Chest and back.

46:26.867 --> 46:28.410
What is it? Homicide?

46:28.994 --> 46:31.580
Yeah. Tyler Bragg.

46:31.872 --> 46:34.458
Harmon just couldn't wait.
Did it in front of a crowd.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.462
-(rain falling)
-HARMON: What if I did kill him?

46:39.254 --> 46:42.925
He rolled on me.
I got an image I gotta watch.

46:43.175 --> 46:45.427
And I can't let somebody
get away with that.

46:45.511 --> 46:47.054
I can't operate.

46:49.890 --> 46:50.724
Harmon,

46:53.185 --> 46:55.270
I do believe we have you this time.

46:56.104 --> 46:59.566
You got me, but you ain't gonna keep me.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.111
Five people in this room heard you confess
to cold-blooded murder.

47:03.195 --> 47:06.156
Come on, man. I said, "What if."

47:06.532 --> 47:10.410
Fourteen people
saw you stab Bragg to death outside.

47:10.494 --> 47:12.329
-That's not a "what if."
-Look.

47:12.412 --> 47:13.288
On my client's behalf,

47:13.372 --> 47:16.166
-I have to object to this kind of--
-HARMON: Shut up, man!

47:17.084 --> 47:18.168
You don't know nothin'.

47:19.169 --> 47:22.089
Let's just assume, hypothetical-like,

47:22.172 --> 47:25.300
I killed Tyler for rattin' on me and all.

47:25.717 --> 47:27.135
Who you jivin', man?

47:27.803 --> 47:30.305
I can't do double-digit time for that.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.599
A couple of dudes get in a fight--

47:32.808 --> 47:36.353
a little self-defense,
a little crime of passion.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.982
I got my lawyer here,
and we start talkin' hearin'

47:40.065 --> 47:43.569
and we start discussin', uh,
evidence and whatnot.

47:43.652 --> 47:46.738
And me, I'm free and clear.

47:46.822 --> 47:49.491
I got a clean record
since I been an adult.

47:50.742 --> 47:52.870
You talkin' about hard time now?

47:54.830 --> 47:57.207
And for a homicide like Tyler.

47:57.749 --> 47:59.126
What's the most you could get?

48:00.043 --> 48:01.753
Three years and change?

48:02.671 --> 48:04.506
I can do that easy.

48:05.257 --> 48:09.720
So don't be jivin' me about double digits.

48:16.518 --> 48:17.561
JOYCE: He's won, Frank.

48:18.937 --> 48:22.649
He killed a warm, loving, committed human
being who had everything to live for,

48:22.733 --> 48:24.192
and he got away with it clean.

48:24.818 --> 48:28.071
Well, he'll do time. Maybe not as much
as you and I would wish, but--

48:28.155 --> 48:29.489
Three years and change.

48:31.325 --> 48:33.660
Just about the time it takes
to get a law degree.

48:47.799 --> 48:50.802
(closing theme playing)
