00:00.062 --> 00:01.440
<i>Previously on Guilt...</i>

00:01.500 --> 00:02.792
Scotland Yard executed an

00:02.852 --> 00:05.856
arrest warrant for Grace Atwood
in the murder of Molly Ryan.

00:05.916 --> 00:07.300
You'll be safe here
while you're healing up.

00:07.360 --> 00:08.327
<i>Did they...</i>

00:08.387 --> 00:10.601
ask you anything about that night?

00:10.661 --> 00:11.690
It's our secret.

00:12.005 --> 00:15.297
You couldn't help Molly that
night, but you can help her now.

00:15.357 --> 00:17.150
Prince Theo killed Molly.

00:17.210 --> 00:18.813
Jessica Marshall was a client,

00:18.884 --> 00:20.682
which is how she wound up
on Molly Ryan's phone

00:20.760 --> 00:22.074
the night she went missing.

00:22.431 --> 00:24.692
I'll bet someone paid a pretty
penny for that painting.

00:24.752 --> 00:27.138
- You think we could trace it?
- You tried to frame me.

00:27.198 --> 00:29.227
<i>Well, you wanted me
to frame someone, didn't you?</i>

00:29.329 --> 00:30.735
I've got a witness, Your Highness.

00:30.795 --> 00:32.603
He saw you kill Molly Ryan.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.646
You leave me no choice, Detective,

00:34.706 --> 00:36.490
but to inform Internal Affairs

00:36.550 --> 00:38.775
about how you planted evidence
on Donovan Trimbly.

00:38.835 --> 00:41.578
You don't get to touch me,
not ever again.

00:41.638 --> 00:45.200
Put me on the stand. I want
to testify against Prince Theo.

00:45.260 --> 00:48.287
I know a way to finish
what our fathers started,

00:48.347 --> 00:50.599
<i>to remind England that
we haven't forgotten everything</i>

00:50.659 --> 00:52.889
<i>- the Crown's taken from us.</i>
- This'll do.

00:52.949 --> 00:54.660
Are you sure
you have the stones for this?

00:54.933 --> 00:56.719
He killed my sister.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.643
Okay. All right, why don't you
move the camera over here.

01:16.141 --> 01:17.100
That looks good.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.450
Okay, we're good to go.

Streaming in three, two, one.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.922
Nine weeks from the day she was arrested

01:24.982 --> 01:26.806
in her posh West End hotel,

01:26.866 --> 01:29.489
<i>Grace Atwood will finally go on trial</i>

01:29.549 --> 01:32.363
<i>for the murder
of her flatmate, Molly Ryan.</i>

01:32.423 --> 01:34.170
<i>Crowds have already started
to gather for one of</i>

01:34.230 --> 01:38.166
<i>the most highly anticipated
murder trials in recent memory,</i>

01:38.226 --> 01:40.029
<i>with opening arguments scheduled</i>

01:40.089 --> 01:41.710
<i>to begin in a few short hours.</i>

01:42.147 --> 01:44.069
<i>There's probably no one more anxious</i>

01:44.129 --> 01:45.865
<i>to get these proceedings underway</i>

01:45.925 --> 01:47.781
<i>than Grace Atwood herself.</i>

01:48.518 --> 01:51.931
<i>I know the real question
on many of your minds is:</i>

01:51.991 --> 01:54.401
<i>what will Grace wear to court today?</i>

01:54.604 --> 01:56.922
<i>Well, my sources tell me to expect</i>

01:56.982 --> 01:59.588
<i>something fab yet conservative.</i>

01:59.814 --> 02:02.861
Mom got this for me when
I graduated from law school.

02:02.994 --> 02:05.166
It's always been good luck
for me at trial.

02:08.205 --> 02:10.624
<i>Ms. Atwood is
in good hands with Attorney</i>

02:10.684 --> 02:14.582
<i>Stan Gutterie, the brash Yank
who has yet to lose a case.</i>

02:14.642 --> 02:17.131
<i>Of course, there's a first
for everything.</i>

02:17.191 --> 02:19.981
<i>And if Gutterie wants
to maintain his perfect record,</i>

02:20.041 --> 02:22.583
<i>he's going to have to contend
with what's said to be</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:25.257
<i>a mountain of evidence

02:25.317 --> 02:27.071
<i>That's not to say the prosecution</i>

02:27.131 --> 02:28.972
<i>will have an easy time of it.</i>

02:29.032 --> 02:31.696
<i>In addition to recent
revelations of Molly Ryan's</i>

02:31.756 --> 02:33.972
<i>involvement with
The Courtenay sex club scandal,</i>

02:34.260 --> 02:37.794
<i>Prosecutor Hall must also

<i>DS Alex Bruno's abrupt

Hey, everyone!

03:46.082 --> 03:47.840
Molly Ryan here.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.139
Just wanted to let you all know
this will be

03:50.199 --> 03:52.217
my last post for a while.

03:52.373 --> 03:55.186
I'm officially done
with my London travel videos,

03:55.485 --> 03:58.660
because... I'm here to stay.

03:58.851 --> 04:02.035
I've decided to make London
my permanent home.

04:02.095 --> 04:04.761
I'm really sorry, Mum.

04:04.821 --> 04:07.425
I'm sure one day I'll look back
at this with my kids,

04:07.485 --> 04:11.036
and we'll laugh our heads off
at my bonkers-looking hair.

04:11.306 --> 04:15.334
But I'll tell them that was one
of the happiest days of my life.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.257
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

04:20.382 --> 04:23.238
this video was taken on March 21st,

04:23.298 --> 04:26.418
the day Molly bought a pregnancy
test from her local chemist.

04:27.004 --> 04:32.009
A bright, young university
student with a promising future.

04:32.140 --> 04:34.469
A girl filled with optimism and hope.

04:35.140 --> 04:39.938
... who ran in unsavory circles,

04:39.998 --> 04:43.360
where sex and drugs

04:43.443 --> 04:46.344
and even murder were commonplace.

04:46.404 --> 04:49.344
The defense is gonna try
and distract you

04:49.404 --> 04:52.642
with scandal, innuendo,
but we're not here

04:52.702 --> 04:55.584
to prove if Molly Ryan was
a virgin or a saint.

04:56.039 --> 04:58.207
None of that matters. What matters is...

04:58.267 --> 05:00.191
Molly was having an affair

05:00.613 --> 05:05.723
with a very powerful,
self-indulgent and reckless man

05:06.679 --> 05:09.354
who got her pregnant.

05:09.635 --> 05:14.935
A man who had everything to lose
if that child were born.

05:15.271 --> 05:18.972
This case comes down
to one simple notion:

05:19.437 --> 05:22.829
you find the daddy, you find the baddy.

05:23.397 --> 05:26.887
Unfortunately, the authorities,
they cannot find him.

05:27.907 --> 05:28.907
But I did.

05:29.698 --> 05:31.803
We have Molly's murderer in custody.

05:31.863 --> 05:34.082
She's sitting right there.

05:34.142 --> 05:36.895
Now, folks, I am no scientist.

05:36.955 --> 05:39.314
But I do know that a woman

05:39.374 --> 05:42.022
cannot get another woman pregnant.

05:42.768 --> 05:46.505
Ergo, Grace did not
make a baby with Molly.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.313
But we have a witness

05:48.495 --> 05:53.178
who puts the father
at the scene of the murder.

05:54.639 --> 05:56.855
Grace Atwood has a documented history

05:56.915 --> 05:58.734
of lashing out in jealous rages.

05:58.794 --> 06:00.846
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm confident

06:00.924 --> 06:02.450
you will find Grace Atwood...

06:02.510 --> 06:05.482
... did not, would not and could not

06:05.542 --> 06:08.254
have murdered her best friend.

06:09.738 --> 06:11.749
Court is adjourned until tomorrow.

06:16.397 --> 06:17.855
Well, it's the wig, right?

06:17.915 --> 06:20.167
You jealous you don't get to wear one?

06:20.917 --> 06:23.044
Could never pull it off
quite like you do.

06:37.742 --> 06:39.727
Civilian life's still treating you well?

06:40.711 --> 06:43.214
I've seen every rerun of <i>Ripper Street.</i>

06:43.898 --> 06:46.377
Getting to drink more though,
that's for sure.

06:47.630 --> 06:50.382
All alone, one-star motel.
Glamorous, mate.

06:50.442 --> 06:52.356
Would you rather I was back in
my flat with a bullet in my head

06:52.416 --> 06:54.856
courtesy of Her Majesty's
Secret Service?

06:54.916 --> 06:56.288
You sure you want to do this?

06:56.743 --> 06:59.448
What, the lamb curry?
It's not that spicy, is it?

07:02.937 --> 07:05.168
Prince Theo killed Molly, Pike.

07:06.942 --> 07:08.194
I'm not just gonna let him walk

07:08.254 --> 07:10.349
<i>and</i> put an innocent girl in jail for it.

07:10.409 --> 07:11.540
Okay, I get it.

07:12.086 --> 07:13.670
But what you got to remember, Bruno,

07:13.730 --> 07:15.255
you're a disgraced cop now.

07:15.315 --> 07:17.429
You get up on that stand
and you tell those people

07:17.489 --> 07:20.446
that their beloved prince is a killer,

07:21.103 --> 07:23.161
they're not just gonna think
you're a nutter,

07:23.954 --> 07:25.415
they're gonna hate you.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.414
With a passion.

07:28.039 --> 07:30.475
Well, they can't hate me
any more than I hate myself.

07:30.944 --> 07:33.929
A child killer is going free
because of me.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.377
I'm sure as hell not letting
another murderer get off.

07:44.775 --> 07:47.588
I told you, I-I saw him from my window.

07:47.648 --> 07:49.234
And how did you know it was Prince Theo?

07:49.294 --> 07:50.359
Because he's the prince.

07:50.419 --> 07:52.997
My mum has a plate
with his bloody face on it.

07:53.057 --> 07:56.211
Neville, remember what I told you.

07:56.831 --> 07:58.197
Don't use the word "bloody."

07:58.269 --> 07:59.832
Just try to keep your cool.

07:59.892 --> 08:02.586
- I-I don't want to practice anymore.
- Well, we have to.

08:02.646 --> 08:05.232
The prosecutor's gonna be
a lot tougher on you than I am.

08:06.076 --> 08:07.842
I'm not gonna testify, then.

08:07.902 --> 08:10.894
Neville...
-No, they're gonna call me mental.

08:11.119 --> 08:12.869
In front of everyone.

08:17.349 --> 08:19.184
Remember why you're doing this.

08:19.316 --> 08:21.521
You're the only one
who can stop the prince

08:21.581 --> 08:22.980
from hurting anyone else.

08:23.972 --> 08:25.370
Molly would want that.

08:28.669 --> 08:30.271
Wh-What if I'm too nervous?

08:30.670 --> 08:32.857
When I'm nervous, I can't talk.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.847
Well, if you're nervous, look at me.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.044
I'll be right there in front of you.

08:37.482 --> 08:39.091
Every step of the way.

08:40.013 --> 08:42.707
I'm sorry. Visiting hours are over.

08:48.406 --> 08:49.961
You'll do fine, Neville.

08:52.291 --> 08:54.515
Will you come visit me tomorrow?

08:54.575 --> 08:57.554
I'll come visit you every day
until you testify.

08:57.991 --> 08:59.022
I promise.

09:25.181 --> 09:27.066
Thought you could hide, did you?

09:36.398 --> 09:37.589
Who's hiding?

09:38.638 --> 09:39.935
Fancy a drink, mate?

09:40.825 --> 09:41.836
Crushed ice, cubed...?

09:41.896 --> 09:45.485
I'm afraid a drink isn't gonna
make this go away, Bruno.

09:52.575 --> 09:54.421
<i>Prince Theo will be dedicating</i>

09:54.481 --> 09:56.929
<i>the new neonatal wing at
the Royal Children's Hospital</i>

09:56.989 --> 09:58.933
<i>in Hackney next Friday.</i>

09:58.993 --> 10:00.589
<i>The ribbon-cutting ceremony
is open to the public.</i>

10:00.649 --> 10:01.646
Hello!

10:03.973 --> 10:05.934
- You're back early!
- Hello.

10:06.650 --> 10:07.930
How's my favorite waitress?

10:07.990 --> 10:09.001
Good. How are you?

10:09.979 --> 10:12.247
I, um, got something I want to show you.

10:14.028 --> 10:15.188
Mm, so do I.

10:15.396 --> 10:16.745
Not that.

10:16.805 --> 10:17.869
Look.

10:20.017 --> 10:21.718
- Australia?
- Yeah.

10:21.778 --> 10:24.087
It's warm, like, all year-round.

10:25.615 --> 10:27.605
I want to move there, Patrick.

10:28.096 --> 10:30.666
With you. Just put London behind us.

10:30.726 --> 10:32.863
No, come on, we don't have
that kind of money, Kaley.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.003
Not even close.

10:34.063 --> 10:36.389
Why do you think I'm serving
fish and chips all day?

10:38.201 --> 10:41.167
You know what the first thing
we do is when we get to Sydney?

10:42.729 --> 10:43.844
Surf lessons.

10:44.422 --> 10:45.617
You're mad.

10:45.677 --> 10:47.743
- That's why you fancy me.
- Mm.

10:50.893 --> 10:51.896
See?

10:52.529 --> 10:54.454
Aren't you glad you didn't
go after the prince?

10:54.650 --> 10:56.892
It's so clearly obvious
this Grace girl did it.

10:58.356 --> 11:00.329
You would've done in an innocent man.

11:03.183 --> 11:04.269
You're right.

11:07.317 --> 11:08.782
I'll see ya after my shower.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.933
- Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm...
- Wait.

11:10.993 --> 11:12.325
After my shower.

11:24.071 --> 11:26.205
You're a hard man
to track down, Patrick.

11:27.242 --> 11:29.865
Well, been laying low.

11:30.279 --> 11:31.237
Staying out of trouble.

11:31.297 --> 11:32.777
If you wanted to stay out of trouble,

11:32.837 --> 11:34.272
you'd have gone back to Belfast.

11:34.522 --> 11:36.151
The deal we made, remember?

11:36.211 --> 11:38.241
I'd have you thrown in jail
on that assault charge

11:38.301 --> 11:39.430
if you didn't leave London.

11:39.954 --> 11:41.425
Are you gonna arrest me?

11:41.994 --> 11:44.744
I'm tempted. Very tempted.

11:47.322 --> 11:49.097
I need you in court.

11:49.157 --> 11:51.325
Molly deserves to be represented
by a member of her family.

11:51.385 --> 11:53.160
And since your mother
is too sick to travel,

11:53.220 --> 11:55.016
that job falls to you.

11:58.027 --> 11:59.513
You got the wrong person.

11:59.658 --> 12:01.621
Grace Atwood did not kill my sister.

12:01.681 --> 12:03.989
Then tell me who you think did,
because I've got

12:04.049 --> 12:06.412
more evidence against her
than I know what to do with.

12:08.920 --> 12:09.975
Hello.

12:13.630 --> 12:15.329
I get why you stayed in London.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.768
I'll see you in court tomorrow.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.178
Your security detail's been set

12:34.238 --> 12:36.011
for the ribbon cutting
ceremony on Friday.

12:36.071 --> 12:38.224
You'll have plenty of time
before the state dinner

12:38.284 --> 12:39.360
with the prime minister.

12:39.579 --> 12:40.625
Very well.

12:46.881 --> 12:48.210
You can't be serious.

12:49.119 --> 12:50.717
I haven't rung the girl once.

12:50.777 --> 12:53.011
You said you were done.
- I am.

12:53.071 --> 12:54.187
Your Highness,

12:54.601 --> 12:57.881
these... compulsions of yours,

12:58.412 --> 12:59.826
they only lead to trouble.

13:01.584 --> 13:04.214
You have to try to keep them in check.

13:04.698 --> 13:06.400
So you're my psychiatrist now?

13:06.460 --> 13:08.586
I didn't say that.
- And don't ever...

13:08.646 --> 13:10.511
tell me how to behave, Phillip.

13:18.987 --> 13:21.303
As opinions run hot
outside the courthouse,

13:21.363 --> 13:23.701
the jury is still
focused on Gwendolyn Hall

13:23.761 --> 13:26.908
as she begins her second week
presenting the Crown's evidence.

13:27.268 --> 13:30.829
The jury's already seen Grace's
DNA under Molly's fingernails

13:30.889 --> 13:33.151
and the gruesome crime scene photos,

13:33.312 --> 13:36.375
including Grace's feet
stained with Molly's blood.

13:36.698 --> 13:39.353
Today, they get something
much easier on the eyes.

13:39.509 --> 13:42.230
Grace's ex, Luc Pascal.

13:49.459 --> 13:52.129
Is that you in the video
with Molly, Mr. Pascal?

13:52.754 --> 13:54.865
Molly was drunk. I went along with it.

13:54.925 --> 13:56.325
It didn't mean anything.

13:56.385 --> 13:57.913
Did Ms. Atwood witness

13:57.973 --> 14:00.274
this lap dance
that didn't mean anything?

14:00.334 --> 14:02.103
Grace didn't kill Molly.

14:02.163 --> 14:04.000
She wouldn't hurt her!
She wouldn't hurt anyone!

14:04.060 --> 14:06.221
You didn't answer
my question, Mr. Pascal.

14:06.281 --> 14:08.051
Grace, I love you.

14:08.111 --> 14:11.021
Please don't address
the defendant, Mr. Pascal.

14:14.337 --> 14:15.636
I have a statement here

14:15.696 --> 14:19.701
that you gave to police
on April 9th of this year.

14:19.761 --> 14:21.163
Is that your signature?

14:21.351 --> 14:23.251
- Yes.
- Can you please read

14:23.311 --> 14:25.492
the last line, which I have
indicated in brackets?

14:27.154 --> 14:29.169
"It must have been
about 2:00 in the morning.

14:29.255 --> 14:31.274
"Grace went downstairs
to use the bathroom.

14:31.334 --> 14:33.158
She was gone for over an hour."

14:33.369 --> 14:35.056
I swear, Grace, they twisted my words.

14:35.116 --> 14:36.564
- I didn't mean that...
- If you don't

14:36.624 --> 14:38.367
restrict yourself
to answering the questions

14:38.427 --> 14:41.141
put to you, I will find you in contempt.

14:41.453 --> 14:44.024
We can all see how
much you care for Ms. Atwood.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.286
You don't want her
to go to prison, do you?

14:46.418 --> 14:47.459
- No, because she didn't...
- You would do

14:47.519 --> 14:49.462
anything to make sure she goes free.

14:50.477 --> 14:53.073
You'd even keep her
darkest secret, wouldn't you?

14:53.174 --> 14:54.474
No, that's not true.

14:56.122 --> 14:57.129
Really?

14:57.652 --> 14:59.889
Do you recall a conversation
that you had with the defendant

14:59.949 --> 15:02.561
when she visited you in custody
on April 8th?

15:02.976 --> 15:04.459
No, I don't remember.

15:04.519 --> 15:06.096
Let me refresh your memory.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.590
Did they...

15:10.650 --> 15:12.951
ask you anything again

15:13.896 --> 15:15.112
about that night?

15:15.172 --> 15:16.487
About us?

15:16.656 --> 15:18.431
No. I wouldn't say

15:18.491 --> 15:20.325
anything if they did... you know that.

15:20.525 --> 15:22.372
No one can know, Luc. Ever.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.744
No one will ever know.

15:26.290 --> 15:28.200
No one except you and me.

15:28.334 --> 15:29.401
It's our secret.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.152
All right, I object. I'm sorry.

15:31.212 --> 15:33.934
A nine-year-old with a laptop
could splice this together.

15:33.994 --> 15:34.901
Mr. Gutterie,

15:34.961 --> 15:38.375
I ruled on this in pretrial
and I haven't wavered.

15:38.435 --> 15:39.515
It's admissible.

15:40.421 --> 15:43.301
Is that you and Grace
in the audio recording,

15:43.361 --> 15:44.366
Mr. Pascal?

15:44.851 --> 15:46.101
Yes, but it's not what it sounds...

15:46.161 --> 15:47.380
No further questions.

15:58.926 --> 16:00.150
Tough day, was it?

16:02.366 --> 16:04.218
Can't imagine it's easy.

16:04.278 --> 16:05.945
Sitting up there,
listening to all that crap

16:06.005 --> 16:07.245
they say about you.

16:08.569 --> 16:10.328
I used to think if I was innocent,

16:10.388 --> 16:12.419
that a jury couldn't find me guilty,

16:12.479 --> 16:15.956
but now... I don't know.

16:16.411 --> 16:17.982
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

16:18.042 --> 16:19.389
I don't think you did it.

16:22.795 --> 16:24.082
Do you want to come to court tomorrow

16:24.142 --> 16:25.166
and tell the jury that?

16:25.226 --> 16:26.909
I look like a fancy lawyer to you?

16:27.065 --> 16:29.474
You got Stan Gutterie.
You hardly need me.

16:29.604 --> 16:31.547
You read up on everyone
you drive to trial?

16:32.440 --> 16:33.818
Just the nice ones.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.547
Nice, huh?

16:36.440 --> 16:38.481
No one's called me that in a long time.

16:40.534 --> 16:42.263
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

16:43.709 --> 16:45.004
Depends.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.556
I was wondering if...

16:49.970 --> 16:51.802
if you could put on some music.

16:53.591 --> 16:56.532
Feels like I haven't heard music
in a really long time.

16:57.247 --> 16:59.966
Music? That I can do.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.419
What's going on?

17:26.578 --> 17:27.895
- You need to stay back.
- Is Neville okay?

17:27.954 --> 17:29.193
Please, stay back!

17:37.463 --> 17:39.218
If I'd just let Neville be,

17:39.937 --> 17:42.760
if I hadn't manipulated him
into testifying,

17:43.057 --> 17:44.845
he'd still be alive right now.

17:44.905 --> 17:47.100
There is a time and place for guilt.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.184
This is not one of those times.

17:49.552 --> 17:52.573
That kid was locked up
in a psychiatric ward.

17:52.633 --> 17:55.255
He's been battling demons
his whole life.

17:55.315 --> 17:56.515
Finally the demons won.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.022
No, I don't buy it.

17:58.140 --> 17:59.895
Neville wasn't despondent.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.469
He wasn't depressed.

18:01.529 --> 18:03.418
He wasn't a suicide, Stan.

18:03.478 --> 18:04.658
I think the prince had Neville murdered,

18:04.718 --> 18:06.847
and we should get it out
into the press immediately.

18:06.907 --> 18:08.368
Oh, well, there's a good idea.

18:08.428 --> 18:09.759
Plant a conspiracy theory

18:09.819 --> 18:12.056
that will be instantly ridiculed,

18:12.116 --> 18:14.950
so when we actually do have
to present it in court,

18:15.010 --> 18:17.110
it will have zero credibility.

18:17.170 --> 18:19.263
No, we play this card at the right time,

18:19.323 --> 18:20.408
and that is in trial.

18:20.468 --> 18:22.768
I think we should put
Roz Walters on the stand.

18:22.828 --> 18:24.185
Have her tie the prince to Molly.

18:24.245 --> 18:26.836
Sure, the madam
with the criminal history.

18:27.601 --> 18:29.205
What about Grace?

18:29.291 --> 18:31.215
She's been begging us
to let her testify.

18:31.275 --> 18:32.473
Maybe we should reconsider.

18:32.533 --> 18:35.476
She could say she saw the killer
at the scene of the murder.

18:35.536 --> 18:37.063
Oh, you-you mean the faceless killer

18:37.123 --> 18:38.718
that she saw under hypnosis.

18:38.778 --> 18:39.958
Your idea.

18:40.737 --> 18:42.314
Come on, no one's gonna buy that.

18:42.374 --> 18:44.476
Besides, that opens her up
for cross-examination.

18:44.536 --> 18:45.489
You know this.

18:45.549 --> 18:48.357
Nat, we have our witness.

18:48.417 --> 18:50.409
The detective ready to finger

18:50.469 --> 18:52.813
that perverted prince
for once and for all.

18:52.873 --> 18:55.793
What we have is a crooked cop
who the jury is not gonna like.

18:55.853 --> 18:58.268
With that smile and those baby blues?

18:58.328 --> 19:01.436
Natalie, we want him to admit
that he was corrupt,

19:01.496 --> 19:03.756
that he was forced to alter evidence

19:03.816 --> 19:05.417
by the prince of Wales,

19:05.477 --> 19:08.382
Molly Ryan's favorite Courtenay client.

19:08.442 --> 19:10.161
And once that genie
is out of the bottle,

19:10.221 --> 19:11.795
this trial's as good as over.

19:15.158 --> 19:16.626
At this time, I would like to call

19:16.686 --> 19:19.984
former Detective Sergeant
Alex Bruno to the stand, please.

19:26.807 --> 19:27.990
Is it true

19:28.877 --> 19:32.737
that you were recently sacked
from Scotland Yard?

19:33.932 --> 19:35.150
Yes.

19:35.619 --> 19:38.244
Did your firing have something to do

19:38.304 --> 19:40.278
with violating protocol

19:40.338 --> 19:42.813
while investigating a previous case?

19:44.110 --> 19:45.010
Yes.

19:45.070 --> 19:46.900
I must say, Mr. Bruno,

19:46.960 --> 19:50.892
I applaud your courage in coming
forward and admitting this.

19:50.952 --> 19:51.991
That takes character.

19:52.051 --> 19:53.978
I object. Counsel's testifying.

19:54.038 --> 19:55.250
Sustained.

19:55.573 --> 19:56.548
Let's talk about

19:56.608 --> 19:58.730
the Molly Ryan case then, shall we?

19:59.011 --> 20:01.743
During the course of the investigation,

20:01.803 --> 20:05.379
did you ever act in a manner
that violated protocol?

20:15.118 --> 20:17.850
I'd like to invoke my right
not to incriminate myself.

20:20.649 --> 20:22.517
Let me rephrase the question.

20:22.577 --> 20:27.203
Did you ever tamper with any
evidence in the Molly Ryan case?

20:27.263 --> 20:29.715
I invoke my right
not to incriminate myself.

20:29.775 --> 20:33.765
Mr. Bruno, did you not,
at the behest of a third party,

20:33.825 --> 20:34.791
alter evidence

20:34.851 --> 20:37.162
- in the Molly Ryan case?
- I object!

20:37.222 --> 20:38.750
- He's leading the witness.
- Sustained.

20:38.810 --> 20:40.916
Is it true that you were contacted

20:40.976 --> 20:44.135
by a powerful client
of Molly Ryan's from

20:44.195 --> 20:47.204
The Courtenay sex club
who blackmailed you

20:47.264 --> 20:50.746
into corrupting evidence
in order to obfuscate his guilt?

20:50.806 --> 20:53.162
Objection!  Argumentative.
- Sustained.

20:53.222 --> 20:54.367
What was this man's name,

20:54.427 --> 20:56.334
- Mr. Bruno? Was it...
- Mr. Gutterie,

20:56.394 --> 20:58.976
that's enough.
Strike that from the record.

21:03.695 --> 21:04.922
I'm...

21:05.393 --> 21:06.943
done with this witness.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.739
Good afternoon, Mr. Bruno.
Thank you for your time today.

21:13.676 --> 21:15.224
During the course of this investigation,

21:15.284 --> 21:17.528
did you have sexual relations
with the defendant's sister,

21:17.588 --> 21:18.781
Natalie Atwood?

21:18.841 --> 21:19.641
I object.

21:19.664 --> 21:21.754
Irrelevant, inflammatory

21:21.814 --> 21:23.815
and highly inappropriate.

21:24.131 --> 21:25.071
Your Honor, the defense

21:25.101 --> 21:26.652
has implied that former
DS Bruno's actions

21:26.712 --> 21:27.802
hurt their client.

21:27.862 --> 21:29.468
I'm simply trying to establish that,

21:29.528 --> 21:31.318
if anything,
the detective would be biased

21:31.378 --> 21:32.502
towards helping her.

21:32.562 --> 21:33.861
I'll allow it.

21:34.514 --> 21:35.824
Mr. Bruno,

21:36.982 --> 21:39.401
did you have sex with
the defendant's sister?

21:46.713 --> 21:47.973
Yes.

21:49.249 --> 21:51.970
- That did not influence...
- No further questions.

22:05.377 --> 22:07.128
Smart move staying hush, mate.

22:07.188 --> 22:08.469
I don't feel very smart.

22:08.529 --> 22:10.528
Yeah, well, I've got something
that might cheer you up.

22:10.588 --> 22:12.427
Remember that painting
in the photo of Molly

22:12.487 --> 22:14.409
and the missing woman, Jessica Marshall?

22:14.644 --> 22:16.509
Yeah, well, the artist was famous.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.553
It sold at auction in 1998,

22:18.613 --> 22:19.938
and it's been hanging on the wall

22:19.998 --> 22:21.238
of a Hertfordshire estate ever since.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.620
Hertfordshire?

22:23.652 --> 22:27.500
Prince Theo told me he met
Molly Ryan in Hertfordshire.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.073
You think that's a coincidence?

22:29.455 --> 22:30.842
What if he had something to do

22:30.902 --> 22:32.926
with Jessica Marshall's disappearance?

22:33.079 --> 22:34.845
We need to get down to that
estate, have a look around.

22:34.905 --> 22:36.120
Some of us have got a job, mate.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.733
I'm working a homicide in Tottenham.

22:38.478 --> 22:39.374
Hold on.

22:39.434 --> 22:40.819
I've got to take this, sorry.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.455
Yeah.

22:45.431 --> 22:46.665
Hey.

22:47.681 --> 22:49.312
Hey!

22:49.372 --> 22:51.377
You were the one who came
to Gutterie begging him

22:51.437 --> 22:52.382
to put you on the stand.

22:52.442 --> 22:54.114
What the hell happened up there?

22:54.174 --> 22:55.960
What kind of game are you playing?

22:58.064 --> 22:59.829
I thought you cared about the truth.

23:00.298 --> 23:01.396
Justice.

23:01.911 --> 23:04.145
Putting away killers
so they don't kill again.

23:05.824 --> 23:08.790
That is why I kept my mouth shut.

23:08.914 --> 23:10.162
If I'd have...

23:12.172 --> 23:14.614
If I'd have testified
against the prince,

23:14.723 --> 23:16.191
they would've killed you.

23:18.699 --> 23:20.720
You don't believe
that Neville committed suicide

23:20.780 --> 23:21.658
any more than I do.

23:21.718 --> 23:23.602
I couldn't take that risk
with your life.

23:30.476 --> 23:32.936
Alex, you can't let him
get away with murder.

23:33.519 --> 23:35.161
No, I don't intend to.

23:35.907 --> 23:38.491
I'm going to Hertfordshire.
I've got a lead.

23:39.023 --> 23:40.460
Well, I'm coming with you.

23:40.852 --> 23:42.204
What about the trial?

23:42.264 --> 23:43.998
Stan has the courtroom covered.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.712
If there's evidence
that can exonerate Grace,

23:45.772 --> 23:47.597
I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for it to show up.

23:48.199 --> 23:49.729
I'm gonna help you find it.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.215
I've been spat at, vomited on.

23:58.285 --> 24:00.072
I've even had feces thrown at me once.

24:00.132 --> 24:01.553
That's disgusting!

24:01.613 --> 24:02.927
Why do you do it?

24:02.987 --> 24:04.672
I mean, you're a smart guy.

24:04.732 --> 24:07.048
There are a lot of other things
you could be doing.

24:07.887 --> 24:09.056
Pays well.

24:09.116 --> 24:10.488
Good benefits, pension.

24:10.548 --> 24:12.549
Yeah, but it's not what you want to do.

24:12.609 --> 24:13.856
What do <i>you</i> want?

24:14.621 --> 24:15.797
Me?

24:15.857 --> 24:17.063
Yeah?

24:20.991 --> 24:22.326
Well, this is gonna sound a little odd,

24:22.386 --> 24:24.359
so don't laugh, please.

24:24.722 --> 24:26.654
But I'm quite keen on horses.

24:26.998 --> 24:28.963
I grew up on a farm in Lincolnshire,

24:29.023 --> 24:31.016
rode and took care of them as a lad.

24:31.448 --> 24:33.400
I could see myself as a stablehand,

24:33.800 --> 24:35.968
horse groomer, you know,
that sort of thing.

24:37.871 --> 24:39.265
Told you it was odd.

24:41.398 --> 24:43.544
No, it's not odd at all.

24:46.882 --> 24:48.609
You know what'd be really odd?

24:50.748 --> 24:53.039
If you made a right turn here
instead of a left.

24:55.314 --> 24:56.598
What would happen?

24:57.092 --> 24:59.189
How long before they came
looking for us?

25:01.811 --> 25:03.491
So that's what this is all about.

25:03.624 --> 25:04.679
Trying to sweet-talk me

25:04.739 --> 25:06.266
into helping you make a run for it.

25:07.668 --> 25:09.417
Not very original, Grace.

25:09.712 --> 25:11.143
Fifth inmate this month.

25:18.792 --> 25:21.438
Oh, my God, you should see
the look on your face.

25:22.866 --> 25:24.413
You thought I was serious?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.424
Fell for that one.

25:31.870 --> 25:33.419
All right, you got me.

25:44.853 --> 25:47.360
As you know, our key witness died

25:47.420 --> 25:49.032
before he had a chance to testify.

25:49.092 --> 25:50.414
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

25:50.474 --> 25:53.806
And we believe that his death
was not a suicide,

25:53.866 --> 25:55.802
but rather a homicide.

25:55.862 --> 25:57.096
What?

25:57.308 --> 25:58.236
Your Honor,

25:58.296 --> 26:00.498
the coroner ruled the death a suicide.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.291
Decedent has a history of depression.

26:02.351 --> 26:04.102
His own father hung himself
when the boy was eight.

26:04.162 --> 26:06.898
Regardless of Madam Prosecutor's
callous attitude,

26:06.958 --> 26:09.068
we would like to present a new witness.

26:16.458 --> 26:19.145
You want to call the prince
of Wales as a witness?

26:19.205 --> 26:20.990
It's a stretch, Gutterie, even for you.

26:21.050 --> 26:22.008
With all due respect,

26:22.068 --> 26:23.986
Your Honor, he may bleed royal blue,

26:24.046 --> 26:27.504
but he is intimately involved
in this case.

26:27.564 --> 26:30.161
A fair and thorough defense of my client

26:30.221 --> 26:32.590
- depends on this testimony.
- Rubbish!

26:32.650 --> 26:34.758
Just another one of
his wildly inappropriate

26:34.818 --> 26:37.052
- distractions.
- Ms. Hall is right.

26:37.112 --> 26:40.929
You will not turn my courtroom
into a circus sideshow.

26:40.989 --> 26:42.989
Is that clear, Mr. Gutterie?

26:47.617 --> 26:49.994
I... I'm sorry, Your Honor,

26:50.054 --> 26:51.825
I-I don't understand

26:51.885 --> 26:54.791
why this witness
is being summarily denied

26:54.851 --> 26:56.594
because of his bloodline.

26:56.654 --> 26:59.386
Counsel, are you questioning
my authority?

26:59.446 --> 27:02.769
No, I am not, Your Honor; I am
questioning your impartiality.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.562
Has the Royal Family approached you?

27:04.622 --> 27:06.218
- 'Cause if that...
- One more word,

27:06.278 --> 27:07.764
and I will hold you in contempt.

27:07.824 --> 27:11.569
- If fighting for a fair trial...
- Is that clear?

27:11.629 --> 27:13.988
All right, then if, um, I may, uh,

27:14.048 --> 27:15.632
perhaps you can grant me a brief recess

27:15.692 --> 27:17.175
so I may find another witness,

27:17.235 --> 27:20.113
one that the prosecution
will not object to.

27:22.058 --> 27:23.284
<i>I told you.</i>

27:23.522 --> 27:24.917
I'm not testifying.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.643
That was before you heard
my proposition.

27:26.703 --> 27:29.066
We've evened the score, Gutterie.

27:29.637 --> 27:31.364
I gave up The Courtenay for you.

27:31.424 --> 27:34.009
- Sacrificed my livelihood.
- Your "livelihood."

27:34.069 --> 27:36.378
Your true calling is not
whoring out hotties,

27:36.438 --> 27:38.176
you're DJ Rozzie Roz.

27:38.236 --> 27:39.557
I heard you spin.

27:39.617 --> 27:41.783
You got the talent,
you certainly got the look.

27:41.843 --> 27:43.421
All you need is the break.

27:43.481 --> 27:45.491
And I'm just the guy
to make it happen for you,

27:45.551 --> 27:48.805
in the home away from home
for Tiesto, for David Guetta...

27:48.865 --> 27:50.245
Las Vegas?

27:51.190 --> 27:53.100
I'm talking "Roz Vegas."

27:53.264 --> 27:55.207
Former client of mine just opened up

27:55.267 --> 27:57.330
the brand-new hot spot on the Strip.

27:57.694 --> 28:01.770
He's eternally grateful for me
keeping his ass out of prison.

28:01.830 --> 28:03.824
In exchange, he's agreed to book you

28:03.884 --> 28:06.551
for a four-month stint
in his rooftop club.

28:07.575 --> 28:10.127
All you got to do
is tell the jury the truth.

28:10.187 --> 28:12.234
Prince Theo was shagging Molly Ryan,

28:12.294 --> 28:14.738
and he wasn't too happy
about the little prince

28:14.798 --> 28:16.096
sprouting in her belly.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.202
You must be pretty desperate.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.280
Having to bribe me.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.282
Technically, that's not a bribe.

28:22.342 --> 28:23.524
It's still dangerous.

28:23.584 --> 28:24.766
Roz.

28:25.606 --> 28:28.687
If this can get Grace off,
you have to try it.

28:29.296 --> 28:31.807
You ought to listen
to Drugstore Cowboy over here,

28:31.867 --> 28:33.154
'cause he's right.

28:39.390 --> 28:41.284
I don't have time for this.

28:45.298 --> 28:47.800
- That went well.
- Cheeky bugger.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.453
If I'd had my damn badge,
he would've talked,

28:49.513 --> 28:50.570
that's for sure.

28:51.575 --> 28:53.131
Where are you going?

28:56.287 --> 28:57.497
Hello.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.342
Really nice hedge work.

28:59.998 --> 29:01.321
"Takes an artist to tend a garden,"

29:01.381 --> 29:03.195
that's what my dad used to say.

29:03.343 --> 29:04.966
And this place needs to look good

29:05.026 --> 29:06.937
with all the parties
they throw here, right?

29:07.133 --> 29:08.728
Was a wedding last weekend.

29:08.788 --> 29:11.606
Some bloke got sick out here,
all over the gardenias.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.137
Can I talk to you about a woman

29:13.197 --> 29:15.171
who was at a party here last November?

29:15.294 --> 29:16.753
She hasn't been seen since.

29:16.813 --> 29:18.676
Her name's Jessica Marshall.

29:20.027 --> 29:21.551
What are you, the police?

29:27.158 --> 29:29.088
Do you have any siblings, sir?

29:29.242 --> 29:30.350
Brother or sister?

29:30.410 --> 29:31.594
One of each. Why?

29:31.654 --> 29:34.024
My sister, my little sister,

29:34.084 --> 29:36.591
is on trial for a murder
she didn't commit.

29:36.724 --> 29:38.373
And the disappearance of that woman

29:38.433 --> 29:40.148
could be a clue that could help her.

29:40.398 --> 29:43.728
So, please, if you can help us.

29:52.603 --> 29:53.865
Bloody hell.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.741
Do you know her?
Do you recognize this woman?

29:58.343 --> 29:59.550
Follow me.

30:16.171 --> 30:18.620
It's an exact match
to Jessica's earrings.

30:18.942 --> 30:21.192
Found it after one of them
strange parties.

30:21.252 --> 30:22.593
How was it strange?

30:22.656 --> 30:25.114
Well, first off,
there was security everywhere.

30:25.174 --> 30:27.240
Blokes in suits, earphones in one ear.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.307
Covered up the windows.

30:28.367 --> 30:29.659
God knows what they were doing inside.

30:29.719 --> 30:31.198
Where exactly did you find that?

30:31.258 --> 30:32.737
In the South Garden, back in the woods.

30:32.797 --> 30:33.718
And when was that?

30:33.778 --> 30:36.137
Last November,
just after Saint Andrew's Day.

30:36.197 --> 30:38.163
That's two days after she went missing.

30:38.223 --> 30:39.571
I'm calling Pike.

30:50.601 --> 30:52.689
<i>Prince Theo will be
arriving at the hospital</i>

30:52.749 --> 30:55.538
in the next 30 minutes,
and we will break to coverage

30:55.598 --> 30:57.100
as soon as it begins.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.106
This is CNB News.

31:02.661 --> 31:03.749
Stop.

31:03.809 --> 31:05.435
Uh, street's closed, mate. Turn
it around.

31:05.495 --> 31:07.355
I'm just picking up my little sister
from the hospital.

31:07.415 --> 31:08.506
She's being released now.

31:08.566 --> 31:10.804
You'll have to wait until after
Prince Theo's appearance.

31:10.864 --> 31:12.606
Sir, she's nine years old.

31:12.690 --> 31:14.785
She got hit by a bus
in Battersea last week.

31:14.845 --> 31:16.857
Broken leg, punctured lung.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.760
Bloody bus drivers.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.614
Sir, she's waiting for me.

31:21.083 --> 31:22.904
I'll-I'll be five minutes.

31:33.278 --> 31:35.330
All right. Make it quick.

31:36.642 --> 31:37.850
Aye.

31:44.449 --> 31:47.471
Ms. Walters, did you and Molly

31:47.531 --> 31:50.335
both work at The Courtenay Club?

31:50.757 --> 31:51.962
Yes.

31:52.022 --> 31:54.773
Where she was a prostitute, correct?

31:55.555 --> 31:56.627
Yes.

31:56.687 --> 31:59.020
And what was your position there?

31:59.309 --> 32:01.754
I worked in the accounting department.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.835
Must be good with numbers.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.512
Ms. Walters,

32:05.572 --> 32:08.816
did you have access
to the surveillance footage

32:08.876 --> 32:10.246
in the bedrooms?

32:10.442 --> 32:11.396
I did.

32:11.456 --> 32:13.654
Did you ever witness Molly Ryan

32:13.714 --> 32:16.498
providing sexual services?

32:17.435 --> 32:18.664
I did.

32:19.544 --> 32:22.971
Was there one gentleman in particular

32:23.031 --> 32:26.146
who began to see her increasingly often

32:26.206 --> 32:29.184
in the months before Molly's murder?

32:30.194 --> 32:31.230
Yes.

32:31.290 --> 32:32.785
And did this gentleman pay

32:32.845 --> 32:36.936
a steep premium for Molly
to be exclusive to him

32:36.996 --> 32:38.894
and only him?

32:40.024 --> 32:40.988
He did.

32:41.048 --> 32:43.276
Can you please tell us
this gentleman's name?

32:48.539 --> 32:50.308
Prince Theo.

32:50.965 --> 32:52.929
Objection! Inflammatory.

32:52.989 --> 32:54.975
Sustained. Silence in court!

32:55.035 --> 32:56.330
Your Honor, the jury needs to know

32:56.390 --> 32:58.052
that someone other than Grace Atwood

32:58.112 --> 32:59.566
is responsible for this crime!

32:59.626 --> 33:00.835
I'm warning you, Mr. Gutterie.

33:00.895 --> 33:03.904
Molly Ryan told you the prince of Wales

33:03.964 --> 33:05.739
got her pregnant, did she not?

33:05.799 --> 33:07.572
I swear to you, one more utterance,

33:07.632 --> 33:08.933
Gutterie, I will hold you in contempt!

33:08.993 --> 33:11.512
She told you that Prince Theo
knocked her up

33:11.572 --> 33:14.206
and threatened her if she kept
the baby, did she not?

33:14.266 --> 33:15.766
- Strike that from the record!
- Yes! Yes!

33:15.826 --> 33:17.082
That's it!

33:17.593 --> 33:21.022
Officer, arrest Mr. Gutterie
on charges of contempt of court.

33:22.027 --> 33:24.508
Jury, disregard those statements.

33:27.446 --> 33:29.698
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

33:34.743 --> 33:36.582
Still no comment from the Royal Family

33:36.642 --> 33:38.131
after Prince Theo was named

33:38.191 --> 33:40.404
in connection with
the Molly Ryan murder.

33:40.464 --> 33:41.798
Although the prince has canceled

33:41.858 --> 33:44.157
all of his upcoming public appearances.

33:44.217 --> 33:46.777
Legal experts are torn
over just how much impact

33:46.837 --> 33:48.781
this will have on the case, if any.

33:49.015 --> 33:51.953
The U. K. and the rest of
the globe are reeling in shock.

33:52.013 --> 33:53.059
In England, some have

33:53.119 --> 33:55.000
clamored for His Highness
to make a statement

33:55.060 --> 33:56.256
and deny the allegation.

33:56.316 --> 33:57.491
Excuse me, Your Highness?

33:57.551 --> 33:59.787
Miss Crockleby is on the line.

33:59.865 --> 34:01.018
Not now.

34:01.182 --> 34:03.119
Um, Her Majesty also rang.

34:03.179 --> 34:05.343
- She says...
- Not... now.

34:05.403 --> 34:07.836
...the very name
of the Monarchy is at stake.

34:21.737 --> 34:23.204
Word's out, Patty.

34:23.501 --> 34:26.333
Their noble prince is finally
rolling in the muck.

34:26.393 --> 34:27.768
It'll roll right off him.

34:27.829 --> 34:30.501
Especially when their witness
is a sex club worker

34:30.561 --> 34:31.782
with a rap sheet.

34:33.579 --> 34:35.690
I wish Roz kept her mouth shut.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.811
The royal bastard
canceled his appearance

34:37.871 --> 34:38.876
at the hospital today.

34:38.936 --> 34:39.934
Of course he did.

34:39.994 --> 34:42.610
- He's a bloody coward.
- I was right there, Declan.

34:42.670 --> 34:43.962
I had my shot.

34:44.022 --> 34:47.347
Now... now he's gonna...

34:47.743 --> 34:49.539
hide himself in that palace.

34:50.592 --> 34:52.362
I need a way to get to him.

34:55.067 --> 34:57.742
Men do strange things
in stressful times.

34:57.802 --> 34:59.343
Maybe the way to get to him...

35:01.234 --> 35:03.246
maybe you're laying right next to her.

35:03.330 --> 35:04.541
Kaley?

35:04.705 --> 35:05.794
No.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.149
Told you, I tried.

35:07.499 --> 35:08.998
She wants no part of it.

35:09.865 --> 35:11.430
Who says she needs to know?

35:28.945 --> 35:31.432
Heard your barrister
put on quite the performance.

35:32.205 --> 35:34.640
Yeah, let's just say my case
must be in pretty bad shape

35:34.700 --> 35:36.966
for him to pull something
that desperate.

35:37.026 --> 35:38.325
Hey, come on.

35:38.773 --> 35:40.020
You got to stay positive.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.864
It's the only way
you're gonna get through it.

35:43.102 --> 35:45.773
If this jury's got any brains,
they'll come to their senses

35:45.833 --> 35:47.108
and they'll acquit you.

35:47.168 --> 35:49.269
I saw the way they looked at me.

35:53.854 --> 35:56.426
My stepdad set up a trust fund for me.

35:58.671 --> 35:59.848
A big one.

36:01.021 --> 36:02.501
If they find me guilty,

36:02.763 --> 36:04.781
what the heck am I gonna
spend it all on?

36:10.054 --> 36:11.261
You could spend it.

36:11.997 --> 36:13.848
You want to live in the country?

36:14.239 --> 36:15.779
You want horses?

36:16.544 --> 36:17.810
You can.

36:19.499 --> 36:20.710
With me.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.891
I'd keep quiet if I were you.

36:28.156 --> 36:30.168
Don't want to get in any more
trouble than you already are.

36:49.871 --> 36:51.065
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

36:51.125 --> 36:52.308
Stan did it.

36:52.368 --> 36:53.937
He played the Prince Theo card.

36:53.997 --> 36:56.151
Good for him. What happened?

36:56.433 --> 36:58.789
Gwen scorched Roz on cross-examination.

36:58.849 --> 37:00.680
Stan got arrested for contempt.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.847
But the upshot is
the jury heard the prince's name

37:02.907 --> 37:04.235
before going off to deliberate.

37:04.295 --> 37:06.828
The question is,
did they believe it?

37:07.088 --> 37:08.497
I'm not counting on it.

37:08.941 --> 37:10.189
If we're gonna find something out here,

37:10.249 --> 37:11.224
we better find it fast,

37:11.284 --> 37:13.112
before they have a chance
to deliver a verdict.

37:13.172 --> 37:15.282
I just hope we're not
chasing ghosts, that's all.

37:15.342 --> 37:16.510
Jessica Marshall's earring

37:16.570 --> 37:17.953
didn't get here on its own, mate.

37:30.037 --> 37:31.047
Oh, my God.

37:31.107 --> 37:32.427
This is it, Natalie.

37:48.381 --> 37:50.413
Looks like the killer's done us a favor.

37:50.703 --> 37:53.459
Gift-wrapped her to preserve her DNA.

37:57.568 --> 37:58.656
Missing one earring.

37:58.716 --> 37:59.929
This has got to be her.

38:00.017 --> 38:01.856
That's Jessica Marshall, all right.

39:02.551 --> 39:03.500
Hello?

39:03.560 --> 39:04.896
I need to see you.

39:06.841 --> 39:07.943
Who is this?

39:08.003 --> 39:09.408
You know who this is.

39:10.212 --> 39:11.674
I need to see you.

39:11.738 --> 39:13.502
How the hell did you get my number?

39:13.562 --> 39:17.133
I need to see you right now.

39:17.193 --> 39:18.232
I'm sorry, I can't.

39:18.292 --> 39:19.867
You're not scared of me, are you?

39:19.927 --> 39:22.373
You can't believe
what they say in the press.

39:23.936 --> 39:25.528
I wouldn't hurt Molly.

39:26.082 --> 39:27.299
You know me.

39:27.456 --> 39:28.893
It's not that, okay?

39:28.953 --> 39:31.045
It's just... I have a real job now.

39:31.105 --> 39:33.091
I'll give you 10,000 pounds.

39:33.239 --> 39:34.365
Right now.

39:34.425 --> 39:36.171
In Chelsea, I have a flat.

39:37.059 --> 39:38.340
It's secure.

39:41.411 --> 39:42.636
No.

39:43.340 --> 39:46.139
I can't, okay? My boyfriend's
gonna be home any minute.

39:49.546 --> 39:50.749
Um...

39:52.275 --> 39:54.015
But I can do tomorrow.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.374
I can do tomorrow at 3:00.

39:59.434 --> 40:00.899
Tomorrow it is.

40:01.123 --> 40:02.414
3:00 p. m.

40:03.274 --> 40:04.179
The address is

40:04.239 --> 40:07.514
42 Golborne Road.

40:09.093 --> 40:10.543
I'll be there.

40:35.244 --> 40:36.443
Bed check.

40:38.431 --> 40:39.647
Bed check.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.200
Josh?

40:41.260 --> 40:42.496
Yeah, come here.

40:54.787 --> 40:56.001
Let's do it.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.980
On the way back to court,
when the verdict's in.

40:59.306 --> 41:00.696
We can disappear.

41:05.795 --> 41:08.311
That is, you know, if you still
want to go through with it.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.352
Get me out of here.
