city council candidate.

the American dream.

01:22.821 --> 01:25.476
1984, he immigrates
from Hong Kong

01:25.520 --> 01:27.870
with just enough
to open a store in Chinatown.

half the neighborhood.

the people of his community.

01:34.529 --> 01:37.706
- Truth is, he got his fortune
from human trafficking.

01:37.749 --> 01:39.708

kidnapped in China

01:39.751 --> 01:42.363

they're sold to a network

01:44.539 --> 01:46.323

in Chinatown.

a kickback for the labor.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.110
- Modern-day slavery.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.414

seems risky.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.503
I mean, doesn't that
open Quan up to exposure?

a lot of political pressure

01:55.071 --> 01:56.551

we have to directly connect him

02:13.089 --> 02:14.482
