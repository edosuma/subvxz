What is it going to take to make you
heed the warnings of this court?

01:19.788 --> 01:23.880
It is obvious to me that you are not
taking this matter seriously.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.923
I will not allow you to continue
to harass these people.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.178
Is that clear?

01:32.009 --> 01:35.138
If you violate this restraining order,
I assure you,

01:35.846 --> 01:39.191
you will spend 40 days in the county jail.

01:40.058 --> 01:40.934
I mean it.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.853
One more offense.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.070
What is obvious to this court

01:48.150 --> 01:50.614
is that you're in need of professional help

01:50.694 --> 01:52.992
and anger management counseling.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.243
This court has suggested
that you seek counseling,

01:57.326 --> 02:00.499
but since you can't
or won't do it voluntarily,

02:00.579 --> 02:03.754
I am requiring it as part
of your staying out of jail.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.793
Do I make myself clear?

02:09.211 --> 02:11.306
Do I make myself clear?

02:12.174 --> 02:13.050
Melinda?

02:14.718 --> 02:15.936
Yes, Your Honor.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.660
So,

02:37.157 --> 02:39.660
do you think you have an anger problem?

02:40.744 --> 02:43.168
Motherfucking right, I got an anger problem.

02:45.707 --> 02:49.086
Do you feel that
you're entitled to this anger?

02:53.382 --> 02:56.727
That's like asking me
if I'm entitled to being hungry.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.850
He caused all of this.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.393
All of it.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.021
It's not me. That son of a bitch owes me.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.606
What do you think he owes you?

03:08.689 --> 03:11.113
Every damn breath in his body.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.075
Why do you feel that way?

03:21.868 --> 03:23.916
You don't know what he did to me.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.085
You don't know.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.384
Would you like to share what he did?

03:30.127 --> 03:31.754
Do I have a choice?

03:32.421 --> 03:34.765
We all have choices.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.890
Not when some damn judge
is making me sit here.

03:41.138 --> 03:44.859
- You know what?
- This is bullshit, okay?

03:50.439 --> 03:55.411
This motherfucker torments me,
and he gets to walk away free.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.038
What are you writing?

04:03.118 --> 04:04.290
Just my notes.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.460
And what do your notes say?

04:09.875 --> 04:11.422
I'm a stereotype?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.964
Is that what you think you are?

04:15.046 --> 04:16.047
Hell, no!

04:19.384 --> 04:21.682
Sick and tired of hearing that.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.608
Every time a black woman gets mad,
she's a stereotype.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.357
"Ooh, she emasculates men."

04:30.437 --> 04:32.275
Is that what you think you did?

04:32.355 --> 04:33.197
Bitch...

04:34.107 --> 04:36.030
are you not listening to me?

04:37.694 --> 04:40.448
I never did anything to him.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.083
I was everything he needed me to be.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.256
I was...

04:52.459 --> 04:55.133
I was strong when he needed me to be.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.966
I played weak when he needed me to.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.139
I was pathetic.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.440
I was...

05:16.274 --> 05:19.028
Don't tell me I don't have
a right to be angry. Hmm?

05:19.778 --> 05:21.906
Is that what you think I said?

05:23.240 --> 05:25.243
I really don't give a damn what you said.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.496
But this is wrong.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.290
All of this is wrong.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.247
Why don't we do this?

05:30.872 --> 05:32.875
Why don't we just start from the beginning?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.504
Help me understand this injustice.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.384
Just tell me what happened.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.896
How far back do you wanna go?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.234
I remember every damn day.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.689
That's the problem.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.360
Can't forget it.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.239
I can't get it out of my head.

06:01.987 --> 06:02.829
So...

06:05.323 --> 06:07.075
How far do you wanna go?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.336
Well, let's start at the beginning.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.214
Okay.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.920
How'd you meet him?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.422
It was raining.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.847
<i>I was in college...</i>

06:21.715 --> 06:23.934
<i>and I was studying late.</i>

06:24.426 --> 06:26.269
<i>It was raining really hard.</i>

06:27.012 --> 06:30.266
<i>I don't know.
Crazy shit happens to me in the rain.</i>

06:30.724 --> 06:32.021
<i>Around water.</i>

06:33.435 --> 06:37.484
<i>I was trying to get back to my dorm,
and I ran into him.</i>

06:37.564 --> 06:39.191
- No!
- Damn!

06:39.274 --> 06:41.112
- No, no!
- You can't watch what you're doing?

06:41.192 --> 06:43.695
Move! You the idiot who bumped into me!

06:45.196 --> 06:46.618
Girl, what's wrong with you?

06:49.409 --> 06:50.251
Damn!

06:58.168 --> 06:59.169
Hi.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.845
Is Melissa here?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.431
There's no Melissa here.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.929
Oh, Melinda. Melinda's...

07:06.009 --> 07:07.180
What do you want?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.978
- Who's this?
- The asshole.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.476
I'm sorry. Here.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.808
I have some of your papers.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.689
Great. Just great.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.941
And I think you may have one or two of mine.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.989
No, I don't. Sorry.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.195
Here. Forgive her.
She's really bad at history,

07:24.277 --> 07:26.075
- and she had a paper to turn in today...
- Sarah!

07:27.489 --> 07:28.365
Goodbye.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.912
Look, I feel really bad
about bumping into you.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.586
I can be in my own head
when I'm working on a project.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.205
I'm sorry.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.459
Okay, yeah. Fine.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.128
But if you don't mind now,

07:38.208 --> 07:40.336
I have less than 24 hours to finish my paper.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.465
So, goodbye.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.551
Well, your basis is way off
in the first four pages,

07:44.631 --> 07:47.178
and the facts of
the Spanish-American War are wrong.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.477
And Professor Huff
will catch that in a second.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.558
How do you know that?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.185
I took his class last year.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.942
I'm sorry for reading your first pages.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.025
I got an A in his class.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.569
I can help you if you'd like.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.903
<i>I was so mad the first time I saw him</i>

08:05.986 --> 08:09.034
<i>that I didn't even realize
how handsome he was.</i>

08:09.114 --> 08:10.241
Please?

08:10.323 --> 08:12.162
<i>He was beautiful. Gotta give him that.</i>

08:12.242 --> 08:15.916
<i>The devil sure knows
how to put a package together.</i>

08:15.996 --> 08:20.045
<i>Standing in front of me
was all the things I loved.</i>

08:20.125 --> 08:22.753
<i>He was dark, sexy.</i>

08:23.378 --> 08:25.051
- It was 1497.
- No.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.383
Look, this is too hard for me to remember.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.511
Can we take a break?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.468
I don't wanna talk about this stuff anymore.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.679
You don't have much time.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.683
It's too much, okay?

08:33.763 --> 08:36.562
I'm on a brain overload.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.440
So, let's talk about you.

08:40.145 --> 08:43.443
Those papers you needed, what were they?

08:43.523 --> 08:44.445
Tell me.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.027
I think I've found a solution
to an age-old problem.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.989
I'm creating a battery
that can recharge itself.

08:50.947 --> 08:55.246
If it works, it can be used in cars,
homes, you name it.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.248
And I'm gonna be so rich.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.042
While saving the environment, of course.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.795
Of course.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.010
<i>He was so charming.</i>

09:04.461 --> 09:06.134
<i>So slick.</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:08.426
<i>I just wish to high heaven</i>

09:08.506 --> 09:12.261
<i>someone would have said to me
right then and there,</i>

09:12.343 --> 09:14.846
<i>"Girl, get up and run as fast as you can</i>

09:14.929 --> 09:18.728
<i>because this man will leave you devastated."</i>

09:18.808 --> 09:20.026
How'd you do?

09:20.351 --> 09:21.193
Tell me.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.065
But we studied.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.194
Yo, I'm sorry.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.988
Let me talk to Professor Huff.
Maybe we get you a make-up.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.195
No. No, okay?

09:29.277 --> 09:32.201
I mean, this is all just a waste of money.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.537
I can't keep doing this to my mother.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.661
To be honest with you, I mean,

09:37.744 --> 09:40.122
she was surprised I was even going to school.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.749
I wasn't as smart as my sisters.

09:44.626 --> 09:45.593
Come here.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.007
Melinda.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.971
Hey, what are you doing here?

09:56.054 --> 09:57.475
Mama...

09:57.555 --> 10:01.104
<i>My sisters came to tell me
that my mother had died.</i>

10:02.852 --> 10:05.525
<i>My mother and I always been close.</i>

10:05.605 --> 10:08.859
May she rest in peace. Amen.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.444
<i>I was numb.</i>

10:10.527 --> 10:12.996
<i>I was so desperate to feel anything.</i>

10:14.072 --> 10:15.449
<i>You see, that's how this happened.</i>

10:15.532 --> 10:19.162
<i>He was there at the right time
to take advantage of me.</i>

10:28.753 --> 10:29.716
Hi.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.967
I'm Brenda.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.299
Hey, I'm Robert.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.343
You have a last name?

10:34.425 --> 10:35.513
Gayle.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.345
- Hmm.
- How do you know Melinda?

10:38.721 --> 10:40.724
- School.
- Oh.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.729
Well, we haven't seen you around here.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.898
Yeah, I'm from Kirkwood.

10:44.978 --> 10:45.945
Oh.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.823
Well, this is a different side
of the tracks for you.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.117
What do you do for a living?

10:51.734 --> 10:53.073
I'm in school right now.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.116
Oh. That's good. That's good.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.038
Yeah.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.248
Well, if you don't have a job,
then who's paying for it?

11:01.744 --> 11:04.042
Student loans. Scholarships.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.249
That kind of thing.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.252
Oh. So you must be smart.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.629
Or an athlete.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.095
- No, no athlete.
- No? Oh.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.843
Oh. This is my boyfriend, Casey.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.637
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi, man.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.055
- Hey. Nice to meet you, man.
- Good to meet you, too.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.848
And this is Kalvin, Brenda's fiancé.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.100
- What's up, man?
- Good to meet you.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.351
Good to meet you as well.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.977
So what are you studying?

11:23.057 --> 11:24.434
Mechanical engineering.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.564
- Oh. Devon, come here.
- Hey.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.982
Hey.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.150
Sorry about your mom.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.276
Thank you so much.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.278
- How are you?
- I'm good.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.985
Oh. I'm so rude. Um...

11:34.068 --> 11:35.532
What's your name again?

11:35.612 --> 11:36.454
Robert.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.409
Robert. Robert, this is Devon.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.286
Devon, this is Robert.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.744
- Devon is Melinda's boyfriend.
- Nice to meet you.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.872
Ex-boyfriend.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.043
- You know she still loves you.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.091
Oh, Mel, look who came!

11:49.876 --> 11:50.798
Hey.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.091
I'm sorry about your mom.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.509
Thank you.

11:54.589 --> 11:57.217
Oh, uh, Devon, come with me for a second.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.677
Melinda, we have to thank the pastor.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.182
- You know him, right?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.230
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

12:19.030 --> 12:19.872
Robert!

12:20.490 --> 12:22.083
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.502
Why are you leaving so soon?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.372
Well, you have your family.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.172
I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.051
Thank you.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.378
Yeah.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.797
Of course.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.802
I'll see you later, all right?

12:40.885 --> 12:42.853
Wait, where are you going?

12:44.639 --> 12:45.686
To the train.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.980
The train? I mean, that's a long way.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.312
Did you walk here?

12:50.395 --> 12:51.858
You walked here? Look, no, I can just...

12:51.938 --> 12:53.065
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- I can drive you.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.319
No, no, look. I'll get my keys.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.112
I'll be right back, I'll drive you.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.410
Mel. Melin...

13:03.408 --> 13:05.126
Wow, is that your house?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.379
No. That's my house.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.542
You live in there?

13:12.959 --> 13:13.801
Yeah.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.679
Can I come in?

13:18.381 --> 13:19.223
Yeah.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.265
Watch your step.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.315
Thank you.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.196
What kind of music is this?

13:42.613 --> 13:43.831
Are you kidding me?

13:44.449 --> 13:45.325
What?

13:45.700 --> 13:47.168
This is Nina Simone.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.621
You've never heard of her?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.540
No.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.670
I need to play something
for you then. Hold on.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.421
- I'll pass.
- No, no, no.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.798
You have to hear her voice.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.676
Her singing is like going to church.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.094
Listen.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.598
It's kind of sad.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.142
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.226
You can leave it on.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.201
So how long have you lived here?

14:21.277 --> 14:22.199
A while.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.908
I know it's not much,
but my uncle left it to me,

14:26.991 --> 14:29.961
and my aunt lets me stay here
in the driveway for free.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.165
Where are your parents?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.125
My father's in prison.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.627
And my mother left me with my grandmother,

14:37.710 --> 14:40.179
who raised me until she died, when I was 14.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.803
Then I moved out here with my aunt,
and I've been living out here ever since.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.437
I'm sorry to hear about your mother.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.273
She sounded like a good lady.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.195
Yeah.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.782
Yeah, she was amazing.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.489
You know, she...

15:03.986 --> 15:05.113
It's okay.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.247
Come here.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.503
I'm sorry.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.251
<i>There was something about
the way he said he was sorry</i>

15:15.331 --> 15:16.674
<i>that made me believe it.</i>

15:16.999 --> 15:18.626
<i>And the way he held me.</i>

15:19.085 --> 15:20.882
<i>I know this sounds so stupid,</i>

15:20.962 --> 15:24.091
<i>but you have to know, I was a kid.</i>

15:24.173 --> 15:27.803
<i>He made me feel safe and strong and...</i>

15:27.885 --> 15:29.057
You're beautiful.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.229
<i>...beautiful.</i>

15:30.721 --> 15:33.475
<i>My mother wasn't even cold in the ground yet,</i>

15:33.558 --> 15:34.980
<i>and there I was.</i>

15:36.519 --> 15:39.734
<i>What kind of man takes advantage
of a girl's grief, huh?</i>

15:39.814 --> 15:40.815
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

15:40.898 --> 15:44.697
<i>A low-life maggot of a motherfucker,
that's who.</i>

15:44.777 --> 15:48.076
<i>He had to know that grief can leave you open</i>

15:48.156 --> 15:50.495
<i>to not knowing yourself at all.</i>

15:50.575 --> 15:53.203
<i>Add that to me being so young.</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:57.089
<i>He had my mind, my heart, my head...</i>

15:57.582 --> 15:59.420
<i>and, let's not forget...</i>

15:59.500 --> 16:00.797
<i>my virginity.</i>

16:23.316 --> 16:25.694
Oh. What are you listening to in here?

16:25.776 --> 16:27.779
You never heard of Nina Simone?

16:27.862 --> 16:29.659
Oh. That's Mama's music.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.241
Or it's that boy's.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.045
You going out with him again?

16:37.038 --> 16:38.000
Yeah.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.708
And I wish you would stop saying "him."

16:41.292 --> 16:45.341
His name is Robert,
and I really like him, okay?

16:45.421 --> 16:47.173
And I want you to like him, too.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.759
Are you having sex with him?

16:52.470 --> 16:53.972
Well, it's a fair question.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.648
But what I wanna know is,

16:56.724 --> 16:59.352
who's paying when
y'all going out on all these dates?

17:00.937 --> 17:01.779
What?

17:02.647 --> 17:04.115
Look, Melinda.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.987
Don't tell that boy

17:06.067 --> 17:08.069
that Mama left you that money and this house.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.119
- I'm telling you.
- All right.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.953
<i>Ugh. I hate to admit it,
but Brenda was right.</i>

17:18.371 --> 17:21.669
<i>I had made the mistake
of telling Robert about the house</i>

17:21.749 --> 17:25.049
<i>and the $350,000 that my mom left me.</i>

17:25.752 --> 17:27.800
<i>But that didn't matter to him, right?</i>

17:28.339 --> 17:29.557
<i>He wanted me.</i>

17:30.216 --> 17:31.058
<i>Right?</i>

17:31.509 --> 17:34.182
So the name of the company is called
Prescott & Howard Industries.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.099
Okay.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.728
And the owner, David Prescott,
is a super cool guy.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.687
Man, he's always looking
for the next big thing.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.564
And he's a tree-hugger billionaire

17:44.647 --> 17:46.569
always talking about
saving the environment, you know?

17:46.649 --> 17:48.821
So he finds people who just have great ideas

17:48.901 --> 17:51.700
and he changes their lives.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.200
You know, he's made millionaires
out of a lot of people

17:55.283 --> 17:57.705
just by investing in their project.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.081
And it's a lottery.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.084
He goes through the mail and finds ideas.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.837
But if he likes them,
then he contacts you for a meeting,

18:04.917 --> 18:08.341
and you have to come right when he says come,

18:08.421 --> 18:10.384
which is pretty cool.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.341
So I send a letter to his office every week

18:12.425 --> 18:14.514
talking about my battery idea.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.062
You know what I call it?

18:18.306 --> 18:19.728
The Gayle Wind.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.227
You know, my last name. Yeah.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.561
Okay, but, look.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.863
So is the battery, like, that powerful?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.315
Yeah.

18:27.398 --> 18:32.200
Yeah, well, I think you should call it
Gayle Force Wind.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.575
- Oh, man!
- Yeah?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.032
- I like that better.
- Yeah.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.207
I love that.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.247
I need to write it down.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.712
I'll be around to remind you.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.791
You promise?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.089
What, you planned on kickin' me out?

18:48.169 --> 18:49.011
No.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.007
Just a lot of disappointments, that's all.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.059
Mmm. I won't disappoint you.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.193
And I won't disappoint you.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.568
We're gonna be so rich.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.901
The Gayle Force Wind is gonna allow us
to live in that building right there,

19:11.984 --> 19:13.531
on the top floor.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.697
And we're gonna have one of those.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.827
What? A tugboat?

19:17.907 --> 19:19.034
No, a yacht.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.955
And I will name it the <i>Mrs. Gayle.</i>

19:21.035 --> 19:22.623
The <i>Mrs. Gayle?</i>

19:22.703 --> 19:25.252
Yeah, I'm gonna name it after you
when we get married.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.294
You're gonna be my wife forever.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.427
<i>"Forever." That's what he said.</i>

19:34.090 --> 19:37.185
<i>Those were his words. "Forever."</i>

19:37.843 --> 19:39.220
<i>And I believed him.</i>

19:39.303 --> 19:40.805
<i>I trusted him.</i>

19:40.888 --> 19:42.560
<i>I was so in love with him,</i>

19:42.640 --> 19:45.605
<i>I didn't see the con man for the con.</i>

19:45.685 --> 19:46.732
<i>Man!</i>

19:47.311 --> 19:49.900
We could have our first kid
before, like, the age of 28.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.358
And then we can have one,
like, right after, so...

19:52.441 --> 19:53.568
keep this body in shape.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.205
A little baby, I can't wait.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.957
Look, we're gonna have all the kids we want

20:01.659 --> 20:03.456
because we'll have all the money we want.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.290
- I sent another letter to Prescott, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.967
And I was thinking, what if he calls
and I have to wait for a bus?

20:11.085 --> 20:13.554
I mean, I can just drive you when he calls.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.470
What if you're not around?

20:17.174 --> 20:18.471
<i>You see the game?</i>

20:19.135 --> 20:22.600
<i>He had a way of not asking but suggesting</i>

20:22.680 --> 20:26.059
<i>to make me think
I wanted to do things for him.</i>

20:27.184 --> 20:28.686
<i>And wouldn't you know it?</i>

20:28.769 --> 20:33.235
<i>A few days after he got the car,
the only time I talked to him</i>

20:33.315 --> 20:35.283
<i>was when I called him.</i>

20:35.860 --> 20:40.785
<i>One day, I waited a whole day to see
if he would call me, and he didn't.</i>

20:40.865 --> 20:44.244
<i>So I waited two days,
and he still didn't call me.</i>

20:44.326 --> 20:45.289
<i>Melinda...</i>

20:45.369 --> 20:49.210
we need to tell you that now
that we're all married,

20:49.290 --> 20:50.792
we're gonna be moving out.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.131
- Okay.
- Thank you, babe.

20:54.211 --> 20:58.592
So, you need to get a job
so you can keep up this place.

21:00.926 --> 21:01.802
Yeah.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.061
Okay.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.058
I'll be right back.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.964
<i>Hello?</i>

21:35.044 --> 21:35.886
Hey.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.968
<i>Oh. Hey, there! How are you?</i>

21:39.048 --> 21:41.721
<i>"Hey, there. How are you?"</i>

21:41.801 --> 21:45.474
<i>Wait. Wait. Why the hell
was he talking to me like that?</i>

21:45.554 --> 21:48.018
I don't know. You tell me.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.645
<i>Oh. Nothing, baby.</i>

21:49.725 --> 21:51.814
<i>I've been working on my battery.</i>

21:51.894 --> 21:55.444
Okay, well, you haven't
called me in two days.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.610
<i>Well, you didn't call me.</i>

21:58.692 --> 22:00.281
<i>I thought you were busy.</i>

22:00.361 --> 22:01.488
Doing what?

22:01.570 --> 22:02.822
<i>I don't know.</i>

22:02.905 --> 22:05.119
<i>But, baby, I need both my hands
for this soldering.</i>

22:05.199 --> 22:06.701
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

22:06.784 --> 22:08.497
<i>You ever get that feeling</i>

22:08.577 --> 22:12.832
<i>when a man is telling you something,
and you know it's bullshit,</i>

22:12.915 --> 22:14.211
<i>but you just go with it?</i>

22:14.291 --> 22:15.755
Yeah. Yeah.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.761
<i>Well, I knew this was bullshit,
and I tried to go with it.</i>

22:21.841 --> 22:24.094
<i>But as nice as I could be,</i>

22:24.176 --> 22:27.146
<i>there was also another side to me
that he hadn't met yet.</i>

22:28.222 --> 22:29.974
<i>If he was lying to me,</i>

22:30.057 --> 22:33.481
<i>maybe it was time for me
to introduce him to my bitch.</i>

22:33.561 --> 22:36.690
<i>And, I mean, she's a motherfucker.</i>

22:38.899 --> 22:40.401
<i>Call it women's intuition.</i>

22:40.484 --> 22:42.236
<i>I don't know. Call it whatever.</i>

22:42.319 --> 22:45.823
<i>All I know is that something
made me drive over there.</i>

22:45.906 --> 22:49.747
<i>Not only did I drive over there,
but the same thing that made me drive</i>

22:49.827 --> 22:53.297
<i>told me to park across the street
and not get too close.</i>

22:54.540 --> 22:59.215
<i>After sitting there for almost an hour,
I felt kind of stupid.</i>

22:59.295 --> 23:01.342
<i>I was trying to talk myself</i>

23:01.422 --> 23:03.844
<i>out of the voice that was deep inside myself.</i>

23:03.924 --> 23:05.767
<i>That was myself.</i>

23:06.260 --> 23:08.849
<i>I started thinking, "How dumb is this?</i>

23:08.929 --> 23:11.393
<i>Oh, God. This looks desperate."</i>

23:11.473 --> 23:14.313
<i>There I was, sitting outside
of a man's house...</i>

23:14.393 --> 23:15.689
<i>well, RV...</i>

23:15.769 --> 23:18.022
<i>trying to see if he's lying to me.</i>

23:18.731 --> 23:21.195
<i>I already knew he was lying!</i>

23:21.275 --> 23:23.364
<i>It was in my damn gut!</i>

23:23.444 --> 23:26.789
<i>And here I am trying to confirm
what I already knew.</i>

23:27.990 --> 23:29.328
<i>I'm not doing this.</i>

23:45.633 --> 23:48.512
<i>There is something about my crazy.</i>

23:49.345 --> 23:50.516
<i>It's blind.</i>

23:50.596 --> 23:51.809
<i>It's not rational.</i>

23:51.889 --> 23:54.061
<i>It rages. It doesn't stop.</i>

23:54.141 --> 23:56.564
<i>It doesn't subside. It doesn't quit.</i>

23:56.644 --> 23:57.771
<i>It's immediate.</i>

24:13.494 --> 24:14.790
Robert, what was that?

24:14.870 --> 24:16.713
I don't know. Are you okay?

24:32.554 --> 24:33.976
This what you do to me?

24:34.431 --> 24:35.558
- Huh?
- Give me your hand.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.439
Is this what you do to me?

24:38.894 --> 24:40.146
Is this what you do to me?

24:40.229 --> 24:42.276
- Melinda! Melinda!
- This is what you do to me?

24:42.356 --> 24:43.983
And then you lying with this bitch!

24:44.066 --> 24:44.988
Melinda!

24:45.234 --> 24:46.076
Yeah!

24:46.485 --> 24:47.323
What you looking at, bitch?

24:47.403 --> 24:49.656
You didn't tell me
you were in a relationship, Robert!

24:49.738 --> 24:51.240
- Go!
- What you looking at? Yeah!

24:51.323 --> 24:53.412
- Stop, stop! Please!
- Don't touch me!

24:53.492 --> 24:55.289
- Please, what? Please, what?
- Come on, please!

24:55.369 --> 24:56.332
- Please!
- Please, what?

24:56.412 --> 24:57.875
Stop it. Stop it!

24:57.955 --> 24:59.628
- Let go of me!
- Stop!

25:00.374 --> 25:04.004
You're bleeding. We gotta stop the bleeding.

25:04.461 --> 25:05.883
Christ. Melinda.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.720
Melinda! Melinda!

25:10.175 --> 25:11.051
Fuck!

25:12.136 --> 25:14.764
<i>I had so much adrenaline that I didn't know</i>

25:14.847 --> 25:18.272
<i>I slammed my body against
the steering wheel so hard.</i>

25:19.685 --> 25:21.106
<i>Internal bleeding.</i>

25:21.186 --> 25:23.940
<i>And worse, ruptured ovaries.</i>

25:24.773 --> 25:28.277
<i>A full hysterectomy,
and I wasn't even 21 years old.</i>

25:29.153 --> 25:31.577
<i>Children, never.</i>

25:36.201 --> 25:38.545
No. No, no.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.500
So you cheat on her, you take her money,

25:42.583 --> 25:45.798
she buys you a car, and you do that?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.005
You do that?

25:47.421 --> 25:49.134
She better be all right.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.091
That's all I know, you know?

25:51.175 --> 25:52.722
- Hey, hey...
- Just get out!

25:53.177 --> 25:54.515
Get out of here!

25:54.595 --> 25:56.563
- Get out of here!
- Maybe it's best you leave.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.232
You're not welcome here!

25:59.933 --> 26:01.401
- Get out!
- Go.

26:05.439 --> 26:06.657
I'll call you.

26:07.441 --> 26:08.488
I'll call you.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.653
How could he do this to her?

26:10.736 --> 26:12.825
How could he do that to her?

26:12.905 --> 26:15.124
<i>I was laid up for three weeks.</i>

26:16.116 --> 26:17.993
<i>I was in so much pain.</i>

26:18.911 --> 26:20.038
Melinda, you've been doing this

26:20.120 --> 26:21.792
- since you were a little girl.
- Yes.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.669
You get mad and nothing matters.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.467
You have to stop doing that.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.048
I know.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.963
<i>I did know that.</i>

26:29.046 --> 26:31.593
<i>For some reason, I couldn't control it,</i>

26:31.673 --> 26:34.392
<i>any more than I could control
how I was feeling about him.</i>

26:34.927 --> 26:38.851
<i>I soon realized that most of
my pain wasn't physical. It was...</i>

26:38.931 --> 26:39.898
Melinda!

26:41.683 --> 26:43.105
No, no, no. Look,

26:43.602 --> 26:45.229
you have to let him talk to me.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.985
Please? I just want to know why.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.237
Baby, sometimes men don't have a why.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.364
No. They just got a bunch of lies.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.118
June, can you go get him for me? Please?

26:57.991 --> 27:00.995
He ain't coming in here
to do nothing but lie to you.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.542
He probably just broke and hungry
and needs some more money.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.044
Why don't you just let him get it

27:05.124 --> 27:07.468
from the whore you just caught him with, huh?

27:13.924 --> 27:16.268
Can we have a moment, please?

27:18.053 --> 27:18.895
Please?

27:19.346 --> 27:21.685
We will be right on
the other side of this door.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.358
Okay. All right.

27:24.768 --> 27:25.690
Come on.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.623
I'm so sorry, baby.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.746
I don't even know why I was with her.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.748
She didn't mean nothing to me.

27:42.828 --> 27:43.704
Nothing.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.416
It was just sex.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.001
<i>And here we go.</i>

27:49.084 --> 27:52.463
<i>How many times has a woman
heard this bullshit?</i>

27:52.546 --> 27:56.392
And I felt so bad because
you been there for me.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.772
I love you. Just you.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.392
I'm sick without you.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.776
I need you.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.523
<i>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...</i>

28:11.106 --> 28:13.029
<i>I promise I won't do it again.</i>

28:14.067 --> 28:17.616
<i>And somehow, that shit always worked.</i>

28:17.696 --> 28:18.948
<i>Until it didn't.</i>

28:19.823 --> 28:23.497
<i>After all, he had me by a four-letter word.</i>

28:23.577 --> 28:24.624
<i>Love.</i>

28:25.412 --> 28:27.164
<i>And I did love him.</i>

28:27.247 --> 28:31.088
<i>And that part I couldn't help,
no matter what he did.</i>

28:31.168 --> 28:34.672
<i>Love is a bitch when she's chained
to a tormentor.</i>

28:35.255 --> 28:40.261
<i>And when that tormentor is a con man,
well, what do you do?</i>

28:40.761 --> 28:43.105
<i>Just wait for the next con.</i>

28:43.513 --> 28:44.560
What?

28:44.640 --> 28:45.687
What is it?

28:47.893 --> 28:49.395
I lost my scholarship.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.648
And I don't have a way of paying for it.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.233
I can't get a student loan.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.193
It's too late, so...

29:02.282 --> 29:04.410
How much are your last two semesters?

29:04.493 --> 29:07.916
<i>Yep... You heard me.</i>
<i>My dumb ass paid</i>

29:07.996 --> 29:10.961
<i>for his two final semesters of school.</i>

29:11.041 --> 29:14.796
<i>I was still with my man, holding him down.</i>
<i>You know?</i>

29:14.878 --> 29:17.676
<i>My lying, cheating, son of a bitch of a man.</i>

29:17.756 --> 29:19.303
- <i>There I was.</i>
- You sure?

29:20.842 --> 29:23.186
<i>I couldn't even believe I said it.</i>

29:24.429 --> 29:28.059
<i>You don't have to judge me,
I'm my own jury. Okay?</i>

29:28.141 --> 29:31.395
<i>And I had already convicted
and sentenced myself.</i>

29:31.478 --> 29:33.902
<i>I was guilty of stupidity.</i>

29:34.731 --> 29:37.280
<i>So guess what he did</i>
<i>when I wrote that check?</i>

29:37.734 --> 29:39.156
<i>You guessed it.</i>

29:39.528 --> 29:41.656
<i>The bastard didn't even have a ring.</i>

29:42.572 --> 29:43.824
This is temporary.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.494
One day, I'm going to replace it
with three diamonds.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.963
One big one in the center for our love,

29:50.872 --> 29:52.836
and a yellow one on this side

29:52.916 --> 29:55.214
to remind us to always look towards the sun.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.131
And a chocolate one on this side
that reminds us

29:59.172 --> 30:00.924
that there may be dark times ahead.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.885
<i>And then I heard myself say...</i>

30:03.302 --> 30:04.264
Yes!

30:04.344 --> 30:05.846
Yes! Yes!

30:17.065 --> 30:20.569
That man cheated on you and you almost died.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.325
What happens when he does something
to you the next time?

30:23.405 --> 30:24.368
There won't be...

30:24.448 --> 30:26.826
No, don't say there won't be a next time.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.411
That man is throwing out
all kinds of red flags,

30:29.494 --> 30:31.747
and now you wanna just go and marry him?

30:32.914 --> 30:35.292
I can't and I will not stand for this!

30:36.376 --> 30:39.676
If you go, and you go and do that,
I won't be there!

30:41.381 --> 30:42.223
I won't.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.222
June.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.435
- This is a mistake.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:50.724 --> 30:51.816
<i>And yet,</i>

30:52.309 --> 30:54.273
<i>there I was, walking down the aisle</i>

30:54.353 --> 30:57.653
<i>with more questions in my head
than petals in my bouquet.</i>

30:58.940 --> 31:01.280
<i>I couldn't help but look over
at the empty seats</i>

31:01.360 --> 31:03.863
<i>where my sisters should have been sitting.</i>

31:03.945 --> 31:05.697
<i>I couldn't believe they didn't come.</i>

31:05.781 --> 31:07.202
<i>But I should have understood,</i>

31:07.282 --> 31:10.411
<i>seeing as how I wasn't even sure
why I was there.</i>

31:10.869 --> 31:12.746
<i>There was Sarah at the altar,</i>

31:12.829 --> 31:14.627
<i>my maid of honor, cheering us on.</i>

31:15.374 --> 31:17.798
<i>She loved the thought of us.
I guess I did, too.</i>

31:18.251 --> 31:22.302
<i>But the thought of us was better
than the reality of us.</i>

31:23.548 --> 31:28.020
<i>And there was Robert,
standing at the altar, smiling...</i>

31:29.304 --> 31:32.103
<i>as I walked, moth to a flame.</i>

31:33.642 --> 31:37.065
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.239
You may kiss the bride.

31:42.526 --> 31:43.778
<i>Burned.</i>

31:47.406 --> 31:51.331
<i>Years ticked by like seconds
on that big clock in my mother's hallway.</i>

31:51.993 --> 31:54.291
<i>And with every tick,
there was a subtraction sign</i>

31:54.371 --> 31:55.834
<i>from the account for something.</i>

31:55.914 --> 31:59.004
<i>Something he needed,
supplies for his battery,</i>

31:59.084 --> 32:02.179
<i>books for research, metals, plastics.
Always something.</i>

32:03.004 --> 32:06.678
<i>And as the money got low,
so did his affection for me,</i>

32:06.758 --> 32:09.512
<i>his tolerance of me,</i>

32:10.720 --> 32:12.097
<i>his patience.</i>

32:12.722 --> 32:13.564
<i>Damn.</i>

32:14.015 --> 32:16.063
<i>Did I just say I was being tolerated?</i>

32:20.397 --> 32:22.149
I need you to see this.

32:22.232 --> 32:23.859
I mean, I'm worried.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.570
Is this right?

32:27.237 --> 32:28.238
Yeah.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.656
Damn.

32:30.991 --> 32:32.162
I'll get a job, babe.

32:32.242 --> 32:33.619
I'll try to help out.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.332
<i>"Try"?</i>

32:35.412 --> 32:37.501
<i>I couldn't believe
that bastard just said "try."</i>

32:37.581 --> 32:39.503
But you know it's gonna be
hard for me to study

32:39.583 --> 32:41.381
and work, and work on this.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.464
But I'll try. I mean, I will. I will.

32:45.547 --> 32:48.387
<i>For some reason, I just smiled.</i>

32:48.467 --> 32:49.679
I just need a little more time.

32:49.759 --> 32:50.601
Okay.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.735
- Hi, Ms. Hilderbran?
- Yes.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.116
- My name is Robert Gayle.
- I know who you are.

33:09.196 --> 33:11.449
Will you please stop calling
and writing letters?

33:12.407 --> 33:14.996
That's not how this works.
It won't get you seen.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.040
It's a lottery system for a reason.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.497
I know, but could you just...

33:23.376 --> 33:26.926
<i>Sarah helped me get a job
in her office as an office assistant.</i>

33:32.427 --> 33:34.724
They need these by morning.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.181
- Sorry.
- Sarah.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.141
It's good overtime.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.857
<i>I was actually working two jobs.</i>

33:41.937 --> 33:43.233
<i>I would leave there</i>

33:43.313 --> 33:45.156
<i>and clean offices at night.</i>

33:45.857 --> 33:47.109
<i>Anything I had to do</i>

33:47.192 --> 33:49.656
<i>to keep from having
to ask my sisters for anything.</i>

33:49.736 --> 33:50.612
<i>I just...</i>

33:51.196 --> 33:53.449
<i>I just had to get through
the next year, you know?</i>

33:53.990 --> 33:57.165
<i>I thought, "Just work hard, girl,
this man loves you."</i>

34:08.255 --> 34:09.097
Yes!

34:12.425 --> 34:13.391
Yes!

34:22.768 --> 34:23.610
Yes!

34:38.243 --> 34:39.581
- Robert.
- Baby!

34:39.661 --> 34:42.333
Robert, you have every light on
in this house.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.041
The light bill was &300 last month!

34:44.123 --> 34:45.462
Baby, this won't run up the light bill.

34:45.542 --> 34:48.130
This is my battery working.
It's running the whole house.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.175
Robert, did you talk to an electrician?

34:50.255 --> 34:51.382
Why?

34:53.675 --> 34:54.802
Oh, my God!

35:01.641 --> 35:02.984
Sorry.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.523
<i>Not only did he almost
burn down my mother's house,</i>

35:07.606 --> 35:09.153
<i>he burned up all the wiring.</i>

35:09.441 --> 35:10.533
It almost worked.

35:10.775 --> 35:14.074
<i>Cost to repair? $37,000.</i>

35:14.154 --> 35:15.201
<i>That was it.</i>

35:16.197 --> 35:17.410
<i>We were in the hole.</i>

35:17.490 --> 35:18.992
At least I didn't break nothing.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.041
<i>Thomas Fry.</i>

35:23.121 --> 35:26.375
<i>But then the day came
that I had been waiting for.</i>

35:27.167 --> 35:29.089
<i>Robert Gayle.</i>

35:31.671 --> 35:34.299
<i>I was so happy.</i>

35:34.382 --> 35:38.057
<i>I thought for sure that the very next day,
our lives would change.</i>

35:38.470 --> 35:41.064
<i>I thought all of our troubles were over.</i>

35:41.556 --> 35:43.770
<i>I mean, he had three job interviews.</i>

35:43.850 --> 35:47.025
<i>Each started at $150,000 a year.</i>

35:47.937 --> 35:49.609
<i>I was so excited.</i>

35:49.689 --> 35:50.652
<i>But...</i>

35:50.732 --> 35:52.821
How could all three turn you down?

35:52.901 --> 35:54.278
I mean, they recruited you.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.247
When I was 15,

35:58.490 --> 36:01.244
I was in a gang,
and we robbed a grocery store.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.628
I got charged as an adult,

36:04.037 --> 36:06.506
and I spent two years in jail.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.210
I thought I could get it
expunged off my record

36:10.293 --> 36:12.967
since I was only 15, but it's still there...

36:14.881 --> 36:17.009
and no one will hire a felon.

36:17.926 --> 36:21.516
<i>You have no idea how much
I was looking forward to a break.</i>

36:21.596 --> 36:23.098
<i>Room to breathe, you know?</i>

36:23.181 --> 36:27.147
<i>To relax. Let him take care of me
for a change.</i>

36:27.227 --> 36:29.230
<i>But there I was, hearing this.</i>

36:29.729 --> 36:30.900
<i>A felon.</i>

36:30.980 --> 36:32.357
<i>And now he tells me?</i>

36:32.440 --> 36:34.909
<i>This motherfucker says this to me now!</i>

36:35.485 --> 36:37.282
<i>The con game. You see?</i>

36:37.362 --> 36:39.326
Baby, it's not the end of the world.

36:40.657 --> 36:41.954
Look, I have an idea.

36:42.450 --> 36:45.204
I figured out all the bugs,
and now it's even better than ever.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.583
I just need to get it to Prescott.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.165
I know he'll love it, okay?

36:48.248 --> 36:49.461
I'm still sending letters.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.668
I'm going by and I'm calling.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.002
And I'm gonna call his secretary.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.088
I know we're low on money.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.174
But I was thinking, if we mortgage the house,

36:57.257 --> 36:59.095
we can pay for the rest
of my research on this

36:59.175 --> 37:00.639
and make it top notch, a new design.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.392
I know it'll work.

37:03.012 --> 37:05.982
Okay. Mel, look at me. I know it'll work.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.817
- No.
- Come on.

37:08.309 --> 37:09.982
Don't stop believing in me now.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.026
Please trust me.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.859
It's gonna work, I know it will.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.034
<i>What the hell?</i>

37:17.944 --> 37:22.285
<i>I felt like my back was against the wall
and I had no choice, you know?</i>

37:22.365 --> 37:24.037
<i>I couldn't keep doing this.</i>

37:24.117 --> 37:25.664
<i>I couldn't keep working like this.</i>

37:25.744 --> 37:26.706
Come on.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.584
<i>So I had to fall for the con.</i>

37:29.122 --> 37:31.591
<i>I was in too deep to stop and walk away.</i>

37:32.625 --> 37:34.753
<i>So guess what my stupid ass did.</i>

37:36.212 --> 37:37.759
<i>My mama's house.</i>

37:38.506 --> 37:42.602
<i>A house that was paid for,
that she left to me.</i>

37:43.178 --> 37:47.058
<i>The house that she had worked
her entire life to pay for.</i>

37:48.558 --> 37:49.810
<i>I mortgaged it.</i>

37:58.026 --> 37:59.278
Melinda!

38:01.154 --> 38:04.283
<i>Working to keep my sisters
from knowing what I had done.</i>

38:05.950 --> 38:08.665
<i>And every time I would see him
sleeping in the bed</i>

38:08.745 --> 38:10.667
<i>when I was headed to one of my two jobs,</i>

38:10.747 --> 38:12.624
<i>I would get mad, you know?</i>

38:12.707 --> 38:14.459
<i>I would get resentful.</i>

38:15.627 --> 38:18.597
<i>And this was my routine every day.</i>

38:24.052 --> 38:27.056
<i>To the bastard's credit,
he did get odd jobs from time to time.</i>

38:27.138 --> 38:28.184
<i>But they...</i>

38:28.264 --> 38:31.768
<i>They didn't even cover the utilities
most of the time.</i>

38:33.269 --> 38:36.568
<i>How do two people live through two decades
and miss everything?</i>

38:36.648 --> 38:38.446
<i>Every moment of it?</i>

38:39.275 --> 38:40.613
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

38:40.693 --> 38:42.115
<i>You just feel trapped.</i>

38:42.737 --> 38:45.536
<i>But fuck that. This trap wouldn't destroy me.</i>

38:46.115 --> 38:47.242
<i>Or did it?</i>

38:49.035 --> 38:51.629
<i>One of the saddest parts
of our lives was that</i>

38:52.163 --> 38:53.752
<i>we were just existing.</i>

38:53.832 --> 38:56.254
<i>No coloring outside of the lines,
no excitement,</i>

38:56.334 --> 38:59.964
<i>no birth of a child to mark our age,</i>

39:00.046 --> 39:04.597
<i>or his or her first step,
or his or her graduation.</i>

39:05.260 --> 39:08.514
<i>Nothing to be a mile-marker
for the years that were passing.</i>

39:09.180 --> 39:10.807
<i>There were no warning signs.</i>

39:11.766 --> 39:14.235
<i>Eighteen years seemed to pass like days.</i>

39:15.436 --> 39:17.234
<i>How does that happen?</i>

39:29.659 --> 39:30.501
Diana.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.625
Wow. You look great.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.082
Robert Gayle.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.086
How have you been?

39:37.166 --> 39:38.254
I've been good.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.547
God, I haven't seen you since...

39:39.627 --> 39:41.129
Yeah, yeah.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.183
She destroyed your RV.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.096
I don't blame her though.

39:47.176 --> 39:48.389
You should have been honest.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.687
We were kids.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.560
No, but you lied to me also, Robert.
I didn't know about her.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.354
Yeah, I know, I know, I'm sorry.

39:54.434 --> 39:56.778
Anyway, whatever happened to her?

39:57.687 --> 39:59.025
I married her.

39:59.105 --> 39:59.947
Okay.

40:00.648 --> 40:01.861
So what are you doing here?

40:01.941 --> 40:03.363
Yeah, well, get this.

40:03.443 --> 40:06.696
I've been sending letters to Prescott here
for years, telling him about my battery.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.531
You remember, in school,
what I was working on?

40:10.033 --> 40:11.621
No, sorry, I don't.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.704
Well, anyway, I've been trying to get
a meeting with him,

40:13.786 --> 40:15.834
and I found out that Ms. Hilderbran retired

40:15.914 --> 40:17.291
and that you took her place...

40:17.373 --> 40:19.420
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.128
So I figured this must be God
helping me out, you know?

40:22.754 --> 40:25.724
No, it's not God. I can't help you.

40:26.549 --> 40:27.596
What? Why?

40:28.051 --> 40:31.180
No, I can't. We have new policies now
about receiving information.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.889
But look, Robert, it was really...

40:32.972 --> 40:34.599
It was nice to see you.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.939
Can I take you for a coffee sometime,
maybe catch up?

40:38.019 --> 40:39.987
Yeah, sure, if you invite your wife.

40:40.730 --> 40:43.108
Look, I do not cheat on my wife.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.362
I don't do that.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.738
This is strictly business.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.365
I can't help you.

40:47.737 --> 40:48.783
- Look, I know.
- I'm sorry.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.740
I know, I understand. I just...

40:51.950 --> 40:53.702
I just need some advice, that's all.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.508
Okay, look. Here's my card.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.756
I usually grab coffee at Q & A

41:03.836 --> 41:06.384
on 52nd Street in the mornings
at about 7:00 a.m.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.842
- If you happen to be there...
- Yeah.

41:08.925 --> 41:11.428
...then maybe we can talk, okay?

41:11.511 --> 41:13.933
Okay, thanks. Maybe I'll catch you there.

41:14.013 --> 41:14.855
Okay.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.779
Carly, can you get me the file
on Robert Gayle?

41:22.313 --> 41:24.235
You want the file on the psycho

41:24.315 --> 41:27.488
who's been sending letters here
since before I was born?

41:27.568 --> 41:28.990
That's what I said.

41:30.405 --> 41:31.247
Sure.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.456
Thank you.

41:41.666 --> 41:42.508
Hello?

41:42.792 --> 41:44.005
<i>Robert Gayle?</i>

41:44.085 --> 41:45.086
Yeah.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.591
<i>My name is Melvin White.</i>

41:46.671 --> 41:49.390
<i>I'm the head of security
for Prescott & Howard Industries.</i>

41:49.674 --> 41:50.845
<i>I'm calling to inform you</i>

41:50.925 --> 41:53.514
<i>that you've been put into our system
as a credible threat.</i>

41:53.594 --> 41:55.308
<i>You are not to send
another letter to our office,</i>

41:55.388 --> 41:58.061
<i>nor contact or visit
any one of our employees.</i>

41:58.141 --> 42:00.769
<i>You're not to come within
300 yards of our campus.</i>

42:00.852 --> 42:03.276
<i>If you come near the building again,
you will be arrested.</i>

42:09.152 --> 42:09.994
Fuck!

42:12.321 --> 42:13.197
Damn it!

42:22.707 --> 42:24.004
What happened?

42:27.879 --> 42:29.592
They won't see me.

42:29.672 --> 42:31.844
Prescott. They won't see me!

42:31.924 --> 42:33.551
Okay? They won't!

42:34.510 --> 42:38.810
All these years wasted!

42:45.646 --> 42:48.611
Damn it. I wanted this for us, baby.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.989
I wanted it to work for us.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.747
I wanted to get you that ring.

42:55.323 --> 42:58.413
The apartment, the boat, the private jet.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.336
I wanted you to have it all.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.043
I wanted you to have it all.

43:10.463 --> 43:12.591
Have you ever asked me what I wanted?

43:16.636 --> 43:18.889
I just want you to get a job,

43:20.098 --> 43:22.567
help me out consistently, that's all.

43:25.770 --> 43:29.570
Now that we know this battery
is not going to work...

43:31.943 --> 43:33.786
we can put it away, okay?

43:34.362 --> 43:35.908
Because that's over.

43:35.988 --> 43:37.160
That's it.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.459
Move on. Let's just move on.

43:40.368 --> 43:41.415
Okay?

43:42.662 --> 43:44.039
I know this could work.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.795
Please.

43:46.332 --> 43:47.174
Please.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.511
Please. Come on.

43:51.170 --> 43:52.592
Just a job.

43:55.925 --> 43:56.801
Okay?

43:57.927 --> 43:58.769
Yeah.

44:02.431 --> 44:04.308
I'll find the best job I can.

44:11.232 --> 44:12.279
Baby.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.244
If you give up on me now, I got nothing left.

44:22.577 --> 44:23.999
Tell me you love me.

44:28.457 --> 44:29.584
I love you.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.219
I do.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.638
But I'm so tired.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.220
I'm so tired.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.306
<i>Go, go. It's recording.</i>

44:43.389 --> 44:46.854
<i>Hi, my name is Robert Gayle,
and this is my wife, Mel.</i>

44:46.934 --> 44:49.232
<i>Hi, I'm Melinda Gayle.</i>

44:49.312 --> 44:52.191
<i>And we are excited to show you
my new invention!</i>

44:52.273 --> 44:55.277
<i>It's called the Gayle Force Wind.</i>

44:55.359 --> 44:57.362
<i>And it's powering this room right now.</i>

45:00.698 --> 45:01.665
Melinda?

45:02.867 --> 45:04.085
Melinda?

45:09.790 --> 45:11.212
Hey.

45:12.501 --> 45:15.300
Did you know this house
was about to be foreclosed on?

45:17.215 --> 45:18.057
Did you?

45:18.716 --> 45:20.179
That damn Audra at the bank.

45:20.259 --> 45:22.603
She's not supposed to be telling my business.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.438
Mel, that's our cousin.

45:25.389 --> 45:28.268
Did you know this house
was about to be foreclosed on?

45:30.561 --> 45:32.438
Yeah, I was just getting
my battery ready for...

45:32.521 --> 45:34.235
We all know about that damn battery.

45:34.315 --> 45:35.611
That shit ain't never gonna work.

45:35.691 --> 45:36.818
It's a joke.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.532
Get a job and help her.

45:39.612 --> 45:41.576
- Baby, that's enough, okay?
- Yes, Brenda, stop it.

45:41.656 --> 45:43.033
We need to be able to talk about this.

45:43.115 --> 45:45.288
Melinda, this is Mama's house.

45:45.368 --> 45:46.914
We grew up here.

45:46.994 --> 45:49.167
And you mortgaged it for him?

45:49.247 --> 45:51.043
His ass needs a job.

45:51.123 --> 45:53.296
Why are you putting up with this shit, huh?

45:53.376 --> 45:54.672
- Why?
- Brenda, let up...

45:54.752 --> 45:56.004
Move, Kalvin.

45:57.004 --> 46:00.008
The things our daddy did to keep this house.

46:00.091 --> 46:02.094
And you gonna lose it?

46:02.677 --> 46:03.848
I knew this would happen.

46:03.928 --> 46:05.725
- Okay, okay. Listen.
- I knew it.

46:05.805 --> 46:07.852
We know the problem,
and we know you don't have the money.

46:07.932 --> 46:09.353
So Audra told you that, too?

46:09.433 --> 46:11.731
Mel, we're trying to help you.
Just listen. We have a plan.

46:11.811 --> 46:13.814
Babe, tell her the plan.

46:13.896 --> 46:18.070
Look, Kalvin and I went to the owners
of one of the restaurants we deliver for.

46:18.150 --> 46:20.615
He will advance us money
for future deliveries

46:20.695 --> 46:22.072
three weeks at a time.

46:22.154 --> 46:24.782
But if we mess this up,
he'll take our trucks.

46:24.865 --> 46:26.913
I do not like this at all.

46:26.993 --> 46:28.831
Baby, it's all right.
We're just trying to help.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.750
We worked our asses off for those trucks.

46:30.830 --> 46:31.957
Baby, stop!

46:32.832 --> 46:33.799
Just listen.

46:35.334 --> 46:36.461
Look, man.

46:36.752 --> 46:40.177
All we need you to do is help us
keep the requirements, all right?

46:41.215 --> 46:44.013
You gotta drive and you gotta
be on time to his chains.

46:44.093 --> 46:45.220
That's all.

46:45.303 --> 46:47.642
We can get this paid back in, like,
three months.

46:47.722 --> 46:48.849
But you can't be late.

46:48.931 --> 46:51.685
You can't miss a delivery or a pickup,
or we'll lose everything.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.019
Everything!

46:54.603 --> 46:56.856
- And we can't pay you.
- And we shouldn't do it.

46:56.939 --> 46:59.737
He don't give a damn about nothing
and nobody but himself.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.864
Look, promise us that you'll do this, Robert.

47:01.944 --> 47:03.947
And you'll do this right.

47:04.030 --> 47:05.282
Promise us.

47:10.828 --> 47:11.670
Yeah.

47:12.830 --> 47:13.672
I'm in.

47:14.498 --> 47:16.170
See, he's in.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.844
I'll see you at the lot
at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

47:19.337 --> 47:20.304
I'm there.

47:21.130 --> 47:22.718
And I'm changing the locks.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.512
Mel, we're just trying to help.

47:24.592 --> 47:25.638
Mmm-hmm.

47:25.718 --> 47:27.181
She gotta want to help herself.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.262
You're right.

47:28.346 --> 47:29.308
- Have a good night.
- 6:00 a.m.

47:29.388 --> 47:31.061
He'll be there. Just go.

47:37.313 --> 47:40.158
You know why I know how you don't
love me the same?

47:42.026 --> 47:44.450
You didn't even try to defend me.

47:50.117 --> 47:53.087
<i>That bastard actually said that to me.</i>

47:53.996 --> 47:55.839
<i>He actually said that.</i>

48:33.702 --> 48:35.041
<i>Another morning.</i>

48:35.121 --> 48:36.543
<i>No kiss, no hug.</i>

48:37.081 --> 48:38.173
Good morning.

48:39.875 --> 48:42.173
<i>Another night of him sleeping downstairs.</i>

48:44.255 --> 48:45.973
<i>At first, I was sad about it.</i>

48:47.174 --> 48:48.892
<i>Then I started to get mad.</i>

48:49.593 --> 48:51.182
<i>It's good.</i>

48:51.262 --> 48:53.726
Right? I mean, it's good.
At least he's working.

48:53.806 --> 48:55.024
Yeah, right.

48:56.434 --> 48:58.230
He's so mad at me, though.

48:58.310 --> 48:59.402
- Is he?
- Yeah.

49:00.396 --> 49:02.318
He's not touching me.

49:02.398 --> 49:04.150
He sleeps downstairs.

49:04.233 --> 49:05.654
We haven't had sex in months.

49:05.734 --> 49:06.735
Really?

49:06.819 --> 49:08.282
Yeah, it's like we're roommates.

49:08.362 --> 49:11.912
Well... Hey. At least
he's a roommate with a job.

49:12.783 --> 49:13.704
Right.

49:13.784 --> 49:14.785
Yep.

49:15.369 --> 49:17.087
But I know that man.

49:17.705 --> 49:19.753
And he is very sexual.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.878
So if he's not getting it from me,
he's getting it from somewhere.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.804
No, Mel, no.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.216
I don't believe that, not for one second.

49:29.216 --> 49:31.093
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

49:31.177 --> 49:33.976
I'm sure. He learned his lesson
before y'all got married.

49:35.055 --> 49:36.056
Okay.

49:37.516 --> 49:41.020
If he's cheating, he better pray to God
that I don't find out.

49:41.103 --> 49:43.401
Yeah, for all our sakes.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.403
- Stop it.
- You a little crazy.

49:45.483 --> 49:47.076
- Hey!
- You know it.

49:50.029 --> 49:51.450
<i>I love my wife.</i>

49:51.530 --> 49:55.251
<i>And I just wanna do so much for her.</i>

49:56.160 --> 49:58.124
<i>She's done so much for me.</i>

49:58.204 --> 50:03.379
<i>And if you can find the time to just
take a look at the Gayle Force Wind,</i>

50:03.459 --> 50:07.007
<i>it will truly, truly change this planet.</i>

50:07.087 --> 50:09.427
<i>The Gayle Force Wind.</i>

50:09.507 --> 50:11.931
<i>The Gayle Force Wind.</i>
<i>The Gayle Force Wind.</i>

50:16.889 --> 50:20.769
Hey, they need this delivery
by 11:00 am this morning.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.398
- It's a big one.
- Okay.

50:22.478 --> 50:24.606
They're having a corporate luncheon
or something like that.

50:24.688 --> 50:28.113
All the execs will be there,
and they need this fish fresh.

50:31.028 --> 50:32.655
And he likes it an hour before they open.

50:32.738 --> 50:33.826
Okay.

50:33.906 --> 50:35.283
It's our biggest client,
so you can't be late.

50:35.366 --> 50:37.037
- Okay.
- Look, man...

50:37.117 --> 50:38.539
you've been killing it around here.

50:38.619 --> 50:40.207
All right. Keep up the good work.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.789
And don't worry about the Moore sisters.

50:41.872 --> 50:43.670
They're just close.

50:44.833 --> 50:45.960
Yeah.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.340
Yeah, I know.

50:58.472 --> 50:59.473
Hey.

50:59.932 --> 51:01.935
So, I see. You just not
gonna say nothing to him?

51:02.017 --> 51:03.314
Not a damn thing.

51:03.394 --> 51:06.239
I just need him to work,
like all of us have to do.

51:10.484 --> 51:14.114
Let me see, 9 times 16.

51:14.863 --> 51:16.285
Let's see here.

51:20.828 --> 51:22.455
Let's see here.

51:22.538 --> 51:23.539
27...

51:24.540 --> 51:25.382
2...

51:26.792 --> 51:27.668
Okay.

51:29.587 --> 51:30.884
What is this?

51:35.551 --> 51:38.600
<i>Hi, Mr. Prescott. My name is Robert Gayle.</i>

51:39.763 --> 51:43.688
<i>I invented this battery, Gayle Force Wind.</i>

51:44.852 --> 51:46.980
<i>I would appreciate it</i>

51:47.062 --> 51:49.065
<i>if you would consider reviewing my materials.</i>

51:49.148 --> 51:50.110
<i>Thank you.</i>

51:50.190 --> 51:51.988
Are you still watching those videos?

51:53.027 --> 51:54.028
Yeah.

51:57.990 --> 51:59.412
Is Prescott in yet?

51:59.950 --> 52:01.168
Let me check.

52:13.797 --> 52:14.639
Yeah.

52:14.882 --> 52:16.509
<i>Hey, man. It's 9:30.</i>

52:16.592 --> 52:18.639
Just wanted to be sure
you're gonna be there at 11:00.

52:18.719 --> 52:19.561
<i>Yeah.</i>

52:20.596 --> 52:23.185
I'm tracking you. It's a lot of traffic.

52:23.265 --> 52:24.983
Yeah. I'm close.

52:25.559 --> 52:26.651
You the man.

52:27.102 --> 52:28.440
<i>I'll call you when it's done.</i>

52:28.520 --> 52:29.362
Okay.

52:39.448 --> 52:42.202
Look, the last letter I sent was
the morning before you called.

52:42.284 --> 52:43.536
You must have just gotten it.

52:43.619 --> 52:45.165
I won't send another.
I won't call your office.

52:45.245 --> 52:47.543
Plus, I threw the battery out,
so no need to threaten me.

52:47.623 --> 52:48.794
<i>Well, that's too bad.</i>

52:48.874 --> 52:51.878
<i>I saw your research. It's brilliant.</i>

52:51.960 --> 52:53.963
<i>I've shown it to Mr. Prescott.</i>

52:54.046 --> 52:55.009
Oh, my God.

52:55.089 --> 52:59.430
<i>He wants to meet with you today at 11:30,
but if you've thrown out the prototype...</i>

52:59.510 --> 53:01.763
No, no, no. I have it, I have it.

53:01.845 --> 53:02.808
<i>Can you make it at 11:30?</i>

53:02.888 --> 53:03.980
11:30.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.684
Does it have to be today?

53:06.767 --> 53:08.895
<i>Robert, you're joking, right?</i>

53:10.729 --> 53:14.194
Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes.
I'll be there. I'll be there.

53:14.274 --> 53:16.072
<i>Okay, I'll see you then.</i>

53:19.238 --> 53:20.114
Oh, shit.

53:42.386 --> 53:43.933
- Kalvin!
- Yo.

53:45.347 --> 53:47.224
Check this out, man.

53:50.185 --> 53:51.607
Where's he going?

53:52.312 --> 53:53.313
Shit.

53:54.106 --> 53:55.824
He's not pickin' up.

53:58.819 --> 53:59.661
Babe.

53:59.987 --> 54:01.075
<i>Hey, Kalvin.</i>

54:01.155 --> 54:02.242
Yeah, you're not gonna believe this.

54:02.322 --> 54:03.619
- <i>What's up?</i>
- Where you at?

54:03.699 --> 54:05.201
- <i>I'm going to Mel's.</i>
- You with Melinda?

54:05.284 --> 54:06.411
<i>No. Not yet. What?</i>

54:06.493 --> 54:07.995
- It looks like he's heading to her house.
- <i>What?</i>

54:08.078 --> 54:09.750
Yeah. Meet us over there, all right?

54:09.830 --> 54:11.168
- <i>All right.</i>
- All right. Love you.

54:11.248 --> 54:12.249
Come on, man.

54:12.875 --> 54:13.717
Come on.

54:16.211 --> 54:17.087
Hey! Hey!

54:47.618 --> 54:48.460
Hey!

54:50.162 --> 54:51.250
Hey, hey, hey!

54:51.330 --> 54:52.501
Sorry, sorry.

54:52.581 --> 54:54.670
I need that, I need that, I need that.

54:54.750 --> 54:55.796
- That?
- Yeah, yeah.

54:55.876 --> 54:56.843
Of course.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.886
- Hey, Mel.
- Mmm-hmm.

55:06.804 --> 55:08.977
Mel, honey, your sisters are here.

55:13.060 --> 55:15.609
This can't be good.

55:16.104 --> 55:19.570
<i>Do you know what the last thing
a woman wants to hear about her man?</i>

55:19.650 --> 55:21.071
<i>It's that he's cheating on her.</i>

55:21.151 --> 55:22.903
Wait up, I'm coming.

55:22.986 --> 55:26.952
<i>And the last person in the world
she wants to hear that shit from</i>

55:27.032 --> 55:29.660
<i>is the damn family member
who told her he would.</i>

55:47.427 --> 55:48.849
Hey, baby, you're not gonna believe this!

55:48.929 --> 55:50.225
The fuck is wrong with you, man?

55:50.305 --> 55:51.852
You're gonna cost us our biggest client!

55:51.932 --> 55:53.309
- Where the keys?
- Let me show you, man.

55:53.392 --> 55:55.105
- Right here.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

55:55.185 --> 55:57.188
- You trying to destroy us?
- Look, I'm sorry!

55:57.271 --> 55:59.399
- Let it go, man.
- I'm sorry, man.

56:05.487 --> 56:07.080
Hey, baby, you're not gonna believe this.

56:07.990 --> 56:10.084
But they called...
They called about the battery.

56:11.952 --> 56:13.579
Prescott called, baby.

56:13.662 --> 56:14.754
What is this?

56:17.791 --> 56:20.590
Why was her wallet in your truck?

56:22.296 --> 56:23.218
What?

56:28.218 --> 56:30.312
After all these years,

56:31.054 --> 56:34.895
you still messin' around with her,
aren't you? Hmm?

56:34.975 --> 56:37.147
- After all we've been through, Robert?
- No. Baby, no.

56:37.227 --> 56:39.195
Baby, no. I promise you. Listen.

56:39.646 --> 56:40.773
I saw her.

56:40.856 --> 56:42.945
It must've fallen out in the truck.

56:43.025 --> 56:46.370
Why was she in your truck, Robert?

56:47.613 --> 56:48.956
Listen, listen.

56:50.282 --> 56:52.034
Listen, I gotta go.

56:52.367 --> 56:55.082
- You gotta go?
- I promise you it isn't... Listen.

56:55.162 --> 56:57.376
I will explain everything
when I get back, okay?

56:57.456 --> 57:00.710
Robert, if you walk out of that door,
there is no coming back.

57:00.792 --> 57:04.547
Prescott called me.
I have to go. I have to go.

57:04.630 --> 57:06.553
So you're just gonna leave?

57:07.966 --> 57:09.809
You're just gonna leave?

57:12.387 --> 57:14.476
Where you goin', huh?

57:14.556 --> 57:16.895
Where you goin'? Where you goin'?

57:16.975 --> 57:18.188
Baby, I need my keys!

57:18.268 --> 57:19.690
You ain't getting a damn thing!

57:19.770 --> 57:20.691
What, you just gonna just leave?

57:20.771 --> 57:22.273
Baby, I gotta go. Give me the keys!

57:22.356 --> 57:24.069
No! Take 'em.

57:24.149 --> 57:25.901
Take 'em. Please, take 'em.

57:25.984 --> 57:27.611
I can call the cops,
I'll have your ass arrested.

57:27.694 --> 57:28.782
- Take 'em!
- Damn it, baby!

57:28.862 --> 57:30.200
You don't understand! I need to see Prescott!

57:30.280 --> 57:31.326
What? Her?

57:31.406 --> 57:33.328
- No!
- After all these years...

57:33.408 --> 57:36.378
Baby, I didn't do anything! Baby...

57:37.037 --> 57:39.290
Baby! Mel!

57:39.915 --> 57:41.667
Get off of me. Get off of me!

57:41.750 --> 57:45.926
- Get your hands off of me!
- Mel, stop!

57:46.880 --> 57:49.133
- Mel, you need to stop!
- No!

57:49.216 --> 57:51.013
- Stop it!
- Melinda!

57:51.093 --> 57:52.686
- Give me the damn keys!
- Melin...

57:54.012 --> 57:56.515
Get off of her! Get off of her!

57:58.392 --> 58:00.269
Get your ass off of my sister!

58:00.978 --> 58:02.441
- No!
- Get off of me so I can...

58:02.521 --> 58:04.524
Get off of me! Don't let him go!

58:04.606 --> 58:07.109
- Come on! Help me!
- Don't let him go!

58:08.193 --> 58:09.364
Don't let him go!

58:09.444 --> 58:11.492
Don't let him go! You're letting him go!

58:12.781 --> 58:14.533
Why are you letting him go?

58:16.201 --> 58:17.414
You better not come back!

58:17.494 --> 58:20.498
- Go!
- Don't let him go!

58:20.580 --> 58:22.674
Help me, June. Get her up here. Go!

58:33.677 --> 58:34.519
Damn it.

59:15.552 --> 59:16.599
Robert.

59:17.262 --> 59:19.101
What a way to make
the wrong first impression.

59:19.181 --> 59:20.978
- You look terrible.
- I'm sorry.

59:21.058 --> 59:24.062
Gonna be hard to convince people
you're not crazy looking like this.

59:24.144 --> 59:25.566
Follow me, come on.

59:37.783 --> 59:39.705
Are you okay?

59:39.785 --> 59:40.786
Robert...

59:40.869 --> 59:42.708
My wife...

59:42.788 --> 59:44.665
You're melting down.

59:45.290 --> 59:47.213
You left this in my truck.

59:47.626 --> 59:49.344
Robert, did you steal my wallet?

59:50.962 --> 59:52.714
You left it in my truck.

59:53.340 --> 59:55.513
No, Robert. Is this what this is about?

59:56.134 --> 59:57.306
Did she find it?

59:58.011 --> 59:59.229
I'm so sorry.

59:59.554 --> 01:00:02.979
I got nothing left. Okay? I got nothing left.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:06.565
Yeah, I risked everything
for this meeting with Prescott, okay?

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:07.983
And I'm not even sure if I can do this.

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:11.236
Look... Look at me, Robert! Look at me.

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:13.319
If this is as good as your research suggests

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.865
then your dreams have come true.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:18.160
Now you need to put the personal shit aside

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.992
and you go in there and you own that room.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:21.959
You got me?

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.248
Come on, let's go.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:28.966
Leave that.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.782
Mr. Prescott, this is Robert Gayle.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.571
The persistent Mr. Gayle.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.615
Like a gale force wind.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.322
All right. Let's hear this pitch.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.374
What happened? Did we make it in time?

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:07.421
No.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:08.999
So we're gonna lose our trucks?

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:14.463
- We can keep the trucks.
- We lost him as a client.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:16.298
He won't give us the money for this house.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.348
It's gonna be okay, baby.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:25.189
Is she okay?

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:28.276
No.

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:30.691
<i>I wasn't.</i>

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:34.032
<i>I was in that place that scares me.</i>

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:37.327
<i>That place between present and furious.</i>

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:39.696
<i>I had lost all rhyme and reason.</i>

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:43.078
<i>It's like nothing mattered but getting even.</i>

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:46.456
<i>I was told I get it from my daddy,
but his was quiet.</i>

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:47.537
<i>Mine...</i>

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:51.044
<i>I would burn a whole house down with me in it</i>

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:53.468
<i>to get to the motherfucker
that done me wrong.</i>

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:57.551
...and the lipo and nickel,
and the Gayle Force Wind...

01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.383
Okay, I've heard enough.

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:02.514
Our team has received your research.

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:05.564
They believe it can work,
even though you don't have a prototype.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:10.687
We wanna offer you &800,000 today

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:14.985
for all your notes and research,
and any plans that you have.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:18.035
You will have to sign
a non-compete, of course.

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:20.695
$800,000. Um...

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:26.205
You wanna buy... Buy my work?

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:27.873
Yes.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:30.709
That's how this goes.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:34.213
We are prepared to write you a check today.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.461
Um...

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:41.636
No offense, Mr. Prescott...

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:43.969
I have no intentions of selling my work.

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:49.728
I wanna own my copyrights
and license it to you for a term.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:54.109
When this thing hits the market,
it will bring billions to your firm.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:03:00.153
I only think it's right for me
to participate in that upside.

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:04.957
Yes. But I would be taking all the risk
and spending all the money to perfect it.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:09.789
$800,000 is my offer to you, Mr. Gayle.

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:11.712
And it's not changing.

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:14.924
Take it or leave it.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.216
Um...

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.012
I'm gonna have to say no.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:33.772
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.855
Sure. Okay.

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:41.702
- Well, thank you.
- Sorry, Mr. Prescott.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.303
Robert. Robert!

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.513
Wait, Robert!

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.060
There's no way I can take that deal.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.143
- It's a lot of money...
- Not for him.

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:16.861
This is my life.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.658
What did I do?

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:25.866
I'm sorry.

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:29.157
Robert, I'm sorry,
especially about the wallet.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.787
Robert. Robert.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.808
Look, first let me just say this.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:54.937
I did not do anything with Diana.

01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:58.020
I found out that she worked at Prescott,

01:04:58.103 --> 01:05:01.281
and we went out for coffee
to talk business, and that was it.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.778
And she got into the truck because her daddy

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.701
was some kind of driver
or something like that.

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:08.700
And her... Her wallet fell out of her purse.

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.158
Look, listen, I know it makes no damn sense,

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.834
but it's the truth.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.380
And the reason why
I didn't make the deliveries

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:24.299
because Prescott called me, baby,

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.595
to see the battery.

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:31.140
They offered me $800,000.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:34.184
And he was ready to write that check today.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:36.938
And I'm sure if I had a prototype,
it would have been a lot more.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.022
$800,000 today?

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:43.940
- Yeah.
- You need to take the money.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.278
Look, I can't.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.486
There is no damn money. He lying.

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:50.363
Baby...

01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:56.081
- Can we talk by ourselves?
- Sure.

01:05:56.161 --> 01:05:57.288
Sure.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.882
Just let me understand this.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:07.506
Some random bitch
that I caught you with before

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:10.642
just happens to be in your truck

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:13.303
and leaves her wallet?

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:18.354
This house is getting foreclosed on.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:24.531
And you turned down an $800,000 check

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:26.319
that Mr. Prescott

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.486
was gonna write you today?

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.326
Is this the bullshit you selling me?

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.577
Baby, this is not bullshit.

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:35.995
Then call him and take the offer.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:37.122
It's not a good offer.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.708
- It's not a good offer, baby.
- "It's not a good offer."

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:43.007
So I just lose my mother's house?

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.421
Baby, I'll buy you a bigger house.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.097
As a matter of fact,

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:54.678
we're gonna live in a high-rise building
overlooking the city.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:56.764
And that diamond...

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.020
I'm gonna get you.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:04.321
And the <i>Mrs. Gayle,</i> private jet.

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:07.068
We're gonna make it, baby.

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.194
This is it.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:09.696
No, we're not.

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.579
No, we're not gonna make it.

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:16.908
You had a good woman.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.169
I would do anything for you.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:25.466
And I did.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:28.969
And you lie

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.637
and you cheat on me.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:41.141
You're a motherfucking loser.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:45.737
Don't talk to me like that, baby, please.

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:50.238
I'm done with you. I'm done.

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:54.905
I need you to get your shit while you can,
and I need you to get out.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.248
I want a divorce.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:07:59.246
Mel...

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:02.790
Mel, please.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.747
- No.
- Mel, I love you.

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:05.707
Please.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:07.712
You're really gonna do this?

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:10.921
Why don't you go find that bitch
and let her take you in?

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:12.256
- Get out.
- Mel.

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:15.262
Get out!

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:20.430
Come on, man. You should leave.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:21.856
I'm not leaving.

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.319
You know me.

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:35.120
You know I can be the motherfucking devil.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:31.337
<i>Three months later, I lost my mama's house.</i>

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:34.091
<i>You know, that bastard didn't
even call to see if I was okay.</i>

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:37.303
<i>He didn't even bother.</i>

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.100
<i>He was done with me.</i>

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:43.179
<i>He had gotten all he could.</i>

01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:47.066
<i>I guess he was off looking
for his next victim.</i>

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.897
<i>Not caring that I was devastated.</i>

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:53.026
<i>I can't believe I let that son of a bitch...</i>

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:55.359
<i>Damn.</i>

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:14.044
<i>I was humiliated.</i>

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:16.345
<i>I had to move in with my sister.</i>

01:10:19.257 --> 01:10:22.597
<i>At this age, living with my sister?</i>

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:25.431
<i>All I needed was a bunch of damn cats.</i>

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:26.480
<i>Fuck him!</i>

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.471
Who the hell took my damn phone?

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:04.305
<i>I had wasted too many years with Robert.</i>

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:07.389
<i>Too many years feeling lonely
whenever he was around.</i>

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:10.934
<i>Thought it was time for me to move on,
and so did Brenda.</i>

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:15.026
<i>So she wasted no time trying to
get me hooked up with Devon.</i>

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.733
<i>She heard that he was divorced.</i>

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:22.696
<i>So, much to my disapproval,
she called him up and we went out.</i>

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:27.993
<i>My divorce wasn't even final,
but what the hell?</i>

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:32.880
<i>So there I was, out with a man.</i>

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:35.211
<i>A man that could pay the check</i>

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.919
<i>and who commanded attention
when he walked into the room.</i>

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:39.299
<i>All eyes on him.</i>

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:42.469
<i>And yet, it felt strange.</i>

01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:45.176
<i>It felt foreign. It felt wrong.</i>

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:47.387
<i>It... It was like I was starting over</i>

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:50.690
<i>and learning how things
were really supposed to be.</i>

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.645
<i>And I thought about Robert from time to time.</i>

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:57.400
<i>Sometimes with sympathy
but mostly with anger.</i>

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.029
<i>Especially when I looked up and saw his ass.</i>

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:04.117
<i>There he was in the damn kitchen,
washing dishes.</i>

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:09.201
<i>All that money I wasted helping him,
and his ass is in the damn kitchen?</i>

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:10.626
<i>Of all restaurants!</i>

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:13.003
<i>I got mad all over again.</i>

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:19.712
<i>I wanted my $1,234,908.07</i>

01:12:19.794 --> 01:12:22.673
<i>And that's with him
paying me back every dime,</i>

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:25.429
<i>and then half of all
the bills for all those years.</i>

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:29.683
<i>Looks like his ass will be washing
a lot of dishes to pay me back.</i>

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:32.056
<i>Fuck it, I'll cut my losses.</i>

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:33.436
<i>Just give me a divorce.</i>

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:42.863
Sorry I'm late.

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:49.702
It's a family divorce, I see.

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:52.167
She wanted us here.

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.711
Is your lawyer here, Mr. Gayle?

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:58.085
I can't afford a lawyer.

01:12:58.165 --> 01:13:00.634
No, you can't, working as a dishwasher.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:03.883
Ma'am, you're a guest in this mediation.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:04.964
Please.

01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:08.677
Mel, are you sure you wanna do this?

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:12.180
I still love you so much.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:13.397
I do.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:17.611
We're prepared to let you
have the car and your clothes.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.316
No, no. You keep it.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:22.649
Keep it all. Everything.
I don't want anything.

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:26.034
I just wanna say this and I'm done...

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:31.787
Mel, I am so sorry that
I couldn't be what you needed.

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:33.872
But I...

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:39.337
I never cheated on you again,
after I saw what it did to you.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:44.253
I found out what love is

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:46.590
for the first time in my life because of you.

01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:52.388
I can honestly say with all my heart
that I love you.

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:56.145
I will always love you, Mel.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:03.322
I'm sorry.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:08.778
I'm sorry, Mel.

01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:14.834
Please, Mel, just...

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:16.961
Just look at me.

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:55.408
Well...

01:14:56.742 --> 01:15:00.372
At least you don't have to
give that bastard another thing.

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:17.729
Hello?

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.188
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:24.065
Where the hell have you been?

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:26.108
<i>Someone stole my phone. Sorry.</i>

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:27.652
<i>I've been trying to reach you all week.</i>

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:28.699
I'm sorry.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.527
<i>So Victor called.</i>

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:32.987
<i>He said that you called him
to represent you in the deal.</i>

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:35.618
If there's ever a deal.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.992
Prescott will come back, okay?
You'll see.

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.373
<i>Just keep your fingers crossed.</i>

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:42.917
<i>Hey, I asked Victor for your home address
or your phone number,</i>

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:45.500
and he said he had
to wait for you to call him.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.586
<i>What's going on, Robert?</i>

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:50.257
I'm just... I'm just...

01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:53.056
We're just between places right now.

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:55.722
Robert, did she put you out?

01:15:58.262 --> 01:15:59.639
Um...

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:03.229
We're... We're divorced now.

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:05.398
<i>I've been staying in the Genesis Shelter</i>

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:09.568
<i>on 4th for the past three months,</i>
<i>and I'm just</i>...

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:10.820
I'm coming to get you.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.867
<i>No, Diana.</i>

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:20.994
You okay, baby?

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.169
She is fine.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.126
More champagne?

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:27.967
She's celebrating her divorce.

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:32.380
But my favorite part

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:36.134
is when that bastard said
how much he loved her.

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:38.769
I almost threw up.

01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:43.225
You know, I never thought
he was lying to you, Mel.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:44.854
I always believed he loved you.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.857
You would, but she didn't.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.316
<i>I did believe him.</i>

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:51.239
<i>I even felt sorry for him.</i>

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:53.821
<i>What is that about us as women?</i>

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:56.825
<i>Why do we feel bad
when we didn't do shit, huh?</i>

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.699
<i>And yet, there I was feeling bad about him,</i>

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:01.954
<i>feeling sad that he never made it.</i>

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:03.456
<i>That he was a dishwasher.</i>

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:05.375
<i>Why the hell should I care?</i>

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:07.794
<i>So you know what I did?</i>

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:11.545
<i>I got that tall, sexy thing
standing over there</i>

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.299
<i>to take my mind off it.</i>

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.925
Can we go back to your place?

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:16.382
- Now?
- Yeah.

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:17.845
So sorry.

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:20.019
- Good night, folks. I'm outta here.
- Go on, Devon. It was nice to see you.

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.059
- Get home safe.
- Brenda.

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:24.474
Babe, wait up.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:31.985
This will do you good.

01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:35.283
Thanks.

01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:37.703
Sure.

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:42.120
You should have told me
you were in a shelter.

01:17:45.452 --> 01:17:46.999
It doesn't matter.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.709
Robert, I know you're upset
that you lost your wife,

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:54.170
but listen to me.

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.136
It's okay.

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:03.395
Sometimes things just happen, you know?

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.610
I'm a firm believer that when

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:12.229
someone falls out of your life maybe...

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:14.990
Maybe they're supposed to.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:19.196
Maybe they're not supposed to share
the level that you're going to.

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:24.333
Maybe you're supposed to leave them behind.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:30.957
I hate seeing you this broken, this defeated.

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.216
You're a good man, Robert. You are.

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:40.349
And you're gonna be okay.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.012
I know that you'll be okay.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:53.271
<i>Devon was just okay in bed,
but he wasn't Robert.</i>

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:56.026
<i>Robert mastered my body.</i>

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:57.069
<i>He knew my curves.</i>

01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:59.743
<i>He knew how I liked it slightly to the left.</i>

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.788
<i>Robert would at least try to hold me.</i>

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.327
<i>And the thought of him
being with another woman</i>

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:06.996
<i>still made me jealous.</i>

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:08.164
Good night.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:09.665
<i>You know what I found out?</i>

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:12.585
<i>The truth always comes when a man comes.</i>

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:14.461
<i>When Devon was finished, he was done.</i>

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:15.542
Good night.

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:16.964
<i>Didn't matter what I felt.</i>

01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:18.762
You gotta take me home.

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:22.091
You wore me out. Don't you wanna stay?

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.721
No! Take me home.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:45.368
Still asleep?

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:48.954
Shit. Damn it.

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:50.581
I can't believe I slept this long.

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:53.247
I gotta get to the restaurant.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:54.957
I called them and told them you quit.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.378
What? What?

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:59.506
No, Diana, you have no idea how hard it is
for me to get a damn job.

01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:01.554
Why would you do that?

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:07.137
What's this?

01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:21.696
Is this real?

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:24.369
Yeah.

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.709
This is... This is the offer?

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:38.633
Yeah.

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:41.880
I begged Victor to let me tell you.

01:20:42.713 --> 01:20:45.592
I'm pretty sure this is
Prescott's best and final.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:48.681
And this the best part, Robert,

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:51.058
that this is a license for the technology.

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:52.811
You still own the LP.

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:56.443
You did it.

01:20:58.228 --> 01:20:59.320
You did it.

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:18.669
- Mel.
- What?

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:20.046
Melinda!

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:21.802
- What?
- Look.

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:27.967
What the hell?

01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:30.894
- No way.
- Go.

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:55.789
How are you?

01:21:55.869 --> 01:21:56.791
I'm busy.

01:21:58.038 --> 01:21:59.881
I just need 10 minutes of your time.

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:01.759
You have two.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.802
Okay.

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:07.803
I just wanted to come here to tell you
thank you for loving me.

01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:11.807
You know, there were times
when I doubted myself...

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:14.847
You kept working and kept me believing.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.645
Um... We are never getting back together.

01:22:18.725 --> 01:22:19.688
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.236
- Never.
- I know.

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:24.569
So what is this?

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:28.655
You borrow a suit,
and you come up here and try to...

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:30.908
...impress me?

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:32.285
For what?

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:34.875
My battery. It...

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:37.127
It hit.

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:40.046
Yeah. I signed a deal.

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:42.508
And I'm in business with Prescott.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.053
Good for you.

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:55.062
Good for us.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:01.980
I know our divorce is finalized,
but I wanted you to have this

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.188
for everything you've done for me
over the years.

01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:07.611
I don't know of any woman
who would have put up with me,

01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:10.194
loved me, cared for me...

01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:13.076
Believed in me.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.449
I don't blame you.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:18.627
Like I said, I started to doubt myself.

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:22.457
I'm just sorry that my dream
took so long to come true.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:25.462
Anyway, look.

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:28.341
You gave me two minutes,
I'm sure it's just about up.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:30.843
I love you, Mel.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.013
I always will.

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:41.066
Oh. I almost forgot.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.312
Your mama's house.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.818
It's yours again.

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:50.026
Might look a little different on the inside

01:23:50.108 --> 01:23:52.361
'cause of the last owners, but...

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:53.696
It's yours.

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:33.235
- You're taking all day, baby.
- My partner got it.

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:34.319
It's mine.

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:36.241
- Bam!
- Boo.

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:37.534
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I got you on this one.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:38.741
All right. Let's go, let's go.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:40.621
- Hey, sissy.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:42.453
- Hey, Melinda.
- Where you been?

01:24:44.288 --> 01:24:45.289
You're late, babe.

01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:47.875
- What's up, Mel?
- Yeah, I know.

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:51.754
- Did Robert give you this?
- Yeah.

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:53.635
Along with these keys

01:24:54.214 --> 01:24:56.053
and the deed to Mama's house.

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:57.055
What?

01:24:58.093 --> 01:24:59.765
Yeah, his battery hit.

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:02.064
He's in business with Prescott.

01:25:04.224 --> 01:25:05.896
I'm calling the bank
first thing in the morning.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:08.730
I already did, and it's good.

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:10.652
Damn.

01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:12.904
He hit like this?

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.325
I knew he would. That dude is smart.

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:18.159
Mel, when did you see him?

01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:21.286
He came to my job to tell me he was sorry,

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:25.041
and that he loved me,
and he wanted to give me that.

01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:26.997
Oh, my God.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:30.418
That is so sweet.
We ain't never had this kind of money.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.342
Wow.

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:34.175
He really did it.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:36.180
Well...

01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:38.976
you always thought he would.

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.436
$10 million.

01:25:41.845 --> 01:25:43.597
Hell, go cash this before
he changes his mind or something...

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.057
He won't.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.562
Well, let's not take no chances.

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:47.729
Let's go to the bank
first thing in the morning.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:48.981
That bastard
might have a change of heart or...

01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:51.359
Shut the fuck up.

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:54.858
Why did I listen to you?

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:59.113
I mean, both of you are
some miserable bitches.

01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:01.073
Neither one of you are happy
with these bastards,

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:02.995
and I listened to you.

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:05.499
- Now you just wait one minute.
- No, no.

01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:11.336
Everybody in this town knows Kalvin
has a baby in Ellenwood.

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:15.046
And, well, Casey, you know
what they say about you.

01:26:15.128 --> 01:26:16.216
Melinda!

01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:19.675
Devon, you should go home
and never call me again.

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:22.720
You are horrible in bed.

01:26:22.803 --> 01:26:24.100
You snore,

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:27.308
and you are too big
to have such a little dick.

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:31.979
Fucking shit.

01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:47.085
Hold on.

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:57.303
Hi.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.178
The address was on the check.

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:02.767
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:05.971
And I remembered the building.

01:27:13.603 --> 01:27:16.857
This is the building
you said we would live in.

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:22.367
You look great.

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:25.081
Thank you.

01:27:26.867 --> 01:27:28.414
And this view...

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:31.751
Oh!

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:34.003
This view!

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:39.383
Top floor.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:42.223
You said the top floor.

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:45.010
Out of your dreams.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:48.347
This is just like everything
you described to me.

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:51.479
I'm so proud of you.

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:54.481
Thank you.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:56.404
And when you said you loved me,

01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:02.202
I realized I still love you very, very much.

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:07.285
And I should have believed you

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:09.493
when you said you weren't with her.

01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:12.546
But my sisters, my sisters.
They got in my head.

01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:15.168
That's all behind us now, Mel.

01:28:15.248 --> 01:28:17.546
I'm so glad you said that.

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:22.513
Sorry I'm late, babe.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:31.481
Hey...

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:35.315
Baby, this is Melinda, my ex-wife.

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:39.152
Hi.

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:42.993
I'm Diana. I'm Robert's fiancée.

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:45.783
<i>There she was.</i>

01:28:46.696 --> 01:28:49.745
<i>The bitch I tried to kill all those years ago</i>

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:52.954
<i>standing in my apartment,</i>

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:55.255
<i>wearing my ring.</i>

01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:57.503
<i>Looking at me.</i>

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:16.645
<i>That son of a bitch humiliated me again
in front of that same whore.</i>

01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:20.442
<i>I can't believe he let me pour my heart out
and she was in there all that time.</i>

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:23.820
<i>This bitch was living my life.</i>

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.528
<i>The one I bought and paid for.</i>

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:29.284
<i>He would always like to do it in the shower</i>

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:33.119
<i>because he said it reminded him of us
when we met in the rain.</i>

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.499
<i>You see why I hate the rain?</i>

01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:39.129
<i>I'm sure he was with that bitch
in the shower.</i>

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:42.711
<i>That was supposed to be mine.</i>

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:44.838
<i>Tasting her.</i>

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.801
<i>Fucking her.</i>

01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:56.229
<i>Using what I taught him.</i>

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:59.686
<i>Using my tricks on that trick.</i>

01:30:02.188 --> 01:30:05.442
<i>And I know Nina was somewhere close.</i>

01:30:11.615 --> 01:30:13.913
<i>By now, Robert was spooning her, I'm sure.</i>

01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:17.457
<i>Breathing ever so slightly
on the back of her neck.</i>

01:30:17.537 --> 01:30:21.002
<i>I can still smell the slightest hint
of whiskey on his breath.</i>

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:23.050
<i>I can feel it on my neck.</i>

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:24.635
<i>Bitch!</i>

01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:27.093
<i>And she just moved in?</i>

01:30:27.464 --> 01:30:29.592
<i>Oh, no. I don't think so.</i>

01:30:29.966 --> 01:30:32.013
<i>I put every jewel in that crown,</i>

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:35.142
<i>and I was not about to let
another bitch wear it!</i>

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.862
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:49.906
<i>He could just leave and walk away.</i>

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:51.113
<i>He said he loved me,</i>

01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:54.786
<i>but he moved her into my place
like I never existed.</i>

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:57.539
<i>I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep.</i>

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:01.340
<i>All I did was think about him and her.</i>

01:31:01.748 --> 01:31:03.375
<i>I had alerts on everything I owned.</i>

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:06.303
<i>Every time that bitch posted something,
I knew it.</i>

01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:11.303
<i>And you know what?
Everything he said to me...</i>

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:14.728
<i>He would take me to Paris,
and there they were in Paris.</i>

01:31:15.345 --> 01:31:18.599
<i>He said he would take me on our private jet.</i>

01:31:18.682 --> 01:31:20.525
<i>And there they were.</i>

01:31:21.851 --> 01:31:24.605
<i>Day and night, I just watched her page.</i>

01:31:24.688 --> 01:31:26.526
<i>I couldn't help it.</i>

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:28.859
<i>Her wedding ideas. And her.</i>

01:31:28.942 --> 01:31:31.281
<i>She even chose a dress by the same designer</i>

01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:32.908
<i>that I wanted to make mine.</i>

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:34.659
<i>At the same boutique.</i>

01:31:34.739 --> 01:31:36.286
- <i>I got you.</i>
- <i>Babe...</i>

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:38.619
- <i>I will not let go of you.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:40.955
<i>Walking. So get ready...</i>

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:42.710
<i>Okay.</i>

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:44.674
<i>Not yet.</i>

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:47.795
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>No, just... Right there.</i>

01:31:47.877 --> 01:31:49.174
<i>All right.</i>

01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:51.218
<i>Can I open?</i>

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:52.724
<i>Open them now.</i>

01:31:54.718 --> 01:31:56.389
<i>Look behind you.</i>

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:57.557
<i>Surprise.</i>

01:31:57.637 --> 01:31:59.605
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:03.730
<i>The</i> Mrs. Gayle.

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:06.654
<i>I told you I would buy it for you.</i>

01:32:26.916 --> 01:32:29.005
- I love this, I love this!
- Mmm.

01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:30.928
Oh, my God. I like this, but in white.

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:32.380
- Hmm.
- Yeah?

01:32:32.464 --> 01:32:33.677
How about this one?

01:32:33.757 --> 01:32:35.303
As you're waving goodbye to your guests.

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.847
Perfect! I love it. They're gonna love it!

01:32:37.927 --> 01:32:38.849
Hi, John.

01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:42.143
Hey, babe. Look at this.

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:45.647
Okay, what do you think about this with
the "bon voyage" and I wave goodbye?

01:32:45.727 --> 01:32:47.104
- It's beautiful.
- Right? Ain't it pretty?

01:32:47.187 --> 01:32:48.188
Listen, baby, can I talk to you?

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:49.398
Yeah, sure.

01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:53.363
Okay, well, John, we'll talk more
about the wedding tomorrow?

01:32:53.443 --> 01:32:54.570
Some other time? Okay.

01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:55.824
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks, John.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.241
What's...

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:02.790
Melinda, she's...

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:04.579
She's suing us.

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:07.882
She's claiming that the deal
happened before the divorce.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:10.343
We both know that's not true.

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:13.179
Yeah, I know. It's just so sad.

01:33:14.464 --> 01:33:16.091
Yeah, I'm gonna call Franklin.

01:33:16.841 --> 01:33:19.469
Yeah, I already talked to him
this morning about her.

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:21.262
What? Why?

01:33:21.888 --> 01:33:24.016
I didn't wanna tell you,
but I received, like,

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:27.147
3,300 nasty comments from
somebody named Pissed.

01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:28.854
And, of course, it's Melinda.

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:29.938
I'll talk to her.

01:33:30.021 --> 01:33:32.149
- No.
- Maybe I can give her more money.

01:33:32.232 --> 01:33:34.781
No. It's not about the money.

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:38.405
You cannot negotiate with crazy.

01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:41.162
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah.

01:33:47.163 --> 01:33:48.005
Mel?

01:33:49.415 --> 01:33:50.837
- Mel?
- Hey, Sarah!

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:52.044
Hey. Hey.

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:53.629
Look, she's not calling us.

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:55.508
- I don't think we should be here.
- Something's wrong.

01:33:55.588 --> 01:33:59.183
Guys, I don't think it's a good idea
for us to go in there. Come on!

01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:02.478
Where are you going? What is...

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:07.103
It is still that easy to get in here?

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:08.059
Melinda?

01:34:08.977 --> 01:34:10.945
- Melinda?
- Melinda?

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:14.277
Melinda, where are you?

01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:15.700
Mel?

01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:20.158
What is going...

01:34:20.238 --> 01:34:22.161
- What the hell is all this?
- What?

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.167
Oh, my God.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.708
Oh, my God. What is...

01:34:28.788 --> 01:34:31.542
We're certain he made the deal
with Prescott & Howard Industries

01:34:31.624 --> 01:34:33.797
while he was still married
to my client, Your Honor.

01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:36.132
He also received all the investments

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:39.302
for the Gayle Force battery
from my client's income alone,

01:34:39.382 --> 01:34:42.180
and the mortgage from the family house,
which she lost.

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.683
Counselor, I'm looking at all
the dates on these contracts,

01:34:45.763 --> 01:34:47.310
and the email chains,

01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:50.105
and an affidavit from
Prescott & Howard Industries.

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:52.313
They attest that the deal wasn't offered

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:55.570
until well after Mr. Gayle
and your client were divorced.

01:34:57.734 --> 01:35:00.698
And seeing as he didn't ask
for the divorce, she did,

01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:01.905
I'm confused.

01:35:02.572 --> 01:35:04.495
- Well, Your Honor...
- I'm not done.

01:35:05.408 --> 01:35:10.164
After the divorce, he gave your client
$10 million voluntarily.

01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:12.585
And then he rebought the family house

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:14.337
and gave that to her.

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:15.714
Is that right?

01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:17.128
Yes, Your Honor.

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:19.884
And how much are you claiming for damages?

01:35:19.964 --> 01:35:22.428
Well, she invested over $1.2 million

01:35:22.508 --> 01:35:23.885
over the course of their marriage.

01:35:23.968 --> 01:35:26.972
And we're asking for half the value
of the Gayle Force battery,

01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:30.685
which deems to exceed
approximately $150 million.

01:35:30.767 --> 01:35:33.270
Okay, enough. That's ridiculous.

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:38.488
It is apparent to the court that Mr. Gayle
has been more than fair.

01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:40.655
I'm going to dismiss this case.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:42.487
This is not fair.

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:45.574
I should get half of what he got.
That is fair.

01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:47.370
Listen. This court has spoken.

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:51.624
Don't you understand that
he didn't have to give you anything?

01:35:51.704 --> 01:35:55.044
This is one of the most generous gestures
this court has ever seen.

01:35:55.124 --> 01:35:57.377
This case is dismissed.

01:35:58.336 --> 01:36:01.384
Also, Your Honor,
there's another matter on the docket.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:04.092
Mrs. Moore has been harassing
the future Mrs. Gayle.

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:07.891
You'll see all the evidence
presented there in front of you.

01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:11.350
We're asking for a restraining order
for both Mr. and Mrs. Gayle.

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:13.104
I'm the one who should get
the damn restraining order.

01:36:13.184 --> 01:36:15.732
- Counselor, control your client!
- Melinda.

01:36:15.812 --> 01:36:18.406
I don't need to be controlled.
I'm not an animal.

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:21.488
Did you send these messages?

01:36:22.568 --> 01:36:23.911
This is America.

01:36:24.737 --> 01:36:26.614
I have freedom of speech.

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:27.785
These are threats.

01:36:27.865 --> 01:36:30.163
You could spend time in jail, Mrs. Moore.

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.582
Do it again, and you will.

01:36:32.662 --> 01:36:34.335
The restraining order is granted.

01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:36.875
Mrs. Moore,

01:36:37.542 --> 01:36:41.090
you are to stay 300 yards away
from Mr. and Mrs. Gayle.

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:43.673
- Do you understand?
- They're not married.

01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:46.134
Stay away from both of them.

01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:47.764
Is that clear enough for you?

01:36:48.303 --> 01:36:49.395
Yes.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:57.899
Wait, go!

01:36:58.313 --> 01:36:59.400
Melinda!

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.777
- Go!
- Mel, don't!

01:37:00.857 --> 01:37:02.860
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Stop, stop, stop.

01:37:02.942 --> 01:37:04.034
Let them go.

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:06.738
- Melinda, no.
- Melinda!

01:37:06.821 --> 01:37:11.167
This is Melinda,
and I am live recording on the Internet.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:14.207
<i>I want you to see this injustice.</i>

01:37:14.287 --> 01:37:17.961
This whore slept with my husband.

01:37:18.041 --> 01:37:20.044
<i>And he left me with nothing...</i>

01:37:20.126 --> 01:37:21.839
- Stop it now. Please stop.
- Enough, enough!

01:37:21.919 --> 01:37:23.007
Please stop!

01:37:23.087 --> 01:37:24.676
Mel, it's not healthy. I'm serious.

01:37:24.756 --> 01:37:26.804
You have to stop the way
you're dealing with him.

01:37:27.216 --> 01:37:28.888
I don't want to talk about him.

01:37:28.968 --> 01:37:30.556
Fine, we won't.
We'll talk about your sisters,

01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:32.558
and how they love you,
and they're worried about you.

01:37:32.638 --> 01:37:33.765
And so am I.

01:37:33.848 --> 01:37:35.350
That stuff that we found in your house.

01:37:35.433 --> 01:37:36.605
- It was...
- Wait.

01:37:38.019 --> 01:37:39.566
You went to my house?

01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:41.693
Yeah.

01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:43.319
Y'all motherfuckers don't wanna help me.

01:37:43.399 --> 01:37:44.776
Come with me, so we can talk about it.

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:46.531
- Melinda, just...
- No, I see what's going on.

01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:48.614
- Melinda?
- Fuck that!

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:50.289
I'm going to June's.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:58.957
Thank you, guys, for coming.

01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:02.465
Look, we're worried about Melinda.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.883
She has really lost it over you two.

01:38:05.338 --> 01:38:08.137
Now, we're gonna try to get a judge
to force her and get some help.

01:38:08.508 --> 01:38:09.554
That might be a good idea.

01:38:09.634 --> 01:38:12.137
But in the meantime, you need to be careful.

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:13.221
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:38:13.304 --> 01:38:14.351
Both of you do.

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:17.937
We have the restraining order.

01:38:18.017 --> 01:38:20.020
You guys might wanna have
security at the wedding.

01:38:20.103 --> 01:38:21.855
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

01:38:21.938 --> 01:38:23.190
Look, guys,

01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:24.569
I know she's upset.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:27.068
Like you said, I know your sister.

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:28.903
She'll be fine once she calms down.

01:38:28.986 --> 01:38:32.081
If you think that, you don't know her at all.

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:35.788
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

01:38:35.868 --> 01:38:37.540
You two, you cannot be here right now.

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:39.463
- She's right behind me.
- Oh, shit.

01:38:39.956 --> 01:38:42.670
Why the fuck are y'all
still coming in my house

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.502
- without my permission?
- Sweetie.

01:38:45.086 --> 01:38:46.299
So what y'all been doing?

01:38:46.379 --> 01:38:49.093
- Talking about me behind my back?
- Melinda.

01:38:49.173 --> 01:38:50.511
- Go!
- That's why you brought her here?

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:51.554
No! No!

01:38:51.634 --> 01:38:53.352
- Let me talk to her!
- No!

01:38:54.178 --> 01:38:56.225
Y'all have to hold me back! No!

01:38:56.305 --> 01:38:58.770
I need that bitch to know that's my car!

01:38:58.850 --> 01:39:00.727
Why would you bring her here, Robert?

01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:02.732
That's my car, bitch!

01:39:02.812 --> 01:39:03.939
It's not worth it, honey.

01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:06.024
- That's my car!
- No! No!

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:08.280
- Go!
- Get off of me!

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:10.995
- I'm okay. Okay!
- All right!

01:39:13.656 --> 01:39:14.623
I'm okay.

01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:16.993
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:39:18.453 --> 01:39:20.124
Stop treating me like this.

01:39:20.204 --> 01:39:22.298
Why would you let him bring her here?

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:25.877
So disrespectful!
What kind of family are you, huh?

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.087
What about me?

01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:29.839
- God!
- Melinda!

01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.512
Melinda!

01:40:02.872 --> 01:40:04.544
Hi, may I help you?

01:40:04.624 --> 01:40:06.342
No, I'm just looking.

01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:07.718
Thank you.

01:40:11.547 --> 01:40:13.424
Here we go.

01:40:14.217 --> 01:40:15.263
It's really lovely.

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:17.266
Yeah, I love the buttons.

01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:07.523
Hey, wait!

01:41:07.603 --> 01:41:10.197
And she ruined the future
Mrs. Gayle's wedding dress.

01:41:10.648 --> 01:41:12.400
This court apologizes to you.

01:41:12.483 --> 01:41:14.110
I shouldn't have been so lenient.

01:41:14.193 --> 01:41:15.445
It's okay, Your Honor.

01:41:15.528 --> 01:41:17.030
I couldn't fit the dress anymore anyway.

01:41:17.572 --> 01:41:19.666
This little one's growing pretty fast.

01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:26.214
What is it going to take to make you
heed the warnings of this court?

01:41:26.789 --> 01:41:30.089
It's obvious to me that you're not
taking this matter seriously.

01:41:31.043 --> 01:41:34.388
I will not allow you to continue
to harass these people.

01:41:35.131 --> 01:41:36.178
Am I clear?

01:41:36.841 --> 01:41:39.430
If you violate this restraining order,

01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:42.855
I assure you, you will spend 40 days
in the county jail.

01:41:43.264 --> 01:41:44.265
I mean it.

01:41:44.348 --> 01:41:45.975
One more offense.

01:41:46.058 --> 01:41:48.607
Do I make myself clear?

01:41:54.191 --> 01:41:55.568
Yes, Your Honor.

01:41:56.819 --> 01:41:58.116
<i>Melinda.</i>

01:41:59.155 --> 01:42:02.580
Have you ever considered that maybe
there's another way to look at this?

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:05.290
Maybe he did mean what he said.

01:42:06.662 --> 01:42:09.666
Maybe the deceit isn't what you think.

01:42:10.166 --> 01:42:12.794
Would you allow room for that possibility?

01:42:13.502 --> 01:42:16.342
Would you feel better
if he was really being honest

01:42:16.422 --> 01:42:19.426
and he really meant well?

01:42:22.178 --> 01:42:24.806
I am not wrong.

01:42:26.599 --> 01:42:28.852
You're just like everybody else.

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.357
See...

01:42:33.022 --> 01:42:34.240
I get dogged...

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:36.609
and it's my fault.

01:42:37.443 --> 01:42:38.781
That's not what I'm saying.

01:42:38.861 --> 01:42:39.988
That's what you're saying.

01:42:40.071 --> 01:42:43.575
I just wanted to know
if you would consider it.

01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:45.204
Let me ask you another question.

01:42:45.284 --> 01:42:46.411
Okay.

01:42:47.912 --> 01:42:52.543
Have you ever heard of something called
Borderline Personality Disorder?

01:42:52.625 --> 01:42:54.753
It's when a person has...

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:56.178
You know what?

01:42:57.296 --> 01:42:58.798
I'm not doing this.

01:42:59.507 --> 01:43:02.056
Fuck you and this bullshit.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.057
I'm not crazy.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.687
What?

01:43:07.098 --> 01:43:09.772
Get out of here with this bullshit.

01:43:10.351 --> 01:43:13.776
As a matter of fact, I'm out.

01:43:14.355 --> 01:43:16.358
We are gathered here...

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:19.489
<i>That bitch wasted
no time taking over my life.</i>

01:43:19.902 --> 01:43:22.997
<i>I just can't believe
Robert married that whore...</i>

01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:26.747
<i>and gave her my boat. My boat!</i>

01:43:27.576 --> 01:43:29.374
<i>The boat with my name on it.</i>

01:43:30.121 --> 01:43:31.873
<i>She was living my life.</i>

01:43:34.834 --> 01:43:35.881
<i>Fuck her.</i>

01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:37.796
<i>Fuck him.</i>

01:43:38.754 --> 01:43:40.381
<i>Fuck them both.</i>

01:43:44.802 --> 01:43:45.849
Hey.

01:44:19.003 --> 01:44:20.550
Melinda?

01:44:21.797 --> 01:44:22.673
Melinda?

01:44:41.317 --> 01:44:43.365
It's a beautiful night.

01:44:44.028 --> 01:44:45.029
Mmm-hmm.

01:44:45.613 --> 01:44:46.489
Mmm-hmm.

01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:48.328
I love you.

01:44:51.035 --> 01:44:52.628
Look at those stars.

01:44:55.247 --> 01:44:57.294
You're that one. What are you doing?

01:44:57.374 --> 01:44:59.126
I meant to start a bath.

01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:00.506
Let the staff do it.

01:45:00.586 --> 01:45:03.340
No, no. I need to get up.
I need to get sea legs.

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:07.468
You wanna join me in a few?

01:45:08.219 --> 01:45:09.516
You know it.

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:14.608
See you.

01:45:53.347 --> 01:45:54.685
Where's my wedding dress?

01:45:54.765 --> 01:45:56.562
It was hanging in the closet, ma'am.

01:45:56.642 --> 01:45:57.643
I didn't see it.

01:45:57.726 --> 01:45:59.190
I'll check with housekeeping.

01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:00.271
Okay.

01:46:23.335 --> 01:46:24.587
The bath is ready already?

01:46:24.670 --> 01:46:26.013
No.

01:46:26.755 --> 01:46:27.677
Sit down.

01:46:28.173 --> 01:46:29.220
Mel.

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:31.435
What are you doing?

01:46:31.844 --> 01:46:33.596
What are you doing?

01:46:34.722 --> 01:46:36.190
What are you doing, Robert?

01:46:36.765 --> 01:46:39.143
- Come on, Mel, you know this is not right.
- No.

01:46:39.226 --> 01:46:42.196
What's not right is what you did to me.

01:46:42.897 --> 01:46:44.068
What did I do?

01:46:44.148 --> 01:46:45.945
Don't act like you don't remember.

01:46:46.025 --> 01:46:48.073
Okay, okay, okay.

01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:51.367
Tell me so that I'm sure.

01:46:51.447 --> 01:46:52.539
You left me.

01:46:53.532 --> 01:46:56.035
You took the best parts of my life.

01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:58.413
And you gave that bitch my ring,

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:00.623
my apartment,

01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:02.712
my boat,

01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:04.256
my life.

01:47:05.169 --> 01:47:08.467
And you promised those things to me.
Didn't you, Robert?

01:47:08.547 --> 01:47:09.635
Didn't you?

01:47:09.715 --> 01:47:11.011
I did, I did.

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:12.218
I did.

01:47:13.677 --> 01:47:14.519
I did.

01:47:15.721 --> 01:47:18.936
So why... Why did you give it to her?

01:47:19.016 --> 01:47:21.144
Mel, you divorced me.

01:47:21.393 --> 01:47:22.394
You left me!

01:47:22.478 --> 01:47:24.025
You didn't fight.

01:47:24.605 --> 01:47:26.402
- You didn't fight.
- Mel.

01:47:26.482 --> 01:47:29.702
No, you used me to work
and take care of you until you made it.

01:47:30.194 --> 01:47:31.282
You never loved me.

01:47:31.362 --> 01:47:33.581
- Mel, that's not true. I loved you.
- Then why?

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:36.785
Why did you give it all to her, huh?

01:47:38.077 --> 01:47:41.250
Why are you here with her and not me?

01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:43.377
You promised me forever.

01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:46.380
You promised me forever,
and she was there all the time.

01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:48.924
No, no. That is not true, Mel.

01:47:49.004 --> 01:47:50.676
I never cheated on you.

01:47:50.756 --> 01:47:52.094
Then why?

01:47:52.174 --> 01:47:54.051
I never cheated on you, Mel.

01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:55.552
Never!

01:47:56.804 --> 01:47:58.147
I love you.

01:48:01.225 --> 01:48:02.568
I always will.

01:48:04.603 --> 01:48:05.445
Good.

01:48:06.605 --> 01:48:08.152
Then make her jump off the boat.

01:48:08.857 --> 01:48:09.695
- Mel, Mel.
- Come on.

01:48:09.775 --> 01:48:11.402
So we can start our life together.

01:48:11.485 --> 01:48:13.824
- No, come on, get up. Let's go get her.
- No, Mel, Mel.

01:48:13.904 --> 01:48:14.746
Get up!

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.908
Listen, let's just talk about this, okay?

01:48:18.492 --> 01:48:19.580
Come on.

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:21.128
Give me the gun.

01:48:21.537 --> 01:48:22.789
Just give me the gun.

01:48:26.375 --> 01:48:28.047
- I heard a shot!
- It came from up top!

01:48:28.127 --> 01:48:29.174
What's going on?

01:48:30.421 --> 01:48:31.468
Jump!

01:48:33.048 --> 01:48:34.011
Jump!

01:48:34.091 --> 01:48:35.262
You better jump!

01:48:56.155 --> 01:48:57.873
Mel, what are you doing?

01:48:59.408 --> 01:49:00.626
Mel.

01:49:03.579 --> 01:49:05.417
Where are you going, huh?

01:49:05.497 --> 01:49:07.124
Stop, bitch, before I shoot you in the...

01:49:17.176 --> 01:49:18.847
Give me the ring.

01:49:18.927 --> 01:49:19.848
What ring?

01:49:19.928 --> 01:49:21.396
That ring, bitch!

01:49:22.723 --> 01:49:23.850
Give it to me.

01:49:24.266 --> 01:49:25.813
You bitches are something.

01:49:25.893 --> 01:49:28.315
The first wife puts in all the work,

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:30.567
and you whores reap the benefits?

01:49:30.647 --> 01:49:32.695
No, ma'am. Give it here.

01:49:33.567 --> 01:49:34.659
Give it to me.

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:36.995
No!

01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:39.077
Robert!

01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:42.913
I need to stop the boat.

01:49:42.993 --> 01:49:44.666
Okay. Okay.

01:49:56.507 --> 01:49:58.100
Pull the throttle.

01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:11.275
Okay. Are you okay?

01:50:11.355 --> 01:50:12.948
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:50:13.649 --> 01:50:14.821
Okay, babe.

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:19.324
I need you to get in the tender,
and I need you to go get the crew.

01:50:19.404 --> 01:50:20.326
The crew?

01:50:21.031 --> 01:50:22.749
She made them jump.

01:50:23.534 --> 01:50:24.955
- Go.
- I'm not leaving you!

01:50:25.035 --> 01:50:27.129
Go, baby. I'm bleeding out.

01:50:28.205 --> 01:50:29.206
Robert.

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:30.586
They can help me.

01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:32.092
Go!

01:50:36.255 --> 01:50:37.302
Be careful.

01:50:40.175 --> 01:50:41.393
Hurry, baby.

01:50:41.885 --> 01:50:42.727
Hurry.

01:50:56.984 --> 01:50:58.531
Robert.

01:51:01.572 --> 01:51:03.950
It's all your fault, Robert.

01:51:07.244 --> 01:51:08.712
Now look at you.
