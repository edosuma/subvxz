- He's an amorous, French cartoon skunk.

00:26.053 --> 00:28.958
It was so funny. Every
episode a female cat

00:28.983 --> 00:30.837
would get a white stripe down its back

00:30.862 --> 00:32.917
and Pepé would think
it was a girl skunk,

00:32.943 --> 00:35.810
and he'd chase her and
hold her down and kiss her.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.564
Sounds like a date rapist.

00:39.634 --> 00:41.562
It wasn't really a date.

00:41.587 --> 00:43.579
So he's just a regular rapist.

cat, and you'd just laugh your head off.
