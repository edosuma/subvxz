Hello. Come, let's see some
beautiful sites together.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.979
Hello, Tree.
Thank you for shade.

00:46.981 --> 00:48.514
Hello, Mountain Cat.

00:48.516 --> 00:51.150
Thank you for controlling
local rat population.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.551
Hello, Windmill.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.220
Thank you for the cheese ride
and ball cooling.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.389
Next week, bullet trains.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.025
Hello...!

01:00.027 --> 01:02.327
Hey, Dad. Are you busy?

01:02.329 --> 01:05.064
I was thinking we could
spend some time together.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.665
Okay, are you a
television set,

01:06.667 --> 01:07.766
or the Internet?

01:07.768 --> 01:08.734
No.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.169
Oh, then no.
No, thank you.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.403
Are you sure?

01:11.405 --> 01:13.238
Cause there's a
three-day weekend coming up

01:13.240 --> 01:15.507
and I thought maybe you and I
can finally go fishing

01:15.509 --> 01:17.009
like we've been
talking about.

01:17.011 --> 01:20.279
Aw, sorry, Chris, I can't.
I got insanity practice.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.547
(yelling hysterically)

01:21.549 --> 01:24.083
Pinwheels! Pinwheels in my head!

01:24.085 --> 01:25.751
Voices! Angry fish!

01:25.753 --> 01:27.386
How's he doing?
Not good.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.089
He still thinks this is
"practice" of some sort.

01:30.091 --> 01:33.092
But you promised
we'd go fishing.

01:33.094 --> 01:36.261
Aw, Chris, I was just
lying to you so you'd go away.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.465
But, if you leave me alone now,
I'll give you a billion dollars.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.633
You've got a deal!

01:41.635 --> 01:43.068
Peter, you know,
i-it might help Chris

01:43.070 --> 01:45.104
to be able to spend
some time with his father.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.438
Well, what's in it
for ol' Pete?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.639
He's your son.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.274
Don't you want someone
to bond with.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.044
No. I only form
unspoken bonds.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.074
You guys, that was my mom.

02:22.076 --> 02:23.809
She said that
Daddy broke his leg.

02:23.811 --> 02:24.810
How?!

02:24.812 --> 02:27.479
A-Apparently, he got hurt
at the mall.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.982
Carter, please stop
doing that.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.817
We need to get you
some new corduroys.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.453
No! None of the other boys
are wearing corduroys!

02:34.455 --> 02:35.687
I want dungarees!

02:35.689 --> 02:37.589
You're going to
get hurt doing that.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.759
No I'm not!
I'm the <i>champ</i> at doing this!

02:40.761 --> 02:42.461
Ow! You jinxed me!

02:42.463 --> 02:43.529
Aw, damn it!

02:43.531 --> 02:44.863
Hey, call that beeping cart

02:44.865 --> 02:47.099
that carries around
the fat black people.

02:47.101 --> 02:49.501
Well, I guess Babs has
her work cut out for her.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.271
Actually, Mom can't take care
of him, she's out of town

02:52.273 --> 02:55.741
doing a photo shoot for the
cover of <i>Veins Magazine.</i>

02:58.278 --> 03:00.345
So, are you gonna go
take care of him, Mom?

03:00.347 --> 03:03.615
I can't go. I've got to go get
my hair very minutely changed

03:03.617 --> 03:06.919
and then spend the next 14 hours
trying to get people to notice.

03:09.055 --> 03:10.322
Well...?

03:10.324 --> 03:12.124
Lois, move.
You're blocking the TV.

03:12.126 --> 03:14.293
(laughs)
What do you think?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.894
I think you're
blocking the TV.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.697
Peter, i-is there anything
you want to say to me?

03:18.699 --> 03:19.831
(sighs)

03:19.833 --> 03:22.234
All right.
Amy at work kissed me.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.136
It   <i>i</i>true
that I did not step away,

03:24.138 --> 03:25.537
but I did not lean in.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.972
However, in my defense,

03:26.974 --> 03:29.641
she had recently gotten
her hair done differently.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.311
I was actually thinking that
maybe <i>you</i> could go help Daddy.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.745
Well, not me, Mom.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.180
Last time I was
at Grandpa's,

03:35.182 --> 03:37.716
I beat him at checkers and he
punched one of my hogans.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.017
Well, what about Chris?

03:39.019 --> 03:40.652
Wai-Wait, where is Chris?

03:40.654 --> 03:42.054
He's upstairs
in his room.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.022
That's odd.
He never misses a meal.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.324
I-I better go check on him.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.525
Yeah, good idea.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.428
I better check on my
hairless twin in the storm shed.

03:51.264 --> 03:53.899
Close the door,
the moonlight burns!

03:53.901 --> 03:56.401
It's almost Christmas.
It's almost Christmas.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.669
Christmas?!

03:57.671 --> 03:59.104
Yes. Keep being good

03:59.106 --> 04:02.107
and all the eggshells and
coffee grounds will be yours.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.209
Can I meet the family?

04:04.211 --> 04:06.044
You've overstepped!
No Christmas!

04:06.046 --> 04:07.312
(door slams shut)

04:09.616 --> 04:11.617
Hey, Chris. Are you okay?

04:11.619 --> 04:14.019
Holy crap, it smells
like farts in here.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.787
Those are <i>my</i> farts.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.457
Why doesn't Dad ever
want to spend time with me?

04:18.459 --> 04:19.992
Chris, come here.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.060
Sit down.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.096
You know I love you,
right, sweetie?

04:24.098 --> 04:26.531
Mom... not in front
of my posters.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.400
And your father
loves you, too.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.370
He just has trouble
expressing his emotions.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.205
PETER:
I love <i>Mike & Molly!</i>

04:33.207 --> 04:35.874
I love Mike
and I also love Molly!

04:35.876 --> 04:37.976
And I don't care
who knows it!

04:37.978 --> 04:40.279
You know, Chris,
you've got a grandpa

04:40.281 --> 04:42.047
who could use
your help right now.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.616
I'm sure he'd enjoy
spending time with you.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.852
Okay... I'll give
it a shot.

04:49.422 --> 04:50.956
You're not gonna
kill yourself, are you?

04:50.958 --> 04:53.725
That would be a severe black
mark on my record as a mom.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.928
Oh, I'd have to make up stories
of a severe mental illness.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.731
Make is seem a <i>miracle</i>
<i>you made it this long.</i>

04:59.733 --> 05:02.167
I could do that.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.673
Sucks about your leg, Grandpa.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.074
How you been doin'?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.976
Well, let me tell you,
this is awful.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.344
I-I'm so bored.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.479
I can't sleep,
I-I just have to lie here

05:14.481 --> 05:16.315
and wait for my
stupid leg to heal.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.150
Oh, I'm really
sorry, Grandpa.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.452
And the worst part about it,
is I can't have sex.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.288
God! I wish there was a way
I could just do it myself.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.258
You know, just-just to be done
and napping within four minutes.

05:26.260 --> 05:29.528
Let me show you something.

05:29.530 --> 05:33.465
That... was... amazing!

05:33.467 --> 05:35.534
And Lynda Carter
wasn't actually here?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.536
No! That was just
in your mind.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.704
Incredible!

05:38.706 --> 05:39.838
So-So you can do that like,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.373
wh-what, once a year
or something?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.974
No. You can do it basically

05:42.976 --> 05:44.776
whenever you're not
doing something else.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.977
Cool!

05:45.979 --> 05:48.213
Hey, next time I want to
try it with <i>my</i> hand.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.718
Hey, Grandpa.
What should we do now?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.119
You wanna order a pizza?

05:54.121 --> 05:55.687
Well, that doesn't sound
very exciting.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.890

06:02.396 --> 06:05.364
Wow, he's really fast.
Hey, I got an idea,

06:05.366 --> 06:07.699
let's put in <i>two</i> different
orders and have 'em race!

06:07.701 --> 06:09.901

You think it'll
crash the system?

06:09.903 --> 06:11.870

06:12.905 --> 06:14.906
Here's your pizza.
That's $16.50.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.641

a game with you.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.377

06:19.913 --> 06:22.381
Yes. Your money is in

what about Mom?

I promise she'll be dead

But, Grandpa, I don't
even want the money.

want it, either.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.799
Good, 'cause
you're not getting it.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.301
Come on, what
are you doing?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.503
Listen, Carter, you take
me out of your will,

08:58.505 --> 09:00.572
I'm taking you
out of mine.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.675
Peter, that wasn't your will,
that was your birth certificate.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.843
Oh, no!

09:04.845 --> 09:06.011
(gasps)

09:06.013 --> 09:07.245
There's no light!

09:07.247 --> 09:09.080
There's only fire!

09:09.082 --> 09:11.850
Look, Carter, I suppose
you're entitled to do
what you want,

09:11.852 --> 09:14.386
but, you know, I'm just
saying, if it were me,

09:14.388 --> 09:16.421
I would give all the
money to charity.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.589
Oh, yeah?
Which charity?

09:17.591 --> 09:19.357
Well, there are
just so many

09:19.359 --> 09:20.859
that do such
great work.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.160
Name just one.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.862
Um... well,
you know...

09:23.864 --> 09:26.531
Poor... Green...

09:26.533 --> 09:28.233
Whale... Guns...

09:28.235 --> 09:29.568
Books?

09:29.570 --> 09:31.603
You are
such a fraud.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.973
Why won't anyone help us?!

09:39.345 --> 09:41.446
What the hell?
I can't believe your dad's

09:41.448 --> 09:43.014
giving all his cash
to Chris!

09:43.016 --> 09:45.584
I know it's strange,
but in the end
it's his money,

09:45.586 --> 09:47.218
so who really cares?

09:47.220 --> 09:48.920
Well, yeah, but...

09:48.922 --> 09:50.455
But what?

09:50.457 --> 09:53.458
Peter... did you marry
me for my money?

09:53.460 --> 09:55.794
Of course not, Lois,
but even you can't deny

09:55.796 --> 09:58.029
it was always gonna
be a huge perk.

09:58.031 --> 10:01.199
D-Did I use that
right? Perk?
Yes, Peter.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.402
Yeah, I thought so,
but then it just sounded
kind of weird when I said it.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.804
It was fine.
Thanks.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.540
Anyway, I don't
plan on losing out
on any of that money.

10:08.542 --> 10:11.776
So if you ask me, we
got to start sucking up
to Chris right away.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.812
What? Wh-What are
you talking about?

10:13.814 --> 10:15.647
I'm talking about
brownnosing Chris

10:15.649 --> 10:17.582
and getting on
his good side perk.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.384
No, that's wrong.
No "perk."

10:19.386 --> 10:22.420
Okay, my bad.
But I've been counting
on that money, Lois.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.789
It's always been critical
to my master plan.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.291
What master plan?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.426
Look, I never
told you this, but...

10:28.428 --> 10:31.896
for years now, I've been
planning on retiring at 45

10:31.898 --> 10:35.367
so I can work on
finding a cure for
Ballzheimers disease.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.802
Peter, are
those testicles?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.471
Wh-where did
you get those?

10:39.473 --> 10:42.007
(crying):
I don't remember!

10:45.411 --> 10:47.979
Hey, hey, there he is!

10:47.981 --> 10:50.815
Oh, boy, hot dogs and
Nintendo, huh, Chris?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.018
Dad, what are you doing?
What's going on?

10:53.020 --> 10:54.185
(laughs)

10:54.187 --> 10:55.353
Good one, Chris!

10:55.355 --> 10:56.521
(laughing)

10:56.523 --> 10:58.289
Good one!
Why are you dressed
like that?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.958
I don't know. I-I
just kind of felt

10:59.960 --> 11:01.359
like this is what
cool people wear.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.095
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you
and me do a secret handshake

11:04.097 --> 11:06.164
that has way too many steps
to remember, all right?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.867
Okay. Shake, bump, bump,
slap, pinky hook,

11:08.869 --> 11:11.536
pretend to slick your hair back,
represent, bump,

11:11.538 --> 11:13.638
one spin, slap high, slap low,

11:13.640 --> 11:16.107
reverse spin, bump, explode,
shake, belly rub,

11:16.109 --> 11:18.610
fake yawn, finger gun,
hitchhiker, hitchhiker,

11:18.612 --> 11:20.779
shimmy shimmy sham sham,
shake, shake, shake, bump,

11:20.781 --> 11:22.347
something smells
and shake again.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.849
Okay, ready?

11:25.785 --> 11:27.852
Oh, my God, it's nighttime.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.658
MAN (on TV):
We now return to the director's
cut of <i>Mission: Impossible 5,</i>

11:33.660 --> 11:36.227
with the step stools
not edited out.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.697
You're coming with me because
I'm definitely over six feet,

11:38.699 --> 11:40.298
and you're not handsome.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.900
Hey, Chris, hey,
you remember that kid

11:41.902 --> 11:43.568
you said was bullying
you at school?

11:43.570 --> 11:44.903
Well, here's his head!

11:44.905 --> 11:46.004
(screaming)

11:46.006 --> 11:47.172
That's not even him!

11:47.174 --> 11:48.707
That's the deaf kid!

11:48.709 --> 11:50.675
Oh, that was
sign language.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.744
I thought he was
trying to defend himself

11:52.746 --> 11:54.646
with terrible karate.

11:56.649 --> 12:00.685
Chris, I want to share with you
a timeworn father/son tradition.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.654
I am gonna show you
a film comedy

12:02.656 --> 12:04.823
from my youth
that won't hold up.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.358
Welcome to the classic comedy,
Meatballs.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.827
Oh, that sounds great.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.762
Is it about a pasta
factory or something?

12:10.764 --> 12:12.197
No, that's part of the joke.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.565
Who's the guy?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.500
That's not a guy.
That's the hot chick!

12:15.502 --> 12:16.835
Where are her boobs?

12:16.837 --> 12:18.703
Flat with a decent face
was the best

12:18.705 --> 12:19.904
we could hope for back then.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.340
Miley Cyrus had sex
with a foam finger

12:22.342 --> 12:24.342
at, like, 6:00 p.m.
Central Time.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.511
This movie has a canoe
that slowly sinks.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.346
All right, you know what?
Forget it!

12:28.348 --> 12:31.249
I'm just gonna take my VCR,
my VCR head-cleaning tape,

12:31.251 --> 12:34.185
my VCR head-cleaning spray,
my head-cleaning rag,

12:34.187 --> 12:37.155
and my rewinder, and just
get the hell out of here.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.595
MAN (on TV):
<i>We now return to</i> At the Movies

12:43.597 --> 12:46.197
With Two Guys Who Watch
the Films On Their iPhones.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.699
Good evening.
First off, we're going

12:47.701 --> 12:49.400
to review Paul Greengrass'
Captain Phillips.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.035
What did you think, Bill?

12:51.037 --> 12:52.604
Well, it got off
to a great start,

12:52.606 --> 12:54.906
but when it was my turn
to play <i>Words With Friends,</i>

12:54.908 --> 12:56.241
it really took
me out of it.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.776
Well, that's a shame,
because visually...

12:57.778 --> 13:00.111
(phone whooshes)
Ooh!

13:00.113 --> 13:03.815
ANNOUNCER:
<i>When we come back, the guys</i>
<i>will review</i> American Hustle.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.316
Hmm?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.085
Hey, you guys.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.586
Geez, Peter,
you look exhausted.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.655
Ugh, I am. I've
been busting my ass

13:10.657 --> 13:13.124
for the last week trying
to suck up to Chris.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.726
To Chris?
What the hell for?

13:14.728 --> 13:15.994
Well, Carter
kind of decided

13:15.996 --> 13:17.896
he's gonna leave all
his money to Chris.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.964
So, I've been trying to
get on his good side.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.100
I even cleaned his room
for him the other day.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.701
Wish I hadn't done that.

13:24.603 --> 13:27.005
Chris, our
bath is ready.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.940
I... uh...

13:28.942 --> 13:30.975
I don't... I don't know
what to do now.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.178
I... I don't have
the parenting skills necessary

13:33.180 --> 13:34.412
to deal with this.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.314
I say we never
speak of this again.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.650
I... I might move.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.585
You know what?
I say, good for Chris

13:40.587 --> 13:42.954
and whatever lucky girl
he ends up marrying.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.423
Yeah, or lucky guy,
if he ends up being gay.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.958
Lucky guy?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.526
Wait a minute.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.695
You guys just gave me an idea!

13:50.697 --> 13:52.030
(playing tuba)

13:52.032 --> 13:53.498
(laughs)

13:53.500 --> 13:55.633
What's he doing up there?
He's a cat!

13:55.635 --> 13:58.703
He can't play no tuba!

13:58.705 --> 14:00.004
No, wait!

14:00.006 --> 14:02.440
Actually, you guys
gave me two ideas!

14:02.442 --> 14:03.775
(snoring)

14:03.777 --> 14:08.012
Mumbling while I sleep
to indicate dream content.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.380
Chris, Chris, wake up.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.449
I have something very
important to ask you.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.652
Chris, there comes a time when
every man looks at his son

14:14.654 --> 14:18.790
and thinks, "I want to take
this to the next level."

14:20.793 --> 14:24.362
Chris Griffin...
will you marry me?

14:24.364 --> 14:27.732
What?! Is it even legal
for a man to marry his son?

14:27.734 --> 14:29.133
It is in Vermont.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.336
As long as it's a man and a
man, anything goes up there.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.137
They're a bunch of
liberal degenerates.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.039
I don't know.
It seems really weird.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.408
I mean, aren't men
supposed to marry women?

14:37.410 --> 14:40.011
No, no, no, that's just
all of human history

14:40.013 --> 14:41.646
except for the
last five months.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.147
We'll just be
like best pals.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.849
And besides, there's
plenty of people

14:44.851 --> 14:46.417
who are married
and don't have sex.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.186
Like Will Smith
and that pit bull.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.988
Why do you even
want to marry me?

14:49.990 --> 14:52.357
It's time to settle down
and simplify things,

14:52.359 --> 14:55.226
like maybe having one ATM
card and one bank account.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.694
Say, yours.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.597
Oh. I get it.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.399
So, what do you say?

15:02.835 --> 15:05.670
When you're married, you get
to spend all your time together,

15:05.672 --> 15:08.439
doing things like playing catch
and going fishing, right?

15:08.441 --> 15:10.341
Well, the best marriages
give each other space,

15:10.343 --> 15:11.676
but, yes, Chris.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.345
Then, yes, I will
marry you, Dad!

15:14.347 --> 15:16.781
Oh, that's
wonderful news!

15:16.783 --> 15:19.183
You should know this
ring is very special.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.052
It used to belong
to your mother.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.054
Wait. What <i>about</i> Mom?

15:23.056 --> 15:24.923
I'm afraid that's
over, Chris.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.257
Lois, wake up.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.226
I need you to sign
this legal document.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.261
Huh? Wha-What is this?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.363
It's a petition
to force that hot mom

15:32.365 --> 15:34.399
to wear something appropriate
at PTA meetings.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.534
Oh, thank God.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.706
(cans rattling, tires squeaking)

15:41.708 --> 15:43.841
(engine revving)

15:46.946 --> 15:48.746
No, Dad.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.215
I don't know
what normal is anymore.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.629
So now you know my complete
sexual history, Chris.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.466
Wow. I'm surprised you got
fooled by a bear in a wig.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.501
It wasn't a wig,
it was a hair system.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.970
Well, whatever.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.805
Why do we have
all these appointments?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.740
Wedding DJ, florist.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.509
Because, Chris, it takes time
to plan a perfect wedding.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.178
You don't want
to jump the gun.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.680
You know, like when you
respond to a text too quickly.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.084
(whooshing)

16:28.320 --> 16:30.388
(whooshing)

16:36.328 --> 16:38.663
So, should we get started
with your bridal registry?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.531
Yeah, um, I'd like
to furnish my kitchen

16:40.533 --> 16:42.767
as if I'm the greatest
chef in the world,

16:42.769 --> 16:44.202
even though I've
never cooked before.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.703
That's what we do!
Okay, great.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.538
All right, we'll start
with the nine grand

16:47.540 --> 16:49.941
in copper-bottom
cookware.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.714
Holy wack-a-zoly!

16:56.716 --> 16:57.982
Dad!
What?

16:57.984 --> 17:00.318
Don't "what" me.
You know what you did.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.688
Hey, I may be your husband and
your dad, but I'm still a man.

17:06.825 --> 17:09.327
Yeah, we're looking to plan our
post-wedding Sunday breakfast.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.995
You know,
when everyone's sick of us.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.196
Of course.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.332
Excellent. Do you have
a table for the couple

17:14.334 --> 17:16.667
that barely made it through
the weekend without breaking up?

17:16.669 --> 17:18.503
Absolutely. Can I put
them near the couple

17:18.505 --> 17:20.571
that hooked up drunk and now
have to make awkward small talk

17:20.573 --> 17:22.340
until their cab to
the airport arrives?

17:22.342 --> 17:23.574
Sure. And maybe
they could go next

17:23.576 --> 17:25.076
to the vastly-underdressed
cousin

17:25.078 --> 17:27.078
who thinks
the world revolves around him?

17:27.080 --> 17:28.513
I have just the spot.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.747
Will there be a
physically-frail,

17:29.749 --> 17:30.915
fall-down uncle?

17:30.917 --> 17:32.817
Indeed. And we'd like
to have him walk

17:32.819 --> 17:34.185
through a maze
of chair legs.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.586
Anything else?
Yes.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.021
We did invite
a black couple.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.257
Um, even though we only met them
three months ago,

17:39.259 --> 17:41.325
but we would like them
to be prominently featured

17:41.327 --> 17:44.328
to let the other guests know how
tolerant and wonderful we are.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.234
I'm excited for
your first dance.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.936
And now we're
ready to add music.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.104
What's your song?

17:53.106 --> 17:55.039
You know, I've given it
a lot of thought,

17:55.041 --> 17:57.208
and I went with the most
romantic song ever,

17:57.210 --> 18:00.611
"Stars And Stripes Forever"
by John Philip Sousa.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.879
♪

18:01.881 --> 18:03.047
March! March!
March! March!

18:03.049 --> 18:04.849
Can you feel the
soldiers, Chris?

18:04.851 --> 18:06.284
So many have fallen.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.885
And this is why
they were fighting.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.787
For a man to marry his son

18:09.789 --> 18:11.222
in a state with
enough trees around

18:11.224 --> 18:13.357
that nobody can
see what's going on.

18:14.626 --> 18:17.495
(organ plays gentle melody)

18:19.465 --> 18:21.566
It was nice of the
guests at the cat funeral

18:21.568 --> 18:23.034
to stay for our wedding.

18:23.036 --> 18:24.702
Yeah, and I bet
you're especially happy

18:24.704 --> 18:26.404
we're getting married
on a Thursday.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.272
School, yuck, right?!

18:28.274 --> 18:30.374
Welcome, friends, loved ones,

18:30.376 --> 18:33.044
and people who are waiting
for the 3:00 check-in time

18:33.046 --> 18:34.412
with nothing better to do.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.080
Just let us put
our bags in there.

18:36.082 --> 18:38.416
I'm literally gonna
grab my shorts and leave.

18:38.418 --> 18:42.386
I understand the two of you
have written your own vows?

18:42.388 --> 18:44.155
Chris, to express my love,

18:44.157 --> 18:47.325
I turn to the words of the only
poet that blue collar,

18:47.327 --> 18:50.962
New England scumbags
like me know: Robert Frost.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.798
"Two roads diverged
in a wood, and I...

18:53.800 --> 18:56.434
I took the one less traveled."

18:56.436 --> 18:58.970
Now, I ain't no scholar,
but if that's not a metaphor

18:58.972 --> 19:01.339
for major-league butt stuff,
I don't know what is.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.107
Thank you. Chris?

19:03.109 --> 19:04.909
LOIS:
Stop the wedding!

19:06.111 --> 19:08.446
Lois! How did you
find out about this?

19:08.448 --> 19:10.281
Peter, several people
have called the police

19:10.283 --> 19:11.616
about a man marrying his son.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.151
It's not normal!

19:13.153 --> 19:15.586
Peter? Peter
Griffin?

19:15.588 --> 19:17.588
Oh, God.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.290
Is everyone
from your past here

19:19.292 --> 19:21.025
to walk you down
the aisle?!

19:21.027 --> 19:22.493
Peter, you
cannot do this!

19:22.495 --> 19:24.362
You cannot
marry your son!

19:24.364 --> 19:26.464
I don't care how much
money Daddy's left him.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.965
Don't listen
to your mother, Chris.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.634
It's 'cause of her
we have bedtimes!

19:29.636 --> 19:31.502
Chris, come on,
we're going home!

19:31.504 --> 19:33.437
He can't make
you do this.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.373
But, Mom,
I  <i>want</i>to do this.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.774
What?

19:36.776 --> 19:40.311
I know he's marrying me
for my money, but I don't care.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.181
Dad and I spent more time
together planning this wedding

19:43.183 --> 19:44.715
than we ever have before.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.284
And if being married means

19:46.286 --> 19:50.454
I get to spend even more time
with my dad, then it's worth it.

19:50.456 --> 19:54.825
Wait. You knew all along I
just wanted you for your money?

19:54.827 --> 19:57.161
Yeah, Dad, I did.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.530
Wow.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.966
Oh, boy, I've
been a real jerk.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.367
I'm sorry, Chris.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.002
But you know what?

20:05.004 --> 20:07.572
I'm gonna make it up to
you, starting right now.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.841
Chris Griffin...
will you be my son?

20:10.843 --> 20:13.010
Yes, Dad.

20:13.012 --> 20:17.348
OMG, the photographer is,
like, obsessed with me.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.917
Well, let's all go home,
you guys.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.153
I think we've had enough
excitement for one day.

20:22.155 --> 20:24.088
Yeah, and
I guess I learned

20:24.090 --> 20:25.923
it's wrong to take
your son to Vermont

20:25.925 --> 20:27.225
under false
pretenses

20:27.227 --> 20:29.260
to try to marry him
for his inheritance.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.494
You... you should've
known that.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.363
Well, we should
probably get going.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.765
I think this
adventure is over.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.702
PETER:
<i>Interestingly, however,</i>
<i>I did run into Chris again.</i>

20:37.704 --> 20:39.870
<i>It was on the Upper West</i>
<i>Side of Manhattan.</i>

20:39.872 --> 20:41.772
<i>He was with another dad.</i>
<i>I was with another son.</i>

20:41.774 --> 20:45.009
<i>But it was nice reminiscing</i>
<i>about old times.</i>

20:45.011 --> 20:46.344
<i>For you kids watching,</i>

20:46.346 --> 20:47.545
<i>this is a reference</i>
<i>to a Woody Allen movie.</i>

20:47.547 --> 20:49.680
<i>He also married one</i>
<i>of his children.</i>
