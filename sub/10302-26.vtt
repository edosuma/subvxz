02:29.400 --> 02:31.675
You wouldn't know this,
but it's tough out there...

02:31.880 --> 02:34.758
...for those of us without a couch
growing out of our butt.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.471
A fat woman Godzilla's
into the shoe store today...

02:40.720 --> 02:43.678
...asks for something she could wear
to walk in the woods.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.150
Jokingly, I suggest she wear a sign
that says:

02:46.360 --> 02:49.113
"Don't shoot.
From the front I look human."

02:50.720 --> 02:53.678
You'd think a woman could take
a little good-humoured teasing...

02:53.880 --> 02:55.108
...but what does she do?

02:55.360 --> 02:57.749
Complains to the owner,
gets a gift certificate...

02:57.960 --> 02:59.837
...for $200 worth of free shoes.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.640
And you know whose pay cheque
that's gonna come out of.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.588
- Kelly's?
- Damn right...

03:04.800 --> 03:07.268
...if I could find out
where she hides her purse.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.156
Now for something I wanna look at.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.231
And now on Fox.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.278
It's the new adventures
of Psycho Dad.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.511
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.911
- Who is the tall dark stranger there?
- There

03:22.160 --> 03:25.630
The one with the gun
And the icy stare

03:25.880 --> 03:29.555
The one with the scalp
Of his ex-wife's hair

03:29.800 --> 03:31.552
- Psycho Dad
- Pyscho Dad

03:31.800 --> 03:35.190
- Psycho Dad, Pyscho Dad
- Psycho Dad, Pyscho Dad

03:35.440 --> 03:39.911
He's a durn good pa
But he hates the law

03:40.120 --> 03:42.315
- Chopping Reno to eat it raw
- Raw

03:42.560 --> 03:46.269
- Psycho Dad!
- Psycho Dad!

03:51.760 --> 03:54.274
Now with less violence,
but more kinky sex and nudity...

03:54.480 --> 03:56.072
...for a cleaner and saner America.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.077
Oh, Peg, I'm so excited.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.197
Al, I hate Psycho Dad. Can't we just...?

04:00.440 --> 04:02.112
There's nothing
in heaven and earth...

04:02.320 --> 04:04.880
...that will stop me
from watching Psycho Dad.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.630
So this God person,
what do you think she looks like?

04:25.320 --> 04:27.675
Hey, it smells like
something's cooking in here.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.115
Our TV set blew up.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.635
"Buy a second-hand TV," you said.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.792
"For 10 bucks you can't go wrong,"
you said.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.279
Well, now look. Twenty years later
and the damn thing's broken.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.596
Al, what is the big deal?
Just go out and buy a new one.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.195
We'll just buy a new one. Well, spank
my bottom, why didn't I think of that.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.398
Hello, Wally's World of free TVs?

04:55.640 --> 04:59.553
What do you have on sale today
for absolutely nothing?

05:00.520 --> 05:02.192
Guys, I got a solution...

05:02.440 --> 05:05.796
...though God knows
it's not for all your problems.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.398
They have tryouts for a new
game show called Touchdown Trivia.

05:10.640 --> 05:15.191
First prize is $10,000 and there's
no one who knows more about sports...

05:15.400 --> 05:17.994
...or is more trivial than you, Al.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.475
$10,000?
With that, I could buy a big screen...

05:21.680 --> 05:23.432
...a satellite dish, have money left...

05:23.640 --> 05:26.518
...to change the locks in the house
and watch all this in peace.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.030
I'm going to those auditions.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.635
- Don't wait up for me.
- I wasn't going to.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.915
I was talking to Jefferson.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.712
First, let me congratulate you
on passing the written test.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.793
For the finals, we'll play
a simulated game of sports trivia...

05:49.000 --> 05:50.228
...both national and local.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.158
- Any questions?
- I'd like to know...

05:52.400 --> 05:54.516
Yeah, places please.

05:58.320 --> 06:02.108
Now we will introduce our host,
Travis James.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.710
Man, I hate rehearsals.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.349
First contestant is Al Bundy.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.158
Yes, Travis. I was born...

06:21.360 --> 06:24.875
Then we go to our second contestant,
Max Weinberg.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.350
Max... That's short for...

06:28.800 --> 06:30.597
Nothing. Fine. Okay.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.594
- Our third contestant is Mike McKenzy.
- Hi, Travis.

06:34.880 --> 06:38.236
Don't speak to me, Mike.
It's just a rehearsal, okay?

06:38.480 --> 06:41.711
Now it's time for Touchdown Trivia.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.313
Okay, contestants...

06:43.560 --> 06:46.518
...we're all familiar with the famous
running back O.J. Simpson.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.877
For five yards,
what do the initials O.J. stand for?

06:50.600 --> 06:53.068
- AI.
- Orenthal James.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.515
That's correct!

07:01.800 --> 07:04.075
Eat my dust.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.790
Okay, the second question.
What was the World Bowl?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.355
- AI.
- Title game of the now defunct...

07:12.560 --> 07:16.235
...World Football League.
Travis, excuse me.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.668
Do you want me to rush...

07:17.880 --> 07:21.111
...or you want me to pretend
that I have to think about these?

07:23.960 --> 07:27.270
Here's a 10-yard question.
What occupational oddity is shared...

07:27.520 --> 07:31.069
...by Henry Aaron,
Willie Mays and Babe Ruth?

07:31.320 --> 07:34.392
- Mike.
- They're all baseball players.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.599
Been in this country long, Mike?
Be a little more specific, please.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.555
- Max.
- All Hall of Fame baseball players.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.473
Dress a Barbie, Max.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.993
Let a real man answer this.

07:49.240 --> 07:52.596
They all started and ended
their careers in the same city...

07:52.840 --> 07:56.469
...but for different teams.
- That is correct.

08:02.320 --> 08:06.916
Next question. Can you name one
of two women golfers to win...? Max.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.639
- Mickey Wright.
- Correct.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.278
Women's golf is not a sport.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.358
Neither is spitting for distance.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.795
But it can be.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.674
Women's golf.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.833
All right, next question. What famous
Native American midget wrestler...?

08:27.080 --> 08:28.513
- AI.
- Skylo Low.

08:28.720 --> 08:29.914
That's correct.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.679
Okay, Mr. Bundy, our final question
pertains to a local sporting event.

09:23.280 --> 09:27.637
What high school has won the most
city championships in baseball?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.675
- The O'Leary Bucket Kickers.
- Correct.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.116
Congratulations to have mastered
that amount of sports knowledge...

09:40.320 --> 09:43.198
...I can only assume
you have absolutely no life.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.874
None whatsoever, Travis.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.279
By the way, when do you guys want
me to come back for the real thing?

09:53.440 --> 09:56.955
Well, gee, I'm sorry, Mr. Bundy,
we won't be having you back at all.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.909
What? Well, how come? I won.

10:01.560 --> 10:06.190
Well, according to our researchers, you
scored extremely low in personality.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.196
Oh, how...? How low?

10:10.440 --> 10:14.752
Well, let me put it to you this way. It
was somewhere between Joe Piscopo...

10:15.000 --> 10:18.072
...and the fat kid who played
on Head of the Class.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.718
Look, you know what?
If I liked you at all, I'd really be sorry.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.872
Well, but wait a second.
You can't do this to me. I'm a legend.

10:25.120 --> 10:28.556
I scored four touchdowns in one game
at Polk High.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.872
Four touchdowns
in high school football.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.712
Wow.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.756
Look, Mr. Bundy,
we're looking for people...

10:41.000 --> 10:43.514
...that are young, smart
and energetic.

10:50.680 --> 10:54.958
Or if you really want to be a shoe-in,
someone with sex appeal.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.749
I can't go on a sports-trivia show.
I don't know anything about sports.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.589
Well, so you went to class every day,
you don't know anything about school.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.311
Oh, yeah?
Then how come they gave me a thing?

11:15.520 --> 11:16.748
- A diploma?
- Yeah.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.793
Because you tried.
Sweetheart, please.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.678
It's for a new TV.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.390
Come on. I'll tell you what,
I'll order the cartoon channel for you.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.276
Okay.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.110
I'll go upstairs and call in sick
for today. My boss isn't gonna like it...

11:32.360 --> 11:34.828
...but at least somebody's
appreciating me for my mind.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.354
It's the basement.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.871
Bud, now listen, you've helped
Kelly with her schoolwork.

11:55.120 --> 11:59.477
Tell me, is she capable of,
you know, anything?

12:00.040 --> 12:03.919
Oh, sure. You just gotta work
within her limitations.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.597
Kelly's brain...

12:07.920 --> 12:09.672
Kelly's brain...

12:10.480 --> 12:11.708
...can hold anything.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.514
You just gotta make sure
of two things before you start.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.159
One, that it's totally empty.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.630
Well, we know that.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.471
And two, you gotta feed
her information slowly.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.029
A drop at a time until she's full.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.713
Full?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.629
Oh, yeah.
Kelly's brain can actually get full.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.958
Then you gotta be really careful...

12:34.200 --> 12:38.273
...because each new fact after that
will totally replace an old one.

12:39.320 --> 12:43.472
That's how come she forgot to put on
a blouse the day she took driver's test.

12:44.520 --> 12:48.069
No wonder why her license
expires every 60 days.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.238
Daddy, they said okay.
What do I have to do?

12:52.520 --> 12:55.990
All right. Good, sweetheart. First, tell
me everything you know about sports.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.792
I know that you scored four
touchdowns in one game for Polk High.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.356
Very good. What else?

13:03.720 --> 13:06.951
Golf spelled backwards is flog.

13:11.480 --> 13:15.109
All right. I thought
this was gonna take a long time.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.476
Don't worry.
You just sit down right here.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.234
In 48 hours, you're gonna know
so much about sports...

13:20.440 --> 13:22.590
...you're gonna be like the son
I always wanted.

15:04.120 --> 15:08.557
And now on to yachting.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.992
Daddy?

15:20.400 --> 15:22.311
I'm full.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.472
Thank God.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.355
Well, we've got two hours
to catch up on our sleep.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.639
Now, don't learn anything new
until this game show is over.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.075
How am I supposed to do that?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.391
Follow your mother around.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.793
Welcome to Touchdown Trivia.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.276
Here's the star of our show,
Travis James.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.477
Okay. Okay, I know we're anxious
to win some money...

16:02.680 --> 16:06.753
...so let's get started, shall we?
Our first question in Touchdown Trivia:

16:06.960 --> 16:10.111
What national league batter
set the all-time record for strikeouts...

16:10.320 --> 16:13.596
...in a single season
despite batting over.300?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.991
- Mike.
- Bobby Bonds.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.073
One hundred
and 89 strikeouts in 1970.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.032
- That's correct.
- Yes.

16:23.880 --> 16:26.110
Hey, my buzzer didn't work.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.148
You've gotta squeeze the buzzer,
honey, don... Don't jerk it.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.870
Thanks. I learned something.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.953
Gee, so did I.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.351
Oh, no, Peg.
Travis put a thought into Kelly's head.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.353
That means she lost a fact.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.273
For another five yards.
What national hockey league team...

16:48.480 --> 16:50.869
...won only one game
in franchise history?

16:51.680 --> 16:54.353
- Kelly.
- Montreal Wanderers, 1917.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.869
Won their opener, lost five,
their stadium burned.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.792
Absolutely correct.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.836
Yes.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.877
All right, our next question
is in professional basketball.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.588
In the NBA,
who had the highest percentage...

17:09.800 --> 17:11.597
...of free throws in a single season?

17:12.319 --> 17:13.877
- Kelly.
- Calvin Murphy...

17:14.079 --> 17:17.277
...of the Houston Rockets
with a whopping 95.8 percent.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.875
Right again.

17:24.119 --> 17:28.271
Now for 10 yards.
What do Karl Marx, Bob Dylan...

17:28.520 --> 17:31.080
...and heavyweight champion
Sonny Liston have in common?

17:31.760 --> 17:34.558
- Tony.
- They're all communists.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.190
No, that's not what we're looking for.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.753
Mike.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.155
Mamie Van Doren.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.473
Judges?

17:45.680 --> 17:48.911
No, I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Kelly.

17:49.160 --> 17:52.311
They're all on the cover of the
Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.955
Slide that head.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.751
Oh, baby,
you're getting some tonight.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.234
Now before we continue,
let's meet our contestants.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.072
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

18:11.320 --> 18:12.719
Travis might ask a question...

18:12.920 --> 18:16.674
...or worse, tell her something she
doesn't know. She'll lose another fact.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.715
- Our first contestant...
- I'm from Young...

18:19.960 --> 18:24.192
- is Kelly Bundy, a poison disseminator
from right here in Chicago.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.876
- So tell me, Ms. Bundy...
- She's married.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.149
Okay, that's enough chitchat,
let's get back to our game.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.276
Okay, contestants,
you're all even with 10 yards to go.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.516
You all have a chance
at the big money.

19:12.760 --> 19:16.639
This is for all the marbles.
The big enchilada.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.598
Here's the question.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.997
Who led the Chicago Bulls
in scoring six straight...

19:23.360 --> 19:25.237
- Tony.
- Michael Jordan.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.511
No, no, that's incorrect.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.716
Let me finish the question.

19:29.960 --> 19:34.750
Who led the Chicago Bulls in scoring
six straight seasons in the '70s?

19:35.480 --> 19:37.550
- Kelly.
- Bob "Butterbean" Love.

19:37.800 --> 19:41.429
For 10 yards,
that's correct for the game.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.399
She did it. She did it.

19:50.640 --> 19:55.111
Oh, Al, can I have
some tomorrow night too?

19:55.480 --> 19:58.119
Not if I get that TV.

19:58.560 --> 20:02.712
Now, Kelly, as you know, our bonus
question is always in local sports.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.155
You have $1000 that you can keep...

20:05.400 --> 20:08.119
...but if not, you can go
for the run back question...

20:08.360 --> 20:13.639
...and a chance
at a check for $10,000.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.880
- Let's rock.
- Okay.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.998
Al, aren't you afraid they're gonna
ask her the one fact she lost?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.428
What are the odds of that?

20:35.640 --> 20:38.871
I taught her more local stuff
than national, Peg. We can't lose.

20:39.120 --> 20:42.999
Okay, Kelly, for $10,000.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.515
In local high school football...

20:45.760 --> 20:49.230
...who scored four touchdowns
in one game...

20:49.480 --> 20:52.995
...for Polk High School
in the Chicago City Championship?

20:57.480 --> 21:01.393
Excuse me while I kiss the sky.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.037
- AI?
- This proves a personal theory of mine.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.840
The longer you suffer,
the greater the rewards.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.514
That's how the gods work.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.997
Then why won't the gods
let her answer?

21:18.880 --> 21:20.950
Polk High?

21:21.200 --> 21:23.270
Four touchdowns?

21:28.240 --> 21:29.958
Red squeeze buzzer?

21:31.280 --> 21:34.590
Oh, I'm sorry, Kelly.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.835
The correct answer was, audience?

21:41.080 --> 21:44.356
Al Bundy!

21:44.600 --> 21:45.999
You won't go empty-handed...

21:46.200 --> 21:48.475
...we have plenty of
consolation prizes for you...

21:48.680 --> 21:52.070
...and thanks for playing
Touchdown Trivia.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.152
Al?

22:02.440 --> 22:04.237
Yes, Peg.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.949
Am I still getting some?

22:08.360 --> 22:10.112
No, Peg.

22:10.360 --> 22:14.148
In fact, when we get home,
I just might take some back.

22:16.920 --> 22:20.799
Well, it's not 10 grand, but a new TV's
not a bad consolation prize.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.268
So you mean I did good?

22:22.840 --> 22:24.068
No.

22:25.560 --> 22:30.429
Oh, come on, Al.
You're proud of her. Now admit it.

22:31.560 --> 22:36.634
Well, you did your best, pumpkin,
so, yeah, I'm proud of you.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.632
Can we watch something
on the new TV?

22:38.880 --> 22:40.313
Sure, son.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.949
You know,
it doesn't get any better than this.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.430
Who's that ridin' across the plain?

22:47.680 --> 22:49.033
Who's lost count of the wives

22:49.240 --> 22:51.231
- He's slain?
- Slain?

22:51.480 --> 22:55.109
Who is the man who's plum insane?

22:55.320 --> 22:58.551
Pyscho Dad
Psycho Dad

22:58.800 --> 23:02.236
Psycho Dad!

23:03.305 --> 23:09.241
