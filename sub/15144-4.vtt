Caw-caw!

07:10.792 --> 07:15.417
Hey, Bald Eagle

07:10.792 --> 07:15.417
just gave me an idea.

07:15.458 --> 07:18.291
What if we didn't have to suffer

07:15.458 --> 07:18.291
through another concert?

07:18.333 --> 07:19.583
What if we could convince him

07:19.625 --> 07:22.208
to let us borrow

07:19.625 --> 07:22.208
the hot dog cart this weekend?

07:22.250 --> 07:23.709
That's brilliant.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.250
Not only will we have food,

07:25.291 --> 07:28.083
but we can sell hot dogs to

07:25.291 --> 07:28.083
all those other starving people.

07:28.125 --> 07:31.959
And Dad'll be happy because it's

07:28.125 --> 07:31.959
an extracurricular activity.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.125
Dicky, you're a genius.

07:34.166 --> 07:35.750
Genius?

07:35.792 --> 07:38.250
I just thought it would be fun

07:35.792 --> 07:38.250
to ride around the parking lot.
