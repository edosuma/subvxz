00:09.880 --> 00:11.109
<i>Is this really it?</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:16.036
<i>The moment
this can all truly end?</i>

00:16.160 --> 00:18.231
<i>Reverse everything we've done?</i>

00:18.320 --> 00:20.471
<i>Finally bring Five/Nine
to an end?</i>

00:23.280 --> 00:25.670
<i>I fought so hard to protect
the New York facility</i>

00:25.760 --> 00:27.558
<i>that I couldn't see
the bigger picture.</i>

00:27.640 --> 00:31.520
<i>A reported 71 buildings
exploded or caught fire.</i>

00:31.600 --> 00:35.116
You have been
appointed CTO at E Corp.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.840
The CTO title
is nothing more than that.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.673
The position is worthless.
You heard him.

00:39.760 --> 00:40.760
We can use it.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.317
I suppose there's
some banal excuse

00:43.400 --> 00:46.279
why a month isn't enough time
to get my project shipped to the Congo!

00:46.400 --> 00:49.598
Now I want you to imagine
your mom, Trudie...

00:51.080 --> 00:53.993
Am I illustrating my point?
You work for the Dark Army now.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.151
It was you
who exported the keys.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.536
<i>You could make it
like Five/Nine never happened.</i>

00:58.560 --> 01:00.199
<i>Whatever happens after this,</i>

01:00.280 --> 01:01.509
I want us to keep talking.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.875
I want us to be a team.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.595
<i>My associates
found your pet employee.</i>

01:05.680 --> 01:07.034
<i>I am your father.</i>

01:07.120 --> 01:10.079
Angela Moss was allowed
to continue with her lawsuit.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.592
<i>Which put my plans
in jeopardy.</i>

01:12.680 --> 01:13.955
You're panicking
right now.

01:14.040 --> 01:18.353
The minute you remove emotion
from this, you'll do just fine.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.433
<i>You need to talk to Angela.
She is not doing well.</i>

01:21.560 --> 01:24.837
<i>Last time I saw her, she was
going through a full-on breakdown.</i>

01:24.920 --> 01:27.201
<i>The Cyber Bombings,
that was my fault.</i>

01:27.360 --> 01:29.431
<i>She used me for that.</i>

01:29.520 --> 01:33.196
I have to believe
that there was a purpose.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.080
Pettiness.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.392
It was a dig at me.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.759
It's that small,
unfortunately.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.994
No, it's not over.
It's not over. It can't be.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.990
She was gonna
bring my mom back.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.870
We were gonna be reunited.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.800
What are you gonna do to her?

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
What are you asking?

02:25.520 --> 02:29.036
Retribution. I want it.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.750
I'm afraid
your only move here...

02:33.720 --> 02:36.952
Accept that
you've been conned.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.354
Find a way to live
with what you did.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.759
No. You're wrong
about her project.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.239
I know it's possible.
I've seen it.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.996
And I know
how to take it from her.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.433
Don't you get it?

03:04.200 --> 03:05.839
With everything
that we know...

03:06.560 --> 03:08.119
This is what
we have to do.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.640
- Shut up.
- We can expose her.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.256
We can tell everyone
what she showed me.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.476
Shut up! Shut up.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.074
No. I won't.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.994
And if you're not gonna help me,
I'm gonna do it on my own.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.435
And there is nothing you can
do or say to stop me.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.758
I wish
you hadn't said that.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.719
You have to understand...

03:56.640 --> 04:00.554
I have been trying
to stop her from hurting you.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.075
That's why I brought you here.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.799
But you talk like this,
and I cannot protect you.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.234
You have to relent.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.200
There's a chance,
if you beg.

04:17.279 --> 04:20.671
It's the only way out of this.
Please. Please, Angela. Please!

04:20.760 --> 04:21.760
Shh.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.673
You're panicking right now.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.952
Remove all emotion,
and you'll do just fine.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.672
Isn't that
what you're good at?

04:48.320 --> 04:49.879
I'm not gonna run.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.239
So you should
probably leave.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.560
<i>She made her choice.</i>

06:56.800 --> 07:00.840
"Choice"? That's not allowed
when it comes to you. No, no, you...

07:02.240 --> 07:04.197
You did this to her!

07:05.720 --> 07:10.397
You recruited her, and you...
You killed...

07:10.480 --> 07:13.154
<i>And you let it happen,
didn't you?</i>

07:17.360 --> 07:21.149
<i>It wasn't without a valiant attempt
on your part, though,</i>

07:21.240 --> 07:23.232
<i>trying to talk
some sense into her.</i>

07:23.320 --> 07:25.198
<i>It isn't your fault
that she wouldn't listen.</i>

07:25.280 --> 07:27.511
You didn't give me
enough time. She...

07:29.400 --> 07:31.312
She could... She could...

07:31.400 --> 07:33.073
She could've come around.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.911
I meant everything
I said to her.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.516
You are psychotic!

07:38.720 --> 07:42.236
<i>You're certainly not mincing
words today, are you?</i>

07:47.440 --> 07:49.159
It's all psychotic.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.197
<i>Phillip, if you feel
you must take this out on me,</i>

07:53.280 --> 07:55.112
<i>then I'm happy
to bear the burden.</i>

07:55.200 --> 07:58.716
<i>I've become very good at it
over the years, don't you think?</i>

08:07.240 --> 08:09.516
She was my daughter!

08:10.040 --> 08:12.032
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.397
Our team has an update
on the shipment hack

08:20.520 --> 08:22.034
we obtained from Mr. Alderson.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.476
It appears it will grant us the clearance
we need by the end of the year.

08:26.760 --> 08:30.356
It's October now, so that's
two more months we'll have to wait.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.638
Just in time for the holidays.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.600
What is it?

08:46.520 --> 08:51.072
Mr. Alderson is a good-for-nothing
wretch that is not to be trusted.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.516
Oh, Wang Shu,
you needn't worry.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.240
Once our projects ships,
he'll have served his purpose,

08:56.320 --> 08:58.755
and then
he can be terminated.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.312
In the meantime, he needs
to be kept on a short leash

09:02.400 --> 09:05.996
and trained
not to bite his master.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.549
Very well, then.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.636
Send him a reminder
of what's at stake,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.440
should there be
any interference.

09:27.240 --> 09:32.156
I hope you enjoy your last Christmas,
my dear Elliot.

11:10.680 --> 11:14.674
And then she says to me,
"I don't think that's the North Pole."

11:17.160 --> 11:18.640
Freddy,
got a package for you.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.231
And I got a package for you.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.154
That's not funny.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.432
Can we at least
get the Secret Santa going?

11:27.680 --> 11:29.478
It's already 8:00.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.920
Fred.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.272
Come on, we gotta
start wrapping it up.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.920
My babysitter
keeps texting me.

11:43.720 --> 11:44.995
Just a sec.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.397
<i>Oh, that's great.
Can you say it again?</i>

11:56.160 --> 11:57.389
<i>What?</i>

12:00.560 --> 12:02.631
<i>Can you
tell me you like me?</i>

12:04.240 --> 12:05.356
<i>I like you.</i>

12:07.760 --> 12:09.433
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

12:11.960 --> 12:13.519
<i>I love you.</i>

12:15.120 --> 12:19.114
<i>Okay. Maybe... Stand up,</i>

12:19.200 --> 12:21.795
<i>turn around,
and say it again.</i>

12:22.640 --> 12:24.438
<i>You want me to stand up?</i>

12:24.520 --> 12:25.520
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:43.800 --> 12:46.952
<i>How ya doin', Freddy?
Not too good? That's okay, I get it.</i>

12:47.040 --> 12:50.272
<i>Jerking off to underage girls
on live video chats is one thing.</i>

12:50.360 --> 12:53.239
<i>When it's played back, though,
kind of loses its magic.</i>

12:53.320 --> 12:54.993
- Who is this?
<i>- Check your email.</i>

12:55.080 --> 12:57.117
<i>You should've received
a message from me.</i>

12:59.320 --> 13:01.960
<i>I need you to open the email
and click on the link.</i>

13:02.040 --> 13:03.952
You're the one
that sent me the package?

13:04.040 --> 13:06.555
Listen, please don't do this.
Look, I... I can pay.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.479
<i>Open the email
and click on the link, Freddy.</i>

13:11.960 --> 13:15.874
Okay, look, if this is some sort
of a ransomware thing,

13:15.960 --> 13:19.112
or you're trying to
get money out of me, listen...

13:19.200 --> 13:21.157
<i>You obviously don't know me,
because if you did,</i>

13:21.240 --> 13:23.675
<i>you'd already know I don't
give a shit about money.</i>

13:23.760 --> 13:26.355
<i>Do what I'm telling you or
I'm sending the video to the FBI.</i>

13:26.440 --> 13:27.874
Wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait... No!

13:27.960 --> 13:30.680
Fred? I've gotta go.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.793
I'm just
wrapping up in here!

13:32.880 --> 13:35.600
Then you have to ask Trish
to do the Secret Santa

13:35.680 --> 13:37.080
because I need to get home.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.550
Okay. Okay, fine.
Okay, good. Yeah.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.416
<i>Freddy,
I need you to pay attention.</i>

13:41.440 --> 13:43.576
Look, what are you doing in there?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.875
Are you on the phone?

13:44.960 --> 13:48.874
Merry Christmas,
and I'll see you in 2016!

13:49.080 --> 13:51.117
<i>Open the email
and click on the link.</i>

13:51.840 --> 13:54.309
You know, this isn't gonna
get past our IT guys.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.993
<i>That's what I'm counting on.</i>

13:58.120 --> 14:00.476
Okay, I just clicked it.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.669
Are we done?

14:02.760 --> 14:04.831
<i>Get the USB from the envelope.</i>

14:06.480 --> 14:08.870
<i>I left instructions
on how to archive your inbox.</i>

14:08.960 --> 14:11.680
<i>Copy the. PST file
to the thumb drive.</i>

14:12.360 --> 14:13.396
Inbox?

14:14.680 --> 14:16.319
I'm an attorney, pal.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.917
That inbox is full of sensitive
client information! You hear me?

14:25.480 --> 14:26.630
Hello?

14:28.800 --> 14:32.760
<i>I was just taking a moment to think
about whether or not I give a fuck. I don't.</i>

14:39.920 --> 14:42.560
All right, so...

14:42.640 --> 14:44.880
What are you gonna do with my emails
once you do get 'em?

14:44.920 --> 14:47.640
<i>Once you're finished, leave all
your personal effects in your office.</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:51.236
<i>Your phone, your Fitbit, your smartwatch,
anything with an on-off switch,</i>

14:51.320 --> 14:53.551
<i>then bring the USB drive
to Grand Central.</i>

14:53.640 --> 14:55.296
You know, this isn't
just gonna destroy me,

14:55.320 --> 14:57.915
it's gonna destroy the people
that work for me,

14:58.040 --> 15:00.999
my firm, their families,
everyone.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.756
<i>Keep this phone on you.
Expect another call when you get there.</i>

15:06.600 --> 15:08.080
Who the fuck is this?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.432
<i>This is Mr. Robot.</i>

15:38.400 --> 15:39.436
Taxi!

15:51.160 --> 15:53.755
42nd and Lex,
down over Grand Central.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.075
<i>Can you believe that, not long ago,
we were talking about</i>

15:59.160 --> 16:02.232
<i>an economic collapse on par
with the Great Depression.</i>

16:02.320 --> 16:04.960
<i>Especially hard to believe
given the Novemberjobs report</i>

16:05.040 --> 16:06.235
<i>that was released on Friday.</i>

16:06.360 --> 16:08.556
<i>Over 400,000jobs were added.</i>

16:08.640 --> 16:12.759
<i>"This really shows the resilience of
E Corp and their CTO, Tyrell Wellick.</i>

16:13.080 --> 16:17.074
<i>"If it weren't for their data recovery
and their Ecoin loan program,</i>

16:17.160 --> 16:20.551
<i>"we wouldn't be enjoying the turnaround
we're experiencing right now."</i>

16:20.640 --> 16:22.552
<i>A quote from the Chair
of the Federal Reserve</i>

16:22.640 --> 16:24.154
<i>seems to echo public opinion.</i>

16:24.240 --> 16:27.233
<i>Sometimes, the good guys
really do come out on top.</i>

16:31.240 --> 16:32.469
All right.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.959
- Hey.
<i>- Walk to the furthest kiosk.</i>

17:17.079 --> 17:18.309
<i>Get in line.</i>

17:26.880 --> 17:27.880
<i>Okay.</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:31.877
<i>I'm here. I'm in line.</i>

17:37.360 --> 17:40.000
Don't get freaked out,
you're being tailed.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.873
What? Why?

17:42.160 --> 17:43.560
They wanna know
who you're meeting.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.679
<i>I'll take care of them.</i>

17:48.240 --> 17:49.640
<i>- Right now...</i>
- Okay.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.400
I need you to stop looking around like
you're a coked-up Henry Hill.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.957
I actually did some.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.190
- What?
- Some blow, you know? Uh...

18:00.840 --> 18:02.672
Some of the girls had some
at the party and I,

18:02.760 --> 18:03.816
you know...
The Christmas party...

18:03.840 --> 18:05.354
<i>- A little or a lot?</i>
- What?

18:05.480 --> 18:08.040
How much did you do,
a little or a lot?

18:08.120 --> 18:09.120
Shit, man, I don't know.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.351
Right now, it seems like
a fucking lot, okay?

18:12.320 --> 18:14.789
Take a breath, Freddy.
We're gonna get through this.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.274
Wait a second.
Where are you, anyway?

18:21.360 --> 18:23.875
As far as you're concerned,
I'm everywhere.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.633
What does that even mean?

18:25.720 --> 18:28.838
It means
I own the entire station.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.280
Buy a ticket home.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.591
No! I don't want these guys
to know where I live!

18:43.680 --> 18:46.354
Trust me, Freddy,
they already know.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.030
Hi, um, I'd like the first train
to Brewster, please.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.356
Okay, I got it.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.080
All right. You're gonna
head to the train,

18:57.120 --> 18:58.554
but we're gonna
take the long way.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.077
I want you to walk past the clock,
and go towards the Hudson News.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.439
Take out all your cash, give it
to the guy in the Santa hat.

19:14.760 --> 19:15.830
Why?

19:19.400 --> 19:20.959
We've gotta buy time.

19:21.040 --> 19:25.000
Fold it into a ball, make a fist,
toss it in the case.

19:29.840 --> 19:33.959
Don't stop, keep going.
Make a right, and head to the tracks.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.357
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, that's my money!

19:41.080 --> 19:43.675
<i>Track 19,
last car on the right.</i>

19:45.000 --> 19:47.435
So, you have
been following me, haven't you?

19:48.040 --> 19:50.999
<i>- No. I've been waiting...</i>
- ...for you on the train.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.798
Who the fuck are you?

20:18.080 --> 20:20.117
Thought I answered
that already.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.397
Don't think you need
the phone anymore.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.593
Sit down
and give me the drive.

20:36.280 --> 20:40.160
Yeah, first, you're gonna give me
all the copies of that video you have.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.270
You're gonna shoot me
in front of all these people?

20:52.720 --> 20:54.951
Put the gun away, Freddy,
and sit down.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.158
I'm serious. I'm not afraid
to use this if I have to.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.638
And then that video will not
only be automatically sent to the FBI,

21:02.720 --> 21:04.200
but to your wife and kids.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.718
Is that something
you're afraid of?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.713
Sit down,
give me the drive.

21:25.920 --> 21:29.436
So, we're square, right?
You're gonna erase that video?

21:31.200 --> 21:32.520
I mean,
it goes without saying,

21:32.600 --> 21:35.115
I can't have
anyone seeing that.

21:35.680 --> 21:38.673
Look, I'll tell you what.
You keep that drive.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.320
That'll show you
how much I trust you, huh?

21:41.400 --> 21:42.400
You understand me, man?

21:42.480 --> 21:44.073
I'm trusting
that your word is good.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.634
I'm gonna
head on back to the office.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.030
Sit down. We're not done.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.953
Do you know
who those guys were,

21:58.040 --> 21:59.997
the ones
who were following me?

22:01.200 --> 22:02.839
Dark Army.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.514
Jesus Christ!

22:05.600 --> 22:08.274
What the fuck were those guys
doing following me?

22:08.360 --> 22:09.936
They wanna know who
you're giving these files to.

22:09.960 --> 22:10.960
Why?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.316
Because they're protecting
one of your clients.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.400
What client?

22:15.120 --> 22:16.713
Whiterose.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.076
What the fuck are you talking
about, man? Who's that?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.435
You know her as Zhi Zhang,

22:20.520 --> 22:22.955
the Chinese Minister
of State Security.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.096
He and his partners have been
using shell corporations

22:25.120 --> 22:26.634
to move money around,

22:26.720 --> 22:29.872
and your name keeps popping up
on all their company filings.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.919
Oh, shit.
That's what this is about?

22:34.960 --> 22:36.713
Oh, I'm a dead man.

22:36.800 --> 22:37.800
I need to know

22:37.880 --> 22:39.296
how you've been
helping them funnel money.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.279
No, no, no, no, no. You don't
wanna fuck with these guys.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.073
If half the shit
that I've seen is real,

22:46.160 --> 22:48.755
then these guys are
the official fucking bogeyman!

22:48.840 --> 22:51.674
And I'm not talking conspiracy
bullshit either, man.

22:52.280 --> 22:54.272
I mean,
these guys are pure evil!

22:54.840 --> 22:57.230
I am kind of ahead of you
on that point.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.592
Cyprus National Bank.

23:05.840 --> 23:06.956
That's it.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.511
That's their bank.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.678
Tell me what
you know about it.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.354
Look, I don't know shit, man.
Okay?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.671
The reason they even
hire peons like me

23:21.760 --> 23:23.376
is because I'm willing
to look the other way

23:23.400 --> 23:25.357
and push the right papers
for 'em.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.511
Small stuff,
incorporation documents.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.840
Look at me,
I'm a dumb shit.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.296
You think they're
gonna tell me anything?

23:44.640 --> 23:47.792
I may have a contact
in the city.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.080
Who?

23:57.120 --> 24:00.431
Stop fucking around, man.
We don't have a lot of time.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.874
Give me the name.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.714
John Garcin.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.440
Where can I find him?

24:07.880 --> 24:10.520
I don't have
the address on me, I...

24:10.600 --> 24:12.910
I gotta go back
to my office.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.595
I told you to leave
all your electronics.

24:24.920 --> 24:25.956
I did!

24:26.040 --> 24:27.838
I don't have anything on me.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.274
Look, I have nothing.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.039
Go straight to the 42nd Street
exit and wait for my call.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.474
Don't stop, don't turn around.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.472
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're leaving me?

24:48.560 --> 24:51.314
If they see us together,
we're both dead.

24:53.880 --> 24:54.996
Go.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.030
Come on.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.830
Meet me at the corner
of 42nd and Vanderbilt.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.559
Okay. Then what?

25:53.200 --> 25:54.793
I still need Garcin's address.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.471
Oh, no.
You gotta be fucking crazy.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.896
I'm not going back to my office,
those guys are gonna be looking for me...

25:59.920 --> 26:01.434
Let me worry about that.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.070
Listen, I want your word that
if I give you what you want,

26:05.160 --> 26:06.594
you're gonna
destroy that video.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.717
You are in no position
to negotiate right now.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
Just fucking move.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.195
Then I want your word!

26:11.280 --> 26:13.216
If we don't get out of here,
I'm not gonna be the one

26:13.240 --> 26:15.038
you need to worry about.
You understand?

26:15.120 --> 26:16.873
I am your only way
out of this.

26:16.960 --> 26:20.351
<i>And just how the fuck are you gonna
protect me against the Dark Army, huh?</i>

26:20.440 --> 26:22.016
Those guys just saw me
running away from them.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.838
They know
that I'm up to something!

26:31.640 --> 26:32.710
Oh.

26:33.840 --> 26:39.120
You can't protect me,
can you?

26:44.720 --> 26:45.836
Freddy...

26:47.480 --> 26:52.191
Jesus Christ. You don't give
a shit what happens to me!

26:54.000 --> 26:56.037
Freddy, we don't
have time for this.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.353
You need to snap out of it!

26:59.360 --> 27:01.317
<i>They are still coming
for you, man.</i>

27:01.760 --> 27:04.400
<i>You need to make it to
this fucking corner right now!</i>

27:05.640 --> 27:07.040
<i>Right now, Freddy.</i>

27:09.640 --> 27:11.120
Freddy, you need
to keep moving.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.556
Hello?

27:15.920 --> 27:18.594
Just don't send that video
to my kids.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.160
Freddy!

27:27.520 --> 27:28.590
Freddy?

27:38.840 --> 27:40.069
Excuse me. Excuse me.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.913
We need room here.
We need room.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.680
Taking pictures right now, lady?
What are you gonna do with them? Come on.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.112
Put it down. Back up!

27:49.720 --> 27:52.280
Paramedics are coming.
They need space. Make a hole.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.256
Today is gonna be
another busy one

28:06.280 --> 28:07.936
because of the Cyber Bombings
Memorial brunch.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.640
The board of directors would like you
to do some PR interviews today

28:10.720 --> 28:11.836
before you head upstairs.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
Our media consultant

28:13.040 --> 28:14.696
is going to debrief you
with some talking points

28:14.720 --> 28:15.720
back in the green room

28:15.800 --> 28:17.712
before we put you
into hair and makeup.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.752
You have about five minutes
before your meeting

28:19.840 --> 28:21.911
with Mr. Milligan
and his team.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.275
Thank you, Elizabeth.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.919
Oh. That's not all.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.390
After that, you have
a meeting with the board.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.680
It's more of a meet-and-greet.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.155
Then, straight into a meeting
with the Ecoin engineering team

28:31.240 --> 28:33.696
to discuss the new rollout,
and tonight the board would like...

28:33.720 --> 28:38.033
Can we just push
any of this until tomorrow?

28:38.120 --> 28:41.511
No, I'm afraid tomorrow's
already full as well.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.679
Can you just give me a minute?

28:46.320 --> 28:47.640
Certainly, sir.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.760
Congratulations.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.956
I've been meaning to tell you
that for a while now,

28:59.040 --> 29:01.236
but I wanted
to give you your space.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.358
Most of us here consider you
a hero for what you did.

30:09.840 --> 30:10.876
Mom?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.070
Dom!

31:02.360 --> 31:03.896
You up yet, hon?

31:03.920 --> 31:06.435
I'm heading out to go mall
walking with Janice,

31:06.520 --> 31:09.558
you know that lovely girl
I met at church a few weeks ago?

31:12.520 --> 31:15.115
I want you to meet her, I think
you two would really hit it off.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.560
Seriously, Dom?

31:18.640 --> 31:21.519
It's almost noon and you're still
in your PJs. What gives?

31:24.120 --> 31:25.554
You all right?

31:26.440 --> 31:27.794
What's he doing here?

31:27.880 --> 31:30.873
I told you last week, I was
renovating the master bathroom.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.834
What's the big deal?

31:37.480 --> 31:38.709
What's the matter
with you?

31:41.280 --> 31:43.556
I thought we agreed
I would vet everyone you hired.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.197
Hon, I thought you were
kidding like you do.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.272
Listen, I'm glad you're up.

31:50.360 --> 31:54.115
I want you to put a load in so you have
something to wear to the bake sale later.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.398
Janice is coming over after
for some macaroni and gravy.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.912
You're just gonna
leave this guy here alone?

32:00.920 --> 32:02.752
He's not alone,
you're here.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.991
This John Garcin practically
posts every shit he takes.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.276
It's gonna take forever to
go through his social media.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.835
I know we have our issues,

32:53.920 --> 32:56.037
but it's these people
that are the real psychos.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.595
I mean, how proud
of your life can you be?

33:01.320 --> 33:03.960
We have his address.
We should just go.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.273
We'll get the info
we need there.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.555
It's too early for that.
We don't know enough.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.996
He's their liaison
at Cyprus National Bank,

33:12.080 --> 33:13.400
he's gotta
have something.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.314
Be that as it may,
we can't just knock on this guy's door

33:17.400 --> 33:19.995
and pretty-please ask him
for his access.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.390
So, we put our heads down,
do the research,

33:22.520 --> 33:24.876
find a way to break him,
same as always.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.993
It took us
two weeks with Freddy.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.151
We can't wait
that long anymore.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.198
We're running out of time.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.791
By next week, Whiterose
will ship her project.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.394
We'll be dead.

33:36.520 --> 33:39.035
I'm not gonna argue that with you.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.992
Freddy could have
saved us a lot of time

33:41.120 --> 33:44.591
if his brains weren't splattered
all over 42nd Street right now.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.551
He had it coming. They all do.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.791
Don't do this
for the wrong reasons.

34:19.880 --> 34:22.600
You're angry...
And I get it.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.795
But your anger is keeping you
from seeing the bigger picture

34:25.880 --> 34:28.440
of why we started this thing.

34:34.400 --> 34:38.518
You told me once, you don't
take down a conglomerate

34:38.600 --> 34:40.512
by shooting them
in the heart...

34:41.239 --> 34:43.152
Because they don't
have hearts.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.514
You were wrong.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.039
We found their heart.

34:56.400 --> 35:00.360
We rob it,
she finally goes down.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.439
What am I not seeing?

35:05.800 --> 35:08.599
This used to be
about saving the world.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.160
You're making it
too personal.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.914
You're making this about
what they did to Angela.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.118
You're letting your feelings
cloud your judgement.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.279
My feelings?

35:21.200 --> 35:23.317
You see what's going on
out there?

35:23.800 --> 35:28.920
People are already forgetting
about Five/Nine, the Cyber Bombings.

35:29.800 --> 35:35.671
They're buying their Ecoin-discounted
stocking stuffers

35:35.760 --> 35:38.514
and Christmas hams,
and they're gonna forget.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.313
And I don't blame them.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.914
They're exhausted.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.074
I'm exhausted.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.398
But we let this go, it'll be
back to business as usual

35:53.480 --> 35:55.199
for Whiterose and her friends.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.352
The more she gets away with this,
the worse this gets.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.391
So, fuck my feelings.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.391
I'm done with
the therapy sessions.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.680
This is all I'm focused on.

36:36.720 --> 36:37.995
It's Darlene.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.992
She says it's about Angela.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.353
Oh, my God,
thanks for calling me back.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.440
Um...

36:50.840 --> 36:52.240
I think I figured it out.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.835
Okay, I am really
onto something.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.719
Just wait until you hear this,
it's kind of a breakthrough.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.029
Where's Flipper?

37:01.400 --> 37:03.392
The landlord took her
for the week.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.517
What, what are you
too busy with?

37:06.520 --> 37:08.512
What's going on, Darlene?
What are you doing here?

37:11.080 --> 37:12.639
I think I saw Angela.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.199
We talked about this already.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.440
Angela's gone.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.399
Are you on something
right now?

37:29.480 --> 37:32.393
Don't make this
about that, okay?

37:33.480 --> 37:38.236
Just listen to me, okay?
I need you to hear this.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.200
I'm listening.

37:41.120 --> 37:45.592
Okay, um... I was walking
by one of those shelters,

37:45.680 --> 37:48.593
and I think I saw her. Okay?

37:48.680 --> 37:51.957
I... I tried to catch up
with her, but it was crowded,

37:52.080 --> 37:53.080
and I lost her.

37:53.160 --> 37:57.074
But... Okay, but this is proof.
Right? This is proof.

37:57.160 --> 37:59.038
Maybe this is why
they never found her body.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.476
- Maybe she's still alive.
- That's not possible.

38:02.040 --> 38:06.831
No, I am telling you, I saw her.
She was on the street.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.639
Same red cart, same bathrobe,

38:08.720 --> 38:10.757
exactly the way we saw her
on that security footage

38:10.840 --> 38:12.256
- before she got into that van.
- Darlene...

38:12.280 --> 38:15.478
Maybe she escaped!
I swear, I saw her.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.153
Maybe if you would
just help me,

38:17.240 --> 38:19.232
we could find her together.
We just need to canvas

38:19.320 --> 38:21.016
- all the homeless shelters...
- This has to stop.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.716
Elliot, we can't give up
on her, okay? We can't.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.954
You did a little
too much coke,

38:27.040 --> 38:28.600
and you saw something
that wasn't there.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.957
I will show you where I saw her,
just come with me!

38:32.080 --> 38:34.720
Look at you, man.
You are so fucked up right now.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.995
Fuck you!

38:36.680 --> 38:39.991
This is exactly what you do
when shit like this happens.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.480
You shut down.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.914
Angela's dead.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.390
Do you understand?

38:45.800 --> 38:46.950
She's fucking dead!

38:53.080 --> 38:54.719
And it's not our fault.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.120
We tried to help her,
remember?

39:00.440 --> 39:02.636
She did this to herself.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.910
You have to
stop feeling guilty.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.357
I'm not the one
that feels guilty.

39:28.720 --> 39:31.519
Why didn't you just show her
the photo Whiterose sent to us?

39:34.480 --> 39:36.836
You mean the one
with Angela's brains blown out?

39:36.920 --> 39:38.718
Yeah, no,
I don't think so.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.952
At least it would have
put her out of her misery.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.593
It would break her heart.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.113
We need to get back to work.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.998
John Garcin should be
our only focus.

40:26.720 --> 40:29.519
<i>I know
we don't usually do this,</i>

40:29.600 --> 40:31.671
<i>but I have to fill you in
if he won't.</i>

40:32.080 --> 40:34.879
<i>That's why you're back,
isn't it? To help?</i>

40:35.800 --> 40:38.190
<i>You gotta be
noticing it then, too.</i>

40:38.800 --> 40:40.678
<i>That he's not talking to you.</i>

40:41.320 --> 40:43.676
<i>He doesn't talk to me
that much, either.</i>

40:44.280 --> 40:46.078
<i>Not since Angela died.</i>

40:47.960 --> 40:50.429
<i>Darlene's right.
He's shutting down.</i>

40:51.280 --> 40:53.749
<i>Compartmentalizing the pain...</i>

40:54.320 --> 40:56.277
<i>Living in the distraction.</i>

40:57.760 --> 40:59.399
<i>Just like the holidays.</i>

41:00.120 --> 41:03.750
<i>The fake Santas.
The plastic trees.</i>

41:05.600 --> 41:07.557
<i>The annoying Christmas carols.</i>

41:10.760 --> 41:12.956
<i>One big
song-and-dance production</i>

41:13.040 --> 41:15.919
<i>to sell ourselves the theater
that everything's jolly,</i>

41:16.440 --> 41:18.033
<i>at least for a moment.</i>

41:19.800 --> 41:23.953
<i>But when it's all over,
Santa's gone back to his shitty day job,</i>

41:24.040 --> 41:26.919
<i>the trees get disassembled
and thrown in a closet,</i>

41:27.000 --> 41:30.072
<i>the music's faded away.
What then?</i>

41:31.080 --> 41:33.197
<i>That's why
you can't go anywhere.</i>

41:33.280 --> 41:36.034
<i>I know he's keeping you away,
but I'll let you in.</i>

41:36.120 --> 41:38.077
<i>Don't think I'm doing it
for you, though.</i>

41:38.160 --> 41:41.119
<i>Let's be clear, I still don't
give a shit about you.</i>

41:41.480 --> 41:42.834
<i>But he does.</i>

41:42.920 --> 41:46.038
This does not feel right to me.
E Corp owns the building.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.595
They own half of Manhattan.
We stick to the plan.

41:53.640 --> 41:56.633
<i>And right now, Elliot needs
you more than he lets on.</i>

41:56.720 --> 42:00.396
<i>Because when that cold,
brutal reality closes in on us,</i>

42:00.480 --> 42:04.190
<i>we're gonna need a friend.
And that's still what you are, right?</i>

42:29.480 --> 42:30.630
Um...

42:31.080 --> 42:35.040
Delivery for John Garcin
in apartment 7C.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.037
Seventh floor,
to the right of the elevator.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.069
Thank you.

43:00.680 --> 43:01.816
If this goes sideways,

43:01.840 --> 43:03.911
we don't have enough information
to break this guy.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.520
We're just
gonna own his Wi-Fi.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.280
That'll grab us whatever we need
without him knowing.

43:14.320 --> 43:17.950
Is it just me, or is this the quietest
building in all of Manhattan?

43:42.840 --> 43:43.840
Hello?

43:45.640 --> 43:46.710
Anybody home?

43:58.720 --> 44:00.996
Let's check things out
before he comes back.

44:02.760 --> 44:06.276
That wasn't the plan. We're only
supposed to own his Wi-Fi.

44:06.960 --> 44:08.758
Are you kidding?
He's not here.

44:08.840 --> 44:12.436
We just got lucky.
Search everything.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.880
Something's not right.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.076
No shit.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.516
What the fuck?
Did you lock the door?

45:03.600 --> 45:07.355
No. Signal's dead in here.

45:08.920 --> 45:10.115
They're jamming it.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.074
Oh, shit!

45:37.200 --> 45:38.350
Phone's dead.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.836
- It's almost as if...
- There is no John Garcin.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.393
Freddy set us up.

45:57.480 --> 46:00.120
It must have been a distress
signal they gave Freddy.

46:05.880 --> 46:07.473
The place is a honeypot.

47:10.800 --> 47:11.836
No!

47:13.240 --> 47:14.640
Let me go!

47:14.720 --> 47:18.270
No! Let me go! Wait! Wait!

47:19.480 --> 47:21.711
Help! Hey!

47:21.800 --> 47:23.029
Help!

47:26.400 --> 47:31.555
So, Father DiMarco spills
his potato salad all over her,

47:31.640 --> 47:33.597
which I actually think
he did on purpose.

47:33.680 --> 47:37.674
Because Sister Merkin has,
you know, those big tatas

47:37.760 --> 47:39.176
underneath all that
black and white...

47:39.200 --> 47:40.200
Ma, come on.

47:40.280 --> 47:43.159
Oh, get over it.
She's a hottie.

47:43.240 --> 47:45.277
I've seen you check her out
once or twice.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.512
Janice, right?
Are you with me?

47:47.760 --> 47:50.355
Sister Merkin is a 10,
am I right?

47:50.680 --> 47:54.276
Uh... She's quite
attractive, yes.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.036
See? Janice agrees.

48:02.320 --> 48:03.640
Oh...

48:04.120 --> 48:06.157
Look at the time,
I gotta get to bed.

48:06.240 --> 48:09.358
I'm seeing Dr. Passante
in the morning for that thing on my neck.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.474
Dom, hon...

48:12.960 --> 48:15.429
Why don't you help Janice
carry out the leftovers?

48:17.000 --> 48:18.719
It's just some macaroni.

48:19.080 --> 48:21.754
Dominique, don't embarrass me.
Go on and help.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.436
Oh...

48:36.960 --> 48:42.080
Uh, my apologies, I forget how frightened
people can be the first time.

48:42.160 --> 48:43.753
I'm a taxidermist.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.438
I wasn't frightened,
just a little unexpected is all.

48:51.600 --> 48:56.356
Taxidermy, huh? Guess you were
into stuffed animals as a kid?

49:00.520 --> 49:02.159
Not particularly, no.

49:06.760 --> 49:10.151
Well, um, it was nice
meeting you, Janice.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.031
And, uh,
I'm sorry about all this.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.030
All what?

49:19.760 --> 49:22.116
I think my mom was
trying to, you know...

49:23.760 --> 49:24.760
Set us up.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.114
Oh, well, I had no...

49:28.200 --> 49:29.839
Oh...

49:31.880 --> 49:34.190
This is terribly awkward.

49:34.880 --> 49:37.634
I... I... I think she might've
gotten the wrong idea.

49:37.720 --> 49:40.235
It's all good. I'm on
a self-imposed time-out anyway.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.320
Okay.

49:41.400 --> 49:44.996
My ma, she's just trying to cheer me up.
She thought this would help.

49:45.080 --> 49:47.879
Yeah, she said you'd been
through kind of a rough patch.

49:48.920 --> 49:49.920
Bet she did.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.320
It's not a big deal.

49:55.400 --> 49:57.736
It's just a promotion at work
has been a lot of stress is all.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.831
Yeah, she said
you haven't been sleeping,

49:59.920 --> 50:01.718
and she told me
about the drinking.

50:03.760 --> 50:06.480
Oh, I hope I'm not
speaking out of school.

50:06.560 --> 50:10.110
I... I just meant to say
I've been there, with work, you know.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.799
Long hours can really burn you out,
especially in my field.

50:16.400 --> 50:19.632
But I'm here to talk, if you want.
Sometimes that can help.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.951
Yeah. Anyway,
I should get to bed.

50:22.080 --> 50:23.150
Good night, Janice.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.956
Yeah, it's a good idea.
You need your rest.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.296
After all,
you have that interview

50:27.320 --> 50:29.471
about the Santiago case
in the morning.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Excuse me?

50:41.440 --> 50:44.319
You've put it off for weeks.
It's starting to look suspicious.

50:50.600 --> 50:51.795
What did you say?

50:52.120 --> 50:54.351
I was just
explaining that...

50:54.440 --> 50:57.478
Unless you go to work tomorrow
and finish cleaning up Santiago's mess,

50:57.560 --> 51:02.157
then I'm gonna be forced to do something
very bad to your mother,

51:03.600 --> 51:05.796
like, really bad,
you know?

51:07.640 --> 51:10.872
Like, I'm probably gonna have
to slit her from mouth to cunt.

51:16.200 --> 51:20.911
You touch my mom, I will strangle
you to death. You understand me?

51:27.000 --> 51:29.037
You can strangle me
till the cows come home.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.712
That's not gonna stop
the rest of 'em.

51:44.360 --> 51:46.591
Now, you get that rest
we talked about.

51:47.320 --> 51:48.549
You got a big day tomorrow.

51:49.400 --> 51:52.120
Oh, and, would you thank your mom
for me for the macaroni?

52:07.680 --> 52:09.751
Real life, yo.

52:09.840 --> 52:11.680
I'm just saying,
the skullduggery of scientists

52:11.760 --> 52:14.400
led us to this point
in believing this bullshit.

52:14.480 --> 52:15.834
What bullshit, exactly?

52:15.920 --> 52:18.719
That the Earth is a sphere
when it so clearly is flat.

52:20.880 --> 52:23.395
See, you ain't even
willing to question it.

52:23.480 --> 52:25.836
- That's how they get you.
- If the Earth's flat,

52:25.920 --> 52:28.879
then how come no one's ever
fallen off the side?

52:28.960 --> 52:31.111
Easy answer.
Antarctica.

52:31.480 --> 52:34.917
Whoever lives here
has to be fucking mental.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.391
Dar.

52:38.480 --> 52:40.153
What's up?
I just got here.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.232
Please tell me you have
something stronger.

52:46.240 --> 52:49.233
- Stronger than what?
- Anything I've already taken.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.553
That's what's up.
I got you.

52:53.880 --> 52:57.396
Shit, girl, you didn't even
let me tell you what it was.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.816
Why the fuck is
someone in Angela's bedroom?

52:59.840 --> 53:01.069
Who's Angela?

53:01.680 --> 53:07.756
Mmm! Prada, YSL,
Chloé, ballet shoes...

53:07.840 --> 53:11.800
And a bunch of fish food,
with no fucking fish.

53:11.880 --> 53:14.759
Smells like some <i>American Psycho</i>
shit's going on here.

53:15.040 --> 53:16.713
Get the fuck out of here,

53:16.800 --> 53:19.190
you fucking
Mary Poppins whore!

53:19.680 --> 53:21.114
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

53:21.240 --> 53:24.153
- What the fuck did you give me?
- Babe, you need to chill.

53:24.240 --> 53:25.799
- Fuck you.
- What?

53:26.400 --> 53:29.074
Get out. Get out.

53:29.600 --> 53:31.990
Get the fuck out
right now!

53:32.760 --> 53:34.479
Everybody, out!

53:35.320 --> 53:37.630
Out! Get the fuck out!

53:39.720 --> 53:44.511
Go! Get the fuck out!

53:45.000 --> 53:46.719
Get the fuck out!

54:52.640 --> 54:53.790
Is she listening?

54:55.680 --> 54:57.273
Of course she is.
She always is.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.871
Was that her
in the SUV outside?

55:01.160 --> 55:02.913
You tell her
if she goes through with this,

55:03.000 --> 55:04.229
my shipping hack goes public.

55:04.360 --> 55:05.635
She won't be able
to move shit.

55:08.520 --> 55:11.672
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second. Listen to me.

55:11.960 --> 55:15.032
The people you work for,
they're terrorists.

55:15.120 --> 55:17.157
They don't care about you
or any of us.

55:17.960 --> 55:20.400
I know you don't want to do this.
You're just getting paid to.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.595
Please,
I can't leave like this.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.919
I've hurt so many people.

55:31.440 --> 55:32.920
I have to make this right.

55:40.280 --> 55:41.953
Wait. Wait!

55:43.400 --> 55:44.470
No.

55:45.200 --> 55:47.874
You tell her...
If I die, this won't be over.

55:48.440 --> 55:50.750
I know all about
Cyprus National Bank.

55:52.920 --> 55:54.639
Her money's as good as gone.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.199
Even if I die...

55:58.280 --> 56:00.511
She's gonna pay
for what she's done!

56:05.080 --> 56:06.309
Do you hear me?

56:07.080 --> 56:11.233
You tell that piece of shit
that my anger won't die with me,

56:11.320 --> 56:14.040
and she can't hide
from what's coming for her!

56:14.720 --> 56:15.756
You hear me?

56:16.600 --> 56:17.636
You hear me?

56:19.520 --> 56:20.840
Do you hear me?

56:27.480 --> 56:28.596
Say something.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.789
Goodbye, friend.

58:21.160 --> 58:22.719
<i>He got too reckless.</i>

58:25.760 --> 58:27.194
Your job was to control him.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.280
My job
was to protect him.

58:29.400 --> 58:31.437
Your job was to
protect all of us.

58:31.760 --> 58:32.955
What's gonna happen?

58:35.480 --> 58:38.040
The inevitable.
We're all gonna go away.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.751
I just didn't think
it was gonna be like this.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.910
Hmm.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.675
Welcome back, Mr. Alderson.
