00:03.969 --> 00:06.506
<i>* When I wake up</i>
<i>in the morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.539 --> 00:09.376
<i>* I don't think I'll ever</i>

00:09.409 --> 00:12.312

00:12.345 --> 00:15.715

01:20.580 --> 01:23.583
It's 9:00.
Where's Carosi?

01:23.616 --> 01:25.251
Right here!

01:25.285 --> 01:28.521
Line up, you second-rate
excuses for a summer staff!

01:28.555 --> 01:30.623
Line up! Line up!

01:30.657 --> 01:33.159
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:35.261 --> 01:38.465
- Hey,
boss, how about a raise?
- All: Yeah!

01:38.498 --> 01:42.469
Ah, shut up! I'm too cheap
to give myself a raise!

01:42.502 --> 01:46.239
Straighten up.
Yeah, that's better.

01:48.508 --> 01:51.378
Screech, stop making
those goofy faces

01:51.411 --> 01:53.680
or I'll sell
you as shark bait!

01:53.713 --> 01:56.416
- That's not a bad idea.
- Mr. Cannoli!

01:56.449 --> 01:58.351
- Carosi!
- Right.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.820
I was just trying to loosen up
the employees, sir.

02:00.854 --> 02:04.791
What he means is,
a happy staff is
a snappy staff!

02:05.759 --> 02:08.695
Get in line.

02:08.728 --> 02:11.431
All right, staff, I'll be away
all day on business.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.867
Stacy will be in charge
in my absence.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.103
I expect you to show her
the same respect you show me.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.106
Why?
We like Stacy.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.208
We have a full day's
activities scheduled,

02:22.242 --> 02:26.279
plus the Thornhills'
50th wedding
anniversary tonight.

02:26.312 --> 02:31.284
Now let's get to work!

02:31.317 --> 02:34.754
Stacy, keep your eye
on this character.

02:34.788 --> 02:39.325
Don't worry, Daddy.
I'll give him a lot of close,
personal attention.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.931
( chattering )

02:47.400 --> 02:50.370
Lisa, you're tying up
the main line.

02:50.403 --> 02:53.506
Look, Carosi's gone,
you can't get in trouble.

02:53.540 --> 02:57.210
So why don't you be a good
Mother Superior and bug off?

02:57.243 --> 02:59.612
Slater, go for a long one.

02:59.646 --> 03:02.349
( glass shatters )

03:04.317 --> 03:07.787
From whose check do I deduct
the cost of that window?

03:07.821 --> 03:11.257
- Slater's,
he should've had it!
- Look, everyone,

03:11.291 --> 03:13.893
I know when the cat's away,
the mice will play.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.296
But we've still got
a club to run. Get it?

03:16.329 --> 03:19.299
Yeah, all right.

03:19.332 --> 03:23.236
Ms. Turtle,
we'll be billing that call
to your parents' cabana.

03:23.269 --> 03:26.206
How dare you call me collect?

03:29.242 --> 03:32.645
Ms. Carosi?

03:32.679 --> 03:35.648
I'm ready for my close,
personal attention.

03:35.682 --> 03:38.918
Not during working hours.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.654
- Hello, Stacy.
- Hi, Mr. Richter.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.623
- Know who this is?
- Your wife?

03:43.656 --> 03:46.359
My, she's looking
younger every day!

03:46.393 --> 03:50.263
No,
that's my daughter, Jenny...
before she discovered boys.

03:50.296 --> 03:53.867
I'd like you to hang it up
in the dining room for
her Sweet 16 party tonight.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.670
Sweet 16 party tonight?

03:56.703 --> 03:58.538
One moment, please.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.910
Stacy,
I thought the Thornhills'
50th anniversary was tonight.

04:03.943 --> 04:06.212
So did I!

04:06.246 --> 04:08.615
Oh no!
Daddy double-booked the room!

04:08.648 --> 04:10.784
Stay cool.
Mr. Richter's not a bad guy.

04:10.817 --> 04:13.319
Maybe you can ask him
to switch to tomorrow.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.788
I'll try.

04:14.821 --> 04:17.690
Mr. Richter,
I have a proposal for you.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.528
Too late! Mrs. Richter's
already snatched me up!

04:23.396 --> 04:26.800
Mr. Richter, you are
our funniest member!

04:26.833 --> 04:29.536
Now, I know you are primed
for the party tonight...

04:29.569 --> 04:32.405
Primed? I'm flying in people
from all over the world!

04:32.439 --> 04:36.242
I've worn a hole
in my Visa card.
So, what's your proposal?

04:37.243 --> 04:40.380
Proposal?

04:40.413 --> 04:43.316
I propose we hang this picture
right over the head table.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.385
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.722
- I'm dead.
- Maybe not. Maybe...

04:48.755 --> 04:52.292
Got it! Maybe we can
move the other party.

04:58.098 --> 05:02.802
Mr. Thornhill, I'm worried
that your party is going to
be very expensive.

05:02.836 --> 05:07.240
Don't mention money.
Herbert doesn't have
his heart medicine.

05:07.273 --> 05:10.944
See, if you have your party
tomorrow night,

05:11.044 --> 05:13.446
you could take advantage

05:13.480 --> 05:17.183
of our Fourth Sunday
of the Summer Sale!

05:17.217 --> 05:19.519
- 10% off!
- Who cares?

05:19.552 --> 05:21.654
For 50 years I've been
watching every penny,

05:21.688 --> 05:24.691
for once,
I'm gonna splurge!

05:24.724 --> 05:27.894
Besides, our anniversary
is today.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.796
Yeah, but what's
one more day?

05:29.829 --> 05:32.565
Son, at my age,
one day could be everything.

05:32.599 --> 05:36.636
I could kick off tomorrow
during my tango lesson!

05:40.807 --> 05:44.277
- Now I'm really up a creek.
- Oh no, you're not.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.579
We'll have to convince
Mr. Richter to move.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.982
But he's got
relatives flying in
and everything.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.584
Not the date.
The location.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.353
- ( beeping )
- Excuse me!

05:53.386 --> 05:55.822
- Excuse me, please.
- Screech, what is that thing?

05:55.855 --> 05:59.693
A metal detector.
I bet there's a lot of buried
treasures on this beach.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.594
I could be a rich man.

06:01.628 --> 06:04.397
Yeah, you can
also be an idiot.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.568
Well,
no pieces of eight for you!

06:08.601 --> 06:11.037
Whatever a piece of eight is.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.340
( steady beeping )

06:14.941 --> 06:17.277
( beeping accelerates )

06:18.745 --> 06:20.780
( frantic beeps )

06:22.749 --> 06:24.751
( snoring )

06:34.060 --> 06:36.296
( steady beeping )

06:41.067 --> 06:43.937
Will you stop the beep,
creep?!

06:43.970 --> 06:46.072
This is a metal detector,
Lisa.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.976
I'm looking for treasure.
There must be some here.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.880
Screech, I'm wearing jewelry
and I'm sitting
in a metal chair.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.417
It's coming
from underneath you.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.025
Look, a gold coin!

07:05.058 --> 07:07.460
It's probably filled
with chocolate.

07:07.494 --> 07:10.597
No, Lisa,
this is the real thing.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.033
Screech, what are you doing?

07:13.033 --> 07:16.436
You can't have it! It's mine.
Go away! Go away!

07:16.469 --> 07:19.039
I don't want my beach
filled with holes.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.641
Okay, Kelly, sure.

07:24.377 --> 07:28.348
Don't let her fool you, Lisa.
She's trying to
horn in on our claim.

07:28.381 --> 07:32.052
Here, use this coin to start
our children's college fund.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.788
I'm off to find the rest
of our fortune.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.591
Okay, go ahead.
I'm right behind you.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.663
- Hello, Mr. Richter.
- Stacy.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.066
Hi, Jenny. As soon
as the crowd clears out,

07:46.066 --> 07:48.702
we'll start setting up
for the Sweet 16 party.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.905
- Hi, Jenny.
- ( gasps )

07:53.073 --> 07:56.409
A Sweet 16 party indoors...

07:56.443 --> 07:58.878
sounds like
your parents' idea to me.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.715
Jenny, what you want
is moonlight,

08:01.748 --> 08:03.583
stars.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.819
- Romance.
- ( whimpers )

08:05.852 --> 08:09.022
Daddy, I want my party
outside on the beach.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.458
But all the arrangements
have been made.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.627
You know, because you're
such valued club members,

08:14.661 --> 08:17.497
I think we could move
the party outdoors.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.800
- lf that's what
Jenny really wants.
- Oh I want! I want! I want!

08:20.834 --> 08:23.636
You got! You got!
Just stop whining!

08:23.670 --> 08:26.439
That's why we didn't invite
your mother.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.311
- Hey, you were great!
- So were you!

08:31.344 --> 08:34.581
It'll take some work, but now
we can pull off
both parties at once.

08:34.614 --> 08:37.951
- Our problems are over.
- ( chef
complaining in Spanish )

08:38.051 --> 08:40.854
Roberto... all right,
I'll tell her, okay?

08:40.886 --> 08:42.856
I'll tell her.

08:42.889 --> 08:46.826
Stacy, Roberto wants me
to speak to you on behalf of
the kitchen staff.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.597
They want to know when
they'll get the raise your
father promised them.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.667
Tell him I don't know
anything about it.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.101
Okay.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.070
Roberto.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.673
( conversing in Spanish )

09:09.749 --> 09:12.886
Okay.
He says they're fed up.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.655
lf they don't
get a raise today,
they go bowling!

09:15.689 --> 09:19.392
Ay, ay, ay. No bowling!
Huelga... we strike.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.361
Ay, ay, ay.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.039
<i>- Tu espanol es algo confuso.</i>
<i>- Gracias.</i>

09:33.073 --> 09:36.209
He says the entire staff
is tired of being exploited.

09:36.242 --> 09:40.847
Jessie, all he said was
you speak lousy Spanish.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.918
Look, I promise
to take this up with my father
as soon as he gets back.

09:44.951 --> 09:47.287
You promise?
Why should any
oppressed people

09:47.320 --> 09:50.123
have faith in the promise
of a heartless ruling class?

09:50.156 --> 09:53.093
- Oh Jessie, come off it!
- Zack,
you wouldn't understand.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.861
You live in a world
of privilege.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.597
Yeah, and you live
next door to me.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.800
That's beside the point.
These people want answers now!

10:00.834 --> 10:02.635
No, Slater.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.038
Will Roberto
give Stacy till 5:00
to try to reach her father?

10:05.071 --> 10:09.175
Wait a minute. Direct any
questions for Roberto to me.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.312
Cool it, <i>amigo,</i> I'm on a roll!

10:12.345 --> 10:15.648
3:00, no later.
Or else they'll strike.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.954
You're right. They're trying
to take advantage of me!

10:20.987 --> 10:24.090
lf they think they're gonna
get away with it,
they're wrong.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.159
- All right.
- I'm Stacy Carosi!

10:26.192 --> 10:28.895
Yeah!
Now you're talking.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.867
( steady beeping )

10:33.900 --> 10:36.703
Yoo-hoo, little gold ones!

10:36.736 --> 10:40.073
I know you're
under here somewhere.
Come to Papa!

10:40.106 --> 10:42.242
Lisa:
<i>Screech! Screech!</i>

10:42.275 --> 10:44.344
l gave my jeweler
that gold coin you found,

10:44.377 --> 10:46.646
- and he said it's real!
- I knew it!

10:46.680 --> 10:48.682
We're going to
be millionaires!

10:48.715 --> 10:50.717
We'll have two chauffeurs,
three maids,

10:50.750 --> 10:52.419
and even our own plumber!

10:52.452 --> 10:56.423
Screech,
honey, do you think I could
borrow this metal detector

10:56.456 --> 10:59.159
and give your big muscles
a little break?

10:59.192 --> 11:02.595
- Certainly, my darling.
- Thanks. Hold this.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.231
( frantic beeping )

11:05.265 --> 11:07.767
Dig, baby, dig!

11:08.835 --> 11:10.937
What do you two
think you're doing?!

11:10.970 --> 11:13.873
Back off, Kelly!
You'll have to
earn your own plumber!

11:14.974 --> 11:18.345
There you go.
Right here, right here!

11:18.378 --> 11:21.348
Stop it!
You can't dig up my beach!

11:23.083 --> 11:26.186
No <i>loca</i> Jessie,
no strike.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.721
<i>Si?</i>

11:27.754 --> 11:31.124
- Si.
- All right! Yes!

11:31.157 --> 11:34.094
Hey, guys, listen to this.
They're fed up with Jessie

11:34.094 --> 11:36.930
- and I've convinced them...
- No, you listen to this!

11:36.963 --> 11:39.265
I'm Stacy Carosi,
I'm in charge now,

11:39.299 --> 11:42.235
and I won't be bullied!
There's no raise, no how.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.138
You got that?
No raise!

11:45.171 --> 11:47.273
Okay.
We strike!

11:47.307 --> 11:49.209
We strike.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.381
Nice going, <i>Terminator 3!</i>

11:57.784 --> 12:00.086
- You think I
came on too strong?
- Don't worry.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.055
We figured out a way
to have two parties at once,

12:02.055 --> 12:03.390
we'll figure a way
out of this!

12:03.423 --> 12:06.159
I've been
looking all over for you!

12:06.192 --> 12:08.928
They're destroying my beach!
Come on!

12:27.080 --> 12:29.349
( steady beeping )

12:31.084 --> 12:33.953
Samuel, where do I dig?

12:33.987 --> 12:36.356
Right here, my sweet!

12:40.894 --> 12:44.264
You think Jenny would mind
having her Sweet
16 party in a hole?

12:50.870 --> 12:53.006
Kelly:
Look at this disaster zone.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.108
Lisa: I know.
We dug up the whole beach

12:55.141 --> 12:57.310
and all we found was
one crummy coin!

12:57.344 --> 13:01.781
What will we do tonight?
We can't hold
the Richter party out here.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.917
I don't know.
What if we move it inside?

13:03.950 --> 13:06.920
Oh, good thinking, Zack.
How will we throw two parties

13:06.953 --> 13:09.723
- in the dining
room at the same time?
- We're not.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.058
What if we keep
the Thornhill party at 7:00,

13:12.092 --> 13:15.395
and then move
the old timers out and start
Jenny's party at 8:00?

13:15.428 --> 13:19.733
lf they're anything
like my grandfather, they'll
all be asleep by 8:00 anyway!

13:19.766 --> 13:22.302
- I don't know if it'll work.
- It's worth a shot.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.436
We'll just hurry things along.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.972
You're forgetting one problem.

13:26.072 --> 13:30.677
The kitchen staff is still
on strike. Who's gonna cook
for these parties?

13:32.712 --> 13:35.081
All right, who knows
how to make what?

13:35.081 --> 13:38.385
- I make scrambled eggs.
- I can make hot dogs.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.421
All I can make
are reservations.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.090
We'll have to do
a lot better than that!

13:44.090 --> 13:48.762
Here are the menus
for the parties tonight.

13:48.795 --> 13:52.165
All right.
Look, guys, if rack of lamb
is what they're expecting,

13:52.198 --> 13:54.901
then rack of lamb is
what they're gonna get!

13:54.934 --> 13:58.004
How do you make a Bavarian
chocolate cream cake?

13:58.104 --> 14:00.940
With Bavarian chocolate!
Duh!

15:05.038 --> 15:09.042
All right, we have one hour
to let them eat
and get them out.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.111
Let's go!

15:16.383 --> 15:19.386
All right!
Soup! Soup!

15:28.962 --> 15:31.197
All right!

15:37.437 --> 15:40.807
Why fill up on the soup?
Check out our main course.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.776
Main course!

15:49.983 --> 15:53.086
Friends,
on this momentous occasion,

15:53.086 --> 15:55.989
I'd like to say a few words
about my husband.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.259
And you've done it!
Wasn't that beautiful?

16:01.428 --> 16:04.097
And now it's time
for the first dance!

16:04.130 --> 16:06.766
To be immediately followed
by the last dance!

16:06.800 --> 16:08.501
Screech!

16:08.535 --> 16:10.770
( big band music playing )

16:17.043 --> 16:19.512
- How are we doing on time?
- It's almost 8:00.

16:19.546 --> 16:23.483
The Richter party
will be here any minute.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.519
Good evening!
Due to circumstances
beyond our control,

16:26.553 --> 16:30.090
there's been a slight change
in the location of
your beach party.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.459
- It's now indoors,
in the dining room.
- What?!

16:32.492 --> 16:36.062
- What?!
- Once you see
the lovely dining room,

16:36.062 --> 16:40.233
I think you'll be very happy
with the change.

16:40.266 --> 16:43.436
Jessie, these old folks
move like molasses!

16:43.470 --> 16:46.272
Zack says to stall.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.978
You know,
this is the biggest night
in a young girl's life.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.848
I remember my Sweet 16 party,
and why shouldn't I?

16:54.881 --> 16:56.916
- It was just last year.
- That's nice,

16:56.950 --> 16:59.419
but I'm ready for my party!

16:59.452 --> 17:03.289
Jenny, Jenny, don't be
in such a hurry to grow up.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.892
You want your Sweet 16 party,

17:05.925 --> 17:07.926
but once it's over, then what?

17:08.028 --> 17:10.497
16 and one day
isn't quite as sweet.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.832
Where does the time go?

17:12.866 --> 17:15.035
What are you babbling about?

17:15.035 --> 17:17.037
Come on, everybody,
the party's in here.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.805
Wait, um...

17:26.179 --> 17:28.915
- ( music stops )
- Kelly: All right!

17:29.916 --> 17:31.217
What are these people
doing here?

17:31.251 --> 17:33.920
Mr. Richter.
Uh... well, they're...

17:33.953 --> 17:37.057
they're
complimentary chaperones!
No extra charge.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.559
What are these teenagers
doing here?

17:39.592 --> 17:41.294
Uh...

17:41.327 --> 17:44.264
they're here to remind you
to stay forever young.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.966
No matter how old you are.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.571
Excuse me.
I got the coats, Zack.

17:51.604 --> 17:55.075
Let's herd the Thornhills out
before the Richters see them!

17:55.108 --> 17:57.110
Oops!

17:58.178 --> 18:01.047
Forget it, Screech.
It's over.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.383
Everyone, I have
a confession to make.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.853
The club goofed and booked
two parties here tonight.

18:06.886 --> 18:10.090
- I'm really very sorry.
- ( crowd grumbling )

18:12.025 --> 18:14.527
The parties are a disaster.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.463
Not necessarily.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.466
These people came
for a good time.
Why don't we give them one?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.267
How?

18:22.435 --> 18:25.171
Ask Mr. Thornhill to dance.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.575
- Come on, go!
- ( tango music playing )

18:28.608 --> 18:33.246
Mr. Thornhill,
would you care
to tango with me?

18:50.363 --> 18:53.900
That looks like a neat dance.
Would you like to try it?

19:06.446 --> 19:09.182
Mrs. Thornhill,
will you do me the honor?

19:20.427 --> 19:23.296
Mr. Richter,
may I have this dance?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.932
I'm still not sure exactly
what's going on here,

19:26.032 --> 19:28.134
but yes, all right.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.919
Jessie:
Mr. Carosi,
please don't go in there!

19:45.952 --> 19:48.121
What the...
we've got the Thornhill party

19:48.154 --> 19:50.657
and the Richter party
going on at the same time!

19:50.690 --> 19:52.058
Daddy?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.061
Stacy, how did
this mess happen?

19:55.095 --> 19:56.963
The dining room
was double booked.

19:57.063 --> 20:00.100
That's outrageous!
Who's the idiot
who double booked the room?

20:00.133 --> 20:03.069
That's easy. You are.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.473
Do the members realize that?

20:10.176 --> 20:13.546
- Well, Carosi, you're back.
- I'm so sorry
things got out of hand

20:13.580 --> 20:18.051
- while I was away.
- Maybe you should
go away more often.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.220
This is turning
into one heck of a party.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.989
Excuse me. Young lady,
you've done a terrific job.

20:23.023 --> 20:25.992
That's why I
left her in charge!

20:28.461 --> 20:31.364
Stacy, this entitles you
to a raise.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.401
Thanks, Daddy, but I'll only
accept it under
one condition...

20:34.434 --> 20:37.037
you give Roberto and
the kitchen staff a raise too.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.506
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Huh-uh. Huh-uh.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.441
Why should I do that?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.543
Because you already
promised it to them.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.746
And because they
saved your butt
by cooking for both parties.

20:46.780 --> 20:50.316
Okay, they get a raise too.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.219
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna take
a walk on the beach

20:53.253 --> 20:55.321
and have myself a good cry.

20:55.355 --> 20:59.292
I hate giving up money.

20:59.325 --> 21:02.228
That was really nice
what you did for
the kitchen staff.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.198
That was really nice what you
did for me... saving my neck.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.667
You're the man
with a million ideas.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.236
Yeah, here's another one.

21:11.171 --> 21:13.340
Let's dance.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.152
Stacy?

21:26.186 --> 21:29.255
Did your father
say he was going to...

21:29.289 --> 21:32.092
- Walk on the beach!
- Both: The holes!

21:34.461 --> 21:36.996
( Carosi screams )

21:47.374 --> 21:48.675
( Instrumental
theme music playing )
