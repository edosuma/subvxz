WEBVTT

00:08.540 --> 00:10.570
(soft clicking)

00:11.710 --> 00:14.480
LOGAN: Honey?
You in here?

00:19.650 --> 00:23.040
Somebody's been a busy
bee this morning.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.990
Oh, eggs <i>and</i> bacon. My favorite.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.530
(exhales) You sleep okay?

00:32.100 --> 00:34.280
Oh, my neck
is killing me.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.550
So much for that
water-filled pillow

00:35.750 --> 00:37.900
my mom sent me for my birthday.

00:38.730 --> 00:40.950
(clicking continues)

00:41.150 --> 00:43.370
(sighs)

00:44.140 --> 00:46.910
I said I was sorry.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.460
Okay, fine.

00:50.660 --> 00:54.630
Tonight, we can watch
whatever you want.

00:54.830 --> 00:56.590
Hmm?

01:00.020 --> 01:01.890
(grunts)

01:07.830 --> 01:09.880
Uh...

01:10.080 --> 01:12.220
(breathing unsteadily)

01:12.420 --> 01:14.600
* *

01:42.730 --> 01:44.380
(elevator bell dings)

01:44.580 --> 01:45.780
I feel incredible.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.990
KNIGHT: That's because
you're dehydrated.

01:48.190 --> 01:49.690
And delirium is a side
effect of dehydration.

01:49.890 --> 01:52.130
(laughs) Just admit it,
you had fun this morning.

01:52.330 --> 01:54.680
Okay, you were a little
too sweaty for me.

01:55.510 --> 01:56.900
Do we even want to know?

01:57.100 --> 01:58.060
Nope.

01:58.260 --> 01:59.500
Oh, relax.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.500
Hot yoga.
Ah.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.200
Yikes. No, I'm with Knight:
too much sweat.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.370
I prefer baked goods.

02:05.570 --> 02:06.810
(gasps)
Anybody?

02:07.010 --> 02:08.670
Triple D's Donuts?
These are always sold out.

02:08.870 --> 02:10.340
How'd you get them?
I didn't.

02:10.540 --> 02:12.250
They're a little too mainstream
for me, but...

02:12.450 --> 02:14.180
I'm coming around.

02:14.380 --> 02:15.580
They were here when we got in.

02:15.780 --> 02:16.780
KASIE:
Aren't these donuts

02:16.980 --> 02:18.320
triple delicious?

02:18.520 --> 02:20.850
I got up at 5:00 a.m.,
waited in line

02:21.050 --> 02:24.960
for over an hour,
but, oh, it was so worth it.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.490
Totally worth it.

02:26.690 --> 02:30.760
And that is item number 29
crossed off my Dream Docket.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.270
Dream Docket?

02:32.470 --> 02:34.000
Oh, it's a list

02:34.200 --> 02:37.170
of a hundred things I have
always dreamed of doing.

02:37.370 --> 02:39.610
Is, uh, "Riding a motorcycle"
on the list?

02:39.810 --> 02:43.180
Good eye. Riding the open road
on two wheels

02:43.380 --> 02:44.680
is number 26 on the list.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.250
Torres, lessons
start on Monday.

02:47.450 --> 02:48.380
Okay.

02:48.580 --> 02:50.550
And Grandmaster McGee,

02:50.750 --> 02:53.190
you could help me with
item number 30 on the list,

02:53.390 --> 02:55.150
"Become a chess prodigy."

02:55.350 --> 02:57.720
Prodigies are usually children.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.530
I could be a late bloomer.
Oh, speaking of blooms,

03:00.730 --> 03:02.560
rumor has it
that you just bought

03:02.760 --> 03:04.060
a <i>Philodendron gloriosum.</i>

03:04.260 --> 03:07.130
I'm gonna need a clipping.
Number 12 on the list.

03:07.330 --> 03:09.500
There are rumors
about my plants?

03:09.700 --> 03:11.770
Oh, and Knight,
we're taking a falconry class

03:11.970 --> 03:13.570
this Sunday,
6:00 a.m.

03:13.770 --> 03:16.020
(whispers):
Don't be late. Ca-caw.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.680
That was weird.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.420
You think maybe there's
something in these donuts?

03:23.620 --> 03:24.420
(phone beeps)

03:24.620 --> 03:26.050
(grunts softly)

03:26.250 --> 03:27.990
Well, we'll have to find out
in the car.

03:28.190 --> 03:30.770
Attempted murder in Waldorf.
Let's roll.

03:33.140 --> 03:36.460
All right, our stabbing
victim is Logan Donohue.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.500
He called 911,
was taken to Walter Reed.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.200
Going into surgery as we speak.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.900
Any idea who stabbed him?

03:42.100 --> 03:45.270
Nope. 911 operator says he was
barely conscious on the call.

03:45.470 --> 03:47.110
Hospital thinks he was stabbed

03:47.310 --> 03:49.710
with a straight-edged instrument
about four inches in length.

03:49.910 --> 03:51.710
I'll take a paring knife
for 500.

03:51.910 --> 03:54.530
Or cooking scissors for three.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.480
You guys don't use them?

03:56.680 --> 03:58.680
They're a game changer.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.750
Anyone heard from the wife?

04:00.950 --> 04:02.220
McGEE:
Lieutenant
Rachel Donohue.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.520
She was not in the house
when the paramedics arrived,

04:04.720 --> 04:06.430
and police have not
been able to reach her.

04:06.630 --> 04:08.090
Where's she stationed?

04:08.290 --> 04:10.500
Joint Base Andrews.
Hasn't reported in yet.

04:10.700 --> 04:11.760
Hmm. Well, I'll take
some blood samples,

04:11.960 --> 04:13.400
and hopefully,
none of it's hers.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.270
All right. Early morning attack.

04:15.470 --> 04:17.270
Nothing appears to be missing.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.000
We looking at a kidnapping here?

04:19.200 --> 04:21.610
More like a domestic dispute
gone wrong.

04:21.810 --> 04:24.840
I got the 4-1-1
on Donohue's wife.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.080
The neighbor saw her drive off
this morning in a hurry.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.650
You got a time?

04:29.850 --> 04:30.950
7:00 a.m. on the dot.

04:31.150 --> 04:32.950
That's right after Logan
called 911.

04:33.150 --> 04:35.220
That means she was in the house
when he was stabbed.

04:35.420 --> 04:36.720
That's not a good look.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.320
Oh, and it gets better.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.730
The neighbor saw the lieutenant
drop this in the trash

04:40.930 --> 04:42.090
as she was leaving.

04:42.290 --> 04:44.230
Cooking scissors.

04:44.430 --> 04:45.430
300 points for Knight.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.230
All right, not a kidnapping,

04:47.430 --> 04:50.240
which means our missing wife
is now our missing suspect.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.610
Probably on the run. Anyone
feeling like it's BOLO time?

04:52.810 --> 04:54.310
McGEE:
I'll talk to
highway patrol,

04:54.510 --> 04:57.010
but, um, you know, she could be
a hundred miles away by now.

04:57.210 --> 04:58.540
OFFICER:
Whoa, whoa, ma'am.
You can't come in here.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.480
RACHEL:
I live here.
Or not.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.780
Hey, hey.
Let me in.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.150
What are you doing in my house?
Relax.

05:04.350 --> 05:05.580
Where is my husband?

05:05.780 --> 05:07.390
PARKER:
The paramedics
took your husband

05:07.590 --> 05:10.770
to the hospital after you, um...

05:13.280 --> 05:14.780
...stabbed him?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.950
After I what?

05:30.190 --> 05:32.380
Logan and I have been married
for almost ten years.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.710
I would never do
anything to hurt him.

05:34.910 --> 05:37.850
We've got your prints
on the assault weapon.

05:38.050 --> 05:39.890
PARKER:
And Logan's blood

05:40.090 --> 05:41.120
on your robe in the bedroom.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.690
And this is a done deal.

05:42.890 --> 05:46.380
And you claim that you don't
remember what happened.

05:47.740 --> 05:48.760
McGEE:
Think maybe

05:48.960 --> 05:50.100
you did stab him.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.230
No.

05:51.430 --> 05:53.700
Except yes, you did.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.270
The only question
now is why.

05:56.470 --> 05:57.800
Uh, for some reason,

05:58.000 --> 05:59.810
juries are keen on motive.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.710
So either you can give us
one now or we can wait

06:01.910 --> 06:03.340
until your husband's
out of surgery.

06:03.540 --> 06:05.680
I already told you,

06:05.880 --> 06:08.210
I don't even remember
getting dressed this morning,

06:08.410 --> 06:10.620
let alone
what happened to Logan.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.020
(grunts)

06:12.220 --> 06:14.470
My head is killing me.

06:16.340 --> 06:18.340
So, what do you remember?

06:20.140 --> 06:21.710
Um...

06:24.150 --> 06:27.200
I got home late
from work last night.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.970
I'm an aviation
maintenance officer.

06:30.170 --> 06:31.540
I'm on base right now,

06:31.740 --> 06:34.540
but normally I'm on a carrier
for half the year.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.210
That must be hard
on your marriage.

06:37.410 --> 06:39.950
We have our problems.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.830
Just like anyone else.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.280
I'm away so much,
and Logan's job at the FDA

06:46.490 --> 06:49.320
keeps him pretty busy
when I am back.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.590
But our marriage is rock-solid.

06:52.790 --> 06:56.190
Okay, so you came
home late from work.

06:56.390 --> 06:58.030
Then what?

06:58.230 --> 07:01.920
I went to bed
around 11:00 p.m.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.290
The next thing I remember, I...

07:06.860 --> 07:11.310
I was in my car
in some parking lot.

07:11.510 --> 07:13.910
I had no idea how I got there.

07:14.110 --> 07:15.980
I got scared.

07:16.180 --> 07:21.240
I drove home and then I found
you standing in my kitchen.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.910
And I saw the blood.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.930
Oh, my God.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.810
(exhales)

07:32.520 --> 07:34.980
What if I did do this?

07:36.280 --> 07:38.270
Have you ever
blacked out before?

07:38.470 --> 07:40.370
No, but I...

07:40.570 --> 07:44.680
I have been having
some weird health issues lately.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.750
Describe "weird."

07:46.950 --> 07:48.310
Bad headaches,

07:48.510 --> 07:52.320
my skin gets cold and clammy
and I feel like I'm gonna faint.

07:52.520 --> 07:56.490
Google says it may be
an anxiety disorder.

07:56.690 --> 07:58.520
Have you seen a real doctor?

07:58.720 --> 08:02.230
Yeah, just a few days ago,
actually.

08:02.430 --> 08:05.000
We talked and he ran
a bunch of tests.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.830
(scoffs) He told me
to come back next week.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.450
You mind if we have
a chat with him?

08:13.790 --> 08:17.860
I didn't really stab
my husband, did I?

08:18.630 --> 08:21.580
TORRES:
<i>Come on, man. She's using us</i>
<i>to build an insanity plea.</i>

08:21.780 --> 08:24.180
I don't know. The lieutenant
seemed pretty rattled.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.280
Maybe the memory
loss is from PTS

08:26.480 --> 08:27.850
or some trauma we
don't know about.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.890
I don't know, man.
This just smells funny to me.

08:31.090 --> 08:34.910
Especially that, uh,
"weird health issue" thing.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.470
Dr. Marley? NCIS Special
Agents Knight, Torres.

08:40.670 --> 08:41.970
Do you have a moment?

08:42.170 --> 08:44.320
Just a sec.
I'm in the middle of a rally.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.540
Maybe you need to hold
the badge a little higher?
Mmm.

08:47.740 --> 08:49.580
It has to do with
a patient of yours

08:49.780 --> 08:51.460
who was involved
in a stabbing.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.650
Sorry. I've been trying to beat
this yahoo for a month.

08:56.850 --> 09:00.420
Plus, I can't discuss
patient information without...

09:00.620 --> 09:02.840
Without a signed,
uh, HIPAA waiver?

09:05.110 --> 09:06.120
Bada bing.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.930
Lieutenant Donohue.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.730
Yeah, I remember her.
How can I help?

09:11.930 --> 09:13.170
When you examined
the lieutenant,

09:13.370 --> 09:14.570
did you notice
anything unusual?

09:14.770 --> 09:17.040
Any disorders that
could cause blackouts?

09:17.240 --> 09:18.640
Any, uh, violent outbursts?

09:18.840 --> 09:21.810
I ran her blood,
did a standard exam.

09:22.010 --> 09:25.010
She passed with flying colors.
Physically, at least.

09:25.210 --> 09:26.240
What does that mean?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.480
She asked me to run

09:27.680 --> 09:29.280
a full psychological battery
as well.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.980
And her answers were...

09:32.180 --> 09:34.020
inconsistent.

09:34.220 --> 09:35.590
Inconsistent with what?

09:35.790 --> 09:37.360
With any standard diagnosis.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.290
Her responses were
all over the map.

09:39.490 --> 09:43.300
Like, maybe she was trying to,
uh, fake being crazy?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.800
"Crazy" is not
a standard diagnosis.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.950
But now that you mention it,
it might explain things.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.370
McGEE:
Hey, I heard a
rumor you got

09:53.570 --> 09:54.910
the lieutenant's search history.

09:55.110 --> 09:56.340
Find anything helpful?

09:56.540 --> 09:59.240
Sadly, I didn't find "how
to fake an insanity plea,"

09:59.440 --> 10:01.410
if that's the kind of thing
you're asking, but...

10:01.610 --> 10:03.550
I did find a few
odd trinkets.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.880
Was she planning
on taking a trip?

10:06.080 --> 10:09.590
Oh! Actually, that's for me.
Item 62 on my Dream Docket.

10:09.790 --> 10:11.460
"Caribbean cruise."

10:11.660 --> 10:13.730
Like, maybe the cruise
Delilah's mom went on?

10:13.930 --> 10:16.090
The one where she found
a dead body in the sauna?

10:16.290 --> 10:18.110
Maybe not that one.

10:19.050 --> 10:20.800
Kase, you think
you're going overboard

10:21.000 --> 10:22.470
with this whole
Dream Docket thing?

10:22.670 --> 10:23.840
Everything okay?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.300
Oh, I'm fine.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.970
You know,
I just, uh...

10:27.170 --> 10:28.340
It was my New Year's
resolution to finish

10:28.540 --> 10:29.410
the list by the
end of the year.

10:29.610 --> 10:31.110
I'm just getting a late start.

10:31.310 --> 10:34.010
(exhales) So many dreams,
so little time.

10:34.210 --> 10:36.580
What about you, McGee?
What's on your Docket?

10:36.780 --> 10:39.050
Uh, right now?
Finding out what was so "odd"

10:39.250 --> 10:41.390
about Lieutenant Donohue's
search history.

10:41.590 --> 10:43.020
I see what you did there.

10:43.220 --> 10:46.090
Um, her searches were par for
the course this past year.

10:46.290 --> 10:48.630
Tech, travel, fashion.

10:48.830 --> 10:49.960
Then, suddenly, six weeks ago,

10:50.160 --> 10:51.700
she started searching
for things like

10:51.900 --> 10:53.530
"how to tell
if you're going crazy"

10:53.730 --> 10:56.470
and "I feel like
I'm losing my mind."

10:56.670 --> 10:58.170
That's a little on the nose.

10:58.370 --> 11:01.810
Well, maybe that's her plan.
Laying pipe for her defense.

11:02.010 --> 11:04.310
Or maybe she really was
going crazy.

11:04.510 --> 11:06.110
Thankfully, not my department.

11:06.310 --> 11:08.550
But something must have
happened six weeks ago,

11:08.750 --> 11:10.580
because she took a page
from my Dream Docket.

11:10.780 --> 11:13.890
Item 41:
"Go on a spending spree."

11:14.090 --> 11:16.820
She opened a couple new
credit cards and racked up

11:17.020 --> 11:19.260
over $20,000 worth of debt.

11:19.460 --> 11:22.090
$5,000 for a reclaimed
wooden chair?

11:22.290 --> 11:26.500
The Donohues had bigger problems
than a reclaimed wooden chair.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.530
Eh, she says they were
happily married.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.700
Was that before she stabbed him

11:30.900 --> 11:34.310
or after they did nine months
of couples therapy?

11:34.510 --> 11:35.840
Couples therapy?

11:36.040 --> 11:38.180
According to their
bank statements,

11:38.380 --> 11:42.100
they went twice a week,
starting last May.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.720
I don't think it worked.

11:44.920 --> 11:48.840
I told you we had problems,
but we worked through them.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.860
(sighs)
Okay, fine.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.930
Things came to a head
late last year,

11:56.130 --> 11:57.660
but our therapist
is a miracle worker.

11:57.860 --> 12:00.130
Logan and I
have never been better.

12:00.330 --> 12:03.400
Mm. I'm not sure that, uh,
Logan would agree.

12:03.600 --> 12:07.210
Every couple has rough patches.

12:07.410 --> 12:09.540
What was this rough patch about?

12:09.740 --> 12:11.210
Your credit card debt?

12:11.410 --> 12:14.830
Uh, credit card debt?
I don't have any debt.

12:19.330 --> 12:20.550
I didn't...
(scoffs)

12:20.750 --> 12:22.320
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.190
Really?

12:24.390 --> 12:25.720
A $500 air fryer?

12:25.920 --> 12:28.310
Did you see one of those
in my kitchen?

12:29.910 --> 12:31.400
So what do you--
what do you think actually

12:31.600 --> 12:33.330
is happening here?

12:33.530 --> 12:34.670
What's your theory?

12:34.870 --> 12:36.940
(laughs):
That I hatched

12:37.140 --> 12:39.270
some plan six weeks ago
to make myself look crazy

12:39.470 --> 12:41.760
so that I could stab my jerk
husband and plead insanity?

12:43.830 --> 12:45.310
Your "jerk" husband?

12:45.510 --> 12:48.980
How many times do I have to tell
him to pick up his clothes

12:49.180 --> 12:51.120
before he will
listen to me?
You tell us.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.220
Day after day, I have to ask him
to wipe down the table.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.920
He just won't wipe down
the table after he eats!

12:58.120 --> 12:59.930
Night after night...
Sit down, Lieutenant.

13:00.130 --> 13:03.030
...the snoring.
He sets the thermostat too low.

13:03.230 --> 13:04.600
Sit down!
I haven't had
a good night's sleep

13:04.800 --> 13:06.400
in I don't even know...
All right. Sit down!

13:06.600 --> 13:07.730
(gasping)

13:07.930 --> 13:09.120
Lieutenant?
What? What is it? Lieutenant?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.570
I got you.

13:12.770 --> 13:14.790
I got her, I got her.
All right.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.480
RACHEL:
I told you,

13:25.680 --> 13:27.420
I don't need to go
to the hospital.

13:27.620 --> 13:30.020
I feel better now.

13:30.220 --> 13:31.560
Except, uh...

13:31.760 --> 13:33.260
maybe a little hungry.

13:33.460 --> 13:34.590
Okay.

13:34.790 --> 13:36.260
Uh, why don't you
take her upstairs,

13:36.460 --> 13:38.180
get her something to eat?

13:39.780 --> 13:41.530
Thank you.

13:41.730 --> 13:43.250
You're welcome.

13:45.190 --> 13:46.700
(stammers)

13:46.910 --> 13:51.580
Agent Torres told me
what I said earlier and, um,

13:51.780 --> 13:54.110
that wasn't me.

13:54.310 --> 13:57.230
I love my husband.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.510
AGENT:
After you.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.760
She didn't seem like
she loved him in interrogation.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.530
I know. I saw the tape.

14:08.730 --> 14:10.630
And I actually think
I might be able to explain it.

14:10.830 --> 14:12.230
Kasie ran her blood,

14:12.430 --> 14:14.200
and her thyroxine levels
are through the roof.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.600
Thyroxine?

14:15.800 --> 14:17.270
It's a hormone produced
by your thyroid gland.

14:17.470 --> 14:19.140
Also known as T4.

14:19.340 --> 14:21.740
Too much can lead
to headaches and memory loss.

14:21.940 --> 14:23.340
Violent outbursts?

14:23.540 --> 14:25.580
JIMMY:
At the extreme levels
that we found?

14:25.780 --> 14:27.880
Yes.
Are you telling me

14:28.080 --> 14:29.880
that Lieutenant Donohue
stabbed her husband

14:30.080 --> 14:31.780
because her thyroid
is out of whack?

14:31.980 --> 14:34.020
Well, not quite.
We also found a T4 stimulant

14:34.220 --> 14:36.120
in her blood,
and it's not natural.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.920
It's synthetic, like a,
like a pill or an injection.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.760
What, is she taking something?

14:40.960 --> 14:44.400
Well, she says no.
And if that's the case...

14:44.600 --> 14:45.760
Someone's drugging her?

14:45.960 --> 14:47.200
And I think I know how.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.570
She was having trouble
breathing when she came down,

14:48.770 --> 14:49.870
so I took a look at her lungs.

14:50.070 --> 14:53.340
They're clear,
but the X-ray showed me this.

14:53.540 --> 14:56.110
At first, I thought it was
a birth control implant,

14:56.310 --> 14:57.740
but the lieutenant said
she didn't have one.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.810
In fact, she's never had
an implant of any kind.

15:00.010 --> 15:02.310
So how the hell
did it get there?

15:02.510 --> 15:03.680
No clue.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.320
But by the way her T4 spiked

15:05.520 --> 15:08.390
and then went back to normal
so quickly, I suspect

15:08.590 --> 15:10.160
this implant is the cause.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.830
Now, I suggest getting it out
of her immediately,

15:14.030 --> 15:16.210
before something else happens.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.310
RACHEL:
This is the thing
that was in my arm?

15:28.510 --> 15:30.480
And you had no idea
it was there?

15:30.680 --> 15:31.980
No.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.110
How is that
even possible?

15:34.310 --> 15:35.710
We're trying to figure that out.

15:35.910 --> 15:38.480
But our medical
examiner confirmed

15:38.680 --> 15:40.720
it's the source of
your thyroid issues.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.220
And your symptoms.

15:42.420 --> 15:44.160
The blackouts,
the violent behavior.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.920
Why would somebody
do this to me?

15:46.120 --> 15:47.990
We're trying to
figure that out, too.

15:48.190 --> 15:49.230
We're taking the implant apart

15:49.430 --> 15:50.900
and hoping to track down
whoever made it.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.900
You said your symptoms
started six weeks ago.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.730
About that, yeah.

15:55.930 --> 15:58.570
You have any surgical procedures
around that time

15:58.770 --> 16:00.310
where you were sedated?

16:00.510 --> 16:02.240
I had a root canal. Uh...

16:02.440 --> 16:04.010
They put me

16:04.210 --> 16:05.180
in a twilight sleep.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.380
And my...

16:07.580 --> 16:09.480
my arm was sore afterward.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.480
We're gonna need the name
of that dentist.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.590
I have to tell Logan.

16:13.790 --> 16:15.890
He has to know
that this wasn't my fault.

16:16.090 --> 16:18.510
He's still recovering
from surgery.

16:21.540 --> 16:24.160
My family...

16:24.360 --> 16:26.130
we don't talk too much.

16:26.330 --> 16:29.980
Hell, I wasn't even invited to
my cousin's funeral last year.

16:31.750 --> 16:36.720
But Logan,
he's always been my rock.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.980
He thought
he had me beat.
(grunts softly)

16:41.180 --> 16:44.220
But that's when I showed him
a straight flush.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.320
(speaking indistinctly)

16:46.520 --> 16:48.890
(laughs): Exactly.
Didn't know what hit him.

16:49.090 --> 16:50.390
MILA:
Dr. Kimball?

16:50.590 --> 16:51.690
There's some officers

16:51.890 --> 16:54.660
from, um...
Federal agents, actually.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.060
NCIS. We'd like a word with you?

16:57.260 --> 16:58.900
Uh, of-of course.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.830
Uh, Mila, can you finish up?

17:01.030 --> 17:02.070
Mm-hmm.

17:02.270 --> 17:04.300
Uh, now you think about
those veneers, okay?

17:04.500 --> 17:07.040
And remember, floss.
Mm-hmm.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.410
We are, uh, here
about a patient.

17:09.610 --> 17:11.140
Lieutenant Rachel Donohue.

17:11.340 --> 17:13.450
Uh, hmm, doesn't sound familiar.

17:13.650 --> 17:15.510
She had a root canal
about two months ago.

17:15.710 --> 17:18.730
Oh, I-I'd have
to double-check my files.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.560
Why are dentist's offices
so weird?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.760
I don't know, man. I kind of
like the dentist's office.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.100
Yeah, the comfy chair,
the spa music.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.270
You know, senior year,
I discovered I had twice

17:34.470 --> 17:37.640
as many nerve endings in my
mouth as a normal person?

17:37.840 --> 17:39.470
I didn't know you were
so sensitive, McGee.

17:39.670 --> 17:41.390
(loud thud)

17:48.600 --> 17:50.830
Dr. Kimball?
(thud, squeaking)

17:54.570 --> 17:56.220
You keep files on the roof?

17:56.420 --> 17:58.060
Yeah.

17:58.260 --> 17:59.720
McGEE:
Well, looks like
you've got quite

17:59.920 --> 18:01.660
the gambling
problem, Doctor.

18:01.860 --> 18:04.630
Even a few misdemeanors
for bookkeeping.

18:04.830 --> 18:07.670
That was years ago. I-I'm on
the straight and narrow now.

18:07.870 --> 18:10.500
Mm. Says the man
who, uh, just tried to escape.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.900
McGEE:
Let's try this
one more time.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.420
Do you remember
Lieutenant Donohue?

18:17.020 --> 18:20.160
Did you implant something in
her arm while she was sedated?

18:22.060 --> 18:24.550
Okay, look, if you talk,

18:24.750 --> 18:27.050
we'll put in a good word
with the DA. If you don't,

18:27.250 --> 18:30.040
I'm gonna pretend
you're my childhood dentist.

18:30.870 --> 18:32.190
Mm, you don't want that.

18:32.390 --> 18:33.530
Going once...

18:33.730 --> 18:35.330
Going twice.

18:35.530 --> 18:36.760
Okay. Okay, listen.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.400
All I did was give Rachel
a-a simple root canal.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.900
And?

18:42.100 --> 18:46.540
And I gave her an in-injection.

18:46.740 --> 18:48.270
What kind of injection?

18:48.470 --> 18:50.610
(sighs)
I don't know.

18:50.810 --> 18:52.210
I was contacted
over the Internet.

18:52.410 --> 18:55.350
They said all I had to do
was give Rachel this shot.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.380
They promised
it wouldn't hurt her,

18:57.580 --> 18:59.280
a-and that they'd pay my debts.

18:59.480 --> 19:00.590
That must have been some debt,

19:00.790 --> 19:03.390
considering you violated
every oath you took.

19:03.590 --> 19:05.490
I got in deep
last football season

19:05.690 --> 19:06.890
with some really bad dudes.

19:07.090 --> 19:09.590
I-It was either this
or get my legs broken.

19:09.790 --> 19:11.100
How'd they pay you?

19:11.300 --> 19:13.100
They wired me the money.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.500
If I give you some
of the info on these guys,

19:15.700 --> 19:17.270
maybe this could go away?

19:17.470 --> 19:19.040
Your kids need braces?

19:19.240 --> 19:20.990
I could do it
for free.

19:22.660 --> 19:25.110
If you could expedite that,
I would appreciate it.

19:25.310 --> 19:26.780
Thanks.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.980
Let me guess,
the scuba equipment you ordered

19:29.180 --> 19:30.320
is running late?

19:30.520 --> 19:32.150
Uh, no, it's, um...

19:32.350 --> 19:33.820
Mm. It's nothing.

19:34.020 --> 19:36.790
Is that the, uh, last sample
of Lieutenant Donohue's blood?

19:36.990 --> 19:39.320
Mm-hmm. Uh, any luck
tracing the implant?

19:39.520 --> 19:42.230
No, not yet. I've taken
this thing completely apart

19:42.430 --> 19:43.930
and still have no idea
who made it.

19:44.130 --> 19:46.600
Fascinating biotech, though.
Way ahead of its time.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.030
It's made of a polymer

19:49.230 --> 19:50.970
that's safe enough to be
in the body for years.

19:51.170 --> 19:53.370
You put whatever medicine
you want in here.

19:53.570 --> 19:54.870
And it comes out
through this membrane.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.610
And it's programmable,
so you can control

19:56.810 --> 19:58.910
the amount released
with your phone.

19:59.110 --> 20:02.210
That suddenly sounds a lot
less cool and a lot more scary.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.180
Like, "a whole new way for
hackers to kill people" scary.

20:05.380 --> 20:06.780
Or, in this case,

20:06.980 --> 20:10.120
"crank up the dosage enough
to drive you crazy" scary.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.990
I can't believe this was
in her without her knowing,

20:13.190 --> 20:16.810
messing with her hormones,
her memories.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.160
Everything okay?

20:19.360 --> 20:21.030
Hmm? What? Yeah. Why?

20:21.230 --> 20:24.100
Uh, Jess was just telling about
your, uh, your Dream Docket.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.100
The donuts and the motorcycle
lessons, all that stuff.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.940
Made me think that

20:29.140 --> 20:32.640
everything was maybe not okay?

20:32.840 --> 20:34.610
Oh, my God,
because I'm eating donuts

20:34.810 --> 20:36.580
and taking motorcycle lessons?

20:36.780 --> 20:38.780
Also, you've been evading me.
What?

20:38.980 --> 20:40.420
I am totally not evading you.

20:40.620 --> 20:42.020
Yes, you've been evading me.

20:42.220 --> 20:43.390
Kasie, come on, we've been
through too much, all right,

20:43.590 --> 20:45.420
for these kind
of shenanigans.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.940
Is something going on?

20:51.810 --> 20:55.330
My aunt was recently diagnosed

20:55.530 --> 20:57.600
with early-onset Alzheimer's.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.270
Oh, Kase. I'm so sorry.

21:00.470 --> 21:02.740
I got tested a few days ago,

21:02.940 --> 21:06.440
to see if I have
the high-risk gene that, um...

21:06.640 --> 21:08.350
I'm sure you know

21:08.550 --> 21:10.350
all about that. Um...

21:10.550 --> 21:12.580
And I'm waiting
on my test results.

21:12.780 --> 21:14.190
So that is why

21:14.390 --> 21:17.050
you wanted to finish
your Dream Docket.

21:17.250 --> 21:21.360
I thought I had all the time
in the world, but maybe I don't.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.190
Okay, forgive me,
but do you think

21:23.400 --> 21:25.760
maybe you might be
overreacting here?

21:25.960 --> 21:28.070
No, it depends on the results.

21:28.270 --> 21:31.840
Uh, you're right, a-and I know
how hard waiting can be,

21:32.040 --> 21:33.410
but I think
there's no need to panic.

21:33.610 --> 21:35.020
Jimmy.

21:36.060 --> 21:36.940
I am allowed

21:37.140 --> 21:39.540
to freak out however I want to.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.650
Okay? And you don't know
what I'm feeling.

21:42.850 --> 21:44.150
You're right.

21:44.350 --> 21:47.050
I-I don't know exactly
how you're feeling, but...

21:47.250 --> 21:50.020
But you just want to help.
Okay, I get it.

21:50.220 --> 21:51.490
So why don't you help
by letting me

21:51.690 --> 21:54.210
get back to tracing
this implant?

21:57.310 --> 21:58.760
(grunts)

21:58.960 --> 22:01.230
If I hear the word
"proprietary" one more time...

22:01.430 --> 22:03.300
Not getting anywhere
with the biotech companies?

22:03.500 --> 22:05.240
Well, half of them
refused to speak to me,

22:05.440 --> 22:08.270
and the other half accused me
of being the competition.

22:08.470 --> 22:10.240
Well, competitors have been
stealing each other's tech

22:10.440 --> 22:11.410
for centuries.

22:11.610 --> 22:13.350
Lightbulb,
telephone...

22:13.550 --> 22:15.250
<i>Monopoly.</i>

22:15.450 --> 22:18.120
The board game?
Yeah, it used to be called
<i>The Landlord's Game.</i>

22:18.320 --> 22:22.190
It was made to teach people
how terrible capitalism was.

22:22.390 --> 22:23.360
Well, that backfired,

22:23.560 --> 22:24.990
because every capitalist
loves that game.

22:25.190 --> 22:26.920
Not me. Last time I won
at <i>Monopoly,</i> I was nine.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.460
Been chasing that high
ever since.

22:29.660 --> 22:31.900
Any luck tracing that payment
to our dentist?

22:32.100 --> 22:33.970
Uh, the trail dead-ended
at a shell company.

22:34.170 --> 22:35.470
Kasie's working on it.

22:35.670 --> 22:37.840
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to hurt that woman.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.870
Unless we still think
she's playing us somehow?

22:40.070 --> 22:42.810
No. No, the lieutenant
is no longer a suspect.

22:43.010 --> 22:44.310
She was the target.

22:44.510 --> 22:46.140
I might have a lead
on who was targeting her.

22:46.340 --> 22:48.110
I figured someone was
keeping tabs on her

22:48.310 --> 22:50.350
with all that was going on,
so I checked out

22:50.550 --> 22:54.140
the Donohues' doorbell camera
footage, and check it out.

22:57.810 --> 22:58.860
Well, that's creepy.

22:59.060 --> 23:01.590
What's he doing?
He's just staring.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.900
Yeah, he does the exact
same thing the next two nights.

23:04.100 --> 23:05.860
Donohues have a stalker?

23:06.060 --> 23:08.000
Or maybe he had to get closer
in order to adjust

23:08.200 --> 23:09.930
the dosage on that implant.

23:10.130 --> 23:11.540
You get a shot
of his face?

23:11.740 --> 23:12.940
This is as good as it gets.

23:13.140 --> 23:15.640
(phone chimes)
Oh. Kasie has a lead.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.480
She tracked down
a piece of the implant.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.140
It was a patent filed
by a start-up biotech company

23:20.340 --> 23:21.500
in Sterling.

23:22.260 --> 23:24.750
Biotech start-up. I'll take it.

23:24.950 --> 23:27.550
Do I even have to ask
who wants to go with?

23:27.750 --> 23:30.120
BOTH:
McGee.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.720
McGEE:
<i>I read about these</i>
<i>in</i> NanoTech Today.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.730
It's a microfluidic chip

23:35.930 --> 23:36.990
that can run all kinds
of medical tests

23:37.190 --> 23:39.000
from a single drop of blood.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.770
Fool me once. Theranos, anyone?

23:41.970 --> 23:43.400
Whoa.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.820
What's that?

23:46.020 --> 23:48.610
That, gentlemen,
is a human liver.

23:48.810 --> 23:50.440
Or at least the start of one.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.280
I'm Adriana Broussard,

23:52.480 --> 23:54.210
CEO of Dynamical Labs.

23:54.410 --> 23:57.380
Hi. NCIS Special Agent McGee,
this is Special Agent Parker.

23:57.580 --> 24:00.420
That liver took
my Regenerative Medicine Team

24:00.620 --> 24:02.350
eight months to grow.

24:02.550 --> 24:03.760
Does it work?

24:03.960 --> 24:05.290
Is that why you're here?

24:05.490 --> 24:07.160
To discuss
our synthetic organ work?

24:07.360 --> 24:10.560
We're actually here to discuss
something a little smaller.

24:10.760 --> 24:14.900
Hmm. Dynamical Labs actually
thinks big by thinking small.

24:15.100 --> 24:18.840
Our true calling is
microbiomechanical systems.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.610
Such as replacing
these old cochlear implants

24:21.810 --> 24:26.240
with artificial auditory nerves
the thickness of a human hair.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.450
Whew.
The technology behind
it would astound you.

24:29.650 --> 24:30.720
Would you like a tour?

24:30.920 --> 24:33.380
As much as we'd love a tour,

24:33.590 --> 24:35.090
we really need to ask
a few questions.

24:35.290 --> 24:37.050
Of course. Happy to help.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.890
Are you working
on any subdermal,

24:40.090 --> 24:42.060
micro-drug delivery systems?

24:42.260 --> 24:44.730
Yes, but I can't go
into any detail,

24:44.930 --> 24:46.730
as that work
is highly confidential.

24:46.930 --> 24:48.480
Work like this?

24:50.690 --> 24:51.800
Where did you get that?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.970
Pulled it out of a woman's arm.

24:54.170 --> 24:56.010
That's not possible.

24:56.210 --> 24:58.110
That was a prototype
from a program

24:58.310 --> 25:00.440
that was shelved six months ago.

25:00.650 --> 25:02.450
Why was it shelved?

25:02.650 --> 25:04.380
The FDA came out to
do an inspection,

25:04.580 --> 25:07.520
and they felt the
product was too risky.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.390
The FDA?

25:09.590 --> 25:14.160
Do you remember exactly who
from the FDA did the inspection?

25:14.360 --> 25:18.260
The safety officer's name
was Logan Donohue.

25:18.460 --> 25:19.960
PARKER: The
lieutenant's husband.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.870
Funny coincidence.

25:22.070 --> 25:23.170
I'm guessing people
get pretty upset

25:23.370 --> 25:25.070
when their programs
get shut down?

25:25.270 --> 25:28.340
Our engineers devote their lives
to their projects.

25:28.540 --> 25:31.960
Donohue's name is like
a curse word around here now.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.950
What exactly is going on here?

25:36.150 --> 25:38.330
Sounds like payback.

25:45.940 --> 25:49.060
"You ruined my life,
so I'm going to ruin yours."

25:49.260 --> 25:51.960
And this was emailed
to our stabbing victim Logan?

25:52.160 --> 25:54.070
Yeah, we started
digging into his accounts

25:54.270 --> 25:55.770
after our visit to Dynamical.

25:55.970 --> 25:57.100
Yeah, that was sent to Logan

25:57.300 --> 25:59.270
after he got the implant program
shut down.

25:59.470 --> 26:02.770
You suspect that one
of the fired engineers sent it?

26:02.970 --> 26:04.740
Well, according to the CEO
we spoke with,

26:04.940 --> 26:08.780
over 40 engineers lost their
jobs when the program was cut.

26:08.980 --> 26:10.410
I mean, some of them had devoted

26:10.610 --> 26:12.080
their entire professional
careers to it.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.650
But why put the implant
in Lieutenant Donohue?

26:14.850 --> 26:15.990
The guy who wrote this

26:16.190 --> 26:18.520
said he wanted
to ruin Logan's life.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.090
So, any luck tracing that email?

26:20.290 --> 26:22.890
Working on it.
And we're looking over the list

26:23.090 --> 26:25.730
of fired employees,
seeing if anyone stands out.

26:25.930 --> 26:28.530
(phone chimes)
Kasie's still trying to track
the payment to the dentist.

26:28.730 --> 26:31.600
You might want to try
talking to Logan himself.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.000
Yeah, when he wakes up.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.370
He's awake.

26:34.570 --> 26:36.070
That's the
hospital. He's up.

26:36.270 --> 26:37.470
Wants to talk.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.080
All right,
we'll get someone there ASAP.

26:40.280 --> 26:41.350
Right. Just be careful.

26:41.550 --> 26:43.980
Someone wanted to get
revenge on this guy.

26:44.180 --> 26:45.900
They may not be done.

26:50.270 --> 26:53.120
These are the engineers from
the implant team you shut down.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.490
We think that, uh, one of them
sent you that threatening email.

26:56.690 --> 26:58.900
Uh, nobody's standing out.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.870
(sighs)
This is all my fault.

27:02.070 --> 27:03.400
If I didn't shut
that program down,

27:03.600 --> 27:04.800
none of this would
have happened.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.220
You mind if we show you
one more photo?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.540
This guy's been hanging
around your house.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.010
Look familiar?

27:15.210 --> 27:17.550
Yeah, he does, actually.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.050
When I took the trash out
last week,

27:19.250 --> 27:21.750
I-I saw a guy wearing
that exact same hoodie.

27:21.950 --> 27:23.520
Did you get a look at his face?

27:23.720 --> 27:26.990
No, but I-I saw him
drive off in a, um...

27:27.190 --> 27:28.530
a silver Prius.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.710
Thank you, Mr. Donohue.

27:31.810 --> 27:33.730
When can I see my wife?

27:33.930 --> 27:35.100
She wanted to wait
until you asked for her

27:35.300 --> 27:36.230
before she walked in.

27:36.430 --> 27:38.920
(chuckles)
I'm asking.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.890
I'm so sorry, Logan.

27:55.090 --> 27:59.360
Honey, you're not
getting rid of me that easily.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.280
Come here.

28:02.310 --> 28:04.650
Come here.
(exhales)

28:17.960 --> 28:20.240
Ooh. You're a hard man to find.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.450
That was kind of the point.

28:22.650 --> 28:24.120
(laughs)

28:24.320 --> 28:26.220
Office rugs
getting steam-cleaned?

28:26.420 --> 28:30.960
No, I just lately found that
my office is starting to feel

28:31.160 --> 28:34.660
a little too much
like my office.

28:34.860 --> 28:36.660
(chuckles)
Plus, at night,

28:36.860 --> 28:38.360
I can get a lot more work
done down here

28:38.560 --> 28:40.800
without any distractions.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.970
That would be me. Um...

28:43.170 --> 28:46.740
Here is the analysis on
the implant you requested.

28:46.940 --> 28:49.570
Uh, word of warning, it's
not exactly light reading.

28:49.770 --> 28:52.130
I'll keep
my medical dictionary handy.

28:56.330 --> 28:58.580
Is there something else,
Miss Hines?

28:58.780 --> 29:00.180
Actually, there is.

29:00.380 --> 29:03.220
Uh, I apologize for asking,
but I heard that you dealt

29:03.420 --> 29:07.120
with a pretty major health scare
not too long ago.

29:07.320 --> 29:10.610
Totally understand if you don't
want to talk about it.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.250
My doctors thought
I had lymphoma.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.470
Thankfully,

29:18.670 --> 29:21.720
it turned out to be something
that was benign.

29:22.690 --> 29:24.680
But you didn't know that
right away?

29:24.880 --> 29:27.860
No, I most surely did not.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.180
How did you handle it?

29:31.380 --> 29:33.350
Waiting for your results,
not knowing

29:33.550 --> 29:36.490
whether your entire life
was about to change.

29:36.690 --> 29:39.560
Well, um...

29:39.760 --> 29:42.130
it wasn't my finest moment.

29:42.330 --> 29:47.530
I couldn't stop imagining
all the things in life that...

29:47.730 --> 29:49.830
I might miss out on.

29:50.030 --> 29:52.790
Walking my daughter
down the aisle.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.390
Holding my first grandchild.

29:57.260 --> 29:58.480
You must have been
pretty relieved

29:58.680 --> 30:00.080
when you got your results.

30:00.280 --> 30:05.070
Actually, I-I was able
to find peace even before then.

30:06.170 --> 30:10.920
I realized that,
cancer or not,

30:11.120 --> 30:13.590
my future
wasn't a given.

30:13.790 --> 30:17.360
You never know what's waiting
for you down the road.

30:17.560 --> 30:18.860
Ever.

30:19.060 --> 30:20.930
No disrespect,
but that sounds like the tagline

30:21.130 --> 30:22.730
for a horror movie poster.

30:22.930 --> 30:24.870
Or the greatest love story
of all time.

30:25.070 --> 30:26.570
You just never know.

30:26.770 --> 30:29.140
So I just decided

30:29.340 --> 30:32.680
I was gonna live every day
like it's my last.

30:32.880 --> 30:36.230
That way,
I'll never be disappointed.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.220
(exhales)

30:40.420 --> 30:41.940
Thank you.

30:42.770 --> 30:44.710
I hope it helps.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.780
(clears throat)

30:52.580 --> 30:55.030
KNIGHT:
<i>Any luck finding</i>
<i>that silver Prius?</i>

30:55.230 --> 30:56.330
You know,
I don't know what's worse.

30:56.530 --> 30:58.470
Combing through
traffic cam footage

30:58.670 --> 31:01.360
or combing through septic tanks.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.040
When did you comb
through a septic tank?

31:04.240 --> 31:06.440
You know, McGee, some things you
just don't want to talk about.

31:06.640 --> 31:09.280
Mm.
The point is that dozens
of Priuses

31:09.480 --> 31:11.280
drive by Logan's street
every day.

31:11.480 --> 31:14.390
It's a shame his stalker
didn't drive something cooler.

31:14.590 --> 31:15.690
Like a Corvette.

31:15.890 --> 31:17.190
Yeah, or like a Porsche.

31:17.390 --> 31:18.460
Or a Miata.

31:18.660 --> 31:19.690
Huh?

31:19.890 --> 31:21.630
Brah. Ugh.

31:21.830 --> 31:24.100
Hey, hey.
Don't be hating on Miata now.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.300
They're cheap,

31:25.500 --> 31:28.100
reliable,
unlimited smiles per gallon.

31:28.300 --> 31:29.630
I had one.

31:29.830 --> 31:32.250
Back in '95. (sighs)

31:33.250 --> 31:35.790
Rest in peace, Red Bandit.

31:36.790 --> 31:38.460
Do you need a moment?

31:40.330 --> 31:43.650
No, I'm good. I heard we got
a new lead on our stalker?

31:43.850 --> 31:46.720
Yes. We compared
the fired engineers

31:46.920 --> 31:49.120
to the stalker
on the doorbell cam,

31:49.320 --> 31:50.890
and narrowed it down
to nine suspects.

31:51.090 --> 31:52.920
Any of them drive
a silver Prius?

31:53.120 --> 31:54.530
Surprisingly, no.

31:54.730 --> 31:57.290
Maybe we're barking up the wrong
tree with these engineers.

31:57.490 --> 31:59.130
No, it's the right tree.

31:59.330 --> 32:00.500
I'm looking through
the engineers'

32:00.700 --> 32:01.870
social media profiles.

32:02.070 --> 32:04.420
One of them has this tattoo.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.470
Is that the Golden Snitch
from <i>Harry Potter?</i>

32:09.670 --> 32:12.680
No, actually, that tattoo
is of the fairy Ragadar

32:12.880 --> 32:14.480
from the <i>Kingdom of Avis.</i>

32:14.680 --> 32:16.550
It's a video game.
Oh.

32:16.750 --> 32:17.950
That fairy matches the logo

32:18.150 --> 32:20.130
that was on
our stalker's hoodie.

32:23.640 --> 32:27.270
All right, bring in our fired
engineer for a little chat.

32:29.810 --> 32:31.800
Never seen that guy before.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.700
Really? Because this
is the FDA officer

32:34.900 --> 32:37.030
that got you fired
from Dynamical.

32:37.230 --> 32:40.140
Must be rough going from
a biotech engineering job

32:40.340 --> 32:42.570
to, uh, making kitchen sinks.

32:42.770 --> 32:45.410
I'm a faucet valve engineer.

32:45.610 --> 32:47.040
(laughs) Okay.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.780
So, if you don't know him,

32:48.980 --> 32:50.680
then why are you spending
so much time

32:50.880 --> 32:52.520
lurking on his sidewalk?

32:52.720 --> 32:54.120
That could be anyone.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.050
You've got an identical hoodie
hanging in your closet.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.290
KNIGHT:
And we found this
email on your laptop

32:59.490 --> 33:00.720
to Logan.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.830
"You ruined my life,
so I'm going to ruin yours."

33:05.030 --> 33:06.400
That could mean anything.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.070
Oh, I think it means

33:08.270 --> 33:11.140
that you blame Logan
for ruining your life.

33:11.340 --> 33:13.540
Lost your job, your
home, your marriage.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.970
And now you live
in a tiny little apartment

33:16.170 --> 33:18.480
and you don't even own
a real couch.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.150
It's not illegal to own
inflatable furniture.

33:21.350 --> 33:24.680
No, but felony assault is.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.780
Wait, what?

33:25.980 --> 33:27.550
Logan's wife stabbed him.

33:27.750 --> 33:30.620
Because this was implanted
in her arm.

33:30.820 --> 33:31.790
You put it there.

33:31.990 --> 33:33.190
That's felony assault.

33:33.390 --> 33:35.230
It was probably easy enough
for you to steal.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.200
Then all you'd have to do
is bribe someone to implant it.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.660
Okay, can we just slow down
for a second?

33:39.860 --> 33:41.900
I'm sorry, McGee, I'm
starting to lose count.

33:42.100 --> 33:43.130
How many charges is that?

33:43.330 --> 33:46.170
Uh, well, we got
stalking, bodily harm...

33:46.370 --> 33:47.870
I didn't steal that implant.

33:48.070 --> 33:50.110
...bribery, assault,
corporate theft.

33:50.310 --> 33:53.560
I said I didn't steal
this implant. Logan did.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.180
Go on.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.050
Okay, okay. Geez, look. Look.

33:58.250 --> 34:00.780
The day that I was fired,

34:00.980 --> 34:03.920
I saw Logan swipe
one of the prototypes.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.520
Logan?

34:05.720 --> 34:08.160
Yeah. And I figured
that he was swiping it

34:08.360 --> 34:11.200
for the competition,
but I also figured,

34:11.400 --> 34:14.170
hey, if he was gonna make
a quick buck, then so was I.

34:14.370 --> 34:16.530
You were gonna blackmail him.

34:16.730 --> 34:20.100
The email that I sent him
was the warning.

34:20.300 --> 34:22.340
And then, uh,
I was gonna, I was gonna

34:22.540 --> 34:24.740
go to his house
and I was gonna confront him.

34:24.940 --> 34:27.440
And then, I-I made it as far
as the walkway a few times,

34:27.640 --> 34:29.780
but I never worked up
the nerve to knock.

34:29.980 --> 34:34.290
So, if Logan stole the implant
to sell to the competition,

34:34.490 --> 34:37.290
how did it end up
in his wife's arm?

34:37.490 --> 34:41.070
Well, you're asking
the wrong guy, aren't you?

34:51.750 --> 34:53.500
Do we believe him?

34:53.700 --> 34:56.170
Don't know. He doesn't
have any proof.

34:56.370 --> 34:58.310
Well, I guess we wait till
Torres gets to the hospital,

34:58.510 --> 35:00.590
we see what Logan has to say.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.630
We got a problem.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.980
I was finally able to trace

35:05.180 --> 35:06.920
the shell company
that paid the dentist,

35:07.120 --> 35:10.390
and you'll never guess
who it belonged to.

35:10.590 --> 35:11.690
Logan Donohue.
Logan Donohue.

35:11.890 --> 35:13.920
Damn. How'd you know that?

35:14.120 --> 35:16.290
(phone ringing)
Well, I guess now
we got our proof.

35:16.490 --> 35:17.940
Parker.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.950
When?

35:21.820 --> 35:24.170
Okay, get the lieutenant
back here.

35:24.370 --> 35:25.440
What?

35:25.640 --> 35:26.870
That was Torres.
Logan's rabbiting.

35:27.070 --> 35:28.910
He checked himself out
about an hour ago.

35:29.110 --> 35:30.540
Must have known
we'd figure it out.

35:30.740 --> 35:31.910
Bolted first chance he got.

35:32.110 --> 35:33.840
He didn't even tell
his wife he was leaving.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.950
Oh, that's not the only thing
Logan didn't tell her.

35:37.150 --> 35:40.150
I was processing Logan's laptop
when I found an email chain

35:40.350 --> 35:42.420
between him and an
estate planning attorney.

35:42.620 --> 35:43.790
That sounds riveting.
Oh, right.

35:43.990 --> 35:45.590
Normally, this stuff
makes my eyes bleed.

35:45.790 --> 35:46.920
But not this time.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.730
Logan wanted the lawyer
to draw up

35:49.930 --> 35:52.400
a power of attorney document,
giving him full control

35:52.600 --> 35:53.930
over his wife's finances.

35:54.130 --> 35:55.370
On what grounds?

35:55.570 --> 35:56.830
He claimed she needed to be
put in a conservatorship

35:57.030 --> 35:59.770
because she was unable
to care for herself.

35:59.970 --> 36:01.370
But that was
four months ago.

36:01.570 --> 36:03.010
Before she even
started getting sick.

36:03.210 --> 36:04.710
I think he was
getting a head start.

36:04.910 --> 36:07.710
He knew what would happen
once that implant went in.

36:07.910 --> 36:09.410
But why go
to all the trouble?

36:09.610 --> 36:13.250
The lieutenant has over $20,000
in credit card debt.

36:13.450 --> 36:15.120
Actually, she doesn't.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.140
(keyboard clicking)

36:19.010 --> 36:20.620
PARKER:
It seems it was your husband

36:20.820 --> 36:23.630
who opened those credit cards
in your name.

36:23.830 --> 36:25.300
KNIGHT:
We think he wanted
you to appear

36:25.500 --> 36:28.200
financially irresponsible
to help bolster his case.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.300
If he just wanted me gone,
why not just divorce me

36:30.500 --> 36:31.440
like a normal person?

36:31.640 --> 36:32.800
We don't know.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.240
We were hoping you could
help us figure that out.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.110
Well, I sure as hell don't know.

36:38.310 --> 36:40.880
I mean, Logan is the reason
why I'm working on base

36:41.080 --> 36:42.110
instead of a carrier.

36:42.310 --> 36:44.770
He said that
he wanted me closer.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.770
(scoffs)

36:50.540 --> 36:52.160
Oh, my God.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.130
I am such an idiot.

36:55.330 --> 36:57.160
It was all a lie.

36:57.360 --> 37:00.730
Love makes you see
the best in people.

37:00.930 --> 37:05.200
He must really hate me
to do something like this.

37:05.400 --> 37:09.160
We need to find Logan. Do you
have any idea where he might be?

37:12.330 --> 37:14.730
I don't know.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.180
I don't know anything right now,

37:17.380 --> 37:19.850
except that I just,
I need to go home.

37:20.050 --> 37:21.180
It might be better if you stay.

37:21.390 --> 37:23.290
I'm really done with
people telling me

37:23.490 --> 37:24.660
what to do.

37:24.860 --> 37:27.640
I'm going home.
Yeah, no, of course. You can go.

37:29.910 --> 37:30.930
We'll let you know

37:31.130 --> 37:32.810
as soon as we hear anything.

37:34.950 --> 37:37.270
Could you give Mrs.
Donohue a ride, please?

37:37.470 --> 37:38.500
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.320
This way, please.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.110
You really think
that's a good idea?

37:43.310 --> 37:46.010
I think she knows
where her husband is,

37:46.210 --> 37:48.410
but no way
was she gonna tell us.

37:48.610 --> 37:50.580
She wants to kill him herself.

37:50.780 --> 37:51.750
Probably.

37:51.950 --> 37:53.750
Honestly, though, at this point,

37:53.950 --> 37:55.800
she could be in on it.

38:00.070 --> 38:03.160
RACHEL:
You always loved
your grandpa's cabin.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.400
When I found out you left
the hospital, I...

38:06.600 --> 38:08.880
I knew you'd come here.

38:10.650 --> 38:12.070
Had to give the NCIS agent

38:12.270 --> 38:14.860
watching my house
the slip, though.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.220
Why was the NCIS
watching our house?

38:19.230 --> 38:21.960
Because they know everything.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.520
I tried to call you
when I left the hospital,

38:29.720 --> 38:31.290
but my-my phone died.

38:31.490 --> 38:33.710
Stop.

38:40.180 --> 38:42.330
I know what you did to me.

38:42.530 --> 38:43.770
Rachel, listen...

38:43.970 --> 38:46.070
The last time I hurt you,

38:46.270 --> 38:49.360
I had no idea what
was happening.

38:50.690 --> 38:52.580
And this time,

38:52.780 --> 38:56.610
I know exactly what I am doing.

38:56.810 --> 38:58.800
(grunting)

39:00.270 --> 39:02.250
(panting)

39:02.450 --> 39:04.290
Tell me.

39:04.490 --> 39:06.740
Why did you do this?

39:07.540 --> 39:08.760
Tell me.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.760
Your cousin.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.810
After she died...

39:14.310 --> 39:16.170
...she left you a trust fund.

39:16.370 --> 39:17.870
Kelly?

39:18.070 --> 39:19.800
I hadn't even
spoken to her in years.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.060
Why would she do that?

39:22.890 --> 39:24.530
(grunts)

39:26.290 --> 39:29.330
You got a letter from a lawyer
six months ago.

39:30.260 --> 39:31.950
She didn't have
any heirs,

39:32.150 --> 39:34.650
and you were her next of kin,

39:34.850 --> 39:37.300
so everything went to you.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.920
So you...

39:41.120 --> 39:43.810
you decided to hide
the letter from me?

39:46.710 --> 39:50.180
How much was my life worth?

39:51.020 --> 39:52.950
PARKER:
Put down the ax, Lieutenant.

39:56.790 --> 40:01.060
I know you're angry, Rachel,
and you have every right to be.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.830
Don't throw your life away
for him, Rachel.

40:15.910 --> 40:17.560
Hands!

40:17.760 --> 40:20.010
Cell phone.

40:27.790 --> 40:29.470
LOGAN (over phone):
You got a letter from a lawyer
six months ago.

40:29.670 --> 40:32.010
I wanted to make sure that
he didn't get away with this.

40:32.210 --> 40:34.910
...and you were her next of kin.

40:35.110 --> 40:36.280
So everything went to you.
Yeah.

40:36.480 --> 40:39.280
Yeah, you can't get
rid of me that easy.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.620
RACHEL:
So you, you decided to hide
the letter from me?

40:42.820 --> 40:44.910
(recording shuts off)

40:46.570 --> 40:49.990
JIMMY:
So, Logan <i>was</i> planning
on divorcing Rachel.

40:50.190 --> 40:51.830
Until he intercepted the
letter from the cousin.

40:52.030 --> 40:54.600
Then he found ten
million reasons to stay.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.270
Ooh, that is a lot of reasons.

40:56.470 --> 40:59.570
If they divorced or she died,
he couldn't touch the money.

40:59.770 --> 41:01.270
The only way to get
his hands on the dough

41:01.470 --> 41:04.410
was getting Rachel
into a conservatorship.

41:04.610 --> 41:07.080
So, why are you getting
rid of that? Doesn't fit?

41:07.280 --> 41:08.910
Oh, no, it fits great.

41:09.110 --> 41:11.110
Turns out, I don't
really like motorcycles.

41:11.310 --> 41:12.680
(chuckles)
And I may have gone

41:12.880 --> 41:14.080
a little overboard

41:14.280 --> 41:16.790
trying to get through
my Dream Docket so fast.

41:16.990 --> 41:18.420
Wait, does this mean
that you got

41:18.620 --> 41:20.320
your Alzheimer's test
results back?

41:20.520 --> 41:22.690
Oh, it's in my email right now.

41:22.890 --> 41:24.530
Haven't even opened it yet.

41:24.730 --> 41:26.830
Want to open it together?

41:27.030 --> 41:29.580
That's a really sweet offer...

41:31.220 --> 41:34.020
...but I think I know
what I want to do.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.550
(exhales)

41:43.750 --> 41:46.080
Now you won't know
if you have the gene.

41:46.280 --> 41:49.690
If knowing changes
the way I live my life,

41:49.890 --> 41:51.670
I'm living it wrong.

41:53.910 --> 41:55.330
Uh, about yesterday...

41:55.530 --> 41:57.040
Already forgiven.

41:57.940 --> 41:59.300
