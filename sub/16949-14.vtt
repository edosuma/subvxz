00:01.634 --> 00:05.071
{\an8}Previously on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood - The Reunion."

00:05.138 --> 00:06.606
{\an7}You tried to release
a sex tape on your girl?

00:06.673 --> 00:09.309
{\an7}It was not in the public until
y'all brought it to light.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.677
{\an8}Instead of stealing
for her son,

00:10.744 --> 00:11.911
{\an8}she should save
for braces.

00:11.978 --> 00:12.946
{\an7}(bleep)
What are you gonna do?

00:13.012 --> 00:14.013
{\an8}You can call him stupid,

00:14.080 --> 00:15.682
{\an7}but you can't call him
a gold-digger.

00:15.749 --> 00:18.118
{\an7}You called
my child ugly.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.352
{\an8}Am I sorry?
No, I'm not.

00:19.419 --> 00:20.720
{\an8}That would be a lie.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.288
{\an8}Just want to fight
and get over with.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.423
{\an8}(bleeps)

00:23.490 --> 00:24.824
{\an7}Shut up!

00:24.891 --> 00:26.192
{\an8}All right, ladies, ladies!

00:26.259 --> 00:27.460
{\an7}People are checking
for me and--

00:27.527 --> 00:30.663
{\an8}Checking to see what (bleep)
you sitting on.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.631
{\an8}Hazel made some allegations

00:32.698 --> 00:35.368
{\an8}that Fetty isn't
your daughter's father.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.404
{\an8}Well, that isn't her nose
or her cheeks or her chin.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.873
{\an7}Let's get Hazel's side
of the story.

00:39.939 --> 00:41.141
{\an8}She keep on talking (bleep).

00:41.207 --> 00:43.109
{\an8}Come on, Masika.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.109
{\an8}What's that you're talking?

00:43.176 --> 00:44.778
Hey, hey!

00:44.844 --> 00:45.779
(yells)

00:45.845 --> 00:47.280
{\an8}And tonight, on part two

00:47.347 --> 00:49.149
{\an8}of "Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Hollywood -
The Reunion."

00:49.215 --> 00:50.316
{\an8}Turn your fat ass around.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.351
{\an8}The only thing burning
is that vagina.

00:51.418 --> 00:52.652
{\an8}Gotta be your vagina,

00:52.719 --> 00:53.820
{\an7}with all the (bleep)
we've seen go through it.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.821
{\an8}I took it as an insult.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.022
{\an8}Take a few steps back.

00:56.089 --> 00:57.424
{\an8}You're corny.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.125
{\an7}You need to just tone it down
a little bit.

00:59.192 --> 01:00.427
{\an8}You are facing
some real jail time.

01:00.493 --> 01:01.628
{\an8}I'm scared (bleep)-less.

01:01.694 --> 01:03.396
{\an8}Beat your
mother (bleep) ass!

01:03.463 --> 01:04.596
{\an8}(bleep) is
you talking about?

01:04.664 --> 01:06.800
{\an7}Shut the (bleep) up.
I'm not talking to you.

01:06.866 --> 01:07.901
{\an8}He got mad
'cause I said Safaree

01:07.967 --> 01:09.669
{\an8}had better (bleep)
than him.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.070
{\an8}I don't hear nothing
on that side of the room.

01:11.137 --> 01:12.272
{\an8}What's the next question?

01:12.338 --> 01:13.640
{\an8}Your husband
just had a baby on you.

01:13.706 --> 01:14.974
{\an8}What?

01:22.348 --> 01:24.284
{\an1}Let's get Hazel's side
of the story.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.485
{\an1}I'm not sitting
on the couch with her, like...

01:25.552 --> 01:26.786
{\an4}Please welcome Hazel
to the stage.

01:25.552 --> 01:26.786
Okay.

01:26.853 --> 01:29.456
Well, to all, I'm leaving.
It's her or me.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.624
{\an8}I said, when she threw
the drink at me,

01:31.691 --> 01:33.793
that I'm not giving her
any more camera time.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.662
{\an5}Masika, please sit.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.662
Uh-uh.

01:35.728 --> 01:38.531
{\an1}People are talking (bleep).
Y'all ain't get what?

01:38.598 --> 01:39.933
Come on, Masika, please.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.067
{\an1}What's that (bleep)
you're talking?

01:41.134 --> 01:42.068
I brought her back
from the dead

01:42.135 --> 01:43.403
and she can die.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.305
{\an1}No, actually, I came out
retirement for your fat ass.

01:45.371 --> 01:46.639
If you didn't do that scene,
you wouldn't have been here.

01:46.706 --> 01:49.375
{\an1}Hey, little peacock.
Go away, peacock.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.144
Would you sit on the couch
and we can talk that way?

01:51.211 --> 01:52.879
{\an1}Absolutely not.
She can't breathe in my air.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.247
{\an5}Drew, switch with us.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.247
No.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.082
Let's maybe get there.
Maybe we can get there.

01:56.149 --> 01:58.251
Masika, come on.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.119
{\an1}Are you gonna apologize for
what you said about my daughter?

02:00.186 --> 02:02.155
{\an8}Or for throwing the drink
when I tuned my back

02:02.222 --> 02:03.389
{\an8}and then telling everybody
that you beat me up?

02:03.456 --> 02:04.624
{\an7}Well, bitch,
I wasn't done with you.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.359
{\an7}No one told you
to turn your fat ass around.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.094
Okay, see, this is why,
this is why.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.930
{\an1}Aww, did your feelings hurt,
"Mathika"?

02:10.997 --> 02:13.533
{\an7}You can dish it
but you can never take it.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.034
{\an8}Masika, don't leave.

02:15.101 --> 02:16.903
Let's try to get
to the bottom of it.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.472
Hazel, why did you decide
to involve yourself

02:19.539 --> 02:20.740
and make that statement?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.809
{\an1}I think she went on "VH1 live,"
said, Hazel who?

02:22.876 --> 02:24.611
{\an1}So she started it.
Then I--

02:24.677 --> 02:25.712
By saying "Hazel who?"

02:25.778 --> 02:26.913
{\an1}Yeah, like,
she didn't know who I was.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.481
The bitch knows who I am.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.016
Then she furthered it, lied

02:30.083 --> 02:31.518
{\an1}and said Fetty
wasn't on the record,

02:31.584 --> 02:32.685
so if we gonna ask questions,

02:32.752 --> 02:34.053
{\an1}then I'm gonna ask
the burning question,

02:34.120 --> 02:36.689
like, is it Fetty's or not?
Like, don't get mad at me.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.424
The only thing burning
is that vagina.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.893
You know what I'm saying?

02:39.959 --> 02:41.094
{\an1}Actually,
that'd be your vagina,

02:41.160 --> 02:43.162
{\an1}with all the (bleep)
we've seen go through it

02:43.229 --> 02:44.564
{\an8}in this (bleep) three seasons.

02:43.229 --> 02:44.564
{\an7}No, my vagina is actually
just great, it's just great.

02:44.631 --> 02:45.765
{\an8}You should ask
your ex-boyfriend.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.634
{\an7}One line, everything
like that, honey.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.236
{\an5}But Hazel,
why ask that question?

02:47.700 --> 02:50.236
When I crashed in Dubai,

02:50.303 --> 02:52.872
{\an1}and she made up this rumor
saying I faked a crash,

02:52.939 --> 02:55.074
{\an1}that I almost died on
to get a nose job,

02:55.141 --> 02:58.444
did I ever get an apology?

02:58.511 --> 03:00.246
Masika, did you have an issue
with her--

03:00.313 --> 03:01.748
{\an1}I'm not doing this.
She could get off the stage

03:01.814 --> 03:02.882
and we can talk to me.

03:02.949 --> 03:04.317
What if we move some things
around?

03:04.384 --> 03:05.985
What if we move her down here?

03:06.052 --> 03:07.887
Would you be willing
to come back on the stage?

03:07.954 --> 03:09.489
Move her back to
the (bleep) holding cell,

03:09.556 --> 03:11.991
and then when I leave,
bring her back.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.660
Teairra, you're also friends
with both of them.

03:13.726 --> 03:14.961
Are you in the middle?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.230
{\an7}Yeah, I just don't like
when people bring kids up,

03:17.297 --> 03:19.599
{\an7}throwing the drink, hitting her,
that's how you felt.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.001
Kudos to you, bitch.

03:22.068 --> 03:26.172
Moniece, do you think that Hazel
owes Masika an apology?

03:26.239 --> 03:29.442
Not even that I can't really
speak on it, 'cause I did it,

03:29.509 --> 03:30.643
you know what I'm saying?

03:30.710 --> 03:31.911
so that would be
hypocritical of me.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.147
Kids just need to be
left out of it.

03:34.213 --> 03:37.050
{\an8}At least, I felt like
when I did it, I told the truth.

03:37.116 --> 03:38.818
I (bleep) with you,
Masika's my friend,

03:38.885 --> 03:42.088
{\an1}but that comment, that one,
like, you guys are fair game.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.290
Nia, you're also seeming like--

03:44.357 --> 03:45.525
The kid thing bothers you?

03:45.592 --> 03:46.859
Yeah, just
stop talking--

03:46.926 --> 03:48.795
{\an1}Everybody needs to stop
talking about people's kids.

03:48.861 --> 03:52.065
{\an8}Everybody. I even
told her she was wrong.

03:52.131 --> 03:53.199
{\an3}I did it.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.734
Masika, do you think
that she did

03:54.801 --> 03:56.803
the song with him
to spite you?

03:56.869 --> 03:58.838
There is no song
with Fetty, honey.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.139
There's no song?

04:00.206 --> 04:01.407
No. It don't even sound
shit like him.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.443
So she's saying
that that's not him on the song.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.478
{\an1}That's so unfortunate,
'cause it just was a record

04:05.545 --> 04:07.480
that he did a long time ago.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.782
Why is she still talking?
Why is she talking?

04:09.849 --> 04:12.986
Okay, when she...
When we get grandma off...

04:13.052 --> 04:15.588
Like, you should never spoke
my daughter's name, period.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.624
{\an1}You should stop speaking
my name, period.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.658
I didn't.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.226
They said your name,
I said, who?

04:20.293 --> 04:22.028
I said, who?
That's what I said.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.463
I don't speak your name.

04:23.529 --> 04:24.764
Hazel, how do you know Fetty?

04:24.831 --> 04:26.332
{\an5}This is so stupid.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.332
I do not know Fetty.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.334
{\an5}Oh, you don't know him?

04:26.399 --> 04:28.334
No.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.334
Exactly.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.569
{\an1}When you're doing music
in this industry,

04:29.636 --> 04:31.337
you can go into a studio

04:31.404 --> 04:32.905
{\an1}and if somebody has a hook
on a track,

04:32.972 --> 04:34.173
you can go and do a verse.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.508
Okay. So it was a hook
that you used

04:35.575 --> 04:37.176
{\an5}for a song and it's your song.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.176
This is hilarious.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.646
Yes, I never had to meet the man
to do a record with him.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.316
{\an8}I didn't go in the studio
with Fetty and, like,

04:43.383 --> 04:44.417
have him to (bleep)
for the tracks,

04:44.484 --> 04:46.152
I actually did business
to get it.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.987
{\an1}You never did a record with him,
which is why it's been pulled

04:48.054 --> 04:50.390
{\an1}from YouTube
and every (bleep) thing else.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.259
{\an5}Is this something that you plan
on releasing?

04:50.456 --> 04:53.259
It's already released,

04:53.326 --> 04:54.794
it's already doing
very well on iTunes.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.062
{\an1}It's already copyright,
getting sued

04:56.129 --> 04:57.530
{\an5}and every (bleep) thing else.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.530
It's popping.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.198
{\an1}Just went to Dubai, performed
the record, you know,

04:59.265 --> 05:00.967
I'm international
with it, so.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.002
Do you think it's right
that a lot of people

05:03.069 --> 05:04.737
label Masika a gold-digger?

05:04.804 --> 05:06.439
{\an5}Okay, all right, I'm gone.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.439
I don't even think
it's a gold-digger,

05:06.506 --> 05:10.009
{\an5}I just think that's
she's a pro, so.

05:06.506 --> 05:10.009
Okay. And I think you're a ho.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.477
{\an5}So whatever.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.477
Bye, pro.

05:11.544 --> 05:12.945
{\an6}All right.

05:11.544 --> 05:12.945
Aww, her feelings are hurt.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.248
My feelings feel like that
plastic-ass body of yours.

05:15.314 --> 05:16.482
Can't feel (bleep).

05:16.549 --> 05:18.117
I guess that's it.
It doesn't look like

05:18.184 --> 05:20.286
there's gonna be any resolution
with that situation.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.221
{\an1}I really wanted them
to have this conversation.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.491
{\an5}I did as well.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.491
'Cause y'all got the best
verbiage with each other.

05:25.558 --> 05:26.759
She walked away like a punk.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.361
Well, hopefully,
we can try to get that back,

05:28.428 --> 05:30.763
but right now, we gotta move on.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.865
{\an1}I have no interest in shooting
with this bum-ass ho.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.801
{\an1}So I will not sit on the couch,
nor seat,

05:34.867 --> 05:37.336
{\an1}nor anything with this bitch
'til you apologize

05:37.403 --> 05:38.604
for what you said about my child

05:38.671 --> 05:40.573
{\an1}and then maybe we can have
a conversation

05:40.640 --> 05:41.841
{\an1}about the other lies
you've told.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.943
(applause)

05:44.010 --> 05:46.045
If there's one thing
that Safaree made sure

05:46.112 --> 05:48.948
we knew about him,
it was that he was Jamaican.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.585
In his signature,
New York-meets-Jamaican accent,

05:52.652 --> 05:55.054
Safaree kicked his game
all over Tinseltown.

05:55.121 --> 05:56.556
Let's take a look.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.292
(Safaree)
Yo, right now, I love L.A.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.594
There's nothing better
than working out in the sun,

06:01.661 --> 06:03.629
coming out of the pool
and walking up

06:03.696 --> 06:05.698
to a nice sexy body girl

06:05.765 --> 06:07.600
with that ting that's
just shaped like, rrr.

06:07.667 --> 06:11.070
My girls, everything round,
butty fat, stomach flat.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.940
So, yo, the ting right.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.742
Nikki's playing me hot and cold.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.344
One day, she wanna rub up
all over the yard, mon,

06:18.411 --> 06:20.880
and then the next day, I can't
even get her 'pon the phone.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.081
Say something in Jamaican,

06:22.148 --> 06:23.216
say everybody
calm the (bleep) down.

06:23.282 --> 06:25.151
{\an1}Listen, you fear rob
mongrel dog.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.722
I need to really boss up
in this relationship

06:29.789 --> 06:32.825
and find out where we are go,
'cause right now, I'm lost.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.293
{\an1}Y'all, like, in
a full-blown relationship

06:34.360 --> 06:37.163
{\an1}or you just dip
on some ballgame vibes.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.031
Uh, what?

06:39.098 --> 06:41.400
Nikki and Rosa?
Hmm.

06:41.467 --> 06:44.036
That's every bad man fantasy,
you see me?

06:44.103 --> 06:45.037
Ahh.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.510
(yells)

06:50.576 --> 06:53.212
Safaree, I have to say, a lot of
people were definitely going in

06:53.279 --> 06:55.648
on you on social media
for using your accent.

06:55.715 --> 06:57.183
What's your response
to that?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.118
{\an8}That they're stupid.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.022
Now, Rosa, let me ask you.
You have one.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.524
Did you feel
like his was forced?

07:04.590 --> 07:05.958
Did you feel like
it was authentic?

07:06.025 --> 07:08.127
{\an8}There's nothing
I can do about mine.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.197
{\an8}I wish I could turn it
on and off like he does.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.833
So, more props to him
for doing that.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.569
{\an1}You better give me my props,
you have to!

07:16.636 --> 07:19.639
{\an1}That's what you gotta do.
That's it.

07:19.705 --> 07:21.541
You are just, like,
too corny.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.876
Like, you need to just
tone it down a little bit.

07:23.943 --> 07:24.877
I didn't hear what you said,

07:24.944 --> 07:26.145
I'm too horny?
What'd you say?

07:26.212 --> 07:28.581
Uh-uh. No, you know
exactly what I say.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.516
Maybe that, too.
Put every--

07:30.583 --> 07:31.751
{\an1}I don't hear nothing
on that side of the room.

07:31.818 --> 07:34.353
{\an5}What's the next question?

07:31.818 --> 07:34.353
{\an3}You know...

07:34.420 --> 07:36.489
When you can pay
for Nikki's dinner,

07:36.556 --> 07:38.457
we can talk about something.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.927
Okay? You don't even
reach for your wallet

07:40.993 --> 07:42.361
{\an5}when you go out with Nikki.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.361
Hey, listen.

07:42.428 --> 07:45.064
{\an1}And she's not the only one.
A lot of girls in L.A.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.365
{\an5}said the same thing
about you.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.365
Listen, listen, listen...

07:46.432 --> 07:48.467
{\an1}Shut the (bleep) up.
I'm not talking to you,

07:48.534 --> 07:51.404
{\an1}with your stupid-ass fur,
okay?

07:51.470 --> 07:55.208
{\an1}You sound like the ultimate
(bleep) right now.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.877
{\an5}Safaree, she's still a lady.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.877
What did you say?

07:57.944 --> 07:59.111
And I understand if
you have some words with her,

07:59.178 --> 08:00.913
but you don't have
to be disrespectful.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.281
She's still a woman.

08:02.348 --> 08:05.785
{\an1}A real man would, like,
just handle it in another way,

08:05.852 --> 08:07.153
{\an1}but he wants to be
somebody else,

08:07.220 --> 08:11.023
{\an1}he wants to be Ray J,
he wanna be him, him, this guy.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.825
{\an1}He's, like,
trying to be everybody.

08:12.892 --> 08:16.028
{\an4}Just be yourself.
It's okay to be yourself.

08:12.892 --> 08:16.028
Let's dive into this, Nikki.

08:16.095 --> 08:17.930
Can we talk about maybe
what some of the issues

08:17.997 --> 08:19.498
{\an5}you have with Safaree are?

08:17.997 --> 08:19.498
I just feel like, you know,

08:19.565 --> 08:23.169
Safaree, as far as mentally,
financially and every aspect,

08:23.236 --> 08:25.738
{\an1}you gotta get yourself together
before you can be with me

08:25.805 --> 08:29.208
or anybody,
and that's what it was.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.477
The women may have had a hard
time getting along this season,

08:32.544 --> 08:35.414
but the guys all seem
to have each other's backs.

08:35.481 --> 08:37.783
Whether it was working out
or staking out,

08:37.850 --> 08:39.818
the fellas made sure
they kept a strong bond.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.587
You know we did.

08:41.654 --> 08:42.755
Let's take a look.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.857
♪♪

08:48.494 --> 08:51.130
I think we done, man, you done
did it, you did it know.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.432
{\an1}Yeah, my (bleep), your stomach
supposed to look like that.

08:53.499 --> 08:54.934
{\an5}Oh!

08:53.499 --> 08:54.934
You feel me?

08:55.001 --> 08:57.536
{\an1}Bro...
You used to talk to Nikki.

08:57.603 --> 08:58.704
I'm talking to her.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.606
All these women out here
are the same, bro.

09:00.673 --> 09:04.010
{\an1}You gotta ask yourself, too,
is there a third party?

09:04.076 --> 09:05.645
(scoffs)

09:05.711 --> 09:08.047
My (bleep).
They in there kissing.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.482
Oh, wow.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.918
{\an1}What you do?
Make me proud, my (bleep).

09:11.984 --> 09:14.854
{\an1}So, look, I had what you told
me in the back of my head.

09:14.921 --> 09:18.057
So I just looked at her,
I said, I want this.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.326
I want it all.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.928
And what happened?
And you got it all.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.063
I didn't get it all.
I didn't get it all.

09:25.932 --> 09:28.334
You got me (bleep) up.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.169
You got me (bleep) up.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.604
{\an3}<i>Oh, really?</i>

09:30.236 --> 09:31.604
{\an1}<i>Yeah.</i>

09:31.671 --> 09:32.905
<i>First off, you don't</i>
<i>address me like that</i>

09:32.972 --> 09:34.707
when I'm sitting down.
Hi, how are you?

09:34.774 --> 09:36.108
Nice to see you, too, okay?

09:36.175 --> 09:38.444
I walk in and see you
kissing another bitch?

09:38.511 --> 09:40.980
{\an1}But look how I walked in
on you kissing another chick.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.715
{\an1}I would never put you
in no situation like that.

09:42.782 --> 09:45.117
{\an1}I'm gonna put my mind,
body and my face into it.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.653
{\an1}<i>I'm gonna put my mind,</i>
<i>my body, my faith into it.</i>

09:47.720 --> 09:49.322
Safaree...

09:49.388 --> 09:50.623
<i>Can you be serious</i>
<i>right now?</i>

09:50.690 --> 09:53.159
Now, that's
what friends are for.

09:57.496 --> 10:00.032
Safaree, I have to ask off top,

10:00.099 --> 10:03.469
why would you take advice
from Ray J?

10:03.536 --> 10:05.604
Why would you do that?

10:05.671 --> 10:08.808
{\an5}It just was an experiment,
because--

10:05.671 --> 10:08.808
And that failed horribly.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.376
You know what I'm saying?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.145
Like, I just felt like I was
just falling in love so deep,

10:13.212 --> 10:15.348
I'm like, I need to try
to really come at this

10:15.414 --> 10:17.917
at another angle, so I'm like,
you know what?

10:17.984 --> 10:19.185
This looks like a good idea.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.356
{\an5}All right,
you were just helping out.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.356
Hold on a second, hold on.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.491
{\an1}I don't even know why
I acted like that just now.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.827
{\an1}Rosa, I'm sorry.
Seriously, I'm sorry.

10:27.893 --> 10:29.028
Oh, that's really nice of you.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.597
{\an1}Like I said, I--
I have no problems with you.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.333
{\an1}I was giving you props and
the fact that you got back at me

10:34.400 --> 10:36.002
{\an1}with that, like,
kind of like, threw me off.

10:36.068 --> 10:37.703
I probably didn't even hear it,
or know

10:37.770 --> 10:39.338
that that's what she said,
so you know what I'm saying?

10:39.405 --> 10:40.840
{\an1}No, I gave you props.
Put the tele--

10:40.906 --> 10:42.975
{\an5}Guys, subtitles for me.

10:40.906 --> 10:42.975
All right, okay, you got it.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.277
{\an3}Oh, my God.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.580
{\an1}That was some real man
(bleep) right there, homey.

10:47.646 --> 10:48.614
Love, my (bleep).

10:48.681 --> 10:50.383
Now, Nikki, how did you feel

10:50.449 --> 10:53.886
about seeing Ray J put words
into Safaree's mouth?

10:53.953 --> 10:56.022
I had no clue.

10:56.088 --> 10:58.057
{\an1}When you saw me, I was like,
who the (bleep) you talking to?

10:58.124 --> 11:02.028
{\an1}I was like, you never bossed up
on me like this before.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.529
Let me ask a question.

11:03.596 --> 11:04.997
It seem like the men
got along really well,

11:05.064 --> 11:08.067
but was it awkward for you,
Safaree,

11:08.134 --> 11:11.670
to ask advice to Fizz knowing
that he and Nikki had a past.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.873
Nah. It was just like
a normal conversation.

11:13.939 --> 11:16.208
How did you feel
about that situation, Fizz?

11:16.275 --> 11:17.943
I just wanted to make sure
he didn't get lost

11:18.010 --> 11:20.446
{\an7}in the sauce, you feel me?
'Cause it's some good sauce.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.814
Oh.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.814
{\an3}So...

11:21.881 --> 11:23.182
Okay.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.518
{\an1}L.A. got a lot of good sauce,
you feel me?

11:25.584 --> 11:26.819
I wasn't tripping
on that.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.054
I thought you was tripping.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.423
I would be tripping
if I lost me, too.

11:30.489 --> 11:31.557
Oh, nah, nah.

11:31.624 --> 11:32.825
It's a million Nikkis
out there.

11:32.892 --> 11:34.593
Oh, there's a million?

11:34.660 --> 11:36.362
I could build a bitch any day.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.598
{\an1}Bring her to me, 'cause she
could be my bitch, too.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.867
Let me tell you, the--
Where it all spiraled.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.403
{\an1}He got mad 'cause I said Safaree
had better (bleep) than him,

11:44.470 --> 11:47.039
{\an1}and that's where the whole thing
came from, so you know what?

11:47.106 --> 11:49.141
I said what I said, but I don't
appreciate him speaking on me.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.409
You last longer than me,
good job, fam.

11:50.476 --> 11:51.944
Period, I really don't.

11:52.011 --> 11:53.546
I'm not tripping
on this (bleep).

11:53.612 --> 11:54.780
I don't have no problem
with you,

11:54.847 --> 11:56.715
but you speaking on me,
you don't--

11:56.782 --> 11:58.317
If I go around doing interviews,
I'm talking about my music

11:58.384 --> 12:01.454
and (bleep) that I actually have
talent to do, you feel me?

12:01.520 --> 12:03.823
All she could talk about is
the (bleep) she done sat on.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.891
{\an5}That's it.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.891
{\an3}Oh, okay.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.793
You're absolutely right.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.028
Things are getting heated
in here,

12:09.095 --> 12:10.463
so we're gonna take a break.

12:10.529 --> 12:13.432
Next up, Willie's past
comes back to haunt Shanda.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.501
It's "Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Hollywood
- The Reunion."

12:18.938 --> 12:21.240
{\an8}I took care of your ass.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.240
{\an8}(bleep)

12:21.307 --> 12:22.608
{\an8}(bleeps)

12:22.675 --> 12:23.709
{\an8}How about that?

12:23.776 --> 12:24.877
{\an8}What is you talking about?

12:24.944 --> 12:26.479
{\an8}You are facing
some real jail time.

12:26.545 --> 12:27.713
{\an8}I'm scared (bleep)-less.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.348
{\an8}A1 had lipo.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.051
{\an8}Your husband just had a baby
on you.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.153
{\an8}He asked her about her (bleep).

12:34.220 --> 12:36.155
{\an8}And she said she wanted
to (bleep) his (bleep).

12:34.220 --> 12:36.155
{\an5}What?

12:44.830 --> 12:46.832
(cheering and applause)

12:48.834 --> 12:52.371
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood - The Reunion."

12:52.438 --> 12:55.341
After Willie got caught
sexting with another woman,

12:55.407 --> 12:57.743
Shanda pressed him
for the truth,

12:57.810 --> 13:00.479
but when Willie didn't come
clean about his infidelity,

13:00.546 --> 13:03.115
Shanda considered
setting him free.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.818
What have you been doing?
Outside of your marriage?

13:08.220 --> 13:09.455
Nothing.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.490
{\an1}See, Kyesha, she brought this
to me, baby.

13:13.926 --> 13:15.361
{\an5}I apologize for that.

13:13.926 --> 13:15.361
{\an1}Oh, so you think
that (bleep) cool?

13:15.427 --> 13:16.362
It's definitely not cool.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.164
Stupid (bleep).
You're stupid.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.366
{\an1}You're (bleep) stupid,
you (bleep).

13:20.432 --> 13:21.767
So you're looking
for attention, huh?

13:21.834 --> 13:23.102
You still telling me
you love me, right?

13:23.169 --> 13:24.503
When?
Do you--

13:24.570 --> 13:26.238
{\an1}It's in the (bleep)
text messages!

13:26.305 --> 13:27.740
'Cause you're here,
trying to--

13:27.806 --> 13:30.576
{\an1}Because that's the reason why
I told you about the pregnancy.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.644
What pregnancy?

13:31.710 --> 13:32.945
Are you serious?!

13:33.012 --> 13:35.047
These are
some serious accusations

13:35.114 --> 13:37.550
and Willie better start making
sense of it all right now.

13:37.616 --> 13:40.252
We did meet up
on December 12th of 2015

13:40.319 --> 13:42.054
at the Red Roof Inn Hotel.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.659
Guess What?
I still (bleep)!

13:46.725 --> 13:47.893
Yeah, well, (bleep) who?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.795
♪ When he mad at you,
he come to me ♪

13:49.862 --> 13:52.064
♪ For 12 years,
we been creeping ♪

13:52.131 --> 13:54.400
♪ The only thing on me
that's fat is my ass ♪

13:57.937 --> 14:00.906
I think Shanda was more mad
that her wig came off

14:00.973 --> 14:02.208
than the girl charging at her.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.743
{\an1}It's a wig, bitch,
but I can (bleep) you up!

14:04.810 --> 14:07.580
Bitch!
You got the right one!

14:09.615 --> 14:11.784
{\an1}I got up with her
that one time.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.356
The whole union, you know,
it's in jeopardy.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.225
You cheated
and I can't trust you.

14:19.291 --> 14:20.759
You're untrustworthy.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.901
Willie, let me ask you.
Why not just come clean?

14:28.968 --> 14:31.670
{\an8}I felt like at the time, man,
my whole life was in jeopardy.

14:31.737 --> 14:33.572
{\an1}Everything that you love
and you care for

14:33.639 --> 14:37.443
is just going to be diminished
and I just spoke too quickly,

14:37.509 --> 14:39.011
{\an1}which was the wrong thing
to do.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.412
{\an8}If you would have told me
the truth,

14:40.479 --> 14:44.083
{\an8}even when I asked, or prior
to even filming this season,

14:44.149 --> 14:46.318
{\an1}I would have been okay and
we could have figured it out,

14:46.385 --> 14:48.120
{\an1}but the fact that you put me
in this situation

14:48.187 --> 14:50.189
and had me on national
TV like this,

14:50.256 --> 14:51.724
that pissed me off,
and I'm like, damn,

14:51.790 --> 14:53.158
{\an1}you gonna put your family out
like that?

14:53.225 --> 14:55.160
So you were truly blindsided?

14:55.227 --> 14:57.162
Oh, 100% blindsided.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.765
Willie, can you please explain,
now that you are open

14:59.832 --> 15:02.935
to coming clean, what was
your relationship with Kyesha?

15:03.002 --> 15:04.703
{\an1}There was nothing
between Kyesha and me.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.406
{\an1}Back in the day, my friend
used to date her friend.

15:07.473 --> 15:08.974
{\an1}And I used to be the wingman
to get her out the way

15:09.041 --> 15:10.542
{\an1}while he go do his thing,
so I--

15:10.609 --> 15:12.511
And this laughing on stage, do
you guys just not believe this?

15:12.578 --> 15:14.913
{\an1}No, I laugh because
I know the whole play

15:14.980 --> 15:16.515
with the wingman thing.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.017
(bleep) ain't funny, because
this is my (bleep) real life.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.119
{\an1}This happened to me for real,
so ain't (bleep) funny.

15:20.185 --> 15:21.220
This is not your ex?

15:21.287 --> 15:23.088
{\an1}This is not my ex.
Ever.

15:23.155 --> 15:25.057
{\an5}Please hear me when I say that.

15:23.155 --> 15:25.057
All right.

15:25.124 --> 15:28.294
Well, let's hear Kyesha's side
of the story.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.397
Please welcome her
to the stage.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.065
(cheering and applause)

15:42.408 --> 15:44.510
All right.
We're gonna dive into it.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.345
We've heard
Willie's explanation.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.647
You said that you were both
in love.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.716
{\an5}Can you tell me--

15:48.714 --> 15:50.716
When the (bleep)
was we in love?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.085
{\an3}Be honest.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.521
I hear you, but goddamn,
I know (bleep) for real.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.356
{\an5}When the (bleep)
was we in love, please?

15:55.587 --> 15:57.356
I'm gonna ask her.

15:57.423 --> 16:01.960
{\an7}Well, unfortunately, Willie--
and the text message proved it.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.562
When were we in love?
(bleep)

16:03.629 --> 16:05.331
You got one set
of text messages

16:05.397 --> 16:07.232
from the time we (bleep)
did what we did

16:07.299 --> 16:09.301
and that's the (bleep) it.
When were we in love?

16:09.368 --> 16:11.503
{\an1}It was more-- Me and you
was in a relationship,

16:11.570 --> 16:13.072
{\an5}what are you talking about?

16:11.570 --> 16:13.072
What relationship?

16:13.138 --> 16:15.140
{\an5}Are you kidding me?

16:13.138 --> 16:15.140
Are you saying
that you're his ex?

16:15.207 --> 16:16.675
{\an5}Because he's saying you were
never in a relationship.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.675
Yes, I am his ex.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.277
{\an1}Why you sitting up here
stunting?

16:18.344 --> 16:20.079
{\an3}We dated?

16:18.344 --> 16:20.079
Yes, we did.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.780
When the (bleep)
did we date.

16:21.847 --> 16:22.815
I took care of your ass.

16:22.881 --> 16:23.949
When did you
take care of me?

16:24.016 --> 16:24.983
{\an1}The (bleep)
is you talking about that?

16:25.050 --> 16:26.552
Have that, okay,
she took it.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.854
{\an1}When you was with Quiet Storm,
you had nothing.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.322
Oh, God bless America.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.824
{\an1}And I made sure
you were straight

16:31.890 --> 16:34.660
{\an4}because you was my boyfriend
at the time.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.660
Bull (bleep).

16:34.727 --> 16:37.396
{\an4}Okay? You was broke and
you couldn't afford anything.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.396
Bull (bleep).

16:37.463 --> 16:40.032
That's a sugar mama.

16:40.099 --> 16:43.669
Kyesha, when did your
relationship with Willie end?

16:43.736 --> 16:46.205
{\an5}Because they're saying
it was a long time ago.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.205
At the Red Roof Inn.

16:46.271 --> 16:47.506
It was an off and on thing.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.274
I don't want to hear
this (bleep) no more.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.676
Are you not married?

16:50.743 --> 16:53.078
{\an5}I'm clearly divorced.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.078
{\an1}I can't.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.547
Okay, but can we ask
if she was pregnant

16:55.614 --> 16:56.815
{\an8}by her husband or by Willie?

16:56.882 --> 16:58.417
{\an8}'Cause she keep claiming
she was pregnant by him,

16:58.484 --> 17:00.486
{\an4}but she was married,
I'm confused.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.486
Who was the pregnancy by?

17:00.552 --> 17:01.487
It's not about your bull--

17:01.553 --> 17:02.888
Anything, Willie.

17:02.955 --> 17:06.791
{\an1}Me and Shanda was pregnant
at the same time.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.560
Bull (bleep).

17:08.627 --> 17:10.529
{\an1}Willie, on my (bleep)
mama grave,

17:10.596 --> 17:12.030
{\an5}I was pregnant by your ass!

17:10.596 --> 17:12.030
Man, I don't give
a (bleep) about you

17:12.097 --> 17:14.133
{\an1}and nothing you talking about,
about (bleep) bullshit.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.301
{\an1}Don't ever in your life try
to doubt my (bleep) baby!

17:17.368 --> 17:19.171
(bleep)

17:19.238 --> 17:20.873
I wasn't about to even
show up here for this.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.709
{\an1}My truth is already out, I have
nothing more to prove to her.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.944
{\an1}The person I owe
all my apologies to is her.

17:26.011 --> 17:30.082
{\an1}Every time he into it with her,
he contacts me.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.718
{\an4}(Jason)
Can I tell you what
the text message said?

17:32.785 --> 17:34.019
Jason, you saw these?

17:34.086 --> 17:35.254
I read everything.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.789
I'm gonna tell you
what it said.

17:36.855 --> 17:39.558
{\an1}You ain't nothing
but (bleep) starter.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.527
Hold on, baby, baby, baby...

17:41.593 --> 17:43.662
Look, you have one song that
didn't make it to iTunes,

17:43.729 --> 17:45.130
you never gonna chart
and you ain't even got a man,

17:45.197 --> 17:48.133
so shut the (bleep) up.
How about that?

17:48.200 --> 17:49.168
The (bleep)
is you talking about?

17:49.234 --> 17:51.069
Bye!

17:51.136 --> 17:53.372
The only thing
the text message said,

17:53.439 --> 17:55.040
{\an8}he asked her
about her pink (bleep)

17:55.107 --> 17:56.775
{\an8}and she said she wanted
to suck his (bleep).

17:56.842 --> 17:59.845
{\an5}That was it.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.845
Was that really it?

17:59.912 --> 18:01.947
Jason...

18:02.014 --> 18:04.116
This (bleep) is crazy.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.219
All right, everybody,
we need to regroup, one second.

18:07.286 --> 18:10.022
All right, Shanda,
what do you believe?

18:10.088 --> 18:11.890
{\an1}I believe the fact
that he did meet up with her,

18:11.957 --> 18:13.192
which he already said.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.227
{\an1}I personally don't believe
the 12-year thing.

18:15.294 --> 18:18.096
{\an5}I don't believe it because--

18:15.294 --> 18:18.096
It's no way in (bleep) hell.

18:18.163 --> 18:19.531
And she knows that, too.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.133
So why you sitting
up there smiling,

18:21.200 --> 18:22.468
{\an1}that you know that (bleep)?
So I don't know why you

18:22.534 --> 18:23.869
even bull (bleep)
with people, just say it.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.237
{\an1}I said
it was off and on.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.372
{\an1}Oh, on and off.
That was that, that was that.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.874
If that's what you saying,
then just say that (bleep).

18:28.941 --> 18:31.743
{\an1}The truth was enough, because
my problem isn't with you,

18:31.810 --> 18:33.245
my problem is with him.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.780
{\an1}If you would have came
to me like a woman,

18:34.847 --> 18:36.515
{\an1}I would have had a little bit
more respect for you

18:36.582 --> 18:39.485
but I have zero because you
did it the way you did it.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.753
It was just (bleep) up.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.889
Everybody's at fault.
He's at fault for cheating,

18:43.956 --> 18:45.891
{\an8}but she's at fault
for condoning it, too.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.693
Is there anything else
you want to say?

18:47.759 --> 18:48.927
It's over with.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.763
Okay. Now, I know you guys
are healing.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.232
Are you back together?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.600
Well, you know, I would
love to be, but you mean--

18:54.666 --> 18:57.135
{\an1}I'm still married to my husband,
I'm just separated,

18:57.202 --> 18:59.738
{\an1}but if it don't get no better,
I gotta do what I gotta do,

18:59.805 --> 19:01.740
but at this point,
I needed to foc--

19:01.807 --> 19:02.875
{\an1}I needed a break.
I need a break.

19:02.941 --> 19:03.909
{\an1}I need to get away
from the bull (bleep),

19:03.976 --> 19:05.544
{\an1}I need to get away
from everything.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.580
{\an5}You're entitled to that.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.580
Absolutely.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.749
{\an1}He's always gonna be a big,
huge part of my life.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.417
You can't erase time like that.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.753
{\an1}You can't erase
history like that.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.954
This is my kids' father.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.257
I would never take him
out of my kids' life,

19:18.323 --> 19:21.326
so he's always gonna
be a part of my life.

19:21.393 --> 19:22.961
Well, I'm rooting for you two,
I hope it works out.

19:23.028 --> 19:25.297
All right, we've got
a lot more to come

19:25.364 --> 19:28.000
when "Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Hollywood
- The Reunion" returns.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.038
{\an7}You should chew on
one of her chew toys

19:33.105 --> 19:34.606
{\an8}with that mouth of yours.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.008
{\an8}You gonna keep talking and you
gonna have a little bit more

19:36.074 --> 19:38.510
{\an8}than them (bleep) jawbreakers
up in your mouth.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.979
{\an7}We gonna do it this way
or we ain't gonna do it at all.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.715
{\an8}You just gonna have to eat it.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.051
{\an8}Your husband just had
a baby on you.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.965
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood - The Reunion."

20:00.032 --> 20:02.935
Well, Shanda wasn't the only one
who had an unexpected visitor

20:03.001 --> 20:04.636
pop up on her in the studio.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.005
When Masika sought out
production from Max,

20:07.072 --> 20:10.542
Brandi decided to drop in
on the session and shut it down.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.110
Let's watch.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.779
{\an1}Hey, babe.

20:15.013 --> 20:17.382
{\an5}Surprise.
What's up, girl?

20:15.013 --> 20:17.382
Hello.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.484
What is Masika doing here?

20:19.551 --> 20:24.556
No way in hell is Max gonna work
with this no-talented ho.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.959
{\an4}If I say there's no session,
there will be no session.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.959
That's not true.

20:27.025 --> 20:29.094
{\an4}Oh, it's very
mother (bleep) true.

20:27.025 --> 20:29.094
I paid for the session.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.762
{\an5}Listen, Masika.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.762
Get her out of my face.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.798
{\an5}No, I don't--

20:30.829 --> 20:32.798
Get her out my face.

20:32.864 --> 20:34.232
{\an5}Get her out my face.

20:32.864 --> 20:34.232
{\an1}(bleep)

20:34.299 --> 20:36.101
{\an5}Max, put your dog on a leash.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.101
Yo, this conversation...

20:36.168 --> 20:38.437
(cross talk)

20:38.503 --> 20:39.871
Get the (bleep) outta here.

20:39.938 --> 20:42.608
{\an1}That disrespectful little bitch
trying to use to come up!

20:42.674 --> 20:45.210
She want a hit record from you.
Bitch, you're not real talent!

20:45.277 --> 20:47.145
{\an1}(bleep)
Real boss bitches!

20:47.212 --> 20:48.380
Who you talking to?

20:48.447 --> 20:49.748
You looking at the floor
or you looking at me?

20:49.815 --> 20:50.983
{\an1}I'm talking to this bitch
that just walked out of here

20:51.049 --> 20:52.551
and disrespected me and you...

20:52.618 --> 20:54.620
{\an1}Girl, in the middle of the
session, we jamming out, bitch,

20:54.686 --> 20:57.322
and walked
this rabid Chihuahua.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.657
Bitch coming in.
Yip, yip!

20:58.724 --> 20:59.925
Yip, yip!
Yip, yip, yip, yip!

20:59.992 --> 21:02.394
The bitch came in
like a wrecking ball.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.466
Max, let me ask you this.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.334
Does Brandi have a say
on who you work with

21:09.401 --> 21:10.769
in your studio sessions?

21:10.836 --> 21:13.605
{\an7}I love my woman
and I'm not gonna do (bleep)

21:13.672 --> 21:14.740
{\an8}that's gonna bother her.

21:14.806 --> 21:17.309
{\an1}It just so happens
that I'm with somebody

21:17.376 --> 21:19.244
{\an1}who will come kamikaze
my session

21:19.311 --> 21:20.846
{\an1}and I can't do nothing
about it.

21:20.912 --> 21:24.750
Brandi, were you afraid that
Masika was gonna come on to Max?

21:24.816 --> 21:26.518
{\an5}No.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.518
You weren't?
Okay.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.987
{\an1}Let's be clear.
I'm loyal.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.623
{\an7}And my best friend
and my business partner

21:31.690 --> 21:35.327
{\an7}had a very tacky situation
with her.

21:31.690 --> 21:35.327
{\an5}So tiring.

21:35.394 --> 21:38.330
{\an1}So when I'm walking in,
I'm like, this is not only news,

21:38.397 --> 21:41.166
{\an1}but I'm not no fake bitch,
I'm not gonna walk up in here,

21:41.233 --> 21:43.035
{\an1}kiki'ing hey, how you doing?
Good to see you.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.469
It's not fake,
it's professional.

21:44.536 --> 21:46.338
{\an1}No, that's my best friend
and I don't want anything to do

21:46.405 --> 21:49.207
{\an1}with anybody that tries
to mess with someone's man.

21:49.274 --> 21:50.909
Show me the receipts.
What are you talking about?

21:50.976 --> 21:52.644
{\an5}Stop it, you're lying,

21:50.976 --> 21:52.644
You should chew on one
of your chew toys

21:52.711 --> 21:53.945
with that bicuspid mouth
of yours.

21:54.012 --> 21:56.081
{\an1}You're a becky.
A proud one, you go--

21:56.148 --> 21:57.649
Oh, girl, all them molars,

21:57.716 --> 21:59.651
you talk with every tooth
(bleep).

21:59.718 --> 22:01.687
{\an5}And I think this Hollywood ho...

21:59.718 --> 22:01.687
Brandi, over here.

22:01.753 --> 22:04.790
{\an1}...up in the studio that tried
to (bleep) my best friend's man.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.325
{\an5}Begging for--

22:04.856 --> 22:07.325
Brandi, come back.

22:07.392 --> 22:09.394
He called me, I never asked
him to do anything with me.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.163
{\an1}You begged for that
mother (bleep) track.

22:11.229 --> 22:12.464
{\an1}And you thought you
was gonna go get that (bleep)

22:12.531 --> 22:14.099
{\an5}from my (bleep).

22:12.531 --> 22:14.099
He asked me to do the record.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.333
{\an5}I still don't have
his phone number.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.333
But you couldn't,

22:15.400 --> 22:16.601
{\an1}and you gonna keep talking,
and you gonna have

22:16.668 --> 22:18.170
{\an1}a little bit more
than them (bleep) jawbreakers

22:18.236 --> 22:21.173
{\an5}up in your mouth.

22:18.236 --> 22:21.173
Brandi.
Brandi, please focus.

22:21.239 --> 22:22.741
(Nina)
Don't you trust your husband?

22:22.808 --> 22:26.111
{\an1}He's a good person and sometimes
he can be too nice, like...

22:26.178 --> 22:28.146
I had nothing negative
to say about Max

22:28.213 --> 22:31.550
and then I woke up one day
and he's threatening me

22:31.616 --> 22:33.885
{\an5}and Moniece on a video
with her.

22:31.616 --> 22:33.885
I never threatened you.

22:33.952 --> 22:35.420
No, he posted it online.

22:35.487 --> 22:36.655
I took it personally,

22:36.722 --> 22:38.256
you talking
about open court cases--

22:38.323 --> 22:39.825
{\an4}What does that have to do
with me?

22:38.323 --> 22:39.825
That's crossing the line.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.727
You were being messy
and full of (bleep).

22:41.793 --> 22:43.528
{\an5}You're not above the world.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.528
Mind your business.

22:43.595 --> 22:45.363
{\an1}You're not.
You're just as (bleep) sleazy.

22:45.430 --> 22:48.366
{\an8}Sleazy? But your husband
just had a baby on you.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.836
{\an5}What do you mean?

22:48.433 --> 22:50.836
Who had a baby?

22:50.902 --> 22:52.771
{\an1}I don't even know
what you talking about.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.606
And blamed the baby on Ray.

22:54.673 --> 22:56.742
Where's the proof?

22:56.808 --> 22:58.577
There's allegations
of DMs, babies.

22:58.643 --> 22:59.745
It's a lot.

22:59.811 --> 23:01.580
{\an1}They're gonna slander me
with lies.

23:01.646 --> 23:02.914
Max, but what does this
have to do with me?

23:02.981 --> 23:04.149
I never came at you.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.151
{\an1}You said I ain't had
nothing to do with it.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.886
{\an1}My next exact words were,
okay,

23:07.953 --> 23:09.688
{\an1}I totally understand,
I apologize.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.757
{\an5}You can't say nothing about me.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.757
So why is it continuing, Max?

23:11.823 --> 23:13.291
Because y'all
continued it.

23:13.358 --> 23:15.494
No, I didn't continue nothing.
I never started anything.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.762
{\an5}(Nina)
You guys, this is gonna
go in circles.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.163
Let me ask you, Lyrica.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.999
Do you keep tabs on
who A1 works with in the studio?

23:21.066 --> 23:22.367
{\an3}Absolutely.

23:22.434 --> 23:25.303
{\an8}I understand that position
of wanting to know,

23:25.370 --> 23:27.572
{\an8}you know, who your man
is working with or whatever.

23:27.639 --> 23:30.542
Would you listen
to Lyrica's concerns

23:30.609 --> 23:32.377
if she said that she did not
want you to work

23:32.444 --> 23:33.979
{\an8}with a certain woman
in the studio?

23:34.045 --> 23:36.348
{\an8}This my wife.
Yeah.

23:36.414 --> 23:40.685
Now, if it's Beyoncé,
we gotta get that money.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.420
Well, obviously,
we get that B check.

23:42.487 --> 23:43.522
{\an1}But here's the thing,
though.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.323
{\an1}It was never said,
don't work with her.

23:45.390 --> 23:48.493
{\an1}I knew she had an issue
with my family,

23:48.560 --> 23:50.862
{\an1}but that's personal,
and as far as business goes,

23:50.929 --> 23:53.398
the record was dope,
so we met up on it

23:53.465 --> 23:55.200
because it fell
into the project

23:55.267 --> 23:57.669
that I was working on
and when it went down,

23:57.736 --> 24:00.305
I told my wife,
who I love,

24:00.372 --> 24:01.540
you shouldn't
have did it like that...

24:01.606 --> 24:03.508
you should have pulled me
to the side.

24:03.575 --> 24:04.876
But why didn't you
tell Brandi before?

24:04.943 --> 24:07.479
{\an1}Because, I'm a guy,
I just make moves sometimes,

24:07.546 --> 24:09.414
{\an1}I don't gotta ask her
everything I do.

24:09.481 --> 24:10.582
Brandi, do you understand

24:10.649 --> 24:12.384
separating business
and pleasure?

24:12.450 --> 24:14.352
{\an1}Honestly, I understand
everything,

24:14.419 --> 24:15.854
I'm very intellectual.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.589
{\an1}But at the end of the day,
like I said,

24:17.656 --> 24:21.893
{\an7}I'm loyal and when it
comes to my people,

24:21.960 --> 24:23.829
I stand by what I stand by.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.797
Well, I want to go
to another check yourself,

24:25.864 --> 24:27.732
because we caught up
with Masika and Moniece

24:27.799 --> 24:29.467
to get their reaction

24:29.534 --> 24:31.336
to some of the things
Brandi said on the show.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.804
Watch.

24:32.871 --> 24:37.342
{\an1}I don't like when people are
married, and in relationships...

24:37.409 --> 24:40.645
like my girl Beyoncé makes it
very mother (bleep) clear...

24:40.712 --> 24:41.780
Please, call her now.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.985
We're supposed to give
this bitch a round of applause?

24:47.052 --> 24:49.421
Come on, guys, like,
you're joking.

24:49.487 --> 24:51.223
No bitch can be that crazy.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.592
You that crazy.
You real crazy.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.097
Brandi, what is your
relationship with Beyoncé?

24:59.164 --> 25:03.735
{\an1}She is like a big sister to me.
Solange and I go way back.

25:03.802 --> 25:05.003
They're family to me

25:05.070 --> 25:07.806
{\an1}and ain't nobody gonna
question my credibility.

25:07.873 --> 25:10.642
{\an1}My credibility is real.
I don't pump fake out here.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.678
{\an1}(bleep) my Godmother was Miss
Whitney Houston, rest in peace.

25:13.745 --> 25:16.147
{\an4}I came in this game born
with respect...

25:13.745 --> 25:16.147
{\an3}Oh, Jesus.

25:16.214 --> 25:18.817
{\an1}and if you have an issue
and you think it's a joke,

25:18.884 --> 25:22.354
check your receipts, 'cause I
don't pump fake around here.

25:22.420 --> 25:23.822
How about you check your
receipts while you're talking

25:23.889 --> 25:24.890
like east side (bleep)
up in here?

25:24.956 --> 25:27.125
All y'all wanna be Beyoncé,

25:27.192 --> 25:28.860
all y'all wanna be Brandi.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.463
Y'all wanna be down
and you're not down.

25:31.529 --> 25:33.131
Coming up, drama from the mama

25:33.198 --> 25:36.868
sends Lyrica and A1
to the chapel all by themselves.

25:36.935 --> 25:38.570
It's "Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Hollywood
- The Reunion."

25:43.108 --> 25:45.343
{\an8}We gonna do it this way
or we ain't gonna do it at all.

25:45.410 --> 25:48.079
{\an8}Take a few steps back.

25:48.146 --> 25:49.314
{\an8}Are you afraid?

25:49.381 --> 25:50.782
{\an8}You are facing
some real jail time.

25:50.849 --> 25:52.017
{\an8}I'm scared (bleep) less.

25:52.083 --> 25:54.119
{\an8}Safaree.

25:52.083 --> 25:54.119
{\an8}No, no, we're not gonna do that.

25:54.185 --> 25:55.353
{\an8}You need to sit down.

26:02.594 --> 26:05.630
(cheering and applause)

26:05.697 --> 26:08.833
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood - The Reunion."

26:08.900 --> 26:12.604
This season, we met
new cast members Lyrica and A1.

26:12.671 --> 26:15.974
With Lyrica's career on the rise
and A1 in her corner,

26:16.041 --> 26:19.444
this couple was well
on their way to exchanging vows.

26:19.511 --> 26:23.882
But there were two people who
couldn't let bygones be bygones.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.951
Let's take a look.

26:26.017 --> 26:26.952
What's up, Mama?

26:27.018 --> 26:28.586
Oh, my God.

26:28.653 --> 26:29.721
You know, everybody can see

26:29.788 --> 26:31.022
you think you Miss Diva
anyway,

26:31.089 --> 26:32.090
{\an5}you and your mama.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.090
I don't think I'm anything.

26:32.157 --> 26:33.091
{\an5}You're not...

26:32.157 --> 26:33.091
Are you a singer?

26:33.158 --> 26:34.793
Is your mama Tina Turner?

26:34.859 --> 26:36.261
{\an1}You need to suck
that gut out.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.429
Girl, where the gut at,
look?

26:37.495 --> 26:38.430
{\an1}You need to suck
that gut, boo.

26:38.496 --> 26:40.065
Look, where the gut at?

26:40.131 --> 26:41.499
It's 100% real.

26:41.566 --> 26:44.235
It's no fake titties,
it's no fake butt.

26:44.302 --> 26:47.872
This continues to happen, how
the hell is marriage gonna work?

26:47.939 --> 26:50.041
I just wanted us
to get together.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.211
{\an1}I really don't have no beef
with you because we the adults.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.947
{\an1}So have you started looking
for a place yet?

26:56.014 --> 26:58.350
I guess didn't nobody
tell this backup singer

26:58.416 --> 27:00.285
that's none
of her damn business.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.886
We would like you guys

27:01.953 --> 27:03.555
to be able to come
to family functions

27:03.621 --> 27:05.824
and, you know,
and it not be a problem

27:05.890 --> 27:07.726
every single time
you guys get together.

27:07.792 --> 27:10.228
First of all,
we're not a family, yet.

27:10.295 --> 27:14.532
No, no, no, stop, stop.
Like, you don't do that.

27:14.599 --> 27:15.867
(bleep) outta here
with that (bleep).

27:15.934 --> 27:17.369
(bleep) ass home bitch!

27:17.435 --> 27:19.704
Y'all chill!
Y'all chill!

27:19.771 --> 27:22.173
You can't force us to be
something that we're not!

27:22.240 --> 27:24.576
I'm not even sure about you!

27:24.642 --> 27:27.645
{\an1}Chill! You got your
(bleep) daughter crying!

27:27.712 --> 27:30.348
{\an5}You chill!

27:27.712 --> 27:30.348
You don't even
(bleep) care!

27:30.415 --> 27:32.550
No, Mama, shut up!
Chill!

27:32.617 --> 27:33.651
{\an5}You know, I do--

27:32.617 --> 27:33.651
{\an1}Stop!

27:33.718 --> 27:34.786
At this point,

27:34.853 --> 27:36.721
I'm done trying
to make them get along.

27:39.124 --> 27:41.459
Okay.

27:41.526 --> 27:44.262
Pam, did you feel like you had
overstayed your welcome?

27:44.329 --> 27:46.264
{\an8}Uh, well,
it really doesn't matter.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.199
My son is not gonna
put me off on the streets

27:48.266 --> 27:49.467
until I find me a place.

27:49.534 --> 27:52.003
{\an1}And just to clarify,
it never was,

27:52.070 --> 27:53.938
{\an1}oh, get out and be
on the street,

27:54.005 --> 27:55.006
{\an1}'cause we're not
those type of people.

27:55.073 --> 27:57.809
{\an1}I accepted her
when I first got here.

27:57.876 --> 28:01.746
{\an1}But when I met her,
it became a different scenario.

28:01.813 --> 28:05.216
You feel like the beef came
from Lyrica G., not from you?

28:05.283 --> 28:06.317
{\an5}Yes.

28:05.283 --> 28:06.317
No, it definitely did.

28:06.384 --> 28:07.752
Lyrica G.,
what do you say to them

28:07.819 --> 28:09.521
feeling like you're the person
who kind of brought

28:09.587 --> 28:11.156
the bad energy into the family?

28:11.222 --> 28:13.458
{\an1}I was reacting to the things
that my daughter

28:13.525 --> 28:16.127
was telling me that was
going on in the household

28:16.194 --> 28:18.363
{\an8}and when I would come
over there and see Pam

28:18.430 --> 28:21.933
{\an8}with this somewhat
entitled attitude,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.402
then I thought
it was disrespectful.

28:24.469 --> 28:27.505
{\an1}She asked me how long was I
planning on staying with them,

28:27.572 --> 28:29.274
so I took it as an insult.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.309
You should say, hey, Pam,
what's up, how you doing?

28:31.376 --> 28:32.844
How's Kansas weather?

28:32.911 --> 28:35.980
So you just wanted to be warmed
up a little bit first, Pam.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.683
Sounded like Pam just wanted
more of an icebreaker.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.185
{\an1}And I don't--
I like her.

28:40.251 --> 28:43.421
{\an5}Straight up, I like you,
you gotta like me back.

28:40.251 --> 28:43.421
{\an3}I do.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.890
{\an5}Aww.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.890
I do, Pam, I really do.

28:45.957 --> 28:48.760
{\an5}What a moment.

28:45.957 --> 28:48.760
She likes you.

28:48.827 --> 28:51.763
Pam, when we saw the first kind
of confrontation

28:51.830 --> 28:54.666
with you and Lyrica, you implied
that your body was real.

28:54.732 --> 28:58.236
Were you trying to say
that Lyrica's body wasn't?

28:58.303 --> 29:00.171
Aww...

29:00.238 --> 29:02.774
{\an1}At the moment, I was mad,
due to a situation.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.009
I had a boob job,
I have no problem saying it.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.045
But it doesn't matter,
she look good anyway.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.313
That's probably what
she was talking about, honey,

29:08.379 --> 29:09.481
I got these boobs together,

29:09.547 --> 29:11.983
everything else on me
is all mine.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.918
{\an1}Lyrica, Lyrica, Lyrica.
I always said you looked nice,

29:13.985 --> 29:15.787
{\an1}you didn't need that.
I told you that.

29:15.854 --> 29:16.988
Oh, no, no, I know,
but I wanted it.

29:17.055 --> 29:19.457
{\an1}You still look good.
You don't need nothing.

29:19.524 --> 29:20.592
Thank you.

29:20.658 --> 29:21.960
Now, on their road to marriage,

29:22.026 --> 29:24.362
Lyrica and A1 hit a few bumps,

29:24.429 --> 29:26.131
so the couple decided
to secretly elope,

29:26.197 --> 29:28.933
and that's when things
got even rockier.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.769
We're married!

29:31.836 --> 29:34.839
Yes!

29:34.906 --> 29:36.274
(glass shatters)

29:36.341 --> 29:37.809
How could you do
something like this?

29:37.876 --> 29:40.245
{\an1}She go off and elope and I
don't know anything about it?

29:40.311 --> 29:42.046
Y'all think that's cool?
You know what?

29:42.113 --> 29:43.248
I'm gonna get the (bleep)
out of here.

29:43.314 --> 29:46.284
{\an5}Good. (bleep)

29:43.314 --> 29:46.284
(clapping)

29:46.351 --> 29:47.952
Straight up.
Woo, woo, woo!

29:48.019 --> 29:49.187
You mad at her!

29:49.254 --> 29:52.423
{\an1}I want you to try
to accept A1 as my husband.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.359
I will work on that.

29:54.425 --> 29:55.827
Okay, thank you.

29:55.894 --> 29:59.531
You know, but I need you
to do something for me.

29:59.597 --> 30:01.032
What?

30:01.099 --> 30:05.537
{\an1}I want to get some lipo,
and I want you to pay for it.

30:05.603 --> 30:06.871
{\an1}Girl, bye.

30:06.938 --> 30:10.375
I did bring you something
at a lower cost.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.579
A waist trainer.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.447
Tell your fat ass mama
to wear it!

30:16.514 --> 30:17.949
(bleep) you, (bleep) you!

30:18.016 --> 30:20.285
And I worked out--
I'm not gonna be no bitch!

30:20.351 --> 30:22.620
{\an5}I'm not gonna be no--

30:20.351 --> 30:22.620
{\an1}(bleep)

30:22.687 --> 30:26.157
This is what you brought me into
by marrying this (bleep).

30:27.392 --> 30:29.127
Who sent you to--
to do this?

30:29.194 --> 30:30.795
Lyrica Garrett.

30:30.862 --> 30:32.964
(A1)
Oh, I see what's going on here.

30:33.031 --> 30:36.000
When I first got the car,
I had credit issues,

30:36.067 --> 30:37.769
so her mom got it in her name.

30:37.835 --> 30:38.836
You had them tow the car?

30:38.903 --> 30:40.171
You wanna play games?

30:40.238 --> 30:41.272
Oh, okay.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.640
So, yes, it's my car.

30:42.707 --> 30:43.808
Come on, bitch!

30:43.875 --> 30:45.810
{\an1}Here.
I have your money right here.

30:45.877 --> 30:46.945
{\an1}(Pam)
Stupid ass (bleep).

30:47.011 --> 30:48.346
I'm gonna take your (bleep).

30:48.413 --> 30:49.914
Let's just make peace
for once,

30:49.981 --> 30:52.617
like, does it always have to
be almost a fight every time?

30:52.684 --> 30:55.486
{\an1}I want to believe that you're
sincere in your heart,

30:55.553 --> 30:58.122
{\an1}because I can't forgive you.
But it's a process.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.290
{\an1}Know that.

31:03.294 --> 31:06.931
So, A1, why did you guys decide
to just elope?

31:06.998 --> 31:08.633
{\an7}It was either
we gonna do it this way

31:08.700 --> 31:09.968
{\an8}or we ain't gonna do it at all.

31:10.034 --> 31:13.037
There's no way I would've
ruined that day

31:13.104 --> 31:15.106
{\an1}for her and I know
that he knows me well enough

31:15.173 --> 31:17.041
to know that,
so for him to do that,

31:17.108 --> 31:20.311
it was somewhat of,
I'm taking control now

31:20.378 --> 31:22.347
and you just gonna
have to eat it.

31:22.413 --> 31:23.648
Lyrica, how do you feel?

31:23.715 --> 31:27.218
{\an1}I feel like my mom has
to take a few steps back.

31:27.285 --> 31:28.886
{\an1}(audience members, clapping)
Yes.

31:28.953 --> 31:30.688
Mom, are you listening?

31:30.755 --> 31:34.292
And just know that,
I have it from here.

31:34.359 --> 31:37.462
{\an1}You gotta let her be a woman.
I'm being honest.

31:37.528 --> 31:39.130
And when you say allow her
to be a woman,

31:39.197 --> 31:41.699
I groomed her to be
the woman that she is.

31:41.766 --> 31:44.202
{\an4}You can't.

31:41.766 --> 31:44.202
I instilled certain values
in her.

31:44.269 --> 31:47.505
{\an1}She didn't become Lyrica just--
without some guidance.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.307
It's because
of how I trained her.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.175
(laughter)

31:51.242 --> 31:53.411
Well, raised,
raised, trained.

31:53.478 --> 31:55.146
Whatever!

31:55.213 --> 31:58.950
{\an5}She trained you.

31:55.213 --> 31:58.950
The Bible says
train up a child.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.318
No.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.318
No.

32:00.385 --> 32:01.953
Raise up a child,
it's the same thing.

32:02.020 --> 32:04.622
She means raise, I'll give her
that, I'll give you that.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.291
{\an1}Okay, listen, listen,
listen, listen.

32:06.357 --> 32:07.659
Okay, Lyrica, go ahead, Lyrica.

32:07.725 --> 32:09.193
{\an1}He's not what you think
and you're not what he thinks,

32:09.260 --> 32:10.528
{\an1}'cause when you guys
are separate,

32:10.595 --> 32:12.030
you're both speaking
highly of each other,

32:12.096 --> 32:15.099
{\an1}and if I choose him, that--
the man that I want to be with,

32:15.166 --> 32:16.634
{\an1}then that's
who I want to be with,

32:16.701 --> 32:19.304
{\an1}and if something goes wrong,
I'll fall on my ass on my own.

32:19.370 --> 32:21.773
Let me ask Ray J a question.

32:21.839 --> 32:25.310
You seem to sympathize a lot
with A1 and the mama drama.

32:25.376 --> 32:27.545
Do you think
that they should've eloped?

32:27.612 --> 32:28.813
You gotta do what you wanna do,

32:28.880 --> 32:30.615
{\an1}but everybody gotta follow suit
after you do it

32:30.682 --> 32:32.950
{\an7}and to support the decision
after it's done.

32:33.017 --> 32:34.886
Safaree, what was going on
in your mind

32:34.952 --> 32:36.387
when you saw the waist trainer
come out?

32:36.454 --> 32:37.522
It was, like, you know,

32:37.588 --> 32:39.490
{\an1}it's considerate
that he cares that much.

32:39.557 --> 32:41.959
(laughter)

32:42.026 --> 32:43.594
My boy.

32:43.661 --> 32:46.364
{\an5}Is the lipo still on the table?
Can they still make it up.

32:43.661 --> 32:46.364
No.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.232
You said they could make it up
with the lipo.

32:48.299 --> 32:49.934
Is that offer
still on the table?

32:50.001 --> 32:53.971
{\an8}In fairness, Lyrica had
a boob job, A1 had lipo.

32:54.038 --> 32:55.373
What?

32:55.440 --> 32:56.741
Check this out.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.744
It was no way I was
coming on TV like I was.

32:59.811 --> 33:04.582
{\an1}Then she wanted to get her boobs
done bad but was too scared,

33:04.649 --> 33:07.418
{\an1}so I said, as a good husband,
I said, look.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.320
I said, let's go in together.

33:11.856 --> 33:14.192
That's a good spin.
That's a really good spin.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.562
Coming up, a wild ride

33:17.628 --> 33:19.931
leaves Teairra
with an uncertain future.

33:19.997 --> 33:21.666
It's "Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Hollywood
- The Reunion."

33:25.436 --> 33:26.971
{\an8}Are you afraid
of going to jail?

33:27.038 --> 33:28.673
{\an8}Because you are facing
some real jail time.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.608
{\an8}Drunk,
I'm a raging demon.

33:30.675 --> 33:31.876
{\an8}I'm scared (bleep) less.

33:37.982 --> 33:40.718
(cheering and applause)

33:40.785 --> 33:43.521
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood - The Reunion."

33:43.588 --> 33:45.223
Teairra's run-in with the law

33:45.289 --> 33:47.992
might've seemed
like a small thing at first,

33:48.059 --> 33:49.427
but in a short amount of time,

33:49.494 --> 33:51.262
it snowballed
into something bigger.

33:51.329 --> 33:53.531
Let's take a look.

33:53.598 --> 33:55.266
None of us could drive,
though, after this.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.635
{\an5}No, I can drive, bitch.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.635
We gotta call an Uber, honey.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.871
{\an1}We're gonna go
to the next place.

33:59.937 --> 34:01.806
Wait, T.T., can you
even get an Uber, bitch?

34:01.873 --> 34:03.641
{\an5}Are you banned?

34:01.873 --> 34:03.641
No, I'm banned.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.276
{\an1}You banned?
What did you do, Teairra?

34:05.343 --> 34:06.844
I didn't do (bleep).

34:06.911 --> 34:08.913
{\an5}(Teairra)
About a year ago,
I got into an incident

34:08.980 --> 34:10.614
{\an8}with an Uber driver

34:10.681 --> 34:13.618
{\an8}and there are still pending
charges against me.

34:13.684 --> 34:15.485
{\an8}I need to be focused right now,

34:15.553 --> 34:18.556
not dealing with this dumbass
case that just won't go away.

34:18.623 --> 34:22.260
{\an1}So it was a miscommunication
between my attorney and I

34:22.326 --> 34:25.797
{\an1}and I was late,
so I get to the courtroom

34:25.862 --> 34:29.333
{\an1}and I got
a (bleep) bench warrant.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.136
{\an1}I'm gonna have to go
and turn myself in tomorrow.

34:32.203 --> 34:36.040
{\an1}I didn't think that it would
turn into this big issue,

34:36.107 --> 34:40.645
{\an1}so now I'm just, like, I don't
know what's gonna happen.

34:40.710 --> 34:43.447
I just wanted to know
my worst case scenario.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.917
{\an1}Well, I mean,
it's a misdemeanor,

34:45.983 --> 34:47.552
{\an1}but misdemeanors
carry up to a year.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.487
Oh, my goodness.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.355
You know, I honestly
didn't think that this case

34:51.422 --> 34:55.493
was that big a deal, but now
that I have to go to trial

34:55.560 --> 34:57.628
and could be facing
some real jail time,

34:57.695 --> 34:59.030
I'm scared as (bleep).

34:59.096 --> 35:01.232
{\an1}What do you think it is?
You think it's your temper?

35:01.299 --> 35:02.900
Do you think it's the alcohol?

35:02.967 --> 35:05.470
{\an1}Girl, I think that the alcohol
ignites my temper.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.171
{\an5}Yeah, I agree.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.171
You know what I'm saying?

35:07.238 --> 35:10.541
I don't know how to control
myself when I'm inebriated.

35:10.608 --> 35:13.211
{\an1}Sometimes I feel like you kind
of remind me of my brother,

35:13.277 --> 35:15.713
{\an1}and it scares me because
I think that you might have

35:15.780 --> 35:17.682
{\an1}a little bit of a problem
with it.

35:17.748 --> 35:19.350
{\an1}You have to be careful
with your decisions,

35:19.417 --> 35:20.985
{\an1}'cause if something happens
to you,

35:21.052 --> 35:22.753
what's gonna happen to,
you know, your friends

35:22.820 --> 35:24.789
{\an1}and your mom and people
who love you?

35:24.856 --> 35:26.591
You know, and I feel
like that's something

35:26.657 --> 35:29.660
that you forget, you know?

35:29.727 --> 35:31.496
(sobbing)

35:31.562 --> 35:33.498
To hear Nikki
compare me to her brother

35:33.564 --> 35:36.801
is quite shocking, and that
makes me very, very sad,

35:36.868 --> 35:40.505
because that could be me,
you know?

35:44.275 --> 35:46.677
Teairra, what's the status
of your case now?

35:46.744 --> 35:51.048
{\an7}Well, my trial got pushed back,
so I don't know yet.

35:51.115 --> 35:52.416
So it's a full-on trial.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.785
{\an1}Full-on trial.
I didn't want to take the plea.

35:54.852 --> 35:56.554
Why didn't you want
to take the plea?

35:56.621 --> 35:57.688
'Cause I didn't do anything.

35:57.755 --> 35:59.524
Are you afraid
of going to jail?

35:59.590 --> 36:02.226
{\an1}Because you are facing some real
jail time if you're convicted.

36:02.293 --> 36:05.530
I'm scared (bleep) less,
but I'm gonna fight it.

36:05.596 --> 36:07.498
{\an8}And I'm proud of her for that.

36:07.565 --> 36:09.667
You did say in the video that
maybe you do have a problem.

36:09.734 --> 36:11.903
Was this incident a wake-up call
for you?

36:11.969 --> 36:13.070
Yeah.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.739
{\an1}Does your temper escalate
when you drink?

36:14.805 --> 36:15.740
{\an3}Hell, yeah.

36:15.806 --> 36:17.542
{\an1}Okay.

36:15.806 --> 36:17.542
{\an3}No fear.

36:17.608 --> 36:20.411
{\an1}Hazel, you've known Teairra
for quite a long time.

36:20.478 --> 36:23.180
{\an1}Did you ever feel like
she had a problem with alcohol?

36:23.247 --> 36:24.615
Most definitely.

36:24.682 --> 36:25.816
And after we lived together

36:25.883 --> 36:27.818
for a minute,
I just noticed, like,

36:27.885 --> 36:29.186
you know, she could
throw 'em back, you know,

36:29.253 --> 36:31.422
with the best of 'em,
so just to even watch

36:31.489 --> 36:33.624
and see her even admit
that she might have

36:33.691 --> 36:35.993
a little bit of an issue
is very big of her.

36:36.060 --> 36:37.929
{\an1}All right.
Now, is there something

36:37.995 --> 36:40.798
{\an1}that you plan on doing
to treat your issue?

36:40.865 --> 36:42.500
Yeah, I mean, just...

36:42.567 --> 36:44.135
slow down, stop, you know?

36:44.201 --> 36:46.370
Stop doing
the same bull (bleep).

36:46.437 --> 36:50.308
When I'm sober, I'm calm,
collected, nice, logical.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.409
Okay.

36:51.475 --> 36:53.044
Drunk, I'm a raging demon.

36:53.110 --> 36:55.379
Now, are you seeking
professional help

36:55.446 --> 36:56.447
for your drinking problem?

36:56.514 --> 36:58.049
Um, no, not right now, no.

36:58.115 --> 37:02.753
No? Now, Ray, I know that you
known Teairra for a long time.

37:02.820 --> 37:05.256
Do you feel like
that there was ever an inkling

37:05.323 --> 37:08.459
{\an8}of a drinking problem
when you guys were together?

37:08.526 --> 37:10.561
{\an8}No, not like that.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.363
I ain't never see it
like that.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.565
{\an1}Now, I know Nikki
was your support system.

37:14.632 --> 37:16.534
{\an1}What were some of the
similarities that you saw

37:16.601 --> 37:18.970
{\an1}between your brother's
situation and hers?

37:19.036 --> 37:20.371
Addiction.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.540
Yeah, addiction, and I felt
like, you know,

37:22.607 --> 37:25.076
{\an8}you never know which way
the personalities will go.

37:25.142 --> 37:26.577
{\an8}He had, like,
a chemical imbalance,

37:26.644 --> 37:27.912
{\an8}so I just wouldn't know.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.647
Sometimes, with, being with T,

37:29.714 --> 37:31.616
I just didn't know, like,
everything could be calm

37:31.682 --> 37:33.017
and then she could get angry
and just--

37:33.084 --> 37:35.152
You know, it kind of scared me
a little bit.

37:35.219 --> 37:36.854
Moniece, do you feel like
Teairra has been making

37:36.921 --> 37:39.423
an effort to clean up since
this incident has happened?

37:39.490 --> 37:42.126
{\an1}Absolutely. Viewers
didn't get to see it,

37:42.193 --> 37:45.963
{\an7}but Teairra and myself
are very close.

37:46.030 --> 37:49.367
{\an1}You know, I've seen
a big change in Teairra.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.835
I mean, look at her.

37:50.901 --> 37:52.670
She's lost, like,
ten or 15 pounds.

37:52.737 --> 37:55.406
That shows you right there
that she stopped drinking.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.708
She looks amazing.

38:00.811 --> 38:02.913
{\an5}I wish you the best.

38:00.811 --> 38:02.913
Thank you.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.582
{\an1}I know you're gonna be
fighting a trial,

38:04.649 --> 38:06.417
but we're praying for you.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.185
{\an1}Hope that everything
turns out well for you.

38:08.252 --> 38:09.186
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

38:09.253 --> 38:10.621
(cheering)

38:10.688 --> 38:12.189
All right,
we've got to take a break,

38:12.256 --> 38:14.392
but when we return,
some Hollywood highlights

38:14.458 --> 38:15.559
in just a minute.

38:17.628 --> 38:20.231
{\an8}Is there any last words
that they would like to say

38:20.297 --> 38:21.465
{\an8}to any other members
of the cast?

38:21.532 --> 38:22.700
{\an8}(Safaree)
Hold on.

38:22.767 --> 38:24.735
{\an8}I think we need
to try something new.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.537
{\an8}Let's all--
Listen, listen...

38:26.604 --> 38:28.005
{\an8}(Nina)
All right, Safaree, Safaree...

38:28.072 --> 38:29.373
{\an8}You and that pet
need to sit down.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.985
Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood - The Reunion."

38:41.052 --> 38:43.487
All right, we're almost
out of time, but before we go,

38:43.554 --> 38:47.091
we want to take a look at some
of the season's best moments.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.225
Check it out.

38:48.292 --> 38:50.294
(laughing)

38:50.361 --> 38:52.763
Where the gut at?
Where the gut at?

38:52.830 --> 38:55.099
Check this out.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.034
{\an1}What you do?
Make me proud.

38:57.101 --> 38:59.170
I want it all.

38:59.236 --> 39:00.805
(whooping)

39:03.641 --> 39:04.575
(Safaree)
I want it all.

39:04.642 --> 39:06.911
Money, Brandus, money!

39:06.977 --> 39:08.345
Yip, yip, yip!

39:08.412 --> 39:09.747
I'm a bad bitch.

39:09.814 --> 39:11.549
(Safaree)
I want it all.

39:11.615 --> 39:13.784
A man like Daddy.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.219
{\an1}Lies on lies on lies on lies
on lies on lies.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.121
{\an1}You're not gonna tell him,
right?

39:17.188 --> 39:18.789
I hope she can keep my secret.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.591
Janky.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.593
I told Ray.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.593
No!

39:22.660 --> 39:24.028
(Safaree)
I want it all.

39:24.095 --> 39:27.031
{\an1}The only thing I want
from him is a vial of sperm.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.265
Right.

39:28.332 --> 39:29.600
What pregnancy?

39:29.667 --> 39:30.601
Are you serious?

39:30.668 --> 39:32.203
Abort, mother (bleep)!

39:32.269 --> 39:33.738
Abort!

39:33.804 --> 39:35.606
(Safaree)
I want it all.

39:39.176 --> 39:40.211
Woo, woo, woo!

39:40.277 --> 39:41.212
(Safaree)
I want it all.

39:46.784 --> 39:47.918
I want it all.

39:47.985 --> 39:49.186
Oh, I thought your (bleep)
got hard.

39:49.253 --> 39:50.221
I didn't know you got mad.

39:50.287 --> 39:52.490
Nnn!

39:52.556 --> 39:56.093
(laughter and applause)

39:57.661 --> 40:00.297
Safaree, what was your favorite
moment this season?

40:00.364 --> 40:02.633
With A1 and Lyrica's parents.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.135
Okay.

40:04.201 --> 40:06.504
It's that and the tow truck.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.505
That tow truck (bleep).

40:07.571 --> 40:09.106
{\an1}Oh, that--

40:09.173 --> 40:11.642
Yo, that (bleep)
was hilarious.

40:11.709 --> 40:13.811
Ray J, what was one of your
favorite moments of the season?

40:13.878 --> 40:16.213
Well, me getting married to my
wife, that was the whole thing.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.715
{\an3}Aww!

40:17.782 --> 40:20.050
Is there any last words
that they would like to say

40:20.117 --> 40:22.119
to any other members
of the cast?

40:22.186 --> 40:24.755
Max, you my brother,
I love you.

40:24.822 --> 40:27.091
We all young black men.
We need to stick together.

40:27.158 --> 40:30.060
That's what we gotta do.
They killing us out here.

40:30.127 --> 40:33.230
{\an1}We all we got,
at the end of the day.

40:33.297 --> 40:35.032
{\an1}So I appreciate all the fellas
being mature.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.300
(Ray J)
Let's all hang out tonight.

40:36.367 --> 40:37.535
Do positive things.

40:40.471 --> 40:42.139
{\an1}Do you think you
might ever be able

40:42.206 --> 40:44.575
{\an1}to bury the hatchet
with Moniece?

40:44.642 --> 40:47.077
To be honest with you,
all I think about

40:47.144 --> 40:51.081
{\an1}when you say that name is
what was said about my child,

40:51.148 --> 40:52.817
{\an5}so I'll leave it at that.

40:51.148 --> 40:52.817
Okay.

40:52.883 --> 40:56.320
Moniece, anything?

40:56.387 --> 40:58.823
Stand by everything
I've said thus far.

40:58.889 --> 41:01.025
{\an5}(audience murmuring)

40:58.889 --> 41:01.025
Okay.

41:01.091 --> 41:02.459
Nia.

41:02.526 --> 41:06.297
{\an1}Honestly, I think just
to all my female castmates,

41:06.363 --> 41:08.566
like, I really hope
we do better,

41:08.632 --> 41:12.603
as far as getting along,
real apologies.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.038
{\an3}Be grown.
That's it.

41:14.104 --> 41:15.039
All right.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.109
All right.
And that's all we have time for.

41:19.176 --> 41:20.578
Hey, hold on, hold on!

41:20.644 --> 41:23.814
{\an7}I think we need to try something
new that's never been done.

41:23.881 --> 41:25.883
{\an5}None of these, right?

41:23.881 --> 41:25.883
No group hug.

41:25.950 --> 41:27.351
{\an5}Ain't no group hugging.

41:25.950 --> 41:27.351
Listen, listen, listen...

41:27.418 --> 41:28.752
All right, Safaree.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.955
You and that pet
need to sit down.

41:31.021 --> 41:32.456
I wasn't gonna say
a group hug.

41:32.523 --> 41:35.559
I was, forget it.

41:35.626 --> 41:37.394
Y'all about to do
no kumbaya (bleep).

41:37.461 --> 41:38.662
We're still working on that.

41:38.729 --> 41:40.564
That's all we have time
for tonight.

41:40.631 --> 41:42.499
Thank you so much for tuning in.

41:42.566 --> 41:45.236
I'm your host, Nina Parker.
Good night.

41:45.302 --> 41:47.271
(cheering and applause)
