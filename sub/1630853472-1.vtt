00:07.416 --> 00:12.083
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

00:12.166 --> 00:16.375
five, four, three, two, one…

00:16.458 --> 00:20.166
Happy New Year!

00:30.333 --> 00:31.875
I love you, baby!

01:13.333 --> 01:14.875
Congratulations, baby! Huh?

01:14.958 --> 01:17.375
-Going to varsity.
-Yes, that's me.

01:17.458 --> 01:21.041
-When did you get the text?
-They've just sent it.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.458
-Let's get out of here.

01:25.541 --> 01:28.750
It might get
worse than it already is.

01:54.458 --> 01:56.833
Guys, he's scared!

02:01.791 --> 02:04.416
Happy!

02:54.458 --> 02:56.375
Mmm-mm!

03:04.583 --> 03:06.541
Mmm-mm!

03:15.958 --> 03:18.041
Huh-uh! Please stop!

03:18.125 --> 03:20.166
-Damn!

03:48.000 --> 03:50.375
Wow! Varsity.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.583
Aunt, I passed!

04:02.750 --> 04:05.041
I got three distinctions!
Can you believe it?

04:05.125 --> 04:06.125
Wow!

04:06.208 --> 04:08.291
Finally, I can get rid
of that school uniform.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.458
Oh! By the way, you need to send a
deposit along with my matric results.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.458
My girl.

04:16.541 --> 04:17.625
Isn't there a cheaper school

04:17.708 --> 04:19.916
Not this again, Aunty.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.958
I told you there is no better
school that offers a Degree in Acting.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.541
Acting again?

04:24.625 --> 04:27.666
But you said if I
pass you going to let me go.

04:27.750 --> 04:32.541
Yes, because I thought you'd
realise that there's no money in acting.

04:33.333 --> 04:35.750
Well, that's what I've chosen.

04:35.833 --> 04:37.666
Then that means
we have to move to plan B.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.125
But you've never
told me about plan B though.

04:39.208 --> 04:40.416
That's because I
didn't think we'd needed it…

04:40.500 --> 04:42.791
but the way you are carrying
on we will definitely need plan B.

04:42.875 --> 04:46.791
You remember that stokvel,
Hope of Glory that fell apart?

04:46.875 --> 04:47.875
Yes.

04:49.375 --> 04:54.875
Well I took all your varsity
savings and invested it there.

04:59.875 --> 05:01.083
I'm leaving.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.666
Aunt, you took my tuition money
and invested it in Hope of Glory!

05:11.750 --> 05:13.041
Who does that!

05:13.125 --> 05:14.083
Kedibone!

05:14.166 --> 05:16.541
I was hoping for a great
return on my investment

05:16.625 --> 05:19.208
so I could give this house a
facelift and also pay for your tuition.

05:19.291 --> 05:22.458
Okay, now how will I go to
university if there's no money?

05:22.541 --> 05:25.333
Are you saying I should
stay at home the whole year?

05:25.416 --> 05:26.625
Am I homebound doing nothing?

05:26.708 --> 05:28.791
I've been working at
Checkers for 16 years.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.041
I spoke with my manager

05:30.125 --> 05:32.375
and he said I should bring your
CV and you can start working.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.500
Me?

05:34.583 --> 05:35.666
Work at Checkers?

05:35.750 --> 05:38.791
If you start now, you'll have a huge
pension fund by the time you retire.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.041
That's not going to happen.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.500
I'm not going to work at Checkers!

05:43.583 --> 05:45.041
Kedibone!

05:45.125 --> 05:46.666
Stop acting like a spoilt child.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.125
You know the situation.

05:48.208 --> 05:50.458
There is no money. It's gone!

05:50.541 --> 05:51.958
My goodness! Huh-uh!

05:53.500 --> 05:54.500
Really!

06:02.833 --> 06:04.291
Argh! Uh!

07:00.166 --> 07:02.125
You know sometimes
I wish my mom was here.

07:02.208 --> 07:04.083
Coz I wouldn't be
going through all of this.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.125
Like… I just want to study, baby.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.333
I don't want to be a statistic,

07:07.416 --> 07:08.375
I want to leave the township

07:08.458 --> 07:10.125
and just further my studies.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.791
-Baby.

07:16.875 --> 07:17.875
Listen…

07:17.958 --> 07:19.708
You will go to varsity. Okay?

07:20.375 --> 07:22.500
-Hey?

07:23.291 --> 07:25.291
You seem to forget that I
can make anything happen.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.625
Look… I never want to see you cry, baby.

07:27.708 --> 07:28.750
Understand?

07:28.833 --> 07:32.375
Just trust me and all will be fine.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.416
I need this
student loan, please!

07:42.500 --> 07:44.291
-My sister.
-It's a bit too late, hey.

07:44.375 --> 07:45.708
I can't help you.

07:45.791 --> 07:47.583
I know, but I really need your help…

07:47.666 --> 07:49.916
-I can't afford to take a gap year.
-It's already too late.

07:58.291 --> 08:02.666
<i>I'd kill to have</i>
<i>a car like this, bra. Eish!</i>

08:03.750 --> 08:06.208
<i>-Cool!</i>
<i>-Cool!</i>

08:10.541 --> 08:12.458
<i>There's no jitter here, do you hear.</i>

08:12.541 --> 08:14.875
<i>Because it's a German machine.</i>

08:22.958 --> 08:26.083
<i>Your dad left</i>
<i>you a good inheritance, hey!</i>

08:26.166 --> 08:28.625
<i>Convertible! Coupe. Woah!</i>

08:31.416 --> 08:33.375
<i>I just wannt study, baby.</i>

08:34.666 --> 08:36.458
<i>You will go to varsity. Okay?</i>

09:16.083 --> 09:18.625
I am totally going to beat you.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.333
There! Take that!

09:22.750 --> 09:24.333
Hey, Mrembula.

09:25.708 --> 09:26.875
What's up, buddy?

09:29.208 --> 09:31.583
Hah! Take that!

09:31.666 --> 09:33.166
Mrembula…

09:33.250 --> 09:34.291
What's up, brother?

09:37.125 --> 09:38.208
I sold my car.

09:42.791 --> 09:43.958
I had to, man.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.583
Kedibone…

09:49.666 --> 09:51.375
varsity…

09:54.791 --> 09:57.208
Mrembula, are you
telling me that you sold your car?

09:58.208 --> 09:59.250
Because of a girl?

10:00.083 --> 10:01.125
Huh?

10:01.208 --> 10:04.791
Mrembula sold
the car that his father gave him?

10:05.416 --> 10:07.583
The whole BMW 325i is gone.

10:07.666 --> 10:09.333
How much did you sell it for?

10:09.416 --> 10:11.333
-Twenty five.
-What!

10:12.250 --> 10:13.666
Twenty five thousand?

10:13.750 --> 10:14.916
Have you lost your mind?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Huh!

10:16.083 --> 10:18.958
You're telling me you sold your
whole inheritance for Kedibone…

10:19.041 --> 10:20.125
for R25,000?

10:20.208 --> 10:21.416
You know what that car is?

10:21.500 --> 10:23.041
That's a classic.

10:23.125 --> 10:27.375
You and Mrembula are
couple goals.

10:27.458 --> 10:28.541
You're my role model.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.333
Themba… sell his car?

10:30.416 --> 10:32.916
-He would never do that for me.
-Bottom line, we're going to varsity.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.666
Yes! First years. First years.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.541
How much do you still need?

10:44.583 --> 10:46.083
Ten thousand…

10:46.166 --> 10:47.208
Okay, listen…

10:47.291 --> 10:49.000
Mrembula said he'd give me R25,000.

10:49.083 --> 10:52.333
So, I will give you R5,0000
and we will both be short.

10:52.958 --> 10:54.166
Kedi…

10:54.750 --> 10:56.250
-Are you being for real?
-Yes.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.208
Kedi!

10:58.291 --> 11:00.458
Oh…! Kedi!

11:01.625 --> 11:02.916
This is the
car I was telling you about.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.625
We call it Rosary.

11:05.583 --> 11:06.458
Rosary?

11:06.541 --> 11:08.375
Yeah, you know that thing…

11:08.458 --> 11:09.583
Mother Theresa?

11:10.625 --> 11:12.958
Say a short
prayer and it'll get you to work.

11:15.666 --> 11:16.750
You see?

11:16.833 --> 11:17.958
Here's the key.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.375
If you fix it…

11:19.458 --> 11:20.708
you can drive it.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.416
Are we good?
Yeah. Thank you.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.083
Sure!

11:30.125 --> 11:31.458
Mrembula bro…

11:31.541 --> 11:32.583
Look at this!

11:32.666 --> 11:33.916
Hey! What's all this?

11:34.791 --> 11:37.625
I'm tired of being friends with
guys who can't think with their heads.

11:37.708 --> 11:39.166
Go to hell!

11:39.250 --> 11:41.291
Can you fix this car or not?

11:41.375 --> 11:43.125
Yeah, the starter
just needs a bit of attention.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.416
Well then stop complaining.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.875
Friends like
you are draining, bro!

11:49.625 --> 11:51.166
From a BMW to this!

11:51.250 --> 11:52.625
Just stop right here.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.416
Right here.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.375
Yoh, Babe! This feels like a dream.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.708
--I don't
know what I'd do without you.

12:20.791 --> 12:21.958
Don't worry about it.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.208
As long as we're happy.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.166
Calm and relaxed… I'm happy.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.125
Yeah but baby, you didn't
have to sell your father's car.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.750
Don't worry about it, baby.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.083
We sold that car for a good cause.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.666
Look where you are now?

12:34.541 --> 12:36.916
But baby… this one is so old.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.083
-What?

12:38.166 --> 12:41.041
Which car? This one? This is Rosary.

12:41.125 --> 12:43.791
Give me two months with this car.

12:43.875 --> 12:46.041
You'll see when I pull up in here.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.416
-I'll show them flames.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.291
You will even get new friends.

12:49.375 --> 12:51.000
-And besides…

12:51.083 --> 12:53.500
I'm getting a Lamborghini
with your first paycheck.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.958
-With my paycheck?
-Yes.

12:57.458 --> 12:58.583
Thank you.

12:59.625 --> 13:00.791
I love you.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.458
-I'll call you.

13:09.916 --> 13:11.166
Baby…

13:11.250 --> 13:12.333
-You must drive safe.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.500
Love you.

13:21.958 --> 13:22.958
Babe!

13:25.666 --> 13:26.583
Babe!

13:37.625 --> 13:41.458
My sister relax. Gents, let's help.

13:41.541 --> 13:43.541
Don't worry. We got this.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.041
-Let's go, king.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.125
Ah!

14:27.500 --> 14:28.916
Let's go.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.541
Where did that lady say
we are supposed to leave the trays?

14:37.625 --> 14:38.791
Um…

14:38.875 --> 14:40.375
I think there where it says 'Out'.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.458
Right there.

14:41.541 --> 14:43.041
By the conveyor belts?

14:43.125 --> 14:44.666
Yoh, friend!

14:44.750 --> 14:46.916
-It's like a dream.

14:49.458 --> 14:50.625
-Yoh!

14:50.708 --> 14:51.958
Why is it doing that?

14:53.916 --> 14:55.416
Okay…

14:55.500 --> 14:58.083
They go in there to get washed? Yoh!

14:58.958 --> 15:00.041
Mmm!

15:03.750 --> 15:04.750
What's wrong?

15:07.083 --> 15:08.083
<i>Eish</i>…

15:09.250 --> 15:10.916
It's just that, like…

15:11.541 --> 15:16.083
I'm happy being here but at
the same time, I'm pregnant.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.250
I mean, I am going to show soon…

15:19.333 --> 15:20.625
and we eat a lot…

15:20.708 --> 15:23.583
You'll be fine, don't even worry about it…

15:28.208 --> 15:29.541
Oh, don't stress about it.

15:29.625 --> 15:30.875
Are you still my best friend?

15:30.958 --> 15:33.000
Of course. Best friend.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.875
That's my best friend.

15:34.958 --> 15:36.875
Cute… Who are you?

15:36.958 --> 15:38.250
Look at her hair, that poofy thing.

15:38.333 --> 15:39.541
Who did that?

15:39.625 --> 15:41.208
It's Neo from Zone 6 in Diepkloof.

15:41.291 --> 15:44.083
So, are you telling me
that's your actual hair?

15:44.166 --> 15:45.208
-No…
-Yeah.

15:45.291 --> 15:48.958
They crotched her and
added extensions plus a wig.

15:49.041 --> 15:50.333
Okay, wait, guys.

15:50.416 --> 15:53.666
Are you telling me that total
nobodies just joined this conversation?

15:53.750 --> 15:54.750
How is this any of your business?

15:54.833 --> 15:56.666
You don't know me,
right? You don't know me?

15:58.833 --> 16:01.083
You… tell me… where you from?

16:01.791 --> 16:02.916
I'm from Soweto.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.791
How are you this pretty
and you come from there?

16:06.375 --> 16:07.291
Yes?

16:07.375 --> 16:09.500
Right? Because there are
no beautiful girls in Soweto?

16:09.583 --> 16:11.083
Hold on, guys!

16:11.166 --> 16:13.541
Is someone gonna shut this
bitch up because she's been talkin--

16:13.625 --> 16:14.875
Okay!

16:14.958 --> 16:16.291
Jeez, guys.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.291
So, are you First years?

16:20.708 --> 16:22.583
Yeah… and you?

16:22.666 --> 16:24.666
Do we look
like First years, doll?

16:25.333 --> 16:26.625
I'm sorry.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.541
Be careful of
the Fuck boys on campus,

16:29.625 --> 16:31.125
they're a little tricky.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.166
I like you.

16:35.250 --> 16:36.583
We'll see you around.

16:37.458 --> 16:38.583
Bye.

16:45.541 --> 16:47.500
Why are you defending
them? They're not your friends.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.000
Yes, but you don't know them either.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.083
Did you come with them?
You also don't know them.

16:53.666 --> 16:54.625
Let's go.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.375
Let's go!

16:56.458 --> 16:59.500
When I try
to start the car… nothing.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.458
So I ask Kedibone to
help so I can kick start.

17:02.541 --> 17:04.500
Just before she starts to push…

17:04.583 --> 17:07.083
some guys came to the rescue.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.375
Come on, bro!

17:08.458 --> 17:11.250
Doesn't she use this car as her Uber?

17:11.333 --> 17:14.458
So if you have to kick
start, she must push.

17:14.541 --> 17:16.333
-Huh-uh. Push?
-Yeah.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.500
No man, c'mon.

17:18.583 --> 17:21.041
Mrembula there's one thing
I don't understand about you.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.333
How can you…

17:23.125 --> 17:27.791
give up your whole inheritance for
a girl you haven't even slept with?

17:27.875 --> 17:30.041
Not once. Not even once!

17:30.125 --> 17:31.916
Msithi, don't talk shit.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.833
You know very well I'm
waiting for her to turn 21…

17:36.916 --> 17:38.541
then I can deflower her!

17:38.625 --> 17:40.791
Why do you act like you
don't know what the deal is?

17:43.833 --> 17:46.083
When she turns 21? Yeah.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.458
What if you die before then?

17:48.541 --> 17:49.500
Should I…

17:49.583 --> 17:51.083
deflower her for you?

17:51.166 --> 17:54.708
-Three thousand… per month.

17:54.791 --> 17:56.875
-So expensive.
-R1,500 a month?

17:56.958 --> 17:59.541
-Where are we going to get this money?
-Buy airtime. We need to call them.

17:59.625 --> 18:03.750
To go and see them
requires taxi money and…

18:03.833 --> 18:04.916
Hello…

18:06.041 --> 18:07.041
-Hello.
-Hi.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.708
I overheard you are
looking for accommodation.

18:10.375 --> 18:11.291
Hi.

18:12.333 --> 18:13.333
Are you a student?

18:13.416 --> 18:14.416
No, I used to be.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.625
But now, I am an acting lecturer.

18:16.708 --> 18:18.500
Oh, Acting? Me too.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.208
-I am a First Year student.
-Seriously?

18:20.291 --> 18:21.750
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:21.833 --> 18:23.250
A young Thespian. Huh?

18:23.333 --> 18:24.250
Lesbian?

18:24.333 --> 18:26.041
-No. Thespian.
-Thespian!

18:26.125 --> 18:29.333
I can already see you transforming
into the different characters…

18:29.416 --> 18:32.041
and bringing light and shade
and dynamics to the roles.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.791
-You go Thespian!

18:33.875 --> 18:35.666
Yeah. That's fantastic!

18:36.708 --> 18:38.166
So, where do you stay?

18:38.250 --> 18:40.875
Um… for now we stay at home.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.916
Yeah. We don't have
enough money to pay for res.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.583
Oh…and these ones are expensive.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.208
These are all just
exploitation of the African child.

18:50.291 --> 18:51.333
Huh?

18:51.416 --> 18:53.666
My friend owns the Bannister Hotel.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.916
Next to it, there's free accommodation.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.166
Free?

18:57.250 --> 18:58.333
It's like a backpackers.

18:58.416 --> 18:59.333
-What is a backpackers?
-Backpackers?

18:59.416 --> 19:01.208
I can show you if you want.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.625
Yes.

19:21.708 --> 19:22.916
Here it is, ladies.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.208
Come in.

19:31.583 --> 19:33.875
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.000
No man!

19:37.083 --> 19:38.458
Why aren't there any windows?

19:38.541 --> 19:42.208
You know living in the city is expensive.

19:42.291 --> 19:45.166
Okay look, if someone moves out,
you will get one of the other rooms.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.250
Woah!

19:46.333 --> 19:47.708
And who's underwear is this?

19:48.666 --> 19:50.833
Ah… these underpants?

19:50.916 --> 19:52.666
Let me move them.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.500
Um… Yeah.

19:56.958 --> 19:59.500
-I can help you get settled--
-No, thanks.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.125
Please give us a moment…

20:01.208 --> 20:03.458
to… um, to…

20:03.541 --> 20:05.291
to discuss this.

20:11.125 --> 20:12.458
Oh, you want…

20:12.541 --> 20:14.125
-some privacy? Okay.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.208
Okay…

20:15.291 --> 20:16.833
I'll see you around then.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.166
-Ah!

20:53.375 --> 20:54.750
Woah!

20:54.833 --> 20:56.791
Friend, you're so extra.

20:56.875 --> 21:00.291
It's my birthday week.
What do you want from me?

21:01.750 --> 21:03.250
Ah, I'm gonna get so drunk.

21:04.708 --> 21:07.291
Anyways, let's toast to
being fabulous.

21:07.375 --> 21:08.875
No! Toast to me…

21:08.958 --> 21:10.708
This is about me. Why the fuck
would we toast to anything else?

21:10.791 --> 21:13.208
-Okay, okay, we'll have it your way.
-Yeah!

21:13.291 --> 21:15.375
And I'm not going to serve them

21:15.458 --> 21:19.041
because they think they are
better than anyone from Soweto.

21:19.125 --> 21:21.458
Ha! Why are you being so negative?

21:21.541 --> 21:23.250
I'm sure they tip well
with all that money.

21:23.333 --> 21:24.708
Their table is yours then.

21:24.791 --> 21:27.166
-And we'll share whatever they tip you.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.875
-Babes, it's my dad.

21:29.958 --> 21:31.791
-He's on his way.
-Okay.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.041
Hi Franco.

21:44.208 --> 21:45.333
Let me help.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.375
-You're going to be fine.

21:48.416 --> 21:49.541
Hey!

21:49.625 --> 21:50.833
-Hey.
-How's it going?

21:50.916 --> 21:52.791
-How are you?
-Sharp. Where's my daughter?

21:52.875 --> 21:54.666
Um… she just quickly
rushed to the bathroom.

21:54.750 --> 21:55.958
She's not feeling well.

21:57.958 --> 21:59.458
You drink girls drink a lot.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.541
-Daddy.
-Hi, baby.

22:01.625 --> 22:03.416
My little dolphin.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.125
Ah, dolphin.

22:05.208 --> 22:06.500
Are you okay?

22:07.208 --> 22:08.708
I don't feel well.

22:08.791 --> 22:10.250
Here, have some water.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.708
Yeah, drink.

22:16.791 --> 22:18.541
Daddy, I want you to meet my new friend.

22:18.625 --> 22:19.833
She saved me!

22:20.500 --> 22:21.958
Oh, it's the girl with the pretty hair.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.250
I think you need to go home now, dolphin.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.083
Amanda, please come
and take her to the car.

22:27.166 --> 22:30.375
Make sure Njabulo takes
you home, he's in the car.

22:30.458 --> 22:31.916
Take her bag and everything.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.500
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.625
You must stop drinking
too much, baby girl.

22:36.708 --> 22:38.666
You're so funny.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.208
-Let me get the bi--
-I have to…

22:40.291 --> 22:43.083
I really want to thank you
for saving my little dolphin.

22:43.166 --> 22:44.166
Argh, it's not a problem.

22:44.250 --> 22:45.875
She just wasn't feeling well. That's all.

22:46.583 --> 22:48.166
Has anyone ever told
how beautiful you are?

22:49.125 --> 22:50.125
No…

22:50.208 --> 22:51.750
But thank you… Sir.

22:51.833 --> 22:53.166
Huh-uh. Call me Franco.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.625
Sorry.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.208
Ah! You don't have to be sorry.

22:56.958 --> 23:00.458
The person who has to be sorry is
the one who made this gorgeous…

23:00.541 --> 23:03.541
beautiful, stunning
paragon of human perfection.

23:03.625 --> 23:05.583
Huh? Clean after drunks.

23:05.666 --> 23:07.208
No, no, no. I need his address.

23:07.291 --> 23:10.250
I want to find where he stays.
I want to know his parents.

23:10.333 --> 23:15.166
-I will deal with him. Huh?
-You're so funny.

23:15.250 --> 23:18.125
-What is your name?
-Uh… Kedibone.

23:19.250 --> 23:21.083
Can I call you crayfish?

23:21.958 --> 23:23.666
Uh… okay…

23:23.750 --> 23:25.333
Let me get the bill.

23:26.166 --> 23:27.416
Crayfish…

23:29.916 --> 23:32.041
-I owe you one.

23:34.708 --> 23:37.833
Three, two, one. Tada!

23:41.375 --> 23:43.291
Daddy, you got me a car!

23:43.375 --> 23:45.750
-Mmm?

23:45.833 --> 23:49.250
Crayfish, come.
Come celebrate with your friend.

23:49.333 --> 23:51.000
We'll catch up at lunch, okay?

23:52.583 --> 23:53.958
Great.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.958
I got a car!

24:00.083 --> 24:01.708
-How about we ditch school?
-Yes!

24:01.791 --> 24:04.458
-And we go shopping.
-Yeess!

24:04.541 --> 24:06.375
But I have class soon.

24:06.458 --> 24:10.916
Dude, dude, it's Monday.
Everyone in there is hung over. Let's go!

24:12.666 --> 24:14.375
Okay, but I'm broke.

24:14.458 --> 24:17.083
Don't worry. It's on me. Come on!

24:17.166 --> 24:19.625
It's my treat. Let's go.
I'll pay for everything.

24:20.666 --> 24:23.250
-Dolphin's got a car!
-I've got a car!

24:23.333 --> 24:24.875
Let's go, baby. Let's go, Crayfish.

24:24.958 --> 24:26.625
-Friend, come!

24:26.708 --> 24:28.291
Uh-uh… you stay.

24:28.375 --> 24:31.041
Go to school. School is cool.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.166
Beautiful girls.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.208
Okay, so let's get back to this.

24:57.291 --> 24:59.250
When you say virgin…

24:59.333 --> 25:00.791
you mean like virgin?

25:00.875 --> 25:02.208
Virgin, virgin?

25:02.291 --> 25:03.333
Yeah…

25:03.416 --> 25:05.041
Like never used a tampon, virgin.

25:06.250 --> 25:08.458
Girl, do you know what
your vagina looks like?

25:08.541 --> 25:09.583
Yeah.

25:09.666 --> 25:12.166
Does your man know
what your vagina looks like?

25:15.500 --> 25:16.666
Yeah, but…

25:17.291 --> 25:18.916
I am waiting until I turn 21.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.916
That's cute.

25:22.041 --> 25:23.583
Let me tell you about my first time.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.500
It was super romantic.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.458
There were flowers, champagne.

25:28.541 --> 25:30.625
His parents are super rich, obviously so…

25:30.708 --> 25:32.750
He booked us out this hotel room.

25:32.833 --> 25:34.583
The sex itself was terrible.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.458
But the experience was just wonderful.

25:36.541 --> 25:37.750
Okay and…

25:37.833 --> 25:39.375
What does sex feel like?

25:39.458 --> 25:40.875
Sex is amazing!

25:40.958 --> 25:42.458
Sex is like…

25:42.541 --> 25:45.750
it's like God floating down
from the heavens on a cloud

25:45.833 --> 25:48.708
and whispering sweet
sensations into your ear.

25:49.666 --> 25:50.958
But most guys…

25:51.041 --> 25:53.083
Most guys don't know how
to make you come so, girl,

25:53.166 --> 25:57.625
you gotta get on that dick and
grind and you grind and you grind!

25:57.708 --> 25:59.541
I swear, it'll be amazing.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.708
<i>Eish</i>! That sounds…

26:02.375 --> 26:03.916
Sounds… rough.

26:04.583 --> 26:05.833
You know what.

26:05.916 --> 26:07.083
My first time…

26:07.166 --> 26:08.916
I know Mrembula is a very gentle guy.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.625
-Hmm-mm.
-So he's gonna…

26:10.708 --> 26:12.208
kiss me.

26:12.916 --> 26:14.583
And he's gonna unbutton my shirt.

26:14.666 --> 26:16.041
Uh-huh!

26:16.125 --> 26:17.625
And he's gonna suck on my titties.

26:17.708 --> 26:21.000
Geez, you've got this thing
down to like, every clothing item.

26:21.708 --> 26:23.291
And then he is gonna…

26:24.291 --> 26:25.416
Put his penis inside your vagina.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.625
I'm tired of swimming.

26:50.083 --> 26:51.250
I need to go home now.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.583
Thank you so much for everything.

26:52.666 --> 26:54.083
I will take you home.

26:54.166 --> 26:55.250
If you don't mind.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.500
Okay.

26:57.583 --> 26:58.625
Thank you.

26:58.708 --> 27:00.708
Let's go. You'll be safe. Trust me.

27:37.708 --> 27:39.166
Ah… Crayfish.

27:39.833 --> 27:40.958
So…

27:41.041 --> 27:42.041
this is it?

27:42.125 --> 27:43.125
Yeah.

27:43.208 --> 27:44.708
It's way smaller than your mansion.

27:44.791 --> 27:46.791
You don't
have to be embarrassed.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.250
You have a roof over your head.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.416
Yes, but one day…

27:49.500 --> 27:51.708
You know, I'm gonna buy
myself a life away from this place.

27:51.791 --> 27:54.708
And you know what that day
could be much sooner than you think.

27:54.791 --> 27:57.333
-What do you mean?
-I want us to be special friends

27:57.416 --> 27:58.791
and have a special friendship.

28:00.916 --> 28:01.958
Franco…

28:02.041 --> 28:03.708
What exactly do you want?

28:04.500 --> 28:06.500
You know what, close your eyes.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.541
Close your eyes.

28:08.625 --> 28:09.708
Just wait!

28:10.458 --> 28:12.250
Patience. Patience. Patience.

28:14.708 --> 28:16.583
Don't open your eyes yet.

28:20.750 --> 28:22.250
And now, open…

28:28.916 --> 28:30.291
What's this?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.458
Possibilities.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.541
Here…

28:36.791 --> 28:38.583
It's yours. Take it.

28:40.625 --> 28:42.416
-Uh, Franco, no I… I can't.
-No, no, no.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.875
You can't be rude. Don't be rude.

28:45.041 --> 28:46.541
It's a gift. It's yours.

28:52.375 --> 28:53.833
Ahh…

28:57.583 --> 28:58.750
Yeah…

29:00.125 --> 29:01.916
Spend it however you like.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.875
Do your hair, your nails, the works…

29:05.500 --> 29:06.541
Have fun with it.

29:07.333 --> 29:08.333
Okay?

29:09.833 --> 29:10.833
Later.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.458
Jesus Christ!

29:24.458 --> 29:25.458
Woah!

29:32.375 --> 29:33.541
Beauty.

29:44.333 --> 29:45.416
What is this?

29:45.500 --> 29:46.541
It's a phone.

29:47.125 --> 29:48.458
Yeah but…

29:49.083 --> 29:50.541
I've got a phone.

29:50.625 --> 29:51.791
Yeah, I bought it for you.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.416
I already have a phone and it works fine.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.916
Huh-uh! This one is also yours. Huh?

29:59.083 --> 30:00.166
One more thing…

30:03.500 --> 30:04.791
I won a cellphone.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.041
You gotta be kidding me!

30:11.791 --> 30:14.458
You won a cellphone, just like that?

30:14.541 --> 30:15.750
No way!

30:15.833 --> 30:18.041
-Congrats, baby.
-Thank you, baby.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.583
Actually,
I want you to have it.

30:20.666 --> 30:22.875
There we go, there we go!

30:24.000 --> 30:25.416
Beauty.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.041
Go for it, go for it, go for it!

30:27.791 --> 30:29.958
Ah, this palette is so amazing!

30:30.041 --> 30:31.541
I should have gotten one as well.

30:31.625 --> 30:33.625
And these colours are gonna
look so good on your skin.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.833
Fuck it, you are beautiful!

30:36.916 --> 30:38.333
Like I forget and then I
look at you, I'm just like,

30:38.416 --> 30:39.666
"Oh my God, you're beautiful."

30:39.750 --> 30:41.083
And can I tell you something?

30:41.166 --> 30:43.000
Rich people love beautiful shit.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.833
Beautiful cars, beautiful houses.

30:45.916 --> 30:47.916
Beautiful fish. Great.

30:48.541 --> 30:49.750
Fantastic.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.166
I swear to God, Kedi…

30:52.250 --> 30:53.750
with that face…

30:53.833 --> 30:55.708
You'll have the rich falling over you.

30:55.791 --> 30:57.541
Opening every door for you.

30:58.416 --> 31:00.000
Will snatch that face…

31:00.583 --> 31:02.291
get you a good weave.

31:02.375 --> 31:04.375
Don't do that. That doesn't look classy.

31:04.458 --> 31:05.500
Afterall…

31:05.583 --> 31:07.083
I want to get you a rich man.

31:07.875 --> 31:09.083
Take you out of poverty.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.041
Woah!

31:33.083 --> 31:35.000
Comrades are really funny, hey.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.875
Seriously man, I'm telling you.

31:36.958 --> 31:38.541
If the tender is for R200 million…

31:39.208 --> 31:41.250
and Mbaks wants R50 million…

31:41.333 --> 31:43.708
give it to him.

31:43.791 --> 31:44.916
Just give it to him.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.666
How else are you going
to get the next tender.

31:48.375 --> 31:49.791
Hey, cheers guys!

31:49.875 --> 31:51.541
-Cheers!

31:51.625 --> 31:54.750
-All the best.
-Oh, politicians are very funny.

31:54.833 --> 31:56.833
Oh, they are very funny.

32:01.416 --> 32:03.583
-Hello, Bra D.
-Hello.

32:03.666 --> 32:05.500
Quick word with you?

32:05.583 --> 32:07.458
Sure. What's wrong?

32:08.250 --> 32:09.250
Uh…

32:09.333 --> 32:11.541
Bra D, I wanted to know if…

32:12.166 --> 32:14.125
anyone has off days

32:14.208 --> 32:16.375
so I could work during that period?

32:16.458 --> 32:17.916
You want to work overtime again?

32:18.583 --> 32:20.125
Yeah, I need it Bra D.

32:20.791 --> 32:22.541
Your dad used to say the same thing.

32:22.625 --> 32:24.458
"I really need this overtime."

32:24.541 --> 32:26.166
And when I warned him
about overworking himself…

32:26.250 --> 32:28.375
He said one day, he would buy this place.

32:28.458 --> 32:29.375
Is that why?

32:29.458 --> 32:31.375
Ah… No. Bra D.

32:31.458 --> 32:33.291
Bra D, I'm saving up for lobola.

32:33.958 --> 32:35.041
Huh?

32:36.833 --> 32:37.875
You want to get married?

32:37.958 --> 32:39.083
Yes, I do.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.958
Oh my boy…

32:41.625 --> 32:42.791
That's a beautiful thing.

32:43.458 --> 32:44.833
You can work the extra hours.

32:44.916 --> 32:47.416
Just make sure you don't break your back.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.458
Remember, after the wedding,

32:49.541 --> 32:51.833
you still need to consummate the marriage.

32:53.583 --> 32:55.166
-I hear you Bra D.
-You know what I'm talking about?

32:55.250 --> 32:56.583
Bra D…

32:56.666 --> 32:59.000
-Thank you Bra D.
-Do you have the experience?

33:08.666 --> 33:10.458
I need to
go and fetch this car part

33:10.541 --> 33:12.000
that Msithi's been nagging me about.

33:12.083 --> 33:13.375
Okay.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.791
Thank you.

33:15.791 --> 33:17.541
-So…

33:20.625 --> 33:22.333
I swear to
God, I am gonna tag you.

33:22.416 --> 33:24.291
Two thousand likes by
the end of the day, darling.

33:24.375 --> 33:25.291
I promise!

33:25.375 --> 33:26.666
Okay? Average.

33:29.541 --> 33:30.708
Hey, Kedi…

33:30.791 --> 33:32.458
Is that not your friend?

33:32.541 --> 33:34.458
-Can you see your likes?

33:34.541 --> 33:36.750
Come… see your likes.

33:37.625 --> 33:40.958
That is a beautiful
picture. It's pretty.

33:41.041 --> 33:44.333
So… who has to come
up first and show us something?

33:46.750 --> 33:48.416
Kedibone.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.958
Why don't you come up?
Let's show them something.

33:53.708 --> 33:55.458
So we sit down.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.791
We lock our toes.

33:59.833 --> 34:01.000
And we lock our hands.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.500
And we lock our eyes.

34:09.583 --> 34:10.833
And on my count…

34:10.916 --> 34:12.375
One…

34:12.458 --> 34:13.833
Two…

34:13.916 --> 34:14.916
Three…

34:17.666 --> 34:20.875
Let me not into the
marriage of true minds.

34:20.958 --> 34:22.958
Admit impediments.

34:23.041 --> 34:27.041
We tried our best but
you're not forgiving us.

34:27.125 --> 34:29.625
Love does not insist in its own way.

34:29.708 --> 34:31.375
Your name is Martha

34:31.458 --> 34:33.833
and you will work in that factory
for a duration of six months.

34:33.916 --> 34:35.833
After which you will
pack all your belongings

34:35.916 --> 34:38.583
and go back to those
very valleys and mountains,

34:38.666 --> 34:41.541
where you will be greeted
by smiles and giggles.

34:43.125 --> 34:45.416
From the children you've
left for a whole six months.

34:48.125 --> 34:49.958
And they will be expecting gifts from…

34:51.083 --> 34:52.625
from that Johannesburg.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.583
But as you step onto your doorstep…

34:58.125 --> 35:01.666
you realise that all those gifts that
were promised by Johannesburg…

35:03.125 --> 35:04.666
were intangible.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.833
That's it.
That's it Kedi. Well done!

35:21.625 --> 35:22.625
Nice one.

35:23.375 --> 35:25.291
Rise of the African child.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.041
Good. Okay, I'll
see you guys next week.

35:27.958 --> 35:29.875
-Alright, have a good one.
-Bye, Sir.

35:29.958 --> 35:31.166
Kedibone…

35:31.250 --> 35:32.583
May I have a word with you.

35:35.708 --> 35:37.291
I was wondering if…

35:37.375 --> 35:38.875
-I can meet you in the dressing room…

35:39.666 --> 35:41.083
Once you've gotten your things.

35:41.166 --> 35:43.583
Just something that I
wanna talk to you about.

35:43.666 --> 35:45.041
Okay… um…

35:45.125 --> 35:46.208
-Dressing room… I'll see you there.

35:46.291 --> 35:47.375
Okay. It's this side.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.708
Hi, Franco…

35:56.875 --> 35:58.875
Yeah. I know, I know.

35:59.875 --> 36:01.458
Can I just call you later?

36:02.958 --> 36:03.958
Bye.

36:08.916 --> 36:11.000
Rise of the African Child.

36:12.791 --> 36:14.291
It's a big play, you know.

36:15.166 --> 36:17.166
It's important to us Africans.

36:18.250 --> 36:19.875
And Kedibone…

36:20.583 --> 36:22.500
you're perfect for this role.

36:22.583 --> 36:24.291
It's as if it was written for you.

36:25.916 --> 36:26.916
You'll see.

36:28.041 --> 36:29.458
It's going to be wonderful.

36:31.333 --> 36:32.416
You're perfect.

36:33.916 --> 36:35.416
Just perfect.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.375
So, aren't we talking anymore?

37:12.583 --> 37:13.958
-Friend…
-No!

37:14.041 --> 37:16.875
Don't "friend"
me. I can't get hold of you.

37:16.958 --> 37:20.958
When I call, you don't answer
'cause you're busy with Franco…

37:33.666 --> 37:35.666
Wait, let me get my phone.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.708
I'm good, right?

37:56.208 --> 37:57.291
I'm good.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.375
I'm good.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.083
I think need the gym.

38:03.166 --> 38:04.833
I must get a personal trainer.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.541
And you could be the one.

38:06.625 --> 38:07.875
-Me? -Yes.

38:07.958 --> 38:09.541
-I wish. Yoh!
-I'm telling you.

38:10.583 --> 38:11.583
I'll pay you.

38:18.208 --> 38:19.208
Look at that.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.041
Huh?

38:25.500 --> 38:26.666
Yes…

38:26.750 --> 38:27.875
There we go.

38:27.958 --> 38:28.958
Thank you.

38:29.791 --> 38:31.083
No, thank you.

38:31.625 --> 38:33.750
-For being a good friend.

38:37.666 --> 38:38.666
It's okay.

38:40.416 --> 38:41.375
I'll wait.

38:41.958 --> 38:43.333
I'm a patient man.

38:44.083 --> 38:45.083
Huh?

38:46.166 --> 38:47.166
Take care.

38:47.250 --> 38:48.250
Yeah.

38:48.875 --> 38:50.291
-Okay.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.125
The old man is exhausted!

38:52.208 --> 38:54.625
-I need to go now.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.291
-Look after yourself okay.
-Okay.

38:57.875 --> 38:59.000
Have fun.

38:59.708 --> 39:00.708
Enjoy it.

39:00.791 --> 39:02.833
-Thank you.

39:07.166 --> 39:08.125
Alright…

39:08.916 --> 39:10.041
What's up, Crayfish!

39:10.791 --> 39:13.250
Woah!

39:14.000 --> 39:15.833
Hey, hey, hey!

39:15.916 --> 39:17.416
Yoh!

39:18.041 --> 39:20.458
We're celebrating,
because I found an agency.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.500
-Mmm-hm.
-Agency?

39:22.583 --> 39:23.916
Mmm-hm, acting agency.

39:24.583 --> 39:25.833
Oh okay, so…

39:26.416 --> 39:28.166
Those people who send you…

39:29.125 --> 39:30.666
-To television stations?
-To auditions.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.125
-Yeah…
-And then they're are going to tell you

39:32.208 --> 39:33.875
if you got the gig. Those type of things.

39:33.958 --> 39:36.083
-Okay. Okay.

39:36.166 --> 39:37.375
Got you.

39:44.333 --> 39:45.625
Babe.

39:45.708 --> 39:46.916
The necklace?

39:47.000 --> 39:48.166
Is that real?

39:48.250 --> 39:50.875
No, baby, I got from China Town.

39:50.958 --> 39:52.541
It's so cheap.

39:52.625 --> 39:54.666
It cost about R20.

39:54.750 --> 39:56.916
Yoh, no. It looks like…

39:57.500 --> 39:58.583
Like the real thing.

39:58.666 --> 40:00.375
They really know how to
make these things these days.

40:00.458 --> 40:02.625
Ah, you know how the Chinese are.

40:02.708 --> 40:04.750
-I know them.

40:04.833 --> 40:06.583
Don't worry we'll be alright.

40:06.666 --> 40:08.583
Soon we'll be able to
afford to eat crayfish.

40:09.125 --> 40:10.708
Hey? As well as…

40:11.791 --> 40:13.041
Lobster, huh?

40:13.750 --> 40:15.625
The high life things.

40:43.166 --> 40:44.875
<i>Fuck it, you're beautiful!</i>

40:45.541 --> 40:47.083
<i>And can I tell you something,</i>

40:47.166 --> 40:49.375
<i>rich people love beautiful shit!</i>

40:51.333 --> 40:53.916
<i>After all, I want to get you a rich man.</i>

40:54.666 --> 40:56.208
<i>Take you out of poverty, you know.</i>

41:09.541 --> 41:10.916
-Good day.
-Hi.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.375
Take a seat.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.083
How can I help you?

41:19.166 --> 41:21.500
Ma, I actually came to…

41:23.416 --> 41:25.750
I want Kedibone's hand in marriage.

41:25.833 --> 41:27.833
I… I want to make her my wife.

41:28.791 --> 41:31.625
Hah! That will never happen.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.583
This child!

41:35.666 --> 41:37.250
No, that can't happen.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.208
-Why not?
-No ways.

41:39.291 --> 41:41.000
Please hear me out.

41:41.083 --> 41:42.666
Kedibone…

41:42.750 --> 41:44.041
I love Kedibone.

41:44.125 --> 41:45.833
Are you ready for marriage?

41:45.916 --> 41:49.083
Or you think marriage is a joke.

41:49.166 --> 41:51.541
-I am ready.
-Okay, forget that.

41:51.625 --> 41:53.250
I'll pretend that I'm Kedibone.

41:53.333 --> 41:56.666
Propose to me so I can see if
you're as ready as you claim to be.

41:57.458 --> 41:58.458
Mmm!

41:59.125 --> 42:01.250
Okay… um…

42:02.208 --> 42:03.625
Uh…

42:03.708 --> 42:05.416
Put the ring on my finger!

42:07.166 --> 42:08.958
Kedi…Kedibone.

42:09.916 --> 42:12.375
K… K… Kedibone Ma… Manamela.

42:17.791 --> 42:21.833
Are you just going to
keep calling her name?

42:21.916 --> 42:24.458
And not state your intention?

42:24.541 --> 42:26.208
If you're going to propose to Kedibone,

42:26.291 --> 42:28.291
you need to be confident.

42:28.958 --> 42:30.708
And not stutter, Kedibone, Kedibone!

42:31.291 --> 42:33.541
I will allow you to marry Kedibone

42:33.625 --> 42:37.875
but don't do what you just did ever again.

42:38.458 --> 42:40.708
This won't work. Go and practise!

42:40.791 --> 42:45.625
Use a mirror and make sure you know
what to say when you talk to Kedibone.

42:45.708 --> 42:46.916
Go, go, go!.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.416
It's a surprise.

42:48.500 --> 42:49.958
Wait a minute, wait a bit.

42:50.041 --> 42:52.583
Stand right here.

42:52.666 --> 42:55.375
-Okay, now I'm nervous.
-Okay. Ready?

42:55.458 --> 42:57.583
-Ah!

42:58.375 --> 43:00.291
This is yours.

43:00.375 --> 43:02.416
Fully paid and all.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.541
Welcome home, Crayfish.

43:08.666 --> 43:09.750
What!

43:18.708 --> 43:20.833
This is so…

43:28.250 --> 43:29.750
Look at my view!

43:29.833 --> 43:31.583
No frickin ways!

43:33.166 --> 43:34.250
Phew!

43:56.083 --> 43:57.375
Hmm.

44:03.583 --> 44:06.416
Do you want
a taste of this crayfish?

44:08.083 --> 44:09.541
Yes, Crayfish.

44:10.208 --> 44:11.458
Yes.

44:32.416 --> 44:35.041
-Ah! -

44:37.833 --> 44:41.416
-Isn't there a lift?
-We're already here my guy.

44:42.875 --> 44:44.583
We're going to get fit here.

44:44.666 --> 44:46.458
I am already fit.

44:46.541 --> 44:47.916
I was born fit.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.958
So, baby, what do you think?

44:50.041 --> 44:52.458
-Ah!

44:52.541 --> 44:54.666
-Yeah! You did well.

44:54.750 --> 44:57.875
-Ah! The view!

44:57.958 --> 44:59.458
Look at the Jozi skyline.

44:59.541 --> 45:01.250
-Ah, wow!

45:01.333 --> 45:02.541
So, tell me…

45:02.625 --> 45:04.541
the agent put all of this together?

45:04.625 --> 45:06.583
Yes, baby. All of it.

45:07.250 --> 45:11.666
Marble floors, marble kitchen, everything.

45:12.250 --> 45:14.500
-Just for you?
-No, baby, with Tanya.

45:14.583 --> 45:16.666
This other girl from
school. She is so cool.

45:19.375 --> 45:22.833
I also want this for myself one day.

45:22.916 --> 45:24.583
Wow! Yeah!

45:25.333 --> 45:26.875
Tony Montana views.

45:26.958 --> 45:28.333
The world is mine!

45:37.375 --> 45:39.291
I'm telling you.

45:39.375 --> 45:41.500
I'm telling you. Hey, hey!

45:41.583 --> 45:42.958
Are you jealous now, Msithi.

45:43.041 --> 45:45.625
We're here on the December 16 holiday.

45:45.708 --> 45:49.166
And I can't wait for us to make
great memories, right here.

45:49.250 --> 45:50.291
-Right here?
-Mmm…

45:50.375 --> 45:53.375
-Like… now?
-Mmm-hm.

45:54.208 --> 45:55.541
Msithi…

45:55.625 --> 45:57.958
Go kick start the car, we're leaving soon.

46:05.125 --> 46:06.916
-I have to go.
-Okay.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.708
Bye, baby.

46:13.333 --> 46:15.583
I'm telling you Msithi
the first three weeks…

46:16.375 --> 46:17.916
I couldn't sleep…

46:18.000 --> 46:24.750
Thinking about how these rich boys
might try and get with Kedi.

46:24.833 --> 46:26.625
Yoh!

46:26.708 --> 46:29.416
At least she got a decent place now.

46:29.500 --> 46:32.500
The one she used to live in was trash.

46:32.583 --> 46:34.791
Yeah, yeah. I agree.

46:34.875 --> 46:38.250
She's in heaven now
compared to where she was.

46:38.333 --> 46:41.541
Tell me something.
Is she only staying with her friend?

46:42.916 --> 46:44.125
Of course.

46:44.208 --> 46:46.666
And the agent is paying rent?

46:46.750 --> 46:49.333
Yeah, that sounds just about right.

46:49.416 --> 46:51.458
Have you met this agent?

46:51.541 --> 46:54.041
What business do I have with the agent?

46:54.125 --> 46:57.541
Have you met him?
Do you even know his name?

46:57.625 --> 46:59.708
-Who are you talking about?
-The agent.

46:59.791 --> 47:01.375
Msithi, how am I supposed to know?

47:01.458 --> 47:05.250
What's with all these questions?
You should've asked Kedibone!

47:05.333 --> 47:07.750
I don't know anything about agents
and how these things work.

47:07.833 --> 47:09.708
Okay, then. Don't get so emotional.

47:09.791 --> 47:11.625
Delivery for Kedibone.

47:14.291 --> 47:15.541
Kedibone?

47:16.333 --> 47:17.583
That's me.

47:20.416 --> 47:23.125
Rise of the African Child.

47:24.333 --> 47:27.208
You know, Dineo… This is a big play.

47:27.291 --> 47:29.458
And you are just the
right person for this role.

47:32.083 --> 47:36.833
You and only you
are perfect for this role.

47:36.916 --> 47:39.000
It's as if they wrote this play for you.

47:58.708 --> 47:59.791
Yes?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.875
I thought you said you'd call me.

48:04.125 --> 48:06.166
Look, my plate is kinda
full right now, so… yeah.

48:06.250 --> 48:08.875
But do you know what,
I really need this class in order to pass.

48:10.166 --> 48:12.041
I don't know, Kedibone.

48:19.333 --> 48:22.041
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

48:40.875 --> 48:43.625
I saw on Instagram you are
looking for actors and models.

48:43.708 --> 48:45.291
Well, I'm studying to be an actress.

48:45.375 --> 48:46.500
Oh, okay.

48:46.583 --> 48:48.083
Uh… tell me…

48:48.166 --> 48:49.958
What kind of acting do you do.

48:50.041 --> 48:53.083
Well, I am acting on
a stage play at school.

48:53.166 --> 48:54.291
And they gave me a lead role…

48:54.375 --> 48:56.625
w… which I lost but I'm gonna
get it back soon.

48:56.708 --> 48:59.375
Tell me, what are you busy with
next weekend. Are you are available?

48:59.458 --> 49:01.041
I'm definitely free!

49:01.125 --> 49:02.625
-Hello.
-Hello, Sir.

49:02.708 --> 49:05.083
Uh… I would like to make
a withdrawal, please.

49:05.166 --> 49:06.708
Okay please insert your card there.

49:09.958 --> 49:11.583
Please enter your pin.

49:13.708 --> 49:16.125
Okay, so… how much do you want to draw?

49:18.541 --> 49:19.708
All of it.

49:19.791 --> 49:21.041
Are you sure?

49:21.666 --> 49:22.750
Yes.

49:22.833 --> 49:24.500
Please hurry up, my sister.

49:24.583 --> 49:27.000
So, where do I get the script?

49:27.083 --> 49:28.458
Don't worry where you are going.

49:28.541 --> 49:30.166
They will have a script for you my angel.

49:30.250 --> 49:32.041
And how much do you pay?

49:32.125 --> 49:33.541
Let me tell you.

49:33.625 --> 49:34.625
Eighty thousand rand.

49:34.708 --> 49:35.833
For starters!

49:35.916 --> 49:37.250
Eight… Eighty thousand…

49:37.333 --> 49:38.916
My girl, I'm telling you.

49:39.458 --> 49:41.791
Plenty more where that came from.

49:41.875 --> 49:43.541
Okay, this is all of it.

49:43.625 --> 49:46.416
Twenty thousand… as you requested.

49:58.791 --> 50:00.541
Am I gonna get my lead role back?

50:01.500 --> 50:02.500
Yes.

50:48.958 --> 50:50.541
-Ah! -How are you?

50:50.625 --> 50:55.125
I called you here because I want to
know who you've invited for the ceremony.

50:55.208 --> 50:57.250
I've already spoken to Gheminah about it.

50:57.333 --> 51:00.500
She said she'll invite
the friends from varsity.

51:00.583 --> 51:02.416
Okay, but don't forget about the cousins.

51:02.500 --> 51:03.916
And the rest of the family.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.541
This is a big deal.

51:05.625 --> 51:07.000
I won't forget about them.

51:07.083 --> 51:09.166
It's just that I wanted to lay low because

51:09.250 --> 51:11.041
you know, it's a surprise.

51:11.125 --> 51:13.166
I'm aware that it's a surprise.

51:13.250 --> 51:16.000
I know how to keep a secret.

51:16.083 --> 51:18.875
What I want to know is do you
have the funds to make this possible?

51:18.958 --> 51:21.125
Financially I'm sorted.

51:21.208 --> 51:25.000
I even got overtime pay from work.

51:25.083 --> 51:28.500
She's also found an agent.
Everything is going according to plan.

51:28.583 --> 51:30.375
Hey! Wow!

51:30.458 --> 51:32.541
Thank God for that agent.

51:32.625 --> 51:34.583
He's a gift from above.

51:38.708 --> 51:41.208
Oh, now I'm convinced
that this acting thing…

51:42.541 --> 51:44.083
You know… it's working for her.

51:44.166 --> 51:48.291
I'm also going to see if we can
extend an invitation to the agent.

51:48.375 --> 51:50.666
You see, now you're talking.

51:50.750 --> 51:55.458
The agent needs to
bear witness to everything.

51:55.541 --> 51:57.791
-You know what I'm saying.
-I hear you loud and clear.

51:57.875 --> 51:59.125
Okay then…

51:59.208 --> 52:02.375
I'm preparing dinner
now and you're not invited.

52:02.458 --> 52:03.833
Please…

52:04.666 --> 52:07.208
Okay Ma'am, on another note…

52:07.750 --> 52:11.416
I think you have a hidden talent.

52:11.500 --> 52:13.333
Could you hit me with one more note…

52:13.416 --> 52:15.250
-before I leave.
-Hey!

52:20.666 --> 52:21.708
Okay girl, outside.

52:21.791 --> 52:23.375
Make sure you get the job done.

52:23.458 --> 52:25.541
He can have you, okay?

52:26.791 --> 52:28.541
Uh, uh, uh!

52:29.458 --> 52:30.500
What's this?

52:32.333 --> 52:33.458
How are you going to work like this?

52:33.541 --> 52:34.666
Go get changed.

52:35.791 --> 52:37.708
Hurry up and start drinking.

52:40.166 --> 52:42.708
Ooh, I can't deal with ghetto girls.

52:55.166 --> 52:56.541
You okay?

53:01.625 --> 53:04.458
-I think she wants some.
-She should. Definitely.

53:08.750 --> 53:11.333
It'll make you feel so good. Trust me.

53:11.416 --> 53:13.666
Have just a little. I cut
a little line just for you.

53:16.291 --> 53:17.708
It's a nice small one…

53:22.708 --> 53:24.333
It's good, hey?

53:24.416 --> 53:26.333
-Did you inhale?

53:29.416 --> 53:30.583
It's good, hey?

53:30.666 --> 53:32.208
I feel like I'm getting a nose bleed

53:35.083 --> 53:36.125
Fuck!

53:52.666 --> 53:56.250
Don't forget that you're paying.

53:56.333 --> 53:57.833
Yes. Yes.

53:58.416 --> 53:59.500
You see…

54:53.500 --> 54:54.791
-Hi… -Who's this?

54:54.875 --> 54:56.541
-Karabo.
-Oh, Kedibone.

54:56.625 --> 54:58.625
Yeah, where are you?
I'm still at your house and…

54:59.166 --> 55:00.125
I need my money.

55:00.208 --> 55:02.416
Listen, I'm at the airport now
getting ready to go to Cape Town so…

55:02.500 --> 55:04.583
You said you'd give me R 80,000.
When are you going to give it to me?

55:04.666 --> 55:06.416
Let me send you…

55:06.500 --> 55:09.250
-You wanted your R500.
-Five hundred ra…

55:10.875 --> 55:12.833
-What!
-Please don't stress me.

55:12.916 --> 55:14.875
I'm tired and I'm late for my flight, bye.

55:14.958 --> 55:16.208
No, but you…

55:35.708 --> 55:37.333
More lemon, please.

55:45.500 --> 55:46.625
Thank you.

55:50.458 --> 55:51.500
Kedibone.

55:52.750 --> 55:54.500
-How are you?
-Hi, Sir.

55:54.583 --> 55:56.708
Don't call me sir. We're not at school.

55:57.458 --> 55:59.291
Let's dance.

55:59.375 --> 56:03.208
No, I can't dance because
these heels are killing me.

56:03.291 --> 56:04.750
I'm not used to them.

56:04.833 --> 56:05.833
Oh!

56:09.583 --> 56:10.708
Can I join you?

56:10.791 --> 56:13.541
Do you need some company?

56:14.125 --> 56:17.875
I'm actually waiting for my friends
they just went to the bathroom.

56:17.958 --> 56:19.583
They'll be back for their seats.

56:19.666 --> 56:22.166
I'll see you around then.

56:35.125 --> 56:36.125
Shots?

56:38.125 --> 56:39.583
I don't do tequila shots.

56:40.750 --> 56:43.666
Look around, it's a
nominations after-party.

56:44.291 --> 56:45.333
Loosen up a bit.

56:45.958 --> 56:48.166
Yes, but do you see
that old man over there?

56:49.375 --> 56:51.541
-That old man?
-Yes.

56:51.625 --> 56:52.916
Tequila did that to him.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.333
He's an old man.

56:54.416 --> 56:56.000
You can't compare the two.

56:56.083 --> 56:57.166
Come on.

57:01.250 --> 57:02.500
Okay fine.

57:03.416 --> 57:04.625
Yeah!

57:09.708 --> 57:10.708
Ah ha…

57:10.791 --> 57:13.208
You know what, actual… here's another one.

57:13.291 --> 57:14.375
To your nomination.

57:15.250 --> 57:16.541
So, you do know who I am?

57:19.583 --> 57:22.916
Smash, the whole
country knows who you are.

57:24.916 --> 57:26.166
-Smash laughing]

57:26.250 --> 57:28.333
You know how to do your thing. Yoh!

57:28.416 --> 57:29.708
What is your name, buy the way?

57:30.875 --> 57:32.250
I'm Kedibone.

57:32.333 --> 57:33.625
Kedibone?

57:33.708 --> 57:35.666
-Yeah.
-Oh.

57:35.750 --> 57:36.833
I haven't seen you around, um…

57:36.916 --> 57:38.500
are you… new to the acting industry?

57:39.875 --> 57:42.166
Yeah, I'm studying acting actually.

57:42.708 --> 57:44.166
-Really?
-Yeah.

57:44.833 --> 57:48.250
I mean I am chilling with
actors, colleagues, producers.

57:48.916 --> 57:52.958
How are you gonna get to know anyone
in the industry if you're chilling here?

57:53.041 --> 57:54.083
Okay…

57:54.958 --> 57:56.041
Give me your things.

58:05.791 --> 58:07.833
Friend, call me back.

58:07.916 --> 58:09.166
I think…

58:09.250 --> 58:10.500
I think something is wrong.

58:11.708 --> 58:14.000
I think I am having contractions.

58:14.083 --> 58:15.666
Okay…

58:21.541 --> 58:22.541
Yoh!

58:23.541 --> 58:24.958
Should we leave this joint?

58:25.666 --> 58:27.916
Yeah, but he's my ride.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.083
Who?

58:30.041 --> 58:31.000
Him.

58:31.083 --> 58:32.583
Him?

58:32.666 --> 58:33.833
You're gonna leave your life in his hands?

58:33.916 --> 58:35.291
Seriously?

58:35.375 --> 58:36.583
Seriously?

58:36.666 --> 58:38.416
Can I Uber you home, wherever it is?

58:38.500 --> 58:39.708
Let's just go.

58:40.666 --> 58:42.875
-Okay.
-Okay.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.750
-Msithi.

58:47.833 --> 58:49.333
How…

58:49.416 --> 58:53.333
how do you get back in the game?

58:53.416 --> 58:54.541
Let me school you.

58:54.625 --> 58:56.000
When you're making love to a woman…

58:56.083 --> 58:57.125
Step one.

58:57.833 --> 58:58.916
Step two.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.875
Aye! Nicki Minaj.

59:00.958 --> 59:02.750
Ah! Face forward, back is mine!

59:02.833 --> 59:04.000
-Slow.
-Hey, man!

59:04.083 --> 59:04.958
The aim is not to rush…

59:05.041 --> 59:06.250
-No, man!
-…remember you're in charge.

59:07.291 --> 59:08.708
-Hey, man!
-When you get to the 4th round.

59:08.791 --> 59:10.250
You do the Thuso Phala shake.

59:11.875 --> 59:13.583
Then you release.

59:14.583 --> 59:15.583
I got this!

59:17.541 --> 59:18.791
Aye!

59:18.875 --> 59:19.875
Ah!

59:22.458 --> 59:23.458
Ah!

59:29.541 --> 59:31.708
Where did you get this?

59:31.791 --> 59:33.458
It's on a wall in my house.

59:34.625 --> 59:36.291
I know it's in your house… I mean like…

59:36.375 --> 59:37.375

59:41.291 --> 59:43.250
Online photo of the day…

59:43.333 --> 59:45.583

59:46.416 --> 59:48.458
-I'm sorry it's
not my-- -Relax.

59:49.125 --> 59:50.541
Oh, that's why.

59:57.833 --> 1:00:00.208
Ah!

1:00:00.291 --> 1:00:04.416
Yoh, it's the Gqom
party vibe. Take me to Soweto!

1:00:04.500 --> 1:00:07.125
Yes, yes! Oh yeah!

1:00:24.666 --> 1:00:25.958
Ah…

1:00:26.041 --> 1:00:28.458
You know what, dancing is not…

1:00:28.541 --> 1:00:30.791
-You're going to hurt yourself.
-for everyone.

1:00:30.875 --> 1:00:32.458
You need a degree for this shit.

1:00:32.541 --> 1:00:33.708
-Yoh!
-Come here.

1:00:34.708 --> 1:00:36.375
Huh-uh, huh-uh, Smash.

1:00:37.916 --> 1:00:38.958
What?

1:00:39.625 --> 1:00:40.833
What, what, what, like…

1:00:41.375 --> 1:00:42.375
I have protection.

1:00:42.458 --> 1:00:44.166
It… it's not that.

1:00:45.750 --> 1:00:47.208
Wait! Don't, don't…

1:00:48.916 --> 1:00:49.916
It's…

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.541
It's not like you are
virgin or something right…

1:00:51.625 --> 1:00:54.208
coz that would be some
really fucked up shit.

1:00:56.916 --> 1:00:58.833
-You are?

1:00:59.708 --> 1:01:01.416
No! Shit! Really?

1:01:02.750 --> 1:01:05.375
I'm just waiting for
somebody who really loves me.

1:01:06.041 --> 1:01:07.458
You know and…

1:01:07.541 --> 1:01:08.833
Someone special.

1:01:09.583 --> 1:01:10.625
Well, you're…

1:01:10.708 --> 1:01:11.833
special…

1:01:11.916 --> 1:01:12.916

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.666
--Trust
me, trust me. Listen.

1:01:15.458 --> 1:01:16.541
We're here…

1:01:16.625 --> 1:01:19.083
in this moment right now for a reason.

1:01:30.625 --> 1:01:32.166
Huh… Uh-uh.

1:01:32.250 --> 1:01:33.250
Stop.

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:36.125
Please.

1:01:36.208 --> 1:01:37.208
I so… I…

1:01:37.291 --> 1:01:38.791
I just don't wanna do this.

1:01:40.875 --> 1:01:42.416
-I'm not ready.

1:01:44.833 --> 1:01:46.166
I love you.

1:01:46.250 --> 1:01:48.500
I mean I… I could love you.

1:01:48.583 --> 1:01:50.250
-I love you.
-I will love you.

1:01:50.333 --> 1:01:52.541
-I will…

1:01:52.625 --> 1:01:54.083
What are you saying?

1:01:54.791 --> 1:01:56.083
Kedi…

1:01:56.166 --> 1:01:57.333
I love you.

1:01:57.416 --> 1:01:59.500
-And I… will always love you.

1:02:00.750 --> 1:02:02.166
What… What are you saying?

1:02:02.250 --> 1:02:03.916
-Come on.
-Huh-uh. Huh-uh.

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:05.541
Hmm-mm!

1:02:06.541 --> 1:02:07.541
If you…

1:02:07.625 --> 1:02:10.750
If you really, really,
really love me then…

1:02:10.833 --> 1:02:12.041
you'll wait.

1:02:13.750 --> 1:02:14.791
Alright.

1:02:18.708 --> 1:02:20.250
In the family…

1:02:49.500 --> 1:02:50.750
Are you sleeping for real?

1:03:21.541 --> 1:03:22.833
Hey, Babe…

1:03:37.166 --> 1:03:38.208
Smiso.

1:03:38.291 --> 1:03:39.291
Smiso!

1:03:39.375 --> 1:03:40.791
You, get up!

1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:43.458
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh shit!

1:03:44.166 --> 1:03:45.208
Are you serious?

1:03:45.291 --> 1:03:47.583
Babe listen, when did you land?

1:03:47.666 --> 1:03:48.875
Fuck you!

1:03:48.958 --> 1:03:50.291
Now I know why your phone is off!

1:03:50.375 --> 1:03:51.375
You were busy with this whore!

1:03:51.458 --> 1:03:52.500
In my house! Babe, I had…

1:03:52.583 --> 1:03:53.875
-I had an awards ceremony.
-Get your hands off me!

1:03:53.958 --> 1:03:54.958
You!

1:03:55.041 --> 1:03:56.583
Get your things and get
the fuck out of my house.

1:03:56.666 --> 1:03:57.666
Now!

1:03:57.750 --> 1:03:58.958
Pamela, leave her.

1:03:59.041 --> 1:04:01.333
Don't… You're don't have
to talk to her like that.

1:04:01.416 --> 1:04:02.458
We are supposed to be getting married.

1:04:02.541 --> 1:04:03.875
I am pregnant with your child

1:04:03.958 --> 1:04:06.708
but as soon as I turn my
back you fuck around like this!

1:04:06.791 --> 1:04:08.583
What is wrong with you, Smiso!

1:04:08.666 --> 1:04:09.666
I can explain.

1:04:09.750 --> 1:04:11.041
Are you still here!

1:04:11.125 --> 1:04:12.708
Get up and get out!

1:04:13.416 --> 1:04:16.625
Get the fuck out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house!

1:04:16.708 --> 1:04:18.041
Don't talk to her like that.

1:04:18.125 --> 1:04:19.333
Leave me alone!

1:04:19.416 --> 1:04:20.833
Get the fuck out of my house!

1:04:20.916 --> 1:04:22.166
Baby…

1:04:22.250 --> 1:04:24.125
Eish! Shit!

1:04:56.875 --> 1:04:58.250
Kedibone…

1:04:59.250 --> 1:05:00.750
It's going to be alright.

1:05:02.500 --> 1:05:03.875
Don't be scared.

1:05:07.250 --> 1:05:08.333
Are you okay?

1:05:08.916 --> 1:05:09.958
Yeah.

1:05:12.291 --> 1:05:13.291
Okay.

1:05:13.375 --> 1:05:14.833
We should go to bed.

1:06:20.041 --> 1:06:21.666
S… Step…

1:06:34.333 --> 1:06:35.375
on…

1:06:55.708 --> 1:06:57.541
Please! One line, one line.

1:06:58.208 --> 1:06:59.208
Please!

1:07:06.583 --> 1:07:08.750
Okay. It's time.

1:07:11.791 --> 1:07:13.333
No wait, wait. Please!

1:07:19.333 --> 1:07:21.208
Well, you're pregnant.

1:07:23.708 --> 1:07:25.083
Fuck!

1:07:25.166 --> 1:07:26.541
Fuck!

1:07:26.625 --> 1:07:28.125
Eww Kedi!

1:07:28.208 --> 1:07:30.000
Eww!

1:07:30.083 --> 1:07:32.083
--Fuck!

1:07:34.583 --> 1:07:36.208
Are you gonna tell your boyfriend?

1:07:41.208 --> 1:07:42.333
It's not his?

1:07:44.833 --> 1:07:46.250
So… what's the plan?

1:07:51.791 --> 1:07:52.791
Kedibone…

1:07:52.875 --> 1:07:54.458
What's going on?
I'm in the middle of my lecture.

1:07:57.041 --> 1:07:58.166
I'm pregnant.

1:07:59.916 --> 1:08:00.916
It's not mine.

1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.208
Dexter, a girl always knows, okay.

1:08:03.291 --> 1:08:04.958
No… No, she doesn't.

1:08:06.750 --> 1:08:07.791
I want an abortion.

1:08:21.541 --> 1:08:22.958
Um… okay.

1:08:24.083 --> 1:08:28.416
-Let's do it.
-I'm broke. I only have like… 2000.

1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:32.541
-And I need 7000.
-Yoh! I don't have that kind of money.

1:09:16.166 --> 1:09:17.500
So, this is your cousin?

1:09:18.916 --> 1:09:20.458
-Yes, I am the cousin.
-Yeah.

1:09:32.708 --> 1:09:34.500
So you're claiming that's my child?

1:09:52.666 --> 1:09:53.875
Franco…

1:09:56.250 --> 1:09:59.416
I did everything you asked me to do.

1:10:01.541 --> 1:10:06.125
We'd go to fancy parties.
Do my make-up, dress up and then show up.

1:10:08.541 --> 1:10:10.083
This how you treat me?

1:10:11.625 --> 1:10:14.958
From being a crayfish
to just being pollution in the ocean?

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.625
Is this how you see me now?

1:10:22.583 --> 1:10:24.041
You know what?

1:10:24.750 --> 1:10:27.166
I didn't send you…

1:10:27.250 --> 1:10:29.875
to be a porn star. Do you hear me?

1:10:29.958 --> 1:10:32.833
Hmm?
Busy entertaining other men. Hmm!

1:10:32.916 --> 1:10:34.916
Like a whore. After everything!

1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.041
After everything I have done for you!

1:10:38.125 --> 1:10:39.583
From me.

1:10:39.666 --> 1:10:43.000
I sacrificed every single thing for you.

1:10:43.083 --> 1:10:46.208
I sacrificed my youth
and my beauty for you, Franco.

1:10:48.416 --> 1:10:50.375
You took my virginity.

1:10:53.625 --> 1:10:55.125
And you took my money.

1:10:55.916 --> 1:10:57.541
What did you do with all of it?

1:10:58.958 --> 1:11:00.625
I paid for tuition.

1:11:01.666 --> 1:11:02.791
And I have to eat.

1:11:10.833 --> 1:11:12.125
How much are we talking about exactly?

1:11:12.208 --> 1:11:13.250
Uh… Five thousand.

1:11:13.333 --> 1:11:14.541
Are you mad!

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:23.666
Then I'm keeping it.

1:11:24.958 --> 1:11:27.458
If the family finds out
about the pregnancy…

1:11:27.541 --> 1:11:28.708
they will come for you.

1:11:31.375 --> 1:11:32.458
I'm coming with.

1:11:34.208 --> 1:11:35.291
Let's go.

1:11:36.833 --> 1:11:38.166
Mavis, car keys!

1:12:15.375 --> 1:12:17.375
The biggest
whore in the fucking world!

1:12:17.458 --> 1:12:20.375
-What?
-We know you slept with her father.

1:12:21.625 --> 1:12:23.583
How could you do this to me?

1:12:26.333 --> 1:12:28.625
Don't you… Hey! Hey!

1:12:28.708 --> 1:12:30.750
Don't you dare touch her!

1:12:49.583 --> 1:12:51.375
-I need a drink.

1:12:52.208 --> 1:12:53.375
A drink like alcohol?

1:12:53.458 --> 1:12:54.791
-Yes.
-Now?

1:12:54.875 --> 1:12:56.083
Just drive.

1:12:59.750 --> 1:13:02.416
-How's things Msithi?
-Good thanks and yourself?

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:04.250
I'm good, can I have the usual.

1:13:04.333 --> 1:13:05.541
Alright, sharp!

1:13:06.375 --> 1:13:09.083
I got a nice surprise for you.

1:13:09.166 --> 1:13:10.291
Check this out.

1:13:12.583 --> 1:13:13.708
Who this is?

1:13:17.166 --> 1:13:19.250
<i>Don't forget that you're paying.</i>

1:13:19.333 --> 1:13:23.083
<i>Touch is a move and a move is a price.</i>

1:13:23.166 --> 1:13:25.583
No man, is this not Kedibone?

1:13:25.666 --> 1:13:27.333
-Yes, that's her.
-Mrembula's girl?

1:13:28.083 --> 1:13:29.625
-Yers.
-Where did you get it?

1:13:29.708 --> 1:13:31.166
-Instagram.
-Oh, I see…

1:13:31.250 --> 1:13:32.333
You've got data, hey.

1:13:32.416 --> 1:13:34.583
She's a slay queen now?

1:13:36.458 --> 1:13:38.041
-Thanks.
-Cheers!

1:13:51.666 --> 1:13:53.791
I'm going to the bathroom, okay

1:13:58.500 --> 1:14:01.416
-What's up man.
-I'm good, what's up?

1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:03.291
Why are you checking out my girl.

1:14:03.375 --> 1:14:04.416
-What's up with that?
-What?

1:14:04.500 --> 1:14:06.708
-What's up with that?
-Oh! Oh!

1:14:06.791 --> 1:14:08.791
Chill man, let me show you something.

1:14:10.541 --> 1:14:12.625
<i>Don't forget that you're paying.</i>

1:14:12.708 --> 1:14:15.125
<i>Touch is a move and a move is a price.</i>

1:14:15.208 --> 1:14:17.500
<i>Hey, he saw you!</i>

1:14:21.125 --> 1:14:22.416
Where did you get this?

1:14:23.083 --> 1:14:24.541
It's on the…

1:14:24.625 --> 1:14:26.375
You know what, forget it.

1:14:43.416 --> 1:14:44.458
We're leaving.

1:14:45.208 --> 1:14:46.583
Oh, baby.

1:14:48.291 --> 1:14:50.291
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

1:14:51.875 --> 1:14:53.541
Kedibone are you cheating on me?

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:56.875
-What?
-You heard me. Answer my question.

1:14:56.958 --> 1:14:58.458
Are you cheating?

1:14:58.541 --> 1:14:59.750
No, baby.

1:15:00.458 --> 1:15:01.500
What are you talking about?

1:15:01.583 --> 1:15:03.500
Explain to me why there's a video of you…

1:15:03.583 --> 1:15:05.458
twerking on some random guys…

1:15:06.166 --> 1:15:08.916
On that guy's phone
back at the restaurant.

1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:10.666
So you are accusing me of cheating?

1:15:11.541 --> 1:15:12.958
Seriously, Tebogo?

1:15:13.708 --> 1:15:16.500
I'm at school every day but
you're accusing me of cheating!

1:15:19.583 --> 1:15:21.541
You know what, it's fine.

1:15:21.625 --> 1:15:23.875
I can tell you've found someone else.

1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:25.708
What!

1:15:25.791 --> 1:15:27.375
-You've found someone else.
-Someone else?

1:15:27.458 --> 1:15:28.625
-You got a new girlfriend Tebogo.
-Someone else?

1:15:28.708 --> 1:15:30.541
If you want to break up do it like a man.

1:15:30.625 --> 1:15:32.125
What are you on about?

1:15:33.375 --> 1:15:35.000
I'm trying and…

1:15:35.083 --> 1:15:37.333
Here I am thinking I have your support.

1:15:40.083 --> 1:15:41.916
You're not being fair, baby.

1:15:47.500 --> 1:15:48.541
I'm sorry.

1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:50.541
Sorry. It's just…

1:15:51.875 --> 1:15:54.625
It's just that the way that
guy was looking at you…

1:15:55.333 --> 1:15:56.708
Next thing…

1:15:56.791 --> 1:15:58.375
I see someone who looks like you…

1:15:58.458 --> 1:15:59.541
Babe…

1:15:59.625 --> 1:16:02.291
Cheating on you is the
last thing on my mind.

1:16:07.666 --> 1:16:08.750
Tebogo.

1:16:10.458 --> 1:16:12.916
-Look at me.
-Please don't lie to me.

1:16:14.583 --> 1:16:15.958
Please don't lie to me.

1:16:16.041 --> 1:16:17.791
I would never lie to you, baby.

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.166
I would never lie to you.

1:16:31.875 --> 1:16:33.250
Oh, Msithi?

1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:41.625
We need to talk.

1:16:42.333 --> 1:16:43.666
And Tebogo?

1:16:44.416 --> 1:16:45.625
I need to talk to you alone.

1:16:46.375 --> 1:16:47.916
What is it? Is everything okay?

1:16:48.583 --> 1:16:49.750
Are you cheating?

1:16:51.458 --> 1:16:53.458
-What?
-Cut the crap!

1:16:54.250 --> 1:16:55.500
Don't act all innocent here.

1:16:55.583 --> 1:16:57.333
I see your promiscuous ways!

1:16:57.416 --> 1:16:58.541
Me, promiscious?

1:16:58.625 --> 1:17:00.208
I don't know what you're talking about.

1:17:00.958 --> 1:17:02.750
I have been seeing you
with these celebrity guys.

1:17:02.833 --> 1:17:05.750
Driving Lamborghini's with big
bellies and high blood pressure.

1:17:05.833 --> 1:17:08.625
I am the dealer that side. You
don't think they tell me these things.

1:17:13.916 --> 1:17:14.958
You know…

1:17:16.625 --> 1:17:18.708
All wanted to do in this industry was…

1:17:18.791 --> 1:17:20.333
just to make it.

1:17:25.666 --> 1:17:26.916
But then you meet…

1:17:27.833 --> 1:17:29.125
Can I call you crayfish?

1:17:29.708 --> 1:17:31.125
A young Thespian.

1:17:31.208 --> 1:17:34.041
I saw on Instagram that you
are looking for actors and models.

1:17:34.125 --> 1:17:35.416
So you do know who I am?

1:17:36.291 --> 1:17:38.375
To meet mercy people and then…

1:17:39.916 --> 1:17:41.583
They sell you the world…

1:17:41.666 --> 1:17:42.875
What's this?

1:17:43.916 --> 1:17:45.666
Possibilities!

1:17:45.750 --> 1:17:47.333
And you, Kedibone…

1:17:47.416 --> 1:17:49.083
You're perfect for this role.

1:17:49.791 --> 1:17:51.583
So, how much do you guys pay?

1:17:51.666 --> 1:17:52.708
Eighty thousand rand.

1:17:52.791 --> 1:17:54.000
Just for starters!

1:17:54.083 --> 1:17:57.250
I mean I am chilling with
actors, colleagues, producers.

1:17:58.083 --> 1:18:02.041
How are you gonna get to know anyone
in the industry if you're chilling here?

1:18:04.458 --> 1:18:06.333
And then they just wanna
use you for your looks.

1:18:07.291 --> 1:18:09.208
Great fit!

1:18:11.291 --> 1:18:12.791
Woah!

1:18:28.250 --> 1:18:30.250
I didn't know how I
was going to tell Tebogo.

1:18:33.833 --> 1:18:34.916
I mean…

1:18:35.541 --> 1:18:37.250
He paid for my tuition…

1:18:37.916 --> 1:18:40.291
by selling his inheritance!

1:18:40.375 --> 1:18:41.541
I know.

1:18:47.041 --> 1:18:48.416
I'm sorry.

1:18:52.041 --> 1:18:53.708
I'm not the one you're cheating on.

1:18:53.791 --> 1:18:56.958
You need to apologise to Mrembula not me!

1:18:57.791 --> 1:18:59.708
Yes, I know Msithi.

1:19:02.375 --> 1:19:03.416
Can I use your phone?

1:19:04.541 --> 1:19:07.458
I wanna call these other girls.
They wanted to come fetch me and…

1:19:07.541 --> 1:19:10.083
I just wanna cancel my plans, please.

1:19:10.166 --> 1:19:11.750
You're sleeping around…

1:19:12.541 --> 1:19:13.875
but you can't afford airtime?

1:19:22.833 --> 1:19:23.958
Thank you.

1:19:56.541 --> 1:19:57.625
Msithi?

1:19:59.333 --> 1:20:00.416
Thank you.

1:20:02.041 --> 1:20:03.125
Stop!

1:20:06.250 --> 1:20:07.541
Bloody cheater!

1:20:52.375 --> 1:20:55.083
<i>You have reached the voicemail box of…</i>

1:20:55.166 --> 1:20:56.458
<i>Yeah, Cray, Cray.</i>

1:20:57.458 --> 1:20:58.666
<i>You put me on voicemail.</i>

1:21:00.625 --> 1:21:02.000
<i>Hey!</i>

1:21:02.083 --> 1:21:03.875
<i>You took me for a ride.</i>

1:21:04.833 --> 1:21:06.708
<i>And played with my heart.</i>

1:21:08.833 --> 1:21:10.291
<i>You know, Crayfish…</i>

1:21:10.375 --> 1:21:13.458
<i>I gave you everything I have.</i>

1:21:13.541 --> 1:21:15.625
<i>I was there for you emotionally.</i>

1:21:15.708 --> 1:21:17.500
<i>Financially.</i>

1:21:17.583 --> 1:21:19.083
<i>Physically.</i>

1:21:19.166 --> 1:21:22.458
<i>And you just drop me automatically.</i>

1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:25.833
<i>Hey Crayfish… Crayfish!</i>

1:21:30.833 --> 1:21:32.958
<i>You hurt me Crayfish.</i>

1:21:39.958 --> 1:21:41.333
Cray…

1:21:42.541 --> 1:21:43.666
Eish!

1:21:47.916 --> 1:21:49.166
Woah!

1:21:50.291 --> 1:21:51.916
Life is tough!

1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.083
Hey!

1:22:06.541 --> 1:22:07.916
Thank you. Thank you.

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:09.250
Thank you very much.

1:22:09.333 --> 1:22:11.875
-You know this one's for you, right?

1:22:15.666 --> 1:22:19.166
Smash, Smash, Smash, Smash!

1:22:31.125 --> 1:22:32.500
Can I have a word?

1:22:33.708 --> 1:22:34.625
What!

1:22:34.708 --> 1:22:36.541
I've meant to give you a call.

1:22:36.625 --> 1:22:39.000
It's just I realised I don't
even have your number.

1:22:39.625 --> 1:22:41.458
You already got what you wanted.

1:22:41.541 --> 1:22:42.708
Listen…

1:22:44.541 --> 1:22:45.875
I came to apologise.

1:22:45.958 --> 1:22:47.333
I should have said that I'm…

1:22:48.291 --> 1:22:49.333
engaged.

1:22:55.541 --> 1:22:56.666
You must think I'm a dog.

1:22:57.333 --> 1:22:58.458
Dogs are cute!

1:22:59.541 --> 1:23:00.750
You are evil, Smash!

1:23:01.750 --> 1:23:03.333
Hey, come on, I…

1:23:03.416 --> 1:23:04.833
You raped me.

1:23:06.625 --> 1:23:07.625
Rape?

1:23:08.666 --> 1:23:09.666
Kedi, I didn't…

1:23:09.750 --> 1:23:10.750
I didn't rape you.

1:23:12.125 --> 1:23:13.875
We both got back…

1:23:13.958 --> 1:23:15.666
You raped me, Smash.

1:23:22.666 --> 1:23:24.041
Hear me out. Hear me out.

1:23:25.291 --> 1:23:26.500
I genuinely wanna help you.

1:23:27.208 --> 1:23:28.625
You said you wanna get into the industry.

1:23:28.708 --> 1:23:30.041
I wanna hook you up. I wanna…

1:23:30.125 --> 1:23:31.416
-I want you to meet my people.
-You know what.

1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:33.208
-Get into his book…
-You're wasting my time.

1:23:34.958 --> 1:23:36.375
Kedi…

1:23:36.458 --> 1:23:37.458
Kedi…

1:23:38.541 --> 1:23:41.375
Smash! Smash! Smash!

1:23:54.458 --> 1:23:55.500
Hello.

1:24:27.250 --> 1:24:28.666
I brought some baby clothes.

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:34.958
Thank you.

1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.250
Themba.

1:24:50.708 --> 1:24:52.291
Come get the baby.

1:25:11.166 --> 1:25:12.125
So…

1:25:14.833 --> 1:25:16.500
How's life been treating you?

1:25:25.458 --> 1:25:26.458
Fine.

1:25:53.250 --> 1:25:54.291
I'm sorry.

1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:32.083
Hi, baby.

1:26:34.083 --> 1:26:36.125
Okay where are you taking me?

1:26:38.958 --> 1:26:41.041
Yeah, but how must I know what to wear

1:26:41.125 --> 1:26:42.291
when I don't know where you're taking me.

1:26:43.833 --> 1:26:46.083
Baby, come on,
you know I hate surprises.

1:26:47.583 --> 1:26:50.583
Okay, okay fine.

1:26:50.666 --> 1:26:51.875
Cool.

1:26:57.375 --> 1:27:00.166
Ah! Crayfish!

1:27:00.791 --> 1:27:04.791
I don't like how things ended between us.

1:27:04.875 --> 1:27:07.083
-I know your birthday is coming up.
-Don't touch me!

1:27:07.833 --> 1:27:08.916
Yoh!

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:10.791
I bought you something, hey.

1:27:11.750 --> 1:27:12.875
Voila!

1:27:13.500 --> 1:27:14.750
You bought me a car?

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.458
This is not just any car.

1:27:19.125 --> 1:27:20.250
This is a machine.

1:27:21.875 --> 1:27:23.916
I'm fine. You can keep it.

1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:25.375
Ah!

1:27:25.458 --> 1:27:26.833
Since when?

1:27:29.166 --> 1:27:30.458
I'm moving out.

1:27:31.208 --> 1:27:33.166
-Where to?
-I'm going back home.

1:27:35.416 --> 1:27:36.625
Am I a joke to you?

1:27:38.083 --> 1:27:40.250
I will tell you when to leave.

1:27:41.083 --> 1:27:43.166
I'm the one paying for this apartment.

1:27:43.250 --> 1:27:44.666
Do you hear me!

1:27:44.750 --> 1:27:46.708
And you still owe me.

1:27:46.791 --> 1:27:49.916
One last round.

1:27:50.666 --> 1:27:53.333
-Where do you think you're going?
-Don't touch me!

1:27:53.416 --> 1:27:54.708
-Get off me!
-You're my whore, I own you.

1:27:54.791 --> 1:27:56.041
Now shut up!

1:28:01.958 --> 1:28:02.958
Kedibone!

1:28:04.583 --> 1:28:05.958
Baby…

1:28:06.666 --> 1:28:07.875
He's the agent I told you about.

1:28:07.958 --> 1:28:09.250
Agent?

1:28:11.125 --> 1:28:12.791
Kedibone what's going on here?

1:28:14.541 --> 1:28:15.791
-Huh?
-Guess who's in trouble now.

1:28:16.833 --> 1:28:17.916
I'm sorry, baby.

1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.750
Here's the story young
man, listen carefully.

1:28:21.583 --> 1:28:24.625
I know this looks bad.

1:28:24.708 --> 1:28:27.208
But I'll save you the heartache.

1:28:27.291 --> 1:28:28.250
Kedibone?

1:28:28.333 --> 1:28:31.041
There's a lot of women out there
and they're still gonna hurt you.

1:28:31.125 --> 1:28:33.833
I know because I was
once a young man like you.

1:28:33.916 --> 1:28:35.666
They'll hurt you real bad.

1:28:35.750 --> 1:28:38.000
You see how full of fish the ocean is?

1:28:38.083 --> 1:28:40.750
Crayfish there, crayfish all over.

1:28:40.833 --> 1:28:41.958
And you know what you did?

1:28:42.041 --> 1:28:43.833
You chose one crayfish and…

1:28:43.916 --> 1:28:45.041
And you put it in the fridge.

1:28:45.125 --> 1:28:47.208
And left the door unlocked.

1:28:47.791 --> 1:28:49.791
What did you think was going to happen?

1:28:49.875 --> 1:28:52.875
I opened the door and
helped myself to some crayfish.

1:28:52.958 --> 1:28:54.541
And it was appetising.

1:28:54.625 --> 1:28:56.375
I must say, your crayfish is delicious.

1:28:56.458 --> 1:28:57.875
Never tasted anything better.--

1:28:57.958 --> 1:29:01.791
-Tebogo, please.

1:29:01.875 --> 1:29:04.250
Tebogo you're hurting him.

1:29:04.333 --> 1:29:05.333
Tebogo stop!

1:29:05.416 --> 1:29:06.416
Let him go.

1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:07.625
Let go of me!

1:29:08.458 --> 1:29:09.958
Tebogo no, no no…

1:29:10.916 --> 1:29:12.583
Please don't kill me, I'm sorry.

1:29:12.666 --> 1:29:14.875
Let's talk about this. C'mon man.

1:29:22.375 --> 1:29:23.458
Let's go.

1:29:23.541 --> 1:29:26.625
Tebogo you're hurting me, let me go!

1:29:32.083 --> 1:29:35.291
Tebogo you are hurting me.

1:29:35.375 --> 1:29:36.625
Let go of me.

1:29:36.708 --> 1:29:39.416
-Shut up!
-Baby, I'm sorry.

1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:41.666
Baby, I'm sorry.

1:29:42.583 --> 1:29:45.291
Baby, listen, I'm sorry.

1:29:45.375 --> 1:29:47.208
-Get inside.
-Please.

1:29:48.958 --> 1:29:50.708
-Kedibone Manamela.

1:29:51.333 --> 1:29:52.375
My pure innocent woman.

1:29:52.458 --> 1:29:53.458
Virgin!

1:29:54.958 --> 1:29:55.958
Virgin!

1:29:56.666 --> 1:29:57.708
You!

1:29:58.750 --> 1:29:59.708
Jesus!

1:30:00.916 --> 1:30:02.416
<i>Your dad left you a good</i>
<i>inheritance in this car.</i>

1:30:02.500 --> 1:30:04.166
<i>-He did!</i>

1:30:07.833 --> 1:30:10.166
<i>I just wanna study, baby.</i>

1:30:10.250 --> 1:30:11.541
-Baby, please.
-Don't touch me!

1:30:11.625 --> 1:30:13.291
Tell me about your agent.

1:30:13.375 --> 1:30:14.625
It's really not what you think.

1:30:14.708 --> 1:30:16.375
Kedibone Manamela!

1:30:16.458 --> 1:30:18.125
-Baby, I'm sorry.
-Jesus!

1:30:18.208 --> 1:30:19.833
I'm sorry, baby!

1:30:19.916 --> 1:30:22.750
You are sorry?
Are you sorry for my father's car.

1:30:23.791 --> 1:30:25.208
I love you, baby.

1:30:26.875 --> 1:30:28.541
Baby, no!
