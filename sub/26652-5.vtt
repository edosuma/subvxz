the police precinct.

the Bureau's backyard.

pried themselves

03:17.980 --> 03:20.243
away from

hobbies are very important.

03:23.768 --> 03:24.943
Right, Rory?

03:24.987 --> 03:28.120
- I take my porn

03:28.599 --> 03:30.384
- Okay, back to work.

03:30.906 --> 03:35.345
In the summer of 1951, a film
screw shot footage of a monster

03:35.389 --> 03:36.999
in Tokyo Bay.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.522
Two days later,
the city was destroyed.

03:38.566 --> 03:42.657
We need to get that footage
before any panic sets in

03:42.700 --> 03:44.180
and to capture that monster

03:44.224 --> 03:46.226
before it can do
any real damage.

03:47.966 --> 03:51.100
And because we're shorthanded,
you're up.

03:51.666 --> 03:52.884
Time to earn your keep.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.372
- Bloody humans.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.113
All right, fine.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.855
But it's only to stop you
blinkered lot from giving

04:06.898 --> 04:09.553
a harmless monster
a one-way ticket to hell.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.251
At least with me there,

04:11.294 --> 04:13.818
the poor chap gets
a fair shake.

04:16.168 --> 04:19.389
- I like her. Yes.
I like her.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.000
- As you can see,
Mr. Heywood,

04:22.044 --> 04:23.654
the Time Bureau is putting
your money to great use.

04:23.698 --> 04:26.048
We now have multiple teams
deployed throughout history

04:26.091 --> 04:27.789
tracking down
and securing Fugitives.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.443
All trained by your son.

qualified Time Bureau personnel

And

04:33.664 --> 04:35.362
Here's Gary with a live one.

- Ah, say hello
to Baba Yaga.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.149
We caught her trying to eat
Chinese gymnasts

04:40.192 --> 04:42.543
at the 2008 Olympics.

04:44.022 --> 04:46.373
- Sorry about that, sir.

04:46.416 --> 04:50.464
- Just a typical
Russian greeting.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.599
- Are you sure this room
is secure enough

04:55.643 --> 04:56.948
to hold these creatures?

04:56.992 --> 04:58.559
- It's a temporary arrangement

04:58.602 --> 05:00.212
until our containment facility
is up and running, sir.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.519
- And they're heavily sedated,
right, Gary?

05:02.563 --> 05:05.305
- Yup. Double doses of elephant
tranquilizer all around.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.437
- This way.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.270

05:14.314 --> 05:15.663

under control here.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.055

05:17.099 --> 05:19.362
- I'll be seeing you tomorrow
for Thanksgiving.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.017
Your mother's really looking
forward to it and so am I.

05:22.060 --> 05:25.020
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.065
- What are you doing for
the holiday, Director Sharpe?

05:27.109 --> 05:29.154
Oh, well I was planning
on spending it

05:29.198 --> 05:31.156

but she's working overtime.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.377
So I'll probably just be
sticking around here, I guess.

05:34.421 --> 05:37.946

It'll be fun, right, Nathaniel?

05:39.251 --> 05:42.690

- Okay, everyone,
the turkey is almost done--

12:36.843 --> 12:37.844
- Wait for it.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.280
- Brining.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.891
Yeah, it just has to sit
for another hour and a half

12:41.935 --> 12:43.763
and then I'm going to pop it
into the oven.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.723
- Give or take six hours.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.509
- Oh, my God.

12:51.553 --> 12:54.338
- Tyson!
- Buckle up, Ava Sharpe.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.471
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.828
- Happy Thanksgiving,
Mr. Green.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.569
- Hi, Mona.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.571
Thanks for bringing me food
on a holiday.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.355
- It's literally my job.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.531
Why are you working on
Thanksgiving?

13:14.315 --> 13:15.969
What's the Time Bureau
do anyway?

13:17.274 --> 13:20.712
- It's like Groundhog Day.
Uh, we regulate time zones.

13:20.756 --> 13:23.063
So you got any plans
for the big meal?

13:23.106 --> 13:24.499
- Heck yeah, I do.

13:24.542 --> 13:27.458
My family's in LA, so it's
just me, instant ramen,

13:27.502 --> 13:28.982
and Bestflix binging.

13:29.025 --> 13:33.247
- Oh, well, uh,
if you want you could,

13:33.290 --> 13:35.379
uh, have Thanksgiving with me.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.555
- That's really sweet,
Mr. Green.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.035
But I don't want to eat
all of your food.

13:39.079 --> 13:43.431
- Oh, I happened to have
ordered enough for two.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.130
You're vegetarian, right?

14:01.057 --> 14:04.539
- Nora Darhk, what the blooming
hell are you doing here, eh?

14:04.582 --> 14:06.671
- I owed this guy a favor.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.501
- She shouldn't be here, mate.
I thought I warned you.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.163
- Gideon is showing strange
marine activity in this area.

14:20.207 --> 14:23.384
Fish disappearing en masse,
seismic tremors--

14:23.427 --> 14:24.733
- Do you need all that
just to end up back

14:24.776 --> 14:25.821
where the film was shot?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.388
- Just being thorough.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.520
- Hmm, using fancy toys instead
of your noggins, more like.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.088
- You know, I think I liked you
better when you were in a cage.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.437
- All right. Enough.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.570
All we got to do is draw
this thing out,

14:35.613 --> 14:38.007
we shrink it down,
and we're good to go.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.835
- And how do you expect us
to do that?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.358
We'll just summon it with
a friendly call?

14:41.402 --> 14:45.232
"Oy, monster, come up here.
Promise it's not a trap."

14:45.275 --> 14:47.190
- Or feed it like that guy.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.241
- Isn't that our friend
the film director?

14:58.419 --> 15:00.073
Feeding the whales,
Mr. Honda?

15:01.683 --> 15:03.903
You.
What are you doing here?

15:03.946 --> 15:06.644
- You first.
Start talking.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.698
What the hell is that?

15:17.786 --> 15:19.483
- It's evil.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.485
Truly evil.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.226
- I think we found
our Fugitive,

15:23.270 --> 15:25.011
but it's not a monster.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.537
- No.

15:29.580 --> 15:33.584
This is something much,
much worse.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.641
- This, chaps,
is no ordinary diary.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.599
It's an agent of Brigid.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.775
Brigid.

15:50.819 --> 15:53.822
The Celtic goddess of art,
creation, and healing.

15:55.476 --> 15:59.610
This book has the power
to make the imagination...

15:59.654 --> 16:00.829
a reality.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.527
- You are not film producers,
are you?

16:03.571 --> 16:06.791
- No, we are not. But we saw
what was on that film, Ishiro,

16:06.835 --> 16:08.010
and we're here to stop it.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.969
Tell us how you found
the journal.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.841
- I was out scouting
for my film.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.582
And I found this book.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.932
- You didn't find the book;
it found you.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.716
It's drawn to creative types.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.240
- Once I opened it,

16:20.849 --> 16:23.373
I was flooded with inspiration.

16:23.417 --> 16:27.247
An image that has honed
in my nightmares.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.814
Suddenly came to life
on those pages.

16:30.641 --> 16:34.254
And then to my horror...

16:35.820 --> 16:37.039
in real life.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.564
I told you
this book is evil.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.088
- Whoa, hold on a tic.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.960
Brigid created this book
as a gift to you humans.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.746
To bring your dreams to life.
You turned it into a weapon.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.531
- She's right.

16:51.184 --> 16:53.360
I did create
something horrible.

16:53.403 --> 16:57.016
- I call it Tagumo.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.843
A giant land octopus.

16:58.887 --> 17:02.325
Capable of destroying
entire cities.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.762
When I realized Tagumo
had come to life,

17:04.806 --> 17:07.678
I tried to destroy the journal.

17:07.722 --> 17:11.291
But it always comes back.

17:11.334 --> 17:14.816
- Of course it does. The power
links you in this book.

17:14.859 --> 17:17.862
It won't be released until
the story of your creation

17:17.906 --> 17:19.429
is played out in full.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.737
You pushed the octopus
in a volcano?

17:22.780 --> 17:24.391
- Nope.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.871
Tagumo wins.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.439
Tokyo is destroyed.

17:34.444 --> 17:35.402
- Oh, brother.

17:35.445 --> 17:36.751
- Oh, Rich!

17:36.794 --> 17:39.058
- You break it,
you bought it, Rich,

17:39.710 --> 17:41.625
- Well, this is a disaster.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.888
- Hey, no one's
killed each other yet

17:43.932 --> 17:46.369
Tyson?

17:46.413 --> 17:48.023
Dad, have you seen the boys?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.981
- Oh, last I saw them,
they were down in the basement.

17:50.025 --> 17:52.071
Playing with Nate's
old air rifle.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.858
- Mom!

17:56.901 --> 17:58.512
- Guess they know
how to load it.

17:58.555 --> 17:59.991
- Wow.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.951
- Okay,
if we can't stop Tagumo,

18:02.994 --> 18:04.822
then draw a new ending.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.998
Preferably one
where no one dies.

18:10.437 --> 18:17.444
♪

18:21.839 --> 18:23.580
- It's not working.

18:23.624 --> 18:24.799
- Like I said,

18:24.842 --> 18:26.148
Brigid created that book

18:26.192 --> 18:28.324
to help artists
express themselves.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.196
You can't expect him to
write a happy ending

18:30.239 --> 18:32.111
if he ain't had a happy life.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.808
Ain't that right, Ishiro?

18:33.851 --> 18:35.679
- You're right.

18:36.158 --> 18:42.904
Every night,
before this journal came to me,

18:42.947 --> 18:45.385
I'd close my eyes

18:45.428 --> 18:49.476
and be back
in the ruins of Hiroshima.

18:50.216 --> 18:54.133
Choking on ash, wondering
where all the people went.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.746
Not realizing
they were all around me

18:58.789 --> 19:00.965
in my hair,

19:01.009 --> 19:04.317
on my clothes,

19:04.360 --> 19:05.666
in my lungs.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.537
They turned to dust.

19:09.017 --> 19:13.326
Drawing Tagumo helped me
turn the nightmares

19:13.369 --> 19:15.502
into something
I could understand.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.895
A monster.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.551
But now I am the monster.

19:21.595 --> 19:27.470
- Ishiro, you went through
something truly unimaginable.

19:27.514 --> 19:30.517
We all deal with our pain
in different ways,

19:30.560 --> 19:32.519
and you chose art.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.347
And that's beautiful.

19:37.567 --> 19:41.571
Don't blame yourself.
This is not your fault.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.715
- Life force is the most potent
form of energy in the universe,

19:54.758 --> 19:57.848
and you're like a battery
about to run out of charge.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.937
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

19:59.981 --> 20:01.330
- Aye.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.245
- Then why didn't you
say anything?

20:03.289 --> 20:06.553
And help push you
off the wagon?

20:06.944 --> 20:09.947
You're clean, Nora.
It's best we keep you that way.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.129
- You don't want me
to do that, Ray.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.958
- Yes, I do.
Otherwise he's going to die.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.525
- Ray.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.267
My power comes from
my father.

20:25.833 --> 20:28.401
It's in my blood. It's
always going to be calling me,

20:28.444 --> 20:30.098
wanting me to give in
and be consumed,

20:30.141 --> 20:32.274
but I can't give in.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.363
I won't.

20:35.843 --> 20:39.325
- Now this is where we monitor
time zone infractions.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.242
- No, here at the Time Bureau,

20:43.285 --> 20:47.594
there's no such thing
as over...kill.

20:50.336 --> 20:53.077
You need to come with me.
Come, come, come.

20:53.121 --> 20:56.516
There's something else amazing
to see right in here.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.605
- Um, why are you--

20:58.648 --> 21:00.128
Yup.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.350
Hello?

21:04.393 --> 21:06.961
I--I think you forgot to unlock
the door.

♪

21:09.746 --> 21:11.748

fired.

21:17.493 --> 21:18.668
- Sorry to bother you,

21:18.712 --> 21:19.626
but we have a bit
of a situation in here.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.758
The prisoners are loose.

21:21.802 --> 21:24.195
How the hell did that happen?

21:24.239 --> 21:25.719

- No, no, no.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.722
We leave, Hank will know
something's wrong.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.201

21:30.245 --> 21:32.508
- So you want our liaison
to the DoD

21:32.552 --> 21:33.814
knowing that we messed up?

21:33.857 --> 21:35.642

both: Shut up, Gary.

21:37.687 --> 21:38.993
- All right,
I got a plan.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.995
I'll be back.
- No, no, no.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.170
Your family's going
to notice that you're gone.

Thanksgiving ever.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.751
But, like I said,
I have a plan.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.014

some tranq guns.

is she doing here?

22:16.073 --> 22:17.205
- She was supposed to stay
locked in the closet.

22:17.248 --> 22:18.511
I was going to flash
her later.

22:18.554 --> 22:19.947
- That didn't sound right.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.252

22:25.605 --> 22:27.128
Excellent hiding spot.

I'm not hiding.

My father sacrificed himself

I don't want to ruin it by
backsliding into dark magic.

Normally, I'd have to drain
someone's life to save his.

22:49.629 --> 22:53.720

essentially energy.

Right?

Look at this.

outdone yourself.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.430

an appetite.

23:08.474 --> 23:12.565
Uh, care to do the honors
this year, Nathaniel?

23:12.608 --> 23:14.088
Um, Nathaniel?

23:14.131 --> 23:16.699

just in the restroom.

23:16.743 --> 23:20.399

- Mom, I'm hungry.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.010

Just a little bit longer, boys.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.141

uh, sorry, sir.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.581
Do you know what we would
do in my family?

23:28.624 --> 23:30.626
We'd actually go around
and list all the things

23:30.670 --> 23:31.801

for so many things.

23:40.854 --> 23:44.466
So many, many things.

23:46.033 --> 23:48.339

23:48.383 --> 23:50.254
This is, like,
the coolest place ever.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.309
- Wait.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.183
- I've seen this before,

24:06.227 --> 24:07.620
They're hangry.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.317
These poor creatures
are starving to death.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.015
What does a Kaupe, Chupacabra,
and a Baba Yaga eat?

24:12.059 --> 24:14.365
- That'd be Hawaiian BBQ,
Birria, and Veal.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.846
Babies, more precisely,
but veal will do in a pinch.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.021
- I read a lot.

24:18.065 --> 24:19.762
- Wow.

those things on Thanksgiving?

24:21.329 --> 24:22.852

the story.

you're a writer?
