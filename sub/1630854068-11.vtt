Without my yes vote,
this merger dies.

10:44.460 --> 10:47.036
and all the while she's
choreographing a cover-up

10:47.205 --> 10:48.980
like she's Alvin Ailey.

10:49.207 --> 10:51.149
And now she gets to ride off
into the sunset

10:51.376 --> 10:54.727
on her very own stadium tour.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.637
Now you tell me how that's fair.

10:56.731 --> 10:59.215
It's not, honey bear.

10:59.234 --> 11:01.234
But the merger is a done deal.

11:01.386 --> 11:03.662
Not even Dottie Roman herself
could change that.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.498
Then why change it,

11:06.725 --> 11:08.958
when I can burn it all
to the ground?

11:10.820 --> 11:12.061
Thanks, Earl.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.322
No. No, no, no, no. No.
That's not what I meant.

11:15.417 --> 11:19.302
Why is it everybody always takes
my advice the wrong way?

11:22.665 --> 11:24.432
(knocking on door)

11:25.927 --> 11:28.061
-Hello.
-SKYLER: Hello.

11:30.765 --> 11:32.598
Usually, when a Roman
walks through my door,

11:32.751 --> 11:35.652
they're here to make
big, dramatic demands.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.698
Actually, I'm here for you.

11:39.925 --> 11:41.533
To keep you from making
a huge mistake.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.536
I know you're investing millions
of dollars into Monarch.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.204
Oh, hundreds of millions.

11:46.355 --> 11:48.189
Well, I think you should know
exactly what you're getting.

11:48.283 --> 11:51.209
-And what is that?
-A world of hurt.

11:51.436 --> 11:54.295
The Romans seem to destroy
everything they touch.

11:55.531 --> 11:58.124
-Go on.
-Well, Nicky, for instance,

11:58.293 --> 12:01.127
daughter of legendary
Dottie Roman,

12:01.296 --> 12:03.871
heir apparent to
the Queen of Country throne,

12:03.965 --> 12:07.300
until the fans find out
that she helped kill my mother.

12:07.452 --> 12:10.136
The law calls it
assisted suicide, but still,

12:10.288 --> 12:12.138
the press, social media?

12:12.290 --> 12:14.307
It'll be a feeding frenzy.

12:14.459 --> 12:16.717
(scoffs)

12:16.737 --> 12:20.797
Why in the world would you go
public with that kind of story?

12:20.966 --> 12:22.240
Oh, pack a lunch
and pitch a tent,

12:22.391 --> 12:24.242
'cause I'm just getting started.

12:27.489 --> 12:31.307
Before I turn myself in tonight,
I wanted to...

12:31.476 --> 12:34.085
talk to the two of you about
what happened that night

12:34.312 --> 12:36.570
that your daddy died.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.590
You mean the night
that you killed him?

12:38.741 --> 12:40.908
Dad tried to kill Mom, Tate.

12:41.002 --> 12:43.002
Tried to kill me, too.

12:43.154 --> 12:45.096
He left me no choice.

12:45.248 --> 12:46.747
Why should I believe you?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.341
'Cause I've never lied to you.

12:48.493 --> 12:50.176
And I ain't about to start now.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.271
I truly wish things would've
gone different that night,

12:53.348 --> 12:55.331
but that doesn't make me
any less sorry,

12:55.333 --> 12:58.668
because it's the two of you
that got hurt the most.

12:58.761 --> 13:00.594
You have no idea how I feel.

13:00.688 --> 13:02.839
Grampa's just trying
to tell us the truth.

13:02.932 --> 13:04.473
And he's going to prison for it.

13:04.475 --> 13:06.934
That's all right, Ace,
she's right.

13:07.028 --> 13:09.287
You know, the world believes

13:09.514 --> 13:11.681
that my job is to sing
and play guitar,

13:11.699 --> 13:15.535
but my real job
is to protect this family.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.279
And the thing I'll be thinking
on the most while I'm away

13:18.298 --> 13:21.132
is how I'm gonna
make this up to you two.

13:21.359 --> 13:24.618
But in the meantime...

13:24.638 --> 13:26.529
take care of each other.

13:26.548 --> 13:29.081
And don't forget,

13:29.233 --> 13:33.478
it's family first.

13:33.555 --> 13:36.105
Now and forever.

13:42.305 --> 13:44.989
Now, I know that Gigi's upset.

13:45.141 --> 13:48.475
But I can assure you
that the Romans do not like

13:48.570 --> 13:52.405
to air their dirty laundry
in public.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.482
That may be,
but I can't go forward

13:55.502 --> 13:59.653
on your assurances alone,
so I'm gonna have to...

13:59.747 --> 14:02.257
hit pause on the tour.

14:03.326 --> 14:05.826
-For how long?
-Six months.

14:06.029 --> 14:09.238
Six months? Well, that's not
"pause," I'd say that's "stop."

14:09.332 --> 14:12.108
Skyfair is
a multinational company

14:12.110 --> 14:14.001
with a variety of businesses,

14:14.095 --> 14:17.004
and if an artist
gets "canceled,"

14:17.023 --> 14:19.082
things can snowball
very quickly.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.585
I'm very sorry, Nicky, but...

14:22.678 --> 14:23.862
it's better this way.

14:24.089 --> 14:27.514
For who? For the shareholders
or... some hedge fund?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.258
'Cause it's certainly
not better for me.

14:29.277 --> 14:31.185
Well, I don't want
to have to remind you

14:31.279 --> 14:32.612
that it was my vote
that made the merger happen

14:32.764 --> 14:33.705
in the first place.

14:33.932 --> 14:35.781
Is that a threat?

14:35.934 --> 14:38.877

but no tour, no merger.

underestimates me from the jump.

So if you think
that you're calling my bluff,

14:49.781 --> 14:52.473

14:54.043 --> 14:56.043

28:53.958 --> 28:55.958

but...

28:55.976 --> 28:58.477
I didn't do it

29:13.193 --> 29:18.005
I don't think a tour is

29:21.260 --> 29:24.002

29:24.154 --> 29:25.929

29:26.098 --> 29:29.825
I doubled down,
I bet on myself, and

29:29.918 --> 29:31.584
nothing I tried worked.

29:31.678 --> 29:33.687
Well, then, maybe you
misunderstood my advice.

29:35.590 --> 29:37.757

29:58.798 --> 30:01.614
What's it like for everything

30:01.634 --> 30:05.469

30:09.124 --> 30:11.533
You don't want a merger.

30:11.552 --> 30:13.644
Goes away.

30:13.795 --> 30:14.886
Life does what you want

30:15.039 --> 30:18.206
without you lifting a finger.

30:18.225 --> 30:22.210
I suggest you go home
and sleep it off.

30:22.304 --> 30:23.895
Before you say something
you'll regret.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.715
No, I'm done with regret.
I'm tired of it.

30:26.808 --> 30:29.568
I'm tired of being judged.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.236
That's funny,
coming from a man

30:31.330 --> 30:33.905

his sister's wife.

knocked up the gardener.

Was she the caretaker?

This is not a road
you want to go down,

30:47.495 --> 30:49.513
I assure you.

30:49.664 --> 30:53.758
Oh, it looks like you want
to take a swing at me.

30:53.911 --> 30:55.686

Nicky...

33:15.052 --> 33:17.219
I don't know what to say.

33:17.237 --> 33:19.663
I think the word
you're looking for is "yes."

33:32.569 --> 33:34.011
<i> (knock on door)</i>

33:37.741 --> 33:40.017
Mr. Roman.

33:40.244 --> 33:42.335
I came here because there's
something I need to tell you

33:42.429 --> 33:44.354
about the man you just hired.

33:44.581 --> 33:45.930
You mean your son.

33:46.025 --> 33:47.673
Boy's been a pain in my ass

33:47.768 --> 33:50.085
since he was born,

33:50.178 --> 33:53.012
but he's damn good
at what he does.

33:53.032 --> 33:56.608
I never gave him a fair shake,

33:56.760 --> 33:58.702
and I hope you do.

33:58.853 --> 34:00.278
You're lucky to have him.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.706
Albie Roman, who knew under
that Stetson was nothing

34:02.933 --> 34:04.666
but a soft caramel center.

34:06.361 --> 34:10.121
And, Albie, when you're done
mourning your wife,

34:10.274 --> 34:12.532
I know a Dallas girl made good
who's still

34:12.609 --> 34:15.510
a sucker for cowboys.

34:27.066 --> 34:29.382
I'm sorry.

34:29.476 --> 34:31.217
Really I am, Geeg.

34:31.311 --> 34:34.813
I don't know why it
took me so long to say it.

34:34.965 --> 34:36.981
I know I could say it
every day

34:37.134 --> 34:39.301
for the rest of my life,

34:39.394 --> 34:42.496
and you'd be right
to never forgive me.

34:43.974 --> 34:45.565
I hope you can.

34:45.659 --> 34:47.250
Me, too.

34:48.903 --> 34:52.005
But today ain't that day.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.264
KAYLA:
He's beautiful, isn't he?

35:02.993 --> 35:04.267
Yeah, he is.

35:04.419 --> 35:07.345
Geeg...

35:07.439 --> 35:09.831
Don't.

35:09.850 --> 35:11.608
I love you,

35:11.835 --> 35:13.685
and I know I screwed up.

35:13.761 --> 35:17.447
Just take care of him,
and be there for him.

35:17.599 --> 35:19.841
He's gonna need you.

35:19.934 --> 35:22.894
What about you?

35:23.046 --> 35:25.163
What about us?

35:28.127 --> 35:30.669
I don't know.

35:43.458 --> 35:45.142
<i> ACE:</i>
<i> Your own tour, Mom?</i>
<i> That's awesome.</i>

35:45.369 --> 35:48.562
Now, are you sure that
you don't want to come? Hmm?

35:50.298 --> 35:51.815
I still haven't got
an opening act.

35:51.966 --> 35:53.725
Yeah, come on.
It'll be fun.

35:53.819 --> 35:57.637
I don't know. I think
I'm gonna stay with Grandpa.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.139
I don't like thinking of him
being all alone

36:00.233 --> 36:02.492
-in that big house.
-Oh, my God.

36:02.644 --> 36:04.477
You know, whatever I did right
in my life,

36:04.496 --> 36:06.663
I can see it in both of you.

36:08.392 --> 36:12.210
But, Mom, I do have an idea
for your opening act.

36:15.156 --> 36:17.323
-Hey.
-Oh.

36:17.342 --> 36:21.678
Note to self: next house
get a gate, or a moat.

36:21.905 --> 36:25.498
It's way too easy for y'all to
be popping around all the time.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.376
I saw Mackenzie from, um,
Open Horizon this morning.

36:28.503 --> 36:31.837
She offered me a...
a world tour.

36:31.932 --> 36:35.083
But me being me, I said, I said
she had to sweeten the deal.

36:35.101 --> 36:37.585
Nicky, if the credits roll
with you getting

36:37.679 --> 36:39.921
a happy ending while I end up
eating a frozen pizza

36:39.940 --> 36:42.757
crying myself to sleep alone,

36:42.776 --> 36:44.701
I'm not really sure
this is the amazing story

36:44.811 --> 36:46.277
that you think it is.

36:46.430 --> 36:49.497
I said I wouldn't take it
unless you were part of it.

36:51.526 --> 36:54.461
-As your opening act.
-No, co-headlining.

36:55.288 --> 36:56.713
The Roman Sisters Tour.

36:56.940 --> 36:57.881
You and me, equal billing.

36:58.032 --> 36:59.883
Taking the world by storm,

37:00.034 --> 37:01.593
like we used
to dream of as kids.

37:03.204 --> 37:06.056
Well, come on, say something.

37:08.042 --> 37:09.617
For real?

37:09.636 --> 37:10.894
Gigi, Mama was wrong.

37:11.045 --> 37:13.104
There can be two queens.
