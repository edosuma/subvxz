00:01.336 --> 00:02.869
Body Builder Week already, huh?

00:04.873 --> 00:07.040
Take it easy, Roller.

00:07.042 --> 00:09.175
- Let's talk.
- It's good to see you, D.

00:09.978 --> 00:12.112
I-It's good to see you, too.

00:12.114 --> 00:13.513
You know they couldn't just...

00:13.515 --> 00:15.548
They didn't have nothing to do
with Roller's attack.

00:15.550 --> 00:17.077
I know. I'm good.

00:17.079 --> 00:18.344
How can you be good?

00:18.346 --> 00:19.624
It's unfortunate.

00:19.626 --> 00:21.020
You know you sound
just like Uncle Daddy.

00:22.424 --> 00:24.591
What is going on?

00:24.593 --> 00:27.160
You know my whole crew
is going over to Glint.

00:27.162 --> 00:29.195
I was thinking maybe you wanted to run

00:29.197 --> 00:30.964
- Nail Artisans?
- Let's do it.

00:30.966 --> 00:32.932
You're gonna make an incredible wife.

00:34.336 --> 00:36.069
$150k.

00:36.071 --> 00:37.771
You got 24 hours.

00:37.773 --> 00:39.038
It came to me...

00:39.040 --> 00:42.163
who shot me... It was the Russians.

00:42.165 --> 00:45.169
He said it was your people
that tried to kill him.

00:45.194 --> 00:46.293
Bullshit.

00:46.295 --> 00:48.596
Roller was working for us.

00:48.598 --> 00:51.365
I know what you been up to
with Riva and her crew.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.000
Oh, you been busy, huh?

Ohh!

01:09.118 --> 01:10.618
What happened?

01:10.620 --> 01:12.920
My car broke down again...
Had to hitchhike a ride

01:12.922 --> 01:15.289
with a guy who look
like he was sauté my ass.

01:15.291 --> 01:16.791
Well, why didn't you call me?

01:16.793 --> 01:17.858
My cellphone is off.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.294
The bill is underneath
the jury duty summons,

01:20.296 --> 01:21.929
- which is in the trash.
- Oh, shit.

01:21.931 --> 01:25.866
We got to increase the foot
traffic down here, you know?

01:25.868 --> 01:28.602
I-I... Between the rent
and the payroll... thank you...

01:28.604 --> 01:30.604
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and Dean's needs, ah,

01:30.606 --> 01:33.307
this shit is tighter
than a fat woman's drawers.

01:33.309 --> 01:35.509
Well, listen, you know I've been running

01:35.511 --> 01:37.478
that Medicaid scam with the sen...

01:37.480 --> 01:39.113
- Stop it.
- With the seniors...

01:39.115 --> 01:40.247
- Ga ga.
- Lido Beach.

01:40.249 --> 01:42.716
- Z-Z-Zah. No...
- Ma'am?

01:47.990 --> 01:49.890
What's happening, ladies?

01:52.528 --> 01:54.528
Which one of y'all open for a manicure?

01:54.530 --> 01:56.864
Oh, well, we're all open, sugar.

01:56.866 --> 02:00.935
Y'all, this is Bryce's brother, Roller.

02:00.937 --> 02:02.236
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

02:02.238 --> 02:03.771
When you get back from Tallahassee?

02:03.773 --> 02:04.839
About two days ago.

02:04.841 --> 02:07.108
I'm Polly. Enchanté.

02:07.110 --> 02:09.676
Okay. Enchanté, then, Polly.

02:11.147 --> 02:13.180
You gonna take care of me, baby?

02:13.182 --> 02:15.349
I can. My section is right here.

02:15.351 --> 02:17.184
Don't tell me Uncle Daddy
has you working

02:17.186 --> 02:18.419
at that clinic already.

02:18.421 --> 02:19.987
Oh, you already know.

02:19.989 --> 02:22.156
They needed someone
with my talent for business,

02:22.158 --> 02:25.226
and I need some of these
businesses to align with ours,

02:25.228 --> 02:26.360
- so there you go.
- Mm-hmm.

02:26.362 --> 02:28.229
Y'all take cash or credit?

02:28.231 --> 02:30.731
We prefer cash and avoiding felonies.

02:30.733 --> 02:33.434
- Hey.
- This is Desna.

02:33.436 --> 02:35.469
All right, Desna.

02:35.471 --> 02:37.138
Mind if I call you "D"?

02:37.140 --> 02:40.207
You can call me whatever you
want as long as you tip big.

02:40.209 --> 02:41.308
Okay?

02:41.310 --> 02:42.676
Uh-huh!

02:42.678 --> 02:45.846
A lady about her paper. I like that.

02:47.650 --> 02:51.519
- Where are we going, Roller?
- Shh now, baby girl.

02:52.364 --> 02:55.156
We finna go clean out
all these bank accounts.

02:55.158 --> 02:59.293
Got to handle these Russians,
baby... get my business back.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.595
Roller been gone too long.

03:01.957 --> 03:04.165
Roller, that's crazy!

03:04.167 --> 03:06.433
Uncle Daddy is gonna notice.

03:07.635 --> 03:08.769
I bet.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.099
He's gonna think you've done it all,

03:11.101 --> 03:13.407
blew your head off from all the guilt.

03:14.877 --> 03:16.777
Wha...?

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

03:29.163 --> 03:31.959
Roller, everybody's
gonna be looking for me.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.300
That's a good point.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.070
That's a good...

03:45.441 --> 03:47.808
Why didn't my family look for me harder

03:47.810 --> 03:50.344
when I was being held by some
crazy opera-singing ho?

03:50.346 --> 03:51.912
Mr. Emerson,

03:51.914 --> 03:53.847
would you like some tea and crumpets

03:53.849 --> 03:56.383
while I slather your cock
with clotted cream?

03:56.385 --> 03:57.851
- What are talking about?!
- Huh?

03:57.853 --> 04:01.388
Yeah, you have no idea.

04:03.393 --> 04:05.793
You know what you're gonna do, Des?

04:06.896 --> 04:08.829
You're gonna call your little friends

04:09.399 --> 04:12.600
and tell 'em your big-timer plan
to blackmail me worked.

04:12.602 --> 04:16.070
You're gonna tell 'em you were
with your purdy doctor.

04:24.513 --> 04:26.714
I'm ain't taking the old
<i>Jet</i> magazines to Glint.

04:26.716 --> 04:27.648
All right, keep 'em here.

04:27.650 --> 04:29.149
I love me some <i>Jet.</i>

04:29.151 --> 04:31.986
So, Jenn, Uncle Daddy gonna go
after the Russians?

04:31.988 --> 04:33.721
Nah, they told him to stand down.

04:33.723 --> 04:35.389
Georgia doesn't want a war.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.161
Nail Artisans of Manatee County.

04:41.163 --> 04:44.665
It worked. Roller won't
kill us as long as we promise

04:44.667 --> 04:46.967
not to tell anyone about his embezzling.

04:46.969 --> 04:49.737
- He's just gonna drop it?
- That's what he said.

04:49.739 --> 04:52.387
I told him that if anything
happened to you or me,

04:52.889 --> 04:54.207
that y'all will go to Uncle Daddy

04:54.209 --> 04:56.376
and tell him that he'd been
stealing from him.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.813
Oh, my God, girl. I can't believe it.

04:59.815 --> 05:02.582
Yeah, y'all should go celebrate.

05:02.584 --> 05:05.318
Um, I know I am.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.321
I'm gonna... I'm gonna get
together with the doctor,

05:08.323 --> 05:13.360
and, uh, go have lamb chops
and ambrosia salad.

05:13.362 --> 05:15.395
Then I'm gonna fall on his cock.

05:15.397 --> 05:16.696
Ooh, girl!

05:16.698 --> 05:17.964
Make sure you tell Polly.

05:17.966 --> 05:20.133
I mean, well, and everybody.

05:20.135 --> 05:21.201
I've got to go.

05:21.203 --> 05:23.637
Okay, girl. Have fun.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.881
Is it because I'm half-Jewish?

05:34.883 --> 05:36.316
I'm not asking you to convert.

05:36.318 --> 05:37.384
No!

05:37.386 --> 05:39.219
It's just I don't want anything serious,

05:39.221 --> 05:42.055
so stop sending me flowers
and Edible Arrangements

05:42.057 --> 05:43.924
and teddy bears.

05:45.294 --> 05:47.627
You're acting too thirsty, boy.

05:47.629 --> 05:49.296
I am thirsty...

05:49.298 --> 05:52.065
Thirsty for you, thirsty for your love,

05:52.067 --> 05:54.501
thirsty for... for you
bouncing up and down on me

05:54.503 --> 05:56.369
reciting dirty Latin phrases.

05:57.485 --> 05:58.618
Bye.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.186
Carpe de...

06:00.188 --> 06:01.587
Shut up, Jenn.

06:01.589 --> 06:03.189
Polly, great news.

06:03.191 --> 06:06.025
So, I talked to Des, and
Roller's not gonna kill me.

06:06.027 --> 06:08.427
Will you shut your fat mouth?

06:08.429 --> 06:10.763
What? She can't hear me.
She got her ear buds.

06:10.765 --> 06:12.064
Hey, girl. See?

06:12.066 --> 06:14.333
Okay. And how is Des?

06:14.335 --> 06:16.302
Oh, she's good. Roller's not
gonna kill her either.

06:16.304 --> 06:19.205
Okay. Tell me exactly what she said.

06:19.207 --> 06:22.575
Okay. Well, she said she's
gonna fall on Ruval's cock.

06:22.577 --> 06:23.976
Desna said "cock"?

06:23.978 --> 06:26.712
It's a new day, girl.
I didn't ask questions.

06:26.714 --> 06:28.314
Don't even touch it!

06:28.316 --> 06:29.348
No, ma'am.

06:29.350 --> 06:31.684
What? O-kay.

06:31.686 --> 06:33.152
Relax.

06:35.657 --> 06:37.790
Desna said "Cock"?

06:37.792 --> 06:39.058
I know.

06:39.060 --> 06:41.093
She usually says "big-ass dick."

06:41.095 --> 06:42.695
Hmm.

06:42.697 --> 06:45.131
Hey, come on over, sugar.

06:49.037 --> 06:50.770

07:27.608 --> 07:29.008
Go on, Roller. Wait.

07:29.010 --> 07:30.509
O-Or what we could do...

07:30.511 --> 07:33.079
We... we could just call

a-and we could... we could...

07:34.982 --> 07:37.349

I mean, you his baby boy.

07:39.687 --> 07:41.887
He will understand.

07:41.889 --> 07:46.025
No baby boys... Bryce his baby boy now.

07:46.861 --> 07:48.894
All of y'all moved on without me.

07:48.896 --> 07:50.096
That's not true.

07:50.098 --> 07:51.397
Quit your lyin'.

07:54.102 --> 07:55.434
I bet that boy is soft.

Yeah, you jealous, Roller,

08:14.088 --> 08:15.387
You ain't got to do this.

08:15.389 --> 08:16.756
Whoo!

08:18.092 --> 08:19.959

08:31.405 --> 08:33.938
<i>Oh, it's the pink dick, isn't it?</i>

08:33.941 --> 08:35.508
<i>What's wrong with a pink dick?</i>

08:35.510 --> 08:36.342
<i>She wants a black dick.</i>

08:36.344 --> 08:37.876
<i>Okay, "she" can hear you.</i>

08:37.879 --> 08:40.746
<i>Don't tell me what kind of
dick I want, okay?</i>

08:40.748 --> 08:44.383
<i>I just don't have time for some
corny-ass gangsta wannabe.</i>

08:44.385 --> 08:47.520

<i>Well, we could double date.</i>

09:02.103 --> 09:03.903
<i>Or we could not.</i>

09:03.905 --> 09:07.807
<i>Hmm. I'd snuggle up to a pink
dick if I got a gold watch.</i>

<i>Damn.</i>

09:46.447 --> 09:48.006
<i>Y'all some real gangsters up in here.</i>

09:48.616 --> 09:50.316
<i>Shut up.</i>

09:51.479 --> 09:54.948
Showtime, baby.
Put a smile on that face, huh?

09:55.851 --> 09:57.384
Can I tell y'all a secret?

09:57.386 --> 10:00.353
You're my first customers ever.
Thank you for that.

10:00.355 --> 10:01.588
Now how may I help you?

10:01.590 --> 10:05.505
Um... I would like to make a withdrawal.

10:07.048 --> 10:08.595
You look so familiar.

10:08.597 --> 10:10.063
You go to First AME church?

10:10.065 --> 10:12.799
No, I don't... I don't go to FAME.

10:12.801 --> 10:13.867
I...

10:13.869 --> 10:18.572
I got to Holy Ezekiel
Lutheran Presbyterian.

10:18.574 --> 10:19.873
H-E-L-P?

10:19.875 --> 10:21.308
That's right. HELP.

10:22.477 --> 10:23.944
I ain't ever heard of that one.

10:23.946 --> 10:26.212
Sugar dumpling, let's pick up
the pace a little.

10:26.214 --> 10:28.582
Our little girl,
she's got a dance recital.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.684
She move just like Mama.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.786
I'll take that.

10:35.190 --> 10:38.525
Thank you, Rochelle.
We'll see you at church.

10:38.527 --> 10:40.260
Come on, baby.

10:54.476 --> 10:56.242
Oh, shit. I got to go.

10:56.244 --> 10:57.611
No! No!

10:57.613 --> 10:59.679
I can't be late for work.

10:59.681 --> 11:01.314
Oh, no. Just...

11:01.316 --> 11:02.315
Okay.

11:02.317 --> 11:03.550
Mm.

11:03.552 --> 11:05.218
- I have an idea.
- Okay.

11:05.220 --> 11:09.022
I'll start the shower,
you grab some toys.

11:09.024 --> 11:11.491
You can shave me, and we'll play.

11:11.493 --> 11:13.026
We can kill two birds.

11:13.028 --> 11:14.194
Mwah!

11:14.196 --> 11:15.862
- Come on.
- Okay.

11:26.308 --> 11:29.275
Oh, no.

11:47.195 --> 11:48.495
Where y'all at?

11:48.497 --> 11:49.963
I'm coming!

12:03.101 --> 12:04.401
Uncle Daddy, I need to talk to you.

12:04.403 --> 12:05.935
Everything okay at the clinic?

12:05.937 --> 12:07.804
Yeah.

12:07.806 --> 12:08.972
Um, I've been thinking.

12:08.974 --> 12:10.640
Now, hear me out, all right?

12:12.010 --> 12:14.277
Now we're asking the universe

12:14.279 --> 12:16.579
to help us reach our full potential

12:16.581 --> 12:19.723
to become the largest pill
distributors along the Gulf Coast.

12:19.725 --> 12:22.886
Now it's the moments of the decision

12:22.888 --> 12:25.021
that our destiny is made.

12:26.525 --> 12:28.625
We made a decision out of fear,

12:29.065 --> 12:31.461
and that fear will hamper our success.

12:31.860 --> 12:33.157
Would you cut your jibber jabber?

12:33.159 --> 12:35.632
What's your point?

12:35.634 --> 12:38.935
Roller's right.
We got to go after the Russians.

12:41.202 --> 12:44.574
Roller's a hothead.
He's just acting out.

12:45.415 --> 12:47.077
Ted's looking at the bigger picture.

12:47.079 --> 12:48.778
That's why we stand down.

12:50.582 --> 12:53.083
I'm looking at the big picture, too.

12:53.085 --> 12:54.584
If we don't retaliate,

12:54.586 --> 12:56.686
the Russians are just
gonna see us as weak.

12:57.956 --> 13:01.257
You just get upgraded,
and now you know the game?

13:03.766 --> 13:06.296
We got to protect our own, Uncle Daddy.

13:06.298 --> 13:07.864
An eye for an eye, right?

13:07.866 --> 13:10.934
That's why you took out
my daddy's killer.

13:14.139 --> 13:17.373
We have to do this.

13:18.643 --> 13:20.610
All right.

13:22.382 --> 13:24.247
I'll call the bossman in Georgia,

13:24.249 --> 13:27.117
and we'll... we'll have a sit-down.

13:27.119 --> 13:29.586
Thank you, thank you, Uncle Daddy.

13:29.588 --> 13:32.589
Something doesn't feel right.

13:33.254 --> 13:35.592
Could it be, A, Roller
coming back from the dead,

13:35.594 --> 13:37.961
B, Roller's being shaken down
by the Russians,

13:37.963 --> 13:42.499
or, C, uh, my husband
going full Mafioso?

13:42.501 --> 13:43.800
Oh.

13:43.802 --> 13:46.803
No, I think it's option D.
Something feels off about Desna.

13:46.805 --> 13:48.171
Hmm.

13:48.173 --> 13:51.541
I can't believe that Roller just
accepted her terms, you know?

13:51.543 --> 13:53.009
Yeah.

13:53.011 --> 13:54.377
Maybe I should call her.

13:54.379 --> 13:55.879
Talk to me, Roller.

13:55.881 --> 13:58.748
We can work this thing out
the way we used to do together.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.250
I-I won't judge you.

14:00.252 --> 14:02.152
...from a mixtape.

14:02.617 --> 14:03.853
Well, this shit is not about a mix...

14:03.855 --> 14:06.089
There's got to be more to it than that.

14:06.091 --> 14:08.458
There isn't. Get in the car.

14:18.803 --> 14:20.870
<i>How you doin', D?</i>

14:20.872 --> 14:23.373
<i>Same shit, different day.</i>

14:23.375 --> 14:25.909
<i>How's the pen treating old Polly Bird?</i>

14:27.145 --> 14:29.512
<i>It's hard. I got a friend</i>

14:29.514 --> 14:32.115
<i>who says that she will protect
her on the inside</i>

14:32.117 --> 14:35.151
<i>if I give her $300 a week,
which I do not have.</i>

14:35.153 --> 14:37.453
<i>You know what you need, D?</i>

14:37.455 --> 14:39.122
<i>My ass need $300 a week.</i>

14:39.124 --> 14:41.057
<i>Nah, you need a little distraction.</i>

14:41.823 --> 14:44.727
<i>Take your mind off of all
of this stuff, you know?</i>

14:44.729 --> 14:45.862
<i>Mm.</i>

14:45.864 --> 14:47.564
<i>You're not hearing me.</i>

14:47.566 --> 14:50.500
<i>D, I'm talking about one drink.</i>

14:50.915 --> 14:51.968
<i>How 'bout it?</i>

14:52.542 --> 14:55.405
<i>Lift your spirits up,
feel a little better.</i>

14:55.407 --> 14:57.707
<i>It don't have to be an
official date or anything.</i>

14:57.709 --> 15:01.444
<i>I mean, it's two regular folk
who work at the same strip mall</i>

15:02.343 --> 15:05.715
<i>getting a little bit of food...
me and you.</i>

15:11.022 --> 15:13.923
Roller, look, whatever you hiding,

15:13.925 --> 15:15.391
whatever you did,

15:15.393 --> 15:18.061
I-I know you probably
had a good reason for it,

15:18.063 --> 15:21.931
and if you tell Uncle Daddy...
I mean, he loves you.

15:21.933 --> 15:23.266
I know he'll forgive you.

15:23.268 --> 15:24.734
I know what you trying to do.

15:24.736 --> 15:27.837
No, it's true.
He... He's crazy about you.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.807
Y-You should have saw him
when you were gone.

15:30.809 --> 15:32.175
He was a broken man.

15:33.378 --> 15:35.378
- Shit.
- What is that?

15:35.380 --> 15:36.946
- I don't know.
- You hit something?

15:36.948 --> 15:38.014
No.

15:38.016 --> 15:39.215
Shit. Pull over.

15:40.318 --> 15:42.175
Pull the goddamn car over!

15:50.100 --> 15:51.900
Shit.

15:54.772 --> 15:57.539
You crazy bitch.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.885
W...

16:09.887 --> 16:13.589
You just gonna keep untying me
every time we go to a bank?

16:14.145 --> 16:15.344
Ow!

16:15.346 --> 16:16.979
Sit here. Keep your mouth shut.

16:16.981 --> 16:18.847
Roller, that's too tight!

16:20.217 --> 16:24.887
<i>I will put you down.</i>

16:24.889 --> 16:26.755
Shut your mouth!

16:26.757 --> 16:28.857
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

16:33.531 --> 16:35.431
What?

16:35.433 --> 16:37.032
What is wrong with you?

16:42.706 --> 16:44.239
It's not your fault!

16:45.609 --> 16:46.742
You did this.

16:46.744 --> 16:47.976
You did all of this.

16:47.978 --> 16:50.145
I'm not the one who shot you.

16:50.147 --> 16:52.848
Virginia was just trying
to save your ass.

16:52.850 --> 16:55.484
No, she... she...
she... she had my back.

16:55.486 --> 16:57.486
What'd you want me to do?

16:58.823 --> 17:00.823
Who had my back?

17:06.097 --> 17:07.963
<i>What?</i>

17:07.964 --> 17:09.431
<i>Cheers to us.</i>

17:09.433 --> 17:11.934
<i>Oh, I'ma still working on this one.</i>

17:11.935 --> 17:13.202
<i>Then work harder.</i>

17:13.204 --> 17:14.636
<i>Okay!</i>

17:15.226 --> 17:16.905
<i>Mmm!</i>

17:16.906 --> 17:19.775
<i>So finish telling me about your uncle.</i>

17:20.189 --> 17:21.844
<i>Uncle Daddy?</i>

17:21.846 --> 17:25.079
<i>Yeah, so my pop and Uncle Daddy...</i>

17:25.082 --> 17:26.582
<i>They were thick as thieves.</i>

17:26.584 --> 17:27.883
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

17:27.885 --> 17:29.985
<i>Yeah. Basically, we ran up
and down the Gulf Coast</i>

17:29.987 --> 17:32.888
<i>'cause they had a few
little humble spots they ran...</i>

17:35.371 --> 17:38.327
<i>...and, uh, some punk got
in it in his head...</i>

17:38.329 --> 17:42.295
<i>believe it or not...
that my pops owed him money,</i>

17:43.334 --> 17:44.714
<i>and he, uh...</i>

17:46.137 --> 17:48.003
<i>he gunned down my family</i>

17:48.467 --> 17:51.373
<i>in front of the church
where we used to go as kids.</i>

17:52.943 --> 17:54.376
<i>And that's it.</i>

17:54.378 --> 17:57.079
<i>And then Uncle Daddy scooped me up,</i>

17:57.081 --> 17:58.714
<i>put me under his wing.</i>

17:58.716 --> 18:01.355
<i>What about you? What about your folks?</i>

18:02.356 --> 18:03.552
<i>Not really around.</i>

18:03.554 --> 18:05.254
<i>Cheers to foster care.</i>

18:05.902 --> 18:06.955
<i>Cheers.</i>

18:07.653 --> 18:13.395
<i>So, you just straight up drug dealer?</i>

18:13.397 --> 18:15.497
<i>Not at all. No, no, no.</i>

18:15.499 --> 18:17.132
<i>No, no, no?</i>

18:17.134 --> 18:18.567
<i>We just give a bunch of pills</i>

18:18.569 --> 18:19.968
<i>to a bunch of people
who don't really need 'em.</i>

18:19.970 --> 18:21.870
<i>That's how you gonna cover that?</i>

18:21.872 --> 18:22.905
<i>Oh.</i>

18:22.907 --> 18:24.006
<i>What you need, girl?</i>

18:24.008 --> 18:25.407
<i>I got it.</i>

18:25.409 --> 18:27.209
<i>You can't get me what I need.</i>

18:27.211 --> 18:28.465
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

18:28.467 --> 18:29.478
<i>That's right.</i>

18:32.283 --> 18:34.216
<i>Okay.</i>

18:34.218 --> 18:36.018
<i>You know what?</i>

18:36.020 --> 18:39.555
<i>A couple glasses of champagne
in a strip club is not a date.</i>

18:39.557 --> 18:42.858
<i>If you think it is, you out your mind.</i>

18:42.860 --> 18:44.092
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:45.169 --> 18:46.762
<i>I am.</i>

18:49.280 --> 18:51.213
<i>I am.</i>

18:52.636 --> 18:55.604
You cost me my place
in the jungle, baby.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.341
Now Bryce got that old El Chapo
feeling in his veins.

18:59.343 --> 19:02.544
So, what you gonna do?
Y-Y-You just gonna give up?

19:02.546 --> 19:04.513
That's not you, Roller!

19:11.889 --> 19:13.355
You folks okay?

19:13.357 --> 19:16.692
No! No, I'm not okay! Help me! Please!

19:18.162 --> 19:19.828
All right.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.531
- You guys be careful now.
- What?

19:22.533 --> 19:25.400
It's a dangerous road...
a lot of texting and driving.

19:25.402 --> 19:26.702
Have a nice day, y'all.

19:26.704 --> 19:28.604
W-What you mean, "Have a nice day"?!

19:28.606 --> 19:30.572
I'm being held hostage!

19:30.574 --> 19:32.708
Oh! Tell your uncle I said hi.

19:32.710 --> 19:35.277
You Hussers are into some crazy shit.

19:35.279 --> 19:38.046
His uncle?! Get back here!

19:38.619 --> 19:40.349
Shit!

19:41.418 --> 19:43.218
I still need some banks.

19:43.220 --> 19:44.253
Time's a-tickin'.

19:47.825 --> 19:49.558
I don't know if I can
afford it over there.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.793
Vista Verde is way
out of my price range.

19:51.795 --> 19:53.528
I don't even know if I could spell it.

19:53.530 --> 19:54.730
Okay, French is tough.

19:54.732 --> 19:56.765
It's not Fren...

19:56.767 --> 19:59.635
Anyway, we will hook up all
our loyal clients, won't we?

19:59.637 --> 20:00.936
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.070
I need to talk to you.

20:02.072 --> 20:03.338
Sure, baby.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.907
Uh, Jenn, would you mind starting Marge?

20:05.909 --> 20:07.376
You know I love me some Marge.

20:07.378 --> 20:09.077
- Come on, Jenn.
- Marge.

20:09.079 --> 20:10.445
How's it going?

20:11.949 --> 20:14.116
What? What is it? What's going on?

20:18.584 --> 20:20.522
Arlene's getting a warrant
to arrest Desna

20:20.524 --> 20:22.190
for setting up the Coombses.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.661
Wait, back up the truck.
You're still dating that cop?

20:25.958 --> 20:27.462
Desna told you to cut bait.

20:27.464 --> 20:28.864
I love her, Polly.

20:28.866 --> 20:31.133
Love? What love got to do with it?

20:31.135 --> 20:32.548
This is Desna we're talking about.

20:33.174 --> 20:35.137
Okay, when... when is this going down?

20:35.139 --> 20:36.138
Sometime today.

20:36.140 --> 20:37.511
Today?

20:38.262 --> 20:40.876
Okay. Uh, ah, what does she have on her?

20:41.515 --> 20:44.813
She found Desna's broken nail
on Roller's dock.

20:45.353 --> 20:47.816
But the most damaging piece...

20:47.818 --> 20:51.320
the DCF paperwork placing Desna

20:51.322 --> 20:53.422
as foster child of the Coombses.

20:53.424 --> 20:55.424
Okay. Well, then Arlene's got to go.

20:55.426 --> 20:56.925
I can't do that. Mnh-mnh.

20:56.927 --> 20:58.226
I can't. I can't.

20:58.228 --> 21:00.595
I know, I know, but look,
when... when... when...

21:00.597 --> 21:02.898
when Dodi Fayed left me
for Princess Diana,

21:02.900 --> 21:04.399
I didn't think I'd ever...

21:04.401 --> 21:05.767
Are you kidding me?!

21:05.769 --> 21:08.236
This isn't one of your
bullshit stories, Polly!

21:08.238 --> 21:09.571
This is my life!

21:13.214 --> 21:15.610
For the first time, somebody gets me,

21:15.612 --> 21:17.546
and I can be myself, Polly,

21:17.548 --> 21:21.149
and we talk, and not some
bullshit small talk...

21:21.151 --> 21:22.818
real stuff!

21:23.265 --> 21:26.521
She knows that me
and my brother don't speak.

21:26.523 --> 21:28.490
She knows about the shit
with my parents.

21:28.492 --> 21:30.359
She doesn't care that I was in prison.

21:30.361 --> 21:32.060
And what I told her what I had to do

21:32.062 --> 21:35.664
to survive in there,
she didn't judge me.

21:37.780 --> 21:40.769
We even talk about having a kid.

21:40.771 --> 21:44.039
Desna has done more for us
than our own family.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.775
I know, I know, I know.

21:46.777 --> 21:49.945
Whose couch did you sleep on
when you couldn't pay rent?

21:49.947 --> 21:51.246
Hmm?

21:51.248 --> 21:54.249
Who gave you a job when
no one would hire a felon?

21:54.251 --> 21:55.917
And most importantly,

21:55.919 --> 21:57.419
who nursed you back to health

21:57.421 --> 21:59.521
when that crazy bitch stabbed you?

21:59.523 --> 22:01.490
I-I... I love her.

22:01.492 --> 22:02.858
I can't do it. I just can't.

22:02.860 --> 22:04.292
- Just... Yeah, listen.
- I can't! I can't!

22:04.294 --> 22:06.962
Listen to me! Listen, we are
all going down for this.

22:07.435 --> 22:09.464
Please don't put me back in jail.

22:20.823 --> 22:25.981
Arlene was suspended for a DUI.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.886
Okay.

22:32.289 --> 22:34.823
I can work with that.

22:54.899 --> 22:56.578
Boy, you all right?

22:56.580 --> 22:59.047
Just a little... a little anxious.

22:59.049 --> 23:01.149
Have yourself a pill here.

23:01.151 --> 23:02.951
Calm down, you're making my ass itch.

23:02.953 --> 23:05.787
No, thank you. I'm... I can calm down.

23:05.789 --> 23:08.924
You better, 'cause this is important.

23:08.926 --> 23:10.625
Listen to me.

23:10.627 --> 23:12.561
The bossman arrives,
you let me do the talking.

23:12.563 --> 23:13.929
You just shut up, you hear me?

23:13.931 --> 23:17.499
What a lovely place you have.
Trans strippers?

23:17.501 --> 23:19.568
Very progressive.

23:20.257 --> 23:21.837
Good. I appreciate that, Ted.

23:21.839 --> 23:23.004
Listen, we can arrange...

23:23.006 --> 23:24.739
I got to make this quick, Clay.

23:24.741 --> 23:28.474
I'm in town speaking at the
candle manufacturers convention.

23:29.046 --> 23:30.512
All righty, then.

23:31.185 --> 23:31.847
This little beef I...

23:31.849 --> 23:34.483
Wait. Wait, wait. Clay, use the stick.

23:34.485 --> 23:35.898
Stick?

23:36.587 --> 23:38.653
It's a sharing stick.

23:39.026 --> 23:42.157
You can only speak if you're holding it.

23:44.782 --> 23:47.362
Well, that's a...
It's a very nice stick, Ted.

23:47.364 --> 23:49.698
Um... is that blood?

23:52.302 --> 23:55.637
Somebody didn't follow the
rules, and I lost my temper.

23:56.085 --> 23:57.639
Well, Ted, this is about the Russians.

23:57.641 --> 23:59.774
- All right, we...
- You're not holding the stick,

23:59.776 --> 24:01.910
you don't speak.

24:01.912 --> 24:04.946
We're not children, for Christ's sake.

24:04.948 --> 24:08.633
Listen, th... this misunderstanding...

24:08.635 --> 24:11.219
Man, if it was about business,
I'd let it go.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.823
But they shot my boy.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.116
Tough shit.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.365
We can't afford to have cops
snooping around

24:23.367 --> 24:26.902
or anything that threatens our
understanding with the Haitians,

24:26.904 --> 24:29.070
the Cubans, Palmetto drag queens,

24:29.072 --> 24:32.374
which is what would happen
if we attack the Russians.

24:32.663 --> 24:34.643
Stop being a goddamn pussy!

24:34.645 --> 24:36.611
Jesus. Ahh! Ow!

24:36.613 --> 24:38.413
Jesus, what the... Ted?

24:38.415 --> 24:39.514
Stop it!

24:39.516 --> 24:41.082
Ow!

24:41.084 --> 24:44.019
<i>You move that photo,
I'll blow your brains out.</i>

24:44.021 --> 24:46.421
<i>- Okay. Okay.</i>
- Phew!

24:47.925 --> 24:49.925
<i>We'll be out of here
in a couple of hours.</i>

24:52.796 --> 24:57.065
Clay, Clay, Clay, 'cause you
make me so damn much money,

24:57.067 --> 24:59.968
I'm not gonna gut you all
like the wild animals you are,

24:59.970 --> 25:01.336
but if any of you Hussers

25:01.338 --> 25:04.506
so much as utters the word
"Russians" to me again,

25:04.508 --> 25:06.241
I will skin you alive

25:06.243 --> 25:09.878
and turn you into a Husser
candle collection.

25:19.222 --> 25:21.089
Namaste.

25:21.629 --> 25:23.191
Namaste.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.194
Bryce!

25:33.270 --> 25:34.600
Ted?

25:39.209 --> 25:40.308
Shit.

25:40.310 --> 25:41.977
No...

25:46.617 --> 25:48.149
Ahh!

25:48.151 --> 25:49.951
Shut up, Bryce.

26:05.936 --> 26:07.769
That's freedom, baby.

26:07.771 --> 26:09.638
Freedom.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.607
I just got to pay
these Olsen twins back now.

26:22.552 --> 26:23.818
Who's that? Wh...

26:23.820 --> 26:25.220
Pfft!

26:26.712 --> 26:30.089
_

26:35.198 --> 26:38.033
They changed the meet-up place.

26:41.104 --> 26:43.705
It's at the old theme park
off of Holland.

26:44.253 --> 26:45.573
Why?

26:47.356 --> 26:49.077
They're gonna kill me.

26:49.079 --> 26:51.012
They finna kill me.

26:51.552 --> 26:54.215
Wait a minute, Roll.
You don't know that.

26:54.217 --> 26:56.151
- They finna kill me.
- You don't know...

26:56.153 --> 26:57.686
Yes, I do! Drive!

26:57.854 --> 27:00.021
Just drive!

27:00.023 --> 27:01.523
Shit.

27:03.053 --> 27:04.331
Sh...

27:04.900 --> 27:07.367
Sh... sh... sh.

27:07.369 --> 27:10.470
That why they wanted a lump sum, huh?

27:13.209 --> 27:15.142
I should have seen this shit coming.

27:33.929 --> 27:36.463
Why so quiet, Desna?

27:36.465 --> 27:38.432
'Cause I don't have shit to say, Roller.

27:38.434 --> 27:40.434
I already said we should
call Uncle Daddy,

27:40.436 --> 27:42.135
but your black ass won't listen.

27:42.137 --> 27:43.937
All out of ideas?

27:43.939 --> 27:45.739
Huh?

27:45.741 --> 27:47.357
Call Uncle Daddy.

27:48.358 --> 27:50.510
That's it. That's all.

27:58.053 --> 27:59.453
What'd you do?

28:03.292 --> 28:05.926
What? I didn't do nothin'!

28:07.429 --> 28:09.463
What did you do, you stupid bitch?

28:09.465 --> 28:10.330
Huh?

28:10.332 --> 28:12.165
- Roller, please!
- Huh?

28:12.167 --> 28:13.567
Don't lie to me.

28:14.770 --> 28:16.703
What'd you do?! Huh?

28:16.705 --> 28:19.439
I told Riva that you blamed them
for your murder,

28:19.441 --> 28:21.608
and then Jones gonna retaliate, Roller.

28:21.610 --> 28:24.745
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

28:24.747 --> 28:26.680
Roller, please!

28:26.682 --> 28:29.116
Pull the car over! Pull the car over.

28:35.057 --> 28:37.090
Come on, I just need five benzos.

28:37.092 --> 28:38.492
That's all.

28:38.494 --> 28:41.461
Please... Quiet Ann and I...
We got to do this thing.

28:41.463 --> 28:43.397
I'm a medical doctor.
I can get in trouble.

28:43.399 --> 28:45.766
You're a Persian Escobar
in a strip mall.

28:45.768 --> 28:46.933
I'm Lebanese.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.435
You're just doing this

28:48.437 --> 28:50.671
because I said I wasn't ready
for a relationship.

28:50.673 --> 28:52.539
You're right.
That's exactly why I'm doing it.

28:52.541 --> 28:54.508
Well, I could never love a man
who holds a grudge.

28:54.510 --> 28:56.376
You could never love me ever.

28:58.347 --> 29:02.349
I made you cum
in Uncle Daddy's shower stall.

29:02.351 --> 29:03.283
Okay.

29:03.285 --> 29:05.085
Your toes curled up like snails.

29:05.087 --> 29:06.444
Like...

29:06.446 --> 29:07.754
You don't get it.

29:07.756 --> 29:09.334
- You won't let me.
- I'm scared!

29:09.336 --> 29:10.734
Of what?

29:10.736 --> 29:13.327
Polly, love is natural.

29:13.777 --> 29:16.396
It's the only reason
we don't kill ourselves.

29:19.564 --> 29:21.368
Can't we just talk about this later

29:21.370 --> 29:23.236
and you just give me the pills?

29:23.238 --> 29:26.239
So, you're saying there's
a later, like a date?

29:26.241 --> 29:29.042
Fine. Yes. Are you satisfied?

29:35.050 --> 29:38.719
Here. This is my personal stash, okay?

29:44.560 --> 29:47.327
Oh. You like me.

29:47.329 --> 29:50.330
Right now you like me.

29:50.332 --> 29:51.365
Wait.

29:51.367 --> 29:52.599
Sally Field... I thought she said,

29:52.601 --> 29:54.101
"You like me, you really, really"...

29:54.103 --> 29:56.370
No. Shut up. She said what I just said.

30:33.642 --> 30:35.909
Doesn't that sound romantic?

30:35.911 --> 30:38.345
A weekend camping trip
in the Everglades?

30:38.347 --> 30:40.947
We could finish talking about the kid,

30:40.949 --> 30:44.351
I could maybe convince you to
introduce you to your parents

30:44.353 --> 30:45.919
and persuade you to move in.

30:45.921 --> 30:47.554
Wouldn't you love that?

30:48.791 --> 30:51.224
Buying matching pots and pans,

30:51.226 --> 30:52.459
and building Ikea furniture.

31:33.502 --> 31:36.236
Damn it.

31:36.238 --> 31:37.671
If the Dixie Mafia finds out about this,

31:37.673 --> 31:39.239
we're deader than an A-rab at a rodeo.

31:39.241 --> 31:42.175
Get him in here.

31:42.177 --> 31:43.376
It's...

31:43.378 --> 31:45.812
Geez.

31:48.250 --> 31:50.570
- All right.
- I... Wait.

31:50.572 --> 31:52.419
Put a... Put a wall of chicken
nuggets around him.

31:52.421 --> 31:53.653
Chicken nuggets. No, no!

31:53.655 --> 31:55.288
I eat the chicken nuggets. Get... Here.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.190
Okra poppers, use that, okra poppers

32:00.462 --> 32:02.128
All right, get th... Come on.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.864
- I'm gonna get...
- Daddy?

32:03.866 --> 32:05.799
Hey, hold... Hold on.

32:05.801 --> 32:07.934
I got a... I got a phone call. Hold on.

32:07.936 --> 32:10.136
Oh, shit. Okay.

32:11.773 --> 32:14.174
Hey! What... what... what...
what's up, baby?

32:14.176 --> 32:16.843
Hey, hey. I was just thinking

32:16.845 --> 32:19.913
we should just go to
dinner tonight and we can talk.

32:19.915 --> 32:21.848
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
No, no. M-Maybe dinner.

32:21.850 --> 32:24.484
Yeah, I'm just, uh...
just a little busy.

32:25.052 --> 32:27.053
You sound wired.

32:27.345 --> 32:28.555
Are you using again?

32:28.557 --> 32:29.856
No, I'm...

32:29.858 --> 32:31.791
I j... I just can't explain right now.

32:31.793 --> 32:34.394
I-I got stuff to do.
I'm... I'm in a freezer.

32:34.770 --> 32:37.430
You're in a f... a freezer? Why?

32:37.432 --> 32:41.268
I c... I can explain
later, o... okay? I just...

32:41.270 --> 32:42.502
I just can't right now, okay?

32:42.504 --> 32:44.437
I can explain later.

32:48.992 --> 32:50.944
Everything all right, girl?

32:50.946 --> 32:52.788
No, it blows.

32:53.448 --> 32:54.956
I'm gonna take a break.

33:01.390 --> 33:03.957
I just know he's using again.

33:03.959 --> 33:07.794
And I... I... I don't know
what to do about it.

33:08.564 --> 33:10.864
Well, there's nothing
you can do about it.

33:10.866 --> 33:12.198
Yeah, I know.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.400
I'm sorry.

33:13.402 --> 33:14.868
It's all right.

33:16.905 --> 33:18.705
It's just like I don't...

33:19.231 --> 33:20.674
I don't know how much more I can take.

33:20.676 --> 33:22.342
He's not even talking to me.

33:24.813 --> 33:30.350
My first marriage we kept
everything inside for so long,

33:30.352 --> 33:32.419
and by the time we finally got
it all out,

33:32.421 --> 33:37.524
it was... it was... it was too late.

33:42.397 --> 33:44.164
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.366
I'm fine. I'm fine.

33:46.368 --> 33:48.034
I'm fine.

33:54.242 --> 33:55.809
I'm sorry.

34:07.923 --> 34:10.056
Shit.

34:10.058 --> 34:11.725
Shit.

34:31.045 --> 34:32.812
I figured it out.

34:32.813 --> 34:34.080
Good.

34:34.081 --> 34:36.650
So we gonna call Uncle Daddy, right?

34:36.652 --> 34:37.884
No.

34:37.886 --> 34:40.020
You gonna jump back on that 310.

34:40.022 --> 34:41.187
What?

34:41.188 --> 34:42.989
You... you just said...
to the theme park?

34:42.991 --> 34:45.225
You said you... you thought they
were gonna try to kill you.

34:45.226 --> 34:47.661
Change of plans, baby.

34:48.496 --> 34:51.097
Life's a roller coaster after all, huh?

34:59.683 --> 35:00.996
<i>H... Hey, Deanie.</i>

35:00.998 --> 35:02.765
<i>What you doing up so early, baby?</i>

35:02.767 --> 35:06.168
<i>I had a bad dream. Gryphons.</i>

35:07.472 --> 35:09.271
<i>Dean, this is Roller.
Roller, that's Dean.</i>

35:09.273 --> 35:11.173
<i>- He was just leaving, Dean.
- What happening, man?</i>

35:11.175 --> 35:12.375
<i>- N-No!
- No, no, no.</i>

35:12.377 --> 35:13.676
<i>- No, no.
- Okay.</i>

35:13.678 --> 35:15.745
<i>A rat!</i>

35:15.747 --> 35:17.146
<i>I-I hate rats! I-I hate rats!</i>

35:17.148 --> 35:18.147
<i>I hate rats!</i>

35:18.149 --> 35:18.914
<i>Get it!</i>

35:18.916 --> 35:20.649
<i>I hate rats!</i>

35:20.651 --> 35:21.851
<i>I know, I know. Calm down.</i>

35:21.853 --> 35:23.252
<i>Give me the book!</i>

35:23.254 --> 35:25.187
<i>Give me the big book. I'll get the rat.</i>

35:25.189 --> 35:26.622
<i>Yeah, I'll get it, I'll get it.</i>

35:26.624 --> 35:27.890
<i>G-G-Get the rat! Hurry up!</i>

35:27.892 --> 35:29.225
<i>Dean, you need to calm down!</i>

35:29.227 --> 35:31.060
<i>Get him!</i>

35:31.062 --> 35:32.695
<i>- Dean.
- He's gonna get the rat!</i>

35:32.697 --> 35:34.029
<i>Yes, he's gonna get the rat!</i>

35:34.031 --> 35:35.564
<i>Go in the back. Go in the back.</i>

35:35.566 --> 35:36.932
<i>I don't see no rat here.</i>

35:36.934 --> 35:39.168
<i>Calm down, Dean! We're getting it.</i>

35:41.506 --> 35:42.872
<i>Did you get the rat?!</i>

35:44.108 --> 35:45.040
<i>Oh! Got him!</i>

35:45.460 --> 35:46.575
<i>Did you get the rat?!</i>

35:46.577 --> 35:49.712
<i>Dead rat, big bro, dead rat.
Rat-free zone.</i>

35:49.714 --> 35:51.247
<i>Roller got the rat.</i>

35:51.249 --> 35:53.349
<i>Hey, you need an exterminator ASAP.</i>

35:53.351 --> 35:54.517
<i>Des, Roller got the rat.</i>

35:55.953 --> 35:57.481

<i>Yeah. Yeah, Roller got the rat.</i>

36:03.528 --> 36:06.662
<i>How you gonna do that
filing nails, baby?</i>

36:06.664 --> 36:08.130
<i>Hmm?</i>

36:14.492 --> 36:15.958
<i>Hey, D.</i>

36:16.774 --> 36:18.618
<i>You want in on the game?</i>

36:20.965 --> 36:23.164
<i>You could wash that money.</i>

37:01.208 --> 37:02.508
♪ I need money

37:02.543 --> 37:04.810
♪ That's what I want

37:04.845 --> 37:05.978
♪ That's what I want

37:06.013 --> 37:08.280
♪ That's what I want

37:08.316 --> 37:09.181
♪ That's what I wa-a-ant

37:09.884 --> 37:13.419
<i>I should have listened to you
about the clinic.</i>

37:14.716 --> 37:17.058
<i>I think I'm in over my head.</i>

37:17.060 --> 37:20.505
<i>They "retired" the last doctor.</i>

37:20.826 --> 37:24.928
<i>Roller's got a...
He's got a dark side, Pol.</i>

37:25.477 --> 37:27.331
<i>I don't know if I can trust him.</i>

37:27.333 --> 37:29.299
<i>You got to get away from these people.</i>

37:29.301 --> 37:32.035
<i>But I am so close to getting my bonus.</i>

37:32.037 --> 37:34.304
<i>Well, it's gonna be hard
to spend it if you're dead.</i>

37:39.545 --> 37:42.746
<i>Yeah, well, it'll be hard
to spend it if you're dead.</i>

37:42.748 --> 37:45.449
You don't have to give a shit
about me, Roller,

37:45.451 --> 37:48.952
but at least think about what
killing me will do to Dean.

37:48.954 --> 37:51.722
I know you care about him, too.

37:52.725 --> 37:55.659
At least let me say goodbye.

37:57.530 --> 37:59.530
Please.

38:05.271 --> 38:06.537
Hurry up.

38:11.444 --> 38:12.609
Hello?

38:12.611 --> 38:14.311
Hey, Deanie. What... Whatcha doing?

38:14.313 --> 38:16.747
Uh, I-I'm... I'm just talking to
you on the phone.

38:16.749 --> 38:18.682
I-I'm glad you called.

38:18.684 --> 38:20.584
A... A-As you're aware,

38:20.586 --> 38:22.419
I've been having lots of intercourse

38:22.421 --> 38:23.687
with my girlfriend, Virginia.

38:23.689 --> 38:26.156
Yeah. I'm aware, baby.

38:27.122 --> 38:30.194
Yes. Well, um, I love her,

38:30.196 --> 38:32.930
and when you love someone
you're having intercourse with

38:32.932 --> 38:34.965
who's also your girlfriend,
you should...

38:34.967 --> 38:36.400
you should marry them.

38:36.402 --> 38:38.769
Yeah, well, Deanie,
y-you... you don't...

38:38.771 --> 38:41.104
You don't always have to
get married, baby.

38:41.594 --> 38:44.107
Yeah, but, uh, r-remember
when I was little?

38:44.109 --> 38:46.076
At... at night y-you would rub my head

38:46.078 --> 38:49.847
and then you'd tell me your wish
was that I'd find someone

38:49.849 --> 38:53.183
that... that would love me
for who I am, like you do.

38:53.976 --> 38:56.753
Yeah. Yeah, I remember, baby.

38:57.957 --> 39:00.324
Yeah. Virginia loves me.

39:02.228 --> 39:03.950
Virginia loves me.

39:04.163 --> 39:07.798
S-She loves me, and...
and she helps me when...

39:07.800 --> 39:10.534
when I get upset,
and... and I help her, too,

39:10.536 --> 39:12.803
and... and she may have food issues

39:12.805 --> 39:15.472
that place her on the autistic spectrum,

39:15.474 --> 39:17.441
so we're an excellent match.

39:17.443 --> 39:19.910
A-Also... also, I love sex.

39:23.249 --> 39:24.781
Des?

39:24.783 --> 39:26.750
I'm... I'm here, baby.

39:26.752 --> 39:29.052
Oh, o... Um, Des, I-I would...

39:29.054 --> 39:31.355
I would like your blessing to propose.

39:31.357 --> 39:34.224
I-I-I-I know you think
she's a tiny skank-ho,

39:34.226 --> 39:37.461
but she's not,
and... and if we get married,

39:37.463 --> 39:40.130
you don't have to take
care of me anymore.

39:42.879 --> 39:45.235
You have my blessing, Deanie.

39:47.239 --> 39:49.640
Y-You sound... you sound...
You sound funny.

39:49.996 --> 39:51.842
Did... Are you okay?

39:51.844 --> 39:53.477
I'm... Baby, I'm fine.

39:53.479 --> 39:56.213
I'm... I'm just happy you found someone.

39:56.215 --> 39:59.149
I also want... want you to be
the one who marries us,

39:59.151 --> 40:01.251
so I... I sent you a link to a website

40:01.253 --> 40:03.954
where... where you can
become a minister for $50.

40:03.956 --> 40:06.223
They accept all major credit cards.

40:08.540 --> 40:11.295
Dean, I want you to to...
I want you to remember...

40:11.297 --> 40:14.665
always remember that I love you, okay?

40:15.568 --> 40:17.034
Is that a yes?

40:17.036 --> 40:19.536
- Y-Yes. Yes. Yes, Dean.
- That's a yes.

40:19.538 --> 40:22.773
Okay, I want you to...
I want you to look in my closet.

40:22.775 --> 40:24.975
There's a box in there, a shoe box,

40:24.977 --> 40:27.411
with some money in it,
and you take that,

40:27.413 --> 40:30.480
and you buy Virginia
a pretty ring, okay, baby?

40:30.482 --> 40:33.417
Okay. Okay, Des.

40:37.423 --> 40:39.756
I'm gonna buy her a ring.

41:02.132 --> 41:04.841
Don't worry about it, baby girl.

41:05.321 --> 41:07.544
I'm thinking I'll do it nice and quick.

41:08.157 --> 41:10.413
I'll even bury you,

41:10.827 --> 41:13.580
bring you some nice flowers
to your grave.

41:14.497 --> 41:16.086
Calla lilies, right?

41:16.088 --> 41:17.420
Roller, please.

41:17.422 --> 41:19.856
Okay, you... we... We don't have to go.

41:19.858 --> 41:21.992
W-We can... We can leave together, baby.

41:21.994 --> 41:24.027
We can... We can start our own hustle.

41:24.029 --> 41:27.831
Laundromats, car washes...
You could be the king again.

41:28.511 --> 41:30.567
Please.

41:30.569 --> 41:32.369
I got a better idea.

41:32.371 --> 41:36.139
How 'bout I cut you,
hit you upside your head?

41:36.686 --> 41:37.774
Huh?

41:37.776 --> 41:40.133
Shoot you, choke your ass,

41:40.720 --> 41:44.080
burn you alive... unsuccessfully.

41:47.219 --> 41:51.688
You know what it's like to be
burned alive in a body bag, D?

41:51.690 --> 41:53.023
Hmm?

41:58.497 --> 42:00.463
It's tight.

42:01.669 --> 42:04.601
You can't see, you can't feel anything.

42:05.590 --> 42:08.914
Your heart feels
like it's in a headlock.

42:08.916 --> 42:10.345
It's hot.

42:11.084 --> 42:12.884
It's real goddamn hot.

42:12.886 --> 42:14.152
I'm sorry.

42:14.154 --> 42:15.654
Roller, I am.

42:15.656 --> 42:18.857
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

42:18.859 --> 42:20.292
I just...

42:20.294 --> 42:26.031
I get so tired of being treated
like shit, and I snapped.

42:27.734 --> 42:29.530
I fought for you.

42:30.698 --> 42:31.903
You lie.

42:33.201 --> 42:34.439
I did.

42:35.943 --> 42:37.842
I did.

42:41.915 --> 42:44.015
Hey, I want to talk to you
about Desna's bonus.

42:44.962 --> 42:47.285
That bitch was already here.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.989
She come crying to you about
better dog food, too, huh?

42:51.469 --> 42:52.824
I'm gonna tell you something, son.

42:53.221 --> 42:56.027
You just got to just
cut that shit right off.

42:56.683 --> 42:59.297
Go back to table scraps,
you know what I'm saying?

42:59.299 --> 43:00.632
It's called training.

43:01.354 --> 43:02.934
Yeah. You owe her that money.

43:04.972 --> 43:07.739
You forget who you're talking to, boy?

43:07.741 --> 43:09.107
Uncle Daddy, she's...

43:09.109 --> 43:10.475
I don't owe nobody shit.

43:12.879 --> 43:14.980
Uncle Daddy, she's been
killing it at the clinic.

43:14.982 --> 43:17.082
She's an essential part
of the operation.

43:18.585 --> 43:20.218
I promised her that 20 grand.

43:23.824 --> 43:25.323
You promised her, huh?

43:25.325 --> 43:26.879
Yep.

43:28.353 --> 43:29.294
Let me tell you something, baby boy.

43:29.296 --> 43:30.428
What?

43:30.430 --> 43:35.634
You don't promise anybody my money!

43:35.636 --> 43:36.868
You understand me?

43:36.870 --> 43:38.036
Yeah.

43:38.038 --> 43:39.504
This is my operation.

43:39.506 --> 43:41.339
I call the shots.

43:42.061 --> 43:43.742
You hear me, baby boy?!

43:54.454 --> 43:56.054
H-How did it go?

44:05.532 --> 44:08.500
Uh, Polly? C...

44:10.630 --> 44:12.437
I'll be right back.

44:12.439 --> 44:13.838
C-C-Could... Could you...

44:13.840 --> 44:15.874
Could you put all your bridal
magazines in here?

44:15.876 --> 44:18.209
I-I-I'm gonna propose to Virginia.

44:18.723 --> 44:21.112
Uh, sure, sugar.

44:21.114 --> 44:23.148
Does Desna know about this, through?

44:23.150 --> 44:25.950
Yeah. I-I-I just talked her
on the phone.

44:25.952 --> 44:28.720
S-She sounded strange,
but she gave her blessing.

44:29.108 --> 44:31.189
She said you could marry Virginia?

44:31.694 --> 44:33.658
Yeah.

44:34.614 --> 44:35.660
Okay, why don't you go sit over there,

44:35.662 --> 44:37.362
and I'll get 'em for ya, okay?

44:37.364 --> 44:39.631
Okay. Thanks, Polly.

44:41.802 --> 44:44.669
Could you excuse me for
just a second? Come here.

44:44.671 --> 44:46.671
What are you doing?

44:48.542 --> 44:49.908
Okay, I'm gonna ask you again.

44:49.910 --> 44:52.277
Tell me exactly
what Desna said on the phone.

44:52.279 --> 44:53.611
Girl, we still on this?

44:53.613 --> 44:55.380
Answer the question, pretty baby.

44:55.382 --> 44:56.581
Okay.

44:56.583 --> 44:59.350
Um, Roller accepted everything,

44:59.352 --> 45:01.753
uh, she's gonna go out
with Dr. Gregory Ruval.

45:01.755 --> 45:02.954
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh!

45:02.956 --> 45:04.289
She's gonna fall on his cock.

45:04.291 --> 45:06.758
Um... uh, they're gonna
go eat lamb chops

45:06.760 --> 45:09.094
and have some kind of weird
euphoria salad.

45:09.096 --> 45:09.894
Okay?

45:09.896 --> 45:11.429
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:12.527 --> 45:14.299
<i>Desna said "Cock"?</i>

45:14.301 --> 45:15.767
<i>I know.</i>

45:15.769 --> 45:18.069
<i>S-She sounded strange,
but she gave her blessing.</i>

45:18.071 --> 45:20.051
<i>She said you could marry Virginia?</i>

45:20.741 --> 45:24.909
<i>If you have any problems
in here at all, call me.</i>

45:24.911 --> 45:27.278
Call me and say "Ambrosia salad."

45:27.280 --> 45:29.481
Some kind of weird euphoria salad.

45:35.088 --> 45:36.721
Come on.

45:38.492 --> 45:40.258
Slow down.

45:45.226 --> 45:47.232
Hold it. Right here.

45:49.569 --> 45:50.869
Roller, please.

45:50.871 --> 45:52.871
Okay, listen...
Let's turn the car around

45:52.873 --> 45:54.272
before you get yourself killed.

45:54.274 --> 45:56.307
This shit ain't worth dying over!

45:57.744 --> 46:00.645
I already died twice, baby.
I got to handle it.

46:01.882 --> 46:03.815
Come on. Get up.

46:28.542 --> 46:29.774
Shit!

46:29.776 --> 46:31.042
Oh, my God!

46:48.628 --> 46:50.628
Roller, please! Let's talk about this!

46:50.630 --> 46:52.997
You're losing your shit right now!

46:52.999 --> 46:54.999
We're done talking. We're done talking.

46:55.001 --> 46:57.035
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

46:57.037 --> 46:58.469
Wait, Roller, I'm sorry.

46:58.471 --> 47:00.071
I'm sorry. I know...

47:00.974 --> 47:02.307
I know I messed up, and...

47:02.309 --> 47:04.342
and if I could do it all over again,

47:04.344 --> 47:05.743
I would, I swear.

47:05.745 --> 47:06.724
Yeah?

47:07.414 --> 47:09.447
I love you, Roller.

47:10.732 --> 47:12.016
No.

47:13.064 --> 47:14.919
You lying piece of shit.

47:14.921 --> 47:16.321
It's the doctor you respect.

47:16.323 --> 47:18.089
You think I don't know that?

47:21.342 --> 47:22.794
You don't love me.

47:22.796 --> 47:24.729
You just love that money.

47:24.731 --> 47:26.364
No. It's not true!

47:26.366 --> 47:30.802
Me and you... We was so good
together, Roller.

47:32.072 --> 47:35.173
Ride or die... me and you!

47:35.175 --> 47:36.774
You know it!

47:38.178 --> 47:40.912
You can't do it. ...do it.

47:40.914 --> 47:43.748
You can't do it 'cause you love me, too!

47:43.750 --> 47:46.184
You love me, Roller!

47:56.963 --> 47:58.796
Roller, look out!
