[theme song plays]

00:23.231 --> 00:25.191
[tense music plays]

00:33.158 --> 00:34.367
[breathing heavily]

00:35.952 --> 00:36.786
[screeching]

00:42.375 --> 00:44.252
[Clay] Lately,
it's like I'm watching myself

00:44.335 --> 00:45.712
in the movie of my life.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.174
It's like I'm removed from reality.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.138
[voices echoing]

00:57.140 --> 00:59.934
It's gonna be fucking freezing tonight.
[Bryce screams]

01:00.101 --> 01:02.812
-Please, I don't want to die out here.
-[horn honking]

01:03.855 --> 01:04.773
[gasps]

01:07.233 --> 01:09.611
[Clay] And then
reality comes crashing back in.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.029
[door opens]

01:14.074 --> 01:16.117
-I was just out for a run.
-[door closes]

01:18.119 --> 01:20.413
I found him out on Navy Pier this time.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.248
Just standing there.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.459
I lost track of time. That's all. I...

01:25.877 --> 01:29.047
-How did you even find me?
-Clay, last week you go out running,

01:29.130 --> 01:31.966
and you wind up
in front of Bryce's old house,

01:32.050 --> 01:33.927
now you're at the place
where he got killed?

01:34.010 --> 01:37.388
I didn't mean to go there.
[stammers] I just... I kept running,

01:37.472 --> 01:41.684
and I didn't hear my phone
'cause I was... thinking.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.521
[Mrs. Jensen sighs]

01:44.604 --> 01:45.647
Well, um...

01:47.398 --> 01:51.486
we told you that we were going to be doing
random drug testing on you both

01:51.569 --> 01:53.530
while Justin was still in the program,

01:53.947 --> 01:54.948
and...

01:55.949 --> 01:58.034
now seems like as good a time as any.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.911
Like, right now?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.122
Yes, right now.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.748
Is that a problem?

02:05.041 --> 02:05.959
No.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.961
No, it's not a problem.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.046
Jesus, you're overreacting.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.841
[Mr. Jensen] We just want to make sure
you're being safe.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.634
We want to know we can trust you.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.470
If you trusted us,
you wouldn't be testing us.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.723
OK, Clay, that's enough. You're up first.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.695
[Clay] But lately,
even reality isn't making sense.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.780
I mean, the test must be...

02:36.698 --> 02:37.991
expired or something.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.325
No.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.202
The tests are fine.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.375
-Then he must have switched the samples.
-Are you serious right now?

02:48.126 --> 02:49.878
How would I have switched them?

02:49.961 --> 02:52.172
I don't know.
I'm sure it's something you would know.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.548
What does that even mean?

02:55.633 --> 02:58.428
Guys, I have been going
to all my meetings.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.763
I have been checking in
with the counselors.

03:02.932 --> 03:03.975
I'm doing good.

03:06.227 --> 03:10.148
Justin... did you go back
to your old neighborhood last week?

03:12.066 --> 03:13.026
How did...

03:15.862 --> 03:16.821
Yeah, I might have.

03:17.238 --> 03:20.283
-What were you doing there?
-I wasn't buying drugs.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.201
OK.

03:21.868 --> 03:22.994
So why were you there?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.540
[Mrs. Jensen] OK.

03:27.957 --> 03:32.378
If that's how it's going to be,
then both of you are grounded.

03:32.879 --> 03:36.466
Until one of you can tell us
why this test is positive,

03:36.549 --> 03:40.678
neither of you are leaving this house
apart from going to school. Understand?

03:41.512 --> 03:43.431
[sighs] All right, get some rest.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.020
[door opens, closes]

03:50.355 --> 03:51.940
You're fucking using again?

03:52.023 --> 03:54.067
Fuck you. You know I'm clean.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.736
Then why were you
in your old neighborhood?

03:56.819 --> 03:59.405
You tell me,
'cause clearly, you followed me

03:59.489 --> 04:01.866
and then ran straight home to rat me out.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.201
I didn't follow you.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.954
Then how the fuck did they know
I was there? Hm?

04:06.579 --> 04:09.958
They were asleep when I left,
and they were asleep when I came home.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.796
How did my dad know I was at the pier?

04:14.879 --> 04:17.090
He just happens to see me
from the overpass?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.092
He just happens to find me last week?

04:19.175 --> 04:21.427
He couldn't have followed you because...

04:22.804 --> 04:24.264
'cause he left way after you.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.020
What if it's our phones?

04:31.854 --> 04:32.855
[Justin] What?

04:33.856 --> 04:37.902
They gave us these phones for Christmas
with a bunch of apps already loaded.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.656
What if one of those apps is, like,
tracking us?

04:42.782 --> 04:45.368
All right, Clay, you're being so paranoid.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.204
Your dad found you
because you've been doing crazy shit,

04:48.288 --> 04:51.124
like showing up at the fucking pier
or Bryce's house!

04:51.207 --> 04:54.043
-What the hell?
-Why were you in your old neighborhood?

04:54.711 --> 04:56.754
What the hell have you been up to, Justin?

04:59.257 --> 05:00.675
Yeah, that's what I thought.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.344
Why'd you test positive?

05:03.803 --> 05:04.846
Fuck you.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.560
[door slams]

05:14.063 --> 05:17.984
[Clay] And I'm just sitting watching
the whole thing from somewhere else.

05:20.069 --> 05:20.987
Hey.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.198
Yeah, it's, uh... it's Foley.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.286
[voice trembles] I need to see you.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.462
Hey, baby girl.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.213
Sorry I missed dinner.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.923
That's all right. I was out.

05:41.924 --> 05:42.967
With Diego?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.345
Um...

05:45.678 --> 05:46.846
[chuckles] Yeah.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.223
My, you two have been spending
quite a bit of time together.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.059
Should we have him over for dinner?

05:51.392 --> 05:55.396
You know, he doesn't really do so well
talking with adults, or most people.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.482
Football player, right?

05:57.648 --> 05:59.275
Yeah, sounds like a charmer.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.112
Guess he's texting you
night and day, though.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.906
[suspenseful music plays]

06:05.406 --> 06:08.618
-Not really, no.
-Yeah, well, I'd love to have him over.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.829
Hey, what about, uh, Saturday night?

06:12.330 --> 06:14.624
I mean,
I'd rather have you home than at that...

06:15.124 --> 06:17.377
What's it called?
The Find Your Drink party?

06:19.670 --> 06:22.673
-How do you know there's a party?
-Air Force intelligence.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.592
Sleep well, my love.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.221
You're in logistics.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.515
[under breath] Fuck.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.396
-[Justin] Hey, Coach.
-[Kerba] How you doing, kid?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.149
Uh...

06:41.526 --> 06:42.443
Not so good.

06:42.860 --> 06:43.778
I, uh...

06:46.030 --> 06:47.323
Yeah, not so good.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.492
-Did you take a fall?
-No.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.329
No, I'm still clean. I...

06:57.291 --> 06:58.709
Uh, actually, the...

07:00.211 --> 07:03.464
The Jensens drug tested us,

07:04.757 --> 07:08.136
and I was clean, and...

07:09.512 --> 07:10.680
Clay wasn't,

07:12.223 --> 07:16.602
and then he accused me
of switching the tests.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.729
[Kerba sighs]

07:20.815 --> 07:22.608
I don't know. I think they might...

07:23.568 --> 07:25.403
they might have believed him.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.782
You think, or you know?

07:30.366 --> 07:31.367
I don't know.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.162
Just feels like...

07:37.081 --> 07:38.791
like no one believes in me.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.295
[taps table] Like no one trusts me.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.630
The Jensens tested you.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.925
That doesn't mean
they don't trust you, right?

07:48.009 --> 07:51.220
Probably means
they want you to be successful.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.931
-[sighs]
-You working the steps?

07:55.141 --> 07:56.017
OK.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.685
You're making amends?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.395
Trying to.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.356
[voice catches]
I don't really feel like I can.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.652
You know, I've got all this...

08:08.029 --> 08:10.281
I've got all this on me, and I...

08:12.825 --> 08:16.496
-I never know how to get out from under.
-OK. Sure. Right.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.248
Let's talk it out. OK?

08:21.626 --> 08:23.085
-Yeah.
-OK.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.837
Yeah.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.089
[sniffles] Yeah, OK.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.134
[Clay] Not only am I not in control,

08:31.969 --> 08:33.179
I'm not even there.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.181
Hey, Tony.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.683
Man, what the hell happened to you?

08:38.184 --> 08:40.186
I haven't slept so much lately. I...

08:41.354 --> 08:44.065
I think things are wrong.
I think shit's happening.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.983
Yeah, that's, like, for years now.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.401
You mean something new?

08:48.402 --> 08:50.112
I'm trying to figure that out.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.906
-I don't understand.
-[Tyler] Hey.

08:52.782 --> 08:53.824
-Hey, Tyler.
-Hey.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.661
Um, so you have your first fight
this weekend, right?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.454
-Um...
-You're fighting?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.039
Yes, to both questions.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.542
It's my first league match
since I got my certification.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.546
Well, if you still need a cutman, like,
in your corner, I'd really like to do it.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.926
Yeah. OK. Uh...
Can you train after school?

09:12.718 --> 09:13.636
Yeah. For sure.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.972
Yeah. OK, great. I'll see you then.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.934
He hasn't spoken to me in two weeks

09:20.017 --> 09:23.563
since I pissed him off
at the camping trip, so why now?

09:24.647 --> 09:25.731
Why are you fighting?

09:28.401 --> 09:29.735
What else am I gonna do?

09:32.029 --> 09:32.905
Yeah.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.740
Guess I hear that.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.450
[suspenseful music plays]

09:41.330 --> 09:44.959
[Clay] It's hard to know what's real
and what's, like, paranoia.

09:50.548 --> 09:54.051
So, um...
you've never met my dad, have you?

09:54.135 --> 09:55.886
Or talked to him?

09:55.970 --> 09:58.014
Oh, shit, why? Is he after me?

09:58.097 --> 10:01.934
No, uh...
he just seems to know who you are.

10:02.351 --> 10:05.896
Everyone knows who I am.
I'm prominent and noteworthy.

10:05.980 --> 10:10.484
Oh, wow! That's so cute, your vocabulary.

10:10.818 --> 10:11.819
[Luke sighs]

10:12.236 --> 10:13.487
Fucking party's off.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.033
-What? Why?
-Beecher's parents found out.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.035
So we find another house.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.037
How did Beecher's parents find out?

10:21.787 --> 10:23.664
[Luke] Read his email or some shit.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.419
Whose parents are loaded
and out of town right now?

10:29.253 --> 10:30.296
[Luke] I don't know.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.131
Such bullshit.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.511
Did you hear?
Find Your Drink got canceled.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.599
I did not hear
but wasn't really listening.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.434
I wasn't planning on going to that.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.729
What is a Find Your Drink party anyway?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.273
You find your drink
before you head off to college.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.778
You know, like tequila, vodka, whiskey.

10:53.861 --> 10:57.073
You try them all,
find which one is your drink, so you know.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.159
Can't you just know?

11:00.576 --> 11:03.412
It... Yeah, I don't know.
I don't endorse the traditions.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.082
I'm just simply reporting the details
as I get them.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.625
Yes. And it's appreciated.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.210
Thank you.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.088
-[bell rings]
-[Clay] So I try to focus,

11:13.089 --> 11:14.632
try to catch up to the plot.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.885
My dad knew
how much Diego and I have been texting,

11:17.968 --> 11:19.720
and he knew what was on the texts.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.473
He probably tracks your GPS too.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.393
[Alex] But this is crazy, right?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.646
I mean, I bet it's not a coincidence.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.527
But it's not just us.
It's why Beecher canceled his party.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.738
We have more to lose than Beecher does.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.991
Isn't your dad on you all the time?

11:41.867 --> 11:45.538
Yeah, he's been watching me closely,
but he doesn't track my phone.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.373
[Jess] That you know of.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.251
He trusts me.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.169
Yes, I get the irony.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.798
Tony, I mean...

11:57.591 --> 11:59.009
This isn't crazy, right?

11:59.802 --> 12:02.513
Your folks don't seem like the type
to track you.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.391
How else have they known everything?

12:07.184 --> 12:08.519
[Jess] Where's Justin?

12:09.311 --> 12:10.646
Why isn't he here?

12:13.858 --> 12:15.526
[ominous music plays]

12:34.420 --> 12:35.254
[sighs]

12:36.088 --> 12:37.089
[Justin] Hey.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.760
Justin. Do you remember
when you and me went to see Monty?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.930
We... we never went to see Monty.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.067
Justin?

12:58.527 --> 13:01.405
Wait. What time is it? What...
Where have you been?

13:02.031 --> 13:02.948
Uh...

13:04.283 --> 13:05.618
It's midnight.

13:07.536 --> 13:08.412
Nowhere.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.664
They'll find out.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.708
Your parents?

13:13.292 --> 13:14.126
[Clay] Them.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.920
Everyone.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.756
The party's off
because they're watching us.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.591
We gotta figure that out.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.134
We need to get sleep.

13:22.968 --> 13:23.928
OK?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.395
All right, we can do it, no problem.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.566
But seriously, Clay, you're doing this
so the jocks can have a party?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.026
[Clay] We can all go to the party.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.070
And if we can message everyone
a new location

13:41.153 --> 13:42.488
without any adults finding out,

13:42.571 --> 13:45.825
then I know that my secret shit
can stay secret from here on out.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.913
All right. We're on it.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.958
We'll have to get a GPS spoofer
on everyone's phone.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.085
And set up a VPN
so people can download it

13:56.168 --> 13:59.088
-without the school knowing.
-And we'll need everyone who uses email

13:59.171 --> 14:01.549
to have a translator and a cipher
from the dark web.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.509
-Yup.
-[boy] Who uses email?

14:03.592 --> 14:06.053
People do, dickhead, OK?
I've seen the stats.

14:06.136 --> 14:06.971
Sure.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.056
Amazing. I mean,

14:10.182 --> 14:12.810
how can you guys be punks
and geeks at the same time?

14:12.893 --> 14:14.645
There aren't genres anymore, Clay.

14:14.728 --> 14:15.563
No labels,

14:16.021 --> 14:17.064
just people.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.859
I mean, you just called the jocks "jocks."

14:20.276 --> 14:23.070
It's how they self-identify.
I'm just being respectful.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.239
-Preach.
-[punks high-five]

14:28.158 --> 14:31.120
[Clay] Of course I keep secrets.
Everybody does.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.455
It's called survival.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.334
So, I hear the party's back on.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.627
Um... hi.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.212
We're working.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.172
So sorry to bother you.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.800
I just wanted
to introduce myself to Estela.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.968
I'm Winston.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.345
-Hi.
-I knew your brother a little bit.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.015
We met at a couple of Hillcrest parties
last year.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.099
[Estela] Oh.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.810
-Cool, you friends with Jess?
-No.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.897
Well, I'm new,
but, uh, I'm a huge fan.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.900
I think it's great
how committed Jessica is

15:00.983 --> 15:04.153
to getting justice for people
who've been wronged by the system.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.529
-Mm.
-It's really inspiring.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.739
Totally, right?

15:07.865 --> 15:10.701
Anyway, uh, I talked to Diego and the guys

15:10.784 --> 15:14.663
about doing a little memorial thing
for Monty tomorrow at the party.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.791
-Thought you might wanna be there for it.
-That sounds really cool.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.919
We'll think about it. Thanks.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.922
So I'll see you tomorrow, I hope.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.090
[suspenseful music plays]

15:29.845 --> 15:31.013
He seems nice.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.640
He's not.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.809
Could be cool to go to the party.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.648
[Clay] The trick is keeping track
of which secrets are which,

15:40.731 --> 15:42.274
and what lies go with them...

15:43.651 --> 15:45.569
and who helped you with which lie.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.529
Hey!

15:47.613 --> 15:51.659
So, we need more Zach and Alex time.
How about I stay over tomorrow night?

15:52.076 --> 15:54.828
I'm not gonna kiss you again
if that's what you're hoping.

15:54.912 --> 15:58.332
Ha! I like that we can joke about this.
It's a good sign.

15:58.874 --> 16:02.086
-Progress. But seriously, tomorrow night?
-Uh... yeah, I guess.

16:02.169 --> 16:05.130
Perfect, yes, 'cause the real is
we're going to the Find Your Drink party

16:05.214 --> 16:07.591
to find many, many drinks.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.134
My mom set up cameras in my room,

16:09.218 --> 16:11.261
so I need a cover story
and a place to sleep it off.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.014
OK, you can have the cover story
and the guest room,

16:14.098 --> 16:17.726
but I'm gonna pass on the party
because I'm anti-people currently.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.561
And I get that,

16:19.645 --> 16:23.148
but maybe that's why you should go.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.442
Wait.
Your mom put up cameras in your room?

16:26.235 --> 16:28.821
That's only part of it,
but don't even get me started.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.906
Anyways, I'm picking you up at 8:00,

16:31.407 --> 16:33.993
and if you make any attempt
not to go to this party,

16:34.076 --> 16:38.288
I will actually come
and pick you up at 8:00.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.628
It's hot, right? I'll actually come and,
like, physically pick you up.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.506
-Come on! We can have hot banter, right?
-How am I even friends with you?

16:47.589 --> 16:51.510
I'm handsome, charming,
and, mm... I saved you from drowning.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.512
Eight o'clock!

16:56.432 --> 16:59.059
[Clay] Then there's the secrets
you know nothing about,

17:00.185 --> 17:01.854
that you're not even a part of...

17:02.813 --> 17:05.816
that are eventually going to show up
and bite you in the ass.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.070
[glass smashes]

17:14.116 --> 17:15.284
[coach] Right along here.

17:15.367 --> 17:19.079
OK, judge's chair is here.
Your barrier line is right here.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.165
Two rows of chairs all the way around.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.374
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.335
So, the latest we hear is
the party's called off.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.213
My daughter heard the same at East County.

17:28.630 --> 17:32.342
-I'm thinking of pulling the checkpoints.
-No. I heard chatter later in the day.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.136
They're looking for another venue.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.389
I got the Padilla kid fighting here
tonight. He might know something.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.891
Yeah?

17:38.974 --> 17:40.350
Is he opening up to you?

17:40.434 --> 17:42.352
Not yet, but he will.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.149
Maybe I'll come by tonight.

17:47.524 --> 17:48.442
[coach] Great.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.530
[Clay] And then what do you do about
the person who shares your secrets,

17:54.239 --> 17:56.075
but no longer shares your life?

18:05.501 --> 18:07.044
Welcome to Monet's.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.254
Can I direct you to the nearest Starbucks?

18:09.838 --> 18:11.507
Wait, you're being a dick to me?

18:11.590 --> 18:13.258
That is the situation, yeah.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.260
-Oh.
-But it shouldn't bother you

18:15.344 --> 18:17.763
because you only trust yourself, right?

18:18.680 --> 18:21.975
You're a strong, independent woman
who doesn't need a guy to...

18:23.393 --> 18:24.269
Wait. [chuckles]

18:25.521 --> 18:26.688
Who is that? That...

18:26.772 --> 18:28.190
Is that Diego?

18:28.273 --> 18:29.691
Fuck you!

18:29.775 --> 18:31.527
-You know what that's about.
-Yeah.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.653
I do.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.822
Do you? [scoffs]

18:35.114 --> 18:37.825
Can I just get a vanilla skim latte
and a black coffee?

18:42.329 --> 18:43.288
You coming tonight?

18:43.997 --> 18:46.333
If I am, it'd be in my bedroom.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.043
Alone.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.174
He'll ring you up at the register.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.763
[Clay] I've got enough secrets.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.724
I have a hard enough time
with the secrets I already have.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.770
So, you don't know how the test
could have been positive?

19:06.854 --> 19:10.023
I literally have never tried pot
in my life.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.316
I'm scared of drugs.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.235
Benadryl is a bad trip for me.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.531
You know, Clay, I can't tell your parents
what we talk about here.

19:17.948 --> 19:21.702
And by law, unless you're in danger
of harming yourself or others,

19:21.785 --> 19:24.663
-I can't tell the police.
-So you don't believe me either.

19:24.746 --> 19:25.831
I'm not saying that.

19:25.914 --> 19:29.001
I just want to make sure
you understand the ground rules.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.294
I've done some bad shit.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.421
I haven't done pot.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.840
D'you wanna talk about the bad stuff?

19:41.305 --> 19:42.306
[clears throat]

19:44.349 --> 19:48.770
I look at you, Clay,
and I see a kid who's paying a price.

19:49.771 --> 19:53.650
A very high price,
and I don't yet know what for.

19:53.734 --> 19:57.738
So I suspect it might be
for some of the secrets you keep.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.074
Look, some of it...

20:02.451 --> 20:03.911
is just high school stuff.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.413
-Come on!
-Yo!

20:06.496 --> 20:07.539
You rule!

20:07.998 --> 20:09.958
[Clay] Like, kids should have parties,

20:10.042 --> 20:15.088
parents should look the other way
by technological deception if necessary.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.174
St. George!

20:17.257 --> 20:18.550
Luke, what's up, man?

20:18.634 --> 20:20.093
I am already mostly drunk.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.679
Oh, preparation, man!
I learned that from you.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.640
-You're not drunk enough.
-[chuckles]

20:24.723 --> 20:26.767
Are we gonna get you laid tonight?

20:26.850 --> 20:30.437
I'm gonna bet no,
but I appreciate you thinking of me, Luke.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.272
Always, man. Always.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.066
Let's go, boy.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.777
-[dance music plays]
-[jocks chatter excitedly]

20:36.860 --> 20:39.279
OK, the game is called Paranoia.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.324
The first guy up whispers a question
to the next guy.

20:42.407 --> 20:46.161
A who question: Who did this or that?
Who's the worst ho?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.498
-Who lies about the size of their dick?
-[all giggle]

20:50.123 --> 20:51.500
So it starts like this. Go.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.838
-[whispering]
-[snickers]

20:58.131 --> 20:59.007
Jessica.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.384
For sure, Jessica.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.678
What? What about me?

21:03.553 --> 21:06.556
Exactly.
Now, if you want to find out what he said,

21:06.640 --> 21:07.975
you have to take a shot.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.187
[Jess] All right.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.025
OK.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.277
So?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.528
The question was,

21:20.362 --> 21:23.365
which girl at this table
is most likely to beat me up?

21:23.448 --> 21:25.075
[chuckling]

21:25.993 --> 21:28.537
-Jess, now you go.
-OK.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.750
[whispering]

21:36.086 --> 21:37.087
I'm gonna say Walton.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.673
-[snickering]
-His name is Winston.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.636
What was the question?

21:45.762 --> 21:47.681
Who's not as smart as he thinks he is?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.808
-Ooh!
-Ouch.

21:50.225 --> 21:52.686
[Diego] If you can prove that,
Jess has got to drink.

21:54.813 --> 21:58.859
I think people assume
you must have been happy when Bryce died,

21:59.651 --> 22:02.237
but I bet your life would be
a lot less complicated

22:02.321 --> 22:03.655
if he were still alive.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.241
Dude, what the fuck?

22:06.575 --> 22:07.701
[tense music plays]

22:07.784 --> 22:08.785
[Jess chuckles]

22:09.453 --> 22:10.829
Well, I guess I drink.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.585
[Clay] Yeah, I mean, I have secrets,

22:19.254 --> 22:21.757
but not drugs. I've never done drugs.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.968
Shit! Nice lungs, dude. [chuckles]

22:25.052 --> 22:27.262
That's a fucking rock star rip, man.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.514
No, that's a hip-hop rip.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.099
-Oh, my God.
-[chuckles]

22:32.100 --> 22:33.727
[exhales slowly]

22:35.604 --> 22:37.522
Are you fucking kidding me?

22:42.694 --> 22:45.322
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Looking out for you.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.158
-What are you doing?
-Well, thanks to you,

22:48.241 --> 22:49.910
my parents think I smoke, so why not?

22:49.993 --> 22:53.413
Look, Clay, I know I'm the last guy
to tell you not to do drugs,

22:54.206 --> 22:56.083
but what the fuck are you trying to prove?

22:56.166 --> 22:57.250
It's just weed.

22:57.876 --> 23:01.088
It's not like I'm shooting heroin
in a fucking alley in Oakland.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.927
I don't know what I did to piss you off,

23:07.469 --> 23:10.931
but, Clay, I am not the enemy.

23:13.141 --> 23:14.059
Yeah, whatever.

23:14.142 --> 23:17.187
-Yeah, whatever is a piece-of-shit word.
-Get the fuck off me.

23:17.270 --> 23:20.107
You lied to Matt and Lainie
about the drugs.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.235
They think I relapsed.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.947
You have any idea
how long it took them to trust me?

23:27.030 --> 23:29.324
Sorry, who the fuck are Matt and Lainie?

23:29.783 --> 23:30.784
Your mom and dad.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.077
Yeah, my mom and dad.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.080
They're not your fucking parents,
so stop pretending they are.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.875
They know what you are.
You're not fooling anyone, Justin.

23:41.294 --> 23:42.421
-Dude.
-Yeah.

23:43.046 --> 23:45.590
They never trusted you,
that's why they drug tested you.

23:51.972 --> 23:52.973
Hey, Clay.

23:53.807 --> 23:54.850
Coming out back?

23:55.642 --> 23:56.768
No. Why?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.938
We're gonna pour one out for Monty,
thought you might want to be there.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.315
Why would I?

24:03.108 --> 24:04.151
[Winston] Well...

24:04.651 --> 24:06.987
I hear you're the guy
who made the party possible,

24:07.070 --> 24:09.990
you know,
free from the eyes of parents and cops.

24:10.073 --> 24:13.452
That's... a nice trick,
fooling all those people.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.536
It wasn't me.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.955
-It was some friends of mine.
-Mm-hmm.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.291
Always is, isn't it?

24:21.710 --> 24:23.420
[tense music plays]

24:25.005 --> 24:26.590
[Diego] Everybody, listen up!

24:27.215 --> 24:29.050
Yo, turn that fucking music down!

-That's amazing. Congrats.
-Thank you!

38:45.489 --> 38:47.616
I've had to work my ass off to get here,

38:47.700 --> 38:50.369
but... things are finally

38:50.786 --> 38:51.996
actually really good.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.791
I would have told you earlier, but...

38:57.710 --> 38:59.045
-[chuckles]
-Right.

38:59.128 --> 39:02.131
Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't return your call,
I've just been...

39:02.840 --> 39:04.383
[sighs] ...busy, I guess.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.427
No, it's OK. I get it.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.305
Anyway, I just...

39:11.349 --> 39:14.935
I wanted to say thank you
for helping me get to where I am.

39:16.062 --> 39:20.274
I mean, you were there for me
last summer when I needed you, and...

39:27.823 --> 39:29.200
[stutters] Zach...

39:30.451 --> 39:32.495
I have... a boyfriend.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.289
I should've told you.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.916
No, I shouldn't...

39:37.792 --> 39:41.587
[sighs] I shouldn't have kissed you.
No, I'm sorry, that was really stupid.

39:41.670 --> 39:43.464
No, it's OK.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.091
He's a really great guy.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.801
-You'd like him.
-[sighs]

39:46.884 --> 39:49.387
He's outside if you want to meet him.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.847
No. I'm, uh... [exhales shakily]

39:51.931 --> 39:54.725
That's OK.
Yeah, I'm really happy for you though.

39:55.935 --> 39:56.936
Thanks.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.065
-I should go.
-Yeah.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.401
Definitely.
Yeah, it was really good seeing you.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.530
[footsteps recede, stop]

40:08.864 --> 40:11.992
Do you want to meet up
at the steps this week,

40:12.076 --> 40:14.120
like, after school sometime?

40:14.203 --> 40:15.788
No. I'm, uh... I'm...

40:17.164 --> 40:19.208
just probably gonna be
really busy, so...

40:19.625 --> 40:20.501
OK.

40:21.585 --> 40:22.878
I'll see you soon.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.422
-I hope.
-Yeah.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.178
[Clay] Secret heartbreak.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.599
Why didn't you tell me you had
so much power in your uppercut?

40:35.683 --> 40:37.309
Hey! Thanks for the assist.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.353
I guess you know our boy
a little better than I do.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.438
I don't know, maybe.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.148
So, what, he's your real trainer?

40:42.231 --> 40:44.108
-Yeah, he's my trainer.
-[chuckles]

40:45.067 --> 40:46.610
Hey, Tony, congratulations.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.781
-The whole department's real proud of you.
-Thank you.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.992
[Diaz] Swing by my office this week.

40:53.075 --> 40:56.287
We can chat about what's next for you.
You know, after high school.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.957
Uh... Yeah, I don't know,
I'm kind of busy.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.750
Maybe the week after then?

41:03.711 --> 41:06.255
-I'm headed into town. Anyone need a ride?
-I do.

41:07.047 --> 41:09.717
No, I got you.
I picked you up, I can drop you off.

41:10.634 --> 41:11.802
OK. Yeah.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.263
Just wait here. I'll shower real quick,
then we'll head out.

41:14.346 --> 41:16.932
-OK.
-Thanks anyway, Sheriff.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.059
Good job.

41:25.274 --> 41:27.651
[Clay] Sometimes,
all we have is our secrets.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.280
Aren't you grounded?

41:34.783 --> 41:36.327
Uh, folks are out.

41:36.702 --> 41:37.661
[sniffs]

41:38.704 --> 41:40.164
Left our phones at home.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.084
-I came looking for Clay.
-Hm.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.462
How'd that go?

41:47.129 --> 41:48.464
He hates me. [chuckles]

41:50.299 --> 41:51.634
And I don't know why.

41:52.843 --> 41:53.928
You hate me.

41:55.971 --> 41:57.181
And I do know why.

41:58.807 --> 42:00.309
-I don't hate you.
-[scoffs]

42:01.519 --> 42:03.187
I could never hate you.

42:05.731 --> 42:06.732
[Justin sighs]

42:07.816 --> 42:09.068
Are you smoking weed?

42:09.527 --> 42:10.444
No.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.323
The other guys were. [sniffs]

42:14.990 --> 42:16.116
But you're drinking.

42:17.117 --> 42:18.494
Yeah. I am.

42:19.161 --> 42:20.704
[sniffs] And?

42:22.998 --> 42:24.208
Is that OK?

42:27.378 --> 42:30.464
What of any of this is OK?

42:36.512 --> 42:37.721
It just fucking is.

42:38.639 --> 42:39.598
[sniffs]

42:44.061 --> 42:47.147
My mom, she's been calling and texting.

42:47.773 --> 42:49.692
Justin, shit.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.279
-She's back?
-Yeah.

42:54.780 --> 42:58.450
She's, uh, staying
in our old neighborhood again.

42:59.785 --> 43:00.995
She's in bad shape.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.414
She just wants money.

43:05.958 --> 43:08.919
She doesn't give a fuck
about how I'm doing, of course.

43:12.172 --> 43:13.340
What are you gonna do?

43:18.178 --> 43:20.389
I'm gonna... [puts cup down, sniffs]

43:22.391 --> 43:24.184
I'm gonna keep trying not to die.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.981
Try to stay out of jail. [chuckles]

43:31.483 --> 43:33.068
I feel like, um...

43:36.572 --> 43:39.116
I feel like I can't fucking breathe
at this party.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.122
I feel like everyone knows.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.462
Do you think maybe they do?

43:55.841 --> 43:58.302
[sighs] Diego and Winston, I--

43:58.385 --> 43:59.470
What?

43:59.553 --> 44:00.638
I don't know yet.

44:03.807 --> 44:04.850
Jess...

44:08.062 --> 44:10.898
do you think we're ever gonna
make it out from under this?

44:12.358 --> 44:15.444
-Whoa, what the fuck is going on here?
-Diego...

44:15.527 --> 44:19.031
Foley, are you and me gonna have
a problem? Are we gonna break shit?

44:19.114 --> 44:21.200
-Diego, shut up.
-Most definitely not.

44:21.283 --> 44:22.159
Stop.

44:23.994 --> 44:25.204
[snickers]

44:25.287 --> 44:28.290
I'm just fucking with you, man.
This party's all about love.

44:29.249 --> 44:31.460
Come on, Jess.
I haven't seen you all night.

44:36.757 --> 44:40.094
[Clay] But if you think about it,
the closer you are to someone,

44:43.138 --> 44:44.723
the more secrets you have.

44:47.017 --> 44:48.352
-[smooching]
-[giggles]

44:48.435 --> 44:52.523
Hey, so what's up with you and Winston?
Are you, like, friends?

44:52.606 --> 44:54.650
-We've hung out, why?
-[chuckles]

44:55.025 --> 44:56.485
[Jess] No reason. Just...

44:57.236 --> 44:59.988
I don't know. You don't seem like
you'd have a lot in common.

45:00.656 --> 45:03.534
Well, he was friends with Monty, so...
[smooches]

45:03.909 --> 45:05.285
So you know where they met?

45:05.369 --> 45:06.578
The Hillcrest party?

45:07.329 --> 45:08.497
I mean, yeah.

45:09.039 --> 45:12.292
Did he tell you Monty beat
the living shit out of him that night?

45:13.585 --> 45:15.295
No, that's not true.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.131
Ask anyone from Hillcrest.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.924
People saw it happen.

45:19.466 --> 45:22.386
I don't know.
I guess Monty must have really hated him.

45:23.262 --> 45:25.556
Look, I don't know
what Winston's told you,

45:25.639 --> 45:28.100
but I wouldn't trust him.

45:30.769 --> 45:33.147
-[smooches]
-[suspenseful music plays]

45:35.899 --> 45:38.694
[Clay] We never really tell people
all of how we feel.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.446
Hi!

45:42.740 --> 45:44.742
-Estela!
-Hey!

45:44.825 --> 45:46.577
[Winston] I've been meaning
to talk to you.

45:46.660 --> 45:50.122
Yeah, me too.
I wanted to ask you about my brother.

45:52.416 --> 45:53.709
Look, I...

45:55.419 --> 45:56.879
I want to be honest with you.

45:57.629 --> 46:01.258
We weren't friends, exactly,
but we were...

46:02.718 --> 46:03.677
friendly,

46:05.137 --> 46:06.513
and I've been wondering...

46:08.390 --> 46:10.934
have you ever tried to figure out
what really happened?

46:15.981 --> 46:17.608
Also, in addition,

46:18.442 --> 46:20.736
I'm extremely high right now.

46:20.819 --> 46:23.113
I told you not to eat a second cookie.

46:23.197 --> 46:24.323
I besieged you.

46:24.406 --> 46:26.200
I think you mean "beseech."

46:26.283 --> 46:27.201
Correct.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.412
[Alex] Wait, why is this on?

46:30.496 --> 46:32.039
It's not even Christmas.

46:32.498 --> 46:33.332
Dude...

46:35.000 --> 46:36.710
it's been on since I got here.

46:37.669 --> 46:38.670
You chose it.

46:39.213 --> 46:40.380
I chose it?

46:42.508 --> 46:44.468
No, that doesn't seem like me.

46:45.511 --> 46:46.762
To make a choice.

46:47.888 --> 46:49.097
Nevertheless...

46:50.182 --> 46:51.308
chose you did.

46:51.725 --> 46:53.894
You sounded like Yoda just now.

46:54.812 --> 46:57.940
What if I was Yoda and you didn't know it?

46:58.732 --> 47:01.109
I think I'd know.
I mean, you'd be green, and...

47:02.027 --> 47:03.028
it's a puppet.

47:04.988 --> 47:06.490
I am nobody's puppet.

47:08.075 --> 47:09.785
Nope. You are not.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.286
You are Charlie.

47:11.370 --> 47:13.080
I am Charlie.

47:13.163 --> 47:14.748
Yup. Charles.

47:14.998 --> 47:18.460
Hm, Charles Hayden Brixton Saint George.

47:18.544 --> 47:19.586
Shut up.

47:20.379 --> 47:22.130
No, that is not your name.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.341
Shit you not I,

47:24.967 --> 47:26.176
my name it is.

47:27.010 --> 47:28.095
You're rich.

47:29.054 --> 47:32.391
Nah, just old-school WASP.

47:33.350 --> 47:34.434
No money.

47:34.935 --> 47:36.270
Nice antiques.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.689
[chuckles] You look rich.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.816
Thank you? Or...

47:41.733 --> 47:44.278
-Shut up!
-You're welcome.

47:49.074 --> 47:51.243
Do you think it really is
a wonderful life?

47:53.787 --> 47:54.913

47:55.998 --> 47:56.874

-[boy] Where the hell have you been?

48:17.227 --> 48:19.229
Oh, great. Here it comes.

48:19.521 --> 48:21.857
Logan said he saw you
making out with some guy.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.483
Yeah. So?

48:23.567 --> 48:25.068
You don't own me, Aaron.

-Hey, man, back off.

48:29.114 --> 48:30.574

48:30.657 --> 48:32.492
He's the guy I just had sex with.

Who the fuck are you?

49:31.176 --> 49:32.970
No. He knows we're close.

49:33.512 --> 49:35.597
We gotta figure this out for Monty.

49:37.891 --> 49:38.892
Hey, um...

49:40.185 --> 49:43.397
is it true that Monty beat the shit
out of you at a party?

49:44.272 --> 49:46.525
-Who told you that?
-Jess did.

49:47.359 --> 49:49.861
You said you were friends.
Why the fuck would you lie?

49:50.404 --> 49:52.197
I didn't think you'd understand.

50:01.456 --> 50:03.417
we hooked up at that party.

50:04.626 --> 50:06.169
He didn't want anyone to know,

50:06.253 --> 50:09.589
that's why he beat me up
in front of everyone.

50:10.966 --> 50:14.219
The reason I was with him
the night Bryce died,

50:14.302 --> 50:17.097
and the reason he didn't give an alibi,

50:17.681 --> 50:20.809
is because we were together.

50:22.144 --> 50:23.020
Again.

50:26.898 --> 50:27.941
I'm not...

50:28.400 --> 50:29.943
Monty said he wasn't gay--

50:30.027 --> 50:32.320
No, it's cool if he was.
I just didn't know.

about me and Monty, don't you?

50:42.497 --> 50:43.623
She's playing you.

50:44.207 --> 50:47.044
No, man, she's just looking out for me.

You sure about that?
