I'M SURE I LEFT
MY SKATEBOARD
HERE SOMEWHERE.

00:05.367 --> 00:07.834
YOU GUYS REALLY NEED
TO START KEEPING
BETTER TRACK OF YOUR THINGS.

00:07.834 --> 00:09.500
I SPEND GOOD MONEY
ON YOUR TOYS.

00:09.500 --> 00:13.467
YOU GOT OUR SKATEBOARDS
AT A GARAGE SALE.

00:13.467 --> 00:15.834
FOR A QUARTER.

00:15.834 --> 00:17.867
WHICH WAS
A QUARTER TOO MUCH,

00:17.867 --> 00:19.767
CONSIDERING YOU LOST IT.

00:19.767 --> 00:22.300
I DIDN'T LOSE ANYTHING.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.600
I THINK.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.467
OK, I CAME IN
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR,

00:27.467 --> 00:29.967
SKATED DOWN THE RAMP
AND OVER MOSEBY'S TOES.

00:29.967 --> 00:31.100
WHAT?

00:31.100 --> 00:33.767
SAID I WAS SORRY,

00:33.767 --> 00:35.500
AND HE STARTED TO YELL,
SO I DID A QUICK UEY

00:35.500 --> 00:37.967
AND I DUCKED DOWN
BEHIND THE CANDY COUNTER.

00:38.967 --> 00:40.200
EXCUSE ME.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.500

MY SKATEBOARD

OVER NEAR
THE CANDY COUNTER.

ABOUT THE MONEY.

WE HAVE A PLAY-OFF GAME?

10:46.100 --> 10:49.200
OR HAVE THESE VENTS
GOTTEN SMALLER?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.600
I DON'T KNOW.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.200
BUT I SUGGEST YOU GET
YOUR KNEE OUT OF MY KIDNEY

10:53.200 --> 10:56.700
OR WE'RE ALL GONNA BE SORRY.

10:57.900 --> 11:01.200
HI, DADDY.
ESTEBAN AND I ARE HOME.

11:06.467 --> 11:09.000
OK, HERE YOU GO, MISS HOLLY.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.767
THANKS, ESTEBAN.

11:10.767 --> 11:12.900
MR. O'NEIL.

11:12.900 --> 11:16.734
WAIT. YOU PROMISED
TO BUY SOME OF
MY WILDERNESS GIRL COOKIES.

11:16.734 --> 11:19.900
OH, RIGHT. I LOVE
THE MINT MARSHMALLOW MUSHIES.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.600
WHEN WILL THEY BE HERE?

11:22.600 --> 11:23.900
3 WEEKS.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.300
FROM NEVER.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.367
GOT THE CASH.

11:32.367 --> 11:35.767
PUMPKIN, YOU'RE
A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK.

11:35.767 --> 11:37.567
COME HERE. WHOO-HOO!

11:42.967 --> 11:45.200
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.233
I KNOW. HIS BACK
IS TOTALLY FINE.

11:48.233 --> 11:51.100
NOT THAT.
I BOUGHT A DOZEN BOXES

11:51.100 --> 11:54.600
OF THOSE STUPID MINT
MARSHMALLOW MUSHIES.

12:01.300 --> 12:04.000
MR. MOSEBY, WE'VE GOT
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT
TO TELL YOU.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.667
UNLESS IT CONCERNS
YOUR ENROLLMENT
IN MILITARY SCHOOL,

12:06.667 --> 12:08.367
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

12:09.233 --> 12:11.567
THAT GUY HARRY
IS FAKING HIS INJURY.

12:11.567 --> 12:13.567
WE SAW HIM DANCING
IN THE VENT.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.033
WHY WAS HARRY
DANCING IN THE VENT?

12:16.033 --> 12:18.233
HE WASN'T IN THE VENT.
WE WERE IN THE VENT.

12:18.233 --> 12:19.600
YOU WERE DANCING
IN THE VENT?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.367
NO, WE WERE SPYING
IN THE VENT.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.467
SO WHO WAS DANCING?

12:22.467 --> 12:23.400
HARRY.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.500
HARRY CAN'T DANCE.
HIS BACK IS INJURED.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.200
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN
TRYING TO TELL YOU.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.834
IT'S NOT INJURED.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.400
OH, RIGHT. RIGHT.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.000
AND YOU DIDN'T LEAVE
YOUR SKATEBOARD

12:36.000 --> 12:38.600
IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY LOBBY.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.667
THIS MAN IS A GUEST
IN MY HOTEL,

12:40.667 --> 12:42.133
AND YOU ARE
TO LEAVE HIM ALONE.

12:42.133 --> 12:43.367
BUT--

12:43.367 --> 12:45.000
COME ON--

12:46.100 --> 12:49.000
WHY DO PEOPLE
NEVER BELIEVE ME?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.200
PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOU SAY THINGS

12:51.200 --> 12:53.934
LIKE "THE ELVES DID IT."

12:53.934 --> 12:55.233
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:55.233 --> 12:57.600
DID HOLLY TAKE YOU GUYS
FOR MORE MONEY?

12:57.600 --> 13:00.767
NO. WE SAW HARRY
PICKING HOLLY UP
AND DANCING.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.400
HIS BACK IS FINE,
BUT MOSEBY WON'T BELIEVE US.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.133
WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO PROVE HARRY IS LYING.

13:06.133 --> 13:09.100
IT'S TIME FOR "OPERATION
SMOKE OUT THE RAT."

13:09.100 --> 13:10.200
ARE YOU GUYS IN?

13:10.200 --> 13:11.700
I'M IN.

13:11.700 --> 13:12.834
ME, TOO.

13:12.834 --> 13:16.567
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS
"OPERATION SMOKE OUT THE RAT"?

13:16.567 --> 13:18.934
BEATS ME. I JUST
COME UP WITH THE NAMES.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.500
All: 1, 2, 3, BREAK!

13:34.900 --> 13:36.200
THERE YOU ARE.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.567
MR. O'NEIL, THE ONE WHO HURT
HIS BACK, JUST CALLED.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.100
OH, MY. HOW DID
HE SOUND? BETTER?

13:41.100 --> 13:43.500
WORSE? LIKE HE
WAS GOING TO SUE?

13:43.500 --> 13:46.767
HE JUST SAID HE NEEDS
TO SEE YOU IN HIS SUITE
RIGHT AWAY.

13:46.767 --> 13:48.567
OH, AND TAKE
YOUR PASSKEY.

13:48.567 --> 13:49.934
BECAUSE HE CAN'T
ANSWER THE DOOR.

13:49.934 --> 13:51.500
RIGHT.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.467
GO.

13:52.467 --> 13:53.667
OH.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.500
RUN!

13:56.934 --> 13:59.834
"OPERATION SMOKE OUT
THE RAT" IS A GO.

13:59.834 --> 14:03.300
CRANKY PANTS IS
ON HIS WAY UP. OVER.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.934
COPY THAT, CANDY GIRL.
BETTER-LOOKING TWIN OUT.

14:06.934 --> 14:10.400
YOU KNOW, NEXT TIME
I'M PICKING THE NAMES.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.300
COPY THAT, THUMB SUCKER.

14:13.734 --> 14:15.767
OK, WE HAVE
TO TIME THIS PERFECTLY

14:15.767 --> 14:18.500
SO HARRY IS JUMPING AROUND
WHEN CRANKY PANTS WALKS IN.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.300
DON'T WORRY.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.300
I'VE GOT THIS BEE
STINGING MAD.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.233
WHERE DID YOU GET A BEE?

14:27.233 --> 14:29.900
I KNOW A GUY.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.900
[BUZZING]

14:34.900 --> 14:37.300
GET AWAY.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.233
GET AWAY!

14:44.900 --> 14:47.500
ALL RIGHT. OK.
YOU WANNA PLAY BEE BALL?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.200
AH!

14:53.300 --> 14:54.667
GOT IT.

14:54.667 --> 14:58.000
[CRYING]

14:58.000 --> 15:00.200
[KNOCKING]

15:02.100 --> 15:04.300
MR. O'NEIL, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

15:04.300 --> 15:07.200
YEAH. BUT A SWARM OF BEES
JUST FLEW OUT OF THAT VENT
AND ATTACKED ME.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.233
YOU DON'T
WANT PEOPLE TO HEAR

15:09.233 --> 15:11.767
THAT THE TIPTON'S
INFESTED WITH BEES.

15:11.767 --> 15:14.000
WOULD YOU LIKE A FREE DINNER?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.500
WELL, IF YOU INSIST.

15:18.900 --> 15:21.867
OK, COAST IS CLEAR.
PROCEED DOWN HALLWAY.

15:27.300 --> 15:30.900
I'M STANDING
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.600
DO WE HAVE A LOCATION
ON CRANKY PANTS?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.967
CANDY GIRL SAYS CRANKY PANTS
IS ON THE WAY UP NOW.

15:36.967 --> 15:39.133
ALL RIGHT.
YOU READY, RED SCHNOZ?

15:39.133 --> 15:42.700
I'M READY,
SOON TO BE FAT LIP.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.900
OK. THIS IS DEFINITELY
GOING TO GET HARRY UP

15:45.900 --> 15:47.500
AND RUNNING OUT
OF HIS ROOM.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.767
AND WHEN HE DOES,

15:48.767 --> 15:52.100
I'LL TAKE A PICTURE OF IT
AND SHOW IT TO MOSEBY.

15:52.100 --> 15:56.934
WHOA. THE SWEDISH BIKINI
TEAM IS ON THIS FLOOR?

15:56.934 --> 15:59.967
[WITH SWEDISH ACCENT]
OH, IT'S SO COLD IN HERE.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.300
I SHOULD'VE WORN MORE CLOTHES.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.200
Man: HEY, I WANT
AN AUTOGRAPH!

16:14.300 --> 16:17.000
COME ON, CODY. GET UP.
YOU'RE GONNA MISS THE SHOT.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.133
GIDDYUP. YAH! YAH!

16:21.400 --> 16:24.367
YOU MEAN AFTER ALL THAT,
YOU STILL DIDN'T GET A PICTURE?

16:24.367 --> 16:25.500
WELL, I'M SORRY.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.200
MY PHOTOGRAPHER
FELL DOWN ON THE JOB.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.834
[GROANING]

16:30.834 --> 16:33.133
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL GET HIM.

16:33.133 --> 16:34.600
MAYBE WE SHOULD
TELL YOUR MOM.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.600
SHE'LL NEVER BELIEVE US.

16:36.600 --> 16:41.400
SHE MIGHT, IF IT
DOESN'T INVOLVE ELVES.
CODY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

16:41.400 --> 16:44.233
HE WAS TRYING
TO HELP ME PROVE THAT
HARRY ISN'T REALLY HURT.

16:44.233 --> 16:47.600
ZACK, YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP
INVOLVING PEOPLE IN YOUR
HARE-BRAINED SCHEMES.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.700
LOOK, MOM, I KNOW ZACK
HAS LIED IN THE PAST

16:50.700 --> 16:53.400
AND NO DOUBT
HE'LL LIE IN THE FUTURE,

16:53.400 --> 16:55.200
BUT AT THIS MOMENT,

16:55.200 --> 16:57.667
HE HAPPENS
TO BE TELLING THE TRUTH.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.600
THANKS, BUDDY.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.133
OW.

17:02.133 --> 17:04.500
CAREY, I BELIEVE HIM, TOO.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.033
THAT LITTLE GIRL
CONNED ME OUT OF ALL MY CANDY.

17:07.033 --> 17:08.400
YOU MEAN
SWEET LITTLE HOLLY

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
WHO SOLD ME THE LOW-FAT
LEMON LOOLOOS?

17:10.400 --> 17:14.100
THEY'RE LOW-FAT ALL RIGHT
BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA GET 'EM.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.300
MOM, I PROMISE
I'LL NEVER LIE AGAIN

17:16.300 --> 17:18.300
IF YOU JUST
BELIEVE ME NOW.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.567
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DO.

17:20.567 --> 17:24.800
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO GET A SECOND OPINION
ON HARRY'S BACK INJURY.

17:24.800 --> 17:25.867
LET'S GO.

17:25.867 --> 17:27.367
[GROANS]

17:27.934 --> 17:30.567
1, 2, CHA, CHA, CHA.

17:30.567 --> 17:33.100
1, 2, CHA, CHA, CHA.

17:36.867 --> 17:38.133
[KNOCKING]

17:38.967 --> 17:40.233
WHO IS IT?

17:40.233 --> 17:41.600
CAREY!

17:41.600 --> 17:43.400
AND HER BROWNIES!

17:45.233 --> 17:47.367
UH, JUST A SECOND.

17:49.300 --> 17:52.600
COME IN.
THE DOOR IS OPEN.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.500
HI, HARRY.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.467
BUT I FEEL SO BAD
THAT MY SON'S SKATEBOARD
CAUSED YOUR INJURY

18:00.467 --> 18:01.867
THAT I'VE HIRED
AT MY OWN EXPENSE

18:01.867 --> 18:03.834
THE BEST PHYSICAL
THERAPIST IN BOSTON.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.133
OH. UH, WOW. YEAH. UH...

18:06.133 --> 18:07.300
YEAH. YOU DESERVE IT.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.967
NO, I DON'T.

18:08.967 --> 18:09.934
YEAH, YOU DO.

18:09.934 --> 18:11.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.967
ALL I NEED TO FEEL BETTER
ARE YOUR BROWNIES.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.667
NO, I INSIST.
OLGA IS THE BEST.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.300
SHE HAS THE GENTLEST TOUCH.

18:24.033 --> 18:26.700
I FIX BOO-BOO NOW.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.133
UH...UH...

18:29.133 --> 18:30.600
YEAH. YOU KNOW,

18:30.600 --> 18:33.500
I THINK MY BOO-BOO
JUST NEEDS A LITTLE REST.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.600
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW
ABOUT BOO-BOOS? BUPKIS.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.400
YOU KNOW BUPKIS
ABOUT BOO-BOOS.
I KNOW BOO-BOOS.

18:39.400 --> 18:43.734
NOW, ON COUNT OF 3,
WE FLIP HIM LIKE BLINI.

18:43.734 --> 18:44.734
WAIT.

18:44.734 --> 18:46.200
3.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.900
WHAT HAPPENED
TO "1" AND "2"?

18:50.900 --> 18:55.000
I SPIT ON "1" AND "2."

18:56.367 --> 18:59.100
SO I GOT YOU DOWN
FOR 5 BOXES OF MINT
MARSHMALLOW MUSHIES

18:59.100 --> 19:01.900
AND 5 BOXES
OF CHIP-A-DEE-DOO-DAHS.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.000
I BELIEVE I SAID I ONLY
WANTED ONE BOX OF EACH.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.300
BUT 10 MORE
AND I WIN THE BICYCLE,

19:06.300 --> 19:08.500
AND I'VE NEVER
HAD A BICYCLE.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.000
WHAT THE HECK.
MAKE IT 20 BOXES.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.400
BUY YOURSELF A HORN.
HONK HONK!

19:18.000 --> 19:22.100
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
AND...RUDOLPH ARE DOING HERE,

19:22.100 --> 19:24.934
BUT I'M SURE IT'S GONNA
GIVE ME THAT STOMACH PAIN.

19:24.934 --> 19:26.867
SO MOVE AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.867
THERE'S A PERFECTLY
LOGICAL EXPLANATION

19:28.867 --> 19:32.000
OF WHY WE'RE STANDING
HERE AND CAN'T MOVE.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.767
TELL HIM, RUDOLPH.

19:36.900 --> 19:39.300
DOES THIS FEEL GOOD?

19:39.300 --> 19:41.000
ACTUALLY, YES.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.033
HOW ABOUT THIS?

19:43.033 --> 19:44.600
YEAH.

19:47.467 --> 19:48.934
GOOD.

19:48.934 --> 19:51.200
NOW WE DO RUSSIAN
ACUPUNCTURE.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.867
I NEVER HEARD OF--AH!

19:55.734 --> 19:58.800
OK, YOU KNOW,
I THINK WE'RE GOOD
WITH THE LITTLE NEEDLE.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.400
HE'S RIGHT.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.800
TIME FOR HOT ROCKS.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.033
HOT ROCKS?

20:04.300 --> 20:06.367
TO RELAX YOUR MUSCLES!

20:07.467 --> 20:12.400
AND THAT'S HOW OUR SHOES
GOT GLUED TO THE FLOOR.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.800
NO WONDER
YOU NEVER LIE.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.300
YOU STINK AT IT.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.367
Harry: AAH!

20:18.367 --> 20:19.867
DADDY!

20:20.800 --> 20:23.600
AAH!

20:23.600 --> 20:24.300
NO!

20:24.300 --> 20:26.734
DADDY! AAH!

20:26.734 --> 20:29.967
HOLLY. PUMPKIN,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:29.967 --> 20:32.300
I THINK SO.

20:32.300 --> 20:36.000
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE MADE
A REMARKABLE RECOVERY,
MR. O'NEIL.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.200
IT'S A MIRACLE!

20:40.100 --> 20:43.100
THAT PHYSICAL THERAPIST
IS AMAZING.

20:45.867 --> 20:47.000
MADDIE?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.400
<i>JA. JA. </i>I MEAN YES.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.500
YOU MEAN OUR
CANDY-COUNTER GIRL?

20:53.500 --> 20:56.000
I TOLD YOU HE WAS FAKING.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.900
OH, ZACK, I AM SO SORRY
I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.867
OF COURSE NOTHING
IN YOUR PAST WOULD HAVE
LED ME TO BELIEVE YOU.

21:01.867 --> 21:03.867
NONETHELESS, THIS ONE
PARTICULAR INSTAN--

21:03.867 --> 21:06.900
APOLOGY ACCEPTED,
MR. MOSEBY.

21:06.900 --> 21:09.834
MR. O'NEIL,
I HAVE A GOOD MIND
TO CALL THE POLICE.

21:09.834 --> 21:11.500
WHIPLASH.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.500
OH! I CAN'T SEE.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.033
GIVE IT UP, HONEY.

21:16.033 --> 21:17.867
WE'RE CAUGHT.

21:17.867 --> 21:21.200
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD
USE YOUR SWEET LITTLE
DAUGHTER TO SCAM PEOPLE.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.700
"OPERATION SKATEBOARD
IN THE LOBBY" WAS HER IDEA.

21:23.700 --> 21:27.400
I JUST COME UP
WITH THE NAMES.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.000
SHE'S 42 INCHES
OF PURE EVIL.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.967
[GRUNTS]
MMMM!

21:31.967 --> 21:33.400
WIMP.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.967
OH, MR. O'NEIL.
MR. O'NEIL.

21:36.967 --> 21:38.467
I HAD TO GO ALL
THE WAY TO DELAWARE,

21:38.467 --> 21:40.300
BUT I FINALLY FOUND
THAT PILLOW YOU REQUESTED.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.600
FORGET IT, ESTEBAN.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.100
WE PROVED HE WAS FAKING.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.033
SO YOU'RE DONE
WORKING FOR HIM.

21:45.033 --> 21:46.400
SO I CAN TAKE
A LITTLE BREAK?

21:46.400 --> 21:47.133
BY ALL MEANS.

21:47.133 --> 21:49.300
OH, <i>GRACIAS. </i>

21:58.734 --> 22:00.600
MR. MOSEBY, WE WANNA
APOLOGIZE AGAIN,

22:00.600 --> 22:03.000
AND WE'RE GONNA PAY BACK
EVERY PENNY WE OWE YOU.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.233
THAT'S RIGHT.
I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON.

22:06.233 --> 22:09.467
AND I HAVE
ALERTED EVERY HOTEL
ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD.

22:09.467 --> 22:13.367
DON'T WORRY. FROM NOW ON,
WE ARE GONNA WALK
THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.

22:13.367 --> 22:14.300

22:17.667 --> 22:19.300
THANK YOU, MR. DOORMAN.

22:19.300 --> 22:22.200
