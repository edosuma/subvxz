WEBVTT

01:19.583 --> 01:21.042
One, two, three.

01:21.125 --> 01:21.917
Come on, Sasha!

01:22.000 --> 01:23.292
Guys, catch up to them!

01:26.875 --> 01:28.000
Come on, Olga!

01:28.417 --> 01:30.250
You guys are too slow!

01:31.792 --> 01:34.667
Well, Stas? Well?

01:34.750 --> 01:37.000
- Who's the boss?
- We buried you.

01:37.083 --> 01:38.667
You'd be less mouthy at soccer.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.167
Yeah, right.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.750
What's the matter, Andrei, you dead?

01:42.833 --> 01:44.000
Such a wimp.

01:44.083 --> 01:46.708
Sasha, Olga!
What the hell are you doing?

01:51.375 --> 01:52.458
Hi, Vastly.

01:52.542 --> 01:55.292
Hi. Test training session,
on the double.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.000
We're out of water.

02:02.083 --> 02:03.417
I'll fill it up.

02:03.917 --> 02:06.458
- The spray's not working.
- Put some on the upper bar.

02:06.542 --> 02:07.708
Hold on.

02:08.458 --> 02:09.583
Go ahead.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.458
Good luck.

02:15.542 --> 02:16.792
Go ahead, Olga.

02:24.708 --> 02:25.917
Full stretch!

02:26.000 --> 02:27.625
Come on, nail it.

02:27.708 --> 02:29.708
- Watch your posture.
- Use your hands.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.333
Easy. Come on, come on.
Keep going.

02:34.708 --> 02:35.875
You're strong enough.

02:35.958 --> 02:36.750
Watch your hands!

02:38.375 --> 02:39.333
Good.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.042
Straighten your back.

02:46.125 --> 02:47.625
Point your toes!

02:49.292 --> 02:50.375
Full stretch!

02:52.250 --> 02:53.292
Good job.

02:55.458 --> 02:56.250
Sasha, go ahead.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.833
I'm not fully using my hands.

03:04.917 --> 03:07.000
And I'm not extending my legs.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.417
Same with my toes.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.958
The next step will be the Jaeger.

03:11.208 --> 03:14.292
With the Jaeger,
you'll blow them away in the Euro.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.625
You're capable of it, Olga.

03:24.375 --> 03:25.417
Hey, Mom.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.958
Hey, lovebug.

03:27.917 --> 03:31.167
We have to be here tomorrow
at 1:30 pm for the tournament.

03:32.208 --> 03:33.375
Yeah, I know.

03:33.458 --> 03:36.000
I talked to Sasha's parents.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.083
They'll pick you up at noon.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.833
Aren't you taking me?

03:43.875 --> 03:45.125
I can't.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.708
I really have to be
in the newsroom tomorrow.

03:49.292 --> 03:51.583
I'm working on an important article.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.625
It's due tomorrow...

03:53.708 --> 03:56.208
What about my tournament,
isn't that important?

03:56.292 --> 03:59.583
There's only two left before the Euro.

03:59.667 --> 04:02.208
I kept tomorrow night open for you.

04:02.292 --> 04:03.083
Great.

04:03.167 --> 04:06.958
We'll go out to dinner,
just the two of us.

04:07.625 --> 04:08.583
Fine.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.958
I don't need your night out.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.625
That's the fifth time.
"My article, my article..."

04:16.083 --> 04:19.250
What if I help you finish it
instead of going to the tournament?

04:19.833 --> 04:21.875
Let's not ruin the evening.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.333
And since when do you need me?

04:27.417 --> 04:29.250
My warrior who wins every tournament?

04:29.333 --> 04:30.167
Leave me alone.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.458
You always get your way, don't you?

04:47.375 --> 04:49.000
They're building fast.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.958
With all the bribes
they give to the Mayor...

04:59.333 --> 05:02.500
I had written
about illegal construction sites.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.583
But nothing's changed.

05:04.667 --> 05:07.417
People either don't care
or they're too scared.

05:11.292 --> 05:13.792
Just once in your life,

05:13.875 --> 05:16.125
you could at least pretend
to be listening.

05:17.042 --> 05:19.333
But you're just rambling, Mom.

05:21.917 --> 05:23.042
Are you hungry?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.542
Mom, what's going on?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Faster!

05:47.542 --> 05:49.125
Mom, the streetcar!

05:59.542 --> 06:01.000
They're gone.

06:04.042 --> 06:05.250
Are you okay?

06:12.792 --> 06:13.583
Bastards!

06:14.375 --> 06:15.958
I knew it!

06:19.750 --> 06:21.292
It's okay, Mom.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.500
I'm sorry.

07:30.875 --> 07:31.708
Hi.

07:32.417 --> 07:33.583
Hi.

07:33.667 --> 07:34.958
- Hello, young lady.
- Hello.

07:35.042 --> 07:37.250
- How was the trip?
- How are you?

07:37.333 --> 07:38.792
Great, thanks. Hi.

07:38.875 --> 07:39.958
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.875
Here's the folder. It's all there,
including her mom's number.

07:42.958 --> 07:45.000
But don't hesitate to call me
if need be.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.208
Thanks. The insurance release as well?

07:47.292 --> 07:49.042
Yes, everything's in the folder.

07:54.167 --> 07:55.292
There you go.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.125
Welcome.

07:58.250 --> 08:01.333
Follow me.
Let me show you your room.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.000
This way.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.125
Here's the bathroom.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.750
There you go. Please feel at home.

08:17.458 --> 08:18.667
It's beautiful.

08:19.042 --> 08:21.083
Great. Glad to hear.

08:22.833 --> 08:25.417
I'll let you get settled, okay?

08:25.500 --> 08:26.417
Thanks.

08:52.708 --> 08:56.625
This is llona. Please leave a message.

08:58.042 --> 09:00.000
I made it there, call me back.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.458
You're in my thoughts.
Love, Mom

09:39.333 --> 09:40.750
Don't worry.

11:29.125 --> 11:32.250
Hey, Sasha.
I just made it to the Center.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.417
I can finally get back to it.

11:36.375 --> 11:39.167
The gym is so cool. I'll show you.

11:39.250 --> 11:43.250
You're not gonna believe it.
It's not like that dump in Kyiv.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.792
Here's the beam,
check out how long it is.

11:46.875 --> 11:48.000
Then there's...

11:48.708 --> 11:49.833
the bars.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.417
It's actually like back home,

11:54.500 --> 11:56.000
except a lot classier.

11:58.625 --> 11:59.917
Yeah, well...

12:04.417 --> 12:05.375
Anyway...

12:05.458 --> 12:09.708
I'm gonna try the Jaeger.
I can show you, if you want.

12:10.167 --> 12:12.292
Other than that, I miss you guys.

12:12.375 --> 12:13.958
I hope to see you soon.

12:18.042 --> 12:19.708
Check this out, girl.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.125
Let me show you who's boss.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.375
Shit.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.208
Damn, did you see what she did?

12:53.458 --> 12:55.542
You okay? Did you hurt yourself?

12:55.917 --> 12:56.917
No.

12:57.417 --> 12:58.375
I'm Steffi.

12:58.458 --> 12:59.250
Hi.

12:59.708 --> 13:00.500
Olga.

13:00.583 --> 13:01.792
I'm the team captain.

13:01.875 --> 13:04.583
Come see me if you have a problem.
Okay?

13:04.667 --> 13:05.458
Olga.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.625
- Were you doing the Jaeger on your own?
- No.

13:07.708 --> 13:09.542
Don't train on your own. Okay?

13:09.625 --> 13:12.042
- Okay.
- I mean it. Don't do that again.

13:13.625 --> 13:14.667
Hi, girls, how are you?

13:14.750 --> 13:15.917
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
How are you feeling?
How's your back, Naomi?

13:18.083 --> 13:19.750
- Better.
- Okay, great.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.708
- You okay, Steffi?
- Yeah.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.250
- How's that elbow, Justine?
- Good.

13:23.333 --> 13:24.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:24.583 --> 13:25.750
Hi.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.958
Well, girls, as you can see,

13:29.042 --> 13:31.958
we have a new gymnast today.
This is Olga.

13:32.042 --> 13:33.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:33.333 --> 13:36.458
Olga might join the National Team.

13:36.542 --> 13:39.458
She's gonna train with us
for the competitions.

13:40.208 --> 13:41.833
It's a trial period for now,

13:41.917 --> 13:44.667
but I'm counting on you all
to make her feel welcome.

13:45.417 --> 13:47.917
Let's start with cardio. Move it.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.500
In rhythm, girls.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.125
Come on.

14:05.708 --> 14:09.083
Again. And... go.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.667
Five, four, three,

14:13.083 --> 14:14.708
two, one, go.

14:18.542 --> 14:19.667
Watch out!

14:20.750 --> 14:21.833
Can't you see the sequence?

14:21.917 --> 14:23.625
- I can.
- Go to the climbing rope.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.042
Come on.

14:27.042 --> 14:28.250
Do you wanna go?

14:29.333 --> 14:30.958
Steffi, go to the bars.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.542
Come on, Olga, climb.

14:44.833 --> 14:45.958
Shit...

14:57.458 --> 14:59.083
Here, that's for your hands.

14:59.792 --> 15:00.875
Thanks.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.542
You're from Kyiv, is that it?

15:18.250 --> 15:19.583
Yes. And you?

15:20.667 --> 15:23.875
From Satigny, near Meyrin.
You don't know where that is, do you?

15:24.375 --> 15:26.083
She obviously doesn't.

15:26.542 --> 15:28.792
- How could she know?
- Don't worry about it.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.833
Nobody knows where it is,
it's bumfuck nowhere.

15:30.917 --> 15:33.167
Hey, knock it off.
You're the bumfucks.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.792
It's true, though.

15:37.167 --> 15:39.000
What's a "bumfuck?"

15:39.083 --> 15:40.250
Who wants to explain?

15:43.042 --> 15:44.250
How can I put it?

15:44.333 --> 15:45.833
I don't know. Figure it out.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.167
Let's see...

15:47.250 --> 15:49.875
- I'll give you five bucks if you do it.
- Forget it.

15:51.917 --> 15:54.667
Forget it, she doesn't understand.
Let's go.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.333
Yeah, the bell's about to ring.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.083
Don't forget to call me.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.292
Yeah.

16:05.083 --> 16:06.167
- I'm ready.
- Ready?

16:06.250 --> 16:07.583
- Yeah.
- Shall we?

16:09.708 --> 16:10.917
Let's go, girls.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.375
It looks big.

16:34.375 --> 16:35.458
It's cool.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.667
I feel reassured.

16:40.042 --> 16:43.625
Mom, you never answer when I call.

16:43.708 --> 16:45.083
I was really worried.

16:45.167 --> 16:46.667
Don't worry, everything's fine.

16:47.125 --> 16:50.375
Are you kidding me?
I know you're in danger.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.917
Of course I'm worried.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.958
Don't be.

16:55.042 --> 16:57.167
I just got back
from the newsroom with Stas,

16:57.250 --> 16:58.750
you know how burly he is.

16:58.833 --> 17:00.542
Everything's fine, I'm telling you.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.458
Did they arrest them?

17:03.375 --> 17:06.166
Of course not,
they'll never get arrested.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.166
That's fucked up.

17:08.250 --> 17:09.625
It is.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.083
Listen, we need to talk
about your application.

17:14.416 --> 17:16.000
Did you send it?

17:16.875 --> 17:20.416
You need to sign it,
otherwise I won't be able to stay.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.958
And I can kiss the Euro goodbye.
The selection is a month from now.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.125
You don't get it.
It's not that simple.

17:27.041 --> 17:30.333
Mom, that's my only chance
to compete in the Euro.

17:30.417 --> 17:34.542
Olga, they're asking you
to become a Swiss citizen.

17:36.833 --> 17:40.375
Ukraine doesn't allow dual citizenship.

17:40.917 --> 17:43.458
I'm already half Swiss.

17:43.958 --> 17:46.542
Yeah, right, half Swiss.

17:46.625 --> 17:49.667
Especially since this Swiss half
has only seen

17:49.750 --> 17:54.083
her father's side of the family
twice in her entire life.

17:54.167 --> 17:56.083
I don't even know what to say.

17:56.542 --> 18:00.042
You just can't be a dual citizen.

18:01.833 --> 18:05.292
Do you understand
how important this choice is?

18:05.375 --> 18:08.500
Look, the foster home
is right across from the gym.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.375
Are you even listening to me?

18:12.083 --> 18:15.792
Mom, it's not my fault if I'm here.

18:16.417 --> 18:17.333
Well...

18:17.792 --> 18:19.708
You're the one who's in trouble,
not me.

18:20.708 --> 18:24.333
I understand you're totally focused
on gymnastics.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
But how long will that last?

18:27.417 --> 18:30.917
Two, three years? Maybe five?

18:31.583 --> 18:33.875
Have you thought about your future?

18:33.958 --> 18:37.500
If you don't sign, I'll do it for you.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.500
How are you doing?

18:47.833 --> 18:49.125
Okay.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.792
Have you made any friends?

18:57.333 --> 18:58.500
Almost.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.750
What do you mean, "almost?"

19:07.750 --> 19:09.667
I don't understand them well.

19:12.792 --> 19:14.250
Don't cry.

19:19.958 --> 19:20.875
Anyway...

19:23.250 --> 19:25.292
You're my warrior, right?

19:27.167 --> 19:30.708
Okay. Alright, Mom. Bye.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.042
- Good night.
- I love you.

19:33.750 --> 19:34.625
I love you, too.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.167
Good night.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.208
Bohdia was the boss of all spiders

20:14.292 --> 20:16.500
He ate flies and mosquitoes

20:16.583 --> 20:19.125
He even ate out of my hands

20:19.208 --> 20:21.750
He was a well-trained spider!

20:21.833 --> 20:24.417
Bohdia was the boss of all spiders

20:24.500 --> 20:26.583
He ate flies and mosquitoes

20:29.875 --> 20:31.458
Too bad, Bohdia...

21:45.792 --> 21:47.792
Check out her body alignment.

21:47.875 --> 21:50.875
Her style is so fluid.
Look at that side flip.

21:55.417 --> 21:59.042
That rhythm. It's really beautiful.

21:59.958 --> 22:01.333
Yeah, well...

22:01.417 --> 22:03.500
That was two years ago.
Didn't you see her yesterday?

22:04.083 --> 22:04.875
True that.

22:04.958 --> 22:08.042
Come on, Juliette.
She hasn't practiced in weeks.

22:08.417 --> 22:09.792
Let her get her feet wet.

22:13.000 --> 22:13.917
Hey.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.125
Hey.

22:21.167 --> 22:23.833
Hi, Olga.
Do you have your school stuff?

22:24.875 --> 22:26.042
- No.
- You don't?

22:26.125 --> 22:27.625
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:27.708 --> 22:28.583
Bye.

22:29.375 --> 22:32.583
We're gonna meet every week
to work on your French.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.792
You can't just show up late
and nonchalantly.

22:34.875 --> 22:35.667
Do you understand?

22:36.917 --> 22:39.708
We're still gonna try
to get a little work done.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.333
Have a seat, I'll get you a pen.

22:41.417 --> 22:42.583
Yes, sir.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.708
What was that?
You call that a landing?

22:59.792 --> 23:01.833
- Don't you know any better?
- Leave me alone.

23:02.375 --> 23:03.625
Did you say something?

23:04.583 --> 23:06.750
You got something to tell me?

23:07.375 --> 23:09.542
I won't tolerate that attitude.

23:20.292 --> 23:21.000
No!

23:21.792 --> 23:22.667
Not like that.

23:24.125 --> 23:26.667
I'm asking you to do the Tkatchev.
Okay?

23:26.750 --> 23:27.875
Yes.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.583
Come on, Olga. Tkatchev.

23:32.167 --> 23:33.000
Come on.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.167
Olga, no. Olga.

23:41.708 --> 23:45.625
You don't get it. The Tkatchev.
The reverse grip is a Jaeger. Hey.

23:51.667 --> 23:52.708
Unbelievable.

23:53.625 --> 23:54.792
Step away.

23:54.875 --> 23:55.833
Steffi.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.625
- Can you show her the Tkatchev?
- Yeah.

23:58.708 --> 23:59.875
Olga, watch.

24:09.958 --> 24:10.875
There you go.

24:14.708 --> 24:16.708
Very good. Excellent. Great job.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.667
Just like that, Olga.

24:21.875 --> 24:22.875
Come on.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.042
Come on, Olga. Tkatchev, okay?

24:30.750 --> 24:32.583
No! Olga!

24:34.500 --> 24:37.625
Not the Jaeger, the Tkatchev.
I keep telling you.

24:37.708 --> 24:39.458
Back home, I don't do like you do.

24:39.542 --> 24:40.625
You're not ready.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.667
You're not ready for the Jaeger.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.208
No way.
You're gonna hurt your back.

24:44.292 --> 24:46.167
I need the Jaeger for the Euro.

24:46.625 --> 24:48.125
Not your stupid moves.

24:48.208 --> 24:49.792
- Excuse me?
- Get lost.

24:49.875 --> 24:51.875
<i>Hey. You can't speak Russian here.</i>

24:51.958 --> 24:54.167
We don't understand.
It's either French or German.

24:54.625 --> 24:55.958
The girls don't understand.

24:56.042 --> 24:56.958
Tkatchev?

24:57.625 --> 24:59.458
That's what I've been asking you.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.917
Don't play me for a fool
if you wanna stay here, okay?

25:19.625 --> 25:20.958
Okay.

25:45.750 --> 25:47.250
Why are you here?

25:47.333 --> 25:48.292
Here?

25:50.625 --> 25:52.542
What the hell are you doing
in Switzerland?

25:54.125 --> 25:55.792
My father is Swiss.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.208
And what does he do?

26:00.875 --> 26:02.125
He's dead.

26:03.958 --> 26:05.000
Sorry.

26:05.750 --> 26:06.750
It's okay.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.333
There's also my mom.

26:09.875 --> 26:13.667
Because of her work,
I really had to leave.

26:14.875 --> 26:18.542
She writes on the Internet
about Yanukovych.

26:18.625 --> 26:19.875
Yanu-what?

26:20.667 --> 26:22.875
Ya-nu-ko-vych.

26:23.542 --> 26:25.542
The President of Ukraine.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.125
Got it.

26:28.917 --> 26:31.625
He wanted to kill my mom and me.

26:34.667 --> 26:36.500
That's why I'm here.

26:44.750 --> 26:48.292
People can't speak freely.

26:50.125 --> 26:52.083
You run the risk of being spied on.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.417
Take my mom, for example...

26:58.125 --> 26:59.625
Coming from Ukraine,

26:59.708 --> 27:02.708
you realize things aren't so bad
elsewhere.

27:03.875 --> 27:06.083
When you live in Ukraine,

27:06.167 --> 27:09.542
you understand
that other countries carry fleas.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.625
The ruling power takes the people
for idiots.

27:19.458 --> 27:21.750
The people hold a moron.

27:36.792 --> 27:40.000
And one. And two. Activate.

27:41.000 --> 27:41.833
And three.

27:44.042 --> 27:45.167
Two.

27:46.958 --> 27:47.833
Three.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.792
Arms straight and...

27:51.583 --> 27:52.792
That was better.

27:55.417 --> 27:56.333
Very good.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.500
Are you starting to get the Jaeger?

27:59.125 --> 28:02.667
Come on, take this off.
Let's see if you belong here.

28:12.042 --> 28:12.875
Come on.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.708
Come on, strong swing.
There you go.

28:22.833 --> 28:24.583
Okay, great. And...

28:28.417 --> 28:29.333
Strong.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.042
There you go! Now we're talking.

28:32.917 --> 28:34.458
That was a beautiful Jaeger.

28:37.167 --> 28:38.250
Very good.

28:39.167 --> 28:40.417
Come on, that's enough.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.000
Hey, Olga.

28:43.583 --> 28:45.708
That's it for today.
You're gonna hurt yourself. Stop.

28:53.042 --> 28:55.042
See? What did I say?

28:55.125 --> 28:56.917
You're too tired.
Enough, you're done.

28:57.708 --> 28:59.875
Stretch and then beddy-byes.

28:59.958 --> 29:00.833
Beddy-byes?

29:00.917 --> 29:03.083
Yeah, beddy-byes. That means sleep.

29:03.167 --> 29:07.000
French. Go learn French
instead of cursing me out in Russian.

29:07.083 --> 29:08.083
Ciao!

29:08.792 --> 29:09.875
See you tomorrow.

29:19.333 --> 29:20.833
Vasily's gone?

29:20.917 --> 29:22.875
Yeah. He left on a whim.

29:22.958 --> 29:25.042
Damn, just before the Euro?

29:25.125 --> 29:26.708
Yeah, I don't know
what we're gonna do.

29:26.792 --> 29:28.792
Holy shit, that's crazy.

29:28.875 --> 29:32.042
I guess the Russians made him
a better offer.

29:32.625 --> 29:35.083
Either that or he really wants
to dope his athletes.

29:35.167 --> 29:36.250
Maybe.

29:36.333 --> 29:39.500
Oh, by the way, the new coach...

29:39.583 --> 29:40.542
What about her?

29:40.625 --> 29:42.875
She's clueless.

29:42.958 --> 29:45.125
We'll never be ready
for the championship.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.375
Who's going with you to the Euro?

29:47.458 --> 29:50.500
Alla, Polina, Masha, and Katya.

29:50.917 --> 29:52.167
What about Vika and Tanya?

29:52.250 --> 29:55.958
Vika's on the Azerbaijani Team now.

29:56.417 --> 30:00.417
And Tanya left when the coach did.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.708
Who's that?
Is she the one who took my spot?

30:04.625 --> 30:05.667
Sasha?

30:06.208 --> 30:09.917
Hold on, let me go outside... Yeah.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.000
That's the new girl.

30:12.083 --> 30:13.583
What is she like?

30:13.667 --> 30:16.083
She gets on my nerves.

30:16.792 --> 30:19.208
And on top of that,
I swear, she stinks.

30:19.292 --> 30:21.250
She's a handful, I tell you.

30:22.292 --> 30:23.417
She stinks?

30:23.500 --> 30:24.500
Yes.

30:24.583 --> 30:27.292
It's like she never showers.

30:27.375 --> 30:28.750
She's terrible.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.208
What about over there?

30:31.875 --> 30:32.958
What?

30:33.917 --> 30:35.625
How are the Swiss?

30:37.417 --> 30:38.875
Pretty proficient.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.250
It's okay.

30:41.333 --> 30:43.125
The showers are great

30:43.208 --> 30:46.208
and there's also a sauna

30:46.292 --> 30:48.750
and a swimming pool.

30:49.917 --> 30:51.625
So you're Swiss now?

30:52.125 --> 30:53.542
Oh, stop it.

30:54.625 --> 30:56.792
When are you coming back?

30:56.875 --> 30:58.500
Soon.

30:58.833 --> 31:01.958
Watch out, I'm the boss now.

31:02.458 --> 31:03.583
Yeah, right.

31:03.667 --> 31:06.875
Until I come back, at least.

31:09.500 --> 31:13.250
Yeah. But you're not coming back,
are you?

31:15.417 --> 31:17.250
I told you. Soon.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.708
Hey, I gotta go.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.667
Okay, bye.

31:23.750 --> 31:24.833
Bye.

31:49.792 --> 31:51.917
That's good, keep it up.

32:45.667 --> 32:46.833
What are you doing?

32:50.250 --> 32:51.708
I'm falling!

32:53.375 --> 32:54.833
Fucking cops!

32:56.583 --> 32:57.750
Why?

33:01.042 --> 33:02.333
Get back!

33:11.083 --> 33:12.167
Hi, Olga?

33:12.250 --> 33:13.125
Where are you?

33:13.208 --> 33:15.833
Maidan Square.
I can't talk right now!

33:15.917 --> 33:17.375
Mom, go home!

33:17.458 --> 33:19.708
Go home, you hear me?

33:25.875 --> 33:27.000
Are you okay, Olga?

33:27.375 --> 33:28.208
Yes.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.792
Around 3 am, the people
who were peacefully demonstrating,

33:49.875 --> 33:52.792
mainly students who had gathered
in Maidan Square,

33:52.875 --> 33:55.625
were violently dispersed by riot police

33:55.708 --> 33:58.708
who had been ordered
to clear up the square.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.208
Come on, get up!

34:03.292 --> 34:07.083
Nearly one hundred students
and journalists were arrested.

34:07.625 --> 34:11.083
Dozens of people suffered
serious injuries.

34:15.417 --> 34:16.833
What are you doing?

34:16.917 --> 34:20.000
The rallying call had been made
on social media.

34:20.083 --> 34:22.958
The protesters are contesting
the cancelation

34:23.042 --> 34:26.167
of the trade agreement
with the European Union

34:26.250 --> 34:28.333
by President Yanukovych.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.708
A cancelation that plays
into the hands of Russia.

34:32.792 --> 34:36.083
The protesters see
this trade agreement with Europe

34:36.167 --> 34:38.917
as the country's only hope for change.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.667
Shame on you!

34:41.208 --> 34:42.875
Shame on you!

34:47.542 --> 34:50.542
There you go, nice.
Good job, Olga.

34:51.208 --> 34:52.083
Watch your round-off.

34:52.167 --> 34:53.958
- Push with your arms.
- I know.

35:00.417 --> 35:04.500
Steffi, what are you doing?
That's terrible. You have no rhythm!

35:07.958 --> 35:09.750
Any news from home?

35:09.833 --> 35:11.750
- Wanna talk about it?
- No.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.708
There you go, great.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.125
Steffi, you wanna make the Euro?

35:34.208 --> 35:37.792
That's how I want your round-off.
In the axis, with some energy.

35:38.125 --> 35:39.667
Come on, switch apparatuses.

35:39.750 --> 35:41.167
No! I'll do it again.

35:41.250 --> 35:43.208
Switch. Go to the uneven bars.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.292
Awesome vibe, you guys.

36:14.917 --> 36:17.167
This girl's not normal.

36:18.958 --> 36:20.000
Look at her.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.000
She's a fucking robot.

36:22.333 --> 36:23.958
In French, per favore.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.375
Lazy bum.

36:32.167 --> 36:33.375
What did you say?

36:33.708 --> 36:36.792
Yeah, you.
Fuck you, you lazy bum.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.583
- Drop it, Steffi.
- Don't touch me.

36:45.708 --> 36:46.750
What did you say?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.000
You don't belong here.

36:51.917 --> 36:53.333
I'll fuck you up, bitch.

36:55.083 --> 36:56.750
- Calm down!
- Let go of her!

36:57.125 --> 36:58.292
Let her go!

37:00.333 --> 37:01.250
You got it?

37:02.500 --> 37:03.500
Asshole.

37:03.875 --> 37:06.375
Enough, Steffi, enough!

37:13.125 --> 37:15.542
Steffi, please, sit down.

37:16.375 --> 37:19.375
- What's going on here?
- You know exactly what's going on.

37:19.458 --> 37:22.042
You're the National Team captain.
We have a championship coming.

37:22.125 --> 37:24.167
What's with the fighting like children?

37:24.250 --> 37:27.958
Want me to tell the Federation
and sponsors to cancel the whole thing?

37:36.333 --> 37:38.208
Olga, can you please look at me?

37:40.375 --> 37:43.333
I skipped practice
so I could be with my brother!

37:43.417 --> 37:46.250
It's all good anyway,
I was selected for the Euro.

37:46.333 --> 37:49.917
Olga, can you hear this mess?

37:50.333 --> 37:53.542
Out with the thug!

37:53.625 --> 37:57.042
It's crazy what happened.
Everyone's in shock.

37:57.125 --> 37:59.917
Can you hear them?
Folks are coming from everywhere!

38:00.000 --> 38:02.708
I've never seen so many people.

38:04.958 --> 38:07.417
It's the revolution, Olga.

38:08.458 --> 38:11.167
Damn, I wish you were here.

38:17.500 --> 38:21.125
For shame! For shame!

38:25.250 --> 38:27.500
Out with Yanukovych!

38:31.750 --> 38:35.083
Get over here.
We're all going to Maidan.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.042
Praise Ukraine!

38:48.792 --> 38:51.125
Praise Maidan!

38:52.917 --> 38:56.042
All together: "Revolution

38:56.125 --> 38:58.500
of dignity!”

38:58.583 --> 39:04.625
- Revolution...
- Of dignity!

39:14.875 --> 39:17.250
Free Ukraine!

39:24.792 --> 39:26.875
Kiss Lenin goodbye!

39:28.333 --> 39:32.250
Revolution!

39:40.833 --> 39:41.917
You okay?

39:42.000 --> 39:42.958
I'm fine.

39:44.417 --> 39:46.000
Don't tell me you're scared.

39:46.917 --> 39:47.917
No.

39:48.917 --> 39:50.667
Don't worry, they won't bite.

40:00.708 --> 40:01.708
It's beautiful.

40:01.792 --> 40:05.667
It looks great on you. Make sure
you don't machine wash it, kharacho?

40:06.375 --> 40:07.625
Have a small glass.

40:07.708 --> 40:08.667
No, thanks.

40:08.750 --> 40:10.208
Come on, it's Christmas.

40:10.750 --> 40:11.583
No.

40:11.667 --> 40:14.125
Are you kidding, Bertrand?
She can't.

40:14.208 --> 40:15.708
Go give Dad a glass.

40:21.958 --> 40:23.042
There you are.

40:24.167 --> 40:25.667
I'm happy to see you.

40:29.042 --> 40:30.875
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.917
Use it to buy whatever you please.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Thank you.

40:41.958 --> 40:44.625
Here's your dad.
Nice picture, right?

40:44.708 --> 40:45.500
He's handsome.

40:48.042 --> 40:50.625
And this is a cousin...

40:50.708 --> 40:52.208
Dad, who is that?

40:52.292 --> 40:54.042
That was Alfred. Uncle Alfred.

40:54.125 --> 40:55.083
Was that Alfred?

40:57.667 --> 40:59.833
Look. That's him.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.875
Hey, look at that cutie.

41:04.167 --> 41:05.250
About 20.

41:05.333 --> 41:07.292
- Wow, 20 medals.
- Maybe even 21.

41:07.375 --> 41:09.417
Can I see that one, please?

41:10.083 --> 41:11.333
- Look.
- Thanks.

41:11.417 --> 41:13.792
Yep. She was on the podium.

41:15.583 --> 41:17.125
Who's that with my dad?

41:17.208 --> 41:20.417
That's Nadine. Right?
That's Nadine, isn't it?

41:20.500 --> 41:23.583
Yeah, that's Nadine.
She was your dad's first wife.

41:23.667 --> 41:26.000
I went to school with her.
That was before he met your mom.

41:26.083 --> 41:28.125
- And who is this?
- How come I don't know your mom?

41:29.625 --> 41:30.833
She's far away.

41:31.292 --> 41:32.250
Okay.

41:32.333 --> 41:33.667
Still.

41:34.125 --> 41:37.458
After everything that happened to you,
she could've come.

41:38.458 --> 41:39.750
It's true that...

41:39.833 --> 41:42.458
things are getting really dangerous
over there. In Kyiv.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.083
Why is it dangerous?

41:44.583 --> 41:45.958
There's a revolution.

41:46.042 --> 41:48.625
A "revolution,"
let's not get carried away.

41:48.708 --> 41:49.917
Then why is it dangerous?

41:50.000 --> 41:51.875
Because there's people
vandalizing everything.

41:51.958 --> 41:54.167
They're fighting and rioting.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.958
No, it's about freedom.

41:56.042 --> 41:59.083
Freedom, sure.
But it's confusing to us.

41:59.167 --> 42:01.292
Some of them wanna join
the European Union...

42:01.375 --> 42:03.208
The European Union? Big whoop.

42:03.292 --> 42:06.083
Not to mention hardcore nationalists,
they're super violent.

42:06.167 --> 42:08.458
You and your stupid theories.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.292
- Enough already, let her speak.
- I'm just explaining.

42:11.375 --> 42:12.875
She might wanna say something.

42:12.958 --> 42:14.458
Well, yeah, go ahead.

42:15.625 --> 42:18.500
Meanwhile, how convenient for her
to have us take care of her daughter.

42:19.875 --> 42:21.542
She's an irresponsible person.

42:21.625 --> 42:23.375
- Irresponsible?
- Dad, knock it off.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.875
Casually leaving her daughter
on her own?

42:25.958 --> 42:27.417
And you think that's okay?

42:27.500 --> 42:29.542
Don't talk about my mother.

42:29.625 --> 42:31.542
My mother's doing her job.

42:35.167 --> 42:36.000
Hello?

42:36.083 --> 42:36.917
Hey, Mom.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.292
How are you? Happy holidays!

42:39.875 --> 42:42.458
Why does Grandpa hate you so much?

42:42.542 --> 42:43.583
Grandpa?

42:45.208 --> 42:48.125
Your dad had only come to Kyiv
for his dissertation.

42:48.208 --> 42:51.750
But he ended up staying.
Grandpa never forgave me.

42:51.833 --> 42:52.958
I forgive you.

42:53.792 --> 42:56.333
I saw pictures of Dad.

42:57.542 --> 42:59.667
You're starting to look like him
more and more.

43:00.625 --> 43:02.333
Are you in Maidan?

43:02.417 --> 43:03.958
Yeah, in the press section.

43:04.042 --> 43:06.500
You must be happy,
they're keeping you busy.

43:06.833 --> 43:09.708
Well, yeah,
and that's only the beginning.

43:09.792 --> 43:11.292
I can imagine.

43:11.708 --> 43:14.333
What about you? Everything good?

43:14.417 --> 43:16.833
I'm getting ready for the Euro.

43:16.917 --> 43:20.292
I'm working on my Jaeger.
It's still not looking great.

43:20.375 --> 43:22.083
- Be right there.
- I would need another month.

43:22.167 --> 43:23.917
Ilona, hurry. Things are moving!

43:24.000 --> 43:26.375
I have to go. I'll call you back.

43:26.458 --> 43:29.500
Are you serious?
We barely started talking.

43:29.583 --> 43:31.500
Hey, watch your tone.

43:31.583 --> 43:32.917
You don't give a shit about me!

43:33.000 --> 43:36.292
People are getting beat up
and you just want me to sit there?

43:36.375 --> 43:37.667
Fuck you!

43:45.833 --> 43:49.792
Police attempted a break
as recently as this evening.

43:50.125 --> 43:52.708
But the barricades held still.

43:53.958 --> 43:57.917
Volunteers continue to flock
from all around the country.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.042
People have been camping here
for a month.

44:01.125 --> 44:04.583
They've organized so as to maintain
control of the square.

44:07.583 --> 44:10.375
Ukrainians are demanding
a true democracy.

44:10.458 --> 44:14.208
They will only get it
if the President steps down

44:14.292 --> 44:17.500
and corrupt institutions
are cleaned up.

44:17.583 --> 44:21.333
And they will remain there
no matter what.

44:24.542 --> 44:26.500
Retreat to the square!

44:29.208 --> 44:30.292
Quick!

44:36.083 --> 44:39.125
Olga, the entire future of Ukraine
is at stake.

44:39.208 --> 44:40.958
You need to understand.

44:41.042 --> 44:44.083
This is your country,
whether you like it or not.

44:46.958 --> 44:51.000
I mailed your application.
Do whatever you want.

44:51.083 --> 44:52.292
But please pick up.

44:57.792 --> 44:59.417
Olga, answer me!

46:20.958 --> 46:24.333
What are you doing, proofreading?
Spell-checking?

46:24.875 --> 46:26.583
You don't need to read it, it's fine.

46:26.667 --> 46:27.458
Okay?

46:30.708 --> 46:31.542
Just sign.

46:37.708 --> 46:39.625
Welcome to the Swiss National Team.

46:39.708 --> 46:40.625
You're welcome.

46:47.792 --> 46:49.208
Hey, easy.

47:00.125 --> 47:01.292
Come on, girls.

47:01.667 --> 47:03.125
It is what it is.

47:04.083 --> 47:07.542
There'll be other selections.
Let's stay focused. Come on.

47:10.583 --> 47:13.167
She definitely got her feet wet.

47:13.750 --> 47:15.708
That's good for the team, is it not?

47:18.375 --> 47:19.708
Just fantastic.

47:24.458 --> 47:27.375
Zoé, your floor diagonal
isn't good enough.

47:27.458 --> 47:30.042
We couldn't select you.
But you have this gala...

47:30.125 --> 47:31.375
Please.

47:44.917 --> 47:48.000
Hey, just go to the beam.
There's nothing you can do.

48:19.583 --> 48:20.667
Fuck!

49:15.542 --> 49:18.125
Use your heels when you jump.

49:22.417 --> 49:23.583
Come on.

49:59.375 --> 50:00.333
Come on.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.458
<i>Come on, Zoe!</i>

50:27.167 --> 50:28.833
Go all the way.

50:48.875 --> 50:50.417
<i>Come on, Zoe!</i>

51:13.500 --> 51:14.292
Zoe?

51:16.458 --> 51:17.750
What the hell is wrong with you?

51:17.833 --> 51:18.958
Sorry.

51:19.917 --> 51:20.708
No!

51:47.125 --> 51:49.000
Come on, Zoé, help me.

52:09.208 --> 52:10.000
Go ahead.

52:10.833 --> 52:11.833
Come on.

52:22.958 --> 52:23.792
Zoe!

52:24.667 --> 52:27.708
Are you okay? Zoé, are you okay?

52:30.917 --> 52:32.542
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

52:42.417 --> 52:43.500
No harm done?

52:50.542 --> 52:54.250
I don't belong here anymore.
I'm done.

52:55.667 --> 52:58.625
I'll be close-by, Olga.
Will you come see me?

53:30.792 --> 53:31.792
Is there a problem?

53:32.792 --> 53:33.750
What did you give him?

53:33.833 --> 53:35.625
<i>Her visa's expired.
Do we take her in or...?</i>

53:35.708 --> 53:37.083
I made a mistake.

53:37.167 --> 53:38.333
That's okay.

53:58.917 --> 53:59.958
I'll be right there.

54:11.083 --> 54:12.583
Mom, check this out.

54:14.292 --> 54:15.500
This is crazy.

54:17.125 --> 54:19.208
That's where it all goes down tomorrow.

54:19.792 --> 54:21.333
And I promise...

54:21.875 --> 54:23.833
we're gonna win for sure.

54:27.667 --> 54:29.417
Who's the boss, eh?

54:29.500 --> 54:30.875
Sasha?

54:31.583 --> 54:33.542
- Hi, bitch.
- Hi!

54:33.625 --> 54:34.458
What's up, chica?

54:34.792 --> 54:36.500
We finally made it to the Euro.

54:36.583 --> 54:37.875
Hey, Olga!

54:37.958 --> 54:38.792
Hey!

54:38.875 --> 54:39.875
My girls.

54:41.125 --> 54:42.917
Watch out, you're turning red.

54:43.292 --> 54:44.708
Shut up, you idiot.

54:44.792 --> 54:46.417
Still, it looks weird.

54:46.500 --> 54:47.333
Stop it.

54:47.417 --> 54:48.417
When did you get here?

54:48.500 --> 54:52.042
In the middle of the night.
We got stuck at the border in Kyiv.

54:52.125 --> 54:53.042
Forget it.

54:53.125 --> 54:55.875
What did you do to your hair?
You look like a dude.

54:55.958 --> 54:58.333
That way, nobody gives me shit
on the barricades.

54:59.375 --> 55:00.417
Sasha!

55:00.500 --> 55:02.167
Practice!

55:03.458 --> 55:04.583
She's a pain in the ass.

55:05.042 --> 55:07.125
Anyway, let's link later, okay?

55:07.208 --> 55:08.042
Sure.

55:08.667 --> 55:11.500
What's wrong with you?
Go practice.

55:16.042 --> 55:17.333
Good. Excellent.

55:17.417 --> 55:19.500
Tanya, your turn.

55:21.958 --> 55:26.083
Yanukovych is trying to screw us
with his new laws.

55:26.750 --> 55:29.125
The cops can arrest you for anything,

55:29.208 --> 55:32.625
even if you're just holding a helmet.

55:32.708 --> 55:33.708
That's insane.

55:33.792 --> 55:35.667
So instead of helmets,

55:35.750 --> 55:38.250
people are wearing pans.

55:38.333 --> 55:40.333
Can you imagine?

55:40.417 --> 55:42.625
I can totally see you
with a pan on your head.

55:43.042 --> 55:45.875
The second you step foot in Maidan,

55:45.958 --> 55:50.042
it's like an instant rush.

55:50.917 --> 55:53.500
I can't even explain.

55:53.583 --> 55:56.583
You're always needed for something,

55:56.667 --> 55:59.250
whether it's handing out
tea or medicine,

55:59.333 --> 56:01.958
blankets, and so on.

56:02.042 --> 56:05.000
I put a tent back up
that the cops had taken down.

56:05.417 --> 56:08.000
I mean,
can you picture me doing all that?

56:09.875 --> 56:13.542
My brother doesn't want me
to go anymore.

56:13.625 --> 56:16.417
He says it's too risky or what not.

56:16.500 --> 56:19.292
I don't care, I'm gonna go back.

56:19.375 --> 56:20.500
Hold on.

56:29.708 --> 56:31.708
When we sing at night,

56:31.792 --> 56:33.708
everyone turns on

56:33.792 --> 56:36.375
the flashlights on their phones.

56:36.458 --> 56:39.375
The square
and all the streets around it

56:39.458 --> 56:42.667
just light up.

56:42.750 --> 56:44.583
Like in a fairytale.

56:47.833 --> 56:52.000
When we return, brother

56:53.833 --> 56:56.083
We shall govern

56:56.167 --> 56:59.667
Our nation

57:00.208 --> 57:03.208
For our freedom

57:03.292 --> 57:06.417
We shall give

57:06.500 --> 57:08.625
Our souls

57:08.708 --> 57:12.125
And our bodies

57:12.208 --> 57:15.292
We shall prove

57:15.375 --> 57:18.542
Brother

57:18.625 --> 57:21.375
That we are the descendants

57:21.458 --> 57:24.542
Of the Cossacks

57:24.625 --> 57:27.625
For our freedom

57:27.708 --> 57:31.333
We shall give

57:31.417 --> 57:34.917
Our souls and our bodies

57:35.250 --> 57:38.833
After the tournament,
I'm putting you in my suitcase, okay?

57:49.125 --> 57:51.250
Sasha, look. That's Vastly!

57:54.083 --> 57:55.000
What's wrong with you?

57:55.083 --> 57:58.375
Let him stay in Russia,
if he likes it so much.

57:58.458 --> 57:59.292
Stop it.

57:59.792 --> 58:02.625
Anyway, let's beat the shit
out of them tomorrow, okay?

58:02.708 --> 58:05.542
Olga. Come on, hurry up.

58:05.625 --> 58:07.000
I'm gonna get in trouble.

58:07.083 --> 58:08.000
Good luck.

58:27.625 --> 58:29.833
We're a good team now.

58:32.375 --> 58:34.875
Juliette as an alternate, that's a pity.

58:35.917 --> 58:37.667
She's better than Vivienne.

58:39.208 --> 58:40.417
You and me,

58:40.500 --> 58:43.292
we can get enough points tomorrow.

58:46.792 --> 58:48.708
Andrea is nervous.

58:49.583 --> 58:52.792
You need to talk to her
before her start.

58:56.417 --> 58:59.208
I'm not ready for the final stretch
of my floor exercise.

58:59.667 --> 59:01.292
I can't do it.

59:01.375 --> 59:04.375
Yes, you can.
I've seen you do it before.

59:05.333 --> 59:06.792
You're really good.

59:08.375 --> 59:09.458
Tomorrow...

59:13.083 --> 59:15.625
we can't be afraid, okay?

59:17.167 --> 59:18.167
Okay.

59:31.333 --> 59:33.375
Hold them back!

59:52.333 --> 59:54.167
Get down!

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:32.583
Damn, what time is it?

01:00:32.667 --> 01:00:33.917
Olga, open up!

01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:36.333
Olga!

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:37.625
Olga.

01:00:39.167 --> 01:00:40.000
Sasha?

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:42.167
- You need to see this.
- What are you doing here?

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.458
- It's your mother.
- Mom?

01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:45.083
Things got out of hand tonight.

01:00:45.167 --> 01:00:46.292
Show me!

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:50.417
Where are you taking her?

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.500
To Central Hospital.

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:53.750
What the hell are you doing?

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.708
Did she say something?

01:00:57.792 --> 01:01:00.375
We need to call the hospital.

01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:05.125
It's llona Budiashkina, the journalist.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.167
Didn't she say anything?

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.917
Come on, call the hospital.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.792
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:20.875 --> 01:01:22.333
Network overload.

01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:24.792
Try again.

01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:29.583
Just answer me this, please.

01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:32.125
Just tell me how she's doing!

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:34.375
I'm unable to come,
don't you understand?

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:37.750
I can't!
She's my mother, just answer me.

01:01:38.125 --> 01:01:40.417
I just wanna know how she's doing.

01:01:42.208 --> 01:01:44.458
I would come if I could,

01:01:44.542 --> 01:01:47.167
but I can't, that's impossible.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:49.750
Please, I'm begging you.

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:54.000
Please.

01:02:04.875 --> 01:02:07.917
Good evening, everyone, and welcome!

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:13.250
Thank you for being with us!

01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:27.542
A total of 210 athletes

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:31.333
from 34 countries are about
to enter the arena.

01:02:31.417 --> 01:02:34.542
All are hoping to give their very best

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:36.750
and to possibly take home

01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:39.958
the title of European Champion.

01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:48.792
Olga.

01:02:50.417 --> 01:02:51.417
I'll be right there.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.083
Olenka.

01:02:53.792 --> 01:02:55.042
I'm so sorry.

01:02:55.708 --> 01:02:57.917
I saw what happened to your mom.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.625
Don't ever talk to me again.

01:03:00.083 --> 01:03:01.292
What's the matter?

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:07.917
Why are you saying that?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.958
You chose your side.

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:12.917
This is sports, not politics.

01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:16.375
Don't fuck it up.

01:03:20.458 --> 01:03:21.708
On the beam,

01:03:21.792 --> 01:03:25.292
Candela Gomez from Spain,
who had medaled in 2012.

01:03:25.958 --> 01:03:27.750
Beautiful!

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.083
On the vault,
Sophie Chatelain for France.

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.792
Good luck!

01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:57.250
12.7 for the Frenchwoman.

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.958
If you're not feeling it,
Juliette can do it.

01:04:00.042 --> 01:04:01.292
No, I'm fine.

01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:26.292
What a pity for Julia.

01:04:27.042 --> 01:04:29.708
As we await Gabelgaard's result
on the beam...

01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:18.958
Come on, come on!

01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:35.375
Hey, stop. Stay here.

01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:48.083
Calm down! Stop it!

01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:53.333
Stop. If you move, you're out.

01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:57.833
Olga, don't let them push us around!

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:04.667
Our apologies
for this unforeseen incident.

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:09.208
Yes... the competition
is about to resume...

01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:10.667
Okay. Porsche-Arena,

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:12.792
let's hear it, everyone!

01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:31.708
<i>She's the reigning champion
from last year's individual event.</i>

01:07:15.792 --> 01:07:16.917
Come on, let's go.

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:20.000
Come on.

01:08:54.582 --> 01:08:55.750
Olga?

01:08:57.792 --> 01:08:59.000
It's your mother.

01:08:59.542 --> 01:09:00.542
Hello?

01:09:01.167 --> 01:09:02.207
Mom?

01:09:03.082 --> 01:09:04.667
Mom, can you hear me?

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:07.417
Are you there?

01:09:08.582 --> 01:09:09.750
It's not working.

01:09:09.832 --> 01:09:11.457
What do you mean, it's not working?

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:13.582
Hello?

01:09:28.125 --> 01:09:29.457
Mom, show yourself.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:32.250
No camera, okay?

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:34.417
No, with it.

01:09:35.417 --> 01:09:39.042
Don't worry, I'm safe here.

01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:42.667
You weren't answering.
What do you mean, you're safe?

01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:44.332
How are you? I wanna see you.

01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:47.917
I saw the footage...
of your performance in the Euro.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.332
No, let's not talk about that.

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:51.457
Show yourself.

01:09:51.542 --> 01:09:54.833
I haven't seen or heard you
for too long.

01:09:54.917 --> 01:09:56.625
Don't be afraid. Okay?

01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:57.792
Okay.

01:09:58.458 --> 01:10:00.083
I don't look so good.

01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:02.208
Come on, show yourself, please.

01:10:14.292 --> 01:10:15.750
I can't believe it.

01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:26.875
Don't cry.

01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:30.042
Are you in pain?

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.583
No, I'm okay.

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:33.792
Everything's fine, I told you.

01:10:35.375 --> 01:10:36.875
Who did this to you?

01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:41.208
This was meant to happen,
since nothing ever changes around here.

01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:43.083
I'm gonna come home.

01:10:43.167 --> 01:10:44.667
I forbid you.

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.125
I need to be with you.

01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:48.792
Not now. I'm begging you.

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:49.708
When?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.333
Take a look, Olga.

01:12:14.417 --> 01:12:17.292
You see this line on your metatarsal?

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.042
That's a stress fracture.

01:12:24.417 --> 01:12:27.458
You must've compounded the impacts
for some time.

01:12:28.292 --> 01:12:29.542
How long have you been hurting?

01:12:32.167 --> 01:12:33.333
Why didn't you say so?

01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:36.083
I don't know.

01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:38.833
Do you remember a fall
or feeling a snap?

01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:41.000
No.

01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:48.208
Well, I can't give you an opinion
on the Olympic test event.

01:12:48.292 --> 01:12:51.167
I'm not ruling it out,
but we'll have to see how things evolve.

01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:54.958
Olga, this is your body
laying its boundaries.

01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:56.792
I don't want you to move at all.

01:12:57.292 --> 01:12:59.542
If it worsens,
you can kiss gymnastics goodbye.

01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:28.375
You okay?

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:44.792
There you go. That was great.
Chin up. Nice.

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:47.208
There you go, Andrea.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.250
A cop on Hrushevsky Street.

01:13:57.042 --> 01:13:59.292
It's all burned down over there.

01:14:00.333 --> 01:14:03.292
There was a girl next to me.

01:14:04.125 --> 01:14:06.583
And right in front of her,

01:14:07.417 --> 01:14:08.917
a grenade went off.

01:14:10.375 --> 01:14:11.958
I freaked out.

01:14:12.042 --> 01:14:15.542
So I threw my Molotov cocktail.

01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:18.833
On the cop.

01:14:23.958 --> 01:14:25.792
His whole body caught fire.

01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:32.208
People around me were yelling,

01:14:32.292 --> 01:14:34.625
"Praise Ukraine! Praise the heroes!"

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.375
And he just...

01:14:38.667 --> 01:14:39.792
fell.

01:14:40.917 --> 01:14:42.792
And what did you do?

01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:47.125
I ran away.

01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:49.917
Like a chicken.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.333
It was self-defense, that's all.

01:14:54.917 --> 01:14:56.750
That other girl could've been you.

01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:59.167
He got what he deserved.

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:01.458
This is going too far,

01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:03.708
I won't be going back.

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:06.375
You can't give up.

01:15:06.792 --> 01:15:08.208
You're not gonna give up, are you?

01:15:08.292 --> 01:15:10.708
Olga, you don't understand
what it's like over here.

01:15:10.792 --> 01:15:13.875
After what they did to my mom?

01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:16.875
You think it only happened to her?

01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:19.667
Don't throw in the towel,
you just can't.

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:22.000
No, Olga, I'm here every day.

01:15:22.083 --> 01:15:24.375
People are dying, don't you get it?

01:15:24.458 --> 01:15:27.833
People are dying every day.

01:15:28.208 --> 01:15:29.750
It's horrible, Olga.

01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:32.417
I don't know why I keep talking to you.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.208
You're sitting
in your nice, comfy room.

01:15:34.292 --> 01:15:36.792
You know full well
I didn't choose to be here.

01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:38.958
You know I wanna be with you guys.

01:15:39.042 --> 01:15:41.792
That's bullshit. Fuck you!

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:03.958
Olga?

01:17:04.042 --> 01:17:05.375
I need help.

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.583
- What?
- I need your help, Zoé.

01:17:07.667 --> 01:17:09.333
Hold on, come over here.

01:17:14.833 --> 01:17:16.917
I need to go to the airport.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.375
What do you mean, the airport?

01:17:18.917 --> 01:17:21.958
I can't go on my own, it's too far.

01:17:22.042 --> 01:17:24.083
I need to go back to Kyiv.

01:17:24.167 --> 01:17:27.083
But Olga, they won't let you go.

01:17:27.167 --> 01:17:28.792
You're a minor,
they won't let you through.

01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:31.333
They will!
They will let me through.

01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:33.083
I'll explain it to them, Zoe.

01:17:33.167 --> 01:17:35.333
No, that's not possible.
Let me drive you back to...

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.750
No, I have to go! Please.

01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:42.292
You're the only one who can help me.

01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:45.458
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.

01:17:48.667 --> 01:17:49.542
Please.

01:17:49.625 --> 01:17:52.792
No, Olga.
Can't you see it's useless?

01:18:05.583 --> 01:18:06.667
Thank you so much.

01:18:11.042 --> 01:18:13.333
What were you thinking,
trying to leave like that?

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:17.875
Do you really think
that's the best solution

01:18:18.625 --> 01:18:20.125
to help your country?

01:18:21.458 --> 01:18:23.667
You'll ruin your feet with this shit.

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:25.958
Get some rest.

01:18:26.833 --> 01:18:29.167
And then, do what you do best.

01:18:29.917 --> 01:18:33.083
Train, prepare for the Olympics.
That's something positive.

01:18:34.667 --> 01:18:36.625
Your mom and I spoke on the phone.

01:18:37.917 --> 01:18:40.375
She's proud of you. So proud.

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:44.500
Olga, here's what we're gonna do.

01:18:45.292 --> 01:18:46.458
You're gonna get treatment.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.208
Then we'll train intensely.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.083
Together.

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:53.375
And you'll go to the Olympics.

01:18:55.292 --> 01:18:56.500
Let's not do that again.

01:19:12.792 --> 01:19:15.042
Guys, we need help!

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:16.750
Check this out over there.

01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:20.000
These are snipers.

01:19:34.917 --> 01:19:37.667
Did you see what happened?

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:40.000
How is that possible, Olga?

01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:44.750
Did you see?
They fired at the crowd.

01:19:45.583 --> 01:19:47.917
What's gonna become of us, Olga?

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:58.167
There were so many deaths

01:22:58.250 --> 01:23:00.583
that Yanukovych fled to Russia.

01:23:01.625 --> 01:23:03.667
And by the time I got home,

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:07.083
the war broke out in the East
and Crimea was invaded.

01:23:07.958 --> 01:23:11.000
We would learn to live with it.

01:23:13.333 --> 01:23:15.458
I saw the ruins in Maidan

01:23:15.917 --> 01:23:19.792
and just like everyone else,
I wondered,

01:23:20.875 --> 01:23:22.542
"How am I gonna deal with all this?"

01:23:48.417 --> 01:23:50.958
Up next, Polina,
a first-year student in Group B.

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:53.000
Get in position.

01:23:54.792 --> 01:23:55.875
You'll be fine.

01:23:58.375 --> 01:23:59.958
Go ahead.

Don't be scared, Diana. It's okay.

01:24:16.708 --> 01:24:18.750
Concentrate.
Let your hands go all the way.

01:24:21.792 --> 01:24:23.625
Come on, let your hands go all the way.

01:24:24.958 --> 01:24:26.042
