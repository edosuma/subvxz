00:12.346 --> 00:13.466
Good morning, guys.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.181
Good morning.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.434
Have you heard of Batman?

00:18.435 --> 00:19.445
Yes.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.150
Just checking and just kidding.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.896
Of course you've
heard of Batman.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.357
So I have had the honor

00:24.358 --> 00:26.737
of getting invited to
speak all over the world

00:26.738 --> 00:29.275
to tell the story that
you're about to hear.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.339
And everywhere I go,

00:30.340 --> 00:32.198
whether it's Tanzania in Africa

00:32.198 --> 00:33.829
or Chile in South America

00:33.830 --> 00:35.485
or Hong Kong or Thailand

00:35.494 --> 00:37.163
or the United Arab Emirates,

00:37.164 --> 00:39.541
everywhere I go,
I show that symbol,

00:39.542 --> 00:40.870
and I have not been to a school

00:40.874 --> 00:44.340
anywhere in the world where
someone doesn't know it.

00:44.341 --> 00:46.876
Now don't worry if you're
not interested in superheroes

00:46.880 --> 00:49.090
because I've done
this many times,

00:49.091 --> 00:52.138
and I can guarantee everyone
here, including staff,

00:52.139 --> 00:54.845
that you will walk out
of this room in an hour

00:54.846 --> 00:56.305
with a different perspective

00:56.306 --> 00:59.176
than you have right now,
I guarantee it.

00:59.184 --> 01:03.604
On every Batman story
since the first in 1939,

01:03.605 --> 01:06.395
there was only one name
in the credit line.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.819
"Batman created by Bob Kane."

01:09.820 --> 01:11.946
Here he is.

01:11.947 --> 01:16.867
And here's the thing
about that credit line:

01:16.868 --> 01:20.828
It is not true.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.560
The reason I do explain why

01:42.561 --> 01:44.331
that I like superheroes
is a little bit pat,

01:44.332 --> 01:46.059
and it maybe is a
little bit disingenuous

01:46.064 --> 01:48.654
because I wasn't thinking
like this as a kid.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.741
But I do like stories
of selflessness

01:54.742 --> 01:56.740
and I like stories of sacrifice,

01:56.742 --> 02:01.746
and superheroes sacrifice
something on a daily basis.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.418
Superheroes are not doing this

02:08.419 --> 02:11.339
to get paid or praised,
and it is not about them.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.549
They are doing something
for the greater good,

02:13.550 --> 02:15.840
then they disappear
into the night.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.890
The notion of that is
so rare in real life.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.351
I mean, we know so few people

02:23.352 --> 02:26.020
that can afford to be selfless.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.654
As a six-year-old,
I wasn't thinking like that,

02:31.655 --> 02:34.111
even as a 12- or 15-year-old.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.279
I just liked a good story,

02:35.280 --> 02:36.570
a good adventure,
and I still do,

02:36.573 --> 02:38.833
so it was a combination
of those things,

02:38.834 --> 02:40.655
this purity of purpose

02:40.661 --> 02:43.704
and then just a
great cliff-hanging,

02:43.705 --> 02:45.955
rollicking adventure.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.942
Here is the Batman section.

03:12.943 --> 03:17.196
One, two, three, four
full... almost full shelves.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.327
And compare that to Superman.

03:21.827 --> 03:22.947
Not knocking Superman,

03:22.953 --> 03:25.246
but just looking at the reality.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.915
Here's Superman
up to about there.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.335
Batman is not only
the most identifiable

03:31.336 --> 03:32.916
and recognizable and famous

03:32.921 --> 03:34.008
and beloved superhero,

03:34.009 --> 03:36.465
but he is one of
the most recognizable

03:36.466 --> 03:38.175
fictional characters
of all time.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.716
Can take almost any
Batman book off the shelf

03:40.720 --> 03:44.680
and open to the title page.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.892
"Batman created by Bob Kane."

03:50.939 --> 03:53.979
Bob, for the few people who
come from another planet,

03:53.984 --> 03:55.864
who may not know what you do,

03:55.865 --> 03:58.154
what is it that
you're known for?

03:58.155 --> 03:59.275
You've got to be kidding.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.865
I am, of course.

04:00.866 --> 04:04.034
Bob Kane is the original
cartoonist of Batman

04:04.035 --> 04:06.365
and the man who has
been credited on Batman

04:06.371 --> 04:08.168
for most of Batman's history.

04:08.169 --> 04:09.825
When I was 18, I tripped across

04:09.833 --> 04:11.252
a character called Batman.

04:11.253 --> 04:12.641
Bat... how do you pronounce that?

04:12.644 --> 04:15.212
- Batman?
- B-A-T-man.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.632
It was called
"Batman by Robert Kane."

04:17.634 --> 04:21.594
In 1938, two gangly kids

04:21.595 --> 04:23.045
from Cleveland, Ohio

04:23.054 --> 04:26.307
sold an idea for a
character named Superman.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.888
Superman was a huge
influence on Bob Kane,

04:28.894 --> 04:32.062
not the creative side,
the financial side.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.898
So I thought of, yeah,

04:33.899 --> 04:35.818
"How much money is
Siegel and Shuster making?"

04:35.819 --> 04:38.027
They were the
creators of Superman.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.448
And in those days, in '39,

04:39.449 --> 04:42.236
they were making
$800 apiece a week.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.867
When Bob Kane found
out how much money

04:44.868 --> 04:47.658
the Superman creators were
making on a weekly basis

04:47.662 --> 04:49.580
which was $800 at the time,

04:49.581 --> 04:51.290
he went to an
editor at <i>National.</i>

04:51.291 --> 04:54.919
He said, "Listen, Bob, can
you do another superhero?"

04:54.920 --> 04:56.290
I said, "For that kind of money",

04:56.291 --> 04:57.354
you'll have it on Monday."

04:57.355 --> 04:59.264
For that kind of money,
you'd be the superhero.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.345
Boy, you better believe it.

05:00.350 --> 05:02.927
I'll steal it somewhere.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.807
And I went home,
and lo and behold

05:04.808 --> 05:07.014
I thought about all
my childhood heroes

05:07.015 --> 05:10.135
when I was a kid and
my world of fantasy.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.443
And on Monday, I came up with

05:11.444 --> 05:14.266
a very crude drawing of Batman.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.322
And the rest is
history that Batman...

05:16.323 --> 05:19.396
Batman is my claim to infamy.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.790
Well, like most adults
that like superheroes,

05:27.791 --> 05:29.576
my interest started
when I was a kid.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.119
I just never outgrew it.

05:31.122 --> 05:35.125
And that began a passion
that I had most of my life.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.476
I had a little
gap in adolescence

05:36.478 --> 05:39.048
when I had to distance
myself from things

05:39.049 --> 05:42.337
that could get in the
way of girls and life,

05:42.342 --> 05:43.842
but for the most
part, I've stuck

05:43.844 --> 05:46.512
with superheroes my whole life.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.101
I am an author of
books for young people,

05:49.102 --> 05:51.228
and some of them are
books for all ages.

05:51.229 --> 05:53.136
And I've written about 75 books.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.813
This is my first-ever book.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.690
<i>The Felix Activity Book.</i>

05:57.691 --> 06:01.151
Tour de force, I'm sure you
remember it well from 1996.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.281
And then here's the epic sequel,

06:03.282 --> 06:04.908
<i>Felix Explores our World.</i>

06:04.909 --> 06:07.236
I think the recurring
theme of my nonfiction

06:07.242 --> 06:09.492
is untold stories.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.703
<i>Boys of Steel.</i>

06:10.704 --> 06:13.464
Biography of Jerry
Siegel and Joe Shuster,

06:13.465 --> 06:15.165
creators of Superman.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.126
There are sometimes
tragic stories

06:17.127 --> 06:19.336
behind these iconic characters.

06:19.337 --> 06:24.007
Marc loves to bring out
the story behind a story,

06:24.009 --> 06:25.839
so he goes deep,

06:25.844 --> 06:27.894
and he's also very
persistent also

06:27.895 --> 06:29.555
as a human being.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.456
You got two toothpastes
because you didn't know

06:31.457 --> 06:32.677
if I wanted fluoride or not?

06:32.684 --> 06:34.900
- Yeah.
- Because they just announced

06:34.901 --> 06:36.185
that fluoride is a toxin now.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.396
I know that.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.397
I told you all along.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.107
It's in the water,
it's in the toothpaste.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.858
No, I know it's there,
but that doesn't mean

06:41.859 --> 06:43.697
- it's a toxin.
- Oh, you're filming us?

06:43.698 --> 06:45.235
I definitely feel sometimes

06:45.238 --> 06:46.868
that I'm not only
married to a writer,

06:46.869 --> 06:50.485
but also even
more so a detective.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.873
When I decided to write a book

06:51.874 --> 06:55.414
on the story behind Batman,
it hadn't been done yet.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.035
Whenever you start
a research project,

06:57.042 --> 06:58.876
you can't possibly know how much

06:58.877 --> 07:00.307
or how little
you're going to find.

07:00.311 --> 07:03.009
In this case, I was going
into the Batman book

07:03.010 --> 07:04.626
knowing that there were secrets

07:04.633 --> 07:06.592
that hadn't been
widely discussed,

07:06.593 --> 07:11.639
but I had no way to know it
was a lot more than that.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.640
So this story, for me,

07:12.641 --> 07:16.268
was uncovering a
big superhero secret

07:16.269 --> 07:20.019
that should have been
blown wide decades ago.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.570
In New York in 1965,

07:26.571 --> 07:28.618
was the first
official Comic Con,

07:28.619 --> 07:31.075
and the reason that
this is considered

07:31.076 --> 07:32.696
the first official Comic Con

07:32.702 --> 07:34.121
is because it was the first time

07:34.122 --> 07:35.540
that professionals showed up,

07:35.541 --> 07:38.118
not just fans in
a hotel basement

07:38.124 --> 07:39.708
with some back issues.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.336
This was historic,
this was a big deal.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.657
They didn't know it at the time,

07:43.663 --> 07:44.803
but it was a big deal.

07:44.804 --> 07:47.588
There were 200 of us
at that Comic Con.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.887
And this place was so sketchy.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.847
And we got there,
and my mother freaked

07:53.848 --> 07:55.598
when she saw where we were.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.188
There was literally
a guy drunk, unconscious

07:58.189 --> 07:59.645
on the floor in the lobby,

07:59.646 --> 08:02.016
and roaches on the walls,
and she just said,

08:02.023 --> 08:03.423
"We're out of here,
we're leaving."

08:03.424 --> 08:05.106
The hotel itself,
a few months later,

08:05.110 --> 08:06.988
actually, much of it collapsed.

08:06.989 --> 08:09.526
Luckily, it didn't do so
while we were in there,

08:09.531 --> 08:11.281
but none of us was
particularly surprised

08:11.282 --> 08:13.452
to hear that the Broadway
Central had collapsed.

08:13.453 --> 08:16.537
My mom finally said,
"Okay, we'll stay,"

08:16.538 --> 08:18.618
and you can go up to this
comic book convention,

08:18.623 --> 08:20.499
"but don't touch anything."

08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
And as we went through the bar,

08:22.502 --> 08:24.799
we saw Otto Binder
sitting there at the bar

08:24.800 --> 08:26.206
with another guy drinking.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.093
And we go in and we sit
down on the stools.

08:29.094 --> 08:31.342
And he goes, "What are
you boys drinking?"

08:31.344 --> 08:33.386
We ordered our Cokes.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.806
And Otto turns to me and Bob,

08:35.807 --> 08:38.636
he said, "Boys, how
would you like to meet"

08:38.643 --> 08:40.811
the creator of Batman?"

08:40.812 --> 08:42.730
And, like, our jaws dropped,

08:42.731 --> 08:46.150
our eyes had to be wide open,

08:46.151 --> 08:50.988
and we figured we were
going to meet Bob Kane,

08:50.989 --> 08:52.819
which was the only
name we ever saw

08:52.824 --> 08:54.834
on a comic book, it
was always in a box

08:54.835 --> 08:58.495
with a big "O" for Bob.

08:58.496 --> 09:02.956
And Otto said, "Fellas,
meet Bill Finger."

09:07.172 --> 09:09.131
So in 1965 at this Comic Con,

09:09.132 --> 09:10.510
in this dingy hotel in New York,

09:10.511 --> 09:12.588
Bill Finger made what
is probably his first

09:12.594 --> 09:14.641
and maybe his only
public appearance,

09:14.642 --> 09:16.007
and he appeared on a panel

09:16.014 --> 09:17.814
with three other
comics' creators.

09:17.815 --> 09:21.185
At this panel,
Bill was introduced

09:21.186 --> 09:23.686
by the moderator whose
name was Jerry Bails.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.106
And perhaps we'll hear some...

09:34.107 --> 09:37.657
Jerry was the fan,
who in 1964 or so,

09:37.660 --> 09:39.450
figured out that it could not be

09:39.454 --> 09:42.674
just this one guy, Bob Kane,
writing and drawing

09:42.675 --> 09:45.535
every Batman story every month.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.881
So Jerry did some
detective work of his own.

09:47.882 --> 09:50.047
He wrote letters
to DC Comics saying,

09:50.048 --> 09:51.216
"Who's really doing all this?"

09:51.217 --> 09:52.966
And in those days, companies
would write you back

09:52.967 --> 09:54.007
with a personal letter.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.890
And the name that he saw
more than any other

09:55.891 --> 09:57.467
was Bill Finger.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.367
So in 1965, Jerry wrote
a two-page article

10:22.372 --> 10:24.251
which was called
"If the Truth Be Known,".

10:24.252 --> 10:25.666
"A Finger in Every Plot!"

10:25.667 --> 10:27.537
And this was obviously
way before the internet,

10:27.544 --> 10:29.545
so his way of spreading the word

10:29.546 --> 10:31.266
was he made copies of
this and sent it out

10:31.272 --> 10:33.302
to Batman fans all
over the country.

10:33.303 --> 10:36.589
And that's when...

10:36.594 --> 10:38.554
the controversy erupted.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.925
Bill was given a forum
to tell his story

10:41.933 --> 10:43.853
where we could
finally become familiar

10:43.854 --> 10:45.439
with all these
characters and books

10:45.440 --> 10:47.226
that he wrote over the decades.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.939
It was the first thing
that, in writing,

10:48.940 --> 10:50.819
really gave Bill Finger credit

10:50.820 --> 10:52.567
for the co-creation of Batman,

10:52.569 --> 10:55.487
and it was about time.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.536
That fateful Friday in 1939

11:02.537 --> 11:04.617
when Bob told his editor

11:04.622 --> 11:06.707
that he would be able to
come up with a superhero

11:06.708 --> 11:07.708
over the weekend,

11:07.709 --> 11:09.128
he apparently did
go home that day

11:09.129 --> 11:12.006
and work on a character
which he called "Batman."

11:12.007 --> 11:14.295
Bob's idea for Batman
was a character

11:14.299 --> 11:17.384
in a red union suit,
basically red tights,

11:17.385 --> 11:19.425
a domino mask
which is a little mask

11:19.429 --> 11:21.805
like what Robin wears now,

11:21.806 --> 11:24.474
stiff wings
attached to the arms,

11:24.475 --> 11:27.394
and, as far as we
know, nothing more,

11:27.395 --> 11:30.015
no other
distinguishing elements.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.982
And he had enough sense to know

11:31.983 --> 11:33.942
that this was not good enough,

11:33.943 --> 11:35.363
and he knew who to call.

11:35.364 --> 11:38.655
Bill Finger.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.906
They get together.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.994
They're huddling
over this drawing,

11:43.995 --> 11:46.325
and Bill looked at
the red suit and said,

11:46.331 --> 11:49.669
"This is not suitable for
a creature of the night.

11:49.670 --> 11:51.287
"He's got to be
darker," so he said,

11:51.294 --> 11:53.253
"Let's darken
the whole costume."

11:53.254 --> 11:54.813
He looked at the
little mask and said,

11:54.814 --> 11:56.673
"This is not going to
intimidate criminals."

11:56.674 --> 11:58.680
Let's cover most of
his face with a cowl

11:58.681 --> 11:59.836
and put pointed ears on it,

11:59.844 --> 12:02.560
so that he actually
looks like his namesake.

12:02.561 --> 12:04.805
The stiff wings
are not practical

12:04.807 --> 12:07.186
for obvious reasons,
so let's ditch the wings

12:07.187 --> 12:09.725
and give him a cape
with a scalloped edge

12:09.729 --> 12:11.559
which will fly out behind him

12:11.564 --> 12:14.107
"and look like wings."

12:14.108 --> 12:16.648
You set the tone of
this character's essence

12:16.653 --> 12:18.243
from his visuals
before you know a thing

12:18.244 --> 12:20.488
about his personality
and his mission.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.824
So that was all Bill.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.445
Bill reconstructed Batman

12:24.452 --> 12:27.412
into the Batman that
we all know today.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.793
Bob apparently
went to the company

12:28.794 --> 12:30.580
on Monday morning
with this sketch.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.963
Did not mention that there
was anyone else involved,

12:32.964 --> 12:36.671
and said, "This is my idea."

12:36.673 --> 12:38.970
I have been told, although
I've never been privy,

12:38.971 --> 12:40.547
of course, to the contract,

12:40.551 --> 12:44.888
that that contract included

12:44.889 --> 12:47.015
specifically a stipulation

12:47.016 --> 12:51.596
that Batman would
hereafter be listed

12:51.604 --> 12:54.064
as the sole
creation of Bob Kane.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.275
Bob went back to Bill
and presumably said,

12:56.276 --> 12:57.936
"Great news, they
want to buy Batman,"

12:57.944 --> 13:00.237
so you'll write it
and I'll draw it,

13:00.238 --> 13:01.238
and my name will be on it

13:01.239 --> 13:02.779
because I sold it, of course,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.952
"and I'll give you a portion
of what I get paid."

13:04.953 --> 13:06.579
Nothing was signed,
as far as we know,

13:06.580 --> 13:09.787
but it was something that
they mutually agreed on.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.579
So Bill was not credited
at all from the beginning,

13:12.583 --> 13:14.503
and within a couple of months,

13:14.504 --> 13:16.837
Batman was on the newsstands.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.340
Batman debuted in '39
and, essentially,

13:23.344 --> 13:27.848
it was from 1939 to 1965
where Bill was anonymous.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.726
It's one thing for
Bob Kane in 1939

13:30.727 --> 13:33.097
to take full credit for Batman

13:33.104 --> 13:34.773
when Bill Finger agreed to it,

13:34.774 --> 13:36.522
but where the story
changes dramatically

13:36.524 --> 13:39.114
is in the '60s when
Bill is coaxed out.

13:39.115 --> 13:42.446
At that point, Bob had
a decision to make.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.866
"Am I going to own up to this

13:43.867 --> 13:46.615
or am I going to deny it
from my position of power?"

13:46.617 --> 13:48.787
He had a chance to take,
obviously, the high road

13:48.788 --> 13:49.886
or the low road,

13:49.887 --> 13:53.287
and he took the way low road.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.629
When Jerry's article about
what Bill Finger had done

13:56.630 --> 13:57.836
on Batman came out,

13:57.837 --> 14:00.297
of course it made
Bob Kane go ballistic

14:00.298 --> 14:01.878
the minute that he saw it,

14:01.883 --> 14:04.760
so he went to the
editor of <i>Batmania</i>

14:04.761 --> 14:08.638
and he wrote half a
dozen pages of diatribe.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.639
Obviously, Bob Kane did not want.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.191
Bill Finger's story told

14:12.192 --> 14:15.475
and took tremendous
offense at it.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.020
"Here, for the first time,"

14:17.023 --> 14:18.732
straight from the horse's mouth,

14:18.733 --> 14:21.862
is the real inside story
about myself and Batman.

14:21.863 --> 14:23.490
It seemed to me that Bill Finger

14:23.491 --> 14:26.198
has given out the impression
that he and not myself

14:26.199 --> 14:28.658
created the 'Batman'
as well as Robin

14:28.659 --> 14:31.289
and all the other leading
villains and characters.

14:31.290 --> 14:34.827
"This statement is fraudulent
and entirely untrue!"

14:34.832 --> 14:36.832
There was one man's
word against the other.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.172
There was no reality show

14:38.173 --> 14:40.754
documenting the birth
of Batman, of course.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.005
It was two guys in an apartment

14:42.006 --> 14:44.006
in the Bronx in 1939
when most people had

14:44.008 --> 14:45.508
much bigger things
to worry about

14:45.510 --> 14:47.590
than who's coming up with
this guy dressed as a bat?

14:47.591 --> 14:49.805
"The truth is that Bill
Finger is taking credit"

14:49.806 --> 14:51.636
for much more than he deserves,

14:51.641 --> 14:54.601
and I refute much of his
statements here in print.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.022
The fact is that I
conceived the 'Batman' figure

14:57.023 --> 14:59.189
and costume entirely by myself.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.110
I created the title, masthead,

15:01.111 --> 15:02.528
the format and concept,

15:02.529 --> 15:05.147
"as well as the Batman
figure and costume."

15:05.154 --> 15:07.494
I don't think that
Bob Kane ever wanted

15:07.495 --> 15:09.074
anything out in writing

15:09.075 --> 15:10.575
that would admit
that anybody else

15:10.576 --> 15:12.576
had a hand in creating
anything for Batman.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.288
His whole myth,
his contract with DC,

15:15.289 --> 15:17.879
his name on the stories
all owed to the fact

15:17.880 --> 15:20.705
that he was the
creator of Batman.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.340
When Bob chose to respond

15:22.341 --> 15:24.878
to Bill's coming out
by writing a letter

15:24.882 --> 15:28.510
denying Bill's
involvement to that degree,

15:28.511 --> 15:30.849
Bob was, in effect,
changing the course

15:30.850 --> 15:32.387
of his life with this letter.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.270
He was saying, "I'm
going to have to stick"

15:34.271 --> 15:36.977
to this story forever."

15:39.689 --> 15:42.899
We're all born with a
natural creative potential.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.940
Every man has it
and every woman.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.821
The idea is to find
out what that is.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.072
And it's like a
little birdie tells you

15:50.074 --> 15:52.914
and whispers in your ear,
it's an intuitive thing.

15:52.915 --> 15:55.370
No one can tell
you that but God.

15:55.371 --> 15:59.374
And I knew I had that
when I was eight or ten

15:59.375 --> 16:01.625
that I wanted to be
a famous cartoonist.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.546
Bob Kane was a kid
from the Bronx,

16:04.547 --> 16:08.297
and he was an artist
with big dreams.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.260
He was a go-getter
and he was working

16:10.261 --> 16:13.099
for the company that
would become DC Comics

16:13.100 --> 16:15.927
which at that point was
called <i>National Periodical.</i>

16:15.933 --> 16:18.443
Bob and Bill met at a party.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.817
They didn't know each
other previous to that

16:22.818 --> 16:25.065
even though they went
to the same high school.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.027
And Bill was a shoe salesman.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.279
He had aspirations
to become a writer.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.781
I said, "Why don't
you try writing"

16:31.782 --> 16:33.282
for the new comic book?"

16:33.284 --> 16:35.581
Bob was already
working in comics,

16:35.582 --> 16:37.958
drawing stories, and Bob
could immediately sense

16:37.959 --> 16:41.495
that Bill was good with
narrative, had good ideas.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.500
It sounds like they were

16:42.501 --> 16:43.810
very different types of people,

16:43.811 --> 16:45.301
but I think what
they had in common

16:45.302 --> 16:49.126
was their love of the
new medium of comics.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.640
In the early days,
really, it was Superman

16:53.641 --> 16:56.638
that brought the comic
book publishing industry

16:56.641 --> 17:01.311
out of this mire of
reprints of comic strips.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.481
It was very much kind of
a fly-by-night industry.

17:04.482 --> 17:05.779
You had a comic publisher

17:05.780 --> 17:08.025
which is maybe a couple
guys at a couple desks

17:08.027 --> 17:10.317
in a couple of rooms
in Midtown somewhere,

17:10.320 --> 17:12.111
and what they largely
did is they farmed out

17:12.114 --> 17:13.823
the actual production
of comic book stories

17:13.824 --> 17:16.034
to what were known as "shops."

17:16.035 --> 17:18.244
You had guys just laying
down the pencil artwork,

17:18.246 --> 17:20.406
you had inkers and finishers
that were then putting

17:20.414 --> 17:22.374
permanent artwork
on top of that.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.665
There were people
doing paste up,

17:23.667 --> 17:25.268
there were people
adding word balloons.

17:25.269 --> 17:27.337
Bob Kane and Bill Finger

17:27.338 --> 17:30.006
were, in effect, a sort of shop.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.047
Bob was the only one

17:31.050 --> 17:32.840
dealing with the
publisher directly.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.887
Kane had his name on
the Batman stories,

17:35.888 --> 17:38.017
but he didn't tell
anybody about Bill Finger,

17:38.018 --> 17:39.425
and, of course, you assumed

17:39.433 --> 17:42.894
that he had done
the whole thing,

17:42.895 --> 17:44.895
and I think that's just
the way Bob wanted it.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.397
From a corporation
point of view,

17:47.400 --> 17:48.690
they contract Bob Kane,

17:48.693 --> 17:50.986
Bob Kane is supposed to
deliver pages to them,

17:50.987 --> 17:52.307
and that's all they cared about.

17:52.313 --> 17:54.219
They're going, "I don't
care how you build it,"

17:54.220 --> 17:56.195
right, just, "I need it
built every 30 days"

17:56.200 --> 17:58.870
because we've got a publishing
deadline coming here."

17:58.871 --> 18:01.079
So in order to meet the demands

18:01.080 --> 18:03.418
of the hungry audience
and feed the machine

18:03.419 --> 18:05.166
and earn money by cranking out

18:05.167 --> 18:07.417
as many different Batman
titles as possible,

18:07.420 --> 18:09.838
they would hire ghost
writers back in the day.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.479
Bob Kane would get
credit for the story.

18:11.482 --> 18:13.132
He'd hand it in,
"Here's my Batman story."

18:13.134 --> 18:14.662
They're like, "Bob,
you're a genius,"

18:14.663 --> 18:16.450
and, you know, that's
how the industry worked

18:16.451 --> 18:17.455
for a long, long time.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.353
Most ghost artists
or ghost writers

18:19.354 --> 18:22.058
were there just to
execute the vision

18:22.059 --> 18:24.809
or the work directive
of the guy hiring them.

18:24.812 --> 18:28.072
They weren't there to sort
of create new concepts.

18:28.073 --> 18:31.895
But because Bill Finger
was there at the beginning,

18:31.902 --> 18:33.902
he wasn't just a ghost writer.

18:33.904 --> 18:37.407
He wasn't just the guy
that was brought on later on

18:37.408 --> 18:40.408
when Batman was already
running and successful

18:40.411 --> 18:43.246
and all the tropes
were in place.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.916
Bill Finger basically
created all those tropes,

18:46.917 --> 18:51.504
but in the actual work hierarchy

18:51.505 --> 18:54.175
as just a ghost writer.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.347
I had never researched
a person to this extent.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.929
I mean, this became
such a quest,

19:03.934 --> 19:05.064
and there just seemed to be

19:05.065 --> 19:07.979
such a higher moral
obligation to this.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.440
You know, this is 700 pages
of information on a subject

19:11.442 --> 19:13.120
that some people told
me at the beginning,

19:13.121 --> 19:15.138
"There's nothing more to
learn about Bill Finger."

19:15.139 --> 19:17.364
I did feel this
calling to do this.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.545
Especially with something as

19:18.549 --> 19:19.949
phenomenally
successful as Batman,

19:19.950 --> 19:23.370
how could this not have
been so well-known?

19:23.371 --> 19:25.959
The first panel of
the first Batman story,

19:25.960 --> 19:27.456
just setting up this mysterious,

19:27.458 --> 19:29.288
foreboding character says,

19:29.293 --> 19:31.920
"His identity remains unknown."

19:31.921 --> 19:34.341
Obviously that's Bill
writing about Batman,

19:34.342 --> 19:36.260
but it ended up being a prophesy

19:36.261 --> 19:39.886
because Bill was
Batman's secret identity.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.717
When I started the
research on this project,

19:42.723 --> 19:44.852
there were only two known photos

19:44.853 --> 19:46.269
of Bill in circulation.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.808
It was either him with
a baseball cap in profile

19:48.813 --> 19:53.650
or him golfing, half in
shadow and not that close.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.319
From seven sources
over nine months,

19:56.320 --> 19:59.780
I ended up finding 11
more photos of Bill.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.242
He was interviewed
only a few times,

20:02.243 --> 20:03.952
so for a man of Bill's impact

20:03.953 --> 20:06.541
to have only these few
recorded interviews

20:06.542 --> 20:08.169
in existence is just staggering,

20:08.170 --> 20:12.165
so the first time was
Jerry Bail's in 1965

20:12.169 --> 20:16.339
and then for the 1970
book <i>History of Comics.</i>

20:16.340 --> 20:18.630
And it turns out that in 1972,

20:18.634 --> 20:21.553
a man in California
named Robert Porfirio

20:21.554 --> 20:23.680
interviewed Bill on audio.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.018
It took a while, but eventually

20:25.019 --> 20:27.475
we actually did find
this audio recording...

20:27.476 --> 20:30.056
Testing, one... do you want
to say something, or...?

20:30.062 --> 20:31.229
Yeah, sure.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.020
How are you?

20:33.023 --> 20:37.026
Which was one of the
more emotional moments

20:37.027 --> 20:38.447
I would say, for me,
because it was

20:38.454 --> 20:40.664
the first time that
I heard Bill's voice.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.057
To write this book,

21:08.058 --> 21:10.808
I spoke to more than 250 people.

21:10.811 --> 21:14.606
Of that number,
a handful, maybe a dozen,

21:14.607 --> 21:17.317
knew both Bill
and Bob personally.

21:17.318 --> 21:20.198
Two of the creators
that were hugely helpful

21:20.199 --> 21:23.776
and impactful in this
process were Jerry Robinson,

21:23.783 --> 21:25.953
one of the earliest
Batman ghost artists,

21:25.954 --> 21:27.577
and Carmine Infantino.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.368
He was the artist that redefined.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.871
Batman's look in the '60s,

21:30.873 --> 21:32.793
and Carmine went on
to become the publisher

21:32.794 --> 21:35.877
of DC Comics for
a time in the '70s.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.048
He was genius, literally genius.

21:38.049 --> 21:39.714
I believe that.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.925
I know Bob tried to take
credit for everything.

21:41.926 --> 21:46.304
He should have been credited
as co-creator of Batman.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.675
He said, "I'd like to
get some ownership."

21:48.682 --> 21:50.522
No, he didn't say,
he said, "I'd like to get"

21:50.523 --> 21:53.017
a piece of that
because I did it."

21:53.020 --> 21:56.068
So, but then he said,
"I can't afford a lawyer,

21:56.069 --> 21:58.645
and they know that,"
quote, "They know that."

21:58.651 --> 22:02.737
They told me in, you know,
in no uncertain terms,

22:02.738 --> 22:03.918
that they thought Bill Finger

22:03.923 --> 22:05.782
was deprived of his legacy.

22:05.783 --> 22:08.451
He is the Batman, Bill was.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.040
Everything you would think
that's good, that's Bill.

22:11.041 --> 22:12.788
They take away their humanity

22:12.790 --> 22:14.960
when you take away their credit.

22:14.961 --> 22:16.459
Basically both of them said,

22:16.460 --> 22:18.300
"Without Bill,
there'd be no Batman."

22:18.301 --> 22:20.045
It's that simple.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.797
And that's because
Bill did the following:

22:22.800 --> 22:25.590
Bill Finger was the
dominant creative force

22:25.594 --> 22:28.429
and original writer of Batman,

22:28.430 --> 22:31.975
Robin, the Joker,
Catwoman, the Riddler,

22:31.976 --> 22:34.266
the Penguin, the Scarecrow,

22:34.270 --> 22:36.980
Commissioner Gordon,
Bruce Wayne, and Dick Grayson.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.690
He named Gotham City.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.900
He nicknamed Batman
"The Dark Knight."

22:40.901 --> 22:42.989
He was the first person
to write a story

22:42.990 --> 22:44.567
with the Batmobile
and the Batcave

22:44.572 --> 22:45.989
called those things.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.780
He wrote Batman's origin.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.662
It was just a two-page
story, but it was seismic.

22:50.663 --> 22:53.540
This eight-year-old boy
sees his parents murdered

22:53.541 --> 22:55.119
right before his eyes
and makes a vow

22:55.124 --> 22:58.877
that he will not let this
happen to other people.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.168
I mean, the guy
built this world.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.215
He kept what he called
the "gimmick book."

23:04.216 --> 23:05.816
He would fill that
up with story ideas,

23:05.818 --> 23:07.298
and he would just
sometimes take a bus

23:07.303 --> 23:09.012
around the city to get inspired.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.101
He would just notate
and just be an observer.

23:11.102 --> 23:13.348
He would do extensive
research for scripts.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.520
He would attach
clippings for the artists

23:15.521 --> 23:17.188
so that they would
have reference.

23:17.189 --> 23:18.646
He thought very visually.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.767
He thought cinematically.

23:19.773 --> 23:23.026
He would write these
big, epic scenes.

23:23.027 --> 23:25.397
One of the things that
he's best known for

23:25.404 --> 23:27.870
was writing stories
with oversized props,

23:27.871 --> 23:29.985
so Batman and Robin
fighting on top

23:29.992 --> 23:32.080
of a giant typewriter
with some criminals,

23:32.081 --> 23:33.827
and this stuff was
just wildly fun

23:33.829 --> 23:35.038
and inventive to look at.

23:35.039 --> 23:38.079
He had a hero who
looked like a villain.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.962
He had a superhero who
was also a detective.

23:40.963 --> 23:43.049
He was smart, he wasn't
just using brawn,

23:43.050 --> 23:44.627
he was using brains too.

23:44.632 --> 23:47.052
Bill took all this and
put it in a crucible

23:47.053 --> 23:48.141
and mixed it together

23:48.142 --> 23:51.255
and brought this
deeper sense to stories

23:51.263 --> 23:55.224
that up to that point were
considered somewhat frivolous.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.305
The aspects of
the character, man,

23:57.311 --> 23:59.399
that Bill brought to
it, like the notion

23:59.400 --> 24:01.726
of a little boy in the
city with his parents

24:01.732 --> 24:03.982
who get gunned down,
and at a young age,

24:03.984 --> 24:05.574
that's what he's
going to take with him

24:05.575 --> 24:07.359
for the rest of his life.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.492
And the dude is
just a human being

24:09.493 --> 24:10.618
who's just a guy.

24:10.619 --> 24:12.156
That's it, got no superpowers.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.468
He's got some
pretty nifty things

24:13.469 --> 24:16.159
in his belt and stuff,
but he's relentless.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.832
He's a creature of passion.

24:17.833 --> 24:20.416
It's a character that
kind of keeps you reaching.

24:20.417 --> 24:21.747
It's a character
that people build

24:21.752 --> 24:25.546
their moral compass upon,
or, "That's my guy."

24:25.547 --> 24:28.627
That's what makes
Batman so beautiful.

24:28.634 --> 24:32.095
You don't get there
without Bill Finger, man.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.098
Week after week,
the Caped Crusader

24:38.102 --> 24:41.022
copes with the tricky
traps of vicious villains.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.605
The breakout culturally,

24:44.608 --> 24:47.318
as well as simply
in the ratings books,

24:47.319 --> 24:50.989
was the 1966 Batman
television series.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.200
See the Dynamic Duo

24:52.201 --> 24:54.199
dangle from new
heights of danger.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.160
Careful, Robin,
it's quite a drop.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.870
This was not the
dark and serious

24:57.871 --> 24:59.041
creature of the night

24:59.042 --> 25:01.708
as created by Bob Kane
and Bill Finger.

25:01.709 --> 25:04.839
It caused quite a stir
in what was the beginning

25:04.840 --> 25:08.167
of the pop art phase
of America's culture.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.633
Be with Batman and
Robin twice weekly

25:10.634 --> 25:13.219
in color, of course, on ABC.

25:17.141 --> 25:21.310
Starting with the debut of
the Batman TV show in 1966,

25:21.311 --> 25:24.061
Bill and Bob's
trajectories diverged

25:24.064 --> 25:26.607
even more starkly
than ever before.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.818
You know, Bob was
just going up, up, up,

25:28.819 --> 25:30.948
and Bill was really plummeting.

25:30.949 --> 25:33.865
The TV show changed
Bob's life dramatically

25:33.866 --> 25:36.946
because that's where he got
a big payout for Batman

25:36.952 --> 25:38.828
which made him wealthy.

25:38.829 --> 25:43.749
You stopped drawing the
comic book in the '60s,

25:43.751 --> 25:46.671
and what happened, did
you sell the rights then?

25:46.672 --> 25:49.130
No, it wasn't that,
when I stopped drawing,

25:49.131 --> 25:50.921
I never sold all the rights.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.509
I own a piece of the Batman.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.010
And so you still have...

25:55.012 --> 25:57.182
You still have a
copyright on Batman?

25:57.183 --> 25:59.851
Well, everyone wants to
know that, don't they?

25:59.852 --> 26:02.729
I'll let you figure it...
I'll let you figure it out.

26:02.730 --> 26:05.148
I answered it before,
a piece of it.

26:05.149 --> 26:06.564
A piece of it, okay.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.065
It's a pie.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.397
It's a pie that's cut up.

26:11.945 --> 26:15.565
After the Batman TV show,
Bob was able to parlay that

26:15.574 --> 26:18.201
into some degree of celebrity

26:18.202 --> 26:19.872
without being directly involved.

26:19.873 --> 26:22.205
He was in full-on peacock mode

26:22.206 --> 26:26.876
displaying himself as
Batman's real-life alter ego.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.377
He wanted to be famous, right?

26:28.378 --> 26:31.717
I mean, which was odd
because most creative people

26:31.718 --> 26:33.835
in our industry
just... they did it

26:33.842 --> 26:35.262
for the creative reasons

26:35.263 --> 26:37.804
because they were
just manic artists.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.555
But I got a sense
outta Mr. Kane,

26:39.556 --> 26:43.476
that it was like a plan
and, "Oh, I got to do artwork"

26:43.477 --> 26:45.146
to get the quasi-celebrity,"

26:45.147 --> 26:47.015
which was sort of
reverse engineering

26:47.022 --> 26:48.231
from what most of us do.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.041
We just go, "We do art,
and oh, by the way",

26:50.042 --> 26:52.032
people think we're
famous, oh, cool."

26:52.033 --> 26:55.777
And then I started
painting Batman oils

26:55.781 --> 26:57.828
and I have other non-Batman art,

26:57.829 --> 27:00.325
and I've had shows all over
the world with my art.

27:00.327 --> 27:05.206
So he starts doing a series
of Batman lithographs,

27:05.207 --> 27:08.247
and he's pushing
these lithos as his,

27:08.252 --> 27:11.879
and, again, he's got
another ghost artist

27:11.880 --> 27:15.220
who's, you know, actually
doing these lithographs.

27:15.221 --> 27:17.797
Bob made his careers

27:17.803 --> 27:19.850
by having other
people do the work

27:19.851 --> 27:21.137
and putting his name on it.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.930
That was his...
That was his strategy.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.481
It was Bob Kane's pictures

27:25.482 --> 27:27.307
you saw in magazines
and newspapers.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.898
It was about Bob Kane's
art gallery showings.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.439
Bob became one of the first-ever

27:33.443 --> 27:35.113
comic book celebrities.

27:36.655 --> 27:40.324
The Batman TV show did
almost nothing for Bill.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.575
The significance of it was

27:41.577 --> 27:43.536
that Bill was the
only writer from comics

27:43.537 --> 27:45.617
who wrote an episode
of the TV show.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.372
Actually, the Batman
show that he co-wrote

27:47.374 --> 27:49.333
with his friend
named Charles Sinclair

27:49.334 --> 27:53.296
was his only
published Batman credit.

27:53.297 --> 27:56.377
We did a Batman TV thing,

27:56.383 --> 27:59.760
and "The Clock King's
Crazy Crimes,"

27:59.761 --> 28:01.137
thank you very much.

28:01.138 --> 28:04.428
And Bill thought of
all kinds of gimmicks

28:04.433 --> 28:07.560
for clocks and time.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.645
When we got confirmation

28:09.646 --> 28:12.976
that we had sold to Batman,

28:12.983 --> 28:16.569
Bill was kind of digging
his toe in the sand

28:16.570 --> 28:18.154
and hemming and hawing,

28:18.155 --> 28:20.275
and I knew he had
something on his mind.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.692
Finally, I said, "Come on, Bill",

28:21.693 --> 28:22.860
what the hell's on your mind?

28:22.861 --> 28:24.368
There's something eating you.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.204
"What is it and how
can I help you?"

28:27.205 --> 28:31.955
Well, it was the
billing on the show.

28:31.960 --> 28:37.380
Bill said, "Could I just
this once get top billing?"

28:37.382 --> 28:41.344
I said, "Sure, why not?"

28:41.345 --> 28:45.014
Bill Finger,
at that point in time,

28:45.015 --> 28:48.725
had a little
black-and-white TV set.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.607
I said, "Bill, you've
got to see this thing"

28:51.608 --> 28:53.725
"in color," you know.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.858
So I called a friend at ABC,

28:55.859 --> 29:02.569
and we went and sat in
a client viewing room...

29:02.574 --> 29:04.992
and saw this Batman thing,

29:04.993 --> 29:09.538
Bill and I, on a big color set.

29:09.539 --> 29:12.289
Bill was
thunderstruck, you know?

29:12.292 --> 29:16.045
I don't know if he
actually had any tears

29:16.046 --> 29:17.376
running down his
cheeks, you know,

29:17.381 --> 29:20.381
but I think he
came pretty close.

29:20.384 --> 29:24.470
Bang, he saw his name,
you know, top billing

29:24.471 --> 29:27.139
in color on a big TV screen.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.310
I mean, this was
like the high point

29:29.311 --> 29:31.519
of his creative life.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.527
Most of the Golden Age writers

29:39.528 --> 29:41.445
began to be phased out

29:41.446 --> 29:44.276
by the middle and
latter '60s at DC.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.826
A new era of talent
were coming in,

29:46.827 --> 29:48.117
fans who were becoming

29:48.120 --> 29:50.079
the new writers of comic books,

29:50.080 --> 29:52.000
the new artists of comic books,

29:52.001 --> 29:55.084
and people from the
original generation

29:55.085 --> 29:57.165
were finding it
harder and harder

29:57.170 --> 29:59.088
and harder to adapt.

29:59.089 --> 30:01.259
The company was saying,
"Just because they may have"

30:01.260 --> 30:03.968
co-created or written these
characters back in the '40s,

30:03.969 --> 30:05.428
"we need young, fresh blood."

30:05.429 --> 30:07.759
Who cares if Bill
Finger writes Batman?

30:07.764 --> 30:10.102
There seemed to be
a lack of respect

30:10.103 --> 30:11.434
for his body of work.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.435
I mean, that's how some
people would interpret it.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.367
This was not just a guy
who created a character

30:15.372 --> 30:16.691
that we've used a few times.

30:16.692 --> 30:18.480
This is a guy who
created an entire world

30:18.483 --> 30:21.318
that we are milking to the bone.

30:21.319 --> 30:24.069
So I can't even
imagine what he felt.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.822
He spent the rest
of the '60s writing,

30:25.824 --> 30:28.951
but not Batman, not even comics.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.120
He wrote carpentry articles,

30:31.121 --> 30:34.290
he ended up writing for
the <i>Army Pictorial Center.</i>

30:34.291 --> 30:36.751
So he was always
struggling for money.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.169
He was under strain,

30:38.170 --> 30:42.130
I think he was
skimping on medications.

30:42.132 --> 30:45.634
I don't think
he was eating well,

30:45.635 --> 30:46.675
and he was sliding,

30:46.678 --> 30:48.758
and I couldn't do
too much about it.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.891
He was just getting by
and slogging through

30:51.892 --> 30:54.101
and watching his
character get bigger

30:54.102 --> 30:57.021
than ever before and
being more detached from it

30:57.022 --> 30:58.152
than ever before.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.820
My very first comic convention

31:01.821 --> 31:05.154
was the 1973 New York City

31:05.155 --> 31:08.695
July 4th Com Convention
at the Commodore Hotel,

31:08.700 --> 31:10.990
and the keynote speaker
of that convention

31:10.994 --> 31:13.704
was Bob Kane, and
I was a Batman fan!

31:13.705 --> 31:16.035
And I remember
standing in the back

31:16.041 --> 31:18.501
of this packed ballroom

31:18.502 --> 31:20.211
where Bob Kane
was a little speck

31:20.212 --> 31:22.171
in the distance on the stage.

31:22.172 --> 31:24.672
But what do I remember hearing?

31:24.674 --> 31:26.721
"I created Batman,
I created Robin,

31:26.722 --> 31:28.718
I created the Joker,
I created the... ".

31:28.720 --> 31:32.848
"I, I, I, I, I..."
that's what I remember.

31:32.849 --> 31:35.978
And the thing is is that
we didn't know at the time,

31:35.979 --> 31:37.897
but Bill Finger was still alive

31:37.898 --> 31:41.356
in the summer of '73,
probably on his last legs.

31:41.358 --> 31:44.568
So what really upsets
me about Bob Kane

31:44.569 --> 31:47.569
is that right up until
the time Bill Finger died,

31:47.572 --> 31:50.699
his friend and partner
who co-created Batman,

31:50.700 --> 31:53.744
that gave Bob Kane a
living and notoriety

31:53.745 --> 31:55.035
for the rest of his life,

31:55.038 --> 31:59.875
he allowed to die
penniless and unknown.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.626
And for that, there
is no forgiveness

32:01.628 --> 32:04.255
for Bob Kane.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.126
In the early '70s,
Bill did begin to write

32:07.134 --> 32:08.721
for comics again and for DC.

32:08.722 --> 32:10.468
He began to
write mystery stories,

32:10.470 --> 32:13.220
and he had two
stories due on a Friday,

32:13.223 --> 32:15.603
he turned in only
one and went home,

32:15.604 --> 32:18.560
presumably to finish
the second one.

32:18.562 --> 32:22.231
This was January 18th, 1974.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.402
He was living alone in Manhattan

32:24.403 --> 32:25.611
in a small apartment

32:25.612 --> 32:27.740
in the same building as Charles.

32:29.489 --> 32:32.079
On this particular day,
I had not heard from Bill

32:32.080 --> 32:34.905
for like a couple of days,

32:34.911 --> 32:38.747
and I'm carrying a duplicate key

32:38.748 --> 32:41.667
for his apartment.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.208
I went to the apartment,

32:44.212 --> 32:46.212
and he was behind in his rent.

32:46.214 --> 32:50.593
The landlord had eviction
notices on his door.

32:50.594 --> 32:53.012
I used my key and went in.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.267
I walked up to him.

32:58.268 --> 33:02.478
He had a blanket like
pulled up to about here.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.107
I pulled it down.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.985
Looked, looked,
and looked, you know.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.446
No movement, nothing, you know?

33:10.447 --> 33:14.617
And I reached down,
shook his shoulder.

33:14.618 --> 33:17.328
Nothing.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.915
Poor Bill had died alone

33:20.916 --> 33:24.206
with his little
television set going on.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.131
I thought, you know, what a...

33:26.132 --> 33:30.174
Kind of a sad little end.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.886
The world has lost a
very interesting guy.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.979
So when I asked Charles.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.150
"What happened to
Bill after he died?"

33:46.151 --> 33:48.399
Charles said,
"Marc, I don't think

33:48.401 --> 33:51.361
we want to talk about that."

33:51.363 --> 33:54.198
And I said, "You're
probably right."

33:54.199 --> 33:57.239
I know it's difficult,
but I do have to ask."

33:57.244 --> 33:58.764
And then Charles
said that he thought

33:58.765 --> 34:02.872
that Bill was buried
in a potter's field.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.502
It's a graveyard
of unmarked graves.

34:06.503 --> 34:07.733
People that don't have someone

34:07.734 --> 34:09.338
to take care of them.

34:09.339 --> 34:12.179
Homeless people... I
mean, it's desperately,

34:12.179 --> 34:14.835
desperately sad.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.388
The medical
examiner report says,

34:17.389 --> 34:21.389
"natural causes,
no family, no history,"

34:21.393 --> 34:22.773
which of course was referring

34:22.774 --> 34:25.018
to his medical history,

34:25.021 --> 34:28.107
but when you read
that now, textually,

34:28.108 --> 34:30.688
it's eerie because
this medical examiner

34:30.694 --> 34:34.612
had no idea the immensely
significant history

34:34.614 --> 34:37.157
that this man had.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.576
So when I heard
that, I just thought,

34:39.577 --> 34:40.886
you know, just on a human level

34:40.887 --> 34:43.416
we've got to do
something for this guy.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.623
There are so many
fans who clamber

34:45.625 --> 34:47.534
for justice for the creators.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.853
I think in the end it takes more

34:48.855 --> 34:50.842
than this amorphous
mass of fans.

34:50.844 --> 34:53.549
There has to be one
person who steps up

34:53.550 --> 34:55.340
and leads the charge.

34:57.304 --> 34:58.973
When I started this project,

34:58.974 --> 35:00.681
I was already a
published author.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.979
I wanted to tell
another good story.

35:02.980 --> 35:04.386
And then when I learned

35:04.394 --> 35:06.904
how much there was to
reveal about Bill's life

35:06.905 --> 35:10.566
and how much more we
could do on his behalf,

35:10.567 --> 35:14.567
it became not only
a book but a crusade.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.740
My goal became getting
Bill's name on Batman,

35:17.741 --> 35:20.871
to get this man the credit
that will never go away,

35:20.872 --> 35:23.579
that will hang over all of this.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.208
I had a couple
of people that said,

35:25.209 --> 35:27.706
"What you are trying
to do will never happen."

35:27.709 --> 35:29.749
This is a contractually
bound line

35:29.753 --> 35:32.713
that's been in
place for 70 years,

35:32.714 --> 35:34.761
so what are you
going to do about it?

35:34.762 --> 35:36.798
"What is any one person
going to do about it?"

35:36.801 --> 35:39.141
And I said to myself,
"I have no idea,

35:39.142 --> 35:41.427
but I'm going to try."

35:49.606 --> 35:52.726
Here it is, Poe Park.

35:53.943 --> 35:55.822
So this is Poe
Park in the Bronx.

35:55.823 --> 35:57.949
This is where Bill
and Bob would come

35:57.950 --> 35:59.527
and brainstorm
ideas for stories.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.412
They would sit on
park benches here

36:01.413 --> 36:02.868
and discuss Batman.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.498
I had no idea that
I would be doing

36:04.499 --> 36:05.786
this kind of digging.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.169
This is the apartment
in which Bill was living

36:08.170 --> 36:11.496
in 1965 when he was
interviewed by Jerry Bails.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.633
He's also very righteous,
and he wants to, you know,

36:14.634 --> 36:17.424
he wants to do
right in the world,

36:17.425 --> 36:18.755
and so he is driven.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.139
Bill Finger was the
co-creator of Batman.

36:21.140 --> 36:23.764
And I am pretty sure
that he was living here

36:23.765 --> 36:25.275
at the moment that
he created Batman,

36:25.283 --> 36:27.893
so I think he was living
in one of these three units,

36:27.894 --> 36:28.981
and I'd love to see inside

36:28.982 --> 36:30.147
if you could show it.

36:30.148 --> 36:31.686
The parallel was not lost on me

36:31.690 --> 36:33.899
that Bill made
Batman a detective,

36:33.900 --> 36:36.488
and I was a detective in
pursuit of Bill's legacy.

36:36.489 --> 36:38.195
That was part of the fun of it.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.816
How did you find this out?

36:39.823 --> 36:41.073
I did a lot of research.

36:41.074 --> 36:43.994
I actually went through
the New York City phone book

36:43.995 --> 36:48.706
every year from 1930 to
1974 looking for my guy,

36:48.707 --> 36:50.577
and this is where it started.

36:50.583 --> 36:51.959
It became addictive.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.919
I felt like, if I
found this big thing

36:53.920 --> 36:56.550
that wasn't known,
there's probably more.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.472
When I started the research,
we knew this much:

37:02.473 --> 37:04.308
Bill's wife was named Portia,

37:04.309 --> 37:07.015
they were married
sometime in the 1940s.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.686
I believe that their
marriage fell apart

37:08.687 --> 37:10.475
in the '50s.

37:10.478 --> 37:13.688
To try to legally
contest a credit line,

37:13.690 --> 37:14.980
you need an heir.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.526
That was my goal
was to find an heir,

37:17.527 --> 37:19.737
so very early in my
Bill Finger research,

37:19.738 --> 37:22.158
I learned that Bill
had a son named Fred.

37:22.159 --> 37:24.697
I was super pumped that
day because I thought

37:24.701 --> 37:27.081
it's going to take
me less than a day

37:27.082 --> 37:28.618
to find Fred Finger,

37:28.621 --> 37:29.871
and it took me less than a day

37:29.873 --> 37:32.583
to find out that Fred
was Bill's only child,

37:32.584 --> 37:36.628
Fred was gay, and
Fred died in 1992,

37:36.629 --> 37:39.757
which to me implied
that he was the end

37:39.758 --> 37:41.128
of the Finger family,

37:41.134 --> 37:42.640
that there was nobody left.

37:42.641 --> 37:45.255
And while I'm writing a
book to tell a good story

37:45.263 --> 37:46.932
and tell an important story,

37:46.933 --> 37:49.771
at the same time my goal
was to do what I could

37:49.772 --> 37:52.394
to see Bill's name
added to Batman,

37:52.395 --> 37:56.315
but I knew that to do that,
you need to be an heir

37:56.316 --> 37:57.646
and there wasn't one.

37:57.650 --> 38:00.070
So I was then going
to look for anybody

38:00.071 --> 38:03.489
who might have had some
connection to this man.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.490
Apparently when you are
doing detective work,

38:05.492 --> 38:06.829
you find yourself doing things

38:06.830 --> 38:08.576
that you wouldn't
expect yourself to do.

38:08.578 --> 38:10.868
For example, I
called every Finger

38:10.872 --> 38:12.922
in the phone directory,
which was 500 names

38:12.923 --> 38:16.376
asking if they were
related to Bill Finger.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.086
Not a one was.

38:18.087 --> 38:20.837
I staked out the apartment
building that Portia,

38:20.840 --> 38:23.130
Bill's first wife, lived
in at the end of her life.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.654
I figured there
could still be people

38:24.655 --> 38:26.261
in the building who knew her.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.092
Next thing I know, I'm
sitting in an apartment

38:28.093 --> 38:30.018
with two lovely
women in their 70s

38:30.019 --> 38:32.436
who are in their nightgowns
at 6 o'clock at night

38:32.437 --> 38:35.225
telling me stories about Portia.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.939
When I didn't know
how to reach people

38:36.940 --> 38:39.940
that knew Fred, I posted fliers

38:39.943 --> 38:41.151
in community centers

38:41.152 --> 38:42.711
targeting the gay
and lesbian community

38:42.712 --> 38:44.862
saying, "Does anybody
remember Fred Finger?"

38:44.864 --> 38:45.864
It was actually a flier

38:45.865 --> 38:47.205
with the little pull-off things,

38:47.208 --> 38:49.698
you know, "I know Fred Finger"

38:49.702 --> 38:51.829
with my phone number.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.960
Yeah, it's crazy.

38:52.961 --> 38:55.746
Bill Finger was a charming guy,

38:55.750 --> 38:59.419
but he was not, I
think, a forceful guy.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.170
He was making his own way,

39:01.172 --> 39:03.966
and it was kind of permanently

39:03.967 --> 39:06.967
on the outside looking in a bit.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.304
At some point, Charles said

39:09.305 --> 39:10.764
that Bill and Portia divorced

39:10.765 --> 39:12.074
and Bill was
dating other people,

39:12.075 --> 39:14.345
and in the late '60s,
he had a lady friend

39:14.352 --> 39:16.645
named Edith Simmons.

39:16.646 --> 39:19.266
That was what Charles
said, "a lady friend."

39:19.274 --> 39:20.320
I discovered that Edith

39:20.321 --> 39:22.646
was more than just
Bill's lady friend,

39:22.652 --> 39:24.278
she was his second wife.

39:24.279 --> 39:27.819
Someone that nobody in
comics had ever heard of.

39:27.824 --> 39:33.036
He was a very amiable, pleasant,

39:33.037 --> 39:36.537
and easy-going man.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.877
He had a good sense of humor,

39:39.878 --> 39:41.798
he... do you want me to tell you

39:41.799 --> 39:44.546
about the things he
was interested in?

39:44.549 --> 39:47.217
She was, along with Charles,

39:47.218 --> 39:49.638
the two biggest finds
up until that point...

39:49.639 --> 39:51.307
The two people that I thought

39:51.308 --> 39:52.846
would ensure that this was

39:52.849 --> 39:54.477
the first real
version of Bill Finger

39:54.478 --> 39:56.185
that we would get to know.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.690
He was interested
in a lot of things.

40:02.692 --> 40:05.861
He loved ballet, for
instance, I loved it.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.946
We went together.

40:07.947 --> 40:11.277
He was very knowledgeable
about theater,

40:11.284 --> 40:13.201
about movies.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.245
He was proud of being a very,

40:15.246 --> 40:18.076
very good comic book writer.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.208
There are several heroes,

40:20.209 --> 40:22.129
in my opinion, in this story.

40:22.130 --> 40:24.378
When Lyn, his second wife,

40:24.380 --> 40:25.880
learned that they were making

40:25.882 --> 40:27.179
a big budget Batman movie,

40:27.180 --> 40:30.425
which would become Tim
Burton's 1989 Batman movie,

40:30.428 --> 40:34.056
she tried to get Bill
credit in that movie.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.927
This time it is
to the big screen.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.853
Warner Brothers
is spending millions

40:37.854 --> 40:39.272
to bring millionaire Bruce Wayne

40:39.273 --> 40:41.270
and his alter ego to life.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.942
Is this a gamble for the studio?

40:42.943 --> 40:44.278
Will Batman pay off?

40:44.279 --> 40:45.775
Will there be bat hysteria?

40:45.777 --> 40:48.397
When the first Batman
movie was coming out,

40:48.404 --> 40:51.198
my mother got very concerned

40:51.199 --> 40:54.368
that Bill was getting
no credit for it.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.369
Estimates are that
the final price tag

40:56.371 --> 40:57.831
for the Warner Brothers movie

40:57.832 --> 41:01.124
will be in the 30 to
50 million dollar range.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.745
I thought he should
get some credit

41:03.753 --> 41:05.921
on the screen,

41:05.922 --> 41:10.759
and I tried to get in
touch with the managers

41:10.760 --> 41:13.845
or whoever it was to tell them

41:13.846 --> 41:16.426
that Bill should get credit.

41:16.432 --> 41:17.932
We weren't interested in suing,

41:17.934 --> 41:20.024
because we weren't
seeking money,

41:20.025 --> 41:23.188
we were just seeking
credit for Bill.

41:23.189 --> 41:24.789
I really dealt with
the legal department

41:24.791 --> 41:26.066
a couple of times.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.317
They weren't disagreeing

41:27.318 --> 41:29.277
with Bill's co-creating Batman,

41:29.278 --> 41:31.318
there was no disagreement there.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.872
They just didn't
want to get involved

41:32.873 --> 41:35.575
in something they
didn't have to do

41:35.576 --> 41:39.826
that might open up some
liability issues for them.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.250
They, I would say,
politely declined.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.548
That long-awaited
41 million dollar film,

41:45.549 --> 41:48.455
Batman, got an old-fashioned
kickoff last night

41:48.464 --> 41:50.134
when it premiered
in Los Angeles.

41:50.135 --> 41:52.639
Thousands of fans, many
of whom waited all day

41:52.640 --> 41:54.594
outside the theater in Westwood,

41:54.595 --> 41:56.095
welcomed the scores of stars

41:56.097 --> 41:57.677
who turned out for the opening.

41:57.682 --> 42:00.482
So of course the Batman
movie was a juggernaut.

42:00.483 --> 42:02.346
Batman owned 1989.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.563
Are all those
people waiting now?

42:04.564 --> 42:05.647
You're kidding!

42:05.648 --> 42:08.525
It's Batmania this summer.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.235
Everyone wants
to see this movie.

42:10.236 --> 42:13.106
That movie was stratospheric.

42:13.114 --> 42:14.324
I've been reading comic books

42:14.325 --> 42:15.657
since I was six years old.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.528
They couldn't have done
this movie any better.

42:17.529 --> 42:19.366
Day by day, there are
more and more signals

42:19.370 --> 42:21.040
that a phenomenon is emerging.

42:21.041 --> 42:23.749
There is even a
1-800-BATMAN number

42:23.750 --> 42:26.500
in here to get your
merchandise to you faster.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.712
1989 is when Batman moved

42:28.713 --> 42:30.672
from just another superhero

42:30.673 --> 42:34.426
to a fictional character
that everybody knows.

42:34.427 --> 42:37.177
At our first Batman
premiere in 1989,

42:37.180 --> 42:40.640
Bob showed up in like
this black velour bat cape.

42:40.641 --> 42:42.851
Bob was fun, and
Bob was a showman.

42:42.852 --> 42:46.362
He loved the attention, he
reveled in the attention.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.653
My autobiography
came out, <i>Batman &amp; Me.</i>

42:51.654 --> 42:53.912
At the height of the
movie of Batman One,

42:53.913 --> 42:56.615
it sold 250,000 copies.

42:56.616 --> 42:58.075
That's the cover of me.

42:58.076 --> 43:01.536
That's the first
Batman I drew in 1939.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.958
Doing the book was interesting.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.249
I helped design the book

43:08.252 --> 43:10.796
and rewrote a lot of the book

43:10.797 --> 43:12.917
based on a lot of
interviewing I did with him.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.054
I interviewed him for hours.

43:23.476 --> 43:26.556
For me, the most significant
passage is on page 44,

43:26.562 --> 43:29.110
when Bob writes, "Now
that my longtime friend"

43:29.111 --> 43:30.727
and collaborator is gone,

43:30.733 --> 43:32.530
I must admit that
Bill never received

43:32.531 --> 43:34.986
the fame and
recognition he deserved.

43:34.987 --> 43:36.737
"He was an unsung hero."

43:43.871 --> 43:45.330
"I often tell my wife,"

43:45.331 --> 43:48.667
if I could go back
15 years before he died,

43:48.668 --> 43:50.458
I would like to say, quote,

43:50.461 --> 43:51.920
'I'll put your name on it now.

43:51.921 --> 43:53.461
"You deserve it.'"

43:53.464 --> 43:54.883
I remember when I read that,

43:54.884 --> 43:56.261
and several other people told me

43:56.262 --> 43:57.509
they had similar reactions.

43:57.510 --> 43:58.900
They were just
dumbstruck, I mean,

43:58.903 --> 44:00.643
it was just like...
It's one of those things

44:00.644 --> 44:02.408
that'll just stop you
when you're reading it

44:02.414 --> 44:04.184
if you know anything
about the situation

44:04.185 --> 44:07.519
because you are looking
at a book written...

44:07.520 --> 44:10.605
Allegedly written...
By the person

44:10.606 --> 44:12.566
who is totally responsible,

44:12.567 --> 44:14.107
or almost totally responsible,

44:14.110 --> 44:16.110
for the fact that
poor Bill Finger

44:16.112 --> 44:18.612
never got the credit
he deserved for Batman.

44:29.125 --> 44:32.125
He did have regrets at the end

44:32.128 --> 44:34.708
about Bill not getting credit.

44:37.300 --> 44:40.427
Never sufficient
regret to fix it.

44:40.428 --> 44:43.258
I don't think he would've
ever put Bill's name

44:43.264 --> 44:46.474
on the strip at that time.

44:46.475 --> 44:50.435
It opens a legal can of worms

44:50.438 --> 44:51.768
when he told me that,

44:51.772 --> 44:53.481
which he wouldn't
have wanted to get into,

44:53.482 --> 44:54.612
because then it wouldn't...

44:54.613 --> 44:57.989
It would be not
only credit but money.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.656
The other especially
notable thing

45:01.657 --> 45:05.994
about Bob's book is
this series of sketches,

45:05.995 --> 45:09.705
which are dated
January 17th, 1934.

45:20.635 --> 45:22.965
- Yeah.
- He has these drawings

45:22.970 --> 45:25.930
that he says were
stashed away as a kid

45:25.932 --> 45:27.352
and wasn't sure
whether to make it

45:27.353 --> 45:29.184
into a bird or a bat,

45:29.185 --> 45:31.845
and he said that
when he was creating

45:31.854 --> 45:35.023
this new superhero, he
remembered these drawings

45:35.024 --> 45:37.984
he had made in 1934
in this trunk,

45:37.985 --> 45:39.105
and he went to get them

45:39.111 --> 45:40.401
and this gave him
the inspiration

45:40.404 --> 45:43.744
for making a
character into a bat.

45:55.503 --> 45:56.670
Wow.

45:56.671 --> 45:58.711
I don't think that's
ever been corroborated

45:58.714 --> 46:01.011
that that's an
actual 1934 document.

46:01.012 --> 46:02.508
I mean, somebody should do

46:02.510 --> 46:04.550
a Shroud of Turin investigation

46:04.553 --> 46:07.305
on those 1934 sketches.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.426
I mean, right away,
the date alone,

46:09.433 --> 46:11.021
it's like you're telling me

46:11.022 --> 46:13.728
that at the dawn of
the comic book itself,

46:13.729 --> 46:16.398
which was created in 1933,

46:16.399 --> 46:20.944
before there were
superheroes, obviously,

46:20.945 --> 46:22.565
you're telling me
that you created

46:22.571 --> 46:24.906
a Batman-like
character, Bob Kane.

46:24.907 --> 46:28.737
Looking at the
drawing from 1934,

46:28.744 --> 46:31.037
he's wearing a cowl,

46:31.038 --> 46:34.078
and his original Batman
drawing didn't have a cowl.

46:34.083 --> 46:37.419
It also... there's
a bat emblem on it.

46:37.420 --> 46:40.755
The bat emblem was
suggested by Finger.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.926
These are not
haphazard sketches.

46:42.927 --> 46:44.755
These are something put together

46:44.760 --> 46:47.720
by someone retrospectively
trying to talk about

46:47.722 --> 46:49.522
how they came up
with this character.

47:02.069 --> 47:05.029
In this case, for a man to say,

47:05.031 --> 47:06.448
"Bill created a costume,"

47:06.449 --> 47:08.119
but here's my drawing
of the same costume

47:08.120 --> 47:10.577
"five years before."

47:10.578 --> 47:12.088
There's just no
way to look at that

47:12.089 --> 47:15.457
and not see... see
the scam going on,

47:15.458 --> 47:17.958
see a man who's
desperately trying

47:17.960 --> 47:20.210
to hold onto
something that he knows

47:20.212 --> 47:22.255
is not rightfully his.

47:22.256 --> 47:24.126
At some point, if
you tell the story

47:24.133 --> 47:26.509
enough to yourself,
then it just...

47:26.510 --> 47:29.510
Your perception
is now your reality.

47:30.973 --> 47:32.073
I do think that over time,

47:32.074 --> 47:33.408
Bob started to feel differently

47:33.409 --> 47:34.739
than he felt
when he was younger,

47:34.743 --> 47:36.313
but he probably felt
trapped by the myth

47:36.314 --> 47:38.312
of Bob Kane, which he created,

47:38.314 --> 47:40.233
and I think he probably thought,

47:40.234 --> 47:42.609
"I'm going to look much
worse if I come clean now..."

47:42.610 --> 47:44.130
even if maybe his
conscience was saying

47:44.131 --> 47:46.028
it would be the right...
Better thing to do,

47:46.030 --> 47:47.600
"than if I just...
Let's see how long"

47:47.601 --> 47:48.618
I can ride this out.

47:48.624 --> 47:50.283
Maybe I can get to the grave

47:50.284 --> 47:53.004
"with no one really
challenging me on this."

47:53.005 --> 47:55.205
One day, when I'm 120 or so,

47:55.206 --> 47:57.826
I'll look down from
the bat cave in the sky

47:57.833 --> 48:00.381
at my little creation
that goes on and on and on,

48:00.382 --> 48:02.587
and I'll just say,
"Hey, Warner Brothers"

48:02.588 --> 48:04.008
and Leonardo, just send me

48:04.009 --> 48:06.006
the residuals in the sky.

48:06.008 --> 48:07.048
I'll give you my address,

48:07.051 --> 48:10.845
"it's up there
where the angels are."

48:10.846 --> 48:12.514
Bob died in 1998.

48:12.515 --> 48:14.305
He got to live
through seeing Batman

48:14.308 --> 48:16.684
become a worldwide phenomenon,

48:16.685 --> 48:19.935
and had a proper
obituary in newspapers.

48:19.939 --> 48:23.229
He was mentioned
on nightly news.

48:23.234 --> 48:24.444
He went on to have a star

48:24.445 --> 48:27.283
on the Hollywood Walk
of Fame many years later.

48:27.284 --> 48:31.366
Bill died in 1974
with no obituary,

48:31.367 --> 48:34.367
no funeral, no gravestone...

48:35.830 --> 48:38.289
virtually unrecognized.

48:38.290 --> 48:43.545
And Bob was remembered
as the creator of Batman.

48:43.546 --> 48:45.126
His gravestone
says, "God bestowed"

48:45.131 --> 48:47.048
a dream upon Bob Kane.

48:47.049 --> 48:48.679
Blessed with divine inspiration

48:48.680 --> 48:50.296
and a rich imagination,

48:50.302 --> 48:53.888
Bob created a legacy
known as BATMAN.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.559
Bob Kane, Bruce Wayne, Batman,

48:55.560 --> 48:57.558
they are one and the same.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.850
Bob infused his dual
identity character

48:59.854 --> 49:03.731
with his own attributes:
Goodness, kindness,

49:03.732 --> 49:06.651
"compassion, sensitivity,
generosity..."

49:06.652 --> 49:08.402
I didn't know him,
and I'm very careful

49:08.404 --> 49:09.574
to emphasize that.

49:09.575 --> 49:12.407
I don't know what
he was like as a son

49:12.408 --> 49:14.238
or a husband or a father,

49:14.243 --> 49:15.912
and I want to think the best.

49:15.913 --> 49:17.961
And, you know, he
had a right to be proud

49:17.962 --> 49:20.995
of his role in Batman,
but professionally,

49:21.000 --> 49:22.330
he was not Bruce Wayne.

49:22.334 --> 49:25.004
He was not what it
says on his gravestone.

49:31.677 --> 49:34.637
Every child grows
up with parents

49:34.638 --> 49:36.968
whose jobs become
part of their...

49:36.974 --> 49:38.230
The texture of their lives,

49:38.231 --> 49:39.805
and unfortunately for my kids,

49:39.810 --> 49:42.854
that was Bill Finger,
so my kids knew more

49:42.855 --> 49:44.435
about Bill Finger
at a very young age

49:44.440 --> 49:46.980
than some hardcore
Batman fans have known

49:46.984 --> 49:49.235
at the peak of their knowledge.

49:49.236 --> 49:52.906
What about your daddy?

49:52.907 --> 49:54.365
You're my daddy!

49:54.366 --> 49:57.576
- What's my name?
- Marc Tyler.

49:57.578 --> 50:00.408
And what do I do all day?

50:00.414 --> 50:04.042
- Work!
- What's my job?

50:04.043 --> 50:06.463
Bill Finger.

50:07.671 --> 50:09.589
What do I do?

50:09.590 --> 50:12.840
- Bill Finger.
- But what does that mean?

50:12.843 --> 50:15.637
Bill Finger.

50:15.638 --> 50:18.138
- Who's Bill Finger?
- Bill Finger.

50:18.140 --> 50:19.807
Is that my friend?

50:19.808 --> 50:21.808
Yes!

50:21.810 --> 50:24.100
My daughter, for
all intents, grew up

50:24.104 --> 50:27.154
with Bill Finger as a part
of the extended family.

50:27.155 --> 50:30.859
My wife was very patient.

50:30.861 --> 50:32.111
We were young and struggling,

50:32.112 --> 50:34.741
and I was putting in a lot
of time for this project

50:34.742 --> 50:36.869
because I did get
consumed by this,

50:36.870 --> 50:38.947
and not to the point
that I was not showing up

50:38.953 --> 50:40.453
for family events or forgetting

50:40.454 --> 50:41.624
to put my shoes on,

50:41.625 --> 50:45.750
but I was really
very focused on this.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.335
Excuse me, Batman!

50:47.336 --> 50:49.086
Can I ask you a
couple questions?

50:49.088 --> 50:51.008
- Where's Batman from?
- Gotham City.

50:51.009 --> 50:52.876
And what's his real name?

50:52.883 --> 50:54.175
Bruce Wayne.

50:54.176 --> 50:58.054
- And who created him?
- Bob Kane.

50:58.055 --> 50:59.345
Just Bob Kane?

50:59.348 --> 51:01.388
When I see people
wearing Batman shirts

51:01.392 --> 51:04.102
or Batman clothes,
which I do all the time,

51:04.103 --> 51:05.853
yeah, I do smile
to myself and think,

51:05.854 --> 51:07.254
"Should I stop
that guy and ask him

51:07.255 --> 51:08.577
if he knows who Bill Finger is?"

51:08.582 --> 51:10.441
- Who's Dick Grayson?
- Dick Grayson...

51:10.442 --> 51:12.532
He's the first Robin,
also Nightwing.

51:12.533 --> 51:13.818
Who's Bill Finger?

51:13.821 --> 51:15.111
Bill Finger?

51:15.114 --> 51:16.281
Him I don't know.

51:16.282 --> 51:17.322
The story is so good,

51:17.324 --> 51:18.616
anyone wearing a Batman shirt

51:18.617 --> 51:19.677
would want to know it.

51:19.678 --> 51:21.617
I have a few
Batman T-shirts left

51:21.620 --> 51:22.908
that I would like to give out.

51:22.909 --> 51:24.195
- Does anybody want one?
- Sure!

51:24.198 --> 51:25.578
All right.

51:25.583 --> 51:27.013
They probably
looked at those shirts

51:27.014 --> 51:28.509
and said, "Wait,
this isn't Batman."

51:28.510 --> 51:30.048
This is Bill Finger...
Who's that?"

51:30.049 --> 51:31.455
It just got me thinking, well,

51:31.463 --> 51:33.219
the only way this
would be possible

51:33.220 --> 51:36.255
is if by some miracle
this book can be a part

51:36.260 --> 51:38.760
of the larger
groundswell of support

51:38.762 --> 51:40.722
that might be able
to overturn the idea

51:40.723 --> 51:43.352
that you need to be an
heir to fight for credit.

51:43.353 --> 51:45.229
Maybe there could be
enough public support

51:45.230 --> 51:46.977
to say there's enough proof

51:46.979 --> 51:48.398
that this person was involved

51:48.399 --> 51:50.477
that we don't need an
heir to make this right,

51:50.482 --> 51:52.734
to make this whole again.

51:52.735 --> 51:53.985
I mean, maybe that can happen,

51:53.986 --> 51:55.526
I mean, laws get
overturned, right?

51:57.740 --> 51:58.950
When I started this research,

51:58.951 --> 52:01.909
we knew just about
zip about Bill's family

52:01.910 --> 52:03.180
with the exception of the fact

52:03.181 --> 52:04.908
that he had a son named Fred.

52:04.913 --> 52:07.540
So I learned that
Fred was a chef,

52:07.541 --> 52:09.250
and I know that he
had spent some time

52:09.251 --> 52:12.128
on the west coast,
and it also turned out

52:12.129 --> 52:13.759
that Fred had developed AIDS

52:13.760 --> 52:15.796
and died in 1992.

52:15.799 --> 52:19.719
He was the last surviving
heir of Bill Finger.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.600
So my next approach was
to try to find people

52:22.601 --> 52:24.428
on his first wife's side.

52:24.433 --> 52:26.771
So her name was Portia,
and I decided to try

52:26.772 --> 52:29.439
to look through the
<i>New York Times</i> obituaries.

52:31.649 --> 52:34.567
Prior to 1981 if you get a hit,

52:34.568 --> 52:36.488
you don't bring
up the actual obit,

52:36.489 --> 52:39.656
you bring up the whole page
where that obit appears.

52:39.657 --> 52:42.027
So I did this for hours,
and I eventually found

52:42.034 --> 52:44.952
the obituary for
Portia's mother,

52:44.953 --> 52:46.582
which means Bill's
mother-in-law,

52:46.583 --> 52:48.750
and in that obituary
there were three names.

52:48.751 --> 52:51.419
Fred, Bill's son, which
I already knew, of course,

52:51.420 --> 52:56.005
and two of Fred's cousins,
Judy and Eric Flam.

52:56.006 --> 52:58.626
So I searched them,
and it was at probably

52:58.634 --> 53:01.554
about 11 o'clock at
night on the east coast.

53:01.555 --> 53:03.723
Judy was in Massachusetts,
too late to call her,

53:03.724 --> 53:06.682
as excited as I was,
but Eric was in Arizona,

53:06.684 --> 53:09.102
so I called him right then.

53:09.103 --> 53:11.813
And when I called Eric,
I said, "I'm a writer",

53:11.814 --> 53:12.964
and I'm working on a project

53:12.965 --> 53:15.316
"about a writer
named Bill Finger."

53:15.317 --> 53:17.276
And he said, "What did you say?"

53:17.277 --> 53:18.817
And I said, "Bill Finger,"

53:18.821 --> 53:20.700
and he put the
phone to the side,

53:20.701 --> 53:22.988
and he called to
his wife and said,

53:22.991 --> 53:24.281
"This guy's calling
about Bill Finger!"

53:24.284 --> 53:25.454
Uncle Bill, no one's ever called

53:25.455 --> 53:26.661
"about Uncle Bill before!"

53:26.662 --> 53:28.432
And then he came back
on the phone and said,

53:28.433 --> 53:29.480
"Well, I don't know much."

53:29.481 --> 53:30.871
My sister Judy would know more,

53:30.874 --> 53:32.542
you can call her tomorrow,

53:32.543 --> 53:34.023
but I think what
you really should do

53:34.024 --> 53:35.669
"is talk to Bill's
granddaughter."

53:35.671 --> 53:39.507
And I said, "But Bill
doesn't have a granddaughter!"

53:39.508 --> 53:40.588
He said, "No, but he does,"

53:40.592 --> 53:43.012
and I said, "Well,
he had only one child",

53:43.013 --> 53:44.761
Fred, who was gay,
and that was it,"

53:44.763 --> 53:46.519
as if I would know
better than the family.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.175
And Eric said, "That is true",

53:48.183 --> 53:49.623
he did have a son
Fred who was gay,

53:49.624 --> 53:52.808
"but Fred had a daughter."

53:52.813 --> 53:54.483
When I first heard those words,

53:54.484 --> 53:57.525
"You should look for
Bill's granddaughter,"

53:57.526 --> 54:00.526
I feel like I saw
a movie marquee,

54:00.529 --> 54:03.279
and it said,
"The Heir to Batman."

54:05.159 --> 54:07.994
And it made me feel
like this might be

54:07.995 --> 54:12.205
a bigger story than
anybody realized.

54:12.207 --> 54:14.667
The next day, I spoke with Judy.

54:14.668 --> 54:15.877
Judy was the one who told me

54:15.878 --> 54:17.628
that her name was Athena.

54:17.629 --> 54:18.969
The best she
could do was give me

54:18.972 --> 54:22.508
her last known state, Florida,

54:22.509 --> 54:23.718
so I was back to square one,

54:23.719 --> 54:27.259
looking for an heir that
we did not know existed.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.020
I did not find an Athena Finger

54:29.021 --> 54:30.056
in the Florida directory,

54:30.058 --> 54:33.098
so I wasn't even sure
that that was accurate,

54:33.103 --> 54:34.900
so I ended up looking online

54:34.901 --> 54:36.227
for any mention of her,

54:36.231 --> 54:38.775
and I found record
of her wedding.

54:38.776 --> 54:41.066
She married a man
named Zaido Cruz.

54:41.069 --> 54:43.569
So I found mention
of a Zaido Cruz

54:43.572 --> 54:46.699
on the website of a drummer

54:46.700 --> 54:48.788
whose name was Lance,
if I'm not mistaken.

54:48.789 --> 54:50.115
And I emailed Lance and said,

54:50.120 --> 54:51.208
"Is this the Zaido Cruz

54:51.209 --> 54:53.205
who's married to Athena Finger?"

54:53.207 --> 54:54.747
And he said... he wrote back,

54:54.750 --> 54:56.080
and I never spoke with him,

54:56.084 --> 54:58.004
but this is the voice
that I heard, he's like,

54:58.005 --> 55:00.463
"Yeah, man, hey,
dude, I know Zaido!

55:00.464 --> 55:01.589
Yeah, he's in my band!"

55:01.590 --> 55:03.190
or "I've played with
him, we've jammed",

55:03.191 --> 55:05.179
and you should
totally look him up,

55:05.180 --> 55:06.927
and you should find
them and, you know,

55:06.929 --> 55:08.429
"Athena should be easy to find!"

55:08.430 --> 55:09.470
And I said, "How's that?"

55:09.473 --> 55:10.943
And he said, "Well,
just look her up"

55:10.944 --> 55:12.141
on her Myspace page."

55:12.142 --> 55:15.102
In 2007, I was not
thinking Myspace

55:15.103 --> 55:16.982
or Facebook or
social media at all.

55:16.983 --> 55:19.150
So that was a revelation,
so thanks, Lance!

55:19.151 --> 55:22.859
So I looked Athena
up on Myspace,

55:22.861 --> 55:26.280
and when I found the
only Athena Finger there,

55:26.281 --> 55:29.121
the first thing I saw
was a photo of a dog,

55:29.122 --> 55:33.537
and the caption was,
"My Dog, Bruce Wayne."

55:33.539 --> 55:35.456
That was a fist pump moment.

55:35.457 --> 55:36.807
I don't think I
literally stood up

55:36.808 --> 55:38.626
and did a fist pump,

55:38.627 --> 55:39.917
that's maybe not my character,

55:39.920 --> 55:42.050
but in my mind I
was doing somersaults

55:42.051 --> 55:45.127
and throwing the football down

55:45.133 --> 55:46.473
and doing a dance
in the end zone.

55:46.474 --> 55:48.008
That was my moment.

55:48.011 --> 55:49.178
So I had that moment before,

55:49.179 --> 55:50.429
I had that moment with Charles,

55:50.430 --> 55:51.970
I had that moment with Lyn,

55:51.974 --> 55:55.184
but those things filled in gaps.

55:55.185 --> 55:57.765
They didn't completely
change the story.

56:01.817 --> 56:06.445
We are en route to
see Athena Finger,

56:06.446 --> 56:10.656
the only heir to Bill Finger.

56:10.659 --> 56:11.889
This would be a big shake-up.

56:11.890 --> 56:14.995
If the credit line
to Batman was changed

56:14.997 --> 56:17.997
after 72 years,
that would be a big deal,

56:18.000 --> 56:19.540
and that would
actually be a first.

56:19.543 --> 56:21.462
I can't think of
another comics character

56:21.463 --> 56:23.801
whose credit line
has been changed.

56:24.798 --> 56:27.088
- Hello... hey!
- Hey!

56:27.092 --> 56:28.470
- How are you?
- How are you?

56:28.471 --> 56:30.138
- Good, how are you?
- Good!

56:30.139 --> 56:32.677
- And here's Bruce Wayne!
- That's Bruce Wayne!

56:32.681 --> 56:33.931
How you doing?

56:35.350 --> 56:37.685
I found out about Bill Finger

56:37.686 --> 56:40.306
and his association with Batman

56:40.314 --> 56:41.480
at an early age,

56:41.481 --> 56:46.027
and I knew that my father
was excited and thrilled

56:46.028 --> 56:48.157
about what his
father had created

56:48.158 --> 56:49.695
with the Batman storyline,

56:49.698 --> 56:53.488
and how he made it
what we love today.

56:53.493 --> 56:55.745
Marc had found me,

56:55.746 --> 56:58.366
and he explained
what he had been doing

56:58.373 --> 57:00.583
and shared a bunch
of information

57:00.584 --> 57:02.212
that he had found
that I didn't know

57:02.213 --> 57:04.800
about Bill's family
and things like that.

57:04.801 --> 57:07.666
She said to me, you know,

57:07.674 --> 57:09.553
"I never knew my grandfather."

57:09.554 --> 57:11.051
I was born two
years after he died,

57:11.053 --> 57:13.222
so you could probably
tell me more about him

57:13.223 --> 57:15.890
than I can tell you,
but I'm very interested

57:15.891 --> 57:17.681
"in hearing what
you have to say."

57:17.684 --> 57:18.993
Bill used to keep copious notes.

57:18.994 --> 57:21.732
He had gimmick books
where he would jot down

57:21.733 --> 57:23.520
an idea that he
would use in the future,

57:23.523 --> 57:26.113
- and a lot of it was...
- It was kind of exciting,

57:26.114 --> 57:28.819
but it also was upsetting.

57:28.820 --> 57:31.864
It brought up a lot
of this old stuff

57:31.865 --> 57:34.445
that had been going on before...
Around my father's death

57:34.451 --> 57:36.160
and around my
grandfather's death,

57:36.161 --> 57:39.705
and just how everything
was not really

57:39.706 --> 57:41.246
in its proper place.

57:41.249 --> 57:46.045
I told you that I found
an interview with your dad.

57:46.046 --> 57:47.755
- Yes.
- And I have it.

57:47.756 --> 57:49.546
Oh, you have it!

57:49.549 --> 57:52.176
He had to write a lot of stories

57:52.177 --> 57:53.847
in order to make
any kind of money.

57:53.848 --> 57:56.595
He would get together

57:56.598 --> 57:58.768
with a couple of
the other writers...

57:58.769 --> 57:59.887
And I didn't know yet

57:59.893 --> 58:03.104
that there was so much
trauma in the family.

58:03.105 --> 58:04.645
It wasn't just a story of a girl

58:04.648 --> 58:06.268
who never knew her grandfather.

58:06.274 --> 58:07.524
It was also a story of a girl

58:07.525 --> 58:10.897
who had issues with her father.

58:10.904 --> 58:13.739
I haven't seen my
dad in, like, forever.

58:17.244 --> 58:19.203
My parents split when
I was three and a half,

58:19.204 --> 58:21.664
so I didn't grow up with my dad.

58:21.665 --> 58:22.705
I only got to see him

58:22.708 --> 58:24.917
maybe a couple times a year.

58:24.918 --> 58:27.248
It was really like,
if we went to New York,

58:27.254 --> 58:28.504
we would go to the restaurant

58:28.505 --> 58:30.506
that he was working
at and have dinner,

58:30.507 --> 58:33.047
or he might come
up to Massachusetts

58:33.051 --> 58:34.760
and spend a couple days.

58:34.761 --> 58:36.811
It wasn't like I
had extended amounts

58:36.812 --> 58:38.805
of time with him,

58:38.807 --> 58:41.517
which kind of sucked,
because I only had him

58:41.518 --> 58:43.808
for such a short amount of time.

58:46.064 --> 58:48.733
I was married six years.

58:48.734 --> 58:50.863
I just understood
that he was bisexual

58:50.864 --> 58:52.701
from the day that I met him,

58:52.702 --> 58:54.526
and it wasn't a situation

58:54.531 --> 58:57.408
that needed to be spoken of.

58:57.409 --> 59:00.159
It was something
that we both understood

59:00.162 --> 59:02.496
and accepted.

59:02.497 --> 59:06.417
I learned that Fred
was HIV positive

59:06.418 --> 59:09.048
the summer after I
was in the fourth grade,

59:09.049 --> 59:11.835
so that's, what, 10?

59:11.840 --> 59:14.630
I spent a week with
him during the summer,

59:14.634 --> 59:18.512
and he and I were at
the beach in Long Island,

59:18.513 --> 59:21.223
and he's like, "I
got to talk to you."

59:21.224 --> 59:24.435
So he was explaining,

59:24.436 --> 59:25.596
"This is what's going on,

59:25.604 --> 59:28.324
and we don't know
how long I have."

59:30.150 --> 59:33.027
And then when he
came to visit us

59:33.028 --> 59:34.698
right before he passed away,

59:34.699 --> 59:37.486
he was teeny-tiny,
just skin and bones.

59:37.491 --> 59:40.241
I mean, he was down to nothing.

59:42.454 --> 59:43.624
When he came to visit

59:43.625 --> 59:46.040
near the real end of his life,

59:46.041 --> 59:48.334
we asked him not to leave.

59:50.170 --> 59:51.960
How did he respond,
what did he say?

59:51.963 --> 59:53.153
He said, "I have to go back."

59:53.154 --> 59:55.424
I have to die in New York."

59:59.721 --> 01:00:03.390
That year was rough.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:06.227
Being 15 at the time,
not quite an adult,

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:08.558
but had to deal
with real adult issues,

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:12.358
and I was very angry
about a lot of things.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:17.947
And then, when he passed
away two months later,

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.407
I wasn't included,
I wasn't informed,

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.326
I wasn't...

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:25.577
I just was excluded
from everything.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.959
I was really upset about it,
very angry about it

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.578
because I was his only child

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:31.754
and I should have been
there and I wasn't.

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:36.045
AIDS was still very new

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:40.344
and stigmatized

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.755
and scary.

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:45.099
There was a lot of comfort

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.687
being with people who are
experiencing the same thing

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:54.316
and he created
a family of friends

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:57.607
that were there
when it got tough.

01:00:57.612 --> 01:01:01.115
So New York was where
he really had to be,

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.486
he felt.

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:10.291
I still don't have closure.

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:12.422
I was excluded from everything.

01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:15.796
I really was.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.087
Sorry.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:23.804
I wasn't even there
to spread his ashes.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:35.816
I don't even know where he is.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:45.159
When Marc Nobleman called me,

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.370
I said to him, "I'm not sure
that this is beneficial"

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:51.713
to our family welfare,

01:01:51.714 --> 01:01:53.998
"for this to be
brought up again."

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:58.505
We tried our hardest to do
something about it in the past.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:02.506
I mean, I love Fred and
I wanted credit for Bill,

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:07.097
but we had spent years trying
to get the credit for him.

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:12.305
Fred really just wanted
his father to have recognition.

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:15.189
It was very important
for Fred to validate

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:18.690
the existence of his father
and his artistic talents

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:21.654
and he gave it his best.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:24.565
I never went to DC,
Fred went to DC alone,

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.952
but I understand the way
that it was dealt with.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.623
They treated you
like you were family

01:02:29.624 --> 01:02:32.665
but gave you nothing
in return for it.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:36.085
Anything to make you
feel comfortable

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:40.296
but they were keeping
everything for themselves.

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:41.798
After about the third attorney,

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.260
Fred just said, "We just need to
stop this, Bonnie, and go on."

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:51.391
So Fred never got to see
his father get, on the screen,

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.644
"Co-creator William Finger."

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:58.105
The tradition in our
family, unfortunately,

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:00.858
is being excluded
from everything.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.405
There is this sense
of not being acknowledged,

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:09.696
of what I'm part of
and who my family was.

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:10.933
I remember in the third grade

01:03:10.934 --> 01:03:14.079
we had to do this
book on our lives,

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:17.251
so I included the information
about my grandfather

01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:19.631
and his involvement
with Batman and stuff

01:03:19.632 --> 01:03:21.088
and people wouldn't believe me

01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:22.756
or they questioned me.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:25.047
So for a long time
I kept quiet about it,

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:27.101
especially after my
father passed away.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:32.349
I always kind of referred to
it as, like, the dark cloud

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.688
that hung over my head

01:03:33.689 --> 01:03:36.145
because it was
something that I knew

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.436
that needed to be corrected,

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.275
just didn't know
which avenue to take.

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:43.856
So it was always, like, looming.

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:48.580
I wasted no time
in telling Athena

01:03:48.581 --> 01:03:50.735
that I would be
disappointed in myself

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:53.460
if I didn't tell you
that this is your birthright

01:03:53.461 --> 01:03:55.995
and I thought for a year
that nobody could ever do

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.539
anything about this credit line,

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:58.920
and I'm going to
write this book,

01:03:58.921 --> 01:04:02.128
but if we want a shot at
changing that credit line,

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.505
"it has to be you."

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.965
I had been told for a long time

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.626
that it was kind of a dead issue

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.304
and I shouldn't really pursue it

01:04:08.305 --> 01:04:09.683
and I should just let it be,

01:04:09.684 --> 01:04:11.805
and it would take tons of money

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:13.386
and, like, all
these other excuses

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:17.144
of why I shouldn't pursue
adding Bill's credit.

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.765
I encouraged Athena
to contact DC

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:24.276
and at first she was
not keen on that.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:27.357
She was a young mom
with a career and a life

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:29.393
and she said, "Of course
I've thought about this",

01:04:29.394 --> 01:04:30.578
but this is too daunting.

01:04:30.579 --> 01:04:32.695
"I mean, where do
you even start?"

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:35.621
It took some
convincing of Marc to,

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.539
"Athena, go, talk to them.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.167
Call this person."

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:41.837
I'm like, "Eh, I don't know."

01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:43.506
Like, I was really hesitant.

01:04:43.507 --> 01:04:45.214
I didn't know what to expect.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:49.472
But as soon as I spoke to them,
they invited me up to come

01:04:49.473 --> 01:04:51.299
and take a tour of the office

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:52.763
when it was still
in New York City,

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:54.973
which was very cool.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.353
So then after that,
we went to the movie premiere

01:04:57.354 --> 01:04:58.649
for "The Dark Knight"

01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:02.015
and did the whole red carpet
and then the after-party.

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:03.899
It was just like, "Woo!"

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.109
It was awesome.

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:08.198
It was a really amazing scene
seeing all these people

01:05:08.199 --> 01:05:09.736
and it was like Hollywood.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:12.324
Like, it was so
cool to be there.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.235
Like, "Oh my gosh,
I'm a part of this."

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:17.210
And then they just kept
inviting me to things.

01:05:17.211 --> 01:05:19.955
You know, just really
accepting and, like,

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.166
"Please, join in."

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.837
PR people got in touch with me

01:05:22.838 --> 01:05:25.376
and informed me that they were
going to pay for the room

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.880
and fly me and
my friend out here.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:30.592
I get to play movie star
for a little while.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.643
The whole thing was very fast.

01:05:32.644 --> 01:05:34.887
Finding the heir and then DC

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:37.889
being quite cooperative
about the whole process.

01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:42.020
I was very surprised
by how that all happened.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:43.730
They were very generous

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:47.734
and they did send me
a bonus sum of money

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:48.855
for the movie.

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:51.071
It said, you know,
"This is," you know,

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:53.031
"for his contributions."

01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:56.412
You know, "We're so glad that
you're part of the family now."

01:05:56.413 --> 01:06:00.414
So I was like,
"Oh, this is nice."

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:01.915
The term "Thank you payment,"

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:05.166
it's a case where a
company writes a writer

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.170
or an artist a check

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:08.509
and says, "We're giving you this"

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:10.465
because you contributed
something or other

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:12.006
"to this character."

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.010
I guess that's the kind of
thing that the companies

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:16.762
have wanted to do
in the last few decades

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:19.521
as the things got to be
really big business.

01:06:19.522 --> 01:06:20.767
There's so much money involved

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.938
and nobody wants
a lot of lawsuits.

01:06:22.939 --> 01:06:25.017
So it just makes a lot of sense

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:26.443
giving a few thousand dollars,

01:06:26.444 --> 01:06:29.610
$10,000 or $20,000 to somebody.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.445
You know, somewhere between

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:32.856
creator credit and hush money.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:36.204
The Bill Finger story
has a number of imperatives.

01:06:36.205 --> 01:06:38.911
There's the cultural
side of this,

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.959
there is the moral side of this,

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.825
there is the
financial side of this.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:45.125
How much is Batman worth now?

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:46.286
A gob!

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:47.404
What are you talking about?

01:06:47.405 --> 01:06:49.625
It's movies,
it's toys, it's pajamas,

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:52.257
it's cartoons, it's comi...

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:53.717
I mean, it's a vernacular.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.968
You say "Batman" to a grandma...

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:57.260
This is the greatest brand...

01:06:57.263 --> 01:07:00.098
"Batman," grandma
knows through attrition.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:01.769
When you open a comic
book, there it says,

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:02.857
"Created by Bob Kane."

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.398
When you see the movies, it
says, "Created by Bob Kane."

01:07:05.399 --> 01:07:06.936
Correcting that is something

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.149
that terrified everybody,
I think, for decades

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.900
because correcting that
isn't just a simple matter

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:15.614
of putting Bill Finger's
name onto Batman.

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:17.485
It also opens up the floodgates

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.992
to a massive conglomerate

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:22.621
for potential revenue tapping.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:26.582
DC Comics is one spoke
in the massive operation

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:27.834
that is Warner Brothers,

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:29.185
which is underneath Time Warner.

01:07:29.187 --> 01:07:31.587
So, I mean, it's a huge
media company, of course,

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:34.258
and Batman is one of
the biggest money makers

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.677
in fiction, period.

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:40.806
So DC was under
the umbrella of Warner Brothers

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:43.137
but as soon as we got
to "The Dark Knight Rises,"

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.142
Warner Brothers
was really overseeing

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:47.688
all of the corporate side.

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:50.148
Which brings me into in 2012

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.278
when "The Dark Knight
Rises" came out

01:07:52.279 --> 01:07:54.236
and I got an email
saying, you know,

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:57.947
"We would like to have
you sign this document"

01:07:57.949 --> 01:08:00.199
so that we can cut you a check,

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:02.201
"so sign it and please return."

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:03.791
But the gist of it
was they wanted me

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:06.748
to terminate my rights
to any kind of claim.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.539
They wanted me to close the door

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:11.586
on Bill getting any
kind of credit.

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:14.217
They were trying
to make me quiet.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:17.926
Yeah, right?

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:19.417
- So is this for you?
- Yes, please.

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.487
Alex or Alex...

01:08:20.488 --> 01:08:21.846
- Alex.
- Okay.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.557
I had this blind faith all along

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:26.228
that I would see the book
through to publication.

01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:28.767
Although, believe me,
there were plenty of roadblocks

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.060
and obstacles.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.104
So getting the book out
was a huge accomplishment;

01:08:32.104 --> 01:08:35.649
Just to see any book through
is something I'm proud of.

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:37.321
The book came out in 2012

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:40.573
and with it came a
chance to talk about Bill

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:43.154
in an arena that was
even bigger than a book.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.870
Secret identities
are for superheroes,

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:46.251
not the guys behind them.

01:08:46.252 --> 01:08:48.787
I had the chance
to do a TED Talk.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.211
Bill Finger's life
ended tragically,

01:08:51.212 --> 01:08:53.795
but his story isn't over yet.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.505
I was interviewed on NPR.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.296
Now if you've seen
"The Dark Knight Rises,"

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.594
the name not there
is that of Bill Finger.

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:03.925
I had the chance to go
on Kevin Smith's podcast.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:06.519
Does he have heirs,
is there a family?

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.267
Yeah, well, that
was the biggest, uh,

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.769
discovery of my research.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.810
Legally I can't do
anything to change this,

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:12.874
but she can.

01:09:12.875 --> 01:09:14.733
She is Batgirl
for heaven's sakes.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:18.194
When you have somebody
who's speaking that loudly,

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:21.776
advocating that loudly
on behalf of a cause,

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:23.908
something is going to get done.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.788
It incited this bubbling
movement, you know,

01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:28.328
where suddenly
you started hearing

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.871
more and more about Bill Finger.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.462
He had no Batman of his own,

01:09:31.462 --> 01:09:33.288
but I think you are
Bill Finger's Batman,

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.461
for heaven's sakes.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:36.341
You're the one that's
going to find him justice.

01:09:37.095 --> 01:09:38.670
I kept talking
about raising an army

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:39.966
and groundswell of support,

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:41.776
but I never actually
stopped to think about,

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:42.957
"Well, those are people too."

01:09:43.062 --> 01:09:45.600
So that did start to really
become my driving force

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.977
was I can't let
all these people down.

01:09:47.978 --> 01:09:50.475
So I was doing some
groundwork on one level,

01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:52.008
but we needed
something else to happen

01:09:52.013 --> 01:09:53.188
on another level.

01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:57.073
It had been a year

01:09:57.074 --> 01:10:00.318
since Marc Nobleman's
book had been out.

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:02.991
So more people were
starting to contact me,

01:10:02.992 --> 01:10:05.830
"Are you really
Bill's granddaughter?"

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.549
And this is her
first convention ever.

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:25.721
I brought Athena
into the conventions.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:27.912
Whether we're talking about
a Wizard World convention,

01:10:27.913 --> 01:10:31.017
or San Diego,
or the New York Comic Con,

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:32.848
I brought her into
a number that year,

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:35.522
to meet the fans
and to get her out

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:38.859
from those curtains that
she was staying behind,

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.694
to meet other people.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:44.025
I had never been to a
formal convention before,

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:45.071
any of that stuff.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.703
So I did my first panel,
I was so nervous.

01:10:47.704 --> 01:10:50.331
I'm like, "I don't even know
what we're talking about."

01:10:50.332 --> 01:10:52.708
The fans would ask her
questions and she would say,

01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:54.707
"I'm learning about
these things from you."

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:57.959
She was learning things
about her grandfather

01:10:57.962 --> 01:11:00.714
and the legacy and
exactly what Bill did

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:03.795
from all of us
because she'd grown up

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:06.051
with it being this thing
to be uncomfortable about.

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:08.680
Was it not just this wonderful
thing to tell everybody,

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.471
"Hey, my granddad was
one of the co-creators

01:11:10.472 --> 01:11:12.026
"of Batman," when
you were growing up?

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:14.004
Well, you would think
it would be a great thing,

01:11:14.005 --> 01:11:16.475
but, um, growing up,
no, it wasn't.

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:19.231
I shied away from
talking about it.

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:20.233
As I got older...

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.991
She's not eager to talk
to the crowd herself,

01:11:22.992 --> 01:11:24.946
she's eager to get
the information out,

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.367
so she's doing it anyway.

01:11:26.368 --> 01:11:28.575
And I think that's a bit heroic.

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:30.366
Part of Athena's
grieving process

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:32.119
is going to Comic
Con and talking

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:36.416
about her grandfather
and her father.

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:39.085
It's wonderful to see.

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:41.755
And he would be
right there with her

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:45.006
because it was something
Fred wanted for his father.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:46.049
- Okay.
- There we go.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:49.679
There was so much
support from people.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.680
They really, really
wanted to see Bill's name

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:55.103
attached to Batman,
as it should be.

01:11:55.104 --> 01:11:57.941
Comic book fans, their
fights are on the page.

01:11:57.942 --> 01:12:00.609
They don't bring it into
the real world or anything.

01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:03.358
But the fights that
they do get involved in,

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:04.778
it's not fisticuffs,

01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:06.069
it's battles for what is right.

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:07.072
And how could they not?

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:08.583
Because the characters
they read about

01:12:08.584 --> 01:12:10.120
all the time do the same thing.

01:12:10.121 --> 01:12:12.077
Those are your role
models on the page.

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:14.287
So while Bill
didn't train people

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:16.456
to fight for him
after he was dead,

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:17.887
you have a bunch
of people who read

01:12:17.892 --> 01:12:19.842
and were influenced by
the work of Bill Finger,

01:12:19.843 --> 01:12:23.755
like this is what's right,
this is what's just.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:27.006
So that's really where I
got a lot of pressure from,

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.009
was from the fans.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.179
"Why isn't this happening?"

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:30.637
Why isn't his name attached?

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:31.888
What's happening?

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.308
Why... what, what, what?

01:12:33.309 --> 01:12:34.427
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:35.475
How, how, how?

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:36.636
"Do, do, do."

01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:38.854
And so I knew that

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:41.645
something was going
to come out of it.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:46.149
In 2014, WonderCon was
held in Anaheim, California,

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:48.989
and there was this Batman panel.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:52.617
And an audience member
gets up to the microphone

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.368
and asks this question about,

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.160
"Will Bill Finger get credit?"

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:58.623
And there's just
silence up there.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.004
One member of the
panel says, "Crickets."

01:13:01.005 --> 01:13:05.088
And a person working for DC,

01:13:05.089 --> 01:13:06.506
Larry Ganem,

01:13:06.507 --> 01:13:08.757
gets up and he says that,

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:12.345
"We're all good with
Finger and his family."

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:17.016
And that was when, "Okay,
we've got to reply to this."

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:19.688
Athena and I put
the statement together that,

01:13:19.689 --> 01:13:24.816
"No, things are not all good
with the Finger family."

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:26.857
Timing is everything.

01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:29.696
75th anniversary
of Batman's coming up,

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:31.697
it was the hundred
year anniversary

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:33.529
of my grandfather's birth,

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:36.703
it was the 25th
anniversary of the '89 movie.

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:40.665
Like all this stuff was
coming together in 2014.

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:43.496
I called Athena
and we had a huge cry

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:45.670
over Fred being gone.

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:48.381
And then we discussed it.

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:50.512
Maybe it's time that Bill Finger

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:53.469
got the recognition he deserved.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:58.725
And that's when
it became a fight.

01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:01.436
I felt that the
timing was right.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:04.437
I knew it was
either now or never.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.734
And I think I
called my sister first.

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:10.395
We have different fathers,
she's older than I am.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:13.374
She felt like it was
really a burden in her life

01:14:13.375 --> 01:14:17.494
to have inherited this
controversy, basically.

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:19.615
Knowing that I was the
only one that could do it

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:20.752
was a huge burden.

01:14:20.753 --> 01:14:24.668
So it really... I wanted
to get it finished

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:27.087
knowing that I
only had one chance.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:30.674
Being an attorney, I... I was able

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:34.175
to assess what resources
we had and didn't have.

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:37.638
So she contacted me
because she was seeking

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.475
a copyright attorney to help her

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.226
with the situation.

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:45.309
The copyright law says

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:49.609
that when two people
create parts of something

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:51.987
that are intended to be merged

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.488
into an inseparable work,

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.157
then it's a joint work

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:59.658
and each of them is a co-owner.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:04.791
So coming into this, one of
the most commonly cited facts

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:07.460
of Batman lore is that Bob Kane

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.671
negotiated a contract
in which he would be

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:12.132
the sole creator
in perpetuity of Batman,

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:14.889
he would be the only
name listed as creator.

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:17.345
The only thing I've always
gotten from the people

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.216
that I have talked to at DC is,

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:21.061
"We know what
your grandfather did,"

01:15:21.062 --> 01:15:22.937
we wish we could
put his name on it,

01:15:22.938 --> 01:15:25.935
"but we can't because of
the contracts that we have."

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.648
This infamous Bob Kane contract

01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:30.689
has never been
publicly disclosed,

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.360
as expected.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.490
I mean, these are big
characters, big companies,

01:15:34.491 --> 01:15:36.278
they have no obligation so share

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:39.367
all of their contents
of their vault.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:42.408
If any company had an agreement

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:44.923
that clearly spelled
out their rights

01:15:44.924 --> 01:15:48.084
and that shut down
a copyright claim,

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:51.755
it seems to me that
they would produce that.

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:53.586
I don't know why you wouldn't.

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:55.471
It might be hearsay,
it might be a myth

01:15:55.472 --> 01:15:58.968
that DC Comics is perpetuating

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:01.097
because it helps them.

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:02.348
Or it might be real

01:16:02.349 --> 01:16:05.977
and the original source was Bob.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.857
That is another
interesting thing

01:16:07.858 --> 01:16:10.355
about the copyright law
that was in play here.

01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:11.647
Somebody is simply claiming

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.860
that they are the sole
author when they're not,

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:15.861
that's not really...
That doesn't really do it.

01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:20.033
So then you look at what
did Bill Finger contribute?

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:22.702
Did that make him a joint author

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:24.829
or joint owner of the work?

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.710
Marc Tyler Nobleman
sort of taking this case on,

01:16:27.711 --> 01:16:30.126
delving into the research,

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:31.586
and then, of course, Bob Kane,

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.957
you know, eventually
kind of helped

01:16:32.958 --> 01:16:35.785
by talking about Bill's
contribution himself.

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:47.060
Um, that was very important.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:48.561
If poor Athena,
like, had to start

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:50.232
with that threshold issue,

01:16:50.233 --> 01:16:52.651
that just would have been
really, really difficult.

01:16:52.652 --> 01:16:56.236
I mean, this is a huge
entertainment company

01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:59.567
with an entire department
of, you know, attorneys.

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.953
And then there's,
you know, Athena Finger.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:08.206
Sadly, for people
who are creating stories

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.457
about superheroes
who are selfless

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.168
and saving people's lives,

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:14.669
there's not a whole lot

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:16.512
of generosity going on here.

01:17:16.513 --> 01:17:20.337
You've got creators fighting
a company over a character.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:24.597
And, you know, it's a classic
David and Goliath story.

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:28.434
And in these cases, usually
the underdog doesn't win.

01:17:28.435 --> 01:17:31.805
As teenagers in
Cleveland in 1933,

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:33.523
these two boys
signed a piece of paper

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:35.530
that, in effect,
sold their rights,

01:17:35.531 --> 01:17:37.106
and they sold them for $130.

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:38.570
Well, they were just kids

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.611
and they were so anxious
to get published,

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:42.124
so anxious for recognition,

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:44.784
that they signed away
their copyright.

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:46.655
Superman became what Superman is

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:50.622
because of DC building Superman

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:52.750
to the industry that it is.

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:54.794
But still, Siegel and Shuster

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:57.255
deserved a lot
more than they got.

01:17:57.256 --> 01:18:00.626
You know, they made
a couple of efforts

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:03.845
to get greater credit.

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:05.676
In their 1947 suit,

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:09.021
Siegel and Shuster did not
get ownership of Superman.

01:18:09.022 --> 01:18:11.768
They did get $94,000 more,

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:13.229
but <i>National Periodical</i>

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:15.730
then owned Superman and Superboy

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:17.942
and fired Siegel and Shuster.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.033
The creators of Superman

01:18:19.034 --> 01:18:23.818
first sued over credit in 1947.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:27.368
They were still working
for the company at the time.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.499
So they lost the lawsuit,
they lost their jobs,

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.166
and the company
that became DC Comics

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:34.917
took their name off Superman.

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:37.629
In 1963, Siegel and Shuster

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.170
started another suit,

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:40.933
this one to win
back the copyright

01:18:40.934 --> 01:18:44.175
when it came up
for renewal in 1966.

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:45.348
The court finding,

01:18:45.349 --> 01:18:48.676
"Superman belongs to
<i>National Periodical."</i>

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:52.018
Long story short
is Superman has been

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:54.559
the subject of litigation
almost from the beginning,

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:58.024
and it's been going on
for decades at this point.

01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:00.605
And most of the major
players are gone,

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:04.197
so it's passed on to
the second generation.

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:06.778
When you're dealing
with something so big,

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:08.334
the stakes are
big on either side

01:19:08.335 --> 01:19:10.495
of a challenge, of a contest.

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:13.036
And, you know,
the Superman situation

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.920
would not have instilled
a lot of confidence

01:19:14.921 --> 01:19:17.167
that you can win.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:20.919
To push this type
of a claim further,

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:24.550
you have to have the means

01:19:24.551 --> 01:19:27.387
and, frankly,
the money to do it.

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:30.388
And no single person, really,

01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:33.231
even if you had
multi-millions in the bank,

01:19:33.232 --> 01:19:35.895
would want to go
through that risk.

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:38.476
We would have been
possibly investing

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:40.566
five to ten years of our life

01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:42.026
entering into a litigation

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:45.777
against a multi-national
corporation.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:49.741
Frankly, it was my strategy
to not go down that road,

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:53.079
but to, of course, make
it appear that we would.

01:19:54.141 --> 01:19:56.249
We're going back so far in time.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:59.710
If we're going to assume
that all of these things

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:02.505
that people said in
the press were true

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:05.256
about Bill Finger and
about his contribution

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:06.889
and the way it went down,

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:12.135
then they each own half
of Batman as a whole.

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:15.101
There could be an argument
from the corporation's side

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:19.397
that it's not a joint work
because he was employee.

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:22.025
I've never heard of any document

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:23.896
that said that he was.

01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:26.072
I never heard of
a document that said

01:20:26.073 --> 01:20:28.656
he was working under
a work for hire.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.447
So, here's step one and step two

01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:31.591
and step three and step four

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:34.329
and all this leads
to, hypothetically,

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.247
yeah, you take it back.

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:38.288
That's the leverage
of the copyright law,

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.589
to actually allow
people to take it back

01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:42.756
or to put that large corporation

01:20:42.757 --> 01:20:45.295
in the position of
having to renegotiate

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:48.299
their royalties
or whatever it is.

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.722
I do believe that there
was risk on both sides

01:20:50.723 --> 01:20:55.516
and we had highlighted
enough of that risk

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:57.807
to get them to talk to us,

01:20:57.811 --> 01:20:59.561
and that was the goal.

01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:03.145
I didn't imagine that I would

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:05.610
actually be at
the final meeting,

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.611
but it took place in July,

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:10.073
it was closed door negotiations,

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:14.577
and it was a big deal on
so many different levels.

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.579
Somebody has a goal and
somebody else has a goal

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:19.248
and how do you negotiate

01:21:19.249 --> 01:21:20.919
and maybe not
make everybody happy,

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.128
but make everyone
not horribly miserable.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:25.409
I don't know if they could tell,

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:28.007
but I was very nervous.

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.678
We really wanted to get credit,

01:21:29.679 --> 01:21:33.136
but we didn't know which
way this was going to go,

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:34.514
we really didn't.

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.252
There came a point where
I wasn't leading the charge

01:21:40.253 --> 01:21:41.650
anymore because I'm not family,

01:21:41.651 --> 01:21:44.857
and there's only so far I
can go without being family.

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:47.068
Hey, Raf-bear.

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.397
- Good to see you, boy.
- Hello.

01:21:48.398 --> 01:21:49.854
- How's my favorite fuzzball?
- Good.

01:21:49.855 --> 01:21:50.855
Yeah?

01:21:50.856 --> 01:21:53.156
So in the summer of 2015,

01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:54.367
everything was building.

01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:55.368
I could feel it.

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:57.328
And in September,

01:21:57.329 --> 01:22:00.209
it felt like we were getting
to that tipping point.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:05.336
It was September
18th, it was a Friday.

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:06.627
I travel a lot,

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.010
but I happened to
be home that day,

01:22:08.014 --> 01:22:09.590
In fact, I was home alone.

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:13.177
And by chance I had
this set of things

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:15.888
I had to do for the day,
and, very atypically,

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:19.225
I finished it
pretty much before noon.

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:21.306
And the tweets and the emails

01:22:21.311 --> 01:22:23.111
and the blog posts
and the Facebook posts

01:22:23.112 --> 01:22:24.435
started to pour in.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.940
And I had a couple
hours to myself

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:29.527
where I was just
catatonic almost.

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:31.908
The first person in
my family to come home

01:22:31.909 --> 01:22:33.364
was my daughter.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.408
Did you see it?

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:38.160
Yeah!

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:39.495
What did it say?

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:41.996
"DC to give Bill
Finger official credit

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:46.249
on 'Batman'" versus, I think,
"'Superman' and 'Gotham'"?

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:47.420
Mm-hm.

01:22:47.421 --> 01:22:49.261
They're giving him the credit?

01:22:49.262 --> 01:22:51.376
They're giving him credit now.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.925
What?

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:53.966
What?

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:57.680
How did you do that?

01:22:57.681 --> 01:22:59.599
How did you do that?

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.979
"You did it, Marc, you got
justice for Bill Finger"

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:03.557
and righted a lifetime wrong!

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:05.062
"You are Batman for Bill!"

01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:06.481
That's Kevin Smith.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:08.652
There's quite a big difference
between me and Batman,

01:23:08.653 --> 01:23:10.779
but I'll accept that
as a nice compliment.

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:12.906
"Bill Finger getting
his justice."

01:23:12.907 --> 01:23:14.445
That's from Kevin Conroy,

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:15.988
who was the voice of Batman

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.788
since the beginning of
Batman: The Animated Series.

01:23:18.789 --> 01:23:21.285
"On my honeymoon
in Mexico from Ireland."

01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:22.408
Just saw the news.

01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:25.041
"Thrilled for you, Bill,
and the Finger family."

01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:27.032
But I'm pretty sure one
person who wasn't thrilled

01:23:27.033 --> 01:23:29.167
was his new bride,

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.380
whose new husband is
tweeting about Batman

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:32.798
on his honeymoon.

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:35.259
But thank you very much, Burke.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.720
"DC Entertainment and
the family of Bill Finger"

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:38.739
are pleased to announce

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:40.169
that they have
reached an agreement

01:23:40.173 --> 01:23:43.353
that recognizes Mr. Finger's
significant contributions

01:23:43.354 --> 01:23:45.602
to the Batman
family of characters.

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:47.023
We are pleased to confirm today

01:23:47.024 --> 01:23:49.401
that Bill Finger will
be receiving credit

01:23:49.402 --> 01:23:52.028
in the Warner Brothers
television series 'Gotham'

01:23:52.029 --> 01:23:54.317
and in the forthcoming
motion picture,

01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:57.781
"'Batman v Superman:
Dawn of Justice.'"

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:03.866
Our goal was to get
Bill's name attached.

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:06.082
That's what we did.

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:07.833
We changed history.

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:14.008
But in 25 years of
writing Batman comics,

01:24:14.009 --> 01:24:16.007
1,500 stories in all,

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:18.049
including the first one,

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:20.350
Bill's name appeared
in a Batman comic

01:24:20.351 --> 01:24:23.057
as the co-creator,
or the original writer,

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:26.894
exactly zero times.

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.015
Because Bob Kane said...

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:30.439
I have often asked myself,

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:34.190
"Why has he been doing
this for all these years?"

01:24:34.194 --> 01:24:39.740
And I do believe he's
just passionate about it.

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:43.995
He does believe in the
causes that he writes about.

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:46.746
You're probably wondering
if I found any photos

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.788
of Bill Finger in the backyard

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:51.377
mowing the lawn
with his shirt off.

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:54.458
And the answer is
yes, yes, I did.

01:24:56.174 --> 01:24:57.967
You're welcome, ladies.

01:24:57.968 --> 01:24:59.968
The driving force though, still,

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:01.637
is to right a wrong

01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:04.056
and to try to stay
on that good side.

01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:06.066
So you can't see Bill
too well from where you are,

01:25:06.067 --> 01:25:07.357
but he's there in the shadows.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.895
Marc always strives for equality

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:12.315
and it's really his whole being,

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:13.566
I mean, that's him.

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.857
He's very brave,
he's a very brave person.

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:18.740
He really... if he thinks
that something is not fair,

01:25:18.741 --> 01:25:19.908
he will go for it.

01:25:19.909 --> 01:25:23.036
So I think that this is
not the end, to be honest.

01:25:23.037 --> 01:25:24.405
There's always
more to the story.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.249
I mean, what I always
say is that no story

01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:28.076
from history ends in a period.

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:29.707
They all end in a dot, dot, dot.

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:30.988
We're just waiting for someone

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.542
to find the next part.

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:43.602
Do you want to do
lashes as well?

01:25:43.603 --> 01:25:45.597
- Sure.
- Yeah?

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:47.599
Again, I'm going to be
on film and stuff,

01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:49.091
- so I want to...
- Yeah, we can add

01:25:49.092 --> 01:25:51.095
- the lashes if you like.
- Okay.

01:25:51.104 --> 01:25:53.731
So what are you
guys filming for?

01:25:53.732 --> 01:25:56.984
It's a documentary
about my grandfather.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.275
He was the original writer

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:00.988
and co-creator of Batman.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.369
- No kidding.
- Mm-hm.

01:26:02.370 --> 01:26:03.446
That is awesome.

01:26:14.127 --> 01:26:15.795
I don't have black socks.

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.597
Almost there.

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:36.745
All right, Alethia, tell me,

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.440
is it okay with the leather?

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:51.664
This is my tenth
Batman premiere,

01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.995
but it's very special
because this is the first time

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.210
that Bill Finger is
getting onscreen credit

01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:57.920
in a major motion picture

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:00.131
for his co-creation of Batman.

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:02.470
And that's very,
very exciting to me.

01:27:02.471 --> 01:27:04.757
It's amazing that
so many years later,

01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:07.471
we are now en route
with his granddaughters

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:10.099
and great-grandson
going to a premiere

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.940
in which his name finally is
going to be up on the screen.

01:27:12.941 --> 01:27:14.766
I'm very excited.

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.694
It was a curse in our lives.

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:24.864
Bill was unknown, unrespected.

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:27.324
My dad was in the same position.

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:31.035
I was trying to cope
with my father's death.

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:32.827
I'm hoping that I've broken that

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:35.081
by getting the closure for Bill,

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:38.544
for myself, and for my son,

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:40.045
so that we can move forward

01:27:40.046 --> 01:27:44.086
and not have this dark cloud

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:45.926
following us around.

01:27:51.224 --> 01:27:53.694
It's been ten years that
I've been telling this story,

01:27:53.695 --> 01:27:56.725
and to hear that Bill
died and was buried

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:58.730
in a pauper's grave,
in a potter's field,

01:27:58.732 --> 01:28:00.065
was devastating,

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:02.436
and that was the only
story that anybody knew.

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:09.448
Until I found two people
who both knew Fred,

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:10.741
Bill's son,

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.953
and who both told me
a different story.

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.630
So what these two people said

01:28:18.631 --> 01:28:20.877
was that Fred did come
forward after Bill died

01:28:20.879 --> 01:28:22.879
and just... he was not
there the day that he died,

01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.121
which is why he doesn't appear

01:28:24.124 --> 01:28:26.967
in the medical examiner report.

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.548
Fred had his father cremated,

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:31.013
and he was living
in Oregon at the time.

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:34.944
And he took the ashes
to the shoreline

01:28:34.945 --> 01:28:36.894
near where he lived.

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:40.064
Spread them on the sand

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:42.435
in the shape of a bat.

01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:48.405
And let the water come in
and wash it out to sea.

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:08.592
Have fun.

01:29:12.055 --> 01:29:15.474
Uh, one "Batman
v Superman" please?
