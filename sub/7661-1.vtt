When the editor
of "Playboy" told me

00:45.175 --> 00:46.524
I'd won Playmate of the Year

00:46.568 --> 00:48.135
the first thing out of my mouth

00:48.178 --> 00:51.094
was, "Are you sure?"

00:51.138 --> 00:53.531
[male #1]
Did your brother mind you
being in the magazine?

00:53.575 --> 00:55.751
[Dorothy]
I think, um,
my brother was a little shy

00:55.794 --> 00:57.753
because he has friends
who are 18 years old

00:57.796 --> 01:00.538
17 years old
who said that, you know

01:00.582 --> 01:02.540
"Hey, your sister's
in 'Playboy.'"

01:02.584 --> 01:03.976
But his friends..

01:04.019 --> 01:05.500
Well, I remember
when I came home

01:05.543 --> 01:07.241
to visit the family
and they came over

01:07.284 --> 01:09.156
and they said,
"I couldn't believe it.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.635
We saw you in 'Playboy.'"

01:10.679 --> 01:12.376
And they said,
"How'd you get in?"

01:12.420 --> 01:14.900
And, "It's so wonderful."

01:14.944 --> 01:16.989
And then he started thinking
that, you know

01:17.033 --> 01:19.035
that-that that is pretty neat.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.037
You know, my sister..

01:21.081 --> 01:23.344
"Playboy's" motto is,
"The girl next door."

01:23.387 --> 01:25.041
They look for girls
that are wholesome

01:25.085 --> 01:27.783
and fresh and young and naive.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.654
They look for all of that.

01:29.698 --> 01:32.918
So most of those girls
do, uh, have

01:32.962 --> 01:34.572
that type of background.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.139

01:36.183 --> 01:37.619

01:39.708 --> 01:41.101
It's perfection.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.059

01:43.103 --> 01:44.278

45:39.649 --> 45:41.695
- And what's your name?
- Snider.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.914
- Dorothy?
- Paul.

45:42.957 --> 45:44.089
Excuse us a second.

45:44.132 --> 45:46.265
Dorothy,
there's somebody, I, uh..

45:46.308 --> 45:50.530
- And what do you do?
- Uh, I'm her personal manager.

45:50.573 --> 45:53.315
Phil, say hello
to Dorothy Stratten.

45:53.359 --> 45:55.230
If he says say hello,
you say hello.

45:55.274 --> 45:57.624
Hello, Dorothy Stratten.
I'm Phil Wass.

45:57.667 --> 45:59.408
Hello.

45:59.452 --> 46:01.933
Phil produces movies, sometimes.

46:01.976 --> 46:04.544
Dorothy's our Miss August. We
are all very excited about her.

46:04.587 --> 46:06.502
Maybe if you play
your cards right, we might just

46:06.546 --> 46:08.548
might let you present her
in her film debut.

46:08.591 --> 46:11.551
- She's a very fine actress.
- Mr. Hefner--

46:11.594 --> 46:13.858
Don't worry. He doesn't know a
damn thing about acting, anyway.

46:13.901 --> 46:16.338
Excuse me.
I'll leave you two alone.

46:16.382 --> 46:19.559
Listen, I am doing a film
called "Ball Bearings."

46:19.602 --> 46:20.952
Maybe you'd like to drop over
the office tomorrow

46:20.995 --> 46:22.692
and meet the director?

46:22.736 --> 46:24.259
What have I got to lose?

46:24.303 --> 46:26.827
You don't know the director.

46:26.871 --> 46:29.699
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

46:29.743 --> 46:32.137
- It's not much of a part--
- She'll take it.

46:32.180 --> 46:34.574
[chuckles]
Hi. Paul Snider here.

46:34.617 --> 46:37.795
[male #8]
Ms. Stratten, I saw your movie
debut in "Ball Bearings."

46:37.838 --> 46:41.059
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh" is right. Uh..

46:41.102 --> 46:44.758
Now, I'm not the film critic,
but that wasn't much of a part.

46:44.802 --> 46:46.891
Well, I wasn't
much of an actress, either.

46:46.934 --> 46:48.893
Oh? Are you better now?

46:48.936 --> 46:51.156
Oh, God, I hope so.
I'm studying.

46:51.199 --> 46:53.114
- The classics?
- No, acting.

46:53.158 --> 46:55.160
I don't know anything
about music.

46:55.203 --> 46:56.552
He means Shakespeare..

46:56.596 --> 46:58.903
[laughing]

46:58.946 --> 47:00.774
I'm sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

47:03.690 --> 47:06.084
Hefner didn't like it
when I quoted him.

47:06.127 --> 47:08.826
I should've kept my mouth shut.

47:08.869 --> 47:11.393
- Damn.
- I think it just surprised him.

47:13.091 --> 47:15.484
Dumb move.

47:15.528 --> 47:17.225
Maybe you were a little nervous.

47:18.574 --> 47:22.274
Oh, look at
these stupid clothes.

47:25.799 --> 47:27.845
Dumb move quoting him.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.462
You know, I was a little nervous

47:36.505 --> 47:37.898
the first night
I was there, too--

47:37.942 --> 47:40.509
Jesus! Will you
stop sayin' that?

47:46.733 --> 47:48.474
I mean, why the hell
should I be nervous

47:48.517 --> 47:50.868
around Hefner and that crowd?

47:50.911 --> 47:52.608
'A bunch of smart asses'

47:52.652 --> 47:55.785
with their stupid,
faggy hairstyles.

47:55.829 --> 47:57.700
Smug bastards.

47:57.744 --> 47:59.180
And that Vince Roberts.

47:59.224 --> 48:01.617
Boy, does he want
to get into your pants.

48:01.661 --> 48:03.184
Well, he's not going to.

48:04.577 --> 48:07.449
- He's asked you out, hasn't he?
- Yes.

48:07.493 --> 48:08.842
What'd you say?

48:11.192 --> 48:13.194
I said I had a fella.

48:13.238 --> 48:14.892
A steady fella.

48:16.676 --> 48:17.851
You did?

48:23.901 --> 48:25.206
Maybe you should.

48:26.816 --> 48:29.297
- I should what?
- Go out with him.

48:29.341 --> 48:30.690
He said he was reading
some projects.

48:30.733 --> 48:33.867
Oh, I'm really tired.
Let's go to bed.

48:35.390 --> 48:38.393
- Do you think Hefner liked me?
- Paul, come on--

48:38.437 --> 48:41.048
I don't think he liked me.
If he just got to know me..

48:41.092 --> 48:44.008
[instrumental music]

49:09.033 --> 49:11.949
[music continues]

49:26.659 --> 49:28.966
Look, Mr. Hefner,
are you trying to tell me

49:29.009 --> 49:31.272
that you don't want me
to marry Paul?

49:31.316 --> 49:33.013
You have to understand, Dorothy,
that a third party

49:33.057 --> 49:35.059
is in kind of
a funny position, et cetera

49:35.102 --> 49:37.235
when you're trying to counsel
somebody about a marriage.

49:37.278 --> 49:39.977
You never know
how it's going to end up.

49:40.020 --> 49:42.414
It's not because I'm gonna be
a Playmate, is it?

49:43.937 --> 49:45.983
- No, no.
- Of course not.

49:46.026 --> 49:47.549
Well, some of
the other girls told me

49:47.593 --> 49:50.074
that you didn't like
the Playmates to be married.

49:50.117 --> 49:52.380
Frankly, we think it's better
for the image if they're not.

49:52.424 --> 49:53.686
[female #3]
'You understand that,
don't you?'

49:53.729 --> 49:55.253
But several have been.

49:55.296 --> 49:57.646
- Just a moment, Sam.
- Who? Give me some names.

49:57.690 --> 49:59.866
- Cindy was.
- Ginger, I think.

49:59.909 --> 50:01.955
That's right. Cindy, Ginger..

50:01.999 --> 50:03.913
Look, he can't just
come right out and say it.

50:03.957 --> 50:05.611
He's trying
to tell you something.

50:05.654 --> 50:07.178
[Dorothy]
'I know he is
and I think I know'

50:07.221 --> 50:08.875
'what he's trying to tell me.'

50:08.918 --> 50:11.312
But I don't think
he understands.

50:12.444 --> 50:14.098
What's wrong with him?

50:15.229 --> 50:16.491
Well, he's..

50:16.535 --> 50:18.537
He's got the personality
of a pimp.

50:20.626 --> 50:23.585
That was improper.
I shouldn't have said that.

50:23.629 --> 50:26.153
Oh-oh-oh, Mr. Hefner.

50:26.197 --> 50:28.460
That's just the way
he used to dress.

50:28.503 --> 50:30.897
He doesn't dress
like that anymore.

50:32.159 --> 50:33.378
[door opens]

50:36.250 --> 50:38.687
[sighs]
Oh, God.

50:38.731 --> 50:40.907
I am so confused.

50:42.213 --> 50:45.303
I don't think
anybody understands.

50:45.346 --> 50:47.174
I owe it to him.

50:47.218 --> 50:49.611
Ms. Stratten, may I ask you
a personal question?

50:49.655 --> 50:51.831
36-24-36.

50:51.874 --> 50:54.051
No, no, I have that information
in the press release right here.

50:54.094 --> 50:56.531
As a matter of fact,
I have it several times.

50:56.575 --> 50:58.055
I just wanted to know
if you're married.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.928
Yes. I've been married
about three months.

51:01.971 --> 51:03.060
I wonder why you
looked at Ms. Davis

51:03.103 --> 51:04.452
when I asked you that.

51:04.496 --> 51:05.975
- No reason.
- No reason?

51:06.019 --> 51:07.934
- Is he traveling with you?
- No, he's not.

51:07.977 --> 51:09.240
And why is that?

51:09.283 --> 51:11.024
I'd like Ms. Stratten
to answer me.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.026
- If she would.
- He's in LA.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.289
- Working.
- What sort of work does he do?

51:15.333 --> 51:17.770
- He's doing a show.
- 'Sorry, I didn't hear that.'

56:12.281 --> 56:14.936
She is so beautiful.

56:14.980 --> 56:17.896
And you can just tell
she's Mr. Hefner's favorite.

56:17.939 --> 56:19.419
She's the best.

56:19.463 --> 56:22.030
The best.

56:22.074 --> 56:23.771
You're pretty good-looking
yourself, Bobo.

56:23.815 --> 56:26.034
Oh, I'm alright.

okay for him to come over.

I got an idea
for a poster with Dorothy.

57:03.420 --> 57:04.508
Damn!

57:05.291 --> 57:06.423
Oh..

57:08.990 --> 57:10.644
Want to get something to eat?

57:10.688 --> 57:13.255
I'm always hungry..

57:13.299 --> 57:15.301
Does it look like
I'm gaining weight?

57:17.477 --> 57:21.220
Well, I, uh,
first met Mr. Snider

57:21.263 --> 57:23.265
at the Playboy Mansion.

57:23.309 --> 57:25.180
Snider, Paul. Hi.

57:25.224 --> 57:26.530
- Martin Gebber.
- How do you do?

57:26.573 --> 57:28.140
We were, uh, just gonna
feed our faces.

57:28.183 --> 57:31.317
- Join us?
- Sure.

57:31.360 --> 57:33.885
- You practice here, Dr. Gebber?
- Uh, Geb, please.

57:33.928 --> 57:36.496
No, Newport Beach,
but I plan to move here.

57:36.540 --> 57:38.933
Uh-huh. Internist?

57:38.977 --> 57:41.458
Plastic surgery.
Cosmetic, mostly.

57:41.501 --> 57:44.025
You know, Paul is married
to Dorothy Stratten.

57:44.069 --> 57:46.854
He also manages her.
The chicken.

57:46.898 --> 57:48.421
[Gebber]
He told me, he and Dorothy

57:48.465 --> 57:50.205
were looking
for a new place to live.

57:50.249 --> 57:55.080
And maybe since I was
moving my practice to LA

57:55.123 --> 57:58.692
we could find a place
together, share expenses.

57:58.736 --> 58:02.653
We moved in in October
and I took the top half.

58:02.696 --> 58:05.090
They lived on the first floor.
It was right near the freeway.

58:05.133 --> 58:07.875
Noisy as hell,
but it suited me fine.

58:07.919 --> 58:09.573
It had a yard for King

58:09.616 --> 58:12.184
a garage for my Rolls-Royce.

58:12.227 --> 58:16.580
Um, the Rolls, the Rolls
is an investment for me.

58:16.623 --> 58:19.060
It's an investment,
I'm not into status symbols

58:19.104 --> 58:21.323
like most people out here.

58:21.367 --> 58:23.282
It's an investment, okay?

58:23.325 --> 58:26.372
Dorothy had already done
the centerfold.

58:26.415 --> 58:27.547
Miss August.

58:27.591 --> 58:29.767
She had already done parts

58:29.810 --> 58:31.986
in "Fantasy Island"

58:32.030 --> 58:34.467
and, uh, "Buck Rogers."

58:34.511 --> 58:36.338
Things were moving fast for her.

58:36.382 --> 58:38.689
I became very fond of her.

58:38.732 --> 58:41.213
She was handling her
public visibility very well.

58:41.256 --> 58:43.084
She was maturing
very fast for 19.

58:43.128 --> 58:44.651
But to me,
she was just a friend.

58:44.695 --> 58:47.175
Understand? Just a friend.

58:47.219 --> 58:50.527
I had a gal, Robin.

58:50.570 --> 58:52.964
I stayed with her
most of the time.

58:53.007 --> 58:56.707
So I didn't spend much time
at the house.

58:56.750 --> 58:59.274
But we'd get together
once in a while.

58:59.318 --> 59:02.495
Sunday-afternoon barbecue
with a few friends.

59:02.539 --> 59:04.671
Did you make this contraption
yourself?

59:04.715 --> 59:06.847
- Twelve of 'em.
- Who are you selling 'em to?

59:06.891 --> 59:09.110
To anybody who wants to buy one.

59:11.286 --> 59:13.593
She's got no real
competition, you know?

59:13.637 --> 59:16.683
Oh, well, what about
Miss December? Vicki something?

59:16.727 --> 59:18.337
Next to Dorothy? You're kidding.

59:18.380 --> 59:19.773
Where do you want me to put it?

59:19.817 --> 59:22.210
In the garage,
with all the other no sales.

59:22.254 --> 59:23.516
You should buy
one of those, Nick.

59:25.213 --> 59:26.606

I mean, nobody else
is in the same class.

59:31.045 --> 59:34.266
'Then you can all visit us
in Bel-Air.'

59:34.309 --> 59:35.876
- Right.
- Do you hear that?

59:35.920 --> 59:38.749
- What?
- You're moving to Bel-Air.

59:38.792 --> 59:40.620
Oh, yeah, sure. When?

59:40.664 --> 59:42.622
When you become
Playmate of the Year.

59:42.666 --> 59:44.842
- Get out of here.
- 'No, I'm with him.'

'I think you're gonna be
Playmate of the Year, too.'

59:49.150 --> 59:50.848

59:50.891 --> 59:52.676
- 'What is it?'
- I know what that is.

59:52.719 --> 59:54.721
I saw that in a shop
on Santa Monica.

that's for exercise, Paul.

- I think I know what it's for.
- 'So do I.'

What is it?
Somebody tell me. What?

01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:08.169
- Well..
- Tell her.

- Who's the girl in the red cap?
- Ah. That's Dorothy Stratten.

Why don't you put her
in your picture, Aram?

01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:28.048
- No.
- Huh?

- Only deal with Peter. Okay?
- Why? What's up?

01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:41.105
I'll tell you another time.
Nice to see you, Aram.

Yeah.

- "The Last Chase?"

No. If it comes up,
should I lie?

01:07:37.618 --> 01:07:38.619
No.

01:07:40.665 --> 01:07:41.796
Uh-uh.

01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:46.714
But...I have this terrific idea.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.848
I'm your manager, right?

01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:52.764
Well, as your manager, I think
you should go to New York

01:07:52.807 --> 01:07:55.201
and become a big movie star.

01:07:55.245 --> 01:07:57.682
I'll stay here and work
on the Dorothy Stratten poster.

01:07:57.725 --> 01:08:00.859
It's gonna
make us a fortune, huh?

01:08:00.902 --> 01:08:02.034
Good idea?

01:08:03.383 --> 01:08:05.559
It came to me just like that.

01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:07.039
[sniffles]

01:08:08.954 --> 01:08:10.086
Hey.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:14.655
You're my queen.

01:08:18.877 --> 01:08:22.140
I don't know, he seemed
in exceptionally good spirits

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:23.969
just before she left.

01:08:24.011 --> 01:08:26.319
Helping her with this and that.

01:08:26.363 --> 01:08:28.365
Being really attentive.

01:08:28.408 --> 01:08:29.975
[Gebber]
Gave her a going-away party.

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:31.977
It must have cost a fortune.

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:35.067
Borrowed my Rolls
to drive her to the airport.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:38.157
Said, "The queen
has to go in style."

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:41.943
And after she left,
he came back here to the house.

01:08:41.987 --> 01:08:42.988
And then..

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:46.774
Then he did the damnedest thing.

01:08:46.818 --> 01:08:50.343
I'm still not sure
why he did it..

01:08:50.386 --> 01:08:54.086
...but he built
a doghouse for King.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:57.828
A beautiful doghouse.
Craziest thing.

01:08:57.872 --> 01:08:59.831
I didn't think
he even knew I had a dog.

01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:04.183
- Yeah, okay, Caroline.
- Okay.

01:09:04.227 --> 01:09:05.966
Yeah, come. Give me more.

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:07.926
Come in. Yeah, a little further.

01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:10.363
Yeah, hold that, hold that.
Yeah, mark it. Mark it.

01:09:10.407 --> 01:09:12.886
- Take a look, Gary.
- Yeah.

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:14.453
[indistinct chatter]

01:09:14.497 --> 01:09:16.412
- Is that okay?
- That's nice.

01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:22.897
[saw whirring]

01:09:26.336 --> 01:09:28.468
You shouldn't chew gum.
It's got sugar in it.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.042
[giggles]

01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:38.609
Thank you.

01:09:38.652 --> 01:09:40.741
[Paul]
It's him. I know it.

01:09:40.785 --> 01:09:43.439
I can tell from the way
she says his name on the phone.

01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:46.225
- And what does she say?
- Oh. Not too much.

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:49.054
She always says, uh, she's been
working on Aram's film all day

01:09:49.096 --> 01:09:50.663
and doesn't feel like talking.

01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:53.363
- Why can't you accept that?
- She calls it film.

01:09:53.406 --> 01:09:55.756
Christ, she never said
film before.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.194
She always said movie
or picture, but never film.

01:10:01.066 --> 01:10:02.894
I bet he calls it film.

01:10:02.937 --> 01:10:04.374
Well, that's hardly
a sufficient cause

01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:06.898
to put yourself
through all this.

01:10:06.941 --> 01:10:09.553
- 'Yeah.'
- He's feeding her coke.

01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:11.424
Paul..

01:10:11.468 --> 01:10:13.644
I know you're upset,
but you shouldn't even say that.

01:10:13.687 --> 01:10:16.864
'And knowing Dorothy,
I doubt it. Uh, you're wrong.'

01:10:16.908 --> 01:10:19.040
Yeah? She kept
sniffing last night.

01:10:19.084 --> 01:10:21.652
[sniffing]
Through the whole conversation

01:10:21.695 --> 01:10:23.480
she kept sniffing.

01:10:23.523 --> 01:10:26.439
- Well, maybe she's got a cold.
- 'Yeah. That's what she said.'

01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:28.267
Cold, my ass.

01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:29.964
Paul, you're gonna
make yourself looney

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:31.966
if you keep goin' like this.

01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:35.840
You gotta realize Dorothy is
every man's fantasy.

01:10:35.883 --> 01:10:37.929
Everybody who sees her
or even her picture

01:10:37.972 --> 01:10:39.800
in a magazine, for that matter

01:10:39.844 --> 01:10:41.976
'is gonna be comin' after her.'

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.848
And there's always
gonna be someone

01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:45.937
who is richer than you

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.461
more famous than you..

01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:50.942
...has a longer penis than you.

01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:52.291
There's nothing
you can do about it.

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.250
She's not herself, man.

01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:55.947
Look, I know these guys, Geb.

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.340
They stick a little coke
up a girl's nose

01:10:57.383 --> 01:10:58.689
they figure she'll do anything.

01:10:58.732 --> 01:11:01.257
Jesus, you haven't heard
one word I've said.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:05.870
Look, all you can do
is let her know you love her.

01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:09.308
Get your own feet on the ground.
Stop complaining!

01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:11.789
Go out and get yourself a job,
get something goin'

01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:13.747
and try to make her
proud of you.

01:11:16.228 --> 01:11:19.187
I know it. You're right.

01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:25.629
I can handle this.
I can handle this.

01:11:25.672 --> 01:11:27.935
What line of business
are you in?

01:11:27.979 --> 01:11:30.416
Well, I was thinkin'
in terms of a health spa.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.288
You know who, uh,
Dorothy Stratten is, don't you?

01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:33.985
- Oh, I think so.
- Well, that's my wife.

01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:35.465
And I'm her personal manager.

01:11:35.508 --> 01:11:36.727
[Paul]
I was thinkin' of calling it

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:38.598
Dorothy Stratten's Health Spa.

01:11:38.642 --> 01:11:41.471
All of modern equipment.
Nautilus, steam, sauna.

01:11:41.514 --> 01:11:43.255
You know, they're into
that sorta thing out here.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.431
You just give 'em white teeth,
a sun tan and some muscles

01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:47.346
and, bang, you're a hit.

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:49.609
I saw a hot location
on Santa Monica.

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:53.178
The real-estate woman said
the owner wants 2500 a month.

01:11:53.221 --> 01:11:56.486
But she's pretty sure
it will come down.

01:11:56.529 --> 01:11:57.791
What do you think?

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:03.667
Is something wrong, Dorothy?

01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:06.757
No.

01:12:08.498 --> 01:12:10.151
Well, what do you think?

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:14.547
- Sounds okay.
- You don't like it.

01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:15.896
I can tell by
the tone of your voice

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.246
you don't like it. Shit!

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:20.988
Paul, do you think
we could talk tomorrow? Uh..

01:12:21.032 --> 01:12:22.947
I'm really tired, I guess.

01:12:26.167 --> 01:12:28.431
Yeah, sure. Um..

01:12:28.474 --> 01:12:30.911
Listen..

01:12:30.955 --> 01:12:32.739
I called a couple of times
last night.

01:12:32.783 --> 01:12:35.351
Did, uh, did you get
any of my messages?

01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:38.963
Yes, I did,
but we worked very late.

01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:40.573
How late?

01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:43.359
I don't remember exactly.
I was with Peggy.

01:12:43.402 --> 01:12:45.578
- 'Peggy Johnson.'
- Who's Peggy Johnson?

01:12:45.622 --> 01:12:48.538
Oh. Well, she's an actress.
She's in the film, too.

01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:50.496
'You'd like her,
she's really nice.'

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.717
Anyway, we've become friends
and...it got so late

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.936
that I spent the night
at her apartment.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.504
I didn't wanna wake you.
I thought you'd be sleeping.

01:13:00.158 --> 01:13:01.899
I'm staying at Nancy's house.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.077
I guess you didn't
wanna wake me.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.905
Paul, I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:10.255
Nothing, it was nothing.

01:13:10.298 --> 01:13:13.040
So, uh, how are things goin'
on the set?

01:13:13.084 --> 01:13:14.868
[Dorothy]
'Paul, don't start with me.'

01:13:14.912 --> 01:13:17.436
Uh, are you, uh,
getting along alright?

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.133
- With the director?
- 'Don't do that.'

01:13:19.177 --> 01:13:20.874
'Cause, uh,
I think it's important

01:13:20.918 --> 01:13:23.181
that an actress and her director

01:13:23.224 --> 01:13:25.444
should have a good relationship.

01:13:29.187 --> 01:13:31.407
[Paul]
There must be something
you can do, for Christ's sake.

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:32.756
He's stealing my wife.

01:13:34.279 --> 01:13:35.454
Can't we sue him?

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:36.586
Can't we make the bastard pay?

01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:37.630
Pay for something?

01:13:37.674 --> 01:13:39.893
Sue? For what?

01:13:39.937 --> 01:13:42.548
For what? You're the detective.

01:13:42.592 --> 01:13:44.768
You're supposed to be able
to tell me for what.

01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:48.902
Are you her manager?

01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:51.035
- Yes.
- You got any contracts?

01:13:51.078 --> 01:13:52.471
Any papers?

01:13:57.607 --> 01:13:59.783
But it was something
you both talked about, right?

01:13:59.826 --> 01:14:03.003
- It was understood, right?
- Yes, it was understood.

01:14:03.047 --> 01:14:05.223
You had a verbal contract,
then, right?

01:14:05.266 --> 01:14:07.486
That's right.
We had a verbal contract.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:10.271
We're a team.
I discovered her.

01:14:10.315 --> 01:14:12.839
Yeah, I know. You said that.

01:14:12.883 --> 01:14:15.842
Well, maybe..

01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:18.018
Maybe we can try suing him

01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:21.152
for enticement to breach her
management contract with you.

01:14:21.195 --> 01:14:23.067
- Yeah, that's it.
- Not so fast.

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:25.852
I'm not a lawyer.
I'd have to check with one.

01:14:25.896 --> 01:14:28.464
I know we'd have to have
documentation.

01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:31.641
I'd like to kill
that son of a bitch.

01:14:31.684 --> 01:14:33.381
I can't help you with that.

01:14:33.425 --> 01:14:35.340
[Dorothy]
He called me five times
last night.

01:14:35.383 --> 01:14:38.256
I didn't get any sleep.

01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:40.563
That's why
I kept missing my mark.

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:42.521
We'll get it after lunch.

01:14:42.565 --> 01:14:45.132
I don't know why I feel
this loyalty to him.

01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:49.485
He's fooling around. I know it.

01:14:49.528 --> 01:14:51.312
He's got other women.
He always has.

01:14:52.749 --> 01:14:54.359
At about three o'clock
in the morning

01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:55.926
every fuckin' creep in the strip

01:14:55.969 --> 01:14:58.232
seems to wind up at our joint.

01:14:58.276 --> 01:15:00.104
[female #5]
He didn't look any different
from any other schmuck

01:15:00.147 --> 01:15:02.323
in this town,
but he talked nicer.

01:15:02.367 --> 01:15:04.587
He-he said he could get me
in "Playboy".

01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:05.936
That he knew Hef.

01:15:05.979 --> 01:15:07.807
He said he could get me
into movies.

01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:12.029
He had a business card
and a Mercedes 450SL.

01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:13.944
So what the fuck?

01:15:13.987 --> 01:15:15.162
[swing music]

01:15:17.556 --> 01:15:19.210
What about the health-club idea?

01:15:19.253 --> 01:15:21.168
Couldn't get any backing for it.

01:15:21.212 --> 01:15:23.170
No one will give him any money.

01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:28.175
What?

01:15:28.219 --> 01:15:30.526
Say it.

01:15:30.569 --> 01:15:33.398
Well...I just don't think
you should lend your name

01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:35.356
to something like that,
a health club

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.097
with him or anyone else.

01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:44.714
The more he fails, the more
he seems to hang on to me.

01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:46.324
[Paul]
Uh, yeah, this is Paul Snider.

01:15:46.367 --> 01:15:47.978
'I've been trying to get
through to Hef. I've left sev..'

01:15:48.021 --> 01:15:49.588
Snider.

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:51.590
Mr. Hefner is out of town.
Can I help you?

01:15:51.634 --> 01:15:53.244
Who is this?
Who am I talking to?

01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:55.507
[Roy on phone]
'I'm Roy,
Mr. Hefner's assistant.'

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:58.554
Oh. Well, listen, Roy,
here's what it is.

01:15:58.597 --> 01:16:00.381
I'd, uh, like to drop by
the mansion tonight.

01:16:00.425 --> 01:16:01.992
- And talk to him.
- But I've already told you.

01:16:02.035 --> 01:16:04.168
- 'Right, he's out of town.'
- Oh, shit--

01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:06.083
[Paul]
'But, uh, just on the chance
that he's back tonight'

01:16:06.126 --> 01:16:08.346
there's someone
I'd like him to see.

01:16:08.389 --> 01:16:10.391
Would you, maybe, leave my name
at the gate, Roy?

01:16:10.435 --> 01:16:11.610
I'm very sorry, I can't do that.

01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:13.481
Only Mr. Hefner himself
can do that.

01:16:13.525 --> 01:16:14.961
[Paul]
'Oh, I'm sure you can, Roy.'

01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:16.876
I know it's done,
it's done all the time.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.617
Come on, give it a try.

01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:20.488
Hey, oh, we've met,
haven't we, Roy?

01:16:20.532 --> 01:16:22.578
I was probably with Dorothy,
Dorothy Stratten.

01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:24.449
I know who you are,
but I can't help you.

01:16:24.492 --> 01:16:25.842
I will leave
your message, though.

01:16:25.885 --> 01:16:27.626
Okay, sport, leave the message.

01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:29.672
- 'I'll call back. I'll--'
- Who the fuck is this?

01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:31.674
I bet you don't
even know Hefner.

01:16:31.717 --> 01:16:34.546
What time? What time would be
a good time to call back?

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.374
- I really couldn't tell you.
- No.

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:39.812
Well, I didn't think you could.

01:16:39.856 --> 01:16:41.814
Thanks for all your help, Roy.

01:16:41.858 --> 01:16:43.468
- 'You're welcome.'
- Oh..

01:16:45.557 --> 01:16:47.037
Are we or aren't we going?

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.953
That son of a bitch was there
the whole time.

01:16:49.996 --> 01:16:51.128
Uh..

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:54.218
[sighs]

01:16:56.002 --> 01:16:57.613
Do you wanna stay with him?

01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:02.052
Do you wanna leave him?

01:17:04.402 --> 01:17:05.925
'What do you want to do?'

01:17:08.885 --> 01:17:11.191
I think you're gonna need
some legal help.

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:13.150
You should probably
talk to a lawyer.

01:17:17.676 --> 01:17:19.852
[sobbing]

01:17:19.896 --> 01:17:22.550
Dorothy, you just can't
let him do this to you.

01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:24.509
He's got to give you
more freedom.

01:17:27.077 --> 01:17:29.993
[sobbing]

01:17:33.605 --> 01:17:35.563
[Aram]
'You gotta understand.'

01:17:35.607 --> 01:17:39.350
'You're just not the same girl
you were in Vancouver.'

01:17:39.393 --> 01:17:42.309
'You've grown. You've matured.'

01:17:44.007 --> 01:17:46.531
I see it happening
right before my eyes..

01:17:46.574 --> 01:17:49.229
...every day.

01:17:49.273 --> 01:17:50.709
You're unique, Dorothy.

01:17:52.102 --> 01:17:54.017
And you have a unique gift.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:58.761
You've grown.
And he stayed the same.

01:18:00.545 --> 01:18:01.589
[Dorothy]
Hollywood hasn't changed

01:18:01.633 --> 01:18:04.157
my values or my personality.

01:18:04.201 --> 01:18:06.943
But it certainly made me wiser.

01:18:06.986 --> 01:18:10.511
I think I've gained five years' experience in eighteen months.

01:18:13.123 --> 01:18:14.690
You've outgrown him.

01:18:16.213 --> 01:18:17.605
This is a little rough.

01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:20.260
Are you sure
you wanna to hear it?

01:18:20.304 --> 01:18:22.219
Okay.

01:18:22.262 --> 01:18:24.482
"She's practically
moved out of The Wyndham.

01:18:24.525 --> 01:18:26.310
"She usually goes there
after shooting

01:18:26.353 --> 01:18:30.357
"picks up messages
and walks over to The Plaza.

01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:32.316
'"He's in suite 1210.'

01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:36.799
'"They usually eat in the hotel'

01:18:36.842 --> 01:18:39.018
'"and in the morning,
she goes back to The Wyndham'

01:18:39.062 --> 01:18:42.456
'where she waits for the studio
car to come pick her up."'

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:46.286
'So you were right
all along. It is him.'

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:48.245
'They're hiding it pretty good.'

01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.856
'You alright?'

01:18:51.988 --> 01:18:53.250
Yeah, sure.

01:18:54.338 --> 01:18:57.167
I just gotta take a piss.

01:18:57.210 --> 01:19:00.997
'Uh, if we just had something,
a letter, a tape.'

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.695
Anything where she talks about
the management thing

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.132
I think we might have something.

01:19:06.176 --> 01:19:09.179
- Or enticement, I mean.
- Ah, fuck both of 'em.

01:19:09.222 --> 01:19:12.008
Why don't we just say,
"Look, you want her, pal?

01:19:12.051 --> 01:19:15.402
You can have her.
But you're gonna have to pay."

01:19:15.446 --> 01:19:19.015
I know how you feel,
but I don't think so.

01:19:19.058 --> 01:19:23.019
'Yeah, maybe there's something
in alienation of affection.'

01:19:23.062 --> 01:19:24.237
[retching]

01:19:25.673 --> 01:19:26.762
I don't think so.

01:19:34.944 --> 01:19:36.119
[gunshot]

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:41.211
Yeah, it was 379.95, new.

01:19:41.254 --> 01:19:44.040
And you can have it
for 250, even.

01:19:44.083 --> 01:19:45.911
It's only a year old.

01:19:45.955 --> 01:19:48.522
[chuckles]
It was only fired on Sundays

01:19:48.566 --> 01:19:50.873
by a little, old, psychotic
school teacher.

01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:52.744
- How do you load it?
- 'Oh, easy.'

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.790
Takes one to five.

01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:56.661
I'll give you one.

01:19:56.704 --> 01:19:58.576
And put it in the chamber.

01:19:58.619 --> 01:20:01.318
'You press the button
and you cock it..'

01:20:03.407 --> 01:20:05.409
And she's ready to go.

01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:08.368
[instrumental music]

01:20:13.896 --> 01:20:15.158
You're lefty, huh?

01:20:19.336 --> 01:20:20.685
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:20:23.906 --> 01:20:25.255
[gunshot]

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.086
Well, we got a sale?

01:20:43.186 --> 01:20:46.015
[music continues]

01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:48.539
[Gebber]
He was acting really weird.

01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:52.325
He pasted, pinned, Scotch-Taped

01:20:52.369 --> 01:20:55.415
glued photos of her, of him

01:20:55.459 --> 01:20:57.896
of him and her, of her and him

01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.289
all over the downstairs

01:20:59.332 --> 01:21:02.074
like some sort
of bizarre shrine.

01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:03.336
Weird.

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.208
Frankly..

01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:07.819
I thought it was a little
like a soap opera.

01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:11.605
And I obviously misread him.

01:21:11.649 --> 01:21:13.129
[Paul]
'That's pretty much
the same picture'

01:21:13.172 --> 01:21:14.913
'which was taken
down the block.'

01:21:14.957 --> 01:21:17.220
'Aw, look.'

01:21:17.263 --> 01:21:19.091
That's Eileen.

01:21:19.135 --> 01:21:20.788
What a kid.

01:21:20.832 --> 01:21:22.790
I was thinking of bringing her
down here for a visit

01:21:22.834 --> 01:21:24.531
when Dorothy comes back.

01:21:24.575 --> 01:21:26.055
That'd be fun.

01:21:26.098 --> 01:21:29.449
[Paul]
It's rough. It's really rough.

01:21:29.493 --> 01:21:31.408
I'm not sure I can take it.

01:21:31.451 --> 01:21:33.889
Listen, Robin,
I wanna get these to King.

01:21:33.932 --> 01:21:37.153
[Paul]
Did you see the prom picture?

01:21:37.196 --> 01:21:40.808
Did I show that to you?
I bought her this white dress.

01:21:40.852 --> 01:21:42.027
Here it is.

01:21:48.077 --> 01:21:50.253
I've never felt this way before.

01:21:50.296 --> 01:21:52.037
She broke my heart.

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:55.171
Nice, huh?

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.739
I've got a better one.

01:21:58.783 --> 01:22:01.090
Paul, look,
we really gotta move along.

01:22:01.133 --> 01:22:03.266
It's where I'm holding her
and we were dancing.

01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:05.094
It's really nice.
Wait, just a second.

01:22:05.137 --> 01:22:08.010
We'll be back in an hour,
alright?

01:22:08.053 --> 01:22:10.012
- Okay, man.
- Okay, we'll catch you later.

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:12.057
- Okay.
- Take it easy, okay?

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:20.283
Whoa! Man.

01:22:20.326 --> 01:22:21.937
I thought I'd crack up
when he said

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.156
"She's broken my heart."

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.419
I didn't think it was funny.

01:22:26.463 --> 01:22:29.857
I can take a bragging Snider,
I can take a conniving Snider.

01:22:29.901 --> 01:22:32.077
[whistles]
King.

01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:33.644
Yeah.

01:22:33.687 --> 01:22:37.691
I just can't stomach
a sentimental Snider.

01:22:37.735 --> 01:22:39.693
It's about the only time
I've liked him.

01:22:39.737 --> 01:22:42.696
- Get outta here. Why?
- I don't know, really.

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:46.352
- This macho guy, like that.
- Oh..

01:22:46.396 --> 01:22:48.572
You don't suppose
he'd do anything crazy, do you?

01:22:48.615 --> 01:22:50.356
- Like what?
- I don't know.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.662
Like, hurt himself?

01:22:51.705 --> 01:22:53.620
Not if it means
mussing his hair.

01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:58.930
Can't we talk now?
I'm goin' a little crazy.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:02.238
[Dorothy on phone]
'I'll see you
when I come to Los Angeles.'

01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:04.414
You closed
the joint bank account.

01:23:04.457 --> 01:23:06.068
- 'Yes.'
- Why?

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:07.634
'I'll send you some money.'

01:23:07.678 --> 01:23:10.420
You didn't answer why.

01:23:10.463 --> 01:23:12.596
- 'I thought it best.'
- For what?

01:23:12.639 --> 01:23:14.990
'Our situation, Paul.
I have to hang up now.'

01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:17.166
No, please don't hang up.

01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:19.168
Just what the hell
is our situation?

01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:22.606
Jesus, tell me something,
will ya?

01:23:22.649 --> 01:23:25.783
Look, if you've had an affair,
that's okay with me.

01:23:25.826 --> 01:23:28.220
I understand,
but that doesn't mean

01:23:28.264 --> 01:23:29.830
that we should throw
the whole marriage

01:23:29.874 --> 01:23:31.441
down the toilet.

01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:33.095
Please, Dorothy.

01:23:33.138 --> 01:23:35.053
At least tell me where I stand.

01:23:37.795 --> 01:23:40.537
I have to have more freedom.

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:42.800
I want more freedom.

01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:45.324
Dorothy, you can have
more freedom, honest.

01:23:45.368 --> 01:23:47.065
That's not enough.

01:23:50.895 --> 01:23:52.462
Things change.

01:23:54.507 --> 01:23:57.293
I'm not the same girl
I was in Vancouver.

01:23:57.336 --> 01:23:59.686
No, you sure ain't.

01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:01.601
Sounds like
you've got a writer now.

01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:03.516
I don't understand
what you're saying.

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.823
I mean, I have a hunch

01:24:05.866 --> 01:24:08.347
that you're sitting
on Aram's knee right now

01:24:08.391 --> 01:24:11.220
and he's moving your mouth.
He's pulling the strings!

01:24:11.263 --> 01:24:12.830
[Dorothy]
'We'll talk when I come in.'

01:24:12.873 --> 01:24:14.484
[indistinct chatter]

01:24:14.527 --> 01:24:17.008
[Paul]
'You're living with him.'

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:20.533
I'm staying at his house
temporarily.

01:24:20.577 --> 01:24:23.319
You're living with him,
you're sleeping with him.

01:24:23.362 --> 01:24:25.538
You're fucking him.

01:24:25.582 --> 01:24:27.845
Why don't you have the guts
to say it? You're doing it.

01:24:27.888 --> 01:24:30.500
Why can't you say it?

01:24:30.543 --> 01:24:32.719
Take off the goddamn glasses.

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.946
I'm broke.

01:24:46.951 --> 01:24:50.346
Paul, I'll take care of you.
You know that.

01:24:50.389 --> 01:24:52.304
Eileen is here, isn't she?

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.440
Listen, too much
has happened already.

01:24:59.181 --> 01:25:02.140
I'll call you in a few days.

01:25:02.184 --> 01:25:04.055
Maybe we can talk then.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:06.101
About a divorce?
Is that what you mean?

01:25:08.364 --> 01:25:09.321
Yes.

01:25:10.844 --> 01:25:12.411
I could change.

01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:14.021
Jesus, give me a chance,
will you?

01:25:14.065 --> 01:25:15.197
[Dorothy]
I'll call.

01:25:16.546 --> 01:25:18.591
[instrumental music]

01:25:18.635 --> 01:25:21.159
[Aram]
Goddamn it! He must be
having you followed.

01:25:21.203 --> 01:25:22.856
Son of a bitch.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.336
I don't want you
to see him anymore.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.295
The whole thing can be
handled in other ways.

01:25:29.036 --> 01:25:30.951
Promise me
you won't see him anymore.

01:25:31.909 --> 01:25:33.693
He seemed so scared.

01:25:33.737 --> 01:25:36.174
Hey, sis, come on in! Please?

01:25:36.218 --> 01:25:39.046
Dorothy, I want you to promise.

01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:42.615
Okay, I promise.

01:25:42.659 --> 01:25:44.226
[indistinct chatter]

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.665
- How's the water?
- It's warm.

01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:49.666
[Dorothy]
'Yeah?'

01:25:51.494 --> 01:25:53.583
'You'll probably
have to lead her a little.'

01:25:53.626 --> 01:25:55.628
Try and get her
to talk about Aram.

01:25:55.672 --> 01:25:57.195
Juicy stuff if you can.

01:25:57.239 --> 01:25:58.631
Even better if you can
get her to talk about

01:25:58.675 --> 01:26:00.590
the management thing.

01:26:00.633 --> 01:26:02.635
She's gonna come back.
I know it.

01:26:02.679 --> 01:26:05.595
Yeah, sure.
Well, just in case..

01:26:08.989 --> 01:26:11.035
[female #5]
He kept changing
his fucking mind.

01:26:11.078 --> 01:26:12.993
First he said I could have
some of her clothes.

01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:15.605
And then he said no,
she was coming back to him.

01:26:15.648 --> 01:26:17.128
It didn't mean a shit to me.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.173
[Aram]
'Marker.'

01:26:19.391 --> 01:26:23.482
- 'Dorothy?'
- Sam, I'm here.

01:26:23.526 --> 01:26:25.136
[Dorothy on phone]
'Well, I just have
a few errands to run'

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.964
'and then
I'll be back about 2:30.'

01:26:27.007 --> 01:26:28.705
'I promised Eileen
that we'd buy out'

01:26:28.748 --> 01:26:30.576
'Rodeo Drive this afternoon.'

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:33.057
Oh, wow! It's you!

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:34.885
You're in the TV guide.

01:26:34.928 --> 01:26:36.626
I-I'm sorry, Aram.

01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:39.150
Eileen's going a little
bananas over something.

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:40.673
'I didn't hear what you said.'

01:26:40.717 --> 01:26:42.109
Yeah, I said, I said
I won't be home till late.

01:26:42.153 --> 01:26:43.459
I've gotta stop at the lab.

01:26:43.502 --> 01:26:45.243
- Look, it's you.
- Shh..

01:26:45.287 --> 01:26:47.071
Just a second. Um..

01:26:47.114 --> 01:26:48.420
Take it back a little.

01:26:51.597 --> 01:26:52.729
There. Try it there.

01:26:54.557 --> 01:26:56.950
[Paul]
She said, "I'll always
take care of you."

01:26:56.994 --> 01:26:59.126
Yeah, now, if you can
just get her to repeat that..

01:27:00.171 --> 01:27:02.260
Okay, push the button down

01:27:02.304 --> 01:27:04.784
walk around and talk.

01:27:04.828 --> 01:27:06.482
It's gonna be a different shirt.

01:27:06.525 --> 01:27:07.874
[laughs]
So?

01:27:10.094 --> 01:27:11.182
Well, what do you
want me to say?

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:12.966
Anything. Anything. Come on.

01:27:15.012 --> 01:27:17.057
Hi, I'm Paul Snider.

01:27:17.101 --> 01:27:18.407
Paul Snider. Hi.

01:27:21.671 --> 01:27:23.020
More, more.

01:27:25.065 --> 01:27:27.416
Testing. One, two, three, four.

01:27:27.459 --> 01:27:30.245
Testing. One, two, three, four.

01:27:31.158 --> 01:27:33.248
[laughing]

01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:34.249
Okay.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:40.472
You know, we just need
to straighten some things out.

01:27:40.516 --> 01:27:43.083
You know, once we see
each other, it'll be okay.

01:27:43.127 --> 01:27:44.259
[recorder crackling]

01:27:46.957 --> 01:27:49.960
Damn. Damn thing doesn't work.

01:27:50.003 --> 01:27:51.440
Hell, we don't need it anyway.

01:27:51.483 --> 01:27:53.093
I mean, once we spend
some time together

01:27:53.137 --> 01:27:55.444
everything's gonna be
fine again. I know it.

01:27:55.487 --> 01:27:56.967
He called me in the morning
and said

01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:58.664
he was going to see her
that day.

01:28:02.102 --> 01:28:04.496
It says Thursday at 8 p.m.

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:07.760
- Can we watch it together?
- Absolutely. We've got a date.

01:28:09.719 --> 01:28:11.460
I'll see you at 2:30, okay?

01:28:11.503 --> 01:28:14.201
He still had some crazy idea

01:28:14.245 --> 01:28:17.640
that he could put it all
back together again.

01:28:17.683 --> 01:28:19.729
He vacuumed the rug,
he polished the vinyl.

01:28:19.772 --> 01:28:21.296
He cleaned the whole house.

01:28:31.218 --> 01:28:33.699
She arrived
a little after noon.

01:28:33.743 --> 01:28:36.528
The plan was, uh,
I was to call in an hour or so

01:28:36.572 --> 01:28:38.922
to see how it was going.

01:28:38.965 --> 01:28:41.011
Uh, we worked out a little code

01:28:41.054 --> 01:28:44.362
so she wouldn't know
he was talking to me.

01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:47.670
I tried to get through
on the phone, but, uh..

01:28:47.713 --> 01:28:49.715
Well, you know what happened.

01:28:49.759 --> 01:28:52.631
[breathing heavily]

01:28:53.763 --> 01:28:55.112
I've been drinking.

01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:58.811
I'm nervous.

01:29:00.422 --> 01:29:01.771
I am, too.

01:29:04.948 --> 01:29:07.037
Look, look at my hand. Huh.

01:29:10.388 --> 01:29:11.694
This is a new shirt.

01:29:14.914 --> 01:29:17.395
I must have combed my hair
a dozen times.

01:29:17.439 --> 01:29:18.831
[chuckles]

01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:20.485
I guess I had some crazy idea

01:29:20.529 --> 01:29:21.878
I could win you back.

01:29:21.921 --> 01:29:23.880
A real schmuck, huh?

01:29:26.578 --> 01:29:29.320
There's no chance, is there?

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:31.366
We have some things
we should talk about.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.805
I know.

01:29:38.721 --> 01:29:41.419
I love you, Dorothy.
I love you so much.

01:29:43.290 --> 01:29:45.641
I can give you $7000.

01:29:45.684 --> 01:29:47.120
Please come back to me.

01:29:47.164 --> 01:29:49.253
[sighs]

01:29:49.296 --> 01:29:51.560
It's half of everything I have.

01:29:51.603 --> 01:29:54.084
Let's make it
like it was before.

01:29:54.127 --> 01:29:56.042
Please?

01:29:56.086 --> 01:29:58.088
I have some of it here with me.

01:30:01.221 --> 01:30:03.136
Remember the ring I gave you?

01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:06.531
- Yes.
- You still have it?

01:30:08.794 --> 01:30:09.926
Yes.

01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:16.498
I don't think I wanna go on
living without you.

01:30:17.803 --> 01:30:19.283
I bought a gun.

01:30:20.110 --> 01:30:21.851
Oh, Paul.

01:30:24.549 --> 01:30:27.465
- Things will change for you.
- No!

01:30:27.509 --> 01:30:28.901
What, you mean,
maybe I'll grow up

01:30:28.945 --> 01:30:31.556
to be a big movie director?

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:34.516
Or own a big magazine?
Is that what you mean?

01:30:34.559 --> 01:30:37.693
Maybe then I could get you back!
Is that what you're saying?

01:30:37.736 --> 01:30:40.739
Sit down!
Those fucking bastards!

01:30:40.783 --> 01:30:42.262
I wanna leave.

01:30:42.306 --> 01:30:44.613
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:30:44.656 --> 01:30:47.746
Please don't leave me.

01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:50.183
I wanna show you something.
Please stay, just a minute.

01:30:51.663 --> 01:30:53.012
I won't do that again.

01:30:56.712 --> 01:30:57.669
Please.

01:31:05.503 --> 01:31:08.680
I have been working
my ass off on these.

01:31:10.552 --> 01:31:12.031
God, I hope you like them.

01:31:15.034 --> 01:31:16.079
Okay..

01:31:21.127 --> 01:31:22.955
They're a lot better
than the Farrah Fawcett ones'

01:31:22.999 --> 01:31:24.609
'aren't they?'

01:31:24.653 --> 01:31:28.134
I mean, she sold five million
of them in one year.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:31.137
Well, which one do you think?

01:31:36.665 --> 01:31:39.015
We could at least
still be in business together.

01:31:41.844 --> 01:31:44.760
Don't shake your fuckin' head
like that at me!

01:31:44.803 --> 01:31:48.111
Is it too small-time
for the big movie star, huh?

01:31:48.154 --> 01:31:49.721
Too tasteless, maybe?

01:31:49.765 --> 01:31:52.681
- I think--
- Oh-ho-ho! You think.

01:31:54.987 --> 01:31:57.555
I think that we should
break cleanly.

01:31:57.599 --> 01:32:00.471
- Oh.
- I want it to be over.

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:04.257
Hm. Is that what
Aram told you to say?

01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:07.957
And what the fuck is $7000?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.089
You think I'm stupid?

01:32:10.133 --> 01:32:14.224
I may not be a Hefner
or an Aram, but I'm not stupid.

01:32:14.267 --> 01:32:16.052
Not just yet, you don't!

01:32:16.095 --> 01:32:18.445
Not until you tell me
where the rest of the money is.

01:32:20.230 --> 01:32:22.493
Who's holding it for you?

01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:23.799
Tell me!

01:32:23.842 --> 01:32:25.322
[whimpers]
It's half.

01:32:25.365 --> 01:32:28.455
Liar! Get the fuck outta here!

01:32:28.499 --> 01:32:32.068
'"I'll always
take care of you, Paul.'

01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:33.591
'I love you, Paul."'

01:32:33.635 --> 01:32:34.984
[dramatic music]

01:32:35.027 --> 01:32:37.508
"I owe you so much, Paul."

01:32:38.465 --> 01:32:41.468
Liar! Liar! Liar!

01:32:42.339 --> 01:32:43.470
'Liar!'

01:32:45.777 --> 01:32:48.650
'I don't think you've ever known
how much I love you.'

01:32:50.173 --> 01:32:52.349
'Well, maybe now you will.'

01:32:52.392 --> 01:32:53.698
[gun cocks]

01:32:56.048 --> 01:32:58.964
[music continues]

01:33:05.623 --> 01:33:08.104
You think I'm faking, don't ya?

01:33:08.147 --> 01:33:10.193
You don't think I'd do it,
do ya?

01:33:13.718 --> 01:33:15.328
You think I'm a coward.

01:33:20.943 --> 01:33:22.771
[sobbing]

01:33:29.647 --> 01:33:30.866
Okay.

01:33:35.131 --> 01:33:37.046
[sobbing]

01:33:40.049 --> 01:33:43.226
Let's not hurt each other
anymore, please.

01:33:48.013 --> 01:33:49.580
Well, please.

01:33:51.713 --> 01:33:54.629
Too small-time for you now, huh?

01:33:57.327 --> 01:34:00.286
You slept with him last night.

01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:01.636
Didn't ya?

01:34:03.376 --> 01:34:04.551
Answer me.

01:34:05.727 --> 01:34:06.902
Didn't ya?

01:34:08.468 --> 01:34:10.253
Sure you did.

01:34:10.296 --> 01:34:13.212
You fucked the big director.

01:34:14.474 --> 01:34:16.955
- Well, now me.
- Paul!

01:34:16.999 --> 01:34:18.522
I'll give you a chance to judge.

01:34:18.565 --> 01:34:22.004
A chance to see
who the real man is!

01:34:22.047 --> 01:34:23.614
[screaming]

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:25.268
Stop it! Paul! Hey!

01:34:25.311 --> 01:34:26.922
[Dorothy screaming]

01:34:26.965 --> 01:34:29.881
[crying]

01:34:41.545 --> 01:34:44.461
[Dorothy breathing heavily]

01:34:48.726 --> 01:34:51.642
[sobbing]

01:35:30.855 --> 01:35:32.204
[sobbing]

01:35:41.257 --> 01:35:42.606
[chuckles]

01:35:44.303 --> 01:35:48.220
You're gonna do me
a big favor, huh?

01:35:51.397 --> 01:35:52.529
Okay.

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.012
That's me, a charity case.

01:35:58.883 --> 01:35:59.971
[groans]

01:36:01.712 --> 01:36:05.063
Now, try to think of dear Aram
if you can.

01:36:17.075 --> 01:36:20.383
They're killing me.
They're trying to kill me.

01:36:22.167 --> 01:36:25.083
[Dorothy sobbing]

01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:31.046
[Dorothy sobbing]

01:36:37.966 --> 01:36:40.272
Those bastards!

01:36:41.578 --> 01:36:44.494

01:37:08.170 --> 01:37:11.086
[camera shutter clicks]

01:37:20.182 --> 01:37:21.923
Operator, could you check
on a number for me?

01:37:21.966 --> 01:37:23.620
I think it's out of order.

01:37:23.663 --> 01:37:24.969
[woman on phone]
'What's the number, sir?'

01:37:25.013 --> 01:37:28.277
474-5051.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.322
- 'Hold on.'
- Okay.

01:37:32.411 --> 01:37:33.760
[telephone ringing]

01:37:35.371 --> 01:37:38.287
[telephone ringing]

01:37:42.944 --> 01:37:44.684
Can you hear me?

01:37:44.728 --> 01:37:46.904
[telephone ringing]

01:37:46.948 --> 01:37:48.079
They did this.

01:37:49.167 --> 01:37:50.516
[gunshot]

01:38:02.877 --> 01:38:04.922
My queen.

01:38:04.966 --> 01:38:07.707
'Her name's Billie Joan Worth
and she's very sweet.'

01:38:07.751 --> 01:38:10.275
I was thinking
she's a maybe for November.

01:38:10.319 --> 01:38:11.973
Where's she from?

01:38:12.016 --> 01:38:14.062
- Davenport, Iowa.
- I like her.

01:38:14.105 --> 01:38:16.542
[man on TV]
'Well, Bill, she's a technician
for a pharmaceutical company'

01:38:16.586 --> 01:38:20.024
'who likes all sports, reading
and photography. Joanne..'

01:38:20.068 --> 01:38:21.417
You want sugar?

01:38:22.548 --> 01:38:23.898
Um, a little, please.

01:38:26.596 --> 01:38:28.990

01:40:02.431 --> 01:40:05.042
[male #11]
Now that people recognize you,
what's, what's it like?

01:40:05.086 --> 01:40:06.391
[Dorothy]
Oh.

01:40:06.435 --> 01:40:07.784
I'll go shopping in the store

01:40:07.827 --> 01:40:09.133
and I'll see people going

01:40:09.177 --> 01:40:11.092
"Hey, that's Dorothy Stratten".

01:40:11.135 --> 01:40:13.572
Or, "Hey, can we have
a picture of you?"

01:40:13.616 --> 01:40:15.139
"Can we have an autograph?"

01:40:15.183 --> 01:40:16.662
Or even in the airport

01:40:16.706 --> 01:40:18.795
you know,
people rushing up to me

01:40:18.838 --> 01:40:20.275
to get my autograph
or something.

01:40:20.318 --> 01:40:22.494
That's really exciting for me.

01:40:22.538 --> 01:40:25.454

01:40:54.831 --> 01:40:57.747
[music continues]

01:41:26.515 --> 01:41:29.431
[instrumental music]

01:41:58.721 --> 01:42:01.637
[music continues]

01:42:31.406 --> 01:42:34.322
[music continues]

01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:05.266
