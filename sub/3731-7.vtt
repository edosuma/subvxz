00:20.806 --> 00:24.392
[eclectic orchestral theme plays]

02:51.290 --> 02:52.707
[Nomi] This isn't a fair fight.

02:52.791 --> 02:55.877
We need to level the playing field
and that's what this guy does.

02:55.961 --> 02:57.670
[Neets] And you trust him?

02:57.754 --> 02:59.631
Because you were hackers together?

02:59.714 --> 03:02.717
Because he got caught
hacking the Pentagon during the war.

03:02.801 --> 03:04.677
Couldn't have been very serious.

03:04.761 --> 03:07.055
- It was.
- Then why isn't he in jail?

03:08.140 --> 03:10.350
Because I took the fall for him.

03:17.440 --> 03:21.945
I was a juvenile. I had rich parents.
I got off with community service.

03:26.366 --> 03:30.411
I never told you because I didn't think
that I would ever have to revisit

03:30.495 --> 03:31.788
this part of my life.

03:36.335 --> 03:38.253
I'm sorry.

03:39.212 --> 03:40.255
[guard] Attention.

03:49.306 --> 03:51.724
This is Prisoner 773.

03:51.808 --> 03:53.393
Teach her the rules.

03:59.816 --> 04:01.484
[woman] It is her.

04:02.568 --> 04:03.611
Here he comes.

04:08.491 --> 04:12.371
- The embezzler.
- You stole all of those investors' money?

04:12.453 --> 04:16.333
[tsking] Shamed your father and brother.

04:16.416 --> 04:18.543
And almost destroyed their company.

04:24.507 --> 04:25.884
Well done.

04:30.222 --> 04:31.931
[van door slams]

04:33.975 --> 04:35.143
[Nomi] Hey, Bug.

04:36.769 --> 04:37.896
Where's Mike?

04:39.522 --> 04:42.859
It's me. I'm... Mike.

04:42.942 --> 04:44.652
Oh, shit.

04:44.736 --> 04:46.321
Fuck!

04:47.280 --> 04:51.492
Right, totally forgot.
I'm a fucking idiot.

04:52.369 --> 04:56.206
'Course it's you, buddy! [laughs]

04:57.707 --> 04:59.167
'Course it's you.

04:59.251 --> 05:04.505
Not you, like the old you,
like a new, hot version of you.

05:04.589 --> 05:06.966
Shit, Mike.

05:07.050 --> 05:11.054
You're a total fox!
I would do you! I would.

05:11.137 --> 05:14.057
I would totally-- I mean not like,

05:14.140 --> 05:18.770
not in a degrading way, like that sounded,
but total compliment.

05:18.853 --> 05:21.189
- Thank you.
- Her name's Nomi.

05:22.190 --> 05:23.816
OK.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.236
- Who's this?
- This is my girlfriend.

05:27.404 --> 05:31.074
- Seriously? Shit!
- Bug.

05:31.157 --> 05:32.367
Right.

05:33.285 --> 05:35.328
Business.

05:35.412 --> 05:37.247
Everything you need.

05:39.207 --> 05:40.333
Right here.

05:40.417 --> 05:44.212
Hey, look, if you guys are startin'
some crime-fightin' super-team

05:44.296 --> 05:47.257
Charlie's Angels shit,
you count me in.

05:47.340 --> 05:50.760
OK. Let's start you off
with some switch hooks.

05:50.843 --> 05:52.345
I need a candygram and a feedtrough

05:52.429 --> 05:54.639
that'll burrow through
any firewall ever built.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.558
Things are gettin' exciting.

05:57.642 --> 05:59.227
And how about a waterwitch?

05:59.311 --> 06:01.980
No, but I do have...

06:02.063 --> 06:04.107
A Ragemaster?

06:04.190 --> 06:06.192
That's NSA grade.

06:06.276 --> 06:08.861
Serious hard-on when that showed up.

06:08.945 --> 06:11.490
Yeah. I know what you mean.

06:14.075 --> 06:16.328
Is all of this equipment illegal?

06:16.411 --> 06:21.749
Well, with this kind of technology,
legality is a bit of a moving target.

06:21.833 --> 06:25.837
- Ah.
- I figure justice is as justice does.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.006
If the government
can use this shit to spy on us,

06:28.089 --> 06:30.925
why shouldn't we be able to spy on them?

06:32.135 --> 06:33.886
Missed you, buddy.

06:34.929 --> 06:39.642
I married my husband
when I was 22 years old.

06:42.395 --> 06:45.524
I felt like I was a very lucky woman.

06:46.899 --> 06:48.693
Then he lost his job.

06:50.529 --> 06:53.031
And he started drinking.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.993
And then... beating me.

06:58.495 --> 07:03.833
I could guess how bad the beating would be
by the hands of the clock.

07:05.043 --> 07:07.420
Time was a source of terror.

07:08.796 --> 07:15.220
But in here, every moment
spent free of that man is a gift.

07:17.514 --> 07:21.184
But... why are you here?

07:21.267 --> 07:26.647
Because I put rat poison in his bibimbap
and killed the motherfucker.

07:28.107 --> 07:30.360
She did her husband, too.

07:32.404 --> 07:34.197
He was a bad man.

07:36.241 --> 07:37.992
And you?

07:38.076 --> 07:42.205
I pushed my father's wheelchair
down an elevator shaft,

07:42.288 --> 07:44.165
with him still in it.

07:46.209 --> 07:51.839
In this country, sometimes the only place
you can find a brave and honest woman

07:51.923 --> 07:53.174
is in prison.

08:00.098 --> 08:03.684
You guys have been so good to me.

08:03.768 --> 08:05.686
I just want to do something for you.

08:05.770 --> 08:08.273
Hernando, I know you've been dying
to come to this restaurant

08:08.356 --> 08:10.609
ever since Lito talked about the food.

08:10.691 --> 08:14.195
I saw you and your little
emoticon sad face.

08:14.279 --> 08:16.239
- [Hernando chuckles]
- Hm?

08:16.322 --> 08:22.412
But here you are... out in the world,
sitting next to each other.

08:22.495 --> 08:24.080
[plate rattling]

08:24.163 --> 08:27.667
Come on! Let's enjoy it.

08:27.750 --> 08:28.960
This is not working, Daniela.

08:29.043 --> 08:30.753
We went to the wrestling thing together.

08:30.836 --> 08:32.713
- It's different.
- Why?

08:33.714 --> 08:36.676
Because that was a guy thing,
and this is a romantic restaurant?

08:36.759 --> 08:38.136
Exactly.

08:41.556 --> 08:43.933
- You worry too much.
- [Lito sighs]

08:44.016 --> 08:46.478
This is totally working.

08:46.561 --> 08:49.230
If a photographer comes up
or someone that wants an autograph,

08:49.314 --> 08:52.400
all Hernando has to do
is stand up and glower at them,

08:52.484 --> 08:56.195
and I guarantee everyone in this room
will believe he's your new bodyguard.

08:56.279 --> 08:59.782
- I-- I can glower. I-- I can do that.
- [Daniela] See?

09:01.867 --> 09:03.995
[hushed giggling, chatter]

09:05.830 --> 09:09.917
- Hi. Um... can we take a picture?
- [Daniela clearing throat]

09:11.294 --> 09:13.212
I'm sorry, Mr. Rodriguez is busy.

09:13.296 --> 09:15.965
- It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.
- [stammers] Oh-- Oh, OK.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.635
Thank you. Hi.

09:19.844 --> 09:21.387
[cameras clicking]

09:22.847 --> 09:25.475
- OK.
- Thank you very much.

09:29.312 --> 09:31.356
- We have to go.
- This is my fault.

09:31.439 --> 09:32.773
- It was my fault.
- It isn't your fault.

09:32.857 --> 09:34.693
- Relax.
- [Lito] Let's go, please.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.736
[camera shutters clicking]

09:37.945 --> 09:41.199
The man is eating. Leave him in peace, OK?
Leave him in peace!

09:49.999 --> 09:51.626
Oh, my God!

09:52.835 --> 09:54.420
- [softly] How was it?
- So good!

09:54.504 --> 09:56.506
[whispers] I... I believed it.

09:56.589 --> 09:58.508
I mean, I fully believed it.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.177
I believed it, too.

10:01.260 --> 10:02.512
[all laughing]

10:21.447 --> 10:23.866
[Capheus] Oh, my God. [laughs]

10:24.534 --> 10:26.035
Clouds!

10:26.118 --> 10:28.829
Look at them! So close.

10:30.164 --> 10:32.124
Beautiful.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.334
[laughs]

10:34.252 --> 10:36.128
How amazing is this, huh?

10:36.796 --> 10:39.006
I've never been on a plane.

10:39.090 --> 10:40.800
Hey, you are so lucky.

10:40.883 --> 10:42.719
No, I'm not lucky.

10:42.802 --> 10:46.931
Of course you are.
You are flying, above clouds.

10:47.014 --> 10:50.017
Privileged, not lucky.

10:51.603 --> 10:54.146
You are lucky 'cause you are
still able to see your father.

10:55.356 --> 11:00.111
That is something I dream about,
but will never happen again.

11:00.945 --> 11:02.739
I'm sorry.

11:02.822 --> 11:05.116
It's OK.

11:05.199 --> 11:09.287
I lost my father,
but I still have my mother.

11:11.247 --> 11:13.916
I wish I could see the world that simply.

11:13.999 --> 11:17.920
Riley, look out of the window.

11:18.003 --> 11:21.006
Those are actual clouds.

11:25.386 --> 11:29.140
But what if something terrible happens
because of me going back?

11:30.642 --> 11:34.771
What if something wonderful happens? Eh?

11:36.188 --> 11:38.149
[chuckles]

11:38.232 --> 11:40.485
First class, huh? It's nice.

11:41.778 --> 11:43.321
[chuckles]

11:56.584 --> 11:58.085
[laughing]

12:05.343 --> 12:06.552
[whispers] I love you.

12:06.636 --> 12:08.220
[elevator dings]

12:10.222 --> 12:14.059
Mr. Gonzalez! How are you doing?

12:14.143 --> 12:18.105
My new bodyguard, Hernando.
My girlfriend, Daniela.

12:19.315 --> 12:21.192
You'll be seeing a lot of them.

12:28.533 --> 12:30.034
[laughing]

12:35.164 --> 12:37.709
[upbeat melody on ukulele]

12:45.341 --> 12:47.426
[singing "Baba O'Riley"]

13:09.574 --> 13:12.201
Hi, Pop. [laughs]

13:15.371 --> 13:18.416
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too. [giggles]

13:19.918 --> 13:22.712
- Thank you.
- [father whispers indistinctly]

13:23.462 --> 13:26.298
[chattering, laughing]

13:26.382 --> 13:27.926
[shrieks, giggles]

13:29.134 --> 13:33.598
OK, OK, you have to admit
that was the best night out of your lives.

13:33.681 --> 13:37.059
[Hernando]
This, this was our first night out ever.

13:37.142 --> 13:38.436
Ever.

13:38.519 --> 13:42.147
- [Lito] Champagne. Orange juice.
- [masked man] Welcome home!

13:42.231 --> 13:46.819
- [chuckles] Make you a drink?
- What the fuck are you doing here?

13:46.903 --> 13:49.488
"The fuck"? [grunts]

13:51.449 --> 13:53.785
The fuck is the reason that I'm here.

13:53.868 --> 13:56.036
Lito, call the police.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.831
Hey! [tsking]

13:59.582 --> 14:04.629
I know I'm the bad guy,
that's why I wore this mask.

14:05.296 --> 14:07.006
[whispers] But this is not the real me.

14:07.089 --> 14:08.716
Shh.

14:15.097 --> 14:16.390
See?

14:17.349 --> 14:19.727
I'm not the bad guy.

14:21.312 --> 14:23.564
I'm the sad guy.

14:25.691 --> 14:29.153
- You're drunk.
- You're gonna have to leave, Joaquin.

14:29.236 --> 14:33.407
Enter the hero. The big hero.

14:33.491 --> 14:35.075
[laughs]

14:35.159 --> 14:39.831
The man every guy wants to be
and every girl wants to fuck.

14:39.914 --> 14:42.000
Don't touch him.

14:42.082 --> 14:45.920
Oh. Who's the tough guy? Huh?

14:46.004 --> 14:48.798
He's my bodyguard, Joaquin. So, please.

14:48.881 --> 14:51.258
He just broke a photographer's arm.

14:51.342 --> 14:53.678
There's been enough violence for tonight.

14:53.761 --> 14:56.347
That's cool. Cool, cool.

14:56.430 --> 14:58.307
No violence.

14:58.390 --> 15:01.060
I don't want no violence.

15:01.143 --> 15:03.228
What do you want, Joaquin?

15:05.731 --> 15:10.402
I wanna know what I did wrong
and what he did right, that's all.

15:10.486 --> 15:13.781
For starters... Lito's never hit me.

15:13.865 --> 15:16.367
Wait, that's not fair.

15:16.450 --> 15:18.619
This is Mexico. I am a man.

15:18.703 --> 15:20.579
I was raised that way.

15:20.663 --> 15:24.166
You hit your woman
to make her respect you. Fuck!

15:24.249 --> 15:27.003
Well, Lito's twice the man you'll ever be!

15:30.422 --> 15:31.883
I know.

15:36.554 --> 15:39.473
Oh, fuck. I know.

15:39.557 --> 15:41.642
That's why I'm here.

15:42.601 --> 15:43.769
Why?

15:43.853 --> 15:48.190
[sighs]
Because I want to see it for myself.

15:48.273 --> 15:51.151
Wanna be a better footballer,
watch the best.

15:51.235 --> 15:56.115
Wanna be a better baller...
do the same.

15:56.198 --> 15:57.533
What?

16:04.540 --> 16:07.376
I wanna see you fuck her, Lito.

16:07.459 --> 16:08.627
Jesus Christ!

16:08.711 --> 16:13.549
I know how it sounds, but please!

16:13.632 --> 16:15.885
Give the guy a break.

16:15.968 --> 16:18.137
You're the better man. You won.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.639
You fucked her away from me.

16:22.141 --> 16:26.353
So I just thought maybe I could
learn how to fuck her back,

16:26.437 --> 16:30.649
or at least how to fuck the next her
away from someone else.

16:30.733 --> 16:34.361
- That's it. I'm calling the police.
- Oh, no, no. Please. No, wait! Hey!

16:34.445 --> 16:36.989
Listen to me. Wait, Dani. Listen to me.

16:39.158 --> 16:42.244
Leave it! Leave it!
Get the fuck out of here!

16:42.327 --> 16:45.831
- [Hernando] That's it.
- [Joaquin] I don't want to go.

16:45.915 --> 16:48.960
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.
Please. OK, I'm going. I'm going.

16:49.835 --> 16:52.755
Lito, fuck her in good health!

16:54.506 --> 16:56.926
[Hernando locks door]

16:59.470 --> 17:00.638
[sighs]

17:02.181 --> 17:03.599
My bodyguard.

17:06.978 --> 17:08.854
I'm feeling very
Whitney Houston right now.

17:08.938 --> 17:10.106
[laughs]

17:11.356 --> 17:12.399
[chuckles]

17:20.240 --> 17:22.868
Amanita never told me
she was dating Robin Hood.

17:22.952 --> 17:26.413
[chuckles]
Nom's got this whole secret identity, Mom.

17:26.497 --> 17:30.250
Silicon Valley nerd by day,
political hacktivist by night.

17:30.334 --> 17:33.253
- She tried to go straight--
- Hey, I would never go straight.

17:33.337 --> 17:37.591
[laughs] She tried to play by the rules,
and they tried to lobotomize her.

17:40.845 --> 17:44.515
I'm sensing a bit of a negative vibe here.
You guys picking up on this?

17:44.598 --> 17:47.601
Your Spidey sense tingling
or something, 5-0? [chuckles]

17:48.644 --> 17:50.604
Maybe this wasn't
the most prudent decision.

17:50.688 --> 17:52.606
- We'll be all right.
- Y'all just need to be cool

17:52.690 --> 17:53.899
and let me do the talkin', a'ight?

17:53.983 --> 17:57.361
You know, I still can't believe
how you're just taking this all in stride.

17:57.444 --> 18:01.073
If someone told me they were hearing
other people's voices in their heads,

18:01.157 --> 18:03.450
I'd be sure they slipped off
their medication.

18:03.534 --> 18:04.994
Child of the '60s.

18:05.077 --> 18:08.122
If you didn't hear voices at least once,
you were doing something wrong.

18:08.206 --> 18:10.041
- You sure you got the right kid?
- [scoffs]

18:10.124 --> 18:12.626
- I never seen him with your crew.
- That's the point. He's an eye.

18:12.710 --> 18:15.462
You're not supposed to see him,
but he sees you.

18:15.546 --> 18:18.174
Like the man says,
when you look into the ghetto...

18:19.217 --> 18:20.968
the ghetto looks back at you.

18:21.052 --> 18:25.305
[mother] There was a time when people
who heard voices were considered saints.

18:25.389 --> 18:28.184
It wasn't a sign of madness,
it was a sign of the miraculous.

18:28.851 --> 18:31.353
Still is, as far as I'm concerned.

18:31.436 --> 18:32.646
[chuckling]

18:34.857 --> 18:35.858
[man] Oh, yeah!

18:35.941 --> 18:38.861
- Game time! You niggas are sweet!
- [man] Yeah!

18:38.944 --> 18:41.113
Yeah!

18:44.700 --> 18:45.701
[silent mouthing]

18:54.168 --> 18:55.669
Oh, shit.

18:56.295 --> 18:58.756
Ludicrous Lincoln. Fuck me.

19:00.841 --> 19:02.718
Why'd it have to be Lincoln?

19:02.801 --> 19:04.344
You and Lincoln got history or somethin'?

19:05.637 --> 19:09.016
My boy got all Romeo
with the former Ms. Ludicrous.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.768
[DeShawn] Damn, Will!

19:13.395 --> 19:14.730
When Nita was very young,

19:14.813 --> 19:18.943
I took her to her first July 4th picnic,
and she got scared by the fireworks.

19:19.026 --> 19:21.653
Still hate 'em.
Why celebrate with symbols of war?

19:21.737 --> 19:25.032
- Wars are always a failure.
- Yes, honey.

19:25.116 --> 19:28.327
But she got frightened,
and before I knew it, she was gone.

19:28.410 --> 19:31.538
Lost. A million people around me.

19:31.622 --> 19:35.500
I felt this panic starting to rise up,
but before it hit,

19:35.584 --> 19:38.796
I suddenly could hear her.

19:38.879 --> 19:40.005
Not her voice.

19:40.089 --> 19:44.384
It was the sound that she used to make
when she slept against my chest.

19:45.719 --> 19:50.266
- Aw.
- It was a... a feeling, or a vibration,

19:50.349 --> 19:52.851
and I-- I followed it straight to her.

19:52.935 --> 19:54.436
Waffle cone stand.

19:54.519 --> 19:56.814
I'm a simple girl. [laughs]

19:56.897 --> 20:00.901
No one believed me when I told them
how I found her, but it didn't matter.

20:00.985 --> 20:02.278
I knew what had happened.

20:02.903 --> 20:05.405
I'm one of those people
who's comfortable with the idea

20:05.489 --> 20:08.784
that there's more going on in this world
that we don't understand

20:08.867 --> 20:10.535
than all the things that we do.

20:10.619 --> 20:15.040
Hey, you know I'm askin' myself,
can this be that Officer Gorski?

20:16.167 --> 20:20.921
The very same Officer Gorski
that tried to stick his pork

20:21.005 --> 20:22.631
- into my motherfuckin' pussy?
- OK--

20:22.714 --> 20:24.925
- Shut the fuck up, Officer Gorski!
- Back the fuck up.

20:25.009 --> 20:27.970
Uh-uh. Nah, man. Ludicrous,
you gave me your word that you--

20:28.053 --> 20:29.805
Word don't mean shit to this punk.

20:29.888 --> 20:32.224
Let's all remember that
he has somethin' you want,

20:32.308 --> 20:33.934
you got somethin' he want.
C'mon, man.

20:38.022 --> 20:40.149
You know the fundamental
nature of the universe

20:40.232 --> 20:42.318
is not competition, Officer Gorski.

20:42.401 --> 20:45.363
No? What is it then?

20:46.405 --> 20:48.115
Commerce.

20:49.825 --> 20:51.702
[Neets] Find anything new on Metzger?

20:51.785 --> 20:55.206
Checking his travel records,
he has been all over the world.

20:55.289 --> 20:58.876
London, Istanbul, Switzerland,
Seoul, and Iceland.

20:58.959 --> 21:01.503
- Hm.
- And these are his insurance records,

21:01.586 --> 21:03.881
basically his work history
over the past year.

21:03.964 --> 21:06.217
You're looking for the operation
he was gonna do to you.

21:06.300 --> 21:10.304
Exactly. He's performed it three times
in the Bay area.

21:10.388 --> 21:12.139
What happened to the patients?

21:14.099 --> 21:15.934
Two of them died.

21:17.936 --> 21:19.230
And the third?

21:19.313 --> 21:20.689
What is it you want?

21:20.772 --> 21:22.816
- Diplomatic immunity.
- What?

21:22.900 --> 21:24.526
We want you to leave us the fuck alone.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.030
That includes your motherfuckin' pork.

21:28.113 --> 21:30.074
Fuck this shit.
How about we haul you in right now

21:30.157 --> 21:33.369
- for obstructing a federal investigation?
- [Will] Nobody's arresting anybody.

21:34.703 --> 21:36.705
If the information is good...

21:39.124 --> 21:42.502
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Niles Bolger.

21:42.586 --> 21:44.755
- He's a patient here.
- And you are?

21:44.838 --> 21:46.048
I'm his niece.

21:51.929 --> 21:54.765
4K, show him.

21:58.102 --> 21:59.144
[Will] All right.

22:00.438 --> 22:03.065
- You saw the van pull up?
- I knew somethin' was up.

22:03.148 --> 22:04.566
Smelled like the Feds.

22:04.649 --> 22:07.403
- They pull anything out of the building?
- Check it.

22:10.030 --> 22:11.490
Who's in the bag?

22:11.573 --> 22:13.325
Still unidentified at this point.

22:14.993 --> 22:17.329
- You get the license plates?
- Of course I got the plates.

22:17.413 --> 22:19.164
What you think we are,
amateur hour and shit?

22:19.248 --> 22:21.333
[men chuckling]

22:22.709 --> 22:24.086
I'll start a trace.

22:26.213 --> 22:28.382
[4K] Oh, yeah. Scary dude.

22:28.466 --> 22:31.760
The way he talked and everybody jumped,
figured he was the big dog.

22:31.843 --> 22:33.929
Hey, you know this dude, 5-0?

22:53.949 --> 22:56.327
The procedure was performed
by Dr. Metzger, right?

22:56.410 --> 23:00.205
Yes, Dr. Metzger
personally handled Mr. Bolger.

23:09.840 --> 23:12.176
Uncle Niles, it's me, Nomi.

23:28.025 --> 23:29.943
No-- Thank you.

23:32.321 --> 23:33.447
Nom!

23:34.114 --> 23:35.824
[Nomi sobs]

23:41.663 --> 23:42.789
Wha--?

23:47.336 --> 23:49.380
That could be me.

23:50.548 --> 23:51.631
It's not. You're here.

23:51.715 --> 23:54.426
Just promise me that no matter
what you have to do,

23:54.510 --> 23:56.636
you will not let that happen to me.

23:59.348 --> 24:00.599
Promise?

24:02.434 --> 24:04.144
I promise.

24:04.853 --> 24:06.063
[sniffling]

24:16.198 --> 24:19.826
I'm just saying that if our equipment
was used in some sort of criminal act,

24:19.910 --> 24:22.454
- clearly, we're not responsible.
- Clearly.

24:22.538 --> 24:25.374
- We'll need to know who rented this.
- Paperwork's in the back office,

24:25.457 --> 24:27.543
but without some sort of
warrant or something--

24:27.626 --> 24:29.169
The warrant's gonna go to your bosses.

24:29.253 --> 24:32.047
Probably have to file with corporate, too?
Just to be thorough.

24:32.130 --> 24:34.049
- Yeah.
- Trust me, man, you do not want that.

24:34.132 --> 24:36.134
I'll make a copy. Here it is.

24:36.218 --> 24:38.136
Can you open it, please?

24:38.220 --> 24:41.640
They brought it back real clean.
Most thorough clean-up job I've ever seen.

24:41.723 --> 24:43.767
- Not a spot on it.
- I'll bet.

24:49.648 --> 24:51.858
Hey, whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

24:51.942 --> 24:53.318
You OK?

24:55.404 --> 24:56.738
No, I'm good.

25:05.163 --> 25:08.083
From the day I decided to marry Rajan,

25:08.166 --> 25:11.545
you have been sending me... visions.

25:12.337 --> 25:16.675
You sent me a vision of a woman
taking her own life.

25:18.135 --> 25:21.721
Visions of other people in distant places,
even in prison,

25:21.805 --> 25:24.182
which could perhaps be a metaphor
for my situation,

25:24.266 --> 25:26.768
intended for education and instruction.

25:27.936 --> 25:32.983
But then, you sent me a vision of a man...

25:33.984 --> 25:35.902
with a large...

25:39.948 --> 25:41.158
trunk?

25:44.161 --> 25:45.912
A very large trunk.

25:47.706 --> 25:50.208
I am a little more than confused.

25:51.710 --> 25:52.836
[sighs]

25:52.919 --> 25:56.173
But... I trust you, Ganesha.

25:56.256 --> 26:00.969
So I know there must be some meaning
to all of this that I cannot see.

26:01.052 --> 26:04.014
And I wish to see. I wish to understand.

26:06.224 --> 26:08.686
So help me, Ganesha.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.438
Help me see what it is I must do.

26:11.522 --> 26:13.773
Gods don't give a shit about us.

26:13.857 --> 26:16.818
[thunder rumbling]

26:17.986 --> 26:19.779
I speak from experience.

26:23.241 --> 26:27.037
- Why won't you just leave me alone?
- I tried.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.997
Believe me, I try not to think of you,

26:29.080 --> 26:31.082
but every time,
it brings me straight to you.

26:35.671 --> 26:37.422
At least...

26:38.882 --> 26:40.217
you're wearing clothes.

26:40.300 --> 26:41.426
[laughs]

26:43.053 --> 26:44.095
[chuckles]

27:06.535 --> 27:08.119
It's nice here.

27:09.287 --> 27:12.123
[chuckles] The weather's shit in Berlin.

27:14.668 --> 27:16.587
It rains like this in Bombay...

27:18.046 --> 27:20.298
but it's not so cold there.

27:31.476 --> 27:35.522
So tell me... does he ever help?

27:36.523 --> 27:38.692
- What?
- Your god.

27:38.776 --> 27:41.069
- Oh. Of course.
- How?

27:41.903 --> 27:45.198
I asked him to stop my wedding,
and he did.

27:45.282 --> 27:47.659
You think he stopped your wedding?

27:48.577 --> 27:51.747
Do you have a better explanation?

27:52.872 --> 27:57.335
So you think our connection...
is a kind of miracle?

28:00.964 --> 28:03.508
If I were trying to describe
this feeling...

28:04.718 --> 28:08.806
the sensation of experiencing
the warmth of the sun,

28:08.888 --> 28:11.015
the smell of jasmine and marigold...

28:12.892 --> 28:18.356
while at the same time being soaked
by a downpour at an outdoor café...

28:28.116 --> 28:32.329
the taste of strong coffee
still in my mouth...

28:34.748 --> 28:40.712
I would say that the word "miracle"
sounds particularly appropriate.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.466
Wouldn't you?

28:44.549 --> 28:48.970
[slow classical piano music]

29:17.791 --> 29:18.834
You slept well?

29:21.294 --> 29:23.380
Best sleep I had in a long time.

29:34.265 --> 29:37.728
- I made pancakes.
- Yeah?

29:38.228 --> 29:41.189
- [changes to up-tempo tune]
- [giggles]

30:05.839 --> 30:07.716
That boy is one of them.

30:07.799 --> 30:10.552
He's from Jaluo, the same as his father.

30:10.635 --> 30:11.803
His father is dead.

30:12.679 --> 30:15.849
Wh-- Where do you want us to go?
Where can we go?

30:15.933 --> 30:17.141
[man] Send him back then.

30:17.225 --> 30:19.310
But he's my son.

30:19.978 --> 30:21.479
He belongs with his own people.

30:22.355 --> 30:24.566
[old man] It is best for everyone.

30:30.697 --> 30:33.784
- Shiro! Please don't do this.
- Let her go.

30:33.867 --> 30:35.577
God damn you.

30:35.660 --> 30:38.580
God damn your tribes and your bad blood!

30:38.663 --> 30:41.082
You can all go to hell.

30:50.091 --> 30:54.805
During your time of stay, you will
complete female vocational training.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.767
Can you sew, Prisoner 773?

30:58.850 --> 31:01.645
- No.
- Did your mother neglect you?

31:02.562 --> 31:05.398
- My mother died.
- Oh.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.403
You are very lucky, 773.

31:10.487 --> 31:12.071
Here, you'll receive training.

31:12.155 --> 31:13.740
Who will be her teacher?

31:13.824 --> 31:15.575
Volunteer?

31:17.577 --> 31:20.497
Or I will assign one.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.165
Pardon, ma'am.

31:24.876 --> 31:26.127
I will be her teacher.

31:26.210 --> 31:29.923
773, move to this table.

31:33.927 --> 31:36.220
- You know the rules.
- Yes, thank you.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.398
[softly] You didn't have to help me.

31:48.483 --> 31:49.651
I know.

31:51.028 --> 31:52.863
[Riley] Smells so good, Papa.

31:55.573 --> 31:58.827
- You're not having one?
- No, I ate hours ago.

31:58.910 --> 32:02.622
I wanted you to wake up smelling them,
but you must have been really tired.

32:05.042 --> 32:07.585
I've been watching you on the Internet.

32:07.669 --> 32:10.171
- You've had a lot of shows. Doing well.
- Mm.

32:10.254 --> 32:14.425
Oh, it's nothing, just playing records
for drunk people trying to get laid.

32:14.509 --> 32:16.135
Playing Beethoven's the same, you know.

32:16.219 --> 32:19.723
The people are mostly too old and tired
to bother with the getting laid part.

32:19.806 --> 32:20.932
[chuckles]

32:22.059 --> 32:24.143
You make music, Riley,

32:24.227 --> 32:27.939
and for a moment,
people forget the troubles in their lives.

32:28.023 --> 32:30.984
It's no small thing.
I'm very proud of you.

32:31.068 --> 32:33.277
Thanks, Papa.

32:33.361 --> 32:35.613
I have to get to rehearsal.

32:36.865 --> 32:40.994
If you need to go out, Sven is next door,
and he can drive you anywhere.

32:41.078 --> 32:42.704
I thought he would be out on his boat.

32:42.787 --> 32:44.664
He heard you were coming,
dropped everything.

32:46.207 --> 32:49.210
I told Sven I don't care
if anybody shows up tomorrow,

32:49.293 --> 32:50.670
as long as my daughter's there.

32:55.967 --> 32:57.719
I'll see you, honey. Bye-bye.

32:57.802 --> 32:59.930
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Papa.

33:04.517 --> 33:07.311
[woman] You should not have come back.

33:16.613 --> 33:18.782
[Kala] I was always afraid as a child.

33:19.824 --> 33:24.203
I couldn't sleep if the light was off
or if it was too quiet.

33:24.287 --> 33:25.914
I don't like the quiet.

33:27.540 --> 33:30.293
I used to fall asleep
in my father's restaurant.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.635
I've always hated being alone.

33:41.179 --> 33:44.307
It's one of the reasons
why I love the festival.

33:44.975 --> 33:48.145
[up-tempo instrumental music plays]

34:15.005 --> 34:16.547
Mommy!

34:16.631 --> 34:18.257
Papa!

34:22.637 --> 34:24.014
Mommy!

34:24.097 --> 34:25.306
Papa!

34:25.389 --> 34:27.851
Come! This way! Come!

34:41.906 --> 34:44.075
- Do you like this? Come on, here!
- Yes!

34:50.540 --> 34:52.917
Do you want to see what he sees?

34:53.001 --> 34:54.669
What who sees?

34:54.752 --> 34:56.587
Ganesha.

34:59.090 --> 35:00.258
Come, come.

35:08.641 --> 35:09.726
Look there!

35:48.472 --> 35:50.225
It made me a believer.

35:51.392 --> 35:54.020
But you're a scientist.

35:54.104 --> 35:55.230
I am.

35:57.232 --> 36:00.610
My love for science
doesn't preclude my faith.

36:00.693 --> 36:02.946
For me, science is another language we use

36:03.029 --> 36:06.741
to talk about the same miracles
that faith talks about.

36:08.118 --> 36:12.747
But... one language makes sense,
one doesn't.

36:14.498 --> 36:18.169
Sense? What, like quantum physics?

36:18.253 --> 36:21.756
Like a particle
that can be here and not here?

36:21.839 --> 36:24.467
Or sense like gravity?

36:26.385 --> 36:29.513
A force that no one knows why exists.

36:31.808 --> 36:34.978
Only that if it didn't exist...

36:38.356 --> 36:43.236
if there wasn't this
mysterious attraction...

36:46.405 --> 36:49.826
this pull between objects...

36:52.745 --> 36:56.374
then none of this would exist either.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.461
Thank God for gravity.

37:01.879 --> 37:03.089
Exactly.

37:05.383 --> 37:07.844
Hey, Wolfie. Where the fuck are you?

37:07.927 --> 37:09.387
What?

37:11.597 --> 37:15.101
- [sighs] I heard from Abraham.
- And?

37:16.311 --> 37:18.980
He'll take the rest of the diamonds.

37:19.063 --> 37:20.481
- [laughs]
- When?

37:20.564 --> 37:23.442
I don't know,
but we're going to be fucking rich!

37:24.610 --> 37:28.323
- Hey! This is great fucking news!
- It is.

37:28.406 --> 37:31.784
So why do you look like
someone took a piss in your beer?

37:33.577 --> 37:36.247
I've been thinking I want to
get out of Berlin for a little while.

37:36.914 --> 37:39.334
- Oh.
- I need to take a trip.

37:39.417 --> 37:40.501
Where?

37:43.296 --> 37:44.505
India.

37:49.135 --> 37:53.181
No, go around to the other side,
or the thread will break again.

37:58.811 --> 38:01.105
Ssst! [whispers] She's coming.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.456
See you outside, bitch.

38:19.874 --> 38:21.418
Or not.

38:29.467 --> 38:31.261
Does this happen often?

38:32.845 --> 38:34.805
Only when the sun is out.

38:43.398 --> 38:46.317
Don't get into any trouble, Diana Prince.

38:47.193 --> 38:48.903
Mr. Kabaka wants to see you.

38:48.986 --> 38:50.447
Dad's here?

38:54.451 --> 38:56.827
Dad, you came to pick me up!

38:57.787 --> 38:59.914
How could I leave you alone
on your birthday?

38:59.997 --> 39:01.665
I know you're just pretending to forget.

39:01.749 --> 39:04.335
- [Silas chuckles]
- Happy birthday. You could have told me.

39:04.419 --> 39:06.254
You know I like my secrets.

39:06.337 --> 39:08.465
She is like her father.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.217
And now, I have a little surprise for you.

This is what our relationship has come to?

39:58.722 --> 40:00.558
I didn't text you.

Oh, my God.

40:13.404 --> 40:15.198
The son of a bitch
must have stole my phone.

40:15.281 --> 40:18.951
- You took pictures of us?
- You took pictures of us having sex?

40:22.038 --> 40:25.416
This could destroy my career,
my whole life.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.626
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.337

40:35.259 --> 40:37.428
He could blackmail me.

40:37.512 --> 40:40.181
- He's gonna blackmail me.
- [Daniela] No, no. No, no. I--

40:40.264 --> 40:43.226
- We'll figure this out.
- No, I'm gonna talk to him.

40:43.309 --> 40:45.144
I'll get the phone,

he comes in for a coffee

41:06.790 --> 41:08.251

We are creatures of habit.

Enter the creature.

Right on time.

41:25.518 --> 41:27.103
What does that thing do again?

41:27.186 --> 41:31.065
It uses its own network to clone the phone
that he's using with this one.

41:31.982 --> 41:33.401
What if he doesn't check his e-mail?

41:33.484 --> 41:35.903
Ever not checked your e-mail
while waiting for a coffee?

41:38.739 --> 41:39.740
Ooh!

41:40.408 --> 41:44.787
I'm in. Downloading contacts,
e-mails, calls, passwords.

42:02.639 --> 42:04.098
[Metzger] What?

42:12.148 --> 42:13.566
He looked scared.

42:13.650 --> 42:17.111
Makes you wonder who was
on the other end of that call.

42:17.194 --> 42:20.864
Contact list shows "Dr. Matheson."

I don't know, but he knew me.

42:47.642 --> 42:49.852
Shit.

42:50.811 --> 42:53.523
Metzger's booked
on the last flight to Chicago.

42:53.606 --> 42:56.275
[Neets] OK, what does that mean?

42:56.359 --> 43:00.154
- He's not gonna be in his house tonight.
- You're crazy, you know that?

43:00.237 --> 43:02.281
I have to get into his home network.

43:02.365 --> 43:03.741
If these people know who I am,

43:03.824 --> 43:06.285

She has a big heart.

43:48.619 --> 43:50.079
I would do anything for her.

43:53.832 --> 43:56.126
It's the same with you
and your mother, yes?

43:58.713 --> 44:00.130
Come with me.

44:04.260 --> 44:08.305
This love... my enemies
would call a weakness,

44:08.389 --> 44:10.015
something to be exploited.

44:10.099 --> 44:12.309
I disagree.

44:12.393 --> 44:15.730
I mean, these men,
what do they hold in their hearts, huh?

44:15.813 --> 44:20.484
Desire... lust... greed.

44:22.403 --> 44:27.408
But I ask... are these men willing to go
as far as you and I for what they believe?

44:30.536 --> 44:31.995
This one...

44:35.708 --> 44:38.127
This one I was grooming
to be my number one runner.

44:38.877 --> 44:40.755
Do you know what he did?

44:43.924 --> 44:47.970
He watered down the drugs I gave him
so he could double-up on the money.

44:48.053 --> 44:52.767
My reputation is only as good
as the products I sell.

44:54.644 --> 44:56.228
Mr. Kabaka, I--

44:56.312 --> 44:58.939
[Silas] Am I willing
to let my business perish,

44:59.022 --> 45:04.153
to let the life I've made for my daughter
be destroyed by greed and stupidity?

Wow, it worked!

45:33.432 --> 45:35.309
You read that in a book?

45:35.392 --> 45:37.561
The power of literature.

45:44.067 --> 45:45.528
[alarm disarms]

45:45.611 --> 45:47.780
Amazing. Do you know what else
I read in a Lee Child book?

45:47.946 --> 45:50.991
That you can use the crowbar as an alarm.

45:52.034 --> 45:53.828
So if anyone pushes the door,
we'll hear it.

45:53.911 --> 45:55.621
We make such a good team.

45:55.705 --> 45:59.750
Maybe Bug's right and we should become
a crime-fighting dynamic duo.

45:59.834 --> 46:01.293
I think we already are.

46:14.973 --> 46:15.933

There's almost nothing personal.

This guy's about as interesting
as a mouthful of sawdust.

46:33.075 --> 46:35.160
He doesn't even have
any porn stashed away.

46:35.244 --> 46:38.163
No porn? He is weird.

46:38.247 --> 46:42.376

46:42.459 --> 46:44.503

47:15.409 --> 47:17.745
- What happened?
- [softly] I don't know what happened.

47:18.454 --> 47:19.789
Nothing happened.

It's the nothing that has me worried.

47:21.624 --> 47:23.375
You went to see Abraham?

47:23.459 --> 47:26.921
I did. Or at least I tried to.

47:27.004 --> 47:29.339
- We had a date.
- He didn't show?

47:29.423 --> 47:32.509
No. So I called. Nothing.

It's not done. It's not done yet.

before they arrive.

Hi, Dr. Metzger.

49:28.667 --> 49:29.668
Whatever brought you here,

49:29.752 --> 49:33.964
I'm happy to see that you had a...
moment of sufficient clarity

49:34.048 --> 49:37.676
to seek me out to get the treatment
that you... need.

49:37.760 --> 49:39.344
It shows there's still time to help you.

I can have an ambulance here
in five minutes.

gonna need an ambulance.

unless you put that phone down.

in Nightingale's.

50:02.159 --> 50:04.453
Yes... I know.

50:04.536 --> 50:07.164
I'm guessing that's the reason
my trip was canceled.

50:07.247 --> 50:08.791
Who canceled it?

50:08.874 --> 50:10.250
Was it Dr. Matheson?

How do you know that name?

50:15.464 --> 50:17.133
She jacked your phone.

I called him. We had a little chat.

- Oh, no.
- Who is he, doc?

What have you done?

- You've gotta get out of here.

- Why?
