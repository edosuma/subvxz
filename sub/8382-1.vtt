clear that Natasha wants

04:52.426 --> 04:54.760
to be closer to Yuri.

04:54.762 --> 04:58.664

football scholarship.

05:31.165 --> 05:36.234

of my freshman year,

05:36.236 --> 05:39.071
I blew my knee out.

05:39.073 --> 05:42.107
And that ended that dream.

05:42.109 --> 05:46.345
And that same fall,
I took English 101.

05:50.117 --> 05:54.653

and Hemingway and Fitzgerald

05:54.655 --> 05:59.291
and he encouraged me to write.

05:59.293 --> 06:03.395

new creative journey.

gritty details.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.609
Now that is writing.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.345
Why'd I come to LA?

06:53.347 --> 06:55.247
Um.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.748
Because I knew you were
here and you'd lend me

06:56.750 --> 06:59.317
a hundred bucks if
I asked ya, right?

06:59.319 --> 07:00.652
Right? C'mon.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.624
Thank you, babe.

07:07.326 --> 07:09.161
I already got her number.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.196
Maybe I'll text her.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.098
Maybe I won't.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.466
I don't know.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.334
I'm an optometrist in glendale.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.103

07:28.615 --> 07:29.648

07:34.253 --> 07:36.588
Right now I have two unpublished

07:36.590 --> 07:41.460

07:41.462 --> 07:44.663
It's called <i> pizza to go.</i>

07:44.665 --> 07:50.669
It's about a guy named
Scott who meets all these

07:50.671 --> 07:54.206
interesting characters.

07:54.208 --> 08:00.378
Um, I'm pretty happy with
what I've got so far.

08:00.380 --> 08:05.750

pages long right now.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.185
And I'm stuck.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.455
I haven't written in two weeks.

08:10.457 --> 08:16.061
Hannah keeps teasing me
about my writers block.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.597
I think about her a lot.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.632
She's all I think about.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.134
I really want to ask her out.

08:23.136 --> 08:27.038
My latest project is called
<i>sleeping on the moon.</i>

08:27.040 --> 08:29.674
It is about pain and rejection.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.376
And, oh...

08:31.378 --> 08:33.745
It's not about a moon.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.547
It's confusing.

08:35.549 --> 08:40.751
But actually the moon
part is more of a...

08:41.687 --> 08:44.256
You know? It's not
really what it is.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.624
It's not an actual...

08:45.626 --> 08:48.693
No one's sleeping on the moon.

08:48.695 --> 08:53.565
But there's a word for that.
It's a um...

08:53.567 --> 08:55.467
You know? Um, um.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.568
Metaphor.

08:56.570 --> 09:00.238
That was actually crawling out
of my mouth, metaphor, so...

09:00.240 --> 09:01.740
Thanks, ma.

09:01.742 --> 09:05.610
John k butzin has one agent
that is very interested in

09:05.612 --> 09:09.247
<i>roaring lion </i> and there's a
publisher up in oxnard

09:09.249 --> 09:12.017
who's reading it as we speak.

09:12.019 --> 09:16.488
Plus, there's a certain cousin
who has a best friend who has

09:16.490 --> 09:21.259
a neighbor that has an in
with Mr. Clint Eastwood,

09:21.261 --> 09:25.697
so it looks like <i> roaring lion</i>
will be roaring at the

09:25.699 --> 09:29.534
I'm just not sure how the other
members of the writing group

09:29.536 --> 09:33.505
are going to handle so much
success by one person.

09:33.507 --> 09:37.008
I just hope they don't all turn
out to be a bunch of pussies.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.278
I am here because of bukowski.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.113
Charles bukowski.

09:42.115 --> 09:46.017
Greatest writer ever.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.485
Period.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.087
LA is his town, man.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.590
I mean, if I'm going to be
a writer then I need to

09:51.592 --> 09:54.426
walk in bukowski's shoes.

plight of the working class.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.407
You're right.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.775
I'm more of an idea guy.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.043
Mmhmm.

10:12.045 --> 10:15.347
You know, I get
these great ideas...

10:15.349 --> 10:20.418
But I don't always
follow through. You know?

10:20.420 --> 10:21.419
In a lot of things.
Not just writing.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.555
I'll show you. I'll show you.

10:28.494 --> 10:33.031
Idea for romantic novel.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.232
No.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.534
Make that idea for
romantic e-book.

10:36.536 --> 10:37.702
Right?

10:37.704 --> 10:40.639
It's just... you know,
the times.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.010
Frovers.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.547
They couldn't be friends.

10:49.549 --> 10:52.283
They couldn't be lovers.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.552
So they became frovers.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.754
Oh my God.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.357
Honey.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.459
That just, right now
that came to you?

11:01.461 --> 11:02.460
It did. It just did.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.361
Baby.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.329
I know. I love you.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.597
I'm so...

11:05.599 --> 11:08.566
It's just the idea that they
couldn't, if they couldn't be

11:08.568 --> 11:12.404
this one or this one, but
then you take that word,

11:12.406 --> 11:14.039

11:14.041 --> 11:18.410

Favorite writer.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.986
Wow, that's a tough one.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.288
You know I've studied
more composition

11:30.290 --> 11:34.259
over actual literature.

11:34.261 --> 11:37.762
But Ms. Maureen over here,
I know she loves a writer

11:39.766 --> 11:42.434

11:45.104 --> 11:46.538

12:07.761 --> 12:10.495
It's so world war ii.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.397
I found her at a hardware store.

12:12.399 --> 12:16.034

came out with a prime candidate

12:16.036 --> 12:20.538

most in America.

becomes Mrs. John k butzin. Ya?

12:55.742 --> 12:57.675
Yeah. The people in the
group are great.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.111
They're ok.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.280
They can't write for shit.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.182

13:09.756 --> 13:11.990
I'm juggling a lot
of stories right now.

13:11.992 --> 13:15.226
One is- is about- one I
can't because I'm afraid of

13:15.228 --> 13:17.095
like copyright infringement.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.429
Yeah, that's a worry
that we have that if we

13:18.431 --> 13:20.365
say our material-
-if we say our ideas-

13:20.367 --> 13:21.599

gonna be a problem?

13:21.601 --> 13:24.636

13:30.677 --> 13:34.445
He's, uh, written seven novels.

I'm the leader,
the group leader.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.003
After all, getting

14:11.784 --> 14:15.019
This is where I come
for inspiration.

14:15.021 --> 14:20.225
I believe that every writer
needs to have a place

14:20.227 --> 14:24.329
where they can have some
tranquility and peace

14:24.331 --> 14:25.730
[loud crash]

14:25.732 --> 14:27.398
And solitude.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.344

write in my journal.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.714
This is where the
magic happens for me.

14:52.525 --> 14:56.461
I wanted to help Colette.

14:56.463 --> 15:00.031
Oh, I certainly enjoy the
creative process I do.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.733
But Colette?

15:01.735 --> 15:04.669
Writing is her dream.

15:04.671 --> 15:08.072
And I'd do anything
for her because...

15:08.074 --> 15:10.041
Because she's my dream.

22:21.574 --> 22:28.713
It's inspired by a story
that I heard from a massage

22:28.715 --> 22:32.149
client of mine named Yuri.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.086
Yuri.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.320
Shhh.

22:36.588 --> 22:38.255
Favorite author?

22:38.257 --> 22:41.025
Oh, that question again.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.594
I still don't have an answer.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.296
There are so many.

22:45.298 --> 22:49.066
Who would of thought that
I used to do massage?

22:49.068 --> 22:51.502
I know. No, it's true.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.739
In fact that's how I met
Alan for the first time.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.774
Although don't let him tell
you any differently because

22:56.776 --> 22:58.509
I know that he will try.

22:58.511 --> 23:04.248
It's absolutely not true that
I gave him the kind of massage

23:04.250 --> 23:06.717
that he really wanted.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.519
'Cuz I didn't.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.755
I did not give him...

23:10.757 --> 23:13.124
At least not the
first time I didn't.

23:13.126 --> 23:17.728
Absolutely. I have
morals and values.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.499
Bottom line is if Hannah
can get an agent, so can I.

23:21.501 --> 23:24.135
So yeah, I am superstitious.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.704
I know, I'm guilty.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.140
I'm very drawn
to the number four.

23:29.142 --> 23:33.744
I was born on 4:04
pm on April fourth.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.713
Yeah, four four four four.

23:35.715 --> 23:38.616
I mean, that is not an accident.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.251
No way.

23:40.253 --> 23:41.619
Things I like to avoid.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.521
Well, black cats,
broken irrors,

23:43.523 --> 23:45.456
and the number thirteen.

23:45.458 --> 23:48.025
Yes, I do not like
the number thirteen.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.127
And everbody that knows
me knows that I do not

23:50.129 --> 23:51.295
like the number thirteen.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.464
Even though three
plus one is four.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.132
And I do like four.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.668
So it's a fine line.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.537
Everybody has a technique.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.072
And this is mine.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.775
A writer has to hear everything.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.711
On the streets.
In the restaurants.

24:08.413 --> 24:12.082
My dialogue has to be so
real, that I'm everywhere.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.251
Standing behind you at
the check out stand.

24:14.253 --> 24:16.687
Peeing next to
you at the urinal.

24:16.689 --> 24:17.688
Oh yeah.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.457
I watch.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.258
I listen.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.760
Writing down scraps
of conversation.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.261
-You're writing what
we're saying.

24:24.263 --> 24:25.296
That's right.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.198
I eavesdrop.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.666
Gotta love it.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.401
That's me.

24:30.403 --> 24:31.569
Simple.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.070
Real.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.405
Powerful.

24:34.407 --> 24:36.207
An artist.

24:36.209 --> 24:38.442
These are my rejection letters.

24:38.444 --> 24:41.378
Rejected by agents.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.447
Rejected by publishers.

24:43.449 --> 24:47.151
When I think about it,
it's kind of depressing

24:47.153 --> 24:50.488
how many ways people
can reject you.

24:50.490 --> 24:54.725
This is- this is probably a
rejection letter, you know?

24:54.727 --> 24:56.694
I can't do this today.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.562
I can't open this letter.

24:58.564 --> 25:00.598
I take rejection so personally.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.367
I'll bet it's good news.

25:03.369 --> 25:05.202
You think?
-I think.

25:05.204 --> 25:09.340
It could be.
-Ok

25:09.342 --> 25:12.476
I think it could be too.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.345
Because today is the day.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.779
That's the spirit.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.184
Oh.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.421
Can you read it?

25:25.156 --> 25:27.458
Uh...

25:27.460 --> 25:29.059
Sorry not interested.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.094
That's what it says, right?

25:30.096 --> 25:32.296
Yeah. Yeah.

25:34.766 --> 25:37.501
Well remember the pink one?

25:37.503 --> 25:39.136
It was way smaller
than this one was.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.038
Yes, it was. It was a lot
smaller.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.506
A lot smaller.

25:42.508 --> 25:46.110
I think that because it's
getting bigger, it could be...

25:46.112 --> 25:47.211
Progress.

25:48.079 --> 25:48.612
Right?

25:48.614 --> 25:50.581
That's right.

25:53.685 --> 25:55.085
I'll save this one.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.620
I'm gonna save this one.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.390
[Knocking]

25:59.392 --> 26:01.158
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.160
I don't know who that could be.

26:03.162 --> 26:03.761
It's ok.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.096
Hi Maureen how are you?

26:06.098 --> 26:07.298
Hello everyone.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.365
Colette's here!

26:08.367 --> 26:09.533
Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry.

26:09.535 --> 26:10.467
I didn't know they were here.

26:10.469 --> 26:11.468
Hi guys.

26:11.470 --> 26:12.770
You look so dressed up.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.104
Oh thank you.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.105
You look fantastic too.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.575
I thought I'd bring something
I picked up for my

26:17.577 --> 26:20.010
new favorite author.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.412
There's a note.

26:21.414 --> 26:25.282
"Poodles, now may we have
sex again?" Love Alan.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.051
What mom?

26:27.619 --> 26:28.719
That is amazing.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.620
You're welcome.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.455
Oh gosh, I know what it was.

26:31.457 --> 26:34.425
Really quick I just wanted to
ask about your new agent honey.

26:34.427 --> 26:35.426
Oh, mmhmm?

26:35.428 --> 26:38.495
Is he taking on new clients?

26:38.997 --> 26:41.665
Oh, you know what, I don't know.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.000
Could you ask?

26:43.002 --> 26:45.069
'Cuz you know?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.203
I mean if he is...

26:46.205 --> 26:48.405
You know?

26:48.407 --> 26:51.442
Yeah, maybe I could-
could probably do that.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.477
Ok good.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.413
Maybe we can talk about
this at the meeting?

26:58.183 --> 26:59.383
You're right.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.086
Absoultely. Absoultely.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.387
[Fake laughing]

27:03.389 --> 27:04.221
Yeah.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.090
Ok.

27:07.225 --> 27:10.394
Oh, I guess I should go.
It's time.

27:10.396 --> 27:12.262
Thanks Maureen.
-This is so sweet.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.297
You're welcome.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.767
Everything is gluten free,
because you know at our age,

27:16.769 --> 27:19.036
honey, it's time to start
being healthy, right?

27:19.038 --> 27:20.070
You know?

27:20.072 --> 27:21.338
When you're young.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.473
You should start young.

27:22.475 --> 27:23.774
Ok, muah.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.242
Congratulations, sweet pea.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.176
Thank you.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.411
Bye guys, see you!

27:27.413 --> 27:28.312
Ohh.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.446
Careful there.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.314
I've not been drinking.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.015
Ohh.

27:31.017 --> 27:31.615
Too much.

27:31.617 --> 27:33.317
Haha.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.053
Ahhh.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.322
Oh my goodness. Colette mooney.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.425
She really is something.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.260
Yes.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.295
Colette mooney.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.998
That girl, she...

27:49.701 --> 27:54.638
C-o-l-l-t-t-e-m-o-o-n-e-y.

27:55.573 --> 27:58.208
That's thirteen letters.

27:59.110 --> 27:59.677
Out.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.345
Out it goes.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.680
It's ok.

28:02.682 --> 28:05.282
I'm not- Colette...

28:05.284 --> 28:07.718
She's not scary, so...

28:09.521 --> 28:11.221
[Phone ringing]

28:13.191 --> 28:14.391
Hannah.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.693
Henry. How are you?

28:15.695 --> 28:18.062
Oh, thank you for
seeing me Alan.

28:18.064 --> 28:18.662
Of course.

28:18.664 --> 28:20.497
No problemo.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.166
Let's get you some new eyewear.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.170
I need something that
makes me look smart.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.471
Ok.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.040
You're already smart Hannah.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.613
This will be perfect.

28:37.315 --> 28:39.750
Why don't you try these?

28:39.752 --> 28:41.085
Ok.

28:43.121 --> 28:44.421
Ehh.

28:44.423 --> 28:45.489
Nah.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.725
Excuse me one sec.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.994
Name for character.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.596
Alexander brown.

28:52.598 --> 28:55.099
Wears brown colored glasses.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.667
Well of course he would.

28:57.202 --> 29:00.237
You know this great idea for a
novel came to me this morning.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.172
It's called <i> woof</i> .

29:02.174 --> 29:03.674
It's about...

29:06.077 --> 29:07.611
[Laughing]

29:07.613 --> 29:10.647
It's about a dog who becomes
human for 24 hours in order to

29:10.649 --> 29:13.317
rescue his kidnapped owner.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.152
Hannah, I love this idea.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.120
Could be a winner.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.755
Yeah, you think so?

29:20.692 --> 29:22.092
Do you like these?

29:22.094 --> 29:22.760
You look great.

29:22.762 --> 29:26.296
Do you think you're agent might
be interested in this idea?

29:26.298 --> 29:27.331
Does he have a dog?

29:27.333 --> 29:30.400
Or a cat. It could be a cat.
We could call it <i> meow.</i>

29:30.402 --> 29:33.737
Just think about
mentioning it to him, ok?

29:33.739 --> 29:38.308
Dog or cat becomes human.

29:38.743 --> 29:41.211
I brought you out here because
I would like you to meet

29:41.213 --> 29:44.782
someone who is super duper
important to me.

29:44.784 --> 29:48.252
He is my spiritual advisor.

29:48.254 --> 29:52.289
Dr. xiroman has taken a
year's vow of silence

29:52.291 --> 29:54.525
to protest climate change.

29:54.527 --> 29:56.160
It's just amazing.

29:56.162 --> 30:01.231
He's here today to cleanse
the air of this icky, icky

30:01.233 --> 30:03.400
negative rejection energy air.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.370
So please.

30:07.438 --> 30:10.073
Mm mm.

30:10.075 --> 30:12.709
There's a lot more air,
so you can keep going.

30:16.214 --> 30:17.347
That's it?

30:20.051 --> 30:21.752
[Phone ringing]

30:22.387 --> 30:23.654
Hello?

30:23.656 --> 30:24.721
Oh hi!

30:24.723 --> 30:26.557
It's Bryan.

30:27.025 --> 30:29.226
Yes, I'm sitting down.

30:29.228 --> 30:30.360
What?

30:30.695 --> 30:31.728
Oh my God.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.564
Oh my God, oh my God.

30:33.566 --> 30:35.032
Are you serious?

30:35.034 --> 30:35.766
He sold my novel.

30:35.768 --> 30:37.634
Oh!

30:37.636 --> 30:40.604
Shhhh. Oh my God,
I'm here, yes.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.538
How much?

30:41.540 --> 30:43.106
Wow, ok great.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.541
Ok, ok, we'll talk tomorrow.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.610
Ok, thanks Bryan.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.412
Oh!

30:49.214 --> 30:50.514
Wow, Hannah.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.282
Well, we gotta tell the group.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.618
Oh no, no, no. I
don't want to do that.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.653
It'll sound like I'm bragging.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.722
And I already got the agent.

30:58.724 --> 31:00.023
Why don't you let me tell them?

31:01.393 --> 31:05.329
Yeah, yeah,you know, they'll
hear it from me first,

31:05.331 --> 31:07.097
and it won't be a thing.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.765
Thank you, Henry.

31:08.767 --> 31:10.767
What would I do without you?

31:12.304 --> 31:16.473
Her and her little
book deal and all.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.309
But it just so happens that
John k butzin has some

31:19.311 --> 31:22.579
news of his own to announce.

31:23.681 --> 31:27.784
I have just inked a deal
with "u r the publisher".

31:27.786 --> 31:31.188
A reputable firm based in...

31:31.190 --> 31:33.023
Well it's overseas.

31:33.025 --> 31:37.494
But they publish
5,000 titles a year.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.596
I'm going to give them $250.

31:39.598 --> 31:45.702
They're gonna format and publish
my novel <i> roaring lion</i> .

31:46.704 --> 31:50.240
Next step, Hollywood.

31:52.510 --> 31:55.178
Hannah's just lucky. That's all.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.713
Guys, here she comes.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.248
Here she comes.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.483
Get ready, get ready.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.151
Surprise!

32:01.153 --> 32:05.455
Ohh! So sweet! Really?

32:05.457 --> 32:08.158
Oh that's so sweet,
you guys. Thanks.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.426
First one published
gets a free eye exam.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.696
Thank you so much.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.098
Wait to go, miss
published author.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.234
Thank you.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.568
Big hug there.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.437
We're all jealous Hannah.

32:20.439 --> 32:21.438
Just teasing you.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.473
No seriously, we're all jealous.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.008
Look, you guys are making
way too much of this.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.643
Really.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.412
So when does the book come out?

32:28.414 --> 32:30.547
A year. They said about a year.

32:30.549 --> 32:31.615
How much you get?

32:31.617 --> 32:32.416
Don't ask her that.

32:32.418 --> 32:33.450
Why not?

32:33.452 --> 32:35.218
How much do you get?

32:35.220 --> 32:38.221
Uh, actually I did ok.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.023
Yeah?

32:40.025 --> 32:41.391
Yeah, just leave it at that.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.026
But hey, I owe all of
this to you guys.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.028
I'd be so lost with
out this group.

32:45.030 --> 32:49.633
I don't know if anybody heard,
but "u r the publisher"

32:49.635 --> 32:53.770
has decided to publish <i> roaring</i>
<i>lion </i> by John k butzin.

32:53.772 --> 32:54.671
"U r the publisher"?

32:54.673 --> 32:55.739
That's right.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.140
Self publishing.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.308
E-books.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.077
They print on demand.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.446
Yes, that's right. That's
exactly what they do.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.781
And I'll have my
book in two weeks.

33:04.783 --> 33:07.084
None of this waiting
around crapola.

33:07.086 --> 33:11.154
John k butzin will be
a published author.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.589
And he'll be published first.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.591
John, congratulations.

33:14.593 --> 33:15.993
Right back at ya, kid.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.328
Two published
authors in the group.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.163
The rest of us are
gonna have to catch up.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.265
[Laughing]

33:22.267 --> 33:23.567
Just-

33:23.569 --> 33:26.303
gunner stared out over
the bleak horizon

33:26.305 --> 33:29.406
seeing one dead Vietcong
after another.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.275
They scattered on
the bloody hillside.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.777
He had won this time.

33:33.779 --> 33:37.147
But gunner knew that Charlie
would be back in the morning.

33:37.149 --> 33:40.350
And by God, he would be ready.

33:40.352 --> 33:44.187
And so would his m60
general purpose machine gun,

33:44.189 --> 33:48.525
and mark 2 fragmentation
hand rifle grenade.

33:49.694 --> 33:52.095
God, that's good stuff.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.464
That's beautiful.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.300
Nicely done, John.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.036
Let's get some feedback.

33:59.038 --> 34:02.773
Ok, well I think in
terms of characters, John-

34:02.775 --> 34:05.042
hold on a minute.
I want to hear from her.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.611
No I don't wanna
hear from everyone.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.312
I want to hear from Hannah.

34:09.313 --> 34:10.746
She has a book coming out.

34:10.748 --> 34:13.216
John k butzin has
a book coming out.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.351
I want to hear from Hannah.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.319
Author to author.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.088
Screw you. Really?

34:18.090 --> 34:22.092
This is really against the
spirit of the group, John.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.592
Everyone's opinion is valid.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.328
Hers is more valid.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.098
What do you say, Hannah?

34:28.100 --> 34:29.366
Um... I...

34:29.766 --> 34:32.702
I'm going outside.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.543
I should probably
go check on him.

34:39.545 --> 34:42.179
Make sure that he is ok.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.786
Let's take a fifteen
minute break, shall we?

34:49.788 --> 34:51.254
Yep.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.425
I'm just gonna go
to the restroom.

34:57.628 --> 35:01.264
You guys need anything else?

35:08.406 --> 35:11.641
Idea for Michael
crichton - type novel.

35:11.643 --> 35:14.377
Members of antarctic
research station attacked

35:14.379 --> 35:16.012
by mutant penguins.

35:16.014 --> 35:17.547
Wait a minute, what was that?

35:17.549 --> 35:20.784
Uh, just an idea
I was working on.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.452
Just uh-

35:22.454 --> 35:23.353
who was that author?

35:23.355 --> 35:24.154
Michael crichton.

35:24.156 --> 35:27.124
Michael chrichton.
Pretty well known author.

35:27.126 --> 35:32.062
Just members of a research team
attacked by mutant penguins.

35:32.064 --> 35:33.697
Really?

35:34.699 --> 35:36.333
We have one rule in this house.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.002
Whatever Colette
wants, Colette gets.

35:39.004 --> 35:40.103
Aw thank you, honey.

35:40.105 --> 35:42.339
If she wants an
audi s4, no problem.

35:42.341 --> 35:43.440
I did, I did.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.474
Credit cards? How many?

35:44.476 --> 35:46.610
Her own business? Done.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.512
An agent?

35:50.214 --> 35:52.516
Call it serendipity,
karma, whatever.

35:52.518 --> 35:55.385
But it just so happens
that very well known

35:55.387 --> 35:57.020
literary agent David kelleher-

35:57.022 --> 35:59.523
-so known. He is so known.
I just-

35:59.525 --> 36:03.426
And guess who's coming in
tomorrow to see doctor

36:03.428 --> 36:06.596
Alan mooney for an eye
exam and new glasses?

36:07.098 --> 36:08.064
It's not me.

36:08.066 --> 36:08.665
It's Donald.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.400
Callahan- no, David?

36:10.402 --> 36:12.702
Kelleher.
David kelleher.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.638
David kelleher.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.406
Anyway what am I
supposed to say to her?

36:16.408 --> 36:19.643
Oh Christ, he says
it's pedantic.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.244
Dr. Alan mooney.

36:21.246 --> 36:24.548
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.

36:24.550 --> 36:27.184
I know. Big fan. Big fan.

36:27.186 --> 36:29.085
Come with me, please.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.454
They're doing a little
documentary about

36:31.456 --> 36:33.323
my writing group.

36:34.625 --> 36:35.458
Really?

36:35.460 --> 36:36.760
Just act natural.

36:37.261 --> 36:39.596
So David, what brings
you hear today?

36:39.598 --> 36:42.098
Near sighted, far sighted.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.768
I do need a prescription
on the reading.

36:46.137 --> 36:48.772
Ok focus on the
"e" for me there.

36:49.340 --> 36:51.374
Obviously you read a lot.

36:51.376 --> 36:52.542
I know that.

36:53.511 --> 36:54.411
You've been getting
any headaches?

36:54.413 --> 36:56.046
No.

36:56.614 --> 37:00.183
Let's see here. Let's see here.

37:00.185 --> 37:04.454
Ok let's do a basic
eye examination.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.723
Read that first line
for me please, David.

37:06.725 --> 37:11.394
L-b-h-k-z-b-c

37:11.396 --> 37:16.333
But anyone can identify
simple letter and numbers.

37:16.335 --> 37:20.337
Let's see how you do reading
a more challenging text.

37:20.672 --> 37:27.344
Natasha the Russian peasant
dressed oh so slowly.

37:27.346 --> 37:31.348
Consumed totally,
completely, absolutely

37:31.350 --> 37:34.284
by endless thoughts of Yuri.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.318
Wow.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.586
Isn't that great writing?

37:36.588 --> 37:38.054
My wife collete wrote that.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.456
The patients just
love reading it.

37:39.458 --> 37:43.193
It's from her new
novel <i> niet, not yet</i> .

37:43.195 --> 37:44.761
[Knocking]

37:44.763 --> 37:45.695
I wonder who that could be.

37:45.697 --> 37:46.696
Hi honey.

37:46.698 --> 37:47.731
Oh my goodness.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.699
I'm so sorry to intrude.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.201
Oh gee Colette.

37:51.203 --> 37:53.103
This is a huge coincidence.

37:53.105 --> 37:56.573
We were just talking about
you and here you are.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.441
Where are my manners?

37:58.443 --> 38:00.410
Colette, David kelleher.

38:00.412 --> 38:03.513
David, Colette
mooney, the writer.

38:03.515 --> 38:06.449
Oh my goodness, it is
such a pleasure, David.

38:06.451 --> 38:09.552
Actually Colette is the one
who wrote this beautiful prose

38:09.554 --> 38:11.288
you've been reading.

38:12.156 --> 38:14.457
Honey, I can't believe
this coincidence.

38:14.459 --> 38:18.061
Yes, I was just dropping the-

38:18.063 --> 38:21.331
oh yes, thank you. Thank you for
dropping that buy.

38:21.333 --> 38:25.335
Say honey, David has just been
reading the first page of yours.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.369
You wouldn't happen to
have any more of that

38:26.371 --> 38:28.638
opening chapter would you?

38:28.640 --> 38:30.573
We're in luck because I think-

38:31.108 --> 38:32.742
say, how 'bout that?

38:32.744 --> 38:35.312
Hey.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.713
How 'bout that?

38:37.748 --> 38:39.349
[Sigh]

38:41.252 --> 38:42.786
Woah that went very well.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.788
Yes, poodles very.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.590
Although he did seem in a
hurry to leave, didn't he?

38:47.592 --> 38:50.560
The sooner he can begin reading.

38:52.630 --> 38:56.099
I'm holding a copy of my book
that you people sent me,

38:56.101 --> 38:59.369
and there seems to be
some kind of a mistake.

38:59.371 --> 39:04.074
Well, you put a dog on the front
cover, instead of a lion

39:04.076 --> 39:05.475
like we agreed upon.

39:06.310 --> 39:09.446
Right. And let me tell ya
something else.

39:09.448 --> 39:13.483
The back page is in Chinese.

39:14.385 --> 39:15.719
Yes, it's Chinese.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.221
I know Chinese when I see it,
ok?

39:18.223 --> 39:22.258
A Chinese assault rifle almost
cost me an eye at hamburger hill

39:22.260 --> 39:25.528
so I know Chinese when I
see it, alright mister?

39:26.464 --> 39:28.365
This is good, Henry.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.632
This is so good.

39:29.634 --> 39:30.734
Yeah, you think so?

39:30.736 --> 39:32.602
Oh yeah.

39:33.437 --> 39:35.438
Do you think it's
ready for the group?

39:35.440 --> 39:38.775
I can't wait to hear what
happens with Scott and kristy.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.610
Those are such great
characters oh thanks.

39:40.612 --> 39:45.382
Thanks. Yeah, I can't wait to
see what happens with them too.

39:45.384 --> 39:48.017
Oh Henry, you'll figure it out.

39:48.019 --> 39:52.622
Hey, uh... you want to take that
drive we talked about?

39:52.624 --> 39:55.091
I um...

39:55.093 --> 39:56.760
I could use some inspiration.

39:58.063 --> 40:04.167
And what in the h-e-double
hockeysticks is chapter eight?

40:04.169 --> 40:08.171
I mean, this- this is about
hormone replacements for women,

40:08.173 --> 40:12.008
and yeast infections, and
braziere sizes

40:12.010 --> 40:13.710
and feminine washes...

40:13.712 --> 40:17.347
How the hell am I supposed to
show this to Mr. Clint Eastwood?

40:17.349 --> 40:20.216
And I want to know what the hell
you are gonna do about it, ok?

40:20.218 --> 40:24.454
Because you sir are dealing
with a decorated veteran.

40:24.456 --> 40:27.457
A decorated combat vet-

40:27.459 --> 40:28.725
yes, I'll hold.

40:34.732 --> 40:36.299
I have to iron out of
a few things.

40:36.301 --> 40:40.403
Very common in the
publishing world.

40:40.405 --> 40:44.007
What really matters here is
that John k butzin is

40:44.009 --> 40:45.708
finally a published author.

40:45.710 --> 40:48.278
Long overdue and well deserved.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.213
Because-

40:52.516 --> 40:57.620
butzin. John k butzin.

40:58.255 --> 41:00.390
So who lives here?

41:00.392 --> 41:02.325
Richard broadwell.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.594
Oh, the writer you like.

41:04.596 --> 41:10.266
Reading Richard broadwell makes
me want to be a better writer.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.501
He's that good.

41:11.503 --> 41:16.105
I haven't really read any of
this stuff, but nice house.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.678
Well here we are.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.648
North Hayworth Avenue,
Hollywood California.

41:27.184 --> 41:29.052
Ok, big clue time.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.153
Sheilah Graham.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.522
Oh yeah.

41:32.524 --> 41:33.122
Right.

41:33.124 --> 41:34.557
Yeah.

41:34.559 --> 41:35.758
Sheila Graham.
-Wow.

41:35.760 --> 41:36.726
Right.

41:36.728 --> 41:39.062
Who was Fitzgerald's lover.

41:39.064 --> 41:45.602
And Fitzgerald died right
here on December 21st, 1940.

41:47.371 --> 41:48.738
Wait, wait wait. Fitgerald?

41:48.740 --> 41:50.473
He's the one who
shot himself, right?

41:50.475 --> 41:51.374
No.

41:51.376 --> 41:53.543
Fitzgerald.

41:53.545 --> 41:54.677
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.446
He wrote <i> the great gatsby</i> .

41:57.548 --> 41:59.349
Come on, you know.

41:59.351 --> 42:01.317
Gatsby. He believed in
the green life.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.086
The orgiastic future.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.220
The year by year-

42:04.222 --> 42:05.188
-I didn't read it.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.156
Come on.

42:07.158 --> 42:09.392
Can we just, like, turn
these off for a second?

42:09.394 --> 42:10.727
Why? What's wrong?

42:10.729 --> 42:12.161
I just...

42:14.498 --> 42:18.568
I have never read
<i>the great gatsby</i> .

42:19.604 --> 42:22.438
Henry, I didn't
go to college, ok?

42:22.440 --> 42:27.710
I mean, I've heard of Hemingway
and twain, somewhere, but I

42:27.712 --> 42:30.613
don't have the smarts and
the education that you do.

42:30.615 --> 42:34.017
I haven't read all
these incredible novels.

42:34.019 --> 42:37.587
My stories, they just
come from my heart.

42:37.589 --> 42:39.489
So tell me about this book.

42:40.991 --> 42:45.061
Gatsby is about social position.

42:45.063 --> 42:48.131
It's about the American dream.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.632
How um...

42:51.602 --> 42:54.737
Actually it's really simple.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.072
Boy meets girl.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.674
Boy loses girl.

42:57.676 --> 43:02.211
And boy tries to move heaven
and earth to win girl back.

Not 100% to sleeping
with writers.

01:06:56.046 --> 01:06:58.646
Oh dear God, it
was research Alan.

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:00.281
Guys, guys! Come on!

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:04.052
Guys, why don't you
just go on ahead?

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:05.754
I'm just saying
it's not, that's all.

01:07:05.756 --> 01:07:07.589
Just, you know, because
there's more of us.

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:10.225
I just simply wanted to say
that I felt that it was unfair.

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:15.163
Let's go, let's go.

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:19.167
Thirteen. Thirteen. Thirteen.
Thirteen. Thirteen.

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:21.770
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

01:07:21.772 --> 01:07:23.371
eleven, twelve, thirteen!

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:28.510
Uf.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.246
Hi.

01:07:31.248 --> 01:07:35.383
I'm a shit for
exploding at Hannah.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:38.420
I'm really sorry.

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:44.259
Poor sweet, superstitious...

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:48.129
She's so superstitious, I
don't know what that is.

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:51.032
Everybody loves Hannah.

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:53.301
I love Hannah.

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:55.770
She's a good girl.

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:59.774
But you know if Hannah
can do it, then so can I.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:04.079
You know, we were born
to succeed not to fail.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.649
Who said that? I don't know.

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:08.516
Somebody famous.

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:09.784
Somebody with an agent.

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:11.753
Haha.

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:13.288
Somebody with an agent,
I'm sure.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.523
And I'll tell you what.

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:19.461
You know, I can't do anything
without an agent, so if

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:22.296
they don't come to me, then
I'm going to go to them.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.238
Your writers block...

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.773
Yeah?

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.542
It's because you're always
focused on everything else.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:35.443
You know?

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.743
Fitzgerald.

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:38.046
Gatsby.

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:43.218
Me.

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:51.392
Listen to me, Henry obert.

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:53.495
The writing must come first.

01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:55.763
You've got to take all
this passion you have

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:57.265
and put it on the page.
You know?

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:59.300
Forget about everything else.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.136
All you're doing is
wasting your talent.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.139
You know what I mean?

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:22.055
From ze books.

01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:29.029
Wow.

01:09:29.032 --> 01:09:31.099
Do you mean that all
of the books at the

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.767
hardware store sold?

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:35.036
Ya. Every one.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:37.138
What did I tell you, strudel?
What did I tell you?

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:40.341
If you write it,
they will read it.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.377
I want you to get some
more books down to that

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.180
hardware store right away.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:46.080
No wait.

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:47.148
Wait a minute strudel.

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:52.020
This is the time
for a book tour.

01:09:52.022 --> 01:09:53.555
A big one.

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:56.024
Bakersfield.

01:09:56.026 --> 01:09:57.025
Fresno.

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:59.027
Stockton.

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:00.528
Yeah, strudel. I want you to get
on the phone and I want you

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.998
to call every one of those
bookstores and you tell them

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.036
that John k butzin,
published author...

01:10:08.038 --> 01:10:10.004
Is on his way.

01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:11.306
Lock and load, strudel.

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:13.107
Lock and load.

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.644
[Sigh]

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:22.784
Auf wiedersehen.

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:32.727
Hello?

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.362
Excuse me?

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:38.032
I'm here to see
Lois pepper, please?

01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:39.534
Hello?

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:42.604
Uh yes, no. Unsolicited.

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:46.774
Um, I just need five minutes.

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:49.677
Just one, two, three, four,
five minutes of her time.

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:54.382
If you could just maybe lean
you're head in a little bit, and

01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:58.786
say my name is Colette
mooney. M-o-o-n-e-y.

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:02.423
I have a manuscript that
I know she's absolutely,

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.292
positively going to want.

01:11:04.294 --> 01:11:05.793
I know she is very busy but-

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:08.429
if I have to read one more
vampire novel, I swear I'm going

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:11.199
to drive a stake through
my own goddamn heart.

01:11:11.201 --> 01:11:12.300
Vampires.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:13.401
Zombies.

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:15.003
Harry Potter knockoffs.

01:11:15.005 --> 01:11:17.105
People writing about their dogs.

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:22.510
manuscript, and it has nothing
to do with vampires or dogs-

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:25.580
doctor xiroman, I
can't believe you're here.

01:11:25.582 --> 01:11:28.082
How lovely to see you again.

01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:30.151
Were you just in
the neighborhood?

01:11:30.153 --> 01:11:32.253
He has taken a vow of silence.

01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:33.721
Please, please come
in for a second.

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:36.090
My family talks about
you all the time.

01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:38.426
You were so helpful
to my sister.

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:44.399
[Whining]

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.301
But...

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:50.638
Oh shit.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.473
Can you believe this?

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.442
Look at my desk, Dr. xiroman.

01:11:54.444 --> 01:11:55.777
Look at it.

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:57.211
It's all crap.

01:11:57.213 --> 01:11:59.180
Crap. Crap. Crap.

01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:00.581
I hate my job.

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.719
I hate my life.

01:12:04.721 --> 01:12:08.289
I envy you, Dr. xiroman.
I mean look at your life.

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:09.524
Your work.

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:11.392
You've really helped my sister.

01:12:11.394 --> 01:12:13.061
You've helped so many people.

01:12:13.063 --> 01:12:16.264
You just have such a positive
message to share.

01:12:16.266 --> 01:12:17.665
He does.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:19.267
Wait a minute.

01:12:19.269 --> 01:12:21.235
Positive message to share.

01:12:21.237 --> 01:12:22.337
Helping people.

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:23.304
That's it!

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:26.040
Dr. xiroman, you
should write a book.

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:28.142
What?

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:31.279
My novel will have to
wait a while longer.

01:12:31.281 --> 01:12:33.748
Niet, Colette, not yet.

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:35.650
But I'll be a co-author.

01:12:35.652 --> 01:12:38.619
Well actually I'll be listed
as junior author.

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:40.755
It's not exactly what I
wanted, but at least now I

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:44.359
finally have an agent
and book deal.

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.029
Thank you.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.543
[Ding dong]

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:08.483
You're late pizza boy.

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:09.550
Sorry.

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.553
Hey, what's this?

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.589
Oh don't worry about them.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.724
They're with me, so...

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:21.162
Your total is $19.65, sir.

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:22.997
There you go.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.301
Hey babe, you got a
single for pizza boy?

01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:28.536
Coming.

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:32.006
Thanks.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.544
Thank you.

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:41.315
No distractions.

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:46.521
Writing comes first.

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:50.158
Henry, I...

01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:54.095
He is making me a
much better writer.

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:56.230
I'll bet he his.

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:59.333
And how much better of a writer
could he be making you, Hannah?

01:13:59.335 --> 01:14:02.403
Why don't you show us?

01:14:02.405 --> 01:14:05.072
Who wrote <i> slaughter house five</i> ?

01:14:05.074 --> 01:14:06.307
Please don't do this.

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:09.677
This could be educational
for all of us.

01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:12.180
How about <i> the native</i>
<i>son, </i> or <i> catch 22.</i>

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:14.449
Why isn't enough
that I'm your friend?

01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:15.583
<i>Lord of the flies.</i>

01:14:15.585 --> 01:14:17.418
<i>Portnoy's complaint.</i>

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.020
Ooh, <i> Harry Potter.</i>

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:21.189
I'll bet you know <i> Harry Potter.</i>

01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:24.025
Why isn't it enough that
I believe in your writing?

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:25.626
<i>Sophie's choice.</i>

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:26.661
Who wrote that?

01:14:26.663 --> 01:14:30.164
Published in the
English language.

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:32.166
It's just not enough that I've
always believed in you.

01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:34.669
You never even read
<i>gatsby. </i> Did you?

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:37.004
Didn't even crack
the book, I bet.

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:38.773
Well...

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:44.278
At least I'm not delivering
pizzas for a living.

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:50.017
So you've read all
these fancy novels.

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:52.587
My book's being published.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.456
Is yours?

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.219
[Typing]

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:27.021
Sorry I'm late.

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.326
What have you got there?

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:34.395
New pages.

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:36.998
I am ready to read.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.500
Way to go Henry.

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:41.369
Have a seat right here.
Hello everyone.

01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:43.404
Who is this guy?

01:15:43.406 --> 01:15:47.475
I have invited my spiritual
advisor, Dr. xiroman,

01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:48.643
to join our writing group.

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:50.244
You must be joking, Colette.

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:52.780
No I'm not joking, Alan.

01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:56.450
The doctor and I will
soon be published authors.

01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:59.020
We have signed with
the Lois pepper agency.

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.055
Yay!

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:05.192
No, you can't do this.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:07.361
But why not?

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:09.397
Because.. Since William is gone
there is an open space.

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:12.033
We all have to agree
on new members.

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:13.501
I don't care about
your silly rules.

01:16:13.503 --> 01:16:14.702
I am the leader of the group.

01:16:14.704 --> 01:16:15.770
Please.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:17.705
I am the leader of the group!

01:16:17.707 --> 01:16:22.543
And Dr. xiroman is my co-author
and he is joining the group.

01:16:22.545 --> 01:16:23.511
He is not.

01:16:23.513 --> 01:16:24.545
Yes he is.

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:26.080
Is not.
-Is too.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.049
Is not!
-Is too!

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:29.717
Stop! Stop!

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:32.620
Sorry.

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:36.023
Um, I just... I have
something I need to say.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.161
Um, I'm leaving this group.

01:16:40.163 --> 01:16:41.462
No you can't leave.

01:16:41.464 --> 01:16:43.431
Hannah, come on, all for one.

01:16:43.433 --> 01:16:46.300
I know, Alan, I'm sorry.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.069
Um...

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:51.639
Richard is going to be
mentoring me now, so...

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:56.577
And today is the twenty second,
so, you know, two and two

01:16:56.579 --> 01:16:59.647
equals four and you know four is
one of my luckier numbers....

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:01.048
Oh gosh.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:02.516
I'm quitting this.

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:05.252
I'm sorry, Alan.

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:08.022
You're just doing this to
upstage the fact that

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:09.457
we've landed an agency.

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:12.493
Yes, this is what it's
all about, isn't it?

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:15.463
The spotlight's always on
little miss sunshine over here.

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:17.698
With her agent and her book
deal and her movie deal,

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.635
and her new iPad.
Didn't miss that!

01:17:20.637 --> 01:17:22.436
I got a news flash
for all of you.

01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:26.007
John k butzin is
saying sayonara.

01:17:26.009 --> 01:17:32.380
This group has done
nothing but stifle the

01:17:32.382 --> 01:17:34.649
creativity of a certain writer.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.083
[Giggle]

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:37.752
What's going on with you two?

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:39.253
He thinks your writing's crap.

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:40.221
Oh really?

01:17:40.223 --> 01:17:44.659
Oh who cares what this phony
balogna whatever he is says

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.794
about anything, alright?

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:51.766
Because there is a certain
Mr. Clint Eastwood.

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:54.001
He's gonna see my writing.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:18:00.041
He's gonna see my writing
when I go on the- the tour.

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:02.643
You know what, I'm
done with all of you.

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:05.646
As far as I'm concerned,
you're all a bunch of pussies.

01:18:05.648 --> 01:18:09.617
Pussy, pussy, pussy,
pussy, pussies.

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:20.594
Get out.

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:22.563
Now.

01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:25.066
As the leader of this group,
I've determined your actions are

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:27.234
contrary to our stated purpose.

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:28.302
Get out.

01:18:28.304 --> 01:18:29.704
You can not throw me out, Alan.

01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:32.707
Then go to your room
and take him with you.

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:37.111
Won't be the first guy.

01:18:37.113 --> 01:18:39.447
Well we certainly will
have a lot to talk about

01:18:39.449 --> 01:18:41.782
You go by yourself. I am done.

01:18:41.784 --> 01:18:43.784
It's just like Alan
to finish first.

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:50.424
I told you it was simply
research, poodles.

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:54.261
I don't understand how all
this could happen. Just...

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.245
Idea for novel.

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:19.253
Here, take it.

01:19:20.455 --> 01:19:22.656
Maybe you can use some of
my ideas in your novel.

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:32.600
[Sigh]

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:34.769
Henry.

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:38.506
Henry, wait.

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:42.209
Henry, I- I wanna read that.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:46.447
Henry, do you think we could
talk for just a second?

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:48.149
Henry, wait!
Henry, Henry.

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:50.251
I'm sorry.

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:04.698
Strudel shipped out.

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:11.005
She wanted to stay, but uh...

01:20:11.007 --> 01:20:13.040
I just didn't have time
for a relationship...

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.709
Especially not now,
you know?

01:20:15.711 --> 01:20:19.079
With the way my book
is selling, you know?

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:23.784
She uh...

01:20:23.786 --> 01:20:28.389
Well she was collateral damage.

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:32.760
Hated it.

01:20:32.762 --> 01:20:34.361
Just hated it.

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:40.067
What a dame.

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:42.136
Sigrid.

01:20:44.639 --> 01:20:50.644
She had the smarts of my first
wife, the body of my second,

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:57.384
and thank God she wasn't
anything like my third wife.

01:20:57.386 --> 01:20:58.752
Yeah.

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:03.023
Yeah, I did the right thing.

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.694
Yeah I did.

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:12.499
But now, all that matters is
that the <i> roaring lion</i>

01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:16.370
book tour is about to begin.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:21.709
And I can't wait to hit the
road, and meet the good people

01:21:21.711 --> 01:21:24.778
of this great nation.

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.748
Good American people.

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:47.501
Isn't it exciting? Wah!

01:21:47.503 --> 01:21:48.636
I'm so nervous.

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:50.304
It's crazy.

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:53.007
I don't really actually
know half the people here.

01:21:53.009 --> 01:21:55.009
Most of them are
Richard's friends.

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:58.145
There he is.

01:21:58.147 --> 01:21:59.446
Over there.

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:02.082
[Sigh]

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:05.252
Nobody's shown up from
my old writing group.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:06.654
Not one.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:09.189
I guess I shouldn't
really be surprised.

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:11.258
I haven't heard from
anyone in months.

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:16.630
Ha. Well you just keep asking
me that, don't ya?

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:20.200
That's funny.
Um...

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:25.239
Yeah, no I still
can't think of one.

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:29.076
I'm going to go over there.

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:32.446
Hey you.

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.081
Thank you so much for coming.

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:35.482
Thank you.

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:39.153
Ok, hi, how are you?

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:41.221
Thank you so much for coming.

01:22:41.223 --> 01:22:43.691
So sweet. Thank you.

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:45.492
Thank you, thank you.

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:47.728
Hey.

01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:49.263
Oh my God.

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:51.665
Hi.

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:53.000
Henry!

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:54.435
Oh gosh, thank you.

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.070
I can't believe you came.

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:58.005
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:22:58.007 --> 01:22:59.573
Hi.

01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:01.041
You're the only one who
came from the group.

01:23:01.043 --> 01:23:04.345
I just can't believe
you came to my signing.

01:23:04.347 --> 01:23:06.747
Well it was hard to miss.
With that article

01:23:06.749 --> 01:23:11.318
about you in people magazine.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:17.024
I just wanted to come by and,
you know, see you and

01:23:17.026 --> 01:23:19.159
tell you congratulations.

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:21.595
I'm really happy for you.

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:25.132
Thank you.

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:27.634
Henry.

01:23:27.636 --> 01:23:29.603
Hello, how are you?

01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:30.671
Hannah, please come back.

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:31.572
Your public.

01:23:31.574 --> 01:23:32.773
Ok.

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:36.210
So, I'll let you get
back to it, huh?

01:23:36.212 --> 01:23:37.711
Please stay.

01:23:37.713 --> 01:23:41.181
No, Hannah, I can't.

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:45.486
I got a date...

01:23:45.488 --> 01:23:48.088
With a flight attendant, so I
shouldn't keep her waiting.

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:52.359
Ok, well I guess you can't stay.

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:54.361
I'm sorry.

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:55.429
Just wait here for one second.

01:23:55.431 --> 01:23:56.730
Hold on.

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:09.710
Oh Hannah.

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:11.011
I want you to have this.

01:24:11.013 --> 01:24:13.347
Please take it.

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.549
Thanks.

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:18.719
Do you want to say
hello to Richard?

01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:20.754
No.
-No.

01:24:20.756 --> 01:24:23.257
Come on Hannah.

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:26.126
Well your public awaits.

01:24:26.128 --> 01:24:27.327
You better go greet them?

01:24:27.329 --> 01:24:27.795
Ok.

01:24:27.797 --> 01:24:29.430
Come here.

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.231
You look beautiful you know.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.366
Hannah, we really do need you.

01:24:32.368 --> 01:24:33.300
[Gasp]

01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:34.268
Woah!

01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:35.269
Oh gosh.

01:24:35.271 --> 01:24:37.171
Richard, Henry. Henry, Richard.

01:24:37.173 --> 01:24:38.338
Big fan.

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:42.409
Well I did it.

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:48.282
I went to Hannah's book signing
and I congratulated her.

01:24:48.284 --> 01:24:49.416
And supported her.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.085
Writer to writer.

01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:53.187
She dedicated her
book to me just like

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:55.322
she said she was gonna.

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:57.791
To Henry obert.

01:24:57.793 --> 01:25:00.327
My forever friend.

01:25:00.329 --> 01:25:01.795
Love Hannah.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.603
It's nice.

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.440
This is why I love LA.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:15.309
True story.

01:25:15.311 --> 01:25:18.345
A guy delivers a pizza
to my house one night.

01:25:18.347 --> 01:25:22.082
The very next week my wife has
someone in to clean the carpets.

01:25:22.084 --> 01:25:23.050
Guess what.

01:25:23.052 --> 01:25:24.118
Same guy.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.018
Hmm.

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.154
Small world, isn't it?

01:25:27.156 --> 01:25:28.689
So we get to talking.

01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:31.125
He tells me his name's
Henry, the writer, who

01:25:31.127 --> 01:25:33.127
just finished a manuscript.

01:25:33.129 --> 01:25:36.763
Offers a discount on the
carpets if I'll read ten pages.

01:25:36.765 --> 01:25:38.599
Now I liked his thinking.

01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:41.201
So I read ten pages.

01:25:41.203 --> 01:25:42.503
Wow.

01:25:42.505 --> 01:25:45.139
Now I want to read ten more.

01:25:45.141 --> 01:25:47.574
Before I knew it, I'd
finished the entire book.

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:52.246
Fresh voice, interesting
characters, and that ending.

01:25:52.248 --> 01:25:55.749
The washed up impotent
novelist gunned down by the

01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:59.286
jealous underemployed
pizza delivery man.

01:25:59.288 --> 01:26:01.021
I mean this kid nailed it.

01:26:01.023 --> 01:26:04.591
It is on the page.
You know what I mean?

01:26:04.593 --> 01:26:07.661
So I want to sign
Mr. Henry obert.

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:10.030
Get <i> pizza to go </i> out there.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.600
I predict a best seller.

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:16.370
Probably a movie too.

01:26:16.372 --> 01:26:19.473
I'll call him with
the good news.

01:26:19.475 --> 01:26:22.075
Or maybe I'll just
order a pizza.

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:24.545
Oh thank you very much.

01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:25.479
You're welcome.

01:26:25.481 --> 01:26:26.747
F Scott Fitzgerald.

01:26:26.749 --> 01:26:28.749
Love, love, love his stuff.

01:26:28.751 --> 01:26:31.051
Yeah. You know Fitzgerald?

01:26:31.053 --> 01:26:33.220
"Gatsby believed in
the green light.

01:26:33.222 --> 01:26:37.491
The orgiastic future that year
by year recedes before us.

01:26:37.493 --> 01:26:39.560
It alluded us then,
but that's no matter.

01:26:39.562 --> 01:26:42.629
Tomorrow we will run faster.

01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:46.300
Stretch out our arms further."

01:26:46.302 --> 01:26:47.568
I love that.

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:48.769
Yeah.

01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:50.003
He died here, you know?

01:26:50.005 --> 01:26:52.472
December 21st, 1940.

01:26:52.474 --> 01:26:54.074
I go by there sometimes.

01:26:54.076 --> 01:26:55.409
The place on Hayworth?

01:26:55.411 --> 01:26:58.178
Is that weird that I do that?

01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.279
I don't know,
people think I'm weird.

01:26:59.281 --> 01:27:00.147
No.

01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:01.114
Do you write?

01:27:01.116 --> 01:27:06.153
I'm actually thinking of
joining a writing group.

01:27:06.155 --> 01:27:09.523
Imagine that. We
both like Fitzgerald.

01:27:09.525 --> 01:27:13.160
So, what is this? Some sort of
reality show or something?

01:27:13.162 --> 01:27:16.396
Oh um, it's a documentary.

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:17.364
Yeah?

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:18.198
Yeah.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.300
Wow, that's interesting.

01:27:20.302 --> 01:27:22.202
What's it about?

01:27:22.204 --> 01:27:24.204
It's about...

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:30.043
♪ ♪

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:42.623
Excuse me. Wait, wait, wait!

01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:44.591
Hi. One more thing.

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:46.526
Remember that question you were
asking me about my favorite

01:27:46.528 --> 01:27:49.296
writer, and I never
had an answer.

01:27:49.298 --> 01:27:52.132
Well it turns out
that I do have one.
