01:24.001 --> 01:27.576
Ah, look at that. Oscar's
waiting for you. Are you nervous?

01:27.601 --> 01:29.361
- Yeah, a little.
- Nah, you'll be fine.

01:29.531 --> 01:31.522
You just show them how we
do it country style, ok?

01:31.547 --> 01:33.521
Hey! Happy Australia Day.

01:33.626 --> 01:35.161
Same to you, mate.

01:37.001 --> 01:39.001
- Hey.
- Hi, love.

01:39.201 --> 01:42.041
- Coming out, old-timer?
- Hey, I'm on duty.

01:44.721 --> 01:46.201
It's a mess out there.

01:46.401 --> 01:47.841
You should have been here yesterday.

01:48.001 --> 01:51.121
I was still unpacking those
boxes. It's a nightmare.

01:53.401 --> 01:54.801
Killer rips out there today.

01:55.001 --> 01:56.881
Yeah, Will's got to learn
how to handle himself.

01:57.081 --> 01:58.721
No-one better than Oscar.

02:00.561 --> 02:02.001
Other than you, Dad.

02:08.041 --> 02:10.601
Alright. Here we go.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.597
Oh!

02:12.681 --> 02:14.761
Look at him. He's a
natural, that young fella.

02:14.961 --> 02:17.241
Look at the balance. Good!

02:17.441 --> 02:18.881
Like Shane.

02:24.161 --> 02:25.641
I'm going to have to go, Dad.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.241
Sorry. Can you take care of Will?

02:27.441 --> 02:29.481
And just make sure he
eats something, yeah?

02:29.681 --> 02:30.881
I will.

02:36.961 --> 02:41.161
Murder victim's name is Mr Haris Rexhaj.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.801
Beaten to death around midnight.

02:45.281 --> 02:48.281
- Who called it in?
- Anonymous, 5am.

02:52.401 --> 02:55.401
- Detective.
- G'day, Jill. This is Tori. She's new.

02:55.601 --> 02:57.321
Detective Constable Lustigman.

03:00.921 --> 03:03.081
No signs of break and enter.

03:06.761 --> 03:08.681
Welcome to paradise, kids.

03:08.787 --> 03:11.161
- Hey, Brenda.
- How are you?

03:13.681 --> 03:17.241
So, judging by the injuries,
the killer restrained the victim,

03:17.441 --> 03:18.721
battered him to death.

03:18.921 --> 03:22.241
- Weapon?
- Blunt object. Possibly curved.

03:22.441 --> 03:23.881
No indents to the flesh,

03:24.081 --> 03:26.681
but injuries to the skull indicate
the assailant was right-handed.

03:26.881 --> 03:28.561
Have you found any restraints?

03:28.586 --> 03:30.761
No. There's more.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.561
Unusual, but he's got
cuts to the testes.

03:32.641 --> 03:35.801
- Jealous lover?
- Possibly premeditated.

03:36.001 --> 03:38.401
The killer's brought the knife with him.

03:38.601 --> 03:40.561
Unless there's one
missing from the kitchen?

03:40.761 --> 03:42.081
No.

03:42.281 --> 03:44.961
Hey, Haris. It's me. Pick up the phone.

03:45.161 --> 03:47.401
I know you're there.
I can see the lights.

03:47.601 --> 03:49.441
What are you doing?

03:49.641 --> 03:52.521
Mashka here, darling. Call me.

03:52.721 --> 03:56.321
This is crazy. I love you! You love me.

03:56.521 --> 03:58.721
That's more important than
what your family think.

04:00.321 --> 04:02.121
10 to 1 it's a domestic.

04:02.321 --> 04:05.361
Don't want to have to take your
money again, Nick, but you're on.

04:05.561 --> 04:08.641
Darling, it's Mashka
again. Where are you?

04:08.841 --> 04:12.081
It's late and your uncle is
complaining. Can you call me?

04:12.281 --> 04:14.321
That came through 20 minutes ago.

04:14.521 --> 04:17.880
Guess you've done your fair
share of death knocks in Goulburn.

04:38.361 --> 04:42.281
Just deliver the news. Try not
to get emotionally involved.

04:42.481 --> 04:44.241
Are you telling yourself that or me?

05:03.481 --> 05:04.961
Shh, shh.

05:05.161 --> 05:07.401
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:10.321 --> 05:13.001
My brother's been killed.

05:13.201 --> 05:14.561
Why?

05:14.761 --> 05:19.321
We don't know yet. Was
there anyone threatening him?

05:19.521 --> 05:20.841
No.

05:21.041 --> 05:24.361
Do you have any idea why
someone would have done this?

05:24.561 --> 05:26.801
Any long-term lovers, or...?

05:27.001 --> 05:29.441
Lovers?

05:30.641 --> 05:34.281
With Haris, it's
always work, work, work.

05:36.721 --> 05:38.961
He doesn't have time for girlfriends.

05:42.721 --> 05:45.801
Um, what about any, um, boyfriends?

05:46.001 --> 05:47.201
What?

05:47.361 --> 05:50.041
No, no, no. You don't understand.

05:50.241 --> 05:54.241
My son is not a homosexual. No!

05:54.441 --> 05:56.081
No.

06:20.001 --> 06:22.721
It... was Haris wearing a watch?

06:22.921 --> 06:24.361
No.

06:24.561 --> 06:27.841
Our father's watch is
missing. It's a Piaget.

06:32.201 --> 06:34.201
His black leather
jacket isn't here either.

06:34.401 --> 06:36.561
He loved it. He would
never let me borrow it.

06:38.161 --> 06:43.681
Could you tell me, who is this
with Haris in this photograph?

06:43.881 --> 06:45.761
His name is Rohan.

06:45.961 --> 06:47.441
Mm.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.041
Is he a boyfriend?

06:49.241 --> 06:50.681
Ex.

06:50.881 --> 06:53.041
Do you recognise this voice?

06:53.241 --> 06:56.641
This is crazy. I love you, you love me.

06:56.841 --> 06:58.881
That's more important than
what your family think.

07:01.441 --> 07:03.001
Would Rohan have a key?

07:06.961 --> 07:08.561
Do you know his address?

07:10.041 --> 07:11.401
It should be in Haris's phone.

07:11.601 --> 07:13.161
Yeah, we haven't found his phone yet.

07:13.361 --> 07:16.161
If that freaky Persian
killed my brother...

07:16.361 --> 07:17.721
Nick.

07:17.961 --> 07:21.321
Excuse me. Still no phone, but thought
you might want to take a look at that.

07:21.521 --> 07:23.561
- Thanks.
- I want that back downstairs.

07:27.441 --> 07:32.601
Thrustr? Did your brother
use Thrustr to meet men?

07:32.801 --> 07:34.801
We didn't talk about his sex life much.

07:35.001 --> 07:38.081
But he did meet random men for sex?

07:38.281 --> 07:39.841
He might have.

07:42.321 --> 07:44.161
Well, come on, mate.
I'll drive you home.

07:50.841 --> 07:52.241
Uh...

07:52.441 --> 07:55.841
Try canvassing the neighbours,
see if anybody heard anything.

07:56.041 --> 07:57.601
And don't try so hard.

08:22.281 --> 08:26.001
Did you see or hear anything
unusual last night, Mr...?

08:26.201 --> 08:29.001
Mac. Eddie Mac.

08:29.201 --> 08:30.921
I didn't see nothing.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.961
Heard banging on me ceiling.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.081
I thought it was horseplay.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.841
Two stallions kind of horseplay.

08:46.801 --> 08:49.081
I had to yell at them to
stop the friggin' noise.

08:49.281 --> 08:50.721
What time was that?

08:52.721 --> 08:54.241
About midnight.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.601
Did you get up to deal with it?

09:00.921 --> 09:03.521
He was beaten. He
didn't call out for help?

09:03.721 --> 09:06.841
Well, if he did, I
didn't hear any squealing.

09:10.481 --> 09:12.161
Have you ever been inside?

09:13.281 --> 09:15.401
- Haris's?
- Nuh.

09:17.681 --> 09:21.601
And... do you have a
prison record, Mr Mac?

09:22.641 --> 09:23.881
Hell no.

09:27.881 --> 09:29.081
Right.

09:39.081 --> 09:40.561
Oi!

09:40.761 --> 09:42.681
- Hey.
- Got some questions for you.

09:42.881 --> 09:46.721
- About?
- Do you know about this Thrustr app?

09:47.761 --> 09:49.841
- You want to know about Thrustr?
- Yeah.

09:50.041 --> 09:51.481
And you think I know?

09:55.481 --> 09:59.441
Users upload a picture,
a short description,

09:59.641 --> 10:01.841
the kind of guy you're looking for.

10:02.041 --> 10:05.281
The GPS on your phone shows
the location of a user.

10:07.121 --> 10:09.161
Users can send messages to one another

10:09.361 --> 10:10.961
and they don't show on phone records.

10:13.121 --> 10:15.321
You don't look impressed.

10:15.521 --> 10:19.281
Well, it's the perfect tool for
our killer to lure his victim.

10:22.361 --> 10:24.521
Hey, are there any
70-year-old boxers on there?

10:24.721 --> 10:28.441
Honey, you'd be surprised who's on here.

10:28.641 --> 10:30.481
Is that right?

10:33.681 --> 10:36.161
- This is nice.
- Mm. Will be.

10:47.721 --> 10:51.721
Eddie Mac was sentenced to
six months in 1983 for assault.

10:51.921 --> 10:55.041
He worked at a local club, he
was a bouncer, hit a client.

10:55.241 --> 10:56.721
You got anything more recent?

10:56.921 --> 10:58.161
Uh, yes.

10:58.361 --> 11:00.121
He had a fight with our victim

11:00.321 --> 11:03.201
over what he refers to
as "his parking spot".

11:03.401 --> 11:04.681
What about the family?

11:04.881 --> 11:07.601
They seem like a close unit,
genuinely shocked to hear the news.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.841
His brother was the only one
who knew about his sexuality.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.441
- The twin did not like the ex.
- Yeah.

11:13.641 --> 11:16.081
According to the brother,
the ex was the needy type

11:16.281 --> 11:17.761
and his needs weren't being met.

11:17.961 --> 11:20.401
Now, if I didn't know
about the ex-boyfriend,

11:20.601 --> 11:22.321
I might wonder if theft was a motive,

11:22.521 --> 11:25.761
so do we have any violent
burglaries in the area?

11:25.961 --> 11:28.041
- Not like this.
- Hmm.

11:28.241 --> 11:31.241
Could it be that we're
dealing with a hate crime?

11:31.441 --> 11:36.201
The victim's gay, the neighbour
downstairs has a history with assault

11:36.401 --> 11:37.681
and a homophobic attitude.

11:37.881 --> 11:40.361
So, you think the neighbour
might be a good fit for it?

11:40.601 --> 11:44.641
The ligature marks indicate to me that
the killer is into control and domination.

11:44.841 --> 11:47.361
The cuts to the testes indicate anger.

11:47.561 --> 11:49.801
My intuition is that we're
dealing with somebody...

11:50.001 --> 11:51.801
Hang on, intuition?

11:52.001 --> 11:54.241
We need evidence. MMO.

11:54.441 --> 11:55.921
Motive, means, opportunity.

11:56.121 --> 11:57.401
Motive we're not too sure about.

11:57.601 --> 12:00.121
Means, we know that he was beaten
to death by a right-handed man

12:00.161 --> 12:01.801
with a blunt instrument
we don't have yet.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.481
And opportunity...

12:03.681 --> 12:08.081
well, victim's gay, used
Thrustr and he had a jealous ex.

12:08.281 --> 12:13.041
This is the ex. Surname
and address unknown as yet.

12:13.241 --> 12:15.601
Well, we might get a
break with the CCTV.

12:15.801 --> 12:18.481
The victim's flat is here. It's
right next to Cardinal Park.

12:18.681 --> 12:21.041
There's a good escape
route to the ocean path.

12:21.170 --> 12:23.881
It's lit in parts. I'm
not sure about CCTV.

12:24.081 --> 12:25.921
Well, find out.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.201
Right, well, I'll get the
uniforms knocking on doors.

12:28.321 --> 12:30.321
The rest of you, get out
there, find me the weapon.

13:51.321 --> 13:53.289
What are you doing here?

13:53.841 --> 13:55.441
Waiting for you.

13:55.641 --> 13:58.641
- Oh, pff.
- In our new happy home.

14:00.161 --> 14:02.321
And I got school tomorrow.

14:02.521 --> 14:05.081
Your granddad is supposed
to be looking after you.

14:05.281 --> 14:07.161
I decided to walk.

14:07.361 --> 14:10.401
Will. You shouldn't be alone.

14:10.601 --> 14:12.481
I can take care of myself.

14:12.681 --> 14:14.441
Oh, can you?

14:16.601 --> 14:20.761
Been searching the news. No homicides.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.961
What happened?

14:23.161 --> 14:26.201
A young man was killed while
he was home alone in a flat.

14:28.641 --> 14:32.121
I can go back to
Goulburn, live with Dad.

14:32.321 --> 14:33.921
No.

14:34.121 --> 14:37.361
No. You're staying here with me

14:37.561 --> 14:40.361
'cause I'm greedy and I
want you all to myself.

14:41.561 --> 14:43.441
And I want to know that you're safe.

15:12.601 --> 15:14.001
Give it here!

15:36.361 --> 15:39.521
Come on. No way. It's mine.

15:40.961 --> 15:41.761
No.

15:41.961 --> 15:42.961
Hey!

15:43.121 --> 15:46.401
Did you boys bring that with you?

15:46.601 --> 15:48.081
The club?

15:49.386 --> 15:51.281
- Nah, we found it.
- Where?

15:53.001 --> 15:55.801
Ok, I need you to show me
exactly where you found it.

16:00.841 --> 16:03.081
Just found it over here.

16:03.218 --> 16:06.241
- Right. Do you have a phone?
- Yeah.

16:07.187 --> 16:09.681
The club was found in Saltwater,

16:09.881 --> 16:12.921
been through five tidal changes
and lodged beneath a rock

16:13.121 --> 16:17.321
and in the hands of two kids, but
it did test positive for blood.

16:17.521 --> 16:19.321
It will take some time to get a match,

16:19.521 --> 16:22.241
but we also retrieved tissue and fibre.

16:26.961 --> 16:30.721
Eddie Mac watched me recover
the weapon from the rocks.

16:30.921 --> 16:33.241
He's got a record. Can we
see if his prints match?

16:33.441 --> 16:35.521
I doubt we'll get prints off the weapon.

16:35.721 --> 16:37.561
However, we did get
prints from the apartment.

16:37.761 --> 16:40.801
None so far have come up as
criminal, but we'll keep trying.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.681
Fragments of hair found
on the victim's torso

16:43.881 --> 16:45.521
about 1/16 millimetre long.

16:45.721 --> 16:46.921
Shavings.

16:46.961 --> 16:52.001
Bingo. Also, fur fibre. They
don't know yet what animal.

16:52.201 --> 16:54.561
Good news is they found similar fibre

16:54.761 --> 16:56.441
wedged into the grain of the club.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.001
Forensics also found
semen on the sheets,

16:59.201 --> 17:02.561
fragments of crystal meth on the
body, but none in Haris's blood.

17:02.761 --> 17:08.040
So, angry, iced-up, sleep-deprived
boxer, or jealous lover?

17:08.241 --> 17:10.800
- I'm going to go with jealous lover.
- Could be a jealous lover.

17:10.840 --> 17:14.281
Could be the victim was into
consensual BDSM role-play

17:14.481 --> 17:16.281
and it just went really wrong.

17:16.481 --> 17:17.800
Worst case scenario,

17:18.001 --> 17:20.441
we're dealing with a
psychologically disturbed killer,

17:20.641 --> 17:22.883
- and an organised one.
- It may not be his first.

17:22.922 --> 17:26.080
So look into it, see if you can
find any murders with a similar MO.

17:41.481 --> 17:46.481
We need a room so that Ismail
and Amir can wash Haris.

17:48.001 --> 17:51.241
I'm afraid that's not possible. They
haven't done the post-mortem yet.

17:53.121 --> 17:57.601
Haris needs to be
clean to enter paradise.

17:59.281 --> 18:01.641
You'll have to wait
until the body's released.

18:06.641 --> 18:08.081
He is ours.

18:09.641 --> 18:11.081
Not yours.

18:13.441 --> 18:17.921
God have mercy you never
find yourself in my place.

18:20.681 --> 18:24.281
Now, can I just be alone with
my son for a moment, please?

18:24.481 --> 18:25.761
Of course.

18:39.241 --> 18:41.001
Have you found him yet?

18:41.201 --> 18:44.401
No. A surname would help.

18:44.601 --> 18:47.601
When he met Haris, he was
attached to a university.

18:47.801 --> 18:50.161
Ok. Do you remember which one?

18:51.721 --> 18:54.361
I don't, but he was a scientist.

18:56.161 --> 18:57.521
That's helpful. Thank you.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.121
His hands!

18:59.321 --> 19:00.601
He...

19:00.801 --> 19:03.041
He was... he was tied!

19:03.241 --> 19:04.961
Why's his hands...?

19:05.161 --> 19:08.601
- Cover him, please.
- He's tied! Please, no.

19:08.801 --> 19:13.921
Please! Can I just have
peace? Peace for my son!

20:45.161 --> 20:47.881
Sir, there was a prior
murder at Cardinal Park.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.681
Facts, Victoria. Start with when.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.281
- January 1990.
- Oh, that's too far back.

20:52.481 --> 20:54.681
Well, it was right outside Mac's place.

20:54.706 --> 20:56.161
Yeah. Was Mac convicted?

20:56.361 --> 20:59.281
No. No, but that doesn't
mean he wasn't involved.

20:59.326 --> 21:03.601
1990... Canberra beat Penrith. It
was Canberra's second premiership.

21:03.801 --> 21:05.041
That was a good game.

21:05.108 --> 21:07.356
And I was a junior officer
here. So who was the victim?

21:07.361 --> 21:09.201
- Greg Mills.
- Mills! I remember.

21:09.401 --> 21:11.161
Some poor Polish prick got charged.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.486
And frankly, I was a bit
surprised he got done with murder.

21:13.510 --> 21:15.921
- Right. Why was that?
- Well, it was just a stupid fight.

21:16.121 --> 21:17.801
Bit of push, bit of
shove, bit of bad luck.

21:18.892 --> 21:21.121
I read the notes, the
investigation seemed...

21:21.321 --> 21:22.321
Careful.

21:22.481 --> 21:25.601
Well, tied around the statement of
a kid who could barely speak English.

21:25.801 --> 21:27.601
Well, if I remember, the kid confessed.

21:27.801 --> 21:30.721
Now, is there one shred of
evidence tied to the current case?

21:30.961 --> 21:32.515
- No.
- Then stop wasting my time.

21:32.555 --> 21:34.210
I asked for similar MOs.

21:34.241 --> 21:36.522
It's the same location and
the victim profile is the same.

21:36.681 --> 21:37.881
They're both gay men.

21:37.906 --> 21:40.681
26 years apart. Just find
me the rejected lover.

21:40.827 --> 21:46.081
Sir, for a rejected lover, the
killing is brutal. It doesn't gel.

21:49.401 --> 21:51.641
Everyday, Tori,

21:51.841 --> 21:55.121
you come to work prepared to give
up your life to protect others, mm?

21:57.761 --> 22:00.201
But you've got a son.

22:00.401 --> 22:01.881
Why would you do that?

22:02.081 --> 22:03.921
Uh...

22:04.121 --> 22:08.841
Well, I love my job. And
I'm the breadwinner now.

22:10.801 --> 22:12.441
You take care you survive.

22:15.561 --> 22:17.721
Merry Christmas.

22:17.921 --> 22:21.361
Your park ranger came through,
CCTV from the coastal walk.

22:23.721 --> 22:24.921
Cheers.

22:32.681 --> 22:35.441
3:10 in the morning. What the
hell's she doing out at that hour?

22:35.641 --> 22:37.081
Animal has fur.

22:37.281 --> 22:38.601
Beast it is.

22:38.801 --> 22:41.201
But forensics confirmed
it's not dog or cat fur.

22:48.081 --> 22:49.281
Hello.

22:49.361 --> 22:50.841
Is that Rohan?

22:51.600 --> 22:52.795
Thanks.

22:53.146 --> 22:56.161
University just coughed
up a surname, Asad.

22:56.361 --> 22:57.721
Rohan was living at the college,

22:57.921 --> 23:01.081
but left several months ago after
a blow-up with his supervisor.

23:06.121 --> 23:08.921
Nothing like social media
to do our job for us.

23:08.937 --> 23:11.537
Ah. Who said you can't
teach an old dog new tricks?

23:13.017 --> 23:16.417
Lab has semen on the sheets,
so if you bring us a suspect...

23:20.497 --> 23:23.497
Looks like he works
at Bronte Beach Kiosk.

23:44.897 --> 23:47.897
Rohan Asad, stop right there! Stop!

23:50.537 --> 23:53.097
Rohan, stop! Police!

23:53.297 --> 23:54.737
Stop! Police!

23:54.937 --> 23:56.737
What do you want?

23:56.937 --> 23:59.577
Just wanted to talk,
mate. Just want to talk.

23:59.777 --> 24:02.657
- You will send me back!
- No, no, no, no.

24:02.857 --> 24:05.497
We're just going to go down to
Bondi station for questioning.

24:05.697 --> 24:08.017
- Just relax.
- Don't let them do this to me!

24:08.217 --> 24:09.817
- Settle down.
- They will kill me!

24:10.017 --> 24:11.537
Settle down!

24:34.377 --> 24:36.577
Rohan, you and Haris were lovers.

24:38.137 --> 24:40.217
For one year, nothing but love.

24:42.977 --> 24:46.097
When I insist Haris to meet his family,

24:46.297 --> 24:49.257
we fight, and that is the end.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.497
When was the last time you saw him?

24:56.537 --> 24:58.137
The day before he is killed.

24:59.417 --> 25:02.137
We swim, talk love.

25:10.737 --> 25:12.777
After, I am out for a walk.

25:12.977 --> 25:16.817
I see him at the Green Room, dancing.

25:19.217 --> 25:20.857
My heart is stone.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.217
Haris used Thrustr to meet men.

25:25.497 --> 25:26.977
Did that upset you?

25:27.177 --> 25:29.137
He did not love them.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.337
I've been betrayed.

25:32.537 --> 25:34.377
It made me angry.

25:37.257 --> 25:39.657
When you face that unexpectedly,

25:39.857 --> 25:42.017
there's no telling how you'll respond.

25:48.897 --> 25:51.617
Haris says that he's a free man,

25:51.817 --> 25:53.697
and that I should go.

25:55.657 --> 25:57.817
So I leave.

25:58.017 --> 26:03.657
Were you inside or outside Haris's
apartment on the night of 25 January?

26:10.257 --> 26:11.457
No.

26:12.657 --> 26:13.857
Ok.

26:14.017 --> 26:16.017
Well, then, we have a
bit of a problem here.

26:17.297 --> 26:22.417
Because you made a phone call
to Haris's apartment at 11:28 pm.

26:23.617 --> 26:27.657
And we have CCTV footage
of you at 5:10 am.

26:29.097 --> 26:34.497
So I need you to help me understand
what happened in between those hours.

26:36.297 --> 26:39.457
Did you have sex with Haris
the night he was killed?

26:42.777 --> 26:45.457
I... I want everything to end.

26:46.937 --> 26:49.937
So I swim far into black water.

26:50.137 --> 26:52.577
But I am a coward.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.817
I turn back and...

26:55.017 --> 26:58.697
police come, throw me into van.

26:58.897 --> 27:01.377
They take me to hospital
where I am prison.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.337
It was night time.

27:08.537 --> 27:09.897
I go to see Haris.

27:10.097 --> 27:14.737
I want to apologise, so
that we can love again.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.737
I go inside and...

27:24.577 --> 27:26.057
What did you see?

27:27.497 --> 27:28.937
Blood.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.457
I want to hold him.

27:34.657 --> 27:36.457
But...

27:36.657 --> 27:39.297
he is... he is dead.

27:42.137 --> 27:46.977
I go to call police, but I...
I hear a door slam, so I flee.

27:48.537 --> 27:52.217
Outside, I phone emergency
and then I talk to police.

27:57.368 --> 27:58.659
Rohan, we're going to need...

27:58.690 --> 27:59.901
Peel.

27:59.926 --> 28:01.643
Some blood and hair samples from you.

28:01.668 --> 28:03.417
- What?
- Right.

28:03.617 --> 28:05.257
What will you do with my blood?

28:05.457 --> 28:07.869
- Why do you want...
- His student visa ran out months ago.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.337
The Feds are on their way.

28:16.857 --> 28:18.897
Rohan, do you have a current visa?

28:21.897 --> 28:27.737
I have applied for bridging
visa. I... I am immunologist.

28:27.937 --> 28:29.777
When I get visa, I will get job.

28:31.737 --> 28:34.057
Rohan Asad, you are an unlawful citizen

28:34.082 --> 28:36.017
under section 48 of the Migration Act...

28:36.042 --> 28:38.498
As a result, you will be
taken to a detention centre.

28:38.523 --> 28:40.137
No. No. Please. Please!

28:40.162 --> 28:43.817
Please don't let them send me
back! Please. Please. Please, don't!

29:04.417 --> 29:05.777
Uniforms took a man

29:05.977 --> 29:08.897
who gave his name as Rumi to
St Jude's just after midnight.

29:09.097 --> 29:11.612
Well, that's the time of death.
Does that leave him off the hook?

29:11.617 --> 29:12.817
Wriggling.

29:12.857 --> 29:15.377
But Haris's phone records
show that he took a call

29:15.577 --> 29:17.217
right at the time that Rohan said.

29:18.577 --> 29:20.817
You think that's enough
to exonerate him, do you?

29:33.257 --> 29:35.017
They are a very cute couple.

29:38.137 --> 29:39.337
Yeah.

29:39.537 --> 29:41.737
Well, it didn't stop
him looking for company.

29:43.577 --> 29:45.537
Jesus.

29:45.737 --> 29:47.817
The prosecution would
have a field day with this.

29:48.017 --> 29:50.337
- Comes across as a stalker.

29:50.537 --> 29:53.417
Ok. We've got a single
key, possibly to Haris's.

29:53.442 --> 29:55.952
We've got a passport, money... not much.

29:55.977 --> 29:59.417
No leather jacket, no
watch, no wallet, no phone.

29:59.617 --> 30:01.617
No bloodied shoes or garment.

30:07.337 --> 30:08.897
Lithium carbonate.

30:09.097 --> 30:10.577
Maybe he's bipolar.

30:10.777 --> 30:12.497
Well, he'll need his medication.

30:15.017 --> 30:19.097
- Discharge sheet, St Jude's hospital.
- 10.

30:19.297 --> 30:21.177
Maybe he is telling the truth.

30:22.977 --> 30:24.537
Ah.

30:24.737 --> 30:27.257
Alright. We've got some blood here.

30:28.617 --> 30:30.612
- Get on the ground right now.
- This is a crime scene.

30:30.617 --> 30:32.257
- Hey, relax, guys.
- Put the gun down.

30:32.457 --> 30:34.337
- Back out.
- Relax, guys.

30:34.362 --> 30:37.153
- We're Bondi detectives, alright?
- You. Up against the wall.

30:37.217 --> 30:39.977
Oi! You heard my partner. Just
get out of our crime scene.

30:40.177 --> 30:42.457
- Where's your badge?
- Inside pocket.

30:44.057 --> 30:45.497
You happy?

30:45.697 --> 30:47.457
Alright. So, you're Bondi detectives.

30:47.657 --> 30:49.577
This is ours. What are you doing here?

30:49.777 --> 30:52.577
Well, we're searching the
premises of a murder suspect.

30:52.777 --> 30:54.057
What are you doing here?

30:54.257 --> 30:56.617
Rohan Asad. He escaped from custody.

30:56.817 --> 30:58.097
Oh, shit.

30:58.297 --> 31:00.137
Please tell me you had him in handcuffs.

31:00.337 --> 31:02.737
You can't even hang on
to a frightened student

31:02.937 --> 31:05.752
and then you come in here, you
trample all over the evidence.

31:05.777 --> 31:07.057
Why don't you piss off?

31:07.257 --> 31:09.377
Hey. Hey, that's ours, mate.

31:09.577 --> 31:13.497
Yeah, in your dreams, mate. You can
have it when we're done, alright?

31:20.417 --> 31:22.577
You shouldn't have pulled
that on the Feds, Tori.

31:22.777 --> 31:24.697
They don't know the arse end of a gun.

31:24.897 --> 31:26.737
You're bloody lucky you didn't get shot.

31:26.937 --> 31:28.697
Yeah, your attitude didn't really help.

31:28.897 --> 31:30.417
Thanks for the backup, by the way.

31:30.617 --> 31:32.817
Yeah, only cowboys are
quick to draw their gun.

31:33.017 --> 31:35.937
If you can't talk your way into a
good result, you're no detective.

31:36.137 --> 31:37.617
Are you calling me a cowboy?

31:37.817 --> 31:40.457
Well, there were a lot of
cows where you worked last.

31:40.657 --> 31:41.857
Hilarious.

31:42.017 --> 31:44.097
Listen, I don't think Rohan's our man.

31:44.297 --> 31:47.177
The blood stains on his jeans,
it's consistent with his story.

31:47.377 --> 31:49.897
What, that's your famous
intuition again, is it?

31:58.217 --> 32:00.137
You haven't been
straight with us, Eddie.

32:00.337 --> 32:02.137
And for a coach with wannabe champions,

32:02.337 --> 32:04.097
that's a bit of a problem.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.937
What do you want?

32:06.137 --> 32:08.417
You tell us what you heard

32:08.617 --> 32:10.097
and what you saw

32:10.297 --> 32:12.257
and this time, don't leave anything out.

32:12.457 --> 32:14.977
I've got nothing that's gonna help ya.

32:15.177 --> 32:17.617
You've got a good rep as a coach, Eddie.

32:17.817 --> 32:20.897
Be a shame to have to
revoke your licence.

32:21.097 --> 32:23.337
You can't be a coach
if you've been inside.

32:23.537 --> 32:24.977
Oh, come on.

32:25.177 --> 32:28.697
I was a stupid hot-head
back in those days.

32:30.777 --> 32:34.457
I want a guarantee this isn't
going to cost me my licence.

32:34.657 --> 32:36.817
Well, I can't give you that
until I know what you have.

32:39.657 --> 32:41.897
It was a bad night. Hot.

32:42.097 --> 32:43.897
They was fighting upstairs.

32:44.097 --> 32:47.777
I just get to sleep and I could
hear this yelling and moaning.

32:47.977 --> 32:51.297
I went out to tell the inconsiderate
prick to shut the fuck up.

32:51.497 --> 32:53.057
I couldn't see anyone.

32:54.217 --> 32:56.817
Coming back inside, I found this.

32:59.857 --> 33:04.017
When I found out about the murder,
I thought it looked bad so I shut up.

33:07.457 --> 33:08.737
Did you see who dropped it?

33:08.937 --> 33:10.937
I told you, I didn't see nothing.

33:11.137 --> 33:13.937
Yeah, you keep it. It's
been burning away in here.

33:14.137 --> 33:16.177
Were you here in 1990?

33:16.377 --> 33:19.337
Yeah. I've always been
here. I've never moved.

33:19.537 --> 33:22.777
Are you aware there was a
murder out there on the rocks?

33:23.977 --> 33:25.577
He got what he deserved.

33:26.937 --> 33:29.377
Some local kids got the jack
of it and took the faggots on.

33:29.577 --> 33:31.457
I can't say I blame them.

33:31.657 --> 33:34.137
Do you know what happened to those kids,

33:34.337 --> 33:35.857
where they are now?

33:36.057 --> 33:37.617
No. It was a long time ago.

33:37.817 --> 33:40.537
They're probably all grown
up, moved away. I don't know.

33:45.377 --> 33:47.657
Mum always used to
give us the same gifts.

33:53.857 --> 33:57.137
We found a receipt in there for
two drinks from the Green Room

33:57.337 --> 33:59.097
the night your brother was killed.

33:59.297 --> 34:00.937
Haris doesn't drink alcohol.

34:01.137 --> 34:03.497
Well, his would be the lime soda, then.

34:03.697 --> 34:05.937
Any idea who drinks Helles Lager?

34:06.137 --> 34:07.977
No.

34:08.177 --> 34:09.496
You caught the Persian prick yet?

34:09.697 --> 34:11.337
We've spoken to him.

34:12.817 --> 34:14.417
My uncle wants to kill him.

34:15.777 --> 34:18.456
Yeah, well, tell your uncle
that's a very bad idea.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.137
Just be patient and we'll
get whoever did this, ok?

34:21.337 --> 34:23.257
What do you mean, "We'll get him"?

34:23.456 --> 34:24.897
I thought you already had him.

34:26.777 --> 34:29.056
You had him and you let him go?!

34:29.257 --> 34:30.976
He's just a suspect for now.

34:42.897 --> 34:46.297
Punter comes in, orders an unusual
drink. You tend to remember that.

34:46.496 --> 34:49.016
Monday night. 9pm.

34:49.217 --> 34:51.817
Lime soda, Helles Lager. Ring any bells?

34:55.577 --> 34:59.257
Lime soda was hot. He flirted,
so I knew he was interested.

34:59.457 --> 35:01.977
- Then Helles Lager turns up.
- Can you describe him?

35:02.177 --> 35:04.097
Helles Lager?

35:04.297 --> 35:07.937
Pumped. Dark hair. Nervous.

35:09.137 --> 35:10.537
They weren't close.

35:10.737 --> 35:13.857
Which made me happy, 'cause
I quite fancied lime soda.

35:14.057 --> 35:15.537
He's dead.

35:15.737 --> 35:17.417
That's a shame. He was cute.

35:17.617 --> 35:20.537
What about this man? Have you seen him?

35:20.737 --> 35:22.892
Yeah, I've seen him. Not for me.

35:22.937 --> 35:25.537
Liam. Fuck off. You too.

35:25.737 --> 35:27.322
Mr Hampton,

35:27.377 --> 35:30.857
we'd like to have a look at your
CCTV footage for Monday night.

35:31.057 --> 35:33.217
Would you? You got a warrant?

35:33.417 --> 35:36.057
It would be in your
interest to help us out.

35:37.417 --> 35:40.457
Don't tell me what my interest is

35:40.657 --> 35:43.537
unless it's hot sex and you're willing.

35:43.737 --> 35:45.657
Oh, righto. Righto!

35:45.857 --> 35:48.577
Don't fucking touch me.

35:52.497 --> 35:55.977
- Was that entirely necessary, Tori?
- Yes. It was.

35:56.177 --> 36:00.657
Yeah, well, you just blew any chance
we had of getting the CCTV footage.

36:00.857 --> 36:04.497
By the time we get a warrant, any
CCTV footage he has will be wiped,

36:04.697 --> 36:06.897
if he has any, which I doubt.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.017
Rohan Asad has a prison record in Iran.

36:54.217 --> 36:56.777
He was arrested January 2003 for sodomy.

36:56.977 --> 36:59.257
He was imprisoned for two
years, transferred to hospital,

36:59.457 --> 37:00.737
released on bail somehow.

37:00.937 --> 37:03.737
Old Rohan escapes and
he finds his way here.

37:03.937 --> 37:05.337
After all he's been through,

37:05.537 --> 37:07.777
it doesn't make sense
that he'd kill someone

37:07.977 --> 37:11.457
and risk being sent back
to that kind of persecution.

37:11.657 --> 37:13.097
Yeah, but if it's a crime of passion

37:13.257 --> 37:15.137
then he wasn't thinking at all.

37:15.337 --> 37:18.017
Sir, the bloodstains on Rohan's jeans,

37:18.217 --> 37:20.297
they are consistent
with him kneeling down.

37:20.497 --> 37:22.017
There is no other blood splatter.

37:22.217 --> 37:24.337
He has a strong alibi
for the time of death.

37:24.537 --> 37:27.257
I know you don't think Rohan had
anything to do with this, Lustigman,

37:27.297 --> 37:29.017
but everything points to it.

37:32.777 --> 37:37.217
ok, sir, but this past murder
at Cardinal Park, it bothers me.

37:37.417 --> 37:39.857
I can't find any trace of
the man who went down for it.

37:40.057 --> 37:41.977
- Adamski?
- Yeah.

37:42.177 --> 37:45.177
What if there's a link
with him and Eddie Mac?

37:45.377 --> 37:49.777
I'd like to follow up with the
investigating officer, um, Chalmers.

37:49.977 --> 37:51.257
Chalmers.

37:51.457 --> 37:55.137
You'll get nothing from him.
He left the job under a cloud.

37:59.377 --> 38:02.817
Is it odd that Adamski's
just disappeared?

38:05.537 --> 38:08.817
Hey, no, no. Tori. Tori, Tori. Don't.

38:09.017 --> 38:10.697
You're just going to antagonise him.

38:27.457 --> 38:30.817
It's been a while since someone
on the job came asking for help.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.177
Since the Royal Commission.

38:36.777 --> 38:40.737
You nailed Adamski for the
murder of Greg Mills back in 1990.

38:42.457 --> 38:45.417
We got lucky. Someone had a conscience.

38:47.697 --> 38:49.857
Do you have any idea
where Adamski is now?

38:50.057 --> 38:51.497
Feeding the daisies.

38:53.257 --> 38:54.977
I had a deal with his silk.

38:55.177 --> 38:56.897
He had information about other deaths,

38:57.097 --> 38:58.657
but I didn't get to close the books

38:58.857 --> 39:01.457
before they found him
hanging off a shower.

39:01.657 --> 39:04.777
Now, I can't find any records
of him deceased or alive.

39:04.977 --> 39:07.737
He had a sex change while he was inside.

39:07.937 --> 39:10.097
- What?
- Yeah, he got the chop.

39:11.657 --> 39:14.697
Yeah. If you go looking, you'll
find him under a different name.

39:14.897 --> 39:16.337
Oh.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.537
There was an under-age
who went down with him.

39:20.737 --> 39:22.537
A Brett O'Donohue.

39:22.737 --> 39:24.417
They were the two I nailed.

39:26.417 --> 39:31.817
But the thugs who I believe were
responsible said they weren't there.

39:33.297 --> 39:35.977
Well, sometimes you get what
you can and call it a good day.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.577
- How old were you in '89?
- Oh, primary school.

39:42.777 --> 39:44.817
Poofter-bashing was a sport back then.

39:45.017 --> 39:47.257
A blood sport.

39:47.457 --> 39:50.137
Gangs of youths up and down the coast.

39:52.177 --> 39:53.777
Hunting for prey.

39:57.257 --> 40:00.057
But don't make the mistake of thinking
all these lads were underclass.

40:00.257 --> 40:02.577
Some of them were from decent families.

40:04.417 --> 40:06.697
There was a gay beat at Cardinal Park

40:06.897 --> 40:09.257
and one of these gangs, the Pointers...

40:10.377 --> 40:12.777
Shark Point, white pointers, who knows?

40:13.937 --> 40:15.897
Took to the sport with a vengeance.

40:18.017 --> 40:23.497
Led by a vicious kid called
Kyle Hampton, aka Hammers.

40:23.697 --> 40:25.952
You're kidding. He runs the Green Room.

40:25.977 --> 40:28.017
That's where our victim
had his last drink.

40:28.217 --> 40:30.337
Yeah. Hammers was a charismatic prick.

40:30.537 --> 40:33.297
He should have been
locked away 25 years ago.

40:33.497 --> 40:35.657
He thinks he's invincible.

40:44.035 --> 40:47.137
My God. There's so many. Nearly 70.

40:47.337 --> 40:51.977
Disappearances, assaults, suicides.

40:52.177 --> 40:53.817
After a while, you see the pattern.

40:54.017 --> 40:56.257
Why weren't these acted on?

40:56.457 --> 40:57.977
Well, you tell me.

40:58.177 --> 41:02.657
These men were assaulted and
killed and no-one was ever charged?

41:02.857 --> 41:04.417
That's right.

41:09.657 --> 41:11.737
Are you saying there was a cover-up?

41:11.937 --> 41:13.497
I don't know.

41:13.697 --> 41:16.457
There was a climate of
fear around AIDS back then.

41:16.657 --> 41:18.857
The Grim Reaper ads
had everyone terrified.

41:22.177 --> 41:25.097
Shouldn't this be in archives?

41:25.297 --> 41:28.737
Back then, it was a weapon
used in a suspected assault,

41:28.937 --> 41:31.577
so it didn't end up in
the evidence lock-up.

41:31.777 --> 41:34.497
I had my suspicions, so I hung onto it.

41:37.497 --> 41:40.657
These leather bindings, they're
on the club that we found.

41:40.857 --> 41:42.697
Where did you get this?

41:42.897 --> 41:47.017
Hammers and his future footy star
mate Toohey, drunk on Bondi Beach.

41:47.217 --> 41:49.257
Toohey, the Friday game show guy?

41:49.457 --> 41:50.657
Who else?

41:52.817 --> 41:54.577
Is this blood?

41:54.777 --> 41:56.297
It is.

41:56.497 --> 42:00.257
No victim came forward,
but then they often didn't.

42:00.457 --> 42:02.617
That's why that never made it to court.

42:04.017 --> 42:06.777
December 24, 1989.

42:29.617 --> 42:31.417
How's Will?

42:31.617 --> 42:33.737
Once I wrestled the
console from him, fine.

42:33.937 --> 42:35.577
Sleeping like a baby.

42:40.577 --> 42:43.057
Hey, do you remember the Grim Reaper ad?

42:53.617 --> 42:56.977
At first, only gays and IV drug users

42:57.177 --> 42:58.697
were being killed by AIDS.

42:58.897 --> 43:03.177
But now we know every one of
us could be devastated by it.

43:06.097 --> 43:11.297
If not stopped, it could kill
more Australians than World War II.

43:15.977 --> 43:17.817
How old were you in 1989?

43:19.137 --> 43:21.057
- 19.
- Yeah.

43:21.257 --> 43:22.897
And out.

43:24.297 --> 43:27.857
You know my dad sent me to a
shrink to try and fix the problem?

43:29.737 --> 43:32.537
Hey, here I am gay and a
happier man than he ever was.

43:32.737 --> 43:34.417
Cheers to that.

43:39.377 --> 43:42.897
So you were 19, out, in Bondi.

43:43.097 --> 43:44.297
Yeah.

43:44.497 --> 43:47.297
- Were you ever attacked?
- By whom?

43:48.497 --> 43:50.537
Gang.

43:50.737 --> 43:53.017
Maybe the police.

43:54.657 --> 43:56.337
You want to see how it was?

44:02.097 --> 44:03.657
Mardi Gras.

44:03.857 --> 44:06.097
The first one. 1978.

44:06.297 --> 44:08.177
Unfortunate these sort of things happen.

44:08.377 --> 44:10.417
I think it's unfortunate
that a couple of policemen

44:10.617 --> 44:12.257
had to receive hospital attention.

44:12.457 --> 44:14.737
10 years later, it was better.

44:15.857 --> 44:17.377
But we were still fighting.

44:20.257 --> 44:23.577
Hey... is that Shane?

44:25.537 --> 44:26.977
Mm-hm.

44:32.417 --> 44:34.537
My God. He's so young.

44:45.177 --> 44:46.937
What happened to him?

44:47.977 --> 44:49.217
He drowned.

44:50.577 --> 44:53.337
We searched Christmas Day, Boxing Day.

44:53.537 --> 44:55.537
And then a lifesaver found him.

45:01.137 --> 45:03.017
Were there any signs of violence?

45:04.097 --> 45:05.377
You know what happens to a body

45:05.577 --> 45:07.617
that's been in the water for two days.

45:10.097 --> 45:14.097
Your father just... protected
you from those details.

45:17.897 --> 45:20.097
But what... what did
the coroner's report say?

45:22.137 --> 45:23.937
You'd have to ask Don.

45:40.817 --> 45:42.697
It's always the good swimmers who drown.

45:44.337 --> 45:46.617
But there was an investigation.

45:46.817 --> 45:49.257
Yeah, of course there was
a bloody investigation.

45:49.457 --> 45:51.537
He went swimming, he drowned.

45:53.297 --> 45:55.017
Where did he go in?

45:55.217 --> 45:56.857
Why does matter where he went in?

45:59.417 --> 46:03.697
Did anyone mention Cardinal
Park or Shark Point?

46:08.537 --> 46:10.217
Shane was a happy boy.

46:10.417 --> 46:12.097
Got caught in a bastard rip.

46:12.297 --> 46:13.937
The ocean took him.

46:19.337 --> 46:22.377
This is a recorded
interview for police records.

46:22.577 --> 46:24.697
Can you state your name for the camera?

46:24.897 --> 46:28.057
Yeah. Brett Roger Ian O'Donohue.

46:28.257 --> 46:29.897
Martin Adamski.

46:30.097 --> 46:32.657
We saw the guy walking
down. Spoke to him.

46:32.857 --> 46:35.977
Told him I'd give him a
blowie, so he came with me.

46:37.297 --> 46:39.817
The poof got his pants
down around his ankles.

46:40.017 --> 46:42.897
He was heaps stiff
and he grabbed my cock

46:43.097 --> 46:45.657
and Adamski came from behind
him and smacked over the head.

46:45.857 --> 46:47.217
What with?

46:47.417 --> 46:48.697
A lead pipe.

46:48.897 --> 46:50.897
How many times did you hit Mr Mills?

46:51.097 --> 46:54.417
Nah, I told you before.
Adamski laid into him.

46:54.617 --> 46:56.257
Show me how many times you hit him.

46:59.217 --> 47:01.217
Bit of a push, bit of a shove.

47:01.417 --> 47:03.497
What were you doing, Brett,
while this was happening?

47:03.577 --> 47:06.177
Pulled my pants up and I
started kicking him in the face.

47:08.497 --> 47:12.937
He stood up and started backing away
from us, straight over the cliff.

47:14.747 --> 47:17.297
I'm 14. He grabbed my cock.

47:17.497 --> 47:19.497
He's in the wrong, right?

47:20.777 --> 47:23.177
So, a lead pipe with leather bindings.

47:23.377 --> 47:24.577
Similar weapon

47:24.777 --> 47:27.657
found in the same location that we
found the club that killed Haris.

47:27.857 --> 47:31.057
So we've got Cardinal Park,
Shark Point, three bodies

47:31.257 --> 47:34.097
here, here and here.

47:34.297 --> 47:36.857
We've got Greg Mills,
found on the rocks,

47:37.057 --> 47:39.937
killed by Adamski and O'Donohue.

47:40.137 --> 47:43.337
There's Dr Peter Levy, was
also found on the rocks.

47:43.537 --> 47:48.057
Reported as suicide, but forensics
have him with defensive wounds

47:48.257 --> 47:50.057
and under his nails, skin.

47:50.257 --> 47:51.657
Pre-DNA.

47:51.857 --> 47:54.817
Yeah, well, that'd be
useful if we ever find it.

47:55.017 --> 47:56.457
Yeah. Wouldn't hold your breath.

47:56.657 --> 47:58.617
Then you have Ned Davies.

47:58.817 --> 48:04.657
He went for a walk in Cardinal
Park, disappeared December 17, 1989.

48:04.857 --> 48:06.697
We do not have a body for him.

48:07.777 --> 48:09.577
Nick, the numbers are growing.

48:11.097 --> 48:13.617
We've got one murder 26 years later.

48:13.817 --> 48:17.137
Well, O'Donohue was released
from Silverwater a year ago.

48:17.337 --> 48:19.617
Well, let's find out where he is now.

48:19.817 --> 48:22.632
Rohan Asad's blood sample
is a DNA match for the semen

48:22.657 --> 48:24.257
found on the victim.

48:57.977 --> 49:00.617
Slow down. It's not a bloody race.

49:11.657 --> 49:13.297
Rohan.

49:14.377 --> 49:15.977
Are you there?

49:18.137 --> 49:21.577
Rohan, listen, I have your
medication and I think you need it,

49:21.777 --> 49:23.377
so why don't you tell me where you are

49:23.577 --> 49:25.537
and I can come and pick you up, ok?

49:30.177 --> 49:35.017
Rohan, I read your case file and
I know what you suffered in Iran.

49:37.977 --> 49:39.537
99 lashes.

49:40.897 --> 49:42.817
Imprisonment.

49:43.017 --> 49:45.657
My own father betrayed me.

49:45.857 --> 49:49.457
I understand why you
might fear the police.

49:49.657 --> 49:53.817
But... I'm going to
ask you to trust me, ok?

49:54.017 --> 49:55.777
Yeah, just tell her to keep talking.

49:55.977 --> 49:57.857
Can you guys go any fuckin' faster?

50:01.257 --> 50:05.777
Everything that you tell us, it
helps us put the picture together.

50:06.857 --> 50:09.937
Rohan, did you have sex with
Haris the night he was killed?

50:11.257 --> 50:12.857
We swim in the day.

50:15.137 --> 50:17.977
I go with him. Play music.

50:19.697 --> 50:20.937
Have sex.

50:22.137 --> 50:25.017
But after, he say never.

50:25.217 --> 50:28.257
He will never tell his
family that he is homosexual.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.217
What kind of life is this?

50:32.697 --> 50:34.297
A life of secrets.

50:36.097 --> 50:39.617
That's good, Rohan. Thank you
for telling me those details.

50:39.817 --> 50:42.098
But I'm going to need you to
come into the police station.

50:42.137 --> 50:44.097
So you can lock me up?

50:44.297 --> 50:46.697
Shave my head, torture me?

50:46.897 --> 50:49.417
Rohan, where are you exactly?

50:49.617 --> 50:52.937
I want your word. You
will let me walk free.

50:55.337 --> 51:00.417
Rohan, can we at least
talk face-to-face?

51:04.897 --> 51:08.977
I... I can see police on the beach.

51:11.337 --> 51:13.257
Ok.

51:13.457 --> 51:17.537
Rohan, listen. I need you to
come out with your hands up

51:17.737 --> 51:22.297
and I can promise you that
no-one's going to hurt you, ok?

51:56.057 --> 51:57.337
Nick!

51:57.537 --> 52:01.057
Nick, he's left-handed. Left-handed.

52:01.257 --> 52:02.457
Rohan!

52:02.657 --> 52:04.937
Put that knife down now! Rohan!

52:05.137 --> 52:06.497
Drop that knife!

52:06.697 --> 52:08.937
Rohan, it's Tori. Drop
the fucking knife now.

52:09.113 --> 52:10.817
- You're ok.
- I did not hurt Haris.

52:11.017 --> 52:12.257
I know. Back away, Tori.

52:12.457 --> 52:14.617
I know you didn't. Don't spook him!

52:14.817 --> 52:16.577
We just want to talk to you, ok?

52:16.777 --> 52:19.697
But I'm going to need you to
put the knife down, alright?

52:19.897 --> 52:22.057
Put the fucking knife down now!

52:22.257 --> 52:23.457
You're ok. Look at me.

52:23.617 --> 52:25.777
Look at me. It's alright.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.337
Fuck.

52:27.537 --> 52:30.457
You put the knife down now,
Rohan, and you let her go!

52:30.657 --> 52:32.697
It's alright. It's alright.

52:32.897 --> 52:35.817
Rohan, I know that you
don't want to hurt me.

52:36.017 --> 52:37.577
Let her go, Rohan.

52:37.777 --> 52:40.697
You talk to me and I
can protect you, ok?

52:40.897 --> 52:42.657
I can keep you safe.

52:43.817 --> 52:47.537
I know this man. He needs medication.

52:47.737 --> 52:49.057
Hold your fire. Hold...

52:49.257 --> 52:51.417
I will not... I will not
go back to hell. I won't!

52:51.617 --> 52:52.617
Listen to me, ok?

52:52.777 --> 52:55.137
Now, we can have a
conversation, can't we?

52:55.337 --> 52:58.617
Yeah? And I can keep you safe. Yeah?

52:58.817 --> 53:00.897
I can protect you. That's right.

53:01.097 --> 53:02.497
You're doing a really good job now.

53:02.697 --> 53:05.577
I'm going to slowly, slowly turn around.

53:05.777 --> 53:07.617
Yeah? You're ok. You're ok.

53:07.817 --> 53:09.697
You look at me. It's alright.

53:09.897 --> 53:12.977
Eyes to me, Rohan. You're ok. You're ok.

53:13.177 --> 53:14.857
We're going to keep you safe.

53:15.057 --> 53:18.817
But to do that, I need to get
the knife out of your hand,

53:19.019 --> 53:20.897
Ok?

53:21.097 --> 53:22.897
I'm going to take the knife...

53:23.097 --> 53:25.057
out of your hand,

53:25.257 --> 53:26.817
Argh!

54:36.657 --> 54:39.057
Critical Incident team are gonna
want to take your statement.

54:39.217 --> 54:41.553
- But I'm not gonna lie.
- You two got your stories straight?

54:41.577 --> 54:43.372
Cardinal Park was pretty
dangerous those days.

54:43.377 --> 54:46.007
Secrets you know give
answers to grieving families.

54:46.057 --> 54:48.210
The Chris Toohey? I've
known him since he was a kid.

54:48.257 --> 54:49.892
He's no killer, except
on the footy field.

54:49.897 --> 54:52.817
But he's hiding something.
Who did you see killed?
