[crowd cheering]

00:06.882 --> 00:10.885
[â™ª The Military Band of the Queen's
Regiment: "Soldiers of the Queen"]

00:18.477 --> 00:21.687
[cheering, fanfare continuing]

00:32.698 --> 00:35.368
[cheering grows louder]

00:52.719 --> 00:54.720
[cheering, fanfare fade]

01:12.614 --> 01:16.617
- [Indian music playing]
- [cash register beeping]

01:21.873 --> 01:24.875
Yeah, mate, I said 30, you can't
expect to get away with it like that.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.669
Make a better deal or it's off.

01:26.837 --> 01:30.840
OK? Well, I'll see you tomorrow then,
ten o'clock, my place.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.181
[man] One forty-nine, please.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.770
- How much is the milk?
- Forty-nine pence.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.736
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.909
One pound, please. Thank you.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.078
[traffic humming]

02:34.237 --> 02:37.573
Uh-uh. Too much.
Much too much butter.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.158
I like butter.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.951
Denis.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.163
Mmm.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.211
- Milk's gone up.
- Hm?

02:50.379 --> 02:54.006
- 49p a pint.
- Good grief!

02:54.174 --> 02:55.800
We'll have to economize.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.552
I suppose we could always sell the car.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.723
- [laughs] Or take in paying guests.
- [coughs]

03:02.891 --> 03:04.767
- [footsteps approach]
- [muffled woman's voice]

03:04.935 --> 03:06.977
Watch out. She's on the prowl.

03:07.145 --> 03:12.066
[voices murmuring]

03:14.653 --> 03:15.903
Eat your egg.

03:20.033 --> 03:25.204
- Goodness! There you are.
- Yes. Here we are.

03:35.716 --> 03:39.343
[woman whispering] How did this happen?
How could she possibly have got out?

03:39.511 --> 03:42.972
It's very, very important
that the front door is left locked.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.890
- Of course.
- Please, make it clear

03:45.058 --> 03:47.309
- to whoever's on after you.
- [guard] Dixon.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.603
[woman] I'm afraid I'm going to have
to phone the station about this.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.856
- Anything could have happened.
- [guard] I understand.

03:52.023 --> 03:55.526
[woman] Maria, she's starting to clear
her husband's cupboard, so...

03:55.694 --> 03:57.069
- [Maria] Mm-hm.
- [woman 1] I may need your help.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.614
Can you bring up any cases
that you can find in the basement?

04:00.782 --> 04:02.533
[Maria] Of course.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.916
Mm!

04:14.337 --> 04:15.463
Beautiful day.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.007
- Mm...
- Oh, you've made a start.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.760
Carol's coming soon,
I'll get some bags.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.682
Anything you want to go to Mark,
I'll bring up a suitcase for it.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.731
Uh-uh.

04:33.899 --> 04:37.860
No, no, no, no. The grey.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.197
- You sure?
- Mm...

04:41.364 --> 04:43.783
[grunts]

04:49.289 --> 04:52.583
Definitely the grey.

04:52.751 --> 04:56.337
Righty oh. Boss knows best.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.215
[Denis humming]

05:01.802 --> 05:04.053
[water running]

05:05.430 --> 05:07.681
[Denis] Don't let her take
my paper away.

05:07.849 --> 05:11.227
Oh, I haven't had a chance
to look at that yet, dear.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.145
Sorry.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.816
[Denis] Atta girl.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.819
Ah! Damn!

05:19.986 --> 05:22.696
- Damn it.
- Blot it.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.325
- Blot it.
- Pardon?

05:26.493 --> 05:28.494
[stammers]

05:33.458 --> 05:34.959
You're supposed to be looking after her.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.545
[Denis] Now look what you've done.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.590
Are they to keep
the loonies out or you in?

05:41.758 --> 05:43.259
Hm...

05:44.803 --> 05:46.136
I'll be off then.

05:46.304 --> 05:51.225
Wear your scarf.
There is a chill out there.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.773
Good morning, Lady Thatcher.
Are you all right?

05:57.941 --> 06:02.403
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine, thank you, Susie.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.239
I've just been reading
about the bombings.

06:05.407 --> 06:10.035
- Of course. Frightful.
- [pop ringtone playing]

06:14.666 --> 06:16.375
- [phone beeps off]
- Sorry.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.963
These are the books for you to sign.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.549
I brought as many as I could find.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.510
Shall we go through your appointments?

06:28.138 --> 06:29.763
We said we'd go through them today.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.142
Yes. Of course, dear. Today.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.060
The invitation has come
from Downing Street

06:35.228 --> 06:38.188
for the unveiling of your portrait.
I'll put that on the mantelpiece,

06:38.356 --> 06:40.399
and there's an invitation
from Lord Armstrong

06:40.567 --> 06:43.193
for lunch on the first Friday
of next month.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.613
I said no, because you have
a concert that afternoon,

06:45.780 --> 06:47.281
but if you'd like to...

06:47.449 --> 06:49.909
It looks like a very
interesting program.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.202
What are they playing?

06:53.622 --> 06:57.249
Um, I think they said...

06:57.417 --> 06:59.877
...Rodgers & Hammerstein.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.837
Oh.

07:02.005 --> 07:07.968
["Shall We Dance" playing]

07:27.280 --> 07:29.031
[Margaret chuckles]

07:29.199 --> 07:31.116
Oh...

07:31.284 --> 07:34.995
- [music fades]
- [chuckles, snorts] Silly man.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.540
Oh, he hasn't got his scarf on.

08:00.730 --> 08:06.694
[distant booming]

08:11.449 --> 08:13.617
- [air-raid sirens blaring]
- [distant booming]

08:19.249 --> 08:23.293
- Did someone cover the butter?
- I'll go.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.753
- Leave it!
- Margaret.

08:24.921 --> 08:29.967
- [plane rumbling]
- [bombs exploding]

08:30.135 --> 08:31.593
[glassware rattling]

08:31.761 --> 08:33.429
[panting]

08:33.596 --> 08:34.847
Good girl.

08:36.850 --> 08:42.312
Tomorrow, no matter what they do,
it'll be business as usual.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.860
[woman] Two of the small beef,
Mr. Roberts.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.363
[man] What is the life blood
of any community?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.240
It's business.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.993
Not just big business,
but small businesses, like mine.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.494
[whispers] Margaret! Cups!

08:57.662 --> 09:00.164
[Mr. Roberts]
We on this island are strong.

09:00.331 --> 09:04.543
We're self-reliant. Sometimes,
we're plain bloody-minded.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.212
But we also believe
in helping each other.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.131
And I don't mean by state handouts.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.091
[girl] Margaret, do you want
to come to the pictures?

09:11.259 --> 09:13.093
[girl 2] She's not coming out,
she's got to study.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.512
- Miss Hoity-Toity!
- [laughing]

09:15.680 --> 09:19.349
[Mr. Roberts] Never run with the crowd,
Margaret. Go your own way.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.102
[echoing] Go your own way.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.604
[girls giggling]

09:23.772 --> 09:25.105
[Mr. Roberts] Never run with the crowd.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.273
Open it then.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.238
I've got a place at Oxford.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.784
[cries softly]

09:38.536 --> 09:40.454
Don't let me down, Margaret.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.582
Mother!

09:46.419 --> 09:47.878
My hands are still damp.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.931
"Margaret Roberts."

09:59.724 --> 10:01.725
Oh!

10:10.735 --> 10:14.279
- [woman softly] Tea.
- Margaret! Cups!

10:15.406 --> 10:19.618
- [murmuring voices]
- [girls giggling]

10:19.786 --> 10:23.080
[Denis]
They're talking about you again.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.457
Wha... What time is it?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.753
Sun's not quite over the yardarm.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.713
- It's time for tea.
- [phone rings]

10:31.881 --> 10:35.551
- [sighs]
- Look, Margaret.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.388
What have you got on your head?

10:39.556 --> 10:42.307
Found it in the cupboard,
and thought, bugger it,

10:42.475 --> 10:44.726
it's Friday, why not fancy dress?

10:44.894 --> 10:48.397
- You look ridiculous.
- [foreign accent] Boss lady no like?

10:48.565 --> 10:50.899
No, Denis, boss lady no like.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.402
[woman, hushed] She's made a start,
that's the main thing.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.530
No, no, no. It's going fine.

10:56.698 --> 11:00.701
But it's taken Carol eight years
to persuade her to let his things go.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.494
[quietly] Feet!

11:03.746 --> 11:06.206
[woman] Well, it's her pills.

11:06.374 --> 11:09.459
You can never be sure she's taking them.
I think sometimes she hides them.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.545
[Denis] Oh, rumbled!

11:11.713 --> 11:14.965
[woman] They give her about an hour's
clarity, then she slips again.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.383
[car door slams]

11:16.551 --> 11:19.178
[woman] Can I suggest you remove
the sticker from the back of your car?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.597
- [man] Sorry. It's always cash...
- [woman] Then take the sticker off!

11:21.764 --> 11:23.348
I call that false advertising,
wouldn't you?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.517
- I've got another...
- I would say keep the change,

11:25.685 --> 11:26.810
but there isn't any change.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.687
[woman] Hello, June. Any news?

11:28.855 --> 11:31.899
Look, I brought every single bag
I could find.

11:32.066 --> 11:37.237
[man on TV] He gave a speech recently,
trying to come up with a broad base...

11:37.405 --> 11:39.156
Hello, Ma.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.867
Bloody taxi driver
wouldn't take my card.

11:42.035 --> 11:46.914
I said don't have a sticker saying
you take Visa and then insist on cash.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.081
Oh! Can you believe it?

11:48.249 --> 11:51.084
Rummaging around the bottom of my bag.
He didn't get a tip.

11:54.589 --> 12:00.260
I didn't know that you were
dropping by today, dear.

12:00.428 --> 12:04.139
Yes, you said yesterday,
we were going to start on Dad's things.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.975
The cupboards,
then I was going to help you dress.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.269
- You've got Michael and...
- Jacqueline.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.898
- Coming for dinner tonight.
- Yes, of course.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.818
We're having halibut.

12:18.404 --> 12:22.115
[newscaster] This is a major
catastrophe that has struck our capital.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.952
- As you can see...
- Isn't it terrible?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.079
They think it's al-Qaeda.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.040
...are trying to get
all the people out of the building.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.794
The Prime Minister and his senior staff
were due to be staying at the hotel,

12:33.962 --> 12:35.170
- but checked out earlier.
- [Margaret] Denis!

12:35.338 --> 12:37.965
It'll be fine.
Come get your head down.

12:38.132 --> 12:41.093
- It's ten to three, for God's sake.
- [Margaret] Denis!

12:41.261 --> 12:43.011
[newscaster] At ten to three
this morning, an explosion

12:43.179 --> 12:45.931
extensively damaged
the Grand Hotel in Brighton...

12:46.099 --> 12:49.142
[newscaster 2]... Brighton, scene
of the Conservative Party conference.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.937
[newscaster] ...the Prime Minister and
a number of her Cabinet were staying.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.356
They escaped unhurt,
but it's reported that...

12:54.524 --> 12:55.983
[newscaster 2] Five people have died,

12:56.150 --> 12:58.151
many others are injured,
some critically.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.655
[newscaster 3] The IRA have claimed
responsibility.

13:03.366 --> 13:08.203
We must release a statement,
offering our condolences.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.580
I'm sure they've already...

13:10.748 --> 13:15.752
We must never, ever, ever
give in to terrorists.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.717
Is it warm in here?

13:23.428 --> 13:26.138
Now, Ma, are we going long
or just below the knee tonight?

13:26.306 --> 13:29.266
Oh, below the knee,
I should think.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.980
No! Don't... Don't move those.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.191
I haven't finished sorting.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.744
I hear you went out today.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.665
You mustn't go out on your own,
Mummy. We've talked about that.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.293
There was no milk.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.795
Call Robert, he'll get it
for you if June's not up.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.131
I am not for the knacker's yet.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.468
- [Denis] Now, take it easy, Margaret.
- No one's saying that.

14:06.804 --> 14:11.183
If I can't go out to buy a pint of milk,
what is the world coming to?

14:11.351 --> 14:17.105
Really, Carol.
Please don't fuss about it.

14:17.273 --> 14:21.777
You've always been like this,
fuss, fuss, fuss.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.821
You must find something better
to do with your time.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.742
It's most unattractive in a woman.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.787
When I was your age,

14:31.954 --> 14:36.583
the last thing I wanted to do
was fuss around my mother.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.587
Four down, nine letters.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.173
Something B,
something T, something N...

14:43.341 --> 14:47.219
Something, something, something.
Refusal to change course.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.972
- Obstinate.
- [laughs]

14:51.140 --> 14:53.141
- [Carol] What?
- [Denis] I knew you'd get it.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.686
Ob... I'll wear the pearls.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.524
I'll wear the pearls.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.783
[sighs]

15:09.951 --> 15:11.785
There they are.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.204
My little twins.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.625
Thank you, dear.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.962
It's nearly all familiar faces:

15:22.130 --> 15:25.257
- William, Michael and his lovely wife.
- Jacqueline.

15:25.425 --> 15:29.136
And then there's Peter,
James R, James T,

15:29.303 --> 15:32.472
and that very nice man
we met last year.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.809
- I remember.
- He's bringing his new lady friend,

15:35.977 --> 15:39.604
just to mix things up a bit,
because we're rather short of women,

15:39.772 --> 15:40.939
but I'm sure we'll manage.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.442
I've always preferred
the company of men.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.735
[men laughing]

15:47.321 --> 15:50.157
- Ma?
- [lively chattering]

15:54.495 --> 15:57.038
[chattering stops]

15:57.206 --> 16:02.419
[man] Ah, Miss Roberts. Hoping to be
chosen as our candidate for Parliament.

16:02.587 --> 16:06.673
Well, I don't like coalitions,
I never have.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.842
[lively chattering]

16:14.682 --> 16:16.266
[chattering fades]

16:16.434 --> 16:18.852
Start on the outside, work your way in.

16:19.020 --> 16:23.190
[man] Attlee has his sights set on
the steel industry, you mark my words.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.358
[man 2] They'll be nationalizing
the bloody air next.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.069
Yes, hold your breath, sir.
That's government property.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.321
Dreadful.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.824
Was your father a political man,
too, Miss Roberts?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.827
Oh, yes, to his core.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.038
And Mayor of Grantham.

16:38.206 --> 16:42.459
- And a grocer as well.
- [Margaret] Yes.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.754
And did you help... in the...

16:45.922 --> 16:48.840
- Oh, yes. It was a family business.
- ...shop?

16:49.008 --> 16:52.344
A very good starting point
for the political life, I'm sure.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.179
That and a degree from Oxford.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.269
[indistinct chattering]

17:01.437 --> 17:03.063
No, don't. Whiskey, please.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.191
[chattering continues]

17:10.695 --> 17:13.448
[Margaret] What I do think is
that a man should be encouraged

17:13.616 --> 17:15.617
to stand on his own two feet.

17:15.785 --> 17:19.287
Yes, we help people.
Of course we help people.

17:19.454 --> 17:23.959
But for those that can do,
they must just get up and do.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.253
And if something's wrong,
they shouldn't just whine about it,

17:27.421 --> 17:31.591
they should get in there and do
something about it, change things.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.970
With all due respect, Miss Roberts,
what may have served in Grantham...

17:35.137 --> 17:37.806
Can serve very well
for the people of Dartford, too.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.392
- Really?
- I know much more than those

17:40.560 --> 17:42.727
who have never lived
on a limited income.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.230
Just like the man or woman
in the street,

17:45.398 --> 17:49.985
when I am short one week,
I have to make economies the next.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.404
Nothing like a slice
of fiscal responsibility.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.240
[Margaret] A man might call it
fiscal responsibility,

17:55.408 --> 17:58.368
a woman
might call it good housekeeping.

17:58.536 --> 18:02.789
I'm not sure a home economics lesson

18:02.957 --> 18:06.793
is quite what the Dartford
constituents need.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.963
They see industry being nationalized,

18:10.131 --> 18:13.925
the unions on the up,
the pound on the slide.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.179
Whoever can sort that lot out,
he's my man.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.932
- Or woman?
- [chuckles]

18:24.186 --> 18:27.063
Ladies, shall we?

18:28.149 --> 18:31.234
[man] Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.375
[man] Well. That's told us!

18:47.543 --> 18:49.461
[laughter]

18:52.089 --> 18:55.800
So, Margaret, how would you have dealt
with this if you'd been Prime Minister?

18:57.595 --> 18:58.803
Where?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.598
[Carol] The bombings, Mummy.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.434
Today.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.645
We were just talking about them.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.231
No... yes.

19:10.399 --> 19:13.443
We have always lived alongside evil.

19:13.611 --> 19:17.822
But it has never been so patient,

19:17.990 --> 19:19.866
so avid for carnage,

19:20.034 --> 19:24.704
so eager to carry innocents
along with it into oblivion.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.122
Hear, hear.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.043
Western civilization
must root out this evil,

19:30.211 --> 19:33.588
wherever it hides, or she risks defeat

19:33.756 --> 19:38.009
at the hands of global terror
in a nuclear age. Unimaginable.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.886
The Prime Minister made a very
good statement, I thought.

19:40.054 --> 19:43.098
Yes. Clever man.
Quite a smoothie.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.433
[laughter]

19:45.601 --> 19:48.436
Miss Thatcher, it's been such
a pleasure to meet you.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.522
- You don't mind if I sit down.
- No, no.

19:50.690 --> 19:55.944
I heard you speak at the conference
in Brighton in 1984,

19:56.112 --> 19:59.322
just after the IRA
bombed the Grand Hotel.

19:59.490 --> 20:02.075
You were remarkable.

20:03.077 --> 20:05.954
I hope you appreciate
what an inspiration you've been

20:06.122 --> 20:08.581
to women like myself.

20:08.749 --> 20:13.586
Well, it used to be
about trying to do something.

20:13.754 --> 20:18.508
You see. Now, it's about
trying to be someone.

20:21.846 --> 20:26.641
- [man clears throat]
- Mm. Anyway, I... thank you.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.561
- Good night, Lady Thatcher.
- Good night to you.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.399
[man] I am so pleased to see
your mother looking so well.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.444
- [Carol] Yes, doesn't she.
- [man] She certainly does.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.779
[Carol] William, great to see you,
thank you so much for coming.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.240
[William] Thank you.
It was lovely, absolutely lovely.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.868
- [Carol] Can I call you a taxi?
- [William] No, no...

20:48.414 --> 20:51.458
OK, hold on to me, that's right.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.709
Ah.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.295
[sighs] Better.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.799
Do the clasp. I can't quite...

20:59.967 --> 21:03.052
- OK.
- [clears throat]

21:03.220 --> 21:04.220
Yes.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.767
- Oh, you have an eyelash.
- Oh?

21:08.934 --> 21:11.561
- Make a wish.
- [chuckles]

21:16.859 --> 21:18.777
[laughs]

21:21.739 --> 21:24.407
Oh, I spoke to Dr. Michael today.

21:25.910 --> 21:29.162
He's very good. Very expensive.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.833
I know you're not due
to see him for another month,

21:34.001 --> 21:37.545
but I've spoken to him
and he can fit you in tomorrow.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.256
Just for a checkup.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.677
Ma, please.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.097
What does Mark think about it?

21:49.225 --> 21:51.476
- Mark?
- Mm.

21:53.562 --> 21:57.190
Tell him to come up.
I want to talk to him about this.

21:58.943 --> 22:02.028
Mark's with Sarah and the children.

22:06.325 --> 22:10.578
Well, tell him to come up and see me
after he's kissed them good night,

22:10.746 --> 22:13.039
would you, Carol, darling?

22:30.808 --> 22:32.809
He's not here, Mummy.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.105
Mark lives in South Africa.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.944
And you're not Prime Minister anymore.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.118
And Dad is, uh...

22:50.286 --> 22:52.120
Dad is dead.

23:00.546 --> 23:03.089
You look exhausted, dear.

23:06.427 --> 23:11.180
You really must try
to get some sleep.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.143
[clears throat]

23:15.311 --> 23:19.230
Taxis will be few and far
between at this hour.

23:24.486 --> 23:27.447
Righty oh. Night-night, Ma.
Sleep well.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.949
Good night, dear.

23:44.381 --> 23:48.343
- [orchestral music playing]
- [chorus singing]

23:53.766 --> 23:57.352
[woman singing "Casta Diva"]

24:16.622 --> 24:19.248
[radio announcer] Twenty-four-year-old
Miss Margaret Roberts lost her bid

24:19.416 --> 24:22.460
to win a seat in Parliament today,
but she has put new life

24:22.628 --> 24:24.796
into the Dartford
Conservative Association.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.423
Winning candidate, Mr. Dodds,
had better watch out.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.301
This bright young woman is on his tail.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.307
[chuckles]

24:40.688 --> 24:44.440
- Eat.
- Oh. Disaster.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.276
Hang on. Hang on.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.529
Hang on.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.535
You shaved thousands off their
majority. You did splendidly.

24:55.703 --> 24:58.037
Not splendidly enough.

24:58.205 --> 25:01.874
Ah, I see. Self-pity.

25:03.085 --> 25:06.170
No one's saying
you don't need a safe seat.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.089
You deserve a safe seat.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.552
But it does not come unless
you learn to play the game a little.

25:12.720 --> 25:16.014
- What game?
- You're a grocer's daughter.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.225
- And proud of being...
- And in their eyes...

25:20.728 --> 25:23.146
...a single grocer's daughter.

25:24.189 --> 25:27.066
But if you were to become the wife
of a moderately successful businessman,

25:27.234 --> 25:29.402
then you'd get to Parliament.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.488
And I'd get to be the happiest man in...

25:33.073 --> 25:35.616
...wherever they select you.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.049
Margaret, will you marry me?

25:51.216 --> 25:53.217
[breath trembling]

25:56.055 --> 25:57.722
Well?

26:01.810 --> 26:03.603
Yes.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.688
Yes!

26:07.316 --> 26:09.108
- Oh...
- What?

26:09.276 --> 26:11.486
I love you so much, but...

26:11.653 --> 26:14.739
...I will never be one
of those women, Denis,

26:14.907 --> 26:18.326
who stays silent and pretty
on the arm of her husband.

26:18.494 --> 26:23.498
Or remote and alone in the kitchen,
doing the washing-up, for that matter.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.957
We'll get a help for that.

26:25.125 --> 26:30.963
No. One's life must matter, Denis.

26:31.131 --> 26:34.634
Beyond all the cooking
and the cleaning and the children,

26:34.802 --> 26:37.762
one's life must mean more than that.

26:38.472 --> 26:42.809
I cannot die washing up a tea cup.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.728
I mean it, Denis.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.397
Say you understand.

26:48.565 --> 26:52.235
That's why I want to marry you, my dear.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.529
Oh. [cries softly]

27:05.082 --> 27:06.874
[laughs]

27:09.711 --> 27:11.587
Now eat.

27:13.132 --> 27:17.969
["Shall We Dance" playing]

27:49.877 --> 27:53.713
- [chuckling]
- [music fades]

27:59.136 --> 28:00.344
Oh!

28:01.305 --> 28:02.722
Oh...

28:07.394 --> 28:09.187
There we go.

28:15.819 --> 28:18.779
There they are, my little twins.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.409
[seagulls crying]

28:28.916 --> 28:31.584
[Margaret] Oh... Mark.

28:34.463 --> 28:35.671
[Denis] Cornwall, wasn't it?

28:35.839 --> 28:37.757
Bloody hell.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.135
[Margaret laughs]

28:41.303 --> 28:43.888
[Denis] Look at 'em, little imps.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.228
You never really got golf,
did you? [laughs]

28:52.397 --> 28:54.232
You look happy.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.692
Yes, I do, don't I?

28:56.860 --> 28:58.819
You're drinking too much.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.492
Whatcha doing?
Not like you, looking back.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.995
Don't want to dig around too deep, M,
don't know what you might find.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.416
You can rewind it,
but you can't change it.

29:14.711 --> 29:17.880
[Margaret] They grow up
so fast, don't they?

29:30.060 --> 29:33.062
[boy laughing]

29:33.230 --> 29:35.273
[Margaret chuckles]

29:38.652 --> 29:39.902
Mark.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.864
Oh...

29:56.503 --> 29:58.045
[man] Mr. Eric Deakins,

29:58.213 --> 30:02.758
Labor, 13,437.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.641
Mr. Ivan Spence, Liberal,

30:10.809 --> 30:14.937
12,260.

30:15.105 --> 30:18.524
- [cheering]
- We won!

30:18.692 --> 30:21.694
Mrs. Margaret Thatcher,
Conservative,

30:21.862 --> 30:25.573
29,697.

30:25.741 --> 30:29.410
I can now announce the new
Member of Parliament for Finchley,

30:29.578 --> 30:31.996
- 1959...
- Come along, please!

30:32.164 --> 30:34.457
...Mrs. Margaret Thatcher.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.341
[children shouting]

30:43.508 --> 30:45.551
Please!

30:45.719 --> 30:47.428
Mummy, don't go!

30:47.596 --> 30:49.138
[engine starts]

30:49.306 --> 30:52.558
[children shouting]

30:52.726 --> 30:56.645
You promised! Hey! Mummy!

30:56.813 --> 30:59.023
Wait, Mummy!

31:00.067 --> 31:03.235
Please don't go!

31:52.202 --> 31:54.161
[high heels clicking]

32:04.047 --> 32:06.048
[lively chattering]

32:06.216 --> 32:07.758
[chattering stops]

32:07.926 --> 32:08.926
No.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.720
- [door creaking]
- [man] Oh!

32:15.976 --> 32:18.436
[men's voices murmuring]

32:22.357 --> 32:23.899
[man] Mrs. Thatcher.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.235
Excuse me. Sorry.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.529
Mrs. Thatcher, Airey Neave.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.699
Welcome to the madhouse.
Follow me.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.628
[Speaker] The Honorable Lady,
the Member of Parliament for Finchley!

32:44.796 --> 32:47.548
[loud arguing]

32:57.476 --> 33:00.227
Order! Order!

33:00.395 --> 33:03.439
The Right Honorable Lady,
the Secretary of State for Education.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.441
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

33:05.609 --> 33:09.111
The Right Honorable Gentleman
knows very well that we had no choice

33:09.279 --> 33:11.780
- but to close the schools.
- [shouting]

33:11.948 --> 33:14.867
- Shame!
- Disgrace!

33:16.244 --> 33:19.371
Because his union paymasters

33:19.539 --> 33:23.042
have called a strike deliberately
to cripple our economy.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.960
[arguing]

33:25.128 --> 33:28.172
- Rubbish!
- Teachers cannot teach

33:28.340 --> 33:32.259
when there is no heating,
no lighting in their classrooms.

33:32.427 --> 33:36.013
And I ask the Right Honorable
Gentleman, whose fault is that?

33:36.181 --> 33:38.140
[shouting] Yours!

33:42.312 --> 33:46.106
Methinks the Right Honorable
Lady doth screech too much.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.816
[laughter]

33:49.819 --> 33:52.821
And if she wants us
to take her seriously,

33:52.989 --> 33:55.199
she must learn to calm down!

33:55.367 --> 33:57.535
[laughter]

33:57.702 --> 34:00.704
- Very good!
- If the Right Honorable Gentleman

34:00.872 --> 34:04.250
could perhaps attend more closely
to what I am saying,

34:04.417 --> 34:07.336
rather than how I am saying it,

34:07.504 --> 34:12.341
he may receive a valuable
education in spite of himself!

34:12.509 --> 34:14.092
[laughter, murmuring]

34:14.261 --> 34:18.847
Why has... Why has this
Conservative government failed?

34:19.014 --> 34:21.433
- [arguing]
- It hasn't failed.

34:21.601 --> 34:25.271
[man] Why has it forced
so many in the public sector

34:25.438 --> 34:29.733
into taking strike action
to save their own jobs?

34:29.900 --> 34:34.280
[shouting]

34:34.447 --> 34:39.243
Minister, the breakdown
in essential public services,

34:39.411 --> 34:43.121
in transport, in electricity,
in sanitation,

34:43.290 --> 34:45.416
is not the fault of the trade unions.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.835
It's entirely the fault
of the trade unions.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.087
But of this Conservative government

34:50.255 --> 34:52.715
in which you so shamefully serve!

34:52.882 --> 34:56.135
[shouting]

34:56.303 --> 34:58.762
[indistinct conversation]

35:06.938 --> 35:11.108
[man] These power cuts will continue
unless we can reach a compromise.

35:11.276 --> 35:15.070
The miners are asking
for a 35 percent increase in wages.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.906
Obviously, we can't
go anywhere near that.

35:18.074 --> 35:21.118
The unions are not our enemies
and never have been.

35:21.286 --> 35:24.872
We want, and have always wanted,
the broadest consensus.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.042
- Hear, hear.
- I'm sure we are all in agreement

35:28.209 --> 35:29.752
that we must do nothing for the moment

35:29.919 --> 35:32.004
that will further inflame
the current situation.

35:32.172 --> 35:34.048
- Hear, hear, Prime Minister.
- The fact of the matter is,

35:34.215 --> 35:37.009
it's absolutely crucial
that we are seen by the public

35:37.177 --> 35:41.013
to be acting as conciliators
and not aggressors.

35:41.181 --> 35:43.349
Hear, hear.

35:46.102 --> 35:49.355
- Yes, Education Secretary.
- Yes, Prime Minister.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.273
With the miners' union leader today

35:51.441 --> 35:54.610
calling for the army to mutiny
in support of the strikes,

35:54.778 --> 35:57.321
this seems the wrong time
for conciliation.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.659
- [groaning]
- [Prime Minister] Be patient.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.869
They'll come back on
again in a moment.

36:04.037 --> 36:07.122
- Anybody got a shilling?
- Ah, Boy Scout.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.749
Be prepared.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.918
Thank you, Margaret.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.753
Oh! It lives.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.589
Your thoughts are duly noted.

36:19.052 --> 36:22.513
[Prime Minister echoing] Compromise,
compromise, compromise...

36:22.681 --> 36:25.516
[Mr. Roberts]
We on this island are strong.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.559
We're self-reliant.

36:27.727 --> 36:31.063
Napoleon called us a nation
of shopkeepers.

36:31.231 --> 36:33.649
He meant it as an insult,
but to me it's a compliment.

36:33.817 --> 36:37.319
That's why he couldn't beat us,
that's why Hitler can't beat us.

36:40.156 --> 36:43.534
We Conservatives believe
in giving people the freedom

36:43.702 --> 36:48.038
and opportunity to fulfill their own
potential, especially the young.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.666
There's no good in pretending we're
all equal, we're not all the same,

36:50.834 --> 36:53.544
never have been, never will be.

36:53.712 --> 36:59.508
We should encourage our children
to aspire to achieve more than we have,

36:59.676 --> 37:03.178
for our children today
will be the leaders of tomorrow.

37:03.346 --> 37:04.388
[applause]

37:05.557 --> 37:08.434
[man on radio] It's 1974,
you'd think it was World War Il.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.103
Blackouts, no petrol. It's a mess.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.272
Heath should resign now and make way

37:13.440 --> 37:15.399
for someone who's not afraid
to tackle the unions.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.818
[Carol] I swear, it's all gone
completely out of my head.

37:17.986 --> 37:20.070
My driving instructor says
I should pass, but I feel

37:20.238 --> 37:22.948
as if I've hardly had any lessons.
Which is ridiculous, isn't it?

37:23.116 --> 37:25.576
- Maybe third time lucky.
- Right.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.996
The only thing you should
remember is that everyone else

37:29.164 --> 37:33.375
is either reckless or inept.
Usually both.

37:33.543 --> 37:37.296
One must be brave if one
is to take the wheel.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.715
- Right oh.
- Right, move.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.175
Move to your right a little bit.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.635
But if I move to the right, aren't
I on the wrong side of the road?

37:43.803 --> 37:45.554
- Carol!
- Well, he's in the way!

37:45.722 --> 37:47.347
- To the right. Move to the right!
- [Carol screams]

37:47.515 --> 37:49.808
- [tires screech]
- Hey! Look out!

37:49.976 --> 37:52.978
So sorry! Terribly sorry!

37:53.146 --> 37:55.522
[laughing]

37:58.359 --> 38:00.152
[Carol] Hey, look at me, driving!

38:00.320 --> 38:01.820
Thanks, Ma, that was terrific!

38:01.988 --> 38:03.655
I really feel like I've got
a handle on it now.

38:03.823 --> 38:04.990
You should have seen us, Pa.

38:05.158 --> 38:08.285
Are you trying to cook
your own breakfast?

38:08.453 --> 38:10.829
- Denis!
- I can boil a bloody egg.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.039
Mummy took me for a test drive.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.208
We went absolutely everywhere.
All over the place.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.961
- Yeah?
- I've decided. I'm going to run.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.254
What for?

38:21.132 --> 38:24.593
I'm going to run
for Leader of the Party.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.350
- [Carol] Silly me!
- [Denis] Good luck!

38:31.518 --> 38:33.185
[Carol] All the time I thought
I was having a driving lesson,

38:33.353 --> 38:35.479
it was all about my mother,
just for a change!

38:35.647 --> 38:38.524
- What's she on about?
- [Denis] Her driving test this morning!

38:38.691 --> 38:42.152
- Oh, right. Of course.
- Are you saying you want

38:42.320 --> 38:43.570
to be Prime Minister?

38:43.738 --> 38:49.576
Oh! What I'm saying is that
someone must force the point,

38:49.744 --> 38:51.829
someone must say the un-sayable.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.206
None of these men have the guts.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.333
- [bell rings]
- The Prime Minister has been

38:56.501 --> 38:58.210
very loyal to you, MT.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.921
But he's weak,
and he's weakened the party.

39:02.298 --> 39:05.050
One must know when to go.

39:05.218 --> 39:06.760
You're shaking. Here, let me...

39:06.928 --> 39:08.512
I can do it!

39:08.680 --> 39:10.889
Goodness me!

39:13.685 --> 39:15.352
What is the matter
with everyone this morning?

39:15.520 --> 39:17.104
I've told you what the matter is.

39:17.272 --> 39:18.856
The business is a bit rocky
at the moment

39:19.023 --> 39:20.399
and the doctor says I need a rest.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.901
Do you need a rest?

39:23.069 --> 39:25.237
Oh, God.

39:25.405 --> 39:28.407
We both know it's highly unlikely

39:28.575 --> 39:30.200
that I would ever be elected leader.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.620
I'll never be elected leader.
But I will run. I will run.

39:33.788 --> 39:37.749
Just to nip at their heels and make them
reaffirm the principles on which

39:37.917 --> 39:40.794
- the Conservative Party must stand.
- [toaster pops]

39:43.923 --> 39:46.800
There's so much to do.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.469
You're insufferable,
Margaret, do you know that?

39:51.931 --> 39:53.807
Denis, you married someone

39:53.975 --> 39:58.103
who is committed to public service,
you knew that.

39:58.271 --> 40:01.148
- And it is my duty...
- Don't call it duty.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.276
It's ambition that's gotten
you this far. Ambition.

40:04.444 --> 40:09.156
And the rest of us, me, the children,
we can all go to hell!

40:10.575 --> 40:13.243
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!

40:13.411 --> 40:15.370
Where did you go?

40:15.538 --> 40:17.706
- South Africa.
- Yes.

40:17.874 --> 40:21.919
[Denis] How many days passed
before you realized I'd gone?

40:22.086 --> 40:24.922
Probably had to ask
the cleaning woman where I was.

40:25.089 --> 40:28.050
When did I lose track of everyone?

40:29.093 --> 40:31.511
- Too busy climbing the greasy pole, MT.
- How did I...?

40:31.679 --> 40:33.847
[man on TV] Mrs. Thatcher,
I understand you recently visited

40:34.015 --> 40:36.224
- the United States of America.
- Oh, oh...

40:36.392 --> 40:39.561
What is it you took away
from your visit which may be of value,

40:39.729 --> 40:43.565
- here in Great Britain?
- That's rather easy to answer.

40:43.733 --> 40:47.069
They are unafraid of success.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.280
We in Great Britain and in Europe

40:50.448 --> 40:53.200
are formed mostly by our history.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.912
They, on the other hand,
are formed by their philosophy.

40:57.080 --> 41:00.624
Not by what has been,
but by what can be.

41:00.792 --> 41:04.211
Oh, we have a great deal that
we can learn from them, yes.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.754
Oh, yes!

41:10.426 --> 41:12.052
Well...

41:13.513 --> 41:15.430
Uh...

41:17.392 --> 41:20.811
For a start, that hat has got to go.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.562
And the pearls.

41:22.730 --> 41:27.067
In fact,
I think all hats may have to go.

41:27.235 --> 41:31.863
You look and sound like
a privileged Conservative wife,

41:32.031 --> 41:33.490
and we've already got her vote.

41:33.658 --> 41:36.702
You've got lovely hair,
but we need to do something

41:36.869 --> 41:38.620
with it, to make it more...

41:38.788 --> 41:41.623
- Important.
- Yes. Give it more impact.

41:41.791 --> 41:44.584
But the main thing is your voice.

41:44.752 --> 41:47.212
It's too high,
and it has no authority.

41:47.380 --> 41:50.215
Methinks the lady
doth screech too much.

41:50.383 --> 41:54.219
People don't want to be harangued
by a woman or hectored.

41:54.387 --> 41:58.849
Persuaded, yes. That "Oh, yes,"
at the end of the interview,

41:59.017 --> 42:01.476
that's authoritative,
that's the voice of a leader.

42:01.644 --> 42:03.186
Quite.

42:03.354 --> 42:07.024
It's all very well to talk
about changing my voice, Mr. Reece,

42:07.191 --> 42:12.404
but for some of my colleagues to imagine
me as their leader...

42:12.572 --> 42:15.532
...would be like imagining,
I don't know,

42:15.700 --> 42:18.160
being led into battle
by their chambermaid.

42:18.327 --> 42:21.329
It's my background and my sex.

42:22.457 --> 42:27.002
No matter how I've tried,
and I have tried, to fit in,

42:27.170 --> 42:29.588
I know I will never be
truly one of them.

42:29.756 --> 42:32.924
If I may say so, I think
that's your trump card.

42:33.092 --> 42:36.136
You're flying in the face of everything
the Tories have been thus far.

42:36.304 --> 42:39.973
It's really terribly exciting.

42:40.141 --> 42:44.061
One simply has
to maximize your appeal,

42:44.228 --> 42:46.438
bring out all your qualities,

42:46.606 --> 42:50.484
and make you look, and sound,
like the leader that you could be.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.444
You've got it in you
to go the whole distance.

42:52.612 --> 42:53.904
Absolutely.

42:54.072 --> 42:57.783
What... Prime Minister?

42:59.410 --> 43:03.622
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

43:03.790 --> 43:05.457
In Britain?

43:05.625 --> 43:09.711
There will be no
female Prime Minister here,

43:09.879 --> 43:13.381
not in my lifetime. No.

43:13.549 --> 43:17.511
And I told Airey, I don't
expect to win the leadership,

43:17.678 --> 43:21.640
but I am going to run,
just to shake up the party.

43:21.808 --> 43:25.310
Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree.

43:25.478 --> 43:28.647
If you want to change this party,
lead it.

43:28.815 --> 43:30.440
If you want to change
the country, lead it.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.485
What we're talking
about here today is surface.

43:33.653 --> 43:36.905
What's crucial is
that you hold your course,

43:37.073 --> 43:38.907
and stay true to who you are.

43:39.075 --> 43:41.326
Never be anything
other than yourself.

43:41.494 --> 43:43.870
Leave us to do the rest.

43:50.878 --> 43:54.172
Gentlemen, I am in your hands.

43:54.340 --> 43:58.093
I may be persuaded
to surrender the hat.

43:58.261 --> 44:02.305
But the pearls were a gift from my
husband on the birth of our twins,

44:02.473 --> 44:05.267
and, um,

44:05.434 --> 44:09.187
they are absolutely non-negotiable.

44:10.690 --> 44:13.066
And... [vocalizing]

44:13.234 --> 44:15.110
[vocalizing]

44:15.278 --> 44:18.071
Good, I think we can lose
the handbag, Mrs. Thatcher. Yes?

44:19.031 --> 44:20.907
And hands down by side.

44:21.075 --> 44:24.828
- [vocalizing] Right up.
- [vocalizing]

44:24.996 --> 44:26.580
[both vocalizing]

44:26.747 --> 44:29.916
Because this isn't about the voice,
it's about belief.

44:30.084 --> 44:34.254
The very core. So a nice deep breath
and really fill out against my hands.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.423
[both vocalizing]

44:39.385 --> 44:40.802
You're calling Mr. Thatcher,
how would you do that?

44:40.970 --> 44:43.471
- Denis.
- Yes, I want authority.

44:43.639 --> 44:44.973
- I want conviction, I want...
- Denis.

44:45.141 --> 44:47.517
That's right, one more time,
and breathing in. And...

44:47.685 --> 44:48.852
Denis.

44:49.020 --> 44:52.981
- Yes, M!
- Sorry. No, no, no.

44:54.609 --> 44:57.319
[Margaret] You are the backbone
of our nation!

44:57.486 --> 44:59.779
Small firms like
Loveday's Ice Cream.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.907
- So nice to meet you, ladies.
- Nice to meet you.

45:02.074 --> 45:05.660
I'll just have a small one,
because I'm watching my figure.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.996
Whoo! That's for you, young man!

45:08.164 --> 45:10.749
[Margaret] I passionately
believe that it's the growth

45:10.917 --> 45:13.710
of small businesses
into larger ones

45:13.878 --> 45:16.129
that is critical for Britain's future.

45:16.297 --> 45:19.382
Well, it has to be something icy
on a stick for Denis.

45:19.550 --> 45:23.595
That's the only way
that we will produce jobs,

45:23.763 --> 45:26.389
real jobs, jobs that sustain.

45:29.477 --> 45:33.230
The Trade Union Movement
was founded to protect workers.

45:33.397 --> 45:38.318
Now it persecutes them.
It stops them from working.

45:38.486 --> 45:42.072
It is killing jobs and it is bringing
this country to its knees.

45:42.240 --> 45:45.784
I say enough.
It's time to get up.

45:45.952 --> 45:47.953
It's time to go to work.

45:48.120 --> 45:52.874
It's time to put the "Great"
back into Great Britain!

45:54.085 --> 45:55.669
[man] The incompetence
of the Labor government...

45:55.836 --> 45:58.088
- [vocalizing]
- ...continue to misinform

45:58.256 --> 46:02.467
and spend in this incessant
and blasÃ© manner.

46:02.635 --> 46:05.553
- We have paid the price...
- Mrs. Thatcher, they're ready for you.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.181
- Thank you.
- Give 'em hell.

46:08.349 --> 46:09.599
- [applause]
- You look magnificent.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.268
Next stop, Prime Minister.

46:11.435 --> 46:13.228
- Oh, Airey...
- Let's go.

46:13.396 --> 46:14.938
[man] The new leader
of the Conservative Party,

46:15.106 --> 46:18.316
- Margaret Thatcher!
- [cheering, whistling]

46:29.245 --> 46:31.413
[applause fades]

46:36.294 --> 46:38.128
[sniffles] Hm...

46:43.718 --> 46:45.593
- [Airey] Good night, Margaret.
- Oh...

46:45.761 --> 46:47.971
My money's on the filly to win.

46:48.139 --> 46:51.808
[laughs] Oh...
Thanks, Airey. Good night.

46:56.564 --> 47:01.192
- [loud booming]
- [debris clattering]

47:01.360 --> 47:02.569
No!

47:02.737 --> 47:05.739
No, no! No! Airey!

47:07.241 --> 47:08.450
Airey!

47:10.244 --> 47:11.995
[no audible dialogue]

47:13.414 --> 47:15.582
[newscaster] The Irish National
Liberation Army has claimed

47:15.750 --> 47:18.835
responsibility
for the death of MP Airey Neave,

47:19.003 --> 47:22.172
Margaret Thatcher's spokesman
on Northern Ireland.

47:33.642 --> 47:36.644
[Airey] If you want
to change the party, lead it.

47:36.812 --> 47:39.856
If you want to change
the country, lead it.

47:40.024 --> 47:43.443
You've got it in you
to go the whole distance.

47:45.404 --> 47:50.200
- [up-tempo music plays]
- Now, as the test draws near,

47:50.368 --> 47:52.577
- I ask your help.
- [applause]

47:52.745 --> 47:56.831
That together we can shake off
the shackles of Socialism

47:56.999 --> 48:01.419
and restore to greatness this
country that we love...

48:01.587 --> 48:05.799
And the only way is
for the Conservative Party to win!

48:05.966 --> 48:07.175
[applause]

48:07.343 --> 48:10.345
[newscaster] Is she gonna get there?
Watch those blocks rise...

48:10.513 --> 48:12.472
Go, Maggie!

48:34.912 --> 48:37.664
[newscaster] It's Friday the 4th
of May, an historic day for Britain,

48:37.832 --> 48:41.209
a Conservative government
led by Mrs. Thatcher is set to lead...

48:41.377 --> 48:44.129
[newscaster 2] Mrs. Bandaranaike
in Sri Lanka, Mrs. Gandhi in India,

48:44.296 --> 48:47.006
but never in the West has there
ever been a woman Prime Minister.

48:47.174 --> 48:49.634
[newscaster 3] The place that she has
now secured in British history,

48:49.802 --> 48:52.220
as the first woman ever to be
invited to form a government.

48:52.388 --> 48:54.681
The bonus of one of the most
famous addresses in the world,

48:54.849 --> 48:56.307
Number 10 Downing Street.

48:56.475 --> 48:59.686
This is it.
Steady the buffs, old girl.

49:08.529 --> 49:11.239
- Good afternoon.
- Congratulations, Prime Minister.

49:11.407 --> 49:14.200
- [cheering]
- I should just like to say

49:14.368 --> 49:18.037
that I take very seriously
the trust placed in me

49:18.205 --> 49:23.001
by the British people today,
and I will work hard every day

49:23.169 --> 49:25.670
to live up to that responsibility.

49:25.838 --> 49:28.756
And now, I should like to share with you

49:28.924 --> 49:32.343
a prayer of St. Francis of Assisi.

49:35.014 --> 49:39.851
Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony.

49:40.019 --> 49:43.813
Where there is error,
may we bring truth.

49:44.523 --> 49:48.735
Where there is doubt,
may we bring faith.

49:48.903 --> 49:53.531
And where there is despair,
may we bring hope.

50:04.752 --> 50:06.961
- Shoulders back, tummies in!
- [laughter]

50:07.129 --> 50:10.006
- [speaks indistinctly]
- Thank you, Michael.

50:10.174 --> 50:13.760
- [laughs]
- [man] Look this way, please.

50:13.928 --> 50:15.220
Three, two, one.

50:25.105 --> 50:28.942
[Carol] Robert, could you bring the car
around? She's been ready for ages.

50:29.985 --> 50:32.820
[muttering]

50:33.489 --> 50:36.991
I am perfectly healthy.

50:37.576 --> 50:40.495
No need for any of this.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.997
Just let them look
under the bonnet, MT.

50:43.165 --> 50:45.458
Make sure everything is hunky dory.

50:45.626 --> 50:50.129
Oh, really, this is
becoming quite tiresome.

50:50.297 --> 50:52.298
- What is?
- You.

50:52.466 --> 50:58.096
I was on my own
for 24 years before I met you,

50:58.264 --> 51:02.433
and I can manage perfectly well
without you now.

51:03.435 --> 51:05.979
So will you please go away,

51:06.146 --> 51:08.815
and stop bothering me?

51:08.983 --> 51:12.694
Just look straight ahead,
straight at me, that's it.

51:12.861 --> 51:15.738
- Are you noticing night sweats?
- No.

51:16.657 --> 51:20.076
- Hallucinations?
- No.

51:21.620 --> 51:25.081
- Sleep?
- Yes. I sleep.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.417
Four, five hours a night.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.586
So you wake early?

51:29.753 --> 51:33.256
And I stay up late. I always have.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.508
We just want to keep
abreast of it, that's all.

51:35.676 --> 51:38.428
Yes. Of course.

51:38.596 --> 51:40.972
Grief is a very natural state.

51:41.140 --> 51:44.058
My husband has
been gone for years.

51:44.226 --> 51:46.185
Cancer.

51:46.353 --> 51:50.148
Carol says you've decided to let his
things go. Probably a good thing.

51:50.316 --> 51:53.067
Yes. It was my idea. To Oxfam.

51:53.235 --> 51:57.405
Perfectly good stuff.
People can use these things.

51:57.573 --> 51:59.324
Hm...

51:59.491 --> 52:01.618
Still, it must be a bit disorientating.

52:01.785 --> 52:05.163
- You are bound to be feeling...
- What?

52:06.832 --> 52:10.084
What am I "bound to be feeling"?

52:12.463 --> 52:15.256
People don't think anymore.
They feel.

52:15.424 --> 52:18.843
"How are you feeling?"
"Oh, I don't feel comfortable."

52:19.011 --> 52:21.763
"Oh, I'm so sorry,
we, the group, we're feeling..."

52:21.930 --> 52:26.142
[clears throat] Do you know,
one of the great problems of our age

52:26.310 --> 52:29.812
is that we are governed by people
who care more about feelings

52:29.980 --> 52:33.358
than they do about thoughts and ideas?

52:33.525 --> 52:37.570
Now, thoughts and ideas,
that interests me.

52:37.738 --> 52:40.948
Ask me what I am thinking.

52:41.116 --> 52:43.534
What are you thinking, Margaret?

52:44.995 --> 52:47.538
Watch your thoughts,
for they become words.

52:47.706 --> 52:50.958
Watch your words,
for they become actions.

52:52.336 --> 52:56.172
Watch your actions,
for they become habits.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.842
Watch your habits,
for they become your character.

53:00.010 --> 53:04.305
And watch your character,
for it becomes your destiny.

53:04.473 --> 53:06.724
What we think, we become.

53:08.143 --> 53:11.020
My father always said that.

53:11.188 --> 53:14.065
And I think I am fine.

53:14.233 --> 53:16.776
[buzzer sounds]

53:19.321 --> 53:22.907
But I do so appreciate
your kind concern.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.120
[buzzer sounds]

53:29.581 --> 53:31.457
Oh, do please answer that.

53:31.625 --> 53:34.043
It might be someone
who needs you.

53:37.172 --> 53:39.549
I'll give Carol a quick ring,
let her know we're back,

53:39.717 --> 53:42.301
and then I'll put your
electric blanket on.

53:43.846 --> 53:47.014
[Denis] Steady, steady, steady!

53:48.434 --> 53:51.728
Damn. Fore!

53:51.895 --> 53:54.772
What about that medicine man, eh?

53:54.940 --> 53:57.942
Ah. Cold supper.

53:58.110 --> 54:00.820
Standards are slipping, Margaret.

54:01.697 --> 54:04.240
You really gave it to that
quack, didn't you, darling?

54:04.408 --> 54:08.202
Just like the old days.
Hallucinations, my eye!

54:08.370 --> 54:11.622
How dare he? But then, you give us
all the runaround, don't you?

54:13.751 --> 54:18.755
I know you can hear me, sweetheart,
so there's no use pretending you can't.

54:19.798 --> 54:22.508
Enough. Denis, enough!

54:22.676 --> 54:24.510
Dismissed!

54:31.977 --> 54:34.687
She does it in the end. Kills him.

54:37.065 --> 54:39.525
I don't know why you're
being so scratchy.

54:39.693 --> 54:41.694
It's not as if you've
got anyone else to talk to.

54:41.862 --> 54:45.531
[Margaret] "When the Himalayan peasant
meets the he-bear in his pride..."

54:45.699 --> 54:49.744
It's a marvel to me that you can still
quote whole chunks of Kipling,

54:49.912 --> 54:52.288
but try remembering the name
of that woman who just made you

54:52.456 --> 54:55.166
that god-awful cold collation.

54:55.334 --> 54:57.877
No? Come on, you can do it.

54:58.045 --> 55:00.046
Month of the year.

55:00.214 --> 55:02.048
One syllable.

55:02.216 --> 55:04.550
Rhymes with moon.

55:04.718 --> 55:06.302
- June.
- June! Bingo!

55:06.470 --> 55:08.888
Knew you'd get there in the end.

55:09.056 --> 55:14.018
"When the Himalayan peasant
meets the he-bear in his pride,

55:14.186 --> 55:17.438
he shouts to scare the monster,
who will often turn aside."

55:17.606 --> 55:19.732
- [TV playing loudly]
- "But the she-bear, thus accosted,

55:19.900 --> 55:22.235
rends the peasant tooth and nail,

55:22.402 --> 55:25.905
for the female of the species
is more deadly than the male."

55:26.073 --> 55:28.908
- [classical music plays loudly]
- "When Nag, the basking cobra,

55:29.076 --> 55:31.369
hears the careless foot of man..."
[continues indistinctly]

55:31.537 --> 55:34.288
[whirring loudly]

55:36.041 --> 55:38.167
[radio plays loudly]

55:38.335 --> 55:40.962
[whirring loudly]

55:41.129 --> 55:45.132
[cacophony blaring]

55:47.219 --> 55:50.388
If I can't hear you, I can't see you.

55:50.556 --> 55:52.974
If I can't see you, you're not here.

55:53.141 --> 55:57.019
And if you're not here,
I'm not going mad.

55:57.187 --> 55:58.646
I will not go mad.

55:58.814 --> 56:01.107
[echoing] I won't go mad...
I will not go mad...

56:01.275 --> 56:04.318
I will not go mad. I will not.

56:04.486 --> 56:07.697
[newscaster] Baroness Thatcher made
an apparently routine visit

56:07.865 --> 56:09.073
to her doctors today.

56:09.241 --> 56:11.033
Although rarely seen in public,

56:11.201 --> 56:14.120
Britain's longest-serving
Prime Minister of the twentieth century,

56:14.288 --> 56:16.956
remains a controversial figure.

56:17.124 --> 56:20.626
Almost lovingly dubbed
by the Soviets "The Iron Lady,"

56:20.794 --> 56:23.212
she is credited,
with her friend Ronald Reagan,

56:23.380 --> 56:26.132
with a decisive role
in the ending of the Cold War.

56:26.300 --> 56:28.843
- Margaret...
- Her supporters claim she transformed

56:29.011 --> 56:32.346
the British economy and reversed
the country's post-war decline.

56:32.514 --> 56:34.432
- I am so sorry.
- Her detractors blame

56:34.600 --> 56:38.060
her savage public spending cuts
and sweeping privatization of...

56:38.228 --> 56:42.106
- [TV stops playing]
- [classical music playing loudly]

56:42.274 --> 56:43.816
- [music stops]
- [machines whirring]

56:43.984 --> 56:48.070
- [whirring stops]
- I... don't recognize myself.

56:59.958 --> 57:01.542
Hm...

57:12.179 --> 57:14.931
[Denis] Am I out of the doghouse yet?

57:17.100 --> 57:22.396
Oh. They're unveiling
that portrait of me

57:22.564 --> 57:24.649
at Number 10 next month.

57:24.816 --> 57:26.400
Mm.

57:27.945 --> 57:31.864
Yes, it's... the invitation,
it's on the mantelpiece.

57:32.032 --> 57:34.992
So it'll be Churchill,

57:35.160 --> 57:38.412
Lloyd George and me.

57:38.580 --> 57:41.791
- Just the three of us.
- [chuckles]

57:43.001 --> 57:45.586
I said I didn't want any big fuss...

57:45.754 --> 57:48.381
- No.
- ...but they insisted.

57:48.548 --> 57:52.093
Lovely little article in The Telegraph.

57:53.762 --> 57:56.973
"The Woman Who Changed
the Face of History."

57:57.140 --> 57:58.891
Huh...

58:03.397 --> 58:06.899
[man] Less than two years ago,

58:07.067 --> 58:09.568
the Prime Minister quoted St. Francis...

58:09.736 --> 58:11.862
[laughter]

58:12.030 --> 58:15.825
Yes, and talked about bringing faith,

58:15.993 --> 58:19.745
- hope, and harmony to this country.
- [loud arguing]

58:19.913 --> 58:22.581
Mm... Denis?

58:24.126 --> 58:25.501
[whimpers]

58:30.215 --> 58:32.341
- [glass shattering]
- [angry shouting]

58:32.509 --> 58:34.593
[loud arguing]

58:34.761 --> 58:37.722
Can the Right Honorable Lady deny

58:37.889 --> 58:43.185
that having brought about the highest
level of unemployment since 1934...

58:43.353 --> 58:47.064
- [arguing]
- ...the biggest fall in total output

58:47.232 --> 58:50.818
in steel and coal production
in one year since 1931 ...

58:50.986 --> 58:52.737
[loud arguing]

58:52.904 --> 58:57.616
...and the biggest collapse
in industrial production since 1921?!

58:57.784 --> 59:00.286
- [clamoring]
- Order! Order!

59:02.247 --> 59:07.293
Can she also accept
that her free-market economics,

59:07.461 --> 59:10.337
designed to create
a growing middle class,

59:10.505 --> 59:16.052
ensures that the rich get richer
and the poor are irrelevant?!

59:16.219 --> 59:18.596
[protesters] Out! Out! Out!
Maggie! Maggie! Maggie!

59:18.764 --> 59:21.265
- Out! Out! Out!
- Look at me!

59:21.433 --> 59:24.351
Look at me!
You're supposed to be a mother!

59:24.519 --> 59:26.687
You're not a mother,
you're a monster!

59:26.855 --> 59:29.315
[echoing] You're a monster!

59:29.483 --> 59:30.858
[man] May we have a word,
Prime Minister?

59:31.026 --> 59:34.445
Yes, but in order
to arrive at the palace on time,

59:34.613 --> 59:37.573
Geoffrey and I are will be walking out
of that door in 15 minutes.

59:37.741 --> 59:39.450
- As you can see...
- I know you're running late, Margaret,

59:39.618 --> 59:41.368
but we have to address
this situation

59:41.536 --> 59:43.245
in the light of tomorrow's
blistering press coverage.

59:43.413 --> 59:45.122
Blistering! The knives are out.

59:45.290 --> 59:47.249
Your draft budget has
been leaked, Geoffrey.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.043
They are baying for our blood.

59:49.211 --> 59:53.464
Michael, we can't possibly buckle
at the first sign of difficulty.

59:53.632 --> 59:55.883
- No one is saying we have to buckle.
- But is this really the time

59:56.051 --> 59:57.551
to be making these spending cuts

59:57.719 --> 59:59.637
in the middle of one
of the deepest recessions

59:59.805 --> 01:00:01.680
this country has ever experienced?

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:05.309
- We need a plan of action, Margaret.
- Absolutely. A strategy.

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:07.645
- We must be armed.
- Agreed.

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:10.022
There's a perception, Margaret,
rightly or wrongly,

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.399
that we are now completely
out of touch with the country.

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:15.861
Really.
How much is a pack of Lurpak?

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:19.073
- Lurpak?
- [Margaret] Butter, Francis.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:23.202
Forty-two pence.
Anchor butter is 40 pence.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:26.664
Flora margarine,
still the cheapest, at 38p.

01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:30.417
I can assure you
I am not out of touch.

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.503
[hushed] Grocer's daughter. [chuckles]

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:35.881
- [girls giggling]
- Sorry. I didn't hear you.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.217
- What did you say?
- Nothing, Prime Minister. Nothing.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:41.220
No, no, please.
Don't try to hide you opinions.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:45.975
Goodness me, I'd much rather you were
open and straightforward about them,

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:51.188
instead of continuously and damagingly
leaking them to the press.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.944
Well?

01:00:57.112 --> 01:01:00.364
- Well...
- People can't pay their mortgages.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:02.783
The manufacturing industry
is practically on its knees.

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:06.287
Honest, hard-working, decent
people are losing their homes.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:08.205
- It's terribly shameful.
- The point is, Prime Minister,

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:10.040
we must moderate the pace...

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.209
If we even have a hope
of winning the next election.

01:01:12.377 --> 01:01:15.713
Ah. Worried about our careers, are we?

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:18.090
- Really.
- That's quite absurd.

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:22.344
[Margaret] Gentlemen, if we don't cut
spending, we will be bankrupt.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:25.014
Yes, the medicine is harsh,

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:29.685
but the patient requires it
in order to live.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.021
Should we withhold the medicine?

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:35.691
No. We are not wrong.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:39.945
We did not seek election
and win in order to manage

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.573
the decline of a great nation.

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:46.202
The people of this country
chose us because they believe

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:49.288
we can restore the health
of the British economy,

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.540
and we will do just that.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:55.127
Barring a failure of nerve.

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:58.172
Anything else?

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.049
- Prime Minister.
- Prime Minister.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:05.512
You have saved the day once again,
Crawfie. You're an angel.

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:09.934
You can't just
close down a conversation

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.727
because it's not
what you wish to hear.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:15.814
Oh, Geoffrey, I don't expect everyone
to just sit there and agree with me.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:18.817
But what kind of leader am I
if I don't try to get my own way,

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.487
do what I know to be right?

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:23.697
Yes. But, Margaret...

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:30.871
...one must be careful not to test
one's colleagues' loyalties too far.

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:33.958
[men murmuring]

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:40.339
[angry shouting]

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:49.556
[newscaster]
We are now one split nation,

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:54.478
with a huge gulf dividing
the employed from the unemployed.

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:59.733
[man] The Thatcher plan is
to break the Trade Union Movement.

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:03.028
[Margaret] There must be closures
of uneconomic coal mines.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:06.657
We seek only an efficient industry.

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:11.120
[woman] The miners are being starved
back to work, the need is desperate!

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.124
[whistle blowing]

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:26.552
[Margaret] There are those
who would say hold back,

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.722
there are those
who would make us retreat,

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:33.017
but we shall never give in to them.

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:37.855
We shall never waver, not for a second,

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:42.943
in our determination to see
this country prosper once again.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:51.702
[chanting]

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:55.331
[newscaster] A car bomb has exploded
outside Harrods department store,

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.708
killing six people and injuring 71.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:00.794
[newscaster 2] Eleven soldiers died
today when two bombs were detonated

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:03.922
during military parades
in Hyde Park and Regent's Park.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.300
Seven horses also died in the blast.

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.719
[newscaster 3]
The IRA have claimed responsibility.

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.516
- [siren wails]
- [shouting]

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:20.189
- [gunfire]
- [applause]

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:25.235
And now,
it must be business as usual.

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:38.207
[Denis] Come on, love, come to bed.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.459
I don't know why you do this
to yourself every year.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:43.295
It's a speech at conference,
not the Magna Carta.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:46.006
[Margaret reciting quietly]

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:48.384
[Denis] Time to call it a day, darling.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.719
It's ten to three, for God's sake.

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.180
[Margaret] Oh, I know, I'm coming, DT.

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:54.932
- Come on...
- Nearly there.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:06.777
[gasps]

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:08.404
[Margaret wheezes] Denis!

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.949
- [debris clattering]
- [metal groaning]

01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:13.409
Denis!

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.744
[coughing]

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:21.166
Oh, there you are.
Are you all right?

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:24.086
[Margaret coughing]

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:29.007
[wheezing] My shoes!

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:31.844
[sirens wailing]

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:40.644
[Margaret] That's
when I thought I'd lost you.

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:45.399
[phone rings]

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:47.192
[moans]

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.239
Mark?

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:55.534
Hello, darling.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.456
Oh... No. No, I'm fine.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.749
I... I'm very well.

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:05.586
How... How is, uh...

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.839
...Sarah?

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:11.008
Yes, and the children?

01:06:14.262 --> 01:06:15.762
Oh.

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:19.850
Oh, you can't.

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.728
That's a pity.

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:28.484
Well, I was hoping to see you.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.030
Yes. Oh, no, that's fine.

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:36.200
Really, darling. That's fine.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:41.413
Of course. Another time.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:43.332
Yes, darling.

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:48.670
Yes. I can't wait. Lovely.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.341
Yes.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.428
Mark?

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.390
Mm...

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:05.145
Oh. Oh, dear.

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:13.445
[sighs]

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:18.742
["I Whistle a Happy Tune"
from the King and I playing]

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:24.498
That was Mark.

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.416
Not able to come.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:28.710
[Denis] That boy's always going AWOL.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:32.631
Well, it costs him a great deal
to fly everyone up here.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:37.761
There you go, making excuses for him.
Now look where it's got you.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:41.473
Did you know that Yul Brynner
was a gypsy from Vladivostok?

01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:46.103
Yes. Yes, he moved
to Paris when he was 14.

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:49.273
And he played the King of Siam

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.276
4,625 times

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:55.737
on the London and Broadway stages.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:00.951
- What are you doing?
- One likes to make an effort.

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:05.080
- A snifter?
- You're dead, Denis.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:08.917
- Well, if I'm dead, who you talking to?
- ["Shall We Dance" playing]

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.420
- Shall we dance?
- Oh.

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:15.007
[music continuing]

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:34.151
[Margaret giggling]

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:42.743
Oh! [chuckles]

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:45.245
[laughing]

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:48.290
[distant rumbling]

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.250
[panting]

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:52.377
- [bell tolling]
- [newscaster] The Falkland Islands,

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.171
the British colony
in the South Atlantic, has fallen.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.799
Argentina claims its marines
went ashore

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:00.469
as a spearhead this morning
to capture key targets,

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:03.095
including the capital, Port Stanley.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:09.102
Gentlemen, the Argentinean junta,
which is a fascist gang,

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:13.482
has invaded our sovereign territory.
This cannot be tolerated.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.444
May I make plain
my negotiating position:

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:22.448
I will not negotiate
with criminals or thugs.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:25.827
The Falkland Islands
belong to Britain,

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.372
and I want them back.

01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:33.542
Gentlemen, I need you to tell me today
if that is possible.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.837
Possible... just, Prime Minister.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:38.506
We can have a task force ready
to sail in 48 hours.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.551
- Forty-eight hours. But?
- But...

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:43.386
We have a very narrow weather window.

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:46.264
We can't fight in winter down there,
nobody can.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:50.685
If we are going, we have to go now.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:58.985
Why were the islands left
without any naval protection?

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:00.946
[man] In the last round of defense cuts,

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:04.032
we judged the risk of invasion
to be small.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.785
- [Margaret] Did we?
- And if you remember, Prime Minister,

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:09.996
you agreed that we should reduce
the naval presence in the area

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:12.874
to an absolute minimum.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:22.050
Margaret, the cost of sending 28,000 men
and a hundred ships 12,000 miles,

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.553
almost to Argentina,
will be absolutely crippling.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:28.098
I don't think we should be worrying
about money at this point, Geoffrey.

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:29.766
We can't afford to go to war.

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:32.519
[officer's voice echoing]
We have to go now.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.439
[echoes] Now.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.943
[Margaret] The government
has now decided

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:43.029
that a large task force will sail,

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:47.659
as soon as all preparations
are complete.

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:50.287
- [voices exclaiming]
- [man] Prime Minister,

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:53.540
we do still have three weeks
before our ships reach the islands.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:55.459
[man 2] All we're saying is
that we shouldn't give up

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.669
on trying to find a diplomatic solution.

01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:02.090
[man] The US Secretary of State
has arrived, Prime Minister.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:07.137
[man] So you are proposing
to go to war over these islands.

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:11.308
They are thousands of miles away,
a handful of citizens,

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:14.728
politically and economically
insignificant, if you'll excuse me.

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:18.440
Just like Hawaii... I imagine.

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:23.320
- I'm sorry?
- 1941,

01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:26.531
when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:28.867
Did America go, cap in hand,

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:32.078
and ask Tojo for a peaceful
negotiation of terms?

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.291
Did she turn her back
on her own citizens there

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:39.127
because the islands were thousands
of miles away

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.796
from the mainland United States?

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:44.633
No! No! No!

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:48.970
We will stand on principle,
or we will not stand at all.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:53.433
But, Margaret, with all due respect,
when one has been to war...

01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:56.228
With all due respect, sir,

01:11:56.395 --> 01:12:00.357
I have done battle
every single day of my life,

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:03.318
and many men have
underestimated me before.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.988
This lot seem bound to do the same,

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:10.033
but they will rue the day.

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:14.538
Now, shall I be mother?

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:20.418
Tea, Al, how do you take your tea?
Black or white?

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:23.046
[indistinct chattering]

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:35.350
The Argentinean ship
the General Belgrano and her escorts

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:39.271
are pursuing course 273 degrees
towards the Argentinean mainland.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:41.731
We are tracking them
with our submarine HMS Conqueror.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:44.234
Is this ship a threat?

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:48.113
[man] Both of these ships are carrying
Exocet missiles, Prime Minister.

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:51.741
Just yesterday,
they launched, then aborted,

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:54.369
an attack inside the exclusion zone.

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.162
There is a risk they could try it again.

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.999
The Belgrano is sailing
directly away from the islands.

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:01.042
Can it really be regarded
as a threat?

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.545
She's been changing course continually.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.381
There's a strong possibility
that they'll attempt a pincer movement

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:08.258
on our carrier group.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:11.344
I advise that we engage them.

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:15.599
Hit the Belgrano as a warning to the
others, send them all back to port.

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:18.810
It'll play badly internationally.
We'll be seen as aggressors.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:21.396
This will be an escalation,
Prime Minister.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:25.108
If there is to be an escalation,
it's better that we start it.

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:28.361
It is steaming away, Prime Minister.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.250
[Margaret] Sink it.

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.936
[newscaster] HMS Sheffield,
a Type 42 destroyer,

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.898
was attacked and hit late this afternoon
by an Argentine missile.

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:09.069
It is seen as retaliation
for the sinking of the General Belgrano,

01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:11.279
in which over 300
Argentinean sailors died.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:16.910
Prime Minister. The latest casualty
figures from the Sheffield.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:20.038
- [newscast continues indistinctly]
- I must write to them.

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:22.791
Prime Minister?

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.796
The families.

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:32.217
I must write to them.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:35.261
[newscaster]
A Type 21 frigate, HMS Ardent,

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:37.806
was hit by bombs and rockets.

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:40.642
[newscaster 2] Antelope went the way
of the other two British ships

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.186
- lost so far...
- Foreign Secretary.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:47.857
I've just been briefed by Admiral
Fieldhouse. He told me, bluntly,

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:51.653
that if the Argentineans are prepared
and willing to risk their aircraft,

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:55.198
they have enough Exocet missiles
to cripple most of our fleet.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:01.496
President Reagan and President Belaunde
of Peru have some new proposals...

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.873
...new proposals for the peace plan.

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:07.502
Peace plan?
There will be no appeasement.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:11.506
This is a war.
It's a war they started,

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.800
but by God, we will finish it.

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:18.346
Shall I tell you
what I'm going to write

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:23.309
to every single one of these families,
these heartbroken families?

01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:24.811
I'm going to tell them

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:30.900
that no British soldier will die
in vain... for the Falklands.

01:15:31.068 --> 01:15:36.948
[man] Lieutenant Colonel Jones.
Captain Wood. Captain Dench.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:41.536
[Margaret] As the only Prime Minister
in the history of our country

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:46.207
who is also a mother
with a son of my own,

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:50.962
I can imagine your agony,
and your grief.

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:54.883
[man] Prime Minister,
we have secured the beachhead.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:58.303
[newscaster] The Argentinean troops are
demoralized and ill-equipped.

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:01.181
[newscaster 2]
The paratroops have taken Goose Green.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.642
[newscaster]
Shortly after dark last night,

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:09.022
our forces surrounding Port Stanley
carried out what the Commander in Chief

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:13.109
has described
as a brilliant surprise night attack.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:19.324
- [rapid gunfire]
- [helicopter whirring]

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:20.742
- [gunfire over radio]
- [radio clicks off]

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:23.745
Thatcher, bed.

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:26.456
[newscaster] From their new
positions, our forces can see

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:29.375
large numbers
of Argentine soldiers retreating

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:31.795
and streaming back into Port Stanley.

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:35.840
Our forces are moving forward
to exploit their success.

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:39.552
[cheering]

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.264
[band playing "Soldiers of the Queen"]

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:47.185
[sobbing]

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:52.107
[laughing]

01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:58.571
- Well done, Margaret.
- Congratulations.

01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:02.242
[Margaret] We congratulate
the men and women

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:06.204
of our armed forces
for their skill, bravery,

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:08.832
and loyalty to this country.

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:14.254
We were faced with an act
of unprovoked aggression,

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:19.759
and we responded
as we have responded in times past:

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:23.471
with unity, strength, and courage...

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:26.015
- [uttering agreement]
- ...sure in the knowledge

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:30.353
that though much is sacrificed,

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:34.607
in the end,
right will prevail over wrong.

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:37.777
[all] Hear, hear!

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:41.573
And I put it to the Right
Honorable Gentleman opposite

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.617
that this is not a day for him to carp,

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:48.329
find fault, demand inquiries.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:52.500
They will happen,
I can assure him of that,

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.919
for we have nothing to hide.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:58.506
No. This is a day

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.843
to put differences aside,

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:05.346
to hold one's head high

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.224
and take pride in being British.

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.852
[all] Hear, hear!

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.735
Well done, Prime Minister.

01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:21.446
[cheering continuing]

01:18:31.081 --> 01:18:32.457
[tooting loudly]

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:35.043
Gotcha!
Well, that paid off, old girl!

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:36.711
Your ratings have soared,

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:41.341
from the most hated Prime Minister
of all time to the nation's darling.

01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:46.304
The world at your feet,
and Britain was back in business.

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:49.474
[â™ª Notsensibles: "I'm in Love
with Margaret Thatcher"]

01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:04.197
[lively chattering]

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:07.116
[song continuing]

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:17.835
[newscaster] The Berlin Wall has
fallen. The gates have been opened!

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:20.546
The police are making no attempt...
[continues indistinctly]

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:27.845
I don't agree.
I don't agree in any measure.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:31.683
Prime Minister, the question of the
European single currency will come up.

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:33.768
I don't think the country is
ready for it yet.

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:35.812
[Geoffrey] But we cannot bury
our heads in the sand...

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.564
[newscaster] A lot of Conservative
MP's and Ministers are saying

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:41.192
that there must be a change
in that style of management,

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.362
that Mrs. Thatcher must listen more,
and on occasion, give in.

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:45.989
[man] The point is, Prime Minister,

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:48.449
I don't think we can sell
the idea of a tax

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.868
that asks everyone
to pay the same.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:52.787
[Margaret] Our policies
may be unpopular,

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.580
but they are the right policies.

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:58.459
[man] Prime Minister, I just don't think
we can ask the poorest of the poor

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:01.379
to pay the same amount of tax
as a multi-millionaire.

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:03.840
There you go again! Why not?

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:07.135
- Because...
- Because people, on the whole,

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:09.762
think that the tax
is manifestly unfair.

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:12.557
Nonsense. Errant nonsense.

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:14.517
This is a simple proposition.

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:18.146
If you live in this country,
you must pay for the privilege.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:21.733
Something, anything.
If you pay nothing, you care nothing.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:25.194
What do you care
where you throw your rubbish?

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:28.990
Your council estate is a mess,
your town, graffiti, what do you care?

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.492
It's not your problem,
it's somebody else's problem.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.287
It's the government's problem.

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:39.334
Your problem, some of you,

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:42.587
is that you haven't got
the courage for this fight.

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:45.506
No, you haven't had
to fight hard for anything.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:49.302
It's all been given to you,
and you feel guilty about it.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:53.473
Well, may I say, on behalf of those
who have had to fight their way up,

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.226
and who don't feel guilty about it,

01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:00.813
we resent those slackers
who take, take, take,

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:03.066
and contribute nothing
to the community.

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:07.070
And I see the same thing,
the same cowardice

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:10.406
in our fight within the European Union,
cowardice,

01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:15.328
for the sovereignty of Britain,
the integrity of the pound!

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:18.581
Some of you... want to make concessions.

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:21.167
Some of you want to make concessions.

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:24.921
I hear, some of you,

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:28.674
agree with the latest French proposals.

01:21:28.842 --> 01:21:31.511
Well, why don't you get
on a boat to Calais? Hm?

01:21:31.678 --> 01:21:33.513
Why don't you put on a beret,

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.683
and pay 85 percent of your income
to the French government!

01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:49.487
Right.

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:52.448
What can we realistically hope
to achieve by the end of session,

01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:56.619
Lord President? And why have we not made
more progress to date?

01:21:56.787 --> 01:22:00.123
What is that?
Is that the timetable?

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:02.750
- I haven't seen that.
- It is, Prime Minister.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:05.962
- May I see it?
- Yes, yes, of course.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:14.971
The wording is sloppy here.

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:19.267
- And here.
- [chuckles]

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.394
- If you say so.
- I do say so.

01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:24.063
- It's merely a first draft.
- [laughs]

01:22:24.231 --> 01:22:29.193
This is ridiculous. There are
two "T's" in "committee."

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:33.364
Two "T's." Geoffrey,
this is shameful. Shameful!

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:41.372
I can't even rely on you...
for a simple timetable.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.540
Are you unwell?

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:47.628
Yes, you are unwell.

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:52.758
Give me your pencil.
Give it to me!

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:01.142
If this is the best you can do,
I had better send you to hospital,

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:04.729
and I shall do your job as well
as my own and everyone else's.

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:09.484
Gentlemen, as the Lord President has
chosen to come to Cabinet unprepared...

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:13.154
...I shall have to close the meeting.

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.241
[clears throat]

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.578
Good morning.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.830
[members muttering]

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:18.052
[crowd chanting] Can't pay! Won't pay!
Can't pay! Won't pay!

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:21.639
[rock music plays]

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.021
[angry shouting]

01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:54.297
Geoffrey.

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:56.591
My letter of resignation.

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:02.471
Our differences, I'm afraid,

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:05.850
cannot be reconciled.

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:20.781
[Geoffrey] I have done
what I believe to be right

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:24.368
for my party and my country.

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:29.498
The time has come for others to consider
their own response

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:33.669
to the tragic conflict of loyalties
with which I have myself wrestled...

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:36.464
[Minister] Geoffrey's speech
in the House of Commons was devastating.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:38.633
[Minister 2] He just couldn't take
any more of the bullying.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:39.884
[Minister 3]
He was almost inviting someone

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:42.803
to challenge her for leadership
of the party.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.305
[Minister 4] She behaved appallingly.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:47.600
I wouldn't have spoken
to my gamekeeper like that.

01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:52.313
[Minister 5]
I don't think she can survive this.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:56.233
I'm here to announce my decision
to put my name forward

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:58.653
as leader of the Conservative Party.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:02.907
I have nothing but admiration
for our Prime Minister,

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:08.329
Margaret Thatcher,
but I believe our party

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:11.999
and our country need a new leader.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:16.379
- [newscaster] It's extraordinary...
- I'm the Prime Minister.

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:20.049
...make it possible
for Conservative MPs to depose

01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:21.842
- a sitting Prime Minister.
- Sweetie.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.928
He already has open support.

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:26.847
As Conservative MPs gather
in Westminster to decide

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:29.058
who they will back
in the leadership contest,

01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:31.018
the Prime Minister said
she would not be diverted

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:33.479
from critical international affairs.

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:37.525
Tonight in Paris, Mrs. Thatcher
is among 34 world leaders

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:40.653
who came here to celebrate
the end of the Cold War

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:46.283
and to herald the start of a peaceful
new age of East-West cooperation.

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:48.327
There's a general feeling
that Mrs. Thatcher

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:50.246
is going to win on the first ballot.

01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:52.081
"We're going to put it
to bed tomorrow night,"

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:54.166
is how one of her
campaign staff puts it.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:27:00.715
[Denis over phone] M, I think you should
come home and defend yourself, old girl.

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:03.384
Heseltine is campaigning ferociously.

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:05.052
[Margaret over phone] I do think
my time is better spent

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.513
seeing an end to the Cold War.
Don't you?

01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:11.434
After all this time,
they know what I stand for.

01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:15.646
Will she, or will she not,
be in the job tomorrow?

01:27:15.814 --> 01:27:19.942
- [overlapping newscasts]
- [man] Margaret, they can't touch you.

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:23.195
[lively chattering]

01:27:25.282 --> 01:27:27.742
[newscaster] Mrs. Thatcher
has failed to win enough votes

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:30.786
to secure an outright win
in the leadership contest

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:35.207
and must now decide whether to put her
name forward for the second round.

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:38.753
[newscaster 2] As Mrs. Thatcher
leaves Paris for London to make

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:42.256
her last-ditch attempt to pull together
support for her leadership,

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:44.842
the ship may have sailed.

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:46.927
[laughter]

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:49.221
[Margaret] Treachery!

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:52.850
[Minister 1] We will never win another
election led by that woman.

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:54.602
[Minister 2]
We need a leader who listens.

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:56.645
[Minister 3] This isn't about her,
it's about the party.

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:58.773
[Minister 4]
One must know when to go.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:02.234
[Minister 5] The question is,
how does anyone put it to her?

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:06.071
If you were to stand, I, of course,
would vote for you, Prime Minister.

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:08.616
Prime Minister, I, of course,
would vote for you...

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:11.911
But I don't think you can win.
The loyalty of all of my colleagues...

01:28:12.078 --> 01:28:14.288
It was the people who put me here.

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:18.167
The loyalty of all of my colleagues
cannot be counted upon.

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:21.504
It's up to them to tell me when to go.

01:28:21.671 --> 01:28:25.549
Margaret, you can't
let them do this to you.

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:28.969
Please, boss.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:31.514
They'll destroy you.

01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:34.016
Throw in the towel now, love.

01:28:35.477 --> 01:28:38.979
Don't let those bastards
see you humiliated.

01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:44.568
You just won't win, darling.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:46.445
Not this time.

01:28:47.906 --> 01:28:51.116
- [sniffles]
- Oh, Denis.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.705
I am the Prime Minister.

01:28:56.873 --> 01:28:59.708
- [loud arguing]
- [Speaker] Order! Order!

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:02.211
[Margaret] The Right Honorable
Gentleman is afraid.

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:04.713
[man] This is their naked
strategy of closing

01:29:04.881 --> 01:29:06.715
some coal mines and then selling off...

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:09.677
[Margaret] They believe in striking,
I believe in working!

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:12.513
[man] This is the woman who's
watched ten men on hunger strike

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:15.140
starve themselves to death
and never flinched!

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:17.351
[Margaret] Despicable and cowardly.

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:20.479
- [man] Cynical Falklands war...
- [man 2] More homeowners,

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:24.316
- more shareowners, more savings...
- [man 3] Showing to the bankers...

01:29:24.484 --> 01:29:28.404
- [overlapping speakers]
- [loud arguing]

01:29:28.572 --> 01:29:31.615
- [Margaret] Yes, yes, yes!
- [arguing continuing]

01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:34.285
I offer my resignation

01:29:34.452 --> 01:29:38.539
after 11 and a half
extraordinary years...

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:42.459
...proud to have left Britain
in a much better state

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.336
than when we took office.

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:46.964
[woman singing "Casta Diva"]

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.347
[Margaret] What's this then?

01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:00.519
A radio.

01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:03.272
How useful.

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:06.025
[opera continuing]

01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:51.403
Steady, MT.

01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:53.697
[opera continuing]

01:30:58.662 --> 01:31:01.288
- [reporters clamoring]
- [man] Mrs. Thatcher!

01:31:03.375 --> 01:31:04.959
[clamoring fades]

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:09.338
[Denis] The greatest
Prime Minister since Churchill

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:12.466
deposed by a bunch
of spineless pygmies!

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:16.929
[Margaret] All those years
of taking the tough decisions.

01:31:17.097 --> 01:31:18.847
Does any of it matter now?

01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:20.474
[Denis] It's all been turned to mush!

01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:23.102
- Hm?
- By these fools!

01:31:23.269 --> 01:31:25.562
These lily-livered pinkos!

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:27.898
- These inept placaters.
- [laughs]

01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:30.025
Very good! These vacillators.

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:34.321
- Vacillators! Poll takers.
- Popularity seekers.

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:37.032
[Margaret] So busy taking
the pulse of the public!

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:40.703
- Weak! Weak! Weak!
- These weak, weak...

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:43.038
- All of them, weak!
- ...weak men!

01:31:46.126 --> 01:31:49.795
Don't they know
if you take the tough decisions...

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:53.966
...yes, people will hate you today,

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:56.301
but they'll thank you for generations.

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:59.763
Or forget you entirely
and chuck you out with the rubbish.

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:17.114
Oh!

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:23.162
[Margaret] All I wanted was
to make a difference in the world.

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:26.874
[Denis] And you did, love, you did.

01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:33.380
Yes... Oh...

01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:38.927
[Margaret] All I wanted was for my
children to grow up well and be happy,

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:41.388
happier than I was, certainly.

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:43.474
[laughs]

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:49.438
He kept all this.

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:54.943
[chuckles] Oh, yes.

01:32:55.111 --> 01:32:57.112
[laughs]

01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:00.365
[Margaret] And I wanted you
to be happy, of course.

01:33:00.533 --> 01:33:02.743
Were you happy, Denis?

01:33:06.915 --> 01:33:09.083
[softly] Tell me the truth.

01:33:29.979 --> 01:33:33.315
[frenetic orchestral music plays]

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:36.211
Denis?

01:34:39.465 --> 01:34:41.383
Here's your bag.

01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:44.094
All packed, sorted.

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:07.492
Denis, wait.

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:10.537
Where are your shoes?

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:14.291
You... You can't go without your shoes.

01:35:16.502 --> 01:35:19.379
- Not yet.
- Steady.

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:23.008
Yes. Steady.

01:35:23.176 --> 01:35:25.385
- Steady the buffs.
- Steady the buffs.

01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:29.723
No. Not yet!

01:35:29.891 --> 01:35:33.894
Denis! Wait!

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:38.315
I don't...
I said I don't want you to go yet.

01:35:39.317 --> 01:35:41.276
Denis! Please!

01:35:41.444 --> 01:35:45.072
Not... Don't... No.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:47.407
I'm not...

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:50.744
I don't want to be on my own.

01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:53.580
[Denis] You're gonna be fine
on your own, love.

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:56.208
You always have been.

01:35:57.794 --> 01:36:00.587
[Margaret gasping] Denis...

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:05.300
[gasping] No, no, no!

01:36:21.567 --> 01:36:24.444
[whimpers]

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:38.458
- [knocking]
- [Carol] Mummy.

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.419
- [groans]
- Good God!

01:36:40.586 --> 01:36:43.380
- Mum, are you all right?
- Yes.

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:46.425
- What have you been doing?
- [groaning]

01:36:46.592 --> 01:36:51.013
Mummy, you should have called
for help, silly old sausage.

01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:54.057
Have you not even been in your bed
properly? You've done all this?

01:36:54.225 --> 01:36:57.769
Yes, it's all sorted. Finished.

01:36:57.937 --> 01:37:00.772
Yes, well, don't worry about that.
June and I can crack on with it.

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:04.109
I was just going to get dressed.

01:37:04.277 --> 01:37:08.280
Shall I call someone,
see if anyone can come and do your hair?

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:12.701
No... You do it.

01:37:17.457 --> 01:37:21.043
[Carol] Right, I'm off, June.
Susie's going to drive me.

01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:24.880
- Just loading the car.
- [June] OK. Bye!

01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:37.309
Oh, let me do that, Margaret.

01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:41.438
No, dear, it's all right. I'll do it.

01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:44.274
[June] Carol said you might go
to the House of Lords today?

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:49.738
- No, no. I'm not going anywhere.
- [water running]

01:37:49.906 --> 01:37:51.907
[children shouting playfully]

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:04.711
[engine puttering]

01:38:09.509 --> 01:38:12.260
[birds singing]

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.277
[clears throat]

[piano playing classical prelude]
