WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:03.719
Closing up!

00:05.130 --> 00:07.223
Tell your folks to start
feeding you again, Will.

00:07.298 --> 00:08.484
It's your last free meal.

00:08.508 --> 00:09.809
Joe fired me today.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.404
Said there were
only four days left

00:11.428 --> 00:13.531
to the only summer before the
only senior year I'd ever have,

00:13.555 --> 00:14.865
and I should enjoy myself.

00:14.889 --> 00:16.065
That bastard!

00:16.181 --> 00:17.159
Well, you show him.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.661
Don't you enjoy a single minute.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.287
Can I help refill the
salt shakers, Bay?

00:20.311 --> 00:22.623
Claudia, I thought someone
drove you home hours ago.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.792
Obviously not. So can I help?

00:24.816 --> 00:26.377
No. Go bug someone else.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.536
Bailey, are you
working or gabbing?

00:28.695 --> 00:30.079
Go bug Julia.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.497
So, tomorrow, huh?

00:32.531 --> 00:34.468
God! I can't think of
anything more romantic

00:34.492 --> 00:37.555
than a woman waiting for her
man to return from overseas.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.056
Sarah, he's not
coming back from war.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.850
- He's coming back
from summer vacation.

00:40.874 --> 00:41.892
Charlie, what is this?

00:41.916 --> 00:43.509
I'm picking a band
for the wedding.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.678
- Pick again.
- Pick again.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.064
Aren't you just
dying to see him?

00:47.088 --> 00:48.848
I mean, you know, he'll
probably have an accent.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.151
He'll probably say...

00:50.175 --> 00:52.194
"Hello, darling.
It's me, Justin."

00:52.218 --> 00:53.154
Jule!

00:53.178 --> 00:55.031
Claudia, hasn't anyone
taken you home yet?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.231
God! Aren't you just
dying to see him?

00:59.267 --> 01:00.568
The Shecky Wasserman Band.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.780
Care for a hora, Bailey?

01:04.272 --> 01:05.447
Pass.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.959
You know what. That
would be great

01:06.983 --> 01:07.877
for the bonfire.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.794
We could blast it

01:08.818 --> 01:10.296
and dance in a circle
around the flame.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.422
It would be kind of pagan.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.705
What do you say?

01:13.156 --> 01:15.708
Oh. I forgot. You're not
going to the bonfire.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.094
What?

01:17.118 --> 01:18.012
Ah, I'm not in the mood.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.680
Sure, forget that it's
practically an end-of-summer,

01:19.704 --> 01:21.807
last-night-before-school
tradition.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.341
Two years is not a tradition.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.352
But if you had
somebody to go with...

01:25.376 --> 01:26.353
Will.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.230
What about the hot dogs
and the illegal beer

01:28.254 --> 01:29.440
and the marshmallows and...

01:29.464 --> 01:30.681
Hey!

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.358 --> 01:50.410
Of course there's gonna
be some slow tunes.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.161
Some Sinatra, okay?

01:52.403 --> 01:54.038
I am too writing this down.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.541
Mom...

01:57.117 --> 01:58.918
Mom, I gotta go.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.629
Mom, I mean it.
Someone's at the door.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.849
No, I'm not using
it as an excuse

02:03.873 --> 02:05.466
to get you off the phone.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.553
Oh, I love you too, Mom.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.931
Occasionally, I'd like to murder
you, but I'm hoping that will pass.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.474
Coming.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.727
Oh. Hi.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.280
Hello.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.157
Does Charlie Salinger
still live here?

02:20.181 --> 02:22.817
Yeah, he does. Can I
help you with something?

02:22.851 --> 02:25.913
Um... I need to talk to him.

02:25.937 --> 02:26.914
Is he home?

02:26.938 --> 02:30.032
No. He's, um... He's working
tonight at his dad's place.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.378
- Is there something...
- Oh, no. No.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.328
That's okay. It's just...

02:34.946 --> 02:36.789
Could you maybe tell
him I stopped by?

02:37.740 --> 02:38.916
Sure.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.501
Uh...

02:41.035 --> 02:42.795
knowing your name might
make that easier.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.682
Oh! Right.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.923
Sure.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.967
I'm Pamela... Rush.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.814
Charlie and I were, um... friends

02:51.838 --> 02:53.055
a while back.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.143
So do you want to leave
a number or something?

02:57.510 --> 02:58.769
No, that's okay.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.105
Well, is there a message?

03:02.557 --> 03:04.358
I'll just be in touch.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.153
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.529
Really.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.286
No trouble at all.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.922
<i>♪ Everybody wants to live ♪</i>

03:25.997 --> 03:27.766

03:54.442 --> 03:57.546
So... this bonfire
thing sounds cool.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.913
I... I've never been to one.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.466
Is it, like, a couple thing,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.416
or do people just kind
of go on their own?

04:02.951 --> 04:04.345
Why, you thinking of
bringing someone?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.420
Oh... Maybe.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.265
Well, if you do,

04:08.289 --> 04:10.184
tell him not to bring any
booze down to the beach,

04:10.208 --> 04:11.936
the last year the cops showed up

04:11.960 --> 04:13.469
and made this huge stink.

04:13.628 --> 04:14.929
Oh, right.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.940
Ah, I'll probably
go alone, anyway.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.933
I like doing that
sometimes, you know.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.976
Going to these things by myself.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.603
Yeah. Solo's cool.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.980
Totally.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.315
I think being alone
gets a bad rap.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.858
God, you are so right.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.070
So, um...

04:31.312 --> 04:32.989
maybe we could go
alone together.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.285
What?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.337
You're funny.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.296
I am?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.881
Yeah, the way you say things.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.290
"Go alone together."

04:47.412 --> 04:50.381
What? Do I have
something on my face?

04:51.249 --> 04:52.466
We're here.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.218
Oh.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.887
Well, thanks for the lift.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.440
Thanks for all the
lifts this summer.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.599
Sure.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.687
Oh, hey. You got to...

05:05.305 --> 05:06.647
jiggle it.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.861
There you go.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.571
Thanks.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.167
Good night.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.534
Good night.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.415
Well, who is she? How
do you know her?

05:25.199 --> 05:26.542
How well do you know her?

05:27.452 --> 05:28.794
We were friends.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.714
What kind of friends?

05:32.957 --> 05:36.635
Charlie, have you or have you
not seen this woman naked?

05:37.045 --> 05:39.180
It so happens I have.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.890
What?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.276
Me and a hundred other guys.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.319
She was a figure model in
the fine arts department.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.978
When I was a
sophomore, I drew her.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.066
So you two didn't, like...

05:50.641 --> 05:51.859
have a thing?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.737
Oh, no. We had a thing.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.782
A real brief thing.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.241
It lasted...

06:00.735 --> 06:02.495
maybe a month, two.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.923
It was, what... four years ago.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.332
I haven't seen her since.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.011
Who knows why she stopped by.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.211
I don't.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.006
Pamela Rush.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.467
Huh.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.975
I was thinking about
buying a bike.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.655
Well, you could probably
get a good discount.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.732
I mean, because you
work at a bike shop.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.027
No. A bike.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.654
A motorcycle.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.949
Oh.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.460
Well, you should.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.660
Cool.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.590
Yeah, there's some, uh,
trails up in the headlands

06:46.614 --> 06:48.165
not a lot of people know about.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.044
I've never been on a motorcycle.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.132
It's easy. All you got
to do is hold on.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.719
I'd probably throw you
completely off balance.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.849
You might. I could handle it.

07:12.473 --> 07:13.691
So, uh...

07:15.268 --> 07:16.620
you want to go
with me to look...

07:16.644 --> 07:17.987
you know, for bikes?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.072
Maybe tomorrow sometime?

07:22.275 --> 07:25.494
Uh, tomorrow, I can't.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.748
Whatever.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.637
Griffin, it's gonna
get harder, you know,

07:33.661 --> 07:34.795
to do this.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.630
To meet.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.885
Well, because of school starting
up again and everything.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.805
Yeah. I guess.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.640
I guess so.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.393
I guess things are gonna change.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.397
I'm kind of sorry about it.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.156
Do you know what those ones are there?
The pink ones?

08:05.568 --> 08:07.203
No, me neither.

08:08.696 --> 08:09.590
It's weird.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.883
All those times
sitting in a garden,

08:10.907 --> 08:12.666
I still don't know
what to call anything.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.342
How many times have you
seen this movie, Will?

08:21.375 --> 08:24.011
I keep discovering stuff
I hadn't noticed before.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.596
It's very rich in that way.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.858
It's a $100-million comic strip.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.099
What's your point?

08:30.009 --> 08:31.570
Let's go. Let's go
see something else.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.823
No! Um... no, no.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.034
I can't get mentally
prepared to see one movie

08:37.058 --> 08:38.984
and then just go see another.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.246
Hey!

08:41.270 --> 08:42.446
Hey, Will.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.083
Bay, you remember
my cousin, Sharon.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.084
Yeah, hi.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.202
- And this is...
- Holly.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.838
- I'm Holly.
- Hi.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.247
I've heard...

08:51.447 --> 08:53.707
almost nothing about you.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.335
Same here.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.753
So...

08:58.496 --> 09:00.432
So, you go to Grant, huh?

09:00.456 --> 09:01.757
Right.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.310
Right, I go to Grant. Let's see.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.261
Uh, I'm a senior.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.565
I... I'm applying to colleges.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.307
I have to take my SATs.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.945
Let's see. What else do you
have to know about me? I'm...

09:12.969 --> 09:14.311
Kind of rude.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.941
Look, I'm gonna go.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.661
Okay, I got some
stuff I have to do.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.111
You shouldn't have
done this to me.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.713
I'm sorry, we're closed. I
must have forgotten to lock...

09:31.737 --> 09:32.955
Charlie.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.457
Pamela.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.585
Hey!

09:38.953 --> 09:41.005
God, this is so weird
seeing you again.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.601
I mean, uh, Kirsten told
me that you stopped by.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.759
Is she your wife?

09:46.085 --> 09:47.062
Fiancee.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.597
Oh. That's nice, Charlie.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.764
Yeah.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.726
So, what's going on with you?

09:54.176 --> 09:56.312
I mean... you look great.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.031
Thanks.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.481
Yeah, I'm good.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.526
I'm okay.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.196
Not real great.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.282
You're getting worse.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.578
I have a problem.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.372
And I thought I could
take care of it myself,

10:15.740 --> 10:17.124
but I can't.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.595
And I'm sorry for
coming to you, but...

10:19.619 --> 10:21.253
No. Come on.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.005
Come on. It's...

10:30.588 --> 10:31.764
Wow.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.516
Wow, look at him.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.320
He's yours?

10:36.344 --> 10:38.479
Spencer. His name is Spencer.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.149
Spencer Salinger Rush.

10:45.227 --> 10:46.820
Huh. Uh...

10:47.772 --> 10:49.041
Don't take this the wrong way,

10:49.065 --> 10:52.993
but, um... I didn't think I
meant that much to you.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.454
You didn't.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.373
He's your son.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.627
Right.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.465
Come on.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.300
Give me a break.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.720
No.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.273
No.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.359
Oh, please don't get
angry, Charlie.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.059
I mean, I can explain.

11:17.301 --> 11:18.779
We weren't seeing
each other anymore,

11:18.803 --> 11:20.572
and I just didn't think
at the time that you'll...

11:20.596 --> 11:21.740
Get the hell out of here.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.315
- Charlie...
- There is no way.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.608
No way!

11:32.233 --> 11:33.450
Kirsten.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.505
You're kidding me.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.831
Well, I mean, it's that
time of year, but...

11:39.365 --> 11:40.342
we're getting through it.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.835
I mean, it's amazing.
We're really doing well.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.338
Look at him.

11:47.331 --> 11:48.266
He's so

11:48.290 --> 11:49.425
cute.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.846
Hey! Look who stopped by.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.099
Charlie.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.308
Pamela.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.061
Did you know anything
about this little boy?

12:01.220 --> 12:02.155
His name's Spencer.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.355
Isn't he adorable?

12:04.181 --> 12:05.399
Yeah, he is.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.079
Well, um...

12:09.103 --> 12:11.864
I'm gonna let you
two guys catch up.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.834
I hope I'll see you again.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.909
It would be really nice if Owen
had a friend to play with.

12:16.735 --> 12:17.754
Bye.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.037
See you.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.762
I thought maybe if you saw him,

12:25.786 --> 12:26.962
you would believe me.

12:28.622 --> 12:29.850
This is your son, Charlie.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.102
He is not... He is not my son.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.594
How can you be so sure?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.565
You and I did what it takes
to make one of these

12:36.589 --> 12:38.223
three or four times a day

12:38.299 --> 12:40.152
for two months solid, if
I remember correctly.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.478
Yeah. Four years ago.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.364
Usually, it's tradition
to let the father know

12:44.388 --> 12:46.199
when the little test
comes back positive,

12:46.223 --> 12:47.284
or the baptism,

12:47.308 --> 12:48.660
or the delivery or
the circumcision,

12:48.684 --> 12:50.235
or whatever the
hell it is you do!

12:50.478 --> 12:53.405
Oh, come on. Like you would have
been there for any of those things.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.450
And you would have told
me to get an abortion.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.161
And I didn't want an abortion.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.039
I wanted this baby.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.543
And I knew I couldn't
count on you.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.798
He's four years old.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.593
You and I broke up a little
over four and a half years ago.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.095
And there wasn't anybody else.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.265
Do the math, Charlie.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.144
God, I am getting
married in nine weeks.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.147
What do you want me to do?

13:27.973 --> 13:31.276
I am... I am not trying
to ruin your life.

13:33.687 --> 13:34.905
I'm in trouble.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.333
I got laid off

13:36.357 --> 13:38.575
from this secretarial
job that I had,

13:38.609 --> 13:41.453
and I still have
daycare to pay for.

13:41.737 --> 13:44.039
What is... Is this blackmail?
Is that what this is?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.417
God's sake, Charlie.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.712
I want you out of my house now.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.175
You are not gonna push me away.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.303
Use the back way out.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.890
I have got this little
boy to take care of.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.559
Use the back way.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.271
I'm not gonna go away.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.073
Do you think this stuff will
make me more attractive to men?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.210
Men? What men? You
don't know any men.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.410
You know boys.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.329
Oh. right. Good point by you.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.341
Thanks for cutting
through my question

14:26.365 --> 14:27.916
and finding a way to insult me.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.501
I'm sorry.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.638
It's just that, well, I'm
getting older now, you know.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.464
I mean, I'm practically
in junior high school.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.185
All these things like
makeup and stuff,

14:37.209 --> 14:39.386
well, they're gonna
be important to me.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.806
And I need someone
to look up to,

14:42.923 --> 14:44.433
and someone to answer
all my questions.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.486
Claud, I'm sorry.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.395
I should be more
sensitive, okay?

14:49.096 --> 14:50.272
Okay.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.191
So, what did you want to know?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.277
Can I go to the
bonfire with you?

14:55.352 --> 14:56.570
No.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.493
The point is, you
hurt her feelings.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.255
No, Will. No, that's
not the point.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.955
That's not even
remotely the point.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.676
The point is you had no right
ruining a perfectly good movie

15:09.700 --> 15:11.094
by springing some
stupid date on me.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.512
Oh, gee, how could
you ever forgive me?

15:12.536 --> 15:15.098
I merely get one of the cutest,
greatest, funniest, smartest girls

15:15.122 --> 15:16.308
I know to go out with you.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.602
Why don't you just hang me up by
my little fingers and shoot me?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.312
Ooh, what a miserable friend
I've turned out to be.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.721
I have better things to do.
Okay?

15:22.796 --> 15:24.649
I do. I haven't played
football in over a year.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.318
I'm way behind on my conditioning.
I have to do that.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.444
Right. Right.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.321
So you'd rather do bench
presses and squat thrusts

15:29.345 --> 15:31.355
than to make out with
Holly Blanchard?

15:31.430 --> 15:32.407
You need help, man.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.566
Yeah, but not from you. Goodbye.

15:35.684 --> 15:36.578
Come on, Bay.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.038
We both know what's
going on with you.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.196
Shut up, Will.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.156
Weren't you leaving?

15:41.523 --> 15:42.783
Coming.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.420
Hey, Justin!

15:45.444 --> 15:46.671
How you doing, man?
How was London?

15:46.695 --> 15:47.672
Great. Great.

15:47.696 --> 15:48.715
Cool. Come on in.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.633
Julia!

15:49.657 --> 15:51.259
This girl is great, Bay.
She's really great.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.460
- She could turn you around.
- I'm ignoring you.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.920
So, hey, man.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.306
So London was cool?

15:56.330 --> 15:58.799
I imagine if you're into
history, it would be very...

15:58.832 --> 16:00.101
- Historical.
- Yeah.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.102
Julia!

16:01.126 --> 16:04.356
Yeah. Yeah. Lots of old,
uh, tombs and stuff.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.597
Julia!

16:06.548 --> 16:07.609
Justin!

16:07.633 --> 16:10.227
Bay, Bay, come on.
Just give it a try.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.488
Why?

16:11.512 --> 16:12.822
- Bailey.
- What?

16:12.846 --> 16:15.482
What? What? Name one thing
that is so great about dating.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.990
All right, name two things.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.535
I did that too.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.673
What?

16:29.697 --> 16:31.591
Walked around with a
picture in my pocket

16:31.615 --> 16:32.801
for the first few years

16:32.825 --> 16:34.501
like I couldn't
believe I had a kid.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.837
You mind if I...

16:40.249 --> 16:42.718
He's got his dad's
eyes, that's for sure.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.971
You must hear that
all the time, right?

16:52.553 --> 16:54.864
I figured I need a female
opinion, you know?

16:54.888 --> 16:56.356
Yeah. I know. That's important.

16:56.765 --> 16:57.993
So you'll be honest?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.943
- I'll be honest.
- Okay.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.697
I really appreciate you
doing this for me.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.617
My pleasure.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.050
Uh, so what's this
all for, anyway?

17:14.074 --> 17:15.385
Some kind of big family thing?

17:15.409 --> 17:19.253
No. Actually... I
kind of have a date.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.548
- What?
- Yeah.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.592
Will kind of forced me into it.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.469
What's that supposed to mean?

17:25.502 --> 17:26.604
I don't know.

17:26.627 --> 17:29.181
He thinks it would be good for me.
He thinks I need it.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.350
What do you think? You
think it's stupid?

17:31.550 --> 17:33.018
Uh, I don't know.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.408
No.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.325
I guess not.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.151
I mean, what's the worst
thing that could happen?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.113
What do you think?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.997
That's Westminster Abbey.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.167
So, what exactly do you
mean by incredibly boring?

17:57.910 --> 17:58.887
That's me and Big Ben.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.846
You didn't do anything?

17:59.870 --> 18:01.755
You just worked in
the restaurant?

18:02.247 --> 18:03.391
That's Windsor Castle.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.633
Pretty much.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.430
That's me after my dad explained
the concept of blood sausage.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.443
So how is that possible

18:13.467 --> 18:15.602
to be gone so long
and miss so little?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.313
Any new couples at least?

18:19.723 --> 18:21.076
Trafalgar Square.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.359
Not especially.

18:23.018 --> 18:26.029
What's that, um,
there on your head?

18:26.063 --> 18:27.406
That's a pigeon.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.502
Everybody feeds pigeons
in Trafalgar Square.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.419
It's what you do.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.754
Ooh!

18:32.778 --> 18:34.830
And what's that there
on your shirt?

18:36.073 --> 18:38.051
Oh, my God! I have to
get a copy of this.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.177
- Yeah, right.
- No, I'm serious.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.136
Give me the negatives.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.388
No, no. Here, here. You
can keep this copy, okay?

18:42.412 --> 18:45.257
Are you kidding? I'm gonna get this
thing blown up, like, poster size.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.684
I... I'll make a copy for you.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.428
Why are there twice as many
negatives as there are pictures?

18:49.837 --> 18:50.772
Huh?

18:50.796 --> 18:52.148
Well, what did you do?

18:52.172 --> 18:54.224
Like, pull some of these
so I wouldn't see them?

18:54.258 --> 18:56.184
No, no. Not exactly.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.812
Who's this girl?

18:59.429 --> 19:00.647
Justin?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.065
She's no one.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.192
She's...

19:04.601 --> 19:06.486
Her name's Allison.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.706
She's a girl that I
met over there, uh.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.700
Her dad ran the lecture
series that my dad did.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.537
We just hung out. That's all.
We were friends.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.497
We were just friends, Julia.
That's it.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.958
And you did all these
things with her.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.226
I mean, that, that part where she
poured paint all over her body

19:28.250 --> 19:30.395
and rolled around
in all that flour,

19:30.419 --> 19:31.845
what was that about, huh?

19:32.421 --> 19:33.606
It's art?

19:33.630 --> 19:34.607
I hate to break it to you,

19:34.631 --> 19:35.817
but that, that is not art.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.018
I have seen art, and
that is not it.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.270
I spent the whole
night wondering

19:40.387 --> 19:43.273
if regular soap was gonna get
all that stuff off her body.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.985
Well, anyway, thanks
a lot for coming.

19:47.436 --> 19:50.030
I kind of had to show up.
Denise and I work together.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.323
Oh, yeah? Where?

19:51.565 --> 19:53.408
At this coffeehouse
in North Beach.

19:54.776 --> 19:57.579
Coffeehouse? Really? You
work at a coffeehouse?

19:57.821 --> 20:00.999
Trieste. On Grant.
Why, you know it?

20:02.075 --> 20:03.219
Uh, no.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.096
No, it's just...
a friend of mine

20:05.120 --> 20:08.215
used to work at a
coffeehouse in North Beach.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.050
You should come by sometime.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.385
This is me.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.762
Oh.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.098
Well, I had a nice time.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.017
So did I.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.436
- Maybe we should...
- So, we should...

20:22.763 --> 20:24.856
- You first.
- No, you go ahead.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.859
I was just gonna say that

20:28.227 --> 20:30.153
maybe we should do
this again sometime.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.739
Is that what you were gonna say?

20:33.774 --> 20:35.075
Yeah.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.035
Sure. That would be great.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.206
So...

20:42.741 --> 20:43.959
So...

20:47.412 --> 20:48.547
Anyway...

20:48.872 --> 20:50.173
Anyway...

20:55.045 --> 20:56.304
Well...

20:58.215 --> 20:59.391
good night.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.143
Good night.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.858
Forget it, mother.
That is so ugly.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.079
Charlie's right
here, mom, and...

21:11.103 --> 21:12.320
What is it, honey?

21:12.604 --> 21:13.822
Really? You do?

21:15.023 --> 21:17.627
Charlie's saying how much he
hates Garamond Bold, mom.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.119
Could you call her back?

21:19.361 --> 21:21.454
We want to go with something
much less formal.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.706
Please?

21:22.906 --> 21:23.800
Mom...

21:23.824 --> 21:25.959
Mom. Mom. I got
to call you back.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.461
I got to. Somebody's
at the door.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.255
I know. I know.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.685
I know you don't want to get
dragged into these arguments,

21:33.709 --> 21:35.677
but, at this point, she's
not even listening to me.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.598
Charlie?

21:40.549 --> 21:41.808
Here's the thing.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.270
What thing?

21:46.972 --> 21:48.773
The thing about Pamela and me.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.026
Why she's here. What she wants.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.155
Charlie?

21:59.234 --> 22:00.535
I love you.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.162
What?

22:02.529 --> 22:04.039
And I don't want to hurt you.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.083
Good.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.462
That's good, because... I
don't want to be hurt.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.466
Spencer, her little boy...

22:19.212 --> 22:20.722
She says he's mine, Kirsten.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.019
I think he's my son.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.662
Did you kiss her?

22:45.113 --> 22:46.174
No.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.425
Did you want to kiss her?

22:47.449 --> 22:48.750
No.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.013
Did you maybe want to
decide on a cycle?

22:52.037 --> 22:53.463
Shut up!

22:53.705 --> 22:54.640
So you're telling me

22:54.664 --> 22:55.767
you spent all that time with her

22:55.791 --> 22:57.393
and you never once, not once,

22:57.417 --> 22:59.219
thought of her as
anything except a friend?

23:00.170 --> 23:01.064
Never.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.565
Come on, Justin. I
saw her picture.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.057
You saw her negative.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.319
In real life, she's got
a hump and a harelip.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.519
Yeah, right.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.229
All right. Fine. She doesn't.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.981
But it doesn't matter
what she looks like,

23:12.557 --> 23:14.869
or how smart she is
or how funny she is,

23:14.893 --> 23:17.529
because what she isn't is you.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.657
And Julia, I'm nuts about you.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.659
And you know what else?

23:22.776 --> 23:26.214
I don't know what you did
every second of this summer.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.873
And that's okay
because I trust you.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.211
I trust that you would tell
me the important stuff.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.380
Because I'd tell you.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.149
This is when you say,

23:45.173 --> 23:47.559
"It's okay. I love you.

23:47.884 --> 23:50.113
The only reason I'm acting
like a nut bar is because

23:50.137 --> 23:52.480
I can't stand the thought
of you with anyone else."

24:08.113 --> 24:09.456
Let's see.

24:09.739 --> 24:10.883
Well, another pair of overalls.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.302
And, well, definitely
another pair of high-tops

24:13.326 --> 24:15.753
because, well, my old ones
have holes in them and...

24:16.037 --> 24:19.591
Morning. Kirsten's taking me to
get some back-to-school clothes.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.593
I grew half an inch
over the summer.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.136
You are? Today?

24:24.963 --> 24:26.973
I thought we were gonna
go to the stationers.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.601
I rescheduled.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.686
So, what does that mean?

24:32.637 --> 24:34.031
I didn't cancel, Charlie, okay?

24:34.055 --> 24:35.607
I rescheduled.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.444
Why? Are you punishing me?
Is that it?

24:39.561 --> 24:40.778
Uh-oh.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.947
Well, what's going on? Did
you guys have a fight?

24:43.523 --> 24:44.834
Never mind.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.409
I don't want to never mind.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.962
Well, I don't want
to talk about it.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.297
Well, why not?

24:49.321 --> 24:50.923
It's complicated, Claud.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.373
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

24:52.449 --> 24:54.594
It means you're too young
to understand, okay?

24:54.618 --> 24:55.960
Hey, you know what, Charlie?

24:56.036 --> 24:57.545
I am not a baby.

24:57.704 --> 25:00.798
I am two days away from junior high school.
I get stuff.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.186
Like I get that "Oh, you're
too young to understand"

25:03.210 --> 25:04.562
is just a lame excuse
for not telling me

25:04.586 --> 25:06.012
how you screwed something up.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.891
You're right, Claudia. It is.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.146
Well?

25:15.305 --> 25:17.148
I'm not punishing you, Charlie.

25:17.224 --> 25:20.109
I just... I can't go. Not today.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.955
I can't sit there
and pretend I care

25:22.979 --> 25:24.822
whether or not the
invitation says,

25:25.065 --> 25:26.375
"Please share our
happiness and joy"

25:26.399 --> 25:27.835
or "Please share our
joy and happiness,"

25:27.859 --> 25:29.369
when the fact of the matter is,

25:29.694 --> 25:31.088
I'm not experiencing a whole lot

25:31.112 --> 25:32.506
of either of those
things at the moment.

25:32.530 --> 25:35.208
And I certainly don't have
enough to share, okay?

25:43.291 --> 25:44.393
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.561
What are you doing here?

25:45.585 --> 25:47.396
Same as you. Picking
up my final.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.056
Jeez. Fifty-six
dollars after taxes.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.142
So, um...

25:53.301 --> 25:54.519
how did it go last night?

25:54.719 --> 25:55.905
Last night?

25:55.929 --> 25:56.989
Holly.

25:57.013 --> 25:59.983
Oh, that. That was great.

26:00.308 --> 26:01.901
You know, she's really great.

26:05.689 --> 26:06.906
Is it hard?

26:07.440 --> 26:08.700
What?

26:10.193 --> 26:13.246
Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of hard.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.133
I want it to work.

26:16.157 --> 26:18.251
Yeah. I know you do.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.264
- You know what I wish?
- What?

26:21.288 --> 26:22.974
I wish it could be
like you and Justin.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.893
You know, I wish we could just...
skip ahead four months

26:25.917 --> 26:27.927
through all the hard stuff,
till every thing's easy.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.399
What are you talking about?
It's... it's not easy.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.735
I mean... we've been
apart now nine weeks,

26:34.759 --> 26:36.894
and that's a long time.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.156
Things can happen to people.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.533
I mean, they can change.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.775
- You never know.
- Yeah, right.

26:43.476 --> 26:46.112
Stop trying to make me feel better.
You guys are perfect.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.739
You think?

26:48.189 --> 26:49.449
Hmm.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.326
Yeah, I guess.

26:51.901 --> 26:54.495
Definitely. I should be
thankful for what I have.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.164
Me too.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.125
I'm lucky.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.295
I'll tell you what.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.308
You give me a couple
weeks to get, you know,

27:05.332 --> 27:06.851
comfortable with everything,

27:06.875 --> 27:08.259
and we'll double-date.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.803
You, Justin, me and Holly. What do you say?
Is that a plan?

27:10.837 --> 27:12.639
Yeah. Definitely.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.390
Okay. I'll see you.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.194
Hey.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.331
Hey.

27:28.355 --> 27:31.876
Um... do you think we can
take a walk or something?

27:31.900 --> 27:34.077
You've ordered already,
sweetie, didn't you?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.329
It's okay. My boyfriend
already ordered.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.915
Oh. Um, I don't work here.

27:38.948 --> 27:41.918
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't see. I
just took my contacts out.

27:43.119 --> 27:44.921
Julia is, uh...

27:45.288 --> 27:47.507
Well, we... We kind
of know each other.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.342
Uh, this is Erica.

27:49.793 --> 27:50.728
Hi.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.261
Do you wear contacts?

27:52.420 --> 27:54.523
Because I was in New York this
summer doing some print stuff,

27:54.547 --> 27:56.817
and my agency said
I'd get more work

27:56.841 --> 27:58.935
with blue eyes instead of brown.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.188
Brown eyes are... out.

28:02.722 --> 28:05.108
- Are they?
- Oh, no offense or anything.

28:06.559 --> 28:10.446
So, what? Did you two take some kind
of class together or something?

28:14.859 --> 28:17.078
Look, um, I gotta go.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.841
You know, this could
be a pretty good year

28:20.865 --> 28:22.458
for you guys in Division Two.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.178
You know football?

28:24.202 --> 28:26.003
Poster of Steve
Young above my bed.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.715
Oh, yeah?

28:28.790 --> 28:30.591
I'd really love to
come see you play.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.510
I mean, I'm a real fan.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.889
So, where should we go?

28:44.097 --> 28:45.398
I'm sorry.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.818
What? About what?

28:50.270 --> 28:53.290
Will told me about you, and...

28:53.314 --> 28:55.825
And he told me that you
were this great person.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.254
And that you were really smart

28:58.278 --> 29:00.705
and funny and cute and nice.

29:01.698 --> 29:02.957
Whoa.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.010
I'm guessing this means

29:05.034 --> 29:07.295
you didn't have as good a
time last night as I did.

29:07.662 --> 29:08.963
No, I did.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.885
But I don't want to.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.972
That doesn't make
much sense, Bailey.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.516
It seems easy, you know?

29:21.134 --> 29:22.435
You know, we just...

29:23.219 --> 29:25.489
We just keep going out and
we keep having a great time,

29:25.513 --> 29:28.284
because I don't know how a
person could go out with you

29:28.308 --> 29:29.734
and not have a great time.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.072
And then you start
to matter to me.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.825
And...

29:38.818 --> 29:40.453
And I don't think I want that.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.999
What should I say?

29:45.742 --> 29:48.419
Well, you should say
that I'm an idiot.

29:50.371 --> 29:52.590
Because... Because...

29:54.125 --> 29:58.096
I'm gonna see you in six
months with some other guy,

29:58.296 --> 30:01.682
and I am gonna think that
that guy's so lucky.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.570
And I am gonna be so jealous.

30:04.594 --> 30:05.978
But...

30:06.596 --> 30:09.366
But I can't... yet.

30:09.390 --> 30:10.733
I can't.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.238
That's too bad.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.990
Can we just call it a night?

30:18.566 --> 30:19.909
Yeah.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.369
I'll walk you back.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.669
Good night, Holly.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.010
Okay, what if...

30:39.587 --> 30:41.180
What if I gave her money?

30:42.131 --> 30:44.360
Like, I got together a bunch
of money and I gave it to her

30:44.384 --> 30:46.269
on the promise that
she would stay away?

30:47.303 --> 30:50.148
I mean, I could do that.

30:51.724 --> 30:53.818
Would that make you happy?
Is that what you want?

30:54.477 --> 30:57.414
Don't put this on me. Don't
you dare do that to me!

30:57.438 --> 30:59.500
- None of this makes me happy.
- I know.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.918
I'd just like to know
how many children

31:00.942 --> 31:02.419
from how many different
mothers who are not me,

31:02.443 --> 31:04.338
am I gonna end up taking
care of in my life?

31:04.362 --> 31:05.580
Kirsten...

31:09.492 --> 31:10.918
That's not what I mean.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.504
I don't mean that.
I don't mean that.

31:16.791 --> 31:17.967
I'm sorry.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.055
I don't know what to
tell you, Charlie.

31:23.464 --> 31:24.984
Does it bother me that
you're the kind of guy

31:25.008 --> 31:26.193
who's had a baby
with another woman?

31:26.217 --> 31:27.602
You bet it does.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.729
Is it gonna matter between us?

31:30.013 --> 31:31.898
I'm gonna try to
make it not matter.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.026
But what happens when
that woman calls again?

31:36.185 --> 31:38.738
Or when that little boy comes
over to play with you?

31:39.272 --> 31:42.825
Or he needs something from
you, money or, or time.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.503
Something you give him

31:44.527 --> 31:46.964
and then don't have enough
left for Owen or Claudia...

31:46.988 --> 31:48.331
or me?

31:48.990 --> 31:50.791
I mean, what happens then?

31:53.453 --> 31:54.879
I don't know.

31:55.788 --> 31:57.506
I honestly don't know.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.689
I'm just...

32:14.724 --> 32:16.901
I'm trying to figure
out, you know,

32:17.018 --> 32:18.569
what's best for a kid.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.416
I mean, it's tough to
not have two parents.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.085
But... I mean, on the other hand,

32:25.109 --> 32:27.504
a little kid needs some sort
of stability, you know?

32:27.528 --> 32:30.748
Not have some stranger come
in and out of his life.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.126
What are you trying
to say, Charlie?

32:34.577 --> 32:36.170
I'm just trying
to figure it out.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.301
Whoops.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.428
He's a little commando.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.765
Yeah?

32:48.424 --> 32:50.017
I was too at his age.

32:50.885 --> 32:55.273
Anyway, uh... I could help
pay for things for him.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.525
Good.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.318
That would help a lot.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.289
But, you know, maybe me coming
in and out of his life...

33:02.313 --> 33:05.491
I mean, that could be exactly
what he doesn't need. I mean...

33:08.277 --> 33:10.579
Maybe it would be better.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.249
I understand.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.670
Look at that.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.631
It's his favorite toy.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.426
He could pound on that
little hammer till doomsday.

33:24.293 --> 33:25.803
Go figure, right?

33:28.756 --> 33:30.099
Right.

33:32.301 --> 33:34.603
Should we talk about
the money, Charlie?

33:46.149 --> 33:48.419
Uh... my boss just stepped out.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.286
He's gonna be back
any second now.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.955
He doesn't really like it
when friends of mine drop by.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.875
Why didn't you tell me?

33:57.118 --> 33:58.961
I don't know. You never
dropped by before.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.921
No.

34:01.497 --> 34:02.965
About her.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.967
Erica.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.928
I don't talk about
that kind of stuff.

34:08.170 --> 34:11.556
Why? You don't think it matters
that you have a girlfriend?

34:11.591 --> 34:13.225
Well, you have a
boyfriend, right?

34:14.217 --> 34:16.145
That Justin guy.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.940
Yeah. I know. What,
you thought I didn't?

34:22.476 --> 34:24.070
You never talk about him.

34:26.105 --> 34:27.081
So you and me,

34:27.106 --> 34:29.033
it's not like we're
going out or anything.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.534
Well, right.

34:31.694 --> 34:32.755
Of course not.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.164
I mean, we're not going out.

34:35.822 --> 34:37.208
So, what's the problem?

34:41.120 --> 34:42.545
I don't know.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.801
How about that, O?

34:48.043 --> 34:49.428
You're an uncle.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.306
Uncle Owen.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.610
Uncle Owen.

34:54.634 --> 34:57.395
"Hey, this is my Uncle Owen.
He's almost two."

34:57.470 --> 34:58.979
Kinda weird, huh?

34:59.013 --> 35:00.439
You were out all morning.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.234
Yeah.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.404
- You went to see her?
- Yeah, I did.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.116
Went to give her some money

35:10.191 --> 35:12.753
and to tell her that was
all I had to offer her.

35:12.777 --> 35:13.994
Just money.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.206
So, that's it then?

35:18.908 --> 35:22.554
Well, the thing is,
uh... he was there.

35:22.578 --> 35:23.838
Spencer.

35:24.580 --> 35:27.633
And, uh... he was playing and...

35:28.793 --> 35:31.345
And I was just
watching him and...

35:32.213 --> 35:34.140
He had this little
carpentry set...

35:35.341 --> 35:38.561
with these tools and
plastic workbench.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.980
It's his favorite toy.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.067
And I know this is stupid,
but I just kept thinking...

35:46.018 --> 35:47.611
you know, "He gets
that from me."

35:49.564 --> 35:51.416
I mean, where else would
he get that from?

35:51.440 --> 35:53.544
Not his mom. Not,
not some other guy.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.954
He's got... a little
piece of me in him.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.250
And I just thought, "Wow.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.796
Wow. What an amazing
thing." You know?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.634
Yeah.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.055
I'm a father.

36:16.507 --> 36:17.892
I'm his father.

36:19.635 --> 36:22.146
And don't laugh at me, but
I just keep thinking...

36:23.848 --> 36:25.441
"That little kid could love me."

36:37.778 --> 36:39.163
Coming over.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.499
Take it.

36:47.788 --> 36:49.548
Just so you know...

36:50.374 --> 36:52.051
Allison and I never danced.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.554
We had sex, but we never danced.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.392
I'm kidding.

37:00.676 --> 37:01.904
It's a joke. I'm joking.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.355
- It's not funny.
- Oh, come on.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.274
You want to laugh.
You know you do.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.577
But you're afraid
that if you laugh,

37:08.601 --> 37:10.871
it will mean that you're over
this whole Allison thing.

37:10.895 --> 37:11.955
And if you're over it,

37:11.979 --> 37:13.957
then you'll have no
reason to be mad at me.

37:13.981 --> 37:16.084
And then you'll just have to
resign yourself to the fact

37:16.108 --> 37:19.703
that you have a great boyfriend
and you love me desperately.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.707
- I got you.
- Oh, shut up and dance.

37:27.536 --> 37:30.224
Hey, did you see? Jenny
Hinton got braces.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.225
Ho, ho-ho.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.352
At her age, senior year, tragic.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.344
I say go with the overbite.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.222
So you having a good time?

37:39.173 --> 37:40.474
Sure.

37:40.591 --> 37:41.934
Yeah, I can tell.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.562
All right.

37:44.595 --> 37:45.980
To senior year.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.940
You know what this means, man?

37:48.432 --> 37:50.526
- No idea. What's it mean?
- Not a clue.

37:51.519 --> 37:52.903
Senior year.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.615
Ah!

37:59.110 --> 38:01.255
Claudia, what the hell
are you doing here?

38:01.279 --> 38:02.798
- I thought we told...
- I took the bus.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.248
I wanted to see.

38:05.908 --> 38:07.010
- Cool.
- Okay.

38:07.034 --> 38:08.387
You came, you saw,
you're going home.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.546
- Come on. I'll take you.
- I'll make a scene.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.307
- What?
- You heard me.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.049
I like your style, kiddo.

38:15.209 --> 38:16.635
Come on, Claud. Give me a break.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.762
Look, I swear I won't be a pest.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.023
Hey, I won't even say a word.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.775
I mean, you won't
even know I'm here.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.517
And the point of
this would be...

38:23.551 --> 38:26.312
Hey, I start something pretty
big tomorrow too, you know.

38:26.762 --> 38:29.523
Nobody throws a bonfire when
you start junior high school.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.150
In fact, you know...

38:31.309 --> 38:33.110
nobody does much of anything.
So...

38:34.061 --> 38:35.163
You kind of have to find a way

38:35.187 --> 38:36.581
of making it a big
deal for yourself.

38:36.605 --> 38:39.867
Because... it is a big deal.

38:40.526 --> 38:42.911
Junior high school, I mean,
it's a very big deal.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.998
I just wanna watch, Bay.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.341
Hold this a sec.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.885
Come here.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.976
You move, you speak,

39:06.510 --> 39:07.811
you're dead.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.740
- You know what?
- What?

39:20.274 --> 39:23.702
If you told me that you had
met somebody this summer,

39:23.778 --> 39:25.255
like a guy, a guy friend.

39:25.279 --> 39:26.538
Mm-hmm?

39:26.572 --> 39:28.707
I'd be perfectly okay with it.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.252
You would?

39:32.620 --> 39:33.680
No, you wouldn't.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.130
I totally would.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.476
I mean, in fact, I'd be happy

39:37.500 --> 39:40.594
that you didn't spend your
whole summer by yourself.

39:41.253 --> 39:43.023
Because you wouldn't have
written me all those letters

39:43.047 --> 39:46.401
or acted the way you
did over those photos

39:46.425 --> 39:48.018
if I weren't the one.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.187
The guy for you.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.742
Go ahead. Tell me I'm wrong.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.275
Argue with my logic.

39:56.852 --> 39:58.237
I'm cold.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.616
- This better?
- Tighter.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.078
Tighter.

40:12.535 --> 40:13.836
Is this seat taken?

40:17.456 --> 40:19.758
So is your friend meeting you here?
Holly?

40:20.334 --> 40:21.552
Oh, no.

40:21.627 --> 40:24.096
No, that's not really
happening, me and Holly.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.525
Really? I thought that
you guys were kinda...

40:26.549 --> 40:27.808
No.

40:28.384 --> 40:29.643
No.

40:30.594 --> 40:31.979
Not your type?

40:33.514 --> 40:34.940
No, she's...

40:35.558 --> 40:37.317
pretty much completely my type.

40:39.728 --> 40:41.363
It's me. It's my fault.

40:48.487 --> 40:49.872
Are you a good swimmer?

40:50.197 --> 40:51.457
Why?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.669
You aren't thinking of...

40:55.995 --> 40:58.547
Bailey, that water's
gotta be 50 degrees.

41:00.249 --> 41:02.217
It took me forever to
learn how to swim.

41:04.378 --> 41:08.108
My dad tried to teach me
but the... first time out,

41:08.132 --> 41:09.818
I cracked my head against
the side of the pool

41:09.842 --> 41:11.727
and swallowed all
this water and...

41:13.554 --> 41:15.063
after that, I couldn't.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.484
I wanted to. I just couldn't.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.613
And for the longest
time, I just...

41:23.731 --> 41:25.491
couldn't let go of the side.

41:26.358 --> 41:27.534
You know?

41:30.821 --> 41:33.081
Do you think I'm stupid, Sarah?

41:35.159 --> 41:36.752
I mean, do you think
it's okay if...

41:38.412 --> 41:40.923
If I wait for a while?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.675
Yeah, you know.

41:44.418 --> 41:46.303
I think you should wait...

41:47.546 --> 41:48.847
till you're ready.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.521
I miss her.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.369
So...

42:11.278 --> 42:13.038
school starts tomorrow.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.542
Can you believe it? Where
did the summer go?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.002
Who knows, you know?

42:21.539 --> 42:23.215
Maybe it'll be a great year.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.679
Maybe.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.434
Maybe.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.144
You looking for the lady?

43:17.428 --> 43:18.604
Yes.

43:18.637 --> 43:19.897
With the, uh, little boy.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.232
She cleared all her
stuff out this morning.

43:22.349 --> 43:23.734
Paid me the rent she owes.

43:25.644 --> 43:26.987
She's gone, man.
