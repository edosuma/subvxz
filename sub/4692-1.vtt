01:30.334 --> 01:34.584
Gods rule in Heaven, demons suffer in Hell,
and men stride the earth

01:35.084 --> 01:39.501
Bearing their sins, seeking enlightenment,
all three realms follow the rules of karma

01:40.042 --> 01:43.167
The Dark Crystal memorializes
the demons' bitter spiritual quest

01:43.626 --> 01:46.667
Once in each millennium, on July 15,
when the moon is full

01:46.709 --> 01:49.251
All beings can cross realms
through reincarnation

02:08.626 --> 02:12.584
This millennium's reincarnation day draws near;
Hell is sure to rumble

02:13.042 --> 02:16.209
The city of Hu is too close to the demons' grasp

02:16.542 --> 02:20.709
No matter how small their population,
they need to prepare

02:21.334 --> 02:24.376
Who's willing to go and look after the city?

02:28.042 --> 02:31.417
I volunteer to go help the people of Hu make
their way through this darkness

03:03.542 --> 03:05.167
Demon!

05:50.251 --> 05:52.667
Zhong Kui, what an amazing accomplishment!

06:09.001 --> 06:11.417
Sister, the Dark Crystal has been stolen!

06:29.792 --> 06:32.542
Who was wielding the sword of Hu?

06:33.084 --> 06:36.501
I didn't see his face,
just... a flash of golden light

06:36.542 --> 06:38.792
A flash of golden light?

06:40.959 --> 06:42.459
Could it have been one of the gods?

06:42.459 --> 06:44.334
No god can enter Hell!

06:44.376 --> 06:46.251
Please let me go reclaim our Dark Crystal!

06:54.042 --> 06:58.626
Now, time for you to pay me back...

07:26.626 --> 07:28.959
Demon Gallbladder Wine,
Demon Gallbladder Wine

07:40.667 --> 07:41.834
All you travelers, listen up!

07:41.876 --> 07:44.251
Every person has three souls and seven spirits.
Without life, the spirits can't exist

07:44.292 --> 07:47.042
Without spirits, life can't thrive.
The souls are the roots of the seven spirits

07:47.084 --> 07:50.084
And the seven spirits are the branches and leaves
of the souls. So what are these seven spirits?

07:50.126 --> 07:53.209
These spirits are actually the seven
chakras of the body, from head to toe

07:53.251 --> 07:54.876
Where human vitality lies

07:55.501 --> 08:00.376
Why do we sometimes feel tired, dull and drained?

08:01.001 --> 08:02.292
That's an excellent question, my good man. Come

08:02.334 --> 08:03.084
I didn't ask you anything

08:03.126 --> 08:04.959
Yes, it was you!

08:06.501 --> 08:09.334
Those are actually signs
that you're losing your spirits

08:09.376 --> 08:10.084
But I didn't ask

08:10.126 --> 08:12.334
And now my good man asks,
what are the seven spirits?

08:12.376 --> 08:15.959
They are the spirits of Yin, Wisdom,
Chi, Power, the Center,

08:16.001 --> 08:18.292
Brilliance and Essence

08:18.417 --> 08:20.667
Actually, they are... the seven spirits of man

08:20.792 --> 08:24.209
If a man loses three of them, he will die

08:24.876 --> 08:28.584
The world's a tough place these days.
We must take great care in our comings and goings

08:28.834 --> 08:31.417
So what can you do if a demon
sucks out your spirits?

08:34.042 --> 08:35.458
Nothing to fear

08:37.376 --> 08:40.667
My Spirit Protection Potion!
My family's secret formula!

08:40.792 --> 08:42.583
My great-great grandfather

08:42.583 --> 08:45.501
Created it using 300 different herbs

08:45.584 --> 08:49.084
It will protect your spirits!
One sip is all you need! Really!

08:49.126 --> 08:50.584
Does it really work?

08:53.667 --> 08:54.709
Yep.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.376
Come here.

09:00.792 --> 09:04.042
My wife can't get pregnant.
Can you take a look at her?

09:05.417 --> 09:09.542
It's so crowded today, Brother.
How about you come alone some other time?

09:12.084 --> 09:13.792
Now!

09:20.751 --> 09:22.209
Why are you groping me?

09:26.167 --> 09:29.042
Brother, your Essence Spirit is gone.

09:29.292 --> 09:31.751
Just like I said - the problem isn't me.

09:32.251 --> 09:33.251
What did you say?

09:33.292 --> 09:34.626
Your Essence Spirit is gone.

09:37.251 --> 09:39.834
You told me to take a look!
I said no, but you made me!

09:41.251 --> 09:42.459
Bull!

09:45.251 --> 09:46.417
Stop!

09:46.876 --> 09:48.042
Who the hell are you?

09:48.417 --> 09:49.792
Zhong Ling

09:51.001 --> 09:51.751
My wife

09:51.792 --> 09:52.584
Nonsense

09:52.626 --> 09:54.501
Sooner or later, I'll be your man...

09:54.834 --> 09:56.917
You are shameless! Hand...

09:59.626 --> 10:00.834
Remember this

10:01.042 --> 10:02.667
I can hit him

10:02.834 --> 10:05.667
And YOU cannot

10:06.667 --> 10:08.334
Zhong Ling, your brother's back!

10:08.334 --> 10:09.959
My brother is here? Come

10:20.334 --> 10:21.751
The Dark Crystal...

10:22.001 --> 10:23.334
Brother

10:24.501 --> 10:25.834
Brother

10:27.084 --> 10:28.959
What kind of demon is it this time?

10:32.001 --> 10:33.292
Master

10:33.584 --> 10:35.584
Master

10:35.626 --> 10:39.292
Come, drink this holy elixir,
replenish your strength

10:40.667 --> 10:43.584
Zhong Kui, the Dark Crystal contains

10:43.626 --> 10:46.292
All the spirits our good folk of Hu have lost

10:46.626 --> 10:49.376
After seven days, all shall be saved.

10:49.417 --> 10:51.376
Does that mean my brother can finally rest now?

10:51.417 --> 10:53.417
This is the critical time

10:53.459 --> 10:55.876
The demons in Hell will not rest for a moment

10:57.334 --> 10:59.251
The safety of Hu depends on

10:59.292 --> 11:01.792
Whether we can keep the
Dark Crystal out of their hands

11:01.834 --> 11:03.626
Master, please spare my brother.

11:03.876 --> 11:05.542
If my brother ever got... by a demon...

11:05.584 --> 11:06.792
Zhong Ling...

11:07.376 --> 11:08.667
Master...

11:10.334 --> 11:12.001
My sister has a point

11:13.042 --> 11:14.792
The demons are so powerful

11:15.542 --> 11:17.626
How can we humans defeat them?

11:17.959 --> 11:19.376
But you did once say

11:19.501 --> 11:23.751
You have a demon fighting technique
to defeat them, victory guaranteed

11:24.084 --> 11:26.417
And you would pass it on to me
at the critical moment

11:27.001 --> 11:28.751
Can now be considered that critical moment?

11:28.792 --> 11:30.209
Have you recovered your strength?

11:30.251 --> 11:31.251
No!

11:31.251 --> 11:32.876
Of course!

11:49.917 --> 11:52.917
Zhong Kui, you infiltrated the demon realm
and stole the Dark Crystal

11:52.959 --> 11:55.251
Proving yourself even more worthy of my trust

12:05.126 --> 12:08.292
Zhong Kui, as I once told you

12:08.584 --> 12:11.126
You are the warrior chosen by the gods

12:12.626 --> 12:16.959
Master, your every word becomes deeply
engraved in my heart

12:17.001 --> 12:19.292
But you have not yet realized
your full potential

12:19.792 --> 12:22.334
You... still require a little more training

12:25.126 --> 12:29.292
"A Year Ago"

12:36.042 --> 12:37.501
Keep an eye on her!

14:49.042 --> 14:51.292
The millennium full moon will be in ten days

14:51.334 --> 14:53.917
Your sacred duty is to keep the Dark Crystal safe

14:54.126 --> 14:58.084
Zhong Kui, I will give you even greater power

15:03.834 --> 15:06.126
This is the legendary magic fan

15:06.667 --> 15:08.959
Formed of the bones and blood of
10,000 year-old bats

15:16.084 --> 15:20.042
When a man uses a holy weapon,
its power will bounce back to wound him

15:20.292 --> 15:22.334
He must endure severe pain

15:22.792 --> 15:25.501
Are you ready for that pain?

15:25.626 --> 15:29.126
Master, I can take it!
Please allow me to fight those demons

15:29.167 --> 15:32.001
The pain I'd suffer if I fail to
defeat them: that is true pain

15:32.209 --> 15:33.667
Marvelous!

16:12.792 --> 16:14.709
He is your potential

16:15.084 --> 16:16.792
Your other side

16:17.042 --> 16:19.917
Zhong Kui, he is you

16:47.459 --> 16:49.876
Zhong Kui, each time you open this fan

16:50.042 --> 16:52.292
The demon inside you will be unleashed

16:52.751 --> 16:55.584
The greater your power,
the more focused you must be

16:56.042 --> 16:59.584
Lest you succumb to your inner
demon and fall to darkness

17:00.126 --> 17:03.459
Remember, never open this fan
in front of others

17:03.917 --> 17:07.291
Seeing you in this form,
they would think you're a demon

18:28.667 --> 18:31.834
To use your power with ease,
the key is to train your mind

18:32.167 --> 18:33.834
Only when you master your mind

18:33.876 --> 18:36.709
Can you transcend your pain and harness your power

19:01.376 --> 19:04.376
Submerge your heart... calm your Chi

19:36.292 --> 19:38.126
Unsheathe your sword!

19:40.917 --> 19:42.542
It's sheathed in your spine!

20:20.042 --> 20:25.209
Drink this holy elixir. It will ease your symptoms

20:32.584 --> 20:36.834
To slay demons, you must first purge
your heart of demons

20:46.459 --> 20:50.167
Master!

21:05.167 --> 21:08.834
Behold! Who says humans can't defeat demons?

21:09.251 --> 21:11.834
Today, you are victorious.

21:12.167 --> 21:16.584
The Dark Crystal is yours now,
and a new world is upon us

21:18.042 --> 21:20.209
In seven days, on the night of the full moon

21:20.251 --> 21:22.709
Your spirits will return to you

21:22.959 --> 21:27.251
The demons will shrivel away,
and Hu will enjoy eternal peace

21:28.959 --> 21:32.417
The demons will surely attack us
in full force within the week

21:32.459 --> 21:35.501
If you stand united, you will all be heroes

21:35.751 --> 21:38.292
I... will fight by your side

21:38.376 --> 21:39.834
YES!

21:39.876 --> 21:41.959
The demons who harm us will be killed

21:42.042 --> 21:46.292
May Master show us what to do,
Heaven bless our City of Hu!

21:46.417 --> 21:53.876
May Master show us what to do,
Heaven bless our City of Hu!

22:01.792 --> 22:03.959
MOVE, MOVE!

22:16.792 --> 22:18.334
So pretty

22:24.917 --> 22:27.417
Enough looking! Could you be any more shameless?

22:27.459 --> 22:28.917
Be careful or that soul of yours
will be sucked right out!

22:29.001 --> 22:32.376
That babe can have my soul or
spirits whenever she wants!

22:33.167 --> 22:34.626
Your clearance orders?

22:35.667 --> 22:38.334
It's permission to enter Tang,
issued by the capital

22:48.834 --> 22:50.292
Which part of the West are you from?

22:50.334 --> 22:51.167
Lou Lan

22:51.209 --> 22:52.334
When did you set out for here?

22:52.376 --> 22:53.876
Two months ago

22:56.876 --> 23:00.376
No one enters the city without
Lord Zhong Kui's permission

23:00.417 --> 23:02.084
You're not allowed in! Search them!

23:02.417 --> 23:04.001
Everybody get out now

23:04.042 --> 23:07.709
Wait! None shall leave before I search them

23:30.584 --> 23:32.126
Turn around

23:50.167 --> 23:51.667
Little Snow?

23:52.584 --> 23:55.751
I am Snow Girl, from the West

23:59.834 --> 24:01.417
May we pass now?

24:02.917 --> 24:04.334
Go

24:15.709 --> 24:20.001
Do all girls from the West have such cold hands?

24:29.209 --> 24:30.376
Let them through!

24:30.501 --> 24:31.959
Let them through!

24:35.292 --> 24:38.542
Come to our show tomorrow night!
Like nothing you've seen before!

24:38.542 --> 24:40.292
Don't miss it!

24:40.834 --> 24:43.167
Come to the show!

24:56.792 --> 25:01.709
Step aside! Search them!

25:03.376 --> 25:06.209
What are these? Open it!

25:10.751 --> 25:14.459
Little Snow, where have you been
these past three years?

25:18.917 --> 25:20.626
I don't know you

25:27.292 --> 25:31.251
I'm Zhong Kui, only with a beard now

25:31.751 --> 25:33.209
I am a demon slayer now

25:33.417 --> 25:37.792
A demon slayer? Are you fond of
killing demons, my Lord?

25:39.751 --> 25:41.751
It's either them or me

25:45.667 --> 25:47.376
I guess you're not Little Snow after all

25:47.626 --> 25:49.917
I've never been to this city before

26:06.501 --> 26:08.251
Sister, what's wrong?

26:08.292 --> 26:10.751
The guy who stopped our caravan earlier...
why did he come back?

26:36.376 --> 26:37.917
Haven't you stared enough?

26:38.334 --> 26:39.501
No...

26:39.501 --> 26:40.251
Come here and make yourself useful

26:40.292 --> 26:41.542
I'm not done looking...

26:44.376 --> 26:46.917
All my souls and spirits are here with you

26:46.959 --> 26:48.417
Ah, there goes your silver tongue

26:53.126 --> 26:57.042
I hear some gorgeous women from
the West arrived in town yesterday

26:57.417 --> 26:59.209
So beautiful they look like she-demons?

26:59.251 --> 27:02.126
They don't just "look" like demons...
they ARE demons!

27:02.584 --> 27:03.917
So you were there?

27:04.417 --> 27:08.334
I... I... no...I was

27:08.542 --> 27:10.334
Well... the guys said

27:10.334 --> 27:11.751
there were a bunch of gorgeous babes

27:11.792 --> 27:15.001
So... uh... I just stopped by to have a look

27:15.042 --> 27:16.292
Just one look

27:16.334 --> 27:18.584
Well... were they pretty?

27:21.292 --> 27:22.876
Brother's home!

27:45.042 --> 27:46.667
What's wrong with my brother?

27:46.709 --> 27:48.084
Dunno...

27:52.834 --> 27:57.084
"Three Years Ago"

28:04.292 --> 28:06.251
One who gains enlightenment at
dawn can die fulfilled that night

28:06.251 --> 28:09.584
A scholar sets his intent on the Way,
and is humble in his dress and habits

28:32.584 --> 28:34.042
Who's there?

28:44.626 --> 28:46.292
There is righteousness in this world

28:46.334 --> 28:48.042
And it makes the sun and moon shine brighter

28:48.334 --> 28:50.376
When calm, be as a sleeping dragon

28:53.042 --> 28:54.292
When angry, don't refrain from speaking out

28:54.292 --> 28:55.709
Come out!

29:01.959 --> 29:03.417
My song will bring demons and gods to tears

29:03.626 --> 29:05.167
My dance will reach Heaven and Earth

29:05.459 --> 29:07.292
My words will fill the rivers and mountains

29:09.167 --> 29:11.042
And morals will return to the world

30:13.376 --> 30:16.209
I apologize for the other day, my Lady

30:16.584 --> 30:20.834
But I, Zhong Kui... am righteous,
and reject low and frivolous things

30:21.376 --> 30:26.417
I eschew luxury, avoid intimacy,
and hold myself apart

30:26.709 --> 30:29.959
My sole desire is to make a great contribution

30:30.126 --> 30:32.042
to the glory of our Tang Empire

31:08.251 --> 31:09.834
May I come in?

31:12.626 --> 31:15.792
I was in a hurry, but- alas,
I encountered a blizzard

31:17.917 --> 31:20.501
My Lady, your hands are so cold

31:21.667 --> 31:24.959
My name is Little Snow;
I've been icy cold since birth

31:30.917 --> 31:32.751
It's so cold in here

31:33.959 --> 31:35.376
I don't have a fire basin

31:35.584 --> 31:38.959
You're studying so you can better
serve the glory of the Tang Dynasty, right?

31:39.417 --> 31:40.584
How do you know that, my Lady?

31:40.626 --> 31:42.834
Can you even remember all these books you've read?

31:43.959 --> 31:45.001
Yes.

31:45.042 --> 31:46.917
The Duke of Bo Chapter of the Confucian Analects:

31:46.959 --> 31:49.501
A scholar must have strong ambition and
will: the burden is heavy, and the road is long

31:49.542 --> 31:53.334
If he lacks ambition, he cannot carry the burden;
if he lacks will, he cannot complete the journey

31:53.667 --> 31:56.042
If one feels it his duty to achieve compassion,
is that not a heavy burden?

31:56.292 --> 31:58.709
If one is willing to persist to the end,
is that not a long journey?

31:59.292 --> 32:00.959
Sun Tzu's "Art of War":

32:01.459 --> 32:04.334
When in a Dead End Land one must not
show one's fear of death

32:04.667 --> 32:06.334
When fighting in enemy territory,
go in deep and the troops will stay focused;

32:06.334 --> 32:08.417
remain on the edge
and they will never bond together

32:08.667 --> 32:10.834
An area with no way out is a Dead Land

32:11.001 --> 32:13.459
When in a Dead Land,
one mustn't show fear of death

32:13.542 --> 32:15.292
Therefore, in matters of military strategy...

32:15.334 --> 32:16.834
... one becomes a bookworm

32:18.251 --> 32:19.459
The Book of Rites:

32:19.876 --> 32:21.292
To await someone worthy of love

32:21.334 --> 32:24.751
To wait through past and present lives,
is it worth it?

32:29.251 --> 32:30.709
Does the Book of Rites really say that?

32:38.917 --> 32:40.042
Is it not worth it?

32:48.376 --> 32:49.834
I was wondering why she looked so familiar

32:49.876 --> 32:51.792
The one I said is especially beautiful

32:51.834 --> 32:53.709
looks exactly like the lady in that painting

32:55.084 --> 32:56.209
Are you kidding, or for real?

32:56.209 --> 32:57.584
Why would I lie about that?

33:02.084 --> 33:04.292
I return to Heaven tomorrow

33:04.792 --> 33:07.501
The demons will fight to the death
for the Dark Crystal

33:08.626 --> 33:10.417
The Kirin will help you guard it

33:21.334 --> 33:22.834
Zhong Kui

33:22.959 --> 33:25.251
You must protect the Dark Crystal.
Make sure it's intact

36:00.501 --> 36:05.042
What happens tomorrow night will determine
our fates for the next millenium

36:08.292 --> 36:10.209
Are all of you ready?

36:11.542 --> 36:13.209
How long have you been a demon?

36:14.209 --> 36:15.709
Six centuries?

36:17.209 --> 36:19.626
And you, nine centuries?

36:20.834 --> 36:22.751
And you must be over a thousand years old, right?

36:23.584 --> 36:26.001
If we fail, that means...

36:26.042 --> 36:28.917
We'll have to suffer in Hell
for another thousand years

36:29.251 --> 36:31.376
The hardship of spiritual practice is bearable

36:32.501 --> 36:36.376
What scares me more... is the loss of hope

36:40.251 --> 36:42.667
You shall not transform without my order!

36:44.042 --> 36:47.334
You must make your utmost effort tomorrow night...

36:48.251 --> 36:51.209
to not draw anyone's suspicion

36:52.876 --> 36:54.751
Especially the demon slayers'!

36:57.959 --> 37:00.501
I want to drink! Who dares to try to stop me?

37:13.459 --> 37:14.959
I want Demon Gallbladder Wine!

37:15.001 --> 37:16.376
We don't have any!

37:17.501 --> 37:20.459
I knew you wouldn't, so I brought my own

37:48.001 --> 37:51.251
Have a sip with me... just one sip

37:54.417 --> 37:55.959
My Lord, please

38:00.167 --> 38:01.917
Why is it so cold?

38:02.626 --> 38:05.709
Frost is flying in July.
There's a chill in the air

38:08.167 --> 38:10.667
Rumor has it that demons are in the city

38:11.084 --> 38:14.292
Demons are coming to destroy Hu.
Have you heard, my Lord?

38:15.334 --> 38:17.834
Great! It's showtime!

38:18.376 --> 38:20.459
How do you catch demons, Lord Zhong?

38:24.001 --> 38:27.251
Using my eyes... I fix my eyes on them...

38:27.459 --> 38:29.292
Until they reveal themselves!

38:43.376 --> 38:45.709
What are demons like in broad daylight?

38:45.709 --> 38:49.251
Most demons take the form of beautiful women

38:49.792 --> 38:51.542
Is there a demon Lord Zhong won't slay?

39:00.084 --> 39:02.042
Come see my performance tomorrow night!

39:03.459 --> 39:05.917
Depends on who it is!

39:19.876 --> 39:22.667
Sister, what if he doesn't come tomorrow?

39:26.417 --> 39:28.042
He will

39:37.584 --> 39:39.001
To await someone worthy of love

39:39.042 --> 39:41.292
To wait through past and present lives

39:41.334 --> 39:42.709
Is it worth it?

39:44.417 --> 39:50.501
When bewitching the heart of a man,
beware of falling under your own spell

39:51.792 --> 39:54.709
"Three Years Ago"

40:06.167 --> 40:09.834
Under the snow-covered plum tree,
Zhong Kui meets Little Snow

40:12.209 --> 40:14.167
Let the plum blossoms be our witnesses

40:14.917 --> 40:16.959
We shall be like Heaven and Earth, You and Me

40:18.834 --> 40:20.334
Heaven and Earth?

40:22.251 --> 40:24.459
But I'm not a Moon Goddess

40:27.042 --> 40:29.501
You are my... Snow Girl

40:40.709 --> 40:42.667
If I were a demon,

40:44.084 --> 40:45.834
would you still love me?

40:46.834 --> 40:48.792
If you were truly a demon

40:50.084 --> 40:52.001
My spirits would be long gone by now

40:54.501 --> 40:59.417
Is a demon's love... undeserving of a human's?

40:59.542 --> 41:03.584
Humans and demons walk separate paths.
Always have and always will

41:08.834 --> 41:10.917
Nothing is colder than the blood of humans

42:16.792 --> 42:19.126
What is illusion?

42:19.501 --> 42:25.751
Illusion gives you what was never
yours to begin with

42:26.626 --> 42:30.501
Name your wishes, what do you want?

42:30.542 --> 42:33.334
Money! Lots and lots of it!

42:33.376 --> 42:36.001
With money, I can have everything

42:36.334 --> 42:38.042
Here you go

42:38.126 --> 42:39.584
But don't think it's real

42:46.126 --> 42:49.542
Money... oh money

42:54.501 --> 42:56.167
He's not here yet

42:58.001 --> 42:59.334
Now it's your turn

43:15.709 --> 43:19.376
"See you at the school courtyard - Snow"

44:11.167 --> 44:12.709
To await someone worthy of love

44:13.542 --> 44:16.417
To wait through past and present lives...

44:19.542 --> 44:21.167
Is it worth it?

44:47.001 --> 44:48.751
Dark Crystal...

44:48.917 --> 44:51.001
Please leave the Demon Suppressing Pagoda

44:55.209 --> 44:57.917
Dark Crystal, please come here

44:58.167 --> 45:02.626
Let the people of Hu regain their lost spirits

51:03.667 --> 51:05.209
Let's move!

51:06.959 --> 51:08.584
Bring it back to Hell

51:09.584 --> 51:10.667
Sister? Aren't you coming?

51:10.709 --> 51:12.209
You go first

51:13.709 --> 51:15.126
Go,now

51:37.501 --> 51:40.542
There are demons in the city...
trying to steal the Dark Crystal...

51:48.334 --> 51:50.042
Did you capture them?

51:59.042 --> 52:01.542
You're not the Little Snow you were back then

52:02.376 --> 52:04.834
And I'm no longer the same Zhong Kui

52:06.001 --> 52:07.834
You are a demon!

52:22.584 --> 52:24.542
Are you going to kill me?

52:56.584 --> 52:58.792
I won't let anyone hurt you!

53:15.376 --> 53:17.334
The Dark Crystal has returned!

53:22.501 --> 53:24.084
Where is it?

53:26.084 --> 53:28.917
Your Highness... I never opened it!

53:29.251 --> 53:33.542
Those tricky humans. You have all been fooled

53:34.251 --> 53:37.084
I entered the Pagoda...
and there was a black monster there

53:37.126 --> 53:39.042
A black monster?!

53:39.292 --> 53:41.459
My sister and her people are in danger now

53:47.751 --> 53:50.751
Your Highness... I need to go back

54:15.126 --> 54:16.959
Why is your brother leaving her here?

54:17.292 --> 54:19.084
She's brother's lover

54:33.917 --> 54:35.126
Are you looking for me?

54:37.501 --> 54:38.959
You dropped your sword

54:39.167 --> 54:41.959
You're using sorcery again,
don't you dare scare him!

54:44.251 --> 54:45.584
I don't know you...

54:45.917 --> 54:47.417
but I know who you are

54:47.709 --> 54:50.917
You're the one in my brother's painting.
You're Little Snow!

54:52.126 --> 54:54.542
Three years ago, you left without a word

54:54.834 --> 54:57.542
Do you know how my brother pined for you,
every day for the past three years?

54:58.084 --> 54:59.417
Every night that winter...

54:59.459 --> 55:01.542
He'd pass out drunk under the blossoming plum tree

55:01.751 --> 55:04.042
When morning came, he'd be blanketed in snow

55:04.626 --> 55:05.876
He didn't die...

55:05.917 --> 55:07.542
But it was like he lost his life when you left

55:07.584 --> 55:09.501
Why did you leave him?

55:10.292 --> 55:14.126
Come watch the dancing girls
get arrested! Let's go!

55:24.876 --> 55:28.501
Last night, a deadly fight took place here

55:29.417 --> 55:31.709
Demons were trying to steal the Dark Crystal

55:33.126 --> 55:34.709
But they failed!

55:34.751 --> 55:37.667
The Dark Crystal is still ours...

55:37.792 --> 55:39.584
Just as I'm still yours...

55:43.792 --> 55:46.917
But the danger hasn't passed yet

55:47.417 --> 55:50.876
We must unite ourselves over these last three days

55:50.917 --> 55:52.917
To ensure we don't lose the Dark Crystal

55:52.917 --> 55:56.126
And in the end... eternal peace
will dawn on the City of Hu

56:00.417 --> 56:02.042
Do you know them?

56:02.126 --> 56:04.167
They're dancers

56:12.542 --> 56:14.251
Demons!

56:16.626 --> 56:18.292
Kill the demons!

56:28.292 --> 56:29.876
Kill the demons!

56:39.084 --> 56:40.751
The smell of demons...

57:07.667 --> 57:09.126
Sister...

57:09.667 --> 57:11.667
Isn't she that dancer?

57:11.709 --> 57:13.584
She's a snow demon!

57:14.459 --> 57:16.042
No matter what kind of demons they are...

57:16.209 --> 57:18.167
If they dare set foot on this land...

57:18.167 --> 57:19.876
there's only one end in store for them

57:19.917 --> 57:22.292
Kill her! Kill her!

57:39.876 --> 57:42.917
Zhong Kui, it's your turn now!

57:59.001 --> 58:00.501
Kill the demons!

58:22.917 --> 58:24.251
Kill her!

58:30.084 --> 58:32.834
Kill the demons! Kill the demons!

59:02.042 --> 59:03.501
Master...

59:07.542 --> 59:09.417
Please spare her life!

59:16.167 --> 59:17.792
Fine!

59:22.376 --> 59:23.834
Brother!

59:24.792 --> 59:26.709
The demons are attacking our city!

59:55.167 --> 59:56.001
Protect the Dark Crystal!

59:56.042 --> 59:57.376
Yes, Master!

59:58.542 --> 01:00:00.001
Follow me!

01:01:23.334 --> 01:01:27.834
Zhang, you've been behind this all along!

01:01:27.876 --> 01:01:29.417
About time!

01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:54.626
Zhong Kui! I bestow the almighty power upon you!

01:01:54.751 --> 01:01:56.626
Protect the City of Hu!

01:02:00.167 --> 01:02:02.542
So the Black Monster is Zhong Kui

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:32.334
Zhong Kui, kill him!

01:05:36.209 --> 01:05:37.001
Kill him!

01:05:37.042 --> 01:05:38.792
Protect his Highness!

01:05:57.501 --> 01:05:59.917
How dare you align with our enemies today!

01:06:00.126 --> 01:06:01.626
One mistake after another

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:05.167
Go, kill that snow demon!

01:06:51.584 --> 01:06:53.209
Get out!

01:07:15.459 --> 01:07:20.251
The way you hold that sword...
hasn't changed a bit

01:07:38.876 --> 01:07:40.626
I'm taking you with me!

01:08:45.084 --> 01:08:46.417
Zhong Kui

01:08:47.334 --> 01:08:48.667
Water

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.126
Water

01:09:00.209 --> 01:09:01.709
Water... here's water

01:09:03.376 --> 01:09:04.709
More

01:09:09.334 --> 01:09:10.834
Water... Zhong Kui!

01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:40.167
How is it that you can transform?

01:09:42.084 --> 01:09:43.959
I'm about to burst!

01:10:02.626 --> 01:10:05.542
So it was you at the Pagoda the other day?

01:10:14.126 --> 01:10:15.792
Don't you hurt him!

01:10:19.959 --> 01:10:21.667
I'm here to save him!

01:10:23.126 --> 01:10:24.792
The Spirit-Reviving Elixir?

01:10:28.167 --> 01:10:30.709
Zhong Kui, this is no magic elixir

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.876
Zhang feeds you this every other day...

01:10:34.167 --> 01:10:36.001
to protect your seven spirits from scattering

01:10:36.042 --> 01:10:38.417
The soul is lost, but the spirits are intact.
Do you get it now?

01:10:39.792 --> 01:10:41.126
Drink this

01:10:43.459 --> 01:10:45.792
Sister, take him back to Hell

01:10:45.959 --> 01:10:48.042
His Highness will explain everything to him

01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:09.417
Citizens, listen up! The curfew will be
in effect from 7pm to 5am

01:11:10.876 --> 01:11:12.876
I hear it was Lord Zhong who let that demon go

01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:14.667
He ran away too

01:11:15.417 --> 01:11:16.959
Demons are demons, after all

01:11:17.001 --> 01:11:18.751
Even Lord Zhong couldn't resist her charms

01:11:24.167 --> 01:11:26.751
None shall enter the city without a permit

01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:30.292
Any demon sightings must be reported immediately

01:11:31.751 --> 01:11:33.792
What are you doing?!

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.751
Brother?

01:11:40.334 --> 01:11:42.709
Brother... brother

01:11:42.834 --> 01:11:44.042
What happened to you?

01:11:44.042 --> 01:11:48.042
Citizens, listen up! The curfew will be
in effect from 7pm to 5am

01:11:48.334 --> 01:11:50.876
None shall enter the city without a permit

01:11:51.334 --> 01:11:53.709
Any demon sightings must be reported immediately

01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:57.501
Can you check and see what's happened to me?

01:12:24.334 --> 01:12:26.042
Your spirits are fine...

01:12:31.251 --> 01:12:32.584
Brother...

01:12:36.876 --> 01:12:38.459
What is it, Du Ping?

01:12:38.834 --> 01:12:41.667
I can't feel his pulse

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:45.584
Brother, you've lost your life force

01:12:47.376 --> 01:12:51.792
That's outrageous! Liar! How can Brother be dead?

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:54.917
Isn't he right here now? You're lying!

01:13:04.209 --> 01:13:06.292
How did I smash my head on the golden tablet?

01:13:08.167 --> 01:13:10.292
And how did I come back?

01:13:11.959 --> 01:13:13.834
Why can't I remember anything?

01:14:28.876 --> 01:14:33.626
I couldn't stop crying.
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:36.209
And then?

01:14:36.376 --> 01:14:38.709
Then Master Zhang brought you back

01:14:39.417 --> 01:14:40.959
A god is a god

01:14:41.001 --> 01:14:43.667
You came back as if nothing had happened

01:14:43.876 --> 01:14:47.042
Not even a scar on your head

01:16:08.459 --> 01:16:10.376
I need to go to Hell

01:16:13.292 --> 01:16:15.209
I need to find out who I really am

01:16:19.376 --> 01:16:20.959
I'm going with you

01:16:41.959 --> 01:16:45.501
Zhong Kui... you are here

01:16:46.334 --> 01:16:50.334
All love between humans and demons
is bound to be star-crossed

01:16:50.501 --> 01:16:55.917
And you, Xue Qing. Fell for a mix of both!

01:17:02.001 --> 01:17:03.376
Stop!

01:17:11.251 --> 01:17:16.042
Without the Dark Crystal, Hell has no future

01:17:16.084 --> 01:17:17.667
Let her go

01:17:20.667 --> 01:17:25.292
Zhong Kui, scholar from Hu, you were meant to be
the highest-ranked scholar of this Dynasty

01:17:25.542 --> 01:17:29.417
But you were framed by an evildoer and died when
you smashed your head on the Golden Tablet

01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:33.876
Your wronged soul was resurrected by Zhang

01:17:34.042 --> 01:17:37.376
And he trained you to steal
the Dark Crystal for him

01:17:37.417 --> 01:17:39.042
You're lying!

01:17:40.876 --> 01:17:42.917
This is your blade, right?

01:17:43.209 --> 01:17:48.001
Only demons can enter our world. Even gods can't

01:17:48.209 --> 01:17:52.292
If you aren't a demon,
how can you grow 10 feet tall?

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:55.584
Zhang has turned you into a demon

01:17:55.751 --> 01:17:58.417
Zhong Kui... you are a demon

01:17:58.584 --> 01:18:00.709
I am not a demon!

01:18:30.376 --> 01:18:32.501
This is my true self

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.792
Don't you want the truth?

01:18:38.584 --> 01:18:40.334
This is the truth!

01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:46.042
This millennium's day of reincarnation is dawning

01:18:46.459 --> 01:18:48.126
Are you ready to become a god?

01:18:48.126 --> 01:18:50.459
We've never once ceased our spiritual practice,
no matter how hard it might be

01:18:50.626 --> 01:18:52.251
With the very little spiritual force you have...

01:18:52.501 --> 01:18:54.792
You lack the energy needed to
fully power the Dark Crystal

01:18:55.376 --> 01:18:56.667
You can, however...

01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:59.626
Suck away the humans' spirits
and empower yourselves

01:19:00.084 --> 01:19:02.834
This is the only shortcut for
powering up the Dark Crystal

01:19:03.209 --> 01:19:06.167
But isn't that against the rule of Heaven?

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:11.292
Finally, I couldn't resist the temptation

01:19:11.501 --> 01:19:15.209
And the Dark Crystal's energy grew so quickly

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:19.001
It wasn't until I saw you in Hu

01:19:19.126 --> 01:19:21.667
that I realized what was happening

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:26.167
What did Master plan to do with the Dark Crystal?

01:19:26.334 --> 01:19:31.834
It is now the greatest force of all three realms

01:19:32.126 --> 01:19:34.042
If he were to gain control of it

01:19:34.209 --> 01:19:36.501
Chaos would result, and all beings
face utter annihilation

01:19:36.501 --> 01:19:38.167
Don't you even think of using me

01:19:38.501 --> 01:19:40.001
I'm not a demon!

01:19:40.001 --> 01:19:42.667
The people who lost their spirits were innocent

01:19:44.126 --> 01:19:48.334
So are most of the demons in my realm!

01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:53.334
I broke the rules,
and I'll suffer the consequences

01:19:57.084 --> 01:19:58.667
But what about Little Snow?

01:19:58.876 --> 01:20:03.292
If the Dark Crystal is opened tomorrow,
she'll vanish into thin air

01:20:04.876 --> 01:20:08.126
You won't even save her?

01:20:16.667 --> 01:20:19.042
Don't we look alike?

01:20:28.876 --> 01:20:30.501
But you're not me...

01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:34.042
And I'm not you.

01:20:37.209 --> 01:20:39.376
We both have a destiny to fulfill

01:20:45.917 --> 01:20:48.292
If you can manage to recapture my power

01:20:49.751 --> 01:20:51.959
You can stop Zhang Daoxian

01:20:52.917 --> 01:20:55.626
Only you can restore

01:20:57.417 --> 01:20:59.667
the order of the three realms

01:21:52.792 --> 01:21:57.084
Zhang Daoxian will use the Dark Crystal's power
to destroy mankind

01:21:57.626 --> 01:22:01.876
Tomorrow's full moon marks the end of human
and demon realms

01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:06.626
The Dark Crystal holds the record of
our spiritual cultivation

01:22:07.667 --> 01:22:10.376
Only once, every thousand years,
on the 15th day of the 7th month

01:22:10.834 --> 01:22:15.167
Do we have a chance to purge our sins
and gain rebirth

01:22:15.501 --> 01:22:17.334
Some become gods

01:22:17.667 --> 01:22:19.376
And others remain demons

01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:21.626
It is the work of the Dark Crystal

01:22:21.792 --> 01:22:23.709
That decides these destinies

01:22:27.084 --> 01:22:29.001
I'm a demon slayer

01:22:29.834 --> 01:22:32.001
Killing your kind is all I know how to do

01:22:33.876 --> 01:22:36.126
How can I save your world?

01:22:49.584 --> 01:22:51.042
Master Zhang

01:22:53.959 --> 01:22:56.084
What are you doing here with the Dark Crystal?

01:22:58.667 --> 01:23:00.626
Have you obtained the Spirit-Reviving Elixir?

01:23:05.417 --> 01:23:07.292
You went to Hell

01:23:08.542 --> 01:23:10.084
Where is the Demon King?

01:23:13.667 --> 01:23:16.084
Is it true, what he said?

01:23:19.376 --> 01:23:22.584
You got here just in time! Come!

01:23:23.292 --> 01:23:25.542
Tomorrow is July 15

01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:27.959
Our distinguished guests will all be here

01:23:28.834 --> 01:23:30.501
Allow me to introduce them

01:23:30.959 --> 01:23:34.084
Here sits Heavenly King Li

01:23:35.334 --> 01:23:38.709
His son Nezha achieved great fame at an early age

01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:43.751
This is Avalokitesvara

01:23:44.126 --> 01:23:46.917
The truly merciful, who shall bring us salvation

01:23:49.876 --> 01:23:52.001
This is the Queen of Heaven

01:23:52.251 --> 01:23:55.292
The magic cudgel from the West's
Great Kunlun Mountains

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:03.876
And this is the Jade Emperor

01:24:05.251 --> 01:24:07.584
Who has been sitting on that throne
for over 10,000 years

01:24:12.209 --> 01:24:16.876
Such a banquet. Where do you
think I should sit?

01:24:18.751 --> 01:24:21.501
Zhong Kui, I should thank you

01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:24.501
You are the one who brought me the Dark Crystal

01:24:27.542 --> 01:24:29.209
Tomorrow, at midnight

01:24:29.376 --> 01:24:32.459
I will attain the highest spiritual
cultivation of all three realms

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:34.501
And from this day forth

01:24:38.876 --> 01:24:42.251
The throne will forever be mine!

01:24:42.834 --> 01:24:46.709
So, everything you've told me...

01:24:47.792 --> 01:24:49.084
Was a lie?

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:52.751
The best stories convince everyone

01:24:53.376 --> 01:24:54.584
Think about it

01:24:54.917 --> 01:24:58.126
Who would still worship the gods
if the world were at peace?

01:24:58.917 --> 01:25:00.876
No desire, no needs

01:25:01.042 --> 01:25:04.084
Humans must have dreams in order
to become believers

01:25:04.792 --> 01:25:07.459
Now, with fear in their hearts, they'll need me

01:25:07.501 --> 01:25:08.917
Zhang Daoxian

01:25:08.917 --> 01:25:12.084
You're already a god.
What more do you wish for?

01:25:18.584 --> 01:25:19.959
You've never been to Heaven

01:25:20.167 --> 01:25:23.167
You don't know how high the stairs reach

01:25:23.501 --> 01:25:25.417
Am I a god lesser than any of those others?

01:25:25.876 --> 01:25:27.917
Why should I be the one stuck at the bottom?

01:25:28.084 --> 01:25:30.334
I've never even set foot
in the Jade Emperor's Palace!

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.084
Everyone wants to be a god

01:25:32.251 --> 01:25:34.084
But then what?

01:25:34.334 --> 01:25:37.459
Every time I'm shamed, I tell myself that

01:25:37.792 --> 01:25:41.042
One day, I'll turn all of this upside down!

01:25:41.959 --> 01:25:45.001
So you tempted the Demon King
to take human spirits

01:25:45.292 --> 01:25:47.959
And you used me to steal the Dark Crystal

01:25:48.417 --> 01:25:52.459
You've caused cosmic chaos and annihilated humans
and demons without regret

01:25:52.626 --> 01:25:55.834
All this, just for ambition?

01:25:58.042 --> 01:26:01.376
I will tell the people of Hu the truth!

01:26:02.834 --> 01:26:04.334
And who would believe you?

01:26:06.042 --> 01:26:10.459
Zhong Kui, you're just a convenient pawn

01:26:11.042 --> 01:26:12.709
You are nothing

01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:16.959
Back then, you couldn't reincarnate
because you reeked of resentment

01:26:18.417 --> 01:26:20.042
Not because your will was strong

01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:22.542
I made all that up to fool you

01:26:22.834 --> 01:26:26.876
You don't have a soul, and I'm the one
keeping your spirits intact

01:26:44.001 --> 01:26:47.667
Tomorrow... after the Dark Crystal is opened

01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:51.542
All the people's spirits will be taken from them

01:26:52.626 --> 01:26:55.501
Earth will become a land of the walking dead

01:26:56.084 --> 01:26:58.792
It'll be the greatest crime in human history

01:27:00.376 --> 01:27:02.626
And I became your accomplice...

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:06.251
To achieve greatness, there will always
be collateral damage

01:27:08.834 --> 01:27:10.709
Do you really want to be my enemy?

01:27:11.417 --> 01:27:13.542
I've been preparing for this banquet
for a thousand years

01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:16.917
Just one more day... and no one shall
sabotage my work!

01:27:17.126 --> 01:27:21.542
You... are the biggest demon of all!

01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:23.126
Get out!

01:27:23.292 --> 01:27:27.251
You are no longer my pupil!

01:27:47.251 --> 01:27:49.167
It's Zhong Kui! What is he doing back here?

01:27:52.084 --> 01:27:54.417
Stay away from him! Lover of vile demons!

01:27:59.084 --> 01:28:00.667
Brother!

01:28:01.126 --> 01:28:02.459
Brother!

01:28:03.751 --> 01:28:06.126
Brother, what are you doing back here?
You must run

01:28:06.167 --> 01:28:07.167
They'll come for you

01:28:07.209 --> 01:28:09.751
What are you doing following him? Go away!

01:28:12.417 --> 01:28:13.709
Move! Move!

01:28:13.917 --> 01:28:15.251
Brother!

01:28:16.126 --> 01:28:17.376
Move!

01:28:25.959 --> 01:28:29.292
We've both been waiting for midnight

01:28:30.334 --> 01:28:35.292
Waiting for the moment our lost spirits
will return to us

01:28:35.834 --> 01:28:39.126
Waiting for Hell to vanish, for peace on Earth

01:28:39.417 --> 01:28:41.667
But it's all a lie!

01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:44.292
Zhong Kui, have you gone mad?!?
Don't talk nonsense!

01:28:45.126 --> 01:28:47.292
This has been Zhang Daoxian's scheme all along!

01:28:47.292 --> 01:28:48.626
Your words are poison!

01:28:48.792 --> 01:28:51.834
Zhong Kui, don't force us to draw our swords

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:54.751
Your words are poison! Brother
would never lie to you

01:28:54.792 --> 01:28:59.751
This is the moment Zhang Daoxian's
been so hungry for

01:28:59.792 --> 01:29:02.126
At midnight he will seize our spirits

01:29:02.376 --> 01:29:05.167
Our great city will turn into a purgatory

01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:06.709
Liar! Liar!

01:29:07.167 --> 01:29:12.167
And all of us will turn into demons!

01:29:16.917 --> 01:29:19.001
Master!

01:29:22.334 --> 01:29:24.376
Don't you kneel to him!

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:25.709
Du Ping!

01:29:25.751 --> 01:29:26.834
Get up!

01:29:26.834 --> 01:29:31.167
Don't you bow to him! No bowing!

01:29:31.334 --> 01:29:34.834
He is the monster! He's been lying to us!

01:29:35.001 --> 01:29:37.334
He doesn't want us to get our spirits back!

01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:41.626
We'll all turn into demons at midnight!

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:43.084
Do you believe him?

01:29:43.126 --> 01:29:44.709
No!

01:29:44.751 --> 01:29:47.084
Everyone, take a good look at Zhong Kui

01:29:47.501 --> 01:29:49.209
Look at him

01:29:50.584 --> 01:29:54.751
Zhong Kui, aren't you exhausted from
holding onto that human skin?

01:29:55.292 --> 01:29:57.876
Why don't you show us your true form?

01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:47.834
Stop! Don't hit my brother! Stop it!

01:30:47.876 --> 01:30:50.542
Hit him! Hit him!

01:30:55.001 --> 01:30:58.251
Don't hurt my brother!

01:31:00.417 --> 01:31:02.251
Don't hurt my brother!

01:31:02.834 --> 01:31:04.584
Hit him!

01:31:10.626 --> 01:31:12.167
Protect the Master!

01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:18.959
Zhong Kui, what are you waiting for?
Show your true form!

01:31:19.626 --> 01:31:22.167
Why don't you attack us in your demon form?

01:31:31.334 --> 01:31:33.334
Demon!

01:31:36.542 --> 01:31:39.417
Beat that demon! Beat it!

01:31:56.542 --> 01:31:58.751
Zhong Kui has turned into a demon!

01:31:59.167 --> 01:32:03.209
My brother is not a demon... He IS Zhong Kui...

01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:05.501
Kill him!

01:32:55.876 --> 01:32:57.459
Zhong Kui...

01:33:07.542 --> 01:33:09.126
Zhong Kui!

01:35:06.209 --> 01:35:09.376
I'm nothing more than a lost soul,
used like a pawn for three years

01:35:13.667 --> 01:35:15.667
It doesn't matter whether you're human or demon...

01:35:20.876 --> 01:35:23.209
You didn't do anything wrong

01:35:29.667 --> 01:35:31.667
You want to go back to Hu?

01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:40.959
Tonight will be the final battle

01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:58.042
Wherever you go

01:36:01.792 --> 01:36:03.251
I'll be by your side

01:36:45.792 --> 01:36:47.459
"The mysteries of Heaven and Earth..."

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:49.209
"The never-ending spiritual practice..."

01:36:49.251 --> 01:36:50.792
"The three realms and beyond..."

01:36:50.959 --> 01:36:53.001
"The gold light shining from above..."

01:36:53.959 --> 01:36:55.376
"The invisible Tao..."

01:36:55.417 --> 01:36:57.459
"That which governs heaven and earth..."

01:37:02.667 --> 01:37:05.376
"Keep reciting..."

01:37:05.834 --> 01:37:09.417
"Your senses and spirit will benefit..."

01:37:26.376 --> 01:37:29.959
Du Ping, do you believe all this?

01:37:30.417 --> 01:37:31.792
I can't trust him

01:37:34.876 --> 01:37:38.001
"Demons and monsters will tremble
with fear and scamper..."

01:37:48.334 --> 01:37:49.584
Bold

01:37:49.751 --> 01:37:51.501
I'm here for the Dark Crystal

01:37:51.876 --> 01:37:53.251
Vile creature

01:37:53.751 --> 01:37:55.626
A god who doesn't cultivate
his spiritual character

01:37:55.917 --> 01:37:58.459
But instead deceives the whole world
and destroys mine

01:37:59.417 --> 01:38:01.834
You saved Zhong Kui just to use him

01:38:02.667 --> 01:38:04.626
You false god!

01:38:04.834 --> 01:38:06.001
Die!

01:39:03.584 --> 01:39:05.876
I'm not here to fight my brothers

01:39:52.084 --> 01:39:54.126
I don't want to kill anyone

01:39:56.834 --> 01:39:58.001
Move!

01:42:08.126 --> 01:42:12.042
"Demons will tremble with fear..."

01:42:27.542 --> 01:42:29.459
I have sealed her up

01:42:30.126 --> 01:42:33.167
Nothing will ever tempt you again

01:42:34.459 --> 01:42:36.709
A great hero falling for a demon

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:39.667
You're no exception, even you

01:42:41.917 --> 01:42:46.001
Is "love" so mesmerizing?

01:44:51.792 --> 01:44:53.417
Is it worth it?

01:45:11.959 --> 01:45:15.292
Forever... and always...

01:45:18.084 --> 01:45:19.876
... worth it

01:49:13.459 --> 01:49:17.834
Zhong Kui, "Be calm and focused,
and you shall gain true wisdom"

01:49:18.126 --> 01:49:21.709
None of your demon forms represent
your true nature

01:49:22.167 --> 01:49:26.501
Go, reincarnate. We need you up in Heaven

01:49:27.305 --> 01:49:33.945
