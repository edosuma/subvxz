Sleepaway is an alternate

by our servers

14:16.730 --> 14:18.482

15:11.410 --> 15:12.953
Yes, you are a man.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.498
Your life and all its specifics
were put together

15:16.582 --> 15:19.376

Lowell, and then further shaped

15:19.460 --> 15:21.879

how come I don't remember
any of that?

15:35.267 --> 15:37.978
Truth is,
you synced up to Sleepaway

15:38.062 --> 15:40.189
last night at your house
around 11:15.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.733
You played for a few hours,
and then you had a...

15:46.945 --> 15:49.406
-(heart beating loudly)

15:52.117 --> 15:53.160
What?

15:53.243 --> 15:55.913
Phineas is still unconscious.
He's being looked after

15:55.996 --> 15:57.956
and monitored,
but he's still synced up.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.458
To be honest, we don't even know

15:59.541 --> 16:01.710
if or how much of him
is still inside of you.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.880
None of him, okay? Zero percent.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.298
I think what
we're gonna have to do

16:06.382 --> 16:08.217
is perform a force-unsync
from this end.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.386
Whoa, whoa. F-Force-unsync.
What does that mean?

16:10.469 --> 16:11.929

this the best

16:12.012 --> 16:13.931

-Best for whom?

16:14.014 --> 16:15.474

16:17.101 --> 16:18.936
Don't look at him! Look at me.

-Well, sir...
-"Sir"?

"Don't break it."

19:34.339 --> 19:35.924

19:39.177 --> 19:43.015
It's the first thing
you ever said to me.

19:43.098 --> 19:48.270
We were at an-an antique shop by
the beach up by where I grew up

19:48.353 --> 19:51.815
and... I was looking at a lamp

19:51.899 --> 19:55.485
and when I went to touch it,
it just, it cracked in my hands.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.279
(laughs softly)

19:57.362 --> 20:01.783
And we were the only ones
who heard it.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.619
And you mouthed to me,

20:03.702 --> 20:06.288
(whispers):
"Don't break it."

20:07.539 --> 20:09.791
Five years later we were sitting

20:09.875 --> 20:14.254
in a park kind of like this one
but in the real world,

20:14.338 --> 20:18.133
when you got down on one knee

20:18.216 --> 20:23.972
and you pointed at your heart
and you said...

20:24.056 --> 20:26.475
BOTH:
"Don't break it."

20:26.558 --> 20:29.019
"Don't break it." Yeah.

20:35.275 --> 20:40.155

20:44.743 --> 20:46.954

20:50.999 --> 20:55.337
Listen, this is serious, Phin.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.967
If you don't unsync soon,
Downtime will end, and...

21:00.759 --> 21:02.928
...you'll be gone forever.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.251

how to get out.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.503
-He's not in here.
-How...

21:36.586 --> 21:37.879
How do you know that?

21:37.963 --> 21:40.882
We have been married

That's all they were trying
to do-- we're all trying

27:42.869 --> 27:46.456
(chuckles): to help with this...
truly unforeseen error.

27:46.539 --> 27:47.582
-Error?
-Yeah.

27:47.665 --> 27:48.708
Is that what
you're calling it now?

27:48.792 --> 27:52.128
Yeah, we've had an embarrassing
amount of issues for us.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.131
{\an8}Some mapping inconsistencies
downtown that had people

27:55.215 --> 27:57.050
{\an8}entering a Laundromat
and exiting a manhole

27:57.133 --> 27:59.803
{\an8}(chuckles):
on the other side of town.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.805
And then there was you.

28:01.888 --> 28:04.766
And we're still not quite sure
what happened with you,

28:04.849 --> 28:07.477
but we're-we're trying to be
very, very careful.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.895
{\an8}But...

28:08.978 --> 28:11.815
{\an8}um, Downtime is almost over,
and players

28:11.898 --> 28:14.651
{\an8}are gonna start logging back in,
and the game's gonna begin

28:14.734 --> 28:16.986
{\an8}for millions of people
around the world.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.577
(Michelle sighs)

28:24.661 --> 28:26.454
Listen, um...

28:26.538 --> 28:27.956
if-if you want to stay

28:28.039 --> 28:31.084
and continue as Michelle,
that is...

28:31.167 --> 28:33.586
that is 100% fine with us,
absolutely.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.840
We just ask
that you sign this form

28:36.923 --> 28:40.176
clearing us of responsibility.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.012
-Let me just get this.
-Just like that, huh?

28:43.096 --> 28:46.141
{\an5}-Sorry?
-Just gonna sweep old Phineas
under the rug?

28:46.224 --> 28:47.976
Don't... please don't think
of it like that.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.519
Phineas's family is
completely taken care of.

28:49.602 --> 28:50.478
I'm gonna wake up.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.730
{\an5}-Okay.
-Just-- How could I stay
in a world

28:52.814 --> 28:54.149
that I know isn't real?

28:54.232 --> 28:54.858
I am not real.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.901
Phineas is real.
Ellen is real.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.611
I don't know shit
about their lives,

28:58.695 --> 29:00.822
but I feel like
it's worth giving it a shot.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.949
You need to forget
about Phineas.

29:03.032 --> 29:05.201
Forget? How can I forget?

29:05.285 --> 29:07.871
Since this orb showed up,
all anybody's been telling me

29:07.954 --> 29:10.665
-is how I am not real and he is.
-It wasn't just a heart attack.

29:10.748 --> 29:12.876
He drank
a sleeping pill smoothie

29:12.959 --> 29:14.961
before syncing up one last time.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.547
Phineas was taken off
life support 45 minutes ago.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.841
He passed a few minutes later.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.343
If you log out,
there's nothing to go back to.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.345
There's no Phineas.

29:24.429 --> 29:27.056
But I think I can feel him now.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.351
Stay here.
You can run this hotel.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.811
You can go back to normal.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.063
{\an8}Okay? All you got to do is
just play the game.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.403
Thank you.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.405
Please remember the one rule:

29:42.489 --> 29:44.741
Don't break character.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.828
You have until the end
of Downtime to log out.

Of course, that's up to you.
