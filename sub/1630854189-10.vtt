WEBVTT

00:03.062 --> 00:04.169
-Hi.
-KAT: Hi!

00:04.321 --> 00:05.838
Um, can I get
two blueberry muffins,

00:05.989 --> 00:07.247
one banana, one chocolate chip?

00:07.399 --> 00:11.068
Actually, our regular baker Phil
is on vacation,

00:11.161 --> 00:13.012
so we don't have
our usual variety.

00:13.180 --> 00:17.165
We do, however, have
our usual variety of smiles.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.000
There's a Starbucks
on the corner.

00:19.020 --> 00:22.079
You can order on your phone
and talk to no one.

00:22.097 --> 00:24.523
Uh, what kinds of muffins
do you have?

00:25.842 --> 00:27.509
Uh... brown?

00:27.528 --> 00:30.437
All right,
I'll take four brown muffins.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.179
Oh, great!

00:31.273 --> 00:33.014
Regular or extra crispy?

00:33.092 --> 00:35.850
Trick question,
because we only have one kind

00:35.870 --> 00:37.594
and it's not the one you want.

00:37.613 --> 00:40.622
You can literally see
the Starbucks from here.

00:41.691 --> 00:42.708
Thanks a lot, Mother.

00:42.785 --> 00:43.709
Here.

00:43.786 --> 00:45.026
Don't break a tooth.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.621
Oh, look! Phil just sent me
some pictures

00:47.773 --> 00:50.274
-of him and Jalen in Tahiti!
-Oh!
-Ooh!

00:50.367 --> 00:52.200
Look how happy they are.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.701
Lying on the beach,

00:53.796 --> 00:55.370
tropical drinks in their hands.

00:55.389 --> 00:59.707
Well, at least we still have
January in Kentucky.

00:59.727 --> 01:03.120
WOMAN:
You go ahead
and write me that ticket!

01:03.138 --> 01:04.712
I'm-a file it in the trash,

01:04.732 --> 01:08.734
right next to my jury summons
and my tax bill!

01:11.054 --> 01:13.072
Hey. What y'all doin'?

01:13.299 --> 01:15.890
Uh, hi.
Uh, I'm just living my...

01:15.984 --> 01:17.467
Oh, shut your smile hole.

01:17.486 --> 01:20.579
Now, I'm gonna need an apron,
directions to the kitchen

01:20.806 --> 01:22.322
and, after my coffee kicks in,

01:22.474 --> 01:24.899
I'm gonna need about ten minutes
in the bathroom

01:24.919 --> 01:26.734
by myself.

01:26.829 --> 01:27.920
Um, uh, uh,

01:28.071 --> 01:29.588
wh-who exactly are you?

01:29.665 --> 01:30.905
Lurlene Crumpler.

01:30.999 --> 01:32.240
Phil's mama!

01:32.259 --> 01:33.834
Wow!

01:34.002 --> 01:35.986
It is so nice to meet you!

01:36.079 --> 01:39.080
But, um, I'm confused--
why do you need an apron?

01:39.174 --> 01:40.841
My Phil is on vacation.

01:40.935 --> 01:44.511
It's Crumpler custom to do his
work for him while he's gone.

01:44.663 --> 01:46.421
I do it for all my kin.

01:46.590 --> 01:50.025
Shoot, that's how I learnt
to dance on a pole.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.945
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

01:53.172 --> 01:55.948
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

01:56.175 --> 01:57.616
All right, y'all!

01:57.767 --> 01:58.892
Here we go!

01:58.953 --> 02:00.677
Who's ready for a muffin?

02:00.770 --> 02:03.029
I've got butter, buttercream,

02:03.124 --> 02:04.681
butter-free and possum.

02:04.774 --> 02:06.350
(chuckles):
I'm just kidding.

02:06.368 --> 02:07.942
There ain't no butter-free.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.128
-MAX: Uh...
-(chuckles)

02:09.355 --> 02:10.354
(inhales)

02:10.447 --> 02:12.614
Wow, these smell amazing,
Mrs. Crumpler,

02:12.633 --> 02:16.193
but I'm kind of on
a gluten reset right now.

02:17.045 --> 02:18.637
-Yeah, I'll take a buttercream.
-(Kat chuckles)

02:18.788 --> 02:21.122
-You're damn right you will,
string bean.
-Mm.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.958
None of you look like
you've eaten since July.

02:24.052 --> 02:25.886
Except for this sturdy one.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.220
When the world goes to hell,

02:27.373 --> 02:30.149
we keep you around
to pull the plow.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.600
Oh, my gosh.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.135
These are amazing. Our customers
are gonna love these.

02:34.229 --> 02:35.988
No kidding.
These are better than sex.

02:36.139 --> 02:38.240
And look who I have sex with.

02:39.309 --> 02:41.326
-What's your secret?
-Uh-uh.

02:41.478 --> 02:44.554
My Phil always says, "Never ask
a Crumpler for a recipe,

02:44.573 --> 02:48.058
their address or what side
of the war they fought on."

02:48.227 --> 02:50.727
We might be eating
Confederate muffins.

02:50.896 --> 02:54.247
I don't give a damn. If you
don't want yours, I'll take it.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.232
(cat meows)

02:55.325 --> 02:57.083
What is with all these cats?

02:57.236 --> 02:58.493
-Do y'all have a rat problem?
-(chuckles)

02:58.587 --> 03:01.238
You know, it's a good thing
I brought my indoor gun.

03:01.256 --> 03:03.757
Oh, no, Mrs. Crumpler,
uh, no guns.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.184
We're a rescue café.

03:05.335 --> 03:07.077
The cats are here
because we love them.

03:07.095 --> 03:08.503
Actually...

03:08.522 --> 03:09.429
Eh.

03:09.581 --> 03:11.005
Shoot 'em, Lurlene.

03:11.099 --> 03:13.934
You know,
y'all can call me "Mama,"

03:14.086 --> 03:16.753
just like
my little Philliam does.

03:16.772 --> 03:17.587
Philliam?

03:17.606 --> 03:18.864
Well, that's his given name.

03:19.091 --> 03:20.607
It was supposed to be William,

03:20.743 --> 03:22.034
but his daddy was pretty drunk

03:22.261 --> 03:24.018
when he filled out
the birth certificate.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.853
Been there.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.431
So, Abercrombie and Fitch,

03:27.449 --> 03:30.100
I'm gonna need some help
on my farm while I'm gone.

03:30.193 --> 03:31.435
Y'all know anything
about animals?

03:31.528 --> 03:33.861
I know about animals
'cause I run a bar,

03:33.881 --> 03:34.862
so... (laughs)

03:35.031 --> 03:37.090
I'm kinda the funny one here.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.219
-(chickens clucking)
-(horse neighs in distance)

03:40.446 --> 03:42.779
All right, so we have, uh,

03:42.948 --> 03:45.282
Barbra and... Liza.

03:45.342 --> 03:48.227
-I'm guessing Phil named them.
-Mm-hmm.

03:48.378 --> 03:51.396
So, Mama says we need
to feed 'em and milk 'em.

03:51.548 --> 03:54.215
All right.
I'll feed 'em, you milk 'em.

03:54.309 --> 03:55.792
So, what do you think they eat?

03:55.811 --> 03:58.886
According to the Chick-fil-A
signs, they like chicken.

03:58.964 --> 03:59.980
(chuckles)

04:00.132 --> 04:01.406
Howdy, Liza.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.225
I'm going to need
your verbal consent

04:04.319 --> 04:06.136
before I milk your teats.

04:06.305 --> 04:07.895
(Liza moos)

04:07.915 --> 04:09.581
All right, let's party.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.583
Okay, seriously,

04:11.810 --> 04:12.492
what do cows eat?

04:12.644 --> 04:13.493
-Hay.
-What?

04:13.645 --> 04:14.494
That's what they eat.

04:14.646 --> 04:15.812
-What?
-Hay.

04:15.831 --> 04:17.071
Fine. If you don't want
to tell me,

04:17.165 --> 04:19.216
I'm-a just feed 'em this grass.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.578
Now, I assume this one's
chocolate, this one's vanilla

04:23.597 --> 04:25.246
and this one's strawberry.

04:25.266 --> 04:28.008
Ooh, I hope
the last one is swirl.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.009
Check it out!

04:29.085 --> 04:30.827
Got milk?

04:30.920 --> 04:33.021
(laughs)

04:34.924 --> 04:35.999
Hold on.

04:36.018 --> 04:37.943
Is there something wrong
with your mouth?

04:38.170 --> 04:39.836
There must be,

04:39.855 --> 04:41.780
because I know there's
nothing wrong with this muffin.

04:41.931 --> 04:43.356
Oh, it's good. I'm just full.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.525
This muffin was made
with a mama's love.

04:45.677 --> 04:49.179
You either eat it or I'm-a shove
it into your stomach myself.

04:49.197 --> 04:51.272
And I can go
from top or bottom--

04:51.366 --> 04:52.499
your choice.

04:53.610 --> 04:55.585
I would choose top.

04:59.191 --> 05:00.281
Hey, what are you doing?

05:00.375 --> 05:02.876
You have been sitting here
for two hours

05:02.970 --> 05:05.028
with one damn cup of coffee.

05:05.047 --> 05:06.471
You take your porn elsewhere.

05:06.698 --> 05:08.031
This isn't the library.

05:08.050 --> 05:09.308
Go on! Get!

05:09.493 --> 05:10.867
I'm very sorry.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.311
Uh, Mama,

05:12.462 --> 05:14.554
we try really hard not to yell
at our customers,

05:14.706 --> 05:17.541
especially like the good
Reverend Johnson here.

05:17.634 --> 05:18.800
You have a blessed day.

05:19.711 --> 05:23.213
I am 79 years old, and I got
a damn plate in my head.

05:23.306 --> 05:24.823
I can yell whenever I want.

05:24.974 --> 05:26.399
Well, I think
that's what we're trying...

05:26.493 --> 05:29.069
Whenever I want!

05:29.830 --> 05:32.998
Okay. I've never seen
<i> Throw Momma from the Train,</i>

05:33.149 --> 05:34.816
but it does give me an idea.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.318
Look, we just need to get
through the next half hour.

05:37.412 --> 05:40.339
Then she'll go back to the farm
and we'll close the shop,

05:40.490 --> 05:42.174
burn it to the ground,
collect the insurance money,

05:42.325 --> 05:43.567
buy a van, get a big dog

05:43.660 --> 05:45.418
and drive around town
solving mysteries.

05:45.571 --> 05:47.420
Ruh-roh, Randi.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.348
Yeah,
because that's so much better

05:49.575 --> 05:51.165
than telling her
not to come back tomorrow.

05:51.259 --> 05:53.243
Well, what's your plan,
Black Velma?

05:53.261 --> 05:54.519
No, I like your plan.

05:54.671 --> 05:56.605
Girl, I have matches on me.

05:57.599 --> 05:58.506
Oh, yes.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.674
Oh, uh,

05:59.768 --> 06:01.918
Mama, you don't need
to take the trash out.

06:02.011 --> 06:03.103
This isn't trash.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.680
This is my luggage.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.014
L-Luggage?

06:07.109 --> 06:08.182
For what?

06:08.276 --> 06:10.610
I'm here for the duration,
sweetie.

06:10.762 --> 06:13.038
-These go up to your place,
right?
-(Randi laughs)

06:13.265 --> 06:14.431
Sure do, Mama!

06:14.449 --> 06:16.524
Uh, uh, hang on.
You're-you're staying with me?

06:16.543 --> 06:20.270
I guess I-I just assumed you,
like, drove your house here.

06:20.288 --> 06:23.123
I am your fellow hunker-downer.

06:23.199 --> 06:24.716
Now, I don't mind sharing a bed,

06:24.868 --> 06:28.128
but I do sleep naked and my
alarm goes off at first light.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.222
-(rooster crows)
-Whoa!
-Oh.

06:30.373 --> 06:33.258
Settle down, Rufus.
We're city folk now.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.519
♪ ♪

06:39.958 --> 06:41.691
(keys jangling, turning in lock)

06:45.497 --> 06:46.146
Kat?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.814
What are you doing down here?

06:47.966 --> 06:48.890
(Rufus crowing)

06:48.984 --> 06:50.467
What the heck?

06:51.227 --> 06:53.245
(chuckles): Oh.
Oh, you think that's funny, huh?

06:53.321 --> 06:55.305
Well, we'll see who's laughing
when you're on my plate

06:55.307 --> 06:57.532
with mashed potatoes
and a biscuit!

06:58.735 --> 07:02.570
I couldn't sleep. Between Rufus
crowing at 4:00 a.m. and...

07:02.589 --> 07:06.416
trying to ignore Mama's
spicy dream about Ronald Reagan.

07:07.486 --> 07:09.911
Well, if it isn't
the morning meeting

07:09.930 --> 07:11.930
of the Dim and Lazy Club.

07:12.081 --> 07:14.582
No wonder
my Phil needed a vacation--

07:14.676 --> 07:16.826
he was doing all the work
around here.

07:16.845 --> 07:17.978
Are you kidding?

07:18.129 --> 07:19.271
Phil takes so many naps,

07:19.498 --> 07:21.273
we thought
this place had a gas leak.

07:21.424 --> 07:23.257
Are you calling my Phil a liar?

07:23.426 --> 07:26.111
Because the last person
that did that is missing an ear.

07:26.262 --> 07:27.946
That was from the war
and is totally unrelated,

07:28.115 --> 07:30.282
but we don't talk to him
no more.

07:31.434 --> 07:33.434
Okay, can we take a moment
to appreciate

07:33.454 --> 07:35.937
that Phil's mama
is actually twice as crazy

07:36.031 --> 07:37.363
as Phil made her out to be?

07:37.516 --> 07:38.348
I know.

07:38.366 --> 07:40.200
I guess he was protecting her.

07:40.352 --> 07:43.203
Like a little pit bull
in a sequined jacket.

07:43.355 --> 07:45.279
MAMA:
Dagnabbit!

07:45.299 --> 07:48.708
Which one of you morons
bought salted butter?!

07:48.860 --> 07:50.026
That was Randi!

07:50.028 --> 07:51.695
Also, she hates Ronald Reagan!

07:51.788 --> 07:52.804
Wha...

07:52.956 --> 07:54.139
Okay, this is ridiculous.

07:54.366 --> 07:55.699
One of us needs to go in there

07:55.717 --> 07:57.050
and tell her
that we don't want her here.

07:57.202 --> 07:58.810
Yes. You're absolutely right.

07:59.037 --> 08:01.371
I'm gonna go upstairs,
I'm gonna get dressed

08:01.464 --> 08:03.373
and then I'm gonna
come down here like a badass

08:03.391 --> 08:05.466
and fire an elderly volunteer.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.468
You're about to go hide
in your bed, aren't you?

08:07.488 --> 08:10.380
Yes, because badasses need naps,
too!

08:10.398 --> 08:11.806
(crowing)

08:11.900 --> 08:13.325
Shut up, Rufus!

08:14.328 --> 08:16.386
-(chickens clucking)
-(horse neighs)

08:16.404 --> 08:18.404
Holy cow!

08:19.166 --> 08:21.291
Sorry if that's offensive
to you, ladies.

08:22.318 --> 08:25.003
Carter, check this out.

08:26.565 --> 08:27.172
Oh, damn.

08:27.323 --> 08:29.341
Is that Phil? He's jacked!

08:29.568 --> 08:32.902
Looks like Freddie Mercury
and Super Mario had a baby.

08:32.921 --> 08:35.088
(chuckles) Hey,
I'm as straight as they come,

08:35.240 --> 08:36.906
but if this dude
bought me a drink,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.165
-I don't know.
-(chuckles)

08:38.334 --> 08:41.002
I mean, he's four-foot-11
and all badass.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.336
Well, I mean, think about it.

08:42.430 --> 08:44.130
Growing up gay, around here,

08:44.191 --> 08:45.765
-he'd have to be.
-Yeah.

08:45.917 --> 08:48.918
This one time, this guy
was picking on him in the bar.

08:48.937 --> 08:50.344
Phil threw rosé in his face,

08:50.364 --> 08:51.530
punched him right
in the belly button

08:51.757 --> 08:53.089
and called him
his Pillsbury Dough Bitch.

08:53.108 --> 08:54.866
(laughs)
I remember that!

08:55.093 --> 08:57.035
Yeah! And then he stood
over him and he said,

08:57.262 --> 08:58.762
"You mess with the bull,

08:58.780 --> 09:00.413
"you get me horny.

09:00.599 --> 09:02.949
-No, wait, that ain't it."
-(laughing)

09:03.101 --> 09:04.434
(mooing)

09:04.452 --> 09:06.878
Settle down, Babs.
Same old story--

09:07.030 --> 09:10.031
the ladies are buying
what Carter is selling.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.049
(mooing)

09:11.200 --> 09:12.942
What's going on, Babs?

09:13.628 --> 09:15.369
-Wow, you didn't eat very much.
-Who can blame her?

09:15.463 --> 09:17.038
Why would anybody want
to eat that...

09:17.057 --> 09:18.114
-Oh, God!
-What?

09:18.133 --> 09:19.616
-What?
-Th-Th-Th...

09:19.618 --> 09:22.285
There's something coming out
of this cow!

09:22.378 --> 09:23.303
Oh! Aah!

09:23.397 --> 09:24.712
-I think she's giving birth!
-(scoffs)

09:24.731 --> 09:27.457
Are you sure?! 'Cause if this
is some alien BS,

09:27.459 --> 09:30.235
I'm getting ready
to get the hell up out of here!

09:33.056 --> 09:35.240
Oh, Lurlene, this is delicious.

09:35.467 --> 09:38.243
I don't even have to put
any booze in it.

09:38.394 --> 09:41.496
I mean, I'm going to,
of course, but...

09:42.324 --> 09:44.065
It tastes like cake batter.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.141
What's in it?

09:45.160 --> 09:46.585
Cake batter.

09:46.736 --> 09:49.479
I used to fix that for Phil
to help him grow.

09:49.614 --> 09:53.483
Didn't make him any taller, but
it sure made him love me more.

09:53.501 --> 09:55.093
(chuckles)
Mother wanted me to grow, too,

09:55.244 --> 09:56.243
but instead of cake batter,

09:56.338 --> 09:58.822
she used pointed criticism.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.007
Hey, hey, hey.
You don't ever sass your mama.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.101
Sheila,
you want a hittin' spoon?

10:03.328 --> 10:05.103
I like these metal ones.
Them wooden ones

10:05.254 --> 10:06.938
-can snap on you.
-SHEILA: Oh.

10:07.165 --> 10:09.165
No, thank you, Lurlene. I...

10:09.184 --> 10:12.185
Well, let me feel
the weight on it.

10:12.337 --> 10:13.945
Um...

10:14.097 --> 10:15.188
Uh, Kat,

10:15.340 --> 10:17.023
there's a situation
in the kitchen.

10:17.175 --> 10:18.232
-What's going on?
-Uh, well,

10:18.343 --> 10:20.844
it seems a squirrel
is taking a nap.

10:20.937 --> 10:21.936
In a pan.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.363
In the oven.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.957
And I'm not gonna lie--
it smells pretty good.

10:26.109 --> 10:28.109
Okay, that's it. Uh, Lurlene,

10:28.128 --> 10:30.186
Randi and I have to talk to you
about something.

10:30.279 --> 10:31.855
Well, quit your lollygagging.

10:31.948 --> 10:34.299
I got to get back in the kitchen
and do me a butter stomp.

10:34.526 --> 10:36.784
Reminds me of Phil.
I just love him the best

10:36.803 --> 10:41.222
when that butter is squishing up
between them little piggies.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.716
Okay. Um...

10:43.869 --> 10:47.461
Mama, we appreciate
everything you have done...

10:47.555 --> 10:51.090
I'm sorry, are you saying
you step<i> on</i> the butter?

10:51.242 --> 10:52.392
Oh, honey, I told you

10:52.544 --> 10:55.545
there's a little bit of me
in everything I make.

10:55.563 --> 10:56.303
(chuckles weakly)

10:56.323 --> 10:57.822
I thought you meant love,

10:57.974 --> 10:59.549
not DNA.

10:59.642 --> 11:00.383
Uh, listen,

11:00.402 --> 11:02.994
maybe tonight, after work,

11:03.146 --> 11:04.311
you should go home

11:04.331 --> 11:06.072
and, um...

11:06.224 --> 11:06.998
stay there.

11:07.225 --> 11:08.833
(chuckles):
No.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.576
No?

11:10.729 --> 11:12.045
No.

11:12.839 --> 11:13.821
O-Okay.

11:13.915 --> 11:15.322
All right. Good talk.

11:15.417 --> 11:16.582
I'll see you tonight, roomie!

11:16.735 --> 11:18.084
This time I'm the big spoon!

11:18.236 --> 11:19.761
(laughs)
It's...

11:21.848 --> 11:22.997
-That was sad.
-(sighs)

11:23.166 --> 11:24.574
You want me to get rid of her?

11:24.667 --> 11:25.925
I thought you liked her.

11:26.077 --> 11:27.243
I do.

11:27.336 --> 11:30.188
I just genuinely enjoy
firing people.

11:30.339 --> 11:32.357
Why do you think
we went through so many nannies?

11:32.434 --> 11:34.584
You said they quit
to get away from me.

11:34.602 --> 11:37.570
Oh. (laughs)
I did say that, didn't I?

11:38.773 --> 11:40.532
Watch and learn.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.926
Okay, Randi, come on.

11:42.944 --> 11:44.185
Randi.

11:44.279 --> 11:46.854
Mm-mm. There is
a crazy old white woman in there

11:46.873 --> 11:48.114
cooking an animal from the park.

11:48.266 --> 11:50.250
Y'all go ahead.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.272
Damn, Sheila, you<i> are</i> good.

11:56.365 --> 11:58.717
I just got off the phone
with Phil.

11:58.868 --> 12:01.386
He and Jalen
are staying in Tahiti.

12:01.463 --> 12:02.703
What?

12:02.797 --> 12:06.966
They're gonna open a bakery
and get boy-married.

12:07.135 --> 12:09.543
Wait, I-I-I can't believe this.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.545
Phil's not coming back?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.690
No.

12:16.811 --> 12:18.903
Also, you're fired.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.221
Mother!

12:20.298 --> 12:22.741
Sorry. I thought
it would cheer me up.

12:31.993 --> 12:34.477
So I guess Phil and Jalen,

12:34.570 --> 12:37.480
they found a bakery for sale
down there in Tahiti and...

12:37.573 --> 12:39.907
they got to talking
about how nice it would be

12:39.926 --> 12:41.259
to stay there forever.

12:41.486 --> 12:45.579
Why can't they just go to Miami
like regular gays?

12:46.341 --> 12:48.007
I just can't imagine
Phil getting married

12:48.176 --> 12:49.601
and us not being there.

12:49.752 --> 12:53.420
I mean, one of us might want
to sing "Islands in the Stream."

12:53.515 --> 12:56.924
I do both parts.
It's a real showstopper.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.094
I just can't believe
he's not coming back.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.338
Damn it,
he borrowed my suitcase.

13:02.431 --> 13:04.765
Well, I guess
the most important thing is

13:04.859 --> 13:07.343
-that Phil's happy
and he's in love.
-Mm-hmm.

13:07.362 --> 13:10.346
All any mother wants
is for her child to be happy.

13:10.515 --> 13:14.775
I mean, for Phil, it was moving
to Tahiti with Jalen.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.686
For Katharine, it's...

13:16.704 --> 13:20.523
what, finding a surprise
Fig Newton in your pocket?

13:20.542 --> 13:24.302
It wasn't a surprise.
I'd been saving it.

13:25.121 --> 13:26.304
Phil saw the whole thing.

13:26.531 --> 13:28.881
"It's a treat
you can fit in your pocket,

13:29.050 --> 13:31.351
just like me."

13:32.295 --> 13:34.062
I'm really gonna miss him.

13:35.557 --> 13:36.648
Me, too.

13:37.709 --> 13:41.319
I want y'all to know
how happy this place made him.

13:41.470 --> 13:44.397
You all accepted him
with no judgment.

13:44.566 --> 13:46.566
Shoot, he talks
about y'all so much,

13:46.660 --> 13:48.885
I feel like you're family.

13:48.903 --> 13:51.162
We feel like you're family, too.

13:51.981 --> 13:54.057
It's like Phil always says--

13:54.150 --> 13:56.559
family ain't who you're born to.

13:56.578 --> 13:58.744
ALL:
It's who'll lie to the cops
for you.

13:58.897 --> 14:00.171
(Randi chuckles)

14:00.323 --> 14:02.340
♪ ♪

14:03.234 --> 14:05.234
Well, do you know
of any other vet in the area

14:05.253 --> 14:06.493
who can get here today?

14:07.330 --> 14:08.754
Okay, well,
do you know if Instacart

14:08.849 --> 14:10.265
can deliver a cow baby?!

14:11.334 --> 14:13.409
-All right. Thanks.
-(loud mooing)

14:13.428 --> 14:15.928
Oh, man,
she does not sound happy.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.914
Though I guess if I was
pooping out a small cow,

14:18.007 --> 14:19.506
I'd be pretty cranky, too.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.861
All right. The doctor said if
it's not coming out on its own,

14:23.012 --> 14:24.178
one of us got to go up in there.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.013
What do you mean,
go up in there?

14:26.107 --> 14:26.939
You know.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.274
Go up in there.

14:28.426 --> 14:29.701
Oh, yeah.

14:29.928 --> 14:31.110
He said you should do it.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.445
Why me?!

14:32.539 --> 14:35.264
'Cause he said on the phone
my arms sounded short.

14:35.358 --> 14:36.782
-(mooing)
-You know what, screw it.

14:36.877 --> 14:41.028
All right. You grab on to the
legs and pull and I'm gonna...

14:41.047 --> 14:42.547
go up in there.

14:42.698 --> 14:44.273
-Okay.
-All right.

14:44.442 --> 14:45.866
Okay.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.444
-(groans) Oh.
-Oh. Oh, God.

14:48.537 --> 14:50.113
What do you feel?

14:50.131 --> 14:52.206
Mm, mostly regret.

14:53.134 --> 14:55.451
Oh, wait, no,
I think I felt it move.

14:55.470 --> 14:57.044
Whatever you're doing,
just do it again.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.821
(grunts)
That's what she said.

14:58.823 --> 15:00.306
(laughs)
Good one, dude. (chuckles)

15:00.383 --> 15:01.457
Keep pulling.

15:01.476 --> 15:03.401
-We almost got it.
-(grunting) Really?

15:03.628 --> 15:05.219
"We"? 'Cause,
last time I checked,

15:05.238 --> 15:07.630
I'm the only one wearing a cow
like a wristwatch.

15:07.799 --> 15:09.407
(grunting)

15:09.634 --> 15:11.242
-Keep going! We're...
-(strained): Oh, my God.

15:11.394 --> 15:13.077
-Aah! Oh! Oh!
-(laughing): Oh! Oh!

15:13.229 --> 15:15.638
-Oh! (laughing) Oh!
-(laughing) Oh!

15:15.731 --> 15:16.897
Oh! (laughs)
We did it!

15:16.991 --> 15:18.082
(chuckles)
We're parents!

15:18.251 --> 15:19.976
-(laughs)
-Look at him!

15:19.978 --> 15:21.920
-Oh, he's beautiful!
-(chuckling)

15:22.071 --> 15:23.496
-Oh. Oh, come here...
-(grunts)

15:23.648 --> 15:25.815
-Oh! Oh! He can walk!
-Oh! Oh!

15:25.833 --> 15:29.243
-(laughs) Hey, quick, we didn't
get video of his first steps.
-(chuckles)

15:29.262 --> 15:30.911
Get your camera.
I'll knock him down.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.155
(laughs)

15:32.173 --> 15:33.747
What should we name him?

15:33.841 --> 15:36.083
Maybe we should combine
our names.

15:36.177 --> 15:38.102
-Car-Max.
-(chuckles)

15:38.254 --> 15:39.420
No, no, look at him.

15:39.555 --> 15:42.106
He's small, fuzzy,
and getting kind of fresh.

15:42.333 --> 15:43.942
-He's Lil' Phil.
-(chuckles)

15:44.169 --> 15:45.109
Or Big Phil.

15:45.336 --> 15:47.278
Oh. No, that's just
his umbilical cord.

15:47.430 --> 15:48.529
(chuckles)

15:55.029 --> 15:56.120
I'm glad we went to the wedding,

15:56.272 --> 15:58.514
but 17 hours on a plane
was brutal.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.516
At least you weren't sitting
next to a crying baby

16:00.535 --> 16:01.775
the whole time.

16:01.869 --> 16:03.035
I couldn't help it.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.854
It was such a beautiful wedding.

16:04.947 --> 16:07.298
I just love love.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.208
All right, everyone.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.377
Wedding slideshow is done.

16:11.529 --> 16:12.595
Gather round.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.792
<i> KAT (on recording):</i>
<i> Phil, Jalen,</i>

16:18.961 --> 16:19.960
<i> looking at you,</i>

16:20.054 --> 16:21.204
<i> I see two hearts,</i>

16:21.297 --> 16:23.630
<i> two souls, two...</i>

16:23.650 --> 16:25.725
<i> islands in the stream.</i>

16:25.819 --> 16:28.611
-And audio muted.
-(Randi chuckles)

16:29.472 --> 16:30.713
Look at my Phil.

16:30.732 --> 16:33.049
Yeah, he and Jalen
just look so happy.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.659
Aw, it's their first dance.

16:34.810 --> 16:35.976
Yeah, I was really surprised

16:35.996 --> 16:37.644
when they did that lift
from<i> Dirty Dancing.</i>

16:37.664 --> 16:40.373
-I had the time of my life.
-(chuckles)

16:42.002 --> 16:44.485
Aw, Tahiti's so beautiful.

16:44.562 --> 16:46.912
I can understand why
they don't want to come home.

16:47.065 --> 16:48.414
Yeah, me, too.

16:48.566 --> 16:50.174
-Damn,
I'm really gonna miss him.
-(Sheila sighs)

16:50.401 --> 16:52.176
Like every time I sit in a chair

16:52.403 --> 16:54.328
and his hand
isn't "accidentally" there.

16:54.422 --> 16:56.014
(chuckles)

16:57.333 --> 16:59.575
This place won't be the same
without him.

16:59.668 --> 17:03.563
Kentucky won't be the same
without him.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.067
Nothing's gonna be the same
without him.

17:38.541 --> 17:40.783
What we've done here

17:40.876 --> 17:43.603
is we've given Phil
a happy ending.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.306
What we're really doing

17:47.458 --> 17:49.642
is mourning the loss
of our dear friend,

17:49.736 --> 17:51.444
Leslie Jordan.

17:52.388 --> 17:54.980
He is irreplaceable.

17:55.133 --> 17:57.325
We will miss him very much.

17:58.653 --> 17:59.893
Love.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.895
Light.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.082
ALL:

Now, that's some lines

18:34.263 --> 18:36.614
from the song
that you and I did together.

18:36.841 --> 18:38.432
I know usually, at a memorial,

18:38.451 --> 18:40.676
people talk<i> about</i> somebody.

18:40.695 --> 18:42.361
Well, I'm gonna talk to you.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.697
'Cause there is that place
on the other side,

18:44.849 --> 18:47.959
and I'm certainly gonna see you
there, little brother.

18:48.186 --> 18:50.202

18:50.355 --> 18:52.463
with a lot of precious,
precious memories.

18:52.540 --> 18:53.947
Everybody loved you.

18:54.041 --> 18:57.117
But I doubt that many of 'em
loved you more than I did.

18:57.211 --> 18:59.137
<i>Anyhow, I just want you to know</i>

18:59.364 --> 19:01.046
that we all love you,

19:01.199 --> 19:02.456
we all miss you

19:02.625 --> 19:04.383
and I bet
you're having a big laugh

19:04.535 --> 19:07.052
over all of us being sad
and sorrowful

19:07.147 --> 19:09.905
and I know
that would be the last thing

19:09.907 --> 19:11.131
you would want us to be.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.393
So, anyway, you made us happy
while you were here,

19:14.487 --> 19:16.545
and we're happy
that you're at peace.

19:16.564 --> 19:18.547
