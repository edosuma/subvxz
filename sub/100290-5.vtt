PREVIOUSLY...

00:07.760 --> 00:09.480
Open the profiles, <i>The Circle.</i>

00:09.560 --> 00:12.200
Let's meet this Brady Bunch.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.840
I don't know,
that photo looks like she's a catfish.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.920
"The person being blocked is..."

00:21.480 --> 00:22.560
"...Ana Carla."

00:23.760 --> 00:26.440
Wait! What?

00:29.080 --> 00:32.800
The person we decided to block is...

00:33.880 --> 00:34.800
"Julia"?

00:34.880 --> 00:35.720
BLOCKED
JULIA

00:42.320 --> 00:44.880
Luma born from Lucas and Marcel.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.320
Send the profile.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.560
"Luma joined the chat."

00:49.640 --> 00:52.240
She seems like a very strong player.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.200
Luma arrived like this...

00:54.280 --> 00:55.480
stepping up.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.120
Hi, beautiful girl from Acre.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.640
I can already tell you're incredible.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.120
Luma's first ally.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.240
"Alert!"

01:04.520 --> 01:05.880
Holy shit!

01:05.960 --> 01:07.840
You don't reveal yourself.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.240
What do we know about you, boy?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.040
Circle, message.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.440
I admit I have a little crush

01:15.520 --> 01:16.840
on Lucas.

01:16.920 --> 01:20.320
I need to go hard
on that sweet talk right now!

01:20.400 --> 01:23.040
I woke up thinking of you.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.320
Lucas...

01:26.400 --> 01:28.040
Akel, the smooth talker.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.080
In character.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.000
Are you missing me already?

01:32.080 --> 01:33.520
Heart emoji.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.040
Thank you for the kiss, baby.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.720
A ton of kisses.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.440
Circle, update my status.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.600
Are we all hydrated?

01:41.680 --> 01:43.160
I'm gonna see some likes.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.680
"Are we all hydrated?"

01:45.760 --> 01:48.680
That's a hard bunch to please. Oh, my God.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.200
"The player voted as two-faced is..."

01:52.680 --> 01:53.520
TWO-FACED

01:53.600 --> 01:55.000
Gosh!

01:55.080 --> 01:56.040
Me?

01:56.120 --> 01:59.440
For the love of God!

01:59.800 --> 02:00.640
POSSIBLE CATFISH

02:00.720 --> 02:02.200
Virgin Mary. For real?

02:02.280 --> 02:04.200
You're a catfish and two-faced!

02:04.920 --> 02:07.800
My name is Rayssa, I'm 22-years-old...

02:08.240 --> 02:09.280
Did you get that?

02:09.360 --> 02:10.760
The winner has arrived.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.480
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:23.640 --> 02:27.400
<i>Brace yourselves,</i>
<i>the slayer from Manaus has arrived.</i>

02:27.480 --> 02:29.240

02:29.320 --> 02:30.360
Did you get that?

02:30.440 --> 02:31.840
The winner has arrived.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.160
<i>What the guys will think about her?</i>

02:35.800 --> 02:38.880
"A new player joined <i>The Circle."</i>

02:40.480 --> 02:41.520
One more!

02:41.600 --> 02:44.240
Add and remove...

02:44.600 --> 02:45.520
It never ends?

02:46.320 --> 02:47.640
Oh, my!

02:47.720 --> 02:49.560
<i>Honey, that's how the game works!</i>

02:51.840 --> 02:53.840
ONE OF YOU WILL GO ON A DATE
BASED ON POLL

02:53.920 --> 02:54.760
What do you mean?

02:54.840 --> 02:57.600
<i>Ray will be granted access</i>
<i>to the </i>The Circle's <i>Opinion Poll</i>

02:57.680 --> 03:00.720
<i>and she'll choose one of them</i>
<i>to go on a date.</i>

03:01.960 --> 03:03.080
THE SEXIEST

03:03.160 --> 03:04.680
I don't know how it went

03:04.760 --> 03:07.280
for them to be rated as the sexiest.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.320
It must be
'cause they didn't see me yet.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.200
"Two-faced."

03:12.280 --> 03:16.400
I'll write down that you were voted
as the two-faced, okay, girl?

03:16.880 --> 03:18.040
BEST PLAYER

03:18.120 --> 03:20.360
Marina. Dumaresq.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.640
"Trustworthy."

03:25.760 --> 03:28.160
She won the two-faced title,

03:28.240 --> 03:30.840
and now she's the trustworthy
of the game?

03:30.920 --> 03:32.000
I'm not following.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.640
"Before you know who is going on the date,

03:38.720 --> 03:41.240
you can take a look
at the new player's profile."

03:41.320 --> 03:43.600
<i>The Circle </i>is always
full of surprises, right?

03:45.360 --> 03:46.400
"Ray"?

03:46.480 --> 03:48.640
Ray, what a lovely picture!

03:48.720 --> 03:50.640
I thought it was a boy!

03:50.720 --> 03:53.880
Oh, my! More women! Loved it!

03:53.960 --> 03:55.760
Wow, Ray it's beautiful!

03:56.040 --> 03:56.960
Let me see.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.640
Circle, open Ray's profile.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.360
Beautiful, authentic Brazilian woman.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.160
But so is Luma.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.960
Look at that, so pretty!

04:06.040 --> 04:08.440
-"Ray, 25-years-old."
-"Single."

04:08.520 --> 04:11.360

Black and Native Indian,

Atypical Manauara, dancer and available.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.320
-Nice to meet you. Hashtag..."
-"...RaySlays."

04:18.680 --> 04:19.680
Totally.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.160
We already know you're available
'cause you said you're single.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.600
Yikes.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.200
Why so desperate?

04:26.280 --> 04:29.080
I liked it. But it looks catfish-y.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.960
Ray seems like a person
who speaks her mind.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.120
That goes "bang!"

04:35.440 --> 04:37.720
That's it. I've decided.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.520
"The player chosen
to go on a date with Ray is..."

04:42.600 --> 04:44.760
I'm ready.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.160
If it's me, you know the game, right?

04:50.720 --> 04:53.400
I want an exclusive date with...

04:54.440 --> 04:55.760
Let's go, Circle.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.680
Okay, then. Was that it, Circle?

05:02.280 --> 05:04.520
Go on, enjoy your date.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.720
It's so beautiful!

05:17.640 --> 05:21.600
What is that? So much work into it!

05:25.320 --> 05:26.480
A date.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.000
That's something weird to have
with someone you don't know.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.400
I'm curious about
what you want to know.

05:34.880 --> 05:39.200
<i>Wake up, love.</i>
<i>Ray has arrived in strategy mode.</i>

06:01.480 --> 06:03.160

Circle, message.

06:06.520 --> 06:11.520

JP being the sexiest here?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000

have you flirted with anyone here?

06:15.080 --> 06:16.240
Send.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.600

06:46.200 --> 06:47.640
Yes!

06:47.720 --> 06:51.600

06:51.680 --> 06:53.480
She's on the hunt.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.160
<i>The girls are talking about JP.</i>
<i>I wonder if his ears are burning.</i>

06:57.240 --> 06:59.320
I'm here thinking...

06:59.400 --> 07:02.360
I might have a chat
with my princess from Acre.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.560
Circle, open a private chat with Luma.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.680
@JP INVITED YOU TO A PRIVATE CHAT

07:09.760 --> 07:12.680
-Jeez!
-Hi, love!

It's such a nice surprise!
I'm eating bruschetta…

07:32.440 --> 07:35.200
…and drinking tea,
pretending it's wine.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.480

Wait. Let's comment first.

07:54.360 --> 07:58.440
You're welcome here.
And bring some real wine.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.080
Bringing up the wine again?
What is she? A drunk?

She is!

08:18.680 --> 08:20.720
But we're gonna cut him off.

I'm gonna go hard on that one.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.000
I'm blushing so hard that I wanna hide.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.120
After that, blushing emoji again.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.480
Blushing all over? Again?

08:43.560 --> 08:44.520
Yes, again!

08:44.600 --> 08:46.000
-Don't send that.
-Send.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.200
You keep sending the blushing face.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.440
Please, Circle, remove the blushing face.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.240
You look like a 15-year-old.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.920
She's a grown woman.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.560
Now she's making conversation.
Circle, message.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.000
Right now,

09:22.080 --> 09:24.880
we need to be closer
to the ones we relate to

09:24.960 --> 09:28.040
and keep an eye
with the ones we don't really trust.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.040
Send.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.880
JP is real.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.120
I don't care.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.960
I'm telling you,
if Luma is someone else...

I really hope not.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.400

Awn, so cute!

09:58.880 --> 10:00.240
Wake up.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.120
Stop!

10:02.800 --> 10:05.040
We already have the couples formed.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.960
I would say I have a partner here.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.560
Bye, JP.

I really want your support...

10:38.760 --> 10:40.040
for us to get to the top.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.360
A new player has arrived.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.640
What's up with her?

10:53.040 --> 10:54.680
My true beauty,

10:54.760 --> 10:57.920
the one underneath
pounds of makeup.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.800
I'll spray air freshener here

11:01.960 --> 11:05.080
Dream about me, Luma.
I'll dream about you too.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.600
A lot of emotions...

11:11.360 --> 11:12.600
on my first day.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.040
Circle,

11:16.120 --> 11:18.120
open chat with Marina.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.040
Talk to me, Lora, tell me everything!

11:27.120 --> 11:30.560
Marina and I are really similar,

11:30.640 --> 11:32.640
so I think she's gonna like Ray too.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.680
Circle, open chat with Lorayne.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.360
I'll spell the beans to her.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.000
I'm waiting to hear all about it.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.080
Circle, message.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.000
Girl, with lots of "I".

11:48.080 --> 11:51.440
The date was fancy, cheers emoji.

11:51.520 --> 11:55.800
Ray is totally awesome,
she's a little lost, of course,

11:55.880 --> 11:58.800
but I briefly explained to her
everything that has happened.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.680
#She'sOneOfUs. Send.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.400
You didn't say much.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.960
You didn't. Just skimmed through.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.680
Circle, message.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.800
Sis!

12:09.880 --> 12:11.520
Tell me everything.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.280
I want details.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.000
I found her a little desperate...

12:16.080 --> 12:19.280
"...after I read 'available'
on her profile."

12:19.360 --> 12:20.920
Circle, message.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.360
I was under the same impression
before I talked to her.

12:24.760 --> 12:28.400
But, sis, she seemed very honest
in everything she said.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.600
She liked JP.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.120
#TheFiremanIsNoJoke.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.000
I'm going to bed now.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.240
Good night for us both.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.480
Send.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.640
I'm sensing some trouble.
What about Luma?

12:44.720 --> 12:47.160
<i>It's a lot of fire</i>
<i>for just one fireman to handle.</i>

12:58.360 --> 12:59.600
Good morning, Circle.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.600
Good morning, gorgeous Lolo.
Did you sleep well?

13:04.680 --> 13:06.800
You had a date yesterday,
huh, you sassy?

13:07.160 --> 13:09.800
Let's chat
with the princess from Amazonas.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.480
I just want to confirm if...

13:14.240 --> 13:16.080
she's nice as they say.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.880
You're gonna break everyone's heart today.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.240
I'm gonna hit on all the boys here.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.840
Luma won't stand by and watch

13:23.920 --> 13:27.280
Ray hitting on JP
without saying anything.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.640
She chases boys now?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.840
So Luma will let her do what she wants?

13:32.400 --> 13:35.560
Ray arrived straight from Manaus...

13:35.640 --> 13:38.360
But she seems to have brought
a lot of strategies.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.120
No one is naive.
Everyone here has a purpose.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.520
Everyone is smart here.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.240
I really want the chance to meet one boy.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.240
I'm needy.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.000
<i>Is Gaybol in the yoga room?</i>

13:55.080 --> 13:57.280
<i>Is he lost or something?</i>

14:01.720 --> 14:04.280
I'm thinking that I didn't talk much
with Akel,

14:04.360 --> 14:06.240
we interact very little.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.920
Circle, open a chat with Akel.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.520
@GAYBOL INVITED YOU TO A CHAT

14:12.640 --> 14:14.400
What is this?

14:14.480 --> 14:16.720
"Gaybol invited you to a private chat."

14:16.800 --> 14:19.400
I wasn't expecting that at all.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.040
I want to know why he doesn't like
to talk to me.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.160
Circle, go to private chat with Gaybol.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.520
PRIVATE CHAT
AKEL - GAYBOL

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
Circle, message.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.520
What's up, Akel? We don't talk much, bro.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.640
Let's just break that ice.

14:34.720 --> 14:39.000
It's hard for me to open up
and show people the real me:

14:39.080 --> 14:41.400
I'm someone cheerful, funny,

14:41.480 --> 14:44.240
and I like to hang out at bars
with friends.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.120
Circle, send message.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.080
So he chose the wrong profile description.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.400
He said he liked to stay home.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.520
Circle, message.

14:54.600 --> 14:58.320
What? But on your profile description
you said you liked to stay home.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.480
You have a girlfriend, so I saw you
like the Netflix-and-chill type.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.120
Circle, send.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.600
If Gaybol approached me 'cause he thinks
I'm gonna be the Influencer,

15:10.680 --> 15:13.640
he'll start to think
that I would keep him here.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.680
But I won't fall for it. I'm too smart.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.800
If he wants to play, let's do it.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.240
Circle, message.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.160
And you seem like the guy
that is always going out,

15:23.240 --> 15:26.800
but your Carnival picture
was from St. John's day in June.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.720
Circle, send message.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.720
Let's see how he's gonna handle that.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.960
He wants to get back at me,
but I can do the same

15:35.320 --> 15:38.360
so quietly and fatally,
that he will be leaving us.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.280
Actually, I think he's lost.
He's not a strong player.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.080
Quite the opposite. Akel's...

15:43.440 --> 15:44.880
gonna be out of here real soon.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.440
I'll get back at him.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.880
I'll put him exactly where he belongs,

15:48.960 --> 15:50.520
last on my ratings.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.560
Circle, message.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.960
What do you think about the next ratings?

15:55.040 --> 15:56.360
Circle, send.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.840
What do I think it's gonna happen
with the ratings?

16:03.440 --> 16:04.320
Mister Akel...

16:04.400 --> 16:05.440
Circle, message.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.600
I never know what to make of it.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.200
But I'm being positive this time.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.160
I'll try to reach his heart now.

16:12.240 --> 16:16.280
#Playmakers #WeAreTogether.

16:17.080 --> 16:20.240
He just said Playmakers
to remind me of the group chat.

16:20.320 --> 16:23.200
I want to make sure he gives me
good ratings.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.240
Circle, message.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.360
I think the team is growing closer,

16:27.440 --> 16:30.400
and a #PlaymakerInfluencer

16:30.760 --> 16:32.440
would be so good for the group.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.360
Sending good vibes, bro.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.960
I don't think he's gonna be happy
if I'm the Playmaker Influencer.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.800
Circle, close chat.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.840
Akel was very strategical, man.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.080
He acted like me, played nice,

16:51.160 --> 16:53.280
but you could sense

16:53.360 --> 16:55.400
that he actually wasn't being nice at all.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.840
If he wants to pretend to be friends,
let's do it.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.000
I'm so onto you, Akel.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.240
Pray I don't get to be
the Influencer, Gaybol.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.280
You better pray.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.440
I'll start to talk shit about Akel.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.400
<i>It seems the Playmakers are having trouble</i>

17:11.480 --> 17:13.320
<i>and they might be relegated.</i>

17:13.680 --> 17:15.440
<i>What about the girls from She Fights?</i>

17:15.520 --> 17:18.000
<i>Are they closer than ever?</i>

17:23.360 --> 17:27.800
I want to open the She Fights group chat.

17:28.280 --> 17:35.040
I want to ask the girls
if they think we should add Ray.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.400
Circle,

17:36.480 --> 17:41.040
open She Fights chat!

17:43.800 --> 17:46.880
"Dumaresq invited you
to She Fights group chat."

17:47.280 --> 17:48.400
Did he add Ray?

17:48.480 --> 17:53.160
Circle, open Dumaresq's chat, She Fights.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.080
Without Ray.

17:58.840 --> 17:59.720
What?

17:59.800 --> 18:01.720
Circle, please, write down.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.920
Good morning, girls.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.040
We have a possible new addition
to the group.

18:10.120 --> 18:14.480
But first, I want Lorayne to tell me

18:14.560 --> 18:19.160
what she thinks about Ray?

18:19.240 --> 18:21.200
Send, Circle.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.360
I think it's fair.
She should be added for sure.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.920
She'll be added.
You guys are going to love her.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.480
Circle, message.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.880
I love a good gossip! LOL.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.040
I'm dying to talk to her.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.440
One more for the team?

18:36.800 --> 18:37.640
Send.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.120
Marina is a blabbermouth, like me.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.920
Not a blabbermouth, Mari. Communicator.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.400
So let's do this. Circle, message.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.120
Good morning, friends.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.600
We had gin tonic at our date last night.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.240
Gin tonic!

18:55.480 --> 18:58.360
"I loved her! She seemed genuine,
but a little lost, of course.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.120
LOL. She's one of us."

19:00.600 --> 19:02.640
Luma is gonna say: "Add her already!

19:02.720 --> 19:04.960
-I thought she would be here."
-"Yummy!"

19:05.320 --> 19:06.680
Circle, message.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.520
Add the gurl here. Gurl, with "U".

19:10.000 --> 19:10.840
Send.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.600
So, Circle.

19:13.680 --> 19:17.840
Add Ray to She Fights group.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.160
@DUMARESQ INVITED YOU
TO THE GROUP CHAT

19:21.240 --> 19:23.320
Look at that! Out of nowhere,

19:23.400 --> 19:25.960
"Dumaresq invited you to the chat."

19:26.840 --> 19:28.840
Oh, my God!

19:28.920 --> 19:31.480

Ray joined! You go, girl!

19:42.480 --> 19:44.160
Circle,

19:44.440 --> 19:45.600
write it down:

19:45.960 --> 19:48.440
Girl, tell us everything!

19:48.520 --> 19:51.080
What were your first impressions

19:51.160 --> 19:54.880
about the guys? Send!

19:56.360 --> 19:57.480
Jeez!

19:57.560 --> 20:00.680
Dumaresq it's totally against men,
but he only talks about them.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.200
I don't understand him.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.040
Let's ask,
"Is this group to talk about men?"

20:06.400 --> 20:08.760
I want to know about the new girl.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.400
Circle, message.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.200
Hey, Ray!

20:12.280 --> 20:14.680
"Before talking about guys,
talk about yourself.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.160
#Priorities."

20:17.240 --> 20:19.280
Ouch!

20:19.640 --> 20:22.000
Dumaresq must be upset.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.800
Jesus, Luma! You destroyed me

20:28.880 --> 20:32.880
with kindness and grace.

20:32.960 --> 20:37.560
True. You're totally right! Jeez!

20:37.640 --> 20:38.680
Circle, message.

20:38.760 --> 20:39.960
Gurl!

20:40.040 --> 20:42.840
You're a dancer, right?

20:42.920 --> 20:44.520
Tell us about that,

20:44.600 --> 20:48.360
and we can talk about crushes later.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.440
Send.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.160
Right, I'm gonna talk about me.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.360
I have a lot to tell,
you need to know the real me.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.000
Circle, message.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.680
Girls,

20:58.960 --> 21:03.360
I'm a dance student,
and I slay in all styles.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.960
My style is more Brazilian typical dances,

21:07.040 --> 21:09.320
and I twerk like it's
nobody's business. Send.

21:10.320 --> 21:14.640
Twerking it's not a style.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.640
Marina needs to see this.
I'm the queen of the dance floor.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.520
Circle, message.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.800
So, guys,
it was lovely to meet all of you.

Kiss and heart emojis.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.000
Send.

21:30.480 --> 21:33.320
I was able to know Ray better
on this chat.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.280
She seems cooler than I thought.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.160
And I couldn't help but notice

21:39.240 --> 21:42.600
that Dumaresq is contradicting himself
talking about men.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.760
Yes, forget men.

21:46.840 --> 21:50.360
Let's talk about life,
'cause each and every one of us

21:50.440 --> 21:52.160
needs to talk about ourselves.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.200
My energy is a little down.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.800
'Cause I was too hasty.

21:58.640 --> 22:02.920
You can see it as, "Wow!
Dumaresq is totally focused on the game."

22:09.040 --> 22:12.000
<i>While Ray sprays some perfume</i>
<i>that no one is gonna smell,</i>

22:12.080 --> 22:16.320

Circle, open chat with JP.

Hi!

22:22.720 --> 22:23.680
Great!

22:23.760 --> 22:24.880
Oh, my!

22:25.520 --> 22:26.720
The new girl.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.560
I need to attack.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.120
If I don't do anything now,

22:31.200 --> 22:33.200
I'll be left behind by the other girls.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.120

Hi, JP. Good morning! How are you doing?

I thought you would invite me
to the date.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.560
Sad face. Send.

22:50.040 --> 22:53.240
That wouldn't be a good idea 'cause...

22:53.320 --> 22:55.240
we wouldn't focus much, would we?

Laughs. It's a shame
I wasn't able to take you.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.280
I think you're very handsome!
My body is in flames.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.960
#CallTheFireman.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.160
That's right!

23:15.240 --> 23:17.480
And JP scores!

23:17.560 --> 23:19.880
So sassy! I'm dangerous!

23:19.960 --> 23:22.480
We already got a princess from Acre
on the team.

23:22.560 --> 23:26.000
Now I will bring one from Manaus.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.280
Circle, message.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.360
A body like that in flames?

23:29.440 --> 23:31.760
The fireman is here to help.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.280
Circle, message.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.320
So bring the hose and extinguish it.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.120
#I'mOnFire. Send.

23:41.880 --> 23:42.880
Oh, no.

23:42.960 --> 23:47.080
I need to get my head wet,
'cause it's hot in here.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.640
"#I'mOnFire."

23:48.720 --> 23:50.000
Oh, my.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.680
He must be losing his shit.

23:52.760 --> 23:53.920
What a beautiful girl.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.840
I'm gonna give her a kiss. Where is it?

23:59.640 --> 24:01.560
Such a pretty lady.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.440
Is he thinking I'm too easy?

24:04.360 --> 24:05.640
I don't even care.

24:06.160 --> 24:10.160
I hope from the bottom of my heart
that Ray isn't a catfish.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.480
<i>Jeez! JP is looking more like a sniper</i>
<i>than a fireman.</i>

24:13.560 --> 24:15.760
My plan is totally active.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.240
I'm in action.

24:17.320 --> 24:21.080
Everything is working according to plan.

24:21.920 --> 24:27.400
<i>There's a love triangle taking place.</i>
<i>#RayLuP spicing things up on </i>The Circle.

24:27.480 --> 24:30.600
<i>Now let's change the subject</i>
<i>and end this boredom?</i>

24:30.680 --> 24:31.840
<i>Right, Dumaresq?</i>

24:33.440 --> 24:35.000
"Truth or Dare."

24:35.480 --> 24:36.320
I'm screwed.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.920
A lot of noise and fuss.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.360
"Which one requires more courage?

24:41.440 --> 24:45.400
Answering a question
or asking for a dare?"

24:45.480 --> 24:49.160
"Do you have the guts to ask
the questions that need to be asked?"

24:49.240 --> 24:50.840
Do you want some sass, girl?

24:51.240 --> 24:53.360
"Can you answer what is asked?"

24:53.440 --> 24:57.040
"Or is daring enough to face
<i>The Circle's </i>dares?"

24:57.360 --> 24:58.600
"Are you ready?"

24:58.680 --> 25:00.560
Yes!

25:01.520 --> 25:03.280
Oh, my! It started with me!

25:03.360 --> 25:04.560
Jesus. So help me God.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.400
Circle, message.

25:06.760 --> 25:10.600
Akel, can I be the wedding planner
for your wedding with Lorayne?

25:12.400 --> 25:14.880
Great question, Big Lucas.

25:14.960 --> 25:19.120
"Can I be the wedding planner
for your wedding with Lorayne?"

25:20.280 --> 25:22.160
Yikes.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.640
Circle, message.

25:23.720 --> 25:26.160
Big Lucas, that's an easy one.

25:26.520 --> 25:29.160
I'll choose dare to start this game.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.360
Circle, send.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.120
DARE

25:33.200 --> 25:36.760
"Dare, write your name in the air

25:36.840 --> 25:39.080
with your ass"?

25:39.160 --> 25:41.600
Jeez! That's not easy at all!

25:41.680 --> 25:43.160
How do you do that?

25:43.240 --> 25:46.360
This is not pretty.
What am I doing with my life?

25:47.520 --> 25:50.120
The "A" goes up,

25:50.200 --> 25:53.040
then sideways.
I'm feeling my inner thigh.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.760
Going down, up,

25:54.840 --> 25:56.240
middle, then up again,

25:56.760 --> 25:58.840
go down, then a little more.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.720
Now the "E".

26:00.800 --> 26:03.400
Look how I go down.
I'm doing a squat. Look at the "L".

26:04.680 --> 26:06.600
At least his name is short.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.600
I injured all my knee ligaments.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.280
Look at that!

26:11.360 --> 26:13.720
I'm gonna ask JP. Great.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.120
Let's do this, nerd. Ask away.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.800
Who is the person
you relate the least in <i>The Circle?</i>

26:20.880 --> 26:22.880
#TruthTime.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.760
Circle, send message.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.240
Good one, boy.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.800
He went straight there.

26:28.840 --> 26:33.440
Finally Gaybol joined <i>The Circle.</i>

26:34.040 --> 26:35.760
Truth. Send.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.040
"Truth."

26:37.120 --> 26:38.840
Gosh!

26:39.080 --> 26:40.280
Circle, message.

26:40.360 --> 26:44.760
Nothing personal,
but it's you, Gaybol. In your face!

26:46.480 --> 26:49.400
Jesus! That went like a bomb.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.520
Like a bomb!

26:52.560 --> 26:54.400
Okay. That's what I needed to hear.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.960
Okay, JP, it's all good.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.880
I can try to get close to him,

26:57.960 --> 27:00.680
it's good information to stay on the game.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.480
-Let's see what she does now.
-Gosh.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.560
Circle, message.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.360
What attracts you the most about me?

27:12.640 --> 27:13.760
Send.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.080
How is that relevant?

27:17.440 --> 27:18.840
Truth. Send.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.320
It's obvious, dude. Just say it.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.360
Circle, message.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.920
Putting aside the fact that you are hot...

27:28.000 --> 27:31.440
"...your energy affected me
in a way that I can't even explain."

27:37.840 --> 27:39.560
Now things are heating up.

27:39.640 --> 27:40.880
Circle, message.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.880
Two players are stranded in an island,

27:42.960 --> 27:45.720
who do you save and who do you abandon?

27:46.080 --> 27:46.960
Send.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.880
Gosh! That question was graceful,
Luminha.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.600
Circle, write it down.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.800
I certainly would save you,

27:55.880 --> 28:01.360
and would abandon JP,
'cause he knows what to do

28:01.440 --> 28:04.720
in dangerous situations.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.480
#CallTheFireman.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.400
Send.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.880
He-- Jeez.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.400
I don't even know
how to conjugate the verb here.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.600
"He fenced it."

28:15.680 --> 28:17.720
He seated on the fence so hard.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.440
Dumaresq is dangerous.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.800
He's a smart player.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.400
Circle, message.

28:24.480 --> 28:25.560
Ray,

28:25.640 --> 28:28.040
who do you think is gonna have
the lower ratings?

28:28.120 --> 28:29.600
Three question marks.

28:29.680 --> 28:30.920
Circle, send.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.000
Look at that.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.560
Akel, that's not the type of question
you ask someone.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.440
Circle, dare.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.200
DARE

28:42.280 --> 28:46.840
"Write and recite a poem
to another player."

28:46.920 --> 28:48.600
I hit on him,

28:48.680 --> 28:51.640
and now I'm writing him a poem?
Wait a minute.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.920
Roses are red

28:55.200 --> 28:56.560
Violets are blue

28:56.920 --> 28:58.920
JP, put down my fire

28:59.480 --> 29:01.400
And I'll give myself to you.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.320
" I'll give myself to you."

29:08.400 --> 29:10.240
That was live, bro!

29:10.320 --> 29:11.840
I saw the line,

29:12.320 --> 29:14.480
then I went there and stepped on it.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.520
How defiant!

29:16.920 --> 29:18.240
What a shitty rhyme.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.720
Circle, message.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.480
JP, full of life...

29:21.560 --> 29:23.240
"...Stay quiet, listen to your wife,

29:23.320 --> 29:25.720
or I might use the trench knife."

29:25.800 --> 29:27.160
-A trench knife?
-What is that?

29:27.240 --> 29:29.880
-It's a type of machete.
-A big knife.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.600
She showed her cards.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.600
What do I say and not upset Luma?

29:36.560 --> 29:37.760
Circle, message.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.640
Don't tease me, I might go.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.600
"There's fireman for everyone.
And love too."

29:43.680 --> 29:46.280
Let me grab that knife right now.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.480
Is that the type of guy you want?

29:52.880 --> 29:55.880
You can corner me all you want,

29:55.960 --> 29:57.800
I'm an open book. Bring it on, Duma.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.120
Circle, write down.

30:00.200 --> 30:05.600
Imagine that today's <i>The Circle's </i>final,

30:05.680 --> 30:12.000
you, me and another player are on the run.

30:12.080 --> 30:16.800
Why should you win? Interrogation mark.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.360
Wow! That's harder
than a STA question, bro!

30:19.440 --> 30:22.520
He's expecting a champion speech,
it seems.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.800
Ask for a dare.
Run away from that question.

30:25.880 --> 30:28.400
Circle, truth. Send.

30:29.920 --> 30:33.080
Jeez. He should've chosen the dare.
Poor thing.

30:33.920 --> 30:34.920
What a shame.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.200
I think I should win <i>The Circle</i>

30:37.280 --> 30:39.400
'cause I finished several games in life,

30:39.480 --> 30:42.040
and now I would win a real-life game.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.000
#ProfessionalGamer.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.040
That's ridiculous.

30:46.840 --> 30:50.520
What's that got to do with real life, bro?
Shit gets real in here.

30:50.600 --> 30:54.280
The real-life game couldn't be
farther from this, okay, honey?

30:54.360 --> 30:57.920
Unfortunately,
you won't win the real-life game.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.000
Is it over yet?

31:05.720 --> 31:10.080
Time to relax after that tense situation.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.360
<i>The Circle</i> never stops.

31:13.880 --> 31:18.240
<i>It never stops, indeed.</i>
<i>This isn't a spiritual retreat, girl.</i>

31:19.200 --> 31:20.320
"Alert!"

31:20.920 --> 31:22.360
Oh, my! What is this about?

31:22.560 --> 31:27.840
But I'm in the bathtub!
I can't rest for one second, Circle!

31:28.120 --> 31:31.320
I hope it's not the ratings.
I'm not ready for that.

31:31.400 --> 31:32.240
ALERT!

31:32.440 --> 31:34.280
"It's time for the ratings."

31:34.360 --> 31:35.560
Jeez.

31:35.640 --> 31:36.760
You just said it, Akel.

31:37.680 --> 31:41.720
"Rate the players
from the one you like the most..."

31:41.800 --> 31:43.600
"...to the one you like the least."

31:43.680 --> 31:45.040
That's where I'm gonna play.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.360
I need to open some space, so I can go up.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.040
I need to be a real player.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.080
"As a new player,

31:53.160 --> 31:56.720
Ray can rate, but cannot be rated."

31:57.200 --> 31:59.000
Been there, done that.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.920
Oh, my God!

32:02.000 --> 32:03.120
Great.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.840
Enjoy it, girl.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.560
'Cause that won't happen next time.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.640
Great! Let's do this!

32:09.720 --> 32:10.680
Great.

32:10.760 --> 32:14.400
Everything goes down to this.

32:14.680 --> 32:17.120
Circle, open ratings.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.200
Heads will roll.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.640
I'll only be an Influencer

32:23.720 --> 32:28.440
if Marina and Dumaresq get bad ratings.

32:28.800 --> 32:32.640
Circle, rate Marina. Seventh place.

32:33.520 --> 32:36.280
Marina deserves first place again,

32:36.360 --> 32:39.040
'cause she's a great player

32:39.120 --> 32:40.280
and honest.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.680
She does exactly the same things
I do, you know?

32:44.080 --> 32:46.560
Circle, first place,

32:46.640 --> 32:47.680
Lorayne.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.040
She's my sis, that won't change.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.240
Fourth place, Lorayne.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.000
She's very sneaky

32:54.080 --> 32:56.200
in this game, you know?

32:56.280 --> 32:58.080
Fourth place is great.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.640
Circle, fifth place

32:59.720 --> 33:01.560
is Lorayne.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.640
In the end,

33:03.720 --> 33:06.480
the best player
is the one manipulating everyone.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.840
Meaning, Lorayne and Marina.

33:07.920 --> 33:11.800
And we need a chance
to block one of them.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.880
I might be able to contribute
for Gaybol's bad ratings.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.520
Circle, rate Gaybol on fifth place.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.120
Gaybol, you would be in seventh just fine.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.760
You're in fifth
just because I want to be the Influencer.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.400
That's my strategy.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.880
Seventh place

33:25.960 --> 33:27.400
it's Luma.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.080
I don't like her.

33:29.680 --> 33:33.280
Circle, first place, Luma.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.040
She arrived with really good vibes.

33:36.320 --> 33:39.360
We talked and got closer.

33:39.720 --> 33:42.920
Let's decide about JP?

33:43.200 --> 33:45.400
-For first?
-We like him the most.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.360
Sixth place is JP,

33:49.440 --> 33:52.040
someone I don't talk much to.

33:52.120 --> 33:55.000
Second place, JP.

33:55.760 --> 33:56.920
On my last ratings,

33:57.000 --> 34:01.120
I rated Marina and Lora in good positions.

34:01.200 --> 34:06.040
If I vote for him,
I have a chance to be Influencer.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.600
Circle, third place, Dumaresq.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.960
He might be a good ally.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.240
-Right?
-Yes.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.360
Fifth place, Duma.

34:18.080 --> 34:21.960
I don't know
if he would protect me or not.

34:22.040 --> 34:25.360
Circle, second place, Lucas.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.160
I'm doing the opposite,

34:29.240 --> 34:31.360
rating poorly the ones up there

34:31.440 --> 34:33.920
and giving good ratings
to the ones down there.

34:34.360 --> 34:37.960
I'm ready to be Influencer.
I think my time has arrived.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.760
Second place goes to Akel.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.840
Akel is a great player at the moment,

34:43.920 --> 34:46.040
talking and having fun with everyone.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.600
Circle, send my ratings.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.200
RATINGS COMPLETE

34:50.720 --> 34:52.560
My God. What now?

34:53.040 --> 34:56.400
Now I'm so anxious
that I might eat my hand.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.920
My opinions changed today.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.520
So theirs might have too.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.240
Positive thinking, I'll be Influencer.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.760
Luma is scared.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.600
#YouBetterBelieveIt.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.120
<i>Ratings complete.</i>

35:12.880 --> 35:15.840
<i>What are the players doing</i>
<i>while they wait for the results?</i>

35:16.840 --> 35:19.520
<i>Wow! JP it's not at the gym?</i>

35:20.200 --> 35:22.800
Circle, open chat with JP.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.920
@LUMA INVITED YOU TO A PRIVATE CHAT

35:25.000 --> 35:27.960
Wait. "Luma invited you
to a private chat."

35:28.040 --> 35:31.040
Luma wants to chat with JP

35:31.120 --> 35:33.560
to discuss today's game.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.360
And his comment about Ray.
Let's see what's up with that.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.280
Great.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.960
I wanted to talk to her.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.560
Circle, open private chat with Luma.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.960
"Hey, there", right?

35:47.400 --> 35:49.200
Yes. "Hey, there.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.920
-Is someone there?" Right?
-Would she say that?

35:52.360 --> 35:54.160
Circle, message.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.320
Hey, there. Wanna chat?

35:56.400 --> 35:57.240
Right?

35:57.760 --> 35:59.280
How are things over there?

35:59.360 --> 36:00.640
Question mark.

36:00.720 --> 36:01.760
Send.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.600
Circle, message.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.680
I wanna chat, baby.

36:06.840 --> 36:07.800
LOL.

36:07.880 --> 36:09.840
You might have noticed

36:09.920 --> 36:11.720
that they are forming alliances

36:11.800 --> 36:14.520
and couples to get stronger in the game.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.520
I think we should protect ourselves too.

36:17.600 --> 36:20.760
What do you think? Question mark, send.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.920
-Jeez.
-Oh, my.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.600
Things are really tense today.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.640
Circle, message.

36:27.720 --> 36:30.560
I agree 100%. We're already allies.

36:30.640 --> 36:31.960
People are playing dirty.

36:32.040 --> 36:35.360
Don't you agree? Question mark. Send.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.120
Totally agree.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.760
Circle, message.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.400
I agree.

36:40.920 --> 36:44.880
I had a chat with Ray
and she seems really nice.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.840
What do you think about bring her closer?

36:46.920 --> 36:48.800
#TeamNorth-Northeast.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.800
Send.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.840
"What do you think about bring her closer?
#TeamNorth-Northeast."

36:53.920 --> 36:56.040
I don't know. He hit on her today.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.000
Some jokes-- He didn't hit on her.

36:58.080 --> 37:02.400
If his strategy now
is to have three of us together,

37:02.480 --> 37:06.040
Gaybol and Lucas are going down.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.840
Circle, message.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.200
Perfect.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.880
#TeamNorth-Northeast.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.840
Send.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.320
But there's Dumaresq
from Northeast too, right?

37:17.680 --> 37:19.960
Right. Circle, message.

37:20.040 --> 37:23.120
Some people are playing nice,
trying to please everyone

37:23.200 --> 37:25.800
and doing the couples thing.
Let's keep our eyes peeled.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.080
Send.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.640
Marina has his partnership with Lorayne.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.800
Lorayne has his partnership with Akel.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.520
And Lucas has it with Marina.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.600
Circle, message.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.200
My eyes are peeled all right,
exclamation point.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.880
#ICan'tHandleIt.

37:42.960 --> 37:43.840
Send.

37:44.800 --> 37:45.760
"#ICan'tHandleIt."

37:47.440 --> 37:49.000
Exactly.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.920
Circle, message.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.760
We'll hold hands until the very end.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.640
Kisses, my baby.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.080
Kissing heart emoji.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.120
"Kisses, my baby."

38:00.400 --> 38:01.640
Circle, message.

38:01.720 --> 38:02.840
Wonderful.

38:02.920 --> 38:06.480
Let's pay more attention
and get even closer.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.440
#Kisses.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.360
Send.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.560
PRIVATE CHAT
LUMA - JP

38:12.000 --> 38:13.720
Next step is to bring Ray to our side.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.040
Even better: Ray and Dumaresq,
but he can bring everything down.

38:17.120 --> 38:20.400
JP only thinks about strategy now

38:20.480 --> 38:21.720
'cause he was alone.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.000
He was with the boys, but they are weak.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.160
Lucas and Gaybol.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.200
So now he wants to unite with the girls.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.720
If that's his thing,
he's playing for real.

38:31.120 --> 38:33.600
And like he invited Luma,

38:33.680 --> 38:36.080
he might be inviting other people too.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.480
But I don't think he's a son a bitch.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.200
We'll see. Let's hold our horses a bit.

38:42.760 --> 38:46.640
<i>Sure! 'Cause you're exactly</i>
<i>who you claim to be, right, Luma?</i>

38:53.080 --> 38:54.240
"Alert!"

38:54.320 --> 38:57.080
Oh, my! Is it time?

38:57.160 --> 38:59.960
Now I'm gonna sweat through my armpits.

39:00.040 --> 39:00.880
ALERT!

39:01.440 --> 39:04.720
"The rating results are in."

39:05.360 --> 39:07.480
There's no going back. They counted.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.160
It's now or never.

39:09.440 --> 39:13.480
Now we'll find out
what is on people's mind.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.240
"The result is going to be revealed
from first to eighth place"?

39:18.320 --> 39:20.880
It will be backwards today? Why?

39:20.960 --> 39:25.080
Maybe it's like saying goes,
"The last shall be the first"?

39:25.440 --> 39:28.240
Circle, don't play games with my heart.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.520
THE FATE WILL BE DECIDED
FOR ONE OF THE PLAYERS

39:30.600 --> 39:32.720
"The ratings..."

39:32.800 --> 39:35.720
"...will decide the fate
of one of the players."

39:35.800 --> 39:36.720
Ouch.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.280
Dear Lord!

39:40.360 --> 39:41.840
What do you mean?

39:43.960 --> 39:45.480
"The less popular

39:45.560 --> 39:48.360
-will be blocked..."
-"...immediately..."

39:48.440 --> 39:49.640
"...from <i>The Circle."</i>

39:50.040 --> 39:51.840
-Bro...
-What?

39:54.480 --> 39:55.920
Oh, no. It can't be.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.840
They can't do changes like that.
What is this?

39:58.920 --> 40:00.240
ROCKET SOUND!

40:00.320 --> 40:01.680
The game is like this...

40:02.920 --> 40:07.440
Brother, I can't be last!

40:07.520 --> 40:11.760
My strategy isn't, "it might work",

40:11.840 --> 40:13.360
it is "it has to work".

40:14.480 --> 40:15.360
Bro.

40:19.160 --> 40:20.800
1ST

40:20.880 --> 40:22.120
It won't be Lorayne.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.840
First place is Lorayne again,
I'm sure of it.

40:24.920 --> 40:26.280
It's Duma or Marina.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.440
It can be Marina,

40:28.840 --> 40:30.800
or Akel,

40:30.880 --> 40:32.880
or Dumaresq.

40:33.120 --> 40:36.200
For the love of God.
I never wanted something this much.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.800
First place,

40:37.880 --> 40:43.320
the most popular on <i>The Circle,</i>
based on the ratings today is...

40:44.880 --> 40:45.840
Let's go!

40:45.920 --> 40:46.920
Show it to me!

40:48.840 --> 40:50.160
JP?

40:50.240 --> 40:52.720
Ops! Oh, my!

40:53.160 --> 40:55.280
Jeez!

40:57.520 --> 40:59.440
Thank you, God!

40:59.520 --> 41:01.760
<i>Nobody saw that coming.</i>

41:01.840 --> 41:03.960
I'm shocked!

41:06.040 --> 41:08.960
Jeez!

41:09.240 --> 41:12.520
He's Luma's ally!

41:12.800 --> 41:15.040
So what?

41:19.160 --> 41:21.240
No. There's something fishy going on.

41:21.960 --> 41:26.240
I'm in shock!

41:26.560 --> 41:28.760
A lot is gonna change now.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.720
Maybe everyone changed strategies?

41:32.800 --> 41:35.480
Maybe Ray voted for him

41:35.840 --> 41:37.840
and so did Luma.

41:37.920 --> 41:38.880
It's over there.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.040
JP, you're a winner.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.680
Second place,

41:42.760 --> 41:46.400
let's go Dumaresq,
show what you came here for.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.520
Bring it to me.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.040
Come on!

41:50.120 --> 41:51.640
Who?

41:56.120 --> 41:58.840
Oh, my God!

41:58.920 --> 42:01.480
Oh, no, Circle, not again!

42:03.920 --> 42:08.240
I rated Lora really bad.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.680
Why is she in second place?

42:10.760 --> 42:12.760
Lorayne never starts anything.

42:12.840 --> 42:15.560
She's always lurking around.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.280
Now I'm worried about me.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.600
Third place.

42:21.680 --> 42:23.800
"Those who humble themselves
will be exalted."

42:23.880 --> 42:24.920
This is my moment.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.520
I'm grateful. I wanted to be Influencer,
but I'm happy with third place.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.360
I think it's nice.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.440
-It's Luma!
-Oh, my God!

42:41.480 --> 42:46.000
Luma? Are you kidding me?

42:47.040 --> 42:49.560
Making the team stronger.
We are good people.

42:49.640 --> 42:50.800
That's right, my partner.

42:50.880 --> 42:52.280
I'm in shock.

42:52.360 --> 42:56.320
The game is changing,
Marina is gonna feel it.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.000
JP and Luma are there.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.800
Fourth place

42:59.880 --> 43:02.520
on <i>The Circle's </i>ratings.
It will be me?

43:02.600 --> 43:06.200
I want to get this over with.
I can't take it anymore. I'm going nuts.

43:06.280 --> 43:10.160
I'm not gonna guess who it is.
I have no idea who it might be.

43:14.800 --> 43:15.800
Yes!

43:18.640 --> 43:19.600
Good one.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.600
Better than nothing.

43:21.680 --> 43:24.200
Luma's strategy regarding Marina

43:24.680 --> 43:26.640
is to get her even lower.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.800
Let's go to the fifth place.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.040
Dear Lord.

43:35.120 --> 43:38.480
I'm just praying not to be rated last.

43:38.560 --> 43:40.000
Me, Lucas or Dumaresq.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.560
Oh, my God! Phew!

43:48.640 --> 43:51.600
Thank you, Universe.

43:51.680 --> 43:52.840
Take a hike.

43:52.920 --> 43:54.880
Dumaresq and JP

43:54.960 --> 43:58.200
though that I would have been
the Influencer and ranked me poorly.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.840
That's the only explanation.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.400
Now it's sixth place.

44:02.760 --> 44:06.480
Me, Lucas and Gaybol. The last places.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.120
I don't think it's gonna be Lucas.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.400
I hope it's Lucas.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.960
It can't be Gaybol.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.000
I'm gonna pass out.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.600
Phew, Virgin Mary.

44:17.680 --> 44:20.920
Virgin Mary, Mother of Grace. I just died.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.600
Akel. I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

44:25.800 --> 44:28.520
<i>They need some sugar water to calm down.</i>

44:28.600 --> 44:33.080
Again, Gaybol and I in the same...

44:34.000 --> 44:36.720
Oh, my, they come up together.

44:37.640 --> 44:40.200
Seventh and eighth place,
but the last one will leave.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.160
The last one will be blocked. Who is it?

44:42.520 --> 44:44.800
My head is going to explode.

44:44.880 --> 44:48.240
Gaybol was last in the previous ratings,

44:48.320 --> 44:50.600
so he's probably really scared.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.920
I don't like Lucas at all.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.400
Did you see what Gaybol did at the game?

44:55.480 --> 44:58.560
He talked to everyone. What did Lucas do?

44:58.640 --> 45:02.960
He defended himself
when Luma said he was mysterious.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.560
If Gaybol stays, I will adopt him.

45:05.640 --> 45:09.000
Circle, let's go, baby.
Show it on screen, please.

45:09.080 --> 45:12.200
I'm so anxious, dude. Oh, my.

45:14.040 --> 45:14.880
I knew it.

45:21.600 --> 45:22.840
<i>Game over, Gaybol.</i>

45:23.160 --> 45:24.280
It's hard, man.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.400
Yes!

45:27.800 --> 45:28.840
Oh, my God!

45:30.760 --> 45:32.360
Great, baby.

45:35.520 --> 45:36.400
Suck it.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.560
What a shame.

45:39.360 --> 45:42.320
Gaybol took too long to loosen up,

45:42.400 --> 45:44.600
he hid himself for too long.

45:44.680 --> 45:48.200
I feel for him. I'm not happy.

45:48.280 --> 45:50.720
It's no surprise, Gaybol,
that you are eighth place.

45:50.800 --> 45:53.160
It's a pity to say, but you're blocked.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.600
BLOCKED

46:00.560 --> 46:02.440
When you realize, it's gone.

46:02.520 --> 46:03.600
It goes so fast.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.440
In the end, life is fast.

46:12.800 --> 46:15.400
It seems it's gonna last forever,

46:15.480 --> 46:18.000
and when you realize, it's over.

46:19.760 --> 46:20.880
Game over.

46:21.440 --> 46:24.320
I don't even care I'm in seventh.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.760
What matters is that I wasn't blocked.

46:26.840 --> 46:29.000
You guys are gonna have to endure me.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.320
To endure me. I'm so sorry.

46:31.680 --> 46:35.520
What you can gather from that
is that you need allies.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.960
You need allies.

46:37.040 --> 46:39.880
-That's what saved Lucas ass.
-Yes.

46:40.600 --> 46:41.600
"Alert!"

46:41.960 --> 46:43.480
Man!

46:43.560 --> 46:47.760
I don't have the strength to react

46:47.840 --> 46:49.560
to any more surprises.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.080
"Before he leaves,

46:51.160 --> 46:54.280
Gaybol can meet someone in person."

46:56.520 --> 46:59.120
"Gaybol is on his way
to one of the apartments."

47:00.720 --> 47:02.520
I'll clean my house...

47:02.960 --> 47:05.320
What's up, Gaybol? Are you coming here?

47:08.960 --> 47:10.880
-Come on, man.
-He's not coming here.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.040
If he shows up here,

47:16.120 --> 47:18.320
then he really thinks I'm a catfish.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.760
Dear Lord.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.720
Did I hear something, or am I tripping?

47:33.800 --> 47:35.320
Gaybol, is that you?

47:38.080 --> 47:39.840
Marina it's not available.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.600
What's up, bro?

47:47.640 --> 47:49.800
Awesome! How are you, bro?

47:49.880 --> 47:52.400
-Can't believe it!
-That's awesome!

47:52.480 --> 47:55.520
-Nice to meet you.
-Congratulations on first place.

47:55.600 --> 47:58.960
-Let me see if it's really you.
-It is, bro!

47:59.320 --> 48:02.080
I swear I was thinking,
"Is it really him?"

48:02.160 --> 48:03.680
It's really me, man!

48:03.760 --> 48:05.760
But I have a little mustache now.

48:06.400 --> 48:07.440
Bro, what is "aggro"?

48:07.520 --> 48:11.080
It's when you're stressed, troubled.
Something on those lines.

48:11.160 --> 48:13.920
I would say, "What is aggro?"

48:14.000 --> 48:15.880
"No aggro" means "No stress".

48:15.960 --> 48:18.840
-Got it!
-When you are relaxed, calm.

48:18.920 --> 48:21.640
You got from last to first.

48:21.720 --> 48:22.720
Crazy, I know.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.920
-You're doing great.
-Here's the thing,

48:25.000 --> 48:28.200
like I told you, it was all about
being authentic.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.760
That's it, bro.
The game demands that you--

48:31.840 --> 48:33.920
I talk too much, so it's hard, you know?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.680
And you know what?

48:35.760 --> 48:38.480
Sometimes you'd say something,
then took that back.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.960
And what do you think about Lorayne?

48:41.040 --> 48:43.800
I think she's too focused
in being a couple,

48:43.880 --> 48:46.160
and kind of ignoring me.

48:46.240 --> 48:47.960
It's hard to know who's catfishing.

48:48.040 --> 48:50.080
-Very!
-I'm suspicious of everyone.

48:50.480 --> 48:53.560
I was sure that Julia wasn't.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.560
And I was sure you were.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.120
-Why?
-I don't know!

48:57.200 --> 48:59.240
Your hair-- I was like, "Man..."

48:59.320 --> 49:01.240
-They thought I was too.
-I was sure of it.

49:01.320 --> 49:04.080
At the beginning, right?
You saw it and said, "Catfish."

49:04.160 --> 49:06.600
But you are doing awesome. Keep going.

49:06.680 --> 49:08.760
You gonna get at the final.

49:08.840 --> 49:11.280
"No aggro." You won't "aggro" anything.

49:11.360 --> 49:13.880
JP is great, he's really nice.

49:13.960 --> 49:16.040
He has grown in the game.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.280
I'm cheering for JP.
I really want him to win.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.360
Bye. I'll see you in Bahia.

49:21.440 --> 49:24.080
-And you'll come to São Paulo, right?
-Sure.

49:24.160 --> 49:25.480
-Good luck.
-Thanks, bro.

49:25.560 --> 49:26.840
You can count on me.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.160
-Kick ass!
-I will.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.920
-Thanks, JP!
-A round of applause to you.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.280
-Thanks, bro.
-Good luck.

49:33.440 --> 49:36.720
It took me a while to figure people out.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.600
I couldn't backup what I was saying

49:38.680 --> 49:41.040
'cause I was going
in two opposite directions.

49:41.120 --> 49:42.800
I'm very happy about this visit.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.360
And surprised too. I would never guess.

49:45.720 --> 49:47.360
Great, dude. Man--

49:47.920 --> 49:49.160
Oh, my!

49:51.280 --> 49:52.320
<i>Hey, JP.</i>

49:52.400 --> 49:54.720
<i>Get up, cutie, the game isn't over yet!</i>

49:57.720 --> 49:59.720
ALERT!

49:59.800 --> 50:01.480
Jesus! Out of the blue!

50:01.560 --> 50:02.640
My blood pressure!

50:02.720 --> 50:03.840
It's not over.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.120
"Alert." Please stop.

50:06.200 --> 50:08.000
We can't even breathe in here.

50:09.680 --> 50:12.240
"Another player has to leave <i>The Circle."</i>

50:12.560 --> 50:13.960
What?

50:14.320 --> 50:16.920
Jeez!

50:17.480 --> 50:18.640
Dear Lord!

50:18.720 --> 50:20.720
Oh, my!

50:21.040 --> 50:25.480
It can't be. What is this?
Double elimination now?

50:26.320 --> 50:27.560
No!

50:27.640 --> 50:28.920
Is this for real?

50:29.800 --> 50:31.400
Brace yourself.

50:31.480 --> 50:33.320
Man, I'm screwed.

50:33.960 --> 50:36.240
That's tense, bro.

50:36.680 --> 50:39.200
I'm not ready to leave.

50:43.120 --> 50:47.280
Who's gonna be the next victim?

51:17.440 --> 51:20.160
