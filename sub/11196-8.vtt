00:19.720 --> 00:23.040
Hey. I thought you said
this was the main entrance.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.680
It is. We just need
to find a way to open this.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.600
- I do not recognise the symbols.
- It's Babylonian. Cuneiform.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.160
- It's incredible.
- What is?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.480
Unlike Phoenician Ugaritic cuneiform,
these are pictograms

00:37.600 --> 00:40.240
rather than representations
of sound symbols.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.800
- Does it say how to open the pyramid?
- Ziggurat.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.960
- Huh?
- You said pyramid. It's a ziggurat.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.240
- Yeah. Open the door.
- Well, it might not be so easy.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.640
- I gotta go back to Earth for a reference.
- How hard could it be?

00:57.760 --> 01:00.960
Very. It's a dead language.

01:01.040 --> 01:03.600
I doubt anyone's even
stood here for 3,000 years.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.360
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.640
- What you got there?
- Empty pack of cigarettes.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.840
They're Russian.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.800
- (Hammond) Major?
- The Russian Stargate lasted 37 days.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.840
We've seen their logs and the planets they
visited, and P2X-338 was not one of them.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.760
Perhaps they deceived us.

02:33.880 --> 02:38.520
All they're admitting to is there may have
been some unauthorised use of their gate.

02:39.720 --> 02:42.120
What's that supposed to mean?

02:42.240 --> 02:45.200
This is Major Valentine Kirensky.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.640
He was serving under Colonel Sokalov
at the base in Siberia.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.320
It now appears that
he was also taking secret orders

02:54.440 --> 02:57.840
from certain hardline elements
in Russian Army lntelligence.

02:57.960 --> 03:02.640
He disappeared six days before we were
called in to deactivate the Russian gate.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.640
- They think he went off world?
- With two other officers

03:05.720 --> 03:09.400
and an archaeologist
named Alexander Britski.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.840
I know his work. He's an expert
on ancient Mesopotamia.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.880
Why go behind Sokalov's back?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.440
Perhaps for the same reason the NID
conducted secret offworld operations.

03:20.520 --> 03:24.960
- To steal alien technology at any cost.
- Why 338, as opposed to another planet?

03:25.320 --> 03:27.680
That has yet to be determined.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.360
If they used the gate before the others
were killed, they could still be there.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.440
It's doubtful they'd have survived.

03:34.560 --> 03:38.520
The planet's surface temperature
averages 135ÂºF in the shade.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.040
Shade? I don't remember shade.

03:42.440 --> 03:47.200
- They could have sheltered in the temple.
- They figured out how to open the door?

03:47.320 --> 03:49.280
I'll figure out the door.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.200
- Should they not have tried to return?
- Not without exposing their operation.

03:55.320 --> 04:00.520
- They could be waiting for a signal.
- Good point. Russians can be hard-core.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.200
They'd wait for ever
before violating protocol.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.160
I'm aware of that, Colonel.

04:05.240 --> 04:11.040
That's why we're letting a second Russian
team accompany you back to the planet.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.720
- Excuse me?
- It's going to be a joint mission.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.640
Full disclosure, full cooperation.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.440
May I ask why, sir?

04:20.760 --> 04:23.960
The Russians have been
pushing for more involvement

04:24.080 --> 04:26.640
in the Stargate programme
for quite some time.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.400
We've been resisting, but in this case
it might be useful to have them on board.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.880
Yes. Well, General, you know
I'm a big fan of the Russians,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.760
and international relations
are a bit of a hobby of mine.

04:39.640 --> 04:44.280
However, I do believe that
SG-1 should handle this one... alone.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.080
The decision's been made, Colonel.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.400
They're on their way.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.840
Yes, sir.

04:59.480 --> 05:03.240
- Because we have an agreement, sir.
- You see them holdin' up their end of it?

05:03.360 --> 05:05.400
Well, have we?

05:06.240 --> 05:07.200
No.

05:07.320 --> 05:11.280
If Thor's ship hadn't crashed, we'd
never have told them about the Stargate.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.560
Hey, whose side are you on?

05:13.680 --> 05:16.560
I'm just saying we should
at least tryto work together.

05:16.640 --> 05:20.520
Carter, you gotta know your
team members are watchin' your six.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.240
Actually, in Russian
they'd be watching your shest.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.400
- What?
- Which is neither here nor there.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.480
- Figured out how to open that pyramid?
- Ziggurat.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.000
And, yes, I think I have.

05:33.160 --> 05:37.360
The Russians e-mailed me the entire
report of their archaeologist, Dr Britski.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.600
The temple is dedicated to
the Babylonian god Marduk.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.960
- And Marduk was a Goa'uld?
- Well, it seems likely.

05:44.080 --> 05:49.000
Babylon means "gate of the gods", so
if there is a link, it wouldn't surprise me.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.080
(phone rings)

05:51.880 --> 05:53.680
Hello.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.760
Yeah, OK.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.960
The Russians are coming.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.880
Ugh.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.960
(speaks Russian)

06:11.160 --> 06:14.840
- Nice view.
- Oh, yeah. Colonel.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.680
Good morning, gentlemen.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.320
- And ma'am. There's a ma'am, sir.
- At ease.

06:22.640 --> 06:26.680
- You must be Colonel Zukhov.
- It's a pleasure, General Hammond.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.440
Allow me to introduce Major Vallarin,

06:29.520 --> 06:32.640
and Lieutenants Marchenko and Tolinev.

06:32.840 --> 06:36.280
Welcome to Stargate Command.
This is Colonel Jack O'Neill,

06:36.400 --> 06:40.600
Major Samantha Carter,
Dr Daniel Jackson and Teal'c.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.920
The famous Colonel O'Neill.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.480
Mm-hm.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.160
I believe we have a mutual friend.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.120
- We do?
- Dr Svetlana Markov.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.680
Ah.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.560
She spoke very highly of all of you.

06:56.600 --> 07:01.120
Before we proceed, perhaps you'd like
to get some rest and something to eat.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.800
We took the precaution
of eating before we came.

07:03.880 --> 07:09.000
What Colonel Zukhov means is that we'd
like to get to work as quickly as possible.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.400
Very well.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.960
Dr Jackson?

07:24.200 --> 07:29.480
Two years ago Dr Britski began an
excavation near Rafhah in southern lraq.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.400
He found tablets engraved
with Babylonian cuneiform,

07:32.480 --> 07:35.120
and one with a set of symbols
he didn't recognise.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.800
- Gate coordinates.
- In fact, the coordinates for P2X-338.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.200
Someone must've
recognised something,

07:44.280 --> 07:48.040
because the results of the dig were
never published. It became classified.

07:48.160 --> 07:53.160
Wait a minute. Two years ago
the Russians hadn't even seen a Stargate.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.320
But they did have a DHD.

07:55.440 --> 07:59.400
The one discovered by the Germans
in 1906 and taken by the Red Army.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.240
So when they got their programme
running, they must have added P2X-338

08:03.360 --> 08:06.840
to the list of addresses
supplied by Colonel Maybourne.

08:07.880 --> 08:11.760
That doesn't explain why
they didn't just send a regular team.

08:12.320 --> 08:16.680
Did Dr Britski find anything that might
suggest why they singled this planet out?

08:16.800 --> 08:20.680
With the coordinates, the tablet included
a reference to the "Eye of Tiamat".

08:20.800 --> 08:25.600
It was a large jewel, which supposedly
endowed Marduk with magical abilities.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.760
That wouldn't be why
you folks wanted to keep this quiet?

08:29.840 --> 08:35.600
Need I remind you, Colonel, the US has
operated a Stargate in secret for years

08:35.720 --> 08:38.760
with the express purpose
of obtaining alien technology?

08:38.840 --> 08:41.960
That was before we had
an agreement to share information.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.640
You took it upon yourselves
to represent the interests of the planet

08:45.760 --> 08:47.720
without consulting anyone.

08:47.840 --> 08:52.400
- You exposed the world to many dangers.
- At least we dealt with them.

08:53.320 --> 08:57.080
It only took you, what, a month
to find something you couldn't handle.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.160
Gentlemen, please.

08:59.280 --> 09:03.080
We seem to have gone
a little bit off topic here.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.160
Dr Jackson, what about the entrance?

09:06.600 --> 09:08.560
- Can you get us inside?
- Yeah.

09:08.680 --> 09:13.880
The engravings on the entrance are a kind
of code. It's like a giant combination lock.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.760
It's a matter of activating the correct
symbols in the proper sequence.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.480
I have the utmost confidence
in your abilities, Doctor.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.560
You have a go.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.800
Swell.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.000
Is that a P90, Colonel?

09:36.120 --> 09:41.080
50-round horizontal clip,
900 armour-piercing rounds per minute.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.440
Feel the weight of that sucker.

09:45.400 --> 09:49.880
Impressive. Though I prefer
the Russian Zastava M85.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.640
Those are made in Yugoslavia,
aren't they?

09:54.200 --> 09:56.760
Chevron seven locked.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.960
SG-1 , move out.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.760
(speaks Russian)

10:17.480 --> 10:19.440
What was that all about?

10:19.560 --> 10:21.840
I was just wishing them the best of luck.

10:24.440 --> 10:28.320
Right. Look, Zukhov,
let's get something straight here.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.200
I'm the ranking senior officer
in this mission.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.720
This is a joint operation
and we are of equal rank.

10:34.840 --> 10:38.040
So you should appreciate the need
for a clear chain of command.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.880
- Of course.
- (Hammond) Colonel!

10:42.600 --> 10:44.720
Is there a problem?

10:44.840 --> 10:46.800
No, sir.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.600
After you.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.920
- Daniel?
- Just about there.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.120
You said that an hour ago.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.040
Look, if you wanna
give this a try, be my guest.

11:42.120 --> 11:45.760
- Carter, break out the C4.
- (Daniel) Wait, wait, wait, wait!

11:47.200 --> 11:49.160
OK, I got it.

11:49.280 --> 11:53.160
It's a standard retelling of
the Babylonian creation myth.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.600
Marduk slays the winged serpent, Tiamat.
He cuts her in two.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.520
He uses half of her to create the sky
and the other half to create the earth.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.760
How does that help us, Dr Jackson?

12:02.880 --> 12:05.600
Some text has been
deliberately placed out of order.

12:05.680 --> 12:09.640
Only a priest of Marduk would
be able to spot the discrepancies.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.160
Here.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.200
Here.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.320
And... here.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.880
(rumbling)

12:59.640 --> 13:01.720
Nice job.

13:20.080 --> 13:25.040
- (Carter) This doesn't seem very stable.
- (Daniel) It's over 4,000 years old.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.440
- Which way?
- I don't know.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.960
We should split up.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.760
You take your team down here
and we'll go down there.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.160
All right, but Teal'c goes with you.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.520
For your own protection.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.800
And perhaps you should take
Lieutenant Marchenko.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.520
For the same reason.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.600
Fine. Move out.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.560
(gives orders in Russian)

14:08.920 --> 14:10.880
Colonel.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.520
Identify yourself.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.600
(Marchenko speaks Russian)

14:32.400 --> 14:34.200
Oh.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.840
- One of yours?
- Da.

14:45.040 --> 14:50.800
If these men disappeared ten months ago,
how could one decompose that fast?

14:50.920 --> 14:52.880
It didn't decompose.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.600
- Skeleton's covered in tiny teeth marks.
- Something ate this guy?

14:58.920 --> 15:01.400
Stripped the flesh right from his bones.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.080
(speaks Russian)

15:04.160 --> 15:06.200
You can say that again.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.960
It appears to be a sarcophagus.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.200
Zukhov, this is O'Neill.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.680
What is it, Colonel?

15:57.800 --> 16:00.600
We found one of Kirensky's men.
He's dead.

16:04.440 --> 16:09.440
- Exercise extreme caution.
- Understood. We found a sarcophagus.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.360
- We're investigating.
- Negative.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.120
Hold your positions till we get there.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.200
Zukhov, respond. Zukhov!

16:20.120 --> 16:22.920
(speaks Russian)

16:27.240 --> 16:29.200
Damn it. Fall back.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.600
You are disobeying a direct order.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.080
I trust Colonel O'Neill
won't take it personally.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.400
(click)

16:48.120 --> 16:50.760
- (curses in Russian)
- (rumbling)

16:52.360 --> 16:54.320
(shouts in Russian)

16:59.160 --> 17:01.120
(all shouting)

17:21.920 --> 17:24.119
- Hey! Get outta there!
- Marchenko!

17:24.240 --> 17:25.960
Argh!

17:46.000 --> 17:50.200
Interesting trap. Doesn't protect
the sarcophagus, but locks you in with it.

17:50.280 --> 17:54.400
- I told you to hold your position.
- We must thoroughly explore the area.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.040
I gave you an order!

17:58.200 --> 18:01.320
Someone would have
set off this trap eventually.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.600
It is just as well.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.160
One of your own men is dead.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.760
Where I come from, that tends
to make a commander a little upset!

18:09.880 --> 18:13.520
Where I come from,
casualties are to be expected.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.080
What?

18:16.200 --> 18:19.680
- We still need to find a way out of here.
- (crumbling)

18:21.640 --> 18:24.880
Shouldn't we open this first,
make sure there's no one home?

18:25.000 --> 18:28.760
- Teal'c, ever seen anything like this?
- Indeed I have not.

18:28.880 --> 18:32.760
It's like someone tried to seal
the sarcophagus from the outside.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.640
Kirensky's team must have
cut it open with a blowtorch.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.680
Open it up.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.880
There's no crystal.
There's no button to open it.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.360
Oh, for cryin' out loud! I'll do it myself.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.160
Pull.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.640
So much for Marduk.

19:16.840 --> 19:20.120
I thought a sarcophagus
could keep one alive indefinitely.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.840
- Perhaps it malfunctioned.
- I don't think that's what killed him.

19:23.960 --> 19:28.240
These bones exhibit the same markings
as the skeleton we found.

19:28.360 --> 19:32.400
Whatever killed the Russian soldier
killed the Goa'uld as well.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.600
How'd it get in there?

19:34.720 --> 19:36.680
I don't know.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.480
Better question is, where is it now?

19:49.040 --> 19:51.000
(scraping)

20:11.920 --> 20:16.120
- Sir, we've got a problem.
- We've got a lot. Be more specific.

20:16.360 --> 20:20.480
We can stretch out our food rations,
but our water's limited to five days.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.960
We won't be here that long.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.040
So now what do we do?

20:26.160 --> 20:29.920
We can use plastic explosive
to blast a hole in the entrance.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.960
Yeah, that might work.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.920
Might also bury us
under a ton of ziggurat.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.400
The colonel is right, Major.

20:40.520 --> 20:44.160
The time has not yet come
for such desperate measures.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.400
What about this writing?
Any mention of a back door?

20:50.520 --> 20:54.160
No. This portion of the text
deals with the final fate of Marduk.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.000
I think we know the final fate of Marduk.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.240
Apparently he was so evil
his priests rebelled against him.

21:00.320 --> 21:05.280
They sealed him in the sarcophagus
and placed some thing in there with him.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.520
There's no direct translation, but I assume
it refers to the creature that ate him.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.520
He was eaten alive?

21:12.960 --> 21:17.720
The sarcophagus would've tried to keep
him alive, so it would've taken a while.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.280
(speaks Russian)

21:21.600 --> 21:24.920
OK. That's officially the worst way to go.

21:25.040 --> 21:29.480
- It would seem his fate is well deserved.
- Marduk would have died eventually,

21:29.560 --> 21:35.560
but the creature must've stayed alive until
Major Kirensky and his men came along.

21:35.680 --> 21:38.160
They let it out. It killed them.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.400
We've only found one body.

21:41.920 --> 21:46.120
All right, here's the deal. We're
gonna search this place top to bottom.

21:46.240 --> 21:51.200
We're lookin' for a way out and the rest
of Kirensky's team. Everybody got that?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.560
I'd like to stay and finish this translation.
It might be useful.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.760
Fine. The rest of us'll pair off.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.680
Teal'c, you're with Zukhov. Carter
with Tolinev. Major, you're with me.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.760
Yes, sir.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.360
Hold it. I got something.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.960
What is it?

22:46.200 --> 22:49.440
It looks like some
sort of cocoon. It's empty.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.720
What is it?

22:55.840 --> 22:57.800
I thought I heard something.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.080
It's Britski.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.880
O'Neill.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.040
Yeah, go ahead.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.760
Colonel Zukhov and I have found
additional skeletal remains,

23:23.880 --> 23:26.440
along with equipment and personal items.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.600
Any sign of... a creature?

23:32.280 --> 23:35.240
- Negative.
- Colonel O'Neill, this is Zukhov.

23:35.320 --> 23:38.040
I have what appears to be
Britski's personal log.

23:38.320 --> 23:41.440
All right, take it back to Daniel.
We'll have him look at it.

23:41.560 --> 23:43.520
Very well.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.520
Colonel Zukhov.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.560
Coming.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.440
(scuttling)

24:18.200 --> 24:20.320
There it is again.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.640
(Carter) I don't see anything.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.080
It's around here somewhere.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.280
(screeching)

24:37.600 --> 24:39.560
Daniel, report!

24:40.360 --> 24:41.760
It's not me.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.040
Carter, what's your situation?

24:47.360 --> 24:49.320
(gunfire)

24:55.720 --> 24:57.680
- Carter!
- I'm all right.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.600
- What happened?
- The creature attacked us.

25:01.920 --> 25:05.720
- I think she's going into shock.
- Get her to the main chamber. Teal'c.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.120
Sir, it's still alive.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.320
Well, we'll kill it.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.320
No, that's not what I mean.
I sensed a presence.

25:20.120 --> 25:25.000
- What are you talking about?
- The Goa'uld symbiote. It's still alive.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.080
It's inside that thing.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.520
The creature must have injected her
with venom. Her body's shutting down.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.680
- What can we do?
- I've given her epinephrine for now.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.760
If we don't get her back to
the SGC soon, she won't make it.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.200
She's right.

25:49.320 --> 25:53.760
The same thing happened to the other
team, according to Dr Britski's journal.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.160
The creature escaped the sarcophagus,
attacked Kirensky,

25:57.280 --> 25:59.280
he was dead within two hours.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.600
Any mention of the others?

26:02.720 --> 26:05.920
Two people died
when a passageway collapsed...

26:06.040 --> 26:10.080
And... the last entry reads:

26:10.160 --> 26:14.840
"I'm all alone now. There is no escape.
Only one course of action remains."

26:15.480 --> 26:19.840
A cyanide pill. They were given
to all Russian Stargate personnel.

26:22.560 --> 26:25.000
Colonel, we no longer have a choice.

26:25.120 --> 26:29.560
- We must use the C4.
- We're not done searching yet, Colonel.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.920
- Tolinev is running out of time.
- I'm well aware of that, Colonel.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.120
But we risk no more lives
until we've exhausted our options.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.040
Hey.

26:40.120 --> 26:44.760
Look at this. It's a sketch of an artefact
Dr Britski found inside the sarcophagus.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.840
He thought it might be the Eye of Tiamat.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.120
Find anything like this with the journal?

26:54.520 --> 26:59.080
- There was nothing but old equipment.
- Then where is it?

26:59.200 --> 27:03.880
Colonel, surely the recovery
of this artefact is no longer a priority.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.200
It never was a priority.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.120
This was supposed to be
a rescue mission.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.320
It would appear
there is no one left to rescue.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.400
Well, I wouldn't say that.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.400
- Looks like blood.
- (crumbling)

27:34.480 --> 27:36.280
Indeed.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.760
Colonel, this is Carter.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.280
Yeah, go ahead.

27:42.400 --> 27:47.200
Sir, Teal'c and I found traces ofblood.
I think I may have wounded the creature.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.120
Won't its snake fix it?

27:51.480 --> 27:53.600
Depends on how bad the injury is, sir.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.640
All right. Stay sharp.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.680
How is she?

28:07.800 --> 28:10.040
Her pulse is getting weak.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.720
(scuttling)

28:18.200 --> 28:20.000
Did you hear that?

28:20.160 --> 28:21.560
What?

28:21.640 --> 28:23.600
(scuttling)

28:27.640 --> 28:29.600
Wait here.

28:32.160 --> 28:36.600
Yes, you go down the dark hallway alone
and I'll wait here in a dark room alone.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.360
(scuttling)

29:24.840 --> 29:26.840
A dead end.

29:26.960 --> 29:31.080
Yeah. I guess we should have
considered taking that left.

29:31.480 --> 29:35.040
Colonel, we both know
there's only one way out of here.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.480
Any blast big enough to put a hole in that
door is gonna bring everything down.

29:39.680 --> 29:43.000
- I'm willing to take the chance.
- Yeah, well, I'm not.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.920
What about Lieutenant Tolinev?

29:47.240 --> 29:49.240
Aren't casualties to be expected?

29:49.520 --> 29:52.960
It's obvious you're not capable
of taking the necessary risks.

29:53.080 --> 29:57.280
No, we take risks.
But we don't hand out cyanide pills.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.560
And we don't leave our people behind.

30:27.320 --> 30:31.280
Is it just me, or have we been
down this passageway before?

30:31.400 --> 30:33.360
Indeed we have.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.240
This place is like a maze.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.040
- Perhaps we should return...
- (gasps)

30:43.280 --> 30:46.080
It's not moving. I'm not sensing anything.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.120
Nor am l.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.480
There is no symbiote inside this creature.

31:19.720 --> 31:24.000
It could have left the body when
it realised it couldn't heal the wound.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.080
It would not survive for long
under those circumstances.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.440
Unless it found a new host.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.600
- (Carter) Colonel O'Neill.
- Go ahead.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.600
We found the creature. It's dead.

32:11.680 --> 32:15.640
- That's good news.
- Only problem is the symbiote's not in it.

32:17.040 --> 32:20.080
- That's a bit disconcerting.
- Sir, as you know,

32:20.200 --> 32:24.640
Teal'c's body cannot sustain a symbiote
as long as he carries a larval Goa'uld.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.040
And he doesn't sense
a Goa'uld in me, so...

32:28.000 --> 32:32.680
that leaves Daniel, Major Vallarin
and... well, the two ofyou, sir.

32:37.360 --> 32:40.160
- Drop the weapon.
- I don't think so.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.880
- I know it's not me.
- And I know it's not me.

32:52.120 --> 32:53.520
Colonel, respond.

32:58.960 --> 33:02.760
Get back to the main chamber.
Check on Daniel and Vallarin.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.560
- I'll see you there in a bit.
- Roger that, sir.

33:09.960 --> 33:13.000
I'm not kiddin', Zukhov. I'll shoot ya.

33:13.120 --> 33:17.080
- This is beginning to make sense.
- Is it?

33:17.160 --> 33:19.200
If you were the Goa'uld,

33:19.320 --> 33:23.040
you might not want to leave
until you found the Eye of Tiamat.

33:23.160 --> 33:26.200
It would explain your reluctance
to use explosives.

33:26.320 --> 33:30.600
And if you were the Goa'uld and you'd
been stuck in this dump for 2,000 years,

33:30.720 --> 33:34.320
you might not think about anything
except getting out of here.

33:34.440 --> 33:38.640
Which would explain why you're willing
to take such an insane risk.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.000
Then it would seem we have a problem.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.920
Daniel.

34:15.040 --> 34:18.920
Hey, guys. I just finished
translating this section... Whoa!

34:20.679 --> 34:23.040
Hey, what's up?

34:23.520 --> 34:27.159
- I do not sense the presence of a Goa'uld.
- Me neither.

34:27.520 --> 34:31.639
- Well, thank you.
- So what were you gonna say?

34:31.960 --> 34:36.159
I was gonna say that I just finished
translating a section of the text.

34:36.239 --> 34:41.159
It says Marduk used to emerge from his
temple and appear amongst his people,

34:41.280 --> 34:44.000
riding a beam of white light.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.040
- A ring transporter?
- Yeah.

34:46.480 --> 34:49.719
There's a good chance
it might be right here in this room.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.960
- Colonel Zukhov?
- In here.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.800
What is this?

35:08.920 --> 35:13.120
- (speaks Russian)
- Don't be an idiot, Zukhov.

35:13.240 --> 35:16.200
- It could just as well be him.
- (distorted) Very true.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.720
Oh, man!

35:35.400 --> 35:37.720
Where is the Eye of Tiamat?

35:39.080 --> 35:41.320
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:41.440 --> 35:46.240
You forget, Colonel, that
I retain all the knowledge of my host.

35:46.360 --> 35:51.800
And he was well aware of your
secret orders to obtain alien technology.

35:51.960 --> 35:56.000
You were to bring the Eye
back to your superiors.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.440
I have no secret orders.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.120
You lie.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.640
Yup. It's here.

36:16.760 --> 36:20.960
- We gotta tell the colonel.
- Not until we're sure he's not a Goa'uld.

36:21.800 --> 36:26.080
- Teal'c, what are you doing?
- We must find a way to engage the rings.

36:26.160 --> 36:27.960
Right.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.320
An interesting weapon.

36:45.240 --> 36:50.840
It's obviously capable of inflicting
severe pain, as well as death.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.840
Shall I test it on your new friend?

36:56.960 --> 36:59.200
Stop.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.440
I have the Eye.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.760
Give it to me and I will spare you.

37:06.840 --> 37:09.240
What are you doing?

37:09.360 --> 37:12.320
I'm sorry, Colonel.
I was acting under orders.

37:13.160 --> 37:14.960
Don't give it to him. Don't.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.280
No one else will die because of me.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.920
Give me the Eye.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.360
Take it!

37:32.600 --> 37:34.400
Jeez!

37:37.520 --> 37:40.760
- What's that?
- Colonel O'Neill?

37:56.080 --> 37:57.560
Colonel O'Neill?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.440
Yeah, I'm OK.

38:00.520 --> 38:04.400
- What happened?
- The Goa'uld was in Vallarin.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.840
Zukhovjust... took him out
with a grenade.

38:09.440 --> 38:13.920
We found a ring transporter. Daniel says
it'll take us to another temple nearby.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.960
All right. I'll be there in a minute.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.080
(footsteps)

38:30.040 --> 38:33.160
I do not sense the presence of a Goa'uld.

38:33.280 --> 38:36.720
Well, good.
And I'm fine, by the way, thanks.

38:36.840 --> 38:40.600
- How's Tolinev?
- OK, if we get out soon. Where's Zukhov?

38:41.720 --> 38:43.680
He didn't make it.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.240
One thing left to do here.

39:04.080 --> 39:07.680
- Right, all set. Let's go.
- Colonel O'Neill!

39:08.160 --> 39:09.800
I will have my revenge.

39:10.160 --> 39:13.600
You know, you guys always say that.

39:32.040 --> 39:35.000
(speaks Russian)

39:36.240 --> 39:38.040
Yes.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.360
Colonel.

39:49.640 --> 39:52.600
Lieutenant Tolinev
corroborates your story.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.240
So she was telling the truth.

39:55.360 --> 39:59.960
She will be debriefed again in Moscow,
where she can speak more freely.

40:00.080 --> 40:04.040
- I'm sure you'll be able to get her to say...
- Colonel, this isn't the time.

40:04.160 --> 40:09.000
General, Zukhov's secret orders put us
all in jeopardy. I want that on the record.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.480
Your opinion is already
a matter of public record, Colonel.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.160
So is the fact that all your team survived,

40:15.280 --> 40:18.480
yet only one Russian soldier
made it back alive - barely.

40:18.600 --> 40:21.920
If your people understood
the concept of chain of command...

40:22.040 --> 40:24.920
We are agreed. You were in command.

40:25.040 --> 40:28.280
We also know which lives
you were willing to sacrifice.

40:28.400 --> 40:33.280
We regret the loss of life and offer
our condolences to the officers' families.

40:33.400 --> 40:37.040
I'm sure you also regret this
Eye of Tiamat was buried with Zukhov,

40:37.160 --> 40:39.120
never to be recovered?

40:40.160 --> 40:41.800
Yes, we do.

40:46.080 --> 40:50.440
Perhaps it is best to admit
we both made mistakes, huh?

40:50.520 --> 40:53.000
Be better if you admitted you screwed up.

40:53.120 --> 40:57.320
- I will pass that sentiment along, Colonel.
- Yeah, please do.

40:57.440 --> 41:01.000
I'm sure this will have no bearing
on our future participation.

41:01.120 --> 41:04.160
I wouldn't count on
future participation if I were you.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.080
No? I would.

41:13.240 --> 41:17.440
