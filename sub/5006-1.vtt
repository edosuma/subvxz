01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.752
She calls it a bloody samosa or something.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.879
- "Semester."
- Whatever. Anyway, to check the reality,

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.396
I had a sneaky look
in her diary for Friday's entry.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.040
KATE: Don't do that.
DRIPPY: Shut up and listen.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:46.635
"I think, deep breath, I kind of love them
like proper friends I've known forever.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.678
"They've made me say words
like "horridious" and "herbal."

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:53.116
"Which is sort of whack, and I'd probably
hate them if I wasn't one of them.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.919
"But I like that I am now one of them."

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.112
Apart from some
atrocious spelling mistakes,

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.954
it's all a bit more kosher, don't you think?

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.077
And now she's going to get thrown out.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.871
It is your duty

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.919
to understand the dark forces
that drove a seemingly...

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.231
Harriet? May I remind you
that the Honour Court

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.515
is no place
for your personal grandstanding,

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.670
and that Poppy has a right to speak
in her own defence

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.274
before the Court as a whole
passes judgement?

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.396
Thank you, Mrs Kingsley.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.198
I won't insult everybody
by trying to defend myself or my actions.

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:44.838
So, I think it's safe to say that
I've really messed up.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:50.472
And I apologise profusely.
But I'm also so grateful to you all.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.600
I tried really hard to
get out of this school,

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.559
and only now do I realise
just how much I want to stay.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.997
I've learnt so much being here.
Being with all of you.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.073
And in some ways being with my mom,

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.631
who I found out was actually a student here.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.029
I've had a hole in my heart for five years,

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:21.752
and somehow being here,
it slowly started to heal.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.913
I know I may have looked
like a California girl,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.278
but in my heart I've discovered
that I really am an Abbey Mount girl.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.469
Objection! Sustained.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.518
The court will heretofore disregard
the previous statement

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.115
and perhaps heretofore
we can begin the real business.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.760
Can you tell us, in your own words,

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.149
where were you
on the aforementioned evening of...

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.277
Honestly, Harriet.
Who else's words do you expect her to use?

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.832
- Just leave this to me.
- Right. Sustained.

01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:00.595
Poppy, were you in the cook's sitting room
on the night of the fire?

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.796
Yes, I was.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.111
- Were you there with permission?
- No. I was not.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:13.038
- Quiet, please. Silence in court.
- Did you intend on starting a fire?

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.315
- Not really.
- Objection!

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.154
- Does the defendant mean yes or no?
- Harriet.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.391
It means no,
I had no intention of actually doing it.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.359
- Was anyone else with you?
- Not as far as I know.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.919
I was.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.234

- I was.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.270
This is ridiculous!
What are you all doing? You're lying.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.114
- They're lying, Mrs Kingsley.
- Harriet, you're going down, biatch.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:00.159
This is a conspiracy.
You can't expel the whole year,

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:05.792
- and they know that.
- Be quiet, Harriet! Sit down, everyone.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:10.556
It's a black-and-white case.
She has to be expelled.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.475
The girl set fire to the school,
endangering all our precious lives.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:20.236
She walked in there, lighter at the ready,
and tried to burn the place down.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.550
- Lighter?
- Not now, Jane.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.394
- Have respect for court protocol.
- What lighter, Harriet?

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.438
Jesus, Charlotte,
how daft can you possibly be?

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:35.157
That ridiculous "I heart LA" lighter of hers.
She left it behind, for God's sakes.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:41.634
Except, how do you know that, Harriet?
No one's mentioned a lighter before.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.393
What? Yes, they have.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:50.394
- Objection.
- Actually, Harriet, they haven't.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:56.191
I have to second Jane's question, Harriet.
How did you know about that lighter?

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.110
HARRIET: Well, I...

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.078
Freddie found the lighter
before anyone saw it.

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.756
How could you possibly know unless...
Unless you were there?

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.037
This is absurd. I refuse to sit
here and listen to these wild...

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:17.069
I had put it out. And I heard footsteps.
It must have been you.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.038
Oh, my God.
You restarted the fire, didn't you?

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.793
- Harriet, is this true?
- Of course not.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:27.795
It all makes sense now. I knew it.
I think I'm innocent.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:30.075
- We think so, too.
- You're not!
