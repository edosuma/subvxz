WEBVTT

00:01.137 --> 00:02.340
All right. Let's go, guys.

00:02.341 --> 00:03.551
You know the movie night rules... 

00:03.552 --> 00:05.098
If you're late you're not
allowed to point at the screen

00:05.099 --> 00:06.471
and ask, "who's that guy?"

00:07.963 --> 00:10.452
Uhp, sorry, guys, but I'm out.

00:10.453 --> 00:13.186
Vanessa and I are going clubbing.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.728
Yeah, we finally discovered
the secret to our relationship.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.123
Go to places where it's too loud to talk.

00:19.568 --> 00:20.807
I'm out too.

00:20.808 --> 00:22.325
Amy and I are celebrating something.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.557
I just hope I remember what
that is before I pick her up.

00:25.991 --> 00:28.676
Movie night is a tradition.
You guys can't just bail.

00:28.677 --> 00:31.233
Really? Because that's
exactly what you two did

00:31.234 --> 00:33.779
when you were dating Fitch and Megan.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.707
I believe the exact phrase was:

00:36.032 --> 00:37.467
"See ya, losers." (Chuckles)

00:38.227 --> 00:40.750
Yeah, so, "see ya, losers." (Chuckles)

00:42.269 --> 00:43.383
Okay.

00:43.384 --> 00:44.853
<i>- There is seriously something wrong... 
- (Door closes)</i>

00:44.854 --> 00:47.022
When we're the ones sitting
at home on a Friday night.

00:47.023 --> 00:48.804
Hey, not to worry. I'm sure we'll manage

00:48.805 --> 00:50.477
to have plenty of fun without them.

00:50.478 --> 00:52.936
Exactly. How cute are you.

00:52.937 --> 00:54.168
Oh-ho!

00:56.587 --> 00:58.534
Oh, you were talking to Emma, weren't you?

00:59.385 --> 01:00.747
(Chuckles weakly) Yeah.

01:00.748 --> 01:02.428
But you look pretty cute too.

01:06.176 --> 01:08.215
So, uh, should we get started?

01:09.113 --> 01:11.713
You know, you don't have to
sit all the way over there.

01:11.714 --> 01:13.444
Oh, right. Yeah yeah yeah, of course.

01:15.461 --> 01:17.497
They do not know what
they're missing out on.

01:17.498 --> 01:18.889
I mean, who's cooler than we are?

01:18.890 --> 01:20.445
(Scoffs) No one.

01:22.222 --> 01:24.153
I mean, we so don't need them. Right?

01:24.980 --> 01:26.340
No way.

01:27.924 --> 01:29.538
You comfortable?

01:29.539 --> 01:31.601
Most definitely.

01:31.602 --> 01:32.695
Great.

01:32.696 --> 01:34.122
Let's do this.

01:49.913 --> 01:51.537
Ben: So Danny, um... 

01:51.538 --> 01:53.652
I was just wondering if I
could get a little advice.

01:54.204 --> 01:55.954
Less squats, more biceps.

01:55.955 --> 01:57.426
You're starting to look
a little uneven, bro.

01:59.967 --> 02:02.099
That's all very helpful.
But this is about a girl.

02:02.603 --> 02:05.163
Well, I'm an expert when it
comes to the female persuasion.

02:05.715 --> 02:07.102
(Chuckles) You've come to the right place.

02:07.103 --> 02:08.360
It's about Riley.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.818
You've come to the wrong place.

02:10.293 --> 02:12.321
Dude, come on. She's your best friend.

02:12.322 --> 02:13.945
And I think she might like me.

02:13.946 --> 02:16.185
Really? You and Riley?

02:16.186 --> 02:17.538
I thought you were over that.

02:17.539 --> 02:19.011
I was over it.

02:19.012 --> 02:20.829
But that's only because I
thought she wasn't into it.

02:21.546 --> 02:23.549
But if she's into it, I ain't over it.

02:25.074 --> 02:26.343
And how do you know she's into it?

02:26.705 --> 02:28.366
Last night, when we were
sitting on the couch,

02:28.367 --> 02:31.405
I scooched in and she did not scooch out.

02:32.939 --> 02:35.911
You know the scooch test
is not 100% effective.

02:36.666 --> 02:37.862
But it's not just that.

02:38.169 --> 02:39.405
She gave me this look.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.480
And it wasn't just any look.

02:41.789 --> 02:44.137
For a second there, we
weren't just Riley and Ben.

02:44.138 --> 02:47.096
We were... Riley and Ben.

02:48.483 --> 02:50.105
Well, whatever you do,

02:50.106 --> 02:51.670
I just think you should take it slow.

02:52.182 --> 02:54.198
Slow... all right, okay.

02:54.199 --> 02:55.678
Slower than that!

02:57.009 --> 02:59.650
Just don't do or say
anything you're gonna regret.

02:59.651 --> 03:01.324
(Sighs deeply) Wow.

03:01.325 --> 03:03.389
You're really kinda tying
my hands on this one.

03:03.390 --> 03:04.684
But thanks, bro.

03:05.243 --> 03:06.289
<i>(Door opens)</i>

03:06.290 --> 03:08.053
Oh. Danny. Perfect.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.876
You are just the man we were looking for.

03:10.186 --> 03:11.483
We need some advice.

03:11.484 --> 03:13.492
Why not? Apparently, it's what I do.

03:14.568 --> 03:16.023
(Clears throat) Okay.

03:16.024 --> 03:17.154
So what do you think about this?

03:17.155 --> 03:18.994
You know how the Rangers
are one of the only

03:18.995 --> 03:20.694
pro hockey teams without a mascot?

03:20.695 --> 03:22.500
- Uh-huh. - And how
they're having a contest

03:22.501 --> 03:23.960
- to finally pick
one? - Uh-huh.

03:25.688 --> 03:26.976
We're entering!

03:28.341 --> 03:30.113
Uh-huh... 

03:32.027 --> 03:34.515
- We decided on kangaRoos... 
- Yeah.

03:34.516 --> 03:37.113
- But we're calling ourselves... 
- Wait.

03:37.830 --> 03:40.128
The Ranger-Roos.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.868
- (Chuckles)
- (Mimics gunshot)

03:43.259 --> 03:45.003
- That part was my idea, so... 
- Yeah.

03:45.740 --> 03:47.695
This part is my idea... No!

03:47.696 --> 03:49.891
You cannot be my team's mascot.

03:49.892 --> 03:52.423
Look, Danny, it's just a one-time thing.

03:52.424 --> 03:54.781
And besides, it's the only way
I'm gonna get to watch you play

03:54.782 --> 03:56.961
since I've been banned from
the next three home games.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.636
(Scoffs) You steal one zamboni.

03:59.637 --> 04:01.021
- I know.
- You know... 

04:02.136 --> 04:04.629
Look, and I'll finally be vindicated.

04:04.630 --> 04:07.735
I tried out to be my high school mascot
five times!

04:08.504 --> 04:10.161
Go salamanders!

04:10.943 --> 04:12.340
- Ow!
- Oh, God!

04:12.341 --> 04:13.507
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God.

04:13.508 --> 04:14.668
- Are you okay?
- Ow! I should have stretched.

04:14.669 --> 04:16.154
- You should have stretched.
- Oh, my God.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.420
Give it to me. Give it
to me. Give it to me.

04:17.421 --> 04:18.591
- Stretch me out.
- Stretch it, stretch it.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.755
- Stretch!
- (Screams)

04:20.755 --> 04:21.985
(High-pitched) Oh, my God!

04:22.296 --> 04:23.883
Look, Danny. I promise:

04:23.884 --> 04:25.789
We won't do anything to embarrass you.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.284
(Chanting) We hop, we've got a pouch!

04:32.285 --> 04:33.922
And we're big and strong!

04:35.566 --> 04:37.233

04:37.234 --> 04:38.811
- I'm kanga!
- I'm Roo!

04:38.812 --> 04:40.425
Both: And we're mascots too!

04:40.426 --> 04:41.942
So come to our games

04:41.943 --> 04:43.655
both: And we'll Root with you!

04:58.054 --> 04:59.101
So?

04:59.866 --> 05:02.419
- What do you think? Right?
- Huh.

- Am speechless.
- Yeah!

05:05.653 --> 05:07.543
- You loved it. You loved it!
- Yeah!

05:07.544 --> 05:09.471
Just so we're clear, you're
gonna have your heads on

05:09.472 --> 05:11.070
the entire time, right?

05:11.071 --> 05:12.426
- You never know.
- We don't know, we're artists.

05:12.427 --> 05:13.803
- You never know.
- We're artists.

05:14.445 --> 05:15.874
Okay! Big news, people.

05:15.875 --> 05:18.472
I just scored four tickets to the
junkyard bunnies concert tonight,

05:18.473 --> 05:20.608
and I'm inviting you, you and you.

05:21.997 --> 05:23.465
If you promise not to wear that.

05:24.633 --> 05:26.170
W-why are you wearing that?

05:26.171 --> 05:28.356
I believe it involves a
plot to destroy my life.

05:29.554 --> 05:30.542
Hey, mom, can you, uh... 

05:30.543 --> 05:31.942
Stay home alone with a sleeping baby

05:31.943 --> 05:33.768
while you guys go to a
concert and get drunk?

05:33.769 --> 05:35.166
Thanks, mom, you're the best.

05:36.415 --> 05:38.131
Come here, little Emma.

05:38.651 --> 05:40.525
You can sit in grandma's pouch

05:40.526 --> 05:42.046
and I'll tell you the story about the time

05:42.047 --> 05:43.654
I dated a short Australian.

05:46.190 --> 05:48.101
He was... (Australian accent
) A shrimp on the Bonnie.

05:48.919 --> 05:50.676
(Mouthing)

05:51.087 --> 05:52.114
Ben,

05:52.115 --> 05:54.011
how did you ever get tickets
to the junkyard bunnies?

05:54.012 --> 05:55.486
They're like the hottest band in the city.

05:55.487 --> 05:57.188
Well, I'll tell you what I didn't do... 

05:57.189 --> 06:00.342
Call all the radio stations and lie about
only having three months left to live.

06:00.343 --> 06:02.318
No, I did not! (Laughs)

06:03.622 --> 06:05.077
Oh, my God. I'm so so so excited!

06:05.078 --> 06:06.538
Okay, um, I'm gonna go home and change.

06:06.539 --> 06:08.008
I'll see you guys in an hour?

06:08.009 --> 06:09.300
- Perfect.
- Okay.

06:09.301 --> 06:11.502
Is it weird if I wear my Roo suit?

06:11.503 --> 06:13.487
You know, I need to get
comfortable in it enough,

06:13.488 --> 06:14.841
so that I don't even notice it's on.

06:16.107 --> 06:17.773
Not so fast, my furry little friend.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.923
I really only got two tickets.

06:19.924 --> 06:21.518
I'm taking Riley.

06:21.519 --> 06:23.337
You two just remembered that you
have plans that you can't get out of.

06:23.971 --> 06:26.132
What? How do you know I
can't get out of them?!

06:26.133 --> 06:27.691
I should at least try, right?

06:29.176 --> 06:30.350
Danny!

06:30.351 --> 06:32.034
I'm trying to test the waters with Riley.

06:32.035 --> 06:33.885
Riley? I thought you were over that.

06:34.273 --> 06:36.181
Apparently, she gave him a look.

06:36.182 --> 06:38.220
Don't forget about the scooch.

06:38.221 --> 06:39.765
Oh, a look and a scooch?

06:40.667 --> 06:42.710
Oh, shoot, man, you
better just go for it then.

06:44.309 --> 06:45.609
Thank you.

06:45.610 --> 06:47.309
I really just need tonight to seem casual

06:47.310 --> 06:48.603
and spontaneous.

06:48.929 --> 06:50.238
I'm thinking after the concert

06:50.239 --> 06:52.307
we go for a little
romantic walk in the park.

06:52.784 --> 06:55.520
Maybe get ourselves caught
in a little downpour,

06:55.822 --> 06:57.597
huddle under my coat,
until we finally end up

06:57.598 --> 06:58.931
at the bar for a nightcap.

07:00.090 --> 07:01.018
And then

07:01.423 --> 07:02.631
as she looks up at me,

07:03.232 --> 07:04.425
I smile at her

07:05.250 --> 07:07.846
and we share our first sweet kiss.

07:10.532 --> 07:12.497
And you think this outfit's embarrassing?

07:15.399 --> 07:17.649
No! Stupid rain.

07:17.650 --> 07:19.220
I can't believe I ruined my new boots.

07:19.528 --> 07:20.788
Yeah, sorry about that.

07:20.789 --> 07:22.620
I guess running around
with a jacket on our heads

07:22.621 --> 07:24.225
probably wasn't the best idea.

07:24.226 --> 07:25.821
(Chuckles) It's okay.

07:25.822 --> 07:26.948
It was fun.

07:26.949 --> 07:28.297
But you know, now that we're both single,

07:28.298 --> 07:29.861
we can totally do this again sometime.

07:31.298 --> 07:32.819
We'll see how long you
actually stay that way.

07:33.629 --> 07:34.806
Which way?

07:34.807 --> 07:36.479
Um, single?

07:36.480 --> 07:38.402
Ben. No offense,

07:38.403 --> 07:40.258
but you're kinda the hookup king.

07:41.064 --> 07:42.719
Normally, I would say thank you... 

07:43.779 --> 07:45.786
But I'm thinking about hanging up my crown.

07:46.088 --> 07:47.786
You know, try to find the right girl.

07:48.272 --> 07:49.267
Oh.

07:49.673 --> 07:51.185
I didn't know you were looking.

07:51.773 --> 07:53.407
Oh, I'm looking.

07:55.024 --> 07:56.380
But, you know, your track record

07:56.381 --> 07:58.377
isn't exactly anything to brag about.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.905
(Scoffs) Oh, yeah?

07:59.906 --> 08:01.601
And what's wrong with the
guys that I go out with?

08:01.602 --> 08:04.304
Nothing, I guess, if you like
guys with advanced degrees

08:04.305 --> 08:05.628
in bore-ology.

08:06.595 --> 08:08.151
(Scoffs) Oh, okay.

08:08.471 --> 08:10.767
Well, since you obviously know me so well,

08:11.099 --> 08:13.094
what kinda guy should I be going out with?

08:13.095 --> 08:14.476
Okay, off the top of my head,

08:14.782 --> 08:17.670
I'm thinking a guy... Handsome, funny,

08:18.152 --> 08:20.963
good taste in music, who maybe
takes an interest in your life.

08:20.964 --> 08:23.668
Hey, great concert tonight.
How's work going by the way?

08:26.702 --> 08:28.557
You really think I could do better?

08:29.132 --> 08:30.477
I do.

08:30.478 --> 08:31.768
I really do.

08:32.421 --> 08:33.365
Okay.

08:33.732 --> 08:35.289
Then I'm in your hands.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.121
Here? Now?

08:40.606 --> 08:41.919
Absolutely.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.782
I mean, since you're clearly an expert
in all things Riley.

08:45.247 --> 08:46.632
Find me the perfect guy.

08:48.056 --> 08:48.860
Wait.

08:49.518 --> 08:50.884
You want me to find you a date?

08:50.885 --> 08:51.798
(Chuckling) Yeah.

08:52.326 --> 08:53.707
It's gonna be fun.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.313
Thanks, Ben. You want another round?

08:58.560 --> 08:59.863
I hold her hand,

09:00.456 --> 09:02.129
I lean in for a sweet kiss... 

09:02.816 --> 09:05.860
And I set her up with another guy.
Well done, Wheeler.

09:08.135 --> 09:09.350
I'm sorry for waking you.

09:09.351 --> 09:10.890
But if there was ever
a time to call a meeting

09:10.891 --> 09:12.800
of the emergency crisis task force,

09:12.801 --> 09:13.949
it's now.

09:15.143 --> 09:16.643
So let me get this straight.

09:16.644 --> 09:18.407
You took Riley out on a fake date

09:18.408 --> 09:20.033
to see if she would go on a real date.

09:20.034 --> 09:21.981
But now you have to set
her up on the perfect date

09:21.982 --> 09:23.269
with someone else?

09:23.270 --> 09:24.713
You can see why I called the meeting.

09:25.985 --> 09:27.194
But here's the real problem:

09:27.195 --> 09:28.685
If I set her up with some loser,

09:28.686 --> 09:30.428
then she's gonna think
I don't know her at all.

09:30.429 --> 09:32.306
But if I set her up with some great guy,

09:32.307 --> 09:33.933
well, then she's going
out with a great guy.

09:34.417 --> 09:36.123
And how am I supposed to compete with that?

09:36.674 --> 09:37.930
You can't.

09:39.715 --> 09:43.184
Look, man, what you need
is a guy who seems great.

09:43.185 --> 09:46.338
But then turns out to be
a complete and total loser.

09:46.339 --> 09:49.782
Okay. Now that you can compete with.
(Chuckles)

09:53.872 --> 09:55.279
(Chanting) We are the Rangers.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.565
(Chanting) The Ranger-Roos.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.368
We're here to get you... 

09:58.369 --> 09:59.636
Into the gRoove.

10:00.001 --> 10:01.560
We're here to dance.

10:01.561 --> 10:02.648
We're here to sway.

10:02.972 --> 10:04.549
Both: You got a problem?

10:04.550 --> 10:06.146
Get out our way.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.713
Hop it to the Roo, yo.

10:08.174 --> 10:11.110
(Both vocalizing) ♪
hop it to the Roo, yo.

10:16.168 --> 10:19.184
Oh. Hey, guys. I got some bad news.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.961
I was bragging to the guys
at the front office about how

10:20.962 --> 10:22.912
you two were gonna sweep
the mascot competition... 

10:22.913 --> 10:24.242
- Oh... 
- Ohh.

10:25.367 --> 10:28.102
But then they told me, "no pairs allowed."

10:28.623 --> 10:30.064
- Really?
- Are you sure?

10:30.065 --> 10:31.618
Yeah, it's right here on the entry form.

10:31.619 --> 10:32.980
Section "c," sub-paragraph seven... 

10:32.981 --> 10:34.314
"No pairs." (Inhales sharply)

10:34.857 --> 10:35.887
That totally sucks.

10:36.245 --> 10:37.790
Yeah. I know.

10:38.168 --> 10:39.415
(Weakly) Shoot.

10:41.601 --> 10:42.701
You know what?

10:43.411 --> 10:44.903
You should do it.

10:44.904 --> 10:47.171
Yeah, you came up with
the whole kangaRoo idea.

10:47.927 --> 10:50.813
Yeah, but you're the one who
put "Ranger" and "oo" together.

10:50.814 --> 10:53.154
- I mean, we'd be nothing without that.
- You're right.

10:53.927 --> 10:55.120
You should do it.

10:55.121 --> 10:58.255
Well, I really hate this idea... 

10:59.118 --> 11:00.696
But maybe neither of you should do it.

11:02.011 --> 11:03.161
You know what? He's right.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.011
We're either in this together

11:05.012 --> 11:06.587
or not at all.

11:07.143 --> 11:08.705
Then it's not at all.

11:08.706 --> 11:10.088
It's the Ranger-Roo way.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.404
Yes!

11:14.975 --> 11:16.079
<i>Ben: All right, so you think you got this?</i>

11:16.542 --> 11:17.514
Yeah.

11:17.515 --> 11:19.300
You want me to pretend
to take your friend Riley

11:19.301 --> 11:20.977
on a date to a Rangers game.

11:20.978 --> 11:23.439
No, not just a date.
The perfect date, okay?

11:23.440 --> 11:26.416
Here's a list of all
her likes and dislikes.

11:26.725 --> 11:29.132
I need you to charm her, woo her... 

11:29.133 --> 11:30.054
And then drop her cold.

11:31.492 --> 11:33.033
Are you sure you like this girl?

11:34.352 --> 11:36.636
Would I be going to all this trouble
if I didn't? (Scoffs)

11:37.493 --> 11:39.067
Now this is the important part:

11:39.068 --> 11:40.685
When the horn goes off
after the first period,

11:41.013 --> 11:42.792
that's when you need
to tell her you just... 

11:43.303 --> 11:44.762
You can't do this.

11:44.763 --> 11:46.582
You just got a text
from your ex-girlfriend.

11:46.583 --> 11:47.921
I don't have an ex-girlfriend.

11:48.501 --> 11:50.094
And we're still pretending.

11:51.024 --> 11:52.765
- What's her name?
- Riley.

11:52.766 --> 11:54.205
No! My ex-girlfriend.

11:54.206 --> 11:55.976
Oh! Uh... Alice?

11:56.366 --> 11:58.049
Alice. Nice!

12:00.230 --> 12:02.061
And since you still
have feelings for Alice,

12:02.062 --> 12:03.817
it wouldn't be fair to Riley.

12:03.818 --> 12:06.452
But in your heart of hearts,
you know that she can do better.

12:06.829 --> 12:09.771
And then better swoops in
and picks up the pieces... 

12:09.772 --> 12:10.595
Over and done.

12:10.596 --> 12:11.717
But seriously, dude,

12:12.085 --> 12:13.812
why don't you ask this girl out?

12:13.813 --> 12:15.753
I just wanna make sure things
don't get too complicated.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.598
(Crowd cheering)

12:22.752 --> 12:24.948
(Crowd clamoring)

12:25.635 --> 12:27.354
Come on, Wheeler!

12:27.355 --> 12:29.573
Don't make me come down
there and punch him for you.

12:32.742 --> 12:35.163
I can't believe you're a
lawyer who also loves hockey.

12:35.578 --> 12:36.854
That's amazing.

12:36.855 --> 12:38.249
I know. I can't believe it either.

12:38.816 --> 12:40.294
(Chuckles) Next thing
you're gonna tell me is that

12:40.295 --> 12:41.525
you're a... 

12:42.082 --> 12:44.029
Junkyard bunnies fan.

12:45.205 --> 12:46.636
Oh, my God!

12:46.637 --> 12:47.963
I am.

12:47.964 --> 12:49.105
No way!

12:51.876 --> 12:52.993
Excuse me.

12:52.994 --> 12:54.715
I'm performing later, so... 

12:54.716 --> 12:56.139
(Chuckles) Excuse me.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.319
Hey, Ben.

12:57.647 --> 12:58.876
What are you doing?

12:58.877 --> 13:00.710
And again, why are you wearing that?

13:00.711 --> 13:03.411
Oh, well, it would be a
shame if both of us missed out

13:03.412 --> 13:05.593
on this amazing opportunity, so... 

13:05.594 --> 13:06.965
Sorry. Excuse me.

13:07.385 --> 13:08.705
Sorry. Excuse me.

13:08.706 --> 13:10.082
Oh, pardon me. Oh, there we go.

13:10.083 --> 13:11.314
Okay, sorry.

13:11.315 --> 13:12.662
(Groans) Yeah, you're welcome.

13:13.644 --> 13:14.859
Tucker?!

13:14.860 --> 13:16.254
Mrs. Wheeler.

13:16.255 --> 13:18.029
I thought you were going out with Vanessa.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.146
And I thought you said
you were babysitting.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.654
Yeah, she did. Where is my baby?

13:22.655 --> 13:24.463
And do not tell me she's in that pouch.

13:24.464 --> 13:25.981
No, that's just my purse and a hot dog.

13:25.982 --> 13:27.229
I got a sitter.

13:29.524 --> 13:31.352
Well, may the best Ranger-Roo win.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.245
Oh, don't worry, she will.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.528
Ohh-h, okay.

13:34.529 --> 13:35.846
- Oh, yeah
- (Buzzer sounds)

13:35.847 --> 13:37.512
Yes! First period's over.

13:37.965 --> 13:39.315
And while I'm deeply enthralled

13:39.316 --> 13:41.644
in this episode of "when kangaRoos attack,"

13:41.645 --> 13:43.984
I've got more important
things to attend to.

13:43.985 --> 13:46.666
Namely me... And Riley.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.296
(Coughs)

13:49.976 --> 13:51.066
Wait, where'd they go?

13:57.249 --> 13:58.572
(Chuckling nervously) Hey!

13:58.879 --> 14:00.281
Where are you two off to?

14:00.636 --> 14:02.929
In case you missed it, that
was the first period buzzer.

14:03.283 --> 14:04.159
Oh, yeah.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.429
It's getting a little loud in there, and I

14:05.430 --> 14:07.017
keep getting hit in the
head with kangaRoo tails.

14:07.673 --> 14:08.839
So Kevin suggested

14:08.840 --> 14:10.778
we go back to his place and
watch the rest of the game.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.222
(High-pitched) Oh, is
that what Kevin suggested?

14:13.223 --> 14:14.422
(Chuckles)

14:14.423 --> 14:16.339
Can I borrow him for just a second?

14:16.340 --> 14:18.483
Legal stuff. Guy legal stuff.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.828
What is the matter with you?

14:22.829 --> 14:24.494
This plan cannot be any simpler.

14:24.495 --> 14:26.286
I pay you 20 bucks... You act like a jerk.

14:26.753 --> 14:27.895
Now get to it.

14:28.238 --> 14:30.078
Well, there's a little change of plan,

14:30.079 --> 14:31.848
'cause I think she's totally into me.

14:32.312 --> 14:33.723
Because I told you what to say.

14:35.021 --> 14:37.116
I know. Thanks for that, man.

14:37.117 --> 14:38.339
She's pretty amazing.

14:38.340 --> 14:39.859
Duh! Which is why I'm trying to date her.

14:40.438 --> 14:42.395
Ooh. Too late.

14:42.396 --> 14:44.101
I think she's already seeing someone.

14:47.058 --> 14:49.239
You are not gonna get away with this.

14:49.240 --> 14:50.384
Sure I am.

14:50.992 --> 14:53.620
Unless you want me to tell her
the whole thing was a setup.

14:56.177 --> 14:57.469
Yeah.

14:57.816 --> 14:58.941
Didn't think so.

15:01.216 --> 15:03.203
Worst 20 bucks I ever spent.

15:06.912 --> 15:08.767
Dude, what is the matter with you?!

15:08.768 --> 15:10.673
You let Riley go home
with a total stRanger.

15:10.674 --> 15:11.780
You've gotta do something.

15:11.781 --> 15:13.277
<i>Not a total stRanger.</i>

15:13.278 --> 15:15.344
- Then call him!
- I don't have his number.

15:15.345 --> 15:16.583
Well, go to his house.

15:16.584 --> 15:18.185
I'm not exactly sure where he lives.

15:18.556 --> 15:20.368
Well, track him down! What's his last name?

15:21.392 --> 15:23.131
Oh, my God. He's a total stRanger.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.136
- Ben!
- (Whistle tweets)

15:27.137 --> 15:28.656
- (Crowd clamoring)
- What?! Are you kidding?

15:29.708 --> 15:30.444
Wow!

15:30.755 --> 15:32.033
I've never seen anyone get a penalty

15:32.034 --> 15:33.692
when they were already in the penalty box.

15:35.071 --> 15:36.312
(Buzzer sounds)

15:36.313 --> 15:37.964
(Crowd cheering)

15:37.965 --> 15:39.528
<i>Announcer: And that's the
end of the second period.</i>

15:39.910 --> 15:42.674
<i>Now fans, please turn your
attention to the jumbotron.</i>

15:46.029 --> 15:47.642
<i>Time for our mascot competition.</i>

15:47.643 --> 15:49.588
<i>So be sure to cheer for your favorite.</i>

15:50.226 --> 15:52.756
I cannot believe that I
showed you my best moves.

15:52.757 --> 15:54.858
Oh, if those were your "best moves,"

15:54.859 --> 15:56.533
then I think you should just go home now.

15:56.534 --> 15:57.950
Oh? Oh, yeah? Guess what?

15:57.951 --> 16:00.284
- You will kanga-rue
the day... - (Scoffs)

16:00.285 --> 16:02.304
- ... that you ever tried to cross me.
- Oh, that was a good one.

16:03.111 --> 16:04.753
- Oh, it was good.
- (Mockingly) Oh, so good!

16:04.754 --> 16:06.819
Oh, my God! This is it! We're missing it!

16:13.326 --> 16:15.739
(Crowd cheers)

16:16.922 --> 16:18.119
Hands off my Joey!

16:18.505 --> 16:20.346
(Gasps)

16:20.347 --> 16:22.252
Oh, no, you didn't!

16:22.253 --> 16:23.344
Come on!

16:23.345 --> 16:24.112
(Grunting)

16:25.841 --> 16:26.787
Ow!

16:27.124 --> 16:28.451
Oh, hell nah!

16:29.263 --> 16:31.313
<i>(Crowd cheering)</i>

16:31.933 --> 16:33.727
This happens every time!

16:34.916 --> 16:37.137
Wait, Danny. I know what to do.

16:37.138 --> 16:38.158
I'll make this right.

16:38.159 --> 16:39.460
Stay here. I'll be right back.

16:39.990 --> 16:41.546
Where would I go?

16:41.547 --> 16:42.765
I'm at work.

16:52.415 --> 16:53.912
Pretty nice, huh?

16:54.864 --> 16:57.021
Not exactly what I pictured

16:57.022 --> 16:58.822
for a senior partner at a law firm.

16:59.392 --> 17:01.395
How many people do you
share this place with?

17:01.396 --> 17:03.340
Just two. And a band.

17:05.289 --> 17:06.750
Oh, I see what you're saying.

17:07.705 --> 17:10.628
We should probably get things
moving before they get home.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.733
Actually, um, do you think we could
turn the game on before it gets too late?

17:15.734 --> 17:17.080
I promised Danny that I'd watch.

17:17.781 --> 17:19.387
- No problem.
- Thanks.

17:19.387 --> 17:21.948
And, uh, I have two really good
friends in the mascot competition

17:21.949 --> 17:23.214
at intermission.

17:23.214 --> 17:24.588
<i>Announcer: And it's a fluffy scuffle</i>

17:24.589 --> 17:25.765

17:26.078 --> 17:28.358
<i>A fight has gone down amongst
the mascot contestants.</i>

17:29.871 --> 17:30.842
Are those them?

17:31.160 --> 17:32.915
(Scoffs) No. No no no no.

17:32.916 --> 17:33.975
It's definitely not them.

17:36.178 --> 17:38.359
<i>- (Thud on TV)
- Crowd: Ooh!</i>

17:43.337 --> 17:45.509
(Crowd cheering)

18:03.621 --> 18:05.037
"Riley, don't do it.
He's a liar!"

18:05.733 --> 18:06.742
Wait. What is that?

18:06.743 --> 18:07.854
Is that Ben?

18:07.855 --> 18:09.402
- Hey!
- What happened to the picture?

18:09.403 --> 18:10.565
Oh, man!

18:10.566 --> 18:12.139
And my Roommate said
he paid the cable bill.

18:12.926 --> 18:13.789
(Sighs)

18:21.445 --> 18:23.678
"I'm the perfect guy for you!"

18:26.666 --> 18:29.697
Okay, that was definitely
Ben. But if this was his idea

18:29.698 --> 18:31.803
in the first place, why would
he tell me that you're a liar?

18:32.677 --> 18:34.197
Oh, did you think that said "liar"?

18:34.696 --> 18:37.267
I'm pretty sure it said "flier."

18:38.282 --> 18:39.524
'Cause, you know... 

18:42.005 --> 18:43.644
I'm also a pilot.

18:45.310 --> 18:46.611
Wanna make out?

18:48.361 --> 18:51.102
Okay, you know, I should probably go.

18:51.103 --> 18:53.769
Are you sure? I don't have
to be at work until noon.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.640
Wait a minute.

18:58.201 --> 18:59.593
Is this yours?

18:59.594 --> 19:00.911
No.

19:03.289 --> 19:05.322
I thought you said you
worked for a law firm.

19:05.776 --> 19:07.225
I do.

19:08.145 --> 19:10.340
We have a really casual dress code.

19:12.097 --> 19:13.158
Okay.

19:17.170 --> 19:18.360
Hi.

19:18.361 --> 19:19.510
Riley, hi.

19:19.861 --> 19:21.365
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

19:22.592 --> 19:24.010
Saw you on TV tonight.

19:24.630 --> 19:25.514
You did?

19:26.879 --> 19:28.637
It really could not have been more perfect.

19:29.557 --> 19:31.040
It couldn't?

19:31.041 --> 19:32.725
I don't know what I would do without you.

19:33.516 --> 19:35.054
- You don't?
- (Chuckles)

19:35.571 --> 19:37.072
Yeah.

19:37.073 --> 19:38.204
But I think from now on,

19:38.506 --> 19:39.805
I'm gonna pick my own guys.

19:40.790 --> 19:42.355
Wait. Wait, what?

19:42.992 --> 19:46.321
Ben, you set me up with
a pathological liar.

19:47.124 --> 19:49.343
But you do get points for
saving me with that sign.

19:49.711 --> 19:51.060
Yeah.

19:51.061 --> 19:52.656
That sign.

19:53.419 --> 19:55.051
Did you see any other signs?

19:55.052 --> 19:56.874
No, was there something else?

19:58.675 --> 19:59.843
Nothing important.

20:02.693 --> 20:04.115
Well... (Sighs)

20:04.116 --> 20:05.724
I guess the search for the perfect guy

20:05.725 --> 20:07.569
is... still on.

20:08.302 --> 20:09.554
I guess it is.

20:10.115 --> 20:11.646
Yeah.

20:11.647 --> 20:13.044
(Inhales deeply) I guess it is.

20:14.573 --> 20:16.112
<i>(Cellphone buzzes)</i>

20:16.579 --> 20:17.746
One second.

20:17.747 --> 20:19.013
Oh, it's my mom.

20:19.422 --> 20:21.189
I have to go bail her out of hockey jail.

20:21.190 --> 20:22.457
(Laughs)

20:23.485 --> 20:25.236
Hey, but just know... 

20:25.237 --> 20:26.730
You deserve someone great.

20:27.749 --> 20:29.019
(Quietly) Thanks.

20:32.079 --> 20:34.589
And maybe one day you'll
realize that it's you.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.890
We are the Rangers.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.794
(Chanting) The Ranger-Roos.

20:42.795 --> 20:44.329
We're here to get you... 

20:44.330 --> 20:45.577
Into the gRoove.

20:45.918 --> 20:47.177
Both: We're here to dance.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.075
We're here to sway.

20:49.076 --> 20:50.690
You got a problem.

20:50.691 --> 20:51.960
Get out our way.

20:52.325 --> 20:53.731
Hop into the Roo, yo.

20:56.418 --> 20:57.986
What the hell is going on?

20:59.004 --> 21:00.540
I thought the competition was over.

21:00.863 --> 21:04.640
Well,
gues what's in sub-paragraph section D?

21:04.641 --> 21:07.275
- They accept groups.
- Aah!

21:08.387 --> 21:12.650
And we still have
364 days left until next year.

21:13.543 --> 21:14.712
I hope I get traded.
