(birds chirping)

00:44.000 --> 00:46.233
(soft music playing)

00:54.133 --> 00:56.133
-Hi, Ma.
-How'd the interview go?

00:56.200 --> 00:59.533
Terrific.
I have my choice of summer jobs.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.533
Three interviews this week,
three offers.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.967
That's because you're showing more leg,
like I told you.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.066
I don't think the woman
at the employment agency

01:09.133 --> 01:10.467
cared about my legs.

01:10.533 --> 01:12.633
Grow up. Don't you watch TV?

01:12.700 --> 01:15.633
80% of the women on Prime Time
are switch hitters.

01:17.934 --> 01:21.533
Ma, TV soap operas,
heh, aren't real life.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.200
I'm not talking characters.
I'm talking actresses.

01:24.266 --> 01:27.233
Pick up an enquirer sometime.
You'll learn something.

01:28.266 --> 01:32.066
Heh, I'm exhausted.
I've spent all day bed shopping.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.700
Have you no shame?

01:33.767 --> 01:36.066
Bed hopping nowadays
is sexually irresponsible!

01:36.133 --> 01:39.467
Not bed hopping, Ma.
Bed shopping.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.500
(chuckles)

01:42.967 --> 01:45.066
Yeah, right. Nice cover.

01:47.467 --> 01:51.633
It's true, Sophia. I need a new bed.
My oven is falling apart.

02:00.734 --> 02:02.667
The prices are outrageous.

02:02.734 --> 02:07.200
The bed I wanted cost more than
the down payment on my first house.

02:07.266 --> 02:12.233
In Sicily, beds were dirt cheap.
That's because you slept on dirt.

02:14.266 --> 02:18.600
Just an observation. If I were Mark Twain,
you'd be writing this down.

02:19.867 --> 02:24.100
Girls, you won't believe
what happened to me this afternoon!

02:24.166 --> 02:26.433
I met Mr. Terrific!

02:26.500 --> 02:28.367
Rose, don't be so quick to judge.

02:28.433 --> 02:30.767
I once thought I'd met Mr. Terrific.

02:30.834 --> 02:34.367
Turned out there was also a Mrs. Terrific.

02:34.433 --> 02:37.467
I found myself ducking a Mr. Vase.

02:37.867 --> 02:42.400
You don't understand.
I really met Mr. Terrific at the mall,

02:42.467 --> 02:47.166
he was signing autographs in a storefront
that was once Jack Kemp's headquarters.

02:48.633 --> 02:49.734
Look.

02:51.867 --> 02:54.767
-Rose, he's wearing a cape.
-And a mask.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.900
He's wearing a cape and a mask!
(laughs)

02:56.967 --> 03:01.967
Wait a minute. Is he an insurance salesman
named Marshall Herskovitz?

03:02.367 --> 03:04.667
That's his costume!

03:04.734 --> 03:07.767
Don't tell me you've never heard
of Mr. Terrific.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.967
Mr. Terrific's clubhouse?

03:11.033 --> 03:13.834
Every weekday afternoon,
one full hour on Saturdays?

03:13.900 --> 03:15.734
Not that clown show?

03:15.800 --> 03:19.400
No, he's not a clown,
he's a superhero.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.400
You're thinking of Bozo.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.800
I'm talking to Bozo.

03:25.934 --> 03:27.600
Wait a minute. What's this here?

03:27.667 --> 03:32.333
"To the fairest Rose I've seen
until tonight, Mr. Terrific"?

03:33.400 --> 03:35.600
He asked me out.
We're going to dinner.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.000
-Can you believe it?
-(both laughing)

03:37.066 --> 03:41.633
No. You spent 30 seconds
getting an autograph.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.967
You don't even know him!

03:43.033 --> 03:46.233
Dorothy, he's a television celebrity!

03:46.300 --> 03:49.000
Besides, I talked to him for over an hour.

03:49.066 --> 03:51.233
There weren't too many people
who wanted his autograph.

03:51.300 --> 03:56.867
A Mr. Whipple look-alike was next door
demonstrating a 3-ply toilet tissue.

03:57.667 --> 04:01.066
I'd better get ready.
He's picking me up at 7:00.

04:01.467 --> 04:05.000
Can you imagine dating a guy
in a mask and cape

04:05.066 --> 04:08.767
that you met in a shopping mall?
Pretty strange.

04:08.834 --> 04:12.467
Yeah. She doesn't even know
what make car he drives.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.500
(upbeat music playing)

04:22.734 --> 04:23.600
(door opens)

04:24.600 --> 04:27.166
Oh, Sophia.
Did they deliver my new bed?

04:27.233 --> 04:29.367
They were here all day setting it up.

04:29.433 --> 04:31.467
(laughs)
For that simple bed?

04:31.533 --> 04:34.333
Simple? I haven't seen so much brass

04:34.400 --> 04:38.233
since the brass knuckle
and RV show at the Palermo Hilton.

04:38.967 --> 04:41.767
They delivered the wrong bed!

04:41.834 --> 04:44.166
-Blanche, do you think--
-Not now!

04:44.233 --> 04:45.266
What's her hurry?

04:45.333 --> 04:47.367
That enormous thing in her bedroom.

04:47.433 --> 04:49.934
I thought she'd stopped seeing Roger.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.533
How do I look?

04:55.600 --> 04:59.367
Not bad. You got another date
with Captain Marvelous?

04:59.433 --> 05:04.367
Mr. Terrific. You didn't read
many comic books when you were little.

05:04.433 --> 05:08.367
We had comics in Sicily.
There was Benito the Hood.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.433
He lived in the forest
with his merry thugs.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.667
Benito was very popular.

05:13.734 --> 05:16.100
Because he stole from the rich
and gave to the poor?

05:16.166 --> 05:19.100
Benito the Hood,
not Benito the idiot.

05:20.467 --> 05:23.400
He stole from everyone
and kept it for himself.

05:24.667 --> 05:28.600
Didn't even share it with his band
of merry thugs.

05:28.667 --> 05:32.066
He was the idol of many
a Sicilian youngster.

05:32.133 --> 05:35.934
That's what they did.
They delivered the wrong bed.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.200
You don't like this one?

05:37.266 --> 05:42.066
It's the most stunning thing
I've ever seen, but I can't afford it.

05:42.133 --> 05:48.333
That bed back there must cost...
exactly the same as the one I ordered.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.033
They made a mistake!

05:50.100 --> 05:52.500
They charged me for the inexpensive bed!

05:52.567 --> 05:55.533
Merry Christmas from Neiman Marcus.

05:56.567 --> 05:59.834
Sophia, she can't keep that bed.
That'd be like stealing.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.400
It's only stealing if they find out.

06:03.767 --> 06:06.033
The bed's in my bedroom.
Who's going to know?

06:06.100 --> 06:10.433
Everyone who knows the bunt sign
on the New York Yankees.

06:12.233 --> 06:13.233
(doorbell rings)

06:18.834 --> 06:20.900
Look, everyone. Mr. Terrific.

06:20.967 --> 06:23.700
Rose, please, you're embarrassing me.

06:23.767 --> 06:29.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I just get such a kick
out of your slogan.

06:29.066 --> 06:31.867
That's his slogan?
"Look, everyone. Mr. Terrific"?

06:31.934 --> 06:35.000
22 years, next fall.

06:35.066 --> 06:37.200
You must be Sophia.

06:37.266 --> 06:40.433
And I'm Blanche Devereaux.
Nice meeting you.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.200
Oh, you watch the show?

06:42.266 --> 06:45.834
Why? (laughs)
I already know how to brush my teeth.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.467
Good for you.

06:47.533 --> 06:51.333
Then you won't be rounded up
by the cavity cops.

06:52.100 --> 06:56.333
Oh, Dorothy, I'm glad you're here.
Meet Mr. Terrific.

06:56.400 --> 07:00.667
Oh, Mr. Terrific,
meet Mrs. Severely Depressed.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.633
Dorothy, what's wrong?

07:02.700 --> 07:08.500
I just found out what my day camp job
is head of arts and crafts.

07:08.567 --> 07:13.233
I'll be spending the entire summer
gluing macaroni to construction paper.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.767
Dorothy's a high school teacher
looking for summertime work.

07:16.834 --> 07:20.000
Really? I might be able to help you out.

07:20.066 --> 07:23.800
My producer's looking for someone
with education credentials

07:23.867 --> 07:26.633
to act as a consultant on the show.

07:26.700 --> 07:30.934
-That could be very interesting.
-Oh, I doubt it.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.100
The only really interesting job
on the show is being me.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.367
But I'll be glad to see what I can do.
Come on, Rose. We better get going.

07:40.433 --> 07:43.533
If you can do anything,
it would be really...

07:43.600 --> 07:44.433
Terrific?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.233
Nice meeting you.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.834
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye and thank you.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.767
Don't count on that job, Dorothy.

07:54.834 --> 07:59.367
Many women have had their hopes dashed
by smooth TV sharpies.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.967
Dave Garroway told me
if I treated him right,

08:02.033 --> 08:04.200
I'd be his sidekick on the today show.

08:04.266 --> 08:08.100
I said no,
and he ended up with a monkey.

08:09.066 --> 08:12.000
Uh, draw your own conclusions.

08:16.333 --> 08:18.767
<i>♪ T-E-R-R-I-F-I-C ♪</i>

08:18.834 --> 08:22.433
<i>♪ Shove a mister in the front</i>
<i>And you've got me ♪</i>

08:24.100 --> 08:29.667
Okay, boys and girls,
it's time to learn about our special word.

08:29.734 --> 08:31.300
Kolak.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.600
Tell us what today's special word is.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.367
(speaks foreign dialect)

08:37.433 --> 08:40.266
The word for today is hot.

08:40.333 --> 08:45.500
Hot has a lot of meanings, boys and girls.

08:46.266 --> 08:48.567
Coffee is hot.

08:49.033 --> 08:51.433
A stove is hot.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.900
Angie Dickinson is hot.

08:55.967 --> 08:58.533
Very funny, Mr. Stage Manager.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.433
And now, boys and girls,
we're going to see--

09:01.500 --> 09:04.133
(crashing)

09:04.200 --> 09:06.333
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.767
My super terrific hearing
detects a visitor.

09:14.266 --> 09:20.533
It's Mr. Policeman
disguised as Mr. Mailman.

09:21.367 --> 09:25.033
Why? Why?
Why don't I find out why

09:25.100 --> 09:27.867
while you boys and girls
watch another very special

09:27.934 --> 09:30.900
adventure of Ricky the Flying Turtle.

09:30.967 --> 09:33.166
See you in a few minutes.

09:33.233 --> 09:34.166
Clear.

09:35.133 --> 09:39.467
Freddie, it's been 16 years.
When are you going to learn?

09:39.533 --> 09:44.600
Tuesday, it's Mr. Policeman.
Thursday, it's Mr. Mailman.

09:47.633 --> 09:50.200
And wonders why he can't
have his own series.

09:50.266 --> 09:51.533
(speaks foreign dialect)

09:52.033 --> 09:55.166
Dorothy, I read your memo.
I like the way you think.

09:55.233 --> 09:58.000
Well, thank you, Mr. Hastings.
Thank you very much.

09:58.066 --> 10:00.300
You've got a lot of modern ideas
for a woman your age.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.433
Oh, you're just saying that.
(laughs)

10:02.500 --> 10:04.533
No, no, I mean it.
I really think you're old.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.133
(laughs)

10:09.200 --> 10:10.834
Dorothy, how's the show going?

10:10.900 --> 10:13.867
Terrible. But better than <i>Thirtysomething</i>.

10:14.967 --> 10:18.533
We're back in five,
four, three, two...

10:19.266 --> 10:22.367
Wasn't that fun, boys and girls?

10:22.433 --> 10:25.467
(speaking foreign dialect)

10:25.533 --> 10:31.333
Kolak says that I have to return
to my home planet of Twylar immediately.

10:31.400 --> 10:37.433
So we'll just say goodbye this time
until next time, boys and girls,

10:37.500 --> 10:41.233
when you turn on your TV sets
and hear...

10:41.300 --> 10:44.700
(crowd)
Look, everyone, Mr. Terrific!

10:44.767 --> 10:46.600
(fanfare playing)

10:46.667 --> 10:47.633
(man 1) Clear!

10:48.834 --> 10:50.767
(Mr. Terrific sighs)

10:50.834 --> 10:54.333
Hi, Rose. Let me change capes,
and we'll get going.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.500
In my office, Terrific. Now.

10:56.567 --> 11:00.767
Say please, Mr. Producer!
Little twerp.

11:00.834 --> 11:05.467
He was on my show when he was 5.
He sat on my lap and peed on my lap.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.800
I guess old habits die hard.

11:10.734 --> 11:12.900
Listen,
why don't I go back with Dorothy?

11:12.967 --> 11:17.133
-You can stop by afterwards.
-You're a terrific lady, Rose.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.533
Thank you.

11:18.600 --> 11:22.133
How come you're not wearing
the Terrific Lady button?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.867
-Oh, sorry. Yes, right.
-(sighs)

11:26.867 --> 11:29.934
-I'm nuts about that guy.
-You'd have to be.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.600
But, you know, it's so strange.

11:32.667 --> 11:36.734
You have no idea what it's like
dating a superhero.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.467
Sure, I can.

11:38.533 --> 11:41.767
My Stan and Superman
had a lot in common.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.333
They were both faster than
a speeding bullet.

11:48.033 --> 11:50.200
(upbeat music playing)

11:50.266 --> 11:52.333
(birds chirping)

11:52.400 --> 11:53.633
(door opens)

11:53.700 --> 11:56.300
I haven't had a decent
night's sleep in weeks.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.600
Every time I climb into bed,
I feel guilty.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.900
Take down the video equipment.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.834
I'm talking about the brass bed.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.600
Rose was right.
It's just like stealing.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.700
Then call and return it.

12:10.767 --> 12:14.467
I've had it three weeks.
They won't take it.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.367
How much wear can you give a bed
in just three weeks?

12:19.066 --> 12:20.367
Ah...

12:21.834 --> 12:23.367
I see your point.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.266
Hi.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.800
Don't you have a date
with Mr. Terrific?

12:28.867 --> 12:31.000
Oh, he'll be over soon.

12:31.066 --> 12:33.600
The producer had to meet with him.

12:33.667 --> 12:38.166
I have a feeling it was to discuss
some recommendations I made.

12:38.233 --> 12:41.600
I hope you recommended
he do some exercise.

12:41.667 --> 12:46.300
A man shouldn't be allowed to wear tights
unless he's got a butt like Baryshnikov.

12:49.233 --> 12:50.066
(doorbell rings)

12:50.734 --> 12:52.633
Oh, there he is.

12:52.700 --> 12:56.533
Dorothy, what should I do with my bed?

12:57.066 --> 12:59.967
Put it in the <i>Smithsonian</i>, Blanche.

13:00.033 --> 13:03.633
It has more miles on it
than the spirit of St. Louis.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.967
Seriously, what do you think I should do?

13:06.033 --> 13:09.700
Oh, you know the difference
between right and wrong.

13:09.767 --> 13:14.200
In bed, she only knows the difference
between right and left.

13:18.767 --> 13:21.367
Honey, why are you
still wearing your costume?

13:21.433 --> 13:23.967
I couldn't wait to leave there.

13:24.033 --> 13:25.000
What happened?

13:25.066 --> 13:26.633
They fired me.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.100
And it's all her fault.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.066
(soft music playing)

13:33.233 --> 13:35.700
(birds chirping)

13:35.767 --> 13:37.467
(mellow music playing)

13:37.934 --> 13:40.767
Fired you? How could
they fire Mr. Terrific?

13:40.834 --> 13:42.767
How? I'll tell you how.

13:42.834 --> 13:44.867
The newly hired amateur consultant

13:44.934 --> 13:48.133
had recommendations
on how to improve my show!

13:48.200 --> 13:50.467
They were only suggestions,

13:50.533 --> 13:52.967
some ideas I thought
would help the show.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.300
Oh, like changing the theme song?

13:55.767 --> 13:59.633
Well, frankly, heh,
the lyrics are a bit inane.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.233
I wrote those lyrics.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.533
How did Dorothy get you fired?

14:04.600 --> 14:07.500
They loved her ideas
and they said use them.

14:07.567 --> 14:09.667
I said no.
They said, "you're fired."

14:09.734 --> 14:13.066
I never intended for this to happen.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.567
First thing tomorrow I'll go talk to him.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.867
Sit down, honey. Don't worry.

14:17.934 --> 14:20.867
Dorothy says she'll get your job back,
and she will.

14:20.934 --> 14:23.266
I guess it's worth a shot.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.934
Look, here's where you can reach me.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.066
Call me if you can work things out.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.367
I'll be there until show time.

14:32.433 --> 14:33.367
Wait.

14:33.834 --> 14:36.500
-What?
-Please leave by the back door.

14:43.667 --> 14:46.333
Oh, Mr. Hastings,
I need to speak to you--

14:46.400 --> 14:49.166
Not now, Dorothy.
We've lost our star.

14:49.233 --> 14:50.300
Did you find him?

14:50.367 --> 14:53.934
-I know where Mr. Terrific is.
-Not him. Mr. Mailman.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.967
-He's our guest host. He's disappeared.
-Oh, try the ladies' room.

14:58.033 --> 15:01.500
I found him there once
when he was playing Mrs. Nurse.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.367
-Do we have a nurse character?
-We don't.

15:04.834 --> 15:07.700
Mr. Hastings,
when I made those recommendations,

15:07.767 --> 15:11.400
I never intended for you
to fire Mr. Terrific--

15:11.467 --> 15:13.700
Dorothy, the guy is history.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.433
His day's over. People don't want
those shows anymore.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.400
-The public loves him.
-The numbers say different.

15:19.467 --> 15:22.533
-I found him!
-Great. Two minutes till air time.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.767
No. No one can replace Mr. Terrific.

15:25.834 --> 15:28.033
Say goodbye to Mr. Policeman.

15:28.500 --> 15:32.100
It's Thursday.
Isn't he supposed to be Mr. Mailman?

15:32.500 --> 15:36.700
-Fine, what do we do now?
-Your star's a phone call away.

15:36.767 --> 15:40.166
Give me the word,
and Mr. Terrific's on the air!

15:40.233 --> 15:42.433
Wait. Wait a minute!

15:42.800 --> 15:45.233
I've got a better idea.

15:46.066 --> 15:48.934
(mellow music playing)

15:59.066 --> 16:01.066
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:02.367 --> 16:04.533
I guess your friend
couldn't work things out.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.166
But there's still time.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.000
I think my time has passed.

16:09.066 --> 16:12.433
22 years I've been Mr. Terrific.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.967
22 years!

16:15.033 --> 16:17.800
I was doing weekend weather forecasts

16:17.867 --> 16:23.033
when I turned an old blanket into a cape
and created Mr. Terrific.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.633
Kolak, the puppet?

16:24.700 --> 16:28.700
I made him from a sock
10 minutes before air time.

16:28.767 --> 16:32.900
It was an Argyle.
Back then, Kolak was Scottish.

16:33.533 --> 16:37.066
Everything about that show came
from inside my head.

16:37.133 --> 16:38.467
And off your foot.

16:38.533 --> 16:40.233
(sighs)

16:41.200 --> 16:43.333
Kids started tuning in in droves.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.867
The critics called me
the next Captain Kangaroo!

16:46.934 --> 16:49.800
Mr. Green jeans sent me a fan letter!

16:49.867 --> 16:55.367
I'm not going to let it end like this.
My fans wouldn't want this.

16:55.834 --> 16:59.734
Dorothy won't let you down.
I'll bet she's calling you now.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.967
(gasps)

17:06.500 --> 17:09.133
(Dorothy)
<i>So I'm Mrs. Schoolteacher.</i>

17:09.600 --> 17:12.700
<i>And I'm going to be your friend</i>
<i>just for today.</i>

17:13.166 --> 17:17.066
<i>Of course, Kolak from Twylar</i>
<i>will also be here.</i>

17:21.233 --> 17:22.300
<i>Later.</i>

17:24.266 --> 17:25.633
(Rose) Where you going?

17:25.700 --> 17:29.166
Back to the studio.
There's only one thing left to do!

17:33.133 --> 17:34.233
Who was that nut?

17:34.300 --> 17:37.633
I don't know.
Mr. Terrific usually comes in alone.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.567
(tense music playing)

17:41.633 --> 17:45.934
It's important that
we eat lots of fruits and grains

17:46.000 --> 17:49.633
and try to avoid sweets.
Right, Kolak?

17:49.700 --> 17:52.100
Why don't you avoid sweets?

17:52.166 --> 17:54.300
It's not a pretty picture from down here.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.767
(laughs) Kolak,
I didn't know you could speak English.

17:59.834 --> 18:04.000
What you don't know
could fill a space the size of Guam.

18:04.467 --> 18:05.934
Since you brought up Guam,

18:06.000 --> 18:09.533
why don't we talk about geography
for a little bit?

18:09.600 --> 18:12.867
Want geography, lady?
I'll show you some geography!

18:12.934 --> 18:14.834
Whoa! Kolak!

18:14.900 --> 18:18.767
Want to know what we call this
on the Planet Twylar?

18:18.834 --> 18:22.266
Like that's really going to shut me up!

18:22.333 --> 18:24.133
What do I do now?

18:24.200 --> 18:28.867
Why don't you tell the boys and girls
how you gave Mr. Terrific the ax?

18:28.934 --> 18:32.700
A cartoon. That's right.
Here we go. (laughs)

18:33.100 --> 18:34.500
You're clear!

18:34.567 --> 18:36.133
That's it! I'm finished!

18:36.200 --> 18:38.100
Relax! Things are going well!

18:38.166 --> 18:40.600
Well? They were trying
to kill me out there!

18:40.667 --> 18:44.033
They want Mr. Terrific back.
So do I.

18:44.100 --> 18:47.500
Dorothy, how could you do this?
I thought you were my friend.

18:47.567 --> 18:50.567
I am, Rose. It happened so fast.

18:50.633 --> 18:55.567
They pushed me out there, and
suddenly I was singing the theme song.

18:55.633 --> 18:59.100
I'm sorry. I didn't intend this to happen.

18:59.166 --> 19:02.967
You tell this to Mr. Terrific.
He thinks you stole his job.

19:03.033 --> 19:05.133
The minute I see him.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.500
He's right here, where'd he go?

19:07.967 --> 19:11.266
Mr. Terrific's on the ledge!
Looks like he's about to jump!

19:11.867 --> 19:14.433
-Oh.
-Hey, where's everybody going?

19:14.500 --> 19:16.333
We've got a show to do!

19:16.734 --> 19:18.233
You're on!

19:21.166 --> 19:24.934
I'm on in five, four,
three, two...

19:26.033 --> 19:27.800
Hi, kids.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.500
-How you doing, Mr. Terrific?
-Terrific.

19:33.567 --> 19:38.400
-Uh, why don't you come inside?
-I can't fly from inside.

19:38.467 --> 19:41.967
That's how Superman does it.
I fly from the ledge.

19:42.033 --> 19:45.266
That's how we do it on Planet Twylar.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.166
-Any hope?
-I'll be honest.

19:47.233 --> 19:51.600
Right now, Squeaky Fromme
has a better grasp on reality.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.400
(Rose breathing heavily)

19:55.567 --> 20:00.233
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Rose. I can see your house from here.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.834
-Really? Where?
-Rose!

20:04.166 --> 20:07.200
Honey, we want you
to come in off the ledge.

20:07.266 --> 20:10.100
-We're worried about you.
-There's nothing to worry about.

20:10.166 --> 20:13.066
I won't jump. That would be crazy.

20:13.133 --> 20:16.133
Oh, thank goodness!
I'm going to fly.

20:17.533 --> 20:20.467
-You can't fly!
-Mr. Terrific can do anything!

20:20.533 --> 20:24.700
Of course you can, Mr. Terrific.
Don't argue with him.

20:24.767 --> 20:28.800
Mr. Terrific,
Lex Luthor and the Joker

20:28.867 --> 20:31.500
are harassing an old lady
in the stairwell.

20:31.567 --> 20:35.500
Could you come in and melt them
with your X-ray vision?

20:36.300 --> 20:39.667
-Mr. Terrific doesn't have X-ray vision!
-Please, Rose!

20:39.734 --> 20:42.300
This is no time to point out
his shortcomings!

20:43.633 --> 20:48.667
Mr. Terrific, please come inside!
We'll figure a way to get your job back.

20:48.734 --> 20:54.600
To get my job back, I have to prove
to my fans I deserve my name.

20:55.066 --> 20:57.300
Hello, fans!

20:57.367 --> 21:00.100
It's me, Mr. Terrific!

21:00.166 --> 21:03.333
(crowd)
Jump, jump, jump, jump...

21:05.266 --> 21:09.133
-There's only one thing to do!
-Rose! Rose, no!

21:09.200 --> 21:12.567
Rose! Rose, don't go out...
Rose, come back here!

21:12.633 --> 21:16.900
Don't worry. I was trained in psychology
back in St. Olaf.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.266
That doesn't count, Rose.

21:19.333 --> 21:23.000
In St. Olaf, they think Freud's
a way to cook chicken.

21:26.734 --> 21:29.934
-Honey, do you still think you can fly?
-Yes.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.100
If you're going to fly,
I'm going with you.

21:34.166 --> 21:36.967
-Still want to do it?
-Absolutely.

21:39.533 --> 21:41.767
I should have paid closer attention

21:41.834 --> 21:44.600
during that refresher course
at the junior college.

21:48.066 --> 21:52.900
Oh, my God! He's flying!

21:57.200 --> 21:59.233
(soft music playing)

22:11.367 --> 22:14.533
Wait a minute. Wasn't it dangerous
flying around that building?

22:14.600 --> 22:19.100
No, I was rigged in a double harness,
suspended by steel cables.

22:19.166 --> 22:22.266
-Yeah, but Rose wasn't.
-Oh, I wasn't worried.

22:22.333 --> 22:26.834
I know Mr. Terrific's superhero code.
He'd never drop a girl.

22:28.567 --> 22:30.467
I'm glad the publicity stunt worked.

22:30.533 --> 22:34.066
I couldn't be happier
you got your job back.

22:34.133 --> 22:37.734
(laughs) Freddy will be here soon.
We've got lots to celebrate.

22:37.800 --> 22:42.300
Yes. I'm still Mr. Terrific,
and he's still Mr. Policeman.

22:42.767 --> 22:45.033
I cannot sleep anymore!

22:45.100 --> 22:48.300
I just lie there, waiting for the
authorities to catch up with me!

22:48.767 --> 22:51.100
Every siren I hear I know is for me.

22:51.166 --> 22:55.233
Every footstep outside
belongs to that obsessive detective

22:55.300 --> 22:58.100
who will not rest until he tracks me down!

22:58.967 --> 23:01.266
Blanche, you are being ridiculous.

23:01.333 --> 23:03.600
(doorbell rings)

23:05.934 --> 23:07.100
Oh!

23:07.166 --> 23:09.934
Thank God!
I can't live with myself anymore! Take me!

23:10.000 --> 23:10.700
Blanche--

23:10.767 --> 23:13.567
Dorothy stay out of this.
I know what's best.

23:13.633 --> 23:16.667
Slap the handcuffs on me.
The bed's this way.

23:19.533 --> 23:20.934
You know what's funny?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.700
I was supposed
to be Mr. Mailman today.

23:28.033 --> 23:31.867
(soft music playing)

23:33.233 --> 23:36.100
(theme music playing)
