WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:08.742
[theme music]

00:56.056 --> 00:58.426
What's with the
laundry stuff all over?

00:58.526 --> 01:00.461
I got to find my blue
skirt for the picture.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.829
What picture?

01:01.929 --> 01:03.597
Oh, Dad's getting a
photographer to take

01:03.697 --> 01:05.666
some stupid family portrait.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.102
He's doing what?

01:08.202 --> 01:10.037
So you're saying if I
order the 32-piece package,

01:10.138 --> 01:11.239
you'll throw in the wallet size?

01:11.339 --> 01:12.140
Dan?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.841
One sec, babe.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.509
Yeah, I understand the
offer expires this weekend.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.215
I think I better talk
to my wife first.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.116
Right, bye.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.989
Honey, guess what I just did?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.159
It doesn't have anything to
do with a once-in-a-lifetime

01:31.259 --> 01:33.827
money saving offer, does it?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.129
No.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.564
What would you say
to a full-colored

01:36.664 --> 01:38.899
commemorative family portrait?

01:38.999 --> 01:41.669
Of whose family?

01:41.769 --> 01:42.870
Ours.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.272
What do we need that for?

01:44.372 --> 01:45.773
Because this came today.

01:45.873 --> 01:49.042
We got our 15-year high
school reunion coming up.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.711
Oh, spare me.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.046
What happened to
your school spirit?

01:53.147 --> 01:55.816
I lost it on prom night
along with everything else.

01:59.387 --> 02:02.890
Oh, great cream style.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.392
No, check this out.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.394
The reunion committee
is updating the yearbook

02:06.494 --> 02:08.596
and they want us to send
them a family portrait.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.732
Why, to see if we've
improved with age?

02:11.832 --> 02:13.667
Rosanne, people are going
to be looking at this yearbook

02:13.767 --> 02:15.269
for years to come.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.938
I think we should send in the
best picture we possibly can.

02:18.038 --> 02:21.742
We should send them in that
one of us in Yellowstone Park.

02:21.842 --> 02:26.314
Rosie, we're mooning
Old Faithful in that one.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.582
I know, but it fits
in with the theme here,

02:28.682 --> 02:32.620
looking back on 15 years.

02:32.720 --> 02:36.590
Whose lame-brain idea
is this, anyways?

02:36.690 --> 02:38.559
Oh my god, it's Phyllis Zimmer.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.295
That pointy-head little phony.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.231
Now, wasn't she the one
that was always in charge

02:43.331 --> 02:44.598
of everything in high school?

02:44.698 --> 02:48.101
Yes, she was in charge
of making me sick.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.771
Remember her pep?

02:50.871 --> 02:52.740
Come on, everybody,
grab some crepe paper.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.242
We're going to go in
the gym and decorate it,

02:54.342 --> 02:55.243
and then we'll make punch.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.747
I like it.

02:59.847 --> 03:03.050
Do it again, only jump up and
down and shake your pompoms.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.952
Get away from me.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.821
You know why she wants
us to send in a picture?

03:07.921 --> 03:10.190
To make sure that her
life turned out the best.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.932
Mom, DJ's bothering me.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.834
I'm a cowboy.

03:20.934 --> 03:25.105
No, you're not any
kind of a cowboy.

03:25.205 --> 03:33.146
(SINGING) Whoopi-Ki-Yay,
get along little doggie.

03:33.247 --> 03:37.585
You know Wyoming will
be your new home.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.723
Mom, I can't do my homework.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.860
You can't do your homework
because the TV is on.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.928
Give me that rope, partner.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.697
I need that for your daddy.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.698
Can I tie you up?

03:50.798 --> 03:51.665
Yeah.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.733
Hey, I don't
mean to push, but I

03:52.833 --> 03:54.535
got to call Flash
Photo back and let them

03:54.635 --> 03:56.036
know what the deal is here.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.905
Well, your tail is really
wagging over this picture,

03:58.005 --> 03:58.806
isn't it?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.007
[dog bark]

04:00.107 --> 04:01.675
Picture, what picture?

04:01.775 --> 04:02.876
Are we getting
our picture taken?

04:02.976 --> 04:04.278
We're thinking about it.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.280
Well, you guys aren't going to
do what you did in Yellowstone,

04:06.380 --> 04:09.249
are you?

04:09.350 --> 04:10.584
We're thinking about it.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.360
Where's your lunch?

04:19.460 --> 04:20.728
I ate it.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.430
Just one.

04:22.530 --> 04:25.799
Hey Roseanne, I hear Dan
kept you up half the night

04:25.899 --> 04:26.867
last night.

04:26.967 --> 04:27.968
Ooh!

04:28.068 --> 04:32.606
It's not as good as
it sounds, porno-head.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.508
He was up all night
looking for a belt that

04:34.608 --> 04:36.209
matches his tie and his shirt.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.012
He's going to wear himself
out over this picture.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.180
Yes, and I have
to, like, give up

04:40.280 --> 04:42.049
a whole Saturday to
impress some people

04:42.149 --> 04:44.284
I didn't even like back then.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.554
I sure cared what my
schoolmates thought.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.857
We know, Crystal.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.694
They voted me second runner-up
for Junior Sweetheart Queen.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.830
I would've won, except
for Tristy Vane.

04:56.930 --> 05:01.068
She got her hair done,
which was against the rules.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.235
I know the type.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.472
Perfect hair, perfect teeth--

05:04.572 --> 05:07.741
Matching sweater and headband.

05:07.841 --> 05:08.976
I think that's a smart look.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.815
Well, that's why you
came in second, Crystal.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.352
I always hated those
frilly dilly types.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.855
Yeah, and we had a girl like
that in our school, huh, sis?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.392
I don't even like
remembering it.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.360
Her locker was next
to mine this one day,

05:26.460 --> 05:28.429
and I didn't know
my rifle was loaded.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.536
It blew her right in half.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.805
She didn't know.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.508
It took me almost all of
5th period to get over it.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.712
There's no paper towels.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.547
You know, this is the
third time this week.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.116
How come there's always
paper towels in the men's room?

05:49.216 --> 05:50.317
They never dry their hands.

05:50.418 --> 05:54.221
Yeah, 'cause they
never wash their hands.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.056
I don't know why
management can't

05:56.156 --> 05:59.192
get us the supplies we need.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.429
This has got nothing
to do with paper towels.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.096
This is just a sneaky
old ploy by management

06:03.196 --> 06:05.899
to get us all worked up in
a huff about small stuff

06:05.999 --> 06:07.868
so we never think about things
that are really important,

06:07.968 --> 06:12.506
like benefits and pay raises
and fresher vending items.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.576
Those slimeballs are
trying to break us.

06:15.676 --> 06:16.777
You're right.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.946
God, I get so sick of
how you guys get so worked

06:19.046 --> 06:20.614
up over every little thing.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.551
JACKIE: (SARCASTICALLY) Always
about every little thing!

06:25.986 --> 06:26.987
PETE (IN RESTROOM):
Hi, Roseanne!

06:31.525 --> 06:34.294
What did I tell you
about going in there?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.195
She likes it in there.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.366
She wants to be a man.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.234
That makes two
of us, huh, Pete?

06:46.540 --> 06:49.109
Hey, ladies, not only do they
have all the paper towels,

06:49.209 --> 06:50.978
but they got great, big old
drinking fountains in there,

06:51.078 --> 06:51.879
too.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.384
You know what the
problem with you women is?

06:57.485 --> 06:58.986
You use too damn
many paper products.

06:59.086 --> 07:03.624
Oh, shut up, or I'll wipe
my hands on your bald head.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.325
Tell you what, I'll make
sure that you ladies get

07:05.425 --> 07:06.927
some paper towels, all right?

07:07.027 --> 07:11.131
Hey, Booker, we want 'em now,
or we don't go back to work.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.065
Strike!
LADIES: Strike!

07:12.165 --> 07:12.966
Strike!

07:13.066 --> 07:13.867
Strike!

07:16.369 --> 07:17.304
Pete, get some towels.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.326
Hey, dad!

07:39.426 --> 07:40.427
Look, you know
what would be cool?

07:40.528 --> 07:41.461
We can put this in the picture.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.163
No, that would
be too much, honey.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.532
Oh, come on, Dad,
it would be so cool.

07:44.632 --> 07:47.267
Look, we can put it right here.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.703
Yeah, it does add
a certain something.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.104
I hate my hair.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.239
I hate my clothes.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.674
I hate my face.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.775
Oh, well, that
makes two of us.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.047
Honey, I already told
you, you look fine.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.148
I can't get my hair right.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.584
Shave it and shut up.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.452
I hate this sweater.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.487
Hey, Dad, you know
what would be cool?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.356
We can all wear our
sunglasses and hang

08:09.456 --> 08:12.259
out the back of the truck.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.261
Ixnay on the shades, princess.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.496
Let's just try and look
like a normal family.

08:16.597 --> 08:20.968
Well, why can't
we be ourselves?

08:21.068 --> 08:22.870
How do I look, Dad?

08:22.970 --> 08:25.539
Top drawer, amigo.

08:25.639 --> 08:29.442
Daddy's little man, ha, ha, ha.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.044
- What about this?
- Fine, perfect.

08:31.144 --> 08:31.945
OK, come on.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.146
DJ, you stay in here.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.748
Becky, you're here.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.783
Darlene, you're over here.

08:35.883 --> 08:39.887
Darlene, hey, up,
ha, ha, ha, ha, hya!

08:39.987 --> 08:41.454
OK, you're over here.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.724
Mom's here.

08:43.824 --> 08:44.692
OK, I'm here.

08:44.792 --> 08:45.826
Darlene, you're
blocking the trophy.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.899
Hey, this ain't too shabby.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.466
We look pretty good.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.969
Rosie, come here
and check this out.

08:56.069 --> 08:56.870
KIDS: Whoa!

08:56.970 --> 08:59.873
BECKY: Look at Mom!

08:59.973 --> 09:01.909
Ooh la la, look at you.

09:02.009 --> 09:02.810
Stunning, ain't it?

09:02.910 --> 09:06.146
I brushed my teeth.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.648
What happened to you?

09:07.748 --> 09:10.050
This is the real me.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.619
That's my favorite dress.

09:11.719 --> 09:15.823
You can wear it
tonight when we're alone.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.524
Help me with this
necklace, honey.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.926
All right.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.861
ROSEANNE: Don't choke me, now.

09:20.961 --> 09:21.795
Hi.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.163
ROSEANNE: Hi.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.666
Am I in the wrong house?

09:25.766 --> 09:26.667
You bet!

09:26.767 --> 09:29.637
You want the one
right down the street.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.471
You guys look great.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.773
What are you doing here?

09:32.873 --> 09:33.674
Laundry.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.042
It's Saturday.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.977
Besides, I got to make sure
this hack photographer you hired

09:37.077 --> 09:38.445
doesn't screw the picture up.

09:38.545 --> 09:43.884
Oh, Aunt Jackie, I have
to show you something.

09:43.984 --> 09:47.054
Hey, you look pretty
handsome there, sport.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.756
I know.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.323
You know, this
is the first time

09:50.423 --> 09:52.059
we've had a real
photographer take our picture

09:52.159 --> 09:53.526
since our wedding day?

09:53.627 --> 09:56.797
Yeah, Black Sunday?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.265
Who are you kidding?

09:58.365 --> 09:59.432
You loved it.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.434
You practically
ran down the aisle.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.937
Yeah, but I was just drunk
and I meant to go the other way.

10:06.940 --> 10:07.741
[laughter]

10:07.841 --> 10:08.709
JACKIE: Come here!

10:08.809 --> 10:09.643
Come here!

10:09.743 --> 10:11.078
Look at your dad.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.512
What do you got here?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.247
- Your senior yearbook.
- Your football picture.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.148
Ah!

10:15.248 --> 10:17.584
Old 67.

10:17.685 --> 10:18.518
Hey, wait a minute.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.287
Well, what's wrong
with your nose?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.289
Oh, he always
flared his nostrils

10:22.389 --> 10:25.325
out like that because he
thought it made him look mean.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.461
No, it's because the way
the other guys smelled.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.297
Oh, there's you, Mom.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.631
You look so queer.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.201
I can't believe
you wore a flip.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.704
That's when I was going
through my Marlo Thomas's "That

10:36.804 --> 10:40.874
Girl" phase, and I was
going to go to New York

10:40.974 --> 10:43.811
and become a writer/spokesmodel.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.079
You gave it all up for
a guy with flared nostrils

10:46.179 --> 10:48.248
and stinky friends.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.450
I think you look pretty.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.420
Well, I think you
look purdy, too.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.422
Dad, when did you
fall in love with Mom?

10:55.522 --> 10:58.892
As soon as she
told me to, honey.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.393
You couldn't pry them apart.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.862
It was disgusting.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.163
Well, what about you, Mom?

11:03.263 --> 11:05.398
Were you always
in love with Dad?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.200
He was all man and all mine.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.737
Ooh baby, baby.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.672
It was shameless the
way your mother chased me.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.508
Everyday she'd be there at my
locker, panting and clawing.

11:15.608 --> 11:16.944
Yeah, back in
the good old days

11:17.044 --> 11:20.613
when I still had a
waistline and some estrogen.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.816
I can't believe how
young we are here.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.118
We're only five years
older than Becky.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.220
Well, don't give
her any ideas.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.356
It wasn't all a picnic.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.158
What about that week
you broke up with me?

11:31.258 --> 11:32.425
I didn't break up with you.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.526
Yeah, you did.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.995
That week senior year.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.229
DAN: You broke up with me.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.397
ROSEANNE: I did not.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.032
I was just trying to
keep you on your toes

11:39.132 --> 11:40.633
and shake you up a bit.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.202
We were at Arnie
Patterson's garage dance,

11:42.302 --> 11:43.403
and we had that big fight.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.838
And you said you were
going to see other people.

11:44.938 --> 11:45.873
He's right, Roseanne.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.140
I remember, because
you had just read

11:47.240 --> 11:49.142
that article about how to
drive your boyfriend wild

11:49.242 --> 11:50.778
by making him jealous.

11:50.878 --> 11:55.082
Well, don't tell him about it!

11:55.182 --> 11:57.217
That's why you don't
have a man, because you

11:57.317 --> 12:00.520
don't know what to leave out.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.056
Oh, so you leave out the
part where you come crawling

12:03.156 --> 12:04.557
back on your hands and knees.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.827
You know, you really need to
start bleaching your mustache.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.295
It's coming in a lot darker.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.232
[doorbell]

12:12.332 --> 12:13.733
Oh, that's the photographer.

12:13.834 --> 12:14.935
DAN: I'll get it.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.237
I'll get the door!

12:17.337 --> 12:20.240
Oh, look, Lee Egblad.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.742
Oh, Eggy, that psychopath.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.945
I wonder what he's doing now.

12:25.045 --> 12:25.946
Probably 20 to life.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.747
Here she is, your
personal favorite.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.450
Oh, Phyllis "gag me" Zimmer.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.952
What a waste of boobs.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.889
I can't believe Dan
ever took her out.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.558
He never took her out.

12:38.658 --> 12:39.459
What?

12:39.559 --> 12:41.228
When did he take her out?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.063
That week you guys broke up.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.297
No way.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.934
He never told you that?

12:47.034 --> 12:49.169
No.

12:49.269 --> 12:54.174
Well, wasn't important.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.880
That's a very pretty
dress you have on.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.788
Bob, we thought
that this spot here

13:08.889 --> 13:10.057
would be good for the photo.

13:10.157 --> 13:13.326
Oh, yeah, so this is nice.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.129
Now how many people will be
participating in the photo?

13:16.229 --> 13:17.530
Three children and two adults.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.999
Splendid.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.133
Where's Becky?

13:20.233 --> 13:22.202
Oh, she went upstairs
to change again.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.203
Well go get her.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.838
We're getting ready
to start here.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.173
Do you have to go
to the bathroom?

13:26.273 --> 13:27.074
No.

13:27.174 --> 13:27.975
Are you sure?

13:31.845 --> 13:33.914
Rosie, this is Bob
Keeler from Flash Photo.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.248
Hi, Bob.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.085
Hello.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.087
You have a lovely home.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.021
Thank you.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.391
Well, it keeps me
off the streets.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.694
You know, we thought
that this would

13:47.794 --> 13:49.496
be a good spot for the picture.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.098
Hmm, I don't know.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.902
Do you think Phyllis
would like it?

13:55.002 --> 13:56.836
Why should we care
what she thinks?

13:56.937 --> 14:01.308
Because 15 years ago we
dated her behind our back.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.778
What are you talking about?

14:05.879 --> 14:07.847
15 years of lies.

14:07.948 --> 14:08.748
What?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.651
Well, we ready here to start?

14:11.751 --> 14:13.220
No.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.089
You went out with her and you
didn't even tell me about it.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.225
Rosie, Bob here is on
a very tight schedule.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.827
Can this possibly wait?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.662
Another 15 years?

14:22.762 --> 14:23.863
Should I leave?

14:23.964 --> 14:26.967
No, Bob, you're a man.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.801
Let me ask you a question.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.571
Do you think it's a
lousy, low-down sleazebag

14:31.671 --> 14:36.209
thing to do to lie to your
own wife for 15 years?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.445
How many years?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.247
As long as we're giving
somebody the third degree,

14:40.347 --> 14:41.681
let's start with your sister.

14:41.781 --> 14:42.950
You leave her out of this.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.952
Why does she have to butt
her nose in our business?

14:45.052 --> 14:46.853
Hey, it's your
fault. Not hers.

14:46.954 --> 14:47.787
Jackie?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.189
JACKIE: Yeah?

14:49.289 --> 14:52.659
ROSEANNE: You're the one that
went out with Phyllis, not her.

14:52.759 --> 14:53.660
Thanks, big mouth.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.561
What?

14:54.661 --> 14:55.862
You had to blab about Phyllis.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.598
Sorry, Dan, I thought you
would have told her by now.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.968
There was nothing to tell.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.302
It was one measly date.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.804
If it was so measly, how
come you didn't tell me when

15:04.904 --> 15:06.639
we first got back together?

15:06.739 --> 15:07.975
Jackie said not to.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.210
Oh, so you're the one that's
responsible for keeping me

15:10.310 --> 15:11.211
in the dark.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.512
You guys were
already back together.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.047
What's the point
of bringing it up?

15:14.147 --> 15:16.583
Yeah, honey, it
was no big deal.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.850
I was trying to protect you.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.719
Well, if it was no
big deal, what were

15:19.819 --> 15:21.554
you trying to protect me from?

15:21.654 --> 15:23.290
Roseanne, it was
a long time ago.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.125
Well, I got to
get out of here.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.693
I got some better things to do.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.564
Come on, Rosie, we
got a picture to take.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.566
It.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.335
Hey, I just want to
know why you went out

15:35.435 --> 15:36.970
with her in the first place?

15:37.070 --> 15:38.138
Roseanne, you dumped me.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.306
What was I supposed to do?

15:39.406 --> 15:43.510
Go to your grave
wanting me back.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.545
I did want you back.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.781
Yeah, well you got a
funny way of showing it.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.783
What did you do on this date?

15:50.883 --> 15:51.684
Nothing.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.821
Get more specific than that.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.323
She hopped on my motorcycle.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.857
We went for a ride.

15:57.957 --> 15:58.791
So that's all you did.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.027
You just rolled around.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.428
Yeah.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.430
Yeah, and you
didn't stop any place?

16:03.530 --> 16:04.331
I don't remember.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.566
We just rolled around.

16:06.666 --> 16:12.005
Just riding, riding, riding
around, not stopping anywhere.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.241
We might have
stopped someplace.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.708
Like where?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.510
- Rosie--
- Where?

16:17.610 --> 16:18.711
What difference does it make?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.381
Because I want to know.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.282
Watchout Hill.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.189
DARLENE: Are we ever
going to do this?

16:29.289 --> 16:30.057
In a minute.

16:32.692 --> 16:33.960
Roseanne, you broke my heart.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.599
Did you do it with her?

16:39.699 --> 16:42.335
Come on, Roseanne.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.271
Did you?

16:44.371 --> 16:45.172
Yes.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.380
We're ready when you are.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.116
We may have to do
this another day.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.218
No, we can do it right now.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.719
We'll do it now.

16:59.819 --> 17:00.620
You sure?

17:00.720 --> 17:01.654
Yeah, let's take the picture.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.263
DAN: Roseanne, I'm sorry.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.580
The kids are all tucked in.

17:31.718 --> 17:32.919
What you watching?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.024
DJ was so cute.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.526
He wanted to know if
we're getting a divorce.

17:41.928 --> 17:42.729
Are we?

17:46.133 --> 17:48.701
Did I forget to tell you
I'm not talking to you.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.904
Look, I want to tell you
everything that happened.

17:52.004 --> 17:55.308
You've obviously mistaken
me for someone who cares.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.977
Look, when you broke
up with me, I don't know,

17:58.077 --> 18:00.813
I guess I was trying to
prove something to myself.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.948
I don't know why
I picked Phyllis.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.654
OK, I know.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.922
But she just broke up
with her boyfriend.

18:10.022 --> 18:10.990
I ran into her at a party.

18:11.090 --> 18:11.924
We went for a ride.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.927
We wound up on the hill.

18:15.027 --> 18:18.365
And it just sort of happened.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.266
It didn't mean anything.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.170
Could you explain that to me?

18:23.270 --> 18:25.772
Can you tell me how you, you
know, make love with somebody

18:25.872 --> 18:28.040
and it doesn't mean nothing?

18:28.141 --> 18:29.442
Well, you start
with a case of beer.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.584
Then go get me a case
of beer so I can shower

18:37.684 --> 18:38.951
up with the Chicago Bears.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.457
Oh hell, honey, they're
not even a good team anymore.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.662
Oh, mean something, mean
something-- why does it

18:49.762 --> 18:51.164
always have to mean something?

18:51.264 --> 18:52.064
I don't know, Dan.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.167
I just always thought it did.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.937
Look, what happened that
long ago doesn't have anything

18:58.037 --> 18:59.706
to do with you and me now.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.073
Yes, it does.

19:01.174 --> 19:04.577
Because you are the one person
I thought I could trust.

19:04.677 --> 19:05.945
I still am.

19:06.045 --> 19:06.846
Nothing's changed.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.117
Then how come I'm
sitting here wondering what

19:11.218 --> 19:12.219
else I don't know about you?

19:15.722 --> 19:17.524
Well, I'm asking
you to trust me.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.631
God, I hate you.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.567
I hate you too, baby.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.002
No one else has ever mattered.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.938
Then why did you go all
out over this picture?

19:34.607 --> 19:37.577
Did you think I was
doing this for Phyllis?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.679
I was doing this for us.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.448
I'm proud of this family.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.217
I'm proud of the fact that
we've been married 15 years.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.253
You know how amazing that is?

19:46.353 --> 19:50.990
Yeah, pretty amazing
considering I can't stand you.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.759
Everybody said we
got married too young,

19:52.859 --> 19:55.495
that we would never last.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.664
Here we are.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.499
Well, what do you
suppose our secret is?

20:02.235 --> 20:03.770
We can't afford
to pay two rents.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.576
Hey, give me some
of that there blanket.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.143
No.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.780
Come on, I'm freezing.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.248
Well, why don't you
go find old Phyllis

20:15.348 --> 20:18.184
to warm up your big old butt?

20:18.285 --> 20:21.588
Because nobody can warm
up my big old butt like you,

20:21.688 --> 20:30.196
baby cakes, honeypie, sugar
darling, snookie baby,

20:30.297 --> 20:31.831
et cetera, et cetera.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.869
This is nice.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.050
These shots turned
out pretty good.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.251
Eh, they're not too bad.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.486
I should have
wore my other belt.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.087
God, if you say one
more word about that belt,

20:55.187 --> 20:56.323
I'm going to
strangle you with it.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.359
You know, I don't
look so bad in these.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.193
You're not too ugly.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.562
In fact, I look pretty good.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.531
Can I take this one to school?

21:04.631 --> 21:08.768
Sure, Darlene's blocking my
softball trophy in that one.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.304
This is the one we want to
send in to the yearbook.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.841
No way!
My eyes are all closed up.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.209
We'll send in that one.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.110
Uh-uh.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.046
I'm making a face in that one.

21:20.146 --> 21:23.249
No, that's your regular face.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.717
I don't look like that.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.453
Yeah, you do.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.720
Well, we're not
sending in that one.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.155
Well, we're not
sending in the other one.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.357
Well, what are we going to do?

21:30.457 --> 21:33.760
Well-- well there's
always Yellowstone.

21:33.860 --> 21:37.196
Whoopi ki-yi-yay--

21:37.296 --> 21:39.332
BOTH: (SINGING) --get
along little doggie,

21:39.432 --> 21:47.006
you know that Wyoming
will be your new home.
