WEBVTT

03:18.865 --> 03:20.651
Sonofabitch.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.747
Asshole. Oh! Oh! Oh!

03:32.921 --> 03:35.503
I hope you weren't
making an ass out of me over there.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.881
You don't need me for that, bro.
Really?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.884
I just asked her if she'd pose
for my camera and she was like,

03:41.054 --> 03:43.261
“oh, no, that's exploiting women.”

03:43.432 --> 03:45.673
So she's a smart girl.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.513
No, not really. Just a typical American.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.643
She's American, huh?

03:52.274 --> 03:54.014
You're sick.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.812
What's her name?

03:56.987 --> 03:58.978
You'll have to find out for yourself.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.252
Hey, genius.
Let's get out of here, man. Come on.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.668
Lisa gets pissed
when she's kept waiting. Let's go.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.476
Man: Lzar.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.646
Where?

04:45.577 --> 04:46.862
Ok.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.948
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.842
Fuck! What the hell is this?

05:07.432 --> 05:11.550
Man: So, what do you make of him?
I'd swear he's been skinned alive.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.293
So anyway, after graduation,

05:47.472 --> 05:49.929
I was thinking about
heading back home to my parents,

05:50.100 --> 05:53.467
but dr Ramirez said
he was gonna extend my visas.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.135
Woman: Doing what? Um...

05:55.313 --> 05:56.913
I'd be working at the estuary, you know,

05:56.940 --> 05:58.305
taking care of the animals,

05:58.483 --> 06:01.190
counting the migratory species
as they come through.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.522
So you don't want to go work
for your parents, right?

06:03.697 --> 06:07.406
Well, if you'd let me finish, no, I don't.
Because I'd be getting paid.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.242
That's not funny.
I'm not... I'm sorry.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.869
Yeah. I'm... I'm disgusting?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.529
You enjoyed that.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.120
Oh, come. This is the cutest thing. Look.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.159
So over-the-top.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.794
I want a pair.
Like you don't have enough.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.707
I don't care.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.842
It's excellent.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.134
God.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.546
How much are these?

07:13.725 --> 07:15.465
15.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.513
But for you, 10.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.304
Oh, thank you. Come on, money.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.810
Take five.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.771
Which ones do you like?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.153
Green? Orange? Green? Orange?

07:28.323 --> 07:30.814
I smell grilled fish.
Are you hungry? Let's go.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.160
Man: Don't touch that.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.834
Unless you like to play with fire.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.745
Haven't played with dolls in a while.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.623
Take a hair of someone you don't like

07:48.802 --> 07:50.292
and tie it around the doll.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.089
Tear off its arms,
poke out its eyes, see what happens.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.881
I've seen it. It's voodoo.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.767
I don't believe that shit.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.270
Americans only believe
in money, right?

08:02.440 --> 08:04.271
Right. Yeah, that's us.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.149
So I guess that would make me
just like you, then. Huh?

08:07.320 --> 08:11.359
Oh, I'm sorry. You're here
doing volunteer work? Is that it?

08:15.954 --> 08:17.740
That's a fancy trick.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.717
Freak show.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.629
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.422
I didn't mean to offend you.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.512
Oh. Seem like a nice guy.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.180
Let me make it up to you.
Maybe I have something for you.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.266
Yeah?

08:48.445 --> 08:53.030
You strike me as a young man
with unfulfilled wishes, desires.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.775
Doesn't everybody?

08:56.953 --> 08:59.820
Yeah. Yeah, but everybody's not here.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.743
Just you, me...

09:04.044 --> 09:05.534
And habibti.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.586
It's some old game called mamba.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.343
Man: Mamba?
Mamba. That's what he said.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.348
Would you have some respect?
Get... get... give it to me.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.637
I swear, you're, like, 10 years old.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.690
Frickin' weird guy runs the shop
back there gave it to me.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.403
Free?

09:38.995 --> 09:40.531
That should tell you what it's worth.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.366
Toss it. Toss it?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.405
Sorry, are you uncultured?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.040
This is an antique.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.702
It just came from
the Spanish inquisition, he said.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.917
I bet that if you look at it close enough,
it says 'made in China'.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.586
That's funny.
Both of you, you're very funny.

10:31.131 --> 10:35.545
Whoa. Check out that camel toe, man.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.676
Dude, that actually belongs
to another chick.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.133
I photoshopped it in.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.672
It's hot, right?

10:42.851 --> 10:44.887
Well, it's not bad.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.302
I think it would look better
on my face.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.065
You dirty pig.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.692
You dirty pig.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.980
Well, do you ever hook up with
any of these girls?

10:58.158 --> 11:01.400
I mean, you know...

11:01.578 --> 11:03.068
Besides Lisa.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.205
I boned them all, man. Bullshit!

11:07.375 --> 11:08.740
No way.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.001
Every single one.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.714
Go get some ass! Ok, come on.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.882
Gol

11:33.943 --> 11:35.683
Am I interrupting something?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.152
Didn't know you were here.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.443
Yeah, I just cruise around, you know.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.282
Sometimes I fly.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.697
I'll remember that.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.368
Your friend is not so shy.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.501
Yeah, Tomas, he's a...

11:57.675 --> 11:59.381
He's a smooth cat.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.918
He waits till I'm strapping everything
to the top of a truck

12:02.096 --> 12:03.427
to go and make his move.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.929
I'm Erica.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.636
Jason. Yeah, I know.

12:09.395 --> 12:13.729
Beer? You want a beer?
No, sit... down.

12:16.611 --> 12:20.945
So you're from the states. What brings
you to this side of the world?

12:21.115 --> 12:23.902
I'm trying to find myself,
you know, like they say.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.613
Right.

12:25.787 --> 12:29.575
And what about you?
Are you nursing a broken heart or...

12:29.749 --> 12:32.206
No. No. Please, it's nothing
that mysterious.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.584
Just a graduate student.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.499
What have we here?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.715
Mamba.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.427
It's what it's called.
Supposedly it's magic.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.718
What kind of magic?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.227
Black or white?

12:53.398 --> 12:55.980
It's grey, but... I don't know.

12:56.150 --> 13:00.359
Apparently, the winner
gets their heart's desire.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.021
A wish.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.154
You don't really believe that,
now, do you?

13:07.328 --> 13:11.537
No, come on. I... I could care less.
I'm not superstitious. But...

13:12.959 --> 13:15.416
I don't know. You never know.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.293
Mmm, che bello.

13:22.385 --> 13:26.219
I love it the way the air feels
before it rains.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.510
Negative ions.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.052
I think it's a bit more than that.

13:34.230 --> 13:38.269
So, what are you up to this summer?

13:38.443 --> 13:42.231
Well, I'm definitely
gonna work on my tan.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.818
The usual. Shopping, partying.

13:46.826 --> 13:47.861
What about you?

13:48.036 --> 13:50.948
Well, Tomas is taking me
to Amsterdam.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.617
Really? Yeah.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.157
Interesting.

13:56.336 --> 14:01.171
We're gonna get high,
go to some sex clubs.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.749
Wow. This thing is bizarre.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.258
Let's play.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.136
What? Right now?
Yeah. Come on. It'll be fun.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.889
And besides,
don't you want your wish to come true?

14:29.786 --> 14:30.616
Hi.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.698
I thought you said
we were going to Amsterdam.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.987
What's up?

14:34.165 --> 14:37.578
Before you and Lisa get high
and go to all the hot sex clubs?

14:37.752 --> 14:39.242
Oh, yeah.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.546
Look...

14:41.631 --> 14:43.246
Ok, um...

14:44.634 --> 14:49.094
I was online booking tickets for us
and she walked in. Ok?

14:49.263 --> 14:50.594
What was I supposed to tell her?

14:50.765 --> 14:52.380
That so doesn't make me feel better.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.264
Listen.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.391
I can't help it if I met her first.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.184
You know you're the one. Hmm?

15:02.151 --> 15:03.311
Are you sure?

15:10.410 --> 15:11.866
Mm-hm.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.323
Ah!

15:15.498 --> 15:17.726
No, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! No. Ok!

15:17.750 --> 15:19.991
You know, I don't think
it's the right place to do it.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.534
I just... no. Uh...

15:21.712 --> 15:23.043
Ok.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.499
Mmm.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.290
That's part of the fun, isn't it?
Ahh...

15:27.468 --> 15:29.925
Alrigh... ok, hurry.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.594
Oh, god.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.195
Tomas?

15:50.366 --> 15:52.197
I'm right here.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.654
Who's that?

15:56.831 --> 15:58.196
It's just me.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.659
I was thirsty.

16:25.067 --> 16:29.982
This is so lame, guys.
What are we, like, 10 years old?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.021
No, come on, you guys. I wanna play.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.033
Have fun, guys. I'm outta here.

16:35.203 --> 16:38.320
Come on, miss December.
Seven can play.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.863
Yeah. Don't you want a wish?

16:40.041 --> 16:41.121
Not really.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.374
You're playing. Come on.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.465
Just to kick your ass.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.847
Alright. Alright, alright, alright.
Come on.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.384
So everybody knows who they are. Yes?

17:01.562 --> 17:04.053
In the game, we're not so much
playing against each other

17:04.232 --> 17:05.938
as we are playing
against the game, ok?

17:06.108 --> 17:09.350
So it's a lot like craps.
It's like Blackjack, what have you.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.271
Everybody could win.
Everybody could lose.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.813
Yes.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.277
Ok, I'm first.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.535
It's a good idea to start rolling, genius.

17:36.973 --> 17:40.636
Eight! Opal!

17:46.357 --> 17:48.643
Now what? Windows of heaven.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.149
Yes!

17:50.319 --> 17:53.026
It's actually a safe square,
so you don't have to take a card.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.528
Next.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.155
That would be me.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.739
Nine.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.584
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.790
Nine. Open graves.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.547
That's good. That's great.
It's a good start.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.710
Thanks. Don't touch me.
We talked about that.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.173
You have to take a card.

18:22.351 --> 18:27.516
“If you could see inside,
you'd know what's false or true.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.478
“'Someone's head bursts open,
but none of it gets on you.”

18:31.652 --> 18:35.395
A head bursting open. Cool.
I'd like to see that.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.438
Play on.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.154
Lucky seven.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.959
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.085
Open grave. So, what?

18:52.256 --> 18:53.837
You take a card.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.126
“Epitaph.”

18:58.304 --> 18:59.965
What the hell?

19:00.139 --> 19:04.508
“The salamander lives in two worlds,
unlike the horny toad.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.678
“Something honest from the sea
will greet you by the road.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.222
“Vae victis.”

19:15.988 --> 19:17.569
What's vae victis?

19:19.575 --> 19:22.032
It's Latin for 'losers, weepers'.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.785
You mean I'm out?
Yeah, you're done. Thanks.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.618
This sucks. Give me Xbox any day.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.493
Why don't you hop in the car
and make a beer run?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.539
Come on, give me a break.
You know my car is in the shop.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.549
Alright. Here, take mine.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.425
Thanks.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.908
Did you really just say...? You said
“naughty nines'. It's very creative.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.785
Thanks.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.947
Open grave. I take a card.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.456
Madam.

20:10.626 --> 20:16.087
“You were thrown into the cauldron,
but, amazingly, you float.

20:16.257 --> 20:20.500
“You may continue playing,
but don't forget your goat.”

20:23.514 --> 20:26.472
That's a turn-on.
I didn't know you had a goat.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.883
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.641
J yeah, give itto me... j

20:51.876 --> 20:56.290
Erica: Ah, meet your fate.
Miguel: Um, can't I roll again?

20:56.464 --> 20:59.126
I'm not feeling that lucky.
Tomas: Pussy.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.631
Go.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.087
For you, sir.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.550
Thanks.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.806
Shit. Epitaph. I knew it.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.183
Come on, come on, read.

21:11.353 --> 21:14.971
“Up from the earth
that dreams coming true,

21:15.149 --> 21:18.812
“sweet venomous kisses annihilate you.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.147
“Vae victis.”

21:21.322 --> 21:25.235
Jason: Ouch! Sorry about that.
You're dead. Next.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.394
A three.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.278
One, two, three.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.030
One, two, three.

22:09.370 --> 22:13.204
Windows of heaven.
Well, at least you're safe.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.438
Help!

22:44.196 --> 22:46.403
Help!

23:05.885 --> 23:07.716
Tomas: Go ahead, come on. Spit it.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.299
Lisa: Epitaph. Miguel: Mm-mm.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.890
“There are two sides
to the mirror, my friend.

23:16.353 --> 23:20.687
“When the bright side turns on you,
the black side takes you in.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.314
“Vae victis.”

23:22.484 --> 23:25.351
I was getting tired of this anyway.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.461
Alright. Where the hell's Pablo?

24:29.635 --> 24:32.502
I really hope he didn't wreck my car.

24:36.684 --> 24:40.176
Dammit! Can I just start again?

24:40.354 --> 24:43.096
No guts, no glory. Fine.

24:46.110 --> 24:49.602
“Yesterday was shown
through tomorrows yet unknown.

24:49.780 --> 24:52.567
“Wishes of a star,
you are smoke ascending very far.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.697
“Vae victis.”

24:54.868 --> 24:56.984
I didn't wanna play to begin with.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.778
Alright, look, once I win,
I'm gonna wish I won the lottery,

24:59.957 --> 25:01.743
and I'll cut you all in, ok?

25:01.917 --> 25:03.578
Miguel: Can we get that in writing?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.583
No, I'm talking about just a little taste.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.086
Not half or anything.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.379
What do we got?

25:18.559 --> 25:21.175
Well, the engine was still running.
And the tank's over half full.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.219
Do we know who he is?

25:24.398 --> 25:26.354
Yeah. We got his wallet and some ID.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.857
Good. Bring it over.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.360
Alright, lzar.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.034
Oh. Six.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.749
One, two, three, four, five...

25:49.923 --> 25:52.335
Six.

25:52.509 --> 25:55.342
Are you kidding me?
Come on, big shot. It's just a game.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.343
Take a card.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.469
Ow.

26:01.727 --> 26:04.264
I“ . H.” pier

26:04.438 --> 26:07.225
what happened? But you're gonna win
the lottery and... and...

26:07.399 --> 26:10.106
You're just not talking as much.
Let's read that card right now.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.608
Let's see what that says.

26:11.779 --> 26:14.737
“He who has eyes but cannot see

26:14.907 --> 26:19.617
'must lie with the worms
and feed the trees.”

26:19.787 --> 26:23.780
That was a wasted night. I'm sorry.
You didn't have to play.

26:23.957 --> 26:28.075
About time.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.966
Man, where the hell
did you go with my car?

26:45.938 --> 26:48.304
Tomas escana? Yeah.

26:50.692 --> 26:53.104
Whoa, hey. Uh...
How can I help you?

26:53.278 --> 26:54.734
Nice night for a party.

26:54.905 --> 26:57.863
Yeah. It is.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.575
You don't have any narcotics
in there, do you?

27:01.829 --> 27:04.992
No, sir, no. We're just some friends
hanging out from school.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.489
I'm detective lzar.

27:08.502 --> 27:11.619
Do you own
a hew-model pick-up, green?

27:12.673 --> 27:13.958
Pablo.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.873
What... what... what happened?

27:16.051 --> 27:17.587
There's been an accident.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.843
I'm sorry, kid.

27:20.013 --> 27:22.049
I'll need you to come down
to the station with me

27:22.224 --> 27:23.509
to give a positive ID.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.640
Oh, my god.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.202
Hey.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.246
Hey.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.584
It's really nice of you to come.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.559
I know you didn't
really know him or anything.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.050
I thought I should.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.299
The card he drew that night...

28:49.478 --> 28:50.593
What?

28:50.771 --> 28:53.558
The game. Mamba.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.064
I remember it said something like...

28:56.235 --> 29:00.478
"Something honest from the sea
will greet you by the road.”

29:00.656 --> 29:02.567
Yeah.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.365
Isn't that what happened to him?

29:05.535 --> 29:10.370
I don't know. I mean, is there
anything honest about crabs?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.906
Well, sort of.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.041
They're this primal force -

29:15.212 --> 29:18.670
you know, these mindless things
driven by instinct.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.175
Yeah, I guess. It's, um...

29:24.346 --> 29:27.759
It's an interesting way of looking at it.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.352
Can I get a ride? Yeah.

30:02.634 --> 30:06.001
This is trippy.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.966
Don't think I've ever known anybody
who lived in a lighthouse.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.302
It's quiet.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.387
I can think.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.484
Edgar Allan poe, bram stoker,
the 'necronomicon',

30:22.654 --> 30:24.861
'catholic rites of exorcism'.

30:25.032 --> 30:29.150
You're a goth girl in a wetsuit.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.784
Thanks for the ride.

30:31.872 --> 30:34.614
Yeah, sure. It's no big deal. It's...

30:42.215 --> 30:44.126
Right.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.584
Um...

30:46.762 --> 30:48.844
It's a really great place. It's...

30:50.223 --> 30:52.054
I'm gonna get going, so...

30:52.225 --> 30:55.092
I'll... see you later.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.603
So I'm gonna see you
again soon, I hope.

30:58.774 --> 31:02.266
Yeah. That's up to you.

31:03.445 --> 31:06.152
Ok. 'Bye.

31:06.323 --> 31:07.938
'Bye.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.705
Miguel: Hey. Lisa: Hello.

31:22.172 --> 31:24.163
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.297
You know how feisty
models get sometimes.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.010
Not really.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.265
But I'd love to find out.

31:36.436 --> 31:39.018
I bet you would, buddy.

31:42.317 --> 31:45.684
So this is your uncle's place, yeah?
Yeah.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.945
This has been in my family
for three generations.

31:51.118 --> 31:55.077
I bet that's what you tell
all the women, right?

31:55.247 --> 31:58.580
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

31:59.584 --> 32:03.042
What? I'm not wearing these shoes.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.874
What do you think, I'm a drag queen?

32:05.048 --> 32:07.004
I want this to be, like, classy, you know?

32:07.175 --> 32:08.585
It is classy, ok?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.716
Honestly, how many guys
are gonna buy a calendar

32:10.887 --> 32:12.297
based on what day it is?

32:12.472 --> 32:14.758
Come on, go give her the axe. Let's go.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.889
Come on, Miguel, what do you think?

32:18.061 --> 32:21.553
I'm sorry, Lisa. I'm with Tomas.

32:21.731 --> 32:24.564
I don't care what day it is.
See? He even agrees with me.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.520
Let's shoot this thing. Come on.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.653
Let's go. It's just me and Miguel.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.404
Be sexy. What?

32:31.575 --> 32:35.534
Let's go.
What do you want me to do with it?

32:35.704 --> 32:39.413
Just... do whatever that hot,
tight little body tells you to do

32:39.583 --> 32:40.948
and start chopping.

32:41.126 --> 32:44.744
Let it go. Come on.
Just let it go. Let it go.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.503
That's it. Be sexy. Please.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.461
Good. There you go.
There you go. That looks good.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.217
Alright, shake your legs.
Shake your legs for me.

32:53.388 --> 32:56.380
Get down. That's it. Alright.
Move, move. Come back around here.

32:56.558 --> 32:57.889
Look at me, right here.

32:58.059 --> 33:01.222
There you go. There you go, baby.
That's it. That's how you do it.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.956
Alright, smile. Give me that cute
little sexy smile. Right there.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.601
That's good. Right there.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.686
Alright, kick your hair back like this.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.648
Alright, now, shake your Booty.
Come on! Just like that.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.108
Good. That's it. Good.
Turn to me. Shake your hair.

33:13.283 --> 33:16.491
Yeah. That's what
I'm talking about, baby. Let's go.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.322
Come on. Hey! Go give her the thing.

33:19.581 --> 33:23.324
Alright, use that, use that.
Go ahead. There you go.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.289
That's my girl. That's right.
Alright, shake it. Go ahead.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.419
Arch your back for me.
Let me see your back.

33:28.590 --> 33:31.047
Good. Let me see your smile.
Let me see you smile.

33:31.218 --> 33:32.583
Let me see that smile.

33:32.761 --> 33:35.218
Good. Shake your legs.
Shake your legs for me.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.969
Get down. That's it. Alright.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.506
Come back around here.
Look at me, right here.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.891
There you go. That's a good girl!

33:42.062 --> 33:44.644
Give me a smile.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.931
That's it. Look right at me.
Ok, now turn around. Turn around.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.849
Let me see that. Let me see your profile.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.609
Right. Put your axe up.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.739
Let me see your teeth. Smile.

34:01.998 --> 34:05.240
Stop, please.
We're not finished yet. Let's go.

34:05.418 --> 34:07.033
I'm just not feeling well.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.919
What's wrong with you?
I don't know.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.183
Damn! I forgot my filter.
No, no, no. It's ok.

34:27.357 --> 34:30.019
She's very pale. Uh, I'll find your filter.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.808
Ok? Alright. Cool. Thanks.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.693
Yeah.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.412
You alright?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.414
Just take me home, please.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.701
Take me home.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.065
Here you are.

36:35.151 --> 36:38.234
Shit. What's going on here?

38:39.776 --> 38:43.394
Erica: Wow. This is where you work?
This is amazing.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.186
Yeah, I feel pretty lucky.

38:45.365 --> 38:48.482
It's so peaceful.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.026
It's a wildlife sanctuary.

38:51.204 --> 38:55.447
This place is like a refuge
from the outside world.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.577
This whole coast here used to have
four times the amount of wildlife.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.209
And then the people came.

39:04.968 --> 39:08.677
We think alike. Mmm. Who knows?

39:08.847 --> 39:11.304
Another life,
we might have been friends.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.590
That would be swell.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.139
Let's go.

40:26.382 --> 40:28.873
Well. How are you, detective?

40:29.052 --> 40:30.633
Yeah, how are you, Nielsen?

40:35.391 --> 40:36.972
Looking for ideas for Halloween?

40:39.979 --> 40:41.890
Snakebites.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.765
Snakes? Around these parts?

40:46.819 --> 40:53.110
Convulsions, respiratory paralysis.
The poor kid suffocated to death.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.444
Dendroaspis polylepis.

40:58.498 --> 40:59.954
Say that again?

41:00.959 --> 41:02.699
Black mamba.

41:02.877 --> 41:05.209
How does that bite you, huh?

41:05.380 --> 41:07.837
Any time you want, Harvey.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.436
What?

41:24.482 --> 41:27.224
It's not that much further.
Yeah.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.195
Shit!

41:45.253 --> 41:47.118
You saw that, right? It looked like Pablo.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.002
Miguel was with him.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.458
Pablo's dead.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.013
Hello.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.134
What?

42:02.311 --> 42:03.892
I can't believe this shit, man.

42:04.063 --> 42:07.271
It was Miguel. He was standing
right there in front of me.

42:07.442 --> 42:10.730
And he even waved goodbye to us.
And now he's gone.

42:10.903 --> 42:12.313
Ok, so, what happened exactly?

42:12.488 --> 42:14.149
He was bitten by snakes, man.

42:14.323 --> 42:15.688
Snakes? Yeah.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.232
More than one?

42:17.410 --> 42:20.322
He had, like,
dozens of bites all over him.

42:20.496 --> 42:23.784
His face, he was bitten all over,
and he was black and blue.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.040
His tongue was hanging
out of his mouth, man.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.871
That card, what did it say?

42:28.046 --> 42:29.877
What card?
The game that we played.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.460
Miguel drew a card
and it said something like,

42:32.633 --> 42:35.466
'sweet venomous kisses annihilate you.”

42:35.636 --> 42:37.376
That's exactly
what happened to him, huh?

42:37.555 --> 42:38.635
What are you talking about?

42:38.806 --> 42:42.424
When Pablo died, Erica noticed

42:42.602 --> 42:45.184
that it was exactly like
the game predicted, you know?

42:45.354 --> 42:47.936
Are you kidding me, man?
Listen to me, alright?

42:48.107 --> 42:50.689
“Something honest from the sea
will greet you by the road.”

42:50.860 --> 42:53.047
That's exactly what happened.
Now Miguel. This is the same thing.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.356
Are you nuts?

42:54.530 --> 42:56.771
Yeah, we all got
those epitaph cards, didn't we?

42:56.949 --> 42:59.190
Ex... except you two!

42:59.368 --> 43:02.656
This is ridiculous talk, man. Come on.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.320
This is just some weird coincidence.

43:04.499 --> 43:07.299
It's got nothing to do with what's
going on. It doesn't make any sense.

43:07.376 --> 43:09.788
Ok, so you come up with
something better, alright?

43:09.962 --> 43:12.499
On the way over here,
we drove right past Miguel and Pablo

43:12.673 --> 43:14.163
standing in the middle of the road.

43:14.342 --> 43:16.378
I stop the car,
I turn around, they're gone.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.837
What are you smoking, man?

43:18.012 --> 43:22.221
Dude, something is going on here!
Our friends are dying, Jason.

43:22.391 --> 43:25.599
Yeah. I realise that. It's not an accident.

43:41.410 --> 43:46.074
Welcome. Let's... just, uh, grab a seat.
The game is right here.

43:57.510 --> 43:59.501
Here take half.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.382
Here they are.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.559
Yeah, this is Lisa's card.

44:09.730 --> 44:12.813
“There are two sides to the mirror,
my friend.

44:12.984 --> 44:16.476
“When the bright side turns on you,
the black side takes you in.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.315
“Vae victis.”

44:45.099 --> 44:46.430
Erica, listen to this.

44:46.601 --> 44:48.137
You find something?

44:48.311 --> 44:49.972
Yeah. Mamba...

44:50.146 --> 44:52.558
“The mamba game was fabricated
from the skin and bones

44:52.732 --> 44:54.973
“of a witch named mamba masamba,

44:55.151 --> 44:57.233
“who was tried
and subsequently skinned alive

44:57.403 --> 44:59.359
“by the grand high inquisitor
torguemada

44:59.530 --> 45:01.441
“during the dreaded Spanish inquisition

45:01.616 --> 45:03.322
“of the late 15th century.”

45:03.492 --> 45:04.948
Wow.

45:05.119 --> 45:07.110
Uh, “the board is made from her skin,

45:07.288 --> 45:11.247
“and the designs on it were painted
with her blood and tears.”

45:12.752 --> 45:14.788
My god. What else?

45:14.962 --> 45:17.874
'Possession of the game
sooh became the obsession

45:18.049 --> 45:19.585
“of the greedy and desperate

45:19.759 --> 45:21.778
“due to its reputed ability
to Grant the heart's desire

45:21.802 --> 45:24.134
“of one who plays and wins.

45:24.305 --> 45:27.422
“'Hapless losers, however,
face twisted fates

45:27.600 --> 45:29.511
“assigned to them
by the game's quatrains -

45:29.685 --> 45:32.347
'enigmatic verses of unknown origin.”

45:34.315 --> 45:35.771
You were right.

45:37.652 --> 45:41.565
“The game remained an object
of curiosity for European society

45:41.739 --> 45:44.731
“until a French merchant ship carrying it
was raided by pirates

45:44.909 --> 45:47.651
“near the straits of Gibraltar in 1808.”

45:48.621 --> 45:50.327
What are you doing?

45:52.208 --> 45:54.620
We might need it.
Nope. It's burning.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.207
Jason, stop! No!

45:59.382 --> 46:00.918
Look, you're bleeding.

46:16.524 --> 46:18.765
Hey, hey, hey. What's up?
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

46:18.943 --> 46:22.151
What's up? What's wrong?
What's wrong with you? Huh?

46:22.321 --> 46:25.108
You know, I don't feel well.
Ok, ok, look.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.444
You're a bit warm, huh?

46:27.618 --> 46:29.654
Look, you're coming down
with something.

46:29.829 --> 46:32.696
No, no, I just wanna go home.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

46:32.873 --> 46:34.738
Lie down.
You're too sick to drive.

46:34.917 --> 46:37.203
Come here. Come here.

46:37.378 --> 46:39.664
I'm gonna get you some soup
or something, huh?

46:41.007 --> 46:44.966
You want to make me throw up.
Funny. No. Not in my bed.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.467
Bleurgh!

46:46.637 --> 46:49.720
I'm gonna get you some tea, ok?

46:49.890 --> 46:51.676
Green. Green.

46:56.314 --> 46:57.679
Hey, Tomas.

46:59.775 --> 47:04.018
Do you think this has something
to do with that game?

47:06.240 --> 47:07.776
Absolutely not.

47:07.950 --> 47:10.942
We're all under
some kind of stress, you know?

47:11.120 --> 47:13.202
It's got nothing to do with the game.

47:15.207 --> 47:16.697
Ok.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.391
Tomas.

47:36.562 --> 47:39.645
Tomas.

47:42.234 --> 47:44.646
Tomas.

47:47.865 --> 47:50.026
Oh, shit!

48:13.307 --> 48:16.674
Excuse me. I'm detective lzar.
Your friend Tomas called me.

48:16.852 --> 48:18.717
He did?

48:20.106 --> 48:21.892
She was a beautiful young lady.

48:23.818 --> 48:25.604
Ok, can we go and see her?

48:25.778 --> 48:28.019
Tomas told me about
this game you played. Uh...

48:28.197 --> 48:30.842
Look, we understand that it sounds
crazy, but if you just give us...

48:30.866 --> 48:33.733
I had a word with the coroner
and she said that your friend Miguel died

48:33.911 --> 48:35.492
from a massive dose of neurotoxin?

48:35.663 --> 48:36.493
Yeah.

48:36.664 --> 48:39.326
The venom of a snake
not even found in this part of the world.

48:39.500 --> 48:40.831
Black mamba.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.707
The game we played, it's called mamba.

48:42.878 --> 48:44.789
I'll need to have a look at that game.

48:44.964 --> 48:46.420
Sure. It's back at my place.

48:46.590 --> 48:48.672
Your place?

48:50.469 --> 48:53.051
Well, I have to go. We'll talk later.
Thank you.

48:53.222 --> 48:55.008
Guys? Guys?

48:55.182 --> 48:57.639
Have you seen her?
No, we just got here. Come on.

49:11.490 --> 49:12.980
No.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.748
That's not Lisa!

49:53.824 --> 49:55.155
Hey!

50:02.625 --> 50:03.625
Elena!

50:10.299 --> 50:11.960
No... I... I...

50:12.134 --> 50:13.134
Calm down.

50:15.471 --> 50:17.678
I need you on this, ok?

50:17.848 --> 50:19.429
Yeah.

50:19.600 --> 50:20.885
Calm down.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.433
Tomas.

50:30.611 --> 50:31.896
Lisa.

50:32.071 --> 50:33.402
Hey.

50:33.572 --> 50:35.938
Hey, it's Jason. And Erica's here.
Remember Erica?

50:38.035 --> 50:40.071
Where's Tomas?

50:41.121 --> 50:44.363
Uh, he just went right up the hall.
He'll be right back.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.875
What happened to me?

50:54.009 --> 50:56.421
Elena, you're gonna stay with me.
You have to stay with me.

50:56.595 --> 50:58.381
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.012
I don't wanna be on my own.

51:00.182 --> 51:02.502
You're not gonna be on your own.
You're gonna stay with us?

51:02.560 --> 51:04.175
Wait!

51:04.353 --> 51:06.218
Where are you gonna go?
I don't know!

51:06.397 --> 51:07.837
Think it's gonna do any good to run?

51:07.982 --> 51:09.518
We're all gonna die! Don't you see it?

51:09.692 --> 51:12.354
Look! If you stay here,
we'll find a way out of this thing. Please!

51:12.528 --> 51:14.610
I want to go home! I'm going to Milan!

51:14.780 --> 51:16.361
Elena!

51:26.125 --> 51:27.456
Lisa.

51:27.626 --> 51:30.413
Lisa, come on. You've got to...
Call the head nurse, please.

51:32.047 --> 51:34.288
Woman: How can I help you?
Yes, we need someone in here.

51:34.466 --> 51:36.798
What's the problem?
We need help right now!

51:36.969 --> 51:39.255
Ok. Stay calm. Lisa, come on!

51:39.430 --> 51:41.270
You've gotta calm down.
Do you hear me? Calm...

51:54.612 --> 51:58.730
Oh, shit! Come on. She just...
She just stopped breathing. I don't know.

52:00.951 --> 52:02.782
Set for 200 joules.

52:05.164 --> 52:07.246
Ready?

52:16.925 --> 52:18.506
Adrenaline! Go!

52:20.804 --> 52:22.044
Ahl

52:30.147 --> 52:32.308
What happened, doctor?

52:36.320 --> 52:38.276
Hey.

52:47.915 --> 52:50.122
Come on. It's done. Come on.

52:50.292 --> 52:51.782
Come on.

53:05.349 --> 53:06.839
She was.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.632
She asked for me.

53:10.521 --> 53:13.684
I didn't... I wasn't there for her.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.807
Goddamn.

53:36.672 --> 53:38.208
Alright, this is great.

53:41.051 --> 53:43.007
Erica: Well, are you sure
this is the place?

53:44.930 --> 53:47.046
Jason: Yeah, I'm sure this is it.

53:47.224 --> 53:49.465
Let's go. Come on. Come on! Let's go.

53:59.361 --> 54:02.353
Alright. He said he knows the guy.
His name's malek. Alright?

54:02.531 --> 54:03.941
It's an abandoned house nearby.

54:04.116 --> 54:05.606
Let's go. Come on!

54:09.288 --> 54:11.870
Alright. Keep going straight
and take the next left.

54:12.040 --> 54:14.907
Alright. The guy at the bar
told me it's the house to the right.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.501
That must be it.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.141
No, no, no, no. Wait a minute.

54:33.312 --> 54:35.394
Let's just make sure
this is the place first.

54:50.871 --> 54:53.362
Tomas: Malek!

55:34.957 --> 55:37.037
What are you doing in my house?
Tomas: Alright, look.

55:37.084 --> 55:39.245
We just knocked on the door,
like, several times.

55:39.419 --> 55:41.410
Alright. What difference does it make?

55:41.588 --> 55:43.249
Calm down. Get out of here!

55:43.423 --> 55:45.038
Hey, calm down. We just want to...

55:45.217 --> 55:47.253
Don't come into my house
and tell me what to do.

55:47.427 --> 55:49.634
Get the fuck out of here!
We want to ask some questions!

55:49.805 --> 55:51.241
Wait a minute! It worked, didn't it?

55:51.265 --> 55:52.505
What are you talking about?

55:52.683 --> 55:55.550
You know what I'm talking about.
The game, it worked. You got your wish.

55:56.687 --> 55:58.473
You gotta help us.

55:58.647 --> 56:00.729
Nobody ever helped me.

56:25.132 --> 56:27.589
Nice. That's nice.

56:27.759 --> 56:29.624
I thought so.

56:35.767 --> 56:39.510
Elena: "Yesterday was shown
through tomorrows yet unknown.

56:39.688 --> 56:42.395
“Wishes of a star,
you are smoke ascending very far.

56:42.566 --> 56:44.352
“Vae victis.”

57:06.590 --> 57:07.921
Mamma!

57:25.734 --> 57:28.191
Man on radio:
If you really like your music...

57:30.614 --> 57:32.525
You just found it.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.985
It's your time.

58:15.117 --> 58:17.608
Help me! Help me!

58:25.168 --> 58:28.251
Help me! Help me!

58:30.674 --> 58:32.335
Help!

59:11.423 --> 59:15.917
Malek: What do you want? Revenge?
Go ahead. I just did what I had to do.

59:16.094 --> 59:19.382
Come on, man. People are dying.
Too bad. They're losers.

59:19.556 --> 59:22.093
Listen to me, you fat slob.

59:22.267 --> 59:24.912
I'll stick this thing right down your
throat if you don't communicate with us.

59:24.936 --> 59:28.394
How do we stop it?
It only stops when it's satisfied.

59:28.565 --> 59:31.022
When you pay what you owe.

59:31.193 --> 59:33.525
We didn't know. I mean, if we had,
we wouldn't have played.

59:33.695 --> 59:34.980
Only an idiot would.

59:35.155 --> 59:38.318
Well, you're looking at an idiot.

59:39.493 --> 59:42.109
Where'd you get the game?

59:42.287 --> 59:43.743
My brother.

59:46.291 --> 59:47.701
He played too.

59:47.876 --> 59:49.662
And he lost.

59:53.048 --> 59:55.414
He got skinned alive.

59:55.592 --> 59:58.459
I guess I should have wished
for him to come back, but...

59:58.637 --> 1:00:00.502
I wanted my legs more.

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:02.170
Listen to me.

1:00:02.349 --> 1:00:06.968
You help me keep my life,
you keep your legs.

1:00:07.145 --> 1:00:08.931
There's nothing I can do for you, boy.

1:00:09.106 --> 1:00:12.348
If you lost, you're gonna die.

1:00:12.526 --> 1:00:14.812
If I were you, I'd kill myself.
It's more humane.

1:00:14.986 --> 1:00:16.522
Sonofabitch!

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:23.817
Listen, she and I, we didn't lose.
We didn't finish the game.

1:00:23.995 --> 1:00:26.452
Just walk away. You're out.

1:00:26.623 --> 1:00:28.830
So, then, why did you give me
this thing anyway?

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.706
I'm sorry, boy.

1:00:30.877 --> 1:00:36.463
I had to pass it along to someone
or I wouldn't get my wish.

1:00:43.682 --> 1:00:45.513
No. No.

1:00:45.684 --> 1:00:47.390
No!

1:01:00.991 --> 1:01:02.777
What am I gonna do?

1:01:05.745 --> 1:01:07.326
Jason, look out!

1:01:19.384 --> 1:01:21.045
Did you see what I just saw?

1:01:21.219 --> 1:01:22.709
Yeah.

1:01:24.514 --> 1:01:26.675
Elena was with 'em.

1:01:26.850 --> 1:01:28.715
She's gone too.

1:01:31.438 --> 1:01:33.645
I'm next.

1:01:37.319 --> 1:01:40.311
I've gotta finish this game.
What are you talking about?

1:01:40.488 --> 1:01:45.152
If I win, I get a wish,
and I'd wish to undo all this shit.

1:01:45.327 --> 1:01:46.942
Yeah, and what if you lose?

1:02:05.347 --> 1:02:07.212
Detective lzar.

1:02:08.767 --> 1:02:10.632
Can... can I help you with something?

1:02:11.937 --> 1:02:13.268
Where is it?

1:02:13.438 --> 1:02:14.723
Where's what?

1:02:14.898 --> 1:02:17.856
The game. I want it.

1:02:18.026 --> 1:02:21.018
I... I...
You're out of luck. We don't have it.

1:02:21.196 --> 1:02:23.403
What? We threw it in the ocean.

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:27.699
What do you take me for?
Some kind of fucking idiot?

1:02:27.869 --> 1:02:29.825
Ok, look, that's not necessary.

1:02:29.996 --> 1:02:31.406
What do you want it for?

1:02:31.581 --> 1:02:35.073
Does it make a difference?
You don't understand. We need it.

1:02:35.252 --> 1:02:36.708
No, no, you don't understand.

1:02:38.505 --> 1:02:40.336
I want it, and I want it now.

1:02:40.507 --> 1:02:42.068
You don't even know
what you're asking for.

1:02:42.092 --> 1:02:43.492
That thing is gonna get you killed.

1:02:43.593 --> 1:02:45.800
I'm dead already, kid.

1:02:49.057 --> 1:02:50.922
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna do that.

1:02:51.101 --> 1:02:52.716
You're sorry?

1:02:52.894 --> 1:02:55.681
Come on, on the floor,
the three of you, right fucking now!

1:02:55.855 --> 1:02:58.813
Stop! Stop! Alright, just...

1:02:59.943 --> 1:03:02.025
Just stop. I'll get it.

1:03:17.752 --> 1:03:18.912
Run!

1:03:19.087 --> 1:03:20.372
Go! Go!

1:03:20.547 --> 1:03:22.458
Look!

1:03:32.934 --> 1:03:36.222
What are you charging me with?
I'll do the talking.

1:03:36.396 --> 1:03:38.165
You're making a big mistake.
Shut the fuck up!

1:03:38.189 --> 1:03:40.589
You're gonna lock me up?
You ain't gonna be that lucky. Move!

1:03:59.878 --> 1:04:01.209
Lizar: Erica vargas.

1:04:01.379 --> 1:04:03.745
V-a-r-g-a-s.

1:04:05.717 --> 1:04:07.127
No, I don't have a dob.

1:04:07.302 --> 1:04:08.633
Nothing, huh?

1:04:08.803 --> 1:04:10.839
Ok, ok. Thanks, rico.

1:04:12.057 --> 1:04:13.422
No, no. It's alright.

1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:15.556
No, I'm just heading home.

1:04:15.727 --> 1:04:17.638
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

1:04:23.443 --> 1:04:25.479
Tomas: Help! Get me out!
Fucking pill.

1:04:25.653 --> 1:04:27.268
Get me the hell out of here!

1:04:27.447 --> 1:04:29.608
Help! Help!

1:04:29.783 --> 1:04:31.114
Shut the fuck up!

1:04:31.284 --> 1:04:34.026
Get me out of here! Sonofabitch.

1:04:37.874 --> 1:04:39.956
What are you doing?
Answering your prayer.

1:04:40.126 --> 1:04:41.832
No. Absolutely not.

1:04:42.003 --> 1:04:44.836
Look, with two of us
there's twice the chance.

1:04:45.006 --> 1:04:47.497
Yeah, I'm not letting another person
get hurt by this thing.

1:04:47.675 --> 1:04:49.882
It was my idea to play in the first place.

1:05:23.962 --> 1:05:25.577
Get out!

1:05:26.631 --> 1:05:27.916
End of the line.

1:05:28.091 --> 1:05:30.503
Alright, cut the shit.
This ain't funny, man.

1:05:32.929 --> 1:05:34.885
Where does the girl live?
I don't know!

1:05:35.056 --> 1:05:38.048
I told you,
I met her at the beach a day ago.

1:05:38.226 --> 1:05:39.807
Every time I've seen you she was there.

1:05:39.978 --> 1:05:42.219
Look, I know my rights, alright?
Oh, yeah?

1:05:42.397 --> 1:05:44.558
I know my rights! I want a lawyer!

1:05:44.732 --> 1:05:47.269
See if you can dig one for yourself.

1:05:53.658 --> 1:05:55.364
Windows of heaven.

1:06:12.093 --> 1:06:13.378
What?

1:06:17.015 --> 1:06:18.926
What's it say?

1:06:21.144 --> 1:06:23.760
“Once by fire, your sins absolved.

1:06:25.732 --> 1:06:28.064
“In dark depths, you'll be dissolved.

1:06:31.571 --> 1:06:32.981
“Vae victis.”

1:06:33.156 --> 1:06:36.068
Something's gonna happen to me
in the ocean.

1:06:36.242 --> 1:06:38.358
You have to win.

1:06:52.759 --> 1:06:54.750
Why are you doing this to me?

1:06:56.054 --> 1:06:57.990
Tell me where your friends are.
I don't fucking...

1:06:58.014 --> 1:07:00.801
I don't know, man.
You gotta be reasonable with me.

1:07:00.975 --> 1:07:03.216
Keep digging or I'll drop you now!

1:07:05.522 --> 1:07:07.353
I don't deserve this, man.

1:07:09.526 --> 1:07:12.518
My boy is dead, and my wife!

1:07:12.695 --> 1:07:15.061
Did they deserve it?

1:07:17.325 --> 1:07:19.031
It happens every day.

1:07:19.202 --> 1:07:21.409
Only this time, it happened to me.

1:07:22.830 --> 1:07:24.195
Now, listen to me.

1:07:24.374 --> 1:07:29.869
I'm gonna get them back.
I'm gonna get that box, ok?

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:31.752
Come on, dig!

1:07:31.923 --> 1:07:33.413
Dig!

1:07:56.823 --> 1:07:59.815
Alright, so this is it.
I just need more than eight.

1:08:01.744 --> 1:08:03.405
More than eight.

1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:05.696
Come on.

1:08:19.012 --> 1:08:20.968
That's it! 11. That's it.

1:08:21.139 --> 1:08:22.470
Eight.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:25.723
That's it. I won, right?

1:08:25.893 --> 1:08:28.054
No, not yet.

1:08:28.229 --> 1:08:31.517
What do you mean, not yet?
I mean, we made it to the end.

1:08:31.691 --> 1:08:33.898
That's what we had to do.
There's just one more step.

1:08:34.068 --> 1:08:36.275
You make your wish,
then you have to take your piece

1:08:36.446 --> 1:08:38.402
and put it in one of
the two shakes' mouths.

1:08:38.573 --> 1:08:41.280
If you pick the right one
and the piece rolls out the bottom,

1:08:41.451 --> 1:08:43.191
then your wish comes true.

1:08:45.955 --> 1:08:48.037
Spatium. Tempus.

1:08:48.207 --> 1:08:51.370
And what happens
if I pick the wrong one?

1:08:51.544 --> 1:08:54.411
Well, then your piece
stays inside the tower

1:08:54.589 --> 1:08:58.298
and you suffer the same fate as mamba.

1:08:58.468 --> 1:08:59.958
Skinned alive.

1:09:07.018 --> 1:09:10.010
“They do evil to whom evil is done.

1:09:10.188 --> 1:09:12.850
“The idol will help you ask the right one.

1:09:13.024 --> 1:09:16.187
“Try not to see with,
but through, the eyes.

1:09:16.361 --> 1:09:19.023
“One tells the truth, the other one lies.”

1:09:19.197 --> 1:09:23.941
You go through all this and
it comes down to some bullshit guess.

1:09:24.118 --> 1:09:26.450
It's a 50-50 chance.

1:09:35.672 --> 1:09:37.162
I think I got it.

1:09:37.340 --> 1:09:38.921
Tell me.

1:09:41.844 --> 1:09:44.460
If the one I ask is the one
that always tells the truth,

1:09:44.639 --> 1:09:47.972
it will truthfully tell me
what the liar would say, yeah?

1:09:48.142 --> 1:09:51.430
Yeah. Ok.

1:09:51.604 --> 1:09:53.390
And then if I ask the one that lies,

1:09:53.564 --> 1:09:56.460
he'll lie about what the truthful one would
say, which will also be a lie.

1:09:56.484 --> 1:09:59.567
See, either way, I just do the opposite.

1:10:01.030 --> 1:10:03.487
That's genius. Alright.

1:10:11.207 --> 1:10:13.573
I feel ridiculous asking
one of these things a question.

1:10:13.751 --> 1:10:18.040
It's not ridiculous.
Everything depends on it.

1:10:21.759 --> 1:10:25.251
What would the other idol say
I should choose?

1:10:27.890 --> 1:10:29.471
Space or time?

1:10:49.162 --> 1:10:51.153
Space.

1:10:51.330 --> 1:10:53.696
So, then, I pick time, yeah?

1:10:54.709 --> 1:10:56.245
Go ahead. Make your wish.

1:10:56.419 --> 1:11:01.083
Just choose your words carefully
because... we only got one chance.

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:21.016
Alright, I wish it was a week ago
and we had never played this game.

1:11:26.657 --> 1:11:29.444
I wish that everything that's happened
would be undone.

1:12:01.484 --> 1:12:03.440
Tomas, what's up? Listen to me.

1:12:03.611 --> 1:12:08.696
I'm with the cop. I need your help, man.
This is the deal, ok?

1:12:08.866 --> 1:12:12.029
He's gonna trade me my life
for the game.

1:12:12.203 --> 1:12:14.159
What, your life? Where are you?

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:16.537
I'm in my own fucking grave, man.
What?

1:12:16.707 --> 1:12:18.868
Dude, you gotta calm down!

1:12:19.043 --> 1:12:20.408
You need to get here.

1:12:20.586 --> 1:12:21.951
Give me that.

1:12:22.129 --> 1:12:25.496
You want to see your friend alive,
you give me that goddamn game.

1:12:25.675 --> 1:12:27.236
Alright, I'll just... I'll bring the game.

1:12:27.260 --> 1:12:29.296
You got to tell me...
You got to tell me where.

1:12:29.470 --> 1:12:31.426
At your friend's place.

1:12:31.597 --> 1:12:33.758
Now, you be there.

1:12:33.933 --> 1:12:35.889
Or your friend will be
food for the worms.

1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:37.721
Arggh!

1:12:41.691 --> 1:12:43.602
Jason: Tomas.

1:12:44.861 --> 1:12:46.397
Tomas!

1:12:50.366 --> 1:12:51.902
Is this what your card said?

1:12:59.083 --> 1:13:01.790
Jason, what happened?
I heard shots. I think he shot him.

1:13:01.961 --> 1:13:03.246
What?

1:13:03.421 --> 1:13:05.707
Shit.

1:13:16.726 --> 1:13:18.216
Did it work?

1:14:04.857 --> 1:14:06.722
Didn't work. Everything's still the same.

1:14:06.901 --> 1:14:08.857
They're all still dead.

1:14:30.841 --> 1:14:32.377
I think I know what's happening.

1:14:32.551 --> 1:14:36.043
The wish won't come true
until the game is over.

1:14:39.058 --> 1:14:41.036
What are you talking about?
The game's already over.

1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:43.426
Not until it takes me.

1:14:43.604 --> 1:14:45.515
Just like it took the others.

1:14:45.690 --> 1:14:47.021
Huh?

1:14:47.191 --> 1:14:50.354
Everyone died in the order that
they were eliminated from the game,

1:14:50.528 --> 1:14:51.813
and I'm next.

1:14:51.988 --> 1:14:54.445
Then the wish will come true.
No. That's impossible.

1:14:54.615 --> 1:14:56.697
This is finished, right?

1:14:56.867 --> 1:14:58.198
No, it's not.

1:14:58.369 --> 1:15:00.030
Think about it.

1:15:00.997 --> 1:15:04.581
I played. And I lost.

1:15:30.526 --> 1:15:32.608
Somebody should have done that
a long time ago.

1:16:34.965 --> 1:16:37.331
Erica.

1:16:38.427 --> 1:16:39.917
Erica!

1:17:24.473 --> 1:17:26.555
Lizar: Hey, I'll take that.

1:17:29.645 --> 1:17:32.011
Go ahead. You deserve it.

1:17:32.189 --> 1:17:35.147
Where's your girlfriend?

1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:39.981
Hold it.

1:17:41.532 --> 1:17:44.274
She's gone, like everybody else,

1:17:44.451 --> 1:17:46.407
and like you're gonna be
when you play that game.

1:17:46.579 --> 1:17:48.820
Hold it, kid.
Is this worth it, huh?

1:17:48.998 --> 1:17:52.240
Was it worth the life
of my friend?! Was it?!

1:17:52.418 --> 1:17:54.750
This is a personal matter.

1:17:56.046 --> 1:17:58.082
Things have to be as they were.

1:17:58.257 --> 1:18:01.590
I had a life that was taken from me.

1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:04.593
That's worth killing for, isn't it?

1:18:06.473 --> 1:18:08.179
Come on. Come on.

1:18:08.350 --> 1:18:10.181
Do it. Do it.

1:18:10.352 --> 1:18:11.808
Is that how you want it?

1:18:11.979 --> 1:18:13.515
Do it.

1:18:13.689 --> 1:18:15.520
Do it. Go ahead.

1:18:15.691 --> 1:18:17.352
Do it! That the way you want it?

1:18:17.526 --> 1:18:19.312
Yeah! Have it your way!

1:19:39.525 --> 1:19:41.061
Who are you?

1:19:41.235 --> 1:19:46.355
You do believe in witches, don't you?

1:19:48.033 --> 1:19:50.615
I'm here to Grant your wish.

1:19:50.786 --> 1:19:54.995
You can have anything you want.

1:19:57.209 --> 1:19:58.699
But I already made my wish.

1:19:58.877 --> 1:20:01.368
It seems a waste.

1:20:01.547 --> 1:20:07.292
If I Grant you that,
you'll be right back to where you started.

1:20:07.469 --> 1:20:10.085
No better.

1:20:10.264 --> 1:20:12.129
But my friends will be alive, right?

1:20:12.308 --> 1:20:14.264
They will.

1:20:14.435 --> 1:20:16.300
Why think of them?

1:20:17.688 --> 1:20:21.272
They wouldn't waste
this opportunity for you.

1:20:21.442 --> 1:20:23.854
No. No. I... I. I.

1:20:24.028 --> 1:20:26.019
I made my wish.

1:20:26.196 --> 1:20:29.313
I wish it was a week ago
and I never played this game.

1:20:29.491 --> 1:20:30.981
I wanna undo everything.

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:35.199
Out of the pit that lives in me,

1:20:35.372 --> 1:20:40.537
your heart's desire, so mote it be.

1:20:42.254 --> 1:20:43.835
Vae victis.

1:21:45.859 --> 1:21:47.224
What's up?

1:21:47.403 --> 1:21:49.394
Nothing. Let's go.

1:22:09.842 --> 1:22:13.334
I'm not... I'm sorry.
Yeah. I'm... I'm disgusting?

1:22:14.471 --> 1:22:15.756
You enjoyed that. Oh, come.

1:22:15.931 --> 1:22:17.546
This is the cutest thing. Look.

1:22:17.724 --> 1:22:19.339
So over-the-top.

1:22:19.518 --> 1:22:20.803
Lisa: I want a pair.

1:22:20.978 --> 1:22:22.338
Tomas: Like you don't have enough.

1:22:22.479 --> 1:22:23.719
How much are these?

1:22:23.897 --> 1:22:26.730
Man: 15. But for you, 10.

1:22:39.621 --> 1:22:43.990
Frickin' weird guy that owns
the shop back there gave it to me.

1:22:44.168 --> 1:22:48.411
This is an antique. The guy said it came
from the Spanish inquisition.

1:22:48.589 --> 1:22:51.251
Alright, alright, alright.
Come on. Here we go.

1:22:52.926 --> 1:22:55.713
So everybody knows who they are,
they know what they are.

1:22:55.888 --> 1:22:59.301
Um, in the game, we're not so much
playing against each other

1:22:59.475 --> 1:23:01.090
as we are playing
against the game, ok?

1:23:01.268 --> 1:23:04.931
So it's a lot like craps.
It's like Blackjack, what have you.

1:23:05.189 --> 1:23:08.022
Everybody could win.
Everybody could lose.

1:23:10.194 --> 1:23:14.813
Tomas: Ok, I'm first.
