Ghost Leader to Raven, do you copy?

02:47.125 --> 02:49.836
Yeah, I copy, Ghost Leader.
I got diddly-squat.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.298
This is Condor, I got nada.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.846
It doesn't make sense.
The last experience was right here.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.100
This is where the readings
go way off the chart.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.521
I told you there was no ghosts down here.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.859
You sure this piece of junk
you built even works?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.611
Yeah, you were there when I tested it.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.905
Cut the chatter.
I think I got something.

03:17.071 --> 03:17.906
What is it?

03:17.989 --> 03:19.324
Yeah, I definitely got something.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.576
Ha. Told you it works.
Jay-Bird's got something.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.995
<i>And it's moving fast.</i>

03:24.662 --> 03:28.041
Raven, Condor, follow my signal
and get ready to activate the trap.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.378
- You think it's in a physical form?
- I'm not taking any chances.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.131
I'm gonna ready the camera.
We're finally gonna get some proof.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.968
- It's not gonna work.
- Trust me, it's gonna work.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.803
Man, I hope this works.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.724
Showtime. Activate the trap!

03:59.614 --> 04:02.450
Mom. You're home.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.079
Wow. It works.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.789
Yikes!

04:08.623 --> 04:10.250
Sorry, Mrs. C. Let me help you with that.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.835
Thank you. Yes, I'm home.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.796
I came home 'cause I thought
I was gonna surprise you guys

04:14.879 --> 04:18.800
with a homemade meal
instead of takeout all the time.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.928
Hi, guys. You guys can stay, too,
if you want.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.680
Even though you shot me
with your net cannon.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.100
Thanks, but I'd better get back.
Homework and stuff.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.394
Plus, it's pineapple pizza night
at my dad's.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.729
Yeah, I gotta hit the books, too.
Thanks, anyway.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.439
- See ya in school, Danny.
- Bye, guys.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.565
See you later, guys.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.859
Can we have mashed potatoes, Mommy?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.445
Um, yes, we can have mashed potatoes.
I already made them.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.864
But what's going on?
What is all this stuff?

04:42.073 --> 04:44.033
Just some paranormal tracking gear
I put together.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.245
- Contact spirits and stuff.
- Ghosts, Mommy.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.747
Danny's building a machine
so we can talk to Daddy.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.458
No, she's a liar.
Big liar. No, no, no, no.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.044
It's something for science. And school.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.717
I know this could be
a really tough Christmas for us.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.804
But I want you to know that I'm doing
my best to make it special, okay?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.056
I know that's what
Daddy would have wanted.

05:08.016 --> 05:11.227
And I also know that Daddy would have
wanted you to have mashed potatoes

05:11.311 --> 05:15.523
and pork chops, so get your tiny butts
upstairs. Hop to!

05:34.917 --> 05:36.335
- Red?
- No.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.005
Yeah, come on.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.301
- Black?
- No.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.099
- Black again.
- No!

05:53.936 --> 05:54.937
Let me see this thing.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.484
Ow! Watch the ears, man.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.526
Sorry.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.032
- Zoom in on that.
- This thing's a piece of crap.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.202
I mean, statistically, you should,
at least, have half of these right.

06:09.744 --> 06:10.620
So how am I doing?

06:11.913 --> 06:14.207
13%, Matt. Thirteen.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.210
I have a better shot at guessing
your blood type right now

06:17.293 --> 06:18.836
than you do guessing half of these cards.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.339
Does this mean Mr. Rounds
is gonna fail your paper?

06:21.923 --> 06:24.008
I doubt it. This is for my own studies.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.761
It's on psychokinetic abilities
in early teens.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.554
I finished the paper days ago.

06:28.805 --> 06:29.889
Well, that's a relief.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.266
The pressure was really on me there,
for a minute.

06:32.850 --> 06:33.684
Don't worry about it.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.144
I'm getting used to this whole

06:35.311 --> 06:37.063
different teachers,
different classes thing,

06:37.563 --> 06:40.650
and I got a surefire A-plus right here.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.987
Let's see what
Professor Nerdly's working on this week.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.782
- Dude, just give it back.
- Give it back or what?

06:47.907 --> 06:50.243
Careful Rodge. His daddy
might come back and haunt you.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.247
Hey, man, that's not even funny.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.376
I'm laughing.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.549
You better not be filming this
to put me on bully prevention.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.592
'Course not, Roger. You know I'm cool.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.720
Just give it back.
You don't even know how to read.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.305
- What was that?
- Nothing.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.725
Saved by the bell.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.477
Looks pretty good,

07:16.644 --> 07:17.979
you might wanna clean it up a little bit.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.109
Make sure to say hi
to that hot mom of yours, Danny boy.

07:28.948 --> 07:32.243
I gotta go all the way
to the E-Building. I gotta go.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.878
Oh, great.

07:48.759 --> 07:49.635
Don't sweat it, man.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.555
There's one of those guys
at every school I've ever been to.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.390
Thanks.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.642
I gotta go. See you tonight?

07:56.934 --> 07:58.895
Now, that I could have predicted.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.442
Where's my works cited page?

08:05.026 --> 08:07.904
Come on. Oh, no. I'm gonna flunk.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.118
- Daniel Chase?
- How do you know my name?

08:14.994 --> 08:16.245
Says so right here.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.625
My works cited paper! Thank you.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.544
Well, I found it
when I took out the trash.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.297
Oh... Uh, thanks...

08:27.089 --> 08:30.760
- Rick.
- Well, see you around, Rick.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.304
Oh, yeah. Anytime.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.619
Hello?

08:57.662 --> 09:01.332
No, I know it. I still have to do
all my Christmas shopping,

09:01.499 --> 09:03.834
go to my mother's,
go food-shopping with her,

09:03.918 --> 09:07.004
and then bake all stinkin' day long
after that. I just can't.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.091
Anyway, your hair looks fabulous.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.884
I got, like, six million Christmas cards
to send out.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.010
My ex sends me flowers.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.428
But I'm like, "Yeah, no, bye."

09:14.512 --> 09:16.430
But I guess the decent thing to do
would be to send a text,

09:16.514 --> 09:19.433
you know, "Merry Christmas, I hope
your life is terrible without me."

09:20.101 --> 09:23.646
But anyway, let's get this foil
done and done, girl. Right? Mmm-hmm.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.692
These kids. They don't even believe
in Santa. It's not fun anymore.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.944
All they do is complain.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.114
It's like they expect to win
the lottery every 25th of December.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.784
Yeah, I know. It's something else,
right? I mean, my kids still believe.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.704
I'm trying to keep them old-fashioned,

09:39.912 --> 09:41.581
but they don't want to go shopping
anymore.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.542
They just wanna get on the computer,
add to cart,

09:44.625 --> 09:47.837
and then have it delivered to our house.
And we gotta pay for it.

09:47.962 --> 09:51.299
Well, that's what husbands are for.
I mean, am I right?

10:06.105 --> 10:09.066
Look how cute he is!
I can't, I can't!

10:09.150 --> 10:11.027
What a perfect little man.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.194
Well, thank you.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.281
Hi. Oh, I love him.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.116
Oh, you're referring to Pretzel.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.535
Well, don't let the cute act fool you.

10:19.869 --> 10:23.247
Underneath all that fur
is one very lazy business associate.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.543
Hi. Aw, cute dog.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.173
I'm Sammy. I'm your 6:00.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.677
- Oh. You're Sammy?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.679
- Oh.
- I booked the appointment online.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.016
Which, I have to admit, was quite helpful.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.561
Um... Maybe I should have specified.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.064
You do cut men's hair, don't you?

10:48.314 --> 10:51.400
Of course. Yes. Um...

10:51.817 --> 10:54.320
- Susan, sorry, it's 6:00.
- Oh, but no.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.780
- We're done.
- No, but really...

10:55.946 --> 10:58.074
It looks great, honey. Remember new wave?

10:58.157 --> 11:00.618
- The '80s? You look so hot.
- Oh, okay.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.495
- See you next year.
- I still have these--

11:02.578 --> 11:04.955
- There you go. Here's your purse. Bye.
- Put these in a little--

11:05.831 --> 11:07.291
Have a seat. Yeah.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.085
Behave, Pretzel.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.258
Did you break up with your barber
or something?

11:16.884 --> 11:20.846
Oh. No, I'm not dating my barber.

11:21.222 --> 11:24.809
- No, I mean...
- No, I'm new in town.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.728
I just moved here for work.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.816
My first day is Monday,
so I wanted to look sharp, you know?

11:32.274 --> 11:34.443
- Show 'em that I mean business.
- Wow.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.322
- What do you do?
- Norepole Toy Company.

11:39.698 --> 11:43.494
I do a lot of marketing,
corporate branding, social media.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.791
Lots of high-tech stuff that I'm not
really at liberty to talk about.

11:49.583 --> 11:53.963
Well, um, my people already left
so, you can just pay me if you want, $25.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.674
Oh, right. That's right,
the whole money thing.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.346
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.141
All right.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.185
Good evening. I mean, good day.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.146
Yes, my jacket...

12:10.938 --> 12:11.772
Nice meeting you.
Pretzel.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.118
Wrestling's on.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.205
Max Miracle takes on Livewire
in a cage match.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.457
Max Miracle's gonna kick his butt.

13:11.832 --> 13:15.002
He's gonna do
the Miracle Maker on him. Like this!

13:19.757 --> 13:21.300
Guys, it's on.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.886
<i>All right, fans, in ten short days,</i>

13:23.969 --> 13:26.680
<i>the XWA is coming to your hometown.</i>

13:26.931 --> 13:29.558
<i>That's right, we invade Norepole, Maine,</i>

13:29.767 --> 13:32.895
<i>for the 15th annual Gingerbread Brawl.</i>

13:33.312 --> 13:37.107
<i>On that night, Max Miracle
will defend his title</i>

13:37.316 --> 13:42.196
<i>against his arch nemesis,
the undefeated Tucker Von Magnus</i>

13:42.530 --> 13:45.407
<i>and his evil manager, DG Haven.</i>

13:45.699 --> 13:48.827
<i>It'll be a no-disqualification
Handicap Match,</i>

13:48.911 --> 13:50.538
<i>something you don't wanna miss.</i>

13:50.663 --> 13:52.581
<i>Folks, make sure you call right now</i>

13:52.665 --> 13:55.626
<i>and get your tickets, 'cause the action is coming your way.</i>
I already got my mine. My dad surprised me with them last night,

13:59.672 --> 14:02.424
'cause I got a B in math...

14:04.260 --> 14:05.678
Well, I'm sure we'll get ours soon.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.139
I wouldn't count on it. We don't have
a lot of extra money anymore,

14:09.223 --> 14:11.225
and Mom says those tickets are expensive.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.853
It's not that. My mom's just been working
a lot lately.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.605
Probably hasn't gotten the time
to buy 'em.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.732
It is a busy time of year.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.375
So, what do you think, Pretzel?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.795
You know what? I can't even believe
you said that.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.757
This is definitely
bigger than our last office.

14:44.341 --> 14:47.177
Okay, you know what?
Hold all my calls, all right?

14:47.344 --> 14:49.054
I'm gonna get some real work done.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.561
- Enjoying your new digs?
- Ah. Yes, sir.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.147
Yes, sir, thank you. It most, uh,

14:58.480 --> 15:00.524
definitely has enough space.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.568
- Ah. Sit down, sit down.
- Yes, sir.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.821
I just came in to welcome you aboard.

15:06.864 --> 15:07.823
Well, thank you, sir.

15:08.824 --> 15:12.995
- Hello there, young man.
- Oh, and I wanted to thank you

15:13.078 --> 15:15.956
for allowing me
to bring my assistant as well.

15:16.707 --> 15:20.836
Hey, hey. Pretzel's your little helper.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.714
Just as you're my little helper.

15:23.964 --> 15:29.011
Boy. I sure am excited to go to work
for such an iconic guy.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.221
I mean, um, "company."

15:31.722 --> 15:34.975
Well, the Norepole Toy Company's

15:35.059 --> 15:38.270
been around for a long, long while.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.147
I'll say.

15:40.397 --> 15:43.817
And I'm glad that you're here
to help me make it go on

15:44.193 --> 15:46.779
for a lot longer while.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.280
Well, fear not, sir,

15:48.364 --> 15:51.617
because you have definitely hired
the right guy for the job.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.994
See you around, pal.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.831
- Uh, thank you, sir.
- You betcha.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.794
- You betcha.
- Oh, this is not gonna be easy.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.880
Oh, shut up, Pretzel.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.606
Did you make your Christmas list yet?

16:23.440 --> 16:24.483
Not yet.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.366
- What's with the box?
- It's for class tomorrow.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.370
What is it?

16:37.579 --> 16:39.164
It's our end-of-semester project.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.501
We're supposed to do one thing we wish
we could have for Christmas,

16:42.918 --> 16:44.378
so, I did a memory box.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.050
Gotcha. What's in it?

16:51.927 --> 16:53.220
Things I have from Dad.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.181
Things he gave me, you know,
when he was alive.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.937
- Can I have a look?
- Sure.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.069
Wow. You've got a lot in here.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.156
Yep. Pretty much everything I have.

17:13.531 --> 17:14.532
Yeah.

17:17.493 --> 17:20.372
So... Better start making
your Christmas list,

17:20.539 --> 17:23.500
because Santa's coming soon.

17:23.751 --> 17:24.960
Santa's not real, Danny.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.923
What are you talking about?
Of course he's real.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.592
No, he isn't.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.844
Stop saying that. Why wouldn't he be real?

17:34.178 --> 17:37.181
Because this world isn't good enough
for a Santa Claus.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.307
He'd have no one to visit.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.728
Look, I know
this is our first Christmas without Dad,

17:42.811 --> 17:43.854
but we have to make the best of it.
It's what he would've wanted.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.899
And, you know what he always said,

17:47.983 --> 17:50.152
- "Incredible things happen--"
- "To those who believe."

17:50.235 --> 17:51.445
Exactly.
Danny, do you really think

17:53.947 --> 17:56.617
there could be something as good
as a Santa Claus in this world?

17:58.994 --> 18:01.330
You know, just because
bad things happened to us

18:01.413 --> 18:02.998
doesn't mean good things don't exist.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.086
Hey, guys. Wanna help me trim the tree?

18:07.211 --> 18:09.213
I should really finish my homework.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.716
What? Jennifer.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.470
Oh, look, that one that we made,

18:16.553 --> 18:19.640
the little nest with the bird egg?
Remember when Jen and I made that?

18:20.307 --> 18:23.185
And... Oh! Here's one
that Aunt Jo gave you.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.230
- The...
- Okay, fine.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.774
That's my girl.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.277
Okay, so you guys carry this box in,

18:32.778 --> 18:36.198
and this tin,
and I will go get the lights.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.366
Yep.

So, did you talk to Jenny
about the Secret Santa thing?

19:31.503 --> 19:33.755
I don't think she's into
all that Christmas stuff this year.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.465
What do you mean?

19:36.216 --> 19:39.553
Last night, she told me
she doesn't even believe in Santa anymore.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.598
Whoa. That's serious.

19:47.477 --> 19:51.231
You look tired, Danny. Up all night
hunting ghosts and werewolves again?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.733
Shut up, Roger.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.819
What's the loser brigade
gonna track down next?

19:56.653 --> 19:58.864
The Tooth Fairy? Maybe the Easter Bunny?

20:00.365 --> 20:01.909
At least what we do is fun.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.620
All you do for fun is mess with people.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.332
You nerds waste your lives

20:08.582 --> 20:11.835
collecting blurry pics
and stories that add up

20:12.169 --> 20:14.379
to a mile-high pile of bull.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.590
What a joke.

20:16.757 --> 20:17.841
Watch out, Roger.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.974
Roger, I think you have it backwards.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.434
The food goes in your mouth.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.820
I'm gonna get you guys back for this.

20:42.991 --> 20:46.370
It was me. I totally pied his butt.
It's funny every time.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.287
Really?

20:47.371 --> 20:49.373
I mean, I was gonna pie someone's butt,

20:49.623 --> 20:52.793
and after he tossed your stuff
the other day, he totally deserved it.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.420
I say, due to the fact

20:55.504 --> 20:57.839
that that jerk just got his butt pied
in front of the whole class,

20:58.882 --> 21:01.843
I think we should celebrate
and get ourselves into the holiday spirit.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.106
and a vintage R2-D2 alarm clock.
How about you?

23:19.856 --> 23:21.942
A new Xbox, obviously some games.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.528
Hopefully, I'll get <i>Thunderbolt X2.</i>

23:25.070 --> 23:27.405
And a fly new pair of kicks.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.991
You guy's really still believe
in that Santa stuff, huh?

23:30.826 --> 23:33.286
- Uh, yeah, why wouldn't we?
- I don't know, man.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.205
We're in middle school. Isn't it over?

23:35.413 --> 23:38.500
Isn't that just some dumb story
to keep little babies in line?

23:38.750 --> 23:40.919
Santa is real, okay?

23:42.671 --> 23:46.133
My dad believed in him.
And, I believe in him, too.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.477
Hey, make sure
you're not on the naughty list.

23:58.937 --> 23:59.729
Naughty list?

24:05.026 --> 24:06.278
Santa's real, okay?

24:08.113 --> 24:09.990
- What is that?
- Ho, ho, ho, loser.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.745
Hey, man. You didn't happen
to check Facebook yet, have you?

24:16.788 --> 24:20.292
- No, why?
- Oh, it's bad, dude. Look.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.628
<i>Santa is real, okay?</i>

24:24.504 --> 24:26.631
<i>Santa is real, okay?</i>

24:27.465 --> 24:28.550
What the...

24:31.052 --> 24:32.888
It's all over the school's page.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.682
If it isn't Santa's little losers.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.559
Told you I'd get you back.

24:38.768 --> 24:42.022
Guess I'm gonna get
a lump of coal now.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.069
There's only one way that video
could have gotten out.

24:48.361 --> 24:50.697
Yep. Walking this way.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.368
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.037
I was just showing Roger the clip.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.748
We were in homeroom. I was just trying
to be cool, you know?

24:59.831 --> 25:01.750
Hang out with some girls, be popular.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.501
I didn't know he was gonna post it.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.463
I gotta go.

25:07.422 --> 25:08.548
You coming, Jake?

25:09.424 --> 25:11.968
Just so you know, Jake,
you may be popular,

25:12.636 --> 25:14.054
but you'll never be cool.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.058
Come on, Jake. We're waiting.

25:33.615 --> 25:37.285
You know, Pretzel, I just need
your support, for once. Okay?

25:37.577 --> 25:39.663
Do not undermine me when I go in there.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.209
Yeah, I know, I know she's attractive.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.503
Just... Just keep it together, will ya?

25:47.712 --> 25:50.131
Can I have your support
for once, please? Let's go.

25:51.132 --> 25:52.676
What are you talking about?
You ate a full lunch.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.886
This is not a time for food, Pretzel.

26:00.475 --> 26:02.477
Oh, you're such a ladies man.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.148
- Welcome back, boys.
- Pretzel!

26:07.232 --> 26:08.942
Come here, you little snow angel.

26:15.824 --> 26:19.286
Hi. Um... Do you have time for a walk-in?

26:20.120 --> 26:20.954
Um...

26:24.374 --> 26:26.459
- Sure.
- Great.

26:27.711 --> 26:28.545
Pretzel.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.225
All right, but I don't think
your hair's really grown

26:42.309 --> 26:44.060
since I just cut it two days ago.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.608
Okay, you got me.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.446
I'm not here for a haircut.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.740
I'm here on business.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.242
Um, I'm seeking some consultation.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.455
- Really?
- Yes.

27:04.122 --> 27:04.956
Um...

27:06.166 --> 27:08.335
Do you mind
if we go somewhere else to talk?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.837
Just, you know, be a little more private.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.506
You, me, and, uh, Pretzel.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.258
Do you ice skate?

27:16.301 --> 27:19.054
- Ice skate?
- Yes. Blades on shoes,

27:19.137 --> 27:20.930
allows you to glide across the ice...

27:21.014 --> 27:22.307
- I know what--
- ...rather rapidly.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.851
Yes, I can ice skate.
But why can't we just talk about it here? I mean,
what do you need me to consult?

27:28.021 --> 27:28.855
Okay.

27:28.938 --> 27:32.275
I'm not here to creep you out.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.403
And I promise you
that this is not a date thing.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.574
Although, I mean, that's not
the most outlandish of ideas.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.160
This is coming out all wrong.

27:43.953 --> 27:47.123
I'm just here to outsource
some business for you, that's all.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.125
I mean, just think of it as, uh...

27:49.709 --> 27:52.087
Putting a few extra gifts
under the Christmas tree.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.340
- Don't you work at a toy company?
- Yes.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.717
And at the Norepole Toy Company

27:57.801 --> 28:00.720
we take our confidentiality
very seriously.

28:01.137 --> 28:02.430
Come on. What do you say?

28:03.932 --> 28:05.058
And Pretzel's gonna ice skate?

28:06.768 --> 28:07.727
He's a terrible skater.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.565
And only if it's not remotely a date.

28:13.024 --> 28:16.111
I promise you
this is totally a business opportunity.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.031
All right. We'll take separate cars.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.659
I don't have a car.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.374
$25.

28:30.625 --> 28:31.459
Pay up, buddy.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.390
<i>- Ho, ho, ho, loser.
- Santa's real, okay?</i>

28:45.515 --> 28:47.642
<i>- Ho, ho, ho, loser.
- Santa's real, okay?</i>

28:48.184 --> 28:50.520
<i>- Ho, ho, ho, loser.
- Santa's real, okay?</i>

28:50.603 --> 28:52.397
<i>- Ho, ho, ho, loser.

28:53.148 --> 28:53.982
You know what?

28:54.315 --> 28:57.736
I think that piece of trash, Roger,
gave me a pretty good idea.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.071
- What do you mean?
- Look.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.075
What if we could prove Santa's real?

29:05.285 --> 29:07.829
Danny, I'm real sorry
about what happened to you today,

29:07.996 --> 29:10.165
and I know it must have been embarrassing,

29:10.832 --> 29:12.500
but you know how I feel about this.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.462
I mean,
you're all about the scientific method.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.424
Well, Santa defies
every single law of science.

29:19.632 --> 29:22.385
And attitudes like that are exactly
why no one's ever discovered him.

29:22.802 --> 29:24.262
I think Danny's on to something.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.681
We take a real systematic approach.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.184
We're gonna be the first ones
to find Santa Claus.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.143
Yeah.

29:30.351 --> 29:33.271
It's official,
you've both completely lost your minds.

29:33.396 --> 29:36.274
We're talking about jolly,
old St. Nick. Kris Kringle!

29:36.357 --> 29:38.401
- The fat man in the red suit.
- Yeah.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.737
We're talking about proving
that he walks the Earth.

29:41.279 --> 29:44.407
We take the same approach that we took Bigfoot watching and ghost hunting.
Well, we never found a ghost, and the jury's still out on Bigfoot.

29:48.828 --> 29:51.122
- This is different.
- Yeah. Santa's a guy.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.709
We collect eyewitness testimony,
take all photographic evidence

29:54.793 --> 29:56.586
and take any and all leads.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.297
This is historically epic stuff.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.341
But I'm not doing it without you.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.302
What do you say, Jay-Bird?

30:05.094 --> 30:06.304
I say you're crazy.

30:09.307 --> 30:12.101
- So where do we start?
- Time to go postal.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.776
<i>♪ Giddyup! Whoa, Nelly ♪</i>

30:22.445 --> 30:24.239
- I don't get it.
- Me either.

30:24.864 --> 30:28.368
Look, every year, kids write letters
to Santa by the millions, right?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.371
Yeah, how else would he know
what to have the elves make?

30:31.538 --> 30:33.498
- Next.
- Well, have you ever written a letter

30:33.581 --> 30:34.833
and put down the wrong address?

30:35.959 --> 30:38.962
I don't think I've ever written
a letter. Like, ever.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.673
- Next.
- Santa still gets letters.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.552
- Seems like a long shot.
- It's actually the law

30:45.635 --> 30:47.762
that the US Post Office
has to send them back.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.851
Even with a perfectly valid address
written on it.

30:53.768 --> 30:56.563
- Letters to Santa.
- I get it.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.107
- Those letters are going somewhere.
- Exactly.

30:59.357 --> 31:02.861
If we follow the letters, we might
be able to find Santa, and the end.

31:03.361 --> 31:07.031
- Next.
- Hi, um... We were-- Um...

31:07.282 --> 31:12.453
We have a few questions
on, um, a school project.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.915
About... ...letters to Santa.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.835
- You want what?
- Letters to Santa.

31:21.045 --> 31:24.382
I would like to know
how to go about writing a letter to Santa.

31:29.178 --> 31:30.930
I guess you're gonna have to talk
to Carol.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.310
Next.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.895
Hi, ma'am.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.939
My associates and I have a few questions
about the letters to Santa.

31:40.189 --> 31:41.608
Oh, I'm sorry, kids.

31:41.691 --> 31:44.861
But unfortunately,
all that information is classified.

31:45.403 --> 31:46.946
But it's in the name of science.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.073
I've been doing this job
for ten years now.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.951
You think you're the first kids
to try to cut out the middle man

31:52.035 --> 31:53.953
and get a direct line to St. Nick?

31:54.537 --> 31:56.748
Well, I'll tell you now, not gonna happen.

31:57.373 --> 32:00.460
Look, we're not trying to get
any extra presents or sell him anything.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.086
We just want to know if he exists.

32:02.962 --> 32:06.257
Okay. He's real. You can go home now.

32:06.883 --> 32:07.717
We need evidence.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.053
Look, I don't know what to tell you, kid.

32:10.553 --> 32:11.804
Did you think you were gonna come here

32:11.888 --> 32:14.223
and find him in a mailbag
full of fruitcakes?

32:14.807 --> 32:18.269
Look, we just wanna know what happens
to the letters when they leave here.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.440
- Can't you just give us a hint?
- Yeah, can't ya?

32:22.607 --> 32:26.819
- Please? Pretty please?
- Come on, get serious.

32:27.070 --> 32:31.532
If I gave out that address,
then every kid in Norepole would be there.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.455
So it's in Norepole?

32:39.207 --> 32:40.750
Uh, time's up, kids.

32:41.084 --> 32:41.918
Thanks, ma'am.
You have a good day.

32:50.593 --> 32:52.679
Well, we learned
a nice nugget of information today.

32:52.804 --> 32:53.846
It's a great start.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.933
We know all the letters
kids write to Santa are going somewhere.

32:57.433 --> 33:01.854
And we all know they end up here
in Norepole. So what's step two?

33:02.188 --> 33:04.065
We set up interviews
with anybody who believes

33:04.148 --> 33:05.900
they've come in contact with Santa Claus.

33:06.234 --> 33:09.070
Then we scour social media and set up
interviews with anybody

33:09.153 --> 33:10.655
who believes they have a story to tell.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.907
Right. And at the same time,

33:12.991 --> 33:14.701
we have to find out where
all the letters are going.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.494
What are we waiting for?

33:18.663 --> 33:21.457
"Santa is back.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.293
We are three seekers of the truth

33:24.669 --> 33:26.504
for the existence of Santa Claus.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.548
Yes, we believe.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.634
Send us a message
if you want to set up an interview."

33:32.051 --> 33:34.345
- And send. Wait.
- What?

33:34.554 --> 33:36.889
- Santa emoji.
- Oh, good idea.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.185
How long do you think till someone bites?

33:41.394 --> 33:43.521
We'll probably have to set up
an interview over the weekend.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.190
- Whoa.
- Well, how do you like that?

33:46.357 --> 33:47.400
Well, let's see who it is.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.485
We might not be crazy after all.

33:50.987 --> 33:51.821
Another.

33:53.489 --> 33:56.951
- Wow.
- It's like Santa-holics Anonymous.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.668
So you woke up Christmas morning,
and, if I'm correct,

34:05.752 --> 34:07.420
there were bites taken out of the carrot?

34:08.045 --> 34:08.880
Yeah.

34:09.714 --> 34:13.134
That's pretty common, actually.
It doesn't mean a reindeer ate it.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.346
There was also poop.

34:19.014 --> 34:20.683
- Poop?
- Reindeer poop?

34:25.521 --> 34:27.231
Okay, we're done here.

35:52.608 --> 35:55.653
Come on, you really think
they could find the real Santa Claus?

35:55.736 --> 35:57.363
- They could, Jake.
- Think about it.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.407
Just saying it out loud sounds dumb.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.450
Well, what do you think, Roger?

36:03.870 --> 36:05.705
I think that Danny boy is a lot of things.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.000
And stupid ain't one of 'em.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.545
- You think they can find him?
- I think it's worth looking into.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.173
- Think we should follow them?
- No reason not to.

36:15.381 --> 36:18.009
If they're right, we steal
the evidence and take all the credit.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.846
If they're wrong, we mock them until
they can't be seen in public anymore.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.141
That's a win-win situation.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.360
Okay.
So you followed the mail truck around

36:36.444 --> 36:38.404
and it just brought you
to a bunch of regular houses?

36:38.863 --> 36:42.116
Not a Santa letter in sight.
How'd the interviews go?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.993
Uh, we got a few pieces here and there,

36:44.076 --> 36:45.828
but nothing we could make a case out of.

36:46.495 --> 36:48.998
All the responses prove
that there's something there,

36:49.415 --> 36:51.083
and we're not the only ones who think so.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.502
Yeah. Just gonna have to dig deeper.

37:07.767 --> 37:10.228
Look, let's think logically here.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.482
Where was your first experience
with a registered Santa representative?

37:17.777 --> 37:21.447
Mmm-hmm. I hacked
into the Norepole Mall database

37:21.530 --> 37:24.200
and got a list of mall Santas
from the past decade.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.702
- One of them has to know something.
- Hold it.

37:27.119 --> 37:30.665
- Does that say Big John Pelser?
- Uh, yeah. Why?

37:31.415 --> 37:33.376
Big John Pelser was a mall Santa?

37:33.876 --> 37:35.670
If he's on the list,
he donned the red suit.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.257
It's the best lead we've got.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.092
Watch your heads down there.

37:56.148 --> 37:59.402
So, uh, what's this all about again?
Some kind of school project?

38:00.069 --> 38:03.531
Uh, yeah. Um...
End of semester holiday project.

38:03.864 --> 38:06.534
'Cause you would not believe
the stories people tell me.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.578
They'll say anything to meet
these wrestlers and get autographs,

38:09.662 --> 38:10.788
pictures, that kind of stuff.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.916
Well, I barely even know their names.

38:14.333 --> 38:17.920
- Looks a lot bigger on TV.
- That's showbiz, kid.

38:18.754 --> 38:23.426
I think it's awesome.
Oh, my God. It's Matt Taven.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.887
Whoa, man! It is Matt Taven!

38:29.265 --> 38:31.017
Matt Taven just waved at us!

38:33.019 --> 38:35.104
I thought you "hardly knew them."

38:35.896 --> 38:37.773
I've seen the show, like,
one or two times.

38:37.982 --> 38:38.816
Mmm-hmm.

38:40.067 --> 38:41.902
Yeah, they're all here training.

38:43.529 --> 38:46.115
Big show next week. Gingerbread Brawl?

38:46.991 --> 38:47.825
You guys going?

38:48.284 --> 38:50.661
Heck, yeah.
Everyone in town is gonna be there.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.581
I'm hoping to get my tickets soon.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.918
All right. Let's go see John.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.300
All right, guys.

39:05.551 --> 39:06.969
Big John will be with you soon.

39:07.553 --> 39:09.221
Just do me a favor, okay?

39:10.139 --> 39:12.391
Don't go telling your buddies.
You know, last thing I need

39:12.475 --> 39:14.477
is a bunch of middle schoolers
running around here, all right?

39:14.560 --> 39:15.561
No, don't worry. Don't worry.

39:16.562 --> 39:17.897
- Cool?
- Thanks for all your help.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.815
- Hey, no problem. See you soon. Huh?
- Yeah.

39:24.278 --> 39:26.364
- Aw, man!
- What?

39:27.198 --> 39:29.492
- No dice.
- What do you mean, no dice?

39:29.950 --> 39:31.577
His lockbox, it won't open.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.290
Don't go digging through his lockbox.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.293
- You could get us in trouble.
- Relax, I can't. It's locked.

39:40.753 --> 39:41.796
You're gonna get us thrown out of here.
Uh, guys?

39:45.591 --> 39:46.967
Take a look at that.

39:49.845 --> 39:51.097
Pretty great suit, huh?

39:51.639 --> 39:53.974
The elves made that for me.

39:54.141 --> 39:55.768
Mrs. Claus did the stitching.

39:57.144 --> 39:59.438
Well, yeah, it looks pretty real.

40:00.106 --> 40:03.359
Have a seat.
Look, I'll help you out any way I can.

40:03.442 --> 40:06.153
But no free tickets, no complimentary passes.
We're doing a school project on...

40:10.199 --> 40:12.701
- Our former mall Santas.
- Oh, really?

40:12.785 --> 40:15.746
Yeah, we were going down the list
and we happened to see your name.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.959
Well, I'm pretty busy getting ready
for the Gingerbread Brawl.

40:20.251 --> 40:24.046
But, uh, I'm sure you kids are busy, too.
I'll get you a couple of posters,

40:24.130 --> 40:25.214
maybe a bumper sticker.

40:26.048 --> 40:29.176
You see, we're just so fascinated
with the art form.

40:29.677 --> 40:30.511
Art form?

40:31.387 --> 40:34.223
Well, sure.
Becoming such an ionic character.

40:34.306 --> 40:36.725
It takes a special kind of person
who wishes to bring

40:36.809 --> 40:39.687
that much joy to kids' faces
every December.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.273
You said a mouthful.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.734
Although, it's a lot harder
than people think. You know?

40:46.569 --> 40:48.112
You gotta really believe,

40:48.988 --> 40:52.825
with everything that you got.
Just believe.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.411
And then you drop into the zone.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.538
And everybody believes.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.250
When the little kids smile,
everybody smiles.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.420
And they laugh, they gasp.

41:05.379 --> 41:07.298
There's the magic. Huh?

41:08.257 --> 41:10.634
I didn't want that just once a year.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.636
I love that feeling.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.431
That's why
I got into the wrestling business.

41:19.351 --> 41:22.396
Um, we just wanted to know
how it all works.

41:22.813 --> 41:26.567
- What do you mean?
- Like, were you the regional director

41:26.650 --> 41:31.530
for all the mall Santas?
Or just for the ones in this town?

41:31.989 --> 41:36.785
Also, with the Christmas lists,
did you deliver them to Santa directly?

41:37.203 --> 41:39.246
Me? No, no, no, no.

41:40.372 --> 41:42.708
But didn't you work for the real Santa?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.084
Well, that's complicated.

41:44.793 --> 41:47.046
Well un-complicate it for us then.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.966
Well, we would compile all of the lists,

41:51.050 --> 41:53.761
and we'd send them
to the Norepole Toy Company.

41:54.678 --> 41:55.930
Why would you send them there?

41:57.306 --> 41:58.599
Directly to the manufacturer.

42:02.811 --> 42:03.687
We got our answer.

42:04.563 --> 42:05.981
What do you mean we have our answer?

42:06.732 --> 42:07.691
If the lists go there,

42:07.816 --> 42:09.985
then there's no reason
that the letters don't go there, too.

42:10.444 --> 42:11.779
That's our biggest clue yet.

42:12.571 --> 42:15.699
Well, thanks for all the help, Big John.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.660
- Don't mention it.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

42:17.993 --> 42:19.954
- Okay, kids.
- Merry Christmas.

42:20.120 --> 42:20.955
Good luck.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.129
Ho, ho, ho!

42:29.922 --> 42:33.008
Merry Christmas!

42:48.607 --> 42:50.109
What are you laughing at?

42:51.068 --> 42:52.861
- You're funny.
- Why?

42:53.153 --> 42:55.531
You brought me to skate,
but you don't really skate?

42:56.991 --> 42:58.409
Well, I'll have you know,
where I come from,

42:58.492 --> 43:01.662
I'm actually a championship snowshoer.

43:01.787 --> 43:04.540
- Oh, right. Very much the same thing.
- Yes.

43:04.957 --> 43:06.083
Very dangerous, actually.

43:07.334 --> 43:11.130
So, what I wanna ask you is,
are you a big fan of Christmas?

43:11.380 --> 43:13.215
Or are you
one of those types of people that

43:13.507 --> 43:15.426
try to get it over with
as soon as possible?

43:16.260 --> 43:17.261
Well, I...

43:19.763 --> 43:21.765
- Hmm?
- I don't know, it's different now.

43:23.684 --> 43:24.810
- Why?
- Because...

43:26.687 --> 43:28.647
I lost my husband not very long ago.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.149
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

43:31.108 --> 43:32.693
Elizabeth, I'm so sorry.

43:33.652 --> 43:35.029
This is our first Christmas without him.

43:36.196 --> 43:38.324
That's gotta be really tough on the kids.

43:38.616 --> 43:42.620
Well, Danny, my son, he's like
the little man of the house now.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.705
- Mmm-hmm.
- And he looks after his sister.

43:44.788 --> 43:45.831
He's really strong for her.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.750
That's good. Good man.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.377
But my daughter, Jennifer, she's...

43:50.586 --> 43:52.296
She's kind of lost her Christmas spirit.

43:52.546 --> 43:54.965
She's kind of skeptical
that there is even a Santa.

43:55.215 --> 43:58.302
That's a shame, because that takes
all the magic out of everything.

43:58.385 --> 44:00.179
Santa is a really fun guy.

44:00.888 --> 44:02.681
You know, my husband used to say,

44:02.765 --> 44:04.892
"Incredible things happen
to those who believe."

44:05.351 --> 44:06.602
That's a great motto to live by.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.648
Sounds like, uh,
your husband was a believer.

44:11.857 --> 44:12.691
He was.

44:13.776 --> 44:17.196
So, what's all this top secret stuff
you have to talk to me about?

44:17.488 --> 44:19.365
What if I told you that I work for one

44:19.448 --> 44:25.079
very high-profile client who is quite
entrenched in the Christmas space?

44:25.162 --> 44:26.622
I would say, "Good for you."

44:26.747 --> 44:30.959
You know, um, the kind of client
that works one night a year.

44:32.461 --> 44:36.882
Kind of client whose big night
is coming up very soon.

44:38.050 --> 44:40.719
- Santa?
- Yeah.

44:41.011 --> 44:42.930
Actually, that's the guy.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.391
So you work for the guy at the mall?

44:46.100 --> 44:48.102
No, no, no. No. Not at all.

44:48.644 --> 44:49.728
We're talking about the real Santa.

44:49.812 --> 44:50.854
Oh, well, that makes sense,

44:50.938 --> 44:53.190
because I actually am a silent partner

44:53.273 --> 44:55.567
at the salon with the Tooth Fairy, so...

44:56.276 --> 44:58.695
Elizabeth, stop for a second.

44:59.696 --> 45:00.531
Sorry.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.658
I'm not joking.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.661
Santa Claus is a very real thing.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.580
- There's a real Santa Claus?
- That's correct.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.916
- And you work for him?
- Sure as sugar.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.961
This the part
where I skate on out of here.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.963
I can't believe you.

45:16.797 --> 45:17.965
Gosh, this guy.

45:20.217 --> 45:21.051
Elizabeth...
Elizabeth.

45:35.774 --> 45:36.900
You wanna call me crazy?
Where are we right now?

45:39.945 --> 45:41.655
- The skating rink?
- No, no, no.

45:41.780 --> 45:43.991
- I mean, what place?
- Norepole, Maine.

45:44.074 --> 45:47.161
Exactly. We are in the northernmost part
of the United States.

45:47.494 --> 45:49.746
We're not that far off
from the real North Pole.

45:51.123 --> 45:51.957
What?

45:52.040 --> 45:55.043
In the 1920s,
my company had a cross-promotion

45:55.127 --> 45:56.962
with a "very prominent" soda company,

45:57.254 --> 45:59.047
and Santa Claus became bigger than ever.

45:59.506 --> 46:01.175
So we needed to expand.

46:01.967 --> 46:04.803
Norepole is
just another Christmas outpost.

46:07.639 --> 46:11.435
Okay, so Santa's real,
and you work for him.

46:11.810 --> 46:13.353
What does this have to do with me?

46:13.812 --> 46:15.230
I was hired to re-brand the company.

46:15.647 --> 46:19.693
And to reintroduce Santa Claus
to the new global marketplace.

46:20.110 --> 46:23.989
You know, that way, instead of kids' faces
being buried in a smart phone,

46:24.364 --> 46:27.868
they can look up and rediscover
the magic again,

46:28.410 --> 46:29.661
right before their eyes.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.789
I agree with that. I mean,
I think it would take a miracle

46:32.873 --> 46:34.208
to get kids off their phones.

46:35.667 --> 46:36.877
So you came up with this?

46:37.127 --> 46:39.505
Actually, wrote it on
the cover letter of my application.

46:40.297 --> 46:42.716
Wow. Your boss
must have been really pleased.

46:43.133 --> 46:44.426
Well, it got me the job.

46:45.135 --> 46:46.970
But I mean every word of it.

46:47.679 --> 46:50.390
Because I still believe.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.978
Okay, well, what does all this have
to do with me? I don't...

46:57.606 --> 47:02.236
Well, the jolly, old, fat guy
could use a bit of a makeover.

47:03.070 --> 47:03.904
A makeover?

47:04.780 --> 47:07.282
You'd need one, too,
if you were 1,700 years old.

47:09.576 --> 47:10.619
A Santa makeover.

47:14.665 --> 47:19.461
Max Miracle versus
Tucker Von Magnum and DG Haven.

47:19.795 --> 47:22.464
Oh, popping the territory, baby!

47:23.549 --> 47:27.177
Big John's Christmas money-making machine.

47:31.348 --> 47:33.392
XWA, home of the Gingerbread Brawl.

47:33.809 --> 47:35.227
Big John speaking, talk to me.

47:36.061 --> 47:38.188
Oh, Max, I was just looking at our--

47:39.022 --> 47:41.066
What? What?

47:41.608 --> 47:43.277
I told you to get rid of that motorcycle.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.820
I knew you'd bust your leg someday,

47:44.903 --> 47:46.029
and look now where we are.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.991
Yeah, I know you didn't mean to do it.

47:49.700 --> 47:53.996
No, but who am I gonna get?
I have all this money invested in--

47:55.247 --> 47:57.249
Yeah, I know. I know
you didn't do it on purpose.

47:58.041 --> 48:00.586
All right. Well... Okay. Yes.

48:00.752 --> 48:03.171
Yes, don't worry.
If the doc says you're okay,

48:03.255 --> 48:05.007
I'll put you in the January Jam.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.343
What? Yeah, I love you, too.

48:09.052 --> 48:10.053
Best to the wife.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.931
And have yourself
a merry little Christmas.

48:13.765 --> 48:15.100
'Cause you just ruined mine.

48:16.602 --> 48:19.563
How can I get a bigger draw
than Max Miracle?

48:20.731 --> 48:22.399
I'm gonna need an actual miracle.

48:26.778 --> 48:28.030
<i>Ready for me, Sammy?</i>

48:30.198 --> 48:31.325
Absolutely, sir.

48:32.284 --> 48:34.911
Are you sure you don't want me
to do this up in your office?

48:35.078 --> 48:38.123
<i>Oh, you know me.
I'm used to making the rounds.</i>

48:38.206 --> 48:40.250
Oh!

48:41.293 --> 48:43.003
You kill me. Um...

48:43.587 --> 48:45.088
Okay, I'll be waiting.

48:47.674 --> 48:48.508
That's him?

48:50.218 --> 48:51.053
That's him.

48:52.095 --> 48:53.430
Gosh. Good luck.

48:54.556 --> 48:55.515
Thank you for doing this.

48:57.267 --> 48:59.478
Well, Sam. Yes.

48:59.686 --> 49:01.188
And you must be Elizabeth.

49:02.147 --> 49:04.900
Sam told me that you were coming in
on the project.

49:05.859 --> 49:08.987
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm, um, I'm Elizabeth.

49:09.321 --> 49:12.532
Elizabeth, yes. Nice.

49:13.492 --> 49:16.036
Okay, Christmas is on the way,

49:16.370 --> 49:17.287
let's get on with it.

49:17.829 --> 49:19.706
Well, let me just start by saying

49:19.915 --> 49:23.085
how grateful I am to share
some of the ideas

49:23.168 --> 49:25.879
that I've wanted to implement
for quite some time.

49:26.088 --> 49:27.381
Look, look, look, look, look.

49:30.008 --> 49:33.553
Everybody knows that business
is in the toilet.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.473
It just ain't the way it used to be.

49:36.848 --> 49:39.851
Well, toilet is, um...

49:40.644 --> 49:42.396
Is actually a great place to start.

49:42.479 --> 49:44.606
And an accurate assessment.

49:44.898 --> 49:46.566
Because, you see...
Rick,

49:46.983 --> 49:50.404
technology molds and shapes everything.

49:50.946 --> 49:55.742
Sure. They all shop online
and nobody believes anymore.

49:56.201 --> 50:00.706
Yes, but what I'm saying is we can
use technology to our advantage,

50:01.081 --> 50:02.666
to get people to believe in us again.

50:02.958 --> 50:07.045
To, uh, put a little faith back
in the brand, if you know what I mean.

50:07.129 --> 50:10.757
Okay, kid. Uh, that's why I hired you.

50:10.882 --> 50:13.510
- What do you got?
- What?

50:14.344 --> 50:16.888
It all started
with a simple online search.

50:17.889 --> 50:20.892
Why? To see what was going on
with our image.

50:21.351 --> 50:23.687
"Well, why would you do that, Sammy?"

50:24.229 --> 50:28.442
To gauge
what the overall perception of us was.

50:29.151 --> 50:29.985
And?

50:31.695 --> 50:32.863
I have to be honest.

50:33.196 --> 50:35.198
At first, things were pretty grim.

50:36.366 --> 50:37.200
Then...

50:39.911 --> 50:40.871
I found this.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.628
Oh...

50:49.504 --> 50:51.798
Ho, ho, ho...

50:56.052 --> 51:00.390
I guess there still are some people
who believe in me.

51:00.807 --> 51:03.143
They're out there.
They're looking for you.

51:06.188 --> 51:08.023
The kids want the real Santa Claus.

51:08.231 --> 51:10.025
Well, I say, "Let's give it to 'em."

51:10.734 --> 51:13.028
Let's make ourselves accessible.

51:14.529 --> 51:15.572
What are you saying,

51:16.490 --> 51:19.367
that I should give up
my identify to the people?

51:19.493 --> 51:21.828
No, no. I mean...

51:23.371 --> 51:24.206
In a way.

51:24.289 --> 51:26.541
But, okay, actually, yes.

51:26.708 --> 51:29.044
But Rick, come on. Just think about it.

51:29.377 --> 51:32.631
Because it's not like you're Batman,
you're Santa Claus.

51:32.839 --> 51:34.508
People actually need you.

51:35.926 --> 51:37.552
Oh, okay.

51:38.345 --> 51:39.554
What do you suggest?

51:39.971 --> 51:41.431
A little bit of re-branding.

51:41.515 --> 51:44.601
And, uh, just a touch of visibility.

51:45.727 --> 51:49.856
Well, I'm not going to say no,

51:50.774 --> 51:53.860
but this is the craziest project
I ever heard of.

51:54.402 --> 51:57.239
Crazy? Maybe. But enough is enough.

51:57.614 --> 51:58.949
And it's time for a change.

51:59.407 --> 52:03.286
I mean, who's to say
that we can't take advantage

52:03.370 --> 52:05.038
of the digital marketing space?

52:05.705 --> 52:06.790
What am I talking about?

52:07.666 --> 52:10.502
One live streaming event.

52:11.294 --> 52:14.381
One time for the big time.
Think about it, Rick.

52:15.006 --> 52:18.426
Hundreds of millions of views,
maybe even billions.

52:18.635 --> 52:22.806
Maybe... The most retweets,
likes and shares of all time.

52:23.390 --> 52:26.393
I mean, the Kardashians
got nothing on you.

52:27.602 --> 52:31.273
- Except for... You know, the...
- Oh. Well, yeah.

52:31.898 --> 52:33.108
Grassroots.

52:33.275 --> 52:34.860
We do it right here in Norepole,

52:34.985 --> 52:36.945
and we get people to believe
from the ground up.

52:39.531 --> 52:40.824
Hmm.

52:42.033 --> 52:43.285
Okay.

52:44.911 --> 52:46.121
I'm in.

52:49.916 --> 52:52.210
- Huh...
- Yeah. Back in the day,

52:52.294 --> 52:54.754
this town was full of magic
at Christmas time.

52:54.921 --> 52:57.007
- I mean, it was so alive.
- Oh...

52:57.215 --> 52:59.134
I say let's get some of that swagger back.

53:00.135 --> 53:03.889
All we really need is a...
Some kind of platform.

53:04.222 --> 53:06.808
- Some kind of town-wide event.
- Mmm-hmm.

53:06.892 --> 53:09.102
- Just like this.
- The Gingerbread Brawl.

53:09.394 --> 53:12.647
- What?
- The Gingerbread Brawl.

53:12.731 --> 53:15.233
It's this tradition
that we have in our town,

53:15.317 --> 53:16.610
and everybody really loves it.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.321
My kids go crazy for it.
It's wrestling, it's really fun.

53:19.487 --> 53:21.489
- That sounds perfect.
- Yeah, well...

53:22.032 --> 53:24.200
We'll put a few smiles on a few faces

53:24.284 --> 53:26.912
and let 'em know that
Santa is back in town.

53:27.537 --> 53:29.456
Okay.

53:31.207 --> 53:33.543
- I'm in. Let's do it.
- Let's do it?

53:34.002 --> 53:36.755
- Well, where do we begin?
- Hold that thought.

53:39.507 --> 53:43.386
We begin a Santa... Makeover!

53:44.137 --> 53:46.890
Ah! Oh.

53:48.808 --> 53:50.894
Oh, no.

53:51.561 --> 53:52.896
You can't be...

53:53.730 --> 53:58.568
How could you perpetrate
such a foul representation of me?

53:59.402 --> 54:01.029
This is you.

54:08.536 --> 54:09.579
Oh!

54:10.914 --> 54:11.706
What?

54:18.088 --> 54:19.881
<i>Voila!</i> What do you think?

54:21.132 --> 54:22.384
I hope you're happy.

54:25.971 --> 54:26.846
Hi-oh.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.432
Cavalry has arrived.

54:30.058 --> 54:32.894
We were thinking, maybe, you know,
the Santa suit's been played.

54:32.978 --> 54:34.771
So how about something more casual?

54:34.980 --> 54:40.151
I suppose some layers
could hide the bowl full of jelly.

54:57.669 --> 55:00.505
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

55:00.964 --> 55:02.007
Not so quick.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.425
- There we go.
- There we go.

55:03.717 --> 55:05.635
You can't be carrying
that big sack with you,

55:05.719 --> 55:07.804
- so we're gonna try...
- What big sack?

55:10.098 --> 55:13.977
I can't carry many... Many...
Many gifts in this bag.

55:17.522 --> 55:18.356
I...

55:28.908 --> 55:30.243
Oh! Oh.

55:31.953 --> 55:32.912
A masterpiece.

55:42.464 --> 55:43.339
No.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.426
This outfit is out.

55:50.930 --> 55:53.224
But the Gingerbread Brawl is in.

55:57.062 --> 55:57.896
We'll take it.

56:08.698 --> 56:10.825
So, what'd you get
on your memory box?

56:11.284 --> 56:12.285
I got an A.

56:12.494 --> 56:14.704
Brought my average up
a whole letter grade.

56:15.246 --> 56:18.500
Mrs. Hopper thought it was a great way
for me to get my feelings out.

56:19.209 --> 56:20.668
Yeah, well, you did a great job on it.

56:26.966 --> 56:29.010
Oh, Danny boy.

56:30.637 --> 56:33.264
- What do you want, Roger?
- I heard about your little project.

56:33.681 --> 56:37.393
Trying to prove Santa exists now?
How pathetic can you get?

56:38.144 --> 56:40.146
Well, we actually got
some pretty good evidence.

56:40.438 --> 56:42.774
- I wouldn't go that far.
- Look at this, Danny.

56:42.899 --> 56:44.776
Even your little sister
thinks you're a loser.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.569
I didn't say that, you jerk!

56:46.986 --> 56:49.239
You know, someday,
someone's gonna be bigger than you,

56:49.531 --> 56:51.407
and they might just decide to bully you!

56:51.825 --> 56:53.618
Pipe down, munchkin. Now, what's this?

56:53.993 --> 56:55.495
All your Santa evidence?

57:00.166 --> 57:01.835
Just put it down.

58:24.334 --> 58:26.711
That kid Roger's been in trouble
before. We deal with him a lot.

58:27.378 --> 58:29.923
Listen, ma'am, I wouldn't say this
in front of you son.

58:30.215 --> 58:32.050
But I'm glad he threw him
a couple of good shots.

58:33.551 --> 58:35.345
Danny seems like a good kid.
Go easy on him.

58:36.221 --> 58:37.388
You have a good holiday, all right?

58:37.472 --> 58:39.057
You too, thank you.

58:42.936 --> 58:45.355
Hey there, Rocky Balboa.

58:46.147 --> 58:47.649
You need something for your paw?

58:51.236 --> 58:52.070
He had it coming.

58:52.612 --> 58:55.448
He got rid of every single memory
that Jennifer had of Dad.

58:55.865 --> 58:58.159
Honey, it's okay. I'm not mad at you.

58:58.576 --> 59:00.411
I don't want you going around
hitting people anymore,

59:00.495 --> 59:04.207
but I kinda like it
that you defended your sister.

59:04.457 --> 59:06.417
I know your dad
would have been really proud.

59:09.504 --> 59:12.298
- It sucks, though.
- I know, honey.

59:12.674 --> 59:13.716
No, you don't know.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.385
All these kinds are talking about

59:15.468 --> 59:17.220
these cool traditions
they have with their dad.

59:17.470 --> 59:19.806
I'm over here hunting down Santa,
coming up empty-handed,

59:20.098 --> 59:21.391
Jenny doesn't even believe,

59:21.558 --> 59:23.309
and I'm starting to second-guess
my whole theory.

59:26.354 --> 59:29.732
Well, I know your dad never gave up
on anything in his whole life.

59:30.024 --> 59:31.943
And I've seen that little lab of yours,

59:32.110 --> 59:33.486
and I know how your mind works.

59:34.028 --> 59:37.490
And I think you're a lot closer
than you know, so don't give up.

59:38.575 --> 59:40.660
Thanks, Mom. How's Jennifer?

59:41.244 --> 59:42.078
She's okay.

59:42.996 --> 59:44.956
She had a lot of irreplaceable things,
you know.

59:45.790 --> 59:48.001
But I had some doubles of the photos,
so that cheered her up.

59:49.085 --> 59:49.919
I have an idea.

59:50.044 --> 59:53.172
How about a little early Christmas gift
so we can lighten the mood?

59:54.007 --> 59:54.841
Oh, yeah?

59:54.924 --> 59:56.342
Yeah. You wanna go look in your stocking?

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:10.898
- We're going?
- We're going!

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:14.152
Gingerbread Brawl! Thank you!

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:16.571
Oh, thank you. I gotta go tell Jen.

01:00:24.245 --> 01:00:25.455
Look what Mom got us.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:31.044
Gingerbread Brawl tickets!
Front-row seats!

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:34.547
Great.

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:36.591
You were all about it the other day.

01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:39.344
Scooch over.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:46.142
Roger is a total waste-oid.
I'm over letting him bother me.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:49.312
Yeah, well, you didn't lose everything Dad ever gave you.
No. But I do know that there's more important things to worry about

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:53.650
than that bonehead.

01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:55.610
Yeah, I guess.

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:58.863
More important things like finding Santa!

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:08.665
Oh. No, Rick tells me
that you guys go way back.

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:13.211
Well, I think the XWA

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:16.381
and our company would make
an excellent cross-promotion.

01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:19.133
I mean, we practically share
the same demographic.

01:01:21.427 --> 01:01:24.806
Okay. Well, Gingerbread Brawl it is.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.308
All right. I'll give Rick the good news,

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.394
and, uh, we'll make it happen.

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.522
You got it. Take care.

01:01:35.983 --> 01:01:37.360
Well, Pretzel,

01:01:38.903 --> 01:01:40.405
we've got our captive audience.

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:44.534
Now we just gotta get the big man
ready for the big night.

01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:54.752
Nice.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.134
This is the Norepole Toy Company.

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:03.386
It's been around as long as the town has.

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:06.806
All of our evidence so far
has directed us right here.

01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:12.061
- So what's the plan?
- We infiltrate Norepole Toys.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.313
You mean, like, break in?

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.649
We get in, we take some photos,

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:19.110
snap a few videos,
get the intel, and we're out.

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:22.155
I don't know, man.
This sounds awfully illegal.

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:26.033
- We're not gonna get caught.
- I think we have the necessary gear

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:28.035
to stay stealthy and out of sight.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.913
Tomorrow night, it's showtime.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:32.415
But we'll miss the Gingerbread Brawl.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:34.083
Don't worry, we won't miss it.

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.420
Let's get jolly.

01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:47.240
Okay. Mom's gonna be working till 5:00,

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.950
so we're gonna have to meet her
at the house.

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:51.953
I told my dad I'm getting a ride
from you guys, so I'm good to go.

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.997
Okay. So that should give us
enough time to get in,

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:56.791
scope the scene, and blast out.

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:58.626
Check it out, Jay-Bird.

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:05.883
Looks like the coast is clear.

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.553
Good. I can hack the security cams
for as long as we want,

01:04:08.719 --> 01:04:12.014
but I can only bypass the alarm
for nine minutes, so we gotta boogie.

01:04:12.306 --> 01:04:14.851
- Okay, let's move in a little further.
- Let's go.

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.735
Not so fast, candy cane.

01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:29.323
Think I'm gonna let you get
all the glory for discovering Santa?

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:35.079
You did all the work. Now I'm cashing in.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.540
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:42.044
If it means I get to be the one
to find Santa, I just might.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.423
You know, you got me in a lot of trouble
with the cops the other night.

01:04:45.923 --> 01:04:48.426
I think I've got the receipt
for those punches, right here.

01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:53.264
You know, for a big guy, you went down
pretty easy when I slugged you.

01:04:53.514 --> 01:04:54.682
How's your face feel?

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.436
Not as bad as this paint ball's gonna feel
when it takes your teeth out.

01:05:32.136 --> 01:05:34.931
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks, man.

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.141
Look, guys, I'm sorry. You were right.

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:41.187
Those guys might be popular,
but they definitely aren't cool.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:43.689
Wanna roll with us?
We're gonna head inside.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:45.983
If you'll take me back, Ghost Leader.

01:05:46.567 --> 01:05:47.610
Welcome back, Condor.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.617
All right, come on.

01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:09.507
Guys, get down. I've got something
coming our way.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.303
That car looks a lot like Mom's car.

01:06:14.428 --> 01:06:16.013
Holy smokes! It's Mom!

01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:20.476
- Mom?
- Danny?

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:23.562
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:24.814
We're looking for Santa.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:26.732
I was just racing home to come get you.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.151
You're supposed to be at home.
We've got to go.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:30.903
- So come on, let's get in the car.
- Come on.

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:37.618
<i>T'was the night before Christmas,
and all through the house,</i>

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.746
<i>not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.</i>
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.420
in hopes that St. Nicholas
would soon be there.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:51.924
Hello, everyone, and welcome to
the 15th annual Gingerbread Brawl.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.176
I'm your host, Tommy Dreamer,

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:57.722
and I'll be calling all the action
from bell to bell, pillar to post.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.600
The stage has been set for what I'm sure

01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:06.063
will be a colossal showdown
for the XWA Heavyweight Championship.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:09.066
We're now going to you, live, backstage,

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.527
with my broadcast colleague, Matt Striker,

01:07:11.777 --> 01:07:15.114
as he is standing next to
Tucker Von Magnus

01:07:15.322 --> 01:07:17.575
- and DG Haven.
- Give me that.

01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:19.493
I'm sick of you, Matt Striker.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:24.206
And another thing that I've had enough
of is Max Miracle ducking my man.

01:07:24.915 --> 01:07:27.334
<i>We all know that you're flat-out scared</i>

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:31.005
<i>of the most dangerous competitor in XWA.</i>

01:07:32.631 --> 01:07:34.425
<i>You can run all you want,</i>

01:07:34.675 --> 01:07:36.761
but sooner or later, you're going to have

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:39.055
to crawl out of that hole
you've been hiding in.

01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:42.141
And when you do, you'll face this man,

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:44.477
because he's right here waiting for you!

01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:49.690
Max Miracle, December 24th,
Gingerbread Brawl!

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:55.863
I'm gonna crush you, and then
I'm gonna grind your bones up

01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:58.532
and use them for salt in my dinner!

01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:03.829
Some very powerful words
from Tucker Von Magnus

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.790
and his manager DG Haven.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.666
Tommy, back to you.

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:19.011
Folks, we're going live to the
XWA-tron with a special announcement

01:08:19.303 --> 01:08:20.386
from Max Miracle.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.183
I love you!

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:27.937
<i>Welcome to the Gingerbread Brawl.</i>

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:30.689
<i>And thank you for spending your holiday</i>

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:34.693
<i>taking in the highest level of
professional wrestling on the planet.</i>

01:08:35.736 --> 01:08:38.363
Now, unfortunately, due to injury,

01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:41.492
I want to tell you how
personally sorry I am

01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:43.953
that I cannot defend the title tonight.

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:59.926
But I will be back to defend my title
at January Jam,

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.720
so you make sure you
pre-order your tickets now.

01:09:05.599 --> 01:09:08.060
- What is this garbage?
- Is this some kind of joke?

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:09.895
<i>Merry Christmas, everybody.</i>

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.944
Idiot. What is this?

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:25.411
This is bad. I got this, I got this.

01:09:30.374 --> 01:09:33.210
People, people, take it easy. Calm down.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:38.256
Calm down, calm down.
We can start the show...

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.511
It's not even diet.

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:51.145
Hit the lights, start the show,
before these animals riot!

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:54.773
Will you listen to that?
It's like a Roman circus out there.

01:09:55.065 --> 01:09:57.568
These people are in a lean
and hungry mood.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.653
They'll be setting things
on fire in a minute.

01:10:12.082 --> 01:10:13.626
What do you mean, he's not coming?

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.630
Ladies and gentleman,

01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:21.217
please welcome our Gingerbread Brawl
guest of honor...

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.638
What is this? Who?

01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:27.389
Coming down that aisle,

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.141
from the great North Pole,

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:32.728
the one, the only,

01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:37.024
Santa Claus!

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.533
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:10:48.118 --> 01:10:49.995
Merry Christmas!

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.318
Hey, come here, you little punk.

01:11:23.195 --> 01:11:24.280
What is this crap?

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.865
How do we know
you're not just some mall Santa phony?

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:31.829
Eh? Oh? Watch this, Roger.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.373
Watch carefully.

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:41.088
You looking? You looking?

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:06.030
It's him! It's really him!

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:20.544
Dad was right the whole time.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:23.255
And you found him, Danny.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:36.769
Whoa.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:21.480
Merry Christmas to every one of you.

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:23.899
This town

01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:29.905
has helped me for so many years,

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:32.616
that I figured

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:36.036
what better place to make

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:42.126
my first official public appearance?

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.420
This time of year

01:13:46.338 --> 01:13:48.340
is about believing.

01:13:49.633 --> 01:13:51.510
Some of you here tonight

01:13:52.302 --> 01:13:57.516
have helped me come
to believe in myself again.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.310
This time of year

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:03.439
is also about giving.

01:14:04.481 --> 01:14:05.482
Giving.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.279
So I'll kick things up a little

01:14:11.488 --> 01:14:15.409
in the hopes that I can give you

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:19.788
a little bit of an early present.

01:14:20.664 --> 01:14:24.376
I know you did not expect to see

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:28.338
your honored guest performer tonight,

01:14:29.923 --> 01:14:31.550
but ladies and gentleman,

01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:38.515
I give you XWA's champion

01:14:40.058 --> 01:14:43.687
Max Miracle!

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:05.918
Well?

01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:11.798
You have been good all year, champ.
Haven't you?

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.237
Thattaboy.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:35.697
Yeah!

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:40.619
Watch this, punk.

01:15:54.424 --> 01:15:56.593
- You good to go on that leg?
- Yeah, I can go.

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:58.470
It feels like a million bucks.

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:02.641
- Let's get it on.
- I can't believe it.

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:03.725
Believe!

01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:07.020
Guys, let's hear it for the real champ,

01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:08.188
Santa Claus!

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:22.202
We believe!

01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:24.871
We believe.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:28.166
We believe. We believe.

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:31.378
We believe. We believe.

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.496
We believe.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:10.000
Oh! Believe!

01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:52.686
- Did you see that?
- The Miracle wins! The Miracle wins!

01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:59.484
Here's your winner, and still XWA
Heavyweight Champion of the world,

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:02.362
Max Miracle!

01:19:10.328 --> 01:19:12.748
Well, you were looking for Santa,
so now you found him.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:14.750
I always thought
you were just Rick, the janitor.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:18.462
Oh, that's always been
a part-time job for me.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.966
What better way to check each name twice
than in person. Hmm?

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:25.469
He was finding out
who was naughty and nice.

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:26.803
You said it, Jennifer.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.598
Don't worry, kid,
you're on the "nice" list.

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.768
So are you like an elf?

01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:35.562
No. Well, kind of.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.272
Actually, yes.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:40.859
Yes.

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:45.197
Right. Uh...

01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:46.948
You know what, Rick,

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:48.909
I think we should, kind of, wrap this up.

01:19:48.992 --> 01:19:51.745
Because we have
quite a long night ahead of us.

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:56.041
You kids have a merry Christmas.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:58.960
And never stop believing.

01:19:59.836 --> 01:20:01.129
Thank you for finding me.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:03.507
Merry Christmas, Rick.

01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:05.342
Merry Christmas.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.225
Gotta keep Santa fed.

01:20:13.683 --> 01:20:15.977
We're gonna stay up all night, Mommy.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.522
- You are?
- Yep.

01:20:19.022 --> 01:20:21.233
Gonna catch him in the act
for the ultimate proof.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:22.692
Oh, good.

01:20:25.028 --> 01:20:27.864
He should be here any minute now.

01:20:29.741 --> 01:20:31.660
Any minute...

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.339
He came. He came. He came!

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:29.301
Oh. Oh, my gosh! Oh, boy.

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.761
I don't know. This one. This one.

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:41.229
Oh, nice. My soldering kit.

01:21:44.816 --> 01:21:46.192
Thanks for all the cool stuff, Mom.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:56.494
I told you guys
we were gonna have a great Christmas.

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:02.208
Hmm... Could there be, maybe,
one more thing under the tree?

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:04.502
I don't know.

01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:08.590
What is this?

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.473
- It's got your name on it.
- Really?

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:23.605
It's my memory box!

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:27.859
And it's got all Dad's stuff inside!

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.989
Wow. He really is a magic man.

01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:37.494
"Incredible things happen
to those who believe."

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:46.670
Remember Aunt Julie's wedding,

01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:49.214
and I asked him to give me his...

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:54.135
Well, that was one heck of a Christmas.

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:57.222
- You said it.
- We got to see Max Miracle

01:22:57.305 --> 01:23:01.601
kick the crap
out of Tucker Von Magnus and DG Haven.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.604
Got to discover Santa, hello.

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:06.606
Well, duh.

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.692
We sure did close out the year
with a bang.

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:10.402
Yeah, but now what?

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.570
What do you mean, "Now what?"

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.991
I say we take a step back,

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:20.620
relax, and enjoy our vacation
like normal sixth graders.

01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:22.914
But there's so much more
to be discovered. Uh...

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:26.960
Trolls, gnomes, uh, D.B. Cooper,

01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:29.045
Loch Ness Monster. Come on.

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:31.089
St. Patty's Day
is right around the corner.

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:32.841
Leprechauns.

01:23:32.924 --> 01:23:35.593
Ghouls, goblins, abominable snowmen. What?

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.262
You guys don't like snow?

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:42.600
They're just around the corner.

01:23:42.892 --> 01:23:44.936
Who doesn't like snow people
wearing green...
