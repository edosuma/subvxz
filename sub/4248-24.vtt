11:07.083 --> 11:08.292
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
MISS MARTIN?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.835
[laughter]

11:09.919 --> 11:12.088
- FABIAN.
- WHAT GIVES?

11:12.171 --> 11:13.172
- [laughs]

11:14.965 --> 11:15.800
- WHOA.

11:15.883 --> 11:16.801
WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS?

11:16.884 --> 11:18.219
- THE DEMISPHERE,

11:18.302 --> 11:20.137
WHICH WAS BASICALLY
THE BOTTOM OF THE CHANDELIER.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.392
"INSIDE THE CORE
OF MY ENEMY'S PRIDE

11:24.475 --> 11:27.520
IS WHERE THE FINAL RELIC HIDES."

11:27.603 --> 11:29.397
- "FINAL RELIC."

11:29.480 --> 11:31.607
- YEAH.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.442
BUT WHOSE ENEMY?

11:33.526 --> 11:34.485
- HI.

11:34.568 --> 11:35.778
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.655
SLEUTHING OR FLIRTING?

11:37.738 --> 11:38.906
- OH, HA, HA, HA.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.116
NO, NINA HAS FOUND
ANOTHER PUZZLE PIECE.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.034
- GREAT.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.078
UM, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

11:44.161 --> 11:48.165
YOU KNOW THE ELIXIR
I BROUGHT BACK FROM THE CELLAR,

11:48.249 --> 11:49.625
WHAT DID WE DO WITH IT,
EXACTLY?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.335
- IT'S UNDER MY MATTRESS.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.169
WHY?

11:52.253 --> 11:53.754
- NO.
NO, THAT'S ALL.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.674
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
IT WAS SOMEWHERE SAFE.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.013
- STRANGE, EVEN FOR ALFIE.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.223
- TALKING OF STRANGE,

12:04.306 --> 12:04.932
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE THE DEMISPHERE WAS?

12:07.059 --> 12:10.187
- WELL, YOU KNOW
MY WEIRD INTUITION MOMENTS?

12:10.271 --> 12:11.814
- MM-HMM.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.232
- THEY'VE BEEN GETTING STRONGER
SINCE SARAH DIED.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.443
- IN WHAT WAY?

12:16.777 --> 12:20.573
- THIS IS GONNA SOUND CRAZY,
BUT...

12:20.656 --> 12:22.992
I'VE BEEN HEARING VOICES.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.996
YOU'RE WONDERING IF I'M INSANE.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.998
- NO.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.459
I'M WONDERING
IF THEY'VE GOTTEN IT WRONG

12:31.542 --> 12:35.212
ABOUT JOY BEING THE CHOSEN ONE.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.423
- FABIAN.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.716
DON'T SAY THAT, OKAY?

12:38.799 --> 12:39.175
IT FREAKS ME OUT A LOT.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.427
- I--

12:41.510 --> 12:42.261
NINA?

12:42.344 --> 12:43.471
- I CAN'T TAKE IT TONIGHT.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.889
IT WILL BE TOO SUSPICIOUS.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.140
WHY CAN'T WE WAIT A FEW DAYS?

12:46.223 --> 12:47.391
- BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOT
A FEW DAYS.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.186
I HAVE TO GIVE MY CLIENT
SOMETHING CONCRETE BY TOMORROW.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.480
SO DURING SUPPER, I WANT YOU
TO GO INTO FABIAN'S ROOM

12:52.563 --> 12:54.607
AND STEAL THE ELIXIR.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.983
- NO, HE'LL KNOW IT'S ME.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.193
- WELL, FINE, I'LL DO IT, THEN.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.569
- NO, THEN HE'LL THINK IT'S ME.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.529
- WHAT, THEN?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.490
- THERE ARE THE PUZZLE PIECES.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.616
THEY'RE LIKE CLUES
THAT LEAD TO THE TREASURE.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.659
NINA FOUND ANOTHER ONE TONIGHT.

13:05.743 --> 13:06.952
THEY'RE REALLY,
REALLY IMPORTANT.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.955
- CAN YOU GET YOUR HANDS
ON THESE PUZZLE PIECES?

13:10.039 --> 13:10.623
- NO.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.959
BUT I CAN DRAW THEM.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.336
- DRAW THEM?

13:17.213 --> 13:18.714
- SHOW YOUR MAN THESE.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.591
HE'LL REALIZE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

13:20.674 --> 13:23.385
AND THEN I'LL GET YOU THE ELIXIR
ON LAUNDRY DAY OR SOMETHING.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.971
- WHEN WE CAN PIN THE BLAME
ON TRUDY.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.224
OKAY, KEEP SKETCHING.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.808
KEEP SKETCHING, PICASSO.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.569
- YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY FEELING
A LOT BETTER, AMBER,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.446
AFTER YOUR FAINTING EPISODE.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.240
- YES, I'M BETTER.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.324
THANKS, TRUDY.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.242
IT WAS TERRIBLE

13:46.325 --> 13:47.409
AND TERRIFYING

13:47.493 --> 13:50.538
AND ALSO FRIGHTENING.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.748
- THANKS, TRUDY.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.083
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.085
- PLACES TO GO, PEOPLE TO SEE.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.461
THANK YOU.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.755
- SO, MICK, ARE YOU JOINING
THE SCHOOL POM-POM SQUAD?

13:59.838 --> 14:02.174
- NO.
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.884
- WASN'T THAT YOUR CHEERLEADING
AUDITION PIECE EARLIER?

14:07.179 --> 14:10.140
[laughter]

14:10.224 --> 14:11.642
- VERY FUNNY.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.103
AMBER, WE'RE ON KITCHEN DUTY.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.062
- BE WITH YOU IN A SEC.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.109
- LOST YOUR APPETITE, ALFIE?

14:20.192 --> 14:20.901
- YEAH, IT WAS DELICIOUS.
THANKS, TRUDY.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.116
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO
SWAP CHORES WITH ME?

14:27.199 --> 14:29.827
- WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO WASHING
WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN?

14:29.910 --> 14:30.786
- LOOK.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.079
I KNOW STUFF,
LOTS OF STUFF,

14:32.162 --> 14:35.374
AND I KNOW THAT YOU JUST NEED TO
GET INTO THAT KITCHEN

14:35.457 --> 14:37.167
AND SORT IT OUT.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.169
THE GUY IS CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.879
- NO, JUST CRAZY.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.423
- THEN YOU'RE PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.632
NOW, JUST GO.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.009
I KNOW YOU WANT TO,

14:45.092 --> 14:48.053
AND I'VE JUST HAD MY NAILS DONE,
SO EVERYONE WINS.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.103
- COME ON, GUYS.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.201
- THERE YOU ARE.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.871
JEROME, WE AGREED WE'D WAIT
A FEW MORE DAYS.

15:13.954 --> 15:14.496
- NO, YOU AGREED.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.832
IT'S NOT THERE.

15:16.915 --> 15:17.875
- WHAT?

15:17.958 --> 15:19.835
- YOUR NEW BUDDY
IS OBVIOUSLY FEEDING YOU

15:19.918 --> 15:21.003
FALSE INFORMATION, ALFIE.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.254
THEY DON'T TRUST YOU.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.380
I TOLD YOU THEY WEREN'T
REAL FRIENDS.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.758
- YEAH, WELL,
HOW COME THEY SWORE ME IN

15:25.841 --> 15:27.134
AS A PLATINUM MEMBER
OF THEIR CLUB?

15:27.217 --> 15:28.844
- THEY'RE JUST USING YOU, ALFIE,

15:28.927 --> 15:30.554
AND YOU USED TO BE
SUCH A GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.306
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR NEW "FRIEND"?

15:32.389 --> 15:33.599
WHO IS THIS GUY?

15:33.682 --> 15:35.476
HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOU CAN TRUST HIM?

15:38.771 --> 15:41.690
- SO BLUE AND WHITE POM-POMS.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.524
- WHAT ABOUT THEM?

15:42.608 --> 15:44.985
- THEY SUIT YOU.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.529
I WOULD HAVE MAYBE ADDED
SOME MATCHING HAIR BOWS.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.864
- DON'T YOU START.

15:48.947 --> 15:51.033
- DIDN'T YOU USED TO HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR ONCE?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.326
- DIDN'T YOU USED TO
GO OUT WITH ME ONCE?

15:52.409 --> 15:54.203
- SEE?

15:54.286 --> 15:55.829
I KNEW YOU HADN'T LOST IT.

15:55.913 --> 15:56.830
- HEY.

15:56.914 --> 15:57.831
- OH!

15:57.915 --> 16:00.918
[laughter]

16:06.340 --> 16:07.049
- DO YOU SURRENDER?
- NO.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.933
- NOT BAD, ALFIE VAN GOGH,
NOT BAD.

16:16.016 --> 16:16.725
THESE SHOULD KEEP RUFUS HAPPY.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.144
FOR A WHILE, AT LEAST.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.479
- RUFUS?

16:20.562 --> 16:22.856
- OH.

16:22.940 --> 16:23.899
- RUFUS ZENO?

16:23.982 --> 16:26.068
THAT'S WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH?

16:26.151 --> 16:27.403
HE'S A TOTAL NUT JOB.

16:27.486 --> 16:27.986
HE KIDNAPPED PATRICIA!

16:28.070 --> 16:30.072
- YEAH, RIGHT.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.657
I THINK WE'D HAVE NOTICED
IF HE KIDNAPPED PATRICIA.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.325
AT THE VERY LEAST, IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN QUIETER AROUND HERE.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.244
HEY.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.245
- I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.746
- ALFIE, GIVE THEM BACK.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.747
- NO!

16:38.831 --> 16:39.748
- HAND THEM OVER, ALFIE.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.874
ALFIE!

16:41.458 --> 16:44.670
- AH!

16:59.017 --> 16:59.101
[indistinct whispering]

17:02.771 --> 17:04.647
- DO YOU SURRENDER?

17:05.648 --> 17:06.650
- YES.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.695
- [sighs]

17:17.536 --> 17:19.413
- WHAT AM I GONNA
SHOW RUFUS TOMORROW?

17:19.496 --> 17:20.455
YOU'LL HAVE TO DRAW SOME MORE.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.040
- NO WAY!

17:22.124 --> 17:22.790
- I NEED THEM.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.294
HE'S PAID ME MONEY.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.753
- SO NOW YOU'VE SIGNED AWAY
YOUR SOUL?

17:26.837 --> 17:28.213
JUST GIVE IT BACK.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.048
- I CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?

17:31.550 --> 17:33.469
- BECAUSE I'VE SPENT IT ALL

17:33.552 --> 17:35.304
ON STUFF
LIKE YOUR HEADGEAR.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.727
- YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE, DUDE.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.354
THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.940
- "INSIDE THE CORE
OF MY ENEMY'S PRIDE

17:47.024 --> 17:48.776
IS WHERE THE FINAL RELIC HIDES."

17:48.859 --> 17:50.068
- THE FINAL RELIC.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.488
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE SO CLOSE.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.823
- CORE.
CORE.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.116
- [laughs]

17:56.200 --> 17:58.494
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE CORBIERE,
AMBER.

17:58.577 --> 18:02.289
CORE! CORE!

18:02.372 --> 18:02.831
- THAT'S IT.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.792
PATRICIA, AMBER.

18:04.875 --> 18:05.876
GENIUS.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.836
- I KNOW!

18:07.920 --> 18:09.004
WHY?

18:09.087 --> 18:11.173
- CORBIERE IS THE PRIDE AND JOY.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.091
- NICE DEDUCTION.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.676
YOU GUYS ARE SO GOOD TOGETHER,

18:14.760 --> 18:16.011
LIKE SCOOBY AND SHAGGY.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.180
- THANKS FOR THAT, AMBER.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.974
- SO THE FINAL CLUE
IS INSIDE CORBIERE?

18:21.058 --> 18:22.267
- I THINK SO.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.395
YES.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.857
- IT'S ME.

18:28.941 --> 18:29.525
WE NEED TO HAVE
AN URGENT MEETING.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.485
- WHAT ABOUT?

18:31.568 --> 18:33.028
- THE BRATS IN THIS HOUSE,

18:33.111 --> 18:35.030
THEY HAVE THE ANKH PIECES.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.949
- WHAT?

18:37.032 --> 18:38.033
ARE YOU SURE?

18:38.116 --> 18:39.326
- WELL, PUT IT THIS WAY.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.036
IF THEY DON'T ACTUALLY
HAVE THE PIECES ALREADY,

18:41.119 --> 18:42.704
THEY CERTAINLY
HAVE THE INFORMATION

18:42.788 --> 18:44.706
TO POINT US
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.292
- I'LL CONTACT DAPHNE
IMMEDIATELY.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.211
- GOOD, I'LL COME OVER NOW.

19:06.311 --> 19:11.066
- ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

19:11.149 --> 19:11.233
- LET'S GO.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.243
ANYTHING?

19:21.326 --> 19:22.786
- NO.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.418
- ISN'T THIS A PICTURE
OF THE OBJECT

19:29.501 --> 19:30.752
THAT GOT STOLEN FROM YOUR SAFE,

19:30.836 --> 19:33.255
THE ONE WE ASSUMED ZENO
HAD TAKEN?

19:33.338 --> 19:35.048
- AND THESE OTHER ITEMS,

19:35.132 --> 19:35.507
ARE THEY WHAT I THINK THEY ARE?

19:35.591 --> 19:38.051
- YES.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.595
- WELL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.888
- I NEED SPACE AND TIME

19:40.971 --> 19:43.348
TO SEARCH THE PLACE THOROUGHLY
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.641
- WE CAN'T JUST
SEARCH THE PLACE.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.644
- THE STUDENTS AND THE PARENTS
WOULD BE UP IN ARMS.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.272
- UNLESS, OF COURSE,
WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO SEARCH.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.693
I HAVE AN IDEA.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.867
- TRY TURNING ITS HEAD.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.119
- EXCUSE ME?

20:04.202 --> 20:05.454
- I SAW THIS FILM ONCE.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.332
- WEIRD TASTE IN FILMS YOU GOT.

20:08.415 --> 20:11.793
OKAY, I'LL TRY WRINGING
THE BIRD'S NECK, BUT I DON'T--

20:13.211 --> 20:16.131
OH, GROSS.

20:16.214 --> 20:17.174
- OH.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.592
UGH.

20:19.927 --> 20:20.928
UGH.

20:23.931 --> 20:24.806
- "END"?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.016
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:26.099 --> 20:27.184
- MAYBE IT MEANS

20:27.267 --> 20:28.727
WE'VE COME TO THE END
OF THE SEARCH?

20:28.810 --> 20:31.271
- SO WHERE'S THE CUP?

20:31.355 --> 20:31.396
[door slams]

20:38.320 --> 20:40.572
- VICTOR'S BACK.
WE NEED TO HURRY.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.075
- BUT HOW DO WE
GET THE HEAD BACK ON?
