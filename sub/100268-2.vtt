Tony’s cover’s blown! Layla Gray
knows he snuck into her race!

00:37.287 --> 00:40.040
Tell me this isn’t as bad
as I think it is.

00:40.123 --> 00:45.003
Oh, he’s in trouble. I once saw a video
of a guy who cut her off in traffic.

00:45.086 --> 00:49.924
Layla ran her car into his trunk, through
the seats and out through the windshield.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.427
And that was her prom date!

00:52.510 --> 00:55.263
Tony’s got this, no problem, guys. Look.

00:55.346 --> 00:59.100
[Cisco] He'll drive through the tunnels
and the construction site,

00:59.184 --> 01:02.312
jump from one garage to another,
and race to the end

01:02.395 --> 01:06.066
in a car he’s never driven
with outlaws trying to destroy him.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.317
He’s good!

01:07.400 --> 01:10.820
Forget about busting into SH1FT3R,
he’ll be lucky to live.

that I wasn’t invited!

01:33.426 --> 01:34.761
[grunts] You think that hurt?

01:40.016 --> 01:41.267
How is she doing that?

Whoa!

Yeah-yeah! This is my kind of race!

03:47.018 --> 03:48.519
[Tony]  What is it Layla?

03:48.603 --> 03:52.315
You’re so quiet all of a sudden.
Afraid of a little competition?

I'm too busy winning right now.

in last place. Tony's in fifth place.

I recognized your driving.
You’ve got Dom’s instincts.

And you must be Shashi Dhar.
I’ve heard of you too.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.408
Hmm. I'm impressed.

08:54.492 --> 08:58.454
These are my streets. Nothing happens
without me knowing about it.

08:58.788 --> 09:02.166
I thought nothing happened
without Layla knowing about it.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.628
But then these people
managed to hack past her security.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.839
I don’t go anywhere without my crew.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.466
Just like Dom.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.804
It was nice getting to know you,
but we’re gonna make an example of y’all

09:14.887 --> 09:18.724
for anyone else who tries to break in.
Get rid of them.

09:18.808 --> 09:22.186
Hold up. Is this how you treat
everyone who wins a race?

09:22.270 --> 09:23.604
You didn't win!

Hey, I know those guys.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.437
I take care of people.
But don’t worry about them.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.022
Let’s talk about you.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.815
So you heard about SH1FT3R,

10:07.898 --> 10:11.652
thought, “we could do that,”
and just stole a car and busted in?

10:11.736 --> 10:14.196
Go big or go home, right? [slurps]

10:14.572 --> 10:18.618
Yes! That's exactly right, Tony.
Go big or go home.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.829
Now that you made it inside,
you survived the race--

10:21.912 --> 10:23.623
Uh, I won the race.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.585
I’ll smack you so hard
your grandma’s dentures will fall out.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.963
As you can see, we’re all
pretty competitive around here.

10:31.339 --> 10:35.468
Let’s just say you tied. So what’s next?
What’s your angle here?

10:36.260 --> 10:39.347
Hey, I’m just looking to drive fast,
have fun. Make money.

10:40.723 --> 10:44.685
That’s what we’re about, man! That hustle!
That’s why you’re here.

10:44.769 --> 10:48.981
[Shashi] You didn’t wait to be given
something, you got it yourself.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.025
You have the fire inside of you.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.154
You see, I’ve raced all over the globe.

10:55.237 --> 11:00.284
Across the Sahara, through the streets
of Mumbai, over Arctic ice caps...

11:00.368 --> 11:04.622
And one thing I’ve learned is that
good drivers are a dime a dozen.

11:04.705 --> 11:09.251
But good people, well,
they are worth their weight in gold.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.339
Once you make it into SH1FT3R,
the world is yours.

11:15.800 --> 11:20.262
But you try to cross us, you try
to come in here and play us somehow?

11:20.346 --> 11:23.933
Then like that,
that dream turns into a nightmare.

11:26.936 --> 11:27.770
Respect.

11:28.270 --> 11:31.816
What about your team?
They know how to handle themselves.

11:32.942 --> 11:37.279
That’s Echo. She built her own
electric car that can crush most tuners.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.701
Cisco over there
is our resident mechanical genius.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.204
Also, our resident bottomless pit.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.499

Nacho and Rollie.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.878

11:58.134 --> 11:59.218

11:59.552 --> 12:03.597
That’s Frostee, our tech guy.
He’s who got past your security.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.101
He’s talking with Jun.
She put in those security measures.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.979
So, you’re the one that cracked my OpSec.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.357
How’d you do it? Backdoor? Botnet?
Mimicked the OTR?

12:13.441 --> 12:16.694
RATed the system with a VPN,
ghosting your encryption.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.654
Argh! I knew that was weak!

12:18.737 --> 12:23.951
Aw, don’t worry.
DJ Drone will cheer you up!

12:24.285 --> 12:30.332
[Frostee over speaker]  You are now about
to get rocked by D-DJ Drone!

12:30.416 --> 12:32.376
[power surges, hip-hop plays]

12:37.214 --> 12:40.342
We had a great first date.
Are we in SH1FT3R or what?

12:40.426 --> 12:43.262
You racers, always moving so fast.

12:43.345 --> 12:46.849
There’s no doubt you have
the skills and the right attitude.

12:47.224 --> 12:51.395
How about this:
you pull a job for me and you’re in.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.438
What's the job?

12:52.813 --> 12:57.776
I have this “friendly” bet going on with a
rival crew led by a guy named Scadan.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.736
A bet?

12:59.069 --> 13:03.657
Yeah, there’s some money in it for the
winner but it’s mostly just for pride.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.658
I bet Scadan

13:04.742 --> 13:09.246
that he and his crew couldn’t transport
a trailer full of Yoka Spirit Water

13:09.330 --> 13:13.375
from Canada to the Mexican border
in less than 24 hours.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.587
We were planning on
stopping them ourselves,

13:16.670 --> 13:20.424
but if you keep that Yoka out of Mexico,
you’re in SH1FT3R.

13:20.841 --> 13:24.887
Of course, they know we might mess
with them, so they have some...

13:24.970 --> 13:26.472
"security measures."

13:29.850 --> 13:31.435
[tense music plays]

13:31.810 --> 13:32.811
How's it looking?

13:32.895 --> 13:35.523
I got them on radar,
we’re almost to the rig.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.150
If we pull this off
we keep the Yoka, right?

13:38.234 --> 13:39.610
[Tony]  Frostee, focus.

13:39.693 --> 13:43.614
I am focused. On my favorite drink!

13:44.073 --> 13:47.576
-[laughs] Whoo!
-[pop music plays]

13:47.660 --> 13:50.371
[Frostee]  It refreshes the mind... body...

13:52.373 --> 13:53.624
and spirit!

13:54.291 --> 13:55.918
[Frostee, deep voice] Yoka!

14:00.172 --> 14:01.006
Yoka!

14:01.674 --> 14:03.551
Well, at least he's motivated.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.804
[Tony]  Good. We have ten miles
to get that truck.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.807
[tense music plays]

14:09.890 --> 14:11.850
[Man] Ha! We’re almost there.

14:11.934 --> 14:15.062
We’re going to win!
What will you do with your money?

14:15.145 --> 14:18.816
I’m gonna see a movie!
Get myself some buttered popcorn.

14:19.733 --> 14:20.568
[grunts]

14:20.651 --> 14:23.362
Good thing you’re big.
But hold that butter.

14:23.445 --> 14:27.283
Shashi never makes anything that easy.
Keep your eyes peeled.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.039
You sure about this?

14:34.123 --> 14:38.127
Of course I’m sure. When have
any of my ideas not worked perfectly?

14:38.210 --> 14:40.504
Literally every time.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.340
True, but we got support now.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.181
[Tony]  How's it looking?

14:51.557 --> 14:54.518
I don’t like this op,
that you went behind my back,

14:54.602 --> 14:56.270
or that I’m stuck with Gary!

14:56.353 --> 14:59.023
Your little stunt put me in a real pickle!

14:59.106 --> 15:01.525
[Tony] I guess you don’t like pickles.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.611
Are you serious? I love pickles!

15:03.694 --> 15:05.988
They’re spicy and salty, just like me.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.615
[scoffs] Touchy.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.533
[Ms. Nowhere]  What did you say?

15:09.617 --> 15:13.662
I was saying thanks for figuring out a way
to drop off this spy gear.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.207
-[Ms. Nowhere]  So I thought...
-Closing in. Gotta go.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.339
[Tony]  Is everyone ready?
We pull this off, we’re in.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.632
-For real!
-So ready.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.759
-[Echo]  You know it!
-Good.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.344
[Tony]  Launch the drones.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.607
[Frostee]  Drones in place.
Projection is go.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.443
[grunts, kisses]

15:44.985 --> 15:49.198
And we’re clear! They’ll never see us
driving right up behind them.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.993
Okay, moving in. I’ll hop on
and disconnect the trailer.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.037
Cisco, get ready to hook up.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.622
[Cisco]  You got it, T.

15:56.705 --> 15:57.539
[Echo grunts]

16:01.585 --> 16:04.421
[thrilling music plays]

16:11.178 --> 16:14.682
[music is silenced]

16:14.765 --> 16:17.601

-[thrilling music plays]

16:34.827 --> 16:36.495
[cab rattles]

16:43.669 --> 16:45.045
No!

16:46.714 --> 16:48.340
We got trouble. Look.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.513
I'm on it. [grunts]

16:54.596 --> 16:56.223
We've got a problem.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.268
Deal with it.
They can't stop us making the border.

17:00.561 --> 17:04.023
That didn’t take long.
All right fam, time to improvise.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.029
[groans]

17:12.656 --> 17:13.741
[grunts]

17:19.663 --> 17:20.622
[gasps]

17:22.541 --> 17:23.751
[grunts]

17:27.796 --> 17:30.466
-Uh, he’s coming up along our side!
-I know!

17:32.134 --> 17:35.012
-The compartment's opening!
-I can see that!

17:36.597 --> 17:38.724
-[gunfire]
-[both shout]

17:41.310 --> 17:43.062
[Frostee] Aah! We got paint!

17:43.145 --> 17:44.938
He's painting us!

17:45.022 --> 17:46.982
-I'm blind!
-I got you.

17:47.066 --> 17:47.941
[screams]

17:48.025 --> 17:51.111
Left! Faster! Slower!

17:51.779 --> 17:53.447
[Cisco] Maybe clean it off?!

17:59.203 --> 18:00.037
[grunts]

18:03.540 --> 18:05.876
-What's that?
-You're about to find out.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.087
[crunching]

18:08.170 --> 18:09.296
[exclaims]

18:09.379 --> 18:11.173
[groans] Oh, no.

18:11.673 --> 18:15.010
[both grunt, pant]

18:15.094 --> 18:16.303

18:20.933 --> 18:24.144
[Tony screams, groans]

18:24.728 --> 18:26.396
[Tony exclaims]

18:29.858 --> 18:31.318
Stay close to the rig.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.655
I’m trying, but I’m being rammed!
[exclaims]

18:34.738 --> 18:37.032
[Echo]  You’re in a truck, ram him back!

18:37.533 --> 18:38.575
Oh, right.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.750
Cisco, get ready.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.963
Ha-ha! You missed.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.047
No, I didn’t.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.216
[grunts, exclaims]

18:54.883 --> 18:55.843
Whoa, whoa!

19:01.265 --> 19:03.684
[power surges, device beeps]

19:04.685 --> 19:06.728
Cisco, fire in the hole!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.818
Whoa!

19:14.027 --> 19:16.113
[Tony screams]

19:17.990 --> 19:19.032
Hey!

19:20.075 --> 19:22.202
Oh, maybe next time, big guy.

19:22.494 --> 19:26.665
[friends whoop and cheer]

19:26.748 --> 19:27.708
Not bad.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.377
Can I have a pickle?

19:30.460 --> 19:31.712
Get your own!

19:33.172 --> 19:34.298
Those are mine.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.594
[Frostee gasps]

19:38.677 --> 19:41.180
The mother lode!

19:41.763 --> 19:45.642
[triumphant music plays]

19:50.314 --> 19:51.732
Tony, you good?

19:52.441 --> 19:55.944
I just realized we're undercover
with a bunch of criminals,

19:56.028 --> 19:59.656
and if they find out...
your lives are on the line.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.617
I don’t know, it's kinda crazy.

20:01.700 --> 20:06.163
We just dislodged a 70 000 pound trailer
at 80 miles an hour.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.372
We know crazy.

20:07.456 --> 20:11.084
That  was  crazy!
I set off that charge and it was like...

20:11.168 --> 20:13.170
[imitates explosion]

20:13.253 --> 20:15.797
And you caught that trailer
with your truck!

20:15.881 --> 20:17.174
How did we do that?!

20:17.257 --> 20:18.258
[Cisco laughs]

20:18.342 --> 20:20.260
You can’t stop family, bro.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.386
We got your back.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.890
Yeah, if we stick together,
we can do anything.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.393
I couldn’t have a better crew.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.818
I don’t like how you did it,
but I like that you did do it.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.821
So, congratulations on a job,
well... done.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.200
That was a real roller coaster ride
of a compliment.

20:43.283 --> 20:46.245
I gotta admit, I like this spy stuff.

20:46.328 --> 20:50.249
It’s as if I was made to secretly
mess with other people.

20:51.416 --> 20:55.963
We can't be caught with our pants down or
hands in the cookie jar or whatever,

20:56.046 --> 20:57.923
so we need serious training.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.967
Gary, give everyone their binder.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.637
[Ms. Nowhere] I've put you on
a beginner’s spy course.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.014
-If you check your--
-Hold up, Nowhere.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.685
We’re doing an awful lot for you.
What’s in it for us?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.561
What do you want?

21:11.645 --> 21:12.646
Well for one...

21:13.438 --> 21:17.901
how about we fix this dump up?
Looks like an abandoned rat food factory.

21:18.944 --> 21:19.778
Fine.

21:19.861 --> 21:24.074
I suppose Uncle Sam could splurge on
some ferns and a cat calendar.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.867
But only the essentials.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.036
[hop-hop plays]

21:28.120 --> 21:31.957
[friends whoop and cheer]

21:32.040 --> 21:33.458
[laughs]

21:34.251 --> 21:35.836
Yeah! Whoo!

21:35.919 --> 21:37.504
Whoo! Aah! Whoa!

21:37.587 --> 21:38.880
[crashing]

21:40.132 --> 21:42.050
[Cisco] Let’s smash these fools!

21:42.134 --> 21:45.137
[grunts, strains]

21:45.220 --> 21:46.221
Yeah!

21:47.180 --> 21:48.515
So this is your place?

21:49.224 --> 21:50.726
It's a work in progress.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.396
[Frostee] Cisco got a boxing ring,

21:54.479 --> 21:57.107
I put computer screens
in a giant Yoka head,

21:57.190 --> 22:01.570
Echo’s got that engine with
like a boat sail on it that’s... "art."

22:02.195 --> 22:03.697
What do you think?

22:04.990 --> 22:05.824
Subtle.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.368
It’s from Shashi.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.371
Welcome to SH1FT3R.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.789
We’ll be in touch.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.002
A mechanical bull?

22:17.419 --> 22:21.423
Yeah, that's right. And you are looking at
the garage record-holder.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.633
Six seconds.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.511
Six seconds? A-And you’re proud of that?

22:26.595 --> 22:28.305
Think you can beat my time?

22:28.388 --> 22:30.057
Step away from the bull.

22:30.515 --> 22:31.975
[grunts]

22:32.976 --> 22:36.313
Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw! Uh-huh!

22:36.396 --> 22:38.440
Yeah! Whoo-whoo!

22:38.523 --> 22:41.276
[Layla] Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
