00:34.200 --> 00:35.702
Peter, you have call.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.537
-No, wait, don't!
-YONDU: <i>Quill?</i>

00:37.620 --> 00:39.164
QUILL: <i>Hey, Yondu.</i>

00:40.165 --> 00:41.791
YONDU: <i>I'm here on Morag.</i>

00:41.875 --> 00:43.251
<i>Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.</i>

00:43.334 --> 00:45.670
QUILL: I was nearby.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.172
YONDU: <i>Well, where are you at now, boy?</i>

00:47.255 --> 00:49.674
I feel bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

00:49.758 --> 00:53.636
<i>We do not do that to each other.</i>
<i>We're Ravagers. We got a code.</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:56.222
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

01:03.521 --> 01:04.606
Put a bounty on him!

01:06.483 --> 01:07.901
<i>But I want him back alive.</i>

01:07.984 --> 01:09.444
-Alive?
-That's what I said.

01:09.527 --> 01:13.073
I told you when you picked that kid up,
you should have delivered him!

01:13.156 --> 01:14.741
He was cargo!

01:14.824 --> 01:16.659
You have always been soft on him.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.037
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

01:19.621 --> 01:21.998
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.084
Soon as we get him back here,

01:25.168 --> 01:26.586
I'm gonna kill him myself.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.797
<i>What we do need to worry about</i>

01:29.506 --> 01:31.674
is who else out there wants that Orb!

01:39.974 --> 01:41.142
Welcome home, Peter.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.396
-No!
-Sorry, boy.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.067
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.485
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

01:53.404 --> 01:54.989
QUILL: If you kill me now,

01:55.824 --> 01:59.160
<i>you are saying goodbye to</i>
<i>the biggest score you have ever seen.</i>

02:00.453 --> 02:01.621
<i>Hey, what do you say, Yondu?</i>

02:01.704 --> 02:04.707
<i>Me and you, taking down a mark</i>
<i>side-by-side, like the old days.</i>

02:06.251 --> 02:07.377
Let him go!

02:08.670 --> 02:11.756
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone
to the planet's surface and zap.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.383
GAMORA: Everything will die.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.344
Won't there be
hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

02:16.427 --> 02:19.430
-I think of Sakaaran as paper people.
-(CHUCKLES)

02:24.686 --> 02:26.312
Remember, boy.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.274
At the end of all this, I get the Stone.

02:30.024 --> 02:32.193
<i>You cross me, we kill you all.</i>

02:33.236 --> 02:34.404
Let's go get 'em, boys!

02:35.446 --> 02:36.739
This is a terrible plan.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.701
A fleet approaches.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.786
They appear to be Ravagers.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.746
Fire!

02:47.250 --> 02:48.585
Come on!

02:51.462 --> 02:52.964
-I'm going down, Quill!
-(ALARM BEEPING)

03:01.556 --> 03:03.433
-(LAUGHING)
-Come on!

03:05.059 --> 03:06.060
GAMORA: <i>No!</i>

03:18.072 --> 03:19.407
Hand it over, son.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.037
Yondu.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.997
Do not open that Orb.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.669
KRAGLIN: Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.299
It's probably good we didn't deliver
him to his dad like we was hired to do.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.801
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.096
Oh! (GRUNTS)

04:01.407 --> 04:02.617
QUILL: Who the hell are you?

04:02.700 --> 04:03.701
I'm your dad, Peter.

04:05.119 --> 04:08.706
EGO: <i>I hired Yondu to pick you up</i>
<i>when your mother passed away.</i>

04:09.332 --> 04:12.669
But instead of returning you,
Yondu kept you,

04:13.419 --> 04:15.421
and I have no clue as to why.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.549
-I thought Yondu was your father.
-What?

04:18.633 --> 04:20.009
We've been together so long,

04:20.093 --> 04:22.220
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

04:23.012 --> 04:24.305
You look exactly alike.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.848
One's blue!

04:27.684 --> 04:29.269
No, he's not my father.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.020
Yondu is the guy who abducted me,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.690
<i>kicked the crap out of me</i>
<i>so I could learn to fight.</i>

04:33.773 --> 04:36.609
TASERFACE: <i>Suppose it's time</i>
<i>for a change in leadership.</i>

04:39.237 --> 04:43.992
It's time for the Ravagers
to rise once again to glory!

04:48.288 --> 04:51.541
He and the other captains
were the only family I ever had.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.042
And I broke the code.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.881
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.843
They killed all my friends.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.850
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.788
-Where to, Cap'n?
-Ego.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.674
The bodies... are his children.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.511
EGO: <i>I had Yondu</i>
<i>deliver some of them to me.</i>

05:45.595 --> 05:47.847
<i>It broke the Ravager code,</i>

05:47.930 --> 05:51.392
<i>but I compensated him generously,</i>
<i>and to ease his conscience,</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:53.019
<i>I said I'd never hurt them.</i>

05:54.228 --> 05:55.855
Hey there, jackass!

05:57.857 --> 06:00.401
Woo-hoo!

06:00.485 --> 06:01.903
You look like Mary Poppins.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.488
Is he cool?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.281
Hell yeah, he's cool.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.116
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

06:08.159 --> 06:10.745
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.663
<i>-T-minus five minutes.</i>
-Aye, Cap'n!

06:15.583 --> 06:17.668
Yondu, we're about to blow!

06:17.752 --> 06:19.337
Get to the ship!

06:19.420 --> 06:21.255
Not without you.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.216
You need to give me this.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.093
I am Groot.

06:25.927 --> 06:26.928
What's that?

06:27.011 --> 06:31.182
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

06:31.891 --> 06:33.976
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

06:45.696 --> 06:47.740
He may have been your father, boy,

06:47.824 --> 06:49.200
but he wasn't your daddy.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.912
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.082
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.671
QUILL: No!

07:02.630 --> 07:04.632
Oh! Oh, come on!

07:04.715 --> 07:07.135
No! No!

07:15.309 --> 07:16.519
I had a pretty cool dad.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.777
DRAX: What is it?

07:29.323 --> 07:30.783
QUILL: It's a Ravager funeral.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.501
Yeah! Yeah!

07:44.672 --> 07:46.507
QUILL: I think Yondu
would want you to have it.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.429
(VOICE BREAKING) Thanks...

07:53.598 --> 07:54.599
Cap'n.
