00:22.055 --> 00:24.691
[chorus singing] <i>Open your eyes</i>
<i>This destiny</i>

00:25.058 --> 00:28.095
<i>If I can't escape it</i>

00:28.161 --> 00:29.696
<i>Then I'll swallow it all down</i>

00:29.763 --> 00:34.201
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And I'll fight</i>

00:34.268 --> 00:35.502
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

00:40.674 --> 00:43.677
<i>The menace that dominates</i>

00:43.744 --> 00:46.780
<i>The darkness in my troubled mind</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:50.117
<i>The truth of a human</i>

00:50.183 --> 00:53.120
<i>Who has begun to lose control</i>

00:53.186 --> 00:55.455
<i>That meaninglessness</i>

00:55.522 --> 00:58.792
<i>I've come to know it</i>

00:59.359 --> 01:01.695
<i>If even counterfeit peace</i>

01:02.062 --> 01:05.465
<i>Will break into pieces</i>

01:05.532 --> 01:10.070
<i>I will cast</i>

01:10.170 --> 01:16.777
<i>A defiant shadow</i>

01:17.644 --> 01:20.647
<i>It's the end of escape</i>
<i>Stand up</i>

01:20.714 --> 01:23.750
<i>Because it's the only way</i>

01:23.817 --> 01:30.090
<i>Follow it</i>
<i>The small hope I aim for</i>

01:30.157 --> 01:33.160
<i>The weakness that spilled</i>
<i>From the proffered hand</i>

01:33.226 --> 01:36.363
<i>I swallowed it all down</i>

01:36.430 --> 01:42.836
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And lost my mind</i>

01:46.573 --> 01:50.811
THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO GET
A LITTLE UNSETTLED

01:52.279 --> 01:54.348
[crowd]
You're holding a board meeting?!

01:54.414 --> 01:55.549
Isn't that reckless?!

01:55.616 --> 01:57.651
What will you do
if something happens?!

01:57.718 --> 02:01.388
No matter what happens to me,
we will not give in to terrorists.

02:02.189 --> 02:03.757
I'm Chief Cabinet Secretary Mitsui.

02:04.157 --> 02:06.293
In response
to these repeated acts of terrorism,

02:06.360 --> 02:09.396
the government has made plans
at this meeting

02:09.463 --> 02:12.532
to take special measures
against certain Ajin.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.835
<i>And along with these measures,</i>

02:14.901 --> 02:17.404
<i>the ministries have come together</i>
<i>to form a new defense unit.</i>

02:18.338 --> 02:22.776
<i>The new unit will be called</i>
<i>the Anti-Ajin Special Forces.</i>

02:26.480 --> 02:27.814
What the hell...?

02:28.415 --> 02:32.386
Forget about our civil rights, this just
keeps getting worse and worse! Damn it!

02:34.321 --> 02:36.423
Anti-Ajin Special Forces?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.292
How can we take on something like that?

02:39.359 --> 02:41.328
Tanaka, what are we going
to do about this?

02:41.395 --> 02:43.530
If we screw up,
we'll all end up in a lab!

02:45.499 --> 02:46.800
I told you before...

02:47.668 --> 02:50.337
there's no turning back now.

02:50.404 --> 02:55.709
-Yeah, but--
-There's nowhere to go back to now.

02:56.510 --> 03:00.814
We just have to trust Sato.

03:10.490 --> 03:15.195
This is our new
and improved blinding laser.

03:15.862 --> 03:16.863
Please have a look.

03:16.930 --> 03:20.200
Zero point three seconds
of exposure damages the retina,

03:20.267 --> 03:21.501
resulting in blindness.

03:24.337 --> 03:29.476
We've also increased the power
of this Taser gun to 2 million volts.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.814
Doesn't matter if you're an Ajin or not,
you will be immobilized instantly.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.283
[man] It's wireless?

03:37.384 --> 03:43.256
Yes. It's handy in a skirmish
and can now fire several shots in a row.

03:44.324 --> 03:48.962
We've also made the impulse water cannons
smaller for dealing with IBMs.

03:49.496 --> 03:53.667
Oh, and we've prepared
smoke grenades as well.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.802
And, finally, this...

03:56.770 --> 04:02.476
An airburst grenade launcher, jointly
developed with a German arms maker.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.278
It hasn't been deployed
in a real fight yet,

04:05.345 --> 04:08.849
but when we tested it here,
they started calling it "The Executioner."

04:08.915 --> 04:10.650
It made the folks here very happy.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.919
The Executioner, you say.

04:14.287 --> 04:18.925
Since the grenade detonates
precisely above the target's head,

04:18.992 --> 04:21.461
it renders
any sort of shielding ineffective.

04:22.896 --> 04:23.864
Have a look.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.268
We've verified how effective it is
by using it against the Ajin Tanaka.

04:30.804 --> 04:34.541
The laser rangefinder measures
the distance to the target

04:34.608 --> 04:39.679
and automatically sets the airburst
detonation position on the round's fuse.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.817
An outstanding weapon.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.953
I'm pleased that you like it.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.656
I'll prep one
for each member of your team.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.760
I honestly didn't think
they'd have progressed this far.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.564
In a few days,
Sato will be headed for the lab.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.686
Ah, that's right. Mr. Nekozawa.

05:20.787 --> 05:24.391
Beginning next week some time,
you should probably go abroad for a while.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.629
This country is going to get
a little unsettled.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.835
Mr. Sato, just how far
do you intend to take this?

05:35.068 --> 05:36.036
Hmm?

05:37.771 --> 05:39.873
Until I've taken over the country.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.481
[Nagai] <i>We're putting our plan</i>
<i>into motion in two days.</i>

05:48.882 --> 05:51.751
This really will be our last chance.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.921
The field is going
to be Musashi Heavy Industries HQ.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.724
According to Mr. Tosaki's report,

05:57.791 --> 06:01.861
the board meeting is going to be held
in the chairman's office on the top floor.

06:03.597 --> 06:07.033
The AASF will be setting up a barricade
in the vicinity of the 24th floor.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.370
We're going to hide ourselves here.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.773
The supply room
on the 21st floor would be ideal.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.876
So, when Sato and them attack,
we burst out and fight, yeah?

06:16.943 --> 06:19.112
[Nagai] I haven't said anything
remotely like that.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.115
[Izumi] We just wait to start.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.685
We don't want to get tangled up
in the fight between the AASF and Sato.

06:26.019 --> 06:26.953
Yeah, right.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.556
If Sato takes out the AASF,
then we move.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.959
Shimomura and myself
will handle close-quarters battles,

06:33.026 --> 06:34.995
and you'll move to back us up, Nakano.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.131
Mr. Tosaki, I'd like you
to be on radio support.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.800
I've already got my tools ready to go.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.102
That...

06:43.470 --> 06:45.071
leaves only one more problem.

06:46.473 --> 06:50.577
As far as the measures we need to take
in order to intervene in the fight...

06:53.413 --> 06:55.949
This isn't the same situation
as we had with the minister.

06:56.182 --> 06:59.085
-We should consider a different approach.
-Nobody asked you.

07:01.488 --> 07:04.190
Come on, Mr. Tosaki,
don't tell me you're still mad.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.525
Shut it.

07:06.626 --> 07:09.496
I'll come up with something,
just like we planned.

07:19.639 --> 07:24.444
Mr. Tosaki, I just can't agree with this.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.048
-This could land you in prison for life.
-Just shut up and drive.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.485
Yes, sir.

07:55.875 --> 07:59.779
Former foreign mercenary rejects
from the Self Defense Force?

07:59.846 --> 08:02.816
They worked under my predecessor,
and I kept them on board.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.952
With the minister's permission,
of course.

08:09.189 --> 08:12.926
You want to use them as insurance
in case the AASF goes down?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.060
Exactly.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.664
They're used to handling Ajin

08:17.731 --> 08:19.799
and professionals
when it comes to combat.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.568
This is out of the question.

08:23.937 --> 08:28.675
Besides, you're off the commission.

08:30.176 --> 08:34.781
The only reason there's been no formal
dismissal is the minister's assassination.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.583
That's why I want one last chance.

08:36.649 --> 08:37.784
[cell phone ringing]

08:39.719 --> 08:40.787
What is it?

08:42.622 --> 08:43.923
Okay, understood.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.259
I'll be right there.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.231
As you can see, I'm a busy man.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.300
Forgive me, but I have to be going.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.672
That day that we were attacked here,

09:00.807 --> 09:02.876
I killed the Defense Department agent.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.881
They found out
about us keeping Dr. Ogura.

09:09.616 --> 09:10.717
Damn it all.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.320
What the hell are you saying?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.991
Have you finally lost your mind?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.060
Perhaps.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.998
But if I let this get out,

09:25.799 --> 09:28.201
you and I are both going to hell.

09:29.836 --> 09:30.770
Why me?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.340
[man] <i>Ikuya Ogura is alive.</i>

09:36.242 --> 09:38.078
<i>I've gotta hand it to him.</i>

09:39.279 --> 09:41.981
To think he'd meddle
with one of the Americans...

09:48.655 --> 09:50.924
We know nothing about this.
Is that clear?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.660
We know nothing.

09:56.062 --> 09:58.965
<i>Mr. Tosaki is acting entirely</i>
<i>under his own authority.</i>

10:05.939 --> 10:07.941
Classic organized crime.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.744
Guess I'll be seeing you in hell, friend.

10:18.184 --> 10:21.654
So, we're adding four people
to the security force?

10:21.721 --> 10:22.655
Five.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.824
I'll have Shimomura with me.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.864
Oh, and one more thing.

10:31.931 --> 10:32.966
There's something else?

10:33.032 --> 10:35.735
[Tosaki] Put me back on the commission.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.837
[woman] <i>Yes. This is Security.</i>

10:39.205 --> 10:40.273
[groans]

10:40.707 --> 10:41.708
<i>Mr. Sokabe?</i>

10:49.082 --> 10:50.383
So, things went well?

10:58.091 --> 10:59.092
I got this for you.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.302
Mr. Tosaki...

11:13.206 --> 11:14.807
I'm sorry about the oth--

11:18.378 --> 11:20.413
You were simply doing your job.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.249
There's nothing to apologize for.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.987
What are you doing? Let's go.

11:30.890 --> 11:31.758
Yes, sir.

11:40.466 --> 11:43.336
Our secret weapon's ready just in time.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.409
[Sato] It's beautiful.

11:54.013 --> 11:58.151
TOUTO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

12:11.931 --> 12:15.435
MUSASHI HEAVY INDUSTRIES

12:19.839 --> 12:20.907
Hey, that's the...

12:22.108 --> 12:23.910
Yeah, the AASF.

12:26.079 --> 12:31.084
I'm coming to you 500 meters
from the HQ of Musashi Heavy Industries.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.021
It is now less than six hours until
the time Sato has said he will attack.

12:35.955 --> 12:39.459
<i>Sources have told us that Anti-Ajin</i>
<i>Special Forces have been deployed</i>

12:39.525 --> 12:41.127
<i>and are on guard.</i>

12:42.128 --> 12:45.765
<i>Musashi Heavy Industries has also ordered</i>
<i>an evacuation of all its employees.</i>

12:45.832 --> 12:50.236
<i>Only Chairman Hashiguchi and several of</i>
<i>the board members remain in the office.</i>

12:56.476 --> 12:58.111
Tonight,

12:58.778 --> 13:01.547
we're going to bring the hammer down
on the last corporation

13:02.015 --> 13:06.953
<i>that treats Ajin like economic animals,</i>
<i>subjecting us to monstrous experiments.</i>

13:08.321 --> 13:15.094
This will be a giant step towards
the future that we are aiming for.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.034
We leave at 1700 hours.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.903
Let's make some noise.

13:50.229 --> 13:51.431
Sorry for the wait!

13:52.899 --> 13:55.168
[both panting]

14:00.406 --> 14:01.507
[Izumi] <i>We're in position.</i>

14:02.041 --> 14:03.142
Roger that.

14:03.209 --> 14:06.345
FK, do you copy? We're counting on you
for ghost countermeasures.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.183
That's no way to address a genius.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.585
[Tosaki] <i>Give orders the instant</i>
<i>there are any indications.</i>

14:14.120 --> 14:18.324
No matter how you slice it, I can't
really imagine we'll need the insurance.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.227
Agreed. If the AASF can't beat him,

14:21.427 --> 14:24.397
there'll be no one left in this country
who can stop Sato.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.932
[woman] This is Comm 1,
satellite settings complete.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.068
We've even got satellites?
Sparing no expense, I see.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.504
We got permission
from the cabinet secretary.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.373
The government isn't messing around.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.908
We're going to put an end
to this nonsense today.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.022
[woman] <i>Under five minutes to go.</i>

14:50.523 --> 14:52.191
<i>No change on the satellite image.</i>

15:00.666 --> 15:03.469
-[man 1] <i>Point Two. All clear.</i>
-[man 2] <i>This is Point Three. All clear.</i>

15:03.536 --> 15:05.171
[man 3] <i>Point Four here. All clear.</i>

15:05.238 --> 15:06.539
What's their plan?

15:06.606 --> 15:09.008
Well, they won't be able
to take down the building.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.444
There's no way
they can pull that off this time.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.580
Our anti-airline terror measures
are in place.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.282
We've also closed off the sewers.

15:17.016 --> 15:20.219
<i>This is an impregnable fortress.</i>

15:22.588 --> 15:26.359
[Sato] <i>Well, let's get this started,</i>
<i>shall we?</i>

15:26.426 --> 15:27.427
Roger.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.000
Mr. Chairman, it's almost time.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.702
Hmm? Ah.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.677
Let's get started.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.448
NO ENTRY

15:55.455 --> 15:57.557
-Hey! Stop right there!
-Unauthorized vehicle!

16:03.729 --> 16:07.066
[man] <i>This is Point Two! An unauthorized</i>
<i>vehicle has stopped at the barricade!</i>

16:07.133 --> 16:08.568
They're coming from the front?!

16:08.634 --> 16:10.736
Like moths to the flame.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.105
Don't worry about casualties!
Just secure it!

16:13.406 --> 16:17.043
To anyone onboard! Get out of the vehicle
with both hands in the air! Now!

16:18.377 --> 16:19.512
Get out!

16:22.982 --> 16:24.083
Got him!

16:25.551 --> 16:26.452
All too easy.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.087
Secure the vehicle!

16:36.462 --> 16:38.164
What is it?

16:44.270 --> 16:47.006
Why, it's our secret weapon of course.

17:05.591 --> 17:08.094
We need power! Power!

17:08.361 --> 17:09.729
What's going on?!

17:11.097 --> 17:12.198
It's coming down!

17:13.699 --> 17:15.034
Run for cover!

17:36.622 --> 17:38.691
You're up, Okuyama.

17:46.832 --> 17:49.602
How...? How could this...?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.471
-What happened?!
-Report!

17:52.538 --> 17:55.641
All electronics are down!
They won't reboot!

17:55.708 --> 17:57.476
We've lost all power!

17:58.544 --> 18:02.114
Shimomura, do you copy?
Shimomura?! Damn it.

18:02.448 --> 18:03.516
What's going on?

18:06.786 --> 18:08.254
An EMP.

18:09.455 --> 18:13.159
They made an explosive generator.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.829
And that energy fries the circuitry
in any electronic device.

18:17.697 --> 18:22.868
Every piece of electronics within a radius
of several hundred meters is likely dead.

18:23.135 --> 18:23.836
[gasps]

18:24.103 --> 18:25.438
[drones whirring]

18:28.407 --> 18:29.609
What the hell?

18:31.711 --> 18:32.778
Open fire!

18:34.580 --> 18:35.581
Let's make some noise.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.425
Damn it...

18:48.794 --> 18:53.366
I love it when a plan comes together.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.810
Okay, the anchor has been placed.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.445
Pull the lead rope.

19:06.512 --> 19:07.847
Roger.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.850
What's going on?

19:11.384 --> 19:12.251
Yo, Nagai!

19:12.485 --> 19:13.686
Take it easy, Nakano.

19:14.353 --> 19:15.655
Let your eyes adjust first.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.891
Mr. Tosaki. Mr. Tosaki!

19:19.458 --> 19:21.227
No good. The radios are dead, too.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.529
What should--? What should we do?!

19:23.596 --> 19:25.197
Just settle down, Nakano.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.733
-We just need to wait like planned.
-No.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.203
Let's move.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.745
[man] <i>Now I'm an electrician?</i>

19:40.479 --> 19:42.615
More like a power line technician.

19:43.916 --> 19:49.922
Airburst grenade launcher, Taser gun,
blinding laser, all unusable.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.791
Our comm equipment is down, too.

19:52.591 --> 19:54.894
This situation may actually
have given us a chance.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.196
I have an idea.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.334
Discard all your electronics.
We're going with standard equipment.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.804
[glass breaking then guns cocking]

20:10.476 --> 20:15.881
[Sato] And now, a primal fight,
with only fire and blades.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.753
Exciting, isn't it?

20:24.256 --> 20:25.591
Is this actually gonna work?

20:25.958 --> 20:28.527
Sato's a man of his word.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.696
And that's going to be his undoing.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.266
Let's put our plan into action.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.512
TO BE CONTINUED

20:47.813 --> 20:50.850
[chorus singing]
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

20:50.916 --> 20:54.320
<i>I'll trade it</i>

20:54.386 --> 20:59.525
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

21:00.659 --> 21:06.866
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

21:06.966 --> 21:12.638
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

21:13.439 --> 21:17.543
<i>You can see them all</i>

21:19.779 --> 21:24.316
<i>When you come to my house</i>

21:24.383 --> 21:30.422
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

21:30.489 --> 21:32.591
<i>While the wind blows</i>

21:32.658 --> 21:36.862
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

21:38.964 --> 21:45.371
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

21:45.437 --> 21:51.677
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

21:51.744 --> 21:57.650
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

21:58.317 --> 22:00.886
<i>"Be my friend</i>

22:00.953 --> 22:07.793
<i>Always"</i>

22:19.939 --> 22:21.941
