to my parents, okay?

16:49.718 --> 16:51.886
And I'm gonna play
with my puppy,

16:51.970 --> 16:53.096
and I'm gonna have a good dinner

16:53.179 --> 16:55.432
and sleep
in my own wonderful bed.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.100
And you know what?
I'm even looking forward

16:57.183 --> 16:59.227
to having
my stupid freaking bat mitzvah.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.731
What? We have to warn them.
They're walking into an ambush.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.442
I am done watching people die.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.450
KJ is right.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.744
It's not our problem.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.706
[sighs] I'll even be glad to see
my shithole of a house again.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.541
I'll even be glad

17:21.624 --> 17:24.669
to wake up for my stupid
paper route tomorrow.

17:24.753 --> 17:28.631
- Forget that. I'm quitting
the paper route for sure.
- [Mac] Yeah.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.717
You might be
onto something there.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.053
- [scoffs]
- Hello? You guys are missing
the bigger picture here.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.973
Nothing can go back to normal
right now.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.391
What are you talking about?

17:43.021 --> 17:44.606
We still have this.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.775
It's a guide
to every known folding.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.902
There's a war going on,
remember?

17:48.985 --> 17:50.445
We can't just go home.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.447
We have to help win this thing

17:52.530 --> 17:53.823
and get this book
to Heck and Naldo.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.533
It's the key.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.327
And if we don't do something
within the next hour,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.496
the versions of us
that already exist in '88

17:59.579 --> 18:03.333
are gonna go through everything
we just did all over again.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.877
They'll chase Heck and Naldo,
Erin will get shot,

18:05.960 --> 18:08.046
and we'll end up
in their time capsule thing

18:08.129 --> 18:10.965
and arrive in 2019
and all of that craziness.

18:11.049 --> 18:15.178
Hello? We are the versions of us
that exist in '88.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.721
Why are there flags everywhere?

18:16.805 --> 18:19.390
It's supposed to be Halloween.

18:40.537 --> 18:44.958
July 3, 1999.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.460
That's what the paper says.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.507
[crying]
No.

18:52.590 --> 18:56.970
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.763
Fuck this.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.682
There has to be
some kind of mistake,

19:00.765 --> 19:02.100
like there was an error
in the coordinates

19:02.183 --> 19:03.476
when we went into the folding

19:03.560 --> 19:05.520
or the Old Watch sabotaged
the entire mission.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.896
[KJ] Tiffany.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.983
Jesus Christ.
Is it not obvious what happened?

19:10.066 --> 19:12.068
- What?
- Larry lied to us!

19:12.151 --> 19:14.612
He wasn't ever
gonna take us home!

19:14.696 --> 19:17.323
- No way. No, he wouldn't.
- [KJ] So you think it's what?

19:17.407 --> 19:20.118
A coincidence that we landed
in the exact year

19:20.201 --> 19:22.579
that he wanted to go to
before you pitched

19:22.662 --> 19:25.415
your brilliant fucking plan?
You know what, Tiffany?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.584
- KJ!
- He would've said anything

19:27.667 --> 19:29.794
to make Erin pilot
that stupid robot.

19:29.878 --> 19:32.422
All he cared about was
getting that to '99 for the STF.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.757
- He didn't give a shit
about us.
- [Tiff] KJ!

19:37.802 --> 19:39.888
[KJ] Old Erin died for a lie.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.564
But how?

19:52.567 --> 19:54.569
He said we were chosen.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.656
Tiff.

20:00.241 --> 20:03.912
We weren't chosen for anything.

20:03.995 --> 20:06.372
We were an accident.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.139
[Mac sighs]

20:25.224 --> 20:27.602
[Mac] You doing all right?

20:27.685 --> 20:30.271
I, um...

20:37.695 --> 20:39.948
Were you always wearing
those pants?

20:40.949 --> 20:43.451
I need you.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.537
I need you
to steal something for me.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.136
[entry bell chimes]

21:02.220 --> 21:04.013
Yeah, we were at Mike's.

21:04.097 --> 21:08.267
I don't know, just, like,
played video games and...

21:09.686 --> 21:11.688
A couple hours.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.441
[entry bell chimes]

21:18.569 --> 21:20.571
Yeah, we ordered a pizza.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.839
[Mac] What the hell?

21:55.648 --> 21:57.191
[man] Baby,
I-I told you this already.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.193
We're just friends.

21:59.277 --> 22:01.863
We-we were hanging out
with a bunch of people.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.203
Come on, babe.

22:27.472 --> 22:30.641
Shit! Babe, hold on.
I swear I'll call you back.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.810
- What are you doing?
- I'm so sorry.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.271
- The handle got stuck, and...
- Look. Just step back, okay?

22:35.354 --> 22:37.190
Try not to step in it.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.319
- Sorry!
- [door creaks]

22:47.867 --> 22:49.786
[Mac] I didn't get the pads.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.996
They looked
like full-on baby diapers,

22:52.080 --> 22:54.040
so I got these instead.

22:54.123 --> 22:56.209
I'm pretty sure
they're the same.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.877
[Tiff] Can I see them?

22:59.629 --> 23:01.964
- What do you think "super"
and "regular" mean?
- [Mac] Obviously

23:02.048 --> 23:03.633
the size of your vagina.

23:03.716 --> 23:04.675
You sure?

23:04.759 --> 23:06.469
Yes.

23:06.552 --> 23:09.097
I'd probably be a super.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.266
How do you, like, measure it?

23:12.350 --> 23:14.393
- Ask KJ.
- How would I know?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.230
Oh, I get it.
Because I have emotions,

23:17.313 --> 23:19.148
- you think I had it already?
- [Mac] No.

23:19.232 --> 23:20.483
We think you've had it
'cause you're rich

23:20.566 --> 23:22.068
and you ride horses and shit.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.903
- Yeah.
- You can get it from a horse?

23:23.986 --> 23:26.114
- No.
- I think
it's from riding the horse.

23:26.197 --> 23:27.698
- No, that doesn't happen.
- That's not what I've heard.

23:27.782 --> 23:29.033
Well, it didn't happen to me.

23:30.493 --> 23:33.162
So you haven't had your...

23:50.138 --> 23:53.516
Guess I'm a regular.

23:55.810 --> 23:58.104
[tampon unwrapping]

24:06.279 --> 24:08.781
How do I get it...

24:08.865 --> 24:11.242
in-in me?

24:11.325 --> 24:13.661
How do you get it out?

24:13.744 --> 24:15.163
There has to be instructions.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.750
It just says it gives you

24:19.834 --> 24:21.586
"out of sight
and out of mind protection."

24:21.669 --> 24:23.087
Let me see?

24:31.679 --> 24:33.639
Here we go.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.609
Okay. First,
you wash your hands,

24:44.692 --> 24:46.194
and then you get
into a comfortable position.

24:46.277 --> 24:47.653
Should I lie down?

24:47.737 --> 24:49.780
[Tiff] Mm-mm.
You should sit on the toilet

24:49.864 --> 24:52.241
- with your knees apart.
- How is that comfortable?

24:52.325 --> 24:54.493
I don't know.
I'm just reading this.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.747
And then you, um,

24:57.830 --> 25:00.541
push the tampon

25:00.625 --> 25:04.545
inside, you know, that area.

25:04.629 --> 25:06.088
And then how do you get it out?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.299
It says you loosen your muscles,

25:08.382 --> 25:10.676
and then you pull it out
by the removal string.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.762
- Which muscles?
- It doesn't say.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.056
It's gotta be vagina muscles.

25:15.139 --> 25:18.059
I-I don't think mine has those.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.479
What if it never comes out?

25:21.562 --> 25:23.522
- I guess your body
just absorbs it.
- [Mac] No.

25:23.606 --> 25:25.441
It's like gum.
It stays inside you forever

25:25.524 --> 25:27.068
and slowly rots.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.570
[KJ] Wait, what's this thing
on the back, this white circle?

25:29.654 --> 25:31.155
It's some kind of warning.

25:31.239 --> 25:33.950
Apparently, you can get Toxic
Shock Syndrome from tampons.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.409
What the fuck?

25:35.493 --> 25:38.079
Fever, vomiting,
rash, diarrhea...

25:38.162 --> 25:39.121
[KJ] Let me see that.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.582
Yeah. Guys, this is bad.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.042
[Tiff] Yeah, it's really bad.

25:43.125 --> 25:46.170
One of my mom's friends got it
and her leg fell off.

25:46.254 --> 25:48.339
She's still alive, though.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.842
- She just doesn't have a leg.
- [Erin] I can't.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.302
I quit.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.680
I don't think you can
quit your period.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.765
Oh, no, I can't do this.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.725
I can't.
Take it. Take it.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.812
I'll get you a diaper.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.487
How you doing in there?

26:14.282 --> 26:16.784
- Erin, you doing okay?
- Uh, I think so.

26:16.867 --> 26:20.788
When she comes out, we need
to find something to eat.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.873
And we need to find
someplace to sleep.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.376
We need to get somewhere safe.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.128
Then we can start going
through this book

26:27.211 --> 26:29.422
and trying to figure out
how to get home.

26:29.505 --> 26:32.925
Well, we're not going to
any of our families.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.343
That's for sure.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.887
None of us want a repeat of...

26:36.971 --> 26:40.182
you know... Erin.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.228
- This time, we're on our own.
- [Tiff] I agree.

26:44.312 --> 26:45.646
We need to be careful,

26:45.730 --> 26:48.190
but how are we supposed
to survive on our own?

26:48.274 --> 26:51.193
We're kids. We need help.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.114
Homeless shelter?

26:55.197 --> 26:56.198
Uh...

26:56.282 --> 26:59.577
What? They serve food and shit.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.370
Mac, we're not going
to a homeless shelter.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.372
All right, it was just an idea.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.461
Oh, the school.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.755
It's summer break,
so it'll be empty.

27:10.838 --> 27:12.089
Yeah, which probably means
the electricity and water

27:12.173 --> 27:13.507
are shut off.

27:13.591 --> 27:14.925
But I bet we could figure out
how to turn it on.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.594
Which will probably make
the cops come.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.138
Maybe just cool it
on the ideas for a sec, Tiff.

27:24.685 --> 27:26.687
[train horn blares in distance]

27:28.814 --> 27:32.234
All right, fine.
We can go to my house.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.154
I don't think
that's the best call.

27:35.237 --> 27:36.947
Every Fourth of July weekend,

27:37.031 --> 27:38.574
my parents and I go
to Lake Erie,

27:38.657 --> 27:40.076
and we stay on our boat.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.827
Of course you do.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.704
The house will be empty.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.247
We can go there,
we can get some supplies

27:45.331 --> 27:46.540
and crash there for the night.

27:46.624 --> 27:48.167
And then we'll think of
a more permanent solution

27:48.250 --> 27:49.585
tomorrow morning.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.213
Great.

27:55.049 --> 27:56.801
You sure?

27:58.636 --> 28:00.846
It'll be fine for the night.

[KJ] Hmm?

28:16.570 --> 28:20.241

Now let's go.

[Tiff] It wasn't just me.
We all believed him.

28:43.139 --> 28:45.641
It made sense.
I had a really good plan

28:45.724 --> 28:47.601
to use the robot
to get us to '88,

28:47.685 --> 28:48.894
but that doesn't make it
my fault

28:48.978 --> 28:50.771
- he used that idea to trick us.
- No, not at all.

28:50.855 --> 28:53.691
You guys understand that, right?

28:53.774 --> 28:55.860
Maybe Larry's just a liar, Tiff.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.903
Yeah, but what he wrote
in the book is real.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.572
He thought the STF
would be here.

28:59.655 --> 29:00.906
He thought it was important.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.867
How about you relax, Tiff?

29:02.950 --> 29:05.953
You don't have to talk
all the time, you know?

what everybody else think.

- No, Tiff.

44:54.859 --> 44:56.611
Uh, film school.
We go to NYU.

44:58.446 --> 45:00.532
KJ doesn't go to
business school?

45:00.615 --> 45:02.492

No. Why?

45:02.575 --> 45:04.285
Did her mom tell you that?

45:04.369 --> 45:06.913
I think old Nora would have
preferred that instead.

45:06.996 --> 45:08.581
Yeah.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.920
- What do you do in film school?
- Well,

45:14.003 --> 45:16.881
we pay the school
a lot of money

45:16.965 --> 45:20.552
to study classic films
in order to try to figure out

45:20.635 --> 45:22.429
what makes a good movie.

45:22.512 --> 45:25.140
At least I think
that's the intention.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.225
But we also
make our own, and,

45:27.308 --> 45:28.518
you know, hopefully
one day we'll end up

45:28.601 --> 45:31.646
with our name on one of
those posters, who knows?

have her show you.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.195

45:39.279 --> 45:40.864

Do you like movies?

45:50.874 --> 45:55.295
Uh, pfft, yeah, I guess so.

45:55.378 --> 45:57.630
I haven't really seen
that many, though.

45:57.714 --> 46:00.425

really get into them until

46:00.508 --> 46:02.886

46:02.969 --> 46:05.180

there was no return.

He's a director.

insanely good movies,

a Kubrick marathon this weekend,

46:22.697 --> 46:23.781
