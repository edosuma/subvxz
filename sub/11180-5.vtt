WEBVTT

00:01.449 --> 00:03.934
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.073 --> 00:06.558
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:06.696 --> 00:11.666
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.804 --> 00:14.566
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.704 --> 00:17.569
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.707 --> 00:21.538
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.299 --> 00:25.749
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:25.887 --> 00:28.511
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.649 --> 00:30.996
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.134 --> 00:33.723
Just to get up that hill

00:33.861 --> 00:36.346
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.484 --> 00:38.969
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.108 --> 00:41.420
As long as we live
it's you and me, baby

00:41.558 --> 00:43.560
Ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.698 --> 00:46.046
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.184 --> 00:49.049
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.187 --> 00:53.536
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.674 --> 00:56.470
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.608 --> 00:59.507
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.645 --> 01:04.305
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:15.178 --> 01:17.422
Hey, hey, hey,
Weezy!

01:17.560 --> 01:18.802
Mwah!

01:20.252 --> 01:22.944
How was everything
down in Charlie's Bar?

01:23.083 --> 01:25.499
Who told you I was
in Charlie's Bar?

01:25.637 --> 01:27.294
You did,
the minute you said,

01:27.432 --> 01:29.986
"Hey, Weezy!"

01:31.332 --> 01:32.920
You'll never guess
what I picked up today.

01:33.058 --> 01:35.267
If it's catching,
don't bring it in here.

01:35.405 --> 01:37.649
It's a riddle
I can win bets with.

01:37.787 --> 01:39.616
It cost me a buck,
but it was worth it.

01:39.754 --> 01:41.239
See if you can figure
this one out...

01:41.377 --> 01:44.034
Now, these two dudes live
next door to each other, see.

01:44.173 --> 01:45.381
Now one dude
raises chickens

01:45.519 --> 01:46.692
and the other dude
hates chickens.

01:46.830 --> 01:47.831
What kind of chickens?

01:47.969 --> 01:49.799
Leghorns or
Rhode Island Reds?

01:51.214 --> 01:52.905
What difference
does that make?

01:53.043 --> 01:54.493
Lots.

01:54.631 --> 01:56.599
My mother used to say
Rhode Island Reds
were fatter

01:56.737 --> 01:59.360
because they didn't
have to walk as far
to get to New York.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.439
That was one of our
family jokes, George.

02:09.577 --> 02:10.751
Mother used to say...

02:10.889 --> 02:12.546
Look, you gonna let me
finish my riddle or not?

02:12.684 --> 02:14.306
I'm listening,
aren't I?

02:14.444 --> 02:16.895
Well, try listening
with your mouth closed.

02:17.033 --> 02:19.173
Okay, now.
So one day,

02:19.311 --> 02:21.141
this rooster breaks over
into the yard of the guy

02:21.279 --> 02:22.832
who hates chickens
and lays an egg.

02:22.970 --> 02:25.386
What color was the egg?
White or brown?

02:25.524 --> 02:27.319
What difference
does the color make,
white or brown?

02:27.457 --> 02:28.941
One color's
just as good as the other.

02:29.079 --> 02:33.394
Just remember that
the next time
the Willises come down.

02:35.258 --> 02:38.123
Weezy.
I'm sorry, George.

02:38.261 --> 02:40.021
I'm just trying
to get the facts.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.678
I'm giving you
all the facts you need!

02:41.816 --> 02:44.198
Now...even though
he don't raise chickens,

02:44.336 --> 02:46.200
the chicken-hater claims
that the egg is his

02:46.338 --> 02:47.684
because it's laid
in his yard.

02:47.822 --> 02:51.895
Now the big question is,
who owns the egg?

02:53.587 --> 02:55.830
Would you repeat that?

02:55.968 --> 02:57.556
I ain't
telling it again!

02:57.694 --> 03:00.076
All right.

03:00.214 --> 03:03.321
Uh...the man who
raises the chickens.

03:03.459 --> 03:05.219
Wrong.
There ain't no egg.

03:05.357 --> 03:06.496
But you said...

03:06.634 --> 03:08.533
I said a rooster
went into the yard.

03:08.671 --> 03:10.120
Roosters don't
lay eggs!

03:20.476 --> 03:22.823
If you paid a dollar
for that riddle,

03:22.961 --> 03:26.136
then you just
laid an egg.

03:26.275 --> 03:27.517
Oh, yeah? Well,
you didn't get it.

03:27.655 --> 03:29.243
And neither will
Florence. Watch.

03:29.381 --> 03:31.901
Careful, George.
She won all the other bets.

03:32.039 --> 03:33.592
Oh, that's 'cause
she's just lucky, that's all.

03:33.730 --> 03:34.904
This time
I'm gonna nail her.

03:37.009 --> 03:39.046
Hey, hey,
Florence!
Hi.

03:39.184 --> 03:40.358
Mmm-hmm.

03:40.496 --> 03:42.291
Dinner sure
smells good.

03:42.429 --> 03:45.225
It'll smell even better
after I start cooking it.

03:47.330 --> 03:49.367
All you smell so far
is raw potatoes.

03:49.505 --> 03:50.989
Ah. Well,
I never smelled

03:51.127 --> 03:52.749
raw potatoes
that smelled better.

03:52.887 --> 03:54.475
What you up to?

03:54.613 --> 03:56.822
Nothing. I just came
to see how you were.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.308
Oh, by the way...

03:59.446 --> 04:00.723
I heard a good riddle today.

04:00.861 --> 04:02.449
You'll never get this one.

04:02.587 --> 04:04.002
I bet you I can.

04:04.140 --> 04:05.969
Okay. Five bucks
says you won't.

04:06.107 --> 04:07.626
Five bucks? Ain't that
a little high?

04:07.764 --> 04:09.249
What, are you
scared?

04:09.387 --> 04:12.873
Not as long as I'm still
playing with your money,
I ain't.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.428
You got yourself a bet.

04:16.566 --> 04:19.328
Okay. Now...

04:19.466 --> 04:21.295
...these two dudes live
next door to each other, see.

04:21.433 --> 04:23.124
Now one raises chickens,
the other one
hates chickens.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.712
One day a rooster
breaks into the yard

04:24.850 --> 04:26.921
of the guy who hates chickens
and lays an egg.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.923
The guy who hates chickens
claims the egg is his

04:29.061 --> 04:30.235
because it was laid
in his yard.

04:30.373 --> 04:31.823
Now the big
question is...

04:31.961 --> 04:34.170
Who owns the egg?

04:36.931 --> 04:38.795
That's a hard one.

04:38.933 --> 04:40.832
Yeah, I don't know
whose egg that is.

04:42.558 --> 04:43.593
Tough toenails.

04:43.731 --> 04:45.112
Because where
I come from,

04:45.250 --> 04:47.528
roosters don't
lay no eggs.

04:53.707 --> 04:54.777
Lord!

04:59.264 --> 05:02.129
Oh, woman,
you ain't so slick.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.994
Well, at least
you stumped me, George.

05:05.132 --> 05:06.409
One out of two
ain't bad.

05:06.547 --> 05:09.067
That Florence has got
a personality problem.

05:09.205 --> 05:10.758
No wonder people
don't like her.

05:12.726 --> 05:13.692
What people?

05:13.830 --> 05:15.660
Me.

05:15.798 --> 05:19.836
Oh, George, you're impossible.
I'm going up to see Helen.

05:19.974 --> 05:21.976
Oh, Florence, you can
put the dinner on now.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.840
I'll be back
in a couple of minutes.

05:23.978 --> 05:25.014
FLORENCE: Okay.

05:25.152 --> 05:26.602
Why do you have to go out now?

05:26.740 --> 05:29.363
I hate hanging around a loser.

05:32.504 --> 05:34.541
So long, Pop.
Wait a minute, Lionel.

05:34.679 --> 05:36.094
What's the
big hurry?

05:36.232 --> 05:38.372
I'm having dinner
with some of the guys
I work with.

05:38.510 --> 05:40.098
Oh. Nice bunch
of dudes, huh?

05:40.236 --> 05:42.272
Oh, the best, Pop,
and really bright too.

05:42.411 --> 05:45.379
Phi Beta Kappa, Ph.D...
Hey, I'd like to meet 'em.

05:45.517 --> 05:47.623
Why don't you
ask 'em up here
for a drink sometime?

05:47.761 --> 05:49.107
I will.

05:49.245 --> 05:50.626
Okay.
How about tonight?

05:50.764 --> 05:52.248
Um, not tonight, Pop,

05:52.386 --> 05:55.009
but, uh, maybe some
other time, okay?

05:55.147 --> 05:57.598
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

05:57.736 --> 05:58.979
Need any bucks?

05:59.117 --> 06:01.775
Um, Pop, I'm working now,
remember?

06:01.913 --> 06:03.363
Then how about
lending me a couple?

06:04.950 --> 06:06.366
Oh, uh, one more thing,
Lionel.

06:06.504 --> 06:07.470
What is it, Pop?

06:07.608 --> 06:08.713
I just want to tell you

06:08.851 --> 06:10.128
how I'm really proud
of you, son.

06:10.266 --> 06:11.543
I mean, the way
you're hanging around

06:11.681 --> 06:12.717
with all these
heavy dudes,

06:12.855 --> 06:14.166
and I never even
went to college.

06:14.304 --> 06:15.651
I know, Pop.

06:15.789 --> 06:17.584
Matter of fact,
I dropped out of
high school...

06:17.722 --> 06:19.102
Pop, I've really
gotta go now.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.863
Oh, yeah. Don't forget.
If it wasn't for me,

06:21.001 --> 06:22.623
you wouldn't have
that great head
on your shoulders.

06:22.761 --> 06:25.350
Um, didn't Mom
have a little
to do with that?

06:25.488 --> 06:27.248
No. 'Cause I'm the one
that had to do

06:27.387 --> 06:28.526
the punishing
when you was bad.

06:28.664 --> 06:30.148
And I never hit you
in the head.

06:30.286 --> 06:32.392
Only on the behind.

06:32.530 --> 06:34.290
All right!

06:37.224 --> 06:38.881
Got any more riddles,
Mr. Jefferson?

06:39.019 --> 06:40.330
Oh, you just lucky,
that's all.

06:40.469 --> 06:42.643
No, I ain't. I knew
the answer all the time.

06:42.781 --> 06:43.851
How?

06:43.989 --> 06:45.439
It was printed on
my bubble gum wrapper!

06:49.305 --> 06:51.997
You see that? You cheated!

06:53.723 --> 06:55.311
Ah, Mr. Jefferson,
I was wondering

06:55.449 --> 06:57.071
if you could cash
a small check for me.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.695
Not now, Bentley.
I'm busy.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.871
But I'll have
everything

07:04.009 --> 07:06.184
straightened out in a minute,
and then I'll cash your check.

07:06.322 --> 07:07.288
Ah.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.187
Uh...do you have
a good watch?

07:09.325 --> 07:11.638
For collateral?
No, no.

07:12.811 --> 07:15.538
In 60 seconds,
exactly 60 seconds,

07:15.676 --> 07:17.264
ring the doorbell,
okay?

07:17.402 --> 07:18.886
Roger.

07:19.024 --> 07:21.786
But, uh...would it be
presumptuous of me
to inquire why?

07:21.924 --> 07:22.994
Start counting.

07:30.691 --> 07:31.658
Yeah?

07:31.796 --> 07:33.280
Oh, Florence,

07:33.418 --> 07:34.730
I just wanted to
apologize to you.

07:34.868 --> 07:36.559
Is this for something
you did

07:36.697 --> 07:38.941
or something
you're gonna do?

07:39.079 --> 07:40.736
No, no, honest.

07:40.874 --> 07:42.669
Look, I've been under
a lot of stress lately,

07:42.807 --> 07:44.325
but I shouldn't
take it out on you.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.810
That's right.
You sure shouldn't.

07:45.948 --> 07:47.190
So, I'm sorry.

07:47.328 --> 07:50.504
You know...
I admire you.

07:50.642 --> 07:52.264
Watch yourself!

07:54.991 --> 07:56.199
Not that way.

07:56.337 --> 07:57.615
I mean, because
you're so lucky.

07:57.753 --> 07:58.892
I have never
in my life

07:59.030 --> 08:02.102
seen anybody with
so much pure luck as you.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.794
I bet you could close
your eyes right now
and think real hard,

08:04.932 --> 08:06.071
and guess who's
gonna be

08:06.209 --> 08:08.246
the next person
to come in
through that door.

08:08.384 --> 08:10.317
I don't know.
I guess I could.

08:10.455 --> 08:12.250
I got as good a chance
as anybody else.

08:12.388 --> 08:14.494
Better, 'cause
you so lucky. Huh.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.462
Hey, wanna try?

08:17.600 --> 08:20.085
You mean, bet on
who's the next one
to come through that door?

08:20.223 --> 08:22.432
Yeah.
For 10 bucks.

08:22.571 --> 08:24.538
And I get to pick first?
Anybody I want?

08:24.676 --> 08:26.402
Whoever you want.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.955
All right,
in that case...

08:28.093 --> 08:30.026
I pick Mrs. Jefferson.

08:30.164 --> 08:32.063
You sure was dumb
to let me pick first.

08:32.201 --> 08:35.307
I heard Mrs. Jefferson
say she'd be back
in a couple of minutes.

08:35.445 --> 08:36.826
Damn!

08:38.069 --> 08:39.657
What, me and
my big mouth!

08:39.795 --> 08:41.244
Oh, the bet's off.
Uh-uh, honey.

08:41.382 --> 08:43.315
A bet's a bet.

08:43.453 --> 08:45.801
Well...since I'm
gonna lose anyway,

08:45.939 --> 08:47.354
it don't matter
who I pick.

08:47.492 --> 08:50.253
So I'll pick,
uh, Bentley.

08:55.431 --> 08:56.812
Oh, hello.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.505
How are you,
Mr. Bentley?

09:00.643 --> 09:02.818
Just fine, Mrs. J.
After you.

09:02.956 --> 09:04.267
Oh, thank you.

09:12.137 --> 09:13.932
Weezy, what you
doing here?

09:16.176 --> 09:18.109
I live here,
remember?

09:18.247 --> 09:19.731
Don't you ever
do that again!

09:20.905 --> 09:23.183
Say goodbye.

09:24.909 --> 09:26.393
Harrumph.

09:26.531 --> 09:27.808
Uh, Mr. J,
I rang the bell

09:27.946 --> 09:29.189
at 60 seconds
on the nose.

09:29.327 --> 09:30.466
Now will you cash
my check?

09:30.604 --> 09:31.812
It's only $20.

09:31.950 --> 09:33.538
Here.
Thank you.

09:33.676 --> 09:35.160
Are you sure
it's all right?

09:35.298 --> 09:37.784
If I run short,
I'll go to Florence,
the Bank of Harlem.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.788
Did you lose another
bet to Florence?

09:41.926 --> 09:43.168
I don't want
to talk about that.

09:43.306 --> 09:44.514
Oh, well,
never mind.

09:44.653 --> 09:46.586
Jenny gave me something
that will cheer you up.

09:46.724 --> 09:48.864
What's that?
It's a little newsletter

09:49.002 --> 09:50.210
Lionel's company
puts out.

09:50.348 --> 09:52.419
There's a story in it
about their new employees.

09:52.557 --> 09:54.663
Look what they said
about Lionel.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.458
Hey, hey, hey.
Ain't that something?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.012
"One of our brighter

09:59.150 --> 10:00.841
"young engineers,
Lionel Jefferson."

10:00.979 --> 10:01.946
Imagine that, Weezy.

10:02.084 --> 10:04.362
Doesn't it make you
feel proud?

10:04.500 --> 10:05.639
Yeah.

10:05.777 --> 10:06.916
"Jefferson's father
is the

10:07.054 --> 10:09.091
"well-known businessman
George Jefferson,

10:09.229 --> 10:10.402
"president
of Jefferson Cleaners."

10:10.540 --> 10:12.612
Hey, hey! He gave me
a little free advertising.

10:15.131 --> 10:17.237
"Mr. Jefferson is
a graduate...

10:17.375 --> 10:18.790
"Cum-laude

10:18.928 --> 10:20.481
"of Harvard Business School."

10:21.517 --> 10:23.588
That ain't true.
I never went to college.

10:23.726 --> 10:25.970
Uh, let me see that.
I didn't read that far.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.939
Oh, Weezy,
why would Lionel
put me down like that?

10:30.077 --> 10:32.977
Saying you went to Harvard
is putting you down?

10:33.115 --> 10:34.357
He lied about me.

10:34.495 --> 10:36.394
Well, it's just a mistake.

10:36.532 --> 10:38.327
Lionel wouldn't do
a thing like that.

10:38.465 --> 10:41.537
Oh, no. Then how come
he showed it to Jenny
and didn't show it to us?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.470
Well, he just
happened to show it
to her first.

10:43.608 --> 10:45.196
I'm sure
he was gonna...
No, no.

10:45.334 --> 10:47.888
He was trying to hide it
because he didn't
want me to read it.

10:48.026 --> 10:49.062
Why?

10:50.270 --> 10:52.203
Because if I read it,
I'd find out.

10:52.341 --> 10:54.412
Find out what?

10:55.758 --> 10:57.242
Don't you get it, Weezy?

10:57.380 --> 10:59.003
My own son is ashamed of me.

11:08.150 --> 11:11.671
George, you're wrong.
Lionel's not ashamed
of you.

11:11.809 --> 11:14.156
Yes, he is.
Can't you read?

11:14.294 --> 11:16.468
He's ashamed 'cause
his father didn't
go to college

11:16.606 --> 11:18.263
and get one of them
come, lordies.

11:18.401 --> 11:21.819
I wouldn't even know
what a come, lordy was
if it bit me on the leg.

11:24.338 --> 11:25.754
It's cum laude,George,

11:25.892 --> 11:27.687
and I think it means
"with honors."

11:27.825 --> 11:30.862
See? I'm so dumb
I thought Come, Lordy
was a gospel song.

11:38.905 --> 11:41.770
George, you're not dumb.

11:41.908 --> 11:43.530
He don't even want me
to meet his buddies

11:43.668 --> 11:44.876
'cause he's afraid
I'll embarrass him.

11:45.014 --> 11:47.223
I take it back.
You are dumb.

11:47.361 --> 11:48.880
Look, Weezy, I know
what he's thinking.

11:49.018 --> 11:50.537
He's moving in real
fancy company now.

11:50.675 --> 11:52.608
And if they find out
his father didn't go
to college,

11:52.746 --> 11:53.851
they'll look down
on him.

11:53.989 --> 11:55.922
That's why he
ducked out on me today.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.302
You're imagining
things.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.546
What have you got
to be ashamed of?

11:59.684 --> 12:02.376
I keep telling you,
I didn't even finish
high school.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.725
Only because
you had to quit school
to support your mother.

12:05.863 --> 12:07.071
Yeah.

12:07.209 --> 12:09.038
I bet you I could have
graduated high school.

12:09.176 --> 12:10.557
Sure you could.

12:10.695 --> 12:13.940
And if I had me for a father,
I'd have graduated college.

12:14.078 --> 12:15.769
That's right.

12:15.907 --> 12:17.426
I'd have got me
a come, lordy,

12:17.564 --> 12:19.877
a go, lordy,
and a come-back-again lordy.

12:26.262 --> 12:29.024
And, of course,
you wouldn't have gone
around boasting about it.

12:29.162 --> 12:32.130
No. Only to
Lionel's friends.

12:32.268 --> 12:34.684
Trouble is, it's too late
for that now.

12:34.823 --> 12:37.204
There's no way
I can prove it to him.

12:37.342 --> 12:39.275
It wouldn't make
any difference to Lionel

12:39.413 --> 12:42.451
even if you got yourself
a high school diploma
right now.

12:42.589 --> 12:44.625
Now that's ridiculous.
How am I gonna do that?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.455
You could take
an equivalency test.

12:46.593 --> 12:47.732
A what?

12:47.870 --> 12:49.561
I was reading about it
in the paper.

12:49.699 --> 12:52.772
They've got tests
for adults who want
to get their diplomas.

12:54.256 --> 12:56.534
Hey...that's it!

12:56.672 --> 12:57.673
That's what
I'm gonna do.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.917
I'm gonna take
the test.
Oh.

13:00.055 --> 13:01.228
I'm gonna take the test!

13:01.366 --> 13:03.955
I'm gonna
take the test, Weezy!

13:04.093 --> 13:07.062
Oh, boy, I should have
kept my big mouth shut.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.339
No,
you shouldn't,

13:08.477 --> 13:10.375
because once a year,
you say something smart.

13:12.722 --> 13:16.071
You're not serious
about taking one of
those tests, are you?

13:16.209 --> 13:19.005
Sure I am. That way
I can prove to Lionel
what I could've done.

13:19.143 --> 13:20.420
Don't tell him
I'm taking the test.

13:20.558 --> 13:22.663
And don't you
say nothing
about it neither.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.253
That'll be easy,
'cause I don't know
what you talking about.

13:26.391 --> 13:28.531
Our George is gonna
take a test

13:28.669 --> 13:29.739
for his
high school diploma.

13:29.878 --> 13:31.707
Oh. And then
he's gonna grow up?

13:36.263 --> 13:38.887
He's trying to
prove something to Lionel.

13:39.025 --> 13:40.474
Oh, he can't pass that test.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.166
It's tough enough,
even for folks who know

13:42.304 --> 13:45.479
the difference between
a hen and a rooster.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.447
Yeah. I could have
got me a high
school diploma

13:47.585 --> 13:49.967
when I was a kid
and I can get me
one now.

13:50.105 --> 13:51.278
Oh, yeah?
You want to

13:51.416 --> 13:53.246
put your money where
your brains is, honey?

13:53.384 --> 13:55.248
Twenty bucks
says I can.

13:55.386 --> 13:56.387
Put up
or shut up.

13:56.525 --> 13:58.078
This is one bet
I know I can't lose.

13:58.216 --> 13:59.390
You'll never
learn.

13:59.528 --> 14:00.632
Who's gonna
hold the bet?

14:00.770 --> 14:02.393
Oh, I trust you.

14:02.531 --> 14:04.878
Like I said,
just put your money
where your brains is.

14:05.016 --> 14:06.190
In your
back pocket.

14:27.521 --> 14:28.971
Weezy!

14:30.904 --> 14:32.181
Don't you know
I'm over here

14:32.319 --> 14:34.080
beating my brains out
trying to learn this junk?

14:34.218 --> 14:35.633
Sure. What do you want?

14:35.771 --> 14:36.876
Stop cracking your knuckles!

14:43.158 --> 14:45.954
I'm not cracking my knuckles.
I'm cracking walnuts.

14:46.092 --> 14:47.576
Then don't.

14:47.714 --> 14:49.302
Well, how am I gonna eat them?

14:49.440 --> 14:52.305
If you loved me,
you'd eat 'em with
the shells on 'em.

14:54.341 --> 14:55.929
I'm sorry, George.

14:56.067 --> 14:57.344
Look, just hold it down, okay?

14:57.482 --> 14:59.105
These math problems
are murder.

15:30.412 --> 15:32.276
What the hell was that?

15:32.414 --> 15:33.622
I beg your pardon?

15:34.657 --> 15:35.796
You cracking nuts again?

15:35.935 --> 15:39.835
Do I look like
I'm cracking nuts?

15:39.973 --> 15:41.906
Come over here
and help me crack this.

15:42.044 --> 15:43.735
Listen...

15:46.704 --> 15:48.637
"If Jane bought
three blouses

15:48.775 --> 15:50.950
"at $1.98 each,

15:51.088 --> 15:53.711
"which were on sale
at 30 percent off,

15:53.849 --> 15:56.334
"and Sally spent
twice as much

15:56.472 --> 15:59.406
"buying five blouses
at their regular price,
how much..."

15:59.544 --> 16:01.132
Don't ask me that,
George.

16:01.270 --> 16:04.204
Those problems always
gave me a headache
when I was in school.

16:04.342 --> 16:06.241
I'll get that.

16:06.379 --> 16:07.828
I don't want nobody
to see me studying.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.416
Whoever it is,
get rid of 'em.

16:09.554 --> 16:11.108
And do it quietly!

16:18.701 --> 16:20.220
Hi, Louise.
Hi, girl.

16:20.358 --> 16:21.773
Oh, hi, Tom, Helen.

16:21.911 --> 16:23.603
We're on our way
to that new
Chinese restaurant,

16:23.741 --> 16:25.467
and we thought
you might like
to join us.

16:25.605 --> 16:26.675
Well, uh...

16:26.813 --> 16:28.021
Is something wrong?

16:28.159 --> 16:29.264
It's George.

16:29.402 --> 16:30.817
What's he
up to now?

16:30.955 --> 16:33.130
Uh, I can't
tell you,

16:33.268 --> 16:34.476
but I think
you'd better go.

16:34.614 --> 16:35.615
Where is he?

16:35.753 --> 16:36.685
In the kitchen.

16:36.823 --> 16:38.307
What's he
doing?

16:38.445 --> 16:40.378
Uh...cracking
walnuts.

16:40.516 --> 16:42.070
That's a switch.

16:42.208 --> 16:44.762
I always thought
George was the nut
who was cracked.

16:46.177 --> 16:47.765
That's not fair,
Helen.

16:47.903 --> 16:50.216
George is doing
something that's
very hard for him.

16:50.354 --> 16:52.321
Doesn't he have
a nutcracker?

16:56.187 --> 16:58.569
He's very touchy
right now,

16:58.707 --> 17:02.469
and you know
the effect you two
have on him sometimes.

17:02.607 --> 17:04.609
Okay, girl.
We'll leave quietly.

17:04.747 --> 17:07.474
Oh, I knew
you'd understand.

17:08.855 --> 17:10.098
Well, well!

17:10.236 --> 17:11.409
If it ain't the Willises!

17:11.547 --> 17:13.756
I thought
I heard you all
out here.

17:13.894 --> 17:15.413
Well, don't just
stand there, Weezy.

17:15.551 --> 17:16.518
Invite our friends in.

17:16.656 --> 17:18.796
Huh?
You know,
it's a shame.

17:18.934 --> 17:20.556
You all live
so close by,

17:20.694 --> 17:22.144
and we never hardly
ever see you all.

17:22.282 --> 17:24.664
We're neighbors,
and neighbors are supposed
to keep talking.

17:24.802 --> 17:26.631
Like, I was just
telling Weezy
a few minutes ago,

17:26.769 --> 17:28.633
how come
we don't see more
of Tom and Helen?

17:28.771 --> 17:30.256
Wasn't I, Weezy?

17:31.705 --> 17:33.466
Don't ask.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.268
Don't ask.

17:43.648 --> 17:45.581
Well, George,
what's on your mind?

17:45.719 --> 17:46.996
What do you want
to talk about?

17:47.135 --> 17:49.240
Ah! It's strange
you should ask that.

17:49.378 --> 17:51.311
I was just thinking.

17:53.037 --> 17:54.625
If Jane bought
three blouses

17:54.763 --> 17:57.973
at $1.98 each...

17:58.111 --> 17:59.492
Who's Jane?

17:59.630 --> 18:01.045
Did I say Jane?

18:01.183 --> 18:02.874
Oh, I didn't mean Jane.
I meant Weezy.

18:03.012 --> 18:05.463
Where'd you find
blouses for $1.98?

18:10.330 --> 18:12.746
I didn't buy
any blouses.
George was just...

18:12.884 --> 18:14.058
Look, you stay out of this,
Weezy.

18:14.196 --> 18:15.680
This doesn't
concern you.

18:15.818 --> 18:19.270
So, now,
she bought these blouses
at $1.98 each,

18:19.408 --> 18:21.755
which were on sale
at 30 percent off.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.344
This is what
you were thinking about
in the kitchen?

18:24.482 --> 18:26.519
Yeah. It's quieter
in there.

18:26.657 --> 18:28.831
It would
have to be.

18:28.969 --> 18:30.281
Look, George...
Hush up!

18:30.419 --> 18:33.491
Would you let me
finish telling you
what I got to say?

18:33.629 --> 18:37.426
Anyway, Sally paid
twice as much
for five blouses...

18:37.564 --> 18:38.945
Who's Sally?

18:40.567 --> 18:43.191
Sally, that's
Weezy's sister.

18:45.089 --> 18:47.264
Girl, I didn't know
you had a sister
named Sally.

18:47.402 --> 18:48.851
I don't.

18:48.989 --> 18:50.957
And where's
this store

18:51.095 --> 18:54.478
that Jane's buying
blouses for $1.98?

18:54.616 --> 18:56.928
You mean Weezy.
Well, whoever.

18:57.066 --> 18:58.344
Where's the store?

18:58.482 --> 18:59.793
How should I know?

18:59.931 --> 19:02.486
I ain't the one
buying the blouses.

19:03.866 --> 19:06.904
George, they're entitled
to some answers.

19:07.042 --> 19:08.526
I'm the one
that needs the answers!

19:08.664 --> 19:10.735
All I got is questions!

19:10.873 --> 19:11.909
Why are you yelling
at Louise?

19:12.047 --> 19:13.290
I think she's
perfectly wonderful,

19:13.428 --> 19:14.567
saving you money
like that.

19:14.705 --> 19:16.431
Look, if you're not
gonna cooperate,

19:16.569 --> 19:17.777
why did you come over here?

19:17.915 --> 19:19.365
To invite you
to dinner!

19:19.503 --> 19:20.607
See, that's
your trouble, Willis.

19:20.745 --> 19:21.884
You're always thinking
about your stomach.

19:22.022 --> 19:23.783
If there's two things
I can't stand,

19:23.921 --> 19:25.371
it's greedy,
selfish neighbors.

19:25.509 --> 19:27.787
I think
we'd better leave.

19:29.582 --> 19:31.446
Oh, hi, everybody.
What's happening?

19:32.205 --> 19:33.517
BOTH:
Don't ask.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.210
I'll talk
to you later.

19:39.454 --> 19:40.558
Where you going,
Lionel?

19:40.696 --> 19:41.732
Oh, to the kitchen.

19:41.870 --> 19:43.182
Mom, is any of
that potato pie left?

19:43.320 --> 19:45.563
Don't go in the kitchen.
Your father's in there.

19:45.701 --> 19:47.979
Well, that's okay, Ma.
He can have some pie too.

19:48.117 --> 19:50.741
He's in there
studying and he doesn't
want you to know.

19:50.879 --> 19:53.122
What's he studying?
Playboy?

19:54.710 --> 19:56.781
He's studying for
his high school diploma.

19:56.919 --> 19:58.749
Pop? Why?

19:59.681 --> 20:01.579
Well, now,
don't laugh.

20:01.717 --> 20:05.514
He's got
the crazy notion
that you're ashamed of him.

20:07.447 --> 20:09.277
You're not laughing.

20:09.415 --> 20:10.795
You know, I don't think
I'm really hungry.

20:10.933 --> 20:12.349
Maybe I'll just
catch up on my books.

20:12.487 --> 20:13.522
Uh, Lionel.

20:14.316 --> 20:16.249
It is crazy,
isn't it?

20:18.251 --> 20:19.528
No, it's not crazy.

20:20.598 --> 20:22.980
You're ashamed
of your father?

20:23.981 --> 20:25.948
I'm ashamed of me.

20:26.086 --> 20:28.088
I guess you saw
the newsletter, huh?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.780
Yes. I borrowed it
from Jenny.

20:29.918 --> 20:31.575
Oh.

20:32.507 --> 20:33.887
Ma...

20:35.441 --> 20:37.270
Ma, the reporter...

20:37.408 --> 20:39.548
Well, the reporter
from the newsletter

20:39.686 --> 20:41.757
interviewed me along
with the other new guys

20:41.895 --> 20:44.070
at the same time.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.693
He asked them all
what colleges
their dads went to.

20:46.831 --> 20:48.177
Well, Ma,
they're all

20:48.316 --> 20:51.250
Phi Beta Kappas, Ph.D.s,
stuff like that.

20:51.388 --> 20:53.079
Well, so when he
asked me

20:53.217 --> 20:56.531
where my father graduated,
then I told him Harvard.

20:57.117 --> 20:58.740
It just
slipped out.

20:59.844 --> 21:01.743
And you lied
just like that?

21:02.847 --> 21:05.022
I told myself
I was doing it
for Pop's sake.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.265
How?

21:06.403 --> 21:07.576
Well, you know.

21:07.714 --> 21:10.545
Making him look as good
as any of the others.

21:10.683 --> 21:12.478
Yeah, I know
that wasn't really it.

21:12.616 --> 21:14.445
I was doing it
for my sake.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.136
For one split second,

21:16.275 --> 21:18.138
I was really
ashamed of him.

21:19.174 --> 21:21.418
Just for
one split second?

21:21.556 --> 21:23.385
Yeah.

21:23.523 --> 21:24.593
So, how come
you didn't want him

21:24.731 --> 21:26.250
to meet
your new buddies
the other day?

21:26.388 --> 21:28.390
Were you afraid
he would embarrass you?

21:28.528 --> 21:31.082
Oh, no.
See, I was afraid
they would tell him

21:31.220 --> 21:32.532
about the story
in the newsletter.

21:32.670 --> 21:34.120
Well, not that
it matters.

21:34.258 --> 21:36.398
He found out
anyway.

21:36.536 --> 21:38.676
Oh, Ma,
what am I gonna do?

21:39.850 --> 21:42.508
You are going in there
and straighten things out.

21:42.646 --> 21:44.475
He's knocking
his brains out,

21:44.613 --> 21:46.408
so you'll be
proud of him.

21:46.546 --> 21:48.479
Well, I am proud
of him.

21:48.617 --> 21:50.688
Then tell him so!

21:58.386 --> 21:59.490
Hi, Pop!

21:59.628 --> 22:01.389
Lionel!
Who let you in?

22:07.326 --> 22:08.603
Um...

22:12.020 --> 22:13.918
I have my own key,
remember?

22:14.056 --> 22:16.473
Um, would you like
some potato pie?

22:16.611 --> 22:18.854
No. No, thanks.

22:21.201 --> 22:22.444
What you doing
in the kitchen?

22:22.582 --> 22:24.377
Nothing.
I was just thinking.

22:24.515 --> 22:25.861
Oh.

22:27.415 --> 22:30.003
You know,
I've been doing
some thinking too.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.420
You know those guys
from work I was
telling you about?

22:32.558 --> 22:35.008
Oh, your
new buddies. Yeah.

22:35.146 --> 22:38.115
Well, um,
we're going out again
on Friday night.

22:38.253 --> 22:40.289
That's nice.

22:40.428 --> 22:42.706
I thought I'd ask 'em
up here first
for a drink.

22:42.844 --> 22:44.501
You know, to meet
you and Mom.

22:45.881 --> 22:46.951
Say what?

22:47.089 --> 22:48.436
You want 'em
to meet me?

22:48.574 --> 22:50.092
Well, sure I do.

22:50.230 --> 22:52.647
You're my dad, and...
And I'm proud of you.

22:52.785 --> 22:54.027
You are?

22:54.165 --> 22:55.926
Oh, you better
believe it.

22:56.064 --> 22:57.721
Hey, um,

22:57.859 --> 22:58.929
what's this?

22:59.067 --> 23:00.517
Oh, uh...

23:00.655 --> 23:02.760
That's just something
I was studying.

23:02.898 --> 23:04.693
Hmm.
What for?

23:04.831 --> 23:07.144
Well, I was thinking
about taking my
high school test.

23:07.282 --> 23:09.491
You know, for the
high school diploma
which I didn't get.

23:09.629 --> 23:11.286
Are you jiving?

23:11.424 --> 23:12.908
Now, what would a guy
with your smarts

23:13.046 --> 23:15.014
need a diploma to prove
how clever he is?

23:15.152 --> 23:17.465
Man, you've already
proved it where
it counts.

23:17.603 --> 23:19.259
You think so?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.709
I know so.

23:20.847 --> 23:22.331
You know, most of
those college dudes

23:22.470 --> 23:24.092
couldn't do half
of what you've done.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.887
Ha! That's true.

23:28.993 --> 23:29.925
I mean,
you know,

23:30.063 --> 23:31.375
go on studying
if you want to,

23:31.513 --> 23:34.447
but, um, I think
it's a waste of time.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.451
So do I!

23:38.589 --> 23:39.625
Ha!

23:40.936 --> 23:43.836
Look, no more jokes
about me going to
Harvard, okay?

23:45.285 --> 23:47.115
No more...jokes.

23:47.805 --> 23:49.255
I promise, Pop.

23:49.393 --> 23:51.568
Hey, all right.

23:51.706 --> 23:54.191
Weezy! I ain't gotta
take the test no more.

23:54.329 --> 23:56.365
You don't? Why not?

23:56.504 --> 23:58.609
Because Lionel's
bringing his buddies
up here.

23:58.747 --> 23:59.817
He is?

23:59.955 --> 24:01.025
Mmm-hmm. And like
he was saying,

24:01.163 --> 24:03.096
I ain't got to prove
nothing to nobody.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.823
So ain't no reason
for me to take
the examination.

24:09.724 --> 24:11.657
Well...

24:15.350 --> 24:17.110
Back to
the damn books.

24:42.964 --> 24:46.968
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
