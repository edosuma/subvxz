01:21.675 --> 01:23.966
-Enjoy.
-If it's this season…

01:25.216 --> 01:26.591
That goes outside.

01:26.675 --> 01:27.716
Got it.

01:29.508 --> 01:30.883
Thank you.

01:32.508 --> 01:33.341
Morning.

01:33.425 --> 01:36.133
It's also good for storing genomes.

01:39.966 --> 01:41.466
SPANISH GRAMMAR

01:52.675 --> 01:55.091
MOVING CENTER

01:55.675 --> 01:57.550
Thanks for your help.

02:38.341 --> 02:41.758
How was the dive yesterday, Tsuneo?

02:42.675 --> 02:44.550
I saw a Priolepis nocturna.

02:44.633 --> 02:46.633
That's awesome!

02:46.716 --> 02:49.716
I was lucky the sea was so calm.

02:51.133 --> 02:54.008
You're on summer break from college?

02:54.591 --> 02:55.425
That's right.

02:56.008 --> 02:59.341
How about doing a dive next Wednesday?

02:59.425 --> 03:00.258
Sure!

03:01.341 --> 03:03.258
Bring some girls too.

03:03.341 --> 03:04.425
Sorry?

03:05.008 --> 03:08.383
At this rate, fish will be our only love.

03:08.466 --> 03:11.258
But I long for a human one. Right, Tsuneo?

03:11.841 --> 03:13.175
No time for that.

03:13.883 --> 03:16.508
I start another part-time job next week.

03:17.758 --> 03:20.508
You're wasting your youth.

03:20.591 --> 03:23.300
The summer of 22 comes only once.

03:23.883 --> 03:25.133
Whatever.

03:25.216 --> 03:26.675
Tsuneo!

03:28.341 --> 03:29.841
Thank you.

03:33.091 --> 03:36.841
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

03:40.508 --> 03:42.258
Is this the right way?

03:42.925 --> 03:45.175
Help!

04:09.300 --> 04:10.591
That hurts.

04:13.175 --> 04:15.466
Are you okay?

04:23.591 --> 04:25.050
Kumiko!

04:25.633 --> 04:28.300
Kumiko, are you all right?

04:34.758 --> 04:38.050
Did you save her, young man? Thank you.

04:38.133 --> 04:38.966
No.

04:39.966 --> 04:41.716
Are you injured?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.383
I think I'm fine.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.925
I turn away for one second,
and someone pushes her.

04:48.633 --> 04:50.966
I almost had a heart attack.

04:51.716 --> 04:54.300
That hurts! Why did you do that?

04:54.383 --> 04:55.425
Pervert.

04:55.508 --> 04:56.341
What?

04:56.425 --> 04:59.508
Stop groping me, you pervert!

05:06.633 --> 05:09.175
The pervert is following us, Grandma.

05:10.716 --> 05:12.175
My house is this way.

05:15.091 --> 05:16.133
Shall I push?

05:16.216 --> 05:17.050
No.

05:22.216 --> 05:23.425
Born this way.

05:26.925 --> 05:29.050
What about our walk, Grandma?

05:29.133 --> 05:33.175
We're giving up walks for a while.

05:33.258 --> 05:34.383
I don't want to.

05:34.466 --> 05:38.466
Tough. You can't have everything your way.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.383
Do you always take walks at this hour?

05:45.425 --> 05:49.966
I thought it'd be safer
and we wouldn't be seen.

05:50.841 --> 05:54.175
But the world is full of scary beasts.

05:56.050 --> 05:56.925
Here we are.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.383
I'll be going.

06:10.883 --> 06:11.925
Come on in.

06:13.216 --> 06:15.425
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

06:21.216 --> 06:22.091
Oh, drat.

06:22.675 --> 06:25.050
Would octopus dumplings do?

06:25.133 --> 06:27.008
We're out of rice.

06:27.675 --> 06:28.508
That's fine.

06:39.508 --> 06:40.883
Not you again.

06:41.550 --> 06:43.550
I keep putting him out but he returns.

06:44.175 --> 06:47.675
Don't touch it, Kumiko. It may have fleas.

06:47.758 --> 06:48.591
Scat!

06:50.216 --> 06:52.300
Just here for some free food.

06:52.841 --> 06:55.050
Do you feed him often?

06:55.633 --> 06:56.591
I meant you.

06:59.883 --> 07:02.966
No, he's not a friend. Just a pervert.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.425
He understands you.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.883
Of course not. Are you stupid?

07:10.925 --> 07:13.425
"You're intruding on my territory."

07:13.508 --> 07:14.591
That's what he said.

07:16.341 --> 07:17.216
Ms. Kumiko…

07:17.300 --> 07:18.466
Josee.

07:18.550 --> 07:19.633
What?

07:20.216 --> 07:22.508
I'm not Kumiko. I'm Josee.

07:23.091 --> 07:23.925
Josee?

07:33.758 --> 07:34.591
With thanks.

07:42.008 --> 07:43.341
Have seconds.

07:44.341 --> 07:49.508
Thank you. I can't afford
to buy another box lunch.

07:49.591 --> 07:52.550
You sound very poor. Are you a student?

07:53.175 --> 07:56.050
Yes, I rent an apartment nearby.

07:56.633 --> 08:01.258
I'm poor, but I'm also trying
to save money.

08:01.341 --> 08:02.883
Nobody's asking.

08:04.133 --> 08:06.175
I'm thirsty, Grandma.

08:06.258 --> 08:08.175
Barley tea or water?

08:08.258 --> 08:09.925
-Barley tea.
-Okay.

08:10.008 --> 08:12.091
Just a second.

08:12.175 --> 08:13.716
Allow me.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.633
It's okay. Don't let your food get cold.

08:18.216 --> 08:19.216
Is this it?

08:22.300 --> 08:23.300
Here.

08:24.550 --> 08:25.925
You're pretty demanding.

08:26.591 --> 08:28.466
Ouch, that's hot!

08:32.383 --> 08:33.591
What's the deal?

08:34.591 --> 08:38.050
Kumiko can't hold onto tea in a cup.

08:39.008 --> 08:42.800
How about a plastic bottle? Or a thermos.

08:44.008 --> 08:45.425
You're a funny young man.

08:47.466 --> 08:49.008
Thank you for the meal.

08:49.633 --> 08:51.175
Sorry for staying so long.

08:51.258 --> 08:54.466
Nonsense. We don't often have guests.

08:54.550 --> 08:55.383
Goodbye.

08:58.425 --> 09:01.133
Do you want to earn some money?

09:03.008 --> 09:04.300
A new job?

09:04.883 --> 09:07.841
Yeah, someone I happened to meet.

09:07.925 --> 09:09.508
It pays really well.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.883
What about this job?

09:12.466 --> 09:13.800
I'll continue, of course.

09:15.591 --> 09:18.675
Where's the joy in working so much?

09:18.758 --> 09:22.550
I can introduce you too. She's a female.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.091
-Seriously?
-Yes.

09:24.175 --> 09:25.966
About 80 years old.

09:26.050 --> 09:27.216
Figures.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.050
Move those hands, Hayato.

09:30.133 --> 09:31.216
Yes, boss.

09:33.091 --> 09:34.966
Have you seen the toolbox?

09:35.550 --> 09:39.508
Yeah, the lid needed fixing.

09:39.591 --> 09:40.466
Hey, thanks!

09:42.841 --> 09:47.091
I might even hire you full-time
when you graduate.

09:47.175 --> 09:48.883
I'll think about it.

09:48.966 --> 09:51.800
Not you. I meant Tsuneo Suzukawa here.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.758
I plan to study abroad after college.

09:56.841 --> 10:01.550
Didn't you know, boss?
He's going to the Netherlands.

10:01.633 --> 10:02.883
It's Mexico.

10:02.966 --> 10:07.758
Ah, Mexico. I once swam
with a baby sea lion in La Paz.

10:08.550 --> 10:12.508
Study abroad, huh?
We're going to miss you.

10:13.091 --> 10:15.841
I haven't found a school yet.

10:15.925 --> 10:21.008
And he hasn't saved enough.
You should raise his wages.

10:21.091 --> 10:22.633
Mine too, while you're at it.

10:22.716 --> 10:24.508
Go check the machines.

10:24.591 --> 10:25.966
Right away, sir!

10:27.591 --> 10:29.050
What's wrong, Mai?

10:29.133 --> 10:34.341
Nothing. Well, tell me
about that job that pays so well.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.966
You are to do as Kumiko says.

10:37.925 --> 10:38.758
What?

10:38.841 --> 10:40.633
Didn't I tell you?

10:40.716 --> 10:45.050
No, you didn't.
You mean I'd be working here?

10:45.716 --> 10:47.758
Yes, you'd be working here.

10:50.508 --> 10:53.008
Don't look so disappointed.

10:53.091 --> 10:57.633
There's only one rule.
Don't take her out on your own.

10:58.383 --> 11:00.758
Help yourself to anything in the fridge.

11:01.425 --> 11:02.883
There's plenty.

11:03.550 --> 11:07.050
I have to go.
Kumiko will tell you what to do.

11:07.675 --> 11:09.175
Where are you going?

11:20.300 --> 11:21.133
Well… hello.

11:22.925 --> 11:23.925
What do I do?

11:26.550 --> 11:27.425
Joan, was it?

11:27.508 --> 11:28.383
It's Josee!

11:33.341 --> 11:34.758
-Josee?
-Stay away.

11:39.550 --> 11:42.300
"Intruders get out", he says.

11:43.175 --> 11:46.175
But I'm working here from today.

11:47.925 --> 11:49.008
-Kneel.
-What?

11:49.508 --> 11:50.550
On your knees.

11:52.258 --> 11:53.091
Okay, I'm kneeling.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.675
Do you want to live?

12:01.633 --> 12:03.925
Why am I kneeling?

12:04.008 --> 12:07.091
To see how long a human can endure it.

12:08.216 --> 12:09.841
Do your job well.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.133
I'm going to make her cry.

12:17.216 --> 12:21.050
Your look has really changed
in the past month.

12:21.633 --> 12:24.383
Is working for this Josee that hard?

12:24.466 --> 12:26.550
It's way beyond hard.

12:27.216 --> 12:28.633
Count the meshes in the tatami mats.

12:30.008 --> 12:33.133
It keeps me up at night wondering.

12:34.258 --> 12:37.633
5,208, 5,209, 5,210,

12:38.216 --> 12:41.216
5,211, 5,212…

12:41.300 --> 12:43.633
Oh, what a waste.

12:44.258 --> 12:47.966
I squandered 8,000 yen
on a bad pachinko machine.

12:48.050 --> 12:51.466
8,001, 8,002, 8,003… Oops.

12:51.550 --> 12:53.008
Start over.

12:56.091 --> 12:58.425
Bring me four-leaf clovers.

12:59.883 --> 13:02.425
Four-leaf clovers.

13:03.008 --> 13:05.675
Four-leaf clovers…

13:06.633 --> 13:07.966
Here.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.508
Nothing's happening.

13:12.175 --> 13:14.758
Ten are supposed to grant my wish.

13:14.841 --> 13:15.883
Superstition.

13:16.550 --> 13:17.800
What wish?

13:17.883 --> 13:20.216
Don't speak to me. I'm busy.

13:23.925 --> 13:26.341
She looks so meek

13:26.425 --> 13:30.341
until she speaks
and becomes a stinging jellyfish.

13:30.925 --> 13:34.466
I'd like to glue her
to one of her sliding doors.

13:34.550 --> 13:36.008
Oh, harsh.

13:36.091 --> 13:40.883
Why don't you quit?
You need to write your thesis.

13:41.716 --> 13:44.258
But I really need the money.

13:44.341 --> 13:47.050
You don't have to earn it there.

13:47.633 --> 13:50.508
Even if your hours
at the shop are decreasing.

13:51.591 --> 13:53.883
Stop thinking about making a buck

13:53.966 --> 13:57.050
and give some attention to Mai.

13:57.758 --> 13:59.300
Eat this and shut up.

14:03.091 --> 14:04.633
Is Tsuneo here?

14:05.341 --> 14:06.175
Professor!

14:06.841 --> 14:09.716
There you are. Can you spare a second?

14:11.758 --> 14:14.300
Your essay on Turing Patterns.

14:15.008 --> 14:19.216
I sent it to a professor
at Mexico City University.

14:19.300 --> 14:23.216
He loved it and wants you to study there.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.508
Thank you!

14:25.300 --> 14:28.550
That leaves the question of a scholarship.

14:28.633 --> 14:32.133
It'll be hard to pay your own way.

14:32.716 --> 14:34.425
I'll study Spanish harder,

14:34.508 --> 14:38.966
and rewrite my research proposal.

14:39.050 --> 14:41.550
Okay, don't push yourself too hard.

14:41.633 --> 14:43.800
You'll need your health.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.258
Otherwise, all will be lost.

14:47.633 --> 14:48.466
Okay.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.591
I thought you were asleep.

16:28.508 --> 16:32.133
Grandma, can we resume our walks?

16:32.216 --> 16:33.091
No.

16:33.675 --> 16:35.925
What if you get pushed again?

16:36.508 --> 16:39.841
Can you protect yourself?

16:41.091 --> 16:42.675
Listen to me. The world…

16:43.258 --> 16:45.425
-is full of scary beasts.
-Is full of scary beasts.

16:45.925 --> 16:47.508
Yes, I know that.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.300
Then be content to stay home.

16:58.675 --> 17:02.425
I envy you. Free to go where you choose.

17:07.091 --> 17:09.008
Nothing will happen from waiting.

17:23.925 --> 17:24.800
Hello!

17:39.716 --> 17:43.425
I'll miss the money, but Hayato is right.

17:50.508 --> 17:52.925
Listen, I've come to a decision.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.550
I need to quit this job.

18:01.008 --> 18:01.841
Are you listening?

18:37.216 --> 18:38.675
Kumiko!

18:40.675 --> 18:42.300
Kumiko!

18:44.550 --> 18:45.925
What's wrong?

18:46.008 --> 18:48.050
Kumiko is missing!

19:03.300 --> 19:04.133
Stop!

19:05.425 --> 19:06.925
What are you doing?

19:07.550 --> 19:09.258
None of your business!

19:11.800 --> 19:13.341
Let me go!

19:17.175 --> 19:18.216
What, by yourself?

19:29.591 --> 19:31.341
-Let's call it a day.
-Take me.

19:33.383 --> 19:35.008
Take me to the sea.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.216
Or I'll say you
groped my breasts and get you fired.

19:41.550 --> 19:44.341
Do what you want. I'm going home.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.508
This will cost extra.

20:09.383 --> 20:10.800
280 yen.

20:11.758 --> 20:14.300
For the ticket. I've got a railcard.

20:15.716 --> 20:16.550
Is something wrong?

20:16.633 --> 20:18.175
No, it's nothing.

20:20.091 --> 20:23.966
It's Tsuneo. I've found Kumiko.

20:25.716 --> 20:26.550
Excuse me.

20:35.591 --> 20:40.216
I'll have her back
as soon as I can. Please understand.

20:44.841 --> 20:45.966
-Tiger.
-What?

20:46.675 --> 20:47.925
Tigers everywhere.

20:48.008 --> 20:49.216
Tigers?

20:52.925 --> 20:53.883
Hey.

20:53.966 --> 20:55.008
Where to now?

20:55.091 --> 20:55.925
Home.

20:56.716 --> 20:58.425
What about the sea?

20:59.008 --> 21:00.550
You were so insistent.

21:02.091 --> 21:03.550
Watch where you're going!

21:04.133 --> 21:06.258
What? She bumped into me.

21:09.425 --> 21:12.466
Are you serious? What a jerk.

21:13.591 --> 21:15.008
Hey, watch it!!

21:15.091 --> 21:15.925
Yes, Granny.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.091
Mess with me and I'll rip out your heart

21:19.175 --> 21:20.258
and feed it to you!

21:21.258 --> 21:22.091
Sorry!

21:30.925 --> 21:33.258
What do you want to do, Ms. Josee?

21:34.091 --> 21:35.758
Are we going or not?

21:46.591 --> 21:47.425
Be careful.

21:52.508 --> 21:53.508
Not there?

21:53.591 --> 21:54.925
No, it's this way.

21:55.008 --> 21:56.175
Really?

21:58.258 --> 21:59.841
Now, where's the elevator?

22:00.466 --> 22:02.425
Why are there so many people?

22:02.508 --> 22:03.841
Beats me.

22:12.633 --> 22:15.466
It's not my first time on a train.

22:17.383 --> 22:18.925
Stop staring.

22:19.008 --> 22:23.508
No, I was just wondering
how you see the world.

22:25.216 --> 22:28.216
Forests, deserts, New York, Paris…

22:28.883 --> 22:31.091
I've never imagined them that way.

22:32.258 --> 22:34.008
The way you drew them.

22:34.091 --> 22:36.216
You went into my room?

22:36.800 --> 22:39.716
I'd like to see an ocean like that.

22:45.550 --> 22:47.591
Pretty cocky for a servant.

22:48.466 --> 22:49.508
A servant?

22:49.591 --> 22:52.591
From today, you're "My Servant."

22:52.675 --> 22:53.758
What is that?

22:54.716 --> 22:55.800
Look! An airplane!

22:55.883 --> 22:59.466
Really? Where? Point it out to me.

23:41.883 --> 23:43.050
It's like a dream.

23:53.216 --> 23:55.050
Give it up. It's sand.

23:57.716 --> 23:58.550
You okay?

24:00.091 --> 24:01.550
Take it easy.

24:04.883 --> 24:05.716
Hey!

24:07.800 --> 24:09.550
I need an answer.

24:11.175 --> 24:16.966
My dad once asked me,
"How does the sea taste?"

24:18.675 --> 24:23.508
When I was a child,
he took me to the ocean.

24:24.341 --> 24:27.675
But the waves were too scary to get near.

24:29.633 --> 24:34.216
My dad died without
ever telling me the answer to it.

24:36.591 --> 24:41.508
Of course, I learned
from books that the sea is salty.

24:43.341 --> 24:46.133
But this may be
my only chance to confirm it.

24:57.175 --> 24:59.300
What are you doing?

24:59.383 --> 25:02.341
Put me down, you pervert!

25:02.966 --> 25:04.675
You want to see for yourself?

25:16.175 --> 25:17.008
Salty.

25:19.675 --> 25:21.258
It really is salty!

25:21.841 --> 25:23.341
Why is it so salty?

25:24.091 --> 25:25.258
I'm happy for you.

25:28.633 --> 25:30.008
Hey, stay still!

25:30.091 --> 25:31.716
It's really salty!

25:43.300 --> 25:44.508
Stop!

25:49.966 --> 25:52.091
NO GOING OUT!

25:52.675 --> 25:55.466
You said you'd come right back.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.966
Do it again, and you'll lose this.

26:01.716 --> 26:02.550
Sorry.

26:10.841 --> 26:12.133
Why did you come with me?

26:16.133 --> 26:19.883
I have a weakness
for anyone longing for the sea.

26:21.425 --> 26:24.883
I love seeing schools of fish swimming,

26:24.966 --> 26:26.258
so I often go diving.

26:27.341 --> 26:29.383
I even work at a diving shop.

26:30.591 --> 26:32.383
You've swum underwater?

26:32.966 --> 26:34.175
Alongside real fish?

26:34.966 --> 26:35.800
Yeah.

26:37.091 --> 26:38.383
Wow.

26:41.466 --> 26:44.758
Tell me, are there
other places you want to go?

26:47.425 --> 26:51.008
Grandma takes a nap between one and three.

27:29.758 --> 27:31.800
First crepe ever?

27:33.383 --> 27:36.258
No, I've eaten many with my boyfriends.

27:37.550 --> 27:39.091
I'm popular with boys.

27:39.175 --> 27:41.758
I've had five boyfriends at once.

27:41.841 --> 27:42.716
Sure.

27:53.008 --> 27:54.300
Ready and…

28:02.258 --> 28:03.091
You okay?

28:06.800 --> 28:09.300
So many different blues!

28:11.633 --> 28:12.675
Let's ride that!

28:12.758 --> 28:14.300
No, wait!

28:14.383 --> 28:15.425
Hurry up!

28:16.008 --> 28:19.216
This is amazing! Where's my house?

28:19.300 --> 28:22.300
Osaka Castle? Tell me, My Servant.

28:26.050 --> 28:27.508
Afraid of heights?

28:43.216 --> 28:44.133
There.

28:45.008 --> 28:48.050
Guess what, Grandma. I made dinner.

28:48.133 --> 28:49.091
You what?

28:51.425 --> 28:53.300
Yukichi, come here.

28:54.091 --> 28:55.133
Yukichi?

28:56.133 --> 28:57.258
Yeah, I named him.

28:57.341 --> 28:58.216
Well, you can't!

28:59.091 --> 29:01.800
-Make this chair two millimeters higher.
-What?

29:09.091 --> 29:10.508
That wasn't bad.

29:10.591 --> 29:11.800
Like I told you.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.175
Stop that!

29:21.841 --> 29:23.633
Easy.

29:30.050 --> 29:32.633
Slow down!

29:37.300 --> 29:39.175
We're in the sea.

29:39.800 --> 29:40.925
A seal!

29:41.008 --> 29:42.425
California sea lion.

29:43.008 --> 29:44.091
It's got horns.

29:44.175 --> 29:45.300
It's a Naso unicornis.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.175
Look at the big one!

29:47.258 --> 29:48.341
Whale shark.

29:48.925 --> 29:50.175
What's that group?

29:50.258 --> 29:51.300
Horse mackerel.

29:51.966 --> 29:54.050
One type sticks to reefs,

29:54.133 --> 29:57.383
but another type swims in the open seas.

29:57.466 --> 30:00.216
The latter form unique schools

30:00.300 --> 30:02.925
at middle to low ocean depths.

30:03.008 --> 30:05.341
They differ in shape, color, and habitat.

30:05.425 --> 30:08.508
Gold and black mackerel stick to reefs.

30:08.591 --> 30:10.800
Rockfish take to the open sea.

30:27.633 --> 30:30.341
It's a job opportunity for Kumiko.

30:30.425 --> 30:32.175
You're as pesky as the rest.

30:34.050 --> 30:36.925
She must be able
to live an independent life.

30:37.008 --> 30:40.800
You're supposed to support, not lecture.

30:40.883 --> 30:43.591
I'm sick and tired of hearing that.

30:45.341 --> 30:48.091
Keeping her confined to the home

30:48.175 --> 30:50.675
is not in her best interests.

30:51.591 --> 30:55.716
I'd bet her departed parents
are worried too.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.258
What do you know?

30:59.633 --> 31:02.633
I refuse to take Kumiko outside.

31:05.216 --> 31:08.508
But she goes out a lot lately.

31:09.466 --> 31:12.425
She thinks I don't know.

31:12.508 --> 31:13.550
By herself?

31:16.091 --> 31:19.966
I honestly didn't think
he'd take her to places.

31:20.050 --> 31:21.550
I was flabbergasted.

31:22.133 --> 31:25.258
You'd be surprised if you saw her now.

31:25.758 --> 31:28.925
She looks like that Glico billboard.

31:29.008 --> 31:29.841
Sorry?

31:32.883 --> 31:35.633
Ready to take off at a sprint.

31:39.508 --> 31:42.341
MACARTHUR'S ASSASSIN
RED SEA

31:43.716 --> 31:44.966
It's a sea of books.

32:00.675 --> 32:01.508
"Josee"?

32:04.341 --> 32:05.633
Oh, it's you, My Servant.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.966
Does that say "Josee"?

32:08.925 --> 32:10.925
It's the main character's name.

32:12.300 --> 32:14.216
Francoise Sagan.

32:15.966 --> 32:18.550
That's the sequel to this one,

32:18.633 --> 32:21.633
the conclusion I've longed to read.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.091
Hmm, it'll put me to sleep.

32:26.383 --> 32:29.258
I wouldn't expect a boorish servant

32:29.341 --> 32:30.508
to understand Sagan.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.800
Go borrow these.

32:34.466 --> 32:35.966
We need a library card.

32:37.633 --> 32:39.800
LOST PROFILE

32:41.341 --> 32:42.925
First time?

32:44.508 --> 32:46.758
Please fill out this form.

32:51.508 --> 32:53.091
Do you like Sagan?

33:00.633 --> 33:01.966
So do I!

33:02.050 --> 33:03.883
Which is your favorite?

33:06.800 --> 33:10.383
Sorry, I never meet other Sagan fans.

33:10.466 --> 33:11.758
I got a little excited.

33:14.550 --> 33:17.133
Those Without Shadows.

33:18.008 --> 33:19.466
Cool.

33:20.050 --> 33:23.633
Have you read The Unmade Bed?
The protagonist is Beatrice

33:23.716 --> 33:25.841
-from Those Without Shadows.
-Josee, borrow them both.

33:27.383 --> 33:28.216
Boyfriend?

33:29.050 --> 33:31.800
He called you "Josee." How wonderful.

33:34.008 --> 33:37.008
No! He's not my boyfriend or anything!

33:38.008 --> 33:39.800
She wouldn't waste time on me.

33:40.341 --> 33:42.091
Boys like her.

33:42.175 --> 33:44.425
She had five boyfriends at once.

33:44.508 --> 33:46.591
Shut up. I'll beat you senseless.

33:50.091 --> 33:53.341
But I'd like to read
the book you were mentioning.

33:53.425 --> 33:54.925
Yes, about Beatrice.

33:58.341 --> 33:59.883
You made a friend.

34:00.508 --> 34:01.383
A friend?

34:01.966 --> 34:03.175
The librarian.

34:03.258 --> 34:06.091
Kana and I are already friends?

34:06.175 --> 34:07.883
It looked like it to me.

34:14.883 --> 34:17.550
Kana and I are the same age.

34:18.341 --> 34:20.008
How old is that?

34:20.091 --> 34:21.008
Twenty-four.

34:21.091 --> 34:22.300
What? You're older…

34:23.258 --> 34:28.008
I mean, wow.
So you and Kana are the same age?

34:29.133 --> 34:30.800
It must be amazing to talk

34:31.508 --> 34:33.883
to a lot of people every day.

34:34.508 --> 34:36.300
You get used to it.

34:36.883 --> 34:40.008
I meet lots of customers
at the diving shop.

34:40.591 --> 34:41.591
Really?

34:45.258 --> 34:47.341
-Hey, it's Tsuneo…
-Hey.

34:53.383 --> 34:55.383
You must be Josee.

34:58.341 --> 35:00.841
Perfect strike.

35:00.925 --> 35:05.258
Hi, I'm Tsuneo's oldest
and dearest friend,

35:05.341 --> 35:06.508
Hayato Matsuura.

35:07.425 --> 35:08.800
What social media do you use?

35:08.883 --> 35:10.050
Easy, Hayato.

35:10.633 --> 35:12.258
I don't have one.

35:15.466 --> 35:19.133
She's a fairy. Living in analog!

35:19.216 --> 35:20.050
Knock it off.

35:20.633 --> 35:21.508
What'll we do?

35:22.175 --> 35:23.841
Sorry, I'll be right back.

35:26.050 --> 35:28.258
Welcome, ladies. Come in.

35:28.341 --> 35:30.133
You don't have to worry about him.

35:30.216 --> 35:31.633
Welcome. This way.

35:32.216 --> 35:34.550
Please take a seat.

35:39.841 --> 35:41.550
Tsuneo, you're here.

35:42.133 --> 35:43.300
Just passing by.

35:44.758 --> 35:47.091
How can I help you today?

35:47.175 --> 35:50.258
We want to get our diving licenses.

35:50.341 --> 35:51.216
I see.

35:51.966 --> 35:54.508
How do you do? I'm Mai Ninomiya.

35:54.591 --> 35:56.675
Tsuneo's told me a lot about you.

35:59.383 --> 36:02.966
If there's anything you need, please ask.

36:06.258 --> 36:09.341
Oh, yesterday I saw a clown frogfish!

36:09.925 --> 36:11.883
You took the photo yourself?

36:11.966 --> 36:14.758
No, the strong swell kept interfering.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.341
I want to leave.

36:18.341 --> 36:19.383
We just got here.

36:21.591 --> 36:22.508
Josee?

36:23.841 --> 36:24.675
Sorry.

36:28.175 --> 36:30.675
Did Josee leave already?

36:30.758 --> 36:32.675
What a rare beauty.

36:32.758 --> 36:36.175
Pale skin, modest, cute, and delicate…

36:36.258 --> 36:38.508
Get back to work.

36:39.258 --> 36:40.300
What's wrong?

36:40.383 --> 36:42.008
Nothing!

36:42.091 --> 36:45.425
You wanted to see where I work.

36:48.633 --> 36:51.091
I don't like places like this.

36:52.050 --> 36:53.091
Places like this?

36:56.216 --> 36:58.550
I don't know what there is to hate.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.591
You wouldn't!

37:00.175 --> 37:01.633
That's right. I don't!

37:16.633 --> 37:17.466
No, thanks.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.175
But alone, you…

37:25.800 --> 37:28.008
Tell him not to come anymore.

37:29.841 --> 37:30.841
What happened?

37:31.425 --> 37:32.800
Just tell him.

37:34.508 --> 37:36.258
All right, I will.

37:42.133 --> 37:44.008
I'm a mess, Yukichi.

37:49.758 --> 37:51.508
I don't have to come?

37:53.841 --> 37:54.966
I understand.

38:02.133 --> 38:04.258
No, I don't understand!

38:15.550 --> 38:17.383
Like that? I'm really proud of it.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.966
This here…

38:26.508 --> 38:27.341
Sorry.

38:28.508 --> 38:29.466
What is it?

38:31.966 --> 38:35.966
I've been granted
a scholarship to study abroad!

38:36.050 --> 38:39.758
That's great! When do you go?

38:39.841 --> 38:41.258
Next March.

38:41.841 --> 38:43.925
School starts in September,

38:44.425 --> 38:48.175
but they want me to come after I graduate.

38:48.258 --> 38:53.050
I guess we'll only have
six more months working together.

38:58.216 --> 38:59.966
You've been coming alone lately.

39:00.675 --> 39:01.758
Where's Tsuneo?

39:04.091 --> 39:06.300
Who cares about that dunderhead?

39:06.925 --> 39:08.258
Dunderhead?

39:08.841 --> 39:11.758
He's useless and takes up a lot of space.

39:12.383 --> 39:15.133
He eats like he's starving
and flirts with girls.

39:15.216 --> 39:16.383
JAPANESE NOVELS

39:16.466 --> 39:17.550
What's so funny?

39:18.341 --> 39:21.258
Sorry, but you're just so obvious.

39:21.841 --> 39:23.508
What's obvious?

39:23.591 --> 39:24.716
Kana!

39:25.300 --> 39:26.175
Hi, Rio!

39:28.091 --> 39:28.925
Read this.

39:30.466 --> 39:31.508
What's wrong?

39:31.591 --> 39:35.758
I always read to kids at this time of day.

39:36.383 --> 39:39.258
But a worker just quit on us.

39:39.341 --> 39:40.883
Anyone here?

39:40.966 --> 39:41.800
Coming!

39:42.466 --> 39:43.341
I'm sorry.

39:50.216 --> 39:51.300
Will you read to us?

39:56.341 --> 39:59.175
The Little Mermaid.

39:59.258 --> 40:02.050
This lady is going to read to us!

40:05.841 --> 40:07.466
I don't think I can…

40:07.550 --> 40:08.591
Hurry and read.

40:08.675 --> 40:10.050
-Hurry.
-We're waiting.

40:10.133 --> 40:11.591
-Keep reading.
-Please.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.300
-What's wrong?
-Come on.

40:17.758 --> 40:19.466
"On the bed of a limpid,

40:19.550 --> 40:22.091
blue sea stood a pearl palace,

40:22.175 --> 40:25.383
where six princess mermaids lived."

40:26.591 --> 40:30.841
"They loved to listen
to the king tell stories

40:30.925 --> 40:35.675
about the world they'd see
above the waves as adults."

40:35.758 --> 40:38.675
"The sky, birds,
exotic things, city lights."

40:39.258 --> 40:42.675
"The princesses waited
with eager anticipation

40:42.758 --> 40:44.425
for that day to come."

40:45.008 --> 40:46.591
"'Farewell, good prince,'

40:46.675 --> 40:49.633
the mermaid said, tossing her knife."

40:49.716 --> 40:52.550
"And she dove into the sea,

40:52.633 --> 40:56.425
where her body melted away into bubbles."

41:01.758 --> 41:04.008
I can't read stories very well.

41:05.300 --> 41:06.425
Question!

41:07.050 --> 41:09.633
What did her palace look like?

41:23.466 --> 41:25.675
Look, the mermaid palace!

41:27.216 --> 41:29.758
It really looks like a mermaid home.

41:31.383 --> 41:33.966
Josee, you're an illustrator?

41:34.050 --> 41:35.383
No way!

41:35.466 --> 41:38.258
What a shame it would be

41:38.341 --> 41:41.133
for people not to see your art.

41:41.716 --> 41:45.175
I think you should
put together a collection

41:45.258 --> 41:46.925
and get them published!

41:47.008 --> 41:47.841
I can't!

41:51.758 --> 41:52.591
Sorry.

41:59.175 --> 42:00.008
Good evening.

42:02.133 --> 42:05.008
Go home! No dunderheads allowed!

42:10.050 --> 42:11.175
What are you doing?

42:21.091 --> 42:22.841
It's pretty good, right?

42:24.383 --> 42:25.925
You made it, My Servant?

42:26.800 --> 42:28.425
Yes, Your Servant made it.

42:30.383 --> 42:32.425
No wonder it's so ugly.

42:35.841 --> 42:37.008
What's it called?

42:37.841 --> 42:38.883
It's a clarion angel.

42:40.383 --> 42:43.341
A rare species found only near Mexico.

42:45.175 --> 42:49.508
When I was a kid,
my local fish store had one,

42:50.133 --> 42:51.466
and I fell in love with it.

42:52.966 --> 42:56.883
I'd go to look at it
every day after school.

42:58.591 --> 43:01.300
When I learned it swam in schools,

43:01.383 --> 43:02.675
my interest grew more.

43:04.133 --> 43:07.341
It wants to be with family too.

43:08.675 --> 43:09.508
What do you mean?

43:10.008 --> 43:11.925
My parents are divorced.

43:13.258 --> 43:17.175
Dad left home, and Mom
was always busy working.

43:18.508 --> 43:22.716
I don't think he was sad,
though, the clarion angel.

43:24.091 --> 43:26.383
He had you come every day.

43:29.300 --> 43:32.883
I've long dreamed
of seeing him swimming in a school.

43:34.425 --> 43:37.633
It's why I've studied so hard
and saved money.

43:38.341 --> 43:40.133
They're hard to find

43:40.675 --> 43:43.216
so a brief diving vacation wouldn't do.

43:45.508 --> 43:46.633
It's a nice dream.

43:49.008 --> 43:50.425
I hope it comes true.

43:56.091 --> 43:57.841
Actually, next year…

43:59.383 --> 44:00.383
This is defective.

44:00.466 --> 44:01.758
That's odd.

44:05.425 --> 44:06.466
There, all fixed.

44:22.758 --> 44:24.841
That hurts!

44:24.925 --> 44:27.466
Why the heck did you do that?

44:47.591 --> 44:48.425
Hello!

44:55.758 --> 44:56.883
Ready to go?

45:03.550 --> 45:04.383
Kumiko!

45:07.591 --> 45:10.341
Grandma, the world isn't all scary.

45:49.300 --> 45:50.841
I'm going to have nightmares.

45:51.425 --> 45:54.258
Nightmares? You came to see this.

45:54.883 --> 45:58.841
I wanted to see
the scariest thing here with you.

46:01.675 --> 46:04.258
I thought I could do it
with you by my side.

46:05.008 --> 46:05.883
With me by your side?

46:14.050 --> 46:15.008
To hold onto.

46:17.758 --> 46:21.133
I needed something
to hold onto if I got scared.

46:26.550 --> 46:27.633
That hurts.

46:32.383 --> 46:36.175
I read a story aloud
to children the other day.

46:36.258 --> 46:38.133
You, Josee? What was it?

46:38.883 --> 46:40.008
The Little Mermaid.

46:40.091 --> 46:42.050
Wow, that's amazing.

46:44.133 --> 46:45.466
I didn't read it very well.

46:46.175 --> 46:48.758
I got so nervous, I couldn't look up.

46:50.675 --> 46:51.633
It was scary.

46:54.341 --> 46:56.550
But then I drew a picture,

46:56.633 --> 46:58.216
and the children all loved it.

47:01.133 --> 47:03.050
I want to draw more.

47:03.716 --> 47:04.550
More?

47:05.050 --> 47:08.341
As a job. I want to draw professionally.

47:10.466 --> 47:11.883
I want to give it a shot.

47:12.883 --> 47:14.008
Like what you're doing.

47:17.716 --> 47:19.216
Well, I love…

47:20.341 --> 47:21.175
your drawings.

47:23.383 --> 47:25.300
Pretty cocky for a servant.

47:28.216 --> 47:31.550
Cherry blossoms fall
like rain here in spring.

47:32.175 --> 47:34.175
My dad used to bring me.

47:35.508 --> 47:36.883
It must be beautiful.

47:38.133 --> 47:42.133
If you want to see it,
you can bring me next year.

47:44.633 --> 47:45.466
What's wrong?

47:47.925 --> 47:48.758
Nothing.

48:21.966 --> 48:24.800
Did you hear about Ms. Yamamura?

48:24.883 --> 48:28.216
She's had a bad heart for some time.

48:29.091 --> 48:31.216
And she was quite old.

48:31.300 --> 48:34.300
CHIZU YAMAMURA

48:42.883 --> 48:44.425
The morticians left.

48:46.966 --> 48:49.008
If you need to talk, I'm here.

48:50.258 --> 48:51.716
About what to do next.

48:55.175 --> 48:59.175
Grandma left me a little money to live on.

49:00.175 --> 49:01.758
I'll be okay for a while.

49:03.216 --> 49:04.050
I see.

49:05.883 --> 49:08.133
But I can't afford to pay.

49:10.133 --> 49:13.466
I can't pay My Servant wages.

49:18.466 --> 49:19.300
I understand.

50:07.425 --> 50:09.800
OUT OF OXYGEN

50:36.341 --> 50:39.258
It's rare for you
to lose track of oxygen, Tsuneo.

50:40.341 --> 50:42.383
You seem distracted.

50:42.466 --> 50:44.800
I know. You confessed--

50:47.175 --> 50:49.216
Josee's grandmother died.

50:51.008 --> 50:53.966
So now she's all alone.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.508
That's pretty harsh.

50:57.216 --> 50:59.008
And worrying.

51:01.425 --> 51:03.633
She's not a child,

51:04.133 --> 51:06.675
and there are welfare services
and facilities.

51:11.883 --> 51:13.591
"Free yourself from life."

51:14.550 --> 51:17.258
"From that which others call life."

51:17.800 --> 51:18.841
"Be free from emotion,

51:19.550 --> 51:23.091
from one's strengths,
one's own weaknesses."

51:23.675 --> 51:25.841
"Be but one momentary breath,

51:25.925 --> 51:29.758
one-millionth of a billion nebulas."

51:36.050 --> 51:39.091
Are you home, Ms. Kumiko? It's Mizushima.

51:43.383 --> 51:46.091
This is Mr. Fujita, a social worker.

51:46.841 --> 51:52.800
The resident's association chairman
got a call from one of your neighbors.

51:53.383 --> 51:56.050
They heard your grandmother passed

51:56.133 --> 51:58.133
and felt you needed assistance.

51:59.508 --> 52:00.716
It's none of their business.

52:03.050 --> 52:06.341
How do you plan to move forward?

52:08.050 --> 52:08.883
Pictures.

52:10.966 --> 52:13.133
I plan to draw pictures.

52:15.966 --> 52:20.758
You're saying you'll earn
a living as an artist?

52:21.716 --> 52:25.008
I think it's wonderful to have a dream.

52:25.591 --> 52:29.341
Dreams are one thing. Reality is another.

52:29.425 --> 52:31.966
You of all should know that.

52:32.550 --> 52:35.675
Don't be foolish. Go look for work…

52:37.050 --> 52:40.091
Your grandma's not here to dote on you.

52:41.216 --> 52:42.758
Mr. Fujita.

52:42.841 --> 52:48.175
Or is there someone else
who will support you?

53:09.550 --> 53:10.800
Are you okay?

53:13.675 --> 53:15.841
I'm Mai. We met the other day.

53:17.800 --> 53:18.633
Why are you here?

53:19.675 --> 53:24.300
I remembered Tsuneo saying
you lived by the river.

53:25.800 --> 53:30.216
It would've been faster
if we had just asked Tsuneo.

53:34.133 --> 53:35.091
What do you want?

53:41.175 --> 53:42.966
I beg you to free Tsuneo.

53:43.925 --> 53:46.258
Wait, we came to cheer her up!

53:46.341 --> 53:49.466
He's worked so hard for his dream.

53:50.050 --> 53:53.966
Studying Spanish, working to save money

53:54.466 --> 53:56.091
so he can study abroad.

53:56.675 --> 53:57.508
Study abroad?

53:58.133 --> 54:01.675
Next March, he's going to Mexico.

54:03.633 --> 54:04.633
He didn't tell you?

54:06.716 --> 54:09.008
Would you support his dream?

54:09.633 --> 54:10.675
At this rate--

54:10.758 --> 54:13.175
Why do you have to ask my permission?

54:15.341 --> 54:17.258
What's your relationship with him?

54:29.425 --> 54:30.341
It's sympathy.

54:32.050 --> 54:35.550
Tsuneo only visits you
out of pity for your condition.

54:36.591 --> 54:37.800
What the hell are you saying?

54:38.925 --> 54:39.841
Don't listen to her.

54:41.550 --> 54:43.216
Hey, wait up!

54:45.550 --> 54:47.550
What types of cytoplasm do I mean?

54:47.633 --> 54:50.091
That's right, cytoplasmic genomes.

54:50.883 --> 54:54.758
You can consider them
a place to store genomes.

55:01.258 --> 55:03.591
THE LITTLE MERMAID

55:10.133 --> 55:11.008
Hello.

55:18.633 --> 55:21.800
Josee, I brought fish-shaped cakes.

55:24.550 --> 55:25.591
Why did you come?

55:28.966 --> 55:29.800
Josee?

55:31.716 --> 55:32.550
Your room…

55:33.091 --> 55:38.841
I asked a helper to come
and clean the place once a month.

55:39.591 --> 55:40.675
And your pictures?

55:40.758 --> 55:41.591
Thrown out.

55:41.675 --> 55:42.883
What? Why?

55:43.591 --> 55:45.466
None of your business.

55:46.425 --> 55:48.466
If that's all, you can go.

56:03.716 --> 56:04.841
I'll fix it right away.

56:14.383 --> 56:15.508
I want to go to the sea.

56:18.383 --> 56:21.008
This will be your last job as My Servant.

57:00.091 --> 57:01.383
Up to the waterline?

57:01.883 --> 57:02.800
This is fine.

57:04.925 --> 57:06.175
How about a warm drink?

57:06.675 --> 57:07.508
No thanks.

57:19.633 --> 57:20.466
It's salty.

57:25.425 --> 57:26.258
Josee.

57:32.466 --> 57:35.883
I don't want money.
Don't call this the last job.

57:36.675 --> 57:37.508
Josee!

57:39.508 --> 57:40.466
I'm no longer Josee.

57:42.550 --> 57:45.383
I've taken a job in an office.

57:46.300 --> 57:49.008
You didn't need to get rid of your art.

57:49.591 --> 57:50.800
It was out of reach.

57:52.383 --> 57:53.758
Everything's always out of reach.

57:55.133 --> 57:57.216
The red balloon caught on the roof.

57:58.091 --> 57:59.966
The cicada husk on the tree.

58:01.341 --> 58:03.800
Walking under an umbrella in the rain.

58:04.300 --> 58:07.008
Climbing the steps of a shrine.

58:08.341 --> 58:09.175
All of it.

58:11.633 --> 58:14.508
I no longer wish to reach for any of it.

58:16.383 --> 58:20.508
If you really don't,
then why do you look so sad?

58:22.675 --> 58:24.216
Don't give up what you love!

58:27.675 --> 58:29.175
You're leaving soon, right?

58:36.300 --> 58:37.758
The healthy wouldn't understand.

59:13.050 --> 59:14.175
Josee!

59:18.675 --> 59:20.050
Josee!

59:39.675 --> 59:40.508
My Servant…

59:42.133 --> 59:43.091
My Servant.

59:45.758 --> 59:46.883
My Servant!

59:47.925 --> 59:49.133
My Servant!

59:51.883 --> 59:55.425
Tsuneo!

1:00:02.175 --> 1:00:03.466
Are you all right?

1:00:04.675 --> 1:00:08.966
There's been a traffic accident!

1:00:18.716 --> 1:00:20.175
-Remove the scoop.
-Yes.

1:00:20.258 --> 1:00:21.216
Cutting away clothes.

1:00:21.300 --> 1:00:25.300
Pulse 120, BP 70 over 40, saturation 94%.

1:00:25.383 --> 1:00:27.383
Maintain ten liters of oxygen.

1:00:27.466 --> 1:00:28.800
-Peripheral off?
-Not yet.

1:00:28.883 --> 1:00:30.925
Quickly, 18-gauge, full throttle.

1:00:31.008 --> 1:00:34.925
-Crossmatch. Don't forget the blood gas.
-Got it.

1:00:35.008 --> 1:00:36.550
X-ray standby!

1:00:37.175 --> 1:00:39.133
Airways clear, respiration's steady.

1:00:39.216 --> 1:00:40.883
Starting echo.

1:00:40.966 --> 1:00:42.508
Negative. Pneumothorax is fine.

1:00:43.758 --> 1:00:44.591
Mr. Suzukawa?

1:00:44.675 --> 1:00:48.425
Mr. Tsuneo Suzukawa? Can you hear me?

1:00:48.508 --> 1:00:51.758
If you can hear me, open your eyes.

1:01:14.675 --> 1:01:15.591
Are you awake?

1:01:16.675 --> 1:01:17.841
Yes.

1:01:17.925 --> 1:01:20.716
You were in a traffic accident.
This is a hospital.

1:01:22.216 --> 1:01:23.425
I'll call the doctor.

1:01:26.341 --> 1:01:28.883
The girl in the wheelchair?

1:01:28.966 --> 1:01:32.508
Oh, yes, we asked her to go home today.

1:01:32.591 --> 1:01:35.675
She insisted on waiting till you awoke.

1:01:36.383 --> 1:01:38.341
So she's not injured?

1:01:38.425 --> 1:01:39.258
No.

1:01:42.300 --> 1:01:43.675
How do you feel?

1:01:44.466 --> 1:01:46.300
I was in an accident?

1:01:47.091 --> 1:01:49.133
You suffered a concussion,

1:01:49.216 --> 1:01:51.675
but tests showed nothing was wrong.

1:01:52.300 --> 1:01:55.133
Your internal organs are sound,

1:01:56.133 --> 1:01:59.633
but your right shinbone
is broken at the ankle.

1:02:00.883 --> 1:02:02.383
In short, an open fracture.

1:02:03.175 --> 1:02:05.300
Emergency surgery was done

1:02:05.383 --> 1:02:07.841
to prevent infection at the wound.

1:02:08.383 --> 1:02:12.008
We secured the fracture
with screws and a plate.

1:02:12.633 --> 1:02:17.508
It'll take two months
before it can bear your weight.

1:02:18.175 --> 1:02:19.300
Two months.

1:02:20.091 --> 1:02:21.383
One more thing.

1:02:21.466 --> 1:02:27.133
Surgery couldn't unite
the joint surfaces perfectly.

1:02:27.216 --> 1:02:29.633
There's a risk of osteoarthritis.

1:02:30.550 --> 1:02:32.508
Osteoarthritis?

1:02:33.591 --> 1:02:38.133
You could experience
joint pain and stiffness,

1:02:38.216 --> 1:02:41.216
making it hard to walk or run like before.

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:45.133
The hairline fracture in your left arm

1:02:45.216 --> 1:02:49.466
may make crutches moot for a while.

1:02:51.966 --> 1:02:53.008
Will I heal?

1:02:55.550 --> 1:02:57.925
It's hard to say at this stage.

1:03:12.883 --> 1:03:13.716
Josee.

1:03:14.883 --> 1:03:15.925
I'm sorry.

1:03:19.591 --> 1:03:20.675
It's not your fault.

1:03:23.425 --> 1:03:25.925
I seem to be in pretty bad shape.

1:03:26.966 --> 1:03:29.675
Even rehab might not fix everything.

1:03:32.633 --> 1:03:36.133
If it turns out I can't walk again, I…

1:03:44.216 --> 1:03:45.175
I need to sleep.

1:04:02.216 --> 1:04:03.050
Quiet!

1:04:17.841 --> 1:04:19.925
You don't need to come, Mom.

1:04:20.425 --> 1:04:22.008
You'll hurt your back.

1:04:22.675 --> 1:04:24.550
It's no big deal, I swear.

1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:30.300
I'll come visit
after I leave the hospital. See you.

1:04:33.550 --> 1:04:34.383
Professor.

1:04:36.675 --> 1:04:38.466
How are you, Tsuneo?

1:04:39.050 --> 1:04:41.508
I'm sorry to worry you.

1:04:44.550 --> 1:04:46.966
Listen, about your study abroad.

1:04:48.383 --> 1:04:50.841
They'd like another student

1:04:50.925 --> 1:04:53.425
to come in March if you can't.

1:04:55.216 --> 1:04:58.966
It's a pity,
but you'll get another chance.

1:04:59.675 --> 1:05:02.966
For now, just focus on getting well.

1:05:07.716 --> 1:05:08.716
That's not the problem.

1:05:10.550 --> 1:05:13.966
It's possible I may not
be able to dive anymore.

1:05:16.383 --> 1:05:21.175
If I can't do that,
I'll lose my reason for going abroad.

1:05:31.508 --> 1:05:35.050
SPANISH GRAMMAR

1:06:02.841 --> 1:06:04.800
So rotate your ankle

1:06:04.883 --> 1:06:09.133
and extend your toes
to the extent possible.

1:06:09.758 --> 1:06:12.591
When the swelling goes down,

1:06:12.675 --> 1:06:16.341
we can shift to your rehabilitation.

1:06:19.008 --> 1:06:19.841
Tsuneo.

1:06:21.758 --> 1:06:22.883
I bought pudding.

1:06:24.883 --> 1:06:25.758
Thanks.

1:06:28.050 --> 1:06:29.758
Starting rehab already?

1:06:30.966 --> 1:06:31.800
Yeah.

1:06:32.591 --> 1:06:34.383
I'll put this in the fridge.

1:06:36.175 --> 1:06:41.050
My parents keep sending
rice and vegetables.

1:06:41.133 --> 1:06:43.466
My fridge is bulging.

1:06:43.550 --> 1:06:45.300
SPANISH GRAMMAR

1:06:51.633 --> 1:06:53.925
Want to get some fresh air?

1:07:06.550 --> 1:07:08.675
Feel free to say what's on your mind.

1:07:10.008 --> 1:07:11.675
I'm here to give you my support.

1:07:14.466 --> 1:07:18.925
It doesn't matter anymore…
Studying abroad, Mexico.

1:07:21.091 --> 1:07:24.591
I thought I was stronger than this.

1:07:25.966 --> 1:07:27.591
Please don't give up.

1:07:27.675 --> 1:07:29.091
Work hard on rehab--

1:07:29.175 --> 1:07:31.883
"Work hard"? What if it doesn't matter?

1:07:34.383 --> 1:07:37.008
I didn't understand anything.

1:07:38.425 --> 1:07:42.133
How scary it is
to reach for something I want.

1:07:48.841 --> 1:07:51.133
I…

1:07:51.216 --> 1:07:52.133
have feelings for you, Tsuneo!

1:07:53.425 --> 1:07:55.800
I just didn't want that

1:07:55.883 --> 1:07:58.925
to get in the way of your goals.

1:08:01.175 --> 1:08:02.383
But I can't help it.

1:08:04.383 --> 1:08:06.425
I'm madly in love with you!

1:08:13.425 --> 1:08:14.800
How'd this happen?

1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:18.675
Mai, listen. I--

1:08:18.758 --> 1:08:19.883
I know.

1:08:21.300 --> 1:08:24.008
I don't need a "Sorry" or a "Thanks."

1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:27.966
I hate women who cry in front of men.

1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:32.716
But…

1:08:35.216 --> 1:08:36.508
I needed to say it.

1:08:45.716 --> 1:08:47.300
We should get back.

1:09:07.966 --> 1:09:10.341
I know you're there! Answer the door!

1:09:15.425 --> 1:09:16.425
If you don't…

1:09:18.508 --> 1:09:19.341
Go away!

1:09:21.466 --> 1:09:22.425
Don't come back.

1:09:25.425 --> 1:09:27.883
Tsuneo's given up on studying abroad.

1:09:29.883 --> 1:09:31.716
So now I'm making him mine.

1:09:32.633 --> 1:09:36.841
I'll give him the love
he needs to forget the sea.

1:09:39.008 --> 1:09:41.716
I never wanted him to go to Mexico.

1:09:43.341 --> 1:09:45.591
I prayed he'd forget his silly dream

1:09:46.716 --> 1:09:50.800
and stay near me.
I wanted to be by his side.

1:09:53.258 --> 1:09:55.216
I know him so much better than you.

1:09:56.258 --> 1:10:00.633
His love for talking about fish,
the awful way he hums.

1:10:01.550 --> 1:10:03.383
He's bad at rock-paper-scissors.

1:10:04.758 --> 1:10:08.008
He likes pudding, hates cucumbers,

1:10:08.091 --> 1:10:10.841
and always has ice-cold hands.

1:10:13.175 --> 1:10:15.966
I could name a hundred more things.

1:10:16.050 --> 1:10:18.758
I know him far better.

1:10:21.258 --> 1:10:22.966
Well, say something!

1:10:24.841 --> 1:10:26.883
My Servant's never giving up.

1:10:27.466 --> 1:10:31.758
He'll never forget
about fish or abandon his dream!

1:10:32.341 --> 1:10:33.508
That's who he is!

1:10:34.466 --> 1:10:36.091
You know that, right?

1:10:38.341 --> 1:10:41.716
I can't name a hundred things about him.

1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:46.341
But you can't beat my feelings for him.

1:10:48.633 --> 1:10:50.925
If that's true, then show it!

1:11:06.300 --> 1:11:07.383
Salty.

1:11:16.883 --> 1:11:18.300
You're clumsy.

1:11:19.883 --> 1:11:21.466
I'm a good woman.

1:11:26.675 --> 1:11:30.341
Why don't you buy me dinner then?

1:11:30.425 --> 1:11:31.258
What?

1:12:07.216 --> 1:12:08.050
Josee.

1:12:11.008 --> 1:12:12.133
I have a request.

1:12:23.925 --> 1:12:27.966
You should let the characters
show more emotions.

1:12:28.633 --> 1:12:30.091
Say how they feel.

1:12:31.008 --> 1:12:31.841
I see.

1:13:09.216 --> 1:13:10.258
Hey, redhead.

1:13:11.383 --> 1:13:12.300
Josee?

1:13:14.008 --> 1:13:14.925
Lend me your face.

1:13:16.133 --> 1:13:17.175
What?

1:13:17.258 --> 1:13:20.466
LOST PROFILE

1:13:21.591 --> 1:13:25.966
I desired nothing but my escape from him.

1:13:26.758 --> 1:13:27.883
That is all.

1:13:29.383 --> 1:13:33.175
Upon reflection,
it was truly a pitiful story.

1:13:41.883 --> 1:13:42.758
It's done.

1:13:43.341 --> 1:13:44.175
Ta-da.

1:13:47.925 --> 1:13:49.133
What's this?

1:13:49.216 --> 1:13:51.800
Isn't it obvious? Permission to leave.

1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:54.841
No, why do you have it?

1:13:54.925 --> 1:13:57.258
I just figured you might seek

1:13:57.341 --> 1:13:59.966
a change of pace once in a while.

1:14:02.341 --> 1:14:05.216
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood.

1:14:05.300 --> 1:14:09.550
Don't be such a bore, Tsuneo.
Let's have some fun!

1:14:09.633 --> 1:14:10.800
Leave me alone!

1:14:16.925 --> 1:14:20.841
As your diving buddy,
it's my job to give you oxygen…

1:14:22.925 --> 1:14:26.758
whenever you need it.
So shut up and follow me.

1:14:33.966 --> 1:14:35.216
What's going on?

1:14:35.300 --> 1:14:36.383
Don't ask questions.

1:14:41.341 --> 1:14:42.175
This place.

1:15:00.716 --> 1:15:05.091
THE MERMAID AND THE SHINY WING

1:15:06.050 --> 1:15:10.216
The Mermaid and the Shiny Wing.

1:15:19.925 --> 1:15:22.258
From the floor of the deep blue sea,

1:15:22.341 --> 1:15:24.550
festive music is heard.

1:15:25.216 --> 1:15:27.800
It's a mermaid's 20th birthday

1:15:27.883 --> 1:15:31.133
when she can leave the sea.

1:15:36.008 --> 1:15:36.883
You're doing fine.

1:15:44.091 --> 1:15:48.883
The mermaid received
a magic shell as a gift.

1:15:50.008 --> 1:15:51.383
And it spoke to her.

1:15:51.966 --> 1:15:54.966
"You can use me to turn human,

1:15:55.050 --> 1:15:56.883
and back into a mermaid again."

1:15:58.050 --> 1:16:01.716
"But you must not wish for anything else."

1:16:02.383 --> 1:16:04.216
"For if you do,

1:16:05.716 --> 1:16:08.300
you'll turn to froth and vanish forever."

1:16:09.883 --> 1:16:13.716
"I understand,"
said the mermaid and swam ashore.

1:16:15.091 --> 1:16:18.258
"Oh, shell, turn me into a human."

1:16:20.216 --> 1:16:23.466
Suddenly, her fins became graceful legs.

1:16:24.466 --> 1:16:28.466
"How wonderful,"
she exclaimed as she climbed a hill.

1:16:29.550 --> 1:16:32.633
But the world outside was full of danger.

1:16:34.216 --> 1:16:37.466
A ferocious tiger appeared before her.

1:16:39.091 --> 1:16:41.133
The mermaid tried to run

1:16:42.050 --> 1:16:44.300
but lost her footing and fell.

1:16:45.383 --> 1:16:49.633
Clinging to a rock, she yelled, "Help!"

1:16:51.341 --> 1:16:55.175
Just then, a young man
with pure white wings

1:16:55.258 --> 1:16:57.966
descended from the sky to help.

1:16:58.966 --> 1:17:01.175
"Thank you. Those are lovely wings."

1:17:02.091 --> 1:17:05.300
The young man
beamed happily at those words.

1:17:06.508 --> 1:17:09.841
"When spring comes,
I'm taking flight with them."

1:17:10.883 --> 1:17:12.966
For he had a dream.

1:17:14.925 --> 1:17:19.466
It was to fly
to a shiny sea far, far away.

1:17:20.383 --> 1:17:24.091
A place where a family
of bright orange fish swam.

1:17:24.841 --> 1:17:26.966
A vast sea, full of fun and frolic.

1:17:28.466 --> 1:17:32.508
The two became friends
and went to many places together.

1:17:33.883 --> 1:17:37.425
"Every place makes my heart
dance with such joy,

1:17:37.508 --> 1:17:39.091
I feel like skipping."

1:17:40.091 --> 1:17:43.383
The mermaid saw her world grow and expand.

1:17:44.841 --> 1:17:47.425
The seasons changed and spring arrived.

1:17:48.300 --> 1:17:52.133
The day for
the young man's departure came.

1:17:52.841 --> 1:17:57.633
The mermaid was sad
and walked alone in the woods.

1:17:58.508 --> 1:18:02.758
Again, a ferocious tiger
appeared before her.

1:18:03.716 --> 1:18:07.341
Claws sharp, fangs bared,
it pounced on the mermaid.

1:18:07.925 --> 1:18:10.258
"Look out," cried the young man,

1:18:10.341 --> 1:18:13.050
appearing just in time to save her.

1:18:13.925 --> 1:18:16.758
But this time, he was injured,

1:18:17.383 --> 1:18:19.925
his gorgeous wings, broken.

1:18:21.466 --> 1:18:23.508
Sobbing with grief,

1:18:24.008 --> 1:18:27.508
the mermaid took
the magic shell in her hands

1:18:28.841 --> 1:18:31.591
and wished, "Please save him."

1:18:33.383 --> 1:18:36.300
Within seconds, his wounds healed

1:18:36.841 --> 1:18:38.591
and the youth awoke alive and well,

1:18:39.466 --> 1:18:42.716
but his wings would never return.

1:18:43.883 --> 1:18:49.508
"I can no longer reach
the shiny sea," he lamented.

1:18:50.216 --> 1:18:51.883
The mermaid said, "Raise your head."

1:18:52.925 --> 1:18:56.383
"You have larger wings in your heart."

1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:00.300
"With those wings, you sheltered me

1:19:01.133 --> 1:19:03.758
and used them to push me forward."

1:19:04.633 --> 1:19:08.758
"With wings of the heart,
you can fly anywhere."

1:19:10.300 --> 1:19:13.925
The young man set off
for the shiny sea by boat.

1:19:15.091 --> 1:19:17.675
In driving rain or stormy winds,

1:19:17.758 --> 1:19:19.841
he pushed ever forward.

1:19:20.633 --> 1:19:24.591
"I'm not afraid
for I'm in pursuit of my dreams."

1:19:25.591 --> 1:19:31.341
His heart wings were
strong, supple, and beautiful.

1:19:31.425 --> 1:19:33.216
And most of all, unbreakable.

1:19:34.383 --> 1:19:36.800
At last, he found the shiny sea.

1:19:38.091 --> 1:19:40.758
With great joy, he dove into it.

1:19:40.841 --> 1:19:45.133
He started swimming freely
with the orange fish,

1:19:46.383 --> 1:19:49.508
so happy that his dream came true.

1:19:50.966 --> 1:19:54.966
"Oh, shell, you can now
turn me into bubbles."

1:19:56.758 --> 1:20:00.466
But her legs turned back into fins

1:20:00.550 --> 1:20:03.091
and nothing else occurred.

1:20:04.466 --> 1:20:06.050
The magic shell spoke.

1:20:07.091 --> 1:20:08.383
"Wishing for another's benefit

1:20:08.925 --> 1:20:13.133
and not your own
will never make you vanish."

1:20:16.258 --> 1:20:20.841
So with a heart filled
with shiny jewels of memories,

1:20:20.925 --> 1:20:24.216
the mermaid returned to the deep blue sea.

1:20:25.758 --> 1:20:26.591
The end.

1:22:14.466 --> 1:22:15.758
Why are you hiding?

1:22:23.633 --> 1:22:25.091
Look, I think he can make it!

1:22:41.466 --> 1:22:43.508
-You did it!
-You did it!

1:22:55.258 --> 1:22:57.883
Yukichi, My Servant walked today.

1:23:01.508 --> 1:23:03.550
Stray cats must not get spoiled.

1:23:11.633 --> 1:23:12.883
Must not get spoiled.

1:23:15.550 --> 1:23:17.383
Fight the tiger yourself.

1:23:21.425 --> 1:23:22.508
I'm getting out!

1:23:24.216 --> 1:23:27.258
I just need to make weekly visits.

1:23:28.050 --> 1:23:31.758
That's great. Congrats!

1:23:33.175 --> 1:23:34.008
Thanks.

1:23:36.716 --> 1:23:39.050
I'm not sure about the side effects yet,

1:23:40.258 --> 1:23:43.091
but I'm going to Mexico no matter what.

1:23:45.091 --> 1:23:47.175
Now that I've got heart wings.

1:23:51.716 --> 1:23:53.175
You'll be fine.

1:23:56.841 --> 1:23:59.841
They're letting me leave on the 24th.

1:24:01.008 --> 1:24:03.383
Can you come get me?

1:24:03.966 --> 1:24:04.925
10 a.m.

1:24:09.800 --> 1:24:10.633
Josee?

1:24:13.591 --> 1:24:15.675
I'm just so happy.

1:24:17.633 --> 1:24:18.466
Thank you.

1:25:43.633 --> 1:25:44.466
Josee?

1:25:59.466 --> 1:26:00.425
Josee!

1:26:23.758 --> 1:26:24.591
Josee.

1:26:26.300 --> 1:26:27.133
Here.

1:26:32.300 --> 1:26:33.133
Ms. Kana!

1:26:33.633 --> 1:26:36.300
Tsuneo, congrats on getting out.

1:26:37.133 --> 1:26:38.091
Where's Josee?

1:26:38.175 --> 1:26:39.800
I haven't seen her today.

1:26:42.050 --> 1:26:42.883
Sorry.

1:26:44.133 --> 1:26:45.591
You're so right.

1:26:47.633 --> 1:26:49.550
Big trouble! Josee's missing!

1:27:17.341 --> 1:27:20.258
A girl in a wheelchair just boarded.

1:27:21.841 --> 1:27:23.800
Do you know where to?

1:28:20.758 --> 1:28:22.716
Attention, guests.

1:28:24.091 --> 1:28:26.800
The zoo will be closing in a few minutes.

1:28:27.716 --> 1:28:33.633
Please make sure you have
all your belongings with you.

1:29:32.675 --> 1:29:33.550
Josee.

1:29:50.216 --> 1:29:51.050
Stop!

1:29:53.341 --> 1:29:54.175
Sorry!

1:30:12.008 --> 1:30:13.091
Josee!

1:30:27.008 --> 1:30:28.091
That hurts.

1:30:30.883 --> 1:30:33.175
You all right, Josee?

1:30:34.383 --> 1:30:35.966
Are you okay yourself?

1:30:40.091 --> 1:30:40.925
Your leg.

1:30:41.841 --> 1:30:43.466
You just got out.

1:30:45.133 --> 1:30:49.008
In my panic to find you,
I found myself running.

1:30:50.341 --> 1:30:51.175
Why?

1:30:56.550 --> 1:30:58.925
I've decided to try to become

1:30:59.008 --> 1:31:00.925
a picture book illustrator.

1:31:02.133 --> 1:31:03.966
I plan to stand on my own two feet.

1:31:06.258 --> 1:31:10.716
You've pushed me
from behind for long enough.

1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:11.841
It's not for you.

1:31:14.383 --> 1:31:15.716
It wasn't for you.

1:31:17.466 --> 1:31:19.300
I want to be Your Servant.

1:31:22.383 --> 1:31:24.591
What about the clarion angel?

1:31:25.175 --> 1:31:27.133
And going to Mexico?

1:31:27.675 --> 1:31:29.675
I'll still go, but…

1:31:31.175 --> 1:31:32.216
I love you, Josee!

1:31:41.341 --> 1:31:42.175
I…

1:31:44.258 --> 1:31:45.091
I…

1:31:48.716 --> 1:31:50.258
love you too, My Servant.

1:32:18.341 --> 1:32:20.383
It's not at all like I imagined.

1:32:22.008 --> 1:32:24.383
What? In a bad way?

1:32:26.925 --> 1:32:28.216
In a good way.

1:37:18.841 --> 1:37:20.425
-Pretty, right?
-Yes.

1:37:25.216 --> 1:37:26.925
It's really a cherry blossom rain.

1:37:33.383 --> 1:37:34.758
Did you die?

1:37:35.425 --> 1:37:36.300
What?

1:37:36.383 --> 1:37:37.675
Are you a ghost?

1:37:38.383 --> 1:37:40.175
I'm home for spring break.

1:37:40.258 --> 1:37:41.341
You didn't tell me!

1:37:42.258 --> 1:37:44.425
I wanted to surprise you.

1:37:48.008 --> 1:37:49.716
Pretty cocky for a servant.
