00:23.609 --> 00:24.886
- Hey.

00:34.896 --> 00:36.208
- Why didn't you stop him?

00:37.623 --> 00:39.694
- Stop him from what?

00:39.763 --> 00:42.663
- From walking into a diner
full of armed robbers.

00:44.630 --> 00:47.840
- Beth, I can't stop your
father from doing anything.

00:47.909 --> 00:50.222
He does what he does because
he thinks he's right.

00:51.948 --> 00:54.744
I can either help him
or I can watch him.

00:59.438 --> 01:03.028
I notice you aren't too worried
about me running in there.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.168
- Baby, I never worry about you.

01:08.206 --> 01:10.035
I know nothing's
happening to you.

01:10.794 --> 01:12.382
- Hm.

01:12.451 --> 01:13.970
It's gonna happen to me
one day.

01:16.973 --> 01:18.561
It happens to us all.

01:24.670 --> 01:26.051
I'll see you later.

01:45.484 --> 01:46.830
- Just you today?

01:46.899 --> 01:48.384
- Yeah, just me.

01:57.427 --> 01:58.497
You know how to ride?

02:00.637 --> 02:02.432
- No.

02:02.501 --> 02:05.297
But if there's an Olympic event
for shoveling shit,

02:05.366 --> 02:07.230
I'd win a medal.

02:07.299 --> 02:10.406
Sir. Sorry...

02:10.475 --> 02:12.235
- Bunch of goddam
pirates working for me.

02:14.479 --> 02:16.688
Saddle another one.

02:16.757 --> 02:17.965
Today you learn to ride.

02:21.658 --> 02:22.763
Hurry up.

02:27.216 --> 02:29.149
- Ouch, my balls! Fuck!

02:29.218 --> 02:30.840
- Well,you gotta bounce
with the horse.

02:30.909 --> 02:32.048
- I am bouncing with the horse.

02:32.117 --> 02:34.740
- No, no, no.

02:34.809 --> 02:37.985
All right? You're bouncing
against the horse.

02:38.054 --> 02:40.746
All right, when
the horse bounces up,

02:40.815 --> 02:42.023
let it stand you
in the stirrups,

02:42.092 --> 02:45.544
then when it comes down,
sit back in the saddle.

02:45.613 --> 02:46.925
Let's try.

02:55.140 --> 02:56.762
Better?

02:56.831 --> 02:58.971
- Better on my balls.
Harder on my legs.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.249
- That's life, Carter.

03:00.318 --> 03:02.354
Something's always getting beat
no matter what.

03:02.423 --> 03:04.287
- You guys do this all day?

03:04.356 --> 03:05.461
- It gets easier.

03:06.772 --> 03:08.464
- Well, it can't get
much fucking harder.

03:09.499 --> 03:11.191
- You know...
-

03:12.537 --> 03:13.710
You know what we're gonna do?

03:15.402 --> 03:17.162
We're gonna ride the foul
right out of your mouth.

03:18.957 --> 03:21.062
- Fuck!

03:21.131 --> 03:23.306
God damn it, slow down!

03:23.375 --> 03:24.997
- Just shut up and ride.

04:34.550 --> 04:36.483
They call this
the Buffalo valley.

04:38.381 --> 04:40.418
- Are there buffalo in it?

04:40.487 --> 04:44.422
- Yeah, well, sometimes they'll
wander up from the park...

04:44.491 --> 04:48.080
In 1889, when they thought
all the buffalo were gone,

04:48.149 --> 04:52.706
the Army came to our ranch
asking if anyone had seen any.

04:52.775 --> 04:55.260
My great grandfather
told 'em "no",

04:55.329 --> 04:58.539
'cause he thought they wanted
to kill the rest,

04:58.608 --> 05:02.129
but he knew where they were.

05:02.198 --> 05:03.337
They were right here.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.480
When the park started
to protect the buffalo,

05:08.549 --> 05:10.551
he and my grandfather herded
them down through Gardiner

05:10.620 --> 05:13.589
back into the park.

05:13.658 --> 05:16.937
And now, every buffalo
in the nation is descendants

05:17.006 --> 05:20.596
of the buffalo my ancestors
found right here.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.015
- Why'd they kill them
in the first place?

05:27.499 --> 05:30.157
- Well, the rich people
in New York

05:30.226 --> 05:31.745
liked to eat their tongues

05:31.814 --> 05:36.543
and the women in France liked
to wear their fur as coats.

05:36.612 --> 05:39.235
And the Army...

05:39.304 --> 05:41.686
Well, the Army
just wanted them gone.

05:44.620 --> 05:45.828
- Why'd the army want 'em gone?

05:47.174 --> 05:50.246
- Because they wanted
the Indians gone,

05:50.315 --> 05:52.213
and buffalo is what
Indians depended on.

05:54.768 --> 05:59.359
Now the buffalo live
on ranches or preserves.

06:01.188 --> 06:03.017
Not much different
for the Indians.

06:07.194 --> 06:08.678
- That's not fair.

06:08.747 --> 06:09.783
- No.

06:10.922 --> 06:12.855
- Let me...

06:15.582 --> 06:19.379
fair means one side got
exactly what they wanted

06:19.448 --> 06:21.588
in a way that the other side
can't complain about.

06:24.522 --> 06:26.386
There's no such thing as fair.

06:27.525 --> 06:28.664
Come on.

06:55.794 --> 06:57.451
You mind pouring me
one of those, honey?

06:59.971 --> 07:01.351
- Sure, Daddy.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.266
- What the fuck are you doing?

07:19.335 --> 07:21.095
- What the fuck
are you doing?

07:23.788 --> 07:25.445
You don't know
how lucky you are.

07:26.756 --> 07:29.414
Your coma, that was
a gift from God.

07:31.140 --> 07:35.351
I had to watch it.

07:37.180 --> 07:40.183
I watched pus and bile bubble
out of you.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.186
Here. And here.
Here.

07:43.255 --> 07:47.674
And here for 60 fucking days,

07:47.743 --> 07:51.471
I had to watch the life
leak out of you.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.956
And then you look for
a way to lose it again.

07:54.025 --> 07:56.752
You fucking seek it...

07:56.821 --> 07:58.995
Well, I'm not doing that again.

07:59.064 --> 08:02.136
I am not willing you back
to life the next time you die.

08:02.205 --> 08:03.724
- What was I supposed
to do, Beth?

08:05.692 --> 08:07.694
Let a dozen people
get killed for the change

08:07.763 --> 08:09.558
in their pocket--
- Yes!

08:09.627 --> 08:12.181
Because when you die
everything that you fought for--

08:12.250 --> 08:14.942
and everything that you had me
fight for dies with you.

08:15.011 --> 08:16.047
- I'm not made like that, honey.

08:16.116 --> 08:17.669
- Then get fucking remade!

08:28.404 --> 08:31.027
I fight so hard for you, Dad.

08:31.096 --> 08:32.995
And you do nothing to help me.

08:35.791 --> 08:37.517
You do the opposite.

08:37.586 --> 08:40.036
- I do what's right
in my heart.

08:40.105 --> 08:43.971
What's in my soul
and I won't stop.

08:44.040 --> 08:46.180
I won't stop for anyone
including you.

08:46.249 --> 08:48.010
- You look for justice
everywhere.

08:48.079 --> 08:50.944
Everywhere but the mirror.

08:51.013 --> 08:54.464
Where's the justice for the man
who tried to kill you? Huh?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.606
You will risk your life
for strangers,

08:57.675 --> 09:01.644
but what are you risking to find
the man who fucking did this?

09:01.713 --> 09:03.094
Dad, look at it!

09:13.242 --> 09:15.900
You won't look

09:15.969 --> 09:17.108
because you know who did it.

09:19.662 --> 09:23.390
You have some...

09:23.459 --> 09:26.358
false connection with him.
You think he's your child?

09:26.427 --> 09:29.154
Fine.
No, think it. I don't care.

09:29.223 --> 09:34.366
But your child, he burned
the skin from me.

09:34.435 --> 09:35.747
And you've done nothing
about it...

09:38.578 --> 09:39.648
- It wasn't Jamie.

09:39.717 --> 09:41.960
- Stop lying to yourself.

09:42.029 --> 09:43.272
- It wasn't Jamie.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.518
His name is Terrell Riggins.

09:53.006 --> 09:54.697
He's serving life in prison.

09:57.493 --> 09:59.702
He attacked us to send a
message to rival gang members

09:59.771 --> 10:01.531
that he wasn't weak.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.086
That we didn't destroy him.

10:04.155 --> 10:05.639
He is an animal
trying to convince

10:05.708 --> 10:07.365
other animals he's still strong.

10:08.435 --> 10:09.678
We proved he wasn't.

10:12.439 --> 10:16.270
If he's alive,
and I doubt he is,

10:16.339 --> 10:18.410
he's hiding behind his bunk
with his teeth bared,

10:18.479 --> 10:19.895
waiting to die because
that's what animals do

10:19.964 --> 10:21.137
when they're cornered.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.244
And that animal is cornered.

10:27.523 --> 10:29.870
- So we do nothing about it?

10:29.939 --> 10:33.322
- What are you
asking me, Beth?

10:33.391 --> 10:37.119
You asking me to waste
my life on that piece of shit?

10:42.331 --> 10:43.504
- No, Daddy.

10:45.610 --> 10:47.336
That's what my life's for.

11:05.492 --> 11:07.701
- Beth...

11:14.708 --> 11:16.020
- Hello?

11:16.089 --> 11:18.332
- <i>This is a collect call
from Park County Jail.</i>

11:18.401 --> 11:19.851
<i>Caller, say your name.</i>

11:19.920 --> 11:21.266
<i>- Summer.</i>

11:22.267 --> 11:23.648
- I accept.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.375
<i>- John? The DA's asking
for life in prison.</i>

11:26.444 --> 11:27.756
<i>Life!</i>

11:27.825 --> 11:29.102
- For what?

11:29.171 --> 11:31.276
<i>- Protesting the airport.</i>

11:31.345 --> 11:33.762
- Oh, God. All right.

11:35.625 --> 11:36.972
I'm on my way.
Just stay there.

11:39.146 --> 11:40.734
I'm sorry, that was
a dumb thing to say.

11:41.770 --> 11:42.840
I'm on my way...

11:50.606 --> 11:53.195
<i>- As more information comes out
about the horrific shootout</i>

11:53.264 --> 11:55.749
<i>at the Ruby's Cafe
in Belgrade yesterday,</i>

11:55.818 --> 11:58.200
<i>the assailants have
been identified as members</i>

11:58.269 --> 12:00.581
<i>of a local militia that
has been the subject of</i>

12:00.650 --> 12:03.274
<i>a continued operation between
the Sheriff's department</i>

12:03.343 --> 12:05.310
<i>and Livestock Agents
that has now</i>

12:05.379 --> 12:08.313
<i>taken the life of
Park County's own Sheriff.</i>

12:08.382 --> 12:10.177
<i>The armed robbery interrupted</i>

12:10.246 --> 12:12.283
<i>by Former Livestock
Commissioner John Dutton</i>

12:12.352 --> 12:14.354
<i>would have certainly
led to a greater loss</i>

12:14.423 --> 12:16.874
<i>of innocent life
had he not intervened.</i>

12:16.943 --> 12:20.291
<i>John Dutton's acceptance speech
of Governor Perry's endorsement</i>

12:20.360 --> 12:22.914
<i>seemed odd and out
of touch when he gave it.</i>

12:22.983 --> 12:25.986
<i>Now, it has
the ring of prophecy.</i>

12:26.055 --> 12:29.541
<i>- There is a war being
waged against our way of life.</i>

12:29.610 --> 12:30.922
<i>They will tell you
all the reasons</i>

12:30.991 --> 12:33.753
<i>why our way of life
is bad for Montana.</i>

12:33.822 --> 12:36.203
<i>The ugly truth is
they want the land.</i>

12:36.272 --> 12:40.621
<i>And if they get it, it will
never look like our land again.</i>

12:40.690 --> 12:42.658
<i>That is progress
in today's terms.</i>

12:42.727 --> 12:47.111
<i>So if it's progress you seek,
do not vote for me.</i>

12:47.180 --> 12:49.527
<i>I am the opposite of progress.</i>

12:49.596 --> 12:52.461
<i>I am the wall
that it bashes against.</i>

12:52.530 --> 12:54.981
<i>And I will not
be the one who breaks.</i>

12:55.050 --> 12:57.466
<i>No, Mister Dutton.
It doesn't appear you will.</i>

13:00.296 --> 13:02.920
- Now he gets to be the hero on
top of fucking everything else.

13:02.989 --> 13:04.853
No, no, no...

13:04.922 --> 13:07.303
He just gave you a window.

13:07.372 --> 13:08.857
- What window?

13:08.926 --> 13:10.617
He just secured the vote
of every rancher in the state.

13:10.686 --> 13:11.929
- He already had them.

13:15.484 --> 13:17.141
-
What window?

13:17.210 --> 13:19.522
- He gave you more than that.
He gave you a slogan.

13:19.591 --> 13:22.008
He's the opposite of progress?

13:22.077 --> 13:23.803
You be the face of it.

13:23.872 --> 13:25.459
You are progress.

13:25.528 --> 13:27.185
Progress doesn't want
the people's land.

13:27.254 --> 13:28.600
It wants to preserve it.

13:28.669 --> 13:31.914
Progress wants opportunity
and equality for all.

13:31.983 --> 13:34.952
Ranchers don't
win elections anymore.

13:35.021 --> 13:38.472
All you need is Bozeman,
Missoula, and Helena.

13:38.541 --> 13:41.544
Be the face
of pragmatic progressivism.

13:41.613 --> 13:46.170
Be the bridge and
you will be Governor.

13:46.239 --> 13:47.930
Okay, now is when we
separate from him.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.414
Introduce Montana
to your real father.

13:51.209 --> 13:53.142
- Um...

13:56.525 --> 13:58.320
Hm.

13:58.389 --> 13:59.977
We're just gonna walk
and talk some strategy.

14:00.046 --> 14:01.150
- You do that, son.

14:04.740 --> 14:09.124
- Um... I don't think we want
to bring my father into this.

14:09.193 --> 14:10.919
- Now's the perfect time.

14:10.988 --> 14:12.852
- He was in prison.

14:12.921 --> 14:14.060
- What for?

14:16.821 --> 14:18.374
- Murder.

14:24.691 --> 14:27.107
Who?

14:27.176 --> 14:28.384
Who did he murder?

14:30.593 --> 14:31.594
- My mother.

14:32.595 --> 14:33.838
- Your mother?

14:36.461 --> 14:38.670
And you're just
telling me this now.

14:38.739 --> 14:41.052
- It was 40 years ago.

14:41.121 --> 14:44.676
And he paid his debt.
I have forgiven him.

14:44.745 --> 14:48.784
-
How noble, Jamie.
That's just great.

14:48.853 --> 14:50.027
Do you think the
voters of Montana

14:50.096 --> 14:51.304
are going to forgive him too?

14:51.373 --> 14:53.962
- The voters of Montana
don't need to know.

14:54.031 --> 14:57.310
- How can someone so brilliant
be so fucking stupid?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.625
Your birth certificate
becomes public record

15:02.694 --> 15:04.455
when you run for office.

15:04.524 --> 15:06.250
The RNC will
run a background check

15:06.319 --> 15:08.459
with the sole goal
of digging up dirt

15:08.528 --> 15:10.081
and you just gave them a pile.

15:10.150 --> 15:11.462
Not to mention
what your father plans

15:11.531 --> 15:12.463
to do with this information.

15:12.532 --> 15:14.085
- I have a plan for that.

15:14.154 --> 15:16.432
- The only plan
is to put as much distance

15:16.501 --> 15:19.228
between you and him
as you can.

15:19.297 --> 15:22.369
If you have any interest
in being Governor,

15:22.438 --> 15:26.201
get him out of your house
and get him out of your life.

15:40.042 --> 15:41.526
- She's not wrong, son.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.186
If I'm going to be
a liability for you...

15:46.255 --> 15:48.257
Maybe I better just...

15:48.326 --> 15:50.225
make myself scarce for a while.

15:50.294 --> 15:52.123
- I don't want you to do that.

15:52.192 --> 15:53.745
- I know you don't.

15:53.814 --> 15:56.196
But you just think about
all the times in your life

15:56.265 --> 16:00.960
where what you wanted was
the worst thing for you.

16:34.510 --> 16:37.030
- Not used to seeing you
come in through the front door.

16:37.099 --> 16:41.276
- Yeah.
Might be the first time.

16:41.345 --> 16:43.278
Drug a few in through
the back, though, didn't we?

16:43.347 --> 16:45.004
- That we did.

16:45.073 --> 16:47.144
- Who's Watch Commander?

16:47.213 --> 16:50.871
- Ramsey, till
the end of the day.

16:50.940 --> 16:52.356
- He retiring?

16:52.425 --> 16:54.358
- Appointed him interim Sheriff.

16:54.427 --> 16:56.084
- Not Sam?

16:57.740 --> 16:58.741
- Not Sam.

17:10.408 --> 17:13.032
- John, how are you.

17:13.101 --> 17:16.794
- Well, I'm breathing, Bill.

17:16.863 --> 17:19.279
- At this point
I don't need a statement

17:19.348 --> 17:22.075
from you beyond what we have.

17:22.144 --> 17:24.215
County attorney is
compiling witness statements,

17:24.284 --> 17:26.976
and that's gonna take a while.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.358
- Not why I'm here.

17:29.427 --> 17:30.739
May I sit?

17:30.808 --> 17:32.741
- Please.

17:32.810 --> 17:34.501
- Against my better judgment,

17:34.570 --> 17:37.504
I'm looking into this case
against Summer Higgins.

17:40.404 --> 17:43.269
- Two felony assault
against peace officer charges,

17:43.338 --> 17:46.789
on two separate occasions
which makes it habitual.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.896
There's criminal trespass,
reckless endangerment,

17:49.965 --> 17:51.863
resisting arrest.

17:51.932 --> 17:54.176
- Life in prison, Bill?

17:54.245 --> 17:55.833
- I'm not the prosecutor, John.

17:59.664 --> 18:01.080
- May I see her?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.773
She's a family friend of sorts.

18:05.912 --> 18:07.845
- She's in with
the public defender now.

18:09.157 --> 18:10.606
Want to sit in with them?

18:11.849 --> 18:12.850
- If I could.

18:18.027 --> 18:21.790
- 149263 in Interview One.

18:21.859 --> 18:24.517
Ask the inmate if she would
like John Dutton to join them.

18:29.556 --> 18:30.661
- So, Sheriff.

18:30.730 --> 18:34.113
- <i>Interim Sheriff.</i>

18:34.182 --> 18:36.839
- We both know where that leads.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.531
Big shoes to fill.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.773
- You think so?

18:40.774 --> 18:42.259
- Don't you?

18:42.328 --> 18:45.745
- Donnie was a gambling
addict and an alcoholic

18:45.814 --> 18:49.645
who only protected
and served the highest bidder.

18:49.714 --> 18:51.302
- He was a father.

18:51.371 --> 18:54.305
- Half the men in my jail
are fathers.

19:00.725 --> 19:02.451
On our way.

19:04.246 --> 19:05.661
- I know where it is.

19:05.730 --> 19:08.975
- Things will be different
with me in charge.

19:09.044 --> 19:11.253
- New rules, huh?

19:11.322 --> 19:12.668
- Still the old rules.

19:12.737 --> 19:15.084
But now they'll be enforced.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.948
- Oh.

19:17.017 --> 19:19.088
So the county can
sleep good tonight.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.409
- I will ask that both Class B
felonies be dropped.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.758
In exchange, we don't contest
class D reckless endangerment.

19:33.827 --> 19:35.035
Pull up a seat.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.763
The felony criminal
trespass will likely be

19:38.832 --> 19:40.213
dropped to a misdemeanor.

19:40.282 --> 19:43.975
- I didn't assault him,
I pushed him back.

19:44.044 --> 19:45.322
- That's assault.

19:45.391 --> 19:48.117
- Well, technically,
it's battery.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.811
- Do you want to try the case?

19:51.880 --> 19:53.571
It is termed "assault"
before this court.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.711
- They're making an example of
me, that's what they're doing.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.126
- It's exactly
what they're doing.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.232
And we need to let them,
just a little.

19:59.301 --> 20:01.476
Because there's
no jury of your peers here.

20:01.545 --> 20:02.960
Your peers are in Portland.

20:03.029 --> 20:04.858
And in Portland,
he may be the enemy

20:04.927 --> 20:07.067
or I may be the enemy, but here?

20:07.136 --> 20:09.794
The enemy is you.

20:09.863 --> 20:11.762
We don't want
to go before a jury.

20:11.831 --> 20:13.591
Let me go try
and plea this down.

20:16.491 --> 20:18.631
- Can I talk to him
for a minute, please?

20:18.700 --> 20:19.666
- I'll be outside.

20:27.571 --> 20:29.193
- I can't believe
this is happening.

20:29.262 --> 20:33.232
- Yeah.
Well, it's happening.

20:35.441 --> 20:38.202
- Do you know the judge?
- I know the judge.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.755
- Can you talk to him?

20:39.824 --> 20:43.759
- Let's...
Let's save that card.

20:44.795 --> 20:47.107
- They're asking for life.

20:47.176 --> 20:48.281
- That'll come down.

20:48.350 --> 20:50.456
- To what? 30 years?

20:50.525 --> 20:53.148
I'm going to do
three decades in prison?

20:53.217 --> 20:54.598
My God, I mean...

20:54.667 --> 20:56.324
That's makes you the last guy
I fuck for thirty years!

21:00.086 --> 21:02.916
- Go ahead, you just, uh...

21:02.985 --> 21:04.332
you just bang away
at the old ego.

21:04.401 --> 21:06.403
- That's not what I mean,
I just.

21:07.231 --> 21:08.750
Ugh!

21:10.993 --> 21:12.340
All I did was--

21:12.409 --> 21:16.620
- All you did was assault
two police officers.

21:16.689 --> 21:19.416
And broke a bunch of other laws.

21:19.485 --> 21:21.694
This ain't New York, Summer,
and it ain't L.A.

21:21.763 --> 21:24.144
Our jails aren't overcrowded,
there's plenty of room.

21:24.213 --> 21:26.388
And we are not
afraid to fill them.

21:30.841 --> 21:32.083
But you're not a criminal.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.673
You got so mad
you broke the law.

21:35.742 --> 21:37.192
And they're mad
as hell you did it.

21:37.261 --> 21:39.056
But you're not a criminal,
they know that.

21:39.125 --> 21:41.507
Now let them know you're sorry.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.511
- I'm not sorry.

21:47.754 --> 21:50.447
- Okay, well you...

21:50.516 --> 21:53.173
You'd better get sorry,
and real quick, young lady.

21:53.242 --> 21:54.520
You be mad at the world
when you're free

21:54.589 --> 21:55.969
and far away from here.

21:58.593 --> 22:00.526
- I should have never
listened to your daughter.

22:03.701 --> 22:05.703
- What do you mean?

22:05.772 --> 22:08.188
- She's the one who told
me to protest here.

22:08.257 --> 22:10.052
She said,
"Take one for the team.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.089
Make some noise. Make the news."

22:12.158 --> 22:14.194
Well, I made the news, and
I don't see my fucking team.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.370
- This was Beth's idea?

22:17.439 --> 22:18.785
- Yeah, she's not wrong,

22:18.854 --> 22:21.547
I mean... putting an airport
next to a national park

22:21.616 --> 22:23.928
is barbaric,
but it wasn't my idea

22:23.997 --> 22:25.723
to slap the first cop I saw.

22:26.793 --> 22:27.794
- It was hers.

22:34.732 --> 22:37.390
I'm going to get
you out of this. I promise.

22:40.289 --> 22:43.776
And when I make a promise,
it means something.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.520
What do you think, cooler
heads gonna prevail here?

23:03.589 --> 23:05.314
- Not seeing many cool heads.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.420
They are in a "nip it
in the bud" kind of mood.

23:07.489 --> 23:09.111
I'm going to offer
a big suspended sentence--

23:09.180 --> 23:11.459
15, 20 years,
something that says to them

23:11.528 --> 23:13.081
"She's never coming back."

23:15.635 --> 23:18.362
- Maybe I'll have
a word with the judge.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.779
- I don't know.
That always makes it worse.

23:21.848 --> 23:24.195
- Yeah, well, you can only ask
for favors if you're owed one.

23:25.507 --> 23:26.853
And he owes me one.

23:36.829 --> 23:38.002
- How many times
have you seen it?

23:42.351 --> 23:43.491
- Four.

23:45.285 --> 23:47.046
- What happens after?

23:48.185 --> 23:50.049
- After what?

23:50.118 --> 23:52.223
- In your life.

23:52.292 --> 23:56.055
What happens in your life
after the moment you see it?

23:57.090 --> 23:58.851
- First time I was with my wife.

24:01.543 --> 24:03.994
Second time the Governor came,

24:04.063 --> 24:06.272
asked me to take the appointment
for Livestock Commissioner.

24:07.929 --> 24:09.586
Then I was
with my wife again...

24:09.655 --> 24:10.621
Then the other night.

24:13.935 --> 24:16.662
- When you see the wolf
and your wife together,

24:18.077 --> 24:19.181
what are you doing?

24:20.666 --> 24:22.357
- I'm gonna plead
the fifth on that one.

24:26.706 --> 24:28.121
Last time I saw it,

24:28.190 --> 24:30.917
she came out
and told me she was pregnant.

24:33.195 --> 24:35.232
- The wolf is our protector.

24:35.301 --> 24:38.442
Your spirit animal.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.548
Because in your heart,
you're part wolf, too.

24:42.101 --> 24:44.206
But carrying
the wolf is a burden...

24:45.829 --> 24:47.865
- He is the hunter most hunted.

24:47.934 --> 24:49.177
The killer most killed.

24:50.454 --> 24:53.112
Man and wolf evolved together.

24:53.181 --> 24:54.838
We form packs like they do.

24:56.287 --> 25:00.050
We raid territories
like they do.

25:00.119 --> 25:03.087
Destroy their enemies
like we do.

25:03.156 --> 25:07.160
And we have tried everything
in our power to destroy them.

25:09.438 --> 25:13.581
Before guns and bows, they tried
everything to destroy us.

25:15.652 --> 25:21.381
It is said the wolf exists
to manage the spread of man

25:21.450 --> 25:25.040
and man exists to manage
the spread of the wolf.

25:29.597 --> 25:31.702
- So if we're supposed
to destroy each other...

25:34.015 --> 25:37.190
why is one protecting me?

25:37.259 --> 25:38.467
- I don't know.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.091
You'll have to ask the wolf.

25:43.472 --> 25:44.922
- How do I do that?

25:45.992 --> 25:47.235
- Hanbleceya.

25:48.823 --> 25:51.584
Cry for a vision.

25:51.653 --> 25:54.587
If you cry hard enough,
he might tell you.

25:55.761 --> 25:57.279
- I don't know how.

25:58.626 --> 26:01.629
- Your wife knows how.
I know how.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.564
When you're ready,
we'll teach you.

26:09.982 --> 26:11.362
- I'm ready.

26:35.732 --> 26:37.768
- What are you doing here?

26:37.837 --> 26:40.668
- What are you doing here,
except cheatin' on me?

26:40.737 --> 26:42.704
- How am I cheating on you,
you're still my waitress.

26:42.773 --> 26:44.982
- You didn't know
I worked here too.

26:45.051 --> 26:47.329
That means you were
gonna let some other hussy

26:47.398 --> 26:49.021
bring you lunch.

26:49.090 --> 26:51.264
- Little early to be
flirting, now, idn't it?

26:51.333 --> 26:53.163
- It's a little too
early to follow through,

26:53.232 --> 26:54.578
but it's never
too early to flirt.

26:56.269 --> 26:57.616
Usual?
- Yeah.

27:11.181 --> 27:13.493
- Last time I saw you,
a judge gave you life.

27:16.358 --> 27:18.050
Guess life don't mean
what it used to, does it?

27:22.054 --> 27:25.333
- I spent 30 years...

27:25.402 --> 27:28.163
inside a concrete box

27:28.232 --> 27:33.686
fighting to survive,
fighting to stay sane,

27:33.755 --> 27:37.621
praying that a bird
would fly by my window

27:37.690 --> 27:41.798
so I'd have
proof of some better place

27:41.867 --> 27:44.766
than the hell you put me in.

27:44.835 --> 27:48.459
- Naw, you...
you put yourself in it.

27:48.528 --> 27:51.531
You didn't deserve the bird.

27:51.600 --> 27:57.089
- Hm.
You could've told the truth.

27:57.158 --> 28:00.333
You could've told
them what she'd become--

28:00.402 --> 28:02.128
- She became what you made her.

28:03.958 --> 28:05.407
And then you killed her for it.

28:07.375 --> 28:09.377
I raised your
son with love and respect,

28:09.446 --> 28:12.552
and I made him what he is today.

28:12.621 --> 28:17.488
If he chooses to let you
unmake it, I can't stop that.

28:21.665 --> 28:24.219
But if your plan
is to get me back

28:24.288 --> 28:26.014
for what you did to yourself,

28:26.083 --> 28:29.190
I will treat you like
everyone else who showed up

28:29.259 --> 28:31.606
with the same idea,

28:31.675 --> 28:33.781
and I will rid
the fucking world of you.

28:36.093 --> 28:39.200
Best Salisbury Steak in Montana.
You enjoy it.

28:41.305 --> 28:43.722
'Cause you never know which
meal will be your last.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.186
How long you
gonna be gone?

29:02.085 --> 29:03.845
A whole week.

29:03.914 --> 29:06.054
- Mm. You're gonna miss me.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.126
- Yeah, it's gonna
be hard on you,

29:09.195 --> 29:10.576
but I need you to stay strong.

29:10.645 --> 29:14.338
- I'm being serious.
I have that effect on people.

29:14.407 --> 29:17.963
The symptoms,

29:18.032 --> 29:23.623
some serious melancholy,
shortness of breath,

29:23.692 --> 29:25.936
extreme discomfort
in the groin area.

29:26.005 --> 29:28.076
- Okay, so loving you is kind
of like a venereal disease.

29:28.145 --> 29:30.630
- Oh, look at you.

29:30.699 --> 29:32.529
Using the L word,
just a week in.

29:32.598 --> 29:34.911
- Fuck.

29:34.980 --> 29:36.360
- Yeah, you're so hooked.

29:36.429 --> 29:38.500
- Yeah, I'm in over my head,
that's for sure.

29:38.569 --> 29:39.501
- Pussy-whipped is what it is.

29:39.570 --> 29:40.744
- I think you're pecker-whipped.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.539
- Pecker-whipped?
- Pecker-whipped.

29:42.608 --> 29:44.265
- Okay, so now you're
just making up words.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.476
All right, I might be
a little pecker-whipped.

29:48.545 --> 29:51.203
But you are pussy-whipped.

29:51.272 --> 29:52.894
- To my very core.

29:55.932 --> 29:57.623
- How am I different
from the barrel racer?

29:59.245 --> 30:00.419
- Really, no segue at all?

30:00.488 --> 30:01.627
Just straight
to the serious stuff?

30:01.696 --> 30:04.319
- Not serious.
Just curious.

30:10.153 --> 30:12.120
- I think that...

30:12.189 --> 30:15.675
she liked...
the potential in me.

30:18.333 --> 30:19.748
I never really got it.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.129
Sure as hell
didn't live up to it.

30:24.305 --> 30:26.825
But it seems like you like me
for who I am right now.

30:26.894 --> 30:30.104
- I do.

30:30.173 --> 30:32.692
My standards are low.
-

30:38.422 --> 30:40.079
I think it's hard
to lose someone

30:40.148 --> 30:43.945
who thinks you let them down

30:44.014 --> 30:45.326
'cause there's no way
to prove 'em wrong.

30:47.293 --> 30:48.916
Even if you do,
they ain't around to see it.

30:52.195 --> 30:54.231
But I ain't here
to set standards for you.

30:56.164 --> 30:57.303
Gotta set those for yourself.

31:01.618 --> 31:02.930
Yeah, I wish you
weren't leaving.

31:05.277 --> 31:06.519
- Me, too.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.249
- Feels good to miss
someone again, though.

31:16.081 --> 31:17.220
- Yeah. It does.

- Tammy Joe,
when you put him up,

34:30.551 --> 34:33.140
help Kelby get
Crazy Horse put together,

34:33.209 --> 34:35.556
and I need that
Smart Shiny Lights.

34:35.625 --> 34:38.283
Or Sweet Shiny... the fucking
sorrel, the seven year old.

34:38.352 --> 34:39.905
- Yes.
- I don't know his fucking name.

34:39.974 --> 34:41.458
What's up, brother?

34:41.527 --> 34:42.908
- Hell of a run, brother.

34:42.977 --> 34:45.566
- Oh, shit. Thank you.
We'll see if it sticks.

34:45.635 --> 34:47.050
- Oh, shit, it'll stick.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.432
- Well, I'm just gonna assume
you want one of these.

34:49.501 --> 34:52.331
- Absolutely.
-

34:52.400 --> 34:53.815
- There you go, cheers.
- Cheers, man.

34:55.955 --> 34:57.681
- Well, if it ain't
the bronc buster.

34:59.235 --> 35:00.305
- Congratulations.

35:00.374 --> 35:02.341
That was, uh...

35:02.410 --> 35:03.687
That was beautiful.

35:03.756 --> 35:05.033
I don't know
another word for it.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.139
- Well, thank you.

35:07.208 --> 35:09.521
The Sixes got you
hauling horses?

35:09.590 --> 35:10.625
- Boyd was a little shorthanded

35:10.694 --> 35:11.695
so they sent me
down here to help.

35:11.764 --> 35:13.249
- That a fact?

35:15.354 --> 35:17.011
Well, Jimmy, I guess you
must've learned quite a bit

35:17.080 --> 35:18.323
if they sent you to help here.

35:20.359 --> 35:22.120
- Hey, you were right.

35:22.189 --> 35:23.155
'Bout everything.

35:24.743 --> 35:27.539
It's just you and a horse.
That's all there is.

35:27.608 --> 35:30.162
This old timer
told me that, uh...

35:30.231 --> 35:31.853
cowboyin's an art
without an audience.

35:31.922 --> 35:33.717
But guess he was wrong.

35:33.786 --> 35:36.134
Pretty big audience out there.

35:36.203 --> 35:39.654
- Oh, shit, Jimmy. This isn't...
this ain't cowboying.

35:39.723 --> 35:41.829
This is...
This is just showing off.

35:41.898 --> 35:43.589
That's all it is.

35:43.658 --> 35:45.004
I mean, it's a lot of fun

35:45.073 --> 35:47.731
and when it pays, it pays good,
but it is not cowboying.

35:49.699 --> 35:52.357
The best ride of my life,

35:52.426 --> 35:56.257
the best cow I ever worked was
in a field in San Saba, Texas,

35:56.326 --> 35:57.845
and nobody saw it.

35:57.914 --> 35:59.743
Not a soul.

35:59.812 --> 36:01.883
So your old timer was right.

36:04.092 --> 36:06.750
- Mine was a steer that didn't
want to cross the Wichita.

36:06.819 --> 36:07.993
- I know the river,
and I know the steer.

36:09.581 --> 36:11.238
- Hey, guys, they're bringing
in Metallic Cat.

36:11.307 --> 36:12.791
- Oh, shit.

36:12.860 --> 36:15.103
Come with me, Jimmy,
this will interest you.

36:16.588 --> 36:20.212
<i>The 2021 NRCHA
Snaffle Bit Futurity</i>

36:20.281 --> 36:23.422

36:23.491 --> 36:28.634
<i>and NRCHA with over 37 million

36:28.703 --> 36:30.636
<i>Let's have a big
Ft. Worth welcome</i>

36:30.705 --> 36:32.742
<i>for the NCHA stallion

36:32.811 --> 36:34.847
<i>Metallic Cat.</i>

36:36.470 --> 36:38.299

the Yellowstone Dutton ranch</i>

36:41.820 --> 36:43.546
<i>in Paradise Valley, Montana.</i>

36:43.615 --> 36:45.306
- Wait, the Yellowstone
bought Metallic Cat?

36:45.375 --> 36:47.308
- Half owners.

36:47.377 --> 36:49.621
If you're wanting to get
into this game, buddy,

36:49.690 --> 36:53.418
you're gonna have
your pick of the litter.

36:53.487 --> 36:54.902
I'm gonna have you drive him
back when we're done.

36:57.076 --> 36:58.181
- Wait, when are we
heading back?

36:58.250 --> 37:00.528
- Right after
the dispersal sale.

37:00.597 --> 37:04.118
School's over, Jimmy,
and you came out of it a cowboy.

37:04.187 --> 37:06.154
- Hey, Travis, we're going
to the bar. You coming?

37:06.224 --> 37:07.915
- Oh shit, you don't have
to ask me twice.

37:32.077 --> 37:33.803
- You weren't supposed
to be here yet.

37:42.950 --> 37:44.331
Don't look too happy
to see me.

37:46.022 --> 37:48.473
- The Sixes is sending
me back to Montana.

37:48.542 --> 37:49.922
My contract's up.

37:51.683 --> 37:54.444
- If it's up, they
can't send you anywhere.

37:54.513 --> 37:56.757
Just try the Pitchfork.
Hell, it's next door.

37:56.826 --> 37:59.173
- I love how thirty miles away
is next door here.

37:59.242 --> 38:00.933
No, I...

38:01.002 --> 38:03.177
I owe him.

38:03.246 --> 38:05.593
John Dutton.
I gave him my word.

38:08.907 --> 38:10.357
- I respect that.

38:12.082 --> 38:13.636
Hate hearing it,
but I respect it.

38:16.639 --> 38:18.537
Man, life refuses to play fair.

38:20.850 --> 38:22.369
- Ain't played fair with me yet.

38:22.438 --> 38:23.784
- Me neither.

38:28.133 --> 38:30.825
We'd better rip this band aid
off quick then.

38:37.763 --> 38:39.006
Goodbye, Jimmy.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.716
- Thanks.

39:05.515 --> 39:06.930
- We're eating in
the dining room tonight.

39:08.311 --> 39:11.141
- Why are we eating
in the dining room?

39:11.210 --> 39:13.696
- 'Cause I like eating in here.

39:13.765 --> 39:15.249
But you and I aren't
going to like this dinner.

39:22.705 --> 39:24.258
- Shall we?

39:24.327 --> 39:26.778
- Not on your life, sweetheart.

39:26.847 --> 39:28.987
Tell you what? Let's go around
to the bunkhouse

39:29.056 --> 39:30.644
and we see what the boys
are making for supper. Come on.

39:30.713 --> 39:33.301
- Discretion's
the better part of valor.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.993
- Ain't that the fucking truth.

39:36.546 --> 39:39.825
Well, Beth, you
have a good time, hon.

39:39.894 --> 39:41.275
- Quitter.

39:42.483 --> 39:45.072
- Come find me
after your ass whipping.

39:45.141 --> 39:47.626
- You forget
who you're marrying?

39:47.695 --> 39:49.594
- There's always a bigger
bear, darling.

40:07.819 --> 40:09.130
- Have a seat.

40:11.478 --> 40:12.582
- I fight standing.

40:14.722 --> 40:16.068
- This isn't a fight.

40:16.137 --> 40:18.657
- The fuck it's not.
Come on, let me have it.

40:18.726 --> 40:20.763
- If you were one of my sons--

40:20.832 --> 40:21.764
- You'd what?

40:21.833 --> 40:24.145
Brand me? Fight me?
Huh?

40:24.214 --> 40:26.838
Don't treat me any different,
you want to brawl, let's brawl.

40:26.907 --> 40:29.081
- You done?

40:29.150 --> 40:31.290
Or you need a little more
time to psych yourself

40:31.359 --> 40:33.292
into being right.

40:33.361 --> 40:35.156
Or are you just throwing
a tantrum for no reason

40:35.225 --> 40:36.951
because if this wants
to be a contest

40:37.020 --> 40:39.298
about who can lose
their composure the most

40:39.367 --> 40:41.784
I will put this table
through the fucking wall.

40:45.201 --> 40:48.515
Or you and I can sit down and
have a conversation like adults.

40:59.940 --> 41:01.562
You used that girl.

41:04.565 --> 41:06.740
You used her and now
she's facing prison.

41:06.809 --> 41:09.536
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:09.605 --> 41:11.779
- Well, that's life
in the Serengeti, Dad.

41:13.540 --> 41:15.576
- What we do to our enemies
we do to our enemies.

41:15.645 --> 41:20.236
That woman is not our enemy.

41:20.305 --> 41:23.860
- The thought was complete
before you mentioned the woman.

41:23.929 --> 41:27.864
I do anything
to hurt our enemies, Dad,

41:27.933 --> 41:30.902
If I hurt others, so be it.

41:30.971 --> 41:32.800
I don't care.

41:32.869 --> 41:34.388
I don't care
if she dies in prison.

41:34.457 --> 41:37.874
I don't care if she gets out,
I do not fucking care, okay?

41:37.943 --> 41:39.704
I care about you,
I care about Kayce,

41:39.773 --> 41:41.499
I care about Rip.

41:43.052 --> 41:44.916
- Well, if you care about them
then you need to care

41:44.985 --> 41:46.952
about having some morality
in the way you fight.

41:49.437 --> 41:51.819
- There's no such thing.
Not in a kingdom.

41:51.888 --> 41:53.821
And that's what this is.

41:53.890 --> 41:57.376
There is no morality
here, Dad, none.

41:57.445 --> 42:00.448
There is keep the kingdom
or there is lose the kingdom.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.727
Or break your
fucking promise, Dad.

42:02.796 --> 42:05.868
Break it and sell this place.

42:05.937 --> 42:08.111
Take the money,
buy up half of Oklahoma

42:08.180 --> 42:10.389
and run cattle for
the next 20 generations

42:10.458 --> 42:13.151
where no one gives a fuck
about you or your land.

42:14.186 --> 42:16.982
- My kingdom, my rules.

42:17.051 --> 42:19.744
We fight with dignity.
You aren't.

42:19.813 --> 42:21.815
You start or find another fight.

42:24.645 --> 42:26.440
- What does that mean?

42:26.509 --> 42:28.856
- I'm saying no more collateral
damage, you understand me?

42:30.409 --> 42:33.551
We don't kill sheep.
We kill wolves.

42:35.518 --> 42:37.693
What you did was cruel, honey.

42:37.762 --> 42:39.418
- Because you fucked her,
it's cruel?

42:39.487 --> 42:41.904
- Did you do it
because I fucked her?

42:43.561 --> 42:44.976
Because that is cruel.

42:46.115 --> 42:47.703
Goddam, Beth, I never
thought I'd feel

42:47.772 --> 42:49.394
this way about you before,

42:49.463 --> 42:53.225
but you have really
disappointed me, honey.

42:53.294 --> 42:55.365
And I never thought
I'd say that about you.

42:59.438 --> 43:00.716
- Me neither.

43:05.237 --> 43:09.656
- You know, maybe it's best
if I fight this alone.

43:09.725 --> 43:11.312
Maybe it's best if you
go somewhere else

43:11.381 --> 43:12.486
while I do it.

43:14.281 --> 43:15.593
- This is my home.

43:18.492 --> 43:20.183
- Might be time
to find another one.

43:51.076 --> 43:52.526
- Got 'em all sorted, huh?

43:52.595 --> 43:54.424
- Yep.

43:54.493 --> 43:57.013
- Sale's done?
- Yep.

44:00.189 --> 44:03.054
- Goodbyes are too hard, Jimmy.
That's why I said it quick.

44:03.123 --> 44:05.021
Let's not do this.

44:05.090 --> 44:07.575
- I'm not saying goodbye.

44:07.645 --> 44:08.956
I'm keeping you.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.029
I'll day work, I'll do
what I have to do.

44:13.098 --> 44:15.894
- Can't let you break
your word over me.

44:15.963 --> 44:18.103
It'll be the thing that breaks
us, then you'll have nothing.

44:20.830 --> 44:23.143
Keep your word.

44:23.212 --> 44:24.316
Then come back to me.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.840
If you ask me to wait,
I'll wait...

44:30.909 --> 44:32.255
- Wait for me.

44:33.912 --> 44:35.120
- Okay.

What, did you buy him

Poker circus?
That's disrespectful.

46:00.205 --> 46:02.483
- Come on, son.

46:02.552 --> 46:05.555
- It's down to the kid
and the unluckiest card player
on earth now.

46:05.624 --> 46:07.626
- I wonder how
that's gonna work out.

46:07.695 --> 46:09.697

I'm wondering what
else it's gonna cost me.

46:40.245 --> 46:41.453
Do you know any sad songs?

46:42.661 --> 46:44.146
- Most people say that's
all I know.

46:48.598 --> 46:49.945
- Would you play one for me?

46:52.879 --> 46:54.087
- Yeah, I can do that.

46:54.156 --> 46:55.260
What, you got boat?

her tongue or something?

funny back there?

talking shit at the same time.

Let's do it.

47:33.505 --> 47:36.439
- The same exact cards

- If you're so sad, how about
I play you something happy?

47:46.415 --> 47:49.107
- No. I need to cry.

47:52.559 --> 47:54.941
But I'm incapable
of crying for myself.

47:55.010 --> 47:58.151
Walker, I need a song
to cry to.

48:01.637 --> 48:04.709
- This is about a man
who got killed that...

48:04.778 --> 48:05.883
wasn't quite ready to die.

48:07.850 --> 48:11.923
Guess as his soul
was floating up in the air

48:11.992 --> 48:15.754
he's looking down on all
the things he was gonna miss.

48:15.823 --> 48:17.722
Pretty sure he cried.

50:31.718 --> 50:32.719

50:35.411 --> 50:36.964

51:06.787 --> 51:07.892
- Gotta be honest.

51:10.481 --> 51:12.483
Not sure I believe
in all this.

good's trying to happen

Your only safe place
is inside your prayer ties.

51:26.152 --> 51:27.774
Your only protection
is the pipe.

51:31.433 --> 51:34.160
Everything else
around you could be evil.

51:35.747 --> 51:40.476

No food.
No water.

51:50.348 --> 51:51.591
- No water?

51:51.660 --> 51:53.386
- None.

51:53.455 --> 51:54.870
- I'll die.

51:54.939 --> 51:56.975
- You must stand
on the cliff of death

51:57.044 --> 52:00.669
to understand
your purpose in life.

52:00.738 --> 52:02.740
It's the only place
where you can see it.

52:13.682 --> 52:15.097
She's a good woman.

52:17.858 --> 52:19.032
- Better than I deserve.

52:20.067 --> 52:22.449
- God doesn't work like that.

52:22.518 --> 52:25.521
He would never let her love
someone who didn't deserve her.

53:12.844 --> 53:14.191
- I feel kinda silly.

53:15.468 --> 53:17.366
- Listen to Mo.

53:17.435 --> 53:19.610
Do what he says
exactly as he says it.

53:22.440 --> 53:23.786
I love you.

53:31.277 --> 53:32.623
- See you in a few days.

54:50.563 --> 54:53.428
Use the sage to keep
bad spirits off.

54:53.497 --> 54:56.293
Use the sweet grass to call
your spirit helpers in.

54:57.570 --> 55:00.193
Smoke the pipe when you pray.
Understand?

55:03.196 --> 55:06.372
- You'll be surprised
how quickly you'll replay

55:06.441 --> 55:09.306
all your moments
in life in your mind.

55:09.375 --> 55:11.860
And then what?

55:11.929 --> 55:16.140
When you are without memories,
without regrets to ponder,

55:16.209 --> 55:20.938
without fantasies
to embrace or to reject,

55:21.007 --> 55:23.837
what will you think of then?

55:23.906 --> 55:26.737
What will come to you depends

55:26.806 --> 55:30.568
on how hard you pray
and how much you suffer.

55:32.432 --> 55:33.847
Close him in, Mo.

55:50.312 --> 55:51.865
- How will you know
when I'm done?

55:53.142 --> 55:54.765
- How will you know, Kayce?

55:57.319 --> 55:58.562
That is the question.
