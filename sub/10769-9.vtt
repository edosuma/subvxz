00:36.870 --> 00:38.735
What the hell are you doing down here?

00:38.905 --> 00:42.363
Oh, um, I thought
I heard somebody breaking in.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.073
What you doing down here?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.313
Uh, the same thing.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.241
Pie's in the fridge.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.714
Yep.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.583
Nothing like sneaking a little pie
before Thanksgiving.

00:56.756 --> 00:59.088
- Shh! Shh!
- Don't shush me.

00:59.259 --> 01:02.057
This is not
the first Philip Banks pie-jacking.

01:02.228 --> 01:08.963
Son, son, I have been jacking pies since,
what, Thanksgiving 1953.

01:09.135 --> 01:11.603
Rhubarb. Tart little thing.

01:11.771 --> 01:14.137
1954, I got sloppy. Got busted.

01:14.307 --> 01:17.572
1955, we got a dog. Sparkie.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.542
From then on, the dog ate the pie.

01:23.516 --> 01:25.245
Hey.

01:25.852 --> 01:29.583
So I guess it's your nose
I should've been shoving in the pan.

01:30.023 --> 01:34.084
Well, actually, keeping his nose out of the
pan would have been more of a punishment.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.659
Get off of me.

01:36.529 --> 01:39.362
Mother. My sweet Mommy.

01:39.532 --> 01:40.999
Come on, Mom. Ha-ha-ha.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.635
I've got a few secrets of my own.

01:43.803 --> 01:48.900
I have been stashing away a pie or two ever
since I saw the size of your sweet tooth.

01:49.075 --> 01:52.977
Oh. Grandma Hattie, the pie hider.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.170
Aah!

01:55.348 --> 01:58.875
- I suppose the dog ate this one too.
- I ain't had nothing to do with it.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.316
- He ate it.
- You always trying to blame somebody.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.012
- Out of here. Both of you.
- Momma.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.157
- Just out of the kitchen. Out.
- He did it.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.384
Out. Out. Out.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.206
Well, it's off to the shelter.

03:36.382 --> 03:40.512
Oh, honey. I think it's wonderful that you're
helping the less fortunate on Thanksgiving.

03:40.687 --> 03:45.090
I guess. Did I tell you that Channel Four is
sending a camera crew down to cover this?

03:45.258 --> 03:47.818
<i>God knows that The Hilary Show
could use some publicity.</i>

03:48.261 --> 03:51.697
There is no limit to your giving,
is there, Miss Hilary?

03:51.864 --> 03:54.230
Thank you, Geoffrey, that's so sweet.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.593
All set?

03:57.770 --> 03:59.203
I'm not going.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.364
Wait. Carlton, didn't you call down
to the shelter and volunteer?

04:02.542 --> 04:04.874
I called down and put my name
on a volunteer list.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.376
But I'm not physically going down there.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.216
But don't worry,
it'll still look good on my résumé.

04:11.384 --> 04:14.911
Carlton, if you said you were going down
to help, you get down there.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.420
But, Mom, I can't drive
through that part of town.

04:17.589 --> 04:20.218
There are homeless people down there.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.460
Okay, fine.

04:22.629 --> 04:26.292
But before I go, I'm taking the pennies out
of my loafers.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.199
Hey, where they at?

04:31.037 --> 04:32.265
Hey.

04:32.438 --> 04:36.670
Oh, my goodness.
You get prettier every year, sweetie.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.572
It's like looking in a mirror.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.174
Carlton.

04:43.349 --> 04:46.580
I'm sorry we have to go, but they're
expecting us down at the shelter.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.482
- Oh, okay.
- Okay. We'll see you later.

04:48.655 --> 04:51.180
- All right. Bye-bye.
All right, all right.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.053
Hear that, Vy?
They're off to help at the shelter.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.525
- Oh.
- Isn't she a saint?

04:56.696 --> 04:59.460
A regular Mother Teresa.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.957
How was the trip?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.763
- Oh, well, a little bumpy.
- Turbulence?

05:04.937 --> 05:08.737
No, no, no. For five hours straight,
Helen never stopped moving.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.877
Well, that's why I've always
had a boyfriend.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.172
You know that's right.

05:14.647 --> 05:18.174
Hattie girl, you look younger
every time I see you.

05:18.351 --> 05:20.148
Oh, you're just saying that.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.652
Oh, but don't feel you have to stop.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.081
Hi, Aunt Vy. Hi, Aunt Helen.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.352
- Ashley.
- Oh, Ashley, sweetie pie.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.018
- Hello.
- How you doing?

05:30.196 --> 05:34.064
I guess you're gonna be rolling up those
sleeves and helping us in the kitchen?

05:34.233 --> 05:37.100
I can't wait to get elbow deep
in them turkey gizzards.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.028
Honey, you need to get cable.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.873
Just because I'm a woman, I'm suppose
to don an apron on Thanksgiving?

05:44.043 --> 05:45.203
I don't think so.

05:46.045 --> 05:50.175
Well, I guess somebody burned
their training bra.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.843
Aunt Helen,
you ever heard of traveling light?

05:55.021 --> 05:57.080
And that's probably just her makeup.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.592
- Oh, sweetie, is it your back?
- Yeah.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.662
I told you the pressures of that trial
were gonna get to you.

06:04.831 --> 06:07.322
- Are you okay, son?
- Yeah. I'll be all right, Momma.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.901
Good. Now, get that trunk out of here.
We need this space to cook in.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.970
And I gotta get back to my stuffing.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.931
Wait, no.
You made the stuffing last year.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.669
That's because you were sick.
This is my natural turn.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.439
Well, wait a minute.
It's my turn to make it after you.

06:21.614 --> 06:24.606
Okay. Now you're guests in my house.
I'll make the stuffing.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.581
Besides, everybody loves it.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.745
Funny, I don't remember voting.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.590
Uh, no offense, you guys...

06:31.758 --> 06:35.023
...but none of you can hold a candle
to my stuffing.

06:35.194 --> 06:38.823
That's because it's so dry,
it'd go up in flames.

06:39.265 --> 06:43.224
All I know is, I've been making my stuffing
for Philip since he was a boy.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.337
And he always asks for more.

06:45.505 --> 06:48.872
Oh, we all know what a picky eater he is.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.976
Now, Will. Will.
You grew up on my stuffing.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.614
Now, you tell everybody who's the best.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.443
- Oh, well, come on, Mom...
- Uh-uh-uh!

06:57.617 --> 07:00.347
Excuse us. Son. Son, come here.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.148
Let me give you
a little piece of advice, huh?

07:03.322 --> 07:06.291
Never take sides
when women are arguing.

07:06.459 --> 07:07.687
You can't win.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.689
Well, Uncle Phil, this is my mom.
I think it'll be all right.

07:11.864 --> 07:14.298
Look at me, boy.

07:14.467 --> 07:19.200
Lesson number one,
whatever you say is wrong.

07:21.174 --> 07:24.735
We're all family here, Uncle Phil.
I don't think it's quite that serious.

07:25.178 --> 07:29.615
Well, Mom, I think that your stuffing
is the best in the world.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.080
- Yes.
- What?

07:32.552 --> 07:33.712
Oh, I mean... I'm saying...

07:33.886 --> 07:38.152
At least that's what I thought before
I tried Grandma Hattie's herb stuffing.

07:38.324 --> 07:39.348
Whoo!

07:39.525 --> 07:43.052
Hey, what is it in there, the rosemary
that just drives me crazy?

07:43.229 --> 07:45.129
What?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.322
Um...

07:46.499 --> 07:52.233
Well, I mean, nothing compares to
Aunt Helen's mushroom and bacon stuffing.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.805
Ain't that right, Uncle Phil?

07:55.775 --> 07:57.766
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.237
Will?

08:00.947 --> 08:02.073
Well, Aunt Viv.

08:02.248 --> 08:07.447
I mean, when I first tried
your apricot stuffing I was like, "Whoo!"

08:07.620 --> 08:11.215
Ain't that right, Uncle Phil? Heh.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.122
You gonna leave me hanging out here
like this, huh?

08:20.967 --> 08:22.662
How about y'all make them all?

08:23.302 --> 08:24.997
- That's a good idea.
- Hey, yes.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.571
- Okay, I'm for that.
- I guess I'll get to cook this year.

08:29.575 --> 08:32.806
And you can judge which is best.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.875
The both of you.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.158
Oh, my God.

08:50.329 --> 08:53.230
Have you ever seen so many fashion don'ts
in one room?

08:53.933 --> 08:55.525
Okay, Hill. Look, here's the plan.

08:56.135 --> 08:58.899
We get in, do our good deed and get out.

08:59.071 --> 09:00.436
Great.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.733
Wait, I don't see the camera crew
anywhere.

09:02.909 --> 09:06.436
- Excuse me. Could you help me?
- The food's over there.

09:06.612 --> 09:09.012
But I'll save a seat for you.

09:10.182 --> 09:11.945
Beauty is such a curse.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.176
Relax.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.946
You have to be patient with these people.
Understanding.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.818
- Excuse me.
- Hey, pal. Can't you see I'm talking?

09:18.991 --> 09:20.959
I'm Larry Wilmore. The shelter manager.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.789
Manager? Carlton Banks here.

09:23.963 --> 09:27.091
Wow, you're awfully young
to have such an important position.

09:27.266 --> 09:29.097
And fit too.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.496
You work out, don't you?

09:31.237 --> 09:36.140
So, Lare, listen. I've taken the liberty of
drafting up a little letter of recommendation.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.743
So if you'd be kind enough
to put your John Hancock...

09:38.911 --> 09:42.142
The film crew called and they said
they're gonna be a little delayed.

09:42.315 --> 09:45.910
But in the meantime, Sylvia over there
will give you your jobs.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.110
Oh, don't be silly. I already have a job.

09:48.287 --> 09:49.948
I'm a famous talk-show hostess.

09:50.122 --> 09:54.058
Well, not exactly famous but I would be
if more people watched my show.

09:54.226 --> 09:57.218
But really, how famous was Oprah
before she was famous?

09:57.396 --> 09:58.420
Sylvia.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.793
Uh, Hilary and Carlton need
their assignments.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.532
And I suddenly need my medication.
Excuse me.

10:04.503 --> 10:05.993
We'll talk later, Lare.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.834
Okay. Here you go.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.236
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm already fully accessorized.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.579
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.415
Oh, man.

10:23.589 --> 10:26.456
He can't catch a cold.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.953
Phil, I need you and Will
to move that luggage upstairs.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.494
Relax. Relax.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.996
Right after this play, sweetheart.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.098
That should give us
at least another half hour.

10:39.505 --> 10:42.736
You know, I once told her
that the Fiesta Bowl was a three-day event.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.933
I didn't have to do anything all weekend.

10:46.612 --> 10:49.809
Nicky, we are learning from the master.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.383
Holidays are the reason
they should've passed the ERA.

10:53.886 --> 10:56.354
Give it a rest.

10:57.623 --> 11:01.354
Ooh.
The student has become the teacher.

11:07.833 --> 11:11.269
All right. Vy, I'm gonna need this area
to chop up my onions.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.905
No, no, no.
Not before I chop up my parsley.

11:14.073 --> 11:16.837
I don't want your onions
ruining my stuffing.

11:17.009 --> 11:21.537
Believe me, you don't need my onions
to ruin your stuffing.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.778
Children, please.

11:23.949 --> 11:26.349
Just like you, moving in on somebody.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.884
You're the one to talk.

11:28.054 --> 11:30.113
I had my own room
before you came along.

11:30.289 --> 11:31.950
Why don't you let that go?

11:32.124 --> 11:34.718
You hold on to things like a rottweiler.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.153
Now, why did you have to go there?

11:37.329 --> 11:39.797
What are you talking about,
"holding on to something"?

11:39.965 --> 11:41.796
I'm glad I never had daughters.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.926
Just push your little onions
right over there.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.503
You can't make no...

11:46.672 --> 11:49.163
Did you move that luggage yet?

11:50.409 --> 11:52.536
We'll get it right after this play,
Aunt Viv.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.509
Now!

11:56.916 --> 11:58.315
What'd I do wrong?

11:58.484 --> 12:01.476
You didn't believe.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.748
- Come on, let's get this big piece first.
- All right.

12:06.525 --> 12:07.787
Count of three, Uncle Phil.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.587
- Okay. Take it easy now.
- All right.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.593
Ready? Okay. One, two...

12:12.965 --> 12:15.365
Oh, come on, man. Look at this stu...

12:15.534 --> 12:17.126
I don't believe this guy.

12:17.903 --> 12:22.340
Mommy, Daddy's fallen
and he can't get up.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.203
What happened?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.449
Philip, what happened?

12:34.787 --> 12:37.153
Oh, my back.
My back went completely out.

12:37.323 --> 12:40.019
Oh, honey, I'll call the doctor.

12:40.526 --> 12:41.652
Why didn't you lift?

12:41.827 --> 12:43.419
Uncle Phil, you never said, three.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.996
I did say three. I said, one, two, three.

12:46.866 --> 12:50.632
No, you didn't, Uncle Phil.
You said, "One, two." But then when...

12:50.936 --> 12:53.404
I said, three.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.603
Oh, God. I just need to lie down.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.337
- Here. Let me give you a hand.
- Don't touch me.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.045
Philip, honey, what happened in here?

13:03.215 --> 13:06.048
Oh, my poor baby.

13:06.218 --> 13:07.310
Can I get you anything?

13:07.486 --> 13:09.545
I'll take a gin and tonic.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.553
Could somebody put a pillow
under my legs, please?

13:12.725 --> 13:13.953
Of course.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.454
Oh, my stuffing.

13:20.766 --> 13:24.293
Honey, I just talked to Dr. Selkin.
He can't see you until Monday morning.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.529
His physical therapist
is available tomorrow.

13:26.705 --> 13:28.900
Oh, well, I guess
I just have to wait, then.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.405
Oh, honey, just lay here.

13:30.576 --> 13:33.238
If you need anything,
I'll be in the kitchen.

13:33.412 --> 13:34.970
You cannot trust those women.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.605
Oh, no, but, Viv... Viv... Vivian, you just...

13:39.985 --> 13:41.953
Get away from me.

13:42.254 --> 13:44.722
Look, Uncle Phil,
you're obviously in pain, man.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.016
Why wait until tomorrow?

13:46.192 --> 13:49.457
I say we hop in the car, head down
to one of them acu-pressure places.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.687
I don't think so.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.262
Yeah, yeah.
You're probably right, Uncle Phil.

13:55.434 --> 14:00.838
And, you know, tonight, while we're all
in the dining room having turkey...

14:01.006 --> 14:04.874
...and four different kinds of stuffing
and mashed potatoes...

14:05.044 --> 14:08.013
...and sweet potato pie, cranberry sauce...
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

14:08.180 --> 14:12.378
And little tiny onions...

14:12.551 --> 14:15.816
...swimming in a sea of cream sauce.

14:15.988 --> 14:18.786
Yeah, you gonna be right here
on the couch.

14:18.958 --> 14:22.416
But that's all right. Don't worry about it.
I'll have a word with Geoffrey.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.393
Have him mix you up,
like, a turkey smoothie.

14:25.564 --> 14:28.692
Well... Well, now, Will, l...

14:28.968 --> 14:30.060
I am in pain.

14:30.236 --> 14:33.728
Yeah, that's right, Uncle Phil.
Let's get in the car, let's head down there.

14:33.906 --> 14:34.998
Okay, okay. Careful now.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.165
- All right. On three.
- Count of three. Okay.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.278
Ready? One, two, three.

14:40.446 --> 14:43.415
- Oh, come on.
- Aah!

14:47.052 --> 14:49.782
That time, you definitely said three.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.723
Hey, can you hook me up
with some more potatoes?

14:58.898 --> 15:02.026
Move it along.
Everyone gets the same amount.

15:02.568 --> 15:06.265
But I'm a growing boy. Just because
somebody stunted your growth...

15:06.438 --> 15:08.531
...doesn't mean you need
to take it out on me.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.508
Is that a short joke?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.845
Why, did it go over your head?

15:15.281 --> 15:16.942
Now, that was a short joke.

15:17.883 --> 15:20.283
Look, you mangy little rapscallion...

15:20.452 --> 15:23.148
Hey, Mr. Wilmore.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.813
I'm just giving the customers
what they want.

15:25.991 --> 15:28.152
How about some more turkey,
young fella?

15:28.327 --> 15:29.851
Just tell me when.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.053
What are you doing?

15:31.997 --> 15:34.022
This food has to feed everybody.

15:34.199 --> 15:38.329
For somebody who wants to go to
Princeton, I'd expect more common sense.

15:39.405 --> 15:40.463
Hey.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.539
Maybe you ought to look
into community college.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.141
Hold on, there.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.374
I ain't done yet.

15:52.718 --> 15:54.117
Wait.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.516
Ain't you that beautiful lady from before?

15:56.689 --> 15:59.089
Oh, yes, I am.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.657
Damn, baby.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.260
Look like somebody hit you
with an ugly stick.

16:08.767 --> 16:11.895
Sylvia, you can tell Mr. Wilmore
that I quit.

16:12.071 --> 16:15.063
Is that what you want me to tell
the news crew when they show up?

16:15.240 --> 16:16.264
You wouldn't.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.137
Try me.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.744
This isn't fair.

16:25.351 --> 16:28.582
Oh, please don't be mean to me.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.989
Well, I guess you don't have to be
any kind of actress to be a talk-show host.

16:34.393 --> 16:35.985
Great, a critic.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.254
I don't see
why you're making me clear dishes.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.988
You wanna wash?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.658
That's a good one.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.627
No, I was thinking of something
more along the line of hostessing.

16:47.806 --> 16:51.936
I could greet the people as they come in
with a smile and hand them their menus...

16:52.111 --> 16:54.807
...and take them to their seats.
- Clear.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.540
- I'll split my tips with you.
- Clear.

17:00.753 --> 17:01.913
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.179
Now, come on. Come on.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.845
Take it easy. Take it easy.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.925
Hey, hi. Let's go here
and let's lay you down on the couch...

17:08.093 --> 17:09.821
...so you can get comfortable.
- Okay.

17:09.994 --> 17:13.453
All right, we're gonna go down
on the count of three. You ready?

17:16.001 --> 17:18.333
I'm gonna go ahead
and let you take your own count.

17:19.838 --> 17:22.204
- Don't touch me.
- All right.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.441
Hey. How you doing?

17:28.614 --> 17:29.740
May I help you?

17:29.915 --> 17:31.974
Actually, it's for my uncle, you know?

17:32.151 --> 17:34.449
He needs a deep-tissue massage.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.020
As you can see,
the brother do got some deep tissue.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.714
You know what I'm saying? You know?

17:40.325 --> 17:41.883
What about you?

17:43.195 --> 17:45.789
Oh, no, no. I'm cool.
I'm all right, thanks.

17:45.964 --> 17:49.331
I'll give you the massage personally.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.765
Actually, I do got a kink right in here,
you know. Very tight.

17:55.874 --> 17:57.068
Is dinner ready yet?

17:57.242 --> 17:58.800
Not quite, honey. Almost.

17:58.977 --> 18:02.378
Well, can't you just hit me
with a little somethin'- somethin'?

18:03.048 --> 18:04.447
Not until dinner, honey.

18:04.616 --> 18:06.811
Aw, man.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.582
Yes.

18:11.623 --> 18:14.524
I make this stuffing for all my men.

18:14.693 --> 18:17.821
And they always come back for more.

18:18.130 --> 18:20.826
Yeah, because they forgot their shoes.

18:20.999 --> 18:23.593
You're just jealous, Vy.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.431
Jealous because I'm fine.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.038
Fine.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.300
Fine.

18:30.576 --> 18:33.511
Well, I've been told that I'm very sexy.

18:33.679 --> 18:36.147
Nine hundred numbers don't count.

18:36.548 --> 18:37.913
Geoffrey.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.380
What do you think?

18:39.551 --> 18:41.678
Who's more desirable?

18:41.854 --> 18:44.516
It's a tie. You both lose.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.892
Oh, Ashley, honey,
would you like to help?

18:49.061 --> 18:51.996
Help set women back a hundred years?
No, thank you.

18:52.164 --> 18:55.895
Oh, shut up, Ashley.

19:01.206 --> 19:02.434
Just my luck.

19:02.608 --> 19:06.100
There's some fire that's delayed the
news crew. They might not make it here.

19:06.278 --> 19:09.145
Oh, you just can't catch a break,
can you?

19:09.781 --> 19:11.544
You do understand.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.742
Oh, who asked you, anyway?

19:19.858 --> 19:23.385
Hey, uh, I didn't get you in trouble
with the old man, did I?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.888
Move it along, rat boy.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.327
And I didn't mean anything
by the short crack.

19:30.135 --> 19:32.831
Isn't there a vending machine
you should be kicking over...

19:33.005 --> 19:35.439
...or some other havoc
you should be wreaking?

19:36.275 --> 19:38.505
Oh, I see.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.874
Just because I'm in a place like this,
I should be committing crimes?

19:42.047 --> 19:45.107
What kind of a narrow-minded elitist
view of the world do you have?

19:45.284 --> 19:48.879
You come down here once a year,
give a guy a couple slices of turkey...

19:49.054 --> 19:51.852
...and all of a sudden
you think you're better than he is?

19:54.993 --> 19:57.052
I didn't mean anything by it.

19:58.630 --> 19:59.961
I had you going.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.563
You're a gullible little fellow, aren't you?

20:08.607 --> 20:11.303
Today is your lucky day.
You get a choice of body oils.

20:11.476 --> 20:15.936
We have cinnamon, honeysuckle
and our holiday special, cranberry.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.639
Do you have anything a little lower
in cholesterol?

20:20.452 --> 20:23.615
Baby, you could use Pennzoil, olive oil...

20:23.789 --> 20:27.520
...hell, you can even buff me up
with some Turtle Wax. I don't care.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.261
Just work it, girl.

20:32.431 --> 20:35.332
Oh, this is heavenly. Oh!

20:35.500 --> 20:38.992
Oh, that's definitely the right spot.

20:42.975 --> 20:47.776
Oh, that is definitely my spot.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.581
How you living over there, Uncle Phil?

20:54.753 --> 20:59.315
I believe the correct term is large.

20:59.491 --> 21:00.924
How about you?

21:01.326 --> 21:04.591
Oh, it is all good.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.163
Would you like the special?

21:07.332 --> 21:13.134
Baby, I will take the special with a side
of coleslaw and some extra biscuits.

21:14.306 --> 21:17.104
One special coming right up.

21:30.188 --> 21:33.487
Will, we're getting out of here.

21:33.659 --> 21:37.186
Uh, yeah, Uncle Phil.
You go ahead and warm the car up.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.829
I'll be out in about 10 minutes.

21:38.997 --> 21:41.158
Now!

21:42.701 --> 21:45.067
Call me. You call me.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.535
- I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
- No big deal.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.232
- Freeze.
Oh!

21:54.413 --> 21:56.643
Yeah, maybe this is a big deal,
Uncle Phil.
