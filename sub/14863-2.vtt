00:01.859 --> 00:03.343
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:03.368 --> 00:05.300
- Have you talked to him yet?
- Who?

00:05.325 --> 00:06.827
- Sexy smoldering.
- Who?

00:06.852 --> 00:08.131
I'm Daniel.

00:08.131 --> 00:09.856
Your work is beautiful.

00:10.616 --> 00:13.213
Does throwing parties
actually constitute a career?

00:13.213 --> 00:14.647
It does if you live in Los Angeles.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.849
You need a caterer.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.450
I'm arguably one of the
best chefs in this city.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.650
A woman tried to kill me,

00:18.685 --> 00:21.153
and a young man died from my mistakes.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.821
Hello, gorgeous.

00:23.795 --> 00:25.481
I think I'm ready to come back to work.

00:25.523 --> 00:26.856
Want to go meet your new roommate?

00:26.881 --> 00:28.382
Toni.

00:29.146 --> 00:30.963
Hello, Boss.

00:33.797 --> 00:34.797
Whoa.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.122
What?

00:36.157 --> 00:37.991
Just... wow!

00:38.025 --> 00:39.793
- This?
- Yeah.

00:39.827 --> 00:41.925
- Well...
- You going clubbing?

00:42.863 --> 00:44.864
Will you pass me my teasing comb, please?

00:44.899 --> 00:47.200
No. Why would you ask me
if I was going clubbing?

00:47.234 --> 00:49.868
Here's your teasing
comb, and, I don't know.

00:49.903 --> 00:51.946
It's my first day back
at work. I'm excited.

00:51.971 --> 00:53.024
Sure.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.200
"Sure"?

00:54.274 --> 00:56.034
She's got nothing on you.

00:56.758 --> 00:57.885
Who?

00:58.845 --> 01:01.560
- Toni.
- Toni who?

01:01.981 --> 01:04.283
Toni tan? Toni taut?

01:04.318 --> 01:06.314
Toni tumbling out of her v-neck?

01:06.391 --> 01:08.207
You are hotter.

01:09.672 --> 01:10.873
Excuse me.

01:11.291 --> 01:12.391
A-a-and smarter.

01:12.426 --> 01:13.426
I know.

01:13.460 --> 01:15.527
You know? Just by looking at her?

01:15.561 --> 01:17.829
No, I know just by looking at you.

01:17.863 --> 01:19.239
I know when you're lying.

01:19.264 --> 01:21.665
And you were lying about
the first one, mister.

01:21.934 --> 01:23.195
I love you.

01:23.421 --> 01:24.640
You better.

01:25.271 --> 01:27.772
Get your fix now, because
once we get into the office...

01:27.806 --> 01:29.437
Yeah. It's better no one knows about us.

01:29.462 --> 01:32.035
Yeah. I mean, I don't need anyone to know.

01:32.060 --> 01:34.422
The scrutiny, the judgment.
I'm partner less than a year.

01:34.447 --> 01:36.248
Yeah, right, you're
partner less than a year,

01:36.282 --> 01:38.283
and I certainly don't
need any more attention.

01:38.317 --> 01:40.017
I'm nervous enough going back to work

01:40.052 --> 01:41.919
with everyone wondering whether or not

01:41.954 --> 01:43.655
I lost brain function in the coma.

01:43.689 --> 01:45.189
Why would you think that?

01:45.224 --> 01:47.558
Because Mitchell asked me point-blank

01:47.592 --> 01:49.927
if I lost brain function in the coma.

01:49.962 --> 01:51.062
Yeah, okay.

01:51.096 --> 01:52.964
So, we keep it to ourselves.

01:52.998 --> 01:54.365
Yeah. Right. I mean,

01:54.399 --> 01:56.353
you know, as far as
anyone knows at the office,

01:56.378 --> 01:58.134
we're just co-workers and friends.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.331
- Right. Okay.
- Right.

01:59.356 --> 02:00.868
Well, technically, I'm your boss...

02:05.785 --> 02:09.210
- sync and corrections by Albanda -
- www.Addic7ed.com -

02:10.145 --> 02:11.949
You're going into business with Harry?

02:11.984 --> 02:14.618
It's not the flesh trade,
April. It's party planning.

02:14.653 --> 02:17.772
- Relax.
- I know, but how is that gonna work?

02:17.797 --> 02:18.797
I have no idea.

02:18.884 --> 02:20.652
Hence this very important meeting.

02:20.756 --> 02:22.291
You're meeting Harry here?

02:22.427 --> 02:24.295
W-w-where would you have me do it, April?

02:24.329 --> 02:25.996
Around the breakfast table with Dom?

02:26.631 --> 02:28.732
Wait. He and Savi sleep at the house?

02:28.767 --> 02:29.833
Sometimes, yes.

02:29.867 --> 02:31.468
How is that for you?

02:31.503 --> 02:33.103
"Second chance at life" sex it's...

02:33.137 --> 02:35.672
louder than normal-people sex.

02:35.706 --> 02:38.108
- You'll need a plate of scones.
- Yeah.

02:38.142 --> 02:40.922
You know, eventually,
I'm gonna get an office,

02:40.952 --> 02:43.753
or a kitchen... Or a koffice.

02:44.015 --> 02:45.148
I just want to make sure

02:45.183 --> 02:46.917
that Harry understands the way that I work.

02:46.951 --> 02:48.451
Hey, do you think that me being his boss

02:48.485 --> 02:49.820
is gonna make things weird between us?

02:51.222 --> 02:52.564
Who's Daniel?

02:52.621 --> 02:53.887
I don't kno...

02:54.991 --> 02:57.870
Daniel... The artist.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.262
Sexy smoldering?

03:00.287 --> 03:02.022
Did you sleep with... you slept with him?!

03:02.047 --> 03:03.781
Shh! Shh! Shh!

03:05.536 --> 03:07.037
Hello. April Malloy.

03:07.337 --> 03:09.305
Hello.

03:09.808 --> 03:10.940
I did?

03:10.974 --> 03:11.941
No.

03:11.975 --> 03:14.005
I hadn't
even noticed.

03:14.762 --> 03:15.929
Okay.

03:17.081 --> 03:18.579
Thanks for calling.

03:18.613 --> 03:20.051
Bye.

03:21.250 --> 03:22.283
What?

03:22.318 --> 03:24.284
I left my earring at his loft.

03:24.820 --> 03:26.263
You "left your earring" at his loft?

03:26.288 --> 03:28.489
No, I didn't "leave" my earring.

03:28.581 --> 03:29.876
I left my earring.

03:29.901 --> 03:32.369
It must've fallen out when we were...

03:32.794 --> 03:34.628
Ripping each other's clothes off.

03:34.663 --> 03:35.696
Kill me now.

03:35.731 --> 03:37.707
- Why?! This is amazing.
- I'm sorry,

03:37.732 --> 03:40.087
does it not seem like I
left my jewelry at his house

03:40.112 --> 03:41.513
in a childish ploy to see him again?

03:41.627 --> 03:43.661
Yeah. No, it totally does. 100%.

03:43.686 --> 03:44.704
My God.

03:44.983 --> 03:46.350
What? Obvi... April.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.209
Obviously, he wants to see
you, or he wouldn't have called.

03:48.543 --> 03:50.674
Well, what makes you
think I want to see him?

03:50.757 --> 03:51.957
It wasn't good.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.210
No. It was good.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.397
It was...

03:55.602 --> 03:56.832
Damn.

03:58.252 --> 04:00.487
But it... it just... it wasn't...

04:00.521 --> 04:01.619
Circumcised?

04:01.662 --> 04:03.596
No, it wasn't... Me.

04:03.858 --> 04:05.383
Okay, what does that even mean?

04:05.408 --> 04:09.277
An uninhibited free spirit
had sex with that hot bohemian,

04:09.383 --> 04:12.064
not this stress case who
sells ottomans and bath salts

04:12.099 --> 04:14.601
and single-handedly
raises an 11-year-old girl.

04:14.635 --> 04:16.368
An 11-year-old girl
who is at astrocamp

04:16.403 --> 04:17.397
for the next two days.

04:17.422 --> 04:19.623
I'm not doing it, Joss. Nope. Nope.

04:19.678 --> 04:23.923
As great as the night was, I
am horrified that it happened,

04:23.948 --> 04:25.778
and I have already moved on.

04:25.803 --> 04:28.997
But you can pick up the earring for me.

04:29.022 --> 04:31.053
- What?
- It's a half-carat diamond.

04:31.078 --> 04:32.831
- Please, Joss?
- Okay, I just...

04:32.856 --> 04:33.984
you need to breathe.

04:36.889 --> 04:38.223
Dude, You better be on your way,

04:38.257 --> 04:39.424
'cause you're 20 minutes late.

04:39.458 --> 04:40.691
I got us a gig.

04:40.726 --> 04:41.893
You got us a what?

04:41.928 --> 04:44.346
A party. A dinner.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.647
A gig.

04:45.739 --> 04:48.098
Okay. Let me pull up the calendar.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.945
- When is it?
- Tomorrow night, baby.

04:49.997 --> 04:52.098
Tomorrow night?!

04:52.196 --> 04:53.262
Is there a problem?

04:53.406 --> 04:55.005
W... Harry, I...

04:55.040 --> 04:56.474
The client's Janine Winterbaum.

04:56.508 --> 04:58.576
She'll be at the house
to meet us in 45 minutes.

04:58.610 --> 05:00.456
Dress cute. I'll see you there.

05:00.604 --> 05:01.771
D...

05:05.851 --> 05:08.419
Room 206 was supposed to be mine.

05:08.454 --> 05:10.231
I have a patient coming in!

05:10.365 --> 05:13.567
It says "cancer support" right here.

05:13.944 --> 05:17.079
I see what it says now, but
someone erased my writing.

05:17.104 --> 05:18.586
That's not possible.

05:19.597 --> 05:20.965
It's very possible.

05:20.999 --> 05:23.067
It's the whole concept of a whiteboard!

05:23.101 --> 05:24.935
Dr. Blakeley wants to see you.

05:24.970 --> 05:26.536
Okay.

05:28.506 --> 05:30.975
I think Mary hates me.

05:31.009 --> 05:32.109
Mary's a thief.

05:32.143 --> 05:34.064
Steal your room For the O.A. meeting today?

05:34.144 --> 05:35.576
Cancer support.

05:35.643 --> 05:37.710
Those whiny, hairless bastards.

05:37.735 --> 05:39.357
Kidding.

05:39.516 --> 05:40.807
Clearly.

05:40.985 --> 05:43.368
So, you need a space
for your session today?

05:43.701 --> 05:44.701
Yes.

05:44.726 --> 05:45.838
Well, use my office.

05:45.863 --> 05:47.964
Thank you, Irving. Thank you.

05:48.225 --> 05:50.159
Wait, wait. We're not done.

05:50.194 --> 05:53.055
I got a call from your lawyer this morning.

05:53.970 --> 05:55.365
What does she want?

05:55.878 --> 05:57.066
Sit down.

06:01.204 --> 06:04.306
It seems Elizabeth Grey is up for release

06:04.340 --> 06:06.174
from central state psych.

06:08.745 --> 06:12.021
And Natalie wanted you, my shrink,

06:12.482 --> 06:15.784
to break the news to me in
case I had feelings about it?

06:16.227 --> 06:17.638
Don't you?

06:17.721 --> 06:21.189
My feelings are irrelevant
to her parole, aren't they?

06:21.224 --> 06:22.357
Not necessarily.

06:22.392 --> 06:25.060
You can testify. You can write a statement.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.961
No, thank you.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.692
If you feel she's a continuing threat,

06:29.717 --> 06:31.818
it could have considerable sway.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.823
I have rounds to do and
a new patient to see.

06:33.848 --> 06:34.982
Can I go now?

06:35.104 --> 06:36.438
Of course.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:56.191 --> 06:57.859
Hi.

06:58.774 --> 06:59.874
Hi.

07:02.397 --> 07:04.766
This is embarrassing.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.034
Could I just have the...

07:06.068 --> 07:07.535
The earring back.

07:07.570 --> 07:08.816
Yeah.

07:12.195 --> 07:13.496
Here.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.079
Well, then.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.862
I know, cariño, but you can't have it all.

07:35.897 --> 07:37.330
You must give her the yacht

07:37.364 --> 07:38.981
unless you want to give up the condo.

07:39.233 --> 07:41.900
Still in love with the
wife. It's so heartbreaking.

07:42.146 --> 07:44.658
Phenomenal shoes. Where did you get them?

07:44.683 --> 07:45.650
A b...

07:45.675 --> 07:47.601
Okay. Esto es lo que vamos a hacer.

07:47.626 --> 07:49.257
Te vas a tomar una copita de vino,

07:49.257 --> 07:51.119
y después te vas a relajar. Okay?

07:51.144 --> 07:52.745
Bueno. Adiós.

07:52.779 --> 07:55.247
Good morning! Buenos días!

07:55.281 --> 07:57.583
"Savannah" or "Savi"...
what should I call you?

07:57.618 --> 07:59.118
- Savi's fine.
- How are you?

07:59.152 --> 08:01.697
Are you good? Is this
okay like this, the desks?

08:01.722 --> 08:03.723
I mean, We can turn mine around, but

08:03.748 --> 08:05.591
you'd be staring at my ass all day.

08:05.625 --> 08:07.292
We wouldn't want that.

08:07.327 --> 08:09.448
We should go to lunch and
get to know each other.

08:09.473 --> 08:10.841
I heard you almost died.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.559
See you for a minute?

08:13.762 --> 08:15.763
I... I meant Savi.

08:17.370 --> 08:18.803
Â¡Qué tonta yo!

08:18.838 --> 08:21.582
I got so used to that being
my signal all this time.

08:24.078 --> 08:25.987
How's the day going?

08:26.067 --> 08:27.234
Great.

08:27.259 --> 08:29.727
Yeah, that was... You
know the Breitling Hotels?

08:29.816 --> 08:31.784
I'm talking about the Vintage in New York,

08:31.809 --> 08:33.409
Le Petit Apartment in Paris.

08:33.434 --> 08:36.318
Anyway, luxury, boutique
hotels all over the world.

08:36.344 --> 08:38.148
Wait... Andre Breitling?

08:38.173 --> 08:39.787
Yeah, I just saw him on "Bill Maher."

08:39.833 --> 08:41.874
What makes him an expert in politics?

08:41.899 --> 08:44.377
Savi, he's coming in today.

08:44.413 --> 08:46.982
Now, you up to it? I mean, I
don't want to overwhelm you.

08:47.654 --> 08:49.976
Too late. You already do.

08:51.289 --> 08:52.690
All right, well, let's prep, then.

08:52.715 --> 08:54.415
- Okay.
- Your office?

08:54.440 --> 08:58.137
You know, let's... Let's
use your office, please.

08:58.137 --> 08:59.382
- All right.
- Okay.

09:13.852 --> 09:16.658
Well, Janine, you did have
your own table at Savannah's.

09:16.683 --> 09:18.251
Yes.

09:18.276 --> 09:19.643
Right by the kitchen,

09:19.668 --> 09:21.669
with a view of your gorgeous mug.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.160
Look at that face.

09:23.662 --> 09:26.256
You know what I was just
saying to Alan yesterday?

09:26.385 --> 09:28.539
Well, after Kincaid had his "mini stroke"

09:28.564 --> 09:29.978
and said he couldn't do the party.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.810
I said, "do you know what I miss?

09:31.835 --> 09:33.737
I miss tasting Harry."

09:33.884 --> 09:34.993
Aww.

09:35.046 --> 09:37.485
That's... that's always
nice to hear, isn't it?

09:37.510 --> 09:38.944
Is it, though?

09:38.969 --> 09:41.270
Let's just chat real quick about the event.

09:41.295 --> 09:44.696
So, it's a charity dinner for lupus.

09:44.772 --> 09:46.122
Locusts.

09:46.147 --> 09:49.383
Madagascar's still recovering
from that awful swarm.

09:49.408 --> 09:52.109
You know, it threatened
60% of their rice crop.

09:52.333 --> 09:53.534
I didn't know that.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.504
Speaking of which, I was thinking

09:55.562 --> 09:58.777
we should take rice off the
menu completely, Harry, and

09:59.214 --> 10:02.410
replace it with a more...
compassionate starch.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.703
Yeah, yeah, he... he
can, figure out the menu

10:04.728 --> 10:06.194
as soon as we choose a theme.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.407
But you've already decided the menu.

10:08.534 --> 10:09.534
He did?

10:09.873 --> 10:12.141
- This morning.
- Yeah. Yeah, he faxed it over.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.914
Do you just... care if
I take a gander at that?

10:16.246 --> 10:18.828
Sure. And I think what you
were saying is right, Harry.

10:18.899 --> 10:20.632
With your lamb as the main,

10:20.657 --> 10:22.458
we should run with the Moroccan vibe.

10:22.483 --> 10:24.670
Turn my home into "Arabian nights."

10:24.695 --> 10:26.782
Yes. Yes!

10:26.807 --> 10:28.474
You could have, mosaic tables,

10:28.499 --> 10:30.269
you could have a caidal tent if you want.

10:30.294 --> 10:32.695
Leather poufs instead of chairs.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.011
You know, just... it's... but 75 people.

10:35.036 --> 10:36.837
That's... that's... that's a lot of poufs.

10:36.862 --> 10:38.362
Money is no object.

10:38.387 --> 10:40.820
No, but just time kind of is.

10:42.169 --> 10:45.119
Pbht. Joss tends to
doubt herself sometimes.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.811
But she gets the job done in the end.

10:55.084 --> 10:56.951
Smells like heaven in here.

10:58.103 --> 11:00.270
You like spicy?

11:00.525 --> 11:01.825
I do.

11:03.840 --> 11:04.994
Okay.

11:05.362 --> 11:06.663
Bardolino.

11:06.698 --> 11:07.921
Thank you.

11:15.939 --> 11:18.774
- That's good.
- Come here.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.673
- Where?
- Here.

11:22.708 --> 11:24.697
Here?

11:32.070 --> 11:34.227
- I'm sorry.
- What?

11:34.252 --> 11:35.319
It's just...

11:35.510 --> 11:37.877
I mean, this is ridiculous.

11:37.935 --> 11:40.136
I don't even know you,
and you're feeding me.

11:40.161 --> 11:41.561
I think it's safe to say

11:41.586 --> 11:43.787
that that's the least of my offenses.

11:48.973 --> 11:52.092
Is there anything you want to talk about?

11:52.132 --> 11:54.349
No. I don't need to.

11:54.468 --> 11:56.566
- You?
- No. I'm cool. Are you cool?

11:56.591 --> 11:58.739
- I'm cool.
- No, 'cause if you want, I'm open.

11:58.891 --> 12:00.503
Just feed me.

12:01.449 --> 12:03.217
Yes, ma'am.

12:09.832 --> 12:12.533
The language-immersion program
in his international hotels

12:12.568 --> 12:14.869
should've been patented, like, years ago.

12:14.903 --> 12:17.762
I've also made a list of his legal issues.

12:17.809 --> 12:19.009
Let's not be negative.

12:19.043 --> 12:21.145
No, no. Not negative... just prepared.

12:21.179 --> 12:23.147
And these bullet points are my solutions.

12:24.315 --> 12:25.882
You so want to kiss me right now.

12:27.117 --> 12:29.889
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

12:29.962 --> 12:31.663
I loved it.

12:31.892 --> 12:33.427
But it wasn't as romantic

12:33.524 --> 12:35.958
as your hotel Cala d'Or in Majorca.

12:39.430 --> 12:41.665
Mr. Breitling. Dominic Taylor.

12:41.699 --> 12:42.899
Yes, Mr. Taylor.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.267
We spoke on the phone.

12:44.302 --> 12:47.674
I see you've met one of our
associates, Antonia Ruiz.

12:47.748 --> 12:50.005
Sorry... I was just passing by,

12:50.039 --> 12:52.546
and I could not resist introducing myself.

12:52.655 --> 12:55.355
Yes, apparently, I am
personally responsible

12:55.380 --> 12:58.315
for many of her best
international love affairs.

13:02.516 --> 13:03.927
Savi Davis.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.464
Pleasure to meet you.

13:07.688 --> 13:09.925
Well, I'll let you all get to it.

13:09.959 --> 13:11.582
Please.

13:11.689 --> 13:13.389
I have no secrets.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.011
Well...

13:18.500 --> 13:20.443
There are enough chairs at the table.

13:20.490 --> 13:21.505
Bravo.

13:42.664 --> 13:44.914
You pathetic, lonely bitch.

13:56.573 --> 13:59.161
Hi, Anna. It's Dr. Kim.

13:59.497 --> 14:01.464
We had an appointment at 4:00.

14:01.592 --> 14:02.892
It's 7 after.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.172
No big deal.

14:04.401 --> 14:08.304
Just thought I'd call to
remind you that it's office 209.

14:08.337 --> 14:09.663
Okay.

14:26.834 --> 14:28.001
Don't pick it up, Karen.

14:35.109 --> 14:36.342
Dr. Kim?

14:36.377 --> 14:37.675
Hi. Anna.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.463
Glad you could make it.
Please... come on in.

14:53.929 --> 14:55.956
April, honey, a little help here, please.

14:56.059 --> 14:57.959
Welcome to Maison sur Mer.

14:57.994 --> 14:59.128
Hi. Who are you?

14:59.523 --> 15:00.662
Brynn.

15:00.696 --> 15:02.564
Brynn, where's April?

15:02.698 --> 15:03.999
Not here.

15:04.034 --> 15:05.334
Okay.

15:05.368 --> 15:07.306
I am, April's good friend Joss.

15:07.331 --> 15:09.285
I just need to put a
bunch of stuff on memo...

15:09.310 --> 15:11.372
Everything Moroccan that you have.

15:11.397 --> 15:14.345
These linens, I will purchase, obviously.

15:14.439 --> 15:16.140
Carved-wood stools...

15:16.173 --> 15:18.713
Anything, mosaic works, as well.

15:18.748 --> 15:21.249
This lamp is perfect!

15:21.283 --> 15:23.018
But that's not for sale.

15:23.052 --> 15:25.420
Of course it's for sale.
Everything in here's for sale.

15:25.454 --> 15:28.120
But it doesn't matter. I'm not
buying it. I'm putting it on a memo.

15:28.145 --> 15:29.356
I don't know what that is.

15:29.770 --> 15:31.491
Okay.

15:33.581 --> 15:36.037
April, it's me. I'm at
your store. I need you.

15:36.064 --> 15:37.330
Okay, here. You know...
you know what? It's fine.

15:37.365 --> 15:39.299
Just... just put it all on
this card and then just void it

15:39.333 --> 15:40.604
when I come back, okay?

15:42.904 --> 15:44.104
My God!

15:44.138 --> 15:46.539
Where am I gonna find 100
votives at 7:00 at night?

15:46.574 --> 15:48.890
Go, Brynn! Go! The party's in 24 hours!

15:48.890 --> 15:50.202
I'm gonna call April.

15:50.227 --> 15:51.978
Good idea. Yes. Go.

15:52.574 --> 15:54.342
Okay.

15:54.685 --> 15:57.014
My God, she's stealing...

15:57.039 --> 15:58.340
Hey!

16:13.491 --> 16:14.892
Whoa. You don't have to do all that.

16:15.510 --> 16:17.214
Yeah.

16:17.355 --> 16:21.090
I also, bake cookies, sew
name tags, and cut meat.

16:21.329 --> 16:22.615
You got somewhere to be?

16:22.781 --> 16:26.115
Well, you said you were
feeling inspired to work,

16:26.140 --> 16:29.376
so I didn't want to... get in your way.

16:29.457 --> 16:31.526
I was hoping we could work together.

16:34.028 --> 16:35.826
Why don't you put down the sponge?

18:21.725 --> 18:22.858
I'm sorry.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.526
I'm sorry!

18:24.560 --> 18:25.861
Was I singing?

18:25.896 --> 18:26.962
I'm sorry.

18:26.997 --> 18:29.165
I don't know when I do it. It just happens.

18:30.533 --> 18:31.818
It's fine.

18:37.874 --> 18:39.741
Okay, you know what?

18:39.776 --> 18:42.544
Maybe we should... time-share the office.

18:42.578 --> 18:44.646
For instance, if you're off-site,

18:44.681 --> 18:47.850
taking a deposition or
something or at a lunch meeting,

18:47.884 --> 18:49.384
then I can use the office.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.960
Or if I'm at a meeting,
say... in the conference room,

18:53.000 --> 18:54.455
then you can use the office.

18:54.489 --> 18:56.124
You're mad about the meeting.

18:56.158 --> 18:57.292
No.

18:57.326 --> 19:00.359
I intruded on your meeting with Andre.

19:01.030 --> 19:03.131
I'm pushy. I'm sorry.

19:03.165 --> 19:04.765
It's fine. It's fine.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.535
He liked you, and the whole
objective was to woo the client.

19:07.569 --> 19:09.734
Aww. Well, he liked you, too.

19:09.812 --> 19:11.973
Let's just hope he chooses our firm.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.426
And your idea is a good one.

19:14.451 --> 19:16.588
No use for us To be on top of each other.

19:17.046 --> 19:18.713
Why don't you have the first shift?

19:18.747 --> 19:20.614
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

19:20.649 --> 19:23.218
It'll give me an excuse
to go hang out with Dom.

19:23.252 --> 19:25.091
Got to get me some of that.

19:29.991 --> 19:31.959
Anna Choi, 25.

19:31.993 --> 19:33.494
Severe chronic depression.

19:33.528 --> 19:34.862
Karen.

19:36.130 --> 19:37.732
Thank you for being here.

19:40.769 --> 19:43.571
She showed up to the
session 15 minutes late,

19:43.605 --> 19:46.091
citing reluctance to
come back to the hospital.

19:46.307 --> 19:49.309
Patient spent much time
fixated on this point.

19:49.344 --> 19:51.679
Maybe you could tell him
you were screwing his father.

19:51.713 --> 19:53.713
Stop.

19:53.748 --> 19:55.282
But you love her, Sam.

19:55.316 --> 19:56.816
But you love her, Sam, don't you?

19:56.851 --> 19:58.485
Just like your father did.

19:58.511 --> 20:01.978
Patient clearly experiencing fear...

20:02.112 --> 20:03.746
Avoidance...

20:04.894 --> 20:06.826
Not quite ready to face herself.

20:06.861 --> 20:08.295
I said don't turn around.

20:08.329 --> 20:09.629
Stop it!

20:10.428 --> 20:11.896
Get out!

20:12.239 --> 20:13.867
Get out of here!!

21:20.784 --> 21:22.672
That house belonged to my mother.

21:23.687 --> 21:24.987
It's stunning.

21:25.021 --> 21:26.395
East coast?

21:26.542 --> 21:27.685
Vermont.

21:28.559 --> 21:31.285
Yeah, she was a maid there for 34 years.

21:32.161 --> 21:34.758
Boss died, and he just left it to her.

21:34.783 --> 21:35.789
Wow.

21:35.814 --> 21:38.783
Well, he knew that nobody was gonna
take care of it the way she did.

21:39.202 --> 21:40.221
Yeah.

21:40.385 --> 21:42.917
She cared for it the way she cared for him.

21:45.308 --> 21:47.383
- Is your mom... ?
- She died.

21:47.551 --> 21:50.781
Six years ago this May.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.981
But this is the life she wanted for me.

21:56.152 --> 21:57.983
You know, surrounded by nature,

21:58.326 --> 22:01.280
summers to dream in, winters
that slap you in the face

22:01.312 --> 22:03.394
and make damn sure you wake up.

22:04.232 --> 22:06.057
You know, and plenty of space...

22:07.029 --> 22:09.095
to fill with generations of love.

22:16.571 --> 22:19.528
Okay, so, while I am powerpointing,

22:19.528 --> 22:22.174
you know, and... and citing
the latest legislation,

22:22.241 --> 22:25.121
she's flipping her hair
and giggling at the client,

22:25.146 --> 22:26.562
and her cleavage

22:26.639 --> 22:29.458
is like a whole other person in the room!

22:29.852 --> 22:33.099
And then she flat-out tells me

22:33.288 --> 22:35.756
that she wants to have sex.

22:36.099 --> 22:37.099
With Dom.

22:37.201 --> 22:38.436
- What?!
- Yeah.

22:38.461 --> 22:40.044
She told you this?!

22:40.262 --> 22:42.126
But she doesn't know you're together.

22:42.226 --> 22:43.659
No. I mean, no one does.

22:43.684 --> 22:45.719
But, still, the bitch is after my man.

22:45.786 --> 22:47.955
- Can't have that.
- Can't have that.

22:50.176 --> 22:51.743
How about you? How was work?

22:51.777 --> 22:53.545
How was your first session back?

22:54.636 --> 22:55.745
Fine.

22:55.770 --> 22:56.880
Weird.

22:56.915 --> 22:58.349
Patient spent most of the time

22:58.383 --> 23:01.135
talking about how she hated
being back at the hospital.

23:02.154 --> 23:05.456
Plus, I was very distracted.

23:05.899 --> 23:08.359
Can't imagine why that would be.

23:08.393 --> 23:09.860
Maybe it has something to do with

23:09.894 --> 23:11.829
Elizabeth being up for release?

23:12.083 --> 23:14.465
- How did you...
- We're her lawyers, remember?

23:14.499 --> 23:15.522
Right.

23:16.335 --> 23:17.835
Of course. Right.

23:18.370 --> 23:19.837
You gonna give a statement?

23:19.871 --> 23:20.971
No.

23:21.005 --> 23:22.005
No?

23:22.039 --> 23:23.873
She's psychotic. She tried to kill me.

23:23.907 --> 23:26.443
She killed her own son.
They're not gonna let her out.

23:26.477 --> 23:29.212
I am really sorry to be
the one to say this to you,

23:29.246 --> 23:31.367
but I feel like if you don't show up,

23:31.473 --> 23:33.341
it's a vote for her release.

23:35.552 --> 23:36.586
I'm sorry.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.875
I mean, I don't mean
to sound insensitive.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.321
Sweetheart.

23:43.727 --> 23:45.475
You're still scared.

23:47.430 --> 23:49.375
I thought I was over it.

23:49.899 --> 23:51.775
I felt healthy.

23:51.901 --> 23:54.475
I mean, at the beginning, I was a wreck.

23:55.205 --> 23:57.775
Went to Sam's grave every day.

23:58.975 --> 24:00.775
Then twice a week.

24:01.211 --> 24:02.575
Then once a week.

24:04.147 --> 24:06.375
I sought out therapy for myself.

24:07.117 --> 24:09.985
Of course, it quickly became clear

24:10.019 --> 24:11.591
that it wasn't just about that day.

24:12.974 --> 24:15.578
It was about that monstrous woman

24:16.492 --> 24:19.178
and how she tortured me for a year.

24:20.353 --> 24:22.430
I was starting back to my practice,

24:22.464 --> 24:24.651
and just the mention of her name today...

24:26.135 --> 24:28.537
And I'm right back where I started.

24:30.673 --> 24:32.496
She haunts me, Savi.

24:34.510 --> 24:36.351
And I think she always will.

24:38.119 --> 24:40.259
And that's exactly why you have to do this.

24:42.150 --> 24:44.351
Whatever it takes to keep her locked up.

24:49.490 --> 24:50.658
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:50.692 --> 24:52.726
The ice mint tea's for cocktails.

24:52.761 --> 24:54.762
The samovar goes out later, okay?

24:54.796 --> 24:55.930
I told you.

24:55.964 --> 24:58.598
Dave, Dave, you're
peeling it too thick, mate.

24:58.632 --> 25:00.995
Okay? The zucchini needs
to ribbon, yeah? A ribbon.

25:01.031 --> 25:03.540
Okay. Well, the camel guy
showed up, so that's a relief.

25:03.604 --> 25:05.672
What would I have done with
this fork-horned saddle?

25:05.706 --> 25:07.040
You're late.

25:07.675 --> 25:08.675
Did you get the votives?

25:08.709 --> 25:10.277
No, I did not.

25:10.311 --> 25:11.445
Why not?

25:12.007 --> 25:13.113
Seriously?

25:13.147 --> 25:14.518
Harry, I got a camel...

25:14.543 --> 25:16.986
A real, live, leaf-eating,
cud-chewing camel.

25:17.011 --> 25:18.632
I did
lanterns instead.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.986
They're... they're glass,
they're gorgeous. Let's move on.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.072
Well, you c...

25:22.097 --> 25:23.889
Well, hey, hey. Don't
leave this stuff here.

25:23.923 --> 25:24.923
Wait... Joss!

25:24.958 --> 25:26.007
What?!

25:26.826 --> 25:28.994
It didn't look like there
were enough poufs out there.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.097
I mixed them with carved stools.

25:31.131 --> 25:34.100
She told you specifically she wanted poufs.

25:34.134 --> 25:35.567
She also said that she wanted hookers

25:35.601 --> 25:36.834
when she really meant hookahs.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.703
Harry, it took me 6 1/2
hours to figure that out.

25:38.737 --> 25:40.605
Well, she's not gonna
be happy, Joss, so get...

25:40.639 --> 25:42.974
Hello! How's it going in here? Hi!

25:43.008 --> 25:44.709
Hey, perfect.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.643
You look fantastic. Fabulous caftan.

25:46.668 --> 25:49.034
It's Mrs. Roper off her meds.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.048
- Looks terrible.
- I love it.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.717
Whatever. Anyway, can I have a taste?

25:52.751 --> 25:56.218
Yeah. This is harira.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.658
It's exquisite.

26:01.692 --> 26:03.660
You're exquisite.

26:04.895 --> 26:07.264
- Thank you both.
- My pleasure.

26:07.298 --> 26:08.798
Our pleasure.

26:13.532 --> 26:16.157
You, hungry, thirsty?

26:16.529 --> 26:18.540
I don't need a thing.

26:20.010 --> 26:21.540
You're dressed again.

26:22.879 --> 26:24.147
I am.

26:24.181 --> 26:25.440
You're leaving.

26:26.783 --> 26:28.083
I have to.

26:28.118 --> 26:29.185
No!

26:29.219 --> 26:30.886
No, you don't.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.389
No, I...

26:35.459 --> 26:36.691
I do.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.040
Stay.

26:39.428 --> 26:41.029
I have to pick up my daughter.

26:41.063 --> 26:43.198
She gets home from her school trip tonight.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.501
Okay.

26:49.030 --> 26:50.806
I should probably get some sleep anyway.

26:50.864 --> 26:52.564
I'm flying to Vermont tomorrow.

26:54.710 --> 26:56.278
For how long?

26:56.312 --> 26:57.579
Probably a week.

26:57.613 --> 27:00.215
Possibly a little bit more.

27:00.249 --> 27:02.150
I usually play it by ear.

27:05.020 --> 27:07.088
Well, have a safe trip.

27:16.793 --> 27:17.913
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:17.968 --> 27:19.366
Congratulations.

27:19.401 --> 27:21.235
We got the Breitling account.

27:21.269 --> 27:22.403
We did?

27:22.437 --> 27:24.438
That's awesome.

27:24.472 --> 27:25.539
We're a good team?

27:26.919 --> 27:29.810
But, he, he wants Toni, too.

27:29.844 --> 27:31.644
Which, considering
the size of the account

27:31.679 --> 27:33.379
and the fact that you're only part-time,

27:33.414 --> 27:34.715
may be a good thing.

27:37.362 --> 27:39.516
What if I can't work with Toni?

27:40.541 --> 27:42.589
Okay.

27:44.354 --> 27:45.726
Want to tell me why?

27:45.760 --> 27:48.361
For starters, the constant flirting...

27:48.395 --> 27:50.430
with the clients, the partners.

27:50.464 --> 27:51.631
I mean, it's embarrassing.

27:51.665 --> 27:54.234
Gloria Steinem would
roll over in her grave.

27:54.268 --> 27:55.435
I don't think she's dead.

27:55.469 --> 27:57.002
Is that really the point, Dom?

27:57.037 --> 27:58.504
Why are you so upset?

27:58.539 --> 28:00.673
Why aren't you more upset?

28:00.708 --> 28:03.509
I mean, she made a total fool
of you in front of Breitling,

28:03.544 --> 28:06.446
- undermined your authority...
- Made a fool of me? Really?

28:06.480 --> 28:08.681
- No, I just...
- I mean, I didn't want her to stay,

28:08.716 --> 28:10.349
but I just didn't want
to seem partial to you.

28:10.383 --> 28:12.351
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

28:12.385 --> 28:14.620
I just... Look.

28:15.889 --> 28:17.744
She told me...

28:18.591 --> 28:21.093
That she wants to sleep with you.

28:24.744 --> 28:25.931
Why is that funny?

28:26.837 --> 28:28.037
I don't know.

28:28.071 --> 28:29.313
That... that it's meaningless.

28:29.338 --> 28:30.571
How is that meaningless?

28:30.598 --> 28:32.833
Because it's never gonna come to anything.

28:32.867 --> 28:35.169
Because, "A," I don't want it to,

28:35.203 --> 28:36.736
and, "B," I'm with you.

28:37.235 --> 28:39.405
I was actually with someone... taken...

28:39.439 --> 28:40.973
when we got together, Dom.

28:41.008 --> 28:42.308
Savannah, come on.

28:42.342 --> 28:44.243
No. I was married to Harry.

28:44.278 --> 28:47.579
I loved him, and I swore
that I would never betray him.

28:47.614 --> 28:49.659
But you know what? I did.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.712
Eventually, I did.

28:52.386 --> 28:54.635
Okay? So it is possible.

28:54.660 --> 28:57.028
If this is gonna work, you
are gonna have to trust me.

28:57.191 --> 28:59.425
- Can you do that?
- I don't know.

28:59.459 --> 29:01.393
You don't know?

29:01.428 --> 29:03.930
- Do you trust me?
- Of course I do!

29:03.964 --> 29:05.531
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

29:06.511 --> 29:07.434
Okay.

29:07.459 --> 29:09.113
Okay, this is...

29:09.617 --> 29:11.417
This is... Crazy.

29:11.442 --> 29:12.604
This is...

29:13.206 --> 29:15.841
Okay, the more blasé you are about this,

29:15.875 --> 29:17.676
the more worried I'm getting.

29:17.711 --> 29:18.844
Can't you see that?

29:18.878 --> 29:20.612
I just don't know what you're doing.

29:20.647 --> 29:22.956
I'm being aware, Dom.

29:23.450 --> 29:25.956
Of myself, of us,

29:26.977 --> 29:29.020
of who we are and how we got here.

29:29.055 --> 29:30.656
I mean, look, you and I,

29:30.690 --> 29:33.591
we're both capable Of
incredible deceit, okay?

29:33.625 --> 29:36.728
And for you to pretend
like that's not true,

29:36.762 --> 29:38.676
it means you're not watching yourself.

29:39.732 --> 29:41.676
Which means that I have to.

29:45.104 --> 29:47.376
And I j... I don't want to.

30:11.725 --> 30:13.503
Gris de Guerrouane?

30:14.973 --> 30:16.106
No, thanks.

30:19.238 --> 30:23.474
To a man, Harry, your
cuisine was delicious.

30:24.642 --> 30:26.243
- Happy you were happy.
- Yes.

30:27.612 --> 30:30.114
But, Joss, let me start by saying

30:30.148 --> 30:32.516
that normally, when I ask
for something, I get it.

30:32.550 --> 30:34.384
And yesterday, when I asked for poufs,

30:34.419 --> 30:36.086
that's what I expected.

30:37.655 --> 30:40.557
But in this case, the carved stools

30:40.592 --> 30:43.059
worked out so much better.

30:43.094 --> 30:45.328
I mean, I had guests over 60

30:45.362 --> 30:47.563
that needed support for their
ass, and you gave it to them.

30:47.598 --> 30:48.564
Yeah.

30:48.599 --> 30:51.400
Plus, it was so cool and eclectic and...

30:51.612 --> 30:53.670
I don't know... just the
best party I've ever had.

30:53.704 --> 30:56.106
My gosh! Wow!

30:56.140 --> 30:58.141
- Thank you so much, Janine.
- Yes.

30:58.175 --> 30:59.909
I will e-mail both of you tomorrow

30:59.944 --> 31:02.278
with a testimonial for your website.

31:02.663 --> 31:05.848
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I am pooped and drunk.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.910
Good night, kiddos. Mwah!

31:08.935 --> 31:10.316
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:12.221 --> 31:14.712
Yes! Joss, we did it.

31:15.759 --> 31:17.326
The client was happy.
That party was awesome.

31:17.361 --> 31:18.794
This will definitely lead to more events.

31:18.828 --> 31:19.828
Yeah, listen, Harry,

31:19.863 --> 31:21.864
I'm thrilled that Janine was so pleased,

31:21.898 --> 31:24.066
and, frankly, I have never
been more proud of myself,

31:24.100 --> 31:26.302
but there is not a chance in hot hell

31:26.336 --> 31:28.203
that I will ever work with you again.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.394
My name's Karen Kim.

31:34.845 --> 31:36.745
I'm here to see the review board.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.547
If you feel threatened at any time

31:38.581 --> 31:40.615
anywhere on the floor, press this button.

31:41.343 --> 31:42.374
Thank you.

32:35.970 --> 32:37.205
Karen.

32:43.365 --> 32:44.565
You came.

32:56.590 --> 32:58.191
I'm up for review.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.265
I know.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.365
It's not so terrible in here.

33:06.499 --> 33:07.965
I like this room.

33:09.765 --> 33:11.865
There's a view of a sycamore tree.

33:13.073 --> 33:14.565
See there?

33:25.819 --> 33:27.352
How are you?

33:29.605 --> 33:30.865
Sober.

33:32.024 --> 33:33.265
Finally.

33:34.394 --> 33:36.405
Remarkably.

33:44.304 --> 33:45.970
I'm so sorry, Karen.

33:48.714 --> 33:50.625
I was hoping you'd come...

33:52.412 --> 33:54.313
So I could say that.

33:56.905 --> 33:58.705
Say that I'm sorry.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.405
I'm fine.

34:04.723 --> 34:06.505
I killed my son.

34:12.197 --> 34:14.331
How could I do that?

34:16.335 --> 34:18.105
How could I live with that?

34:22.341 --> 34:24.007
That's my punishment.

34:26.777 --> 34:28.304
This.

34:31.483 --> 34:36.405
I asked them for a day out
so... I could see his grave.

34:39.558 --> 34:40.956
They said no.

34:43.205 --> 34:45.228
I just want to see his grave.

34:49.243 --> 34:50.705
It's beautiful.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.201
You've seen it?

34:56.771 --> 34:58.205
Many times.

35:02.836 --> 35:04.837
There are always flowers.

35:22.078 --> 35:24.836
Nothing like a New York bagel.

35:25.467 --> 35:26.801
Burbank.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.002
No!

35:28.037 --> 35:30.104
Wait... so you just left?

35:30.139 --> 35:31.239
Yep.

35:31.273 --> 35:32.873
What do you mean "yep"?

35:32.908 --> 35:35.043
I am no longer afraid of Elizabeth Grey.

35:35.998 --> 35:38.166
I was sad for her, actually.

35:38.780 --> 35:40.866
And the board rejected her release.

35:41.050 --> 35:43.183
Bury the lead, why don't you?

35:43.217 --> 35:44.185
Good morning.

35:44.231 --> 35:46.265
You! Where have you been, woman?

35:46.387 --> 35:48.221
I left you like 20 messages.

35:48.256 --> 35:50.157
I know. I'm so sorry, honey.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.125
I was M.I.A.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.216
I was...

35:55.229 --> 35:56.964
I picked up the earring.

35:56.998 --> 35:58.731
What?!

35:58.766 --> 36:00.133
What's the earring?

36:00.168 --> 36:03.270
- What are you guys talking about?
- The hot, sculpture, artist guy.

36:04.313 --> 36:07.490
I was at his place for, like, 48 hours...

36:07.541 --> 36:10.609
The most incredible two days of my life.

36:10.643 --> 36:12.445
You slept with sexy smoldering?

36:12.479 --> 36:14.313
You're lagging. Catch up. Come on.

36:14.348 --> 36:17.216
- So what's next?
- Nothing.

36:18.123 --> 36:19.718
Nothing. He's never calling again.

36:19.752 --> 36:21.988
- Would you stop it? Yes, he will.
- What?

36:22.022 --> 36:24.556
No, I'm telling you, he's not.

36:24.591 --> 36:27.159
Everything changed as soon as I
mentioned Lucy was coming home.

36:27.194 --> 36:28.294
I read it on his face.

36:28.328 --> 36:30.662
You know, you misread faces all the time.

36:30.697 --> 36:34.300
Yeah, well, he also said he was
going out of town for a week.

36:34.334 --> 36:35.667
Yeah, he's never calling again.

36:35.702 --> 36:37.668
- That's the pre-dump.
- Nice friends.

36:37.703 --> 36:38.803
It's okay. It's okay.

36:38.837 --> 36:41.639
I am... I am at peace with it.

36:41.673 --> 36:43.475
I am grateful that it happened,

36:43.509 --> 36:47.445
and I am fine with it not happening again,

36:47.480 --> 36:48.946
never feeling that way again,

36:48.981 --> 36:51.582
The best I ever felt about myself

36:51.617 --> 36:52.805
with another person.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.819
Sweetie.

36:55.988 --> 36:56.988
Sweetie.

36:59.125 --> 37:01.516
Sorry.

37:01.670 --> 37:03.955
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, Harry.

37:04.073 --> 37:05.362
It's okay.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.498
You... you don't have to go.

37:07.532 --> 37:09.366
No, we'll go.

37:09.401 --> 37:10.485
I'm going.

37:11.269 --> 37:12.836
So good to see you, though.

37:12.870 --> 37:14.505
It's good to see you. You look great.

37:14.539 --> 37:15.639
She's in love.

37:19.101 --> 37:21.311
So, you meeting the broker here?

37:21.346 --> 37:22.812
I thought everything was settled.

37:22.847 --> 37:24.047
No.

37:24.081 --> 37:25.515
I'm here to talk to Joss.

37:28.690 --> 37:30.005
What do you want, Harry?

37:31.053 --> 37:33.220
I've come to say I'm sorry.

37:34.358 --> 37:35.978
For questioning the stools.

37:36.930 --> 37:38.061
The stools?

37:38.095 --> 37:41.031
What about hijacking the
entire meeting with Janine

37:41.065 --> 37:44.343
and speaking for me and
being condescending to me

37:44.368 --> 37:46.374
and texting me all freakin' day

37:46.436 --> 37:48.070
and then yelling at me all night?

37:48.104 --> 37:49.337
You're a yeller.

37:49.372 --> 37:50.873
Well, yeah. Only in the kitchen.

37:50.907 --> 37:52.875
Okay, well, we would be
working together in a kitchen,

37:52.909 --> 37:55.044
so that makes a little bit
of a problem, doesn't it?

37:55.565 --> 37:56.776
Yeah. You're right.

37:57.948 --> 37:59.214
Sorry.

37:59.836 --> 38:02.184
I was... controlling.

38:02.218 --> 38:04.152
You were a bully.

38:04.187 --> 38:06.388
I get that way when I feel cornered.

38:06.422 --> 38:08.356
Cornered? Who was cornering you?

38:10.135 --> 38:11.976
Life...

38:12.874 --> 38:14.476
Circumstances?

38:15.698 --> 38:16.798
I don't know.

38:16.832 --> 38:18.766
Look, the past eight
months have been rough.

38:18.801 --> 38:20.569
You know, I just... I've lost a lot...

38:20.603 --> 38:23.171
Savi, the restaurant... Soon, the house.

38:23.206 --> 38:25.939
I just... I really needed
this to work, you know?

38:26.473 --> 38:28.407
I'm sorry, Joss.

38:28.432 --> 38:30.911
I couldn't see myself
leaving anything to chance.

38:30.945 --> 38:32.246
Well, I'm not chance, Harry.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.414
No, I know you're not.

38:33.448 --> 38:34.748
I'm really good at my job.

38:34.782 --> 38:35.916
You're great.

38:35.950 --> 38:38.051
I got to say, you really surprised me.

38:38.475 --> 38:40.154
What are you...

38:40.188 --> 38:42.789
I'm not a kid anymore.

38:42.824 --> 38:44.524
You know, Harry, the past eight months

38:44.558 --> 38:46.025
have really sucked for me, too.

38:46.059 --> 38:48.060
I've had to take care of
everything around here.

38:48.095 --> 38:49.895
I know... on your own.

38:49.930 --> 38:50.963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:50.998 --> 38:52.530
You did really good.

38:57.556 --> 38:59.972
I mean, you got to admit it,
though... we rocked that party.

39:00.007 --> 39:01.407
We rocked it.

39:01.442 --> 39:03.408
I mean, that was our very first gig,

39:03.443 --> 39:05.977
and we kicked its Arabian ass.

39:06.012 --> 39:08.213
Our instincts were good. It was great.

39:08.248 --> 39:10.501
We just got to, you
know, iron out the kinks.

39:11.964 --> 39:14.019
- You will never be my boss.
- Absolutely.

39:14.053 --> 39:15.820
- Ever.
- Ever.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.523
I bring clients, you bring clients,

39:17.557 --> 39:19.245
I cook, you plan... done.

39:19.492 --> 39:20.892
Okay.

39:20.926 --> 39:23.223
So... like partners?

39:23.248 --> 39:25.382
Yeah. If... if you'll have me.

39:27.932 --> 39:32.154
So, a designer comes in
and wants to borrow a piece.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.138
You fill out this form.

39:34.173 --> 39:35.288
Okay?

39:35.840 --> 39:37.908
Run the credit card for 20% of the price

39:37.942 --> 39:40.178
and refund the money
when they bring it back.

39:40.212 --> 39:42.079
Will that blond girl be coming in again?

39:42.113 --> 39:43.380
Often.

39:43.414 --> 39:44.758
She's a yeller.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.630
I've got inventory to do.

39:48.819 --> 39:50.587
Hey, I forgot to tell you...

39:50.621 --> 39:52.689
something came in this
morning I wasn't expecting.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.123
It wasn't on the receiving list.

39:54.158 --> 39:55.592
What?

39:55.626 --> 39:57.360
This big, weird thing.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.028
I put it in the back.

40:51.746 --> 40:52.912
Hi, Anna.

40:52.947 --> 40:53.947
Hi.

40:53.981 --> 40:55.282
Come on in.

40:57.629 --> 40:59.310
This place is great.

41:00.655 --> 41:02.122
Better, right?

41:03.358 --> 41:05.010
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

41:05.926 --> 41:07.719
Why don't you call me "Karen"?

41:16.630 --> 41:17.723
Hi.

41:17.937 --> 41:19.138
Hi.

41:21.207 --> 41:23.242
Are we in a fight?

41:23.277 --> 41:24.410
Don't ask me.

41:24.444 --> 41:28.013
I mean, I tend to be
blasé about these things.

41:34.988 --> 41:36.555
- I'm sorry.
- No.

41:36.590 --> 41:38.223
No. Don't be. Don't be.

41:38.258 --> 41:39.877
You were... you were right.

41:40.593 --> 41:43.127
I don't... see the whole picture enough.

41:44.730 --> 41:45.910
Look, you...

41:47.667 --> 41:51.235
You feel so right to me, Savannah.

41:51.270 --> 41:53.405
I mean, being with you
now feels so right to me

41:53.439 --> 41:55.707
that I don't think about how we started.

41:57.310 --> 41:59.444
You know what would be great?

41:59.478 --> 42:00.610
What?

42:01.313 --> 42:03.247
If we focused on something else.

42:04.187 --> 42:06.984
Like how... we chose each other,

42:07.492 --> 42:10.387
even when it wasn't
the easiest thing to do.

42:13.142 --> 42:14.476
And...

42:16.761 --> 42:18.229
I can work with Toni.

42:18.719 --> 42:20.865
- You don't have to.
- No.

42:20.899 --> 42:24.169
- I can find a way to work on it.
- It's okay. It's okay.

42:24.502 --> 42:25.970
You sure about that?

42:26.004 --> 42:27.081
Yeah.

42:27.676 --> 42:30.250
As long as we have this to ourselves...

42:30.642 --> 42:32.050
I can do that.

42:33.250 --> 42:34.712
Yeah.
