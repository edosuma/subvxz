WEBVTT

00:13.013 --> 00:14.306
No exit.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.807
Chest needle.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.726
Right now, goddamn it.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.063
What the hell are you doing?

00:22.940 --> 00:25.526
His lung collapsed.
I'm relieving the pressure.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.945
We bought him some time.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.738
Get him to med bay
and cut this goddamn suit off him

00:29.821 --> 00:30.989
so I can see what I'm dealing with.

00:31.073 --> 00:33.534
-Did we lose anybody?
-Negative, Commander.

00:33.617 --> 00:37.120
Commander Rossi? Houston's on the horn.
They're plenty riled.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.164
Yeah, so am I. On me.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.166
The other Russian?

00:41.250 --> 00:43.919
Didn't make it.
Jason's bringing his remains in now.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.129
Lopez and Bernitz
are still out at the site.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.840
What the hell happened out there?

00:47.923 --> 00:49.258
We were giving them the warning

00:49.341 --> 00:51.552
when they went for a crate
that could have had weapons in it.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.136
So we took them under fire.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.347
What do you mean,
"could have had weapons"?

00:55.430 --> 00:56.723
Did they grab guns or not?

00:56.807 --> 00:58.100
It happened fast.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.143
We perceived a hostile intent,
and we reacted.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.937
They didn't have weapons, sir.

01:02.020 --> 01:05.274
Turns out one of them was going for
their translation card when I...

01:05.858 --> 01:06.984
when I shot him.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.987
Colonel Paulson, Major Webster,

01:10.070 --> 01:12.906
are you sure there were no
Russian weapons on-site?

01:12.990 --> 01:16.326
Before I take this to the president,
I need to know just how bad it is.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.579
We're sure, ma'am.

01:19.288 --> 01:20.622
I see.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.583
And the cosmonaut, will he survive?

01:23.125 --> 01:24.585
We don't know.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.921
Okay. Keep us informed.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.381
Will do.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.633
Houston out.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.220
This isn't good.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.556
Wars have started over a lot less.

01:38.223 --> 01:42.352
World War I started with a gunshot
and killed 20 million people.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.771
Well, if this turns into World War III,

01:44.855 --> 01:47.482
20 million is gonna seem
like a car accident.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.088
You good, Trace?

03:34.673 --> 03:36.091
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:36.842 --> 03:37.885
Just...

03:51.565 --> 03:53.192
How do you make it stop?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.777
Just give it time.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.548
The first violent acts on the moon

04:16.632 --> 04:19.426
have been perpetrated
by the United States of America.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.097
US Marines,
armed with automatic weapons...

04:25.682 --> 04:27.768
took one of our mining sites by force

04:27.851 --> 04:31.063
and shot two of our cosmonauts
in cold blood.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.817
But the Soviet Union
will not be intimidated.

04:37.694 --> 04:41.532
We have reliable intelligence
that the next American Sea Dragon rocket

04:41.615 --> 04:44.576
plans to deliver nuclear weapons
to the moon.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.246
We will not allow this.

04:47.829 --> 04:52.000
If it attempts to do so,
it will be destroyed.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.838
Just how the hell
do they intend to do that?

04:55.921 --> 04:57.714
Shoot Sea Dragon down during the launch?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.967
I don't think they have the ability
to pull that off.

05:00.551 --> 05:01.927
If they break our COMSEC,

05:02.010 --> 05:05.055
they could veer it off course,
sending it crashing into the ocean.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.641
Sir.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.815
A recon satellite just detected a launch
from Sakhalin Island.

05:14.898 --> 05:15.941
A missile?

05:16.483 --> 05:18.861
No. It's their shuttle, Buran.

05:18.944 --> 05:22.197
Guess the Soviets either fixed the problem
or waited for warmer weather.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.117
CIA says it's armed.

05:26.577 --> 05:27.619
Armed?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.288
To the teeth.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.667
If Buran's overhead,
they could bomb Sea Dragon 17 from orbit,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.085
and we'd never see it coming.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.045
And that's not all they can hit.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.260
Let's go. They're tracking it at DODCOM.

05:56.064 --> 06:00.027
Three hours and all Buran's done
is dock with their space station.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.238
Maybe we're overreacting.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.116
It's their first shuttle flight.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.785
It could have nothing to do
with Sea Dragon.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.915
Buran could just be running
a docking test, like we do with Skylab.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.583
I'd like to believe that.

06:14.666 --> 06:18.045
But air force intel says they've been
stockpiling fuel on that station.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.130
And you didn't tell me?

06:20.214 --> 06:21.965
Not relevant to NASA operations.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.843
Our shuttles need to refuel
before they burn for the moon,

06:24.927 --> 06:27.346
-so they're maybe not testing anything.
-General--

06:27.429 --> 06:29.348
Buran's separated from Mir.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.684
They're picking up substantial delta-V
in the TLI window.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.019
They're headed for the moon.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.898
Buran could shoot down
Sea Dragon before it enters lunar orbit.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.775
Jesus.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.111
The Russians are blockading the moon.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.996
Come in.

06:55.082 --> 06:59.253
Well, well, well, look who's got
a new pair of spectacles.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.004
Told you it would happen to you too.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.714
Sit your ass down.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.592
Just one of the many wonderful experiences

07:05.676 --> 07:08.011
you're gonna enjoy in your golden years.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.807
Hair loss, kidney stones, colostomy bags.

07:11.890 --> 07:12.891
You done, Ed?

07:18.730 --> 07:20.899
What do you want to talk to me about?

07:20.983 --> 07:23.277
DOD is taking over your mission.

07:23.861 --> 07:27.489
Apparently the Soviets have sent
Buran to the moon to stop Sea Dragon.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.783
I can't believe
they're trying to pull this shit.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.246
Do they really think
we're sending nukes up there?

07:34.329 --> 07:38.250
This entire blockade is just an excuse
to cut off our people on the moon.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.710
And we can't let that happen.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.297
What else can you tell me?

07:43.380 --> 07:46.300
Not much.
DOD has locked this one down pretty tight.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.678
What I do know is that they've moved your
launch date up to the day after tomorrow.

07:49.761 --> 07:50.762
Holy shit.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.892
General Bradford will brief you
on the details.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.560
-Okay.
-Godspeed, Ed.

07:58.896 --> 07:59.938
Be safe up there.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.905
We're taking Pathfinder to the moon?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.781
That's the word from up on high.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.200
We're going up against Buran.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.910
Hell of a test flight.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.245
Look, our nuclear engines are solid,

08:15.329 --> 08:17.414
but there are still plenty of things
that can go wrong.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.208
I know, it's risky.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.251
But we need to make
the Russians think twice

08:21.335 --> 08:23.504
about stopping Sea Dragon 17
from reaching the moon.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.297
Pathfinder is the only ship
that can do it.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.548
So we're riding shotgun.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.009
Exactly.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.220
We'll rendezvous with Sea Dragon
in Earth's orbit

08:31.303 --> 08:32.763
and then escort her to Jamestown.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.431
And if the Russians don't back down?

08:34.515 --> 08:36.808
Then we will intercede.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.559
Intercede. Right.

08:38.644 --> 08:43.023
With radar-guided missiles, each carrying
over a hundred pounds of high explosives.

08:43.106 --> 08:46.193
Pretty convincing intercession.
And our missiles have a longer range.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.111
No. Okay, so, just to clarify,

08:48.195 --> 08:51.698
is the plan for us to shoot down Buran
before they fire at Sea Dragon?

08:52.241 --> 08:54.034
If anyone fires, we've failed.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.870
Our job is to discourage them
from doing so.

08:56.954 --> 09:00.958
So we're playing a game of chicken
with missiles.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.835
It's like LBJ said,

09:02.918 --> 09:06.171
whoever controls the high ground of space
controls the world.

09:06.255 --> 09:10.300
Now... if you choose
to remain on this mission,

09:10.384 --> 09:13.470
we're wheels up to the Cape in four hours.
Launch in 48.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.681
-That's fast.
-Yeah.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.182
What are these for?

09:18.809 --> 09:22.312
Well, if our return to Earth
ends up in hostile territory,

09:22.396 --> 09:24.273
we may need to defend ourselves.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.066
You can't be serious.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.068
The Russians do it.
They have since the '60s.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.194
Jesus.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.948
And we can't let Pathfinder end up in
their hands, so we'd need to destroy her.

09:33.532 --> 09:37.536
Look, I realize this isn't what
either of you came to NASA to do.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.999
If you choose to drop out...
I won't hold it against you.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.904
I'm not gonna let you two face the Soviets
with a subpar NERVA technician.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.408
Just one thing, Ed.

10:17.951 --> 10:22.247
What the Russians are saying about
nuclear weapons aboard Sea Dragon 17.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.166
Are there?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.378
Look, I honestly don't know.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.685
What you got, Nick?

10:43.769 --> 10:45.812
A demand from
the Russian commander of Zvezda.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.941
He wants to send a team
to recover his people.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.025
Both of 'em.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.152
He sounds pretty cranky.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.862
Yeah, that's an understatement.

10:54.530 --> 10:55.531
What should I tell him?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.784
That his injured cosmonaut
remains unconscious,

10:58.867 --> 11:01.245
and I will consult my superiors
concerning his request.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.830
That's all? You sure?

11:03.914 --> 11:07.000
Russians understand deferring
to chain of command. It'll buy us time.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.462
Be polite. But not too polite.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.220
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.683
We should get going. That nurse said
it would be good if we got there early.

11:22.766 --> 11:23.809
Okay.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.644
-You read the materials?
-I did.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.522
Pretty mind-blowing, don't you think?

11:28.605 --> 11:30.107
That it is.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.610
Okay. Out with it.

11:34.236 --> 11:37.114
I don't know, just that
injecting antioxidants into your eyes

11:37.197 --> 11:38.949
seems a bit extreme.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.493
Well, so is my glaucoma.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.704
This is the first doctor
who said he can help me.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.372
-Not true. The others said--
-No, no.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.458
The others said they could slow it down,
not stop it. This guy is--

11:48.542 --> 11:51.295
Is telling you exactly
what you want to hear.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.798
Okay, Wayne.
Did you read the case histories?

11:54.882 --> 11:59.845
Ninety-two percent of his patients recover
their sight after just three treatments.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.639
Molly, those are all anecdotal, okay?

12:02.723 --> 12:05.559
He doesn't provide
any supporting research,

12:05.642 --> 12:09.605
no clinical trials, no peer-reviewed
analysis by certified specialists--

12:09.688 --> 12:13.192
Because the medical establishment
is opposed to what he's doing.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.694
And why do you suppose that is?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.406
Because they don't want the competition?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.491
Because all they think about is money?

12:22.201 --> 12:25.662
As opposed to this guy, who wants
ten grand up front and 15 after that

12:25.746 --> 12:29.291
-and whatever the hell--
-Wayne, this is my first ray of hope.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.668
You are not gonna piss all over it!

12:31.752 --> 12:33.587
Molly, this guy is a charlatan.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.964
-You don't know that!
-I do. My father--

12:36.048 --> 12:38.467
Your father was part of
the medical establishment!

12:38.550 --> 12:42.554
Okay. Just stop and listen to me
for one moment, please. All right?

12:43.472 --> 12:45.098
Look, I know you're scared,

12:46.058 --> 12:48.810
but if you go down
to this guy's clip joint in Juárez--

12:48.894 --> 12:51.396
It's not Juárez. It's Guadalajara, okay?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.273
It's not some sleazy border town.

12:53.357 --> 12:56.568
It's a state-of-the-art medical facility.
Did you look at the pictures?

12:56.652 --> 12:58.737
I don't give a damn
about the pictures, Molly!

12:59.863 --> 13:02.366
They wanna stick needles in your eyes!

13:02.449 --> 13:04.618
Okay? Who knows what shit
they put in there!

13:05.285 --> 13:08.455
You could go blind right then,
or get an infection,

13:08.539 --> 13:10.123
or even die.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.085
I'm sorry, but it's just too risky.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.671
I don't know, Wayne.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.965
All I know is I gotta fly.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.844
Okay? And if I don't, then...

13:25.597 --> 13:27.599
I don't know. I don't know.

13:27.683 --> 13:28.809
I don't know.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.152
No. All right. Come on, Molly. I'll drive.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.196
You will not. I'm not blind yet.

13:53.166 --> 13:57.171
At a news briefing this morning,
White House press secretary Larry Speakes

13:57.254 --> 14:00.132
revealed elements of the Soviet
Northern Fleet have been spotted

14:00.215 --> 14:04.344
a hundred miles off the coast of Colombia,
headed for the Panama Canal.

14:04.428 --> 14:08.724
The provocative move comes on the heels
of the Soviet Union's lunar blockade.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.852
All leave has been canceled
for US military personnel,

14:11.935 --> 14:15.022
and Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger announced

14:15.105 --> 14:18.066
American forces have been moved
to DEFCON 3.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.736
That must be why the USS Carl Vinson
and the Third Fleet

14:20.819 --> 14:22.279
left the Philippines last week.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.949
I bet they'll be reaching the canal
anytime now.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.746
What? You're not interested?

14:30.829 --> 14:32.623
Your father just got home.
Dinner's almost ready.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.209
-Make sure there's water on the table.
-I can't stay.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.628
Why not?

14:38.337 --> 14:41.757
Pathfinder's launch got moved up.
Day after tomorrow.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.467
I'm on my way to Ellington now,

14:43.550 --> 14:45.969
but I didn't wanna leave
without seeing you both.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.679
That's so rad.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.097
Why'd they move it up?

14:49.973 --> 14:51.892
Well, that's classified.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.728
Wait, it's not something to do
with Panama, is it?

14:55.562 --> 14:58.065
Are you gonna use the Pathfinder
against the Soviet fleet?

14:58.148 --> 14:59.983
Kelly, he just said he can't tell you.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.155
Are you gonna be okay?

15:05.906 --> 15:07.658
No, he can't promise you that.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.244
He can't.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.288
You wanna be in the navy, Kelly,
this is part of the gig.

15:14.206 --> 15:16.250
Sometimes you get deployed
without any warning,

15:16.834 --> 15:20.003
and the one thing you can never do
is promise the people you leave behind

15:20.087 --> 15:21.588
that you're going to be okay.

15:23.173 --> 15:26.051
'Cause they will hang on to that promise
like it's a lifeline.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.307
And it's not real. Right, Ed?

15:38.355 --> 15:42.526
Look, she's right. I can't promise
that nothing's gonna happen, but...

15:44.695 --> 15:47.322
I feel very confident. Okay?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.576
Any luck, I'll be back
the week after you start school.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.545
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you too, kiddo.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.340
More than you'll ever know.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.894
Walk me to the car?

16:20.606 --> 16:21.607
Okay.

16:34.703 --> 16:35.871
You okay?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.458
I'm fine. I'm just tired.

16:40.459 --> 16:42.252
Is it about the mission?

16:43.587 --> 16:44.588
No.

16:46.757 --> 16:47.758
Then what?

16:51.136 --> 16:53.347
Ed, we'll talk about it
when you get back, okay?

16:54.973 --> 16:56.058
That doesn't sound good.

16:56.141 --> 16:59.811
Yeah. Well, now's not really the time.
You have to focus on Pathfinder.

17:00.896 --> 17:04.358
That's right. And I won't be able to
if you don't tell me what's going on.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.694
Ed, I need to sit with it. I don't--

17:07.778 --> 17:10.196
Sit with what? What are you talking about?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.241
Let it go. We'll talk about it
when you get home.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.617
-Okay?
-No, no, no. No.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.913
No, we made a pact, remember?

17:18.914 --> 17:20.540
-Yeah, I know. I--
-We made a pact.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.292
You and me, we don't keep any secrets
from each other anymore.

17:23.377 --> 17:26.755
I'd never go out on some mission without
knowing what was going on back home.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.757
-Ed. I know.
-No. You need to tell me the truth.

17:28.841 --> 17:30.884
-We wouldn't keep any more secrets.
-Yes, Ed. I know--

17:30.968 --> 17:33.262
Just tell me. Tell me, Karen!

17:33.345 --> 17:34.555
I slept with someone.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.648
You what?

17:45.440 --> 17:46.525
I did.

17:49.319 --> 17:54.616
And I wasn't drunk or crazy
or didn't know what I was doing.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.495
It was a decision that I made.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.042
Who?

18:04.126 --> 18:05.919
Doesn't matter who.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.379
The hell it doesn't.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.091
-Who? Who?
-It was a onetime thing.

18:11.175 --> 18:13.343
It's not gonna happen again, Ed, okay?

18:18.807 --> 18:20.017
What the hell, Karen?

18:21.018 --> 18:24.021
What is this? You want out?

18:24.104 --> 18:27.024
-This is your way of asking for a divorce?
-I don't know. I don't know!

18:27.608 --> 18:29.735
You don't know if you wanna stay
in our marriage?

18:29.818 --> 18:31.945
I don't. I really, really don't anymore.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.032
I think that we need counseling.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.116
Counseling?

18:37.492 --> 18:39.620
To fix things, or blow 'em up?

18:39.703 --> 18:41.622
To figure this out.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.583
We need to figure this out, okay?

18:44.666 --> 18:46.543
When you get back, that's what we'll do.

18:46.627 --> 18:48.462
-We'll go to counseling and figure it out.
-No, no.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.839
You don't get to just drop a bomb
in the middle of our lives

18:50.923 --> 18:53.175
and then just say that
"yeah, we'll figure it out."

18:53.258 --> 18:55.010
No, no. You need to decide.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.138
You need to decide whether this marriage--

18:58.222 --> 19:00.516
us, us--

19:01.266 --> 19:03.602
is something that
you're interested in saving.

19:04.436 --> 19:07.773
Really, Ed? Life's a little
more complicated than that.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.483
Don't give me that bullshit.
It's not complicated.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.860
-You're either in or you're out.
-No, it's not that simple, Ed.

19:11.944 --> 19:14.947
You just don't like to live in the gray.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.406
The gray.

19:16.490 --> 19:19.660
I don't like to live in the gray.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

19:19.743 --> 19:24.581
You like it simple, Ed.
You want up or down, in or out, yes or no.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.252
You live in a perfect binary world
that the rest of us don't live in.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.587
We live in the-- I live in the gray, Ed,

19:30.671 --> 19:33.799
where everything is complicated
and nothing is simple.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.636
Ed.

20:15.007 --> 20:17.718
Webster, it's time.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.191
How many Russians did they say are coming?

20:32.274 --> 20:33.942
The State Department agreed to two.

20:34.026 --> 20:36.612
-What if they bring more?
-They wait outside.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.071
They'll be here in three hours.

20:38.155 --> 20:41.950
All right, I want eyes on both
these assholes every moment they're here.

20:42.034 --> 20:45.162
If one of them has to drop a deuce,
I want a marine in the head with him

20:45.245 --> 20:48.040
to make sure he doesn't dump Semtex
in the plumbing. Am I clear?

20:48.123 --> 20:49.833
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Aye, aye, sir.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.092
Around the globe, thousands are protesting

20:59.176 --> 21:01.553
the United States' recent shooting
of two cosmonauts

21:01.637 --> 21:04.056
in a dispute over lunar mining claims.

21:04.139 --> 21:08.894
In Panama the protesters cheered at
the arrival of the Soviet Northern Fleet.

21:08.977 --> 21:12.814
In a related story, musician John Lennon
will hold his concert for peace

21:12.898 --> 21:14.858
in Madison Square Garden Friday night.

21:14.942 --> 21:17.069
Tickets sold out in mere minutes.

21:17.152 --> 21:19.530
During the rising friction
of the last few months,

21:19.613 --> 21:23.700
Lennon has been an outspoken critic
of both the Americans and the Soviets...

21:37.130 --> 21:38.715
Ready for another one?

21:43.178 --> 21:44.179
Here we are.

22:26.972 --> 22:28.056
Are you okay?

22:30.142 --> 22:31.268
Yeah.

22:31.977 --> 22:35.314
I just need to... slow down a little.

22:37.149 --> 22:40.569
Okay, we'll just slow down a little bit.

22:53.916 --> 22:55.000
Sorry.

23:02.758 --> 23:03.842
Okay.

23:06.512 --> 23:07.554
Sorry.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.724
-It's okay.
-Just...

23:14.061 --> 23:15.479
How long you been divorced?

23:16.939 --> 23:19.316
What makes you think...

23:20.609 --> 23:22.319
Tan lines on your ring finger.

23:23.487 --> 23:25.113
Takes a while for that to go away.

23:27.824 --> 23:28.992
So how long has it been?

23:30.160 --> 23:31.745
It's kinda hard to say.

23:33.205 --> 23:35.165
Divorce hasn't gone through yet.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.418
That is a bad time.

23:39.753 --> 23:40.838
Limbo.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.508
Caught between one world and the next.

23:46.301 --> 23:49.888
Best thing to do is not think about it.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.724
It's okay.

23:53.809 --> 23:55.435
Don't think about anything.

23:57.187 --> 24:02.150
Just be here. Just be right here.

24:02.234 --> 24:03.235
I'm married.

24:03.318 --> 24:04.444
I'm...

24:06.196 --> 24:08.907
I'm not divorced or separated.

24:09.825 --> 24:11.827
I'm just going through a rough spot.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.161
I don't wanna know.

24:15.789 --> 24:16.999
Yeah--

24:21.461 --> 24:22.921
Jesus Christ.

24:31.221 --> 24:32.347
I'm sorry.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.685
Little advice,

24:37.311 --> 24:40.814
make up your mind before you buy somebody
a drink and turn on the charm.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.967
Welcome to Jamestown, Colonel Tsukanov.

25:51.218 --> 25:52.845
Dr. Mayakovsky.

25:52.928 --> 25:55.305
I'm Colonel Rossi, commander of Jamestown.

25:56.682 --> 25:58.642
Where is our comrade?

26:00.435 --> 26:04.398
Your doctor may examine the patient.
You will wait here.

26:04.481 --> 26:07.067
No. I will go with him.

26:08.986 --> 26:10.529
That wasn't the agreement.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.240
You are to wait here.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.743
I can get you a cup of coffee,
if you like.

26:31.717 --> 26:33.427
This way, Doctor.

26:57.242 --> 26:59.119
You keep your medical bay sealed off?

26:59.203 --> 27:01.788
It's routine for a nonambulatory patient.

27:01.872 --> 27:04.166
And the room can double
as a hyperbaric chamber.

27:05.501 --> 27:07.753
Does not seem to have helped
the cosmonaut you shot.

27:08.337 --> 27:09.880
It was a mistake. I--

27:09.963 --> 27:11.924
It was an unprovoked act of aggression.

27:12.007 --> 27:16.053
You should be charged and tried
before an international court.

27:16.136 --> 27:17.638
All of you.

27:17.721 --> 27:20.307
For the moment,
let's keep this to the medical issues.

27:30.651 --> 27:34.154
Pathfinder standing by.
We have a green light.

27:34.238 --> 27:36.406
Standing by for Sea Dragon launch.

28:00.764 --> 28:05.644
All systems green. Sea Dragon launch
confirmed at 4:36 local time.

28:09.189 --> 28:11.608
Pathfinder, Houston.
Just got word from Guam.

28:11.692 --> 28:13.527
Sea Dragon 17 has launched.

28:13.610 --> 28:14.820
Roger that, Houston.

28:17.072 --> 28:18.282
Showtime.

28:20.367 --> 28:24.788
IMU alignment matches FRED's.
RTB window still good.

28:26.874 --> 28:27.875
Commander?

28:35.549 --> 28:36.592
Ed?

28:38.886 --> 28:40.179
Say again, Gary?

28:40.762 --> 28:44.016
I said we have good IMU
and RTB window, skipper.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.810
Copy good IMU and RTB window.

28:51.273 --> 28:55.611
Y'all ready for the inaugural flight
of the most badass nuclear rocket

28:55.694 --> 28:57.529
ever to grace God's green Earth?

28:57.613 --> 28:58.614
Roger that.

28:59.489 --> 29:02.701
Houston, we are configured
for NERVA flight.

29:05.245 --> 29:06.997
Looking good here, Pathfinder.

29:07.706 --> 29:10.918
FRED PLV, Houston is go
for pushover and sep.

29:12.044 --> 29:14.505
FRED rogers go for pushover.

29:14.588 --> 29:19.176
Altitude 25,000, speed 270.

29:19.259 --> 29:23.889
Pushover in three, two, one, pushover.

29:23.972 --> 29:25.891
Houston is go for separation.

29:25.974 --> 29:31.313
Altitude 22,000, speed 270. Launch ready.

29:31.396 --> 29:32.397
Roger, FRED.

29:32.481 --> 29:36.902
Sep in three, two, one.

29:37.653 --> 29:38.862
Separation.

29:41.073 --> 29:42.533
I show good sep.

29:49.581 --> 29:52.292
Pathfinder, FRED is clear for NERVA start.

29:53.001 --> 29:54.336
Roger, FRED.

29:56.171 --> 29:57.256
Let's light 'em up.

29:57.339 --> 30:00.175
-It's all you, Sally.
-All right.

30:02.469 --> 30:05.138
I show green on the control drum actuator.

30:06.098 --> 30:07.808
Throttle control is all yours, skip.

30:17.359 --> 30:18.485
Thought you'd like that.

30:18.569 --> 30:23.323
Houston, we are under nuclear power
and hauling ass.

30:38.839 --> 30:45.762
Engine cutoff in five,
four, three, two, one, cutoff.

30:47.097 --> 30:48.557
Pathfinder is in orbit.

30:50.309 --> 30:51.518
Margo.

30:58.734 --> 31:03.030
How nice of them to keep us in the loop.
Pathfinder's on track for rendezvous.

31:03.113 --> 31:06.658
Copy that.
Sea Dragon rendezvous burn in 20 minutes.

31:08.368 --> 31:09.786
MEC confirmed.

31:09.870 --> 31:13.498
Pathfinder, you're right smack-dab
on trajectory and go for orbit.

31:13.582 --> 31:16.752
Expect Sea Dragon rendezvous burn
in 19 minutes.

31:17.961 --> 31:19.922
Roger, Houston.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.727
Fly a ship into space.

31:34.811 --> 31:36.313
Not launch.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.357
Not blast.

31:39.816 --> 31:40.901
Fly.

31:42.611 --> 31:44.780
That's what we dreamed about
in flight test.

31:46.573 --> 31:50.077
The X-15 could fly so close to space
that we could see it.

31:52.204 --> 31:54.581
Always just out of reach.

32:26.530 --> 32:27.865
Limited penetration.

32:28.490 --> 32:30.075
No bone damage. Good.

32:30.158 --> 32:32.160
Bullet must have hit something before.

32:32.244 --> 32:34.830
Do you have theory as to why
he remains unconscious?

32:34.913 --> 32:39.293
Hypoxia. And possibly DCS from loss of
suit pressure could have knocked him out.

32:39.376 --> 32:40.752
Might have caused brain damage.

32:40.836 --> 32:42.838
We will not know unless he wakes.

32:42.921 --> 32:44.923
I want this to happen
under my supervision.

32:45.007 --> 32:46.967
Please prepare him for travel.

32:47.050 --> 32:48.969
Doctor, you know
he won't survive the trip.

32:49.553 --> 32:50.971
That is your opinion.

32:51.054 --> 32:53.307
He is my countryman.
We are taking him home.

32:53.891 --> 32:55.309
Not while I command Jamestown.

32:55.851 --> 32:57.269
I will protest to my government.

32:57.352 --> 32:58.687
Feel free to do so.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.236
Let me see Ilya Yozhkin.

33:44.650 --> 33:48.362
We suspect the bullet made a spark
when it entered his suit.

33:48.445 --> 33:51.532
Like ours, your suits contain pure oxygen.

34:01.917 --> 34:05.712
-We can help you carry--
-No, you will not touch him! None of you.

34:09.049 --> 34:11.260
We will take care of him.

34:32.822 --> 34:35.492
You know what to do
when you hear the beep, so do it.

34:36.869 --> 34:41.331
Hey, it's me. I have to head to...

34:41.415 --> 34:42.541
Hey.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.043
Was just leaving you a message.

34:48.547 --> 34:50.090
I gotta get to the Cape.

34:50.674 --> 34:54.303
Help prep with the launch of Apollo 75.

34:54.969 --> 34:56.597
Yeah, you need ten grand to do that?

34:57.181 --> 34:59.224
I saw you took the money
out of our savings.

34:59.308 --> 35:01.101
You're going to Guadalajara, aren't you?

35:01.185 --> 35:03.520
Congratulations, Columbo.
You cracked the case.

35:03.604 --> 35:06.857
Yeah, so you're just gonna let some
tent show huckster blind you, or worse?

35:06.940 --> 35:08.150
What do you want from me, Wayne?

35:08.233 --> 35:10.360
Can you imagine me with a white cane?
Can you?

35:10.444 --> 35:13.697
Helping me up and down those stairs,
driving me around,

35:13.780 --> 35:16.408
wiping my ass because
I can't find it anymore?

35:16.491 --> 35:17.534
No. No way.

35:17.618 --> 35:20.204
You do this and I won't be here
when you get back.

35:20.787 --> 35:22.289
Don't be so melodramatic.

35:22.372 --> 35:24.791
No, I've put up with
a lot of shit, Molly. A lot.

35:24.875 --> 35:27.127
Because I love you desperately, right?

35:27.211 --> 35:31.089
But... this is as far as I can go.

35:31.173 --> 35:33.091
I won't watch you do this.

35:34.676 --> 35:36.512
Free at last.

35:36.595 --> 35:39.264
Any idea what a burden you've been
all these years?

35:39.348 --> 35:41.183
Tiptoeing around your phobias--

35:41.266 --> 35:45.187
You wanna talk about fears, Molly?
This right here is cowardice.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.730
-This, cowardice?
-Yes.

35:46.813 --> 35:49.191
Man, I have clung to the back of rockets!

35:49.274 --> 35:51.860
I have been to the moon
more times than I can count!

35:51.944 --> 35:54.613
You can barely watch it on the TV,
but I'm the coward?

35:54.696 --> 35:56.406
No, no, no! Don't do that.

35:56.490 --> 36:00.077
My wheelchair-bound mother in assisted
living has more guts than you do.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.538
Then go live with her.

36:26.562 --> 36:27.896
Thank God.

36:28.689 --> 36:31.942
Hey. Hey, get the doc in here.

36:33.569 --> 36:34.611
Hey.

36:34.695 --> 36:37.030
Easy, buddy. Doc will be here soon.

36:44.788 --> 36:45.789
Zvezda?

36:46.415 --> 36:47.624
No. No.

36:49.042 --> 36:50.919
This is Jamestown Base.

36:54.590 --> 36:56.258
The Americans?

36:56.842 --> 37:00.554
Yes. Yes, we are Americans.

37:01.889 --> 37:04.349
I'm Major Helena Webster.

37:12.691 --> 37:16.945
I wish to defect to United States.

37:24.620 --> 37:26.538
Jamestown is American soil.

37:26.622 --> 37:29.875
The cosmonaut has requested asylum,
and we're going to grant it.

37:32.961 --> 37:35.923
The president told Ambassador Dobrynin
a half hour ago.

37:36.006 --> 37:37.090
His response?

37:37.174 --> 37:40.427
He thinks we're lying.
Holding their man against his will.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.387
They're convinced we're interrogating him.

37:42.471 --> 37:44.556
I find it a bit hard to swallow myself.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.309
I mean, we did shoot the man,
and now he wants to defect.

37:48.018 --> 37:50.062
You ever eaten the food
in the Soviet Union?

37:51.271 --> 37:53.690
Rossi's moved him out of critical care.

37:53.774 --> 37:56.860
So the plan is to transport him down here
on the next shuttle trip later this month.

37:56.944 --> 37:58.570
Okay. Thank you.

38:02.241 --> 38:03.325
Ellen.

38:07.371 --> 38:09.748
You talk to the president
about Apollo-Soyuz?

38:12.584 --> 38:17.631
Not yet. But if he asks my opinion,
I'm gonna recommend that he cancel it.

38:19.341 --> 38:22.594
Don't you...
think that's a little premature?

38:22.678 --> 38:24.429
With everything happening?

38:24.513 --> 38:26.390
I just don't see
how it makes sense anymore.

38:26.473 --> 38:27.516
But--

38:31.228 --> 38:33.897
Why don't we wait to see
what the Russians do?

38:33.981 --> 38:37.609
If they launch Soyuz, it'd be a sign
that they don't want to escalate.

38:39.403 --> 38:42.948
And if they cancel it, then we'll know
we're in for some real trouble.

38:47.077 --> 38:49.913
All right. Let's see how this plays out.

38:53.041 --> 38:54.918
Think you guys will actually go up today?

38:55.002 --> 38:58.213
With all the shit going down with Russia,
don't hold your breath.

39:01.592 --> 39:04.428
Sorry, all jewelry's gotta come off
for launch.

39:08.724 --> 39:11.560
Sorry, I forgot to leave it with the CAO.

39:29.453 --> 39:30.787
Thanks, Liz.

39:37.628 --> 39:39.254
Apollo, this is Launch Control.

39:39.338 --> 39:40.881
We've reached the scheduled hold.

39:40.964 --> 39:44.551
We will resume the count when we have
confirmation that Soyuz has launched.

39:44.635 --> 39:47.429
Roger that, Control. We'll sit tight.

39:54.186 --> 39:55.229
I see.

39:56.897 --> 39:57.940
Yes, we will.

40:00.734 --> 40:01.735
Thank you.

40:03.654 --> 40:04.988
Any word?

40:17.251 --> 40:23.048
"We're human beings with the blood
of a million savage years on our hands.

40:23.674 --> 40:25.133
But we can stop it.

40:25.968 --> 40:28.303
We can admit that we're killers.

40:28.804 --> 40:30.973
But we're not going to kill today.

40:31.598 --> 40:32.850
That's all it takes.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.937
Knowing that we're not
going to kill today."

40:37.938 --> 40:39.565
That's from Star Trek, isn't it?

40:40.232 --> 40:44.570
"A Taste of Armageddon."
Season 1, episode 23.

40:44.653 --> 40:48.782
First aired February 23rd, 1967.

40:49.783 --> 40:50.909
Hard-core.

41:09.386 --> 41:10.721
Hello, Margo.

41:10.804 --> 41:11.972
Hello, Mr. Nikulov.

41:13.515 --> 41:14.933
What's the word?

41:17.436 --> 41:19.605
Soyuz has launched.

41:20.189 --> 41:23.650
Our cosmonauts look forward
to meeting the Apollo crew in space.

41:23.734 --> 41:24.860
Thank you.

41:29.239 --> 41:33.285
Apollo 75, this is Houston.
We got some good news for ya.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.580
Hear ya loud and clear, Houston.

41:37.748 --> 41:40.542
Mr. Sulu, set course for Earth orbit.

41:41.335 --> 41:42.377
Aye, aye, Captain.

42:03.899 --> 42:07.110
Roll complete, Houston. We're on our way.

43:04.751 --> 43:05.878
Wayne?

43:26.940 --> 43:29.443
Hope you got a thing for old blind ladies.

43:38.285 --> 43:42.456
Are you kidding?
White canes and dark glasses turn me on.

43:56.428 --> 43:58.013
I'm dead serious, Lar.

44:00.015 --> 44:03.477
The old man, he thinks the world of Ellen.

44:04.019 --> 44:07.648
And with Calhoun retiring,
it's the perfect time.

44:08.482 --> 44:10.943
The Grand Old Party
needs some fresh faces.

44:11.568 --> 44:13.237
The 22nd District?

44:14.404 --> 44:17.783
She'd be tarred as a carpetbagger,

44:17.866 --> 44:20.202
an East Coast elitist
who eats quiche from a can.

44:21.745 --> 44:25.249
And Ronald Reagan was a Hollywood
actor from hippie-dippie California.

44:26.250 --> 44:29.753
But he claimed the South as
the new bastion of the Republican Party.

44:30.796 --> 44:34.716
I did that for him.
And I can do it for her.

44:38.720 --> 44:42.474
No offense, Lee,
but your tactics are a bit...

44:43.600 --> 44:44.643
Machiavellian.

44:49.857 --> 44:51.525
Are you and Ellen wrestling fans, Lar?

44:52.734 --> 44:56.446
We... don't really follow it.

44:58.282 --> 44:59.616
You should start.

45:01.326 --> 45:05.205
Wrestling is the only
honest sport there is.

45:05.289 --> 45:06.665
Do you know why?

45:07.833 --> 45:10.002
Because it's so obviously dishonest.

45:10.711 --> 45:12.671
I don't know what in the hell
that's supposed to mean.

45:13.964 --> 45:19.553
It means people crave drama
more than truth.

45:20.846 --> 45:23.724
Give the public a villain
and a hero to vanquish 'em,

45:23.807 --> 45:26.143
they'll vote for the hero every time.

45:26.226 --> 45:30.522
And Ellen Wilson? She's a genuine hero
if there ever was one.

45:30.606 --> 45:32.900
Hell, she's the girl who caught the tank.

45:33.609 --> 45:37.321
Congress, it's just the first step.

45:37.863 --> 45:40.365
She could be the first woman president,
for Christ's sake.

45:47.539 --> 45:49.917
I'm sorry,
I hope I didn't interrupt anything.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.293
-Hey, Pam.
-Hi.

45:51.376 --> 45:53.128
This is Lee Atwater.

45:53.212 --> 45:55.130
-Pam's an old friend of Ellen's...
-Hi.

45:55.214 --> 45:56.882
...from the Apollo days.

45:56.965 --> 45:59.134
She's staying with us while she's in town.

45:59.218 --> 46:00.552
Nice to meet you, Pam.

46:01.512 --> 46:04.014
Well, think it over, Lar.

46:04.097 --> 46:05.807
Okay.

46:05.891 --> 46:09.811
I'll be in Houston in a couple of weeks.
Love to get dinner with you and Ellen.

46:10.521 --> 46:12.439
That'd be great. I'll show you out.

46:13.023 --> 46:16.902
-Don't bother. I can find my way.
-Okay.

46:23.534 --> 46:24.785
What was that about?

46:27.579 --> 46:30.624
Lee is the...

46:32.417 --> 46:36.588
special assistant to Ronald Reagan
for Political Affairs.

46:36.672 --> 46:39.007
They want Ellen to run for Congress.

46:39.675 --> 46:42.052
Yeah, I heard. That's amazing.

46:46.473 --> 46:49.434
Did he really mean what he said? About...

46:50.602 --> 46:51.854
Yeah.

46:55.023 --> 46:59.069
It sounds crazy, I know. Right? But...

47:00.612 --> 47:02.531
he's the man that could put her there.

47:03.448 --> 47:05.492
Says she's the perfect candidate.

47:06.660 --> 47:09.872
Well, except... for me.

47:10.581 --> 47:14.126
-Pam, that's not--
-It's true, and you know it.

47:43.947 --> 47:45.240
Dear Ellen,

47:45.324 --> 47:48.535
I'm sorry. You deserve to hear
this from me in person,

47:48.619 --> 47:50.996
but I don't have the courage for that.

47:51.788 --> 47:53.957
You and I owe each other the truth,

47:54.041 --> 47:55.876
and the truth is I still love Elise.

47:56.543 --> 47:59.630
She and I shared a life together,
a life I turned away from

47:59.713 --> 48:03.258
because seeing you brought back a rush
of old and wonderful feelings.

48:03.926 --> 48:06.011
But my heart still belongs to her.

48:06.094 --> 48:07.763
I hope you understand.

48:07.846 --> 48:09.848
Love, Pam.

48:11.308 --> 48:13.936
I thought I heard something.
What are you doing home?

48:17.231 --> 48:18.357
It's from Pam.

48:19.858 --> 48:21.527
She's gone back to Elise.

48:23.278 --> 48:24.446
What?

48:28.825 --> 48:30.577
Oh, Christ.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.331
Oh, God, I'm so sorry, El.

48:36.208 --> 48:37.668
I don't understand.

48:42.673 --> 48:45.008
-I don't understand.
-It's okay.

48:47.803 --> 48:48.846
It's okay.

49:32.264 --> 49:33.265
Hello?

49:35.976 --> 49:40.355
-And what I'm gonna tell you now
-Gordo?

49:41.273 --> 49:45.861
Won't be easy to say

49:47.529 --> 49:50.741
Before I left you

49:50.824 --> 49:53.202
How long have you been behind the curtain?

49:53.285 --> 49:56.872
I was a happy man

49:58.332 --> 50:01.877
Now I've been so lonely

50:03.337 --> 50:09.051
-Since I've been away
-You went for the high note. Okay.

50:09.134 --> 50:12.596
And, girl, I've tried and I know

50:12.679 --> 50:17.643
I can't make it alone
It's such a long way to go

50:17.726 --> 50:20.687
-I just can't make it alone
-Please be quiet.

50:20.771 --> 50:25.484
And there's something in my soul

50:25.567 --> 50:27.277
This is juvenile.

50:27.361 --> 50:28.654
-That's the--
-Stop. Stop.

50:28.737 --> 50:32.324
You cannot seduce me
like one of your 19-year-old space bimbos.

50:32.407 --> 50:34.868
No, no, no. Hey. No expectations.

50:34.952 --> 50:38.413
It's just feelings.
You should try the wine.

50:40.123 --> 50:42.793
Nothing else like it for 240,000 miles.

50:43.460 --> 50:45.212
Smuggled it in a mouthwash bottle.

50:45.921 --> 50:46.964
Oh, God.

50:51.635 --> 50:53.095
That's terrible.

50:54.805 --> 50:56.306
Maybe it is mouthwash.

51:03.814 --> 51:04.982
Oh, God.

51:10.070 --> 51:11.488
I know you, Tracy.

51:13.115 --> 51:16.827
From the first flight in that old Cessna,
you had to be in control.

51:18.203 --> 51:21.415
And from the very first moment I saw you,
I felt out of control.

51:21.498 --> 51:24.585
And it scared the living shit out of me.
And I'm still scared.

51:25.752 --> 51:26.920
But...

51:29.256 --> 51:31.175
I'm just not running from it anymore.

51:40.517 --> 51:43.812
That's one hell of a routine
just to bum a smoke.

52:02.289 --> 52:03.332
You coming?

52:08.587 --> 52:11.215
-I think I'm about to.
-Oh, God.

52:27.022 --> 52:29.900
Jon, I've got four through six
to minimums. What do you see?

52:29.983 --> 52:32.861
Temperature is still in the green.
Steady as a rock, Nat.

52:32.945 --> 52:34.655
Even the black box still looks good.

52:34.738 --> 52:37.241
Maybe one day
the spooks will tell us what it does.

52:37.866 --> 52:39.701
Okay, bring up seven through ten.

52:39.785 --> 52:41.328
Seven through ten, coming up.

52:43.205 --> 52:44.248
Green board.

52:44.331 --> 52:45.541
Good.

52:45.624 --> 52:48.377
Nat, how much longer
before we're back on nuclear power?

52:48.460 --> 52:51.797
We're there now. New fuel rods are in.
We're calibrating the actuators.

52:51.880 --> 52:54.967
Awesome. We can finally quit
the power-saving protocols.

52:55.050 --> 52:56.051
The old man awake?

52:56.134 --> 52:57.928
Your guess is as good as mine.

53:03.141 --> 53:05.894
What the hell is he doing out there?

53:05.978 --> 53:07.104
Who?

53:19.700 --> 53:20.951
We're gonna breach!

53:32.546 --> 53:34.214
Depress! Depress!
