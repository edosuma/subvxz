Of course.

OK.Did you?
Yeah, of course I did.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.360
Right, I'm gonna test you, then.
Give me an example

04:16.360 --> 04:19.160
of an international
sustainability initiative.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.560
Er... energy-efficient agriculture?

OK, nice. That'll get you one mark.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.680

04:27.680 --> 04:29.960
So cool. Let's take

04:29.960 --> 04:32.080

04:32.080 --> 04:35.600

Maybe they could take one.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.920
Did I show you that video?
Thank you.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.000
Morning, Pops.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.200
I thought you weren't gonna miss
any more lessons.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.200
And where were you last night, anyway?

04:48.200 --> 04:50.680
First period doesn't start till nine.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.360
Late, again.
And school's not the only thing

you've been missing out on
lately, is it? Remember?

04:57.640 --> 05:00.400
You were supposed to cover for me
at the antiques fair last Saturday

05:00.400 --> 05:03.520
and help out your Uncle Roy.
He says you bailed on him.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.840
That's a lie.
No, no, no. Come on. That's not on.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.760
You must apologise. OK.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.760
Dad... I'm sorry.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.120
Not to me! To your Uncle Roy.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.240
Nah, Roy's an absolute tool,
man. Come on.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.000
Don't say that. Come on.
Hi!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.280
Well, hello, Layla.
Morning, Martin.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.000
You alright, mate? Boom.
Sup?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.760
Are you hungry?
Yes, please. Our fridge was empty.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.920
Well, help yourself
to whatever's in there and then,

05:27.920 --> 05:30.440
the two of you, get a move on.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.360
Is there anything you wanna say
to your dad before you go?

05:34.920 --> 05:36.920
Anything at all?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.960
Not today.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.240
Thanks.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.120
"Happy birthday, Dad!"
would be nice.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.960
Last night was lit.
Come on! Help me figure out

05:49.960 --> 05:52.120
this stupid website so we can
actually get into uni.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.400
That one.
OK. What is that noise?

05:55.600 --> 05:59.400
Rampage Crew. I heard
they've got a show at that big club.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.560
Literally everyone's going.
I don't care.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.200
As long as Benji comes
to Dad's birthday later.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.400
Are we unpopular?

06:07.400 --> 06:10.440
Abbie, you're one of the most
intelligent people I know.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.600
I'm sure you can work out
the answer to that question.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.880
Yeah, but I mean, we're not really.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.880
I mean, we're not like them.
No, they have three friends,

06:17.880 --> 06:19.960
we have one.
Yeah, but through choice.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.160
I wouldn't call that unpopular.
I'd just call that...

06:22.160 --> 06:25.400
exclusive.
Yeah, we're smashing it.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.920
Erm, excuse me? Yeah,
you in the Christmas jumper.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.880
Could you pick that up, please?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.880
Thank you. Thank you.
Put it straight in the bin.

06:32.880 --> 06:36.360
Yeah. Actually, is that paper?
It should go in the recycling.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.080
Don't roll your eyes at me.
In there. Brilliant.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.440
Thank you so much.
Have a wonderful day.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.400
Also, it's March. Take it off.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.480
Check the video I've got.
What, last night's clip?

06:45.480 --> 06:48.480
Yeah, bro. Benji, you're popping
off, man. Socials are blowing up.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.840
Mm-hmm.
We're selling out tonight.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.040
Yeah, but check out
my drop right here.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.040
Yeah, you were killing it
last night, to be fair.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.080
Can Layla do this, though?
Allow her, man.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.880
Benji Matthews!

07:01.880 --> 07:04.400
That's enough showing off.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.240
Come on. With me. Now!

07:07.240 --> 07:09.800
- Aw, Miss.
- You're good, bro.
Let me know how it goes, man.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.640
Shut up.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.280
Mr Matthews.
Mrs Laverty.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.520
Thank you for coming in
at such short notice.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.800
Benji and his Rampage Crew

07:19.800 --> 07:21.840
were caught on college
grounds last night.

07:21.840 --> 07:26.000
They were trespassing, breaking
and entering, and vandalising.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Unfortunately, I have no option
but to issue a two-week suspension.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.280
Mrs Laverty,
I can only apologise. You.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.720
With me, now.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.240
This is so out of order.
We have been through this.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.680
I've been too soft on you.
From now on, you pay your own way.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.520
Phone, rent, food,

07:43.520 --> 07:45.720
everything, and don't you dare
think about bailing.

07:45.720 --> 07:48.080
Fine but can't I start tomorrow?
I've got practice later.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.680
- No, you don't.
- It's important,
- I can't miss it!
- No more dancing,

07:50.680 --> 07:53.040
Benji. You are done! And so am I. Breaking.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.240
You, get there now
and help your uncle! Quickly!

08:01.320 --> 08:03.440
I just don't know
where I've gone wrong with him.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.080
You're doing alright. It's hard.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.720
You're doing it by yourself.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.240
Er, easy with that chair, mate.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.920

08:13.920 --> 08:16.680

10:05.600 --> 10:08.320
You're considering it, aren't you?

10:08.320 --> 10:11.240
No, he isn't.
He'd never leave the crew behind.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.600
Right, Benj?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.760
Ah! Got ya!

10:15.760 --> 10:18.480
You think you're funny, innit?
I thought I was gonna have to find

10:18.480 --> 10:21.040
a new breaker, bro.
No chance.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.440
I'm the best there is.
'Hi,

10:23.440 --> 10:25.520
this is Kate Robson here.'

10:26.800 --> 10:28.960
Benji, listen,
I'm sorry about earlier.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.320
I was... Oh. You're not there.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.240
OK.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.320
I brought you some hot chocolate.
Can you call your brother, please?

10:37.320 --> 10:40.640
- I don't have his number.
- Why not?
Cos I have nothing to say to him.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.520
And if I did,
he wouldn't wanna hear it anyway.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.800
Right, I'm sure that,
during the course of your life,

10:44.800 --> 10:47.440
a situation will arise where
you will need to call your brother.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.840
He's not my brother.
What? He's adopted!

10:50.840 --> 10:53.640
Oh, my silk pyjamas!
Why did no one tell me?

10:53.640 --> 10:56.080
Dad! You're distracting me.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.000
OK. OK. Alright. OK. Fine.
Thank you.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000

It's one day. One day, Benji.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.920

you're cool cos you can backflip.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.320

Good morning, Trey Matthews.
My best friend,

Trey Matthews. Hello.
What's going on?

19:19.520 --> 19:21.920
OK, you're not gonna believe this,
but we're popular now.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.880
Like, like, actually popular.
See, everyone saw that video

19:24.880 --> 19:27.840
of you destroying Benji and...
I didn't destroy him.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.800
Shh!

19:29.800 --> 19:32.600
That's not how everyone else saw it.
No photos, no photos.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.200
Make sure they get your good side.
Very important for the press.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.120
OK, you've gone viral
on social media.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.960
I'm not on social media.
You are now. I made you an account.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.000
Abbie! No, delete it. No.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.520
Serious. Delete it.
No. I've got followers now.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.920
Trey, I've never had
followers before. It's all very,

19:47.920 --> 19:50.840
very exciting. You know, we could've
been popular this whole time.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.680
Trey, we could've gone to parties.
Everyone thought we were losers,

19:54.680 --> 19:57.160
when we're secretly cooler than
all of them... I'm gonna go.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.280
...this whole time. We...
We are cooler than all of you.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.920
Well, specifically me... Trey?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.920
Next stop,
Durham University.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.240

new voicemail from Kate."

20:36.240 --> 20:39.240
'Hi. If you're hearing this,
then you've been selected

20:39.240 --> 20:42.480
to try out for Team GB.
Auditions are tomorrow

20:42.480 --> 20:44.680
at my studio in Liverpool,
so please make sure

20:44.680 --> 20:47.400

20:47.400 --> 20:49.440
What?
'Good luck.'

20:54.960 --> 20:58.280
Oh, there he is. First

I haven't got in yet.
Well, I know you will.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.440
Ah, good afternoon, Benji.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.800
That's one glass of juice.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.080
Make sure that you add it
to my monthly tab.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.960
I don't know how you're gonna pay
this monthly tab without any income.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.360
Look at your brother there,
going to Durham University.

21:24.360 --> 21:27.160
Typical. The miracle child
can do no wrong.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.240
So, apart from your interview,

21:32.240 --> 21:34.480
did anything else exciting
happen today?

21:34.480 --> 21:36.520
Not really. You?

21:36.520 --> 21:39.840
Not really. I did get a call

21:39.840 --> 21:43.280
from this random woman, though.
That's weird, cos I got a call

21:43.280 --> 21:46.000

I didn't sign up for this.
Shut up, Noel.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.240
Good morning, everyone.

35:08.240 --> 35:12.200
So, there is an element
that I wanna focus on.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.200
Any guesses?

35:14.200 --> 35:16.240
Trust.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.400
Do you trust the people in here?

35:19.400 --> 35:21.600
Cos if there's no trust,
there's no crew.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.480
You two, partner up.
I don't think that's a good...

35:25.480 --> 35:28.120
No, I don't care. Partner up. Erm...

35:28.120 --> 35:30.480
you guys. Er, you, you.

35:30.480 --> 35:34.760
Partner up. Alright,
find a spot and face each other.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.200
OK, it's all about eye contact.

35:38.320 --> 35:41.440
Hold out your hands.
Keeping the eye contact

35:41.440 --> 35:43.480
and taking a step back.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.240
No giggling. That's it.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.840
Keeping the eye contact.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.440
Take another step back.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.560
Right.

35:57.520 --> 36:00.320
And another step...

36:00.320 --> 36:02.440
Keep eye contact.
What are you playing at?

36:02.440 --> 36:04.480
It was an accident.
An accident?

36:05.280 --> 36:07.640
Bro, are you joking me?

36:08.480 --> 36:10.320
Is this cos we're
done being brothers, yeah?

36:10.320 --> 36:12.520
Yeah, it may as well be.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.720
Bro, we never was brothers.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.120
You can't even break.
Benji, stop. Benji.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.120
What are you even doing here?
That's enough now.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.480
Hey! Guys, guys, guys. No, no, no.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.600
Mandem!
No fighting in here. No!

36:25.600 --> 36:28.760
Pattern up!
We're supposed to be training!

36:29.600 --> 36:32.040
If we had a proper coach,
he'd be doing drills with us,

36:32.040 --> 36:35.000
perfecting our moves, doing
something that's gonna help us win.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.440
So, you don't like my training?
Since you brought it up, no.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.040
What we need is someone
that can actually break.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.960
Something other than their own leg.
Woah, chill out.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.840
That's too far.
What do you mean, too far?

36:45.840 --> 36:48.080
Show the lady respect.
What do you mean? I give respect

36:48.080 --> 36:50.840
to people who give it to me.
I'm trying to train!

36:50.840 --> 36:53.360
I'm trying to be the best!
Who's trying to be the best?

36:53.360 --> 36:55.560
Put your hand in the air
if you're trying to be the best.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.200
OK, everyone,
with your hands in the air...

36:58.200 --> 37:00.600
get out, you're done.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.160
Cool.
Very cool.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.680
Some madness.
We don't need it, bro.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.080
If you lot knew anything about this,

37:08.080 --> 37:11.040
you'd get rid of her.
And him. What's he even doing here?

37:11.040 --> 37:13.360
Hey!
Don't forget about my money.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.280
Shut up, bruv. Do your press-ups,
- bro.
- Oh, you need a hug.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.400
Pathetic!

37:18.400 --> 37:20.560
Alright,
everyone, settle down.

37:20.560 --> 37:23.800
For the rest of you, get changed
and join me by the stairs.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.880
Hey, sorry.
Could everyone wait a second?

37:27.880 --> 37:29.920
Can I have everyone's attention?

37:29.920 --> 37:31.960
Come through
and gather round, please.

37:31.960 --> 37:35.120
Well done.
That was really hard.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.840
Really hard. Erm...

37:37.840 --> 37:41.560
Successful breakers will be
contacted in the next few hours,

37:41.560 --> 37:43.400
so don't go too far.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.200
Those who make it,
I'll see you in the morning.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.000
Off you go.

37:51.880 --> 37:54.320
Well, this is... fun, isn't it?

37:54.320 --> 37:58.160
I don't think the three of us have
all hung out together since Junior.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.520
Dad's losing it.
Have you messaged him?

38:03.800 --> 38:07.560
Why would I? He's made it quite clear
how he feels about me breaking.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.320
We really messed it up
for the crew, huh?

38:15.320 --> 38:18.240
Did we get kicked out?
Course we did.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.640
There's no going back now.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.160
We should have heard by now.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.040
Such a waste of time.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.840
Been kicked out of the crew
for nothing.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.880
Guys, it's not the end
of the world if you don't...

38:47.880 --> 38:50.400
It's not the end of your world.
None of this matters to you.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.880
After all this, you get to run off
to uni and be the perfect son.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.800
Do you know how it feels to be
the outcast of this family?

38:59.440 --> 39:02.000
It's Dad. What do I say?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.200
I don't care.
He's calling you, not me.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.760
Hi, Dad.
"Hi, Dad."

39:12.760 --> 39:15.320
I know, sorry. We're kind of...

39:16.240 --> 39:18.080
...in Liverpool?
What?

39:18.080 --> 39:19.880
We're coming back when we...
When you what?

39:19.880 --> 39:21.840
We knew you wouldn't...
Let you go to Liverpool?

39:21.840 --> 39:25.440
Maybe I would've if you'd let me
know what the hell you were doing
there in the first place.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.600
You boys never tell me anything!
We're all together.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.960
Layla's here too.
We're fine. Honestly.

39:29.960 --> 39:33.880

39:33.880 --> 39:35.720

gotta stay in Liverpool tonight.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.720

to explain, I promise.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.640
Did what?
We made the team.

39:42.640 --> 39:45.120

39:54.840 --> 39:56.840
Don't you worry about me.

39:56.840 --> 39:59.120
I'm just enjoying
this little display.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.520
It's nice to see some hugging
instead of fighting.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.000
Yes!
Yes!

40:15.000 --> 40:17.680
We did it.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.840
OK. Well, you're a crew now.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.920
So, get to know each other,

You'll be going home soon, trust me.

Late.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.360
Well done.

49:56.360 --> 49:59.280
You've come a long way. This is it.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.320
Seven of you will be
on the main team.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.520
An eighth will be
our injury reserve who will...

50:04.520 --> 50:06.280
What?

50:06.280 --> 50:08.120
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.

50:08.120 --> 50:09.960
I'll let you off this time.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.360
As I was saying,

50:12.360 --> 50:14.320
one of you will be on the bench

50:14.320 --> 50:16.720
and I know it's not where
any of you wanna be,

50:16.720 --> 50:19.040
but if there is an injury,

50:19.040 --> 50:21.720
you'll be what keeps us
in the competition.

50:22.560 --> 50:25.280
You're not here for a holiday.

50:25.280 --> 50:28.640
You're here to be the best breakers
that you could possibly be.

50:28.640 --> 50:31.320
Are you ready to show that
to the world?

50:31.320 --> 50:33.440
Yeah.
Yes?

50:33.440 --> 50:36.200
Yeah!
OK!

50:36.200 --> 50:39.720
Have a safe journey home
and I'll see you in London.

50:39.720 --> 50:41.640
Can't believe we made it.
Catch you later, my G.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.640
Hey, hopefully,
we'll all see each other soon.

50:43.640 --> 50:46.040
Hey, Trey. Come on, man.
We got a bus to catch.

50:46.040 --> 50:48.840
I cannot believe you boys
would do something like this

50:48.840 --> 50:51.280
without telling me. What have
you got to say for yourselves?

50:51.280 --> 50:53.800
Huh?

50:53.800 --> 50:56.280
We were at try-outs
for the world championships.

50:57.840 --> 51:00.200
Any other parent would be proud.
Of what?

51:00.200 --> 51:02.920
A college dropout and a straight-A
student who wants to throw

51:02.920 --> 51:05.320
his life away to spin on his head?
It's more than that, Dad.

51:05.320 --> 51:08.080
Don't throw your future away, Trey.
You're better than this.

51:08.080 --> 51:10.240
Better than me, you mean?
Listen,

51:10.240 --> 51:13.360
I want what's best for you!
If you just applied yourself

51:13.360 --> 51:15.400
and worked as hard
as your brother here, maybe...

51:15.400 --> 51:17.440
I didn't get into Durham!

51:18.320 --> 51:20.320
I-I froze up in the interview.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.320

51:51.840 --> 51:53.520
No way.

52:01.920 --> 52:03.920
How was I not in the top seven?

52:03.920 --> 52:07.280
I mean, come on. How have you
made the team and I haven't?

52:07.280 --> 52:09.880
You don't care about breaking.
Come on, that's not true.

52:09.880 --> 52:12.240
What? Cos you've thrown
everything else away

52:12.240 --> 52:14.920
and this is all you've got left?
What's going on?

52:16.800 --> 52:19.120
Hello?
I made the team.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.440
Oh, that's great.

52:22.440 --> 52:24.520
Oh. Look, I'm sorry.

52:24.520 --> 52:27.000
No, get off. Don't touch me!

OK, Deb, so what's
your experience been like

56:22.600 --> 56:25.280
coaching the French team recently?
Obviously, this is early days

56:25.280 --> 56:28.120
in my tenure as coach, but,
you know, we're in a good place.

56:28.120 --> 56:30.160
The most important lesson I try
and instil in them

56:30.160 --> 56:33.000
is to focus their energy solely on
themselves, not those around them,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.600
no matter the competition.
Thanks for chatting with us, Deb.

56:35.600 --> 56:39.560

57:01.560 --> 57:04.400

organised Japan,

they're gonna need to embrace
teamwork over raw individual talent.

of the world in breaking.

57:24.640 --> 57:26.640

57:26.640 --> 57:29.080
- Pretty big deal.

- an injury reserve.
- That's great!

57:31.520 --> 57:33.920
No, it's not. I can't just go there

57:33.920 --> 57:36.560

do what I'm supposed to be doing.

57:36.560 --> 57:38.360

57:38.360 --> 57:41.160
gets injured and you're not there?
I told you already, I'm not going.

59:25.120 --> 59:27.160
let's go and get some air.

59:31.480 --> 59:33.880
I think you might be
over-thinking this.

59:34.920 --> 59:36.920
You're living in your head and...

59:36.920 --> 59:39.120
that, my friend, can be dangerous.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.640
You know, I used to have
a breaking partner.

59:43.640 --> 59:45.760
Yeah?
Yeah.

59:45.760 --> 59:48.840
We grew up breaking together.
She was like a sister to me.

59:48.840 --> 59:52.440
She was precise like you are
and I had flair like Benji.

59:52.440 --> 59:55.520
What happened?
Well, I ruined it.

59:55.520 --> 59:59.280
I became so obsessed
with trying to one up her.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.280
I literally broke myself

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.760
trying to prove
that I was better than her.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.200
I cost us our crew,

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.600
my career and our friendship.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.280
Look, you and Benji
are great breakers.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.240
But I cannot, in my right mind,
put you both in this team.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.560
I saw too much of myself
in the both of you and...

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.840
you need to learn
how to support and...

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.680
and galvanise each other in a way
that I wasn't able to do.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.200
Your nerves and his ego
are holding you both back.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.400
Figure that out and then, wow.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.800
There's no limit
to what you can achieve.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.200
I pick the best breakers to win.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.560
You're in a crew now.
Remember that.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.760
We are live here
at the semi-finals

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.680
where Team GB are about to go
head to head with Team Japan.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.440
Come on, Team GB! We believe!

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.960
But before that,
let's head back to the arena

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.600
for the first semi results
between the juggernaut

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.280
that is Team France
and the scrappy Team Sweden.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.080
Judges! What's the verdict?

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.640
France are through to the finals!

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.160
There we have it.
A sweeping victory for Team France.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.480
B-Boy, D-Lux, what have you
gotta say for yourself?

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.200
And there we have it.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.200
Team France make the finals.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.720
Moving on,
Team GB are up next

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.720
in the semi-final against Japan.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.280
Team GB are the underdogs here.
This should be interesting.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
get ready for the semi-finals

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.480
between Team Japan and Team GB.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.360
Are you ready, B-boys and B-girls?
Let's do this!

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.520
Oh, here they come!

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.760
It's the semi-finals!

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.360
Make some noise for Team GB!

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.280
And here they are. Make some noise

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.120
for Team Japan!

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.160
Ready? Right, let's go.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.480
Who's gonna jump in first?

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.200

I'm just now being told
their injury reserve is not on site.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.800
Without him, this may be
the end of Team GB's run.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.840
Benji! Benji!

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.080
OK, guys. Let's make some space
for the paramedics.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.360
We're done.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.320
We need a medic over here!

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.160
Benji?

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.720
Nah, it's done.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.640
Can't believe it.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.240
'Dad,

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.120
I know being around me isn't easy.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.920
You're the best dad
I could possibly ask for

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.480
and I know I've let you down
over and over again.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.120
I'm sorry if I haven't been
good enough for you,

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.000
but that changes today.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Gone to the Championships.'
Oh!

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.280
'I hope I can make you and Mum proud.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.600
And I hope one day...

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.840
...you can forgive me.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.080
Benji.'

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.240
It's nice to see you, Benji.
You too, Coach.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.400
Let's not waste any more time.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.640
It's now down to the judges.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.680
Judge one.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.000
Ooh, and it's one to Team GB!

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.160
Come on!
Yes, GB, yes!

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.080
Er, sorry, guys,

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.120
absolutely no bias here.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.400
This is so intense.
OK, judge number two

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.040
is about to reveal his decision.
Judge two.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.280
And it's Japan!

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.160
OK, we're still in this.
It all lies in this final vote.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.440
Judge three, what's it gonna be?

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.120
Come on, you know it makes sense.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.160
I knew they would, bruv.
These lot are the best.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.040
Go on. Go on.
Let's go, man. Let's go.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.880
Here we go.
Come on, man. It's alright.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.560
Come on.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.760
And now,
it all comes down to this,

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.000
the final judge. Here we go.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.440
Yes!
And it's GB!

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.480
That's official.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.440
Well done, everyone. Well done!

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.720
You guys performed excellently.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.880
What do you have to say
for yourselves?

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.560
OK, so that's it then.
The finals will be Team GB

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.720
against the immovable Team France,
to find out,

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.800
once and for all,
who the best of the best is.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.240
This is a huge showdown.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.480
Former partners turned rivals,
Team France's Debs

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.720
comes face to face
with Team GB's Kate.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.200
D-Lux and them guys.
It's gonna be a hard battle.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.600
It'll be alright.
French fries, remember?

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.160
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.960
welcome to the final!

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.480
Here come the teams. The French
team looking confident as always.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.920
Team GB are now joined
by the injury reserve,

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.680
Benji Matthews.
Let's see what this B-boy can do.

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.480

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.520

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.560
- It's getting out of hand.
- Not sure
if the judges will like that.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.560
They do not look happy.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.000
This is some serious foul play
from both sides.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.480
Such a shame to end
the tournament on such a downer.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.440

the judges have to say.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.200
What the hell was that?
You tried to trip me!

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.160
No, I didn't!
Yes, you did!

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.680
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.360
What is your problem?

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:41.640
You could have got us disqualified
cos of all this fighting.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.400
He started it!

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.480
He couldn't handle me showing him up,
so he tried to trip me. What sort-

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.480
Stop and actually listen
to somebody for once!

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.240
Don't you see what you're doing?

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.400
You're destroying the crew
and your family!

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.520
You just had to be
the centre of attention.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.960
Was it worth it to let
the whole crew down again?

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.640
I get why Rampage Crew
dumped you now.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.840
Hey.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.240
You didn't have to come
- all this way.
- Oh, course I did.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.400
Right, so what actually
happened then?

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.360
Same thing that always happens.
OK, so you did a head spin

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.400
and everyone got mad?
This was all my fault.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:45.200
Because of the head spin?
OK, I'm sorry. I'll be serious.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.920
Cos I came for the wrong reasons.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.400
I wanted to prove something.
Prove what?

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:57.920
That I could. I thought if I showed
Benji I was just as good as him,

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.760
we could be brothers as again.
Instead I just pushed everyone away.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.960
You don't have anything
to prove, Trey.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.920
Look, honestly, you're one
of the best people I know.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.720
You could never push me away.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.880
I know.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.960
Listen, there's something
I need to tell you about uni.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.200
I didn't get in. I know I should've
said something earlier, I just...

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.600
I didn't wanna lose what we have.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.760
You are literally the only person
on the whole planet

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.800
that I can actually talk to.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.720
Well, you're a bit of a cliche,
sitting alone on the steps.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.640
That was tough to watch
out there yesterday.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.200
- What do you want, Debs?
- God,
you really do despise me, don't you?

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.720
Sorry, I've got a lot on mind.
It's not about you, really.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.160
See, this is your problem.
You always thought

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.720
I was trying to make it about me
but I wasn't. You put that on me.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:12.480
You did.
What, I did?

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.560
You forced me out of the crew.

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.240
I didn't, you did that on your own.
I didn't want you to leave.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.000
Anyway, I see the same thing
happening with those boys.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.520
Right, so it's my fault now, is it?

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.000
Sorry, have you just
come out here to gloat?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.840
I'm trying to help you. Stop taking
everything as a personal attack.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.560
So...
...why are you trying to help me?

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.360
Those boys are good.
There's potential there.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.560
And you're their coach,
so don't let it go to waste.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.600
So, what are you saying?

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.800
Think about it.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.560
Hey, bring your A game.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.240
Dad!

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.040
Hello.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.560
Aw.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.880
I came to see how you boys are.

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.680
Did you see what happened?

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.880
Yes.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.080
I just wanted to make you
proud of me, for once.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.960
I couldn't even do that. Hey.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.200
I am proud of you, OK?

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:52.840
But it breaks me
when you guys fight.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.480
You see, it's like I've failed.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.280
Mum would be upset.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.440
You know the thing
she was most proud of?

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.440
It was seeing her boys

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.960
doing the thing they love together.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.800
So, whatever happens...

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.600
...as long as you are together...

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.480
...that's all that matters.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.160
The competition officials
have declared a no-contest

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.160
between Team GB and Team France.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.560
We aren't 100% certain
what this means.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.760
But in the break...
OK. OK. This just in.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.080
Breaking news. To decide a winner,

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.600
there'll be tiebreaker
between two individual breakers.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.520
A solo battle.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.320
Team France have selected,
B-boy D-Lux,

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:05.280
and Team GB,
in a surprising turn of events,

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.000
have selected B-boy Benji.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.360
Benji! Benji!

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.520
I got your text.
What's the emergency?

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.240
Well, talk.

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.640
That's all I wanted to do.
I just wanna talk.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.880
You mean argue?

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.840
I'm not doing this again.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.200
If it wasn't for me,
we'd still be a family.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.000
What?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.480
So this is just a quick chat
- in the gym?
- Oh, Trey, listen, man!

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.520
It was my fault.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.880
I'm the reason
Mum got distracted in the car.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.200
She turned around because of me.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.440
Where's all this coming from?

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.800
Mum didn't die because of you.
Don't.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.480
I insisted on doing that
stupid competition without you.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.520
I'm the reason
we were even in the car.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.400
I'm the reason we were arguing.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.360
That was me.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:11.120
You don't blame me?

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.480
Why would I blame you?

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.560
Cos it was my fault.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.560
So, let's figure out
how to fix this.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.640
We both know I can't beat D-Lux.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.680
No one can.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.920
You see, that's true,
but you know him better than anyone.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.720
So, if I'm gonna stand
a fighting chance...

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.520
...I need your help.

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.000
A'ight, a'ight, a'ight.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.120
So you know what
he's gonna do next, right?

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.360
Bro, he's gonna hit you
with airflares.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.200
Airflare, rollback, one-hand freeze.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:02.000
As soon as you see him rollback,
hit the freeze at the same time.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.600
Just steal his round, yeah?

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.640
So, he's gonna go airflare...

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.040
Yeah? Get it?

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.600
As soon as you see him,
rollback, freeze. Yeah?

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.760
Trey, Trey, stop. This isn't right.

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.880
Bro, it has to be you.
What?

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:39.720
In fact, it needs to be you.
You know his every move.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:42.240
Nobody's studied him more than you.
Yeah, cool,

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.840
he might not have lost in a while,
but our best chance is with you.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.040
No, bro, you're the freestyler.
You know I can't do it.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.080
You just did it.
Of course you can do it.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.120
This is your moment, man. Come on.

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.160
A'ight,
so how do we do this?

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.280
Let's just take the piss.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.040
What?

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.520
Hm. You hit him in his face
with that signature.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.200
Laugh at him
and he'll crumble on stage.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.320
No one does that to D-Lux.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.720
- Yeah? Confidence.
- Yeah.
But once you've done that, bro,

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:19.200
all you need to do is let go.
- Be free.
- That's...

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.760
No. No, no, no. Be free in the
moment. Remember what Kate said?

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:26.080
Musicality. Bro, everything that's
happening around you, own it.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.680
Come on, man. Dance with me.
Let's have a little one. Come on.

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.920
These are your basics, bro.
- Cross step.
- A'ight.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.200
Add some character. Arms.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.040
Don't think, just flow.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.360
OK.Show me!
OK.Show me!

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.560
Yeah, that's simple.
Now make it your own.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.800
Make it your own
without even thinking.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.760
Remember the basics. Never forget
the basics of how we move.

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.400
Use your hands, bro. Come on!

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.000
That's it. That's it.
Now use some energy, bro.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.320
Let me see some Indian step.
Come on. Bap-bap-bap.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.480
Everything I do flows.
Come on. Free up.

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.720
Are you ready

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.760
to battle?

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.720
Are you ready

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.200
for the B-boy solo final?

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.440
WOMAN'S VOICE: Trey?
Breathe, honey. Breathe.

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.960
Ready?

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.680
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.840

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.040
This is it.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.680
..B-boy, D-lux!

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.120
I'll be right there with you.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.640
We all will.

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.400
Whatever comes next,

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.040
we face it together.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.960
We have...

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.480
B-boy Trey!

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.400
Make some noise!

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.240
It's OK. I know today was hard,

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.960
but you'll get to do it
next time, OK?

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.560
Let's go!

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:41.200
You smashed it!
Give it up for our two B-boys,

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.280
D-Lux and Trey!

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.440
Woo!

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.800
Whoever wins this solo battle

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.440
takes the crown for his team.

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.040
The fate of these two B-boys

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:58.880
now lies in the hands
of the judges.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.520
Alright, let's see what the judges
have to say. Fingers crossed.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.920
Judge one.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:11.160
And it goes to D-Lux!

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.240
Right, so that is one to France.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.560
Judge two.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.720
B-boy Trey!

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:20.200
Yes!
Oh, so close.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.320
What's it gonna be?
We have a split decision.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:26.080
It all rests on this last vote,
last chance. Let's go, let's go.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.080
And the winner is...

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.920
...D-Lux!

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.920
Well, that's that then.

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.880
Er, the World Breaking
Championship Invitational,

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.200
the winners are... France.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.880
Trey Matthews
should hold his head high

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.360
because, honestly,
that was one hell of a performance.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:01.080
D-Lux stays on top of the pile,
but Trey, man. Trey.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:03.040
I thought he had that.
So close.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.400
But, er, Team GB are
the real winners here.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.840
I mean, think about it.
Year after year after year,

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.640
not making the quarter-finals,
not even making the semi-finals.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:14.320
The underdogs did it.
And those Matthews brothers!

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:17.360
They are the rising stars
of the breaking world.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.640
Watch out, D-Lux,
cos they're coming for ya.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:22.240
I cannot wait to see

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.880
what Team GB bring next year.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:28.240
We have been Carla and Pete.
