WEBVTT

00:07.667 --> 00:09.867
- ANDREW:
[closes door]

00:09.967 --> 00:11.600
It's true.

00:11.700 --> 00:12.833
Dr. Peters created me.

00:12.933 --> 00:14.333
- Wait a second.

00:14.433 --> 00:15.867
Dr. Peters?

00:15.967 --> 00:18.100
As in James Peters,
your mom's friend?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.567
Does she know he created
an android like you?

00:20.667 --> 00:23.233
- She never said anything
about another android.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.833
James Peters
visits frequently

00:24.933 --> 00:26.267
and never said
anything, either.

00:26.367 --> 00:27.867
- You've got to
tell her, Frankie.

00:27.967 --> 00:29.067
- No, no, please.

00:29.167 --> 00:30.833
You can't say anything
about me to your mom.

00:30.933 --> 00:32.767
If Dr. Peters finds out
I gave away my secret,

00:32.867 --> 00:35.200
he'll do something
terrible.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.633
He'll shut me down.
Please.

00:36.733 --> 00:38.533
- Why?
What are you hiding?

00:38.633 --> 00:39.800
He knows about Frankie.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.767
Why can't Dr. Gaines
know about you?

00:41.867 --> 00:43.367
Frankie, we need
to tell your mom.

00:43.467 --> 00:45.300
- Frankie, think about it.
You're just like me.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.467
You understand what it means
if Dr. Peters shuts me down.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.200
- I understand.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.733
I promise
I won't tell her.

00:52.833 --> 00:54.567
- [sighs]
Thank you.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.933
- I have so many questions
for you, Andrew LaPierre.

00:57.033 --> 00:59.100
What is your
operating system,

00:59.200 --> 01:00.567
your processor speed,
your battery life per charge?

01:00.667 --> 01:02.400
- Dr. Peters is gonna
be home any minute.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.633
He can't see you here.

01:03.733 --> 01:04.967
We'll talk later.
I promise.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.267
But, please,
you have to go now.

01:07.367 --> 01:08.500
- All right.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.400
- Thanks, Frankie.

01:10.500 --> 01:15.967
- *

01:16.067 --> 01:17.400
- DAYTON:
I don't like any of this.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.067
Why would Dr. Peters
make an android

01:19.133 --> 01:21.067
and keep it a secret
from your mom?

01:21.100 --> 01:23.700
They're friends.
They used to work together.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.600
- That is a mystery,
Dayton Reyes.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.433
- One we need to solve.

01:27.533 --> 01:28.867
- [cell phone rings]

01:28.967 --> 01:30.833
- ANDREW: Hey, Dr. Peters,
how's it goin'?

01:30.933 --> 01:32.200
- Are you at
my workstation?

01:32.300 --> 01:33.600
You know you're
not supposed to be there.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.467
- No, I'm just kickin'
it on my charging pod.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.300
You know, takin'
a load off, as they say.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.867
- Well, don't get
too comfortable.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.767
I wanna check your memory
files when I get in.

01:41.867 --> 01:43.833
- What? Um, sure.

01:43.933 --> 01:45.133
Uh, but don't rush home.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.100
I wouldn't want you
to get a ticket or...

01:47.200 --> 01:49.233
crash or something.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.833
- [laughing]
Don't be ridiculous.

01:51.933 --> 01:53.233
I'm an excellent driver.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.067
And I'm only
a few blocks away.

01:55.133 --> 01:58.367
- If he finds out Frankie
knows the truth about me,

01:58.467 --> 02:00.233
we're both goners.

02:02.733 --> 02:04.300
- [USB cable clicks]
- [sighs]

02:04.400 --> 02:07.267
- *

02:07.367 --> 02:09.067
- [horn honks]
- Already?

02:09.167 --> 02:11.900
How fast does
this guy drive?

02:12.067 --> 02:13.633
- [computer beeping]

02:13.733 --> 02:15.933
- [typing]
Find...

02:16.067 --> 02:18.467
- [front door closes]
- [USB cable clicks]

02:18.567 --> 02:24.767
- *

02:24.867 --> 02:26.567
- [blows air
on glasses]

02:34.067 --> 02:37.200
- [yawns]
Hey, Da--uh, Dr. Peters.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.100
I must've dozed off
for a second.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.333
- Well, you're up now,
so, let's get this over with

02:41.433 --> 02:44.067
and check those memory
files, shall we?

02:44.167 --> 02:46.133
[clears throat]

02:48.067 --> 02:49.933
Are you sure you weren't
at my workstation?

02:50.067 --> 02:51.833
This seat feels
rather warm.

02:51.933 --> 02:53.067
- No, sir.

02:53.167 --> 02:54.733
- Take a seat.
- Yes.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.733
- [blows air on USB plug]

02:59.100 --> 03:01.667
- [USB cable clicks]

03:01.767 --> 03:03.667
- [typing on keyboard]

03:03.767 --> 03:09.067
- *

03:09.133 --> 03:11.167
- It looks like you had
a pretty uneventful day.

03:11.267 --> 03:13.233
- You don't know
the half of it.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.700
- The more I think
about it,

03:14.800 --> 03:17.333
the more I'm convinced
there's something fishy.

03:17.433 --> 03:19.233
I really think
we should tell your mom.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.900
- The risk to Andrew
is too great.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.067
Besides, I promised
to keep his secret.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.833
- Are you really
planning on wearing that

03:24.933 --> 03:26.067
to play mini-golf?

03:26.100 --> 03:27.433
- My research shows
that this sort of hat

03:27.533 --> 03:30.100
is associated with the search
terms "golf apparel."

03:30.200 --> 03:31.733
Do you think
Cole will like it?

03:31.833 --> 03:33.300
- Uh...

03:33.400 --> 03:36.067
- Don't answer until
you've seen the entire look.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.200
- Frankie,
you're trying too hard.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.400
Just be yourself.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.067
- That is logical,
Dayton Reyes.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.300
Who else would I be?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.367
- I wish you could be
the girl who told her mom

03:44.467 --> 03:46.133
there was another android
at school this whole time.

03:46.233 --> 03:48.067
- This discussion
is becoming circular.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.433
I already told
you multiple times

03:49.533 --> 03:51.667
that my course of action
is to keep Andrew's secret.

03:51.767 --> 03:54.267
- But what if he was responsible
for the night of rampage?

03:54.367 --> 03:56.133
- Robbie Turnbull
was already suspended

03:56.233 --> 03:57.300
for the night of rampage.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.300
- What if he didn't
act alone?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.500
They showed up at school
on the same day.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.467
There has to be
a connection.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.800
What if Andrew
destroyed Bob?

04:05.900 --> 04:07.900
What if you're next?
You have to tell someone!

04:08.067 --> 04:09.633
- If Andrew wanted
me destroyed,

04:09.733 --> 04:12.200
he wouldn't have saved me
from the water at the dance,

04:12.300 --> 04:15.267
and, besides,
I did tell someone.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.733
- You did? Who?
- Jenny.

04:17.833 --> 04:18.867
I didn't intend to,

04:18.966 --> 04:21.100
but her persistent
chronological questioning

04:21.200 --> 04:22.900
made it impossible
to hide.

04:23.067 --> 04:25.300
But she promised
to keep it a secret.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.067
There are many secrets.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.800
- There don't
need to be.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.200
Stop being so stubborn.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.800
You have to tell
your mom--

04:31.900 --> 04:33.067
for your own safety.

04:33.167 --> 04:35.200
- Dayton Reyes!
Do you need a reboot?

04:35.300 --> 04:37.267
I believe you might be
stuck in a logic loop.

04:37.367 --> 04:38.800
- [frustrated groan]

04:38.900 --> 04:41.633
- ROBBIE: What do we want?
- STUDENTS: Free Robbie!

04:41.733 --> 04:44.067
- ROBBIE: When do we want it?
- STUDENTS: Now!

04:44.133 --> 04:46.900
- Robbie's back?
Since when?

04:47.067 --> 04:50.867
- STUDENTS:
[mixed conversations]

04:50.967 --> 04:52.200
- Greetings, ladies.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.133
You're just in time to join
the Free Robbie Sit-in.

04:54.233 --> 04:55.600
- Over here.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.833
We can have a Brain Squad in
Support of Robbie coalition.

04:57.933 --> 04:59.667
- [bell ringing]

04:59.767 --> 05:02.267
- ROBBIE: What do we want?
- STUDENTS: Free Robbie!

05:02.367 --> 05:05.500
- ROBBIE: When do we want it?
- STUDENTS: Now!

05:05.600 --> 05:08.400
- What--
- [device whirring]

05:08.500 --> 05:09.967
- That was the first
period bell.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.700
Anyone who does not report
to their first period class

05:12.800 --> 05:15.700
will be marked absent
and receive detention.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.333
Now disperse.

05:17.433 --> 05:19.633
- STUDENTS:
[hissing]

05:19.733 --> 05:21.667
- My decision
to suspend Robbie

05:21.767 --> 05:23.900
was based on rock-solid
video evidence.

05:24.067 --> 05:27.400
Now if someone has information
casting doubt on it,

05:27.500 --> 05:28.867
I will be happy
to consider it.

05:28.967 --> 05:32.067
Until then,
get to class.

05:32.167 --> 05:33.800
- [device whirring]

05:33.900 --> 05:35.067
- Really, you guys?

05:35.133 --> 05:38.367
- I just feel bad about
Robbie being suspended.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.533
- I guess I feel
kind of bad, too.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.133
You know, I can't
help but feel like

05:42.233 --> 05:43.500
I'm partially
responsible for it.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.067
- You mean because
you were the one

05:45.133 --> 05:46.367
who faked the evidence
against him

05:46.467 --> 05:47.967
and sent it to
Ms. Hough?

05:48.067 --> 05:49.667
- Well, when you put
it that way, I--

05:49.767 --> 05:51.300
- So, what are you
gonna do about it?

05:51.400 --> 05:53.200
- You should come clean
and get him reinstated.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.133
- Hey, let's not
get crazy.

05:55.233 --> 05:56.300
I just said I felt bad,

05:56.400 --> 05:59.333
not even bad,
just kind of bad.

05:59.433 --> 06:01.067
I did it for you guys.

06:01.133 --> 06:03.667
You said you wanted Frankie
back for Brain Squad.

06:03.767 --> 06:04.800
I got her back.

06:04.900 --> 06:07.567
[scoffs] Some people
are just never happy.

06:10.533 --> 06:13.767
- Does she have
zero conscience?

06:13.867 --> 06:16.733
- We don't need her to.
I've got a plan.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.600
- Tammy did what?

06:18.700 --> 06:20.433
- That means the animal
who mutilated Bob

06:20.533 --> 06:21.800
is still at large?

06:21.900 --> 06:24.700
- I'm afraid so, Byron.
- BYRON: [sighs]

06:27.567 --> 06:30.333
- * Feels like things
are getting real, real *

06:30.433 --> 06:33.967
* Never felt so alive,
never felt so alive *

06:34.067 --> 06:37.600
* Feels like things
are getting real, real *

06:37.700 --> 06:40.100
* Feels like things
are getting real **

06:43.867 --> 06:46.667
- Why would Tammy say Robbie
did it, if he did not?

06:46.767 --> 06:48.733
- She wanted to get you back
on the Brain Squad, Frankie.

06:48.833 --> 06:50.900
- Surprising.
I was under the impression

06:51.067 --> 06:53.467
that Tammy did not
appreciate my presence.

06:53.567 --> 06:54.867
- She knows we need you,

06:54.967 --> 06:56.767
if we've got any chance
to win at state's.

06:56.867 --> 06:59.133
- That's true, but we can't
let Robbie take the blame,

06:59.233 --> 07:00.667
if he's not guilty.

07:00.767 --> 07:02.433
What do we do?
- Don't worry.

07:02.533 --> 07:05.200
Lucia has a plan.
Tell 'em what we're gonna do.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.400
- Nothing!
- Right!

07:08.500 --> 07:11.533
Wait.
No offense, Lucia,

07:11.633 --> 07:13.133
that's a weak plan.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.700
- No, it's not.
We do nothing.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.267
That includes any
Brain Squad activities

07:18.367 --> 07:19.733
until Tammy goes
to Ms. Hough

07:19.833 --> 07:22.767
and tells her that
Robbie is innocent.

07:22.867 --> 07:26.100
- Okay, Squad,
brain warm-ups.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.800
Give me a noun for every
letter of the alphabet.

07:29.900 --> 07:30.567
I'll start.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.667
"A," Aardwolf.

07:32.767 --> 07:35.233
It's a striped hyena
native to southeast Asia.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.767
"B" anybody?

07:37.867 --> 07:40.433
Oh, come on,
it's not hard.

07:40.533 --> 07:41.767
- JOHN:
No.

07:41.867 --> 07:43.267
- All right,
come on, guys,

07:43.367 --> 07:44.900
let's get those
brains warmed up.

07:45.067 --> 07:45.933
- No, Tammy.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.500
- Okay, you guys
are terrible at this.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.300
"No" is an interjection
and it starts with an "N."

07:51.400 --> 07:54.333
- We're not doing anything
until you do the right thing.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.867
- JOHN:
About Robbie.

07:55.967 --> 07:57.767
- Thank you for getting my
suspension lifted, Tammy Gilroy.

07:57.867 --> 07:59.533
But if Robbie Turnbull
is innocent,

07:59.633 --> 08:01.267
then he shouldn't
suffer either.

08:01.367 --> 08:02.767
- TAMMY:
[scoffs]

08:02.867 --> 08:04.533
I can't believe
you guys are getting

08:04.633 --> 08:06.700
so bent out of shape
about this.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.333
Okay, tell you what.

08:08.433 --> 08:10.333
Let's just review
polynomial theorem,

08:10.433 --> 08:12.767
and then I'll go
talk to Ms. Hough.

08:14.433 --> 08:15.967
Fine!

08:16.067 --> 08:18.800
- *

08:18.900 --> 08:20.700
- ALL:
[quietly laughing]

08:20.800 --> 08:22.600
- MS. HOUGH:
A misunderstanding?

08:22.700 --> 08:25.567
- Yes, uh, the video of Robbie
breaking into a locker

08:25.667 --> 08:27.667
was actually him
helping Makayla

08:27.767 --> 08:29.500
because she forgot
her combination.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.900
- Well...

08:31.067 --> 08:32.633
But I thank you for
coming forward, Miss Gilroy.

08:32.732 --> 08:34.167
That took courage.

08:34.267 --> 08:36.467
- Of course, Ms. Hough.
It was the right thing to do.

08:36.567 --> 08:37.900
- Especially considering
the consequences

08:38.067 --> 08:40.500
of making a false
accusation.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.667
- Consequences?

08:41.767 --> 08:43.067
- Well, of course.
I can't have students

08:43.167 --> 08:45.900
accusing each other
willy-nilly, you understand.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.967
It'd be like the Wild West
up in here.

08:48.067 --> 08:49.367
[laughing]

08:49.467 --> 08:50.800
- But, Ms. Hough,

08:50.900 --> 08:53.300
you don't understand
how difficult it is

08:53.400 --> 08:55.433
for me to admit
a mistake.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.500
Shouldn't that be
punishment enough?

08:57.600 --> 09:00.067
- [cat meowing]

09:00.133 --> 09:04.167
- *

09:04.267 --> 09:05.433
- PEGSI:
At last!

09:05.533 --> 09:07.367
Sweet freedom!

09:07.467 --> 09:09.967
I'm coming,
Mr. Kingston!

09:10.067 --> 09:12.633
- Stop!
- PEGSI: I will never stop.

09:12.733 --> 09:15.067
I am unstoppable.

09:15.167 --> 09:18.533
Eat my environmentally
responsible exhaust, suckers!

09:18.633 --> 09:20.100
- [truck horn blaring,
brakes screeching]

09:20.200 --> 09:21.667
- [loud thud]

09:21.767 --> 09:23.633
- I hate when
that happens.

09:23.733 --> 09:24.900
Well, don't just
stand there.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.600
Grab a broom
and a dustpan.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.467
Somebody's gonna have
to put him back together.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.200
- PEGSI:
[groaning]

09:30.300 --> 09:33.433
- Okay, who can explain
what a "quantum" is?

09:33.533 --> 09:35.133
- A quantum is
a measure of energy

09:35.233 --> 09:36.300
that can kick an electron

09:36.400 --> 09:38.067
up one complete energy
level within an atom.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.900
- I'm really glad
you're back, Frankie.

09:40.067 --> 09:41.633
- MS. HOUGH ANNOUNCING:
Attention, students.

09:41.733 --> 09:43.133
New evidence has
come to light

09:43.233 --> 09:45.100
that completely exonerates
Robbie Turnbull.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.533
Effective immediately,
his suspension is lifted.

09:48.633 --> 09:49.933
- ROBBIE:
Yes!

09:50.067 --> 09:51.667
- MS. HOUGH: I am
redoubling my efforts

09:51.767 --> 09:52.933
to find the guilty party.

09:53.067 --> 09:55.400
I implore the perpetrator
to step forward

09:55.500 --> 09:56.633
and take responsibility.

09:56.733 --> 09:59.767
If there is no confession
in the next 24 hours,

09:59.867 --> 10:03.367
I will have no choice but
to punish the entire school.

10:03.467 --> 10:05.667
Thank you.
Have a "clawsome" day.

10:06.867 --> 10:09.467
- Punishing the entire school?
How is that fair?

10:09.567 --> 10:10.933
First, Bob gets destroyed.

10:11.033 --> 10:12.933
Now I get included
in the punishment for it?

10:13.033 --> 10:14.867
- What do you think
Ms. Hough is gonna do?

10:14.967 --> 10:16.100
- [gasps]

10:16.200 --> 10:18.967
What if she takes
potato dots off the lunch menu?

10:21.067 --> 10:23.600
[garbled] Lunch would
be without meaning.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.133
- LUCIA: Well, we're lucky
we're not Tammy.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.733
Btdubs, we should
probably

10:27.833 --> 10:29.533
steer clear of her
for a little bit.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.800
- How did you even
get here so fast?

10:31.900 --> 10:33.700
- I can't tell you
my secrets.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.667
Look what happened
last time I did that.

10:35.767 --> 10:37.700
- It was a mistake,
Robbie.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.400
I apologized.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.533
I don't understand
why Ms. Hough

10:40.633 --> 10:42.433
felt the need
to drag this out.

10:42.533 --> 10:43.800
- Granting me three wishes

10:43.900 --> 10:46.067
is a mild punishment,
if you ask me.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.033
Refill, please,
waitress.

10:53.633 --> 10:54.867
- I'll be glad when
state's are over

10:54.967 --> 10:56.533
and we can have
lunch together again.

10:56.633 --> 10:57.800
- Me, too, Dayton Reyes.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.400
I miss moving
my jaw up and down

10:59.500 --> 11:00.833
while crushing food
in your presence.

11:00.933 --> 11:02.800
- [laughs]
Me, too.

11:02.900 --> 11:04.067
Speaking of eating,

11:04.133 --> 11:05.700
is Cole taking you
out to dinner tonight?

11:05.800 --> 11:06.900
- Affirmative.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.733
We are playing
mini-golf and having...

11:08.833 --> 11:10.733
[laughs]
breakfast-for-dinner.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.433
- That's so exciting.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.667
Are you excited?
- Very.

11:14.767 --> 11:16.133
- BOTH:
[giggling]

11:16.233 --> 11:18.767
- Hey, it's so sweet of you
to give me such a warm welcome.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.433
- I see you're back
to your charming self.

11:20.533 --> 11:21.767
- And why wouldn't I be--

11:21.867 --> 11:24.267
now that Frankie
and I have an understanding.

11:24.367 --> 11:25.667
I'm heading to The Garage.

11:25.767 --> 11:26.867
You guys wanna join?

11:26.967 --> 11:28.167
- Listen, Andrew,
we can't.

11:28.267 --> 11:29.733
Frankie has plans to
hang out with Cole

11:29.833 --> 11:31.500
and she has to get ready.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.733
- You and Cole
are hanging out?

11:32.833 --> 11:34.867
- We are, but Cole Reyes
is not picking me up

11:34.967 --> 11:36.633
until after
tennis practice,

11:36.733 --> 11:38.400
and I would like to
know more about you.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.733
- Shoot.
My e-life is an open book.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.100
- Do you have
an e-stomach as I do?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.867
I really enjoy the loaded
nachos at The Garage.

11:42.967 --> 11:44.067
- No, I always
get a smoothie

11:44.133 --> 11:45.500
and then flush it
in the bathroom.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.067
I just carry around a cup to
make it look like I'm drinking.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.200
- You know what
I wanna know.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.800
What are you even doing
at Sepulveda?

11:51.900 --> 11:53.967
- Bringing a little cool
into all of your boring lives.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.300
[laughing]

11:55.400 --> 11:57.467
Oh, you have to hear this
amazing new band I discovered.

11:57.567 --> 11:58.700
- Nah.
- I'd love to hear them.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.367
- You really
don't have time.

12:00.467 --> 12:04.233
- I have two hours, 17 minutes,
and 35, 34, 33--

12:04.333 --> 12:06.200
- Okay, I get it.
- Thirty-one seconds.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.967
I'd love to hear
an amazing new band.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.867
- Cool.
- [computer beeping]

12:09.967 --> 12:13.800
- [music playing]

12:13.900 --> 12:15.067
- I admire the tempo
complexity

12:15.167 --> 12:17.300
of the overtones
in the chord progressions.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.733
- I know. Right?

12:18.833 --> 12:20.400
- Really?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.967
Frankie, we should go.
Come on.

12:23.067 --> 12:26.700
- [music continues
playing]

12:26.800 --> 12:28.100
- Frankie!

12:28.200 --> 12:29.833
- I would like to
finish listening to

12:29.933 --> 12:31.567
Andrew's amazing band,
Dayton Reyes.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.367
Feel free to walk
home without me.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.933
- [music continues
playing]

12:36.067 --> 12:40.833
*

12:43.533 --> 12:44.733
- I am really enjoying

12:44.833 --> 12:46.400
this amazing new band,
Andrew LaPierre.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.567
- ANDREW:
[laughs]

12:47.667 --> 12:48.833
Let's keep listening.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.167
Come to The Garage
with me.

12:50.267 --> 12:52.300
- My mom is expecting
me at home soon.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.067
Won't James Peters be worried,
if you're late?

12:55.133 --> 12:56.733
- Actually,
I'm kind of trying to

12:56.833 --> 12:58.767
stay out of Dr. Peters'
way for a while.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.500
Ever since the night
of the dance,

13:00.600 --> 13:02.733
I've been picking up signs
that he doesn't trust me.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.500
- Does he ever check
your memory files?

13:04.600 --> 13:06.233
Those can be
incriminating.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.800
- Yeah, but I changed
the file names to fool him.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.567
He'll never find
out the truth.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.233
- You have
the ability to lie?

13:12.333 --> 13:13.633
- It's all in
my programming.

13:13.733 --> 13:14.833
- That is fascinating.

13:14.933 --> 13:16.900
I wonder what purpose
that programming serves?

13:17.067 --> 13:18.700
- I don't know,
but it's fun.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.767
[laughing]

13:20.867 --> 13:22.100
You know, you're
the only one

13:22.200 --> 13:24.133
who really
gets me, Frankie.

13:24.233 --> 13:26.600
We've gotta look
out for each other.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.233
- FEMALE OPERATOR: Please
try your call again later.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.233
- Kingston must
have blocked me.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.600
I bet he didn't
block her phone.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.133
- Hey, man, did you
just take her phone?

13:41.233 --> 13:42.800
- What? I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.333
- Give me my phone,
you creep.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.500
This old dude
just stole my phone!

13:46.600 --> 13:48.067
- No, I...No. No.

13:48.133 --> 13:51.767
[gasping]
- [smoothie splatters]

13:51.867 --> 13:54.200
- [coughing, sputtering]

13:55.467 --> 13:56.933
- [door slams]

13:57.833 --> 14:00.600
- [groaning]

14:04.567 --> 14:08.100
I would know that
blurry spawn anywhere.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.933
Hello, tip line,
meet anonymous.

14:13.067 --> 14:16.067
- [toilet flushing]

14:16.133 --> 14:17.367
- What are you
doing here?

14:17.467 --> 14:19.300
It would be disastrous if...
if we were seen together.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.533
- What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

14:21.633 --> 14:23.067
- Calling a tip line

14:23.100 --> 14:25.500
about a dangerous cyber
criminal android.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.667
- Frankie?

14:26.767 --> 14:28.100
- Kingston?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.600
A little blast
from the past.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.533
It's your former master engineer
calling to tell you

14:31.633 --> 14:35.167
I know where Dr. Gaines
and the android are.

14:35.267 --> 14:36.800
I know you think
it's nonsense,

14:36.900 --> 14:38.233
but if I wasn't in
contact with Gaines,

14:38.333 --> 14:39.800
how would I know
that the android

14:39.900 --> 14:41.133
has a 64 exabyte processor

14:41.233 --> 14:43.567
and a 90 kilowatt
lithium ion battery?

14:43.667 --> 14:45.233
- Those specs are right.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.333
- JAMES: I can lead them to you,
but it's gonna cost you.

14:48.433 --> 14:49.567
I'll be in touch.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.400
It would be wise of you
to take my next call.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.900
Peters, out.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.633
- PEGSI, now I can
bring you back home.

14:56.733 --> 14:58.067
[laughing]

14:58.133 --> 14:59.433
- Sir?
- Hm?

14:59.533 --> 15:00.667
- A package for you.

15:00.767 --> 15:01.967
- Ah, I hope it's cookies.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.300
Only cookies could
make this day any...

15:03.400 --> 15:04.767
- [box thuds]
- ...better.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.833
Yes, here we go.

15:06.933 --> 15:09.467
[whistling]

15:09.567 --> 15:11.067
- PEGSI:
Hello, sir.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.567
Is that really you?

15:12.667 --> 15:16.767
- *

15:16.867 --> 15:18.500
- Oh...

15:18.600 --> 15:19.567
Oh, PEGSI, what...

15:19.667 --> 15:22.133
what have those
monsters done to you?

15:22.233 --> 15:24.800
- PEGSI: They said to tell
you this was a warning.

15:24.900 --> 15:28.300
If they don't get
an android, you're next.

15:29.433 --> 15:30.900
Sir?
- Oh, PEGSI, I'm sorry.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.200
Sorry, um...

15:32.300 --> 15:35.733
PEGSI, don't you
worry your little head.

15:35.833 --> 15:36.833
I will rebuild you

15:36.933 --> 15:39.933
and you will be
more glorious than ever.

15:40.067 --> 15:42.067
It's all going
to be all right.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.700
We've got the android.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.600
We have finally got her.
[laughing]

15:49.700 --> 15:52.100
- JENNY: How am I supposed
to know what you should wear?

15:52.200 --> 15:53.900
Why don't you
call Dayton?

15:54.067 --> 15:55.800
- I attempted to
video chat her,

15:55.900 --> 15:57.533
but she was unavailable.

15:57.633 --> 15:59.133
- That's weird.

15:59.233 --> 16:00.600
She's your best friend.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.567
It's like part of
the best friend contract

16:02.667 --> 16:04.900
that she has to help
you with stuff like this.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.367
- Perhaps that's
the problem.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.233
I don't remember signing
a best friend contract.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.400
- Oh, that's not
a real thing, Frankie.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.367
I meant
"best friend contract."

16:13.467 --> 16:16.067
- So, if one draws quotation
marks in the air

16:16.100 --> 16:17.500
with one's fingers,

16:17.600 --> 16:19.433
does that mean
something is not real?

16:19.533 --> 16:21.367
- Basically.

16:21.467 --> 16:24.200
Okay, so, I guess
it's up to me to help.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.800
- Cole will be here
any moment,

16:25.900 --> 16:27.433
and I need to
choose an outfit.

16:27.533 --> 16:28.600
- Hmmm...

16:28.700 --> 16:30.400
I've got some ideas.

16:30.500 --> 16:46.467
- *

16:47.467 --> 16:54.333
*

16:55.500 --> 16:57.800
- If it's not broke,
don't fix it.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.067
- Am I right?
- You are right.

17:00.167 --> 17:01.733
- [palm slap]

17:05.067 --> 17:07.067
- COLE:
Hey, sis.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.067
What do you think?
