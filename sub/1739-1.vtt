01:00.811 --> 01:02.563
- Forty-five!

01:09.987 --> 01:11.534
And...

01:12.864 --> 01:14.081
Hike!

01:24.835 --> 01:26.007
- Shit, look at him go!

01:42.561 --> 01:44.404
<i>So here I am...</i>

01:44.521 --> 01:46.865
<i>playing ball, getting by,</i>

01:46.982 --> 01:48.359
<i>hottest girl in school.</i>

01:48.483 --> 01:49.860
<i>It's great, right?</i>

01:49.985 --> 01:52.113
<i>That's life, sewn up and tied.</i>

01:52.237 --> 01:55.081
<i>Like how much of an idiot do you have to be</i>

01:55.198 --> 01:57.542
<i>To think that it will always
be that way?</i>

01:57.659 --> 01:59.206
- It's like a dream, right?

02:02.289 --> 02:05.384
- <i>To think that you'll never have
to learn from there</i>

02:05.500 --> 02:08.174
<i>or go through hell,</i>

02:08.294 --> 02:10.013
<i>because you will.</i>

02:11.423 --> 02:13.517
But anyway...
- Hike!

02:25.854 --> 02:27.026
- What was that?

02:28.607 --> 02:30.985
- Richards, clean yourself up.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.578
- Watch yourself, man.
Next time, 15 yards.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.572
- Come on, I slipped.
- Yeah, yeah, let's go.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.574
Let's go!

02:37.699 --> 02:40.293
- Hey, Brad, slip again.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.184
- Richards!

03:14.319 --> 03:17.414
You like that? Huh?
Oh, I know you like that.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.040
Look at that.
Look at your boy!

04:13.962 --> 04:15.464
- What is it, Mom? What's wrong?

04:15.589 --> 04:16.932
- Shh! Can't you hear it?

04:17.048 --> 04:19.267
- Yeah. I hear.
It's just an animal.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.059
- No, I feel it.
It's in the house.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.484
- No!
- It's alright, baby.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.781
It's me. It's Mom.
Oh, you're okay.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.997
Shh... You're okay.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.239
You're okay...

04:44.159 --> 04:46.127
- Mom, my head hurts so bad.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.587
Sweetie...

04:51.166 --> 04:53.246
Cayden Richards...

04:53.627 --> 04:57.677
You've maintained a 3.8 GPA
since the ninth grade.

04:58.757 --> 05:02.261
And suddenly, last semester, 3.4.

05:02.385 --> 05:06.435
Missed classes, declining attitude.
And now, assault.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.684
It's not like you, Richards.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.570
- No, sir.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.530
- Look, son...

05:14.648 --> 05:18.243
your life is created
by the paths you choose as a kid.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.699
To be frank, it's an effed up system.
But there it is.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.327
So tell me, what's the problem?

05:27.786 --> 05:30.665
- I think I'm losing my mind.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.666
- Of course you're not.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.169
You're just young.

05:35.293 --> 05:40.015
And life is complicated.

05:40.131 --> 05:45.262
I mean, senior year
and everything's changing.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.724
I'm scared, too.

05:50.725 --> 05:56.073
Of college, the future,
leaving home...

05:58.024 --> 05:59.446
Leaving me...

06:01.152 --> 06:02.352
Is that what you're afraid of?

06:03.822 --> 06:06.325
- Oh... Jesus...

06:06.449 --> 06:08.577
my head is killing me.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.083
- <i>Cayden...</i>

06:28.471 --> 06:30.348
- Lisa, are you sure?

06:31.641 --> 06:32.688
- Yeah.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.908
<i>Ow!</i>

06:48.033 --> 06:49.033
- Don't stop.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.786
- Oh, my God!

06:51.786 --> 06:52.786
Don't!

06:57.459 --> 07:00.508
Lisa!

07:45.423 --> 07:46.766
Mom? Dad?

07:55.558 --> 07:56.855
Mom! Dad!

08:10.532 --> 08:11.532
No...

08:11.616 --> 08:13.289
Mom...

08:23.086 --> 08:24.258
Whoa. Whoa.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.299
This is 1555.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.347
We have a 17-year-old girl
reporting an assault by her boyfriend.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.188
Seeing signs of violence...
Excuse me, ma'am, sit in the car, please.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.937
- Cayden... It was Cayden.
- Miss?

08:36.057 --> 08:38.525
- He's a monster.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.631
<i>So...</i>

09:00.290 --> 09:02.418
<i>...my parents' murder was big news.</i>

09:02.542 --> 09:06.092
- <i>Cayden did describe dreams
of killing his parents,</i>

09:06.212 --> 09:08.385
<i>of ripping them apart with his teeth.</i>

09:08.506 --> 09:11.385
<i>And the evidence pointed
in just one direction.</i>

09:11.509 --> 09:13.887
- <i>You can read all about his case
in my new book,</i>

09:14.012 --> 09:16.982
<i>"The Danger of Boys",
out this fall.</i>

09:17.098 --> 09:18.270
So <i>I</i> ran.

09:19.976 --> 09:24.823
<i>The police put up a manhunt
but I could smell them coming every time.</i>

09:26.024 --> 09:29.619
<i>As far as a cure went,
all the books agreed there was only one:</i>

09:30.445 --> 09:31.617
<i>suicide.</i>

09:32.572 --> 09:36.293
<i>But to my great shame,
I couldn't bring myself to do it.</i>

09:37.327 --> 09:39.375
<i>The rest was just a load of bullshit.</i>

09:40.622 --> 09:43.842
<i>About silver, wolfsbane, all that crap.</i>

09:45.168 --> 09:47.921
<i>And it wasn't just</i> a <i>full moon thing.</i>

09:48.880 --> 09:51.429
<i>The change was always
a heartbeat away...</i>

09:51.549 --> 09:54.849
<i>Crouched, waiting.</i>

09:57.722 --> 09:59.349
<i>But when the moon was full...</i>

10:02.060 --> 10:03.562
<i>I could feel it...</i>

10:05.230 --> 10:06.527
<i>The animal in me.</i>

10:08.566 --> 10:10.318
Hey, come on, man!

10:10.443 --> 10:13.037
- Just give me a second, alright?!

10:14.572 --> 10:16.916
<i>I lived in constant fear
that I would kill again.</i>

10:18.451 --> 10:21.921
<i>And then one day... I did.</i>

10:26.626 --> 10:27.752
Thanks, buddy.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.348
<i>Lisa, I understand
you were with Cayden</i>

10:40.473 --> 10:42.225
<i>the night of the murders?
- He attacked me.</i>

10:42.725 --> 10:46.650
- <i>Was Cayden angry or upset
over the fact that he was adopted, perhaps?</i>

10:46.771 --> 10:48.239
- <i>What?</i>

10:48.356 --> 10:50.233
<i>I didn't know he was adopted.</i>

10:50.358 --> 10:51.985
- <i>He never mentioned
that he was adopted?</i>

10:52.110 --> 10:54.863
<i>That... was almost funny.</i>

10:55.947 --> 11:00.669
<i>Because up until that exact moment,
I hadn't known it either.</i>

11:00.785 --> 11:03.959
- Do you need a menu, hon?
- Just a coffee. Thanks.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.776
Hey! Leave her alone!

11:34.319 --> 11:35.536
- Turn around, asshole.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.246
- Oh God, please help me!

11:37.363 --> 11:38.785
These guys are batshit!

11:41.367 --> 11:42.994
- Listen to me!

11:44.704 --> 11:48.709
You hit her again...
you're gonna lose that hand.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.216
- Run, kid.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.432
<i>I was trying to do right.</i>

12:00.553 --> 12:02.146
<i>Trying to help out where I could.</i>

12:04.307 --> 12:06.309
- What is it, Robbie?!
Fuck me!

12:06.434 --> 12:08.311
Kill it, Robbie, kill it!

12:11.814 --> 12:12.815
- <i>But...</i>

12:16.069 --> 12:18.117
<i>...every time I let the wolf free,</i>

12:19.697 --> 12:23.167
<i>it was very hard to stop.</i>

12:33.002 --> 12:36.131
<i>Drifting, wandering...</i>

12:36.256 --> 12:40.306
<i>I wasn't looking for an answer,
because there wasn't one.</i>

12:42.011 --> 12:45.766
<i>Of course, that was before I met Wild Joe.</i>

13:14.919 --> 13:18.173
- It's a pretty tough place to be,
ain't it, killer?

13:25.221 --> 13:29.727
- I've seen tougher.
- Ah! I'm speakin' metaphorically, boy.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.067
About life.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.609
It's hard.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.949
- It can be, I guess.
- Yep. Can be.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.330
Ah!

13:50.371 --> 13:53.716
Life is like an onion,
that's what I say.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.131
The more you peel it back,
the more it makes you cry.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.213
Especially when you're afflicted.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.467
You know, like...

14:04.761 --> 14:06.434
afflicted?

14:11.434 --> 14:13.107
- Holy shit.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.820
- Mm-hmm!

14:15.730 --> 14:17.824
What do you mean, you never knew?

14:19.609 --> 14:22.613
Must've had some clue.
- Just tell me how to stop it.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.663
- Stop it?

14:25.990 --> 14:29.210
Why would you want to?
So you can be like them?

14:30.536 --> 14:31.913
Oh!

14:32.330 --> 14:36.085
- What the hell, man?
- Yeah, you! Scum like you!

14:37.168 --> 14:39.842
- What's your problem?
- Want to dance? My card's open.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.268
Why would anyone want to be like that?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.687
- I can't control it.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.230
- Boy, you're not supposed to.

14:53.976 --> 14:57.136
You're a predator, it's what you are.
Didn't your parents not teach you nothing?

14:58.147 --> 14:59.945
- No, they, uh...

15:01.275 --> 15:02.572
they didn't know.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.449
- What, you're gonna tell me
you were adopted...?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.368
- Yeah, that's right.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.916
I was.

15:13.246 --> 15:17.001
- I would have loved to see
the look on their faces

15:17.125 --> 15:18.765
when you turned for the first time, mate.

15:18.876 --> 15:22.005
"Oh, he's a monster!
He's gonna kill us!"

15:24.674 --> 15:26.722
Hey, it's none of my business.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.855
Your real folks,
bet they're from back east,

15:30.972 --> 15:34.977
from the old part
of this pitiful new world.

15:35.101 --> 15:39.197
- I thought you had to get bitten by one
to become one.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.566
- You can do.
But, the bitten ones,

15:41.691 --> 15:44.695
they're not pure,
they're just mutts.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.321
But, the purebred ones,

15:46.446 --> 15:48.119
like you and me,

15:48.239 --> 15:51.539
we were born this way.
- There are others?

15:51.659 --> 15:54.019
- You thought you were the only one
in the whole wide world?

15:54.078 --> 15:55.705
Well, ain't that typical of youth.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.253
- Where are they?
How do I find them?

16:01.544 --> 16:05.048
- Why would I tell you?
- Why wouldn't you?

16:05.173 --> 16:07.722
- Because they're the most vicious,
secretive pack

16:07.842 --> 16:09.560
on God's green Earth, boy.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.769
How do you think I got so pretty?

16:14.682 --> 16:17.310
Shit! Shot my mouth off too much already.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.654
<i>Sayonara.</i>

16:19.770 --> 16:23.070
- Wait, Joe, you know where they are,
you have to tell me how to find them.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.994
- Get your hands off me, boy.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.329
I don't have to tell you shit.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.806
You're not my responsibility, kid.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.621
- I don't know anything about what I am!
- Figure it out yourself!

16:32.742 --> 16:34.244
I have no idea!

16:37.705 --> 16:39.002
Joe, nothing.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.095
- I'll show you the way.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.854
It never came from me.
Do you understand?

16:46.964 --> 16:49.137
- Yeah, yeah, you got it.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.761
I promise you.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.350
- Hear me now, boy.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.395
You ain't gonna like what you find.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.862
- Hey, what's going on over there?

17:04.982 --> 17:06.074
- Nothing, we're just...

17:08.861 --> 17:09.907
Shit!

17:11.821 --> 17:13.950
- Just keep it down, kid.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.147
♪ <i>Oh bad dog</i> ♪

18:20.850 --> 18:23.228
<i>♪ You're such</i> a <i>bad dog ♪</i>

18:59.180 --> 19:00.602
- What can I get you, hon?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.562
- A beer, I guess.

19:09.774 --> 19:10.946
- You just roll into town?

19:11.067 --> 19:12.694
- Yep.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.944
- What for?

19:15.696 --> 19:16.697
- I'm sorry?

19:17.740 --> 19:20.459
- We don't get many tourists,
being up here in the hills and all.

19:22.578 --> 19:26.003
- It's too bad.
Seems like a nice town.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.249
- Sure does.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.215
- Oh, hey, do you know

19:30.670 --> 19:32.468
if there's any work around here?
- Nope.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.998
- You are new here.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.874
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.710
I mean, right?

20:48.831 --> 20:51.675
So, you want to dance?

20:52.376 --> 20:53.753
- I'm not really much of a dancer.

20:54.211 --> 20:58.011
- Come on. Any one of these guys
would love to dance with me.

20:58.132 --> 20:59.850
- I'm sure they would.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.641
That means you'll never be lonely.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.560
<i>- Ugh! Fag.</i>

21:08.100 --> 21:10.319
- Thanks. That's great.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.436
- What's your name?

21:12.980 --> 21:14.232
- Me? My name?

21:15.232 --> 21:17.485
- I'm sorry. Did I stump you?

21:18.736 --> 21:20.784
- No, no. It's, uh...

21:21.447 --> 21:22.869
It's, uh...

21:22.990 --> 21:24.037
Danny.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.203
Daniel.

21:28.704 --> 21:32.425
- Why'd you come here,
Danny, Daniel?

21:32.541 --> 21:36.921
- What? What do you mean?
- I mean, to a bar, alone, at night.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.720
Even the sluttiest girl in town
can't get you to dance.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.391
- What's your name?

21:48.599 --> 21:50.442
- It's, uh...

21:54.647 --> 21:57.742
- Oh, I'm sorry, did I stump you?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.330
Hey...

22:03.447 --> 22:06.667
- Hey, you were hassling my girl.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.752
- I don't know, man.
Who's your girl?

22:11.872 --> 22:13.966
- Her.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.295
She said you grabbed her ass.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.263
Well, she made a mistake.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.724
- Oh, I see.

22:22.091 --> 22:26.562
So she's a liar, with one sweet,
squeezable ass, right?

22:26.679 --> 22:28.977
- Relax, friend, it didn't happen.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.566
- I ain't your friend, dick.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.105
- Hey! Cut it out, Deke!

22:32.476 --> 22:35.400
- Mind your business, Angel.
- This bar is my business.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.070
You wanna get kicked out?
- You can't kick us all out, Angel.

23:00.588 --> 23:05.014
- Okay, look, I'm leaving, alright?

23:05.134 --> 23:06.477
- You're fucking right you are...

23:08.888 --> 23:11.482
...buttercup.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.536
Come on!

23:29.450 --> 23:30.576
I gotta piss.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.302
Hey

23:46.258 --> 23:51.139
- Hey. It's New-Boy Ass-Handler.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.606
- I want to ask you something.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.022
- That's great because I want
to ask you something, too.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.191
Ever think you'd die by teeth?

24:00.898 --> 24:03.697
- Dude, shut the fuck up.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.041
Where did you get this pathetic
half-assed power of yours, huh?

24:11.158 --> 24:12.455
Who gave it to you?

24:18.624 --> 24:19.796
Shit.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.178
Hey, kid.

24:31.053 --> 24:34.227
I hear you say
that you were looking for work?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.393
- I don't know. Did you?

24:40.104 --> 24:41.105
- Yep-

24:56.537 --> 24:59.507
Danny, I'd like you to meet my wife, Clara.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.045
- Welcome, Danny.
It's a pleasure.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.340
We grow soybeans, corn and wheat.

25:04.461 --> 25:07.931
I keep some sheep,
but that's mostly for the wool.

25:08.048 --> 25:11.268
And Clara, she does some weaving
for the shops.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.235
<i>A farm. Who'd have thought?</i>

25:19.351 --> 25:24.152
<i>Hard work, good people,
with no idea of my problems...</i>

25:24.273 --> 25:25.866
<i>and, seemingly, no inclination to pry.</i>

25:26.650 --> 25:28.618
<i>All John asked was that the work got done.</i>

25:29.820 --> 25:32.494
<i>The only drawback was the animals.</i>

25:34.324 --> 25:38.329
<i>I guess they knew a predator
when they smelled one.</i>

25:40.706 --> 25:43.459
<i>But all in all, things are pretty fine.</i>

25:48.672 --> 25:53.178
<i>And for the first time
in a long time, I felt...</i>

25:54.303 --> 25:55.395
<i>safe.</i>

26:00.225 --> 26:02.978
Oh, uh...

26:06.940 --> 26:07.987
<i>Hey-</i>

26:10.027 --> 26:12.029
- New farmhand.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.991
- Uh, pardon me?

26:15.115 --> 26:17.163
- John took you on, just like that.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.213
- Just like what?
Is there a vetting process?

26:25.334 --> 26:26.836
- Where are you from, kid?

26:31.048 --> 26:32.425
- I'm sorry, who are you?

26:33.133 --> 26:34.259
Connor.

26:36.303 --> 26:40.228
I see you've met my new hand, Danny.

26:41.475 --> 26:42.522
- Danny, is it?

26:43.644 --> 26:47.023
- Yeah. He's my nephew from out west.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.899
- Your nephew or Clara's?

26:51.485 --> 26:53.704
- What can we do for you, Connor?

26:55.656 --> 26:58.535
- One of my boys said this kid
jumped him the other night.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.705
- That's not how I remember it.
- Now hang on, Connor.

27:03.789 --> 27:07.714
- Your "boy" and five of his buddies
tried to jump me.

27:07.835 --> 27:10.133
And then later I asked him why.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.218
Alone.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.807
It seemed more fair.

27:13.924 --> 27:16.427
- Uh-huh. How'd that go?

27:17.302 --> 27:20.476
- He ran off, like a bitch.

27:21.723 --> 27:25.444
- To be fair, the guys did try
to gang up on him in the bar.

27:25.561 --> 27:26.858
- Yeah, I saw that.

27:28.188 --> 27:31.158
Thing is, Deke's 6 foot,
runs about a buck-ninety.

27:32.276 --> 27:36.747
So I guess my question is,
why run from a little fella like you?

27:39.074 --> 27:42.169
- I don't know. I guess it's like
my old football coach used to say,

27:42.995 --> 27:46.920
"It's not the size of the dog in the fight,
it's the size of the fight in the dog."

27:47.040 --> 27:49.589
I guess your boy's more of a teacup poodle
than anything.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.928
Day's getting on.
We got work to do.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.055
- I'll catch you later, kid.

28:05.058 --> 28:08.608
Oh... John, one more thing,

28:10.480 --> 28:12.653
I saw you at the bar that night as well.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.243
- Sure. I was there.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.283
- I didn't see the two of you speak.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.126
It's a funny way to treat a nephew.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.794
- Well, to tell you the truth,

28:28.248 --> 28:31.218
I didn't recognize him at first.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.552
Been a long time.

28:34.796 --> 28:38.141
- Guess those eyes aren't
as sharp as they used to be.

28:39.176 --> 28:40.428
- Hmm...

28:50.312 --> 28:53.737
- John, who the hell is that guy?

28:54.441 --> 28:58.036
- Danny, you don't want to know.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.678
What's wrong? What's happening?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.012
- The sheep need feeding.

29:35.774 --> 29:36.866
- No!

29:40.237 --> 29:42.581
- Animal.
- What?

29:43.824 --> 29:46.577
- Well, animals.

29:48.161 --> 29:51.586
Things get scarce, up in the hills.

29:51.707 --> 29:54.176
The wolves come down here to feed.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.470
- Oh...

29:58.088 --> 30:01.058
I see. That's what you...
that's what you think it was?

30:01.174 --> 30:02.892
- What else could it be?

30:04.845 --> 30:06.313
- Oh... that.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.354
Just like you said.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.030
- The poor little bleater.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.567
Ah well, look on the bright side.

30:20.694 --> 30:22.696
- Bright side?

30:22.821 --> 30:25.040
Clara, that smells wonderful.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.750
- Back with gravy.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.244
- Help yourself.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.922
- How often you guys losing sheep?

30:36.710 --> 30:38.132
- Oh, it happens.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.595
The wolves have to eat too, you know.
I'll take that.

30:42.716 --> 30:43.808
- Wolves.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.893
Is that where the town gets its name?

30:46.470 --> 30:47.470
Lupine Ridge?

30:47.512 --> 30:48.764
- What's that?

30:49.931 --> 30:52.400
- Lupine. It means wolf, right?

30:52.517 --> 30:55.896
- Oh! Well, no...

30:56.021 --> 31:00.151
Actually, it means wolf-like.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.118
- What's the difference?

31:03.612 --> 31:05.080
- I don't know.

31:07.324 --> 31:08.371
Mm...

31:10.535 --> 31:12.253
<i>- I am not going to do any killing.</i>

31:12.371 --> 31:13.918
<i>- You will not defend yourself?</i>

31:14.039 --> 31:16.212
<i>- Oh, I'll shoot if I have to.</i>

31:16.333 --> 31:18.927
<i>But I'll shoot to wound, not to kill.</i>

31:19.044 --> 31:22.093
Tonight at <i>11 .</i>

31:22.214 --> 31:25.263
<i>After the discovery of two mutilated
members of a Colorado biker gang</i>

31:25.384 --> 31:27.762
<i>bearing a grisly similarity
to the Cannibal Kid murders,</i>

31:27.886 --> 31:31.607
a <i>frightened nation is asking
where is Cayden...</i>

31:37.771 --> 31:39.489
- Um...

31:39.606 --> 31:41.483
I'm gonna go into town.

31:41.608 --> 31:46.535
- Well, I can see why that would
require you to turn off the TV.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.496
I just, uh...

31:50.617 --> 31:53.837
...thought I'd let you know.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.743
Hey, Cayden.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.590
Your name's Cayden Slaughter, right?

32:41.460 --> 32:42.757
- No, it's...

32:43.170 --> 32:44.171
Who are you?

32:44.296 --> 32:47.266
- I'm Carter Wills.

32:47.382 --> 32:51.182
I'd be your...
your second cousin, I guess.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.520
- My what?
- Listen,

32:52.637 --> 32:55.106
the others might be too afraid to say it,

32:55.223 --> 32:57.351
but you have to haul ass
on out of town, kid,

32:57.476 --> 32:59.399
or you're gonna get us all killed.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.064
- I think you think I'm somebody else.

33:02.189 --> 33:04.157
- No, you think you're somebody else.

33:05.150 --> 33:08.495
And, listen, he doesn't know
who you are yet.

33:08.612 --> 33:11.707
Only a few of us do.
But you think he's not gonna find out?

33:11.823 --> 33:13.791
<i>And when he does...
- Who's gonna find out what'?</i>

33:13.909 --> 33:15.001
What are you talking about?

33:15.118 --> 33:17.712
- You really don't know shit, do you?

33:18.788 --> 33:21.541
It's Connor, man!

33:21.666 --> 33:24.419
Fucking County Police
don't even come up here anymore.

33:24.544 --> 33:27.718
He decides who lives and who dies.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.558
Yeah, he kicked my own fuckin'
brother out of town...

33:30.675 --> 33:32.518
Oh, God...

33:35.680 --> 33:37.102
Jesus...

33:38.099 --> 33:41.148
Get the fuck out of here, kid, please.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.464
Excuse me.

34:09.589 --> 34:12.889
- What? I'm allowed
to have one of these, you know.

34:13.009 --> 34:16.263
- I'm part owner here.
- Stop drinking all our beer, Gail!

34:16.388 --> 34:19.141
- I don't even know what
you're talking about. I don't even know.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.985
- Could I... just... get one of those?
- There you go.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.489
- So, back again.

34:31.610 --> 34:33.612
- Well, it is the only bar in town.

34:34.614 --> 34:37.242
- And how do you find
our little town so far?

34:38.952 --> 34:39.998
- Strange.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.205
Like it's got secrets.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.469
- Hey! Judgy!

34:47.585 --> 34:50.681
How about next time I tell you
when you had... I've had enough?

34:51.715 --> 34:52.806
<i>Okay?
- Okay</i>

34:52.924 --> 34:53.924
- Okay-

34:58.096 --> 34:59.268
- Is she going to be okay?

34:59.389 --> 35:01.983
- Yeah. As okay as she gets.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.693
- How does she keep her job?

35:06.146 --> 35:08.023
- It's tough to fire your own sister.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.535
- Oh, so you really do own this place?

35:11.651 --> 35:14.905
What are you, some kind
of small-town princess or something?

35:18.033 --> 35:20.582
- Small-town heiress, actually.

35:20.702 --> 35:23.046
Both our parents are dead.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.421
- Oh... I'm...

35:27.542 --> 35:28.589
I'm sorry.

35:32.297 --> 35:36.427
Both of my parents are... dead... as well.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.022
- Well, then...

35:53.652 --> 35:55.245
A tribute to orphans.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.100
Hey, buddy.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.028
- So...

36:34.609 --> 36:35.906
what's up, fellas?

36:37.237 --> 36:38.910
- Saw you talking to the kid, Carter.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.617
- What kid?

36:43.451 --> 36:45.704
- The one Tollerman's
been keeping out on his farm.

36:46.871 --> 36:50.546
- Oh, yeah. That asshole.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.920
- What did you tell him, exactly?

36:54.045 --> 36:56.298
- Tell him? Nothing.

36:57.340 --> 37:01.140
Well, just to get the fuck out of town,
you know. Hit the road.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.604
- Why's that?

37:03.888 --> 37:07.267
- 'Cause I saw him
sniffing around Angelina.

37:07.392 --> 37:11.363
I figured maybe he was pissing you off.

37:11.479 --> 37:12.651
- You told him about me?

37:13.606 --> 37:16.780
- No... Shit, no. Nothing.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.245
- That's funny.
I thought I heard my name.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.535
- No. Hell, no, Connor.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.667
I just played it off as, you know,

37:24.784 --> 37:28.038
"Small town, we don't like outsiders
so fuck off." You know'?

37:29.497 --> 37:30.544
- Hmm...

37:33.501 --> 37:34.861
I'm having a problem here, Carter.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.847
See, I know this kid's
from one of the old lines.

37:37.964 --> 37:40.262
Maybe he's from here
or maybe he's from down east,

37:40.383 --> 37:41.885
from the Synod. Maybe.

37:42.969 --> 37:46.769
But what I'm really trying to figure out
is why Tollerman took him on so quick.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.444
And also why the fuck a useless drunk
like you would take any interest in him.

37:53.062 --> 37:57.693
I feel like secrets are being kept from me.

37:58.818 --> 38:01.947
- No, listen, you know what I know.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.413
- So you didn't tell him
anything about us?

38:06.534 --> 38:09.333
And you got nothing
to tell me about him?

38:09.454 --> 38:12.674
- No, no, Connor, no way.
You gotta believe me.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.045
- And this has nothing to do
with your brother Joe?

38:18.755 --> 38:22.510
You tell me right now,
who is this fucking kid, huh?

38:22.634 --> 38:23.681
What's he doing here?

38:24.552 --> 38:27.305
And can I tear his fucking guts out
without facing any backlash?

38:27.430 --> 38:29.023
- No, I don't know. I don't.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.687
I don't know anything.

38:31.643 --> 38:35.238
I just tried to get him to fucking leave,
save us all a bunch of trouble.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.452
- That sounds believable.

38:51.454 --> 38:54.628
So now I guess the one thing left to do
is to make sure that you...

38:54.749 --> 38:57.923
don't tell him anything else
before I'm ready to deal with him.

38:58.044 --> 39:01.173
- I won't, I won't... I swear it.

39:03.383 --> 39:07.684
- No, Carter. You know what a promise
from your family means to me?

39:08.763 --> 39:11.061
Going to have ourselves
a night hunt, boys!

39:11.182 --> 39:13.310
Yeah!

39:14.310 --> 39:15.937
- You know how this works, Carter.

39:16.813 --> 39:18.065
So run!

39:19.691 --> 39:21.113
Yeah...

39:21.818 --> 39:25.618
One, two, three, four...

39:25.738 --> 39:27.115
Ready or not...

39:28.074 --> 39:30.452
here we come!

39:34.998 --> 39:38.719
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you!

40:10.658 --> 40:12.126
You smell that?

40:12.243 --> 40:13.836
- Oh my God!

40:13.953 --> 40:18.754
- Sorry.
You smell that, right, that reek?

40:19.334 --> 40:23.214
- Yeah. Can you?
- We're downwind.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.498
An asthmatic with a head cold
could smell it from here.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.263
- What are you doing out here?

40:27.383 --> 40:30.728
- They've killed someone.
I need to find out who.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.563
Shh...

40:39.687 --> 40:43.658
Okay, you can look,
but don't make a sound.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.702
- No way.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.913
- To Connor!

41:14.097 --> 41:16.441
- What are they eating?

41:17.934 --> 41:21.279
- His name's Carter.
Carter Wills.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.829
- Jesus.
- We gotta go.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.963
Come on. Now!
- Ugh!

41:54.554 --> 41:55.601
They were...

41:57.765 --> 41:58.937
They were, all of them...

41:59.058 --> 42:01.732
- Wolves, yeah...

42:03.062 --> 42:04.564
Just like you.

42:09.277 --> 42:12.121
<i>...a star student,
a gifted athlete,</i>

42:12.238 --> 42:15.162
<i>but no one suspected
the insanity that lay within...</i>

42:15.283 --> 42:18.082
- Great, they're playing that crap now.
- No, son.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.830
We had it TiVo'd.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.254
- Oh, Cayden, I am so sorry.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.548
I'm so sorry.

42:29.255 --> 42:32.976
- What are you sorry about?
It's not your fault.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.639
- No, son.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.097
It's my fault.

42:50.610 --> 42:51.702
Ah!

42:52.904 --> 42:54.998
This is your mother.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.114
- My mother?

42:56.699 --> 42:59.418
- Lucinda was my sister's girl.

42:59.535 --> 43:00.775
What a beauty she was.

43:02.747 --> 43:08.049
- We've been here a long time,
werewolves of the Eastern Coast.

43:09.796 --> 43:12.970
We came here on the ships,
the first ships.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.974
Of course, there's not many
of the old lines left.

43:17.095 --> 43:20.645
Most of us paired up with the locals,
thinning the breed.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.483
Like this one here.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.978
Too beautiful to resist.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.322
- I'm not part of the pack, you see.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.657
I just like men with chest hair.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.619
- There's two ways
to become a wolf, Cayden.

43:34.570 --> 43:40.168
You can be born into it,
like you, me, Angel and her sister.

43:40.910 --> 43:44.540
Or you can be infected with it,
bitten by a purebred.

43:44.664 --> 43:45.711
But those...

43:46.916 --> 43:50.762
those will never have
the power of a pure-born wolf.

43:50.878 --> 43:54.758
They'll change, but it's weaker, diluted.

43:57.135 --> 43:59.058
Now, Connory Slaughter...

44:00.179 --> 44:05.686
He is one of the last
of the purebred wolves for miles.

44:07.311 --> 44:11.782
<i>All this really started
when Lucinda caught his eye.</i>

44:11.899 --> 44:13.822
<i>She was a town wolf.</i>

44:13.943 --> 44:16.537
<i>One of the last of the pure lines.</i>

44:16.654 --> 44:19.498
<i>In his eyes, she was made for him.</i>

44:21.534 --> 44:25.209
<i>He came in the night and took her by force.</i>

44:27.123 --> 44:29.217
Lucinda got pregnant...

44:29.333 --> 44:30.835
with you.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.802
- What?

44:37.341 --> 44:38.433
No...

44:39.343 --> 44:41.437
John, what you're saying is that...

44:42.346 --> 44:45.190
that that asshole up in the hills is...

44:47.351 --> 44:49.479
is my father?

44:51.147 --> 44:53.821
- By blood he is, yeah.

44:56.277 --> 44:59.747
When her father found out
she was pregnant,

45:00.489 --> 45:02.537
<i>he threatened to kill her.</i>

45:02.658 --> 45:06.037
<i>So we faked Lucinda's death.</i>

45:07.038 --> 45:11.589
<i>I hid her away in our cellar
till she came to term.</i>

45:11.709 --> 45:17.432
<i>We agreed that Connor must never find out
about you, Cayden.</i>

45:17.548 --> 45:22.520
<i>So I convinced Lucinda
to give you up for adoption.</i>

45:23.262 --> 45:26.766
- Broken-hearted, she let you go.

45:28.184 --> 45:30.983
- And she killed herself that September.

45:33.689 --> 45:37.489
<i>Once Lucinda was gone,
Connor got worse.</i>

45:38.569 --> 45:40.742
<i>He formed</i> a <i>savage pack.</i>

45:40.863 --> 45:43.582
<i>He bit them, changed them...</i>

45:43.699 --> 45:47.875
<i>They moved up into those hills there,
to run and hunt and kill.</i>

45:49.288 --> 45:52.292
<i>Spending less and less time
in human form.</i>

45:52.416 --> 45:56.717
<i>It gets into you, you see, the wild.</i>

46:00.424 --> 46:04.679
So, the deal was they'd live up there

46:04.804 --> 46:07.227
and none of us town wolves
would interfere with them.

46:07.348 --> 46:11.069
And we would both keep the secret
from the outside.

46:11.185 --> 46:12.687
But now...

46:14.939 --> 46:20.446
now Connor's getting older
and he's thinking about his legacy.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.535
- Meaning what, exactly?

46:25.366 --> 46:27.414
- Now that she's come of age...

46:30.454 --> 46:32.252
Connor intends to have a son...

46:33.958 --> 46:37.383
with one of the last
purebred wolves in town.

46:41.549 --> 46:42.721
- No!

46:43.426 --> 46:44.643
- Yeah. That's the deal.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.103
- When?

46:47.346 --> 46:48.466
- When he decides it's time.

46:49.056 --> 46:50.558
- You're just gonna go along with it?
- I have to.

46:50.683 --> 46:53.152
If I back out, if I try to leave...

46:53.269 --> 46:56.398
he'll murder John, Clara,
my sister, everyone.

46:57.690 --> 46:59.408
- Jesus!

46:59.525 --> 47:00.742
- Cayden, stop.

47:02.278 --> 47:03.530
He doesn't care about the law.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.327
He doesn't care if he dies.

47:05.448 --> 47:07.871
He'll butcher anyone
that stands in his way.

47:07.992 --> 47:10.871
- Is it what you want?
- What I want?

47:11.787 --> 47:15.212
I want to move to a city.
Live my life.

47:15.958 --> 47:19.212
But this is the only way
I can protect the people that I love.

47:20.379 --> 47:23.679
If I give him a son, he'll let me go.

47:23.799 --> 47:25.051
Then, I'll be free.

47:25.718 --> 47:27.061
- A son.

47:27.762 --> 47:29.389
Like me.

47:29.513 --> 47:31.936
And then this whole thing
goes on and on.

47:32.058 --> 47:34.356
- Yeah, well, it's been going on forever.

47:36.771 --> 47:38.614
You shouldn't have come back here.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.151
You're too good for this place.

47:43.819 --> 47:44.945
- Don't say that.

47:46.238 --> 47:47.535
- Why not?

47:48.324 --> 47:49.371
- Because...

47:51.535 --> 47:53.537
I... I killed my parents.

47:56.624 --> 47:58.251
I don't remember it.

47:58.376 --> 48:02.426
I just woke up and they were dead,
torn apart.

48:04.382 --> 48:10.310
- You know, my father,
he was a world champion drunk, my dad.

48:12.765 --> 48:14.984
He killed my mom one full moon.

48:18.729 --> 48:23.075
He came home drunk, angry,
and he just...

48:25.778 --> 48:27.826
When he came around
and he found her...

48:28.781 --> 48:30.454
he cut his own throat.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.254
Gail and I kicked it around for years.

48:36.872 --> 48:40.797
Was it the wolf that killed
our mom, or the man?

48:42.336 --> 48:44.430
Or just the booze?
I don't know.

48:46.298 --> 48:49.347
It always seemed to be in him somehow,

48:49.468 --> 48:52.563
that potential for blind murder.

48:54.306 --> 48:57.856
The thing is,
it doesn't seem to be in you.

48:58.853 --> 49:00.355
- Well, it is.

49:02.064 --> 49:03.190
The moonlight.

49:04.150 --> 49:05.948
The violence.

49:06.068 --> 49:08.287
I feel it.
- I know.

49:08.404 --> 49:10.031
I can feel it, too.

49:11.073 --> 49:13.496
But that's our big question, right?

49:13.617 --> 49:16.962
Is it a gift or a curse?

49:17.955 --> 49:21.175
- So, which is it?

49:22.293 --> 49:24.295
- Come on. I'll show you.

49:36.348 --> 49:38.316
<i>Seeing things the way we see them.</i>

49:39.685 --> 49:41.403
<i>The scents, the sounds...</i>

49:45.107 --> 49:47.030
<i>This bond with nature.</i>

49:53.282 --> 49:55.876
<i>Mama always said it was a power...</i>

49:55.993 --> 49:57.290
<i>and a gift.</i>

50:01.207 --> 50:04.051
There. You feel that? Cayden?

50:10.216 --> 50:14.687
- So... what do we do?
Let the beast run wild?

50:14.803 --> 50:16.805
Let it kill whoever gets in our way?

50:16.931 --> 50:20.151
- Of course not.
We use it, learn to control it.

50:20.935 --> 50:24.940
And we'd only ever kill
anyone who threatens the ones we love.

50:25.981 --> 50:28.530
- That's... really hot.

50:32.071 --> 50:36.577
Angel, that's, uh...
that's not a good idea.

50:36.700 --> 50:41.001
- Really? 'Cause it seems
like a pretty good idea.

50:42.289 --> 50:46.886
- It's been a long, long time since...

50:47.920 --> 50:49.137
- What?

50:49.255 --> 50:51.929
Wait, not... never?

50:52.049 --> 50:54.848
- No, not never, exactly.

50:54.969 --> 50:59.190
Just... rarely without...

51:00.224 --> 51:01.567
incident.

51:02.101 --> 51:03.353
- I see.

51:04.395 --> 51:08.866
You're afraid the excitement,
the adrenaline...

51:09.608 --> 51:12.908
might make you change.
- Yeah, that's right.

51:13.028 --> 51:16.328
<i>Okay?
- Okay</i>

51:17.741 --> 51:18.788
So what?

51:20.786 --> 51:22.584
I mean, if anything were to happen...

51:23.747 --> 51:25.215
That's how I'd want it.

52:42.076 --> 52:43.703
Hello in the barn?

52:46.830 --> 52:49.128
- Hello?
- Just a sec!

52:53.754 --> 52:56.052
Ugh!
Hey, John.

52:57.132 --> 53:00.602
- Hey, yourself.
How's things?

53:01.970 --> 53:03.813
- Good.
- Yeah, good.

53:03.931 --> 53:06.400
- Very... very good.
I think we're all...

53:07.434 --> 53:09.152
I think we're all pretty good.
- Good.

53:09.269 --> 53:13.365
And where's Angel?
Has she gone home?

53:13.482 --> 53:15.325
Uh, no! Up here!

53:16.860 --> 53:19.739
Hey, John?
- Yeah?

53:19.863 --> 53:23.618
- Do you think Clara might have a blouse
or something I can borrow?

53:23.742 --> 53:25.119
- Oh, we'll see.

53:26.161 --> 53:29.882
Clara! Take off your shirt!

53:43.220 --> 53:45.723
Larson, it's a matter of defending
ourselves. - It's suicide.

53:45.848 --> 53:47.368
We can't fight...
- We gotta do it now!

53:47.433 --> 53:49.435
- You know what they left
of my little brother?

53:49.560 --> 53:51.312
- Well...
- Here's your coffee, gentlemen.

53:55.816 --> 53:57.784
- Ah, here he is.

53:59.236 --> 54:00.283
Cayden...

54:01.572 --> 54:05.827
these are the town wolves.
This is all that's left of the old lines.

54:07.453 --> 54:12.755
And everyone, this... is Lucinda's boy.

54:12.875 --> 54:15.378
- I knew... I knew that scent!

54:15.502 --> 54:18.005
I knew it the first time I saw him.
Didn't I say it?

54:18.130 --> 54:20.724
- We all said it, Gail.
- I said it first.

54:23.761 --> 54:25.479
- This is Larson Wills.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.482
He would be your second cousin, I guess.

54:28.599 --> 54:31.944
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, kid.

54:32.060 --> 54:33.460
You know my little brother, Carter,

54:33.854 --> 54:37.074
he was your cousin too.
Now he's just today's dinner.

54:38.025 --> 54:40.699
- I'm sorry.
I didn't plan for any of this to happen.

54:40.819 --> 54:42.787
- Hear that, everybody?
He didn't come here

54:42.905 --> 54:46.330
to kick the hornet's nest,
it just got kicked.

54:46.450 --> 54:50.796
- Cayden came back because he belongs here.
- We all get to pay the price for it, Clara.

54:50.913 --> 54:54.383
- And this is Mayor Robinson.
He's an optimist.

54:54.500 --> 54:57.424
No, John, I'm a realist.

54:57.544 --> 54:59.091
Connor is getting paranoid.

54:59.505 --> 55:03.851
If he thinks this kid has come here
to... interfere with Angelina,

55:03.967 --> 55:07.471
then he and his pack are gonna come down
from those hills and they'll kill him.

55:07.596 --> 55:09.849
And then they're gonna kill us
for trying to hide him.

55:09.973 --> 55:11.190
- Maybe they won't.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.026
- Are you nuts?

55:13.143 --> 55:14.440
This close to the full moon?

55:14.770 --> 55:17.023
Shit, even I can barely keep
from freaking out.

55:17.147 --> 55:19.024
- When is the full moon?
- Tomorrow night.

55:19.149 --> 55:21.527
- Halloween.
Jesus.

55:21.652 --> 55:25.532
- Well, hey. What's more Halloween
than getting eaten by a wolf man?

55:29.076 --> 55:32.205
God, lighten up.

55:32.329 --> 55:36.630
- Listen, he's getting crazier and crazier.
We got one option.

55:38.126 --> 55:41.346
Give him Angelina...
and give him the kid.

55:41.463 --> 55:43.511
- You're a real hero, Larson Wills.

55:43.632 --> 55:45.851
- At least Angel survives.
Don't you get that?

55:45.968 --> 55:48.187
- They're your own flesh and blood!
- No!

55:48.303 --> 55:52.228
This is my flesh and blood.
- Alright, alright, calm down, Larson.

55:52.349 --> 55:53.726
Just calm down here.

55:54.685 --> 55:58.735
Now... we like to pretend...

55:59.898 --> 56:01.741
that we have got an uneasy peace

56:01.859 --> 56:04.237
with Connor and his pack up there.

56:04.361 --> 56:07.865
Sometimes some livestock goes missing.

56:09.825 --> 56:12.294
Sometimes a child goes missing.

56:14.079 --> 56:18.084
But there's not one of us
who can't follow that scent.

56:18.208 --> 56:22.805
There's not one of us
who doesn't know where that child's gone.

56:22.921 --> 56:24.343
- Yes, John, it happens,

56:25.090 --> 56:29.266
but it's not fear that stops us from
doing anything about it, it's practicality.

56:29.386 --> 56:31.935
Those guys up there are wolves
all the time.

56:32.055 --> 56:34.808
- Hell, John, some of us
ain't even changed in years.

56:34.933 --> 56:37.311
- I can't even barely grow
my sideburns anymore.

56:38.270 --> 56:39.567
It's just a little fuzz.

56:39.688 --> 56:41.611
- He's the youngest and the strongest.

56:41.732 --> 56:46.579
Connor kills him, he'll have
no more reason to come after us.

56:46.695 --> 56:49.118
- And then what?
Then we just give him Angelina?

56:50.282 --> 56:51.784
- That was the deal we made.

56:51.909 --> 56:54.287
- The deal I made.
- Well, I didn't.

56:56.872 --> 56:58.920
Since this all first happened to me,

56:59.041 --> 57:01.385
I've been fighting between suicide

57:01.501 --> 57:03.674
and trying to find some way
to do good with it.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.799
And now...

57:09.468 --> 57:11.061
maybe I've found a way to do both.

57:13.555 --> 57:16.274
Stay in your homes tonight
and lock your doors.

57:16.391 --> 57:17.734
I'll take care of this.

57:17.851 --> 57:20.070
- No, son.
Don't do it, he'll kill you.

57:20.187 --> 57:22.861
- Maybe.
- No! Cayden!

57:22.981 --> 57:24.824
I mean he'll kill you.

57:29.863 --> 57:32.036
- Maybe I can take him with me.

57:32.991 --> 57:34.083
- No!

57:34.201 --> 57:36.704
John, please, you gotta stop him.

57:37.663 --> 57:39.006
- How?

57:47.547 --> 57:50.721
- Look, Tollerman and the others
broke the pact.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.560
Brought the kid in from the outside.

57:52.678 --> 57:54.225
What are we gonna do about it?

57:55.263 --> 57:57.482
- The kid has to go.

57:57.599 --> 57:59.647
They're not gonna give him up
without a good fight.

57:59.768 --> 58:01.361
Tollerman won't allow it.

58:02.562 --> 58:06.612
So if he won't come to us,
then we'll have to go and take him.

58:07.442 --> 58:08.864
Yeah, okay.

58:10.404 --> 58:12.247
Or I could just come to you.

58:13.448 --> 58:15.701
- Wow!
- This is nice.

58:15.826 --> 58:20.206
I've never seen a wolf den like it. It's
like a camping trip for hairy lunatics.

58:21.957 --> 58:23.174
- Tell me something, kid,

58:23.291 --> 58:25.168
did the Synod send you up here?

58:25.293 --> 58:27.170
- What the fuck is a Synod?

58:27.295 --> 58:30.344
You really don't know shit, do you?

58:30.465 --> 58:31.465
- I know about Lucinda.

58:32.968 --> 58:36.017
I know you took her by force.
- Watch your mouth, boy.

58:36.138 --> 58:38.436
- Before you all try to kill me,

58:40.308 --> 58:42.811
I'm just here to tell you
something, Connor.

58:45.313 --> 58:47.736
Lucinda Wills was my mother.

58:50.944 --> 58:51.991
- What?

58:53.655 --> 58:57.410
That's not possible.
Lucinda died before she gave birth.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.286
- That's what Tollerman told you.

59:00.078 --> 59:04.458
Truth is, she committed suicide
a few days after I was born.

59:08.503 --> 59:09.595
- Is that right?

59:13.675 --> 59:16.554
I'm gonna give you
the same chance I give everyone.

59:16.678 --> 59:17.725
Run.

59:17.846 --> 59:19.063
- No.

59:19.639 --> 59:22.017
You can either leave this town alone
and let Angelina go...

59:23.810 --> 59:25.983
- Or?
- Or...

59:29.441 --> 59:31.535
You'll force me to stop you.

59:32.944 --> 59:35.538
- Okay, then. Kill him.

59:36.740 --> 59:37.866
- Come on, then!

59:44.581 --> 59:46.379
- Check that way.

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:25.293
- Okay then, who's next?

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:27.836
- I'm pretty sure it's you, kid.

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:52.190
- Oh, God, they're killing him!
- Angel! Angel!

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:54.526
You can't help him!

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:22.478
- Boy...

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.272
- Animal!

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:54.002
Shit.

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:46.229
<i>Cayden... It was Cayden.</i>

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.825
<i>- Wolves, just like you.
- Lucinda got pregnant.</i>

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.231
<i>She let you go.
Lucinda died before she gave birth.</i>

01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:54.775
<i>- She killed herself.
- He's</i> a <i>monster.</i>

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:57.016
<i>At least Angel survives.
Don't you get that?</i>

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.467
<i>Your own flesh and blood.</i>

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.242
<i>I'll give you the same chance
I give everyone.</i>

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.862
<i>- How do you think I got so pretty?</i>

01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:03.284
- <i>Run.</i>

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:07.785
Oh dear,
this doesn't look good.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:12.665
Losing your life force,
you can't even hold your true form.

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:18.966
- Wild Joe?

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.844
- Get up, you little fucker.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:30.641
Get up.
- Oh, I'm so...

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:31.891
- Get up!

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:33.564
Get up!

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.108
Get up!

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:41.409
Get... up...

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.140
- Oh my God!

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:13.563
John!

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.902
John!

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.718
- I was trying not to kill them.

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:46.682
- That was a mistake.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:50.012
It's life or death out here.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:54.391
- I... I need a hospital...

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:58.277
or a vet or something.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.321
- You don't need a hospital.

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:02.236
You need to change.

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:04.860
You have to get out and run.

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:06.736
- I can't. It's too painful.

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:10.081
- Trust us.
You have to change.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.750
If you don't, son,
you ain't gonna make it.

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.667
- Just try.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:34.852
- Jesus!

01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:40.650
I can't. I can't.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:42.022
Angel,

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:52.157
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:17.815
- Okay...

01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:23.780
- Okay, you need to run.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:26.776
- Angel, that's not gonna happen right now.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:30.737
- You have to, okay?
It's the only way.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.665
Trust me.

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:37.119
Go.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:39.830
It's okay, it's okay.

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:41.331
It's okay...

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.675
Feeling better?

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:29.171
- Much, yeah.

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:32.006
But what's it matter?

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.264
I can't beat them, there's way too many.

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.812
If I go back up there, they'll kill me.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.434
- You should go.
Save yourself.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:44.436
- You think I could do that?

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:46.738
No.

01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:50.154
I have to beat them.
All of them.

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:53.905
And I know there's got to be a way...
- I'm sorry I got you into all this shit.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:55.701
- What? Don't be.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:08:00.498
It's not your fault.
I got myself into all of this shit.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:05.965
Come on.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.850
- Whoa. What is that horrible stench?

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:17.890
- Excuse me, my dear,

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.264
that is my personal collection

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:25.519
of genuine, A-1, organic,
fully recycled ovine detritus.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:28.567
And it is extremely good for the soil.

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:32.649
- And extremely explosive, right?

Slashes, broken bones.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.773
- Get them up and running,
they'll feel better.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.529

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:17.662

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:21.541
If anything happens to you,
all of this was for nothing.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.578
- The rest of us don't heal like you do.
Like he does.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:27.921
That's if he survived the fall.

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.462
- Run home, pack your bags.

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:33.676
When all this is over, meet me at the motel
at the bottom of the hill.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.718
Then we'll leave.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:37.886
We'll be free.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:43.475

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:46.937

- Clara! Angel!

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.463
- Maybe someone noticed something
back in town.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.885
Maybe they'll send somebody for help.

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:45.556
- When they grabbed me,
I didn't see a single person left.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:50.686
It's like all the normal ones left town.
Like they knew.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.401
- She's right. They knew.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.950
- John Tollerman.
Ladies.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:03.161
Can't thank you enough
for coming to my big night.

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:05.530
- Well, it seems like
we couldn't stay away.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.874
- Yeah.
Tell me something, John.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.042
Where's the kid?

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:14.714
- The kid's dead.
We buried him where he fell.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:18.926
- I guess lies come easy
after 20 years of them, right?

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:20.090
- It's no lie.

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.760
He was your son and you killed him.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.132
- Bullshit, John.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:28.178
If he were my son, that would mean
you'd hidden Lucinda away from me

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:30.350
and lied to me for more than 20 years.

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:32.849
And you'd have to know
how you'd suffer for that.

01:12:33.808 --> 01:12:35.936
- You think I'm afraid of dying?

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.781
- It's not the dying, John,
it's what comes first.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:43.989
Uh-oh!

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:47.614
Oh, shit, it's the big moment.

01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:49.365
Oh, yeah!

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.210
Can you believe I'm a little bit nervous?

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:59.004
- You ought to be.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:01.378
- Okay, John.

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:06.765
Oh my God.
What have they done to her, John?

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.430
- She's been drugged.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.563
- Don't worry, Angel,
this'll all be over by midnight,

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.102
assuming you whelp me a boy.

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:19.900
Hey, I'm doing this for you, Angel.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:22.444
I'm doing this for all of us.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:26.278
- This sucks.

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:28.446
We're missing the whole party.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:32.326
- Hey, if Connor says
he'll show, he'll show.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:34.706
And then we kill him.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:39.587
And then we'll party.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.051
- Hmm? Did you hear that?

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:48.516
Connor!

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.055
- Friends, been a long time coming
this night,

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:56.604
and what a thing
to have my badass pack here to see it.

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.271
Connor!

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:00.360
- And I want to thank Angel here

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:02.438
for just making me
the happiest wolf in the woods.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:05.483
- Fuck you!
- Oh, shit!

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.612
- It's like we're mated already.

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:12.745
Well, best get on with it, eh?

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:16.002
- Connory Slaughter!
- Yes!

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:17.620
Alpha dog!

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:19.622
Leader of the fucking pack!

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:24.048
- Yeah!
- Do you take this bitch for...

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:26.504
well, tonight, basically?

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:29.178
- I do.
- Angelina Timmins!

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.551
Owner of the only bar in town, and...

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:35.225
Do you take...
- Uh, Deke, she does.

01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:39.691
Alright, well, uh...
it's the big moment.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:41.811
So if you'll excuse us,
you guys enjoy yourselves

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:45.657
and we'll be back in,
let's say, 20 minutes.

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:49.152
Oh, hell, make it 40.

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:53.535
Unless, of course,
anyone's got any objections.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.334
Doesn't count, Gail.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.202
Alright, then, let's do it.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:02.332
- I have an objection!
- Boy...

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.208
- Didn't I tell you?

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.256
Didn't I warn you
to leave these people alone?

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:09.927
- Well, they're my pack, boy.
They do what I tell them.

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.299
- This isn't a pack.

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:16.520
Wolves don't terrorize towns,
or kidnap innocents, or brutalize women.

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:18.514
You're barely wolves at all!

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:22.189
- Okay then, boys,
let's show him what we really are!

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:13.785
Hey!

01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:17.790
You traitorous fucking bitch!

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:19.784
- Deke, shut the fuck up!

01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:28.301
Go, John! Save him!
Wait!

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:32.129
- Ah...

01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:10.134
Okay, here we go.

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:21.388
- Listen to me, all of you!

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:28.027
You think you can kill me,
but you can't!

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:31.647
Turn back and survive!

01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:33.949
Stay...

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:37.870
and I'll kill you all.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:42.704
- Bring him to me.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.177
What in the hell?

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.683
Find him, Kino!
Bring me his fucking head!

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.098
- We've got to be smart about this!
We gotta...

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.876
- You can't hide from me, boy.

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:32.212
Go, John, now!

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.679
- Oh, my poor barn.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:54.025
- Holy shit...

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:56.239
- Hmm!

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:07.751
- This is my town, you little bastard!

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:11.168
- No! You chose the hills,
you keep to the hills!

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:30.441
You did this to me!

01:19:30.557 --> 01:19:32.559
You made me the monster I am!

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.737
- Not monster enough, apparently.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.237
I guess you really did have
some fight in you, kid.

01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:31.668
Come on!

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:58.821
- Goodbye, Connory Slaughter.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:02.236
No!

01:21:04.777 --> 01:21:05.778
Look at me.

01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:13.251
You've done... hideous things in your life.

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:15.834
And you deserve to die.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:39.774
- You're right.

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:47.321
But you should know,
I never took Lucinda by force.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:52.871
I loved her, and she loved me.

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:57.292
When her father found out
she was pregnant,

01:21:57.413 --> 01:21:59.165
he threatened to kill her.

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:02.751
So I took the fall for it.

01:22:06.713 --> 01:22:09.011
They took the woman that I loved
away from me.

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:12.303
And I just...

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:18.566
became the monster
they said I always was.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:24.152
So go on, Cayden.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:27.618
Just end it.

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:30.446
You earned it.

01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:40.297
- Oh, well, I tell you, boys...

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:43.501
being here to witness
this happy homecoming

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.878
warms the cockles of my heart.

01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:49.007
Makes all my trouble worthwhile!
Yahoo!

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:51.725
I knew it! Joe fucking Wills.

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:53.344
- All these years later,

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:56.769
hey, it's Connory Slaughter,

01:22:56.889 --> 01:22:59.017
beaten, on his knees.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.360
- I see that eye of yours never healed,
did it?

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:04.105
- No. Just the one-eye Jack
with the gimpy limp.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:07.115
So I'd never forget what you did to me.

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:08.232
Hmm?

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:12.906
You know what your old man told me
when he exiled me from this town?

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:16.580
He said that I was too wild, too brutal.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:19.499
I swore I'd come back and kill you.

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:21.914
He just laughed at me.

01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:24.212
Ha!

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.006
But the kid was the key.

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:29.050
You never knew he existed.
You never heard the stories.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:32.892
But my little brother, Carter,
he told me.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.102
He told me all about it.

01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.513
Maybe I couldn't hurt you,

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:39.599
but Chipper here...

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:42.731
he's going to break your fucking hide.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.946
- Hey Joe, why don't you just turn around
and crawl right out of town?

01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:49.609
- You think I went to all this trouble
tracking your offspring down,

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:53.203
bringing him here, killing his parents,
just to walk away?

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.947
Just to let you live?

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.116
- You did what?

01:23:57.991 --> 01:23:59.083
- What?

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:02.208
Oh, yeah.

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:03.751
I killed your folks

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:06.500
and I kind of made the cops
think it was you.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:08.047
Why?!

01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:09.168
- Why?

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:12.344
To get you to grow up!
To bring you here!

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:16.435
To put him in this exact situation!

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:18.805
- You son of a bitch!

01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:21.724
- Aw, forget it.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:24.605
You're too beat up to fight me now.
I mean, the both of you.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:27.980
I could beat you with one hand
tied behind my back.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:33.656
This is my day!

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:38.532
Oh, baby, I've earned it.

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:40.125
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah?

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:42.711
- You know your brother, Carter?
- He's my baby.

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:45.172
- I had him for dinner two days ago.

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:13.029
Aw, sweet dreams, Connor.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.737
- I'll kill you, Joe!

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:22.200
- Kill me?

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:27.710
You're my trained dog, boy.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:33.546
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:41.103
- You were never too wild
for this town, Joe.

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.396
Just too crazy.

01:25:43.513 --> 01:25:44.810
Aw, damn.

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:13.006
- Help me, kid.

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:14.627
Huh?

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:17.388
No?

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:18.506
Ah...

01:26:19.049 --> 01:26:20.266
Aw!

01:26:20.384 --> 01:26:21.761
Ever been shot in the shoulder?

01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:25.644
It's like getting kicked in the shin,
but it's the shoulder.

01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:33.277
So, are you gonna kill me now, too, huh?

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:38.319
Before you do, I'll give you
an interesting little tidbit.

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:43.207
Wolves, real wolves,

01:26:43.323 --> 01:26:46.748
they only kill for food or defence.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:49.291
- Well, I'm not a wolf, Joe.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:56.420
I'm a human being.
- That's my point, son.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:27:00.015
They're calling you a murderer,
a cold-blooded killer.

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.634
It's not true.
It's not what you are.

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:03.135
- I've killed tonight.

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:06.513
Because of you.
- No, kid.

01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:15.527
Because you had to.
It was Connor.

01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:17.365
It's always been Connor.

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:20.152
He made us this way.

01:27:20.277 --> 01:27:22.120
He did it to all of us.

01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:26.993
- Well, Connor's dead now, Joe.
- That's right.

01:27:27.117 --> 01:27:29.791
I killed the monster that made you, boy.

01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:33.294
And so, we're all paid up.

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.008
We're even.

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:38.170
- Even?
- Yeah.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.592
- Is that what we are?

01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:50.057
You know, I guess it's true.

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:56.363
I never have killed anyone in cold blood.

01:27:57.856 --> 01:28:00.575
But, life is...

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:07.207
complicated.

01:28:12.746 --> 01:28:15.670
And you ate my fucking parents.

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:19.507
- Alright, boy!

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:20.675
Come on!

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:23.098
Show me what you got!

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:25.217
- What I've got, Joe?
- Yeah!

01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:29.934
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:37.733
- Fuck.

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:28.827
- Hey-
- Hey-

01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:45.973
- There. That should fertilize
the soy beans.

01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:49.309
And no one need ever know.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:53.347
So who's up for some breakfast?
- John, I gotta go.

01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:57.813
- So soon?

01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:01.321
Well, you, uh...

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:06.110
you got a home here now, you know.

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:08.407
- No, I... I know, and we'll be back.
It's just...

01:30:08.528 --> 01:30:10.121
- It's me, John.

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.115
I need to get away from here.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.663
For a while, anyway.
- Who's gonna run the bar?

01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:16.127
- Gail.

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:17.416
- Hmm!

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:19.501
- Maybe you could check on her
every now and again?

01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:20.623
- Yeah, of course.

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:26.843
Well, you've got something
you'd better take with you, then.

01:30:27.797 --> 01:30:29.549
Now, this...

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:31.426
this is a very rare piece.

01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:36.022
It, uh... it traces all the old lines
all the way back.

01:30:36.139 --> 01:30:37.982
So you keep it safe.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.781
- So many.
- Yeah...

01:30:47.734 --> 01:30:50.283
- John, I can't take this from you.
This is...

01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:51.620
- Oh, you keep that with you.

01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:55.326
That'll come in handy.
Wherever you go, you look for those names.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.452
It'll give you a heads up.

01:31:00.497 --> 01:31:02.170
- Well, thank you, Clara.

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:05.844
- Take care.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:11.762
- Yeah.

01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:16.268
- Thanks for everything, Uncle John.
- Yeah.

01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:56.929
