00:41.726 --> 00:43.360
Captain.

00:46.798 --> 00:48.198
Captain.

00:57.842 --> 00:59.835
Thanks, Captain.

02:15.820 --> 02:16.979
Captain.

02:17.021 --> 02:18.355
Hold on.

02:18.923 --> 02:20.983
Hold on, hold on.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.961
Right, bring him to.
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up.

02:32.003 --> 02:33.696
All right, all right.
Bring him over here.

02:33.738 --> 02:35.564
Come on, line him up,
line him up, line him up.

02:35.606 --> 02:37.909
One, two, three, come on.
Bring him over.

02:39.043 --> 02:40.670
Hello, sir.
My name is Dr. Cummins.

02:40.712 --> 02:42.638
I'm going to be
taking care of you.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.472
Four for a boy...

02:44.514 --> 02:46.942
Okay, we have three shots
in the abdomen.

02:46.984 --> 02:49.519
Five for a wedding,
six for a birth...

02:50.520 --> 02:51.747
- What's he saying?
- Six for a birth.

02:51.789 --> 02:52.957
Sounds like a nursery rhyme.

02:54.726 --> 02:56.786
I'm gonna have to go in
and get these.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.228
Hold him down.

02:58.796 --> 03:00.523
Okay, here we go.

03:08.072 --> 03:09.598
One.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.634
Going in for the second.

03:11.676 --> 03:13.636
- Stay with me.
- Five for a wedding.

03:13.678 --> 03:16.337
- Five for a wedding.
- Two.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.309
Uh, uh, it's shattered.

03:21.351 --> 03:23.311
I'm gonna have to go in
a second time.

03:23.353 --> 03:25.715
- Okay, last one.
- Five for a wedding...

03:25.757 --> 03:28.325
Wait a minute,
there's something else in here.

03:28.760 --> 03:29.919
Okay, here it comes.

03:34.966 --> 03:36.926
Okay.

03:40.772 --> 03:41.997
That's not a German bullet.

03:42.039 --> 03:43.733
Eight for silver.

04:25.082 --> 04:26.542
How is he?

04:26.584 --> 04:28.511
Not so good, ma'am.

04:55.412 --> 04:56.839
Charlotte!

04:56.881 --> 04:58.473
I have your book.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.117
Edward, that's my book.
Give it back.

05:01.886 --> 05:04.513
- Give it back!
- Edward, stop this at once!

05:04.555 --> 05:06.048
Charlotte.

05:06.090 --> 05:07.692
Please.

05:09.927 --> 05:12.429
You must stop teasing
your sister.

05:15.867 --> 05:17.526
Delicious.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.460
Thank you.

05:19.502 --> 05:22.965
Anais, would you mind
preparing me some hot water?

05:23.007 --> 05:25.442
- I'd like to take a bath.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.193
Hey, you two
better knock it off!

08:56.387 --> 08:59.715
- It's the elders.
- Let's go down and listen.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.261
Yes, we need to find
a solution.

09:12.303 --> 09:14.997
In the last three weeks,
more have joined them.

09:15.039 --> 09:16.765
And do we know
where they are?

09:16.807 --> 09:18.867
They are camped
between Wood Field

09:18.909 --> 09:20.402
and Dei's Rock.

09:20.444 --> 09:23.280
They claim the land
belongs to them.

09:25.749 --> 09:27.976
Has anyone looked into
the validity of this claim?

09:28.018 --> 09:31.113
There does seem to be
some validity to the claim

09:31.155 --> 09:33.215
that dates back 80 years,

09:33.257 --> 09:34.817
but there is nothing
on record

09:34.859 --> 09:37.061
that can't be changed
in our favor.

09:39.430 --> 09:41.690
Has anyone tried
to negotiate with them?

09:41.732 --> 09:45.260
They're Gypsies, Seamus.

09:45.302 --> 09:47.296
They're laying claim
to a sizeable amount

09:47.338 --> 09:49.364
of our shared lands

09:49.406 --> 09:52.343
and we've made them
an offer to walk away.

09:52.776 --> 09:54.703
The offer was substantial.

09:54.745 --> 09:57.648
They want the land.

10:00.351 --> 10:02.186
That can't be allowed
to happen.

10:03.220 --> 10:07.282
We all have something
to lose in this room,

10:07.324 --> 10:11.095
so what I'm suggesting
stays in this room.

10:11.462 --> 10:14.156
Charlotte, Edward, off you go.
Off you go. Go, go.

10:14.198 --> 10:18.460
The money that was offered
is used to hire mercenaries

10:18.502 --> 10:21.105
to remove them
from the land.

10:21.438 --> 10:23.365
In my experience,

10:23.407 --> 10:27.211
the threat of the stick
is normally enough.

12:07.544 --> 12:09.838
This land is not yours.

12:12.449 --> 12:15.911
You're being told
this land is not yours!

12:15.953 --> 12:18.581
Gather your people,
get off the land!

13:36.467 --> 13:37.627
Here we go.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.599
Let's take another one.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.248
Caught these two
trying to escape.

13:52.149 --> 13:53.909
Woman had these.

13:53.951 --> 13:55.977
Old whore tried
to fucking bite me with them.

13:56.019 --> 13:57.979
- And did she?
- Nah.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.588
You think you can just
waltz into my country

14:05.630 --> 14:07.456
with your spells and magic

14:07.498 --> 14:09.400
and take whatever land
you fancy?

14:16.674 --> 14:18.142
Make an example of them.

14:18.542 --> 14:22.179
A warning. His kind
aren't welcome 'round here.

14:22.980 --> 14:25.608
Make sure you bury these
with her.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.209
You sure?

14:27.251 --> 14:29.520
Silver.
Worth a pretty penny.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.223
There's no worth in it.
Just death.

14:41.331 --> 14:42.533
Get 'em outta my sight!

14:43.400 --> 14:44.694
Come on!

14:48.673 --> 14:49.406
Put him there.

14:50.708 --> 14:53.510
Now, let's get you
in a nice coat.

14:58.015 --> 15:00.050
Yeah, put that on.

15:02.453 --> 15:03.353
There we go.

15:05.557 --> 15:08.417
We don't want you
getting cold, do we?

15:08.459 --> 15:10.318
You're gonna be out here
a while.

15:19.771 --> 15:23.231
Now, this'll teach you

15:23.273 --> 15:27.177
to run your filthy Gypsy mouth
to my captain.

15:27.645 --> 15:29.614
Let's get this on you.

16:07.251 --> 16:10.045
Come on! Dirt soon enough.

16:13.323 --> 16:15.183
Shut it.

16:23.635 --> 16:27.663
♪ Come over the hills ♪

16:27.705 --> 16:31.433
♪ My bonnie Irish lass ♪

16:31.475 --> 16:38.741
♪ Come over the hills
to your darling ♪

16:38.783 --> 16:42.277
♪ You choose the road, love, ♪

16:42.319 --> 16:45.657
♪ and I'll make the vow ♪

16:46.290 --> 16:53.196
♪ And I'll be
your true love forever ♪♪

16:53.798 --> 16:55.399
Very nice.

16:55.833 --> 16:57.593
Now time for bed.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.710
I'd like a room
for the night.

18:13.578 --> 18:14.912
All guests must
sign in here.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.574
State where you've been,
where you're going,

18:18.616 --> 18:19.809
and state your business.

18:19.851 --> 18:21.284
Town rules.

18:27.625 --> 18:31.161
Any reports of Gypsies
in the area?

18:31.963 --> 18:35.399
Like I said,
state your business here.

18:36.266 --> 18:38.426
Other than that,
food and ale are included

18:38.468 --> 18:39.804
with the room.

18:40.972 --> 18:43.841
Take a seat,
I'll bring you some food.

19:19.711 --> 19:21.503
That didn't take very long.

19:21.545 --> 19:23.246
What gave me away?

19:23.681 --> 19:25.641
Other than the fact
you're asking about Gypsies

19:25.683 --> 19:27.643
and you stated
your profession as pathologist

19:27.685 --> 19:29.377
in the guest book,

19:29.419 --> 19:30.822
not much.

19:31.656 --> 19:34.249
Doesn't the good constable
have matters to attend to?

19:34.291 --> 19:35.885
It's lieutenant.

19:35.927 --> 19:38.295
Oh, climbing
the promotion ladder.

19:38.629 --> 19:39.864
I'm impressed.

19:41.966 --> 19:44.468
I heard what happened
in Gévaudan.

19:44.736 --> 19:45.703
I'm sorry.

19:46.336 --> 19:47.705
How have you been?

19:54.011 --> 19:56.337
How long will you
be staying?

19:56.379 --> 19:58.841
We could use
a good pathologist 'round here.

19:58.883 --> 20:01.276
Cholera got the last one.

20:01.318 --> 20:03.913
Well, if cholera's the only
thing you have to police,

20:03.955 --> 20:06.724
then you don't need
a pathologist, do you?

21:35.079 --> 21:36.614
Edward!

21:36.881 --> 21:38.506
- Edward!
- Edward!

21:39.851 --> 21:40.651
Edward!

21:41.819 --> 21:43.979
Edward, come inside.
Cover yourself!

21:51.729 --> 21:53.388
What happened?

22:01.438 --> 22:04.934
Four for a boy. Five for a
wedding, six for a birth.

22:04.976 --> 22:07.536
Seven for a curse
that's buried in the Earth.

22:07.578 --> 22:09.538
Eight for silver,
nine for gold.

22:09.580 --> 22:11.974
Ten for a wolf
and you won't die old.

22:12.016 --> 22:13.075
Come on, Timmy,
it's your go.

22:18.789 --> 22:20.625
One for sorrow,
two for joy,

22:20.992 --> 22:22.593
three for a girl,
four for a boy.

22:23.127 --> 22:25.420
Five for a wedding,
six for a birth.

22:25.462 --> 22:27.131
Seven for a curse
that's buried in the Earth.

22:27.965 --> 22:29.100
I've seen it.

22:29.734 --> 22:31.068
Seen what?

22:36.140 --> 22:38.901
Before we go any further, you
must swear not to tell anyone.

22:40.945 --> 22:42.872
I mean it, your father
will banish my family

22:42.914 --> 22:44.874
from the settlement
if he finds out.

22:47.218 --> 22:48.677
- I swear.
- We swear.

23:16.047 --> 23:17.706
We're not supposed
to be here.

23:17.748 --> 23:20.242
- The elders forbid it.
- They have forbid it

23:20.284 --> 23:22.678
ever since the night
this field was on fire.

23:24.288 --> 23:25.556
But since then...

23:26.624 --> 23:29.051
how many of you have dreamt
about the scarecrow

23:29.093 --> 23:30.886
and the silver teeth?

23:41.639 --> 23:43.699
Let's dig up
the box of treasure.

23:45.743 --> 23:47.202
- You're scared.
- Am not!

23:47.244 --> 23:48.545
Yes, you are.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.941
- Scaredy-cat.
- Leave him alone.

23:54.185 --> 23:55.720
Are you gonna
dig it up?

23:57.154 --> 23:58.948
If you're so brave,
why don't you dig it up?

24:02.226 --> 24:03.953
All right.

24:03.995 --> 24:05.721
- I will.
- No, Timmy, don't.

24:14.271 --> 24:15.297
Timmy.

24:18.809 --> 24:20.235
Timmy, don't.

24:33.357 --> 24:35.718
Don't touch him, Eddie!

24:51.208 --> 24:53.769
Run, Charlotte, run!

24:53.811 --> 24:55.637
Get out of here, run!

25:14.198 --> 25:16.692
Help!

25:24.975 --> 25:28.771
Charlotte!

25:28.813 --> 25:30.806
Charlotte,
what's the matter?

25:30.848 --> 25:32.641
What is it?
What's happened?

25:34.752 --> 25:36.320
Fetch the doctor.

25:42.293 --> 25:44.361
What's happened?
What happened to him?

25:46.330 --> 25:48.799
Darling,
just be brave, dear.

25:50.267 --> 25:51.360
Here.

26:11.088 --> 26:12.881
It's very dark in here.

26:12.923 --> 26:15.826
Yes, the light,
it was hurting his eyes.

26:16.327 --> 26:17.394
Right.

26:18.729 --> 26:21.298
Let's have a look,
shall we?

26:22.133 --> 26:25.069
Mm-hm.

26:30.074 --> 26:33.702
Edward has been bitten
by some kind of wild animal.

26:33.744 --> 26:35.704
The wound does seem
to be infected

26:35.746 --> 26:37.106
and he has a fever.

26:37.148 --> 26:38.407
I've treated the wound

26:38.449 --> 26:40.309
and given him
something to, uh,

26:40.351 --> 26:41.952
calm him down.

26:42.987 --> 26:45.914
I shall come back in a day
or two and check on him.

26:45.956 --> 26:47.082
Thank you.

26:47.124 --> 26:48.392
This way.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.028
Thank you, Doctor.

27:34.171 --> 27:35.339
Run!

28:18.983 --> 28:20.442
Edward?

28:30.527 --> 28:32.087
Edward?

28:35.933 --> 28:37.059
Eddie?

28:54.184 --> 28:55.444
It's Edward.

28:55.486 --> 28:57.179
There's something wrong
with him.

28:57.221 --> 28:58.548
Stay here.

29:14.238 --> 29:15.964
Edward?

29:17.875 --> 29:19.368
Edward?

29:21.178 --> 29:22.079
Edward!

29:37.361 --> 29:39.087
Edward!

29:44.134 --> 29:45.595
Edward!

29:52.577 --> 29:53.935
Edward!

30:38.255 --> 30:39.490
Molière.

30:40.692 --> 30:43.653
Come to boast about
another promotion, have you?

30:43.695 --> 30:46.355
There's a manor house
half a day's ride from here.

30:46.397 --> 30:47.923
They've sent for me
regarding their son

30:47.965 --> 30:49.559
who's gone missing.

30:49.601 --> 30:51.561
And what's that
to do with me?

30:51.603 --> 30:54.963
There was a Gypsy problem
that way not so long ago.

30:55.005 --> 30:58.233
It may be connected
to what you've been looking for.

31:21.031 --> 31:22.232
Psst!

31:42.754 --> 31:46.457
Timmy?

31:47.024 --> 31:48.992
What happened to Edward
in the field?

31:50.027 --> 31:51.596
You don't remember?

31:52.329 --> 31:54.222
What I remember
was the silver teeth

31:54.264 --> 31:56.467
and then a nightmare,
and then...

31:57.769 --> 31:59.729
and then,
I woke up on the ground.

32:02.172 --> 32:04.332
You used the teeth
to bite Edward.

32:08.613 --> 32:10.706
Did you and the others
tell them what happened?

32:13.083 --> 32:14.284
No.

32:15.319 --> 32:17.279
We took an oath,
remember?

32:21.593 --> 32:23.318
"And Judas asked,

32:23.360 --> 32:25.353
'What are you willing
to give me

32:25.395 --> 32:27.599
if I deliver him
over to you?'

32:28.733 --> 32:30.434
And they counted out
for him

32:31.101 --> 32:35.798
30 pieces of silver."

32:42.312 --> 32:45.182
It is the same silver
that was given to Judas.

32:50.387 --> 32:52.247
Take this,
you may need it.

32:58.696 --> 33:00.197
Where's the silver?

33:01.164 --> 33:02.491
It's here.

33:05.202 --> 33:07.429
On holy ground.

33:11.174 --> 33:12.777
I saw the flames
in my nightmare.

33:14.646 --> 33:18.641
We will all pay for the sins
made by our elders.

33:24.288 --> 33:25.781
We're all going to die.

33:42.707 --> 33:45.735
Charlotte!
What did Timmy want?

33:48.211 --> 33:49.539
Come.

34:01.559 --> 34:02.618
Edward!

34:05.763 --> 34:07.289
Edward!

35:31.616 --> 35:33.383
Good day, sirs.

35:33.885 --> 35:36.319
Please, follow me.

35:50.001 --> 35:52.804
Mr. Laurent will be
with you shortly.

36:03.781 --> 36:06.408
Gentlemen.
Seamus Laurent.

36:06.450 --> 36:08.309
Lieutenant Alfred Molière.

36:08.351 --> 36:10.988
- This is the pathologist.
- John McBride.

36:11.789 --> 36:13.616
We have prepared
guest rooms for you

36:13.658 --> 36:14.884
in case you need to stay.

36:14.926 --> 36:16.719
Mr. Laurent,
you sent for us

36:16.761 --> 36:18.721
about an urgent matter
regarding the disappearance

36:18.763 --> 36:19.922
of your son.

36:19.964 --> 36:21.322
Yes.

36:21.364 --> 36:22.658
But since
we sent for you,

36:22.700 --> 36:24.560
things have gotten
a lot worse.

37:04.041 --> 37:05.534
Jesus.

38:04.467 --> 38:08.063
Cause of death is consistent
with attack by a wild animal.

38:08.105 --> 38:09.832
A wild animal?

38:09.874 --> 38:11.700
Size and shape
of the bite marks

38:11.742 --> 38:13.510
suggest a wolf.

38:14.579 --> 38:16.080
Who is he?

38:16.848 --> 38:18.040
The Adams boy.

38:18.082 --> 38:20.350
And your son
is still missing?

38:20.818 --> 38:21.944
Yes.

38:21.986 --> 38:24.146
Well. That's that.

38:24.188 --> 38:26.615
I'll head back to the department
and file a report.

38:26.657 --> 38:27.992
Is that it?

38:28.491 --> 38:30.085
You have an attack
by a wild animal.

38:30.127 --> 38:31.620
Your boy's missing.

38:31.662 --> 38:33.564
I don't mean
to be insensitive,

38:33.798 --> 38:36.125
but the country's in the middle
of a cholera pandemic.

38:36.167 --> 38:37.902
Thousands are dead.

38:39.003 --> 38:40.771
Many towns are
closing their gates.

38:42.173 --> 38:44.700
Trade routes heavily affected.

38:44.742 --> 38:46.043
I'm sorry.

38:46.811 --> 38:48.746
There's nothin' more
I can do.

38:49.213 --> 38:51.040
No, I'd like to stay on
for a few days,

38:51.082 --> 38:52.116
if that's all right.

38:59.522 --> 39:01.959
Let me know
if your boy shows up.

39:17.174 --> 39:19.034
So you knew the boy.

39:19.076 --> 39:21.203
My son Edward
and my daughter Charlotte

39:21.245 --> 39:23.748
often play with the children
from the settlement.

39:25.182 --> 39:27.643
And on the day
Edward went missing,

39:27.685 --> 39:29.120
what do you remember?

39:29.720 --> 39:31.479
A group of them
had been in the woods

39:31.521 --> 39:33.057
with the Adams boy.

39:34.524 --> 39:37.628
Something had happened
and Edward had been hurt.

39:38.229 --> 39:40.122
And by the time we got him
back to the house,

39:40.164 --> 39:42.524
he had developed
a terrible fever.

39:42.566 --> 39:43.801
Mm.

39:45.202 --> 39:47.537
Something had attacked Edward
in the woods.

39:48.538 --> 39:49.774
An animal.

39:51.175 --> 39:58.115
He, uh... he had bite marks
on his, um...

40:00.151 --> 40:03.486
Yes, they had to have come
from an animal.

40:05.056 --> 40:08.693
Charlotte seemed to be in shock.
She couldn't tell us anything.

40:10.161 --> 40:12.187
Later that evening,
I went to check on him

40:12.229 --> 40:14.657
but his bed was empty
and he was nowhere to be found

40:14.699 --> 40:15.532
in the house.

40:18.169 --> 40:19.971
We haven't seen him since.

40:20.604 --> 40:22.698
A few days later,
the body of the Adams boy

40:22.740 --> 40:24.241
was found in the woods.

40:25.142 --> 40:28.112
Mr. McBride, the families in
the settlement are frightened.

40:28.713 --> 40:30.539
They are in my employ,
they live on my land,

40:30.581 --> 40:32.149
and I am responsible
for them.

40:32.850 --> 40:34.986
They're looking to me
to resolve this.

40:40.291 --> 40:43.519
May I present
my wife, Isabelle.

40:43.561 --> 40:45.120
This is Mr. John McBride.

40:45.162 --> 40:46.897
Very pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Laurent.

40:47.698 --> 40:50.500
I'm so sorry to hear
your Edward is missing.

40:52.236 --> 40:53.595
Is it possible

40:53.637 --> 40:55.597
- he's just run away?
- No.

40:55.639 --> 40:57.232
That wouldn't be
like Edward.

40:57.274 --> 41:00.011
You see,
he is a very happy child.

41:01.212 --> 41:03.172
Besides,
we have searched everywhere.

41:03.214 --> 41:05.207
And we are still
looking for him.

41:05.249 --> 41:06.751
Please help us find him.

41:07.284 --> 41:10.546
Why, yes... uh,
may I see his room?

41:10.588 --> 41:11.722
Of course.

41:30.041 --> 41:32.176
We had to clean
the sheets.

41:33.210 --> 41:35.312
Edward, he was, um...

41:36.647 --> 41:38.082
he was unwell.

41:39.917 --> 41:41.719
May I see
the rest of the house?

41:43.154 --> 41:44.713
Of course.

41:56.767 --> 41:58.569
When I came down,

41:58.903 --> 42:00.829
this door was wide open.

42:42.113 --> 42:44.406
We need to board all the windows
on the ground floor shut.

42:44.448 --> 42:45.816
Why?

42:46.684 --> 42:48.377
It's just a precaution.

43:05.002 --> 43:12.167
♪ Come over the hills,
my bonnie Irish lass ♪

43:12.209 --> 43:19.675
♪ Come over the hills
to your darling ♪

43:19.717 --> 43:25.380
♪ You choose the road, love,
and I'll... ♪♪

43:29.426 --> 43:30.953
Anais.

43:33.030 --> 43:34.389
Charlotte.

45:30.481 --> 45:31.915
John?

47:18.656 --> 47:20.090
Are we going to die?

47:22.259 --> 47:24.294
Of course not!

47:25.496 --> 47:27.989
I will not stand
for such talk at the table.

47:28.031 --> 47:30.959
Mr. McBride is here
to help us find Edward,

47:31.001 --> 47:34.664
and we can help him
by maintaining our strength

47:34.706 --> 47:36.473
and remaining steadfast.

47:38.008 --> 47:39.635
Now, eat, please.

48:33.397 --> 48:34.724
Hm.

49:58.382 --> 49:59.483
McBride?

49:59.817 --> 50:01.343
Seamus, fetch a rifle.

50:28.913 --> 50:31.807
What kind of animal
tries to break into houses?

50:33.818 --> 50:35.778
There are some things
I'm going to need from you.

50:38.355 --> 50:40.315
What's happening here?

50:40.357 --> 50:42.785
Can't be sure until I set up
a hunting ground.

50:42.827 --> 50:44.528
You're gonna hunt it?

50:44.862 --> 50:46.163
Mm.

50:49.867 --> 50:52.402
I'll need to gather the elders
and tell them of your plans.

50:53.370 --> 50:55.898
We own all the land
in this region.

50:58.442 --> 51:00.770
Make sure they travel
under armed guard.

51:12.924 --> 51:15.518
Gentlemen, you're all aware
of the unfortunate circumstances

51:15.560 --> 51:17.795
that have brought us here
this evening,

51:18.395 --> 51:19.889
the killing
of the local child

51:19.931 --> 51:22.634
and the disappearance
of my own son, Edward.

51:23.801 --> 51:25.928
Mr. John McBride
has kindly offered

51:25.970 --> 51:28.505
to help capture the animal
that killed the Adams boy.

51:29.473 --> 51:31.834
You are sure that this is
some kind of animal,

51:31.876 --> 51:33.310
not the work of a madman?

51:34.378 --> 51:35.738
After examining the body,

51:35.780 --> 51:37.540
I concluded
that the cause of death

51:37.582 --> 51:40.384
had been consistent
with an animal bite.

51:41.218 --> 51:43.788
What kind of an animal
are we talking about?

51:45.322 --> 51:46.356
Wolf.

51:48.392 --> 51:50.662
You're a pathologist.

51:51.528 --> 51:52.722
That's correct.

51:52.764 --> 51:54.899
What does that mean,
exactly?

51:55.667 --> 51:57.827
Our body speaks
even after our death.

51:57.869 --> 51:58.502
I listen.

52:00.638 --> 52:02.798
Isn't it a job
for hunters?

52:02.840 --> 52:05.635
I'm sure we've all read about
the Beast of Gévaudan,

52:05.677 --> 52:07.435
perhaps heard the stories.

52:07.477 --> 52:08.838
You see,
I was stationed there

52:08.880 --> 52:10.840
during the troubles
with the army.

52:10.882 --> 52:13.308
You think what happened
in Gévaudan is happening here?

52:13.350 --> 52:15.711
It might very well be.

52:15.753 --> 52:18.681
Then, isn't this a job
for the army?

52:18.723 --> 52:20.916
Unfortunately,
the army can... will...

52:20.958 --> 52:22.918
only be deployed
if there is confirmation

52:22.960 --> 52:25.563
that the same thing is happening
here as in Gévaudan.

52:27.464 --> 52:30.358
Are you suggesting
that we stay inside our house

52:30.400 --> 52:32.227
and board the windows shut?

52:32.269 --> 52:34.429
I would strongly advise it.

52:57.327 --> 52:58.988
No one should be
out in the field

52:59.030 --> 53:00.790
until that madman is caught.

53:00.832 --> 53:01.991
There's no use
complaining.

53:02.033 --> 53:03.926
We drew the short straws.

53:03.968 --> 53:06.461
We get this done,
we get ourselves home,

53:06.503 --> 53:08.296
all right?

53:08.338 --> 53:10.298
Jakob,
you take the far side.

53:10.340 --> 53:12.275
We'll work inwards
till we meet in the middle.

53:13.945 --> 53:17.247
Keep your eyes peeled.
Stay in sight.

53:17.849 --> 53:19.474
All right?

53:55.720 --> 53:57.445
Calum?

54:15.606 --> 54:16.832
Calum!

54:20.410 --> 54:21.913
Calum!

54:37.695 --> 54:39.454
Jakob?

54:42.967 --> 54:44.627
Jakob?

54:48.606 --> 54:50.132
Jakob?

54:57.782 --> 54:59.141
Jakob?

55:17.735 --> 55:18.961
Jakob?

55:34.886 --> 55:36.879
Jakob?

55:57.507 --> 55:58.601
Run!

56:06.884 --> 56:08.611
Help!

56:08.653 --> 56:10.179
Somebody help!

56:14.659 --> 56:15.951
Help!

56:27.138 --> 56:28.639
This is all we found.

56:30.207 --> 56:33.936
Anne-Marie was working
the fields with Calum and Jakob.

56:33.978 --> 56:36.572
She made it back to the
settlement and raised the alarm.

56:36.614 --> 56:38.749
We came back here
and...

56:39.250 --> 56:41.677
no Calum and no Jakob.

56:41.719 --> 56:43.078
Did the girl see
what attacked them?

56:43.120 --> 56:46.115
Well... she's in shock.

56:46.157 --> 56:47.816
What... what she says
makes no sense.

56:47.858 --> 56:49.526
What did she say?

56:49.860 --> 56:51.996
She said it was a dragon.

56:52.930 --> 56:55.257
She's in a bad way,
she... she's lost a lot of blood.

56:55.299 --> 56:56.901
She was bitten?

56:58.602 --> 57:00.195
Where is she?

57:16.120 --> 57:17.588
She... she was just here.

57:21.692 --> 57:23.552
Everyone must leave.

57:23.594 --> 57:25.921
We can't protect them
in the field or in the village.

57:25.963 --> 57:27.756
It's no longer safe here.

57:27.798 --> 57:29.892
- And go where?
- Take them to the church,

57:29.934 --> 57:31.260
barricade the door shut.

57:31.302 --> 57:33.162
Food and water
can be fetched for,

57:33.204 --> 57:35.631
but under armed escort only.

57:35.673 --> 57:37.933
It is imperative
that we limit this exposure.

57:37.975 --> 57:39.243
Exposure?

57:40.077 --> 57:41.879
- Exposure to what?
- Seamus,

57:42.113 --> 57:44.648
you and your people
are being hunted.

57:45.816 --> 57:47.109
Water, I need water.

59:22.913 --> 59:24.406
Sorry.

59:24.448 --> 59:25.407
Oh.

59:25.449 --> 59:27.218
Can't sleep.

59:28.919 --> 59:30.846
Oh, me neither.

59:30.888 --> 59:31.822
Drink?

59:35.926 --> 59:36.994
Yes.

59:49.006 --> 59:50.074
Who's Edith?

59:51.976 --> 59:53.277
My wife.

59:54.845 --> 59:56.714
Do you have children?

01:00:03.154 --> 01:00:05.089
Seems a long time ago now.

01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:07.892
Are they no longer
with you?

01:00:12.163 --> 01:00:14.331
We'd been stationed
to Gévaudan.

01:00:16.066 --> 01:00:19.170
They were plagued
by a wolf.

01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:24.366
Two people had been killed
in the first week,

01:00:24.408 --> 01:00:26.443
six the following.

01:00:27.745 --> 01:00:29.747
That's when the army
had been drafted in.

01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:36.253
There was talk
that the wolf was a curse,

01:00:37.321 --> 01:00:39.356
and if people need to know.

01:00:42.459 --> 01:00:44.762
The first time I saw it,

01:00:45.362 --> 01:00:47.932
it was covered
in fresh blood,

01:00:48.399 --> 01:00:50.401
just outside our village.

01:00:51.235 --> 01:00:54.939
By the time I got back there,
it was... too late.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.210
Thirteen people
had been killed by the beast.

01:01:00.344 --> 01:01:02.913
My wife and daughter
were among them.

01:01:10.555 --> 01:01:12.489
I'm so sorry.

01:01:25.502 --> 01:01:28.205
Did they ever catch
this wolf?

01:01:31.242 --> 01:01:33.368
Shortly after that,

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:36.413
a band of traveling gypsies
came to Gévaudan.

01:01:37.414 --> 01:01:40.142
They said the curse
had had its revenge

01:01:40.184 --> 01:01:43.254
and was to be contained
in gypsy silver.

01:01:44.154 --> 01:01:45.548
They then traveled northwest,

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:48.025
but the trail went cold
in Le Malzieu.

01:01:49.226 --> 01:01:52.329
Well, the gypsies had a claim
on my husband's land.

01:01:52.863 --> 01:01:54.456
My husband and the elders...

01:01:54.498 --> 01:01:55.399
That's enough!

01:02:01.573 --> 01:02:03.073
That's enough.

01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:06.076
I want no more talk
of curses.

01:02:07.011 --> 01:02:08.279
We've locked everybody
in a church,

01:02:08.479 --> 01:02:10.372
and I have nobody
working the fields.

01:02:10.414 --> 01:02:12.983
If you're here to help,
then please help.

01:02:14.586 --> 01:02:17.045
I just want this beast
or this wolf or whatever it is

01:02:17.087 --> 01:02:18.981
captured and killed.

01:02:19.023 --> 01:02:21.258
Tomorrow
I will set the traps.

01:07:53.523 --> 01:07:55.893
What in God's name is it?

01:08:02.834 --> 01:08:05.360
Gentlemen,
I must warn you,

01:08:05.402 --> 01:08:07.162
this won't be easy.

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:52.240
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

01:09:06.898 --> 01:09:08.758
- It's Anne-Marie.
- Don't touch it!

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.801
She's gone.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:11.993
They never come back
the same.

01:09:16.774 --> 01:09:19.711
It's the kindest thing
we can do for her now, Saul.

01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:22.904
I've known her
since she was a baby.

01:09:22.947 --> 01:09:24.506
Saul.

01:09:26.483 --> 01:09:28.743
Saul!

01:09:30.854 --> 01:09:31.823
- Saul!
- Saul!

01:09:34.024 --> 01:09:35.718
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.852
Saul!

01:09:38.528 --> 01:09:40.622
Saul, shoot her!

01:09:40.665 --> 01:09:41.657
Do it now!

01:09:57.547 --> 01:10:00.350
Is this a fate
that has befallen my son?

01:10:06.624 --> 01:10:09.618
Isabelle must never know
about this, I beg you.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:12.362
What else
doesn't she know about?

01:10:15.332 --> 01:10:16.934
Do you dream much,
Seamus?

01:10:17.802 --> 01:10:20.462
The land of Gévaudan
had been cursed.

01:10:20.504 --> 01:10:23.065
At night, everyone had
the same dream.

01:10:23.107 --> 01:10:24.307
Who is she?

01:10:24.876 --> 01:10:26.068
What?

01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:28.369
The woman buried
in the field.

01:10:28.411 --> 01:10:30.072
Woman... I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:10:30.114 --> 01:10:32.349
She cursed the land.

01:10:33.483 --> 01:10:34.643
That's absurd.

01:10:34.685 --> 01:10:36.879
Is what you just saw absurd?

01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:38.547
The dreams, the beast.

01:10:38.589 --> 01:10:40.950
You were cursed,
and it started with Edward.

01:10:40.992 --> 01:10:44.019
Edward? Edward had
nothing to do with this.

01:10:44.061 --> 01:10:46.655
He will kill
and keep on killing.

01:10:46.697 --> 01:10:48.891
- Edward is innocent.
- Anyone who survives an attack

01:10:48.933 --> 01:10:51.093
will change until the curse
has had its revenge.

01:10:51.135 --> 01:10:53.829
Revenge? I am the one
seeking revenge

01:10:53.871 --> 01:10:56.641
for what this thing
has done to my family!

01:11:00.678 --> 01:11:02.379
I started this,
so I will finish it.

01:11:04.148 --> 01:11:06.951
I will hunt it myself and put
an end to it once and for all.

01:11:08.853 --> 01:11:11.556
Now you burn
this thing...

01:11:13.991 --> 01:11:15.860
...whatever it is.

01:11:21.966 --> 01:11:23.592
Get the torch.

01:11:45.823 --> 01:11:48.059
Please don't leave us,
Nana.

01:11:55.465 --> 01:11:57.635
Go on, Charlotte.

01:12:35.472 --> 01:12:36.841
Isabelle...

01:12:38.809 --> 01:12:41.411
Who is the woman
buried in the field?

01:12:49.854 --> 01:12:53.515
It's the only trophy
that's kept locked in a drawer

01:12:53.557 --> 01:12:55.593
and not displayed
on the wall.

01:12:58.095 --> 01:13:00.497
We must find
what was buried.

01:13:04.769 --> 01:13:07.905
We've all dreamt of the silver
that has cursed this land.

01:13:09.807 --> 01:13:13.177
On the body of Timmy, I found
a page torn from the Bible.

01:13:14.979 --> 01:13:17.740
He knew something
about the silver,

01:13:17.782 --> 01:13:20.017
as there was
a passage underlined.

01:13:21.085 --> 01:13:23.846
"As silver is melted
in the furnace,

01:13:23.888 --> 01:13:26.657
so will you be melted
in its midst;

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.053
and you shall know
that I, the Lord,

01:13:31.095 --> 01:13:33.856
have poured out My fury
upon you."

01:13:40.705 --> 01:13:44.942
Ezekiel 22:22.

01:13:48.012 --> 01:13:49.213
Charlotte...

01:13:50.848 --> 01:13:52.683
is there anything
you can tell us?

01:13:53.617 --> 01:13:55.119
Anything at all?

01:14:11.002 --> 01:14:13.862
"And Judas asked,
'What are you willing to give me

01:14:13.904 --> 01:14:16.040
if I deliver Him over to you?'

01:14:16.907 --> 01:14:19.969
So they counted out for him
30 pieces of silver."

01:14:23.347 --> 01:14:25.908
The silver from the dream.

01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:29.078
You believe it was
the same silver given to Judas.

01:14:31.789 --> 01:14:33.758
Where is the silver?

01:14:38.829 --> 01:14:40.998
McBride, open the door!

01:14:50.174 --> 01:14:52.510
We've all prayed
for your safety.

01:14:52.943 --> 01:14:54.737
Some of the men
have joined Seamus

01:14:54.779 --> 01:14:56.105
to go and hunt the beast.

01:14:56.147 --> 01:14:57.639
We cannot control
what Seamus

01:14:57.681 --> 01:14:58.516
is doing or has done.

01:14:59.116 --> 01:15:01.118
I believe there is
a way to stop this.

01:15:01.786 --> 01:15:02.753
Charlotte...

01:15:03.387 --> 01:15:04.947
where is it?

01:15:27.812 --> 01:15:30.139
Saul,
send word to Molière.

01:15:30.181 --> 01:15:32.608
The army must
be deployed immediately.

01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:35.920
And, Saul,
I need a blacksmith.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:45.500
We'll try again tomorrow
at first light.

01:18:51.482 --> 01:18:52.507
Isabelle?

01:18:54.184 --> 01:18:55.919
Isabelle?

01:18:57.254 --> 01:18:59.181
Have you seen my wife?

01:18:59.223 --> 01:19:01.116
I'm sorry, sir.

01:19:01.158 --> 01:19:03.285
What's the matter with you,
are you sick?

01:19:03.327 --> 01:19:04.428
No, I'm fine.

01:19:04.995 --> 01:19:06.888
Go and clean yourself up.

01:20:21.972 --> 01:20:23.907
One hundred.

01:20:25.109 --> 01:20:27.077
Two hundred.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.447
Three hundred.

01:20:31.716 --> 01:20:33.550
Four hundred.

01:20:34.184 --> 01:20:36.011
Five hundred.

01:20:49.533 --> 01:20:51.168
Is anyone missing?

01:20:53.203 --> 01:20:54.905
Everybody's here.

01:20:56.173 --> 01:20:57.207
What is it?

01:20:58.142 --> 01:21:00.235
Where is the maid?

01:21:00.277 --> 01:21:02.371
She's in the kitchen,
why?

01:21:08.318 --> 01:21:09.587
I think
you should leave here.

01:21:11.288 --> 01:21:13.649
Charlotte, darling,
please go to your room.

01:21:22.099 --> 01:21:23.492
- Tomorrow.
- No, Seamus.

01:21:23.534 --> 01:21:25.160
We need John's help.

01:21:25.202 --> 01:21:26.461
We'll hunt again
at first light

01:21:26.503 --> 01:21:27.963
and put an end
to all this.

01:21:28.005 --> 01:21:29.164
And come back
empty-handed

01:21:29.206 --> 01:21:30.533
just like you did today.

01:21:30.575 --> 01:21:32.100
Like all the weeks
the army tried

01:21:32.142 --> 01:21:34.102
to hunt
the Beast of Gévaudan.

01:21:34.144 --> 01:21:36.104
It's you it wants,
Seamus.

01:21:36.146 --> 01:21:37.047
You and your kin.

01:21:37.882 --> 01:21:39.575
Dead or chains
makes no difference.

01:21:39.617 --> 01:21:41.276
You don't have
to go hunt for it,

01:21:41.318 --> 01:21:43.345
because it will hunt you
for what you've done.

01:21:43.387 --> 01:21:45.615
What I did I did
for my family.

01:21:45.657 --> 01:21:48.684
The gypsies, they had a claim
to the land, didn't they?

01:21:48.726 --> 01:21:50.961
- It was my land.
- And you stole it from them!

01:21:51.228 --> 01:21:53.623
- And I lost my son!
- Now you know the cost of greed.

01:21:53.665 --> 01:21:56.425
My wife and child paid the price
because of men like you!

01:21:56.467 --> 01:21:58.101
Please, please.

01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:01.564
I just want
to find my Edward.

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.142
Yes.

01:22:07.077 --> 01:22:10.080
Why don't you ask
your husband where he is?

01:22:12.784 --> 01:22:13.984
Get out.

01:22:15.587 --> 01:22:17.379
You know, Seamus,
all this time

01:22:17.421 --> 01:22:20.558
I thought I was tracking
the beast that took my family.

01:22:21.559 --> 01:22:24.328
But now I realize
I got it all wrong.

01:22:24.696 --> 01:22:26.455
I'm just the caretaker,

01:22:26.497 --> 01:22:29.090
making sure it all
gets put back in the box

01:22:29.132 --> 01:22:31.694
before any more
innocent people are killed.

01:22:34.304 --> 01:22:36.465
I'm staying here
until the army arrives.

01:23:17.749 --> 01:23:19.609
I miss Edward.

01:23:28.292 --> 01:23:30.452
Can you stay with me
here tonight?

01:23:30.494 --> 01:23:31.587
Of course, darling.

01:26:19.731 --> 01:26:21.264
Anais?

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.955
Anais?

01:27:47.819 --> 01:27:49.419
Have you seen Seamus?

01:28:17.414 --> 01:28:18.774
Isabelle!

01:28:18.816 --> 01:28:19.975
Isabelle!

01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:23.821
Charlotte!

01:28:24.856 --> 01:28:26.949
Charlotte, Isabelle!

01:28:26.991 --> 01:28:27.825
Isabelle!

01:28:30.828 --> 01:28:32.655
Seamus!

01:28:35.199 --> 01:28:37.660
It's Seamus,
he's gone outside.

01:28:37.702 --> 01:28:38.970
He's out...

01:28:39.502 --> 01:28:40.663
Find Charlotte.

01:28:40.705 --> 01:28:42.598
The house is on fire, go!

01:28:47.111 --> 01:28:48.537
Seamus!

01:28:51.682 --> 01:28:52.942
Seamus!

01:28:54.652 --> 01:28:55.845
Seamus!

01:29:17.074 --> 01:29:18.200
Charlotte.

01:29:21.946 --> 01:29:23.806
Charlotte,
we must leave the house.

01:29:27.484 --> 01:29:28.911
Seamus!

01:29:34.491 --> 01:29:35.885
Seamus.

01:29:49.607 --> 01:29:51.541
It was Anais.

01:29:52.509 --> 01:29:53.736
I shot it.

01:29:59.183 --> 01:30:02.019
I see the flames
every night, John.

01:30:02.954 --> 01:30:03.955
I was bitten.

01:30:05.856 --> 01:30:07.182
I'll change.

01:30:07.224 --> 01:30:09.827
Tell Isabelle and Charlotte

01:30:10.895 --> 01:30:12.487
I'm so, so sorry.

01:30:12.529 --> 01:30:13.956
No, no, wait, wait!

01:31:57.334 --> 01:31:59.628
Isabelle, Charlotte.

01:31:59.670 --> 01:32:00.829
Come on!

01:32:04.842 --> 01:32:06.735
Wait, where's Seamus?

01:32:10.815 --> 01:32:12.341
We have to get
to the church.

01:32:12.383 --> 01:32:14.843
It's the only
safe place. Let's go.

01:32:17.688 --> 01:32:19.014
Come on!

01:32:19.056 --> 01:32:20.191
Let's go!

01:32:41.078 --> 01:32:42.137
Come, come, come.

01:33:03.734 --> 01:33:04.969
Nana?

01:33:05.903 --> 01:33:07.905
Get down, get down.

01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:15.713
Stay still, stay still.

01:33:26.323 --> 01:33:27.382
Nana?

01:33:34.899 --> 01:33:36.725
Charlotte,
you must be quiet.

01:33:40.204 --> 01:33:41.196
Stay right there.

01:33:58.789 --> 01:34:00.057
Silver.

01:34:03.093 --> 01:34:05.187
Get up, get up!

01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:06.430
Come on, move, go!

01:34:07.431 --> 01:34:08.857
Come.

01:34:13.137 --> 01:34:15.230
Stay behind me
and move towards the church.

01:34:15.272 --> 01:34:17.866
Move, go, go.

01:34:45.836 --> 01:34:46.962
Let us in!

01:34:48.072 --> 01:34:49.831
Let us in!

01:34:53.444 --> 01:34:55.804
- Let us in!
- Open the door!

01:34:55.846 --> 01:34:57.272
Open the door!

01:35:02.253 --> 01:35:03.754
Close the door.

01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:07.391
What's happened?

01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.220
The manor is on fire.

01:35:11.262 --> 01:35:12.796
And Seamus?

01:35:14.298 --> 01:35:15.532
He didn't make it.

01:35:16.166 --> 01:35:17.859
We barely made it here.

01:35:17.901 --> 01:35:19.837
It stalked us
the whole way.

01:35:20.271 --> 01:35:22.532
Were you all that is left?

01:35:22.574 --> 01:35:23.941
Aye.

01:35:24.341 --> 01:35:26.134
So what do we do now?

01:35:26.176 --> 01:35:28.270
- We wait.
- Wait?

01:35:28.312 --> 01:35:29.813
Wait for what?

01:35:30.247 --> 01:35:32.341
No, no,
I'm tired of waiting,

01:35:32.383 --> 01:35:33.250
hiding.

01:35:34.952 --> 01:35:36.487
We're like sheep.

01:35:37.888 --> 01:35:39.549
If you're telling me
the thing that killed my son

01:35:39.591 --> 01:35:41.149
is just outside
those doors, I say,

01:35:41.191 --> 01:35:42.884
I say we go outside
and we kill it.

01:35:42.926 --> 01:35:44.520
You go out those doors
and you will be dead.

01:35:47.264 --> 01:35:49.500
How come you made it here?
You're not dead.

01:35:50.167 --> 01:35:51.969
I have something
it's afraid of.

01:35:53.037 --> 01:35:53.937
What?

01:35:54.572 --> 01:35:56.331
I have the silver bullet.

01:35:56.373 --> 01:35:58.166
But we have to wait
for daylight,

01:35:58.208 --> 01:36:00.603
draw it into the open
and have a clean shot.

01:36:00.645 --> 01:36:02.413
That is our only hope.

01:36:04.048 --> 01:36:06.141
We got word to Molière.

01:36:06.183 --> 01:36:08.443
The army will be here
by morning.

01:36:08.485 --> 01:36:10.421
- That's good.
- Now rest.

01:36:11.989 --> 01:36:14.149
We've got a long night
ahead of us.

01:36:38.248 --> 01:36:40.117
I believe this belonged
to your boy.

01:37:13.283 --> 01:37:15.552
What happened to Seamus?

01:37:18.222 --> 01:37:19.657
It was Anais.

01:37:22.126 --> 01:37:25.062
He was badly wounded
when I got to him.

01:37:27.699 --> 01:37:30.401
He told me to tell you
and Charlotte...

01:37:31.502 --> 01:37:33.404
that he was sorry.

01:37:40.411 --> 01:37:42.980
Is Edward lost
to this nightmare?

01:37:54.091 --> 01:37:55.926
I can't say.

01:38:14.612 --> 01:38:17.247
The sins of my people
have soiled.

01:38:18.783 --> 01:38:21.185
But now I come to you
as a mother,

01:38:22.019 --> 01:38:24.689
aching the weight
of my grief, please.

01:38:25.723 --> 01:38:28.718
Anything I can give,
any path,

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.153
please show me,
I beg you.

01:38:31.195 --> 01:38:34.189
Show us mercy, if there is
any hope, please show me.

01:38:34.231 --> 01:38:35.700
I beg you, Lord,
show us mercy.

01:39:44.802 --> 01:39:46.596
Please don't leave us,
don't go!

01:39:46.638 --> 01:39:48.463
Please, Mother!

01:39:48.505 --> 01:39:49.707
Edward.

01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:53.536
Mother, please, please,
come get me!

01:39:53.578 --> 01:39:54.712
Mother!

01:39:56.513 --> 01:39:57.840
Edward.

01:39:57.882 --> 01:40:01.084
Edward, I'm coming.

01:40:03.253 --> 01:40:04.747
Isabelle!

01:40:04.789 --> 01:40:06.114
No!

01:40:08.258 --> 01:40:09.719
Mother!

01:40:18.302 --> 01:40:19.695
Get back!

01:40:21.471 --> 01:40:22.598
Move!

01:41:29.607 --> 01:41:31.441
Enough!

01:41:32.209 --> 01:41:34.378
- Isabelle.
- Edward.

01:41:35.647 --> 01:41:37.280
Move out of the way.

01:41:37.949 --> 01:41:40.918
Please come get me!

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.579
No.

01:41:43.621 --> 01:41:44.622
I'm sorry.

01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:55.544
Picked them up
off the church floor.

01:44:02.627 --> 01:44:04.854
He doesn't remember
anything.

01:44:08.633 --> 01:44:09.533
Edward.

01:44:10.601 --> 01:44:11.769
Son.

01:44:13.503 --> 01:44:16.641
You and your sister are going
to come and live with me now.

01:44:17.541 --> 01:44:18.901
All right?

01:44:24.949 --> 01:44:27.777
None of this
was your fault, son.

01:44:33.958 --> 01:44:35.560
All right.

01:44:36.393 --> 01:44:37.995
Up you go.

01:44:38.796 --> 01:44:39.764
Charlotte.

01:44:43.568 --> 01:44:44.602
Charlotte.

01:44:51.175 --> 01:44:52.601
It's time.

01:45:24.633 --> 01:45:29.633
