Time to gobble up your lunch,
Geraldine, you jive turkey.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.463
I'm gonna have to change
your name to Luke Wilson,

00:46.546 --> 00:48.673
because you've grown into a bloated slob

00:48.757 --> 00:51.259
who will eat anything
and is gonna die this month.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.969
Cleveland, have you seen
the pizza, doughnuts

00:53.053 --> 00:55.013
and hamburgers I made Junior for lunch?

00:55.096 --> 00:57.140
It's all going to a worthy cause.

00:57.223 --> 01:00.727
This will be our best holiday together
since Yom Kippur.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.328
Cleveland, we're not Jewish.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.288
Oh, that's right. My writers are.

01:20.371 --> 01:22.207
You have nothing to worry about this year,

01:22.290 --> 01:23.750
because guess who's coming.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.543
Donna, we can't have guests.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.670
That bird will barely serve
the five of us.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.173
And that cloning mess I tried didn't work.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.804
When you gonna burn me them <i>Glee</i> DVDs?

01:35.887 --> 01:37.305
Shut up, turkey clone!

01:37.597 --> 01:40.058
My sister Janet's coming with her kids.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.060
What? I hate her!

01:42.143 --> 01:44.187
I hate all your sisters and your brother

01:44.270 --> 01:46.648
and your mom and your dad
and your children.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.233
Well, I'm sorry, but Janet's coming.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.276
Boo. Boo, Janet.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.402
Boo.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.987
Cleveland, that is not helpful.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.489
-Janet is my--
-Boo.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.825
Boo, Janet. Boo.

01:56.908 --> 01:57.951
She's only coming for--

01:58.034 --> 01:59.786
Boo. Boo, Janet.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.288
Liar. Stay somewhere else.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.082
Are you done?

02:05.333 --> 02:06.251
Good.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.670
-Janet's only--
-Boo.

02:12.757 --> 02:15.677
Junior, you know how much
I love Thanksgiving, right?

02:15.760 --> 02:17.303
Yeah, it's obvious.

02:17.387 --> 02:21.015
Well, that's how much I don't love
your stepmother's sister, Janet.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.143
She thinks she's better than everybody

02:23.226 --> 02:24.686
just 'cause she got all that money

02:24.769 --> 02:27.480
for having her foot run over
by a city bus.

02:27.564 --> 02:31.025
Cleveland, I really wish you'd ask me
before you start messing with the house.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.653
You didn't complain
when I put in the Murphy toilet.

02:33.736 --> 02:34.904
I'm in here.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.156
-Sorry.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.284
Diva alert.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.035
Janet!

02:41.119 --> 02:44.581
Look at you with your fine self,
and your fine dress, and your fine shoes.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.374
You look fine.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.210
So, this is what
big city success looks like.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.129
-How is Raleigh-Durham/
-Chapel Hill?

02:51.212 --> 02:53.590
Remember <i>Dynasty?</i> It's like that.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.550
Ooh, girl!

02:55.633 --> 02:57.927
Hi, Brian. Hi, D'Brian.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.762
Come give your Aunt Donna some sugar.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.642
Ah! My porcelain
Indian chief smoking a cigar!

03:04.726 --> 03:06.227
Careful, boys.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.981
Before I forget, is there someplace
I can plug in my--

03:10.523 --> 03:12.901
I'm sorry, do you know
what a BlackBerry is?

03:12.984 --> 03:15.820
-Ooh, it's like a typewriter phone.
-Mm-mm.

03:15.904 --> 03:19.407
I tell you,
it's so good to take a break

03:19.490 --> 03:21.701
from the fast pace of Tobacco Road

03:21.784 --> 03:24.829
and get back to Stoolbend,
where there's nothing going on.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.999
It must be nice not to worry
about how you look

03:28.082 --> 03:30.460
or what Italian restaurant
you're gonna go to.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.295
I don't think I'm brave enough
to eat Italian.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.756
That spaghetti stuff
looks like worms to me.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.342
You sound so ignorant right now.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.635
Oh, hey, Cleveland.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.721
Oh, Janet, so good to see you.
You look great.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.723
Make yourself at home and so forth.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.391
Great to see you, too.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.769
You haven't changed a bit.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.274
Hi, Aunt Janet.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.236
Roberta! Oh, look at you!

03:56.319 --> 03:57.487
All grown up.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.031
Ooh, and working that ass.

04:00.114 --> 04:03.326
Not a high, flat,
Sinbad-looking ass like this guy.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.411
CLEVELAND
<i>No tears, Cleveland.</i>

04:05.662 --> 04:09.332
<i>Be strong, for you and for Sinbad.</i>

04:09.415 --> 04:11.668
Aunt Janet,
you still doing that thing on TV

04:11.751 --> 04:13.294
where you pick the lotto numbers?

04:13.378 --> 04:15.213
I don't know. You tell me.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.382
Twelve, forty one, six.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.175
Those are just examples.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.469
She said numbers that were on TV!

04:21.552 --> 04:24.305
Big deal. I was once on TV, too.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.350
<i>We now return
to</i> What's Happening!

04:27.767 --> 04:29.352
Hey, Shirl, which one of these

04:29.435 --> 04:32.438
is the chicken salad,
and which is the tuna salad?

04:35.900 --> 04:37.193
That's tuna salad.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.404
That's chicken salad.

04:41.364 --> 04:44.117
Mm-hmm. These are what's happening.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.159
Mm, mm, mm!

04:47.787 --> 04:50.248
And the woman won't shut her mouth.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.167
Sometimes I just want to say,
"Can it, Janet."

04:53.459 --> 04:55.628
But then she'll say, "Leave, Cleve,"

04:55.962 --> 04:57.505
and I don't have another one.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.091
Of course, if I can get her

05:00.174 --> 05:03.261
to say, "Leave, Cleve," first,
then maybe I--

05:03.344 --> 05:04.637
Hey, Cleveland.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.930
Can it, Janet.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.765
Oh, please don't make me leave.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.058
Move over, fool.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.312
All day traveling with those kids,
I need a stiff one.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.147
So you're disqualified.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.277
-Burn notice.
-Ha!

05:21.070 --> 05:24.866
Next! Four more of those,
and a Cosmo for the lady.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.954
With a twist of lemon.

05:30.246 --> 05:33.124
CLEVELAND
<i>I've hated Janet since high school.</i>

05:33.458 --> 05:35.084
What's up, dough boy?

05:35.376 --> 05:38.421
Dough boy.
I like that.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.590
-It suits you.
-'Cause you're fat.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.219
-Who are you?
-This is Robert.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.596
I met him in detention.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.639
He's not like Cleveland here.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.641
He pees standing up.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.394
I always poop a tiny bit when I pee.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.439
So, Donna, if you're done
with Chumpty Dumpty,

05:56.522 --> 05:58.274
Robert's all yours.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.818
So what were you in detention for?

06:00.902 --> 06:02.862
Having too much charismo.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.572
That, and a little bit of arson.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.325
I think I can change him.

-Girl, what'd you do last night?
Me.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.151
Rub-a-dub-dub, two men in two Tubbs.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.528
Their last name is Tubbs.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.321
I told you to go out the window.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.656
Nah, Cleve's cool.

06:46.739 --> 06:47.782
Boned your sister-in-law.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.117
-What?
-Hold up.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.743
You slept with Holt?

No way!

06:53.746 --> 06:58.543
I bet this is the first Thanksgiving
where you got stuffed by a turkey!

06:58.751 --> 07:01.421
<i>Seasonal slam!</i>

07:06.175 --> 07:09.053
Hey, Janet, look at when I put
this little piece of meatloaf

07:09.137 --> 07:11.931
on this bigger piece of meatloaf.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.391
A lot of people would say,

07:13.474 --> 07:15.601
"What's that big piece
of meatloaf thinking

07:15.685 --> 07:17.395
being with that little piece?"

07:17.603 --> 07:19.021
But other people would say,

07:19.105 --> 07:21.399
"Good for that little piece of meatloaf."

07:21.482 --> 07:25.278
Ha, ha. Like I'm the first girl
to get drunk and sleep with a loser.

07:25.361 --> 07:29.240
You probably need three shots of Jaeger
to roll around with this tub of lard.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.411
I get thirsty at night.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.455
Yes! Thirsty.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.748
-Oh, who did I invite over

07:37.832 --> 07:40.668
for an awkward encounter
that I can laugh at?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.338
Look, Janet, it's my neighbor

07:44.422 --> 07:46.591
and your Pee-Wee adventure, Holt.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.592
'Sup, gorgeous?

07:47.675 --> 07:48.885
You didn't return any of my texts,

07:48.968 --> 07:51.304
so I took that to mean
you needed some face time.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.349
-Look, about last night--
-Rob Lowe.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.642
-You and me--
-Dupree.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.227
-We--
-Women's Entertainment Network.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.272
Look at you two,
finishing each other's sentences.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.191
Why don't the two of you go out tonight?

08:03.274 --> 08:05.109
-I got the kids.
-Donna will watch them.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.986
-I'm really tired.
-I made coffee.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.322
-But I have a hair appointment.
-That's a lie.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.617
Fine. If it'll get your fat ass
off my back, I'll go.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.785
What's the classiest place in Stoolbend?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.954
Applebee's.
-Ooh, I have a coupon.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.040
I won't be needing that.

08:19.123 --> 08:21.042
Ooh!

08:23.503 --> 08:25.713
Dinner was actually kind of fun.

08:25.963 --> 08:30.218
I've never been out with anybody
who tipped a waitress $100.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.513
-Eh, it's just a Benjamin.
-"Just a Benjamin?"

08:33.596 --> 08:37.475
That said, "Happy First Communion, Holt.
Love, Grandma Bea."

08:37.558 --> 08:39.268
Saving it for a special occasion.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.438
-And you're pretty special.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.732
Holt, you're crazy.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.859
Crazy sweet.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.110
Up.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.159
Oh, Holt.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.796
Still think it was a hilarious idea

09:06.879 --> 09:09.423
to send Janet and Holt
out on a date together?

09:09.507 --> 09:12.718
I can't believe they stuck us
with her kids all night.

09:12.969 --> 09:16.472
Brian's okay, but D'Brian is d'worst.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.308
What? I think Brian's much worse.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.270
Yeah, me, too,
but it didn't sound as clever.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.898
After the night we had,
we could use a laugh. Huh?

09:27.316 --> 09:28.985
There's some problems in here.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.612
-Wait. Maybe that's them.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.116
Oh, no, it's just one of Holt's
stupid Twitter updates.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.034
Oh, he's been tweeting all night.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.662
"Janet and I at Oreo Speedwagon."

09:39.870 --> 09:43.541
It's an REO Speedwagon cover band
that appeals to interracial couples.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.251
Maybe the white half.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.003
Listen to the rest of these.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.171
"Crushed a steak at the restaurant."

09:49.255 --> 09:52.133
"Ketel One, Ketel One, Ketel One.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.093
Why is there no Ketel Two?"

09:54.176 --> 09:55.803
That's good.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.014
"Just landed in Vegas with Janet."

09:58.097 --> 09:59.765
They went to Vegas?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.976
That is great news.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.980
Because the only thing that matters
is Janet's happiness at any given moment.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.941
Sure, she said she came to see me,

10:09.025 --> 10:11.402
but then she sticks me
with her bratty kids

10:11.485 --> 10:14.155
while she's out getting wined and dined
at Applebee's.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.157
Well, I want to go to Applebee's.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.658
Mm, me, too.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.577
Is it one of ours's birthday?

10:19.660 --> 10:21.412
This is just like high school.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.497
Always acting like she's better than me.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.958
Talking about, have I seen a BlackBerry?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.044
Bitch, I am a BlackBerry.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.503
You think you're a diva, Janet?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.881
Well, guess what, I'm a diva, too!

10:32.298 --> 10:33.215
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

10:33.299 --> 10:34.800
What is happening?

10:34.884 --> 10:38.012
This Thanksgiving,
Janet's watching the kids. All of them!

10:38.095 --> 10:40.931
And I'm the one
who's gonna have fun in Vegas.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.808
We're going to Vegas!

10:42.892 --> 10:44.352
And we are going to have...

10:44.435 --> 10:45.603
<i>♪ Fun ♪</i>

10:45.686 --> 10:51.400
<i>♪ Fun ♪</i>

10:51.984 --> 10:53.402
I'm a diva, too.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.909
-That would be tickets for two adults,

10:59.992 --> 11:02.536
five children and zero turkeys.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.747
Okay, seven round-trip, same-day purchase,

11:04.830 --> 11:06.248
day-before-Thanksgiving tickets.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.710
Your total is... $15,600.

11:09.794 --> 11:13.881
In that case, winged migration!

11:46.956 --> 11:48.749
I like these kid leashes.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.668
White people are onto something.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.880
Excuse me, have you seen
a short, unattractive gentleman

11:54.964 --> 11:57.550
who's overcompensating by dressing flashy

11:57.633 --> 12:00.261
and loudly bragging about how drunk he is?

12:00.344 --> 12:03.097
Ah, yes. He's right... everywhere.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.891
-Bro!
-Bro!

12:05.975 --> 12:06.851
Bro!

12:07.309 --> 12:08.978
Let me be more specific.

12:09.061 --> 12:13.816
This particular short gentleman
is with a tall, statuesque black woman.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.609
Oh, Bill Maher is right there.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.737
-Oh, hey, Donna.
-Hey, Bill.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.030
I am so annoyed at Janet.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.699
What kind of woman just runs off to Vegas

12:21.782 --> 12:24.201
and pays no attention
to her children's well-being?

12:24.285 --> 12:26.912
Mm. And on Thanksgiving.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.039
The holiest of holidays.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.082
Yah!

12:33.669 --> 12:35.588
All right, let's get rich.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.424
Dang, how are we supposed
to know which one's hot?

12:38.674 --> 12:40.509
Come on, Junior, you're the math genius.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.721
CLEVELAND JR. <i>The statistical
probability of a three-tiered game.</i>

12:43.971 --> 12:48.017
<i>Payout ratio of N to the X
over square root of N minus four.</i>

12:48.100 --> 12:50.478
<i>-Average number of attempts per jackpot--</i>
Jackpot!

12:50.561 --> 12:51.937
Yo! Yo!

12:52.021 --> 12:54.023
Earth to girth! I won!

12:54.106 --> 12:55.232
I hit it big!

12:55.316 --> 12:57.985
No. Uh-uh. Get out!

12:58.360 --> 12:59.987
I'm serious?

13:00.070 --> 13:02.031
Now we got to find
somebody who's old enough

13:02.114 --> 13:04.200
to cash in this ticket for us.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.118
Excuse me, miss.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.454
I was just wondering
what a pretty lady like you

13:08.537 --> 13:10.915
is doing sitting over here all by herself?

13:10.998 --> 13:12.041
I'm an escort.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.919
Well, if you help us cash in this ticket,

13:15.002 --> 13:18.380
you can escort my colleague and me
to dinner this evening.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.010
Love to.
Just let me go change my underpants first.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.346
You know what? Why don't we all do that.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.889
Meet back here in five.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.682
No wait, ten.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.937
It's you! Beyoncé!

13:33.020 --> 13:34.522
It's-a Beyoncé!

13:36.774 --> 13:37.817
Beyoncé?

13:38.859 --> 13:40.736
Damn right I'm Beyoncé!

13:41.237 --> 13:43.447
I'm married to Jay-Z.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.075
He liked it, he put a ring on it.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.327
You are most gracious, Beyoncé.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.788
I will Photoshop these

13:50.871 --> 13:53.958
to make her have sex
with tentacle monster.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.392

14:36.834 --> 14:38.878
-MILF alert!
-Got MILF?

14:38.961 --> 14:40.337
I'm Jon Gosselin!

14:40.421 --> 14:41.547
Cleveland, it's Donna.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.924
I've been to seven casinos
on the strip, four off,

14:44.008 --> 14:46.135
eight all-you-can-eat buffets,
I worked a car show,

14:46.218 --> 14:48.804
drove a Gypsy cab,
walked through The Luxor-- blech--

14:48.888 --> 14:50.180
but no sign of Janet or Holt.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.765
-How about you?
-Nothing.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.684
And I've looked everywhere, too.

14:54.602 --> 14:58.105
Even as we speak, I'm sitting here
with the Las Vegas Police Department

14:58.188 --> 15:01.358
searching through the records
of all incoming citizens.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.903
Sipping coffee
out of a little Styrofoam cup

15:03.986 --> 15:05.279
in a windowless room.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.364
Staring at a flickering computer screen--

15:10.743 --> 15:12.828
Oh, Donna, I'm at a pool.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.163
I'm sorry.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.915
I'll look, I'll find them.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.250
This pool don't mean nothing to me!

15:18.667 --> 15:20.836
I suppose I wanted to get caught.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.171
I'm sick!

15:36.352 --> 15:37.811
-Give me a break.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.189
No time. Got to go find Holt and Janet.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.983
Luke Wilson, make sure
no one steals my goggles.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.693
Cle-Bro, grub time.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.196
They were out of sliders
so I got you popcorn shrimp.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.823
I told you I'm sick!

15:49.907 --> 15:51.700
I found him an hour ago!

15:51.784 --> 15:54.954
I was gonna tell you,
but then I got hungry and thirsty!

15:55.037 --> 15:57.039
Oh, Donna.

15:57.122 --> 16:01.794
Nobody is more disappointed
in me right now than I am!

16:01.877 --> 16:02.711
No fries?

16:02.795 --> 16:05.673
Holt, we're here to return these kids
to their irresponsible mother.

16:05.756 --> 16:06.882
Now, where the hell is she?

16:06.966 --> 16:07.967
At King Dong's.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.927
All male revue. Bachelorette day.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.845
-We're getting married.
-What?

16:11.929 --> 16:13.639
Holt-a said they get-a married.

16:13.722 --> 16:14.682
Listen!

16:14.765 --> 16:16.058
I'm sorry!

16:16.141 --> 16:18.852
Holt, you don't want to marry Janet.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.354
Because of the C-section scar?

16:20.437 --> 16:22.064
Doesn't bother me. Bothers me a little.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.900
Cleveland, try and talk
some sense into him.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.527
I'll deal with my sister.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.362
Yah!

16:29.196 --> 16:31.824
-Listen, Cleveland--
-Holt, Janet's got two children.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.742
Children who need a father.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.579
And trust me, being a father
is a full-time job.

16:38.747 --> 16:39.623
Woo-hoo-hoo!

16:49.508 --> 16:51.844
I'll admit, I don't know much
about being a dad,

16:52.261 --> 16:53.137
but I'm gonna try.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.680
She's worth it to me.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.850
Besides, I got the world's greatest dad
as a teacher.

16:58.100 --> 16:58.934
You.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.562
I'll need a moment.

17:03.897 --> 17:04.773
Thank you, Freddy.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.278
Holt, you have my blessing.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.281
-Want to see pictures of her naked?
-Yes, I do.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.284
Mm. Thank you, Freddy.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.332
Donna! What are you doing here?

17:22.416 --> 17:25.669
I heard you were getting married,
so I got you a wedding gift.

17:25.753 --> 17:26.837
Your children!

17:26.920 --> 17:31.050
Janet, it's time for you
to stop acting like a child!

17:31.133 --> 17:32.718
Do you think I like being the grown-up

17:32.801 --> 17:35.637
while you hook up
with one random guy after another?

17:35.846 --> 17:38.932
You think I don't want to sleep
with every man who buys me a drink?

17:39.183 --> 17:41.435
'Cause I do. All women do.

17:41.727 --> 17:46.231
But I don't let myself,
because I have responsibilities.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.150
And so do you.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.487
If you're talking about the boys,
their father's a pastor.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.781
So they got God looking after them.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.159
Look, Janet, marriage
means something to Holt.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.245
He's not some late-night host
or governor of South Carolina

18:00.329 --> 18:02.081
or the best golfer in the world.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.499
Don't do this to him.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.334
Donna, this is my life.

18:05.417 --> 18:09.213
And I'd appreciate some respect
on this blessed day.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.183
-Before we get started,

18:21.266 --> 18:22.976
no, I'm not an Elvis impersonator.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.271
I just wear this costume
to remind his family that he's dead.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.107
Okay, on to the vows.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.986
"Janet, I have found in you

18:33.362 --> 18:36.532
the other half of myself...

18:36.615 --> 18:38.867
that I never knew I was looking for.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.330
Our souls have become intertwined,

18:43.413 --> 18:45.833
like the weird scene in <i>Avatar</i>

18:46.416 --> 18:48.544
where they did it under the light-up tree.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.506
We may not have much of a past,

18:52.589 --> 18:53.632
but we have a long,

18:54.091 --> 18:56.093
long future ahead of us.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.556
And I will always be here for you."

19:02.558 --> 19:04.017
The Holt abides.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.062
Died a drug addict on a toilet. Some king.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.272
Your turn, ma'am.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.778
Look, Holt, I can't marry you.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.071
My sister's right.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.199
You're too nice a guy
for a party girl like me.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.076
Oh, God.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.120
I-I think I need a Red Bull.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.538
Thank you, Freddy.

19:27.666 --> 19:31.545
I'm just realizing that I'm not ready
to settle down right now.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.297
I'm sorry.

19:36.466 --> 19:41.054
But I am open to being non-monogamous,
long-distance boyfriend and girlfriend.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.306
What does that mean?

19:42.389 --> 19:45.100
I'll sleep with you whenever I'm in town.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.311
Do I still have to dress up
like Austin Powers every time?

19:47.394 --> 19:48.979
I never asked you to do that.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.189
Didn't have to.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.024
Wedding's off, everybody.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.610
But we're still gonna shag, baby!

19:56.445 --> 20:00.365
It was the first Thanksgiving
where civilized people came together

20:00.449 --> 20:02.659
with a bunch of godless savages.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.622
Much like today, as my family
breaks bread with you,

20:06.705 --> 20:08.999
the human garbage of Las Vegas.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.960
We welcome you, leathery showgirl,

20:12.169 --> 20:14.087
joyless blackjack dealer,

20:14.338 --> 20:16.423
creepy rape-vibe magicians

20:16.506 --> 20:18.800
and creepy rape-vibe Carrot Top.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.887
I'd also like to welcome my son's escort,

20:21.970 --> 20:24.181
my stepdaughter's Asian entourage.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.266
We feed you long time.

20:27.059 --> 20:31.188
I also want to acknowledge
my teensy-weensy neighbor Holt

20:31.438 --> 20:34.650
and my loosey-vavoosey
sister-in-law Janet.

20:34.942 --> 20:38.862
Here's to them casually getting down
until she gets pregnant,

20:38.946 --> 20:40.948
and then they'll have some decisions!

20:44.284 --> 20:45.953
Would you like to do the honors?

20:48.914 --> 20:52.459
Dad, did you kill turkey Luke Wilson?

20:52.542 --> 20:54.044
No, son, I didn't.

20:54.127 --> 20:58.048
He had a coke-fueled heart attack
at a strip club early this morning.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.467
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!
