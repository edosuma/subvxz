00:01.901 --> 00:04.596
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
l'm your host, Tim Taylor.</i>

00:04.671 --> 00:07.139
You all know my assistant, Al Borland.

00:07.207 --> 00:08.868
Thank you, Al.

00:08.942 --> 00:13.276
OK. Today's first segment
is about stuff that's stuck.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.849
And we're not talking about Tim
gluing his head to a table.

00:18.385 --> 00:21.320
We're talking nails,
screws and bolts that get stuck

00:21.388 --> 00:23.083
and seem impossible to remove.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.124
That's right. OK?

00:25.191 --> 00:27.557
- Problem:
- [suspenseful music]

00:28.795 --> 00:30.422
A mangled head of a screw here

00:30.497 --> 00:33.261
<i>and the screwdriver
will not fit in the slot. Mon dieu.</i>

00:33.333 --> 00:36.234
[French accent] How will l finish
building ze bridge?

00:36.803 --> 00:38.896
Solution: Use your hacksaw

00:38.972 --> 00:42.339
to cut a new slot at a right angle
to the old one.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.340
[French accent] Perfect.

00:47.414 --> 00:50.315
<i>Screwdriver fits.
Now we finish ze bridge. Voilâ€¦!</i>

00:52.185 --> 00:54.949
- All right. Problem:
- [suspenseful music]

00:57.957 --> 01:00.721
The nail head is too deep
to remove with a claw hammer.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.957
<i>[French accent] Oh, mon dieu.
How will l build ze windmill?</i>

01:05.632 --> 01:08.362
Solution: Use your trusty cat's paw.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.460
You simply pound it with your hammer,

01:10.537 --> 01:15.600
making sure that the cat's paw
goes underneath the nail head,

01:15.675 --> 01:17.233
then just pull.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.968
[cat screeching]

01:26.252 --> 01:28.516
Let's move on to Al's tricycle.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.056
Actually, this is my father's tricycle.

01:31.124 --> 01:33.786
l hope someday
to hand it down to my child.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.097
- Problem:
- [suspenseful music]

01:40.600 --> 01:43.569
Doing refurbishing you find
some bolts are rusted shut.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.763
That is a real problem.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.704
[suspenseful music]

01:48.808 --> 01:53.575
Solution: Use a little penetrating oil
on the rusty area.

01:56.749 --> 02:00.617
lt should work perfect every time.
[straining]

02:02.088 --> 02:04.955
[stammering] You're bending it!

02:06.292 --> 02:10.160
When they're really stuck like this
you can use a little heat to help out.

02:15.034 --> 02:18.697
Well, if you're gonna use a lot of
heat you want to wipe off the excess...

02:18.771 --> 02:20.534
...excess...

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074

02:36.523 --> 02:39.651
You've completely destroyed my tricycle!

02:39.726 --> 02:41.159
[metal hitting floor]

02:42.929 --> 02:46.262
Well, look there.
The bolt came free.

02:47.700 --> 02:51.067
- lt's no longer a problem.
- [suspenseful music]

03:40.753 --> 03:43.722
Come on, Randy, hurry up.
l gotta take a shower.

03:43.823 --> 03:45.552
l thought you took one last night.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.185
- Now what do you think?
- Make that last year.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.626
My turn. Oh, what stinks?

03:51.698 --> 03:53.791
- Brad and it's still my turn.
- lt's not.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.800
- lt's my turn.
- Will you shut up?

03:55.868 --> 03:58.200
[whistles] Guys, guys, come on.
Knock it off.

03:58.271 --> 04:01.297
Mark, get in the shower. Brad, wait.
Randy, go dry off.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.433
- What is that smell?
- Brad.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.511
New plan. Brad, you go next
and use lots of soap.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.944
Yes, ma'am.

04:08.014 --> 04:11.848
Thirty-eight, 39, 221 ...

04:11.918 --> 04:15.547
- ...222, 223...
- ln your dreams!

04:15.622 --> 04:18.386
...225.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.426
[panting]

04:20.493 --> 04:23.428
You know, you should be thankful
l work out every day.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.930
- [arguing]
- What are the boys yelling about?

04:25.999 --> 04:27.227
lt's the shower again.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.736
Could you go out in five minutes
and pull Brad out and shove Mark in?

04:30.803 --> 04:33.363
- l'm ready for a shower.
- No! l have an early class.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.566
- l have to go first.
- You know my routine.

04:35.642 --> 04:38.907
l wake up, go to the bathroom,
exercise, take a shower,

04:38.978 --> 04:41.037
go eat, go back to the bathroom.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.810
Can't you change your routine
for one day?

04:44.484 --> 04:46.850
Then it wouldn't be my routine,
would it?

04:46.953 --> 04:49.786
Well, your routines are starting
to get very annoying.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.690
- l don't complain about your routine.
- l don't have the luxury of a routine.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.661
l stay flexible so l can deal
with everybody's problems.

04:56.729 --> 04:59.027
So, being flexible is your routine.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.435
Tim, why can't you just eat breakfast
and then shower?

05:04.504 --> 05:07.268
lf l eat breakfast early
l'll be hungry when l get to work.

05:07.373 --> 05:10.308
Then l'll have a snack
and push lunch way back.

05:10.376 --> 05:13.072
- So?
- Come on. Follow me here.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.512
lf l push lunch back
l won't eat dinner till late.

05:15.581 --> 05:18.072
l'll go to bed bloated,
feel uneasy and won't sleep.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.641
l'll be too tired to go to work.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.846
<i>Al will do Tool Time.
Ratings will plummet.</i>

05:21.921 --> 05:24.355
We'll lose the show, jobs,
our money, our house,

05:24.424 --> 05:26.449
be in a cardboard box on the freeway.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.321
lf you think taking a shower
is worth that...

05:29.395 --> 05:31.329
Oh, just go!

05:38.371 --> 05:41.340
So then, Tim spent 20 minutes
in the shower

05:41.407 --> 05:45.036
and another ten minutes powdering,
spraying and clipping.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.204
Who did l marry, a man or a poodle?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.441
You should see Harry in the bathroom.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.417
On second thought,
nobody should have to see that.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.286
lt was so frustrating.

05:56.389 --> 05:59.256
By the time that l got to school
and found a parking place,

05:59.325 --> 06:01.088
l missed half my class.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.384
- Hey, Jill.
- Hi, Marge.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.953
- Hi, Delores.
- Hey, Marge.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.259
So, what's going on?

06:06.332 --> 06:08.391
We're doing a little husband-bashing.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.333
Sorry l'm late.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.530
l'll have the beef dip.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.870
Speaking of dips,
l was just talking about Tim.

06:15.942 --> 06:19.275
l have got to find a way
to make him more flexible.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.108
You've got as much chance of that

06:21.214 --> 06:23.978
as Marge digesting the...
...[shouting] beef dip!

06:25.618 --> 06:27.518
Oh, boy.
l'm dead.

06:27.587 --> 06:31.523
Oh, listen. lf Tim is anything like Bob,
he'll never change.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.149
Every night it's the same.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.989
Seven o'clock: ''Where's the food?''

06:35.061 --> 06:37.029
Seven-oh-five: ''You call that food?''

06:37.096 --> 06:41.226
Seven-fifteen: ''Why'd you let me
eat so much food?''

06:42.535 --> 06:43.968
Tim does all that.

06:44.036 --> 06:47.403
Then he opens his pants,
sticks out his gut, and belches.

06:48.107 --> 06:51.133
Nobody is more set in his ways
than Harry.

06:51.210 --> 06:54.577
Every Saturday night at 1 1 :30
after the sports report,

06:54.647 --> 06:57.138
he wakes me up and asks
the same question:

06:57.216 --> 06:59.241
''You want to do it?''

07:00.920 --> 07:03.480
And they say romance is dead.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.685
lt's been that way for 25 years.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.193
l wish he could be
a little more spontaneous

07:09.262 --> 07:11.696
and skip a Saturday
every once in a while.

07:13.399 --> 07:15.867
OK. Well, l guess you both
have it worse than l do.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.300
Oh, no, you've got it worse.

07:17.403 --> 07:20.372
You're trying to start a new career
and Tim's screwing it up.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.839
- lt's only half a class.
- Today.

07:22.909 --> 07:25.275
Next thing you know,
it'll be half a semester.

07:25.378 --> 07:28.745
The older men get the more
their routines take over your life.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.339
You friend's right.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.974
By the time they're his age

07:32.051 --> 07:35.748
every minute of your day
revolves around them.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.313
Mildred, it's 1 2:00.
Where's my lunch?

07:38.391 --> 07:40.484
Where's my water?
Where's my pill?

07:45.565 --> 07:47.590
Where's my life?

07:58.811 --> 08:03.510
l can't believe
l've been in college for 35 years.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.119
But all l have to do

08:08.187 --> 08:11.953
is finish the very last sentence
of my dissertation

08:12.024 --> 08:15.084
and l'll finally get my doctorate.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.493
Doctor? Are you takin' me to the doctor?

08:23.769 --> 08:26.932
l'm not takin' you to the doctor.
l'm trying to get my doctorate.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.973
Who's gonna take me to the doctor?

08:30.076 --> 08:33.443
Nobody. You're not sick.
Except in the head.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.812
Now let me work.

08:35.881 --> 08:40.011
The president of the university
is gonna be here any second.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.849
ls he a doctor?
l hope so.

08:41.953 --> 08:46.084
Oh, no. He's coming here
to pick up my dissertation!

08:46.158 --> 08:47.853
Why don't you just take it to him?

08:47.927 --> 08:51.624
Because l have to be here to make you
lunch and help you to the bathroom.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.731
Well, just feed me lunch
in the bathroom.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.700
Better yet, l'll lock you
in the bathroom.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.932
- Grouchy old bitty.
- What did you say?

09:02.008 --> 09:03.498
- Who remembers?
- Eh.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.805
- Where's my lunch?
- Oh, go make it yourself.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.941
l need a few minutes of peace and quiet
to get this done.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.248
Mom, Randy won't let me
finish my shower.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.288
You've been in there for 35 years.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.988
And you still stink.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.425
Will you guys stop it!

09:23.496 --> 09:25.726
Aren't you ever gonna grow up?

09:27.333 --> 09:30.860
[Tim clearing throat very loudly]

09:33.105 --> 09:35.869
l gotta tell ya,
it's not looking real appealing.

09:39.011 --> 09:41.707
Well, l got something to eat,
no thanks to you.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.874
Oh. Just what you need, prunes.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.215
ls it hot?

09:49.055 --> 09:50.682
Are you hot?
l'm hot.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.657
lt's so hot.
l hate being hot!

09:54.727 --> 09:56.820
[wind blowing]

10:03.135 --> 10:04.966
<i>- [doorbell rings]
- He's here!</i>

10:05.037 --> 10:07.198
My dissertation! Ohhh!

10:07.306 --> 10:08.864
Where's page one?

10:09.742 --> 10:11.471
This it?
Nope, this isn't it.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.239
Tim, no, no!

10:14.113 --> 10:15.444
Oh.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.844
[sobbing]

10:22.154 --> 10:24.714
- Those are really good prunes.
- [Jill sobbing]

10:26.092 --> 10:28.060
Where is the bathroom?

10:28.928 --> 10:30.896
<i>- [sobbing]
- [doorbell rings]</i>

10:50.016 --> 10:51.313
What? Stop it!

10:51.384 --> 10:53.545
Old bitty?
l'm an old bitty?

10:54.887 --> 10:56.411
Sometimes.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.153
l was one sentence away from graduating

11:05.231 --> 11:09.065
and you used page 56
of my dissertation

11:09.135 --> 11:11.160
to wipe your drool!

11:11.237 --> 11:12.795
Stop hitting me.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.832
You're mad at me because of something
l did to you in a dream?

11:16.909 --> 11:19.639
Dreams are a window
into our subconscious.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.078
Well, close the window
and go back to bed.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.883
Tim, this is important.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.853
l dreamt that your stupid routines
ruined my life.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.856
Your 1 2:00 lunch, your exercising...

11:31.924 --> 11:34.893
What you call stupid routines
l call self-discipline.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.758
What you call self-discipline
l call obsession.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.627
What you call obsession
l call structure.

11:40.733 --> 11:44.169
What you call structure
l call neurotic compulsion.

11:44.236 --> 11:48.366
What you call neurotic compulsion
l call what l said the first time.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.876
Tim, l'm really upset about this.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.751
ls there any way we can talk about this
in the morning?

12:00.820 --> 12:03.948
lf l don't get enough sleep
l won't be able to do my exercise.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.526
There you go again.

12:08.594 --> 12:12.030
l don't care about
your idiotic exercise.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.757
Oh, you say that now.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.265
When you're 75 and your friends
are burying their husbands

12:18.370 --> 12:20.235
l'll still be fit and virile.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.536
You're not fit and virile now.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.171
Make jokes, will ya?
You'll be whistling a different tune

12:29.248 --> 12:32.217
when all those widows
are pinching my buns of steel.

12:45.397 --> 12:48.230
l'm home from school.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.632
[grunting]

12:54.406 --> 12:56.135
[grunting]

13:00.079 --> 13:04.311
Tim, l can't get my backpack off.

13:13.859 --> 13:17.989
Don't worry, honey. Your fit and virile
husband will give you a hand.

13:27.273 --> 13:28.900
Easy does it, old girl.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.933
Thank you, honey.
Thank you.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.309
So, how was school today?

13:34.380 --> 13:36.007
l don't know.

13:36.081 --> 13:37.571
l never got there.

13:40.019 --> 13:43.887
By the time l got dressed
and put my backpack on,

13:43.956 --> 13:46.322
school was over.

13:47.426 --> 13:49.894
How much time did you give yourself
to get ready?

13:49.962 --> 13:55.457
Well, l put my sweater on
last Tuesday.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.333
l buttoned it Wednesday.

13:58.971 --> 14:02.930
l remembered
l forgot my underwear Thursday.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.172
And then l had to start all over again.

14:07.880 --> 14:12.044
Let's face it, Tim.
l'm a broken-down old hag.

14:12.117 --> 14:15.018
You're a perfect physical specimen.

14:17.623 --> 14:21.081
lt's not too late, honey.
Just start a routine like mine.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.718
Fifty thousand push-ups...

14:22.828 --> 14:25.991
We'll weight train you.
You can do it around the house.

14:26.098 --> 14:27.622
Just lift with your legs.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.668
[straining]

14:31.036 --> 14:32.526
Oh.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.235
You are an inspiration.

14:37.109 --> 14:42.069
l don't know how you stayed with me
after the way l've let myself go.

14:42.147 --> 14:44.513
lt's just the kind of guy l am.

14:45.985 --> 14:50.115
There are thousands
of younger, sexier women

14:50.189 --> 14:52.817
who would be thrilled to have you.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.917
And l'd be thrilled to have them.

14:58.430 --> 15:01.058
But no matter how pathetic you look,

15:01.734 --> 15:04.066
no matter how fabulous l look,

15:04.870 --> 15:06.633
l'll never leave you.

15:06.705 --> 15:10.163
Well, God bless you and your routine.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.644
We've got a great show for you today.
Right, Al?

15:25.190 --> 15:26.885
Yes, we do.

15:26.959 --> 15:31.293
Although Binford won't allow Tim to do
any more shows involving power.

15:37.670 --> 15:43.040
Yesterday's electrical accident was
the straw that broke the camel's back.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.668
[coughing]

15:49.281 --> 15:52.546
l thought it was your mom
that broke the camel's back.

15:53.419 --> 15:56.149
l think it's time
you stopped making fun of my mother.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.688
Oh, yeah?
Why?

15:57.756 --> 16:00.452
Because she's been dead for 25 years!

16:01.493 --> 16:04.121
<i>Making fun of your mother
is a staple here at Tool Time.</i>

16:04.196 --> 16:06.562
The audience response
has always been huge.

16:06.665 --> 16:10.032
- 'Course, not as huge as your...
- That's it. l quit!

16:10.135 --> 16:11.762
- l quit.
- You can't quit.

16:11.837 --> 16:14.328
Ten more years
you qualify for health insurance.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.931
l'm not fallin' for that one again.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.041
- Timmy?
- What?

16:19.111 --> 16:21.807
- Could l have Al's lines?
- No.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.809
- Well, then l quit, too.
- Go ahead.

16:25.551 --> 16:26.882
<i>l'm not changing Tool Time.</i>

16:26.952 --> 16:29.853
<i>The audience loves Tool Time
just the way it is.</i>

16:31.523 --> 16:33.423
Right, audience?

16:33.492 --> 16:36.052
We haven't liked the show in 20 years.

16:36.628 --> 16:40.962
- Why do you show up every day?
- lt's part of our routine.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.409
Hey, Wilson?

16:54.713 --> 16:57.876
Well, hidey-ho, there, studly neighbor.

17:00.452 --> 17:03.421
<i>Today at Tool Time
Al and Heidi quit.</i>

17:03.522 --> 17:05.648
Uh, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

17:07.358 --> 17:10.419
Do you have any words of wisdom for me?

17:10.496 --> 17:13.021
Well, Tim, nothing of any significance.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.794
l've been giving you advice
for so many decades

17:15.867 --> 17:17.926
l'm at the bottom of the barrel.

17:18.002 --> 17:20.869
Barrel. How about this?

17:20.939 --> 17:23.237
More fun than a barrel of monkeys.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.703
That-that doesn't help me very much.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.145
Uh... um, ''monkey see, monkey do''.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.884
You gotta do better than this.
l mean,

17:33.952 --> 17:36.318
getting advice from you
is one of my routines.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.913
Well, it's your routine
that sucked me dry.

17:40.926 --> 17:42.860
Come on. You gotta have something.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.488
Well, let's try this one on for size.

17:45.564 --> 17:49.295
There was an old woman
who lived in a shoe

17:49.368 --> 17:52.132
She got sick of your routine
and l did, too

18:00.345 --> 18:02.609
Honey, Wilson turned into a shoe.

18:05.284 --> 18:08.117
Al and Heidi quit, but good riddance.
At least l got you.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.347
Jill?

18:09.421 --> 18:11.651
[weakly] Help.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.125
- Jill?
- Help me, honey.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.731
l can't hear.
The table's on you.

18:24.069 --> 18:26.902
Here. Remember to always lift
with your legs, honey.

18:26.972 --> 18:28.667
[straining]

18:28.740 --> 18:32.107
l tried to be as disciplined as you.

18:32.177 --> 18:34.543
But l failed.

18:36.281 --> 18:41.548
l only hope my untimely and tragic death

18:42.621 --> 18:46.887
won't interfere with your...
[gasping]

18:49.261 --> 18:51.354
...routine.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.395
[choking]

18:56.301 --> 18:58.166
Jill. Jill!

18:59.004 --> 19:00.562
Jill, wake up. Jill!

19:01.473 --> 19:03.236
Jill. Jill!

19:03.308 --> 19:05.868
Oh, no, no, no.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.277
Tim, wake up. You're having a bad dream.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.441
Jill, Jill.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.849
Jill. Wow.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.284
[whistles]

19:15.354 --> 19:17.049
- What a dream.
- What?

19:18.123 --> 19:20.489
- You were dead.
- Dead?

19:20.592 --> 19:22.423
Squashed under the coffee table.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.231
Heidi and Al left the show.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.461
And Wilson turned into Mother Goose.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.667
l'm gonna take a shower.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.902
- At 3:00 in the morning?
- You've got an early class tomorrow.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.945
This way l can be
a little more flexible.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.039
l go to the bathroom at 3:00,
shower at 3:1 0,

19:44.116 --> 19:46.880
breakfast at 3:25,
back in the bathroom at 3:45.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.185
Tim, it's the same routine,
you're just on London time.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.890
Come back to bed.

19:54.960 --> 19:59.624
Well, l gotta figure out a way
to be more flexible with this.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.461
That would be great.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.494
l don't want it to end up
like in that dream.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.232
- lt was that bad?
- lt was horrible.

20:07.306 --> 20:08.796
Oh, boy.

20:09.474 --> 20:12.238
You were gone.
Everybody l cared about was gone.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.279
l was all alone.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.712
l was terrific-looking
but l was all alone.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.517
What did l look like?

20:26.992 --> 20:29.688
l-l really didn't
get a good look at you.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.466
<i>Do you remember that old woman
in The Waltons?</i>

20:55.687 --> 20:56.779
Can you believe this?

20:56.855 --> 20:59.517
One hundred six years old
and look how good we look.

20:59.591 --> 21:03.152
l don't feel a day over 90.

21:09.534 --> 21:12.230
Well, teeth in or out tonight?

21:20.145 --> 21:23.114
- Now, problem:
- [suspenseful music]

21:23.181 --> 21:25.547
All right.
[laughing]

21:31.423 --> 21:33.721
- Problem:
- [suspenseful music]

21:34.793 --> 21:36.761
[laughter]

21:41.133 --> 21:43.966
- And we're not talking about...
- [both laughing]

21:48.974 --> 21:51.534
Does anybody care what time it is?

21:52.577 --> 21:53.942
No!
