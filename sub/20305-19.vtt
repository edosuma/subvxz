NARRATOR <i>:</i>
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.713
-CLARA: Freeze!
-(gunshots)

00:05.547 --> 00:07.966
Oh, boy. I had to do that.

00:08.049 --> 00:10.510
-Bobby Hill, my Daryl Ann's pregnant.
-You're kidding.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.679
A little cowboy? Great!

00:12.762 --> 00:14.055
I just need more time, that's all.

00:14.139 --> 00:18.476
Well, I don't have more time.
You gotta make up your mind.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.603
(gunshots)

00:25.066 --> 00:26.985
She says they've got
a witness against you.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.154
Don't worry about it, bro.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.282
You ain't got to worry about
no trouble from no witness.

00:32.365 --> 00:35.118
If anything happens to my wife,
I'll kill you.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.163
Tell her, chump.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.623
Tell her I'm coming.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.834
I mean, I have these two tickets,
uh, to the Philharmonic's

00:42.917 --> 00:44.878
upcoming rendition of <i>Mahler's Fourth.</i>

00:46.212 --> 00:47.756
Kasakowski's conducting.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.883
Like I said, I can't.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.552
And I have two tickets
to the Philharmonic's

00:52.635 --> 00:56.389
upcoming rendition of <i>Mahler's Fourth,</i>
and I would be honored if you'd join me.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.892
Howard, are you asking me out on a date?

00:58.975 --> 01:00.977
(siren wailing)

01:01.061 --> 01:02.270
MICK: Come out from there!

01:02.353 --> 01:04.439
Captain Furillo's reservations aside,

01:04.522 --> 01:08.109
our operation
against flagrant drug trafficking

01:08.193 --> 01:09.778
continues in that vicinity.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.697
Are you now retracting
what you said yesterday

01:12.781 --> 01:14.491
about Stop 'N' Cop being a sham?

01:14.574 --> 01:15.950
-MALE REPORTER 1: Sir...
-That's all I have.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.786
(reporters clamoring)

01:17.869 --> 01:19.537
I can't keep you on the Hill.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.499
You had your chance to make amends
and you threw it right back

01:22.582 --> 01:24.375
-in Ozzie's face.
-His order.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.628
You forced my hand. You're out. That's it.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.634
(wind chimes jingle)

01:35.011 --> 01:35.845
Help you?

01:37.180 --> 01:39.557
Uh, scotch. A fifth.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.521
-(indistinct chattering)
-LUCY: <i>Item six, absences.</i>

01:44.813 --> 01:46.815
LaRue has definitely got mono.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.399
That means he'll be out
three weeks minimum.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.694
-(laughter)
-(whistling)

01:51.778 --> 01:54.364
Guy is sick!
Let's not make a party out of it!

01:55.573 --> 01:56.699
And the big absence...

01:57.575 --> 01:59.244
which when I talked to him this morning,
he had the flu,

01:59.327 --> 02:03.039
but even if he were well, Captain Furillo
has been reassigned to Division.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.874
(all groaning)

02:04.958 --> 02:06.668
Which, in my opinion, stinks.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.463
But then, expressing an opinion
is exactly what got him in trouble.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.425
-So, moving right along to item seven.
-Who they bringing in?

02:14.926 --> 02:17.720
We won't know for about a week.
In the meantime,

02:18.346 --> 02:20.723
command is Lieutenant Hunter
and Lieutenant Calletano.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.225
Item seven, Stop 'N' Cop.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.353
And this comes directly
from Deputy Chief Briscoe at Division.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.356
(all groaning, murmuring)

02:28.439 --> 02:33.444
Every available body will be on the street
for immediate assist and backup

02:33.528 --> 02:36.406
for all observed narcotic transactions.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.199
Luce, everybody?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.326
Everybody means everybody.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.329
First will be on that
slimline radio storefront.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.415
And Chief Briscoe says that
they're really looking

02:45.498 --> 02:47.458
-to make some dents out there today.
-MICK: That's a lot of crap.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.002
-(all grumbling)
-Hey, look!

02:49.502 --> 02:52.672
Everybody knows what the mayor's attitude
is on this one.

02:52.755 --> 02:55.175
-(all grumbling)
-So let's just go out there,

02:55.258 --> 02:57.635
-dig our heels in, and do it.
-That's right.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.763
Last item, William Mullins.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.474
He was rereleased this morning.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.104
Now, this guy's brother was fingered
by Joyce Davenport yesterday.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.608
She's getting protection.
But when she's around, be alert.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.110
And let's show that
we're aware of the situation.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.571
That's it.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.115
-Captain coming back?
-Is there anything we can do?

03:20.116 --> 03:22.535
I don't know.
They say that he's not coming back.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.828
(all muttering)

03:23.912 --> 03:26.247
-Man, Cleveland's gotta be crazy.
-Yeah, right.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.583
All right, look.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.961
We're all gonna know
all about this soon enough.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.048
So in the meantime, we just do our jobs.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.842
So let's just roll
and be careful out there.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.511
Gonna have no problem at all,
will we, huh?

03:40.595 --> 03:44.224
-BOBBY: No, that's right.
-(indistinct chattering)

03:48.186 --> 03:50.897
-Lieutenant, can I see you for a second?
-Sure.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.198
Remember Whitney Barnes?

04:00.823 --> 04:03.117
-"Town house tapes?"
-Yes.

04:03.993 --> 04:07.288
Well, Chief Daniels
is on this one with her.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.708
-How do you come into possession of this?
-J.D. made a copy.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.920
Neal, doing that with evidence is illegal.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.506
That's what I told him.
That's why I took it away.

04:17.131 --> 04:20.134
As long as I didn't get rid of it yet,
maybe we can help the captain.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.804
I don't believe this would be
the way to go about it.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.016
-(plastic rattling)
-Then... (clears throat)

04:27.100 --> 04:28.726
I'm returning evidence, Lieutenant.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.859
Hey, will you wait one second for me?

04:37.235 --> 04:39.112
-Yeah, I'll be over here.
-Thanks. Sarge?

04:39.862 --> 04:43.241
I don't want to be a pain,
um, but IAD put me on desk today.

04:43.574 --> 04:46.577
I talked to Briscoe personally about you.
He said you had to go out.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.330
I reminded him that you were
officer involved just yesterday.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.124
-Yeah.
-He said everybody goes out.

04:51.582 --> 04:55.295
-Okay. Okay.
-I killed somebody once.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.342
If you ever want to talk about anything...
I don't know.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.636
Thanks, Lucy.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.308
-Clara?
-Yeah?

05:08.725 --> 05:13.146
-Uh... how are you today?
-I'm okay. Um, I'm gonna be okay.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.398
I understand how difficult

05:15.481 --> 05:17.358
-it must be for you.
-Thanks.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.944
Um, by the way,
I happen to have two tickets

05:20.028 --> 05:21.988
-to the Philharmonic tonight.
-Is that right?

05:22.071 --> 05:24.907
Yeah, it's a <i>Mahler's Fourth.</i>
Kasakowski's conducting.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.451
-RAY: I'm sorry.
-Would you like to go?

05:26.534 --> 05:27.827
RAY: Never gave permission.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.580
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.290
I can have a key made in half an hour.

05:32.373 --> 05:36.377
If Frank had wanted a key made,
he would have said so.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.255
Ray, could we please not water
the hydrant about this?

05:39.547 --> 05:41.132
We're not doing such thing, Henry.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.885
I have been left in charge,
and I am the boss.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.263
Oh, no, no, no, no, Raymondo.
I am the boss.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.890
I am the boss, Howard.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.642
Oh, I'm not arguing rank, compadre.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.519
It's inflection.
You're stressing the wrong word.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.439
It's not "I am the boss."
It's "I am the boss."

05:56.522 --> 05:57.899
You are a jerk!

06:00.318 --> 06:03.154
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:03.237 --> 06:04.989
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:05.073 --> 06:08.701
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:08.785 --> 06:10.703
(sirens wailing)

06:16.084 --> 06:19.879
(theme music playing)

07:40.209 --> 07:41.961
JOYCE:
I didn't hear you come in last night.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.754
I was late. (sighs)

07:43.838 --> 07:45.882
-Where'd you go?
-For a walk.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.675
Got the flu.

07:49.969 --> 07:50.887
You all right?

07:51.721 --> 07:54.140
-(chuckles)
-Are you all right?

07:54.724 --> 07:56.434
You've been reassigned. You're sick.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.771
There's a Sergeant Moriarty outside,
my escort.

08:01.898 --> 08:02.732
I don't know him.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.276
He's reading retirement brochures.

08:05.359 --> 08:08.362
-Great confidence builder.
-You have a bodyguard.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.826
-Just in case he takes off for Florida.
-No good, Joyce.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.037
Frank, I don't want to argue about it.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.583
-Are you going in to Division?
-See how I feel.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.463
What can I bring you home?
Some chicken soup?

08:25.546 --> 08:27.840
-Great. Thanks.
-I hope you feel better.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.933
-Good morning, Ray.
-Good morning, Chief.

08:37.016 --> 08:40.269
-Any fires up here?
-Chief, excuse me.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.690
I am wondering if there is any chance
you will reconsider Frank's reassignment.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.735
-Reconsider, Ray?
-Frank made a mistake.

08:47.818 --> 08:51.656
-He made several.
-But I believe he deserves consideration.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.866
This is the mayor's play, amigo.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.745
And the mayor's not currently disposed
to do Captain Furillo a favor.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.581
Of course, Ozzie was your man
in the election, Ray,

09:00.665 --> 09:01.832
maybe you can prevail on him.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.501
-Chief.
-Henry.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.379
We gonna kick some butt
on Stop 'N' Cop this morning?

09:06.462 --> 09:09.215
-Gonna try.
-You may see Warren Briscoe out there.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.384
-Okay.
-Off the record,

09:11.467 --> 09:14.720
I'm thinking of him as
the transitional guy for your precinct.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.975
-Ray.
-I hate that man.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.357
What's the deal, Lieutenant?

09:27.817 --> 09:30.236
Division's assigned a bodyguard
to the captain's wife.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.904
I want to go after it from the other end.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.906
Good. Good for you.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.993
I don't want this sociopath Mullins
anywhere near Joyce Davenport.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.830
-What are we talking about here?
-We're talking about Mullins is a junkie.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.915
When he's released from Michigan Avenue,
we put a tail on him.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.793
When he tries to cop,
we roust him and his connection.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.878
Shut this guy off cold,
and sooner or later,

09:47.962 --> 09:50.131
he could make a mistake he'll go away for.

09:50.214 --> 09:53.175
-Or blow town.
-Either of which would be fine with us.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.011
I thought we were on Stop 'N' Cop.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.971
I'm running command post
on Stop 'N' Cop, Harry.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.222
I can take care of that part.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.100
But maybe you'd like to be reassigned.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.729
-Nah, I don't wanna be reassigned.
-Okay.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.155
-Leo?
-LEO: Hi, Ms. Davenport.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.658
-Uh, Mr. Louis Burke?
-Uh, interrogation.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.785
That's where I'll be, Detective.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.495
Oh, okay.
I'll wait right outside the door.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.580
LUCY: Ms. Davenport?

10:23.873 --> 10:27.043
Um, what you did in court yesterday,
it meant a lot to a lot of people.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.086
Thank you.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.507
-LEO: Anybody see my catcher's mitt?
-Your catcher's mitt?

10:33.841 --> 10:36.844
I had the oil, I had it wrapped.
I'm trying to break in the pocket.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.847
-Uh, no, I haven't seen it, Leo. Sorry.
-Damn!

10:39.930 --> 10:42.266
I shouted, "The suction was reversed,"

10:42.350 --> 10:45.478
and like a shot,
they were sucked down into the drain.

10:46.062 --> 10:46.979
Excuse me?

10:48.064 --> 10:51.108
My gentles. The-the family jewels.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.402
-You're saying literally--
-They were sucked down

10:53.486 --> 10:56.322
to the whirlpool drain.
This is why I hit him.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.074
Dennis Dililo?

10:58.157 --> 11:01.744
Yeah. Substitute therapist.
I'm going there seven weeks for my back.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.537
I never saw him before today.

11:04.288 --> 11:07.792
Not only he pushes the wrong button,
but he becomes hysterical.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.169
I can't pry his hand off the button.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.381
I'm struggling. I got one hand
over the side of the tub,

11:13.464 --> 11:15.383
the suction is crucifying me,

11:15.466 --> 11:18.094
he's screaming,
and I can't get his hand off.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.848
This is when you struck
Mr. Dililo in the jaw?

11:22.932 --> 11:26.686
I'm not a violent man, but I felt
as if my gentles were in a vise.

11:27.978 --> 11:31.691
Uh... without knowing the extent
of the other man's injuries,

11:31.774 --> 11:36.028
it's, uh... hard to tell where...
they're going with this, uh--

11:36.112 --> 11:37.905
I didn't think I hit him that hard.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.908
Uh, at the arraignment, we may find
that they brought these charges

11:40.991 --> 11:43.160
simply to deflect you from a civil suit.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.371
(stammers) I understand. Thank you.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.545
-Are you all right?
-I'm in considerable discomfort.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.057
Hey, hey. Hold it up a minute.
Looks like he's getting off here.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.269
Uh-huh. Okay, Mr. Mullins. Showtime.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.770
J.D.: I think he's gonna cop.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.401
-Oh, man.
-(tires squealing)

12:15.860 --> 12:17.153
We'll keep you a fresh face.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.946
-Police!
-Okay, hit the wall. Move it!

12:19.280 --> 12:20.406
I said move it, chump!

12:21.782 --> 12:24.285
All right, man, come on.
This is nothing but a narco bust.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.163
We're helping this guy kick.
That is right.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.623
-We gonna help you out, bro.
-This guy is shut off.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.710
Anyone sells to him,
there's no plea bargain,

12:32.793 --> 12:33.753
there's no rollovers.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.214
The bust goes to the head of the class,
guaranteed you go away.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.633
-MAN: The guy's eighty-sixed.
-You got it.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.552
Now you spread it around.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.555
What you fools think youse doing?

12:44.638 --> 12:46.682
Hey, you gonna make me mad
if you jump bail with me, William.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.310
-As much as I want to help you out, bro.
-You're gonna stay clean, Mullins,

12:49.393 --> 12:51.562
and we're gonna be right inside
your shirt, helping you.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.064
I hope you didn't spend
your last dough for this, man.

12:55.232 --> 12:58.152
Ain't no big deal, man.
I be high in an hour.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.030
Then I got me some business
to take care of.

13:01.113 --> 13:05.326
You ain't doing business no more, chump!
You got that? You are getting done to.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.578
So you can forget about
all your threats. Now walk.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.458
Hey, what can we do for you,
William, huh? Huh?

13:15.711 --> 13:17.129
Be seeing you, Mullins.

13:26.388 --> 13:30.476
I have committed myself to exactly nothing
with this purchase, Robert.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.522
I took the item to a pawn shop,
and the gentleman offered me $50,

13:34.605 --> 13:37.399
which is exactly
what I paid Jackie O'Dell.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.361
-Who are you talking to?
-I thought I was talking to you.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.655
Sounds like to me
you're talking to yourself.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.448
(sighs) Is that so, Dr. Freud?

13:44.532 --> 13:48.410
Yep. Just before taking
(German accent) the matrimonial plunge.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.412
WOMAN (on radio): <i>Unit 2202, shots fired,</i>

13:50.496 --> 13:53.666
<i>-98th and Utica. Respond.</i>
-2202 in response.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.168
-(siren wailing)
-Don't be so snide and smart!

13:56.252 --> 13:59.129
Hey, I approve, Renko.
I think Daryl Ann's the greatest.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.675
Then don't tell me what I have
or have not decided on.

14:02.758 --> 14:03.676
Okay, that's fine.

14:04.134 --> 14:07.763
When I plunge into those icy waters,
I shall be the first to know.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.181
Right.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.643
(siren blaring)

14:18.774 --> 14:19.775
(gunshot)

14:20.025 --> 14:21.902
-What the hell's going on, Jesus?
-She's crazy.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.571
This chick's trying to cash me in.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.240
-RENKO: Who might that be, Jesus?
-Claudia, Claudia Ramirez.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.075
She comes.
She starts shooting up the place.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.577
CLAUDIA: I've got you now, Jesus!

14:29.660 --> 14:31.662
-You're a dead man.
-(gunshot)

14:31.745 --> 14:33.414
She thinks I'm barricaded
inside my office.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.708
-You know her?
-Yeah, a little.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.587
Señorita Claudia,
would you please kindly come out here?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.046
CLAUDIA: He lied to me!

14:41.130 --> 14:43.048
(speaking in Spanish)

14:43.132 --> 14:44.884
(in English)
He promised he'd do the right thing!

14:44.967 --> 14:47.720
See what I mean? Completely unreasonable!

14:47.803 --> 14:51.056
Claudia, Jesus is with us.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.766
-(gunshots)
-(glass shatters)

14:55.519 --> 14:57.980
-Claudia? Claudia!
-(gunshot)

14:58.814 --> 15:02.443
Now, you listen here, girl.
He is in protective custody.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.612
You come out, and we'll reason about this!

15:04.695 --> 15:06.405
(siren blaring in distance)

15:06.488 --> 15:09.366
Claudia, throw the gun out
so we can see it!

15:09.909 --> 15:11.285
Nobody needs to get hurt!

15:14.246 --> 15:15.247
(clattering)

15:19.835 --> 15:22.546
Okay, darling, you can come out now.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.308
Jesus.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.900
Jesus, you gonna be a daddy?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.277
That seems to be the rumor.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.949
-JOYCE: Fay?
-I just got your message.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.408
I was just trying to call you again.

15:51.492 --> 15:55.371
Listen, Henry told me about Frank.
I mean, are they nuts? Transferring him?

15:55.454 --> 15:56.497
It's complicated.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.833
-Well, is he all right?
-I think so.

16:00.209 --> 16:03.379
-Fay, do you remember a Claudia Ramirez?
-No.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.589
You interviewed her
for that unwed-mother panel.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.801
She demanded to speak with you
before she'd discuss her case.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.638
-What case?
-She took a shot at Jesus Martinez.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.306
FAY: I like her taste in targets.

16:14.848 --> 16:15.849
(door opens)

16:17.476 --> 16:19.311
-CLAUDIA: Mrs. Furillo?
-Claudia?

16:19.395 --> 16:20.562
CLAUDIA: You remember me?

16:20.938 --> 16:22.648
-To tell you the truth--
-You talked to me!

16:22.731 --> 16:24.525
Later you came back with some groceries.

16:24.608 --> 16:28.195
Oh, my gosh.
You were my first interview. How are you?

16:28.779 --> 16:30.447
JOYCE:
She's charged with attempted murder,

16:30.531 --> 16:33.534
illegal possession
and discharge of a firearm.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.577
On the other hand, no one was hurt.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.330
Property damage was minimal.
She's an expectant mother.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.125
I can't believe Jesus signed a complaint.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.461
Because he knows I'm coming after him.
He knows he don't get no peace.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.716
He's the father?

16:49.341 --> 16:52.219
Claudia, threats like that are exactly
what the court is concerned about.

16:52.302 --> 16:55.222
We have to assure the judge
there won't be any more violence.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.224
I don't give no promise.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.685
Claudia, you don't really
want to kill Jesus.

16:59.768 --> 17:04.148
No! I want that he marries me.
I want a father for my baby.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.735
Have you and Jesus sat down
and talked about this?

17:07.818 --> 17:11.196
He wouldn't. So I do what you told me.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.074
You said, "If the father won't talk
to you, put a gun to his head."

17:18.370 --> 17:19.788
That was a figure of speech.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.916
Our first order of business
is getting these charges dropped.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.752
I think our chances are fairly good,

17:25.210 --> 17:28.130
as long as there are no outbursts
in the court. No yelling at Jesus.

17:28.213 --> 17:31.258
FAY: Claudia, do you understand
what Ms. Davenport's saying to you?

17:32.843 --> 17:37.139
I won't make no trouble.
Will you come? Maybe you can talk to him.

17:37.681 --> 17:41.143
-Oh, I don't know what I could say.
-Say he should marry me!

17:43.937 --> 17:45.355
Say I don't wanna be alone.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.704
-Thanks.
-So, how are you doing?

18:02.664 --> 18:04.625
Lieutenant Hunter asked me out on a date.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.210
(chuckles) Yeah?

18:07.961 --> 18:11.882
-Yeah. I... I think he's a nice guy.
-Yeah, he's very nice.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.469
Well, at least I can get
the name of his shrink.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.471
Hey, one day at a time.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.723
Oh, man, I've been having
these nightmares.

18:20.891 --> 18:21.850
Real doozies.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.853
Look, that's gonna happen for a while.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.481
WOMAN (on radio): <i>All units,</i>
<i>Stop 'N' Cop suspect fleeing on foot,</i>

18:27.564 --> 18:30.776
<i>northbound, 1400 Dekker.</i>
<i>Request all backup units.</i>

18:30.859 --> 18:31.860
They're coming right at us.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.452
(siren wailing)

18:48.836 --> 18:49.670
Halt!

18:57.678 --> 18:59.388
(gunshots)

19:15.070 --> 19:15.904
Call an ambulance!

19:18.157 --> 19:20.993
Oh, God. Oh, God.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.497
Why the hell wasn't Pilsky on a desk?

19:25.581 --> 19:26.665
Orders from Division.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.251
They wanted everyone on the street
for Stop 'N' Cop.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.547
Later, Ray.

20:36.151 --> 20:40.322
Uh, yeah. Uh, is Bob Tunell there?
This is Frank Furillo calling.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.826
Well, would you know where that is?

20:45.619 --> 20:47.829
Cou-- Yeah.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.087
-That's gonna get you right.
-Get out of here, man.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.005
-Get out of here, man!
-Hey.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.924
-Spread 'em!
-Hey, man!

21:00.217 --> 21:02.678
-Man, don't do this to me!
-Or what?!

21:02.844 --> 21:04.888
Hey, for the second time,

21:04.972 --> 21:07.975
I guess we can find it in our hearts
to forgive you for this, William.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.518
I'm gonna kill you!

21:09.601 --> 21:12.854
Oh, is that the way you talk to somebody
who's concerned about you?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.231
-No heat?
-He's clean.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.942
Now we're gonna pick up the bozo
who dealt you, Billy boy.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.193
Have a talk with him, too.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.612
You're gonna be out of connections
real soon, bro.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.116
Hey, man.

21:27.327 --> 21:30.580
You get smart!
You find another city, hair ball!

21:36.086 --> 21:36.920
(engine starts)

21:37.004 --> 21:38.755
-I'm gonna get you, suckers!
-(car horn honking)

21:38.839 --> 21:39.673
(groans)

21:44.261 --> 21:47.055
-(laughing)
-Bob?

21:48.598 --> 21:49.558
Frank.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.935
Uh, could I ask you
to excuse us for a minute?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.687
-It's very important.
-Sure.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.439
-Thank you.
-I'll be at the bar.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.569
FRANK:
I'm sorry to track you down like this.

22:00.652 --> 22:01.695
Don't be silly, Frank.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.032
So, uh, tell me.

22:05.115 --> 22:08.827
So, uh... I bought a bottle last night,

22:08.910 --> 22:12.164
and a half-hour ago,
I poured myself a glass.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.166
-Did you drink it?
-FRANK: No.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.753
But, uh, I'm running out of steps.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.256
-What brought it on, Frank?
-(chuckles)

22:23.467 --> 22:26.428
Um... my job...

22:27.721 --> 22:31.475
I got into a beef with my bosses
and wound up transferred.

22:32.893 --> 22:33.727
My marriage...

22:35.103 --> 22:36.355
my wife and I are, uh...

22:38.690 --> 22:42.069
pretty distant at the moment.
I'm not sure what all the issues are, Bob.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.614
What I do know is that, uh,
for the first time in...

22:47.532 --> 22:48.533
seven years...

22:49.451 --> 22:52.412
ever since that time I called you
at two o'clock in the morning...

22:55.040 --> 22:57.376
(stammers) I really feel
as if I might wind up drinking.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.130
Well, it's very simple. (sighs)

23:02.506 --> 23:05.842
-Francis, don't do it.
-(exhales)

23:07.677 --> 23:09.930
Not if you think it's gonna
put you back on the skids.

23:11.556 --> 23:12.599
WAITRESS: Seven and seven.

23:14.017 --> 23:18.480
-Um... no, isn't that for Mr. Crane?
-No, he has the sidecar.

23:19.356 --> 23:23.193
-Uh, right. Right you are.
-WAITRESS: Something for you, sir?

23:26.238 --> 23:27.823
No. Thank you.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.160
(clears throat) Well, I guess this is...

23:32.244 --> 23:34.204
I guess this is what they mean
when they say...

23:35.414 --> 23:38.500
-"red-handed", huh?
-Oh, Bob.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.335
No, wait a minute, Frank.
I want you to see something.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.129
I wanna show you something. Hm?

23:45.590 --> 23:46.508
Good luck.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.223
(gulps) Ah.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.353
Where's the lightning, Frank?

23:59.604 --> 24:02.441
Where's the world splitting open
and swallowing me up?

24:03.150 --> 24:04.609
You've kept coming to meetings.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.487
Yeah, well, see,
that's-that's the hypocrisy.

24:07.571 --> 24:11.575
That's... that's what I haven't had
the strength of character to change.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.286
Because, you see, I can handle it.

24:14.369 --> 24:16.872
You've kept coming
because you know that's crap.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.625
You may think you're in control now,
but tomorrow...

24:22.002 --> 24:22.919
next week...

24:23.211 --> 24:28.175
Well, ten months. Ten months of tomorrows.
I can handle it.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.843
We're alcoholics, Bob.

24:31.386 --> 24:32.721
You know how it's gonna end up.

24:32.804 --> 24:36.057
Ah, speak for yourself. I'm no automaton!

24:37.142 --> 24:40.437
No damn organization's gonna write
the script of my life.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.025
Well, at the moment,
you're in bigger trouble than I am.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.779
Play it in "E," Frank. Play it in "E."
Play it with strings.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.073
You have my number if you wanna call.

24:59.039 --> 24:59.873
(sniffles)

25:15.055 --> 25:17.015
I don't want you in the alley.
I want you around the corner on 10th,

25:17.098 --> 25:18.892
covering Bulldog Two and Three.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.686
-You have less than two minutes. Move it.
-(door opens)

25:22.270 --> 25:23.522
How we doin'? We ready?

25:24.147 --> 25:26.066
-(grunts)
-That's what I'm trying to find out.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.027
Bulldog Four, give me your position.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.114
Okay, keep cool. Watch your time.
Yeah. We're ready.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.909
Good. Let's see.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.119
It's two blocks down.
You can't see it from here.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.996
Ah, it's too bad
we can't kick the door in,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.999
throw in a stick of dynamite.
We'd close these places real quick.

25:43.708 --> 25:47.087
-Your people okay about that poor cop?
-Pilsky. They're a little hinky.

25:47.587 --> 25:50.799
Well, this'll be what they need.
We lose a trooper, we get something back.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.842
-(buzzer buzzes)
-Well?

25:53.760 --> 25:57.138
-Yeah. Ready to go.
-All right, let's go.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.726
(tires screeching)

26:01.810 --> 26:03.937
-Hey! It's a bust!
-Hey, you! Stop!

26:05.230 --> 26:07.107
-Hold it right there!
-Don't shoot!

26:07.566 --> 26:08.858
Keep him on that door!

26:11.903 --> 26:13.863
-Okay, freeze! Move! Move!
-Open the door. Come on!

26:14.531 --> 26:15.365
Don't move.

26:15.448 --> 26:16.283
-(door opens)
-Everybody freeze!

26:16.366 --> 26:17.409
(yells)

26:18.285 --> 26:19.119
OFFICER 1: Steel door.

26:19.995 --> 26:20.870
Back it up.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.039
All right, come on. Move it. Let's go.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.125
OFFICER 2:
You have the right to remain silent...

26:25.208 --> 26:26.876
Heroin? Man.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.588
-(sirens wailing)
-Bingo.

26:32.215 --> 26:35.302
Second thoughts on Stop 'N' Cop, Captain,
in light of this successful bust.

26:35.385 --> 26:38.805
-No comment.
-How about in light of your reassignment?

26:39.723 --> 26:40.724
What's he doing here?

26:42.142 --> 26:43.643
What, they don't give you a chance
to get your things?

26:43.727 --> 26:45.478
I didn't mean it to sound that way.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.981
Let me ask you something.
What do you think if we shut down

26:48.064 --> 26:50.900
this, uh, Stop 'N' Cop operation
for a few days

26:50.984 --> 26:53.278
until manpower's up to steam,
what do you think?

26:53.987 --> 26:56.906
You know, I'm gonna be handling
transition here for a few weeks.

26:57.657 --> 26:59.200
I'd really appreciate your input.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.537
-Would you excuse me?
-Oh, sure. Yeah.

27:04.372 --> 27:07.125
Uh, Deputy Chief,
what are the plans with Stop 'N' Cop?

27:07.208 --> 27:09.210
(indistinct chattering)

27:13.256 --> 27:14.090
Come in.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.392
How was first day at Division?

27:25.977 --> 27:28.438
I haven't been there yet. I got this bug.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.982
-You sound a little punk.
-What was all that?

27:32.567 --> 27:35.820
Oh, we got, uh, we got little lucky
on one of the Stop 'N' Cop moves.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.822
-Popped some serious weight.
-Way to go.

27:38.406 --> 27:41.076
-Doesn't help you get your job back.
-That ship sailed, Henry.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.619
LUCY: Her death's on your head.
It's your fault!

27:42.702 --> 27:45.372
-You gave me the order!
-I don't know what you're talking about.

27:45.455 --> 27:46.665
I said, "Pilsky, too?"
I asked specifically!

27:46.748 --> 27:49.542
-I gave you no such order.
-LUCY: Oh, you lying son of a--

27:49.709 --> 27:51.378
-Lucy!
-Walk away, Lucy.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.088
-He's lying.
-Walk away.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.673
-Howard, reporters.
-Um...

27:54.756 --> 27:56.466
I asked him. I asked him!

28:00.345 --> 28:02.722
-That's pathetic.
-Is she telling the truth?

28:02.806 --> 28:06.935
Furillo, I make roster assessments
for 24 turnout sergeants a morning.

28:07.018 --> 28:10.271
I get a fast half-hour to do it
if I get my calls through.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.732
If she's right, she's wrong.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.235
-Which means she's right.
-Meaning I can't remember.

28:16.194 --> 28:19.280
Now, Bates and I can call each other liars
and screw up both our careers,

28:19.364 --> 28:21.408
or we can agree
there was a bureaucratic mix-up

28:21.491 --> 28:23.702
where I authorize a general turnout.

28:23.785 --> 28:27.163
Yes, she asked me if Pilsky was included.
I said everyone was active.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.791
She did not tell me who Pilsky was.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.420
So as long as you still got phantom
feelings in your captaincy, Furillo,

28:33.503 --> 28:34.796
get her to agree to that.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.631
I'll try. Now, I think you better leave--

28:36.715 --> 28:38.758
-I wanna know that she agrees to it.
-I'll call you.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.302
You know I could also romance her
with an open insubordination.

28:41.386 --> 28:42.387
-You know that.
-I'll call.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.402
I have a hard decision for you, Lucy.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.447
-Yeah?
-Briscoe wants the story to IAD

29:00.530 --> 29:02.949
to be that you asked him about Pilsky,

29:03.700 --> 29:06.536
but you didn't identify her
as "officer involved" from the day before.

29:06.619 --> 29:08.455
I did! I told him Pilsky,

29:08.538 --> 29:10.498
the one that was involved
with the shooting! I said it!

29:10.582 --> 29:12.041
He says if you did, it didn't register.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.628
-You think I ought to go along?
-FRANK: I can't tell you to do that.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.006
But I can tell you it'll turn into
his word against yours,

29:18.089 --> 29:19.340
and if that happens, you'll lose.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.762
I should've known it was wrong.
I should've known it was a mistake.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.930
You relayed the order in good conscience.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.391
Yeah, Esterhaus would've known what to do.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.934
Let yourself up, Luce.

29:31.519 --> 29:32.854
What shall I tell Briscoe?

29:37.066 --> 29:37.984
Whatever he wants.

29:42.363 --> 29:44.699
-FAY: Frank?
-FRANK: What, Fay?

29:47.619 --> 29:48.578
I'm sorry.

29:49.370 --> 29:52.332
-How are you doing?
-I've been better.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.502
I know. But have you ever been any worse?

29:55.585 --> 29:57.712
No, sir. No.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.632
I don't believe in disregarding
the chain of command.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.929
Excuse me, Mayor, but it is common
knowledge Chief Daniels reassigned

30:06.012 --> 30:07.222
Captain Furillo at your--

30:09.557 --> 30:10.475
I understand.

30:11.559 --> 30:12.477
I understand.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.272
All right. Thank you for your attention.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.943
-Evidence.
-They want to play hardball, Henry.

30:20.151 --> 30:23.404
-Calletano will play, too.
-No kidding, Lieutenant? What position?

30:25.907 --> 30:28.284
I keep trying to steady myself,
but I can't.

30:32.747 --> 30:34.457
I keep feeling as if I'm drowning.

30:34.541 --> 30:38.002
But it's as if I'm in the middle of the
ocean and there's nothing to grab on to.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.839
Joyce needs me terribly right now.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.717
I can't be there for her. Sound familiar?

30:46.803 --> 30:48.179
Went for a walk last night.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.014
-Oh, Frank. (sighs)
-I didn't drink it.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.224
Had it right there.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.768
Frank, I know you have the strength.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.772
I shouldn't have burdened you with this.

30:58.648 --> 31:01.734
Are you kidding? We have history.

31:05.029 --> 31:05.905
Come here, scooter.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.876
I have to be in court in a few minutes.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.920
The right side of the law this time
one of my welfare mothers.

31:21.421 --> 31:25.758
-Unless you want me to stay.
-No, no. Go. Thanks.

31:34.475 --> 31:37.812
No more of those walks, mister,
or I'll tie your shoelaces together.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.442
(door closes)

31:43.526 --> 31:45.778
FLETCHER: I guess I have to admire
your persistence, Ray.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.448
Do I have to paint "no sale"
across my forehead?

31:49.240 --> 31:52.535
Here is a commercial transaction
I think you will be interested in.

31:58.708 --> 32:02.545
"Big cheese." Empty. Educate me.

32:02.962 --> 32:06.049
It is a tape of you
and the prostitute Whitney Barnes.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.927
You are the "big cheese."

32:10.637 --> 32:13.890
-Where's the videotape?
-In my possession.

32:13.973 --> 32:16.142
I guess that puts all the cards
on the table.

32:16.726 --> 32:17.560
Yes.

32:20.688 --> 32:24.067
-Deal them.
-Frank Furillo gets his job back.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.905
(telephone ringing)

32:30.448 --> 32:31.991
-IAD get your statement?
-Yeah.

32:33.117 --> 32:33.952
Have you seen Lucy?

32:36.371 --> 32:39.624
Look, maybe you wanna come back outside.
Maybe that would be better.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.253
Yeah. I just gotta-- Luce?

32:46.422 --> 32:47.590
I can't talk right now.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.265
Captain, could I bother you
for half a second?

32:56.808 --> 32:57.642
What, Leo?

32:58.184 --> 33:01.229
I know you've been transferred,
but I was wondering if, uh...

33:02.146 --> 33:03.940
cosign a credit union loan application.

33:04.023 --> 33:06.317
-How much?
-Twenty-four hundred.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.404
-New car?
-Baseball camp.

33:10.697 --> 33:13.658
I-It's perfect, Captain.
It falls right on my vacation.

33:14.575 --> 33:15.910
A lot of money for a baseball camp.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.830
No, sir. They give you a room
and three squares a day,

33:18.913 --> 33:20.415
plus all the clinics.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.753
-How are things at home?
-Home's fine, Captain.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.509
Home's over. Mrs. Schnitz is in Vegas.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.219
I wired her all the money.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.764
-She hopes to become a dealer.
-I'm sorry.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.642
So, could you sign?

33:42.437 --> 33:43.563
You know, Captain, uh...

33:44.605 --> 33:46.858
I was a first-string catcher
in high school.

33:47.734 --> 33:50.486
I used to say that aside
from Mrs. Schnitz,

33:50.570 --> 33:53.322
it was the only time in my life
something good happened to me.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.958
Captain, if there's ever anything
that I could do for you.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.835
Uh, could you get me
a few more boxes, Leo?

34:05.918 --> 34:06.878
FLETCHER: Excuse us.

34:12.383 --> 34:13.718
Ozzie's downstairs.

34:14.761 --> 34:16.721
You and I have to come
to an understanding.

34:17.305 --> 34:19.640
-About?
-Don't be coy, Frank.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.185
Ray Calletano's never been more
than your right arm.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.606
Now, I'm gonna have your word
that all copies are destroyed.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.775
I square you downstairs,

34:28.858 --> 34:30.902
we have a clean sheet
top to bottom, agreed?

34:33.196 --> 34:37.158
Ozzie, I've given you fast and full
support in this situation with Frank.

34:37.241 --> 34:39.285
Pin a rose on you, Fletcher.

34:39.368 --> 34:43.039
I'm reminding you of it only because
I don't want my motives confused

34:43.122 --> 34:45.291
when I ask you now to reinstate.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.169
Please, hear me out.

34:48.252 --> 34:52.173
It was my plan to bring Warren Briscoe
in while I arranged a replacement.

34:52.256 --> 34:55.551
Warren's just told me that
he doesn't choose to be considered.

34:56.427 --> 34:59.889
That leaves us looking at a command vacuum
of several weeks duration

35:00.515 --> 35:04.102
in a precinct which has just lost
its turnout sergeant,

35:04.185 --> 35:07.647
and which on its best days
faces the morale problems

35:07.730 --> 35:09.690
concomitant to being this city's armpit.

35:09.774 --> 35:13.820
None of which makes me call you,
Ozzie, if, an hour ago,

35:13.903 --> 35:17.990
Frank Furillo doesn't give me
a very persuasive indication

35:18.074 --> 35:20.993
of just how desperately
he wants another crack at this job.

35:22.453 --> 35:26.374
Frank has asked
for probationary reinstatement.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.295
Given the circumstances,
I'd like your permission to consider it.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.214
You don't need my permission.

35:36.801 --> 35:37.718
Ozzie.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.143
Make your case.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.396
Frank?

35:50.898 --> 35:52.525
I'd very much like another chance.

35:55.319 --> 35:58.948
I realize I was wrong to question policy.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.953
And I'm sorry for the embarrassment
it caused you.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.957
If I get a chance, it won't happen again.

36:13.796 --> 36:16.757
What frosted my butt
was you calling Stop 'N' Cop "politics."

36:18.176 --> 36:19.302
Calling it "trendy."

36:20.178 --> 36:21.804
I grew up on these streets.

36:22.597 --> 36:25.433
I held my brother in my arms
while he died of this poison.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.477
If I made a mistake...

36:30.938 --> 36:33.691
maybe I did encourage
an overcommitment of resources.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.860
It was not to buy popularity.

36:37.069 --> 36:39.822
It would be a probationary
reinstatement, Ozzie.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.786
I think you try to be a good cop, Frank.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.415
Credit me with trying to be a good mayor.

36:52.084 --> 36:52.919
All right.

36:55.838 --> 36:56.672
Thank you.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.343
I'm gonna be a tough
probation officer, Frank.

37:07.516 --> 37:08.809
Every copy.

37:15.024 --> 37:17.276
Let's call it in, huh, guys?
What do you say?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.487
He's got a gun. Let's call it in.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.864
We're three cops here.
How many cops do you want?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.241
He's coming.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.959
-Police! Freeze!
-Hold it, Mullins!

37:33.668 --> 37:35.127
Put it down, Mullins! It's over!

37:35.211 --> 37:37.880
You want me? You want me?

37:37.964 --> 37:39.757
-Drop it!
-Come on!

37:39.840 --> 37:42.635
(gunfire)

38:06.075 --> 38:09.245
Caught my generals, Your Honor.
My gentle parts.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.874
Is this, uh, correct, Mr. Bernstein?

38:14.625 --> 38:18.713
Mr. Burke's... parts
were sucked into a whirlpool drain?

38:20.256 --> 38:22.967
My papers indicate
defendant may have suffered

38:23.050 --> 38:24.176
some provocation, Your Honor.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.429
Some? Some provocation?

38:26.512 --> 38:31.559
How'd you like it? Can you imagine?
You jerk! You amateur! You moron!

38:31.642 --> 38:32.935
-(groans)
-JUDGE: All right, calm down now.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.103
(gavel banging)

38:35.855 --> 38:40.151
What we have here
is a classic crime of passion...

38:41.360 --> 38:47.074
and potentially a monstrously
lucrative civil suit.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.911
But so the judge could make him
do the right thing, is that right?

38:51.704 --> 38:54.790
Claudia, I'm not a lawyer,
so I can't help you with that part of it.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.626
But Ms. Davenport seems to think not.

38:57.710 --> 39:00.421
Why not?
I'm not his common-law or nothing?

39:00.504 --> 39:01.380
Claudia, look.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.842
I think we just have to be
as realistic as possible.

39:04.925 --> 39:08.929
First time we met, I remember you told me
you kept your baby.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.850
(sighs) I wasn't 17,
and it wasn't my first child.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.102
Besides that, I had job skills,

39:15.186 --> 39:17.396
-and I had some money.
-He's got money.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.815
You think all that gang stuff,
he don't have money?

39:20.941 --> 39:21.942
He should marry me.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.695
And what if he won't?

39:26.364 --> 39:28.324
I think you should consider adoption.

39:29.658 --> 39:31.118
I want my baby.

39:32.036 --> 39:36.248
I know. But what we don't know
is whether Jesus wants your baby.

39:37.458 --> 39:38.793
Let me put it to you this way, Jesus,

39:38.876 --> 39:41.128
-there anybody else you'd rather marry?
-Nah.

39:41.212 --> 39:45.424
Then it comes down to your fundamental
basic human freedoms versus slavery.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.220
BAILIFF: Docket N637772, Claudia Ramirez,

39:49.387 --> 39:51.889
illegal possession of a weapon
and attempted murder.

39:52.264 --> 39:53.099
Fay?

39:53.182 --> 39:56.310
Uh, I'm counseling Ms. Ramirez
on her pregnancy, Your Honor.

39:57.436 --> 40:02.483
Uh-huh. I see a felonious attack.
I see a .38 caliber weapon.

40:02.566 --> 40:05.361
Your Honor,
there are extenuating circumstances.

40:05.444 --> 40:08.030
And I see a bun in the oven,

40:08.114 --> 40:11.033
which I take to be the responsibility
of the complainant.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.952
I want to plead the fifth, Your Honor.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.370
Spineless punk.

40:14.453 --> 40:17.832
Yo, Judge!
How about some contempt of court here?

40:17.915 --> 40:20.209
Contempt of life, that's what you are.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.711
Look at this beautiful girl.
Come with me, Claudia.

40:23.045 --> 40:26.006
Come here! Now put your hand on it.

40:27.174 --> 40:30.177
Feel that. You can feel life in there.
It's moving.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.472
But you know what I don't understand?
I do not understand how a man

40:33.556 --> 40:35.516
doesn't love the woman
that's carrying his child.

40:35.599 --> 40:39.728
Yo, who says I don't love her?
'Course I love her.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.522
It feels good when I'm with her.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.984
Then why don't you
drop the charges and marry her?

40:45.734 --> 40:47.319
Who says I ain't gonna marry her?

40:47.778 --> 40:50.614
-Of course I'm gonna marry her.
-All right!

40:50.698 --> 40:52.283
You had a blood test, young man?

40:52.366 --> 40:55.578
Yes, sir. Couple of months ago.
Unrelated incident.

40:55.661 --> 40:59.457
-What? (speaking in Spanish)
-Yo, woman, I passed.

41:00.791 --> 41:04.336
If the parties agree to marry,
will the State drop the gun charge?

41:05.087 --> 41:06.255
Yo.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.716
JUDGE: And do you, Jesus Emilio Martinez,

41:08.799 --> 41:10.759
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife?

41:11.427 --> 41:13.762
-Yeah, I do.
-The ring.

41:14.054 --> 41:16.015
Ring? I ain't got a ring, bro.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.144
RENKO: Uh, excuse me, Judge, sir. Uh...

41:20.227 --> 41:23.189
I think this ought to do you
just fine, Jesus.

41:25.316 --> 41:29.361
-What do you need for this?
-Exactly what I paid for it, $75.

41:30.696 --> 41:31.530
Got you covered.

41:33.365 --> 41:35.326
I now pronounce you man and wife.

41:40.998 --> 41:41.999
(speaking in Spanish)

41:42.625 --> 41:45.419
-(in English) Thank you, Officer.
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

41:48.631 --> 41:49.548
Be happy.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.344
-Cowboy?
-Yeah?

41:53.969 --> 41:58.265
Um, I bought this for Marty. It was, uh,
it was gonna be her birthday present.

41:59.642 --> 42:02.186
I want you to have it.
What you do with it is up to you.

42:09.693 --> 42:10.819
Oh, Bobby Hill.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.710
So, that gonna be it with IAD?

42:27.878 --> 42:29.797
They'll have follow-up questions tomorrow.

42:31.048 --> 42:34.677
-Like what? What kind of questions?
-What's your problem, Garibaldi?

42:35.803 --> 42:37.721
I mean, you act like
you got something to hide.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.766
Look, if we would've busted
that guy the first time,

42:40.849 --> 42:42.810
or even the second time, he'd be alive.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.938
So, what's IAD
gonna say about that, huh?

42:46.313 --> 42:48.107
They're not gonna ask about that.

42:48.607 --> 42:50.276
-What, are you gonna tell them?
-Look, Harry,

42:50.359 --> 42:52.611
didn't you every use discretion
on a possession bust?

42:52.695 --> 42:54.613
The man came out with a piece, Harry.

42:55.447 --> 42:59.159
-He was ordered to disarm. He shot at us.
-I know.

43:00.995 --> 43:02.454
We hunted the guy.

43:02.538 --> 43:04.665
-He was hunting, too.
-Family.

43:05.666 --> 43:09.503
Look, what I know is that the guy
threatened Captain Furillo's wife.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.714
Does that give us permission to kill him?

43:11.797 --> 43:13.757
Look, you gotta understand something, kid.

43:14.508 --> 43:17.219
We stayed on that guys back,
we gave him a chance to make a mistake,

43:17.303 --> 43:19.221
but he made it, it was his choice.

43:19.471 --> 43:22.808
And he could've come in, right?
You gave him a chance to drop his weapon.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.185
Convict yourself
of what's in your heart, Harry,

43:25.269 --> 43:26.812
you're not gonna make a cop, man.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.481
You'll have violence in your heart...
a lot.

43:43.162 --> 43:44.038
(sighs)

43:53.339 --> 43:55.883
-Detective?
-Ms. Davenport.

43:56.550 --> 43:59.553
Uh... part of me wants to ask
what happened.

44:00.471 --> 44:03.140
-What's that?
-How William Mullins died.

44:05.059 --> 44:10.439
He'd just robbed a liquor store.
He was armed, resisted arrest.

44:11.106 --> 44:14.318
-He shot at you.
-Uh-huh.

44:16.362 --> 44:20.449
-I'm-I'm sorry for asking you that.
-It's okay.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.994
-(whispers) Oh, God.
-It's all right.

44:25.079 --> 44:25.996
Thank you.

44:28.207 --> 44:30.918
-Hey, hey. Take it easy. It's okay.
-Yeah.

44:33.796 --> 44:35.214
You got a friend here to see you.

44:56.193 --> 44:58.195
Hm. Daryl Ann?

44:58.278 --> 45:00.072
-What?
-Uh...

45:04.243 --> 45:07.621
(sighs) Daryl Ann, Daryl Ann...

45:07.955 --> 45:09.707
Whatever it is, just say it.

45:11.875 --> 45:16.588
Um... do you think that you,
um, would marry me?

45:17.005 --> 45:19.508
(chuckles)
Well, I already said that I would.

45:21.176 --> 45:25.097
Well... then, um...

45:26.849 --> 45:29.935
You mean this is it? You're asking me?

45:31.854 --> 45:35.315
I figure I have to,
or else what would I do with this?

45:40.112 --> 45:40.988
(chuckles)

45:43.157 --> 45:46.827
Oh, Andy, it's beautiful.
I can't believe it.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.831
I thought you were gonna give me
the boot as sure as anything.

45:53.751 --> 45:54.668
I thought about it.

45:56.170 --> 46:01.216
Then I decided any man
that would give you up...

46:01.967 --> 46:03.635
ought to have his head examined.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.471
I love you, Andy Renko.

46:06.054 --> 46:09.016
And I love you, future Mrs. Andy Renko.

46:12.186 --> 46:14.688
-Are you as scared as I am?
-(Daryl Ann sniffles)

46:17.316 --> 46:18.150
(whispers) Yeah.

46:25.699 --> 46:29.077
-You sure you want it back?
-I was surprised how much.

46:33.540 --> 46:35.459
I stood in that station house today...

46:36.960 --> 46:40.672
and I looked at that decent, kind man,
knowing what he'd done for me.

46:42.466 --> 46:44.676
Everything I hear
says that went by the book.

46:47.471 --> 46:51.266
I looked at Washington,
and I felt... (sighs)

46:53.060 --> 46:55.854
I thought of all the decent people
working in that precinct

46:56.897 --> 46:59.858
doing terrible things
because their jobs made them.

47:00.776 --> 47:03.695
I hated where I was standing.
I hated that station house.

47:09.701 --> 47:10.702
Oh, Frank.

47:15.958 --> 47:17.835
(sniffles) I need you.

47:19.878 --> 47:23.382
I need us back together so much.

47:26.510 --> 47:28.595
-We have been separate.
-(chuckles)

47:31.557 --> 47:33.308
Ever think it might not be our fault?

47:34.977 --> 47:36.186
It's the damn work.

47:37.312 --> 47:40.732
(sighs) The damn world we work in.

47:43.569 --> 47:44.403
(sniffles)

47:48.073 --> 47:49.449
I nearly took a drink today.

47:54.913 --> 47:56.915
You know anyone who wants
a fifth of hooch?

47:58.125 --> 47:59.042
(laughs)

48:02.045 --> 48:03.380
Trade? (sniffles)

48:05.132 --> 48:10.345
You could always use another gun,
and I could sure use a belt. (chuckles)

48:24.276 --> 48:27.279
(closing theme playing)
