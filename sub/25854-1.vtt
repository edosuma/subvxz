WEBVTT

00:45.666 --> 00:46.701
My name is Nathan.

00:48.565 --> 00:50.740
It's my last birthday.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.965
Please, please don't
cake me in the face.

01:10.449 --> 01:12.795
I know you all want to,
but please for me, today,

01:12.796 --> 01:14.212
please don't.

01:23.773 --> 01:24.911
Yes!

01:24.912 --> 01:26.086
Yes! Yes!

01:49.385 --> 01:50.800
Oh there's lots of cake.

01:52.008 --> 01:53.216
I thought I got it.

02:06.574 --> 02:08.437
Come on, let's get some food.

02:23.695 --> 02:25.558
There's this thing
called a fault.

02:25.559 --> 02:29.355
That fault is like where
earthquakes and volcanoes

02:29.356 --> 02:30.356
are mostly.

02:31.323 --> 02:32.152
I'll be right back.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.014
You alright?

02:33.014 --> 02:33.843
Yeah.

02:33.843 --> 02:34.671
In common.

02:34.672 --> 02:35.844
That's scary.

02:35.845 --> 02:37.225
Scary I know.

02:37.226 --> 02:38.054
That's scary
stuff, does that scare you?

02:38.055 --> 02:39.297
Yeah, it scares me.

02:40.470 --> 02:41.746
There you are.

02:41.747 --> 02:42.748
Here I am.

02:44.888 --> 02:45.957
Don't.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.269
What?

02:47.270 --> 02:48.547
Ask me how I'm doing.

02:51.101 --> 02:52.448
Thank you man.

02:53.863 --> 02:55.346
I know it's been tough.

02:55.347 --> 02:58.453
I haven't exactly
been much help.

02:58.454 --> 03:00.456
Hey man, no one expects you to.

03:01.422 --> 03:02.422
Where's Adele?

03:05.599 --> 03:07.669
She didn't think
she could handle it.

03:07.670 --> 03:08.533
You know.

03:08.534 --> 03:10.017
Yeah well, I get it.

03:12.640 --> 03:13.640
Marry her.

03:15.471 --> 03:16.471
Trust me.

03:18.957 --> 03:22.028
That's it, you're a natural,
now get it back there now.

03:22.029 --> 03:23.409
Let me do it.

03:23.410 --> 03:24.962
No way.

03:24.963 --> 03:26.998
You've got Ethan you can
get away, I want to do it.

03:26.999 --> 03:27.828
No!

03:27.828 --> 03:28.656
Come on man!

03:28.656 --> 03:29.485
No!

03:29.486 --> 03:30.588
Let me do.

03:30.589 --> 03:31.762
No.

03:31.763 --> 03:32.763
I love you Jack.

03:50.816 --> 03:54.267
Do you want to know
about the cake?

03:54.268 --> 03:55.268
I'm sorry.

03:58.168 --> 03:58.997
Fucker.

03:58.997 --> 03:59.963
We had to man.

03:59.964 --> 04:01.204
Come on let's go get a drink.

04:11.596 --> 04:13.873
But he's just like this
in the room and I can't,

04:13.874 --> 04:16.807
and I'm literally looking
for him in every room.

04:16.808 --> 04:17.636
The pants swap, that
was the pants swap day.

04:17.637 --> 04:19.293
Yes you do.

04:20.432 --> 04:21.673
My pants, my dad's pants.

04:21.675 --> 04:23.227
I'm glad I got
to see all these photos

04:23.228 --> 04:24.471
of you with your shirt off.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.267
Hi guys,

04:30.994 --> 04:34.135
Ethan has something that he
would like to say for Nathan.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.067
So.

04:51.394 --> 04:53.465
Chris do you
mind if I sit there?

04:55.502 --> 04:56.502
Thanks man.

04:58.953 --> 05:01.059
It's my father's birthday.

05:06.996 --> 05:09.239
It's usually a happy
day, but today it isn't.

05:10.482 --> 05:12.139
Today is different.

05:13.727 --> 05:16.695
Today he's leaving and
that makes me really sad.

05:18.939 --> 05:20.906
But I know he's doing
it for all of us.

05:22.045 --> 05:24.046
I know that he's strong
and that he's brave,

05:24.047 --> 05:25.739
and he wants to
stay but he can't.

05:28.086 --> 05:31.330
And I want him to know
how proud I am of him.

05:31.331 --> 05:36.336
I want him to know that I'm
proud of being your son.

05:37.751 --> 05:39.545
And I want him to know
that I will not throw away

05:39.546 --> 05:41.132
anything he's given me.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.929
I will not throw away
the chance he's given me.

05:45.345 --> 05:49.832
The future, I will be the
future he wants for me.

06:07.953 --> 06:09.057
Hey.

06:09.058 --> 06:10.369
Hey.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.510
I didn't think I'd
see you before I left.

06:13.511 --> 06:14.684
I know.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.902
I'm sorry I never
called you back.

06:26.903 --> 06:28.284
No, I get it.

06:31.218 --> 06:33.737
I wasn't sure if I
was going to come or not.

06:33.738 --> 06:36.396
Yeah, no, I know.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.749
I'm so happy to see you.

06:46.129 --> 06:47.407
Me too.

06:51.169 --> 06:52.411
Do you know what I think about

06:52.412 --> 06:53.551
when I think about you?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.763
I think about kissing you.

07:00.937 --> 07:03.146
In the cabin that
summer by the lake.

07:08.980 --> 07:09.980
I'm sorry Cat.

07:12.362 --> 07:14.123
I'm so sorry for everything.

07:15.193 --> 07:16.712
It was a long time ago.

07:21.026 --> 07:22.925
I still don't forgive you.

07:25.410 --> 07:27.307
Well I guess
I have delivered that.

07:27.308 --> 07:29.033
Not for much longer.

07:29.034 --> 07:30.829
Oh fuck.

07:31.934 --> 07:33.280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.493
So I got married.

07:42.185 --> 07:43.463
That's amazing.

07:44.947 --> 07:46.051
Well good for you Cat.

07:48.778 --> 07:49.779
Well is he nice?

07:51.298 --> 07:54.403
Yes, you would like him.

07:54.404 --> 07:56.372
Mm, I doubt that.

08:01.204 --> 08:02.723
Now you think you'll have kids?

08:08.591 --> 08:09.591
I don't know yet.

08:11.629 --> 08:12.629
You should.

08:17.393 --> 08:18.705
I should've married you.

08:22.156 --> 08:23.156
Yeah.

08:25.125 --> 08:29.785
I should have done
a lot of things, I tried.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.443
No Nathan, you didn't.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.518
Yeah.

08:41.381 --> 08:42.970
I wasted so much fucking time.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.558
And now it's gone.

08:48.113 --> 08:50.564
I always thought I was
gonna do all these things.

08:52.014 --> 08:53.498
And I ended up doing nothing.

08:54.775 --> 08:55.949
You have Ethan.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.611
I can't even look
him in the eye anymore.

09:03.612 --> 09:04.612
Why?

09:08.237 --> 09:09.272
I'm scared Cat.

09:12.034 --> 09:13.311
I'm so fucking scared.

09:17.315 --> 09:19.075
I wish I had more time.

09:21.768 --> 09:23.459
I just wasted so
much fucking time.

09:32.744 --> 09:33.744
Shh.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.540
I love you, I love you.

09:36.541 --> 09:37.541
I love you.

09:46.275 --> 09:49.242
But you can't run from this.

09:49.243 --> 09:52.005
This is the thing
you have to do.

09:53.834 --> 09:57.182
It's breaking my
heart but you have to.

11:43.564 --> 11:46.808
Congratulations, it's
your 40th birthday.

11:46.809 --> 11:48.535
Welcome to the Seed Initiative.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.054
We sincerely thank
you for complying

11:51.055 --> 11:52.883
with the population code.

11:52.884 --> 11:55.437
Your sacrifice ensures that
future generations have access

11:55.438 --> 11:58.095
to the same peaceful
and sustainable world

11:58.096 --> 12:00.857
you were afforded
by those before you.

12:00.858 --> 12:02.272
We understand how
difficult this day

12:02.273 --> 12:04.688
can be for you and your family.

12:04.689 --> 12:07.726
But rest assured once you've
seeded they will receive

12:07.727 --> 12:10.142
the full support of our agency.

12:10.143 --> 12:12.938
We will take care of them
as if they were our own.

12:12.939 --> 12:14.802
They will not be forgotten.

12:14.803 --> 12:16.769
You're scared right now.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.220
I know what you're
thinking, everyone does,

12:19.221 --> 12:23.743
but remember balance will be
maintained one way or another.

12:25.054 --> 12:27.470
Be honorable, be brave.

12:29.507 --> 12:31.266
There's nothing to be afraid of.

12:31.267 --> 12:34.925
Simply put this in your
mouth and take one breath.

12:34.926 --> 12:36.031
What could be simpler?

12:37.135 --> 12:39.862
One breath and you
save everyone you love.

12:41.036 --> 12:43.934
One breath and you
give them a future.

12:43.935 --> 12:47.318
One breath and you
plant your seed.

14:24.553 --> 14:26.554
Hi Jane thank you
so much for your patience.

14:26.555 --> 14:27.796
Of course.

14:27.797 --> 14:29.937
I'm Dr. Jack Benton,
I work with Dr. Stephens

14:29.938 --> 14:32.525
and I'll be doing your
final paperwork today.

14:32.526 --> 14:35.563
Full disclosure, there's a lot.

14:35.564 --> 14:37.013
I assumed.

14:37.014 --> 14:40.016
First, there will be
the risk analysis profile

14:40.017 --> 14:42.984
and this stack here
and then this batch

14:42.985 --> 14:43.985
here.

14:46.092 --> 14:47.092
Everything okay?

14:48.266 --> 14:49.508
Yeah.

14:49.509 --> 14:51.269
I know there's a lot.

14:53.478 --> 14:54.754
Let me know if
you need anything.

14:54.755 --> 14:59.760
Thank you.

15:03.488 --> 15:04.937
She left me okay?

15:04.938 --> 15:06.905
We hear this lady screaming
at the top of her lungs.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.804
I was just trying to
get my ass back to work.

15:09.805 --> 15:11.495
She like runs off okay and then

15:11.496 --> 15:13.187
I turn around, out of
nowhere, I'm freaking out

15:13.188 --> 15:15.465
because this woman just
comes up to me and asked me

15:15.466 --> 15:16.638
can I watch her baby?

15:16.639 --> 15:19.296
Like first of all
where is your stroller?

15:19.297 --> 15:20.849
Can you watch my baby?

15:20.850 --> 15:23.507
I mean doesn't even wait for
me that respond or anything,

15:23.508 --> 15:26.752
she just hands me her actual
baby and runs after the guy.

15:26.753 --> 15:27.856
Hold on, did you actually

15:27.857 --> 15:29.134
see the guy that
took her wallet?

15:29.135 --> 15:30.101
No, absolutely not.

15:30.102 --> 15:31.377
I mean me and Jane

15:31.378 --> 15:32.172
we're just coming back
from our lunch break.

15:32.173 --> 15:33.621
That's actually true.

15:33.622 --> 15:34.450
Yes, it's actually
true, yes that's the one,

15:34.451 --> 15:36.245
you weren't even there.

15:37.695 --> 15:39.075
I'm just watching this
newborn like out of nowhere.

15:39.076 --> 15:41.111
That is so scary I
don't know how anybody

15:41.112 --> 15:42.492
raises kids in the city.

15:42.493 --> 15:44.701
What am I supposed to do okay?

15:44.702 --> 15:45.944
Yeah, what do you think
she wanted you to do?

15:45.945 --> 15:49.741
Breastfeed it, change
it's diaper, tickle it?

15:50.708 --> 15:52.296
My girls.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.642
I'm so happy you're both here.

15:54.643 --> 15:55.885
Me too.

15:57.957 --> 15:58.958
Where's Kurt?

16:00.373 --> 16:02.892
He's with the boys,
you'll see him tomorrow.

16:04.791 --> 16:09.208
Word around town is that dad
has himself a lady friend.

16:09.209 --> 16:10.727
What?

16:10.728 --> 16:13.350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't
actually confirm anything

16:13.351 --> 16:15.421
because he won't tell
me anything, but.

16:15.422 --> 16:16.975
Huh, is she hot?

16:16.976 --> 16:20.771
Oh very classy
ladies I've raised, now does

16:20.772 --> 16:22.497
it matter if she's hot?

16:22.498 --> 16:24.328
See, see, you admit
it, there's a she.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.021
To lady Jane.

16:33.751 --> 16:36.615
When you moved to this
block it changed my life.

16:36.616 --> 16:38.099
I got a best friend.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.619
Yeah, but she's my best friend.

16:40.861 --> 16:43.830
Shit, this is my toast!

16:45.970 --> 16:47.210
Plus I've known her way longer.

16:50.664 --> 16:52.597
Any surgical team is
lucky to have you.

16:53.909 --> 16:55.254
Even if that means
you're off somewhere

16:55.255 --> 16:58.845
doctoring without
borders and fighting off

17:00.019 --> 17:01.295
the diseases,

17:01.296 --> 17:02.744
The diseases?

17:02.745 --> 17:03.987
And the
mosquitoes, and the glaciers.

17:03.988 --> 17:07.611
This is where I
take over this toast

17:07.612 --> 17:09.338
and simply say

17:10.546 --> 17:11.546
Janie,

17:13.066 --> 17:14.999
oh, she hates this so much.

17:18.865 --> 17:21.902
Safe travels, come back soon.

17:24.595 --> 17:25.836
Cheers.

17:25.837 --> 17:26.631
Here here.

17:26.632 --> 17:27.805
Here here.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.363
Doing okay in here?

17:37.435 --> 17:38.505
Mostly.

17:40.369 --> 17:41.887
Although I was told that I had

17:41.888 --> 17:45.547
the option of an anonymity
contract if I so chose?

17:47.549 --> 17:51.380
Yes, yes, that is an option.

17:52.795 --> 17:55.280
You do know though there'll
be no method of contact?

17:55.281 --> 17:56.281
Perfect.

18:03.012 --> 18:04.220
Jane you're lying because

18:04.221 --> 18:05.842
you could never
hold your liquor.

18:05.843 --> 18:07.637
She jumped throwing
this guy's back okay?

18:07.638 --> 18:09.605
And he's spinning her
around and I'm so it, and.

18:12.401 --> 18:13.746
This had better be an emergency

18:13.747 --> 18:15.023
because I told you
to only call me

18:15.024 --> 18:17.165
in emergencies, what is it?

18:18.476 --> 18:19.305
It's work.

18:19.305 --> 18:20.237
I know.

18:20.238 --> 18:21.444
You need get it together,

18:21.445 --> 18:22.885
put on your big girl
fucking panties.

18:23.723 --> 18:24.723
Uh oh.

18:30.661 --> 18:31.661
You've been quiet.

18:33.491 --> 18:34.491
Yeah.

18:37.323 --> 18:39.496
So this job is there like
a visitor situation or?

18:39.497 --> 18:41.843
No, it's not like that.

18:41.844 --> 18:43.742
Hmm.

18:43.743 --> 18:44.743
What?

18:46.608 --> 18:48.160
What?

18:48.161 --> 18:49.506
What was that hmm?

18:49.507 --> 18:50.336
Hmm.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.853
Hmm.

18:51.854 --> 18:53.786
Hmm, it's just a noise
people do it all the time.

18:53.787 --> 18:55.029
Make noises.

18:55.030 --> 18:56.582
Everything that you
do means something.

18:56.583 --> 18:59.276
I think that I've at least
figured that out about you.

19:01.726 --> 19:02.761
I don't know.

19:02.762 --> 19:04.142
What?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.213
Say it, Jesus.

19:06.214 --> 19:07.525
Stay.

19:08.354 --> 19:09.354
Okay.

19:10.425 --> 19:12.978
I'm serious, stay.

19:12.979 --> 19:13.979
Why?

19:16.845 --> 19:18.294
Because.

19:18.295 --> 19:20.193
Oh, okay.

19:25.716 --> 19:26.716
No,

19:28.063 --> 19:28.995
no.

19:28.995 --> 19:29.927
No what?

19:29.927 --> 19:30.893
I don't know, don't tell me.

19:30.894 --> 19:32.342
What?

19:32.343 --> 19:34.482
Don't tell me this is like,
is this like a confession

19:34.483 --> 19:36.415
of like your love?

19:36.416 --> 19:37.245
I don't know.

19:37.246 --> 19:38.246
My love?

19:38.247 --> 19:39.556
Jesus Christ.

19:39.557 --> 19:42.801
I told you I loved you
once in the third grade.

19:42.802 --> 19:44.285
Fair.

19:44.286 --> 19:45.700
And you can't let it go, you
just keep thinking about it.

19:45.701 --> 19:46.944
No, I'm letting it.

19:48.325 --> 19:49.704
You know I thought I was
Spider-Man in the third grade.

19:49.705 --> 19:50.947
You did.

19:50.948 --> 19:51.880
I thought I was
actually Spider-Man.

19:51.880 --> 19:52.536
It was so weird.

19:52.536 --> 19:53.536
It was fun.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.573
I didn't stop a lot of bad guys.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.921
I ate actual worms
until the fourth grade.

19:59.922 --> 20:01.854
I did a lot of things in
elementary school that.

20:01.855 --> 20:02.684
You're not proud of?

20:02.685 --> 20:03.718
I don't do now.

20:03.719 --> 20:05.169
What? I'm proud of all of it.

20:06.308 --> 20:09.345
And I'm with Sarah now also, so.

20:09.346 --> 20:10.346
Right,

20:11.244 --> 20:12.244
yeah.

20:13.660 --> 20:16.006
You were just making this face.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.249
What face?

20:17.250 --> 20:19.424
I don't know like this
love face or something?

20:19.425 --> 20:22.012
A love face, okay
what the fuck is that?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.981
I don't know, it's just,

20:25.500 --> 20:26.500
erase.

20:32.403 --> 20:34.853
I just can't imagine
you not being a drive away

20:34.854 --> 20:36.821
or even a phone call away.

20:41.067 --> 20:42.067
I,

20:44.208 --> 20:45.209
I like count on you.

20:50.904 --> 20:51.904
I like know.

20:56.910 --> 20:59.222
It's fine, you'll be fine.

20:59.223 --> 21:00.810
I don't care okay?

21:00.811 --> 21:02.570
Only call me if you die, okay?

21:02.571 --> 21:04.159
Bye, goodbye.

21:05.540 --> 21:06.368
Should I?

21:06.368 --> 21:07.231
Yeah, you're good.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.129
Stay yeah, you're good.

21:50.585 --> 21:51.585
Hi.

21:53.415 --> 21:54.415
Hey.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.315
You need something?

22:02.355 --> 22:03.563
Ditching your own party?

22:05.565 --> 22:06.670
Something like that.

22:07.843 --> 22:08.810
I can go if want?

22:08.811 --> 22:10.018
No you're fine.

22:13.193 --> 22:15.263
Do you like living with dad?

22:15.264 --> 22:16.506
Yeah, it's fine.

22:16.507 --> 22:17.887
You know you don't have to.

22:17.888 --> 22:19.337
I know.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.959
No, I'm just, I'm saying
that that you can do

22:20.960 --> 22:23.064
whatever you want, you know?

22:23.065 --> 22:24.895
Whatever, makes you happy.

22:26.068 --> 22:30.072
I just want you to be
able to be yourself.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.350
Whatever that is.

22:37.977 --> 22:39.668
How's that working out for you?

22:40.980 --> 22:42.361
You are such a dick.

22:47.227 --> 22:48.159
Seriously, how is your life?

22:48.160 --> 22:49.712
What do you mean?

22:49.713 --> 22:52.922
I don't know, I feel like I
love you and I don't know you.

22:52.923 --> 22:57.893
And I'm just trying to
understand you and like.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.413
Relax.

23:02.242 --> 23:03.242
Things are fine.

23:04.072 --> 23:06.073
I mean school sucks.

23:06.074 --> 23:08.041
Community college
is lame, shocker.

23:09.457 --> 23:11.906
Mostly I just go to work and
hang out with my friends.

23:11.907 --> 23:15.463
I don't know, I don't
really have a lot to say.

23:17.085 --> 23:19.328
Okay, cool.

23:22.228 --> 23:23.228
I'm not you.

23:24.092 --> 23:26.231
Oh yeah?

23:26.232 --> 23:29.960
Yeah, I'm good here I don't
need to go do some crazy shit.

23:39.141 --> 23:41.143
Do you mind if I
sit here for a while?

23:42.697 --> 23:43.767
Knock yourself out.

24:01.612 --> 24:02.889
That's better.

24:06.686 --> 24:07.686
Oh sorry.

24:09.033 --> 24:11.483
It's been more than two
hours of dotting and signing.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.968
An apology's a bit
unnecessary at this point.

24:13.969 --> 24:16.247
It's an honor to meet
you in person actually.

24:19.078 --> 24:21.148
I read your application letter.

24:21.149 --> 24:23.702
In the yellow and
blue of our days.

24:23.703 --> 24:26.464
That was from my
mom's favorite song.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.674
Honestly your work on
biomedical nanotechnology,

24:29.675 --> 24:31.607
it's such a huge achievement.

24:31.608 --> 24:33.505
And the innovative way you
used that in each round

24:33.506 --> 24:35.438
of the selection process.

24:35.439 --> 24:37.889
Having your level of expertise
on board, it's really,

24:37.890 --> 24:39.512
it's all the team
can talk about.

24:40.893 --> 24:41.997
You fit right in Jane.

24:45.035 --> 24:46.485
I don't know how
to say thank you.

24:47.451 --> 24:48.451
You just say it.

24:49.384 --> 24:50.385
Thank you.

25:09.335 --> 25:10.818
Bourbon?

25:10.819 --> 25:11.819
Hmm.

25:17.964 --> 25:19.551
Your friends leave?

25:19.552 --> 25:20.552
I think so.

25:27.491 --> 25:28.491
How's the old arm?

25:41.609 --> 25:45.474
What do you think mom
is doing like right now?

25:49.858 --> 25:50.858
Probably

25:53.482 --> 25:58.487
riding a gold plated bike in
circles through purgatory.

25:59.212 --> 26:00.386
Pissing everyone off.

26:02.388 --> 26:06.426
The madwoman
cackling maniacally,

26:07.738 --> 26:09.775
singing at the top of her lungs.

26:11.086 --> 26:15.296
♪ I was a victim of a
series of accidents ♪

26:15.297 --> 26:17.990
♪ As are we all

26:27.482 --> 26:28.482
I miss her.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.801
I should say that more.

26:37.630 --> 26:38.735
She'd understand.

26:40.426 --> 26:41.634
Understand what?

26:43.015 --> 26:44.603
Whatever's going on with you.

26:48.089 --> 26:49.779
Dad I'm fine.

26:49.780 --> 26:54.613
Jane, I just
want to know you're okay.

26:56.338 --> 26:58.616
No one's really okay.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.617
Janie.

27:03.311 --> 27:07.522
This is the best fine
that I'm gonna be, okay?

27:09.662 --> 27:10.662
Deal with it.

27:13.493 --> 27:14.493
Okay.

27:16.635 --> 27:20.016
You're my kid let me worry
about you for Christ's sake.

27:20.017 --> 27:21.293
No.

27:21.294 --> 27:22.536
Worry about Bobby.

27:22.537 --> 27:24.021
I think his shirts
are too tight.

27:25.229 --> 27:26.402
I'm serious I think
they're cutting

27:26.403 --> 27:27.818
off the circulation
to his brain.

27:30.303 --> 27:33.651
Yeah, I'll hijack his laundry

27:33.652 --> 27:34.859
it's not like he's gonna do it.

27:34.860 --> 27:36.447
Just burn them.

27:46.630 --> 27:48.528
You did everything
you could for us.

27:50.082 --> 27:51.082
Always.

27:54.603 --> 27:55.984
I don't know about that.

27:59.091 --> 28:00.091
You did.

28:01.783 --> 28:02.783
Okay?

28:05.545 --> 28:06.685
Just know that.

29:09.609 --> 29:13.164
This what I think it is?

29:13.165 --> 29:14.717
We have the contract here.

29:14.718 --> 29:16.995
And I'm gonna go
over each section

29:16.996 --> 29:21.517
so that you know what
you're opting for.

29:21.518 --> 29:22.760
So what?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.278
You're just gonna
call us up one day

29:24.279 --> 29:27.281
and say you're leaving
for some obscure job

29:27.282 --> 29:28.732
for God knows how long?

29:29.871 --> 29:32.873
Do us the I don't know
courtesy of coming home

29:32.874 --> 29:35.324
for a day just to
leave a fucking note

29:35.325 --> 29:37.015
and vanish at the crack of dawn?

29:37.016 --> 29:40.053
Alice, please don't do this.

29:40.054 --> 29:41.640
Me, me don't do this.

29:41.641 --> 29:42.814
Yes.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.989
Jane this is you,
this is all you.

29:44.990 --> 29:46.300
It's what you do.

29:46.301 --> 29:47.888
You walk in and out of our lives

29:47.889 --> 29:49.821
like we're not
supposed to love you

29:49.822 --> 29:52.030
or care if you're here,
or care if you're not.

29:52.031 --> 29:53.445
But we do.

29:53.446 --> 29:55.654
Get it through
your fucking head.

29:55.655 --> 29:58.934
I can't do this, I can't.

29:58.935 --> 29:59.867
Can't what?

29:59.868 --> 30:02.593
I can't, I can't breathe.

30:05.320 --> 30:08.116
I wish that I knew
how to help you.

30:11.602 --> 30:13.362
You can't.

30:13.363 --> 30:14.363
Why?

30:18.575 --> 30:19.576
I think I'm not.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.735
Am I gonna see you again?

30:45.257 --> 30:47.397
I don't think so.

31:11.283 --> 31:14.595
Here we have section
one, that's full anonymity.

31:14.596 --> 31:16.183
That means that apart from us

31:16.184 --> 31:17.702
and your government no
one will have access

31:17.703 --> 31:20.360
to your involvement
in the project.

31:20.361 --> 31:24.019
Option two, anonymity
until departure.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.297
That means any press coverage,

31:26.298 --> 31:28.230
any media that's released
within the next year

31:28.231 --> 31:31.440
until you depart, your
identity will be withheld.

31:31.441 --> 31:36.446
And then option three, that's
anonymity until arrival

31:37.033 --> 31:38.033
or complication.

31:38.758 --> 31:40.380
I'm guessing that's what
you're gonna choose.

31:40.381 --> 31:42.003
I'm sorry you're guessing?

31:45.386 --> 31:49.113
Yes, I am and I shouldn't

31:49.114 --> 31:50.114
speculate.

31:52.393 --> 31:53.703
It's just that you're the
first person I've ever had

31:53.704 --> 31:55.603
use this particular contract.

31:59.020 --> 32:02.678
What I was gonna say
is that I'm guessing

32:02.679 --> 32:04.128
this is the option
someone would use

32:04.129 --> 32:07.959
if they did want to relay
status to family and next of kin

32:07.960 --> 32:11.308
when you've reached
some sort of finality.

32:13.621 --> 32:16.140
I'll let you make your
decision and step out.

32:16.141 --> 32:20.144
Oh, I'm fine.

32:20.145 --> 32:23.769
Fantastic we are done.

32:24.770 --> 32:25.770
Finally.

32:27.048 --> 32:29.982
I would like to officially
welcome you aboard.

32:30.879 --> 32:32.777
Congratulations Jane.

32:32.778 --> 32:35.781
You are the newest member of
the Mars One Astronaut Program.

32:38.025 --> 32:40.096
How does it feel to
be an actual pioneer?

32:42.788 --> 32:43.788
It's.

33:42.089 --> 33:43.124
It's.

34:31.931 --> 34:34.244
Come on, come on, come on.

34:37.730 --> 34:38.730
Come on.

34:40.664 --> 34:42.355
What the hell man?

34:42.356 --> 34:44.909
We tried to get the jet.

34:52.331 --> 34:55.438
Do you see what's
going on down here?

34:59.373 --> 35:02.547
And they don't even know
what's really coming.

35:02.548 --> 35:04.101
You gotta take me with you.

35:04.102 --> 35:08.105
Just go to a shelter
like everybody else.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.487
Come on Doug, don't play me.

35:11.868 --> 35:13.318
What are you talking about?

35:14.836 --> 35:16.183
I know where you're going.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.328
Sarah told me about
your little secret.

35:24.984 --> 35:26.641
Then you know I can't help you.

35:29.057 --> 35:30.335
Are you kidding me?

35:32.130 --> 35:35.270
Are you kidding me?

35:35.271 --> 35:36.271
Sarah!

35:37.065 --> 35:39.067
We can't leave him behind.

35:40.034 --> 35:42.554
You can't do this to me Doug.

35:46.213 --> 35:48.938
Would you just for once?

35:48.939 --> 35:50.906
I'm your brother!

35:50.907 --> 35:51.907
Goodbye.

35:52.564 --> 35:53.564
What are you doing?

35:54.842 --> 35:56.394
Be ready to go to

35:56.395 --> 35:59.432
your destination
in five minutes.

35:59.433 --> 36:04.265
If you want to survive you
gonna have to make some hard.

36:59.044 --> 37:00.908
The signs were everywhere.

37:01.978 --> 37:06.189
Hunger, pollution, epidemics.

37:07.432 --> 37:10.296
After a century of a
reckless consumption

37:10.297 --> 37:13.265
civilization was about to
collapse under its own weight.

37:15.163 --> 37:17.441
Still I had faith
humanity would finally

37:17.442 --> 37:19.546
work together hand
in hand to overcome

37:19.547 --> 37:23.379
the greed and selfishness
that was tearing us apart.

37:25.657 --> 37:29.247
But in the end those in
power chose a different path.

37:30.869 --> 37:34.459
The same they always had, war.

37:35.839 --> 37:39.360
And when it was over
all we had left was

37:42.260 --> 37:43.260
each other.

37:49.094 --> 37:51.406
For over a year now we've been
heading to a survivor colony

37:51.407 --> 37:52.511
out west.

37:55.859 --> 37:57.482
But it's still a long way to go.

39:31.127 --> 39:32.369
Are you sure you're okay?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.992
I'm fine.

39:52.976 --> 39:54.357
How's she doing?

39:55.634 --> 39:56.634
Not good.

39:57.843 --> 39:59.397
You're gonna have to slow down.

40:01.019 --> 40:02.019
Not a chance.

40:04.816 --> 40:07.334
We can barely make
it to the next town.

40:07.335 --> 40:09.165
That's if we keep our pace.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.762
What is it Henry?

40:27.597 --> 40:29.288
Thank you.

40:32.499 --> 40:33.499
Alright.

40:58.076 --> 41:00.629
And now ladies and gentlemen.

41:00.630 --> 41:03.770
Please welcome Wall
Street's rising star.

41:03.771 --> 41:05.323
Hey Warren!

41:05.324 --> 41:09.605
Get your head out of your
ass man, it's dinner time.

41:17.613 --> 41:19.097
What's with the mystery meal?

41:22.997 --> 41:27.967
I know this journey's been
longer than a son a bitch but

41:27.968 --> 41:31.696
today is actually an
auspicious occasion.

41:33.387 --> 41:34.561
1,000 miles.

41:35.872 --> 41:36.872
The halfway point,

41:37.874 --> 41:39.462
wa la.

41:42.430 --> 41:44.017
Where did you get a cake?

41:44.018 --> 41:44.881
Wow.

41:44.882 --> 41:47.574
Actually Gus here did.

41:49.023 --> 41:51.819
He thought it'd be a good
way to cheer y'all up.

41:53.407 --> 41:54.407
Gus?

41:56.962 --> 41:58.964
Is that a heartbeat I'm hearing?

42:01.035 --> 42:06.006
Now before we dig in I thought

42:07.594 --> 42:10.631
it'd be good to have a
couple of words, Claire.

42:12.909 --> 42:14.117
Won't you say something?

42:15.981 --> 42:17.257
Oh come on.

42:17.258 --> 42:18.396
Come on now.

42:18.397 --> 42:19.397
Come on.

42:23.817 --> 42:25.404
Hmm.

42:27.441 --> 42:30.132
Alright, I can't
believe everything

42:30.133 --> 42:31.721
that has happened sometimes.

42:41.697 --> 42:42.870
A 1,000 miles.

42:44.734 --> 42:48.566
We are far better off than
we were a 1,000 miles ago.

42:50.429 --> 42:51.429
All of us.

42:54.226 --> 42:56.573
All we have to do is just
keep putting one foot

42:56.574 --> 42:58.403
in front of the
other, that's it.

43:00.854 --> 43:03.270
And with the little help
of our North Star here,

43:05.341 --> 43:07.826
I have hope that we'll
find our way to the colony.

43:09.138 --> 43:10.415
We're gonna find our way.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.591
To hope.

43:15.351 --> 43:16.179
To hope.

43:16.179 --> 43:17.179
To hope.

43:17.871 --> 43:18.871
Amen, amen.

43:23.911 --> 43:25.429
You okay over there?

43:25.430 --> 43:26.430
Hope?

43:28.985 --> 43:29.985
Hope?

43:36.406 --> 43:38.131
You really think holding
hands, singing Kumbaya's

43:38.132 --> 43:39.340
gonna make a difference?

43:40.997 --> 43:45.794
Did anybody actually
look what's out there?

43:45.795 --> 43:49.453
Hey we're in here celebrating.

43:49.454 --> 43:50.523
Just a some cake.

43:50.524 --> 43:53.009
What are we celebrating?

43:54.459 --> 43:55.839
What that we're stranded in
the middle of fucking nowhere

43:55.840 --> 43:59.050
with all our food buried
under 50 feet of sand?

44:00.189 --> 44:02.052
I mean tell me Henry,

44:02.053 --> 44:04.054
What's on the menu
once the cake is gone?

44:04.055 --> 44:07.540
Warren, I know you've
been through it and I know

44:07.541 --> 44:10.025
getting to the colony seems
like an impossibility,

44:10.026 --> 44:13.719
but it is completely viable
that we will make it there.

44:13.720 --> 44:17.206
Oh right, the colony.

44:23.039 --> 44:26.973
We'll just sit back,
have a few cocktails,

44:26.974 --> 44:31.426
and enjoy the sunset
because in a 1,000 miles

44:31.427 --> 44:33.670
things are gonna
get so much better.

44:33.671 --> 44:38.605
Alright everybody let's
put it together for Warren,

44:38.606 --> 44:39.987
man of the year.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.129
You think this is
a joke don't you?

44:46.684 --> 44:49.547
I think you're an
inspiration to all of us.

44:49.548 --> 44:50.377
You think
this is a goddamn joke?

44:50.378 --> 44:52.136
Whoa, whoa.

44:52.137 --> 44:53.137
Okay!

44:59.593 --> 45:02.353
You all want to know
what the real joke is?

45:02.354 --> 45:03.458
Huh?

45:03.459 --> 45:05.047
Warren is the joke.

45:06.427 --> 45:08.290
We've been following this
piece of shit for way too long.

45:08.291 --> 45:09.120
Put that down.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.120
Oh yeah?

45:11.122 --> 45:13.537
And who made you the
law here anyway, huh?

45:13.538 --> 45:14.572
What just because
you used to run

45:14.573 --> 45:16.333
a fucking goddamn prison in some

45:16.334 --> 45:18.956
pathetic little
shit hole, big deal!

45:18.957 --> 45:21.165
You're nothing but a
pathetic little piece of.

45:21.166 --> 45:22.996
Okay, alright, alright.

45:25.446 --> 45:26.446
Warren stop!

45:27.517 --> 45:28.933
Warren stop, stop.

45:31.901 --> 45:34.317
Stop it, stop it, just
breathe, fucking breathe.

45:36.319 --> 45:40.358
You're okay just breathe
okay, just breathe.

45:41.773 --> 45:43.498
There you go man.

45:43.499 --> 45:45.259
You're alright, you're alright.

45:47.883 --> 45:49.885
There you go, it's okay.

45:52.163 --> 45:53.198
I got you.

45:55.442 --> 45:56.476
I can't.

45:56.477 --> 45:58.548
I know, I know, I know.

46:00.688 --> 46:02.482
Just inhale.

46:02.483 --> 46:03.587
I can't do it anymore.

46:03.588 --> 46:05.313
One step at a time.

46:05.314 --> 46:06.902
One step at a time.

46:10.112 --> 46:11.284
Okay let's get you up.

46:11.285 --> 46:12.114
Hey there buddy come on.

46:12.115 --> 46:13.943
Get up, you're okay.

46:18.016 --> 46:19.466
You're alright.

46:20.708 --> 46:21.708
You okay?

46:22.607 --> 46:23.608
You alright?

46:25.817 --> 46:26.818
You alright?

46:39.244 --> 46:40.244
Come on,

46:42.247 --> 46:43.697
it's gonna be okay.

46:44.871 --> 46:46.458
It's gonna be okay.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.316
We need to block the door.

47:17.317 --> 47:18.145
What's going on?

47:18.145 --> 47:19.145
What?

47:23.530 --> 47:24.945
Help me here.

47:29.743 --> 47:31.537
It's not moving!

47:31.538 --> 47:32.745
Focus.

47:32.746 --> 47:34.195
Fuck, it's
got to be bolted down.

47:34.196 --> 47:36.405
Jesus Christ man let's
just take these things off.

48:07.022 --> 48:08.782
Well hello there.

48:10.957 --> 48:14.097
How did a pretty girl like you
end up in a place like this?

48:14.098 --> 48:16.410
Please enter
your authorization code.

48:17.342 --> 48:18.342
I see.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.001
Playing hard to get.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.106
So what now?

48:23.107 --> 48:25.799
Time to use my
irresistible charm.

48:28.595 --> 48:30.320
Whoa!

48:30.321 --> 48:33.840
So we're just gonna break in?

48:33.841 --> 48:36.050
We don't even know
what's in there.

48:36.051 --> 48:37.810
We know what's out there.

48:37.811 --> 48:39.916
Let's just get that
pass key overall,

48:39.917 --> 48:42.159
see isn't that better?

48:42.160 --> 48:43.195
Yes, and.

48:43.196 --> 48:45.059
Awe shit!

48:45.060 --> 48:46.820
Authorization code denied.

48:48.339 --> 48:49.271
What are you doing?

48:49.272 --> 48:50.478
Oh you know, just decrypting

48:50.479 --> 48:53.550
a multi binary quantum algorithm

48:53.551 --> 48:57.037
with the stochastic
matrix protocol.

49:06.046 --> 49:07.046
That means.

49:08.428 --> 49:09.256
Ha, Bam!

49:09.257 --> 49:10.670
Okay, okay, alright.

49:10.671 --> 49:11.913
Come on.

49:11.914 --> 49:13.018
Time to drop the panties.

49:13.019 --> 49:15.849
Authorization code accepted.

49:23.201 --> 49:25.340
Come on
everybody, let's go move it.

49:25.341 --> 49:26.583
Where's my bag?

49:26.584 --> 49:29.345
Warren, it's up
here buddy, come on.

49:33.349 --> 49:34.349
Warren!

49:43.670 --> 49:45.154
No, no!

49:48.847 --> 49:49.847
Warren!

50:06.451 --> 50:07.521
Is everyone all right?

50:12.975 --> 50:14.287
Gus, right here.

50:15.667 --> 50:16.667
Warren.

50:23.986 --> 50:25.712
You okay? You sure?

50:29.681 --> 50:31.061
Hello?

50:31.062 --> 50:32.063

Oh God.

55:18.453 --> 55:20.386
It's all your fault.

55:27.185 --> 55:29.153
Think, think, think, think.

55:56.318 --> 55:57.492
Oh.

56:20.204 --> 56:21.378
You son of a bitch.

57:11.531 --> 57:13.049
Let's see.

Rewind

57:15.535 --> 57:17.123
fate.
