WEBVTT

00:01.950 --> 00:03.952
Previously onSEAL Team...JASON: There's been an accident.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.729
My wife, Alana Hayes.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.651
I'm sorry.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.873
JASON:
It's always been Alana and me.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.308
A family.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.305
She held everything together

00:14.360 --> 00:16.180
and made it work.

00:16.230 --> 00:17.527
I need something from you.

00:17.580 --> 00:18.877
I need you back
on Bravo Team,

00:18.930 --> 00:20.704
if you're okay with that.

00:22.670 --> 00:23.978
You didn't go?

00:24.020 --> 00:25.840
No.

00:25.890 --> 00:28.358
ERIC: We have a situation.
Pakistani radicals

00:28.410 --> 00:30.719
have taken over_a hotel
In Mumbal.

00:33.510 --> 00:35.899
MANDY:
FSO David Nelson.

00:35.940 --> 00:38.022
We believe
he's still in his room.

00:40.380 --> 00:43.167
ERIC:
Indian government has given us
the green light to go in,

00:43.210 --> 00:45.861
rescue our FSO.

00:45.910 --> 00:47.901
That is the extent
of our missmn.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.120
It's a dry hole, boss.

00:49.170 --> 00:50.910
Havoc, we have a problem.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.485
Havoc, we have a problem.

01:04.540 --> 01:05.666
Big one.

01:05.710 --> 01:06.961
The FSO is gone.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.056
I say again,
our objective is gone.

01:13.810 --> 01:15.505
Bravo 1, I copy that.

01:15.550 --> 01:17.506
FSO Nelson is not in his room.

01:17.550 --> 01:18.630
Stand by.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.079
Looks like Nelson
put up a fight.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.076
These Muj,
they're real tough guys,

01:22.120 --> 01:24.111
beating up on a bunch
of paper pushers.

01:24.170 --> 01:26.331
You got to assume he was alive
when they dragged him out.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.119
SUMMER: Hotel's been
under siege for hours.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.343
This much blood,
might be a body recovery.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.164
Toss the room.

01:32.220 --> 01:33.778
RAY:
Roger that.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.663
They could've slipped Nelson out
in the initial chaos?

01:51.720 --> 01:53.324
I don't think so.
No one has entered or exited

01:53.370 --> 01:55.452
the hotel grounds
since Bravo made entry.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.149
So why didn't they just shoot
Nelson where they found him

01:57.200 --> 01:58.974
like everyone else?America has
always supported

01:59.030 --> 02:01.419
India over Pakistan
in the Kashmir conflict.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.599
Perhaps they see a high-profile
foreign service officer

02:03.640 --> 02:04.595
as leverage.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.982
Ransom?

02:06.030 --> 02:08.590
No. The attack's been underway
for almost a day,

02:08.650 --> 02:10.720
and not a single demand
has been made.

02:10.780 --> 02:14.557
Hizbul Mujahideen
is here for blood, not money.

02:14.610 --> 02:16.566
They will kill Nelson.

02:16.610 --> 02:19.568
And in a way
that'll bring maximum publicity.

02:19.610 --> 02:21.396
[alarm continues blaring
in distance]

02:27.400 --> 02:28.924
Bingo.

02:28.970 --> 02:30.005
He was hiding in here.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.276
Got Nelson's phone.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.140
Texts to his
wife and kids.

02:34.190 --> 02:36.454
Last_ one sent
22 minutes ago.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.229
We literally
just missed him.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.759
Nelson's still in
the building then.

02:39.810 --> 02:42.108
Well, he could be on any floor,
in any room.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.549
He's a giant needle

02:44.590 --> 02:46.638
in a 500-room haystack. He gone.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.293
Maybe not.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.089
Good call, Bravo 2.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.494
There he is.

03:22.550 --> 03:23.881
There.

03:23.940 --> 03:25.237
Got FSO Nelson.

03:25.290 --> 03:26.507
Camera 653.

03:26.550 --> 03:28.506
He's alive.

03:28.550 --> 03:30.336
Where are they?

03:30.380 --> 03:33.247
RAY: Looks like some kind
of storage room.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.426
Top floor.

03:34.470 --> 03:36.643
Always the
top floor.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.679
CLAY:
Uh, I got nine Tangos,

03:40.740 --> 03:41.957
by my count.

03:44.260 --> 03:46.046
Ten.

03:46.090 --> 03:47.739
RAY:
Ten men armed with AKs

03:47.790 --> 03:49.872
fortifying their position
in a room with only two ways in.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.968
As is,

03:52.010 --> 03:54.183
I don't see any way we do this
without taking casualties.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.886
Neither do I.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.416
NEWSCASTER: Chaos continues
to fill the streets of Mumbai

04:11.460 --> 04:13.508
as_ terror strikes
India's largest cnty.

04:13.550 --> 04:16.508
The death toll is rising
at four known locations targeted

04:16.560 --> 04:18.334
by the Hizbul Mujahideen.

04:18.380 --> 04:20.336
And while exact numbers
are not yet known,

04:20.390 --> 04:22.335
early estimates
of reported fatalities

04:22.390 --> 04:24.858
are in the dozens,
with the numbers of wounded

04:24.910 --> 04:27.697
well exceeding that.
Evacuations have been ordered

04:27.740 --> 04:30.789
in a two-kilometer radius
around each location.

04:30.830 --> 04:32.786
_ Mumbai itself
IS under mandatory curfew.

04:32.830 --> 04:35.617
How long that curfew
will last is not yet known.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.912
India's prime minister
is expected to make

04:37.970 --> 04:39.392
a public address
within the hour,

04:39.450 --> 04:42.271
and we'll bring that
to you live.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.975
Oh, you're up early.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.794
I was up all night.

04:47.850 --> 04:50.011
You didn't sleep?

04:50.070 --> 04:52.026
I made breakfast.

04:52.070 --> 04:54.846
For the whole neighborhood?

04:55.900 --> 04:57.026
How are you right now?

04:57.070 --> 04:58.241
What do you want me
to say, Mom?

04:58.290 --> 04:59.552
My life's been turned
upside down,

04:59.600 --> 05:01.329
then shoved right through
a shredder, okay?

05:01.380 --> 05:03.291
Well, you'll get through it.
That's what you do.

05:03.340 --> 05:04.853
You get people through things.

05:04.910 --> 05:06.810
This is different. This is
different. This is different.

05:06.870 --> 05:08.121
Is it?Yes, it's different, Mom.

05:08.170 --> 05:10.388
Different.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.829
So, um...

05:16.830 --> 05:18.434
What areyour plans?

05:18.490 --> 05:19.832
10:00 am. Emma.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.962
College counselor, right? 2:00.

05:22.010 --> 05:23.318
Mikey.
Basketball game. Boom.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.611
What are you talking about?

05:24.670 --> 05:26.399
I'm talking
about what my plans are, Mom.

05:26.450 --> 05:27.792
For the future.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.321
For Emma and Mikey's future.

05:31.370 --> 05:33.804
They just lost their mother.
What does today matter?

05:33.850 --> 05:35.329
Today is everything, okay?
Tomorrow is tomorrow.

05:35.370 --> 05:37.326
I'll worry about
tomorrow tomorrow.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.631
But today is today.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.176
Hey. What are you doing?

05:58.220 --> 05:59.824
I'm waiting for Mom.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.565
For her to come in here,
riding me about oversleeping.

06:02.620 --> 06:05.180
Okay, right--
well, right now,

06:05.230 --> 06:07.835
you have a-a college counselor
meeting this morning.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.017
So you got to get up.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.402
So?So,

06:10.450 --> 06:12.054
I'm here to take you.
All right?

06:12.110 --> 06:13.452
So, let's go. Get out of bed.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.922
I don't want you sitting
around here, doing nothing.

06:14.980 --> 06:17.369
I'm not doing nothing.
I'm missing Mom.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.103
Look, Emma,

06:19.160 --> 06:22.675
for me, dealing with a loss,

06:22.730 --> 06:24.595
how I deal with that
is I push through.

06:24.640 --> 06:25.811
You have to push through.

06:25.860 --> 06:28.499
I won't ignore my feelings
and soldier on,

06:28.560 --> 06:30.289
which is what you're asking.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.035
Even if I feel awful,

06:32.080 --> 06:33.900
I'm going to feel, Dad.

06:33.950 --> 06:36.953
I'm not stone.
I'm not you.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.096
Havoc, this is Bravo 1.

06:52.450 --> 06:54.179
Copy that, 1.

06:54.230 --> 06:56.016
The FSO is being held
by ten enemy combatants

06:56.060 --> 06:58.938
barricaded in a storage room
on the top floor.

06:58.980 --> 07:00.413
Team is too light for an assault

07:00.460 --> 07:01.848
on a f_o_rtified
pOSItIon,

07:01.890 --> 07:03.027
and I don't feel like adding

07:03.070 --> 07:04.458
Bravo Team
to their kill list.

07:04.510 --> 07:05.545
Stand by, 1.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.239
We need to run this
up the chain.

07:08.860 --> 07:11.590
Roger that. Standing
by to stand by.

07:12.690 --> 07:15.124
You think he's good?

07:17.610 --> 07:19.737
Dude's a freaking ninja, Sonny.

07:19.780 --> 07:22.567
All right, what's
your problem?Ain't no problem.

07:22.610 --> 07:26.080
Just Adam's been pulling Green
Team duty for quite a spell.

07:26.140 --> 07:28.085
And it feels strange
to take lead

07:28.140 --> 07:30.040
from someone that ain't Jason.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.705
I'd follow Adam anywhere.

07:32.750 --> 07:36.049
Mm. Don't get your panties
all twisted up there, Bam-Bam.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.443
It ain't the going
that worries me.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.104
It's the getting back.

07:40.150 --> 07:42.493
You think too much, Sonny.

07:42.540 --> 07:43.586
Maybe.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.847
Or not enough.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.107
Possible.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.060
Sometimes I can't tell.

07:48.110 --> 07:50.374
You know, if Jason was here,
he'd light both of you up.

07:50.420 --> 07:52.502
Focus on the op
and stop jaw-jacking

07:52.550 --> 07:53.721
like two Green Teamers.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.078
Are we good?

07:55.120 --> 07:57.588
Fine as Texas wine.

07:57.650 --> 07:59.038
We're good.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.866
You're gonna be
jaw-jacking later.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.343
SONNY:
I bet you will.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.689
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 1.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.651
Hostiles are getting ready
for their show.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.702
They're gonna toss him
from the building.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.369
Havoc, this is 1.

08:26.410 --> 08:28.878
We got to move
or we will lose the FSO.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.585
Bravo 1, unless
I am missing something,

08:32.640 --> 08:35.507
you are staring at an assault
that is tactical suicide.

08:35.550 --> 08:37.552
Thanks for sugarcoating it.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.295
You're the one
on the ground, 1.

08:39.340 --> 08:40.989
Convince me.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.598
Ideas?

08:42.650 --> 08:44.811
There's two stairwells
leading up to that room.

08:44.870 --> 08:46.519
There's one
on the top floor hall.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.822
One from the service hall,

08:47.870 --> 08:49.644
opposite side.
We hit 'em

08:49.700 --> 08:50.951
from opposing
directions, right?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.524
Clear toward each other.

08:52.570 --> 08:54.788
Ten enemy,
all their firepower.

08:54.830 --> 08:56.650
Question is, can we tap 'em
all out fast enough

08:56.710 --> 08:58.041
to keep Nelson alive?

08:59.750 --> 09:01.968
Monitors give us eyes.

09:02.010 --> 09:03.147
We can see them,
they can't see us.

09:03.190 --> 09:04.532
Makes it tactically possible.

09:04.580 --> 09:06.719
We buy time by pumping the room
with flash-bangs.

09:06.760 --> 09:07.715
SONNY:
Yeah.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.068
And then the white light's

09:09.110 --> 09:11.066
the last thing they'll see
before they head off

09:11.110 --> 09:13.328
to the big old virgin party
in the slq.

09:13.370 --> 09:15.543
Havoc, this is Bravo 1.

09:15.590 --> 09:17.114
We have a plan.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.242
Copy, 1. Go.We post

09:19.290 --> 09:22.077
Bravo 7 here and have
our own ISR in the building.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.941
Assault the room
from both entrances.

09:24.990 --> 09:26.810
Clear toward one another.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.167
We divide _their attention
and firepower.

09:28.210 --> 09:29.825
It'll work,
but we got to go now.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.304
Make it happen, 1.

09:33.350 --> 09:35.477
Kairos, you're our eyes.

09:35.530 --> 09:37.088
Anything changes
on these screens,

09:37.140 --> 09:40.132
you let us know.The Eye of Horus. I like it.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.579
Don't get trippy on me,
Moonbeam.

09:41.620 --> 09:42.962
Stuff makes me nervous.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.921
I'll watch over you, Sonny.

09:44.970 --> 09:46.665
Shut your mouth.

09:46.710 --> 09:48.792
Clay, you and Ray take the rear
stairwell position outside.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.979
The rest of us will approach
from the top floor hall. Good?

09:51.020 --> 09:52.931
Yeah.
Copy that.

10:03.510 --> 10:06.684
NEWS ANCHOR: Pakistani radicals
from the group Hizbul Mujahideen

10:06.730 --> 10:09.119
have taken control of several
targets throughout the City,

10:09.170 --> 10:10.728
including the National Theatre,

10:10.780 --> 10:13.340
the Gallery,
the Sopara Grand Hotel,

10:13.390 --> 10:15.346
leaving in their wake
dozens of victims.

10:15.390 --> 10:18.177
It's been reported that a guest
at the Sopara Grand Hotel,

10:18.220 --> 10:20.609
American Foreign Service
Officer, David Nelson,

10:20.660 --> 10:21.820
is still unaccounted for.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.563
Horrible, isn't it?

10:23.620 --> 10:27.795
People wake up, go to work,
and that happens to them.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.888
I'll never understand.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.886
Till you see it.

10:31.930 --> 10:35.661
Then you just know
that some people are evil, Mom.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.062
You going

10:39.110 --> 10:40.327
Without Emma?

10:40.370 --> 10:42.679
Emma doesn't want to go.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.415
She doesn't need to.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.109
Their mother just died.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.424
I know! I know
what happened!

10:48.470 --> 10:50.722
Stop!

10:56.220 --> 10:58.438
Someone needs to get stuff done
around here,

10:58.480 --> 11:00.380
instead of wallowing.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.260
That's what I'm doing--
getting things done.

11:02.310 --> 11:03.823
Stop reminding me.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.503
SONNY: Why is it when
every Hans takes a building,

11:30.550 --> 11:31.949
they don't have
the common decency

11:31.990 --> 11:33.503
to commandeer at a lower level?

11:33.560 --> 11:35.118
ADAM:
Optics.

11:35.170 --> 11:38.128
You kill Nelson in his room,
people only hear about it.

11:38.170 --> 11:40.297
Hang him from a building,
they never unsee it.

11:40.350 --> 11:41.954
BROCK: Yeah? So what
are they waiting for?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.127
ADAM: More cameras.More eyeballs.

11:44.180 --> 11:47.604
See, I still think the
Kardashians are the way to go.

11:47.660 --> 11:50.709
That's a time-proven means
right there.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.650
Bravo 2, we're
approaching level 33.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.359
What is your current position?

11:57.710 --> 12:01.623
Level 33, in position,
standing by.

12:03.630 --> 12:06.497
Bravo 7, talk to me.

12:06.550 --> 12:09.155
Hallway extending
to the main entrance is clear.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.020
Just inside, two Tangos
smoking and joking

12:11.070 --> 12:12.469
to your immediate right.

12:14.470 --> 12:18.554
Bravo 2, you should have
clean shots to two enemy

12:18.600 --> 12:20.591
upon your entry.ADAM. Roger that.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.081
stand by for my call.

12:38.710 --> 12:40.883
How many men
do you think were involved?

12:40.930 --> 12:45.105
Orchestrated, synchronized,
military-like attack on

12:45.150 --> 12:48.199
four high-profile targets
in a major city?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.413
40, at least.

12:50.460 --> 12:53.190
A lot of men, a lot of weapons,
trained up for the mission.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.320
And all that
costs a lot of money,

12:55.380 --> 12:57.507
the kind of money
Hizbul Mujahideen doesn't have.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.290
So where are they getting it?

12:59.340 --> 13:01.205
LAGHARI:
Lieutenant Commander Blackburn?

13:01.250 --> 13:02.683
What is it?

13:02.730 --> 13:04.732
Terrorists at the National
Theatre are neutralized.

13:04.780 --> 13:07.214
Force One assets are about to
assault the Tamerlane Gallery.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.865
So it looks like this nightmare
could be over soon.

13:13.350 --> 13:15.568
Video feed from my lieutenant's
body camera

13:15.620 --> 13:17.429
at The Tamerlane
Gallery.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.878
Moving through
the primary viewing room.

13:21.930 --> 13:23.534
Dead body.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.071
No.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.769
Suicide vests.

13:43.820 --> 13:46.288
Then, at the hotel,
they'll have them, too.

14:01.660 --> 14:04.572
Yippee ki-yay.

14:11.540 --> 14:14.759
Bravo 1, stand down!
I say again, stand down.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.937
Back off from the target.

14:21.810 --> 14:23.596
Bravo 2, hold what you got.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.244
I say again, hold
what you got.

14:25.290 --> 14:26.939
CLAY:
Yeah, copy.

14:30.650 --> 14:32.254
Havoc,

14:32.300 --> 14:33.904
this is Bravo 1.
Interrogative.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.087
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?

14:36.130 --> 14:37.950
Yeah, Bravo 1, strong likelihood

14:38.000 --> 14:40.309
that the enemy combatants
are wearing suicide vests.

14:41.570 --> 14:43.697
Sorry.

14:44.970 --> 14:47.097
Well, that's a real turd
in the punchbowl.

14:47.140 --> 14:49.313
ERIC: Bravo 1,
I need a sober assessment.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.794
Can you gain control of the
situation given this escalation?

14:51.840 --> 14:53.796
ADAM:
Stand by, Havoc.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.365
Bravo 7, you able to get a read
on the hostiles wearing vests?

14:56.410 --> 15:00.892
One posted approximately
three meters from the main door.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.890
Another near the kitchen.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.942
It looks like extra weight
around their waists.

15:08.990 --> 15:11.038
Could be S-belts,
but I can't be certain.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.719
The most likely breach point,
exactly where we were gonna be.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.123
How do you all plan
to breach a door

15:16.170 --> 15:18.559
when there's a guy strapping
an S-vest on the other side

15:18.610 --> 15:20.601
without him clacking it off?

15:22.220 --> 15:23.437
Hey, what about a lock pick?

15:23.480 --> 15:25.619
Smart thinking.

15:25.660 --> 15:27.560
CLAY:
What about a lock pick?

15:27.620 --> 15:29.303
Ken Doll is right.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.134
Bravo 1, you need me
up there to help?

15:31.190 --> 15:32.919
Negative, 7.

15:32.970 --> 15:35.621
Bomber at_ the main entrance-- he
still holding the same p05ition?

15:38.800 --> 15:41.189
A-firm. Same position
for the moment.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.935
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 1.

15:42.980 --> 15:46.507
We're Charlie Mike.
Charlie Mike.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.450
Roger that, Bravo 1.

15:48.510 --> 15:50.114
ADAM:
All Bravo elements, head shots.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.287
I say again, head
shots. Bravo 2,

15:52.340 --> 15:53.591
tell me when
you're in p05ition.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.165
CLAY:
Yeah, copy that.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.383
You ready?

15:58.430 --> 16:00.739
What? You don't think
you can make the shot?

16:00.780 --> 16:02.691
It's not me
I'm worried about.

16:04.390 --> 16:06.995
Look, Ray,
you've been out a long time.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.041
I got this, Clay.

16:09.090 --> 16:11.399
Just wanted _
to hear you say it.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.613
Bravo 1, in position,
standing by.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.704
Bravo 1, this is 7.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.012
Bomber's still
inside the main door,

16:24.070 --> 16:25.719
three meters,
not going anywhere.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.321
Check. Bravo 7,
when he turns away, you tell us.

16:29.370 --> 16:30.769
Roger that.

16:55.570 --> 16:57.572
Stand by.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.325
He's turned away. Go now.

17:12.370 --> 17:14.156
Execute.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.637
They're about

17:58.680 --> 18:00.636
to kill the FSO.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.122
Brock, photograph their faces.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.648
Everyone else, grab any
SSE material you can.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.099
Stay clear of the vests.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.220
Thank you.

18:22.270 --> 18:24.090
Mr. Nelson,
are you okay?

18:24.140 --> 18:25.619
Thank you. Thank you.

18:25.660 --> 18:28.003
We need to get you checked out.
Can you walk?

18:28.060 --> 18:29.834
H... H need to speak
to my family, my wife.

18:29.890 --> 18:31.494
We'll get you
medical attention

18:31.540 --> 18:33.792
first, sir;
then your family, I promise.

18:42.380 --> 18:43.859
What a world.

18:43.900 --> 18:46.334
Havoc, this is Bravo 1.
Target secure.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.632
Ten terrorists down,
no casualties.

18:48.690 --> 18:50.294
Heading for exfil
in three mikes.

18:50.340 --> 18:53.070
Roger that, Bravo 1.
Great work.

18:55.830 --> 18:59.732
Hey, it took a serious pair to
make that call. Nice work, boss.

19:08.010 --> 19:11.275
WOMAN: Mr. Hayes, it would be
perfectly okay to reschedule,

19:11.320 --> 19:12.924
given the circumstances.

19:12.970 --> 19:14.926
I know. I'm-I'm a guy
that likes to get things done,

19:14.970 --> 19:16.881
so, let's get 'em done.

19:16.930 --> 19:19.751
This is Emma's future
we're talking about.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.710
Seems she should be here.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.638
Right. Well,
I'm Emma's eyes and ears today.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.763
What do we got?

19:27.810 --> 19:32.167
Well, Emma, as you know,
has done extremely well.

19:32.210 --> 19:35.907
Her grades are exemplary,
even with a heavy AP load.

19:35.950 --> 19:37.941
And she has great
extracurriculars,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.128
and not of _the
hoop-jumping,
expected sort.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.478
Yearbook, debate.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.954
And volunteering--
homeless shelters and the V.A.

19:47.010 --> 19:49.262
V.A.? Wait, I didn't know
that she did that.

19:49.310 --> 19:50.789
Must be hard
to keep track,

19:50.840 --> 19:52.137
considering your
line of work.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.926
The 12 schools
Emma applied to...

19:57.970 --> 20:00.530
12 schools?
No, she wants to stay local.

20:03.890 --> 20:05.846
Harvard.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.583
Emma applied to Harvard?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.585
She didn't want to.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.858
She didn't want to burden
the family with the tuition.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.856
Does she have a shot?Yes.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.596
She does.

20:16.650 --> 20:17.981
I madeher apply.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.940
Whether she can afford
to go or not,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.161
I want her to know
what she's capable of.

20:22.220 --> 20:24.165
I didn't even know
a school like Harvard

20:24.220 --> 20:26.211
was even a possibility.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.619
Mr. Hayes?
Mm-hmm.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.833
How are things at home?

20:32.880 --> 20:35.781
Under control.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.001
Given that Emma's not here,

20:38.060 --> 20:40.278
I want to_ make sure
everything's okay.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.833
Like I say,
everything's under control,

20:41.890 --> 20:43.539
so, we're done here.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.581
I'll leave these here with you.

20:50.940 --> 20:54.808
This is the number of
a family therapist.

20:54.860 --> 20:56.816
Emma's fine.

20:56.860 --> 20:59.909
How do you know?

20:59.950 --> 21:04.865
This therapist is professional,
confidential, excellent.

21:04.910 --> 21:08.732
I think sitting down with him
would benefit Emma.

21:08.780 --> 21:11.044
Look, I know
what's best for Emma.

21:11.090 --> 21:14.082
Well, congratulations then.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.916
You're the first parent
to ever walk in here

21:16.970 --> 21:20.007
with an understanding
of what their teenager wants.

21:23.710 --> 21:26.053
Thanks.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.055
Harvard.

21:28.110 --> 21:30.806
I really know what's best
for Emma, but I appreciate it.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.508
Appreciate it, thank you.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.537
LINDA: Looking for
the calendar?

22:06.580 --> 22:08.366
Yep, looking for the calendar,
Mom, where is it?

22:08.410 --> 22:10.230
It's gone.

22:12.150 --> 22:13.674
I need it, Mom.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.199
Nothing in it matters.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.764
Everything in the
calendar matters.

22:16.810 --> 22:19.278
I need to plan things;
life goes on, do you understand?

22:19.330 --> 22:22.720
Mikey and Emma need a dad,
not a team leader.

22:22.770 --> 22:24.726
They've been in their room
this whole time

22:24.770 --> 22:26.726
while you're checking
meaningless things off a list.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.385
It's not meaningless nonsense,
Mom, do you understand me?

22:29.430 --> 22:31.204
I am trying to show them

22:31.260 --> 22:33.728
that staying busy helps
them forget the pain.

22:33.780 --> 22:35.031
Stop it!

22:35.090 --> 22:37.217
Just stop it!

22:37.260 --> 22:39.216
They don't need
to forget about the pain.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.568
They need to talk
to the one parent

22:41.620 --> 22:43.303
who is still alive.

22:50.150 --> 22:52.755
Alana would have been
prepared for all this.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.586
Do you understand me?
Alana would have prepared

22:54.630 --> 22:56.143
for all this, Mom.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.145
Not me.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.713
It was supposed to be me.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.025
They should have
been burying me.

23:03.070 --> 23:05.379
I'm the one who was
supposed to die, Mom.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.588
CLAY: Bravo 7,
you spot any more Tangos?

23:49.860 --> 23:53.853
Negative. Building's empty
as far as I can see.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.855
Save for bodies.

23:55.910 --> 23:58.208
ADAM: Roger that.
We'll meet you at exfil.

24:06.570 --> 24:07.741
Nice work.

24:07.790 --> 24:09.223
I owe you a bottle
of something.

24:09.270 --> 24:10.487
Some pumpkin seed oil,

24:10.530 --> 24:11.838
that really gets
your chakras going.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.609
Mezcal works. _ _
But now that you mention it,

24:13.660 --> 24:17.050
I notice you're holding a lot of
tension in your hips, Sonny.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.705
So help me, you ever
talk about my hips again,

24:19.760 --> 24:22.228
we're gonna get into it.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.714
Kairos gets a bottle for sitting
on his ass watching TV?

24:24.760 --> 24:26.489
Wish you'd taken his place?

24:26.550 --> 24:28.632
Hell no. Been on the sidelines
long enough, brother.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.897
Tell me about it.

24:32.550 --> 24:33.983
It's not long now, sir.

24:34.030 --> 24:35.725
We're gonna have someone
take a look at you,

24:35.770 --> 24:37.726
and then we'll, uh, we'll get
you connected to your family.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.202
All right. Thank you.

24:44.780 --> 24:46.509
Nice workup today there,
Master Chief, huh?

24:46.570 --> 24:49.266
Didn't do
too badly, yourself.

24:49.310 --> 24:51.346
You must've had a fine
Green Team instructor.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.308
You know it.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.351
Hey, was that already
last summer?

24:56.400 --> 24:58.834
Time flies. Been a good
year for you, though.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.575
Making Bravo Team.

25:00.620 --> 25:02.019
Stella not dumping your ass.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.493
That's not a bad 12 months.

25:03.540 --> 25:05.792
Yep.

25:05.850 --> 25:10.025
You know, I, uh, might've met
Stella's parents the other day.

25:10.070 --> 25:12.675
Thinking about making
a little trip overseas.

25:12.720 --> 25:16.019
Mm. You love her?

25:16.070 --> 25:18.026
I do.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.334
Good. Love is good.

25:24.870 --> 25:26.906
Something going on with you
and young Spenser?

25:28.830 --> 25:30.172
No. We're good.

25:30.220 --> 25:32.563
Yeah, my BS
detector goes off

25:32.610 --> 25:36.000
when two team guys
aren't on the same page.

25:36.050 --> 25:37.961
It's not a thing, Sonny.

25:38.010 --> 25:41.138
Don't pee on me and
tell me it's raining.

25:44.540 --> 25:47.532
Clay questioned my ability,
all right?

25:47.580 --> 25:50.583
And this is me letting it go.

25:50.630 --> 25:54.236
He's Bravo 2 now, and Bravo 2's
job is to look out for Bravo 1,

25:56.640 --> 25:59.154
He's doing his job.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.815
Can't fault him for that.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.249
Yeah. I guess we just
are all overcompensating

26:03.300 --> 26:05.689
with Jason gone, you know?

26:05.730 --> 26:09.473
Guy just always made
the right decision.

26:09.520 --> 26:13.433
Huh. Kind of took
it for granted.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.175
Hope he's doing okay.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.809
According to sources,
the death toll across Mumbai

26:49.860 --> 26:53.512
has reached 60 victims,
and though mandatory evacuations

26:53.560 --> 26:56.859
continue throughout the city,
that number is expected to rise

26:56.910 --> 26:58.730
in the wake
of today's terror attacks.

26:58.790 --> 27:00.690
While hospitals are at capacity

27:00.740 --> 27:02.696
and triage centers
are being established

27:02.750 --> 27:05.048
to tend to those wounded
in today's attacks,

27:05.100 --> 27:06.829
government officials
have not commented

27:06.880 --> 27:09.485
on any progress that has been...

29:26.410 --> 29:28.844
Hey. Five minutes,
both of you.
What?

29:28.890 --> 29:31.358
In the truck, let's go.What's going on? It's night.

29:31.420 --> 29:32.489
It's fine._We'r_e out of here.
Five minutes.

29:32.550 --> 29:33.539
Cool.

29:33.590 --> 29:34.898
I'm not going anywhere.

29:36.770 --> 29:37.896
Five minutes.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.560
ADAM:
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 1.

29:49.610 --> 29:51.566
Standing by for extract.
How far out are they?

29:51.610 --> 29:54.477
Copy, Bravo 1,
ET on the bearcat is four mikes.

29:54.530 --> 29:56.009
ADAM:
Roger. Four mikes.

29:56.050 --> 29:58.564
Commander Blackburn,
the situation has changed.

30:09.450 --> 30:11.759
Havoc, this is Bravo 1.
We are at RTB.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.584
ERIC:
Roger that, Bravo 1.

30:13.630 --> 30:16.064
What's the medical situation
with the FSO?

30:16.110 --> 30:17.839
He needs immediate care.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.504
Copy that, 1.

30:19.550 --> 30:22.599
Secure the FSO onto the bearcat
and send him to us.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.335
Havoc, say again your last.

30:24.380 --> 30:25.984
We're not escorting him?

30:26.040 --> 30:27.553
That's correct.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.158
You're being re-tasked

30:29.210 --> 30:31.519
to assist with enemy combatants
at the Khorana University.

30:31.560 --> 30:34.563
It's a hostage rescue.ADAM: Roger that.

30:34.610 --> 30:36.601
Frag-O to a hostage rescue
at Khorana University.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.743
Bravo 1, there are American
students trapped there.

30:39.790 --> 30:41.564
We're getting reports
of active shooters

30:41.620 --> 30:43.576
targeting students and faculty.

30:43.620 --> 30:45.576
How do we know
they're still alive?

30:45.620 --> 30:47.576
DAVIS: One student, Valerie
Wyatt, contacted her family

30:47.620 --> 30:50.271
in a live feed through
social media to say good-bye.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.618
And likely broadcasting
their position

30:53.670 --> 30:55.149
to the enemy at the same time.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.101
Please tell me
they're not 33 floors up.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.709
ERIC: Bravo 1, the target is
approximately 1,000 meters

31:01.770 --> 31:03.635
to the east _
of your current location.

31:03.680 --> 31:07.377
You'll have ISR support, but our
partner forces are spread thin.

31:07.430 --> 31:11.161
You're gonna have to patrol
to the university on your own.

31:11.210 --> 31:12.689
Roger that, Havoc.

31:12.740 --> 31:15.345
Sending a goodie bag your way
with the FSO.

31:15.390 --> 31:16.823
Mag check, boys.

31:16.870 --> 31:19.828
Clay, find me a route.

31:19.870 --> 31:22.134
I'm on it.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.136
Lovely night for a stroll, boys.

31:24.180 --> 31:25.829
Yeah, it's not like
we've been running up

31:25.880 --> 31:29.179
and down stairs all day.

31:48.250 --> 31:51.026
MICHAEL:
Where are we, Dad?

31:51.080 --> 31:52.900
JASON:
I need to figure something out.

31:52.950 --> 31:54.815
I'll know when I see it.

31:54.860 --> 31:57.033
EMMA:
This is so dumb.

32:04.220 --> 32:06.472
One day your mom and
I went for a drive.

32:06.530 --> 32:08.873
Pulled over,
decided to go for a hike,

32:08.920 --> 32:10.308
had a bottle of wine.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.225
We came across it.

32:12.270 --> 32:14.488
If you're gonna show us
where one of us was conceived,

32:14.540 --> 32:16.792
I swear I will puke.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.492
Okay, this is for you
in case we get lost.

32:20.540 --> 32:23.327
All right.Why not buy a couple
of those kid leashes?

32:23.370 --> 32:25.326
Ooh, or maybe chip us?

32:25.370 --> 32:27.804
You gonna follow me or what?

32:27.850 --> 32:29.249
Let's go.

32:29.290 --> 32:31.155
Can you please tell
us where we're going?

32:31.210 --> 32:33.895
I'll let you know
when I find it.

32:33.950 --> 32:37.113
Stupid.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.074
Keep up.

33:08.110 --> 33:10.237
There it is.

33:10.290 --> 33:12.986
That's it.

33:16.640 --> 33:19.029
This is your mom's
favorite place.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.594
She used to tell me
that from here,

33:21.650 --> 33:24.426
she could see all the way
to tomorrow.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.289
All the way.

33:36.750 --> 33:39.526
That wasn't the case with me.

33:43.490 --> 33:47.017
I could just see
what was in front of me.

33:50.020 --> 33:53.456
That's all.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.458
Wasn't always like that,
though. I...

33:58.070 --> 34:01.073
You know,
17 years ago, I was...

34:01.120 --> 34:03.293
I was in Utah, training.

34:03.340 --> 34:08.039
I was on this
800-foot rock face.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.436
Halfway up, I froze.
Couldn't move.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.300
The instructor saw
that I was in trouble,

34:13.350 --> 34:15.602
so he came up to me,
and he said,

34:15.660 --> 34:19.096
"You know what your problem is?
You're thinking too much.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.449
"You're thinking about what's...
what's ahead of you

34:21.490 --> 34:23.219
"instead of where you are.

34:23.270 --> 34:26.706
Right now in this moment,
where are you?"

34:26.760 --> 34:30.799
He said that you need
to focus on the now.

34:31.850 --> 34:34.273
Control what you can see,

34:34.330 --> 34:37.584
the three feet around you.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.767
Control that.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.334
And then the next three,

34:41.380 --> 34:44.429
then the next,
then the next.

34:44.470 --> 34:47.337
I made it to the top.

34:49.340 --> 34:52.776
Ever since that moment, I...

34:52.820 --> 34:56.119
that's how I've always
lived my life.

34:56.180 --> 34:59.172
Just like that,
being in the now.

35:01.220 --> 35:04.223
But, you know,
with your mom gone now, it...

35:06.230 --> 35:07.788
...it made me realize

35:07.840 --> 35:10.354
that I can't operate my family
that way.

35:10.410 --> 35:14.278
Your mom's not here anymore
to see tomorrow,

35:14.320 --> 35:16.936
so I have to be
more like her.

35:16.980 --> 35:20.893
I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to do this.

35:20.940 --> 35:22.840
But I'm gonna try.

35:22.900 --> 35:26.893
I have to try to see the world
like your mom.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.252
One more thing
I want you to see.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.864
Right here.

35:37.910 --> 35:39.775
It's on here somewhere.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.208
Here it is.

35:44.270 --> 35:46.226
That's it. Right there.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.522
That's your mom.

35:50.450 --> 35:52.748
Go ahead.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.448
One last thing, okay?

36:06.640 --> 36:09.632
We are gonna finish
this, okay?

36:21.610 --> 36:23.510
All right, buddy, let's go.
Off to bed, all right?

36:23.570 --> 36:26.949
Right. Night, Dad.
Night, Emma.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.955
Send it to me.

36:29.010 --> 36:31.137
Send what?

36:31.180 --> 36:33.489
The picture, Dad.

36:33.530 --> 36:36.488
Right.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.491
JASON: Get it?

36:42.930 --> 36:44.932
Mm. Thanks, Dad.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.971
Yeah.I love you.

36:50.420 --> 36:52.376
Love you.

37:12.140 --> 37:14.608
You hear that?

37:14.660 --> 37:16.093
Hear what?

37:19.280 --> 37:22.579
That kind of stuff right there,
that gives me the jitters.

37:22.630 --> 37:24.439
DAVIS:
Bravo 1, you have

37:24.500 --> 37:27.276
three unknowns concealed behind
what appears to be a dumpster.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.766
They appear to be stationary.
Ten meters north

37:31.810 --> 37:32.799
of your position.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.738
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.

37:45.780 --> 37:48.123
Hey, it's okay.
Take my hand.

37:48.170 --> 37:49.728
Get up. Up, up, up, up.Here. Hey, look-- candy.

37:49.780 --> 37:53.170
Candy. Look at this.
Here, here. Come on.

37:58.450 --> 38:01.829
It's okay. Here you go.
Right in there.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.328
Move it.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.452
Kairos, you can keep
your damn crystals.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.412
I'm telling you all
I've got some psychic in me.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.803
I believe you mean "psycho."

39:39.460 --> 39:41.712
There's nothing I can say,
Jason.

39:41.770 --> 39:44.853
Kim is beside herself.

39:44.900 --> 39:47.630
We all are.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.898
A bit of advice?

39:49.950 --> 39:52.589
Only answer is time.

39:54.260 --> 39:57.821
Time. Yes, sir.

39:57.870 --> 39:59.735
It's why I'm here, sir.

39:59.780 --> 40:02.567
I've been in Teams
for nearly 20 years,

40:02.610 --> 40:05.488
and leading Bravo Team
for about half that.

40:10.010 --> 40:13.480
JASON: My team,
they've become family to me.

40:13.540 --> 40:16.361
Blood. Those are my brothers.

40:18.540 --> 40:22.579
Some are still with us,
some have been torn apart,

40:22.630 --> 40:25.588
but my brothers have
always been there for me.

40:25.640 --> 40:26.971
And me for them.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.340
Sniper!

40:54.880 --> 40:56.745
Where the hell's
he shooting from?

40:56.800 --> 41:00.759
Havoc, troops in contact.
I say again, troops in contact!

41:12.380 --> 41:15.247
Bravo is in good hands
with Adam.

41:15.290 --> 41:17.679
My team, they'll be good
without me.

41:22.690 --> 41:25.818
I... I'm not gonna die.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.044
I don't believe you.

41:36.270 --> 41:37.612
I'm not gonna die.

41:56.600 --> 41:57.942
JASON:
But my son, my daughter,

41:57.990 --> 42:00.720
they won't be good without me.

42:00.770 --> 42:03.728
My family needs me, sir,

42:03.780 --> 42:05.463
and I need to be there
with them.

42:07.690 --> 42:10.989
That's why I need
to take a step back.

42:11.050 --> 42:12.915
Need to stop operating.

42:18.620 --> 42:21.088
I have to leave Bravo Team.
