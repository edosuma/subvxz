06:27.583 --> 06:31.583
THEO
AND THE METAMORPHOSES

11:06.883 --> 11:09.508
My parents called me Théo,

11:10.008 --> 11:12.758
but I call myself TO.

11:13.425 --> 11:17.133
I've lived in this house
ever since I was born.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.675
I've learned to feel good in it.

11:22.967 --> 11:27.008
My father calls it the forest workshop

11:27.175 --> 11:31.175
because he sometimes thinks
he's a lumberjack.

11:34.383 --> 11:36.717
But he's a photographer,

11:36.883 --> 11:40.800
and this is also
his photographic workshop.

11:54.633 --> 11:59.383
I decided to become
a martial arts master,

12:01.550 --> 12:03.592
trained by my father,

12:05.550 --> 12:08.050
a doctor in demolition.

12:14.800 --> 12:19.217
My father decided to cover
the house with burned wood.

12:19.383 --> 12:21.592
It's a Japanese technique.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.883
It protects the wood

12:24.300 --> 12:26.800
and it's called <i>yakisugi</i>.

12:27.842 --> 12:29.425
Why did my father do that?

12:29.592 --> 12:32.675
Why did he dress
the house like that?

12:32.925 --> 12:35.675
It's because
he doesn't want anyone to know

12:35.842 --> 12:39.467
that it's actually
a secret training camp

12:39.633 --> 12:41.800
for peaceful warriors.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.592
But I'm not peaceful.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.258
Maybe that's my problem.

12:54.342 --> 13:01.842
TO AND HIS FATHER

13:21.508 --> 13:22.550
My father

13:22.717 --> 13:26.300
has raised me
since my mother left us.

13:26.467 --> 13:27.758
I mean,

13:28.133 --> 13:29.592
she's dead.

13:32.050 --> 13:34.300
At first, I cried.

13:36.133 --> 13:38.717
But then I told myself

13:38.883 --> 13:40.592
that it was pointless.

13:41.342 --> 13:45.175
It's because I realized
she no longer existed,

13:45.342 --> 13:48.967
that she's now back in the universe.

13:50.050 --> 13:52.800
That's what our tomb is:

13:53.133 --> 13:54.800
the universe.

13:56.008 --> 14:00.050
I can bring my mother back
whenever I want.

14:01.842 --> 14:05.717
One should know
that my mother was the first woman

14:05.883 --> 14:08.008
to climb Mount Everest.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.550
She was also the Virgin Mary.

14:13.175 --> 14:14.925
Well, I think so.

14:17.550 --> 14:20.133
My father is convinced

14:20.300 --> 14:24.550
he's a nice, sweet dad.
But it's not quite like that.

14:27.258 --> 14:29.633
Every day, like any disciple,

14:29.800 --> 14:32.175
I have exercises to do.

14:32.342 --> 14:36.675
First of all, swallow
2 glasses of milk without breathing.

14:38.175 --> 14:41.633
Then, I have to slay 4 flies.
Like this.

14:47.425 --> 14:48.425
Samurai!

14:48.592 --> 14:51.008
Every day, my father teaches me

14:51.175 --> 14:55.467
new forms of martial arts.
Not a single day off.

14:55.717 --> 14:58.425
That's real discipline.

14:59.342 --> 15:02.467
My father is a master
who smokes like a chimney

15:02.633 --> 15:05.383
because he says
you have to tire the lungs

15:05.550 --> 15:09.758
when there's too much yang
to get it down in the kidneys' energy.

15:09.925 --> 15:12.217
Well, something like that.

15:12.717 --> 15:14.300
It's just a matter

15:14.467 --> 15:16.175
of finding the right balance.

15:17.342 --> 15:20.175
And balance is sacred.

15:20.342 --> 15:23.342
It's the basis of martial arts.

15:31.633 --> 15:33.133
When he was young,

15:33.300 --> 15:37.967
my father dropped acid in a sweat lodge

15:38.133 --> 15:41.133
with an Amerindian shaman

15:41.300 --> 15:44.008
who, as he was about
to beat the drum,

15:44.175 --> 15:46.633
saw my father go into a trance

15:46.800 --> 15:49.425
and turn into a wolf.

15:51.925 --> 15:55.217
So, the shaman went crazy

15:55.383 --> 15:59.758
and punched him in the face, saying:

16:00.217 --> 16:03.758
''You should've told me
you were a shaman, asshole!''

16:06.175 --> 16:09.467
When he says that,
it makes me laugh a lot.

16:15.467 --> 16:17.550
Fuck! You're insane!

16:18.550 --> 16:20.967
You fucking scalded me!

16:21.383 --> 16:23.217
I don't fucking believe it!

16:24.550 --> 16:28.300
My father has reduced his training
to the basics.

16:29.508 --> 16:32.258
He trains in cold water.

16:33.717 --> 16:35.633
Although he is

16:35.800 --> 16:37.717
a westerner,

16:37.883 --> 16:40.550
he really is a martial arts master.

16:46.800 --> 16:47.800
TO!

16:47.883 --> 16:50.925
And he's, of course, very demanding.

17:22.467 --> 17:23.842
My passion

17:24.008 --> 17:25.550
is drawing.

17:25.925 --> 17:27.925
In fact, it's my profession.

17:28.092 --> 17:30.550
I'm a great draughtsman.

17:31.883 --> 17:34.467
My favorite colors are

17:34.883 --> 17:36.133
red

17:36.467 --> 17:37.842
and black.

17:38.592 --> 17:41.717
And what I prefer drawing is

17:41.883 --> 17:43.550
circus tents.

17:44.758 --> 17:48.717
It looks a bit like
our forest workshop.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.800
When I leave the forest,

17:57.967 --> 18:01.383
I know I'll come across a smiling child

18:01.550 --> 18:03.592
who'll play the flute for me

18:04.217 --> 18:05.883
by a small fire

18:06.050 --> 18:07.842
in the cold night.

18:19.592 --> 18:21.467
I have a secret.

18:22.175 --> 18:24.508
When I walk with my father,

18:24.675 --> 18:28.050
I use a magic power

18:28.217 --> 18:32.467
to conjure up wild animals to him.

18:34.008 --> 18:39.217
So, he's happy to live here with me.

19:52.717 --> 19:54.008
My father

19:54.175 --> 19:58.633
decided to build
a tea house in the trees.

19:59.842 --> 20:04.925
He's a pain, he always wants me there
with him in the beech woods,

20:05.092 --> 20:07.092
supposedly to teach me

20:07.258 --> 20:09.508
geometry in space.

20:12.425 --> 20:15.633
There must be 130... 135.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.175
I can tell at once.

20:20.217 --> 20:21.217
140.

20:21.633 --> 20:24.842
When he takes measurements like that,

20:25.008 --> 20:30.508
although we already have a cabin,
which is enough to drink tea...

20:30.675 --> 20:31.800
140.

20:31.967 --> 20:33.717
He really irritates me.

20:34.842 --> 20:38.633
I'd like to tell him,
but I don't know how to go about it.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.217
So, instead,

20:40.383 --> 20:41.717
I spit.

20:41.883 --> 20:43.383
It's more fun.

21:15.717 --> 21:19.383
The best thing is
to surprise your opponent

21:19.550 --> 21:21.258
and knock him down.

21:24.467 --> 21:27.925
And since I'll soon be a master myself,

21:28.092 --> 21:31.842
I can bring him down,
despite his power.

21:32.008 --> 21:33.008
Scram!

21:33.092 --> 21:35.925
That drives him crazy,
he can't stand it.

21:36.092 --> 21:39.008
- Samurai!
- Yeah, go play samurai.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.883
Shitty samurai!

21:43.217 --> 21:47.258
A real fight can happen at any time,
even if you get thrashed.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.467
Every once in a while,
we have to relax.

22:26.425 --> 22:29.467
The master becomes a dad for real...

22:29.633 --> 22:32.050
Go on, get out of here!

22:32.217 --> 22:35.175
And the disciple, his son.

22:43.717 --> 22:47.383
As a boy, I wanted to be
the world champion of Thai boxing,

22:47.550 --> 22:49.425
like Muhammad Ali.

22:51.717 --> 22:55.717
With the punchbag,
I imagine an opponent who I can

22:55.883 --> 22:59.550
let off steam with!
And I usually manage

22:59.717 --> 23:05.050
to get him in a stranglehold
with my legs.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.467
Like this.

23:10.175 --> 23:13.842
Afterwards, his ribs are squashed.

23:15.842 --> 23:19.133
I finish him off with a <i>yoko geri</i>.

23:19.300 --> 23:20.758
Like this!

23:23.675 --> 23:25.883
After the last training session

23:26.050 --> 23:30.508
of the day,
I go straight up to bed.

23:55.967 --> 23:57.592
One day, I'll travel

23:57.758 --> 23:59.758
around the world

23:59.925 --> 24:02.717
and with my eye,
I'll capture everything.

24:03.758 --> 24:05.425
As I'll have

24:05.592 --> 24:08.342
a bio-ionic eye, I'll have my data

24:08.800 --> 24:10.675
in my internal hard drive.

24:13.342 --> 24:14.717
I'll define the world

24:15.217 --> 24:17.300
through my eye.

24:18.842 --> 24:21.925
But that won't make me
a robot, though.

24:33.258 --> 24:36.675
My father may be a martial arts master,

24:36.842 --> 24:40.342
but that doesn't stop him
from cracking up sometimes.

24:40.883 --> 24:45.133
To get rid of all his demons,
he makes big fires.

24:48.050 --> 24:51.717
I now know
that he has suffered a lot

24:51.883 --> 24:55.842
and that he has kept it all
inside for too long.

26:15.925 --> 26:21.092
I have 24 teeth
and I'm a Chinese albino.

26:26.758 --> 26:29.008
Before the first training session,

26:29.175 --> 26:33.217
I check that my father
has taken his bath.

26:45.425 --> 26:47.592
Since my mother left,

26:47.758 --> 26:50.300
my father has been forced to learn

26:50.467 --> 26:53.258
how to clean the house
and do the laundry.

26:54.092 --> 26:56.175
But you can't really learn it,

26:56.342 --> 26:59.092
especially for a man his age.

26:59.717 --> 27:01.425
He can, though.

27:01.592 --> 27:03.592
He's very smart.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.675
A good housekeeper.

27:29.050 --> 27:32.467
My father loves
to watch the snake eagle.

27:33.717 --> 27:37.717
It's a very beautiful raptor
that comes to nest every year

27:37.883 --> 27:39.592
in our forest.

27:40.092 --> 27:43.050
''See, TO, we're very lucky

27:43.217 --> 27:46.550
because it's exceptional to see that.''

27:46.967 --> 27:48.883
That makes me laugh.

27:49.508 --> 27:52.217
I'm the one
who makes it come every year.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.092
When my father

27:59.258 --> 28:03.258
works on his external strength,
it's to work

28:03.425 --> 28:05.508
on his internal strength.

28:06.217 --> 28:09.675
It's what the Chinese call the <i>Qi</i>.

28:10.550 --> 28:14.633
It's the internal energy
that circulates within us.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.925
We all depend on it.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.217
TO!

28:19.883 --> 28:23.258
Come here.
You still can't split a log!

28:23.800 --> 28:27.133
That's why my father never gets sick.

28:27.300 --> 28:30.175
Because he works
on his <i>Qi </i>every day.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.175
It starts with <i>dan tien</i>,

28:32.342 --> 28:34.633
then <i>fali</i>, the explosive force.

28:36.758 --> 28:40.508
When my father's on the warpath,
I'd better

28:40.675 --> 28:42.592
get ready pretty quick

28:42.758 --> 28:46.592
for the anatomical acupressure exercise.

28:47.592 --> 28:50.967
He invented it to teach me

28:51.133 --> 28:54.300
the 6 organs and the 12 meridians.

28:54.467 --> 28:55.675
Master heart!

28:56.925 --> 28:58.050
Large intestine!

29:01.342 --> 29:02.883
Bladder!

29:04.883 --> 29:06.425
Triple burner!

29:07.717 --> 29:09.050
Spleen!

29:09.842 --> 29:10.967
Kidney!

29:11.133 --> 29:12.300
Heart!

29:14.092 --> 29:15.633
Gallbladder!

29:16.842 --> 29:18.217
Stomach!

29:21.633 --> 29:22.800
Bladder!

29:22.967 --> 29:24.217
Small intestine!

29:26.925 --> 29:27.925
Testicles!

29:28.800 --> 29:29.967
Liver!

29:39.758 --> 29:41.717
Come on, you're OK now?

29:51.467 --> 29:54.342
But more often than not,
it gets out of hand.

30:04.008 --> 30:07.550
When I was a kid,
my father used to fly-fish.

30:08.675 --> 30:12.050
He also said it was martial practice,

30:13.092 --> 30:16.300
that casting the line was like

30:16.467 --> 30:18.383
wielding a sword or a stick,

30:18.800 --> 30:20.508
but it doesn't hurt.

30:26.550 --> 30:31.633
I'm also great at skimming pebbles.

30:32.675 --> 30:34.008
I'm a natural at it.

30:45.758 --> 30:46.925
Now

30:47.883 --> 30:51.300
I practice self-hypnosis.

30:53.675 --> 30:57.925
I sense agitation in my body
and it's good.

31:01.258 --> 31:04.633
At times like that, I empty my mind.

31:05.967 --> 31:08.175
Everything loosens up

31:09.508 --> 31:11.633
and everything opens up.

31:16.050 --> 31:20.508
It's practically
a psycho-physiological trip.

31:50.633 --> 31:54.300
I have my own way of talking to birds.

31:54.467 --> 31:58.050
It's a grimace
that emits an ultra-sound,

31:58.633 --> 32:01.883
and the birds understand that it's time

32:02.133 --> 32:04.175
for conversation.

32:05.550 --> 32:07.383
What I like best

32:07.550 --> 32:09.550
is the little birds chirping.

33:07.092 --> 33:09.717
My hare and I train

33:09.883 --> 33:11.425
every day

33:12.383 --> 33:14.675
in a jujitsu session.

33:15.050 --> 33:17.008
He's so highly strung.

33:17.675 --> 33:21.425
He makes me work on my reflexes.

33:22.967 --> 33:24.717
You wouldn't think so,

33:24.883 --> 33:28.217
but he's a formidable opponent.

33:44.633 --> 33:49.883
When I manage to immobilize him,

33:50.050 --> 33:51.342
he submits.

33:53.050 --> 33:56.550
But make no mistake,
that won't stop him

33:56.717 --> 34:00.008
getting the upper hand next time.

34:38.217 --> 34:40.092
Porn is boring.

34:40.925 --> 34:42.258
It's technical.

34:42.425 --> 34:43.758
Mechanical.

34:44.050 --> 34:45.758
There's no love.

34:50.342 --> 34:52.092
When my father taught me

34:52.258 --> 34:54.550
the art of combat,

34:54.717 --> 34:57.425
he showed me that it's like a dance.

34:57.967 --> 35:03.675
''You're not actually dancing,
it's the intention dancing in you.''

35:03.842 --> 35:08.008
He calls it
''great achievement boxing''.

35:08.550 --> 35:11.467
I went to check on the internet

35:11.633 --> 35:14.758
and I saw an old Chinese master.

35:14.925 --> 35:17.717
But it was much more fluid

35:17.883 --> 35:19.383
and much lighter.

35:19.842 --> 35:23.592
Whereas when my father does this,
it freaks me out.

35:26.383 --> 35:29.800
He never listens to the news.
He says

35:29.967 --> 35:32.842
that it's pointless
as it's always the same

35:33.008 --> 35:34.467
tragedies.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.508
That listening to it

35:37.758 --> 35:39.675
makes you stupid.

35:39.842 --> 35:41.258
And it's depressing.

35:42.133 --> 35:44.133
We get along fine without it.

35:51.092 --> 35:54.467
They call us
''the men of the woods''.

35:55.425 --> 35:57.092
That's flattering.

36:12.133 --> 36:13.342
What crap!

37:28.008 --> 37:32.550
I walk and feel the warmth of the sun

37:33.175 --> 37:35.092
on my skull.

37:35.508 --> 37:38.175
I climb up the mountain

37:38.342 --> 37:40.675
and I see in the distance

37:40.842 --> 37:42.800
my friend Tao.

37:45.508 --> 37:49.758
He's Chinese, he's my age,
and he wants to become

37:49.925 --> 37:52.758
a tai chi master.

37:57.758 --> 38:02.217
It makes us laugh
that his name is Tao and mine is TO.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.217
He tells me that I'm his double.

38:20.050 --> 38:22.967
It's not that I'm afraid of death...

38:24.550 --> 38:27.050
but I think, once we're dead,

38:27.217 --> 38:31.050
it must be good
to have a home again.

38:31.925 --> 38:36.800
That's why I built myself a sarcophagus.

38:40.633 --> 38:42.842
I'm rather proud of it.

38:45.258 --> 38:46.883
Anyway, my father

38:47.050 --> 38:50.383
showed up and said:
''My little TO,

38:50.550 --> 38:52.258
I'll be away a few days.''

38:52.425 --> 38:56.550
I'm doing an exhibition,
I'll be back soon. I'm going to present

38:56.717 --> 39:00.508
the photographic rolls.
It's a non-exhibition

39:00.675 --> 39:02.342
but it's an exhibition.

39:03.467 --> 39:05.258
A non-photographic exhibition.

39:10.675 --> 39:12.925
Don't get up to any shit.

39:13.717 --> 39:15.842
Look after yourself.
I'll be back.

39:17.383 --> 39:19.133
Well, I'm going.

39:20.050 --> 39:21.508
I love you, son.

39:21.675 --> 39:23.300
No, I'm kidding!

39:25.300 --> 39:28.217
My father's so funny,
always playing jokes.

39:28.758 --> 39:30.758
He's a hell of a joker.

39:33.133 --> 39:37.467
At last my father decided
to get off my back,

39:37.633 --> 39:39.758
to fuck off to his exhibition.

39:39.925 --> 39:42.133
And it was so cool

39:42.300 --> 39:45.550
to know that I could take it easy.

39:48.258 --> 39:49.675
Nice and easy!

39:54.550 --> 39:57.717
<i>Adios padre de la muerte!</i>

40:00.300 --> 40:04.133
Fathers are most often
a danger to their sons.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.508
It's even the case with animals.

40:06.675 --> 40:09.217
For example,
when a lion cub is a baby,

40:09.550 --> 40:11.925
it can be devoured by its father.

40:12.092 --> 40:15.008
But I won't let myself be devoured.

40:15.175 --> 40:17.883
Here, Dad, a little apparition!

40:23.717 --> 40:28.592
Apparently you have to kill the father
so as to become a father.

40:28.758 --> 40:30.800
So they say, I'm told.

40:33.967 --> 40:35.675
What about the mother?

40:35.967 --> 40:37.550
What do we do with her?

40:37.758 --> 40:39.383
When do we kill her?

40:45.008 --> 40:47.258
I decided to clean up.

40:48.175 --> 40:51.425
It's important
to lighten your load in life.

41:10.675 --> 41:11.925
You must also

41:12.092 --> 41:15.717
destroy the father's work.

41:27.467 --> 41:30.175
When the human race has died out,

41:30.342 --> 41:32.883
there'll be nothing left.

41:37.092 --> 41:40.050
Who cares about posterity?

41:55.217 --> 41:57.050
Farewell, Tao.

42:02.175 --> 42:04.383
Farewell, my friend.

42:08.925 --> 42:12.217
Sometimes I cry, it does me good.

42:13.383 --> 42:15.175
It's kind of like burping

42:15.342 --> 42:17.675
or farting. I like it.

42:18.883 --> 42:22.050
When I cry, I don't know why,

42:22.217 --> 42:25.050
but I want to leave this world.

42:26.800 --> 42:30.133
But I feel good in it, too.

42:52.550 --> 42:55.008
Hypnosis session.

42:59.592 --> 43:01.050
Visions

43:02.092 --> 43:03.717
from all sides.

43:36.467 --> 43:37.967
That's my daughter!

43:39.758 --> 43:40.967
My daughter!

43:41.717 --> 43:42.748
My daughter!

44:06.883 --> 44:08.342
Some mornings,

44:08.508 --> 44:10.258
I have trouble getting up.

44:16.217 --> 44:20.133
In the last two years,
my body has changed.

44:20.717 --> 44:22.717
It's better honed.

46:03.217 --> 46:06.008
What... What's going on?

46:08.883 --> 46:10.883
I didn't ask him to come back.

46:14.300 --> 46:15.925
Pain in the fuckin' ass!

46:16.258 --> 46:20.800
He hasn't understood that in my head,
I tell him what he has to do.

46:22.008 --> 46:25.175
We're gonna have
to set the record straight.

46:30.758 --> 46:32.842
He looks like a fat junkie.

46:33.425 --> 46:37.508
I'm sure he's back
on the drugs in secret.

46:49.717 --> 46:52.175
Hey, he smells of booze.

46:53.467 --> 46:56.342
So I'm not allowed to drink,

46:56.508 --> 46:58.550
and he gets blind drunk,

46:58.717 --> 47:00.008
the fat pig!

47:01.758 --> 47:04.300
I'm gonna fuck him up.

47:09.300 --> 47:11.092
Shitty totem!

47:13.758 --> 47:16.008
I could strangle him.

47:16.175 --> 47:17.842
I could do it like this.

47:39.425 --> 47:41.717
Then I'll have

47:41.883 --> 47:44.008
no father, no master.

47:45.675 --> 47:48.967
It would be the new era of TO.

47:51.175 --> 47:54.467
Once dead,
he won't be able to do anything.

47:56.925 --> 48:01.592
I'll shave him
because he has too much hair.

48:01.758 --> 48:04.508
And at last, I'll take

48:04.675 --> 48:06.383
all his strength.

48:07.050 --> 48:08.925
Hair is dirty.

48:09.092 --> 48:13.800
No more hair is hairless,
but hair is hairy!

48:13.967 --> 48:17.675
Hair is dirty, and hair is hair-raising.
Hair-raising!

48:19.967 --> 48:21.883
Yes, it's hair-raising.

48:35.800 --> 48:39.508
To become a peaceful person,

48:39.675 --> 48:42.592
I'm still going to have to learn,

48:43.717 --> 48:45.925
but I know what I want.

48:46.092 --> 48:49.425
When I want something,
I get it, no matter what.

48:53.758 --> 48:57.800
But there are two things on Earth
that aren't settled:

48:57.967 --> 49:00.842
fear and death.

49:02.425 --> 49:06.383
I believe in maternal life.

49:10.550 --> 49:12.467
He's nice, my daddy.

49:12.633 --> 49:15.383
That's how I like him,

49:15.550 --> 49:18.758
when he stops moving and talking.

49:19.800 --> 49:22.675
He always thought he was my master,

49:22.842 --> 49:26.508
but frankly,
if you see us next to each other,

49:26.675 --> 49:30.383
you realize
he has nothing to teach me anymore.

49:32.967 --> 49:34.258
Dad...

49:53.217 --> 49:55.883
My father has a big problem:

49:56.050 --> 49:59.008
he doesn't allow himself
to make mistakes.

49:59.175 --> 50:01.425
That's his problem.

50:01.592 --> 50:04.133
He's still a savage.

50:04.300 --> 50:07.467
At least that's how I see him.

50:15.050 --> 50:17.592
Ever since I was little,

50:18.008 --> 50:22.383
I've known
that nature is stronger than God.

50:22.550 --> 50:24.842
Nature is God.

50:25.008 --> 50:27.258
But God doesn't exist,

50:27.425 --> 50:29.800
there's only nature.

50:30.217 --> 50:33.050
Nature is new every day.

50:33.217 --> 50:36.050
That's why it impresses me.

50:38.175 --> 50:39.842
''O nature,

50:40.717 --> 50:42.592
cradle him warmly:

50:42.758 --> 50:44.383
''he is cold.''

51:06.758 --> 51:08.925
I'll tell you, Down's syndrome,

51:09.925 --> 51:12.175
that sooner or later...

51:15.925 --> 51:18.883
I'll fuck you, Down's syndrome.

51:19.133 --> 51:21.342
I'll fuck you, understand?

51:22.467 --> 51:24.675
I'm a samurai

51:25.467 --> 51:27.175
and I alone

51:27.925 --> 51:30.300
can become a lover.

51:50.289 --> 51:58.183
TO AND THE SNAKE

52:25.925 --> 52:28.800
I've become a free man.

52:30.633 --> 52:32.842
And like all free men,

52:33.175 --> 52:35.092
but they are rare,

52:36.008 --> 52:38.008
I'm free.

52:41.133 --> 52:43.758
I read something
in a book of my father's.

52:44.758 --> 52:46.342
It said:

52:47.217 --> 52:49.383
''I don't know where I come from,

52:50.050 --> 52:52.383
I know not who I am,

52:53.925 --> 52:56.425
I know not when I'll die.

52:57.675 --> 52:59.842
I know not where I'm going.

53:00.842 --> 53:03.800
''And I wonder that I am so happy.''

53:41.925 --> 53:45.217
Maybe this snake is here
to make me see

53:45.383 --> 53:48.592
that I am able to direct my life.

53:56.842 --> 53:59.925
I like his skin, his colors.

54:00.508 --> 54:04.425
He reminds me of a dame...
uh, a flame.

54:07.842 --> 54:13.300
And since I'm the one who directs
my life through my body,

54:13.550 --> 54:17.467
I'm the one who conjures up
what I need.

54:20.842 --> 54:25.592
Now I understand
that my mind and body

54:25.758 --> 54:27.467
are like a couple.

54:29.675 --> 54:32.592
This lets me see more clearly

54:32.758 --> 54:36.133
images that are still fuzzy
of my father.

54:37.550 --> 54:40.925
My father's problem is,
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

54:41.092 --> 54:43.842
So, at times, he's out of control

54:45.842 --> 54:48.967
and he tries to snog me.

54:53.592 --> 54:56.092
I know how to calm him down:

54:57.175 --> 55:01.050
I grab his testicles
and I crush them.

55:17.925 --> 55:21.967
In this house,
there's a really big problem.

55:22.467 --> 55:24.508
There are too many mice.

55:24.800 --> 55:26.925
They wake me up at night.

55:29.633 --> 55:32.925
When I look at these two little mice,

55:33.217 --> 55:35.550
they remind me of Jesus

55:35.717 --> 55:39.133
and his twin brother
who was kept hidden from us.

55:40.008 --> 55:42.550
Actually, Jesus died

55:42.717 --> 55:44.175
on the cross,

55:44.342 --> 55:46.550
and his twin brother is the one

55:46.717 --> 55:48.925
who rose from the dead.

55:56.092 --> 55:57.800
My snake

55:58.467 --> 56:01.675
will swallow the mice.

56:02.467 --> 56:05.800
So, I won't have to feed him.

56:06.675 --> 56:09.758
He'll get food and it'll be top.

56:10.217 --> 56:13.425
What's more, I could call him Top.

56:13.883 --> 56:16.508
We'll be TO and Top,

56:16.842 --> 56:20.217
two samurai,
without fear and beyond reproach.

56:26.133 --> 56:32.508
TO AND THE NINJA

56:47.342 --> 56:52.050
If I made a film,
my film would start with a wide shot.

56:52.217 --> 56:55.508
I'd be in the middle of the river.

56:56.300 --> 56:58.258
Suddenly, there'd be

56:58.425 --> 57:00.092
a super ninja.

57:01.800 --> 57:04.258
A shadow fighter.

57:05.217 --> 57:07.217
She'd have a distinct cry.

57:07.383 --> 57:09.717
TO!

57:12.050 --> 57:14.383
I found the perfect actress

57:14.550 --> 57:16.467
on the internet.

57:16.967 --> 57:20.925
She even agreed to dye her hair

57:21.092 --> 57:23.467
to get closer to the part.

57:24.592 --> 57:27.592
That's what I call
a successful casting.

57:30.467 --> 57:34.050
She would be a formidable opponent.

57:36.300 --> 57:39.758
There'll also be some science fiction,

57:39.925 --> 57:43.633
with a former <i>pétanque </i>player
reincarnated

57:43.800 --> 57:46.092
as a martial juggler.

57:46.967 --> 57:50.008
Well, it'll be great cinema.

57:54.258 --> 57:58.175
I'll also do the dubbing,
like in kung fu movies.

57:58.508 --> 58:02.383
And it'll be edited
with super-fast images

58:02.800 --> 58:06.467
so that the viewer goes:
''Wow, that's so cool!''

58:07.342 --> 58:11.967
Then, at some point,
we'll have to do close combat.

58:12.133 --> 58:17.092
That gives me an idea:
I'll add a porn scene.

58:17.467 --> 58:22.008
Especially as the sex
will make it go viral online.

58:22.175 --> 58:25.467
You never see the sexuality
of superheroes in movies

58:25.633 --> 58:27.425
and that's too bad.

58:28.467 --> 58:32.342
People today want to see amazing stuff,

58:33.050 --> 58:34.925
but very simple stuff.

58:36.675 --> 58:39.217
When I write the end of my film,

58:39.383 --> 58:43.175
I'll make the ninja stronger than me.

58:43.342 --> 58:47.842
That way I won't alienate the feminists,

58:48.217 --> 58:51.925
maybe the Catholics, if that...

58:52.592 --> 58:55.550
It'd be the end of TO the samurai,

58:55.717 --> 59:01.008
and the audience will love me
as they like to identify with losers.

59:01.925 --> 59:03.300
That's a fact.

59:25.883 --> 59:27.300
Today,

59:27.633 --> 59:32.133
I know exactly what I want to become:

59:33.925 --> 59:35.883
a great lover.

59:37.675 --> 59:39.758
That's what I need.

59:41.633 --> 59:44.383
That's what I'm made for.

59:46.592 --> 59:48.383
It's in my nature.

59:51.217 --> 59:54.883
And one must not go against nature.

1:00:00.342 --> 1:00:02.758
I don't want to fight anymore.

1:00:03.550 --> 1:00:07.758
The ultimate fight is not to fight.

1:00:10.050 --> 1:00:12.258
I must beat my anger,

1:00:12.425 --> 1:00:15.300
otherwise it will beat me.

1:00:18.883 --> 1:00:21.842
When I feel the anger coming back

1:00:22.008 --> 1:00:24.258
and intensifying,

1:00:24.425 --> 1:00:26.633
I must stop it dead.

1:00:27.508 --> 1:00:30.925
Deep down, I know it's not my anger.

1:00:31.592 --> 1:00:33.342
It doesn't belong to me.

1:00:34.467 --> 1:00:36.592
It's a foreign body.

1:00:38.758 --> 1:00:41.133
I must lose my habits,

1:00:41.300 --> 1:00:43.467
not know what I'm doing

1:00:43.633 --> 1:00:44.925
and do it anyway.

1:00:45.508 --> 1:00:50.342
I know
that everything inside me moves

1:00:50.508 --> 1:00:51.758
all the time.

1:00:51.925 --> 1:00:55.592
And that death is
when the movement stops.

1:00:57.925 --> 1:01:01.800
To think I wanted to be a samurai...

1:01:01.967 --> 1:01:03.383
What a jerk.

1:01:06.883 --> 1:01:11.633
My father once told me
the story of the Shakti,

1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:14.175
the Indian snake-woman

1:01:14.342 --> 1:01:18.008
that dwells in the body
of every human being.

1:01:19.133 --> 1:01:24.008
It is she who gives love
a chance to exist.

1:01:26.592 --> 1:01:29.675
She keeps dancing inside me,

1:01:29.842 --> 1:01:32.425
and her dance soothes me.

1:01:33.592 --> 1:01:40.925
TO AND THE EMPRESS

1:01:46.758 --> 1:01:49.050
By going inside me,

1:01:49.217 --> 1:01:53.217
I should be able to discover
this snake-woman.

1:01:56.800 --> 1:01:59.675
She could caress me.

1:01:59.842 --> 1:02:02.967
I like to feel touched.

1:02:04.758 --> 1:02:07.383
The contact of skin...

1:02:07.592 --> 1:02:09.092
is beautiful.

1:02:11.675 --> 1:02:15.175
My father also told me about women

1:02:15.342 --> 1:02:17.883
who initiated young virgins.

1:02:20.592 --> 1:02:24.008
But I see her more as

1:02:24.175 --> 1:02:25.925
an empress.

1:02:28.258 --> 1:02:30.633
I understand all she says to me

1:02:30.967 --> 1:02:34.050
because she inspires desire in me

1:02:34.383 --> 1:02:37.967
and a life of simple pleasures.

1:02:38.508 --> 1:02:40.550
For life is short.

1:02:42.467 --> 1:02:45.592
With her, I will suffer no more.

1:03:05.217 --> 1:03:06.633
Would I want

1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:08.758
to add moles?

1:03:09.633 --> 1:03:12.008
It doesn't matter

1:03:12.175 --> 1:03:16.383
because the snake-woman
can take on any shape.

1:03:19.508 --> 1:03:23.883
It's funny because she's dressed
exactly like my snake

1:03:24.050 --> 1:03:27.425
with the same spots and colors.

1:03:28.342 --> 1:03:33.633
She could give me a session
of cranial osteopathy

1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:38.092
to help me get my<i> Qi</i>
to circulate better.

1:03:38.758 --> 1:03:40.925
Oh, I hear

1:03:41.092 --> 1:03:42.758
a bell in my head.

1:03:43.508 --> 1:03:46.092
What is she up to?

1:03:58.217 --> 1:04:02.008
I'd like to be a spaghetti
between her fingers,

1:04:03.050 --> 1:04:04.300
have her cut me up

1:04:04.467 --> 1:04:06.300
like a little suckling pig.

1:04:07.758 --> 1:04:11.133
Yes, I'd like her to devour me.

1:04:13.675 --> 1:04:16.217
What I need is to be

1:04:16.383 --> 1:04:18.425
loved and watched.

1:04:35.883 --> 1:04:37.425
All is transformation.

1:04:37.592 --> 1:04:39.175
All is transformation.

1:04:39.342 --> 1:04:40.883
All is alliteration.

1:04:41.050 --> 1:04:42.633
All is eradication.

1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:44.425
All is transformation.

1:04:44.592 --> 1:04:46.342
All is transformation.

1:04:47.133 --> 1:04:52.675
It's entirely conceivable for you
to have a normal sex life.

1:04:53.300 --> 1:04:55.967
For that, you need a live-in wife.

1:04:56.133 --> 1:05:00.758
I've found you a very beautiful one.
A real pro.

1:05:01.508 --> 1:05:05.258
She's a Moldovan of Sri Lankan origin.

1:05:06.050 --> 1:05:09.633
She has dark skin, the way you like.

1:05:10.925 --> 1:05:13.800
You'll see, she's a ''pretty plant''.

1:05:15.925 --> 1:05:18.758
She's hairless, just the way you like.

1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:21.592
But she has a pimp...

1:05:21.967 --> 1:05:26.633
And Boris isn't very smart.

1:05:27.425 --> 1:05:31.008
But with money,
there's always a solution.

1:05:31.717 --> 1:05:34.758
I'll give them my card number.

1:05:37.092 --> 1:05:39.842
I'll deal with the transaction.

1:05:40.008 --> 1:05:44.050
Every night, she'll masturbate you
before you go to sleep.

1:05:44.217 --> 1:05:48.883
I think I could get a month's trial
and 50% off.

1:06:02.175 --> 1:06:04.800
I know that it is my power of thought

1:06:05.383 --> 1:06:08.425
that gives real life its reality.

1:06:09.550 --> 1:06:11.800
It's like with my father,

1:06:11.967 --> 1:06:15.175
I decided to stop thinking about him,

1:06:15.342 --> 1:06:17.925
so he's no longer here.

1:06:19.508 --> 1:06:22.842
I mustn't stop thinking about her.

1:06:23.258 --> 1:06:27.300
I need to concentrate
on the fact that she's here

1:06:27.467 --> 1:06:29.925
and she is very real.

1:06:30.092 --> 1:06:33.092
Otherwise, she will disappear.

1:06:34.467 --> 1:06:37.550
And if she stopped thinking about me,

1:06:37.717 --> 1:06:40.925
then I too would disappear

1:06:41.592 --> 1:06:43.925
and I would become her.

1:06:44.092 --> 1:06:47.092
And that would be a very good thing

1:06:47.967 --> 1:06:51.842
because what I want
is to stop thinking.

1:06:52.425 --> 1:06:54.300
Especially as I imagine

1:06:54.467 --> 1:06:58.050
that others don't always think
of beautiful things.

1:06:58.217 --> 1:07:00.050
And sometimes,

1:07:00.217 --> 1:07:02.425
we feel sad,

1:07:03.008 --> 1:07:04.633
or depressed,

1:07:05.300 --> 1:07:07.133
without knowing why.

1:07:09.425 --> 1:07:12.300
But it's joy I'm looking for

1:07:12.467 --> 1:07:14.925
because I want to reinvent love.

1:07:16.675 --> 1:07:18.467
Tweet, tweet, tweet,

1:07:18.633 --> 1:07:20.092
like a little bird.

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:22.550
It flies here and there.

1:07:23.258 --> 1:07:24.633
It's so funny.

1:07:39.967 --> 1:07:42.967
I like being a snake-woman.

1:07:43.675 --> 1:07:47.175
In fact, we should be both,
man and woman

1:07:47.425 --> 1:07:48.883
at the same time.

1:08:01.050 --> 1:08:04.592
I just met
the reincarnation of Bob Marley.

1:08:04.758 --> 1:08:08.883
Bob was unlucky.
He deserved nirvana,

1:08:09.050 --> 1:08:12.008
not to come back
as such a dumb dog.

1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:18.258
He said: ''I'm Bob Marley''
and he sang me a Bob Marley song,

1:08:18.425 --> 1:08:20.258
and I recognized the song.

1:08:29.508 --> 1:08:31.508
''The problem is,'' he told me,

1:08:31.675 --> 1:08:34.758
''when I was Bob, I was cool.

1:08:34.925 --> 1:08:38.967
All day, I smoked super ganja,

1:08:39.133 --> 1:08:43.383
but now if you move,
I'll eat you!''

1:08:47.258 --> 1:08:50.342
I can't believe
that a Rasta who preaches love

1:08:51.050 --> 1:08:55.675
wants to eat a guy with Down's syndrome
who's looking for love.

1:08:58.217 --> 1:09:01.050
Finally he left me alone.

1:09:01.675 --> 1:09:04.050
Hey Bob, fuck you, bro!

1:09:23.175 --> 1:09:24.675
Well, well...

1:09:24.842 --> 1:09:27.133
my father has turned into a trout.

1:09:28.133 --> 1:09:30.092
He's a hell of a magician.

1:09:31.217 --> 1:09:34.092
I must go back into the cave.

1:09:36.217 --> 1:09:41.300
That's where she's waiting for me.
But not her, the other one. The Shakti,

1:09:41.467 --> 1:09:46.258
with her round, smooth,
almost elastic flesh,

1:09:48.050 --> 1:09:50.967
like honey dripping on honey.

1:09:52.258 --> 1:09:54.633
It's not blood that circulates

1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:58.508
inside her.
It's the sperm of the male.

1:10:00.717 --> 1:10:03.342
Her mouth, like a sucker,

1:10:04.425 --> 1:10:06.133
drives me crazy.

1:10:06.425 --> 1:10:11.217
Our two mouths unite,
our two bodies entwine.

1:10:12.133 --> 1:10:16.467
There's also humor between us.

1:10:45.050 --> 1:10:47.508
We will finally have recovered

1:10:47.925 --> 1:10:50.342
the naive eroticism

1:10:50.508 --> 1:10:54.133
that men should never have destroyed.

1:12:44.508 --> 1:12:47.217
I didn't want you
to come back so soon.

1:12:52.383 --> 1:12:54.300
You could have let me know.

1:13:12.092 --> 1:13:13.717
My name is TO.

1:13:14.717 --> 1:13:20.008
A centipede better not come and ask
my snake why he has no legs.

1:13:21.425 --> 1:13:24.633
My snake goes faster than a turtle,

1:13:25.342 --> 1:13:27.800
faster than a galloping horse.

1:13:29.508 --> 1:13:33.258
I'm going to change my name.
From now on, I'll be called

1:13:33.425 --> 1:13:35.342
Floating Hare

1:13:35.925 --> 1:13:38.217
or Trail Fox

1:13:38.425 --> 1:13:41.383
or Drunken Monkey.

1:14:48.258 --> 1:14:50.842
I must no longer resist.

1:14:52.258 --> 1:14:55.175
I must accept without fear.

1:14:55.675 --> 1:14:58.883
I am looking for a world.

1:14:59.050 --> 1:15:00.467
There it is...

1:15:00.967 --> 1:15:02.675
in front of me.

1:15:03.550 --> 1:15:05.342
And this world...

1:15:06.217 --> 1:15:09.467
is a multi-world.

1:15:10.425 --> 1:15:14.383
It is vast, and I find my place...

1:15:17.175 --> 1:15:20.383
by becoming a magnet and lover

1:15:20.550 --> 1:15:23.633
of all that surrounds me.

1:15:38.050 --> 1:15:41.258
I like the idea of a happy nothingness.

1:15:58.217 --> 1:16:01.758
I will become Shiva Nataraja,

1:16:01.925 --> 1:16:05.967
the king of dance with his Shakti.

1:16:06.133 --> 1:16:09.758
And my shadow will embrace the earth.

1:16:09.925 --> 1:16:12.675
And it will remain,
even after my death.

1:16:13.342 --> 1:16:16.842
My shadow will dance
all over the earth.

1:16:35.758 --> 1:16:39.342
''Who are these snakes for,
hissing on your heads?''

1:17:07.425 --> 1:17:10.967
Wisdom is when you're empty,

1:17:11.550 --> 1:17:13.092
thoughtless.

1:17:14.467 --> 1:17:17.092
You're just living in the present...

1:17:19.050 --> 1:17:20.800
available.

1:17:31.717 --> 1:17:36.925
I now know that I am the inventor
of my mental space.

1:17:37.550 --> 1:17:42.092
The inside of my brain
is an infinite space.

1:17:44.592 --> 1:17:46.467
I no longer need time.

1:17:46.633 --> 1:17:49.717
I'm suspended in space.

1:17:51.925 --> 1:17:54.175
But this place I'm taking up,

1:17:54.342 --> 1:17:58.758
does it mean
that I'm becoming the space now, too?

1:18:03.888 --> 1:18:11.873
TO AND THE STRANGER

1:18:17.008 --> 1:18:19.217
You had a nightmare last night?

1:18:21.008 --> 1:18:22.217
Yes.

1:18:23.300 --> 1:18:25.008
I had a dream.
I was 90.

1:18:25.633 --> 1:18:29.008
I was standing on the top
of a large circus tent.

1:18:30.133 --> 1:18:33.967
I shouted at a group of people
below, barely visible.

1:18:34.508 --> 1:18:36.633
I shouted at them that I was 9.

1:18:37.217 --> 1:18:39.467
I could hear their whispers.

1:18:41.383 --> 1:18:42.508
They thought

1:18:42.675 --> 1:18:44.175
I was insane.

1:18:45.883 --> 1:18:48.092
I showed them
my body's dexterity.

1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:52.383
My energy had become
a smooth, happy dance.

1:18:53.008 --> 1:18:56.342
Despite my great age,
I had kept a childlike smile.

1:18:57.675 --> 1:19:00.883
My joy was great, unquestionable.

1:19:57.133 --> 1:20:00.258
Something has to happen,

1:20:00.425 --> 1:20:03.758
something has to change,

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:07.175
and this something is me.

1:20:08.633 --> 1:20:11.675
I have to reinvent my life.

1:20:11.842 --> 1:20:18.008
And to do so, I have to take
the supreme risk to change...

1:20:20.133 --> 1:20:26.425
The risk of complete imbalance.

1:23:09.914 --> 1:23:17.851
TO AND HIS OTHER HALF

1:35:51.008 --> 1:35:54.008
Subtitles: J. Miller, a.s.i.f.
