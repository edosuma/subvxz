00:57.680 --> 01:00.194
The thing I've
been asking myself is

01:00.360 --> 01:04.638
what kind of sick individual
names a street Edgewood Way

01:04.720 --> 01:07.553
and he put it half a mile away
from Edgewood Lane?

01:08.320 --> 01:09.355
Huh?

01:10.880 --> 01:12.074
It's crazy.

01:12.240 --> 01:18.952
You got me out here in this creepy,
confusing ass suburb.

01:20.760 --> 01:25.038
I'm serious, though.
I feel like a sore thumb out here.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.753
All right, baby. All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.160
See you.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.957
Okay,
so this is Rhine Ave.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.434
It's like a fucking
hedge maze out here.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.440
East...

01:47.280 --> 01:51.592
Keep going straight and then
I think it said a left on...

01:51.760 --> 01:53.910
What was that?
Peacock?

01:54.080 --> 01:58.073
Go straight and a left on...

02:13.720 --> 02:14.869
Okay.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.871
All right,
just keep on walking, bruh.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.758
Don't do nothin' stupid.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.273
Just keep on...

02:22.800 --> 02:25.553
Fuck this. I'mma fucking
go the other way I came.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.628
Not today. Not me.

02:29.520 --> 02:33.229
You know how they like to do
motherfuckers out here, man. I'm gone.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.072
Yo... Come on, brother,
this is...

02:43.160 --> 02:45.196
Yo! Yo! Hey!

06:39.400 --> 06:40.992
Sid, Sid, Sid.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.308
How's it goin' over there?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.400
Good.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.031
You got your toothbrush?

06:48.520 --> 06:49.520
Check.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.950
Do you have your deodorant?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.519
Check.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.358
Do you have your cozy clothes?

06:56.080 --> 06:57.229
Got that.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.718
Can you give me
a minute, Sid?

07:01.960 --> 07:04.190
We gotta pry something
out of your dad.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
What?

07:16.080 --> 07:19.038
Do they know I'm black?

07:21.600 --> 07:22.600
No.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.189
Should they?

07:28.960 --> 07:34.318
It seems like it's something
you might wanna, you know,

07:36.320 --> 07:37.355
mention.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.716
"Mom and Dad,
my black boyfriend

07:40.800 --> 07:42.358
"will be coming
up this weekend

07:42.520 --> 07:44.080
"and I just don't
want you to be shocked

07:45.080 --> 07:46.559
"that he's a black man."

07:48.680 --> 07:50.216
You said I was the first
black guy you ever dated.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.240
Yeah, so what?

07:51.320 --> 07:53.390
Yeah, so this is uncharted
territory for them.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.392
You know, I don't wanna get chased
off the lawn with a shotgun.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.959
You're not going to.
First of all,

07:58.160 --> 08:01.072
my dad would've voted for Obama
a third time if he could've.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.557
Like, the love is so real.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.176
I'm only telling you
that 'cause he's definitely

08:05.200 --> 08:06.599
gonna wanna talk
to you about that.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.188
And it will definitely fucking suck.

08:09.360 --> 08:13.194
But that's because he's a lame
dad more than anything else.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.831
They are not racist.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.791
All right.
I would've told you.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.791
I wouldn't be
bringing you home to them.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Think about that for, like, two seconds.

08:24.880 --> 08:25.915
I'm thinkin'.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.075
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.193
No, no, no.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.191
Come on, I'm a grown man.
No way.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.280
You broke my cigarette.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.000
Seriously, you just
threw it out a window?

08:49.040 --> 08:51.416
Just like a dollar. You basically
threw a dollar out the window. Great.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.336
That was a dollar you decided
to spend on nicotine.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.429
Yeah.
Tobacco.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.192
Hold on, I gotta call Rod.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.839
Oh, Rod.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.433
Don't do that.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.475
'Sup?

09:03.720 --> 09:04.755
Yo, you at work?

09:04.880 --> 09:06.199
Yeah, yeah,
I'm at work.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.669
Look, Chris,
tell me this, okay?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.034
How can I get in trouble

09:10.200 --> 09:14.034
for patting down an old lady?
It's standard procedure.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.470
Gary just think 'cause
an elderly bitch is elderly,

09:16.640 --> 09:18.312
she can't hijack no
motherfucking plane.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.080
C, wait, wait, wait.
I know you laughin'.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.593
I'm serious, man.
The next 9/11

09:21.720 --> 09:23.199
is gonna be on
some geriatric shit.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.395
Straight up.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.199
Look, man,
thanks for looking after Sid this weekend.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.918
Remember, no human food.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.399
He's got IBS.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.000
Damn, C.
Give me some type of credit.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.991
Okay, I don't forget shit.
You do.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.752
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.480
No, I accept your apology.
It's all good.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.239
How Little
Miss Rosie doin'?

09:40.520 --> 09:41.873
She's good. She's driving.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.155
Can I talk to him?
No.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.753
I'd like to talk
to him, please.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.753
Hold on, hold on.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.153
- Hi, Rod!
- Now, look here.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.920
You know you picked
the wrong guy, right?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.873
Yeah, of course I know that.
This is all just a ploy to get to you.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.696
It's not too late for us.
Okay, get your own girl.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.720
Goddamn.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.856
She's all mad at you 'cause
you never take my advice.

09:58.880 --> 09:59.880
Like what?

09:59.920 --> 10:01.911
Like don't go to
a white girl's parents' house.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.360
What's she doin'?
Lickin' your balls or somethin'?

10:04.920 --> 10:06.960
Yeah, bye.
You know what I'm sayin', Chris?

10:07.680 --> 10:08.680
Chris.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.680
Chri...

10:11.960 --> 10:13.439
This motherfucker
hung up on me.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.360
You're jealous.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.271
I'm not jealous.
I made you jealous?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.120
I'm not jealous of Rod.
It's Rod!

10:35.800 --> 10:37.950
Fuck. Are you okay?

10:38.120 --> 10:39.216
Yeah, that scared
the shit outta me.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.309
You?
Yeah, I'm okay.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.400
All right.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.549
Oh, my God.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.558
Fuck.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.838
Stay here.
What?

11:04.480 --> 11:05.833
What are you doing?

11:08.520 --> 11:10.112
I don't know.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.637
Well, maybe he's gone,
you know?

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
Chris.

12:09.640 --> 12:13.155
So, in the future, the number to
call is Animal Control Services.

12:13.320 --> 12:17.074
Yes. Sorry about that.
I was just disoriented.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.034
So you guys
coming up from the city?

12:20.200 --> 12:23.078
Yeah, yeah. My parents are
from the Lake Pontaco area.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.231
We're just heading up there
for the weekend. Hmm.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.837
Sir, can I see
your license, please?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.069
Wait, why?

12:29.240 --> 12:31.196
Yeah.
I have state ID.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.555
No, no, no.
He wasn't driving.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.234
I didn't ask who was driving.
I asked to see his ID.

12:36.440 --> 12:39.671
Yeah, why? That doesn't
make any sense. Here.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.936
No, no, no. Fuck that. You
don't have to give him your ID

12:41.960 --> 12:43.256
'cause you haven't
done anything wrong.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.759
Baby, baby, it's okay.
Come on.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.992
Any time there is an incident,
we have every right to ask...

12:48.120 --> 12:49.120
That's bullshit.

12:50.760 --> 12:51.760
Ma'am...

12:57.240 --> 12:58.856
Everything all right, Ryan?

13:01.440 --> 13:02.953
Yeah, I'm good.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.075
Get that headlight fixed.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.635
And that mirror.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.119
Thank you, Officer.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.315
What?

13:23.520 --> 13:24.919
That was hot.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.799
Well, I'm not gonna
let anyone fuck with my man.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.912
I see that.
Okay.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.159
We're here.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.519
It's the groundskeeper.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.160
Are you ready?

14:13.480 --> 14:14.595
Hi!

14:14.720 --> 14:15.835
My little girl!
Come here!

14:17.040 --> 14:19.918
How are you? I love you too.
I missed you.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.513
This is my dad, Dean.
This is Chris.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.079
Call me Mr. Armitage.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.376
Of course.
How you doin'?

14:24.400 --> 14:27.358
I'm kiddin'! You call me Dean.
And you hug me, my man.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.033
How are ya?
I'm good. How are you?

14:29.200 --> 14:30.519
We're huggers.
Yes.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.880
This is my mom.
This is Chris.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.353
Hi, welcome.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.352
Nice to meet you.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.272
Your father gets
really excited, but...

14:38.880 --> 14:40.916
Anyway, yeah.
I'm Missy.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.031
Yes. Come on in.
Please, welcome. Inside.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.240
So how was your drive in?

14:51.360 --> 14:53.828
It was fine.
We actually hit a deer.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.558
What?
Oh, no.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.073
Is it dead?
Yeah.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.071
That's horrible.
Are you guys all right?

14:59.240 --> 15:01.276
Yeah.
It just fruck us out.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.400
It did?

15:02.440 --> 15:04.376
Yeah. It came outta nowhere.
We got it pretty good.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.119
Yeah, it must have
frucked you out, big time.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.556
Frucking weird. Well, you
know what I say?

15:10.760 --> 15:13.433
I say one down, a couple
hundred thousand to go.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.520
Dean.
Dad.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.896
No, I don't mean to get on my
high horse, but I'm telling ya,

15:16.920 --> 15:20.071
I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it.
They're taking over.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.628
They're like rats.
They're destroying the ecosystem.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.056
I see a dead deer on the side
of the road, I think to myself,

15:25.080 --> 15:26.433
"That's a start."

15:26.960 --> 15:28.279
I don't even
understand that.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.400
I'm sorry.
I'm just sayin'.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.711
You know what, I am grateful
for what you've done today.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.273
I don't like 'em.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.509
We got that.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.635
Okay.
Yeah.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.792
All right, you guys
look so wiped out.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.592
Yeah, a little.
Yeah.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.272
So how long has this
been going on? This...

15:45.760 --> 15:46.760
This thang?

15:48.640 --> 15:49.914
How long?

15:50.840 --> 15:51.840
Four months.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.555
Four months?

15:54.400 --> 15:56.470
Mmm.
Five months, actually.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.633
She's right, I'm wrong.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.950
Attaboy. Better get
used to saying that.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.759
Please, I'm so sorry.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.956
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
She's right, I'm wrong.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.600
See?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.116
Does he have an off button?
This is exhausting.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.800
I know.
I wanna give you a tour.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.638
They just got...
Can we unpack first?

16:14.800 --> 16:17.314
You wanna unpack?
Before the tour?

16:19.200 --> 16:22.590
This is Missy's office.
She takes appointments in there.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.079
She's a therapist,
right?

16:24.160 --> 16:25.309
Psychiatrist, yeah.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.708
Turns out people up here

16:26.800 --> 16:28.616
are just as messed up in the
head as they are in the city.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.914
This is Jeremy.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.276
That's Rose's little brother.
There he is.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.157
I've heard stories.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.673
Yeah, I bet you have.

16:35.880 --> 16:39.190
He's studying medicine now.
Wants to be just like his old man.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.952
You'll meet him.
All right. Cool.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.991
I picked these up in Bali.

16:46.080 --> 16:51.393
It's pretty eclectic.
I'm a traveler and I can't help it.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.193
I keep bringing
souvenirs back.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.713
It's such
a privilege to be able

16:57.840 --> 16:59.398
to experience
another person's culture.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.840
You know what I'm saying?
Mmm-hmm.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.678
Oh, you're gonna
love this.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.397
My dad's claim to fame.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.592
He was beat by Jesse Owens

17:07.680 --> 17:11.194
in the qualifying round for
the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.376
Those are the ones where...
Owens won in front of Hitler.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.958
Yeah, what a moment.
What a moment.

17:15.119 --> 17:19.511
I mean, Hitler's up there with all
his perfect Aryan race bullshit.

17:19.720 --> 17:20.868
This black dude
comes along,

17:20.960 --> 17:23.076
proves him wrong in front
of the entire world.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.388
Amazing.

17:24.599 --> 17:25.874
Tough break for
your dad though.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.108
Yeah.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.591
He almost got over it.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.949
That's the basement.
We had to seal it up.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.951
We got some black
mold down there.

17:36.400 --> 17:40.109
My mother loved her kitchen,
so we keep a piece of her in here.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.799
Georgina, this is Chris.
This is Rose's boyfriend.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.880
Hi.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.039
Hello.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.593
The garbage goes
under the sink,

17:51.760 --> 17:56.231
and now for the
pièce de résistance,

18:01.440 --> 18:02.759
the field of play.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
I love it.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.638
The nearest house
is across the lake.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.239
It's total privacy.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.913
I know what
you're thinking.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.120
What?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.428
Come on, I get it.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.034
White family,
black servants.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.189
It's a total cliché.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.480
I wasn't gonna
take it there.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.272
Well, you didn't have to.
Believe me.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.794
No.

18:35.120 --> 18:39.352
We hired Georgina and Walter
to help care for my parents.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.360
When they died,

18:43.120 --> 18:46.351
I couldn't bear to
let them go. I mean...

18:46.520 --> 18:49.671
But, boy, I hate
the way it looks.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.232
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

18:54.960 --> 18:59.192
By the way, I would have voted for
Obama for a third term if I could.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.590
Best president in my lifetime.
Hands down.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.153
I agree.
Yeah.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.471
So what do your
parents do, Chris?

19:13.960 --> 19:15.473
Uh...

19:15.560 --> 19:17.312
My dad wasn't
really in the picture.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.232
My mom passed
away when I was 11.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.391
Oh, I'm sorry.
How did she die?

19:21.560 --> 19:22.788
A hit and run.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.114
That's awful.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.316
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
You were young.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.109
Actually, I don't remember a
lot from that time, so...

19:31.920 --> 19:34.115
Well, that's okay. We don't
have to talk about that.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.673
You smoke, Chris?

19:41.680 --> 19:42.680
Mmm-hmm.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.400
You jonesing
a little bit over there, huh?

19:44.480 --> 19:45.480
I'm quitting.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.359
Dad, this is why I don't bring
people to the house anymore.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.034
That's okay.
We're not judging. We're not.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.679
That's a nasty habit,
though.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.880
You should have Missy take
care of that for you.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.640
How?

19:58.840 --> 19:59.840
Hypnosis.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.918
She developed a method, and I'm
telling you, it works like a charm.

20:04.520 --> 20:05.520
Wow, um...

20:06.040 --> 20:07.176
Some people
don't want strangers

20:07.200 --> 20:08.416
messing around in
their heads, guys.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.876
Listen, Chris, I thought
it was total bullshit.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.315
I smoked cigarettes
for 15 years.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.755
I loved every
goddamn puff I took.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.114
She puts me under once...

20:18.880 --> 20:20.760
The sight of a cigarette
makes me want to vomit.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.719
Okay, fall back, Dean.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.950
It's a service we provide.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.152
I'm good, actually.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.336
Yes.
Thank you, though.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.376
Well, smoker or not,
we're thrilled to have you up here

20:33.400 --> 20:35.072
for the big get-together.
Yeah.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.071
Wait, holy shit.
That's this weekend?

20:37.240 --> 20:38.240
Yes, this weekend.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.913
What get-together?
Oh, my God.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.354
Thanks, George.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.752
It's Rose's grandfather's party.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.158
My dad would throw
a shindig once a year.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.038
Get all his friends together,

20:50.200 --> 20:52.236
bocce ball, badminton...

20:52.400 --> 20:54.516
Wait, why didn't you
guys tell me about this?

20:54.960 --> 20:56.951
Well, it's the same day
every year, sweetheart.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.758
- No, it's not.
- Um...

20:59.080 --> 21:00.354
It is.
Actually, it is.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.440
Is it really?

21:01.480 --> 21:02.856
- Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong.
- Yeah.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.429
We just kept it up because after
they died, it felt like...

21:07.200 --> 21:08.918
We keep them close to us.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.439
Yeah, they're still with us.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.830
I just wanted to
have a chill weekend.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.593
Sounds like fun, actually.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.280
Oh, Georgina.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.189
I'm so sorry.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.355
That's okay.

21:21.040 --> 21:24.237
Why don't you go lay down?
Just get some rest.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.030
Yes, I think I will.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.919
Good.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.949
My God, it must be very...

21:39.120 --> 21:40.439
'Sup, fam!

21:41.120 --> 21:42.314
Hey, Jer-Bear.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.072
Hi, darling.
Hey, buddy.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.790
Nobody answers
the door around here?

21:47.720 --> 21:48.869
Hey, Rosie.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.576
Why would I lie, huh?

21:50.600 --> 21:51.600
I love it!

21:54.520 --> 21:56.750
Did she tell you about
her toenail collection?

21:56.960 --> 21:58.439
What?
Oh, my God!

21:58.920 --> 22:01.753
She used to bite 'em off, suck on 'em,
and save 'em in a jewelry box.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.880
No, I didn't. I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.160
That is so disgusting.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.355
I fucking hate you.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.078
Okay, here's a good one.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.436
Uh, let me set the scene.
It was our junior year.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.279
Rose has a crush on this guy,
Conner Garfield.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.480
Conner Garfield.

22:17.560 --> 22:18.675
No. Mom?

22:18.840 --> 22:20.990
No, Jeremy, stop.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.917
No, no, these are good.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.115
I want to hear them.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.038
Yeah, Rose,
where are your manners?

22:26.240 --> 22:28.276
Our guest wants to
hear the stories, please.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.360
Thank you.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.153
So Conner's from my lacrosse team, right?
Huge kid, like 6'3".

22:32.320 --> 22:34.788
And he's pretty dumb, right?
So we threw this party.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.029
You threw a party.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.476
I think my parents
were in Greece or something.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.995
We raided their liquor cabinet
and we're all shit-faced.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.160
Like 15 of us.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.470
Oh, my God. Tell me
this isn't true, Rose.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.360
Yeah.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.917
I filled the liquor
bottles with water...

22:51.480 --> 22:52.595
And let me finish?

22:52.840 --> 22:55.195
Uh-huh. Go ahead.
I'm curious.

22:55.280 --> 23:01.116
So I'm upstairs hooking up with the
hottest girl in class, Jean Deely.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.200
Oh, God.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.878
You realize you're
coming off as, like,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.558
the world's
biggest douchebag, right?

23:07.960 --> 23:11.270
So Conner starts banging
on the bathroom door, right?

23:11.480 --> 23:12.879
I open it

23:13.040 --> 23:15.838
and blood's gushing from his mouth.
And he's screaming,

23:16.040 --> 23:18.474
"Your sister
bit my fucking tongue off!"

23:18.640 --> 23:20.278
- You bit him?
- What?

23:20.440 --> 23:23.159
Okay, to be fair,
it was my first kiss

23:23.320 --> 23:26.073
and he slipped some tongue
and I was not expecting it.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.913
It was a reflex.
I'm sorry.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.275
A reflex that I have
since gotten rid of.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.896
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you better be careful.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.309
Yeah, I'm very careful now.

23:36.320 --> 23:41.440
I'm gonna go get dessert. And, Dean,
maybe clean it up just a little bit?

23:47.600 --> 23:50.512
So, Chris, what's your sport?
Football? Baseball?

23:50.880 --> 23:52.791
Basketball, mostly, I guess.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.234
You an MMA fan?

23:54.800 --> 23:55.869
Dude.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.080
"Dude" what?

23:58.600 --> 23:59.600
What?

23:59.760 --> 24:03.150
Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone
else have the floor for a second?

24:05.280 --> 24:07.430
You're dating
my sister, right?

24:09.440 --> 24:11.829
He's dating my sister.
You had your chance.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.358
I can't get to know
the guy?

24:18.480 --> 24:19.674
You mean like UFC?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.360
Yes.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.118
Nah, too brutal for me.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.191
You ever get into
street fights as a kid?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.594
I did judo after school,
first grade.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.176
Aw...
You should've seen me.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.269
Judo?

24:38.200 --> 24:40.794
'Cause with your frame
and your genetic makeup,

24:41.360 --> 24:43.635
if you really
pushed your body,

24:45.000 --> 24:46.433
and I mean really train,
you know?

24:46.960 --> 24:50.316
No pussyfooting around.
You'd be a fucking beast.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.798
Carrot cake!

24:53.880 --> 24:55.313
Ooh!
Hi.

24:55.960 --> 24:56.960
Carrot cake.

24:58.520 --> 24:59.555
What did I miss?

25:01.760 --> 25:03.318
A whole bunch of nothing.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.473
Just talking about sports.
Right?

25:06.560 --> 25:07.560
Yeah.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
That sounds good.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.397
So the thing
about jiu-jitsu is

25:14.280 --> 25:17.590
strength doesn't matter, right?
It's all about this.

25:19.520 --> 25:23.035
It's a strategic game
like chess.

25:23.720 --> 25:27.508
It's all about being two,
three, four moves ahead.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.480
Cool.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.439
Stand up.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.875
Jeremy, no karate
at the dinner table.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.160
It's not karate, Ma.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.595
Yo, I got a rule.
No play-fighting with drunk dudes.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.680
I don't play,
I'm just...

25:46.840 --> 25:48.159
Jeremy.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.077
I wasn't gonna hurt him.

26:08.760 --> 26:12.036
He was gonna put you
in a fucking headlock.

26:12.560 --> 26:13.788
What is his problem?

26:13.960 --> 26:16.030
He has never treated
any of my boyfriends that way.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.394
Ever, ever, ever.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.480
Mmm-hmm.

26:18.760 --> 26:22.070
Oh, my God. And then my dad
with the "my man" stuff.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.708
"My man, my man."

26:23.880 --> 26:27.156
I don't think he's ever heard that
or said it. And now he just...

26:27.320 --> 26:28.435
It's all he says.

26:28.560 --> 26:29.595
Yup.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.716
Oh, and my mom being
rude to Georgina?

26:31.800 --> 26:34.075
What the fuck was that about?
That was so crazy.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.874
I mean...

26:38.960 --> 26:41.315
How are they different
than that cop?

26:43.600 --> 26:45.000
That's the fucking
bummer of it all.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.320
Mmm-hmm.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.280
Mmm-hmm?

26:50.600 --> 26:53.353
Anything more
you'd like to add?

26:57.320 --> 26:59.117
I told you so, like...

27:03.440 --> 27:04.793
I didn't want to say it.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.960
I didn't want to say it.
I didn't want to say that.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.072
I don't like being wrong.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.240
I've noticed that.

27:10.320 --> 27:11.320
But I am sorry.

27:11.520 --> 27:14.080
No, no, no.
Wait. Come here. Come here.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.878
I'm sorry.
This sucks.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.519
What? Why you saying "sorry"?

27:18.760 --> 27:21.035
'Cause I brought you here and
I'm related to all of them.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.753
No, it's fine.
It's fine.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.753
Yeah?
Yeah?

27:24.880 --> 27:26.836
Uh-huh.
How are you so calm?

27:27.040 --> 27:28.996
Honestly, it's nothing.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.030
I like you on your
racial flow, though.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.992
Is this a racial flow?
Racial flow.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.200
Am I feeling
a racial flow?

27:36.360 --> 27:38.032
Yeah, you're
feeling racially flowy.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.030
Oh, fuck. The party.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.109
How bad can it be?

27:56.320 --> 27:58.788
They are so white.
Like, so white!

27:58.960 --> 27:59.995
It's all good.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.275
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.271
You know,
with my genetic makeup,

28:05.440 --> 28:07.317
shit gonna go down.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.232
I'm a beast.
I'm a beast!

30:59.760 --> 31:01.671
Do you realize how
dangerous smoking is?

31:07.880 --> 31:08.915
Yeah.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.069
Come in and sit with me.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.280
Please?

31:12.080 --> 31:14.548
Just for a little while.
Please.

31:15.880 --> 31:16.880
Thank you.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.238
So you're
comfortable enough, right?

31:25.440 --> 31:26.668
It's perfect. Thanks.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.040
Sure.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.872
You wanna know
how it works?

31:44.320 --> 31:47.357
You just dangle a pocket watch in
front of people's faces? Is that it?

31:49.080 --> 31:51.469
You watch a lot of TV.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.511
When I was a kid.
Uh...

31:54.120 --> 31:56.031
Now you're
feeling very sleepy.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.274
We do use focal
points sometimes

32:00.840 --> 32:04.594
to guide someone into a state
of heightened suggestibility.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.398
"Heightened suggestibility."

32:06.560 --> 32:08.437
That's right.
That's right.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.640
Do you smoke in front
of my daughter?

32:18.040 --> 32:19.314
I'm gonna quit.
I promise.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.516
That's my kid.
That is my kid.

32:21.680 --> 32:22.680
You understand?

32:28.120 --> 32:29.269
What about your mother?

32:33.720 --> 32:35.756
What about her?
Wait, are we...

32:36.280 --> 32:37.952
Where were you when she died?

32:45.200 --> 32:46.952
I don't want to
think about that.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.313
Home. Watching TV.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.392
Do you hear the TV?
What do you hear?

33:02.120 --> 33:03.120
Rain.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.759
Rain. It was raining.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Hmm.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.155
You hear the rain?

33:14.160 --> 33:15.160
Mmm-hmm...

33:16.000 --> 33:18.150
You hear it? Find it.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.272
Tell me when you've found it.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.672
Come here, Chris.
Look at me.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.160
I found it.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.193
Where was your mom?

33:52.280 --> 33:54.874
She was coming home
and she wasn't home.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.520
From work?

33:57.680 --> 33:58.680
Hmm.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.320
Hmm.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.677
And what do you do?

34:11.880 --> 34:12.880
Nothing.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.400
Nothing.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.713
I just sat there.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.197
You didn't call anyone?
No.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.280
Why not?

34:26.080 --> 34:27.831
I don't know.

34:29.639 --> 34:32.837
I just thought that if I did,
it would make it real.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.440
Hmm.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.388
You're so scared.

34:45.159 --> 34:46.752
You think it was your fault.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.592
How do you feel now?

34:55.840 --> 34:57.068
I can't move.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.713
You can't move.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.108
Why can't I move?

35:02.920 --> 35:04.319
You're paralyzed.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.831
Just like that day
when you did nothing.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.268
You did nothing.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.040
Now,

35:15.920 --> 35:17.035
sink into the floor.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.111
Wait, wait, wait.
Sink.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.515
Now you're in
the Sunken Place.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.599
'Sup, man?

38:48.200 --> 38:50.350
They're workin' you
good out here, huh?

38:59.000 --> 39:00.991
Nothing I don't want
to be doing.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.155
Yeah.

39:07.240 --> 39:11.392
I didn't get to meet you,
actually, up close. I'm Chris.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.239
I know who you are.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.078
She is lovely, isn't she?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Rose?

39:21.240 --> 39:22.468
Yeah, she is.

39:22.680 --> 39:25.513
One of a kind.
Top of the line.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.150
A real doggone keeper.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.713
Right.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.158
Sorry about last night.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.240
What?

39:40.040 --> 39:41.109
My exercise.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.191
I didn't mean to scare you.

39:45.880 --> 39:48.075
Yeah. Yeah.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.073
And did it work?
Did what work?

39:50.200 --> 39:53.510
You were in Mrs. Armitage's
office for quite some time.

39:55.720 --> 39:56.869
Oh, yeah.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.080
Hmm?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.477
I guess I had too much
of that wine last night.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.160
Can't really remember. Sorry.

40:05.840 --> 40:10.595
Well, I should get back to
work and mind my own business.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.557
I think your mom hypnotized
me last night.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.309
What?

40:37.240 --> 40:38.240
When?

40:38.560 --> 40:42.439
I went out for some air last night,
and I run into her.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.951
And I can barely
remember anything,

40:46.120 --> 40:48.440
but now the thought of a cigarette
makes me wanna throw up.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.320
Oh, my God.

40:53.560 --> 40:56.393
I'm sorry. I can't believe
she did that to you.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.471
And I had some
fucked-up dreams.

40:58.680 --> 40:59.954
What'd you dream?

41:00.120 --> 41:03.795
I was in a hole or something.
And I couldn't move. It was like...

41:03.960 --> 41:05.871
Oh, God. That sounds terrible.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.109
I'm sorry.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.954
Hey, uh, what's Walter's deal?

41:12.760 --> 41:14.113
What do you mean "his deal"?

41:14.480 --> 41:16.869
I just talked to him.
Dude's whole vibe is hostile.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.313
Did he say something?

41:20.880 --> 41:23.189
It's not what he says.
It's how he says it, you know?

41:24.760 --> 41:25.760
Hmm.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.312
Maybe he likes you.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.039
Maybe he's jealous
or something. I don't...

41:35.520 --> 41:36.919
Are you fucking with me?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
No.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.436
So you think I've got
a chance with him?

41:43.840 --> 41:46.434
All right, you got jokes.
Put in a good word?

41:46.600 --> 41:47.999
Great. No, funny.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.515
I'm gonna talk to my dad about that.
That's not...

41:50.680 --> 41:52.320
No, don't talk to your dad.
It's not cool.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.296
It's fine, it's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.356
Forget about it. It's done.

41:56.880 --> 41:57.880
Okay.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Oh, boy.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.193
Oh, man.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.474
It begins.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.312
Are you ready for this?

42:14.480 --> 42:15.708
Yeah, I am.

42:15.840 --> 42:16.840
I'm not.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.791
There they are.
Oh!

42:21.440 --> 42:23.954
So nice.
How are you?

42:24.720 --> 42:26.358
Just smile.
Smile? All right.

42:26.560 --> 42:27.595
How do you do that again?

42:27.680 --> 42:29.432
Yeah, just smile
the whole time.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.278
Yeah, there you go.
There it is.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.556
Oh, look,
it's the Greenes.

42:35.720 --> 42:36.994
Gordon and Emily,
this is Chris.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.718
Chris, this is Gordon
and Emily Greene.

42:38.880 --> 42:39.949
Chris. Nice to meet you.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.395
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Nice to meet you indeed.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.595
Oh, that's quite a grip.

42:43.680 --> 42:44.715
Thank you. You too, man.

42:44.840 --> 42:46.432
You, uh, ever play golf?

42:46.720 --> 42:49.029
Mmm, once, a few years ago.
I wasn't very good.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.514
Gordon was a professional
golfer for years.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.069
Oh, you kiddin'?

42:54.160 --> 42:57.072
Well, I can't quite swing the
hips like I used to, though.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.196
But, uh, I do know Tiger.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.280
Oh.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.031
Oh, that's great.
Super.

43:03.600 --> 43:04.828
Gordon loves Tiger.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.319
Oh, the best I've ever seen.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.192
Ever. Hands down.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.874
So, Chris, uh,
let's see your form.

43:12.600 --> 43:14.192
This is Nelson and Lisa.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.594
Hey, how you doin'?

43:15.760 --> 43:18.479
So, how handsome is he?

43:19.360 --> 43:21.237
I don't know, are you handsome?

43:23.720 --> 43:24.720
Okay.

43:25.120 --> 43:28.590
Oh!
Not bad. Eh, Nelson?

43:31.600 --> 43:33.750
So, is it true?

43:36.120 --> 43:37.120
Is it better?

43:37.200 --> 43:38.200
Oh, wow.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.560
Wow.

43:40.080 --> 43:43.959
Fairer skin has been in favor for the
past, what, couple of hundreds of years?

43:44.520 --> 43:46.715
But now the pendulum
has swung back.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.037
Black is in fashion.

43:53.240 --> 43:55.435
Pardon me, I'm gonna
take some pictures.

43:55.600 --> 43:56.794
Sure thing.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.232
- There he is.
- Oh!

45:00.880 --> 45:03.030
Good to see another
brother around here.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.039
Hi. Yes, of course it is.

45:12.360 --> 45:13.873
Something wrong?

45:14.800 --> 45:15.994
There you are.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.313
Do something with this.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.480
Ah, yes, yes.

45:20.560 --> 45:24.075
Oh, hello. I'm Philomena.
And you are?

45:25.560 --> 45:27.551
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.

45:27.720 --> 45:29.073
Fantastic.

45:29.240 --> 45:31.708
You two make a lovely couple.

45:32.680 --> 45:33.715
Thanks.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.313
Oh, where are my manners?

45:35.480 --> 45:37.710
Logan. Logan King.

45:38.520 --> 45:40.033
Chris was just telling me
how he felt

45:40.120 --> 45:42.076
much more comfortable
with my being here.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.240
That's nice.

45:45.920 --> 45:49.754
Logan, I hate to tear you
away, dear, but

45:49.840 --> 45:51.592
the Wincotts were
asking about you.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.079
Ah, mmm.

45:54.680 --> 45:56.636
Well, it was nice to
meet you, Chris.

46:01.240 --> 46:03.196
Goodbye.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.996
What the fuck?

46:39.960 --> 46:41.029
Ignorance.

46:42.960 --> 46:43.960
Who?

46:44.000 --> 46:45.479
All of 'em.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.910
They mean well but they have no
idea what real people go through.

46:51.880 --> 46:53.677
Jim Hudson.
Chris.

46:53.800 --> 46:54.835
I know who you are.

46:56.080 --> 46:59.755
I am an admirer of your work.
You have a great eye.

46:59.960 --> 47:03.748
Wait, Jim Hudson?
Hudson Galleries?

47:04.720 --> 47:08.838
Believe me, the irony of being a
blind art dealer isn't lost on me.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.831
How'd you do it?

47:12.400 --> 47:16.678
My assistant describes the
work to me in great detail.

47:17.680 --> 47:18.999
You've got something.

47:19.160 --> 47:23.233
The images you capture.
So brutal, so melancholic.

47:24.480 --> 47:26.630
It's powerful stuff, I think.

47:27.520 --> 47:28.794
Thank you.
Hmm.

47:29.440 --> 47:33.274
Used to dabble myself,
wilderness mostly.

47:34.280 --> 47:39.400
I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before
realizing I didn't have the eye.

47:39.600 --> 47:43.195
I began dealing.
Then, of course, my vision went to shit.

47:43.520 --> 47:44.520
Damn.

47:45.520 --> 47:48.671
I know. Life can be
a sick joke.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.835
One day, you're developing
prints in the darkroom.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.514
The next day,
you wake up in the dark.

47:55.720 --> 47:57.312
Genetic disease.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.153
Shit ain't fair, man.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.959
Oh, you got that right.
Shit ain't fair.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.400
Hey.

49:01.560 --> 49:02.754
Come here, come here.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.755
What the fuck?
You left me out there.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.757
Look at this.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.509
She unplugged my phone.

49:12.640 --> 49:13.640
Who?

49:13.760 --> 49:16.752
Georgina. I came here to talk
to Rod, and I got no juice.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.956
So you think she
did that because...

49:19.360 --> 49:21.874
Maybe she doesn't like

49:23.800 --> 49:25.597
the fact that I'm with you.

49:29.040 --> 49:30.314
Really?

49:31.320 --> 49:32.320
It's a thing.

49:32.400 --> 49:36.359
So you are so sexy that people
are just unpluggin' your phone?

49:38.720 --> 49:39.720
Forget it. Never mind.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.791
No, no, no. Stop, don't...

49:43.000 --> 49:44.638
Don't do that.
Don't...

49:44.800 --> 49:47.234
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's all good, all right?

50:01.320 --> 50:03.072
They got you on
display now, huh?

50:03.240 --> 50:05.549
It's weird, man.
And it's the people here, too.

50:05.640 --> 50:08.216
It's like they haven't met a black
person that doesn't work for 'em.

50:08.240 --> 50:09.673
Yep, you're in it.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.114
Also, shit...

50:11.680 --> 50:13.159
I don't even wanna tell you.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.360
What?

50:15.840 --> 50:17.512
I got hypnotized last night.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.353
Nigga, get the fuck
outta here.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.831
No. Yo, yo.
Yeah, to quit smoking.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.355
But it's Rose's mom's
a psychiatrist, so...

50:24.520 --> 50:27.193
Bruh, I don't care if the bitch
is Iyanla Vanzant, okay?

50:27.360 --> 50:30.113
She can't fix my motherfuckin' life.
You ain't gettin' in my head.

50:30.520 --> 50:32.192
I know. She caught me
off guard, right?

50:32.360 --> 50:37.229
But it's cool because
I'm cured. It worked.

50:37.400 --> 50:39.550
Bruh, how are you
not scared of this, man?

50:39.760 --> 50:41.856
Look, they could've made you
do all types of stupid shit.

50:41.880 --> 50:44.155
They'd have you fuckin'
barking like a dog,

50:44.560 --> 50:46.240
flying around
like you're a fuckin' pigeon,

50:46.360 --> 50:47.360
lookin' ridiculous, okay?

50:47.560 --> 50:49.835
Or, I don't know
if you know this,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.040
white people love makin'
people sex slaves and shit.

50:53.240 --> 50:55.595
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're
not a kinky sex family, dawg.

50:55.760 --> 50:59.275
Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating the
shit outta niggas' heads. Okay?

50:59.440 --> 51:01.317
But that was after
he fucked the heads.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.118
Do you think they
saw that shit comin'?

51:03.280 --> 51:04.429
Hell no.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.352
Okay? They was comin'
over there like,

51:06.520 --> 51:09.239
"I'mma just suck a little dick,
maybe jiggle some balls and shit."

51:09.400 --> 51:11.231
No. They didn't get
a chance to jiggle shit

51:11.400 --> 51:13.200
because their head
was off their fuckin' body.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.216
Yeah, they still sucked a dick,
but without their heads.

51:15.240 --> 51:17.037
It was fuckin' weird,
detached head shit.

51:17.120 --> 51:18.800
You know, that's
Jeffrey Dahmer's business.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.696
And thanks for that
image right there, man.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.995
Hey, man, I ain't makin' this shit up.
I saw on A&E, man.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.080
It's real life.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.376
Yo, and it's the black people
out here, too.

51:26.400 --> 51:28.277
It's like all of them
missed the movement.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.277
'Cause they
probably hypnotized.

51:32.760 --> 51:35.115
Look, bruh, all I'm doin'
is connecting the dots.

51:35.320 --> 51:37.436
I'm taking what you
presented to me, okay?

51:37.600 --> 51:39.511
I'mma tell you this.
I think that mom

51:39.600 --> 51:40.856
is puttin' everybody
in a trance,

51:40.880 --> 51:42.360
and she's fuckin'
the shit out of 'em.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.628
Thanks, Rod, bye.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.598
Hello.
Fuck. Hi.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.955
I owe you an apology.

51:53.720 --> 51:56.553
How rude of me to have touched
your belongings without asking.

51:57.640 --> 51:58.755
Oh...

51:58.840 --> 52:01.274
No, it's cool.
I was just confused.

52:01.440 --> 52:05.911
Well, I can assure you,
there was no funny business.

52:06.480 --> 52:08.630
Allow me to explain.

52:08.800 --> 52:12.918
I lifted your cellular phone
to wipe down the dresser,

52:13.480 --> 52:15.789
and it accidentally
came undone.

52:15.960 --> 52:18.269
Yeah, I told... Rather than
meddle with it further,

52:18.680 --> 52:20.352
I left it that way.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.998
How foolish of me.

52:24.840 --> 52:28.310
It's fine.
I wasn't trying to snitch.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.040
Snitch?

52:31.960 --> 52:33.154
Rat you out.

52:35.480 --> 52:36.754
Tattletale.

52:38.120 --> 52:39.120
Yeah.

52:40.480 --> 52:42.471
Oh, don't you
worry about that.

52:43.720 --> 52:45.358
I can assure you,

52:46.640 --> 52:48.995
I don't answer to anyone.

52:49.920 --> 52:50.989
Right.

52:51.680 --> 52:53.557
All I know is sometimes

52:54.720 --> 52:57.109
if there's too many white people,
I get nervous, you know?

53:23.240 --> 53:25.435
Oh. Oh!

53:25.520 --> 53:29.195
No. No. No.

53:29.920 --> 53:33.390
No, no, no, no.

53:34.560 --> 53:36.312
Aren't you something?

53:37.560 --> 53:39.152
That's not my experience.

53:39.720 --> 53:41.278
Not at all.

53:43.400 --> 53:47.313
The Armitages are
so good to us.

53:49.240 --> 53:51.071
They treat us like family.

54:07.440 --> 54:08.919
This bitch is crazy.

54:10.640 --> 54:12.073
The bitch is crazy.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.433
Oh, hey, hang on. Chris.

54:20.920 --> 54:22.751
Chris, I wanna introduce you
to some friends.

54:23.080 --> 54:25.355
This is David
and Marcia Wincott,

54:25.440 --> 54:27.192
Ronald and Celia Jeffries,

54:27.280 --> 54:28.474
Hiroki Tanaka,

54:28.560 --> 54:30.596
and Jessika and
Fredrich Walden.

54:33.680 --> 54:35.750
Too many names
to remember, but hi.

54:36.840 --> 54:39.479
Do you find that
being African-American

54:40.120 --> 54:45.274
has more advantage or
disadvantage in the modern world?

54:45.560 --> 54:46.560
Whoa!

54:48.520 --> 54:49.953
It's a tough one.

54:52.840 --> 54:54.956
Yeah, um, I don't know, man.

54:56.640 --> 54:57.709
Hey.

54:58.280 --> 54:59.872
Yo, my man.

55:00.040 --> 55:02.096
They were askin' me about the
African-American experience.

55:02.120 --> 55:03.473
Maybe you could take this one.

55:04.440 --> 55:05.440
Oh.

55:06.320 --> 55:09.949
Well, well, I find that the
African-American experience

55:10.160 --> 55:13.470
for me has been,
for the most part, very good.

55:13.640 --> 55:16.632
Although I find it difficult
to go into detail

55:16.800 --> 55:20.918
as I haven't had much of a desire
to leave the house in a while.

55:21.560 --> 55:22.993
We've become such homebodies.

55:23.160 --> 55:24.673
Yes, yes.

55:24.800 --> 55:28.031
But even when you go into the city,
I've just had no interest.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.756
The chores have become
my sanctuary.

55:34.720 --> 55:36.676
Fucking shit.

55:47.040 --> 55:48.040
Get out.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.672
Sorry, man.
Logan.

55:51.760 --> 55:53.557
Get out!
Yo!

55:54.360 --> 55:56.078
Yo, chill, man.
Get out!

55:56.240 --> 55:58.336
Get outta here! Get outta here!
Chill! Chill, man! Chill!

55:58.360 --> 55:59.952
Get the fuck outta here!
Chill!

56:08.400 --> 56:11.472
Seizures create anxiety
which can trigger aggression.

56:11.680 --> 56:14.148
Yeah, but randomly
attacking other people?

56:14.320 --> 56:15.753
It's not random.

56:15.920 --> 56:19.071
You know, it was your flash.
That's what set him off.

56:20.280 --> 56:21.349
Hey.
Well...

56:21.560 --> 56:23.630
How's he doing?
He's much better.

56:27.040 --> 56:30.919
I imagine that I owe
you all an apology.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.433
No, no, no.

56:32.600 --> 56:35.239
We're just very happy
that you're yourself again.

56:35.400 --> 56:36.913
Yes. Yes, I am.
Hmm.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.833
And I thank God
for you for calming me down.

56:41.720 --> 56:44.553
I know that I must've
frightened you all quite a bit.

56:45.080 --> 56:46.308
Especially you, Chris.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.152
No. I'm sorry.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.235
The flash. I didn't know.

56:52.080 --> 56:54.230
Of course not.
How could you have?

56:54.400 --> 56:56.595
And you shouldn't
have been drinking, either.

56:56.960 --> 56:58.154
Yes.

56:59.640 --> 57:01.080
Well, I'll have to
let you all get on

57:01.120 --> 57:03.429
the rest of the night without
the aid of my marvelous wit.

57:04.840 --> 57:08.071
The whole ordeal has made me
quite a bit exhausted.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.435
Logan, you just
get some rest.

57:13.440 --> 57:15.431
It was nice
meeting you, Chris.

57:16.680 --> 57:17.749
Yeah.

57:19.320 --> 57:21.515
Something to lighten the mood?

57:21.680 --> 57:24.956
Yes! Yeah, let's get this
party back on track.

57:25.120 --> 57:27.953
How about sparklers
and Bingo?

57:31.000 --> 57:32.592
We're gonna go on a walk.

57:33.120 --> 57:34.269
You sure?

57:37.240 --> 57:38.240
Shall we?

57:40.040 --> 57:41.234
My cousin's epileptic.

57:41.320 --> 57:42.878
That wasn't a seizure, right?

57:44.720 --> 57:46.278
My dad's a neurosurgeon.

57:46.480 --> 57:48.616
And that's what he said it was.
I'm inclined to trust...

57:48.640 --> 57:50.790
That wasn't a seizure.
What was it then?

57:50.960 --> 57:52.313
How long have you
known that guy?

57:53.400 --> 57:55.118
I met him today. Why?

57:59.040 --> 58:00.996
Man, this is gonna
sound weird,

58:02.680 --> 58:04.557
but when he came at me,

58:05.680 --> 58:07.352
it felt like I knew him.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.991
Like you've met Logan before?

58:12.160 --> 58:14.320
No, I don't know Logan.
I knew the guy that come at me.

58:23.880 --> 58:28.158
I think your mom got in my head, all right?
I think she got in my head.

58:28.320 --> 58:29.912
Yeah, and it worked,
I thought...

58:30.000 --> 58:33.072
No, it did not.
It didn't work.

58:33.160 --> 58:34.275
She got in my head,

58:34.360 --> 58:37.440
and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up
shit that I don't want to think about.

58:39.040 --> 58:40.678
Like what?

58:54.240 --> 58:55.355
I just need to go.

59:03.560 --> 59:04.879
You wanna go?
Mmm-hmm.

59:07.200 --> 59:08.315
Without me?

59:09.720 --> 59:10.720
Whatever you want.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.713
I told you about that
night my mom died.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.952
When I didn't call 911,
didn't go out looking for her.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.560
Yeah.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.632
One hour went by,
then two, then three,

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.392
and I just sat there.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.630
I was just watching TV.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.473
There's nothing
you could've done.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.235
I found out later
that, uh,

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.629
she had survived
the initial hit.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.950
She laid there bleeding
by the side of the road,

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.997
cold and alone.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.317
That's how she died in the
early morning, cold and alone.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.152
And I was watching TV.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.436
There was time. There was time.
You were just a little kid.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.833
There was time.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.096
There was time, if somebody
was looking for her.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.192
There was time, but nobody,
nobody was looking.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.152
You're all I got.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.710
I'm not gonna leave here without you.
I'm not gonna abandon you, okay?

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.112
You're not?

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.998
No, no, I'm not.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.712
Oh, my God.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.358
You scared me.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.958
Let's go home.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.519
What?

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.592
Let's go home. This sucks.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.833
This sucks. Let's go home.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.433
I'll make something up.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.272
I love you.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.912
I love you too, baby.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.640
Good night.
Thank you.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.074
Come on, sweetie.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.514
Good night, Chris!
It was great to meet you.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.348
Asshole.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160
Yo!

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.594
That's Dre.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.795
Dre?

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.599
Andre Hayworth. He used
to kick it with Veronica.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.680
Veronica from what?

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.274
Teresa's sister, that worked at
the movie theater on Eighth!

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.228
Yes, that is him!
That is him! But wait...

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.198
This is so fucking crazy!

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.191
Yo, he's different.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.669
No shit. Why's he
dressed like that?

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.677
It's not that,
it's everything.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.474
He came to the party with a white
woman 30 years older than him.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.871
Sex slave! Oh, shit!

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.816
Chris, you gotta get the
fuck up outta there, man!

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.638
You in some Eyes Wide Shut situation.
Leave, motherfucker.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.880
Hello?

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.469
You gonna be a...
Hello? Chris?

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.359
Oh, shit. His battery
must've fuckin' died.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.992
Hey, handsome.
Are you packing?

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.275
Rose, we gotta go.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.634
We gotta go now.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.834
Okay.
Okay.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.149
Is everything okay?

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.470
I'll tell you in the car.
But we gotta go right now.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.158
Is that okay?
Okay, yeah.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.551
Uh, let me go get my bag.
Okay.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200
Okay.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960
Shit.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.309
Hey, you ready?

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.073
Yeah, I'm just looking
for my camera.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160
Uh...

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.440
It's right here.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.016
Have you got the keys? I'm gonna put
the bags in the trunk real quick.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.040
Okay.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.192
Uh, yeah.
They are in here somewhere.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.157
It's just a matter of finding them.
Yeah.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.240
You okay?

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.919
Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.115
Okay.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.839
Might take me a second.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.238
Hey, uh...

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.599
What, you can't
find those keys?

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.200
No. I can never find them.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.355
Let's do this on the move.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800
Yeah.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.396
Chris?
Just get the keys.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.272
Yo.
Yo, man.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.400
Where you going?
The party was just getting started.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.112
Just putting the bags
in the car, man.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.872
Would anyone like tea?

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.440
Nah, I'm good.
We leavin', actually.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.875
Really? Why?
Is something wrong?

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.629
Rose?
His dog got really sick.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.234
So he has to be at the vet
first thing in the morning.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.880
Sick.
Yeah.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.473
Oh, how terrible.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.711
- Rose, the keys.
- Looking.

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.440
Rose?

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.069
What is your
purpose, Chris?

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.720
What?

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.078
In life, what is your purpose?

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.280
Right now,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.752
it's finding those keys.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.279
Fire.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.274
It's a reflection
of our own mortality.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:25.352
We're born, we breathe,
and we die.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:26.439
Rose?

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:29.279
I'm looking.

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:33.438
Even the sun will die someday.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:35.957
But we are divine.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.795
We are the gods
trapped in cocoons.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.313
Rose...

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:44.712
I don't know where they are.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880
Rose?

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:48.788
Rose!
Rose, give me those keys!

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.118
Rose, give me...

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.112
Give me those keys.
Rose, now! Now, the keys!

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.314
Be careful, bro.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:58.629
What the fuck?

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:00.792
I didn't do anything.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.394
What the fuck
is going on?

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.639
Where are those keys, Rose?

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.760
You know I can't give you
the keys, right, babe?

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.555
Come on.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.837
Oh, shit.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.514
Is he hurt?
Did you see him drop?

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.194
Yes, I did.
Jeremy, grab his legs, please.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.078
Take him downstairs.
Dean, help him.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.514
I can get him alone.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.874
No, you can't.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.176
You've already
damaged him enough.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.519
Okay, fine.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800
Okay.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.273
Ready?
Mind his head. Please.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.549
Easy.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.840
You're gonna drop him.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.949
No, I'm not.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.000
You're not gonna give me
a little credit?

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.874
Okay, that was my fault.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.632
You were
one of my favorites.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.631
You hear that, Chris?
Huh?

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.438
You're one of her favorites. Chris?

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.616
Hey, it's Chris.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.916
I'm either away from the phone or I
just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.240
Chris!

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:25.976
Hey, it's Chris.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.117
I'm either away from the phone or I
just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.955
Yeah.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:36.960
Me too.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.280
...College Fund.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.113
A mind is a terrible
thing to waste.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.636
Millions of Americans
feel the effects of aging.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.833
Oh, shit.

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.233
Oh, shit!

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.752
Is there anything
more beautiful than a sunrise?

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.750
Hi. I'm Roman Armitage.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.118
And if you're watching this, you're
probably wondering what's going on.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.396
There's no need to worry.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.118
Let's take a walk.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.716
You have been chosen because
of the physical advantages

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.388
you've enjoyed
your entire lifetime.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.916
With your natural gifts
and our determination,

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.833
we could both be
part of something greater.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.911
Something perfect.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.837
The Coagula procedure
is a man-made miracle.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.953
Our order has been developing
it for many, many years,

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.351
and it wasn't until
recently it was perfected

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.313
by my own flesh and blood.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:48.793
My family and I are honored to offer it
as a service to members of our group.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.468
Don't waste your strength,
don't try to fight it.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.633
You can't stop the inevitable.
And who knows?

01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:02.436
Maybe one day, you'll enjoy
being members of the family.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.312
Behold,

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.559
the Coagula.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.193
What the fuck?

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.952
Hello, Mr...

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.470
Uh, Williams. Rod Williams.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.955
From the TSA?

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.189
Yes, ma'am.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.357
You know all TSA issues should be brought
up with your authorizing officer.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.510
Yes, ma'am, but this
is not TSA business.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:58.036
Okay, don't call me "ma'am."
Otherwise we're not gonna get along.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.160
How can I help you,
Rod Williams from the TSA?

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.798
All right, here it is.
Mmm.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.396
My boy, Chris, has been
missing for two days.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.309
Your son is missing?

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.154
Oh, no. Not my son,
my friend. He's 26.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.231
His name is Chris Washington.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.036
He left on Friday with
his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.080
She's white.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.955
All right. Go on.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.280
Look, Chris was supposed
to come back on Sunday, right?

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.908
And I've been watching his dog, Sid.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040
That's Sid.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.473
Cute, right?

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.590
So Chris sent this to me from his
girlfriend's parents' house.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.638
See, that's Andre Hayworth.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.756
Okay? Somebody we knew
from back in the day.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.310
Apparently, he's been missing for
six months in some affluent suburb.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.351
Well, he don't look
so missing to me.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.510
That's 'cause we
found him, right?

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.240
But Chris said
he's acting real different.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.709
Different how?

01:16:58.840 --> 01:16:59.920
This dude is from Brooklyn.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.078
Huh? He didn't dress
like this.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.112
I didn't use to
dress like this.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.755
Plus he's married to a
white woman twice his age.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.156
And that would explain
the clothes. All right.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.078
Oh, Lord! Rod Williams
from the TSA.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.160
I know, I know, I know.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.117
Okay, I'm trying to
work towards this.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.990
Look, what I'm about to
tell you gonna sound crazy.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.959
You ready?
All right.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.155
Try me.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.313
I believe they've been
abducting black people,

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:31.109
brainwashing 'em, making 'em work
for 'em as sex slaves and shit.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.720
Oh, sorry about the "shit."

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.520
Sorry.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.480
Hold on a second.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.296
Then he sent me some
weird picture and I'm like,

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.753
"Oh, man,
that's Andre Hayworth."

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.296
This dude been missing
for six months, right?

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.640
So I do all my research,
you know, 'cause as a TSA agent...

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.075
You guys are detectives?
I got the same training, you know?

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.752
We might know more
than y'all sometimes.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.816
'Cause we dealin' with
some terrorist shit, so...

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.136
But that's a
totally different story.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.754
So, look, I go do
my detective work, right?

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.876
And I start putting
pieces together.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.440
And, see, this is
what I came up with.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:08.116
They're probably abducting black people,
brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.750
Or sex slaves. Not just regular slaves,
but sex slaves and shit.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.040
See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis
that's making 'em slaves or whatnot,

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.711
but all I know is they already
got two brothers we know,

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.400
and there could be a whole bunch
of brothers they got already.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.360
What's the next move?

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.956
And don't ever, ever say that
I don't do nothin' for you.

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.312
Oh! White girls.
Oh, they get you every time.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.400
Oh!

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.360
Magic ain't real.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.031
None of this shit makes sense.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.600
Hello?

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.640
Chris?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.069
Yo, um...

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:21.153
Hey, what up?
Rose, it's me, Rod.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.360
Hi.

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.955
Where's Chris?

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.675
He left two days ago.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.909
He left?

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.399
Yeah. He got all paranoid,
and then he freaked out on me.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.951
And then he just got
in a cab and left his phone.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.909
Wait. You haven't seen him?

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.832
No, he never came back here.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.838
Oh, my God.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.791
Look, look, I've been calling
his phone a bunch of times.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.393
Matter of fact,
I went to the police.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.039
What did you say?

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.799
I just said he was missing.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.075
Oh, good. Uh...

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.074
Let me ask you somethin'.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:05.029
What cab company
did he, uh, use to leave?

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.314
Oh, gosh.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.676
I don't know. I guess
maybe a local one.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.558
Or I guess he could've
called an Uber?

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.634
Um, wait. I'm so confused.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.717
Oh, you confused? Okay.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.079
You know somethin'? Me too.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.719
Could you hold on one second?
Okay.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.114
Okay. Hold on.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:31.158
You lyin' bitch. She is lyin' like
a motherfucker. I know that...

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.671
Ooh, that TSA shit tingles.
This motherfucker's lying.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.510
Okay, I got you.
I'm gonna record your ass.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.918
I'mma record
the shit outta you.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.673
You talk too goddamn much.
You're gonna say somethin'.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.432
Hold on. Record.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.749
Speaker.

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.589
Unmute.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.360
Uh, Rose?

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.033
Uh-huh?
Um...

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.037
So last time I talked to Chris,
he told me your mama hypnotized him.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.272
Rod, just stop.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Huh?

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.679
I know why you're calling.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.355
Why is that?

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.910
It's kind of obvious,
don't you think?

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.880
What?

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.917
That there's something
between us.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.720
No. What you talkin' about, girl?
I called you about Chris.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.516
No, Rod, whenever we'd go out,
I remember you looking at me.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.750
What the fuck you...
No! Chris is my best friend.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.096
Look, if you did
somethin' to him...

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.509
I know you think about
fucking me, Rod.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.216
Ain't nobody thought about fucking you.
Why would you say some stupid shit?

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.834
What the... You ass! Fuck you!
I didn't wanna...

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.319
Fuck you! Bye!

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.429
Shit!

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.074
God! She's so...
She's a fuckin'... She's a...

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:44.400
She's a genius.

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.273
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.749
Hey, Chris.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.593
How's it going, buddy?

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.073
You can answer.
There's an intercom in the room.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.512
Where's Rose?

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.278
Oh, you dirty dog.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.554
You're one of the lucky ones,
trust me.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.315
Jeremy's wrangling method
sounds way less pleasant.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.070
I'm supposed to answer
any outstanding questions,

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.708
concerns you may have so far.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.998
Apparently, our common
understanding of the process

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:00.157
has a positive impact on the
success rate of the procedure.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.875
You could give a shit,
right? Okay.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.914
Let me just tell you
what it is.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:14.355
Phase one was the hypnotism.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.271
That's how they sedate you.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.396
Phase two is this.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:22.189
Mental preparation.
It's basically psychological pre-op.

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.709
Pre-op?

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.353
For phase three.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.637
The transplantation.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.317
Well, partial, actually.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.598
The piece of your brain connected
to your nervous system

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:44.356
needs to stay put, keeping those
intricate connections intact.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.958
So you won't be gone,
not completely.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:52.238
A sliver of you will still be in there,
somewhere, limited consciousness.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.275
You'll be able to see and hear

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.274
what your body is doing,

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.590
but your existence
will be as a passenger.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.875
An audience. You'll live in...

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.712
The Sunken Place.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.236
Now you're in the Sunken Place.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.394
Yeah. That's what
she calls it.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:30.070
Now, I'll control the motor
functions, so I'll be...

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.160
Me.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.599
You'll be me.

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:37.392
Good, good.

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.070
You got it quick. Good on you.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.233
Why us, huh?

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.832
Why black people?

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.593
Who knows?

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:56.717
People want a change.
Some people wanna be stronger,

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.753
faster, cooler.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.751
Black is in fashion.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.752
But please don't lump me in with that.
I could give a shit what color you are.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:11.152
No. What I want is deeper.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.635
I want your eye, man.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.239
I want those things
you see through.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.158
This is crazy.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.108
Okay, I'm done.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.832
No, no, no, no.

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.718
Jeremy?

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.309
You fuck!

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
You fuck.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.635
Fuck you!

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.470
Come on! Come on!

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:46.149
One Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:50.111
Three Mississippi.
Four Mississippi.

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.376
911. What's your emergency?

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.278
I'm at the Armitage house.
My name is Chris.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.118
I'm sorry, sir,
can you repeat that?

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.560
I'm at the Armitage...

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.830
No, no, no.
Don't do it, don't do it.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.230
Don't do it. Just fuckin' go.

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.354
Grandma.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.150
You ruined my house!

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.553
Get him, Grandpa.

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.594
Damn you!

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.519
Let me do it.

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.870
Chris, I'm so sorry.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:12.828
It's me.

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.639
And I love you.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.319
I love you.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.319
I love you.

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:12.395
Help. Help.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.756
Help. Help me.

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:23.995
Oh, shit!

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:29.920
Chris!

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:09.479
I mean, I told you
not to go in that house.

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:15.799
I mean...

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.032
How'd you find me?

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.997
I'm T-S-motherfuckin'-A.

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.798
We handle shit.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.078
That's what we do.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.070
Consider this situation
fuckin' handled.
