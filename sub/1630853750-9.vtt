WEBVTT

00:10.719 --> 00:13.138
The sheriff and highway patrol are aware.

00:14.597 --> 00:18.018
Okay. Thank you, Bert.
Just can you keep me posted, please?

00:19.352 --> 00:21.062
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.318
-Hi.
-Hey. Any word yet?

00:27.402 --> 00:28.319
No, no.

00:30.613 --> 00:31.531
So who's doing what?

00:31.614 --> 00:34.325
Preacher is driving through town, looking.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.285
Um...

00:35.785 --> 00:38.163
Brie and Brady are walking the riverbank

00:38.246 --> 00:40.832
and Mike is trying
to track Jack's cell phone.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.501
When I left the B and B,
Jo Ellen was still manning the phone tree.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.879
Bert and his mechanic are out looking.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.131
Good. So, what can I do?

00:49.424 --> 00:53.344
-You sure you wanna stay?
-I won't let you handle this by yourself.

00:53.970 --> 00:57.015
Well, the hospital said I could call back,

00:57.098 --> 01:00.018
-if you could call them.
-I'll call. Grace Valley?

01:00.101 --> 01:01.102
-Okay.
-Thank you.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.860
-Jack?
-<i>Mel, it's Stacie.</i>

01:08.943 --> 01:10.445
<i>Did you get my message?</i>

01:10.528 --> 01:11.738
Stacie, hi.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.448
Hey, so I'm in Clear River.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.159
I was hoping
we could have dinner tomorrow.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.787
Listen. I'm dealing with an emergency,

01:18.870 --> 01:21.831
-<i>so I can't talk. I--</i>
-I really need to see you.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.544
I'm getting another call.
Just call me tomorrow. Oh, God.

01:27.962 --> 01:28.838
Hello?

01:28.922 --> 01:31.549
<i>No John Does</i>
<i>in the last 12 hours, Dr. Hayek.</i>

01:31.633 --> 01:32.467
All right.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.638
Could you transfer me
to the morgue, please?

01:51.569 --> 01:53.446
Mel, just hang in there.

01:54.572 --> 01:57.826
We will find him. Yeah.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.078
What did Mel say?

02:00.161 --> 02:02.122
No sign of him yet.

02:02.205 --> 02:05.375
I can't just sit around here.
I'll drive around--

02:05.458 --> 02:08.336
You shouldn't be driving
with your macular thing.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.546
Fine, fine.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.715
-I'll call Denny.
-He's at the movies.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.845
-His phone's off.
-See?

02:16.928 --> 02:17.804
I'll go.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.181
A, you are not cleared to drive,

02:20.265 --> 02:22.684
and, B, you just said you had a headache.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.269
I'll take more aspirin.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.730
Let me repeat,
you are not cleared to drive.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.899
We're getting to be like your truck.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.361
Something breaks,
they no longer make replacement parts.

02:33.444 --> 02:36.072
-It is called aging.
-God.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.491
I wish Lilly was here.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.285
She'd be over in a flash.

02:40.368 --> 02:44.247
Muriel. Sorry to call so late,
but do you think you could drive--?

02:45.290 --> 02:47.876
That would be great. Yes.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.421
-She's on her way.
-And then what?

02:51.504 --> 02:54.299
Well, we grid the county map

02:55.216 --> 02:58.887
and then we drive one section at a time.

03:00.054 --> 03:04.100
Pull up a photo of Jack
in case we need to show it to some people.

03:04.184 --> 03:08.229
-Vernon, we have to find him.
-We will leave no stone unturned.

03:16.863 --> 03:17.697
Hey.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.282
Hey, Preach.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.701
You found anything yet?

03:21.784 --> 03:23.870
No. Sorry.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.665
What if he had an accident
and he's trapped?

03:27.749 --> 03:30.501
We've got all hands on deck.
We'll find him.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.962
It's been six hours
since anybody has heard from him.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.714
We've got to stay positive.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.550
I know. I'm trying.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.678
Actually, hold on.
I think I see something.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.544
-What the hell, Jack?
-What are you doing here?

04:13.628 --> 04:15.797
-Looking for you.
-What?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.342
-<i>I got him, Mel.</i>
-My God. Thank God.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.517
Oh, shit. I need to get to the wedding.

04:28.017 --> 04:28.935
It's over, man.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.104
-Huh?
-It's over.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.239
Good night.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.842
You're spending the night
at Preacher's house.

05:00.925 --> 05:01.926
I had to see you.

05:04.887 --> 05:10.018
Mel, I'm so sorry I missed the wedding.
I know how important that was to you.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.188
Oh. Okay, okay.
Right, so that's what you're sorry about.

05:17.525 --> 05:21.988
-I thought something happened to you.
-No, I'm fine.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.241
Oh, yeah.
Well, clearly that's not the case.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.159
Look. I, um...

05:26.993 --> 05:30.830
Something came up
and I didn't handle it well.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.082
Great, so you decided to drink.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.209
I thought I could sleep it off.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.545
I don't even know what to say to that.

05:39.672 --> 05:43.092
You know,
I had the entire town looking for you.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.763
I'll apologize to everyone, but right now
I wanna make things right with you.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.600
Mel, look, I know I messed up.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.893
Okay? I'm sorry.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.355
Just go.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.151
Do you want me to make coffee?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.152
Mm-mm.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.321
Not yet.

06:50.243 --> 06:54.705
-You're something else, you know that?
-The feeling's mutual.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.836
And thanks again for last night.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.133
I know going to a wedding and then
helping me look for Jack wasn't fun.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.175
It was fine.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.012
And at least he's okay, you know?

07:10.847 --> 07:12.682
I just don't understand.

07:13.474 --> 07:16.477
-He's always been so responsible.
-That's the problem.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.938
He acts like he's untouchable, but...

07:20.606 --> 07:21.941
the stuff he's seen...

07:23.943 --> 07:24.777
it's dark.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.155
It doesn't magically disappear

07:27.238 --> 07:29.740
just because you pretend
you got everything figured out.

07:30.575 --> 07:34.370
Well, how did you handle it
when you got back?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.288
Not well.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.832
I got in fights, went to jail.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.419
I didn't do it the right way, but...

07:42.420 --> 07:44.255
I did let go of a lot of stuff.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.677
Jack is hurting.
I don't know how to help him.

07:50.970 --> 07:51.929
Just be there.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.934
When I got back,
I didn't have anyone I could talk to.

07:57.018 --> 08:01.564
My uncle had his own problems.
And I think if I had someone I felt...

08:03.399 --> 08:05.693
close to, it would have really helped.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.446
And how do you feel now?

08:11.365 --> 08:12.825
Now I feel happy.

08:15.495 --> 08:19.123
I know it won't last,
but right now, everything's good.

08:19.207 --> 08:23.085
-What do you mean, it won't last?
-This is you taking a break.

08:24.086 --> 08:28.299
Yeah, at some point,
you'll wanna go back to the city,

08:28.382 --> 08:31.552
your big corporate legal job

08:31.636 --> 08:34.847
with your fundraisers
and your opera tickets.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.808
It just ain't my world.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.269
-I hate opera.
-You know what I mean.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.775
Brady. This isn't some vacation fling.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.320
I'm in love with you.

08:53.658 --> 08:57.870
Right now, that's true.
And that's enough for me.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.558
All right,
well, in case I haven't said it already,

09:19.183 --> 09:22.478
thanks for bringing me back to my truck,
for putting me up last night.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.021
My couch is your couch.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.649
You talk to Mel?

09:29.277 --> 09:31.779
-She's not picking up her phone.
-What are you gonna do?

09:31.862 --> 09:33.531
Go to the clinic, apologize.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.408
Hope she's calmed down.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.537
-I don't blame her for being mad at you.
-Neither do I.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.415
Hey, listen, man.

09:43.207 --> 09:48.713
I want you to know that I think of you
as family, so I'll be straight with you.

09:48.796 --> 09:52.008
Work out your issues,
find out what's going on up here.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.178
Hmm.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.265
Talk to Barry Martinez, he's a therapist.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.476
Tell me, how is a civilian gonna
understand what I'm dealing with?

10:02.560 --> 10:04.020
He did two tours in the Marines.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.565
He's got a master's in psychology
and he runs my veterans support group.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.943
I told you, I'm not gonna be
sitting around in a circle

10:11.027 --> 10:13.237
with a group of guys
talking about my feelings.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.324
He does one-on-ones. I've been doing them
since Christopher disappeared.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.950
Without Barry, I would've lost it.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.286
Glad therapy works,
but don't think it's my thing.

10:20.369 --> 10:23.247
Whatever it is you're doing,
it ain't working.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.875
At least give it a try, man.

10:45.269 --> 10:48.648
-What is that?
-Blueberry muffins for Muriel.

10:48.731 --> 10:52.234
As a thank-you for last night.
Can you drop them off on your way to work?

10:52.318 --> 10:55.863
Well, sure, sure. That was--
That was very thoughtful of you.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.032
She was a good sport last night.

10:58.115 --> 11:01.369
For putting up
with your backseat driving, she sure was.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.413
Jack is safe,
and that's all that needs to be said.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.623
Mm-hm.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.542
Have you seen Denny?

11:08.626 --> 11:11.003
Yeah, he left a note,
said he's running errands.

11:11.087 --> 11:11.921
Oh.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.631
So...

11:15.424 --> 11:16.759
what are you doing today?

11:18.928 --> 11:19.762
I don't know.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.348
I can't stop thinking about Lilly.

11:24.183 --> 11:28.187
Last night made me realize how much
I depended on her in emergencies.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.107
Muriel is not exactly a calming influence.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.316
Mm. Mm.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.530
Why don't you give Tara a call?

11:37.613 --> 11:41.367
Maybe seeing her
would help you feel closer to Lilly.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.247
Maybe, or it'll make me miss her more.

11:46.330 --> 11:50.042
What if seeing you makes Tara feel better?

11:51.335 --> 11:52.962
That'd be pretty good, wouldn't it?

12:04.306 --> 12:06.600
Hey. Mel here?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.978
-She's in with a patient.
-I'll wait.

12:10.187 --> 12:13.441
-You want some coffee?
-Sure.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.446
-How do you take it? Black?
-Yeah, thanks.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.243
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.586
So any idea how long she's gonna be?

12:33.669 --> 12:36.922
It's hard to say.
She's been out of sorts this morning.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.342
-Yeah.
-Yeah, she's tired, distracted.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.473
-Last night was hard on her.
-Right.

12:45.556 --> 12:49.935
I know this is none of my business,
but it's obvious how much she loves you.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.437
It is none of your business.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.814
I'm just trying to help.
Mel's a great woman and...

12:54.565 --> 12:57.526
Look, I don't know what you're hoping
to get out of the situation.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.528
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.157
I'm not hoping to get anything.
I'm simply observing.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.160
Do me a favor,
keep your observations to yourself.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.370
Hey.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.708
I need to talk to you outside.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.089
Thanks for the coffee.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.513
What the hell was that?

13:25.596 --> 13:27.223
Why are you being rude to Cameron?

13:27.306 --> 13:28.641
He got under my skin.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.684
Okay. What are you doing here?

13:30.768 --> 13:32.019
I need five minutes.

13:33.270 --> 13:37.608
What happened last night was unacceptable,
and I'm sorry I made you worry.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.444
Okay, you know what?
Worry doesn't come close.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.904
I thought you were in a ditch.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.864
-I couldn't drive.
-Oh, right.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.741
Right. You couldn't drive.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.995
-What happened to quitting?
-Last night was an exception.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.915
The night of my sister's wedding
was an exception.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.000
Look, it's not gonna happen again.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.795
-How am I supposed to believe you?
-I made a decision.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.881
I'm done. I'm done with drinking.
I'm done with living in the past.

14:00.965 --> 14:05.427
Jack, trauma is not a switch
you can turn on and off by yourself.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.763
I know. I get it.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.557
-You get it?
-Yeah.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.767
Then why do we keep having
this conversation?

14:14.270 --> 14:16.605
You know what?
I can't talk to you anymore.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.203
Hey, Stacie.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.247
Hi. Oh, I'm glad you answered.

14:33.330 --> 14:37.042
-So can you meet me for dinner?
-<i>Tonight's not a good night. I--</i>

14:37.126 --> 14:38.711
I really need to see you.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.880
I know, but I didn't sleep
at all last night.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.089
Can we do it tomorrow?

14:42.172 --> 14:44.884
<i>Paul and I are leaving in the morning.</i>
<i>What if you go early?</i>

14:55.895 --> 14:58.314
Hey. Here to pick up Hope's lunch order.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.692
-Tuna on rye?
-Unfortunately, that's the one.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.194
-Not a fan of tuna?
-Not when it's in my car.

15:05.863 --> 15:10.326
Hey, so Ten Pins in Clear River's doing
cosmic bowling tonight. Wanna go?

15:10.409 --> 15:11.410
Um...

15:12.369 --> 15:14.997
I can't. Preacher's leaving early,
so I'm closing tonight.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.042
-How about tomorrow night?
-Maybe. I'll have to check with Connie.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.336
Okay. No worries.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.004
Just let me know.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.714
-Okay.
-See you later.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.352
-Why are you lying to him?
-Why are you spying on me?

15:36.435 --> 15:39.521
I have never seen you volunteer
to talk to Connie about anything.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.107
-Ugh. You're so annoying.
-But I'm right.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.654
Fine. I was looking for a phone charger

15:46.737 --> 15:49.156
and I found a stash
of Klonopin in Denny's stuff.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.241
-What did you do?
-I told Doc.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.576
Why did you do that?

15:52.660 --> 15:54.870
Because it wasn't prescribed to him,

15:54.954 --> 15:57.539
and if Denny has a drug problem,
Doc should know about it.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.709
If it was his dad or grandma, maybe
they gave it to him to help him sleep.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.628
He doesn't seem like an addict.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.841
You think he has a good reason
for having those pills?

16:07.925 --> 16:10.761
He might. You'd have to ask.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.016
You're right. Thanks.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.477
-For what?
-Being such a good friend.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.359
Hey, Ricky. How's it going?

16:27.444 --> 16:28.570
Love sucks, Preach.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.416
Come in.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.088
Okay. If you're here
to read me the riot act, don't.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.923
I know perfectly well what I did.

16:48.007 --> 16:53.137
I just came by to say,
if you need anything, I'm here for you.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.181
-God, I screwed up, Brie.
-Right.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.891
Because you're human.

16:57.975 --> 17:01.895
Why are you being so understanding?
I've been pretty tough on you.

17:01.979 --> 17:06.734
Oof. I know. You gave me a free place
to live, you helped me get a job,

17:06.817 --> 17:09.778
introduced me to your friends,
I can't believe we're still talking.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.490
Well, you're family.
I'm always gonna look out for you.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.242
It goes both ways.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.249
How's Sugar? Have you been riding?

17:22.958 --> 17:24.710
Few times, but it's hard.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.838
I keep expecting my mom's
gonna walk out of the barn to greet us.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.299
And that'll never happen again.

17:32.801 --> 17:36.096
You've been so brave,
and taking care of Chloe...

17:36.680 --> 17:40.601
I should be thanking Chloe.
She's the reason I get out of bed.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.438
In fact, I should relieve the sitter.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.190
Oh. Oh.

17:46.774 --> 17:50.652
Thanks for coming over.
I didn't have it in me to face the farm.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.862
I totally get it.

17:51.945 --> 17:55.199
You know, it can be bittersweet,
but when I'm out there,

17:55.282 --> 17:58.452
I feel like Mom's all around me.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.330
Wish I had a place like that.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.247
So make one.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.710
Go somewhere you think
she'd have loved and make it your spot.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.628
And do what?

18:08.504 --> 18:10.547
Nothing.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.217
Just reflect.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.678
I'm not very good at sitting still.
Let alone being quiet.

18:17.513 --> 18:21.809
Well, might be worth trying.
It's been really good for me.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.395
-Thank you.
-Oh, sweetheart, thank you.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.860
<i>You've reached Denny,</i>
<i>please leave a message.</i>

18:31.944 --> 18:33.821
Denny, Denny, it's Doc.

18:33.904 --> 18:37.783
I was wondering
if you would stop by the clinic today.

18:39.535 --> 18:43.872
There's something I want
to discuss with you, privately. Bye.

18:49.753 --> 18:53.298
-Hey.
-Hey. How are you?

18:55.008 --> 18:56.260
Ah.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.219
I'm okay.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.931
-Could have taken the day off.
-I know.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.560
I just didn't want
to be alone with my thoughts.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.812
Oh, I have been there, believe me.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.858
-And you and Jack have a lot going on.
-Yeah, we do.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.823
Look, I'm not making an excuse
for what Jack did, but, uh...

19:20.117 --> 19:23.829
The veteran's experience
is uniquely complex.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.539
-I know.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.169
I know, I just--
I don't know how he'll get out

19:30.252 --> 19:32.379
of this destructive cycle
if he won't get help.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.506
It's the fear.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.427
The fear of reliving the pain...

19:39.469 --> 19:41.221
that trumps reason.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.184
Maybe this will clarify things. Uh...

19:45.809 --> 19:49.730
January 31, 1968,
was one of the biggest campaigns

19:49.813 --> 19:52.065
by the North Vietnamese
in the Vietnam War.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.026
Took me 30 years

19:54.109 --> 19:59.615
before I could say
the phrase "Tet Offensive" out loud.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.034
It was that bad.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.161
Doc, I'm so sorry.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.747
-I'm not telling you this for sympathy,

20:06.830 --> 20:11.585
I'm trying to explain how deep
some vets bury the trauma of war

20:11.668 --> 20:14.004
in order to function day to day.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.673
Not something I'm ever gonna understand.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.259
I feel so helpless.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.262
All I'm saying is don't give up on him.

20:24.348 --> 20:28.518
What you guys have is--
Well, it's worth fighting for.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.358
-Yeah.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.738
Well, someone is really trying
to get ahold of you.

20:40.864 --> 20:44.368
It's Stacie, my sister-in-law.
She wants to have dinner tonight.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.203
It's not like you to avoid someone.

20:46.286 --> 20:50.165
I don't know if that's entirely true,
but I'm just exhausted.

20:51.375 --> 20:55.379
And she is, uh... difficult.

20:57.214 --> 21:01.635
I know it is your nature
to put others' needs above your own,

21:01.718 --> 21:03.971
but give yourself a break on this one.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.847
Just do what's best for you.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.641
Yeah.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.870
Hello, Daniel.

21:30.289 --> 21:34.543
-It's Brady. Do I know you?
-We have not been formally introduced.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.003
I'm Melissa.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.465
-And?
-And this is my operation.

21:40.549 --> 21:44.344
Well, it's a family business,
but I run the day-to-day.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.262
That so?

21:46.596 --> 21:49.808
And how do I know
you are who you are and not some cop?

21:50.517 --> 21:54.021
Calvin promised you the keys
to the kingdom when he retired.

21:54.104 --> 21:54.938
Is that right?

21:55.981 --> 21:59.735
I also know
your collaboration with law enforcement

21:59.818 --> 22:01.903
precipitated the raid on Emerald Lumber.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.781
-That's not true.
-Cut the crap, Brady.

22:04.865 --> 22:09.619
If there's one thing I cannot stomach,
it's a liar. Just ask Calvin.

22:10.829 --> 22:15.917
-That's why he's been... demoted.
-So why are you still dealing with me?

22:16.752 --> 22:21.214
Because you have collateral,
which I believe will keep you in line.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.841
You're talking about the business?

22:22.924 --> 22:28.013
Oh. I'm talking about
your girlfriend, Brie.

22:28.096 --> 22:32.142
-Now, when the shipment arrives--
-Like I told Calvin...

22:33.602 --> 22:35.270
I don't deal with the drugs.

22:35.979 --> 22:41.318
Well, our night business
might spill into your day business.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.779
So I'm gonna need you to cooperate.

22:43.862 --> 22:44.696
Fine.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.491
But just so you know...

22:48.075 --> 22:49.868
if anything happens to Brie...

22:50.744 --> 22:52.120
I'll burn this place down.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.164
Ooh. Passionate.

22:54.873 --> 22:55.707
I like that.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.251
I'll be in touch.

23:11.014 --> 23:14.434
I went to the clerk's office
to check for small water sources.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.646
But when I pulled up a topography map,
I found an inconsistency.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.023
On a current map,
you won't find any water sources

23:20.107 --> 23:24.152
near Shelter Mountain,
but an older map clearly shows a reservoir

23:24.236 --> 23:26.446
-just east of the lower bridge.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.365
-Where's the map?
-In my car.

23:29.324 --> 23:33.578
-Okay. Sounds good. I'll go check it out.
-Well, we'll go.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.374
-I found the map. I'm going with you.
-No. Brie, it--

23:38.208 --> 23:40.502
It's not safe. Calvin's probably armed.

23:42.087 --> 23:45.298
I've gotten this far.
I'm not just gonna walk away now.

23:46.842 --> 23:47.676
Okay.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.429
Fine, but I'm calling for backup.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.598
And if anything goes down,
you follow my orders.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.475
For example?

23:56.685 --> 23:57.686
If I say "run"...

23:58.603 --> 23:59.563
you run.

24:05.485 --> 24:06.736
Didn't want to startle you.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.531
Come in. Sit down.

24:11.908 --> 24:14.202
Sorry it took me so long to get here.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.580
-I was hiking.
-It's okay.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.917
-So you wanted to see me.
-Yes.

24:23.378 --> 24:26.173
No easy way to say this,
so I'll just be direct.

24:26.965 --> 24:30.302
It has come to my attention
you have a bottle of Klonopin

24:30.385 --> 24:33.346
that is not in your name.
And in addition to that,

24:33.430 --> 24:36.266
I suspect you went through
the clinic's financial files,

24:36.349 --> 24:38.185
which are highly confidential.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.689
And after the incident
with the drug cabinet...

24:43.815 --> 24:47.486
I gotta think to myself
there's something seriously wrong here.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.280
I did go through the clinic's financials
without permission.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.532
Why? Why would you do that?

24:52.616 --> 24:54.159
When my dad passed away...

24:56.369 --> 24:57.746
I got a big insurance payout.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.833
It's a lot of money.
I wanna use it for something good.

25:02.501 --> 25:06.129
Something that'll help people
and live on in his memory.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.423
I'm not following you here.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.800
I used the funds
to pay off the clinic's mortgage.

25:10.884 --> 25:14.095
Thought it'd be cool if you received
a zero-balance mortgage statement.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.558
Wow, I--

25:20.227 --> 25:23.313
I don't know what to say,
except thank you.

25:23.396 --> 25:25.357
That is extremely generous.

25:27.442 --> 25:31.905
You and your practice help so many people.
This is what my dad would've wanted.

25:34.324 --> 25:35.450
I'm glad you think so.

25:37.410 --> 25:41.164
But I still gotta ask,
what about the prescription?

25:42.290 --> 25:45.168
Now, if I tell you, you're gonna look
at me differently, and I--

25:45.710 --> 25:48.505
-I don't know if I can stand that.
-I have trusted you so far.

25:48.588 --> 25:51.341
It's time you gave me
the benefit of the doubt.

25:53.969 --> 25:58.598
And you promise you won't tell anyone?
Even if you think you're trying to help.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.482
I give you my word.

26:23.623 --> 26:24.708
Muriel.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.295
If you're trying
to get me to like you, you're winning.

26:46.521 --> 26:47.856
Bench is beautiful.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.275
So is the garden.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.612
What's going on?

26:53.695 --> 26:55.030
You're struggling.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.949
You're not real.

26:58.867 --> 27:02.245
-That's up to you.
-None of this has been up to me.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.665
If it were, you'd be alive and...

27:07.000 --> 27:09.628
I wouldn't have been
in that stupid accident.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.506
I wouldn't be sitting here
missing you so much.

27:13.590 --> 27:16.384
My brain is playing tricks on me.

27:17.093 --> 27:18.345
It's 'cause you're hurting.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.557
I never even got to say goodbye.

27:24.934 --> 27:27.103
I miss you so much.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.022
My heart hurts.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.232
Now that you're gone...

27:33.526 --> 27:35.945
there's a huge hole in my life.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.989
How can I ever fill it?

27:38.073 --> 27:40.325
Look to those who love you most.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.484
-Stacie?
-Mel.

28:15.318 --> 28:16.152
I--

28:16.236 --> 28:20.407
-I wasn't sure if you would actually come.
-Well, I'm here for Mark.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.034
If you needed something,
he would have shown up, so...

28:23.118 --> 28:24.077
Oh.

28:25.078 --> 28:25.912
Yeah.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.708
Mel, I know that I have been...

28:30.250 --> 28:32.335
I've been terrible to you.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.087
Yeah, that reminds me, I, uh...

28:35.004 --> 28:36.297
I got your sonogram.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.882
Oh, I'm so sorry. I--

28:38.717 --> 28:40.009
I shouldn't have sent that.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.011
It was insensitive.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.933
I also apologize
for asking for your wedding ring.

28:47.016 --> 28:48.727
It was totally inappropriate.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.562
Oh.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.399
Uh, wow. Okay.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.109
Um...

28:58.486 --> 29:02.365
-Thank you. Thank you for apologizing.
-I really mean it.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.283
I believe you.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.869
Yeah, we're really excited.

29:07.203 --> 29:09.664
Just having a hard time
with knowing that my daughter

29:09.748 --> 29:12.083
is never gonna meet her uncle Mark.

29:12.167 --> 29:15.503
I'm sure it's hard
not being able to share this with him.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.130
Yeah, it is.

29:18.339 --> 29:22.218
Mel, Mark loved you so much.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.973
And you knew him better
than anybody, so I was thinking

29:27.056 --> 29:31.603
if we work together, we could help
keep Mark's memory alive for my daughter.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.106
Yeah, that would be nice.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.902
I'm glad that you called.

29:38.985 --> 29:43.323
Actually, nobody knows this yet,
but we're gonna name her Monroe for Mark.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.325
Oh, Stacie.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.370
Mark would be thrilled.

29:58.421 --> 30:00.215
Are you really that mad at me?

30:00.882 --> 30:01.716
What now?

30:02.258 --> 30:06.554
Well, my aunt from Portland
is throwing a baby shower for Todd and I,

30:06.638 --> 30:09.057
and we sent out the invitations last week

30:09.140 --> 30:11.434
and I haven't gotten a response
from you or Mel.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.896
-We didn't get an invitation.
-Well, I'm positive I sent it.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.147
It didn't arrive.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.399
Okay. Well, um...

30:19.567 --> 30:21.361
all the information's in here.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.488
The club had a cancellation,

30:23.571 --> 30:26.366
so we're having it there
instead of the B and B.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.452
Uh, there's gonna be a chocolate fountain

30:29.536 --> 30:32.539
and Todd's buying
a case of Dom for the toast.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.666
-Sounds fancy.
-You're gonna be there, right?

30:34.749 --> 30:37.836
-Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
-You were so pissed at me

30:37.919 --> 30:40.296
for not telling you the twins were boys.

30:40.380 --> 30:44.551
And one of the things I respect most
about you is that you're honest.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.929
Even when it's something
I don't wanna hear.

30:48.012 --> 30:51.349
-There were plenty of those.
-There's plenty of those.

30:51.432 --> 30:54.310
But I learned that I can depend on you.

30:54.394 --> 30:58.189
That's all I really want for the twins,
is parents they can trust.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.277
-Because I never really had that.
-I know.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.280
Thank you.

31:06.865 --> 31:10.118
You know, Char,
our boys are gonna have two parents

31:10.201 --> 31:12.453
that love
and support them unconditionally.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.371
Yeah.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.833
That's better than either of us had.

31:18.084 --> 31:21.880
-You should feel good about that.
-I do. Yeah.

31:21.963 --> 31:25.091
But there is one thing
that's kind of been bugging me.

31:26.134 --> 31:26.968
What's that?

31:27.468 --> 31:29.804
Why didn't you tell me
you and Mel are getting married?

31:29.888 --> 31:30.889
Huh?

31:32.140 --> 31:35.727
I saw Mel at a store
buying a wedding dress.

31:36.936 --> 31:39.522
No, no, her sister got married.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.857
Oh.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.568
So she was telling the truth.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.779
-Well, why wouldn't she?
-I don't know. To protect my feelings.

31:46.863 --> 31:49.908
Charmaine,
we just said I've been straight with you.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.659
-Yeah.
-All right? So is Mel.

31:51.743 --> 31:55.288
So going forward, you never have to worry
about being lied to, okay?

31:55.371 --> 31:57.999
Hey, Jack,
Barry Martinez is here to see you.

31:58.833 --> 31:59.667
Thanks.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.296
I gotta go, but we'll talk at the shower.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.548
-Okay. Thanks. Yeah.
-Thanks for the invite.

32:09.385 --> 32:12.180
Hey. Jack Sheridan. Thanks for coming.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.891
Barry. Glad you called.

32:15.850 --> 32:16.684
Yeah.

32:17.393 --> 32:20.563
Uh, why don't we speak in my office?

32:22.899 --> 32:25.693
So Preacher said
that you were in the Corps.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.739
Yeah. Third Battalion, First Marines.

32:30.657 --> 32:31.908
Oh, Thundering Third.

32:32.575 --> 32:35.495
You guys were some of the first Marines
to get into Iraq, right?

32:35.578 --> 32:36.788
Mm-hm.

32:36.871 --> 32:39.749
-So you were there for...
-Phantom Fury, yeah.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.795
Yep. It was as bad as advertised.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.715
So how did you get into this?

32:48.800 --> 32:54.555
Well, over 30 Marines from my battalion
have committed suicide since 2003.

32:55.682 --> 32:58.351
That's more
than we lost the entire operation.

32:58.434 --> 33:01.604
So I figured
if I can help just one soldier...

33:03.064 --> 33:05.024
it would honor the ones
who didn't make it home.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.944
-That's pretty noble.
-Not really. It's...

33:09.112 --> 33:10.780
It's what helped me recover.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.742
What can I do for you?

33:18.663 --> 33:21.582
Uh, I don't know.
Probably nothing. I mean, I...

33:22.834 --> 33:25.336
Just things haven't really, um...

33:26.754 --> 33:27.880
been going so well.

33:27.964 --> 33:33.261
-Have you tried therapy in the past?
-No. No, I kind of try to rely on myself

33:33.344 --> 33:35.555
-to solve my problems.
-Right.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.683
The best thing to do
is you take whatever's broken apart...

33:40.018 --> 33:42.562
and you put it back together
piece by piece.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.941
That way, you can be sure
you found the source of the problem.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.317
Okay.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.946
And how long does that take?

33:53.573 --> 33:56.451
No, if it's done correctly,
there is no timeline.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.460
Hey. Up for a visitor?

34:05.543 --> 34:06.794
Come in.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.633
Would you like to sit down?

34:13.885 --> 34:15.094
Yeah, sure.

34:20.016 --> 34:20.850
Uh...

34:22.351 --> 34:23.936
So, um...

34:25.688 --> 34:28.566
I-- Like, I didn't know if I should call.

34:28.649 --> 34:30.693
I want to apologize.

34:30.777 --> 34:34.363
I know it seems like
I've been sending you mixed messages.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.948
That was never my intent.

34:37.408 --> 34:39.994
It's just that
when you started asking me those questions

34:40.078 --> 34:42.538
about Christopher, Paige...

34:43.956 --> 34:45.458
I didn't know how to answer them.

34:47.001 --> 34:47.835
It's, um...

34:49.170 --> 34:50.922
It's not my story to tell.

34:51.005 --> 34:51.923
Mm.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.218
That's very cryptic, don't you think?

34:56.928 --> 34:59.138
Bottom line is that Paige and I...

35:01.224 --> 35:02.350
we're not together.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.144
Thank you for clarifying that.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.690
Still, I am not a clean slate.

35:09.774 --> 35:14.195
Now, if you don't wanna deal with me,
you know, I get it. I've got baggage.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.532
We all do.

35:18.866 --> 35:21.494
Truth is,
neither of us are fortune tellers.

35:21.577 --> 35:25.289
Instead, all I can do
is be as honest as possible.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.961
Well, if we are laying our cards
on the table...

35:32.130 --> 35:33.673
I have feelings for you.

35:35.716 --> 35:39.345
-And I think you have feelings for me too?
-I do.

35:40.805 --> 35:44.642
Your smile,
it knocks me out every single time.

35:50.064 --> 35:53.776
So for right now,
that is all I need to know.

36:03.744 --> 36:08.374
Thanks again for seeing me and just
for being so awesome about everything.

36:08.457 --> 36:11.669
Oh, my gosh, of course.
I can't wait to meet Monroe,

36:11.752 --> 36:14.672
and if you ever need a break,
just let me know and I'll fly down.

36:14.755 --> 36:16.174
Oh, I will take you up on that.

36:17.049 --> 36:19.844
-No, it's my treat. It's my treat.
-No, no, no.

36:19.927 --> 36:22.430
-We are celebrating you becoming a mother.
-Aw.

36:22.513 --> 36:23.806
-Okay?
-Thank you.

36:23.890 --> 36:24.932
-Thanks.
-Oh, thank you.

36:29.270 --> 36:34.233
Um, There's something I wanted
to tell you, but it's not really my place.

36:34.984 --> 36:35.943
Okay. What?

36:37.361 --> 36:38.196
Okay.

36:39.155 --> 36:43.034
Mom hired a lawyer
to seek custody of your last two embryos.

36:43.117 --> 36:43.993
What?

36:44.076 --> 36:46.287
Mark told her
that you guys had two embryos left

36:46.370 --> 36:48.956
and she got it in her head
that she could hire a surrogate

36:49.040 --> 36:50.166
and raise Mark's kid.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.378
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, that's just so insane.

36:54.462 --> 36:58.341
-I don't even know what to say.
-I totally agree and I'm so sorry.

36:59.133 --> 37:01.302
I didn't want you to be blindsided.

37:06.682 --> 37:13.314
Mm. I gotta admit, this isn't exactly
how I imagined this day ending.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.398
Mm-hm.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.665
Let me turn this thing off.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.633
-Can you just give me two minutes?
-I'm not going anywhere.

37:50.559 --> 37:51.394
Hello.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.104
<i>Preach.</i>

37:53.688 --> 37:55.648
-Christopher?
-I don't understand.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.566
Uncle Vince is acting weird.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.859
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

37:59.986 --> 38:00.820
<i>Where are you?</i>

38:01.362 --> 38:02.655
-I don't know.
<i>-Christopher,</i>

38:02.738 --> 38:06.200
this is important. You recognize anything
about where you are right now?

38:06.284 --> 38:08.661
No. We've been driving around a lot,

38:08.744 --> 38:11.831
-but Vince makes me hide in the backseat.
-Whose phone are you using?

38:11.914 --> 38:13.207
Uncle Vince's.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.834
-He let you have it?
<i>-No.</i>

38:14.917 --> 38:16.544
Usually hides his phone at night,

38:16.627 --> 38:19.463
<i>-but he fell asleep and left it out.</i>
-That's very brave of you.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.465
I remembered your number from summer camp.

38:21.549 --> 38:22.383
Good for you.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.051
<i>Preach...</i>

38:25.011 --> 38:26.095
I wanna come home.

38:26.804 --> 38:27.638
<i>I know, buddy.</i>

38:28.472 --> 38:29.974
We're gonna get you home.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.810
You sure
there isn't anything you can tell me

38:32.893 --> 38:35.730
<i>about where you are?</i>
<i>Are you near the ocean?</i>

38:35.813 --> 38:37.606
-He's awake. I gotta go.
<i>-Christopher...</i>

38:47.241 --> 38:48.117
Hey.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.586
I'm gonna take a shower.

39:00.212 --> 39:03.299
All right, can we please just talk first?

39:03.382 --> 39:06.177
-We already talked.
-So you'd rather stay mad?

39:06.260 --> 39:09.638
No. But there is nothing you could say
that's gonna make me feel better

39:09.722 --> 39:13.893
-about what happened last night.
-I know, and that's why today,

39:13.976 --> 39:15.770
I met with Preach's therapist.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.814
-You saw a therapist?
-Yeah.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.359
Barry, he's a Marine.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.195
Okay.

39:25.488 --> 39:28.908
-Why did you decide to call him?
-Because I agree with you.

39:30.659 --> 39:31.494
I need help.

39:32.661 --> 39:36.665
And I can't just keep telling you
that I'm gonna get my act together.

39:41.087 --> 39:41.921
Okay.

39:43.339 --> 39:44.173
How was it?

39:44.256 --> 39:45.925
It was awkward as hell.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.387
I agreed to do a few sessions with him.

39:50.054 --> 39:50.930
Hey, Jack...

39:52.098 --> 39:54.392
-if you're doing this for me--
-No.

39:54.475 --> 39:56.894
I mean, you're part of the reason, but...

39:58.729 --> 40:01.232
I'm tired of pretending everything's okay.

40:02.858 --> 40:05.277
You taking this step means a lot to me.

40:05.361 --> 40:08.030
I meant it when I said
everything's gonna get better, okay?

40:11.075 --> 40:12.159
I really meant it.

40:12.868 --> 40:13.702
Okay.

40:14.870 --> 40:17.373
I was scared.
I thought something had happened to you.

40:17.456 --> 40:20.960
I know, I know, I know,
and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know.

40:23.629 --> 40:24.463
I love you.

40:30.886 --> 40:35.224
-Sorry. I can't lose you. Okay?
-You're not going to. No.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.522
Everything's gonna be okay, I promise.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.440
I promise you.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.693
Listen, um...

40:47.236 --> 40:51.949
I have to tell you,
I went and had dinner with Stacie.

40:52.032 --> 40:55.744
-How did that go?
-She told me that Mark's mom, Cassandra...

40:56.787 --> 41:00.875
-wants custody of my embryos.
-Oh, come on. Is that even a thing?

41:00.958 --> 41:04.086
No, but, I mean,
anybody can file a lawsuit.

41:05.713 --> 41:09.341
-But what--? What about--?
-No, she doesn't know I'm pregnant.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.761
So if she finds out,
she's gonna want custody of the baby?

41:12.845 --> 41:13.971
I don't know.

41:14.054 --> 41:16.140
If it turns out to be Mark's baby--

41:16.223 --> 41:18.434
Think she'd go through
with something like that?

41:18.517 --> 41:21.145
I don't know.
But when Cassandra wants something,

41:21.228 --> 41:24.356
she will do anything she can to get it.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.622
-Here it is.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll wait for backup.

41:39.705 --> 41:42.208
-Well, where are they?
-I gave out the coordinates.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.501
Should be here any minute.

41:47.671 --> 41:48.881
I don't see anyone.

41:50.132 --> 41:51.091
Hey, look.

41:53.761 --> 41:54.595
Is that Calvin?

41:57.973 --> 41:58.807
Yeah.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.398
Howard, where the hell's backup?
Got eyes on Calvin.

42:06.482 --> 42:09.485
<i>We're closing in now.</i>
<i>Do not engage. I repeat, do not engage.</i>

42:19.411 --> 42:20.579
Crap. He knows we're here.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.085
He's getting aw--
