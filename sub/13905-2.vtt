We'll have a lovely, romantic
evening.

14:42.994 --> 14:44.954
(GENTLE CLASSICAL MUSIC)

14:46.834 --> 14:48.794
(DOORBELL)

14:50.794 --> 14:52.839
Good. You're here. What?

14:52.874 --> 14:55.994
What do you want? Don't you ever
listen? Stop coming here.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.559
Happily.

14:57.594 --> 15:00.039
Just give me Stephanie's book,

15:00.074 --> 15:03.954
let me run the agency and I'll flit
away out of your life.

15:05.634 --> 15:06.999
What?

15:07.034 --> 15:08.994
Oh, so that's what this is all about.

15:09.674 --> 15:12.194
You hate the job, you're not suited
to it.

15:12.834 --> 15:15.394
Why not hand it over to someone
who'd do it better?

15:17.474 --> 15:19.954
Look, I know what you're trying to
do,

15:19.989 --> 15:22.399
coming here and making ridiculous
requests

15:22.434 --> 15:26.114
but Stephanie asked me to take over
the business and I can handle it.

15:26.149 --> 15:28.074
And, what's more, I can handle you.

15:29.874 --> 15:32.114
You're quite... fun...

15:33.154 --> 15:35.114
.. when you're angry, aren't you?

15:36.394 --> 15:39.074
Yes. Now fuck off.

15:39.634 --> 15:40.994
Ooh.

15:45.714 --> 15:47.274
(Ouch.)

15:48.394 --> 15:50.399
Yeah, it's 250 an hour.

15:50.434 --> 15:52.634
Mm-hm. Yeah, she does do that.

15:53.794 --> 15:55.754
Yeah, and that.

15:56.154 --> 15:58.594
Yes, and that. Yeah, she loves it.
Yeah.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.279
Er, no... no, Jeff,

16:02.314 --> 16:04.274
because no-one does that.

16:06.954 --> 16:08.959
(I'm so sorry.)

16:08.994 --> 16:11.034
OK, Jeff, all right. Thank you.

16:11.069 --> 16:13.079
OK, bye. Bye.

16:13.114 --> 16:15.834
I'm so sorry, Ben. I'm sorry about
this afternoon.

16:16.314 --> 16:18.994
Me and Poppy had a great time. No,
no, I fucked up.

16:19.029 --> 16:21.399
I'm sorry. I promise I won't do it
again. OK.

16:21.434 --> 16:24.434
And no more clients back at the
house. No more clients.

16:24.469 --> 16:26.754
You - I don't want them to be there.
I know.

16:26.789 --> 16:28.714
Where are we going?

16:29.154 --> 16:31.114
Ah, well...

16:31.914 --> 16:34.399
Restaurants and musicals... Yeah.

16:34.434 --> 16:37.274
.. and all that date stuff you do for
work, right? Mm.

16:37.874 --> 16:39.919
This is something different.

16:39.954 --> 16:43.354
In fact, if you have been here for
work it's so totally over. Mm.

16:46.274 --> 16:48.394
Hey. Hi, Mum. Ben, Hannah.

16:49.794 --> 16:51.799
Oh, hello. Hello.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.799
Great to see you. It's been so long.

16:54.834 --> 16:58.154
Come in. I've got to go straight
through to the kitchen.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.434
What happened to taking it slowly?

17:01.469 --> 17:02.994
Well...

17:06.834 --> 17:09.354
Right. What's for dinner, Mum?

17:09.914 --> 17:12.154
OK, two words, Ben. What? Two words.
What?

17:13.034 --> 17:16.154
What? Skinny dipping. That was your
idea and you know it.

17:16.189 --> 17:18.114
Guilty. Guilty. Sorry, Anna.

17:18.714 --> 17:22.794
Don't mind me. I was at art school with
people who never put their clothes on.

17:23.114 --> 17:25.074
(MOBILE RINGS)

17:27.154 --> 17:29.394
I'm so sorry. That was great, Mum,
thanks.

17:29.994 --> 17:32.719
Shall I make us some coffee? Yeah.
And chocolate.

17:32.754 --> 17:35.714
Bring the chocolates. Yeah, bring
them. Great. Thank you.

17:40.714 --> 17:42.714
I read your book.

17:43.994 --> 17:45.799
What book?

17:45.834 --> 17:47.794
The one you wrote.

17:48.754 --> 17:51.474
No, sorry, I don't know... know what
you mean.

17:52.834 --> 17:55.554
We have quite a forward-thinking
book group.

17:56.274 --> 17:58.434
It's always interesting to see
what...

18:00.954 --> 18:02.914
.. gets passed off as feminism.

18:04.514 --> 18:06.559
OK.

18:06.594 --> 18:09.639
(READS) Jeremy is the sort of man
who, aged seven,

18:09.674 --> 18:14.354
told his mother he wasn't going to school
today because he wanted to help her make pots.

18:17.674 --> 18:19.474
I mean, it's Ben, isn't it?

18:21.874 --> 18:26.074
Hannah, I'm not judging what you do
or what you've done.

18:26.874 --> 18:30.679
God knows, I slept with half of
Camberwell in the '70s.

18:30.714 --> 18:35.594
Mm, maybe I shouldn't have raised
him in such a liberal environment.

18:36.834 --> 18:39.434
Hi, Mum. Hello, darling.

18:41.474 --> 18:43.434
Um, wow, um...

18:44.074 --> 18:46.714
I'm sure you didn't... Are you still
working?

18:46.749 --> 18:49.239
Um, yeah, but a lot less.

18:49.274 --> 18:51.514
But you're still working. Yeah.

18:52.954 --> 18:55.874
Look, I don't know what's going on
between you and Ben

18:55.909 --> 18:57.834
but I know how he feels about you.

18:58.954 --> 19:02.954
Do you really think you can keep working
and commit to him at the same time?

19:06.954 --> 19:10.354
So that was um... that was grown up.

19:10.754 --> 19:12.954
The tagine was good, right? Really
good.

19:13.834 --> 19:16.554
So what now? Have you got to work?
No.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.514
Let's...

19:18.954 --> 19:20.994
I've been neglecting you. I'm sorry.

19:22.154 --> 19:24.199
I'm really sorry.

19:24.234 --> 19:27.634
Why don't we go and do something?
Let's go out and do something.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.194
I've got an idea. OK.

19:31.674 --> 19:33.714
You're not looking, are you? No.

19:33.749 --> 19:35.714
All right.

19:38.274 --> 19:40.314
I used to break in here when I was
14.

19:40.349 --> 19:42.234
Oops.
(WATER SPLASHES) Whoa.

19:43.074 --> 19:45.074
My feet are soaked.

19:46.874 --> 19:48.874
Stay here. Keep them closed.

20:00.674 --> 20:02.634
BOTH: Whoo!

20:04.714 --> 20:05.994
Oww!

20:11.274 --> 20:14.514
So was the gramophone a present for
me or a present for us?

20:16.914 --> 20:18.634
Really?

20:20.194 --> 20:22.954
Well, if you moved in...

20:24.514 --> 20:26.514
.. you could play records on it too.

20:34.634 --> 20:38.274
Now who isn't taking things slowly?
Fuck slowly. I want you with me.

20:39.594 --> 20:41.634
Fuck slowly, huh? Yeah.

20:41.669 --> 20:43.594
So romantic.

20:44.554 --> 20:46.494
Yeah? So that's a yes?

20:46.529 --> 20:48.434
Yeah, I'd love to.

21:00.314 --> 21:02.634
There is
such a thing as overconfidence.

21:02.669 --> 21:06.119
Fuck. Jackie's here. Yay!

21:06.154 --> 21:09.874
She's great, isn't she, Belle? She
looks after the girls really nice.

21:09.909 --> 21:12.371
What do you mean 'she looks after
the girls'?

21:12.406 --> 21:15.380
MAN: Kat got herself into a spot of
bother.

21:15.415 --> 21:18.354
Who are you, please? You don't know
me... yet.

21:18.389 --> 21:20.354
But I know you, Belle.
