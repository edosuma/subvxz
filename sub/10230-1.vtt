04:13.028 --> 04:18.829
<i>"And the choir keeps singing of freedom"</i>

04:34.016 --> 04:35.916
<i>I come from Arkansas originally.</i>

04:35.985 --> 04:37.714
I went to school at Tuskegee and...

04:39.255 --> 04:40.347
<i>...met my wife there.</i>

04:40.422 --> 04:44.358
<i>My first job after I left Tuskegee
was in Mississippi.</i>

04:44.727 --> 04:46.194
<i>It was his junior year also.</i>

04:46.295 --> 04:48.058
He'd been to the service.

04:48.964 --> 04:51.865
I walked in with my so-called boyfriend...

04:52.034 --> 04:55.526
...in the lounge where the girls sat...

04:56.472 --> 04:58.702
...and he was with his girlfriend...

04:59.341 --> 05:01.866
...and I thought I was looking good.

05:02.478 --> 05:05.038
I'd just made this suit that I had on...

05:05.281 --> 05:08.478
...and he said, "Looks good.
Turn around and let me see it. "

05:08.584 --> 05:11.314
And I didn't have any better sense
than to do it.

05:11.387 --> 05:14.083
But we didn't have anything else
to do with each other...

05:14.156 --> 05:15.521
...other than just friendship...

05:15.591 --> 05:18.992
...until our senior year.

05:19.428 --> 05:21.760
I always said in a joking manner...

05:21.830 --> 05:24.390
...that I saw her at Tuskegee...

05:24.900 --> 05:28.631
...and felt that I would be a missionary...

05:28.737 --> 05:30.602
...and come to Alabama and help her out.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.197
So, I've been helping her out
for 46 years now.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.275
<i>What I wanted in life for myself...</i>

05:35.477 --> 05:39.004
<i>...was a husband, a house,
and some children.</i>

05:41.016 --> 05:42.540
When I met Chris...

05:42.985 --> 05:46.216
...and we did have this child, I was excited.

05:46.655 --> 05:48.782
But there was one little conflict.

05:49.058 --> 05:52.960
I couldn't leave my mama alone.
I had to come back to Birmingham...

05:53.495 --> 05:57.056
<i>...have the baby in Birmingham,
with a doctor that I was familiar with...</i>

05:57.299 --> 06:01.065
<i>...and he didn't like that too hot,
but he did consent.</i>

06:01.937 --> 06:04.030
<i>Denise was a very charming child...</i>

06:04.340 --> 06:06.205
...a very lovable child...

06:06.675 --> 06:09.439
...and a very caring child.

06:09.511 --> 06:10.671
I think she spent...

06:10.746 --> 06:14.113
<i>...most of her time
trying to do for other children.</i>

06:14.183 --> 06:17.516
<i>She had a good group of friends
that lived in the community.</i>

06:17.586 --> 06:20.487
<i>A lot of times she would come down
to my house.</i>

06:21.323 --> 06:24.417
She loved to come over here,
because at that time...

06:24.960 --> 06:26.791
<i>...she was an only child.</i>

06:26.895 --> 06:30.763
And there were four children
in this house...

06:31.000 --> 06:33.560
...two girls and two boys.

06:34.336 --> 06:37.794
She couldn't wait to find out
what everything was about...

06:38.440 --> 06:40.032
<i>...see what this is...</i>

06:40.175 --> 06:43.144
<i>...and know what this person is,
and talk to everybody.</i>

06:43.479 --> 06:45.037
<i>She was very friendly...</i>

06:45.247 --> 06:47.010
...and seemingly very happy.

06:47.783 --> 06:51.446
<i>Very aggressive, very feisty.</i>

06:52.388 --> 06:55.357
<i>Obviously,
when somebody's not around you...</i>

06:55.557 --> 06:59.459
<i>...you tend to praise sometimes
even where praise may not be due.</i>

06:59.928 --> 07:02.226
Very inquisitive...

07:03.232 --> 07:04.699
...and very much a leader.

07:05.067 --> 07:08.901
She was a very lovable little girI.
And I miss her.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.491
<i>When I came here in the '50s...</i>

07:32.561 --> 07:34.927
<i>...to get a job was a real chore...</i>

07:35.497 --> 07:38.466
...especially if you came
to this blue-collar town...

07:38.567 --> 07:40.228
...and you had a college degree.

07:40.302 --> 07:42.827
You were going to steel mills
and places like that...

07:42.938 --> 07:44.132
<i>...making applications...</i>

07:44.206 --> 07:46.800
<i>...and nobody was looking
for college graduates.</i>

07:46.909 --> 07:48.672
<i>Birmingham's a steel town.</i>

07:49.578 --> 07:52.672
<i>Birmingham was built in the late 1800s...</i>

07:52.748 --> 07:56.047
<i>...by the barons from the North,
who came down...</i>

07:56.151 --> 07:59.120
...and realized
that we had every combination.

07:59.388 --> 08:03.620
We had people, we had natural resources,
we had rubber transportation.

08:04.588 --> 08:05.111
<i>It grew by leaps and bounds.</i>

08:05.188 --> 08:07.850
<i>It was known as the "Magic City"
because it grew so fast.</i>

08:07.925 --> 08:12.419
<i>But you had people coming in,
a laboring class of people...</i>

08:12.529 --> 08:15.293
...a blue-collar town.
And it was a violent town.

08:15.766 --> 08:20.169
It was a town of union violence,
condoned the violence against workers...

08:20.237 --> 08:22.865
...condoned by the police
and by United States Steel...

08:22.940 --> 08:24.999
...and the other big industrial companies.

08:25.075 --> 08:28.408
It had a long history of labor violence.

08:28.745 --> 08:30.770
So you had a tradition of violence...

08:31.748 --> 08:35.376
<i>...flowing out of an industrial setting,
with the overlay of rural racism...</i>

08:35.485 --> 08:39.216
<i>...coming in from the countryside.
Traditional old South racism.</i>

08:39.323 --> 08:41.120
<i>With that background...</i>

08:42.025 --> 08:45.222
...the '50s were a time of quietness here.

08:46.196 --> 08:50.895
<i>A wonderful place to live
and raise a family.</i>

08:52.402 --> 08:55.803
Birmingham was just Birmingham.

08:56.907 --> 09:01.037
<i>White, colored.
Not white, black. White, colored.</i>

09:01.545 --> 09:04.605
<i>You would have to have lived here
to understand...</i>

09:04.681 --> 09:08.117
...some of the feelings
that were going on at that time.

09:08.518 --> 09:11.578
Black people were in their places
and white folks in theirs...

09:11.655 --> 09:12.986
...if there's such a thing.

09:13.790 --> 09:15.758
<i>The water fountains, black and white...</i>

09:15.826 --> 09:19.819
<i>...and all of those kinds of things existed,
and existed in order.</i>

09:19.963 --> 09:21.863
<i>You may see in some of the pictures...</i>

09:21.932 --> 09:25.060
<i>...cabs which said; "Colored only,"
or; "White only. "</i>

09:25.168 --> 09:28.137
A bathroom at the bus station,
"White only. "

09:28.238 --> 09:29.933
I have an older brother.

09:30.107 --> 09:32.132
There were two of us,
nine or ten months apart...

09:32.209 --> 09:34.939
...and my mother
would have to make a choice.

09:35.412 --> 09:36.674
She would always...

09:36.780 --> 09:39.840
<i>...let one of us use the white fountain,
the other use the black.</i>

09:39.916 --> 09:43.511
<i>She knew that was in violation of the law,
but she did it anyway.</i>

09:43.620 --> 09:47.886
It was so hard to tell your child,
your 6 or 7-year-old...

09:47.958 --> 09:51.416
...when it's time for water,
you know they wanted some water...

09:51.628 --> 09:55.189
...and maybe the child
attempted to go to a fountain...

09:55.265 --> 09:56.926
...that was marked for white.

09:57.267 --> 09:58.996
And you would have to tell him:

09:59.102 --> 10:02.230
"No, let's take this fountain. "
And he'd say:

10:02.372 --> 10:05.739
"Why can't I go to that one?
There's nobody there. "

10:05.809 --> 10:09.176
And I'd say: "No, we'll just use this one. "
It was an awfuI time.

10:09.279 --> 10:12.214
It was an awfuI time for young people,
I'd say...

10:12.282 --> 10:15.012
...to grow up in this city.

10:15.519 --> 10:19.353
<i>When my daughter Denise
was about 6 years old...</i>

10:19.589 --> 10:24.219
I've always despised
going shopping with my wife...

10:24.761 --> 10:28.720
<i>...because my patience didn't hold
to go shopping, you know...</i>

10:28.965 --> 10:32.560
But at any rate,
this was Christmas and we were shopping.

10:33.837 --> 10:37.739
We had come to a store.
In fact, it was Kress's.

10:38.141 --> 10:40.507
We were going in there
to buy some ribbons.

10:41.078 --> 10:43.273
And when we got in to Kress's...

10:44.214 --> 10:46.614
<i>...Denise said she had to go
to the restroom.</i>

10:46.717 --> 10:49.208
So, we went downstairs
where the restrooms were...

10:49.352 --> 10:50.842
...black and white again...

10:51.088 --> 10:54.615
...black and colored, I beg your pardon.
White and colored.

10:55.759 --> 10:58.956
So, when we got down there,
the lunch counter was also there.

10:59.029 --> 11:01.020
You could smell the onion,
the hamburgers...

11:01.098 --> 11:03.566
...and Denise said she wanted a sandwich.

11:03.800 --> 11:07.167
And it was kind of painfuI to say:
"No, you can't have it. "

11:07.237 --> 11:09.228
She wanted to know why.

11:09.706 --> 11:13.267
And we had to tell her
the sage old story about:

11:13.844 --> 11:16.108
"Whites can only eat here, but we can't.

11:16.179 --> 11:19.945
"We will eat when we get home. "
She didn't understand that so hot.

11:20.183 --> 11:24.643
That was the night that I made up my mind
that I guess I had to tell her...

11:24.721 --> 11:27.622
...she couldn't have that sandwich
because she was black.

11:27.724 --> 11:31.023
I guess for men it's worse
than it is for women...

11:32.295 --> 11:35.731
...because they are more sensitive...

11:35.799 --> 11:38.029
...or I guess that's what you might call it.

11:38.101 --> 11:41.696
They hate to say: "My child can't do
what everybody else's child can do...

11:41.805 --> 11:45.070
"... and it makes me mad
that I can't do anything about it.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.434
"I can't change it right now. "

11:47.911 --> 11:52.075
I want you to know that night
couldn't have been any more painfuI...

11:52.182 --> 11:55.640
...than seeing her laying up there
with a rock smashed in her head...

11:55.719 --> 11:59.086
...than to tell her I couldn't buy her
that sandwich down there...

11:59.156 --> 12:00.987
...because she was black.

12:01.525 --> 12:03.652
I'm not sure if she ever understood that.

12:03.727 --> 12:06.161
How did she react when you told her that?

12:07.130 --> 12:09.963
Very strange, very confused and...

12:10.367 --> 12:14.531
...as if a whole world of betrayal
had fallen on her at that moment.

12:18.842 --> 12:21.333
<i>I remember Carole as a very vivacious...</i>

12:22.479 --> 12:24.811
<i>...lovable 14-year-old.</i>

12:25.448 --> 12:28.611
<i>The third child of Alfa and Alvin...</i>

12:29.219 --> 12:31.813
<i>...and very well loved
and taken care of in the family.</i>

12:32.222 --> 12:36.522
Quite active in her schoolwork,
quite active in her church work.

12:36.626 --> 12:41.154
<i>I always remember when she was born,
my father telling me...</i>

12:41.264 --> 12:45.496
...that I was standing outside
in front of the house with my skates on...

12:45.569 --> 12:49.232
...announcing to everybody
that I had a brand new baby sister...

12:49.306 --> 12:52.537
...and I was so happy to have a little sister.

12:52.709 --> 12:57.078
<i>Carole was a very giving, outgoing person.</i>

12:57.480 --> 13:00.244
She had a lot of friends.

13:00.650 --> 13:02.345
<i>She was a beautiful daughter.</i>

13:02.419 --> 13:06.515
<i>She was an average kid, growing up.</i>

13:06.623 --> 13:10.889
<i>She was smart, she played music,
she was a Scout.</i>

13:11.461 --> 13:16.728
<i>An avid reader, she worked with the library
assistants' groups in the city and state.</i>

13:18.435 --> 13:22.030
She took dancing lessons.
She didn't play the piano, though.

13:22.138 --> 13:26.006
<i>I used to have to take her
to the Saturday movies with me.</i>

13:26.142 --> 13:28.269
They were segregated.

13:28.345 --> 13:32.076
We'd have to go upstairs into the balcony.

13:32.148 --> 13:35.515
We'd sit and we'd throw popcorn and ice.

13:35.752 --> 13:38.516
We would throw them down
on the white folks.

13:40.223 --> 13:42.691
She always thought that was real funny...

13:42.926 --> 13:46.362
...but she knew that we were not supposed
to be doing that.

13:46.429 --> 13:48.329
So it was like, "I'm gonna tell. "

13:48.832 --> 13:53.701
<i>She played clarinet in the band
at elementary school and high school.</i>

13:53.837 --> 13:56.897
<i>She was supposed to play her first game.</i>

13:57.774 --> 13:59.708
<i>That Monday night, after they were...</i>

13:59.809 --> 14:03.711
<i>After the bombing,
the band was supposed to play.</i>

14:04.147 --> 14:07.241
<i>Parker was playing somebody,
I've forgotten who.</i>

14:07.984 --> 14:12.284
This is her last sash...

14:12.522 --> 14:14.353
...with the badges.

14:14.424 --> 14:17.393
She was a member, at that time...

14:17.460 --> 14:19.451
...of Troop 264.

14:19.863 --> 14:23.629
And those were the badges
that she had earned...

14:24.701 --> 14:26.692
...in the process.

14:27.437 --> 14:30.634
She had been a Scout all along...

14:30.707 --> 14:32.834
...from Brownie on up.

14:33.243 --> 14:37.737
This Bible, she had in her pocketbook...

14:38.581 --> 14:40.310
...the day of the bombing.

14:40.517 --> 14:43.748
When we got it, it had dirt, grit...

14:43.820 --> 14:46.015
...and part of this was torn out.

14:48.591 --> 14:51.025
For a long time,
I kept it in my pocketbook...

14:51.094 --> 14:53.722
...but I've taken it out now
and I've put it up...

14:53.797 --> 14:56.322
...and look at it every now and then.

14:57.534 --> 15:01.766
In 1949, my last year in college...

15:01.972 --> 15:05.464
...I went through Birmingham
with my boss...

15:05.542 --> 15:08.739
...I worked in the food service
in the school cafeteria...

15:09.012 --> 15:11.606
...Ernest O'Roark.
He was telling me on the way down...

15:11.715 --> 15:15.879
...about this section of Birmingham
called Dynamite Hill.

15:15.952 --> 15:17.783
I said, "Why is it called Dynamite Hill?"

15:17.854 --> 15:19.879
He said, "It used to be a garbage dump.

15:19.956 --> 15:23.392
"They cleared the land, fixed it up,
and black people built homes there.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.121
"They were nice homes...

15:25.328 --> 15:28.161
"... and the honkies bomb them because...

15:28.231 --> 15:30.722
"... they resent black folks
having good homes. "

15:31.034 --> 15:33.798
We arrived in Birmingham
about 4:00 in the afternoon.

15:33.870 --> 15:36.737
At 5:30 a bomb went off on Dynamite Hill.

15:37.841 --> 15:40.605
Now that's 1949,
and now you're going to fast forward...

15:40.677 --> 15:43.168
...to 1962.

15:43.313 --> 15:45.144
<i>We're here at Bethel Baptist Church...</i>

15:45.248 --> 15:49.947
<i>...the church which served
as the headquarters for the movement...</i>

15:50.353 --> 15:54.414
<i>...for change in Birmingham, Alabama,
back in the '50s and the '60s.</i>

15:55.158 --> 16:00.118
<i>I'm standing at the corner of the church
where the house was at that time.</i>

16:00.296 --> 16:02.856
<i>Would you care to tell us
about the two bombings?</i>

16:02.932 --> 16:05.833
<i>The first bombing was in...</i>

16:05.902 --> 16:08.666
<i>...December, 1956. Christmas night...</i>

16:09.272 --> 16:12.730
<i>...when somebody planted
12 sticks of dynamite.</i>

16:12.942 --> 16:17.003
The dynamite was placed right here
at the corner of the church.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.945
It would've been the corner of the house.

16:19.049 --> 16:21.825
<i>That's where the head of my bed was,
and I was in the bed.</i>

16:22.059 --> 16:26.325
You can see the cracks in the wall, but
the implosive effects went into the house.

16:26.430 --> 16:30.890
<i>It blew the wall that was between my head
and the dynamite away.</i>

16:31.502 --> 16:33.470
The lights went out...

16:34.037 --> 16:38.303
...and I felt the head of my bed
being driven down.

16:39.476 --> 16:43.469
And yet, I was not afraid.
I knew I wouldn't get killed.

16:44.715 --> 16:46.683
I knew there was a presence there.

16:46.817 --> 16:50.048
<i>At that time,
there was a lot of bombing going on.</i>

16:50.888 --> 16:52.753
<i>Even up where I lived.</i>

16:53.357 --> 16:57.054
<i>They started up on the hill,
up on Green Springs, at that time.</i>

16:58.028 --> 17:00.792
<i>There was only about 11 houses
and only about...</i>

17:00.898 --> 17:03.025
We were the first black family up there.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.361
They would drive by.

17:05.469 --> 17:09.929
In fact, they threw a fire bomb
into our yard, between the houses.

17:10.107 --> 17:11.665
When the problems came...

17:11.742 --> 17:15.371
...we all had to just run in our closets...

17:15.479 --> 17:17.674
...when we would hear the bombs
and so forth.

17:17.748 --> 17:20.717
But it was just a common thing
that was happening.

17:20.917 --> 17:24.911
You could be sitting comfortable
and the dynamite would go off.

17:25.189 --> 17:27.316
<i>One of the interesting parts of that night...</i>

17:27.424 --> 17:30.154
<i>...and that's a dramatic situation...</i>

17:30.260 --> 17:33.388
<i>...the house was leaning
and you couldn't get out.</i>

17:33.463 --> 17:34.930
<i>A crowd instantaneously...</i>

17:34.998 --> 17:38.490
This street was filled
within two or three minutes.

17:39.069 --> 17:42.630
A big burly policeman came back.

17:42.873 --> 17:45.341
This policeman decided
to give me some advice.

17:45.509 --> 17:48.342
Incidentally, he was a Klansman...

17:48.512 --> 17:53.142
...because, we think at that time,
about a third of Birmingham policemen...

17:53.217 --> 17:55.014
...either were Klansman...

17:55.085 --> 17:56.780
...or had Klan affiliation.

17:56.920 --> 18:01.289
He said, "I really didn't believe
that they would go this far. "

18:02.693 --> 18:06.629
He said, "Reverend, I'll tell you
what I'd do, if I were you.

18:06.697 --> 18:09.222
"I'd get out of town as quick as I could. "

18:09.733 --> 18:11.826
I said, "Officer, you're not me.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.503
"You go back and tell your Klan brethren...

18:14.571 --> 18:17.096
"... that if God could keep me through this...

18:17.774 --> 18:20.265
"... that the war zone,
the battle has just begun...

18:20.510 --> 18:22.410
"... and I'll be around for the duration. "

18:22.512 --> 18:26.209
We'll make like this is back in the '60s.

18:27.351 --> 18:30.650
<i>- How old were you back then?
- At the time, I was 14.</i>

18:30.888 --> 18:32.321
You were the same age as Cynthia.

18:32.422 --> 18:33.411
The same age.

18:33.523 --> 18:37.721
This is the house she was brought up in,
right here.

18:38.362 --> 18:40.523
We would play all out here.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.061
She would have little lawn parties.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.264
She was well liked.

18:49.206 --> 18:52.664
We had no idea of the tragedy
that was going to happen, but...

18:54.344 --> 18:56.039
...she lived a normal life.

18:56.914 --> 18:58.472
<i>Cynthia was...</i>

18:58.548 --> 19:01.073
<i>This is 30-some years ago, but...</i>

19:01.285 --> 19:02.217
Images.

19:02.319 --> 19:04.310
Cynthia could have humor.

19:04.421 --> 19:08.255
I remember laughing with Cynthia.
You could have jokes.

19:08.325 --> 19:09.724
I remember that well.

19:09.826 --> 19:11.885
She was caring. Some people aren't.

19:11.962 --> 19:12.951
I was younger.

19:13.030 --> 19:14.691
<i>I was a fat little young boy.</i>

19:14.765 --> 19:18.223
<i>Some people didn't want to be bothered
with me. Cynthia would.</i>

19:18.335 --> 19:19.893
She would, she'd take time...

19:19.970 --> 19:22.131
...and just be nice to me as a human being.

19:22.205 --> 19:23.695
<i>Cynthia Wesley...</i>

19:26.176 --> 19:29.634
<i>...was the daughter of Claude...</i>

19:29.846 --> 19:31.746
<i>...Mr. and Mrs. Claude Wesley.</i>

19:32.215 --> 19:34.308
<i>He was principal...</i>

19:34.384 --> 19:36.614
...of Lewis School at that time.

19:36.820 --> 19:39.050
<i>Cynthia was a delightful young lady.</i>

19:39.122 --> 19:42.956
<i>The Wesleys adopted Cynthia
when she was quite young...</i>

19:43.760 --> 19:46.888
...and she grew up in 16th Street Church
with them.

19:46.997 --> 19:50.125
Cynthia was very involved in church.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.896
She was in the choir, and in fact...

19:53.737 --> 19:56.262
...the Sunday of the bombing,
on September 15...

19:56.340 --> 19:59.104
...Cynthia would have begun her first...

20:00.978 --> 20:03.742
...opportunity as an usher, on that Sunday.

20:03.947 --> 20:06.848
<i>I was probably closest to Cynthia Wesley.</i>

20:06.984 --> 20:09.214
We were in a little club together.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.682
In this club we had little outfits
that matched, and hats.

20:14.958 --> 20:17.392
We had just ordered
some new stuff to wear.

20:17.527 --> 20:20.519
In fact, after she was killed,
we took what she had ordered...

20:20.597 --> 20:22.690
...to her mom's house, and talked to her.

20:22.833 --> 20:25.631
On the Sunday morning, the 15th...

20:26.103 --> 20:29.504
...when Cynthia and the other girls
came to Sunday school...

20:30.474 --> 20:32.840
...I remember my mother telling me...

20:32.909 --> 20:35.309
...how she had chided Cynthia...

20:35.379 --> 20:37.438
...because, as she came out of the house...

20:37.581 --> 20:40.243
...she noticed that her slip was hanging.

20:40.484 --> 20:43.112
My mother told her to go back in the room.

20:43.787 --> 20:46.312
What I'd like to do
is read a statement about that...

20:46.390 --> 20:48.984
...because the way my mother
presented this to her...

20:49.059 --> 20:52.927
...is something pretty typical
that mothers would say to their daughters.

20:52.996 --> 20:55.590
My mother stated that:

20:55.966 --> 20:58.901
"Young lady,
your slip is hanging below your dress.

20:59.503 --> 21:02.836
"You just don't put your clothes on
any way when you go to church...

21:02.906 --> 21:05.534
"... because you never know
how you're coming back.

21:06.410 --> 21:08.742
"Cynthia hurriedly made
the necessary adjustments...

21:08.812 --> 21:10.404
"... then ran out of the door. "

21:11.281 --> 21:13.579
My mother never saw her after that.

21:18.321 --> 21:19.447
I'm sorry.

21:26.463 --> 21:28.158
<i>My mother said...</i>

21:33.070 --> 21:35.766
I didn't think I'd do this. I'm sorry.

21:48.452 --> 21:51.182
<i>In 1961...</i>

21:51.922 --> 21:54.652
<i>...the Freedom Riders came to Birmingham.</i>

21:57.327 --> 22:00.319
<i>One of their buses was burned in Aniston.</i>

22:00.397 --> 22:02.957
<i>They had one bus left
and they all came on that bus...</i>

22:03.066 --> 22:04.158
<i>...to Birmingham.</i>

22:07.370 --> 22:09.565
They went to the Trailways bus station.

22:09.706 --> 22:13.369
National television was waiting for them
at the Greyhound bus station.

22:14.177 --> 22:16.042
<i>They didn't just beat Freedom Riders.</i>

22:16.113 --> 22:18.946
<i>There were people who'd just come
to beat the bus.</i>

22:19.082 --> 22:20.242
But one photographer...

22:20.317 --> 22:24.219
<i>...was at the station
and took a picture of the beating.</i>

22:24.621 --> 22:26.350
<i>They turned on him...</i>

22:26.423 --> 22:28.948
<i>...and beat him, and took his camera away.</i>

22:29.960 --> 22:32.861
And being very scientific...

22:32.996 --> 22:36.989
...they broke the lens
and threw the camera in the trash can...

22:37.334 --> 22:39.859
...but never opened it and exposed the film.

22:40.370 --> 22:44.636
So that picture went out of here
on the UPI wire.

22:45.108 --> 22:49.408
<i>It was front-page in newspapers
all over the world.</i>

22:49.713 --> 22:52.739
<i>A group of Birmingham businessmen
were in Tokyo at the time...</i>

22:52.816 --> 22:54.078
<i>...at a meeting...</i>

22:54.151 --> 22:56.483
...of the International Rotary Club.

22:57.888 --> 23:01.051
When they saw that picture
on the front page...

23:01.558 --> 23:05.119
...of a newspaper in Tokyo, Japan...

23:05.195 --> 23:07.959
...they said:
"We can't take much more of this. "

23:08.198 --> 23:09.495
Birmingham...

23:11.801 --> 23:13.860
...at the time, was going through...

23:15.105 --> 23:16.868
...a move where...

23:18.575 --> 23:23.069
...some of the moderate forces
in the white community...

23:23.146 --> 23:26.741
...were trying to finally assert themselves.

23:27.918 --> 23:29.909
And it was a long time overdue.

23:30.020 --> 23:32.284
<i>A state court is expected
to rule next week...</i>

23:32.355 --> 23:35.882
<i>...on whether mayor-elect, Albert Boutwell,
can take office immediately.</i>

23:36.059 --> 23:39.119
<i>Boutwell was asked if he's ready
to meet with Negro leaders.</i>

23:39.829 --> 23:41.456
<i>"I'm ready at any time...</i>

23:42.332 --> 23:45.495
<i>"... when the immediate threat of violence...</i>

23:45.569 --> 23:47.662
<i>"... has been removed...</i>

23:47.904 --> 23:52.068
<i>"... to talk to any responsible local people...</i>

23:53.043 --> 23:56.376
<i>"... regardless of the color of their skins. "</i>

23:56.713 --> 23:58.408
<i>Birmingham is a symbol...</i>

23:58.481 --> 24:02.178
<i>...of hardcore resistance to integration.</i>

24:02.552 --> 24:06.454
<i>It is probably
the most thoroughly segregated city...</i>

24:06.523 --> 24:08.714
<i>...in the United States.</i>

24:10.049 --> 24:12.415
SCLC had been really
just organized in 1957.

24:12.551 --> 24:16.885
About a hundred preachers
got together in Louisiana.

24:19.492 --> 24:22.427
We hadn't had much luck.
We didn't have much staff.

24:22.495 --> 24:25.953
<i>Fred Shuttlesworth came to see
Martin Luther King and said;</i>

24:26.065 --> 24:27.259
<i>"Martin, you've got to...</i>

24:27.333 --> 24:30.700
"... help us in Birmingham.
We just got to move on Birmingham. "

24:30.903 --> 24:33.201
<i>The federal government has decided...</i>

24:34.273 --> 24:37.731
<i>...that Negroes as citizens
must be protected from lawlessness...</i>

24:37.877 --> 24:39.367
<i>...and mobocracy.</i>

24:40.246 --> 24:42.043
<i>And that's why we're here.</i>

24:42.748 --> 24:45.182
<i>Fred Shuttlesworth had been fighting
in Birmingham...</i>

24:45.251 --> 24:47.481
<i>...for ten years, by this time.</i>

24:47.687 --> 24:51.646
<i>The Alabama organization
was almost his personal creation...</i>

24:51.724 --> 24:52.884
...in Birmingham...

24:52.958 --> 24:56.325
...in the same sense that SCLC
was a personal creation for Dr. King.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.629
<i>In the fall of 1962...</i>

24:58.698 --> 25:01.189
<i>...almost six months
before the breakthrough in May...</i>

25:01.267 --> 25:03.565
<i>...and a year before
the Birmingham church bombing...</i>

25:03.636 --> 25:05.763
<i>...Shuttlesworth had had an agreement...</i>

25:05.838 --> 25:09.467
<i>...after lots of boycotts in Birmingham
with the merchants...</i>

25:09.542 --> 25:12.010
<i>...for what we would now regard as...</i>

25:12.078 --> 25:14.603
<i>...the most minimum token segregation...</i>

25:14.680 --> 25:17.706
<i>...of allowing black shoppers,
mostly women...</i>

25:17.850 --> 25:22.446
<i>...to shop and use the restrooms
and changing rooms in downtown stores.</i>

25:22.655 --> 25:24.145
<i>He'd made these agreements...</i>

25:24.223 --> 25:27.317
<i>...and then they re-segregated everything
in the fall of 1962.</i>

25:27.693 --> 25:32.221
I think by then his patience ran out
and he said:

25:33.332 --> 25:36.859
"Bravery alone is not enough.
We need to bring in a larger spotlight. "

25:36.936 --> 25:40.667
To him, bringing a larger spotlight
meant bringing in Dr. King.

25:41.407 --> 25:44.035
We made a decision
based on several things.

25:44.110 --> 25:47.602
Fred Shuttlesworth
was fearless and courageous...

25:47.680 --> 25:49.705
...to the point of being almost insane.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.484
<i>He miraculously survived a bombing
of his home...</i>

25:53.753 --> 25:57.086
<i>...had taken his wife and two children
trying to integrate a school...</i>

25:57.156 --> 26:01.217
<i>...with a mob of 500 or 600 folks
with chains and stuff.</i>

26:01.293 --> 26:03.784
<i>Just an incredible human being in my view.</i>

26:03.863 --> 26:07.993
<i>One day in 1957, in the afternoon,
on the evening newscast...</i>

26:08.134 --> 26:11.297
<i>...there was a piece of film
of a gang of white men...</i>

26:11.370 --> 26:13.565
<i>...beating Fred Shuttlesworth...</i>

26:14.607 --> 26:18.839
<i>...in the street, outside Phillips High School
where he'd taken his children.</i>

26:19.145 --> 26:21.375
<i>With chains, they beat him to the ground.</i>

26:22.448 --> 26:25.781
The reason it was riveting for me,
I was 14 years old...

26:27.186 --> 26:31.816
...was that the police said
they couldn't find the men who did it.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.383
And I recognized one of the men.
I knew who he was.

26:36.462 --> 26:38.862
I'd seen him at Jack Cash's Barbecue...

26:38.964 --> 26:42.127
...and I knew the police hung out
at Jack Cash's Barbecue...

26:42.201 --> 26:43.759
...and I knew they were Iying.

26:44.503 --> 26:48.269
<i>It was the last place,
I think, I wanted to go...</i>

26:48.641 --> 26:51.201
<i>...with Martin Luther King in 1963.</i>

26:51.877 --> 26:54.402
And yet, it was the place we had to go.

26:56.782 --> 27:00.775
<i>Addie Mae Collins was
a little more withdrawn, I think.</i>

27:01.287 --> 27:03.915
Friendly, but not as aggressive...

27:03.989 --> 27:07.322
...as Cynthia or Denise.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.458
<i>To know Addie is to love Addie.</i>

27:10.563 --> 27:12.997
She was just a funny girI...

27:13.399 --> 27:15.867
...a sweet peacefuI girI.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.869
She just liked to make peace with people...

27:18.938 --> 27:21.634
...and people to be at peace around.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.534
She wasn't a mean person,
she was just sweet.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.305
Remember with Denise...

27:26.378 --> 27:28.539
...when the bird died,
it was the weirdest thing?

27:28.614 --> 27:31.742
I have to tell you the bird story.
We saw a dead bird.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.910
We thought, "It's just a dead bird,
kick it out of the way. "

27:34.987 --> 27:38.684
Denise said, "Oh no,
the bird must have a funeral."

27:38.757 --> 27:43.057
We were like,
"Just put it somewhere so we can play. "

27:43.128 --> 27:46.962
She said, "No, we've got to have a funeral
for the poor bird. "

27:47.032 --> 27:50.331
<i>She got her mother,
and Mrs. McNair has a beautifuI voice...</i>

27:50.402 --> 27:54.395
She got her mother, she got the shoebox.
The boys had to dig a hole.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.504
And we buried the bird.

27:56.575 --> 28:00.272
Mrs. McNair sang the Lord's Prayer,
and it was beautifuI.

28:00.346 --> 28:04.510
<i>Then we all bowed and we prayed,
and said something...</i>

28:05.284 --> 28:06.546
Then, "Let's play ball. "

28:07.286 --> 28:11.814
<i>The first Sunday that we marched,
Palm Sunday, I think it was...</i>

28:12.725 --> 28:15.216
<i>No, it wasn't Palm Sunday,
it was a Sunday...</i>

28:15.294 --> 28:19.731
<i>And the church services of the pastor's,
the afternoon service, ran a little late.</i>

28:20.666 --> 28:23.726
<i>We were supposed to march at 4;00.
It was about 6;30.</i>

28:24.036 --> 28:27.836
By the time we got ready to march,
there was about 1,200 people out there...

28:27.940 --> 28:31.501
...milling around Ingram Park,
waiting to see something happen.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.145
<i>And Bull's folks out there with the dogs.</i>

28:36.248 --> 28:40.514
<i>Before you knew it, something was
going on between the police with the dogs.</i>

28:41.120 --> 28:43.588
The next day, the UPI said:

28:43.722 --> 28:46.953
"Eleven hundred march in Birmingham,
15 arrested. "

28:47.059 --> 28:49.289
I called Doctor. I said, "Dr. King, I got it. "

28:49.361 --> 28:50.692
He said, "What is it?"

28:50.763 --> 28:53.755
I said, "We're just going to slow down
the time of the march...

28:53.832 --> 28:56.096
"... until the people get home
from work every day.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.328
"We'll get a crowd.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.997
"We can count on Bull
to do something silly. "

29:01.774 --> 29:03.503
<i>If there's anybody in this nation...</i>

29:03.575 --> 29:06.601
<i>...who understands
what's going on here, it is me.</i>

29:06.812 --> 29:09.372
<i>I know that we have sufficient manpower...</i>

29:09.448 --> 29:12.611
<i>...enough trained officers
to keep the peace in Birmingham...</i>

29:12.685 --> 29:16.052
<i>...without any outside help
from the federal government.</i>

29:16.455 --> 29:18.013
<i>Eugene "Bull" O'Connor...</i>

29:19.191 --> 29:21.955
...was the police commissioner.

29:22.027 --> 29:24.791
Commissioner of fire and safety.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.123
It's ironic that safety would be...

29:28.200 --> 29:30.930
...in the hands of a man
who was so unsafe.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.630
He kept people so insecure.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.396
<i>He was about as hardcore as they come.</i>

29:36.508 --> 29:40.672
He was one of those people
that drew the line and never retreated.

29:41.080 --> 29:45.676
I don't think he felt
that blacks had any rights.

29:45.751 --> 29:48.083
I don't think he felt
they should be citizens even.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.280
I used to wonder if he was a Christian.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.323
They say he was,
but I don't believe he was.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.188
I don't think anybody
could do any race of people...

29:55.294 --> 29:57.626
...the many things that they did
to black people.

29:57.696 --> 30:01.223
<i>Bull O'Connor liked
to keep black folk in their place.</i>

30:02.001 --> 30:05.937
<i>All of the arrests and
all the demonstrations in Birmingham...</i>

30:06.338 --> 30:08.238
<i>...occurred within...</i>

30:08.474 --> 30:11.204
...four blocks of 16th Street Baptist Church.

30:11.744 --> 30:15.236
We'd meet in the church,
we'd march a few blocks...

30:15.314 --> 30:16.975
...then he'd lock everybody up.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.675
<i>When there were too many people
to lock up...</i>

30:20.753 --> 30:23.779
<i>...he'd call on the dogs and the fire hoses...</i>

30:23.856 --> 30:27.053
<i>...and try to clear the street by force.</i>

30:27.326 --> 30:29.157
When he saw any strength...

30:29.528 --> 30:33.055
...or self-respect in a black person,
he just went crazy.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.223
He couldn't stand it.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.064
It's like, "When you see me,
you gotta squat. "

30:38.137 --> 30:42.369
So, if you don't become ingratiating...

30:42.674 --> 30:44.107
...he'd just go crazy.

30:44.176 --> 30:48.272
<i>He had a white tank that he would ride
through the black neighborhoods...</i>

30:48.380 --> 30:52.510
<i>...and terrorize people in the neighborhood
in his white tank.</i>

30:52.584 --> 30:56.111
<i>There was almost no way to talk
to him or reason with him.</i>

30:56.355 --> 30:57.481
It was his town.

30:57.556 --> 31:02.084
It was almost like the old West,
where he was one-man rule.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.694
<i>Bull Connor indeed did spit on me.
Yes, he did.</i>

31:04.763 --> 31:07.129
Whether he was just upset
in talking and it came...

31:07.199 --> 31:09.633
...or on purpose,
I don't know, but he was hating me.

31:09.701 --> 31:13.000
<i>What happened was,
we went through the training session.</i>

31:13.072 --> 31:16.371
<i>They took us by the Baptist Church
and we left from that area.</i>

31:16.475 --> 31:19.308
<i>We were able to march.
We marched right up to City Hall.</i>

31:19.711 --> 31:24.307
<i>There was this white man,
red-faced man, looking mean.</i>

31:25.317 --> 31:27.911
His name was indeed Bull Connor.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.421
Whether he said "nigger" or "nigra"
I'm not even sure...

31:31.490 --> 31:34.982
...but he looked down at me and said,
"What do you want, little nigger?"

31:35.060 --> 31:37.392
<i>I said, "We want our freedom,
we want to pray. "</i>

31:37.496 --> 31:41.899
<i>As soon as I said that, intentionally or not,
he spat on me. I remember that well.</i>

31:41.967 --> 31:44.231
Bull was the manifestation...

31:45.838 --> 31:47.601
...of the perversity...

31:48.574 --> 31:51.475
...upon which segregation
depended for its life.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.036
<i>He was...</i>

31:56.348 --> 31:59.317
Bull was like the walking id
of Birmingham...

31:59.418 --> 32:01.648
...the dark spirit of Birmingham...

32:01.920 --> 32:04.912
...the hellish side of Birmingham
made embodied.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.083
It sounds dramatic,
but it was a dramatic time.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.290
He didn't have but one eye.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.420
He was a Sunday school teacher.

32:11.864 --> 32:15.391
Had a kind of wiry, raspy voice...

32:15.501 --> 32:17.526
...which was kind of coarse.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.634
He was not a large man
but he had a lot of power.

32:23.208 --> 32:26.302
Most of the white people were afraid
of him, most all Negroes.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.608
I guess I didn't have sense enough
to be afraid.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.639
I used to be afraid of Bull
until I discovered he was crazy.

32:32.885 --> 32:36.515
When I discovered he was crazy,
my whole attitude changed.

32:36.816 --> 32:40.308
<i>Al Hibler was at the Trailways bus depot,
on the corner.</i>

32:40.886 --> 32:44.049
<i>All of them put us in jail
and put us in the paddy wagon.</i>

32:44.190 --> 32:46.784
<i>Al Hibler was standing
beside the building like that...</i>

32:46.859 --> 32:48.224
<i>...and Bull looked and said;</i>

32:48.294 --> 32:51.889
<i>"HeyI Go on and get that blind nigger
and bring him over herel"</i>

32:53.732 --> 32:56.530
See how funny this insane man was?

32:56.735 --> 33:00.364
He's hollering across the street,
"Bring that blind nigger over here!"

33:00.706 --> 33:02.469
Now here's a blind man.

33:02.808 --> 33:04.537
He doesn't understand human nature...

33:04.610 --> 33:07.511
...enough to relate even to a blind man.
Bull was like that.

33:08.147 --> 33:10.877
<i>You wonder what makes
people like that tick.</i>

33:11.951 --> 33:15.614
What's going on inside their mind...

33:15.688 --> 33:18.179
...the brain, the head, if they have a brain...

33:18.657 --> 33:22.115
...that makes them hate folk...

33:22.194 --> 33:26.688
...want to do evil, the way that they did.

33:26.799 --> 33:29.962
You just wonder,
"What are they thinking about?"

33:30.069 --> 33:34.005
You must understand
that a Bull O'Connor couldn't exist...

33:34.273 --> 33:38.141
...without the nods
from the status quo people.

33:38.244 --> 33:40.678
The big boys in any town.

33:40.746 --> 33:43.180
No Bull O'Connor can exist without them.

33:43.315 --> 33:47.115
He may be the person
who actually does the talking...

33:47.286 --> 33:51.222
...but, believe me, the Bull O'Connors
have the blessing of somebody else.

33:51.357 --> 33:53.723
<i>In the name of the greatest people...</i>

33:53.792 --> 33:56.192
<i>...that have ever trod this earth...</i>

33:56.495 --> 33:58.929
<i>...I draw the line in the dust...</i>

33:58.998 --> 34:01.990
<i>...and toss the gauntlet
before the feet of tyranny...</i>

34:02.101 --> 34:04.797
<i>...and I say segregation now...</i>

34:04.904 --> 34:09.068
<i>...segregation tomorrow,
and segregation foreverI</i>

34:11.810 --> 34:15.576
I think George Wallace was the cause
of many people's death.

34:15.648 --> 34:17.114
Certainly much suffering.

34:17.181 --> 34:20.413
<i>The whites of Birmingham should've
been commended by the President...</i>

34:20.485 --> 34:22.750
<i>...for their restraint
during the demonstrations.</i>

34:22.821 --> 34:25.755
<i>White people have not been involved,
only lawless Negroes.</i>

34:25.824 --> 34:29.554
George Wallace was
a dynamic expression...

34:29.695 --> 34:32.219
...of the mentally deranged white people.

34:33.532 --> 34:36.000
<i>People who are afraid of change...</i>

34:36.101 --> 34:40.367
<i>...and frustration, George Wallace
expressed that mental illness.</i>

34:40.539 --> 34:42.335
<i>He's dynamic. Best in the business.</i>

34:42.440 --> 34:44.841
<i>"Now therefore, I, George C. Wallace...</i>

34:45.110 --> 34:49.739
<i>"... as Governor of the State of Alabama,
have, by my action, raised issues...</i>

34:49.815 --> 34:54.013
<i>"... between the central government
and the sovereign State of Alabama...</i>

34:54.186 --> 34:56.654
<i>"... which said issues
should be adjudicated...</i>

34:56.722 --> 35:00.249
<i>"... in the manner prescribed
by the Constitution of the United States...</i>

35:00.359 --> 35:02.987
<i>"... and being mindful of my duties
and responsibilities...</i>

35:03.062 --> 35:05.360
<i>"... under the Constitution
of the United States...</i>

35:05.431 --> 35:07.524
<i>"... the Constitution
of the State of Alabama...</i>

35:07.600 --> 35:11.832
<i>"... and seeking to preserve and maintain
the peace and dignity of this state...</i>

35:12.037 --> 35:14.904
<i>"... and the individual freedoms
of the citizens thereof...</i>

35:14.974 --> 35:17.875
<i>"... do hereby denounce and forbid... "</i>

35:42.368 --> 35:43.562
<i>Governor Wallace...</i>

35:44.169 --> 35:49.106
<i>...I take it from that statement
that you are going to stand in that door...</i>

35:49.308 --> 35:53.472
<i>...and that you are not going to
carry out the orders of this court...</i>

35:53.712 --> 35:55.873
<i>...and that you will resist us from doing so.</i>

35:55.948 --> 35:59.315
<i>- Is that correct?
- I stand upon that statement.</i>

36:00.052 --> 36:03.112
<i>The day in which Governor Wallace
stood in the door was...</i>

36:03.222 --> 36:07.283
...a really hot Alabama summer day.

36:10.329 --> 36:12.388
Going down before we got there...

36:12.464 --> 36:15.490
...I had been interrupted
and had a call from Bobby...

36:16.402 --> 36:19.769
...who said the President wants you
to make him look silly.

36:20.205 --> 36:21.604
I said, "How do you do that?"

36:21.674 --> 36:24.609
He said, "I don't know,
but you figure it out. "

36:25.044 --> 36:26.602
So I was nervous about that...

36:26.679 --> 36:30.308
...and I was hot and irritated
at the whole show...

36:30.382 --> 36:32.680
...at the hundreds of newsmen
and cameras.

36:33.285 --> 36:35.150
All of this for something...

36:35.854 --> 36:38.789
...that I thought
was just plain wrong and silly.

36:39.224 --> 36:41.419
A silly point that he was trying to make.

37:02.147 --> 37:04.012
<i>George Wallace was George Wallace.</i>

37:04.183 --> 37:06.981
<i>He's seeking redemption now,
I understand.</i>

37:07.753 --> 37:09.618
<i>Sometimes I wonder...</i>

37:09.722 --> 37:13.453
<i>...if he believed in all of those things
he did himself...</i>

37:13.892 --> 37:16.690
<i>...or if he was doing it because it was...</i>

37:17.029 --> 37:19.998
...expedient to do as a politician.

37:45.424 --> 37:48.860
<i>George Wallace, when he was
an elected person in office...</i>

37:49.194 --> 37:51.662
...was very much like...

37:51.730 --> 37:54.198
<i>...a situation in a story I had in The Reader.</i>

37:54.633 --> 37:57.602
<i>In The Reader, the horse...</i>

37:58.771 --> 38:02.400
...used to be a fire horse,
and he was sold to a milk company.

38:04.143 --> 38:06.543
When he was sold to the milk company...

38:06.612 --> 38:08.739
...one day the milkman
stopped at a house...

38:08.814 --> 38:11.874
...and was going up
to set a bottle of milk down...

38:11.950 --> 38:13.918
...and the fire whistle blew.

38:14.019 --> 38:16.852
When the whistle blew,
the horse took off with the wagon...

38:16.955 --> 38:18.217
...and broke all the milk.

38:18.323 --> 38:20.723
<i>George Wallace was that type of person.</i>

38:20.926 --> 38:22.587
<i>As long as he was sitting down...</i>

38:22.661 --> 38:26.688
...talking to you one on one,
nicest guy you ever want to sit down with.

38:26.832 --> 38:30.324
But when the cameras came
and got on him in the political arena...

38:30.402 --> 38:34.361
...he turned into that fire horse
and broke every bottle of milk on the truck.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.270
Ed, come over here, just one minute.

38:41.914 --> 38:44.747
Here's one of my best friends, right here.

38:45.217 --> 38:47.082
My best friend, right here.

38:47.452 --> 38:51.388
I wouldn't go anywhere without him.
All over the world with me.

39:02.401 --> 39:05.131
<i>Would you stand for our opening hymn,
Hymn 350...</i>

39:05.204 --> 39:07.968
...The Church is One Foundation.

40:03.328 --> 40:05.694
One of the things you have to have...

40:05.764 --> 40:08.824
...in a movement is a meeting place.

40:09.368 --> 40:13.805
Rev. John Cross and the people
of 16th Street Baptist Church...

40:14.039 --> 40:16.704
...literally made their church
the headquarters.

40:16.838 --> 40:18.567
It was a movement church by logistics...

40:18.673 --> 40:22.302
...as it was right across the street
from Kelly Ingram Park...

40:22.744 --> 40:24.575
...which was the gathering ground...

40:24.646 --> 40:28.514
...and almost catecorner
from the Gas & Motel...

40:28.583 --> 40:30.676
...where the movement people
headquartered.

40:30.752 --> 40:32.982
It was very convenient, close to downtown.

40:33.054 --> 40:37.252
You could gather in the 16th Street Church
and march downtown from there.

40:37.358 --> 40:39.451
I was 12 years old...

40:39.961 --> 40:43.897
...when the marching began...

40:43.965 --> 40:45.796
...when Dr. King was there...

40:45.867 --> 40:49.564
...and Rev. Young and Rev. Bevel...

40:49.704 --> 40:51.729
...and Rev. Abernathy.

40:51.806 --> 40:55.765
First of all, I was very impressed
by how articulate they were.

40:55.910 --> 40:57.741
They'd walk into the audience and tell us:

40:57.812 --> 41:01.248
"If you've got anything in your pocket,
even a nail file, let's have it.

41:01.315 --> 41:04.045
"We don't want anybody
to think or be able to say...

41:04.118 --> 41:07.212
"... we're here for any purpose
other than what we're here for...

41:07.288 --> 41:10.883
"... which is a serious march
to try to regain our rights. "

41:11.025 --> 41:13.721
You can't imagine how it really was.

41:14.929 --> 41:18.057
There were some good days
and there were some bad days.

41:18.132 --> 41:20.498
- We've come a long way.
- I remember the good days...

41:20.568 --> 41:22.695
...because I used to love
the freedom songs.

41:22.804 --> 41:24.101
<i>And my favorite was;</i>

41:24.172 --> 41:27.938
<i>"All bound in jail</i>

41:28.142 --> 41:31.578
<i>"Had nobody to go their bail</i>

41:32.180 --> 41:36.082
<i>"Keep your eyes on the prize</i>

41:36.250 --> 41:40.118
<i>"Hold on, my Lordy, hold on</i>

41:40.188 --> 41:43.624
<i>"The only thing that we did wrong</i>

41:44.058 --> 41:47.926
<i>"We stayed in the wilderness
a day too long</i>

41:48.262 --> 41:52.130
<i>"Keep your eyes on the prize</i>

41:52.200 --> 41:55.465
<i>"Hold on, my Lordy, hold on</i>

41:56.304 --> 41:59.296
<i>"Hold on</i>

42:00.141 --> 42:03.076
<i>"Hold on</i>

42:03.277 --> 42:07.236
<i>"Keep your eyes on the prize</i>

42:07.548 --> 42:11.279
<i>"Hold on, my Lordy, hold on"</i>

42:11.786 --> 42:14.414
<i>Negotiations are unproductive.</i>

42:14.756 --> 42:18.988
<i>We have no alternative
but to demonstrate.</i>

42:19.193 --> 42:21.320
<i>In a meeting today, we discussed...</i>

42:21.395 --> 42:24.228
<i>...all of these issues, and we all agree...</i>

42:24.332 --> 42:28.098
<i>...that if the present negotiations...</i>

42:28.402 --> 42:30.461
<i>...that are taking place...</i>

42:30.605 --> 42:32.470
<i>...are not productive...</i>

42:32.540 --> 42:34.098
<i>...we will have no alternative...</i>

42:34.175 --> 42:37.474
<i>...but to call for the new demonstrations...</i>

42:37.545 --> 42:39.274
<i>...here in Birmingham, Alabama.</i>

42:39.347 --> 42:40.609
<i>The movement was failing.</i>

42:41.616 --> 42:45.017
Nobody was even asking questions
at press conferences in Washington...

42:45.086 --> 42:46.644
...about Birmingham...

42:46.721 --> 42:51.158
...after two months
of active demonstrations.

42:51.259 --> 42:54.387
The first demonstrations we had
were just a handfuI of people.

42:54.796 --> 42:57.162
<i>In fact, when Dr. King himself went to jail...</i>

42:57.231 --> 42:59.597
<i>...only 55 people would go with him.</i>

42:59.734 --> 43:02.635
<i>So, when young people today ask me;</i>

43:02.703 --> 43:06.799
<i>"When are we going to be able to
get together like you all were in the '60s?"</i>

43:06.874 --> 43:08.899
<i>Nobody was together in the '60s.</i>

43:09.143 --> 43:11.873
<i>It was a small group of dedicated people...</i>

43:12.647 --> 43:13.807
...who got it started.

43:14.048 --> 43:15.538
Then the kids took it over.

43:15.950 --> 43:17.508
In 1963...

43:18.152 --> 43:22.213
...I was directing the movement
in Mississippi.

43:23.658 --> 43:26.320
The Southern Christian
Leadership Conference in Greenwood.

43:26.727 --> 43:29.560
<i>Dr. King, Abernathy
and Shuttlesworth and these guys...</i>

43:29.664 --> 43:33.293
...were trying to get adults,
and they'd gotten about as many adults...

43:33.401 --> 43:35.995
<i>...so he called me on the phone
and asked me...</i>

43:36.070 --> 43:40.200
<i>...would I come to Birmingham
and help to organize the people...</i>

43:40.308 --> 43:41.741
...the young people.

43:41.809 --> 43:44.175
So I went to Birmingham...

43:44.278 --> 43:46.473
<i>...to help organize the people...</i>

43:46.547 --> 43:48.981
<i>...and involve the young people
in the movement.</i>

43:49.050 --> 43:52.110
James Bevel, principally...

43:53.287 --> 43:57.883
...and Andy Young and Dorothy Cotten,
were given the task...

43:58.192 --> 44:02.288
...to get the college students of Miles
and another junior college there.

44:02.530 --> 44:06.398
<i>Bevel, sort of on his own,
went down to Parker High School.</i>

44:06.601 --> 44:10.230
And the teachers told us
they couldn't go and get in the movement.

44:10.504 --> 44:14.406
They locked the gates. That was it.

44:15.076 --> 44:17.943
They locked the gates,
but the kids climbed them...

44:18.012 --> 44:19.479
...and got in the movement.

44:19.981 --> 44:23.348
<i>When the high school kids got in,
the junior high school kids...</i>

44:23.417 --> 44:26.318
<i>It was like an avalanche.
Then the little kids wanted to come.</i>

44:26.387 --> 44:28.753
<i>We got word that
the children wanted to march.</i>

44:28.856 --> 44:31.381
<i>My thing was like,
we have two colleges here.</i>

44:31.525 --> 44:33.652
<i>We have Payne, we have Miles College...</i>

44:33.728 --> 44:35.958
<i>...and you got all these 12 high schools.</i>

44:36.030 --> 44:39.261
<i>All these young people are
as big as their moms and dads...</i>

44:39.333 --> 44:43.565
<i>...and they don't have to pay rent,
house notes, car notes.</i>

44:43.738 --> 44:46.104
<i>So if they were involved...</i>

44:46.841 --> 44:48.365
<i>...by the thousands...</i>

44:48.776 --> 44:52.303
...then you'd have the whole
African-American community involved.

44:52.513 --> 44:55.880
<i>I don't know of any precedent in history...</i>

44:56.050 --> 45:00.714
<i>...for using children that young
in a political campaign like this.</i>

45:00.922 --> 45:04.483
<i>There was tremendous,
ferocious opposition...</i>

45:04.558 --> 45:06.082
<i>...to what they decided to do.</i>

45:06.160 --> 45:07.525
<i>As one teacher said...</i>

45:07.995 --> 45:11.396
<i>...she turned her back
to write on the board and said;</i>

45:11.465 --> 45:14.764
<i>"I hope when I turn around
that everyone isn't gone. "</i>

45:15.870 --> 45:18.532
And she turned around,
and they all were gone.

45:18.606 --> 45:21.837
<i>First day, I'll never forget at home...</i>

45:21.909 --> 45:24.070
<i>...turning on the TV news...</i>

45:24.145 --> 45:27.444
<i>...and there were children,
high school kids...</i>

45:27.815 --> 45:29.749
...marching in lines of two.

45:30.217 --> 45:31.912
And it just hit me.

45:32.219 --> 45:35.313
"God," I said, "I've got to go, Mama!"

45:35.589 --> 45:40.219
I could have been surprised
if I had joined up with the SCLC group...

45:41.329 --> 45:42.819
...civil rights group.

45:42.897 --> 45:45.058
But they couldn't find me...

45:45.132 --> 45:47.327
...as they didn't know I'd let my children...

45:47.435 --> 45:49.562
<i>...go out. I had eighth grade.</i>

45:49.637 --> 45:52.470
<i>I had about five or six young boys...</i>

45:52.540 --> 45:55.907
<i>...who every time they would have
a march, they would go.</i>

45:56.243 --> 45:57.835
<i>And I let them go.</i>

45:57.912 --> 46:00.506
<i>Even little ones. You'd say,
"Where have you been?</i>

46:00.581 --> 46:01.707
<i>"I've been to jail.</i>

46:02.049 --> 46:04.108
"What did you go to jail for?

46:04.251 --> 46:06.742
"See, I've been going to jail for freedom. "

46:06.854 --> 46:08.845
<i>It was one of the most...</i>

46:10.458 --> 46:12.858
<i>...frightening experiences of my life.</i>

46:13.494 --> 46:14.893
<i>It was very scary...</i>

46:14.962 --> 46:16.759
<i>...and they put us in this place.</i>

46:16.864 --> 46:21.301
<i>The place was with the inside bedrooms
already taken...</i>

46:21.369 --> 46:23.701
<i>...so we were on the floor for five days...</i>

46:23.771 --> 46:26.171
<i>...right there on the floor, right in the hall.</i>

46:26.340 --> 46:28.740
<i>They purposely put us in...</i>

46:28.809 --> 46:32.711
<i>...with kids who were criminals...</i>

46:33.647 --> 46:35.547
...little boys who were real hard.

46:35.616 --> 46:39.052
I was not real hard.
I was definitely scared.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.951
<i>I want equal rights.</i>

46:41.422 --> 46:43.253
<i>I want equal rights.</i>

46:46.060 --> 46:47.493
<i>Just like everybody else.</i>

46:47.561 --> 46:50.257
<i>I want my freedom
just like everybody else.</i>

46:51.365 --> 46:54.801
<i>I want to be treated just
like everybody else is treated.</i>

46:54.969 --> 46:56.436
<i>When we got out...</i>

46:57.171 --> 46:58.763
<i>...and I saw my parents...</i>

46:59.106 --> 47:01.097
<i>...all I wanted to do was hug them.</i>

47:01.175 --> 47:02.665
<i>I'll never forget...</i>

47:02.743 --> 47:04.074
...they were both crying.

47:04.145 --> 47:05.612
I'm trying to be like a man.

47:05.679 --> 47:07.874
I've been in jail now for five days.

47:08.082 --> 47:10.710
I'm wanting to cry,
but I'm trying to be real hard.

47:10.785 --> 47:12.548
You know, I've been there.

47:12.720 --> 47:14.017
It was a badge of courage.

47:14.088 --> 47:17.819
It was incredible,
and they were so proud of me.

47:18.526 --> 47:21.586
<i>Denise came in one day,
and she was saying...</i>

47:21.695 --> 47:24.459
<i>...to my cousin, Helen and me...</i>

47:24.532 --> 47:26.261
...if she could go march.

47:26.534 --> 47:30.436
We said, "No, you're too little. "
She said, "You're not too little. "

47:30.504 --> 47:33.029
I don't know how
we conveniently got out of that...

47:33.107 --> 47:36.941
...and didn't make ourselves look bad...

47:37.044 --> 47:39.512
...which is what we felt internally.

47:39.580 --> 47:41.411
Here's an infant saying...

47:41.549 --> 47:44.382
...you can do something about a situation,
and you refuse.

47:56.430 --> 47:59.422
<i>Kelly Ingram Park on May 3
was the turning point...</i>

47:59.500 --> 48:01.127
<i>...in the Birmingham movement.</i>

48:02.503 --> 48:04.733
It was a hot day.

48:05.706 --> 48:08.641
<i>It was 90 plus and humid in Birmingham.</i>

48:08.809 --> 48:11.073
<i>These firemen had been out there
for four hours...</i>

48:11.312 --> 48:15.772
<i>...waiting for something to happen
that wasn't apparently going to happen.</i>

48:16.951 --> 48:21.183
<i>And the crowd again had gathered,
and somebody threw a brick.</i>

48:23.591 --> 48:26.983
<i>The firemen, in their frustration...</i>

48:27.684 --> 48:30.312
<i>...they turned that water cannon on.</i>

48:30.987 --> 48:33.251
It was absolute helter-skelter.

48:33.323 --> 48:36.258
<i>You know how you take blowers
and blow leaves and things.</i>

48:36.326 --> 48:37.793
<i>This is how folks were.</i>

48:37.861 --> 48:41.194
<i>We were rolling past them,
trying to grab anything.</i>

48:41.264 --> 48:43.425
<i>The dogs were barking, biting...</i>

48:44.100 --> 48:45.658
<i>...boys were clubbing...</i>

48:45.735 --> 48:48.898
<i>The little kids on the inside,
for the most part, were protected.</i>

48:49.005 --> 48:52.702
<i>I don't know if anybody has ever
even thought about the pressure...</i>

48:52.943 --> 48:54.001
<i>...of one of those hoses.</i>

48:54.077 --> 48:55.305
You could just feel it sting.

48:55.378 --> 48:57.938
It was like being whipped,
with a whip or something.

48:58.248 --> 49:02.241
It just sort of hit me in the face
and went this way and took my hair out.

49:02.419 --> 49:04.546
<i>I have always been afraid of dogs.</i>

49:04.955 --> 49:09.654
<i>To have the police department
have dogs on us...</i>

49:09.726 --> 49:13.958
<i>There were people being bitten
by dogs as we were trying to run away...</i>

49:14.097 --> 49:17.362
<i>...from the dogs...</i>

49:17.467 --> 49:18.900
...and the fire hoses.

49:18.969 --> 49:21.267
Children were being
washed down the street.

49:21.338 --> 49:23.704
<i>It caught me right on 17th Street...</i>

49:23.773 --> 49:26.173
<i>...in front of a cafe called...</i>

49:26.242 --> 49:27.573
...Zanzibar.

49:27.877 --> 49:29.868
That's when it knocked me down.

49:29.946 --> 49:31.971
There was so much hate here then.

49:32.048 --> 49:34.016
They said, "Get this lady to a hospital."

49:34.117 --> 49:37.018
I said, "No. I'm afraid to go
to the hospital."

49:37.087 --> 49:38.748
I didn't know where they'd take me...

49:38.822 --> 49:40.687
...so I just suffered the consequences.

49:40.757 --> 49:43.988
<i>Yes, I will say this,
I'm going to be frank and tell you the truth.</i>

49:44.060 --> 49:46.858
<i>With the hose and the dogs and the folks...</i>

49:46.930 --> 49:48.192
...I was really afraid.

49:48.264 --> 49:51.427
But I respected
what they were marching for...

49:51.634 --> 49:54.194
...so I didn't march.

49:54.637 --> 49:57.162
<i>I was in Princeton, New Jersey, when...</i>

49:57.540 --> 50:00.907
...the fire hoses and the marches
in Kelly Ingram Park...

50:00.977 --> 50:02.842
...and near the church, were held.

50:03.380 --> 50:05.940
<i>They were on the front page
of the New York Times.</i>

50:06.116 --> 50:10.018
<i>I recall having to explain
to my professors...</i>

50:10.086 --> 50:11.417
<i>...and to my friends...</i>

50:11.488 --> 50:13.718
<i>...every single day that...</i>

50:14.124 --> 50:17.753
...all of Birmingham
hadn't erupted in violence.

50:18.428 --> 50:19.759
And in fact...

50:19.996 --> 50:22.055
...it was awfully hard to explain how...

50:22.198 --> 50:26.225
<i>...I didn't think the fire hoses were
the worst thing that could've happened...</i>

50:26.503 --> 50:28.596
...certainly compared to firearms...

50:29.806 --> 50:33.867
...certainly compared to killing and beating.

50:34.277 --> 50:35.801
It was devastating...

50:36.112 --> 50:39.081
...because it was just so ugly...

50:39.215 --> 50:41.615
...the way they were doing young people.

50:41.851 --> 50:45.446
To think a grown man would sit up
and put a fire hose on a child.

50:45.588 --> 50:49.217
It was awfuI, and I really didn't like it.

50:49.759 --> 50:54.025
As an individual there was nothing
I could do but pray, and I did a lot of that.

50:54.664 --> 50:58.293
<i>I think about the people
who went through all that...</i>

50:58.501 --> 51:00.196
<i>...back in those days.</i>

51:00.603 --> 51:03.299
<i>We did not give them credit for doing it...</i>

51:03.540 --> 51:05.474
<i>...because they fought my battle.</i>

51:05.575 --> 51:08.048
<i>I should have been out there.</i>

51:09.950 --> 51:14.114
...and particularly in the year 1963
when this took place...

51:14.721 --> 51:18.953
<i>...had become the focal point
of the struggle and the South.</i>

51:19.392 --> 51:22.953
<i>It had been sort of a violent year.</i>

51:24.331 --> 51:26.993
<i>In June, Medgar Evers had been killed.</i>

51:27.067 --> 51:30.036
But it was also a year
of ecstasy and triumph.

51:31.171 --> 51:33.071
On August 28...

51:33.139 --> 51:36.074
...a quarter of a million people
assembled in Washington D.C.

51:37.110 --> 51:39.601
<i>And those of us in the movement...</i>

51:39.679 --> 51:42.910
<i>...were almost as surprised
as we were delighted...</i>

51:43.049 --> 51:45.176
<i>...to see this magnificent thing happen.</i>

51:45.285 --> 51:47.310
<i>We felt, at the march...</i>

51:47.621 --> 51:51.421
<i>...that at last we had
the attention of America...</i>

51:51.725 --> 51:54.421
<i>...the Congress, the President,
and the world.</i>

52:02.035 --> 52:03.263
<i>I was angry with Chris...</i>

52:03.370 --> 52:04.496
...during that time...

52:04.571 --> 52:07.972
...because he'd done something
that I didn't think was kosher.

52:11.244 --> 52:14.236
I'm walking around glaring at him,
both of them...

52:14.314 --> 52:16.339
...because seemingly in my mind...

52:16.416 --> 52:19.613
...they were, you know, infringing on me.

52:19.886 --> 52:21.717
My wife, I think, had eaten.

52:21.788 --> 52:25.417
When I came home, evidently,
she didn't have what I wanted to eat.

52:26.793 --> 52:29.626
I decided I wanted a broiled chicken.

52:31.464 --> 52:34.900
<i>So I proceeded to get a chicken,
cut up a chicken...</i>

52:37.037 --> 52:39.870
Denise came up there, where I was.

52:39.939 --> 52:42.203
She jumped up on the kitchen counter.

52:42.575 --> 52:45.100
Her mother came in the kitchen
and looked at her...

52:45.211 --> 52:47.076
...and she looked at me...

52:47.180 --> 52:49.978
...and I didn't tell her to get off the counter.

52:50.383 --> 52:53.284
"Daddy didn't tell me to move,
'bye to you. "

52:53.386 --> 52:56.014
I just thought that sitting on the counter...

52:56.089 --> 52:59.024
<i>...in the kitchen,
where you're going to put food...</i>

52:59.459 --> 53:01.086
No. That's a no-no.

53:01.361 --> 53:03.420
So I let her sit up there.

53:04.331 --> 53:07.858
I finished cutting up the chicken,
cleaned it, seasoned it...

53:08.001 --> 53:10.561
...proceeded to broil it, did broil it.

53:10.637 --> 53:12.901
Then we ate the chicken, had a good time.

53:12.972 --> 53:13.996
To me...

53:14.074 --> 53:18.010
...and I've often referred to it
with my wife in that tone...

53:18.611 --> 53:21.079
...it was like the Last Supper...

53:21.915 --> 53:24.941
...as I imagine it would've been
with Christ and his disciples...

53:25.051 --> 53:26.416
...and I'm serious about this.

53:26.820 --> 53:30.347
Two weeks
before the church was bombed...

53:30.657 --> 53:32.522
...my mother was in the kitchen.

53:32.592 --> 53:35.789
We were getting ready for church
and all those things.

53:35.895 --> 53:37.954
She was standing there at the sink.

53:38.064 --> 53:42.057
Then she turned around and said to Ray,
my oldest brother:

53:43.103 --> 53:46.266
"I know you've been going out there
leading those demonstrations...

53:46.339 --> 53:49.274
"... leaving school
and going down to Birmingham.

53:49.876 --> 53:51.343
"I know you've been doing that. "

53:51.411 --> 53:53.902
He didn't admit it, but he wouldn't deny it.

53:53.980 --> 53:56.915
She said, "Mama just wants
to ask you this:

53:57.684 --> 54:00.346
"Don't go back
into 16th Street Baptist Church.

54:01.187 --> 54:04.156
"God has shown me something terrible
is going to happen there. "

54:04.357 --> 54:07.451
I dreamed, seemingly out
of a clear blue sky...

54:07.560 --> 54:10.154
...that there was going to be something...

54:10.230 --> 54:12.824
...terrible happening at 16th Street...

54:13.032 --> 54:15.330
...and I saw a lot of blood.

54:16.302 --> 54:19.169
I mentioned it at the breakfast table.

54:19.239 --> 54:21.332
It was on a Saturday morning.

54:21.674 --> 54:24.507
<i>I said, "Please, I don't want any of you... "</i>

54:24.577 --> 54:27.137
I said, "Ray, I don't want you...

54:27.213 --> 54:30.478
"... nowhere near
16th Street Baptist Church. "

54:31.951 --> 54:33.043
Ray went, "Ma!"

54:33.119 --> 54:36.919
Dad said, "Esther, don't tell the children
superstitious stuff like that. "

54:36.990 --> 54:40.949
And she said, "No, God has shown me.
I dreamed it last night.

54:41.027 --> 54:43.825
"It was just blood coming
all out of that church.

54:43.897 --> 54:45.728
"Blood just pouring out of the church.

54:45.832 --> 54:47.527
"I don't want any of my blood spilt. "

54:47.634 --> 54:49.499
<i>We were all looking like...</i>

54:49.569 --> 54:50.661
And then...

54:50.937 --> 54:54.395
...I guess, since Ray didn't respond
as we normally respond...

54:54.474 --> 54:55.964
<i>...when Mama demands something...</i>

54:56.042 --> 54:57.236
We weren't from a family...

54:57.310 --> 55:00.438
<i>...where your parents ask you
to do something, they told you...</i>

55:00.513 --> 55:01.605
He didn't respond...

55:01.681 --> 55:04.343
...and next thing, she just fell on her knees.

55:04.451 --> 55:06.476
And I started crying...

55:06.553 --> 55:09.954
...because it seemed so real to me
in the dream.

55:11.558 --> 55:15.688
When this happened
I think we all thought about it.

55:44.190 --> 55:47.125
<i>That Sunday was so dramatic,
traumatic, rather...</i>

55:47.193 --> 55:50.720
...until it's almost hard to talk about it.

55:53.399 --> 55:56.960
We were at our various homes...

55:57.036 --> 55:58.469
...getting ready for church.

55:59.005 --> 56:01.667
<i>This was the beginning...</i>

56:02.208 --> 56:04.642
<i>...of a monthly youth day service.</i>

56:04.711 --> 56:08.772
<i>The children were real excited
to have this opportunity to...</i>

56:09.115 --> 56:12.278
...take part in the leadership
of the church that day.

56:12.752 --> 56:16.017
<i>When Addie and Sarah
and I started to walk to church...</i>

56:16.623 --> 56:20.184
It usually takes about...

56:23.062 --> 56:26.520
<i>...maybe 15 or 20 minutes
to get to church...</i>

56:28.268 --> 56:31.669
That particular Sunday
it took a little bit longer, because...

56:32.605 --> 56:37.269
...we played a game with my purse.

56:37.343 --> 56:40.210
Like I said, it was shaped like a football.

56:40.580 --> 56:43.048
<i>It was just a regular Sunday morning.</i>

56:44.050 --> 56:46.712
Light breakfast and she left.

56:47.120 --> 56:49.918
She always went by my parents
on Sunday morning.

56:49.989 --> 56:51.286
<i>That particular Sunday...</i>

56:51.357 --> 56:54.451
...I was supposed to go
to Sunday school with Carole.

56:55.361 --> 56:57.226
I was running a little late...

56:57.297 --> 57:00.323
...and I didn't get an opportunity to go.

57:00.433 --> 57:02.298
We had the best time.

57:02.368 --> 57:06.828
We were laughing so hard
and playing so hard...

57:06.940 --> 57:10.899
...we just did it all the way to church,
just throwing it back and forth.

57:12.011 --> 57:16.448
<i>When we got to church,
I went down in the basement with them.</i>

57:17.050 --> 57:20.383
I didn't want to go up because
we had to get ourselves fixed up...

57:20.453 --> 57:22.546
...because we played
and messed ourselves up.

57:22.655 --> 57:25.749
<i>We'd been out to my sister's house
the night before...</i>

57:26.359 --> 57:28.122
...the afternoon before...

57:29.495 --> 57:30.928
<i>...and we didn't get to church...</i>

57:30.997 --> 57:35.400
...exactly on time to hear
all of what the preliminaries were...

57:35.468 --> 57:36.935
...for the Sunday school.

57:37.003 --> 57:39.938
She had this pretty white dress.

57:40.106 --> 57:43.507
She had new black shoes...

57:43.676 --> 57:45.735
...her first little heels, they were...

57:45.812 --> 57:48.747
...not high heels but the first heels
she had worn.

57:49.015 --> 57:50.607
I remember telling them:

57:50.817 --> 57:55.049
"Make sure when you get through
fixing your hair, you go upstairs...

57:55.121 --> 57:58.784
"... because we're already late
and we don't want to get any later. "

57:59.125 --> 58:00.922
Thirty-three years ago today...

58:01.194 --> 58:04.095
...I left home, coming to Sunday school...

58:04.297 --> 58:06.094
...to this, my church, 16th Street.

58:06.332 --> 58:09.392
<i>I had just walked up the steps...</i>

58:09.802 --> 58:11.895
<i>...and walked out into the sanctuary.</i>

58:11.971 --> 58:14.599
<i>The phone rang before
I walked out into the sanctuary.</i>

58:14.674 --> 58:17.643
<i>This was the second phone call
I had taken that morning.</i>

58:17.710 --> 58:20.406
<i>The caller on the other end said,
"Three minutes. "</i>

58:20.913 --> 58:25.009
Being 14 years old,
I had no idea that it meant anything.

58:25.151 --> 58:28.484
When I walked into the church,
it was like, wow!

58:28.721 --> 58:30.655
The first thing I said was:

58:30.857 --> 58:32.722
"It looks strange in here. "

58:32.825 --> 58:34.884
The feeling that I felt.

58:34.961 --> 58:37.191
<i>I even noticed it. It was like...</i>

58:37.296 --> 58:40.891
I've never felt this in this church before.
It was a different feeling.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.865
I was one of the Sunday school teachers.

58:42.935 --> 58:45.665
<i>My class was downstairs
in the basement...</i>

58:46.372 --> 58:48.499
...near where the bombing took place.

58:48.708 --> 58:52.644
I think I was the last person in the family
to see Denise that morning.

58:52.879 --> 58:54.938
I went on upstairs to my class...

58:55.014 --> 58:58.245
...in the choir loft, and she went
downstairs in the basement.

58:58.484 --> 59:00.816
Denise came to my room...

59:02.522 --> 59:04.513
...and I said, "What are you doing in here?"

59:04.590 --> 59:08.856
She said, "I came to borrow your comb,
your compact and a quarter. "

59:08.928 --> 59:10.691
I said, "Don't you have any of that?

59:10.797 --> 59:12.697
"No. " Her mother wouldn't give it to her.

59:12.799 --> 59:15.646
So she borrowed my comb,
my compact and a quarter.

59:15.780 --> 59:18.442
The next thing I heard was this loud blast...

59:18.883 --> 59:21.579
...and my first words were,
"My baby, my baby. "

59:21.819 --> 59:25.778
It was just a loud noise and
the building shook, and I just remember...

59:26.424 --> 59:29.689
...something hitting me in my head,
a piece of the light fixture...

59:29.794 --> 59:31.819
<i>...and just screams...</i>

59:33.197 --> 59:36.030
I just remember seeing
black soot everywhere.

59:36.100 --> 59:40.264
My first reaction was I thought
Russia had sent a sputnik bomb.

59:40.605 --> 59:43.369
I remember reading the paper
at that time, about Russia...

59:43.441 --> 59:46.569
...and about bombs and things like that.

59:47.278 --> 59:49.246
I didn't think they'd bomb that church.

59:49.380 --> 59:52.781
<i>When I heard the noise from my church...</i>

59:53.017 --> 59:57.681
<i>...it sounded a little like thunder,
it was an overcast day, but...</i>

59:58.422 --> 01:00:01.653
I turned to my brother and said:
"Was that thunder?" He said, "No. "

01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:04.054
My husband had carried...

01:00:04.295 --> 01:00:08.425
...Carole to Sunday school and I was
dressing for church when I heard the bomb.

01:00:08.866 --> 01:00:11.960
<i>I think I was in the bathroom
putting on make-up.</i>

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:14.861
My parents and I,
my sisters and brothers...

01:00:14.972 --> 01:00:18.738
...we were all sitting down
at the table eating breakfast.

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:20.672
The whole house shook.

01:00:20.811 --> 01:00:25.111
Birmingham was always known for
foundries and blasting and things like this.

01:00:25.216 --> 01:00:27.309
When you hear it, sometimes you think...

01:00:27.418 --> 01:00:30.546
...that it's one of the foundries
blasting coal, iron or whatever.

01:00:30.688 --> 01:00:32.383
We didn't want to think the worst.

01:00:32.623 --> 01:00:36.218
Somehow or another
somebody had told our pastor...

01:00:36.494 --> 01:00:38.121
...that 16th Street had been bombed.

01:00:38.229 --> 01:00:42.859
We got the children together
and told them to hold hands.

01:00:42.933 --> 01:00:45.231
We went outside,
and when we got outside...

01:00:47.004 --> 01:00:50.167
<i>...all we could see were policemen.</i>

01:00:50.374 --> 01:00:52.604
<i>When we got on the outside...</i>

01:00:53.577 --> 01:00:58.071
...going down the steps, it was like,
I ran into Junie.

01:00:59.316 --> 01:01:00.943
And when I ran into Junie...

01:01:01.118 --> 01:01:05.248
...we were walking back and forth
and finally it struck us that...

01:01:06.023 --> 01:01:08.014
...we didn't see Addie and Sarah.

01:01:08.159 --> 01:01:12.596
<i>You can imagine just how terrible
it was for everybody.</i>

01:01:13.064 --> 01:01:16.625
<i>People were digging in the ashes,
among the rubble...</i>

01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:19.067
...trying to find their loved ones.

01:01:19.603 --> 01:01:23.369
In a few minutes my wife's cousin...

01:01:23.708 --> 01:01:26.700
...the one we call Mama Helen
who lives up the street there...

01:01:27.712 --> 01:01:30.306
...she came by in her car and she said:

01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:33.081
"Come on, go with me.
We can't find Denise. "

01:01:33.184 --> 01:01:34.845
I looked everywhere.

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:38.683
<i>All over the church, upstairs,
downstairs and everywhere.</i>

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:41.090
<i>And I couldn't find my children.</i>

01:01:41.525 --> 01:01:44.016
I immediately reached down and pulled...

01:01:44.095 --> 01:01:47.929
...one of the large concrete blocks away.

01:01:48.632 --> 01:01:51.396
And there was one of the girls' head...

01:01:51.635 --> 01:01:53.102
...I had discovered.

01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:56.131
God, when I found out that my classmate...

01:01:56.574 --> 01:02:00.874
<i>...Cynthia, was one of them,
the first thought was...</i>

01:02:01.011 --> 01:02:04.469
...that I saw her
as we were leaving school...

01:02:05.316 --> 01:02:08.808
...that Friday, and we said to each other:

01:02:08.919 --> 01:02:10.546
"See you Monday. "

01:02:12.323 --> 01:02:16.555
She said something, I don't remember,
but something to make me laugh.

01:02:17.695 --> 01:02:20.186
We said, just rushing, "See you Monday. "

01:02:20.297 --> 01:02:24.290
But I remember so vividly
looking into her eyes.

01:02:24.635 --> 01:02:27.729
When did you find out that Carole
had been in the blast?

01:02:28.272 --> 01:02:32.936
When my husband and my mother
and all came in to tell me.

01:02:35.579 --> 01:02:37.376
Oh, boy.

01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:42.143
<i>It was just... It was awfuI.</i>

01:02:43.187 --> 01:02:46.520
<i>They told me, let's see...</i>

01:02:47.258 --> 01:02:50.989
My husband told me first,
because he got here first.

01:02:53.531 --> 01:02:55.965
He was upset.

01:02:56.901 --> 01:03:00.962
He was the kind of gentleman...

01:03:01.038 --> 01:03:04.565
...he was kind, nice.

01:03:05.342 --> 01:03:09.039
I guess, he just didn't believe
anybody would do anything like that.

01:03:09.146 --> 01:03:13.845
He died not realizing
that people do things like that.

01:03:15.152 --> 01:03:17.313
<i>Someone came and told me that...</i>

01:03:18.689 --> 01:03:20.247
<i>Miss...</i>

01:03:24.628 --> 01:03:27.324
Mrs. Arnold carried me to the hospital
so I could see her.

01:03:28.132 --> 01:03:32.125
When we got to University Hospital
and started searching, we ran upon...

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:35.300
...another one of my wife's cousins.

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:40.600
His name is Cleveland and
we called him Brother Cleveland.

01:03:41.111 --> 01:03:45.411
At any rate,
he helped us search around and we found...

01:03:45.749 --> 01:03:48.343
...the room that they were using
as a morgue.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.520
In there were all four of the girls
Iying up there.

01:03:54.525 --> 01:03:57.255
Then there was Denise among them with...

01:03:57.695 --> 01:03:59.925
...this piece of concrete...

01:04:00.064 --> 01:04:03.227
...mortar-like rock, embedded in her head.

01:04:12.509 --> 01:04:14.204
When I got there...

01:04:16.647 --> 01:04:19.411
...my cousin, Henry, was there.

01:04:20.117 --> 01:04:21.812
He was very angry.

01:04:23.621 --> 01:04:26.818
He was using words
that let you know he was angry, too.

01:04:27.124 --> 01:04:30.890
And the lady wanted to know who I was.

01:04:31.195 --> 01:04:33.789
I told her that I heard that my daughter...

01:04:33.964 --> 01:04:36.933
...Denise McNair, had been killed.

01:04:37.001 --> 01:04:40.630
She said, "You're Maxine. "
I got so angry with her!

01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:44.002
How dare she call me Maxine?
She wasn't a friend of mine.

01:04:44.475 --> 01:04:46.238
She didn't know me from Adam.

01:04:46.877 --> 01:04:50.335
And here she's going to take the liberty
of calling me by my name.

01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:52.572
I said, "I'm Mrs. Chris McNair.

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:54.880
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," was her comment.

01:04:55.019 --> 01:04:58.250
But it was too late, she'd done it.
That old mentality:

01:04:58.355 --> 01:05:01.290
"You're nothing and I'm something,"
came out.

01:05:01.692 --> 01:05:04.320
She went in and then she let me go in
and see her.

01:05:04.395 --> 01:05:07.455
She said, "But your husband
has already identified her. "

01:05:07.631 --> 01:05:10.065
But that was my privilege to...

01:05:10.701 --> 01:05:13.431
...identify my child, to me.

01:05:14.238 --> 01:05:16.729
I didn't think anybody
should take it away from me...

01:05:17.074 --> 01:05:20.942
...and I'm sure I said as much, because
by that time, I was kind of ticked off.

01:05:21.712 --> 01:05:23.373
Okay...

01:05:23.714 --> 01:05:25.545
...they carried me on
to my mother's house.

01:05:25.616 --> 01:05:29.143
When I got in there,
I couldn't stop hollering.

01:05:29.687 --> 01:05:32.155
I couldn't stop screaming.

01:05:34.825 --> 01:05:38.022
I can just see myself,
sitting in the chair, just...

01:05:38.929 --> 01:05:40.794
...being so upset...

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.199
...in a place that I wanted to rub
and I couldn't rub it.

01:05:48.906 --> 01:05:52.433
I later found out that I was
the only parent that was...

01:05:53.043 --> 01:05:54.874
...at church that day.

01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:07.484
I'm quite sure that my parents...

01:06:08.525 --> 01:06:11.688
...they identified a body but...

01:06:12.429 --> 01:06:15.364
...all I heard was that my sister, Junie...

01:06:15.566 --> 01:06:17.500
...had identified the body.

01:06:17.935 --> 01:06:21.701
Because it had somewhat
of an affect left upon her.

01:06:22.006 --> 01:06:26.409
It had a really kind of a nervous-like,
you know.

01:06:27.277 --> 01:06:28.972
It really affected her.

01:06:29.947 --> 01:06:31.847
<i>It was just a devastating...</i>

01:06:32.683 --> 01:06:34.082
...experience.

01:06:36.387 --> 01:06:37.718
I...

01:06:40.024 --> 01:06:42.993
...experienced a lot of panic attacks, too.

01:06:43.427 --> 01:06:45.190
Once upon a time I was...

01:06:46.563 --> 01:06:49.555
...real afraid of being on the...

01:06:49.933 --> 01:06:52.527
...outside, as well as the inside.

01:06:54.605 --> 01:06:55.833
Of what?

01:06:56.673 --> 01:07:01.372
Of anywhere. Because the bombing
happened in a church where...

01:07:02.312 --> 01:07:06.305
...you normally would feel safe,
or you'd think you were safe.

01:07:07.885 --> 01:07:11.656
And of all places, you know, a church.

01:07:12.223 --> 01:07:13.690
<i>That Sunday...</i>

01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:18.786
<i>...when the little girls were killed,
in the church...</i>

01:07:20.231 --> 01:07:24.429
<i>...my former husband and I, Jim Bevel...</i>

01:07:25.971 --> 01:07:28.064
...were in Edenton, North Carolina.

01:07:29.908 --> 01:07:34.038
The Southern Christian Leadership
Conference was carrying out a...

01:07:34.212 --> 01:07:36.680
...voter registration project.

01:07:36.881 --> 01:07:39.247
I was scheduled to preach
that Sunday morning.

01:07:39.684 --> 01:07:43.950
When the church blew up,
we heard about it before I got to church.

01:07:44.522 --> 01:07:47.150
And we felt that...

01:07:47.592 --> 01:07:50.390
...in order to respect ourselves...

01:07:50.695 --> 01:07:53.323
...as an adult man and woman...

01:07:53.832 --> 01:07:57.233
...we could not let little girls be killed.

01:07:57.535 --> 01:08:00.436
It was like somebody was hitting me
with hot steel.

01:08:00.839 --> 01:08:03.637
<i>And I felt personally insulted,
because it was like...</i>

01:08:03.742 --> 01:08:06.210
They knew these children
was using that church...

01:08:06.544 --> 01:08:10.674
...and they really felt insulted because
the children have defeated them, right?

01:08:10.882 --> 01:08:14.784
They're coming back on the children to say:
"We will teach you a lesson. "

01:08:14.853 --> 01:08:16.946
My point is,
"No, we will teach you a lesson. "

01:08:17.087 --> 01:08:20.080
We felt that there were two things
that we could do.

01:08:20.992 --> 01:08:24.553
The first option is that we...

01:08:24.763 --> 01:08:27.663
...felt confident that we could find out...

01:08:28.066 --> 01:08:31.832
...who was responsible
for having killed those girls...

01:08:32.337 --> 01:08:36.033
...and we could make certain
that they got killed.

01:08:37.475 --> 01:08:39.033
That was option one.

01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:41.608
I said:

01:08:41.712 --> 01:08:45.149
"I'm going to have to get out
of the movement and kill these guys.

01:08:45.316 --> 01:08:47.113
"We are not going to let guys...

01:08:47.218 --> 01:08:50.118
"... come in here, blow up our churches
and kill our children.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.688
"We're not going to do it. "

01:08:52.157 --> 01:08:55.251
The second option was...

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.256
...that if blacks in Alabama
got the right to vote...

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:01.558
...they could protect their children.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.096
That's where...

01:09:03.368 --> 01:09:04.960
<i>...this bombing of the church...</i>

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:09.069
<i>...is where the Selma Right to Vote
movement was born.</i>

01:09:10.542 --> 01:09:12.567
<i>I remember that Sunday very clearly.</i>

01:09:12.711 --> 01:09:14.872
I'm not sure where I went to church.

01:09:15.613 --> 01:09:18.707
As I think about it now
I probably took that Sunday off.

01:09:18.817 --> 01:09:21.377
But I know I got an urgent call
from Dr. King.

01:09:22.153 --> 01:09:24.621
He told me they'd bombed
the 16th Street Church...

01:09:24.723 --> 01:09:28.955
...and four little girls were dead.
We had to go to Birmingham right away.

01:09:30.194 --> 01:09:33.858
I don't know where we met, but we
had a great deal of conversation about it.

01:09:33.932 --> 01:09:38.493
Dr. King said, he began to bemoan the fact,
"They're going to blame me. "

01:09:39.804 --> 01:09:43.001
He was supersensitive
about things like this.

01:09:43.073 --> 01:09:46.042
<i>He said, "People will say,
if we'd never come to Birmingham...</i>

01:09:46.211 --> 01:09:49.703
"We got to go.
I dread going, but we've got to go. "

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.877
We got ourselves together and went over
to see the families and whatnot.

01:09:54.018 --> 01:09:58.614
<i>Dr. King came by the parsonage
where I was living...</i>

01:09:58.990 --> 01:10:00.981
...the early part of that evening...

01:10:01.826 --> 01:10:05.728
...and talked with me about
the funeral arrangements. I told him...

01:10:06.965 --> 01:10:10.526
...that we tried to get a mass funeral but...

01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:13.996
...there was one family
that wanted to hold out.

01:10:14.105 --> 01:10:16.938
I tell you, we got up Monday morning...

01:10:17.041 --> 01:10:19.373
...and started making plans.

01:10:19.844 --> 01:10:21.869
Planned everything because...

01:10:22.747 --> 01:10:26.239
...we had no idea they were planning
a joint funeral until...

01:10:26.484 --> 01:10:28.611
...late Monday evening when...

01:10:29.287 --> 01:10:32.279
...King and Cross...

01:10:32.857 --> 01:10:36.418
...Abernathy, Gardner, Smith...

01:10:36.761 --> 01:10:38.353
...there were seven of them...

01:10:38.563 --> 01:10:41.396
...Shuttlesworth, that came out.

01:10:41.599 --> 01:10:43.965
Dr. King talked as he...

01:10:44.068 --> 01:10:47.435
...tried to persuade her to change her mind.

01:10:48.406 --> 01:10:50.670
She said, "I told Rev. Cross...

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:54.139
"... what my intentions are
and that's what I want to do. "

01:10:54.813 --> 01:10:56.007
So...

01:10:57.248 --> 01:10:59.011
...he had prayer with her...

01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:01.844
...and then we left.

01:11:02.687 --> 01:11:06.088
<i>I don't know what we would've done
if we'd known early on Monday...</i>

01:11:06.157 --> 01:11:08.523
<i>...that they were planning a mass funeral.</i>

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.925
<i>I don't know what the decision
would have been, then.</i>

01:11:13.231 --> 01:11:14.357
<i>But...</i>

01:11:14.499 --> 01:11:18.094
<i>...we went about the business during
that Monday and we just let it stay.</i>

01:11:23.074 --> 01:11:26.532
<i>We went downtown and we picked out...</i>

01:11:26.978 --> 01:11:28.639
Her favorite color was yellow.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.607
So we went to Parisian's...

01:11:30.982 --> 01:11:34.679
...and we got her a yellow dress.

01:11:35.053 --> 01:11:38.454
And the lady knew me because
I had been shopping there before.

01:11:39.357 --> 01:11:43.521
Then she was saying
how sorry she was, and...

01:11:44.295 --> 01:11:46.160
...she sold me the dress...

01:11:46.464 --> 01:11:49.399
...and the socks and whatever else
I bought that day.

01:11:49.868 --> 01:11:52.598
We carried it on over to the funeral home...

01:11:52.871 --> 01:11:55.431
...and put it on her.

01:11:57.208 --> 01:12:01.008
The man told me that they weren't
going to be able to do a good job...

01:12:01.312 --> 01:12:03.246
...with fixing her up because...

01:12:04.148 --> 01:12:07.208
...the brick that we found, that we have...

01:12:07.719 --> 01:12:09.846
...was embedded in her head and it had...

01:12:10.121 --> 01:12:12.885
...done something to her skin on this side.

01:12:12.991 --> 01:12:14.982
<i>He said, "But we will make it...</i>

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.451
"We will make it look
the very best that we can.

01:12:18.663 --> 01:12:20.221
"We won't disappoint you. "

01:12:20.398 --> 01:12:23.799
I had trust and faith in him
because he was a friend of mine.

01:12:25.203 --> 01:12:27.763
And sure enough, they pulled the hair...

01:12:28.506 --> 01:12:31.964
...around and fixed her up,
and she looked nice.

01:12:33.544 --> 01:12:37.480
<i>Carole's funeral was a very quiet funeral.</i>

01:12:37.715 --> 01:12:41.515
<i>I mean, just a normal, sad funeral.</i>

01:12:41.953 --> 01:12:46.287
Whereas, the next day I mean,
it was more spectacular...

01:12:47.025 --> 01:12:50.586
...with the news
and they were there from everywhere.

01:13:07.512 --> 01:13:11.642
<i>What I really remember most was
when we got out of the car to the church...</i>

01:13:12.317 --> 01:13:14.717
...I remember looking up
and there were cameras...

01:13:14.819 --> 01:13:16.650
...and people in the trees.

01:13:17.555 --> 01:13:19.989
<i>The family could hardly get in the church.</i>

01:13:20.525 --> 01:13:23.688
<i>Most kids didn't go to the funeral.
School was going on...</i>

01:13:25.463 --> 01:13:27.727
But I remember specifically...

01:13:27.932 --> 01:13:30.196
...I'd worn a shirt and tie that day.

01:13:30.635 --> 01:13:32.569
And George Bell, my principal...

01:13:33.438 --> 01:13:34.996
...the famous George Bell...

01:13:36.007 --> 01:13:38.874
...as I was leaving,
I got a note from my mother...

01:13:40.545 --> 01:13:43.036
...came up to me and took his tie off.

01:13:43.147 --> 01:13:47.277
He said, "Son, you want to wear
dark ties to funerals. "

01:13:48.019 --> 01:13:50.044
<i>He said, "You're representing us. "</i>

01:13:59.964 --> 01:14:03.331
<i>Then, inside the service...</i>

01:14:06.337 --> 01:14:09.329
<i>...Dr. King spoke.</i>

01:14:11.642 --> 01:14:16.079
<i>And we tried to not cry and listen...</i>

01:14:16.848 --> 01:14:20.249
<i>...but there was not a dry eye in the house.</i>

01:14:21.185 --> 01:14:22.482
And...

01:14:23.321 --> 01:14:26.552
...his speaking calmed us...

01:14:27.492 --> 01:14:30.484
...and I think the crying helped.

01:14:30.828 --> 01:14:34.229
<i>I remember Martin Luther King
when he was there.</i>

01:14:34.966 --> 01:14:38.527
But I can't remember
everything that he said...

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:41.363
...because you are so hurt...

01:14:42.006 --> 01:14:44.736
...you're seeing three caskets...

01:14:45.109 --> 01:14:47.441
...around the front part of the church.

01:14:47.578 --> 01:14:51.014
And you know your sister
is in one of those caskets.

01:14:51.349 --> 01:14:54.910
You can't really listen.
The only thing you can do is feel...

01:14:55.186 --> 01:14:58.212
...and there was just nothing
but hurt that I felt.

01:14:59.157 --> 01:15:03.355
<i>And at some point he said something
about life is hard...</i>

01:15:03.461 --> 01:15:05.622
<i>...or life is as hard as steel.</i>

01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:08.928
<i>Things you remember; The three coffins...</i>

01:15:09.434 --> 01:15:13.836
<i>...this group of hundreds
of black and white ministers...</i>

01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:16.803
...and others, famous people.

01:15:17.573 --> 01:15:20.974
"But life is as hard as steel."

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:25.044
Not an exact quote, but that was the point.
I'll never forget that.

01:15:26.115 --> 01:15:29.016
<i>The service was sad, but it wasn't morbid.</i>

01:15:29.652 --> 01:15:32.985
<i>It was a tender moment, but
at the same time, it was a sad moment.</i>

01:15:33.089 --> 01:15:34.784
<i>Because the realization was...</i>

01:15:34.891 --> 01:15:38.088
<i>...these little girls would never get
a chance to realize life.</i>

01:15:38.361 --> 01:15:42.195
Because of some person's decision
to make...

01:15:42.498 --> 01:15:46.867
...them, maybe the victims,
of why the movement should stop.

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:58.671
<i>I remember coming down the steps
at Addie's and Denise's funeral...</i>

01:15:59.115 --> 01:16:00.844
<i>...and letting go of the casket.</i>

01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:03.050
I don't know, I just lost something.

01:16:03.452 --> 01:16:05.647
This was one of my best friends in life...

01:16:05.855 --> 01:16:09.086
...and I had never lost a best friend before.

01:16:09.392 --> 01:16:11.883
And James Stewart grabbed me
and held me, man...

01:16:11.961 --> 01:16:14.395
...because I lost complete...

01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:17.062
...faith in humanity and didn't know it.

01:16:17.166 --> 01:16:20.897
I remember being very, very, uptight...

01:16:22.505 --> 01:16:23.665
...and...

01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:30.411
...just overwhelmed by something.

01:16:31.814 --> 01:16:36.251
<i>The next thing I knew, somebody was
saying, "You passed out at the cemetery. "</i>

01:16:37.753 --> 01:16:40.017
<i>"Dear Mr. and Mrs. McNair;</i>

01:16:40.356 --> 01:16:42.756
<i>"Here in the midst
of the Christmas season...</i>

01:16:43.125 --> 01:16:45.787
<i>"... my thoughts have turned to you.</i>

01:16:46.195 --> 01:16:48.857
<i>"This has been a difficult year for you...</i>

01:16:49.265 --> 01:16:53.793
<i>"... the coming of Christmas when
the family bonds are more closely knit...</i>

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:59.066
"... makes the loss you have sustained
even more painfuI.

01:17:00.376 --> 01:17:02.367
"Yet, with the sad memories...

01:17:02.778 --> 01:17:05.008
<i>"... there are the memories
of the good days...</i>

01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:08.539
<i>"... when Denise was with you
and your family.</i>

01:17:09.552 --> 01:17:12.988
<i>"As you know,
many of us are giving up our Christmas...</i>

01:17:13.389 --> 01:17:17.883
<i>"... or severely limiting them as a memorial
for the great sacrifices...</i>

01:17:17.994 --> 01:17:20.861
<i>"... made this year in the freedom struggle.</i>

01:17:21.898 --> 01:17:25.356
<i>"I know there is nothing that can
compensate for the vacant place...</i>

01:17:25.468 --> 01:17:27.265
<i>"... in your family circle.</i>

01:17:27.536 --> 01:17:31.996
<i>"But we did want to share a part
of our sacrifice, this year, with you.</i>

01:17:32.909 --> 01:17:37.642
<i>"Perhaps, there is some small thing
dear to your heart...</i>

01:17:38.047 --> 01:17:40.743
<i>"... in which this gift can play a part.</i>

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:44.449
<i>"Sincerely yours, Martin Luther King, Jr. "</i>

01:17:45.955 --> 01:17:48.890
This was photographed, Mother's Day '62.

01:17:49.225 --> 01:17:51.785
We were on our way to church,
Sunday school...

01:17:52.261 --> 01:17:55.094
...and he snapped this shot.
She said, "Wait, Daddy...

01:17:55.231 --> 01:17:57.096
"... I'm not ready, you're too fast. "

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.129
He snapped it anyway.

01:17:59.235 --> 01:18:03.137
We were running late
so he didn't do it over, that I recall.

01:18:04.106 --> 01:18:06.233
These are some of her coloring books and...

01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:09.435
...things that we found in a trunk...

01:18:09.545 --> 01:18:13.311
...that were musty and old
and tired looking.

01:18:14.216 --> 01:18:16.776
She loved dolls and toys...

01:18:17.353 --> 01:18:19.253
...and if she could make a...

01:18:19.822 --> 01:18:23.622
...tacky little something, that I called tacky,
that she didn't call tacky...

01:18:24.293 --> 01:18:26.591
...doll clothes, piggy banks...

01:18:27.029 --> 01:18:28.326
...jewelry...

01:18:29.198 --> 01:18:32.065
...pocketbooks, things she did in school.

01:18:32.301 --> 01:18:36.567
This was taken one Sunday in Tupelo,
Mississippi, where we lived.

01:18:37.139 --> 01:18:41.303
We had come home from church
and she had gotten tired of staying...

01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:45.210
...because we would go for Sunday school
and it seemed like an all day thing.

01:18:45.548 --> 01:18:48.676
And she went to sleep,
and she was wrinkled.

01:18:48.784 --> 01:18:51.753
Her daddy liked the little outfit she had on,
so he said:

01:18:51.854 --> 01:18:54.015
"I want a picture. " I said, "Let me press it.

01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:55.955
"No, I want it just like it is. "

01:18:56.425 --> 01:19:00.987
This was the strange brick that was...

01:19:01.230 --> 01:19:03.130
...that penetrated her skull...

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.567
...that a friend of mine
at the cemetery saved...

01:19:08.304 --> 01:19:11.535
...and gave to my mother,
and my mother some years later...

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.005
...gave to me.

01:19:14.777 --> 01:19:16.642
When I was going to school...

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:21.316
...before, after she had died,
when I was going to school...

01:19:21.417 --> 01:19:23.510
...it was like, you know how you just...

01:19:23.819 --> 01:19:27.118
...remember such a good time
you used to have?

01:19:27.656 --> 01:19:29.487
You know you'll have a good time...

01:19:29.592 --> 01:19:32.152
...at home because you're going to get
with your sister.

01:19:32.228 --> 01:19:36.028
That was the type of relationship we had.
I knew that when I got home...

01:19:36.399 --> 01:19:39.425
...me and Addie was going to have us
a good time playing.

01:19:39.568 --> 01:19:42.469
I rushed home that evening from school...

01:19:42.705 --> 01:19:46.072
...thinking that I was rushing home
to get with Addie.

01:19:46.809 --> 01:19:48.936
I had remembered that Addie was dead.

01:19:49.545 --> 01:19:52.981
<i>That thing hurt me.
It hurt me so deep until...</i>

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:08.994
It's not easy, because we had put so much
of this behind us...

01:20:10.399 --> 01:20:12.162
...and we don't remember.

01:20:21.677 --> 01:20:24.145
We don't remember anymore,
you know what I'm saying?

01:20:24.413 --> 01:20:26.779
But you know how you felt.

01:20:27.416 --> 01:20:30.977
You may not remember details or what...

01:20:32.354 --> 01:20:35.255
...step by step, what I had to go through...

01:20:35.558 --> 01:20:38.288
...but I do know it affected me...

01:20:39.795 --> 01:20:41.023
...so bad.

01:20:44.667 --> 01:20:48.797
I don't think the white community
really understood...

01:20:48.938 --> 01:20:52.430
...the depth of the problem
and the depths of the hate...

01:20:52.708 --> 01:20:56.940
...of the Klan and its friends in the South...

01:20:57.279 --> 01:20:59.474
...in the North, too, for that matter...

01:20:59.715 --> 01:21:02.616
...until that incredibly...

01:21:02.751 --> 01:21:05.743
...mean-spirited, terrible crime...

01:21:05.821 --> 01:21:09.313
...of blowing up kids
in a Sunday school basement.

01:21:10.292 --> 01:21:13.989
Up to that time,
I think it was looked at primarily...

01:21:14.363 --> 01:21:16.331
...as a...

01:21:16.732 --> 01:21:19.963
...an interesting kind
of a social development...

01:21:20.035 --> 01:21:23.994
...that would come along somehow
or other in the generations to come.

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:28.501
At that moment that bomb went off,
and those four little girls were...

01:21:28.644 --> 01:21:32.978
...blasted and buried in the debris
of the church...

01:21:34.049 --> 01:21:37.746
...America understood the real nature
of the hate...

01:21:38.087 --> 01:21:41.079
...that was preventing integration,
particularly in the South...

01:21:41.223 --> 01:21:43.487
...but also throughout America.

01:21:43.726 --> 01:21:45.489
This was the awakening.

01:21:45.761 --> 01:21:47.319
I think...

01:21:48.264 --> 01:21:50.926
...that incident, as tragic as it was...

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.197
...convinced white America more deeply
than anything else...

01:21:54.336 --> 01:21:57.737
...why there had to be a Birmingham
confrontation and why...

01:21:58.607 --> 01:22:01.735
...there needed to be a Martin Luther King
on the issue of race.

01:22:02.578 --> 01:22:05.411
The bombing of the churches...

01:22:06.248 --> 01:22:10.378
...in Birmingham, with the death
of the little girls...

01:22:11.253 --> 01:22:15.747
...was just an act of terrorism
in my judgment, and those are the...

01:22:16.392 --> 01:22:20.453
...many ways, as we know today,
the hardest ones to resolve...

01:22:20.563 --> 01:22:24.795
...and the cruelest,
because they don't care who it is...

01:22:25.201 --> 01:22:27.999
...that gets killed, as long as...

01:22:28.571 --> 01:22:31.199
...there's some symbolism
in what they're doing.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:33.369
It just seemed pointless.

01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:37.167
It wasn't going to stop the movement.

01:22:39.248 --> 01:22:42.945
It just took the lives of four beautiful
innocent little girls.

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:48.281
Four lovely children...

01:22:50.059 --> 01:22:53.586
...today could have been
Spellman graduates...

01:22:53.796 --> 01:22:55.525
...Harvard graduates.

01:22:55.864 --> 01:22:58.856
Could have been doing things
in their community.

01:22:59.068 --> 01:23:00.558
Could have been...

01:23:00.803 --> 01:23:03.931
...wonderful doctors, lawyers.

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.737
Or just plain hard working people.

01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:09.709
But human beings.

01:23:09.945 --> 01:23:13.108
The bad news is
four innocent babies were killed.

01:23:13.482 --> 01:23:17.578
The good news is we were able
to transform a crucifixion...

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:19.687
...into a resurrection.

01:23:19.755 --> 01:23:23.350
New life, new hope,
new energy and more determination.

01:23:24.293 --> 01:23:27.319
<i>120 years of history suddenly destroyed.</i>

01:23:27.396 --> 01:23:31.230
<i>Five churches with black congregations
have burned in Alabama this year.</i>

01:23:32.268 --> 01:23:36.864
<i>This is one of dozens of southern
black churches that burned.</i>

01:23:37.106 --> 01:23:39.301
<i>Last week somebody torched this church...</i>

01:23:39.375 --> 01:23:43.669
<i>President Clinton wants to know
if the fires are racially motivated.</i>

01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:45.932
What's painful to me
as we look at the story today...

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:48.399
...they're burning churches again.

01:23:49.976 --> 01:23:52.706
<i>More than anything
that really bothered me...</i>

01:23:52.812 --> 01:23:57.078
...was when I found out how many
churches had burned since 1994.

01:23:57.383 --> 01:24:00.181
Over 22 churches in the South
had burned down.

01:24:00.419 --> 01:24:04.014
People kept saying it was not a conspiracy
and things like that...

01:24:04.156 --> 01:24:07.751
...but the thing that I believe is
that it's a conspiracy of the mind.

01:24:08.027 --> 01:24:11.428
<i>Once you burn one down, other people
are going to burn others down.</i>

01:24:11.764 --> 01:24:13.254
This was true...

01:24:13.599 --> 01:24:16.466
<i>...after the Civil War
when the Ku Klux Klan was organized.</i>

01:24:16.535 --> 01:24:19.902
<i>They, too, burned black churches.
They had a symbol where they set...</i>

01:24:20.139 --> 01:24:22.505
...the cross of Jesus on fire.

01:24:22.642 --> 01:24:25.304
<i>They're still doing it,
but the result will be the same.</i>

01:24:25.511 --> 01:24:28.844
We're going to rebuild those churches
and make them big and stronger.

01:24:29.048 --> 01:24:30.948
The message has to be clear.

01:24:31.317 --> 01:24:35.151
You can burn them down, but not faster
than we can build them up again.

01:24:36.222 --> 01:24:39.419
<i>Four young black girls were killed
in the 1963 bombing...</i>

01:24:39.492 --> 01:24:42.086
<i>...of the 16th Street Baptist Church
in Birmingham.</i>

01:24:42.328 --> 01:24:44.694
<i>It was one of many bombings
near Birmingham...</i>

01:24:44.764 --> 01:24:48.359
<i>...during the late '50s and early '60s,
and it was never solved.</i>

01:24:48.734 --> 01:24:51.532
<i>Last month a grand jury began
a new investigation...</i>

01:24:51.637 --> 01:24:53.867
<i>...and yesterday indicted two men.</i>

01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:58.167
<i>One was Robert Chambliss of Birmingham,
a former Ku Klux Klan member.</i>

01:24:58.377 --> 01:25:01.369
<i>Chambliss, jailed last night,
is being held without bond...</i>

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.675
<i>...on four counts of first degree murder.</i>

01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:06.248
<i>I think Bob Chambliss was responsible...</i>

01:25:06.619 --> 01:25:08.416
<i>...for more evil than any other...</i>

01:25:09.622 --> 01:25:10.987
...human being...

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:15.383
...in the history of this county,
maybe this state.

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:18.656
<i>I won't say he's the most evil man
because I can't judge.</i>

01:25:18.731 --> 01:25:22.531
<i>But he was responsible for more evil
because he, by himself...</i>

01:25:22.735 --> 01:25:26.364
...was responsible for nearly
all the bombings in Birmingham...

01:25:26.472 --> 01:25:29.566
...during the '40s, '50s, '60s.

01:25:30.409 --> 01:25:32.673
<i>His nickname was Dynamite Bob and...</i>

01:25:33.813 --> 01:25:38.011
<i>...instead of being scared or worried
or concerned, he was proud of it.</i>

01:25:38.284 --> 01:25:41.947
<i>He didn't think that the police
would ever try him for anything.</i>

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:45.023
<i>He wore it like a badge of honor.
Dynamite Bob.</i>

01:25:45.458 --> 01:25:49.326
I saw Chambliss standing on the corner...

01:25:49.862 --> 01:25:53.491
...watching the excitement down
at the 16th Street Baptist Church.

01:25:53.966 --> 01:25:55.456
I remember saying to myself:

01:25:55.634 --> 01:25:58.660
"He's the firebug that's come back
to watch the fire. "

01:25:59.205 --> 01:26:01.435
This is the court room where...

01:26:02.742 --> 01:26:04.937
...Bob Chambliss was tried for...

01:26:05.111 --> 01:26:08.171
...killing four little girls
at the 16th Street Church bombing.

01:26:10.015 --> 01:26:14.509
The court room is arranged
exactly as it was at the trial.

01:26:16.622 --> 01:26:18.453
Bob Chambliss sat here.

01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:20.815
I sat here.

01:26:22.228 --> 01:26:25.527
Assistant Attorney General John Young
sat here...

01:26:25.965 --> 01:26:28.934
...and the Attorney General of Alabama,
Bill Baxley...

01:26:29.168 --> 01:26:31.227
...sat there, during the prosecution.

01:26:31.737 --> 01:26:34.570
Ever since the day it happened,
like I said, I had...

01:26:36.575 --> 01:26:39.135
...hoped that some day
I could be a part of...

01:26:39.345 --> 01:26:42.337
...solving or bringing the people
that did that to justice.

01:26:42.782 --> 01:26:46.445
In fact, this never has been mentioned
before, but I got this record...

01:26:46.519 --> 01:26:50.182
...shortly after that,
Joan Baez, who was one of my favorites.

01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:54.121
<i>And she had a song
called Birmingham Sunday.</i>

01:26:54.693 --> 01:26:57.821
And it mentioned four little girls and...

01:26:58.364 --> 01:27:01.925
...almost every morning of my life...

01:27:02.034 --> 01:27:04.935
...until I became Attorney General...

01:27:05.304 --> 01:27:08.000
<i>...I played that Joan Baez song
of Birmingham Sunday.</i>

01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:11.366
<i>In Birmingham, Alabama,
the trial of Robert Chambliss...</i>

01:27:11.477 --> 01:27:15.004
<i>...charged with the bombing
of a black church in 1963...</i>

01:27:15.147 --> 01:27:17.115
<i>...four young girls were killed.</i>

01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:20.183
<i>The defense finished today
and the case has gone to the jury.</i>

01:27:20.252 --> 01:27:22.220
In the FBI documents...

01:27:23.556 --> 01:27:27.253
...that were submitted,
from the Birmingham Field Office...

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:30.489
...in 1964 and 1965, to J. Edgar Hoover...

01:27:31.564 --> 01:27:35.227
...four men were identified as...

01:27:35.568 --> 01:27:38.128
...suspects by the FBI.

01:27:38.237 --> 01:27:40.330
According to the FBI, they had informers...

01:27:40.406 --> 01:27:42.704
...who said they'd gone to the church
that night.

01:27:42.775 --> 01:27:43.867
They were...

01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:47.870
...Bob Chambliss, Tommy Blantin Jr...

01:27:48.447 --> 01:27:50.938
...Bobby Frank Cherry and Herman Cash.

01:27:52.218 --> 01:27:53.845
Of those four...

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.618
...Baxley indicted only Chambliss...

01:27:57.056 --> 01:27:59.923
...because he felt he could make
the strongest case there.

01:28:00.359 --> 01:28:04.523
Still, by the time we got to trial
we had evidence that we couldn't use.

01:28:04.663 --> 01:28:06.597
We had people who wouldn't testify.

01:28:08.434 --> 01:28:10.493
It was an iffy case to win.

01:28:13.105 --> 01:28:17.405
I felt like we might ought to wait
because I felt like there were people...

01:28:17.643 --> 01:28:21.409
...that still might talk and I knew
that if we went to trial and lost...

01:28:22.114 --> 01:28:25.709
...and the case was marginal,
then they'd never be solved.

01:28:27.319 --> 01:28:30.652
I went to Chris McNair,
who, as I said, was a friend of mine and...

01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:35.718
...I told him that we'd gotten
about as far as we could go.

01:28:35.828 --> 01:28:39.559
And I said, "Chris, what would be your
desire as one of the...

01:28:40.432 --> 01:28:42.957
"... the victims, as the father of Denise?

01:28:43.769 --> 01:28:47.830
"Would you want us to go ahead with
an iffy case and run the risk of losing, or...

01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:50.705
"... wait and hope somebody'll
take it from here?"

01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:54.370
<i>Chris basically said if it wasn't done
in my term of office...</i>

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.448
<i>...he didn't think it would ever get done.</i>

01:28:56.515 --> 01:29:00.212
<i>Chris did one of the bravest things
that I've ever seen...</i>

01:29:00.452 --> 01:29:03.478
...anyone do, which was,
he went on the witness stand...

01:29:04.957 --> 01:29:06.754
...and they brought him...

01:29:08.827 --> 01:29:11.887
...the post-mortem photographs of Denise.

01:29:13.799 --> 01:29:14.993
And...

01:29:17.403 --> 01:29:21.430
<i>...because they wanted the jury
to see the loss of a parent...</i>

01:29:24.643 --> 01:29:27.043
It's one of the most riveting moments...

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:31.473
...I've ever witnessed in a court room,
or anywhere...

01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:35.183
...when the prosecutor presented...

01:29:36.522 --> 01:29:39.889
...those photographs to Chris and...

01:29:40.759 --> 01:29:42.624
...he didn't speak at first...

01:29:45.864 --> 01:29:48.094
...held out to him and he...

01:29:49.268 --> 01:29:52.669
...went back in his chair
as if he'd been hit...

01:29:52.771 --> 01:29:55.672
...a blow in the chest with a heavy mallet.

01:30:00.379 --> 01:30:03.507
With great calmness he said,
"That is my daughter...

01:30:03.682 --> 01:30:05.582
"... that is Denise McNair. "

01:30:07.519 --> 01:30:09.783
<i>I think the big break came when...</i>

01:30:10.089 --> 01:30:12.683
<i>...Chambliss' niece decided to talk.</i>

01:30:12.891 --> 01:30:17.055
<i>I'll never forget, I was sitting right behind
Art Haines Jr., Art Haines Sr...</i>

01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:19.026
...and Chambliss is between them.

01:30:19.131 --> 01:30:23.033
The old man looks over his shoulder
and sees this woman walking in...

01:30:23.302 --> 01:30:26.169
...and he turns and his attorneys
lean over to him...

01:30:26.238 --> 01:30:28.502
...and ask him, "Who is that?"

01:30:29.441 --> 01:30:32.376
And it's clear they're totally unprepared
for this witness.

01:30:32.845 --> 01:30:35.871
<i>This small woman with a cross,
she was a Methodist minister...</i>

01:30:35.948 --> 01:30:39.543
<i>...she walked up on that stand
and she put that man in prison that day.</i>

01:30:39.718 --> 01:30:42.653
The gist of her testimony was this...

01:30:42.988 --> 01:30:44.080
...that...

01:30:44.723 --> 01:30:48.022
...in the days leading up to that bombing...

01:30:48.127 --> 01:30:50.823
...she opened a door
in the back of his house...

01:30:51.063 --> 01:30:54.829
...and walked in and saw dynamite
and he berated her fiercely...

01:30:55.734 --> 01:30:57.201
...for doing that.

01:30:58.203 --> 01:30:59.568
And then...

01:31:01.106 --> 01:31:05.042
...they were talking about the events
in Birmingham and he was enraged...

01:31:05.144 --> 01:31:07.112
...because he had read...

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:10.780
...in the paper, I think,
about a black woman...

01:31:10.949 --> 01:31:14.851
...or a white woman being assaulted
by a black man on a bus or something...

01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:19.116
...I've forgotten the details.
This twisted him into a rage as she told it.

01:31:19.358 --> 01:31:22.953
And he said,
"Wait until Sunday and they'll beg us...

01:31:23.362 --> 01:31:25.277
"... to segregate again. "

01:31:25.411 --> 01:31:27.106
The night before...

01:31:29.548 --> 01:31:32.108
...we finished arguing the case to the jury.

01:31:33.819 --> 01:31:37.380
I started the arguments after lunch...

01:31:38.591 --> 01:31:40.582
...and I got back from lunch...

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.190
...and one of my assistants, John Young...

01:31:44.530 --> 01:31:48.557
...called me up there, I was trying to get
my thoughts collected for the argument.

01:31:49.268 --> 01:31:52.066
I didn't want to be bothered.
He said, "Look at this. "

01:31:52.805 --> 01:31:56.798
<i>One of the exhibits was the death
certificate for Denise McNair.</i>

01:31:57.142 --> 01:32:00.509
<i>He says, "Look at this. " That day...</i>

01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:02.875
<i>...was Denise's birthday.</i>

01:32:03.015 --> 01:32:06.075
<i>In my final argument, I closed by...</i>

01:32:06.719 --> 01:32:09.882
<i>...telling him that
by some accident of fate...</i>

01:32:10.522 --> 01:32:13.150
<i>...that this day was Denise's birthday.</i>

01:32:13.259 --> 01:32:17.195
<i>Then I went in that had it not been
for this act that...</i>

01:32:17.529 --> 01:32:20.657
<i>...there'd probably be a party
over at the McNair's house...</i>

01:32:20.933 --> 01:32:24.300
...maybe with some little grandchildren
and that bit.

01:32:24.403 --> 01:32:27.600
I closed by saying, "Give Denise...

01:32:28.073 --> 01:32:30.974
"... a birthday present,
bring her killer to justice. "

01:32:31.243 --> 01:32:34.906
It wasn't too long, the next morning,
after the jury came back...

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.913
...and I was on the phone
when the jury came in...

01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:41.080
...and I heard the verdict of guilty.

01:32:41.387 --> 01:32:43.446
I just said a prayer of thanksgiving.

01:32:44.456 --> 01:32:46.117
<i>Chambliss was...</i>

01:32:46.792 --> 01:32:50.626
<i>...the most pathological racist
I have ever encountered.</i>

01:32:51.196 --> 01:32:54.393
<i>He was a chilling character.
I visited him twice in prison.</i>

01:32:55.334 --> 01:32:57.768
He named to me four other people...

01:32:58.170 --> 01:33:00.400
...that he said had planted the bomb.

01:33:00.606 --> 01:33:04.565
They were people I knew by name
to be associated with the Klan.

01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:07.635
He began to spring a long narrative.

01:33:07.913 --> 01:33:09.972
Spin a long narrative about these people.

01:33:10.082 --> 01:33:12.949
And he described how these people
by his allegation...

01:33:13.419 --> 01:33:15.910
...had gone to a place
on 3rd Avenue West...

01:33:16.055 --> 01:33:19.491
...and phoned in a phony bomb tip
to pull the police away.

01:33:19.725 --> 01:33:23.286
Then he described the route they'd driven
to plant the bomb at the church.

01:33:23.762 --> 01:33:27.163
<i>He described how they'd driven over
by Birmingham Southern College...</i>

01:33:27.266 --> 01:33:31.168
<i>...and Arcadelphia Road
and Findlay Avenue to escape.</i>

01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:34.896
<i>I realized that as he was telling this...</i>

01:33:35.107 --> 01:33:38.474
<i>...he was telling me how they planted
the bomb that night.</i>

01:33:52.624 --> 01:33:57.254
<i>This is my favorite photograph of Denise
of all the many pictures I have of her.</i>

01:33:57.930 --> 01:34:00.899
<i>And, well...</i>

01:34:01.166 --> 01:34:04.693
...I would say it's my favorite
because I think it's a good photograph.

01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:07.834
I made it with her little Brownie camera.

01:34:08.107 --> 01:34:12.203
And she was sitting in the bed
playing with her doll...

01:34:12.678 --> 01:34:16.705
...and said, "Make a picture of me, Daddy. "
And I said, "With this camera?"

01:34:16.815 --> 01:34:21.081
"With my camera. "
I did it, and it was a flashbulb.

01:34:21.687 --> 01:34:24.952
So, the distance that I was from her...

01:34:25.591 --> 01:34:27.115
...really was too close.

01:34:27.192 --> 01:34:30.719
But I made the picture because I wanted
to fill the frame up pretty good.

01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:33.595
When the film was developed...

01:34:33.932 --> 01:34:37.095
...I saw that the negative
was way overexposed...

01:34:37.202 --> 01:34:40.365
...and I never worried about it anymore
until after she died.

01:34:40.506 --> 01:34:44.533
And I went back through the negatives
and I saw it again and I reduced it.

01:34:44.743 --> 01:34:49.146
And then I made a print of it
and I realized what a jewel I had.

01:34:49.448 --> 01:34:51.473
It wasn't God that brought
the bombing on.

01:34:51.583 --> 01:34:53.517
A lot of people would think, well...

01:34:53.786 --> 01:34:55.947
...God did this and God did that.

01:34:56.054 --> 01:35:00.718
Just like it's a god of good,
we have a god of evil too.

01:35:04.029 --> 01:35:06.327
It's no part of God, you know.

01:35:06.465 --> 01:35:10.458
When we realize that God has
our best interests and he has a plan...

01:35:11.437 --> 01:35:14.634
...for each one of us,
a plan that's good and not for evil...

01:35:14.907 --> 01:35:18.206
...then we can begin to come
and receive healing.

01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:22.076
A friend of mine who's a pastor said:

01:35:22.714 --> 01:35:25.547
"God has a will for everything, Maxine.

01:35:25.984 --> 01:35:29.784
"You just have to go with it
and you can't ask him why.

01:35:30.422 --> 01:35:33.585
"Because he has a divine plan
and you know that.

01:35:34.026 --> 01:35:35.687
"So don't ask.

01:35:35.794 --> 01:35:39.560
"Just, go on and do
what you know is right to do. "

01:35:40.632 --> 01:35:43.192
I worked hard not to feel...

01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:47.095
...anger and hatred.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.873
But...

01:35:50.742 --> 01:35:52.300
...I did.

01:35:53.345 --> 01:35:55.404
I just had to work on it.

01:35:55.747 --> 01:35:57.908
And I had to kind of...

01:35:59.117 --> 01:36:02.712
...keep my spirits up...

01:36:03.055 --> 01:36:04.647
...so that I could...

01:36:05.324 --> 01:36:07.952
...help my husband to keep his up.

01:36:09.495 --> 01:36:12.658
And you know, the other folk around me.

01:36:13.632 --> 01:36:15.623
And we had...

01:36:16.668 --> 01:36:19.603
...good friends and family...

01:36:20.539 --> 01:36:22.734
...who gave us a lot of support.

01:36:23.809 --> 01:36:26.539
And I just had to work with it and pray.

01:36:29.147 --> 01:36:32.810
Did it take a number of years for that
to happen, for you to arrive at that?

01:36:33.085 --> 01:36:37.681
Yes, gradually it came about because...

01:36:39.558 --> 01:36:42.550
...the hating of people wasn't going
to do me any good.

01:36:42.794 --> 01:36:45.888
It would hurt me worse
than it would them.

01:36:47.933 --> 01:36:51.061
I think I conquered it.

01:36:51.737 --> 01:36:54.570
Every now and then
it still comes out, though.

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.770
Not hatred, but anger.

01:36:58.277 --> 01:37:00.074
How does it come out?

01:37:01.413 --> 01:37:04.280
I don't know, different ways.

01:37:05.884 --> 01:37:07.909
That's a tricky question.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:10.716
I'm not trying to be Mike Wallace, now.

01:37:11.924 --> 01:37:15.553
<i>- Or Ed Bradley?
- Or Ed Bradley. I just want to...</i>

01:37:15.661 --> 01:37:18.596
I guess it's a question...

01:37:18.797 --> 01:37:21.561
...that deserves an answer, I guess.

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.498
You're asking me how does it come out?

01:37:24.636 --> 01:37:28.595
Sometimes it comes out in ways
that I'm not even conscious of.

01:37:28.974 --> 01:37:32.068
You know,
you're thinking about something and...

01:37:33.045 --> 01:37:35.878
...having the wrong thoughts
and something comes up...

01:37:35.981 --> 01:37:38.814
...and anger expresses itself.

01:37:39.685 --> 01:37:44.384
But I've tried to just put all of that
behind me and go on and live.

01:37:45.791 --> 01:37:49.989
Because in addition to that,
so many other things have happened.

01:37:51.063 --> 01:37:55.762
My husband is gone,
my three brothers, my sister...

01:37:56.535 --> 01:37:58.332
...my parents.

01:38:00.205 --> 01:38:03.470
And of course, I still have my kids,
my family.

01:38:03.909 --> 01:38:07.572
I have two. A son and a daughter.

01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.205
Three grandchildren...

01:38:10.315 --> 01:38:13.648
...and four great grandchildren.

01:38:14.686 --> 01:38:18.955
So, I have something
to be thankful for after all.
