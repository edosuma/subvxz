WEBVTT

00:02.530 --> 00:03.980
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...
Officer Luca?

00:04.180 --> 00:05.420
Yeah.
I'm your sister.

00:05.620 --> 00:06.490
My mom had
an affair years ago

00:06.690 --> 00:08.150
with a guy named Carl Luca.

00:08.350 --> 00:09.520
You want to go somewhere
and talk?

00:09.720 --> 00:11.590
Yeah.
You surf, also?

00:11.790 --> 00:12.990
Where you go?
Malibu.

00:13.190 --> 00:15.130
What about you?
Redondo.

00:15.330 --> 00:18.260
Oof, we got a lot to talk about.

00:18.460 --> 00:20.000
I want to have
a family with you.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.300
(all shouting)
We-we-we're having a girl?

00:22.500 --> 00:23.900
Mm.
I'll toast to that.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.320
Here's to family.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.580
NICHELLE: (sighs)
I have two OIG meetings.

00:31.780 --> 00:34.310
Then I need to get over to the
community center to interview

00:34.510 --> 00:36.750
a new program director.
Baby.

00:36.950 --> 00:38.420
Baby, come on now.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.450
You've been going
so hard lately.

00:40.650 --> 00:41.920
I know you're trying
to get everything done

00:42.120 --> 00:43.890
before our little
baby girl gets here.

00:44.090 --> 00:45.360
But we got time.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.230
There's still
just so much to do.

00:47.430 --> 00:48.960
It is all gonna shake out.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.420
I think you could use a little
extra help slowing down.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.600
Oh.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.770
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

00:57.970 --> 00:58.770
(door opens)

00:58.970 --> 01:00.170
DANIEL:
Hey!

01:00.370 --> 01:02.040
What's all those boxes
in the backyard?

01:02.240 --> 01:03.680
Ain't you got the best
timing in the world, Pop?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.740
You texted me to come over.
Hey, darling.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.310
Hey.
Yeah, that was yesterday.

01:07.510 --> 01:08.650
We could've used
some extra hands.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.480
Well, I'm here now.
What do you need?

01:10.680 --> 01:12.250
Nichelle and I have been
doing some spring cleaning,

01:12.450 --> 01:14.290
getting ready for the baby,
so all the boxes in the back

01:14.490 --> 01:15.690
are what's left over
after we donated.

01:15.890 --> 01:17.560
But you didn't touch
the attic, though, right?

01:17.760 --> 01:19.630
Mm, yesterday.
Cleared it all out.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.930
You just up and donated

01:22.130 --> 01:23.630
all that stuff? Where?

01:23.830 --> 01:26.400
The big Goodwill center
on Western.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.430
You didn't even give me
a heads-up?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.800
Pop, what's going on with you?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.870
We'll talk later, Hondo.
You just got here, Pop.

01:34.070 --> 01:35.760
Pop!

01:40.330 --> 01:42.180
* *

01:42.380 --> 01:45.030
(indistinct chatter)

01:47.370 --> 01:49.670
No. No, I'm good. Thanks.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.240
Do you have what we asked for?

02:07.440 --> 02:09.010
I assume that's my money?

02:09.210 --> 02:12.030
Yes. We are men of our word.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.220
Can I get you guys
started with anything?

02:18.420 --> 02:20.170
Nothing, no. Go away.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.260
You said you had
what we asked for.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.130
This list isn't complete.

02:27.330 --> 02:28.890
It's mostly all there.

02:29.090 --> 02:31.160
You know what it took
to get just that?

02:31.360 --> 02:33.000
We asked for all of it.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.100
We're done here.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.070
Hey. Where are you going?

02:37.270 --> 02:39.100
I want my money!

02:39.310 --> 02:40.310
Hey!

02:40.510 --> 02:42.440
Give me the money or I'll shoot!

02:42.640 --> 02:44.760
(patrons gasp, yelp)

02:49.930 --> 02:50.950
Fine.

02:51.150 --> 02:53.040
Have your damn money.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.360
(shouting, clamoring)

03:00.560 --> 03:01.930
(gunshots echo)

03:02.130 --> 03:03.930
6-Adam-18.
We have multiple gunshots

03:04.130 --> 03:06.430
coming from Wyman Park Hotel,
corner of West 5th and Olive.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.020
Repeat, shots fired.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.560
(grunting)

03:22.060 --> 03:24.280
Cops are here.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.850
Take the list and go.

03:26.050 --> 03:27.640
Finish the job.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.840
(groans)

03:39.520 --> 03:41.930
Um, they're just running
some tests, Dom.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.270
I'll probably be
out of here by tonight.

03:44.470 --> 03:46.210
You had a heart attack, Dad.
Stop trying to play it down.

03:46.410 --> 03:47.410
It was mild.

03:47.610 --> 03:49.010
If I knew it took
a heart attack

03:49.210 --> 03:51.610
to get you to visit,
I'd have had one sooner.

03:51.810 --> 03:52.950
LUCA: Yeah, don't joke
like that. This is serious.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.910
Oh. Excuse me for making light,

03:55.110 --> 03:56.880
but I feel like
we hardly see you anymore.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.650
I've just been really busy
with work and the food truck.

03:59.850 --> 04:01.390
So you keep saying.

04:01.590 --> 04:02.660
I mean,
the streets must be filled

04:02.860 --> 04:04.420
with hungry criminals
these days.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.830
I'm really sorry, all right?

04:07.030 --> 04:09.730
Just got a lot going on.
It's complicated.

04:09.930 --> 04:12.370
Cardio lab's ready for you,
Mr. Luca.

04:12.570 --> 04:14.970
Yeah, see what I mean?
There's never enough tests.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.600
(grunts)
Look.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.640
Don't let him punk you, okay?
This guy's a terrible patient,

04:19.840 --> 04:22.020
but he's a good guy.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.890
All right.

04:28.930 --> 04:30.280
God, I hate seeing
him like this.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.640
He's right about you
not coming around, though.

04:34.470 --> 04:37.120
So, what's her name?

04:37.320 --> 04:39.490
What? Who?

04:39.690 --> 04:41.430
The new lady in your life.

04:41.630 --> 04:43.230
It's been a while,

04:43.430 --> 04:45.200
but I know the pattern.
We stop

04:45.400 --> 04:47.830
seeing you. You make excuses,
usually about work...
No.

04:48.030 --> 04:49.600
Mom, it's not like that,
I swear.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.600
Well, something's going on.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.810
Look, Dominique,

04:54.010 --> 04:55.570
whatever it is,
your father needs family

04:55.770 --> 04:56.980
more than ever right now.

04:57.180 --> 05:00.210
And with Terry chasing
his girlfriend up to Oregon,

05:00.410 --> 05:01.550
you and I are all he has.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.120
Okay.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.750
I'll try to come around more,
I promise.

05:05.950 --> 05:07.720
We're getting older.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.860
And listen to me
when I say this:

05:10.060 --> 05:13.330
You don't want to look up
and wish you had more time.

05:13.530 --> 05:14.860
(phone beeping)

05:15.060 --> 05:18.080
Okay, I got to go, Mom. Sorry.

05:19.010 --> 05:21.430
Just think about what I said.

05:21.630 --> 05:23.820
Yeah.

05:27.690 --> 05:30.260
(indistinct radio chatter)

05:31.190 --> 05:33.910
Luca, how's your pops?

05:34.110 --> 05:36.010
He's doing okay. Still,
hate that he's getting old.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.680
You sure you're up for this?
Hell yeah, man.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.050
Beats thinking about what-ifs.
What do we got?

05:40.250 --> 05:41.750
Gun battle popped off inside.
Conflicting reports,

05:41.950 --> 05:43.090
but it sounds like
we've still got two shooters.

05:43.290 --> 05:44.960
Witnesses say
both sides took hits.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.560
Most of the diners got out,
but we still got a few inside.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.880
Okay. What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

06:07.530 --> 06:08.450
DEACON:
Cabrera, get on our six.

06:08.650 --> 06:10.100
Eyes on that door.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.050
Hold it.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.640
Deacon.

06:18.740 --> 06:21.140
It's one of our shooters.

06:23.750 --> 06:24.930
He's dead.

06:25.130 --> 06:26.370
STREET:
Hondo?

06:26.570 --> 06:27.630
We've got a blood trail.

06:27.830 --> 06:28.970
Could be the other shooter.

06:29.170 --> 06:31.950
Going into the kitchen. Ready?

06:34.460 --> 06:36.690
* *

06:52.610 --> 06:54.210
STREET (quietly):
Lights off.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.540
STREET: LAPD!
Drop the gun!

07:02.740 --> 07:04.640
BAJWA: Don't
come any closer!

07:04.840 --> 07:06.910
(woman whimpering, panting)

07:07.110 --> 07:08.940
Come on, man.
There's nowhere to go.

07:09.140 --> 07:11.940
And you look like you need
some help, so how about

07:12.140 --> 07:13.780
you release her, and we get
you some medical attention?

07:13.980 --> 07:15.880
No! You need to get out!

07:16.080 --> 07:16.920
Hondo, we've got no angle here.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.550
HONDO:
I'm on my way.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.700
You need to back away,
or I'll kill her!

07:24.870 --> 07:28.230
(woman whimpering)
Listen up, man. It's over.

07:28.430 --> 07:30.260
Put down the weapon.
(Woman breathing heavily)

07:30.460 --> 07:35.120
Get me out of here,
or she dies, you hear me?!

07:37.950 --> 07:39.810
(two gunshots,
woman gasps loudly)

07:40.010 --> 07:41.560
(woman panting)

07:42.530 --> 07:44.710
(gasps loudly)
You're okay, you're okay.

07:44.910 --> 07:46.580
Get her out of here!
(woman wheezing)

07:46.780 --> 07:48.280
Let's go.
Let's get you out of here.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.480
20-David to Command.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.170
Code 4.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.660
Good job.

07:56.860 --> 07:59.040
(overlapping chatter)

08:01.880 --> 08:04.130
HONDO:
What do you got, Deac?

08:04.330 --> 08:06.230
You ready for this? Our shooter
is an Indian national.

08:06.430 --> 08:08.000
Soon as RHD
ran his prints,

08:08.200 --> 08:09.540
it triggered
an Interpol Red Notice.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.040
The guy's wanted for more
than a dozen assassinations

08:11.240 --> 08:12.670
across the Middle East
and North Africa.

08:12.870 --> 08:14.370
Contract killer.
CABRERA: And he's
not working alone.

08:14.570 --> 08:16.410
Waitress said for certain
he arrived with a partner.

08:16.610 --> 08:18.610
Guy fled out the back
when the shooting started.

08:18.810 --> 08:19.950
What about the shooter
we found dead?

08:20.150 --> 08:21.380
His name is Mason Crowley.

08:21.580 --> 08:22.980
He's a former
military intelligence officer.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.720
According to the waitress,
they started arguing

08:24.920 --> 08:26.150
over a folder with
what looked like

08:26.350 --> 08:27.690
a list of names
and addresses.

08:27.890 --> 08:28.990
No sign of it now.

08:29.190 --> 08:30.460
But we did find
a briefcase full of cash.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.460
Had to be an exchange,
intel for money. We got

08:32.660 --> 08:35.530
to figure that the partner
made off with that folder.

08:35.730 --> 08:38.510
We got a dangerous hit man on
the loose in L.A. with a list.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.780
What happened here
was just the beginning.

08:42.820 --> 08:45.050
* *

09:20.090 --> 09:21.510
This gives a whole new meaning

09:21.710 --> 09:23.280
to the phrase "dine and dash."

09:23.480 --> 09:25.610
Where are we
with an ID on this guy?

09:25.810 --> 09:27.710
Well, nothing yet,
but DHS flagged him

09:27.910 --> 09:29.820
and five other
foreign nationals,

09:30.020 --> 09:31.420
including the shooter
we took down.

09:31.620 --> 09:32.920
Now, they entered the U.S.
yesterday.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.390
All on the same flight,
all with fake passports.

09:35.590 --> 09:37.160
And the guy we took down?
He's a known assassin.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.660
So there's a good chance
that his travel buddies

09:38.860 --> 09:40.190
are in the same line of work.
Great.

09:40.390 --> 09:42.090
We got a half a dozen killers
on a mission in L.A.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.960
What do we know
about this list they have?

09:44.160 --> 09:46.800
The waitress only
caught a glimpse, but

09:47.000 --> 09:48.470
I'm looking into
the guy who supplied it.

09:48.670 --> 09:49.870
He's an American--
Mason Crowley,

09:50.070 --> 09:51.940
former Naval
Intelligence officer.

09:52.140 --> 09:55.140
He was discharged about a year
ago for conduct unbecoming.

09:55.340 --> 09:56.510
Since then, he's
been consulting

09:56.710 --> 09:58.410
for various private
military companies.

09:58.610 --> 10:00.850
Newcastle Group,
Blackvine, Ambercaz Corporation.

10:01.050 --> 10:03.620
Which means he has access to a
lot of classified information.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.150
Yeah, and according
to his financials,

10:05.350 --> 10:06.450
he was hurting for money.

10:06.650 --> 10:08.450
He had over $100,000 in debt

10:08.650 --> 10:10.720
between casinos,
online gambling platforms,

10:10.920 --> 10:12.490
which would explain
the briefcase full of cash.

10:12.690 --> 10:13.830
Oh, he's
selling secrets.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.430
He could have handed
over anything,

10:15.630 --> 10:17.430
from locations of
federal witnesses

10:17.630 --> 10:19.100
to high-ranking
government officials.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.370
We need to find these guys fast
before they strike again.

10:21.570 --> 10:22.770
May be too late for that.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.500
Patrol just called in
a murder in Highland Park.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.510
Witnesses saw two men
fleeing the scene,

10:27.710 --> 10:29.610
one matching the description
of our suspect.

10:29.810 --> 10:31.240
The victim, Koss Matias,

10:31.440 --> 10:33.410
was a retired Army Ranger.

10:33.610 --> 10:35.010
His wife found him
zip-tied in the garage.

10:35.210 --> 10:37.050
First responders think he was
tortured before he was killed.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.680
HICKS:
All right,

10:38.880 --> 10:40.220
let's try to bring the wife in.

10:40.420 --> 10:41.520
Maybe she knows something
that can help us figure out

10:41.720 --> 10:43.910
what the hell is going on.

10:48.580 --> 10:49.730
DURANT:
Luca.

10:49.930 --> 10:52.000
I just heard.
Some of the old-timers

10:52.200 --> 10:54.730
at the 27th were talking.
A heart attack?

10:54.930 --> 10:56.740
Yeah. But, look,
he's gonna pull through, though.

10:56.940 --> 10:58.640
I went and saw him this morning.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.170
So he's alive?
Yeah.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.740
(sighs heavily)

11:02.940 --> 11:04.810
You know cops and the rumor
mill. I heard more than once

11:05.010 --> 11:06.440
that he didn't make it.
Nah, he'll be fine.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.180
He's just got to take better
care of himself, that's all.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.970
(exhales) Good.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.590
'Cause I want
to meet him.

11:14.790 --> 11:16.990
Wait. What?

11:17.190 --> 11:19.260
I thought you didn't
want anything to do with him.

11:19.460 --> 11:23.080
That was before I thought I lost
my chance to get to know him.

11:23.910 --> 11:26.630
Maybe we should just
hold off a beat.

11:26.830 --> 11:28.400
Okay? There's a lot
of moving pieces.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.200
I know it's a big ask, Luca.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.570
But I keep thinking
about what Terry said

11:32.770 --> 11:34.570
about my mom going to your house
three years ago.

11:34.770 --> 11:37.180
She wanted me
to know our dad.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.380
I already lost her.

11:39.580 --> 11:42.180
(sighs)

11:42.380 --> 11:45.420
I just don't think
it's a good time right now.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.540
I'm sorry.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.890
I guess I didn't...

11:53.090 --> 11:55.430
realize that
your idea of family...

11:55.630 --> 11:57.810
had limits.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.180
I can't imagine who would want
to hurt Koss,

12:11.380 --> 12:12.750
and like this.

12:12.950 --> 12:15.780
Well, that's why we've asked
you to come in, Mrs. Matias.

12:15.980 --> 12:18.450
We're hoping you can
help us figure that out.

12:18.650 --> 12:21.050
I can't imagine how.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.240
Did your husband have
any enemies?

12:24.240 --> 12:26.090
No.

12:26.290 --> 12:28.130
Koss was a gentle soul.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.830
In fact,
the last argument

12:30.030 --> 12:31.960
we had was when I asked him

12:32.160 --> 12:34.630
to retire
from the Army five years ago.

12:34.830 --> 12:37.940
Yeah, that kind of rush
must be hard to give up.

12:38.140 --> 12:40.070
For some vets.

12:40.270 --> 12:42.710
I mean, you hear the stories
of guys who retire

12:42.910 --> 12:46.140
and get into trouble 'cause
they can't let go of the high.

12:46.340 --> 12:48.130
That wasn't Koss.

12:49.130 --> 12:51.050
He was happy.

12:51.250 --> 12:54.750
Spent most of his time
volunteering. (sniffles)

12:54.950 --> 12:56.490
Do you know
if Koss knew of a man

12:56.690 --> 12:58.520
by the name of Mason Crowley?

12:58.720 --> 13:00.130
Hmm.

13:00.330 --> 13:03.230
No, the name doesn't
sound familiar.

13:03.430 --> 13:05.500
But Koss had a lot of friends.

13:05.700 --> 13:08.750
He kept in touch
with his old Army buddies.

13:09.650 --> 13:11.040
They had this camping group

13:11.240 --> 13:13.270
that would travel
a couple times a year.

13:13.470 --> 13:15.970
He always uploaded
the photos.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.260
He was pretty proud
of his adventures.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.450
Do you mind
if I text this to myself?

13:25.650 --> 13:27.840
It might help us.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.490
Mrs. Matias, uh,

13:30.690 --> 13:33.160
your husband was
found in the garage.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.030
But you told the police

13:35.230 --> 13:37.660
that you think maybe the
killers had been in the house?

13:37.860 --> 13:39.360
In his study?

13:39.560 --> 13:42.230
Do you have any idea what
they might've been looking for?

13:42.430 --> 13:44.040
No,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.570
but they took his phone
and his laptop.

13:46.770 --> 13:49.570
(sniffles) All these years,
I was so worried

13:49.770 --> 13:51.740
about him when he was overseas,

13:51.940 --> 13:54.360
risking his life
for our country.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.800
I finally convince him
to retire.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.720
And he ends up
getting killed

14:00.920 --> 14:03.320
in our home.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.520
(cries) Oh.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.630
Hey. Check out the shield
on Koss's cap.

14:09.830 --> 14:11.730
I've seen that
emblem before.

14:11.930 --> 14:13.870
It belongs to Ambercaz.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.570
It's one of the private
military companies

14:15.770 --> 14:17.370
Mason Crowley consulted for.

14:17.570 --> 14:20.410
So maybe Koss wasn't as retired
as his wife thinks he was.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.080
Either way, Ambercaz--
that might be the link.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.930
Yeah.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.610
Yeah, I'm familiar
with Ambercaz.

14:28.810 --> 14:30.980
They're a goodwill PMC.

14:31.180 --> 14:33.190
They specialize in rescue,
peacekeeping missions

14:33.390 --> 14:36.050
that our government
can't or won't touch.
Yeah.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.920
Apparently, they were behind the
evacuation of those journalists

14:38.120 --> 14:39.560
in Ukraine a couple months ago.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.890
All right, so we know

14:41.090 --> 14:42.430
Mason Crowley did a
stint with Ambercaz.

14:42.630 --> 14:44.200
You think Matias was
working with them, as well?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.630
As a field operator, yeah.
That's the running theory.

14:46.830 --> 14:48.430
But given their line of work,

14:48.630 --> 14:51.350
it's gonna be hard to confirm
that without a contact.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.120
I think I may know
someone who works there.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.240
I haven't talked to
him in years, though.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.110
There some... bad blood?

15:01.310 --> 15:04.150
Well, his father and I were
partners back in my patrol days.

15:04.350 --> 15:06.620
Yeah, we grew to be
like brothers.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.620
That's until I found
out he stole money

15:08.820 --> 15:10.420
from several drug
busts we worked,

15:10.620 --> 15:14.460
and, you know, I asked him
to come clean, turn himself in.

15:14.660 --> 15:16.260
He refused.

15:16.460 --> 15:18.030
So you reported him
to Internal Affairs?

15:18.230 --> 15:19.630
He ended up getting
kicked off the force

15:19.830 --> 15:21.070
and spiraled from there.

15:21.270 --> 15:24.440
He... he eventually
drank himself to death.

15:24.640 --> 15:25.840
You think the son blames you?

15:26.040 --> 15:27.610
Well, his mother did.

15:27.810 --> 15:28.940
I mean, she told
me at the funeral

15:29.140 --> 15:30.810
that I killed her husband.

15:31.010 --> 15:32.810
The kid saw the whole thing.

15:33.010 --> 15:35.880
I was close with him
back then, but that day,

15:36.080 --> 15:38.250
the look in his eyes--

15:38.450 --> 15:40.240
everything changed.

15:41.970 --> 15:43.820
Commander, maybe
I should talk to him instead.

15:44.020 --> 15:45.820
No. I'm not hiding
behind you.

15:46.020 --> 15:47.690
We need intel,
I'm gonna reach out.

15:47.890 --> 15:49.190
I'm not gonna let
my personal business

15:49.390 --> 15:51.780
jeopardize the
people of this city.

15:59.950 --> 16:01.670
Yeah. Hello.
HONDO:
Pop,

16:01.870 --> 16:03.040
I've been trying you.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.480
I wanted to check in
about this morning.

16:04.680 --> 16:05.810
You left the house in a hurry.

16:06.010 --> 16:07.410
Yeah, well, I've been busy.

16:07.610 --> 16:09.210
I've been at the donation center
all morning

16:09.410 --> 16:10.720
trying to get back what
you threw away so carelessly.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.480
Pop, come on now.
That junk up in the attic

16:12.680 --> 16:13.990
hasn't been touched in 30 years.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.620
What's so important now?

16:15.820 --> 16:17.190
Junk, huh?
Well, obviously,

16:17.390 --> 16:18.720
somebody thought
it was valuable,

16:18.920 --> 16:20.060
'cause it ain't here.

16:20.260 --> 16:21.660
Somebody bought it all
for pennies.

16:21.860 --> 16:22.930
(scoffs)
After all the time I spent...

16:23.130 --> 16:24.360
Oh, come on, Pop.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.100
What is this about?

16:26.300 --> 16:27.500
Nothing.

16:27.700 --> 16:28.800
You have a good day, son.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.290
(call clicks off)
Pop. Pop?

16:33.720 --> 16:36.290
(door opens)

16:37.460 --> 16:40.010
Well, a visit

16:40.210 --> 16:41.550
from the man himself.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.020
Long time, Aaron.

16:43.220 --> 16:45.150
Yeah.
It's good to see you.

16:45.350 --> 16:46.680
How's your mom doing these days?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.320
Oh, yeah. She's okay.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.510
Lives on her own,
keeps busy with the grandkids.

16:51.670 --> 16:52.890
What's it been,

16:53.090 --> 16:54.530
30 years since you
and my father ran the streets?

16:54.730 --> 16:55.690
(scoffs)
Yeah.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.100
Figured you'd be retired by now.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.430
Ah.

16:58.630 --> 17:00.170
I'm not quite finished
with the badge yet.

17:00.370 --> 17:03.700
I still got a few more years
left in me.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.190
Hmm.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.440
Got the names you sent over.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.070
Hmm.

17:09.270 --> 17:11.980
I can confirm that both Crowley
and Matias worked for Ambercaz,

17:12.180 --> 17:14.010
but that's about it.
Mm-hmm.

17:14.210 --> 17:17.220
There was, uh,
no overlap in their roles.

17:17.420 --> 17:20.820
Crowley was in analytics,
Matias was a field guy.
Ah.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.850
They were both killed
by the same people.

17:23.050 --> 17:25.090
One was tortured.

17:25.290 --> 17:26.960
There's got to be more to it.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.590
Well, that's all
I'm authorized to share.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.030
The rest is classified.

17:30.230 --> 17:33.370
Then get it declassified.
Lives are at risk.

17:33.570 --> 17:34.880
Well, it's not up to me.

17:35.620 --> 17:38.170
Look, Ambercaz is conducting
its own investigation.

17:38.370 --> 17:40.140
If we come up with anything
pertinent to the LAPD,

17:40.340 --> 17:42.970
we'll share it with you.
All due respect,

17:43.180 --> 17:45.540
I need information
that I can act on now.

17:45.740 --> 17:47.380
I'm just abiding
by the protocol.

17:47.580 --> 17:50.780
Well, it feels more like
you're stonewalling me.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.380
(laughs)
Come on, Bob.

17:52.580 --> 17:54.190
It's not personal.

17:54.390 --> 17:55.790
But I do find it ironic

17:55.990 --> 17:58.090
that you're asking <i>me</i>
to color outside the lines,

17:58.290 --> 18:00.230
given your track record.
Because, as I remember,

18:00.430 --> 18:02.790
you're a stickler for the rules.
Hmm.

18:02.990 --> 18:05.110
(door opens)

18:06.350 --> 18:08.300
I have a meeting, Commander.
I can assure you

18:08.500 --> 18:10.340
that Ambercaz will contact every
operative with a connection

18:10.540 --> 18:13.140
to Koss Matias
and give 'em a heads up.

18:13.340 --> 18:15.470
Hmm.
If you don't mind...

18:15.670 --> 18:17.530
(scoffs)

18:19.430 --> 18:22.450
KEVIN: Three tours,
I lose my arm in a car accident.

18:22.650 --> 18:24.050
Go figure.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.520
You're doing
a great job, Kevin.
(phone dings)

18:26.720 --> 18:27.850
I can get that.

18:28.050 --> 18:30.270
No. Let me.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.060
Pack up. We're
done for today.

18:34.260 --> 18:36.440
Kevin, what's going on?

18:38.610 --> 18:39.660
(dialing, line ringing)

18:39.860 --> 18:41.030
WOMAN:
911. What's your emergency?

18:41.230 --> 18:42.230
My name is Kevin Grayson.

18:42.430 --> 18:43.770
There's two guys here with guns.

18:43.970 --> 18:45.200
I think they want to kill me.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.610
My address is
137 Liberty Street. Hurry!

18:48.810 --> 18:51.280
Change of plans, Patty.
Safer if you hole up here.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.300
What's going on?

18:56.930 --> 18:59.170
(siren wailing)

19:02.770 --> 19:05.070
* *

19:10.980 --> 19:12.360
What do we got?

19:12.560 --> 19:14.030
Two shooters on
the second floor.

19:14.230 --> 19:15.770
Asian
or Southeast Asian descent.

19:15.970 --> 19:18.240
We got 'em pinned in an alcove,
but we're seriously outgunned.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.840
They got
automatic weapons

19:20.040 --> 19:21.340
sporting
high-capacity drum mags.

19:21.540 --> 19:22.710
Nothing we could do
but hold 'em.

19:22.910 --> 19:24.080
All right, you did your job.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.410
We got it from here.

19:25.610 --> 19:26.940
Sounds like our guys.
Coincidence?

19:27.140 --> 19:28.350
No such thing.
Deacon, with me.

19:28.550 --> 19:31.570
The rest, you know
what to do.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.850
Officers, get up out of here.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.110
We got this.
Thanks, boys.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.630
This is LAPD SWAT!
You got no way out of here!

19:44.830 --> 19:47.430
Throw down your weapons
and come out, hands raised.

19:47.630 --> 19:49.380
Cover!

19:50.050 --> 19:51.520
Street, can you give me eyes?

19:55.760 --> 19:57.610
Two suspects, ducked

19:57.810 --> 19:58.880
in a dead-end alcove.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.510
Both heavily armed.
HONDO: Copy that.

20:00.710 --> 20:03.500
Street, ready flashbangs.
Luca, corner shot.

20:06.970 --> 20:08.150
22-David in position.

20:08.350 --> 20:09.750
Corner shot is ready, boss.

20:09.950 --> 20:11.190
This is your last chance!

20:11.390 --> 20:13.410
Drop your guns and come out!

20:15.910 --> 20:17.450
(grunts)

20:18.410 --> 20:19.400
(loud boom)
(yells)

20:19.600 --> 20:21.150
Deacon, move.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.470
Drop it!

20:23.670 --> 20:24.790
(grunts)

20:28.360 --> 20:30.740
Suspects one and two down.

20:30.940 --> 20:32.580
Hey. This is the 911 caller.

20:32.780 --> 20:33.800
I'm on it.

20:34.730 --> 20:37.050
This is Sergeant Kay, LAPD.
Open the door, please.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.920
We need help in here!

20:39.120 --> 20:40.990
It's Kevin. He's shot!

20:41.190 --> 20:43.710
22-David. We need
an R/A up here now.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.060
Zip ties.

20:47.260 --> 20:48.230
Maybe they wanted

20:48.430 --> 20:50.090
to take
Grayson alive,

20:50.290 --> 20:52.900
torture him
like they did Koss Matias?
And check this out.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.030
This must be the list
they paid for.

20:55.230 --> 20:56.330
Names and addresses.

20:56.530 --> 20:59.070
Matias, Grayson
and three others.

20:59.270 --> 21:00.710
There's a sixth name on here,

21:00.910 --> 21:02.370
but the info's
blacked out, redacted.
That's probably

21:02.570 --> 21:03.640
why they tortured Matias,
and why

21:03.840 --> 21:05.110
they planned
to torture the victim here.

21:05.310 --> 21:06.640
To get the sixth name.
All right.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.310
We'll get the three names
we can read into protection.

21:08.510 --> 21:10.080
But there are still
three assassins out there.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.780
We got to find out
who this sixth name is

21:11.980 --> 21:14.470
before the hit men,
or they're as good as dead.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.090
Came as soon as I heard.

21:23.290 --> 21:25.360
I'm Aaron Skinner.
I'm with Ambercaz.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.730
Sergeant Harrelson.

21:26.930 --> 21:28.530
We owe you a huge
thanks, Sergeant--

21:28.730 --> 21:31.200
you, too, Commander-- for saving
Kevin Grayson's life today.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.270
An apartment building full
of citizens were terrorized,

21:34.470 --> 21:35.910
young officer was shot.

21:36.110 --> 21:37.310
All of which
could've been avoided

21:37.510 --> 21:38.810
if you came clean with me

21:39.010 --> 21:40.750
in your office earlier.
HONDO:
We checked out

21:40.950 --> 21:42.410
the five names from a list
found on one of the hit men.

21:42.610 --> 21:43.820
They're all former soldiers.

21:44.020 --> 21:45.680
And I'm willing to bet
they all work for Ambercaz.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.020
Now we need to know

21:47.220 --> 21:48.720
what connects these five
with the assassins

21:48.920 --> 21:50.150
running around my city.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.520
And don't tell me
it's classified.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.990
Well, it is classified.
(scoffs)

21:54.190 --> 21:55.430
But I talked to my bosses,
convinced them

21:55.630 --> 21:57.230
to share one
of our mission files with you.

21:57.430 --> 21:58.600
I'm sending it now.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.530
(phone chimes)

22:00.730 --> 22:01.870
(computer trills)

22:02.070 --> 22:04.800
The five men on the
list were all part

22:05.000 --> 22:07.070
of an Ambercaz mission
led by Koss Matias

22:07.270 --> 22:09.340
to the India-Pakistan
border six months ago.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.340
They were tasked
with taking out Dinesh Reddy,

22:11.540 --> 22:13.450
the leader of a Southeast Asian
crime organization

22:13.650 --> 22:15.450
called "The Brotherhood-Defense
Movement," B.D.M. for short.

22:15.650 --> 22:16.780
Yeah, I heard about them.

22:16.980 --> 22:18.220
They were behind
a dirty bomb

22:18.420 --> 22:19.820
at a U.S. base
in Qatar last year.

22:20.020 --> 22:21.820
And a shelling
of a boarding school in Myanmar.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.720
Yeah, they operate
primarily in the shadows,

22:23.920 --> 22:25.120
planning and funding

22:25.320 --> 22:27.590
global acts of terror.
Matias and his men

22:27.790 --> 22:29.430
took out the entire
B.D.M. compound.

22:29.630 --> 22:32.460
Dinesh, his generals and
his acolytes, including his wife

22:32.660 --> 22:34.150
and adult sons.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.730
That woman.

22:36.930 --> 22:38.570
We've seen her.

22:38.770 --> 22:40.340
Arjet Reddy?
That's Dinesh's wife,

22:40.540 --> 22:42.070
second in command.
She was killed in the raid.

22:42.270 --> 22:43.790
Ah...

22:45.060 --> 22:47.710
Facts say otherwise.
Arjet entered

22:47.910 --> 22:49.680
the U.S. yesterday,
along with the other hit men.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.550
She survived.

22:51.750 --> 22:52.980
Well, she's got
to be the one

22:53.180 --> 22:54.650
orchestrating these
attacks, wanting revenge

22:54.850 --> 22:56.190
for the death
of her husband and sons.

22:56.390 --> 22:58.120
There's a sixth name on
that list that's redacted.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.220
And the killers seem hell-bent
on finding that identity.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.930
Wasn't one of our operatives,
but I'll see what I can do.

23:03.130 --> 23:04.430
That's not good enough.

23:04.630 --> 23:06.300
We need that
name, Aaron.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.080
Can you get it or not?

23:09.150 --> 23:11.570
I just said I will look into it.

23:11.770 --> 23:14.220
That's the best
I can do for now.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.780
Deacon told me about
your shared past,

23:20.980 --> 23:23.900
the stuff that went down
with his father and IA?

23:24.700 --> 23:26.020
Yeah.

23:26.220 --> 23:27.890
I was like an uncle to Aaron
when he was a kid,

23:28.090 --> 23:29.520
before it all went bad.

23:29.720 --> 23:32.860
(chuckles)
I spent every weekend
one summer

23:33.060 --> 23:35.410
building him a treehouse.

23:36.710 --> 23:39.630
Maybe he is being genuine
and doing all he can.

23:39.830 --> 23:41.270
What are you saying?

23:41.470 --> 23:43.640
I made the wrong call
applying pressure?

23:43.840 --> 23:48.290
No, sir. I'm just reminding you
we don't have all the context.

23:54.930 --> 23:58.920
Hey. Kevin Grayson's wounds are
patched up, he's headed to HQ.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.720
Hicks wants us to talk to
him as soon as he gets here.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.050
Cool.
Yeah.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.660
Let me know
when he arrives.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.520
Luca...

24:06.720 --> 24:08.890
All right.

24:09.090 --> 24:10.360
What's going on, man?

24:10.560 --> 24:12.030
Nothing, all right?
Never better, man.

24:12.230 --> 24:15.500
Dude, we share
a house together.

24:15.700 --> 24:18.340
I know your snore pattern.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.320
Come on, cough it up.

24:21.220 --> 24:23.680
Eva wants to meet my father.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.780
She heard
that he had a heart attack,

24:25.980 --> 24:27.140
freaked her out a little bit.

24:27.340 --> 24:28.950
Now she wants me
to make an introduction.

24:29.150 --> 24:31.220
Okay. And that's bad?
Hell yeah, it's bad.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.450
It could blow everything up.
I mean, what if...?

24:33.650 --> 24:35.150
How's my mom gonna react

24:35.350 --> 24:37.050
when she finds out
that my dad had an affair?

24:37.250 --> 24:38.590
Okay? She's gonna be crushed.

24:38.790 --> 24:41.390
I can't just destroy
their marriage just like that,

24:41.590 --> 24:43.960
especially not now.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.400
So what are you gonna do?

24:46.600 --> 24:49.100
I mean, you had to know this was
coming sooner or later, right?

24:49.300 --> 24:52.200
I don't know. I can't just
keep avoiding my folks,

24:52.400 --> 24:55.910
but I can barely look 'em
in the eyes knowing what I know.

24:56.110 --> 24:58.210
It's like lose-lose,
no matter what, bro.

24:58.410 --> 24:59.940
Yeah. Look,

25:00.140 --> 25:03.720
I know what it is
to lose your parents

25:03.920 --> 25:05.920
and to not have any answers.

25:06.120 --> 25:09.190
And if I was your dad,
I think I'd want to know

25:09.390 --> 25:11.260
if I had a kid
out there.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.290
The way I see it,
you're robbing 'em both

25:13.490 --> 25:15.530
of an opportunity 'cause you're
afraid of what might happen.

25:15.730 --> 25:17.530
MAN:
Hey.

25:17.730 --> 25:19.160
Kevin Grayson's here.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.500
Okay. Let's not
keep him waiting.

25:22.700 --> 25:25.100
(sighs)

25:25.300 --> 25:27.000
I can't believe
they got Matias.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.010
I bet that son of a bitch
put up a hell of a fight.

25:29.210 --> 25:30.610
Look, these guys are still
on the loose.

25:30.810 --> 25:32.210
We could really use your help.

25:32.410 --> 25:33.650
I thought
you took care of 'em pretty well

25:33.850 --> 25:35.310
at my apartment.
Yeah.

25:35.510 --> 25:37.210
That was only two. There's still
three more of them out there.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.620
We think this is
about revenge

25:38.820 --> 25:41.220
for the Ambercaz mission
that took down B.D.M.

25:41.420 --> 25:43.250
The hit men at your
apartment-- they had a list

25:43.450 --> 25:45.860
with the names and addresses
of the five men in your unit.

25:46.060 --> 25:47.190
LUCA: The problem
is, there was

25:47.390 --> 25:49.430
a sixth name on the list,
but it was redacted.

25:49.630 --> 25:51.430
Do you have any idea
who that may be?

25:51.630 --> 25:53.700
I might.
I mean, Matias had a contact

25:53.900 --> 25:57.100
inside the B.D.M. compound,
someone serving us intel.

25:57.300 --> 25:58.870
We wouldn't have breached
without it.

25:59.070 --> 26:01.110
If this is about revenge,
it'd be them.

26:01.310 --> 26:04.210
Do you have a name?
No. Matias kept that to himself.

26:04.410 --> 26:06.480
But I do remember
a woman and her daughter.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.980
They hitched a ride with us on
our flight back to the States.

26:09.180 --> 26:10.720
Kid was pretty sick,

26:10.920 --> 26:12.580
needed oxygen.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.420
Matias actually held her
the whole way home.

26:14.620 --> 26:15.920
You think
Matias kept in contact?

26:16.120 --> 26:17.220
I wouldn't doubt it.

26:17.420 --> 26:18.790
He wasn't the type
to let a woman

26:18.990 --> 26:20.960
and a sick child get
swallowed up in a city like L.A.

26:21.160 --> 26:22.860
I'm sure he kept tabs on them.

26:23.060 --> 26:24.600
All right.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.000
Thanks.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.970
(line ringing)
Hey, babe. You got a minute?

26:28.170 --> 26:29.600
NICHELLE:
Actually, I do.

26:29.800 --> 26:33.500
You might be onto something
with this slowing-down business.

26:33.710 --> 26:36.640
See, I got me some good ideas
here and there.
(laughs)

26:36.840 --> 26:39.710
Look, I want to ask you
something about my father.

26:39.910 --> 26:41.280
Have you talked to him yet?

26:41.480 --> 26:43.380
I'm still confused by
that whole thing this morning.

26:43.580 --> 26:46.320
Yeah, I talked to him, but
I didn't get any kind of answer.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.890
But then,
something Commander Hicks said

26:48.090 --> 26:49.490
about trying to build
a treehouse jogged my memory.

26:49.690 --> 26:51.460
What do you mean?
Baby, do you remember seeing

26:51.660 --> 26:53.020
an old wooden dollhouse
among the things

26:53.220 --> 26:54.230
that we packed for donation?

26:54.430 --> 26:56.630
I remember a wooden castle

26:56.830 --> 26:58.200
kind of thing.

26:58.400 --> 27:01.000
(sighs) Baby, it started life
as a dollhouse.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.070
My Pops built it
for my sister Winnie

27:03.270 --> 27:04.800
when she was just a kid,
and it took him months.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.140
And then, when she outgrew it,

27:06.340 --> 27:07.740
he repurposed it
into a castle for me,

27:07.940 --> 27:09.070
even let me pick the paint.

27:09.270 --> 27:10.570
I called it "King Castle."

27:10.780 --> 27:13.410
So now,
with the baby on the way...

27:13.610 --> 27:16.510
He was probably planning
to repurpose it again for her.

27:16.710 --> 27:18.520
(sighs)
That's why it was so important,

27:18.720 --> 27:20.050
sitting in the attic
all these years,

27:20.250 --> 27:21.390
and I just threw it away.

27:21.590 --> 27:23.290
I'm sure if you talk to him,

27:23.490 --> 27:25.320
he'll understand
you didn't mean any harm.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.830
(sighs)
Niche, I don't know.
I was pretty rough on him.

27:29.030 --> 27:32.000
He was just trying to do
something special for our girl.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.030
I got to make this right.

27:34.230 --> 27:35.630
I love you, baby.

27:35.830 --> 27:37.480
I love you, too.

27:38.890 --> 27:39.840
(sighs)

27:40.040 --> 27:41.410
You got something for me?

27:41.610 --> 27:43.010
We checked back with
Heidi Matias and asked

27:43.210 --> 27:44.440
if her husband ever
came in contact

27:44.640 --> 27:46.080
with anyone
who matches the description

27:46.280 --> 27:47.380
of the woman
on the plane with a sick child.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.380
Turns out Matias
volunteered for Cupid's Bow,

27:49.580 --> 27:51.450
a charity for children
with serious heart defects.

27:51.650 --> 27:53.520
Heidi said he got involved
after meeting a woman

27:53.720 --> 27:55.620
named Mariam
and her ill daughter, Gia,

27:55.820 --> 27:57.120
shortly after one
of his camping trips.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.790
And we got this photo
from Mrs. Matias.

27:58.990 --> 28:01.830
The woman in the Green Raven
Cafe uniform-- that's Mariam.

28:02.030 --> 28:03.760
Now we think she's
the redacted name on the list.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.330
There was no one named Mariam
in the official mission data.

28:06.530 --> 28:09.000
But I'm combing through the new
intel we just got from Ambercaz.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.970
From Aaron Skinner?
Could be.

28:12.170 --> 28:14.070
It came
from an anonymous email.

28:14.270 --> 28:15.340
Well, I'm sure
that doesn't fall in line

28:15.540 --> 28:16.770
with Ambercaz's protocol.

28:16.970 --> 28:18.810
This file lists a woman
named "Tamia Ghosh."

28:19.010 --> 28:22.280
She was a maid inside the B.D.M.
compound, had a sick child.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.620
That sounds like the woman
on the plane to me.

28:24.820 --> 28:25.880
She helps out Matias,

28:26.080 --> 28:27.480
trades inside information
for a new life.

28:27.680 --> 28:30.090
Wait. The hit men stole
Matias's phone and laptop.

28:30.290 --> 28:32.460
If they have access
to Matias's photos...

28:32.660 --> 28:34.090
Then it's only a matter of time
before they figure out

28:34.290 --> 28:35.660
who and where Mariam is,
if they haven't already.

28:35.860 --> 28:37.230
I got a home address.

28:37.430 --> 28:40.250
Send patrol units there
and her place of work, now.

28:44.350 --> 28:46.500
(grunting, groaning)

28:46.700 --> 28:48.070
Where is Tamia?

28:48.270 --> 28:50.910
I don't know anyone
named Tamia!

28:51.110 --> 28:52.490
Tell us where she is now!

28:55.900 --> 28:57.210
(coughing)

28:57.410 --> 28:58.880
Let's not waste any more time.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.590
You know this woman.
She works here.

29:01.790 --> 29:04.270
If you don't want to die,
tell us where to find her.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.600
Sir, just got word
from Patrol.

29:12.800 --> 29:13.970
No sign of Mariam
at her apartment

29:14.170 --> 29:15.630
or the cafe where she works,

29:15.830 --> 29:17.300
but an employee there
got beaten

29:17.500 --> 29:19.040
within an inch of his life
taking out the trash.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.840
Couple of the other workers
found him unconscious.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.040
Well, that has to be the work

29:22.240 --> 29:23.670
of Arjet
and the other two hit men.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.210
If the poor bastard survived,
he must've said something.

29:25.410 --> 29:27.140
Do we have any idea what?
No.

29:27.340 --> 29:29.110
But one of
the other employees said

29:29.310 --> 29:31.280
that Mariam's daughter
is currently a patient

29:31.480 --> 29:32.920
at the Children's Hospital.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.450
Have to think,
if Mariam's not at home,

29:34.650 --> 29:35.950
and she's not at work...

29:36.150 --> 29:37.860
She's at the hospital
with the kid, which means

29:38.060 --> 29:39.390
that's where Arjet's
gonna be headed next.

29:39.590 --> 29:40.830
All right, I'll call over there

29:41.030 --> 29:43.080
and alert the hospital
while the team rolls.

29:50.620 --> 29:53.040
(alarm sounding)
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention.

29:53.240 --> 29:56.210
The hospital is initiating
emergency protocols.

29:56.410 --> 29:59.610
All visitors and non-essential
staff are instructed

29:59.810 --> 30:02.410
to exit immediately.

30:02.610 --> 30:04.220
(siren wailing)

30:04.420 --> 30:06.280
All right, listen up.
Hospital has seven floors.

30:06.480 --> 30:09.090
Mariam's daughter
is on the third, room 318.

30:09.290 --> 30:10.590
Now, when we land,
Deacon, Cabrera,

30:10.790 --> 30:12.060
you ascend the east stairwell.

30:12.260 --> 30:14.090
Luca, Street,
you're with me up the west.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.390
Now, the plan is
to trap and pinch. Got it?

30:16.590 --> 30:18.260
Copy that, boss.
Have us there in three.

30:18.460 --> 30:20.830
Great. Thank you. Hospital
security's already begun

30:21.030 --> 30:22.830
an evacuation
of nonessentials.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.340
We should still be
on the lookout for stragglers.

30:24.540 --> 30:25.840
Yeah, Street's right. One
of my kids is in the hospital,

30:26.040 --> 30:28.070
last thing I'm doing
is leaving them behind.

30:28.270 --> 30:29.640
Heads on a swivel.
Don't forget--

30:29.840 --> 30:30.880
these guys are trained killers.
Let's fill the gaps.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.160
ALL:
Stay liquid!

30:35.330 --> 30:36.650
Hey, Mom.

30:36.850 --> 30:38.550
Why are the lights flashing?
Did you get my treat?

30:38.750 --> 30:41.650
Come on, baby. We're going
to play a little game.

30:41.850 --> 30:44.120
Hide-and-seek.
Why? What's happening?

30:44.320 --> 30:46.460
No questions right now.
We need to find

30:46.660 --> 30:48.810
a good hiding place.
Come on.

30:49.940 --> 30:52.630
MAN (over P.A.):
...the hospital is initiating

30:52.830 --> 30:54.230
emergency protocols.

30:54.430 --> 30:56.970
All visitors and
non-essential staff

30:57.170 --> 30:59.350
are instructed to exit
immediately.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.560
* *

31:09.000 --> 31:11.220
Bed's still warm.

31:11.420 --> 31:13.550
Find them.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.900
(siren whoop, tires screech)

31:20.710 --> 31:21.960
Mom,

31:22.160 --> 31:23.330
you're scaring me.

31:23.530 --> 31:25.330
No, sweetie.

31:25.530 --> 31:26.860
It'll be okay.

31:27.060 --> 31:28.930
Just want you
to stay here.

31:29.130 --> 31:30.730
Make yourself small...

31:30.930 --> 31:32.500
and stay here,

31:32.700 --> 31:34.190
no matter what.

31:35.090 --> 31:37.440
Wait. You're leaving? Mom!
Trust me.

31:37.640 --> 31:40.080
We've been through so much.

31:40.280 --> 31:41.780
And we'll get through this, too.

31:41.980 --> 31:43.750
Just be brave,
like always.

31:43.950 --> 31:45.530
Okay?

31:58.950 --> 32:00.180
Clear.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.220
CABRERA:
Clear.

32:10.690 --> 32:11.930
Clear.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.290
Suspect deep, going from

32:23.490 --> 32:25.570
room on the right
to the room on the left.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.960
(grunting)

32:32.160 --> 32:33.970
Hands behind your back!

32:34.170 --> 32:36.070
20-David.
One suspect in custody.

32:36.270 --> 32:38.270
Any eyes on Mariam or the kid?
Negative.

32:38.470 --> 32:39.670
Still looking.
(gunshot, woman screams)

32:39.870 --> 32:41.570
Shots fired.
Nurses' station.

32:41.770 --> 32:44.060
LAPD!

32:44.790 --> 32:46.540
(Mariam whimpers)

32:46.740 --> 32:48.080
Second suspect down.

32:48.280 --> 32:49.610
Are you hurt? We heard a shot.
No. My little girl, Gia.

32:49.810 --> 32:52.780
I've got to get to my daughter.
(Gia screams)

32:52.980 --> 32:54.920
Oh, my God!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.290
I need you to get back
and stay down.

32:56.490 --> 32:57.750
I know what everything
in your head wants

32:57.950 --> 32:59.060
to do right now,
but let us handle it.

32:59.260 --> 33:00.720
For Gia's sake.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.340
Cabrera?
(panting)

33:07.110 --> 33:09.550
DEACON:
LAPD! Let the girl go!

33:13.420 --> 33:15.610
Hondo, Arjet has the girl.

33:15.810 --> 33:16.990
They're in the elevator.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.210
CABRERA:
It's going up.

33:19.410 --> 33:21.450
26-David, taking
the stairs.

33:21.650 --> 33:22.610
We'll head 'em off.

33:22.810 --> 33:23.610
Cabrera, tell us where

33:23.810 --> 33:25.020
the elevator stops.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.970
They're headed to the roof.

33:30.340 --> 33:33.040
Street. 11 o'clock.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.350
Street, post up left.
I'm going right.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.500
Give it up, Arjet!

33:47.700 --> 33:50.170
The whole building's surrounded.
You're not gonna get away.

33:50.370 --> 33:52.730
What makes you think
I'm trying to get away?

33:53.330 --> 33:54.550
Tamia betrayed me.

33:54.750 --> 33:56.410
She helped those
soldiers kill my family.

33:56.610 --> 34:00.150
I'm not going anywhere until
I've done what I came to do.

34:00.350 --> 34:04.440
So bring Tamia here
or the child dies!

34:12.010 --> 34:13.530
You don't have to do this.
Let the girl go.

34:13.730 --> 34:15.070
She's got nothing to do with
what happened to your family.

34:15.270 --> 34:16.830
You're wrong.

34:17.030 --> 34:19.670
This sick little bug is no
doubt why Tamia betrayed us.

34:19.870 --> 34:21.170
She's a mother.

34:21.370 --> 34:23.070
She did what she had to do
to save her child.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.280
ARJET:
At the expense
of my family?

34:25.480 --> 34:27.410
She's as responsible
for their deaths

34:27.610 --> 34:29.550
as the devils who killed them.

34:29.750 --> 34:32.120
DEACON: We're in position
on a neighboring rooftop.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.140
Your 11 o'clock.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.920
Deac, she's too close
to the edge.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.820
You take the shot,
she could fall

34:39.020 --> 34:40.720
and take the kid with her.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.560
Well, then we need
to separate them somehow.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.760
ARJET: The only thing
that kept me alive

34:44.960 --> 34:48.000
as I bled on the floor
next to my sons was revenge.

34:48.200 --> 34:50.330
So save your talk
for someone else.

34:50.530 --> 34:53.790
I want Tamia!

34:54.520 --> 34:55.570
You see that?

34:55.770 --> 34:56.840
Her arm is shaking.

34:57.040 --> 34:57.840
She could barely hold
that gun up.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.540
The raid on her compound.

34:59.740 --> 35:01.080
She must be injured.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.760
Deacon, I need you ready
to take that shot.

35:03.430 --> 35:06.520
I'm fine with killing
this child if I have to.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.290
Seems fitting, actually.

35:08.490 --> 35:10.550
Bring Tamia here.

35:10.750 --> 35:12.860
Tamia's not coming.

35:13.060 --> 35:15.810
Back off, or I'll kill you...

35:16.540 --> 35:18.430
...then the bug.

35:18.630 --> 35:20.150
Not with your gun
shaking like that.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.440
Deacon, now.
(gunshot)

35:27.640 --> 35:28.540
(Arjet cries out)

35:28.740 --> 35:30.860
(Gia sobbing)

35:35.400 --> 35:38.180
STREET: Come here.
You're all right. You're okay.

35:38.380 --> 35:39.730
It's okay.

35:41.400 --> 35:46.170
20-David. Suspect down.
Child is safe.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.400
Aaron.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.200
Heard what
you guys did.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.600
Saving a mother
and her sick child.

36:00.800 --> 36:01.910
I just wanted to
congratulate you.

36:02.110 --> 36:03.870
Well, it wouldn't have
been possible

36:04.070 --> 36:05.740
without crucial intel
that we received from

36:05.940 --> 36:07.240
an anonymous email.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.150
Hmm.
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

36:10.350 --> 36:12.420
I'm afraid I cannot
confirm or deny.

36:12.620 --> 36:14.150
Mm.

36:14.350 --> 36:16.650
Well...

36:16.850 --> 36:18.190
I'm grateful
to whoever did.

36:18.390 --> 36:21.930
And for what it's worth,
I'm sorry for

36:22.130 --> 36:23.130
holding your feet to the fire

36:23.330 --> 36:25.500
when you were doing
all you could.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.060
I should have taken you
at your word.

36:27.260 --> 36:30.300
Well, didn't make it
real easy on you, either.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.870
It's not hard to see how you'd
think I was holding a grudge.

36:33.070 --> 36:34.870
I, uh, took my jabs.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.180
I guess it's just
always been easier

36:38.380 --> 36:41.040
to blame you for my
father's death than him.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.400
Yeah.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.620
What is this?

36:47.820 --> 36:50.970
It's, um, a little context.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.990
It's a transcript of
my father's IA tribunal.

36:55.190 --> 36:56.840
Mm-hmm.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.230
You spoke on his behalf.

37:00.430 --> 37:01.500
Yeah.

37:01.700 --> 37:04.170
It wasn't greed
that drove your dad to steal.

37:04.370 --> 37:06.690
He was in deep
with some bad people.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.210
He was trying
to save your house,

37:09.410 --> 37:11.310
and I didn't know that
when I turned him in.

37:11.510 --> 37:13.430
Wish I had.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.220
I didn't realize that.
Mm.

37:18.420 --> 37:21.800
My... mother never really
talked about it.

37:25.370 --> 37:28.160
Your father was
a good man, Aaron.

37:28.360 --> 37:31.950
He just made
a couple of bad decisions.

37:33.150 --> 37:35.730
But he'd be proud of
the man you are today.

37:35.930 --> 37:37.900
He always talked
about how smart you were,

37:38.100 --> 37:40.290
destined for great things.

37:42.090 --> 37:44.330
Looks like
your old man was right.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.830
Thanks.

37:52.700 --> 37:55.120
Uh, well, uh, I gotta go.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.820
Can't miss another
family dinner.
No.

37:57.020 --> 37:59.070
(both laugh)

38:01.880 --> 38:04.560
Hey, how about we get a cup
of coffee sometime soon? Huh?

38:04.760 --> 38:07.880
You know, when you're
not saving L.A.
(laughs)

38:08.750 --> 38:10.570
You know what?

38:10.770 --> 38:12.570
I think I'd like that.

38:12.770 --> 38:14.860
Yeah.

38:25.570 --> 38:28.300
I told you
I'd be out of here tonight.

38:29.270 --> 38:31.250
Assuming the damn doctor
comes to sign me out.

38:31.460 --> 38:32.820
He said he just
wanted to give you

38:33.020 --> 38:34.330
one more look
before we go.

38:34.530 --> 38:36.260
I'll go see if
I can find him.

38:36.460 --> 38:38.210
Okay.

38:41.180 --> 38:45.320
You know you're gonna have to
take it easy for a while, right?

38:46.220 --> 38:49.410
So Hondo's kid must be
coming pretty soon, yeah?

38:49.610 --> 38:50.770
Yep. (chuckles)

38:50.970 --> 38:52.440
He must be thrilled.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.840
(laughs)
Yeah.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.960
But a girl?

38:56.800 --> 38:58.420
Oh, thank God
for you boys.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.370
I don't know what
I'd have done with a daughter.

39:04.140 --> 39:05.360
Dad, there's something
I have to tell you,

39:05.560 --> 39:08.890
but I don't want it
to change things between us.

39:09.090 --> 39:10.930
Of course not.

39:11.130 --> 39:14.210
Nothing you say could
change us. Trust that.

39:16.050 --> 39:18.970
A patrol cop reached out to me
a couple months ago.

39:19.170 --> 39:21.040
Right?
She's, like, really great.

39:21.240 --> 39:23.610
She loves the beat,
loves to surf.

39:23.810 --> 39:26.280
I think you'd really like her.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.450
Her?
Yeah.

39:28.650 --> 39:30.980
You finally settling down, Dom?
Oh, God, no, no.

39:31.180 --> 39:33.130
It's not like that.

39:34.870 --> 39:38.050
Her name is Eva Durant.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.190
Her mom was a detective.

39:40.390 --> 39:44.550
You worked with her
in Hollenbeck some time ago.

39:47.980 --> 39:50.150
Sofia.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.390
I remember her.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.810
You're saying
she had a daughter?

39:59.010 --> 40:01.900
About 40 years ago.

40:05.130 --> 40:07.500
Do you want to hear the rest?

40:12.110 --> 40:14.830
Yeah. Yeah.

40:15.030 --> 40:17.340
I think I do.

40:22.580 --> 40:24.600
Hondo?

40:24.800 --> 40:27.200
In here, Pop.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.510
All right, what's so important
that you had me

40:29.710 --> 40:30.840
rush over here?

40:31.040 --> 40:33.240
What'd you give away now?
What's all this?

40:33.440 --> 40:34.880
Look, I tried everything
I could to find

40:35.080 --> 40:37.850
my old King Castle,
but just like you, no luck.

40:38.050 --> 40:39.150
That thing's long gone.

40:39.350 --> 40:41.180
So, what?
This your way of apologizing?

40:41.380 --> 40:42.550
You think it's gonna be
that easy, son?

40:42.750 --> 40:45.490
No, hell no. There ain't
nothing easy about you.

40:45.690 --> 40:47.060
Look, I'm sorry
for taking something

40:47.260 --> 40:48.590
with so many memories
for granted.

40:48.790 --> 40:50.340
That wasn't my intention.

40:52.110 --> 40:53.800
I know, son.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.470
(sighs)

40:55.670 --> 40:58.320
Maybe I put too much weight
on that thing.

40:59.150 --> 41:00.400
I just wanted to be able
to pass something on

41:00.600 --> 41:01.740
to my granddaughter.

41:01.940 --> 41:03.940
Bring something from the
past into the future.

41:04.140 --> 41:06.340
Well, she's lucky
she's got you here.

41:06.540 --> 41:08.510
Look, no dollhouse
is gonna compare to

41:08.710 --> 41:10.950
the love and wisdom that
you're gonna give my baby girl.

41:11.150 --> 41:12.520
Trust me.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.640
I know from experience.

41:16.300 --> 41:19.210
You know what?
I'm glad you feel that way.

41:19.770 --> 41:24.130
'Cause building these things,
that's hard work.

41:24.330 --> 41:26.130
I think I'm gonna
sit this one out.

41:26.330 --> 41:28.530
I'll hop on the next one.
No, come on now.

41:28.730 --> 41:31.200
I was thinking
we could build it together.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.600
You gonna leave me
hanging with all this?
No.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.340
I plan on watching you
and make sure

41:35.540 --> 41:37.410
you don't mess this thing up
for my grandbaby.

41:37.610 --> 41:39.510
Oh, you're gonna
do me like that?

41:39.710 --> 41:41.610
Just like that.

41:41.810 --> 41:44.780
(both laughing)
