WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.303
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.206
The First.
That's what it wants.

00:05.238 --> 00:09.643
To erase all the Slayers
in training and their Watchers,
along with their methods.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.080
WILLOW:
 Buffy, he's been feeding.

00:12.112 --> 00:15.548
He really didn't know
what he'd done.
Wasn't in his control.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.185
It's a trigger.
It's a brainwashing term.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.987
It's how the military
makes sleeper agents.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.756
-Amy.
-Can I come in?

00:22.789 --> 00:26.227
If you really are my friend,
you'd better stay away from me.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.230
-Agent Finn, my implant?
-The implant works.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.399
Hostile 17 can't harm
 any living creature

00:31.431 --> 00:33.701
in any way without
 intense neurological pain.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.103
(shouting)

00:36.404 --> 00:38.572
You think you could
just do that to me?

00:38.606 --> 00:39.606
(gunfire)

00:41.642 --> 00:42.810
Tara?

00:44.478 --> 00:48.216
Somebody! Help!
(yells)

00:48.249 --> 00:50.350
You wanna do
the sleeping
arrangements?

00:50.384 --> 00:53.554
Okay. You, uh,
better not hog the covers.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.395
Are you sure
you'll all be all right?

01:01.429 --> 01:03.863
You'll only be gone
for two days.

01:03.896 --> 01:06.466
-I think we've managed
a bit longer than that.
-Right.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.036
(sighs)
Oh.

01:09.069 --> 01:13.373
Dawn, Vi's left her notebook
on the mantelpiece. Would you
mind running it out to the car?

01:13.406 --> 01:15.608
-Sure.
-(sighs)

01:15.643 --> 01:18.545
While you're at it, smack her on
the head with it and remind her
not to leave it lying around.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.048
On it.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.284
I'm just a little bit
twitchy about leaving
you alone again here

01:24.317 --> 01:28.489
while-- while things are...
in such a state of flux.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.890
I know. But you should go.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.894
This trip is important
for the girls to understand
the source of their power

01:33.926 --> 01:35.662
and to know how
to use it right.

01:35.695 --> 01:38.498
I don't think they appreciate
the gravity of what
we're undertaking.

01:38.531 --> 01:41.468
It's frightening
and it's difficult.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.671
And then apparently
someone told them that
the vision quest consists of

01:44.704 --> 01:47.608
me driving them
into the desert,
doing the hokey pokey

01:47.640 --> 01:50.343
until a spooky
Rasta-mama Slayer

01:50.378 --> 01:53.281
arrives and speaks
to them in riddles.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.918
-That's not exactly
how I put it. I--
-(footsteps)

01:57.950 --> 02:02.022
-BUFFY: Hey! How's Kennedy?
-Still "fluey." Bummed about
missing the field trip.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.924
She says she wants you to
meditate extra hard for her

02:04.957 --> 02:07.528
and bring her back
some s'mores.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.097
Ah, yes, s'mores.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.599
-I'm going to end up singing
campfire songs, aren't I?
-Oh, yeah.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.269
-(door opens)
-Giles, you might wanna
get out there.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.969
Oh, God. What?

02:17.003 --> 02:18.938
Molly and Rona are fighting
over who gets to drive
the first leg.

02:18.972 --> 02:23.009
Bet you wish you'd renewed
that California State
driver's license now, huh?

02:23.043 --> 02:27.014
-Rona won. You should probably
let Molly out of the trunk.
-(honking)

02:27.046 --> 02:30.950
-I never actually realized just
how compact Molly really is.
-(groans)

02:30.984 --> 02:34.587
-Just please be safe
while I'm away.
-You too.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.899
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:47.268 --> 02:50.871
Giles is off on the retreat.

02:50.903 --> 02:53.906
-Give us all a chance
for a breather, eh?
-From Giles?

02:53.941 --> 02:58.378
From the constant pitter-patter
of clomping teenage
girlie feet.

02:58.412 --> 03:03.050
-I have no idea
what you're talking about.
-Come off it.

03:03.082 --> 03:07.587
No, I enjoy
my responsibility as mentor,
role model, life guide.

03:07.621 --> 03:11.925
Oh, my God. I cannot believe
I have my bathroom all to myself
for two whole days.

03:11.959 --> 03:15.728
It's like a bloody
war zone up there,
and not in the good way.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.064
Have you seen the kitchen
since they've been here?

03:18.098 --> 03:21.200
I'm just tryin' to stay
out of their way.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.670
I noticed.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.872
Hmm. This is better.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.709
Believe me, it's safer.

03:28.741 --> 03:33.212
Okay. But you've been fine
in close contact
with the girls.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.549
Yeah. With you
by my side, yeah.

03:35.582 --> 03:38.718
But, uh, you wouldn't let me
hurt one of 'em.

03:38.752 --> 03:42.723
And that's the way it's gonna be
until we're sure the First
is done making me its bitch.

03:44.457 --> 03:47.895
Either we're together,
or I'm on the leash.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.963
We just need to make sure
the trigger's deactivated then.

03:50.997 --> 03:55.502
-We've got a couple of days,
lack of pitter-patter and all.
-Buffy?

03:58.138 --> 04:00.473
What?

04:00.508 --> 04:02.776
-Ow.
-Ow?

04:02.810 --> 04:05.145
Ow, ow.
(gasps)

04:05.177 --> 04:07.213
(groans)

04:07.247 --> 04:10.984
What's wrong?
Spike, what is going on?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.387
(panting)
The chip.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.689
Oh, God.
Why would--

04:18.158 --> 04:19.526
(screams)

04:21.093 --> 04:24.632
(groaning, screaming)

04:27.435 --> 04:28.536
(theme music playing)

05:21.355 --> 05:23.824
(teakettle whistling)

05:27.495 --> 05:30.531
WILLOW:
Hey. How is he?

05:30.564 --> 05:35.536
Oh, in the "goes" part
of "comes and goes."

05:35.569 --> 05:38.906
Well, there seems to be
a definite lack of screaming.
That has to be good.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.307
You'd think.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.843
-That for the other patient?
-Yeah.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.745
Thought I'd bring her
some tea. Help her feel better.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.882
Mm-hmm.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.353
-It's just tea.
-(chuckles)

05:56.023 --> 05:57.891
Wil?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.694
How much do you know
about the chip?

06:01.728 --> 06:04.163
Spike's chip?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.600
Well, I remember trying
to dig up stuff back then,

06:06.634 --> 06:08.701
but, you know, turns out

06:08.735 --> 06:11.404
when a secret government
agency studies vampires

06:11.439 --> 06:14.675
and puts chips in their brains
that keep them
from hurting people,

06:14.708 --> 06:17.076
they don't really
build websites.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.879
-Why?
-Even with the chip,

06:19.980 --> 06:22.449
Spike was able to hurt
all those people
when he was brainwashed.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.351
Yeah, but he was under
the control of the First.

06:25.384 --> 06:28.021
Maybe something's wrong
with it.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.923
That chip is misfiring
all on its own then.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.093
Well, this'll be fun.

06:33.125 --> 06:36.096
Remember when things
used to be nice and boring?

06:37.297 --> 06:39.165
No.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.170
Have fun delivering the tea.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.941
Okay, not when you make it sound
all dirty like that.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.745
It's just tea.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.947
(knocking)

06:54.981 --> 06:58.485
Hey. I figure the best thing
for a cold is a nice
hot cup of--

07:00.286 --> 07:02.254
Boots?

07:02.355 --> 07:04.757
-Hey.
-For someone who's sick,

07:04.791 --> 07:08.295
you look surprisingly robust
and... casual dressy.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.932
Well, the lighting
in here is good.
Maybe it's just the--

07:11.964 --> 07:14.434
You were never sick.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.004
No, I was never sick.

07:17.036 --> 07:19.238
Oh, you are so busted.

07:19.271 --> 07:21.608
-Xander's gonna have to
drive you to the desert--
-Willow!

07:21.641 --> 07:24.845
Chill. There's a reason
I didn't go.

07:24.877 --> 07:28.115
I have a thing--
a separate thing.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.182
-What?
-Something's coming down.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.855
I have my own mission,
and I need your help.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.959
* So I can be

07:38.992 --> 07:42.129
* Happy again

07:44.865 --> 07:46.834
This is a mission?

07:46.867 --> 07:49.702
Oh. Yeah.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.838
And the little
paper umbrellas
are a signal for what?

07:53.540 --> 07:56.610
-We're not on a mission,
are we?
-Hey, trust me.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.211
I told you.
I have a thing.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.382
Come on! Come on!
Just hang out with me a little.

08:03.415 --> 08:05.653
(music continues)

08:06.920 --> 08:08.988
You're sexy when you pout.

08:10.322 --> 08:12.225
Why do you do that?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.228
To get you to stay.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.336
All right, I'll stay
for one drink.
Then I'm going home.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.572
Okay, one drink.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.475
I can work with that.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.711
Let's start with
the easy stuff.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.547
How long have you known?

08:33.581 --> 08:37.683
-That you were gay.
-Wait. That's easy?

08:37.717 --> 08:41.989
And what, you just assume
that I'm-- I'm gay?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.323
I mean, presume much?

08:44.356 --> 08:48.394
Okay, sorry.
How long have you enjoyed
having sex with women?

08:48.427 --> 08:51.264
Hey!

08:51.298 --> 08:55.235
And what, you think you have
some sort of special
"lesbidar" or something?

08:55.268 --> 08:58.437
Okay, you know there's
a better word for that, right?

09:01.774 --> 09:04.476
You really haven't been getting
out there much, have you?

09:06.879 --> 09:09.282
Well, I just--

09:09.316 --> 09:13.721
Can you always tell just--
just by looking at someone?

09:13.754 --> 09:16.123
No. No, of course not.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.591
That wouldn't be any fun.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.761
The fun part is the process
of getting to know a girl.

09:21.794 --> 09:25.131
It's like-- It's like
flirting in code.

09:25.164 --> 09:28.067
It's using
body language and...

09:28.100 --> 09:30.604
laughing at
the right jokes and...

09:32.673 --> 09:35.207
and looking into her eyes...

09:35.241 --> 09:38.745
and knowing she's still
whispering to you,

09:38.778 --> 09:42.581
even when she's not
saying a word.

09:42.615 --> 09:46.286
And that sense that
if you can just touch her...

09:46.318 --> 09:49.588
just once,

09:49.623 --> 09:54.126
everything will be okay
for both of you.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.129
That's how you can tell.

09:57.163 --> 10:00.100
Or if she's really hot,
you just get her drunk,
see if she comes on to you.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.640
Three years ago.
That's when I knew.

10:09.176 --> 10:14.380
And it wasn't women.
It was woman. Just one.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.784
Lucky woman.

10:21.053 --> 10:24.191
Popped another blood vessel,
I think.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.630
There's gotta be a reason
why the chip is going
all wonky.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.834
Maybe it's related
to the trigger.

10:33.866 --> 10:38.138
Or maybe it has something
to do with the new soul.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.039
Or maybe I wasn't meant
to last this long.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.813
One more thing you and I
have in common, eh, pet?

10:51.183 --> 10:55.388
-Well, we'll fix it.
We'll hit serious research mode.
-Good.

10:55.422 --> 10:58.926
Try behavior modification
software throughout the ages.

11:00.659 --> 11:03.230
Okay. You're right.

11:03.263 --> 11:07.399
Not a book thing.
It's a phone thing.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.136
Who you gonna call?

11:10.169 --> 11:14.573
-God, that phrase is never
gonna be usable again, is it?
-Doubt it.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.979
-Do your parents know?
-Yeah.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.248
My mom was--
was all proud,

11:21.280 --> 11:24.083
like I was making
some political statement.

11:24.116 --> 11:29.489
And then the statement mojo
wore off, and I was just gay.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.390
She hardly
ever even met Tara.

11:32.926 --> 11:36.730
-Classic.
-I didn't mind.

11:36.764 --> 11:40.600
-Tara and I are
kind of private.
-I'm sorry.

11:42.034 --> 11:46.306
-It must have been--
-Were, I mean, private.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.712
Yes, Agent Finn. Riley.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.716
Tell him we're having
a problem with Spike's chip.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.618
No, his chip.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.422
-Spike.
-Listen, pet--

12:02.455 --> 12:06.793
Well, no, no, Finn is
his last name. Yeah.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.696
Well, did he use to work there
and maybe he got transferred?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.730
-(gasps)
-Oh.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.466
Is this actually
a flower shop,

12:14.500 --> 12:17.403
or is this one of those things
where I'm supposed
to play along...

12:17.437 --> 12:19.907
to show that I know
it's really secret ops?

12:19.940 --> 12:24.211
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.
Um, okay.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.312
-Right.
-(sighs)

12:26.346 --> 12:30.951
Well, if some guy named Finn
shows up to buy flowers--

12:30.984 --> 12:32.820
Yeah. Thanks.

12:34.586 --> 12:37.389
(sighs)
Wrong number, or a giant
government conspiracy.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.459
One of the--

12:39.491 --> 12:43.663
-Spike?
-(sniffles)

12:43.696 --> 12:46.499
This one seemed easier
than the others.

12:46.533 --> 12:50.470
See? Probably just
gonna fade--

12:50.503 --> 12:53.572
(screaming)

12:53.605 --> 12:56.009
It was Gone with the Wind.

12:56.043 --> 12:59.947
I saw that and I knew
I wanted to sweep Scarlett
off her feet.

12:59.980 --> 13:04.417
-You were five.
-Well, I'm not saying the
sweeping would have been easy.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.220
(music continues)

13:08.554 --> 13:11.791
-What?
-I just--

13:11.825 --> 13:14.293
I still don't get it.

13:15.863 --> 13:19.365
Why you like me.
I mean, you don't
even know me.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.269
Have you seen you?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.871
And we like the same things--

13:24.904 --> 13:27.106
Italian, skate punk,

13:27.139 --> 13:29.708
Robert Parker mysteries,
fighting evil.

13:29.741 --> 13:34.346
I don't like any of that stuff,
except the fighting evil part.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.216
But even then I'd prefer
a nice foot massage.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.719
Okay. I dig the way

13:39.751 --> 13:42.389
you always turn off
the Moulin Rou DVD
at chapter 32...

13:42.422 --> 13:44.724
so it has a happy ending.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.229
I like the way you speak.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.697
It's interesting.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.566
And your freckles.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.735
Lickable.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.740
I'm not so into
the magic stuff.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.344
Seems like fairy-tale crap
to me, but it matters to you.

14:04.376 --> 14:06.578
You care about it.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.916
So, it's cool.

14:12.851 --> 14:16.023
Well, this is my stop.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.192
So--

14:21.094 --> 14:22.895
Glad we talked.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.933
Yes. Kind of cleared
the air, huh?

14:26.966 --> 14:31.138
Yeah, totally.
Air cleared. Check.

14:32.705 --> 14:38.610
-You know, in the spirit
of air clearing...
-Yeah?

14:38.644 --> 14:41.581
I feel like I need
to be honest about something.

14:41.614 --> 14:45.751
-Is something wrong?
-No. No.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.720
It's just...

14:49.456 --> 14:54.226
I think you should know.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.083
WARREN:
Well, that was nice.

15:27.159 --> 15:29.261
Are you okay?

15:29.296 --> 15:33.765
I'm not used to literally
knocking girls off their feet
with just the power of my lips.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.304
Okay, are you gonna
pick that up, or--

15:38.337 --> 15:40.940
I don't-- What are you?

15:40.974 --> 15:44.010
Is this a freckle thing,
'cause--

15:46.678 --> 15:49.515
Oh, God. Oh, God.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.952
What is that?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.356
It's the man that I killed.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.826
Okay. Hold up a sec!

15:59.859 --> 16:02.595
-(all gasp)
-Guys?

16:02.629 --> 16:05.365
-Get Buffy!
Tell her the First is back!
-No, I'm not the First.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.667
We're not interested
in any of your evil lies.
We've heard 'em all.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.038
-No, guys, it's me.
-WARREN: I'm me.
I'm Willow. Guys, come on.

16:11.071 --> 16:14.006
-Ask Kennedy. She was there.
-KENNEDY: I don't know.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.309
I'm not sure.
We were up in Willow's room
and we were--

16:17.344 --> 16:18.211
No.

16:20.547 --> 16:24.850
-No. You're back.
-No, I'm not. It's not--
I'm not it. Listen to me!

16:24.884 --> 16:29.456
No more listening.
I know who you are now.
I know what you made me do.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.325
Your promises of happy fields
and dancing schnauzers...

16:32.359 --> 16:35.394
-and being demigods
won't work on me anymore.
-ANYA: Buffy?

16:35.427 --> 16:37.730
-And the Bringers
are probably coming too.
-No, I'm not the First.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.866
You made me do things.
Things I can never
take back ever.

16:40.899 --> 16:43.735
-I'm not the First!
-What the hell is going
on in here?

16:44.937 --> 16:46.706
-Ow!
-Buffy?

16:46.739 --> 16:48.408
-Wait.
-ANYA: But if he's the First--

16:48.441 --> 16:50.576
-I'm not the First.
-You're not the First.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.811
I know!

16:51.844 --> 16:53.011
Oh, my God.

16:53.046 --> 16:56.482
-You're back.
-Hey! Bad touching.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.385
-(groaning)
-Everyone, please stop.
It's me.

16:59.418 --> 17:02.121
-It's Willow.
-I'm Willow.

17:04.257 --> 17:08.728
-Are you sure?
-There are other stories
from kindergarten--

17:08.760 --> 17:13.031
non-yellow crayon stories
in which you don't come out
in such a good light.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.934
An incident involving
Aquaman underoos, for example.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.704
-You want me to start talkin'?
-Hey, Willow.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.441
-What happened?
-I don't know.

17:21.473 --> 17:24.711
Uh, we were there,
and-- and then
I looked like him.

17:24.742 --> 17:27.413
Oh. Like a glamour.

17:27.445 --> 17:30.282
Maybe. But I probably
brought it on myself.

17:30.317 --> 17:34.019
-What makes you think that?
-Well, it wouldn't be
the first time.

17:34.052 --> 17:37.624
And I have a history
with my witchy subconscious
making things go "kerfloopy."

17:37.656 --> 17:41.228
Remember the wacky
"I can't see you,
you can't see me" spell?

17:41.260 --> 17:44.029
-Guys!
-It's so real.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.066
-Yeah. All too aware.
-BUFFY: Okay, say you're right

17:47.099 --> 17:50.603
and you did do this to yourself.
Why would your subconscious
turn you into Warren?

17:50.636 --> 17:54.173
Obviously, because
I feel bad about killing him.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.310
Look, we'll-- we'll deal.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.980
-We'll get help.
-No, I can handle this.

18:01.012 --> 18:05.551
-On your own? Why?
-I did it. I'll fix it.

18:05.585 --> 18:09.422
-And I don't want you
to see me this way anyway.
-It's a little late for that.

18:09.455 --> 18:12.057
-Seriously, I'm not posing
any big threat to the world.
-(moaning)

18:12.090 --> 18:15.060
And it looks like you've got
your hands full already.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.297
I'll go. I'll handle it.
I'll fix it.

18:17.329 --> 18:19.632
And I'll be back before
you even know I'm gone.

18:19.665 --> 18:21.468
Promise.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.571
Spike?

18:25.605 --> 18:28.641
-Buffy.
-I'm right here.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.644
-SPIKE: The chip fired again.
-BUFFY: I kind of figured.

18:31.678 --> 18:35.815
Maybe they'll call back.
Maybe they'll send help.

18:35.847 --> 18:37.650
Maybe we can't wait.

18:47.693 --> 18:50.197
-(gasps)
-Okay.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.266
Safe to say no one will ever
accuse you of being too butch.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.934
-Kennedy, go home.
-Come on.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.105
I mean,
you turned into a guy.

18:59.137 --> 19:02.474
I mean, if you take a step back,
seriously, there's a certain
element of humor here, right?

19:04.544 --> 19:07.180
Well, a really,
really big step.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.348
I killed him.
It's hard to see the chuckles.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.990
-So, you got a plan?
-Yep. I'm gonna get
some help reversing it.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.826
-I thought you were gonna
try it yourself.
-I did try.

19:20.859 --> 19:23.695
It didn't work.
Something's blocking me.

19:23.730 --> 19:28.134
Well, all the more reason for
me to go with you. Plus, I was
there with you when it happened.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.135
Let me come to try
to help too.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.572
I really think I'm fine
with the handling.

19:32.672 --> 19:36.442
-By yourself? Why?
-I'm the one that killed him.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.881
I-- It's hard to understand.

19:41.913 --> 19:46.184
Given. How about I just
tag along anyway?
Keep you company.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.387
I'm taking that as a "Yes."

19:48.421 --> 19:49.655
Fine. Come.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.458
Try not to get in the way.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.761
You know where
you're going?

19:55.795 --> 19:58.197
To see some old friends
of mine.

19:58.230 --> 20:00.467
It's been a while,
but maybe they can help.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.739
Are you sure you still
wanna go back
in this place with me?

20:06.772 --> 20:08.941
Eh, nothing good
on TV tonight.

20:15.914 --> 20:19.251
-Here we are.
-Yep, here we are.

20:22.721 --> 20:26.025
-Do you think
this stuff's still good?
-I don't know.

20:26.057 --> 20:28.227
It worked pretty good
when the Initiative
held me captive here.

20:30.730 --> 20:34.232
Every time I'd get
a little... rambunctious,

20:34.267 --> 20:38.371
the chip would kick in
and I'd feel like my head
was gonna explode.

20:38.404 --> 20:42.008
They'd dope me up
and everything would be all
daffodils and teddy bears.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.979
For a couple of hours anyway.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.582
Maybe we should search
for files and stuff.

20:49.615 --> 20:53.286
Find out everything we can
about the chip-- shelf life.

20:53.319 --> 20:56.423
I'll take whatever
I can get.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.856
-Ready?
-Yeah.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.846
-(phone ringing)
-I'll get it.

21:19.878 --> 21:22.949
I'm supposed to get a call when
the new League of Extraordinary
 Gentlemen comes in.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.684
-I gave them this number.
-Can you see if you can get two?

21:25.718 --> 21:28.488
Summers' residence.
This is Andrew speaking.
How can I help you?

21:31.391 --> 21:33.291
Loser.

21:33.326 --> 21:37.229
Hey, do we know some
British guy named Robson?

21:41.032 --> 21:43.169
He was attacked,

21:43.201 --> 21:46.038
this Robson guy in England.

21:48.039 --> 21:50.643
And Giles was there
helpin' him.

21:50.676 --> 21:53.846
And there was a Bringer.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.282
-Xander--
-Robson blacked out, but
the last thing he remembers

21:57.316 --> 22:02.689
is Giles's head about
to get real familiar with
the Bringer's very sharp ax.

22:02.721 --> 22:05.657
-Oh, my God.
-Giles never mentioned
any of this.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.627
Robson said by the time
he came to,

22:08.661 --> 22:10.630
there was no Giles.

22:10.663 --> 22:15.535
So, what are we saying?

22:15.567 --> 22:19.005
Maybe Giles just didn't
wanna talk about it.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.374
Or maybe he didn't make it.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.142
Look, I'm not saying
it's a happy scenario,

22:23.174 --> 22:26.144
but we're dealing
with a Big Bad that can be
any dead person it wants.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.048
Because if you wanna infiltrate
the inner circle of the Slayer--

22:29.080 --> 22:32.884
You become the one person
she trusts more than
anybody else.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.987
But there's no way
that we can know.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.655
Actually, that's not true.

22:36.689 --> 22:40.426
The First can't take
corporeal form,
so it can't touch anything.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.863
Well, it's not like Giles
hasn't touched anything, right?

22:48.734 --> 22:50.737
Has anyone seen

22:50.769 --> 22:53.740
Giles touch anything
since he got back?

22:55.807 --> 22:57.644
Hold anything?

23:00.078 --> 23:02.013
Has anybody hugged him?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.915
Think very hard.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.692
-Wait a minute. Where are you--
-Desert. We're gonna find Giles.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.528
Oh, good. Let me just get
some tapes for the car.
I've been working on this mix--

23:15.561 --> 23:17.930
-XANDER: You're not coming.
-What? Why?

23:17.963 --> 23:20.732
'Cause I used to be evil?

23:20.767 --> 23:24.135
No. Actually,
because you're annoying,
but that's a good reason too.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.205
Wait. Don't-- Don't leave me
here all alone.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.041
-I keep getting attacked
in this house.
-Actually, Xander--

23:30.076 --> 23:33.579
What if this is all part of
the plan-- drive you guys away
so it can have its way with me?

23:33.613 --> 23:37.817
-Ever think of that?
-I'll risk it.

23:37.849 --> 23:41.953
Okay. Well, if you
leave me here alone,
I'll do something evil,

23:41.988 --> 23:44.289
like burning something,

23:44.323 --> 23:47.960
or gluing things together.

23:47.993 --> 23:51.096
For crying out loud, Harris.
Let's just take him.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.633
-At least we can keep
an eye on him.
-(sighs)

23:58.871 --> 24:02.642
-Xander?
-I know. They're out there
all alone, all of 'em.

24:18.691 --> 24:22.294
Instill us, O Great One,

24:22.327 --> 24:25.632
with peace, with strength,

24:25.664 --> 24:27.799
with compassion,

24:27.834 --> 24:30.269
with hope.

24:30.301 --> 24:32.203
The path we seek is yours.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.642
Keep us on that path.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.046
Oh, hey.
Wow. This is new.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.450
-Um, hi. We're--
-WARREN: Oh, hey.

24:44.482 --> 24:46.885
I'm sorry. Willow.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.820
We actually met
when I was a freshman,

24:48.855 --> 24:50.890
and also not a boy.

24:53.224 --> 24:57.496
-This is Kennedy.
-Hey.

24:57.529 --> 24:59.766
-You're Willow?
-Yeah.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.903
Wow. Look at you guys.

25:04.936 --> 25:09.474
Campus Wiccans.
I guess you got past
the whole bake-sale phase.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.044
No. We still do that too,
second Tuesday of every month.

25:12.077 --> 25:17.516
I'm sorry. I'm kind of
having a hard time with
the whole guy event thing.

25:17.549 --> 25:20.419
AMY:
Um, it's actually her.

25:20.451 --> 25:22.121
I can tell.

25:24.123 --> 25:28.259
-I know her.
-Okay. Whoa.

25:28.294 --> 25:32.263
Um, okay.
Here's the thing. Hi.

25:32.298 --> 25:36.268
Here's the thing.
I'll just get this
out of the way.

25:36.301 --> 25:40.606
I'm sort of screwed up.
But I mean, you already knew
that because you lived it.

25:40.640 --> 25:44.210
-Gotcha.
-But she's doing
so much better now. Amy.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.478
It's okay, Vaughne.
I wanna do this.

25:48.213 --> 25:52.218
It took me a long time
to really see myself.

25:52.250 --> 25:56.722
But I did.
'Cause that's the crazy thing
about hitting rock bottom--

25:56.756 --> 25:59.525
you get to relive
all the crappy things
that you did.

25:59.557 --> 26:02.862
And I wanted to come
find you and tell you...

26:02.894 --> 26:05.765
that I was here working
on things with these guys.

26:05.798 --> 26:10.603
And that they're good.
And that I was sorry.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.141
But you're here,

26:15.173 --> 26:17.209
looking like--

26:17.242 --> 26:19.478
Wow. How did this happen?

26:19.510 --> 26:23.715
That's what we're here to
find out. I mean, if we're done
with all the group hugging.

26:23.750 --> 26:28.420
I got hit with this,
like, glamour thing, and
I can't seem to shake it myself.

26:28.453 --> 26:31.691
I was hoping that someone here
might be able to help.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.762
Yeah. See, the thing is
we're more about
healing spirits

26:36.796 --> 26:38.664
and nurturing
our life force here.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.199
Oh.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.435
But we'll try.

26:44.470 --> 26:49.107
-AMY: Her spirit's true--
-What if she can't
handle this?

26:49.141 --> 26:51.477
You have a better idea?

26:51.509 --> 26:54.913
Give back the form
the soul requires, see that
the balance is put right.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.449
-(whooshing)
-(screams)

26:57.482 --> 27:01.420
-It didn't work?
-No, it didn't, you dumb bitch!

27:01.452 --> 27:03.622
Willow!

27:03.655 --> 27:06.792
-You slapped me.
-No, I-I-I didn't.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.227
It wasn't me.

27:09.828 --> 27:11.698
It was Warren.

27:24.076 --> 27:27.212
Willow? Willow?

27:27.246 --> 27:28.815
Okay, you're upset.

27:28.847 --> 27:33.152
Upset? Upset?
Are you just tuning in?
Did you not see that?

27:33.184 --> 27:35.153
I'm turning into him.

27:35.186 --> 27:38.390
It's not a trick.
It's not a glamour.
I'm becoming him--

27:38.423 --> 27:41.227
a murderous, misogynist man!

27:41.259 --> 27:44.496
Do you understand what he did--
what I could do?

27:44.529 --> 27:46.798
I killed him for a reason.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.201
Getting angry isn't helping.
We can still try it.

27:49.234 --> 27:51.569
You understand nothing
about magic.

27:51.603 --> 27:54.506
And in case
you haven't noticed,
our little date, it's over.

27:54.539 --> 27:56.208
Willow.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.945
Willow, wait!

28:08.253 --> 28:10.056
BUFFY:
Careful.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.493
Oh, God.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.363
They just left 'em.

28:20.231 --> 28:22.902
SPIKE:
They just sealed
the place off.

28:22.934 --> 28:25.636
Left everything as it was.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.713
BUFFY:
I'm thinkin' brief stay.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.950
Yeah. You're not wrong.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.526
I think I can get us
to the med lab.

28:47.558 --> 28:49.828
Find the drug.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.422
(metal creaking)

29:21.759 --> 29:23.863
Okay, I'll go. 'R'.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.936
Ghost is hard to play
by yourself.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.338
-How long since they left?
-XANDER: A few hours.

29:34.941 --> 29:38.176
If it is the First--
and I'm not saying it is--

29:38.210 --> 29:40.246
what are we
expecting to find?

29:40.278 --> 29:43.816
He didn't bring them
out there to meditate.

29:43.849 --> 29:47.353
Kinda makes you grateful
you weren't a Potential
after all,

29:47.385 --> 29:50.088
doesn't it-- safer?

29:50.122 --> 29:53.925
-Well, not so fast
with the "phew."
-He might know we're coming.

29:53.960 --> 29:57.429
Which means we're already
too late. And we're heading
out to the middle of nowhere.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.330
With no Slayer,
no powerful witch.

29:59.365 --> 30:02.534
Just a teenager,
a powerless former demon,
and two big geeks.

30:07.205 --> 30:09.240
Okay, license plate
game maybe?

30:33.265 --> 30:36.535
Look at me.
Crying like a little girl.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.750
(metal creaking)

30:52.784 --> 30:55.453
-Do you hear that?
-Yep.

31:00.058 --> 31:02.260
Think something survived?

31:04.296 --> 31:05.897
Sounds like.

31:07.266 --> 31:10.169
-Do you see where?
-No.

31:10.201 --> 31:13.538
But it sounded like it
was coming from over there.

31:13.571 --> 31:15.641
Whatever it is, it's not--

31:32.490 --> 31:34.893
-(roaring)
-(grunts)

31:34.926 --> 31:36.929
SPIKE:
Buffy!

31:36.962 --> 31:40.266
(footsteps approaching)

31:40.298 --> 31:43.102
-Where'd they go?
 -They took off.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.771
That was a little too creepy,
even for us.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.445
You're really worried
about her.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.720
Look, she's gonna
be fine, really.

32:01.752 --> 32:05.124
She's good at this.
She's strong.

32:05.156 --> 32:08.094
And she's dealt with
a lot worse,

32:08.126 --> 32:13.164
long before she went and found
herself a big, old potential
Slayer bodyguard, okay?

32:13.199 --> 32:15.166
Just have
a little faith in her.

32:15.201 --> 32:18.503
I never said
I was a potential Slayer.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.906
Oh. No, I think you did
when you first got here.
You told us--

32:21.940 --> 32:24.509
No, I didn't.

32:26.345 --> 32:29.615
How did you know...
who I was?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.351
Oops.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.294
Oh, no!

32:42.327 --> 32:45.364
No! God, no! Not now!

32:49.634 --> 32:51.869
Spike?
(grunts)

33:00.145 --> 33:03.548
So, same model as last time?

33:03.582 --> 33:05.384
How'd that work out for you?

33:09.721 --> 33:12.191
You'd be amazed.

33:24.935 --> 33:28.906
-(screams)
-Touch him! Touch him!

33:28.940 --> 33:31.242
-I feel him! I feel him!
-Me too.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.578
-Me too.
-Good. We all feel each other.

33:33.612 --> 33:37.249
Including some of us
who don't know each other well
enough to take such liberties.

33:37.282 --> 33:39.651
Thank you.

33:39.684 --> 33:44.155
I assume there is
a perfectly reasonable and not
at all insane explanation, yes?

33:44.190 --> 33:46.892
We thought you might be
non-corporeal evil.

33:46.924 --> 33:49.560
-We got a call. We couldn't
remember you touching anything.
-Had to make sure you were okay.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.230
-We were worried.
-Oh.

33:52.263 --> 33:55.733
Ah. Yes, well,
that's very sweet.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.769
Now wait a minute.
You thought--

33:58.804 --> 34:03.142
You think I'm evil if I bring
a group of girls on a camping
trip and don't touch them?

34:12.483 --> 34:15.186
Spike?

34:15.221 --> 34:17.623
(roaring)

34:17.655 --> 34:18.956
(grunts)

34:36.108 --> 34:37.909
(groaning)

34:45.016 --> 34:47.052
Hey.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.121
Are you still with us?

34:49.155 --> 34:51.456
Yeah.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.159
Well, that guy was--

34:55.760 --> 34:57.762
Just the beginning.

34:57.795 --> 34:59.764
-What's happening?
-MAN: Miss Summers.

34:59.797 --> 35:03.635
Agent Finn reported
that you tried to
contact him earlier today.

35:03.668 --> 35:06.538
I knew it!
Government conspiracy.

35:08.974 --> 35:12.443
He indicated you might
be needing our assistance.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.880
We're to provide you anything
you need to help "assface" here.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.885
Those were his
exact words, ma'am.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.869
Med team tells me
they took a look at the chip.

35:37.902 --> 35:41.507
You were right.
It's degraded.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.409
Leave it as it is much longer
and it'll be fatal to him.

35:46.512 --> 35:50.416
-Okay. So, how long till--
-Now, ma'am.

35:52.818 --> 35:56.954
Right. Of course. Um,
well, what do we do next?

35:56.987 --> 36:00.791
Agent Finn said
it was your call, ma'am.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.295
My-- What was my call?

36:03.329 --> 36:08.400
All decisions regarding
Hostile 17 are to be left
in your hands.

36:08.434 --> 36:12.137
His chip--
we can either repair it,

36:12.170 --> 36:14.105
or remove it.

36:21.380 --> 36:24.081
Tell me why
you did this to her.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.219
(grunts)

36:36.362 --> 36:39.864
-What did you do to her?
-What? To Willow?

36:39.898 --> 36:44.335
-Oh, just your standard
penance malediction is all.
-Okay.

36:44.369 --> 36:48.373
And that's magic
crazy talk for what?

36:48.407 --> 36:51.643
-I put a hex on her.
-Got that part.

36:52.878 --> 36:55.179
But why Warren?

36:55.213 --> 36:57.416
And why did it happen
after we kissed?

36:58.583 --> 37:00.418
(chuckles)

37:00.452 --> 37:02.288
That's rich.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.793
That must have been
some kiss.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.527
You must be good.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.762
Answer me.

37:11.797 --> 37:16.402
The hex I cast lets the victims'
subconscious pick the form
of their punishment.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.969
It's always better than anything
I can come up with.
Elegant, you know?

37:19.003 --> 37:22.072
Undo it. Let her out.

37:22.106 --> 37:25.543
Okay. Oh, wait.
I forgot. No.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.780
Why would you do this to her?
You really hate her that much?

37:30.148 --> 37:33.485
(sighs)
This is not about hate.

37:33.518 --> 37:36.253
It's about power.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.423
Willow always had
all the power.

37:38.456 --> 37:41.092
Long before she even
knew what to do with it.

37:41.126 --> 37:44.429
It just came
so easy for her.
The rest of us,

37:44.463 --> 37:47.965
we had to work twice as hard
to be half as good.

37:47.998 --> 37:51.469
But no one cares
about how hard you work.

37:51.503 --> 37:54.905
They just care about
cute, sweet Willow.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.108
They don't know
how weak she is.

37:57.141 --> 38:02.447
She gave in to evil
and stuff worse than
I can even imagine.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.483
She almost destroyed
the world.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.152
And yet everyone
keeps on loving her?

38:07.184 --> 38:11.590
So what's wrong
with having a little fun, huh?
Taking her down a peg or two?

38:11.623 --> 38:15.126
Fun? She's disappearing.

38:15.159 --> 38:19.697
Fading away in that creep,
and you think it's fun.

38:19.731 --> 38:23.201
It was just a game.
It's not my fault
that she's losing herself.

38:23.233 --> 38:25.471
I'm gonna stop you now,
you know.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.974
Hey, I'm not
the bad guy here.

38:30.007 --> 38:32.043
But I wonder where
he'd be right about now.
(snaps finger)

38:38.215 --> 38:40.518
Well, that was
a hell of a thing.

38:42.987 --> 38:46.791
Think you can
just do that to me-- that
I'd let you get away with it?

38:46.824 --> 38:48.860
Do? Get away with--

38:50.728 --> 38:54.032
Okay. Let's not get excited.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.534
It's too late for that.
This is what I am.

38:56.568 --> 39:00.871
I made it happen,
and I'll make it stop.

39:00.905 --> 39:04.909
Willow, what did you
make happen?

39:04.943 --> 39:07.077
You were there, bitch.
You saw it.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.581
I killed her.

39:09.614 --> 39:12.083
You mean "him."

39:12.117 --> 39:14.920
Her. Him.
You know what I mean.

39:14.952 --> 39:17.389
But you said "her."

39:17.422 --> 39:21.492
No. That was Warren.

39:21.527 --> 39:24.463
No. No, it wasn't.
You said I was there.

39:28.132 --> 39:31.168
-Who did you kill, Willow?
-It was your fault, slut!

39:31.202 --> 39:35.740
You tricked me.
Got me to forget.

39:38.208 --> 39:40.579
-Tara--
-Shut up!

39:40.679 --> 39:44.516
Shut up! You do not
get to say her name.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.284
Offering it up
to whoever's there.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.956
Tricking me
into kissing you.

39:52.557 --> 39:56.193
I didn't--
I didn't mean to--

39:56.226 --> 39:59.931
What I'm saying,
I can't make--
Kennedy?

40:01.599 --> 40:04.702
I can't hold on.
He's winning.

40:04.735 --> 40:07.606
-No.
-I'm being punished.

40:09.173 --> 40:11.643
I-- I kissed you just--
just for a second,

40:11.677 --> 40:14.813
but it-- it was enough.

40:14.846 --> 40:18.583
I let her go.
I didn't mean to.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.385
-Kissing me didn't mean that--
-No!

40:20.418 --> 40:24.489
She was never gone.
She was with me.

40:26.992 --> 40:30.228
We should have been forever.

40:30.260 --> 40:33.664
And I-- I let her be dead.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.670
She's really dead.
And I killed her.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.539
Willow, no.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.976
Please, baby.
I'm so sorry.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.847
WARREN:
Come back! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

40:48.880 --> 40:50.715
Come back!

40:52.951 --> 40:54.786
Willow.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.824
I don't think you did
anything wrong.

40:58.856 --> 41:00.958
This is just magic.

41:00.992 --> 41:04.862
And I think I'm figuring
the whole magic thing out.

41:04.896 --> 41:08.833
-It's just like fairy tales.
-What are you doing?

41:08.867 --> 41:11.036
Bringing you back to life.

41:31.657 --> 41:34.893
(sighs)
Hmm.

41:34.925 --> 41:36.827
I am good.

41:39.030 --> 41:42.166
It's me? I'm back?

41:43.367 --> 41:45.704
Oh, God.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.739
Are you all right?

41:51.677 --> 41:53.612
I have no idea.

42:00.385 --> 42:01.786
I'm so tired.

42:02.753 --> 42:04.054
Yeah.

42:05.422 --> 42:07.425
I'll make you some tea.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.572
(theme music playing)

42:37.588 --> 42:39.389
Grr! Arrgh!
