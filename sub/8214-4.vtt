WEBVTT

00:05.100 --> 00:05.896
Time's running out.

00:05.930 --> 00:07.397
Ray Allen for three
at the buzzer.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.566
Yes!
Oh!

00:08.600 --> 00:10.033
Heat win by two.

00:10.070 --> 00:12.129
Carmelo with a running hook!

00:20.680 --> 00:21.647
CARRIE:
You're forgetting.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.817
I hit the Red Sox

00:22.850 --> 00:24.181
on Wednesday.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.256
Plus, I nailed that
three-team parlay

00:26.290 --> 00:29.828
of the A's, Jays and
the Reds on Friday, right?

00:29.860 --> 00:32.055
Which would put
my new total at...

00:33.660 --> 00:37.266
See, that is a very
nice number, Zeke.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.632
All right, give me the Mets
tonight, two times.

00:39.670 --> 00:40.637
Okay.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.809
Bye.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.262
That was my bank.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.402
Your bank's not
like my bank.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.476
Oh, you have no idea.

00:47.510 --> 00:48.329
So what do we got?

00:48.380 --> 00:51.599
Old guy took a noser
from the 12th floor.

00:51.650 --> 00:52.742
Eliot has us out here

00:52.780 --> 00:54.247
because he's some
big-shot doctor

00:54.280 --> 00:55.440
on the faculty
at Algonquian.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.448
What's his name?

00:57.490 --> 00:58.843
Uh, hold on.

00:58.890 --> 01:01.154
Lustig.
Eugene Lustig.

01:01.190 --> 01:03.226
LUSTIG:
"So while we will always

01:03.260 --> 01:05.387
"gaze ahead with wonder

01:05.430 --> 01:08.319
"at the great uncharted
terrain of the future,

01:08.360 --> 01:10.396
"I believe it will
soon be pOSSIble,

01:10.430 --> 01:12.739
"by unlocking
the secrets of memory,

01:12.770 --> 01:15.637
"to turn our gaze behind us

01:15.670 --> 01:19.276
"and bathe in new sunlight

01:19.310 --> 01:22.108
the hidden landscapes
of our past."

01:22.150 --> 01:23.276
Thank you.

01:25.850 --> 01:27.545
MAN:
I'm so sorry, folks,

01:27.580 --> 01:29.548
Dr. Lustig has
another engagement.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.340
Thank you so much
for coming.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.687
LUSTIG: Bye-bye.
Take care. Thanks.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.153
CARRIE: _
Dr. Lustig. HI.

01:33.190 --> 01:34.555
I'm sorry, Dr. Lustig
has a plane to catch.

01:34.590 --> 01:37.150
Dr. Lustig, I just need
to talk to you for one minute.

01:37.190 --> 01:39.294
"Thank you for your
kind words, Chancellor.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.218
"It's great to be
back at my alma mater

01:41.260 --> 01:43.296
"under such
a bluebird sky.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.524
"30 years ago,

01:44.570 --> 01:46.788
"when the late Professor
Ed Hartung introduced me

01:46.840 --> 01:48.796
to the mysteries
of the human memory..."

01:48.840 --> 01:51.400
This is the speech I gave
at Cornell last week.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.305
It hasn't been
published yet.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.807
_Did someone
give you a copy?

01:54.840 --> 01:56.671
No.

01:58.550 --> 02:01.246
I think I'll, uh,
catch a later flight.

02:11.730 --> 02:13.425
Jo?

02:13.460 --> 02:14.825
Hi.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.566
I saw him speak at the Y.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.295
He was very impressive.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.469
Yes, he was.

02:21.940 --> 02:23.601
Pushed, jumped

02:23.640 --> 02:25.699
or fell-- that is the question.

02:25.740 --> 02:26.934
In my opinion,

02:26.980 --> 02:29.346
his injuries are
consistent with a high fall,

02:29.380 --> 02:30.802
but anything else,

02:30.850 --> 02:32.715
tomorrow will tell.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.518
Did they, um...
did they see anything?

02:38.550 --> 02:40.586
The landing, not the dismount.

02:41.590 --> 02:43.478
Al, I-I knew him.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.623
It was 2004.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.799
Year and a half after...

02:48.830 --> 02:51.628
I quit the force.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.297
Quit you.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.466
I was a wreck.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.331
I mean, every, uh...

02:56.370 --> 02:58.235
every bad thing
that had ever happened to me,

02:58.270 --> 02:59.874
every mistake I had ever made

02:59.910 --> 03:02.743
was running in my head
on a loop.

03:06.450 --> 03:07.678
And then I heard about

03:07.720 --> 03:10.587
this neurologist,
Eugene Lustig, and...

03:12.020 --> 03:14.659
So I tracked him down.

03:14.690 --> 03:16.658
I figured, you know,
why not...

03:16.690 --> 03:19.523
donate my body to science
before I was dead?

03:21.530 --> 03:23.669
Maybe in the process,
I wouldn't crack up.

03:23.700 --> 03:27.397
Then I-I joined
a research group,

03:27.440 --> 03:29.260
with ﬁve other people.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.561
The first of
what became known as

03:30.610 --> 03:33.704
Highly Superior
Autobiographical Memory.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.503
HSAM.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.246
Were you still
in touch with him?

03:37.280 --> 03:39.646
No, not for years.
It's...

03:42.520 --> 03:46.411
Gene Lustig is the reason
I didn't crack up.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.625
Not exactly lived-in.

03:53.660 --> 03:56.595
You'd expect
a few books at least.

03:56.630 --> 03:57.824
Know if he was married?

03:57.870 --> 03:59.599
He was.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.789
Getting divorced,
actually.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.398
I just talked to the neighbor.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.737
She said Lustig moved in
a month ago

04:03.770 --> 04:04.839
after breaking up with his wife.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.406
Neighbor know him well?

04:06.440 --> 04:08.772
It occurred to me,
but she says no.

04:08.810 --> 04:10.277
But she did say
Lustig was having

04:10.310 --> 04:11.277
a bunch of health problems,

04:11.310 --> 04:13.039
was down in
the dumps lately.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.718
And judging by
how clean this place is--

04:14.750 --> 04:16.889
no sign of struggle
or forced entry--

04:16.920 --> 04:18.012
kind of makes you wonder.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.779
What are you saying

04:22.590 --> 04:24.956
You find a suicide note?

04:24.990 --> 04:26.696
Any kind of drugs
for depression?

04:26.730 --> 04:28.994
No, but, you know,
still doesn't mean...

04:29.030 --> 04:30.520
Then I'm not buying it.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.561
AL:
Railing's too high.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.034
We can_ cross
off "accndent."

04:44.480 --> 04:45.549
WEBSTER:
...came down 12 stories.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.514
Pushed, jumped or fell...

04:47.550 --> 04:49.745
There was a geranium
right there.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.609
There was a plant.

04:50.650 --> 04:51.844
How you got geranium,
I don't know.

04:51.890 --> 04:54.051
Because I saw it down below.

04:54.090 --> 04:56.320
Bits of clay, dirt...

04:59.660 --> 05:03.619
Gene's attacker...

05:03.670 --> 05:06.537
rushes him and
throws hIm over,

05:06.570 --> 05:07.889
but Gene grabs
on to the railing.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.760
So in order
to break his grip,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.835
the attacker picks up the
first thing he can find,

05:11.870 --> 05:13.508
and... smash.

05:13.540 --> 05:15.474
The flower pot
goes over, too.

05:15.510 --> 05:17.774
We don't know the flower pot
is connected to this,

05:17.810 --> 05:19.675
we don't know how many
people were involved,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.540
we don't know for sure
he didn't jump.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.787
We'll get Webster on it,

05:23.820 --> 05:25.640
and CSU will take a look
at the clay fragments.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.487
I knew Gene Lustig.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.351
He was one of the most
pOSItlve, Vibrant people

05:29.390 --> 05:30.584
I have ever met.

05:30.630 --> 05:31.881
He gave me hope
when I had none,

05:31.930 --> 05:34.353
and that's not
easy to do.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.722
He didn't commit suicide.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.011
Three fingers are broken,

05:57.050 --> 05:58.608
each between the first
and second knuckle.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.983
Also...

06:02.020 --> 06:06.753
I found topsoil in his scalp
and under his shirt collar.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.463
Absent your flower pot theory,
I came up with nothing.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.388
His neighbor said he had
some kind of health problems.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.169
Did you find anything?
Oh.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.031
Jumped right out at me.

06:16.070 --> 06:17.537
He had cancer.

06:17.570 --> 06:18.537
Cancer?

06:18.570 --> 06:19.537
Mm-hmm.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.899
See those little white dots?

06:20.940 --> 06:22.441
Radioactive tubes.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.549
Brachytherapy.

06:23.580 --> 06:24.672
Prostate cancer.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.143
Exactly.
Treated early,

06:26.180 --> 06:28.444
the success rate is...

06:28.480 --> 06:30.846
95% after 15 years.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.915
So then that would not
be a reason

06:32.960 --> 06:34.757
for him to jump off a balcony.

06:34.790 --> 06:35.757
Right.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.849
Oh, Carrie, I'm so sorry.

06:37.890 --> 06:39.494
Al told me you knew him.

06:39.530 --> 06:42.090
Were you his student?

06:42.130 --> 06:44.064
More like his object of study.

06:44.100 --> 06:47.490
I can't imagine
you being a lab rat.

06:47.540 --> 06:48.461
I was difficult.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.730
I tried to chew through
the bars on my cage.

06:52.010 --> 06:54.205
Look, I know I'm not
the detective on this,

06:54.240 --> 06:55.172
but I'm with you.

06:55.210 --> 06:57.508
Your friend had help
going over that balcony.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.474
Carrie!
Oh.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.147
: Sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.543
Hi. That's okay.

07:04.590 --> 07:05.739
May I call you Carrie?

07:05.790 --> 07:06.814
Yeah, sure, sure.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.884
Great. Come on.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.524
I want to tell you all about

07:09.560 --> 07:11.858
this little study
I've dreamed up.
Okay.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.450
No needles, no electrodes,
I assure you.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.558
Oh, well, that's...
that's a relief.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.058
Just simple questions
to gauge the capacity

07:19.100 --> 07:20.897
of your marvelous mind.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.465
I don't know
about "marvelous."

07:23.510 --> 07:25.239
Save the modesty
for Terry Gross.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.135
This is science.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.876
Next week, I want to have you
meet the others.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.047
Others?

07:31.080 --> 07:33.947
Yeah, the other study subjects.

07:33.980 --> 07:37.689
Oh, did you think
you were alone?

07:45.930 --> 07:47.522
It's okay.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.754
You can go.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.267
I'll take good care of him.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.722
Thanks, Jo.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.803
Nothing on the surveillance
video from Lustig's building.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.138
The camera in the lobby
shows him entering alone.

08:02.180 --> 08:04.068
No cameras at all in
the basement or garage.

08:04.110 --> 08:05.748
Any prints off
the flower pot?

08:05.780 --> 08:07.577
CSU has to
reassemble it first.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.848
We're talking pellets.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.711
I wouldn't
hold your breath.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.786
Well, it looks like
the ex-wife's clean.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.651
Friends say the divorce
was amicable,

08:14.690 --> 08:16.282
and she's been in Europe
for five weeks.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.218
So she's out of
the picture.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.285
But I wouldn't come to you
without something.

08:19.330 --> 08:22.527
Been digging around
at the university.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.130
Meet Alwyn Pierce.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.058
Assistant Professor of Neurology
at Algonquian.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.068
Former graduate student
of our Dr. Lustig.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.533
Something of a protg.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.299
Lustig had high hopes
for this lady.

08:32.340 --> 08:33.637
Apparently she had
high hopes, too,

08:33.680 --> 08:34.738
but they never panned out.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.941
According to some of
the faculty members I spoke to,

08:36.980 --> 08:38.049
she was pretty difficult.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.014
Just last month,
she was denied tenure.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.574
How'd she take it?

08:41.620 --> 08:42.644
Notgood.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.646
It all blew up at
a faculty meeting a week ago.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.317
She accused Lustig
of rigging the vote.

08:46.350 --> 08:48.079
Did she?
She did.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.224
And according to folks at that
meeting, she really went off.

08:50.260 --> 08:51.249
They had to call

08:51.290 --> 08:52.848
campus security.

08:56.230 --> 08:57.299
CARRIE:
Alwyn?

08:57.330 --> 08:58.661
Alwyn Pierce?

09:00.840 --> 09:02.762
Carrie Wells.
Yeah, we met years ago,

09:02.810 --> 09:04.630
in Gene's first HSAM study.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.308
Yes, I know. I remember.

09:06.340 --> 09:07.671
Lieutenant Al Burns.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.769
Of course.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.107
You're here because of Gene.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.118
You guys worked together
for a long time.

09:13.150 --> 09:14.572
This must be hard for you.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.973
It is.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.089
AL:
Though we understand

09:17.120 --> 09:18.644
you two had
your differences lately.

09:18.690 --> 09:21.818
Perhaps, but
professional squabbles

09:21.860 --> 09:24.078
seem irrelevant
at times like these.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.927
CARRIE:
As opposed to a week ago,

09:25.960 --> 09:26.995
when professional squabbles

09:27.030 --> 09:29.248
led to you being escorted
from a faculty meeting

09:29.300 --> 09:30.961
by four security guards.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.037
I worked with Gene
for ten years.

09:34.070 --> 09:36.095
And I felt I earned his support.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.005
Instead, he blackballed me.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.634
So draw your own conclusions
about our "differences."

09:40.680 --> 09:42.033
Why would he blackball you?

09:42.080 --> 09:43.377
I have no idea.

09:43.410 --> 09:45.674
If he were alive,
you could ask him yourself.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.974
You know, we don't
need to ask him.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.284
According to a transcript
from the tenure committee,

09:50.320 --> 09:52.140
Gene thought
your work displayed--

09:52.190 --> 09:54.818
and I don't think
I'm getting this wrong--

09:54.860 --> 09:56.213
"a shoddy methodology

09:56.260 --> 09:57.750
bordering on fraudulent."

09:57.790 --> 09:59.382
Now, that... that had to hurt.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.796
That was a joke.

10:01.830 --> 10:03.695
Especially since his work

10:03.730 --> 10:04.697
was sloppy and mediocre.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.368
I was a part of Gene's work.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.994
There was nothing mediocre
or sloppy about it.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.032
Where you were between the hours
of 6:00 and 7:00 this morning?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.230
Wait a minute.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.838
I got denied tenure,

10:14.880 --> 10:16.006
and I blame Eugene Lustig,

10:16.040 --> 10:17.678
but I sure as hell
didn't kill him.

10:17.710 --> 10:20.019
_ You sure as hell _
didn't answer my question.

10:20.050 --> 10:23.281
I was asleep,
in my bed, by myself.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.049
You need proof, talk to my cat.

10:25.090 --> 10:27.718
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a class to teach.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.785
ELIOT:
She make any physical threats?

10:31.830 --> 10:33.320
"I'll ruin your life.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.759
"You'll regret
what you've done.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.892
You'll be sorry."
That sort of thing.

10:35.930 --> 10:38.160
Sounds like my daily staff
meeting at the mayor's office.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.690
Anything else?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.059
Well, we're trying to find
something more concrete,

10:41.100 --> 10:43.432
see if we can work up a warrant
to search her place.

10:43.470 --> 10:45.199
Please, Burns,
with all deliberate speed?

10:45.240 --> 10:47.800
Algonquian University
pumps $9 billion

10:47.840 --> 10:49.330
into this city's
economy every year.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.871
I know, I thought it was
a typo, too. It's not.

10:51.910 --> 10:53.946
Having this on the front page
of The Times

10:53.980 --> 10:56.175
irritates the mayor,
who then irritates me.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.380
That's a lot
of irritation.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.739
You need more on this woman,

10:58.790 --> 11:00.052
and you're not gonna
find it here.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.115
Would it help to know
that she's a thief?

11:02.160 --> 11:02.922
Check this out.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.827
I followed up
with campus security.

11:05.860 --> 11:07.794
Got them to give me
all the Neuro Lab

11:07.830 --> 11:08.922
surveillance footage
since that faculty meeting

11:08.960 --> 11:09.858
where Alvwn went off.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.425
2:30 a.m., one day
after the tenure meeting.

11:12.470 --> 11:13.391
Alwyn enters the lab,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.829
and she heads for a cabinet
by Lustig's desk.

11:15.870 --> 11:17.337
She opens the cabinet.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.742
Right there. That box.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.702
Security say she was authorized
to be there?

11:24.750 --> 11:26.149
Definitely not.

11:26.180 --> 11:28.478
That's trespassing.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.782
Forget the search warrant.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.788
Go pick her up.
Right.

11:37.330 --> 11:41.221
Alwyn Pierce, I repeat,
this is the NYPD.

11:48.370 --> 11:50.065
MURRAY:
Alwyn Pierce?

11:50.110 --> 11:51.839
Alwyn?

12:01.920 --> 12:04.013
Well, we can rule out
your garden-variety robbery.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.881
Money, credit cards,
all here.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.888
No sign of forced entry,
no struggle.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.217
She let them in.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.125
Yeah, that's how
I read it, too.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.527
Her phone shows one
45-second call at 6:30.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.495
Traces back to a pay phone
at a gas station in Brooklyn.

12:17.530 --> 12:20.033
We'll check
for surveillance cams.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.116
Al?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.212
That's the box Alvwn took
from Lustig's office.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.854
CARRIE: These are tapes
from Gene's HSAM study--

12:44.890 --> 12:46.790
from my HSAM study.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.096
December 3rd was a Friday.

12:51.130 --> 12:52.461
I got off early, so I went

12:52.500 --> 12:55.492
to a 4:30 show
of Unbreakable.

12:55.540 --> 12:57.428
With a friend?
Alone.

12:57.470 --> 12:59.062
It was at the
Syracuse Odeon.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.077
Wow, it was cheap.

13:00.110 --> 13:01.270
It was four bucks.

13:01.310 --> 13:02.572
Any trailers?

13:02.610 --> 13:04.805
Previews. We call them
trailers in New York.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.340
CARRIE: No, I know,
I know what they are.

13:06.380 --> 13:07.517
You all right?

13:07.550 --> 13:09.279
Yeah.
It's just weird, you know?

13:09.320 --> 13:11.083
One thing to
remember something,

13:11.120 --> 13:15.557
it's another thing to
actually see yourself.

13:15.590 --> 13:18.479
That girl doesn't exist anymore.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.327
Those were tough years,

13:20.360 --> 13:21.850
after Syracuse.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.289
Wish I'd been
there to help.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.389
I had to learn to help myself.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.365
Okay, enough of this.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.004
What does it matter if I had
blueberries on my oatmeal

13:33.040 --> 13:35.406
five years, two months,
three weeks ago on a Friday?

13:35.440 --> 13:36.475
Come on, Carrie.

13:36.510 --> 13:37.477
And I didn't.

13:37.510 --> 13:38.477
I had bananas.

13:38.510 --> 13:40.011
Do you see, Gene?

13:40.050 --> 13:41.449
It's relentless!
It doesn't stop!

13:41.480 --> 13:44.586
Carrie, people like me,
our experiences,

13:44.620 --> 13:47.350
all our little joys,
just slip through our fingers.

13:47.390 --> 13:49.312
You get to hold on to them.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.486
You should
celebrate that.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.555
I can't let them go!

13:52.590 --> 13:55.024
You keep telling me
how wonderful it is

13:55.060 --> 13:57.164
that I remember everything.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.498
I can't... forget.

13:59.530 --> 14:01.088
There's a difference.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.361
Sometimes you forget.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.264
Never!
Once.

14:06.310 --> 14:08.175
Your sister, Rachel.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.474
Would it help you

14:10.510 --> 14:12.239
to know why?

14:14.050 --> 14:15.369
Yes.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.081
You're all struggling.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.212
You know Todd?

14:18.250 --> 14:19.319
The loud guy.

14:19.350 --> 14:23.923
He likes to scramble up
big rocks without a rope.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.088
And beautiful,
gentle Lena?

14:27.130 --> 14:28.392
She's seen
Terms of Endearment,

14:28.430 --> 14:30.466
like, 400 times.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.593
Cries her eyes out
every single time.

14:32.630 --> 14:35.133
And you and Ruth,

14:35.170 --> 14:36.296
you like gambling, right?
Okay.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.638
High stakes poker,
blackjack?
Yes. So?

14:38.670 --> 14:41.673
So, we don't know the
science exactly yet,

14:41.710 --> 14:45.373
but_under the influence
of intense experience,

14:45.410 --> 14:47.674
the brain is flooded
with adrenaline.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.042
That's a key building
block of memory.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.513
Too much adrenaline...

14:53.560 --> 14:56.313
it erases memory.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.022
There's a name for _it:
psychogenic amne5ia.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.028
Kind of like a memory hole?

15:01.060 --> 15:02.925
Exactly.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.188
Jumping off bridges
on a bungee cord,

15:05.230 --> 15:10.031
betting the house
on red 22...

15:10.070 --> 15:11.958
the death of
a loved one...

15:14.380 --> 15:16.029
The most loved one.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.408
You memory guys are
all risk takers,

15:24.450 --> 15:25.610
adrenaline junkies.

15:25.650 --> 15:29.051
The rush engenders

15:29.090 --> 15:32.059
a little benign
forgetting.

15:32.090 --> 15:34.456
So what you're saying...

15:38.400 --> 15:41.961
But listen, if in
your leisure hours

15:42.000 --> 15:43.536
you're planning
to play with fire,

15:43.570 --> 15:45.538
just do me a favor, huh?

15:47.540 --> 15:48.632
Don't get burned?

15:48.680 --> 15:50.341
Don't get caught.

15:56.150 --> 15:58.118
Hey, Carrie,

15:58.150 --> 16:00.618
you got any idea why

16:00.660 --> 16:03.356
Alwyn would have been tracking
your old memory jocks?

16:03.390 --> 16:04.618
I followed up on

16:04.660 --> 16:05.581
all those phone records,

16:05.630 --> 16:08.224
and in the days after
she stole the tapes,

16:08.260 --> 16:12.469
Alwyn contacted Todd Blasingame,
Ruth Meaney and Dale Parsons.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.730
All participants in
your study with Lustig, right?

16:14.770 --> 16:17.068
I don't know why she didn't call
the other three.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.499
Well, Lena committed suicide
a year after the memory study,

16:19.540 --> 16:22.008
Tomas moved to Korea to study

16:22.040 --> 16:23.302
being a Buddhist monk.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.305
Still leaves you.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.544
Maybe she did call.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.639
Yo_ur old number
in Syracuse.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.113
By now, it would be
assigned to someone else.

16:29.150 --> 16:30.549
The question is: why?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.080
Why did she call?

16:32.120 --> 16:34.554
We got to talk to them.

16:35.590 --> 16:36.614
I got a feeling
we find out

16:36.660 --> 16:38.582
what Alwyn was looking for,
we find our killer.

16:40.330 --> 16:41.627
WOMAN:
Hi. May I help you?

16:41.660 --> 16:44.163
Yeah, we're here
to see Dale Parsons.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.122
WOMAN: Oh, he's actually busy
with a client right now.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.330
With you in a sec, Carrie.

16:47.370 --> 16:49.429
Haven't seen this guy
in nine years?

16:49.470 --> 16:52.359
That's why it's called
"highly superior memory," Al.

16:52.410 --> 16:53.377
PARSONS:
Sorry.

16:53.410 --> 16:54.536
Got a bear of an audit.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.434
Some clients,
they just never learn.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.243
Carrie Wells.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.474
Love your new look.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.216
So... unencumbered.

17:02.350 --> 17:03.317
Dale Parsons.

17:03.350 --> 17:04.612
Al Burns, NYPD.

17:04.650 --> 17:05.787
Ah, you're here about Alwyn.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.119
Gene, too.
So sad.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.458
But I-I read that
that was a suicide.

17:10.490 --> 17:12.355
Do you think
that they're connected?

17:12.390 --> 17:14.699
You know, she called me
last Monday.

17:14.730 --> 17:15.822
Really

17:15.860 --> 17:19.489
She tried to recruit me
for some follow-up HSAM study.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.669
Chance to make a name
for herself,

17:21.700 --> 17:22.837
I suppose.

17:22.870 --> 17:24.735
She was always
pretty ambitious, Alwyn.

17:24.770 --> 17:27.136
I mean, even as a grad student.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.637
Remember, Carrie, when she asked
Lustig if she could sit in

17:29.680 --> 17:31.545
on Ruth Meaney's
second interview?

17:31.580 --> 17:32.808
Yeah, how could
I forget?

17:32.850 --> 17:33.839
January 19, 2004.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.370
It was Monday.

17:35.420 --> 17:36.512
Around 11:15.

17:36.550 --> 17:38.086
11:16.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.644
Fifteen.

17:39.690 --> 17:41.419
If you say so.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.654
I do.

17:42.690 --> 17:47.252
So, Alwyn...
what'd you tell her?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.120
Well, I said,
"Please, get back in a room

17:49.160 --> 17:49.956
with those lemon heads?"

17:50.000 --> 17:51.262
Who you calling
a lemon head, Dale?

17:51.300 --> 17:53.530
Who's got time, anyway?

17:53.570 --> 17:54.662
Did Professor Pierce talk about

17:54.700 --> 17:56.292
her relationship
with Dr. Lustig?

17:56.340 --> 17:57.136
Not a word.

17:57.170 --> 17:59.263
She just said
that she was trying

17:59.310 --> 18:00.379
to update an earlier study.

18:00.410 --> 18:01.377
And like I said, I told her
thanks, but no thanks.

18:01.410 --> 18:03.674
I'd say, "Call if you remember
anything else,"

18:03.710 --> 18:05.371
but I've learned
there's no p0int.

18:06.510 --> 18:08.444
It's good to see you again,
Carrie, and a pleasure

18:08.480 --> 18:10.619
to meet you, Al,
but I must say,

18:10.650 --> 18:12.618
you're not exactly
as Carrie described you.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.515
Mary, can you give me a hand
with the Elderton?

18:14.560 --> 18:17.449
So how is it I came up
in your memory study?

18:17.490 --> 18:19.481
Gene wanted us _
to deal With some memories

18:19.530 --> 18:20.827
accompanied by
strong emotions.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.851
And how exactly
did you describe me?

18:22.900 --> 18:25.528
Well, I'm not really sure.

18:25.570 --> 18:26.719
You don't remember?

18:26.770 --> 18:28.397
All right, fine.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.863
I may have given you...

18:30.910 --> 18:33.606
a lisp, a wandering eye
and really bad dandruff.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.631
But we had broken up,
and I was mad.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.240
Nice.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.804
Let's go, lemon head.

18:39.850 --> 18:41.818
Hey, Vita Club members,
Todd Blasingame coming at you

18:41.850 --> 18:45.217
from beautiful, beautiful
San Marco Key.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.356
Now, did you know my limited
production Memory Serum contains

18:48.390 --> 18:49.584
the fermented extracts

18:49.620 --> 18:52.521
of over 38 tropical fruits
and berries?

18:52.560 --> 18:54.721
MAN: Cut! All right, guys,
let's reset it back to one.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.398
Lauren, honey,
I'm gonna need a touch-up.

18:56.430 --> 18:57.362
I'm sorry.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.368
So you were asking me
about poor Alwyn Pierce.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.368
Yeah. Did you speak with her
in the last week?

19:01.400 --> 19:03.561
No, but I saw her name
on my call list.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.362
Hundred calls a day,
can't return them all.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.537
Hmm. Any idea why
she was calling?

19:07.580 --> 19:08.706
Thanks, hon. I'm good.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.503
Not a clue.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.541
Go ahead.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.741
Hit me.
Hit you?

19:14.780 --> 19:15.769
Yeah, you know,
with the question.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.186
You know, where was I
the night of blah

19:18.220 --> 19:20.359
Okay. Monday morning,
Tuesday night,

19:20.390 --> 19:21.550
where were you,
Mr. Blasingame?

19:21.590 --> 19:23.319
Call me Todd.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.452
Norway.

19:24.490 --> 19:25.787
You were in Norway?

19:25.830 --> 19:27.627
Jus got back this morning.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.491
Have you ever
heard of Trollveggen?

19:29.530 --> 19:30.792
3,600-foot

19:30.830 --> 19:32.468
vertical cliff.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.899
Outstanding!

19:33.940 --> 19:35.498
I BASE

19:35.540 --> 19:37.929
So when's the last _time
you saw Dr. Lustig?

19:37.970 --> 19:40.370
February 17, 2009. Tuesday.

19:40.410 --> 19:41.604
That was the day I settled

19:41.640 --> 19:43.540
that little nuisance lawsuit
he cooked up.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.377
Hmm, he didn't want you
using his name

19:45.410 --> 19:46.809
in promotion for
your memory products.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.772
JAY:
$500,000 in punitive

19:48.820 --> 19:51.288
and lawyer fees,
Mr. Blasing...

19:51.320 --> 19:53.515
Sorry. Todd.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.959
Weren't you even
a little upset?

19:56.890 --> 19:59.256
You see that?

19:59.290 --> 20:00.894
And I'm not talking
about the beauties.

20:00.930 --> 20:03.467
This uses your
body's own energy

20:03.500 --> 20:05.468
to locate areas
that are stressed.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.934
This little puppy has
already made me three mil,

20:07.970 --> 20:09.858
and I haven't even
shipped a one of 'em.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.436
I don't think
I'm upset at anyone.

20:11.470 --> 20:13.233
MAN: Okay, Todd,
let's get another one.
Thank you.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.635
You know, I am starting
to understand why

20:15.680 --> 20:17.500
Carrie didn't stay in touch
with these memory folks.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.575
Yeah, you hold on
to everything long enough,

20:19.610 --> 20:21.840
it's easy to forget
anyone else is out there.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.485
From Mr. Blasingame,
with his compliments.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.324
TV ANNOUNCER:
And they're heading to the gates

20:30.360 --> 20:31.782
for race number six.

20:31.830 --> 20:32.979
Number three horse...

20:33.030 --> 20:35.590
Carrie Wells,
as I live and drink.

20:35.630 --> 20:37.325
Ruth Meaney.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.533
...number seven, Rosso Brew,
with jockey Juan Marquez...

20:40.570 --> 20:44.404
Whatever happened
to blackjack?

20:44.440 --> 20:45.634
Are you kidding?

20:45.670 --> 20:47.604
My picture's up
in every casino

20:47.640 --> 20:48.732
all across the country.

20:48.780 --> 20:49.906
There they go.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.999
And it's Vital Jack
down the inside...

20:52.050 --> 20:53.540
Who you got?

20:53.580 --> 20:55.445
Claire's Knee, number six.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.347
I got no memory edge
for the ponies.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.689
And so what
if he ran 2:11 in the mud

21:01.720 --> 21:03.551
a year ago Tuesday?

21:03.590 --> 21:05.353
Look at him now.

21:06.860 --> 21:10.694
With all the booze and dope
I've sucked up,

21:10.730 --> 21:14.063
you'd think I'd be brain-dead.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.034
No such luck.

21:16.070 --> 21:18.630
Rosso Brew and _Vital Jack
are battling it out!

21:18.670 --> 21:20.399
And it is Vital Jack...

21:20.440 --> 21:21.509
Run, you schmuck.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.472
Did you hear about Alwyn?

21:29.550 --> 21:31.484
I'm afraid so, yeah.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.782
Come on.

21:32.820 --> 21:36.517
_ She claimed
Lustig goosed the results

21:36.560 --> 21:38.380
of the memory tests.

21:38.430 --> 21:42.321
Oh, you know, try to make it
all seem more impressive,

21:42.360 --> 21:44.624
make a bigger splash,
dazzle the world.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.661
He would never do that.

21:46.700 --> 21:47.735
He was a legitimate
scientist.

21:47.770 --> 21:48.862
Well, you're telling me.

21:48.900 --> 21:52.768
But Alwyn had an axe to grind.

21:52.810 --> 21:55.335
Now, she asked me

21:55.380 --> 21:58.941
if Lustig
ever put me up to lying.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.809
Well, did he?

22:02.850 --> 22:05.011
Oh, come on, no!

22:06.450 --> 22:07.678
Well, Alwyn thought he did.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.757
Well, that-that would be crazy.

22:10.790 --> 22:13.691
Of course it's crazy.

22:13.730 --> 22:16.597
But... I guess there was someone

22:16.630 --> 22:19.895
who told one big old whopper.

22:19.930 --> 22:22.034
Someone in our group lied?

22:22.070 --> 22:23.435
VVho?

22:23.470 --> 22:25.609
Alwyn wouldn't say.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.608
But, um...

22:27.640 --> 22:30.905
Well, it was that
one group session we had

22:30.950 --> 22:33.100
is all I know.

22:33.150 --> 22:34.913
Thank you, Ruthie.

22:34.950 --> 22:38.681
You and me, Carrie,
we could break the bank.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.052
oéh.

22:41.090 --> 22:42.682
Make a hell of a team.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.052
Unstoppable,
indestructible.

22:45.090 --> 22:46.079
Whoa.

22:46.130 --> 22:47.995
Carrie, what's up?

22:48.030 --> 22:50.669
We have to look
at the group se55ion.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.099
What group session?

22:52.130 --> 22:54.769
There was only one:
January 20, all six of us.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.597
Lustig wanted to see
if we could influence

22:56.640 --> 22:57.834
each other's recollections.

22:57.870 --> 23:00.009
Uh, I'm not
seeing it, Carrie.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.598
There's no tape for that day.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.902
Check again; there has to be.

23:02.940 --> 23:06.842
Nope. January 15,
January 19, January 23.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.142
Okay, well, I know

23:08.180 --> 23:11.980
there was a session on the 20th,
which means...

23:12.020 --> 23:13.817
someone stole that tape

23:13.860 --> 23:14.781
from Alwyn's apartment.

23:14.820 --> 23:16.856
What's so important
about that one session?

23:16.890 --> 23:20.087
Alwyn thought someone lied
about a memory.

23:20.130 --> 23:24.464
Whatever is on that tape
got her and Gene killed.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.539
Carrie, what's going on?

23:29.570 --> 23:30.901
Carrie?

23:36.210 --> 23:37.575
We got no witnesses
from the street

23:37.610 --> 23:39.043
or surrounding buildings.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.617
We're looking for footage
from secams, traffic cameras,

23:41.650 --> 23:43.208
anything that might
have picked up the car.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.047
Thanks. Stay on it.
Yeah.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.014
ELIOT: So, we know this
group session was taped,

23:48.060 --> 23:50.153
but we don't know what's on it,
and now it's gone?

23:50.190 --> 23:51.179
It's not gone.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.857
WEBSTER:
Hold still, please.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.495
My work is so much better
when my patients aren't moving.

23:55.530 --> 23:58.192
We have a copy here.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.027
Yeah, we don't need the tape.

24:00.070 --> 24:02.163
I got it in my memory.

24:04.140 --> 24:05.562
What do you need?

24:05.610 --> 24:07.601
Uh, candles,
uh, what, some music?

24:07.640 --> 24:09.505
No, no, we just...

24:09.540 --> 24:11.144
a stenographer
and a pad of paper

24:11.180 --> 24:12.147
would be great.

24:12.180 --> 24:14.478
You know, it's not a massage,
just remembering.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.715
Great. We'll set you up.

24:19.120 --> 24:23.216
It was the first time
he put us all together--

24:23.260 --> 24:24.227
the only time.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.750
He brought us

24:25.790 --> 24:30.124
all in a room,
sat us in a circle.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.628
All right, everyone,

24:32.670 --> 24:34.160
I am gonna ask
about your memories...

24:34.200 --> 24:36.589
CARRIE: And asked us about
memories from random days.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.564
Uh, the first one was
January 17,

24:39.610 --> 24:40.679
1991.

24:40.710 --> 24:41.779
Tomas said,

24:41.810 --> 24:43.778
"That would've been a Thursday.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.040
I had a history test
and a term paper."

24:46.080 --> 24:47.968
Todd interrupted.
It was the start
of Desert Storm.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.045
Right, I was going to say.
And, uh...

24:50.080 --> 24:52.116
"And I was sitting down
to study, but my mom..."

24:52.150 --> 24:54.050
Then Gene asked about
February 11,

24:54.090 --> 24:55.557
1999.

24:55.590 --> 24:56.955
First to Ruth.

24:56.990 --> 24:58.548
Right, of all days.

24:58.590 --> 24:59.750
Sorry?
Ruth said,

24:59.790 --> 25:01.052
"Well, just 'cause
after getting killed

25:01.100 --> 25:02.954
on the Villanova game, which..."

25:03.000 --> 25:04.592
I mean, 111 to 85.

25:04.630 --> 25:05.927
Come on.
"Come on."

25:05.970 --> 25:07.267
Are we talking basketball?

25:07.300 --> 25:08.961
"What do you think?" Ruth said.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.706
Boomerang chucking?

25:10.740 --> 25:12.002
"Yes, basketball, you egghead."

25:12.040 --> 25:13.268
You egghead.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.608
Lena, "Wouldn't you know it,
they were doing

25:15.640 --> 25:17.198
track work
on the Rock Island Line..."

25:17.240 --> 25:18.901
So I had to have Peggy
drive me in.

25:18.950 --> 25:20.076
Peggy?

25:20.110 --> 25:21.247
That's my niece.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.214
Right away, she starts coughing.
"She starts coughing.

25:23.250 --> 25:25.184
"So I said,
'Forget Marshall Field's.

25:25.220 --> 25:26.847
We're going straight
to Dr. Rinaldi."'

25:26.890 --> 25:28.289
"February 11, 1999,

25:28.320 --> 25:29.787
"we got a call about a break-in.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.754
"Little two-story colonial

25:31.790 --> 25:33.189
"with yellow trim
down on Sterling and Coolidge.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.551
"Turns out it was a couple kids

25:35.600 --> 25:37.921
throwing rocks
at the basement windows."

25:37.970 --> 25:39.619
Blasingame, "I mean,
anybody could've told you

25:39.670 --> 25:41.262
the new year was gonna be soft."

25:41.300 --> 25:44.235
So, I turned a profit on Intel
at the open at 63 1/8.

25:44.270 --> 25:45.305
"I rolled it over into..."

25:45.340 --> 25:47.069
...June hogs.

25:47.110 --> 25:47.929
Then Gene asked about...

25:49.880 --> 25:51.939
Dale Parsons...
A Thursday.

25:51.980 --> 25:53.709
"I'd just read an article
how they're getting

25:53.750 --> 25:55.911
record prices at auction houses
for art."

25:55.950 --> 25:59.681
$68.9 million for a van Gogh.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.982
How is that even possible?

26:01.020 --> 26:02.112
"It's just paint, people.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.219
"And since I happened
to be two blocks from the Met,

26:04.260 --> 26:06.319
I go in that afternoon and ask,
'What's the most...'"

26:06.360 --> 26:08.055
"...expensive painting
that you have in here?"

26:08.100 --> 26:09.658
Did you get an answer?

26:09.700 --> 26:11.065
A Vermeer.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.193
Uh, Young Woman
with a Water Pitcher.

26:13.230 --> 26:15.198
"So I went and had a look at it,
and you know what?"

26:15.240 --> 26:17.060
It's a young woman
with a water pitcher.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.829
Tomas said...
I love that painting.

26:18.870 --> 26:19.939
The Gene asked...
Ruth?

26:19.970 --> 26:21.369
I remembered to bring a sweater,

26:21.410 --> 26:22.672
because 1010 WINS...

26:22.710 --> 26:23.904
"...was saying a high of 40.

26:23.950 --> 26:24.803
What they didn't..."

26:24.850 --> 26:26.875
...say, the slq was
gonna crack open.

26:26.910 --> 26:29.674
It was Saturday, and I'd just
gotten my first M3.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.244
"3.2 liter,

26:31.290 --> 26:33.281
"passion-red, beautiful.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.754
Got pinched for doing 48
in a 35 zone."

26:35.790 --> 26:37.929
Which I don't even
consider that speeding.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.258
Gene said,
"You're all amazing."
You're all amazing.

26:40.290 --> 26:42.326
Uh, there's pizza
in the next room.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.759
For those who don't like...

26:43.800 --> 26:45.859
"...pepperoni,
there's ham and pineapple.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.299
Save me a slice."

26:47.330 --> 26:48.695
And...

26:48.740 --> 26:50.298
The end?

26:50.340 --> 26:52.900
The end.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.407
AL:
Thank you.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.341
You okay?

27:00.380 --> 27:02.211
Tired, sad.

27:03.820 --> 27:05.811
You are amazing.

27:08.690 --> 27:11.022
JAY: I'm just saying,
this is a ton of memories.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.129
Which, incredible job,
by the way, Carrie,

27:12.160 --> 27:13.286
but if we're gonna
verify each one,

27:13.330 --> 27:14.297
it's gonna take forever.

27:14.330 --> 27:15.422
AL:
We know Lustig

27:15.460 --> 27:17.325
was able to do it.
No, he wasn't.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.021
He did random spot-checks.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.288
Yeah, see,
but then how did Alvwn do it?

27:21.340 --> 27:22.398
I mean, we're talking

27:22.440 --> 27:23.361
about random details

27:23.400 --> 27:24.958
about track work
on the Long Island Railroad

27:25.010 --> 27:26.159
in 1988.

27:26.210 --> 27:28.178
The price of lamb chops, 1996.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.234
Fourth race at Roosevelt, 1994.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.907
I don't know.

27:30.950 --> 27:34.147
Now, maybe if she was a fan
of the trotters or something.

27:34.180 --> 27:35.408
Maybe she was.

27:35.450 --> 27:38.044
I mean, maybe Alwyn found
an incorrect memory

27:38.090 --> 27:40.149
in no time at all
because it happened to be

27:40.190 --> 27:41.987
in an area of her expertise.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.159
If it was something
that jumped out at her...

27:44.190 --> 27:46.078
MURRAY:
Money, credit cards, all here.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.121
No sign of forced
entry, no struggle.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.321
She let them in.

27:50.360 --> 27:53.329
AL: Yeah, that's
how I read it, too.

27:53.370 --> 27:54.530
Her phone shows one
45-second call...

27:54.570 --> 27:58.404
Traces back to a pay phone
at a gas station in Brooklyn.

28:00.340 --> 28:02.376
She and Lustig may
have been fighting,

28:02.410 --> 28:04.401
but she's got a ton
of his books here.

28:06.350 --> 28:08.818
Art.

28:08.850 --> 28:10.249
Alwyn was an art lover.

28:10.280 --> 28:14.353
Books, museum posters-- they
were all over her apartment.

28:14.390 --> 28:16.358
PARSONS: Since I happened
to be two blocks

28:16.390 --> 28:18.483
from the Metropolitan Museum,
I go in that afternoon.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.419
Vermeer, A Young Woman
with a Water Pitcher.

28:21.460 --> 28:25.863
Parson said he saw a Vermeer
at the Metropolitan.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.094
Young Woman
with a Water Pitcher.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.461
Maybe he got the museum wrong?

28:28.500 --> 28:29.762
JAY:
No, that painting

28:29.800 --> 28:31.062
was at the Met.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.236
My cousin Angie works there.

28:32.270 --> 28:33.339
It's been in the collection
for years.

28:33.370 --> 28:35.031
All right, call her.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.433
My bet is he didn't see it

28:36.480 --> 28:38.368
when he said he did.
March 6, 1997.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.503
Find out if the museum
was closed,

28:40.550 --> 28:42.040
having a private event,
something,

28:42.080 --> 28:43.047
anything.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.286
Hey, Ange, it's me.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.412
You by a computer?

28:45.450 --> 28:47.008
_What if_Parsons
just got it wrong?

28:47.050 --> 28:48.449
People make mistakes.
No one bats a thousand.

28:48.490 --> 28:49.514
Parsons does.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.824
He scored highest
on all of the objective tests.

28:51.860 --> 28:52.952
He beat me.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.992
If he got it wrong,

28:55.030 --> 28:56.349
he's lying.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.867
You rock, Ange. Yep.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.128
March 6, 1997.

29:00.430 --> 29:01.931
Young Woman
with a Water Pitcher

29:01.970 --> 29:03.767
was on loan to the Prado Museum
in Madrid.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.004
No way Parsons could've seen it.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.200
He is lying.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.468
And whatever he did that day,

29:07.510 --> 29:08.431
he wants to keep it secret.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.402
He'll kill to keep it secret.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.509
Uh-huh.
Jay,check
the crime's database.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.973
March 6, 1997.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.271
Unsolved murders, anything.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.969
Okay, here we go.

29:17.020 --> 29:19.784
Let's look at
the whole tristate area

29:19.820 --> 29:21.959
and unsolved murders.

29:21.990 --> 29:23.514
Widening the jurisdiction.
Got it.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.552
Four unsolved murders
March 6, 1997.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.524
Now, assuming for the moment
that we're not looking

29:28.560 --> 29:31.097
at a gang-related homicide,
that narrows it down to...

29:31.130 --> 29:33.894
Valerie Johnson, age 21,
CUNY student,

29:33.940 --> 29:36.033
found dead in her car
in Farmingdale.

29:36.070 --> 29:38.163
Strangled with clothesline.

29:42.110 --> 29:44.169
Thanks for meeting me, Dale.

29:44.210 --> 29:46.349
If anyone can help us
with this thing, it's you.

29:46.380 --> 29:48.416
No problem. I got a client
right around the corner,

29:48.450 --> 29:51.442
but I think I already told you
everything that I know.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.583
Well, maybe I can learn more

29:53.620 --> 29:55.850
by picking that
extraordinary brain of yours.

29:55.890 --> 29:59.257
Well, you will certainly
learn something.

29:59.290 --> 30:03.522
But probably not about
what you want to know.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.199
March 6, 1997.

30:06.230 --> 30:07.458
Thursday.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.262
Yes, it was.

30:08.300 --> 30:11.133
What were you doing
that afternoon?

30:11.170 --> 30:13.331
Oh, God, you sound
like Lustig.

30:13.370 --> 30:14.974
I thought this was
about Alwyn.

30:15.010 --> 30:17.501
Well, it is, indirectly.

30:17.540 --> 30:20.100
See, I know what I was doing
that afternoon.

30:20.150 --> 30:23.517
I was buying socks and underwear
at the Syracuse Dress Barn,

30:23.550 --> 30:27.543
which is not the most exciting
or sexy thing in the world,

30:27.590 --> 30:29.012
but at least it's true.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.482
It's not like

30:30.520 --> 30:34.854
the Syracuse Dress Barn
just moved to Madrid.

30:36.030 --> 30:38.021
I'm sorry,
what was the question again?

30:38.070 --> 30:39.628
March 6, 1997.

30:39.670 --> 30:40.932
You told our group...
I'm kidding.

30:40.970 --> 30:43.291
that you were
at the Metropolitan...
Oh, group session, boring.

30:43.340 --> 30:45.160
seeing a painting by Vermeer.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.974
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.

30:48.010 --> 30:49.932
Wow, is that what you remember?

30:49.980 --> 30:51.072
Uh-huh.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.509
Sorry.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.348
No, Carrie,
on Thursday afternoon, March 6,

30:55.380 --> 30:59.043
I was at the 1:45 pm. screening
of Donnie Brasco

30:59.090 --> 31:00.114
at Lincoln Square Cinema.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.651
Afterwards, I had
sushi at Lenge.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.157
By the time I was finished,

31:03.190 --> 31:04.919
I would've had exactly
nine minutes

31:04.960 --> 31:07.258
to get across town to the Met
before it closed.

31:07.290 --> 31:08.951
So how could I have seen
a Vermeer?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.093
PS. I don't even like Vermeer.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.462
You said you saw the painting.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.991
It's your memory against mine.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.462
What about the tapes?

31:17.500 --> 31:18.967
Great, check the tape.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.238
You'll see that I am right.

31:20.270 --> 31:23.398
I could always ask Todd, Ruthie.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.543
Sure, ask them.

31:24.580 --> 31:25.672
But why bother?

31:25.710 --> 31:28.076
You have the tape, don't you?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.270
Don't you?

31:33.620 --> 31:36.282
It's just you against me.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.981
I wouldn't take those odds,

31:38.030 --> 31:40.624
but you're the gambling gal,
right?

31:44.370 --> 31:45.564
Are we done?

31:45.600 --> 31:47.329
One more thing, actually.

31:47.370 --> 31:49.634
A little picture for you.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.665
Valerie Johnson.
Remember her?

31:53.710 --> 31:55.405
She was a client of yours.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.476
Indeed she was.

31:57.510 --> 31:58.545
I did her taxes for 1996.

31:58.580 --> 32:01.413
Adjusted gross,

32:01.450 --> 32:03.441
$21,380, total take-home,

32:03.480 --> 32:04.549
$25,300.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.013
She got a $408 refund.
You ever take her home, Dale?

32:09.060 --> 32:12.279
I thinkI liked you better
when you were miserable.

32:14.630 --> 32:16.257
AL:
All right.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.518
Thank you.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.219
That was Murray.

32:20.270 --> 32:23.034
She found three more cases,
same M.O.

32:23.070 --> 32:25.209
Young women strangled
with clothesline.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.708
Poughkeepsie; Binghamton;
Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

32:27.740 --> 32:29.970
Each murder corresponds
with an audit

32:30.010 --> 32:32.149
Dale Parsons attended
on behalf of clients.

32:32.180 --> 32:35.240
Valeri_e Johnson_
wasn't his only Victim.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.271
He's a serial killer.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.154
I still don't get it.
Parsons kills these women,

32:48.200 --> 32:49.622
doesn't leave a trace,

32:49.660 --> 32:51.389
but then makes up a bogus alibi,

32:51.430 --> 32:53.227
knowing Lustig could find out
and challenge him?

32:53.270 --> 32:54.669
It was seven years later.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.668
Gene was picking random days.

32:56.700 --> 32:58.236
Dale wasn't expecting
him to ask

32:58.270 --> 33:00.135
about that one day,
so he panics,

33:00.170 --> 33:01.728
and he lies.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.577
So based on IRS returns

33:05.250 --> 33:06.649
we could be up to eight victims.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.170
Oh, my God.
If he consulted,

33:08.220 --> 33:09.710
gave investment advice
to other women,

33:09.750 --> 33:10.546
who knows how many he killed?

33:10.580 --> 33:12.480
What the hell are you drinking?
Mm.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.782
Blasingame's memory juice.

33:14.820 --> 33:16.253
You know, I hate
to admit it,

33:16.290 --> 33:17.484
but I think the guy's
onto something.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.283
I read his book.
He caught a rattlesnake

33:19.330 --> 33:20.786
with his bare hands
in Death Valley.

33:20.830 --> 33:22.024
Guy's a total adrenaline junkie.

33:23.060 --> 33:24.266
LUSTIG:
You memory guys

33:24.300 --> 33:26.120
are all risk takers.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.762
Adrenaline junkies.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.030
The rush engenders...

33:30.070 --> 33:32.209
a little benign forgetting.

33:32.240 --> 33:35.107
What time of day
was Valerie Johnson murdered?

33:35.140 --> 33:36.698
It was morning sometime.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.379
She was on her way to school,
so 8:00, 8:30.

33:39.410 --> 33:41.617
We've got to bring
Dale Parsons in.

33:41.650 --> 33:43.379
We don't have enough
to arrest him.

33:43.420 --> 33:44.717
Can't lock a guy up for lying.

33:44.750 --> 33:47.344
He wasn't lying.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.625
Hey, Dale.
Hello.

33:55.660 --> 33:56.592
Thanks for coming in.

33:56.630 --> 33:59.190
Never been _in an actual
interrogation room.

33:59.230 --> 34:00.663
It's cozy.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.236
And an audience.

34:02.270 --> 34:03.498
Hello, people.

34:03.540 --> 34:05.804
So, what happens now?

34:05.840 --> 34:07.705
You break me?

34:07.740 --> 34:09.332
No.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.099
This is just a conversation,
friendly conversation, Dale.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.299
So I won't need, say, a lawyer?

34:13.350 --> 34:15.318
Why would you
need a lavwer?

34:15.350 --> 34:16.544
You're Dale Parsons.

34:16.580 --> 34:17.842
True.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.144
Okay, friendly
conversation, then.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.215
Just, let's not play
the day and date game.

34:22.260 --> 34:23.818
So does that mean
I can't ask you

34:23.860 --> 34:25.782
about July 12, 1999,

34:25.830 --> 34:27.821
August 27, 2003,

34:27.860 --> 34:29.691
October 11, 2008...

34:29.730 --> 34:31.561
Which were a Monday,
a Wednesday and a Saturday.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.862
Very nice.
Right?

34:32.900 --> 34:33.764
Yes, they were.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.336
You're good.

34:35.370 --> 34:36.735
You know what happened
on those days?

34:36.770 --> 34:39.330
You promised.

34:39.370 --> 34:40.769
Fine, why don't
I tell you

34:40.810 --> 34:41.799
what happened
on those days.

34:41.840 --> 34:45.344
July 12, 1999.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.405
Tina Davis, murdered.

34:47.450 --> 34:49.418
Strangled to death
in her car.

34:49.450 --> 34:53.318
August 27, 2003.

34:53.350 --> 34:55.887
Lakshmi Patel,
also murdered.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.559
October 11, 2008.

34:58.590 --> 34:59.727
Gloria Durning.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.829
Same M.O.

35:00.860 --> 35:03.249
All of these young
women murdered.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.892
You know any of them?

35:04.930 --> 35:05.897
You're accusing me.

35:05.930 --> 35:07.158
No.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.633
No, I'm asking you.

35:08.670 --> 35:10.399
Now I do need a lawyer.
You only need a lavwer

35:10.440 --> 35:11.737
if you've done
something wrong.

35:11.770 --> 35:14.568
Besides, you're smarter
than any lavwer I know.

35:16.780 --> 35:18.509
I don't know them.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.618
Don't remember them?

35:23.720 --> 35:24.846
Excuse me?

35:24.890 --> 35:26.539
Don't remember
killing them?

35:29.720 --> 35:30.709
You know,

35:30.760 --> 35:34.218
despite his terrible jokes,
Gene Lustig was one of

35:34.260 --> 35:35.727
the smartest men I ever met.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.365
And he said something to me
once, and it helped me a lot.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.369
He said that
people like us,

35:41.400 --> 35:43.368
sometimes we need
a vacation.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.539
You know, from all
the stuff in our heads.

35:45.570 --> 35:46.468
You more than anyone,

35:46.510 --> 35:48.375
because you were always
the best of us.

35:48.410 --> 35:49.900
You admit it.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.872
So you want to know
what the secret is?

35:55.880 --> 35:57.848
Adrenaline.

35:59.850 --> 36:01.181
We crave it.

36:01.220 --> 36:03.552
But not for the rush,
not for the high.

36:03.590 --> 36:04.727
That's for
other people.

36:04.760 --> 36:08.298
We crave_it for
the rest it gives us.

36:08.330 --> 36:10.548
From ourselves.

36:13.470 --> 36:15.563
Where were you...

36:15.600 --> 36:17.568
the morning Gene was murdered?

36:17.600 --> 36:19.864
I was at home, asleep.

36:19.910 --> 36:21.707
Okay.
What time did you wake up?

36:21.740 --> 36:22.877
6:45. It's my usual hour.

36:22.910 --> 36:24.673
It's when I take the dogs out.

36:24.710 --> 36:25.779
Oh.

36:25.810 --> 36:26.879
Anyone see you?

36:26.910 --> 36:28.946
I have no idea.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.744
Middle of a rainstorm:
odd time to walk the dogs.

36:34.790 --> 36:36.314
They don't mind the rain.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.987
Thunder must have
bothered them, no?

36:38.020 --> 36:42.252
It did, but hey,
when you got to go,

36:42.300 --> 36:43.597
you got to go.
Mm.

36:43.630 --> 36:45.928
Speaking of which,
if we're done here...

36:45.970 --> 36:48.393
There was no_ storm
the morning

36:48.440 --> 36:49.862
Gene Lustig
was murdered.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.299
No rain.

36:51.340 --> 36:52.329
No thunder.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.019
I'll lay it out for you.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.018
See, I thought you lied

37:04.050 --> 37:06.245
about the Vermeer to
cover up where you were

37:06.290 --> 37:07.587
when you killed
Valerie Johnson.

37:07.620 --> 37:08.951
But _she was murdered
in the morning.

37:08.990 --> 37:11.254
And you said you were went
to the Met in the afternoon,

37:11.290 --> 37:13.929
so I thought to
myself... why lie?

37:13.960 --> 37:17.259
Why make up an alibi
you don't need?

37:17.300 --> 37:20.929
But you weren't lying,
were you?

37:20.970 --> 37:21.959
You forgot.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.537
Because when
you murder people,

37:24.570 --> 37:27.266
like these young women,
you forget.

37:27.310 --> 37:28.277
That's why you do it.

37:28.310 --> 37:29.538
Not Gene and Alvwn.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.979
You killed them
to cover your tracks.

37:31.010 --> 37:32.978
But I bet you don't remember

37:33.010 --> 37:34.978
what happened afterwards,
do you?

37:35.020 --> 37:37.318
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:37.350 --> 37:38.487
Yes, I do.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.489
You know I do.

37:41.520 --> 37:45.650
The adrenaline unleashed
by the act of violence

37:45.690 --> 37:47.954
helps you to forget
your painful life.

37:47.990 --> 37:49.526
No, you're... you are wrong.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.959
Which becomes
more miserable

37:51.000 --> 37:52.627
when you finally,
inevitably,
No. No, that is...

37:52.670 --> 37:53.625
remember what
you've done.

37:53.670 --> 37:54.796
And then
you kill again.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.489
To forget, again.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.508
You're an addict, Dale.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.805
You're addicted to murder.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.046
You don't understand.

38:05.080 --> 38:08.049
Of course I understand.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.275
I'm the only one who does.

38:13.850 --> 38:16.717
How long do you get?

38:16.760 --> 38:18.728
A few minutes?

38:18.760 --> 38:20.079
A few hours, a whole day?

38:20.130 --> 38:21.324
How long?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.662
The first time...

38:33.710 --> 38:36.804
it was a cat.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.774
It was a stupid
neighborhood cat,

38:38.810 --> 38:40.949
and he kept howling and howling.

38:40.980 --> 38:43.949
And when I put my fingers
around its neck,

38:43.980 --> 38:47.416
and I squeezed...

38:47.450 --> 38:50.613
it was like I was here...

38:50.660 --> 38:53.982
for the first time.

38:54.030 --> 38:55.895
Just here, now.

38:55.930 --> 38:59.491
Not five minutes ago,
not 20 minutes ago,

38:59.530 --> 39:01.430
not 20 years ago,

39:01.470 --> 39:04.405
when my father did those things,

39:04.440 --> 39:07.864
and when those boys
did those things,

39:07.910 --> 39:10.037
because I was different.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.503
Because I was the one
who was always telling them

39:12.550 --> 39:15.678
that they were wrong,
because they were always wrong.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.369
They never remembered

39:17.420 --> 39:20.048
anything.

39:20.090 --> 39:23.389
And Valerie...

39:27.430 --> 39:29.819
The last thing I remember

39:29.860 --> 39:33.523
was the light
fading from her eyes

39:33.570 --> 39:37.131
like a torch down a well.

39:37.170 --> 39:40.560
And then it was a miracle.

39:40.610 --> 39:45.445
It was a whole, long,
blissful day of peace.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.071
At least I think it was.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.711
I don't remember.

39:58.590 --> 40:00.581
"Peace"?

40:04.600 --> 40:06.067
I want you

40:06.100 --> 40:09.797
to look at
these women.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.502
I want you to study
their faces.

40:15.680 --> 40:19.571
I want you... to remember them.

40:22.180 --> 40:26.446
Because from now on,
forgetting is not an option.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.730
Nice work.

40:46.770 --> 40:47.930
That was amazing.

41:09.030 --> 41:10.895
There you are.

41:10.930 --> 41:14.195
Carrie Wells, on behalf of
the Memory Studies Group,

41:14.230 --> 41:16.266
it gives me
great pleasure

41:16.300 --> 41:20.009
to present you with
this check for $100 US.

41:20.040 --> 41:22.076
Wow, Gene, $100.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.902
Along with an infinite
amount of gratitude

41:26.950 --> 41:29.612
on behalf of... me.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.686
You know, you can
grow that money,

41:31.720 --> 41:33.244
or you can just
piddle it away.

41:33.290 --> 41:35.155
Maybe I'll do both.

41:35.190 --> 41:36.214
Yeah?

41:36.260 --> 41:37.784
Let me guess.
Texas hold 'em?

41:37.820 --> 41:39.629
Blackjack, actually.

41:39.660 --> 41:40.922
Scientifically sanctioned.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.621
"A little benign forgetting."

41:42.660 --> 41:44.628
Hmm.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.069
What are you
gonna do now?

41:49.640 --> 41:51.608
Keep moving, I guess.

41:51.640 --> 41:55.974
Just a word of advice
from a new old friend?

41:57.840 --> 41:59.649
The past has
lessons for us,

41:59.680 --> 42:01.307
but the present
is where we live.

42:01.350 --> 42:04.786
And nothing brings us into
the present like a goal.

42:04.820 --> 42:07.243
A task that uses

42:07.290 --> 42:09.656
all your powers,
including...

42:12.160 --> 42:13.127
Hmm.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.991
You said you were a cop.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.165
It was too hard.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.191
Okay.

42:23.240 --> 42:26.038
But, Carrie, if anybody
ever needed a mission,

42:26.070 --> 42:27.606
it's you.

42:27.640 --> 42:30.529
When you find one,
let me know.

42:35.650 --> 42:38.619
Gene?

42:38.650 --> 42:40.789
Thank you.

42:57.140 --> 42:58.630
I'm taking off.

42:59.670 --> 43:01.979
Think I'll stick around.
