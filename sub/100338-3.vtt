WEBVTT

00:28.069 --> 00:31.197
Because on Saturday she told me that
I can't be hurt because she needs me,

00:31.281 --> 00:34.701
so not to compete on Sunday,
then I went ahead and did it.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.371
You saw that face?

00:39.372 --> 00:40.957
She look like Cruella.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.793
Yeah but punishing you

02:48.877 --> 02:52.297
to make you hurt more,
like, physically, is not reasonable.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.535
Breathe, y'all.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.660
My forearms are inflamed.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.461
Okay, but why didn't it hurt last year?

13:29.433 --> 13:31.310
I would hate you
to be my massage therapist.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.228
My routine last year
wasn't anywhere near this hard.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.639
Well, what do we do
to get a hint or help?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.953
<i>Yeah.</i> <i>Can you name the 2000 team?</i>

17:36.472 --> 17:38.599
<i>Put Lexi on the phone. Where's Lexi?</i>

17:41.185 --> 17:43.687
<i>Hey. Who was last pass 2009?</i>

17:46.356 --> 17:48.859
<i>What other years was she last pass?</i>

18:49.753 --> 18:51.213
Who's saying
they're better than somebody?

19:26.331 --> 19:28.167
I wanna ask,
when's y'all's next competition?

19:29.918 --> 19:32.379
-Bro, y'all are cold.
-Y'all like number one type shit?

20:18.425 --> 20:19.927
I feel La'Darius isn't trying.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.304
It's annoying.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.389
Can I say something please?

21:20.612 --> 21:21.989
Don't get frustrated.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.423
He not trying.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.681
Throwing up your arms and walking
away won't make the stunt work.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.443
That one hit.

25:17.807 --> 25:18.934
That's gonna be you.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.981
Boo-yah, boo-yah, boo-yah!

26:28.920 --> 26:31.381
We're trying
to piece together the whole thing.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.466
Are you on the mat right now?

33:47.316 --> 33:48.401
Are we tumbling?

33:48.609 --> 33:52.071
Y'all are tumbling because I'm off mat.
I'm still an alternate right now.

34:50.963 --> 34:54.133
Now, I'm gonna be saving
the stunts and putting 'em in the air.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.725
That's really the only opinion
I care about right now.

35:06.979 --> 35:10.024
Good.
He said he's gonna start, like, trying,

35:10.108 --> 35:12.110
and apologizing and everything.

35:12.568 --> 35:15.530
Obviously I don't want things
to have to change cause that's like--

35:16.280 --> 35:17.156
It messes up the stunt.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.745
Yeah,
we can just give it a chance.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.825
I hate school.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.270
I can tell. You got it, babe.

47:48.115 --> 47:50.075
Let me do these while I'm...

53:13.023 --> 53:14.608
Is there ice anywhere?

53:50.227 --> 53:51.061
Did it pop out?

53:51.895 --> 53:53.063
Did it pop out?

53:53.605 --> 53:57.192
It looked like it bent a way
it wasn't supposed to bend.

53:57.859 --> 53:59.819
Oh,
like hyperextended hard as fuck?

53:59.903 --> 54:03.198
Either hyperextended
or maybe even broke it. I don't know.

54:03.281 --> 54:04.449
I hope not.

54:53.415 --> 54:55.417
That may have been her last rep.

55:15.770 --> 55:19.107
Huge, huge thing
we're going to have to overcome as a team.

55:27.324 --> 55:29.159
Gabi. Get all of her stuff.
