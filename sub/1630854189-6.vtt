WEBVTT

00:02.819 --> 00:04.670
(breathing heavily)

00:04.821 --> 00:06.063
Look who I'm kissing.

00:06.232 --> 00:07.581
-(door closes)
-It's Max. Can you believe it?

00:07.733 --> 00:09.399
(moaning, breathing heavily)

00:09.418 --> 00:10.417
Wait.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.011
Are you sure you're okay
with this?

00:12.162 --> 00:13.595
Take your shirt off.

00:15.090 --> 00:18.017
I am abs-olutely okay
with this.

00:18.168 --> 00:19.259
(both chuckle)

00:20.095 --> 00:21.854
I have wanted to do this
for so long.

00:22.005 --> 00:25.107
So, first round's for speed,
second round is for distance.

00:26.009 --> 00:27.842
Third round is for creativity.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.345
Three rounds? All right.

00:30.514 --> 00:31.864
All right, buddy,
I know we're 40,

00:31.940 --> 00:34.349
but it's time to rise
to the occasion.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.425
Sex pun!

00:35.519 --> 00:37.119
-I've never been so turned on.
-Ah.

00:39.189 --> 00:40.614
You know,

00:40.766 --> 00:43.191
three generations of Silver
women have slept in this bed.

00:44.103 --> 00:46.962
I don't know why I thought
that would be hot.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.456
-Are you purring?
-(purring)

00:49.533 --> 00:53.277
(groans) Snowball,
get out of here.

00:53.295 --> 00:54.611
(yowls)

00:54.630 --> 00:55.870
(chuckles)

00:55.964 --> 00:57.556
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

00:57.783 --> 01:00.059
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

01:01.303 --> 01:05.064
<i> Oh, my gosh, Max is in my bed,</i>
<i> and we did it.</i>

01:05.215 --> 01:08.141
<i> That literally</i>
<i> cuts my bucket list in half.</i>

01:08.294 --> 01:12.145
<i> What do you know?</i>
<i> Three rounds with Kat Silver.</i>

01:12.298 --> 01:14.239
<i> Would've gotten to four</i>
<i> if that pervert cat</i>

01:14.466 --> 01:16.575
<i> wasn't licking himself</i>
<i> in the corner.</i>

01:17.486 --> 01:19.745
<i> I had an orgasm</i>
<i> with Max Kingbird,</i>

01:19.972 --> 01:21.988
<i>and he was actually here for it!</i>

01:22.750 --> 01:25.659
<i> This is weird. I'm feeling...</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:27.144
<i> What is this?</i>

01:27.162 --> 01:29.663
<i> I don't regret</i>
<i> what I did last night.</i>

01:30.424 --> 01:32.240
<i> Why isn't he saying anything?</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:35.410
<i> Does he regret this?</i>
<i> What is he thinking?</i>

01:35.429 --> 01:37.429
<i> Don't fart.</i>

01:37.581 --> 01:40.157
<i> Don't. Fart.</i>

01:40.175 --> 01:41.508
<i> Okay, be cool.</i>

01:41.602 --> 01:44.269
<i> Just roll over</i>
<i> and say good morning.</i>

01:44.421 --> 01:47.514
<i> It's only Max.</i>
<i> Your friend Max.</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:50.867
<i> Who spun you like a dreidel</i>
<i> in Nana Silver's bed.</i>

01:50.869 --> 01:55.021
<i> All right, I think I can</i>
<i> hide this on the rollover.</i>

01:55.116 --> 01:56.840
<i> On three.</i>

01:56.859 --> 01:59.618
<i> One, two, three.</i>

01:59.769 --> 02:02.454
-Ow!
-Ow, ow. (sputters)

02:02.606 --> 02:04.197
-You okay?
-Yep.

02:04.350 --> 02:05.532
(Max groans)

02:05.684 --> 02:07.960
Here, let me fan you
with these sheets a little.

02:12.691 --> 02:14.040
So...

02:14.135 --> 02:15.467
last night was fun,

02:15.694 --> 02:19.638
but also stuff that
friends don't normally do.

02:19.865 --> 02:22.099
Yeah. (laughs)

02:23.035 --> 02:24.534
Yeah.

02:24.553 --> 02:28.981
Are we friends who just had
a crazy night, or...

02:29.057 --> 02:31.600
or are we...?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.377
Yeah.

02:33.395 --> 02:35.028
Are we...?

02:36.640 --> 02:38.806
<i> That's right, Max. I may have</i>
<i> cut off a lock of your hair</i>

02:38.884 --> 02:40.384
<i> while you were sleeping,</i>

02:40.402 --> 02:42.578
<i> but I will not ask you</i>
<i> to be my boyfriend.</i>

02:43.405 --> 02:44.997
Honestly...

02:46.167 --> 02:48.983
I'd like to see
if there's something here.

02:49.077 --> 02:51.336
I mean,
if-if that's what you want.

02:51.488 --> 02:53.747
It worked!
We're gonna do this!

02:53.899 --> 02:55.716
It's happening,
it's happening!

02:57.178 --> 02:59.011
Yeah, we can give it a shot.

02:59.238 --> 03:01.180
(Kat chuckles)

03:03.166 --> 03:06.593
You know,
Papa Silver died in this bed.

03:07.579 --> 03:09.079
Maybe you should just kiss me
so I shut up.

03:09.097 --> 03:11.106
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:12.784 --> 03:14.026
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:14.253 --> 03:15.510
Wait, why are you so sweaty?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.771
Did somebody finally teach you
how to Dougie?

03:17.923 --> 03:19.847
I was training my son.
He's going out for track.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.868
I mean, it's not football,
but at least it's not band.

03:23.019 --> 03:24.261
Oh, well, I can work with CJ.

03:24.354 --> 03:25.687
I used to run the 100 meters.

03:25.764 --> 03:26.872
I was the fastest girl
in my school.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.124
So was I.

03:29.859 --> 03:31.043
I appreciate the offer,

03:31.270 --> 03:34.104
but, you know,
men run different than women.

03:34.122 --> 03:37.716
I see,
and "different" meaning faster?

03:37.867 --> 03:39.960
Oh, good, you know.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.295
So, you think that
you can beat me in a race

03:42.448 --> 03:44.281
just because you have a penis?

03:44.299 --> 03:45.707
Well, I'm not a scientist,

03:45.726 --> 03:48.802
so I don't know
where the speed is stored,

03:48.954 --> 03:50.211
but yes.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.788
You know what?
That's it.

03:51.807 --> 03:53.381
After work,
we are gonna race.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.808
Put some lotion
on those ashy knees

03:54.960 --> 03:56.050
and meet me in the park

03:56.144 --> 03:57.978
for a good
old-fashioned ass-kicking.

03:58.130 --> 03:59.312
Oh, you're on.

03:59.465 --> 04:00.722
And there won't be
any ass-kicking,

04:00.741 --> 04:02.299
only ass-gazing.

04:02.392 --> 04:07.246
As in, your eyes watching my ass
leave your ass behind.

04:08.565 --> 04:09.581
Hey, everybody.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.333
Oh, my God, you've had sex.

04:12.327 --> 04:13.643
What are you talking about?

04:13.662 --> 04:16.255
Ugh, been so long,
she doesn't remember what it is.

04:16.331 --> 04:18.815
(singsongy):
Knowing when people had sex
is my superpower.

04:18.834 --> 04:19.925
Yeah, it's true.

04:20.076 --> 04:22.577
When she met my parents,
she called them out.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.746
Made church so awkward.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.657
Hold up, you've had sex
with Max.

04:27.751 --> 04:29.159
-(gasps)
-Max?

04:29.177 --> 04:31.011
Did my name come up?

04:31.163 --> 04:33.421
What happened between me and Max
is private.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.608
We did it three times
last night.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.535
Let's get this baby cooking.

04:38.562 --> 04:40.428
Go lie down
and put your feet in the air.

04:40.522 --> 04:41.613
You need to marinate.

04:41.765 --> 04:43.356
You know, like you do
with an old chicken.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.342
We're putting the baby
on the backburner--

04:45.360 --> 04:47.119
unfortunate choice of words.

04:47.270 --> 04:49.513
We just want to focus
on seeing where this goes.

04:49.606 --> 04:51.531
We have our first real date
tonight!

04:51.683 --> 04:54.609
Great, we're gonna gamble
my grandchild's existence

04:54.628 --> 04:56.611
on your personality.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.255
I need a drink.

05:02.861 --> 05:05.053
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

05:06.381 --> 05:07.364
Oh.

05:07.382 --> 05:08.307
(chuckles):
Oh, we're gonna sit

05:08.534 --> 05:09.866
on the same side
of the booth.

05:09.959 --> 05:12.060
That's the other
half of my bucket list.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.204
Hello, I'm Greg.

05:14.222 --> 05:16.297
Is this your first time
dining with us?

05:16.317 --> 05:19.318
It's actually our first time
dining anywhere as a couple.

05:19.545 --> 05:21.878
We have been best friends
forever,

05:21.897 --> 05:24.305
no benefits, just really strong
feelings for each other.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.565
We're kind of
like Cagney and Lacey,

05:25.659 --> 05:28.160
but we don't solve crimes
and he's not a lady.

05:28.387 --> 05:31.221
He was in a relationship,
and I was in a relationship.

05:31.239 --> 05:32.998
And then last night, Greg,
out of the blue,

05:33.149 --> 05:36.376
boom, bang,
Bonetown, population two.

05:37.412 --> 05:40.172
We did it three times,
and I'm 40.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.759
I'll get you some bread.

05:45.829 --> 05:48.071
He's not coming back, is he?

05:48.164 --> 05:50.057
(both chuckle)

05:50.909 --> 05:52.092
Why are you staring at me?

05:52.244 --> 05:54.186
-Oh, no, do I have a bat
in the cave?
-What?

05:54.337 --> 05:55.520
No.

05:55.747 --> 05:58.148
You just, you look great.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.767
Thank you.

06:00.919 --> 06:01.843
Is that a new outfit?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.770
Oh, no.
I-I've had it forever.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.256
Uh, fire sale.
An estate sale.

06:06.274 --> 06:07.991
She died in a fire.

06:11.187 --> 06:12.537
You look really nice.

06:12.764 --> 06:14.873
Thanks. Shaved the ears.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.627
Yeah, that was supposed to be
in my head.

06:27.279 --> 06:29.638
(chuckles nervously)

06:32.968 --> 06:35.452
-This is weird. Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah, I'm gonna sit
on that side. Yeah.

06:35.621 --> 06:37.229
-Okay.
-Yeah.

06:37.422 --> 06:38.880
Yeah, this is much better.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.715
You know, now I got
a little elbow room.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.127
Like the settlers moving west,
taking land from the natives.

06:44.296 --> 06:45.404
Why would I go there? I...

06:45.480 --> 06:47.406
You know what,
we both just need to relax.

06:47.482 --> 06:49.056
Let's just,
let's start this thing over.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.635
That's a great idea.
That's a really great idea.

06:52.395 --> 06:55.247
Whoa. What the hell?! Is there
something under the table?

06:55.474 --> 06:57.565
That was my foot.
I was playing footsie.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.752
(sighs)
I have a very specific phobia

07:00.904 --> 07:04.739
about alligators attacking
my feet under restaurant tables.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.167
That has literally
never happened.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.503
Uh, I saw it on<i> Gator 911.</i>

07:10.656 --> 07:12.079
That poor bride.

07:12.174 --> 07:13.657
Well, this is no gator.

07:13.750 --> 07:16.601
It's a size 12 foot
in a sock from Men's Wearhouse.

07:16.828 --> 07:19.438
(laughs):
That's nice.

07:19.589 --> 07:21.606
Five-toe fandango.

07:21.758 --> 07:23.257
Whoa, gator!

07:23.426 --> 07:24.609
Your other foot.

07:31.860 --> 07:36.455
All right, this is gonna be
a Harlan County two-scamper.

07:36.682 --> 07:41.501
No skipsies, no jumpsies,
no shooty-backsies.

07:42.370 --> 07:44.111
So, you scared?

07:44.189 --> 07:45.780
Scared? Please.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.114
I'm only scared
of three things--

07:47.134 --> 07:51.118
horror films, snakes
and very low ceiling fans.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.529
Yeah, big talk, old man.

07:52.664 --> 07:54.789
Did you get a biscuit
with those chicken legs?

07:54.808 --> 07:58.643
Yeah, well, these chicken legs
got 11 herbs and spices,

07:58.795 --> 08:01.980
which that makes them extra
crispy, so that means that...

08:02.131 --> 08:04.357
You know what?
Let's just do this.

08:09.639 --> 08:11.138
Okay.

08:11.233 --> 08:14.493
Ready, set, scamper!

08:14.720 --> 08:16.995
♪ ♪

08:38.593 --> 08:41.077
(whoops) You see that?

08:41.096 --> 08:42.687
It's the running man.

08:42.839 --> 08:45.749
Ooh, and now, oh,
it's the running Carter.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.192
-(whimpering)
-(Carter stammers)

08:47.419 --> 08:48.527
-You tripped me!
-(laughs)

08:48.754 --> 08:52.531
Ain't nobody tripping out here
but you, loser.

08:52.682 --> 08:53.773
(high-pitched):
Loser.

08:53.942 --> 08:56.034
-Loser.
-Phil, you saw, she cheated!

08:56.185 --> 08:57.702
What? I'm sorry.

08:57.854 --> 09:02.098
I just realized I'm wearing
two different color shoes.

09:02.117 --> 09:04.626
(laughing)

09:08.123 --> 09:10.131
How's your lamb?

09:11.552 --> 09:13.093
Good.

09:14.112 --> 09:15.445
How's your pasta?

09:15.463 --> 09:17.097
Good.

09:17.799 --> 09:18.965
<i> This lamb is terrible.</i>

09:19.117 --> 09:20.392
<i> Why didn't I tell her that?</i>

09:20.543 --> 09:23.669
<i> I could've said,</i>
<i> "Pretty baaad."</i>

09:23.822 --> 09:26.213
<i> I just wanted</i>
<i> this night to be special.</i>

09:26.233 --> 09:28.215
<i>I shaved every inch of my body.</i>

09:28.310 --> 09:30.143
<i> I'm like a fricking dolphin.</i>

09:30.295 --> 09:34.072
<i> Why can't I think of</i>
<i>something funny or cool to say?</i>

09:34.299 --> 09:35.481
<i> Wait, I got it.</i>

09:36.318 --> 09:40.620
Is it just me or is
the service here pretty baaad?

09:41.564 --> 09:43.306
What?

09:44.251 --> 09:45.733
I don't know
what's wrong with me, I'm sorry.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.978
-Me, too.
Why is this so awkward?
-(laughs): I don't know.

09:48.997 --> 09:50.313
We're usually so comfortable
together.

09:50.332 --> 09:51.906
Like this morning,
I heard you fart.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.484
What? No. No.
It was, it was your bed.

09:54.502 --> 09:56.486
You said so yourself,
it's very old.

09:56.579 --> 09:59.431
(sighs)
We had so much fun last night.

09:59.624 --> 10:00.506
And again this morning.

10:00.659 --> 10:02.342
I want this
to be more like that.

10:02.494 --> 10:06.771
You know, we could wash away
this whole night in my shower.

10:06.998 --> 10:08.665
That's a slip-and-fall risk.

10:08.683 --> 10:10.108
Safety first, sexy second.

10:10.927 --> 10:14.195
Don't worry, 'cause my shower
has grippy ducks on the floor.

10:15.190 --> 10:18.325
Recommended by the AARP.

10:19.527 --> 10:21.435
Really?

10:21.529 --> 10:26.032
Well, those grippy ducks are
about to swim with a dolphin.

10:26.109 --> 10:28.609
I don't get that,

10:28.629 --> 10:30.945
but quack, quack, quack.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.298
-(imitating dolphin)
-(quacking)

10:36.711 --> 10:38.878
Ooh, a candle.

10:39.030 --> 10:40.864
I didn't realize Bonetown had

10:40.882 --> 10:42.790
a Spiced Pumpkin district.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.367
We're close to shopping

10:44.386 --> 10:46.460
and the schools are excellent.

10:46.554 --> 10:47.871
Are they?

10:47.964 --> 10:50.056
Maybe you're a teacher

10:50.208 --> 10:51.391
and I'm the new student.

10:51.543 --> 10:52.925
Yeah.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.378
And you're in trouble because
you didn't do your homework.

10:55.397 --> 10:57.638
Why wouldn't I do my homework?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.716
I'm all for role-play

10:59.734 --> 11:01.809
but, like, it has to make sense.

11:01.903 --> 11:03.995
Okay, all right, so...

11:04.147 --> 11:06.572
what would you want
to get in trouble for?

11:06.725 --> 11:08.149
I don't want to get
in trouble for anything.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.334
I'm new to this school,

11:09.503 --> 11:11.211
I'm trying to make
a good impression.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.506
Maybe let's work up
to role-play.

11:14.733 --> 11:15.915
Oh, um...

11:16.009 --> 11:17.750
-I could be a foreign
exchange student.
-Oh.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.512
(Irish accent): Good day
to ya, Professor Kingbird.

11:20.588 --> 11:23.640
Do you want to see
where I hid me pot o' gold?

11:24.500 --> 11:26.242
I'm not gonna lie.

11:26.261 --> 11:28.019
I don't hate that.

11:30.006 --> 11:31.247
<i> KAT:</i>
<i> Oh, no, I am wearing</i>

11:31.340 --> 11:33.024
<i> some weapons-grade</i>
<i> shapewear right now.</i>

11:33.251 --> 11:35.251
<i> He doesn't need to see</i>
<i> how this sausage is cased.</i>

11:35.270 --> 11:37.195
Uh, actually, I'm gonna run

11:37.346 --> 11:38.771
to the bathroom real quick.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.347
(Irish accent):
When you come back,

11:40.367 --> 11:42.534
you can kiss me Blarney Stone.

11:43.261 --> 11:45.578
Damn, you're sexy.

11:47.523 --> 11:49.949
(panting)

11:50.101 --> 11:52.210
(grunting)

11:54.105 --> 11:56.122
This is like prom
all over again.

11:56.274 --> 11:58.975
You know, if I went to prom.

11:58.977 --> 12:01.177
(grunting)

12:04.950 --> 12:06.950
-Ow!
-MAX: You okay?

12:07.043 --> 12:09.285
Yeah, yeah,
just getting ready to pee!

12:09.378 --> 12:12.731
Oh, oh, I don't want him
to hear this mighty tinkle.

12:15.384 --> 12:16.383
MAX:
Are you taking a shower?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.052
Yeah, just gonna take
a quick rinse.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.738
(Irish accent):
Ooh, you've got Irish Spring!

12:19.965 --> 12:21.631
It's the body wash of me people.

12:21.649 --> 12:23.557
MAX: I'm gonna get us
a bottle of wine.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.577
Yeah, and I'm gonna make room
for that wine.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.537
(mouthing)

12:28.564 --> 12:31.040
(exclaims, grunts)

12:34.829 --> 12:37.130
Hard to believe
I didn't go to prom.

12:48.676 --> 12:50.084
What do we think?

12:50.178 --> 12:51.344
Does this pose say

12:51.496 --> 12:53.521
"my butt's never been dunked
in toilet water"?

12:54.682 --> 12:56.257
What is taking him so long?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.501
-Oh! (laughing)
-Ooh! (laughing)

12:58.594 --> 13:00.353
I don't understand cricket,
but I do understand

13:00.505 --> 13:02.171
a guy getting hit in the nuts.

13:02.190 --> 13:03.615
Hey, balls hitting balls.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.200
It's poetic.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.012
Hey, uh, what's going on?

13:09.030 --> 13:10.622
Oh, you've got to see
these bloopers.

13:10.773 --> 13:13.016
The Phillie Phanatic's about
to take a fastball to the nuts.

13:13.018 --> 13:14.700
They're all pretty much about

13:14.795 --> 13:16.853
guys taking one to the nuts.

13:16.855 --> 13:19.964
Uh, what happened
to getting us wine?

13:20.116 --> 13:22.342
Oh, right.

13:23.378 --> 13:24.861
Hey!

13:24.954 --> 13:27.363
You know what, uh, just keep it.

13:27.382 --> 13:28.973
I'll be hanging out
in your bedroom,

13:29.125 --> 13:30.141
and if you'd rather watch

13:30.385 --> 13:32.035
guys get hit in the testicles
with your buddy,

13:32.128 --> 13:34.387
that's, it's fine,
that's fine by me.

13:35.223 --> 13:38.299
Bruh, you have
the coolest girlfriend.

13:38.393 --> 13:40.360
(sighs)

13:41.988 --> 13:44.380
Hey. I shouldn't
have kept you waiting.

13:44.473 --> 13:46.732
Carter was upset
about his fight with Randi.

13:46.885 --> 13:48.976
(chuckles) He, he was
even crying a little.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.887
CARTER:
The hell I was!

13:50.980 --> 13:53.406
You know, I-I think
I just want to go home.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.982
What? No, no.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.393
-We can turn this around.
-Can we?

13:57.412 --> 13:59.896
I mean, this night has been off
from the beginning.

13:59.914 --> 14:02.323
And it's not just the-the wine

14:02.417 --> 14:04.233
or the TV or the freak hurricane

14:04.327 --> 14:05.568
that hit your bathroom.

14:05.661 --> 14:06.845
Wait, what?

14:07.072 --> 14:08.921
Climate change.

14:09.090 --> 14:10.682
It's fine.

14:10.909 --> 14:13.259
I just, I'll talk to you later.

14:13.411 --> 14:15.353
Okay.

14:15.504 --> 14:17.580
Okay. Bye.

14:17.599 --> 14:19.983
(door closes)

14:23.512 --> 14:26.072
What the hell?!

14:27.092 --> 14:28.274
(singsongy):
I've got something

14:28.426 --> 14:30.184
to show you.

14:30.278 --> 14:32.871
I get it, your mole looks
like Winnie the Pooh.

14:33.098 --> 14:34.205
Go see a doctor.

14:34.432 --> 14:36.933
I got a video
of your race with Randi.

14:36.951 --> 14:38.042
Really?

14:38.194 --> 14:39.711
How'd you get it?

14:39.787 --> 14:41.104
Security cam.

14:41.272 --> 14:42.714
Let's just say my dalliance

14:42.865 --> 14:44.607
with a certain deputy mayor

14:44.700 --> 14:46.609
finally paid off.

14:47.779 --> 14:50.388
<i> Hey, y'all. I'm so excited</i>
<i> to be auditioning</i>

14:50.615 --> 14:53.391
<i>for</i> So You Think You Can Dance.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.877
<i> 'Cause I think I can.</i>

14:56.897 --> 14:58.638
No, no, that's the wrong file.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.149
I see.
(chuckles)

15:02.068 --> 15:04.477
Okay, here we go.

15:04.629 --> 15:06.145
I'm winning.

15:06.297 --> 15:07.813
Here's where we're close.

15:07.966 --> 15:10.158
Let's slow it down.

15:14.656 --> 15:15.930
She never touched me.

15:15.932 --> 15:18.583
She was pulling ahead
when you fell.

15:18.734 --> 15:20.418
She spanked you.

15:21.312 --> 15:24.672
Just like I spanked
that deputy mayor.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.926
Well...

15:28.153 --> 15:30.411
I know what I got to do.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.821
My audition!

15:31.914 --> 15:33.339
What do you want me to do, Phil?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.725
Tell my girlfriend the truth?

15:38.513 --> 15:39.604
Hey.

15:39.831 --> 15:41.180
How was your night with Max?

15:41.332 --> 15:42.665
Randi, do your thing.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.442
They didn't have sex.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.110
You know, I don't
appreciate people talking

15:46.337 --> 15:48.004
about how I didn't have sex.

15:48.097 --> 15:49.614
It's like high school
all over again.

15:49.841 --> 15:51.691
And college.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.618
And my 30s.

15:53.845 --> 15:55.528
What happened, sweetheart?

15:55.622 --> 15:56.862
I don't know.

15:57.015 --> 15:59.031
We went out
for a romantic dinner.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.533
It was super awkward.

16:00.609 --> 16:02.201
I thought I got attacked
by a gator.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.538
I fell in his toilet
and my Spanx are in an oak tree.

16:05.690 --> 16:07.281
Carter thought
that was a beige raccoon.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.126
He was so excited thinking
he discovered a new species.

16:10.953 --> 16:12.286
This was only our first date.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.880
What if it never gets better
and Max and I were stupid

16:15.033 --> 16:16.549
to think we could ever
be a couple?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.367
Maybe this whole thing was
a huge mistake.

16:18.461 --> 16:20.052
Let's keep
some perspective here.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.129
Those glasses were
a huge mistake.

16:22.223 --> 16:25.966
It's not romantic dinners
that will get you

16:26.060 --> 16:27.301
through a lifetime together.

16:27.395 --> 16:30.488
It's the fact that you two
are such good friends.

16:30.639 --> 16:33.140
That's the foundation
for everything.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.326
Look at your father and me.

16:35.553 --> 16:37.845
Dad did always say
you were his best friend.

16:37.847 --> 16:40.164
I assumed it was
a hostage situation.

16:40.316 --> 16:42.391
We loved being together.

16:42.485 --> 16:43.817
We made each other laugh.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.653
Although we did tie each other
up from time to time.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.731
-Oh!
-Okay! You are a freak.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.417
We can have a talk when
the children leave the room.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.344
Yeah, thank you,
you've been very helpful.

16:53.496 --> 16:55.087
You've given me
a lot to think about,

16:55.240 --> 16:57.757
and one disturbing thing
to try and forget.

16:57.925 --> 17:00.409
We used Kat's jump rope.

17:00.411 --> 17:02.562
Two things!

17:04.766 --> 17:06.507
-Hey.
-Hey, what's that?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.583
They're running shoes.

17:07.602 --> 17:09.527
I got them for CJ
for his tryouts.

17:09.754 --> 17:11.604
Oh, really? Aw, thank you.

17:11.756 --> 17:13.031
Ooh, and they're spiked.

17:13.258 --> 17:15.682
Fast around the track,
hard on my ex-wife's floors.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.260
Win-win.

17:17.428 --> 17:19.704
Yeah, I didn't know if you would
have time to buy them yourself,

17:19.781 --> 17:22.022
you know,
given how slow you are.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.267
Look, there's no way for us
to know for sure

17:24.360 --> 17:25.451
what happened in that race.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.713
So let's just blame Phil
and move on.

17:28.864 --> 17:32.199
Fine, but can you do me a favor?

17:33.035 --> 17:34.868
Don't tell CJ
that boys are faster than girls.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.388
Because that's how the guys
treated me on the track team,

17:37.540 --> 17:38.948
and it sucked.

17:38.966 --> 17:40.892
All right.

17:41.119 --> 17:42.226
I'll see you.

17:42.378 --> 17:43.877
Hold up.

17:43.897 --> 17:44.970
Yeah?

17:45.065 --> 17:48.140
Uh, I saw security footage
of our race,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.643
and you didn't trip me.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.053
Ha! I knew it. I beat your ass.

17:53.147 --> 17:55.389
Piano man,
play "We Are the Champions."

17:55.525 --> 17:58.242
Not if you want
to get paid, Lawrence.

17:58.394 --> 17:59.485
Listen.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.138
There's something else
I want to tell you.

18:02.231 --> 18:04.640
I think you should train CJ.

18:04.733 --> 18:05.658
Really?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.752
Yeah, you ran track.

18:07.937 --> 18:09.478
You'd be a better coach.

18:09.572 --> 18:12.590
And it's hard for me
to teach what's God-given.

18:12.817 --> 18:14.926
-Well, thank you.
-Yeah.

18:15.153 --> 18:16.427
You think it'll be okay
even though

18:16.579 --> 18:18.504
I don't have
a penis full of speed?

18:18.656 --> 18:20.156
Yeah, that was stupid.

18:20.174 --> 18:23.184
Clearly you've got
a lot of it in your boobs.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.760
Hey, I got your text.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.854
Everything all right?

18:34.930 --> 18:37.356
Yeah, I just wanted to see you.

18:37.525 --> 18:39.117
Oh, okay.

18:39.344 --> 18:40.601
You said "important,"

18:40.695 --> 18:42.787
so I thought you got locked
on the roof again.

18:42.938 --> 18:44.271
(laughs)

18:44.440 --> 18:45.623
So what's up?

18:45.700 --> 18:47.683
Okay, well, um...

18:47.685 --> 18:49.352
I've been thinking.

18:49.370 --> 18:51.295
What's, like,
your favorite moment

18:51.372 --> 18:52.688
we've ever spent together?

18:52.707 --> 18:53.873
Oh, that's easy.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.191
The first time
we ever sang together.

18:55.209 --> 18:57.468
"Time of My Life"
from<i> Dirty Dancing?</i>

18:57.620 --> 19:00.120
Yeah, karaoke contest
at Warblers.

19:00.214 --> 19:01.881
We came in second
to those frat boys

19:02.033 --> 19:03.382
doing "Bohemian Rhapsody."

19:03.534 --> 19:05.459
They didn't even know
who Galileo was.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.562
Yeah, idiots.

19:10.633 --> 19:13.651
So... what's yours?

19:15.062 --> 19:17.137
Sophomore year,
the night we finished finals.

19:17.231 --> 19:19.490
-Aw.
-We took a blanket to the park.

19:19.642 --> 19:21.717
We had pizza and beer.

19:21.736 --> 19:23.744
We're all growed up now.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.374
And we made wishes
on a shooting star.

19:29.410 --> 19:30.817
Mine...

19:30.912 --> 19:33.062
was that
that night would never end.

19:33.155 --> 19:34.914
That's so sweet.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.492
Mine was that Rob Schneider
would make<i> The Hot Chick 2.</i>

19:38.511 --> 19:41.070
(both laugh)

19:42.015 --> 19:45.016
Max, I don't want
to lose moments like that.

19:45.167 --> 19:47.743
Like this.

19:47.762 --> 19:49.762
What? Why would we?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.672
Because if this dating thing
doesn't work out,

19:51.766 --> 19:54.233
it's gonna be weird.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.030
So...

20:00.033 --> 20:02.700
So you're saying that
you don't want to do this?

20:02.851 --> 20:04.443
It's not worth it if it means

20:04.595 --> 20:07.038
we're never gonna be
Kat and Max again.

20:07.765 --> 20:10.041
(exhales)

20:12.528 --> 20:14.212
I get why you're afraid.

20:14.439 --> 20:15.604
I am, too.

20:15.698 --> 20:17.440
But...

20:17.458 --> 20:20.626
I think that we have
a chance at something

20:20.720 --> 20:22.970
really special.

20:24.632 --> 20:26.224
So do I.

20:26.451 --> 20:27.950
And I can't promise

20:27.969 --> 20:30.010
that this is gonna work out,

20:30.121 --> 20:32.621
but I can promise

20:32.640 --> 20:35.942
that you are never gonna
lose me as a friend.

20:36.794 --> 20:38.885
How can you promise that?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.054
Kat.

20:41.966 --> 20:44.033
You couldn't lose me
if you tried.

20:52.568 --> 20:54.252
Should we go inside?

20:54.479 --> 20:55.978
Or should we stay right here?

20:56.071 --> 20:57.904
I don't think
anybody can see us.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.591
(whispers):
He doesn't know about you.
