01:03.300 --> 01:06.113
BURUNDI IS A COUNTRY IN CENTRAL AFRICA,
BORDERED BY

01:06.233 --> 01:09.800
RWANDA, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO,
AND TANZANIA.

01:09.940 --> 01:12.752
ITS CAPITAL CITY IS BUJUMBURA.

01:12.881 --> 01:16.112
IN 1992, WHEN THIS STORY BEGINS,

01:16.228 --> 01:19.013
ITS POPULATION WAS 5.6 MILLION.

01:19.135 --> 01:22.674
AS IN RWANDA,
THERE WERE TWO MAJOR ETHNIC GROUPS:

01:22.832 --> 01:27.059
THE HUTU MAJORITY,
AND THE TUTSI.

01:52.650 --> 01:56.867
SMALL COUNTRY

01:57.889 --> 02:00.888
BUJUMBURA, BURUNDI
1992

02:01.405 --> 02:03.405
Hey, you little pests!

02:03.939 --> 02:06.247
Get out of my garden!

02:06.420 --> 02:09.542
Go away!
Quick, darling, release the dogs!

02:09.787 --> 02:14.176
Now I'll show you! How dare you!

02:16.634 --> 02:19.467
Mangoes, mangoes, mangoes, mangoes!

02:21.342 --> 02:22.643
Madam, don't you
want a mango?

02:24.254 --> 02:26.055
Mango, <i>monsieur</i>?

02:26.563 --> 02:29.004
Mangoes!
Mangoes!

02:29.502 --> 02:30.860
Boy, get out of here!

02:30.942 --> 02:32.942
<i>Monsieur,</i> mango!

02:33.862 --> 02:36.324
- Mango?
- Ah... Gabriel!

02:36.366 --> 02:39.992
Where did you find these
wonderful mangoes?

02:40.318 --> 02:42.125
We picked them.

02:42.332 --> 02:44.165
- You picked them?
- Yes.

02:44.930 --> 02:48.799
Okay... I'll take one.
How much does it cost?

02:49.025 --> 02:51.473
- 200 francs.
- 200 francs?

02:51.660 --> 02:54.091
Are they made of pure gold?

03:25.285 --> 03:28.376
200 francs for a mango?
Gaby, you're amazing!

03:28.417 --> 03:32.254
- The teacher must have been shocked.
- It will be a lesson to her.

04:04.446 --> 04:07.394
- Hello, boss.
- Hello, Calixte.

04:11.365 --> 04:13.365
Hello, hello.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.263
- Hello, Prothé.
- Hello, Gaby.

04:26.376 --> 04:27.910
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

04:28.010 --> 04:30.199
- Normal.
- What do you want me to make for you?

04:30.350 --> 04:34.686
- Crepes, please.
- Crepes... I will make them right away.

04:53.145 --> 04:56.373
- Prothé, you're not sick anymore?
- No, I'm not sick anymore.

04:56.493 --> 05:00.081
- I feel much better. And how are you?
- Okay.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.527
What do you want
me to make for you?

05:02.774 --> 05:04.704
- Crepes.
- Okay.

05:23.804 --> 05:26.451
- How's school going?
- Normal.

05:27.932 --> 05:32.132
- Our teacher is very good.
- Really?

05:32.867 --> 05:35.926
I like mathematics,
but it's hard.

05:36.026 --> 05:39.917
It's nothing, learn more
and you will manage.

05:54.693 --> 05:56.486
- How are things here?
- Father.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.161
- Did you sleep well? And you?
- Normal.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.039
- Prothé, your condition seems to have improved.
- Yes, much better.

06:02.119 --> 06:03.781
My family thanks you.

06:04.231 --> 06:08.818
Do not thank me.
They will deduct it from your salary.

06:09.217 --> 06:11.217
Yes, hello?

06:13.743 --> 06:15.698
Are you kidding me?

06:15.904 --> 06:20.261
So... if they pay me by Friday,
the work will be done. So give it to them.

06:20.401 --> 06:21.590
Calixte,

06:22.047 --> 06:24.893
feed the dog
and leave the gate open.

06:24.986 --> 06:27.734
- Okay, boss.
- Okay, kids. It's time to go!

06:27.834 --> 06:31.857
Hello, darlings.
Did you hear what Dad said?

06:32.089 --> 06:34.520
Come on, hurry up, please.
Come on.

06:44.578 --> 06:47.475
- <i>Salam aleikum,</i> Donatien.
- Hello, Calixte.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.708
That's how I got this job.

06:55.935 --> 06:59.290
We don't have to
choose a lot, right?

06:59.489 --> 07:01.088
Give me your credentials.

07:01.956 --> 07:05.875
Give them here.
Donatien, borrow it.

07:06.146 --> 07:07.381
Hello.

07:07.655 --> 07:10.556
Hello, boss.
Here come the reinforcements.

07:10.598 --> 07:11.988
Let's go!

07:12.067 --> 07:14.758
- We have to go through the construction site.
- Again? But, Dad,

07:14.845 --> 07:17.798
I'm always late for school
when we stop there!

07:17.905 --> 07:19.690
Don't worry.
Gaby!

07:26.476 --> 07:30.242
Ana, wait, your bag!
I gotta run!

07:30.283 --> 07:32.087
Six, seven...

07:32.510 --> 07:33.861
eight...

07:33.978 --> 07:35.718
and nine.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.666
I see you, Gabriel Shapaz.

07:37.746 --> 07:40.374
Sorry, my dad had to stop
at the construction site.

07:40.481 --> 07:43.963
You always have the same excuse.
As I was saying...

07:44.005 --> 07:47.332
- "The Bus Gang"! That's good.
- But they won't understand.

07:47.464 --> 07:51.784
"NW Gang" is better.
It will sound great in English.

07:51.924 --> 07:55.396
Also, "the Volkswagen Gang".
Not bad.

07:55.509 --> 07:58.269
- This is also an option.
- Chloe, thank you, sit down.

07:58.388 --> 08:00.644
You must have something interesting.

08:00.764 --> 08:02.672
Gabriel, get up.
Gino, the note.

08:02.766 --> 08:04.370
Give it to me!

08:05.130 --> 08:09.490
"The three musketeers, eternal friends.
Together forever..."

08:09.531 --> 08:12.273
"The Bus Gang",
"Gang NW".

08:12.386 --> 08:14.493
True poetry.

08:14.611 --> 08:17.650
Gino, get up.
Armand, Lucien and Paul, too.

08:17.905 --> 08:20.459
It's actually a gang of five.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.419
Five donkeys, madam!

08:23.839 --> 08:28.287
Gabriel, why isn't "The Three Musketeers"
suitable as a name for your gang?

08:31.606 --> 08:32.994
Don't you know?

08:33.127 --> 08:35.808
You roar like a donkey.
You don't know?

08:35.849 --> 08:36.954
Does anybody know?

08:37.054 --> 08:39.788
There are five of them,
but there were four musketeers.

08:39.902 --> 08:42.581
Correct.
Well done, Felicite.

08:43.771 --> 08:46.712
The gang of five,
you stay.

08:46.839 --> 08:50.155
And you will repeat the poem.
The others can go out.

08:54.699 --> 08:57.952
- Hello, children.
- Hello, Mom.

08:58.072 --> 09:00.598
- How was your day?
- Alright.

09:01.377 --> 09:03.085
- What about you? Alright?
- Yes.

09:03.839 --> 09:06.336
- Will you have dinner?
- I ate already.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.109
With Gertrude?

09:08.350 --> 09:11.396
- Prothé, will you cut me a lemon?
- Right away.

09:18.248 --> 09:20.248
Hello, Gertrude.

09:21.184 --> 09:23.297
- I didn't tell you, but...
- Are you done, <i>monsieur</i>?

09:23.391 --> 09:25.945
After clearing the table,
you can go home.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.506
- Will you drink coffee?
- We went to the club.

09:30.045 --> 09:31.626
No!

09:32.324 --> 09:34.797
- "Black and White", and you?
- Mom?

09:34.940 --> 09:36.175
- Mom?
- What?

09:36.260 --> 09:40.174
- Will you eat dessert with us?
- Yes, yes, I'm coming, dear.

09:40.810 --> 09:42.194
Really?

09:43.484 --> 09:44.839
Why?

09:45.560 --> 09:47.031
Stop it.

09:48.985 --> 09:50.985
Yes, yes...

09:51.209 --> 09:53.427
<i>How much to offer to meet him?</i>

09:53.468 --> 09:55.708
I don't know how much.

09:57.265 --> 10:00.786
- Go take a shower and go to bed.
- Okay.

10:00.978 --> 10:03.440
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.969
Wait, wait.
I have to kiss the children goodnight.

10:08.142 --> 10:10.521
- Goodnight, Mom.
- Goodnight, my dear.

10:10.898 --> 10:13.584
- Goodnight, Mom.
- Goodnight.

10:13.883 --> 10:16.366
- Don't forget to pray.
- Of course.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.895
BUKAVU, ZAIRE

11:01.995 --> 11:05.499
He lived in Africa a long time ago.
Do you see the two elephants there?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.514
They were engraved by a magician.

11:08.074 --> 11:10.786
Wizard! Can you imagine?

11:11.259 --> 11:14.299
- How are you, Evariste?
- I'm well, ma'am, thank God.

11:14.340 --> 11:18.220
God has nothing to do with it. Everything
works in this country only thanks to whites.

11:18.667 --> 11:23.141
- When I say "God", I mean you, boss!
- Stop blathering on and clean up here!

11:23.182 --> 11:25.256
And bring three beers!

11:26.394 --> 11:31.831
Crowds of poor idlers in Bukava
kneel for alms. This country is going to hell.

11:31.950 --> 11:34.303
Come to Bujumbura
and settle down with me.

11:34.384 --> 11:36.744
I'm about to sign two
very profitable construction projects.

11:36.824 --> 11:40.656
No, Burundi is not for me.
I'm more Zairean than the blacks.

11:40.762 --> 11:44.228
- There are only problems with the Burundians.
- I'm tired of it here, too.

11:44.354 --> 11:48.029
Jacques, she's just dreaming
of moving to Paris.

11:48.177 --> 11:50.643
I can barely stand it.
Let's get out of that hole.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.883
Why "a hole"?
Don't you like your house?

11:54.020 --> 11:56.967
Don't you have enough space?
Not enough servants... or enough sun?

11:57.008 --> 12:00.448
- I didn't want to live in Bujumbura.
- But this is your home!

12:00.565 --> 12:04.378
No, no, no, Michel.
My home is Rwanda, on the other side.

12:04.463 --> 12:07.997
- And you know what I am to the Burundians.
- Yes, a refugee.

12:08.097 --> 12:11.857
- Yes, refugee, what's so funny?
- That's all you keep saying.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.443
True, because here,
I will always be a refugee.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.025
What will you be in France?
There will be no one!

12:17.127 --> 12:20.147
At least my children
will grow up safe.

12:20.253 --> 12:21.783
You are a French citizen.

12:21.825 --> 12:25.249
How many Africans would
change places with you?

12:25.495 --> 12:30.417
Leave that racism for colonizers like Jacques.
It doesn't suit old hippies like you.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.817
Okay. Where is the beer?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.193
Get your hands off! I'm sick of it.

12:58.267 --> 13:01.698
- As long as you're angry.
- You don't think what you're saying.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.045
Yes, yes, go on behaving like that.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.453
Don't you dare touch me!
I'm tired!

13:06.494 --> 13:08.936
How much longer do I have to endure?

13:09.464 --> 13:11.792
Will you ever stop this hysteria?

13:11.834 --> 13:16.460
- Is it hysteria? So I'm hysterical?
- Gaby, I peed.

13:17.622 --> 13:21.165
- Go and tell Mom.
- No! Quiet.

13:21.259 --> 13:28.641
What are you talking about, Yvonne?
What other woman?

13:28.781 --> 13:32.693
Do you think I'm blind?
Do you think I'm an idiot?

13:32.800 --> 13:35.714
The phone rang ten times
and ten times they hung up.

13:35.820 --> 13:39.253
- You gave her our home number!
- What?

13:39.294 --> 13:41.623
Can't I give our number to anyone?

13:41.736 --> 13:46.311
I have too many problems
to deal with your fantasies on top of them.

13:46.494 --> 13:50.013
My fantasies?
You have a mistress, and I should shut up?

13:50.120 --> 13:52.625
I shouldn't have given
birth to your children!

13:52.690 --> 13:55.838
- Children?! You're talking about children?
- You wanted them, did you forget?

13:55.924 --> 13:57.844
Don't you dare
talk to me like that!

13:57.964 --> 14:01.633
- You have responsibilities as a father!
- How much more can you scream?

14:01.784 --> 14:03.718
You do nothing but
scream, scream, scream!

14:03.813 --> 14:08.108
- Aren't you tired?
- I won't get tired!

14:08.235 --> 14:11.198
Don't listen to the gossip
in Bujumbura!

14:11.311 --> 14:14.333
- They saw you with her!
- Who did they see me with?

14:14.446 --> 14:18.051
- I work with a lot of people.
- They saw you with her!

14:18.178 --> 14:20.124
I'm tired of you!
And you know what?

14:20.211 --> 14:23.766
- I stopped being ashamed a long time ago!
- Go away! Disappear!

14:23.876 --> 14:27.868
Go to your whore from the embassy,
while I look after your children! Get out!

14:33.489 --> 14:34.754
Go to bed.

14:34.870 --> 14:37.384
Stop crying, or I'll slap you.

14:38.407 --> 14:41.687
- Go to bed.
- Calixte?

14:42.855 --> 14:46.607
- I was joking!
- Calixte, my cigarettes!

15:16.243 --> 15:18.230
<i>Does your nose bother you a lot?</i>

15:18.349 --> 15:21.421
<i>Are you scared?
Maybe it stretches like a trunk?</i>

15:21.462 --> 15:25.122
<i>He's small, like a dwarf!</i>

15:26.024 --> 15:29.488
<i>I was expecting ridicule, even death.
My nose is small...</i>

15:29.612 --> 15:33.136
<i>- You're a liar!
- God, my nose is huge!</i>

15:35.536 --> 15:37.303
Bastard!

15:41.856 --> 15:43.485
That's enough!

15:43.763 --> 15:45.466
Gino! Pascal!

15:45.869 --> 15:47.464
Stop now!

15:47.650 --> 15:51.178
Are you crazy?! What is going on here?
Gino?

15:51.291 --> 15:53.978
- Nothing, madam.
- What do you mean, nothing? You won't tell me?

15:54.060 --> 15:56.986
What happened, Pascal?
Tell me now.

15:57.861 --> 16:00.733
Okay, to the principal's office.
Come on!

16:00.861 --> 16:04.117
Felicite, you'll lead the class.
Gino, stop it!

16:05.041 --> 16:06.261
What happened?

16:06.347 --> 16:09.629
Pascal said the Tutsis
have noses like Cyrano.

16:09.756 --> 16:13.188
And Gino replied that at least they
didn't have shit for brains like the Hutus.

16:13.301 --> 16:18.229
And Pascal said
your mother has an ugly nose like Depardieu.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.312
I will not let this idiot Pascal
insult my mother.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.967
I'll teach this ugly Hutu
to respect us!

16:25.060 --> 16:27.279
But you are half white.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.656
- My mother is Tutsi!
- Your father is Belgian!

16:29.697 --> 16:32.909
And according to tradition, you are Tutsi
only if your father is Tutsi.

16:32.950 --> 16:36.538
You know nothing about this country.
Anywhere you look, it's only us and the Hutus!

16:36.579 --> 16:40.499
- You're just talking nonsense.
- To live here, you have to choose a side.

16:40.540 --> 16:43.549
And if I don't, what will you do?
Will you split the class in two?

16:43.591 --> 16:46.049
One side for the Tutsis,
and the other for the Hutus?

16:46.091 --> 16:47.066
Nonsense!

16:47.162 --> 16:50.179
- Why are we arguing about nonsense?
- This is not nonsense!

16:50.279 --> 16:53.309
This is important!
When you are a Tutsi, you are a Tutsi.

16:59.046 --> 17:02.372
Your mother and I have decided
to live separately for a while...

17:05.502 --> 17:08.084
But if you want, Ana,
you can live with her.

17:08.217 --> 17:12.771
- No, I want to stay with Gaby.
- Alright, stay with Gaby.

17:16.854 --> 17:18.307
Will Mom come back?

17:18.420 --> 17:23.604
Of course. She will take you on Sundays,
and you will visit your grandmother.

17:24.600 --> 17:25.932
What about Christmas?

17:26.052 --> 17:28.856
No. On Christmas,
Mom will travel to her family in Rwanda.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.308
The three of us will celebrate Christmas.

18:02.175 --> 18:06.022
You're sad because Mom
won't be with us at Christmas?

18:06.402 --> 18:08.982
We'll celebrate another Christmas
with her, okay?

18:28.493 --> 18:29.773
Ana, back off!

18:29.879 --> 18:32.719
- I'm first!
- Let me go, let me go!

18:32.909 --> 18:34.733
Let me go!

18:36.191 --> 18:38.024
Wow, a BMX bike!

18:38.151 --> 18:41.539
- Come on!
- A princess dress!

18:47.275 --> 18:49.362
Everyone freeze!

19:03.360 --> 19:05.922
Dad!
Wake up!

19:06.068 --> 19:09.229
Look what Santa brought me!
Look!

19:09.270 --> 19:12.314
- Who are you? But this is my daughter!
- What a dress!

19:12.431 --> 19:16.786
I'll eat you now.
I'm going to eat you whole!

19:17.490 --> 19:19.369
And who is this?

19:32.546 --> 19:33.799
Hey, Gino!

19:34.372 --> 19:36.666
What a beauty, a BMX bike!

19:36.820 --> 19:39.439
- Will you give me a ride?
- Yes, come on.

19:40.039 --> 19:43.459
- How was your Christmas?
- Mom flew in from Paris.

19:43.626 --> 19:45.952
She got three days off
from the UN.

19:46.120 --> 19:50.245
- Look what she bought me.
- What a beautiful watch!

19:51.118 --> 19:52.689
Can I try your bike?

19:58.973 --> 20:00.526
No, stop!

20:35.110 --> 20:37.225
Yes, he said it right.

20:37.611 --> 20:41.659
If you say that,
mom will be happy and proud of you.

20:43.417 --> 20:45.417
Thanks.

20:46.858 --> 20:48.859
Remember everything, huh?

20:49.532 --> 20:51.968
Now you put it on the plate...

20:52.068 --> 20:53.919
- Mom?
- Yes?

20:56.170 --> 20:58.004
Ah, you little parrot!

20:58.202 --> 21:00.089
What is this?

21:01.760 --> 21:05.026
- Did you learn it, Pacifique?
- I think we need to learn Kinyarwanda.

21:05.119 --> 21:08.305
- Mom, tell her I'm right.
- You know what he said?

21:08.405 --> 21:11.513
"I'm a little white fool!"
Don't listen to your uncle.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.799
- Go for a beer.
- Let's go, Gaby.

21:13.899 --> 21:19.058
- He must know our language. Kinyarwanda.
- You say the same thing every Sunday.

21:19.298 --> 21:22.387
- You sound like a broken record.
- Yvonne,

21:22.514 --> 21:24.628
your son is Rwandan,
whether you like it or not.

21:24.687 --> 21:28.770
And one day, he will regret
that he knows nothing about his country.

21:29.003 --> 21:30.933
Always the same, Mom.

21:31.187 --> 21:33.808
Pacifique, did you drop out of school?

21:33.928 --> 21:36.776
The other students have already gone
to the front. And I'm leaving soon.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.893
You're just going to keep quiet?
It wasn't enough that Alphonse died there?

21:40.018 --> 21:44.281
- He knows what he needs to do.
- What does he know? He's never been to Rwanda!

21:44.392 --> 21:48.371
Everyone has the right
to fight for his homeland.

21:48.511 --> 21:50.697
No one should be
a refugee all his life.

21:50.817 --> 21:53.479
You naively think that
Rwanda is paradise on earth.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.211
Habyarimana wants to destroy
all the Tutsis in the country.

21:56.318 --> 21:59.199
- Is this what you want?
- Mom hasn't been there in 30 years.

21:59.426 --> 22:04.209
And when the opportunity arises to go home,
you want to go to war.

22:04.355 --> 22:06.869
- We need to regain power.
- What power?

22:06.910 --> 22:10.709
- There is an offer to share power.
- You're a coward.

22:10.750 --> 22:15.447
- And you're a real fool!
- Yvonne, Pacifique! Stop it, both of you!

22:15.521 --> 22:19.089
Shut up, that's enough!
I'm tired of it!

22:27.766 --> 22:29.793
Don't you need a mattress?

22:30.625 --> 22:31.799
No.

22:32.496 --> 22:34.657
That's how I train.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.353
For the war?

22:37.451 --> 22:38.687
Yes.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.655
GOD IS ALMIGHTY

22:45.151 --> 22:47.078
Do you believe in God,
Pacifique?

22:51.506 --> 22:52.420
No,

22:52.506 --> 22:54.267
I'm a communist.

22:54.860 --> 22:56.539
I believe in the people.

22:57.265 --> 22:59.348
I don't believe in God, either.

23:10.792 --> 23:14.090
<i>In Burundi, the election campaign
is in full swing.</i>

23:14.230 --> 23:17.631
<i>The Burundians will choose a new president</i>

23:17.735 --> 23:20.865
<i>and a new Council of Ministers.</i>

23:26.589 --> 23:29.096
- Why are you here? Where is Calixte?
- Calixte is gone.

23:29.177 --> 23:31.736
- What do you mean?
- He left early in the morning.

23:31.801 --> 23:34.597
- He will not return.
- Move.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.907
What did he do?

23:37.120 --> 23:39.726
- He stole a lot of things.
- Like what?

23:39.813 --> 23:43.015
A wheelbarrow, welding equipment, sheers.

23:43.100 --> 23:44.812
And many other things.

23:45.415 --> 23:47.236
I'll deal with this
on Monday.

23:47.329 --> 23:51.719
- Dad, Calixte stole Gaby's bike!
- He won't stop crying.

24:05.854 --> 24:09.281
Prothé told me about your bike.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.494
We will get it back to you.

24:20.500 --> 24:25.629
<i>One of the candidates for the
presidency of Burundi is Melchior Ndadaye,</i>

24:25.670 --> 24:27.857
<i>the main rival
of the incumbent president.</i>

24:27.951 --> 24:31.678
<i>Ndadaye is the leader of FRODEBU
in Burundi, and is a Hutu.</i>

24:31.758 --> 24:33.993
<i>President Buyoya is a Tutsi.</i>

24:34.093 --> 24:39.783
<i>Ndadaye has been criticized and accused of
building his campaign on an ethnic platform...</i>

25:00.569 --> 25:04.459
- Where are you from?
- Do you see that house?

25:04.500 --> 25:06.904
The one on the left.

25:07.069 --> 25:09.299
Go and ask about Léonce's mother.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.299
- Will you come?
- I don't want to get my shoes dirty.

25:12.341 --> 25:16.099
I will be waiting for you here.
See how many Hutus there are around.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.670
Do not touch the car!
Get out of the car!

25:18.737 --> 25:20.229
- Can I get on?
- No.

25:30.969 --> 25:33.909
- Are you Léonce's mother?
- Yes, I'm his mother.

25:33.982 --> 25:35.869
- Good day.
- Good day to you, too.

25:35.911 --> 25:38.639
So you know where his bike is.

25:38.806 --> 25:43.334
Yes, I know, yes.
I will call someone to take you.

25:43.491 --> 25:47.009
Godfrey, Balthasar!
Come here, quickly!

25:47.907 --> 25:48.940
What?

25:49.040 --> 25:51.219
Come here. We need your help.

25:51.300 --> 25:56.389
Show them the way to Mathias.
They came for the bike.

26:09.625 --> 26:11.012
Mathias?

26:11.072 --> 26:13.738
They came for the bike
which he bought.

26:13.878 --> 26:16.164
I have already sold it to Jean Bosco.

26:16.317 --> 26:19.223
- Where does he live?
- On the way to the avocado grove.

26:19.297 --> 26:22.749
- You can't miss it.
- I know where it is. Come with me.

26:30.639 --> 26:33.245
Matthias said
that the child's bicycle is with you.

26:33.392 --> 26:36.509
I bought it, but it is no longer with me.

26:36.745 --> 26:39.099
I sold it to a farmer in Gitaba.

26:48.768 --> 26:50.494
Let's go.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.339
Why do you have 50 people in the car?

27:08.380 --> 27:10.589
Tell them to get off.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.247
- We are looking for the child's bike.
- Let us pass.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.017
Get down, fast.

27:15.749 --> 27:17.646
Boss, I need this boy.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.599
All right.

27:37.251 --> 27:38.964
- Hello.
- Hello.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.212
Hello.
What do you want?

27:41.325 --> 27:43.289
We came to get the bike.

27:43.515 --> 27:45.375
- What bike?
- The one stolen from us.

27:45.443 --> 27:46.509
My bike!

27:46.602 --> 27:49.482
I bought it for my son!

27:49.574 --> 27:53.009
- I bought it! This is our bike!
- It's not yours!

27:53.050 --> 27:57.679
It was stolen from my boss.
You hear me? It's stolen.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.059
Are you listening to me?
I bought it!

28:00.140 --> 28:04.306
- Boscu sold you a stolen bicycle.
- I bought it from Jean Bosco!

28:04.399 --> 28:08.327
- Calixte stole it from the boss.
- I paid for it!

28:08.480 --> 28:10.981
- Enough, I'm taking it.
- You can't!

28:11.087 --> 28:13.295
- Move away.
- It can't be that way.

28:13.369 --> 28:14.739
I spent all my money.

28:14.935 --> 28:17.668
I know nothing about that,
they stole it from us.

28:17.775 --> 28:21.921
I bought it! I didn't steal it!
Who are you really?

28:22.048 --> 28:25.499
- Give me the bike!
- Move away! Everybody pull away. Gaby!

28:26.127 --> 28:29.396
This is worse than theft.

28:29.838 --> 28:32.217
You're defending these peasants?

28:32.616 --> 28:34.549
Even a fool could see
that they're lying.

28:34.590 --> 28:37.075
All Hutus are liars
and should not be trusted!

28:37.163 --> 28:41.719
- You can't take it!
- It's over, we're done, back off.

28:41.760 --> 28:45.630
What are you doing?
How can that be?

28:54.697 --> 28:58.124
I will not touch this bike again, I swear.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.673
- You told me, but...
- You're always kidding.

29:03.793 --> 29:06.826
- Mom, can I go swimming?
- I said, at three in the afternoon.

29:06.899 --> 29:11.103
If you are bored,
get some sleep with the others.

29:12.241 --> 29:14.368
Does anyone know what the gift was?

29:14.772 --> 29:18.621
- We know what the gift was.
- And what was it?

29:23.354 --> 29:27.579
♪ We will win this election,
there is no doubt! ♪

29:28.020 --> 29:29.896
♪ Get up, citizen! ♪

29:30.076 --> 29:32.899
♪ Vote for the FRODEBU! ♪

29:32.940 --> 29:37.706
He needs to look the truth in the eyes.
He got married to be a good African,

29:37.953 --> 29:42.043
and got married
to go shopping on the Champs-Élysées.

29:43.746 --> 29:46.259
Time has passed since
my mom used to tell me

29:46.473 --> 29:49.006
what to do in bed with a boy.

29:49.561 --> 29:51.824
You're absolutely right, Yvonne.

29:51.969 --> 29:55.299
In his eyes, the children are half black.
To me, they are half white.

29:55.341 --> 29:58.799
Parents may not see
their children as the same color.

29:58.841 --> 30:01.632
- Will the judge understand that? I don't know.
- I don't know.

30:02.018 --> 30:03.219
Gaby,

30:03.260 --> 30:04.739
what did I say?

30:05.222 --> 30:07.291
I told you to go play.

30:18.673 --> 30:22.308
Gaby! Get out of there now, scumbag!

30:39.742 --> 30:43.089
You jumped into the pool
in front of my friends!

30:43.130 --> 30:45.335
What will they think of me now?

30:45.452 --> 30:47.059
- Why did you do this?
- Don't answer!

30:47.100 --> 30:49.616
Disgracing me
in front of everyone, fool!

30:49.749 --> 30:51.389
It's not fair!

30:51.482 --> 30:55.599
- You don't even know why Gaby jumped in!
- Well, tell me why.

30:56.063 --> 30:59.529
Because you were saying nasty things about Dad
in front of those fat women.

31:32.047 --> 31:34.907
I wish everyone a happy 1993.

31:35.151 --> 31:38.067
- Thanks.
- Sit down.

31:41.834 --> 31:43.087
Well...

31:43.440 --> 31:46.080
You all know that
this year, for the first time,

31:46.220 --> 31:50.104
the Burundians will choose
the next President of the Republic themselves,

31:50.224 --> 31:56.120
in a free and democratic election.
This is a very important event for the country.

31:57.330 --> 32:00.665
Can anyone explain to us
what democracy is?

32:02.018 --> 32:04.085
It's like in France, teacher.

32:04.506 --> 32:07.492
Yes, but what makes France a democracy?

32:07.605 --> 32:08.949
- Madam?
- Yes, Gino?

32:09.049 --> 32:13.416
Because before that, the kings did whatever
they wanted, and that's why they killed them.

32:13.490 --> 32:14.616
Thank you, Gino.

32:14.703 --> 32:17.766
Take out your social sciences notebooks...

32:17.853 --> 32:20.519
- Oh, we're writing again!
- ...and write down:

32:20.776 --> 32:23.211
<i>"Democracy is a system of government,</i>

32:23.344 --> 32:26.417
<i>"in which power
is in the hands of the people,</i>

32:26.624 --> 32:28.819
<i>"not one man."</i>

32:29.120 --> 32:32.539
JUNE 1, 1993

32:32.830 --> 32:35.268
Your documents.

32:35.580 --> 32:38.229
Give it to me!
Pass!

32:38.790 --> 32:41.589
- Gaby, catch the ball.
- I'll catch up with you!

32:42.252 --> 32:44.719
Hey, boy, come here.

32:45.136 --> 32:47.679
- Will you help the blind gentleman?
- Yes.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.064
You can accompany me to the polls.

32:50.223 --> 32:51.996
Take the ballot.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.136
Okay, accompany him.

32:54.310 --> 32:56.079
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

32:56.233 --> 32:57.939
- Can you read?
- Yes.

32:57.980 --> 33:00.349
Today is a historic day, boy!

33:00.500 --> 33:02.069
Truly historic!

33:02.110 --> 33:03.928
Read what it says here.

33:04.098 --> 33:07.662
"Pierre-Calva Sandgia,
the People's Reconciliation Party. (PRP)"

33:08.243 --> 33:11.045
"Melchior Ndadaye,
Front for Democracy in Burundi. (FRODEBU)"

33:11.574 --> 33:14.945
"Pierre Buyoya,
Union for National Progress (UPRONA)."

33:15.189 --> 33:18.270
- Who are you for? Okay.
- Melchior Ndadaye, FRODEBU!

33:18.748 --> 33:20.368
FRODEBU!

33:21.176 --> 33:22.548
FRODEBU!

33:25.630 --> 33:28.129
- Are you done?
- Yes, yes, I'm done.

33:28.170 --> 33:30.536
- You're not confused about something?
- No, no.

33:30.669 --> 33:32.139
Excellent. Thank you.

33:32.746 --> 33:34.959
<i>There haven't been
free elections in Burundi</i>

33:35.109 --> 33:37.244
<i>since the independence
of the state,</i>

33:37.393 --> 33:39.873
<i>but today,
the people have come to vote</i> en masse.

33:39.950 --> 33:45.128
<i>We're happy to announce
that no incidents have been reported.</i>

33:45.254 --> 33:50.124
<i>At the end of the day, tensions have
dissipated even in the Bujumbura region,</i>

33:50.217 --> 33:54.369
<i>the center of the opposition,
where the situation is most complex.</i>

33:59.410 --> 34:01.499
Dad is hanging on the phone all day.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.807
- There are rumors spreading at the embassies.
- Rumors of what?

34:04.940 --> 34:07.992
- That FRODEBU has won the election.
- Are you satisfied?

34:08.089 --> 34:10.463
You made the old man happy,
and you marked as he wanted.

34:10.554 --> 34:14.299
If FRODEBU won the majority of votes,
Ndadaye will be president.

34:14.340 --> 34:16.342
- All elections end like this.
- Gaby,

34:16.436 --> 34:19.156
are you pretending,
or do you really not understand?

34:19.269 --> 34:22.559
If the Hutus come to power,
they will expel all Tutsis from the country.

34:22.600 --> 34:26.109
There will be chaos here
that you can't imagine.

34:26.150 --> 34:30.369
<i>- FRODEBU's Ndadaye has 61% of the vote.</i>
- Gaby, shall we play before bed?

34:30.450 --> 34:32.508
<i>The Union for National Progress,</i>

34:32.572 --> 34:37.619
<i>the ruling party, shrouds itself in
worrying silence... and acknowledges defeat.</i>

34:37.660 --> 34:42.181
What does it matter who wins,
if the army is behind the Union party?

34:42.321 --> 34:44.064
I'll tell you
what I'm afraid of.

34:44.171 --> 34:47.198
I'm afraid that if FRODEBU presses them,

34:47.318 --> 34:49.549
they may decide to take revenge.

34:50.539 --> 34:52.232
Dad, will you stay with us?

34:52.338 --> 34:55.484
Yes, darling, I will stay with you tonight.
Give me a kiss.

34:55.631 --> 34:58.407
Dad, I don't understand the difference
between Hutus and Tutsis.

34:58.501 --> 35:01.418
- Very simple. They have different noses.
- I'm being serious.

35:01.493 --> 35:04.324
Hutus are short with wide noses,

35:04.417 --> 35:07.396
and Tutsis are tall and thin,
with narrow noses,

35:07.463 --> 35:09.238
like mom.
And they're very secretive.

35:09.337 --> 35:12.185
You're Tutsi, and I never know
what's going through your mind.

35:12.263 --> 35:15.293
- Dad, what am I?
- You're a naughty girl!

35:15.493 --> 35:18.279
And you're going to bed right now!

35:18.320 --> 35:21.579
The Hutu and the Tutsi are fighting
because they want the same territory?

35:21.620 --> 35:24.377
They have the same country,
the same language and the same religion.

35:24.457 --> 35:26.249
- Then why the fighting?
- It's a nose war.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.719
- Enough...
- And our Prothé is a Hutu.

35:28.826 --> 35:32.973
Well done! Madam knows everything!
And now go to bed...

35:33.968 --> 35:35.219
and turn off the light!

35:35.260 --> 35:38.683
- Will the new president fix things?
- Come on, turn it off, Gaby.

35:38.816 --> 35:42.477
- Will he take revenge on the Tutsis?
- No one will take revenge on anyone.

35:42.617 --> 35:44.099
Will mom be okay?

35:44.140 --> 35:45.760
Of course, don't worry.

35:45.843 --> 35:47.091
Turn it off now.

35:47.462 --> 35:48.918
Good night.

35:50.820 --> 35:52.249
Pass it, pass it!

35:52.778 --> 35:57.895
- Give it to me!
- Who are you passing it to?

35:58.453 --> 36:00.566
Pass faster!

36:00.675 --> 36:04.539
- Francis, give us the ball back!
- Give us the ball! Hey!

36:04.737 --> 36:08.635
- Francis, give us the ball!
- Stop it already!

36:09.001 --> 36:10.093
Hey, Francis!

36:10.180 --> 36:14.224
Don't tell me what to do.
This is a public beach.

36:14.299 --> 36:16.915
It's my friend's birthday.
Stop it!

36:17.047 --> 36:19.909
You want the ball?
Come get it! Come on!

36:20.004 --> 36:22.559
You want it so much?
Come get it!

36:22.640 --> 36:24.447
- Dad!
- Yes?

36:24.549 --> 36:26.928
We were playing,
but Francis stole the ball from us

36:27.030 --> 36:29.519
and now Gino and Francis
are fighting!

36:29.560 --> 36:30.861
Come and get it!

36:30.974 --> 36:33.914
Come on, Gino!
Show him!

36:34.094 --> 36:35.859
Damn it, Gino!

36:35.901 --> 36:40.041
Come on, Gino!
Show him!

36:40.780 --> 36:43.380
What's going on here?
Hey, back off!

36:43.500 --> 36:46.874
Get away from each other!
Let him go! Let him go!

36:47.321 --> 36:50.435
Let him go, damn it!
Stop it!

36:50.507 --> 36:52.562
- Let me go!
- What are you?

36:52.662 --> 36:55.049
None of your business.
Let me go, you white bastard!

36:55.240 --> 36:58.509
- What did you say?
- Fuck you!

36:58.551 --> 37:01.099
Get out of here!

37:01.287 --> 37:04.139
- You will pay for it, freaks!
- Get lost!

37:14.488 --> 37:16.881
Gaby, Mom's coming.

37:17.118 --> 37:18.701
What?

37:19.701 --> 37:21.489
It's your turn!

37:21.530 --> 37:23.771
Mom!

37:24.019 --> 37:26.743
My darlings.
Everything's fine, my darlings.

37:26.856 --> 37:31.251
- Will you stay with us?
- I came to celebrate your brother's birthday.

37:32.774 --> 37:34.148
- How are you?
- Good.

37:34.232 --> 37:37.879
Are you having fun here?
I'm so glad to see you.

37:39.446 --> 37:40.799
Look at Gaby!

37:54.089 --> 37:56.033
Take the box.

37:59.731 --> 38:02.317
Jacques, give me your lighter, please.

38:05.870 --> 38:10.258
♪ Happy birthday, dear Gaby! ♪

38:10.574 --> 38:15.382
♪ Happy Birthday to you! ♪

38:16.619 --> 38:19.316
- Gaby, blow out the candles!
- Make a wish.

38:19.414 --> 38:21.429
Come on, blow them out!

38:26.454 --> 38:27.849
This is from
Mom and me.

38:27.890 --> 38:31.367
We are proud of you, Gaby,
in honor of your promotion to sixth grade.

38:31.495 --> 38:33.540
A video camera!

38:36.261 --> 38:38.229
Thanks, Mom.

38:39.189 --> 38:41.149
- You like it?
- Thank you, Dad.

39:09.449 --> 39:11.596
Come on, there's no one.

39:12.036 --> 39:13.849
Come on, air's clear.
Just be quiet.

39:18.900 --> 39:21.961
- Three in one go.
- Go on!

39:31.660 --> 39:34.525
- Take that off. Do you see it?
- There, there, there.

39:40.904 --> 39:42.692
Thieves!

39:42.880 --> 39:44.009
Run!

39:44.090 --> 39:47.349
They're stealing our mangoes!
Hold them, hold them!

39:47.430 --> 39:49.469
Little thieves!

40:08.061 --> 40:11.829
Steal from my garden, huh?!
From my garden!

40:25.192 --> 40:27.389
Here you are!
It's for your birthday!

40:41.603 --> 40:44.043
Ah, you little shitheads!

40:49.346 --> 40:51.360
Your mothers are whores for the whites!

40:51.464 --> 40:53.766
Shut up, bastard!

40:55.322 --> 40:57.128
Don't talk about my mother!

40:57.227 --> 40:59.789
I'll talk about whoever I want.

40:59.830 --> 41:01.758
- Where is she now?
- Fuck you!

41:01.865 --> 41:04.959
Where is she,
you piece of shit?

41:05.000 --> 41:06.469
- Enough!
- Where is she?

41:06.550 --> 41:07.969
Let him go!

41:08.157 --> 41:09.889
Francis, enough!

41:10.447 --> 41:11.679
Let him go!

41:11.760 --> 41:15.260
Where is she?
We never see her in the neighborhood.

41:17.530 --> 41:19.583
She's dead!

41:33.325 --> 41:35.425
Leave me alone!

42:54.025 --> 42:56.239
Go back, go back.

42:56.280 --> 42:57.829
Pacifique!

42:57.996 --> 42:59.585
Pacifique!

43:00.568 --> 43:02.918
Where are you going?

43:15.720 --> 43:20.780
<i>On the free multi-party elections
in Burundi...</i>

43:20.946 --> 43:23.613
- Hello, boss.
- Hello.

43:24.709 --> 43:26.473
Yes, I hear you well.

43:26.689 --> 43:28.404
Gaby, make me some coffee.

43:28.536 --> 43:31.362
FRODEBU won in the villages.

43:31.887 --> 43:33.909
Were you able to talk to Maxim?

43:35.226 --> 43:37.271
Okay, I'm waiting.

43:37.780 --> 43:41.350
- Did you know that Prothé didn't come today?
- He'll be back.

43:41.660 --> 43:43.373
Marcel! Marcel!

43:43.490 --> 43:46.960
- Don't forget to feed the dog.
- Of course, boss.

43:48.982 --> 43:52.289
Yes-- Gaby,
don't leave the neighborhood today.

43:52.655 --> 43:55.339
I'm listening.
What's going on?

43:57.504 --> 44:00.179
- Why is he here?
- Francis is in our gang now, too.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.679
That's very interesting.
You didn't think to ask me?

44:02.991 --> 44:04.814
You're really dumb.

44:05.674 --> 44:07.067
Wait!

44:07.690 --> 44:10.056
He is a Tutsi.
It's not what you think.

44:10.103 --> 44:12.535
He almost drowned you.
He's a complete freak.

44:12.622 --> 44:16.029
He's already apologized for that.
Gaby, I swear he's fine.

44:16.280 --> 44:17.685
Stop it!

44:17.813 --> 44:19.239
He lost his mother, too.

44:19.548 --> 44:23.119
- You change after a thing like that.
- Why didn't you tell me?

44:41.776 --> 44:45.019
We are brothers in blood
and I love you most of all.

44:45.615 --> 44:47.030
Let's go.

45:01.575 --> 45:05.735
OCTOBER 21, 1993

45:25.129 --> 45:26.589
Marcel!

45:54.310 --> 45:55.729
Gaby!

45:55.770 --> 45:57.589
Gaby!

46:00.295 --> 46:02.818
- And the dog? And the dog?
- Come in. Come on, get in!

46:08.520 --> 46:10.140
Lie down.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.192
What's up, Gaby?

46:17.320 --> 46:18.766
I don't know.

46:19.200 --> 46:21.679
Lie down. Daddy will be back soon.

47:08.716 --> 47:11.563
- Gaby, should we call Mom?
- No, Gertrude.

47:11.698 --> 47:13.736
She must be at home.

47:20.279 --> 47:23.319
- Dad, where have you been all night?
- Dad, what's going on?

47:23.386 --> 47:25.623
Quiet, I'm home now.
Everything is fine.

47:25.722 --> 47:28.715
There were shots last night!

47:28.802 --> 47:31.232
- And a helicopter flew over the house.
- Don't be afraid.

47:31.325 --> 47:33.639
I'm here, I'm here, everything's fine.
Calm down.

47:37.100 --> 47:39.158
Everything's fine.

47:47.313 --> 47:50.489
Listen... Gaby, take your mattress
and put it in the hallway.

47:50.530 --> 47:53.079
Ana, get your bedding
and collect your toys.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.635
Come on,

47:55.115 --> 47:57.039
collect your toys.

47:58.105 --> 48:01.049
Come on, come on.
Ana, don't stop.

48:11.043 --> 48:12.887
What happened?

48:42.003 --> 48:42.839
Yes?

48:43.850 --> 48:44.850
Yes?

48:46.720 --> 48:49.299
If the paratroopers abandoned Ndadaye,
they won't find him alive.

48:49.341 --> 48:52.099
And the police did not respond?

48:52.811 --> 48:56.125
- It's Gino.
- This is revenge for the president.

48:59.615 --> 49:00.756
Did you hear?

49:00.859 --> 49:04.218
Daddy came home and said to take
the mattresses out into the hallway.

49:04.319 --> 49:07.078
A military coup was carried out.
They killed the new president.

49:07.164 --> 49:09.098
- Are you serious?
- I am.

49:09.224 --> 49:11.279
A Canadian journalist
told my father.

49:11.801 --> 49:14.324
- Government officials have also been killed.
- No way!

49:14.431 --> 49:19.069
In response, the Hutus began
slaughtering Tutsis in the provinces.

49:19.176 --> 49:22.749
- Everything is in chaos.
- Dad hung up the phone.

49:30.580 --> 49:31.917
I'll let you talk to them.

49:32.050 --> 49:34.179
Take it, kids, it's mom.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.735
- Hello?
<i>- Ana, darling!</i>

49:37.808 --> 49:39.262
<i>How are you?
How is Gabriel?</i>

49:39.348 --> 49:41.189
- Everything is fine.
<i>- Were you scared?</i>

49:41.231 --> 49:42.146
Yes.

49:42.239 --> 49:47.015
We were scared, because we were
alone without you and without Dad.

49:47.159 --> 49:48.609
<i>Dad won't leave you anymore.</i>

49:48.650 --> 49:52.223
<i>We're starting the news
with the military coup in Burundi.</i>

49:52.343 --> 49:55.703
<i>Commanders of the coup
established a Public Safety Committee</i>

49:55.797 --> 49:59.052
<i>and declared a state of emergency.</i>

49:59.138 --> 50:02.229
<i>The state borders have been closed
and a curfew was imposed.</i>

50:02.322 --> 50:07.181
<i>Melchior Ndadaye was ousted from power
yesterday morning. His fate is unknown.</i>

50:07.274 --> 50:14.469
<i>Radio Rwanda reports that the president
and some of his associates were killed.</i>

50:16.178 --> 50:18.724
- Who's there?
- Donatien.

50:19.576 --> 50:21.760
- Are you okay?
- By the grace of God.

50:21.884 --> 50:24.711
- They still shooting?
- The army is here. Soldiers on every corner.

50:24.791 --> 50:27.888
- Searching houses and setting fire to them.
- But where is your family?

50:27.957 --> 50:30.272
I don't have the strength to speak.

50:30.542 --> 50:32.520
They killed all my hope.

50:33.220 --> 50:35.963
- Prothé!
- Hello.

50:36.219 --> 50:38.578
- What should I prepare for you today?
- Scrambled eggs.

50:38.718 --> 50:41.160
And you? What do you want, Ana?

50:41.260 --> 50:42.619
- Crepes.
- Crepes it is.

50:42.660 --> 50:44.480
Do you know what time it is?

50:44.606 --> 50:46.434
I think the school is open today.

50:46.530 --> 50:49.117
Let's go. Go ahead! Hurry!

50:49.322 --> 50:51.251
Gather your things!

50:52.584 --> 50:54.092
Let's go.

50:56.335 --> 50:58.677
- Hello, boss. How are you doing?
- Hello, Innocent.

50:58.857 --> 51:00.367
I'll answer and go.

51:00.457 --> 51:03.620
- Innocent, hello! How are you?
- I'm fine, my friend.

51:03.720 --> 51:06.406
My God, what is this?
Are you still here?

51:06.487 --> 51:10.347
- What?
- What are you doing here?

51:10.453 --> 51:13.720
- Do you mind?
- Of course, damn it.

51:13.931 --> 51:17.869
- Calm down!
- I thought you were killed!

51:21.290 --> 51:24.039
Close your mouth,
or you will regret your words!

51:24.081 --> 51:27.106
Wait, I'll call you again.
Hey, stop it!

51:27.216 --> 51:29.879
- Enough!
- Let me beat him!

51:30.326 --> 51:32.963
Let him go!
Innocent!

51:33.388 --> 51:36.139
Stop right now! Let him go!

51:36.180 --> 51:40.679
Let him go! Go to the office
to get your salary.

51:41.332 --> 51:43.815
Yes, Boss. Yes.

51:49.446 --> 51:51.446
Don't fall behind!

52:18.720 --> 52:21.972
WELCOME TO RWANDA

52:22.462 --> 52:25.942
Gabriel, Ana!
How you've grown.

52:26.028 --> 52:28.282
How are you, Christian?
Is everything alright?

52:28.376 --> 52:31.111
Yvonne, I'm so glad
you came for the wedding.

52:31.198 --> 52:33.920
- Let's go.
- How you've grown.

52:34.053 --> 52:39.893
KIGALI AIRPORT,
RWANDA

53:04.448 --> 53:07.569
We'll sing louder than everyone!

53:07.659 --> 53:11.962
- One more time.
- We'll sing louder than everyone!

53:14.940 --> 53:17.772
Maradona...
Maradona moves to the defense...

53:18.320 --> 53:20.069
The ball is in. What's this?

53:20.110 --> 53:24.739
Roger Mila wants to stop him,
but Maradona breaks through!

53:24.947 --> 53:26.701
It's over, girls. This is it.

53:26.794 --> 53:29.039
- Time for bed.
- No!

53:29.080 --> 53:31.709
Christian,
I told you not to play ball at home.

53:33.855 --> 53:35.484
Move!

53:35.799 --> 53:38.837
I will not move from this bed.

53:49.114 --> 53:51.599
- Hello.
- Oh, the big sister!

53:51.640 --> 53:56.691
Thanks for coming quickly. I'm sorry for the
urgency, but I couldn't wait until the wedding.

53:56.788 --> 54:00.650
- Pacifique!
- Who is this sturdy guy? A real warrior.

54:00.732 --> 54:03.939
- Look at how you've grown.
- Let's go, let's go. Tell me everything.

54:04.021 --> 54:07.056
- Pacifique, your coat.
- Oh, yes, I forgot.

54:11.308 --> 54:12.480
So...

54:12.640 --> 54:15.647
Jean's family
maintains a devout tradition.

54:15.740 --> 54:18.193
We have to get married
because she is expecting a baby.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.377
- A baby?
- You're having a baby?

54:20.488 --> 54:23.858
- Eusébie, didn't you tell them?
- This is great news.

54:23.965 --> 54:27.139
- You'll have a cousin.
- Thank you, sister!

54:27.180 --> 54:29.452
You will become a father,
and you are a cousin.

54:29.570 --> 54:31.309
Didn't you change your mind?

54:31.436 --> 54:33.961
- No, I'm sure.
- You don't have to be so reckless.

54:34.071 --> 54:36.316
Remember Alfonso.
Think of Mom.

54:36.376 --> 54:38.636
As soon as he starts firing,
everyone will return home.

54:38.754 --> 54:44.809
- The UN, Belgium, France, Canada...
- They have a duty to help us.

54:46.200 --> 54:50.659
Take the children to Yusebi,
Jeanne and the baby to Burundi.

54:50.701 --> 54:54.135
- They will be safer in Burundi.
- Is it safe? There is a war going on.

54:54.207 --> 54:56.077
It will be even worse here.

54:56.191 --> 55:00.219
Jeanne and the children
can come when they want. You're exaggerating.

55:00.260 --> 55:02.514
We intercepted their negotiations.

55:02.620 --> 55:05.539
Hutu extremists will not hand over power.

55:05.612 --> 55:10.269
They will eliminate all opposition leaders,
and then they will destroy the Tutsis.

55:10.601 --> 55:12.689
- They'll kill us all!
- You just want to scare me.

55:13.130 --> 55:15.327
You know nothing
You don't know what I'm talking about.

55:15.770 --> 55:19.136
- Trust me.
- Pacifique, you need to leave.

55:20.475 --> 55:22.475
See you tomorrow at the wedding.

55:22.733 --> 55:24.989
- Be careful on the road, Eusébie.
- Of course.

55:40.531 --> 55:42.051
- Where are you going?
- To Gitarama...

55:42.130 --> 55:44.225
- Your documents.
- ...for his brother's wedding.

55:44.320 --> 55:45.925
Get out of the car.

56:12.219 --> 56:13.899
Your documents.

56:17.191 --> 56:19.374
Hello, Madame French.

56:20.676 --> 56:23.437
Not many French women with a nose like yours.

56:23.831 --> 56:26.505
- Get out, vermin!
- But my documents are valid.

56:26.611 --> 56:30.385
I need to search you.
Your Tutsi brothers are everywhere.

56:31.616 --> 56:33.977
Put your hands on the hood.

56:52.057 --> 56:55.684
You are free to go!
Madame French!

56:57.305 --> 56:59.416
The documents.

57:02.032 --> 57:04.719
You're lucky that
the French are our friends.

57:20.390 --> 57:23.660
- Hello.
- What beauties.

57:23.940 --> 57:26.520
- Hi, Gaby.
- Ana, hello.

57:34.542 --> 57:37.092
- Gaby, meet Jeanne.
- Hello.

57:37.332 --> 57:40.427
- Hello.
- Meet Jeanne's mother, too.

57:40.570 --> 57:44.523
My sister with her children.
This is Ana, and this is Gabriel.

57:44.650 --> 57:46.717
- Little Ana.
- Hello, sweetheart.

57:46.814 --> 57:51.469
My daughter-in-law is beautiful.
Just beautiful.

57:51.510 --> 57:52.863
What dress do you have?

57:52.936 --> 57:55.776
You won't take my pants off.
What a creep.

57:55.849 --> 57:58.540
I am a beautiful princess.

58:33.311 --> 58:35.311
Here you go.

58:38.150 --> 58:40.466
Thank you all for coming.

58:41.020 --> 58:43.394
It is a great honor for us.

59:32.042 --> 59:36.806
THREE MONTHS LATER
APRIL 7, 1994

1:00:07.789 --> 1:00:09.789
- Mom.
- Son.

1:00:14.344 --> 1:00:17.350
- Mom!
- It's all right, darling.

1:00:17.518 --> 1:00:20.449
Everything is fine, Mom is with you.
Everything is fine.

1:00:20.491 --> 1:00:23.104
<i>Last night, the presidents
of Rwanda and Burundi</i>

1:00:23.194 --> 1:00:26.628
<i>were killed in a plane crash
in Kigali, Rwanda.</i>

1:00:26.761 --> 1:00:29.658
<i>They were returning from
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,</i>

1:00:29.738 --> 1:00:31.611
<i>where there was
a meeting</i>

1:00:31.743 --> 1:00:34.699
<i>dedicated to stabilization of the
situation in the region.</i>

1:00:34.826 --> 1:00:38.343
<i>The plane appears to have been shot down
with a rocket or projectile,</i>

1:00:38.423 --> 1:00:39.989
<i>in an attack
planned in advance.</i>

1:00:40.083 --> 1:00:43.679
<i>Phone connections between the countries
has been patchy.</i>

1:00:43.838 --> 1:00:47.729
- Take the eggs.
<i>- In Bujumbura, it is fairly quiet.</i>

1:00:48.956 --> 1:00:51.178
- What happened?
- Have you heard the news?

1:00:51.386 --> 1:00:54.994
The Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi
were killed yesterday.

1:00:55.103 --> 1:00:57.359
Their plane was
shot down last night.

1:00:57.888 --> 1:01:00.239
Pacifique and Jean don't answer.
Neither does Eusébie.

1:01:01.792 --> 1:01:04.199
That's why I'm here.
I don't know what to do.

1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:05.777
I called ten times

1:01:05.864 --> 1:01:09.968
and I only ever hear your stupid music on hold
which calls on me to be patient.

1:01:10.118 --> 1:01:12.089
Yes, I'm sorry, madam.
I will calm down.

1:01:12.174 --> 1:01:14.776
Can I talk with anyone?

1:01:15.599 --> 1:01:17.532
Yes, please.

1:01:22.736 --> 1:01:24.875
Calm down!

1:01:25.642 --> 1:01:28.008
Ana! Ana, come here.

1:01:28.341 --> 1:01:31.719
<i>- Embassy of France in Kigali. Hello.</i>
- Yes, hello, madam.

1:01:31.817 --> 1:01:34.090
This is Michel Chappaz.
I'm French.

1:01:34.175 --> 1:01:38.127
My family is in Kigali
and needs to return to France.

1:01:38.273 --> 1:01:40.872
I'd like to know what measures
to take to get them out of here.

1:01:40.974 --> 1:01:43.436
<i>I know about the rumors
that are spreading,</i>

1:01:43.523 --> 1:01:48.296
<i>- but you have nothing to worry about.</i>
- I'm-- I'm not worried, but I want...

1:01:48.628 --> 1:01:51.744
my family to stay at the embassy
while I organize the trip.

1:01:51.831 --> 1:01:55.751
- I'll tell you their names--
<i>- We're not registering names yet,</i>

1:01:55.853 --> 1:01:59.238
<i>but if the situation worsens, France will
organize the departure of its citizens.</i>

1:01:59.364 --> 1:02:00.638
<i>Everything will be fine.</i>

1:02:00.728 --> 1:02:02.728
<i>- Have a nice day, sir.</i>
- Wait!

1:02:03.851 --> 1:02:05.439
Damn it.

1:02:08.216 --> 1:02:09.524
Ana, darling, stop it.

1:02:09.625 --> 1:02:11.537
Ana, enough, calm down.

1:02:17.730 --> 1:02:20.619
- Any success?
- Eusébie still doesn't answer.

1:02:39.590 --> 1:02:41.937
Ana, move the ashtray.

1:02:42.183 --> 1:02:44.219
Careful, it's hot.

1:02:44.504 --> 1:02:46.504
Pass me your plate.

1:02:47.588 --> 1:02:50.001
Here you go.

1:02:51.925 --> 1:02:54.562
- Is it enough? Or do you want more?
- No, that's enough.

1:02:54.647 --> 1:02:56.036
Eat.

1:03:04.093 --> 1:03:05.427
Hello?

1:03:07.173 --> 1:03:10.140
<i>- Yvonne, it's me.</i>
- Thank God! Finally!

1:03:10.290 --> 1:03:13.770
I've been calling you all day.
Yes, I hear you.

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:17.388
<i>I'm calling from the neighbors' phone.
The phone in the house is disconnected.</i>

1:03:17.502 --> 1:03:20.061
- Listen, we--
<i>- Everything is very bad here.</i>

1:03:20.164 --> 1:03:22.945
We called the French Embassy in Kigali

1:03:23.032 --> 1:03:26.562
and we asked if you could go there.
We're now waiting for an answer.

1:03:26.664 --> 1:03:29.437
<i>We won't make it to the embassy.</i>

1:03:29.603 --> 1:03:31.436
<i>All roads are blocked.</i>

1:03:31.599 --> 1:03:36.707
<i>The military and the presidential guard
are killing all the Tutsis.</i>

1:03:36.803 --> 1:03:40.540
<i>They killed an entire family next door,
can you imagine?</i>

1:03:42.166 --> 1:03:44.856
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, I hear you.

1:03:44.969 --> 1:03:47.904
Can you get to the
Church of the Holy Family?

1:03:47.990 --> 1:03:51.894
<i>Yvonne, what church?
Do you know what's going on here?</i>

1:03:51.985 --> 1:03:56.502
<i>The radio claims that
the Tutsis killed the president.</i>

1:03:56.576 --> 1:03:58.422
<i>They want to kill us all.</i>

1:03:58.496 --> 1:04:02.584
<i>- Pacifique was right, they hate us.</i>
- Eusébie, w-wait.

1:04:02.703 --> 1:04:06.759
<i>- They won't stop until they kill us.</i>
- Eusébie, trust Pacifique.

1:04:06.801 --> 1:04:08.083
He'll come for you.

1:04:08.153 --> 1:04:11.849
- Don't despair, darling.
<i>- Yvonne, I don't know what to do--</i>

1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:00.855
- Hello, Prothé!
- Hello, Gabriel.

1:05:00.940 --> 1:05:04.806
- You know, Mom's sleeping here.
- You must be very happy.

1:05:04.914 --> 1:05:08.029
Yes, but she is sad.
Eusébie called from Rwanda.

1:05:08.595 --> 1:05:11.062
Should we go straight to school,
or breakfast first?

1:05:11.137 --> 1:05:14.234
- Breakfast!
- Okay, but first, landing.

1:05:15.068 --> 1:05:17.069
Sit down, eat!

1:05:17.678 --> 1:05:20.079
How are you, Prothé?
You managed to get this far.

1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:23.249
- Better to work and not see the military.
- Of course.

1:05:23.290 --> 1:05:25.530
Dad, will Mom stay with us now?

1:05:25.616 --> 1:05:28.291
- Yes, it will stay for now.
- Hooray!

1:05:28.441 --> 1:05:31.274
- Mom is staying with us!
- Get off there.

1:05:31.381 --> 1:05:34.969
- Sit down, both of you.
- Mom is staying with us!

1:05:35.010 --> 1:05:38.229
Ana, Ana, get down.
Ana, eat like a normal person.

1:06:09.909 --> 1:06:13.800
<i>Good evening. The situation in Rwanda
continues to deteriorate.</i>

1:06:13.895 --> 1:06:15.720
<i>According to the
International Red Cross,</i>

1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:20.434
<i>thousands of people have already been killed
in violent incidents that erupted two days ago.</i>

1:06:20.528 --> 1:06:24.208
<i>Belgium and France are planning
to evacuate their citizens,</i>

1:06:24.322 --> 1:06:28.029
<i>who are mostly located
in the capital Kigali.</i>

1:06:28.245 --> 1:06:31.502
<i>In the last month, the city of Kigali
has been completely besieged.</i>

1:06:31.608 --> 1:06:34.739
<i>House-to-house searches
are being conducted by the military,</i>

1:06:34.780 --> 1:06:38.199
<i>who are killing all residents
suspected of hostile intentions.</i>

1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:41.695
<i>These people are being executed,
together with their whole family.</i>

1:06:44.948 --> 1:06:47.129
<i>How many people
have been killed in Rwanda?</i>

1:06:47.210 --> 1:06:48.648
<i>Nobody knows for sure.</i>

1:06:48.734 --> 1:06:52.853
<i>In six weeks,
a huge number of people have died,</i>

1:06:53.050 --> 1:06:55.963
<i>and every day
there are more and more victims.</i>

1:06:56.076 --> 1:06:59.889
<i>Due to indifference
of the international community,</i>

1:06:59.931 --> 1:07:03.729
<i>what is happening before our eyes
is genocide.</i>

1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:11.149
Everything will be fine.
Calm down.

1:07:32.701 --> 1:07:33.984
Hello?

1:07:34.538 --> 1:07:35.820
Hello?

1:07:37.414 --> 1:07:39.167
Ah, Pacifique.

1:07:39.532 --> 1:07:41.294
Pacifique!

1:07:43.448 --> 1:07:45.757
Have you heard anything about Eusébie?

1:07:47.244 --> 1:07:49.172
We know nothing here.

1:07:51.347 --> 1:07:54.126
You're sure we can really travel to Rwanda?

1:07:55.099 --> 1:07:56.559
I'm going to tell Mom.

1:07:59.007 --> 1:08:00.833
Yes, yes.

1:08:04.387 --> 1:08:07.477
Pacifique. Pacifique is alive.

1:08:08.904 --> 1:08:10.684
His army will save Eusébie.

1:08:10.850 --> 1:08:13.339
END OF THE TUTSI GENOCIDE
IN RWANDA, JULY 1994

1:08:13.829 --> 1:08:17.709
<i>Authorities in Rwanda have begun the initiative
to encourage the return of refugees.</i>

1:08:17.783 --> 1:08:21.622
<i>Some of their representatives can take part
in discussions in the government committee.</i>

1:08:21.717 --> 1:08:25.479
<i>After the conquest of Kigali by
the Rwandan Patriotic Front,</i>

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:30.017
<i>dozens of Tutsi families
return to the capital of Rwanda.</i>

1:08:30.112 --> 1:08:33.126
<i>Few of them know what awaits them
in this divided country,</i>

1:08:33.219 --> 1:08:35.959
<i>but hope to find their relatives alive.</i>

1:08:36.046 --> 1:08:39.699
<i>Patrick Verdier for the
International French Radio, Bujumbura.</i>

1:08:52.933 --> 1:08:54.933
Goodbye, Grandma.

1:08:56.572 --> 1:08:57.969
Take care, Yvonne.

1:08:58.209 --> 1:09:00.497
- Take care of the children.
- Goodbye, Grandma.

1:09:01.087 --> 1:09:03.824
- Goodbye, Michel.
- Goodbye, Mariana.

1:09:03.928 --> 1:09:07.197
I'll be back soon, do you hear?
Goodbye, darlings.

1:09:08.143 --> 1:09:10.189
Gaby, take care of your sister.

1:09:10.529 --> 1:09:12.555
Wow, pretty cramped, huh?

1:09:12.664 --> 1:09:15.322
- Like this.
- Nothing, nothing.

1:09:15.701 --> 1:09:18.989
Wide-open heart.
Goodbye. We're leaving.

1:09:28.174 --> 1:09:32.581
Goodbye, my dear.
Goodbye, goodbye.

1:09:33.830 --> 1:09:35.830
I love you.

1:09:52.871 --> 1:09:54.932
Gabriel, is everything okay?

1:09:57.700 --> 1:09:59.825
Let's go. Get in the car.

1:10:01.606 --> 1:10:03.668
- Do you want juice?
- Yes.

1:10:03.811 --> 1:10:05.728
Do you feel better?

1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:09.424
- Hello, Nadine.
- Hello.

1:10:09.524 --> 1:10:11.437
- How are you?
- Normal.

1:10:11.679 --> 1:10:13.536
This is Gabriel.

1:10:15.335 --> 1:10:17.919
Go and sit on the terrace.

1:10:18.644 --> 1:10:20.713
I'll pour it for you now.

1:10:24.361 --> 1:10:27.228
- Have you read all these books?
- Yes.

1:10:27.733 --> 1:10:29.822
Some of them several times.

1:10:30.140 --> 1:10:33.025
Thanks to them I have had many adventures.

1:10:34.836 --> 1:10:37.095
I also brought you biscuits.

1:10:43.392 --> 1:10:46.489
Ah, he woke up!
Let me show you something.

1:10:49.541 --> 1:10:51.246
Here, see.

1:10:56.168 --> 1:10:58.208
Oh, an owl!

1:11:00.303 --> 1:11:03.595
- Where did you find him?
- In the garden, this morning.

1:11:04.334 --> 1:11:06.450
I put him here to calm him down.

1:11:06.717 --> 1:11:08.302
Are you feeding him?

1:11:08.422 --> 1:11:11.689
I tried to give him some meat,
but he is not ready to eat anything.

1:11:11.955 --> 1:11:14.502
The meat should be mixed with insects.

1:11:14.671 --> 1:11:16.769
Without them, it is not tasty.

1:11:17.155 --> 1:11:19.155
Look, I got it.

1:11:30.355 --> 1:11:32.815
It's time for lunch, little one.

1:11:37.172 --> 1:11:38.852
He's eating.

1:11:39.054 --> 1:11:41.054
It worked!

1:11:42.616 --> 1:11:44.364
You know a lot about birds.

1:11:44.461 --> 1:11:46.357
My dad taught me.

1:11:46.853 --> 1:11:48.719
I want to give you a book.

1:11:49.106 --> 1:11:50.844
What is it about?

1:11:52.251 --> 1:11:53.926
You'll find out yourself.

1:11:54.124 --> 1:11:56.769
"Jack London. <i>White Fang</i>"

1:12:10.713 --> 1:12:14.226
- Hello?
<i>- Honey, is that you?</i>

1:12:14.426 --> 1:12:17.052
<i>- It's your grandmother calling.</i>
- Hello, Grandma!

1:12:17.471 --> 1:12:19.222
<i>How are you, darling?</i>

1:12:19.346 --> 1:12:22.392
I'm fine. Is Mom with you?

1:12:22.550 --> 1:12:26.679
<i>It was a quiet night in the city,
but ten people</i>

1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:30.059
<i>were killed in an exchange of gunfire
in northern Bujumbura</i>

1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:34.364
<i>in clashes between
Hutu and Tutsi militias.</i>

1:12:34.496 --> 1:12:36.939
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Ngagara.

1:12:36.981 --> 1:12:41.321
- This Frenchman wants to pass.
- The city is blocked, turn around.

1:12:41.363 --> 1:12:45.493
- It's very important to me, boss.
- You'll have to pay him.

1:12:47.110 --> 1:12:50.231
I will let you pass,
but for a fee.

1:12:50.357 --> 1:12:52.571
You are not in Europe now.

1:12:52.662 --> 1:12:55.289
You think you can go
wherever you want?

1:12:55.331 --> 1:12:57.919
Excellent.
Come on, come on.

1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:17.769
Close your eyes.

1:13:37.349 --> 1:13:38.788
I told Yvonne...

1:13:39.220 --> 1:13:40.903
to close her eyes...

1:13:41.042 --> 1:13:43.042
and not to look.

1:13:44.482 --> 1:13:46.482
There were bodies everywhere.

1:13:47.003 --> 1:13:48.839
Everywhere.

1:13:50.697 --> 1:13:53.124
Hundreds of corpses.

1:13:55.134 --> 1:13:57.579
Dead, dead...

1:13:57.858 --> 1:13:59.927
dead everywhere.

1:14:01.939 --> 1:14:03.269
We stopped...

1:14:04.096 --> 1:14:06.314
and we watched.

1:14:09.969 --> 1:14:13.422
We walked like... in a nightmare,

1:14:13.534 --> 1:14:15.889
until we arrived at Aunt Eusébie's house

1:14:16.053 --> 1:14:17.242
in Kigali.

1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:23.852
Then Yvonne entered the house.

1:14:24.943 --> 1:14:27.472
She found your cousins...

1:14:27.968 --> 1:14:29.856
in the living room,

1:14:30.110 --> 1:14:32.863
and Christian in the hallway.

1:14:35.184 --> 1:14:37.767
Aunt Eusébie was nowhere to be found.

1:14:38.427 --> 1:14:41.979
We searched for her all over the neighborhood

1:14:42.089 --> 1:14:45.512
but none of the neighbors knew where she was.

1:14:54.018 --> 1:14:59.118
Yvonne... decided to stay in the house
in case she returned.

1:15:01.511 --> 1:15:03.916
Gaby, you can
go to your sister if you want.

1:15:04.022 --> 1:15:05.390
No.

1:15:11.774 --> 1:15:13.529
Where is Yvonne now?

1:15:13.716 --> 1:15:17.209
I don't know.
I don't know where she went.

1:15:27.594 --> 1:15:30.293
<i>I went to the Pacifique.</i>

1:15:33.073 --> 1:15:36.437
<i>Jeanne and her whole family
were killed.</i>

1:15:37.772 --> 1:15:39.772
<i>Everyone.</i>

1:15:40.192 --> 1:15:44.459
<i>Pacifique found their killers
and avenged their deaths.</i>

1:15:45.447 --> 1:15:48.080
<i>He emptied his entire cartridge
on them.</i>

1:15:48.576 --> 1:15:50.882
<i>He was tried in a military court...</i>

1:15:51.147 --> 1:15:53.556
<i>he was sentenced to death...</i>

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:56.407
<i>and executed.</i>

1:15:56.927 --> 1:15:59.249
<i>He's dead.</i>

1:16:01.216 --> 1:16:03.269
That's what our people did,
Michel.

1:16:03.353 --> 1:16:05.353
His brothers in arms.

1:16:25.116 --> 1:16:26.449
Gaby?

1:16:27.529 --> 1:16:29.096
Why aren't you asleep?

1:16:29.245 --> 1:16:30.949
- I'm thirsty.
- Come here.

1:16:33.917 --> 1:16:35.841
Give me a kiss.

1:16:36.318 --> 1:16:38.318
Now go to sleep.

1:16:53.761 --> 1:16:55.149
Bring it here.

1:16:58.908 --> 1:17:00.136
Hello.

1:17:00.243 --> 1:17:02.177
Nadine, wash them, please.

1:17:02.304 --> 1:17:05.304
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, I'm going home.

1:17:05.564 --> 1:17:08.134
- Will we see each other again?
- I don't know.

1:17:08.261 --> 1:17:10.499
You brought the book back, okay.

1:17:12.363 --> 1:17:14.306
- Gaby?
- Thanks.

1:17:16.723 --> 1:17:17.857
So...

1:17:18.026 --> 1:17:21.011
I filled a box with books for you.

1:17:35.602 --> 1:17:37.003
Take it.

1:17:37.105 --> 1:17:39.173
This is a wonderful poem.

1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:41.489
Keep it to remember us.

1:17:41.611 --> 1:17:42.882
Thanks.

1:17:45.286 --> 1:17:47.332
Ah, he woke up.

1:17:48.290 --> 1:17:49.919
See, how strong he is.

1:17:50.660 --> 1:17:52.883
He's a tough little guy.

1:17:54.084 --> 1:17:55.799
Will we release him?

1:18:00.225 --> 1:18:03.258
<i>If you live in a country
If you were born there</i>

1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:06.059
<i>If this is your country</i>

1:18:06.226 --> 1:18:08.257
<i>It is reflected in your eyes</i>

1:18:08.330 --> 1:18:10.745
<i>On your skin
On your hands</i>

1:18:10.940 --> 1:18:13.226
<i>In the mane of her trees</i>

1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:15.359
<i>In the flesh of her earth</i>

1:18:15.470 --> 1:18:17.484
<i>In your bones are her stones</i>

1:18:17.658 --> 1:18:19.813
<i>In your blood are her rivers</i>

1:18:19.958 --> 1:18:22.677
<i>In you is her sky, her taste,</i>

1:18:23.370 --> 1:18:25.727
<i>In her men and her women</i>

1:18:41.582 --> 1:18:42.783
Let me.

1:18:42.912 --> 1:18:44.729
Ana, back off.

1:18:45.300 --> 1:18:47.300
Come on, get out.

1:18:51.446 --> 1:18:54.740
That's right, be careful.

1:18:56.355 --> 1:19:00.239
Found her on the outskirts of Bukava. Stumbled
upon her by chance on my way out of town.

1:19:05.257 --> 1:19:06.771
Thanks.

1:19:11.494 --> 1:19:15.174
Prothé, go make something to eat.
Ana, help Prothé.

1:19:17.260 --> 1:19:20.057
Gaby, sit with your mother.
I'll be right back.

1:19:30.569 --> 1:19:35.299
Bukabu has always been a hellhole, but
you won't believe what's happening there now.

1:19:35.489 --> 1:19:40.188
On the streets, you will find 100,000 people.
There is not even a vacant sidewalk.

1:19:42.832 --> 1:19:45.142
Did she tell you anything?

1:19:45.736 --> 1:19:48.011
No, she was silent the whole way.

1:19:57.149 --> 1:20:00.361
Gaby, turn on the lights
on the terrace, please.

1:20:01.228 --> 1:20:03.228
Give Mom a kiss.

1:20:11.677 --> 1:20:13.678
Good night, Mom.

1:20:16.117 --> 1:20:18.117
Good night, Mom.

1:20:38.588 --> 1:20:40.588
You're not sleeping?

1:20:41.271 --> 1:20:42.975
Do you hear me?

1:21:35.749 --> 1:21:37.967
Forgive me.

1:21:44.730 --> 1:21:48.034
Gaby, hurry up!
Ana, sweety, let's go.

1:21:48.114 --> 1:21:50.394
- Where is Mom?
- Mom is sleeping.

1:21:51.090 --> 1:21:53.739
- I caught you!
- Where are you going?!

1:21:55.754 --> 1:21:57.554
Goodbye, Mom.

1:21:57.737 --> 1:21:59.334
Hurry up!

1:21:59.969 --> 1:22:01.840
I'm coming!

1:22:17.908 --> 1:22:20.301
Hey, come here, Gaby!
This is Gaby!

1:22:20.504 --> 1:22:22.505
Let's go.

1:22:25.980 --> 1:22:26.980
What is this?

1:22:27.087 --> 1:22:29.779
- The newspaper of Rwandan assassins.
- Read us.

1:22:30.441 --> 1:22:34.847
"Hutu, remember:
Tutsis are liars and traitors."

1:22:35.056 --> 1:22:37.933
"Hutus should not show mercy to them."

1:22:38.083 --> 1:22:40.033
- Bullshit.
- I have an idea.

1:22:40.186 --> 1:22:42.776
Whoever gets three hits on the title,
will get a beer.

1:22:42.876 --> 1:22:44.230
No, I'm going home.

1:22:44.347 --> 1:22:48.245
Stop it, wait!
Francis, show him. Watch.

1:23:00.714 --> 1:23:03.133
- Come on, Gaby, try it!
- No.

1:23:03.643 --> 1:23:06.073
- At least once.
- No.

1:23:19.996 --> 1:23:21.689
Hi, Mom.

1:24:00.043 --> 1:24:02.270
Do you remember your cousins?

1:24:04.695 --> 1:24:07.030
Yes, of course I remember them.

1:24:12.049 --> 1:24:14.456
They were killed three months ago.

1:24:16.653 --> 1:24:20.456
Do you know what bodies look like
three months after death?

1:24:25.703 --> 1:24:27.703
There is nothing left of the body.

1:24:27.804 --> 1:24:29.804
Just rot and stench.

1:24:32.418 --> 1:24:36.013
I tried to pick them up,
but they slipped between my fingers.

1:24:43.309 --> 1:24:45.724
There were four stains on the floor.

1:24:46.779 --> 1:24:50.024
I tried my best to clean them off.

1:24:51.496 --> 1:24:53.576
I scraped the floor with my nails...

1:24:53.702 --> 1:24:56.816
but their blood was soaked into the concrete.

1:25:28.748 --> 1:25:30.269
Gaby...

1:25:30.385 --> 1:25:33.668
promise me that you
will always be with me.

1:25:33.775 --> 1:25:35.248
But I am with you.

1:25:35.420 --> 1:25:37.641
Yes, but promise me.

1:25:38.186 --> 1:25:40.452
I promise you, Ana.

1:25:47.116 --> 1:25:50.130
- Good morning, Gaby, how are you?
- Normal.

1:25:50.963 --> 1:25:53.683
Help me get Mom to the bedroom.

1:25:56.375 --> 1:25:57.841
Let's go, Yvonne.

1:25:57.978 --> 1:25:59.745
Let's get you up.

1:25:59.962 --> 1:26:02.284
That's right, darling.

1:26:17.445 --> 1:26:19.445
Well, shall we go?

1:26:32.936 --> 1:26:34.936
Help me.

1:26:50.330 --> 1:26:52.530
Please don't betray me.

1:27:04.891 --> 1:27:07.309
Hey, you! Did you see a boy
with a yellow t-shirt?

1:27:07.691 --> 1:27:09.984
You and you!
Search the house.

1:27:10.147 --> 1:27:14.590
On your knees!
On your knees, I said! Now!

1:27:15.105 --> 1:27:16.693
Where's your master?
Answer quickly!

1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:20.722
- He went north.
- Where?! Why did he go?

1:27:20.825 --> 1:27:23.029
Answer!
And what are you doing here?

1:27:23.225 --> 1:27:25.505
He left for work,
and you burned down my house.

1:27:25.630 --> 1:27:27.409
Why did you stay here?

1:27:27.450 --> 1:27:29.289
- There are no Hutus here!
- He's not here.

1:27:29.330 --> 1:27:31.079
I'm giving you a week.

1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:34.079
If you haven't left in a week,
I'll kill you, got it?

1:27:35.148 --> 1:27:36.200
And you,

1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:38.767
tell your father
that the French are not welcome in Burundi.

1:27:38.859 --> 1:27:41.009
Do you understand?
That's it, let's go.

1:27:41.758 --> 1:27:44.969
We're going to the next house!
Maybe the boy is there.

1:27:46.952 --> 1:27:49.818
Divide into groups
and check everywhere!

1:27:50.185 --> 1:27:54.059
He couldn't have gone far.
Why are you standing there? I said, quickly!

1:28:00.359 --> 1:28:01.733
This way.

1:28:02.213 --> 1:28:04.679
Thank you so much.
God bless you.

1:28:30.029 --> 1:28:32.155
Give your mom a kiss and go to bed.

1:28:36.702 --> 1:28:38.702
Good night, Mom.

1:28:40.891 --> 1:28:43.678
Ana? What do you want?

1:29:06.294 --> 1:29:07.775
What are you doing?

1:29:08.090 --> 1:29:09.162
Get up.

1:29:09.349 --> 1:29:11.529
You want to forget your cousins?

1:29:12.624 --> 1:29:13.930
Sing for them.

1:29:16.023 --> 1:29:17.316
Come on, sing for them!

1:29:17.727 --> 1:29:18.783
Okay.

- Come on, sing! And why are you interfering?

1:30:33.470 --> 1:30:36.639
You're a dirty Frenchman like your father!
He left us to die there.

1:30:36.884 --> 1:30:41.455
- Sing, sing! I told you to sing!
- Yvonne, stop it!

1:30:41.538 --> 1:30:43.758
- Sing!
- Let her go, let her go!

1:30:43.923 --> 1:30:49.559

Yvonne, let her go! Let her go!

1:30:49.699 --> 1:30:51.609
Don't be afraid, darling.

1:30:53.288 --> 1:30:54.989
- Ana!
- Ana!

1:31:10.719 --> 1:31:13.690
Listen, my little daughter is injured.

1:31:13.789 --> 1:31:16.230
- I'm driving her to the hospital.
- Get out of the car!

1:31:16.326 --> 1:31:18.550
Get out! You know the rules!

1:31:18.693 --> 1:31:20.963
You have already seen me.
Don't you remember?

1:31:23.146 --> 1:31:25.229
Here, look!

1:31:25.418 --> 1:31:28.109
Look. I will pay you.
I have money!

1:31:28.150 --> 1:31:31.859
You know what you did in Rwanda?
You know?

1:31:32.289 --> 1:31:34.367
- My daughter is injured.
- I don't care.

1:31:34.464 --> 1:31:37.997
Let me through!
I urgently need to go to the hospital!

1:31:46.750 --> 1:31:50.009
Pull back!
Let me pass. Step back.

1:32:12.040 --> 1:32:14.180
Everything's fine.
She has no fracture.

1:32:14.340 --> 1:32:17.079
If she gets a headache,
give her a paracetamol.

1:32:17.214 --> 1:32:20.347
And in three weeks,
you can remove the stitches for her yourself.

1:32:20.504 --> 1:32:22.574
- Thank you, doctor.
- All the best.

1:32:24.677 --> 1:32:26.777
Dad, we have to go back to Mom.

1:32:26.893 --> 1:32:29.710
No, it's too dangerous.
We'll spend the night here.

1:32:57.967 --> 1:33:01.141
- Prothé, have you seen Yvonne?
- No, I haven't seen her.

1:33:01.990 --> 1:33:03.990
Mom!

1:33:11.295 --> 1:33:13.035
<i>Monsieur</i>!
<i>Monsieur.</i>

1:33:13.163 --> 1:33:16.969
- Have you seen my mother?
- No, I haven't seen her.

1:33:19.499 --> 1:33:21.599
- She's not here.
- All right, let's go.

1:33:22.291 --> 1:33:24.015
- Good day.
- Hello.

1:33:29.400 --> 1:33:32.055
Gaby!
Ana, let's go.

1:33:34.671 --> 1:33:36.414
Mom is not here.

1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:26.733
Yes, we've already reported her disappearance
to the police and the embassy.

1:34:30.215 --> 1:34:33.009
- I called all the hospitals. Nothing.
- Gaby, let's go, quick.

1:34:33.149 --> 1:34:37.049
- There's been trouble. Hurry up.
- None of the neighbors have seen her.

1:34:47.482 --> 1:34:50.597
Look what the dirty Hutus have done!
They killed his father!

1:34:50.704 --> 1:34:52.705
- Do you see, Gaby?
- Armand?

1:34:53.056 --> 1:34:58.609
The Hutus slaughtered his father in the
middle of the street. Right next to our houses!

1:34:59.793 --> 1:35:02.625
Damn it!
They impersonated vegetable traders,

1:35:02.702 --> 1:35:04.869
and when he
came to buy something...

1:35:04.911 --> 1:35:08.455
Armand, is that true?
Armand?

1:35:10.538 --> 1:35:11.936
Armand?

1:35:15.133 --> 1:35:16.999
Let's go, they are waiting for us!
Hurry!

1:35:17.086 --> 1:35:18.669
Armand, let's go.

1:35:19.884 --> 1:35:21.460
Let's go.

1:35:30.810 --> 1:35:32.713
We looked everywhere for him.

1:35:32.801 --> 1:35:35.087
The boys rummaged the whole area.

1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:40.593
The boys did a really good job.

1:35:40.780 --> 1:35:43.267
- Clapton, hello.
- Who are these white children?

1:35:43.349 --> 1:35:46.593
Everything is fine.
Their mother is Tutsi.

1:35:50.347 --> 1:35:53.395
Are you the son of the murdered ambassador?

1:35:55.734 --> 1:35:57.522
- We're going to the beach.
- Yes, boss.

1:35:57.607 --> 1:36:01.291
- They've already found your father's killer.
- Let's go.

1:36:48.645 --> 1:36:50.390
Quiet! Quiet!

1:36:50.471 --> 1:36:53.059
Shut up! Don't shout!

1:36:53.140 --> 1:36:56.099
Silence! It's the Hutu who
killed your father.

1:36:56.141 --> 1:36:58.479
- Don't.
- Come on, beat him!

1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:00.649
- No.
- Come on, Armand.

1:37:01.210 --> 1:37:03.502
What are you waiting for?
Come on!

1:37:03.636 --> 1:37:05.739
Beat him, come on!

1:37:06.278 --> 1:37:09.619
It wasn't me!
I swear it wasn't me!

1:37:10.700 --> 1:37:13.249
Shut up!
Beat him!

1:37:35.846 --> 1:37:37.354
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:37:37.436 --> 1:37:39.653
- Hello, boss.
- What is going on here?

1:37:39.750 --> 1:37:42.479
- We found the ambassador's killer.
- Where is that trash?

1:37:56.440 --> 1:37:59.073
Tie him up and
get him in the car.

1:38:00.353 --> 1:38:03.553
No.
Don't!

1:38:04.331 --> 1:38:07.002
Bastard, that's how you like it!

1:38:40.191 --> 1:38:43.039
Gaby, listen.
Avenge your friend.

1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:46.075
It's time to choose.
The French or the Tutsis?

1:38:46.195 --> 1:38:48.879
The Tutsis or the French??
Who are you with?

1:38:50.694 --> 1:38:53.380
Come on, Gaby!
Revenge for Armand!

1:38:53.642 --> 1:38:55.179
Come on.

1:40:48.586 --> 1:40:50.818
I've decided you cannot stay here.

1:40:50.921 --> 1:40:54.649
I will send you to France
to your grandparents.

1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:58.892
- Will you come, too?
- No, I'm going to stay and look for Mom.

1:40:59.612 --> 1:41:01.767
Do you still love her?

1:41:02.010 --> 1:41:04.135
Yes, I love her, darling.

1:41:17.221 --> 1:41:18.714
Armand!

1:41:19.250 --> 1:41:22.875
Who do I see, Gaby!
God, you have changed.

1:41:23.022 --> 1:41:25.482
BUJUMBURA - PRESENT DAY

1:41:25.624 --> 1:41:27.659
- How are you?
- Me? Excellent.

1:41:27.762 --> 1:41:30.245
- And what is this?
- Don't do that!

1:41:30.803 --> 1:41:32.804
Let me help you.

1:41:33.252 --> 1:41:37.180
Well, are we going there right away?
The workers will come in an hour.

1:41:37.298 --> 1:41:39.429
- Yes, if you don't mind.
- Let's go.

1:41:53.432 --> 1:41:56.005
- Did you put the picture there?
- My mother.

1:41:56.443 --> 1:42:00.212
You wanted to see her
when you come back.

1:42:11.772 --> 1:42:14.679
- Good day.
- Hello.

1:42:15.460 --> 1:42:17.813
Where will the road go?

1:42:18.013 --> 1:42:21.727
To those stakes.
These graves must be moved.

1:42:22.331 --> 1:42:23.565
Must be hard
for the families.

1:42:23.624 --> 1:42:26.090
- Yes, poor people...
- They will experience everything again.

1:42:26.178 --> 1:42:28.637
The grave is there.

1:42:28.777 --> 1:42:31.830
- You can access it there.
- Understood.

1:42:32.501 --> 1:42:36.328
On top of that, the municipality requires
them to pay for the exhumation.

1:42:36.462 --> 1:42:37.943
And it costs a fortune!

1:42:38.049 --> 1:42:41.016
- What happened to the documents?
- Don't worry, I took care of everything.

1:42:41.096 --> 1:42:43.457
I took a plot of land
near the Church of the Holy Family.

1:42:43.577 --> 1:42:46.119
- Your father will rest in peace.
- Thanks.

1:42:46.584 --> 1:42:48.243
Careful, careful.

1:43:35.980 --> 1:43:37.759
Where did you find him?

1:43:37.905 --> 1:43:39.353
Right here.

1:43:39.576 --> 1:43:41.866
And Prothé was there.

1:43:42.643 --> 1:43:46.562
Your father tried to save him,
but two against ten...

1:43:47.232 --> 1:43:49.232
- There?
- Yes.

1:43:55.632 --> 1:43:59.445
Do you remember how we danced to this song?

1:43:59.534 --> 1:44:03.359
- Lucien!
- Yes, Lucian liked to do it.

1:44:03.400 --> 1:44:05.515
- Yes, yes, exactly...
- Exactly.

1:44:05.641 --> 1:44:09.821
He always forgot how
to pronounce words...

1:44:11.886 --> 1:44:14.419
- Do you know anything about Gino?
- No.

1:44:14.460 --> 1:44:17.129
He went to Belgium
and I haven't heard from him since.

1:44:17.522 --> 1:44:20.129
- Nothing at all?
- He hasn't contacted me.

1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:23.759
Gabby, you should know something...

1:44:24.398 --> 1:44:26.046
about your mother.

1:44:26.284 --> 1:44:28.153
I don't know how to tell you.

1:44:28.342 --> 1:44:31.638
That day, I didn't have
the courage to tell you.

1:45:07.776 --> 1:45:10.896
<i>Christiane, where are you?</i>

1:45:12.917 --> 1:45:17.158
<i>Where are you, children?</i>

1:45:19.067 --> 1:45:23.269
<i>Christiane, where are you?</i>

1:45:24.234 --> 1:45:28.446
<i>Christiane, where are you?</i>

1:45:28.793 --> 1:45:32.853
<i>Where are you, children?</i>

1:45:35.345 --> 1:45:39.085
<i>Christiane, where are you?</i>

1:45:39.791 --> 1:45:43.197
<i>Christiane, where are you?</i>

1:45:46.549 --> 1:45:50.184
<i>Where are you, children?</i>

1:45:58.932 --> 1:46:00.946
<i>Mom, it's me, Gabriel.</i>

1:46:05.753 --> 1:46:07.407
<i>Christiane?</i>

1:46:19.585 --> 1:46:21.332
<i>Christiane.</i>

1:46:21.763 --> 1:46:25.885
<i>Christiane, where are you?</i>

1:46:28.618 --> 1:46:32.646
<i>Christiane, where are you?</i>

1:46:34.216 --> 1:46:39.439
<i>Where are you, children?</i>

1:46:40.028 --> 1:46:42.498
<i>Christiane, where are you?</i>

1:46:42.625 --> 1:46:43.957
<i>Ana...</i>

1:46:44.391 --> 1:46:46.514
<i>Mom is here.</i>

1:46:47.243 --> 1:46:50.203
<i>All the years we've been looking for her,
and three months ago...</i>

1:46:50.309 --> 1:46:52.504
<i>she returned to our old house
and lived there.</i>

1:46:52.634 --> 1:46:57.179
<i>I will stay in Bujumbura to take care of her.
I will wait for her condition to improve.</i>

1:46:57.592 --> 1:47:00.209
<i>Try to get here when you can.</i>
