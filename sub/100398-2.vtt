00:06.549 --> 00:08.926
Previously on
Star Trek: Picard...

00:09.009 --> 00:11.804
A group of rogue synthetics
dropped the planetary defense shields,

00:11.887 --> 00:14.265
completely destroying
the Utopia Planitia shipyard.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.017
Tell us, Admiral.
Why did you really quit Starfleet?

00:17.101 --> 00:19.562
Because it was no longer Starfleet!

00:20.229 --> 00:21.397
We're done here.

00:22.106 --> 00:23.733
-What's happening?
-Baby, please.

00:23.816 --> 00:26.318
Find Picard. He can help you.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.238
-What do you want here?
-I was with my boyfriend.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.032
They murdered him.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.409
No, no, no!

00:33.492 --> 00:35.536
Something inside of me
just knew what to do,

00:35.619 --> 00:37.496
how to move, how to fight.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.585
Everything inside of me
says that I'm safe with you.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.629
I had a dear friend. Commander Data.

00:45.713 --> 00:49.508
He painted you exactly as you are
here and now.

00:49.592 --> 00:50.676
That's impossible.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.053
He named the painting Daughter.

00:53.137 --> 00:54.263
Stay down.

00:55.431 --> 00:58.392
She came here to find safety.

01:02.938 --> 01:03.939
No!

01:05.483 --> 01:09.111
I owe it to her
to find out who killed her and why.

01:09.195 --> 01:12.072
The androids that destroyed Mars
came from this lab.

01:12.156 --> 01:15.701
No one has ever been able to redevelop
the science used to create Data.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.411
Then came Bruce Maddox.

01:17.495 --> 01:20.456
His theory was that
Data's entire code, even his memories,

01:20.539 --> 01:23.501
could be reconstituted
from a single positronic neuron.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.545
Then Data, or some part of him,
would be alive.

01:26.629 --> 01:28.672
There'd be no way of knowing
without examining--

01:28.756 --> 01:31.050
Dahj. Data's daughter.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.468
They're created in pairs.

01:32.551 --> 01:33.552
Dr. Asha.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.055
-Narek.
-Soji.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.598
-Twins?
-Twins.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.476
So there's another one.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.657
Attention, all personnel.
Happy First Contact Day.

01:55.825 --> 01:59.328
Celebrations will be held
in designated recreational areas

01:59.411 --> 02:02.706
during regularly scheduled
alpha and beta shift breaks.

02:03.749 --> 02:07.920
All directors, please submit
final duty log prior to shift change.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.673
Sector three
maintenance regulators will report

02:10.756 --> 02:12.216
to mandatory security training

02:12.299 --> 02:13.884
at 0800 hours.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.053
Good morning, plastic people.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.681
Good morning, Mr. Pincus.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.683
Let's go to work.

02:23.894 --> 02:28.816
A500 maintenance issues should be reported
to synthetic personnel supervisors

02:28.899 --> 02:31.819
prior to initiating
manual shutdown procedures.

02:34.905 --> 02:38.868
Every other tri-hy station
in the yard gets off First Contact Day.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.412
Not us. What did we do wrong?

02:41.495 --> 02:44.248
To have a skeleton crew,
you have to have skeletons.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.667
I bet my kids are having cake on Earth.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.461
Yo, F8.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.548
-You get into any trouble last night?
-Hell, yeah.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.924
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

02:54.550 --> 02:55.551
Nothing.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.344
Hell, yeah.

02:57.428 --> 02:58.679
Hell, yeah.

02:59.263 --> 03:00.890
Hey, F8, I got one for you.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.933
What's brown and sticky?

03:03.893 --> 03:06.395
Teratogenic coolant. Isonucleic residue.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.980
Boson-enriched nanopolymer.

03:08.731 --> 03:09.732
A stick.

03:11.567 --> 03:12.651
You get it?

03:13.485 --> 03:14.486
No.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.868
Dude creeps me out.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.912
Hey. He can hear you.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.496
And?

03:24.580 --> 03:27.207
You can't offend them. They're not people.

03:27.291 --> 03:30.711
And they can rip through
solid titanium without breaking a sweat.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.922
What are you, his sister?

03:33.005 --> 03:34.298
Who raised you?

03:47.227 --> 03:50.564
I wish they'd go back to using
uno amino matrices in the replicators.

03:50.648 --> 03:51.649
No kidding.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.943
Space pineapples again.

03:55.361 --> 03:57.404
I know what's brown and sticky.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.991
This food is brown and sticky.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.912
Hey, that dude is lucky
he doesn't have to eat this crap.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.872
Now, here is some brown sticky shit.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.292
Do you replicate flies with that too?

04:16.882 --> 04:18.050
What are you doing?

04:18.592 --> 04:19.802
Security alert.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.221
Multiple synthetic labor units
have been compromised.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.389
Get away from there!

04:23.472 --> 04:27.351
Deflector shields down
in all sectors of Utopia Planitia.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.103
-Repeat, security alert.
-Shit!

04:29.603 --> 04:30.646
Multiple synthetic--

04:38.904 --> 04:41.448
Central, this is tri-hy station A19.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.617
Synth unit F8 has been compromised.

04:43.701 --> 04:44.827
We have a man down.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.870
Repeat, we have a man down.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.875
Stand down!

04:54.378 --> 04:56.463
Grid failure detected.

04:56.547 --> 04:59.258
Move immediately to designated safe zones.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.594
Security grid failure in progress.

05:03.429 --> 05:06.890
Containments have failed.
Evacuate immediately.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.435
Orbital defense system compromised.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.105
Emergency evacuation protocol in effect.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.233
Cascade failure in progress.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.186
Surface scans negative.

07:16.270 --> 07:20.816
No matter or trace elements
consistent with Dahj Asha are present.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.151
They erased her.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.653
And then they erased themselves.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.406
Well, it's certainly
Tal Shiar's operational style, but--

07:27.489 --> 07:28.490
On Earth?

07:28.574 --> 07:30.742
Not even the Tal Shiar
would have that audacity.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.077
Then who?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.122
It has to be.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.790
Zhat Vash.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.209
And here we go.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.128
What is "Zhat Vash"?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.671
A Tal Shiar myth.

07:43.714 --> 07:46.300
It's a kind of bogeyman
they use to frighten new recruits.

07:46.675 --> 07:47.885
And children.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.720
Please explain.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.597
Here in the Federation,

07:51.680 --> 07:54.766
you refer to the Tal Shiar
as the Romulan secret police.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.561
But it's a bit redundant.

07:57.644 --> 08:01.481
You could put the word "secret" in front
of almost any aspect of Romulan culture.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.151
I have heard,
and I have reason to believe,

08:04.234 --> 08:08.614
that the Tal Shiar is merely a mask
worn by another far older cabal,

08:08.697 --> 08:12.701
that before the Tal Shiar,
there was the Zhat Vash.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.540
"Zhat Vash" is a term
sometimes used to refer to the dead,

08:18.624 --> 08:21.001
the only reliable keepers of secrets.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.003
-Ominous.
- No. Fitting.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.881
Because that's the sole purpose
of the Zhat Vash...

08:28.550 --> 08:31.678
to keep a secret so profound and terrible,

08:31.762 --> 08:34.264
just learning it
can break a person's mind.

08:40.896 --> 08:44.900
Are you sure she said that he was murdered
here, in her apartment?

08:44.983 --> 08:46.235
She did.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.322
All apparent evidence to the contrary.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.075
Would it be foolish to ask
what is the dread secret

08:53.158 --> 08:54.826
that the Zhat Vash are keeping?

08:54.910 --> 08:57.329
No one outside the Zhat Vash
knows for sure.

08:57.913 --> 08:58.997
But I've heard whispers.

08:59.623 --> 09:03.210
Romulan methods
of forensic molecular reconstruction

09:03.293 --> 09:05.087
are illegal in the Federation.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.672
Really? I had no idea.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.632
Yeah. They're also unreliable.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.302
And the results are dubious, at best.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.972
Yeah. That's exactly what
we wanted you to think.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.890
When I was a new recruit,

09:16.974 --> 09:18.934
-one of my first handlers...
-My mother.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.520
-...got drunk on Romulan ale...
-My father.

09:21.603 --> 09:25.315
...and let slip that at the heart
of the Zhat Vash mission

09:25.399 --> 09:28.235
was a deep unassuageable loathing.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.903
Loathing of whom?

09:30.487 --> 09:32.698
Not whom. What.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.673
-More wine?
-Surprise me.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.767
Dahj, your replicator menus are tragic.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.731
It's extraordinary.

10:06.690 --> 10:10.402
It's said they operate
without regard for treaty or jurisdiction,

10:10.485 --> 10:12.571
and not just in Romulan worlds,

10:12.654 --> 10:14.990
but in the Klingon empire,
the Gorn hegemony,

10:15.073 --> 10:16.575
even the Federation itself,

10:16.658 --> 10:21.079
and that they have kept this secret
for thousands upon thousands of years.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.789
Cheeky fuckers.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.417
They've overwritten the particle residuum.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.752
Overwritten it?

10:26.835 --> 10:29.087
Yes, and in a very sophisticated way.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.214
It's barely detectable.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.592
It would read as instrument failure
if you didn't know better.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.136
But it's not. It's a flat-out wipe.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.846
Can you recover it?

10:39.931 --> 10:42.309
Have you never noticed
the complete absence

10:42.392 --> 10:45.187
of any form of artificial life
in Romulan culture?

10:45.270 --> 10:48.857
We don't have androids or AIs.
We don't study cybernetics.

10:48.940 --> 10:52.444
Our computers are limited
to purely numerical functions.

10:52.527 --> 10:55.572
They must've saturated this place
in antileptons.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.158
At no small risk to themselves,
by the way.

10:58.909 --> 11:03.080
This place hasn't just been cleaned,
Admiral. It's been scrubbed.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.375
Is that to be expected of your Zhat Vash?

11:06.458 --> 11:09.878
They're not my Zhat Vash.
And I thought you didn't believe in them.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.714
I may be coming around.

11:13.965 --> 11:20.263
So, then all this is about
the Zhat Vash's hatred of androids?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.224
It's not simply hate.

11:22.307 --> 11:28.730
It's hate and fear and pure loathing
for any form of synthetic life.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.440
Why?

11:30.524 --> 11:32.609
That I can't tell you. I don't know.

11:33.318 --> 11:38.323
But I am certain that is the silence
that seals the mouths of the Zhat Vash

11:38.407 --> 11:40.909
as surely and eternally as death.

11:40.992 --> 11:43.703
The operatives who did this wouldn't have
wanted to leave the impression

11:43.787 --> 11:45.288
that the place had been scrubbed.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.875
We may find they've neglected something,

11:48.959 --> 11:55.048
some actual clue that lay tucked inside
a false clue, as it were.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.760
Something like this, for example?

12:06.435 --> 12:10.188
There's no record
of any incoming or outgoing calls.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.982
The information's there,

12:12.065 --> 12:14.568
but the indexes
have been surgically deleted.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.361
There's no way to sort the data.

12:16.445 --> 12:21.575
Essentially, they've sterilized it
so that it's qualitatively agnostic.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.744
There's no distinction.
Everything looks like everything else.

12:24.828 --> 12:29.833
All we need is a record of any contact
that she may have had with her sister.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.293
And no doubt it's in here,

12:31.376 --> 12:33.712
but it will look
the same as everything else.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.427
No, it'll look like her.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.471
Like Dahj.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.556
What's her name? Dr. Jurati.

12:44.639 --> 12:47.267
She said that
they would be identical twins, right?

12:47.350 --> 12:50.061
-Even closer than twins, perhaps.
-Okay.

12:50.145 --> 12:53.398
So what's the first thing you do when
you bring a new digital assistant online?

12:53.482 --> 12:55.066
-Introduce myself.
-Exactly.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.235
Computers like efficiency.

12:57.319 --> 13:00.363
So what a computer does
is build heuristics,

13:00.447 --> 13:03.158
shortcuts to the tasks
it performs most often.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.744
You're saying that
if they were indistinguishable,

13:05.827 --> 13:09.789
then the machine, at some point,
could've mistaken the sister for Dahj.

13:09.873 --> 13:10.874
Exactly.

13:10.957 --> 13:14.377
And if it did, even for a few seconds
before it flagged the error,

13:14.461 --> 13:17.422
then the tags might still be in here,

13:17.506 --> 13:20.842
overlooked by even
the most diligent of scrubbers.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.345
Got you.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.680
Okay.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.974
These were all outgoing.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.479
These were incoming.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.733
It's her.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.028
Ghosts in the machine.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.240
Can you tell me where she is?

13:44.074 --> 13:45.200
No.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.619
But I can tell you where she isn't.

13:47.702 --> 13:52.832
Nonlocal information packets
are routed through subspace relays.

13:52.916 --> 13:57.087
This routing leaves
tiny but unmistakable code marks.

13:57.629 --> 13:58.922
Nonlocal?

13:59.005 --> 14:02.092
I am saying
this transmission came from off-world.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.138
Are you certain?

14:07.222 --> 14:09.808
Wherever this girl was calling
her sister from,

14:10.267 --> 14:12.102
it's nowhere on Earth.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.238
Beautiful?

14:25.031 --> 14:27.826
No one's ever said that before
about a Borg cube.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.582
This isn't the Borg cube, Narek.
It's the Artifact.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.128
The Borg cube is mighty and omnipotent.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.427
The Artifact is lost...

14:47.512 --> 14:49.139
severed from the Collective...

14:50.348 --> 14:52.475
broken, vulnerable.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.730
You find vulnerability
and brokenness beautiful?

14:57.480 --> 15:00.900
Is that strange,
to find beauty in imperfection?

15:01.860 --> 15:03.445
Certainly not very Romulan.

15:04.237 --> 15:08.033
But then, there's nothing very Romulan
about this place at all.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.909
Apart from the current owners

15:10.619 --> 15:15.040
and the profits you extract
from the exploitation of Borg technology.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.875
Are you a subversive, Dr. Asha,

15:16.958 --> 15:20.587
sent by our enemies to foment revolution
among the researchers?

15:20.670 --> 15:21.921
Yes, I am.

15:22.631 --> 15:25.842
But it's too late now.
You already slept with me.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.595
That makes you an accessory to my plot.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.182
Clearly...

15:34.142 --> 15:36.102
I'll have to silence you.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.445
Try it.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.585
Time for work.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.713
Yeah. Me too.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.925
Oh, you have a job? Thought you were
just some Romulan lounge lizard.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.551
Oh, we all have our part to play.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.013
Can I ask you a question?

16:12.097 --> 16:14.808
Sure. Just don't expect an answer.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.186
Are we allowed to be sleeping together,
or is that a secret?

16:19.187 --> 16:20.730
Very much the latter.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.317
Is everything Romulans do a secret?

16:24.401 --> 16:26.861
Oh, I'm not at liberty to divulge that.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.988
Is your name actually Narek?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.657
It's one of them.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.619
So, is there anything
you can tell me about yourself?

16:35.537 --> 16:36.538
Yes.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.750
I'm a very private person.

16:44.212 --> 16:48.049
So, see you at the checkpoint?

16:48.133 --> 16:50.927
-Oh, really?
-I need to see how it works.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.681
In your new capacity as?

16:55.265 --> 16:57.475
Can you keep a secret?

16:58.226 --> 16:59.227
Yes.

16:59.936 --> 17:00.937
Good.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.694
So can I.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.211
He said I'd find you out here.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.797
-Moritz.
-Hello, Jean-Luc.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.513
It's been a very long time.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.265
Too long.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.852
I know there was a bit of trouble
with the remote med-scan,

17:40.935 --> 17:43.271
but I hardly expected a house call.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.106
Let me just...

17:45.857 --> 17:47.108
Your office told me

17:47.192 --> 17:51.321
they would be forwarding
the certificate for interstellar service

17:51.404 --> 17:53.490
as soon as you had seen the results.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.288
Oh, I see.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.624
You might want something stronger.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.381
Your med-scan came in

18:10.465 --> 18:13.927
at or above Starfleet minimums
in every category.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.721
Cardiovascular. Metabolic. Cognitive.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.182
For a relic, you're in excellent shape.

18:20.141 --> 18:24.395
Just that little abnormality
in the parietal lobe.

18:24.813 --> 18:31.402
I was told a long time ago
that it might cause a problem eventually.

18:31.486 --> 18:35.365
Loss of appetite,
mood swings, unsettling dreams?

18:38.076 --> 18:43.331
Inappropriate displays of anger
on interplanetary news holos.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.794
What do you think it is?

18:47.877 --> 18:50.255
I'd need to run more tests.

18:50.338 --> 18:53.383
It could be one of a number
of related syndromes.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.801
Prognosis?

18:57.971 --> 19:01.599
Come on. Let's have it, Dr. Benayoun.

19:03.434 --> 19:07.647
A few are treatable,
but they all end the same way...

19:08.815 --> 19:10.358
some sooner than others.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.237
I see.

19:23.955 --> 19:28.877
I need you to certify me to Starfleet

19:28.960 --> 19:31.754
as fit for interstellar service.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.592
Now, will you do it?

19:37.552 --> 19:40.096
I don't suppose
you'd condescend to tell me why?

19:42.307 --> 19:43.641
Secret mission?

19:44.267 --> 19:47.270
We certainly had our share of those
on the Stargazer, didn't we?

19:47.937 --> 19:50.231
Remember that time
in the fire forest on Calyx--

19:50.315 --> 19:52.233
Dr. Benayoun.

19:52.317 --> 19:53.526
Forgive me.

19:55.069 --> 19:59.574
You really want to go
back out into the cold, knowing?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.703
More than ever, knowing.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.128
I don't know what kind of trouble
you're planning to get into.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.422
Maybe if you're lucky,

20:15.256 --> 20:16.883
it will kill you first.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.002
All visitors
must report to main security desk.

20:53.086 --> 20:56.089
All visitors must report
to main security desk.

21:00.051 --> 21:02.136
Admiral Kurti,
please report to conference room B.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.974
Admiral Kurti, please report
to conference room B.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.058
Hello.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.396
I have a meeting with the CNC.
I have an appointment.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.480
Of course, sir.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.276
May I have your name, please, sir?

21:18.152 --> 21:20.822
Oh, um... Picard.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.825
P-I-C-A-R-D.

21:23.908 --> 21:24.909
Jean-Luc.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.661
Ah.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.705
It's nice to see you
up and around, Admiral.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.831
Welcome back.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.335
-Come.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.631
Jean-Luc.

21:38.715 --> 21:39.799
Kirsten.

21:40.925 --> 21:41.926
Hello.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.511
May I?

21:46.889 --> 21:49.851
Apparently you have
urgent Federation business.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.437
I understood you
to have left affairs of state behind.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.815
I am staying as far from it all as I can.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.443
-So, then what can I do for you?
-Bruce Maddox.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.610
What about him?

21:59.694 --> 22:05.783
I believe that he is using neurons
from the late Commander Data

22:05.867 --> 22:08.911
to create a new organic synthetic.

22:10.038 --> 22:12.623
Well, that's not far from all of it.
It is all of it.

22:12.707 --> 22:14.876
The Romulans are involved.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.419
This gets better and better.

22:16.502 --> 22:20.673
Commander Data was not only my colleague,
he was my dear friend.

22:21.299 --> 22:25.470
And he gave his life,
body and soul to the Federation.

22:25.553 --> 22:30.725
And if there is a chance
that some part of him still exists,

22:31.267 --> 22:34.103
then I think we have
an obligation to investigate--

22:34.187 --> 22:36.105
There is no "we," Jean-Luc.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.190
Kirsten.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.818
I know we have not always seen eye-to-eye.

22:40.902 --> 22:43.488
Nevertheless, I have a request to make.

22:43.571 --> 22:47.658
Based on my years of service,
I want you to reinstate me,

22:48.326 --> 22:51.079
temporarily, for one mission.

22:51.162 --> 22:56.417
I will need a small warp-capable
reconnaissance ship with a minimal crew.

22:56.501 --> 23:00.296
And if you feel
that my rank makes me too conspicuous,

23:00.379 --> 23:03.925
well, then,
I am content to be demoted to captain.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.472
The sheer fucking hubris.

23:10.098 --> 23:11.682
You think you could waltz back in here

23:11.766 --> 23:14.519
and be entrusted
with taking men and women into space?

23:14.602 --> 23:16.687
Don't you think
I was watching the holo the other day,

23:16.771 --> 23:18.356
along with everyone else in the galaxy?

23:18.439 --> 23:20.191
I should not have spoken in public.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.527
The Romulans were our enemies.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.821
And we tried to help them
for as long as we could.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.698
But even before
the synthetics attacked Mars,

23:27.782 --> 23:30.409
14 species within the Federation said

23:30.493 --> 23:32.787
"Cut the Romulans loose
or we'll pull out."

23:32.870 --> 23:35.957
It was a choice between
allowing the Federation to implode

23:36.040 --> 23:37.333
or letting the Romulans go.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.587
The Federation does not get to decide
if a species lives or dies.

23:41.671 --> 23:43.881
Yes, we do. We absolutely do.

23:44.382 --> 23:48.803
Thousands of other species depend
upon us for unity, for cohesion.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.888
We didn't have enough ships left.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.431
We had to make choices.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.851
But the great Captain Picard
didn't like his orders.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.563
I was standing up for the Federation,
for what it represents,

23:58.646 --> 24:00.982
for what it should still represent!

24:01.065 --> 24:02.942
How dare you lecture me?

24:03.025 --> 24:05.486
Ignore me again at your cost.

24:05.570 --> 24:08.823
-My cost?
-You are in peril, Admiral.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.783
There's no peril here.

24:11.242 --> 24:15.329
Only the pitiable delusions
of a once-great man desperate to matter.

24:15.830 --> 24:18.541
This is no longer your house, Jean-Luc.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.961
So do what you're good at. Go home.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.090
Request denied.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.188
All those entering the Gray Zone

24:40.271 --> 24:42.356
are required to wear protective gear.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.067
Security badges must be visible
at all times.

24:49.197 --> 24:50.698
Here, let me help you with that.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.785
So embarrassing.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.999
Are you new here? Haven't seen you around.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.000
Yesterday.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.586
My residency was supposed
to start six months ago,

25:03.669 --> 25:06.589
but the Romulan Free State
revoked it when I was halfway here.

25:06.672 --> 25:10.384
I have no idea why
or why they finally reinstated it.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.136
Well, that sounds about right.

25:15.348 --> 25:19.268
They still don't have a clear idea
of how much damage this Cube sustained.

25:19.352 --> 25:22.480
Or maybe they do,
and they just aren't telling.

25:23.064 --> 25:26.067
Anyway, you don't want to cross over
into the Gray Zone without this turned on.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.279
Don't worry. You're gonna be fine.

25:37.912 --> 25:40.748
Morning, and welcome to Ops Cycle 9834.

25:40.831 --> 25:41.707
Here we go.

25:42.416 --> 25:45.336
As guests
of the Borg Artifact Research Institute,

25:45.419 --> 25:47.546
your safety is important to us.

25:47.630 --> 25:51.717
You are standing inside one of the most
destructive weapons ever known.

25:51.801 --> 25:55.137
And though no longer active,
it remains potentially dangerous.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.599
Please don't venture outside
of your designated research area.

25:58.975 --> 26:02.812
Assume that any fixture or instrument
not personally known to be benign

26:02.895 --> 26:04.397
is malignant.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.023
Romulans are into drama.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.694
You may not remove any object.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.028
Who is that?

26:11.112 --> 26:13.906
That's Narek. He's new here too.

26:14.865 --> 26:16.826
I didn't know Romulans could be so hot.

26:20.371 --> 26:21.998
Me either.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.165
While in the Gray Zone,

26:23.249 --> 26:27.295
you are likely to encounter
former members of the Borg Collective.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.463
Are you researching the xBs?

26:30.256 --> 26:31.549
It's a little more hands-on.

26:31.632 --> 26:36.554
And if your gradient badge
starts to blink green, run.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.016
Don't worry about it.

26:51.986 --> 26:53.571
Narek, this is--

26:53.654 --> 26:56.574
Dr. Naàshala Kunamadèstifee
of Trill Polytech.

26:56.657 --> 26:59.201
The Institute is eager
to see your work bear fruit, Doctor.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.872
How likely is the Collective
to re-establish a link to your Borg?

27:02.955 --> 27:06.208
Is it really wise to release them?

27:06.292 --> 27:09.045
Well, they're former Borg.
And we're not releasing them.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.172
-We're reclaiming them.
-There's really no danger.

27:11.255 --> 27:13.382
When a Cube undergoes submatrix collapse,

27:13.466 --> 27:16.302
the Collective immediately severs its link
to the afflicted population.

27:16.802 --> 27:20.389
As far as the Collective are concerned,
this is just a graveyard.

27:20.473 --> 27:21.932
And what does that make us?

27:22.016 --> 27:24.101
The same as you find in any graveyard.

27:24.185 --> 27:27.897
Some have come to feed on the dead.
Some are ghosts.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.859
And a few, like you, Dr. Asha,
pin their hopes on resurrection.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.534
May I join you for the procedure?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.204
I'd like to see you work.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.331
That's not up to me.

27:45.414 --> 27:48.667
You need approval from the Director
of the Borg Reclamation Project.

27:49.752 --> 27:52.546
Hmm. Actually, I don't.

28:02.181 --> 28:05.476
Ah, you have a taste for the classics,
I see.

28:07.228 --> 28:10.106
I never really cared for science fiction.

28:10.815 --> 28:13.776
I guess I just didn't get it.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.824
-Well, thank you for coming over.
-Yeah.

28:19.907 --> 28:22.952
It was hard to tear myself away
from the action at my lab, but...

28:23.786 --> 28:26.747
Um, your preference? We have a selection.

28:27.623 --> 28:28.624
Earl Grey?

28:29.542 --> 28:31.710
I knew there was something about you.

28:34.088 --> 28:38.300
I've gathered up everything I could find
from Maddox's tenure at the Institute.

28:38.384 --> 28:41.595
Most of what was there got black-boxed
after he disappeared,

28:41.679 --> 28:44.640
but they left some
of the ancillary stuff untouched.

28:45.182 --> 28:46.642
I was thinking about the painting.

28:47.143 --> 28:49.520
Bruce and Data were friends,
after a fashion.

28:49.603 --> 28:53.482
If Bruce is using Data's neurons
to make more synths,

28:53.566 --> 28:57.111
it would make sense to model them
after the painting Data made.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.237
Indeed.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.408
I also did a little digging
into Dahj Asha.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.661
You were right.
She was accepted at Daystrom.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.955
In fact, she was the perfect candidate.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.708
In hindsight, a little too perfect.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.252
Her credentials were bogus.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.045
It's more insidious than that.

29:15.129 --> 29:16.505
I checked with Regulus.

29:16.589 --> 29:20.426
Their records show she was enrolled there,
and her grade transcripts are on file.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.344
So, she was what she claimed to be?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.597
She was a complete work of fiction.

29:25.848 --> 29:29.351
There's no record of her
having actually attended R3SA.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.229
I'm no forensics maven,

29:32.313 --> 29:36.942
but my sense is that her entire identity
was built all at once

29:37.026 --> 29:38.194
about three years ago.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.446
By whom? Bruce Maddox?

29:40.946 --> 29:42.740
He certainly had the ability.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.825
-Motive?
-I don't know.

29:46.327 --> 29:50.706
People in the synthetic humanoid field
tend to get a little secret-planny.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.752
-Milk?
-Yes, please. Thank you.

30:01.717 --> 30:02.801
There you go.

30:02.885 --> 30:03.886
Oh, thank you.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.891
It breaks my heart
that I never got a chance to meet her.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.268
Such a wondrous thing.

30:12.186 --> 30:16.690
And the damn Romulans just wiped her away.

30:19.652 --> 30:24.490
You asked me what the plan was,
what she was after at Daystrom.

30:25.074 --> 30:27.910
I don't think that's
the most relevant question right now.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.204
I think the question
you should be trying to answer is--

30:30.287 --> 30:32.039
"What about the other one?"

30:33.165 --> 30:35.334
If she is really out there,

30:35.417 --> 30:38.504
and if the Romulans
haven't gotten to her too...

30:39.964 --> 30:41.674
then where is she?

30:41.757 --> 30:43.133
And what is she after?

30:53.811 --> 30:58.482
Continuing procedure
on patient 8923 stroke three.

30:58.566 --> 30:59.817
One of the Nameless.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.531
Time in regenestasis, 14 years.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.284
Arm implant was successfully removed.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.500
Initiating ocular harvest procedure
on Nameless.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.838
You know I hate it when you use that term.

31:25.259 --> 31:27.011
You may have mentioned that once.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.555
Why do you call them the Nameless?

31:30.556 --> 31:33.225
Their species had a name.
We just don't know what it was.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.686
Nameless is a name.

31:42.151 --> 31:44.278
Removing ocular processing core.

31:53.245 --> 31:56.332
Tertiary mandible implant.
Containment complete.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.876
Tagged for level ten storage.

32:03.464 --> 32:05.132
Tagged for level one disposal.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.052
You are free now, my friend.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.323
-Raffi, it's Jean-Luc.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.034
Please don't hang up. I need your help.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.287
I need a ship.

33:32.803 --> 33:34.513
Picard again?

33:34.596 --> 33:38.600
And we all thought that he was
safely mothballed on that vineyard of his.

33:38.684 --> 33:41.687
All these years, the hermit of La Barre.

33:41.770 --> 33:44.064
Now suddenly he is inescapable.

33:44.148 --> 33:46.024
That's one word for what he is.

33:46.108 --> 33:49.236
Going on and on about advanced synthetics,
Bruce Maddox and--

33:49.319 --> 33:50.988
Bruce Maddox?

33:51.071 --> 33:53.449
-Is he still alive?
-Does it even matter?

33:53.532 --> 33:54.825
And then there was this wild talk

33:54.908 --> 33:58.078
about clandestine Romulan
anti-synth ops here on Earth.

33:58.162 --> 33:59.413
It was just...

34:00.831 --> 34:02.082
It was just sad.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.877
One might be even inclined to say tragic.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.130
Admiral Clancy,
I know I need hardly remind you,

34:08.213 --> 34:12.217
if the Romulans were running
clandestine operations on Earth,

34:12.301 --> 34:13.635
I would know.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.013
And then you would know.

34:16.430 --> 34:18.307
And then all of Starfleet would know,

34:18.390 --> 34:22.770
because clearly that would be
an overt and intolerable act of war.

34:22.853 --> 34:23.854
Of course.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.023
Look, Commodore,
obviously there's nothing to it,

34:26.106 --> 34:29.860
but I thought I'd better check,
out of an excess of caution, as they say.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.612
-Just look into it.
-Of course.

34:35.282 --> 34:37.868
Lieutenant Rizzo to me, please.

34:37.951 --> 34:38.952
What?

34:39.787 --> 34:41.079
Have you gone mad?

34:41.163 --> 34:42.915
-Is it dementia?
-I beg your pardon?

34:42.998 --> 34:44.958
Sorry, but you're not a stupid man,

34:45.042 --> 34:49.046
so when I hear you say such a stupid idea,
I have to ask for other explanations.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.048
Well, how about this?

34:51.632 --> 34:55.803
The daughter of the man whose death
I have been mourning for two decades

34:55.886 --> 34:58.222
comes to me for help and assistance.

34:58.305 --> 35:03.477
And then she is assassinated in front
of my eyes by a Romulan death squad

35:03.560 --> 35:07.898
who will then go and try and find
and destroy her twin sister.

35:09.107 --> 35:13.111
And you want me to sit here worrying what
to do about the spittlebugs on the pinots?

35:13.195 --> 35:14.988
I want you not to die.

35:15.072 --> 35:18.116
No one but the Tal Shiar could ever
protect you against the Tal Shiar.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.161
She's not wrong. You can't go without us.

35:21.745 --> 35:25.165
Idiot! He cannot go at all.
He's only safe here.

35:25.249 --> 35:27.376
He knows about them.
They have to eliminate him.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.420
Nevertheless, I have to go.

35:30.838 --> 35:32.506
Go where? Go how?

35:33.173 --> 35:36.802
Well, I will get a ship,
and I will find Bruce Maddox,

35:36.885 --> 35:38.220
wherever he is.

35:38.303 --> 35:41.223
Laris, I have to do this.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.935
I don't yet fully understand all of it,

35:45.018 --> 35:47.104
but I know that it's important,

35:47.187 --> 35:48.397
and not only to me.

35:48.814 --> 35:51.316
No, of course,
if it's important to Jean-Luc Picard,

35:51.400 --> 35:53.443
it must be important to the whole galaxy.

35:54.653 --> 35:55.696
Go.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.282
And take that one with you!

35:58.824 --> 36:00.200
You can die together.

36:04.288 --> 36:07.457
Laris understands.
She's afraid for you. That's all.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.042
I know that.

36:09.126 --> 36:12.087
But you have to stay here with her.

36:12.629 --> 36:16.174
The grapes are far more
in need of protection than I am.

36:16.717 --> 36:19.344
And it's less than a month to the harvest.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.388
But you can't do it alone.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.974
-You need help. You need protection.
-Yeah.

36:24.057 --> 36:28.145
You need a crew. Riker. Worf. La Forge.
Hmm?

36:29.521 --> 36:31.607
No.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.609
I thought about it.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.111
And they would do it in a heartbeat,

36:36.194 --> 36:39.489
and that's precisely why
I cannot ask them.

36:39.573 --> 36:42.784
They would put themselves at risk
out of loyalty to me,

36:42.868 --> 36:46.163
and I do not want
to have to go through that again.

36:46.997 --> 36:47.998
Okay.

36:48.415 --> 36:52.044
You need someone who hates you
and has nothing to lose.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.339
I've already made the call.

37:01.053 --> 37:02.888
-Come.

37:06.475 --> 37:08.143
You wanted to see me, Commodore?

37:08.810 --> 37:10.646
Take a look at this.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.856
Does that look like disrupter fire?

37:13.315 --> 37:14.483
There.

37:15.275 --> 37:16.777
Reflected in the handrail.

37:17.611 --> 37:18.946
Not to me, no.

37:22.324 --> 37:24.326
Admiral Clancy just called.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.411
Jean-Luc Picard came to see her.

37:26.495 --> 37:30.999
He has information about clandestine
Romulan ops here on Earth.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.794
He referred to Zhat Vash by name.

37:33.877 --> 37:36.546
He was trying to persuade her
to give him a ship

37:36.630 --> 37:39.216
and let him go after Dr. Bruce Maddox.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.052
Although she did not mention
that last part

37:42.135 --> 37:44.262
nor the talk about Zhat Vash.

37:44.346 --> 37:47.849
-Then how do you know?
-Do not insult me, Lieutenant.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.644
It would not be advantageous
for your career.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.563
Apologies, Commodore.

37:53.647 --> 37:55.232
This is unexpected.

37:55.315 --> 37:58.568
A dirty word in our line of work.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.404
Perhaps the worst word of all.

38:00.821 --> 38:03.323
So, you need me to take care of Picard?

38:04.449 --> 38:06.660
Your zeal and passion are commendable,

38:07.160 --> 38:10.247
but they are very nearly overbalanced
by your impatience.

38:10.622 --> 38:15.085
There is a fundamental aptness
in the word "undercover"

38:16.044 --> 38:18.422
which you have yet to fully absorb.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.716
So I won't take care of him impatiently.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.677
I'll make it last as long as you like.

38:23.760 --> 38:27.597
Clancy has discouraged him adequately,
I believe.

38:28.223 --> 38:30.559
And if the need arises,

38:31.393 --> 38:33.603
I will take care of Picard.

38:33.687 --> 38:36.273
I want you to stay on mission.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.067
You made a shambles of the operation here.

38:39.151 --> 38:42.904
Your team destroyed the thing
before it could be interrogated

38:42.988 --> 38:44.781
and nearly blew our cover.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.576
We have one more opportunity.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.203
Do not squander it.

38:51.496 --> 38:52.581
Of course.

38:53.457 --> 38:57.210
-I've put my best man on it.
-Have you? I worry about that one.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.049
He too has a troubling penchant
for the unexpected.

39:02.132 --> 39:05.218
And I have had just about my fill
of surprises, Lieutenant.

39:05.302 --> 39:07.262
Do I make myself clear?

39:08.680 --> 39:11.058
I will vouch for him with my life.

39:11.141 --> 39:13.977
Indeed. You will.

39:14.061 --> 39:18.315
Which is why I strongly recommend
that you manage this case in person.

39:19.399 --> 39:20.400
Of course.

39:20.484 --> 39:23.653
Everything is at stake.

39:23.737 --> 39:26.114
See that he does not fail.

39:26.782 --> 39:29.493
See that neither of you does.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.601
You can turn around and call that cab

39:54.684 --> 39:57.104
to take you right back
where you came from.

39:57.187 --> 39:58.897
I just want to talk.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.983
There isn't anything you could say
that I wanna hear.

40:04.945 --> 40:08.115
Secret Romulan assassins
are operating on Earth.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.536
Is that the '86?

40:19.960 --> 40:21.253
Goddamn it.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.856
-Nice of you to knock.
-Why start now?

40:42.774 --> 40:45.318
How's life in Starfleet, Lieutenant Rizzo?

40:46.403 --> 40:49.739
That ridiculous disguise and round ears.

40:49.823 --> 40:51.783
-You look like a plucked wakak.
-Shut up.

40:53.076 --> 40:54.786
-Any progress?
-Yes.

40:54.870 --> 40:57.330
Slow, but I'm still confident

40:57.414 --> 41:00.375
that my approach, which you approved,
is the only sound approach.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.669
I hope that confidence is not misguided.

41:02.752 --> 41:05.422
If your approach
doesn't start paying off very soon,

41:05.505 --> 41:08.967
I'll be obliged to un-approve it,
for both our sakes.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.888
Commodore Oh is quite distressed.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.807
She has been a useful ally
for a long time.

41:15.891 --> 41:17.642
I can't have her turning on us.

41:18.643 --> 41:21.188
-When I arrive--
-When you arrive?

41:22.606 --> 41:24.024
I'm on top of it.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.864
So it would seem.

41:31.781 --> 41:33.408
Have you found the nest?

41:33.491 --> 41:36.870
Has the machine given up
the location of its fellow abominations?

41:38.496 --> 41:40.665
Really, has it told you anything at all?

41:44.461 --> 41:48.173
Grave reservations have been expressed
about your approach, baby brother.

41:48.256 --> 41:51.301
I don't have to tell you
the stakes couldn't be higher.

41:51.384 --> 41:53.011
Oh has reservations...

41:54.095 --> 41:56.306
profound reservations.

41:56.806 --> 41:59.851
There is no one whose survival
matters more to me than yours.

42:02.312 --> 42:03.855
Except my own.

42:05.315 --> 42:08.777
If you've made no progress
by the time I get there,

42:09.653 --> 42:12.948
I will have no choice
but to try my approach,

42:13.448 --> 42:15.825
unfortunate as it may have been.

42:17.911 --> 42:19.788
If there is another such disaster...

42:20.789 --> 42:23.750
it will undoubtedly
consume you and me too.
