WEBVTT

00:05.880 --> 00:07.549
- Ooh, pretty.
- Oh, thanks.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.342
One of my students gave me
this for some reason and --

00:09.426 --> 00:11.177
Hey,
that's a nice sweater.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.971
Oh.
Thank you, Myles.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.223
Uh, wow.
A compliment,

00:15.223 --> 00:16.933
and it wasn't a set up
for a punchline.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.560
I know. I was waiting for,
"Nice sweater.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.103
Didn't know Bert and Ernie
had a yard sale."

00:20.103 --> 00:23.189
But the kids have actually
been really cool lately.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.442
And, like,
excited to learn?

00:25.442 --> 00:28.486
Yeah. No, same. No misbehaving.
The grades are up.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.864
And I'm getting flowers, apparently.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.824
- Like, are we awake?
- You know what?

00:32.824 --> 00:35.910
I think we have finally earned
their enthusiasm and respect.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.288
Well, enthusiasm
I hoped for, but respect?

00:38.288 --> 00:39.748
One can only dream.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.667
Hey, Vick, what's Gucci?

00:42.751 --> 00:45.295
- Ayy!
- And great job on your quiz.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.713
Somebody's been
putting in the work.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.049
Anything for you,
Mr. C!

00:49.049 --> 00:50.842
That was so cute.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.927
Wait.
Who is Mr. C?

00:53.011 --> 00:54.721
I don't know,
but I'm not gonna push it.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.514
I don't want to ruin
what we have by, like,

00:56.598 --> 00:58.308
asking a lot of questions,
right?

00:58.308 --> 01:00.060
Oh, there you are, Jacob.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.770
My auntie's dog
needs her sweater back.

01:04.356 --> 01:06.232
Got 'eem.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.874
Great job, guys!

01:22.874 --> 01:24.167
All A's and B's!

01:24.167 --> 01:25.835
We're all superstars
in this class.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.212
Oh. All right, guys.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.297
Quietly and safely.
Quietly and safely.

01:29.381 --> 01:32.300
It's been a long year
with lots of ups and downs,

01:32.384 --> 01:34.386
but it was all worth it
to get here.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.389
Looks like someone finally has
this teaching thing figured out.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.973
Okay.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.895
Looks like someone forgot
where the floor was.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.398
Let me get some paper
towel and clean that up.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.403
Wait. What...

01:51.403 --> 01:53.446
What the...?

01:53.530 --> 01:55.740
Who did this?

01:59.202 --> 02:00.495
And I told my neighbor,
I said,

02:00.495 --> 02:02.205
"If you call 311
on a native tree,

02:02.205 --> 02:03.832
they are gonna rip it out

02:03.832 --> 02:07.085
without so much as
even consulting an arborist."

02:07.085 --> 02:08.503
And the hilarious thing
about all this --

02:08.503 --> 02:10.213
Nope.

02:10.213 --> 02:13.550
The hilarious things is, the
number for 311 isn't even 311 --

02:13.550 --> 02:15.552
Jacob, please. Stop.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.513
I'm sorry.
It's not you.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.806
Not me.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.808
"Jacob, stop" could have meant,
like, any Jacob.

02:21.808 --> 02:25.270
It's just, I had the whole,
um, principal job

02:25.270 --> 02:27.105
as my only goal
for awhile,

02:27.105 --> 02:29.232
and finding out that that's
not happening anytime soon

02:29.232 --> 02:30.817
has got me
thinking about a lot.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.485
No. I get it.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.029
Yeah, not in the mood
for a story.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.780
Got it.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.575
Hey. You guys want to
hear something weird?

02:38.575 --> 02:39.868
Janine,
read the room.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.287
We are not
in the mood for that.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.329
Okay, well,
then I won't tell you

02:43.413 --> 02:44.664
I found shoe prints
on my desks.

02:44.748 --> 02:45.874
Wait, no.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.376
You found shoe prints
on your desks?

02:48.460 --> 02:49.836
Yeah.
That's weird, right?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.504
- Yeah.
- Wait, hold up.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.465
I found some shoe prints
on my desks, too.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.133
I paid it dust.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.093
It's not the weirdest thing
I've found on my desks.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.345
Yeah.
I found some, too.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.055
I thought
I was going crazy.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.389
Wait, so other people have
found shoe prints

03:01.473 --> 03:02.432
- in their classrooms?
- Yeah.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.933
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.061
Well, nothing's going on
in my classroom.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.229
My desks are as clean
as a whistle.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.481
So, wait, if this is
happening to everybody

03:09.481 --> 03:11.191
except Barbara,
then what's going on?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.068
- It's weird.
- I mean, no idea.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.570
I know what's going on,
and it's bad.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.782
In fact, I've been praying that
it wouldn't breach our walls.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.784
- Ghosts.
- It's called desking.

03:20.784 --> 03:21.951
It's a new online challenge

03:22.035 --> 03:24.079
where kids jump from
desktop to desktop.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.415
Heard about it last week
through the custodial network.

03:27.499 --> 03:28.792
Mm.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.255
These videos
are everywhere.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.883
Mr. Ronson over at
West Adams Elementary

03:36.883 --> 03:38.802
said he's been
cleaning desks for weeks.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.512
- Ohh.
- Oh, geez.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.305
<i>Go! Go! Go!
You got this!</i>

03:42.389 --> 03:44.015
Oh, my God!
There's hundreds of these!

03:44.099 --> 03:45.433
This is horrible!

03:45.517 --> 03:47.310
This can't be what's happening
here, though, right?

03:47.394 --> 03:49.521
I mean, our kids respect us
too much.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.566
Someone could
really get hurt here.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.984
I've already been hurt.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.319
I know about every
Internet trend.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.946
How did I not
find out about this?

03:57.946 --> 04:00.156
We need to
get to the bottom of this.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.492
You know what? I bet you
I can get a shoe print.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.993
Did you clean
your desks off yet?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.954
- No.
- Nasty.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.248
Okay, does anybody
know shoes?

04:11.710 --> 04:13.253
My boyfriend, Zach,
is a total sneaker-head.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.088
He -- He loves shoes
more than anything.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.174
Well, except ya boy.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.051
That's me. I'm "ya boy."

04:20.844 --> 04:23.388
Okay. It doesn't look like
anything I can find online.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.265
When's your
shoe guy get here?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.225
Uh, he is
on his way.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.060
So this Zach,
he lives with you?

04:29.144 --> 04:30.895
Yeah. He just moved in
last month.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.313
And that's going well?

04:32.397 --> 04:34.232
Yep.
He's so great.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.736
So he knew you
and was like...more?

04:39.195 --> 04:41.489
Well, I think he sounds like
a really neat guy, right?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.408
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Sure. Yeah.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.119
- Heyyy. There's my guy.
- Black?!

04:46.119 --> 04:48.747
It's actually pronounced "Zach."
You must be Ava.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.915
You were
all thinking it.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.083
I see you.
Don't look at me like that.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.835
We always look at you
like this.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.253
It's very nice to
meet you, Zach.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.756
Well, if it isn't
my pizza crust queen.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.844
We went out to eat last week
and I ate all his pizza crust.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.012
I don't like to waste food.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.513
Wait, is this
our desker?

05:05.597 --> 05:06.598
Yes.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.932
Huh.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.143
Huh? What -- What do you
mean by "huh"?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.269
It looked smaller
in the pic.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.480
This is way too big
to be a second grader.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.899
- They laughing in our faces.
- Mm-hmm.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.984
If this was
a small adult sneaker,

05:18.068 --> 05:21.404
it increases the make and model
options significantly.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.199
He's so smart.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.659
We came in 3rd at trivia night
last week over at Oscar's.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.702
You know,
down by Rittenhouse.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.245
We were eliminated
on a technicality,

05:29.329 --> 05:30.622
but Sri Lanka,
if you didn't know --

05:30.622 --> 05:32.832
Honey, where is
this story going?

05:32.916 --> 05:35.043
Are we focusing on
the task at hand?

05:35.043 --> 05:37.754
Mnh. No, we're not.
I'm so sorry. Please continue.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.715
Did he just stop Jacob
from being...himself?

05:40.799 --> 05:42.967
Can we put him in glass
and break in case of emergency?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.636
All right,
let's get to work.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.013
They say the first 48 hours
are the most important.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.556
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.850
Are those the black and grey
asymmetric midsoles?

05:52.185 --> 05:55.146
I decided to be adventurous
and wear sneakers today.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.356
Sick.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.693
- All right.
- Okay. Thank you.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.029
- I like him.
- Mm.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.614
Still don't know
how he lives with Jacob.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.825
You think his neck gets tired
from all the nodding?

06:06.825 --> 06:08.785
Mm-hmm.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.539
Just got an e-mail from Zach.
Subject: "You're welcome."

06:12.539 --> 06:13.790
- Ooh.
- Oh.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.917
Oh, we about to bust
this case wide open.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.627
Uh...okay.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.630
He says that while he initially
leaned Jordan 5s,

06:20.714 --> 06:21.840
the faint line at
the mid-arch

06:21.840 --> 06:24.384
indicates a swoosh
and not the Jumpman logo --

06:24.384 --> 06:25.677
Okay.
Scroll. Scroll.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.054
- Is there a picture?
- Yeah.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.889
- Oh.
- Ooh.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.099
Okay, well,
this is great.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.642
All we have to do is
look at the kids' feet,

06:32.726 --> 06:34.853
which is something I would say
we normally wouldn't do, but...

06:34.853 --> 06:36.312
No. We don't.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.981
'Cause I've only seen those
on two kids --

06:37.981 --> 06:39.524
Brianna and Stefon.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.651
Yeah, but let's not rush out
and make accusations.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.820
I'm coming for you!

06:47.574 --> 06:50.535
Okay, let's split 'em up
and make 'em sing.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.704
Two of you take Stefon,
the other two take Brianna.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.372
Right.
Good cop, bad cop.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.458
You know, it's interesting that
they say "good cop, bad cop,"

06:56.458 --> 06:58.585
because policing in
this country is so broken,

06:58.585 --> 07:00.378
it's really just
"bad cop, bad cop."

07:00.462 --> 07:02.756
- Janine, you're with him.
- Got it.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.883
Look, Stefon,
I get it.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.760
I was a kid once.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.762
But you and I both know
this is gonna end,

07:08.762 --> 07:10.347
and when it does,
you don't wanna be the one

07:10.347 --> 07:11.598
left holding the bag.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.058
'Cause that's exactly
what's gonna happen

07:13.058 --> 07:16.061
when your friend over there
starts talking.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.103
I bet she ratting you out
right now

07:17.187 --> 07:18.396
like a little
Fredo Corleone.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.607
So I would talk
if I were you.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.150
'Cause you don't want me
sending you over to

07:22.150 --> 07:23.943
Ms. Teagues
and Mr. Hill.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.738
I don't think you'd like
what's going on in that room.

07:26.738 --> 07:31.368
Look, sometimes, sometimes,
the right thing is fun.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.704
So why don't you tell us
who started this

07:34.788 --> 07:36.664
and who's doing it?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.249
You know,
doesn't that sound fun?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.169
Okay, kid.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.797
First one to talk,
first one to walk.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.340
How'd those shoes
get on that desk?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.759
- Name names!
- Yeah, name names.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.552
TikTok, Twitch,
Discord?

07:49.636 --> 07:50.845
Just tell me where
they setting them trends

07:50.929 --> 07:52.347
- and you can leave.
- Yeah.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.932
No. We got to
get a confession.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.975
Squeal, and you can
Dipset like Cam'ron.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.314
You know what?
One second.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.275
Okay.
She's not talking.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.236
Okay. Uh, let me
try something, okay?

08:06.236 --> 08:07.904
Um...

08:07.904 --> 08:10.407
You look
a little thirsty.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.659
Oh,
look what I found.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.578
A nice, cold,
refreshing juice.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.788
I bet you'd like
some juice.

08:16.788 --> 08:19.082
- I'm fine.
- Oh, okay.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.710
'Cause me?
I'm thirsty.

08:25.714 --> 08:28.008
I can't get it in.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.759
You -- You have
to twist it.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.970
Yeah. No. I can --
I can do it myself.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.431
Ah.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.349
Oh.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.270
I'm sorry, you tired?

08:40.270 --> 08:41.855
Want some coffee?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.982
'Cause I can do this
all day, kid.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.484
I got all the time
in the world.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.944
No, we don't.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.113
Tell me who started this
viral sensation,

08:50.113 --> 08:51.406
or I swear to God...

08:51.406 --> 08:53.783
- Boy, if you test me.
- Okay, Ava, let's go outside.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.702
- Don't you play with me, boy.
- Now, Ava.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.456
Can't believe
neither of them talked.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.582
I'm actually
sort of proud.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.376
All right, let 'em out.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.086
All right, let's go.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.716
We're gonna figure this out,
you guys.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.301
Yeah.
Somebody's gonna slip up.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.719
It's out of your control, oldhead.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.138
Abbott's gonna be number one
in this challenge.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.766
Wait. You're trying to be
number one in all of Philly?

09:17.766 --> 09:21.144
- In all of the United States.
- Of America.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.896
It's bigger than
you can imagine.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.647
Bigger than me.
Bigger than you.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.524
You'll never stop this.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.234
- Okay. Get back to class.
- Yeah.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.486
No problem.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.820
That's where the desks are.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.867
Okay, since none
of the kids are talking,

09:35.867 --> 09:37.952
we gotta catch
one of them in the act.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.289
Then we flip that kid,
follow it up to the top.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.791
Who wants to go fishing?

09:42.791 --> 09:44.209
Okay.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.461
Well, nobody is jumping up
on my desks,

09:46.461 --> 09:49.381
so this is feeling like
y'all's problem.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.466
I could do a <i>21 Jump Street</i>
kind of thing.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.551
If I put on the right hat,
I could pull off 13.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.011
I don't think so.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.304
How about we get you
some platform shoes

09:56.388 --> 09:57.889
- and you can pull off 12.
- Okay.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.474
I can catch one of 'em.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.685
Haven't done this kind of
fishing in a minute.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.353
Let's go.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.313
I didn't volunteer.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.732
A stakeout needs two people.
Think, boy.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.234
Who's gonna watch
all the crime stuff

10:09.234 --> 10:10.944
while the other one
eats a hoagie?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.405
I...

10:13.405 --> 10:14.531
We're going about this
all wrong.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.907
You know,
you don't build a dam

10:15.907 --> 10:17.409
in the middle of
a rushing river.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.619
You build it
before the water comes.

10:19.703 --> 10:20.662
That is so wise.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.080
What the hell are you
talking about?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.541
If we talk to the younger kids
about the dangers of desking

10:24.541 --> 10:26.292
and how it actually
isn't cool beans,

10:26.376 --> 10:28.461
then we stop the desking
before the flood.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.921
And I think
they'll listen to us,

10:30.005 --> 10:33.133
because they don't look at us
as teachers and students.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.344
We've built bonds this year
that are deeper than that.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.846
- Oh, please.
- That's not gonna work.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.181
- I think that's a great idea.
- Not in a million years. Okay,

10:40.265 --> 10:42.058
we get a kid to rat, okay?
Uh-huh.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.062
I FaceTimed
my own iPad from my phone

10:46.146 --> 10:48.023
and left my phone
in Janine's room

10:48.023 --> 10:50.275
- so we could survey the scene.
- Ah.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.318
This ain't my first rodeo, <i>hombre.</i>

10:52.402 --> 10:55.655
I've staken out before.

10:55.739 --> 10:56.823
You stake out
other classrooms?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.908
No, you creep.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.119
I did private investigator
work back in the day.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.204
You were a private investigator
before a custodian?

11:03.288 --> 11:05.999
No, before I worked
at the rodeo.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.042
Oh. Sorry.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.877
I just -- I thought that,
you know...

11:08.877 --> 11:11.004
What, that I've been a custodian
my whole life?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.505
No, man.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.923
I worked
as a pipe fitter,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.509
a minor league baseball
bunting coach,

11:16.593 --> 11:20.597
a tastefully nude model,
sold RVs for summer.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.058
Might find a new path
after this.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.644
Wait, you never dreamed of
just doing one thing?

11:26.728 --> 11:28.438
Sure, I have.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.106
But a dream can be
a distraction

11:30.190 --> 11:32.108
just as easy as
it can be a goal.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.405
We got movement!

11:37.489 --> 11:39.616
Show yourself, coward!

11:39.616 --> 11:42.285
Aw, man, it's just
Janine and Jacob.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.870
Let's go.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.289
No one's gonna go desking
with teachers in the room.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.586
<i>All right!</i>

11:53.213 --> 11:55.423
Interesting.

11:55.507 --> 12:00.804
So, we have gathered you here
today, dearly B-students...

12:00.804 --> 12:02.639
Get it?

12:02.639 --> 12:04.474
Okay. Keep going.
We knew it was 50/50.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.852
Yeah. We are here today
to talk about desking.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.646
What's desking?

12:09.646 --> 12:10.980
Ah, good question.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.651
Desking is getting from one side
of the classroom to the other

12:14.651 --> 12:16.653
by hopping on
the tops of desks.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.154
I never heard of it.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.447
I wanna do it!

12:19.531 --> 12:20.907
Is she
messing with you,

12:20.907 --> 12:22.367
or are we just teaching
more kids what it is?

12:22.367 --> 12:23.493
No, no, no, no.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.621
Look,
is desking cool beans?

12:26.705 --> 12:28.665
Sure, it is. Right?

12:28.665 --> 12:30.083
But me
and my dawg here...

12:31.418 --> 12:32.669
...are not here to
lie to you

12:32.669 --> 12:35.255
and pretend that desking
isn't cool.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.675
But guess what's
maybe even more cool?

12:38.675 --> 12:40.552
Huh?

12:43.263 --> 12:46.016
Okay!
Are you hearing this?

12:49.227 --> 12:51.354
- Teamwork!
- Teamwork!

12:54.858 --> 12:57.736
- It went great!
- It really did.

12:57.736 --> 12:58.778
I mean, I'm surprised,

12:58.862 --> 12:59.988
but also not surprised.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.990
- The kids were so invested --
- Hello.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.159
<i>Hey, I'm sending you a video
that you need to watch.</i>

13:04.159 --> 13:06.411
Wait, wait. Why are you
FaceTiming me? I'm at work.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.495
<i>'Cause I want to be
referenced in the story</i>

13:07.579 --> 13:08.705
<i>when you tell it later.</i>

13:08.705 --> 13:11.291
- <i>-
- Love you, bye!</i>
- Uh...

13:11.291 --> 13:13.960
Oh, my God. Zach has been
so great during all of this.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.004
I know. He can get
a little obsessive, but...

13:16.004 --> 13:18.298
- Well, so can you.
- Me? No.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.592
No, Zach calls me
"lovingly over-passionate."

13:21.968 --> 13:23.094
You know what?
That's wonderful.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.930
Oh, my God, it's a video
of you and me from just now.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.098
Oh! Oh, my God.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.516
Like two minutes ago?
That's so cool.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.227
The kids are already
spreading our message!

13:38.068 --> 13:41.488
Yep, there they are,
spreading your message.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.740
Aw, man. Why am I not
getting these videos?

13:43.740 --> 13:45.033
I've done everything
I possibly can

13:45.033 --> 13:46.409
to make my phone think
I'm 22.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.578
I haven't used
capital letters in years.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.080
My God. I cannot believe
they betrayed our trust.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.581
Okay, all right,
we need -- we need to just

13:51.581 --> 13:53.041
make sure that this is
an isolated incident and --

13:53.041 --> 13:54.334
Yeah.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.379
Sweet baby Jesus,
and the grown one, too!

13:57.379 --> 13:59.297
My desks
have been desked!

13:59.381 --> 14:01.049
- They got you?
- Mm-hmm.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.550
Oh, this is bad.

14:02.634 --> 14:03.968
- Mnh!
- Their fault.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.303
They went on a desking
promotional tour.

14:05.387 --> 14:08.014
- No, uh --
- What have you done?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.810
- All right.
- Guys?

14:13.812 --> 14:15.689
They have
made fools of us.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.898
I really thought that
they looked at us

14:16.898 --> 14:19.275
as more than just teachers
but, like, friends.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.236
Maybe
that's the problem.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.904
They like us so much,

14:22.904 --> 14:24.698
they've forgotten that
we're authority figures.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.117
Whoa.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.202
We're actually
too cool for school.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.121
Mm-hmm. And now this thing
is spreading everywhere.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.956
- We are losing control.
- We're out of moves.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.708
You lose Barbara,
you lose the war.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.629
We might have
one move left.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.089
We can tell
the school district.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.799
This is happening
all over the city.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.426
- Of Philadelphia.
- Yeah.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.302
So they will bring
that hammer down

14:46.386 --> 14:47.721
and put an end
to all this.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.765
Do we really want to
become narcs?

14:52.684 --> 14:54.519
I prefer "heroes."

14:55.562 --> 14:57.313
- So they were receptive?
- Oh, very receptive.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.356
They don't want to be sued

14:58.440 --> 15:00.025
if some kid slips
and falls on a desk.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.652
Hey, Ally,
what -- what are you doing?

15:02.736 --> 15:03.695
You ain't hear?

15:03.695 --> 15:05.530
The school district's making us
take all our desks

15:05.530 --> 15:08.324
out of our classrooms.
Somebody snitched.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.952
Told the school district that we
have some dangerous viral trend

15:11.036 --> 15:13.413
that could leave the city
at risk for "legal culpability."

15:13.413 --> 15:15.832
All because I wasn't trying to
solve the problem at all.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.126
What idiot thought the school
district was gonna help?

15:18.126 --> 15:20.962
Huh. What -- Yeah, what
well-intentioned idiot?

15:21.046 --> 15:22.172
Get all your desks to the gym

15:22.172 --> 15:23.548
until this whole thing
blows over

15:23.548 --> 15:25.091
or there's some new trend
that I don't hear about

15:25.175 --> 15:27.927
because life is a joke, people.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.137
Come on. Hurry up.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.764
Who knows when those kids'll
start arriving.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.432
They get here at 7:30.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.061
Every day? That's wild.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.565
Janine, how many times
is tattling

15:40.565 --> 15:43.234
gonna bite you in the <i>culo</i>
before you quit being a narc?

15:43.318 --> 15:46.654
Mm. I am too old to be doing
all of this.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.990
At least you guys are on
the same floor as the gym.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.245
Look, guys, I know this is
a minor inconvenience,

15:54.329 --> 15:55.538
but at least
we stopped desking.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.917
- Right? Yay!
- Mm.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.795
Or we've created the greatest
desking arena ever known to man.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.218
What fresh hell
is this?

16:08.218 --> 16:10.553
Oh, Janine.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.308
It's like desking
Six Flags!

16:15.392 --> 16:18.728
We are just leading the children
into temptation, like Satan.

16:18.812 --> 16:19.771
Mm-hmm.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.524
Is it that bad?

16:22.524 --> 16:24.734
I think if I was a young person
who was interested in desking,

16:24.818 --> 16:27.487
it might, you know,
call to me.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.364
Relax, y'all. I've been
refreshing all my feeds,

16:29.364 --> 16:30.407
and we're in the clear.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.825
There's no way the kids
know about this.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.077
You sure about that?

16:34.077 --> 16:36.454
<i>By the end of the week,</i>

16:36.538 --> 16:40.291
<i>I will desk
the Abbott Elementary Gym.</i>

16:41.418 --> 16:43.294
- Oh, nooooo.
- No!

16:43.378 --> 16:45.797
Okay, look.
No, no, no. No.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.549
Don't worry, don't worry,
because we'll just take turns

16:47.549 --> 16:49.175
- guarding the entrance.
- No!

16:49.259 --> 16:51.011
Why is my Internet not
sending me anything cool?

16:51.011 --> 16:54.055
I should have gotten that video
before Mr. Johnson.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.098
No offense, boo.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.766
It is not your phone, Ava.

16:56.850 --> 17:00.020
You are not one of them.
You are not a Jojo Sea-bass.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.188
You mean JoJo Siwa?

17:02.272 --> 17:03.440
I don't know what I mean, Janine.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.899
That's the point.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.110
But I do know that you all
need to stop pretending

17:07.110 --> 17:09.112
like you can relate to
these children.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.407
Because when you do,
it just seems sad, desperate,

17:12.407 --> 17:13.825
and embarrassing.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.952
Mm.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.580
You heard Barbara.
Y'all are embarrassing.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.255
I know your plan.
Move it along.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.300
That face don't work
on me.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.846
Need a partner
for this shift?

17:34.846 --> 17:36.598
Oh, no. I'm good.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.267
Just need two men for
a stakeout and a foot chase.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.936
Right.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.938
All right,
what do you want?

17:44.022 --> 17:45.315
You remember what you were
talking about?

17:45.315 --> 17:47.108
Nope.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.152
About having
a lot of jobs.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.905
You ever have an experience
where you wanted a different job

17:51.905 --> 17:53.448
than the one
you were at?

17:53.448 --> 17:55.533
You liked the one
that you were at,

17:55.617 --> 17:58.661
but since it's not the one
that you thought you wanted,

17:58.745 --> 18:00.330
you're
a little conflicted?

18:00.330 --> 18:02.582
If you think
I'm some sort of Black Yoda...

18:02.582 --> 18:06.002
Hmm, then correct you
would be, Padawan.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.755
You got to be open
for what life brings you.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.840
If I'd kept aiming for
that one job

18:10.924 --> 18:12.967
I wanted so much
when I was your age,

18:13.051 --> 18:17.013
you'd be looking at a very
unfulfilled operations manager

18:17.097 --> 18:19.849
at
Uncle Bradley's Baked Beans.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.518
Damn,
I wanted that job.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.186
Must have had some
good benefits.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.896
And a ladder
straight to the top.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.690
- Yeah.
- But, hey,

18:26.690 --> 18:28.858
without that rejection,

18:28.942 --> 18:31.486
I never would have found out
the stuff that I love.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.322
Yeah, man. I really
wanted to be principal.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.868
Then it didn't happen and...

18:38.952 --> 18:41.037
and now I think
I'm mad.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.707
You got plenty of time,
youngin'.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.208
Attentions, please!

18:47.127 --> 18:50.547
I really felt like I was
bonding with these kids

18:50.547 --> 18:52.549
and that they liked me,

18:52.549 --> 18:55.218
and as much as I felt that,

18:55.218 --> 18:58.930
and as much as Ava
wants to be cool,

18:59.014 --> 19:00.890
Barbara was right.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.309
Kids will always
think teachers are lame.

19:03.393 --> 19:08.023
Can't fight that,
but we can use it.

19:08.023 --> 19:12.235
Once I do this
and those kids see it,

19:12.235 --> 19:15.155
desking will be corny
and over.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.824
Jacob, we rolling?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.784
Kill it!

19:19.868 --> 19:21.244
You got this, Janine.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.996
- Whoo!
- Don't -- Don't say that.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.539
- I don't believe that she does.
- No. She's got it.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.416
- She's not very coordinated.
- She's gonna kill it.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.459
Oh!

19:27.459 --> 19:29.502
- God.
- And she's down.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.921
Oh. Oh. I'm okay. No.
Ow. I'm okay.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.507
Ow. No, no, no.
I can still do this.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.052
You know, this is
my Kerri Strug moment.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.762
No, it's your "stay down and
let me get you some ice" moment.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.221
Okay?
Y-Your ankle's blowing up.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.474
You're not gonna be walking,
let alone desking.

19:42.474 --> 19:43.683
But someone has to do this.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.852
Someone the kids will think
is really lame.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.234
- You got this, Jacob.
- Yes.

19:53.318 --> 19:54.694
Come on, man.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.905
Hey.
I got your sneakers.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.074
I've been begging him
to wear these.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.367
These are
the Honeydews.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.827
Now, some people think that
this color is sea glass,

20:02.911 --> 20:04.371
but that's completely ignoring
the history of the entire --

20:04.371 --> 20:06.081
Babe, babe,
task at hand.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.957
Ah. You're right.
I'm doing it again.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.461
Anyways, the point is these were
built for comfort and speed.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.713
Also,
I brought your shorts.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.674
Oh, thanks, babe.

20:15.674 --> 20:18.301
So, just out of curiosity,
how'd you guys meet?

20:18.385 --> 20:20.553
Ohh, I was in a late night
line for sneakers,

20:20.637 --> 20:23.431
and he was there protesting
the inhumane work conditions

20:23.515 --> 20:24.974
of the place making
the sneakers.

20:25.058 --> 20:29.104
I got the limited edition
- Smokey-
- Foams and a man that day.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.314
Oh.
I get it now.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.650
I forget that Black people
can also be annoying.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.069
What'd you say?

20:37.404 --> 20:39.864
Hey,
what's everyone watching?

20:39.948 --> 20:41.908
Yo, some white boul
desked the gym!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.576
- <i>-
- Check it!</i> Whoa!

20:43.660 --> 20:45.662
He's wearing
the Honeydew suedes.

20:47.122 --> 20:50.166
<i>Abbott Ultimate Desking Challenge.</i>

20:50.250 --> 20:52.752
<i>Done! Teacher style.</i>

20:52.836 --> 20:54.087
- Whoa, what the --
- <i>-
- Whew!</i>

20:54.087 --> 20:56.339
Is that Mr. C?

20:56.423 --> 20:59.050
Desking's deaded.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.933
I can't believe
the video worked.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.602
Yeah. Those kids
do not want to be us.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.479
You know, the fact that
we are doing this well

21:11.563 --> 21:14.607
without clout propping us up
is some good old-fashioned

21:14.691 --> 21:16.484
being-pretty-darn-good-
at-our-jobs.

21:16.568 --> 21:17.819
Yeah. You're right.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.612
But imagine
what it'll be like

21:19.696 --> 21:22.782
when we actually do get them
to think we're cool.

21:29.497 --> 21:33.251
