00:03.369 --> 00:05.303
Hello, bud.
Hey, tim.

00:05.304 --> 00:07.805
Good to see you.
You too, bud.

00:07.806 --> 00:12.544
Tim, you know, I've been
looking over the scripts
and they are terrific.

00:12.545 --> 00:15.113
Great. It's nice to have
a boss appreciate my ideas.

00:15.114 --> 00:19.217
I love what you're doing.
If the ratings in the
new markets aren't good,

00:19.218 --> 00:21.987
Then I hate
what you're doing.

00:21.988 --> 00:25.590
It'll be great.
They'll love us.
I'm sure they're gonna love you.

00:25.591 --> 00:28.059
But I still have
doubts about al.
No...

00:28.060 --> 00:31.329
Yeah, yeah. Which is why
I made a little change.

00:31.330 --> 00:33.364
Change?
Yeah.

00:40.973 --> 00:43.442
This is not me!

00:43.443 --> 00:45.876
Yeah, but that's
what I'm going for.

00:45.877 --> 00:47.912
See, I'm trying to get
that 20-something audience -

00:47.913 --> 00:49.681
That generation x crowd.

00:49.682 --> 00:53.118
This'll make 'em
shut off their tvs.

00:53.119 --> 00:57.422
I wonder how al would
look in a buzz cut?

00:57.423 --> 01:01.193
His mom doesn't
look too good in one.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.961
Does everybody know
what time it is?

01:02.962 --> 01:05.197
Tool time!

01:05.197 --> 01:08.499
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present
tim "the tool man" taylor!

01:08.500 --> 01:10.701
Woo hoo!

01:20.946 --> 01:25.083
Thank you. Thank you, heidi.
And thank you, everyone.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.953
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>
I am tim "the tool man" taylor,

01:27.954 --> 01:29.320
And you know my assistant,

01:29.321 --> 01:33.925
Al "generation x-tra large"
borland.

01:33.926 --> 01:37.629
You might have noticed al's
not sporting his traditional
plaid or flannel today

01:37.630 --> 01:42.934
Because he's got a new look.
I think he looks... Peachy.

01:44.804 --> 01:47.139
I don't feel peachy.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.073
Today we're talking
about do-it-yourself jobs

01:49.074 --> 01:51.108
That aren't actually
do-it-yourself.

01:51.109 --> 01:52.811
Replacing a pane of
glass is one thing,

01:52.812 --> 01:54.946
But for plate glass,
you'll need a helper.

01:54.947 --> 01:57.381
I'll be hiking
the glass in place,

01:57.382 --> 02:00.418
Al will use
a point driver
to secure it.

02:00.419 --> 02:03.021
All right, al, point driver.

02:03.022 --> 02:04.856
Uh, I don't have
my point driver.

02:04.857 --> 02:08.092
Well, thanks for
"pointing" that out.
Where is it?

02:08.094 --> 02:12.730
I left it backstage.
I feel a little flummoxed
without my flannel.

02:16.469 --> 02:21.839
You'll have to forgive al.
He's going through a little
flannel withdrawal.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.877
Next week we're checking
him in to the betty flannel
clinic, so...

02:25.878 --> 02:29.781
While al's getting his
point driver, I can welcome
two new markets for us.

02:29.782 --> 02:33.752
Bottom's up, milwaukee!
And how's it hangin', columbus?

02:33.753 --> 02:36.588
Uh... Gosh!

02:36.589 --> 02:41.593
Al, hurry up.
I'm beginning to feel
like garfield here.

02:41.594 --> 02:45.063
I got it!
Ok. I'm here.

02:45.064 --> 02:49.234
It's just you don't know
what it's like being trapped
in the wrong fabric.

02:49.235 --> 02:52.203
Secure the points
with the point driver.

02:52.204 --> 02:54.171
No problem.
All right.

02:54.172 --> 02:56.574
We'll glaze
the window after...

02:56.575 --> 02:58.810
I left the points
backstage.
I got some here.

03:58.804 --> 04:00.939
Ok, I'm going
to the library
for a few hours.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.707
What are you guys
gonna do today?

04:02.708 --> 04:04.476
Nothing.
Nothing.

04:04.477 --> 04:05.877
Nothing.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.144
I'm supervising.

04:14.687 --> 04:17.654
Well, don't
overwork yourself.

04:19.558 --> 04:21.259
Bye.
<i>(tim)</i> have a good day.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.128
<i>(mark)</i> bye.

04:23.129 --> 04:26.731
All right, guys. Hurry up.
Let's clean this house up.

04:26.732 --> 04:29.434
We'll give your mom
the best surprise party ever.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.604
Think she
suspects anything?
Nah.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.974
The party's
two weeks early. Great idea.
I'm glad I thought of it.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.276
I thought of it.

04:38.277 --> 04:41.146
Who thought of having
all the guests wait over
at wilson's?

04:41.147 --> 04:43.548
Dad, I came up with that.

04:43.549 --> 04:47.251
Yeah, but whose idea
was it to have everybody
bring their favorite dish?

04:47.252 --> 04:48.920
Mine.

04:48.921 --> 04:51.356
Why throw mom
a 39th birthday party anyway?

04:51.357 --> 04:53.291
I thought 40
was the big one.

04:53.292 --> 04:56.961
Randy, randy,
randy, randy.

04:56.962 --> 04:59.697
You got a lot
to learn about women.

04:59.698 --> 05:03.134
A woman's 40th birthday party
is something she does
not want to celebrate.

05:03.135 --> 05:06.037
Why not?

05:06.038 --> 05:09.741
Well, because at 40 a woman
feels like she's, you know,
getting old.

05:09.742 --> 05:14.812
And that puts her
in a very bad mood
for a very long time.

05:16.381 --> 05:19.084
How long?

05:19.085 --> 05:21.686
Generally,
the rest of her life.

05:21.687 --> 05:24.622
You see,
at that age women don't
like their looks anymore.

05:24.623 --> 05:26.958
They see their cheeks sagging,
necks hanging.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.194
And before long,

05:29.195 --> 05:32.597
It's inevitable their
entire face will cave right in.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.999
Even a party
can't cheer her up?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.935
I'm sorry to say, mark,
there's not a party big enough

05:36.936 --> 05:40.504
To make a woman happy
who has no face.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.343
Which is why tonight's
party is gonna be great.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.146
I'm flying in aunt carrie,
mom's best friends will be here.

05:48.147 --> 05:51.482
I even invited that lady
she liked at the magazine,
julie zwickie.

05:53.685 --> 05:55.753
Did you say julie zwickie?

05:55.754 --> 06:00.491
No, I said, "goodness, gracious!
These counters are sticky."

06:00.492 --> 06:02.726
Why are you back?
I forgot my psych book.

06:02.727 --> 06:06.464
Ew!
Just mentioning julie zwickie
makes my skin crawl.

06:06.465 --> 06:09.033
I thought you liked her.

06:09.034 --> 06:13.037
Not since I found out
that she bad-mouthed me
when I worked at the magazine.

06:13.038 --> 06:14.872
If I ever see that
backstabbing witch again

06:14.873 --> 06:17.875
I'll squeeze her neck
till her eyes pop out.

06:17.876 --> 06:20.178
See you guys later!

06:20.179 --> 06:23.381
Have a nice day.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.516
Good party game.

06:27.319 --> 06:31.622
Instead of charades,
we can play "pop the eyes
out of julie zwickie."

06:37.429 --> 06:40.030
Hi, wilson.
Jill?

06:40.031 --> 06:42.433
Tim? What are you
doing over there?

06:45.804 --> 06:47.838
Uh...

06:47.839 --> 06:52.109
Wilson called me at work
and said he's going out of town,

06:52.110 --> 06:54.279
So why don't I check to see
if his doors are locked.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.614
I thought you were
at the library.

06:56.615 --> 06:58.816
I was. I got home
a couple hours ago.

06:58.817 --> 07:02.253
I'm looking through
these photo albums my mom
gave me for my birthday.

07:02.254 --> 07:03.254
<i>(wilson whistles)</i>

07:03.255 --> 07:04.923
Hit the deck!

07:12.031 --> 07:13.798
Jill's over there.
Hold these.

07:16.035 --> 07:22.373
Look. That's me at age eight
playing our old family piano.

07:22.374 --> 07:27.312
You look mighty cute
playing that old piece of junk.

07:27.313 --> 07:30.548
It wasn't a piece of junk.
That was an antique.
Uh-huh.

07:30.549 --> 07:33.985
Look how happy I am sitting
there practicing chopsticks.

07:33.986 --> 07:38.656
You were good to be able to eat
chinese food and play the piano
at the same time.

07:38.657 --> 07:41.625
Gosh,
I loved that piano.
Mm-hm.

07:41.626 --> 07:46.197
And dad got transferred
to a base in europe
and gave it away!

07:46.198 --> 07:48.800
I was so upset I cried
all the way to Italy.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.435
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.205
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm.

07:56.408 --> 07:59.443
Kind of reminds me
of my first scroll saw.

08:01.146 --> 08:03.914
Your parents
gave it away?
No, no.

08:03.915 --> 08:06.417
I left it
at the playground.

08:06.418 --> 08:08.987
I put a small motor
in the teeter-totter.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.089
I shot this kid halfway
across the parking lot.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.425
When I got back to the
playground, it was gone.

08:14.426 --> 08:16.594
I always wanted
to track that thing down.

08:16.595 --> 08:19.330
Have you noticed
when I tell you
a story about me,

08:19.331 --> 08:21.799
We wind up
talking about you?

08:21.800 --> 08:23.967
Never noticed.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.675
Good going, wilson.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.243
Maybe next time you'll keep
your "hm-hm-hms" to yourself.

08:33.244 --> 08:36.145
Well, I am sorry, neighbor.
Ok. Your keys.

08:36.147 --> 08:38.282
Hm.
There you go.

08:39.551 --> 08:41.419
<i>(balloons popping)</i>

08:44.656 --> 08:48.092
Al, no eating till
we get to the party, ok?
I'm sorry, tim.

08:48.093 --> 08:52.429
But when they took my
flannel away, I was so upset
I couldn't eat my lunch!

08:54.733 --> 08:57.802
It's not like you couldn't
miss a meal now and then.

08:57.803 --> 08:59.971
Main dishes.
Who brought main dishes?

08:59.972 --> 09:03.207
Well, I've got a wok full of
my delicious kung-pao crickets.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.944
Ew. Somebody else?
Anybody else bring
a main dish?

09:05.945 --> 09:08.880
It's ok. It's ok.
We brought a big bowl
of lobster salad.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.048
Oh, that's just
perfect, marty. Great.

09:11.049 --> 09:13.684
Lobster makes jill
break out in hives.

09:13.685 --> 09:17.988
Marty, why didn't
you know that?
I'm sorry.

09:17.989 --> 09:22.594
I guess I'll just start
keeping a list of all
my relatives' allergies.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.762
Everybody, help get
the lobster out of here.

09:24.763 --> 09:27.632
Just pick in
and get the lobster out.
Quick, quick, quick.

09:31.770 --> 09:34.204
Carrie,
what'd you bring?
Nothing.

09:34.205 --> 09:36.240
You come to your sister's
birthday party and you
don't bring anything?

09:36.241 --> 09:39.376
Tim, I came straight
from the airport.

09:39.377 --> 09:42.780
All I have are my
peanuts from the plane.
I'll take 'em.

09:44.115 --> 09:47.351
Ooh - honey-roasted.
Back off, al.

09:47.352 --> 09:50.955
Put these in the salad.
It'll be like a peanut
pasta thing or something.

09:50.956 --> 09:54.292
Hey, everybody!

09:54.293 --> 09:55.660
What are you doing here?

09:55.661 --> 09:57.628
I heard you were
having a party for jill.

09:57.629 --> 10:00.264
How come I wasn't invited?

10:00.265 --> 10:03.267
I didn't want you
to feel obligated
to bring her a present.

10:03.268 --> 10:06.871
You know me.
I never feel obligated.

10:06.872 --> 10:10.808
Hey, I got the balloons.
I had to go all over town
but I got 'em.

10:10.809 --> 10:13.410
Well, go all over town
and take 'em back.

10:13.411 --> 10:16.714
They say "40th birthday."
it's her 39th.

10:16.715 --> 10:19.449
Her 39th? I thought this
was her 40th birthday.

10:19.450 --> 10:22.053
Me, too. Why not have
the party next year?

10:22.054 --> 10:26.690
Because that's when
a woman falls apart
and her face caves in.

10:29.094 --> 10:30.928
Who told you that?

10:30.929 --> 10:33.698
Dad. He knows
everything about women.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.433
Is that so?

10:35.434 --> 10:39.303
You know what the odd thing is?
This boy has two fathers.

10:39.304 --> 10:41.939
And it was the other father
who would've said something...

10:41.940 --> 10:44.208
Oh, boy.

10:44.209 --> 10:47.311
Why don't you tell us everything
you know about women, tim?

10:47.312 --> 10:48.880
Yeah. We have a second.

10:51.216 --> 10:53.851
Boy, is it hot!
Are you hot at all here?

10:53.852 --> 10:56.054
Benny, can you
help me with this?

10:56.055 --> 11:00.224
I can't.
I thought women fell apart
when they hit 30.

11:00.225 --> 11:03.594
Oh! How could
you say that?!

11:06.331 --> 11:08.399
Hi, brad.
Where's mom?

11:08.400 --> 11:12.770
She's upstairs.
Perfect. Everybody's
at wilson's waiting.

11:12.771 --> 11:14.939
<i>(phone ringing)</i>
get that.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.508
Hello?
Yeah, hold on a second.

11:17.509 --> 11:20.211
Hey, dad,
it's that woman mom hates.
Julie zwickie.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.449
She needs directions
to the party.

11:28.687 --> 11:32.490
Hi, julie. It's tim taylor.
Hi. Where are you now?

11:32.491 --> 11:37.762
Ok, quick. Get on 94, go west.
When you get to 10...

11:37.763 --> 11:40.631
I know, sounds pretty goofy,
doesn't it? But just listen.

11:40.632 --> 11:44.568
When you get to 10,
go... 12 exits.

11:44.569 --> 11:48.606
You get off that exit
and then just look for our
house. You can't miss it.

11:48.607 --> 11:51.942
Ok. Look forward
to seeing you. Ok, bye.

11:55.781 --> 11:59.550
Won't that take her
to canada?
Yes, it will.

11:59.551 --> 12:01.218
It'll be a perfect surprise.

12:01.219 --> 12:04.155
I'll go to the art show
and act like I've got
a stomach ache.

12:04.156 --> 12:09.059
Be back in a half hour.
This is gonna be perfect! Honey!

12:09.060 --> 12:12.463
Ready to go to the art show?
No art show,
I'm going to toledo.

12:12.464 --> 12:15.566
What?
Yeah.
I found my old piano.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.167
What?
I got the idea

12:17.168 --> 12:19.804
When you told me that story
about your scroll saw.

12:19.805 --> 12:22.572
You hated that story!
I did hate it
when I first heard it.

12:22.573 --> 12:26.410
But then I was inspired by it.
Go with the hate!
Go with the hate!

12:26.411 --> 12:30.848
No. You see, when I was growing
up we were always moving around.

12:30.849 --> 12:33.785
My parents used to just
throw away all of our stuff.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.120
So I have nothing
left of my past.

12:36.121 --> 12:38.256
Sure you do.
You have those
beautiful photo...

12:38.257 --> 12:42.426
That's not enough!
My cousin henry has the piano,
he says he'll give it to me.

12:42.427 --> 12:46.330
Movers will meet me there.
I'll be back
in three or four hours.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.632
Three or four?
I'll see you later!

12:48.633 --> 12:50.935
Three or four hours?!

13:06.952 --> 13:09.320
Did you eat
a meatball?
No!

13:09.321 --> 13:11.422
I said nobody eats
until she gets back.
All right?

13:14.626 --> 13:16.693
Benny, benny,
benny, benny, benny.

13:16.694 --> 13:19.997
I'm gonna save this
for the toast.
Is that all right? Ok?

13:19.998 --> 13:24.468
We can't drink anything,
we can't eat anything.
There's no guest of honor.

13:24.469 --> 13:27.305
You throw
a heck of a party.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.841
It's not my fault, marty.
This whole thing
was the kids' idea.

13:34.412 --> 13:39.650
Hey, we're not the ones who
inspired her with that dumb
story about the scroll saw.

13:39.651 --> 13:42.253
This is a disaster.
Now what?

13:42.254 --> 13:45.923
Oh, I just called my service
and found out I have to fly
to norway immediately.

13:45.924 --> 13:47.992
You're flying
to norway now?
Yeah.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.928
I have to photograph a statue
of king olaf in the morning.

13:50.929 --> 13:53.231
You can't leave
jill's party in the middle.

13:53.232 --> 13:56.667
The middle of the party?
When was the beginning?

13:59.070 --> 14:03.341
Can't you be late a couple days?
The statue's not gonna run away.

14:03.342 --> 14:07.044
Tim, it's a big job.
I can't blow off olaf.

14:07.045 --> 14:10.314
You know,
this is unbelievable.
I came all this way

14:10.315 --> 14:12.516
And now my sister
won't even know
I was here.

14:12.517 --> 14:15.319
Yeah, wait a minute.
Yes, she will. Heidi?

14:15.320 --> 14:17.354
My camera, please.
Here you go, tim.

14:17.355 --> 14:19.556
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome.

14:19.557 --> 14:21.191
All right.
Say cheese.

14:21.192 --> 14:23.026
We can eat
the cheese?
No!

14:24.897 --> 14:26.930
Ok, I'm off.

14:29.568 --> 14:32.837
Marie, how are
you holding up?
Oh, I'm doing great, tim.

14:32.838 --> 14:38.175
Considering my bum of a husband
left me for a 25-year-old
meat packer at his plant.

14:38.176 --> 14:40.111
Oh, god, tim.

14:40.112 --> 14:43.514
Wilson, could you help me out
just for a little bit?

14:43.515 --> 14:46.817
Why certainly, neighbor.
Hello, marie.
Hi, wilson.

14:46.818 --> 14:49.287
I'm reminded of the poet,
robert burns, who said,

14:49.288 --> 14:52.589
"had we ne'er lov'd
so kindly, had we ne'er
lov'd sae blindly..."

14:55.560 --> 15:01.132
Tim, maybe you oughta just
cancel the party and have it
on jill's real birthday.

15:01.133 --> 15:04.001
She will be back!

15:04.002 --> 15:06.069
I was just trying to help.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.672
Well, I'm just trying...
Don't snap at me!

15:08.673 --> 15:10.808
I never knew
you could be
such a crab.

15:10.809 --> 15:13.210
We can eat the crab?

15:21.853 --> 15:23.854
Hello?

15:25.524 --> 15:27.925
Hello?

15:27.926 --> 15:30.294
Hello.

15:30.295 --> 15:33.830
Oh, hi, henry.
I'm so excited to see you.

15:33.831 --> 15:35.699
Me, too.
Who are you?

15:38.136 --> 15:41.806
I'm your cousin jill.
We just spoke on the phone
a couple of hours ago.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.874
Tell me more.

15:46.044 --> 15:50.047
I came here to get
my old piano back.

15:50.048 --> 15:56.020
Remember? I told you the story
about how my dad gave your mom
my piano and how crushed I was.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.357
Devastated.
Heartbroken?

15:59.358 --> 16:01.659
Oh! Oh, that jill.

16:01.660 --> 16:05.396
Sorry, I've been
shellacking today.

16:05.397 --> 16:08.098
I get a little fuzzy.

16:11.436 --> 16:13.637
Do you think
we could go in?
Ok.

16:13.638 --> 16:15.873
Yeah.

16:17.308 --> 16:20.244
Wow! Look at all
this stuff!

16:20.245 --> 16:23.814
You like it?
Yes. I do.

16:23.815 --> 16:28.385
You know,
I remember when you used to
pick through our garbage.

16:28.386 --> 16:31.288
I had no idea you were gonna
shellac it and sell it for...

16:31.289 --> 16:34.725
...A lot of money.

16:34.726 --> 16:37.528
It's funny. The garbage
in the can is worth nothing.

16:37.529 --> 16:41.331
But once it's in a gallery
people whip out their checkbooks
faster than you can say...

16:43.368 --> 16:46.503
Whatever it is
that people say.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.239
Well... Put.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.383
Well, henry, the movers
will be here any minute.

16:59.384 --> 17:00.918
I'm moving?

17:03.388 --> 17:06.390
No. You're gonna
give back my old piano,

17:06.391 --> 17:08.858
And I'm gonna
take it to detroit.
Right.

17:08.859 --> 17:09.992
Right.
Right.

17:09.993 --> 17:11.494
Right.

17:11.496 --> 17:14.798
So, henry,
where is the piano?

17:14.799 --> 17:16.666
Oh, it's over here.

17:23.007 --> 17:25.175
This is my piano?
Yeah.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.278
I don't believe it.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.346
Thanks.
Wait till you see this.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.684
<i>(train whistle)</i>

17:42.326 --> 17:44.461
It's 10:30.
Maybe we should cut the cake.

17:44.462 --> 17:47.264
Cake?
Now you're talking.

17:47.265 --> 17:49.900
Somebody light
the candles and make a wish.

17:49.901 --> 17:53.704
I wish I didn't eat so many
kung-pao crickets.

17:53.705 --> 17:58.109
Keep getting this weird urge
to rub my legs together.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.643
Jill's coming!
Jill's coming! Shh!

17:59.644 --> 18:02.947
Finally!
Everybody, hide!
Quiet!

18:02.948 --> 18:05.816
What's she doing?
She's standing,
staring at the sky.

18:05.817 --> 18:07.485
Go hide. Hide.
Everybody, hide.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.887
Don't touch that cake
until I get back.

18:12.691 --> 18:15.492
Hey, I've been waiting for you.
What are you doing?

18:17.462 --> 18:21.098
Watching my dreams
float away into the far
reaches of nothingness.

18:21.099 --> 18:23.834
I can't see them.

18:23.835 --> 18:25.936
You can do that
inside, can't ya?

18:25.937 --> 18:30.407
Tim. It was such
a depressing day.
My cousin ruined my piano.

18:30.408 --> 18:33.143
I'll get you another.
Let's talk about it inside.

18:33.144 --> 18:37.815
I don't want to talk about it.
I think I just want to be alone.

18:37.816 --> 18:41.418
Surprise!

18:46.657 --> 18:50.093
I'm sorry things didn't go so
smoothly. I wanted this to be
a special night for you.

18:50.094 --> 18:52.062
It was special.

18:52.063 --> 18:55.132
There were only
11 people here.

18:55.133 --> 18:57.434
Yeah. But 11 people
I really love.

18:57.435 --> 19:00.904
Well, I mean,
ten plus benny.

19:00.905 --> 19:03.306
I'm sorry about
that piano thing.

19:03.307 --> 19:06.076
Oh, it was crazy for me to go
chasing after that anyway.

19:06.077 --> 19:08.946
No, it wasn't.
Yes, it was.

19:08.947 --> 19:13.551
I was just trying to
go back into my past
and find something I lost.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.986
We can do it another time,
I'll go with you.

19:15.987 --> 19:19.456
We'll make a weekend
out of it.
That's ok, tim.

19:19.457 --> 19:23.860
You know, when I
walked in here tonight

19:23.861 --> 19:26.730
I saw all the things that
have meaning in my life.

19:26.731 --> 19:29.700
Great friends,
wonderful family,

19:29.701 --> 19:32.869
A husband who was
sensitive enough
to throw me a birthday party

19:32.870 --> 19:35.405
The year before
my face caved in.

19:40.545 --> 19:42.713
Oh, you heard that?
Yeah, I heard that.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.649
So, honey,

19:45.650 --> 19:48.652
Are you still gonna love me
when I'm all droopy and saggy?

19:48.653 --> 19:50.754
Come on!
I already do.

19:53.424 --> 19:56.460
I fell in love with you
and I intend to fall apart
with you. Hm?

19:57.629 --> 20:00.631
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

20:00.632 --> 20:02.066
Who is that at this
time of the night?

20:02.067 --> 20:04.601
It's probably al
looking for leftovers.

20:14.979 --> 20:18.816
I'm sorry I'm late,
but those directions
you gave me were terrible!

20:20.952 --> 20:23.420
Julie zwickie?

20:23.421 --> 20:26.423
Happy birthday!

20:34.598 --> 20:36.799
Oh, thank you so much!

20:43.775 --> 20:44.908
What is this?

20:44.909 --> 20:47.577
We did something
special for you.

20:47.578 --> 20:48.645
All right.
Where do you want her?

20:48.646 --> 20:51.180
Right here.
Perfect.
Perfect.

20:51.181 --> 20:54.651
All right, mom.
What's the one thing you want
most in the whole world?

20:54.652 --> 20:57.387
Never to see
julie zwickie again.

20:57.388 --> 21:00.323
Got that. We got something
real special for you.

21:00.324 --> 21:02.859
Go ahead and take
off the bandana.
Ok.

21:06.364 --> 21:10.934
A piano! Oh, my gosh!
It looks just like the one
I had when I was a kid!

21:10.935 --> 21:13.336
It is the one
you had as a kid.
No!

21:13.337 --> 21:16.140
You couldn't have!
How could you do this?
It was a mess.

21:16.141 --> 21:19.309
Well, not as big a mess
as your cousin henry.

21:22.847 --> 21:26.016
We spent two weeks restoring it
in wilson's garage.

21:26.017 --> 21:29.453
Yeah. We would've had it done
in a week except dad kept on
playing with the train.

21:29.454 --> 21:32.723
Oh, I love it so much.

21:32.724 --> 21:35.358
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, honey.
Happy birthday.

21:35.359 --> 21:38.995
And honey!
And honey!
And honey!

21:38.996 --> 21:40.163
Woo!

21:40.164 --> 21:43.200
Let me see, what do I remember?
Um... Ok.

21:43.201 --> 21:45.202
<i>(♪ "für elise" by beethoven)</i>

21:47.371 --> 21:49.505
<i>(plays off key)</i>

21:56.847 --> 21:59.716
I wonder how long
it would take to turn it
back into an aquarium.

22:03.855 --> 22:07.257
Let's clean up.
It'll be the best party
we ever gave her.

22:07.258 --> 22:09.192
You think she
suspects anything?

22:09.193 --> 22:12.429
I think that having
the party two weeks before
the real thing...

22:12.430 --> 22:14.831
<i>(indistinct)</i>

22:16.701 --> 22:20.204
Whose idea was it for everybody
to bring their favorite dish?

22:20.205 --> 22:22.372
Mine.

22:22.373 --> 22:25.876
I'm sick and tired
of your insolence, boys.

22:37.021 --> 22:39.923
Dad... <i>(laughs)</i>
