WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:02.281
It sounds like PTSD psychosis.

00:02.328 --> 00:06.046
The memory replays like a hallucination.

00:06.125 --> 00:08.159
So, she's somewhere else,

00:08.194 --> 00:11.228
and she's stabbing someone else.

00:14.734 --> 00:16.267
Heroin.

00:16.302 --> 00:18.402
I would sleep with guys for fixes.

00:18.438 --> 00:19.437
<i>Cora's my wife.</i>

00:19.472 --> 00:20.771
What did you do to her?

00:20.807 --> 00:22.440
You don't know shit, do you?

00:24.644 --> 00:26.277
Cora.

00:26.312 --> 00:28.245
God doesn't listen.

00:30.450 --> 00:32.817
<i>She disappeared in July</i>

00:32.852 --> 00:35.219
2012, but two months later,

00:35.254 --> 00:36.554
she turned up out of nowhere

00:36.589 --> 00:39.090
at a detox center in Poughkeepsie.

00:39.125 --> 00:41.292
I want you to show me how you shoot up.

00:43.262 --> 00:45.329
You don't know how to do it, do you?

00:45.364 --> 00:47.565
It's not true... none of that,

00:47.600 --> 00:50.735
that you thought
you went through, was true.

00:51.904 --> 00:53.771
Then what happened to me?

00:54.472 --> 00:56.674
How are you feeling today, Cora?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:17.897 --> 01:21.132
<i>Look, all I did was sit down
and try to talk to this guy.</i>

01:21.167 --> 01:24.135
And then out of nowhere,
he comes and he attacks me.

01:24.170 --> 01:25.870
And he's like this.

01:25.905 --> 01:27.638
The guy is like this.
He's done it before.

01:27.673 --> 01:30.025
All witnesses at the bar
say that you provoked him.

01:30.050 --> 01:31.026
No...

01:31.051 --> 01:33.144
This guy did something to my wife.

01:33.179 --> 01:36.986
Okay? This whole thing
is because of him.

01:37.483 --> 01:39.717
So, do you know Cora Tannetti?

01:41.921 --> 01:43.788
Yeah, from the news.

01:43.823 --> 01:47.713
So... you've never had direct contact

01:47.752 --> 01:49.460
with Mrs. Tannetti.

01:51.197 --> 01:52.496
Well, I wish I did.

01:52.532 --> 01:54.532
She seems like a fascinating woman.

01:54.567 --> 01:56.300
He is a drug dealer, okay?

01:56.335 --> 01:58.803
He deals cocaine. He deals heroin.

01:58.838 --> 02:00.604
I don't understand. Just charge him,

02:00.640 --> 02:02.606
and then you get him to talk about Cora.

02:05.397 --> 02:09.094
They know each other, okay?
They know each other.

02:09.215 --> 02:12.577
Cora told you his name,
the car that he drives...

02:12.852 --> 02:14.585
It's him.

02:14.866 --> 02:17.888
How did you know she told us that?

02:18.220 --> 02:20.470
Ah, shit.

02:20.860 --> 02:23.010
That thing you said to her husband...

02:23.080 --> 02:27.231
Yeah, she, uh, "still like
three guys at once?"

02:27.266 --> 02:28.599
<i>Right.</i>

02:28.634 --> 02:30.501
That's an odd thing to say,

02:30.536 --> 02:33.000
considering you've never met her.

02:33.212 --> 02:34.979
I was inspired.

02:36.843 --> 02:38.679
Women inspire me.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.304
You know what the real odd thing is?

02:42.715 --> 02:44.582
Cora Tannetti mentioned your name.

02:48.654 --> 02:52.456
Well, she's not exactly
the most reliable source, is she?

02:54.861 --> 02:56.832
That's good.

03:01.934 --> 03:05.120
This is Mr. Lambert's lawyer,
Mr. Harding.

03:05.404 --> 03:08.272
I don't understand why
my client was held overnight.

03:08.307 --> 03:10.808
You realize he suffers
from Lyme disease?

03:10.843 --> 03:12.810
That's a health hazard.

03:12.845 --> 03:14.612
We're done here, pretty much, anyway.

03:14.647 --> 03:15.946
He's all yours.

03:19.552 --> 03:21.418
The lawyer... you know this guy?

03:21.454 --> 03:24.388
Hedge-fund type runs over a pedestrian,

03:24.413 --> 03:26.013
he comes and defends him.

03:26.356 --> 03:28.949
"Scumbag millionaire" is his thing.

03:28.985 --> 03:31.290
So, JD brings a gun to a knife fight.

03:33.089 --> 03:34.755
More like a cannon.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.423
Piece of shit.

03:41.314 --> 03:43.814
Um, Lieutenant Ambrose, I...

03:45.618 --> 03:49.931
I misjudged which information
should and should not...

03:50.456 --> 03:54.103
be shared with Mason Tannetti,
and I'm really sorry.

03:54.627 --> 03:57.495
Personal relationships
can't interfere with work.

03:59.732 --> 04:01.465
You know that.

04:01.501 --> 04:02.700
Yes, sir.

04:05.638 --> 04:07.638
Just make sure he keeps his head down.

04:09.842 --> 04:12.121
Yes, sir.

04:35.868 --> 04:37.635
You know my favorite thing

04:37.670 --> 04:40.538
about our dear neighbor
Kevin's girlfriend?

04:42.108 --> 04:44.534
I've seen her with another boy.

04:44.811 --> 04:46.784
Drops her off down the block...

04:46.913 --> 04:49.026
and then she walks over to Kevin's.

04:49.148 --> 04:51.482
She's a shameless harlot.

04:57.757 --> 05:00.358
- You know what that means?
- Stop.

05:02.729 --> 05:04.975
Kevin's fair game.

05:05.631 --> 05:08.699
And I could watch it all from here.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.509
Cora...

05:15.775 --> 05:18.126
you won't even think about it?

05:28.397 --> 05:29.839
<i>How 'bout that?</i>

05:32.492 --> 05:34.725
Her boobs are weird.

05:34.761 --> 05:36.927
How is anybody supposed to
actually want that?

05:36.963 --> 05:39.497
If you weren't such a prude,

05:39.532 --> 05:42.500
- maybe you'd find out.
- You're so mean sometimes.

05:42.535 --> 05:45.222
Hmm. You're annoying.

05:45.438 --> 05:48.698
You can go out, do anything you want.

05:48.975 --> 05:51.542
But you'd rather stay home
and pretend you're a nun.

06:24.544 --> 06:26.330
I'm sorry.

06:27.046 --> 06:29.239
I didn't know how to tell you.

06:32.919 --> 06:34.739
Is Mason right?

06:35.121 --> 06:37.721
Is JD Lambert part of this?

06:42.929 --> 06:44.462
Cora, you're gonna have to trust me

06:44.497 --> 06:45.763
if I'm gonna help you.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.734
I lost my virginity to him.

06:52.939 --> 06:54.538
Did he ever hurt you?

06:58.111 --> 06:59.984
I don't think so.

07:00.646 --> 07:02.947
Is he the one that shot you up?

07:05.051 --> 07:08.018
No, we did drugs together,
but not heroin.

07:11.924 --> 07:14.625
He was the one I was with
on 4th of July weekend.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.598
<i>He was the blond guy at Carl's Taproom.</i>

07:22.168 --> 07:24.802
So there was no pregnancy,
no suicide attempt...

07:24.837 --> 07:26.137
there was no Frankie.

07:26.172 --> 07:29.540
There was just... JD Lambert

07:29.575 --> 07:31.942
<i>at that bar, that night.</i>

07:32.845 --> 07:34.078
And then...

07:36.082 --> 07:38.436
We drove to somebody's house.

07:38.885 --> 07:40.818
Like I told you.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.427
What happened there?

07:59.839 --> 08:02.506
I had sex. I-I don't know who with.

08:07.113 --> 08:10.437
And... and then it just all goes blank.

08:10.917 --> 08:13.784
What's the next thing you do remember?

08:15.188 --> 08:17.575
Waking up in the street.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.880
In Poughkeepsie?

08:20.193 --> 08:22.395
Two months later?

08:22.995 --> 08:25.062
Holy shit.

08:27.099 --> 08:29.567
Why can't I remember?

08:36.477 --> 08:39.212
Hi, Dr. Chang.

08:39.246 --> 08:41.547
What do I have to do
to hear back from you?

08:41.582 --> 08:43.349
Hi.

08:43.541 --> 08:44.807
I got your voicemails.

08:44.861 --> 08:46.795
Oh, good.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.863
- And so...
- Look.

08:49.009 --> 08:51.433
When you start bringing in
fringe psychology

08:51.468 --> 08:53.435
like hypnosis and recovered memories

08:53.470 --> 08:56.304
into a case,
judges just roll their eyes.

08:56.339 --> 08:58.606
So, I'm not sure what your angle is.

08:58.642 --> 09:00.642
But you did that memory recovery stuff

09:00.677 --> 09:02.610
back at Berkeley, didn't you?

09:03.680 --> 09:06.446
Sometimes, real memories are recovered.

09:06.616 --> 09:09.368
Sometimes, it's just
the patient's imagination.

09:09.519 --> 09:11.321
We can't tell the difference.

09:11.588 --> 09:14.689
Look, Cora Tannetti has
some very significant trauma

09:14.724 --> 09:16.357
that she can't remember.

09:16.393 --> 09:18.460
And it's in there.
It's in there somewhere.

09:20.630 --> 09:22.702
I don't work with people
who are unstable.

09:22.799 --> 09:24.666
They can get retraumatized.

09:25.735 --> 09:27.826
You know her case.

09:28.371 --> 09:31.381
She's got nothing else going for her.

09:31.741 --> 09:33.451
Right?

09:34.244 --> 09:35.844
Okay.

09:37.447 --> 09:40.686
Talk to her today. Let's get it started.

09:58.568 --> 09:59.734
Hey.

10:00.313 --> 10:01.970
Hey.

10:02.439 --> 10:04.339
Detective Ambrose told me
what happened last night.

10:04.374 --> 10:05.860
Are you all right?

10:05.942 --> 10:07.308
Yeah.

10:07.344 --> 10:08.956
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:09.279 --> 10:11.113
<i>So, you and JD talked.</i>

10:11.414 --> 10:12.614
Yeah.

10:16.653 --> 10:18.953
We dated for a few months
before I met you.

10:18.989 --> 10:21.756
That's all that it was,
and I didn't tell you

10:21.791 --> 10:25.760
because maybe... he did something to me.

10:25.795 --> 10:27.595
I just... I'm not sure,

10:27.631 --> 10:29.430
and I can't remember.

10:31.001 --> 10:33.397
What do you mean, you can't remember?

10:33.670 --> 10:35.921
<i>I-I-I just can't.</i>

10:36.039 --> 10:37.839
I'm trying.

10:39.543 --> 10:41.476
Detective Ambrose is trying
to figure it out.

10:41.511 --> 10:44.294
<i>Cora, why are you talking to him?</i>

10:44.748 --> 10:46.802
These cops don't give a shit about you.

10:46.850 --> 10:49.654
Trust me, all they wanna do
is put you away.

10:50.086 --> 10:52.020
No, no. He's helping me.

10:52.055 --> 10:54.055
<i>No, that's what he's telling you.</i>

10:54.090 --> 10:55.823
But he's sitting on JD,
and he's gonna turn on you.

10:55.859 --> 10:58.098
I know how these guys are.

10:58.461 --> 10:59.738
Just...

11:00.330 --> 11:03.826
Just, you can't...
you can't say anything to them.

11:05.001 --> 11:07.021
<i>You understand?</i>

11:13.977 --> 11:15.443
Oh...

11:17.447 --> 11:19.026
You all right?

11:19.190 --> 11:21.716
Yeah... I just left my glasses.

11:21.751 --> 11:23.351
It's fine.

11:27.524 --> 11:30.513
Oh, look at this!

11:30.911 --> 11:33.477
Is this how you remember it?

11:35.799 --> 11:38.344
It's nice of you to bring me here.

11:38.868 --> 11:40.668
Thank you.

11:42.314 --> 11:44.872
I was trying to remember
the first time we came here.

11:46.042 --> 11:48.543
You were driving back from White Plains.

11:48.578 --> 11:50.645
Hmm, right.

11:51.735 --> 11:53.735
After we found out about the baby.

11:53.950 --> 11:55.783
About Mel.

11:58.955 --> 12:00.021
Oh...

12:02.951 --> 12:04.817
Right.

12:05.061 --> 12:08.588
You saw this place, you pulled in.

12:08.832 --> 12:10.598
You sat me in the sun.

12:12.135 --> 12:14.541
You ordered lobster.

12:15.405 --> 12:17.807
You knew exactly what I needed.

12:18.508 --> 12:20.508
And then, you said...

12:22.746 --> 12:25.588
"When you're ready, we can try again."

12:29.085 --> 12:31.552
I'm sorry I didn't remember that.

12:34.124 --> 12:35.690
It's all right.

12:40.736 --> 12:42.971
Two sessions, a few days apart,

12:42.999 --> 12:44.643
so you can recover.

12:44.768 --> 12:46.658
That's all I've got.

12:48.772 --> 12:50.872
Detective Ambrose requested this?

12:50.907 --> 12:52.573
Yes.

12:52.609 --> 12:54.742
He also wants transcripts
of the sessions,

12:54.778 --> 12:57.096
which requires your consent.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.080
Personally, I don't recommend
any of this.

13:00.150 --> 13:03.510
Revisiting trauma can be destabilizing.

13:06.056 --> 13:07.565
I wanna try it.

13:14.798 --> 13:16.898
This is like a guided meditation.

13:22.939 --> 13:25.139
I'm going to be talking
to you throughout.

13:28.478 --> 13:31.424
You just let the images come to you...

13:31.715 --> 13:34.015
and we'll see what happens.

13:42.602 --> 13:45.670
Okay. Close your eyes.

13:50.867 --> 13:53.064
Deep breath in.

13:54.104 --> 13:55.970
Let it out.

13:56.973 --> 14:01.042
In... out.

14:03.146 --> 14:06.514
Imagine you're standing
on the edge of a body of water.

14:09.786 --> 14:11.753
<i>I'm going to count down from ten.</i>

14:11.788 --> 14:13.254
<i>As I do,</i>

14:13.330 --> 14:15.746
<i>you're going to walk into the water.</i>

14:16.559 --> 14:18.028
<i>Ten...</i>

14:18.228 --> 14:19.856
<i>nine...</i>

14:20.096 --> 14:22.442
<i>The water is warm at your feet.</i>

14:22.999 --> 14:24.739
<i>Eight...</i>

14:24.901 --> 14:26.551
<i>seven...</i>

14:26.703 --> 14:30.083
<i>six... you're descending deeper.</i>

14:30.206 --> 14:31.708
<i>Five...</i>

14:31.841 --> 14:33.141
<i>four...</i>

14:33.186 --> 14:34.700
<i>You're almost in.</i>

14:34.811 --> 14:36.751
<i>Three...</i>

14:36.913 --> 14:39.847
<i>two... you can breathe.</i>

14:39.883 --> 14:42.049
You're safe.

14:43.495 --> 14:44.987
Now...

14:45.588 --> 14:50.725
let the first memory
of July 3, 2012 come to you.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.897
What do you see?

14:58.368 --> 15:00.923
<i>I think it's a water tower...</i>

15:01.257 --> 15:04.048
<i>in the distance, on the top of a hill.</i>

15:04.808 --> 15:06.705
<i>Where are you?</i>

15:06.976 --> 15:09.283
<i>I can't move my feet.</i>

15:09.612 --> 15:11.510
<i>I'm stuck.</i>

15:11.648 --> 15:15.299
<i>It's like a... a swamp</i>

15:15.752 --> 15:17.955
<i>in the woods or something.</i>

15:18.254 --> 15:20.447
<i>How do you feel in this place?</i>

15:20.590 --> 15:22.905
Hopeless.

15:23.726 --> 15:25.226
Like I may never get out.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.663
Okay. Let's move on.

15:30.233 --> 15:33.473
Let's go to a moment
that you enjoyed that night.

15:33.970 --> 15:36.520
Try to find a moment of pleasure.

15:41.587 --> 15:43.653
I'm kissing JD.

15:43.947 --> 15:45.874
And?

15:46.282 --> 15:49.460
And he tastes like gasoline.

15:49.686 --> 15:52.176
<i>Where are you?</i>

15:52.278 --> 15:55.323
<i>We're at the bar... at the Taproom.</i>

16:10.462 --> 16:12.253
<i>That's right...</i>

16:12.887 --> 16:14.614
<i>she's there too.</i>

16:14.978 --> 16:17.502
<i>- Who?
- Maddie,</i>

16:17.780 --> 16:19.673
<i>JD's ex.</i>

16:20.917 --> 16:22.116
<i>She hates me.</i>

16:24.053 --> 16:25.688
Why?

16:25.922 --> 16:27.355
Because of him.

16:28.958 --> 16:31.555
<i>JD has... has a plan.</i>

16:31.728 --> 16:33.617
<i>And she's in on it.</i>

16:33.696 --> 16:35.007
<i>What's the plan?</i>

16:35.194 --> 16:37.507
<i>I don't know. They're not telling me.</i>

17:03.102 --> 17:05.358
<i>I'm confused. Now I'm...</i>

17:05.453 --> 17:09.931
<i>waiting for the bus,
and I'm... I'm a kid.</i>

17:11.334 --> 17:13.195
It left me.

17:14.069 --> 17:16.056
I'm... I'm sorry.

17:16.204 --> 17:19.095
I-I-I'm not sure why this is coming up.

17:19.165 --> 17:20.751
It's okay.

17:20.810 --> 17:23.044
The mind makes associations,
like in a dream.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.795
It doesn't always make sense.

17:26.148 --> 17:27.949
Try going back to that night.

17:37.293 --> 17:39.880
Oh, gasoline...

17:41.297 --> 17:44.997
<i>Oh, they're siphoning gas
because JD's on empty.</i>

17:45.902 --> 17:48.269
<i>He always keeps a gas can
behind the front seat</i>

17:48.304 --> 17:50.831
<i>of his car... it always
rattles when he drives.</i>

17:50.974 --> 17:53.174
<i>Where are you going?</i>

17:53.209 --> 17:54.742
<i>I don't know.</i>

17:54.777 --> 17:57.845
Oh, I shouldn't go.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.747
Shouldn't? Why?

17:59.782 --> 18:02.711
I know what you're doing,
so you can just stop.

18:02.986 --> 18:04.418
What am I doing?

18:04.454 --> 18:06.258
You're trying to get rid of me.

18:06.297 --> 18:09.142
And then you're just gonna
go meet up with him anyway.

18:09.359 --> 18:11.650
You want me to die.

18:12.261 --> 18:14.095
Something's wrong with her.

18:14.130 --> 18:15.822
Cora!

18:15.965 --> 18:17.431
<i>Why won't you go to her?</i>

18:17.467 --> 18:20.279
Cora!

18:20.470 --> 18:22.475
Because I hate her.

18:22.857 --> 18:24.920
I wanna...

18:25.241 --> 18:27.428
hold her under water.

18:27.944 --> 18:30.684
And I wanna break her into pieces.

18:30.793 --> 18:32.092
<i>Why?</i>

18:33.783 --> 18:35.316
Because she won't let me go.

18:40.006 --> 18:43.008
That's Madeline Beecham.
She's 21 years old.

18:43.054 --> 18:44.653
No current address.

18:44.681 --> 18:47.782
And she's mentioned in JD's vice file,

18:47.917 --> 18:51.018
because her landlord reported a theft

18:51.054 --> 18:53.087
and blamed JD and Madeline,

18:53.122 --> 18:55.222
also known as Maddie.

18:57.694 --> 18:59.093
Okay, and?

18:59.128 --> 19:00.691
And...

19:00.830 --> 19:02.663
we're tracking down the landlord.

19:02.699 --> 19:04.832
But from what Cora said in her session,

19:04.867 --> 19:07.101
on July 3, 2012,

19:07.136 --> 19:09.136
she started out at Carl's Taproom.

19:09.172 --> 19:12.907
This we knew, right?
But she was with JD and Maddie.

19:12.942 --> 19:14.842
They siphoned gas into this can

19:14.877 --> 19:16.944
that he keeps behind
his front seat, right?

19:16.979 --> 19:18.679
It's one of those emergency things...

19:18.715 --> 19:19.947
A thin one that looks like a briefcase.

19:19.982 --> 19:21.682
How many gallons does that hold?

19:21.718 --> 19:23.768
One gallon worth of gas.

19:23.886 --> 19:26.323
JD drives a 1983 SUV...

19:26.432 --> 19:28.556
14 miles a gallon, tops.

19:28.591 --> 19:32.960
Okay, so 14 miles
in any direction from that bar,

19:32.995 --> 19:35.987
and their second destination
that night...

19:36.265 --> 19:39.698
is somewhere inside that circle.

19:40.036 --> 19:41.535
Okay?

19:41.571 --> 19:43.237
Now, Cora said that she remembers

19:43.272 --> 19:45.072
a water tower in the woods.

19:45.108 --> 19:47.833
There are two water towers
inside that circle.

19:48.244 --> 19:50.277
And the one in the woods is right there.

19:52.682 --> 19:56.751
The, um, the shrink said
that these memories are real...

19:56.859 --> 19:59.120
- all of it.
- Yeah.

20:00.823 --> 20:03.382
Okay, some of them. Uh...

20:03.726 --> 20:05.896
hopefully, so...

20:06.062 --> 20:07.388
Shall we go?

20:07.476 --> 20:09.830
So, she has this memory... maybe.

20:09.866 --> 20:11.565
- Right.
- Of a water tower.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.033
Maybe of a night

20:13.069 --> 20:15.062
where maybe something happens to her

20:15.087 --> 20:17.328
that maybe made her kill some dude.

20:19.208 --> 20:22.109
I'm not getting Lyme disease
from all these maybes,

20:22.145 --> 20:25.899
so you can pick me up after you do it.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.224
- There you go.
- Thank you.

22:04.413 --> 22:07.082
Hey. Is JD in?

22:08.113 --> 22:10.918
He's not here.
He won't be back till tonight.

22:10.953 --> 22:12.386
Oh...

22:12.421 --> 22:13.727
Did you text him?

22:13.767 --> 22:17.068
Nah... shit. That was stupid.

22:17.204 --> 22:20.114
- Who are you?
- Oh, sorry. I'm Mike.

22:20.778 --> 22:23.263
I know JD through Jordan
and his girlfriend.

22:24.967 --> 22:27.901
Well, listen, um...
I was heading out of town,

22:27.937 --> 22:30.737
and I was hoping to pick up
some supplies

22:30.773 --> 22:32.697
before I left. I don't know...

22:33.042 --> 22:35.676
if that's anything
you can help me with, or...

22:36.979 --> 22:39.279
I'm just trying to beat the traffic.

22:39.315 --> 22:41.815
It's a little hard.

22:45.221 --> 22:47.754
Great. Well, thanks.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.823
- Smells good.
- Thanks.

22:49.859 --> 22:53.026
- So, how do you know Jordan?
- You know,

22:53.062 --> 22:55.796
I forgot how.
Just from around, you know.

22:55.831 --> 22:57.297
We know a lot of the same people.

22:57.333 --> 23:01.835
- In common.
- So, what exactly did you want?

23:01.987 --> 23:05.321
Oh, yeah, just blow.
You know, maybe... three?

23:05.373 --> 23:06.807
If you got it.

23:06.842 --> 23:09.376
- Okay, Stay here.
- No problem.

23:18.454 --> 23:20.940
So, you grew up here too?

23:21.924 --> 23:24.440
- Yeah, in Dorchester.
- Huh.

23:25.794 --> 23:28.195
Are you sure we never met?
You look really familiar.

23:31.734 --> 23:35.359
No... I mean, I don't go out
much or anything, so...

23:35.430 --> 23:38.016
Yeah, me neither, since the baby.

23:38.140 --> 23:40.073
Oh, yeah, right.

23:42.011 --> 23:44.745
- Ah.
- That'll be 250.

23:45.981 --> 23:48.091
No problem.

23:48.417 --> 23:51.161
Hey, babe. I texted you.

23:51.186 --> 23:52.886
Your friend Mike's here.

23:52.929 --> 23:56.318
<i>Mike? Like, rocking chair Mike from...</i>

23:56.458 --> 23:59.490
Uh, no, Jordan's friend.

24:02.131 --> 24:03.997
<i>So, I don't know who the
hell's in our house, but...</i>

24:05.620 --> 24:07.897
Get over here now.

24:08.597 --> 24:09.662
Who are you?

24:09.718 --> 24:12.351
I-I told you, I'm Mike.
You know, I'm friends with Jordan.

24:12.398 --> 24:13.874
- What do you want?
- Nothing... here.

24:13.909 --> 24:15.309
- Here's your money.
- Put it on the table!

24:15.344 --> 24:17.144
- On the table.
- Okay. It's all there.

24:17.179 --> 24:18.676
No problem.

24:18.781 --> 24:20.145
Get out!

24:20.282 --> 24:22.254
Get out! Get out of my house!

24:22.341 --> 24:24.318
Okay. It's all good.

24:24.395 --> 24:25.786
Sorry.

24:29.091 --> 24:31.058
<i>So, you knew both Maddie and JD.</i>

24:31.093 --> 24:32.125
<i>I did.</i>

24:32.161 --> 24:34.027
She rented the back house

24:34.063 --> 24:35.996
for about six months.

24:36.031 --> 24:37.831
You pressed charges against them both

24:37.866 --> 24:40.294
and dropped them. Why?

24:40.502 --> 24:44.044
I decided I wanted to be done
with the whole thing.

24:44.273 --> 24:47.088
So, you knew Maddie...

24:47.376 --> 24:50.174
a little better than you knew JD.

24:50.813 --> 24:53.807
She would come over, knocking...

24:53.908 --> 24:56.383
in tears, late at night...

24:56.534 --> 24:58.554
wanting advice.

24:58.887 --> 25:00.153
I took an interest.

25:02.358 --> 25:04.491
So, how much of an interest?

25:06.395 --> 25:08.394
We became involved.

25:08.998 --> 25:11.031
I wasn't looking for it.

25:12.835 --> 25:14.965
And JD?

25:15.537 --> 25:19.253
They... told me that...

25:19.475 --> 25:21.675
polyamory was their thing.

25:22.801 --> 25:24.542
And I believed them.

25:26.015 --> 25:29.016
Did they fleece someone new?

25:32.521 --> 25:34.855
This is a murder investigation.

25:36.158 --> 25:37.911
Did he kill her?

25:38.060 --> 25:40.445
- Why do you ask?
- Uh...

25:40.562 --> 25:43.445
he had this control over her.

25:43.899 --> 25:48.437
When I said to Maddie I thought
maybe JD had stolen my things,

25:48.904 --> 25:50.948
she panicked.

25:51.073 --> 25:53.173
She cried,

25:53.456 --> 25:55.475
she begged me not to confront him.

25:57.479 --> 25:59.753
A few weeks later, she was gone.

25:59.982 --> 26:03.444
- Moved out?
- No, she was gone.

26:03.585 --> 26:06.428
But her makeup,
her clothes, her jewelry...

26:06.555 --> 26:09.319
she left them. She left them all.

26:09.925 --> 26:11.600
And when was this?

26:12.061 --> 26:13.827
2012.

26:15.297 --> 26:16.897
4th of July weekend.

26:41.098 --> 26:42.364
What's going on?

26:49.855 --> 26:51.463
What are you doing? I don't want this.

26:51.496 --> 26:52.762
- Listen... I bought it...
- Put that way. Put that away!

26:52.791 --> 26:53.894
I bought it from his girlfriend.

26:53.902 --> 26:55.235
Her prints are all over it,

26:55.260 --> 26:56.993
and I recorded the whole conversation.

26:57.028 --> 26:59.710
You can arrest her, or him,
or something.

27:01.276 --> 27:03.077
I should've known better.

27:03.195 --> 27:04.595
What are you talking about?

27:04.630 --> 27:05.796
This is what you do.

27:05.831 --> 27:07.431
You use people.

27:11.403 --> 27:13.467
Yeah, it's even worse
if you don't remember.

27:14.306 --> 27:16.173
Caitlyn, what do you mean?
I wasn't using you.

27:16.208 --> 27:17.874
You... it...

27:18.131 --> 27:19.306
We were having fun.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.431
You screwed me in the photo lab,
and then you wouldn't

27:21.493 --> 27:23.142
look at me in public.

27:23.449 --> 27:25.816
So, no... no, that wasn't fun.

27:30.289 --> 27:33.164
This is some crazy
illegal shit you're pulling.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.375
Okay? You could get...

27:35.628 --> 27:36.860
You could get me fired,

27:36.895 --> 27:39.326
and get yourself killed, so just...

27:39.698 --> 27:41.231
stop.

28:10.529 --> 28:12.334
I'm your neighbor.

28:13.332 --> 28:15.293
Yeah, I know.

28:15.981 --> 28:17.524
So?

28:23.647 --> 28:26.124
I was wondering about something.

28:42.818 --> 28:44.372
Well?

28:45.121 --> 28:46.754
Go ahead.

29:21.487 --> 29:22.886
I had two orgasms.

29:27.693 --> 29:29.560
Tell me everything.

29:32.091 --> 29:33.114
So...

29:41.040 --> 29:42.829
Hi, Cora.

29:43.227 --> 29:46.180
Detective Ambrose would like
to sit in this session.

29:46.274 --> 29:47.736
I have made it clear I don't approve,

29:47.780 --> 29:49.713
but ultimately, the choice is yours.

29:50.883 --> 29:53.417
You gave us some good
pieces of the puzzle

29:53.452 --> 29:55.118
last time, and I thought
if I could be here,

29:55.154 --> 29:59.045
maybe I could... head us
to some of the missing pieces.

30:01.961 --> 30:03.660
You don't need to be polite.

30:09.630 --> 30:12.747
It's just... private.

30:13.490 --> 30:16.872
I don't know what we're gonna find
when we do this, and...

30:17.009 --> 30:19.255
you could use it against me.

30:19.945 --> 30:21.512
I'm on your side.

30:21.547 --> 30:24.702
I... think I proved that already.

30:26.252 --> 30:28.038
Why do you care so much?

30:28.153 --> 30:30.640
It's just, I can...

30:31.190 --> 30:33.789
see some light at the end of all this,

30:33.893 --> 30:36.660
if you just... trust me.

30:38.964 --> 30:40.745
No.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.339
It's not good enough.

30:43.769 --> 30:46.837
I am showing you everything.

30:48.841 --> 30:51.108
You at least have to tell me why.

30:52.745 --> 30:54.244
Um...

30:59.118 --> 31:01.386
Maybe it's that swamp.

31:01.820 --> 31:04.688
You know, that you described
your last session.

31:04.723 --> 31:06.800
I...

31:07.192 --> 31:10.160
how you felt like you were
gonna be stuck there forever.

31:14.033 --> 31:16.233
I know that swamp.

31:21.874 --> 31:23.663
Okay.

31:23.842 --> 31:26.310
Any comments you want to make,
you write them down.

31:26.345 --> 31:27.678
No talking.

31:29.348 --> 31:30.948
Sure.

31:36.889 --> 31:38.591
Exhale.

31:39.825 --> 31:43.058
You're standing at the edge
of a body of water.

31:43.362 --> 31:45.285
Ten...

31:45.631 --> 31:47.363

31:47.633 --> 31:48.964
eight...

31:49.134 --> 31:50.863
seven...

31:51.103 --> 31:54.236
six... five...

31:54.406 --> 31:57.341
Feel the water hold
you up as you sink deeper.

32:02.742 --> 32:07.498

32:12.404 --> 32:16.253

32:16.303 --> 32:18.380

32:18.539 --> 32:20.818
<i>Maddie's touching me.</i>

32:21.075 --> 32:22.380
Where are you?

32:22.443 --> 32:26.029

- I'm on the dance floor.

32:41.295 --> 32:43.159
<i>in the truck.</i>

32:43.971 --> 32:45.897
Why don't you want to go?

32:47.601 --> 32:49.401
Because something
horrible's gonna happen,

32:49.436 --> 32:50.602
I can feel it.

32:53.307 --> 32:55.140
Where are they going?

32:56.110 --> 32:57.576
I'm not sure.

33:02.015 --> 33:04.249
I can't breathe... my heart...

33:04.284 --> 33:05.584
Okay, okay.

33:05.619 --> 33:07.486
You're okay. Everything's okay.

33:07.521 --> 33:09.020
They poisoned me.

33:10.224 --> 33:11.857
Can I go home now?

33:11.892 --> 33:13.793
What...

33:13.983 --> 33:15.739
What's that?

33:17.264 --> 33:19.131
It's a... it's a searchlight.

33:20.901 --> 33:22.347
They're looking for us.

33:22.436 --> 33:24.002
How did you get that...

33:26.640 --> 33:29.141
Who? Can you see them?

33:29.176 --> 33:30.242
Come on.

33:31.345 --> 33:32.611
They're hunting us.

33:34.648 --> 33:36.381
Why are they hunting you?

33:37.859 --> 33:39.551
<i>I don't know.</i>

33:39.586 --> 33:41.319
Something we did.

33:43.457 --> 33:45.390
I don't... I don't understand

33:45.426 --> 33:46.968
what's happening.

33:47.127 --> 33:49.007
It's the school bus again.

33:49.229 --> 33:51.329
The same school bus as before?

33:51.365 --> 33:52.664
- Yeah, and it's...
- Don't worry about

33:52.699 --> 33:54.169
the school bus. Just, just...

33:54.268 --> 33:55.600
where did you go with Maddie?

33:59.139 --> 34:00.568
Are you coming?

34:00.697 --> 34:02.163
She wants me to come...

34:02.409 --> 34:03.575
to the basement.

34:03.610 --> 34:05.310
Where are you?

34:05.345 --> 34:06.645
Um...

34:06.944 --> 34:09.436
I'm in the house, I think.

34:09.983 --> 34:11.917
Where we drove to from the bar.

34:18.192 --> 34:19.543
What are you feeling?

34:19.626 --> 34:23.195
It's the song... from the beach.

34:23.230 --> 34:25.996
Okay. Let's just ease off.

34:26.033 --> 34:27.998
<i>♪ Pushing and shoving ♪</i>

34:28.054 --> 34:30.168
<i>♪ Hugging and kissing ♪</i>

34:32.306 --> 34:35.172
- I don't wanna do this anymore!
- You can, you can.

34:35.208 --> 34:37.042
You're right there. You're right there.

34:37.085 --> 34:39.494
Just a little bit closer.

34:39.540 --> 34:42.380
Just... a little bit more.

34:51.291 --> 34:52.556
<i>There's a light</i>

34:52.592 --> 34:54.882
<i>at the bottom of the stairway.</i>

34:55.295 --> 34:56.428
<i>Go down there.</i>

34:57.998 --> 34:59.429
I don't wanna go.

34:59.535 --> 35:01.435
That's what you did, though, isn't it?

35:06.340 --> 35:08.540
I'm sick. I feel sick.

35:08.575 --> 35:10.442
- Just stay with it.
- We need to stop this,

35:10.477 --> 35:11.974
<i>right now.</i>

35:12.171 --> 35:13.637
<i>I don't wanna do it.</i>

35:13.680 --> 35:15.247
<i>- I can't do it anymore.
- You can.</i>

35:15.282 --> 35:17.082
I can't do it anymore.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.221
<i>Push through.</i>

35:25.526 --> 35:28.360
Just breathe right now.

35:28.395 --> 35:30.529
Focus on the breath.

35:30.785 --> 35:33.222
Easy.

35:33.699 --> 35:36.134
You have to go now.

35:43.277 --> 35:45.343
So, you have no idea who he is.

35:47.347 --> 35:49.781
No. No, he's wearing a mask,

35:49.816 --> 35:51.750
and it's covering his whole head.

35:53.253 --> 35:55.454
And there was this wallpaper...

35:55.622 --> 35:57.845
Old-fashioned, like...

35:57.991 --> 36:01.026
like the design on a...
on a dollar bill.

36:01.061 --> 36:05.003
And it's everywhere. It's on every wall.

36:05.132 --> 36:07.132
So, the...

36:07.157 --> 36:10.068
wallpaper, guy in the mask...

36:10.103 --> 36:12.818
that's everything. Nothing else.

36:13.032 --> 36:15.427
Yeah, that's it.

36:23.158 --> 36:25.483
Do you treat everybody like this,
or is it just me?

36:27.688 --> 36:29.688
- What?
- I am trying to answer

36:29.723 --> 36:32.090
all your questions.
I'm spilling my guts.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.458
And you just...

36:33.531 --> 36:35.660
act like nothing is good enough.

36:37.764 --> 36:39.831
Look, uh...

36:43.070 --> 36:45.456
I appreciate the...

36:48.108 --> 36:50.573
You're being very candid, and...

36:51.278 --> 36:53.712
I know, I...

36:56.583 --> 36:58.283
So, I thank you.

37:02.055 --> 37:03.421
And you're married?

37:07.294 --> 37:08.526
Trying.

37:16.603 --> 37:18.518
Please don't give up on me.

37:24.411 --> 37:25.644
I won't.

37:41.216 --> 37:43.050
13 A.

37:43.085 --> 37:45.405
All right. Come on.

38:16.593 --> 38:18.459
What are you doing up?
Are you all right?

38:18.528 --> 38:20.965
Don't go over there, Dad.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.262
Well, Dede called.

38:23.359 --> 38:24.902
Water's pouring out from under the sink

38:24.927 --> 38:26.620
and she can't figure out
how to turn it off.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.329
Please?

38:30.366 --> 38:31.996
Don't go.

38:35.404 --> 38:36.842
Go to sleep.

38:37.521 --> 38:39.273
This is nothing to get upset over.

38:50.553 --> 38:55.442
I was thinking we could
keep our separate lives.

38:55.551 --> 38:57.291
- Uh-huh.
- You know?

38:57.326 --> 39:00.325
Do the things we want to do...
our own things.

39:00.596 --> 39:03.330
- Uh-huh.
- And...

39:03.529 --> 39:06.576
then come back home,

39:06.732 --> 39:10.204
together, but not needing so much.

39:14.343 --> 39:15.973
Sure.

39:16.178 --> 39:18.043
I think you should take that trip.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.199
You should...

39:20.340 --> 39:22.716
I think you should go
wherever you want to go.

39:32.128 --> 39:35.969
We should still go somewhere
together too, though.

39:36.232 --> 39:37.798
Don't you think?

39:41.437 --> 39:42.938
Harry?

39:44.840 --> 39:47.160
Um...

39:47.510 --> 39:49.066
Harry?

39:52.415 --> 39:54.281
Just hold on a minute.

39:56.385 --> 39:58.003
Harry.

40:20.892 --> 40:22.654
<i>Harry!</i>

41:17.215 --> 41:20.031
Detective Ambrose. You should see this.
