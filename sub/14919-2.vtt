WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:05.860
I wish I could help you,
Diane, but there are none left.

00:06.070 --> 00:08.200
Mm-hmm. sorry. Okay, bye.

00:08.390 --> 00:11.510
Oh, my god. Mom, A list dish
has something about the party.

00:11.690 --> 00:13.800
It says it's gonna
be"jammed with celebrities."

00:13.940 --> 00:16.670
Why would celebrities care
about an underwear launch?

00:16.810 --> 00:18.840
- Well,it's designer underwear. 
- Oh.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.270
Yeah, our publicist invites
them. It's just business.

00:21.430 --> 00:23.280
- I can't believe I'm going. 
- What are you wearing tonight?

00:23.480 --> 00:24.640
Oh, my god.

00:24.810 --> 00:28.520
We got Paige the cutest out
fit at the mall yesterday.

00:28.690 --> 00:31.000
It was just, you know,the gal pals...

00:31.160 --> 00:33.490
With mani-pedis,lunch and shopping.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.260
We had a lot of fun.

00:35.820 --> 00:37.910
- Didn't we?
 - Mm-hmm.

00:38.220 --> 00:40.630
Well, I did anyway, chicken.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.610
Mom.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.600
I asked you to stop
calling me that, please.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.880
- I'm not a baby any more. 
- I know.

00:46.070 --> 00:48.650
Just sometimes, I need to call you that

00:48.820 --> 00:51.360
to remind myself that
you are my daughter.

00:51.540 --> 00:52.680
- Why? 
- Because...

00:52.860 --> 00:57.370
I just... I barely
recognize you sometimes.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.810
- I'll get it. 
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.560
- Hi, Kevin. 
- Hi. listen, I need a huge favor.

01:05.810 --> 01:07.510
I have to put two more names on the list

01:07.680 --> 01:10.720
- for Luc's launch party tonight. 
- no, sorry. can't do.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.470
You're the sixth person
to call this morning.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.170
Yeah, but you can pull
some strings, right?

01:14.330 --> 01:17.770
I have pulled all my strings
trying to get you and Scotty

01:17.940 --> 01:19.850
and the rest of the family
into the party already.

01:20.020 --> 01:21.090
Okay, you know what?
This is an emergency.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.810
I ran into this guy, Chazz,
from my old law firm this morning

01:23.950 --> 01:26.820
- when I was getting coffee... 
- Hey, uh, the agency sent these for tonight.

01:26.980 --> 01:29.350
- Which one do you like the most? 
- The brown one.

01:30.020 --> 01:33.360
Ew. Mom, no way. It's like
the color of baby poop.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.380
- Excuse me? 
- Sorry, but it is.

01:35.570 --> 01:36.850
What about this one?

01:37.040 --> 01:40.670
- Definitely that one. 
- You could just see the pity oozing out of him.

01:40.830 --> 01:43.390
When did you, um, become this person?

01:43.580 --> 01:46.750
I feel like your body has
been invaded by zombies

01:46.930 --> 01:49.850
- who left you all these opinions.... 
- Superior, like, you know, "I really admire you

01:50.030 --> 01:52.150
for throwing away your
career to help people."

01:52.330 --> 01:54.280
The whole time, he's
twirling his Bentley key

01:54.440 --> 01:56.540
- Hey, know what? I got another call. 
- No, wait

01:56.700 --> 01:58.480
Hey, Kitty. Listen, honey,
if you're trying to get

01:58.640 --> 02:02.460
- extra tickets for tonight,I just... I can't. I... 
- Oh, god. Is that tonight?

02:02.670 --> 02:05.720
I love you for saying
that. Thank you so much.

02:05.980 --> 02:09.560
Listen, by the way, I promised mom that
I would go house hunting with you today,

02:09.740 --> 02:10.740
- But I can't 
- Oh, whatever, whatever, whatever.

02:10.889 --> 02:12.620
I don't care about that.
That's not why I called.

02:12.810 --> 02:14.770
Here's the thing... do you
remember when I told you

02:14.910 --> 02:16.990
that mom keeps
disappearing hours at a time

02:17.170 --> 02:19.360
and then she's all cagey
about where she's been?

02:19.550 --> 02:20.960
- Mm-hmm.  -
Well, get this

02:21.150 --> 02:24.300
5:00 this morning, I walk by her room.

02:24.490 --> 02:27.200
Her bed is made, and she is gone.

02:27.690 --> 02:29.660
Where would she go so early?

02:29.890 --> 02:30.900
Well, I'm thinking

02:31.080 --> 02:34.110
that maybe her bed
wasn't... slept in at all.

02:34.330 --> 02:35.690
- Seriously? 
- well, I mean,

02:35.870 --> 02:37.390
I fell asleep at 10:00, so I can't be

02:37.550 --> 02:40.220
absolutely positive that she
didn't come home, but... but

02:40.400 --> 02:42.350
You think she's having a secret affair?

02:42.510 --> 02:43.660
Well...

02:43.840 --> 02:45.870
It crossed my mind.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.590
Wait a minute. Come... come... come on.

02:48.770 --> 02:51.180
There... there's gotta
be another explanation.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.280
- Well, I... 
- Ugh! oh, god. I forgot about Kevin.

02:53.470 --> 02:56.100
Okay, uh, sorry, Kitty.
All right. Bye, hon.

02:57.070 --> 03:00.140
- Hi, Kevin. sorry. 
- Yeah, so this twit, Chazz,

03:00.310 --> 03:01.600
he has the paper open in front of him,

03:01.770 --> 03:04.560
and guess whose full-page
ads right there. So I...

03:04.730 --> 03:08.030
- Kevin, are you still harassing me for tickets? 
- Well, yeah.

03:08.470 --> 03:10.760
It's just two. Please, please
don't make me call Chazz back

03:10.930 --> 03:12.100
and tell him couldn't get him in.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.680
- I... I mean, could you just ask Luc? 
- The answer is no.

03:15.870 --> 03:17.510
Oh, my god.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.720
- What? who is it? 
- It's Andrew Simms.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.420
I'm totally in love with him.

03:22.590 --> 03:23.680
No. Okay, uh...

03:23.870 --> 03:26.530
Hello. Hi.

03:26.690 --> 03:29.140
Yeah. uh, can you hold on a second?

03:29.350 --> 03:31.740
Luc, is there any way you could
please get me another ticket?

03:31.790 --> 03:32.740
- No! No. 
- Yeah, I could try.

03:32.890 --> 03:35.380
- No, no, no. 
- Mom, you don't understand.

03:35.580 --> 03:38.190
Listen to me. You just tell
him that you're very sorry,

03:38.340 --> 03:40.200
but that you can't, okay?

03:40.370 --> 03:42.080
Uh, Andrew, can you just hold on a second? 
- Hey, hi. How are you?

03:42.240 --> 03:44.010
I'm getting another call.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.830
Monique, Andrew Simms just asked me out,

03:46.990 --> 03:50.210
- and my mom's being totally unreasonable. 
- I'm so sorry, Scotty. You know...

03:50.350 --> 03:52.520
What? Are you kidding me?

03:52.700 --> 03:56.320
Kevin, I cannot believe
that you would stoop so low

03:56.490 --> 03:57.690
and put Scotty up to this

03:57.870 --> 04:00.510
when I clearly said "no."

04:00.680 --> 04:02.010
I don't know what you're talking about,

04:02.200 --> 04:04.880
'cause Scotty's not even here.

04:05.340 --> 04:08.880
- I think all the invitations are already gone. 
- Please, please. it's just two more people.

04:09.050 --> 04:10.570
Uh, hi, Scotty.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.770
You know I love you and everything,

04:11.950 --> 04:14.320
but could you pass on a
message to Kevin for me.

04:14.490 --> 04:17.490
That the answer is no? Thank you.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.850
She's ruining my life. Okay.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.230
Bye, Monique.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.620
Bye, Andrew.

04:24.820 --> 04:27.130
Bye, Ashley.

04:27.330 --> 04:29.580
That goes for you,
too, Kevin. Good-bye.

04:29.750 --> 04:30.950
I...

04:33.660 --> 04:35.830
Uh, Sarah, honey, you
don't have to call me back.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.260
I just wanted to let you
know, I might be late...

04:38.450 --> 04:40.620
for Luc's party tonight.

04:40.810 --> 04:42.370
Okay, bye-bye.

04:43.540 --> 04:44.520
- Hey. 
- Good morning.

04:44.740 --> 04:45.990
Good morning.

04:47.130 --> 04:48.460
Has she been down yet?

04:48.740 --> 04:50.660
Um, no, no, but I heard her
rustling around upstairs,

04:50.790 --> 04:52.800
- So I think she's up. 
- Oh.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.200
And it looks like she was
looking at real estate online,

04:56.350 --> 04:59.510
So... look at that.
That's a good sign, right?

04:59.680 --> 05:02.280
Well, maybe she'll
actually get dressed today.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.600
Or not.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.060
It's all part of the process.

05:05.380 --> 05:08.070
Ah. grieving for Robert...

05:08.240 --> 05:09.220
I completely get it.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.810
I went through the same thing
right after your father died.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.070
You just don't know how
to move on with your life.

05:14.230 --> 05:17.760
You get stuck, and oh,
my goodness, is she stuck.

05:18.020 --> 05:19.710
Hey. Maybe you should offer

05:19.910 --> 05:21.650
to go house hunting with her today.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.650
It might, you know, motivate her.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.880
- Maybe I can do it later, but I... 
- Good morning.

05:27.070 --> 05:28.820
- Hey. hey, you. 
- Good morning.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.330
So you were...

05:31.520 --> 05:33.420
up and out very early today.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.220
What was it, 5:00 a.m.?

05:36.420 --> 05:37.250
Um, yeah.

05:37.460 --> 05:40.280
I... I wanted to get in an
early-morning work out at the gym.

05:40.490 --> 05:41.880
Oh, good for you, mom.

05:42.100 --> 05:45.190
Since when are you a member at the gym?

05:45.350 --> 05:49.000
It's, you know, one of those 14-day,
free trial things. That's all.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.830
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where are you going now?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.820
Um, Saul was worried about Scotty
having the night off tonight,

05:53.990 --> 05:55.360
so I told him I'd bring over
a big pot of my crab soup.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.360
Let me get that for you.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.000
No, no, no, I'm fine. I've
got it. I'm completely good.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.180
That's heavy, mom. That's heavy.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.490
I've got it. I'll just
see you all later. Bye.

06:04.580 --> 06:05.360
That's weird.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.280
But, you know, only the
way that mom's always weird.

06:09.310 --> 06:10.770
So look, I'm doing
something this morning,

06:10.970 --> 06:13.780
but, uh, I can help you
house hunt later if you want.

06:13.970 --> 06:16.670
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

06:16.870 --> 06:18.720
Uh, oh, there you go. You like that one?

06:18.910 --> 06:21.220
- It's... it's ugly. 
- Yeah, it sucks.

06:21.450 --> 06:23.800
Okay. there you go.
House hunting complete.

06:23.970 --> 06:25.570
So do you really think that mom

06:25.750 --> 06:27.600
went to the gym at 5:00 this morning?

06:27.600 --> 06:29.000
Why are you so interested
in what mom's doing?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.690
I'm not interested in what mom's doing.

06:30.850 --> 06:32.130
Yeah, you are.

06:32.390 --> 06:34.830
I'm interested in what you're doing.

06:35.150 --> 06:37.170
What, um...

06:38.430 --> 06:39.950
I'm going to Holly's.

06:41.310 --> 06:42.980
Wow. Wow. Okay.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.670
Well, did you hear from Rebecca?

06:45.840 --> 06:49.170
No. But I'm gonna ask
David where she is.

06:49.380 --> 06:51.240
I'd ask Holly, but according to mom,

06:51.460 --> 06:53.720
you know, she barely
remembers she has a daughter.

06:53.990 --> 06:57.920
Yeah, yeah, and I guess she
hasn't shown much improvement.

06:59.450 --> 07:01.840
Well, maybe seeing you will help.

07:03.740 --> 07:04.930
Yeah.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.130
Well, you know, I'm kind a
half way hoping she forgets me.

07:08.380 --> 07:11.310
That way, one member of that
family actually won't hate me.

07:11.310 --> 07:12.830
oh, please. Good luck.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.290
- Yeah. Are you going to Luc's thing tonight? 
- I don't know.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.240
Bye. yeah.

07:17.820 --> 07:18.800
Zoe...

07:18.960 --> 07:21.290
Zoe, please, please, would you...

07:21.480 --> 07:23.470
Would you stop worrying?

07:23.650 --> 07:25.930
I went to the flower market
at 5:00 a.m. this morning.

07:26.110 --> 07:30.090
I got every single dendrobium
orchid that they had.

07:30.290 --> 07:33.530
The reception isn't
until 6:00 this evening.

07:33.810 --> 07:36.780
I know. Yes, you're my
boss, and you know best.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.130
I... I urge you, please,
to trust me on this.

07:39.340 --> 07:40.290
Just... please trust me on...

07:40.480 --> 07:41.920
and I have to go.

07:42.110 --> 07:43.310
Okay?

07:43.490 --> 07:45.790
Okay. talk... talk to you later.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.150
Saul?

07:50.450 --> 07:52.180
Scotty?

07:52.370 --> 07:54.980
I... I brought the soup.

07:55.180 --> 07:57.090
Anybody here?

08:04.910 --> 08:08.140
Hello?

08:15.000 --> 08:19.220
- Aah! Aah! 
- Aah! Ah!

08:21.000 --> 08:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:28.170 --> 08:30.000
Mateo, I don't understand
how you could do this.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.430
Kevin got you out of juvenile hall.

08:31.430 --> 08:33.799
We took you in for a night
when you needed a place to...

08:33.799 --> 08:36.200
He was clearly casing the joint so
he could come back and rip us off.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.780
Kevin, for god sakes.

08:37.940 --> 08:40.000
You sound like you're
on "Dragnet." He's a kid.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.200
Mom, he broke a window, came in here.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.230
He's about to pry
open the cash register.

08:44.410 --> 08:47.350
- That's burglary. It's a felony. 
- No, it's not.

08:47.510 --> 08:48.410
Excuse me?

08:48.590 --> 08:50.070
I didn't get any money,
and it's a business,

08:50.250 --> 08:52.200
not a residence, so it's a misdemeanor.

08:52.390 --> 08:54.000
Ha! You're wrong. We live upstairs.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.660
A good lawyer could work around that.

08:55.860 --> 08:58.320
Yeah, you had a good lawyer.
I can't be your lawyer anymore.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.460
Now I'm your victim.

08:59.660 --> 09:00.950
And you're wrong about
getting any money.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.550
Intent is intent. So don't
think you're so smart.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.940
Give me a break, man. I'm only 14.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.100
Kevin... g... get...

09:08.250 --> 09:10.440
- What? 
- I just... just...

09:13.160 --> 09:15.490
Clearly this is a very smart kid.

09:15.490 --> 09:17.500
Did you know his mother
died when he was 7?

09:17.500 --> 09:19.140
I know the whole history, okay?

09:19.140 --> 09:21.500
So you can put your violin
and your little bleeding heart

09:21.500 --> 09:22.770
back in your NPR tote bag,

09:22.990 --> 09:24.070
'cause that's not gonna help him.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.060
- Did you also know he has a grandmother? 
- Yes.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.450
And his father moved him around
so much, he lost track of her,

09:29.640 --> 09:30.980
or she of him?

09:31.160 --> 09:33.960
Do you know he's never had a
maternal figure in his life?

09:34.170 --> 09:35.720
And you wonder why he's so troubled?

09:35.930 --> 09:37.400
Okay, that's what's happening.

09:37.590 --> 09:39.960
You're clearly having some
maternal instinct eruption,

09:40.140 --> 09:41.880
so I'm gonna have to ask you
to step away from the kid,

09:42.050 --> 09:44.500
get back in your car and drive home.

09:45.400 --> 09:49.220
I found him, so I will
be responsible for him.

09:49.460 --> 09:50.630
I will talk to his father and...

09:50.820 --> 09:52.740
No, that's okay. you don't
have to go to any trouble.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.650
See, even the perp
thinks it's a bad idea.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.880
There are agencies for this
kind of stuff, mom, okay?

09:57.030 --> 09:59.600
- If not the police, then the social services. 
- No, please, please!

09:59.770 --> 10:03.150
Don't do that. I'll
do whatever she says.

10:03.420 --> 10:04.270
Well, fine.

10:04.460 --> 10:06.940
Then, Mateo, you and I are
gonna drive to your house.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.340
I'm gonna tell your
father about your behavior,

10:09.520 --> 10:11.470
and then we'll decide what to do.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.680
- N... 
- End of discuion.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.070
Okay, Nora, I can't let
you do that by yourself,

10:16.270 --> 10:17.870
- so I'll go with you. 
- Scotty!

10:18.040 --> 10:19.650
I know your mom well enough,
and we're not gonna get her

10:19.810 --> 10:24.460
- to change her mind, so... 
- Mateo, up, walk.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.990
Okay, everyone, wait.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.450
Give me the car keys. I'll drive.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.830
C... could you keep it
down? It's very distracting.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.550
I'm trying to work here.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.040
Oh, very funny. This
is work, too, you know?

10:47.230 --> 10:48.920
I know those abs are paying
the bills around here,

10:49.150 --> 10:50.750
and don't think I'm not grateful.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.230
Besides, I kind of like this
"living off a man" thing.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.760
It's a whole new experience for me.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.920
Ugh. Agatha. Paige's friend.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.240
She probably wants into the party.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.240
Well, don't pick it up if
you're going to yell at her.

11:03.470 --> 11:05.630
No, I like Agatha. She's
one of the sweet ones.

11:06.780 --> 11:10.360
Hey, Agatha. Listen, uh,
Paige isn't here right now.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.530
Oh, hey, Nell. It's her mom.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.140
Is everything okay with Aggie?

11:15.910 --> 11:17.200
Oh, god. Really?

11:17.380 --> 11:19.010
No, I had no idea.

11:19.230 --> 11:21.310
I don't know why Paige would do that.

11:21.490 --> 11:24.530
I'll... I'll... I'll talk to
her as soon as she gets home.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.500
She said what?

11:30.670 --> 11:33.670
I might not remember what you say.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.670
I'm still learning to process.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.150
Oh, no, I... I totally understand.

11:37.310 --> 11:41.030
And sometimes, I get confused.

11:41.340 --> 11:43.970
I'm here to talk to you
and David about Rebecca.

11:44.710 --> 11:46.130
Oh.

11:47.270 --> 11:50.030
I'm still working on that.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.030
Oh, I have these pictures...

11:54.240 --> 11:55.490
of her on the counter

11:55.700 --> 11:56.840
that you might like to see.

11:57.310 --> 11:59.090
Yeah, sure. I'd... I'd love to.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.550
They're part of my therapy,
to... to look at them.

12:02.670 --> 12:05.190
They're kinda like flash cards.

12:05.390 --> 12:08.100
I mean, it's funny. I... I still
remember what flash cards are,

12:08.260 --> 12:11.980
but I don't remember my own daughter.

12:12.180 --> 12:14.080
Are... are you in any of these pictures?

12:14.240 --> 12:16.330
Uh, yeah, yeah. Well, I... I should be.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.110
Yeah. Uh...

12:25.060 --> 12:27.210
Maybe not.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.600
Hi.

12:32.370 --> 12:34.270
What are you doing here?

12:34.960 --> 12:38.510
I'm here to talk to you
and Holly about Rebecca.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.660
Hmm. Why don't we go talk outside?

12:40.860 --> 12:42.130
What's the matter?

12:42.370 --> 12:45.190
Nothing, I just want
to talk to Justin alone.

12:45.470 --> 12:47.100
Well, I... I can see something is wrong,

12:47.360 --> 12:48.740
So why don't you just tell me?

12:48.930 --> 12:51.970
- Holly, let me just deal with this. 
- No, no, don't do that.

12:52.140 --> 12:56.170
I mean, if something is wrong,
then just... just tell me.

13:01.290 --> 13:02.650
I let Rebecca down.

13:02.870 --> 13:04.120
Let her down?

13:04.320 --> 13:05.850
You ran out on her when she needed you.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.640
I did not run out on her.

13:07.850 --> 13:10.170
I left because I couldn't
help her or myself

13:10.360 --> 13:11.800
or anybody else after the accident.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.000
You broke my daughter's heart

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
because you had to go off
and play soldier for a year.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.290
I told my wife that I loved her,
and I asked her to wait for me.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.660
David, I'm trying to save my marriage,

13:19.850 --> 13:21.950
and the only way I can do that
is if you tell me where she is.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.220
- Oh, my god. 
- Holly...

13:24.430 --> 13:28.330
- She's your wife? 
- Yeah.

13:28.510 --> 13:29.610
Holly, we'll go over this again.

13:29.780 --> 13:32.130
- We'll talk about this later. 
- You... oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

13:32.310 --> 13:33.830
I'm sorry.

13:34.020 --> 13:37.480
He loves her.

13:39.970 --> 13:43.370
I... is this my fault?

13:43.570 --> 13:45.650
- Holly...
- No, no.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.710
I mean, is that why
you're not telling me?

13:48.710 --> 13:50.000
Listen, Holly, this is my fault.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.530
I mean, is that why you
don't want to talk about it?

13:51.710 --> 13:53.220
- No, Holly, this is my fault. 
- Is that what it is?

13:53.460 --> 13:53.990
- No, no, no, no. 
- You know, you really...

13:54.170 --> 13:57.640
You can't stop hurting this
family, can you? Get out.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.560
I'm sorry, Holly.

14:06.710 --> 14:08.410
Oh, it's okay.

14:08.990 --> 14:11.480
It's okay.

14:24.410 --> 14:25.910
He's not here. See?

14:27.490 --> 14:29.280
Ah.

14:29.460 --> 14:33.040
Well, then I would like to
leave a note for your father.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.390
- A note? 
- Yes, with my contact information,

14:36.560 --> 14:38.150
and that we're concerned
about your behavior,

14:38.320 --> 14:41.140
- and that we'd like to help. 
- Who's gonna deliver the note, him?

14:41.650 --> 14:43.730
Then I'll follow up with a phone call.

14:43.910 --> 14:45.000
We don't have a phone.

14:45.190 --> 14:48.400
Well, I guess I'll have
to come back then, won't I?

14:48.750 --> 14:50.460
Oh, darn it. I didn't bring my note p...

14:50.670 --> 14:53.880
- Could I borrow a piece of paper? 
- We don't have any.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.940
Oh, come on. You're not
gonna get out of this.

14:57.340 --> 14:58.930
Uh, maybe my dad might
have some in his room.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.520
I'll go check.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.400
Oh, god.

15:05.590 --> 15:08.040
Kevin, we can't leave him here.

15:08.260 --> 15:10.360
Wh... don't be so judgmental.

15:10.550 --> 15:13.110
I mean, it's messy, but
it's perfectly adequate.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.400
Not everyone has to live
in a mansion in Pasadena.

15:15.570 --> 15:18.980
Maybe if you had not grown up
in that mansion in Pasadena,

15:19.170 --> 15:21.780
- with all of its advantages and opportun... 
- He's gone.

15:21.970 --> 15:23.840
- What? 
- He went out the window.

15:24.070 --> 15:26.880
Oh, my god. Kevin, what are we gonna do?

15:30.750 --> 15:33.230
Oh. I don't know.

15:33.310 --> 15:35.880
Maybe mama should
write children's books.

15:36.050 --> 15:37.020
What do you think of that?

15:37.180 --> 15:38.540
I could work out of the house,

15:38.740 --> 15:41.600
and I could write books about dinosaurs.

15:42.010 --> 15:45.500
Would you call me if you
have any word what so ever?

15:45.680 --> 15:46.620
Okay.

15:46.850 --> 15:49.370
Oh! There is my big boy.

15:49.580 --> 15:53.710
Oh, you are a sight for
sore eyes, my friend.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.840
The tickle bug is gonna get you.

15:56.350 --> 15:57.360
Grandma.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.910
- Hi. 
- Wow. This is perfect timing,

16:00.100 --> 16:02.790
because, um, Evan and I
were just about to go out

16:02.940 --> 16:04.890
and do some... some house hunting.

16:05.070 --> 16:06.060
Right? Right?

16:06.310 --> 16:09.250
And, um, you can be my copilot.

16:09.480 --> 16:13.140
Oh, Kitty. I would love to
go house hunting with you.

16:13.310 --> 16:15.820
I'm... I'm pooped out.

16:16.020 --> 16:19.390
Well... what happened?

16:19.580 --> 16:21.710
I can't tell you about it right now.

16:21.890 --> 16:22.700
I just... I just can't.

16:22.880 --> 16:26.400
I'm gonna sit here
and... and gather my wits.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.020
Ugh.

16:34.810 --> 16:35.920
Well, who was it?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.630
Oh. A friend.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.750
I'll call back.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.360
House hunting, Kitty.

16:42.550 --> 16:44.360
I... I'd... I'd love to go with you.

16:44.530 --> 16:46.610
- Anytime. You name it. 
- Tomorrow.

16:46.790 --> 16:47.840
Tomorrow's not good.

16:48.020 --> 16:50.470
You're busy, busy by all day?

16:50.660 --> 16:52.370
I can go with you after 4:00.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.950
Well, the houses aren't open after...

16:59.150 --> 17:00.850
Hello.

17:01.810 --> 17:03.680
Hi.

17:03.980 --> 17:05.900
I specifically asked you

17:06.079 --> 17:09.140
never to call me on this home number.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.280
Well, why is Mrs. Powell crying?

17:11.450 --> 17:13.089
I've got plenty of
time to get to her house

17:13.250 --> 17:15.390
and arrange all of the bouquets.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.770
- 3:00?! You told me 6:00. 
- shh.

17:17.930 --> 17:21.490
No wonder she's crying. tell
her I'll be there in 15 minutes.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.130
I thought you understood

17:24.319 --> 17:27.270
my wanting to keep this private.

17:27.450 --> 17:28.200
I'm s... I'm sorry.

17:28.380 --> 17:32.260
I'm sorry I snapped at
you. it's just...wkward.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.800
I haven't told my family yet.

17:36.520 --> 17:40.490
Yes, of course.you have needs.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.060
Quite obviously,so do I.

17:43.290 --> 17:47.640
it's just sometimes
you push me too hard.

17:47.820 --> 17:49.210
oh, don't hang up. Don't hang up.

17:49.410 --> 17:52.640
Don't... please. I'm sorry. Aw, jeez.

17:54.690 --> 17:57.320
shh. shh. shh. shh. shh.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.030
Hmm. Everything okay?

18:02.170 --> 18:03.180
Fine.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.990
Oh, I just remembered.

18:05.170 --> 18:08.110
I have to pick up my dress
for the party tonight.

18:08.290 --> 18:09.720
- It's at the dry cleaners. 
- Oh, you know mom,

18:09.890 --> 18:12.390
you've had a very emotional morning.

18:12.580 --> 18:13.520
why don't you just let me
go? Why don't you sit down

18:13.670 --> 18:18.520
- and put your feet up, and I'll... I'll go to the cleaners? 
- No. They know me.

18:18.690 --> 18:19.890
No, I... it's fine.
It's fine. They know me.

18:20.070 --> 18:22.450
It'll be just fine. mwah.
mwah. mwah. mwah. mwah.

18:29.380 --> 18:31.450
All right, Evan. Come on.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.160
We're gonna go find out
what grandma is doing

18:33.340 --> 18:36.520
that she doesn't want us
to know that she's doing.

18:36.910 --> 18:39.810
You and Agatha used to
be such close friends.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.560
That was in seventh grade.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.350
Her mom said that you
won't talk to her anymore.

18:46.480 --> 18:49.040
It's not that I won't.
I just don't that much.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.450
Well, why don't you?

18:50.680 --> 18:52.370
She's just really immature.

18:52.580 --> 18:54.320
Is that why you said she was stupid?

18:54.540 --> 18:56.600
- I didn't say it to her face. 
- no, I know.

18:56.790 --> 19:00.150
- But it got back to her, didn't it? 
- She's such a baby.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.160
She's still wears a
Hello Kitty backpack,

19:02.360 --> 19:05.480
and all she ever wants to do
is make friendship bracelets.

19:05.670 --> 19:09.360
- Since when did you care so much about what people wear? 
- Excuse me?

19:09.560 --> 19:11.910
Who wouldn't let me buy the
dress I wanted yesterday?

19:12.110 --> 19:13.480
Uh, the one with the
checkbook, that's who.

19:13.670 --> 19:16.080
look, Paige, I'm not
gonna fight about that.

19:16.260 --> 19:19.720
I am not happy about
this Agatha situation.

19:19.920 --> 19:23.350
So you get to pick out
my clothes and my friends?

19:25.370 --> 19:26.920
I'm starting to think you shouldn't go

19:27.110 --> 19:28.500
- to this party tonight.
- No!

19:28.870 --> 19:31.810
Mm-hmm. Mom, stop. That's
not fair. You promised.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.450
- I never promised. you're not entitled, Paige. 
- You promised, mom.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.640
Hey...  Wait. Wait, wait, both of you.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.610
- Please, let's try to find a compromise. 
- Um...

19:38.770 --> 19:40.660
wWhat if Paige apologizedto Agatha?

19:40.780 --> 19:43.580
Then can she go to the party?

19:44.350 --> 19:46.750
That is an excellent idea.

19:46.940 --> 19:49.890
- And there's no time like the present. 
- Now?

19:51.470 --> 19:53.650
- Come on. I will drive you up there. 
- Thanks, babe.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.600
Oh, my god. That'd be so awesome.

19:55.810 --> 19:58.080
Agatha and her Mom are gonna
faint when they see you.

19:59.570 --> 20:01.200
Can we goto all my friends' houses?

20:01.370 --> 20:03.500
Uh, come on. Just... Let's go.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.370
Oh, my god.

20:34.030 --> 20:35.740
Oh, my god.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.080
Oh, my god.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.800
Oh, my god.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.690
Kevin. Kevin, you're... you're...

20:43.850 --> 20:46.280
You're never gonna believe this.
you have to call me right back.

20:46.490 --> 20:48.590
I think mom's a lesbian.

20:55.470 --> 20:57.100
# Saw youfrom across the room #

20:57.450 --> 20:59.320
# But I checked into the groove #

20:59.510 --> 21:02.980
# Did you spin that record so
iwould show you what I can do? #

21:03.250 --> 21:04.920
# I came here for you #

21:05.110 --> 21:06.790
# Heard about what you can do #

21:06.990 --> 21:11.200
# I waited all day toeel this good #

21:11.470 --> 21:14.240
# I ain't looking for
notrouble when I move this way #

21:14.410 --> 21:15.860
- Hey, baby. Mm. 
- Hello.

21:16.380 --> 21:18.270
Gosh, you look so beautiful.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.560
I want to show you off to everyone.

21:21.450 --> 21:22.680
Oh, my god.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.260
- What? 
- Is that Paris Hilton?

21:25.480 --> 21:27.020
Paris Hilton?

21:27.210 --> 21:28.890
I thought she didn't
believe in underwear.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.920
Should we check it out
and see if it's her?

21:31.080 --> 21:32.920
- Can I, mom? 
- Sure.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.380
Thank you, Luc.

21:37.020 --> 21:38.350
Do you want to come?

21:38.540 --> 21:41.440
You know, I'm gonna wait here
for the rest of the family.

21:42.030 --> 21:42.640
- Okay. 
- All right. come on, Luc. Let's go.

21:42.850 --> 21:44.960
Get back to me.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.220
# I feel hypnotized, I'm too... #

21:47.310 --> 21:48.750
Not mom. It is not possible.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.960
Trust me, Kevin, if
you had seen what I saw,

21:51.120 --> 21:52.220
there is no question.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.600
Anybody else... Sarah,
even you... not mom.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.760
- What do you mean, even me? 
- Can we talk about something else?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.620
I would really like
to enjoy this evening.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.570
Well, Kevin, you know,
it's not unusual for women

22:01.570 --> 22:04.370
- to have lesbian conversions late in life. 
- Says who?

22:04.500 --> 22:05.740
It's true, Kevin.

22:05.980 --> 22:07.970
No, it's not, Kitty.
63-year-old widows

22:08.160 --> 22:10.180
don't suddenly try
out for the other team.

22:10.370 --> 22:13.220
- Okay, give me your smart
phone, Mr. Smarty-pants.  - Fine.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.590
I can't believe you of all
people would be so closed-minded.

22:16.780 --> 22:18.000
What are you gonna do?

22:18.190 --> 22:20.590
I am googling "senior citizen lesbians"

22:20.820 --> 22:22.860
- to show you all the psychological evidence. 
- Ugh.

22:23.070 --> 22:24.660
Ah. millions of references.

22:24.850 --> 22:28.130
- Doesn't mean anything. 
- Oh, no.

22:28.290 --> 22:30.000
No, I don't want that.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.950
- What's wrong? 
- I accidentally opened a photo.

22:32.130 --> 22:33.930
- How do you close this window? 
- Wait, wait, wait, w... oh!

22:34.070 --> 22:36.230
- Yeah, they're... 
- oh, my God. Oh, my God. What did you do?

22:36.450 --> 22:40.140
- They're all porn sites. 
- Ugh! You downloaded senior citizen lesbian porn

22:40.280 --> 22:41.960
- on to my phone? 
- I didn't mean to.

22:42.170 --> 22:43.250
- Great. 
- You hit "slideshow."

22:43.450 --> 22:45.780
- Well, make it stop. 
- Hey, guys. This is a fun party, huh?

22:46.610 --> 22:47.410
Uh... oh.

22:47.570 --> 22:48.760
What the hell is that?!

22:48.760 --> 22:50.760
Scotty trying to convince
me that mom is a lesbian.

22:50.930 --> 22:52.800
- What? Uncle Saul's
not enough for you?

22:52.950 --> 22:55.750
- Now you want mom? 
- Okay, there. I stopped it.

22:55.980 --> 22:58.630
Thank god. Justin, I'm sorry.
That was a horrible accident.

22:59.730 --> 23:01.380
- Oh, my god. 
- What?

23:01.570 --> 23:03.060
Why are the police calling you?

23:03.260 --> 23:04.410
Oh, maybe your phone is tapped.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.530
Scotty, it's not illegal to
look at grandmas doing it.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.400
- Are you sure? 
- Positive.

23:09.570 --> 23:11.610
Well, then why aren't you answering it?

23:12.680 --> 23:14.160
Kevin Walker.

23:15.370 --> 23:16.680
Yeah.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.390
Oh, that's just perfect.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.970
- Oh, mom. 
- Hi.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.680
Hi. Welcome to the house of fun.

23:27.870 --> 23:30.590
Yeah. All of this for $50 underpants?

23:31.240 --> 23:32.140
I know.

23:32.380 --> 23:35.710
It just is amazing where
your life can take you.

23:36.870 --> 23:38.250
Is that Paige?

23:38.440 --> 23:39.720
Hmm? Yes, but don't be surprised

23:39.900 --> 23:41.440
if she pretends not to recognize us.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.370
We're not very cool in her estimation.

23:43.580 --> 23:45.150
Isn't she a little young
for this crowd, Sarah?

23:45.320 --> 23:46.630
I don't think so, mom. Look.

23:46.790 --> 23:50.970
She's found a nice, young girl
her own age to hang out with.

23:51.150 --> 23:52.250
Hi, grandma.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.740
Hi. Oh, my goodness. Look at you.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.350
- You look so grown-up.
 - Doesn't she?

23:56.630 --> 24:00.260
I know. Um, mom, grandma, this is Layla.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.270
- I just met her. 
- Nice to meet you.

24:01.450 --> 24:04.570
- Nice to meet you. 
- Hey, Layla. What brings you here tonight?

24:04.770 --> 24:06.200
Who brings you here tonight?

24:06.410 --> 24:08.170
- I came with my parents. 
- Oh.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.440
One of my dad's patients invited us.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.390
- Ah. 
- Your dad's a doctor?

24:12.620 --> 24:15.800
- Yes. 
- Well, um, your uncles and aunt are in the next room.

24:15.980 --> 24:18.090
Should we go show them
your beautiful dress?

24:18.290 --> 24:21.080
Uh, no, I want to
introduce Layla to Luc.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.530
Oh. Okay.

24:23.710 --> 24:25.770
- Well, have fun. 
- Okay.

24:25.960 --> 24:26.460
- Nice meeting you. 
- Bye.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.280
- Nice meeting you. 
- What a sweet girl.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.010
20 bucks says her
father's a plastic surgeon.

24:33.220 --> 24:36.700
# Oh, make me, baby, I
wanna feel beautiful #

24:36.880 --> 24:38.320
# I wanna feel #

24:38.540 --> 24:40.670
# Beautiful #

24:40.780 --> 24:42.140
# Oh, make me feel #

24:42.330 --> 24:44.330
# Beautiful #

24:44.510 --> 24:45.900
# Yeah #

24:46.140 --> 24:49.680
So the wedding was at the beach.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.870
There you are.

24:52.060 --> 24:55.110
You look so beautiful.

24:57.230 --> 24:58.630
Oh.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.610
Justin looks so handsome.

25:00.780 --> 25:02.830
Right. You recognize him?

25:03.330 --> 25:04.650
He was here today.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.540
Right.

25:06.740 --> 25:08.780
He reminds me of William.

25:08.990 --> 25:12.050
And he doesn't talk
to me like I'm a child.

25:13.550 --> 25:15.770
What about her?

25:15.980 --> 25:17.950
- That's Rebecca. 
- Yeah.

25:18.140 --> 25:21.630
You've shown me her
photograph a hundred times.

25:21.870 --> 25:23.410
Well, yeah, I... I was hoping

25:23.600 --> 25:25.590
maybe we could talk
about her a little bit.

25:25.820 --> 25:27.290
David, I'm tired.

25:27.480 --> 25:30.210
I mean, you can show me these pictures,

25:30.400 --> 25:32.050
uh, uh, forever,

25:32.260 --> 25:34.180
and I'm still not gonna feel anything

25:34.370 --> 25:36.450
other than more lonely.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.740
They're gone.

25:38.950 --> 25:42.120
and you are my only family now.

25:43.720 --> 25:47.390
And every day, I see that
disappointment in your face.

25:47.590 --> 25:48.640
No, it's not disappointment.

25:48.870 --> 25:52.200
I just thought that maybe...
I... I could show you these

25:52.420 --> 25:57.780
and give you a... a sense of the
kind of person that our daughter is.

25:59.660 --> 26:04.380
I can't feel something
that I don't feel.

26:07.070 --> 26:09.500
I'm sorry.

26:22.660 --> 26:24.240
You see her?

26:24.420 --> 26:25.890
Yeah.

26:26.130 --> 26:28.190
My father did her boobs.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.290
I don't think I should have anymore.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.770
I feel really dizzy.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.380
You're supposed to feel dizzy.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.980
That's the whole point.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.960
Mateo told the police I was his lawyer.

26:39.170 --> 26:41.120
- Well, are you gonna bail him out of jail? 
- No, I'm gonna let him

26:41.300 --> 26:42.880
cool his heels for a couple of hours,

26:43.070 --> 26:44.630
- 'cause he might learn a lesson. 
- Kevin, you can't...

26:44.820 --> 26:46.160
Mom, I don't want to talk about him.

26:46.350 --> 26:48.230
If it wasn't for you, he might
not have jumped out of a window

26:48.400 --> 26:49.760
and been picked up for
vagrancy in the first place,

26:49.930 --> 26:53.080
- so let's drop it and enjoy what's left of this party. 
- Kevin...

26:55.930 --> 26:57.590
Don't start.

26:57.810 --> 26:59.280
- What? Kitty, don't. 
- She's got to.

27:00.650 --> 27:02.000
- So hi. 
- Hi, mom.

27:02.190 --> 27:04.640
I, uh, I thought maybe, uh...

27:04.830 --> 27:07.330
you would bring a date tonight.

27:07.530 --> 27:09.160
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

27:09.360 --> 27:12.830
I'm not interested in
men whatsoever right now.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.310
Yeah.

27:14.510 --> 27:16.290
Mom, listen, um...

27:16.480 --> 27:19.250
we all know your secret.

27:19.490 --> 27:21.580
- Yeah. 
- Kitty told us.

27:22.740 --> 27:23.770
How did you find out?

27:24.080 --> 27:26.500
I... I followed you.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.360
- You followed me? 
- Well, you know, that doesn't matter.

27:28.580 --> 27:29.940
That is not the point. The point is,

27:30.150 --> 27:32.780
- is that you didn't feel comfortable enough to tell us. 
- Yeah.

27:32.980 --> 27:37.230
- I can't believe you followed me. 
- Mom, what's important is...

27:38.160 --> 27:40.230
we are all okay with it.

27:40.430 --> 27:41.550
- Yeah, yeah. 
- I am not okay with it. I'm just sayin'...

27:41.720 --> 27:42.350
- Me either. 
- I'm not okay with it.

27:42.520 --> 27:48.140
Now that... that... that is
exactly why I didn't tell you.

27:48.350 --> 27:49.550
- I knew you would be critical and... 
- No.

27:49.740 --> 27:51.770
try to talk me out of
it, but it's too bad.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.620
- You know what? I happen to be really enjoying myself.
- Great.

27:54.810 --> 27:56.340
Ugh. I didn't need to hear that. Ugh.

27:56.540 --> 27:59.320
There's nothing unusual
about a woman my age

27:59.530 --> 28:01.630
- who wants to try something new. 
- Right.

28:01.830 --> 28:04.540
- Told you. 
- All right, the truth is,

28:04.840 --> 28:07.350
things have been a little tight lately.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.130
- I needed the money. 
- What?

28:10.690 --> 28:11.620
w... w... wait a minute.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.460
You're going out with
this woman for her money?

28:14.660 --> 28:16.170
What woman?

28:16.440 --> 28:17.530
Your girlfriend.

28:17.750 --> 28:20.880
Yeah. I saw you together.
I... I saw you... hugging her

28:21.060 --> 28:22.700
and... and giving her flowers and...

28:22.900 --> 28:24.470
Oh, my god. You think I'm gay?

28:24.660 --> 28:26.740
- Yeah. 
- Well, aren't you?

28:26.930 --> 28:30.390
No! I'm not a lesbian. I'm a florist.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.140
What?

28:32.340 --> 28:33.910
- Oh, thank god. 
- I... I got a job.

28:34.140 --> 28:36.650
I'm... I work at Zoe's
Flowers in old town.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.150
- I told you. 
- Oh.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.440
Mom.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.860
Paige, are you okay, honey?

28:43.140 --> 28:45.620
Can we go home now?

28:46.720 --> 28:48.910
Oh, my g... Paige,
have you been drinking?

28:49.720 --> 28:52.600
I don't feel so good.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.620
Come on, Paige.

29:07.810 --> 29:09.220
You don't want to let me in?

29:09.390 --> 29:10.700
No.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.990
Well, I guess she'll stop
throwing up eventually.

29:13.170 --> 29:16.070
Look, Mom, I... am really sorry

29:16.220 --> 29:18.750
that I told everybody you're a lesbian.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.310
But I don't understand why
you had to be so secretive

29:21.490 --> 29:23.070
about needing a job.

29:23.250 --> 29:24.140
If... if I had known that,

29:24.340 --> 29:27.890
- I would've been happy to give you a check.
- And that's exactly why I didn't tell you.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.690
It's not just about the money, Kitty.

29:32.430 --> 29:33.990
Oh, god, that sounded
really bad, didn't it?

29:34.170 --> 29:36.650
- Should I be worried? 
- No, no, no, no. I've had some experience with this.

29:36.820 --> 29:39.220
Puking in a public bathroom
always amplifies the sound.

29:39.420 --> 29:41.090
- That's... that's true. 
- Yes.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.210
Okay. Thanks. I'm glad you're here.

29:44.570 --> 29:47.570
I feel bad. you should be
out there enjoying yourself.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.930
- I'm fine. 
- Come on, Justin. You're a young man.

29:50.130 --> 29:53.010
- There's a lot of really nice-looking
girls...  - Sarah, I'm married.

29:53.260 --> 29:55.550
- Okay. sorry. 
- I'm not interested in meeting ladies.

29:55.730 --> 29:58.030
And I don't know why all of you
think Rebecca's not coming back,

29:58.190 --> 29:58.790
- because she certainly is. 
- No, I didn't...

29:59.020 --> 30:01.670
- That's exactly what you're saying. 
- That is not what I'm saying.

30:01.770 --> 30:04.570
- Uh, we, uh, called the jail. Mateo's gonna be fine. 
- Yeah, in your opinion.

30:04.750 --> 30:05.740
Look, he's perfectly safe.

30:05.950 --> 30:07.530
- I will pick him up in the morning, okay? 
- In the morning? Kevin, come on.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.920
Can we just leave it...
yeah, you know what?

30:09.140 --> 30:10.360
- There are consequences for his actions. 
- Oh, he's 14. "consequences"

30:10.540 --> 30:15.420
- I hope he learns something. Jumping out a window... 
- Stop! stop! stop!

30:15.600 --> 30:19.500
I have had it with each
and every one of you.

30:20.030 --> 30:22.490
Kevin, who are you?

30:22.670 --> 30:25.240
When did you become so
cynical and hard-hearted

30:25.420 --> 30:27.930
that you would leave that boy in jail

30:28.140 --> 30:29.320
when any fool would know

30:29.520 --> 30:32.120
that he didn't break into
the restaurant for the money?

30:32.330 --> 30:33.500
He's all alone in the world.

30:33.690 --> 30:35.600
He doesn't have anyone
to take care of him.

30:35.790 --> 30:38.970
He broke into the restaurant
hoping that you would find him

30:39.150 --> 30:40.430
and help him.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.480
And, Justin...

30:42.670 --> 30:44.160
Justin, if you want
to save your marriage,

30:44.330 --> 30:46.220
you have to start acting like a husband.

30:46.430 --> 30:49.390
A good husband takes
care of his wife's family

30:49.580 --> 30:51.390
even when she can't.

30:51.780 --> 30:53.120
Mom.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.870
Y... you might want to
just take it down a notch.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.060
No.

30:57.410 --> 30:58.800
Kitty, no.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.060
Living in limbo and
trying to avoid the future

31:01.250 --> 31:03.130
is not gonna help you one little bit.

31:03.340 --> 31:05.040
And neither is inventing

31:05.210 --> 31:07.280
a fictional life for your mother.

31:07.820 --> 31:12.240
You need to take the first
painful steps of your new life.

31:12.450 --> 31:14.000
They don't need to be big or profound.

31:14.210 --> 31:17.530
it just needs to be something, honey.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.920
That was really beautiful
mom. she's right, Kitty.

31:20.060 --> 31:22.860
She... 'cause she kinda nailed you.

31:23.820 --> 31:26.830
What? you're not gonna skip over me?

31:27.020 --> 31:29.500
No, Sarah. I'm not gonna skip you.

31:29.730 --> 31:33.600
What on earth were you thinking,
bringing Paige to this party?

31:33.820 --> 31:36.130
She doesn't need you to be her friend.

31:36.290 --> 31:37.620
She needs you to be her mother.

31:37.810 --> 31:39.390
Tell her to unlock the damn door,

31:39.580 --> 31:42.980
go in there, clean her
up, and take her home.

31:43.180 --> 31:45.460
Why are you all standing
around? You've got things to do.

31:45.650 --> 31:47.720
- Go! 
-  Go. Go, go, go.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.140
Paige, you open this door,
or you're grounded for a year.

31:49.330 --> 31:51.470
Hello. Hello.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.950
Excuse me.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.030
That was really impressive.

31:55.240 --> 31:58.020
My name is Zeke Maris. I
produce talk radio shows.

31:58.230 --> 32:00.120
I'm putting together
a call-in advice show,

32:00.330 --> 32:02.760
and I think that you would be perfect.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.320
If you're interested,

32:04.610 --> 32:06.630
I hope that you will give me a call.

32:09.250 --> 32:10.370
Really?

32:10.590 --> 32:11.760
Yes, really.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.840
Well, I...

32:14.370 --> 32:16.210
I... I'm speechless,

32:16.390 --> 32:17.450
which hardly ever happens.

32:17.610 --> 32:19.190
It would certainly never
happen on the radio.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.960
- That would be bad. 
- So I hope that you give me a call, miss...

32:23.160 --> 32:25.020
Walker. N... Nora Walker.

32:25.230 --> 32:26.080
Good night, Nora Walker.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.590
Good night.

32:35.270 --> 32:36.490
I'm so sorry.

32:37.840 --> 32:38.510
Is she okay?

32:38.720 --> 32:40.950
She's upstairs working
on her first hangover.

32:41.110 --> 32:43.900
Thank god she had the
sense to take her insulin.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.950
I'm blown away. I... I never expected

32:46.150 --> 32:48.100
- anything like that from Paige. 
- Yeah.

32:48.340 --> 32:51.430
- She must have fell in with the wrong crowd. 
- I don't know.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.400
I'm starting to think
maybe I'm the wrong crowd.

32:54.580 --> 32:55.810
Why are you saying that?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.560
Well, it was bad judgment
to let her go to that party.

32:58.750 --> 33:02.740
And I think I did it
because I'm jealous of you.

33:02.930 --> 33:06.010
Are you crazy? I... I don't
care about any other woman.

33:06.190 --> 33:09.220
No, I'm not talking
about "other woman", Luc.

33:09.410 --> 33:11.840
I'm talking about Paige.

33:13.780 --> 33:16.830
I think I'm jealous because
she likes you more than me.

33:17.030 --> 33:18.630
There. I said it.

33:18.820 --> 33:19.860
That's even crazier.

33:20.050 --> 33:21.710
No, it's not. It's true right now.

33:21.910 --> 33:25.130
I see how she admires you,
and... and she looks up to you,

33:25.310 --> 33:29.090
and she thinks you're
so cool, which you are.

33:29.310 --> 33:32.630
And I knew that if I didn't let her
go to the party, she would hate me.

33:32.780 --> 33:35.920
And I wanted her to think
that I was a cool mom, so...

33:36.570 --> 33:38.290
I let her get carried away

33:38.450 --> 33:41.650
by things that you and
I just don't believe in.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.030
Look, all stuff she
likes is not even real.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.840
I'm not that guy up on the billboard.

33:46.050 --> 33:47.890
I'm just a painter
trying to make a living.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.320
No, well, I know that.

33:51.440 --> 33:55.140
Look, I... if anybody's
to blame here... it's me.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.670
No.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.840
No, Luc, I'm her mother.

34:00.010 --> 34:02.380
I should set the values around here.

34:07.390 --> 34:09.300
Why did you call me?

34:09.570 --> 34:11.460
You're my lawyer.

34:11.650 --> 34:12.909
Okay, the police picked you up

34:13.150 --> 34:14.810
because you were asleep in an alleyway.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.920
There was no charge.
You don't need a lawyer.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.870
I figured maybe you
could use the extra money.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.949
Yeah, I'm getting rich
doing pro bono work

34:23.139 --> 34:25.460
for the likes of you.

34:27.540 --> 34:28.810
Why didn't you call your father?

34:28.960 --> 34:31.699
I know he has a cell phone.

34:32.630 --> 34:34.739
Are you scared of your dad?

34:35.810 --> 34:37.610
Only when he's around.

34:39.070 --> 34:41.360
Mateo, if you want me to help you,

34:41.590 --> 34:44.630
all you have to do is ask.

34:44.900 --> 34:47.070
- Mateo. 
- Give me a minute, okay?

34:47.300 --> 34:49.830
You're not exactly the
easiest person to ask.

34:49.989 --> 34:52.850
- Really? 
- You're kind of cranky.

34:54.449 --> 34:58.000
Yeah, I've heard that before. Sorry.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.940
I don't have a place to go,

35:01.140 --> 35:03.590
and I'm scared of my dad.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.600
I need your help.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.500
Okay.

35:10.770 --> 35:12.020
I'll do everything I can.

35:12.210 --> 35:13.660
I promise.

35:13.870 --> 35:15.000
but you have to trust me.

35:15.430 --> 35:18.920
and I have to be able to trust you.

35:20.060 --> 35:22.540
So no more jumping out of windows.

35:23.530 --> 35:25.010
Okay.

35:25.190 --> 35:26.660
Okay.

35:28.590 --> 35:30.390
Can we go now?

35:31.080 --> 35:33.160
Yeah.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.300
Just... one more thing. Um...

35:38.600 --> 35:41.540
I'm sorry I was late
getting here tonight.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.100
I got a little lost on the way.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.150
Oh, come on in.

35:58.340 --> 35:59.590
Hey.

36:00.790 --> 36:03.250
- Hey, listen, I know I said a few things... 
- I want to apolo...

36:03.730 --> 36:04.750
Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. go ahead.

36:05.020 --> 36:08.770
- No, you go. 
- All right. Listen, I... I really appreciate your calling

36:08.970 --> 36:11.070
and asking if you could help.

36:11.230 --> 36:13.810
and I also appreciate you not
asking me where Rebecca is.

36:13.980 --> 36:17.260
Oh, no. I'm... I'm here
to help Holly... and you.

36:17.440 --> 36:20.200
Look, your family's already helped
a lot by handling the land sale.

36:20.460 --> 36:23.900
Great. What... what can I do?

36:23.990 --> 36:27.090
I just talked to her. When I
told her you are coming over

36:27.560 --> 36:31.320
she was really happy.
That doesn't happen a lot.

36:31.520 --> 36:35.460
She doesn't remember who Rebecca was. I
think she feels like you are the way back.

36:36.140 --> 36:37.640
Hey, Justin.

36:38.540 --> 36:41.280
Hey. Uh, you remember my name.

36:41.470 --> 36:44.360
I know, it's great, right?

36:44.590 --> 36:46.620
Yeah.

36:46.940 --> 36:48.700
Good. Kitty, I'm glad you're up.

36:48.860 --> 36:50.250
- Oh, hey. 
- I wanted to show you this...

36:50.420 --> 36:52.260
before I go to work.

36:52.470 --> 36:56.850
- Okay, well I.... 
-  And... and... and before you decide on anything, okay?

36:57.130 --> 36:59.150
Okay. Okay.

36:59.380 --> 37:03.340
- "Walden" 
-  Yes. I marked a passage in it.

37:03.660 --> 37:05.970
Ah. I see that.

37:07.950 --> 37:11.210
"If a woman does not keep
pace with her companions,

37:11.360 --> 37:14.650
"perhaps it is because she
hears a different drummer.

37:14.970 --> 37:17.830
"Let her step to the
music which she hears,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.530
however measured or far away."

37:25.810 --> 37:28.780
I like the way you changed the pronouns.

37:29.490 --> 37:31.190
Well, I didn't think Henry would mind.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.930
- Nah. 
- But that's it, Kit.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.910
I think you need to take a moment,

37:36.110 --> 37:38.230
try to hear your own music.

37:38.460 --> 37:42.070
maybe a change of scene...
find a quiet, peaceful spot,

37:42.500 --> 37:44.290
lots of fresh air,clear your mind,

37:44.470 --> 37:46.090
get a new perspective.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.700
Yeah. Yeah, like...
like maybe getting a...

37:48.870 --> 37:51.080
a quaint little cottage in the country

37:51.250 --> 37:52.790
with a garden and a pond

37:53.010 --> 37:55.180
and maybe even a rocker
on the front porch.

37:55.370 --> 37:57.390
and... and maybe there could
be like a fenced-in yard

37:57.560 --> 37:59.560
- for the dogs and Evan. 
- Oh, don't make fun of me.

37:59.740 --> 38:02.540
I'm... I'm not making fun of you.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.480
I want to show you this.

38:06.730 --> 38:07.260
There it is.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.310
Oh.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.590
It's in Ojai.

38:11.780 --> 38:12.850
I rented it for three months.

38:12.970 --> 38:15.480
Oh, Kitty, it's perfect. Look at that.

38:15.670 --> 38:18.060
Hmm. And Ojai... I
love the symmetry of it.

38:18.230 --> 38:19.580
All right, don't overdo it, mother.

38:19.750 --> 38:21.970
- Okay, it's fine. 
- It's fine. It is. It's fine.

38:22.130 --> 38:25.440
- It's very good. 
- It's pretty. But it's... it's scary.

38:25.590 --> 38:28.920
I mean, I... I haven't
lived alone for...

38:29.820 --> 38:32.280
you know, a very,very long time.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.670
Well, why would you be scared?

38:34.840 --> 38:36.600
You're a lifetime member of the N.R.A.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.470
You're armed to the teeth.

38:38.700 --> 38:41.700
No, no, mother. That..
that's not what I'm...

38:41.850 --> 38:44.190
I... what I mean is,
I'm... I'm scared that I'm,

38:44.460 --> 38:46.230
You know, I'm gonna be lonely.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.360
Ah.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.320
Well, you've got Evan.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.150
Yeah, I do. I do.

38:52.380 --> 38:56.170
And if you get really lonely,
I'll let you borrow Justin.

38:57.730 --> 39:00.360
I've already promised,
like,a hundred times

39:00.540 --> 39:01.930
that I'll never do it again.

39:02.190 --> 39:05.170
I know. and I believe you.

39:05.450 --> 39:09.210
But the celebrity and the glamour...

39:09.390 --> 39:11.450
it's pretty seductive,isn't it?

39:11.680 --> 39:13.630
Yeah.

39:13.860 --> 39:16.200
You know who's not
impressed with that stuff?

39:16.380 --> 39:17.100
Grandma.

39:17.290 --> 39:19.390
Yeah. she sees right through it.

39:20.540 --> 39:22.560
If it's any consolation,

39:22.730 --> 39:25.890
you're not the only daughter to
disappoint her mom that night.

39:26.070 --> 39:28.860
- Really? 
- Yeah, really.

39:29.230 --> 39:31.670
You know, sweetheart,
when I was growing up,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.880
mom really set the values in our house.

39:35.070 --> 39:37.740
And we always knew exactly...

39:38.270 --> 39:41.150
what was important.

39:42.150 --> 39:45.300
I want to be that kind of mom for you.

39:45.510 --> 39:48.490
I'm glad you and Luc are are friends.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.840
Our relationship's...

39:51.070 --> 39:53.380
it's a little more
complicated, isn't it?

39:53.610 --> 39:56.650
As much as I love our gal-pal time...

39:57.190 --> 39:58.770
sometimes, I just...

39:59.070 --> 40:02.820
I can't be a friend.

40:03.080 --> 40:07.190
Then I'm guessing you
won't be wanting this.

40:08.780 --> 40:09.670
What's that?

40:09.880 --> 40:14.040
It's a friendship bracelet.
Agatha and I made it for you.

40:14.910 --> 40:17.370
I'm so glad you and
Agatha are friends again.

40:17.630 --> 40:21.600
- Mom, you forced me to make up with her. 
- I know.

40:21.860 --> 40:24.060
But actually, she's...

40:24.230 --> 40:25.970
the only one of my
friends who's visited me

40:26.150 --> 40:27.880
ever since I got grounded.

40:28.090 --> 40:30.730
I love my friendship bracelet.

40:32.260 --> 40:34.380
Thank you, chicken.

40:35.380 --> 40:37.180
# I have traveled #

40:38.780 --> 40:41.080
# to the future #

40:41.320 --> 40:42.030
Are you excited to see your grandmother?

40:42.210 --> 40:44.130
I hope I recognize her.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.600
I haven't seen her since my mom died.

40:45.790 --> 40:46.520
Well, you shoulda heard her on the phone

40:46.720 --> 40:48.780
when I told her we were
driving you up here.

40:48.910 --> 40:51.530
She was so happy, 'cause
she thought she'd lost you.

40:51.990 --> 40:53.540
- Well, this is a nice street, you think? 
- Yeah.

40:53.870 --> 40:55.780
- It's a lot nicer than that group home. 
- Yeah.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.540
I'm so proud of you

40:57.710 --> 40:58.830
for sticking it out at that place

40:59.030 --> 41:01.860
and for trusting me
to find your grandma.

41:02.030 --> 41:03.940
Thanks for... you know.

41:04.110 --> 41:06.550
What, not being cranky? You're welcome.

41:06.930 --> 41:09.890
# and if we wantto break free #

41:10.060 --> 41:12.420
Uh, well, you should probably
head on up. It's time.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.840
Won't you guys go up with me, please?

41:15.010 --> 41:17.560
Uh, later. you go ahead.

41:21.820 --> 41:23.910
Abuela.

41:27.900 --> 41:29.540
Mateo.

41:35.070 --> 41:37.660
This is much better
than any underwear party.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.350
I can tell just by looking at your face

41:40.590 --> 41:41.620
that you love her a lot.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.150
Oh, yeah.

41:43.330 --> 41:45.250
It... it still amazes me

41:45.420 --> 41:47.570
that I somehow convinced
her to fall in love with me.

41:47.790 --> 41:50.810
I was... I was such a
screw-up when I met her,

41:51.060 --> 41:54.510
and she somehow managed
to overlook that.

41:57.330 --> 42:00.180
Is this all right, if
we... if we talk about her?

42:00.350 --> 42:01.820
Oh, yeah. I want to hear.

42:02.140 --> 42:04.720
Okay. Uh, Rebecca has this ability

42:04.900 --> 42:08.060
to... see the best in people.

42:08.490 --> 42:10.810
You see yourself reflected in her face,

42:11.110 --> 42:14.060
and... you want to be that.

42:14.310 --> 42:17.540
And she would... she would
literally bust out laughing

42:17.720 --> 42:18.980
if you get too full of yourself.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.560
I mean, there was a... I
was flexing a couple times,

42:20.720 --> 42:22.700
and boy, I was... it's embarrassing,

42:22.870 --> 42:28.510
but you... you don't care,
because her face lights up.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.460
# and praise the moon,the mountains #

42:31.630 --> 42:34.450
# and the sun #

42:35.305 --> 42:41.277
