WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:05.673
You're the mayor?
Lavon Hayes, the linebacker.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.041
George Tucker.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.476
This why you stopped our
 little frolic the other night?

00:08.476 --> 00:10.744
You got googly eyes
for golden boy George?

00:10.744 --> 00:13.447
LEMON:
 Zoe Hart has flipped some
 New York switch in you,

00:13.447 --> 00:15.383
and you are just not
the same person anymore.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.618
LAVON:
 We are at your
 engagement party.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.753
You know how difficult
this is for me.
Difficult never stopped me.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.622
LEMON:
 This needs to stop.
 I can't handle it.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.624
What do you want from me here?
I'm trying to move on,

00:23.624 --> 00:25.759
and-and you won't let me.
(crying)

00:26.794 --> 00:30.264
* *

00:43.477 --> 00:46.647
Really? Even Christmas
has to be Dixie?

00:46.647 --> 00:49.450
We honor every holiday
in our own BlueBell way.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.119
Santa's sleigh
with a gun rack?

00:51.119 --> 00:53.053
LAVON:
Maybe he hunts deer.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.722
It's a noble hobby.
Yeah, which one?

00:54.722 --> 00:56.724
Donner? Blitzen? Rudolph?

00:56.724 --> 00:58.859
No, no.
Rudolph's nose lights up.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.228
It makes him too easy
to track.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.629
It's unsportsmanlike.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.431
Okay. I'll have them
take it down.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.732
Oh!

01:04.732 --> 01:06.300
"Oh!" what?

01:06.300 --> 01:07.401
Rose and Frederick Dean.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.137
Maybe he dumped
Magnolia Breeland

01:09.137 --> 01:10.471
and he's asking her out.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.906
Do you find it a little odd
how invested you are

01:12.906 --> 01:14.642
in the love lives
of 14-year-olds?

01:17.245 --> 01:19.247
(clears throat)
Okay.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.014
Here we go.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.883
So?
No.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.152
Oh. Then what?

01:24.152 --> 01:25.786
We were just talking
about school.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.855
Fredrick's still
totally into Magnolia,

01:27.855 --> 01:29.390
and I'm still just
the flat-chested nobody

01:29.390 --> 01:31.024
who gives him answers
to our geometry homework.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.393
LAVON:
Are you crazy, Rose?

01:32.393 --> 01:34.995
No, no. You get back out there,
you give him hell.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.097
'Cause winners never quit.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.098
Okay.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.800
No guts, no glory!

01:39.800 --> 01:43.003
What? I spent half my life
in a locker room.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.572
Look, I'm sorry, Rose.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.407
That sucks.
Yeah, and the
worst part is

01:46.407 --> 01:48.176
that everyone knows
Magnolia's a shoe-in

01:48.176 --> 01:49.677
to win the Miss Cinnamon
Cider Pageant,

01:49.677 --> 01:51.679
so now the whole town
will love with her, too.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.181
But hey, I'm on the drama club

01:53.181 --> 01:55.416
tech crew, so I get
to help build the stage

01:55.416 --> 01:56.884
she's gonna win on.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.786
Merry freaking Christmas.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.291
Never say die, Rose!

02:03.291 --> 02:04.458
Okay, stop.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.726
That's all I got.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.828
(sighs)

02:09.463 --> 02:12.366
So I wrapped up
the Maliska case yesterday.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.834
Oh, that's excellent.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.102
(sighs)

02:15.102 --> 02:17.104
Oh, Magnolia still
needs gloves.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.706
We really need to
rethink her accessories.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.474
You know, it's the one
where I was defending the guy

02:20.474 --> 02:21.842
who was falsely accused
of tax fraud?

02:21.842 --> 02:24.545
And of course, we still
need hair and nails.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.347
Do you think we should
drive to Mobile for her hair,

02:26.347 --> 02:27.548
or stay local?
I mean, Mobile

02:27.548 --> 02:29.650
obviously would do
a better job, but

02:29.650 --> 02:31.385
sitting across the salon
from her competition

02:31.385 --> 02:32.686
would definitely
psych them out.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.323
I lost the case.
Judge gave the guy the chair.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.457
That's a shame.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.492
I know.
Wait, what?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.862
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.732
This time of year is
just so crazy for me,

02:44.732 --> 02:47.801
and I have to help Magnolia win
the pageant, just like I did,

02:47.801 --> 02:49.970
and that means that my
workload is doubled now.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.405
Speaking of which, hey,

02:51.405 --> 02:54.041
when is the tree going to be
delivered for town square?

02:54.041 --> 02:55.909
Wade's guy is going
to deliver it this morning.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.679
I still can't believe I let
you talk me into letting Wade

02:58.679 --> 03:01.048
provide the most important
decoration for the town square.

03:01.048 --> 03:05.519
Baby, I promise you are going
to get a beautiful, 18-foot

03:05.519 --> 03:07.054
Douglas fir,
just like you wanted.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.857
Even Wade Kinsella is too scared
of you this time of year

03:09.857 --> 03:11.392
to screw that up. Okay?

03:11.392 --> 03:12.593
MAGNOLIA:
Hey, George.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.661
Hey.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.229
Lemon, I thought we were
going shoe shopping.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.297
We absolutely are.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.198
Shoe shopping.
Sounds like fun.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.400
Okay, baby, please...

03:19.400 --> 03:21.134
try and remember the holidays

03:21.134 --> 03:22.670
are supposed to be about joy.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.572
Okay.
You have a good day.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.275
Thanks for taking me shopping.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.310
But you've got
a lot going on, so...

03:29.310 --> 03:31.245
you can just give me
the money to go alone.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.646
I won't mind.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.883
I'm sure you wouldn't,
but our family legacy

03:35.883 --> 03:37.418
is at stake. Plus...

03:37.418 --> 03:40.954
I want to be there with
you every step of the way,

03:40.954 --> 03:43.824
just like Mama was
for me. Okay?
Okay.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.499
* *

04:01.742 --> 04:03.377
What if I forget
how the dance goes?

04:03.377 --> 04:06.480
Lemon, sweetheart, you've gone
over that dance so many times,

04:06.480 --> 04:07.915
you've worn out the rug.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.249
Oh...

04:09.249 --> 04:10.818
Just be your radiant self,

04:10.818 --> 04:14.688
and trust me, you will win that
Miss Cinnamon Cider Pageant.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.990
Like you did,
when you were my age.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.591
Just like.

04:21.661 --> 04:22.463
Here.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.832
For good luck.

04:30.070 --> 04:34.808
You are gonna wow those judges,
and carry on our family legacy.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.552
Everyone knows a few
minor scrapes and bumps

04:44.552 --> 04:46.954
come with the territory of
rhythmic gymnastics, right?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.756
I guess. Never been
to that territory.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.224
Since it's a sprain, you're
going to have to stay off

04:51.224 --> 04:53.026
your ankle for at
least two days, okay?

04:53.026 --> 04:54.328
Two days? Oh, no, no, no.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.963
She's performing
in tomorrow's pageant.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.032
I'm sorry. I'm sure every
pageant has one injury victim--

04:59.032 --> 05:00.401
you're it.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.270
She was practicing gluing
on her false eyelashes,

05:03.270 --> 05:04.505
for the pageant

05:04.505 --> 05:06.440
Well, now all the boys think

05:06.440 --> 05:07.575
she's winking at them.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.443
Let's just say I have seen

05:09.443 --> 05:10.744
some texts
on her cell phone

05:10.744 --> 05:13.481
that I wish I could un-see.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.649
In my day, regular
batons were enough,

05:15.649 --> 05:17.385
but now everyone
wants flaming.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.854
Four hours of yodeling
practice every day

05:20.854 --> 05:22.122
and now laryngitis!

05:22.122 --> 05:23.391
Can you fix her?

05:23.391 --> 05:25.593
Are you sure you want me to?

05:29.262 --> 05:31.064
Now, Wade, this
Christmas tree

05:31.064 --> 05:32.966
is the centerpiece of Lemon's
town square decorations,

05:32.966 --> 05:34.101
and I promised her...

05:34.101 --> 05:35.669
And I promised you.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.137
For you to doubt me,
George Tucker,

05:37.137 --> 05:38.372
that I'll come through...

05:38.372 --> 05:39.507
well, that hurts my feelings.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.808
Well, I'll tell you this:

05:40.808 --> 05:42.543
Lemon doesn't get that
Christmas tree soon,

05:42.543 --> 05:44.412
your feelings are going
to be the last thing

05:44.412 --> 05:45.579
you should be worried about.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.081
I'm terrified.
I'm just saying.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.683
Hey.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.751
Hey.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.285
Hi.
Hi.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.654
It is 80 degrees out there.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.889
The elves are melting.

05:55.889 --> 05:56.957
I miss New York.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.927
I bet you do, especially
this time of year.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.795
You know, the tree
at Rockefeller Center,

06:01.795 --> 06:04.398
and the smell of chestnuts
roasting in the air...

06:04.398 --> 06:05.933
Yeah.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.536
I guess I'm making
new holiday traditions.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.404
Like sweating through
three pairs of underwear.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.773
(laughs)

06:12.773 --> 06:14.442
ZOE:
Mm-hmm. That happened.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.844
Hey. Listen.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.346
I've been meaning to ask you.
I have this case,

06:19.346 --> 06:20.581
and there's a
medical issue involved,

06:20.581 --> 06:21.915
and I was wondering if you

06:21.915 --> 06:24.918
might want to help me
with some of the research.

06:24.918 --> 06:25.986
Help you? Really?

06:25.986 --> 06:28.155
I mean, it would be like
an unpaid consultant

06:28.155 --> 06:29.690
type of thing, you know.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.725
And I wouldn't want it to
interfere with your work hours

06:31.725 --> 06:34.528
but maybe we could do it
after your office closes.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.329
You know, it should only
take a couple of nights.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.330
I could probably swing that.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.599
Really?
Mm-hmm.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.934
Great. How's, uh...
Tuesday night sound?

06:40.934 --> 06:43.136
I mean,
I promise you we will have

06:43.136 --> 06:45.473
the best takeout that
Fancie's has to offer.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.607
Tuesday sounds great.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.609
There you are, my love.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.744
(clears throat)
What are you two
talking about?

06:50.744 --> 06:53.413
Zoe's just gonna help me out
with that malpractice suit

06:53.413 --> 06:54.848
I was telling you about.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.617
That's fantastic news.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.486
Uh, anyway,
I went shopping

06:58.486 --> 06:59.987
for Magnolia's pageant shoes,

06:59.987 --> 07:02.355
and I found three wonderful
options, but the best part is,

07:02.355 --> 07:04.091
I found a dress

07:04.091 --> 07:05.626
for our rehearsal dinner.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.928
Isn't this the cutest thing?
GEORGE:
Yeah.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.530
Right?
Yeah.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.031
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.467
This must be torture for you,
me talking about my wedding.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.402
Torture? No.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.170
The accent is kind of a

07:17.170 --> 07:19.372
fingernails-on-the-chalkboard
thing, but...

07:19.372 --> 07:21.074
Listen. I just want
to let you know

07:21.074 --> 07:23.511
that it does not make you
any less of a woman

07:23.511 --> 07:26.379
that you yourself
have no wedding plans.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.681
Or a boyfriend.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.149
Or even the prospect of one.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.884
Because that little doctoring
job you have can keep you

07:30.884 --> 07:32.385
busy for years to come, and

07:32.385 --> 07:35.455
we have a great tradition of
dignified spinsters down here.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.858
Lemon.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.062
George. Lemon.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.764
A pleasure, as always.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.737
Rose.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.905
Put down the hammer.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.340
It is time someone showed
those Breeland girls

07:53.340 --> 07:55.275
that there are other people
that matter in this town.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.577
I agree.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.378
Because you are
an incredible girl.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.281
Every bit as deserving of
Fredrick Dean's attention

08:01.281 --> 08:02.415
as Magnolia.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.951
And what better
way to get it

08:03.951 --> 08:07.254
than by winning the Miss
Cinnamon Cider Beauty Pageant.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.689
Come on.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.624
We've got work to do.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.371
and their hair.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.940
Well, I don't want to
go all pageant-y, okay?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.676
I want to wear
my hair like this.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.810
And wear something
really comfortable,

08:29.810 --> 08:31.478
so it's easy for
me to clog in.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.481
I'm sorry, clog?
Mm-hmm. For my talent--
clog dancing.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.183
Oh, but I brought
some other stuff

08:36.183 --> 08:37.751
if you want to see
what else I can do.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.220
Yeah. Let's see that.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.556
(playing tunelessly)

09:10.450 --> 09:11.819
(tapping noisily)

09:26.900 --> 09:29.136
And... clogging it is!

09:30.537 --> 09:32.505
I definitely don't think other
contestants will clog dance,

09:32.505 --> 09:33.807
do you, Lavon?
I hope not.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.410
Uh, I mean, to keep Rose's

09:37.410 --> 09:40.113
competitive edge.
Rose, let's take a break,

09:40.113 --> 09:42.783
and we will talk about it
over lunch. Okay?

09:43.751 --> 09:45.552
(shoes tapping)

09:45.552 --> 09:46.954
She has ten talents,

09:46.954 --> 09:48.822
each one worse
than the one before.

09:48.822 --> 09:52.425
ROSE:
* Silent night *

09:52.425 --> 09:55.696
* Holy night *

09:55.696 --> 09:57.831
(shoes clattering)
* All is calm *

09:57.831 --> 10:00.968
* All is bright.. *

10:00.968 --> 10:02.903
Uh-oh.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.373
"Silent Night"?
Holy crap, you can sing!

10:08.876 --> 10:10.610
She has got the
voice of an angel.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.179
Oh.
Say "ah."

10:12.179 --> 10:13.513
Ah...

10:13.513 --> 10:15.649
But she won't
sing in public.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.618
I have begged, and I have
pleaded, but she's too scared.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.887
I'm just hoping that
with my coaching,

10:19.887 --> 10:21.388
the clog dance will
be enough to win.

10:21.388 --> 10:25.392
Only if by coaching
you mean you're gonna bribe

10:25.392 --> 10:26.526
the judges.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.228
(laughing)

10:28.228 --> 10:29.496
(coughing)

10:29.496 --> 10:32.199
Susie, you have bronchitis.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.734
I'm going to write
you a prescription

10:33.734 --> 10:35.135
and send you home to bed.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.538
Oh, no can do. It's my
busiest time of the year.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.074
So many little pageant
hairs to coif.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.676
Been booked for months.
But listen,

10:42.676 --> 10:45.879
if you want, I can try
to squeeze Rose in

10:45.879 --> 10:48.015
for an appointment tomorrow.
I could make her hair

10:48.015 --> 10:51.184
look like a three-tiered
chocolate sponge cake.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.421
But that pageant
is still gonna be won

10:54.421 --> 10:56.724
by Magnolia Breeland, right?

10:58.792 --> 11:01.228
Katie Lynn just texted me
the funniest news.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.832
Rose Hattenbarger is entering
the Miss Cinnamon Cider Pageant.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.466
Wonder who gave her the idea?

11:06.466 --> 11:08.435
I guess Dr. Hart
is couching her.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.137
Oh, so Zoe Hart is helping her?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.538
I guess.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.807
Okay, let's see-- there
are three judges, right?
Uh-huh.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.575
Delia Ann we know
will vote for you.

11:15.575 --> 11:16.576
Dash DeWitt--

11:16.576 --> 11:17.978
he and Zoe share that same

11:17.978 --> 11:19.246
perverse obsession
with New York City.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.448
He might be harder
to get on our team.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.984
That leaves... the mayor.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.687
(whispers):
The mayor.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.990
Excuse me, darlin'.
Okay.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.926
Lavon.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.763
Yeah?

11:35.763 --> 11:38.265
I understand that
Zoe Hart is helping
Rose with the pageant.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.533
Yeah, I caught that little
item on CNN, too.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.404
I know that you two are friends,
and I assume that a smart man

11:44.404 --> 11:47.007
like you will be objective
in judging the pageant.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.542
I assume a smart
woman like you

11:49.542 --> 11:52.345
wouldn't try to flirt
with one of the judges to
influence his decision.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.548
Flirt? I don't know
what you're insinuating...

11:55.548 --> 11:59.219
Lemon, I will vote for whomever
I think is the best girl.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.354
And I resent you using
our personal history

12:01.354 --> 12:05.859
to try and change that.
I was doing no such...

12:05.859 --> 12:07.761
You are an arrogant ass.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.596
Well, you are a
manipulative little...

12:09.596 --> 12:11.364
Don't...!

12:11.364 --> 12:13.967
Don't you dare.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.474
I do not care who elected you.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.144
This is not the way that
a Nativity should look.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.914
Miss Breeland, now maybe if you
stop shouting for one minute,

12:26.914 --> 12:28.715
I could help you
with your problem.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.518
My problem, Mr. Mayor, is that
a raccoon broke into the manger

12:31.518 --> 12:34.855
in the middle of the night and
at the arm off the baby Jesus.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.757
As if he didn't suffer enough.
Well, I'm sure we can fix it.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.459
The point is,
that your new administration

12:39.459 --> 12:41.995
is dropping the ball
on matters of security.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.865
Security? Ma'am, I am
the mayor, okay,

12:44.865 --> 12:46.433
not the raccoon catcher.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.436
That right there is the reason
why no one I know voted for you.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.605
Because you don't know where
your priorities should be.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.041
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:54.041 --> 12:56.609
I have to papier-mâché
an arm back onto our savior.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.278
Do what you have
to do, ma'am.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.480
I mean, I was trying
to help, and...

13:02.649 --> 13:04.384
Miss Breeland?

13:13.060 --> 13:14.694
Wade, I got your call.

13:14.694 --> 13:15.929
Please tell me
this emergency

13:15.929 --> 13:17.430
has nothing to do with
the Christmas tree.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.900
Okay, so I got the tree,
and, uh, and, uh,

13:19.900 --> 13:22.936
and it's a Doug fir,
just like you...
just like you wanted.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.072
Great.
Well, it's not exactly

13:25.072 --> 13:27.040
to specifications.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.511
George, I swear to God,

13:31.511 --> 13:33.180
I told the guy 18 feet.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.848
But maybe he's got that

13:34.848 --> 13:36.783
number disease
where you hear...

13:36.783 --> 13:38.852
There's no disease
like that, Wade.

13:38.852 --> 13:39.920
Could be.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.388
Oh, my God, I promised Lemon

13:41.388 --> 13:43.823
a huge Christmas tree
for town square.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.358
This is...
She's going to freak out.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.327
It's not a problem, man,
I got another connection.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.795
This guy-- he's
got tons of trees.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.597
Big ones.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.764
You can see them from space.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.068
You just come by later
with your truck,

13:55.068 --> 13:56.803
and we'll go get one.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.071
Hey, you know who'd love
this tree?

13:58.071 --> 14:00.607
Charlie Brown
is a cartoon character, Wade.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.343
Yeah, you're probably right.

14:04.878 --> 14:08.448
I tell you, Ashley,
the South is dead.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.549
It's dead.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.385
The Yankees and the
carpetbaggers have got it,

14:12.385 --> 14:13.820
and there's nothing
left for us.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.422
Oh, Ashley...

14:21.561 --> 14:23.730
LEMON:
That's good enough
for now, Magnolia.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.432
Don't want you
to get stale.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.334
(quietly):
It's in the bag.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.503
Hey, Frederick.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.306
Oh, hey, Rose.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.075
She's great, isn't she?

14:35.075 --> 14:36.843
Magnolia's a born actress.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.311
Oh, guess what?

14:38.311 --> 14:40.580
I was going through
Dash DeWitt's video history,

14:40.580 --> 14:43.250
and Gone with the Wind
is his favorite movie.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.055
Magnolia, that was awesome.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.258
You're like as good
as Katherine Heigl.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.793
Let me get you
a beverage.
Okay.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.663
Oh, Rose Hattenbarger.

14:56.663 --> 15:00.000
Get your own contest,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.502
and your own boyfriend.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.204
Mm-hmm. Bye.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.611
Frederick doesn't want me.
He never will.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.147
I don't know why I'm even
in this competition.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.548
I'm never going to win.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.757
Another chicken popper, Dash?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.159
Now you've already let me

15:26.159 --> 15:27.927
eat most of them.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.496
(chuckles)

15:29.496 --> 15:31.831
Hey, you know, I'm helping
my friend, Rose Hattenbarger,

15:31.831 --> 15:33.700
with the beauty pageant.
Oh.

15:33.700 --> 15:37.004
We were just saying how
generous it is of you to
volunteer to be a judge.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.471
Giving up your
valuable time.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.507
Doing... whatever it
is that you do.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.509
Dr. Hart, I'll let you in
on a little secret.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.711
I'm a sucker for a girl
in a sparkly dress.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.346
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.216
Which would explain why I saw
 La Cage Aux Folles 16 times.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.717
I'm sure.
Mm-hmm.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.520
You know, it just so happens
that my mother is a publicist,

15:53.520 --> 15:55.688
and one of her clients
is Bernadette Peters.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.124
(gasps)

15:57.124 --> 16:00.360
I love, love, love me
some Bernadette.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.794
Next time you're in New York,

16:01.794 --> 16:04.797
maybe I can have my mom
arrange for a backstage visit

16:04.797 --> 16:06.333
with Ms. Peters.
Dr. Hart--

16:06.333 --> 16:09.169
if I didn't know
any better,

16:09.169 --> 16:12.672
I'd say you're trying
to bribe me into voting
for your friend Rose.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.674
Bribe? No.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.444
Well, I'm sorry,
but I cannot be bought.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.012
Good day.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.154
Rose, it's Zoe.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.821
You need to start
picturing yourself

16:28.821 --> 16:31.558
doing the clog dance number
in a sparkly dress.

16:32.359 --> 16:36.029
Wade, these are the woods.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.831
You said this was
a Christmas tree farm.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.300
No, I implied it was.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.203
These woods belong to the
dad of a girl I used to...

16:43.203 --> 16:45.905
be cozy with.
He and I became buddies.

16:45.905 --> 16:50.043
He's not going to give a damn
if we take one of his trees.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.882
You want to talk to me
about this?

16:55.882 --> 16:58.251
No. It's Lemon's. Put it back.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.956
Okay, so who's this girl that
you used to be cozy with?

17:03.956 --> 17:06.925
Her name was Stella.
Owns a bait shop.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.494
No one special.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.597
Yeah, well, that goes
without saying, doesn't it?

17:10.597 --> 17:13.200
I mean, geez, Wade, you have
been with a lot of women.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.202
I mean, there was
Tina the stripper...

17:15.202 --> 17:17.436
I'm sorry, I'm sorry--
the exotic dancer.

17:17.436 --> 17:19.806
No, my friend,
Tina was a stripper.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.509
Vicki Carter, Diane Knox, the
Hollis twins, both of them.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.542
They were twins?

17:23.542 --> 17:25.545
I thought I was just
really drunk.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.280
I think you've
been with pretty much

17:27.280 --> 17:29.082
every single woman in this town.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.517
And you've
been with the same one

17:30.517 --> 17:31.751
for the last
eight billion years.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.488
And now your truck
is her cosmetics case.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.024
So whose life is better,
I ask you?

17:38.024 --> 17:39.426
Oh, I get it, Wade.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.060
You think you're having
a good time,

17:41.060 --> 17:42.595
think you're having
a lot of fun,

17:42.595 --> 17:44.964
but seriously, you ever thought
of just finding a nice girl

17:44.964 --> 17:46.499
and actually settling down?

17:46.499 --> 17:48.635
What is this,
 The Oprah Show?

17:48.635 --> 17:49.902
Look, do me a favor.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.472
Pull the truck over
and let's chop down a tree.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.706
Fine.

17:55.975 --> 17:59.078
Maybe that was your lipstick.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.687
I went to the dress shop.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.422
They were all out
of Rose's size.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.658
Dotty told me that
you bought them all.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.393
I wanted Magnolia
to have choices.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.694
Yeah? Well, guess what?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.563
I am so glad that you bought
all those dresses

18:16.563 --> 18:18.465
because I've got this hot
little Chloe in my closet

18:18.465 --> 18:20.933
with Rose's name all over it.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.204
The pageant legacy of the
perfect Southern Breeland girls

18:24.204 --> 18:26.339
ends this year.

18:33.546 --> 18:37.317
Rose, forget clog dancing.
You're going to have to sing.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.653
(chain saw roaring)
George, are you...?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.555
What is that noise?

18:42.555 --> 18:45.192
Babe, babe, I'm in the car.

18:45.192 --> 18:48.861
No, that's-- that's just some
idiot on a motorcycle.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.831
No, babe, look, I'm going to
have to call you back, okay?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.766
All right, love you.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.575
Hi, George.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.445
Um, I know that I agreed
not to call you

19:05.445 --> 19:08.781
while you're working up there
in New York, but...

19:08.781 --> 19:11.584
Hey, I'm right in the middle
of a settlement conference.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.153
Is this urgent,
or can I call you back?

19:14.153 --> 19:17.023
Yes, sure. Bye.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.292
I'm really sorry.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.928
I'll call you later, okay?
I love you.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.535
(sobbing)

19:31.338 --> 19:34.507
Excuse me, Miss Breeland.

19:35.308 --> 19:38.110
Miss Breeland,

19:38.110 --> 19:40.079
you-you all right?

19:40.079 --> 19:41.814
I'm fine.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.183
I'm fine.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.387
I-I know we barely
know each other,

19:47.387 --> 19:50.790
but sometimes it's
easier to talk

19:50.790 --> 19:52.925
to a stranger.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.868
So you're upset because
a critic didn't like

20:01.868 --> 20:04.471
the Daphne Theater Company's
revival of A Doll's House?

20:04.471 --> 20:07.307
The doll in that photo
is my mother.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.478
She left us 12 years ago.

20:12.912 --> 20:17.384
Said she wanted to pursue
her career as an actress.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.120
She never came back.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.257
All this time
I thought

20:24.257 --> 20:25.858
maybe her dreams had come true.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.928
Because...

20:28.928 --> 20:32.932
why else wouldn't you contact
your husband?

20:32.932 --> 20:35.935
But it turns out that
she's 30 miles away.

20:35.935 --> 20:40.873
And not once did she bother
to contact us.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.010
Not once.

20:44.010 --> 20:47.013
I'm sorry.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.348
That is awful.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.916
She is awful.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.921
Well, I am never going to think
about that woman

20:54.921 --> 20:57.023
for the rest of my life.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.134
I-I know that things

21:08.134 --> 21:12.305
may seem confusing and wrong,

21:12.305 --> 21:14.307
but she was your mother.

21:14.307 --> 21:18.311
You can't not
think about it.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.513
She had this way
of making me feel

21:20.513 --> 21:26.018
like I was the most important
thing in the whole world.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.254
And I loved her so much.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.923
She used to call me
her little angel.

21:30.923 --> 21:34.661
Uh, Miss Breeland,
I'm so sorry.

21:34.661 --> 21:38.498
(sobbing)

21:48.040 --> 21:51.010
Well, I do have

21:51.010 --> 21:52.479
to hand it to you.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.280
The tree is pretty awesome.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.149
Well, don't thank me,
thank Stella from the bait shop.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.953
See, my friend, playing the
field does have its benefits.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.221
Take your word for it.

22:02.221 --> 22:04.857
Yeah, well,
Lemon's gonna be...

22:04.857 --> 22:06.158
(siren whoops)

22:06.158 --> 22:08.395
(car approaching)

22:17.203 --> 22:18.705
Evening, Sheriff.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.239
There, uh...
seem to be a problem?

22:20.239 --> 22:21.508
Oh, yeah.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.842
There's a big problem.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.644
Should've known
it was you, Kinsella.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.045
Oh, hey there, Mr. Reese.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.847
How's Stella doing?

22:27.847 --> 22:28.981
Just fine.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.250
Ever since I said
if you ever saw you her again,

22:31.250 --> 22:32.819
I'd shoot you dead.

22:34.153 --> 22:37.990
Okay, maybe her dad
didn't exactly love me.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.058
You're under arrest.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.461
I'm thinking about running.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.731
Do... not... run.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.365
Okay.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.513
I'm sorry.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.515
About losing my
temper earlier.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.484
You were right.

23:04.484 --> 23:07.219
I might've been flirting.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.788
Shouldn't have.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.823
I shouldn't have
reacted that way.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.560
I know how charged
this time of year

23:13.560 --> 23:16.429
is for you, emotionally.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.431
Have you told your daddy?

23:18.431 --> 23:20.567
Anyone? About...
what you found out

23:20.567 --> 23:22.134
about your mama last year?

23:22.134 --> 23:23.970
I prefer not to think about it.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.139
If I do,
I'll just remember the woman

23:27.139 --> 23:30.777
I spent my whole life looking
up to was a coward and a liar.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.579
We can't pretend
to understand

23:32.579 --> 23:34.313
what makes people do
the things they do.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.483
But shame can be a hard thing.

23:36.483 --> 23:39.752
I mean, she left her
family to be a big star.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.454
Maybe she doesn't know
how to face you.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.590
Well, that's just her loss,
isn't it?

23:43.590 --> 23:45.892
Yeah, it is.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.598
Lemon...

23:51.598 --> 23:53.866
I'm here...

23:53.866 --> 23:55.802
if you ever need
to talk about it.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.973
Thank you.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.176
You always know what to say.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.693
* Let earth receive her king! *

24:20.693 --> 24:22.962
You forgot again.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.031
Receive... right?

24:25.031 --> 24:29.368
Like you are the earth,
receiving its king.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.403
* Receive her king *

24:31.403 --> 24:32.872
* Let ev... *

24:32.872 --> 24:35.842
Do you really think that I
should sing a Christmas carol?

24:35.842 --> 24:37.910
Dash DeWitt
is the swing vote, okay?

24:37.910 --> 24:40.813
Magnolia is doing a monologue
from Gone with the Wind--

24:40.813 --> 24:43.149
which, apparently, Dash
just loves, loves, loves.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.817
He loves, loves, loves
show tunes, too.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.385
Why don't I sing a show tune?

24:46.385 --> 24:48.655
We're already skating on thin
ice with the sparkly dress.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.657
Come on, Rose,
let's go over it again.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.125
But this time,
I want some emotion.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.894
(sighs)

24:54.894 --> 24:57.463
The Yankees and the
carpetbaggers have got it,

24:57.463 --> 25:00.199
and there's nothing
left for us!

25:00.199 --> 25:02.268
Oh, Ashley!

25:02.268 --> 25:03.402
Tears?

25:03.402 --> 25:04.503
Where are the tears?

25:04.503 --> 25:07.406
I don't know how
to get tears.

25:07.406 --> 25:08.675
Well, then pull a nose hair!

25:08.675 --> 25:10.009
Magnolia, come on!

25:10.009 --> 25:11.778
You can do it. You can hit
that note, if you try.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.080
* Her king! *

25:14.080 --> 25:15.915
Yes!
No!

25:15.915 --> 25:19.686
Scarlett would never have
her arms down by her side.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.554
Like this--
hm-- okay.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.522
Her arms would be out here,

25:23.522 --> 25:26.258
like the delicate wings
of a bird.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.359
Now do it like that!

25:27.359 --> 25:28.527
Exactly like that.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.762
Loud,
like you want them

25:29.762 --> 25:30.963
to hear you
in the next county!

25:30.963 --> 25:32.498
Do you think we could
take a break?

25:32.498 --> 25:33.666
Sure.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.867
We could take a fiver.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.302
We could talk about your hair.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.838
How are you
going to do it?
Just like this.

25:38.838 --> 25:40.973
Why? What do you think?

25:43.475 --> 25:45.211
Serious?
You never saw Transporter?

25:45.211 --> 25:47.580
No.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.181
How about
 Transporter 2?
No!

25:52.619 --> 25:54.253
What about Transporter 3?

25:54.253 --> 25:56.355
Wade...

25:56.355 --> 25:58.190
it has been a long night.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.892
I am tired.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.261
I do not feel like
talking right now.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.731
For the millionth time,
George, I'm sorry, okay?

26:04.731 --> 26:07.133
For what,
specifically, Wade?

26:07.133 --> 26:08.534
Is it, getting me a
baby Christmas tree?

26:08.534 --> 26:09.969
Lying about being
best buds with the guy

26:09.969 --> 26:11.638
whose tree we ripped off?

26:11.638 --> 26:14.073
Hey, I...
Oh, no, no, no...

26:14.073 --> 26:16.008
You're sorry for mouthing off
to the sheriff,

26:16.008 --> 26:17.877
and making him
deny us on bail.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.646
That sheriff
was a righteous...

26:19.646 --> 26:21.013
You just need
to stop-- please?

26:21.013 --> 26:22.982
Anyway, I think he violated
some kind of law

26:22.982 --> 26:24.250
by taking away our phones.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.418
I should have been able
to call my lawyer.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.553
Your lawyer was hanging on

26:27.553 --> 26:29.055
to the other end
of a Christmas tree

26:29.055 --> 26:30.322
that you tricked him
into stealing.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.258
I mean, God, Wade!

26:32.258 --> 26:33.860
You know, you never
cease to amaze me,

26:33.860 --> 26:36.929
'cause you're immaturity
knows no bounds!

26:36.929 --> 26:39.498
Oh, oh, I'm sorry,
'cause you're perfect,

26:39.498 --> 26:40.900
aren't you, golden boy?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.835
Oh, no, wait--
I seem to recall

26:42.835 --> 26:45.705
you shooting yourself in the
damn leg with a crossbow.

26:45.705 --> 26:46.839
And I seem to recall
it was in the process

26:46.839 --> 26:48.875
of saving your stupid life.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.409
Well, good thing
you were there, huh?

26:50.409 --> 26:51.610
You're damn right it was.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.779
Over at Zoe Hart's house.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.846
At midnight.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.381
Just... Just... the two of you.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.652
Yeah, that's a long story.

26:59.652 --> 27:02.054
Oh...

27:02.054 --> 27:03.756
Well, you know what?
That's nice.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.792
Because I love stories.

27:07.226 --> 27:11.397
Gentlemen, you can call
someone to pick you up now.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.065
And keep the tree.

27:13.065 --> 27:16.068
Mr. Reese has dropped
all the charges.

27:16.068 --> 27:20.006
And I hope the night in jail
has taught you boys a lesson.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.208
Why, yes, Sheriff, it's taught
me an invaluable lesson.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.943
It taught me
that you're a horse's...

27:23.943 --> 27:25.912
Yes, sir. It did, sir.
Thank you so much.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.880
And it will not
happen again.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.717
(mouthing)

27:31.383 --> 27:32.785
Ow!

27:34.420 --> 27:35.722
Thank you.

27:35.722 --> 27:38.357
I'm not talking Dolly Parton
big, you know,

27:38.357 --> 27:39.959
but you just need
something that screams:

27:39.959 --> 27:42.128
Hair! Hair!
Like, screams it, you know?

27:42.128 --> 27:43.162
Yeah.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.797
Susie can do it.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.267
That is not good

27:48.267 --> 27:49.702
for so many reasons.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.871
LEMON:
What?!

27:51.871 --> 27:53.339
Could've been any doctor.

27:53.339 --> 27:57.143
I cannot believe that you
would have Susie Collins

27:57.143 --> 27:59.779
close up her shop so
that Magnolia can't
get her hair done.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.848
Susie closed her shop
because she's sick.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.215
I cannot believe that
you bought up

28:03.215 --> 28:04.917
every single dress
in Rose's size.

28:04.917 --> 28:08.587
Me?! How about you taking
Dash DeWitt to dinner!

28:08.587 --> 28:10.056
Whole town saw you!

28:10.056 --> 28:12.725
You started it, with the
Scarlett O'Hara monologue!

28:12.725 --> 28:15.294
This pageant is
important to my family.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.963
I respect its integrity,

28:16.963 --> 28:19.832
just like I respect
the integrity of marriage.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.633
And engagements.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.635
What is that
supposed to mean?

28:23.635 --> 28:25.471
It means that everybody knows

28:25.471 --> 28:27.406
that you have been making eyes
at George Tucker.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.941
What? That is insane.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.676
Listen good, Missy--

28:30.676 --> 28:33.846
you can steal my daddy's medical
practice and this pageant,

28:33.846 --> 28:36.115
but you are not gonna steal
my fiancé!

28:36.115 --> 28:39.451
It is not my fault that your
fiancé is flirting with me.

28:39.451 --> 28:40.987
Maybe there's
something about me that

28:40.987 --> 28:43.289
he just isn't
finding in you.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.825
You are... low.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.727
And short!

28:48.727 --> 28:49.796
Well, you... are pale!

28:49.796 --> 28:51.597
And you are only
gonna get paler,

28:51.597 --> 28:54.233
when my girl Rose here wi...

29:02.775 --> 29:04.343
(sighs)

29:10.249 --> 29:13.252
* *

29:18.457 --> 29:20.326
(clears throat)

29:20.326 --> 29:21.928
Remember me?

29:21.928 --> 29:23.595
I used to be Zoe Hart,

29:23.595 --> 29:24.964
levelheaded doctor.

29:24.964 --> 29:28.300
Then Dr. Hart turned
into Miss Hyde.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.602
I don't want to be a pawn
in your war with Lemon.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.739
I am done with
Miss Cinnamon Cider.

29:33.739 --> 29:35.141
You're right.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.409
I did turn this into a battle
between Lemon and me.

29:37.409 --> 29:41.047
But it is not just her
that I am mad at.

29:41.047 --> 29:44.583
I am so sorry
I disappointed you.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.518
Please stay in the pageant.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.387
You wear whatever
you want.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.890
You keep your hair
exactly how it is.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.325
And you clog your way
into first place.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.465
Well, I guess I better
go get ready then.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.636
(phone beeps on)

30:04.636 --> 30:06.438
(clears throat)

30:06.438 --> 30:07.907
George, it's Zoe.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.608
Can you meet me
at my office later?

30:09.608 --> 30:11.377
We need to talk.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.545
* *

30:15.781 --> 30:17.850
Magnolia!

30:18.750 --> 30:20.853
Magnolia!

30:20.853 --> 30:24.023
You see, Lemon darling,
I never had a doubt

30:24.023 --> 30:25.257
that you would win
that pageant!

30:25.257 --> 30:26.658
I don't know why
I was so scared!

30:26.658 --> 30:28.460
Of course I won!
Just like you!

30:28.460 --> 30:30.196
And I'm gonna go on,

30:30.196 --> 30:31.864
and I'm gonna be
head cheerleader like you,

30:31.864 --> 30:33.165
and I'm gonna find
a handsome husband,

30:33.165 --> 30:35.767
maybe a doctor
or a lawyer,

30:35.767 --> 30:37.336
and we're gonna have
two children

30:37.336 --> 30:38.737
and raise them
here in BlueBell.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.873
Just like my mama.

30:41.874 --> 30:44.310
Lemon, sweetheart,
there is nothing wrong

30:44.310 --> 30:46.012
with being a wife
and a mother,

30:46.012 --> 30:48.547
but you-- oh, sweetie--

30:48.547 --> 30:51.918
you have that fire burning
inside you, just like me.

30:51.918 --> 30:54.086
And you are gonna want
more out of life,

30:54.086 --> 30:57.156
and you should let
yourself have it.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.225
'Cause if you don't...

30:59.225 --> 31:05.297
well, that is a disappointment
you will live with forever.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.439
You were looking for me?

31:16.375 --> 31:20.812
Magnolia, I am so sorry
for pushing you so hard.

31:20.812 --> 31:24.383
This pageant, this day,

31:24.383 --> 31:27.853
just hold so much
meaning for me,

31:27.853 --> 31:29.655
just like it did for mama.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.723
But mama's gone, Lemon.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.525
I know, sweetheart.
I know.

31:33.525 --> 31:39.231
And I wish you all the luck
in the world tonight.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.467
And I love you so much.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.003
I love you, too.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.938
But there's somewhere
I need to go.

31:45.938 --> 31:48.107
So, you...

31:48.107 --> 31:49.908
you wow them, Magpie.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.710
Oh, I will.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.512
(laughs)

32:00.987 --> 32:02.421
Well, who's the message from?

32:02.421 --> 32:03.889
Lavon?

32:03.889 --> 32:05.757
Is he coming
to get us, or not?

32:05.757 --> 32:09.095
No, it was actually
from, uh...

32:09.095 --> 32:11.197
It was from Zoe.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.264
Oh.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.632
Right.

32:13.632 --> 32:16.002
Secret plans with
the secret girlfriend.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.104
Just lay off, all right?

32:18.104 --> 32:19.871
I mean, why are we even
talking about this?

32:19.871 --> 32:22.041
We're talking about it,
George,

32:22.041 --> 32:24.110
'cause what you're doing stinks.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.511
Ever since Zoe
moved here,

32:25.511 --> 32:27.179
she hasn't gone out
with a single guy.

32:27.179 --> 32:28.614
Why? 'Cause you...

32:28.614 --> 32:31.150
you keep leading her on
with all your stupid flirting.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.019
Well, guess what?

32:33.019 --> 32:34.053
Unless you're planning
on scrapping

32:34.053 --> 32:35.387
your wedding plans
with Lemon,

32:35.387 --> 32:38.257
just back off
from Zoe Hart, okay?

32:38.257 --> 32:39.825
I don't understand why you
care about this so much,

32:39.825 --> 32:43.462
but there is nothing going on
between me and Zoe Hart.

32:45.764 --> 32:50.702
Okay, I admit,
there may be some sparks there.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.339
But it's only because she
reminds me of New York City,

32:53.339 --> 32:55.041
and yes... we may have flirted.

32:55.041 --> 32:57.043
A little. And I shouldn't have.

32:57.043 --> 32:58.477
But let's get this straight.
I am engaged

32:58.477 --> 33:01.947
to Lemon Breeland, and nothing
is going to change that.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.649
You see, we love each other.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.084
And nothing, and no one,

33:05.084 --> 33:07.053
can compete with
the history that we have.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.355
We are going to be together.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.090
And we are going
to stay together.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.092
Forever.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.660
You got that?

33:15.694 --> 33:18.697
All right, then.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.156
ALICE:
Okay, you two.
Come on in for supper.

33:44.156 --> 33:48.127
Oh. You guys did
a fantastic job.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.828
Frosty's so sparkly.

33:49.828 --> 33:50.962
(loud kiss)

33:50.962 --> 33:52.564
Beautiful.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.502
I just love all
the sparkles.
(giggles)

33:56.502 --> 34:00.439
All right, my little angel,
let's go inside for supper.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.587
and flirty with someone when you
are clearly with someone else.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.824
It's misleading, it's
frustrating, and it's not fair.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.592
And I should have never let
myself get swept away in it.

34:22.494 --> 34:23.329
Huh?

34:23.329 --> 34:25.531
I mean, Rose shouldn't have.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.833
I mean...

34:27.833 --> 34:30.469
in case you didn't know,
Fredrick, Rose likes you.

34:30.469 --> 34:33.139
But you are in a relationship
with Magnolia,

34:33.139 --> 34:35.005
which is fine, then
be in that relationship,

34:35.005 --> 34:36.507
and stop trying to
have it both ways.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.777
Because you are
not worth her time.

34:38.777 --> 34:41.513
She deserves to move on, and
she deserves to have a life.

34:42.648 --> 34:45.684
I just came in 'cause
I have a sore throat.

34:47.719 --> 34:48.853
Right.

34:48.853 --> 34:49.987
Sorry.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.190
Let's have a look.

34:57.996 --> 35:00.199
(gasps, sobs)

35:04.870 --> 35:06.872
(knocking)

35:10.976 --> 35:12.811
Mayor Hayes.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.146
What a surprise.

35:14.146 --> 35:16.348
May I come in?
Please.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.084
Hi.

35:19.084 --> 35:21.620
Hi.
I'm...

35:21.620 --> 35:23.722
I'm sorry to just show
up here unannounced.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.757
It's no problem.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.126
Uh, I-I was thinking about

35:28.126 --> 35:29.761
the-the talk we had,
by the lake,

35:29.761 --> 35:32.798
and I know you're angry at her
because she came back here

35:32.798 --> 35:35.167
and didn't get
in touch with you.

35:35.167 --> 35:37.336
I mean, who wouldn't be, right?

35:37.336 --> 35:39.805
But no matter how
angry you are,

35:39.805 --> 35:41.440
you should never throw away
something that was

35:41.440 --> 35:45.211
given to you out
of love, so...

35:48.847 --> 35:52.618
You have to remember, she
left here for her own reasons.

35:52.618 --> 35:54.453
It had nothing to do with you.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.555
And-and I know you'll
always love her.

35:56.555 --> 35:59.024
I mean, she's your mama, you...

35:59.024 --> 36:02.160
you can't help that.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.230
But that necklace
she gave you

36:04.230 --> 36:06.865
says it all.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.800
She loved you, too.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.673
Thank you.

36:19.110 --> 36:21.146
I g-guess I should
be going, now.

36:21.146 --> 36:23.349
You should.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.719
* *

36:56.214 --> 36:58.216
Hey.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.552
Hey.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.554
Sorry it's so late.
I had to, uh...

37:02.554 --> 37:04.956
put up a Christmas tree.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.792
Right. No problem.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.395
So what'd you
want to talk about?
You know what?

37:09.395 --> 37:11.597
I think I worked
it out myself.

37:11.597 --> 37:13.599
Oh.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.635
Okay.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.037
And, George...

37:19.037 --> 37:21.473
that medical consultation thing?

37:22.708 --> 37:24.610
I just don't think
it's something I can do.

37:24.610 --> 37:27.913
You know what, that's...

37:27.913 --> 37:29.981
probably a good idea.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.754
Bye, Zoe.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.591
Bye, George.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.874
Lemon.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.343
You okay?

37:57.343 --> 37:59.545
Lavon, I know
I shouldn't be here.

37:59.545 --> 38:02.414
But I went to go see my...

38:02.414 --> 38:05.283
mother, and...

38:05.283 --> 38:07.319
it wasn't what I expected.

38:07.319 --> 38:09.154
She... she wasn't alone.

38:09.154 --> 38:12.358
It was... terrible.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.826
Um...

38:14.826 --> 38:17.929
May I come in
for a minute, please?

38:19.965 --> 38:22.434
Uh, Lemon...

38:22.434 --> 38:24.703
I can see that
you're hurting--

38:24.703 --> 38:28.540
and please know that this
is killing me to say this--

38:28.540 --> 38:30.509
but this isn't right.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.445
No, I can't...

38:33.445 --> 38:34.846
be here for you
like this anymore

38:34.846 --> 38:36.415
when you're going
to marry someone else.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.949
Lavon, please...

38:37.949 --> 38:40.018
If you have something meaningful
that you need to talk about,

38:40.018 --> 38:42.954
the person that you need to talk
about it with is your fiancé.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.626
I'm sorry.

38:47.626 --> 38:48.927
(sobs)

38:48.927 --> 38:50.061
I'm sorry.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.063
* *

39:04.042 --> 39:06.044
* *

39:22.193 --> 39:24.396
* *

39:46.317 --> 39:48.520
* *

40:16.815 --> 40:18.817
* *

40:42.307 --> 40:43.575
Hey, Wade.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.479
That was...

40:47.479 --> 40:48.980
quite the clog dance.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.649
She was amazing.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.487
Well, you showed her how to be.

40:58.323 --> 41:01.092
Thanks.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.230
I'm going over to the
Rammer Jammer.

41:07.365 --> 41:08.934
Can I buy you a drink?

41:11.737 --> 41:14.640
It's been a really long day.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.843
Rain check?

41:22.614 --> 41:24.816
