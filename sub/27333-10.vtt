LESLIE:
Previously, on Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.770 --> 00:12.107
I'm shutting the Church down.
Effective immediately.

00:12.191 --> 00:14.863
-You can't do this.
-Your services are no longer required.

00:14.947 --> 00:17.911
We have a problem,
and its name is Leslie Ellerh Dean.

00:17.994 --> 00:20.457
-We build our own weapons.
-Turn on our kids?

00:20.542 --> 00:21.710
If it's the only way.

00:23.171 --> 00:24.550
[gasps]

00:24.633 --> 00:25.969
What are you doing in here?

00:26.052 --> 00:28.933
STACEY: Trying to find our kids who are
under attack, and we have to fight back.

00:29.016 --> 00:31.647
Fight? Sweetie, that's so not you.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.233
STACEY:
Or, it's exactly me.

00:33.316 --> 00:34.695
[gasps]

00:35.487 --> 00:39.412
Can we just start over? Maybe figuring out
what's wrong with Old Lace.

00:39.495 --> 00:41.584
-[gasps]
-CHASE: Gert!

00:41.667 --> 00:44.171
I don't get it.
It's like they're both sick or...dying.

00:44.255 --> 00:45.967
MOLLY:
Wake up!

00:46.050 --> 00:48.430
I'm the guy that knows you framed
Darius Davis for murder.

00:48.514 --> 00:49.975
AWOL:
You just messed up.

00:50.058 --> 00:51.979
NICO:
Pause.

00:52.062 --> 00:53.440
-AWOL: We got a deal or what?
-LIVVIE: No way.

00:53.524 --> 00:54.693
-ALEX: Deal.
-Alex!

00:54.776 --> 00:57.489
The strike team remains intact,
under a new leader.

00:57.574 --> 00:59.493
And clearly AWOL wants the job.

00:59.578 --> 01:02.291
Trust is such a valuable thing,
and you have mine.

01:02.374 --> 01:04.378
-Where are you? I've been waiting.
-AWOL: Change of plans, Alex.

01:04.462 --> 01:05.506
I'm in charge now.

01:05.590 --> 01:08.011
First order of business,
find those damn kids.

01:09.221 --> 01:11.059
-[screams]
-Ain't no point in running.

01:11.142 --> 01:14.190
-She's coming with me.
-We had a deal! Livvie!

01:15.275 --> 01:16.444
LIVVIE: Hello?!

01:18.073 --> 01:20.494
You can't hold me in here!
I didn't do anything!

01:23.166 --> 01:25.170
[footsteps approach]

01:25.253 --> 01:26.799
AWOL: Shit.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.436
I was kind enough
to bring your ass a beverage.

01:38.864 --> 01:41.745
And you repay me
by making all this noise?

01:41.829 --> 01:44.166
[grunts]

01:44.250 --> 01:46.170
Great manners.

01:46.254 --> 01:47.297
I want to see a lawyer.

01:47.381 --> 01:48.592
This isn't that kind of a situation.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.095
LIVVIE:
What kind of a situation is it?

01:50.178 --> 01:54.019
Well, no one really knows
that you're here.

01:56.190 --> 01:59.155
It's just you...and me.

02:01.159 --> 02:03.581
And I can't let you go
until you help me with something.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.254
-What?
-[sighs]

02:07.337 --> 02:11.345
I promised your boyfriend's parents that
I'd bring him and his little friends home.

02:12.974 --> 02:15.605
If you want to go home again,

02:15.688 --> 02:17.734
all you gotta do is tell me
where they're hiding.

02:17.817 --> 02:20.071
I'm not telling you shit.
You don't scare me.

02:20.155 --> 02:22.367
That's because
I ain't been trying to scare you.

02:23.537 --> 02:25.081
But if I wanted to scare you...

02:28.296 --> 02:29.298
I'd do this.

02:29.381 --> 02:31.637
[phone beeps rings]

02:31.720 --> 02:33.223
TAMAR:
Please, no!

02:33.306 --> 02:35.435
-AWOL: Mitch, you there?
-TAMAR: Please!

02:35.520 --> 02:37.397
-MITCH: Yeah, I'm here.
-[baby crying]

02:37.481 --> 02:39.528
Tamar!

02:39.611 --> 02:41.072
Help us, please!

02:41.155 --> 02:43.326
-No! Stop!
-AWOL: Whoa, whoa!

02:43.409 --> 02:45.163
Stop!

02:45.247 --> 02:46.875
Hey, yo, Mitch.
Go ahead and take the baby.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.086
No, no, no!

02:48.169 --> 02:50.173
-No! Tamar!
-[baby crying]

02:50.257 --> 02:52.302
No! Please!

02:52.386 --> 02:55.183
-[grunts]
-AWOL: Your ass scared now, ain't you?

02:55.267 --> 02:57.271
[baby, Tamar crying]

02:59.734 --> 03:01.362
-TAMAR: Livvie! Help us!
-Oh...

03:01.445 --> 03:02.699
[phone beeps, video stops]

03:09.128 --> 03:11.257
[whimpers]

03:11.340 --> 03:15.516
[Old Lace roaring, screeching]

03:15.600 --> 03:17.144
KAROLINA:
She doesn't sound good.

03:17.227 --> 03:20.025
-Hey, it's OK.
-It hurts. It hurts.

03:20.108 --> 03:22.906
Where the hell are Nico and Wilder?!

03:22.989 --> 03:25.620
Got every stomach medicine they had.
Something's gotta help.

03:25.703 --> 03:27.874
NICO:
And if it doesn't, I've got this.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.878
Whoa. What is this?

03:29.961 --> 03:31.255
A Wiccan charm bag.

03:31.339 --> 03:33.886
Just put it under her pillow.
It'll encourage good health.

03:33.969 --> 03:35.598
It's pungent but powerful.

03:35.681 --> 03:38.269
You do realize we're trying
to make her less sick, right?

03:38.353 --> 03:40.315
-[groans]
-Do something!

03:40.398 --> 03:42.277
I don't know what to do!
And Old Lace is not helping!

03:42.361 --> 03:44.281
-Guys, calm down.
-We're all worried about them, OK?

03:44.365 --> 03:45.701
But let's not turn on each other.

03:45.785 --> 03:47.914
I'm sorry. I'm just scared.

03:47.997 --> 03:49.375
MOLLY:
Maybe Old Lace is hungry.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.087
She hasn't eaten anything
since she's gotten sick.

03:52.005 --> 03:53.801
I'm so cold.

03:55.220 --> 03:56.389
I don't get it.

03:56.472 --> 03:59.186
She says she's freezing,
but she doesn't have a temperature.

04:00.898 --> 04:03.236
What the hell is this?

04:03.319 --> 04:04.698
We need to get them help.
Take them somewhere.

04:04.781 --> 04:08.539
Where? The hospital? The zoo? I mean,
we don't have a lot of viable options.

04:08.622 --> 04:09.999
Old Lace is awfully quiet.

04:14.133 --> 04:16.637
[wheezing]

04:16.721 --> 04:18.349
Guys, we have to do something, fast.

04:27.451 --> 04:29.038
CHASE:
Anything?

04:29.121 --> 04:33.296
Well, according to WizMD, she's either
got mercury poisoning or Parrot Fever.

04:33.379 --> 04:35.885
Which I'm pretty sure only affects birds,
so probably not that?

04:35.968 --> 04:37.137
CHASE:
No, though maybe that.

04:37.220 --> 04:39.893
Because theropods have a lot
of bird-like characteristics.

04:39.976 --> 04:42.355
Gert and I have been
debating this for a while.

04:42.439 --> 04:44.234
[sighs]

04:44.318 --> 04:46.656
-Look, Chase, it's gonna be OK.
-CHASE: Is it?

04:46.740 --> 04:49.746
Because the most important person
in the world to me is in pain and...

04:50.873 --> 04:53.461
Look, I wouldn't be saying this
unless I was desperate,

04:53.545 --> 04:56.383
but you're the smartest one here.
I need your help.

04:57.219 --> 04:59.139
I get it. I'll keep searching.

04:59.223 --> 05:00.851
Thanks. Seriously.

05:03.899 --> 05:07.532
If it helps...I know how it feels.

05:08.366 --> 05:10.621
Thinking that
you're doing the right thing,

05:10.704 --> 05:12.082
and royally screwing up.

05:12.165 --> 05:15.881
I appreciate your empathy, but that shit
you pulled with AWOL was really not cool.

05:18.094 --> 05:20.265
I just wanted to make our parents pay.

05:21.058 --> 05:23.396
Instead, I made a deal
with the wrong guy,

05:23.479 --> 05:26.443
I ended up losing a girl
that I really liked...

05:26.528 --> 05:28.615
and pissed everybody off.

05:28.699 --> 05:29.784
Again.

05:30.661 --> 05:33.834
I want to look like I know
what I'm doing out here,

05:33.917 --> 05:35.378
but I don't.

05:35.461 --> 05:37.550
Me neither. It sucks.

05:40.305 --> 05:42.602
At least you get
to blow stuff up sometimes.

05:42.685 --> 05:45.023
Yeah, I do like that part.

05:45.983 --> 05:47.485
[alarm blares]

05:47.570 --> 05:50.200
-What is that?
-Motion sensors!

05:50.283 --> 05:53.707
I set up some WizCams around
the hostel for security. What tripped it?

05:53.790 --> 05:56.003
Maybe Molly went outside
to find Old Lace some leaves?

05:56.086 --> 05:57.590
Molly's right here.

05:57.673 --> 05:58.675
[beeps]

06:00.261 --> 06:01.430
NICO:
Who's that?

06:03.560 --> 06:05.773
-What do we do? They're gonna find us.
-Not if they can't see us.

06:12.369 --> 06:13.538
Camouflage!

06:21.136 --> 06:23.892
Oh, shit. It's AWOL.
How'd he find us?

06:27.482 --> 06:29.737
-Livvie gave us up.
-No...

06:33.578 --> 06:35.833
Well? Where is it?

06:35.916 --> 06:37.335
It was right there.

06:39.006 --> 06:40.676
You think this is a game?

06:40.759 --> 06:43.055
You keep playing with me,
how you think this is gonna end?

06:43.139 --> 06:45.811
Look, please. I swear it was right here!
This is the spot!

06:45.894 --> 06:47.648
I wouldn't bring you out here
just to kill me!

06:47.732 --> 06:50.529
AWOL. Over here.

06:59.296 --> 07:02.553
[sighs] Great. You didn't want
to hide the cameras a little better?

07:03.930 --> 07:06.101
KAROLINA: If they know we're in here,
why aren't they trying to get in?

07:06.185 --> 07:08.189
ALEX: They can't see the entrance
with Nico's spell up.

07:08.272 --> 07:09.399
They don't want to come in blind.

07:09.483 --> 07:11.028
It's safer for them
to try to get us to come out.

07:11.111 --> 07:13.700
You had to provoke him.
You had to bring Livvie back here.

07:13.784 --> 07:15.788
She wouldn't be doing this
if those guys weren't forcing her.

07:15.871 --> 07:18.585
Or maybe she did it as payback--
since Alex betrayed her.

07:18.668 --> 07:21.381
Look, you can hate me all you want,
but Livvie didn't do anything wrong.

07:21.465 --> 07:23.720
She's only mixed up with AWOL
because of our parents!

07:23.804 --> 07:25.891
-We have to get her out of there!
-CHASE: How?

07:25.974 --> 07:28.980
We're trapped down here with no phones
and no one to call even if we had 'em.

07:29.064 --> 07:32.863
Gert and Old Lace, they're sick.
I mean, we're on our own here.

07:32.947 --> 07:35.451
How do we save Livvie
if we can't even save ourselves?

07:45.597 --> 07:47.643
[theme music playing]

08:56.717 --> 08:59.662
Thank you very much for coming.
Journey into brightness.

08:59.745 --> 09:00.998
Thank you.

09:01.081 --> 09:02.375
WOMAN:
Frank.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.753
Great to see you. As always.

09:03.837 --> 09:05.089
-Beautiful.
-Thank you.

09:07.511 --> 09:09.724
Vaughn, have you seen my wife today?

09:11.519 --> 09:15.192
I have. She said not
to say anything to anyone.

09:15.276 --> 09:17.238
I'm pretty sure she didn't mean me.

09:17.322 --> 09:19.284
She specifically said you.

09:19.367 --> 09:20.579
FRANK:
Vaughn, where is she?

09:22.750 --> 09:24.377
She's out back by the dumpsters.

09:38.782 --> 09:41.036
FRANK:
This is a strange sight.

09:41.119 --> 09:43.457
Even at home,
taking out the trash is my job.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.591
Seemed fitting that I be the one
to dismantle this place.

09:47.675 --> 09:48.927
Brick by brick.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.895
Leslie. These are some
of our most sacred texts!

09:53.978 --> 09:56.984
And your father's dream journal?
How can you be so callous?

09:57.068 --> 09:58.237
If you don't want this stuff, then I do.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.324
After everything
that I've done for this place?

10:01.243 --> 10:03.957
I have killed. I've sacrificed.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.461
Are you really trying to compare
your sacrifices to mine?

10:06.546 --> 10:09.342
Look, that chapter is done.

10:09.426 --> 10:12.891
With Jonah gone, this church can finally
be what it was always meant to be.

10:12.975 --> 10:14.060
It can save lives.

10:14.144 --> 10:17.191
I can't be a part of something
I don't believe in.

10:17.275 --> 10:20.239
It's time to set it all on fire
and start over.

10:20.322 --> 10:22.619
But you have a responsibility.

10:22.703 --> 10:25.751
"I am but an empty vessel
for the light.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.631
No longer an individual
but connected to a greater purpose."

10:30.009 --> 10:34.434
See? You have my father's writings
memorized. You don't even need these.

10:34.518 --> 10:36.856
You're only taking this away from me
because you know I need it!

10:40.404 --> 10:43.035
LESLIE:
You told me...

10:43.118 --> 10:45.624
that all you needed
was for us to be a family again.

10:48.045 --> 10:51.803
Did you really mean it?
Because I believed you.

10:53.096 --> 10:54.767
And I want that too.

10:56.646 --> 10:58.273
Of course I meant it.

11:00.486 --> 11:02.198
Then I need you to choose.

11:03.701 --> 11:08.168
Us...or the Church.
Can't have both.

11:25.829 --> 11:27.164
MITCH:
It's our move.

11:29.085 --> 11:30.839
Let's get a conversation goin'.

11:34.722 --> 11:36.934
[Livvie cries out]

11:39.523 --> 11:41.276
I'm so sorry.

11:41.359 --> 11:43.573
They made me. But Alex,
you're gonna have to come out

11:43.656 --> 11:44.992
or they're gonna kill me and my family.

11:45.075 --> 11:48.498
You better hope he cares about you
as much as you think he does.

11:51.714 --> 11:53.300
I know you're in there!

11:55.513 --> 11:58.268
You wanted to talk earlier.
Why you so quiet now?

11:58.561 --> 11:59.980
His fight's with me. I can handle him.

12:00.064 --> 12:01.483
Oh, like you handled him before?

12:01.567 --> 12:03.278
Didn't we just have a heart-to-heart
of the fact

12:03.362 --> 12:04.615
that you don't know
what you're doing?!

12:04.698 --> 12:07.579
If you go out there, he'll kill you
and then come in anyway. Just stay put.

12:07.663 --> 12:10.376
I thought you was a gangster, Alex.

12:10.459 --> 12:12.673
You just gonna let your girl die?

12:12.756 --> 12:16.262
'Cause that's what's gonna happen
if you don't do what I say.

12:16.346 --> 12:18.893
Bring me that footage
and come out quietly.

12:18.977 --> 12:20.689
-I have to go out there!
-KAROLINA: Alex--

12:20.772 --> 12:22.651
I'm not gonna let him hurt her!

12:23.318 --> 12:24.404
I'm sorry, Alex.

12:28.328 --> 12:30.040
-Jesus, Molly!
-Really sorry,

12:30.124 --> 12:31.919
but you're not going anywhere.

12:32.003 --> 12:34.090
It just feels like
we're taking a big chance.

12:34.173 --> 12:36.219
Using a brain scrambler
on one of our kids?

12:36.302 --> 12:38.766
It's not a brain scrambler, Janet.

12:38.850 --> 12:41.647
It simply emits a high-power soundwave

12:41.731 --> 12:44.570
that disorients and incapacitates
its target.

12:44.653 --> 12:46.574
It's very safe.

12:46.657 --> 12:49.872
I mean, I understand that we have to keep
Nico from being able to think of a spell,

12:49.955 --> 12:51.876
but this could cause
permanent brain damage.

12:51.959 --> 12:54.631
I can't believe that Tina and Robert
are OK with it.

12:54.715 --> 12:57.428
No, I believe that Tina
is OK with it, but...

13:00.309 --> 13:03.023
-What?
-Did you always talk this much?

13:04.400 --> 13:07.073
Well, excuse me if I'm concerned
about the safety of our children.

13:07.156 --> 13:09.202
VICTOR:
Oh, I don't mean to offend.

13:09.285 --> 13:12.834
And I...hope you understand

13:12.918 --> 13:16.007
how instrumental
you've been to this process.

13:16.091 --> 13:20.683
But if we want to bring the kids home,
we have to get these done.

13:21.602 --> 13:22.687
All right?

13:25.568 --> 13:26.821
[gasps]

13:26.904 --> 13:30.244
Ohh. I'm so sorry.
I'll get this all cleaned up.

13:30.327 --> 13:33.041
-VICTOR: Janet, you don't have to do that.
-Well...

13:34.628 --> 13:36.005
VICTOR:
It's all right.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.600
Look.

13:42.811 --> 13:43.980
[beeps]

13:44.063 --> 13:45.984
[clattering]

13:46.067 --> 13:50.785
If we're going to get these
weapons done and get the kids back,

13:50.869 --> 13:52.914
I need you.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.462
On my side,
and at the top of your game.

13:57.423 --> 14:01.222
Your stress...isn't going
to help anything.

14:03.811 --> 14:05.188
So relax.

14:06.190 --> 14:07.736
OK.

14:13.413 --> 14:14.498
[Janet yelps]

14:16.545 --> 14:17.964
[grunts]

14:18.048 --> 14:19.133
-VICTOR: It's leather.
-JANET: Wiggle.

14:19.216 --> 14:21.012
-VICTOR: All right.
-[grunts]

14:21.095 --> 14:24.060
I, uh... haven't, um...

14:24.143 --> 14:25.187
done this for a while.

14:25.270 --> 14:27.901
I know.
I've missed you, too, Victor.

14:30.949 --> 14:33.161
This is ridiculous! You guys
are gonna get Livvie killed!

14:33.244 --> 14:35.165
I'm sorry, Alex.
But we have to stick together.

14:35.248 --> 14:37.587
And we have to be smart. Negotiate.

14:37.671 --> 14:39.173
If he's working with our parents,

14:39.256 --> 14:41.219
then he's not going to really want
to hurt any of us.

14:41.302 --> 14:42.429
You think he's bluffing?

14:42.514 --> 14:45.435
No, he's not!
You saw what he did in Compton.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.189
He didn't seem to have a problem
killing us back then.

14:47.272 --> 14:49.443
You don't get a vote here, Alex.
All right?

14:49.528 --> 14:50.738
You've already shown
that you're not capable

14:50.822 --> 14:52.366
of making a good decision
for the group.

14:52.449 --> 14:53.911
Please just do something! OK?

14:53.995 --> 14:57.042
This is a big spell and I don't know
how much longer I can focus on it!

14:57.126 --> 14:59.255
I've never held a spell
for this long before!

14:59.338 --> 15:01.092
-CHASE: All right, let's do this.
-Wait!

15:01.552 --> 15:02.804
CHASE:
What now?

15:02.887 --> 15:04.390
ALEX:
If you talk to him through the front door,

15:04.473 --> 15:05.852
he'll know where the entrance is.

15:05.935 --> 15:08.273
My security system's got an intercom.
Use it.

15:12.782 --> 15:14.118
CHASE:
We want to negotiate.

15:14.201 --> 15:16.247
It'd be easier if we could
look each other in the eye.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.376
Not gonna happen.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.673
And you can't see this,
but I'm pointing a weapon directly at you,

15:20.757 --> 15:23.011
-so don't try anything.
-Huh.

15:23.094 --> 15:26.100
-I'm not sure that I buy that.
-Take one step closer and find out.

15:29.983 --> 15:31.152
Oh.

15:33.908 --> 15:36.789
All right.
So what are you gon' give me?

15:36.872 --> 15:39.795
If you're working for our parents,
why haven't you called them here yet?

15:39.878 --> 15:41.047
Or Flores?

15:41.130 --> 15:44.554
Flores is out of the picture.
I'm in charge now.

15:44.638 --> 15:47.852
And I can handle this
without your parents' input.

15:47.936 --> 15:50.858
First things first. Get that gun
off of Livvie, and stop hurting her.

15:54.574 --> 15:55.910
I'm so sorry.

15:55.993 --> 15:57.705
They made me.

15:57.789 --> 15:59.458
KAROLINA: It's okay, Livvie.
We're going to get you out of this.

15:59.543 --> 16:03.091
All right. Here's our offer.
We'll give you all the footage Alex has.

16:03.174 --> 16:06.682
-ALEX: No! Chase, you can't--
-But you got to give us Livvie.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.894
AWOL: You haven't done
much negotiating before, have you?

16:08.978 --> 16:12.317
CHASE: You can't see through this shield.
And we're not coming out.

16:12.401 --> 16:15.031
So are you gonna make
a counter-offer or what?

16:15.115 --> 16:17.745
AWOL: That's a pretty impressive
little trick there.

16:17.829 --> 16:21.210
Reminds me of
when the goth girl with the magic wand

16:21.294 --> 16:24.091
froze our faces back in Compton.

16:24.175 --> 16:26.429
But here's my counter-offer.

16:26.513 --> 16:28.308
I'll take that footage,

16:28.391 --> 16:31.773
as long as the witch
brings it out to me.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.234
KAROLINA: What do we do?
We can't send Nico out there.

16:33.318 --> 16:34.946
He just wants to get the shield down
so he can come in.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.449
CHASE: But if we don't do it,
he's gonna kill Livvie.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.369
No, he won't.

16:39.831 --> 16:42.545
Think about it.
She's all the leverage he's got.

16:42.629 --> 16:44.674
If he kills her, he's got nothing.

16:44.758 --> 16:46.553
MOLLY: You really wanna
take that chance? I mean,

16:46.637 --> 16:48.974
you were willing to risk your life
for her just a minute ago.

16:49.058 --> 16:51.395
I know. I was being irrational.

16:51.479 --> 16:55.780
But I swear, if you guys listen to me,

16:55.863 --> 16:58.117
I can get us out of this--
all of us.

16:58.201 --> 17:01.290
AWOL:
Hello! I'm waiting.

17:01.374 --> 17:05.048
Boo hoo. You're going to keep waiting,
'cause you're on our timetable, pal!

17:05.131 --> 17:07.176
Oh. Am I?

17:08.471 --> 17:11.811
-[Taser crackling]
-[Livvie screaming]

17:11.895 --> 17:14.651
Come on, let 'em see you.
Let 'em see you.

17:14.733 --> 17:15.861
There it is.

17:15.944 --> 17:18.701
Y'all thought I was playin'
when I said I'd kill her?

17:18.784 --> 17:19.994
-[Livvie moaning]
-Look,

17:20.078 --> 17:22.082
and I don't need to do it quickly.

17:22.165 --> 17:25.130
In fact, I prefer to do it slowly.

17:25.213 --> 17:28.595
Pull her apart piece by piece.

17:28.679 --> 17:31.852
All right! We'll give you the footage!
Just give us time to get the computer!

17:31.935 --> 17:33.689
ALEX: We can't give him Nico
or the footage.

17:33.772 --> 17:35.317
We gotta get Livvie away from them,

17:35.400 --> 17:36.695
and we got to get help for Gert
and Old Lace.

17:36.778 --> 17:39.325
Listing our problems
isn't exactly solving them, Wilder.

17:39.408 --> 17:40.870
Just do what he says, Chase!

17:40.953 --> 17:42.414
And do it fast
so I can let the spell down!

17:42.497 --> 17:46.213
AWOL is holding all the cards
right now. He has a hostage.

17:46.297 --> 17:48.552
What we need is a hostage of our own.

17:54.898 --> 17:58.656
OK. I know you feel terrible,
but we gotta move.

17:58.739 --> 18:00.492
Alex has got a plan.

18:00.576 --> 18:03.624
Given his unsteady leadership of late,
not sure it's a good one,

18:03.707 --> 18:05.836
but we got no choice.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.844
And as Coach Alphona always says,
"pain heals, but glory lasts forever."

18:09.928 --> 18:11.180
So come on!

18:11.263 --> 18:13.393
Come on, it's game time, baby!
Let's go!

18:13.476 --> 18:16.023
[Gert groaning]

18:16.107 --> 18:17.527
Gert, please.

18:19.071 --> 18:20.448
Hey! Nico can't hold
that spell forever.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.578
As soon as it drops,
those psychos are coming in.

18:22.662 --> 18:24.624
Inspirational speech didn't work.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.419
[Gert softly groans]

18:26.503 --> 18:29.676
Who should I carry first,
Gert or the dinosaur?

18:29.759 --> 18:31.722
[wheezing]

18:34.728 --> 18:37.274
NICO:
Guys, hurry! You have to go!

18:37.357 --> 18:38.777
Dealer's choice.

18:40.573 --> 18:41.742
OK.

18:42.577 --> 18:43.996
Come on, Gert.

18:51.762 --> 18:53.599
[soft clanking]

18:53.682 --> 18:54.768
VICTOR:
Janet?

18:57.314 --> 18:58.776
Janet?

19:01.405 --> 19:03.034
What happened in here?

19:03.827 --> 19:07.209
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean? Look at this place!

19:07.292 --> 19:09.881
Why are you staring at me
like I'm crazy?

19:09.964 --> 19:11.551
Do you not remember?

19:12.637 --> 19:14.516
[grunts] Remember what?

19:19.567 --> 19:21.028
Victor, we made love
an hour ago in here.

19:21.111 --> 19:22.907
Are you saying that
you don't remember that?

19:22.990 --> 19:27.290
Janet, that's ridiculous. You know
how important a clean lab is to me.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.088
And it's two o'clock on a Wednesday.

19:32.425 --> 19:33.720
What's gotten into you?

19:38.354 --> 19:39.774
What do you remember?

19:41.987 --> 19:43.615
[scoffs]

19:43.699 --> 19:46.120
I woke up, and then I came in here,

19:46.203 --> 19:48.207
and the lab was wrecked.

19:54.011 --> 19:55.681
You've been through so much.

19:55.764 --> 19:59.522
And Jonah was in your head
for a long time.

19:59.606 --> 20:01.818
Who knows what damage that caused.

20:04.616 --> 20:08.582
I think...that maybe
you need to see someone.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.502
I think I need to lie down.

20:16.932 --> 20:19.019
You'll deal with Tina
when she gets here, right?

20:22.359 --> 20:23.528
Of course.

20:28.037 --> 20:29.749
[beeping]

20:33.130 --> 20:35.844
-Aura and Frances for you, Mrs. Dean.
-Thank you, Vaughn.

20:39.811 --> 20:41.397
Sorry to interrupt your day.
I know you're busy

20:41.480 --> 20:43.860
with the Runaways Program,
but there are some things--

20:43.944 --> 20:46.365
-We know why you called us.
-LESLIE: You do?

20:46.448 --> 20:47.702
FRANCES:
Frank filled us in.

20:47.785 --> 20:49.956
AURA:
We're happy that you turned to us

20:50.039 --> 20:53.004
-in your time of confusion.
-My what?

20:53.588 --> 20:55.466
AURA:
Leslie...

20:55.551 --> 20:58.765
I've known you
since the day you were born.

20:58.849 --> 21:02.230
I was an Esteemed Witness
at your Corruscation Ceremony.

21:02.313 --> 21:04.234
I crocheted your tunic.

21:04.317 --> 21:07.323
We know how difficult it's been for you
since we lost Karolina.

21:07.407 --> 21:10.079
But this church is a family.

21:10.163 --> 21:12.918
And the only thing that matters
is keeping that family...

21:13.002 --> 21:14.337
-Intact.
-Intact.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.636
[scoffs]

21:19.473 --> 21:22.145
This church is not a family.

21:23.481 --> 21:25.068
It's a scam.

21:25.151 --> 21:29.869
Built on my father's bad poetry
and the gullibility of desperate people.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.921
Which is why I'm shutting it down,
starting with the Runaways Program.

21:35.004 --> 21:38.094
-We'd like to speak with Jonah.
-Jonah is gone and my decision is final.

21:38.177 --> 21:41.643
-Who the hell do you think you are?!
-Do not forget who you are speaking to.

21:41.726 --> 21:43.814
Oh, yes. Little Leslie.

21:43.897 --> 21:45.734
Still playing leader.

21:45.818 --> 21:48.782
Still thinking she can do
whatever she wants.

21:49.659 --> 21:52.122
Well you can't. We won't let you.

21:52.205 --> 21:54.669
You have no choice in the matter.

21:54.752 --> 21:57.215
The Church is its people, Leslie.

21:58.384 --> 21:59.887
Not its leadership.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.406
[scoffs]

22:16.044 --> 22:17.590
Hey! They're making a break for it!

22:17.673 --> 22:18.884
-Mount up! Mount up!
-[cop shouting]

22:20.219 --> 22:23.475
-ALEX [distant] You wanted to see me?
-Halt!

22:24.812 --> 22:26.691
ALEX:
I got your footage right here!

22:26.774 --> 22:30.824
So you let your friends go,
but you stayed to save your girl, huh?

22:32.160 --> 22:34.957
How honorable.
And stupid.

22:35.041 --> 22:38.297
ALEX: This is between you and me.
All right, they got nothin' to do with it.

22:38.380 --> 22:40.176
I'll go to my parents without a fight.

22:41.220 --> 22:43.808
You think that you're in charge here.

22:43.892 --> 22:47.566
That you've got any say
on how this is going to end.

22:49.194 --> 22:53.452
Well, I hate to disappoint you,
but I decide that.

22:53.536 --> 22:55.540
ALEX:
Guess I didn't think this through.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.254
Strap me up!

23:03.515 --> 23:04.642
Jay! My go bag!

23:05.978 --> 23:07.523
Stay with her!

23:20.757 --> 23:23.053
Or maybe you didn't think it through.

23:23.137 --> 23:24.139
Fortress!

23:26.310 --> 23:28.188
[AWOL screaming]

23:31.863 --> 23:33.032
[cries out]

23:48.955 --> 23:50.609
[tires squealing]

23:53.197 --> 23:54.950
[horn honks]

23:56.078 --> 23:57.163
I think I lost 'em!

23:57.246 --> 23:59.877
They were on foot and I did
almost hit like 12 trees,

23:59.960 --> 24:02.090
but incredible driving on my part,
I think!

24:04.386 --> 24:06.974
-If only I knew where I was driving to.
-[Gert groans]

24:07.851 --> 24:09.730
[Old Lace wheezing]

24:10.732 --> 24:12.110
CHASE:
It's OK.

24:12.193 --> 24:13.822
[kisses] I got this.

24:14.657 --> 24:16.702
[guns engine]

24:19.332 --> 24:21.546
Don't you just love metal?

24:21.629 --> 24:25.469
It's so...unyielding.

24:25.554 --> 24:27.390
S-So cold.

24:28.643 --> 24:30.856
It doesn't give a shit about anybody.

24:31.858 --> 24:33.485
Yeah. It's great.

24:34.905 --> 24:37.703
I'm sorry Victor's not here.
He's resting.

24:40.291 --> 24:43.046
-I thought we were on a tight timeline.
-JANET: We are.

24:43.130 --> 24:45.510
Just, ever since he came out
of that healing algorithm,

24:45.594 --> 24:47.430
he's been acting strange.

24:47.514 --> 24:49.810
He keeps blacking out, losing time.

24:49.894 --> 24:53.860
Maybe this is all too much for him.
He's been working here non-stop.

24:53.943 --> 24:56.072

24:56.156 --> 24:57.408
No wonder he's exhausted.

24:57.492 --> 25:00.080
JANET: Okay, you know what?
It's not funny.

25:00.164 --> 25:02.628
-I'm very worried about him.
-Oh.

25:02.711 --> 25:04.088
You seem tense, Janet.

25:04.172 --> 25:06.928
Well, of course I'm tense, Tina.
I'm alone in a room with you.

25:08.055 --> 25:10.434
What is this,
some kind of payback for Robert and me?

25:10.519 --> 25:13.273
Robert and...

25:13.357 --> 25:14.568
you?

25:16.363 --> 25:19.452
I don't understand why you're
so comfortable with all of this.

25:19.537 --> 25:22.751
You realize that that thing is gonna
be used on your daughter, right?

25:22.834 --> 25:24.462
I thought you wanted to get
the children back?

25:24.547 --> 25:26.926
I do, but I guess I'm just
a little bit concerned

25:27.009 --> 25:30.850
about how eager you and Victor are
to use scary alien weapons on them.

25:30.934 --> 25:33.021
They're not scary
if you know how to use them.

25:38.575 --> 25:41.329
-Has Victor shown you how?
-No.

25:46.716 --> 25:48.970

Feel the weight.

25:52.101 --> 25:56.026
-Just take a deep breath.
-[Janet inhales, exhales]

25:56.652 --> 25:59.240
-Release the tension.
-OK. Tina, I--

25:59.324 --> 26:03.123
You're not like metal at all, are you?

26:06.171 --> 26:08.258
It's no wonder Victor and Robert
couldn't resist--

26:08.342 --> 26:10.262
All right, you know what?
I don't need this!

26:10.346 --> 26:12.517
I'm under enough stress
without you messing with me.

26:13.561 --> 26:15.105

Janet? What's--?

26:23.080 --> 26:24.290

on human flesh at close range.

Drop the act. I know who you are.
I've seen where you come from.

27:04.621 --> 27:05.790
You don't know anything about me.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.506
I know that my men got you surrounded.

27:10.508 --> 27:12.554
I know they have something that you don't.

27:12.637 --> 27:14.474
An actual intent to kill.

27:14.558 --> 27:15.935
We'll do whatever we have to.

away from your mansions

What the hell have you got?

27:34.973 --> 27:36.184
I said shut up!

You know, what I'm gonna do
to y'all is nothin'

to your little bitch outside.

27:47.456 --> 27:49.753
And I know something about you.

I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.

Stay with Nico.

28:24.906 --> 28:28.581
What the hell was that back there?
Were you actually going t-to kill him?

28:28.664 --> 28:32.756
I don't know what came over me.
OK? I just couldn't see straight.

28:33.340 --> 28:36.597
I just kept thinking about what
he's doing to Livvie, and I lost it.

28:36.680 --> 28:39.393
Well, do me a favor and find it,
because you and I have to figure this out.

28:39.477 --> 28:42.525
There's nothing to figure out.
Only one side is making it out of this.

28:42.609 --> 28:45.197
What is wrong with you?
AWOL was right about one thing.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.244
-We are just kids. We're not killers.
-But they are.

28:48.328 --> 28:49.748
And if we want to make it out of here,

28:49.831 --> 28:52.086
we might have to make a decision
there's no coming back from.

28:53.923 --> 28:55.635
There has to be another way.

28:55.718 --> 28:58.056
I cannot use my powers
to take someone's life.

28:58.139 --> 29:00.687
If Nico hadn't killed Jonah
he would have taken you,

29:00.770 --> 29:02.607
and who knows what would have happened.

29:02.691 --> 29:04.485
We have to face it.

29:04.569 --> 29:06.657
If we want to survive and stay together,

29:06.740 --> 29:08.994
we can't come out of every situation
with clean hands.

29:12.961 --> 29:14.798
I just need some time to think.

[Nico grunting, groaning]

29:19.850 --> 29:21.436
You know,

29:21.520 --> 29:24.818
I had girls like you
back at my high school.

29:24.901 --> 29:27.448
-I know why you dress that way.
-[Nico crying out]

Look, you don't need to be doing this.
I can see how much it hurts you.

29:34.044 --> 29:37.426
Just let the shield down,
and you gonna be all right.

29:37.510 --> 29:40.474
Ain't nothing gonna happen to you.
You could just walk away.

29:41.309 --> 29:44.273
MOLLY: Alex and Karolina are coming up
with something. Just focus on it, Nico!

29:44.356 --> 29:46.110
-You've got this!
-I am focusing!

29:46.194 --> 29:48.072
You can't hold it anymore.

You're not strong enough.

29:50.285 --> 29:51.538
[Nico moans]

29:56.005 --> 29:58.176
I'm too weak from the last spell.
I can't hold onto it!

MOLLY:
You're not weak.

29:59.513 --> 30:01.015
You're the strongest person I know.

30:01.098 --> 30:03.646
You're the reason why
we've made it this far, Nico.

30:03.729 --> 30:05.482
I believe in you. You've got this.

30:05.566 --> 30:07.779
You don't understand.
There's something wrong with me.

30:07.862 --> 30:11.077
I killed Jonah,
and I didn't even think about it.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.791
Because the Staff told me
that it was right.

30:13.874 --> 30:16.922
I could feel it clawing at me.

31:32.615 --> 31:34.661
Can you think
of what she ate yesterday?

31:35.955 --> 31:38.711
Well, we have been eating
a lot of literal garbage.

31:38.794 --> 31:41.132
But I mean, we all ate the same stuff
and no one else got sick.

It's OK. Just breathe.

31:47.102 --> 31:48.981
OK. Thank you, Chase.

31:49.064 --> 31:52.070
For bringing her here
and taking good care of her.

31:52.154 --> 31:54.951
-I just need you to make her better.
-DALE: We will.

31:55.035 --> 31:57.247
As soon as we figure out
what exactly is wrong with her.

31:57.330 --> 31:58.667
Go ahead and roll up her sleeve.

-The antidote.

32:02.382 --> 32:04.261
The antidote to what?

32:05.221 --> 32:07.602
Look, you said you would do anything
you could to bring her home.

32:07.685 --> 32:10.482
Wait. You did this to our daughter?

32:10.566 --> 32:13.071
When? Stacey, how?

32:14.991 --> 32:16.870
This was what you were working on
down here, isn't it?

32:16.953 --> 32:18.665
No wonder you didn't want me to see it.

32:18.749 --> 32:21.128
Wait, what the hell is wrong with you?

32:21.212 --> 32:23.424
This is none of your business.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.097
And of course I didn't set out
to make Gert sick.

32:26.180 --> 32:28.309
I sent a drone
between La Brea and the 5

32:28.392 --> 32:31.023
that contained an agent poisonous
to the Deinonychus.

32:31.107 --> 32:32.192
[Old Lace snorts]

32:32.275 --> 32:34.823
It should not have had any effect
on Gert's anatomy at all.

32:34.906 --> 32:38.539
And you didn't think that germ warfare
was just a little bit extreme?

32:38.622 --> 32:40.291
-It worked, didn't it?
-DALE: Did it?

32:40.375 --> 32:43.674
Stacey, look at her.
Look at what you've done.

32:43.757 --> 32:47.013
Can you honestly tell me
that bringing her home was worth this?

32:47.097 --> 32:48.600
Can you?!

32:48.684 --> 32:50.270
I understand that you're upset.

32:50.353 --> 32:52.440

to describe it.

How could you, Stacey?

32:53.944 --> 32:56.115
This isn't you. This isn't us.

32:56.783 --> 32:58.620
I can fix this.

32:58.704 --> 33:03.337
Unfortunately, I only have enough
to heal Gert, and not the dinosaur.

biology or poisons or dinosaurs.

But I do know that that dinosaur has
a crazy telepathic connection with Gert.

33:19.787 --> 33:22.627
Yeah, she can give her orders.
What is your point?

33:22.710 --> 33:24.379
Old Lace got sick before Gert.

33:24.463 --> 33:27.385
Every time we tried to get Old Lace
to eat, Gert would get nauseous.

33:27.469 --> 33:31.143
Old Lace would get a temperature,
but Gert kept saying she was freezing.

33:31.227 --> 33:33.064
Doesn't it stand to reason
that Old Lace is sick

33:33.147 --> 33:34.776
and Gert's symptoms are psychosomatic?

33:34.859 --> 33:36.863
So you're saying that
they're so intertwined

33:36.947 --> 33:39.409
that Gert can feel
what Old Lace feels?

33:39.493 --> 33:41.915
-That's incredible.
-That's impossible, is what that is.

Listen to me! I'm telling you
if we want to save Gert--

33:44.169 --> 33:46.340
Then we need to give
Old Lace the antidote.
