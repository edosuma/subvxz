that nutsack don't have.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.257
A camera.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.967
There's a mini-ass camera
in these.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.344
Remember Rob Portman?

05:03.552 --> 05:04.512
He's the one
that told me about 'em.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.347
Likes to use 'em
when he's...

05:08.641 --> 05:09.850
Whoa.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.311
Yeah, guy's a creep,
but maybe a genius.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.522
He's not gonna
let you wear those.

05:14.730 --> 05:16.357
Why not?

05:16.565 --> 05:18.484
With the whole excessive police
force blowing up in the news,

05:18.692 --> 05:19.902
all the cities
got paranoid

05:20.110 --> 05:21.946
and installed those cameras
in the cruisers.

05:22.154 --> 05:24.573
- What's one more?
- Why do we need to film this?

05:24.782 --> 05:26.492
To expose
the seedy underbelly

05:26.700 --> 05:28.702
of the corrupt
criminal justice system,

05:28.911 --> 05:31.121
which is supporting
the ulterior motives

05:31.330 --> 05:32.623
of the municipal government,

05:32.832 --> 05:35.376
which caters to
the oligarchs in Washington,

05:35.584 --> 05:37.294
which are just foot soldiers
to the Illuminati,

05:37.503 --> 05:39.171
which have been sent here
by the demonic forces...

05:39.380 --> 05:41.924
I swear if you mention
Illuminati, conspiracies,

05:42.132 --> 05:45.219
or any of your paranoid bullshit
one more time, I'm outta here.

05:45.427 --> 05:46.804
I've listened to it since high
school, and I'm done with it.

05:47.012 --> 05:48.931
You need to grow up.

05:49.139 --> 05:50.933
You know, if you would have applied
yourself to your academics

05:51.141 --> 05:52.268
the way that
you do to these theories,

05:52.476 --> 05:53.644
you could have
actually gone somewhere.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.772
- Like Fordham?
- Yes, like Fordham.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.274
You know, it's actually one
of the top institutions

05:58.482 --> 06:00.442
in the country
academically speaking.

06:00.651 --> 06:04.405
You sure the Illuminati didn't recruit
you while you were at Fordham?

06:04.613 --> 06:07.533
They like to troll those gothic
institutions, like, whoa.

06:07.741 --> 06:10.661
- You have to be the biggest...
- Boom!

06:10.870 --> 06:12.538
- Let's do this!
- Shh, shh, shh, shh!

06:12.746 --> 06:15.583
Ahh, nice glasses, Elton!

06:15.791 --> 06:16.917
Look at this guy!

06:17.126 --> 06:19.962

- Whatever.

06:20.170 --> 06:21.422

- Whatever.

06:21.630 --> 06:24.049
Ahh.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.552
Hey, buckle up!
It's the law!

06:26.760 --> 06:27.970
I'm just kidding.

06:28.178 --> 06:29.722
Well, maybe
you two Nancies should.

06:29.930 --> 06:33.142
What are you guys, like,
butt buddies or something?

06:33.350 --> 06:34.560
I'm just kidding.

06:34.768 --> 06:36.103
If you guys are gay
for each other,

06:36.312 --> 06:37.521
that's totally fine
with me, man.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.939
And it's, like, legal now.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.067
<i>Like, for real.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.987

06:45.195 --> 06:46.864
<i>We have a 10-54 in progress

06:47.072 --> 06:48.449
<i>What's your 20?</i>

06:48.657 --> 06:50.451
<i>Dispatch,
I'm clear on that traffic.</i>

06:50.659 --> 06:53.412
<i>10-9, Car 86,

Um... I'm at the corner
of Main and 20th about...

06:57.625 --> 07:00.753
- No, we're actually.
- Shh! Shut your damn mouth!

07:03.464 --> 07:05.883
Uh... I'm out of range.

07:06.091 --> 07:08.427
- <i>Copy, Car 86</i>
- Devil woman.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.429
Get somebody else
to do your bitch work.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.307
It's like I don't
know this chick.

07:13.515 --> 07:15.017
She's been here
for, like, six weeks

07:15.225 --> 07:16.894
and she thinks she runs
the place, you know?

07:17.102 --> 07:19.229
Not a real people person,
if you know what I mean.

07:19.438 --> 07:22.107
I don't get it, but it's
like somebody took a tampon

07:22.316 --> 07:23.609
and shoved it up
her [whistles]

07:23.817 --> 07:24.693
And forgot about it.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.112
Hey, it happens.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.781
I've seen it.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.283
Whoa!

07:31.492 --> 07:33.160
Hold onto your cocks,
dicks.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.714
Facebook
ain't got shit on this.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.843

He's getting away.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.321
Getting away?

08:09.530 --> 08:11.115

08:12.825 --> 08:15.035
Now, I don't
want to scare you boys,

08:15.244 --> 08:17.579
but Indy, it's one of the most dangerous
places in the nation right now.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.748
This type of stuff
is common.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.625
Now, I don't know
how this is gonna end,

08:21.834 --> 08:25.421
but I just wanted to let you
boys know to prepare yourself.

08:25.629 --> 08:27.089
You guys
ever shot a gun before?

08:27.297 --> 08:29.008
Yeah, yeah, I have.

08:29.216 --> 08:30.634
All right. Underneath
the seat, there are two boxes.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.260
A black box
and a white box.

08:32.469 --> 08:33.595
The black box
has the gun,

08:33.804 --> 08:35.304
and the white box
has the Taser.

08:35.514 --> 08:36.765
- Which has the gun?
- The black one.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.183
All right,
which has the Taser?

08:38.392 --> 08:39.977
- White one.
- All right. Good, good.

08:40.184 --> 08:42.855
All righty, here we go!

08:43.981 --> 08:45.274

09:43.874 --> 09:45.501
- No, no, no. I got the Taser.
- You shot him.

09:45.709 --> 09:46.543
You said the black box.
I got the Taser.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.754
That's what you said!

09:48.962 --> 09:50.297

- That's what I got!

09:50.506 --> 09:52.883
I said get the Taser!
Not the gun!

09:53.092 --> 09:54.301

10:27.000 --> 10:29.419
You know what
wasn't funny, Bateman?

10:30.587 --> 10:31.755
You hitting me in the face!

10:31.964 --> 10:34.341
That wasn't in the script!

10:34.550 --> 10:37.177
Improv! It just felt right
in the moment!

10:37.386 --> 10:38.679
But good God, though.

10:38.887 --> 10:40.305
Look at his face!
Look at... Look at!

10:40.514 --> 10:42.432
Oh, my... Oh, man!

10:42.641 --> 10:45.477
Oh, it's so good.
It's so good!

10:59.283 --> 11:02.578
All right,
mandatory pit-stop, fellas.

11:09.751 --> 11:12.212
All right,
let's get out of here.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.214
Nah, man,
we're just getting started.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.049
You want to stay after that?

11:16.258 --> 11:17.384
Whatever, dude.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.344
Just... just wait
until the sun goes down.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.263
It's gonna be dope, man,
like the hood and shit.

11:21.471 --> 11:22.472
We're gonna get
some golden footage.

11:22.681 --> 11:23.932
We live in Indianapolis,
Jeremy.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.434
There's not a hood here.

11:25.642 --> 11:26.768
Come on, dude.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.146
We never
just hang anymore.

11:29.354 --> 11:30.814
- What are you gonna...
- All right!

11:31.023 --> 11:32.482
All right!

11:32.691 --> 11:36.236
Fine, but any more shit
like that and we leave.

11:36.445 --> 11:37.988
Scout's honor.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.330
All right. You looked like a
bitch back there by the way.

11:46.538 --> 11:48.373
- Hey. You would have been that way, too.
- I'm just saying.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.125
- Just putting facts out there.
- I pulled out the Taser.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.585
"Oh, man, it was the Taser,
it was the Taser."

11:51.793 --> 11:53.003
You were sitting in the back
like a bitch, too.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.296
You didn't even
jump to the rescue.

11:54.504 --> 11:55.923
They didn't
have me on camera.

11:56.131 --> 11:57.507
Hey, man, don't spill.
I know it's Friday.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.468
I was your age once.

11:59.676 --> 12:01.637
Not too long ago,
you know.

12:01.845 --> 12:02.763
Here you go.

12:02.971 --> 12:04.765
- All right.
- Oh, yeah!

12:04.973 --> 12:06.558
Let me get
one of these things.

12:06.767 --> 12:07.935
What about me?

12:08.143 --> 12:11.605
You know,
somebody's got to drive.

12:11.813 --> 12:13.440
She's all yours.

12:15.567 --> 12:16.735
You pulling my dick?

12:16.944 --> 12:18.195
Hey,
no dick-pulling here.

12:18.403 --> 12:20.155
She's all yours, cuz.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.865
Be careful with her,
though, cuz, all right?

12:22.074 --> 12:23.158
Yes!

12:42.010 --> 12:43.887
I... I knew it!

12:44.096 --> 12:47.266
I knew it.
Chelsea Lyle did get a DUI.

12:47.474 --> 12:49.268
She could plow
through a bus stop full of kids.

12:49.476 --> 12:51.812
I'd gave her a warning
and my number.

12:52.020 --> 12:53.563
Man.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.816
I mean, is it the chin nub
that does it for you, Marcus?

12:56.024 --> 12:58.318
Actually,
it's the giant tits.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.778
You can't even see them.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.446
Yeah, but you know
they're there.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.407
Yeah, dude. She did
have some pretty big tits.

13:05.158 --> 13:06.201
Who the hell are you,
some kind of like Don Juan?

13:06.410 --> 13:07.494
You mean
you wouldn't hit that?

13:07.703 --> 13:09.621
Maybe,
I have some standards.

13:09.830 --> 13:13.458
Oh, you cannot have standards
when you're only into one girl.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.503
Ooh... gossip.

13:16.712 --> 13:17.963
What's her name?
What's her name?!

13:18.171 --> 13:19.256
- Check this out.
- There isn't a name.

13:19.464 --> 13:20.549
- Emma Harris.
- How you spell it?

13:20.757 --> 13:21.967
- E-M-M-A.
- Jeremy, seriously!

13:22.175 --> 13:24.303
- Cut it out! I'm serious!
- H-A-R-R-I-S.

13:24.511 --> 13:26.346
Bam. Whoa!

13:26.555 --> 13:27.973
She is smokin' hot.

13:28.181 --> 13:30.058
And that's
her license pic.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.893
Imagine what she looks
like in real life.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.438
Man, please tell me
you are hittin' that.

13:34.646 --> 13:35.897
- Nah. He wishes.
- Please.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.482
She wanted some
from him so bad, though,

13:37.691 --> 13:39.484
but this guy
was too stupid to see.

13:39.693 --> 13:43.071
OK. He's making it sound like
she was throwing herself at me.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.699
She was, man,
and everybody knew it.

13:45.907 --> 13:47.617
Why do you think
she kept inviting you

13:47.826 --> 13:49.036
down to the lake house when
her parents weren't home?

13:49.244 --> 13:51.330
Oh,
her parents weren't home?

13:51.538 --> 13:54.041
And Steve liked her, too.
Like, a lot, a lot.

13:54.207 --> 13:56.043
But Prince Hairy Bush
over here

13:56.251 --> 13:58.003
was either too stupid or too
dickless to make a move.

13:58.211 --> 13:59.796
Dude, you have
got to shave that shit.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.423
It's not true.

14:01.631 --> 14:02.841
I was... I just didn't know
how to approach her.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.217
I was trying
to be a gentleman.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.635
By What?

14:05.844 --> 14:07.054
Not giving the girl
what she wanted?

14:07.262 --> 14:08.472
The gentlemanly thing
to do

14:08.680 --> 14:13.018
is to say thank you
and to head downtown.

14:13.226 --> 14:16.063
You mean like downtown?

14:16.271 --> 14:18.065
Down-town.

14:18.273 --> 14:19.316
Whoa! Listen, dude.

14:19.524 --> 14:21.318
She may have
the holiest of holy,

14:21.526 --> 14:23.570
but my donut-eater ain't going
nowhere near that honeypot.

14:23.779 --> 14:24.780
I'm telling... Hey! Hey!

14:24.988 --> 14:26.448
OK. Check this out.

14:26.656 --> 14:29.034
You like it when girls
go down on you, right?

14:29.242 --> 14:30.118
Dude, I love that shit.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.703
Well, so do they, man.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.330
I'm telling you,
it's the 21st century.

14:33.538 --> 14:35.207
Chicks are just dudes
with tits these days.

14:35.415 --> 14:37.042
I can kind of hear
what you're selling.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.293
All right, all right.

14:38.502 --> 14:39.878
But all the rug munching
in the world

14:40.087 --> 14:41.421
ain't going to help you
with Emma now, bro.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.840
What's that supposed
to mean, Jeremy?

14:44.049 --> 14:45.759
Do you think she's
out of my league?

14:45.967 --> 14:47.761
She's always been
out of your league, dude.

14:47.969 --> 14:50.013
But that's not it,
man.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.766
I'm telling you, Emma is definitely
not the girl you used to know.

14:52.974 --> 14:54.726
No, I know that.
I've seen her Facebook page.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.396
She's got the nose ring
going, and the new look.

14:57.604 --> 14:58.814
And I'm diggin' it.

14:59.022 --> 15:01.108
Of course you are.
It's hot. I know.

15:01.316 --> 15:03.777
But when beautiful girls
like that have a nose ring,

15:03.985 --> 15:05.237
it's for a reason, man.

15:05.445 --> 15:07.197
What the hell does
that mean?

15:07.406 --> 15:08.698
It means she's feisty.

15:08.907 --> 15:11.034
More like she'd eat Steve up
and spit him out.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.327
I'd love to see that.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.578
I would love to see that.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.163
She would not eat me up.

15:15.372 --> 15:16.415
- Yes, she would.
- I'd eat her up,

15:16.623 --> 15:18.417
'cause I'm a wild tiger!

15:18.625 --> 15:22.295
And I'd go ranngrrrr!

15:27.843 --> 15:31.430
Don't ever say that
in this car again.

15:31.638 --> 15:33.765
Ever. Like, in life.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.565
OK, bigshot.
Let's see if she's home.

15:41.773 --> 15:45.652
All right. Pimpmobile 86
coming in hot!

15:45.861 --> 15:48.864
Hold on, no,
we don't have to do that.

15:51.199 --> 15:52.534
Uh...

15:52.742 --> 15:54.369
Uh, guys, guys.
We don't have to do that.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.664
Oh, come on!

16:11.970 --> 16:14.264
Emma Harris.
Come out with your hands up!

16:14.473 --> 16:16.183
- Emma!
- Come here!

16:16.391 --> 16:17.392
Shut up.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.019
- Shut up.
- Get off of me.

16:19.227 --> 16:21.271
Jeremy, what...

16:21.480 --> 16:26.693
Steve? Steve Marra?

16:26.902 --> 16:29.404
The prodigal son returns.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.156
I haven't seen you
since you left Indy

16:31.364 --> 16:33.658
and became
too good for us.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.620
Come here.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.875
Uh, what's that?

16:42.083 --> 16:43.460
It's a ride along.

16:43.668 --> 16:46.796
Lieutenant Officer Marcus
Wilder at your service.

16:47.005 --> 16:50.342
But you,
you can call me Marcus.

16:50.550 --> 16:51.843
Or you can call me
Thundereagle.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.678
That's my call sign.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.140
Awesome.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.059
It's nice to meet you,
Marcus. I'm Emma.

16:59.267 --> 17:00.977
Emma. Emma.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.650
Wow.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.027
I've never seen a cop car
look like this.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.404
Oh, it's a special edition
pursuit-rated vehicle.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.781
It's built for hunting
the baddest on the road.

17:13.990 --> 17:17.160
Zero to 60 faster than a
hobo on a ham sandwich.

17:22.123 --> 17:25.085
It looks like something
out of <i>RoboCop.</i>

17:25.292 --> 17:26.795
Yeah,
she's a real beaut, huh?

17:27.002 --> 17:29.714
We've been riding
around in her all day.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.841
I don't know
if you knew this, but, uh,

17:32.050 --> 17:35.095
Indy's actually one of the most
dangerous places in the nation, so...

17:35.303 --> 17:38.348
You know, we just wanted to come
see where all the shit goes down.

17:44.854 --> 17:46.356
Hey, nope, nope, asshole.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.857
Get in the back.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.299
Brunette,

237 Hollybrook Court. 35.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.638
MILF, right?
5'3", 110 pounds.

19:41.846 --> 19:43.306
- Oh, she's tiny.
- I know her.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.309
Ah. 1200 on her SAT.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.270
Oh, she lost
her virginity at 15.

19:51.606 --> 19:52.899
I'm just kidding.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.693
You can't tell
from looking at the screen.

19:54.901 --> 19:56.194
Be nice
if you could though, huh?

19:56.403 --> 19:58.321
Hell, I don't know when
she got her cherry popped,

19:58.530 --> 20:00.615
but she is smokin'!

20:02.492 --> 20:03.660
I'm sorry.

20:03.868 --> 20:06.413

21:12.520 --> 21:15.356
Brandie Roddenfield.

21:17.066 --> 21:18.401
What a douche.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.069
Does he actually think
that's going to work?

21:20.278 --> 21:21.446
You'd be surprised.

21:21.654 --> 21:24.491
Girls appreciate
a guy with balls.

21:27.660 --> 21:30.371
What?! Oh, my God,
what is she doing?!

21:31.581 --> 21:33.917
Oh, shit!

21:42.342 --> 21:44.928
Did she see us?

21:45.136 --> 21:46.387
I don't think so.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.684
The radio, the radio.

21:54.395 --> 21:56.606
Officer down.
We have an officer down.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.358
Say over,
you got to say over.

21:58.566 --> 22:02.445
This is car 86.
We have an officer dow...

22:05.156 --> 22:07.659
Drive, Steve! Drive! Drive!

22:15.500 --> 22:17.544
Shit.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.217
It's OK. We're OK.

22:24.425 --> 22:27.053
It's OK.
It's over, we're OK.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.305
I don't think so, man.
She just got up!

22:29.514 --> 22:30.974
I just hit her with a car
really damn hard!

22:31.182 --> 22:32.475
How could she just get up?

22:32.684 --> 22:33.977
Dude, I know what I saw!
She made it!

22:34.185 --> 22:35.562
Why is she attacking us?

22:35.770 --> 22:37.397
We saw what she did to Marcus!
We're witnesses!

22:37.605 --> 22:38.606
Maybe she was on drugs.

22:38.815 --> 22:39.774
Maybe she's not human!

22:39.983 --> 22:41.234
Maybe you're an idiot!

22:41.442 --> 22:43.152
Car 86, do you read me?

22:43.361 --> 22:45.697
- Answer it.
- No, no, no! Don't... don't, man!

22:45.905 --> 22:47.282
- But why not?
- I don't know.

22:47.490 --> 22:48.867
Are you crazy?

22:49.075 --> 22:51.578
<i>Car 86, I repeat,
do you read me?</i>

22:51.786 --> 22:53.162
<i>Respond. Over.</i>

22:55.206 --> 22:56.416
What about Marcus?

22:59.419 --> 23:01.921
Help! This is Car 86!
We have an officer down!

23:02.130 --> 23:04.090
Officer Wilder
was just attacked. He's...

23:04.299 --> 23:05.884
<i>Ma'am, please calm down.</i>

23:06.092 --> 23:08.845
<i>I'll need you to follow
my exact instructions</i>

23:09.053 --> 23:10.138
<i>so we can get you to safety.</i>

23:10.346 --> 23:12.849
<i>Proceed to 1720 Kent Avenue.</i>

23:13.057 --> 23:15.351
What about Marcus?

23:15.560 --> 23:17.937
<i>An officer will meet you there
to escort you to the station.</i>

23:18.146 --> 23:21.232
<i>Keep this channel clear
for police communication only.</i>

23:21.441 --> 23:24.152
<i>Proceed
to Kent Ave immediately.</i>

23:42.378 --> 23:46.507
Is this
an abandoned building?

23:46.716 --> 23:48.301
Jeremy, are you sure you put
the address in correctly?

23:48.509 --> 23:50.720
I put it in correctly.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.555
There's no way
this is right.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.312
Hello,
this is car 86.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.439
We've arrived
at the location.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.274
No one is here.

24:03.483 --> 24:04.859
Over.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.986
Is there anyone here? Over.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.035
Why isn't she responding?

24:14.243 --> 24:16.204
I need some air.

24:16.412 --> 24:20.833
No, I don't think that we should
get out of the car, Emma.

24:22.251 --> 24:23.878
I was wrong, man.

24:24.087 --> 24:25.922
Look like she's
totally into you.

24:43.731 --> 24:45.608
<i>Dispatch
to any unit in range.</i>

24:45.817 --> 24:48.945
<i>We have a Code 10-31
on Route 44 at Washington Ave.</i>

24:49.153 --> 24:50.571
<i>Over.</i>

24:52.156 --> 24:54.450
Dispatch, Car 14.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.285
I'm arriving on the scene.

24:56.494 --> 24:57.996
We've got a black SUV.

24:58.204 --> 25:01.457
Appears to be idling.
No one's in sight.

25:01.666 --> 25:02.834
I'm going to check it out.

25:03.042 --> 25:05.003
<i>Copy that. Proceed.</i>

25:43.624 --> 25:46.627
Dispatch, Car 14.
There's no signs of anyone.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.796
The vehicle does
appear to be abandoned.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.590
<i>Copy that, 14.
No suspects found.</i>

25:50.798 --> 25:53.301
<i>Stand by
for vehicle removal. Over.</i>

25:53.509 --> 25:54.552
Copy that.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.779
I don't like this.

26:12.987 --> 26:14.781
You don't like what?

26:14.989 --> 26:17.158
This spot.
This situation.

26:17.366 --> 26:19.410
The dispatcher.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.913
I don't like
any of it.

26:22.121 --> 26:25.666
When we called it in, how
did she know where we were?

27:08.292 --> 27:09.544
Aah!

27:30.648 --> 27:32.775
Run!

27:33.901 --> 27:36.320
- Jeremy! Jeremy!
- Jeremy!

27:47.707 --> 27:49.667
Steve! Emma!

27:49.876 --> 27:51.210
Come on!

27:58.259 --> 28:00.344
Right here!

28:00.553 --> 28:04.307
Right here.
Right here.

28:04.515 --> 28:06.267
It's her. It's Brandie.

28:06.475 --> 28:08.394
I hit her with a car.

28:08.603 --> 28:09.937
I saw her face.

28:16.068 --> 28:17.612
Shit. Shit. Shit.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.370
You know
how to use that thing?

28:26.579 --> 28:30.166
Yeah. OK.

28:30.374 --> 28:32.501
OK, OK.
On three, we just run.

28:32.710 --> 28:34.503
No looking back.
Just run.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.547
Run?
She'll shoot us if we run.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.758
Better a moving target,
plus...

28:40.718 --> 28:42.970
OK, we're ready.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.055
One.

28:44.263 --> 28:45.348
Run!

28:45.556 --> 28:47.516
What the hell?!
You said on three!

28:47.725 --> 28:49.227
Three, three, three,
three, three!

28:55.816 --> 28:57.026
It's all
right, lay in the back!

28:57.235 --> 28:58.694
Get in the back!

29:52.415 --> 29:54.709
What the fuck was that?

29:54.917 --> 29:56.502
"What" is exactly
the right question.

29:56.711 --> 29:59.505
That thing
definitely wasn't human.

29:59.714 --> 30:02.425
What did I say about
your conspiracy bullshit?

30:02.633 --> 30:04.719
You seriously think
that thing wasn't human?

30:04.927 --> 30:07.179
Well, it sure as shit
wasn't Sasquatch, Jeremy.

30:07.388 --> 30:08.764
Of course not.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.141
Sasquatch lives
in the Pacific Northwest.

30:10.349 --> 30:11.684
Everybody knows that, man.

30:11.892 --> 30:13.144
But I think we're dealing
with a Jangling.

30:13.352 --> 30:14.895
That's a beer.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.939
One second.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.524
She was shooting a gun,
Jeremy!

30:18.733 --> 30:21.235
I'm aware of that.
According to Ill Dr. Phil,

30:21.444 --> 30:24.322
a lot of paranormals can do the
things us normal normals can do.

30:24.530 --> 30:26.824
Like drive a forklift,
drink coffee, do yoga.

30:27.033 --> 30:30.411
Janglings. Ah, here it is. Janglings.
Look. Look, man.

30:30.619 --> 30:32.455
<i>One of the most
recent and intriguing theories</i>

30:32.663 --> 30:34.957
<i>in the field of exo-biology
is the Jangling,</i>

30:35.166 --> 30:38.753
<i>or as it's known in popular
culture, the bodysnatcher.</i>

30:38.961 --> 30:40.463
<i>Much like
their movie counterparts,</i>

30:40.671 --> 30:42.590
<i>Janglings have been
described to possess</i>

30:42.798 --> 30:46.344
<i>increased strength and resilience
compared to their human host.</i>

30:46.552 --> 30:49.180
<i>A lack of emotion
and loss of unique identity</i>

30:49.388 --> 30:52.224
<i>are also traits popularly
associated with Janglings.</i>

30:52.433 --> 30:54.310
<i>But the most intriguing
speculations</i>

30:54.518 --> 30:57.563
<i>are made about their method
of communication... telepathy.</i>

30:57.772 --> 31:00.566
<i>Recently a coalition of groups
dedicated to the study</i>

31:00.775 --> 31:02.318
- <i>of extraterrestrial life...</i>
- Listen to this now.

31:02.526 --> 31:04.487
<i>...reported an alarming spike
in cases</i>

31:04.695 --> 31:06.238
<i>consistent with the established
Jangling theory.</i>

31:06.447 --> 31:08.491
<i>If their existence
proves to be real,</i>

31:08.699 --> 31:13.496
<i>the question remains, are
they here as friend or foe?</i>

31:13.704 --> 31:16.040
Foe, pretty clearly foe.

31:16.248 --> 31:18.542
This guy actually named
himself Ill Dr. Phil?

31:18.751 --> 31:20.878
Ill Dr. Phil
is his call sign.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.713
If his actual identity
was exposed,

31:22.922 --> 31:24.715
he'd be dead
within 24 hours.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.592
Who knows how many agencies
want his head.

31:26.801 --> 31:29.762
Because he's a whack job,
and so are you.

31:29.970 --> 31:32.765
You know what, call me one more
name, and I'll stick my foot...

31:32.973 --> 31:34.433
What?!
You'll sick E.T. on me?

31:34.642 --> 31:35.893
E.T.'s a fictional
film character, dick.

31:36.102 --> 31:37.478
This is real life.

31:37.686 --> 31:38.604
Body snatchers
and telepathy?

31:38.813 --> 31:40.439
That's real life to you?

31:40.648 --> 31:42.983
OK, you know what,
you have a better theory?

31:43.192 --> 31:44.318
Let's hear it.

31:47.029 --> 31:48.030
I got it.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.032
OK. Perfect.
Shoot

31:50.241 --> 31:52.493
OK.

31:52.701 --> 31:55.204
I'm thinking Marcus
was a dirty cop, right?

31:55.413 --> 31:56.997
And we're
caught up between...

31:57.206 --> 31:58.791
between the Indianapolis
Police Department

31:58.999 --> 32:01.085
and the Zetas
down in Mexico, yeah?

32:01.293 --> 32:03.921
And they've loaded 300 pounds of
cocaine into the trunk of this car.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.465
And Brandie, Brandie's probably
one of their sleeper cell...

32:06.674 --> 32:09.260
You know what?
You're right.

32:09.468 --> 32:11.137
Thank you.

32:11.345 --> 32:13.431
We should check the trunk.

32:24.775 --> 32:26.318
Well, I'm satisfied.

32:26.527 --> 32:28.487
Wrong again, Steve.

32:28.696 --> 32:30.072
You're unbelievable.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.699
<i>Dispatch to all units.</i>

32:31.907 --> 32:33.784
<i>We have an A.P.B.
on three suspects,</i>

32:33.993 --> 32:36.620
<i>last seen headed north
on Binford Boulevard</i>

32:36.829 --> 32:38.831
<i>in stolen police vehicle 86.</i>

32:39.039 --> 32:41.792
<i>Suspects are two male
and one female.</i>

32:42.001 --> 32:44.837
<i>Female is Caucasian,
5'6", brunette,</i>

32:45.045 --> 32:46.922
<i>approximately
23 years of age.</i>

32:47.131 --> 32:49.383
<i>One man is 5'10",
athletic build.</i>

32:49.592 --> 32:53.012
The other male is 5'8", slender
build, wearing black glasses.

32:53.220 --> 32:56.432
<i>Suspects are wanted for the
murder of a police officer.</i>

32:56.640 --> 33:00.436
<i>Please be advised suspects
are armed and dangerous.</i>

33:03.105 --> 33:04.815
Marcus is dead.

33:11.405 --> 33:13.240
How does she know
what we look like?

33:13.449 --> 33:15.576
She had
our exact profiles.

33:16.952 --> 33:19.830
We need to turn
ourselves in right now.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.999
No' no' no.
Are you crazy?

33:22.166 --> 33:24.376
You heard what she said.
They think we killed Marcus.

33:24.585 --> 33:26.545
But we have proof.
We have the glasses.

33:26.754 --> 33:29.006
- What?
- There's a camera inside of his glasses.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.799
Then let's show it
to the police.

33:31.008 --> 33:32.218
No, no, no. No, we can't
show it to the police,

33:32.426 --> 33:33.344
because they're in on it.

33:33.552 --> 33:35.012
In on what, Jeremy?

33:35.221 --> 33:37.097
I don't know.
The whole Brandie thing.

33:37.306 --> 33:39.183
The dispatcher
who set us up earlier.

33:39.391 --> 33:41.852
Why would she do that?

33:42.061 --> 33:43.979
Because we know
too much, man.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.940
We literally know nothing!

33:47.733 --> 33:50.152
OK, the dispatcher told us to
go to the warehouse, right?

33:50.361 --> 33:53.656
And Brandie shows up.
Coincidence?

33:53.864 --> 33:55.616
So we run.

33:55.824 --> 33:57.993
Do you know what happens at the
end of a manhunt for cop killers?

33:58.202 --> 33:59.703
Do you remember
Chris Dorner?

33:59.912 --> 34:01.580
That scenario does
not end well for us, man!

34:01.789 --> 34:03.207
I know, exactly.
It's a conspir...

34:03.415 --> 34:04.750
It's a conspiracy.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.253
And the patsy never
lives to tell the tale.

34:07.461 --> 34:10.089
Haven't they taught you
any history at Fordham, Steve?

34:10.297 --> 34:12.007
Think about it.
Lee Harvey Oswald,

34:12.216 --> 34:14.467
Sirhan Sirhan,
William T. Piper.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.262
We do not run.

34:16.469 --> 34:18.639
Guilty people run.

34:18.847 --> 34:22.184
Let's just find someone we trust
and show them the footage.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.811
OK, OK.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.813
But we actually need to make
sure we have the footage.

34:27.022 --> 34:28.107
We need a USB cord.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.358
OK, I have
plenty at my house.

34:29.567 --> 34:30.818
- It's not...
- Whoa, whoa.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.735
We can't go to anyone's house.

34:32.945 --> 34:37.699
Whatever goes down, we stay the
hell away from our families.

34:37.908 --> 34:39.368
We can't risk it.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.121
Then what?

34:45.708 --> 34:47.376
I have an idea.

35:10.899 --> 35:13.986
All right, guys,
stay here.

35:14.194 --> 35:15.738
Honk if you see
anything weird.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.616
Weirder.

35:36.967 --> 35:39.637
So...

35:39.845 --> 35:43.057
are you seeing anyone?

35:45.893 --> 35:47.645
Steve,
are you hitting on me?

35:47.853 --> 35:49.021
What?

35:50.731 --> 35:52.483
Now? No.

36:01.241 --> 36:04.119
Larry, my man.
What's the word?

36:11.126 --> 36:12.544
You OK, Larry?

36:12.753 --> 36:14.672
Party a little too hard
last night?

36:14.880 --> 36:16.048
One too many whippets?

36:16.256 --> 36:17.800
Uh. Uh.

36:19.551 --> 36:21.261
You gotta lay off
that stuff, bro.

36:21.470 --> 36:23.389
It's going to fry
your brain.

36:36.276 --> 36:38.696
Well,
I'm not seeing anyone.

36:40.447 --> 36:44.368
I'm looking
for that right person.

36:44.576 --> 36:47.162
You know,
someone you connect with.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.497
You know?

36:59.883 --> 37:04.722
Steve Marra is having
trouble meeting girls.

37:04.930 --> 37:07.099
God, it's shocking.

37:07.307 --> 37:12.271
It's not that I'm having
trouble meeting girls.

37:12.479 --> 37:15.190
More that I'm having trouble
meeting the right girl.

37:16.483 --> 37:18.610
I had a plan.

37:20.362 --> 37:24.116
Work hard in high school,
graduate college with honors,

37:24.324 --> 37:26.744
start a career,
court a lady,

37:26.952 --> 37:28.871
have kids, buy a dog,

37:29.079 --> 37:31.165
build a tree house
in the back.

37:31.373 --> 37:33.250
Real American dream.

37:36.628 --> 37:37.755
Yeah.

37:39.173 --> 37:41.550
That's what I was told.

37:45.095 --> 37:47.055
Sounds like it didn't
work out for someone.

37:48.390 --> 37:49.850
Let me get this one.

37:50.058 --> 37:51.101
You went on
a dozen job interviews,

37:51.310 --> 37:52.561
and at every single one,

37:52.770 --> 37:55.522
there were 12 dudes
who looked just like you?

37:57.900 --> 38:02.988
All with college degrees,
all desperate for work.

38:03.197 --> 38:06.074
And one day it hits me,
what's the point of it all?

38:08.619 --> 38:10.996
So here I am.

38:11.205 --> 38:12.748
Right back
where I started.

38:15.918 --> 38:17.878
What about you?

38:18.086 --> 38:19.546
Are you happy?

38:19.755 --> 38:22.800
Living here?
I mean...

38:25.636 --> 38:27.346
You don't see me bitching,
do you?

38:29.473 --> 38:32.142
You didn't
answer my question.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.939
They're my family,
Steve.

38:39.983 --> 38:42.319
When Mom got sick,
I did what I had to do.

38:45.614 --> 38:47.282
I'm glad I did it.

38:50.994 --> 38:52.996
No one should have
to go through that alone.

38:54.623 --> 38:58.043
But, yeah, you're right.

39:00.170 --> 39:02.965
After being here my whole
life, I just feel stuck.

39:09.304 --> 39:14.852
I know it sounds selfish,
but I'm young.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.939
I want to backpack
through Europe.

39:20.816 --> 39:24.069
Cliff dive off a beach
in Thailand.

39:24.278 --> 39:27.155
Hell, I would settle
for falling in love

39:27.364 --> 39:30.158
while spelunking
in New Mexico.

39:33.495 --> 39:36.707
I just want to know I exist
outside of this place.

39:39.334 --> 39:40.586
You know?

39:44.506 --> 39:46.341
That's life.

39:46.550 --> 39:49.887
We're lucky to experience
anything at all, so...

39:52.264 --> 39:53.640
we shouldn't waste it.

40:04.067 --> 40:06.612
Well, I'm stuck here,
too, now,

40:06.820 --> 40:08.614
'cause someone has
to take care of that asshole.

40:22.711 --> 40:25.380
You sure you're OK, man?

40:25.589 --> 40:29.801
Oh. I'm OK.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.720
Finally, he speaks.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.306
Usually can't
get you to shut up.

40:34.514 --> 40:38.560
I'm just going to pay
for this and this.

40:38.769 --> 40:43.065
Hey. Can I get
you anything else?

40:44.816 --> 40:46.777
Another meat stick?

40:46.985 --> 40:48.862
A meat stick?

40:49.071 --> 40:50.197
Nah, man. I'm good.

40:50.405 --> 40:52.240
One meat stick
is enough for me.

41:00.707 --> 41:03.251
My God, today, man.

41:14.179 --> 41:16.223
There you go.

41:19.267 --> 41:21.144
Jesus.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.815
What about
the roadhouse chili?

41:38.328 --> 41:39.579
Here he is.

41:45.627 --> 41:46.878
All right.

41:47.087 --> 41:48.422
What took you?

41:48.630 --> 41:51.508
Larry. He's acting
all weird, man.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.552
Weird or high?

41:53.760 --> 41:55.012
Weird weird.

41:58.181 --> 41:59.641
Check the footage.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.453
OK, we don't need
to see this.

42:19.661 --> 42:20.620
Fast-forward.

42:20.829 --> 42:22.122
OK, stop.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.589
Brandie, what are you?

42:39.014 --> 42:40.766
Now what?

42:40.974 --> 42:43.810
Got to get it
to somebody we can trust.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.937
Who do you trust?

42:46.146 --> 42:47.481
No one.

42:47.689 --> 42:49.941
What the hell, Jeremy?
This was your plan.

42:50.150 --> 42:52.194
It's not my plan.
It was Emma's plan.

42:52.402 --> 42:54.529
I just knew
where to get the USB cord.

42:58.241 --> 42:59.618
OK, we have
to get out of here.

42:59.826 --> 43:01.661
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.707
Go, go, go, go, go!

44:07.227 --> 44:08.728
Right.

44:12.941 --> 44:15.110
Stomp on the goddamn pedal,
Steve!

44:17.654 --> 44:18.822
Watch out!

44:36.923 --> 44:38.341
Shit, shit.

45:31.102 --> 45:32.771
<i>All cars be advised,</i>

45:32.979 --> 45:35.774
<i>suspects were last seen heading
south on Cold Creek.</i>

45:35.982 --> 45:37.817
<i>They are armed and dangerous.</i>

45:38.026 --> 45:41.238
<i>I repeat, they are
armed and dangerous.</i>

45:41.446 --> 45:45.116
Use of lethal force
is approved.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.427
Maybe you do need glasses.

46:04.636 --> 46:07.055
What? This thing's
a freakin' hand cannon.

46:07.264 --> 46:09.516
Knock yourself
over unloading it.

46:10.976 --> 46:12.560
All right.
That's a lot of gun, Emma.

46:12.769 --> 46:13.937
You got to be
really careful.

46:14.145 --> 46:15.188
That thing has a lot...

46:17.023 --> 46:20.151
Yeah, it's got some kick.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.695
Whoa,
how'd you do that?

46:21.903 --> 46:24.155
Remember that lake house
down in Bloomington?

46:26.324 --> 46:27.617
The one where you
used to invite him

46:27.826 --> 46:29.202
when your parents
weren't using it, right?

46:29.411 --> 46:32.038
But he was too much
of a pussy to show up?

46:32.247 --> 46:34.207
I didn't know that your parents...

46:34.416 --> 46:36.251
- ...parents
weren't going to be there.

46:36.459 --> 46:38.795
Why else would I invite
you to my lake house?

46:42.882 --> 46:45.135
This is a .44 Special.

46:45.343 --> 46:49.389
It's got
major stopping power.

46:49.597 --> 46:54.102
It's the reason Dirty Harry over
there was having so much trouble.

46:54.311 --> 46:55.729
Really?

47:02.569 --> 47:04.070
Here, let me show you.

47:04.279 --> 47:07.782
Get your legs shoulder-width
apart and get rooted.

47:07.991 --> 47:08.992
All right.

47:09.200 --> 47:12.412
Now, this is the sight.

47:12.620 --> 47:15.832
So line it up with that dot
on the end and let her rip.

47:23.965 --> 47:26.426
All right, now.

47:26.634 --> 47:29.179
Close your left eye
and look down the sight

47:29.387 --> 47:31.848
only with your right eye,
OK?

47:34.225 --> 47:35.560
What is he doing?

47:40.065 --> 47:42.067
I think he's having
a seizure.

47:42.275 --> 47:43.485
Holy shit,
you can't wink, can you?

47:43.693 --> 47:45.403
I can't close just one eye.

47:45.612 --> 47:47.072
I have never met
someone who can't wink.

47:47.280 --> 47:48.531
Is that a thing?

47:48.740 --> 47:50.492
Yeah, actually,
36% the population

47:50.700 --> 47:52.952
doesn't have voluntary
unilateral eyelid closure.

47:53.161 --> 47:55.413
I think that number
is a little high.

48:02.670 --> 48:04.547
OK.

48:05.673 --> 48:07.175
Here, hold on.

48:07.384 --> 48:09.594
Try this.

48:19.479 --> 48:21.689
Yeah!

48:21.898 --> 48:23.691
Look at that.

48:26.611 --> 48:28.947
You are without a doubt
the worst pirate

48:29.155 --> 48:32.617
I've ever seen,
Captain Jackoff Sparrow.

48:32.826 --> 48:35.495
Yeah, but
at least I can hit a can.

48:39.165 --> 48:40.041
Check this out.

48:41.668 --> 48:43.461
I'm more
of a short-range expert.

48:47.006 --> 48:48.800
Stop! Police!
Put your hands in the air!

48:49.008 --> 48:50.135
Get on the ground!

48:50.343 --> 48:52.554
Get down
on the ground now!

49:00.854 --> 49:02.647
How'd they find us?

49:07.902 --> 49:09.737
Come on, Emma.
Take them out.

49:09.946 --> 49:12.073
I'm not going
to shoot a cop.

49:12.282 --> 49:13.783
They might not be cops.

49:13.992 --> 49:15.827
They might
not be Janglings.

49:21.875 --> 49:23.001
Run!

49:23.209 --> 49:24.919
No, Jeremy!

49:26.963 --> 49:29.340
Stop right there!

49:29.549 --> 49:32.635
When I catch you,
I'm going to kick your ass!

49:49.194 --> 49:52.363
Turn around! Turn around!

49:52.572 --> 49:54.032
We're being set up!
We're innocent!

49:54.240 --> 49:55.533
- We didn't do anything!
- Get on the ground.

49:55.742 --> 49:57.160
Get on the ground.

49:57.368 --> 49:58.828
Stay on the ground.

49:59.037 --> 50:00.872
Put your hands behind your back,
both of you.

50:03.082 --> 50:05.168
You're under arrest for
the murder of Officer Colfax.

50:05.376 --> 50:07.253
Who... Who's Colfax?

50:11.216 --> 50:13.051
We are so screwed?

50:13.259 --> 50:15.261
Who's Colfax?

50:15.470 --> 50:18.181
<i>What's your 20?</i>

50:18.389 --> 50:20.183
No!

50:22.101 --> 50:24.020
Go ahead. Car 64.

50:26.481 --> 50:28.566
<i>Stay at your
location till backup arrives.</i>

50:28.775 --> 50:30.401
Copy that.

50:30.610 --> 50:31.986
You can't listen to her.

50:32.195 --> 50:35.114
Som... Someone
is trying to kill us,

50:35.323 --> 50:36.491
and she's helping them.

50:36.699 --> 50:38.743
No. Uh-uh.
You don't get to talk.

50:38.952 --> 50:40.119
She's sending other people.

50:40.328 --> 50:42.580
Shut the hell up!

50:42.789 --> 50:44.832
You don't get to talk!

50:44.999 --> 50:46.668
Excuse me, Officer,

50:46.876 --> 50:49.295
technically it's within our
Miranda rights that we can speak.

50:49.504 --> 50:52.549
Please, you don't even
know what Miranda rights are.

50:52.757 --> 50:54.175
You underestimated
the wrong guy.

50:54.384 --> 50:56.511
I took Law 101.

50:56.719 --> 50:58.471
I have the right
to remain silent.

50:58.680 --> 51:01.307
I have the right
for protection from, uh...

51:01.516 --> 51:03.184
Steve?

51:05.103 --> 51:06.646
Thanks.

51:08.523 --> 51:11.484
Officers, please.
We're innocent.

51:11.693 --> 51:13.444
Just shut the hell up!

51:13.653 --> 51:17.490
A cop is dead, another one's
missing, you're in his car!

51:17.699 --> 51:19.325
That's all
I need to believe!

51:19.534 --> 51:20.994
We didn't kill anyone.

51:21.202 --> 51:22.745
We know who did, though.

51:22.954 --> 51:24.706
We have the video.

51:24.914 --> 51:28.209
It... it's on the camera
from the glasses right here.

51:36.217 --> 51:38.261
OK, I've seen enough.

51:58.489 --> 52:01.326
We just need to try
and explain everything.

52:01.534 --> 52:03.202
Yeah, good luck with that.

52:03.411 --> 52:06.456
You know what? How about
some constructive criticism?

52:06.664 --> 52:08.249
Oh, that's right.
I guess that's hard

52:08.416 --> 52:10.251
when you're out there running
like a little bitch.

52:10.460 --> 52:13.004
I don't run like a bitch.
I run normal.

52:13.212 --> 52:15.923
I mean that you left us
out there to die,

52:16.132 --> 52:19.510
and I'd call that running
like a bitch.

52:19.719 --> 52:21.054
Oh, you mean
I ditched you?

52:21.262 --> 52:23.765
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

52:23.973 --> 52:26.059
Kinda like
how you ditched me?

52:28.061 --> 52:30.605
Ditched you?
When did I ever ditch you?

52:30.813 --> 52:33.149
When you disappeared
on me, man.

52:33.358 --> 52:35.276
You went to Fordham,

52:35.485 --> 52:38.821
and I didn't see you
for four years. Literally.

52:40.156 --> 52:41.991
We were supposed
to be best friends, man.

52:42.200 --> 52:45.536
Supposed to
have each other's back.

52:45.745 --> 52:48.247
But you cashed out
just like that.

52:50.708 --> 52:52.293
I never got a call.

52:52.502 --> 52:54.796
You text me,
like, two times.

52:55.004 --> 52:57.382
You ditched me.

52:57.590 --> 52:58.758
That's a fact.

52:58.966 --> 53:02.387
You want facts?
Here's a fact.

53:02.595 --> 53:07.266
We're here because you decided it
would be a good idea to play cops.

53:07.475 --> 53:11.062
- Steve...
- Here's another fact.

53:11.270 --> 53:13.606
You're right.

53:13.815 --> 53:16.609
I did ditch you.

53:16.818 --> 53:19.070
I couldn't listen to you
spew about the bullshit

53:19.278 --> 53:21.239
that was keeping us
down anymore.

53:22.740 --> 53:25.702
I outgrew that shit.
And I outgrew you.

53:29.288 --> 53:31.666
You really went and made
something of yourself, Steve.

53:31.874 --> 53:33.292
Great job.

53:45.430 --> 53:46.597
All right, lean up.

53:46.806 --> 53:47.807
I'm going
to take the cuffs off.

53:48.015 --> 53:49.225
When I take them off,

53:49.434 --> 53:50.560
I want you to put them
in the front.

53:50.768 --> 53:52.478
All right, now, listen.

53:52.687 --> 53:54.147
Here's
what we're going to do.

53:54.355 --> 53:56.274
We're going to take you
to our precinct

53:56.482 --> 53:57.692
instead
of downtown headquarters.

53:57.900 --> 53:59.360
I think you'll
be safer there, OK?

53:59.569 --> 54:01.612
Sound good?

54:01.821 --> 54:04.365
- Stop!
Police! Stop!

54:04.574 --> 54:05.950
Stop right there!

54:10.413 --> 54:12.206
Stop! Police!

54:21.549 --> 54:23.009
Stop!

54:27.013 --> 54:29.348
<i>All units, A.P.B. update.</i>

54:29.557 --> 54:31.934
<i>Suspects were last seen
heading north on 31.</i>

54:32.143 --> 54:33.478
<i>Believed
to be leaving the city.</i>

54:33.686 --> 54:35.104
We have to get out of town.
Get on 70.

54:35.313 --> 54:37.732
It'll get us out
of Indianapolis in 15 minutes.

54:37.940 --> 54:40.902
<i>Roadblocks needed at all
highway on-ramps north of Kessler.</i>

54:41.110 --> 54:43.154
<i>Suspects are believed to have
killed two more officers.</i>

54:53.581 --> 54:55.416
The bloody manhunt
continues today.

54:55.625 --> 54:56.834
<i>The new bodies were found.</i>

54:57.043 --> 54:58.878
<i>Fugitives

<i>If you have any information

as soon as possible.</i>

55:03.257 --> 55:05.259
<i>Now it's still unclear
what the motive is</i>

55:05.468 --> 55:07.845
<i>for these three to carry out
such horrific acts.</i>

55:08.054 --> 55:10.181
And authorities urging everyone
to stay inside tonight,

55:10.389 --> 55:11.933
lock their doors,
they say.

55:12.141 --> 55:13.810
<i>Police say if this
is purely a cry for help,</i>

55:14.018 --> 55:17.355
<i>there's no telling what
these kids might do next.</i>

55:25.112 --> 55:26.405
Eighty-six!

55:42.421 --> 55:45.132
Our faces are on the news.

55:48.845 --> 55:51.013
We got to find another way
out of Indianapolis.

55:51.222 --> 55:53.683
There is no other way.
They've locked down the city.

55:59.772 --> 56:01.566
We have to kill them.

56:02.733 --> 56:03.693
How?

56:03.901 --> 56:05.987
Mm. Headshots.

56:06.195 --> 56:08.865
Ill Doctor Phil
says that's the only way.

56:10.950 --> 56:12.577
Wait.

56:12.785 --> 56:15.204
You're really wanting to go
toe-to-toe with those things?

56:15.413 --> 56:17.331
We don't stand
a chance, man.

56:18.875 --> 56:21.210
They will never stop
following us.

56:23.212 --> 56:25.256
I'm not running anymore.

56:25.464 --> 56:27.300
We have to fight.

56:33.472 --> 56:38.227
<i>All units report any
unusual police activity immediately.</i>

56:38.436 --> 56:40.563
<i>Suspects
still remain at large.</i>

56:40.771 --> 56:42.189
<i>Over.</i>

56:47.528 --> 56:49.113
I have a plan.

56:56.787 --> 56:59.332
Hey, Larry.
How are you?

56:59.540 --> 57:03.169
Oh. I'm good.

57:03.377 --> 57:05.796
It's good to hear that.

57:06.005 --> 57:07.214
Listen...

57:11.093 --> 57:12.470
we're in trouble, Larry.

57:14.722 --> 57:16.933
We need help.

57:19.268 --> 57:20.394
I know it sounds crazy,

57:20.603 --> 57:22.480
but we're running
from the cops,

57:22.688 --> 57:25.399
and we're innocent,
I swear.

57:25.608 --> 57:28.235
We need help, but there's
no one we can trust.

57:33.699 --> 57:36.994
Can we trust you,
Larry?

57:42.208 --> 57:45.419
I said,
can we trust you, Larry?

57:45.628 --> 57:48.339
Uh-huh.

57:48.547 --> 57:50.633
We need a place to hide,
just until the morning.

57:52.093 --> 57:54.095
There's a dirt road.

57:56.013 --> 57:57.556
That way.

58:00.601 --> 58:01.978
That way?

58:02.186 --> 58:03.187
Yeah.

58:03.396 --> 58:06.524
A dirt road.

58:08.442 --> 58:09.735
Then".?

58:09.944 --> 58:11.445
You take it.

58:13.155 --> 58:16.409
To the end.

58:19.328 --> 58:21.914
What's at the end,
Larry?

58:23.290 --> 58:26.585
A safe place.

58:26.794 --> 58:28.713
Stay there.

58:28.921 --> 58:33.592
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much, Larry.

58:33.801 --> 58:36.846
Just, please,
don't tell anyone.

58:48.315 --> 58:49.483
How'd it go?

58:49.692 --> 58:51.444
He said he'd help us.

58:54.947 --> 58:56.323
How much?

58:57.950 --> 59:01.037
Free for you...

59:01.245 --> 59:02.496
...friend.

59:04.457 --> 59:07.043
You really are
a godsend, Larry.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:05.643
We don't have
very much time left.

01:00:05.851 --> 01:00:07.311
You ready?

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.814
Yep.

01:00:10.022 --> 01:00:11.524
I'll lure 'em into here.

01:00:11.732 --> 01:00:13.984
Right in the middle.

01:00:14.193 --> 01:00:15.444
You and Emma can flank them.

01:00:17.738 --> 01:00:19.573
Are you sure?

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.700
You're... you're going to
get a lot of heat up here.

01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:25.788
Nah, man. It'll be like
shooting fish in a barrel.

01:00:25.996 --> 01:00:27.915
And you think you can
shoot the fish?

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:31.168
Spray and pay all day, baby.

01:00:39.343 --> 01:00:42.138
Sorry I ditched you.

01:00:42.346 --> 01:00:44.473
No. Hey.

01:00:46.016 --> 01:00:47.268
I ditched you first.

01:00:47.476 --> 01:00:51.480
No, you didn't.
You had to become a man.

01:00:51.689 --> 01:00:54.441
Yeah.

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.945
And all I found out is that this
is where I'm supposed to be.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:01.782
Right here.
At this creepy-ass farm.

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:05.119
With you.

01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:06.453
For real?

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:08.873
For real reals.

01:01:10.124 --> 01:01:11.292
Hey.

01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:18.841
Bring it home.

01:01:19.049 --> 01:01:20.593
You be careful, OK?

01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:22.887
Jeremy.

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:26.140
See you on the other side.

01:01:26.348 --> 01:01:28.559
All right, you two.
Break it up.

01:01:28.767 --> 01:01:30.060
We got shit to do.

01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:35.024
I will be back.

01:01:55.252 --> 01:01:57.213
Yeah, this will work.

01:02:12.686 --> 01:02:14.021
Come here.

01:02:29.036 --> 01:02:30.496
Much better.

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:32.998
Thanks.

01:02:37.378 --> 01:02:41.632
So, are you
seeing anyone?

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:45.177
Are you hitting on me?

01:02:45.386 --> 01:02:47.513
What? Now?

01:02:47.721 --> 01:02:49.139
No.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:52.601
Is it working?

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:57.064
Are you sure
you weren't bodysnatched?

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:16.375
Shouldn't we go
spelunking first?

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.562
Ready?

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:51.417
Ah!

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.545
Aah!

01:09:18.694 --> 01:09:20.488
Aah!

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:36.712
Aah!

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.783
Aaah! Yaaah!

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:18.547
Aah!

01:10:24.678 --> 01:10:26.304
Come on, motherfucker!

01:10:45.157 --> 01:10:47.325
Yeah, that's my boy!

01:10:52.205 --> 01:10:54.499
Aah!

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:57.502
Oh! Aah!

01:10:57.711 --> 01:10:59.546
Aah! No!

01:11:49.262 --> 01:11:51.097
You OK, man?

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:52.599
Yeah, I'm good.

01:11:52.808 --> 01:11:55.227
You just make sure
you get this on camera.

01:14:01.519 --> 01:14:04.648
The Indianapolis Police
Department is on high alert

01:14:04.856 --> 01:14:07.400
as their manhunt
for three fugitives continues.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:10.445
Meanwhile, the death toll
continues to tick up.

01:14:10.654 --> 01:14:12.989
Steven Marra, Jeremy Phillips,
and Emma Harris

01:14:13.198 --> 01:14:17.160

I'm Jeremy Alan Phillips

I'm 24 years old,

01:14:38.139 --> 01:14:41.059
I solemnly swear that I did
not kill Officer Marcus Wilder
