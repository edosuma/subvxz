00:37.162 --> 00:38.121
<i>Hi, Delly.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:44.502
Looks like you got some sun.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.965
It's fun watching people's faces
when they see I'm alive.

00:48.965 --> 00:52.427
- I wonder if this is what Jesus felt like.
- Yeah, don't get used to it.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.013
I'm not letting a good funeral
go to waste.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.390
It should've been yours.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.565
- Where is he?
- Room four.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.567
- Look what he did to Benny.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.526
Is Delly with him?

01:08.526 --> 01:11.988
I don't know, but get him out of here.
You have to go too.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.532
I'm trying. I have been since I got here.

01:19.454 --> 01:23.249
<i>♪ My queen got machine gun hips
Better duck once they go off... ♪</i>

01:23.249 --> 01:26.836
- Okay, where's the gun? Was Moss in here?
- Maybe, yes.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.547
Pull the fire alarm.
I need to get him out of that room.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.007
- Not working.
- At the moment.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.301
- We have plans, improvements.
- Do you have a gun?

01:33.301 --> 01:34.552
- No.
- Yes.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.470
- Why?
- You do?

01:35.470 --> 01:38.306
Let me borrow it.
I'll give you another thousand.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.517
Follow me.

01:43.061 --> 01:46.147
Guns and money in the wall?
- That's a very big gun.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.399
You are like Scarface.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.193
There may be a smaller one
in lost and found.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.487
No, that's fine.
Just call the police. Get them here.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.030
- No.
- No police.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.366
- Why not?
We don't own the motel.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.575
What?
- We stole it.

01:57.575 --> 01:58.785
We didn't steal it.

01:58.785 --> 02:02.705
After the hurricane,
the owners went back to Ohio and left it.

02:02.705 --> 02:05.208
So we worked here, we had no place to go,

02:05.208 --> 02:08.419
we took the red tag off the door
and said it was ours.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.796
We plan to buy it.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.966
But with no immigration status,
we can't get a loan.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.301
Okay, no cops.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.599
I should've shot you when you were asleep,
when I had the chance.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.852
Wait, when?

02:23.852 --> 02:26.479
The night I found out
you killed my father.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.399
No, I didn't.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.025
Look at you.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.320
"No, I didn't push your father
off a fucking building."

02:34.320 --> 02:37.991
- I didn't know it was your father.
- The last name didn't ring any bells?

02:38.700 --> 02:39.701
Eventually!

02:39.701 --> 02:41.995
And when it did, you said nothing.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.080
'Cause I knew you'd act like this.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.167
How about you? You knew from the top.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.044
I thought you didn't do it.
I gave you the benefit.

02:50.044 --> 02:54.048
Shut the fuck up in there!
- Don't. Moss.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.142
Shh.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.440
- What the fuck, Iris?
- Get in the car.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.986
- Moss has Delly. She's in danger.
- Shut up.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.697
She's not in danger, you are. Listen.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.991
<i>I didn't know it was your father.</i>

03:21.868 --> 03:23.202
And I didn't kill you.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.714
But I wasn't gonna stick around either.

03:35.673 --> 03:39.719
Just didn't count on you
sending Mike after me like an animal.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.222
It's fine. I needed his help.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.891
<i>For what?</i>
<i>The gold.</i>

03:45.850 --> 03:47.101
<i>The pirate treasure?</i>

03:49.604 --> 03:50.688
It's real?

03:50.688 --> 03:52.440
Moss, it's so real.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.695
And after a few days, I cool off.
I always cool off, you know that.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.990
You do. That's true.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.327
And you wrote me that nice obituary.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.413
You saw that, huh?

04:08.957 --> 04:10.041
Yeah.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.921
But I couldn't contact you
because you killed Gil,

04:14.921 --> 04:16.756
so the cops were all over you.

04:16.756 --> 04:19.550
I didn't kill Gil. I had Jimmy do it.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.096
<i>You think I'd shove a guy down a sewer?
I take pride in my work.</i>

04:23.096 --> 04:27.308
- Which included killing my father.
- I realized that as I was saying it.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.601
<i>My bad.</i>

04:28.601 --> 04:29.519
Moss...

04:31.187 --> 04:34.524
We're talking about $100 million.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.985
Do you know what that kind of money means?

04:38.069 --> 04:41.155
Means you don't have to run
your dad's business anymore,

04:41.155 --> 04:42.323
live in his house,

04:42.323 --> 04:46.661
have people say, "You only have it all
because your dad gave it to you."

04:47.245 --> 04:50.039
- You can start your own thing.
- People say that?

04:50.623 --> 04:55.837
No more listening to your sister.
Sorry. I like Dori, but she's a bitch.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.178
So why'd you take the computer stick thing
out of my safe?

05:05.054 --> 05:06.014
Insurance.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.640
<i>In case you came after me.</i>

05:07.640 --> 05:10.601
<i>Okay. Now give it back.
- I don't have it.</i>

05:11.686 --> 05:13.771
I need that computer stick, though.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.860
- Did you come here for that or for me?
- I didn't know you weren't dead.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.862
I came to find out what Mike is up to.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.406
<i>And probably kill him,
which I'm getting to next.</i>

05:23.406 --> 05:25.199
<i>Well, don't.</i>

05:27.535 --> 05:28.369
Why?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.873
Because I don't know where the gold is.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.920
<i>You can't get him to tell you?</i>

05:37.920 --> 05:40.006
<i>What do you think
I've been doing down here?</i>

05:40.506 --> 05:43.301
<i>I am working this guy as hard as I can,</i>

05:43.301 --> 05:46.220
<i>and you show up at exactly the wrong time.</i>

05:47.305 --> 05:49.474
<i>I'm doing this for us, Moss.</i>

05:49.474 --> 05:50.516
<i>Just sit tight.</i>

05:52.769 --> 05:55.354
For us? Really?

05:55.354 --> 05:57.899
Yeah. Always.

05:59.358 --> 06:02.487
After tonight,
you can kill him all you want.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.462
When did you get a wire on her?

06:20.129 --> 06:21.756
- That's your question?
- Yes.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.758
- I'd have a lot of others.
- When?

06:24.550 --> 06:25.968
This morning at Sonny's.

06:25.968 --> 06:29.055
- So when we were talking at The Breakers--
- I knew about the gold.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.557
- And you just let me talk?
- Let you lie, you mean?

06:31.557 --> 06:33.643
The gold wasn't relevant to your inquiry.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.145
I can understand you
getting killed over a woman.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.440
- But a pirate treasure?
- I'm not getting myself killed.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.819
Do you need me to go back to where
she tells her boyfriend to murder you?

06:42.819 --> 06:45.822
The guy has a gun on her.
She'll say anything to stay alive.

06:45.822 --> 06:49.033
- I know she will.
- You heard, Moss killed her father.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.202
You think she'd be with the guy
after that?

06:51.202 --> 06:54.247
I don't know, maybe some women
stay longer than they should.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.594
Okay.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.933
- Let me make it right.
- How?

07:13.933 --> 07:18.396
You have him on tape connected to
Gil's murder and killing Delly's father.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.941
- But it's not admissible.
- I can use that to get a judge.

07:21.941 --> 07:25.695
You can't.
You're out of town. You bugged a citizen.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.907
That tape will get you in jail before him.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.953
Designate me as your authorized party.

07:34.662 --> 07:38.374
I'll get him on tape,
and I'll get you a confession you can use.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.587
If you're doing this as a grand gesture--

07:42.587 --> 07:46.632
No, I am the man you thought I was.
I'm not the man you think I am.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.308
I'm gonna need that back.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.153
We saw you.

08:12.658 --> 08:16.370
Drive up. We saw you drive up
and wanted to ask you a question.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.962
Tyler, there's more bags in the car.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.422
I just made toast.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.716
Can you get the bags, please?

08:33.304 --> 08:36.057
- Yeah, hey.
<i>Hey, Pats. Talk to your brother?</i>

08:36.057 --> 08:37.266
Not today.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.852
<i>I called him
to see if there's anything he can't eat.</i>

08:39.852 --> 08:45.107
<i>- Does he have a corn thing?</i>
- Deacon, maybe we do it another night.

08:45.107 --> 08:48.778
<i>No, we don't know when
we'll get another chance. Love you.</i>

08:48.778 --> 08:52.615
I ran into the neighbors.
They asked if you can babysit tonight.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.618
- I know it's last minute, so before--
- I'll do it.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.161
What?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.579
I'll do it. What time?

08:58.579 --> 09:00.915
- Um, six.
- Okay.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.209
Okay.

09:05.169 --> 09:08.631
Thirty-two down
is "ewer." E-W-E-R.

09:08.631 --> 09:12.093
You can read that upside down?
Oh, you're her.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.303
Kaitlin Fox, WFLG-TV.

09:14.303 --> 09:18.641
I know. You are very pretty.
My birth mother watches you every night.

09:19.559 --> 09:24.188
Lacey, I'm investigating a man
who's impersonating a federal employee

09:24.188 --> 09:27.066
and his cell records show him
to be in Coronado Beach.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.693
Okay, what's his name?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.987
He says it's Mike Valentine.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.530
Me!

09:33.781 --> 09:37.618
Me. Uh, it's me you need to talk
to about that.

09:37.618 --> 09:41.080
- It's fine, Andy. I got this.
- Lacey, I can handle this.

09:42.707 --> 09:43.541
Please.

09:51.882 --> 09:52.717
Feel that?

09:53.426 --> 09:54.677
That's nice.

09:56.053 --> 09:56.929
You hungry?

09:57.638 --> 09:59.974
You said you wanna
put your feet in the ocean.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.768
First, call Mike.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.520
Ask him to lunch.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.025
I wanna see his face
when he sees me walk in.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.654
Is that my car?

10:14.780 --> 10:15.615
It was.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.493
You need to take better care
of your things.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.672
- Dunney.
- It's Iris.

10:31.672 --> 10:35.384
<i>They put someone on Moss's man
Jimmy Gascoyne, like you said.</i>

10:35.384 --> 10:38.721
<i>- Meanwhile, guess who skipped town?</i>
- Moss Yankov. Yeah.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.682
He's down here, and I have someone
ready to wear a wire on him,

10:41.682 --> 10:43.559
<i>but I need the captain to authorize it.</i>

10:43.559 --> 10:45.811
Sure. What's the name?

10:47.730 --> 10:48.898
Mike Valentine.

10:50.107 --> 10:53.903
<i>Don't make it weird.
I'll keep my eye on him. Okay? I gotta go.</i>

10:54.570 --> 10:58.532
Hey. Here you go. I found a recorder.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.909
What brand is it?

10:59.909 --> 11:02.870
Did you get some generic one,
like you always do?

11:02.870 --> 11:05.122
Yeah. Why?

11:05.122 --> 11:06.874
To help me put Moss away?

11:06.874 --> 11:09.377
It is exactly the same as a name brand.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.961
I'm taking it back.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.428
Hey, what's up?

11:19.428 --> 11:21.347
<i>Hey, you wanna get some lunch?</i>

11:21.347 --> 11:23.516
Go over the plan for tonight?

11:26.102 --> 11:29.063
I could eat.
There's a place I've wanted to try.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.189
Sonny's.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.608
It's on the river. Wanna meet me there?

11:35.694 --> 11:37.196
Sonny's. I don't know it.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.864
<i>Yelp it. See you in 20.</i>

11:43.577 --> 11:45.538
Oh. Delly called.

11:46.664 --> 11:51.043
Moss doesn't want me to know he's here.
He wants to surprise me, the moron.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.336
You should have backup.

11:52.336 --> 11:56.048
It's okay. She's bringing him to my dad's.
Ray-Ray and Buzz will be there.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.343
I'll get his confession.
What else you got there?

11:59.343 --> 12:00.261
Batteries.

12:01.804 --> 12:05.266
So the centerpiece
in my investigation so far

12:05.266 --> 12:08.811
is how there's no record of that ambulance
being dispatched to the Bungalows.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.939
That license plate number,
that's the ambulance?

12:11.939 --> 12:15.776
Is the...? No, that's just
something Mike's dad asked me to run.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.778
I said I wouldn't, but now I am.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.321
Mike Valentine's dad?

12:19.822 --> 12:22.116
Sonny. He was police chief here.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.035
You're kidding.
This could be a family operation.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.495
I mean, could be.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.999
Sonny ran an "import" business
out of his place on the river.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.252
I knew it too,
and that's not something I'm proud of.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.462
Wait, wait, wait.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.798
Where on the river?

12:37.798 --> 12:40.468
Uh, he's right there.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.304
- And the ambulance depot is here.
- Very close.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.681
Oh, my God. Let's say it's drugs.

12:45.681 --> 12:49.143
You move them in on the river,
then you need some way to get them inland.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.896
What if there was a vehicle
with lots of cargo space?

12:51.896 --> 12:54.398
And could move fast
and never get pulled over, not once.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.733
- Officer Boone.
- Andy.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.862
We could be looking at a father-son
drug operation in Coronado Beach.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.948
Yeah, but Mike doesn't live here,
he lives in Philadelphia.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.659
How far does the Intracoastal Waterway go?

13:06.243 --> 13:08.621
- All the way up to Maine.
- Massachusetts.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.331
Do you know what this might be?

13:10.331 --> 13:13.501
A redemption story
for good old Andy Boone.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.253
Okay, but also the story of a cartel

13:16.253 --> 13:19.048
using rogue ambulance services
to move drugs

13:19.048 --> 13:22.259
into unsuspecting communities
up and down the Eastern Seaboard,

13:22.259 --> 13:25.930
reported by Kaitlin Fox,
CNN's new Washington correspondent.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.306
Or New York, I don't care.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.099
We should order lunch.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.730
All I need is Moss on tape,
connected to the murders.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.149
Iris will pick him up,
and we're clear for tonight.

13:37.149 --> 13:41.070
Don't you wonder why he showed up today,
the day of the job?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.489
I think because Dutch didn't check in,

13:43.489 --> 13:47.618
and not, as your tone is implying,
Delly calling him.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.412
But he doesn't need her alive.

13:51.038 --> 13:55.209
So if she walks in that door,
you have to wonder why.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.801
Hey, Moss.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.719
Want a beer?

14:06.303 --> 14:07.263
You told him?

14:07.263 --> 14:09.974
When would I do that?
I've been stuck to you.

14:09.974 --> 14:13.769
If you wanna sneak into town,
don't beat the shit out of my motel owner.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.564
Want a beer, yes or no?

14:17.314 --> 14:19.024
I thought there'd be a door.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.235
How can you make an entrance
without a door?

14:22.278 --> 14:26.031
Hey, pal. Two Coronas, please.
You want anything?

14:26.031 --> 14:28.534
Um, iced tea. Unsweetened.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.369
Do you have unsweetened tea?

14:31.954 --> 14:36.792
How about I make some tea
then neglect to sweeten it, sir?

14:37.334 --> 14:38.794
Great, thank you.

14:38.794 --> 14:39.712
This way.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.517
Got something for you.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.313
Went to a place to buy a shot glass,
and I saw this.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.064
Says your name on it.

15:01.108 --> 15:04.028
Anyway, why shouldn't I shoot you
in your fucking face right now?

15:04.028 --> 15:05.988
You'd get stuck with the check.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.073
You thought you were so fucking smart,

15:08.741 --> 15:10.492
lying to me that she was dead,

15:10.492 --> 15:13.037
causing me emotional distress.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.080
I grieved her.

15:17.333 --> 15:21.128
But I knew you were full of shit,
and now look at your dumb face.

15:21.128 --> 15:24.632
I didn't know I was lying to you.
She looked dead to me.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.217
- I did.
- I wanna hear him tell it.

15:27.217 --> 15:30.763
Then she showed up,
not dead, with a story about gold.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.391
So the second reason you should not put
a bullet in my dumb face

15:34.391 --> 15:36.685
is that I know where the gold is.

15:36.685 --> 15:40.064
And if she said that she does,
she's lying.

15:41.857 --> 15:42.816
She didn't.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.778
I'm Iris. You mind?

15:48.697 --> 15:50.366
Whoa, where you going?

15:50.366 --> 15:53.369
I gotta pee. Is that okay?
Order me some fries.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.121
You never eat fries.
- I'm stressed.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.599
Hey, detective.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.477
Fuck, fuck, fuck you.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.563
Shit.

16:32.449 --> 16:36.453
So now that we've established
a level of trust,

16:36.453 --> 16:38.205
why don't you say where this gold is

16:38.205 --> 16:40.499
and we could order fish sandwiches
and be friends?

16:40.499 --> 16:41.542
No.

16:41.542 --> 16:46.380
As eager as I am to see you flopping
over the side of Gil's boat in a wetsuit,

16:47.006 --> 16:49.675
telling you would undermine
my goal of staying alive.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.888
What's his boat got to do with it?

16:57.933 --> 17:02.604
A little known secret about shipwrecks
is that they're often found in the ocean.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.567
No, because Gil mentioned a truck.

17:09.778 --> 17:10.612
So what?

17:11.739 --> 17:12.823
Gamblers lie.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.118
Especially if they don't wanna be
chopped up by some amateur--

17:16.118 --> 17:18.412
Hey. Call me an amateur again...

17:18.412 --> 17:20.164
What else you want me to call it

17:20.164 --> 17:23.417
when the son of Bogo Yankov
makes such a careless mistake?

17:23.417 --> 17:26.128
Fuck you.
- Mike! There you are.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.882
I've been calling,
but I thought I'd come here...

17:29.882 --> 17:33.552
I saw your messages,
but I'm in the middle of something.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.972
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm Deacon, Mike's brother-in-law.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.394
Moss. Nice to meet you, Deacon.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.687
Oh!

17:43.687 --> 17:46.482
This is Delly. Delly, Deacon.

17:47.232 --> 17:50.027
So we're finishing up.
I will call you back.

17:50.027 --> 17:54.281
Sure, I just wanted to make sure
you remember about dinner tonight.

17:54.281 --> 17:58.494
Yeah, tonight, right.
No, it doesn't work anymore. I'm sorry.

17:58.494 --> 18:03.248
If you knew how excited your sister is
to have you and your dad together. Sonny!

18:03.248 --> 18:07.503
You're coming to dinner, right?
Patsy's really looking forward to it.

18:08.962 --> 18:13.717
So... this is your father.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.519
That's crazy.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.395
Did you know?

18:25.395 --> 18:26.313
No.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.233
Sorry, Deacon, can't make dinner.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.275
Sure, you can.

18:30.275 --> 18:34.863
- Hey, Deacon, is there room for us too?
- Of course. That would be great.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.281
No, that's rude, Moss.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.075
Deacon just said it's fine.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.869
Yeah, and we also have
this meeting after work.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.704
Plenty of time for both.

18:42.704 --> 18:46.959
Hey, Deacon, can I get your address?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.127
Absolutely.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.170
Can we bring anything?
Ah...

18:50.170 --> 18:52.506
Just yourselves. Any allergies?

18:53.090 --> 18:57.010
Mango, for some reason.
Otherwise, I'm like a goat.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.223
Okay, great. See you all around 6:00.

19:03.475 --> 19:07.229
Let's have those fries to go, Mike's dad.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.523
I wanna see the ocean.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.783
<i>♪ Baby child, I said a-right now ♪</i>

19:19.783 --> 19:21.535
<i>♪ Don't let a tear, don't let a tear ♪</i>

19:21.535 --> 19:24.454
<i>♪ Don't let a tear
Baby doll, I said ♪</i>

19:24.454 --> 19:28.041
<i>♪ Fall down a-from your eyes ♪</i>

20:15.172 --> 20:16.882
Really sorry. Really sorry.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.468
<i>Hey!</i>

20:19.468 --> 20:21.386
Ugh!
- Look at this.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.681
It's like a fucking dinosaur.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.266
Okay, put it down.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.060
- Hey.
Put it down!

20:28.936 --> 20:30.687
- Moss, put it down.
- Ah!

20:30.687 --> 20:32.397
He knows where Patsy lives.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.068
This is his last fucking day on Earth.

20:36.985 --> 20:40.072
He already thinks we're going out
on Gil's boat to get the gold.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.408
I'll get Ray-Ray and Buzz to meet us
when everybody's there.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.578
They'll take care of it.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.165
And then you and I
will go to the real place.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.335
Us and Delly.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.256
Let's see which way she breaks.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.054
And this just came in.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.017
You know that guy
that Sonny had me run a plate on?

21:09.017 --> 21:10.811
- Hmm?
- His name is Marvin Snyder.

21:10.811 --> 21:11.937
He goes by Dutch.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.357
He's got a rap sheet as long as my dinger,
and you know where he's from?

21:16.525 --> 21:17.609
Philadelphia.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.736
- Officer Boone.
- Just Andy.

21:19.736 --> 21:23.448
This is the smoking gun, some kind of
Philadelphia-Florida drug war.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.076
The ambulance driver
who could have exposed it is killed.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.453
And with the Department
of Transportation involved,

21:28.453 --> 21:32.457
that means the federal government
is running drugs on the highways.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.709
That's huge.

21:35.002 --> 21:38.338
Except Mike's not actually with
the Department of Transportation.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.965
Fuck!

21:39.965 --> 21:41.717
So we still got nothing.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.312
That's enough for television.

21:54.187 --> 21:57.190
<i>That Saturday game looks to be a doozy.</i>

21:57.190 --> 21:58.275
<i>Back to you, Kaitlin.</i>

21:58.275 --> 22:03.071
<i>An update to a recent Florida man story
that got a bit of attention from viewers.</i>

22:03.071 --> 22:05.824
<i>Authorities now believe the same man,</i>

22:05.824 --> 22:08.535
<i>pictured here
with the weapon he's known to carry,</i>

22:08.535 --> 22:14.333
<i>is involved in what may be a widespread
drug-running scheme using ambulances.</i>

22:14.333 --> 22:17.627
<i>Police say his last known whereabouts
were in Coronado Beach.</i>

22:17.627 --> 22:20.839
<i>Citizens there are cautioned
not to approach the man</i>

22:20.839 --> 22:23.425
<i>as he should be considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

22:23.425 --> 22:25.886
Son of a bitch. That's my gun.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.806
Hey, those are my shoes!

22:45.530 --> 22:48.450
Hey, put it away. Tyler's inside.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.243
Then Moss will be the only one armed.

22:50.827 --> 22:51.912
No, he won't.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.336
Did Iris know we were coming?

23:01.671 --> 23:03.006
She must be tracking Moss.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.491
Hey!

23:30.075 --> 23:31.576
Get over here.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.371
Keep your fucking shirt on.

23:36.373 --> 23:37.582
Nothing under there.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.085
Maybe she's tracking you.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.090
<i>Hi!</i>

23:46.007 --> 23:48.552
I know you said
don't bring anything, but here.

23:50.762 --> 23:51.930
This is for you.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.267
Where's Tyler?

23:55.267 --> 23:56.560
Babysitting.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.979
Michael, come help me with the drinks.

24:03.441 --> 24:04.276
Ice.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.195
Hey, I know I owe you a call.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.196
More than one.

24:10.699 --> 24:14.161
- How did it go at the hospital?
- Very well. All dead.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.248
<i>You okay?</i>

24:18.248 --> 24:19.541
I'm great.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.880
Is that man in there
the one that was gonna kill you?

24:25.630 --> 24:28.925
- Yeah.
- And you brought him into my home.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.220
I know, but it's okay.
We're just gonna eat and go.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.263
Uh-huh.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.850
And that's the woman
whose death you needed to pin on the EMT?

24:38.602 --> 24:39.436
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:40.312 --> 24:43.690
<i>I wish Tyler was here.
I bet she'd love seeing a zombie.</i>

24:44.316 --> 24:50.447
The trick is, do six minutes on one side,
and five on the other, not six.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.740
Mm-hm.

24:53.992 --> 24:57.078
So I'm gonna say a thing

24:57.996 --> 25:00.832
and your instincts
are gonna tell you to deny it,

25:01.791 --> 25:03.376
but fight that urge.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.046
I know you were fucking Delly.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.134
No, hold on, hold on. Don't lie.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.261
Because I did the math.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.765
Number one, look at her, right?

25:19.059 --> 25:23.146
But two, why was she
in your motel room today?

25:25.941 --> 25:28.568
She was looking
for something she left there.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.195
When?

25:31.404 --> 25:32.614
When you fucked her.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.660
You see that easy math?

25:40.413 --> 25:41.665
Hey, don't feel bad.

25:42.999 --> 25:45.752
You probably hesitated
before you went for it.

25:47.045 --> 25:47.879
How long?

25:50.090 --> 25:50.924
A minute?

25:52.801 --> 25:53.927
Maybe two?

25:57.931 --> 26:00.517
Enough to still see yourself
as a good guy.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.520
Morally upstanding.

26:05.981 --> 26:11.569
Because I've seen plenty
of upstanding guys, Mike.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.284
And I'll tell you something about them.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.874
They always end up
with no leg to stand on.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.092
I hope you didn't fall in love.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.472
She's good when she wants something.

26:40.515 --> 26:41.725
I'll give her that.

26:51.735 --> 26:54.029
Deacon, table's ready.

26:55.113 --> 26:58.825
Excuse me, Patsy.
Is there somewhere I might wash up?

26:59.326 --> 27:01.036
Yeah. Down the hall, to the right.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.174
- Hey, what was that about?
- Nothing. Just talking.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.259
- Okay.
- What?

27:16.259 --> 27:17.302
What's the plan?

27:18.428 --> 27:19.304
For?

27:19.304 --> 27:21.973
For tonight. Fuck. Jesus, for him.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.476
It's all good. I'm handling it.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.728
Oh, my God.
I'm so sick of that answer from you.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.439
Every time you say that,
a fucked-up situation is further fucked,

27:29.439 --> 27:32.400
and I'm more convinced I should never
have involved you in the first place.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.403
Thank your ex-wife
for the wire she planted.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.364
If Moss had found it, I'd be dead by now.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.617
If she hadn't planted it,
we both would be.

27:42.035 --> 27:45.163
How else would I have known
which lie we were telling?

27:48.041 --> 27:51.586
Sometimes it's hard to keep track,
you know.

28:05.475 --> 28:06.684
Hey, Andy.

28:07.644 --> 28:08.937
Hi, Lacey.

28:08.937 --> 28:12.774
Orlando PD got an ID on that guy
who blew up in the porta-potty.

28:12.774 --> 28:14.526
You're telling me this, why?

28:14.526 --> 28:18.321
It's the same guy as the tag number
that you told me to run this afternoon.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.614
Marvin Snyder.

28:20.490 --> 28:21.699
That's funny, huh?

28:30.708 --> 28:32.293
I'll take him out myself.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.753
You're not going on the boat.

28:35.004 --> 28:38.341
You're gonna take him there,
and then you're gonna leave.

28:38.341 --> 28:41.302
I still need to get him
confessing on tape for Iris, anyway.

28:42.011 --> 28:44.013
I care about two things right now,

28:44.013 --> 28:47.517
the clock ticking
on that hole getting cemented over

28:47.517 --> 28:52.230
and that asshole
not being on this Earth when it is.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.983
I have to take responsibility for this.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.736
Listen, I'm all about
your personal growth and development,

28:58.737 --> 29:00.905
but I got Buzz and Ray-Ray standing by.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.745
Then they can stand by
and watch me kill Moss.

29:09.038 --> 29:09.914
Let's eat.

29:18.006 --> 29:21.009
Everything looks so good, Patsy.

29:36.524 --> 29:39.110
Mm. Mm!

29:42.614 --> 29:43.698
To family.

29:43.698 --> 29:45.742
Huh? Yeah.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.874
See, this is what I miss, the family meal.

29:52.874 --> 29:55.168
Mine used to go around
and say what we did today.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.671
But it was just the three of us,
so that didn't take long.

29:58.671 --> 30:04.177
And when we adopted Dori, it was nice,
added someone to really talk to.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.137
And what did your father do?

30:06.971 --> 30:09.307
Mm! This is excellent corn.

30:09.307 --> 30:12.936
He was a businessman, Deacon.
What sort of business was he in?

30:12.936 --> 30:15.939
- This is good. Really sweet.
I noticed that.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.316
- Best corn we've had.
- It is, isn't it?

30:18.316 --> 30:21.152
Yeah. No, it's really, really good corn.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.948
Various businesses, Deacon.
He had his fingers in a lot of pies.

30:24.948 --> 30:28.117
I hear that. Still, it's nice
that he took time away for family.

30:28.117 --> 30:29.828
<i>You know, for Patsy and me,</i>

30:29.828 --> 30:33.039
even though God chose
to bless us with only one child,

30:33.039 --> 30:37.252
we do make sure to have dinner together
as a family every night, right?

30:37.752 --> 30:41.130
<i>We see communication
as the backbone of the family unit.</i>

30:41.130 --> 30:43.091
That was like us. That's what we did.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.843
Oh, my God. Are you fucking kidding me?

30:49.556 --> 30:52.016
I'm sorry, should we talk
about the corn some more,

30:52.016 --> 30:54.269
or does anybody in this house ever listen

30:54.269 --> 30:57.647
to the endless stream of bullshit
coming out of your mouths?

30:57.647 --> 30:59.399
Can all of you shut the fuck up

30:59.399 --> 31:01.693
for the love
of Jesus motherfucking Christ?!

31:04.112 --> 31:05.572
That feels good.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.201
Patsy?

31:10.201 --> 31:15.081
God chose not to bless us
with another child, Deacon?

31:15.081 --> 31:17.792
Because I thought it was the idiot doctor

31:17.792 --> 31:20.670
that delivered our first one
that scarred my uterus.

31:20.670 --> 31:24.966
Is that the same God whose plan it was
that I get knocked up in college,

31:24.966 --> 31:29.053
that Mama get cancer, and that
she blow her fucking head off over it?

31:29.053 --> 31:31.014
Because that God is a psycho.

31:33.766 --> 31:34.851
Look at you two.

31:36.102 --> 31:39.230
Of course, I knew Mama killed herself.
What did you think?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.482
There'd never be someone who knew someone

31:41.482 --> 31:44.944
whose kid would tell me
in front of the whole class?

31:45.528 --> 31:47.906
But I never said anything

31:48.489 --> 31:52.410
because you clearly didn't
wanna talk about it, so I never did,

31:53.536 --> 31:55.747
scared that what was left of us
would fall apart.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.540
But of course it did, anyway.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.584
And off you went.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.378
And you left me here, Michael,

32:02.378 --> 32:05.924
with a grieving man
who just wanted me not to need him.

32:06.674 --> 32:10.720
Now here you are, back,
with more lies, a gambler, and a thief,

32:10.720 --> 32:12.889
so that explains why
this guy is in our lives.

32:12.889 --> 32:16.267
- Patsy--
- I don't even care, Michael, really.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.603
I just did what you needed me to.
I killed a man.

32:18.603 --> 32:22.231
And I can't even feel that
because that's what we do.

32:22.231 --> 32:26.235
We just shove it down and down
and learn not to say the truth,

32:26.235 --> 32:29.280
and then not to feel it,
and then you don't feel anything at all.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.783
Everything sounds like
you're at the bottom of a pool,

32:31.783 --> 32:33.743
and you deny, deny, deny

32:33.743 --> 32:36.537
until denial is the only thing
holding us together.

32:36.537 --> 32:38.957
And so when the pressure gets too high,

32:38.957 --> 32:42.835
it collapses, like that
stupid sinkhole out there, and caves in.

32:42.835 --> 32:46.631
I just can't anymore
because I don't wanna end up like you two.

32:46.631 --> 32:50.051
I have to say what's going on,
so maybe it doesn't happen to my family.

32:50.051 --> 32:50.969
Patsy, stop.

32:50.969 --> 32:55.056
I had sex with the choir director
at that retreat in North Carolina.

33:02.563 --> 33:03.398
What?

33:04.482 --> 33:05.316
In a canoe.

33:06.609 --> 33:07.443
Mom?

33:09.445 --> 33:10.571
Tyler.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.703
Sure as shit getting a conure now.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.790
<i>You had her kill a man?</i>

33:20.790 --> 33:22.125
No, just make sure he died.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.377
- You involved your sister in this?
- Not in this.

33:24.377 --> 33:28.381
- Not in anything that concerns you.
- You concern me. A fucking lot.

33:29.132 --> 33:32.093
-"Thank you for a lovely evening"?
- It's polite.

33:32.093 --> 33:35.555
- You don't even hear yourself, do you?
- How does that even work in a canoe?

33:35.555 --> 33:38.307
- What?
- Hey. Let's go.

33:38.307 --> 33:39.892
