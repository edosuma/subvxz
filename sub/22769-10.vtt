there's a hairspray plant
nearby, too.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.540
I mean, well, you don't have to.

-Huh, never picked up on that.

02:13.750 --> 02:14.960
Basically a hidden message.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.750
Looks fun, Fred, but
I gotta work on something

02:17.750 --> 02:19.460
to deal with
our suiting-up problem.

02:22.170 --> 02:26.420
I'm busy too, Fred.
I'm reorganizing
my... organizer.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.670
Hard pass. No excuse.

02:30.670 --> 02:32.790
-No, come on, but--
-There's nothing anyone can say

02:32.790 --> 02:35.620
that can make me go
to a dopey game show.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.420
I would go, Freddy,
but I'm throwing
a sticker party.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.420
I'm in!
I can't do
another sticker party.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.170

-Did I happen to mention

02:53.170 --> 02:55.920
that our seats are
in the Maximum Insane
Gross Zone,

02:55.920 --> 02:58.290

Woman's voice:
Sushi limbo.

04:15.670 --> 04:18.290
How low can your sushi roll go?

04:18.290 --> 04:19.750
Dodge the chopsticks,

04:19.750 --> 04:22.000
and don't get dunked
in the soy sauce.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.120
Come on,
isn't this the best?

04:25.120 --> 04:27.670
-Hey!
-Ready...

04:27.670 --> 04:30.830
set... limbo!

04:30.830 --> 04:32.710
Huh! Aah!

04:34.790 --> 04:37.500
(grunts) Aah!

04:37.500 --> 04:39.500
-Ah!
-(splash)

04:40.830 --> 04:42.250
Ugh!

04:42.250 --> 04:44.330
You don't even
have to worry.
This is low sodium.

04:44.330 --> 04:46.250
Mr. Sparkles:
Here comes the loser hand!

04:46.250 --> 04:47.790
(baby crying)

04:47.790 --> 04:50.040
Uh-oh, sounds like
it's time to...

04:50.040 --> 04:52.670
Mr. Sparkles: Feed the baby!

04:52.670 --> 04:54.080
(cheering)

04:54.080 --> 04:56.790
Woman's voice:
Feed the baby.
Don your diaper

04:56.790 --> 04:58.790
and squirt the food
in the baby's mouth.

04:58.790 --> 05:01.620
But be careful.
He's not feeling well.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.120
And our lucky baby is...

05:05.790 --> 05:08.120
two-hundred and three!

05:08.120 --> 05:09.500
Go on, Go Go, feed the baby!

05:09.500 --> 05:13.040
Wait, it's "Feed the Baby"
but I have to wear the diaper?

05:13.040 --> 05:15.330
That's the maximum insane part!

05:15.330 --> 05:17.960
I'm not looking like an idiot
in front of millions of people.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.960
Don't worry about
what other people think, Go Go.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.540
-I mean, look at me!
-(crowd gasps)

05:21.540 --> 05:22.790
I came prepared
to be humiliated.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.290
It's fun!

05:24.290 --> 05:26.040
Maximum hard pass.

05:27.830 --> 05:29.670
-Hiro, why are we
in the middle of a field?
-(sneezes)

05:29.670 --> 05:33.500
(sneezes)
Uh, yeah.
(sneezes)

05:33.500 --> 05:35.620
The pollen levels
are killin' my sinuses.

05:35.620 --> 05:39.620
This is the best place
to demo the long range
capability of our new...

05:39.620 --> 05:40.960
suit delivery system!

05:40.960 --> 05:44.580
Ah-choo!
Sorry. (blows nose)

05:44.580 --> 05:46.880
Nasal spray can help relieve
your congestion.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.580
Uh... thanks, Baymax.
But I think I'm good.

05:50.580 --> 05:53.420
Right now, the suits
are at Fred's, on the other side
of the city.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.710
(beeping)

06:05.540 --> 06:06.540
(groans)

06:08.500 --> 06:09.790
(grunts) Huh.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.790
There appears to be an error.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.000
Sorry, guys.
Uh, the code checks out.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.920
I don't know why
that didn't work.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.790
Hiro, it's just a fluke.
Right, Wasabi?

06:19.790 --> 06:22.880
Totally.
Ah-ah-choo!

06:22.880 --> 06:25.420
Oh, I think I felt
something pop.

06:27.830 --> 06:30.040
Ugh... sticker party.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.670
Honey Lemon:
Go Go, come quick!

06:31.670 --> 06:34.710
You know how I posted
that video of Mochi
slow clapping?

06:34.710 --> 06:35.880
It's gone viral!

06:40.750 --> 06:42.420
-(shutters clicking)
-Oh! Hey!

06:42.420 --> 06:43.710

07:24.540 --> 07:26.830
Hang in there.
You're still a star!

07:26.830 --> 07:28.920
No matter how many
fair weather fans
unfollow you.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.120
Keep sparkling!

07:30.120 --> 07:31.210
(knock on door)

07:31.210 --> 07:32.920
-Uh, Mr. Sparkles?
-What is it?

07:32.920 --> 07:35.710
Can't you see
I'm giving myself
a creepy pep talk?

07:35.710 --> 07:39.330
Sorry, sir.
I just thought you'd wanna know
that Yaki Taco is no longer

07:39.330 --> 07:40.920
presenting us--
(flinching noise)

07:40.920 --> 07:42.750
They have to present us.
Who else would they present?

07:42.750 --> 07:44.420
Slow-Clap-Cat.

07:44.420 --> 07:47.330
He claps. Slowly.

07:47.330 --> 07:50.790
(growls)
No one can take away
Mr. Sparkles' sparkle.

07:50.790 --> 07:51.920
No one!

07:53.170 --> 07:56.290
I give you
suit delivery system 2.0.

07:56.290 --> 07:57.750
(beep)

08:07.500 --> 08:09.920
Whoa!
Very cool.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.830
Huh, that's weird.
The suits were supposed
to pop out.

08:12.830 --> 08:14.540
Something's not-- (groans)

08:15.540 --> 08:17.000
Why won't you work?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.790
(sighs, mutters)

08:18.790 --> 08:22.830
Okay. Well,
I'll leave you to it.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.420
(sighs)

08:25.420 --> 08:26.460
Huh?

08:28.750 --> 08:30.120
Aah!

08:30.120 --> 08:31.420
(screaming)

08:31.420 --> 08:32.880
Oh, no.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.500
Oh, no.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.750
(screaming)

08:38.460 --> 08:41.250
This could be
a medical emergency.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.000
(screaming)

08:46.790 --> 08:48.580
(gasping)

08:48.580 --> 08:52.170
You have a minor abrasion
on your left elbow.

08:52.170 --> 08:54.540
Sorry, Wasabi,
I-- I don't know
what's going on.

08:54.540 --> 08:56.960
Normally, my brain
just comes up with solutions,

08:56.960 --> 09:00.750
and, uh, well--
heh-- I guess it's just
not working lately.

09:00.750 --> 09:04.960
I didn't wanna alarm you
earlier, Hiro, but I think
you're experiencing

09:04.960 --> 09:09.750
what all scientists fear...
inventor's block!

09:12.080 --> 09:13.120
(groans)

09:14.620 --> 09:16.830
-On a scale of one to ten--
-Hiro: Seven!

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Ugh!
Not one idea all day.

09:29.290 --> 09:33.920
Ah! Wasabi's right.
I do have inventor's block.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.040
I will scan you now.

09:38.830 --> 09:41.380
Your condition
may be psychological.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.420
Perhaps you should
try... therapy.

09:43.420 --> 09:47.830
-Baymax, I don't think--
-Exercise one: Tell me,

09:47.830 --> 09:49.540
what was your childhood like?

09:49.540 --> 09:52.000
My childhood?
What does that have to do
with inventor's block?

09:52.000 --> 09:56.080
Early memories are key
to an in-depth analysis
of your... psyche.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.460
Is, uh, this gonna take long?

09:57.460 --> 09:59.960
Self-improvement
is a lifelong process.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.790
-Yeah, I need faster results.
-(tapping keyboard)

10:02.880 --> 10:04.420
We've made some real
breakthroughs.

10:04.420 --> 10:06.920
Let's pick up here next time.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.460
(whistling)

10:09.460 --> 10:12.080
Whoa, chief.
We're at capacity.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.750
Don't you know who I am?

10:13.750 --> 10:15.670
A guy with an overinflated
sense of self?

10:15.670 --> 10:17.210
I'm Mr. Sparkles!

10:17.210 --> 10:19.960
-Called it.
-Maximum Insane
Obstacle Challenge?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.880
Now you're just sayin' words.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.120
Look!
It's Slow-Clap-Cat!

10:28.120 --> 10:29.670
(shutters clicking)

10:29.670 --> 10:31.080
Oh, my.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.080
(purring)

10:32.080 --> 10:34.880
(sighs)
Oh, how I love that cat.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.040
Step aside, Spackles.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.620
-Do you mind?
-(chuckles) No, I don't.

10:39.620 --> 10:42.460
Oh, no, I meant,
do you mind moving
outta the way?

10:44.080 --> 10:46.290
See?
I could tell
you were a nobody.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.580
(quietly)
You think you're a smart
little kitty, don't you?

10:54.580 --> 10:57.120
Well, we'll see
who has the last clap.

10:58.210 --> 11:01.040
(whirs and buzzes)

11:01.040 --> 11:02.960
Ooh!

11:02.960 --> 11:04.250
You okay, Hiro?

11:04.250 --> 11:05.960
What if, I'm, uh,
all out of ideas?

11:05.960 --> 11:09.170
Wasabi!
What if I never get over
my inventor's block?

11:09.170 --> 11:10.830
When was the last time
you took a break?

11:10.830 --> 11:12.380
Break?
I don't do breaks.

11:12.380 --> 11:16.170
I've had some of my best ideas
when I wasn't trying.

11:16.170 --> 11:18.670
Breaks can lead
to breakthroughs.

11:18.670 --> 11:21.670
-(bells chime)
-Uh! There's my meditation
reminder now.

11:21.670 --> 11:23.210
-Care to join me?
-No, thanks.

11:23.210 --> 11:25.460
Come on, what do you have
to lose?

11:25.460 --> 11:28.120
You're not gonna stop
until I cave, are you?

11:28.120 --> 11:31.330
Close your eyes,
and imagine you're floating

11:31.330 --> 11:35.420
on a soft, fluffy
white cloud.

11:35.420 --> 11:39.210
Feel the surface beneath you
begin to rise, as you float

11:39.210 --> 11:41.790
into the clear blue sky.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.080
-(tapping keyboard)
-Wait! What are you doing?

11:49.080 --> 11:51.960
I'm brainstorming
some new suit delivery ideas.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.170
-But that's not the point of--
-Goodbye, Wasabi cloud.

11:54.170 --> 11:57.880
-I'm just gonna try
to work through this.
-(slapping)

11:59.460 --> 12:02.040
Slow-Clap-Cat has become
the most viewed video ever.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.120
Tell me, how does it feel?

12:04.120 --> 12:06.540
Well... um,
pretty darn exciting.

12:06.540 --> 12:08.290
Pretty darn exciting.

12:08.290 --> 12:09.580
(quietly)
Powerful words.

12:09.580 --> 12:10.670
Stay with us.

12:10.670 --> 12:12.040
Woman's voice:
And we're clear!

12:12.040 --> 12:14.500
Thanks for having me
on your show, Mr. Dunder.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.710
Please.
My dad's Mr. Dunder.

12:16.710 --> 12:19.080
-Autograph?
-Oh, that's okay.
I think I'm good.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.920
-No, really.
Not a problem.
-(meows)

12:20.920 --> 12:24.080
-"To Slow Clap..."
-(meows)

12:24.080 --> 12:26.830
-Guys, look!
-Hello, world!
Mr. Sparkles here.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.170
You might remember me
from my old internet
game show

12:29.170 --> 12:31.380
"Maximum Insane
Obstacle Challenge."

12:31.380 --> 12:35.120
Well, today, I start
a new show: "Totally Lethal

12:35.120 --> 12:37.120
Unfair Obstacle Challenge",

12:37.120 --> 12:39.750
where the stakes
are out of this world!

12:39.750 --> 12:40.880
(meows)

12:40.880 --> 12:41.920
Mochi!

12:41.920 --> 12:43.330
It's my most insane
challenge ever.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.710
If someone can beat it
in the next hour,

12:45.710 --> 12:48.290
Slow-Clap-Cat goes free!

12:48.290 --> 12:51.710
But if not, I'll just have
to turn this internet star

12:51.710 --> 12:57.120
into a real star.
By sending him
to space!

13:02.790 --> 13:04.960
-Poor Mochi!
-We've got an hour.
We can save him!

13:04.960 --> 13:08.120
-Hiro! We need our suits.
-I know! Hold on!
Voice integrated command.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.210
VIC... yeah, I like that.

13:10.210 --> 13:12.380
Bring our suits
to Lucky Cat Cafe.

13:12.380 --> 13:14.750
Robotic voice:
Okay, Hiro, I will bring
your suits

13:14.750 --> 13:16.380
to the middle of the ocean.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.250
VIC, come on!
You're embarrassing yourself,

13:19.250 --> 13:21.210
that's not even remotely close
to what he said.

13:21.210 --> 13:25.040
-Lucky Cat Cafe!
-The Ocean! Middle
of the ocean!

13:25.040 --> 13:26.210
Seriously, VIC?

13:29.580 --> 13:32.250
-Please tell me
we have backup suits.
-We do not.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.580
-Unbelievable.
-Mochi's missing.

13:34.580 --> 13:35.830
I have to hang up
these fliers.

13:35.830 --> 13:37.330
Baymax, you go with Aunt Cass.

13:37.330 --> 13:40.330
Don't let her find out
Mr. Sparkles has Mochi.

13:40.330 --> 13:45.080
-She's already upset.
-I will protect Aunt Cass
from further emotional trauma.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.880
Baymax, you go with Aunt Cass.
We'll start searching.

13:47.880 --> 13:51.710
Yeah, we'll give it
our "maximum" effort.

13:51.710 --> 13:56.210
-Are you okay, Fred?
-Yeah, I'm fine, I just
have a "sparkle" in my eye.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.250
You guys see what I'm doin'?

13:57.250 --> 13:59.040
-You guys notice?
-Knock it off.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.580
-Ohh!
-Come on, Baymax.

14:00.580 --> 14:02.710
You guys go to the studio.
Buy me some time.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.210
But what about Mochi?

14:04.210 --> 14:06.790
I know what to do.
And I know how to do it.

14:06.790 --> 14:10.380
-Ahh!
-Sprinkles has the whole place
booby-trapped!

14:10.380 --> 14:12.210
Police dispatcher:
Stand by and wait for back-up.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.210
(siren blares)

14:14.710 --> 14:16.500
Fred: Wow!

14:16.500 --> 14:18.170
Why don't we just ambush him
and grab Mochi?

14:18.170 --> 14:20.710
Because he's booby-trapped
the whole set!

14:20.710 --> 14:22.330
The only way
to save Mochi

14:22.330 --> 14:24.330
is to complete
his insane challenge!

14:24.330 --> 14:27.000
Totally Lethal Unfair
Obstacle Challenge!
Keep up!

14:27.000 --> 14:29.210
(beeping)

14:29.210 --> 14:30.880
Woman's voice:
Scream of broccoli.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.250
Mr. Sparkles:
To save the cat,
put on the broccoli suit

14:33.250 --> 14:35.830
and clear the Pot
of Fon-doom!

14:35.830 --> 14:39.210
Then face
the Veggie Cruel-dites!

14:39.210 --> 14:42.420
Cruel-dites?
What is he even
talking about?

14:42.420 --> 14:44.170
My destiny!

14:44.170 --> 14:45.880
-Ready?
-Born ready!

14:45.880 --> 14:47.250
-Set?
-Born set!

14:47.250 --> 14:50.880
-Go!
-Born go! Ahh!

14:50.880 --> 14:52.420
Ah! Whoa!

14:56.250 --> 15:01.880
Aww, feta luck next time!
Feta is a type of cheese.
Never stop learning!

15:01.880 --> 15:03.170
(tapping keyboard)

15:08.000 --> 15:10.380
Hang on, Mochi.

15:10.380 --> 15:13.380
Uhh... this isn't vegan
by any chance, is it?

15:13.380 --> 15:14.960
I'm trying to watch my dairy.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.500
Sorry!

15:17.540 --> 15:19.250
(groans)

15:19.250 --> 15:20.210
Whoo!

15:20.210 --> 15:22.290
Ooh! (grunting)

15:22.290 --> 15:23.540
-Nice! Way to
use your core!
-Woo-hoo!

15:23.540 --> 15:24.580
Come on, Wasabi!

15:24.580 --> 15:25.920
Boring!

15:25.920 --> 15:28.750
-(grunts)
-Mr. Sparkles:
Broccoli loves company!

15:28.750 --> 15:29.830
Wah-ah! Hey!

15:29.830 --> 15:32.040
Aah! Ooh!
Huh?

15:32.040 --> 15:34.790
Mr. Sparkles:
And now this is happening!

15:34.790 --> 15:37.500
(screams) Aah!

15:37.500 --> 15:40.500
Ah! These tomatoes are overripe!

15:40.500 --> 15:44.420
-Gross! Whoa!
-Meanwhile, back
at the ranch dressing!

15:44.420 --> 15:47.330
Looks like he got dealt
a bad... hand.

15:47.330 --> 15:49.790
I'm guessing this isn't
vegan, either.

15:49.790 --> 15:51.250
No. It is.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.960
I hope Mochi turns up
soon, Baymax.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.620
If something happened
to him, I'd-- I'd fall
to pieces.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.620
Are-- Are you okay, Baymax?

15:59.620 --> 16:02.080
Yes, Aunt Cass.
Are you?

16:03.080 --> 16:05.210
How about a warm hug?

16:05.210 --> 16:06.830
Aww, thanks!

16:10.880 --> 16:12.920
Wasabi:
Yeah! All right!

16:12.920 --> 16:15.330
Ooh! (grunts)

16:15.330 --> 16:16.960
I love that body control!

16:16.960 --> 16:18.000
You got it,
Honey Lemon!

16:18.000 --> 16:19.920
Ohh! You guys are too sweet!

16:19.920 --> 16:23.080
Here comes the unfair part.
Like when a cat steals
your sparkle!

16:23.080 --> 16:24.330
Ahh!

16:24.330 --> 16:26.380
(video game noises)

16:27.580 --> 16:31.500
Oh, it looks like
we only have time
for one more unlucky contestant!

16:31.500 --> 16:34.330
-Great.
Time to look like an idiot.
-(cracking noises)

16:34.330 --> 16:38.170
Go Go, you're going out
an idiot, but comin' back
a winner.

16:38.170 --> 16:39.380
Who looks like an idiot.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.330
-Mr. Sparkles:
Smile, you're on loser cam!
-(laughter)

16:43.330 --> 16:45.120
Oh, that's not nice!

16:47.000 --> 16:49.170
Yeah!
Way to go, broccoli!

16:49.170 --> 16:51.460
Yes, way to go, broccoli!

16:51.460 --> 16:53.120
Way to go down!

16:53.120 --> 16:54.420
Aah!

16:54.420 --> 16:56.040
(grunts)

16:58.290 --> 16:59.380
Aah!

16:59.380 --> 17:00.920
Wasabi:
Broccoli! Broccoli! Broccoli!

17:00.920 --> 17:02.750
Fred:
Body control! All right!

17:03.920 --> 17:04.920
(grunts)

17:10.460 --> 17:14.000
Wasabi:
Broccoli! Broccoli! Broccoli!
Broccoli! Broccoli! Broccoli!

17:14.000 --> 17:16.380
Stop cheering!
There's still the most
dangerous obstacle

17:16.380 --> 17:17.580
I've ever designed!

17:19.540 --> 17:20.750
Whoa! Aah!

17:20.750 --> 17:22.960
Mr. Sparkles:
Dun-dun-duh!

17:25.420 --> 17:27.750
-The blender--
-Woman's voice:
The blender of affliction!

17:27.750 --> 17:29.830
Mother, I thought
I was gonna say that!

17:29.830 --> 17:34.500
Broccoli in a tropical smoothie?
Who would do such a thing?

17:34.500 --> 17:36.000
Me.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.710
Hey, that's not fair!

17:37.710 --> 17:39.920
Unfair and lethal,
it's in the name!

17:39.920 --> 17:40.960
One minute left.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.040
(grunts)

17:45.040 --> 17:47.580
(grunting)

17:50.380 --> 17:51.380
(gasp)

17:52.420 --> 17:54.290
We will find Mochi.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.790
Who doesn't like watermelon?
It's refreshing!

18:02.790 --> 18:04.290
Whoa! (groans)

18:05.540 --> 18:06.380
(grunts)

18:06.380 --> 18:08.210
Uh-oh! Look out below!

18:08.210 --> 18:11.330
It's not a party
without pineapples!

18:12.920 --> 18:14.540
(grunts, gasps)

18:17.170 --> 18:18.500
Aah!

18:19.790 --> 18:20.880
Aah!

18:20.880 --> 18:21.960
(gasps)

18:21.960 --> 18:24.000
Mr. Sparkles:
This is gonna
get messy!

18:27.460 --> 18:29.460
(grunting)

18:31.290 --> 18:33.080
This is so stupid!

18:33.080 --> 18:34.420
(gasps)

18:35.710 --> 18:37.040
(buzzer)

18:38.460 --> 18:39.330
(cheering)

18:42.170 --> 18:43.710
I beat your dumb game.

18:43.710 --> 18:45.540
Now give me the cat.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.420
Well,
that was the deal.

18:47.420 --> 18:48.540
Nah!

18:48.540 --> 18:49.540
(beep)

18:52.250 --> 18:53.250
Mochi!

18:55.210 --> 19:00.460
Thanks for watching, everyone!
Till next time, never give up
on your dreams!

19:00.460 --> 19:03.080
(bocking noise)

19:06.290 --> 19:08.120
Oh, no, he's gone!

19:08.120 --> 19:10.330
I don't think so.

19:10.330 --> 19:12.500
(beeps)

19:18.380 --> 19:19.380
(startled noise)

19:26.960 --> 19:30.080
(beeping)

19:39.250 --> 19:40.920
(beeping)

20:11.210 --> 20:13.420
-Mochi!
-(meows)

20:13.420 --> 20:14.540
(meows)

20:15.960 --> 20:17.210
Yes!

20:17.210 --> 20:18.920
Oh! It worked!

20:25.580 --> 20:27.580
Ugh!

20:27.580 --> 20:29.040
Ohh, thanks, guys.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.380
Ugh! (gagging noise)

20:36.500 --> 20:38.040
Guys!
Check it out!

20:38.040 --> 20:40.540
"Slow-Clap-Cat Reunites
with Owner" has become
the viewed video ever!

20:42.620 --> 20:44.670
Oh, I missed you,
too, Mochi.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.750
(meows and purrs)

20:48.170 --> 20:50.620
So, Hiro, how did you get over
your inventor's block?

20:50.620 --> 20:54.540
When I saw Mochi in trouble,
I guess I forgot I was blocked
in the first place.

20:54.540 --> 20:55.710
It focused me.

20:55.710 --> 20:57.500
Bump the cloud.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.670
And that idea
led me to something else.

20:59.670 --> 21:01.460
I have something
to show you guys.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.250
I re-purposed Skymax to be
our new suit delivery system.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.380
Skymax?
Who's Skymax?

21:08.380 --> 21:09.380
He is.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.040
Whoa!
Nice to meet you, Skymax.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.670
Hey, I don't suppose
you also clean the suits?

21:19.670 --> 21:21.380
'Cause mine's getting
a little funky.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.710
Robotic voice:
Eh-eh-eh-no.

21:22.710 --> 21:23.580
Fair enough.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.710
Mr. Sparkles:
Ten million views!

21:26.710 --> 21:27.960
I'm more famous than ever!

21:27.960 --> 21:29.750
Everyone wants the sparkle!

21:29.750 --> 21:31.710
(insane laugh)

21:37.040 --> 21:39.750
(theme music playing)
