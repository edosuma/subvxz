00:02.437 --> 00:08.051
[Jughead] The year is 1955,
and nothing like this had ever
happened in Riverdale.

00:08.095 --> 00:11.402
One of our own, Ethel Muggs,
had stumbled
into the sock hop,

00:11.446 --> 00:14.710
covered in,
we would soon find out,
her parents' blood.

00:14.753 --> 00:17.669
Both were dead,
stabbed multiple times.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.326
[door opens]

00:23.110 --> 00:24.198
[Alice] Oh...

00:24.241 --> 00:25.721
What did Ethel say?

00:25.764 --> 00:26.983
Did she see the killer?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.637
Well,
your friend's keeping mum,

00:28.680 --> 00:30.465
but she claims

00:30.508 --> 00:33.294
that the milkman
killed her parents.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.471
Willie?

00:36.514 --> 00:38.690
He's 70 years old. [scoffs]

00:38.734 --> 00:40.170
He is.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.563
Well, are you going to bring
him in for questioning?

00:41.606 --> 00:44.218
It's late and Willie could use
his rest,

00:44.261 --> 00:46.133
so we'll, uh...
We'll talk to him tomorrow

00:46.176 --> 00:47.743
after he's done
his morning deliveries.

00:48.744 --> 00:51.529
It's tragic, yes.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.488
But why bring her here, Alice?

00:53.531 --> 00:55.664
She has nowhere else
to go, Hal.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.580
Her parents are dead.

00:58.623 --> 01:02.018
It's the least
we can do for her,
don't you think?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.454
Think how this
will affect Betty.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.587
That's all I ever think about,

01:05.630 --> 01:07.415
is the well-being
of this family.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.418
Which is more
than I can say for you.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.289
[sighs]

01:18.600 --> 01:21.646
We're gonna make up
my sister's old room for you.

01:23.648 --> 01:26.129
Here are some fresh towels.

01:26.173 --> 01:29.567
If you need anything
at any point,
just come find me.

01:29.611 --> 01:30.525
Okay?

01:33.267 --> 01:35.616
I don't know what else
they want me to say.

01:35.660 --> 01:36.574
[sniffles]

01:40.012 --> 01:43.712
It's...
It's almost like they think
that maybe I...

01:43.755 --> 01:45.670
Ethel, is there anyone
who saw you

01:45.714 --> 01:47.324
before you went back
to your house?

01:48.934 --> 01:51.807
Anyone who could be an alibi?

01:54.505 --> 01:55.463
No.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.509
No, I was alone.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.688
I'm so sorry
that this happened to you.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.822
Please try to rest, okay?

02:11.914 --> 02:12.828
We're here for you.

02:15.352 --> 02:17.180
Whatever you need.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.791
[Jughead]
But Betty's entreaties
did little to comfort Ethel,

02:19.835 --> 02:22.272
who didn't say another word
that night.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.622
Which only added
to the mystery.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.363
Is Ethel hiding something?

02:26.407 --> 02:29.497
And why did her milkman story
sound so familiar to me?

02:32.935 --> 02:37.200

It is high time that you got
yourself a boyfriend, Cheryl.

02:56.524 --> 02:59.048
Mother,
I don't have time for boys.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.398
-I'm far too busy.
-Doing what?

03:01.442 --> 03:03.705
-Painting naked ladies?
-Mother!

03:03.748 --> 03:06.273
What nerve?
That's homework for art class!

03:08.144 --> 03:09.841
You could help, you know?

03:09.885 --> 03:13.671
Isn't there some
nice, normal boy
you could introduce her to?

03:15.020 --> 03:17.414
I'm just worried she's, uh...

03:17.458 --> 03:21.288
developing unnatural
proclivities, shall we say?

03:21.331 --> 03:23.377
What are you talking about,
Mom?

03:23.420 --> 03:27.946
Find your sister
a suitable match, immediately.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.513
Do I make myself clear?

03:37.608 --> 03:39.915
That was quite the scene
at the sock hop.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.744
Do you know that poor girl?

03:42.787 --> 03:43.875
Not really.

03:43.918 --> 03:45.225
I mean, she's Ethel.
She kind of...

03:45.268 --> 03:47.618
She kind of keeps to herself.

03:47.662 --> 03:52.797
Well, not to pivot
gracelessly, but...

03:52.841 --> 03:56.410
Listen, Archie,
I'm really sorry
we got off on the wrong foot.

03:57.585 --> 04:00.022
Could we maybe try again?

04:02.503 --> 04:04.461
I... I really appreciate
the apology.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.812
Look, the truth is, Veronica,

04:07.856 --> 04:10.162
I just... I don't think
we're a good match.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.513
I mean, you're too much
of a handful for a guy like me.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.129
[sighs]

04:20.172 --> 04:21.957
What happened
to the Muggs family
is a tragedy.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.569
It's all the children
are talking about.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.832
The parents are calling.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.488
Asking how we plan
to address this situation.

04:31.532 --> 04:35.579
Well, I believe the most
prudent course of action
is to simply carry on

04:35.623 --> 04:38.103
with the week's
preapproved lesson plans.

04:38.147 --> 04:38.974
Yes!

04:40.497 --> 04:43.326
What's on the docket
this week, Ms. Bell?

04:43.370 --> 04:46.198
Well, in fact,
the juniors are scheduled

04:46.242 --> 04:50.594
to have their PTA-approved
sexual education lecture.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.509
But we could postpone it.

04:52.553 --> 04:56.252
On the contrary,
I will give the lecture myself.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.429
Splendid idea, Dr. Werthers.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.779
Business as usual.

05:02.998 --> 05:03.912
That's the ticket.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.008
Tough luck
about Veronica, chum.

05:13.051 --> 05:15.010
I guess it wasn't in the cards
for you two.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.056
Yeah, I guess not.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.797
It's probably for the best.

05:19.841 --> 05:23.061
I mean,
girls like Veronica run hot
and cold

05:23.105 --> 05:26.500
and it takes
a certain kind of man
to ride that roller-coaster.

05:26.543 --> 05:29.024
-A man like you, I'm guessing?
-Pretty much.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.505
But if you're hankering
for a steady girlfriend,

05:31.548 --> 05:32.897
Cheryl's available.

05:32.941 --> 05:33.898
Cheryl?

05:36.074 --> 05:38.076
Thanks, but no thanks.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.339
Why not?

05:39.382 --> 05:40.862
You don't think my sister
is a honey?

05:40.905 --> 05:43.560
[scoffs] No, I mean,
come on, Chery's gorgeous.

05:45.301 --> 05:46.824
-But...
-But what?

05:46.868 --> 05:49.697
Well, she's always seemed
a little standoffish to me.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.960
I mean, I've never seen her
with a steady boyfriend
or anything.

05:52.003 --> 05:55.659
She's had boyfriends.
College guys, mostly.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.966
You know what they say
about girls who
like older men, right?

05:59.446 --> 06:00.534
No, what...

06:01.404 --> 06:03.058
What do they say?

06:03.101 --> 06:04.538
They're a lot more...

06:06.104 --> 06:09.499
open-minded than most
high school girls

06:09.543 --> 06:11.371
if you catch my drift.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.416
You take Cheryl out,

06:13.460 --> 06:14.983
you're made in the shade,
daddio.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.421
Something tells me she'd...

06:18.465 --> 06:20.380
really go for a stud like you.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.511
[chuckles]

a little performance
at the Dark Room tonight.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.461

it might razz your berries.

there for you, right?

I'm not so sure
about that, Lizzo.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.785
What's your problem,
Topaz?

07:18.699 --> 07:20.614
Am I too much woman
for you?

07:20.657 --> 07:22.572
My problem with you

07:22.616 --> 07:25.183
is that you're
a high school dropout
and you're too territorial.

07:26.358 --> 07:27.707
But I'll see you
at the Dark Room.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.623
And what makes you think
I'm going?

07:29.666 --> 07:31.581

you're avoiding someone.

egregiously overrated.

I might relent.

-Hmm.

13:42.299 --> 13:46.564
[Jughead] Here is why Ethel's
milkman story
sounded so familiar.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.524
It reminded me of a comic book
Pep had published.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.656
One of
their most infamous issues,

13:51.700 --> 13:54.616
about a lunatic who escapes
from an insane asylum,

13:54.659 --> 13:56.618

13:56.661 --> 13:58.228
and starts murdering people.

13:58.272 --> 13:59.839
Ethel and I had both read it.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.145
Then again, everyone had.

14:02.189 --> 14:04.626
I'm sure it was a coincidence.
It had to be.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.715
But it wouldn't
look good for Ethel

14:06.758 --> 14:08.456
to be caught with it,
no matter what.

14:12.503 --> 14:15.942
And to the republic

It doesn't need
to mean anything.

20:45.809 --> 20:49.378
let's begin
with a very useful diagram.

20:59.693 --> 21:03.784
Much can be gleaned
from the typical
American flower,

21:03.827 --> 21:07.135
whose sole function,
with its colorful petals

21:07.178 --> 21:12.749
and its pleasing contour,
is pollination
or reproduction.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.536
I'm so confused.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.842
What do flowers and bees
have to do with us?

21:18.886 --> 21:21.323
Nothing. I don't know
what that speech was about.

21:21.367 --> 21:25.719
But recently I got my hands
on a copy of Kingsley's Guide
to Human Sexuality.
