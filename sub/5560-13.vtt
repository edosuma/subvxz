(announcer) Previously, on "Blindspot"...

00:02.778 --> 00:04.685
(groaning)

00:04.753 --> 00:07.372
Chief Inspector Fischer.
This can't be good.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.639
I'm opening an inquiry into
the death of David Wagner.

00:09.707 --> 00:12.187
You're never gonna be the head of the NYO.

00:12.255 --> 00:14.700
You think I don't know you've
been campaigning internally?

00:14.768 --> 00:18.502
When was the first time you removed
classified documents from the FBI's office?

00:18.570 --> 00:20.886
And were you aware at the time
that you were breaking federal law?

00:20.954 --> 00:23.890
Patterson is a good agent. She stays.

00:23.958 --> 00:27.224
This is Agent Sloane. She's
going to be assisting us.

00:27.292 --> 00:30.502
Olivia Delidio, Russian-born,
married to an American for 12 years.

00:30.570 --> 00:33.777
You'll be charged with espionage,
treason, accessory to murder,

00:33.845 --> 00:35.950
thrown in prison for the rest
of your life, if you're lucky.

00:36.018 --> 00:37.128
What are your orders?

00:37.196 --> 00:39.245
We were given targets, people to kill.

00:39.313 --> 00:40.818
- Hey, Allie.
- Hello, Kurt.

00:40.886 --> 00:41.824
You're a marshal now?

00:41.892 --> 00:43.921
Yeah, I was looking for a change.

00:43.989 --> 00:46.029
I'm going to untie you.
I'm here to help you.

00:46.097 --> 00:48.031
- I want answers.
- Your colleagues, they're into

00:48.099 --> 00:50.461
- some very terrible things.
- They are my friends.

00:50.528 --> 00:52.474
They're scared of you, and they should be.

00:52.542 --> 00:53.684
I have missions for you.

00:53.752 --> 00:55.896
Things that move us
closer to our objectives.

00:55.964 --> 00:57.617
You show me you can be trusted, and I'll...

00:57.685 --> 00:59.981
tell you everything you want to know.

01:04.384 --> 01:05.687
(Jane) What is Orion?

01:05.755 --> 01:08.771
Orion is where you died.

01:08.839 --> 01:10.180
It was an operation.

01:10.248 --> 01:12.377
Things went sideways,
you went off the grid.

01:12.445 --> 01:14.173
I don't understand.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.972
Orion is why you're here.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.123
Why we're all here.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.466
But I can't tell you more.

01:20.534 --> 01:22.001
Not yet.

01:26.113 --> 01:27.847
You can't trust them.

01:30.463 --> 01:33.337
They trust you, so I trust you.

01:33.405 --> 01:35.638
<i>You did this to yourself.</i>

01:36.495 --> 01:38.680

01:53.535 --> 01:55.270
Hmm.

01:55.678 --> 01:57.294
Walk of Shame, huh?

01:57.498 --> 01:59.314
Who said I'm ashamed?

01:59.491 --> 02:01.865
Why haven't I met this guy?

02:02.129 --> 02:03.616
Since when do you care who I'm dating?

02:03.684 --> 02:05.677
Since you started keeping it a secret.

02:05.745 --> 02:07.138
How was Dad last night?

02:07.206 --> 02:08.439
He was all right.

02:09.026 --> 02:10.808
He's a bit bothered by the cancer meds.

02:10.875 --> 02:12.968
Yeah.

02:13.036 --> 02:15.779
Well, just glad you guys are talking again.

02:15.868 --> 02:17.704
- Yeah.
- And all it took was a terminal illness

02:17.772 --> 02:18.779
and the return of a murdered girl

02:18.847 --> 02:21.575
to bring the Weller
family back together again.

02:21.950 --> 02:24.069
That's not funny.

02:24.218 --> 02:26.587
Yeah... I mean, it's a little funny.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.564
I think it's funny.

02:45.877 --> 02:49.099
An innocent man is dead.

02:49.167 --> 02:51.376
Because of your actions.

02:57.479 --> 02:58.676
Hey.

02:59.707 --> 03:01.196
Are you feeling okay?

03:01.264 --> 03:03.559
Yeah, fine. Uhh!

03:03.627 --> 03:04.769
This wouldn't have anything to do with

03:04.837 --> 03:07.175
that Russian spy's final
arraignment today, would it?

03:07.243 --> 03:08.747
(Zapata) Are you sure
you want to be here today?

03:08.815 --> 03:10.431
Nobody would fault you, if you want...

03:10.499 --> 03:14.171
I just want to get past all this David...

03:14.586 --> 03:16.081
I... I just want things

03:16.149 --> 03:18.308
to go back to the way that they were.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.825
I appreciate your concern.

03:26.138 --> 03:28.160
How did you not work this out before?

03:28.228 --> 03:29.371
This is the first I'm hearing of this,

03:29.439 --> 03:31.315
- Your Honor.
- Well, it shouldn't be.

03:31.383 --> 03:33.364
If your client truly has that name,

03:33.432 --> 03:35.867
it is vital to national security.

03:35.935 --> 03:37.322
- I know an...
- We'll need a deal on the table

03:37.390 --> 03:39.681
before my client says anything further.

03:39.831 --> 03:41.798
You've got 15 minutes.

03:41.866 --> 03:43.590
Make it happen.

03:45.704 --> 03:47.491
What the hell was that?

03:47.559 --> 03:49.629
I'm your attorney, you
blindside me with this?

03:49.697 --> 03:50.590
Bluffing is not going to get you...

03:50.658 --> 03:52.276
It's not a bluff.

03:52.489 --> 03:55.483
I couldn't risk the name getting
out before I saw the judge.

03:55.551 --> 03:57.214
You really have a name?

03:57.331 --> 03:59.363
Yes, on my children's lives,

03:59.431 --> 04:02.052
I swear to you, I have the name.

04:02.344 --> 04:05.008
Do you think this could buy me a way out?

04:05.224 --> 04:07.324
Yeah.

04:07.532 --> 04:08.832
I think it might.

This video. Look at that.

Sarah sent it to me.

04:48.999 --> 04:51.110
- Of Sawyer.
- (cell phone ringing)

04:51.178 --> 04:53.851
Oh, um, I think you're getting a call.

04:53.956 --> 04:55.475
Oh, yeah.

04:55.543 --> 04:56.608
I, uh, yeah.

04:56.676 --> 04:58.195
I, um...

05:00.011 --> 05:01.365
(clearing throat)

05:01.433 --> 05:03.750
Okay, I'll, uh,

05:03.818 --> 05:04.457
I'll see you out there.

05:04.525 --> 05:05.758
Okay.

05:08.133 --> 05:11.165
What? When?

05:11.233 --> 05:14.000
Well, how the hell did that happen?

05:14.068 --> 05:16.506
Well, who else knows about this?

05:16.752 --> 05:19.659
No, no, I'll handle it.

05:21.790 --> 05:22.594
What's wrong?

05:22.662 --> 05:24.128
That was the director.

05:24.196 --> 05:27.024
Olivia Delidio was just
killed at her arraignment.

05:27.092 --> 05:28.737
- By who?
- Her lawyer.

05:28.805 --> 05:32.139
Right before she was about to
name a Russian intelligence source.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.039
She was being silenced.

05:34.107 --> 05:35.112
What have we got on the lawyer?

05:35.179 --> 05:36.589
The lawyer's dead, too.

05:36.657 --> 05:38.904
All we have is the location of the source.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.128
- Where?
- Here.

05:40.196 --> 05:42.786
The NYO has been compromised.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.483
The FBI has a mole.

A traitor, in here?

06:02.902 --> 06:05.631
The director wants me to
investigate everyone in the building,

06:05.699 --> 06:07.457
everyone with access to the building.

06:07.525 --> 06:10.047
If we start looking around, asking
questions, it's gonna raise red flags.

06:10.115 --> 06:13.781
Which is why I want you
to handle it, quietly.

06:13.849 --> 06:15.644
We'll start with Olivia's killer.

06:15.712 --> 06:16.697
Work out who hired her.

06:16.765 --> 06:18.299
Not "we."

06:18.653 --> 06:20.085
Just you.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.115
No one can know your real objective.

06:22.183 --> 06:24.480
It needs to look like business as usual.

06:24.587 --> 06:26.421
I'm not lying to my team.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.455
Sometimes you have to.

06:29.522 --> 06:30.723
Look...

06:30.830 --> 06:32.993
I think we need to
prepare for the possibility

06:33.061 --> 06:35.506
that it could be one of our guys.

06:35.574 --> 06:39.440
And even if it's not, internal
investigations are divisive.

06:39.508 --> 06:41.155
You start looking for one thing,

06:41.223 --> 06:43.892
who knows what else you're gonna find?

06:45.591 --> 06:48.793
So Olivia's assassin was
pretending to be a lawyer?

06:48.861 --> 06:50.116
No, she was a lawyer.

06:50.184 --> 06:53.656
Maria Blanter. She works for a firm
the Russian embassy keeps on retainer.

06:53.724 --> 06:57.213
She was a fixer. Olivia was obviously a
problem for someone in the Russian embassy.

06:57.281 --> 06:59.682
- Maria fixed it.
- He's right.

06:59.798 --> 07:01.036
(Reade) So how do we prove it?

07:01.104 --> 07:03.871
If you want to directly tie the
embassy to criminal activity,

07:03.939 --> 07:06.527
you're gonna need someone from inside.

07:06.595 --> 07:09.584
We believe Russian diplomats are
running an illegal smuggling ring.

07:09.677 --> 07:12.803
But every time I get close, they
shut down and switch things up.

07:12.871 --> 07:14.276
- Now I know why...
- Uh, Sloane,

07:14.344 --> 07:16.412
can I talk to you outside for a sec?

07:22.915 --> 07:24.377
Sloane, what are you doing?

07:24.445 --> 07:25.830
I heard about the courthouse.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.501
That Olivia was gonna
name an inside player here.

07:28.569 --> 07:30.385
Thought you might want some help.

07:30.453 --> 07:32.296
Don't look at me like that.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.907
I'm FBI counterintelligence.

07:33.975 --> 07:36.121
It's my job to know these things.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.813
The Russian spy ring was my case, remember?

07:38.881 --> 07:40.638
Fine.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.374
Don't mention the inside man.

07:43.526 --> 07:44.931
You think it's one of them?

07:44.999 --> 07:47.275
Start working the embassy angle.

07:52.993 --> 07:54.172
You stay on the door.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.012
I need someone on that
elevator, the conference room.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.172
Jackson, see what's down
there. You two with me.

08:03.326 --> 08:07.934
Well, you're certainly setting the
bar low for your replacement, Bethany.

08:08.023 --> 08:09.957
Not that I'm surprised.

08:10.105 --> 08:11.218
Did you call the OPR?

08:11.286 --> 08:12.991
No, she didn't, the director did.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.789
I was just about to give
my orientation speech

08:14.857 --> 08:16.564
for the new OPR agents, a rare honor,

08:16.632 --> 08:18.123
but then I get a call

08:18.191 --> 08:21.812
saying this outfit's
been compromised... again.

08:23.482 --> 08:26.517
Chief Inspector Jonas Fischer,
Office of Professional Responsibility.

08:26.584 --> 08:28.119
- I know who you are.
- Ah.

08:28.187 --> 08:29.782
This team has never been compromised.

08:29.850 --> 08:31.978
Well, I respectfully disagree.

08:32.046 --> 08:33.985
And I didn't cram myself
onto a sweaty train

08:34.053 --> 08:36.514
during morning rush hour
to watch the FBI bungle

08:36.582 --> 08:39.724
a Robert Hanssen-level breach... again.

08:40.712 --> 08:42.048
I'm gonna need a polygrapher.

08:42.116 --> 08:43.525
I'll need a holding space for the suspect,

08:43.594 --> 08:44.912
somewhere out in the open, please.

08:44.980 --> 08:46.762
And, you know,

08:46.830 --> 08:49.194
I'll use this office

08:49.262 --> 08:50.407
for follow-up questioning.

08:50.475 --> 08:53.043
Jonas, let's take it down a notch.

08:53.111 --> 08:56.042
This situation needs to
be handled with discretion.

08:56.110 --> 08:58.415
Heh, this isn't my first
square-dance, Bethany.

08:58.507 --> 09:00.957
You turn this into a witch-hunt,
you risk spooking them all.

09:01.025 --> 09:02.954
This office is rife with
irresponsible behavior

09:03.022 --> 09:05.402
and dangerous infractions, and...

09:05.477 --> 09:08.298
today, I'm going to
find out every last one.

09:08.647 --> 09:10.455
Someone get me a Turkish coffee?

09:10.610 --> 09:12.216
Please and thank you.

09:20.106 --> 09:21.679
What the hell was that about?

09:21.747 --> 09:24.868
He's been angling for my job
for the better part of a year.

09:24.994 --> 09:28.897
He's gonna use this investigation
to embarrass us and push me out.

09:28.965 --> 09:31.625
The last thing that we
need is that guy in charge.

09:31.693 --> 09:34.509
All right, so we got to find the
Russian source before he does.

09:35.903 --> 09:37.140
Patterson, clear those screens.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.643
- What's going on?
- No, please.

09:39.774 --> 09:41.157
Don't let me stop you.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.748
Just because you're under
investigation as well

09:42.816 --> 09:44.528
doesn't mean you shouldn't fumble about

09:44.596 --> 09:45.683
and see what you can find.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.387
Wait, why are we under investigation?

09:47.455 --> 09:48.756
Oh, he didn't tell you?

09:49.169 --> 09:52.314
The FBI's New York office
has been compromised.

09:52.481 --> 09:56.640
I'm here to spearhead the
investigation and root out the traitor.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.642
You knew about this?

09:58.860 --> 09:59.943
(Fischer) Well...

10:00.093 --> 10:02.672
maybe Special Agent Weller had
good reason not to trust you.

10:02.771 --> 10:05.226
Every closet has its skeleton.

10:05.294 --> 10:07.362
I look forward to meeting all of yours.

10:08.356 --> 10:10.487
And just to show that
no one's above suspicion,

10:10.577 --> 10:13.443
Agent Weller, you're up first.

10:19.963 --> 10:21.043
What is this?

10:21.111 --> 10:22.224
I asked for Turkish coffee.

10:22.292 --> 10:23.272
Well, that's all we have.

10:23.340 --> 10:28.072
Heh, what a fitting metaphor
for this office's shortcomings.

10:28.146 --> 10:30.229
Are we gonna start this or not?

10:31.669 --> 10:32.778
Do you work for the federal government?

10:32.846 --> 10:36.031
You know what, we'll skip the
formalities and get to the good stuff.

10:36.099 --> 10:39.555
Have you ever had sexual
relations with a co-worker?

10:40.765 --> 10:41.743
Yes, I have.

10:41.811 --> 10:44.646
Was that co-worker Allison Knight?

10:44.714 --> 10:46.651
- Yes.
- Are you currently involved

10:46.719 --> 10:47.556
with Ms. Knight?

10:47.624 --> 10:49.369
- No.
- Did you ever discuss FBI work

10:49.437 --> 10:51.295
outside this office with Ms. Knight?

10:51.362 --> 10:54.293
- Yes.
- Are you a Russian operative?

10:55.221 --> 10:56.038
No.

10:56.106 --> 10:59.303
Is Ms. Knight a Russian operative?

10:59.758 --> 11:00.633
No.

11:00.701 --> 11:04.176
Are you currently romantically involved
with any other co-worker or subordinate,

11:04.244 --> 11:05.706
Agent Weller?

11:09.401 --> 11:10.460
No.

11:14.928 --> 11:18.442
So... do you have any
theories on who it is?

11:18.817 --> 11:19.897
Do you?

11:19.965 --> 11:23.609
Anybody else find it weird Weller never
told us about the mole hunt to begin with?

11:23.677 --> 11:25.911
Do you think he suspects one of us?

11:28.024 --> 11:29.358
(door opens)

11:30.953 --> 11:33.045
Where are we on the Russian embassy?

11:33.331 --> 11:36.640
Okay, so Agent Sloane
zeroed in on Vlad Maslak,

11:36.708 --> 11:39.743
Slava Berezin, and Ilya Anasov.

11:39.811 --> 11:41.946
All Russian diplomats. All former FSB.

11:42.014 --> 11:45.888
They're using their diplomatic immunity to
run drugs, diamonds, and counterfeit cash.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.448
- You sure it's them?
- Positive.

11:47.516 --> 11:51.137
I took Sloane's raw intel and
ran some complex event processing.

11:51.280 --> 11:55.410
It's subtle, but my analytics show that
when these guys rotate back to Russia,

11:55.478 --> 11:56.601
the smuggling slows down.

11:56.669 --> 11:59.260
Sloane, still have an asset
in the Russian embassy?

11:59.328 --> 12:01.999
He's not ready... my relationship
with this guy is delicate.

12:02.066 --> 12:03.205
Why don't you want us to meet him?

12:03.273 --> 12:06.053
Worried about what he's gonna say.

12:06.121 --> 12:07.230
Can I have a sidebar?

12:07.298 --> 12:09.132
(Weller) Yes, you can.

12:12.593 --> 12:14.767
If I say he's not ready, he's not ready.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.615
I have to think of the long game.

12:16.683 --> 12:18.852
You won't have a long game if
we don't find this mole today.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.465
We can't just go down there.

12:20.533 --> 12:21.785
Get him to meet us somewhere else.

12:21.853 --> 12:23.954
We need every lead that we can get.

12:26.915 --> 12:28.115
All right.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.295
I'll reach out to my guy.

12:33.057 --> 12:34.054
She's dragging her heels.

12:34.122 --> 12:35.910
Because she's hanging by a thread.

12:35.978 --> 12:37.836
Three dead spies and a murdered civilian.

12:37.904 --> 12:39.166
She knows how that looks.

12:39.234 --> 12:40.526
How well do you know Agent Sloane?

12:40.594 --> 12:42.101
Not well enough.

12:42.169 --> 12:44.403
This is ridiculous... the whole building?

12:44.471 --> 12:46.621
- Yes, ma'am.
- (scoffs)

12:46.689 --> 12:47.543
What's going on?

12:47.611 --> 12:49.603
- They're locking us down.
- Why?

12:49.671 --> 12:52.346
We have orders not to let
anyone leave the building.

12:53.627 --> 12:55.968
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, no, it's just...

12:56.093 --> 12:58.457
even my standard FBI
polygraphs get flagged.

12:58.525 --> 12:59.621
And it always turns out fine.

12:59.689 --> 13:01.294
But if Fischer's looking for a weakness...

13:01.362 --> 13:03.205
Everybody knows you bomb tests.

13:03.273 --> 13:05.507
I'm the one who should be worried.

13:07.021 --> 13:08.544
Yeah, Zapata, I'm... I'm the mole.

13:08.612 --> 13:10.003
That's what I came in here to tell you.

13:10.071 --> 13:11.993
(scoffs)

13:12.061 --> 13:13.970
Look, we're talking about espionage,

13:14.038 --> 13:15.439
though, here, right?

13:15.596 --> 13:17.490
Fischer's definitely gonna
ask who we're in bed with.

13:17.558 --> 13:19.025
So?

13:21.263 --> 13:23.195
Wait, who are you in bed with?

13:24.859 --> 13:26.448
Sarah Weller.

13:28.152 --> 13:29.465
Are you crazy?

13:29.533 --> 13:30.942
Does Weller know?

13:31.809 --> 13:32.867
You gotta tell him.

13:32.935 --> 13:34.702
You think I don't know that?

13:35.781 --> 13:37.115
Here's the thing, though, do I?

13:37.183 --> 13:38.483
Reade, it's Weller.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.069
If you're hiding something,
he's gonna find out.

13:41.180 --> 13:43.080
You're no help.

13:45.968 --> 13:48.911
Just... state your name
for the record, please.

13:48.979 --> 13:49.668
Jane Doe.

13:49.736 --> 13:51.772
Ah... your real name.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.158
Um...

13:55.578 --> 13:57.145
Taylor Shaw.

13:57.973 --> 14:01.016
I understand you've been
through this process recently.

14:01.084 --> 14:04.630
This time, I expect your answers to
be a little more illuminating than

14:04.698 --> 14:06.449
"I don't know."

14:07.248 --> 14:08.481
State your mother's name.

14:08.549 --> 14:09.822
Emma Shaw.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.916
Have you ever been directly or
indirectly involved with or assisted

14:12.999 --> 14:15.267
a terrorist organization?

14:17.468 --> 14:20.074
- No.
- Are you yourself a terrorist?

14:20.142 --> 14:21.672
- No.
- Are you a Russian operative?

14:21.740 --> 14:23.894
- No.
- Is your mother Russian?

14:23.962 --> 14:24.975
No.

14:25.043 --> 14:29.456
I'm sorry, it says here in your file
that your mother is one-eighth Russian.

14:29.524 --> 14:31.294
Is that a clerical error?

14:31.362 --> 14:32.671
She's seven-eighths English.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.758
Oh... but she is Russian.

14:36.974 --> 14:39.169
- Yes.
- Are you a Russian operative?

14:39.237 --> 14:40.580
Am I a Russian operative?

14:40.648 --> 14:41.639
Please answer the question.

14:41.707 --> 14:43.693
Are you a Russian operative? Yes or no.

14:43.761 --> 14:45.446
- No.
- Do you speak Russian?

14:45.514 --> 14:46.481
- Yes.
- No.

14:46.549 --> 14:47.536
- No.
- Are you trained in

14:47.604 --> 14:50.987
the Russian martial
arts of Systema or Sambo?

14:51.055 --> 14:51.928
Yes.

14:51.996 --> 14:54.278
Ah, which one? For the record.

14:54.346 --> 14:56.706
Both, I-I think.

14:56.774 --> 14:58.322
My.

14:58.390 --> 15:00.983
Have you ever removed government
property from this office?

15:01.051 --> 15:02.328
- No.
- Really, Agent Reade?

15:02.396 --> 15:06.243
Not a pen? Box of paperclips?

15:06.311 --> 15:07.350
Yes, I've taken a pen.

15:07.418 --> 15:11.242
Ah, and did you share that
property with someone else?

15:11.310 --> 15:13.822
- Yes.
- David Wagner.

15:13.890 --> 15:16.259
Is he... I'm sorry.

15:16.389 --> 15:19.668
- Was he a Russian spy?
- No.

15:19.736 --> 15:21.285
But he was killed by a Russian spy.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.378
Not unlike Olivia Delidio.

15:23.446 --> 15:24.557
Is that... is that a question?

15:24.625 --> 15:27.391
- Did you order the death of David Wagner?
- No.

15:27.459 --> 15:31.394
Do you feel responsible for
the death of David Wagner?

15:34.130 --> 15:34.921
Yes.

15:34.989 --> 15:36.497
Did you order the death of Olivia Delidio

15:36.565 --> 15:39.114
so she would not reveal your name as a spy?

15:39.182 --> 15:40.291
No... what? No.

15:40.359 --> 15:43.100
Your number was in her cell phone.

15:43.168 --> 15:44.087
Excuse me?

15:44.155 --> 15:47.883
Olivia Delidio's assassin, your
personal cell was in her phone.

15:47.951 --> 15:50.368
- Does that surprise you?
- Yes.

15:50.765 --> 15:53.691
Do you have full access to
the FBI's New York office?

15:53.759 --> 15:54.720
- Yes.
- No.

15:54.788 --> 15:55.857
- No.
- Do you have access

15:55.925 --> 15:59.102
to its equipment, its files, its databases?

15:59.170 --> 16:00.795
(all) Yes.

16:00.863 --> 16:03.169
Do you consult with the CIA?

16:03.291 --> 16:03.866
No.

16:03.934 --> 16:05.243
Do you know Thomas Carter?

16:05.311 --> 16:06.797
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:06.899 --> 16:07.984
No, not really.

16:08.052 --> 16:09.842
Could you answer yes or no, please?

16:09.910 --> 16:12.607
- Do you know Thomas Carter?
- Yes.

16:12.675 --> 16:14.625
Do you work with Thomas Carter at the CIA?

16:14.693 --> 16:16.417
At the CIA, no.

16:16.519 --> 16:18.973
I'll rephrase... do you
work with Thomas Carter,

16:19.041 --> 16:21.315
- who is a CIA agent?
- No.

16:21.383 --> 16:23.129
But you had one case recently

16:23.197 --> 16:25.774
that overlapped with one of
Tom Carter's operations, no?

16:25.842 --> 16:27.543
Yes.

16:28.103 --> 16:31.682
- Have you seen Tom Carter recently?
- No.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.185
(all) No.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.380
No!

16:34.681 --> 16:36.208
No.

16:38.987 --> 16:40.787
Thank you, that's all I need.

16:40.855 --> 16:43.023
(indistinct chatter)

16:44.089 --> 16:45.222
Kurt.

16:45.329 --> 16:47.196
- What's up?
- Um...

16:48.912 --> 16:50.412
Damn it, um...

16:52.089 --> 16:53.423
I'm dating your sister.

16:53.491 --> 16:55.400
I've been meaning to tell you for weeks.

16:55.468 --> 16:56.527
So you're telling me now?

16:56.595 --> 16:58.233
I know... I know it's bad, it's just...

16:58.344 --> 17:01.345
I don't want you to find out
from some stupid interrogation.

17:06.088 --> 17:07.470
You need to lift the lockdown.

17:07.544 --> 17:09.373
We got a solid lead at the Russian embassy.

17:09.441 --> 17:11.740
The traitor isn't at the Russian embassy.

17:11.808 --> 17:12.982
She's right here at the FBI.

17:13.050 --> 17:14.717
What do you mean, "she"?

17:15.046 --> 17:17.454
Ms. Doe, Agent Zapata,

17:17.568 --> 17:19.259
Assistant Director Mayfair.

17:19.327 --> 17:23.136
They all had a dizzying number of
inconsistencies on their polygraphs.

17:25.031 --> 17:27.317
Each of these women is hiding something.

17:27.509 --> 17:29.477
I'm gonna find out what.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.420
They could've at least
put us down in holding.

17:41.488 --> 17:43.926
Fischer wants us on display.

17:44.075 --> 17:47.409
Right now, his OPR agents
are tearing our lives apart.

17:47.477 --> 17:51.273
Our homes, our offices, our computers.

17:51.388 --> 17:52.658
What's he looking for?

17:52.726 --> 17:54.782
Anything and everything.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.241
This is about me.

17:59.014 --> 18:01.986
He wants my job. He
doesn't care about the mole.

18:02.054 --> 18:04.284
He just wants to disgrace me.

18:04.352 --> 18:07.485
You two are just caught in the crossfire.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.211
(man) Assistant Director Mayfair?

18:15.510 --> 18:17.335
So how well do you know Mayfair?

18:17.403 --> 18:17.967
Isn't it a little coinciden...

18:18.035 --> 18:19.993
He's railroading them. It's a career move.

18:20.061 --> 18:21.033
We're running out of time, we need you

18:21.101 --> 18:22.687
- to bring in your asset.
- He's hyper-careful.

18:22.755 --> 18:24.874
He's not just gonna walk
himself into the FBI.

18:24.942 --> 18:26.234
What do you got on this guy, anyway?

18:26.302 --> 18:27.660
Roman's an embassy driver.

18:27.728 --> 18:29.089
We found heroin in his glove box.

18:29.157 --> 18:30.610
He played ball to stay out of jail.

18:30.678 --> 18:32.731
- So tell him you'll let him off.
- I can't just say that.

18:32.799 --> 18:35.059
I'd have to actually let him off the hook.

18:35.172 --> 18:37.861
Sloane, we need this.

18:39.548 --> 18:41.615
I'll see what I can do.

18:44.161 --> 18:46.527
What about the lockdown?
How's she gonna get her guy in?

18:46.680 --> 18:47.881
Don't worry.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.874
I know a guy, too.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.775
A lot of redactions in
this Saul Guerrero file.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.374
Just how compromised are you, Bethany?

18:57.442 --> 18:59.584
I wouldn't start moving
in my things just yet.

18:59.652 --> 19:01.091
Gang leader,

19:01.159 --> 19:02.741
notorious federal informant.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.269
Murdered in a supermax penitentiary

19:04.337 --> 19:05.946
at the exact time you
were there to see him.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.978
- That's a coincidence?
- Yes.

19:08.046 --> 19:09.187
You were his handler.

19:09.255 --> 19:11.583
Maybe he found out something you
didn't want other people to know.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.885
If you really had something,

19:12.952 --> 19:14.976
we wouldn't still be sitting here.

19:15.044 --> 19:17.880
My team and I are clean.

19:17.948 --> 19:18.843
(chuckling)

19:18.911 --> 19:20.479
Look at this.

19:20.781 --> 19:23.666
It's like a toddler got
hold of an Etch A Sketch.

19:23.734 --> 19:24.814
I'm bad at tests.

19:24.882 --> 19:26.131
Oh, I know.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.954
I pulled all of your
standard FBI evaluations.

19:29.022 --> 19:32.421
What's more interesting to me is this.

19:34.078 --> 19:35.536
You recognize this?

19:35.604 --> 19:38.472
This is a surveillance device,

19:38.540 --> 19:41.242
and I want it inside Jane's safe house.

19:42.188 --> 19:43.615
No.

19:43.805 --> 19:45.732
We found it inside your home.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.200
I've never seen that before.

19:47.268 --> 19:50.820
Hmm, no, I suppose you wouldn't have.

19:50.955 --> 19:53.635
My men found it inside a light switch.

19:53.703 --> 19:55.881
CIA bugs like this are
impossible to sweep for,

19:55.949 --> 19:59.264
but if you know where to
look, sometimes you get lucky.

19:59.454 --> 20:00.861
Now the question is,

20:00.929 --> 20:03.128
why is the CIA bugging your home?

20:03.196 --> 20:04.659
I have no idea.

20:04.777 --> 20:09.240
Tasha, I think we've established
that I can tell when you're lying.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.144
Tom Carter wanted intel on Jane.

20:17.212 --> 20:19.275
- Mm-hmm?
- I told him to go to hell.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.887
He must've planted this in my
apartment to look for leverage.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.455
- What did he find?
- Nothing.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.611
I wonder if he'd say the same thing.

20:25.679 --> 20:29.137
Oh, but he's missing and presumed dead.

20:30.374 --> 20:32.458
That's convenient.

20:34.545 --> 20:35.867
So that's how it is, huh?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.537
You don't call me back
till you need something.

20:37.605 --> 20:38.455
Come on, Roman.

20:38.523 --> 20:39.764
(Weller) Thank you, Halley.

20:39.832 --> 20:40.790
I owe you one.

20:40.858 --> 20:42.007
You owe me multiple.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.472
So what's going on around here, anyway?

20:44.540 --> 20:46.342
You know Jonas Fischer from the OPR?

20:46.410 --> 20:47.496
Yeah, unfortunately.

20:47.564 --> 20:49.701
We met after the WITSEC list leaked... why?

20:49.769 --> 20:51.825
He's here on a mole hunt.

20:51.893 --> 20:53.367
So, unfortunately,

20:53.435 --> 20:54.735
no one can leave until he finds it.

20:54.803 --> 20:57.065
Wait, what? So I'm stuck here now.

20:57.133 --> 20:59.367
Ugh, Kurt, you could've mentioned that.

20:59.435 --> 21:01.056
I'm sorry, if I'd've mentioned it,

21:01.124 --> 21:02.367
- you wouldn't be here.
- (scoffs)

21:02.435 --> 21:03.435
Ah...

21:04.810 --> 21:06.669
Well, do they have any suspects?

21:06.807 --> 21:09.060
Mayfair, Zapata, Jane.

21:09.128 --> 21:10.002
Who do you think it is?

21:10.070 --> 21:10.936
None of them.

21:11.004 --> 21:13.986
That is where Roman comes in.

21:14.068 --> 21:15.168
Come on.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.183
(indistinct arguing)

21:26.595 --> 21:28.393
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

21:28.461 --> 21:31.352
Just impressing upon Roman
the importance of cooperating.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.197
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is

21:33.265 --> 21:35.871
- for me to be here?
- Yes, I do.

21:35.939 --> 21:37.244
That's why I'm keeping it quiet.

21:37.312 --> 21:42.201
Now, what can you tell me about the guys
that you drive for... Vlad, Slava, Ilya?

21:42.321 --> 21:44.772
Sloane told me that I'm
off the hook if I come in.

21:44.840 --> 21:48.045
Now, I am not talking until
I see a deal in writing.

21:50.658 --> 21:52.340
(sighs)

21:52.447 --> 21:54.214
Look at that camera.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.517
Here's the deal... you start talking,

21:58.639 --> 22:01.013
or I send that to the Russian embassy.

22:03.919 --> 22:05.220
What do you wanna know?

22:14.390 --> 22:15.531
(Fischer) Agent Reade.

22:15.599 --> 22:17.121
With me, please.

22:21.804 --> 22:23.369
_

22:26.764 --> 22:29.438
Did you trust Ms. Doe initially, Edgar?

22:29.506 --> 22:31.742
No, but then she earned it.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.044
Sounds like Tom Carter
didn't trust her, either.

22:34.112 --> 22:35.643
In fact, Agent Zapata told me

22:35.711 --> 22:38.499
that he approached her
about informing on Jane.

22:39.616 --> 22:41.131
Did he approach you, too?

22:41.199 --> 22:42.557
Yeah, and I said no.

22:42.625 --> 22:43.668
What do you think he was looking for?

22:43.736 --> 22:44.860
I wouldn't know.

22:45.001 --> 22:49.140
He's not exactly around for me
to ask him that question, is he?

22:49.208 --> 22:50.280
Lucky for Jane.

22:50.348 --> 22:53.148
Lucky for a lot of people... Carter
made a career out of making enemies.

22:53.216 --> 22:54.501
So you believe he was killed?

22:54.569 --> 22:56.539
I don't believe it was suicide.

22:57.359 --> 23:00.017
Were Carter and Jane ever alone together?

23:00.114 --> 23:02.444
Well, that'd be tricky...
Jane's either at home,

23:02.512 --> 23:03.888
at work, or with a detail.

23:03.956 --> 23:07.356
But I was under the impression that
her detail had been officially lifted

23:07.424 --> 23:09.763
by Assistant Director Mayfair

23:09.831 --> 23:10.831
at Jane's request.

23:10.899 --> 23:12.452
That was after Carter disappeared.

23:12.520 --> 23:15.855
So she never went out without
her detail before that?

23:15.923 --> 23:17.039
Not to my knowledge.

23:17.107 --> 23:18.866
Agent Reid says she went
out without her detail

23:18.934 --> 23:21.553
all the time... you're
contradicting his story.

23:21.621 --> 23:24.021
- No, I'm not, that's...
- Is Agent Reade lying?

23:24.089 --> 23:25.412
You're calling him a liar.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.254
I don't know why Reade would say that.

23:27.322 --> 23:28.473
He wasn't even...

23:28.952 --> 23:31.413
Jane didn't go out without
her detail all the time.

23:31.481 --> 23:33.951
Oh, so just some of the time?

23:34.019 --> 23:36.477
Agent Patterson, I already know she did it.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.882
I just need to know where
she went and who she saw.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.865
I don't... no one.

23:40.933 --> 23:42.187
Mm, no one?

23:42.255 --> 23:44.557
Jane said she... she...

23:44.625 --> 23:47.064
wanted to be alone sometimes.

23:47.132 --> 23:49.734
Ms. Doe said that?

23:52.184 --> 23:55.237
Yes, we went out for drinks
to blow off some steam.

23:55.305 --> 23:57.333
And I get it.

23:57.401 --> 23:58.358
Her life is crazy...

23:58.426 --> 24:02.621
Is there anyone who can account for
Ms. Doe's whereabouts on the night of

24:02.689 --> 24:04.851
Tom Carter's... disappearance?

24:04.919 --> 24:06.729
I can.

24:06.797 --> 24:09.663
She was here at work until late.

24:09.731 --> 24:11.257
And then she went home with her detail.

24:11.325 --> 24:13.887
You, uh, just said she slipped her detail.

24:13.955 --> 24:16.079
No, it's her protective detail.

24:16.147 --> 24:18.368
She's not a prisoner.

24:18.436 --> 24:19.853
Not yet.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.687
All I do is drive.

24:28.755 --> 24:30.103
I take 'em to their meet-ups.

24:30.171 --> 24:32.384
Who do they meet? FBI agents?

24:32.452 --> 24:34.247
(chuckling) How would I know?

24:34.315 --> 24:35.656
It isn't like anyone's wearing a badge.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.195
I know you know more than you're saying.

24:37.263 --> 24:39.645
Who's gonna talk, you...

24:39.713 --> 24:41.681
or that photo?

24:42.571 --> 24:44.005
All right, okay.

24:44.319 --> 24:48.618
One time I heard Slava
say he had... inside help.

24:48.861 --> 24:51.887
- Did he mention a name?
- No, I swear.

24:51.955 --> 24:55.148
I-I-I stay in the car, I make runs to
Akbar's when they're making their deals.

24:55.216 --> 24:56.339
I don't hear anything.

24:56.407 --> 24:57.908
Are you gonna keep going?

24:57.976 --> 25:00.545
- Or shall I send this to...
- But I... I see things.

25:00.613 --> 25:03.244
I see people, faces.

25:03.361 --> 25:05.496
I have a very good memory for faces.

25:05.564 --> 25:06.443
Great.

25:06.511 --> 25:08.931
Sloane, take him to the lab.

25:08.999 --> 25:11.643
Show him the photo IDs of
everyone who works here.

25:12.999 --> 25:15.658
Hey, are you sure you're not making
this harder than it needs to be?

25:15.726 --> 25:17.872
The simplest answer is
usually the right one.

25:17.940 --> 25:18.888
Jane.

25:18.956 --> 25:23.133
She's the only person in this building
whose entire past is a question mark.

25:23.201 --> 25:25.485
Is this about Jane's past or ours?

25:25.553 --> 25:27.829
Look... however you feel about her,

25:27.897 --> 25:29.294
you don't know who she is.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.969
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.

25:31.037 --> 25:32.948
(door slams)

25:33.016 --> 25:34.976
Fischer's looking for you.

25:35.044 --> 25:36.722
(Fischer) So, you lied to me.

25:36.790 --> 25:38.632
I asked if you were in
a romantic relationship

25:38.700 --> 25:40.931
with any of your co-workers, you said no.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.676
Your polygraph disagrees.

25:42.744 --> 25:43.954
- I didn't lie.
- Mm.

25:44.022 --> 25:46.043
I sent agents to your home.

25:46.111 --> 25:47.963
Your sister was not
particularly cooperative,

25:48.031 --> 25:50.278
but little Sawyer

25:50.346 --> 25:54.137
was very eager to tell us all about
how he saw you and Auntie Taylor

25:54.205 --> 25:56.830
kissing outside your house.

25:56.898 --> 26:00.651
One kiss does not mean that
we're romantically involved.

26:00.729 --> 26:04.611
Is it getting hot in here, Agent Weller?

26:04.861 --> 26:07.543
I'm not the one wearing
a three-piece suit.

26:07.720 --> 26:12.173
Well, some of us still respect
the formality of this office.

26:12.882 --> 26:14.659
You were sleeping with the enemy.

26:14.727 --> 26:17.086
Jane's not the enemy, and, no,
we're not sleeping together.

26:17.154 --> 26:19.326
(chuckling) That's adorable.

26:19.394 --> 26:21.375
We're all grownups
here. You don't expect me

26:21.443 --> 26:23.459
to believe this just ended with a kiss.

26:23.527 --> 26:24.775
We did not sleep together.

26:24.843 --> 26:27.432
And her detail will confirm that?

26:27.515 --> 26:29.983
- No.
- So you admit she was alone?

26:30.105 --> 26:31.539
Yes.

26:31.648 --> 26:33.426
We met...

26:33.494 --> 26:35.675
we talked, and we kissed.

26:35.743 --> 26:37.357
And then she went home.

26:37.425 --> 26:39.442
What has this got to do with the mole hunt?

26:39.510 --> 26:42.737
Did you walk Ms. Jane Doe to her door?

26:46.391 --> 26:47.283
No.

26:47.350 --> 26:50.219
So you can't confirm
that she even went home.

26:50.287 --> 26:51.401
Hang on, what I'm telling you...

26:51.469 --> 26:54.194
I'm just trying to establish a timeline.

26:54.262 --> 26:57.402
Agent Patterson told me she saw
Jane go home with her detail.

26:57.470 --> 27:00.863
You've just confirmed she subsequently met
you later that night without her detail,

27:00.931 --> 27:04.572
after which she left,
totally unaccounted for,

27:04.640 --> 27:07.011
on the last night Tom
Carter was seen alive.

27:07.079 --> 27:10.975
The only person who knows where
Jane really was that night is Jane.

27:14.507 --> 27:17.175
So, stop me if I'm
getting any of this wrong.

27:17.243 --> 27:19.256
Tom Carter didn't trust you.

27:19.324 --> 27:20.666
He wanted you in his custody.

27:20.734 --> 27:22.544
He would stop at nothing to get you.

27:22.612 --> 27:25.857
He posed a direct threat to
your life and to your mission.

27:25.925 --> 27:28.329
- I don't have a mission.
- Hmm.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.057
But the kicker is,

27:30.125 --> 27:31.976
you can't account for
the majority of your time

27:32.044 --> 27:33.840
on the night he disappeared.

27:33.908 --> 27:36.144
Yes, I can, I was with Agent Weller,

27:36.212 --> 27:37.848
- and then I went...
- Straight home.

27:37.916 --> 27:40.051
Yeah. So you've said.

27:40.119 --> 27:42.598
So, why do these photos

27:42.666 --> 27:46.198
show you avoiding security cameras

27:46.319 --> 27:48.347
at your safe house

27:48.415 --> 27:51.250
at 4:00 in the morning?

27:51.795 --> 27:55.002
You didn't account for the
window reflections, Ms. Doe.

27:57.879 --> 28:00.411
I couldn't sleep, so I went for a run.

28:00.479 --> 28:01.846
You're lying.

28:03.026 --> 28:05.246
You didn't go home after kissing Weller.

28:05.314 --> 28:08.564
You went after Carter, because
he found out your secret.

28:08.702 --> 28:10.396
And then you killed him.

28:11.287 --> 28:13.293
(Jane) <i>No, you're wrong.</i>

28:13.361 --> 28:15.143
<i>I am not a mole.</i>

28:15.211 --> 28:16.614
You're caught, Ms. Doe.

28:16.682 --> 28:19.529
I'm telling you the truth,
I didn't kill Carter.

28:19.597 --> 28:21.821
No one's confirmed that
Carter is even dead.

28:21.889 --> 28:24.602
Are you confirming that he's dead?

28:24.670 --> 28:26.836
<i>Your polygraph is
practically a straight line.</i>

28:26.904 --> 28:28.868
I've seen sociopaths with more spikes.

28:28.936 --> 28:31.883
The truth is, you were
kidnapped at the age of five.

28:31.951 --> 28:34.295
You were trafficked to Russia,
you were taught the language.

28:34.363 --> 28:37.558
You were taught to lie,
you were trained to fight.

28:37.626 --> 28:38.716
(gunshots)

28:38.784 --> 28:39.693
Do it again.

28:39.761 --> 28:43.343
And then sent back to the United
States to infiltrate the FBI.

28:43.411 --> 28:45.331
Reade suspected it.

28:45.399 --> 28:47.408
But Carter proved it.

28:47.476 --> 28:50.972
And he and Agent Patterson's
boyfriend were murdered because of it.

28:51.040 --> 28:56.233
You actually spoke Russian to a
fellow Russian spy in this very room.

28:56.301 --> 28:59.160
Olivia Delidio recognized you.

28:59.362 --> 29:03.722
(speaking Russian)

29:03.790 --> 29:04.674
(Russian continues)

29:04.742 --> 29:06.412
But before she could name you,

29:06.480 --> 29:09.390
your handlers had her killed.

29:11.133 --> 29:13.121
It's over, Jane Doe.

29:13.876 --> 29:17.345
Now, isn't part of you a little relieved?

29:20.186 --> 29:22.955
(computer beeping faintly)

29:25.349 --> 29:26.653
Has he recognized anyone yet?

29:26.721 --> 29:28.848
No. We're dealing with
over 1,000 photos here.

29:28.916 --> 29:31.278
Look faster, we're running out of time.

29:34.196 --> 29:37.232
Well, thank you for making
this so easy for me, Bethany.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.860
It's almost like you
want me to take your job.

29:39.928 --> 29:41.339
What're you gonna do with her?

29:41.407 --> 29:43.591
Give her time to consider
making a full confession,

29:43.659 --> 29:45.464
then arrest her.

29:45.532 --> 29:47.800
Arrest her for what? Your
evidence is circumstantial.

29:47.868 --> 29:50.345
No body, no weapon...
all you've got is a photo.

29:50.413 --> 29:52.614
You're trying to twist the rest
into a narrative you can't prove.

29:52.682 --> 29:55.086
Why can't you see what's right in
front of your eyes, Agent Weller?

29:55.154 --> 29:58.107
I've got a guy in Patterson's lab
that can ID the Russian source.

29:58.174 --> 29:59.648
What "guy"?

29:59.716 --> 30:04.031
Roman Kozar, a driver that Agent Sloane
has turned in the Russian embassy.

30:04.099 --> 30:08.248
Well, have you considered the fact that
this Roman Kozar might just tell you

30:08.316 --> 30:09.745
anything you want to hear
in order to get out of

30:09.813 --> 30:12.242
whatever charge you
apparently have against him?

30:12.310 --> 30:13.302
Do you wanna find the mole or not?

30:13.370 --> 30:15.271
I have found the mole.

30:15.816 --> 30:19.477
But fine, I'd be happy to
confirm it with your guy.

30:26.118 --> 30:31.997
And once again, Agent Patterson gives
a random civilian access to FBI files.

30:32.065 --> 30:35.183
Are you trying to get someone else
in your immediate proximity killed?

30:35.251 --> 30:36.799
Roman hasn't found anything.

30:36.867 --> 30:38.496
Still have a lot of
photos left to go through.

30:38.564 --> 30:40.420
- But it's just...
- Maybe you're looking in the wrong place.

30:40.488 --> 30:42.438
Maybe it's not an agent.

30:42.506 --> 30:46.575
Why don't you show him a picture
of the NYO's newest consultant?

30:48.946 --> 30:50.292
Fine.

30:50.454 --> 30:51.821
Go ahead.

30:53.711 --> 30:55.078
(Patterson typing)

30:56.199 --> 30:57.412
- Her!
- No.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.205
I know her face, I've seen her,

30:59.273 --> 31:01.223
with Slava... I would know
those tattoos anywhere.

31:01.291 --> 31:03.467
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It's her.

31:03.535 --> 31:06.237
It makes plenty of sense, Agent Weller,

31:06.305 --> 31:08.210
if you're willing to see it.

31:08.469 --> 31:11.347
Call the director, tell
him I've caught his mole.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.242
Please stand.

31:15.976 --> 31:17.443
(handcuffs snapping)

31:18.493 --> 31:20.697
Jane... Jane!

31:20.765 --> 31:22.296
Kurt, I didn't do this.

31:22.364 --> 31:24.541
I believe you, all right?
Don't say a thing to them.

31:24.609 --> 31:27.477
I'll find out the truth. Okay? You hear me?

31:33.384 --> 31:35.790
- Fischer made his case.
- Fischer's wrong.

31:35.858 --> 31:37.118
Jane didn't do this.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.185
- We need to find the real traitor.
- Kurt.

31:39.253 --> 31:42.277
- Look, I know you don't wanna hear this.
- All right, so don't say it.

31:42.350 --> 31:44.529
Talk to them, please.

31:45.814 --> 31:47.248
You too?

31:47.518 --> 31:50.004
So the Russian diplomats tattooed her,

31:50.072 --> 31:53.107
wiped her memory, and dropped her
in Times Square to help them smuggle?

31:53.175 --> 31:55.608
She hasn't been with us long
enough to be useful to them.

31:55.676 --> 31:57.912
She doesn't have any access
to the intel they'd need.

31:57.980 --> 31:59.739
Her tattoos led us to the Russians!

31:59.807 --> 32:02.638
They're solving crimes, not enabling them.

32:02.706 --> 32:03.705
Jane is not the mole.

32:03.773 --> 32:06.415
Then why did Roman ID her?

32:09.431 --> 32:11.554
You're a Russian counterintelligence agent.

32:11.622 --> 32:13.504
You've had years to bust this spy ring.

32:13.572 --> 32:15.533
You didn't, why?

32:15.626 --> 32:16.864
You're protecting them.

32:16.932 --> 32:18.109
Roman's your guy.

32:18.177 --> 32:19.727
He ID'd Jane because you told him to.

32:19.795 --> 32:21.937
I have been here all
day trying to help you.

32:22.005 --> 32:23.518
We didn't call you in here today.

32:23.586 --> 32:24.546
You just showed up.

32:24.614 --> 32:26.374
- This is insane.
- Is it?

32:26.442 --> 32:29.517
Let's see what Roman has to say
when you're not there to coach him.

32:29.585 --> 32:31.499
Don't let her out of your sight.

32:32.529 --> 32:33.764
- It's Sloane, isn't it?
- What?

32:33.832 --> 32:35.604
- You tell me the truth...
- What, what, what?!

32:35.672 --> 32:36.546
Tell me the truth!

32:36.614 --> 32:38.702
Weller, stop it!

32:43.527 --> 32:45.094
Art Trevisan.

32:48.375 --> 32:49.852
You said you make runs to Akbar's?

32:49.920 --> 32:51.721
- What do they sell?
- Coffee.

32:51.789 --> 32:53.047
What kind?

32:53.115 --> 32:55.870
The black, sludgy stuff
with the... the grinds.

32:55.938 --> 32:57.788
Someone get me a Turkish coffee.

32:58.325 --> 33:01.327
Fischer's orientation
for the new OPR agents.

33:01.567 --> 33:03.067
Where was it?

33:04.185 --> 33:05.998
Newark, 8:00 a.m.

33:06.066 --> 33:09.203
I was just about to give my orientation
speech for the new OPR agents.

33:09.271 --> 33:10.981
Then I get a call.

33:11.049 --> 33:14.570
Olivia was found dead 8:06 a.m.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.064
What time did the director call you?

33:16.132 --> 33:18.292
8:30, I was his first call.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.666
Fischer arrived just before 9:00.

33:20.734 --> 33:23.842
I didn't cram myself onto a sweaty
train during morning rush hour...

33:23.910 --> 33:26.147
There's no way Fischer
took a train from Newark

33:26.215 --> 33:28.439
and got here by 9:00 a.m.

33:28.507 --> 33:32.156
Unless he was tipped off by
the people that ordered the hit.

33:32.224 --> 33:33.996
It's a perfect cover, isn't it?

33:34.064 --> 33:35.700
Fischer's got OPR jurisdiction.

33:35.768 --> 33:38.608
Which means he can shut down anyone
that gets close to the smugglers.

33:38.676 --> 33:40.510
Fischer's the mole, isn't he?

33:41.750 --> 33:43.284
Answer me.

33:44.916 --> 33:47.020
Answer me... answer me...

33:47.088 --> 33:48.979
- Answer me!
- I had to lie, you heard him!

33:49.047 --> 33:50.270
He said he was gonna kill me!

33:50.338 --> 33:54.595
Are you trying to get someone else
in your immediate proximity killed?

33:55.006 --> 33:57.341
He's a very dangerous man.

33:59.183 --> 34:01.669
If Fischer's the double-agent,
he knows that Jane isn't.

34:01.737 --> 34:04.406
He'll try to silence her
before anyone can prove it.

34:19.404 --> 34:22.290
You know, our OPR detention facilities
are actually quite comfortable.

34:22.357 --> 34:23.616
But I don't think you'll be here for long.

34:23.684 --> 34:25.538
You have the wrong person, I'm innocent.

34:25.606 --> 34:28.808
Innocent people have alibis.

34:29.130 --> 34:32.234
So where were you the
night Carter was killed?

34:32.387 --> 34:34.250
I didn't kill him.

34:34.329 --> 34:35.929
Maybe not.

34:36.058 --> 34:37.270
It only means whatever you were up to

34:37.338 --> 34:40.128
till 4:00 a.m. that
morning must've been worse.

34:40.196 --> 34:44.259
I collected my evidence against
you in a matter of hours.

34:44.391 --> 34:49.224
Imagine what I'll find in a
few days or weeks or months,

34:49.330 --> 34:53.266
as you sit in a dark hole,
awaiting trial for treason.

34:53.420 --> 34:55.759
I'm going to bury you, Jane.

35:12.445 --> 35:13.578
(beeping)

35:18.882 --> 35:21.701
(Weller) Stop! Jane!

35:22.864 --> 35:24.872
- FBI, FBI, FBI!
- (overlapping shouting)

35:24.940 --> 35:26.707
FBI! Move it!

35:26.822 --> 35:29.390
He's corrupt! Jane! It's Fischer!

35:29.458 --> 35:31.304
- He's the mole!
- The second Weller breaches that door,

35:31.372 --> 35:32.462
he's committing treason as well.

35:32.530 --> 35:33.375
Get her to holding.

35:33.443 --> 35:35.663
I'm gonna call the director.

35:35.731 --> 35:36.439
Jane!

35:36.507 --> 35:38.520
Open this door! It's him!

35:38.588 --> 35:40.723
We've gotta stop him! Let me past.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.742
(grunting)

35:48.274 --> 35:49.607
Gah!

35:52.357 --> 35:53.424
(beeping)

36:04.152 --> 36:05.920
(beeping)

36:08.307 --> 36:09.801
(Jane) Fischer!

36:16.212 --> 36:17.726
Fischer!

36:21.499 --> 36:23.082
Jane!

36:23.410 --> 36:25.776
Now... just hang on.

36:25.844 --> 36:27.286
Ohh!

36:31.049 --> 36:32.617
Jane!

36:32.849 --> 36:34.162
(beeping)

36:34.308 --> 36:35.342
Jane!

36:38.905 --> 36:41.206
He was going for his gun.

36:48.113 --> 36:49.714
He's dead.

37:01.532 --> 37:03.033
So what happens now?

37:03.101 --> 37:05.624
Sloane and her team are gonna
pick up the Russian diplomats.

37:05.692 --> 37:08.557
If they don't go down for smuggling,
we've got them on espionage

37:08.625 --> 37:09.954
and conspiracy.

37:10.025 --> 37:11.212
At the very least,

37:11.280 --> 37:13.308
they'll get deported back to Russia.

37:13.376 --> 37:16.179
On a day like today, that's a win.

37:16.247 --> 37:18.153
I meant, what happens to me?

37:19.149 --> 37:20.437
You go home.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.086
When you shot Fischer,

37:23.154 --> 37:24.993
he was going for his gun.

37:25.107 --> 37:27.582
Your life felt... threatened.

37:29.371 --> 37:30.838
Self-defense.

37:33.219 --> 37:35.887
Thank you...

37:36.139 --> 37:39.051
for standing up for me, for believing me.

37:39.142 --> 37:41.710
If you wanna go somewhere,
we can talk about it.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.653
I think I should just go home.

37:48.131 --> 37:49.498
Okay.

37:55.835 --> 37:57.235
Hey, good night, Kurt.

37:57.326 --> 37:59.293
Reade.

37:59.425 --> 38:02.527
You and Sarah, is it serious?

38:02.662 --> 38:03.884
Yeah.

38:04.133 --> 38:06.379
I wouldn't be with her if it wasn't.

38:06.507 --> 38:08.041
End it.

38:36.711 --> 38:38.312
Can you hear me?

38:40.911 --> 38:42.363
Whoever's listening to me right now,

38:42.431 --> 38:44.806
I know you're there...
Fischer showed me the bug.

38:44.874 --> 38:49.309
So why don't you just stop wasting
everyone's time and talk to me?

38:49.389 --> 38:51.323
I'm right here.

38:52.805 --> 38:54.906
All you gotta do is call.

39:02.983 --> 39:04.850
(phone ringing)

39:09.225 --> 39:11.088
- It's not right.
- It isn't up to you, Kurt.

39:11.156 --> 39:11.673
It is none of your

39:11.741 --> 39:12.776
- damn business who I date.
- It is, Sarah.

39:12.844 --> 39:14.514
- If it's Reade, it is, okay?
- I don't need you

39:14.582 --> 39:15.630
- playing protective older brother,
- He works with me!

39:15.698 --> 39:16.685
- so thanks.
- I'm not.

39:16.753 --> 39:17.439
Yes, you are.

39:17.507 --> 39:18.431
I'm not in the way that you think.

39:18.499 --> 39:19.702
Then enlighten me, please.

39:19.770 --> 39:22.107
We've got so much loss in our lives.

39:22.175 --> 39:25.096
Our mom... Taylor.

39:25.164 --> 39:26.948
And Dad's sick.

39:27.097 --> 39:28.683
I spoke to Reade.

39:28.856 --> 39:30.448
He told me things were serious.

39:30.516 --> 39:32.008
- If it's true...
- It is.

39:32.076 --> 39:34.155
Do you know how dangerous my job is?

39:34.223 --> 39:36.087
- The risks that I have to take?
- Kurt...

39:36.155 --> 39:37.899
Reade's job is exactly the same.

39:37.967 --> 39:42.797
The last thing that I
want is you or Sawyer...

39:43.068 --> 39:44.211
to lose someone that you love.

39:44.279 --> 39:46.146
Kurt, you don't need to protect everyone...

39:46.214 --> 39:47.810
- That's my point, Sarah!
- What is your...

39:47.878 --> 39:49.482
I can't protect everyone!

39:49.550 --> 39:51.373
Do you know how much it takes?!

39:51.450 --> 39:53.219
It takes all of me!

39:53.576 --> 39:55.855
It takes everything from me!

40:01.254 --> 40:03.176
Kurt, what's going on?

40:09.066 --> 40:11.361
I'm not angry at you. Okay?

40:11.446 --> 40:13.380
I'm sorry if I woke him up.

40:18.473 --> 40:20.374
(man) You made it.

40:21.470 --> 40:25.073
Do you have any idea what
kind of danger I was in today?

40:27.127 --> 40:28.792
_

40:29.215 --> 40:30.256
_

40:30.324 --> 40:31.952
What is that, Russian?

40:32.020 --> 40:35.278
I don't know anything about
you except for what you tell me.

40:35.346 --> 40:37.689
And what you tell me, I can't trust.

40:37.757 --> 40:40.199
- Who do you work for?
- You know who I work for.

40:40.267 --> 40:41.964
No, enough of all this circular...

40:42.032 --> 40:43.529
I was almost caught today.

40:43.597 --> 40:45.979
- By Weller?
- No, by an OPR agent

40:46.047 --> 40:48.280
who accused me of being a Russian mole.

40:48.348 --> 40:50.282
And for killing Carter.

40:50.350 --> 40:52.037
Now, he didn't have all the pieces right,

40:52.105 --> 40:53.236
but he didn't have 'em all wrong either,

40:53.304 --> 40:54.567
- and do you wanna know why?
- Wait...

40:54.635 --> 40:56.444
Because I am a mole!

40:56.512 --> 40:59.869
And I am responsible for Carter's murder.

40:59.937 --> 41:02.904
You may have killed him,
but I... I am the reason why.

41:02.972 --> 41:07.559
This... this OPR agent...
what happened to him?

41:07.627 --> 41:09.951
I killed him.

41:10.351 --> 41:12.688
You know exactly who you're working for.

41:12.756 --> 41:14.579
No, it was not like that.

41:14.647 --> 41:16.016
I... I had to.

41:16.084 --> 41:18.264
Whether you did or didn't,

41:18.332 --> 41:20.159
you're one of us.

41:20.227 --> 41:22.251
He would've kept digging, and...

41:22.319 --> 41:23.598
he was reaching for his gun.

41:23.666 --> 41:25.854
And now your secret's safe again.

41:26.006 --> 41:28.594
And we live to fight another day.

41:31.501 --> 41:34.228
I have a time-sensitive tattoo I
need you to bring to their attention.

41:34.296 --> 41:35.969
No.

41:36.037 --> 41:37.425
I don't think you understand.

41:37.493 --> 41:38.894
I'm done.

41:40.097 --> 41:41.674
I'm out.

41:43.639 --> 41:45.116
Taylor!

41:48.592 --> 41:49.703
You're here late.

41:49.771 --> 41:51.102
You got a minute?

41:51.226 --> 41:53.227
Close the door.

41:55.951 --> 41:58.445
Everything that happened today got me...

42:00.512 --> 42:02.046
I just don't wanna go over Weller's head.

42:02.114 --> 42:05.010
Reade, it's late. Out with it.

42:05.078 --> 42:07.600
Circumstantial evidence is still evidence,

42:07.668 --> 42:10.870
and Fischer's case against
Jane wasn't all that crazy.

42:10.938 --> 42:12.350
Just because she's not a Russian spy

42:12.418 --> 42:14.664
doesn't mean she didn't kill Carter.

42:14.732 --> 42:16.690
Where was she that night?

42:16.758 --> 42:20.234
Because I've got some major
reservations about Jane's alibi.

42:20.670 --> 42:22.103
Me, too.

42:24.178 --> 42:26.077
The question now is,

42:26.145 --> 42:28.246
what are we gonna do about it?
