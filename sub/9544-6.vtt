00:24.805 --> 00:27.795
Do you want to wait here or...
meet me inside?

00:27.830 --> 00:30.203
Uh.. um..

00:30.238 --> 00:33.123
I...I will say no.

00:33.158 --> 00:38.270
- Why don't you just come with me?
- No.. uh.. down there?

00:38.305 --> 00:44.215
I'm not, not good with garage.
It's so, garage like.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.935
Why do you have to go the bank? Why
can't you just use one of those machines?

00:47.970 --> 00:51.279
- Because I lost ATM card.
- I thought you just lost your check book.

00:51.314 --> 00:54.683
Yes. And I also lost address book.

00:56.608 --> 00:59.919
You'll stay here, I'll be
back in 5 minutes, ok?

02:09.840 --> 02:11.203
Sharona.

02:13.897 --> 02:17.279
- Douglas is worried about you.
- Oh, my god!

02:26.961 --> 02:29.231
We need a paramedic!
He had multiple stab wounds.

02:30.205 --> 02:32.514
The parking garage
on 10th and Van ness.

02:32.549 --> 02:34.963
- He's been stabbed?
- Yes, I think he's dead!

02:34.998 --> 02:37.460
And he said my name.
He's right over here.

02:40.081 --> 02:41.708
What?

02:49.937 --> 02:52.593
I'm telling you,
he was right here!

02:56.315 --> 02:58.728
MONK Season 3 Epi. 06
Mr. Monk and the Girl Who Cried Wolf

04:05.976 --> 04:09.131
- Anything?
- Captain, I'm not a rocket scientist,

04:09.166 --> 04:12.036
but I think I know whether or not
there's a body in the room.

04:17.571 --> 04:21.127
- Hey, here you go.
- Thanks.

04:22.120 --> 04:26.229
So listen, I got to file a report here.
You understand, right?

04:28.448 --> 04:30.612
This man you saw...

04:30.647 --> 04:33.861
he was, what, medium build,
about 30 years old?

04:33.896 --> 04:35.990
Maybe 35.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.670
And he was wearing boots
and a cowboy shirt.

04:39.705 --> 04:42.213
And he, uh, had a knife in his chest.

04:42.248 --> 04:45.413
Yeah, and a screwdriver in his ear.

04:45.448 --> 04:48.454
Flat head or Phillips head?

04:48.489 --> 04:50.315
Sorry.

04:53.638 --> 04:58.438
And this guy, he called
you by your name. - Yep.

04:58.473 --> 05:00.649
I mean, did he say anything else?

05:00.684 --> 05:04.321
- "Douglas is worried about you."
- "Douglas is worried about you."

05:04.356 --> 05:05.933
Who's Douglas?

05:07.154 --> 05:09.500
Douglas was my father's name.

05:10.034 --> 05:12.053
Well, where's he now?

05:12.088 --> 05:14.500
He's been dead for 20 years.

05:17.917 --> 05:21.093
The luminol tests are negative.
There is no sign of blood.

05:21.128 --> 05:23.621
Well, maybe whoever killed
the guy, cleaned up.

05:24.579 --> 05:27.304
What, in two minutes,
and got rid of a body?

05:27.339 --> 05:29.044
Even you couldn't do that.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.017
Look at the windshield.

05:33.237 --> 05:35.478
Okay, what about it?

05:35.513 --> 05:40.160
There were four dead bugs on that
windshield in the shape of a trapezoid.

05:40.195 --> 05:43.647
- A trapezoid.
- Yeah. They've been there all day.

05:43.682 --> 05:45.433
Somebody wiped it off.

05:45.468 --> 05:47.095
Well, maybe she wiped it off.

05:47.130 --> 05:49.746
- Why would she do that?
- You tell me.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.873
Look, Monk, you're the best
on-site detective I know.

05:52.908 --> 05:54.475
Do you see anything here,

05:54.510 --> 05:58.523
anything at all besides
the missing trapezoid bugs...

05:58.558 --> 06:00.749
to corroborate her story?

06:04.459 --> 06:08.228
I'm not at my best
in parking garages.

06:10.042 --> 06:12.513
Oh. Trudy.
I'm sorry.

06:17.563 --> 06:19.393
Look, I don't know what to think.

06:19.428 --> 06:22.481
Sharona has been
under a lot of stress.

06:22.516 --> 06:26.578
She's been losing things.
She's been forgetting appointments.

06:26.613 --> 06:28.515
Maybe she needs some time off.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.873
- From what?
- From you.

06:32.209 --> 06:35.244
Monk, that lady's got the most
stressful job in North america.

06:35.279 --> 06:38.731
I know guys on the bomb squad,
tough as nails, nerves of steel,

06:38.766 --> 06:42.677
that couldn't work for you.
They'd have cracked four years ago.

06:42.712 --> 06:44.703
I'd say give her a break.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.165
A week off with pay.
Send her home.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.478
There, case closed.

06:54.529 --> 06:56.970
Well, I can't believe you've
never played dominos before.

06:57.005 --> 06:58.389
Me neither.

07:00.611 --> 07:02.760
That's the last one.
We did it.

07:02.795 --> 07:04.130
Hold it.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.038
- Okay.
- All right. - Good job.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.736
- Now the best part.
- I know. I know.

07:13.771 --> 07:16.952
I've been waiting for this.
Okay, on your mark...

07:17.462 --> 07:20.783
Get set...
Go!

07:22.055 --> 07:24.130
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, what are you doing?

07:24.165 --> 07:25.921
Putting them away.
Hey, watch this.

07:25.956 --> 07:27.243
Two at a time.

07:27.278 --> 07:29.480
No, no, no. You're supposed
to knock them down.

07:29.515 --> 07:30.969
What? - You're supposed
to knock them over.

07:31.004 --> 07:34.595
No, no, wait, wait, wait,
Benjy, Benjy, Benjamin.

07:34.630 --> 07:38.600
No, no, see, if, if you
knock that one over,

07:38.635 --> 07:41.564
then they're all going to go.

07:41.599 --> 07:44.295
And then, then you
have a giant mess.

07:44.330 --> 07:45.884
Thank god I was here.

07:45.919 --> 07:49.485
Let's put them away.
This is fun. - But, you know...

07:49.520 --> 07:52.487
Hey, hey. Let's put
them away in order.

07:52.522 --> 07:55.126
- Here. Here's a 2 dotter.
- Fine.

07:55.161 --> 07:56.904
Looking for all the 2 dotters.

07:56.939 --> 07:58.838
Hey, Benjy, listen, I'm going
to be back in two hours,

07:58.873 --> 08:01.584
and there's no TV until
you do your homework, okay?

08:01.619 --> 08:04.150
All right, now my...

08:04.185 --> 08:06.134
my wallet...

08:06.169 --> 08:08.962
keys...

08:08.997 --> 08:11.130
the window.

08:14.175 --> 08:15.301
Adrian, can you get
this window for me?

08:15.336 --> 08:17.567
- Because I'm, I'm running late.
- Sure.

08:18.128 --> 08:20.604
- How's your class going?
- Great.

08:20.639 --> 08:22.135
I used to write all the
time in high school,

08:22.170 --> 08:27.134
but I, I think it's very important
that I have a creative outlet, you know?

08:27.169 --> 08:30.224
Something to express myself.

08:30.259 --> 08:33.284
So, uh, when are you
coming back to work?

08:34.054 --> 08:37.280
Um...
Tomorrow.

08:37.315 --> 08:39.832
- Tomorrow. Really?
- Yeah.

08:43.828 --> 08:46.841
Adrian, I really appreciate
the time off.

08:48.321 --> 08:51.491
And, uh, listen...

08:51.526 --> 08:55.746
I know you were worried about me,
but it was so real.

08:55.781 --> 08:59.427
His face, the blood...

08:59.462 --> 09:01.807
it's not going to happen again.

09:02.220 --> 09:03.640
All right.

09:03.675 --> 09:08.149
Benjy, be good.
Listen to him, okay? - Okay.

09:16.612 --> 09:19.952
I can't believe she actually
likes going to school.

09:19.987 --> 09:23.330
She stays up all night writing
her stories. - What kind of stories?

09:23.365 --> 09:25.577
I don't know.
She doesn't let me read them.

09:25.612 --> 09:28.087
I saw the name of one, though.

09:28.122 --> 09:29.913
- "The fatal recipe."
- Yeah.

09:29.948 --> 09:31.848
I think it's a mystery.

09:35.585 --> 09:37.670
Stop! stop!

09:37.705 --> 09:39.806
Benjy, stop,
stop it. stop it.

09:40.003 --> 09:42.003
Stop!

09:45.603 --> 09:46.871
Oh...

09:49.148 --> 09:50.649
Stop!

09:54.657 --> 09:56.603
What have we done?

09:58.586 --> 10:02.840
Gandoroh watched the pilgrims of
Zenlahf enter the valley below.

10:02.875 --> 10:06.372
He saluted them
with his robotic right arm.

10:06.407 --> 10:09.998
In his left arm he held
the cloak of invisibility,

10:10.033 --> 10:14.236
while he slipped his middle
arm behind his back

10:14.271 --> 10:19.206
to pull the final arrow
from his quiver.

10:19.241 --> 10:20.772
The end.

10:20.807 --> 10:23.775
Thank you, Billy.
That was very vivid.

10:23.810 --> 10:26.564
- Any questions or comments?
- Yeah, I got a question.

10:26.599 --> 10:30.473
Who do I see about getting
the last 15 minutes of my life back?

10:30.508 --> 10:34.551
For your information, Varla, fantasy
fiction is very hot right now, okay?

10:34.586 --> 10:37.036
For your information,
you're delusional.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.923
You know what I do all day?
I'm a nurse. I know sick when I see it,

10:39.958 --> 10:42.465
and this is one sad,
sick, geeky puppy.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.866
Varla, please, no negatives.

10:44.901 --> 10:49.180
We are here to support each other
and respect each other.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.575
Okay.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.936
Here are your papers
from last week.

10:52.971 --> 10:55.539
Eddie, very good.

10:55.574 --> 10:57.881
Rita, love the metaphor.

10:57.916 --> 11:01.081
George, not bad.

11:01.116 --> 11:03.483
Varla...

11:03.518 --> 11:07.607
A B-? Oh, we're going
to have to talk about this.

11:08.740 --> 11:10.543
Okay, um,

11:10.578 --> 11:13.438
continue to work on your papers.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.991
Remember to write
your first draft by hand.

11:17.026 --> 11:20.221
Just let it flow.
I will see you all Wednesday.

11:24.079 --> 11:25.744
- Um, Ms. Preminger?
- Yes?

11:25.779 --> 11:29.531
- I didn't get my paper.
- Sharona, you didn't turn one in.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.789
What? Yeah, I did. I, I gave it
to you on Wednesday.

11:33.824 --> 11:35.411
I was going to mention that, actually,

11:35.446 --> 11:38.342
but I just assumed you didn't finish
and you'd turn it in later.

11:38.377 --> 11:41.172
No. no, no, no.
I, I handed it in.

11:41.207 --> 11:43.795
I, you were looking at it.

11:43.830 --> 11:47.804
Did you check your car?
Maybe it fell between the seats?

11:49.807 --> 11:53.074
No. I...

11:54.306 --> 11:57.474
Sharona, are you okay?

12:23.671 --> 12:26.187
Oh, my god!

12:36.147 --> 12:38.117
You know, it's a confusing time,

12:38.152 --> 12:41.377
not just for you, but for everyone.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.287
It's hard to feel centered.

12:43.322 --> 12:46.738
These days, it's hard to even
know where the center is.

12:46.773 --> 12:49.071
what are you feeling right now?

12:52.968 --> 12:55.852
Well, I feel weird being here...

12:55.887 --> 12:58.859
like I'm trespassing.

13:01.584 --> 13:04.857
I bet those pillows
must drive him crazy, huh?

13:05.750 --> 13:08.271
I'm not at liberty to say.

13:11.720 --> 13:15.475
Well, I see my window is
cleaner than your window.

13:15.510 --> 13:17.143
That's got to be him.

13:17.178 --> 13:19.441
Sometimes I wish that we
could switch seats,

13:19.476 --> 13:22.014
So I could get
this window a little...

13:23.447 --> 13:25.833
You, you said that, um,

13:25.868 --> 13:29.064
You've been, what,
losing things, right?

13:30.070 --> 13:32.250
Besides my sanity?

13:37.581 --> 13:40.085
Look...

13:40.120 --> 13:42.575
I thought I handed in a paper at school,

13:42.610 --> 13:44.968
and it turned out I didn't.

13:45.003 --> 13:47.230
That happens.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.402
Okay, well, last week...

13:49.437 --> 13:51.891
I found a remote control
in the freezer.

13:51.926 --> 13:54.212
4 days ago, my car keys
are in the basement,

13:54.247 --> 13:56.698
And I haven't been down
there in months.

14:02.812 --> 14:04.912
Are you next?

14:04.947 --> 14:07.739
I'm just waiting for a friend.

14:07.774 --> 14:09.990
I've never been here
on Tuesday before.

14:10.981 --> 14:12.699
I'm here on Mondays...

14:14.130 --> 14:16.251
And Fridays.

14:17.874 --> 14:21.429
And every other Wednesday.

14:34.796 --> 14:36.506
What do you think of the new
white noise machine?

14:36.541 --> 14:39.983
I don't like it.
It's half-decibel louder.

14:40.018 --> 14:42.932
Exactly. - Yeah.

14:49.317 --> 14:52.795
How do you feel when,
when you lose something?

14:54.339 --> 14:58.022
Scared...
But I can't show it because of Benjy.

14:58.057 --> 15:00.676
Okay, what, what are you afraid of?

15:01.832 --> 15:05.378
That I'm falling apart...

15:05.413 --> 15:07.053
like my father.

15:07.088 --> 15:09.173
Tell me about that.

15:15.748 --> 15:20.628
My father was a very active man.

15:20.663 --> 15:24.850
Because he owned a hardware
store back in Jersey,

15:24.885 --> 15:30.947
and, um, one morning,
he never came downstairs.

15:30.982 --> 15:33.443
He wouldn't get out of bed.
He said he couldn't.

15:33.478 --> 15:36.196
He said he was too tired.

15:36.231 --> 15:42.000
And he never got out of bed...

15:42.035 --> 15:45.294
and my mother had sold the store.

15:47.477 --> 15:51.753
- I'm sorry.
- Everybody was sorry.

15:53.766 --> 15:56.928
And then he ended up in the hospital.

15:56.963 --> 16:02.085
Everybody called it a rest home,
but I knew what that really was.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.727
So...

16:05.762 --> 16:09.949
you know what? All,
all I can remember...

16:09.984 --> 16:13.629
was that, that his room was
this ugly blue color,

16:13.664 --> 16:17.951
and that it smelled like fish,

16:17.986 --> 16:23.714
and that's where he died in that room.

16:23.749 --> 16:29.270
I was 12 at that time and...

16:29.305 --> 16:36.043
Oh, that's how old Benjy is.

16:36.078 --> 16:40.891
I swear to god, if I have a breakdown,
I am never going to forgive him.

16:41.614 --> 16:44.008
Your father?

16:44.043 --> 16:46.185
Adrian.

16:46.980 --> 16:49.686
Sharona, you're, you're not...

16:49.721 --> 16:52.655
you're not saying that Adrian
is responsible for this.

16:52.690 --> 16:56.231
You're a nurse. You know
he's not contagious.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.247
Look, I am with him all day,

16:59.282 --> 17:03.467
and all I know is that
I was fine before I met him.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.139
what are you doing?

17:52.003 --> 17:53.958
Just making them even...

17:53.993 --> 17:58.384
two, two...
and two.

17:59.419 --> 18:02.882
- That's the way Dr. Kroger likes it.
- Did he tell you that?

18:03.637 --> 18:06.188
I didn't think so.

18:06.223 --> 18:08.132
No, Dr. Kroger and I have a system.

18:08.167 --> 18:11.490
We, we arrange them by titles.

18:15.702 --> 18:17.753
I don't think so.

18:17.788 --> 18:20.363
So this is why I have to
fix it every time I come in.

18:20.398 --> 18:22.404
I was just about to say
the same thing.

18:22.439 --> 18:24.664
- Right up here.
- Stop acting like a child now.

18:24.699 --> 18:27.086
You are being ridiculous.
You are spiraling...

18:27.121 --> 18:29.056
Not only do you have
serious control issues,

18:29.091 --> 18:31.248
- you're a pathological liar.
- Well, you are a fool.

18:31.283 --> 18:35.169
Because I know, I have known Dr. Kroger
for a much longer time than you.

18:35.204 --> 18:36.547
Don't drop it on the floor!

18:36.582 --> 18:39.468
Well, now, now we have to throw it out.

18:39.503 --> 18:42.139
You're being ridiculous.
This goes up here.

18:42.174 --> 18:44.103
- You're very selfish.
- Harold, Harold...

18:44.138 --> 18:46.522
Dr. Kroger, he keeps
messing up our system.

18:46.557 --> 18:47.811
It has to be even.
We always make them even.

18:47.846 --> 18:50.641
- You need help, buddy.
- Adrian! Harold!

18:50.676 --> 18:53.489
When you're in your own homes, you can
arrange everything just the way you'd like.

18:53.524 --> 18:55.606
This happens to be my office.

18:55.641 --> 18:58.850
If things are a little messy,
I like it that way.

18:58.885 --> 19:01.274
I hope you'll both respect that.

19:01.309 --> 19:03.567
Harold, would you like to step in?
I'll be with you in a minute.

19:03.602 --> 19:04.906
Yes, why don't you go in the office now?

19:04.907 --> 19:06.666
Adrian, I'll take care
of it from here. Thank you.

19:06.701 --> 19:09.891
Harold, go in the office.
I'll be there in a second.

19:09.926 --> 19:13.877
- Thank you, Harold.
- I'll see you in hell, Harold. - Adrian.

19:13.912 --> 19:15.208
Sharona, that was
a very good start.

19:15.243 --> 19:19.801
I'll see you on Thursday. Harold!
Thank you. Adrian.

19:19.836 --> 19:21.497
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.550
How was it in there?

19:27.585 --> 19:29.449
I don't want to talk about it.

19:32.270 --> 19:34.089
I'm going to go wash up.

19:47.996 --> 19:52.786
You can get through this.
You can get through this.

19:57.633 --> 20:00.120
Oh, my god.

20:14.649 --> 20:18.029
- Daddy needs you.
- Oh, my god!

20:20.931 --> 20:23.769
Adrian, I...

20:30.294 --> 20:35.085
He, he was right there.
Look, Check the stall.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.511
- I, I'd rather not check the stall.
- Check the stall!

20:36.546 --> 20:39.797
All right.
I'll check the stall.

20:51.669 --> 20:54.350
Oh, god.

21:01.450 --> 21:05.269
I remember when bathroom walls were
for phone numbers and dirty limericks.

21:05.304 --> 21:08.189
And funny drawings of your
commanding officer.

21:08.224 --> 21:10.082
What drawings?

21:12.771 --> 21:14.650
Like that?

21:15.102 --> 21:16.614
I don't know.

21:16.649 --> 21:19.086
Maybe the eyebrows were
a little bit thicker.

21:20.080 --> 21:21.998
Mm, like that.

21:22.624 --> 21:24.783
Maybe. I, I don't know.

21:24.818 --> 21:26.880
So what do you think?

21:26.915 --> 21:29.548
- I want to believe her.
- Well, I want to believe her, too,

21:29.583 --> 21:31.264
but that's not what I asked you.

21:31.299 --> 21:32.684
I don't know.

21:32.719 --> 21:35.618
Maybe I'm too close to it,
like I am with the Trudy case.

21:35.653 --> 21:39.150
- There is zero physical evidence.
- There was the hook in the ceiling.

21:39.185 --> 21:42.390
We checked it, Monk.
It was always there.

21:58.336 --> 22:01.175
There it is.
Right there.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.045
This?

22:08.144 --> 22:10.568
Oh, that's a perfect match.

22:10.603 --> 22:12.331
What's that white stuff?

22:12.366 --> 22:14.779
- Plaster...
- from the wall.

22:14.814 --> 22:17.453
Well, now we know what
"help me" means.

22:39.961 --> 22:42.008
Sharona...

22:44.489 --> 22:47.454
Adrian...

22:47.489 --> 22:50.975
I can't take care of you anymore.

22:51.010 --> 22:55.385
What? - Look, I have to take
some time off, okay?

22:55.420 --> 22:59.020
Now, I just called a really good friend
of mine who's a registered nurse,

22:59.055 --> 23:01.099
and she's going to fill in for me.

23:01.134 --> 23:03.499
What's she like?

23:16.037 --> 23:18.694
- Are you Adam?
- Uh, no.

23:18.729 --> 23:21.049
Wait. Hold on. Anthony.

23:21.084 --> 23:23.499
- Adrian.
- No, that's not it.

23:23.534 --> 23:25.627
Shoot, I can't read
my own handwriting.

23:25.662 --> 23:27.889
It's Adrian.
I'm pretty sure.

23:27.924 --> 23:31.499
Hold on.
A, adrian.

23:31.534 --> 23:32.678
You were right.

23:32.713 --> 23:35.919
I'm Varla, Sharona's friend
from her writing class.

23:35.954 --> 23:40.226
- She told you I was coming, right?
- Well, um...

23:40.261 --> 23:42.385
- uh...
- what are you looking at?

23:42.420 --> 23:44.605
My eyes are up here.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.280
I, uh, no. Uh, no, I wasn't...

23:46.315 --> 23:48.359
What's a Monk doing
looking at my breasts?

23:48.394 --> 23:51.437
I'm not a Monk.
My name is Monk.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.832
My boyfriend teaches kickboxing.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.668
You don't want to be
messing with me.

23:55.703 --> 23:59.495
- Uh, are you a nurse or...
- I'm not just a nurse.

23:59.530 --> 24:01.335
Honey, I'm your nurse.

24:01.370 --> 24:03.129
And I got to pee.
Hold my note.

24:03.164 --> 24:05.000
Got to go make my bladder gladder.

24:05.035 --> 24:07.420
Not, not, not, no.
No, please, don't.

24:07.455 --> 24:11.556
That, not really a public...
restroom.

24:41.639 --> 24:42.960
What do you want from me?

24:42.995 --> 24:44.240
I have a knife!

24:44.275 --> 24:45.972
Hey.

24:46.007 --> 24:48.183
You don't recognize your
own ex-husband?

24:49.475 --> 24:50.834
Trevor.

24:50.869 --> 24:53.887
You scared me half to death.
How did you get in here?

24:53.922 --> 24:56.388
You still hide your spare
keys above the door.

24:57.777 --> 25:01.903
Well, you just can't come walking
into my house like this, okay?

25:01.938 --> 25:03.847
I'm waiting for Benjy.

25:03.882 --> 25:07.467
- He called me.
- Benjy called you?

25:07.502 --> 25:09.520
He said he was worried about you.

25:11.809 --> 25:15.576
Well, you're wasting your time.
You should go back to Jersey.

25:15.611 --> 25:17.358
We're fine.

25:18.158 --> 25:20.278
Are you?

25:22.951 --> 25:25.868
I'm going to need a list of your meds
and the proper dosages.

25:25.903 --> 25:28.620
- Don't take any medication.
- What the hell am I doing here, then?

25:28.655 --> 25:30.883
I have, I just need a little help.

25:30.918 --> 25:33.925
- Doing what?
- Everything.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.780
I'm hungry.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.986
What's in here?

25:42.021 --> 25:44.654
- Shoes?
- No, that's my food.

25:44.689 --> 25:46.810
I keep it all airtight containers.

25:46.845 --> 25:49.691
It's in a certain order.
It's color-coded.

25:49.726 --> 25:51.988
There's a chart on the inside
of the door here.

25:52.023 --> 25:54.021
What's in this one?

25:54.056 --> 25:56.707
- Turkey?
- That's for you.

25:56.742 --> 25:58.987
For me?
You didn't even know I was coming.

25:59.022 --> 26:02.193
I know, but it's yours now.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.622
No meds, huh?

26:03.657 --> 26:07.919
Sharona wanted me to,
to give you this.

26:10.795 --> 26:12.929
What's on?

26:12.964 --> 26:16.964
Adrian monk, care and feeding.
Special diet, he's got phobias.

26:16.999 --> 26:19.432
Heights, germs, snakes,
crowds, milk...

26:19.467 --> 26:21.014
you're afraid of milk?

26:21.049 --> 26:22.887
How old are you, man?

26:22.922 --> 26:25.777
I got a 2 year old nephew
who's not afraid of milk.

26:25.812 --> 26:29.451
- You must be very proud of him.
- For what, not being afraid of milk?

26:29.486 --> 26:30.864
That just mean she's normal.

26:30.899 --> 26:33.111
You don't need this.

26:33.146 --> 26:35.147
Sharona's a good nurse,

26:35.182 --> 26:38.410
but she's been treating
you like a baby.

26:38.445 --> 26:40.685
The party is over, Adrian monk,

26:40.720 --> 26:43.775
Because I'm going to
treat you like a man.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.154
Don't do that.

26:46.189 --> 26:47.986
And since we're going to be
together for two weeks,

26:48.021 --> 26:50.134
there's a few things
you need to know, - No, no, no.

26:50.169 --> 26:54.507
all right? I get a hour for lunch
by myself with a TV.

26:54.542 --> 26:56.723
Okay, by 5:30, what?

26:56.758 --> 26:59.589
In my car driving away waving goodbye.

26:59.624 --> 27:01.003
I get weekends off.

27:01.038 --> 27:02.962
Don't call me at home
unless it's an emergency,

27:02.997 --> 27:06.842
which it won't be,
so don't ever call me.

27:06.877 --> 27:08.406
- Yeah.
- There you go again,

27:08.441 --> 27:10.938
- looking at my chest.
- No, no, I'm...

27:10.973 --> 27:14.764
Touch me again and I'm going to smack you
so hard, even your children will feel it.

27:14.799 --> 27:19.776
- Now, where you keep the chips?
- I don't, I don't have any children.

27:19.811 --> 27:24.161
Um, Trudy and I talked
about it, but, uh...

27:24.196 --> 27:26.467
Oh, shoot,
there's a crumb.

27:27.201 --> 27:29.120
So how's Sharona, anyway?

27:29.155 --> 27:32.129
I, I don't know. Uh...

27:32.164 --> 27:36.959
- I was just going to call her, though.
- I'm worried about that girl.

27:36.994 --> 27:39.546
I have never seen anybody
fall apart that fast.

27:39.581 --> 27:42.440
Really? - I used to work
in the psycho wards.

27:42.475 --> 27:45.178
Nobody starts hallucinating overnight,

27:45.213 --> 27:47.033
unless they've been
chewing on mushrooms.

27:47.068 --> 27:49.253
But with Sharona, there were
no warning signs at all.

27:49.288 --> 27:51.670
It just doesn't make sense.

27:51.705 --> 27:54.025
- You're right.
- I know I'm right.

27:54.060 --> 27:56.361
I don't need you
to tell me I'm right.

27:56.396 --> 27:59.725
- What are you doing?
- I want to check something out.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.792
That's what I do.
You come with me.

28:01.827 --> 28:03.919
- What?
- It's part of the job.

28:03.954 --> 28:06.552
I'm a detective,
and you are my helper.

28:06.587 --> 28:08.903
I'm your what?

28:10.946 --> 28:14.879
- Ms. Preminger.
- Oh, Sharona.

28:14.914 --> 28:18.473
Thank you for coming.
I wanted to talk to you in person.

28:18.508 --> 28:20.316
Are you really dropping my class?

28:20.351 --> 28:23.134
Yeah. I'm sorry.

28:23.169 --> 28:25.253
Was, was it something
I did or said?

28:25.288 --> 28:28.974
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You, you've been great. I...

28:29.009 --> 28:31.223
I just have some personal issues.

28:31.258 --> 28:35.604
Sharona, promise me that
you will continue to write.

28:35.639 --> 28:39.485
You have such a unique voice,
and I don't say that to everybody.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.278
That essay you wrote
about your father...

28:42.313 --> 28:47.175
- I cried when I read that.
- Thanks.

28:47.210 --> 28:49.332
Well, if you go to the
registrar's office, you might

28:49.333 --> 28:51.293
be able to get a partial
refund on your tuition.

28:53.085 --> 28:55.420
Sharona?

28:55.455 --> 28:57.697
Sharona, are you okay?

28:57.732 --> 29:02.913
There's somebody outside the window.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.185
Where?

29:21.224 --> 29:25.570
You know, I'm...
I'm just really tired.

29:25.605 --> 29:31.254
Ms., Um,
thanks for everything.

29:48.437 --> 29:50.727
You're going to have to take
care of Benjy for a little while.

29:51.819 --> 29:55.013
- Since when?
- Since now.

29:58.895 --> 30:01.159
Hey, don't give me that look.

30:01.194 --> 30:04.235
You didn't win anything.
This isn't about custody.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.811
This is about what's doing
best for Benjy right now,

30:06.846 --> 30:09.654
and when I'm feeling more up to it,

30:09.689 --> 30:11.620
he's going to come back with me.

30:11.655 --> 30:13.744
Right?

30:15.700 --> 30:19.203
She parks the car here.

30:19.238 --> 30:22.542
She gets out, come on.
You be her.

30:23.755 --> 30:27.383
Screwdriver man appears.

30:30.091 --> 30:33.449
He walks toward her.

31:05.246 --> 31:06.863
What is it?

31:08.432 --> 31:10.527
Is that a clue?

31:16.391 --> 31:19.809
It's a silver tip from a cowboy boot.

31:21.938 --> 31:25.370
Sharona said he was
wearing cowboy boots.

31:25.405 --> 31:28.087
Ooh, may it was Garth brooks.

31:28.122 --> 31:32.627
There. I solved the case.

31:32.662 --> 31:34.287
What?

31:34.322 --> 31:36.733
Am I right about Garth brooks?

31:39.606 --> 31:42.950
She wasn't hallucinating.

31:42.985 --> 31:45.203
He was here.

31:45.870 --> 31:50.212
- Wipe.
- Wipe what?

31:51.350 --> 31:54.206
When I say "wipe,"
you give me a handwipe.

31:54.241 --> 31:55.474
That's how it works.

31:55.509 --> 31:59.895
That's how what works? - It.

31:59.930 --> 32:04.554
You better get over it real fast.

32:16.580 --> 32:18.266
Is this home made?

32:29.802 --> 32:32.940
- Don't you have a class?
- I'm taking the night off.

32:32.975 --> 32:36.822
- That's a first.
- How would you know?

32:36.857 --> 32:40.281
You'd have to be paying attention
to know something like that.

32:43.359 --> 32:45.322
Meredith...

32:45.357 --> 32:47.556
let's don't start.

32:51.108 --> 32:52.950
Are you sick?

32:52.985 --> 32:55.163
No. But you are.

32:55.198 --> 32:57.958
In fact...

32:57.993 --> 33:02.829
I'll be calling the paramedics
in about 2 and half to 3 minutes.

33:08.743 --> 33:11.122
What for?

33:11.157 --> 33:15.338
Maxwell, You're going
to have a heart attack.

33:24.580 --> 33:28.718
Right on time...
as always.

33:36.587 --> 33:38.006
Oh, he's dead.

33:38.793 --> 33:42.151
He's been dead for a long time.
He just didn't know it.

33:42.186 --> 33:45.219
- This wine OK?
- Oh, no. Wine's fine.

33:45.254 --> 33:47.114
It was just in the soup.

33:47.149 --> 33:50.517
To our partner, Sharona fleming.

33:50.552 --> 33:53.264
We couldn't have done it without her.

34:13.315 --> 34:16.255
Sharona!
Great news!

34:16.290 --> 34:17.571
Hey, you're not going
to believe it.

34:17.606 --> 34:19.283
What, what happened here?

34:19.318 --> 34:21.129
Nothing. It fell.
What is it?

34:21.164 --> 34:22.313
Aw, let me help you.

34:22.348 --> 34:24.636
- What, what is it?
- One second.

34:24.670 --> 34:26.706
Hey, coconut,

34:26.742 --> 34:29.458
you were talking to the lady.
Finish what you were saying.

34:30.598 --> 34:32.969
- You're not crazy.
-What?

34:33.005 --> 34:34.572
You are not crazy.

34:34.608 --> 34:36.574
You might want a second opinion.

34:36.610 --> 34:39.639
This man's not exactly
an expert on not crazy.

34:39.675 --> 34:41.606
Why didn't you tell me
he thinks he's Kojak?

34:41.641 --> 34:46.007
A friend has an obligation to tell another
friend when somebody think he's Kojak.

34:46.043 --> 34:48.620
- I'm sorry.
- What is all this paper?

34:48.655 --> 34:50.547
It's scrap paper.
I use it for packing.

34:50.581 --> 34:54.456
- Well, it's all crumpled now.
- It's supposed to be crumpled.

34:54.492 --> 34:57.627
He's not on meds?
Honey, he was made for meds.

34:57.662 --> 35:01.094
Hey, let me do this.
You talk to her.

35:03.316 --> 35:06.987
I went back to the garage.
I found a boot tip.

35:07.022 --> 35:10.219
Kojak and I were very excited
about that boot tip.

35:10.254 --> 35:12.747
There is a shoe repair shop
on Lark avenue

35:12.782 --> 35:16.324
that replaced a tip on
a cowboy boot last monday.

35:16.359 --> 35:20.595
The customer's name
was Denny graf.

35:20.630 --> 35:24.191
Does it mean anything
to you? - No.

35:24.226 --> 35:27.903
Well, he's a security guard
at the community college.

35:27.938 --> 35:29.419
My college?

35:29.454 --> 35:31.239
That mystery story that you wrote,

35:31.274 --> 35:34.984
"the fatal recipe",
what was the plot?

35:35.019 --> 35:36.792
Well, it's about a woman who kills her

35:36.793 --> 35:39.031
husband and makes it
look like a heart attack.

35:39.784 --> 35:42.630
Mrs. Preminger canceled
her class last night...

35:42.665 --> 35:47.079
because her husband Max
died of a heart attack.

35:47.114 --> 35:51.827
- Right after he ate some tomato soup.
- Oh, my god.

35:51.862 --> 35:53.240
Oh, my god.
That's my story.

35:53.275 --> 35:57.126
It, it's based on a real case
when I was an intern.

35:57.161 --> 36:00.158
The teckolic acid in the tomato soup
activates the poison.

36:00.193 --> 36:02.921
It's virtually untraceable.

36:02.956 --> 36:05.877
They stole my story!
That's plagiarism!

36:05.912 --> 36:08.033
Yeah, well, actually,
it's murder.

36:08.068 --> 36:10.892
Did you keep a copy of the story?

36:15.328 --> 36:17.448
Whoa, mom. are you okay?

36:17.483 --> 36:20.236
Yeah, I'm great, and you're
not going to Jersey.

36:20.936 --> 36:22.691
Trevor, if you want to hang
out here, that's fine,

36:22.726 --> 36:25.248
but, uh, Benjy's staying with me.

36:25.283 --> 36:27.646
He's not leaving.

36:27.681 --> 36:30.042
I'll be right back.

36:39.213 --> 36:40.407
What's going on?

36:41.022 --> 36:42.885
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

36:42.920 --> 36:45.662
This is Varla davis.
She's my new...something.

36:45.697 --> 36:49.312
How y'all doing?
Are y'all pretend police officers, too?

36:49.347 --> 36:51.942
No, ma'am.
We are real policemen.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.927
- What's so important?
- I'm not crazy.

36:53.962 --> 36:56.149
It's true.

36:56.184 --> 36:59.525
A woman named Meredith preminger
lives right there.

36:59.983 --> 37:02.612
She's Sharona and Varla's
creative writing teacher,

37:02.647 --> 37:06.281
and last night she killed her husband.

37:06.316 --> 37:09.410
- And it was Sharona's idea.
- No, it wasn't.

37:11.738 --> 37:13.943
Well, in a way, I...

37:13.978 --> 37:15.067
Here's what happened.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.424
A month ago, Sharona wrote
a murder mystery

37:17.459 --> 37:21.560
about a woman who kills her husband
using a virtually untraceable poison.

37:21.595 --> 37:24.262
The story was a blueprint
for a perfect murder,

37:24.297 --> 37:27.263
exactly what Meredith and
her lover were looking for.

37:27.298 --> 37:28.769
But they had a problem.

37:28.804 --> 37:30.941
If they stole her idea,
after he died,

37:30.976 --> 37:32.866
Sharona might become suspicious.

37:32.901 --> 37:37.315
Somehow they had to discredit her
in advance before the murder.

37:37.350 --> 37:39.862
- So nobody would believe her.
- Exactly.

37:39.897 --> 37:41.855
So Sharona started seeing things.

37:41.890 --> 37:43.664
- Like dead people.
- And losing things.

37:43.699 --> 37:46.859
Yeah, they must have stolen the keys
from my purse and made copies of them,

37:46.894 --> 37:49.532
and that's how they got into my house
and moved everything around.

37:49.567 --> 37:51.660
Look, at 5:30, I am off the clock.

37:51.695 --> 37:53.497
I don't care if y'all are
still looking for Waldo.

37:53.532 --> 37:55.713
I'm outta here.

37:57.796 --> 38:00.015
- So that's the new nurse.
- Yeah.

38:00.050 --> 38:03.316
- How's that going?
- Oh, I love her.

38:03.351 --> 38:06.301
Couldn't be better.
Help me.

38:08.488 --> 38:11.589
- Ms. Preminger?
- That's right.

38:11.624 --> 38:14.257
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I know this is a bad time.

38:14.292 --> 38:18.300
I'm captain Stottlemeyer.
This is Adrian monk, lieutenant Disher,

38:18.335 --> 38:21.770
and I believe you know
Varla davis and Sharona fleming.

38:22.381 --> 38:23.817
What's going on?

38:23.852 --> 38:29.024
Well, ma'am, there have been some questions
raised about the death of your husband.

38:29.059 --> 38:30.874
By her?

38:32.450 --> 38:37.390
Captain, she's delusional.
You can ask anyone.

38:37.425 --> 38:39.741
Meredith, is there a problem?

38:39.776 --> 38:43.446
God, that's, that's him.

38:44.354 --> 38:47.191
They want to talk to me
about Max's death.

38:47.226 --> 38:50.717
It's not a good time.
Maybe after the services on Saturday.

38:50.752 --> 38:53.057
You mean after the body's
been cremated?

38:53.092 --> 38:56.502
You poisoned him, and you got
the idea from that story I wrote.

38:56.537 --> 38:58.909
- Did I?
- Yes.

38:58.944 --> 39:02.677
- Can you prove it?
- Yes, I can. It's right here.

39:02.712 --> 39:05.352
This is my second draft.

39:08.181 --> 39:10.446
The fatal recipe.

39:10.481 --> 39:14.970
That's a good title.

39:15.005 --> 39:19.793
Help me, help me, somebody help me.
Help me, please.

39:19.828 --> 39:23.095
- Help me now.
- Shoot.

39:23.130 --> 39:25.052
You know this is going
to affect our grade.

39:25.087 --> 39:27.048
Is there anything else?

39:29.715 --> 39:32.169
I didn't think so.

39:41.053 --> 39:43.230
They, they must have
taken the real papers

39:43.265 --> 39:46.310
when, when they were
in my house. They...

39:46.345 --> 39:48.485
My fault.
I should have read it first.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.109
Well, it couldn't have hurt.

39:50.144 --> 39:51.878
Sharona, has anybody else
read your story?

39:51.913 --> 39:53.976
No, she told me not
to show it to anyone.

39:54.011 --> 39:55.581
Would the poison show up
in an autopsy?

39:55.616 --> 39:58.513
Probably, but no judge is going
to order one without any evidence.

39:58.548 --> 40:01.338
Listen, there has to be
something. There, there...

40:01.373 --> 40:03.434
Oh, I know where there's a copy,

40:03.469 --> 40:06.670
a copy of your story in
your own handwriting.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.866
- That's impossible.
- Oh, it's possible,

40:08.901 --> 40:11.233
and I'll show it to you
on three conditions.

40:11.268 --> 40:13.694
Number one, I'm not
waiting two weeks.

40:13.729 --> 40:15.296
You taking him back today.

40:15.331 --> 40:18.273
Right now.
The party is over.

40:18.308 --> 40:20.182
What are the other two conditions?

40:20.217 --> 40:21.807
Forget the other conditions.

40:21.842 --> 40:25.201
I want you to stay with her,
Because y'all are a perfect team,

40:25.236 --> 40:28.487
- Sharona, Monk, and not me.
- Deal. Where's the story?

40:28.522 --> 40:32.826
Mrs. Preminger always told us
to write our first draft by hand,

40:32.861 --> 40:36.245
- something about feeling the words.
- Right, but I threw it out.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.082
She told us to throw away
our first drafts.

40:38.117 --> 40:43.493
Yeah, but you didn't. You used it
as scrap paper and packing material.

40:46.851 --> 40:48.690
Kenny smiled icily.

40:48.725 --> 40:50.148
Don't worry about the police, he said.

40:50.183 --> 40:53.009
The teckolic acid in the soup
is 100 % untraceable.

40:53.805 --> 40:57.425
- Just call me Mrs. Kojak.
- Well, where were you?

40:57.460 --> 41:01.357
I, she makes me very nervous.

41:01.392 --> 41:03.478
Well, I'm going to have another talk
with the grieving widow.

41:03.513 --> 41:05.297
Yes, you do that.

41:05.332 --> 41:07.953
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, dishwater.

41:07.988 --> 41:10.445
I need you to take
me home, baby. It's 5:30.

41:10.480 --> 41:13.772
- I have to go with the captain.
- No, you need to take me home.

41:13.807 --> 41:15.228
I'm not going to be standing around here

41:15.229 --> 41:16.898
watching y'all read
nobody their rights, now.

41:16.933 --> 41:20.623
I'm ready to go.
I said I say 5:30, I get off at 5:30.

41:20.658 --> 41:23.051
Get in the car.
Come on.

41:23.086 --> 41:24.919
Get in the car.
Let's go.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.390
What are you looking at?

41:30.425 --> 41:33.141
My eyes are up here!

41:46.236 --> 41:49.074
That's the D. A.
with a search warrant.

41:49.109 --> 41:52.107
There'll be an autopsy tomorrow.

41:52.142 --> 41:55.406
- Let's go home.
- Good idea.

42:00.366 --> 42:02.241
What?

42:02.276 --> 42:06.086
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

42:06.121 --> 42:08.548
- Get in the car.
- And, uh...

42:08.583 --> 42:11.876
can I be the one with
all the problems again?

42:11.911 --> 42:13.047
Sure.

42:13.082 --> 42:15.302
- Get in the car.
- What a relief.

42:15.337 --> 42:17.173
Unless, of course,
you miss it.

42:17.208 --> 42:18.989
We could take turns.

42:19.024 --> 42:21.424
I can go off the rails
Monday through Friday,

42:21.459 --> 42:22.983
you can have the weekends.

42:23.018 --> 42:24.360
Actually, you know what?
That would be perfect,

42:24.395 --> 42:27.071
because even though I would be
on my own for those two days,

42:27.106 --> 42:29.020
you couldn't stick me with Varla again,
because she always takes the weekends off.

42:29.055 --> 42:35.544
Of course, then you would have to prepare
my Saturday and Sunday meals in advance.
