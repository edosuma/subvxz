What are you waiting for?

04:12.461 --> 04:14.837
Punish me with death, Your Majesty

04:14.838 --> 04:16.755
Punish us with death

04:16.757 --> 04:18.716
Chief Royal Secretary to see His Majesty

04:24.056 --> 04:25.266
What happened?

04:26.475 --> 04:29.728
Silver spoon turned black

04:31.897 --> 04:34.525
I shall have my bedchamber
moved at once

04:35.192 --> 04:36.193
Your Majesty.

04:37.027 --> 04:41.030
You must hold your ground
especially at a time like this

04:41.031 --> 04:43.783
Is that all you have to say?

04:43.784 --> 04:48.788
What would please your enemies more
than to see you abandon your quarters?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.958
I beg Your Majesty to take heed

04:58.007 --> 04:59.466
Approach me

05:02.303 --> 05:03.470
Leave us

05:17.651 --> 05:19.153
Have you found one?

05:21.405 --> 05:23.282
Forgive me, Sire but

05:26.285 --> 05:27.578
Make haste

05:29.038 --> 05:30.748
He must look exactly like me

05:36.003 --> 05:37.838
I cannot trust anyone

05:43.093 --> 05:44.178
No one

05:47.639 --> 05:51.060
I beg Your Majesty to take heed

05:51.685 --> 05:55.230
We beg Your Majesty to take heed

05:55.814 --> 05:59.860
Don't you hear the cries of the scholars?

06:00.152 --> 06:03.322
I beg you to allow an inquisition
of Yu Jeong-ho

06:03.530 --> 06:05.823
We beg of Your Majesty

06:05.824 --> 06:10.161
No, Your Majesty!
If you allow inquisitions based on hearsay,

06:10.162 --> 06:12.622
there'll be a flood of
unjustified accusations

06:12.623 --> 06:15.208
giving rise to great disarray

06:15.209 --> 06:17.460
You are crossing the line
Chief Secretary!

06:17.461 --> 06:20.171
How dare you dismiss the advice
of the King's loyal servants?

06:20.172 --> 06:22.048
It worries me that
you're giving weight to rumor

06:22.049 --> 06:24.384
when there are more urgent
outstanding state affairs

06:24.385 --> 06:27.763
What is more urgent than treason?

06:28.013 --> 06:29.138
Your Majesty.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.724
<i>Yu Jeong-ho
must be put to death at once</i>

06:31.725 --> 06:33.434
No, Your Majesty!

06:33.435 --> 06:36.604
Punishment can wait until
right and wrong has been determined

06:36.605 --> 06:38.648
Yu Jeong-ho is a dangerous man

06:38.649 --> 06:40.733
Give us a royal command,
Your Majesty

06:40.734 --> 06:43.737
Your command, Your Majesty

06:47.491 --> 06:51.161
His Majesty the King!

07:18.647 --> 07:19.440
Your Majesty

07:19.565 --> 07:21.149
Your Majesty

07:21.150 --> 07:25.445
Yu is a heretic
who rejects orthodox teachings

07:25.446 --> 07:28.364
Retribution for his crime
must not be delayed

07:28.365 --> 07:31.743
We beg Your Majesty to take heed

07:31.785 --> 07:34.412
I beg Your Majesty to take heed

07:34.413 --> 07:39.041
Tread on our backs if you must

07:39.042 --> 07:42.629
We beg of Your Majesty

07:46.967 --> 07:48.926
This time.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.306
They will really have
my brother beheaded

07:52.431 --> 07:54.308
Madam

07:58.312 --> 08:00.272
This madness will only end

08:01.482 --> 08:03.275
upon my death

08:04.234 --> 08:07.321
His Majesty the King!

08:07.404 --> 08:11.115
The King climbs over the wall
and opens the door

08:11.116 --> 08:13.327
<i>asking for Hung-fin</i>

08:14.536 --> 08:16.746
Hong-jin

08:16.747 --> 08:19.833
Where are you, my dear?

08:19.958 --> 08:21.167
Gotcha!

08:21.168 --> 08:23.545
You're hiding here

08:23.837 --> 08:25.923
Come on out

08:26.131 --> 08:29.384
Come on out of there

08:33.804 --> 08:35.057
Oh my!

08:35.807 --> 08:36.850
Let's see

08:39.061 --> 08:42.020
Aren't you voluptuous?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.900
You're a lucky man

08:58.664 --> 08:59.997
Your Majesty.

08:59.998 --> 09:04.169
You call upon me without notice again

09:05.712 --> 09:08.882
If you keep doing this,
I fear it will be the death of me

09:09.216 --> 09:11.885
Come here, whore

09:14.012 --> 09:17.807
The King takes her soft hand

09:17.808 --> 09:20.894
and pulls her deep into the Court

09:21.562 --> 09:25.023
He reaches for her undergarment

09:26.024 --> 09:29.820
and her ample derriere rubs
against his royal body

09:30.237 --> 09:33.156
The King smiles happily

09:34.074 --> 09:35.950
Then, once on the left

09:35.951 --> 09:37.785
and once on the right

09:37.786 --> 09:40.205
and flips her over for some more

09:41.415 --> 09:43.291
Watching the sunrise in the east,

09:43.292 --> 09:45.418
screw, screw!

09:45.419 --> 09:47.128
Watching the sunset in the west,

09:47.129 --> 09:49.338
screw, screw!

09:49.339 --> 09:53.092
Screw here and screw there

09:53.093 --> 09:57.764
all night long

10:13.822 --> 10:14.948
Take off the cover

10:20.287 --> 10:21.370
Sir, sir

10:21.371 --> 10:22.830
Listen to me, I beg of you

10:22.831 --> 10:25.082
The King involving himself
with the court ladies

10:25.083 --> 10:28.253
is such an absurd idea

10:28.420 --> 10:30.129
Something that can
never happen in real life

10:30.130 --> 10:32.632
and what makes it interesting

10:32.633 --> 10:33.842
Help him up

10:47.564 --> 10:48.564
With all due respect, sir

10:49.399 --> 10:50.484
who are you?

10:56.531 --> 10:59.284
Listen to me carefully
if you wish to live

11:01.536 --> 11:04.748
In a moment, you shall have
an audience with the King

11:06.208 --> 11:07.417
Sir?

11:07.459 --> 11:11.170
When His Majesty asks you a question,
respond with "Yes, Your Majesty"

11:11.171 --> 11:13.297
When a longer answer is required,

11:13.298 --> 11:15.676
you must answer by saying
"If it pleases Your Majesty"

11:16.968 --> 11:22.349
You must not ask questions
or look upon his face

11:25.435 --> 11:27.145
Make him presentable to the King

12:11.314 --> 12:12.566
Lift your head

13:13.752 --> 13:14.961
Repeat what I say

13:15.921 --> 13:17.422
Is anyone there?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.883
Yes, Your Majesty

13:20.759 --> 13:22.469
I said repeat

13:24.638 --> 13:25.721
Yes, Your Majesty

13:25.722 --> 13:27.015
Insufferable wretch!

13:27.307 --> 13:29.684
Is that all you have to say?

13:40.111 --> 13:42.030
If it pleases Your Majesty

14:00.632 --> 14:04.469
Repeat what I say,
"Is anyone there?"

14:07.138 --> 14:08.682
I said repeat

14:13.311 --> 14:14.229
Insufferable wretch!

14:15.814 --> 14:17.941
Is that all you have to say?

14:29.911 --> 14:31.288
Not bad indeed

14:32.330 --> 14:35.332
He performs masked farce
at courtesans' house

14:35.333 --> 14:37.167
Judging from his basic knowledge
of Chinese characters,

14:37.168 --> 14:39.504
I presume he is not of the low birth

15:49.115 --> 15:50.367
Repeat what I say

15:51.701 --> 15:53.286
Is anyone there?

15:56.498 --> 15:58.291
Yes, Your Majesty

15:59.626 --> 16:01.586
Would you care for a night snack?

16:03.755 --> 16:05.131
All right

16:05.340 --> 16:06.967
Yes, Your Majesty

16:15.892 --> 16:18.311
Have a night snack brought in

16:20.230 --> 16:22.524
Have plenty brought in

16:35.120 --> 16:36.496
You scared me!

16:57.684 --> 17:02.022
Calling upon me so frequently
will upset the Queen

17:03.023 --> 17:05.025
Will it not?

17:06.734 --> 17:07.819
What choice do I have?

17:09.154 --> 17:12.198
I only sleep soundly next to you

18:05.085 --> 18:06.252
Get up

18:12.759 --> 18:13.968
Sir

18:15.053 --> 18:16.387
You can go now

18:34.447 --> 18:36.573
Once every 3 nights,
when the curfew bell sounds

18:36.574 --> 18:38.368
wait by the west palace gate

18:38.618 --> 18:40.495
Don't be late

18:44.082 --> 18:48.044
You shall not speak of
anything about tonight

18:49.337 --> 18:50.964
You found the right man

19:01.224 --> 19:03.143
Follow me looking at my heels only

19:16.823 --> 19:18.366
Be careful

19:24.247 --> 19:26.374
Three!

19:26.666 --> 19:28.917
Spare me, My Lord!

19:28.918 --> 19:33.338
He was charged
with telling of lewd stories

19:33.339 --> 19:37.467
I beg of you!
I never knew it constituted a crime

19:37.468 --> 19:38.552
I'm telling the truth

19:38.553 --> 19:42.222
The gentry talk of far more lewd things,
do they not?

19:42.223 --> 19:44.057
Who are you comparing yourself to?

19:44.058 --> 19:45.018
Four

19:45.185 --> 19:46.811
Four!

19:48.313 --> 19:50.148
Whoever it was that ratted me out,

19:50.315 --> 19:51.691
- I shall kill the wretched bastard
- Five

19:51.733 --> 19:53.568
Five!

19:54.194 --> 19:55.612
Hold it

20:00.491 --> 20:01.533
Does it hurt?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.619
Spare me, my Lord

20:03.620 --> 20:04.745
I hear about

20:04.746 --> 20:07.790
a new young courtesan
who just arrived at Honglu

20:08.041 --> 20:09.334
How about it?

20:09.417 --> 20:10.919
Her, in exchange for this

20:11.127 --> 20:15.632
But it's not up to me to decide

20:16.591 --> 20:17.842
- My Lord!
- Hit the shit out of him

20:17.884 --> 20:21.012
Save me, my Lord!

20:38.947 --> 20:40.949
Take all the time you need, Miss

20:43.117 --> 20:45.161
Did you say you were from Jeonju?

20:45.453 --> 20:46.287
Yes

20:47.664 --> 20:49.499
How old are you?

20:50.667 --> 20:53.253
Fifteen

21:03.763 --> 21:05.265
I am terribly sorry

21:06.808 --> 21:10.103
I miss my mama

21:19.362 --> 21:22.115
Not a single chick was killed

21:22.323 --> 21:25.617
If arsenic was present,
even in the smallest dose

21:25.618 --> 21:27.620
it would have killed the chicks

21:29.455 --> 21:32.833
If it wasn't poison,
what turned the spoon black?

21:32.834 --> 21:38.840
Recently, they started using
bamboo salt to season King's food

21:44.554 --> 21:46.514
Bamboo salt?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.516
Yes, Your Majesty

21:48.641 --> 21:52.895
The iron found in bamboo salt changed
the color of the spoon

21:55.982 --> 22:00.653
I implore you, Sire and
I offer my head to say this

22:01.487 --> 22:03.655
If this is about Yu Jeong-ho,
I shall not hear more of it

22:03.656 --> 22:05.658
Forgive me, Your Majesty

22:05.867 --> 22:08.493
but Yu Jeong-ho would never
plot treason against you

22:08.494 --> 22:09.203
Enough!

22:11.831 --> 22:13.207
I know it, too

22:16.544 --> 22:22.508
Yu is my loyal servant
and trusted brother-in-law

22:24.135 --> 22:26.971
But I'll need to sacrifice
someone like Yu

22:28.014 --> 22:30.183
in order to gain their trust

22:38.649 --> 22:39.650
Sir.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.986
The royal physician sent for you

23:01.714 --> 23:03.132
Come this way

23:20.483 --> 23:22.068
It appears that he's been poisoned

23:23.403 --> 23:25.405
Will he recover?

23:28.408 --> 23:29.659
Forgive me but

23:30.743 --> 23:35.873
I cannot confirm anything
at this point

23:36.040 --> 23:39.794
We may need to prepare
for a national calamity

23:41.921 --> 23:43.631
Who else knows about this?

23:45.425 --> 23:49.512
So far, only myself and Chief Eunuch

23:56.936 --> 24:00.982
I shall take full responsibility
for what I'm about to say

24:01.858 --> 24:03.443
Both you and Chief Eunuch

24:03.734 --> 24:07.863
shall remain silent
about His Majesty's condition

24:07.864 --> 24:09.072
But, sir!

24:09.073 --> 24:10.700
You know better than anyone

24:12.118 --> 24:15.413
that you will not live
if the King passes away

24:18.416 --> 24:20.543
If the word about
the King's condition gets out

24:21.544 --> 24:24.172
the Court will fall
into unimaginable chaos

24:25.923 --> 24:29.302
That is clearly
what the conspirator wanted

24:31.429 --> 24:36.267
The King is confined to bed
because of cold

24:38.311 --> 24:39.769
Please wake Captain Do

24:39.770 --> 24:41.856
and fetch the jester at once

24:43.483 --> 24:46.110
Take His Majesty to a remote temple

24:47.320 --> 24:50.072
Absolutely no one is
to know about this

24:50.656 --> 24:52.825
until the poison is identified

24:53.075 --> 24:55.161
and His Majesty recovers

24:57.830 --> 25:00.082
It's not the night we arranged

25:00.333 --> 25:03.336
The King must be going
somewhere nice

25:04.337 --> 25:07.131
I see the beating
didn't teach you anything

25:10.551 --> 25:11.969
I beg your pardon?

25:12.720 --> 25:15.348
Was it you that ratted me out?

25:15.806 --> 25:17.975
I don't know how to thank you!

25:19.018 --> 25:22.688
It was indeed an insufferable crime
to make fun of the King

25:23.105 --> 25:27.025
and the magistrate who took
the girl's virginity for my crimes

25:27.026 --> 25:28.528
is innocent

25:28.861 --> 25:31.239
But what did that
15-year-old girl do wrong?

25:33.491 --> 25:38.371
Was there any untruth in what I said?

25:40.414 --> 25:42.166
Don't let your tongue run wild

25:47.046 --> 25:48.089
It's Captain Do

25:53.219 --> 26:00.351
His Majesty wishes to stay
in his quarters tonight

26:01.686 --> 26:08.359
I shall escort him out
as soon as the King is finished

26:19.412 --> 26:21.038
Hitting me and shit

26:28.546 --> 26:30.214
Where is His Majesty?

26:31.507 --> 26:32.591
The King is unwell

26:32.592 --> 26:33.593
Oh

26:33.759 --> 26:34.927
How sick is he?

26:49.191 --> 26:51.319
Is it serious?

26:51.611 --> 26:53.946
You'll have to act
as his stand-in for a while

26:55.531 --> 26:57.116
For how long?

26:58.451 --> 27:00.286
There is nothing for you to worry

27:00.494 --> 27:02.955
as long as you do as I say

27:12.340 --> 27:13.716
I won't do it

27:13.924 --> 27:15.051
Wretch!

27:15.301 --> 27:16.760
It's for the good of the kingdom

27:16.761 --> 27:18.304
And none of my concern

27:18.429 --> 27:20.139
You're asking me
to put my neck on the line

27:21.474 --> 27:23.309
I can't do it

27:25.811 --> 27:27.271
It's 20 silver coins now

27:27.813 --> 27:29.649
I shall give you 20 more after

27:34.987 --> 27:39.950
My life for a few coins

27:41.827 --> 27:42.995
I'm not that crazy

28:00.179 --> 28:08.179
Did you say
'for the good of the kingdom'?

28:10.189 --> 28:17.738
The good of the kingdom means
the good of the people

28:18.197 --> 28:20.866
Man, what's happening

28:24.745 --> 28:31.544
I trust you'll keep your word
about the balance

28:50.604 --> 28:52.814
His Majesty has a terrible cold

28:52.815 --> 28:55.317
and shall not be attending
this morning's conference

28:55.401 --> 28:59.321
The morning conference will
be held again in three days

29:02.408 --> 29:06.662
The first thing to learn
are those nearest to the King

29:06.912 --> 29:09.415
You have already met
Chief Eunuch and Captain Do

29:09.749 --> 29:14.545
Lady Han is King's designated court lady
who serves him closest

29:18.799 --> 29:20.092
Your Majesty.

29:20.301 --> 29:23.596
The Queen asks for an audience

29:23.888 --> 29:26.932
The Court has
eyes and ears everywhere

29:27.099 --> 29:29.018
You shall take extra care at all times

29:29.143 --> 29:30.895
What do you mean?

29:31.353 --> 29:32.980
Is he so terribly ill?

29:33.063 --> 29:34.355
Your Highness

29:34.356 --> 29:36.358
Tell him I need to see him urgently

29:36.650 --> 29:37.442
Your Royal Highness

29:37.443 --> 29:40.696
Is he with a court lady?

29:41.405 --> 29:44.407
You won't get near the Queen
or the concubines

29:44.408 --> 29:48.037
and be extra cautious not to
chance upon the Queen

29:48.329 --> 29:50.330
You may resemble the King

29:50.331 --> 29:53.626
but you won't fool those
who share the bed with him

29:53.959 --> 29:57.463
I told the officials you can't speak
due to a troubled throat

29:57.713 --> 29:59.798
If there is anything you need to ask,

29:59.799 --> 30:02.259
ask Chief Eunuch

30:03.052 --> 30:05.304
Can I ask something?

30:05.638 --> 30:07.431
Come closer

30:10.100 --> 30:11.644
<i>You know I...</i>

30:16.315 --> 30:20.820
I'm sorry but I need to take a dump

30:21.278 --> 30:23.155
I couldn't find a toilet for two days

30:24.490 --> 30:28.202
Ask for a plum blossom pot

30:28.327 --> 30:29.662
I need that right away

30:42.675 --> 30:44.176
You

30:46.428 --> 30:47.972
What are you waiting for?

30:49.807 --> 30:51.016
Leave me

30:51.267 --> 30:54.353
I need to take a crap
Get the hell out

30:54.645 --> 30:55.645
Hurry!

30:55.646 --> 30:56.438
Your Majesty

31:06.073 --> 31:07.658
Congratulations, Your Majesty

31:12.788 --> 31:15.374
Congratulations, Your Majesty

31:19.086 --> 31:20.588
Hey! Hey!

31:22.631 --> 31:24.174
What are you doing?

31:25.634 --> 31:26.342
Back off

31:26.343 --> 31:27.510
Punish me with death, Your Majesty

31:27.511 --> 31:29.680
Why would I kill you?

31:29.889 --> 31:31.849
Just leave me

31:35.561 --> 31:36.144
Leave me

31:36.145 --> 31:37.396
Your Majesty

31:41.442 --> 31:42.610
Don't come any closer

31:45.362 --> 31:47.907
When you wake in the morning,
clear your throat

31:48.908 --> 31:51.410
Court ladies will bring in water
for washing up

32:28.197 --> 32:30.866
You could've told me that earlier

32:33.619 --> 32:35.787
Congratulations, Your Majesty

32:35.788 --> 32:38.499
Congratulate what?

32:39.249 --> 32:43.003
There is no outhouse for the King
Ask for a plum blossom pot

32:43.253 --> 32:44.755
I already know that

32:45.839 --> 32:48.257
Where are they taking it to?

32:48.258 --> 32:50.594
It's sent to the royal physician

32:50.844 --> 32:54.223
to check the color and hardness

32:54.640 --> 32:56.225
and taste

32:59.311 --> 33:01.021
They taste it?

33:05.693 --> 33:07.653
Next are the royal concubines

33:12.950 --> 33:14.535
So many of them!

33:17.705 --> 33:18.872
Eunuch Kim!

33:19.123 --> 33:20.749
It's Eunuch Jo, Sire

33:22.334 --> 33:23.627
Eunuch Jo

33:23.877 --> 33:29.633
I heard that the King shares his bed
with his concubines every night

33:29.842 --> 33:32.302
for a royal coitus

33:32.428 --> 33:36.014
It's a matter concerning
the inner affairs of the Court

33:36.015 --> 33:44.015
I was just worried that one of
the concubines might pay a visit

33:44.148 --> 33:46.232
I can only refuse so many times

33:46.233 --> 33:49.528
Not to mention
they might get suspicious

33:53.032 --> 33:54.575
<i>So...</i> can I?

33:56.118 --> 33:57.870
I beg your pardon?

33:59.538 --> 34:02.374
Just an amusing thought

34:04.793 --> 34:09.380
The King's taster tastes the food
to check for any poisons

34:09.797 --> 34:13.051
Meals are served twice a day
in the morning and evening

34:13.052 --> 34:14.052
For light meals and snacks,

34:14.053 --> 34:16.722
- he favors buckwheat and dumplings
- Bring it in

34:27.649 --> 34:28.775
Take it out

34:32.946 --> 34:34.614
That was good

34:38.911 --> 34:41.746
I thought I had a big appetite

34:42.581 --> 34:45.083
but the King must be quite
a big eater himself

34:46.126 --> 34:48.420
The court ladies at the royal kitchen

34:48.587 --> 34:52.049
eat the leftovers from King's table

34:55.803 --> 34:56.844
Are you telling me

34:58.305 --> 35:00.098
that they starved all day
because of me?

35:00.099 --> 35:05.937
They are only allowed to cook for the King
and for him alone

35:05.938 --> 35:10.608
That is quite astonishing

35:10.609 --> 35:13.403
No wonder they were
looking at me horrified

35:45.269 --> 35:46.854
That lady over there

35:48.313 --> 35:49.356
Who is she?

35:51.024 --> 35:53.694
It's Her Royal Highness
the Queen Consort

35:54.027 --> 35:55.654
That makes her...

35:56.405 --> 35:57.489
Oh!

35:57.865 --> 36:03.662
The Chief Secretary insisted upon
avoiding her at all costs

36:39.406 --> 36:41.616
The morning conference was
postponed for three days

36:41.617 --> 36:43.778
But the individual audiences
cannot be delayed any more

36:44.745 --> 36:47.145
You'll only need three phrases
during the individual meetings

36:47.456 --> 36:49.374
Do as you see fit

36:49.625 --> 36:50.666
Next

36:50.667 --> 36:51.919
Bring him in

36:53.420 --> 36:54.546
Go on

36:57.341 --> 36:59.176
Do as you see fit

37:01.345 --> 37:03.971
I'm sorry

37:03.972 --> 37:04.848
Wretch!

37:05.390 --> 37:07.184
Have you not heard
His Majesty's voice?

37:07.392 --> 37:08.810
Keep it low and solemn

37:17.778 --> 37:19.529
As you see fit

37:23.408 --> 37:25.034
Do as you see fit

37:25.035 --> 37:26.869
Your grace is immeasurable

37:26.870 --> 37:29.248
Bring in the next

37:30.415 --> 37:33.502
Morning conference is vitally important

37:34.127 --> 37:37.088
It is where high-ranking officials gather

37:37.089 --> 37:39.257
to hear the King's decrees

37:39.258 --> 37:41.260
Mistakes will not go unnoticed

37:42.219 --> 37:42.552
Yes, sir

37:42.553 --> 37:44.804
First row on the left,
two down from the left

37:44.805 --> 37:46.473
is Ha, the Tax Minister

37:47.307 --> 37:50.435
For the sake of power, he will
happily walk into a manure tub

37:51.478 --> 37:55.607
Next to him is Kim Jong-se,
the Justice Minister

37:55.857 --> 37:58.359
He is a greedy and cruel character

37:58.360 --> 38:01.154
who will chase his enemies
to the end of days

38:02.030 --> 38:05.324
The man that always agrees
to the Justice Minister is

38:05.325 --> 38:07.285
Inspector General, Lee Yun-sang

38:07.286 --> 38:11.331
All that he cares about
is maintaining his position

38:11.915 --> 38:14.126
At the rightmost of the first row is

38:15.252 --> 38:17.128
Park Chung-seo, the Minister of Interior

38:17.129 --> 38:19.089
You must remember him

38:19.464 --> 38:23.635
Don't you see what
the King is trying to do?

38:24.803 --> 38:27.306
The King is giving us Yu Jeong-ho

38:27.723 --> 38:30.057
to diverting our attention from issues

38:30.058 --> 38:33.811
such as troop dispatch or
the uniform land tax law

38:33.812 --> 38:35.646
Is it not the truth?

38:35.647 --> 38:41.528
His eyes are as sharp as a hawk's
and his character as venomous as a viper's

38:43.322 --> 38:45.073
From this moment on,

38:45.449 --> 38:49.161
you shall address me and the Chief Eunuch
the way you would a servant

38:49.661 --> 38:50.286
Sir?

38:50.287 --> 38:51.663
Remember

38:51.913 --> 38:56.168
the Court has eyes and ears everywhere

39:02.090 --> 39:03.341
What you have in front of you

39:03.342 --> 39:06.053
is the royal decree to be passed down
at the conference tomorrow

39:06.511 --> 39:09.389
Read it out loud, Your Majesty

39:18.398 --> 39:20.441
I command my trusted council

39:20.442 --> 39:23.736
Tax Minister shall draw a bill to

39:23.737 --> 39:25.322
Stop!

39:27.074 --> 39:29.034
His Majesty is a king,

39:29.242 --> 39:31.495
not a storyteller from market place

39:31.912 --> 39:33.537
Low and solemnly

39:33.538 --> 39:34.706
Like a king

39:45.008 --> 39:46.968
I command my trusted council

39:47.886 --> 39:49.262
Tax Minister

39:49.513 --> 39:53.725
Draw up a bill to restore
the uniform land tax law

39:55.102 --> 39:56.227
Minister of Construction

39:56.228 --> 39:58.563
Stop the palace renovation immediately

39:58.939 --> 40:02.359
How can you
justify renovating the palace

40:02.567 --> 40:05.445
at the cost of my good people?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.321
Minister of Justice

40:07.322 --> 40:10.409
I shall not question the wrongdoings
of Magistrate Yu Jeong-ho

40:10.575 --> 40:12.910
All treason must be dealt
with the strictest law

40:12.911 --> 40:17.582
But the law must not be
used to punish the innocent

40:18.041 --> 40:19.709
I command my trusted council

40:19.918 --> 40:24.339
Those that disturb the peace of the Court
by stirring up groundless accusations

40:24.798 --> 40:27.968
shall be dealt as strictly
as those guilty of treason

40:29.094 --> 40:32.055
This concludes
the morning conference

40:35.100 --> 40:37.018
Yes, Your Majesty

41:01.501 --> 41:04.421
The morning conference is prepared

41:32.699 --> 41:36.912
His Majesty the King!

41:50.884 --> 41:55.096
His Majesty the King!

42:38.348 --> 42:40.809
The morning conference
shall commence

42:43.645 --> 42:47.607
His Majesty shall pass down
the royal decree

42:54.239 --> 42:55.949
Your Majesty.

42:56.116 --> 42:59.578
I heard you suffered
from a terrible fever

42:59.953 --> 43:02.247
How does Your Majesty
feel this morning?

43:04.249 --> 43:05.834
Quite well

43:06.042 --> 43:07.711
Your grace is immeasurable,
Your Majesty

43:07.877 --> 43:10.005
Your grace is immeasurable

43:40.785 --> 43:42.621
This is a blank scroll

43:58.136 --> 44:01.222
Due to the pain in the throat

44:04.059 --> 44:06.102
His Majesty shall not
read out the royal decree

44:06.645 --> 44:08.938
I'll do the honor
on His Majesty's behalf

44:11.650 --> 44:12.776
Tax Minister

44:12.984 --> 44:14.277
Yes, Your Majesty

44:14.486 --> 44:19.574
You shall draw up a bill to restore
the uniform land tax law

44:19.866 --> 44:20.825
Justice Minister

44:22.494 --> 44:23.744
Yes, Your Majesty

44:23.745 --> 44:28.708
Prepare a report on which regions
the law should be enforced first

44:29.084 --> 44:30.210
Yes, Your Majesty

44:30.627 --> 44:32.337
Trusted servants, hear my words

44:32.379 --> 44:35.840
I shall no longer question
the wrongdoings of Yu Jeong-ho

44:36.132 --> 44:40.636
Any man found guilty of disturbing the peace
with groundless accusations

44:40.637 --> 44:42.389
shall be punished severely

44:42.597 --> 44:46.851
I trust you shall endeavor
to fulfill the royal decree

44:47.519 --> 44:51.856
This concludes the morning conference

44:52.023 --> 44:55.985
Your grace is immeasurable,
Your Majesty

45:00.865 --> 45:02.867
Revive the identification system?

45:03.118 --> 45:05.245
And restore the uniform land tax law?

45:05.620 --> 45:07.871
The passing of the bill wasn't
delayed for our interest

45:07.872 --> 45:11.709
The Chief Secretary is to blame
for this mess

45:11.710 --> 45:13.711
Didn't I make that clear earlier?

45:13.712 --> 45:16.714
He disturbs peace
with his three-inch tongue

45:16.715 --> 45:18.841
The King has ordered for reports

45:18.842 --> 45:21.720
What should I do now?

45:42.240 --> 45:44.409
Who made this red bean porridge?

45:44.951 --> 45:48.036
Your Majesty didn't appear
to have fully recovered

45:48.037 --> 45:50.373
I asked you who made it

45:52.917 --> 45:58.131
The taster asked the palace matron
at the royal kitchen

46:06.598 --> 46:08.892
It tastes really good

46:09.100 --> 46:11.478
Just like what I used to eat as a child

46:11.936 --> 46:13.813
What is your name?

46:14.022 --> 46:16.024
Lady Han, Sire

46:20.737 --> 46:22.405
And yours?

46:23.364 --> 46:27.243
Your Majesty, it's Sa-wol

46:27.952 --> 46:28.995
How old are you?

46:30.121 --> 46:31.914
Fifteen, Sire

46:31.915 --> 46:34.000
Fifteen

46:40.298 --> 46:42.884
I'm done for now
Clear the table

46:46.846 --> 46:50.308
You heard His Majesty
Make haste

46:50.517 --> 46:51.976
Yes, sir

47:03.029 --> 47:05.948
I missed you, good old rice!

47:05.949 --> 47:07.199
Stock up while you can

47:07.200 --> 47:09.410
You don't know when
he'll get his appetite back

47:12.997 --> 47:14.249
My Lady

47:14.290 --> 47:16.960
Do you think the King
has changed recently?

47:17.001 --> 47:18.085
What do you mean by that?

47:18.086 --> 47:20.045
His complexion as well as his palate

47:20.046 --> 47:23.340
He chuckles a lot, too

47:23.341 --> 47:24.759
And Yeong-yi told me

47:25.301 --> 47:27.462
that even the sound of his royal
defecation has changed

48:08.595 --> 48:11.639
Fortunately, his pulse is returning

48:13.558 --> 48:15.018
But, sir

48:15.560 --> 48:19.314
it appears that he's been drugged
not poisoned

48:19.814 --> 48:21.649
What do you mean by that?

48:21.858 --> 48:26.029
Where has he been
going on his outings?

48:34.787 --> 48:37.916
He's been avoiding royal coitus?

48:38.124 --> 48:42.211
How on earth could I know?

48:43.087 --> 48:47.674
I hear he is staying clear of
the concubines and the Queen, too

48:47.675 --> 48:50.053
The rumor has spread
all over the Court

48:50.428 --> 48:53.305
He is avoiding the
sweet smell of women

48:53.306 --> 48:57.142
that he favors so much

48:57.143 --> 48:58.269
My Lord

49:05.902 --> 49:06.945
My Lord

49:07.487 --> 49:10.615
The Chief Secretary is
up to something

49:10.907 --> 49:14.869
He's been inquiring about Lady Ahn

49:14.994 --> 49:16.454
What should we do?

49:18.456 --> 49:24.379
Take some men and burn down
the poppy patch at once

49:25.254 --> 49:29.467
We must get rid of all evidence

49:51.239 --> 49:54.993
Lady Ahn has been in the wind
for a few days now

50:37.744 --> 50:39.454
As you see fit

50:39.954 --> 50:42.165
Your grace is immeasurable

50:50.048 --> 50:52.717
Did you dissent
the uniform land tax bill?

50:52.884 --> 50:55.303
But that's what you told me to do

50:55.428 --> 50:57.721
To respond to whatever
the officials say with

50:57.722 --> 50:59.098
Do as you see fit

51:07.106 --> 51:08.940
Did you approve the interrogation
of Yu Jeong-ho?

51:08.941 --> 51:12.070
No, I didn't do that

51:12.236 --> 51:16.907
I only approved the setting up
of an inquisitorial committee

51:16.908 --> 51:18.659
That's the same thing!

51:18.951 --> 51:21.996
Didn't I warn you to be extra
cautious around Park Chung-seo?

51:25.124 --> 51:27.001
I'll call for a high officials' meeting

51:27.251 --> 51:29.252
You will announce the reintroduction
of the uniform land tax bill

51:29.253 --> 51:33.132
Why keep making me
change my words?

51:33.257 --> 51:35.259
Just do as I say

51:35.510 --> 51:37.720
You must give to take

51:38.096 --> 51:39.554
That's politics

51:39.555 --> 51:43.184
Shouldn't I know
what I'm giving away and taking

51:44.519 --> 51:46.395
at least?

51:53.319 --> 51:54.821
Do you know, Chief

51:54.987 --> 51:56.655
what the big deal is about

51:56.656 --> 51:58.696
the identification law and
the uniform land tax law?

51:58.908 --> 52:00.284
I do not, Sire

52:04.122 --> 52:06.040
What do I need to know anyway?

52:06.833 --> 52:09.168
I only need to do as I'm told

52:09.418 --> 52:15.591
But I can get you books on the subject

52:17.802 --> 52:19.845
If everyone carries
an identification tag,

52:19.846 --> 52:23.974
it would be easy to check the identity
and convenient for taxation purposes

52:23.975 --> 52:26.727
Not for everyone, Sire

52:27.145 --> 52:33.109
An identification tag carries with it
the duty of compulsory labor

52:33.442 --> 52:35.945
There are people who abandon
their tags and cross the border

52:36.195 --> 52:39.574
or voluntarily get castrated
to become a eunuch

52:39.866 --> 52:42.493
You mean they
cut off their own balls?

52:44.954 --> 52:50.877
That means such eunuchs could be
in this Court

52:51.002 --> 52:52.170
Do you know anyone?

53:01.262 --> 53:02.722
Chief

53:03.556 --> 53:07.143
It might be an awkward question

53:08.060 --> 53:10.438
Ask me anything, Sire

53:10.855 --> 53:13.107
Do you really not have it?

53:15.359 --> 53:17.527
I do not, Sire

53:17.528 --> 53:20.823
Then, when you go to the outhouse

53:20.990 --> 53:23.659
do you do it standing up

53:23.910 --> 53:25.203
or sitting down?

53:26.537 --> 53:27.538
Well

53:38.174 --> 53:39.967
It must have hurt

53:46.849 --> 53:48.017
Chief Secretary!

53:48.684 --> 53:49.644
Your Majesty!

53:53.773 --> 53:54.899
Chief Secretary

53:56.609 --> 53:57.735
Chief Secretary

54:03.157 --> 54:04.075
Chief Secretary

54:05.618 --> 54:06.535
Chief Secretary

54:07.078 --> 54:07.995
Your Majesty

54:08.871 --> 54:11.498
The king never comes to his servant

54:11.499 --> 54:13.667
But you're a busy man

54:13.668 --> 54:14.960
Let me ask you a question

54:14.961 --> 54:17.421
I stayed up all night studying

54:17.713 --> 54:20.257
and I think the uniform land tax law
is a really good law

54:20.258 --> 54:21.675
So why was it abolished

54:21.676 --> 54:24.262
only after a year?

54:24.470 --> 54:25.262
Sire

54:25.263 --> 54:26.973
Secretary

54:27.807 --> 54:30.267
It's not a question of
right and wrong

54:30.268 --> 54:31.936
Politics is just politics

54:32.228 --> 54:34.828
There are a lot of suspicious eyes
Return to your quarters at once

54:39.652 --> 54:42.238
Have a man watch the Secretary

54:42.530 --> 54:46.575
I want to know his every movement

54:46.784 --> 54:47.785
Yes, sir

54:49.328 --> 54:51.372
I just don't understand

54:52.081 --> 54:53.707
Why does everyone get so sensitive

54:53.708 --> 54:55.626
whenever the uniform
land tax law is mentioned?

54:56.294 --> 55:00.298
Probably because of resistance
by landowners

55:00.506 --> 55:03.551
It's only fair to impose tax
according to how much land you own

55:03.884 --> 55:06.637
Those who have more
should contribute more

55:07.054 --> 55:11.517
Sire, Your way of speaking
resembles the King more and more

55:12.143 --> 55:13.477
Is that so?

55:15.021 --> 55:18.816
I sometimes feel like the real King

55:20.318 --> 55:24.113
Your Majesty, a night snack is ready

55:25.906 --> 55:27.158
Bring it in

55:34.373 --> 55:35.541
Sa-wol

55:37.752 --> 55:39.169
Yes, Your Majesty

55:39.170 --> 55:40.880
Did you say you were fifteen?

55:41.005 --> 55:43.132
I am, Sire

55:44.967 --> 55:47.178
How did you end up living in the Court?

55:49.680 --> 55:50.514
Here

55:51.098 --> 55:55.186
I'm only asking out of curiosity
You may answer freely

55:59.732 --> 56:04.695
My father was a tenant farmer
in the mountainous region

56:05.196 --> 56:10.408
Then one day, he was told
to pay tax in abalone

56:10.409 --> 56:12.161
Abalone from a farmer?

56:14.038 --> 56:14.954
What happened?

56:14.955 --> 56:18.459
He had to borrow at high interest

56:20.211 --> 56:23.756
Debt begot more debt

56:24.131 --> 56:28.219
We ended up losing the house
and the little land we owned

56:28.636 --> 56:32.181
My father was jailed

56:32.556 --> 56:33.974
Oh dear

56:34.225 --> 56:36.727
When that still wasn't enough
to pay off the debt

56:37.228 --> 56:43.067
My mother and brother
were sold as slaves

56:45.403 --> 56:48.072
and I,
to a deputy minister's household

56:48.364 --> 56:49.907
Insufferable!

56:51.826 --> 56:54.203
My father was left by himself

56:57.706 --> 57:00.084
He never recovered from
the injuries of the torture

57:02.044 --> 57:04.087
and passed away in the same year

57:04.088 --> 57:05.296
Fucking bastards!

57:05.297 --> 57:06.465
Sire!

57:12.012 --> 57:13.848
Don't you miss your mother?

57:15.599 --> 57:17.309
If only I knew
whether she lives or not

57:18.686 --> 57:20.604
I have no other wish in the world

57:25.734 --> 57:33.734
I'll reunite you with your mother
before this act is over

57:36.078 --> 57:37.830
Your grace is immeasurable

57:38.956 --> 57:40.206
Your grace is immeasurable,
Your Majesty

57:40.207 --> 57:42.418
You may leave now

57:53.012 --> 57:56.347
Tell me, Chief

57:56.348 --> 58:00.227
What can I do about the bastards

58:00.394 --> 58:02.645
who squeeze pennies from
the weak and poor?

58:02.646 --> 58:06.649
Order the Royal Investigation Bureau

58:06.650 --> 58:08.444
But that takes too long

58:08.652 --> 58:10.988
I don't know how long
I'll be playing the King

58:11.739 --> 58:13.115
Then

58:13.199 --> 58:14.158
Then?

58:15.326 --> 58:16.659
It's nothing, Sire

58:16.660 --> 58:18.120
Oh, come on!

58:22.166 --> 58:23.250
Tax Minister

58:24.168 --> 58:25.628
Yes, Your Majesty

58:26.128 --> 58:30.841
Did I not command you to
reintroduce the tax reform bill?

58:32.676 --> 58:34.136
Sire

58:34.345 --> 58:38.389
If you change the law overnight,
the burden on landowners

58:38.390 --> 58:40.809
will become unbearable

58:41.018 --> 58:44.437
Do not discriminate landowners
for they are your loyal subjects, too

58:44.438 --> 58:47.857
Taxing 10 bags of rice for those
who own 10 patches of rice paddy

58:47.858 --> 58:51.445
and 1 for those who own 1
How is that discrimination?

58:52.154 --> 58:55.240
When people are voluntarily
becoming slaves and eunuchs,

58:55.241 --> 58:58.160
how can you talk of discrimination
over a landowner's bag of rice?

59:00.246 --> 59:02.081
Bring in the prisoner

59:13.509 --> 59:15.885
That man is the magistrate for Gangwon

59:15.886 --> 59:18.055
who extorted money
from the commoners

59:18.931 --> 59:23.686
The officials
who took bribes from him

59:23.894 --> 59:28.274
and those that took bribes
from those officials

59:28.399 --> 59:32.069
I shall hear all their names

59:33.404 --> 59:39.785
Which of you can swear that
he didn't receive from this man?

59:41.328 --> 59:42.246
Tax Minister!

59:43.163 --> 59:44.038
Yes, Your Majesty

59:44.039 --> 59:49.253
Those who abuse King's tribute
for usury shall be punished severely

59:50.254 --> 59:52.590
As His Majesty orders

59:53.424 --> 59:54.842
Justice Minister

59:55.092 --> 59:56.259
Yes, Your Majesty

59:56.260 --> 59:58.469
Have all magistrates
open their repositories

59:58.470 --> 01:00:02.600
and return all rice and linen
back to the people

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:04.184
Yes, Your Majesty

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:06.395
I command my trusted council

01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:09.315
to have uniform land tax law
enforced immediately

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:13.152
Anyone that obstruct
the execution of this decree

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:18.490
shall be punished
with utmost severity

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:23.370
Your grace is immeasurable

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.149
You're running state affairs
as you please

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:55.402
But we got the uniform land tax law

01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:59.406
Do you even know
who Yu Jeong-ho is?

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.284
You must give to take

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.619
Isn't that what politics is about?

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.496
Politics is no marketplace haggling!

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:09.708
Someone might hear us

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:15.756
Please act more appropriately
around the King

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:29.269
Yu Jeong-ho is

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.855
the Queen's brother

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:33.816
Pardon me?

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:39.029
They are accusing him of treason
in order to depose the Queen

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:42.825
She is the mother of this kingdom

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:46.202
- How dare they?
- Sire

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:47.913
King's taster to see His Majesty

01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:59.883
Let her in

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:09.226
The inquisition makes one confess
to crimes he never committed

01:02:09.685 --> 01:02:12.019
I was prepared to sacrifice
the land tax bill

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.398
in exchange of Yu's life

01:02:15.566 --> 01:02:18.277
What do I do now?

01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:20.404
Absolutely nothing

01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:24.116
If you wish to help me and the Court

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:28.370
Her Royal Highness to see His Majesty

01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:32.040
Tell her I'm in bed

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:45.929
I trusted Your Majesty

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:48.098
If Your Majesty finds me
so unbearable,

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:50.267
grant me the relief of death

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:56.023
What are you doing?

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.239
Can you please drop the knife?

01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:09.077
I shall spare the life of Yu
no matter what

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:11.330
Do you give your word?

01:03:12.915 --> 01:03:14.291
You have my word

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:22.633
Would you please come down?

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:41.276
If Your Majesty doesn't keep his word,

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:44.988
it shall be the death of me

01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:56.250
All right

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:12.099
His Majesty the King!

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.618
Why did you do it?

01:04:32.953 --> 01:04:37.624
You're my brother-in-law
Why did you conspire against me?

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:44.464
Answer me

01:04:47.593 --> 01:04:52.055
Your humble servant
remembers the King

01:04:52.931 --> 01:05:00.931
who always put the benefit
of the people before all

01:05:03.442 --> 01:05:11.442
But you're no longer the King
I swore to serve

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:21.043
Deafened by corrupt officials
and blinded by wicked women,

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.382
you've become nothing but a tyrant

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.093
How dare you,
in the presence of His Majesty?

01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:32.095
So, what did you do?

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.097
Did you plot treason?

01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:37.934
No, my Lord!
Never!

01:05:37.935 --> 01:05:40.729
Did you round up a militia?

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.856
I would never dream of such things

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.608
Then, what did you do?

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:48.946
I pleaded that you open your ears

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:52.616
I called out that you listen

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:58.789
Punish me with death, Your Majesty

01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:03.251
You called out

01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:06.380
That's all?

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:13.803
Release him

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:15.472
Sire, it cannot be done

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:17.974
The man is guilty of treason

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:19.977
What treason?

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:23.563
Minister, can you declare
with a clear conscience

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:29.820
that your intentions are
purer than this man?

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.823
Step forward if you dare say so

01:06:36.952 --> 01:06:38.203
Release him

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:40.747
for he is guilty of no crime

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:55.721
Is that how he wants to play?

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:12.362
Chief

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:17.868
Your Majesty

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.037
I would like to be alone for a moment

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:22.580
But, Sire

01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:25.208
Only for a moment

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:40.891
Retire to your quarters, Captain

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:45.061
It's against the laws of the Court

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:48.857
The laws of the Court are
above the King?

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:08.418
Your Highness,
Yu Jeong-ho was released

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:13.590
What they say about
His Majesty must be true

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:15.549
He laughs more

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:18.428
and at night, focuses
only on state affairs

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.684
Your Highness?

01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:32.692
With Your Highness' permission,
I shall retire

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:42.618
What brings you here, my Lord?

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:58.343
Don't you find it amusing?

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.138
I do, my Lord

01:09:03.515 --> 01:09:05.308
Yet, you do not smile

01:09:11.523 --> 01:09:12.941
Your Majesty

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:21.658
What in Heaven's name?

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.706
Sire?

01:09:30.959 --> 01:09:32.586
Why did you do that?

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:37.631
I released Yu as I promised

01:09:38.258 --> 01:09:39.718
I heard so

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:43.680
You should return the favor

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.060
I'm at your service

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.357
Give me a smile

01:09:56.568 --> 01:09:57.484
I beg your pardon?

01:09:57.485 --> 01:09:59.654
Smile for me once

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:06.703
Is it so hard?
I kept my promise

01:10:09.039 --> 01:10:10.207
Come on

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.398
Your Majesty!

01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:47.827
I shall retire to my chamber

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:59.422
Were you with Her Royal Highness?

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:15.230
What's the matter?

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:17.357
Nothing, Sire

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:20.735
Chief Eunuch

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:30.203
Did you notice anything different
about His Majesty?

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:31.371
How do you mean?

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:35.834
It's not just one or two things

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:40.171
His way of speaking and acting

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:45.260
Even his hands look different

01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:50.557
Captain, you worry too much

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:52.475
If you'll excuse me

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:59.357
Captain Do seems to
have sensed something

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.067
Perhaps we best tell him

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.320
No

01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:08.491
We cannot anticipate
how he would react

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:11.328
His Majesty is coming back
into consciousness

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.246
Just a few more days

01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:22.172
Your Royal Highness

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:26.092
These are the words of His Majesty

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:32.474
Queen's complexion appears poor

01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:36.978
Have this red bean porridge
and regain your health

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:45.612
I heard them
Leave me now

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:47.530
If it pleases Your Highness,

01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:50.075
His Majesty ordered
that I see you have it

01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:53.703
and bring back the empty bowl

01:12:57.332 --> 01:12:59.542
Chief Royal Secretary
to see His Majesty

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:25.943
<i>About Yu Jeong-ho</i>

01:13:25.944 --> 01:13:31.199
Didn't I make it clear not to
interfere with state affairs?

01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:32.826
I know

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:38.957
There are laws in the Court
even for the Queen's siblings

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.168
But surely,
King's words override...

01:13:43.128 --> 01:13:44.421
Wretch!

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:48.007
Don't you know that even the King
cannot act solely upon his will?

01:13:48.967 --> 01:13:51.094
And you are not the King

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:56.266
You said the Court has
eyes and ears everywhere

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.560
Why do you talk to me
in that manner?

01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:02.647
King's taster to see His Majesty

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:19.873
Let her in

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:32.302
Let's see

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:34.929
Cinnamon toffee!

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.390
Wait there, Sa-wol

01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:45.315
Secretary, eat this

01:14:50.612 --> 01:14:51.946
Your grace is immeasurable

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.239
Go on

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.172
Suck it

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:23.436
Chief Secretary is leaving

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.415
Did she have the porridge?

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.251
Yes, Your Majesty

01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:49.420
Did she have a message for me?

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:55.093
Tell His Majesty to come to the garden
when the curfew bell sounds

01:15:55.677 --> 01:15:57.554
for I wish to speak with him

01:15:58.096 --> 01:16:01.975
Her Highness' message for you, Sire

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:03.601
I see

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:09.649
The moon in the sky
is the face of my dearest

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:16.990
Who cut my dearest's head
and hung it up there?

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:23.454
When the moon comes up
I gaze upon it

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:25.832
What do you think?

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:29.419
Excellent, Your Majesty

01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:32.213
What about you, Captain?

01:16:32.839 --> 01:16:36.676
It's befitting the laws of the Court

01:16:40.305 --> 01:16:41.723
And you, Chief?

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:45.101
Who do you refer to as 'moon'?

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:51.024
I cannot tell you

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:54.110
Perhaps it's best not to recite it

01:16:57.363 --> 01:17:01.576
But two people say it's good

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:03.202
Yes?

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.456
Still, it may not be best to...

01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:17.258
Sa-wol

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:18.718
Yes, Your Majesty

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:22.472
Tonight's snack is dried persimmons,
your favorites

01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:24.849
I shall leave it all for you

01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:27.268
Your grace is immeasurable

01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:35.652
Chief, you shall not retire
to your quarters tonight

01:17:35.735 --> 01:17:38.905
for I will stay up to read

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:40.948
Yes, Your Majesty

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:43.450
Your Majesty, it's the curfew bell

01:17:43.451 --> 01:17:44.911
All right

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:54.212
Eunuch Jo, I thought
you were on my side

01:17:55.046 --> 01:18:01.552
On second thought,
it is not a bad idea

01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:03.096
Your Majesty

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:17.026
Wait here

01:18:43.136 --> 01:18:45.930
Do you remember
what you said to me

01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:48.891
on the day I became Princess Consort?

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:51.936
Well...

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:54.354
Of course you forgot

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:56.482
It's been so long

01:18:57.024 --> 01:19:05.024
You held my hand and told me

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:08.953
that you would stay by my side

01:19:09.454 --> 01:19:12.081
until the end of days

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:19.797
I can still hear your voice

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:37.690
It's called 'Face of My Dearest'

01:19:38.775 --> 01:19:43.279
The moon in the sky
is the face of my dearest

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:50.620
Who cut my dearest's head
and hung it up there?

01:19:51.037 --> 01:19:55.541
Alas, how much it must hurt!
She smiles not

01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:59.420
When the moon comes up
I gaze upon it

01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:03.549
wondering if it is my dearest

01:20:08.888 --> 01:20:09.972
What do you think?

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:13.309
How dare you?

01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:15.478
Stand back, Your Highness

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:17.437
This man is not His Majesty

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:18.313
Captain!

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:21.484
You may have fooled
the Secretary and Eunuch Jo

01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:23.151
But you cannot fool me

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.821
Withdraw the sword

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:27.489
How dare you draw your blade
upon the King?

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:32.828
If this man is the King,
I shall bite this blade

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:34.497
It is indeed my Lord the King!

01:20:34.539 --> 01:20:38.334
Do you believe that
I would not recognize my King?

01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:43.381
Your Majesty, I have a small
red birthmark on my body

01:20:43.673 --> 01:20:45.383
Where is it?

01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:55.059
On your left bosom

01:20:56.143 --> 01:20:57.687
Lower that sword at once

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.105
How dare you?

01:20:59.397 --> 01:21:03.526
Will you have me reveal my bosom?

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:09.031
Punish me with death, Your Majesty

01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:12.660
I shall pay for my sins with my life

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:14.871
Long live my King!

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.084
I'll fetch the court ladies

01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:23.296
Madam

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:27.341
Captain! Captain!

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:48.069
Finish this porridge
and come for your sword

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.405
What?

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:54.535
These are the words of His Majesty

01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:01.626
Tell me what your sins are

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:06.963
Drawing a sword upon
Your Majesty's royal person

01:22:06.964 --> 01:22:08.507
Wrong

01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:12.677
Daring to suspect Your Majesty

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.096
Wrong again

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:23.773
King's personal guard who
must protect me with his life

01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:26.734
bit on the blade
to take his own life

01:22:28.194 --> 01:22:30.947
If that does not consist treason,
what would?

01:22:31.656 --> 01:22:35.284
I don't care how many times
you draw the sword at my neck

01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:39.455
But you must live
in order for me to live

01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:44.293
Don't you understand
how important your life is?

01:22:46.504 --> 01:22:48.339
How did the porridge taste?

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:52.760
Sweet and delicious

01:22:53.177 --> 01:22:57.723
You must live
to be able to taste

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:02.895
This sword,

01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:05.147
you shall only draw it
for me alone

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:07.066
Remember that

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:23.749
Do you think he fell for it?

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:27.420
He is a man to be reckoned with

01:23:51.986 --> 01:23:53.696
Sire

01:23:59.076 --> 01:24:01.287
How long was I here?

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:05.332
A fortnight by tomorrow,
Your Majesty

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:19.805
What is that?

01:24:19.889 --> 01:24:21.724
It's poppy, Your Majesty

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.478
It's the poison that clouded your mind

01:24:26.187 --> 01:24:28.147
Your Majesty

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:29.940
Who would do such a thing?

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:34.153
It was Court Lady Ahn

01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:41.118
Minister Park Chung-seo
was behind this?

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.204
Yes, Your Majesty

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:45.790
What an evil man!

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:50.585
I'll prepare for your return at once
and reveal their atrocious crimes

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:51.921
No

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:58.301
There is no need for rush

01:24:58.302 --> 01:24:59.470
But, Sire

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:03.140
The Court is in the hands
of Park Chung-seo

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:06.102
An ill-prepared attack
would only backfire

01:25:06.602 --> 01:25:11.232
After all, it wasn't poison

01:25:12.983 --> 01:25:17.947
Let's take care of the double first

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:23.410
What is the matter?

01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:28.999
You care for him now?

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.128
No, Sire

01:25:33.087 --> 01:25:38.342
You can't spare the lowly thing
who sat on the throne

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:49.353
We beg Your Majesty to take heed

01:25:49.603 --> 01:25:50.813
Your Majesty

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:54.149
As long as the daughter of a Northerner
remains the Queen

01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:56.318
plots of treason shall not cease

01:25:56.527 --> 01:25:58.988
Are you suggesting that
my Queen is the root of treason?

01:25:59.113 --> 01:26:05.035
In the center of all conspiracies
were the relatives of the Queen

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:09.957
Your Majesty must uphold
the laws of the Court

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:14.044
Are you telling me that
ditching the Queen like a dog

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:15.838
would be the law of the Court?

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:17.089
Your Majesty

01:26:17.173 --> 01:26:20.383
You made a promise
that you would depose the Queen

01:26:20.384 --> 01:26:25.514
and make the concubine who
carries a royal heir new Queen

01:26:25.598 --> 01:26:28.517
Grant your royal permission

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:31.604
Grant your royal permission

01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:38.360
We beg Your Majesty to take heed

01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:49.205
I shall depose the Queen
as you advise me

01:26:50.331 --> 01:26:51.498
However,

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:55.669
if the Queen must be deposed
for not being Westerners like you

01:26:55.753 --> 01:26:58.047
I shall depose myself as well

01:26:58.714 --> 01:27:02.384
since I'm not a Westerner myself

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.681
Withdraw your command,
Your Majesty

01:27:07.765 --> 01:27:10.558
Withdraw your command,
Your Majesty

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:11.643
Your Majesty

01:27:11.644 --> 01:27:15.522
Withdraw your command!
Your Majesty!

01:27:16.482 --> 01:27:19.318
I beg Your Majesty to take heed
Your Majesty

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:22.528
We beg Your Majesty to take heed

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:23.738
Get out of my way

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:27.784
Tread on our backs if you must

01:27:27.785 --> 01:27:29.411
Your Majesty

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:33.082
Tread on our backs, Your Majesty

01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:44.194
Your Majesty

01:28:44.403 --> 01:28:45.571
Your Majesty

01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:46.655
Your Majesty

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.865
Your Majesty

01:28:48.073 --> 01:28:50.075
Your Majesty

01:29:03.339 --> 01:29:04.965
Your Majesty

01:29:13.557 --> 01:29:15.434
<i>Where are you going?</i>

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:17.353
<i>I don't know</i>

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.189
<i>Please stop</i>

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:22.242
<i>We'll still be within
the walls of the Court</i>

01:29:22.358 --> 01:29:24.068
<i>Leave this palace, Madam</i>

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:27.905
<i>You can hide for a while
then leave</i>

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:31.533
<i>I'm the King I can do as I wish</i>

01:29:43.212 --> 01:29:44.296
Your Majesty!

01:29:46.215 --> 01:29:47.424
Your Majesty!

01:29:52.179 --> 01:29:53.097
Your Majesty!

01:29:55.766 --> 01:29:58.394
No one passes this gate, understood?

01:29:58.435 --> 01:30:00.312
But, the laws of the Court

01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:02.856
I'm counting on you

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:17.204
Why are you doing this?

01:30:17.413 --> 01:30:18.413
Madam

01:30:18.414 --> 01:30:21.250
Why have pity on me?

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:27.423
Do you feel sorry now that
my end is coming?

01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:32.970
Return to your quarters

01:30:38.642 --> 01:30:40.644
You said I promised!

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:46.984
That I would stay by your side

01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:50.028
until the end of days

01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:56.118
That I would never let go
of your hand

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.629
Don't make me cry, my Lord

01:31:16.138 --> 01:31:17.973
What do you mean
there are two kings?

01:31:18.265 --> 01:31:19.516
Did you see with your own eyes?

01:31:19.683 --> 01:31:21.310
Yes, my Lord

01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:23.061
I see

01:31:28.775 --> 01:31:30.444
If one is an imposter

01:31:30.903 --> 01:31:34.239
what will happen
if one of them disappears?

01:31:35.115 --> 01:31:41.288
First of all, we'll make sure
which is the real King

01:31:47.336 --> 01:31:48.795
Did you look into it?

01:31:49.338 --> 01:31:56.470
On the 3rd and 6th when
the King was out on a night trip

01:31:56.762 --> 01:31:59.181
night snack was served
in the King's quarters

01:32:00.098 --> 01:32:01.558
Are you certain of it?

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:06.688
It's recorded in the journal
and I checked with the matron

01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:10.609
Good work

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:32.548
<i>Did you hear the horrid rumors</i>

01:32:33.382 --> 01:32:36.593
<i>that His Majesty is not the real King?</i>

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:41.265
<i>Also, the scar on His Majesty's chest
seems to have disappeared</i>

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:48.313
Is Lady Jeong there?

01:33:10.419 --> 01:33:12.337
I shall get going

01:33:12.421 --> 01:33:13.922
Please stay

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:19.261
Get in the bed, Your Majesty

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:22.931
I must go see about an urgent matter

01:33:24.474 --> 01:33:29.354
You are my dear husband
before you're my King

01:33:29.438 --> 01:33:32.107
It's the will of the Heavens
that husband and wife unite

01:33:32.274 --> 01:33:34.109
Please take off your robe

01:33:37.195 --> 01:33:40.324
Queen, no!
You can't!

01:33:40.449 --> 01:33:41.533
You mustn't do this

01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:43.327
Madam

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:45.996
Madam
Please

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:51.168
Madam

01:34:09.019 --> 01:34:10.520
Reveal your identity

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:16.901
What do you mean?
I'm the 15th King of Joseon

01:34:16.902 --> 01:34:21.657
Do you wish to be dead?

01:34:28.789 --> 01:34:30.415
Leave at once

01:34:30.874 --> 01:34:35.045
Do you believe you'll live
when the King returns?

01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:38.965
Screams will fill the Court again

01:34:39.216 --> 01:34:42.594
and I shall one day be deposed

01:34:42.969 --> 01:34:50.143
Your lowly body shall be
thrown in some river

01:34:53.063 --> 01:34:55.607
Where is the King?

01:34:55.774 --> 01:34:59.820
Forgive me, Your Highness
This is the command of the King

01:35:00.153 --> 01:35:08.153
Holding his whereabouts in secret,
having an imposter take his place

01:35:09.162 --> 01:35:16.211
And saving my brother?
All of it was the King's wish?

01:35:19.089 --> 01:35:21.717
Or was it yours, Secretary?

01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:27.556
Your Highness

01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:30.225
Please turn a blind eye to it
for a few more days

01:35:31.977 --> 01:35:34.730
What will happen when this is over?

01:35:37.441 --> 01:35:43.697
To the man that looks like the King

01:35:46.742 --> 01:35:48.577
The Queen knows about it

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:54.583
She said that I shall be killed

01:35:56.585 --> 01:36:00.630
That if the officials let me live,
the King shall have me killed

01:36:02.841 --> 01:36:08.805
You should've run
Why did you come back?

01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:14.644
I remembered the promise

01:36:26.782 --> 01:36:28.366
Take this

01:36:28.575 --> 01:36:31.453
20 more silver coins as I promised

01:36:33.455 --> 01:36:38.627
I ask you if my life is worth
less than that of a chicken

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:40.629
Shut up and listen

01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:44.758
Leave the Court tomorrow
at the darkest hour of the night

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:50.472
You have never seen me
nor spoken to me

01:36:54.476 --> 01:36:58.146
This is the royal creed
for tomorrow's conference

01:36:58.396 --> 01:37:02.067
Just tell them to do as they see fit

01:37:02.818 --> 01:37:07.697
That will be your last mission
as the King's stand-in

01:37:12.077 --> 01:37:13.160
Sire

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:15.580
Sa-wol to see His Majesty

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:26.800
I have a favor for you, Secretary

01:37:28.051 --> 01:37:32.597
I promised her
that I would find her mother

01:37:34.432 --> 01:37:36.768
Please see to the matter
on my behalf

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:42.315
Sa-wol

01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:45.527
Take it

01:37:46.862 --> 01:37:50.198
It's no longer of use for me

01:37:51.533 --> 01:37:53.326
Go on

01:38:22.856 --> 01:38:27.027
Find her mother and
get her back to her

01:38:28.445 --> 01:38:33.033
This is not a favor

01:38:34.993 --> 01:38:38.580
but my last royal command to you

01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:47.380
Sa-wol

01:38:48.298 --> 01:38:50.050
It's a cinnamon sweet

01:38:50.425 --> 01:38:52.886
Put it in your mouth
and slip it in the porridge

01:38:53.595 --> 01:38:58.516
My Lady, what's in the sweet?

01:38:58.934 --> 01:39:00.435
I don't know

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:04.980
All I know is that if you don't do it

01:39:04.981 --> 01:39:07.859
it'll be the death of you and me

01:39:19.788 --> 01:39:22.457
I heard it was you that ordered
the release of my brother

01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:24.876
Why did you do it?

01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:29.130
Why did you go out of your way?

01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:38.974
I thought if I did,
I could make you smile

01:39:40.767 --> 01:39:44.187
A bright smile on your face

01:39:46.856 --> 01:39:51.486
I'll leave the palace tomorrow night
when the moon is at its highest

01:39:52.612 --> 01:39:58.284
I don't care if you stay in the Court
or get thrown out

01:40:02.163 --> 01:40:04.624
Please stay alive

01:41:03.725 --> 01:41:07.062
Including 45,000 silver coins

01:41:07.353 --> 01:41:14.444
70 tributes in 13 categories prepared
for the Imperial Palace of Ming

01:41:14.986 --> 01:41:22.034
I propose Your Majesty to bestow
8 pounds of gold upon the envoy

01:41:22.035 --> 01:41:24.245
What a splendid idea!

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:27.957
Do as you see fit

01:41:30.919 --> 01:41:33.253
As for troop dispatch
I propose 500 horses

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:35.756
3,000 archers and 1,000 cavalrymen

01:41:35.757 --> 01:41:38.927
to be included
in the troop of 20,000 soldiers

01:41:38.968 --> 01:41:44.681
Pulling 20,000 soldiers could make
the northern borders vulnerable

01:41:44.682 --> 01:41:52.648
This country only exists
because of Ming Dynasty

01:41:52.649 --> 01:41:55.609
Even if we get traded over
by the savages

01:41:55.610 --> 01:42:00.615
it is only right to pay our respect
to the Emperor of Ming

01:42:01.032 --> 01:42:03.159
Grant your royal permission,
Your Majesty

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:06.162
Grant your royal permission

01:42:06.955 --> 01:42:08.832
Do as you see fit

01:42:09.415 --> 01:42:13.795
Next is the tribute for
Grand Empress Dowager

01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:17.090
40 court ladies

01:42:17.132 --> 01:42:20.300
150 rolls of beige fine ramie,
150 rolls of white fine ramie

01:42:20.301 --> 01:42:23.096
- 60 sable furs and silk
- Enough! Enough!

01:42:25.765 --> 01:42:27.934
Whose country is this?

01:42:30.603 --> 01:42:32.063
What?

01:42:33.273 --> 01:42:36.234
Even if we get
traded over by the savages?

01:42:36.818 --> 01:42:38.778
If you fancy the Emperor of Ming so much

01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:40.696
why don't you hand over
this entire country to him?

01:42:40.697 --> 01:42:42.991
- Your Majesty!
- Shame on you

01:42:56.462 --> 01:43:03.887
Fine! I shall dispatch
20,000 soldiers to Ming

01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:07.724
But at the same time,
I shall write to Jin

01:43:08.141 --> 01:43:09.684
Write down my words

01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:14.355
I dispatched 20,000 soldiers to Ming
in fear of the Emperor

01:43:14.397 --> 01:43:16.691
but I have no wish to fight Jin

01:43:17.442 --> 01:43:22.363
I ask of the good King of Jin
to return my soldiers unharmed

01:43:22.488 --> 01:43:25.365
How can you turn your back
on our diplomatic policy

01:43:25.366 --> 01:43:27.826
and reach out to the savages?

01:43:27.827 --> 01:43:30.246
Just how important is state policy

01:43:30.622 --> 01:43:35.001
that we must force our good people
to fight someone else's war?

01:43:36.628 --> 01:43:42.634
As the King that people
refer to as their husband

01:43:43.551 --> 01:43:47.472
I may steal and take from them

01:43:47.764 --> 01:43:49.891
but I shall not drive them to death

01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:53.895
To me, my country and my people
are hundred folds more precious

01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:59.067
than the virtues of state policy

01:44:44.946 --> 01:44:47.156
Let's see

01:44:58.251 --> 01:45:03.965
This porridge tastes better than ever

01:45:05.133 --> 01:45:08.428
I shall never forget this taste

01:45:16.769 --> 01:45:18.146
Sa-wol

01:45:27.155 --> 01:45:28.948
Why do you cry, child?

01:45:36.205 --> 01:45:37.665
Sa-wol?

01:45:40.585 --> 01:45:48.585
Long live my King

01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:55.516
Sa-wol, Sa-wol

01:45:56.351 --> 01:45:57.477
Sa-wol

01:45:57.769 --> 01:45:59.144
Please put the child down

01:45:59.145 --> 01:46:00.646
Is anyone there?

01:46:00.772 --> 01:46:01.981
Your Majesty

01:46:05.526 --> 01:46:06.861
Your Majesty

01:46:09.197 --> 01:46:14.202
You must live

01:46:20.041 --> 01:46:21.542
Is anyone there?

01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:23.669
- Anyone out there?
- Your Majesty

01:46:34.389 --> 01:46:35.556
Sa-wol

01:46:37.517 --> 01:46:41.562
Bring her back

01:46:50.154 --> 01:46:51.489
Tell me, child

01:46:52.365 --> 01:46:54.409
Who gave you poison?

01:47:00.706 --> 01:47:01.958
Tell me

01:47:02.417 --> 01:47:06.003
I'm the King

01:48:24.916 --> 01:48:26.125
Your Majesty

01:48:26.375 --> 01:48:29.003
Punish me with death

01:48:29.045 --> 01:48:31.047
I was instigated by Constable Lee

01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:34.383
He said that if I didn't do it
he'll have us killed

01:48:34.509 --> 01:48:36.219
He made me do it

01:48:36.344 --> 01:48:38.513
Punish me with death

01:48:38.804 --> 01:48:39.680
Captain Do

01:48:39.764 --> 01:48:41.224
Yes, Your Majesty

01:48:41.766 --> 01:48:43.601
Have the Constable arrested
and brought to me

01:48:45.311 --> 01:48:46.228
Your Majesty

01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:49.524
If he resists, execute him

01:48:49.565 --> 01:48:50.983
Yes, Your Majesty

01:48:56.614 --> 01:48:58.282
You killed her

01:48:58.324 --> 01:49:02.537
No, Your Majesty
I was framed

01:49:03.204 --> 01:49:06.207
Let's see how long
you'll be saying that

01:49:16.008 --> 01:49:19.427
We'll all be sent to the death row

01:49:19.428 --> 01:49:20.929
That man is not the King

01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:24.891
How can the King of Joseon
desire to befriend the savages?

01:49:24.892 --> 01:49:28.854
Whether he is the King or not
we cannot let him do this

01:49:28.896 --> 01:49:30.731
Who put him on that throne?

01:49:30.815 --> 01:49:32.900
How can he treat us like this?

01:49:38.072 --> 01:49:40.408
The King is not the King?

01:49:41.284 --> 01:49:42.826
You expect me to believe that?

01:49:42.827 --> 01:49:43.995
Prime Minister

01:49:44.078 --> 01:49:48.541
Do you remember the scar
on His Majesty's chest?

01:49:48.583 --> 01:49:52.420
From the arrow he was hit by
during the Japanese Invasion?

01:49:53.379 --> 01:49:55.423
Tell us what you saw

01:50:00.094 --> 01:50:02.638
Isn't she the King's maid?

01:50:03.764 --> 01:50:09.520
I haven't seen that scar for weeks

01:50:09.645 --> 01:50:11.314
How do you mean?

01:50:14.442 --> 01:50:17.777
Can you bet your life on that?

01:50:17.778 --> 01:50:20.656
How can I tell lies here?

01:50:22.283 --> 01:50:23.534
How can this be?

01:50:23.618 --> 01:50:26.454
Bring me the Chief Scholar

01:50:26.537 --> 01:50:28.539
Is anyone there?

01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:33.294
Park Chung-seo
got the officials together

01:50:34.086 --> 01:50:36.005
They'll strike with guards any minute

01:50:36.631 --> 01:50:39.592
Take off the royal robe and leave

01:50:40.718 --> 01:50:41.927
No

01:50:45.014 --> 01:50:49.602
Until now,
I've lived as a lowly man

01:50:50.478 --> 01:50:56.108
but I shall not move an inch
before I avenge Sa-wol's death

01:50:59.236 --> 01:51:04.450
Then, you should become a real king

01:51:11.499 --> 01:51:14.502
Should you wish to avenge her death

01:51:15.836 --> 01:51:19.340
and bring justice upon those
that suck on people's blood

01:51:19.757 --> 01:51:22.343
A king that serves his people
like the Heaven

01:51:22.426 --> 01:51:25.429
If that's the king you wish to be,

01:51:28.182 --> 01:51:32.687
I shall make it happen

01:51:57.169 --> 01:51:58.504
I...

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.722
I wish to be King

01:52:12.059 --> 01:52:14.019
Go to the Royal Secretariat

01:52:14.061 --> 01:52:15.980
and bring me the journal
for the last fortnight

01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:19.900
Steal it! Take it from
their hands if you must

01:53:18.542 --> 01:53:20.127
Go, Your Majesty

01:53:21.086 --> 01:53:23.380
Make haste, Sire

01:53:24.507 --> 01:53:28.803
You told Sa-wol to stay alive

01:53:29.970 --> 01:53:33.516
Dying in a robe is
a death all the same

01:53:34.558 --> 01:53:36.227
Run

01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:40.231
Run for your life

01:53:51.575 --> 01:53:52.993
Stand back

01:53:55.162 --> 01:53:56.705
You're in presence of the King

01:53:57.081 --> 01:53:58.999
Step aside, Secretary!

01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:07.007
We're not here to rise against the King

01:54:07.466 --> 01:54:09.467
but to bring down an imposter

01:54:09.468 --> 01:54:15.516
How dare you speak of such a thing?

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:21.188
We shall see whether he is
the real King or not

01:54:21.897 --> 01:54:23.566
- Chief Royal Guard
- Yes, sir

01:54:23.774 --> 01:54:24.934
Pull the traitor out of there

01:54:29.154 --> 01:54:33.367
His Majesty the King!

01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:02.146
How dare you?

01:55:02.563 --> 01:55:05.232
Exercise due courtesy for your King

01:55:05.858 --> 01:55:09.570
Sitting on the throne must have
made you crazy

01:55:09.904 --> 01:55:14.408
Who are you calling an imposter?

01:55:20.915 --> 01:55:22.917
I'm the King

01:55:25.002 --> 01:55:26.587
Are you really?

01:55:27.171 --> 01:55:31.926
If he is indeed the King,
he'll have a scar on his chest

01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:34.929
If not, he is an imposter

01:55:36.388 --> 01:55:38.432
Isn't that true, Secretary?

01:55:39.767 --> 01:55:41.769
Take off his robe

01:55:50.986 --> 01:55:53.530
How dare you insult me like this?

01:55:54.365 --> 01:55:57.034
I shall have your head

01:56:41.578 --> 01:56:42.997
Your Majesty

01:56:52.339 --> 01:56:55.175
Should you wish to avenge
Sa-wol's death

01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:58.804
and bring justice upon those
that suck on people's blood

01:56:59.638 --> 01:57:02.099
A king that serves his people
like the Heaven

01:57:02.474 --> 01:57:05.269
If that's the king you wish to be,

01:57:07.229 --> 01:57:12.317
I shall make it happen

01:57:14.069 --> 01:57:19.199
I wish to be King

01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:27.833
But if being King means

01:57:29.418 --> 01:57:32.046
taking others' lives to save mine

01:57:36.216 --> 01:57:41.972
I shall not have it

01:57:49.646 --> 01:57:56.612
I shall dream my own dreams

01:58:14.505 --> 01:58:19.176
I served two kings

01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:28.936
This is the Royal Secretariat's journal
of the last fortnight

01:58:29.770 --> 01:58:31.188
Please review it

01:58:31.647 --> 01:58:37.027
If you judge that I've been disloyal,
take this servant's head

01:59:03.846 --> 01:59:05.764
<i>Have all magistrates
open their repositories</i>

01:59:05.806 --> 01:59:09.601
<i>and return all rice and linen
back to the people</i>

01:59:10.519 --> 01:59:13.147
<i>to have uniform land tax law
enforced immediately</i>

01:59:14.022 --> 01:59:17.233
<i>I may steal and take from them</i>

01:59:17.234 --> 01:59:19.153
<i>but I shall not drive them to death</i>

01:59:20.028 --> 01:59:22.990
<i>To me, my country and my people
are hundred folds more precious</i>

01:59:23.031 --> 01:59:27.953
<i>than the virtues of state policy</i>

01:59:43.302 --> 01:59:48.515
Do you doubt me even with this scar?

01:59:50.017 --> 01:59:51.727
Your Majesty!

01:59:51.768 --> 01:59:55.189
Punish us with death, Your Majesty!

01:59:55.522 --> 01:59:59.443
Round up the traitors

01:59:59.735 --> 02:00:01.695
Royal command shall be upheld

02:00:15.667 --> 02:00:17.044
Stop

02:00:45.864 --> 02:00:47.241
Go

02:00:48.617 --> 02:00:51.078
You'll find a port
at the end of the path

02:00:52.204 --> 02:00:56.333
Make haste

02:01:02.130 --> 02:01:04.424
Don't look back

02:01:34.162 --> 02:01:35.455
Step aside

02:01:35.956 --> 02:01:37.291
I'm here on royal command

02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:40.669
I abide by the laws of the Court

02:01:41.753 --> 02:01:43.588
If you intend to hurt him,

02:01:45.590 --> 02:01:46.883
you must kill me first

02:01:46.925 --> 02:01:50.554
Captain, that man is an imposter

02:01:50.971 --> 02:01:52.973
He is not the real King

02:01:54.266 --> 02:01:56.810
Maybe not to you

02:01:58.312 --> 02:02:01.940
But to me, he is the real King

02:07:26.973 --> 02:07:28.265
<i>In August of the following year</i>

02:07:28.266 --> 02:07:31.144
<i>Chief Royal Secretary, Heo Gyun,
was executed on charges of treason</i>

02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:35.398
<i>5 years later, King Gwanghae
was deposed with a coup</i>

02:07:38.652 --> 02:07:42.489
<i>Gwanghae is the only king
in the history of Joseon</i>

02:07:44.032 --> 02:07:47.118
<i>who imposed tax only on landowners</i>

02:07:48.370 --> 02:07:52.248
<i>and confronted Ming Dynasty
to protect his people</i>

02:07:55.835 --> 02:07:58.630
<i>A CHOO CHANG-MIN Film</i>
