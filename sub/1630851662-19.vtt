WEBVTT

00:22.147 --> 00:23.481
Three-and-a-half months

00:23.565 --> 00:25.400
to collect
and assemble materials,

00:25.483 --> 00:28.778
and it takes him less than
ten minutes to install them?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.363
Yeah, sorry it took so long,

00:30.447 --> 00:31.948
but incorporating
these rebuilt components

00:32.031 --> 00:34.993
from your dead Time-Sphere
was a real time suck.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.786
-Is it ready?
-"Is it ready?"

00:36.870 --> 00:38.037
It's almost ready.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.290
I could finish it now.
Easy peasy.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.791
-But?
-But I won't.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.294
Not until you finally
tell me everything.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.962
-But the timeline--
-Oh, please.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.589
I'm not even
from this timeline.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.466
I'm a wild card, yo.
A free radical.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.176
That's why you came to me.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.928
So spill, or we're done.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.100
All right, we're here.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.311
We remain out of sync
with the time stream,

01:01.394 --> 01:03.313
so we're undetectable.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.814
But I'll have to risk syncing.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.941
Isn't it time you explained
our mission, Lor-Zod?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.359
I've told you
what you need to do.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.236
What, not why.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.114
Darkseid ordered you
to obey me.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.491
And we will.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.786
But only a fool
goes into a mission blind.

01:17.869 --> 01:20.580
And the Ma'alefa'ak is no fool.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.291
So spill, or were done.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.172
[theme music playing]

01:59.160 --> 02:00.662
[ethereal music playing]

02:08.628 --> 02:10.463
New Genesis.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.090
Breathtaking.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.551
Yeah, I guess the scenery
will be nice to look at

02:14.634 --> 02:16.886
while we totally waste our time
at the summit.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.889
You do not harbor high hopes
for this conference?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.641
Surely between the New Gods,

02:21.724 --> 02:24.269
the Justice League
and the Green Lantern Corps--

02:24.352 --> 02:25.562
Da-da-da-da. Tomar-Re,

02:25.645 --> 02:27.897
there's an old proverb
by Bolovax Vik.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.316
"You want nothing done,
form a committee."

02:30.400 --> 02:31.401
[beeping]

02:31.484 --> 02:33.611
Emergency distress call.
Hit it.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.406
[intense music playing]

02:36.489 --> 02:38.199
There!

02:38.283 --> 02:39.784
[Tomar-Re] It appears
to be a member
of the Blue Lantern Corps.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.911
His life support aura
rapidly fades.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.830
-I suggest--
-[Kilowog] Way ahead of you.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.915
Branwilla's Ghost!

02:45.999 --> 02:47.917
This ain't no Blue Lantern.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.461
-[chuckles] This is Razer!
-Kilowog?

02:50.545 --> 02:51.421
[grunts]

02:51.504 --> 02:53.423
It is as I feared. [exclaims]

02:53.506 --> 02:54.632
I am dead

02:54.716 --> 02:56.509
and in
The Place of Eternal Torment.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.636
Great to see ya, kid.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.014
Ah, hey, nice duds.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.640
You're coming up
in the world.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.560
Leave it to a hothead like you
to planet-hop

03:05.643 --> 03:08.479
without a fully charged
power ring, huh?

03:08.563 --> 03:11.524
-[laughs]
-It is fully charged,

03:11.608 --> 03:14.736
but a blue ring
requires hope to function,

03:14.819 --> 03:17.030
and I am all out of hope.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.995
New Genesis officially welcomes

03:24.078 --> 03:26.205
the Justice League
to the summit.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.290
Thank you, Orion.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.708
Greetings, Rocket.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.460
Vykin. [chuckles]

03:30.543 --> 03:32.295
Good to see a friendly face.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.631
Were you short
on friendly faces here?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.341
[sighs] I admit

03:36.424 --> 03:40.470
I was dreading negotiations
with the Dog of War over there.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.014
-Then you must
not understand him.
-No?

03:43.097 --> 03:45.183
He's Darkseid's son, right?

03:45.266 --> 03:48.186
Orion is the son of
Highmother and Highfather.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.647
You need to take a closer look,
my friend.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.149
Greetings, Lantern.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.109
Do you attend
this summit alone?

03:55.193 --> 03:58.655
Oh, Green Lantern Kilowog
will be along shortly.

03:58.738 --> 04:02.158
He had personal business
to attend to.

04:02.241 --> 04:03.326
[Kilowog]<i> Four years.</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:04.744
Four years!

04:04.827 --> 04:07.413
You don't call,
you don't send subspace mail.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.999
And suddenly you're here
wearing blue pajamas.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.960
Spill it, Red. Uh, Blue.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.003
You have not changed a bit,
my friend.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.547
Unfortunately, neither have I.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.218
<i>Shortly after we parted,</i>

04:20.301 --> 04:22.762
<i>a blue lantern ring</i>
<i>powered by hope</i>

04:22.845 --> 04:25.682
<i>found me in deepest space.</i>

04:25.765 --> 04:28.977
<i>I took it is as a sign</i>
<i>to finally abandon my anger</i>

04:29.060 --> 04:30.687
<i>and gladly did so.</i>

04:30.770 --> 04:33.439
<i>I could not in good conscience</i>
<i>release my red ring</i>

04:33.523 --> 04:36.401
<i>to plague some other</i>
<i>wrath-filled wretch.</i>

04:36.484 --> 04:38.653
<i>So I carried it with me.</i>

04:38.736 --> 04:41.948
<i>A grim reminder of my past.</i>

04:42.031 --> 04:44.325
<i>A chance meeting</i>
<i>with the New God, Metron,</i>

04:44.409 --> 04:46.202
<i>provided a solution.</i>

04:46.286 --> 04:49.330
<i>He would hold the red ring</i>
<i>in his interdimensional vault</i>

04:49.414 --> 04:52.417
<i>while I continued my quest.</i>

04:52.500 --> 04:55.044
But said quest
has proven fruitless.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.213
There were many
promising clues,

04:57.296 --> 04:59.674
but each led
to another dead end.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.719
Hey, come on, kid,
don't give up hope.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.720
Don't you see?

05:03.803 --> 05:05.221
I've already lost all hope.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.557
Only my rage remains
to power my quest.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.977
So I've come to New Genesis
to get my red ring back.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.398
[Forager]
Supertown is indeed beautiful.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.316
Wouldn't Forager agree?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.194
Forager?

05:20.278 --> 05:23.489
[sighs]
Forager apologizes to Forager,

05:23.573 --> 05:25.033
but Forager must admit

05:25.116 --> 05:28.036
Forager is surprised Forager
gave up Forager's seat

05:28.119 --> 05:29.412
at the conference.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.622
Forager would not have
made such a choice.

05:31.706 --> 05:35.209
Forager trusts Rocket and Flash
to handle the summit.

05:35.293 --> 05:39.088
And Forager would prefer
to spend Forager's time

05:39.172 --> 05:40.965
getting to know Forager.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.552
[both chirping]

05:50.099 --> 05:52.810
Okay, hit me with it.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.189
[sighs] The Phantom Zone.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.899
Krypton's
extra-dimensional prison.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.692
But the Kryptonians
never intended

05:59.776 --> 06:01.444
to imprison criminals
for eternity.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.321
[scoffs] That would
have been too cruel.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.282
Unfortunately,
Krypton was destroyed

06:06.365 --> 06:07.909
<i>when its sun exploded.</i>

06:07.992 --> 06:09.410
[explosion]

06:10.328 --> 06:11.662
So, no Kryptonians survived

06:11.746 --> 06:13.289
to release
the Phantom Zone prisoners

06:13.372 --> 06:14.540
when their sentences ended.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.125
So when the last
Phantom Zone projector

06:16.209 --> 06:17.752
was discovered on New Genesis,

06:17.835 --> 06:20.588
<i>the United Planets paroled</i>
<i>every single inmate</i>

06:20.671 --> 06:22.965
<i>as each one had been</i>
<i>trapped in the zone</i>

06:23.049 --> 06:25.760
<i>for over a thousand years.</i>

06:25.843 --> 06:27.970
When my parents
were unjustly imprisoned

06:28.054 --> 06:30.139
in the Phantom Zone,
not even my mother knew

06:30.223 --> 06:32.100
that she was already pregnant.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.894
<i>As no one ages or dies there,</i>

06:34.977 --> 06:37.855
<i>she had the honor</i>
<i>of unknowingly carrying</i>

06:37.939 --> 06:41.651
<i>the scion of General Dru-Zod</i>
<i>for a millennium.</i>

06:41.734 --> 06:46.030
<i>Eight months after their</i>
<i>parole in the 31st century,</i>

06:46.114 --> 06:47.615
<i>I arrived.</i>

06:47.698 --> 06:49.784
<i>The frightened bureaucrats</i>
<i>of the United Planets</i>

06:49.867 --> 06:51.244
<i>had settled all of us</i>

06:51.327 --> 06:52.829
<i>on the Kryptonian</i>
<i>colony world, Daxam,</i>

06:52.912 --> 06:54.831
<i>a planet orbiting a red sun,</i>

06:54.914 --> 06:57.333
<i>thus preventing us</i>
<i>from gaining the powers</i>

06:57.416 --> 06:58.876
<i>that were our birthright.</i>

06:58.960 --> 07:01.671
<i>But they didn't count on</i>
<i>my father's ingenuity.</i>

07:01.754 --> 07:03.506
<i>By the time I turned 15,</i>

07:03.589 --> 07:05.341
<i>he'd smuggled</i>
<i>his loyal followers</i>

07:05.424 --> 07:07.385
<i>along with</i>
<i>like-minded Daxamites</i>

07:07.468 --> 07:10.638
<i>to a nearby planet</i>
<i>under a yellow sun.</i>

07:10.721 --> 07:12.431
<i>Now that we have</i>
<i>our rightful powers,</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:14.100
<i>my father made</i>
<i>a valiant attempt</i>

07:14.183 --> 07:16.102
<i>to lead a rebellion</i>
<i>against the United Planets</i>

07:16.185 --> 07:17.979
<i>for the good of the Galaxy.</i>

07:18.062 --> 07:19.772
General Zod was a menace,

07:19.856 --> 07:22.024
determined to
assert his dominance

07:22.108 --> 07:24.277
over everyone and everything.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.529
Fortunately, the newly formed

07:26.612 --> 07:28.781
<i>Legion of Super Heroes</i>
<i>defeated Zod</i>

07:28.865 --> 07:30.908
<i>with very</i>
<i>Phantom Zone projector</i>

07:30.992 --> 07:32.869
<i>that had released him</i>
<i>from prison.</i>

07:32.952 --> 07:34.829
The damn Legion put my parents

07:34.912 --> 07:37.498
and their army of patriots
back into the Zone,

07:37.582 --> 07:39.834
depriving the galaxy
of true leadership.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.211
But because Lor-Zod
was still a teenager,

07:42.295 --> 07:44.505
they didn't
consider him culpable,

07:44.589 --> 07:46.048
and to our sorrow,

07:46.132 --> 07:48.509
he wasn't sent to the Zone.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.804
I was raised
to despise the Family El.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.389
Chief Scientist Jor-El

07:53.472 --> 07:56.434
had exposed my father's attempt
to save Krypton

07:56.517 --> 07:57.935
from its own weakness.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.396
Meaning Zod
had attempted a coup.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.064
Call it what you will.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.526
What is certain is that Jor-El
conspired with his brother,

08:05.610 --> 08:07.111
<i>Chief Examiner Zor-El,</i>

08:07.195 --> 08:09.780
<i>to sentence my parents</i>
<i>to the Zone.</i>

08:09.864 --> 08:11.240
I didn't think
I could hate anyone

08:11.324 --> 08:12.783
as much as
I hated the Els.

08:12.867 --> 08:16.329
But now, there was the Legion.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.872
Lor-Zod was relentless

08:17.955 --> 08:20.041
in his attempts
to acquire the projector.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.500
Finally,

08:21.584 --> 08:24.754
<i>the Legion had no choice</i>
<i>but to destroy it.</i>

08:24.837 --> 08:26.714
The Legion had
permanently consigned

08:26.797 --> 08:30.176
my mother and father to
the hell of the Phantom Zone.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.552
And this Legion,

08:31.636 --> 08:34.764
who do you think
inspired its very existence?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.766
<i>Superboy, Kon-El,</i>

08:36.849 --> 08:39.101
<i>a member of that</i>
<i>accursed El family.</i>

08:39.185 --> 08:40.978
<i>That made him twice my enemy.</i>

08:41.062 --> 08:42.521
<i>So planning ahead,</i>

08:42.605 --> 08:46.776
<i>I stole the last known sample</i>
<i>of kryptonite</i>

08:46.859 --> 08:48.945
<i>and this Time-Sphere.</i>

08:49.028 --> 08:52.156
[Saturn girl]
<i>So Chameleon Boy,</i>
<i>Phantom Girl, and I</i>

08:52.240 --> 08:54.992
<i>were pursuing Lor</i>
<i>when he escaped to the past.</i>

08:55.076 --> 08:58.120
<i>Chroniton radiation</i>
<i>from his stolen sphere</i>

08:58.204 --> 08:59.205
washed over us.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.623
Making the three of you immune

09:00.706 --> 09:02.333
to the changes Lor made
to the timestream.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.335
Been there, irradiated by that.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.587
We tried to contact Legion HQ.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.215
But there was no Legion HQ.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.509
A quick data search
of the new timeline

09:11.592 --> 09:15.304
revealed that Lor had killed
Superboy in the past,

09:15.388 --> 09:18.432
and without
Conner Kent's inspiration,

09:18.516 --> 09:20.059
the Legion had never formed.

09:20.142 --> 09:23.020
[sighs]
With no Legion to stop him,

09:23.104 --> 09:26.440
General Zod
now ruled the Galaxy.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.526
There was only one thing to do.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.111
<i>Take the last Time-Sphere</i>

09:30.194 --> 09:33.614
<i>and stop Lor-Zod</i>
<i>from stopping our future.</i>

09:40.746 --> 09:41.747
Metron.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.166
Ah, Razer.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.836
I predicted
I would see you again.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.630
The red power ring
I gave you for safekeeping.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.173
I require its return.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.675
Nothing could be simpler.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.219
The red ring
will be yours again

09:55.303 --> 09:58.389
in exchange for your blue ring.

09:59.598 --> 10:01.684
The evidence
of Darkseid's agents

10:01.767 --> 10:05.104
infiltrating and exploiting
the Earth is undeniable.

10:05.187 --> 10:07.857
What do Highfather's New Gods
intend to do about it?

10:07.940 --> 10:08.899
Nothing.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.860
-Excuse me?
-We will not,

10:10.943 --> 10:13.821
cannot help battle
Apokoliptan forces.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.282
But that's why we need you.
That's why we're here.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.993
The truce between
New Genesis and Apokolips

10:19.076 --> 10:20.786
came at a heavy cost.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.457
New Genesis will not be
the first to break that truce.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.000
You're afraid of a fight?

10:26.083 --> 10:28.919
You should all be afraid
of that fight.

10:29.003 --> 10:32.131
What is needed
is a neutral mediator.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.591
The Green Lantern Corps

10:33.674 --> 10:35.718
is uniquely qualified
for such a role.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.597
If even they have the stomach
to defy Apokolips.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.475
They released Darkseid's
Furies and Mantis

10:42.558 --> 10:44.977
only six months
after the Anti-Life event

10:45.061 --> 10:47.229
-at the Orphanage.
-They were poozers.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.608
The big bad, Granny Goodness,
got away.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.360
[scoffs]
Thanks to you Earthlings.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.862
Earthlings, including the three
Green Lanterns on the scene?

10:54.945 --> 10:57.990
Why are there so many
Green Lanterns from Earth?

10:58.074 --> 11:01.660
It's, uh, hard to find
qualified GLs.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.789
You know, somehow
the screwy conditions on Earth

11:04.872 --> 11:07.625
produce a lot of
potential candidates.

11:07.708 --> 11:11.420
But each green rings A.I.
chooses its own Lantern

11:11.504 --> 11:14.298
based on a subject's love
of justice

11:14.382 --> 11:17.551
and ability to overcome fear
with willpower.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.137
Meanwhile, Earth's
bleeding meta-humans.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.431
The League is trying
to stop the hemorrhaging,

11:22.515 --> 11:25.101
but we need the Corps
and the New Gods to do more

11:25.184 --> 11:26.852
to shut down
off-world trafficking.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.313
Your petition has been noted.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.149
-That's it?
-You have our sympathy,

11:32.233 --> 11:35.611
but we have an entire
galaxy to police.

11:35.694 --> 11:39.824
Finding your lost strays
is not our sole priority.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.367
-But--
-[cell phone vibrating]

11:42.576 --> 11:44.412
[grunts] Excuse me.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.957
<i>Using sketchy</i>
<i>historical records,</i>

11:48.040 --> 11:50.584
I pinpointed
the one time in the past

11:50.668 --> 11:53.212
prior to the event,
ten years from this era

11:53.295 --> 11:54.713
that inspired the Legion,

11:54.797 --> 11:57.925
when I knew exactly
where the Superboy would be.

11:58.008 --> 12:01.011
From our quick review of
the Galaxy's revised history,

12:01.095 --> 12:03.556
we knew just
where Lor would strike.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.767
We time-traveled
to the United Nations last year

12:06.851 --> 12:09.728
<i>when Superboy famously revealed</i>
<i>his existence to the world</i>

12:09.812 --> 12:13.274
<i>and managed to prevent</i>
<i>Lor's assassination of Kon-El.</i>

12:13.357 --> 12:16.694
And you thought that would be
enough to revert the timeline.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.488
Been there, didn't revert that.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.282
[sighs] Lor had escaped,

12:21.365 --> 12:24.452
and still had ten years
worth of opportunities.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.454
And with history
now revised again,

12:26.537 --> 12:30.374
we had no idea when, where,
or how Lor would strike.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.169
All we could do
was shadow Superboy,

12:33.252 --> 12:35.838
<i>using our powers</i>
<i>to hide in plain sight,</i>

12:35.921 --> 12:38.591
<i>waiting for</i>
<i>Lor-Zod's next move.</i>

12:38.674 --> 12:40.134
<i>When we learned of Superboy</i>

12:40.217 --> 12:42.052
<i>and Miss Martian's</i>
<i>trip to Mars,</i>

12:42.136 --> 12:43.971
<i>we followed them there.</i>

12:44.054 --> 12:47.558
[Chameleon Boy]
<i>We did our best to keep an eye</i>
<i>on Kon-El at all times.</i>

12:47.641 --> 12:50.519
[Saturn Girl]
<i>That was our plan, anyway.</i>

12:50.603 --> 12:54.940
But Lor was on Mars, too,
with a plan of his own.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.026
By keeping this Sphere
out of sync

12:57.109 --> 12:58.694
with the timestream
as I am now,

12:58.777 --> 13:01.822
I made it impossible for
the Legionnaires to track me.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.240
<i>I used my heat vision</i>

13:03.324 --> 13:05.201
<i>to destroy</i>
<i>the Earthlings' Zeta-Tube</i>

13:05.284 --> 13:08.204
<i>and the M'arzz-Earth</i>
<i>communications satellite,</i>

13:08.287 --> 13:10.372
<i>cutting Superboy off</i>
<i>from the League</i>

13:10.456 --> 13:12.041
<i>and any support</i>
<i>they might offer.</i>

13:12.124 --> 13:14.335
<i>Then I cut off support</i>
<i>from my pursuers</i>

13:14.418 --> 13:17.087
<i>by forcing Saturn Girl</i>
<i>into an unguarded moment</i>

13:17.171 --> 13:19.965
that revealed her psychic
signature to Miss Martian.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.717
The Legion's
foolish determination

13:21.800 --> 13:23.677
to minimize interference
with the timestream

13:23.761 --> 13:26.430
compelled them to maintain
their distance from my prey.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.806
Your heart
was in the right place

13:27.890 --> 13:30.351
setting that gene bomb,
Ma'alefa'ak.

13:30.434 --> 13:31.560
[Lor-Zod]<i> All that was missing</i>

13:31.644 --> 13:33.687
<i>was a lead box of Kryptonite,</i>

13:33.771 --> 13:36.899
and Kon-El was as good as dead.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.653
We lost visual contact
with Superboy,

13:40.736 --> 13:43.072
[sighs] so we split up
to find him.

13:44.031 --> 13:44.907
<i>Then,</i>

13:45.991 --> 13:47.409
<i>it happened.</i>

13:47.493 --> 13:48.577
[explosion]

13:50.329 --> 13:54.625
Superboy
and Phantom Girl died.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.586
[Ma'alefa'ak] So<i> you</i> killed
my sister's fiance.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.129
You have a problem with that?

13:59.213 --> 14:00.130
No.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.675
I simply wanted to thank you.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.428
-What's wrong?
-[Noble]<i> Nothing.</i>

14:06.512 --> 14:08.472
<i>But I just got out</i>
<i>of the school conference and--</i>

14:08.556 --> 14:09.765
Noble, I am in the middle

14:09.848 --> 14:11.767
of an intergalactic summit.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.102
I don't have time for this.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.145
<i>You don't have time</i>
<i>for our son?</i>

14:15.229 --> 14:16.230
[sighs]

14:16.313 --> 14:17.356
S-sorry.

14:17.439 --> 14:18.691
Of course, I do.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.026
-Tell me.
<i>-It's basically good news.</i>

14:21.110 --> 14:22.361
<i>The school wants to set</i>

14:22.444 --> 14:24.154
<i>Amistad up</i>
<i>with a one-on-one aide,</i>

14:24.238 --> 14:26.490
<i>you know, a shadow, to work</i>
<i>with him in the classroom.</i>

14:26.574 --> 14:28.534
<i>And the district provides</i>
<i>one free of charge.</i>

14:28.617 --> 14:31.453
And Amistad gets stigmatized?

14:31.537 --> 14:34.290
[sighs]<i> You're worried</i>
<i>about the wrong things, Raq.</i>

14:34.373 --> 14:35.624
<i>Appearances don't matter.</i>

14:35.708 --> 14:37.835
<i>We need to help our son.</i>

14:37.918 --> 14:39.253
I'll consider it.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.629
<i>That's it?</i>

14:40.713 --> 14:43.215
Look, that is all
that I can give you right now.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.218
I'm trying to bring peace
to an entire galaxy,

14:46.885 --> 14:48.012
and I'm failing.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.056
[Razer sighs]

14:51.974 --> 14:53.559
Maybe this is a mistake.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.525
[Metron] Is something wrong?

15:01.609 --> 15:03.235
When this ring first chose me,

15:03.319 --> 15:04.653
I was a different man.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.613
Now--

15:05.696 --> 15:07.823
You came to me, Razer.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.491
Have you changed your mind?

15:18.417 --> 15:19.376
When I first donned

15:19.460 --> 15:21.545
my Red Lantern ring on Volkreg,

15:21.629 --> 15:23.547
it felt like injecting acid

15:23.631 --> 15:25.841
directly in my bloodstream.

15:25.924 --> 15:29.136
Apologies in advance
for my screams of agony.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.220
Noted.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.436
[slight gasp]

15:38.896 --> 15:40.773
[Razer] Perhaps
it's lost its charge.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.358
[Metron] Fascinating.

15:42.441 --> 15:45.361
Do you know
it took less than four years

15:45.444 --> 15:48.238
for you
to completely lose hope?

15:48.322 --> 15:49.615
That's one-point-three years

15:49.698 --> 15:51.200
fewer than my initial estimate.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.369
I appreciate your faith in me.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.245
You misunderstand,

15:55.329 --> 15:57.331
this was never about faith.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.291
It was about calculation.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.292
Explain.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.710
Four years ago,

16:01.794 --> 16:04.088
I captured this Blue Ring's
potent energy signal

16:04.171 --> 16:05.923
and tracked it to you.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.257
When we met,

16:07.341 --> 16:10.344
I saw an opportunity
to study not one Ring,

16:10.427 --> 16:11.929
but two.

16:12.012 --> 16:15.099
Thus, I convinced you
to make an exchange.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.351
I did not require convincing.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.436
You agreed to keep the Red Ring

16:19.520 --> 16:21.480
so it would not
afflict anyone else.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.900
I manipulated you into reaching
that conclusion, yes.

16:24.983 --> 16:28.362
Since then, I've been occupied
with two endeavors.

16:28.445 --> 16:31.740
One, studying the Red Ring,
its properties and potential

16:31.824 --> 16:36.328
and two, providing you,
surreptitiously, with clues

16:36.412 --> 16:39.748
to aid you in your quest.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.084
False clues
that could only lead

16:42.167 --> 16:44.920
to dead ends
and the death of hope.

16:45.003 --> 16:49.091
You wasted years of my life
on fool's errands?

16:49.174 --> 16:53.137
And with hope lost,
you predictably return to me

16:53.220 --> 16:54.555
to make this trade.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.182
Now I may study
the Blue Ring at my leisure

16:57.266 --> 16:58.642
as I once studied the Red.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.185
Why tell me this now?

17:00.269 --> 17:02.396
To anger you, obviously.

17:02.479 --> 17:05.899
I've studied the Red Ring
quite thoroughly.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.944
Now, I must see it in action.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.654
You want to make me angry?

17:10.738 --> 17:12.656
You won't like me
when I'm angry.

17:13.741 --> 17:14.700
[screaming]

17:22.541 --> 17:26.545
Yes, show me
your full potential.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.796
[screaming]

17:30.299 --> 17:33.427
Time with Forager
is very pleasant to Forager.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.472
Forager has a way
of saying exactly...

17:36.555 --> 17:38.766
[both] What Forager
was thinking.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.267
-[distant explosion]
-[gasps]

17:40.350 --> 17:42.394
[Razer screams]

17:42.478 --> 17:45.522
I am quite pleased
with these readings.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.025
Every attack
generates more force

17:48.108 --> 17:49.026
than the previous.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.196
Yes, exactly.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.869
[Noble]<i> Raquel, I've known you</i>
<i>since you were Amistad's age.</i>

17:58.952 --> 18:01.830
<i>You don't fail,</i>
<i>you deal.</i>

18:04.625 --> 18:06.752
Uh, thanks, but I gotta go.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.809
Compelling data.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.693
Unexpected.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.033
[Forager] Look out!

18:38.116 --> 18:39.993
-[Rocket] What's going on here?
-Forager!

18:41.161 --> 18:42.496
[gasps] Forager!

18:46.458 --> 18:47.960
Forager?

18:48.043 --> 18:50.254
Forager! [exclaims]

18:51.046 --> 18:52.214
Forager!

18:54.758 --> 18:55.759
Forager.

18:58.136 --> 18:59.388
I've been a fool.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.059
Return the Blue Ring, New God.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.102
[screams]

19:09.231 --> 19:11.942
[Metron] This was never
about faith.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.695
Show me your full potential.

19:19.992 --> 19:20.993
What is this?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.972
I will have those rings!

19:43.891 --> 19:44.975
[Metron grunts]

19:50.689 --> 19:52.190
[Vykin] What happened?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.859
I-I'm honestly not sure.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.569
All I know is Razer
was gonna talk

19:55.652 --> 19:57.613
to some poozer named Metron.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.073
-[sighs] Metron.
-Say no more.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.246
It's okay.
He's one of the good guys.

20:06.830 --> 20:07.831
Kinda.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.751
Forager is injured.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.211
[Forager clicking]

20:25.515 --> 20:26.600
[breathing deeply]

20:28.936 --> 20:30.395
Forager.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.480
Forager.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.522
[both clicking]

20:34.733 --> 20:36.360
Forager thanks Red
and Blue Lantern

20:36.443 --> 20:38.028
for helping Forager.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.072
She would not
have required help,

20:40.155 --> 20:41.490
if not for me.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.659
Please accept my apologies

20:43.742 --> 20:47.788
and my thanks for reminding me
how to hope again.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.206
Foragers are not sure

20:49.289 --> 20:52.501
how Foragers reminded
Red and Blue Lantern.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.170
But Foragers are happy
to be of service.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.716
It seems I have more
to atone for.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.743
That is not how it was before.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.787
But it will serve.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.038
Thank you, Razer.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.624
I was prepared to give up
the Blue Ring,

21:32.708 --> 21:34.835
convinced it would find
someone more

21:35.669 --> 21:37.254
suitable than I.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.755
I dunno, Red.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.425
Looks like you're still
the Blue Ring's top choice.

21:41.508 --> 21:42.384
I believe so.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.177
It seems I am equal parts

21:44.261 --> 21:45.846
hope and rage.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.390
Anger is a part of who I am,

21:48.473 --> 21:51.476
but it is no longer
all that I am.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.813
At least, I'm hopeful
it doesn't have to be.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.357
Rage, Hope,<i> gnortz,</i>

21:57.441 --> 21:59.401
you've got a ton
of willpower too.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.028
We should get you a Green Ring.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.572
Before you know it,
you'll have Rainbow Power.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.157
-[grunts]
-[laughs]

22:05.240 --> 22:06.950
So, uh, what's next, kid?

22:07.034 --> 22:09.077
The continuation of my Quest.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.708
Say hello to Hal for me.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.510
<i>I will find you, Aya.</i>

22:26.094 --> 22:26.970
<i>I will.</i>

22:31.558 --> 22:32.768
With Kon-El dead,

22:32.851 --> 22:34.770
I had guaranteed
my parents release

22:34.853 --> 22:35.979
in the next millennium.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.314
But why wait,

22:37.397 --> 22:39.024
when I knew the last
Phantom Zone Projector

22:39.107 --> 22:40.609
was on New Genesis.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.737
Not only had we failed
to save Superboy,

22:43.820 --> 22:46.198
[sighs] but we lost
Tinya as well.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.784
To make matters worse,
Lor-Zod found

22:48.867 --> 22:50.786
and destroyed our Time-Sphere,

22:50.869 --> 22:53.121
stranding us here in the past.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.332
[sighs] Been there.
Stranded that.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.460
Fortunately, Miss Martian's
retired Bio-Ship

22:58.543 --> 23:01.296
was no longer part
of the historical record.

23:01.379 --> 23:04.132
So I opened my mind to her,
and she agreed to help.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.302
[Chameleon Boy]
We spent the next month
traveling aboard her to Earth.

23:07.385 --> 23:09.971
For months, I searched
New Genesis for the Projector,

23:10.055 --> 23:11.556
eventually learning
it was stored

23:11.640 --> 23:13.266
in Metron's
inter-dimensional vault.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.851
But even with this Time-Sphere,

23:14.935 --> 23:17.687
I'd never succeed
in retrieving it without aid.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.398
Back on Earth,
we turn to the one person

23:20.482 --> 23:23.610
capable of replacing Superboy
in our timeline.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.195
Oh. Uh, me?

23:25.278 --> 23:27.114
No, Superman!

23:27.197 --> 23:28.824
[Saturn Girl]<i> We told him</i>
<i>as little as possible,</i>

23:28.907 --> 23:33.286
<i>but at least there was a chance</i>
<i>he might take Superboy's place</i>

23:33.370 --> 23:35.789
<i>and become</i>
<i>the Legion's inspiration.</i>

23:35.872 --> 23:37.582
[Chameleon Boy]
<i>Then we came to you,</i>

23:37.666 --> 23:41.920
<i>the only true space-time expert</i>
<i>in this era, on this planet.</i>

23:42.003 --> 23:44.256
Which brings us to now,

23:44.339 --> 23:46.591
and our desperate
need for your help.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.176
[Lor-Zod] I traveled
to Apokolips

23:48.260 --> 23:49.845
and, using my assassination

23:49.928 --> 23:53.098
of Superboy as a calling card,
appealed to Darkseid himself.

23:53.181 --> 23:56.184
<i>We made a tentative deal,</i>
<i>a winner-take-all arrangement,</i>

23:56.268 --> 23:59.729
<i>which he said was similar</i>
<i>to a pact he'd made before</i>

23:59.813 --> 24:01.773
<i>with some savage or other.</i>

24:01.857 --> 24:04.359
Unfortunately, Darkseid's
truce with New Genesis

24:04.442 --> 24:06.903
prohibited any overt
intervention on his part.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.655
But he did provide resources,

24:08.738 --> 24:12.075
the two of you and this device,
the Kaizer-Thrall.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.952
Together we will find

24:14.035 --> 24:15.704
the coordinates
to Metron's vault,

24:15.787 --> 24:17.664
steal the Projector
and release my parents

24:17.747 --> 24:19.666
and the rest
from the Phantom Zone.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.836
Then, the galaxy will be ours.

24:23.378 --> 24:24.379
Well?

24:27.507 --> 24:28.466
Step inside.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.343
Ta- da!

24:30.427 --> 24:32.888
As promised, one Bio-Ship

24:32.971 --> 24:37.267
now with its very own...
Cosmic Treadmill!

24:42.689 --> 24:43.648
