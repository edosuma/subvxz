know this Diana?

14:38.703 --> 14:40.053

Absolutely incredible.

the Gem of Ursitoare.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.970

is it real?

15:28.014 --> 15:29.537
- The Ursitoare
are never wrong.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.496
What the amulet shows
must come to pass.

15:35.151 --> 15:38.067
- Why would the vampires
be after this?

15:38.111 --> 15:39.590
- They must be Il Soarta.

15:41.244 --> 15:44.160
A vampire clan that
worshipped the Ursitoare.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.596
The Ursitoare
told the Il Soarta

15:45.640 --> 15:47.772
that if they sacrificed
enough blood to them,

15:47.816 --> 15:50.862
they'd be rewarded with a stone
carved from their ribs.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.821
- What do the vampires wanna
do with the stone?

15:52.864 --> 15:55.650
- Fate has a different meaning
for the undead.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.434

for the clan,

15:57.478 --> 15:59.088

which humans to turn,

who should die next,
and who should replace them

16:01.351 --> 16:02.962

16:03.005 --> 16:05.616

- No. It shows the next fated
moment in your destiny.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.841

most times not.

And for Il Soarta,
it became a sacred practice.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.454

16:17.498 --> 16:19.674
their leader saw
he was fated to die

16:19.717 --> 16:22.024
and chose to save himself
over the clan.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.026
- Was he able
to change his fate?

16:24.070 --> 16:26.246
- He died exactly
as the gem predicted,

16:26.289 --> 16:29.597
and the amulet was lost
to Il Soarta.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.165
Once this object
reveals your fate,

16:32.208 --> 16:34.123
