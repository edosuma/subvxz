male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:03.237 --> 00:05.706
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.739 --> 00:08.176
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.209 --> 00:10.144
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.178 --> 00:11.379
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.412 --> 00:13.481
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.384
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.720
- I'M SCARED, MOMMY.
I WANT TO COME HOME.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.124
IF I GOT A CAR,
WOULD YOU PAY FOR IT?

00:23.157 --> 00:25.593
OKAY.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.701
- OH.
[imitates ninja shouting]

01:07.735 --> 01:09.437
- I WILL NEVER
UNDERSTAND WHITE PEOPLE.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.604
- CUBAN-ITALIAN.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.141
- IT STILL
DOESN'T MAKE THAT RIGHT.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.775
- NICE VIEW YOU GOT THERE,
PARTNER.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.144
- OH, DON'T YOU START.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.146
- NICE ONE.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.314
HEY, NICK, FIN,
THIS IS SAM REYNOLDS.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.315
- HOW Y'ALL DOING?

01:21.349 --> 01:22.483
- HEY, SAM.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.485
- THIS IS MY CAPTAIN
FROM ATLANTA.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.155
GOT ME TRANSFERRED
UP HERE.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.556
- DON CRAGEN AND I
GO WAY BACK.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.558
WE HATED TO LOSE THIS ONE.
- MM-HMM.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.760
- IT'S OUR GAIN.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OVER, SAM?

01:32.793 --> 01:35.463
MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD
ATTACKS ME AT DAWN.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.231
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M OUT OF HERE TOO.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.632
I JUST GOT OFF A DOUBLE SHIFT.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.135
DO NOT BET AGAINST ROLLINS.
SHE'S A SHARK.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.736
- HUSH UP. HUSH UP.
- I KNOW IT.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.139
- NIGHT.
- LATER.

01:45.173 --> 01:49.643
- SO, UH, HOW YOU DOING
UP HERE, ANYWAY?

01:49.677 --> 01:53.514
- UH, NEW YORK
WAS A FRESH START.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.748
LORD KNOWS I NEEDED IT.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.417
- YEAH, YOU HAD TO GET OUT
OF DODGE, AMANDA.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.220
DRUNK OR NOT, THE DEPUTY CHIEF
WAS OUT OF LINE.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.622
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN IT
SO PERSONALLY.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.525
NO LASTING HARM,
NO FOUL, RIGHT?

02:04.558 --> 02:05.659
- RIGHT.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.661
UH...

02:07.695 --> 02:09.763
SO YOU, UH...

02:09.797 --> 02:10.898
YOU MAKING ANY FRIENDS

02:10.931 --> 02:12.866
UP HERE IN THE BIG CITY?
- WELL, YOU JUST MET MY PARTNER.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.668
- NO, I SAID "FRIENDS."

02:14.702 --> 02:17.805
ANYBODY THAT CALLS YOU "ROLLINS"
IS ANOTHER COP, NOT A FRIEND.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.607
- OH, LORD.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.542
- HEY, YOU KNOW
I WORRY ABOUT YOU.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.345
I KNOW HOW SQUIRRELLY
YOU CAN GET.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.147
- I'M FINE, PAPA BEAR.

02:28.849 --> 02:32.586
UH, CAPTAIN...

02:32.620 --> 02:34.655
DID YOU FORGET
YOU'RE MARRIED?

02:34.688 --> 02:36.924
- [sighs]

02:36.957 --> 02:39.593
SEPARATED.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.797
I MEAN...

02:43.831 --> 02:47.268
YOU CAN'T SAY WE BOTH
HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.237
- I KNOW.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.740
BUT YOU'RE JUST CATCHING ME
BY SURPRISE RIGHT NOW.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.743
I GET THAT. OKAY.
- YEAH.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.345
- I TELL YOU WHAT--

02:57.378 --> 02:58.946
WHY DON'T I GO GET US
ANOTHER ROUND?

02:58.979 --> 03:00.681
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.
- AND--

03:00.714 --> 03:05.286
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA
TAKE THIS REAL QUICK, OKAY?

03:05.319 --> 03:09.423
[exhales deeply]

03:09.457 --> 03:13.427
[sighs]

03:13.461 --> 03:14.662
- [muffled screaming]

03:14.695 --> 03:16.864
HELP ME! HELP ME!

03:16.897 --> 03:20.634
PLEASE!

03:20.668 --> 03:22.336
- THIS IS DETECTIVE
AMANDA ROLLINS.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.805
I'VE GOT A POSSIBLE
TAXI ABDUCTION--

03:24.838 --> 03:27.808
A WHITE FEMALE, STRUGGLING
IN THE BACK OF CAB MEDALLION

03:27.841 --> 03:29.510
6-Q-0-9.

03:29.543 --> 03:33.213
THEY'RE HEADING DOWN ATTORNEY
FROM HOUSTON STREET SOUTH.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.801
- ROLLINS, STILL HERE?

04:27.835 --> 04:29.403
WHAT, ARE YOU
FISHING FOR O.T.?

04:29.437 --> 04:31.672
- NO, LAST NIGHT
I SAW A GIRL.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.408
IT'S A POSSIBLE ABDUCTION
IN A CAB ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.810
- IT COULD TIE IN WITH
THE YELLOW CAB RAPIST, THE SIKH.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.679
WE HAVE TWO OPEN CASES
FROM LAST YEAR.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.814
- OKAY, ANYTHING
MORE SOLID TO GO ONE?

04:40.848 --> 04:41.782
- THE MEDALLION NUMBER

04:41.815 --> 04:44.084
MATCHES A CAB STOLEN
IN CHELSEA YESTERDAY,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.820
BUT THE DRIVER'S REPORT SAYS
HE WAS STRUCK FROM BEHIND,

04:46.854 --> 04:48.389
SO HE NEVER SAW
THE ASSAILANT.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.857
- THE CAB TURNED UP
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO

04:49.890 --> 04:51.659
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS
FROM THE LINCOLN TUNNEL.

04:51.692 --> 04:52.793
CSU'S GOING OVER IT NOW.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.862
- AND I'VE GOT HER DESCRIPTION
INTO MISSING PERSONS,

04:54.895 --> 04:56.530
BUT NO MATCHES YET.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.998
- HEY, MIGHT'VE CAUGHT A BREAK.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.668
DESPERATE MOTHER'S BEEN CALLING
EVERY SQUAD IN THE N.Y.P.D.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.002
SAYS SHE GOT A PANICKED CALL
AT MIDNIGHT

05:02.035 --> 05:04.338
FROM HER DAUGHTER
WHO NEVER CAME HOME.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.873
DESCRIPTION MATCHES
ROLLINS'S GIRL.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.575
- ALL RIGHT, ROLLINS,
YOU SAW THE GIRL,

05:07.608 --> 05:09.743
GO TALK TO THE MOTHER.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.481
- IS THIS YOUR DAUGHTER?

05:13.514 --> 05:14.882
- THAT'S NINA
THREE YEARS AGO.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.016
SHE'S 19 NOW.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.486
SHE'S BEEN IN AND OUT
OF THE HOUSE FOR THE LAST YEAR.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.954
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO SHE
WAS WITH WHEN SHE CALLED YOU?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.590
- NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE GOES.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.024
I DON'T KNOW
WHO HER FRIENDS ARE,

05:24.057 --> 05:25.659
BUT LAST NIGHT
SHE CALLED ME,

05:25.693 --> 05:28.362
AND--AND SHE SOUNDED
LIKE A SCARED KID.

05:28.396 --> 05:31.365
SHE ASKED ME IF I HAD MONEY
TO PAY FOR A RIDE HOME.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.033
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS FEELING
OUT OF CONTROL.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.469
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE MEANT BY THAT?

05:35.503 --> 05:37.571
- I DON'T KNOW. SHE--SHE'S BEEN
GOING THROUGH A PHASE.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.739
- HOW SO?

05:38.772 --> 05:41.442
LIKE CHANGE OF HAIR,
CHANGE OF CLOTHES?

05:41.475 --> 05:43.143
- TRY PIERCINGS, TATTOOS.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.113
SHE GOT AN OCTOPUS TATTOO
ON HER LEFT ANKLE,

05:46.146 --> 05:49.917
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
SHE WAS COVERED WITH THEM.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.453
- HAS SHE HAD
ANY BOYFRIEND ISSUES LATELY?

05:52.486 --> 05:56.390
- I-I DON'T
REALLY KNOW HER ANYMORE.

05:56.424 --> 06:00.894
- MRS. RAEDO, WE'RE GOING
TO NEED SOME DNA SAMPLES.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.799
- AM I GONNA SEE HER AGAIN?

06:05.833 --> 06:08.135
- THAT'S THE GIRL
I SAW SCREAMING

06:08.168 --> 06:10.704
IN THE BACK OF THE CAB.
- ALMOST 12 HOURS AGO.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.641
SO LET'S RUN HER CELL RECORDS,
FIND OUT HER LAST CONTACTS.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.511
- JOAQUIN.

06:17.545 --> 06:20.614
- LITTLE BITCH.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.650
DETECTIVE AMARO,
NICE SUIT.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.051
- YEAH, WHY AREN'T YOU
AT SCHOOL?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.786
- THIS IS WHERE
THE MONEY IS.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.021
- DETECTIVE AMARO WILL TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT LATER.

06:28.055 --> 06:32.159
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS GIRL?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.060
- YEAH, NINA.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.895
SHE FILLED OUT SOME.
SHE GOT SOME TATS.

06:34.928 --> 06:35.896
SHE'S FINE.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.132
- TELL US WHERE
WE CAN FIND HER?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.669
SEEMS LIKE YOU WANT TO GO
TO JUVIE, HUSTLER.

06:41.702 --> 06:45.038
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT NOW,

06:45.072 --> 06:46.540
BUT SHE USED TO BE WITH PABLO.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.675
- PABLO.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.578
IS THAT HER BOYFRIEND?
WHAT, HE LIVE UP ON THE ROOF?

06:50.611 --> 06:53.814
- YEAH, HE GOT
SOME PIGEONS UP THERE.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.684
BUT TAKE IT SLOW, DETECTIVE.
PABLO'S GOLDEN GLOVES.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.985
EH, I AIN'T SCARED.

06:58.018 --> 07:01.689
[girl moaning]

07:01.722 --> 07:03.223
- THAT SOUND
LIKE PIGEONS TO YOU?

07:03.256 --> 07:06.059
- MORE LIKE A LOVE SHACK.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.661
N.Y.P.D.
NINA RAEDO?

07:07.695 --> 07:09.530
- WHAT THE HELL?
- NINA RAEDO IN HERE?

07:09.563 --> 07:12.566
- GO AWAY.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.667
- WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH ME?

07:13.701 --> 07:15.536
- WHO'S NINA?

07:15.569 --> 07:16.604
WHO'S NINA?

07:16.637 --> 07:18.138
- EASY.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.841
- KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN, HUH?
TIFFANY'S MAD JEALOUS.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.810
AND I BROKE UP WITH NINA
THREE MONTHS AGO.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.144
THE GIRL WAS JUST
TOO WILD FOR ME.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.680
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN--
PARTYING, DRUGS?

07:26.714 --> 07:28.582
- NAH, MAN,
SHE LIKED TO CAUSE TROUBLE.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.017
LIKE ONE TIME,
WE'RE AT THIS CLUB,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.485
STARTED COMING ON
TO THREE DUDES

07:31.519 --> 07:32.720
JUST TO BAIT ME
INTO A FIGHT WITH THEM.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.721
[scoffs]
GOOD TIMES.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.822
- SHE MAKE ENEMIES,

07:34.855 --> 07:36.724
PLAYING IT CLOSE
TO THE EDGE LIKE THAT?

07:36.757 --> 07:37.858
- I DON'T KNOW.
I WASHED MY HANDS.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.993
AND THEN LAST NIGHT, SHE COMES
OVER WANTING TO HOOK UP.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.863
SAID SHE WAS SCARED.
SHE ONLY FELT SAFE WITH ME.

07:42.896 --> 07:43.997
I WAS LIKE, "NAH."

07:44.031 --> 07:45.966
- SURE ABOUT
THAT LAST PART?

07:45.999 --> 07:47.801
- TIFFANY WAS
ON HER WAY OVER.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.236
- WHAT TIME
WAS THAT, PABLO?

07:49.269 --> 07:50.904
- AROUND MIDNIGHT.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.740
- ALL RIGHT, THEN YOU KNOW
HOW NINA GOT HOME.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.141
- CAR SERVICE
DOWN THE BLOCK.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.976
SHE USED IT BEFORE.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.211
NINA OKAY?

07:58.245 --> 08:01.749
- YOU WANT A CAR,
YOU GOT TO CALL.

08:01.782 --> 08:02.850
[badge taps glass]

08:02.883 --> 08:06.086
- YOU SEE THIS GIRL
LAST NIGHT?

08:06.119 --> 08:07.655
- YES, I TOLD HER
THE SAME THING.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.957
YOU WANT A CAR,
YOU GOT TO CALL OUTSIDE.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.960
- SO SHE WAS HERE.
- YEAH.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.828
TWICE I TOLD HER.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.964
SHE GAVE ME ATTITUDE.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.032
THEN SHE SAID SHE WAS GONNA LOOK
FOR ANOTHER CAR SERVICE.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.133
[chuckles]

08:20.167 --> 08:22.736
BUT THERE AREN'T
ANY OTHERS AROUND HERE.

08:22.770 --> 08:23.871
- RIGHT.
SO WHERE'D SHE GO?

08:23.904 --> 08:27.675
- I SAW A CAB PULL UP IN FRONT
JUST AS SHE CAME OUT.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.610
I GUESS SHE WENT IN.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.211
HEY, I WAS VERY BUSY.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.080
- YOU GOT CAMERAS
IN HERE.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.148
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO SEE YOUR TAPES.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.819
- THAT'S HER.
THAT'S NINA.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.658
- DISPATCHER'S TELLING NINA,
"YOU WANT A CAR, YOU CALL,

08:44.692 --> 08:46.326
BUT YOU GOT TO CALL
FROM OUTSIDE."

08:46.359 --> 08:49.329
CATCH-22. THIS GUY
MUST'VE BEEN IN THE ARMY.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.664
- WELL, THERE'S A CAB.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.601
- SWITCH
TO THE OUTSIDE CAMERA.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.106
- THAT'S
THE MEDALLION NUMBER I SAW.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.609
- SLOW IT DOWN.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.945
PUSH IN.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.346
- THIS DRIVER'S NOT OUR SIKH.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.584
HE'S A WHITE MALE.
CAN YOU ISOLATE ON HIM?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.696
- ANY HITS ON HER
CELL PHONE AFTER THIS?

09:22.730 --> 09:23.697
- NO.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.365
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE KNOW SHE WAS ABDUCTED.

09:25.398 --> 09:29.002
THE QUESTION NOW IS,
WHEN'S SHE GONNA TURN UP?

09:29.036 --> 09:31.605
- YOU SAID WE HAD TO SEE THIS
FOR OURSELVES?

09:31.639 --> 09:34.107
- JUST CAME IN AN HOUR AGO.

09:34.141 --> 09:38.846
A YOUNG WOMAN'S LEFT LEG,
FRESHLY SEVERED.

09:38.879 --> 09:42.616
- WITH AN OCTOPUS TATTOO
ON HER ANKLE.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.891
- SOME GUY FISHING OFF HIS BOAT
ON THE GOWANUS CANAL

09:50.924 --> 09:52.159
REELED IN THE LEG.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.927
THE DESCRIPTION
MATCHED NINA'S TATTOO.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.295
WE'RE RUNNING THE DNA.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.864
- PRETTY CLEAN CUT.

09:56.897 --> 10:00.067
- I'D SAY IT WAS DONE
WITH A SURGICAL SAW.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.669
AND THERE'S STILL EVIDENCE

10:01.702 --> 10:03.871
OF LIVING RESPONSE TO TRAUMA
IN THE BONY TISSUES.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.338
- YOU MEAN NINA
COULD'VE BEEN ALIVE

10:05.372 --> 10:06.940
WHEN HER LEG
WAS AMPUTATED.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.208
- THERE WAS ANESTHETIC
IN THE MARROW.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.410
WHY GO TO THAT TROUBLE
FOR A CORPSE?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.180
- SO A HEALTHY LEG,

10:13.213 --> 10:16.283
CLEANLY SEVERED
FROM A LIVING PERSON.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.886
- I MEAN, I'VE HEARD OF THAT
IN DRUG WARS,

10:18.919 --> 10:20.253
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.289
- NO.
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.091
A FISHERMAN REELED IT IN?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.759
NOBODY FISHES
IN THE GOWANUS CANAL.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.561
IT'S SO POLLUTED,
IT'S A SUPERFUND SITE.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.068
- SO YOU GOT YOUR WORKSHOP
ALL SET UP HERE

10:35.102 --> 10:37.070
RIGHT BESIDE
YOUR HOUSEBOAT.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.673
GUESS THAT MAKES YOU
PRETTY SELF-CONTAINED, HUH?

10:39.707 --> 10:41.775
- I-I'M THE RIVER KEEPER.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.911
E-EVERYTHING I NEED
IS DOWN HERE--

10:43.944 --> 10:48.448
THE SCRAPS FOR MY INVENTIONS,
THE FISH I EAT FOR DINNER.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.684
- WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU
MAKES YOU STRONGER, HUH?

10:50.718 --> 10:52.385
- SO YOU'RE TELLING US
YOU FOUND THE LEG

10:52.419 --> 10:54.054
WHEN YOU WERE FISHING?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.856
- YOU'D BE SURPRISED
WHAT COMES FLOATING BY.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.358
I FOUND A TIGER CAGE ONCE...

10:58.391 --> 10:59.192
NO TIGER, THOUGH.

10:59.226 --> 11:03.731
- WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH THIS BAND SAW?

11:03.764 --> 11:07.868
- I DIDN'T USE IT
TO CUT ANYBODY'S LEG OFF.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.203
SEE? SEE?

11:10.237 --> 11:12.740
THIS IS WHY
I DON'T TRUST THE COPS.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.374
- RIGHT NOW
WE'D REALLY APPRECIATE

11:14.407 --> 11:15.943
A LITTLE COOPERATION, OKAY?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.245
- OR WE COULD JUST TEAR UP
YOUR WORKSHOP

11:18.278 --> 11:19.813
LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.282
- LOOK AROUND IF YOU HAVE TO.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.252
BRING ON THE LUMINOL
AND THE U.V. LIGHTS.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.188
YOU WON'T FIND BLOOD.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.924
I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING...

11:30.958 --> 11:33.727
SAME AS I DID 11 YEARS AGO.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.495
- WHAT HAPPENED
11 YEARS AGO?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.231
- I FOUND THAT OTHER LEG.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.402
ISN'T THAT WHY
YOU GUYS ARE HERE?

11:42.435 --> 11:44.805
- DID YOU NOTIFY THE POLICE?
- YEAH.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.841
WASN'T MUCH
FOLLOW-THROUGH, THOUGH.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.310
THEY GOT KIND OF BUSY.

11:50.343 --> 11:55.115
IT WAS THREE DAYS BEFORE
THE PLANES HIT THE TOWERS.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.018
- THIS GOWANUS GUY
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.387
HE FISHED IT OUT OF THE CANAL
11 YEARS AGO.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.190
FEMALE, AMPUTATED TWO INCHES
ABOVE THE KNEE.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.292
AND IT GOT SET ASIDE
AND LEFT IN A FRIDGE

12:05.325 --> 12:07.995
AT THE CITY FORENSIC
ANTHROPOLOGY DEPARTMENT.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.997
- FIN AND ROLLINS FOUND SAWS
AT HIS WORKSHOP.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.165
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT--
- NO. I ALREADY CHECKED.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.902
BOTH OF THESE WOMEN LOST THEIR
LEFT LEGS TO SURGICAL SAWS.

12:14.935 --> 12:18.171
IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND
OF SCORING ON THE BONE.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.874
- WAIT. SO BOTH WERE
TOTALLY HEALTHY LIMBS,

12:20.908 --> 12:22.810
REMOVED PROFESSIONALLY?
- YES.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.178
AND THE MARROW
IN BOTH BONES HAD TRACES

12:25.212 --> 12:27.815
OF THE SAME ANESTHETIC--
PROPOFOL.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.884
- WHAT ABOUT THE REACTION
IN THE BONY TISSUE?

12:30.918 --> 12:33.921
WAS THIS VICTIM ALIVE
WHEN HER LEG WAS CUT OFF?

12:33.954 --> 12:37.057
- I CAN'T BE SURE,
BUT I THINK SO.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.158
GOOD LUCK.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.428
[cell phone chimes]
- YEAH.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.064
LIV,
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.532
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.501
- WELL,
IT JUST GOT WEIRDER.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.471
CRIME LAB GOT A DNA HIT.
- ON NINA?

12:51.504 --> 12:54.174
- NO, ON THIS LEG.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.575
AND THE WOMAN
IT BELONGS TO...

12:55.608 --> 12:57.945
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.583
LISA EVERLY.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.717
- YEAH?

13:04.751 --> 13:07.220
- CAN WE TALK TO YOU A MINUTE?
- I'M NOT SOLICITING.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.989
- WE KNOW THAT.
THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.290
WE'RE JUST--

13:10.323 --> 13:12.459
WE WANTED TO ASK YOU
ABOUT YOUR LEG.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.996
- WHAT'S IT TO YOU?
YOUR BOYFRIEND INTO THAT?

13:16.029 --> 13:19.266
- CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.401
- IT GOT CUT OFF.
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.037
I'M NOT LOOKING BACK, SO...
- BUT WHOEVER DID THIS,

13:24.071 --> 13:25.472
HE NEEDS TO PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.074
- HE ALREADY PAID.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.876
- EXCUSE ME?

13:28.909 --> 13:31.578
- FOR 25 GRAND, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO ME TOO.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.981
- WAIT.
YOU TOOK MONEY

13:34.014 --> 13:36.449
IN EXCHANGE FOR LETTING SOMEONE
CUT OFF YOUR LEG?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.151
- I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND

13:38.185 --> 13:41.521
IF YOU NEVER BEEN
THAT FAR DOWN.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.557
I WAS ALREADY
DESTROYING MYSELF ANYWAY.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.861
I WAS GONNA GET CLEAN,
GO UPSTATE...

13:47.895 --> 13:50.864
BUT ALL THE MONEY
WENT STRAIGHT INTO MY VEINS.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.533
- WE JUST REALLY NEED TO KNOW
WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.003
- JUST ANOTHER JOHN.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.504
I WAS SO MESSED UP
BACK THEN,

13:57.537 --> 13:59.372
I WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM
IF I SAW HIM AGAIN.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.174
- BUT DO YOU REMEMBER
WHERE IT HAPPENED?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.510
- EH...

14:03.543 --> 14:05.946
HE HAD A ROOM AT THE...

14:05.979 --> 14:07.414
PALACE ON BOWERY.

14:07.447 --> 14:11.118
- WERE YOU UNDER ANESTHETIC?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.020
- YEAH, IT WAS GOOD STUFF...

14:13.053 --> 14:14.154
BUT WEIRD.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.424
I WAS PRETTY
OUT OF IT AFTERWARDS.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.159
I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE,

14:19.192 --> 14:22.262
AND I'M NOT GOOD
WITH DETAILS NOW.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.200
- THE PALACE HOTEL
USED TO BE A FLOPHOUSE.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.235
NOW, DOWN THE BLOCK,

14:28.268 --> 14:30.337
THEY'RE GETTING TWO GRAND
A NIGHT FOR A SUITE.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.672
- I'M STILL TRYING TO--

14:32.705 --> 14:34.507
ARE WE REALLY LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY

14:34.541 --> 14:38.578
WHO PAYS FOR THE PLEASURE
OF AMPUTATING WOMEN'S LIMBS?

14:38.611 --> 14:41.248
- NINA WASN'T PAID, CAPTAIN.
SHE WAS ABDUCTED.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.016
- OKAY,
SO HE'S ESCALATING?

14:43.050 --> 14:47.020
- OR MAYBE HE'S JUST BURNED
THROUGH ALL THE WILLING VICTIMS,

14:47.054 --> 14:48.455
AND NOW HE'S MOVED ON
TO THE UNWILLING ONES?

14:48.488 --> 14:50.590
- WELL, I KNOW
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS,

14:50.623 --> 14:52.993
BUT IF LISA SURVIVED,
MAYBE NINA'S ALIVE TOO.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.995
- MAYBE NOT.

14:55.028 --> 14:59.266
BODY JUST TURNED UP
NEAR THE GOWANUS CANAL.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.938
IS IT HER?

15:10.343 --> 15:12.946
- [sighs]

15:12.980 --> 15:14.948
THAT POOR GIRL.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.650
HOPE SHE WAS STILL UNDER
WHEN SHE WENT.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.261
- CAUSE OF DEATH--HEART FAILURE
FROM A DRUG REACTION.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.396
SHE WAS FULL OF PROPOFOL.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.599
- ANY SIGN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT?
- NOT THAT I CAN SEE.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.668
ALL THE DAMAGE TO HER BODY
WAS DONE SURGICALLY.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.504
- SO HE PUTS HER
UNDER GENERAL ANESTHETIC

15:37.537 --> 15:38.471
TO CUT OFF HER LEG,

15:38.505 --> 15:41.508
AND HE ACCIDENTALLY
ADMINISTERS TOO MUCH?

15:41.541 --> 15:42.976
- OR MAYBE
HE WAS DONE WITH HER,

15:43.010 --> 15:45.612
AND HE DELIBERATELY
LEFT HER TO DIE.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.181
- THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I NEED TO SHOW YOU.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.083
SHE HAD EAR-POINTING SURGERY.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.318
- WHAT?

15:51.351 --> 15:53.353
- A SMALL WEDGE OF CARTILAGE
IS REMOVED

15:53.386 --> 15:55.355
FROM THE EAR,
THEN SEWN INTO A POINT.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.490
- UH--

15:57.524 --> 16:00.527
WELL, IT--I MEAN,
THESE CUTS ARE FULLY HEALED.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.295
IT'S NOT FROM
THE SAME ATTACK.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.696
- I WAS GETTING TO THAT.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.298
SHE HAD THIS DONE
A WHILE AGO.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.267
- AND THE TATTOOS
AND THE PIERCINGS

16:07.300 --> 16:08.535
ARE EVEN OLDER, RIGHT?

16:08.568 --> 16:12.305
- HER BODY--IT'S A RECORD OF HER
JOURNEY INTO BODY MODIFICATION.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.507
- HOW DOES THAT

16:14.541 --> 16:17.677
TRACK WITH HER LEG
BEING FORCIBLY AMPUTATED?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.079
- WELL, THAT'S YOUR JOB.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.381
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU
ABOUT THE SUBCULTURE

16:21.414 --> 16:22.782
IS IT PUSHES THE EDGE.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.317
TATTOOS
USED TO BE SUBVERSIVE.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.153
NOW KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS
HAVE THEM,

16:26.186 --> 16:28.121
WHICH MEANS THE FRINGE
HAS TO GO EVEN FURTHER.

16:28.155 --> 16:31.424
I'VE SEEN STRETCHED EARLOBES,
FORKED TONGUES,

16:31.458 --> 16:34.394
STEEL PLATES
IMPLANTED UNDER THE SKIN.

16:34.427 --> 16:38.598
AMPUTATION
IS THE NEXT FRONTIER.

16:38.631 --> 16:42.635
- SO MAYBE FOR NINA,
THE TATTOO AND THE PIERCINGS

16:42.669 --> 16:47.074
WAS LIKE A GATEWAY DRUG,
AND WHOEVER DID THIS TO HER...

16:47.107 --> 16:49.109
WAS MAYBE SOMEBODY
THAT SHE MET FROM THIS WORLD.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.278
- SO WE JUST FOLLOW HER PATH.
I MEAN, LOOK--

16:51.311 --> 16:53.513
THIS TATTOO RIGHT HERE
IS DISTINCTIVE.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.482
LOOKS LIKE IT EVEN HAS
AN EMBEDDED SIGNATURE.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.450
THE ARTIST SHOULDN'T BE
TOO TOUGH TO TRACK.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.486
[camera shutter clicks]

17:01.488 --> 17:03.656
KENJI YASHIMI?
- NOT NOW.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.826
[needle buzzing]

17:06.859 --> 17:10.763
- THIS YOUR WORK?
[buzzing stops]

17:12.665 --> 17:15.702
- YEAH, A PERSONAL FAVORITE
FROM TWO YEARS AGO--

17:15.735 --> 17:17.570
ONE OF A KIND.
[needle buzzing]

17:17.604 --> 17:19.339
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.541
THE GIRL WHO HAD IT IS DEAD.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.611
[buzzing stops]

17:24.644 --> 17:27.214
- CAN YOU SIT TIGHT?

17:30.350 --> 17:33.586
NINA'S DEAD?
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.388
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

17:35.422 --> 17:36.456
- ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.192
- THAT'S AROUND THE TIME
NINA GOT HER EARS POINTED.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.761
THAT YOUR WORK TOO?
- NO.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.863
I MEAN, NINA CAME IN ASKING
ABOUT HAVING THAT WORK DONE,

17:43.896 --> 17:46.233
BUT LIKE I TOLD HER,
WE HAVE A CELEBRITY CLIENTELE.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.467
I DON'T DO JOB STOPPERS.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.768
- "JOB STOPPERS"?

17:48.801 --> 17:52.105
- FACE TATTOOS,
ELF EARS,

17:52.139 --> 17:53.740
IDIOTIC FADS FOR PEOPLE
TOO YOUNG TO REALIZE

17:53.773 --> 17:56.843
THEY'LL NEVER HAVE A CAREER
AFTER THAT.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.645
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT--

17:58.678 --> 18:00.547
THAT WHITE TAT.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.782
CLASSY.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.452
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO SHE MIGHT'VE GONE TO?

18:05.485 --> 18:07.454
- YEAH, GO BOTHER
SETH MORETZ.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.556
I HEARD HIM TALKING TO NINA
ABOUT ELF EARS.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.392
CHICK WAS OBSESSED.
- SETH WORKS HERE?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.826
- NOT ANYMORE.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.895
I FIRED HIM AFTER I CAUGHT HIM
TRYING TO STEER MY CLIENTS

18:15.928 --> 18:19.166
TOWARDS HIS
BODY-MOD BUSINESS.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.668
- HEY, SETH.
- COME ON.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.136
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.371
I NEED TO DROP
THIS BIKE OFF.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.706
- NO, ACTUALLY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO HOLD UP HERE A MINUTE.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.375
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT NINA RAEDO.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.509
- NINA WHO?

18:29.542 --> 18:31.644
- THE GIRL YOU TALKED TO
ABOUT GETTING THE SPOCK EARS.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.880
- NOT SPOCK, GRANDPA--ARWEN...

18:33.913 --> 18:36.616
YOU KNOW, LIV TYLER...

18:36.649 --> 18:38.385
LORD OF THE RINGS.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.421
- SO YOU DID TALK TO NINA
ABOUT OPERATING ON HER EARS.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.290
- [chuckles]
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ME ON THAT.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.757
I DON'T MESS
WITH PEOPLES' EARS...

18:44.791 --> 18:46.259
EXCEPT WITH MY MUSIC.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.295
- OH, YEAH?

18:48.328 --> 18:49.662
WHAT DO YOU USE THIS FOR?

18:49.696 --> 18:51.931
- JUST TO FILL UP
MY BIKE TIRES.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.501
- REALLY? YOU NEED A FACE MASK
TO--TO FILL UP YOUR BIKE TIRES?

18:54.534 --> 18:56.269
WE GOT A TANK
OF NITROUS OXIDE--

18:56.303 --> 18:58.871
SERIAL NUMBERS ON IT
AND EVERYTHING.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.608
- GUESS WHAT.
YOU'RE GOING FOR A RIDE.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.477
AND YOU WON'T NEED
YOUR BICYCLE.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.381
[knock at door]

19:08.415 --> 19:09.816
- HI.
CAN I HELP YOU?

19:09.849 --> 19:12.419
- YEAH, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR DR. GENE BRIGHTMAN.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.953
- HE IS IN WITH A PATIENT
RIGHT NOW.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.722
- YEAH.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.628
- UH, DOCTOR,
I NEED YOU UP FRONT.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.832
- JESS,
I'M ABOUT TO START A CROWN.

19:25.865 --> 19:26.833
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

19:26.866 --> 19:28.701
- YEAH, WE HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.570
IS THERE A MORE PRIVATE PLACE
TO SPEAK?

19:30.603 --> 19:33.206
- JESS,
KEEP MRS. LEARY CALM.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.475
DON'T ASK HER
ABOUT HER KIDS.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.844
THIS WAY.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.879
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

19:39.912 --> 19:42.349
- IT'S A POLICE INVESTIGATION.

19:42.382 --> 19:46.419
NINA RAEDO--
SHE A PATIENT OF YOURS?

19:46.453 --> 19:48.655
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
WHY?

19:48.688 --> 19:51.491
- YOU MISSING
ANY NITROUS OXIDE TANKS?

19:51.524 --> 19:52.725
- NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.495
- WELL, WE FOUND ONE
WHERE IT SHOULDN'T BE

19:55.528 --> 19:58.731
AND TRACED IT BACK
TO YOUR OFFICE.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.932
YOU KNOW A SETH MORETZ?

19:59.966 --> 20:03.303
- [laughs] FOR GOD'S SAKE.
THAT IMBECILE.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.672
- HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.640
- HE USED TO DATE JESS,
THE RECEPTIONIST.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.676
I THOUGHT
SHE'D GOTTEN RID OF HIM.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.311
- SO IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT HE STOLE

20:11.344 --> 20:12.745
A NITROUS TANK
FROM YOUR OFFICE.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.748
- THIS KID--
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.350
I'LL HAVE JESS DO AN INVENTORY.

20:17.384 --> 20:21.254
- BETTER DO IT YOURSELF.
SHE'S GONE.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.392
- JESS HARDWICK IS NOT ANSWERING
HER CELL PHONE.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.893
WE PUT HER APARTMENT
UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.027
- WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW
ABOUT HER?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.430
- NO PRIORS, SHE WORKED
FOR THE DENTIST FOR FIVE YEARS.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.032
DR. BRIGHTMAN SWEARS BY HER.
HE BLAMES HER BOYFRIEND.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.667
- UH-HUH.
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.437
LET'S SEE WHO
THE BOYFRIEND BLAMES.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.940
- [sighs]

20:40.973 --> 20:42.909
BAD NEWS, SETH--

20:42.942 --> 20:45.578
TALKED TO DR. BRIGHTMAN.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.047
HE'S PRESSING CHARGES
FOR A STOLEN NITROUS TANK.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.817
- WHAT DO YOU CARE ABOUT THAT,
SERIOUSLY?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.719
I DIDN'T KNOW DENTISTS
QUALIFIED AS SPECIAL VICTIMS.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.555
- WELL, THEY DON'T,
BUT NINA DOES.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.390
- [chuckles]
NINA?

21:02.762 --> 21:05.532
I-I--WHAT IS THAT?
I DON'T--

21:05.565 --> 21:07.667
I-I-I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.702
YOU TELLING ME
YOU DON'T KNOW HER?

21:09.736 --> 21:11.938
LOOK HARD.
AND DON'T LIE.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.706
- SHE MIGHT'VE COME
INTO THE OLD SHOP.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.075
- YOU MEAN KENJI YASHIMI'S
TATTOO PARLOR.

21:16.108 --> 21:20.547
HE TOLD US THAT HE FIRED YOU
FOR DOING ELF EARS.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.814
DID YOU DO HERS?

21:21.848 --> 21:23.883
- NO, THAT--THAT'S WRONG.
I SWEAR.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.585
I-I-I'M NOT GOOD
WITH SNIPPING AND SEWING.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.821
- OH, OKAY, NOW I GET IT.
HE'S JUST THE STEERER.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.991
IT'S HIS GIRLFRIEND, JESS,
WHO DOES THE OPERATIONS, RIGHT?

21:32.024 --> 21:33.092
SO WHERE IS SHE?

21:33.125 --> 21:36.095
- I DON'T KNOW.
- HEY, WAKE UP, SETH!

21:36.128 --> 21:38.731
WE ALREADY GOT YOU FOR
POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY,

21:38.765 --> 21:40.467
AND YOU'RE THIS CLOSE
TO HOMICIDE.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.736
- I DIDN'T TOUCH NINA--
I SWEAR.

21:43.770 --> 21:46.439
IT WAS JESS. SHE DID HER EARS.
SHE'S GOT THE SKILLS.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.807
- SETH, WHERE IS SHE?

21:47.840 --> 21:49.376
- TRY CONEY ISLAND--

21:49.409 --> 21:51.811
FREAK NIGHT
AT THE MERMAID HOTEL TONIGHT.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.980
SHE'LL BE THERE, WORKING.

21:54.013 --> 21:57.116
YOU NEED A PASSWORD
TO GET IN.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.587
- YOU GOT A TATTOO.
I NEVER NOTICED.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.623
- YEAH, MY LITTLE REWARD FOR
GETTING THROUGH MARCH MADNESS

22:03.656 --> 22:05.024
WITHOUT PUTTING DOWN A BET.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.126
- GOOD FOR YOU.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.961
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.030
IT'S A LITTLE TAME
FOR FREAK NIGHT.

22:11.063 --> 22:12.632
- YEAH.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.634
READY TO PARTY?

22:17.970 --> 22:20.540
- WHO ARE YOU?

22:20.573 --> 22:22.942
- I HARDLY KNOW, SIR,
JUST AT PRESENT.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.445
- ENJOY YOUR EVENING.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.386
- DAMN.

22:44.063 --> 22:47.033
[slow rock music playing]

22:47.066 --> 22:54.474
*

23:17.864 --> 23:22.802
- OH, MY GOD.
YOUR EARS ARE GORGEOUS.

23:22.835 --> 23:26.105
DO YOU MIND IF I STARE?
- NOT AT ALL. GO AHEAD.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.775
- SHE'S BEEN THINKING
ABOUT GETTING HERS DONE.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.677
- YEAH.
DID IT HURT?

23:30.710 --> 23:32.912
- NOT IF YOU KNOW
WHO TO GO TO.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.614
- YOURS ARE THE BEST
I'VE EVER SEEN.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.082
DO YOU MIND?
WHO DID THEM?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.784
- GO SEE JESS.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.452
SHE'S WORKING TONIGHT--

23:39.486 --> 23:41.888
CASH ONLY,
LIKE, 600 BUCKS.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.923
- BABY?
- ANYTHING YOU WANT, BOO.

23:43.956 --> 23:44.991
YOU KNOW I GOT YOU.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.059
- SHE'S IN THE TRUCK
OUT BACK.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.195
- GREAT. AND MY MAN CAN COME,
RIGHT? HE LIKES TO WATCH.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.798
- JESS IS COOL WITH THAT.

23:51.831 --> 23:56.002
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

23:56.035 --> 23:57.904
- OPEN IT UP.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.640
N.Y.P.D., STOP!

24:00.673 --> 24:02.742
- DROP THE BLADE.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.578
- OKAY.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.648
YOU DON'T NEED THE GUNS.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.917
COMING OUT.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.097
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.667
YOU SEE YOURSELF
AS HELPING PEOPLE

24:27.700 --> 24:29.569
BE THE ARCHITECTS
OF THEIR OWN BODY.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.037
- EXACTLY.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.272
- I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT GYMS ARE FOR,

24:33.305 --> 24:35.875
NOT BLADES AND SYRINGES.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.877
- PLASTIC SURGEONS CHANGE
PEOPLE'S APPEARANCE EVERY DAY--

24:37.910 --> 24:42.181
FACE-LIFTS, NOSE JOBS,
BREAST IMPLANTS.

24:42.214 --> 24:45.117
- EXCEPT THEY HAVE
MEDICAL LICENSES, AND YOU DON'T.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.655
AND THEY BUY THEIR EQUIPMENT,
NOT STEAL IT LIKE YOU DO.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.023
- JESS, WE KNOW
ABOUT YOUR SIDE BUSINESS.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.025
WE KNOW YOU ALTERED
NINA RAEDO'S EARS.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.528
- YEAH,
AND THAT WAS HER CHOICE.

24:55.562 --> 24:58.297
- AND WHAT ABOUT AMPUTATING
HER LEG?

24:58.330 --> 25:02.034
WAS THAT HER DECISION TOO?

25:02.068 --> 25:03.235
- UH...

25:03.269 --> 25:05.538
I'M SORRY.
WHAT?

25:05.572 --> 25:07.206
- YOU INJECTED HER
WITH PROPOFOL,

25:07.239 --> 25:08.307
CUT OFF HER LEG,

25:08.340 --> 25:12.078
EXCEPT SOMETHING WENT WRONG,
AND NINA ENDED UP DEAD.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.646
- NINA'S DEAD.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.549
- YEAH.
TELL US HOW IT HAPPENED.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.085
YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO GIVE HER TOO
MUCH, MUST'VE BEEN A MISTAKE.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.654
- I'M--I'M SORRY.
THIS IS WR--

25:21.688 --> 25:25.558
THIS IS ALL WRONG.
I...

25:25.592 --> 25:29.095
I WOULD NEVER USE ANYTHING
STRONGER THAN LIDOCAINE.

25:29.128 --> 25:32.064
I WOULD NEVER GET INVOLVED
IN AN OPERATION LIKE THAT.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.000
- NO?

25:34.033 --> 25:37.837
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR LEG, THEN?

25:37.870 --> 25:40.807
- THIS?

25:43.610 --> 25:47.113
I LOST IT TO BONE CANCER
WHEN I WAS 15.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.086
TOOK A LOT OF WORK...

25:54.120 --> 25:56.856
BUT NOW I'M PROUD...

25:56.889 --> 26:00.860
'CAUSE I'M EXTRAORDINARY.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.863
I HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE

26:03.896 --> 26:06.733
THEIR OWN PERCEPTION
OF BEAUTY.

26:06.766 --> 26:10.002
IT'S A VISION
OF THEIR TRUE SELVES.

26:10.036 --> 26:14.140
BUT I WOULD NEVER, EVER
SUBJECT SOMEONE

26:14.173 --> 26:16.909
TO WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH.

26:22.314 --> 26:25.184
- WELL, THAT WAS
A PRETTY MOVING STORY.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.086
ANYBODY ELSE HAVING A PROBLEM
CHOKING IT DOWN?

26:27.119 --> 26:29.188
- WELL, SHE'S SAYING
THAT SHE HELPS EMPOWER PEOPLE

26:29.221 --> 26:30.623
THROUGH BODY MODIFICATION

26:30.657 --> 26:32.892
AND DRAWS A CLEAR LINE
AT AMPUTATION.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.894
- AND I BELIEVE HER.
- I DON'T.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.263
SHE AND HER BOYFRIEND
BEEN ROBBING DENTISTS BLIND--

26:37.296 --> 26:39.165
NITROUS, SURGICAL TOOLS.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.867
WE NEED TO AT LEAST
CHECK AND SEE

26:40.900 --> 26:42.669
IF SHE'S BEEN STEALING
ANESTHETIC TOO.

26:42.702 --> 26:43.602
- I AGREE.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.272
THIS DENTIST SHE WORKS FOR,
BRIGHTMAN--

26:46.305 --> 26:47.774
WHAT KIND OF PRACTICE
DOES HE HAVE?

26:47.807 --> 26:49.642
- HIS BROCHURE
SAYS IT'S COSMETIC.

26:49.676 --> 26:52.144
- OKAY, GOOD. THEN HE SHOULDN'T
BE ORDERING PROPOFOL.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.313
CHECK WITH THE CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCE DATABASE,

26:54.346 --> 26:58.384
SEE WHAT'S ON HIS SCRIP PADS
AND WHO'S SIGNING THEM.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.652
- SO GENE BRIGHTMAN--

26:59.686 --> 27:03.355
HE'S WRITTEN PRESCRIPTIONS FOR
OXYCONTIN, PERCOCET, VICODIN...

27:03.389 --> 27:05.157
HEAVY-DUTY PAINKILLERS,

27:05.191 --> 27:07.927
BUT NO SURGICAL ANESTHETICS
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.796
- SO JESS WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.
- MAYBE.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.363
BUT SOMETHING STRANGE
DID POP UP.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.866
I FOUND SEVERAL PRESCRIPTIONS
FOR PROPOFOL

27:13.900 --> 27:15.935
UNDER THE NAME
"DR. HAL BRIGHTMAN."

27:15.968 --> 27:17.336
OKAY, ONE SIX MONTHS AGO,

27:17.369 --> 27:20.707
ONE FROM TWO WEEKS
BEFORE NINA DISAPPEARED.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.374
- WAS IT A MISTAKE
IN THE DATA ENTRY?

27:22.408 --> 27:23.242
- IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.878
DIFFERENT DOCTOR,
DIFFERENT ADDRESS.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.680
- ORDERING
HEAVY-DUTY ANESTHETIC?

27:27.714 --> 27:28.948
WHAT KIND OF SURGERY
DOES HE DO?

27:28.981 --> 27:31.150
- WELL, THAT'S JUST IT.
HE DOESN'T.

27:31.183 --> 27:32.752
HE'S A PSYCHIATRIST.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.158
- NINA RAEDO...

27:39.191 --> 27:42.829
NO.
I DON'T KNOW THAT NAME.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.230
CAN I ASK
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

27:44.263 --> 27:46.465
- IS THIS
YOUR PRESCRIPTION?

27:46.498 --> 27:48.935
- PROPOFOL?

27:48.968 --> 27:51.070
THERE'S NO WAY
THIS CAME FROM MY OFFICE.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.338
I HAVE NO USE
FOR ANESTHETIC.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.006
- BUT IS THAT
YOUR PRESCRIPTION PAD?

27:54.040 --> 27:58.110
- YES, BUT IT'S NOT
MY SIGNATURE.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.346
GO THROUGH
MY ORDER HISTORY.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.248
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
TO PRESCRIBE PROZAC.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.350
I STILL BELIEVE
IN THE TALKING CURE.

28:04.383 --> 28:08.921
- SO DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE
ACCESS TO YOUR PRESCRIPTION PAD?

28:08.955 --> 28:13.259
- I GUESS ANYONE WHO WORKS IN
A PHARMACY THAT MY PATIENTS USE

28:13.292 --> 28:17.730
AND ANY OF THE ASSISTANTS
I'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.799
WHEN DID THIS START?

28:19.832 --> 28:22.735
- WE'RE LOOKING AT OVER
FIVE YEARS--SPORADIC ORDERS.

28:22.769 --> 28:25.137
- MY GOD.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.840
THERE'S ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY.

28:27.874 --> 28:30.176
THAT DRUG CAN BE USED
RECREATIONALLY.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.411
SOME OF MY PATIENTS
HAVE SUBSTANCE-ABUSE PROBLEMS.

28:32.444 --> 28:35.882
- OKAY, WELL,
WE'LL NEED THEIR NAMES.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.750
- I WANT TO FIND
WHOEVER THIS IS,

28:37.784 --> 28:40.219
BUT I CAN'T VIOLATE
CONFIDENTIALITY--

28:40.252 --> 28:41.821
YOU KNOW THAT--

28:41.854 --> 28:43.890
EVEN IF I'M THE VICTIM
OF A CRIME.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.825
- OKAY.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.927
DO YOU KNOW
A JESS HARDWICK?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.396
- YES, I DO, ACTUALLY.
SHE WORKS FOR MY BROTHER.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.865
- RIGHT, DR. GENE BRIGHTMAN,
THE DENTIST.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.934
- YES. WHY?
- OKAY.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.402
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY WAY

28:56.435 --> 28:58.537
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ACCESS
TO YOUR PRESCRIPTION PAD?

28:58.570 --> 29:03.042
- [sighs]
I'M TRYING TO THINK.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.544
I DON'T REMEMBER HER EVER
COMING TO OUR COUNTRY HOUSE.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.780
- YOUR COUNTRY HOUSE?

29:07.814 --> 29:10.216
- MY BROTHER AND I
SHARE OUR MOTHER'S OLD HOUSE.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.484
WE'VE BEEN FIXING IT UP.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.386
- AND YOU BRING YOUR SCRIP PAD
WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO THERE.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.222
- FOR EMERGENCIES.

29:16.255 --> 29:20.126
- WELL, IS IT POSSIBLE YOUR
BROTHER USED YOUR SCRIP PAD?

29:20.159 --> 29:22.294
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

29:22.328 --> 29:24.931
HE HAS HIS OWN.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.065
EXCUSE ME.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.268
I HAVE A PHONE SESSION
WITH A PATIENT.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.502
- WELL,
HE SHUT US DOWN FAST.

29:30.536 --> 29:34.140
- RIGHT WHEN WE STARTED ASKING
ABOUT HIS BROTHER, DR. GENE.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.175
THAT'S A WEIRD COINCIDENCE.

29:36.208 --> 29:39.979
NINA SEES JESS FOR HER EARS,
AND JESS WORKS FOR DR. GENE.

29:40.012 --> 29:43.315
- AND DR. GENE'S BROTHER HAS
PROPOFOL ORDERED UNDER HIS NAME

29:43.349 --> 29:44.350
THAT HE'S NOT AWARE OF?

29:44.383 --> 29:46.585
- DR. GENE--I MEAN,
HE'S SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW

29:46.618 --> 29:48.320
WRITING HIS OWN SCRIP
FOR PROPOFOL

29:48.354 --> 29:50.289
COULD'VE TRIPPED AN ALARM
IN THE SYSTEM.

29:50.322 --> 29:54.193
- AND DENTISTS
HAVE SOME MEDICAL TRAINING.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.594
MAYBE JESS ISN'T THE ONLY ONE

29:55.627 --> 29:58.597
DOING BODY MOD
IN DR. GENE'S OFFICE.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.967
- I TOLD YOU
I DON'T KNOW NINA RAEDO.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.836
- WELL, CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE YOU WERE SATURDAY NIGHT?

30:03.870 --> 30:05.571
- AT THE FAMILY COUNTRY HOUSE
IN SAG HARBOR.

30:05.604 --> 30:09.341
- ALONE?

30:09.375 --> 30:11.443
- DON'T TELL MY BROTHER,
BUT I-I HAD A DATE.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.479
- WELL, WE'LL NEED HER NAME.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.448
- HIS NAME--PAUL.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.551
NO ONE
IN MY FAMILY KNOWS, OKAY?

30:19.585 --> 30:21.854
- WELL, WE'LL NEED
PAUL'S NUMBER.

30:21.888 --> 30:24.356
- OKAY, BUT THIS CANNOT BE
A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.893
OUTING MY CLIENT COULD SERIOUSLY
DAMAGE HIS PRACTICE.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.527
- [chuckles]

30:28.560 --> 30:30.396
NOT AS MUCH
AS A MURDER CHARGE.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.998
- THESE ACCUSATIONS
ARE HORRIFYING.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.632
I WOULD--I WOULD NEVER BE
INVOLVED WITH THIS.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.601
LOOK...

30:38.670 --> 30:41.007
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY,

30:41.040 --> 30:44.343
MY MOTHER LOST HER LEG
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

30:49.916 --> 30:52.018
- OKAY, GENE.

30:52.051 --> 30:55.287
BUT YOU DO
HAVE A WOMAN WORKING FOR YOU

30:55.321 --> 30:59.191
IN YOUR PRACTICE WHO PERFORMS
BODY MODIFICATIONS.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.327
SHE USES
YOUR SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS,

31:01.360 --> 31:02.461
YOUR PAINKILLERS--

31:02.494 --> 31:04.363
- I TOLD YOU
I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THAT,

31:04.396 --> 31:06.198
NO IDEA WHAT SHE DOES
OUTSIDE OF WORK.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.266
AND--AND I FIRED HER.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.401
- AFTER WE ARRESTED HER.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.503
AND THESE
MEDICAL-SUPPLY ORDERS--

31:11.537 --> 31:14.673
A LARGE BONE SAW--
ALSO NO KNOWLEDGE?

31:14.706 --> 31:15.607
- NO.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.677
- SOMEBODY STOLE
YOUR BROTHER'S SCRIP PAD.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.312
- [sighs]

31:20.346 --> 31:22.014
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN JESS.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.316
- REALLY?

31:24.350 --> 31:26.418
SO HOW WOULD SHE
HAVE ACCESS?

31:26.452 --> 31:30.122
- I KNOW THIS VIOLATES
CONFIDENTIALITY,

31:30.156 --> 31:32.524
BUT SHE WAS A PATIENT
OF MY BROTHER'S FOR A LONG TIME.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.792
SHE WAS A TROUBLED GIRL.

31:33.825 --> 31:36.428
HE WAS THE ONE WHO ASKED ME TO
GIVE HER A JOB TO HELP HER OUT.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.165
I-I THOUGHT THAT HE'D STOPPED
TREATING HER,

31:39.198 --> 31:43.202
BUT FOR ALL I KNOW,
SHE GOES BACK FROM TIME TO TIME.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.038
- I NEVER TOOK
DR. HAL'S SCRIP PAD.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.706
WITH THE WORK I DO,
YOU DON'T NEED PROPOFOL.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.309
- BUT YOU HAD BEEN IN DR. HAL'S
OFFICE--YOU WERE HIS PATIENT.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.311
- YEAH, BUT NOT FOR YEARS.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.946
- HOW LONG AGO
WERE YOU SEEING HIM?

31:53.980 --> 31:56.082
- I STARTED WHEN I WAS 14.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.184
I'D BEEN DIAGNOSED
WITH BONE CANCER.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.053
I WAS DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS...
[knock at door]

32:01.087 --> 32:04.690
- AND THEN YOU WERE STILL SEEING
HIM WHEN YOU WERE 15, RIGHT,

32:04.723 --> 32:06.058
WHEN YOU LOST YOUR LEG?

32:06.092 --> 32:07.226
- YES.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.963
[door opens]

32:10.997 --> 32:12.698
[door closes]

32:12.731 --> 32:14.700
YOU KNOW,
DR. HAL WAS GREAT.

32:14.733 --> 32:18.504
HE WAS SO SUPPORTIVE
AND ENCOURAGING...

32:18.537 --> 32:20.472
HELPED ME SEE MYSELF
IN A NEW WAY.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.141
- SO WHY'D YOU
STOP SEEING HIM?

32:22.174 --> 32:25.111
- [chuckles]

32:25.144 --> 32:27.746
I DON'T WANT TO SAY
ANYTHING BAD ABOUT HIM.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.282
- WHAT HAPPENED, JESS?

32:30.316 --> 32:34.286
- AFTER A WHILE, I STARTED
FEELING BETTER ABOUT MYSELF--

32:34.320 --> 32:35.421
JUST, LIKE...

32:35.454 --> 32:38.457
LIKE, STRONGER.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.659
BUT I...

32:40.692 --> 32:43.395
FELT LIKE HE DIDN'T WANT
TO LET ME GO.

32:43.429 --> 32:48.000
HE JUST KEPT SAYING
THAT I WAS NOT READY

32:48.034 --> 32:50.102
AND THAT WE
HAD MORE WORK TO DO,

32:50.136 --> 32:53.605
AND I JUST FELT LIKE
WE WERE STUCK.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.774
WE WERE JUST GOING OVER
THE SAME ISSUES.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.643
- "SAME ISSUES"?
YOU MEAN YOUR LEG?

32:57.676 --> 32:59.678
- YEAH, MY LEG.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.614
- DID HE EVER TELL YOU
ANYTHING ABOUT HIS MOTHER...

33:02.648 --> 33:04.083
ABOUT HER ACCIDENT?

33:04.116 --> 33:06.152
- MM-MM.
- WELL, IT TURNS OUT

33:06.185 --> 33:09.155
HIS MOTHER LOST HER LEG
IN A CAR CRASH

33:09.188 --> 33:10.522
WHEN HE WAS A BOY.

33:13.225 --> 33:16.528
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

33:16.562 --> 33:20.532
OH, MY GOD.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.801
- JESS, IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT DR. HAL WOULD'VE KNOWN

33:22.834 --> 33:24.736
ABOUT THE WORK
THAT YOU WERE DOING ON NINA?

33:24.770 --> 33:28.740
- [breathes shakily]
UM...

33:31.210 --> 33:33.679
WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE--

33:33.712 --> 33:36.515
YEAH, THERE WAS AT ONE TIME.
- WHEN?

33:36.548 --> 33:40.586
- AT THE OFFICE, HE CAME IN TO
DROP BY SOME KEYS FOR DR. GENE,

33:40.619 --> 33:43.655
AND NINA WAS IN THERE.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.591
SHE'D GOTTEN AN INFECTION
AFTER I DID HER EARS,

33:45.624 --> 33:48.360
AND SHE NEEDED
AN ANTIBIOTIC.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.596
SHE PULLED BACK HER HAIR
TO SHOW ME,

33:50.629 --> 33:52.464
AND...

33:52.498 --> 33:57.203
HE JUST KEPT
STARING AT HER.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.605
- SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT THE WRONG BROTHER.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.773
- I KNOW DENTISTS
ARE DEPRESSED,

34:01.807 --> 34:03.709
BUT IF WE'RE WONDERING
WHO THE CRAZY ONE IS

34:03.742 --> 34:06.212
BETWEEN A PSYCHIATRIST
AND A DENTIST,

34:06.245 --> 34:08.380
I'M GONNA GO WITH
THE HEAD SHRINKER EVERY TIME.

34:08.414 --> 34:12.484
- SUFFOLK COUNTY P.D. CONFIRMS
THE MOTHER'S CAR ACCIDENT.

34:12.518 --> 34:15.254
SHE LOST HER LEFT LEG
WHEN THE BROTHERS WERE 9 AND 13.

34:15.287 --> 34:17.589
- WHEN DID JESS LOSE HER LEG?

34:17.623 --> 34:21.127
- WHILE SHE WAS IN THERAPY
WITH DR. HAL WHEN SHE WAS 15,

34:21.160 --> 34:24.296
WHICH MAKES IT EARLY 2001.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.697
- ALL RIGHT,
SO, SIX MONTHS LATER,

34:25.731 --> 34:28.867
HE AMPUTATES
LISA THE PROSTITUTE'S LEG.

34:28.900 --> 34:29.868
WHY?

34:29.901 --> 34:31.870
- I MEAN...

34:31.903 --> 34:35.774
- MAYBE HE DOESN'T THINK
HE'S HURTING THEM,

34:35.807 --> 34:37.476
BUT THAT HE'S
IMPROVING THEM.

34:37.509 --> 34:38.377
- OR MAYBE HE DOES.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.246
BUT JUST REMEMBER,
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH

34:40.279 --> 34:42.748
TO TRY TO PIN IT ON HIS BROTHER
LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM.

34:42.781 --> 34:47.319
- SO WE LET HIM THINK
THAT WE'RE STILL ON THAT TRACK.

34:47.353 --> 34:50.322
- YOU REALLY THINK GENE DID THIS
TO THESE WOMEN?

34:50.356 --> 34:53.159
- I'M SURE THAT THIS IS
VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR.

34:53.192 --> 34:55.261
- HE HAD ENOUGH
MEDICAL TRAINING.

34:55.294 --> 34:56.328
HE ORDERED THE PROPOFOL.

34:56.362 --> 34:59.365
HE HAD AN ASSISTANT
WHO COULD HELP.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.133
- I NEED TO SPEAK TO HIM
ABOUT THIS.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.801
- DOCTOR,
WE'RE WAY PAST THAT NOW.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.804
- THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN HELP HIM NOW

35:05.837 --> 35:08.274
IS BY MAKING US UNDERSTAND
WHAT LED TO THIS.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.342
YOU KNOW,
PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE

35:10.376 --> 35:12.811
CAN BE A MITIGATING FACTOR.

35:12.844 --> 35:16.815
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING
FROM HIS PAST

35:16.848 --> 35:21.287
THAT CAN EXPLAIN THIS?

35:21.320 --> 35:24.256
- WELL, IT COULD HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH OUR MOTHER.

35:24.290 --> 35:28.760
SHE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.662
IT CHANGED EVERYTHING.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.664
- THAT MUST'VE BEEN HARD
ON BOTH OF YOU.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.400
- IT WAS TERRIBLE.

35:34.433 --> 35:37.169
IT DISFIGURED HER
INSIDE AND OUT.

35:37.203 --> 35:39.671
SHE LOST HER BEAUTY,

35:39.705 --> 35:42.241
HER LEG, PEACE OF MIND...

35:42.274 --> 35:44.676
SHE WAS IN A DEPRESSION
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.945
- WELL,
I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

35:46.978 --> 35:50.582
WHY YOU WOULD BECOME
A PSYCHIATRIST.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.718
YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.953
- MY BROTHER
HAD THE SAME MOTIVATION.

35:54.986 --> 35:59.358
HE SAW HOW LOSING HER LOOKS
AFFECTED OUR MOTHER.

35:59.391 --> 36:02.728
THE WHOLE LOWER HALF
OF HER FACE WAS WRECKED.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.597
THAT'S WHY HE WENT
INTO COSMETIC DENTISTRY.

36:05.631 --> 36:08.967
- SO HE HEALED THE OUTSIDE,
AND YOU HEALED THE INSIDE.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.737
- WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND

36:11.770 --> 36:15.441
IS GENE'S FIXATION
ON LIMBS AND AMPUTATION.

36:15.474 --> 36:18.677
- TO THE LAYPERSON,
IT SOUNDS BIZARRE.

36:18.710 --> 36:23.782
BUT I'VE SEEN TRAUMA
BECOME SEXUALIZED

36:23.815 --> 36:25.684
IN CERTAIN CASES.

36:25.717 --> 36:29.221
GENE WAS 9 WHEN OUR MOTHER
WAS DISFIGURED.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.456
- DO YOU THINK
THAT THOSE FEELINGS

36:30.489 --> 36:33.759
COULD'VE BEEN REAWAKENED AFTER
YOU INTRODUCED GENE TO JESS?

36:33.792 --> 36:36.328
- I'M AFRAID
IT'S POSSIBLE.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.498
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
FACING THE LOSS OF HER LEG

36:39.531 --> 36:41.833
WITH BRAVERY AND GRACE...

36:41.867 --> 36:43.769
- BUT THAT'S THE THING,
THOUGH, DOC, SEE?

36:43.802 --> 36:46.805
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT JESS'S SEXUALITY

36:46.838 --> 36:49.408
AWAKENED HIS OBSESSION?

36:50.909 --> 36:53.812
YOUR BROTHER'S GAY.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.514
- WHAT?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.249
DID HE TELL YOU THAT?

36:57.283 --> 36:58.784
- HE DID.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.686
- THAT CAN'T BE.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.621
IF MY BROTHER WERE GAY,
I THINK I WOULD KNOW IT.

37:02.654 --> 37:06.858
- THERE SEEMS TO BE
A LOT OF THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW--

37:06.892 --> 37:10.562
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER
OR YOURSELF.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.598
- THE PATHOLOGY
THAT YOU'RE PROJECTING--

37:12.631 --> 37:16.568
THE DETAILS DON'T FIT HIM.
THEY FIT YOU.

37:16.602 --> 37:20.406
- YOU WERE 13.

37:20.439 --> 37:23.675
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WAS HITTING PUBERTY

37:23.709 --> 37:25.577
WHEN YOUR MOTHER
HAD HER CAR ACCIDENT.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.779
YOU WERE THE ONE

37:27.813 --> 37:30.916
THAT WAS COMING OF AGE
SEXUALLY.

37:30.949 --> 37:33.885
- AND JESS WAS YOUR PATIENT
WHEN SHE WAS A TEENAGER,

37:33.919 --> 37:36.522
COMING INTO HER
SEXUAL MATURATION,

37:36.555 --> 37:40.492
WHEN SHE LOST HER LEG,
SO...

37:40.526 --> 37:43.329
YOU SEE HOW WE'RE
A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED HERE?

37:43.362 --> 37:47.299
- YES, AND I'M TRYING TO HELP
YOU PEOPLE

37:47.333 --> 37:48.567
TO GET IT STRAIGHT.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.802
- JUST LIKE
YOU HELPED NINA RAEDO?

37:50.836 --> 37:52.938
- I TOLD YOU--
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

37:52.971 --> 37:56.342
- WE KNOW THAT YOU SAW HER
AT YOUR BROTHER'S OFFICE, HAL.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.544
REMEMBER,
YOU COULDN'T STOP LOOKING

37:58.577 --> 38:00.812
AT HER...

38:00.846 --> 38:04.282
WHEN SHE MOVED HER HAIR
BACK FROM HER EAR?

38:06.652 --> 38:08.887
JESS TOLD US.

38:11.890 --> 38:15.794
- SHE SEEMED LIKE
A VERY VULNERABLE GIRL.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.997
AND AFTER I SAW
WHAT SHE HAD DONE TO HERSELF,

38:19.030 --> 38:21.400
I THOUGHT
THAT I COULD HELP HER.

38:21.433 --> 38:24.436
- HELP HER DEAL
WITH HER BODY ISSUES.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.372
- SHE HAD PROBLEMS
BEFORE SHE MET ME--

38:26.405 --> 38:30.008
BODY DYSMORPHIA,
SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.977
SHE WAS OUT OF CONTROL.
- SO YOU DID TALK TO HER.

38:32.010 --> 38:36.448
- YES, AND I OFFERED HER
LIMITED ADVICE,

38:36.482 --> 38:37.983
BUT THAT IS
AS FAR AS IT WENT.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.519
- BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM,
DOCTOR, SEE?

38:40.552 --> 38:44.390
WE HAVE VIDEO FOOTAGE OF YOU

38:44.423 --> 38:47.025
PUTTING HER INTO THE TAXI.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.898
- I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD SAY ANYMORE.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.901
- WE'RE NOT LIKE
THESE OTHER PEOPLE.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.903
WE KNOW THAT YOU WERE TRYING
TO TREAT HER,

38:57.936 --> 39:01.773
THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO MAKE HER
SEE HER OWN TRUE BEAUTY.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.376
- YES, BUT I DID NOTHING
TO HARM HER.

39:04.410 --> 39:07.779
- SHE'S DEAD NOW, HAL.

39:07.813 --> 39:11.483
AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND
HOW THAT HAPPENED.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.485
- YOU ONLY HAVE TWO CHOICES.

39:13.519 --> 39:17.055
EITHER SHE THREATENED
TO REPORT YOU,

39:17.088 --> 39:20.792
AND YOU INTENTIONALLY KILLED HER
WITH AN OVERDOSE OF PROPOFOL,

39:20.826 --> 39:22.828
OR...

39:22.861 --> 39:25.564
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.535
YOU'RE NOT TRAINED
AS AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST.

39:29.568 --> 39:32.438
SHE--SHE HAD
A BAD REACTION.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.078
SO WHICH WAS IT?

39:47.118 --> 39:49.421
- I TRIED TO WAKE HER UP.

39:49.455 --> 39:52.824
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD.

39:52.858 --> 39:57.128
I WOULD NEVER HURT
ANY OF MY GIRLS.

39:57.162 --> 40:00.098
SHE JUST...

40:00.131 --> 40:01.967
NEVER WOKE UP.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.602
- HAL, YOU JUST SAID

40:03.635 --> 40:06.705
YOU WOULD NEVER HURT
ANY OF YOUR GIRLS.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.707
WERE THERE MORE?

40:18.149 --> 40:20.552
- NONE OF THEM FELT ANY PAIN.

40:20.586 --> 40:23.221
I KEPT THEM UNDER
WHILE THEY WERE HERE.

40:23.254 --> 40:26.057
- YOU TOOK EVERY PRECAUTION.
I CAN SEE THAT.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.026
DIDN'T WANT THEM TO SUFFER.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.061
HOW MANY OF THEM WERE THERE?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.063
- SIX IN ALL.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.032
NINA WAS A TRAGEDY.

40:34.065 --> 40:37.002
BUT NONE OF THE OTHER FIVE
HAD ANY PROBLEMS.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.905
THEY'RE MORE COMPLETE NOW
BECAUSE OF ME.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.574
I TRANSFORMED THEM.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.743
WHY CAN PEOPLE ACCEPT

40:44.776 --> 40:48.179
SEX-REASSIGNMENT SURGERY,
BUT NOT THIS?

40:48.213 --> 40:52.183
- THIS ALL STARTED WITH JESS,
DIDN'T IT?

40:52.217 --> 40:54.019
- YES.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.987
BUT I NEVER LAID
A HAND ON HER.

40:56.021 --> 40:58.056
IT'S JUST THAT

40:58.089 --> 41:00.759
WHEN SHE LOST HER LEG,

41:00.792 --> 41:05.163
SHE WAS SO AMAZING.

41:05.196 --> 41:09.735
THE WAY SHE EMBRACED
HER NEW BODY--

41:09.768 --> 41:13.805
IT WAS THE MOST COURAGEOUS THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

41:13.839 --> 41:16.975
I THOUGHT ALL WOMEN
SHOULD BE LIKE HER.

41:17.008 --> 41:20.011
NOT LIKE--
- YOUR MOTHER.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.980
YOU COULDN'T SAVE HER,

41:22.013 --> 41:24.716
SO YOU SAVE ALL THESE OTHER
GIRLS BY TRANSFORMING THEM.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.117
- WHO WAS THE FIRST?

41:26.151 --> 41:28.887
- THE HOOKER--
SHE NEEDED HELP.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.889
- SO YOU WERE GONNA FIX HER
TO BE MORE LIKE JESS?

41:30.922 --> 41:34.059
- SHE WAS BETTER AFTERWARDS.

41:34.092 --> 41:36.795
I'D FOLLOW HER AND WATCH HER.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.897
- AND AFTER THAT,
YOU JUST...

41:38.930 --> 41:41.867
KEPT GOING.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.036
- EVERY FEW YEARS,
THERE'D BE A NEW GIRL.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.938
AND I'D PAY HER.

41:46.972 --> 41:51.910
AND SHE'D BE GRATEFUL
FOR WHAT I DID FOR HER.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.179
BUT THERE'S ONLY
SO MANY LIKE THAT.

41:54.212 --> 41:57.716
- AND THAT'S WHY
YOU WENT AFTER NINA.

41:57.749 --> 42:01.820
- IF NINA'S HEART
HADN'T STOPPED,

42:01.853 --> 42:04.222
SHE WOULD'VE BEEN GRATEFUL TOO.

42:04.255 --> 42:07.092
SOCIETY'S
NOT READY FOR ME.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.194
I CAN LOOK AT WOMEN

42:09.227 --> 42:13.765
AND KNOW HOW BEAUTIFUL
AND POWERFUL THEY CAN BE--

42:13.799 --> 42:17.135
LIKE YOU TWO.
YOU THINK YOU'RE SPECIAL?

42:17.168 --> 42:19.004
YOU'RE BORING.

42:19.037 --> 42:23.208
BUT YOU COULD BE
SO MUCH MORE.

42:24.275 --> 42:26.311
[handcuffs rattle]

42:28.747 --> 42:32.584
[handcuffs clicking]

44:32.503 --> 44:33.705
.
