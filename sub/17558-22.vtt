WEBVTT

00:13.214 --> 00:14.848
DAVID:
Look at it.

00:14.882 --> 00:17.351
It makes me so happy
that I could cry.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.853
All these months of planning,
and it's finally here.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.223
Our perfect day.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.558
I'm so glad that we decided
to do it in our home

00:24.592 --> 00:26.160
and not some cold hotel.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.162
Yes, our home is a
reflection of who we are.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.198
Do you know how many hours
I've slaved in that garden?

00:30.231 --> 00:32.032
Yes. Diego tells me
all the time

00:32.066 --> 00:33.834
how hard you work
telling him what to do.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.536
(chuckles)

00:35.569 --> 00:37.838
Our home, our
day, our way.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.507
The way we want,

00:39.540 --> 00:41.842
our choices, to
reflect who we are.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.711
It's everything
that we ever wanted.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.246
You're everything
I ever wanted.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.215
I'm just sorry that you didn't
get that one thing

00:47.248 --> 00:48.349
that you were hoping for.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.518
How you liking that wine,
Father Michael?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.852
You kidding?
After a lifetime

00:51.885 --> 00:54.054
sipping the sacramental swill
the church gets--

00:54.088 --> 00:55.556
no offense to BevMo!,

00:55.589 --> 00:56.757
our friends
in Christ--

00:56.790 --> 00:58.226
this is a real treat. Thank you.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.060
Um... so, Father, as you know,

01:00.094 --> 01:02.596
David and I are getting
married in a couple weeks.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.199
We would like you to marry us.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.402
Look, guys,
I'm all for nontraditional.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.537
But, uh,

01:09.570 --> 01:11.372
I work a very traditional job

01:11.405 --> 01:14.074
with very traditional
rules.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.777
You know, I'm sorry.
I really wish I could.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.779
Yeah, that one
sort of hurt.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.382
But who knows? Maybe our backup
choice will work out fine.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.451
(slurping)
How's that chocolate milk, Gary?

01:23.484 --> 01:25.553
Mmm. Fantastic.
I love to pretend I'm drinking

01:25.586 --> 01:26.754
milk from an African cow.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.256
And I've got to say,

01:28.289 --> 01:29.923
I would be thrilled
to marry you guys.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.226
Officiate, Gary.
We're not looking for a third.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.294
Well, as you know, I'm a pro.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.263
I ran a chapel
in Laughlin, Nevada.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.897
Married over 400 drunk couples.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.966
And I met Jeff Dunham,
America's foremost

01:38.999 --> 01:40.100
comedy ventriloquist.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.503
His dummy, Pumpkin,
came onto me.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.673
Stuck his little wooden hand
right down my pants.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.776
Look, I know it's not
your traditional choice,

01:48.809 --> 01:50.110
but isn't that the point?

01:50.144 --> 01:51.479
We're making
our own traditions.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.447
Oh, no! No, no, no!

01:53.481 --> 01:55.616
You're not supposed to see
each other on your wedding day.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.617
It's bad luck.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.452
Oh, Mom. We don't
believe in that.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.121
I don't care what you believe
in-- that's the tradition.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.090
Go. All right,
I'll take Bryan then.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.592
Uh...
(chuckles)

02:04.625 --> 02:06.794
David...
Let her have this one thing.

02:06.827 --> 02:07.795
Just promise me:

02:07.828 --> 02:09.963
our day, our way.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.365
No eye contact.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.000
(laughs)

02:17.037 --> 02:18.839
(sputters)
Stupid baby.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.474
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean that.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.510
You are a beautiful boy.
Beautiful boy.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.812
I love this tux
you made me, Mom.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.648
I feel like a seat filler
at the Academy Awards.

02:27.681 --> 02:28.849
Aw, thanks, sweetie.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.618
And who knows,
maybe the next thing

02:30.651 --> 02:32.853
you'll be making is
a wedding dress for yourself.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.858
Okay, out with it.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.160
Just tell me how you really feel
about your dad re-proposing.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.962
Come on, Mom,
how long does it take you

02:41.995 --> 02:43.497
to come up with two letters?

02:43.531 --> 02:46.867
Uh, but don't you think it might
be nice to be a family again?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.168
Like we used to be?

02:48.202 --> 02:50.838
No! We moved out here
because of how it used to be.

02:50.871 --> 02:54.007
Shania, he's the only man
I've ever loved.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.509
Well, once that baby plops out,

02:55.543 --> 02:57.978
maybe you should put on a little
lipstick and change that.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.480
Shake your ass a little, Mom.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.014
Whoa-whoa-whee-whoo, Shania.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.817
Look, nine months ago,
you had nothing to lose.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.052
You took a chance,

03:05.085 --> 03:07.521
and 'cause you did, I got
the best version of my mom

03:07.555 --> 03:09.523
and a dad I never knew
could be so great.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.692
If you say yes
to his re-proposal,

03:11.725 --> 03:13.261
all that could go away.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.195
Now I have everything to lose.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.204
Mama.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.874
David, you look so sexy!

03:26.907 --> 03:27.908
(chuckles)

03:27.941 --> 03:30.110
Ah! If you weren't
my son and gay,

03:30.143 --> 03:31.845
I'd eat you with hot sauce.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.046
(groans) Where's Dad?

03:33.080 --> 03:34.715
I thought you guys
were driving down together.

03:34.748 --> 03:35.949
Oh, we were going to,

03:35.983 --> 03:37.785
but then his girlfriend's mom
passed away.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.553
Said he had to be with Crystal.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.255
Oh, that's terrible.
How did she die?

03:41.289 --> 03:43.357
Lethal injection.
But never mind about that.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.725
Today's your big day.

03:44.758 --> 03:48.061
There's something special
I want you to wear.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.196
Voilà!

03:49.229 --> 03:50.398
It's the tuxedo

03:50.431 --> 03:53.401
your Grandpa Julie wore
on his wedding day.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.568
Mom, I can't wear this.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.404
Bryan and I discussed it.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.439
We promised
to do things our way.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.775
Oh, come on, David.
Don't ruin a family tradition.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.211
Now, where's that Goldie
with a needle and thread?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.646
We need to take up the crotch.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.349
You know how big your
Grandpa Julie was down there.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.418
(sighs)

04:10.451 --> 04:12.052
You okay, boo?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.721
Well, I hate to admit it,
but I'm scared.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.956
Mm. I know. I get it.
Cold feet, huh?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.057
Well, listen,

04:17.090 --> 04:18.592
David's dark inside,

04:18.626 --> 04:19.727
passive-aggressive
and you know what?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.929
I really think
he resents your success.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.597
It's better you realized it now.

04:23.631 --> 04:24.965
What are you talking about?
I love David.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.434
Oh, my God. Me, too.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.635
He is so sweet.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.470
No, Rocky, I'm talking
about the vows.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.271
We both agreed not
to write anything down,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.273
just to speak from the heart,
and now I'm afraid.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.742
I'm nervous
I'm gonna expose myself

04:34.775 --> 04:35.943
as someone
with human qualities.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.945
My son at his wedding.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.580
I remember crying
when you were 15

04:39.613 --> 04:42.115
because I thought I
would never see this day.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.785
I'd just found a magazine
under his bed-- Mirabella.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.154
Uh, Rocky, would you mind
giving us a moment alone?

04:50.023 --> 04:52.493
Look, Mom, I...

04:52.526 --> 04:57.097
I know that the last several
years have been... difficult,

04:57.130 --> 04:59.467
but I'm glad we made it through,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.935
and I really appreciate
you being here.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.271
I know your father
would be so proud

05:04.304 --> 05:05.806
if he were here.
You think so?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.140
Well, he wouldn't say it.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.976
You know, he'd just
complain about

05:09.009 --> 05:10.110
his overactive bladder.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.144
(laughs)

05:11.178 --> 05:13.180
Bryan...

05:13.213 --> 05:14.682
I want to walk you
down the aisle.

05:14.715 --> 05:15.683
Oh, Mom,

05:15.716 --> 05:17.017
I can't. I promised David

05:17.050 --> 05:19.052
it would just be the two of us
walking down the aisle.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.521
Please, Bryan.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.055
For me.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.691
And your dad.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.900
(classical music playing,
quiet chatter)

05:36.904 --> 05:38.706
Ooh.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.074
My girls!

05:41.108 --> 05:43.043
Oh, my God, Shania,

05:43.076 --> 05:44.512
you look like Janelle Monáe,

05:44.545 --> 05:46.213
except for a little taller
and paler.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.681
And, Goldie,

05:47.715 --> 05:49.517
I hear you could be the next one
down the aisle.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.684
Who told you that?

05:51.919 --> 05:52.686
(gasps)

05:52.720 --> 05:53.587
Oh.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.591
Shania, I have something
to say to you.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.927
The last time that I was
in this house for a wedding,

05:59.960 --> 06:00.928
it was yours.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.763
And I ruined it.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.865
I'm very sorry.
It's okay.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.768
Wilbur and I weren't ready
for that level of intimacy.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.037
(chuckles)
Oh, my God, if you would've

06:10.070 --> 06:12.740
told me then that I was
accepting an invitation

06:12.773 --> 06:15.743
to a wedding of two guys,
I would've hung myself.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.045
And I would've knocked that
chair right from under you.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.913
Here's to Bryan
and David,

06:19.947 --> 06:21.882
the happiest couple
I know.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.885
Whoa. That was a
beautiful speech, Nana.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.254
(quietly): Please don't tell
people that Clay proposed,

06:27.287 --> 06:29.089
at least
until I've made my mind up.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.391
Oh, you're so controlling
for a liberal.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.227
Okay. I'll tell you later,
but I just want you to know

06:34.261 --> 06:37.297
that I have some big news
about me and Brice.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.398
Oh.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.901
Now Rocky and I
are gonna get lit up.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.570
(laughing)

06:42.603 --> 06:43.737
Come on, Nikki.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.439
Shania, look.
A chocolate fountain

06:45.473 --> 06:47.641
right there.
Let's stick a shrimp in there

06:47.675 --> 06:49.042
and see if it swims.
Come on.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.143
Oh...

06:50.177 --> 06:50.911
Goldie.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.412
Oh, hey.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.482
I understand you
received a proposal.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.484
Are congratulations
in order?

06:56.517 --> 06:57.885
Honestly,
I'm not sure.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.086
All right, listen.
I don't know

06:59.119 --> 07:00.654
if I'm out of line
by saying this.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.955
I've been holding
this back.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.591
Goldie, you are
an amazing woman.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.259
You are. You're-you're driven
yet kind, you're funny.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.562
I mean, you're carrying a baby
for two guys who can't.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.997
You're like a beautiful
stork for gays.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.465
Brice...
Look around
this room.

07:11.499 --> 07:14.835
Look, every soul who you've
touched comes out better for it.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.069
I see you, Goldie.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.838
You transform life
into something new.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.673
And marrying your ex

07:19.707 --> 07:21.509
just feels old.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.810
CLAY:
Goldie,

07:22.843 --> 07:24.612
I dropped my prepaid phone
in the fountain,

07:24.645 --> 07:26.780
and then I tried
to fish it out with my keys,

07:26.814 --> 07:28.682
and now everything's
covered in chocolate.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.019
How do I look?

07:32.052 --> 07:34.655
Exactly like your father
did when we got married.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.357
Except handsome and skinny.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.693
Come on, Colleen, the
ceremony's about to start.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.529
Let's go to our "hot mothers
of the grooms" seats

07:41.562 --> 07:44.164
and scope out which cater
waiters we're gonna schtup.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.999
Uh, I'm-I'm so sorry,

07:46.033 --> 07:48.802
but I-I'm gonna be walking Bryan
down the aisle.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.137
Why didn't anyone tell me?

07:50.170 --> 07:51.338
I would've worn
something more revealing

07:51.371 --> 07:53.874
had I known I'd be part
of the processional.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.709
You got to put the fresh produce
at the front

07:55.743 --> 07:57.711
of the grocery store,
if you know what I mean.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.112
I do.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.348
Frances, I'm sorry. My mom
is walking me down the aisle.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.617
It's just something
we're doing together.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.718
It means a lot to her.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.354
Because my husband
is no longer with us.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.523
Oh. I'm supposed to be punished
because my ex-husband

08:09.557 --> 08:10.991
didn't die of tushy cancer?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.993
I want to walk my son
down the aisle, too.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.995
Just-- David and I are
trying to keep this simple.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.064
It is simple: if she
gets to, I get to.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.398
Colleen has six kids.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.400
She has five more chances
to do this again.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.170
You're not really gonna
deny me this, Bryan, are you?

08:28.041 --> 08:29.242
Welcome, friends,

08:29.276 --> 08:32.212
to this most blessed day
of marriage,

08:32.245 --> 08:35.048
a celebration of love
and commitment

08:35.082 --> 08:36.850
between Bryan and David.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.853
The Taoists commemorate
this joyful union

08:39.887 --> 08:41.689
with a timeless saying:

08:41.722 --> 08:43.757
(speaking Chinese)

08:46.093 --> 08:48.261
What is he saying?
GARY:
Nope.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.529
I think that means

08:49.563 --> 08:51.732
"I'd like to take a bath
with the two fat ones."

08:52.766 --> 08:54.267
(sighs)
David?

08:55.302 --> 08:57.270
Oh, my God,

08:57.304 --> 08:58.371
you look so handsome.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.207
I am the luckiest man
in the world.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.441
Oh, my God, you look insane.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.910
What in the hell
are you wearing?

09:02.943 --> 09:05.545
It's my Grandpa Julie's.
My mom made me wear it.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.047
And you couldn't--
oh, I don't know-- refuse?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.682
Or were you planning on going
straight from the wedding

09:08.716 --> 09:09.883
to perform magic
on a cruise ship?

09:09.917 --> 09:11.885
Everybody's shoving their
old musty traditions

09:11.919 --> 09:14.054
down our throat; this is
no longer our wedding.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.123
Well, do we have to go through
with it like this?

09:16.156 --> 09:18.391
Yes. I know it's traditional,
but it would mean

09:18.425 --> 09:20.594
a lot to me if we were married
before our baby came.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.729
I know, I know.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.563
David.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.564
Hey.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.299
May this tuxedo
bring you and Bryan

09:26.333 --> 09:28.101
the same bottomless ecstasy

09:28.135 --> 09:29.903
it brought my mother
and father.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.405
She couldn't walk straight
for two days after that night.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.742
What a lovely tribute, Frances.

09:34.775 --> 09:35.442
Okay.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.243
Shall we?

09:36.276 --> 09:37.244
Shall we what?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.146
I'm sorry. My dad is dead.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.614
Shall we what?

09:47.120 --> 09:49.322
Wrong finger, genius.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.503
Bruce, Bruce, Bruce.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.472
I'm pretty sure
that's for after.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.645
Okay. All right.
Thanks, Mom.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.458
What is...

10:25.492 --> 10:27.995
(quietly): You wrote vows?
I thought we were gonna wing it.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.997
We are gonna wing it.
I just planned mine.

10:30.030 --> 10:30.998
What am I supposed to do?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.132
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.167
(music ends)

10:35.335 --> 10:36.970
Dearly beloved,

10:37.004 --> 10:40.507
we are gathered here
today to witness as

10:40.540 --> 10:44.477
this man joins this man
with this man.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.213
Three men.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.715
Rather, two men...

10:47.748 --> 10:49.516
I'm so sorry.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.650
I don't want to interrupt.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.685
It's such a
lovely ceremony,

10:51.719 --> 10:52.519
but, um...

10:52.552 --> 10:53.821
I-I think my water just broke.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.822
(shouts)
Oh!

10:54.855 --> 10:55.655
Do something!
(electronics clicking)

10:55.689 --> 10:57.324
Oh, my God!
Get a towel.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.692
Ooh, help me, Jesus.

10:58.726 --> 10:59.659
Give her some...

10:59.693 --> 11:01.028
Just give her
some room.

It's nice
to finally meet you.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.697
I'm Bryan Collins.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.600
But you can call me...

14:27.634 --> 14:29.636
Dad.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.918
Say, "No more belly!"
No more belly!

14:44.952 --> 14:46.886
Although, there is
still kind of a bloop,

14:46.920 --> 14:49.222
'cause it's only
been two weeks.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.959
Hey, goggles, can I talk to
your mom for a minute, alone?

14:51.992 --> 14:55.195
Why don't you go work on
your Hillary Clinton impression.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.330
(mock laughing)

15:02.602 --> 15:05.205
Do you remember
at the boys' non-wedding

15:05.238 --> 15:08.475
I told you I had some big news
about me and Brice?

15:08.508 --> 15:09.709
You're getting married?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.544
Married? Are you
out of your mind?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.813
Goldie, Brice
is a booty call.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.650
He's perfect for a free-spirited
woman of today, like me.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.751
(laughs)
No.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.887
Brice and I had
a co-listing--

15:20.920 --> 15:21.989
this house
on Lindo Street.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.456
It closed.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.457
Yeah!

15:24.491 --> 15:26.093
It's a six-figure commission.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.260
Whoa.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.261
Goldie, don't you get it?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.397
We got what
we came here for.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.832
Okay. I know what you're
gonna say now, Nana.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.934
That it's time to
move back to Ohio

15:34.968 --> 15:37.470
so I can marry Clay and
raise Shania in a place

15:37.504 --> 15:39.772
where people still worship God
and football and spareribs.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.541
No, it isn't.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.776
Goldie, sit down.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.385
I want to say thank you, Goldie,
for changing my life.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.822
Look at what you've done.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.524
You came here,

15:57.557 --> 15:59.192
you got this
incredible apartment

15:59.226 --> 16:00.827
for you and your daughter,

16:00.860 --> 16:02.862
you started
your own business.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.999
You showed me how to be
an independent woman.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.334
And now I've got

16:07.367 --> 16:09.836
green in the bank
and a black friend named Rocky.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.839
(laughs)

16:12.872 --> 16:16.043
I don't ever want to go back
to the way things were.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.777
Why would you?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.346
I still love him.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.348
Fine. Love him.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.484
But don't you ever forget
what you taught me:

16:24.517 --> 16:27.820
you embrace your potential
and not your past.

16:32.725 --> 16:33.760
Shh.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.236
Who loves his daddy?

16:43.270 --> 16:44.904
Sawyer loves his daddy.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.306
Who loves his daddy?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.307
(beeping)
Sawyer.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.308
Sawyer loves his daddy.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.676
Who loves his daddy?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.211
Sawyer loves his daddy.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.580
Okay, now it's time for Sawyer
to love his papa. Gimme, gimme.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.249
Oh, no, the book says that at
two weeks he can see our faces.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.351
Let him enjoy this one a
while longer; it's so good.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.153
We agreed
on 30-minute intervals.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.421
It's my turn. Rocky?

17:01.454 --> 17:03.356
I told you-- you guys
should have gotten two.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.891
You know you don't
like to share.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.327
Me and Nikki have
a one-on-one ratio.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.262
Oh, okay, okay,
just wait.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.498
Do you have his head?
Do you have his head?
I know. Yeah.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.100
Oh, careful,
careful.
I got it.
I have his head.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.202
I have his head.
David, let go of his head.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.769
Hello, my dear.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.172
Hi, Goldie.
Oh. Look who I have!

17:19.206 --> 17:21.541
Oh, yes, he's the most beautiful
baby ever. Have you seen Shania?

17:21.574 --> 17:22.542
She slipped out,
and I thought

17:22.575 --> 17:23.943
she might be here.
Is she here?

17:23.976 --> 17:24.944
No. You can't find her?

17:24.977 --> 17:26.213
No, she's not
answering her phone.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.414
I'm so worried.
Calm down.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.415
You'll pop your stitches.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.782
If she has tracking on

17:29.816 --> 17:31.184
her cell phone,
we will find her.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.220
Okay.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.125
(seagulls squawking in distance)

17:38.158 --> 17:39.392
Shania?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.964
About time you got here.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.699
I'm a ten-year-old
alone on a beach.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.202
Do you know how many
modeling jobs I've been offered?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.471
We were so worried.
Why did you do this?

17:51.504 --> 17:54.006
I wanted to
show you that.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.109
I wanted to remind you why

17:56.143 --> 17:57.710
we came out here
in the first place.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.279
Look, you can't see
the end of it.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.281
We have a great life, Mom.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.283
I love our family
the way it is.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.618
What, just...
you and me?

18:05.652 --> 18:06.986
No way. Them, too.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.788
This is the family
we built.

18:08.821 --> 18:12.091
You, me, Bryan, David,
Rocky, Nikki and Sawyer.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.826
Why would we ever change that?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.696
Sometimes you are so
much smarter than me.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.200
Girl, it ain't just sometimes.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.574
I'm gonna say no to your dad.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.143
But... we are gonna
raise you together.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.512
And ground you together
for running away.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.046
Fair enough.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.953
David... this is all I
wanted our wedding to be.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.589
Just us, right here.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.257
This right now
is so perfect.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.827
I wish we could've just done
it right here on the beach.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.567
*

19:04.977 --> 19:06.213
What about music?

19:06.246 --> 19:07.614
I'll sing.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.882
But first I need to stop by
one of those "doctor" shops

19:09.916 --> 19:11.284
and get me a medical
marijuana card.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.852
Oh.
Girl, stop looking
at me like that.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.054
I got ocular pressure.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.823
No need, Rocky.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.158
You want us to get you
a Gatorade or a Pedialyte?

19:19.192 --> 19:20.793
All right,
just try to stand up.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.662
(Goldie laughs)

19:22.695 --> 19:25.898
Okay, so now we just need
someone to officiate.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.667
I saw a guy at Muscle Beach.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.168
He was wearing
a Supertramp Speedo

19:29.202 --> 19:30.570
and juggling chainsaws,

19:30.603 --> 19:32.639
but his sign said he'd do
anything for three dollars.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.406
Oh.
Oh.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.407
Oh. Go get him.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.508
Don't worry about it, guys.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.543
I have it covered.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.312
Father Michael!

19:39.346 --> 19:40.580
What are you doing here?

19:40.613 --> 19:41.748
You getting a henna tattoo?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.383
Do I look like a
13-year-old girl?

19:43.416 --> 19:44.484
(laughter)

19:44.517 --> 19:46.686
David called me, said
he wanted his fiancé

19:46.719 --> 19:48.488
to have the wedding
of his dreams,

19:48.521 --> 19:51.358
and that my being here would
mean so much to you, Bryan.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.493
It does. It's amazing.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.161
Mm, no, it's half-assed.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.264
What? I don't
have my collar on.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.233
Look, I once told you
to fight for change,

20:00.267 --> 20:02.235
but I can't ask you
to do something

20:02.269 --> 20:03.870
that I'm not prepared
to do myself.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.538
So...

20:05.572 --> 20:08.040
(sighs):
God help me... here we go.

20:08.074 --> 20:11.278
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

20:11.311 --> 20:14.347
to witness the joining together
of these two souls.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.616
Bryan, do you take this man

20:16.649 --> 20:19.619
to be your partner
in life, in love,

20:19.652 --> 20:21.621
committed to one another's joy

20:21.654 --> 20:23.690
and sustenance
from this day forth,

20:23.723 --> 20:25.392
so long as you both shall live?

20:25.425 --> 20:27.494
I do.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.298
And do you, David,

20:31.331 --> 20:33.566
take this man to be
your partner in life,

20:33.600 --> 20:36.068
in love, committed
to one another's joy

20:36.102 --> 20:38.305
and sustenance
from this day forth,

20:38.338 --> 20:39.806
so long as you both shall live?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.841
I do.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.647
Then by the power vested in me

20:47.680 --> 20:50.650
as a child of God,
I now pronounce you...

20:50.683 --> 20:52.084
a family.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.320
(laughs)

20:53.353 --> 20:56.323
(laughter, whooping)

20:56.356 --> 20:57.490
GOLDIE:
Yes!

20:57.524 --> 21:00.993
Well, no lightning bolts--
what do you know?

21:01.027 --> 21:03.029
* Close your eyes

21:05.031 --> 21:07.033
* Have no fear

21:08.868 --> 21:10.603
* The monster's gone

21:10.637 --> 21:12.672
* He's on the run

21:12.705 --> 21:15.875
* And your daddy's here

21:17.310 --> 21:21.113
* Darling, darling, darling

21:21.147 --> 21:23.149
* Beautiful boy.
