00:01.469 --> 00:03.469
Don't tell me what to do.

00:03.471 --> 00:06.005
Want to take out your phone?
Take a little video?

00:06.007 --> 00:07.439
You could show
all of your friends.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.041
Wouldn't that just be hilarious?

00:09.043 --> 00:10.175
No, I don't, Billy.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.744
Billy...

00:11.746 --> 00:14.413
Third door, north end,
west side.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.448
You know my name?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.517
See, that's
funny to me.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.069
Copy that.

00:20.070 --> 00:21.620
What do you usually call me?
Tell me.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.355
Sam, Jules.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.623
What do you call me?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.525
He's upstairs.
We're headed up.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.760
What do you call me?!

00:27.762 --> 00:29.595
(gunshot)

00:36.604 --> 00:39.671
(bell ringing)

00:39.673 --> 00:42.474
(chattering)

00:46.647 --> 00:48.047
Hey.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.648
Hey.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.151
Can I see?

00:52.153 --> 00:54.186
Uh...

00:54.188 --> 00:57.489
yeah, sure.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.557
Wow.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.292
It's amazing.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.094
Kind of looks like a map
or something.

01:02.096 --> 01:05.697
It kind of is, I guess.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.834
Like, you know when you see
those guys on TV

01:08.836 --> 01:10.536
with those big screens
behind them,

01:10.538 --> 01:13.205
and they have, like,
that map with a big
snowflake on it?

01:13.207 --> 01:15.140
See, what I think it would
be really cool

01:15.142 --> 01:16.775
is if we saw the people--

01:16.777 --> 01:19.144
like, drawings of, like, little
people, of course, but...

01:19.146 --> 01:20.679
and they're, like,
walking around

01:20.681 --> 01:22.381
being like, "Where
are my gloves?"

01:22.383 --> 01:24.783
Or like, "Where's my scarf?"
Or like, "Where's my jacket?"

01:24.785 --> 01:26.685
(chuckles)

01:26.687 --> 01:29.855
Well, what's your map about?

01:29.857 --> 01:32.424
I don't know.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.761
My life, or something.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.665
It sounds really stupid
when I say it out loud though.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.302
Is that you?

01:46.407 --> 01:49.174
Seriously, Billy,
it's really good.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.878
That's the thing about
art class, you know.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.880
Like, when I'm there,
I just... I feel happy.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.648
It's the only time
I really feel like that.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.785
I'll see you later, okay?
Yeah, okay.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.491
Hey, what's going on?

02:05.493 --> 02:06.859
Nothing.
Nothing?

02:06.861 --> 02:08.427
Yeah?

02:14.401 --> 02:15.868
Sorry about the detour.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.736
Sleeping Beauty there
couldn't get up in time

02:17.738 --> 02:19.338
to take the bus
this morning.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.672
No worries.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.774
Teenagers and mornings--
not a good fit.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.577
Well, teenagers and
anything-- not a good fit.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.745
(music playing through headset)

02:26.747 --> 02:29.414
How's school going,
Clark?

02:29.416 --> 02:31.450
Clark?

02:31.452 --> 02:32.784
What?

02:32.786 --> 02:34.820
ED:
<i> Mr. Parker's talking to you.</i>

02:34.822 --> 02:36.688
CLARK:
<i> I'm listening to music.</i>

02:36.690 --> 02:38.590
ED:
<i> Can't you just tell him</i>
<i> how school's going.</i>

02:38.592 --> 02:40.392
PARKER:
<i> It's okay.</i>

02:40.394 --> 02:41.426
School's fine.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.729
That's good.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.797
Yeah. See ya, Mr. Parker.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.566
Good to see you, Clark.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.839
"Thanks for the ride, Dad."
(car door closes)

02:56.477 --> 02:58.710
That takes some patience, huh?

02:58.712 --> 03:01.380
Yeah, you have no idea.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.884
Yeah.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.554
Yeah, I'm lucky I guess.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.793

03:22.303 --> 03:23.535
Scott,
leave him alone.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.636
Where you headed?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.471
Uh, the corner store.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.707
Yeah? Nutritious lunch?

03:28.709 --> 03:29.741
Cookies and chips?

03:29.743 --> 03:31.476
(laughter)
Stop it.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.544
SCOTT:
Stop what?

03:32.546 --> 03:33.745
You're looking
after K-Way here?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.581
Your little artist buddy?

03:35.582 --> 03:37.416
Come on. I was going to
give him some lunch money.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.684
God, Scott!

03:38.686 --> 03:39.751
What's your problem?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.220
I don't have a problem.

03:41.222 --> 03:41.954
Hey, let her go.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.555
BOY:
Whoa.
Excuse me?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.224
I said let her go.
I heard what you said.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.826
Then let her go.
Guys, come on.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.229

There's no "or else."

03:50.231 --> 03:51.697
Really?

03:51.699 --> 03:53.398
BOY:
Scott...

03:53.400 --> 03:55.267
'Cause I kind of believe in
"or else."

03:55.269 --> 03:56.268
GIRL:
Scott!

03:56.270 --> 03:57.903
Don't talk to me or else.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.373

04:03.510 --> 04:04.876

Get him!
Nice one.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.846
I didn't think gay
boys could fight.
I'm not gay!

04:07.848 --> 04:09.815
Yeah? Why are you
hitting yourself, huh?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.350
Why are you
hitting yourself?

04:11.352 --> 04:13.285

Oh, ouch. It's got to hurt.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.587

04:17.791 --> 04:18.924
Smile.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.263
Just say it.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.331
We all know the truth-- you're
a little piece of garbage.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.899
That's why you're eating
GIRL:
Scott!

04:27.901 --> 04:30.085

04:37.745 --> 04:40.779

I'm... I'm gay.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.447
And "I'm a piece of garbage."

04:42.449 --> 04:45.317
And I-I'm a piece of garbage.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.618

05:51.685 --> 05:53.685
Get me a beer.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.115
(knocking on locker)

06:23.117 --> 06:24.950
Decent?

06:24.952 --> 06:26.885
Yeah.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.020
So?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.522
So?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.891
First day back.
You nervous?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.860
Nah.

06:34.862 --> 06:38.029
So I heard, uh, I heard
you took some time off.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.865
Beaches and
margaritas?

06:39.867 --> 06:42.134
Yeah, a little R & R.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.935
But I also went
back to the base.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.871
Really?

06:45.873 --> 06:48.073
Wow, I thought, uh,
I thought you and your dad...

06:48.075 --> 06:50.642
When the General summons,
you don't say no.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.910
(laughs softly)

06:51.912 --> 06:53.912
What was that about?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.714
Well, he pulled some strings

06:55.716 --> 06:57.616
and he wants me back
in the military

06:57.618 --> 06:59.651
where I can really
make a difference.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.620
Nice.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.522
What did you say?

07:03.524 --> 07:06.658
I said I can make
a difference here.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.727
Good for you.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.928
He thought he heard me wrong,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.863
'cause it didn't sound like
"Yes, sir."

07:11.865 --> 07:13.832
Anyways,

07:13.834 --> 07:16.935
dealing with my dad, that was...

07:16.937 --> 07:18.904
that was the easy part.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.506
What was the hard part?

07:25.078 --> 07:27.913
When my mom asked
when she gets to meet you.

07:51.705 --> 07:55.140
Each fall the weather changes...
obviously.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.210
Cool winds
are being pushed south,

07:58.212 --> 08:00.712
but the Atlantic Ocean is still
warm from the summer.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.615
This makes for...
Can I help you?

08:05.118 --> 08:07.919
If you're not
in this class,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.921
you'll have to wait
till the bell rings.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.591

08:12.593 --> 08:15.093

08:15.095 --> 08:16.828

my classroom...

08:16.830 --> 08:18.129
Don't touch me, okay?

08:18.131 --> 08:20.532
I have no intention
of touching you.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.967
But you, sir,

08:21.969 --> 08:24.269
are disrupting my class.
Hey, buddy...

08:24.271 --> 08:26.137
Don't touch me. I'm just trying
to find somebody, okay?

08:26.139 --> 08:28.173
What's your problem?
I don't have a problem!

08:28.175 --> 08:30.275
You're not even in this class,
you loser. So get out of here.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.610
Don't call me that!

That's right.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.071

Team One, hot call.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.185
We have an active shooter
at a high school.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.054
Two injured.
First responders on their way.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.122

09:51.124 --> 09:53.124
48 days in phyiso,
four hours a day at the gym,

09:53.126 --> 09:55.093
double time at the range.

Yeah, I think I'm ready.

Lock down, intelligence.

10:28.362 --> 10:31.396
Subjects-- how many?
Where they at?

10:31.398 --> 10:33.865
We've got one gunman,
looks like a student.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.134
Two injuries.
That's all we know for now.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.837

that's a good thing, right?

10:38.839 --> 10:40.739

Depends.

Hi. I'm Principal Chivali.
Hello, ma'am.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.643
I got the alert
from room 312.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.744
We used a teacher's
intercom--

10:45.746 --> 10:46.845
predetermined code word.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.113
Which is?
"Code red."

10:48.115 --> 10:49.932
Sounds a little obvious,
I know.

10:49.933 --> 10:51.750
What happens with
a code red?
It means we follow the drill.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.251
But the teachers know
it's the real deal

10:53.253 --> 10:54.786
because it hasn't
been prearranged.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.254
Lock the doors.

10:56.255 --> 10:57.721
Make sure any glass is covered.
Close the blinds.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.691
Get the desks in a
barricade in the corner.

10:59.693 --> 11:00.859
Students behind the desks.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.327
As far as most of
the students know,

11:02.329 --> 11:03.795
this is still
just a drill.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.096
We do them every
few months.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.731
But all these kids
have cell phones.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.700
They're going to be calling
and texting each other.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.101
Who knows what they're
saying, what they know.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.337
That's why we're going to do
this quickly, keep it calm.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.007
You heard from Tony?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.242
No, I can't
get through.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.711
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Clear them out.

11:19.713 --> 11:20.979
Out of the way, guys.
Out of the way.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.113
Back it up.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.999
Police. Let
them in.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.884
SPIKE:
SRU on the scene, 1:37 p.m.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.920
Two shots fired
at approximately 1:21 p.m.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.156
Ma'am. Ma'am, where did

11:31.158 --> 11:32.824
the first
responders go?

11:32.826 --> 11:34.759
The, uh, first officers
on the scene.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.394
I don't know.
They just went in.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.164
We got one on each door, two
heading up to the third floor.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.832
Okay, Eddie.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.766
SRU only.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.768
We got to control this, okay?

11:43.770 --> 11:45.937
Ma'am, you got any further idea
who we're dealing with here?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.005
I mean,
with all the cell phones,

11:47.007 --> 11:48.006
somebody must have
seen something.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.241
Yeah, male, Caucasian, 15 to 17,

11:50.243 --> 11:51.710
hoodie, medium height.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.262
Definitely a Wellesley student.

11:53.263 --> 11:54.813
Possibly a sophomore,
but that wasn't confirmed.

11:54.815 --> 11:55.814
Okay, so, uh,

11:55.816 --> 11:57.182
white kid in a hoodie.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.783
Yeah, no, I know.
It sounds like

11:58.785 --> 12:00.351
half the kids in my school.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.955
This is Sergeant Greg Parker
with the SRU.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.790
All first responders
within the school.

12:05.792 --> 12:06.791
Everybody in.

12:06.793 --> 12:07.959
Subject is Caucasian,

12:07.961 --> 12:10.829
15 to 17, medium height,
wearing a hoodie.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.897
Do not engage.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.365
Come back to
the principal's office,

12:14.367 --> 12:16.868
which is considered
command post, ASAP.

12:16.870 --> 12:17.936
OFFICER:
Price, we got to move.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.388
Come on, everybody in.
Let's go.

12:19.389 --> 12:20.839
Price, come on.
They want us at command post.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.140
PRICE:
Okay, lock that door.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.441
15 minutes,
no further shots fired.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.776
PARKER:
Good.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.978
Okay, let's lock down
the exterior.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.096
Uniform on every door.

12:28.097 --> 12:29.213
All the kids
that are already outside,

12:29.216 --> 12:30.515
let's contain them
in the parking lot.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.750
Yeah.

12:31.752 --> 12:32.884
Sam and Jules
are Bravo team.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.319
Let's get a lay
of the land.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.920
Lou, you're with cops
and first responders.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.021
Spike, you're
with me.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.957
Let's monitor
all cell phone chatter.

12:38.959 --> 12:39.924
Let's stay on the intercom.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.926
Let's keep the
classrooms calm.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.194
No one in or out
unless they're being

12:43.196 --> 12:44.829
escorted by the police.
Copy.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.331
All right, Eddie.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.866
Injured first--
let's get them safe

12:47.868 --> 12:48.967
and any information we can

12:48.969 --> 12:50.335
on the subject,
anything at all.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.402
All right.
Let's go.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.319
(cell phone ringing)

13:10.857 --> 13:12.157
Just go to class.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.025
Answer your stupid phone;
I don't care.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.694
It's geography.
It's Mrs. Hilton.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.362
She's, like, a hundred years
old; she won't even notice.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.930
If you have something to say...

13:21.868 --> 13:23.868
I don't want to do this anymore.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.870
One month,

13:25.872 --> 13:27.372
that's what it's been.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.907
One month going out with you,

13:28.909 --> 13:30.475
and I don't even
feel like myself anymore.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.910
Okay.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.045
You beat the crap
out of my friend.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.847
No, I was sending him a message,
all right?

13:35.849 --> 13:37.048
That guy was trying
to get between us.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.383
He was helping me!

13:38.385 --> 13:39.984
You don't need help
from a guy like that.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.019
Guy like what?

13:41.021 --> 13:42.020
That guy is...

13:42.022 --> 13:43.121
What?

13:43.123 --> 13:44.889
Weird? A big loser?

13:44.891 --> 13:47.058
Yeah, well, so was I.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.560
Until a month ago,
when you decided

13:48.562 --> 13:50.962
that I was worth
the time of day.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.831
God, at least,
at least he's interesting.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.966
Okay? He's smart.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.267
Okay, yeah, see, there you go.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.836
Thank you very much.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.070
He's smart and I'm what?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.138
Huh?

14:00.140 --> 14:02.974
Just some jarhead
football player?

14:02.976 --> 14:05.043
So sorry I don't do
arts and crafts.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.078
Let's just go.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.166
Mrs. Hilton, it's the police.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.334
My name's Ed Lane.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.302
I'm with
the Strategic Response Unit.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.204
We need you to open the door.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.608
Ma'am, please open the door.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.943
We understand you've got some
kids in trouble in there.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.545
We're here to get them out.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.113
Thanks, ma'am.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.082
They're over here.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.417
Marcus Paley
and Rachel Heintzman.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.919
She's not moving.

14:47.921 --> 14:48.953
Marcus, you okay?

14:48.955 --> 14:50.955
Yeah.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.390
WORDY:
How's Rachel doing?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.391
Um, she passed out

14:53.393 --> 14:54.659
about five
minutes ago.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.228
Look, I-I'm
fine, I swear.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.130
Please, just get
her out of here.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.398
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.033
You okay if
we come back for you?

15:02.035 --> 15:03.201
Yeah.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.569
Okay, we need you
to stay calm,

15:04.571 --> 15:06.671
stay warm,
conserve your energy.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.039
Keep this tight.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.341
Watch your hands.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.044
It's my fault.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.648
I called him "loser,"
and he went nuts.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.149
I don't even
know who he is.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.151
I'm sorry.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.486
It's okay.
So sorry.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.520
It's okay, Marcus.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.823
It's not your fault.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.125
Guys, guys, we know
this is a dangerous situation.

15:27.127 --> 15:30.628
And we're gonna be back for you
just as soon as we can, okay?

15:30.630 --> 15:31.996
(students murmuring)

15:31.998 --> 15:34.015
But right now,

15:34.016 --> 15:36.033
the safest place for you to be
is right here

15:36.036 --> 15:37.502
with the lights out
and doors locked.

15:37.504 --> 15:38.503
You're doing everything right.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.204
Okay?

15:40.206 --> 15:42.106
You're doing
everything right.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.007
You have any idea
who this kid was?

15:44.010 --> 15:46.044
Jen thinks he might
be in tenth grade,

15:46.046 --> 15:48.680
but we just couldn't see.

15:48.682 --> 15:53.384
Okay, anybody-anybody have a...
have a yearbook?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.086
Here.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.087
Good.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.372
All right, while we're gone,

15:57.373 --> 15:58.656
I want you guys to look
through that book,

15:58.658 --> 16:01.025
see if you can identify
this kid, okay?

16:01.027 --> 16:03.044
We're gonna be
right back for you.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.062
Meantime, we're gonna
get Rachel to a hospital.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.965
You guys are
doing great.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.049
Wordy.
Yeah?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.132
We got to get her
out to the paramedics.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.203
They can't come in
under lockdown.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.007
Mrs. Hilton.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.750
Keep this door locked, okay?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.218
Keep the door locked.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.522
Guys, the news is spreading.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.991
Kids are texting each other.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.993
The phones are jamming
with 911 calls.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.160
Shooter hasn't been active in...

16:36.162 --> 16:37.528
18 minutes.
Good.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.163
Spike, stay on the chatter.
Hey, there's a kid

16:39.165 --> 16:41.165
up there with a gun.
We got to get up there

16:41.167 --> 16:42.400
as soon as possible.
Every second counts.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.668
PARKER:
Which is why
we're slowing down

16:43.670 --> 16:45.503
movement until we get
further intelligence.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.405
See, right now,
the subject is inactive.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.040
And by "the subject,"
you mean the gunman.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.345
Zero fatalities, two injuries.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.147
Sounds like
they were unplanned.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.415
Which affects
our subject profile,

16:57.417 --> 16:58.550
which affects our response.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.684
Okay, and what about
the injured?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.786
We're on it! Sir.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.088
Boss, I'm not liking
this cafeteria.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.090
It's too open.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.291
Sitting ducks.

17:07.293 --> 17:09.727
PARKER:
Yeah, agreed.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.062
Let's evacuate the lunchroom.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.263
And, uh, any stray kids

17:12.265 --> 17:14.149
you find in
the hallway,

17:14.150 --> 17:16.034
get them into classrooms,
safe and out of the way.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.836
(typing)

17:17.837 --> 17:19.637
Spike, we need to know who
this kid is and what he wants.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.139
I'm on it, boss.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.409
PARKER:
Alpha team?

17:24.411 --> 17:25.410
ED:
Almost back.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.477
Copy.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.164
Boss, we're headed
to the lunchroom.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.114
Police! Don't move!

18:03.116 --> 18:04.582
I said don't move!

18:04.584 --> 18:06.250
Jules.
Show me your hands.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.251
Step outside.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.319
Stand up
and turn around.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.720
Put your hands
on the counter.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.431
Okay, pal.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.200
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna take you to

18:22.202 --> 18:23.835
a place where someone's
gonna ask you a few questions.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.584
(gunshot)
(gasps)

18:39.586 --> 18:41.386
What are you doing?!

18:41.387 --> 18:43.187
There's a guy in the school,
and he's got a gun!

19:15.622 --> 19:17.455
Hey! Hey!

19:17.457 --> 19:19.290
Let us in!
They can't!

19:19.292 --> 19:20.291
Remember the drills?

19:20.293 --> 19:21.359
The doors stay locked.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.427
Once they're locked...

19:22.428 --> 19:23.494
Lunchroom.
We go to the cafeteria.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.462
No, we'd have
to cross the school.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.663
Make a run for the front doors.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.597
(door opens in distance)

19:26.599 --> 19:28.566
(gasps)

19:45.785 --> 19:47.218
(typing)

19:47.220 --> 19:48.853
We're getting reports
of a possible gunshot

19:48.855 --> 19:50.288
near the gym.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.722
We're getting a ton
of cell phone chatter.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.291
This is no longer a drill.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.525
The kids inside
know what's happening.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.794
Okay, boss,
we're at the west door.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.862
How's she doing?

20:00.667 --> 20:01.632
Not good.

20:01.634 --> 20:02.700
Let's go.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.437
Teacher confirmed
an ID of the subject

20:06.439 --> 20:08.423
from the yearbook, Eddie.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.408
Billy Dresden,
16 years old, tenth grade.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.609
We're trying to reach
his parents now.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.843
Any idea what he wants?

20:14.447 --> 20:15.680
Spike?

20:15.682 --> 20:16.981
Nothing firm beyond the ID.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.283
"Huge loser, loner, total freak.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.985
"Eats alone,
never talks to anyone,

20:20.987 --> 20:22.520
always wears
the same clothes."

20:22.522 --> 20:24.689
I found a picture.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.390
Okay.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.558
Let's start
at the gym.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.460
If he's gone
active...
You go in hard.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.842
PARKER:
Bravo team, what's your 20?

20:44.844 --> 20:47.478
Cafeteria's clear.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.413
Maybe not.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.681
Okay, go careful.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.316
We think the subject's
on the first floor.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.591
All right, guys.
We've got you.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.593
We're going to move slow
and calm.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.662
You're going to follow us.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.730
Boss, we've got about six
in here. We can't contain it.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.299
We're going to
take them out.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.767
Copy.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.802
Lou, we got six kids
coming out the west door.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.674
Everyone's out.
Cafeteria's clear.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.376
Alpha team's headed to the gym.
Bravo team stays east.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.610
Copy that.
You guys are back in.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.914
Ella, where the hell
are you going?

21:23.916 --> 21:25.950
I don't know
where else to go.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.428
Okay, we just have to hide
until it's over.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.063
Okay.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.631
Behind here.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.582
Billy.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.087
Well, this kid hasn't
killed anyone yet.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.622
He's had ample opportunity.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.691
Nothing on the Internet.
No creepy photos.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.659
No "Look at me
and my gun" stuff.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.994
Classic domestic scenario.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.796
Regent Park, projects,
poverty....

22:11.798 --> 22:13.731
Mom's unemployed,
dad's got a criminal record.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.866
Drugs, couple of domestic
assaults on the mother.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.668
Probably where he got the gun.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.970
Yeah, well, a kid like this,
no money, horrible home life,

22:19.972 --> 22:21.872
stuck in a fancy-pants
high school?

22:21.874 --> 22:23.107
It's a perfect storm.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.345
It's still no excuse.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.648
This is Gina Maxton.
Gina, hi.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.782
This is Greg Parker.

22:31.784 --> 22:32.917
Hi, Gina.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.452
I understand you know
Billy Dresden.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.786
From art class.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.688
So, what happened?

22:37.690 --> 22:40.858
Some guys near the field,
football guys mostly,

22:40.860 --> 22:43.728
they were shoving him around.
They were...

22:43.730 --> 22:45.730
putting garbage
in his face and stuff.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.898
Do you know who was doing it?

22:48.935 --> 22:50.434
It's okay.

22:50.436 --> 22:51.569
Gina.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.838
This is really important.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.945
Tony sent this to everyone.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.582
BILLY:
Please!

23:04.584 --> 23:06.617
SCOTT: He's gay. He'll say it.
No.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.120
SCOTT:
Say it!

23:09.122 --> 23:11.655
I'm gay.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.657
SCOTT: And you're a little
piece of garbage.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.559
BILLY:
And I-I'm...

23:15.561 --> 23:17.695
I'm a piece of garbage.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.465
Tony who?
Tony Price.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.701
GINA:
But it was Scott Mink, mostly.

23:23.703 --> 23:26.771
Alex Rosati.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.672
Okay. Thank you, Gina,

23:28.674 --> 23:30.841
for coming forward.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.410
All right.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.978
Let's get the locations
for all three subjects.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.079
If this is
target-specific...

23:35.081 --> 23:36.580
Could be good news.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.116
Eddie, this may be
target-specific.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.452
Stand by for locations.
Good news how?

23:41.454 --> 23:43.654
It means he might be looking
for specific individuals.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.790
Better if it's not random.
It's easier to contain.

23:50.897 --> 23:53.931
Okay. I'm pulling up the
schedules on all three names.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.468
Buddy, you got to leave
this scene.

23:57.470 --> 24:00.838
You're in big trouble if they
find out Tony's your son.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.139
Get out of here.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.208
Now.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.480
Got 'em!

24:09.482 --> 24:10.915
Okay, Eddie. You ready?

24:10.917 --> 24:12.716
Gym's clear. We're ready.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.830
Tony!

24:25.832 --> 24:29.233
I-I-I just need
to talk to you, okay?

24:29.235 --> 24:31.502
I know you're in there!

24:32.805 --> 24:34.839
(clattering)

24:38.811 --> 24:41.579
(shuttering)

24:43.483 --> 24:44.849
Please. We were just
getting a projector,

24:44.851 --> 24:46.851
but they locked the door.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.819
Tony, come out, okay?

24:48.821 --> 24:49.820
Come out.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.889
(sobbing)

25:00.867 --> 25:03.634
Please.
Please don't hurt me.

25:03.636 --> 25:04.802
(cell phone ringing)

25:04.804 --> 25:06.270
Don't tell me what to do.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.639
You've been doing that

25:08.641 --> 25:09.907
for two years now.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.643
All of you.

25:12.645 --> 25:13.844
But you don't get
to do that anymore.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.546
Okay. Okay.

25:15.548 --> 25:17.548
Tony, where the hell are you?

25:17.550 --> 25:20.518
I... Look, it's Dad.
I don't care what you did.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.887
Just please answer the phone.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.728
Uh, I'm just going up
to the command post.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.963
Want to take out your phone?
Take a little video?

25:32.965 --> 25:35.666
Some photos? You can
show all of your friends.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.601
Wouldn't that just be hilarious?

25:37.603 --> 25:39.169
No, I don't, Billy.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.039
Billy?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.774
You know my name?

25:43.776 --> 25:46.277
See, that's funny to me.

25:46.279 --> 25:49.046
Because what do you
usually call me?

25:49.048 --> 25:50.982
Tell me.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.917
What do you call me?
What do you call me?!

25:52.919 --> 25:55.953
It's not me
that calls you that, Billy.

25:55.955 --> 25:58.022
Please.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.928
Please.
Don't move!

26:03.930 --> 26:07.765
Keep your hands up
and go down the hallway.

26:07.767 --> 26:10.301
Go.

26:10.303 --> 26:12.236
And give me your phone.

26:18.911 --> 26:19.977
Sam, Jules.

26:19.979 --> 26:20.878
Outside the cafeteria.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.146
First floor looks clean.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.615
See you on two.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.185
(dialing phone)

26:28.187 --> 26:30.254
(busy signal)

26:31.891 --> 26:33.357
(dialing)

26:33.359 --> 26:34.725
(busy signal)

26:34.727 --> 26:37.127
Busy. How can 911 be busy?

26:39.932 --> 26:41.131
Scott.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.067
No one knows we
are here, okay?

26:43.069 --> 26:44.234
It's fine.

26:44.236 --> 26:46.170
I know, I know. It's just...

26:46.172 --> 26:47.738
Who would do this?

26:47.740 --> 26:51.075
Yeah, I know. Who
would be so vicious?

26:51.077 --> 26:52.276
(dialing)

26:52.278 --> 26:55.179
I'll keep trying.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.249
Guys, we're on
the second floor.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.819
Right there.
Right there.

27:01.821 --> 27:02.987
He took Tony down the hall.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.855
Which way did he go?
That way.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.323
I'm afraid he's
going to hurt him

27:06.324 --> 27:07.790
Calm down. Calm down. We
need you to stay right here.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.093
We're going to send somebody
back for you. Right there.

27:09.095 --> 27:12.396
Spike, student on second
floor needs retrieval.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.231
We are in pursuit
of subject.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.668
(Tony sobbing)

27:17.670 --> 27:19.637
Say it, Tony.
Say it.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.940
(sobbing):
I'm sorry.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.075
I don't believe you.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.777
I am.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.412
I'm sorry.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.414
Smile, Tony.
I'm so sorry.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.016
You're on camera.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.884
Please. Please.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.086
Don't hurt me.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.154
(gunshot)

27:43.429 --> 27:44.962
PARKER (over radio):
Team One, the situation
has just escalated.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.164
We have an active shooter.
It's a new deal.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.932
SPIKE:
Alpha team, respond.

27:48.934 --> 27:50.968
Are you in the vicinity
of the gunfire?

27:50.970 --> 27:52.803
Where are you guys?

27:52.805 --> 27:54.004
North stairwell.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.305
One shot fired.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.074
Subject may be
above us.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.342
Kids are saying
he may have a hostage,

27:58.344 --> 28:00.444
Tony Price,
one of the targets.

28:00.446 --> 28:01.679
If you need to,
you take him down.

28:01.681 --> 28:02.680
Boss, we're
heading upstairs.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.382
We're on the move.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.083
Boss? 911's patched in
a relevant caller.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.819
Ella Brandt, tenth grade.
Claims she knows the subject.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.054
(quietly):
Ella?

28:10.056 --> 28:11.155
Ella, hi,
this is Sergeant Parker.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.157
I'm with the police.
Where are you?

28:13.159 --> 28:16.694
Hi. Um, we're hiding.
We're okay.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.296
I just...

28:20.166 --> 28:22.433
It's Billy, isn't it?

28:22.435 --> 28:24.935
How do you know Billy, Ella?

28:24.937 --> 28:26.937
He's my friend.

28:26.939 --> 28:30.107
I mean, he probably won't be
after today.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.776
PARKER:
Because of what's happening?

28:32.778 --> 28:34.912
No. Because of what happened
to him.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.283
(cell phone ringing)

28:40.286 --> 28:41.752
TONY (on video):
I'm sorry.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.087
BILLY (on video):
I don't believe you.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.189
TONY:
I am!

28:45.191 --> 28:47.424
(sobbing):
I'm sorry.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.959
I'm so sorry. Please.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.294
Are you scared?
Please!

28:50.296 --> 28:51.762
Are you sad right now?
Because that's...

28:51.764 --> 28:52.996
(gunshot)

29:09.882 --> 29:12.216
Okay, Ella.
You just tell me where you are.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.218
We'll come get you. We can talk
about this in person.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.220
He is a good person.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.889
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.891
At least, he wouldn't have.

29:20.893 --> 29:24.528
I just... I just wish...

29:24.530 --> 29:27.064
I should have done something.
I could have changed this.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.033
No.
This isn't your fault, honey.

29:29.034 --> 29:31.001
When he was getting
the crap kicked out of him,

29:31.003 --> 29:35.072
I didn't have to just
stand there like some idiot

29:35.074 --> 29:38.842
while the biggest jerk in
school was going after him.

29:38.844 --> 29:40.978
He was standing up for me.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.947
He was defending me.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.151
Tony!

29:50.189 --> 29:51.989
Tony?

29:59.899 --> 30:01.465
Tony?

30:01.467 --> 30:03.333
Ella, you said "we" before.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.035
Who are you with?
How many people?

30:05.037 --> 30:06.604
I'm going to make sure

30:06.605 --> 30:08.172
that one of my team gets
to you as soon as we can.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.174
Just tell me where you are.
(door opening)

30:12.578 --> 30:14.244
(whispering):
Oh, my God.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.312
What's happening?

30:15.314 --> 30:16.413
He's here.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.949
PARKER: Who?
ELLA: Billy.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.384
Ella, where are you?

30:20.386 --> 30:21.952
ELLA (whispering):
I'm in the art department.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.287
Art department.
Okay. You stay put.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.588
We're sending somebody
right now.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.890
Guys, we got a 20
on our subject.

30:26.892 --> 30:29.259
Fourth floor, room 409.
Art department.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.494
On the south side.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.962
Alerting first responders.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.964
We got a 20 on Billy Dresden.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.299
No interference, okay?
Keep it tight.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.301
We're going to close off
the fourth floor.

30:39.371 --> 30:42.272
I'm going to go talk to him.
What?

30:42.274 --> 30:44.541
Ella, no.
You stay right where you are.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.376
You stay right where you are.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.445
He is my friend.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.315
I need you to believe me.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.616
He's a good person.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.251
Ella.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.253
(whispering):
Can you hear me?

30:56.255 --> 30:57.354
Ella.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.392
(whispers):
Stay here.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.639
Billy?

31:15.641 --> 31:16.974
Ella?

31:16.976 --> 31:18.408
What-what are you doing?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.945
ELLA:
I don't know.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.647
What are<i> you</i> doing?

31:25.451 --> 31:27.284
I just...

31:27.286 --> 31:31.288
I just wanted to see
what I'd done.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.424
You know, it's funny,
sometimes you think

31:34.426 --> 31:36.393
something's
gonna work out.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.594
Even if it's not beautiful,

31:37.596 --> 31:39.429
you at least think
that it's gonna work.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.431
And then... a few hours later,

31:41.433 --> 31:45.235
you come back
and you see that it...

31:45.237 --> 31:47.404
it's nothing.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.539
It just doesn't work.

31:50.676 --> 31:54.044
ELLA:
I think I know what you mean.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.412
BILLY:
You do?

31:55.414 --> 31:57.114
ELLA:
Sure.

31:57.116 --> 31:59.116
I feel like that all the time.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.655
Okay, guys, she's talking
to him; he seems responsive.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.223
Alpha team, what's your 20?

32:06.225 --> 32:08.525
We're outside 409.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.128
Window's covered--
we don't have eyes.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.629
We can be in there
in a split second.

32:12.631 --> 32:13.664
Copy. Waiting on Bravo.

32:13.666 --> 32:15.465
Bravo team, what's your 20?

32:15.467 --> 32:17.034
We're on our way.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.435
How many doors in the room?

32:18.437 --> 32:20.337
Two-- main door and a rear door.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.239
Sam and Jules,
head for the rear.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.374
Third door,
north end, west side.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.509
Copy that.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.045
So, what's bugging you?

32:28.047 --> 32:29.212
What's bugging me?!

32:29.214 --> 32:30.614
About the painting.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.116
You came up here to see
the painting, right?

32:33.118 --> 32:34.584
It doesn't go anywhere,
it's just...

32:34.586 --> 32:37.554
there's no point to it,
there's no place for it to go.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.423
It's just...

32:39.425 --> 32:41.725
i-it's just scared.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.394
But you're not
scared of me.

32:44.396 --> 32:47.197
I just wanted somebody to care!

32:47.199 --> 32:48.398
Some-Somebody

32:48.400 --> 32:50.334
to apologize.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.235
It's so stupid,

32:52.237 --> 32:55.505
and... I just made it
so much worse.

32:55.507 --> 32:58.308
I sent... a video

32:58.310 --> 33:00.477
out to all
of Tony's friends.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.547
I don't even know
what I'm doing!

33:03.549 --> 33:05.382
Billy...

33:05.384 --> 33:07.718
everyone is scared.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.621
You know what happened
after lunch hour?

33:11.623 --> 33:13.056
What?

33:15.027 --> 33:17.194
I told Scott that I...

33:17.196 --> 33:20.464
couldn't go out
with him anymore.

33:20.466 --> 33:23.333
I think you scare him.

33:23.335 --> 33:27.004
I think you freak him out
because you're smart

33:27.006 --> 33:29.139
and you're interesting.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.542
And because I like you.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.345
He feels stupid,

33:35.347 --> 33:39.449
and he acts like a jerk,
but it's not your fault.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.418
It's his.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.520
Billy...

33:44.490 --> 33:47.557
...it is not
your fault.

33:52.798 --> 33:56.600
This whole day,
it shouldn't have happened.

33:56.602 --> 33:59.603
I wish I could take it back,
I really do.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.139
Yeah. Me, too.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.178
I-I'm sorry.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.680
No, it's okay.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.482
Hey.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.318
I'm right here with you.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.320
Hey, you and me,

34:17.322 --> 34:19.122
together.

34:19.124 --> 34:20.624
PARKER:
Okay, he's showing remorse.

34:20.626 --> 34:23.226
He's de-escalating.
We got to let them play it out.

34:27.132 --> 34:31.601
Okay, why don't we
just go talk to them.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.303
Okay?

34:33.305 --> 34:35.472
But you got to put that down.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.775
Just put it down on the
table, and then we'll go

34:38.777 --> 34:40.710
and talk to them together.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.212
Yeah?

34:42.214 --> 34:43.480
Okay.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.481
Boss.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.649
Sam, Jules.

34:45.651 --> 34:47.417
Almost there.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.425
Are you good?

34:56.562 --> 34:59.229
Okay, 'cause I'm right here.

34:59.231 --> 35:02.132
Every step I am right here.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.701
Promise?

35:04.703 --> 35:07.337
I promise.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.539
Just put it down.

35:09.541 --> 35:13.243
Put it down on the table,
and then we'll go.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.611
Okay?

35:14.613 --> 35:16.129
Okay.

35:16.130 --> 35:17.646
It's gonna be okay.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.187
She's walking him out.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.555
We're getting him out.

35:25.557 --> 35:28.125
(crying quietly)

35:28.894 --> 35:30.560
(clattering)

35:30.562 --> 35:32.329
Who's there?

35:32.331 --> 35:34.731
Who's there?

35:39.705 --> 35:41.404
Scott? What?
You lied to me!

35:41.406 --> 35:42.506
No, no, she didn't!

35:42.508 --> 35:44.508
Okay, we've got
a third party in there.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.742
Go in! Now!

35:46.211 --> 35:47.310
Billy.

35:47.312 --> 35:48.345
Billy,

35:48.347 --> 35:49.412
don't worry about him.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.580
That's not who you need

35:50.582 --> 35:52.482
to be worrying
about right now.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.483
Where's Tony?

35:53.485 --> 35:55.552
I-I don't know.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.687
Look at me!

35:57.689 --> 35:59.623
We heard gunfire, Billy.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.558
ELLA:
Billy...

36:01.560 --> 36:03.660
please.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.794
Please.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.831
I just wanted you
to be okay.

36:07.833 --> 36:11.234
I just wanted
us both to be okay.

36:11.236 --> 36:12.636
(door bursts open)
(yells)

36:12.638 --> 36:14.437
Drop your weapon!

36:17.709 --> 36:19.342
Put the gun down! Now!

36:19.344 --> 36:20.410
Do it now!

36:20.412 --> 36:21.478
Put the gun down!

36:21.480 --> 36:22.779
Get down!
Get down now!

36:29.721 --> 36:30.954
I repeat: subject's contained,
he has been shot.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.822
Guys, let's get
this kid out of here.

36:32.824 --> 36:33.823
He's still breathing. Jules?

36:33.825 --> 36:35.225
Ella, it's okay,
sweetheart.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.793
It's okay, you're safe.
Go with Jules.

36:36.795 --> 36:37.827
That's it.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.296
Ella?

36:39.298 --> 36:40.363
Ella?

36:40.365 --> 36:41.598
ELLA:
Get away from me!

36:41.600 --> 36:43.266
Down on your knees,
hands behind your back.

36:43.268 --> 36:45.468
Why? What did<i> I</i> do?
Just do it, please, sir.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.372
My son Tony
was one of the targets.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.908
He killed my boy.

36:54.246 --> 36:55.745
Come on, let's go.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.981
Yeah, put him on.

36:59.685 --> 37:02.319
Somebody wants to talk to you.

37:02.321 --> 37:02.886
Dad?

37:02.888 --> 37:04.487
Tony?

37:04.489 --> 37:06.423
I'm okay.

37:06.425 --> 37:09.359
(sobbing):
Tony, you're okay...

37:09.361 --> 37:11.728
He just wanted me
to say I'm sorry.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.797
Tony...

37:13.799 --> 37:15.532
PRICE:
Oh, my God.

37:15.534 --> 37:16.733
Oh, my God.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.802
I've got a son;
he's in high school, too.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.337
So I get it, all right?

37:20.339 --> 37:22.405
I... I get it.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.742
(sobbing quietly)

37:25.744 --> 37:27.677
But this is our job,

37:27.679 --> 37:29.813
and you got to let us do it.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.281
(sobbing, sniffling)

37:31.283 --> 37:33.016
I'm sorry.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.420
Yeah, me, too, buddy.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.823
Me, too.

37:40.993 --> 37:43.026
(Price sobbing)

37:43.996 --> 37:46.863
Son of a bitch.

37:49.935 --> 37:53.270
(guitar playing gentle melody)

38:09.755 --> 38:11.888
¶ A million tears ¶

38:11.890 --> 38:14.958
¶ A million codes ¶

38:14.960 --> 38:17.560
¶ One-fifteen ¶

38:17.562 --> 38:19.829
¶ No where to go ¶

38:19.831 --> 38:22.565
¶ You point your finger ¶

38:22.567 --> 38:24.768
¶ To the moon ¶

38:24.770 --> 38:27.937
¶ It looks like rain ¶

38:27.939 --> 38:30.473
¶ Coming soon ¶

38:30.475 --> 38:32.475
¶ I figured all ¶

38:32.477 --> 38:34.911
¶ My worst fears ¶

38:34.913 --> 38:39.783
¶ Believe in
childlike heroes ¶

38:39.785 --> 38:42.819
¶ But I don't want to go ¶

38:42.821 --> 38:44.854
¶ That way ¶

38:44.856 --> 38:48.658
¶ Surrender hope ¶

38:48.660 --> 38:50.093
¶ Again ¶

38:50.095 --> 38:52.896
¶ I don't want to go ¶

38:52.898 --> 38:55.765
¶ That way ¶

38:55.767 --> 38:57.834
¶ Surrender hope ¶

38:57.836 --> 39:00.970
¶ And faith ¶

39:00.972 --> 39:02.972
¶ Again ¶

39:02.974 --> 39:05.975
¶ ¶

39:08.780 --> 39:10.847
Boss, this is Ella.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.782
Ella, hey.

39:12.784 --> 39:13.850
I'm Greg.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.952
I was on the phone
with you.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.988
You did great.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.790
You did everything right.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.893
¶ Your blood, your fire ¶

39:23.895 --> 39:25.995
¶ Your kiss good night ¶

39:25.997 --> 39:28.832
¶ Your words and touch ¶

39:28.834 --> 39:31.901
Billy's on his way
to St. Mike's.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.903
He's gonna make it.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.406
Because you were there
to help him.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.575
'Cause you were there.

39:38.577 --> 39:41.444
¶ Feel that way... ¶

39:44.916 --> 39:46.015
I think that's your mom.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.083
I think she's waiting for you.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.718
You want to turn around

39:48.720 --> 39:50.754
and tell me
if that's your mom?

39:52.758 --> 39:53.957
Is that your mom?

39:53.959 --> 39:54.991
Yeah.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.626
You go, go on.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.027
¶ The fire ¶

39:58.029 --> 40:01.431
¶ Linger and fade away ¶

40:01.433 --> 40:04.467
¶ The shadows run ¶

40:04.469 --> 40:06.403
¶ From yesterday ¶

40:06.405 --> 40:08.438
¶ Like everyone ¶

40:08.440 --> 40:09.839
Welcome back.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.608
Yeah.
¶ And everything ¶

40:11.610 --> 40:13.143
¶ Were memories ¶

40:13.145 --> 40:16.946
¶ And might-have-beens ¶

40:16.948 --> 40:19.616
¶ Your blood, your fire ¶

40:19.618 --> 40:22.018
¶ Your kiss good night ¶

40:22.020 --> 40:24.521
¶ Your words and touch ¶

40:24.523 --> 40:26.990
¶ They might be mine ¶

40:26.992 --> 40:29.592
¶ I feel this love ¶

40:29.594 --> 40:31.995
¶ Could cross the sand ¶

40:31.997 --> 40:33.997
¶ I want to feel ¶

40:33.999 --> 40:35.965
¶ That way ¶

40:35.967 --> 40:38.968
¶ Oh, don't want to feel ¶

40:38.970 --> 40:40.970
¶ That way ¶

40:40.972 --> 40:45.642
¶ Oh, don't make me feel
that way ¶

40:45.644 --> 40:49.045
¶ Oh, don't want to feel ¶

40:49.047 --> 40:51.114
¶ That way ¶

40:53.652 --> 40:56.152
¶ I'm breaking through ¶

40:56.154 --> 40:58.888
¶ These walls of steel ¶

40:58.890 --> 41:01.224
¶ Pushing that wall ¶

41:01.226 --> 41:03.693
¶ For something real ¶

41:03.695 --> 41:05.995
¶ I'm falling far ¶

41:05.997 --> 41:08.932
¶ And faster still ¶

41:08.934 --> 41:11.468
¶ Wake up, wake up ¶

41:11.470 --> 41:13.069
¶ Wake up, wake... ¶

41:13.071 --> 41:17.006
You can't keep doing this
to yourself.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.042
¶ Wake up... ¶

41:20.579 --> 41:23.079
I miss my boy.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.984
I know.
