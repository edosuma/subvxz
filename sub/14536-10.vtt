WEBVTT

00:09.234 --> 00:10.383
She looks so beautiful.

00:10.419 --> 00:11.710
She's a'ight.

00:14.398 --> 00:16.348
Seasonal allergies?

00:16.383 --> 00:19.234
No, I always cry at weddings.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.887
Technically, I always cry
when I'm forced to wear a dress.

00:23.832 --> 00:25.098
Please be seated.

00:27.469 --> 00:30.028
Dearly beloved,

00:30.063 --> 00:33.223
I am so happy to be
invited here today

00:33.258 --> 00:35.751
to join these two people
together.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.011
Joining two people?

00:38.046 --> 00:41.765
What sick games are they
playing in this place?

00:41.800 --> 00:43.675
Judy, it's
a metaphorical joining.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.111
He's joining them
together in marriage

00:46.147 --> 00:47.691
because they're the perfect
people for each other.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.482
Can't he join them
somewhere more comfortable?

00:50.517 --> 00:52.401
This place can afford
a pipe organ,

00:52.436 --> 00:54.711
but we can't get
some seat cushions up in here?

00:54.747 --> 00:57.072
What are you complaining about?

00:57.107 --> 00:59.232
Your butt is made
out of titanium.

00:59.268 --> 01:01.751
Judy's right. These seats
are tough on the butt.

01:01.787 --> 01:04.529
And mine's just made
out of regular tushy meat.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.973
Ernie, watch your language.
We're in a church.

01:07.008 --> 01:08.486
Although truth be told,
I can barely feel

01:08.510 --> 01:11.344
my right cheek.

01:11.380 --> 01:13.830
Marriage is not to be
entered into lightly,

01:13.865 --> 01:16.058
but with mindfulness

01:16.093 --> 01:18.435
that this commitment is forever.

01:18.470 --> 01:20.154
You know what feels
like forever?

01:20.189 --> 01:21.321
This ceremony.

01:24.660 --> 01:25.979
Dad, will you tell Judy that marriage
is a beautiful part of life?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.435
Oh, I like marriage.

01:27.471 --> 01:29.312
I just don't like

01:29.347 --> 01:30.608
having to buy the happy couple
a $300 toaster.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.516
This ring symbolizes

01:33.552 --> 01:36.195
your commitment to each other

01:36.230 --> 01:38.722
Why does this random dude
decide that they're married?

01:38.757 --> 01:40.423
Judy, he's not a random dude.

01:40.458 --> 01:43.910
He's a kind-hearted guy
who has spent his entire life

01:43.945 --> 01:45.305
dedicated to helping
the community.

01:47.433 --> 01:48.557
( Screaming )

02:03.432 --> 02:06.116
Well, I guess that's worth
the price of the toaster.

02:08.921 --> 02:11.238
Okay, so just to be clear,

02:11.273 --> 02:13.197
you're saying that that preacher

02:13.233 --> 02:15.233
was actually an agent
for the Other Side.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.927
Working deep cover.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.903
That preacher was no preacher.

02:18.938 --> 02:20.314
He wasn't even ordained.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.931
That makes no sense.

02:21.966 --> 02:23.876
We've known him forever.

02:23.911 --> 02:24.767
He married us,
for goodness sake.

02:24.803 --> 02:26.444
Are you sure?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.622
I would know. I was there.

02:29.658 --> 02:31.424
And I paid for it.

02:31.459 --> 02:33.902
Wait.

02:33.937 --> 02:35.670
If he wasn't ordained,

02:35.706 --> 02:38.365
then that means...

02:38.400 --> 02:39.844
I now pronounce you
not really husband

02:39.868 --> 02:41.234
and not really wife.

02:44.248 --> 02:48.033
I guess you may now kiss
anyone you want.

02:50.220 --> 02:53.813
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

02:53.848 --> 02:57.009
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

02:57.085 --> 02:59.970
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

03:00.005 --> 03:05.108
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

03:05.144 --> 03:08.812
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

03:08.847 --> 03:10.863
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

03:10.899 --> 03:14.934
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

03:14.969 --> 03:18.913
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

03:18.949 --> 03:20.982
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

03:21.017 --> 03:23.260
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

03:23.295 --> 03:25.445
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

03:25.481 --> 03:27.555
¶ But I always got your back ¶

03:27.590 --> 03:29.441
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

03:29.476 --> 03:31.685
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

03:31.720 --> 03:34.321
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

03:34.356 --> 03:35.630
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

03:35.665 --> 03:38.033
I keep it undercover.

03:38.068 --> 03:39.068
I keep it undercover.

03:46.735 --> 03:48.546
I cannot believe we are sitting around
here like nothing even happened.

03:48.570 --> 03:51.404
Ernie apologized,
we lit a match.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.507
We're all moving on
with our lives.

03:54.543 --> 03:55.995
Dad, I'm talking about
you not actually being married.

03:56.019 --> 03:58.119
I call a family meeting.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.595
If you were never
actually married,

03:59.631 --> 04:01.292
that means our entire
lives have been a lie.

04:01.316 --> 04:02.816
Our family's a sham.
We are a shamily.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.144
What was your first clue?

04:06.179 --> 04:08.805
The robot sister?

04:08.841 --> 04:11.375
KC, come on, relax.

04:11.451 --> 04:13.146
We'll make it official,
go down to the courthouse,

04:13.170 --> 04:15.354
and take care of it tomorrow.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.350
No, tomorrow's the deadline
for my fantasy football picks.

04:17.374 --> 04:19.374
- Craig.
- Yay, we're getting married tomorrow!

04:21.060 --> 04:22.193
Come on, let's go to bed.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.237
All right.

04:24.272 --> 04:26.873
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Separate rooms, okay,

04:26.908 --> 04:29.109
until you're officially married.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.529
Mom, you're gonna be in my room,
Dad, you bunk with Ernie.

04:30.553 --> 04:31.953
And who's sleeping in our room?

04:31.988 --> 04:33.772
Me. My parents
are getting married,

04:33.807 --> 04:35.223
I need a good night's sleep.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.146
Oh, okay, look at you, girl.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.983
Is it picture day or something?

04:45.018 --> 04:46.896
I wish I would've known. I'd
have worn my fancy plaid shirt.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.096
As I have mentioned
countless times,

04:50.131 --> 04:52.157
there is no such thing
as a fancy plaid shirt.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.880
And I am dressed like this
for after school.

04:55.904 --> 04:58.321
Where you going?

04:58.356 --> 05:01.157
Formal detention?

05:01.193 --> 05:02.269
No. I am doing
inventory at the food bank,

05:02.293 --> 05:05.386
and I wanna look good.

05:05.422 --> 05:08.781
Uh, Marisa, you do know that potatoes
don't have actual eyes, right?

05:08.817 --> 05:11.393
No, but Adam does,

05:11.395 --> 05:14.128
and now that we are dating
and working together,

05:14.164 --> 05:16.173
I can't go in looking
anything but my best.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.499
Okay. As long as
the hungry get fed.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.151
The who?

05:20.187 --> 05:23.138
Oh... yeah!

05:23.173 --> 05:26.333
Of course. It is all about them.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.109
Obviously.

05:30.380 --> 05:31.938
Thanks for carrying
my books, Ernie.

05:31.973 --> 05:34.407
Any time, Akina.

05:34.442 --> 05:35.787
Sorry you had to carry them
for a minute.

05:35.811 --> 05:37.218
I didn't like the idea
of your books

05:37.254 --> 05:38.614
being inside of
the boys' bathroom.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.740
So am I supposed to hug you

05:42.776 --> 05:44.621
before you get to class or
when I pick you up after?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.135
Or do we hug twice?

05:46.170 --> 05:47.471
Unless it's too much,

05:47.506 --> 05:49.597
and you'd rather mix in
the occasional fist bump.

05:49.633 --> 05:51.299
See you later.

05:51.335 --> 05:53.718
Later as in later later,

05:53.753 --> 05:55.106
or later as in
you're breaking up with me?

05:55.130 --> 05:56.821
You're so funny.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.932
I'm not funny, I'm worried.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.164
Can I give you
a little dating advice, bro?

06:03.188 --> 06:07.874
Dating advice from the famous
love expert KC Cooper?

06:07.909 --> 06:10.163
Hey, maybe when you're done, you
can go down to the mayor's office

06:10.187 --> 06:12.496
and help with
the housing crisis.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.612
Oh, wait, you don't know
anything about that either.

06:16.159 --> 06:17.959
I do know that Akina likes you.

06:17.994 --> 06:21.362
I just don't know why.

06:21.398 --> 06:23.151
So forget the craziness
in your head and just enjoy it.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.215
It may never happen again.

06:27.879 --> 06:29.613
She's right.
I better keep Akina happy,

06:29.648 --> 06:32.924
or I wasted a lot of money
on that bicycle built for two.

06:39.073 --> 06:41.191
Really romantic spot
for a wedding.

06:41.226 --> 06:44.319
Was the mortuary not available?

06:44.354 --> 06:46.629
They have to get their license.

06:46.664 --> 06:48.990
Then it's all about
love and romance.

06:49.025 --> 06:51.500
In fact, where are Mom and Dad?

06:51.536 --> 06:53.169
Forget them. Where's Akina?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.438
I texted her ten minutes ago.

06:55.474 --> 06:58.183
I was afraid of this.
It's all coming apart!

06:58.218 --> 07:00.660
No, you're coming apart, man.
Get it together, little boy.

07:02.822 --> 07:06.333
- Where were you guys?
- Food Warehouse.

07:06.368 --> 07:08.885
Let's move this along. I got 12
pounds of tilapia in the car.

07:08.921 --> 07:13.264
Yeah, we ran out of change so we
only have ten minutes on the meter.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.261
Ooh, you know what? Ask those
people in front if we can cut in.

07:15.285 --> 07:17.368
Guys, this is your wedding day.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.354
Can we not put
a time limit on it?

07:19.389 --> 07:20.755
And Dad, what are you wearing?

07:20.790 --> 07:23.699
These are my comfy pants.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.228
No, those are sweat pants,
with stains on them.

07:27.263 --> 07:27.896
Did you get a pizza
at the Food Warehouse?

07:27.931 --> 07:30.140
Of course not.

07:30.175 --> 07:32.492
They were giving 'em away.

07:32.527 --> 07:33.860
Why buy it if you can try it?

07:36.047 --> 07:38.906
And he tried it six times.

07:38.941 --> 07:40.581
Brought some of
my quick-change disguises.

07:44.781 --> 07:46.506
Come on, guys, this is
not romantic at all.

07:46.541 --> 07:48.383
Oh, KC, would you just stop?

07:48.418 --> 07:49.537
Come on, let's just
get this over with.

07:49.561 --> 07:51.035
You were right, KC.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.504
This is romantic.

07:54.490 --> 07:55.707
Next.<i> Next!!</i>

07:55.742 --> 07:57.217
Okay.

08:12.834 --> 08:15.384
- I object.
- Excuse me.

08:15.419 --> 08:17.153
That's right, I object.

08:17.188 --> 08:18.796
I object too.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.940
Akina should be here with us.

08:20.975 --> 08:21.975
She's practically family.

08:24.146 --> 08:26.178
Guys, this is not how
it's supposed to go.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.856
KC, I thought this
is what you wanted.

08:27.891 --> 08:31.050
No. I want you guys
to have a real wedding.

08:31.085 --> 08:33.536
A big one with dresses,

08:33.572 --> 08:35.638
and flowers and music
and a real preacher,

08:35.673 --> 08:37.657
and our friends
and family to be there.

08:37.692 --> 08:38.675
I don't even care
if you don't wanna do it,

08:38.710 --> 08:40.960
because like you two are
gonna say to each other later,

08:40.995 --> 08:42.136
I do.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.186
Hey, Dad, I've been making
arrangements for the wedding,

08:58.221 --> 09:00.580
but before I finalize anything,

09:00.657 --> 09:02.832
you have to ask Pops
for Mom's hand in marriage.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.377
Why? I already got her hand,

09:05.412 --> 09:06.839
and her foot
and everything in between.

09:06.863 --> 09:09.155
It's tradition.

09:09.191 --> 09:11.499
( Muffled ) Fine.
I'll shoot him an email.

09:11.534 --> 09:13.818
No need. Okay?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.295
- Pops!
- Yeah?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.658
( Muffled ) What the heck
are you doing here?

09:20.693 --> 09:24.053
And howdy do to you, too.

09:24.088 --> 09:25.650
KC's saying you got
an important question.

09:25.674 --> 09:28.066
Let me guess.

09:28.143 --> 09:29.100
How do you get salsa stains
out of sweat pants?

09:29.135 --> 09:33.004
Because the answer is you can't.
You gotta buy new pants.

09:33.039 --> 09:36.591
Go ahead, Dad. Ask Pops
your important question.

09:36.626 --> 09:39.160
Fine. May I have your permission
to marry Kira/

09:39.195 --> 09:41.437
It doesn't sound like
you very excited

09:41.473 --> 09:43.193
about making an honest woman
of my daughter.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.660
Yeah, Dad, put down the nachos.

09:47.696 --> 09:48.887
Stand up, tuck in your shirt,

09:48.922 --> 09:50.755
do it nice.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.049
Fine. Pops.

09:53.084 --> 09:55.109
Excuse me. What did you call me?

09:55.145 --> 09:57.695
( Rueful chuckle )

09:57.730 --> 10:01.349
- Mr. King.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:01.384 --> 10:04.193
Would you please do me the honor

10:04.229 --> 10:06.746
of giving me your
daughter's hand in marriage?

10:06.781 --> 10:09.257
I don't know. I'm not sure
you're the right man for her.

10:09.292 --> 10:11.242
You were sure 20 years ago.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.370
Actually, I wasn't,
but I got outvoted.

10:14.406 --> 10:15.897
- Are you kidding me?
- Dad.

10:15.932 --> 10:18.082
Before I answer,

10:18.118 --> 10:20.735
where do you see yourself
in 20 years?

10:20.770 --> 10:23.687
Not on my knees, begging you
to marry my own wife.

10:23.723 --> 10:26.240
I don't like your attitude,
not-so-young man.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.103
Didn't like it then,
don't like it now.

10:30.138 --> 10:30.737
I'm not sure you're
good enough for my daughter.

10:30.772 --> 10:33.189
I may not be good enough,

10:33.224 --> 10:34.966
but all her clothes
are already here,

10:35.001 --> 10:38.052
so can we wrap this up?

10:38.088 --> 10:40.241
Dad, you are asking for the love
of your life's hand in marriage.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.682
You are not ordering
a taco from a taco truck.

10:42.759 --> 10:44.194
And if he did get a taco,
it'd probably just end up

10:44.218 --> 10:46.469
all over his sweatpants.

10:46.504 --> 10:48.421
Is that a yes?

10:48.456 --> 10:51.366
I don't know. I'm not sure

10:51.401 --> 10:53.329
I like the idea of my daughter
marrying a spy. It's dangerous work.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.144
You better say yes, old man,

10:55.180 --> 10:56.996
or you're gonna see dangerous.

10:57.032 --> 10:59.691
Are you threatening El Dorado?

11:03.071 --> 11:05.955
Pops, just give him a break.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.207
All right, take her.
She's yours.

11:08.242 --> 11:09.901
That was so romantic.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.145
Oh, man, I forgot to record it.

11:12.180 --> 11:13.540
Can you guys do that
one more time?

11:20.071 --> 11:22.480
Look, my parents deserve
the best wedding money can buy,

11:22.516 --> 11:24.665
but I am not paying extra
for pigs in a blanket.

11:24.701 --> 11:26.784
I don't even eat the pigs.
I just need the blankets.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.611
You have got to bring
the cost down.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.180
No, absolutely not.

11:31.215 --> 11:33.541
Cutting the Viennese
dessert table is not an option.

11:33.577 --> 11:35.902
It is a must-have.

11:35.979 --> 11:37.859
Like the fireworks
and the horse-drawn carriage.

11:38.815 --> 11:40.239
Come on, give me
your best price.

11:40.274 --> 11:42.758
What is the bottom line?

11:42.793 --> 11:46.521
Mm-mm, that is
way too many commas.

11:46.556 --> 11:50.508
Fine. Cancel Michael Bubl.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.761
Wow. Planning a wedding
isn't stressful at all.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.880
It's gonna be all worth it.

11:55.957 --> 11:58.082
Actually, I'm really excited
about this wedding.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.876
Oh, George. George, over here.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.748
Thank you.

12:05.784 --> 12:09.285
Uh, you're now receiving
your online shopping deliveries

12:09.321 --> 12:12.505
in the cafeteria?

12:12.541 --> 12:14.974
I didn't wanna be rude
and do it during French class.

12:15.009 --> 12:18.386
I'm assuming that is a present
for my parents' wedding.

12:18.421 --> 12:20.288
No, the invitation said
no gifts.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.307
Actually, it didn't.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.816
Well, mine did.
I penciled it in.

12:27.322 --> 12:30.014
This is my new outfit
for work today.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.360
Adam has seen
all my other clothes.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.226
I don't know how much longer
me and my mom's credit card

12:34.262 --> 12:36.412
can keep this up.

12:36.447 --> 12:39.081
Here's an idea, Marisa.
Don't keep it up.

12:39.116 --> 12:42.343
Either he likes you for you
or he doesn't.

12:42.379 --> 12:43.856
No amount of cute outfits in
the world's gonna change that.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.939
Sh. Not in front of the clothes.

12:46.975 --> 12:50.368
Marisa, there's only
one way to know for sure.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.470
You're right. Tell him
I'm moving to Argentina,

12:52.505 --> 12:54.288
see if he visits me
during spring break.

12:54.323 --> 12:58.133
Okay, there's only
two ways to know for sure.

12:58.169 --> 13:00.403
But before you ship him
off to South America,

13:00.438 --> 13:02.739
let's try my idea first.

13:02.774 --> 13:04.707
Just show up to work
with greasy hair,

13:04.743 --> 13:07.143
no makeup, and your
plain most boring outfit.

13:07.178 --> 13:09.612
Why can't I just
move to Argentina?

13:09.648 --> 13:10.621
Marisa, think of it as a test.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.449
A love test.

13:13.484 --> 13:16.786
Fine. But why is your solution
to everything to take a test?

13:18.415 --> 13:21.099
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.750
Let your man get that.

13:25.589 --> 13:27.421
For milady.

13:27.457 --> 13:29.298
Here comes the choo-choo.

13:29.334 --> 13:32.426
Thanks. I'm not hungry anymore.

13:32.462 --> 13:34.128
I gotta go stop by the library.

13:34.163 --> 13:35.847
Stop right there!

13:43.089 --> 13:45.264
Milady.

13:45.299 --> 13:47.550
Why'd you do that?

13:47.585 --> 13:49.744
So you don't get
your shoes dirty.

13:49.779 --> 13:52.755
Well, I could've just
walked around it,

13:52.790 --> 13:55.207
like a normal person.

13:55.242 --> 13:56.450
Anyway, call me later.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.509
Hey, Akina.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.353
It's later.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.089
So... how you doing?

14:17.573 --> 14:20.483
What did those roses
ever do to you?

14:20.518 --> 14:23.152
Watch and learn, Judy.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.305
I am setting the stage
for the perfect proposal.

14:25.340 --> 14:27.506
Dad will say something romantic,

14:27.541 --> 14:28.552
Mom will cry,
and then they'll kiss.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.792
And then I'll vomit.

14:30.828 --> 14:31.948
Just keep it off the petals.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.975
Hey, KC, what did
those roses ever do to you?

14:38.010 --> 14:39.518
I am setting
a romantic atmosphere

14:39.553 --> 14:41.620
for you to propose to Mom.

14:41.655 --> 14:44.306
Propose? Oh, honey,
this whole wedding thing

14:44.342 --> 14:46.509
- is getting out of control.
- And expensive.

14:46.544 --> 14:49.211
Hey, I cancelled Michael Bubl.

14:49.246 --> 14:51.530
There is nothing left
to scale back on.

14:51.565 --> 14:53.708
I demand a proper proposal.

14:53.743 --> 14:55.301
Like a dog with a bone.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.914
All right, stand in the middle.

14:59.949 --> 15:01.866
Now hold hands.
Hold hands, go ahead.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.492
There we go.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.688
Judy, lights to position two.

15:10.035 --> 15:13.152
All right, now, Dad,
three, two, one. Dazzle us.

15:16.232 --> 15:18.399
So Kira, what do you say we...

15:18.434 --> 15:20.777
Wait!

15:20.812 --> 15:22.995
You need to get down
on one knee.

15:23.030 --> 15:27.082
Child, I am not getting
down on one knee.

15:27.117 --> 15:29.251
If he does, he might not
get back up again.

15:31.089 --> 15:33.714
Good point.

15:33.749 --> 15:35.411
- Honey, why don't you crouch a little?
- For you.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.585
What is wrong with you people?

15:37.620 --> 15:39.011
I am trying to make this wedding

15:39.047 --> 15:40.713
as memorable as the first one.

15:40.748 --> 15:42.381
Please. Who remembers that day?

15:42.416 --> 15:43.916
It's all a blur.

15:43.952 --> 15:46.143
Excuse me?

15:48.297 --> 15:50.022
You don't remember
our wedding day?

15:55.697 --> 15:58.739
Not really.

15:58.775 --> 16:00.792
It was a long time ago, baby.

16:00.868 --> 16:03.051
I mean, do you at least
remember what you said to me

16:03.087 --> 16:05.304
after I walked down the aisle?

16:05.339 --> 16:07.882
Of course.

16:07.917 --> 16:10.259
I said, "Is that
what you're wearing?"

16:10.295 --> 16:11.301
( laughing )

16:11.337 --> 16:13.679
Oh.

16:13.714 --> 16:15.506
So what, this is just
a big joke to you?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.174
Uh, Judy, back to one, please.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.339
You said that you would
never forget that moment,

16:21.363 --> 16:23.398
but apparently, you have.

16:23.474 --> 16:24.902
Sweetie, are you gonna make
a big deal outta this?

16:24.926 --> 16:26.768
Are you gonna remember it
if I do?

16:26.803 --> 16:28.894
Uh, first song.

16:28.929 --> 16:30.596
You guys have not picked
a first song yet.

16:30.631 --> 16:31.717
The most important day
of our lives

16:31.741 --> 16:34.008
meant nothing to you.

16:34.043 --> 16:36.610
Any song will do.
Anything but Michael Bubl.

16:36.646 --> 16:38.713
Kira, enough is enough.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.015
"Enough Is Enough."

16:41.050 --> 16:42.169
I've never heard that one,
but you know what?

16:42.193 --> 16:43.984
If you like it, I like it, too.

16:44.019 --> 16:45.820
Enough is enough?

16:45.855 --> 16:48.630
For your information, Craig,

16:48.666 --> 16:50.694
I happen to remember every detail
like it happened yesterday.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.718
Baby, this is silly.

16:52.753 --> 16:55.154
You know what? If it's so silly,

16:55.189 --> 16:57.034
then why don't we just
call the whole thing off?

16:57.058 --> 16:58.435
- If that's what you want, fine.
- Fine!

16:58.459 --> 17:00.342
Thank you, KC.

17:02.371 --> 17:03.804
Yeah. Thanks a lot, KC.

17:07.993 --> 17:11.362
Well, he didn't say
anything romantic,

17:11.397 --> 17:13.731
they didn't kiss,
but she sure did cry.

17:24.527 --> 17:26.810
Hello.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.196
Is something wrong?

17:29.231 --> 17:31.182
Oh, no.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.076
Everything is great.

17:34.112 --> 17:36.863
Except me and Adam
are no longer a couple.

17:36.898 --> 17:39.147
Oh. I'm really sorry about that, Marisa.
What happened?

17:39.183 --> 17:40.949
I'll tell you what happened.

17:40.985 --> 17:43.044
I took your advice.

17:43.079 --> 17:45.062
I didn't dress up for work,

17:45.097 --> 17:46.772
I didn't wash my hair,

17:46.807 --> 17:48.324
I didn't put on makeup,

17:48.359 --> 17:50.009
and I wore overalls.

17:50.044 --> 17:53.812
That's right. Overalls.

17:53.848 --> 17:56.131
What happened?
He broke up with you

17:56.166 --> 17:56.840
because he thought
you looked terrible?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.434
No. Worse.

17:59.470 --> 18:01.920
He told me that I have
never looked cuter.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.265
And how is that a bad thing?

18:04.300 --> 18:06.867
How am I supposed
to date someone

18:06.902 --> 18:09.453
who does not appreciate
my fabulous sense of style,

18:09.488 --> 18:12.214
and how much work I put
into looking good.

18:12.249 --> 18:14.825
It's over. Thanks a lot, KC.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.378
Thanks a lot, KC.

18:17.413 --> 18:19.905
What did I do?

18:19.940 --> 18:21.824
Thanks to you, Akina's
no longer interested.

18:21.859 --> 18:23.292
And how is that my fault?

18:23.327 --> 18:25.086
You were the one
who told me to act

18:25.121 --> 18:26.695
like this may never
happen again.

18:26.731 --> 18:27.579
And guess what. Now it won't.

18:27.615 --> 18:29.874
Look, relax, okay?

18:29.909 --> 18:30.952
If you want my advice
on how to get her back...

18:30.976 --> 18:33.502
No. Keep your advice
to yourself.

18:33.537 --> 18:36.063
- You're a jinx. A love jinx.
- That is ridiculous.

18:36.099 --> 18:39.082
Doesn't sound ridiculous to me.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.435
You know what?
There is nothing sadder

18:41.471 --> 18:43.165
than two people who blame
their failed relationships

18:43.189 --> 18:44.455
on someone else.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.615
If you want my advice...

18:45.650 --> 18:47.616
BOTH: We don't!

18:50.087 --> 18:51.353
Stay away from her, you two.

18:51.389 --> 18:52.713
She's a love jinx.

18:52.749 --> 18:54.039
A love jinx!

18:58.888 --> 19:00.821
CRAIG: Hey, here's a proposal.

19:00.856 --> 19:02.957
How about you
sleep on the couch?

19:02.992 --> 19:04.792
So is fighting like
cats and dogs

19:04.827 --> 19:06.602
a part of romance?

19:06.637 --> 19:09.555
They're not fighting.

19:09.590 --> 19:12.625
Dad is just, you know, trying
to make things unpredictable.

19:12.660 --> 19:14.384
That is how you keep
romance alive.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.162
KIRA: I could sleep on
the kitchen counter

19:17.197 --> 19:18.684
with the disposal running,
and it would still be quieter

19:18.708 --> 19:21.600
than your snoring.

19:21.636 --> 19:23.911
And Mom is just offering
him some feedback

19:23.946 --> 19:26.538
on a possible health issue.

19:26.573 --> 19:29.041
Okay, who am I kidding?

19:29.076 --> 19:31.893
Ernie's right, I'm a love jinx.

19:31.929 --> 19:32.870
But you know what? I have got
to fix things with my parents.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.105
Watch and learn.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.999
( Clears throat )

19:37.035 --> 19:39.067
Mom, quick. I need your help.

19:39.103 --> 19:41.512
Twisted my ankle.

19:41.547 --> 19:44.498
Ow. A couple more "W's." Send.

19:44.533 --> 19:47.551
Dad, Ernie's trying
to cook again.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.512
- KC, I got your text.
- Ernie, get away from the oven.

19:52.908 --> 19:55.776
I see your ankle's all right.

19:55.812 --> 19:58.571
Uh-uh. Guys.

19:58.648 --> 20:00.689
You need to talk to
each other and work this out.

20:00.725 --> 20:03.558
I have nothing to say
to this man.

20:03.594 --> 20:06.728
And this man has nothing
to hear from that woman.

20:06.764 --> 20:08.375
Guys, you should not
be fighting like this.

20:08.399 --> 20:09.840
This isn't you.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.458
Look, it's my fault.

20:11.493 --> 20:13.143
I got upset when I realized

20:13.178 --> 20:14.581
you guys weren't
technically married,

20:14.605 --> 20:16.663
because out of
all the people in the world,

20:16.698 --> 20:18.235
you guys are
the perfect married couple.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.301
You're the perfect parents.

20:20.378 --> 20:22.164
I think of building a life
with someone one day,

20:22.188 --> 20:24.496
and I want my marriage
to be just like yours.

20:24.531 --> 20:26.949
The only reason I wanted to have
this big, beautiful ceremony

20:26.984 --> 20:28.867
is 'cause I love
and respect you guys so much.

20:28.902 --> 20:31.729
I just wanted you guys
to have cake

20:31.764 --> 20:32.897
and dresses and a party.

20:32.932 --> 20:36.467
I wanted everything to be
just like the first day

20:36.502 --> 20:38.344
you walked down the aisle.

20:38.379 --> 20:40.054
And I wanted it
to mean something.

20:40.089 --> 20:43.399
It meant something
the first time.

20:43.434 --> 20:45.834
The moment I saw your mother
walk down that aisle,

20:45.870 --> 20:49.045
I knew in my heart
I was hers forever.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.741
You gave me that little wink.

20:51.776 --> 20:53.917
You remembered.

20:53.952 --> 20:56.020
Of course I remembered.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.030
It was the best moment
of my life.

20:58.065 --> 20:59.940
The moment my life
truly started.

20:59.975 --> 21:01.983
That's exactly what
you said that day.

21:02.019 --> 21:04.169
Oh, right. Gotcha.

21:10.661 --> 21:13.086
Kira.

21:13.122 --> 21:17.599
I have loved loving you
these past 20 years,

21:17.635 --> 21:19.101
and I don't intend to ever stop.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.797
Will you marry me... again?

21:23.833 --> 21:25.983
I will.

21:30.614 --> 21:32.614
See that?
Dad said something romantic,

21:32.649 --> 21:34.249
and now they're kissing
just like I said.

21:36.036 --> 21:37.953
Judy, are you crying?

21:40.182 --> 21:44.793
No. My orbital socket
is leaking.

21:44.829 --> 21:47.338
It's a... manufacturer's defect.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.654
Dearly beloved,

21:55.690 --> 21:58.040
we are gathered here today,

21:58.075 --> 22:00.059
against my better judgment,

22:02.872 --> 22:06.173
Heck of a turnout.

22:06.208 --> 22:08.659
Look, a guy just got
arrested here.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.936
Technically,
it's still a crime scene.

22:10.972 --> 22:15.232
Kira, do you take Craig
to be your husband,

22:15.267 --> 22:19.327
knowing everything
you already know?

22:19.363 --> 22:21.997
- Daddy. I do.
- Oh.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.309
- Craig.
- Yes.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.986
Do you take Kira to make you

22:28.021 --> 22:29.980
the luckiest man on Earth?

22:30.015 --> 22:34.301
I do, I definitely do.

22:34.336 --> 22:36.136
Oh.

22:38.674 --> 22:41.258
Then by the power vested in me,

22:41.293 --> 22:44.019
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

22:46.290 --> 22:47.731
( Watch chiming )

22:47.766 --> 22:49.867
Uh-oh.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.169
Looks like we're gonna
have to honeymoon in Luxemburg.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.404
We just got a mission.

22:53.439 --> 22:55.180
- Kids.
- Bye.

22:55.216 --> 22:57.942
- Pops.
- Yeah.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.318
I didn't know you were ordained.

22:59.353 --> 23:00.405
Did you do it over the internet?

23:00.429 --> 23:03.188
Ordained over the internet?

23:03.223 --> 23:05.143
No. I just repeated what
people always say on TV.

23:07.369 --> 23:10.437
Then that means
they're not really married.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.075
Someone grab a minister. We're
moving this party to Luxemburg.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.424
Let's go.

23:15.461 --> 23:18.019
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
