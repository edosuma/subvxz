00:17.060 --> 00:18.192
PAIGE:
Oh, come on,

00:18.366 --> 00:19.715
seriously.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.064
It is the same story
with all the books.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.544
None of them deserve

00:22.718 --> 00:24.024
to be banned!

00:24.198 --> 00:25.677
I suppose you want
another naked Godiva

00:25.851 --> 00:27.157
riding out of the book again?

00:27.331 --> 00:28.680
Is that what this
is all about--

00:28.854 --> 00:30.160
Godiva?

00:30.334 --> 00:31.683
It's just an excuse,
and he knows it.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.859
He's using it
to push his own agenda,

00:34.034 --> 00:36.079
which is to stifle freedom
of speech!

00:36.819 --> 00:38.560
[stifled cry]
Ha!

00:38.734 --> 00:40.736
That's what I call stifling.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.477
That is uncalled for.

00:42.651 --> 00:43.956
You give her her mouth back
right now!

00:45.741 --> 00:47.830
Why you little worm,
I should...

00:48.004 --> 00:49.005
MONKEYSHINES:
Little?!

00:49.179 --> 00:50.180
Did you hear that?

00:50.354 --> 00:51.616
She's a size-ist!

00:51.790 --> 00:52.704
What? I...

00:52.878 --> 00:53.879
PAIGE:
Okay.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.794
Miss Donovan, would you please

00:55.968 --> 00:57.274
just give us a moment, okay?

00:57.448 --> 00:59.581
[sighs]

01:01.409 --> 01:04.716
It's always the ones
you least expect.

01:04.890 --> 01:09.417
Professor, please,
you have to understand.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.201
She is a librarian.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.116
Books are
her life.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.422
Besides, I don't think
she's wrong.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.467
None of these books
are dangerous.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.427
Crossed, Double-Crossed?

01:19.601 --> 01:20.819
This doesn't even look magical.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.299
Just look at the cover.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.432
It's filled with violence,
I'm sure!

01:24.606 --> 01:27.043
You haven't even read that?

01:27.217 --> 01:28.653
Didn't waste my time.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.220
It's garbage!

01:30.394 --> 01:31.569
Are you kidding me?

01:31.743 --> 01:34.137
The '30s were a fabulous era.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.358
Okay, drama, passion,
intrigue...

01:37.532 --> 01:39.403
Uh, excuse me, Paige.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.405
Sorry...
could I talk to you a minute?

01:41.579 --> 01:43.015
Just a minute.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.321
Professor,

01:44.495 --> 01:46.671
the next time
you attempt

01:46.845 --> 01:48.586
to ban books,

01:48.760 --> 01:51.328
how about you attempt
reading some?

02:14.743 --> 02:16.614
Thank you for saving me
from that little gnome.

02:16.788 --> 02:17.920
I was about to
strangle him.

02:18.094 --> 02:19.617
You're welcome.

02:19.791 --> 02:22.446
How'd you like to return
the favor by say, uh,

02:22.620 --> 02:24.100
babysitting tonight?

02:24.274 --> 02:25.319
Um...

02:25.493 --> 02:26.711
mm...

02:26.885 --> 02:28.191
no.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.584
That's all I do here, Leo,
I babysit.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.368
I babysit the students,
I babysit teachers,

02:31.542 --> 02:32.978
I babysit.Come on, Paige,please?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.763
It's the only way
Piper will go out with me--

02:34.937 --> 02:36.765
if I can get somebody
to watch the kids.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.723
You asked Piper out,
and she said yes?

02:38.897 --> 02:41.683
Well, I haven't actually
asked her out yet.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.075
She's been
a little

02:43.250 --> 02:44.425
unapproachable lately.

02:44.599 --> 02:45.991
Maybe it's because

02:46.166 --> 02:47.428
you've kind of done this
miraculous turnaround?

02:47.602 --> 02:48.516
Maybe you
should just

02:48.690 --> 02:49.865
ease into things a little.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.214
Well, that's why the date.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.607
Phoebe's been helping me
plan it out.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.130
She's given me some tips.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.479
Come on, please?[sighs]

02:55.653 --> 02:57.220
I really don't want to...

02:57.394 --> 02:58.917
I just don't. I...Thanks. You're
the best!

Miss Donovan,
are you sure

04:15.211 --> 04:17.996
you didn't hear anything,
see anything?

04:18.170 --> 04:19.433
No, and I...

04:19.607 --> 04:23.001
I came and he was
lying there... dead.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.351
Okay.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.396
What is so strange
about this

04:26.570 --> 04:28.703
is that Magic School
is meant to be protecting.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.662
Nobody can get killed here,
let alone with bullets.

04:31.836 --> 04:35.666
Well, well, it did
happen before... once.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.233
What?! What happened?

04:37.407 --> 04:39.366
Well, about 20 ago,
there were two students--

04:39.540 --> 04:41.150
brothers-- one of them
killed the other.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.283
Maybe it's him.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.590
Okay, let's
make this fast.

04:46.764 --> 04:47.939
I've got a city
of lonely people

04:48.113 --> 04:50.202
and I'm playing Cupid.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.117
Oh, Miss Donovan,
why are you crying?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.772
It's one of our
teachers, he...

04:54.946 --> 04:56.078
Oh, did he break your heart?

04:56.252 --> 04:57.688
Well, you called
the right person.

04:57.862 --> 04:58.776
I can handle this.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.387
No...
Shh!

05:00.561 --> 05:02.606
Cupid works alone.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.043
Now, did he hurt you?

05:05.217 --> 05:06.784
I know, I know
it hurts,

05:06.958 --> 05:08.656
but you can't
give up on love.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.875
It could be the biggest
mistake you ever make.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.921
Now, I could fix you up
with one of my readers

05:13.095 --> 05:15.053
because I'm doing this
series in my newspaper

05:15.227 --> 05:16.490
where I'm playing
matchmaker.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.405
I actually have one
in mind for you.

05:18.579 --> 05:19.884
No.
Wait.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.104
He didn't break her heart,
he was murdered.

05:22.278 --> 05:24.541
[whimpering]
Oh.

05:26.108 --> 05:27.457
Why didn't you
tell me that?

05:29.111 --> 05:31.461
I tried to, but
Cupid shushed me.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.377
Miss Donovan,
until we figure out

05:34.551 --> 05:36.292
what is going on here
or who did this,

05:36.466 --> 05:37.641
nobody can leave
the school.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.295
I didn't kill him.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.776
Then I'm sure you
won't mind staying

05:41.950 --> 05:43.081
until we figure
out who did.

05:43.255 --> 05:45.301
Crystals, circle.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.575
Let's go talk in
the other room.
Okay.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.144
So, what do you think,
Nancy Drew?

06:02.318 --> 06:03.624
A lover's quarrel?

06:03.798 --> 06:05.539
Hardly, she hated
him; everybody did.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.585
That means the entire
school is suspect.

06:11.327 --> 06:14.199
Wait, a gnome was shot?

06:14.374 --> 06:16.071
That seems awfully human,
doesn't it?

06:16.245 --> 06:19.248
Yeah. I'd say we're definitely
out of our league.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.858
We don't do bullets.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.251
We need to call the police.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.209
Did you try Darryl?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.689
I tried, he hung up on me again.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.169
Look, the way he feels
about magic,

06:27.343 --> 06:28.779
he's not coming here
any time soon.

06:28.953 --> 06:31.042
So I guess we're on our own.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.130
We could try Kyle?

06:32.304 --> 06:34.698
What, Brody?

06:34.872 --> 06:37.353
You want to tell Brody
about the Magic School now?

06:37.527 --> 06:39.007
There isn't going to be
a Magic School if the Elders

06:39.181 --> 06:41.052
find out that there was
a murder on my watch,

06:41.226 --> 06:42.532
so we need to solve this fast.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.273
Yeah, but Brody?

06:44.447 --> 06:45.666
Kyle!

06:45.840 --> 06:48.233
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I really am.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.105
And I tried, I did.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.715
But I don't trust him.

06:51.889 --> 06:52.847
Therefore,
I'm gonna continue

06:53.021 --> 06:54.501
calling him Brody
and you can

06:54.675 --> 06:56.590
call him Kyle because you
have a crush on him.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.201
I do not have a crush on him.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.204
My interest is
strictly professional.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.641
Right.

07:04.815 --> 07:08.123
Listen, I am the head mistress
of this school, okay?

07:08.297 --> 07:09.864
So I decide, and I trust him.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.649
I need him to do
the CSI part of this.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.738
Can you please get Piper,
check The Book,

07:14.912 --> 07:16.479
and you do the magical part.

07:16.653 --> 07:19.874
Oh, what about the whole date
I planned for Piper?

07:21.397 --> 07:22.485
Did Leo tell you
about the roses?

07:22.659 --> 07:24.444
The roses are great.Home!

07:24.618 --> 07:25.619
It's a great idea.
She's going...

07:46.248 --> 07:47.858
All right!

07:48.032 --> 07:49.033
What's going on?

07:49.207 --> 07:50.339
LEO:
Do you like them?

07:51.645 --> 07:52.776
Leo...

07:52.950 --> 07:54.996
what if somebody saw this?

07:55.170 --> 07:56.345
I sensed.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.001
There's nobody here.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.656
Nobody except the most
beautiful woman in the world.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.788
[chuckles]

08:05.920 --> 08:07.748
You been on top
of the bridge again lately?

08:07.922 --> 08:09.271
'Cause I'm telling you,
there is not

08:09.445 --> 08:11.578
enough oxygen up there.

08:11.752 --> 08:12.796
It's not that.

08:14.145 --> 08:17.279
I-I'm just starting to see
things more clearly now.

08:18.628 --> 08:22.458
And the thing I see
most clear is you.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.940
I want us to
start over again.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.812
Uh...

08:28.986 --> 08:32.512
like right now?

08:32.686 --> 08:33.643
As in today?

08:33.817 --> 08:34.731
Well, why wait?

08:34.905 --> 08:36.559
Look, I'm
not asking

08:36.733 --> 08:38.866
for much, just... have
dinner with me tonight.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.258
Uh... I can't.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.870
Who's gonna watch the kids?Paige.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.915
And don't worry about the club.
Rex said he can handle it.

08:45.089 --> 08:48.092
You talked to my manager
before you talked to me?

08:48.266 --> 08:50.138
Well, I wanted your
mind to be at ease.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.792
Yeah, that's not really working.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.319
Don't you want to
be with me again?

08:57.493 --> 09:00.017
No...

09:00.191 --> 09:02.324
look, of course I do,
it's just...

09:02.498 --> 09:03.847
It's just what?

09:04.021 --> 09:05.849
It's just different, you know.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.547
I've spent months
trying to keep you

09:07.721 --> 09:09.200
from falling
into this psychotic abyss,

09:09.374 --> 09:11.289
and-and now
that you're fine,

09:11.463 --> 09:13.291
I can't just flip a switch
and be all lovey-dovey.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.771
It doesn't work that way.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.513
[phone rings]

09:20.734 --> 09:22.562
Hello?

09:22.736 --> 09:24.694
Yeah, okay,
I'm on my way.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.827
What?

09:27.915 --> 09:29.177
They're beautiful, Phoebe.

09:29.351 --> 09:30.700
Now stay out of it.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.049
[hangs up phone]She's just trying to help.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.399
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I know.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.924
Look, Leo...

09:37.098 --> 09:39.013
I appreciate the gesture, I do.

09:39.187 --> 09:40.405
And I'm not saying no.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.885
I'm just saying...

09:43.191 --> 09:44.496
...I need some time.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.021
I understand.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.335
The roses...

09:58.380 --> 10:00.121
...are lovely.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.863
But you could
do so much more

10:03.037 --> 10:04.778
with our collective powers.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.693
What's the point
if I don't get Piper back?

10:08.738 --> 10:09.913
I thought
we had shown you

10:10.087 --> 10:12.002
the point, Leo.

10:12.176 --> 10:15.353
A world beyond
good and evil,

10:15.527 --> 10:18.574
a world without
conflict.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.054
Without Piper.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.664
In time,
she may return.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.885
But for now,
you must embrace

10:25.059 --> 10:26.451
your new life
as an Avatar...

10:27.801 --> 10:29.498
...and help the sisters
into the fold.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.675
[door opens]

10:32.849 --> 10:34.068
BRODY:
Come on in.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.900
Wow, obsess much
about the Avatars?

10:40.074 --> 10:41.553
Yeah, it's, uh...
pretty much all I've been able

10:41.728 --> 10:42.903
to think about since I found out

10:43.077 --> 10:44.600
what they were called.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.123
Yeah, I've been waiting
for a break

10:46.297 --> 10:47.690
like this for a while.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.387
Did you find out anything
new about them?

10:49.561 --> 10:51.781
No, not really.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.392
Just, um, you know, pieces.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.090
Not enough to figure out

10:56.264 --> 10:59.746
how to find them
or, you know, what they want.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.269
Um...

11:01.443 --> 11:02.705
when's the last time
you got out of here?

11:02.879 --> 11:04.794
Oh, I don't know,
a couple of days.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.753
Oh, well, how about, um,
coming out with me

11:06.927 --> 11:08.798
and getting some
nice fresh air?No, thanks.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.626
You know, I really think
I should, um...

11:10.800 --> 11:13.673
I think that you should come
with me and, um, focus

11:13.847 --> 11:15.675
on something equally mysterious.

11:15.849 --> 11:16.980
Yeah, like what?

11:17.154 --> 11:18.416
Like a murder mystery?

11:18.590 --> 11:19.766
We could really

11:19.940 --> 11:20.941
use your help.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.551
Paige, come on.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.031
I mean, you know I didn't come
here for that.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.293
I know.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.990
But if you help us,

11:27.164 --> 11:29.993
I can let you take a little peek
at Magic School.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.042
All right, talk to me.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.391
Okay, well just
so you know,

11:36.565 --> 11:37.827
the flowers were
totally Leo's idea.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.786
It was just my idea
to get a lot of them

11:39.960 --> 11:42.223
and to have you walk in...I was talking
about the gnome,

11:42.397 --> 11:43.354
not the husband.

11:43.528 --> 11:44.965
Oh, right, of course.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.618
Um, well, according
to The Book,

11:46.793 --> 11:49.273
they don't have any natural
enemies, but as a species,

11:49.447 --> 11:51.449
they tend to piss people off.

11:51.623 --> 11:52.842
But you said he was shot.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.801
Who would shoot a gnome?

11:54.975 --> 11:56.541
And why is the "G" silent?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.195
That's a really good question.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.328
I think the fact

12:00.502 --> 12:02.156
that he was shot
in Magic School

12:02.330 --> 12:03.853
is what worries Paige
the most.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.246
I don't blame her.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.856
The boys aren't still
there, are they?

12:07.030 --> 12:09.119
No, she brought them back;
they're taking their naps.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.513
I'm just getting
really tired of this.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.776
Oh, don't worry; we'll
figure out who killed him.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.518
No, not the gnome,
the husband.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.215
Oh. I can't keep up.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.000
He's just trying
to reconnect with you.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.653
You know that, right?

12:21.828 --> 12:23.264
Oh. I know, I do.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.658
And I would like
to do that as well.

12:26.833 --> 12:30.793
Just... I don't know, I
can't help but think...

12:30.967 --> 12:32.142
Your guard's up.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.928
Yeah, and...

12:35.102 --> 12:37.191
You want to lower it,
you just can't.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.106
And still, I...

12:39.280 --> 12:40.368
Feel vulnerable.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.805
And you don't want
to get hurt again.

12:42.979 --> 12:47.157
Uh... could I possibly have a
chance to express my feelings?

12:47.331 --> 12:49.072
Oh, yeah, sure, go ahead.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.118
I don't know what to do.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.075
I mean, he's
been great.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.903
He's been really great,

12:54.077 --> 12:58.690
and he's totally changed,
but I can't help but feel...

13:00.083 --> 13:02.172
...that something's
just not right.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.913
It's too good to be true.

13:05.306 --> 13:09.397
But then... I can't just shut up
and be happy, right?

13:15.707 --> 13:17.666
Well, it's about time.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.450
Sorry. Sorry we
took so long.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.975
Who's this?Uh,

13:22.149 --> 13:24.194
Agent Brody,
Homeland Secur... oh!

13:27.241 --> 13:29.286
Ooh, sorry, forgot
to warn you about that.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.418
[groans]

13:30.592 --> 13:32.637
You okay?No, I'm not.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.426
So what is she,
like a demon, warlock, what?

13:38.600 --> 13:39.514
DONOVAN:
No.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.037
I'm a librarian.

13:41.211 --> 13:42.778
And a suspect,

13:42.952 --> 13:44.214
unless you say
otherwise.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.436
All clear.

13:52.875 --> 13:56.618
Yeah, just checking.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.663
All right,

13:58.838 --> 14:00.361
if you could, uh...

14:00.535 --> 14:02.102
hold out your hands
for me, please.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.017
Why? What are you gonna do?

14:04.191 --> 14:06.541
Well, if you fired
a gun recently,

14:06.715 --> 14:07.759
this will show
the residue.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.677
I'm telling you,
it had to be the Mullen boy.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.201
Who?

14:14.375 --> 14:15.855
Eddie Mullen.
I remembered his name now.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.073
The kid who shot his brother

14:17.247 --> 14:19.162
20 years ago here.

14:19.336 --> 14:23.340
Okay, but how and why
would this person come back?

14:23.514 --> 14:24.907
I don't know.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.867
Well, she's,
she's clean.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.433
She couldn't
have done it.

14:29.607 --> 14:30.695
Thank you.
PAIGE:
Sorry about that.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.480
Can you do me
a huge favor?

14:32.654 --> 14:34.874
Find out everything you can
about the Mullen brothers

14:35.048 --> 14:36.397
and, um,

14:36.571 --> 14:37.746
keep it quiet,
'cause I really don't want

14:37.920 --> 14:39.269
the Elders to find out.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.488
Very well.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.794
Thanks.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.842
Where's the body?

14:48.931 --> 14:52.413
Whoa, all these books
on magic?

14:52.587 --> 14:54.067
Yes, they are.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.591
Any of them
on the Avatars?

14:56.765 --> 14:59.986
I don't know, but
I'll let you look
at all of them

15:00.160 --> 15:02.727
if you can help
me out with this.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.903
Oh.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.166
What is he?

15:06.340 --> 15:09.169
He's a gnome and
one of my teachers.

15:09.343 --> 15:10.431
A gnome, great.

15:10.605 --> 15:11.867
So now I suppose
you're gonna tell me

15:12.041 --> 15:14.087
that leprechauns
and fairies exist now, too?

15:14.261 --> 15:16.785
Oh, well, actually, yeah.Never mind.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.787
I can only take
so much at a time.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.796
Well, the body was moved.

15:27.970 --> 15:28.840
He wasn't shot here.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.233
How do you know?

15:30.407 --> 15:34.585
There's no blood spatter
on the floor.

15:34.759 --> 15:37.066
Crossed, Double-Crossed...

15:38.154 --> 15:42.071
...by the Mullen...
the Mullen Brothers.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.334
Mullen Brothers?

15:47.381 --> 15:49.252
It's not finished.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.081
Huh.

15:52.255 --> 15:55.650
"The streets were quiet
after Shorty died.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.740
"Too quiet."

15:58.914 --> 16:01.177
Shorty...

16:02.265 --> 16:03.440
Close the book.

16:03.614 --> 16:06.226
What? Why?

16:14.625 --> 16:16.062
What happened?
Where are we?

16:16.236 --> 16:17.628
[horn blaring]
Whoa.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.285
Oh, God, I think
we got sucked into the book

16:22.459 --> 16:23.547
just like the gnome.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.809
Sucked into the book?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.202
Oh, yeah, don't worry.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.682
Magical things happen
to us all the time,

16:27.856 --> 16:30.424
but this is the first time
in black and white.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.992
Yeah, black and w--

16:33.166 --> 16:34.428
How are we in
black and white?

16:34.602 --> 16:36.256
Paige, what the hell
is going on here?

16:36.430 --> 16:37.909
MAN:
Well well, what
do we have here?

16:38.084 --> 16:39.650
A couple of newcomers.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.174
Oh, man, you got
to be kidding me.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.610
You pals of Shorty's?

16:42.784 --> 16:44.307
Oh, the gnome.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.787
Let me handle this.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.832
Yeah, maybe we are.
What's it to you?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.617
Don't get wise with me, legs.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.185
You're here for
the same reason
that Shorty was.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.796
Looking for the Falcon,
ain't you?

16:54.970 --> 16:56.189
Well, it belongs to Johnny.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.799
Hey, look guys,
I think you got us

16:57.973 --> 16:59.279
confused with
somebody else.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.455
Nah, I don't think so.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.502
[guns firing]

17:05.676 --> 17:06.764
Orb us out of
here, Paige!

17:06.938 --> 17:08.201
I can't!
My powers don't work!

17:08.375 --> 17:10.594
Just run!
Come on, run!

17:27.002 --> 17:28.047
You turned me
into a felon.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.179
You know that, right?

17:30.353 --> 17:31.615
Breaking and entering,
vandalism,

17:31.789 --> 17:33.269
theft.

17:33.443 --> 17:35.445
It's a fictional store
in a fictional world.

17:35.619 --> 17:36.751
I highly doubt

17:36.925 --> 17:37.926
we're breaking any laws.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.449
May be a fictional world,

17:39.623 --> 17:41.495
but those bullets seemed
pretty damn real to me.

17:41.669 --> 17:46.021
Yeah, well, that's precisely
why we need to blend in

17:46.195 --> 17:47.066
before those goons

17:47.240 --> 17:48.937
come to get us again.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.765
Are you peeking?

17:50.939 --> 17:53.768
Nope. Are you?

17:55.900 --> 17:57.946
Look, do we have any chance
of getting out of here

17:58.120 --> 18:00.296
like the gnome did, only alive?

18:00.470 --> 18:01.819
I don't know, I
think the book

18:01.993 --> 18:04.474
expelled him
after he was killed.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.911
Same thing must have happened
to the Mullen boy.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.217
Wait a minute, I thought...

18:08.391 --> 18:09.740
I thought he was killed
by his brother.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.438
Well, I think
everybody
thought that

18:11.612 --> 18:13.788
'cause they disappeared
at the same exact time.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.965
Maybe he's still here.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.140
Well, we gotta find him then.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.794
I mean, if he wrote the thing,

18:19.968 --> 18:21.665
he's gotta know how
to get out of here, right?

18:21.839 --> 18:23.885
Although if he does know,
why wouldn't he have left?

18:24.059 --> 18:26.409
I mean, it's been 20 years.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.628
I don't know.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.238
I don't know,
but if we find him,

18:29.412 --> 18:31.110
maybe he can, uh,
you know, he can...

18:33.982 --> 18:34.983
We can, uh...

18:36.289 --> 18:38.943
Wow, you look great.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.728
Thank you.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.904
Do I look like Lana Turner?

18:43.078 --> 18:46.647
Right out of The Postman Always
Rings Twice...good version.

18:52.827 --> 18:55.656
You know, um...

18:55.830 --> 18:59.138
you may not blend in very well
in that outfit there, Lana.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.618
Well, I'm thinking as
long as we're down here,

19:01.792 --> 19:03.620
we might as well
have some fun.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.535
Yeah, well you have fun.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.581
I'm going
to just survive.

19:07.755 --> 19:08.756
Here it is-- Mullen.

19:08.930 --> 19:09.974
[sirens wail in distance]

19:10.149 --> 19:11.759
You think they're coming
after us?

19:11.933 --> 19:13.761
I don't think we
should stick around
and find out.

19:13.935 --> 19:14.762
Come on,
out the window.

19:14.936 --> 19:15.806
Let's go.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.765
I got it.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.249
Go around back,
try and pinch 'em.

19:24.380 --> 19:25.903
Think they're
after the Falcon?

19:26.077 --> 19:27.731
Isn't everybody?

19:27.905 --> 19:31.431
But if they think they're
gonna get it before we do,

19:31.605 --> 19:32.997
they got another
thing coming.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.831
I'm telling you,
I don't know where Paige is.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.269
I haven't seen her since she
sent me to get these files.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.531
But you were her
prime suspect.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.402
How did you get
out of the cage?

19:46.576 --> 19:49.666
Well, she let me out after
her cop friend exonerated me.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.146
Darryl?

19:51.320 --> 19:52.234
Brody.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.279
She brought him here?

19:53.453 --> 19:54.541
He wanted
to see the body.

19:54.715 --> 19:57.239
That's why they came this way.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.414
That's odd.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.416
What's odd?

20:00.590 --> 20:02.766
That book, it's been moved.

20:07.423 --> 20:08.381
[shrieks]

20:14.604 --> 20:15.736
PIPER:
What?

20:15.910 --> 20:17.085
What did you see?I saw Paige

20:17.259 --> 20:19.435
on the best seller list.

20:19.609 --> 20:20.654
She's in this book.

20:20.828 --> 20:21.698
They both are.

20:21.872 --> 20:22.830
Well, what
do you mean?

20:23.004 --> 20:24.571
Well, open it up, get 'em out.

20:24.745 --> 20:25.876
No, I can't.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.444
What if it sucks us
in there, too?

20:28.618 --> 20:29.576
Oh, God, we need Leo.

20:29.750 --> 20:30.881
Leo?

20:31.926 --> 20:33.580
Look, Piper,
I know you need time,

20:33.754 --> 20:35.756
but I don't
think we have it.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.540
At least Leo will be able
to sense them

20:37.714 --> 20:38.585
and make sure they're okay.

20:38.759 --> 20:39.890
All right, all right.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.457
Okay.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.503
Uh, but we should
do this at home

20:43.677 --> 20:45.722
in case we need The Book of
Shadowsto get them out.

20:45.896 --> 20:46.941
Can you watch
Wyatt and Chris?

20:47.115 --> 20:48.072
Oh, sure, of course.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.509
Oh, but take these.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.858
They're the Mullen brothers'
school records.

20:51.032 --> 20:51.859
It might help.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.339
The Mullen brothers?

20:53.513 --> 20:54.601
Who are they?

20:54.775 --> 20:55.906
They're dicks.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.952
[laughing]:
Dicks.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.214
No, like private
eyes, detectives.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.172
Don't you see?

21:01.347 --> 21:02.870
They wrote themselves
in as the heroes
of their own books

21:03.044 --> 21:05.916
like Sam Spade or
Philip Marlowe.

21:09.833 --> 21:13.663
Oh, sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.752
The newcomers?

21:15.926 --> 21:18.625
Eddie, I thought you said
you didn't know 'em.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.714
Um, I don't.

21:20.888 --> 21:23.107
I-I never seem 'em before
in my life.
BRODY:
Wait a minute.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.413
You're Eddie?

21:24.587 --> 21:25.806
You got a problem with that?

21:26.894 --> 21:30.463
No, we were just
expecting somebody older.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.334
You like
older, toots?

21:33.422 --> 21:35.032
You ought to take a gander
my way.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.904
Hey, why don't you gander
somewhere else, buddy?

21:38.079 --> 21:39.863
Who are you?

21:40.037 --> 21:43.954
My name's Johnny,
Johnny the Gent.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.739
I think you made
the acquaintance

21:45.913 --> 21:47.088
of a few of my boys.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.959
Johnny, right.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.396
Yeah, I think
they dropped your name

21:50.570 --> 21:51.788
in between
tommy gun blasts.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.224
[chuckles]

21:53.399 --> 21:55.401
A simple misunderstanding.

21:55.575 --> 21:57.707
Everyone's on edge
on account of the Falcon.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.710
The Falcon as in
The Maltese Falcon?

22:00.884 --> 22:03.844
Nah. Everyone knows
the Maltese was a fake.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.759
This one's the real deal.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.369
The Burmese Falcon.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.502
[chuckles]
Burmese.
You can't be serious.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.068
It's a total rip-off.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.592
Yeah, well,
rip-off or no,

22:12.766 --> 22:14.463
I figure that's
why you're here.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.900
You wouldn't happen to know
where it is, would you?

22:17.074 --> 22:18.337
Maybe we do.

22:18.511 --> 22:21.078
But that's between us and Eddie.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.951
We have business to discuss.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.256
Alone.

22:25.431 --> 22:26.780
Thanks, I got enough business.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.216
No, please,

22:28.390 --> 22:30.261
you're the only one
who can help us.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.394
See, we, uh...

22:32.568 --> 22:34.048
we came from your school.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.312
We just can't seem
to find our way back.

22:39.662 --> 22:42.230
JOHNNY:
Be polite, Eddie.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.014
Hear 'em out.

22:44.188 --> 22:46.582
Besides, it, uh,

22:46.756 --> 22:48.758
might be lucrative.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.853
I'll be in touch.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.771
EDDIE:
Of all the books

23:01.945 --> 23:04.470
in all the libraries
in all the world,

23:04.644 --> 23:06.907
you got to get sucked
into this one?

23:16.220 --> 23:18.658
BRODY:
You don't seem too happy
to see us.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.182
Well, should I be?

23:21.356 --> 23:23.184
PAIGE:
What are you doing?

23:23.358 --> 23:24.968
Don't you know those
things'll kill you?

23:25.142 --> 23:29.277
Well, if the smokes don't
get me, the bullets will.

23:29.451 --> 23:30.670
Just like they
got your brother?

23:30.844 --> 23:33.281
BRODY:Look, what
happened, Eddie?

23:33.455 --> 23:35.370
Who killed him?

23:38.068 --> 23:40.506
It was, uh,
a couple corrupt cops.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.290
They were trying to stop him

23:42.464 --> 23:44.640
from getting to the Falcon
before they did.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.468
The Falcon--
what is it with this Falcon?

23:46.642 --> 23:48.035
Why does everyone
want it so badly?

23:48.209 --> 23:50.341
'Cause we wrote 'em that way,
that's why.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.169
It's their whole motivation.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.954
[exhales]:
Very impressive.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.304
Quite a magical world
you boys have concocted here.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.785
You must've been
very advanced students.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.265
Nah, Dan was the creative one.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.791
It was his idea;
I was just along for the ride.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.923
It was supposed to be fun.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.621
So why haven't you left yet?

24:09.709 --> 24:11.754
I can't.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.756
The only way out
is to end the story.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.715
Can't do that
until the Falcon's found.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.499
You don't know where it is?

24:17.673 --> 24:22.417
No, Dan and I laid down
the fundamentals, the beginning.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.332
The story's got a life
of its own now.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.116
So what have you been doing
for the last 20 years,

24:26.290 --> 24:27.814
sitting on your ass?

24:27.988 --> 24:29.642
20 years?

24:29.816 --> 24:32.209
No. Dan just died yesterday.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.298
No, not on the
outside, he didn't.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.952
You guys have created

24:36.126 --> 24:37.345
some sort of different time
in here,

24:37.519 --> 24:40.304
one where no one ages,
apparently.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.743
No, they just get killed...

24:43.917 --> 24:45.135
thanks to me.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.833
All right,
this is ridiculous.

24:47.007 --> 24:47.877
All right, look...

24:48.051 --> 24:49.488
[phone rings]

24:50.619 --> 24:54.188
This is Eddie,
hold the line please.

24:54.362 --> 24:56.233
Uh, would you all mind?

24:56.407 --> 24:58.192
Yeah, no problem.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.065
All right, go ahead, Johnny.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.241
[door closes]

25:04.415 --> 25:06.505
Nah, they don't know anything
about the Falcon,

25:06.679 --> 25:09.899
but, uh, I think they're going
to be trouble anyways.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.249
I'm telling you, he knows
more than he's letting on.

25:12.423 --> 25:13.599
He's hiding something.

25:13.773 --> 25:16.036
Yeah, he's hiding
pain, real pain.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.125
I don't think
that's supposed to
be part of the story.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.953
So what
if he feels guilty?

25:20.127 --> 25:21.345
It doesn't mean he didn't
kill his brother.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.695
We could be next.

25:22.869 --> 25:26.829
Look, I know an
innocent, okay?

25:27.003 --> 25:29.092
I think the only way
for us to get out of this

25:29.266 --> 25:31.138
is to figure how
to help him first.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.662
I mean...

25:33.836 --> 25:35.621
Good news.

25:35.795 --> 25:38.406
That was an anonymous source,
gave me a lead on the Falcon.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.277
Oh, that's great,
that's great.

25:40.451 --> 25:43.106
So what, you just happened
to get this tip just now?

25:43.280 --> 25:44.760
You guys coming here

25:44.934 --> 25:46.370
must have triggered the story
to move forward.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.285
If we find the Falcon,
we can get out.

25:48.459 --> 25:49.330
Isn't that what
you want?

25:49.504 --> 25:50.505
Yeah, of course.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.551
Isn't that
what you want?

25:53.595 --> 25:54.944
Yeah. Sure.

25:55.118 --> 25:58.034
Um, I'll go get my car.

25:58.208 --> 26:00.646
I hope you know
what you're doing.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.082
[door closes]

26:02.256 --> 26:04.388
What... what are you...
what is it?

26:04.563 --> 26:05.912
It's strange,

26:06.086 --> 26:09.219
I almost feel as if
someone's calling to me.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.787
Paige is still alive in there,
I don't know about Kyle.

26:11.961 --> 26:14.529
Wait, you're calling him
Kyle now, too?

26:14.703 --> 26:16.139
Well, that's his
name, isn't it?

26:16.313 --> 26:19.229
I knew she should not have
gotten him involved in this.

26:19.403 --> 26:20.404
This is a bad idea.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.623
I'm sure it's his fault.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.103
Forget about whose
fault it is.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.757
We need to get
them out of there

26:24.931 --> 26:26.715
without getting
trapped ourselves.

26:26.889 --> 26:28.761
Maybe I can help.

26:28.935 --> 26:29.892
What are you doing?

26:30.066 --> 26:31.764
It's all right, I'll be okay.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.332
[grunts]

26:35.506 --> 26:36.420
Leo.

26:50.478 --> 26:51.522
You must have
shorted it out.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.220
How did you do that?

26:53.394 --> 26:56.571
I guess I'm just a little more
focused now.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.921
What is it doing?

26:59.095 --> 27:03.012
It looks like it's writing
itself, as if it were

27:03.186 --> 27:05.841
unfolding right now.

27:06.015 --> 27:09.279
Is that...
Paige and Brody?

27:09.453 --> 27:10.498
And who's driving?

27:10.672 --> 27:12.239
Uh, Eddie Mullen,I think.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.937
Listen: "Riding in Eddie's
car, Lana and the Fed..."

27:15.111 --> 27:16.591
"Lana and the Fed"?

27:16.765 --> 27:18.114
Hey, at least he's
not calling him Kyle.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.376
Know what I mean?[laughs]

27:19.550 --> 27:21.335
"Lana and the Fed

27:21.509 --> 27:24.425
had no idea they were being
driven straight into a trap."

27:24.599 --> 27:25.644
He's setting them up.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.080
Yeah, well, what
do you expect?

27:27.254 --> 27:29.082
It's called Crossed,
Double-Crossed.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.085
What are you doing?

27:32.259 --> 27:34.174
I am trying my hand
at being a novelist.

27:34.348 --> 27:37.568
See of I can write in a little
twist to help Paige out.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.833
Uh... "Then, suddenly...

27:41.007 --> 27:43.966
they got a flat tire."

27:46.055 --> 27:47.578
[loud pop]

27:49.580 --> 27:51.017
What the hell was that?

27:51.191 --> 27:52.845
It's a flat tire,
but I don't understand.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.455
That's impossible.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.675
Why, you can't get a flat tire
in your book?

27:56.849 --> 27:59.852
No, it's too cliché.

28:00.026 --> 28:02.593
Okay, who put it in there?

28:04.291 --> 28:05.553
Whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

28:05.727 --> 28:07.120
Well, it's just up
around the corner.

28:07.294 --> 28:08.164
We can get
there on foot.

28:08.338 --> 28:09.209
Oh, come on,
you're lying.

28:09.383 --> 28:10.732
Ease up.He's lying.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.821
Eddie, I want some answers,
and I want 'em now.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.867
[sirens wailing]

28:15.998 --> 28:18.697
I think you got
your answer.

28:23.049 --> 28:25.965
We were wondering
what's taking so long, Eddie.

28:26.139 --> 28:27.444
We've been waiting.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.055
Eddie, what's going on?

28:30.186 --> 28:32.754
I'm sorry to do
this to you,

28:32.928 --> 28:34.887
really I am,
but, uh...

28:35.061 --> 28:37.280
you see, this story
can never end.

28:40.806 --> 28:41.850
"The couple knew
they'd been double-crossed,

28:42.024 --> 28:43.634
and there was no way out."

28:55.690 --> 28:56.778
Nope, this one's
not working either.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.127
Try this one.

28:58.301 --> 28:59.868
The pens are fine.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.652
The book's just not letting you
write them out of it.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.219
Yeah, but why not?

29:03.393 --> 29:05.134
PIPER:
Well, maybe
it's against the rules.

29:05.308 --> 29:07.920
I don't know,
the book is writing itself,

29:08.094 --> 29:10.661
well, maybe they have
to save themselves.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.011
Then why was I able

29:12.185 --> 29:13.752
to write in the flat tire?

29:13.926 --> 29:17.581
It was just another plot twist,
which we could add...

29:17.756 --> 29:19.845
but we can't bail them out.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.542
Heroes have to be heroes.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.631
I read a lot.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.024
Yeah, I know you do.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.765
Maybe you should get out
a little more.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.462
Easy, Cupid.

29:28.636 --> 29:30.159
All right, maybe you ought to
focus on the book,

29:30.333 --> 29:31.595
maybe there's something
in the prose that can help.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.381
In the prose, yes,
let me check the prose, Leo.

29:35.425 --> 29:38.733
Actually, there is something
in chapter 10.

29:38.907 --> 29:42.824
Eddie says the only way out
is to find the Falcon.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.174
So all we have to do
is find the Falcon?

29:45.348 --> 29:48.961
Yeah, before the book
spits out two more corpses.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.353
Okay, let's go talk
to the parents

29:50.527 --> 29:52.442
and see if they know
anything about the book.

29:52.616 --> 29:56.577
You be creative and just
keep Paige and Brody alive.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.622
Oh, okay, right.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.537
No pressure.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.110
[groans]

30:08.284 --> 30:11.070
Tell me all you know
about the Falcon.

30:11.244 --> 30:14.160
I told you,
I don't know anything.

30:14.334 --> 30:15.465
No?

30:15.639 --> 30:17.903
Gee, why don't
I believe you?

30:18.077 --> 30:19.121
[blow lands, Brody cries out]

30:19.295 --> 30:20.427
Kyle...

30:20.601 --> 30:22.124
You're not going
anywhere, sweetheart.

30:22.298 --> 30:24.387
Now unless you want
him to end up

30:24.561 --> 30:26.128
with a bullet
in his ear,

30:26.302 --> 30:28.565
you'll tell us
where the Falcon is.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.741
Understand?

30:30.916 --> 30:32.918
Get your paws off of me.

30:33.092 --> 30:34.571
[wry laugh]

30:34.745 --> 30:38.706
So tell me, what's a cute
little package like you

30:38.880 --> 30:41.622
doing mixed up with that
no-good Fed in there?

30:45.452 --> 30:48.107
Femme fatale.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.631
Flirt with him, Paige,
flirt with him.

30:56.550 --> 30:57.943
Come on, sister,

30:58.117 --> 31:00.075
don't you know how
to play the game?

31:00.249 --> 31:02.861
"Sister"?

31:03.035 --> 31:04.253
You're a little heartbreaker,
aren't you?

31:05.515 --> 31:07.778
A regular femme fatale.

31:10.303 --> 31:13.088
Maybe I am...
maybe I'm not.

31:13.262 --> 31:16.091
Maybe I'm just crazy...
crazy for cops,

31:16.265 --> 31:17.658
tough cops,

31:17.832 --> 31:19.355
the kind of cops
that'll arrest your heart

31:19.529 --> 31:22.619
and make you long
for a life sentence with 'em.

31:24.534 --> 31:28.016
You know any cops
like that?

31:28.190 --> 31:29.583
[grunts]

31:29.757 --> 31:31.324
We can keep this up
all night if you like,

31:31.498 --> 31:33.456
or you can tell me
where the Falcon is,

31:33.630 --> 31:34.675
and I'll end it but quick.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.111
[groans]

31:36.285 --> 31:37.808
Is that supposed to be a choice?

31:37.983 --> 31:40.724
Yeah. Either you die fast
or you beg for death,

31:40.899 --> 31:43.553
but either way, I'm getting
the Falcon out of you first.

31:43.727 --> 31:44.772
Kyle!

31:46.426 --> 31:47.427
[grunts]

31:54.608 --> 31:55.739
You all right?

31:55.914 --> 31:57.524
I'll live.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.047
How'd you get in here?

31:59.221 --> 32:00.962
Well, I seduced a cop,
grabbed his gun,

32:01.136 --> 32:02.746
and knocked him out,
all thanks to Phoebe.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.226
Phoebe?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.141
Getting a little magical
help from my sisters.

32:06.315 --> 32:08.143
That's the whole
flat tire thing,

32:08.317 --> 32:09.840
they were warning us
about the trap.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.146
Doesn't matter.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.801
You're right,
Eddie's not an innocent.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.411
Actually I think
that you were right.

32:15.585 --> 32:16.935
I think that he is.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.023
Come on, I'll
explain on the way.

32:18.197 --> 32:20.025
We've got to find him.

32:20.199 --> 32:23.028
Mrs. Mullen,
if this is too difficult...

32:23.202 --> 32:25.595
No, no, no,
I'm all right.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.162
I-I wanted to meet here.

32:27.336 --> 32:28.685
I miss coming here.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.951
So you said something
about another shooting?

32:33.125 --> 32:34.256
Yes.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.737
Well, you don't
think Eddie...

32:36.911 --> 32:38.043
No, of course not.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.609
Well, good.

32:39.783 --> 32:42.221
Because he didn't kill
his brother, either,

32:42.395 --> 32:44.049
no matter what anybody says.

32:44.223 --> 32:45.267
He'd never do that.

32:45.441 --> 32:46.747
He loved Danny.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.967
And you haven't heard
from Eddie in...

32:49.141 --> 32:50.055
MRS. MULLENS:
In over 20 years.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.404
No.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.145
But...

32:53.319 --> 32:56.017
believe it or not, his father
and I still have hopes

32:56.191 --> 32:59.629
that, um, someday,
somehow...

32:59.803 --> 33:01.588
he'll come back to us.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.329
Sometimes it's

33:03.503 --> 33:05.461
the only thing that keeps us
from falling apart.

33:05.635 --> 33:06.985
Crazy, huh?

33:08.812 --> 33:11.380
Do you have
any children?

33:11.554 --> 33:13.339
Yeah, we

33:13.513 --> 33:14.905
have two boys, too.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.298
Oh.

33:16.472 --> 33:17.908
Well, you treasure

33:18.083 --> 33:19.258
every moment together,

33:19.432 --> 33:20.781
hmm?

33:20.955 --> 33:22.957
Um, we were just wondering...

33:23.131 --> 33:26.047
Did the boys ever mention
writing a book together?

33:26.221 --> 33:28.093
What does that have
to do with anything?

33:28.267 --> 33:30.138
Uh, we're not sure yet.

33:30.312 --> 33:31.922
Do you know anything
about the book?

33:32.097 --> 33:33.446
Well, not much.

33:33.620 --> 33:34.751
They never let us see

33:34.925 --> 33:36.623
anything.

33:36.797 --> 33:39.147
Yeah, but I know
it was Dan's idea.

33:39.321 --> 33:43.195
Yeah, I know he wanted
to help Eddie with it.

33:43.369 --> 33:44.674
Help him how?

33:44.848 --> 33:48.504
To believe in
himself, to feel...

33:48.678 --> 33:50.115
confident.

33:51.246 --> 33:52.334
To be a hero?

33:52.508 --> 33:55.511
Yes, probably.

33:55.685 --> 33:58.427
Then he has to finish the story.

33:58.601 --> 33:59.733
Which means we need

33:59.907 --> 34:02.431
to help Paige help him.

34:04.607 --> 34:05.956
This is ridiculous,
I don't know why

34:06.131 --> 34:07.175
we're going
to get Eddie.

34:07.349 --> 34:08.524
He's beyond hope.But didn't you

34:08.698 --> 34:09.917
hear him apologize
when he turned us in?

34:10.091 --> 34:11.571
Criminals don't say
they're sorry.

34:11.745 --> 34:14.313
Yeah, and innocents don't
try to get you killed.

34:14.487 --> 34:15.705
Hey, Paige.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.098
I know that kid.

34:17.272 --> 34:18.230
I was that kid.

34:18.404 --> 34:19.883
Look, after

34:20.058 --> 34:21.755
my parents died, I fell
in with the wrong crowd, too.

34:21.929 --> 34:23.191
I was scared, lost.

34:23.365 --> 34:24.975
I thought I was to blame
for what happened.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.630
I felt that way too, but I
didn't try to hurt anybody.

34:27.804 --> 34:28.849
I did.

34:29.023 --> 34:31.765
Relatives,
social workers, cops,

34:31.939 --> 34:33.593
I'd do anything
to push them away,

34:33.767 --> 34:35.638
all because I didn't think that
I was worthy of being helped.

34:35.812 --> 34:37.466
Maybe Eddie feels
the same way.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.381
Maybe, but I think
he crossed the line.

34:39.555 --> 34:40.948
Not necessarily.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.819
See, I think Johnny the Gent
got him to set us up.

34:42.993 --> 34:43.907
He's playing Eddie.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.431
But what Eddie
doesn't know

34:45.605 --> 34:47.085
is that Johnny is the one
that killed his brother.

34:47.259 --> 34:48.608
I thought the cops killed him.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.827
No, it's classic noir,
that's just a red herring.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.438
If the cops did it,
they would have

34:52.612 --> 34:54.092
beaten Eddie until he told
them where the Falcon was,

34:54.266 --> 34:55.310
but they're still
looking for it.

34:55.484 --> 34:56.964
So the gangsters killed Dan?

34:57.138 --> 34:58.357
Who else would it be?

34:58.531 --> 35:00.881
So then maybe we need
to end the story

35:01.055 --> 35:03.449
by collaring the gangsters.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.320
All right, let's go,
they're back this way.

35:05.494 --> 35:06.930
Well, hold on, what about Eddie?

35:07.105 --> 35:08.541
Eddie's the hero
of the story

35:08.715 --> 35:10.456
so he must know
where the Falcon is.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.936
LEO:
But he blames himself for what
happened to his brother.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.243
Paige has to get him to
see it's not his fault.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.941
So he has the confidence
to finish the story.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.682
You guys are a great team.

35:19.856 --> 35:21.467
Match-make later.

35:21.641 --> 35:22.685
Save sister now.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.034
You need

35:24.209 --> 35:25.732
to get Paige to Eddie.

35:25.906 --> 35:28.300
I can't, she's going
after the gangsters.

35:28.474 --> 35:29.736
What? She's going
to get herself killed.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.259
Well, Kyle is trying

35:31.433 --> 35:33.435
to stop her,
but she won't listen to him.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.829
Wait, when did I take his side?

35:36.003 --> 35:36.960
Probably around
the time

35:37.135 --> 35:38.788
you started calling him Kyle.

35:38.962 --> 35:39.920
LEO:
Try and block

35:40.094 --> 35:41.487
her path.

35:44.925 --> 35:47.145
You were saying?

35:47.319 --> 35:50.060
Thanks guys, could you
be any less subtle?

35:50.235 --> 35:52.411
Looks like
your sisters agree with me.

35:52.585 --> 35:53.760
Don't gloat.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.805
Let's go get Eddie.

35:59.722 --> 36:01.594
Eddie?

36:02.682 --> 36:04.466
Sorry to disappoint you.

36:05.685 --> 36:06.773
Drop it.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.518
Where's Eddie?

36:12.692 --> 36:14.607
I sent him out to look
for the two of you.

36:14.781 --> 36:17.697
I heard you got away
from the cops.

36:17.871 --> 36:20.743
Too bad you're not going
to get away from me.

36:21.744 --> 36:22.789
Kyle.

36:22.963 --> 36:25.139
Forget about him, sweetheart.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.619
His number's up.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.064
Please, we just want
to get out of here.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.414
That's all, I swear.

36:39.588 --> 36:40.459
Help.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.243
Well, I'm sorry but, uh...

36:42.417 --> 36:44.419
if I get the Falcon
out of Eddie...

36:44.593 --> 36:46.465
I can't leave any
loose ends hanging about.

36:48.597 --> 36:49.816
Now, listen,

36:49.990 --> 36:52.601
in a couple minutes
it's going to be over

36:52.775 --> 36:54.124
for your friend over there.

36:54.299 --> 36:58.128
But you...
you're a knockout.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.782
Please...

36:59.956 --> 37:02.132
don't make me waste
a bullet on you.

37:07.921 --> 37:09.531
What's going on here?

37:09.705 --> 37:11.620
Eddie, I didn't
expect you so soon.

37:11.794 --> 37:14.362
They, uh, they came
looking to get even.

37:14.536 --> 37:15.450
For you settin' em up.

37:15.624 --> 37:16.843
That's not true.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.236
He killed my friend
in cold blood

37:18.410 --> 37:19.585
just like he killed
your brother.

37:19.759 --> 37:22.109
What... what are you
talking about?

37:22.283 --> 37:23.980
Don't listen
to her, Eddie.

37:24.154 --> 37:25.417
You know the cops
killed your brother,

37:25.591 --> 37:27.549
you know that.That's not true.

37:27.723 --> 37:28.942
You didn't see it,
did you, Eddie?

37:29.116 --> 37:30.248
It's just a story

37:30.422 --> 37:31.727
that Johnny's
been telling you.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.599
Don't you see, he's
been playing you.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.731
He tried to force Dan into
giving him the Falcon

37:35.905 --> 37:37.516
but he wouldn't
give it up.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.258
So now he's trying to
charm you out of it.That's it.

37:40.432 --> 37:41.911
Say goodnight, Gracie.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.261
[sighs]

37:43.435 --> 37:44.305
What the hell?

37:44.479 --> 37:46.133
Thank you.

37:46.307 --> 37:48.918
I could use a
flashback right now.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.442
Flashback.

37:50.616 --> 37:51.747
She wants a flashback.

37:51.921 --> 37:53.183
Why?

37:53.358 --> 37:54.228
To prove Johnny killed
Eddie's brother.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.708
But we don't know that,

37:55.882 --> 37:57.579
and we can't make it up;
the book won't let us.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.712
It will if
it's true.

37:59.886 --> 38:03.498
"Then Eddie found out
how Dan really died.

38:03.672 --> 38:06.501
It was as if it was
happening all over again."

38:14.248 --> 38:17.382
I know you found
the Falcon, Danny.

38:17.556 --> 38:18.731
What the hell?

38:18.905 --> 38:20.341
Now, you better
tell me where it is

38:20.515 --> 38:21.255
if you know
what's good for you.
No,

38:21.429 --> 38:22.778
you can'tkill me.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.432
I made you.

38:27.435 --> 38:28.480
Never mind.

38:28.654 --> 38:29.829
I'll get it from
your brother

38:30.003 --> 38:31.178
one way or the other.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.008
Sucker.

38:37.271 --> 38:39.055
You're not going to believe
that, are you kid?

38:39.229 --> 38:40.622
It's some kind of

38:40.796 --> 38:43.059
smoke and mirrors trick;
it's a picture show.

38:43.233 --> 38:45.061
Paige,

38:45.235 --> 38:46.628
save your innocent.

38:46.802 --> 38:50.458
Eddie, you have to stop
punishing yourself.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.460
This is not your fault.

38:52.634 --> 38:54.680
Your brother would not
want you to live this way,

38:54.854 --> 38:56.595
as if you were in
some kind of prison.

38:56.769 --> 39:00.076
He would want you to...
to grow up, to live your life,

39:00.250 --> 39:02.949
to... become part
of the real world.

39:04.429 --> 39:05.517
[distant sirens wailing]

39:05.691 --> 39:06.648
Cops.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.173
That's it, give me
the Falcon now,

39:10.348 --> 39:11.392
or I will break
her neck.

39:11.566 --> 39:12.698
Don't, it's

39:12.872 --> 39:14.047
your only way out.I'll do it.

39:14.221 --> 39:15.309
All right.

39:15.483 --> 39:16.615
All right,
don't hurt her.

39:16.789 --> 39:17.877
I'll give it to you.

39:18.051 --> 39:19.226
This better not
be a trick, kid.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.010
It's not.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.143
I should have done
this a long time ago.

39:44.773 --> 39:45.948
Where did you find it?

39:46.122 --> 39:48.560
Doesn't matter.

39:48.734 --> 39:51.171
All that matters is
no one else dies because of it.

39:51.345 --> 39:52.564
Let her go.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.479
Give it me, come on,
come on, I got to go.

39:54.653 --> 39:56.263
You can't, this isn't
the way the story is

39:56.437 --> 39:58.221
supposedto end.
Trust me, it is.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.397
Give it to me.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.311
No, no, no.

40:05.751 --> 40:06.882
Wow.

40:07.056 --> 40:07.883
Wow, okay we did it.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.363
We did it.

40:12.714 --> 40:13.889
We did it.

40:14.063 --> 40:15.761
Leo.I got him.

40:24.334 --> 40:25.597
[moans]

40:32.081 --> 40:33.126
Hey...

40:34.606 --> 40:35.476
...you're in color.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.304
We all are.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.914
So, are we having fun yet?

40:39.088 --> 40:40.176
[chuckles]

40:40.350 --> 40:41.700
Hey, where are we?

40:41.874 --> 40:42.831
PIPER:
The story's over.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.616
You're a hero.

40:44.790 --> 40:47.140
Your brother would be
very proud of you.

40:50.186 --> 40:51.884
Yeah, well, what do I do now?

40:52.058 --> 40:53.233
You go home.

40:53.407 --> 40:55.365
Your parents will be
thrilled to see you.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.150
They never gave up on you.

40:57.324 --> 40:58.760
LEO:
Or each other.

41:00.196 --> 41:01.415
PHOEBE:
Don't forget

41:01.589 --> 41:02.764
this.

41:07.203 --> 41:09.467
Hey look, we're novelists.

41:09.641 --> 41:11.381
No, you know what,
you keep it.

41:11.556 --> 41:14.080
Now that it's finished, no one
else will get sucked inside it.

41:16.299 --> 41:18.432
I actually think it belongs in
the library at Magic School.

41:18.606 --> 41:20.565
Speaking of
Magic School,

41:20.739 --> 41:22.175
after you drop off Eddie,

41:22.349 --> 41:23.393
why don't you pick
up the kids and

41:23.568 --> 41:25.265
we can have a
late dinner. Talk.

41:26.309 --> 41:28.050
I'd like that.

41:29.922 --> 41:30.879
Shh.

41:32.925 --> 41:34.317
I guess this is it then.

41:36.711 --> 41:37.930
Thank you.

41:38.104 --> 41:39.409
Stay out of trouble
man, will you?

41:39.584 --> 41:40.976
Bye.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.939
Are you hungry?

41:49.550 --> 41:51.900
Starving.

41:52.074 --> 41:55.382
I think we should go then.

41:55.556 --> 41:57.123
PIPER:
Well, all right, then,
you all go.

41:57.297 --> 41:58.603
See you later.

41:58.777 --> 42:00.430
Lana and the Fed.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.302
Sounds like
a thriller to me.

42:02.476 --> 42:04.130
More like a
romance novel.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.871
Whether we like
it or not.
Mm-hmm.

42:10.571 --> 42:12.007
Remember our deal, right?

42:12.181 --> 42:14.401
I remember there
being talk of a deal.

42:14.575 --> 42:16.882
So I suppose that
you'll find time

42:17.056 --> 42:18.579
to help me with
the Avatars?

42:18.753 --> 42:20.320
I suppose you'll
want to look

42:20.494 --> 42:22.278
at the books
in Magic School.

42:22.452 --> 42:23.932
Suppose I'm
not thinking

42:24.106 --> 42:25.934
about those
books right now.

42:26.108 --> 42:27.806
Suppose I'm hoping

42:27.980 --> 42:30.025
you're not thinking
of those books.

42:30.199 --> 42:32.288
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

42:32.462 --> 42:34.813
I wonder if I...

42:34.987 --> 42:37.293
oh, shut up and kiss me.

42:37.467 --> 42:40.079
