01:08.485 --> 01:10.570
Money, money, money. Hey!

01:17.494 --> 01:20.204
You got a date with justice,
one-Eyed Bart.

01:20.456 --> 01:23.207
Too bad, Sheriff. I 'm a married man.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.377
One-Eyed Betty!

01:42.019 --> 01:43.978
I think you dropped something, mister.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.855
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.440
You've reached the end of the line!

01:47.733 --> 01:49.650
I always wanted to go out with a bang!

01:59.703 --> 02:01.078
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!

02:03.373 --> 02:06.042
Hate to leave early,
but our ride is here.

02:11.006 --> 02:14.091
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.722
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

02:25.312 --> 02:26.521
Hold him steady!

02:32.236 --> 02:33.236
Woody, hurry!

02:54.675 --> 02:55.758
No!

03:04.643 --> 03:06.477
Glad I could catch the train!

03:06.895 --> 03:08.813
Now let's catch some criminals.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.399
To infinity and beyond!

03:28.125 --> 03:30.084
Reach for the sky.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.460
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

03:31.587 --> 03:34.714
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

03:42.973 --> 03:46.475
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.622
Evil Dr. Pork Chop!

04:10.208 --> 04:17.505
That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork Chop to you.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.129
"Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."

04:57.214 --> 04:59.090
"Woody, no. It'll kill you." "Just do it!"

05:03.804 --> 05:06.680
"You're going to jail, Bart."
"Watch out!"

05:08.892 --> 05:09.934
Mom!

05:10.018 --> 05:12.978
No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I 'm not here.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.146
Oh, no, Molly!

05:14.231 --> 05:17.983
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.778
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!

05:20.862 --> 05:24.031
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?

05:25.450 --> 05:27.451
Come on.
Say "Happy birthday" to Molly.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.330
- Happy birthday!
- Charming.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.040
Happy birthday!

05:34.126 --> 05:37.002
- Look how tall you're getting.
- Yeah!

05:44.803 --> 05:47.221
"I came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"

05:47.305 --> 05:48.931
"Got it, Woody."

05:49.599 --> 05:51.767
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

05:53.395 --> 05:55.020
"Good work, Buzz."

06:20.255 --> 06:22.965
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.217
Wait! I can't find my other eye.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.887
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.806
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.100
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?

06:33.185 --> 06:37.521
Yes. No. I mean, why would I mind
squeezing next to you?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.398
Is it hot in here?

06:39.483 --> 06:40.483
Here they come!

06:44.154 --> 06:45.237
Sarge, you got it?

06:45.322 --> 06:46.697
Mission accomplished.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.948
Hooray!

06:49.284 --> 06:51.202
Careful. Careful!

06:53.663 --> 06:56.707
All right, guys. We got one shot
at this. Everyone ready?

06:56.791 --> 06:58.584
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!

06:58.793 --> 07:00.836
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.976
Target is on approach.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.395
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.037
Hello?

07:36.164 --> 07:38.541
Hello? Anyone there?

07:39.668 --> 07:41.335
Molly, stay out of my room!

07:41.419 --> 07:43.546
I wasn't in your room.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.589
Then who was messing with my stuff?

07:45.674 --> 07:47.049
It wasn't me.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.724
Well, that went well.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.769
He held me! He actually held me!

07:59.312 --> 08:00.813
This is just sad.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.315
Who we kiddin'?
The kid 's 17 years old.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.234
We ain't ever gettin' played with.

08:09.281 --> 08:10.656
Guys, hey, hold up.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.409
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!

08:13.493 --> 08:14.660
Not again!

08:15.078 --> 08:17.830
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.248
We are gathered, Woody.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.834
Okay. First off,

08:22.335 --> 08:25.963
we all knew operation Playtime
was a long shot.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.464
More like a misfire.

08:27.591 --> 08:31.510
But we've always said this job isn't
about getting played with. It's about...

08:31.595 --> 08:33.721
Being there for Andy. We know.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.347
But we can try again! Right?

08:37.142 --> 08:39.768
I 'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.020
What?

08:41.104 --> 08:44.607
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.984
We're going into attic mode, folks.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.902
Keep your accessories
with you at all times.

08:48.987 --> 08:52.031
Spare parts, batteries, anything
you need for an orderly transition.

08:52.115 --> 08:55.659
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!

08:55.744 --> 08:58.454
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.623
Yeah, but now it's here.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.042
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...

09:03.126 --> 09:04.460
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?

09:05.337 --> 09:08.172
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.299
- Moving on?
- You're going AWoL?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.177
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.512
And let's face it,
when the trash bags come out,

09:15.597 --> 09:17.264
we army guys are the first to go.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.892
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?

09:20.352 --> 09:24.104
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck, folks.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.232
You're gonna need it.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.068
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

09:29.152 --> 09:31.654
- We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.905
How do you know?

09:32.989 --> 09:35.032
- We're being abandoned!
- We'll be fine, Jessie.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.493
- So why did Sarge leave?
- Should we leave?

09:37.577 --> 09:40.788
- I thought we were goin' to the attic.
- I hate all this uncertainty!

09:40.872 --> 09:42.873
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!

09:42.957 --> 09:46.794
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.

09:46.878 --> 09:50.172
I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.842
- Wheezy and Etch and...
- Bo Peep?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.263
Yeah. Even Bo.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.600
All good toys
who've gone on to new owners.

10:01.685 --> 10:05.354
But through every yard sale, every
spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!

10:06.022 --> 10:08.857
He must care about us,
or we wouldn't be here.

10:09.359 --> 10:13.696
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm...

10:13.780 --> 10:16.156
- And we'll all be together.
- Exactly!

10:16.241 --> 10:18.117
There's games up there,
and books, and...

10:18.201 --> 10:21.161
- The racecar track!
- The racecar track. Thank you!

10:21.246 --> 10:24.623
- And the old TV.
- There you go, the old TV.

10:24.708 --> 10:28.877
And those guys from the Christmas
decorations box. They're fun, right?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.379
Yeah.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.133
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.760
And he'll play with us then, right?

10:36.845 --> 10:38.554
We'll always be there for him.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.890
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready,

10:41.975 --> 10:44.435
and go out on a high note.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.270
I 'd better find my other eye.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.313
Where'd you leave it this time?

10:48.398 --> 10:51.483
Someplace dark. And dusty.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.987
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on eBay.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.699
Don't worry. Andy's gonna
take care of us. I guarantee it!

11:23.808 --> 11:25.768
You guarantee it, huh?

11:25.852 --> 11:28.896
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?

11:29.814 --> 11:32.649
Well, whatever happens,
at least we'll all be together.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.986
For infinity and beyond.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.947
- Can I have your stereo?
- No.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.200
- Why not?
- 'Cause I 'm taking it with me.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.373
- Can I have your computer?
- No.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.709
- Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.503
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.215
Anything you're not taking to college
either goes in the attic, or it's trash.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.301
- Mom, I 'm not leaving till Friday.
- Come on. It's garbage day.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.220
- Mom.
- Look, it's simple.

12:01.304 --> 12:05.599
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.

12:05.683 --> 12:08.185
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.646
Why do you still have these toys?

12:11.189 --> 12:12.731
Molly, out of my room!

12:12.816 --> 12:14.525
Three more days and it's mine!

12:14.609 --> 12:17.027
Molly, you're not off the hook either.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.946
You have more toys
than you know what to do with.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.198
Some of them could make
other kids really happy.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.407
What kids?

12:22.492 --> 12:25.327
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.745
What's daycare?

12:26.830 --> 12:27.955
- Mom.
- No buts.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.792
You choose the toys you want to
donate, I 'll drop them off at Sunnyside.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.304
Poor Barbie.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.681
I get the Corvette.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.225
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.268
Like what?

12:49.352 --> 12:51.270
Like what are you gonna do
with these toys?

12:51.354 --> 12:52.771
Should we donate them
to Sunnyside?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.606
- No.
- Maybe sell them online?

12:54.691 --> 12:56.567
Mom, no one's gonna want
those old toys.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.610
They're junk.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.404
Fine. You have till Friday.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.115
Anything that's not packed for college
or in the attic

13:03.199 --> 13:10.581
- is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.797
- What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot.

14:00.882 --> 14:01.882
That's what's happening.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.190
- You need a hand?
- I got it.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.691
Here.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.526
So, you gonna miss me
when I 'm gone?

14:21.611 --> 14:24.196
- Lf I say no, do I still get your room?
- Nope.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.906
Then, yes, I 'll miss you.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.741
I can't breathe!

14:27.825 --> 14:30.160
- This can't be happening!
- Quiet! What's that sound?

14:41.255 --> 14:42.339
Andy!

14:45.343 --> 14:47.386
That's not trash. That's not trash!

14:47.470 --> 14:49.680
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.058
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!

14:59.273 --> 15:00.691
Okay, boy. To the curb!

15:04.862 --> 15:06.488
No, Buster! No!

15:09.325 --> 15:11.326
Get up. Buster!

15:27.093 --> 15:29.386
- We're on the curb!
- I knew it would come to this!

15:29.470 --> 15:30.971
Pull, everyone! Pull!

15:41.357 --> 15:43.400
- It won't rip!
- Forget it!

15:43.484 --> 15:46.111
It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene!

15:46.195 --> 15:47.320
There's gotta be a way out!

15:47.405 --> 15:49.030
Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

15:49.407 --> 15:50.699
Point. Point. Point!

15:54.370 --> 15:55.787
Push! Push!

15:55.872 --> 15:57.372
I can hear the garbage truck!

15:58.708 --> 16:00.208
It's getting closer.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.080
Buzz! Jessie!

16:47.965 --> 16:50.342
- Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.178
- Junk. He called us junk.
- How could he?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.097
This doesn't make any sense.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.684
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.187
- Sarge was right.
- Yeah, and Woody was wrong.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.856
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.650
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.443
- Should we be hysterical?
- No!

17:08.528 --> 17:10.569
- Yes!
- Maybe! But not right now!

17:12.031 --> 17:14.991
Fellas, I know what to do.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.958
What the heck?

17:23.626 --> 17:26.877
- We should 've done this years ago.
- Jessie, wait. What about Woody?

17:27.505 --> 17:30.006
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.

17:30.633 --> 17:31.883
Now we need to go!

17:33.553 --> 17:34.886
You're right. Come on.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.222
- Buzz?
- Woody!

17:37.306 --> 17:40.392
What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

17:40.476 --> 17:42.477
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.812
We're going to daycare!

17:44.146 --> 17:46.523
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?

17:46.649 --> 17:49.442
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.903
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.822
Attic? So how did we
end up on the curb?

17:53.948 --> 17:56.575
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.827
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.495
And called us junk!

18:00.663 --> 18:03.748
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.750
Sure thing, college boy!

18:07.962 --> 18:09.546
Andy's moving on, Woody.
It's time we did the same.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.008
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

18:13.843 --> 18:16.011
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.347
Woody, wait. We need to figure out
what's best for everyone.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.689
Great. Great! It's gonna take us
forever to get back here.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.451
It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.

18:39.535 --> 18:44.164
Well, Molly and I have been
growing apart for years.

18:44.248 --> 18:48.543
It's just... I can't believe
she would throw me away!

18:49.170 --> 18:51.671
- Welcome to the club, toots.
- Okay, everyone, listen up.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.299
We can get back to Andy's,
but we gotta move fast.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.092
We'll hide under the seats
till we get back home.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.719
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.970
Andy doesn't want us anymore.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.431
He was putting you in the attic!

19:01.515 --> 19:03.516
He left us on the curb!

19:03.601 --> 19:06.353
- All right, calm down! Both of you!
- Okay, fine. Fine.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.063
Just wait till you see
what daycare's like.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.775
- Why? What's it like?
- Daycare is a sad, lonely place

19:11.859 --> 19:15.028
for washed-up old toys
who have no owners.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.783
- Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
- You'll see.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.578
As soon as we get to daycare,
you'll be begging to go home.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.095
Can anyone see anything?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.138
- There's a playground!
- Wow!

19:42.223 --> 19:44.182
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!

19:44.266 --> 19:46.351
So much for sad and lonely, huh?

19:46.435 --> 19:48.686
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.647
Perspective? This place is perfect.

19:50.731 --> 19:54.776
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.240
- Hey there!
- Wow!

20:00.324 --> 20:01.950
Haven't seen you in ages.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.494
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.

20:04.578 --> 20:08.164
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.417
- Say hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.710
Hey, how are your kids?
Molly and Andy?

20:12.795 --> 20:16.047
Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.715
- What?
- Can you believe it?

20:17.800 --> 20:21.386
- You sure they won't miss these?
- No, they never get played with.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.849
- You see any kids?
- Where is she taking us?

20:33.482 --> 20:34.691
- Look!
- Wow!

20:34.775 --> 20:36.401
What? What is it?

20:41.824 --> 20:43.158
No, no, no.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.326
What's the matter with you?

20:46.829 --> 20:48.163
I can't see!

20:48.622 --> 20:50.999
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!

20:56.297 --> 20:58.465
- So now what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.

20:58.549 --> 21:01.342
- Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.928
Careful. These toys might be jealous
of new arrivals.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.180
- I want to see!
- Hey!

21:05.264 --> 21:06.389
- Rex!
- It's my turn!

21:12.271 --> 21:13.521
New toys!

21:19.862 --> 21:21.738
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.656
Buzz Lightyear at your service.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.075
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.456
Thank you. May I?

21:35.169 --> 21:36.878
The claw!

21:43.594 --> 21:47.889
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.

21:48.349 --> 21:52.393
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I 'm Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear.

21:52.937 --> 21:54.979
But please call me Lotso.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.940
Buzz Lightyear. We come in...

21:58.150 --> 22:01.069
First thing you gotta know about me,
I 'm a hugger.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.989
Look at you all. You've been through
a lot today, haven't ya?

22:05.074 --> 22:06.783
It's been horrible.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.827
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.

22:09.912 --> 22:13.456
We been dumped, donated,
yard-saled, secondhanded

22:13.540 --> 22:16.834
and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait,

22:16.919 --> 22:20.505
you'll find being donated was the
best thing that ever happened to ya.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.926
Mr. Lotso, do toys here
get played with every day?

22:25.302 --> 22:27.637
All day long. Five days a week.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.639
But what happens
when the kids grow up?

22:29.723 --> 22:31.516
Well, now, I 'll tell ya.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.852
When the kids get old,
new ones come in.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.397
When they get old,
new ones replace them.

22:37.982 --> 22:42.443
You'll never be outgrown or neglected,
never abandoned or forgotten.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.947
No owners means no heartbreak.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.952
- It's a miracle.
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.495
Because we're Andy's toys!

22:52.579 --> 22:55.540
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

22:55.624 --> 22:58.543
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.795
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
- Now, let's get you all settled in.

23:01.088 --> 23:05.133
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!

23:05.217 --> 23:07.635
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.892
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

23:14.977 --> 23:17.562
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.063
Folks, if you want to step
right this way...

23:28.490 --> 23:30.533
Hi, I 'm Ken.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.745
Barbie. Have we ever met?

23:34.496 --> 23:36.414
I would 've remembered.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.250
- Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.295
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.

23:42.379 --> 23:45.340
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.

23:45.466 --> 23:50.136
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.890
- What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.977
Folks, if I can share,
here at Sunnyside, we've got,

23:58.062 --> 23:59.937
well, just about anything
a toy could ask for.

24:00.022 --> 24:01.814
Spare parts, superglue,

24:01.899 --> 24:05.360
and enough fresh batteries
to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.653
- Think you're gettin' old?
- Wow.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.280
Well, stop your worryin'.

24:09.365 --> 24:13.368
Our repair spa will keep you stuffed,
puffed, and lightly buffed.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.330
And this, well, this is where I live.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.208
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.669
And a whole room
just for trying on clothes.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.506
You have everything!

24:26.590 --> 24:29.467
Everything except
someone to share it with.

24:31.762 --> 24:35.807
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me. Here we are.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.853
Well, thank you, Big Baby.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.023
Why don't you come meet
our new friends?

24:44.483 --> 24:47.944
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together, me and him.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.238
Abandoned by the same owner.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.157
But we don't need owners
at Sunnyside.

24:53.242 --> 24:56.536
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.746
We control our own destiny.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.748
Watch out for puddles.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.419
And here's where
you folks'll be stayin'.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.421
The Caterpillar Room.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.674
- Look at this place.
- Wow!

25:09.758 --> 25:11.801
Holy moly guacamole.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.386
Jackpot, baby.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.263
- Whoa, puppy!
- Hello.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.389
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.268
It's so beautiful!

25:22.312 --> 25:25.565
What the... Hey, little guy.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.025
How long 's it been
since you all got played with?

25:28.110 --> 25:29.152
It's been years.

25:29.611 --> 25:33.448
Well, just you wait. In a few minutes,
that bell's gonna ring,

25:33.532 --> 25:36.367
and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreamin' of.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.287
Play! Real play! I can't wait!

25:39.371 --> 25:42.248
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be headin' back.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.375
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.501
- Thank you.
- Take care, pinky.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.128
- Goodbye, Mr. Lotso. Thank you.
- Thank you, buddy boy.

25:47.212 --> 25:50.381
- Will I see you again?
- I 'll see you tonight

25:50.466 --> 25:51.966
in my dreams.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.385
Ken, let's get a move on.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.888
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.848
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.725
Heck, you don't know me
from G.I. Joe,

26:00.809 --> 26:02.894
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...

26:02.978 --> 26:05.229
- Made for each other.
...made for each other.

26:06.815 --> 26:07.982
- Yay!
- Yes.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.984
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.988
This is so exciting!

26:20.662 --> 26:21.829
Sounds like kids to me.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.374
I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?

26:25.459 --> 26:26.959
How many you reckon are out there?

26:27.044 --> 26:28.836
They sound so sweet.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.513
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

26:39.181 --> 26:41.098
But we need to go home.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.392
We can have
a whole new life here, Woody.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.437
A chance to make kids happy again.

26:46.522 --> 26:49.273
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.608
- Come on, Woodster!
- You'll get played with.

26:50.692 --> 26:51.776
- I can't. No.
- Stay here.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.861
- You can make a new kid happy.
- No, no. Guys, really. No!

26:54.863 --> 26:58.241
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!

26:58.867 --> 27:02.286
And if he wants us at college,
or in the attic,

27:02.371 --> 27:04.080
well, then, our job is
to be there for him.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.624
Now, I 'm going home.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.835
Anyone who wants to join me
is welcome. Come on, Buzz.

27:14.883 --> 27:15.967
Buzz?

27:19.179 --> 27:20.972
Our mission with Andy
is complete, Woody.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.723
What?

27:22.808 --> 27:24.850
And what's important now
is we stay together.

27:24.935 --> 27:28.104
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

27:28.188 --> 27:30.648
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.

27:30.732 --> 27:31.941
Whose name is written there?

27:33.235 --> 27:36.237
Maybe Andy doesn't
care about us anymore.

27:36.572 --> 27:39.073
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!

27:39.157 --> 27:40.825
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.827
You can't just turn your back
on him now!

27:42.911 --> 27:47.039
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!

27:49.960 --> 27:51.919
Okay, fine. Perfect.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.548
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

28:01.597 --> 28:05.766
So this is it?
After all we've been through.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.077
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.333
Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"

28:32.502 --> 28:33.502
Look,

28:34.254 --> 28:38.466
I don't want you left alone
in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.890
Bonnie?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.059
I gotta go.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.230
Bonnie, you in here?

29:13.877 --> 29:16.545
Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.878
What... What the heck?

30:00.465 --> 30:01.716
Now, that's better.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.428
- Bonnie!
- Bluebells, cockleshells...

30:05.512 --> 30:08.514
There you are. Come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.498
No, no, no, no!

31:15.290 --> 31:18.125
Reach for the sky!

31:18.627 --> 31:22.546
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...

31:28.845 --> 31:31.430
You're my favorite deputy.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.808
- Bonnie!
- Coming!

31:37.646 --> 31:38.813
Great.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.868
It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.

31:52.994 --> 31:55.746
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.415
He's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.167
Toys are for playtime.

32:00.502 --> 32:03.254
Speaking of playtime,
they're lining up out there!

32:03.338 --> 32:05.256
- How many?
- There must be dozens.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.590
I can hardly wait!

32:06.675 --> 32:08.092
Places, everyone!

32:22.858 --> 32:24.817
At last! I 'm gonna get played with!

32:25.819 --> 32:27.695
- Rex?
- Come to papa.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.084
'Here's a snake in my boot.

33:25.128 --> 33:29.465
I'd like to join your posse, boys,
but first I'm gonna sing a little song.

33:29.549 --> 33:30.549
A sheriff!

33:32.510 --> 33:34.094
Move over, Mr. Pricklepants.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.889
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?

33:38.058 --> 33:42.937
It's good for you. But don't drink
too much, or you'll have to...

33:43.480 --> 33:45.064
Be right back!

33:46.274 --> 33:48.108
Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.778
Can you tell me where I am?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.279
The guy's just asking a question.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.991
Well, excuse me.
I 'm trying to stay in character.

33:56.993 --> 34:00.037
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.580
Hello, I 'm Trixie.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.959
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
I don't know where I am.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.295
We're either in a café in Paris
or a coffee shop in New Jersey.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.339
I 'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor

34:10.422 --> 34:12.299
with life-changing news.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.594
We do a lot of improv here. Just
stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.722
- No, no, no, no. I...
- Who wants lunch?

34:21.141 --> 34:24.561
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.

34:25.522 --> 34:27.731
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.360
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?

34:36.282 --> 34:40.452
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!

34:41.246 --> 34:42.496
"I know where to hide."

34:46.333 --> 34:48.502
She'll never find us in here.

34:49.379 --> 34:50.838
What's wrong?

34:52.090 --> 34:55.634
She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

34:55.719 --> 34:58.512
- You're doing great!
- Are you classically-trained?

34:58.596 --> 35:00.264
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here!

35:00.348 --> 35:01.724
There is no way out.

35:02.976 --> 35:04.309
Just kidding. Door's right over there.

35:04.394 --> 35:07.438
Well, cowboy, you just
jumped right in, didn't ya? I 'm Dolly.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.856
- Woody.
- Woody?

35:09.065 --> 35:10.607
Really? You're gonna stick with that?

35:10.692 --> 35:13.360
'Cause now's your chance
to change it, new room and all.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.070
That's coming from a doll
named Dolly.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.699
- Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.951
- Well, actually...
- 'Course he's not, pea brain.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.288
- He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have... My hat!

35:24.372 --> 35:26.582
- Told ya.
- I found a spaceship!

35:26.833 --> 35:27.958
Showtime.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.502
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.

35:30.587 --> 35:34.214
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.551
Three, two, one, blastoff!

35:42.098 --> 35:45.559
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.820
I got a kink in my slink.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.825
My tail! Where's my tail?

36:08.249 --> 36:09.583
Someone need a hand?

36:10.627 --> 36:12.044
- Where's my nose?
- Here it is.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.378
- Here's your arm.
- Give me that. That's mine.

36:13.463 --> 36:14.588
Honey, the mustache?

36:14.672 --> 36:17.466
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.844
Andy never played with us like that.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.805
We're just gonna have to
make the best of it.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.681
But these toddlers,
they don't know how to play with us.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.101
- They're too young!
- Yeah, they're sticky.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.769
Well, we should be
in the Butterfly Room.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.437
- With the big kids!
- That's right.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.523
- Yeah, you said it.
- We'll get this straightened out.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.275
I 'll go talk to Lotso
about moving us to the other room.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.697
Blast. Try that one.

36:41.741 --> 36:42.950
It's locked!

36:43.284 --> 36:45.035
- Same here.
- Try the windows.

36:45.453 --> 36:48.038
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.832
Finest childproof lock in the world.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.959
- We're trapped!
- Wait.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.377
Did anyone notice the transom?

36:54.796 --> 36:56.964
Oh, great. How do we get up there?

36:58.842 --> 37:02.469
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...

37:03.054 --> 37:04.346
- Three!
- Whoa!

37:06.474 --> 37:07.641
Let go!

37:19.529 --> 37:20.571
Go!

37:25.493 --> 37:27.286
- He did it!
- Yes, sir!

37:28.246 --> 37:29.788
Way to go, Buzz!

37:32.083 --> 37:35.127
Yeah, you think
they had a fun playtime?

37:35.211 --> 37:36.336
They might hear you.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.924
- Okay, now you start.
- I...

37:41.009 --> 37:42.259
- Love...
- You.

37:42.343 --> 37:44.636
See? That time, I said "love."
Okay, now me first.

37:44.721 --> 37:45.762
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I...

37:45.847 --> 37:47.014
- Love...
- You.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.099
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.893
You are so smart.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.603
Come on, Romeo. We're late.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.980
- I 'll wait up for you.
- Kisses!

38:58.711 --> 39:00.337
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.588
- Come on. Any splits?
- Heya. Bring it here.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.673
- All right.
- Here we go.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.841
- Come on, horsey, come on!
- Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.468
- Gobble, gobble, baby.
- Come on, horsey.

39:06.552 --> 39:07.511
Come on, duck.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.513
- All right, that's it. No more bets.
- Come on! Right here.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.682
Let me have the duck, let me have
the duck, let me have the duck!

39:11.766 --> 39:13.267
Here is a duck.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.519
- I won!
- Ah, man!

39:16.271 --> 39:18.814
- Well, Stretch takes the round.
- You lost!

39:18.898 --> 39:20.524
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.109
- Coyote's wild.
- Here, here.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.694
- Two greens here.
- Changing two double A's.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.904
Hey, what do you guys think
of the new recruits? Any keepers?

39:25.989 --> 39:27.781
Oh, please! Landfill!

39:27.865 --> 39:30.367
- Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.

39:30.451 --> 39:33.287
But that space guy, he could be useful.

39:33.371 --> 39:37.249
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.376
Neither are you, Chunk.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.087
You got a little keeper yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

39:42.171 --> 39:44.673
Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.

39:44.757 --> 39:46.675
Aw, Mr. Softy over here.

39:46.759 --> 39:48.802
What do you expect from a girl's toy?

39:48.886 --> 39:53.098
I 'm not a girl's toy! I 'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?

39:53.182 --> 39:54.808
All them toys are disposable.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.769
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.652
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.071
Let me go!

40:08.364 --> 40:09.823
Take him to the libary.

40:09.907 --> 40:10.949
No!

40:41.856 --> 40:43.899
1225 Sycamore.

40:44.484 --> 40:45.859
Woody, what are you doing?

40:46.861 --> 40:47.903
I gotta get outta here.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.947
- You're leaving?
- But didn't you have fun today?

40:51.032 --> 40:52.783
Well, of course I did,
more than I 've had in years,

40:52.867 --> 40:55.035
but, you see,
I belong to someone else.

40:55.244 --> 40:58.288
- Who's "Yid-nuh"?
- I believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."

40:58.373 --> 41:00.290
Guys, it says "Andy."

41:00.375 --> 41:01.625
He's my Bonnie.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.794
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.588
- Where's home?
- Elm Street. 234 Elm.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.966
- You guys have a map?
- We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?

41:10.760 --> 41:12.427
I 'll fire up the computer.

41:17.725 --> 41:21.019
Unhand me, you cowards!
I demand to talk to Lotso!

41:21.104 --> 41:22.687
Zip it, Buck Rogers.

41:22.772 --> 41:25.440
You don't talk to Lotso
till we say you can...

41:27.110 --> 41:31.321
Ken? What's goin' on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

41:31.739 --> 41:33.198
He got out, Lotso.

41:33.741 --> 41:39.704
"Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.

41:39.789 --> 41:44.251
F-A-oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I 'm so sorry.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.878
- Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?

41:46.963 --> 41:49.172
The children in the Caterpillar Room
are not age-appropriate

41:49.257 --> 41:50.507
for me and my friends.

41:50.591 --> 41:53.552
We respectfully request
a transfer to the Butterfly Room.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.470
Well, request granted!

41:55.596 --> 41:57.973
- But, Lotso...
- Hush now, Kenneth.

41:58.057 --> 42:01.351
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.603
Why, I 'd say
we've found ourselves a keeper.

42:04.063 --> 42:06.606
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!

42:09.861 --> 42:12.529
We're calling you up
to the big leagues, son.

42:12.613 --> 42:15.449
From now on,
you'll have anything you want.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.576
Excellent. I 'll go get my friends.

42:17.660 --> 42:20.245
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

42:20.329 --> 42:22.706
Those Caterpillar kids
need someone to play with.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.708
But my friends don't belong there.

42:24.792 --> 42:26.877
None of us do, I agree.

42:26.961 --> 42:30.380
Which is why,
for the good of our community,

42:30.465 --> 42:32.924
we ask the newer toys,
the stronger ones,

42:33.009 --> 42:36.720
to take on the hardships
the rest of us can't bear anymore.

42:37.722 --> 42:40.223
Well, I guess that makes sense.

42:41.642 --> 42:45.061
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.939
Family man, huh? I understand.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.233
Put him back in the timeout chair.

42:51.235 --> 42:53.695
What are ya... Unhand me!

42:55.239 --> 42:56.823
Bring in the Bookworm.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.287
Here it is.

43:02.830 --> 43:05.499
It was filed under "Lightyear."

43:10.505 --> 43:11.713
Let's see here.

43:12.381 --> 43:15.175
"Accessories. Maintenance."
Here we go.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.929
"Remove screws to access
battery compartment."

43:19.013 --> 43:20.180
What are you doing?

43:20.848 --> 43:21.848
Stop!

43:22.016 --> 43:23.475
Let go of me!

43:23.518 --> 43:28.897
"To return your Buzz Lightyear action
figure to its original factory settings..."

43:28.981 --> 43:29.940
No!

43:30.024 --> 43:32.943
"...slide the switch from
Play to Demo."

43:33.027 --> 43:36.530
Stop! No! No! No!

43:37.949 --> 43:40.283
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.

43:40.368 --> 43:41.993
I 'll see what it was.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.289
What do you see? Anything?

43:46.374 --> 43:49.918
No, just a dark hallway and...
Wait. Wait!

43:50.336 --> 43:51.670
I see Andy!

43:52.004 --> 43:53.505
- What?
- That's impossible.

43:53.589 --> 43:56.049
No, no, I really see him. In his room.

43:56.968 --> 44:00.053
My other eye! The one I left behind.

44:02.807 --> 44:06.226
'His is so weird. He's packing up.

44:07.311 --> 44:11.815
Here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!

44:12.858 --> 44:14.901
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.821
He's looking in the attic.

44:17.905 --> 44:21.241
Wait, there's Mom.
Why is he so upset?

44:22.326 --> 44:25.078
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

44:26.581 --> 44:29.666
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!

44:29.750 --> 44:31.251
He's looking for us?

44:31.335 --> 44:34.170
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!

44:34.255 --> 44:36.590
I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

44:36.882 --> 44:38.425
Well, then,
Woody was telling the truth.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.677
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.304
Hey, you didn't believe him first!

44:42.388 --> 44:45.307
Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!

44:47.768 --> 44:48.977
- Lotso!
- Hey, there.

44:49.645 --> 44:51.646
How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?

44:52.106 --> 44:54.024
Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?

44:54.108 --> 44:56.484
There's been a mistake.
We have to go.

44:56.569 --> 45:01.072
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.

45:01.157 --> 45:04.117
We were runnin' low on volunteers
for the little ones.

45:04.201 --> 45:06.953
They just love new toys,
now, don't they?

45:07.121 --> 45:09.998
"Love"? We've been chewed,
kicked, drooled on.

45:10.082 --> 45:12.042
Just look at my pocketbook!

45:13.294 --> 45:17.464
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin' Sunnyside.

45:17.798 --> 45:20.967
"Sweet potato"!
Who do you think you're talking to?

45:21.218 --> 45:25.847
I have over 30 accessories,
and I deserve more respect...

45:26.766 --> 45:28.391
That's better.

45:28.476 --> 45:31.061
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth,
except me.

45:31.145 --> 45:33.188
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

45:33.272 --> 45:34.939
Come on, guys. We're goin' home.

45:35.024 --> 45:36.066
Whoa there, missy.

45:36.484 --> 45:38.151
You're not goin' anywhere.

45:38.402 --> 45:41.029
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?

45:43.324 --> 45:44.658
Buzz! You're back!

45:45.159 --> 45:46.201
Buzz?

45:47.244 --> 45:48.286
Hey!

45:49.330 --> 45:50.664
Look out!

45:50.998 --> 45:52.165
What are you, nuts?

45:52.375 --> 45:53.416
Buzz!

45:57.129 --> 45:59.464
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!

45:59.548 --> 46:01.758
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence, minions of Zurg!

46:01.842 --> 46:03.927
You're in the custody
of the Galactic Alliance!

46:04.011 --> 46:05.470
- "Zurg"?
- "Galactic Alliance"?

46:05.554 --> 46:06.596
Oh, boy.

46:06.681 --> 46:09.432
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!

46:09.517 --> 46:10.517
Yes, sir!

46:20.486 --> 46:22.779
Where do you think you're going?

46:24.115 --> 46:25.782
Buzz! We're your friends!

46:25.866 --> 46:27.826
Spare me your lies, temptress.

46:27.910 --> 46:29.369
Your emperor's defeated,

46:29.453 --> 46:32.580
and I 'm immune to
your bewitching good looks.

46:32.665 --> 46:35.291
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!

46:35.376 --> 46:37.127
Hey! Let go of me,
you drooling doofus!

46:37.211 --> 46:38.169
Not him.

46:38.254 --> 46:41.798
I think this potato needs to
learn himself some manners.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.633
Take him to the box.

46:43.718 --> 46:46.469
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?

46:46.554 --> 46:47.971
Bad baby! Bad baby!

46:48.055 --> 46:49.597
Ken? What's going on?

46:49.932 --> 46:52.976
Barbie! I told you to wait
in the Dream House.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.352
What are you doing to my friends?

46:54.729 --> 46:56.229
Get in there!

46:57.732 --> 46:59.607
- Barbie, wait!
- Don't touch me.

46:59.692 --> 47:02.193
- We're through!
- Barbie! I did...

47:03.904 --> 47:05.905
And give me my scarf back!

47:07.867 --> 47:10.744
Lightyear! Explain our
overnight accommodations.

47:11.162 --> 47:13.955
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.

47:14.081 --> 47:17.792
Any prisoner caught outside their cell
spends the night in the box.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.044
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

47:20.463 --> 47:24.257
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

47:24.592 --> 47:27.343
Prisoners do not speak
unless spoken to.

47:27.428 --> 47:29.721
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night...

47:29.805 --> 47:31.264
In the box! We get it.

47:32.641 --> 47:35.477
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.

47:35.561 --> 47:39.022
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

47:39.106 --> 47:40.440
Don't worry, Commander.

47:40.524 --> 47:43.693
Any doubt I had got pounded
out of me at the academy.

47:44.403 --> 47:45.904
Listen up, folks.

47:45.988 --> 47:48.531
We got a way of doin' things
here at Sunnyside.

47:48.991 --> 47:51.659
If you start at the bottom,
pay your dues,

47:51.744 --> 47:54.037
life here can be a dream come true!

47:54.830 --> 47:57.916
But if you break our rules,
step outta line,

47:58.709 --> 48:04.339
try to check out early,
well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.967
Woody! What did you do to him?

48:08.469 --> 48:10.804
You all get a good night's rest.

48:11.472 --> 48:14.182
You got a full day
of playtime tomorrow.

48:20.189 --> 48:23.566
1225 Syca...

48:24.818 --> 48:27.111
Who's Velocistar237?

48:27.488 --> 48:29.739
That's just a dinosaur toy
down the street.

48:29.823 --> 48:32.242
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.

48:32.326 --> 48:34.118
- Just a dinosaur.
- All right.

48:34.578 --> 48:37.330
Sycamore. Okay, enter!

48:38.165 --> 48:40.208
Please don't be far. Please, please!

48:41.752 --> 48:45.046
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!

48:46.131 --> 48:50.468
I 'm going to college! Look at me!
I 'm big toy on campus! Hello!

48:50.553 --> 48:53.263
- Hey, I 'll see you at the sock hop.
- Okay, Potsie.

48:53.514 --> 48:56.933
Hey, listen. If any of you guys
ever get to Sunnyside Daycare,

48:57.017 --> 48:58.101
you tell 'em Woody made it home.

48:58.185 --> 49:01.396
- You came from Sunnyside?
- But how'd you escape?

49:01.480 --> 49:03.314
Well, it wasn't easy.

49:04.316 --> 49:05.525
What do you mean "escape"?

49:07.152 --> 49:10.238
Sunnyside is a place
of ruin and despair.

49:10.322 --> 49:13.866
Ruled by an evil bear
who smells of strawberries.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.202
Lotso?

49:16.287 --> 49:18.955
The guy may seem plush
and huggable on the outside,

49:19.039 --> 49:20.748
but inside, he's a monster.

49:21.041 --> 49:23.209
But... How do you know that?

49:23.877 --> 49:26.212
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

49:32.219 --> 49:33.970
Yeah, I knew Lotso.

49:35.389 --> 49:38.099
He was a good toy. A friend.

49:38.934 --> 49:42.604
Me and him,
we had the same kid, Daisy.

49:44.148 --> 49:47.066
A was there
when Lotso got unwrapped.

49:49.486 --> 49:51.237
Daisy loved us all.

49:51.739 --> 49:52.905
But Lotso,

49:53.365 --> 49:55.158
Lotso was special.

49:56.619 --> 49:58.828
'Hey did everything together.

49:59.913 --> 50:02.957
You've never seen
a kid and a toy more in love.

50:03.792 --> 50:05.793
One day, we took a drive.

50:06.879 --> 50:10.089
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.

50:11.091 --> 50:13.176
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

50:22.353 --> 50:23.978
She never came back.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.444
Lotso wouldn't give up.

50:34.990 --> 50:38.368
It took forever,
but we finally made it back to Daisy's.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.960
But by then, it was too late.

50:59.515 --> 51:02.308
Something changed that day
inside Lotso.

51:03.018 --> 51:04.602
Something snapped.

51:04.687 --> 51:07.146
She replaced us. Come on!

51:07.231 --> 51:10.108
- No, she only replaced you!
- She replaced all of us.

51:10.818 --> 51:11.859
Didn't she?

51:14.988 --> 51:17.365
She don't love you no more!

51:17.700 --> 51:19.117
Now come on!

51:23.997 --> 51:29.627
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.

51:34.591 --> 51:36.551
'Hen we found Sunnyside.

51:47.396 --> 51:49.731
But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.484
He wasn't anyone's friend.

51:56.196 --> 51:59.282
He took over Sunnyside
and rigged the whole system.

51:59.908 --> 52:01.826
So how'd you get out?

52:02.202 --> 52:05.580
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.

52:06.248 --> 52:08.332
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

52:09.209 --> 52:12.545
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys,

52:13.380 --> 52:15.298
they don't stand a chance.

52:15.591 --> 52:17.884
- But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.344
Returning now would be suicide!

52:20.429 --> 52:22.221
But what about your Andy?

52:22.306 --> 52:25.224
Isn't he leaving for college?

52:43.869 --> 52:46.162
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

52:49.249 --> 52:52.293
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.

52:54.505 --> 52:56.756
But he ain't ever comin' back.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.988
Rise and shine, campers!

53:21.073 --> 53:22.657
Commander Lotso, sir!

53:23.575 --> 53:25.034
All quiet, nothing to report.

53:25.118 --> 53:28.663
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.

53:28.747 --> 53:31.123
Wait! What've you done
with my husband?

53:31.708 --> 53:32.708
Big Baby.

53:38.465 --> 53:39.632
Sweetheart!

53:41.134 --> 53:45.221
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of Lincoln Logs.

53:46.014 --> 53:47.640
I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.

53:47.724 --> 53:51.477
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!

55:13.852 --> 55:14.852
Hello?

55:14.936 --> 55:16.646
You shouldn't have
come back, cowboy.

55:16.730 --> 55:21.108
'Hey've cracked down hard since
you left. More guards, more patrols.

55:21.193 --> 55:23.319
You and your friends
ain't ever getting out of here now.

55:23.403 --> 55:24.654
I made it out once.

55:24.738 --> 55:27.615
You got lucky once. Want my advice?

55:27.699 --> 55:30.117
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.

55:30.202 --> 55:31.827
Yeah, for how long?

55:31.912 --> 55:33.079
I've been here years.

55:33.580 --> 55:35.539
'Hey'll never break me.

55:35.624 --> 55:38.417
'Here's only one way
toys leave this place.

55:39.419 --> 55:42.046
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.

55:42.506 --> 55:44.382
Then it's off to the dump.

55:44.841 --> 55:47.176
Look, I appreciate
your concern, old-timer.

55:47.260 --> 55:50.346
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.

55:50.430 --> 55:53.683
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I 'd sure be grateful.

55:55.560 --> 55:57.937
Well, if you're gonna get out,

55:58.021 --> 55:59.772
first thing you gotta get through's
the doors.

56:00.440 --> 56:04.694
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.

56:04.778 --> 56:05.820
Got it. What else?

56:05.904 --> 56:08.114
Lotso has trucks
patrolling all night long.

56:08.615 --> 56:10.533
Hallway, lobby, playground.

56:10.617 --> 56:11.701
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?

56:11.785 --> 56:15.121
Eight-feet high. Cinder block.
No way through it.

56:15.205 --> 56:16.455
You go over or under.

56:16.832 --> 56:18.708
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.

56:18.792 --> 56:21.460
It's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.

56:22.754 --> 56:25.381
The monkey's the eye in the sky.

56:25.465 --> 56:27.049
He sees everything.

56:27.884 --> 56:29.301
Classrooms.

56:40.147 --> 56:41.480
Hallways.

56:50.490 --> 56:52.074
Even the playground.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.753
You can unlock doors,
sneak past guards, climb the wall,

57:04.337 --> 57:07.465
but if you don't take out that monkey,
you ain't going nowhere.

57:08.049 --> 57:11.260
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!

57:12.471 --> 57:14.388
Recess! Come on, kids!

57:20.812 --> 57:21.937
Hey, guys.

57:22.898 --> 57:24.398
- Woody?
- Woody!

57:24.858 --> 57:25.858
Woody!

57:26.359 --> 57:28.736
- Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
- Thank goodness!

57:28.820 --> 57:31.071
- You're alive!
- 'Course I 'm alive!

57:32.324 --> 57:35.117
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?

57:35.202 --> 57:36.869
Lotso did something to him!

57:36.953 --> 57:39.121
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.

57:39.206 --> 57:40.623
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

57:40.999 --> 57:42.583
Return of the astro-nut.

57:42.918 --> 57:47.421
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I was wrong.

57:47.756 --> 57:50.132
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

57:50.217 --> 57:53.469
No, no, it's my fault
for leaving you guys.

57:53.553 --> 57:55.805
From now on, we stick together.

57:55.889 --> 57:57.640
But Andy's leavin' for college.

57:57.724 --> 57:59.600
College? Hog-tie the mailman!

57:59.684 --> 58:02.311
We gotta get you home
before Andy leaves tomorrow!

58:02.395 --> 58:03.938
Tomorrow? But that means...

58:04.022 --> 58:06.023
It means
we're busting out of here, tonight.

58:06.107 --> 58:08.984
- What? Impossible!
- But there's no way out of here!

58:09.402 --> 58:11.403
No, there is one way out.

58:11.947 --> 58:12.947
One way.

58:15.492 --> 58:17.409
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

58:23.083 --> 58:25.000
- Springy dog.
- Present.

58:25.585 --> 58:27.169
Green guys.

58:27.254 --> 58:29.380
- Cowgirl.
- Here.

58:29.798 --> 58:30.965
Horse.

58:32.092 --> 58:33.592
- Piggy bank.
- Y o.

58:34.177 --> 58:35.803
- Tyrannosaurus.
- Here.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.055
- Barbie.
- Here.

58:38.598 --> 58:40.015
Potato Head.

58:41.142 --> 58:42.560
Potato Head?

58:43.728 --> 58:46.480
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!

58:47.482 --> 58:48.858
Impossible!

58:50.485 --> 58:51.527
Hey!

59:05.041 --> 59:06.917
Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?

59:07.377 --> 59:09.587
That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
smoothie.

59:09.921 --> 59:13.340
Well, well, well. You're turning out to
be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?

59:13.466 --> 59:16.051
What did you think you were
gonna do? Waltz right out of here?

59:16.136 --> 59:17.386
Yeah, and I would 've got away
with it, too,

59:17.470 --> 59:19.054
if it weren't for you meddling toys!

59:19.139 --> 59:20.514
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!

59:20.891 --> 59:22.975
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!

59:23.059 --> 59:25.227
You're a purse with legs.

59:25.312 --> 59:26.645
Take him back to the box.

59:26.980 --> 59:31.066
No! No, not the box! I 'm sorry.
I didn't mean it! I like ascots.

59:31.401 --> 59:33.652
Really. No, no, no!

59:34.195 --> 59:35.237
Okay, check.

59:35.488 --> 59:39.408
Good work, Lightyear. All right,
resume your space-guy-thingy.

59:39.492 --> 59:41.869
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!

59:41.953 --> 59:44.079
Ken! Ken?

59:47.208 --> 59:48.542
What do you want?

59:48.627 --> 59:52.046
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go
to the Butterfly Room. With you!

59:52.130 --> 59:53.964
Yeah, well, you should 've
thought of that yesterday.

59:54.174 --> 59:55.424
I was wrong.

59:55.508 --> 59:58.636
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.139
Please take me away from this!
Take me away!

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:04.558
Darn it, Barbie!

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:07.603
Okay, but things
are complicated around here.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:10.814
- You gotta do what I say.
- I will, Ken! I promise!

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:15.653
Wait. I 'll do anything!
I 'll change your diapers!

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.201
Go get the tape!

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.585
And this is where the magic happens.

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:16.296
Look at all your clothes!

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:18.215
I can't believe
you never brought me up here!

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:20.759
- Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
- I know, I know, I know.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.553
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:25.806
Campus hero
with matching sports pennant, huh?

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:28.475
Flower power! Oh, Ken!

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:33.355
No one appreciates clothes
here, Barbie. No one.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:38.402
Ken, would you
model a few outfits for me?

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.362
Just a few?

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.144
Go get the key.

01:02:13.646 --> 01:02:14.772
Where is it, where is it?

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.815
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!

01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:29.369
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.372
I told you,
keep your hands off of my stuff!

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.166
Make a move, porky!

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:37.795
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:42.216
- Hey! Hey!
- Take that, walnut-brain.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.467
No wonder you're extinct.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.720
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:52.184
Help! Prison riot!

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:56.814
Get the tortilla.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:38.772
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:47.823
Barbie?

01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:52.703
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:54.037
And how do we switch him back?

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.039
You can't make me talk. You can't!

01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.418
But I 'd like to see you try.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.889
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.725
Barbie! Those were vintage!

01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:58.685
It's okay. All right, go ahead,
rip 'em, I don't care.

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.229
They're a dime a dozen.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.647
Glitter tux.

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:06.568
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.862
A Nehru jacket.

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:10.405
Barbie! Not the Nehru.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:13.242
This is from what, 1967?

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:14.910
The groovy formal collection, yes!

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:18.664
- What a shame.
- Oh, no, no, no! No!

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:20.832
There's an instruction manual!

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:24.294
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.172
Where's that manual?

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:31.260
I don't know why
this couldn't wait until morning, Ken,

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:33.512
but here you go.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.151
What's takin' so doggone long?

01:05:52.407 --> 01:05:53.907
So how do we fix Buzz?

01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:13.302
What are you looking at, feathers?

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:16.638
Hey!

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.812
Yeah, fly away, you coward.

01:06:26.899 --> 01:06:28.900
Well, that's just great.

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:36.491
Help! Prison riot!

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.744
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Give it up. No one can hear you.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:42.247
- What?
- I said, "No one can hear you."

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.250
- What?
- He said, "No one can..."

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:46.960
Shush! Will you be quiet?

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.587
Woody! You're back!

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:53.800
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:56.887
Star Command! I 've been
taken hostage by my own prisoners.

01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.724
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:02.392
Unhand me, Zurg scum!

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:05.103
The Galactic Courts
will show you no mercy.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.690
It's not working. Why is it
not working? Where's the manual?

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:11.360
Here we go! There should be
a little hole under the switch.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:14.071
- Little hole, got it!
- "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:16.239
- "insert paperclip..."
- Rex, use your finger!

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:17.324
What?

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:19.618
- Okay, now what?
- All right, let's see.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.954
"Caution. Do not hold button
for more than five seconds."

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.459
It's not my fault!

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:39.554
- Now what did you do?
- I just did what you told me!

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.272
Amigos! We're all amigos.

01:07:56.823 --> 01:07:58.073
We gotta switch him back.

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:01.243
- Well, how do we do that?
- I don't know. That part's in Spanish.

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:04.037
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El Buzzo.

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.835
Good luck, cowboy.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.134
Here they come.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.011
Come on, Buzz!

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.265
What took you so long?

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.600
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.060
We haven't seen him.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:31.606
Buzz.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:42.200
Did you fix Buzz?

01:08:43.035 --> 01:08:44.493
- Sort of.
- Behind you.

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:46.121
Someone's coming.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:52.627
You would not believe
what I 've been through tonight.

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:54.462
Darling! Are you okay?

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:57.048
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:09:00.260
You've lost weight. And so tall.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:04.389
You're a sight for detachable eyes.

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:10.937
All clear.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.151
Come on. Come on.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.321
We're almost there.

01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:25.410
Back up. Back up!

01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:33.335
Come on.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.664
Woody!

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.501
Come on. We're almost there.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.762
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:21.484
Way to go, Buzz. Come on.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:28.950
- Is it safe?
- I guess I 'll find out.

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:37.292
- Woody? You okay?
- Yeah.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:40.295
Come on down. But not all at once.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.255
- What did he say?
- I think he said, "All at once."

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:43.631
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.133
- Geronimo!
- Look out!

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:49.929
Thanks, Jess.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:52.724
Almost there, guys.

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.393
Slink, you think you can make it?

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:58.772
Well, I might be old,
but I still got a spring in my step.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.026
- He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins.

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.819
Okay, climb across.

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:09.282
You lost, little doggie?

01:12:13.245 --> 01:12:15.622
Well, well. Look who's back.

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:25.256
I'm sorry, cowboy.

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:28.218
They broke me.

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:31.054
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:33.765
He don't want you no more.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:35.058
- That's a lie.
- Is it?

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:37.268
Tell me this, Sheriff.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:40.480
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.774
You think you're special, cowboy?

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:47.445
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:50.698
Speak of the devil.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.749
Now, we need toys
in our Caterpillar Room

01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:02.502
and you need to avoid that truck.

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:06.464
Why don't you come on back,
join our family again?

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:10.051
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:14.430
And I 'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours!

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:18.268
Jessie's right! Authority should derive
from the consent of the governed,

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:19.644
not from the threat of force.

01:13:21.021 --> 01:13:22.939
If that's what you want.

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:27.861
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:32.157
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.325
Not to me, there's not.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:38.496
Fine. Then why don't you join her!

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:42.917
Oh, Ken!

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.169
Everyone, listen!

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:47.630
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy
if we treated each other fair.

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:50.884
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid,

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.635
and he put himself on top!

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.721
Anyone concur with Ken?

01:13:57.892 --> 01:14:00.602
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:03.271
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.

01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:05.273
Chew on that
when you're at the dump.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:07.358
Wait! What about Daisy?

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.321
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:14.032
Daisy? You used to do
everything with her?

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.117
- Yeah? Then she threw us out.
- No.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:18.953
- She lost you.
- She replaced us!

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:20.872
She replaced you.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.790
And if you couldn't have her
then no one could.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.460
You lied to Big Baby
and you've been lying ever since.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:29.255
- Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.506
She never loved me.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:32.467
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:37.805
Mama.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.683
What? You want your mommy back?

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:43.603
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.316
Push 'em in. All of 'em!

01:14:49.401 --> 01:14:52.403
This is what happens
when you dummies try to think.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:57.116
We're all just trash, waiting to be
thrown away! That's all a toy is!

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.788
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:06.417
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:11.714
- He's gone!
- Holy cow.

01:15:16.804 --> 01:15:18.054
Come on. Hurry!

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.062
For crying out loud!

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:31.609
Woody!

01:15:36.156 --> 01:15:37.949
Oh, boy. Incoming!

01:15:40.285 --> 01:15:41.369
Come on!

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:43.871
Barbie, no!

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.502
Woody!

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:54.632
No!

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:01.222
Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?

01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:04.100
Of course not, you imbecile.
We're doomed!

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.603
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:12.108
We all here? Slinky? Rex?

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.406
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:21.576
Buzz!

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:33.171
They'll never make it!

01:16:43.057 --> 01:16:44.098
Look out!

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:49.979
Buzz!

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:59.739
- Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:04.994
Buzz, you okay?

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:08.164
Buzz! Buzz!

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:19.675
That wasn't me, was it?

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:23.805
Buzz, you're back! You're back,
you're back, you're back, you're back!

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:26.474
Yes, I 'm back. Where have I been?

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:28.810
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:32.063
Woody! So where are we now?

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.565
In a garbage truck
on the way to the dump!

01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:49.872
Hold on, we're going in!

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:06.848
You got all your pieces?

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:08.516
The claw!

01:18:09.309 --> 01:18:12.145
- My babies!
- Hey, guys! No! No!

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:14.605
No!

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.488
Hang on!

01:18:35.627 --> 01:18:37.044
Woody! What do we do?

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.838
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:41.757
- Woody!
- Slinky!

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:45.303
It's a magnet! Watch out!

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:48.181
Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down.

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:49.932
You might wanna take a look at this.

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:55.521
Quick! Grab something metal!

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:02.195
You heard the guy.

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:07.825
It's not working!

01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:14.707
Help! Help me. I 'm stuck!

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.585
Help, please! Help!

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:19.378
Woody!

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.674
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:27.595
Woody!

01:19:37.397 --> 01:19:38.522
Go, go!

01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:45.905
Thank you, Sheriff.

01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:47.198
We're all in this together.

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:48.616
Right, guys?

01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:51.118
Guys?

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.537
Woody! Down here!

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.209
- Woody!
- Oh, boy.

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.546
Woody, look. I can see daylight.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.382
We're gonna be okay!

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:06.342
Hey!

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:08.678
I don't think that's daylight.

01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:16.143
Run!

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:36.038
Sheriff! The button! Help me!

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:37.164
Come on!

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.377
Go. Go! Hit the button!

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:50.094
Hurry!

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:55.891
- Just push it! Push it!
- Push it!

01:20:56.977 --> 01:20:59.353
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?

01:20:59.896 --> 01:21:01.022
No. No!

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:02.273
Lotso!

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:05.735
No!

01:21:22.919 --> 01:21:23.919
Rex!

01:21:29.926 --> 01:21:32.094
Buzz! What do we do?

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:54.260
The claw.

01:23:22.205 --> 01:23:25.082
You know all that bad stuff I said
about Andy's attic?

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:26.417
I take it all back.

01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:28.502
- You're darn tootin'.
- You said it.

01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:37.720
Oh, darling. You were so brave.

01:23:39.222 --> 01:23:42.558
- You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.

01:23:43.935 --> 01:23:45.227
My boys!

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.520
Daddy!

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.064
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:51.192
Yeah. I 'd like to loosen his stitchin'.

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:54.028
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.

01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:04.872
- Hey!
- What you got?

01:24:04.956 --> 01:24:07.625
I had me one of these
when I was a kid.

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:09.877
Strawberries.

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:17.134
Hey, buddy. You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:25.726
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:28.229
- That's right, college boy.
- Wait.

01:24:29.105 --> 01:24:30.314
What about you guys? I mean,

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:33.984
maybe the attic's
not such a great idea.

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:39.073
- We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him, together.

01:24:40.825 --> 01:24:43.118
- I just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute!

01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:44.912
Wait, I 'll check!

01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:48.958
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done!

01:24:49.042 --> 01:24:52.836
- He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time!

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:11.063
- Come on, Buster.
- Is that it, honey? You got everything?

01:25:11.147 --> 01:25:12.815
Yeah. Just a few more boxes
in my room.

01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:13.899
Okay. Come on.

01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:18.696
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.698
All right. Go. Go, go!

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.457
Okay. All clear.

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:40.759
There you are.

01:25:46.891 --> 01:25:48.684
- There you go.
- Buzz.

01:25:52.063 --> 01:25:56.108
- This isn't goodbye.
- Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.

01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:58.068
Yeah, but not too much fun.

01:25:59.612 --> 01:26:02.239
- Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:04.950
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.

01:26:05.785 --> 01:26:06.785
Sure thing.

01:26:08.079 --> 01:26:10.873
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:14.376
'Course I will. Besides, I know about

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:17.046
- Buzz's Spanish mode.
- My what?

01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:18.714
Honey, you want some food
for the road?

01:26:18.798 --> 01:26:19.882
I 'll get something on the way.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.260
You know where to find us, cowboy.

01:26:38.401 --> 01:26:39.777
Did you say goodbye to Molly?

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:42.488
Mom, we've said goodbye
like 10 times.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:47.451
Andy.

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.668
Mom, it's okay.

01:26:58.338 --> 01:27:00.297
I know. It's just...

01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:05.761
I wish I could always be with you.

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:09.640
You will be, Mom.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.157
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye
to Buster?

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:29.451
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?

01:27:29.536 --> 01:27:32.413
Who's a good doggy? I 'm gonna
miss you. I 'm gonna miss you.

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:40.170
- I 'm gonna miss you.
- Don't, Andy.

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:46.385
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.

01:27:46.469 --> 01:27:47.636
Come on. Get the rest of your things.

01:27:48.012 --> 01:27:51.181
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

01:27:57.730 --> 01:27:58.814
Hey.

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:09.741
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
I should donate these?

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:13.036
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:43.734
"Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:47.112
"Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts."

01:28:47.197 --> 01:28:49.656
"Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!"

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:53.118
Mom.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.496
- Andy?
- Hi.

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.372
Wow. Look at you.

01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:59.333
Well, I hear you're off to college.

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:01.335
Yeah. Right now, actually.

01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:03.545
So, what can we do for you?

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:05.839
I have some toys here.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:07.925
You hear that, Bonnie?

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:10.469
So, you're Bonnie?

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:12.971
I 'm Andy.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:16.767
Someone told me
you're really good with toys.

01:29:17.393 --> 01:29:20.687
These are mine,
but I 'm going away now,

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:23.774
so I need someone really special
to play with them.

01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:35.118
This is Jessie, the roughest,
toughest cowgirl in the whole West.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:39.665
She loves critters, but none more
than her best pal, Bullseye.

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:43.794
Here.

01:29:57.350 --> 01:30:02.062
This is Rex, the meanest, most
terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!

01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:12.072
The Potato Heads. Mr. And Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,

01:30:12.323 --> 01:30:14.324
'cause they're madly in love.

01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:18.412
Now Slinky here is
as loyal as any dog you could want.

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:21.331
And Hamm,
he'll keep your money safe,

01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:26.628
but he's also one of the most dastardly
villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop.

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:32.843
These little dudes
are from a strange alien world.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.594
Pizza Planet.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.514
And this

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:43.312
is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!

01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:46.481
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!

01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:50.193
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil Emperor Zurg.

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:54.531
To infinity and beyond!

01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:58.702
Now, you gotta promise
to take good care of these guys.

01:31:00.872 --> 01:31:04.499
They mean a lot to me.

01:31:10.381 --> 01:31:11.715
My cowboy!

01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:17.763
Woody? What's he doing in there?

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:21.516
- "There's a snake in my boot."
- Wha?

01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:25.687
There's a snake in my boot.

01:31:39.869 --> 01:31:44.081
Now, Woody, he's been my pal
for as long as I can remember.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:47.918
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.

01:31:48.586 --> 01:31:49.961
And kind. And smart.

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:55.884
But the thing that makes Woody
special is he'll never give up on you.

01:31:57.261 --> 01:31:58.387
Ever.

01:31:59.263 --> 01:32:01.973
He'll be there for you, no matter what.

01:32:05.812 --> 01:32:08.605
You think you can
take care of him for me?

01:32:09.607 --> 01:32:10.732
Okay then.

01:32:21.994 --> 01:32:25.539
Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop's attacking
the haunted bakery!

01:32:25.623 --> 01:32:28.333
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop 'em!

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:29.960
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

01:32:31.087 --> 01:32:32.796
And we'll actually need the rocket.

01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:35.799
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!

01:32:38.344 --> 01:32:41.888
We need to get in the spaceship.
The volcano is gonna erupt.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:44.766
Look! They're being attacked
by a real dog!

01:32:44.851 --> 01:32:46.226
You can eat my poisonous scones!

01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:48.478
Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head
are in trouble.

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:50.105
Get on, Woody.

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:53.608
It's my friend Woody.

01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:57.279
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.

01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:26.183
Thanks, guys.

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.772
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:34.357
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

01:33:48.539 --> 01:33:50.207
So long, partner.

01:33:55.213 --> 01:33:58.590
Hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.

01:33:58.674 --> 01:34:01.384
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.

01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:33.250
New toys!

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.846
Noses.

01:36:05.968 --> 01:36:10.221
"So I guess you could say
Sunnyside is sunny once again!

01:36:10.348 --> 01:36:13.850
"Hope to hear from you soon. We're all
super excited about your new home.

01:36:13.934 --> 01:36:16.519
"Hugs and kisses to everyone."

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:20.690
That Barbie has some
nice handwriting.

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:24.152
Buzz, Barbie didn't write this.

01:36:26.697 --> 01:36:27.864
- Grab the sword!
- I got it!

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:29.115
- Okay, go for the...
- Triple bonus!

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.283
- Watch out!
- We got the cloak of darkness!

01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:33.119
- Run, run!
- My arms are never long enough!

01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:35.580
I 'll do it! This is it! This is it!

01:36:36.207 --> 01:36:37.791
- Yes!
- We did it!

01:36:37.875 --> 01:36:39.834
High-five! Hold on.

01:36:42.338 --> 01:36:45.298
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.

01:36:45.383 --> 01:36:48.468
- Look at this!
- Golly bob howdy! That's me!

01:36:48.552 --> 01:36:51.846
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, lookin' good.

01:36:51.931 --> 01:36:54.265
Yeah, she really got your smile.

01:37:01.607 --> 01:37:03.024
What the...

01:37:04.902 --> 01:37:07.737
I told you kids! Stay out of my butt!

01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:12.242
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

01:37:12.576 --> 01:37:15.912
Romeo, o Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:18.540
Next season, we're doing Cats.

01:37:18.624 --> 01:37:21.292
Or might I suggest Hamlet?

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:25.255
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.

01:37:25.589 --> 01:37:27.924
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.812
I don't know what came over me.

01:37:42.106 --> 01:42:36.941
Just go with it, Buzz.
