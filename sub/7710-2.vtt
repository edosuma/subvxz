00:41.542 --> 00:43.477
Hey, what's up?

00:43.511 --> 00:45.146
Hey.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.814
Any emails today?

00:46.847 --> 00:48.516
Um, I don't think so.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.817
No?

00:49.850 --> 00:53.454
Um, check your spam folder.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.190
Oh, there it is.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.491
What?

00:57.525 --> 01:03.797
Um...50 signs your priest
might be Michael Jackson.

01:03.831 --> 01:07.135
Well done.
Topical.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.137
I am king of forwards.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.472
It's how I like
to do business.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.374
Everybody joking around.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.109
We're like Friends.

01:15.143 --> 01:18.179
I am Chandler.

01:18.212 --> 01:21.282
And Joey.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.851
And, uh, Pam is Rachel.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.554
And Dwight is Kramer.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.690
So the monkey
does the sex thing right...

01:29.723 --> 01:31.392
here!

01:32.426 --> 01:33.727
That's funny!

01:33.761 --> 01:34.862
That's funny.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.497
Not offensive.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.232
Because it's nature,
educational.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.867
Do want the link?

01:39.900 --> 01:41.502
'Cause then you could
forward it around.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.137
Um, I...

01:43.171 --> 01:44.805
Consider it.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.507
Maybe, maybe.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.209
Well, we'll see.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.777
Because I don't know
if it's a--

01:49.810 --> 01:50.778
Wha--come on!

01:50.811 --> 01:53.481
What has two thumbs
and likes to bone your mom?

01:53.514 --> 01:55.316
This guy!

01:57.585 --> 01:58.886
Oh, you are so bad.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.188
Yeah.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.889
Oh, phew, ro, rah!
Aaah!

02:01.922 --> 02:03.524
Oh, this guy
is out of control.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.393
He is a madman.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.527
Better get the bleep button
ready for him.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.861
Bleep bleep!

02:09.697 --> 02:11.665
What's up, Halpert?
Still queer?

02:11.699 --> 02:13.867
Uh-oh!

02:13.901 --> 02:14.668
Oh ho ho!

02:14.702 --> 02:18.906
Todd Packer and I
are total BFF.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.374
Best friends forever.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.876
He and I came up together
as salesmen.

02:22.910 --> 02:28.749
One time we were out
and we met this set of twins.

02:28.782 --> 02:32.720
And Packer told them
that we were brothers.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.756
And so, you know,
one thing led to another.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.626
And we brought 'em back
to the motel.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.263
And then Packer
did both of them.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.797
It was awesome.

02:43.831 --> 02:44.798
It was...

02:44.832 --> 02:46.200
Ow ow ow!
Oh.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.969
Okay, grade A gossip
for you right now.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.705
Randall, CFO, resigned.

02:51.739 --> 02:52.706
Nobody knows why.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.442
Are you kidding?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.976
Everyone knows why!

02:56.009 --> 02:57.745
You don't know?
Oh, okay, check this out.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.647
All right,
so here's the story.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.582
So Randall is nailing
his secretary, right?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.684
And she's totally
incompetent.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.818
Really?
Here we go.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.588
Buckle up, it's gonna be
a bumpy one.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.757
We're talking "blonde
incompetent," right?

03:09.790 --> 03:10.758
Oh, yeah.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.925
Like, uh,
ten words a minute.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.561
Talking.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.463
Well, to be fair,
blondes, brunettes.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.964
You know, there are a lot
of dumb people out there.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.566
They are women, right?

03:18.599 --> 03:20.401
Oh, wow!

03:20.434 --> 03:21.769
I didn't say it!
I didn't say it!

03:21.802 --> 03:23.371
I said it.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.640
And then, suddenly,
for no reason,

03:26.674 --> 03:28.876
this bimbo blows the whistle
on the whole thing

03:28.909 --> 03:30.711
just to be a bitch.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.347
Oh, wow, what'd I tell you
about the bleep button?

03:33.381 --> 03:36.684
Hey, what has two thumbs
and hates Todd Packer?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.686
This guy!

03:38.719 --> 03:40.488
I meant to ask you,
you think you can get someone

03:40.521 --> 03:42.890
to drive me around because of
the DUI situation?

03:42.923 --> 03:45.459
Oh, bad boy.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.528
Um, Ryan.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.531
Come on, kid,
let's go.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.532
Oh, man.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.434
That Todd Packer
can do anything.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.469
Except pass
that breathalyzer.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.710
You a big
William Hung fan?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.545
Why does everybody
ask me that?

04:04.578 --> 04:05.646
Who the hell is that?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.920
I'm really excited
to meet your mom.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.688
You are?

04:14.722 --> 04:16.690
My mom is coming in
to visit.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.726
And she lives, like,
two hours away.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.361
And she doesn't
have a cellphone.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.630
Which is cool,
'cause it's kind of adding

04:22.663 --> 04:23.897
some suspense to my day.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.666
And I keep looking
over at the door,

04:25.699 --> 04:27.601
hoping she'll walk in.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.902
I'm excited
to show her around.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.505
She really wants
to meet everybody.

04:31.539 --> 04:32.506
Oh, yeah?
Good.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.807
'Cause I have
a lot of questions.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.443
Oh, really?
Yeah.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.546
As a child did Pam
show any traits

04:38.579 --> 04:39.713
that would hint towards
her future career

04:39.747 --> 04:42.783
as a receptionist?

04:42.816 --> 04:46.720
Hey, send me that link
to the monkey sex video.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.589
I'm going to forward it
like it's hot.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.757
Yes!

04:49.790 --> 04:50.791
* Forward it like it's hot

04:50.824 --> 04:52.626
* Forward it like it's hot

04:52.660 --> 04:54.428
Old school.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.963
Michael?

04:55.996 --> 04:57.798
Yes, Toby.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.600
Um, I need to talk to you
in your office.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.968
It'll just take two seconds.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.937
Um, literally two seconds?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.539
Toby is in HR,

05:05.573 --> 05:08.108
which technically means
he works for corporate.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.812
So he's really not
a part of our family.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.347
Also, he's divorced,

05:13.381 --> 05:15.616
so he's really not
a part of his family.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.551
The full story
is that Randall resigned

05:17.585 --> 05:18.919
because of
sexual harassment.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.088
So corporate asked me
to do a five minute review

05:21.121 --> 05:22.890
of the company's
sexual harassment policy.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.725
No, no, Toby.
No.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.759
It's really not
a big deal, Michael.

05:25.793 --> 05:26.760
It is a big deal.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.662
It's a big deal!

05:28.696 --> 05:29.797
What are we supposed to do,

05:29.830 --> 05:34.402
scrutinize every little thing
we say and do all day?

05:34.435 --> 05:35.403
I mean, come on.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.571
And then corporate
is gonna send in a lawyer.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.839
What?
No!

05:38.872 --> 05:41.041
Just to refresh you
on our policy.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.776
What?
N-he--no.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.746
Okay, what is a lawyer
gonna come in and tell us?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.648
To not send out

05:47.681 --> 05:50.484
hilarious emails
or not tell jokes?

05:50.518 --> 05:51.519
Maybe not some of them.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.920
Maybe not
inappropriate ones.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.689
There is no such thing
as an appropriate joke.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.425
That's why it's a joke.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.626
Everyone?
Hello?

05:58.659 --> 05:59.860
Everyone.
Hi.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.462
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.664
I know you're all busy
and the last thing you want

06:03.697 --> 06:05.933
is for a major
interruption.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.836
But Toby has an announcement
that he insists on making

06:08.869 --> 06:10.438
right now
in the middle of the day.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.939
So take it away.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.707
Yeah, okay.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.843
Corporate would like us
to do a five minute review

06:15.876 --> 06:17.645
of the company's
sexual harassment policy,

06:17.678 --> 06:18.979
so I'll go over that later.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.014
I wish you luck, Toby,
I really do.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.083
But you are going to have
a mutiny on your hands.

06:23.116 --> 06:26.654
And I just can't wait to see
how you handle it.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.723
A guy goes
to a five dollar...

06:29.757 --> 06:31.825
lady of the night.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.695
And he gets crabs.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.931
So the next day,
he goes back to complain.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.800
And the woman says,

06:39.833 --> 06:42.770
"Hey, it was only
five dollars.

06:42.803 --> 06:46.106
What did you expect,
lobster?"

06:47.941 --> 06:50.444
This is what's at stake.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.517
Time to bring out
the big guns.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.085
I am heading down
to the warehouse,

06:58.118 --> 06:59.820
where jokes are born.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.955
Find a killer joke
that'll just blow

07:01.989 --> 07:03.557
everybody away
at the seminar later.

07:03.591 --> 07:07.495
And remind them what is great
about this place.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.597
So...ah!
Here they are.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.999
Guys, wondering
if I could, uh,

07:12.032 --> 07:13.634
get your help for something?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.669
I am looking
for a new joke to tell.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.838
And it needs to be
just killer.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.073
And it does not
need to be clean.

07:20.107 --> 07:20.908
So what you got?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.643
Like, a joke?
A knock knock joke?

07:22.676 --> 07:23.811
Um, yeah--no.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.078
I mean, better.
Better than that.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.980
The type of stuff you guys
tell all day.

07:27.014 --> 07:31.719
Well, those are some
awful tight pants you have on.

07:31.752 --> 07:35.055
Where did you get 'em,
like, Queers 'R' Us?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.690
Boys 'R' Us.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.759
Oh!
All right, all right.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.661
Well, yeah,
but you know.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.030
A joke but not necessarily
at my expense.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.998
Man, we can see
all your business

07:45.032 --> 07:47.501
coming around the corner,
okay?

07:47.535 --> 07:48.502
You need to, you know,
hide that.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.037
Good thing you don't have
a lot of business

07:50.070 --> 07:51.271
to start with.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.674
Ohhhh, okay.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.808
That was still about me.

07:54.842 --> 07:55.976
Hey, hey, hey.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.177
So you don't have
the biggest package.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.812
Don't feel bad.
I don't feel bad.

07:58.846 --> 07:59.880
I think he feels bad.

07:59.913 --> 08:00.948
No, I don't.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.949
You look like
you feel bad.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.617
Okay, well...

08:03.651 --> 08:04.852
You know, not exactly
what I was looking for.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.587
But thanks, guys.
Thank you!

08:06.620 --> 08:07.588
You look good in those pants.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.756
He get it
from his mama!

08:11.692 --> 08:13.627
So, remember,
intent is irrelevant.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.696
And that's it.
Pam.

08:15.729 --> 08:19.667
Um, I just wanted to say
that--just,

08:19.700 --> 08:21.268
my mom's coming in today.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.803
Mmmmilf.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.805
Thanks, Kevin.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.274
Usually the day we talk about
sexual harassment

08:27.307 --> 08:30.277
is the day that everyone
harasses me as a joke.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.879
She's coming in today,
and maybe just don't joke

08:31.912 --> 08:33.647
around about that stuff
in front of her?

08:33.681 --> 08:34.915
Great point.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.685
Uh, in fact, uh,
basic rule of thumb.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.588
Let's just act every day
like Pam's mom is coming in.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.090
All right, that's it.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.758
If anybody has any questions
about anything,

08:44.792 --> 08:46.627
you know where I sit
in the back.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.798
Oh, is it over?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.165
Uh, yes.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.667
No.
I know, I know.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.268
It's good.
It is not over.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.871
It is not over
'til it's over.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.573
Did he tell you everything?

08:59.607 --> 09:00.874
Obviously he didn't,

09:00.908 --> 09:02.810
because you all still look
relatively happy,

09:02.843 --> 09:05.212
albeit bored.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.313
Do you realize
what we're losing?

09:06.346 --> 09:07.581
Seriously.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.649
Email forwards.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.851
Exactly.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.920
Can we afford to lose

09:12.953 --> 09:14.988
email forwards?
Do we want that?

09:15.022 --> 09:16.724
I hate them.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.659
You send me these
filthy emails.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.660
And you say,
"Forward them to 10 people,

09:19.693 --> 09:20.728
or you'll have bad luck."

09:22.062 --> 09:23.196
Give me a break.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.834
Um, Stanley how about
that hot picture

09:26.867 --> 09:28.368
you have by your desk?

09:28.401 --> 09:31.038
The centerfold in the
Catholic schoolgirl's outfit?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.006
I mean, it is hot,
it is sexy,

09:33.040 --> 09:34.307
and it turns him on.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.877
I will admit,
best part of my morning

09:36.910 --> 09:38.712
is staring at it.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.813
But what, are we just
gonna take it away?

09:39.847 --> 09:41.214
That is my daughter.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.050
She goes to Catholic
girl's school.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.719
I'm taking it down right now.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.087
Um, what about
office romance?

09:47.120 --> 09:51.358
Office relationships
are never a good idea,

09:51.391 --> 09:52.726
so let's just try
to avoid 'em.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.828
But if you already have one,

09:54.862 --> 09:56.129
you should disclose it
to HR.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.065
Um, all relationships?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.834
Even a one night stand?

10:00.868 --> 10:02.670
I think the old honor system
was fine.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.305
For example, I have never
slept with an employee.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.140
And believe me,
I could have.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.743
Yeah, Meredith.

10:09.777 --> 10:10.778
No, no, Catherine.
Remember her?

10:10.811 --> 10:11.945
Remember how hot she was?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.681
She would have definitely
slept with me.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.848
She wasn't that hot.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.851
Yes, she was.
Dammit, Kevin!

10:17.885 --> 10:20.788
I'm in an office relationship.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.889
It's special.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.091
Mmm, she's nice,
she's shy.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.826
She's actually here
if you wanna meet her.

10:25.859 --> 10:29.396
Hold on a second.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.932
Oh, my God.
Put on a shirt!

10:31.965 --> 10:34.768
Put--I told you
that you'd be on camera.

10:34.802 --> 10:35.936
I'm sorry, she's European.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.339
No, I told you
that you'd be on camera.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.741
Stop.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.010
What if Pam was a lesbian?

10:44.177 --> 10:47.347
What if she brought
her "partner" into work?

10:47.380 --> 10:48.716
Would that be
crossing the line?

10:48.749 --> 10:49.783
No.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.019
What if they made out
in front of everybody?

10:52.052 --> 10:54.121
Well, that would be--
At home?

10:54.154 --> 10:57.024
And I told everybody
everything about it?

10:58.225 --> 10:59.192
Okay, I'm lost.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.260
Okay.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.461
Well, then,
let's act it out.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.130
Pam, you will be girl A.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.299
And girl B will be...

11:06.333 --> 11:09.202
Okay, we'll use the doll.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.337
Pam?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.373
Pam?

11:16.476 --> 11:19.212
I wish Todd Packer was here,
'cause he would love this.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.114
I wonder if anybody else
would like to join us.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.750
Oop.
Coming out of my mouth.

11:22.783 --> 11:26.754
Hey, um,
we have to watch Toby's video

11:26.787 --> 11:27.855
that he's showing us

11:27.888 --> 11:28.956
in order to brainwash us.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.324
And I was wondering
if anybody'd like to join in?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.760
Gonna be fun.

11:32.793 --> 11:33.794
Got microwave pizza.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.996
What do you say?
Jim?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.130
No, thanks, I'm good.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.300
That's what she said.
Pam?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.770
Um, my mother's coming.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.304
That's what she said--

11:44.337 --> 11:46.139
No, but--okay.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.207
Well, suit yourself.

11:48.942 --> 11:49.910
Hey, Toby.

11:49.943 --> 11:50.744
Hey, Dwight.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.813
You said that we could
come to you

11:52.846 --> 11:53.981
if we had any questions.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.148
Sure.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.887
Where is the clitoris?

12:03.857 --> 12:10.530
On a website it said
on the crest of the labia.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.767
What does that mean?

12:15.402 --> 12:18.371
What does the female vagina
look like?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.808
Technically, I am
in human resources.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.944
And Dwight was asking
about human anatomy.

12:23.977 --> 12:28.348
Um, I'm just sad
the public school system

12:28.381 --> 12:30.884
failed him so badly.

12:30.918 --> 12:31.684
You know,
maybe when you get

12:31.718 --> 12:33.821
really comfortable
with each other,

12:33.854 --> 12:36.256
you can ask for that.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.826
Good.

12:38.859 --> 12:39.827
Good.
And--

12:39.860 --> 12:41.494
I should get back to work.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.063
Okay.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.232
In today's fast paced
business climate,

12:45.265 --> 12:47.067
it can sometimes
to hard to know

12:47.100 --> 12:50.804
when a comment or an action
crosses the line.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.472
Let's take a look
at a couple of scenarios

12:52.505 --> 12:53.506
and ask ourselves,

12:53.540 --> 12:56.443
where is the line?

12:58.245 --> 12:59.579
The natural redhead.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.580
Hey, Marie.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.549
Hey, Joe, Mike.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.851
Hey, settle a bet.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.453
Are you a natural redhead?

13:07.921 --> 13:10.390
Oh my--ay, stop the video!

13:10.423 --> 13:12.059
Wait, go--stop it right there.
Stop it right there.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.364
That's that girl
from that thing.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.498
I banged this girl
right here.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.332
That's her?

13:19.366 --> 13:20.834
Yes, this is the one.
You remember...

13:20.868 --> 13:22.435
No, the party?
You banged her?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.604
Right here.
You are a naughty girl.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.605
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.140
Okay, hypocrite.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.541
Okay, she is a hypocrite.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.911
That is such a scam.
Okay.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.312
Yes?

13:32.345 --> 13:34.114
Yes, I did.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.348
Okay.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.117
Well, we can talk
about that later then.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.251
Okay, you are never
gonna believe this.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.552
The girl in the video

13:39.586 --> 13:40.988
we're watching
that corporate gave us.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.255
Darryl banged her!

13:45.358 --> 13:47.861
And...

13:47.895 --> 13:51.031
He's about 90% sure.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.235
Don't ever let this
little bitch

13:55.268 --> 13:56.369
drive you around town.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.604
We got lost
for half an hour.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.572
I don't have any DUIs,
so l can drive myself.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.008
But thanks.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.642
Where is Michael Snot?

14:02.675 --> 14:05.612
Sniffing some dude's thong?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.981
Probably.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.984
So you are the lawyer,
Mr. O'Malley.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.385
I know a lot
of lawyer jokes.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.653
I love lawyer jokes.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.589
Well, it's probably because
you don't get 'em.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.591
When I said before
that I was king of forwards,

14:18.625 --> 14:20.961
you gotta understand
that I don't

14:20.994 --> 14:22.329
come up with this stuff.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.498
I just forward it along.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.467
You wouldn't arrest a guy
who's just delivering drugs

14:27.500 --> 14:29.469
from one guy to another.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.038
You seem a little bit
agitated, Michael.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.105
What's the problem?

14:32.139 --> 14:35.342
The problem is that...

14:35.375 --> 14:36.643
I am the boss.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.111
And apparently
I can't say anything.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.183
Well, that's--that's true
in a way.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.685
You can't say "anything."

14:45.718 --> 14:46.954
Where's the line?

14:46.987 --> 14:47.887
Where's the line, Jan?

14:47.921 --> 14:49.589
Do you need to see
the video again, Michael?

14:49.622 --> 14:51.191
No, I've seen the video.
He talked the whole time.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.526
No, I didn't.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.929
What?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.502
Attention, everyone.
Hello?

15:02.535 --> 15:04.972
Uh, yes, I just want you
to know that, uh,

15:05.005 --> 15:06.039
this is not my decision.

15:06.073 --> 15:11.144
But from here on out,
we can no longer be friends.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.348
And when we talk about
things here,

15:15.382 --> 15:20.087
we must only discuss
work associated things.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.523
And you can consider this
my retirement from comedy.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.460
And in the future, if I want
to say something funny,

15:27.494 --> 15:29.662
or witty,
or do an impression,

15:29.696 --> 15:34.167
I will no longer ever
do any of those things.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.404
Does that include,
"That's what she said"?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.140
Mm-hmm, yes.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.109
Wow, that is really hard.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.378
Do you really think
you can go all day long?

15:48.281 --> 15:51.184
Well, you always left me
satisfied and smiling, so...

15:53.086 --> 15:54.487
That's what she said!

15:54.521 --> 15:55.488
Michael...

15:55.522 --> 15:56.523
Michael!

15:56.556 --> 15:59.059
Michael, please.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.129
Come on!

16:02.162 --> 16:03.296
You would have done the same.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.597
You just didn't
think of it first.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.633
Mi-Michael, please.
I-I--really.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.235
That's not
my sense of humor.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.502
Okay.
Hello.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.238
Jan, Mr. O'Malley,

16:11.271 --> 16:14.174
this is my lawyer
James P. Albini.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.775
I believe you may
recognize his face

16:15.808 --> 16:17.677
from the billboards.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.213
He specializes
in free speech issues.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.482
And motorcycle head injuries,
worker's comp,

16:22.515 --> 16:24.284
and diet pill lawsuits.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.352
This guy does it all.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.154
Excuse me,
I'm sorry.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.222
Michael, Mr. O'Malley
is your lawyer.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.059
What?

16:32.092 --> 16:34.627
Mr. O'Malley
is our corporate lawyer.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.264
We have him on retainer
to protect the company,

16:37.297 --> 16:39.132
as well as upper level
management

16:39.166 --> 16:40.200
such as yourself.

16:42.635 --> 16:43.736
So I'm not in trouble?

16:43.770 --> 16:46.639
I am so used to being
the bad boy.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.542
I am so used
to fighting corporate

16:49.576 --> 16:51.211
that I forget
that I am corporate.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.813
Upper management.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.116
They hooked me up
with an attorney.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.086
To protect me.

16:59.119 --> 17:02.189
You can't be too careful
about what you say.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.624
Mo' money, mo' problems.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.794
Okay, well, let's get you
out of here, James.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.429
Um, I think
we're under an hour still.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.564
Yeah, but I did a lot
of paperwork at home.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.765
We'll talk about it later.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.033
Thanks for coming in.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.173
Um, hello.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.708
Oh, my God!

17:21.741 --> 17:23.143
I finally made it.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.244
Hello!

17:24.277 --> 17:26.513
I love my mom.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.383
Okay, that's probably the
most obvious statement ever.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.784
This is all yours?

17:31.818 --> 17:32.852
Yeah, I am in charge
of this whole area.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.654
Oh, my goodness.
That's great.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.397
So a guy goes home,
tells his wife,

17:44.431 --> 17:46.499
"Honey, pack your bags,
I just won the lottery."

17:46.533 --> 17:48.335
She goes, "Oh, my God.
That's incredible.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.636
Where are we going?"

17:49.669 --> 17:50.870
He goes, "I don't know
where you're going,

17:50.903 --> 17:52.805
just be out of here by five."

17:56.409 --> 17:57.744
Boom!

17:57.777 --> 18:00.113
This is where
I used to keep my computer.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.514
Oh, right, I remember.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.716
With the picture, yeah.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.585
But I switched stuff around
because I actually needed,

18:05.618 --> 18:08.155
like, more room
for organization.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.523
This is, like, um...

18:10.557 --> 18:13.160
Oh, there he is.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.727
How are you?
Hey, handsome.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.563
You look great.
Oh, thank you.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.665
So, we ready for dinner?

18:18.698 --> 18:20.733
Well, you know,
actually I kind of need to

18:20.767 --> 18:21.734
stall a bit.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.270
But it's okay,

18:23.303 --> 18:25.638
because I am very used
to killing time.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.639
Oh, I don't believe that.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.675
Okay, I'm gonna go wait
in the parking lot.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.910
And what kind of tunes
do you want for the ride?

18:30.943 --> 18:33.180
A little classical,
a little oldies?

18:33.213 --> 18:35.182
Oh, anything is fine.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.284
All right,
we'll see ya.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.654
So which one is Jim?

18:41.688 --> 18:43.723
Mom!

18:43.756 --> 18:44.857
I just wanted to know.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.659
No, it's...
All right, okay.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.795
10 minutes,
then we can go to dinner.

18:48.828 --> 18:49.696
I'll make myself busy.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.863
There's this guy,

18:50.897 --> 18:52.699
he's at a nymphomaniac
convention.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.801
And he is psyched,

18:54.834 --> 18:56.503
'cause all these woman
are smoking hot perfect 10s,

18:56.536 --> 18:58.571
except for this one chick
who looks a lot like...

18:58.605 --> 19:00.740
Phyllis?
Yeah.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.542
No, no, no.
That crosses the line.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.576
Ex

19:05.612 --> 19:07.480
Not you.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.650
Kevin.
Just unwarranted.

19:10.683 --> 19:11.651
Hostile work environment,
Kevin.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.186
Packer said it.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.721
No, you said it.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.889
He pointed.
A point is not a say.

19:16.923 --> 19:21.194
Look, Kevin,
we are a family here.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.929
And Phyllis is a valued
member of that family.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.264
Like a grandmother.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.365
I'm the same age
as you, Michael.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.533
I don't know about that.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.667
We're the same
high school class.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.601
Well, I have a late birthday

19:28.635 --> 19:31.404
and usually September
is a cut off point...

19:31.438 --> 19:32.405
You know what?

19:32.439 --> 19:34.707
You just crossed the line,
okay?

19:34.741 --> 19:36.743
There is a line
and you went over it.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.346
And you must be punished.
So go to your corner.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.748
You mean
where my desk is?

19:41.781 --> 19:42.882
Yes, your corner.
Go.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.917
Okay.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.819
I have a lot of work
to do, anyway.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.521
Oh, my.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.889
They really got to you,
didn't they?

19:49.922 --> 19:52.959
They didn't get to me.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.561
I got to them.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.666
I am still
the same old Michael Scott.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.602
New and improved.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.770
You know what?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.505
I love Phyllis.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.342
You know what else?

20:09.376 --> 20:11.478
I think she is gorgeous.

20:11.511 --> 20:16.616
I think she is an incredibly,
incredibly attractive person.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.617
Come here.
Give me a kiss.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.785
Come on.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.453
Michael, come on,
you don't have to worry.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.821
I'm not gonna...
I'm not worried.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.291
report you to HR.
You know what?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.593
The only thing
I am worried about

20:26.626 --> 20:28.728
is getting a boner.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.464
Good work today,
everybody.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.371
Times have changed
a little.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.741
And even though
we're still a family here

20:41.774 --> 20:45.412
at Dunder Mifflin,
families grow.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.779
And at some point,

20:46.813 --> 20:51.618
the daddy can't take a bath
with the kids anymore.

20:51.651 --> 20:52.485
I am upper management.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.655
And it would be inappropriate
for me

20:55.688 --> 20:57.957
to take a bath
with Pam.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.992
As much as I
might want to.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.494
He said what?

21:01.528 --> 21:04.531
