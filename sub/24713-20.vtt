ELSE, THE DRUGS ARE HERS.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.763
I'LL GET HER LODGED
DOWNSTAIRS.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.728
HI. I'M KATIE MEDAVOY,
HERE TO SEE MY DAD.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.022
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.023
THANK YOU.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.233
MAY I SEE THE RING?
SURE.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.236
OH. A NICE SIMPLE BAND
WITH LITTLE BAGUETTES.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.572
IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WHO NEEDS
A BIG DIAMOND, RIGHT?

10:56.572 --> 10:59.116
YEAH, I REALLY LOVE IT.
IS MY DAD AROUND?

10:59.116 --> 11:01.786
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
HE'S IN THE COFFEE ROOM.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.704
IT'S RIGHT THROUGH THERE.

11:03.704 --> 11:04.997
OKAY, THANKS.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.712
HEY.
HEY, DAD.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.632
I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT TRYING ON
DRESSES WITH YOUR MOM.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.509
OH, WE ENDED A LITTLE EARLY.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.220
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.347
[ Sighs ] WHAT'S WRONG?

11:21.347 --> 11:23.974
MOM'S NOT GOING TO COME
TO THE WEDDING NOW.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.893
SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT,

11:25.893 --> 11:28.229
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW
SHE'D REACT.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.356
BECAUSE I'LL BE THERE?

11:30.356 --> 11:31.774
YEAH.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.819
I CAN'T BELIEVE HER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.821
SO I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH KEVIN,

11:36.821 --> 11:39.907
AND I TOLD HIM THAT I THINK
IT MIGHT BE A LOT EASIER

11:39.907 --> 11:42.284
IF WE JUST ELOPE.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.287
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE TO ELOPE.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.165
HAVE YOUR WEDDING,
'CAUSE IT'S YOUR DAY.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.626
I JUST DON'T WANT
ANY PROBLEMS.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.212
LET YOUR MOTHER COME.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.756
I-I'LL TAKE YOU AND KEVIN OUT
TO DINNER BEFORE THE WEDDING.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.633
WE'LL HAVE OUR OWN
CELEBRATION.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.636
WELL, YOU SAY THIS NOW, BUT YOU
MIGHT BE REALLY UPSET LATER.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.222
THE ONLY THING
THAT WOULD UPSET ME

12:03.222 --> 12:06.892
IS IF YOU HAVE TO ELOPE
ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR PARENTS.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.644
HAVE YOUR WEDDING.

12:08.644 --> 12:11.230
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO TRY
AND GET YOU TO SAY THAT.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.566
I KNOW.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.026
THANK YOU.

12:16.026 --> 12:20.239
THANK YOU FOR JUST MAKING
MY LIFE A LOT EASIER.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.158
ANYTHING I CAN DO.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.679
IF WE HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS,
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.514
THANKS
FOR YOUR HELP.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.392
THAT WAS CHIEF OF POLICE
UP IN GLEN FALLS.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.478
THAT WOMAN WE CAUGHT WITH
A HALF KEY OF COKE ON HER --

12:50.478 --> 12:52.396
THAT'S WHERE SHE LIVES.
SHE HAVE A RECORD?

12:52.396 --> 12:54.523
NOTHING, BUT SHE DOES HAVE
A DIRTBAG SON

12:54.523 --> 12:57.485
WHO HAD A RECORD UP THERE
UNTIL THEY RAN HIM OUT OF TOWN

12:57.485 --> 12:59.487
AND WHO NOW LIVES
IN OUR FAIR CITY.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.113
IS SHE MULING
FOR HER SON?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.073
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE FAXING OVER

13:03.073 --> 13:05.326
HER SON'S SHEET,
AND I'LL GO HIT HER UP.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.084
SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

13:14.084 --> 13:16.712
NOTHING.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.881
I WENT HOME
AFTER THE BAR,

13:18.881 --> 13:21.133
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE FIGHT,
AND I WAS STILL WORKED UP,

13:21.133 --> 13:25.137
SO I COULDN'T SLEEP.
NOTHING HAPPENED WITH NOTHING.

13:25.137 --> 13:29.183
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE REST
OF OUR DOA's CLIENT LIST?

13:29.183 --> 13:33.813
OH. UM, ROB McCARTHY'S
A SCRATCH NOW,

13:33.813 --> 13:37.608
AND, UH, GREG'S BRINGING IN
THIS GUY DAVE BURGESS.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.986
THANKS,
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.072
YOUR GUY'S IN THE POKEY.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.324
DID YOU GET ANY HIT
OFF HIM?

13:45.324 --> 13:47.117
NAH. PRETTY QUIET.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.750
HEY, JUST CALL YOUR EX,

13:54.750 --> 13:56.877
AND TELL HER TO GET HER HEAD
OUT OF HER ASS.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.631
THAT'S JUST WHAT SHE WANTS --
A SCENE.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.675
I GOT TO LET IT GO.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.718
I WANT KATIE TO HAVE
A GOOD WEDDING.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.303
I OWE HER THAT.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.681
YOU KNOW
A SHERI LENT, DAVE?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.307
YEAH, I KNOW SHERI, YEAH.

14:10.307 --> 14:11.308
HOW?

14:11.308 --> 14:14.186
PARTY TOGETHER SOMETIMES.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.187
GET HIGH.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.231
YEAH, YOU KNOW, WEED.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.440
SHERI YOUR DEALER?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.234
I-I DON'T WANT
TO GET HER IN TROUBLE.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.569
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION

14:21.569 --> 14:22.862
OR YOU'RE GOING
TO GET YOURSELF IN TROUBLE.

14:22.862 --> 14:27.241
YEAH, I BOUGHT POT
OFF SHERI BEFORE, YEAH.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.951
WERE YOU SLEEPING
WITH HER?

14:28.951 --> 14:31.912
NO. NO, I MEAN, SHE WASN'T
NO DOG OR NOTHING,

14:31.912 --> 14:33.080
BUT IT WAS
JUST A POT DEAL.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.415
WHEN DID YOU
SEE HER LAST?

14:34.415 --> 14:35.791
YESTERDAY.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.167
WHAT FOR?

14:37.167 --> 14:38.878
TO BUY POT.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.046
I-I'M NOT GETTING HER
IN TROUBLE HERE, AM I?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.548
WHO ELSE
WAS AT HER APARTMENT?

14:42.548 --> 14:43.799
NOBODY.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.384
SHE DIDN'T HAVE FRIENDS
STAYING WITH HER?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.469
NO, I WAS THERE
FOR, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES.

14:47.469 --> 14:48.846
THERE WAS
NO ONE ELSE AROUND.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.180
YOU GOT A JOB?

14:50.180 --> 14:51.515
YES.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.684
I-I WORK FOR MARK DOUGLAS --
COMMERCIAL PAINTER.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.770
I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR MARK
ALMOST THREE MONTHS NOW.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.689
WHERE YOU BEEN TODAY?

14:58.689 --> 14:59.982
DAY OFF,

14:59.982 --> 15:02.067
BUT I WENT BY TO PICK UP
MY CHECK FROM MARK,

15:02.067 --> 15:03.819
AND THEN I RODE AROUND
WITH HIM FOR A BIT

15:03.819 --> 15:05.821
WHILE HE WAS OFF BIDDING
ON SOME OTHER JOBS.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.156
HOW LONG
WERE YOU WITH HIM?

15:07.156 --> 15:11.493
UM, 7:00 A.M.
TILL, LIKE, 10:00.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.120
I-I DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE,

15:13.120 --> 15:14.288
BUT WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

15:14.288 --> 15:16.790
SHERI'S NAME CAME UP
IN AN INVESTIGATION.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.126
OH. I'M NOT TRYING
TO GET HER IN TROUBLE.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.378
WRITE DOWN
YOUR BOSS'S NUMBER

15:21.378 --> 15:24.048
SO WE CAN VERIFY
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN TODAY.

15:24.048 --> 15:28.469
YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT POT IS
STILL CLASSIFIED AS A NARCOTIC

15:28.469 --> 15:30.387
UNDER FEDERAL LAW
IS RIDICULOUS.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.972
HOW MANY CRIMES
DO YOU SEE COMMITTED

15:31.972 --> 15:33.849
BY PEOPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF POT, RIGHT?

15:33.849 --> 15:35.809
YOU GOT A RECORD, DAVE?
YOU DONE ANY TIME?

15:35.809 --> 15:37.353
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.904
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
PLEASE LET ME OUT OF HERE.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.324
YOU'VE BEEN IN A CELL
FOR TWO HOURS.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.617
IMAGINE 15 YEARS IN HERE.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.994
NO.
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING AT.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.537
THOSE WEREN'T MY DRUGS.

15:55.537 --> 15:56.789
ARE THEY YOUR SON'S?

15:56.789 --> 15:57.831
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

15:57.831 --> 15:59.416
ARE THEY ERIC'S?

15:59.416 --> 16:01.418
NO.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.754
YOU'RE IN TOWN FOR THE DAY.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.673
YOUR SON, WHO HAS PREVIOUS
DRUG CONVICTIONS, LIVES HERE.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.049
YOU'RE CAUGHT WITH DRUGS.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.676
IT'S STARTING TO LINE UP
FOR US.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.219
ERIC'S A GOOD BOY.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.595
WE'RE SURE HE IS.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.639
HE FELL
INTO THE WRONG CROWD

16:13.639 --> 16:15.474
AFTER HIS DAD LEFT.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.851
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
AND WE'LL GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.895
NO, HE CAN'T
GO BACK TO JAIL.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.772
WE'LL DO OUR BEST
TO GET HIM IN A PROGRAM.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.613
HE GAVE ME THE PACKAGE.

16:29.613 --> 16:33.450
IT WAS GIFT-WRAPPED.
HE SAID IT WAS A PRESENT

16:33.450 --> 16:36.036
FOR DAN, THIS FRIEND OF HIS
UP IN GLEN FALLS.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.955
DID YOU KNOW THERE WERE
DRUGS IN THE PACKAGE?

16:37.955 --> 16:39.498
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.000
WRITE DOWN
WHERE TO FIND ERIC.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.501
SIT DOWN.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.757
OUR GUY IN THE POKEY
DAVE BURGESS --

16:48.757 --> 16:50.217
HIS ALIBI STICKS.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.553
HIS BOSS CONFIRMS HE CAME BY
TO GET HIS CHECK AT 7:00 SHARP,

16:52.553 --> 16:53.804
HUNG OUT TILL 10:00.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.347
HIS BOSS SAYS
HE'S A GOOD WORKER,

16:55.347 --> 16:56.682
BUT HALF WACKY.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.850
I RAN HIS NAME.
THERE'S A DAVID BURGESS,

16:57.850 --> 16:59.977
SAME DATE OF BIRTH,
WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

16:59.977 --> 17:03.647
FOR AN ARSON IN TOPEKA, KANSAS,
FIVE YEARS AGO.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.065
GET HIM PRINTED
AND COMPARE IT?

17:05.065 --> 17:06.483
YEAH.
NEED HELP?

17:06.483 --> 17:08.485
NO, I GOT IT.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.036
WHERE ARE YOU FROM
ORIGINALLY, DAVE?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.912
ALL OVER.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.998
MY DAD WAS A TRUCKER,
KEPT MOVING THE FAMILY.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.583
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF?

17:22.583 --> 17:24.710
YOU EVER SPEND TIME
IN TOPEKA?

17:24.710 --> 17:25.753
KANSAS?

17:25.753 --> 17:26.962
YEAH.
NO.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.089
THERE'S AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT
IN TOPEKA

17:29.089 --> 17:31.341
FOR A DAVID BURGESS,
SAME DATE OF BIRTH

17:31.341 --> 17:33.177
AS YOU GOT LISTED
ON YOUR NEW YORK LICENSE.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.220
IT'S NOT ME.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.015
WELL, NOTHING PERSONAL,
BUT WE GOT TO FIND OUT FOR SURE.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.266
OH.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.310
OH, HEY,
WHAT IT COULD BE --

17:41.310 --> 17:43.479
I WAS A VICTIM
OF AN IDENTITY THEFT.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.647
THIS GUY GOT HOLD OF MY NAME,
MY VITAL STATISTICS,

17:45.647 --> 17:47.483
AND BASICALLY RACKED UP
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN MY NAME

17:47.483 --> 17:50.027
AND DID WHO KNOWS WHAT
KIND OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.071
I-I'M STILL GETTING CALLS
BECAUSE OF HIM.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.782
ALL RIGHT, SO, UH,
WHAT WE GOT TO DO, THEN,

17:54.782 --> 17:56.116
IS TAKE YOU DOWN
TO FINGERPRINT YOU.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.451
NO, IT WASN'T ME.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.036
THIS IS STANDARD PROCEDURE.
IT'LL TAKE A FEW MINUTES

17:59.036 --> 18:01.371
TO PROVE IT'S NOT YOU,
THEN YOU'LL BE ON YOUR WAY.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.460
YOU --
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
NOTHING BUT NICE TO YOU GUYS.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.462
I'VE BEEN NOTHING
BUT COOPERATIVE,

18:08.462 --> 18:10.506
AND I GET STANDARD PROCEDURE
IN RETURN.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.882
RELAX, DAVE.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.050
I AM RELAXED,

18:13.050 --> 18:14.843
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO GO HOME NOW

18:14.843 --> 18:16.220
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN
NOTHING BUT NICE TO YOU.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.679
WELL, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO PRINT YOU FIRST,

18:17.679 --> 18:20.182
AND THEN
YOU CAN GO HOME.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.141
COME ON.

18:27.898 --> 18:28.982
TAKE IT EASY.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.776
SIT DOWN AND PUT
YOUR HANDS ON THE TABLE!

18:30.776 --> 18:32.152
WE'RE GOING
TO WORK THIS OUT, DAVE.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.113
I WAS SO NICE TO YOU.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.198
YOU STILL ARE NICE.
SO AM I.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.200
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU ARE NOT!

18:38.200 --> 18:40.869
YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME GO.
YOU HAPPY NOW?

18:40.869 --> 18:41.912
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO WORK OUT.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.163
SHUT UP!

18:48.877 --> 18:50.921
THAT WAS MEDAVOY
AND JONES.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.381
THE FEMALE
SHOT AT THE APARTMENT

18:52.381 --> 18:54.466
SAID A JAMAICAN NAMED ED
WAS THE SHOOTER.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.552
I'LL SEE
WHAT NARCOTICS HAS ON THAT.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.345
NO LUCK FINDING
THIS WOMAN'S SON.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.848
THE SON WHO PLANTED
THE DRUGS ON HER?
YEAH.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.976
WE NOTIFIED THE SECTOR CARS
TO KEEP AN EYE OUT.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.561
WHERE --
WHERE'S ANDY?

19:05.561 --> 19:08.105
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING
THIS GUY DOWN AND GET PRINTED.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.106
I DON'T KNOW.
LET ME CHECK.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.153
AHEM.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.612
ANDY.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.281
Andy: DON'T COME
IN HERE, JOHN.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.658
YOU ALL RIGHT?

19:19.658 --> 19:20.951
Dave: DON'T YOU LISTEN?
DON'T COME IN HERE.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.871
WHEN I'M READY TO TALK
TO YOU GUYS, I WILL.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.347
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

19:42.347 --> 19:44.349
I DON'T KNOW.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.437
HOW'D HE GET ANDY'S GUN?

19:48.437 --> 19:50.439
THAT'S NOT ANDY'S GUN.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.149
THE GUY'S HOLDING
A SILVER AUTOMATIC.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.174
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS GUY?

20:17.174 --> 20:19.009
HE'S WANTED
FOR AN ARSON IN KANSAS.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.510
THAT'S IT.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.179
HAS HE GOT FAMILY
THAT COULD TALK TO HIM?

20:22.179 --> 20:23.680
WE'RE LOOKING
AT ALL THAT.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.098
WE GOT BROOKLYN DETECTIVES

20:25.098 --> 20:26.308
WHO ARE GOING THROUGH
HIS APARTMENT RIGHT NOW.

DETECTIVE ORTIZ?

20:29.853 --> 20:32.648
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS.
HE HASN'T ASKED FOR ANYTHING?

20:32.648 --> 20:34.900
THE NEGOTIATOR'S
TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.110
THIS WAY.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.528
OKAY. THANKS.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.948

THEY'RE BRINGING HIM IN.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.959

YOU CAN DO HERE.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.217

21:04.263 --> 21:05.681
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.557
GREG, WHEN YOU BROUGHT
THIS GUY IN,

21:07.557 --> 21:09.184
DIDN'T YOU TOSS HIM?

21:09.184 --> 21:12.312
I-I COULD HAVE
SWORE I DID.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.939
HE'S GOT A SMALL AUTOMATIC
IN THERE.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.148
THAT'S NOT ANDY'S GUN.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.818
GOD, I-I DON'T KNOW.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.278
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING BACK IN THERE.

KEEP WORKING THE CASE.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.657

IN THE POKEY'S INVOLVED SOMEHOW?

21:27.077 --> 21:28.662
EITHER YOU WORK IT
OR I'LL ASSIGN IT

21:28.662 --> 21:30.455
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?

21:30.455 --> 21:33.292
THAT'S WHAT
IT'S GOT TO BE.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.168

A JAMAICAN NAMED ED

21:35.168 --> 21:36.837
AS THE SHOOTER?
YEAH.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.422
GET ON IT.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.387
IT'S ALL RIGHT, GREG.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.600
I DIDN'T SET FIRE
TO THE MAN'S HOUSE.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.935
WAS I IN THE VICINITY?

21:51.935 --> 21:54.479
YEAH. YEAH, I WAS,
BUT I DID NOT SET FIRE TO IT.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.064
WHO DID
SET FIRE TO IT?

21:56.064 --> 21:57.482
DON'T YOU THINK
IF I KNEW

21:57.482 --> 22:00.027
I WOULD HAVE PRESENTED
THAT INFORMATION TO THE POLICE?

22:00.027 --> 22:01.737

BEING ACCUSED

22:01.737 --> 22:02.738

I DIDN'T COMMIT?

22:02.738 --> 22:04.072
WHOSE HOUSE WAS IT?

22:04.072 --> 22:06.616
OKAY, WELL, THIS IS
WHY PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS ME,

22:06.616 --> 22:09.328
BECAUSE THE GUY
WHO OWNED THE HOUSE --

22:09.328 --> 22:10.370
I DIDN'T LIKE HIM.
HE WAS GARBAGE.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.663
HEY, YOU THERE?

22:11.663 --> 22:13.582
SHUT UP!

22:13.582 --> 22:15.751
HE STOLE AN IDEA FROM ME
THAT I PATENTED,

22:15.751 --> 22:18.086
AND NOW HE GOES ON
AND MAKES MONEY OFF THE PRODUCT,

22:18.086 --> 22:19.338
LEAVING ME WHAT?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.048

ON TOP OF ALL THIS,

22:25.385 --> 22:26.928
HE TURNS IT ON ME.

22:26.928 --> 22:28.680
HE GETS A RESTRAINING ORDER
ON ME,

22:28.680 --> 22:29.806
PAINTS ME

TO TALK ABOUT, DAVE?

23:28.031 --> 23:29.032

ON YOUR MOM.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.242

IN CUSTODY.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.451
WHAT DRUGS?

23:31.451 --> 23:33.286
THE COKE AND ECSTASY

23:33.286 --> 23:35.205
AND TOLD HER TO HAND OVER
TO YOUR FRIEND DAN

23:35.205 --> 23:36.790
WHEN SHE GOT BACK
TO GLEN FALLS.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.417
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.918
THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S GOING
TO WORK TODAY, ERIC.

OR YOUR MOM'S,

23:48.051 --> 23:49.469
SO YOUR 45-YEAR-OLD MOM
WITH NO RECORD

23:49.469 --> 23:53.181

A PACKAGE TO TAKE UPSTATE.

23:53.181 --> 23:56.518
I GUESS SO.
SHE'S UP IN THE SUBURBS
DEALING COKE AND ECSTASY.

23:56.518 --> 23:57.519
I DON'T KNOW.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.937

23:58.937 --> 24:00.981

24:04.818 --> 24:06.403
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

TOLD YOU NEVER TO COME BACK,

YOU'VE HIT SOME HARD TIMES,

24:23.336 --> 24:25.213
AND YOU'VE PROBABLY DONE THINGS
YOU WISH YOU COULD DO OVER,

24:25.213 --> 24:26.965
BUT DON'T SELL OUT YOUR MOM.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.050
DON'T DO IT TO HER,
DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.261
I WOULD STAND UP FOR HER
IF I DID THIS,

24:31.261 --> 24:32.721
BUT I DIDN'T.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.015
MAYBE SHE'S GOT A HABIT
OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.976
CAN I GO?

24:37.976 --> 24:39.478
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.691
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:44.691 --> 24:47.611
THE PERP AND DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ
ARE TALKING.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.446
THE PERP'S NOT DEALING
WITH THE NEGOTIATOR.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.031
CAN WE LOOK IN THROUGH
THE OBSERVATION ROOM YET?

24:51.031 --> 24:53.074

JUST DIED.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.918
AIN'T NOTHING FROM NARCOTICS
ON ANY JAMAICAN NAMED ED?

25:02.918 --> 25:06.338
THAT WAS TARU.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.132
THE DOA MALE AT THE APARTMENT
GLENN GURTIN --

25:09.132 --> 25:11.510
THEY DUMPED HIS CELL PHONE,
AND THERE WAS A CALL OUT

25:11.510 --> 25:15.138
TO AN ED BRODY,
JAMAICA, QUEENS.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.015
RUNNING AROUND LOOKING
FOR A JAMAICAN.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.643
HE'S GOT A RECORD
AND A MUG SHOT YOU CAN PICK UP.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.694
OKAY, TONY,
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

25:29.694 --> 25:30.946
OKAY.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.033
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US
A LITTLE ROOM?

25:35.033 --> 25:36.785
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.537
LET US DO OUR JOB.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.081
IT'S MY COMMAND, MY DETECTIVE
IN THERE. I'M STAYING.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.582
SO JUST ACCEPT THAT
AND DON'T WASTE TIME

25:42.582 --> 25:44.167
TURNING THIS
INTO A PISSING MATCH.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.627
Dave: JUST KEEP
YOUR HANDS ON THE TABLE.

25:45.627 --> 25:46.962
WHAT DO YOU WANT, DAVE?

25:46.962 --> 25:49.506
I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.092
THIS IS HOW YOU GO ABOUT
WANTING TO BE LEFT ALONE?

25:52.092 --> 25:54.427
YOU BROUGHT ME IN HERE,

25:54.427 --> 25:57.389
AND I ANSWERED YOUR STUPID
QUESTIONS ABOUT BUYING POT.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.390
YOU COULD HAVE LET ME GO.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.391
DAVE, WE GOT TO TALK,
BUDDY.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.600
DAMN IT!

26:00.600 --> 26:03.478
BACK OFF! I'M NOT GOING
TO SAY IT AGAIN.

26:03.478 --> 26:04.938
YOU SHOULD HAVE
LET ME GO.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.649
YOU SHOULD HAVE
LET ME GO.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.485
LET'S TRY AND FOCUS
ON WHAT WE CAN DO NOW.

26:10.485 --> 26:14.447
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF THEY GOT A HOLD OF ME,

26:14.447 --> 26:17.075
THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN,
THE THINGS I KNOW?

26:17.075 --> 26:20.120
I COULD PULL THE RUG OUT FROM
UNDER THIS ENTIRE GOVERNMENT,

26:20.120 --> 26:21.246
AND THEY KNOW IT.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.914
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

26:22.914 --> 26:24.583
YOU DON'T CARE.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.792
NO, I DO CARE.

26:25.792 --> 26:29.546
DON'T YOU LIE TO ME!
DON'T YOU LIE TO ME!

26:29.546 --> 26:31.131
NOW, THE ONLY REASON
THAT YOU ARE STILL ALIVE

26:31.131 --> 26:34.217
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
TRIED TO LIE TO ME LIKE THAT --

26:34.217 --> 26:37.053
THAT ASSHOLE OUT THERE AND
PRETEND YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.305
DAVE...

26:38.305 --> 26:41.057
I WANT TO WALK OUT OF HERE,

26:41.057 --> 26:44.269
SO I'M NOT LYING
WHEN I SAY I CARE.

26:44.269 --> 26:47.147
DO I CARE BECAUSE
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MY BROTHER?

26:47.147 --> 26:51.192
NO. I CARE BECAUSE
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER NOW,

26:51.192 --> 26:55.030
AND I WANT TO SEE IT WORK OUT
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.032
WHAT IS TO WORK OUT?

26:57.032 --> 26:59.701
I AM A DEAD MAN
NO MATTER WHAT.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.168
THIS GUY
WHO'S HOLDING ANDY HOSTAGE --

27:08.168 --> 27:10.545
BROOKLYN DETECTIVES
WENT THROUGH HIS APARTMENT

27:10.545 --> 27:12.213
AND FOUND
A STOCKPILE OF GUNS

27:12.213 --> 27:14.132
AND STACKS OF JOURNALS
SPOUTING ALL SORTS OF NONSENSE.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.217
PLUS, WORD'S COMING BACK NOW

27:16.217 --> 27:19.304
THAT HE DID TIME
IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.764
IT'LL WORK OUT.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.474
YEAH, WE SHOULD BE
BACK THERE FOR ANDY.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.516
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
BACK AT THE SQUAD

27:23.516 --> 27:25.060
EXCEPT GET WORKED UP.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.519
WHAT WAS MEDAVOY THINKING
WHEN HE GRABBED THIS GUY UP,

27:26.519 --> 27:27.646
OR WAS HE?

27:27.646 --> 27:28.647
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT GREG NEEDS
RIGHT NOW?

27:28.647 --> 27:29.898
SUPPORT FROM THE REST OF US.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.816
HE MADE A MISTAKE,

27:31.816 --> 27:34.319
BUT DON'T THINK
THIS ISN'T TEARING HIM UP.

27:34.319 --> 27:37.739
AW, COME ON.
IT'S ON NY1 NOW.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.366
WHAT, DID THEY
GIVE ANDY'S NAME?

27:39.366 --> 27:41.284
NO, JUST THAT THERE'S
A HOSTAGE SITUATION

27:41.284 --> 27:42.410
INVOLVING A DETECTIVE.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.079
SHOULD WE DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THEO?

27:44.079 --> 27:45.330
I DON'T KNOW.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.418
HERE'S OUR GUY.

28:20.782 --> 28:21.783
MY ARM!

28:21.783 --> 28:23.284
SHUT UP!

28:31.918 --> 28:33.128
WE'LL DO A DOUBLE TAP.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.714
FIRST SHOOTER
TAKES OUT THE WINDOW,

28:35.714 --> 28:37.716
SECOND HITS THE TARGET.
WE'RE AN INCH FROM THE GLASS.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.883
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T
SHATTER?

28:38.883 --> 28:40.552
WE'LL HIT THE TARGET.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.011
WHAT IF THIS GUY FLINCHES
AND PULLS THE TRIGGER?

28:42.011 --> 28:44.514
THIS GUY WON'T TALK
TO OUR NEGOTIATOR.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.099
HE'S OBVIOUSLY DERANGED.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.809
HE'S NOT EVEN TALKING
TO YOUR GUY ANYMORE.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.352
I DON'T LIKE IT.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.437
I HAVE CLEARANCE
TO GO TACTICAL.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.356
IF I HAVE THE SHOT,
I'M TAKING IT.

28:53.356 --> 28:54.774
I'VE LET YOU STAY IN HERE
AS A COURTESY,

28:54.774 --> 28:57.068
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK
ABOUT LEAVING NOW.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.946
CLEAR THE HALLWAY
IN CASE OF RICOCHET.

28:59.946 --> 29:02.365
I DON'T LIKE IT.

29:02.365 --> 29:03.616
WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT.

29:06.202 --> 29:08.496
Andy: COME ON, DAVE,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:10.749 --> 29:13.460
WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO, DAVE?

29:13.460 --> 29:16.504
PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER

29:16.504 --> 29:19.924
WAS READY
TO DECRIMINALIZE POT.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.177
NOT LEGALIZE, WHICH IS
WHAT EVERYBODY TRIPS ON.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.303
DECRIMINALIZE.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.847
AND THEN HIS DRUG CZAR
CONVINCES HIM

29:25.847 --> 29:28.725
THAT IT'S A HARD DRUG --
A GATEWAY DRUG.
