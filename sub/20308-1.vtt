00:14.639 --> 00:18.435
(plane engine droning overhead)

00:29.571 --> 00:31.865
(plane engine sputtering)

00:31.948 --> 00:33.033
MAN: It won't come back.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.702
We're right over the city.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.122
-(engine cuts out)
-MAN: God!

00:40.665 --> 00:42.417
-We're gonna go down!
-(warning beeping)

00:42.500 --> 00:44.836
-Call 'em on the tower!
-MAN 2: No, there'll be cops.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.922
-MAN: Oh.
-(beeping continues)

00:50.842 --> 00:55.346
-MAN: Sorry I had to do this!
-MAN 2: Oh, please! We're doing this?

00:55.430 --> 00:58.933
(explosion)

01:02.771 --> 01:05.398
(footsteps running)

01:07.192 --> 01:09.152
BOY: Look what happened. Look at that!

01:09.235 --> 01:10.862
BOY 2: They're all gonna be dead,
whoever's in there.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.698
-GIRL: I ain't lookin'.
-BOY 2: So then go away, Deirdre.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.784
-They're dead, man.
-MAN: You kids get away.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.535
-BOY: It's a plane wreck.
-BOY 2: What you yell at us for?

01:17.619 --> 01:18.912
MAN: I'm telling ya, get out!

01:19.079 --> 01:21.122
BOY 2: I know you, man,
you hang at Jerry's Sub Shop.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.040
BOY 1: Jerry's numbers.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.541
MAN: Want me to beat you?
You wanna get beat up?

01:23.625 --> 01:25.710
BOY 1: You wanna rob 'em,
rob their bodies.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.129
-MAN: Go on!
-BOY 2: Ow! You a jerk, man.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.882
-BOY 1: You stink, man, you a thief!
-MAN: Go on!

01:31.758 --> 01:34.469
Tell anyone you saw me,
and I'll come back and whip you good!

01:41.559 --> 01:43.645
Holy God!

01:52.612 --> 01:55.365
SID: Bobby, please, I got business here.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.742
-It's important, Sid.
-It's important, huh?

01:58.451 --> 02:00.912
What, Bobby, you got a shot at boosting
your laundry out of the cleaners?

02:00.995 --> 02:05.416
-It's important, Sid, it's heavy.
-(scoffs) Okay.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.335
Come on.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.381
-Sorry, guys, street life.
-Go ahead.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.757
I'll take Norm's app.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.094
Norm, ask nice, honey gets money.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.056
-Okay, Bobby, what...
-Sid says you're in plumbing supply.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.516
You had partner problems.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.811
(clears throat)
Yeah, he put 25 G's up each nostril.

02:24.894 --> 02:28.022
Stuff's a curse. Can't tell you how many
lives I've seen it ruin.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.733
Trying to get business
back on its feet again.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.026
Banks don't want to hear about it.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.112
That's our niche, Norm, that's what we do.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.322
Uh, Donny, I think
you better get out of here.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.074
-What's the matter?
-SID: I think he may be hot.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.368
-Are you kidding?
-Uh-uh.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.745
I'll start you for ten.
We get two points a week.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.206
-Extra two every month you're outstanding.
-Right, okay.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.833
He knows how to get a hold of me.

02:47.667 --> 02:51.171
You! I get popped 'cause of you,
I'm gonna feed you your freakin' eyes!

02:54.883 --> 02:57.385
-Come on, go, Bobby.
-Can you make it happen for me, Sid?

02:57.468 --> 03:00.138
Wait where we said.
I'm gonna see what I can do.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.181
Excuse me.

03:02.223 --> 03:03.308
Here, here.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.144
Since when did you get to be captain
on this tour cruise, huh?

03:06.227 --> 03:07.312
Norm...

03:08.813 --> 03:09.856
Go, Bobby.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.530
(door rattling)

03:18.573 --> 03:20.158
Crazy, am I right, Norm?

03:20.241 --> 03:21.910
I just blow our connect with a shy

03:21.993 --> 03:24.078
that I've been trying
to set you up with, what?

03:24.412 --> 03:25.496
Three weeks now?

03:26.164 --> 03:29.042
And now, Norm, I'm laying hands on you.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.377
So this is how you gotta know

03:31.461 --> 03:34.339
what has come into our lives,
Norm, is so big.

03:34.631 --> 03:38.384
It is so powerful, Norm.
Or else I don't take the shot.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.429
-Tell me about the suitcase.
-Did you see that suitcase?

03:41.512 --> 03:42.805
Yes.

03:43.389 --> 03:46.643
Did you see the way that kid was bent over
with the weight of that thing?

03:46.935 --> 03:48.561
Do you know what was in it?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.272
Soda, Norm.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.484
(sniffing) Uncut.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.403
Direct from an air disaster.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.114
And not a pound, Norm.

04:00.198 --> 04:04.077
Which a pound, uncut,
streets for 20, 22.5.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.663
But it's not a pound, Norm.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.165
And it's not ten pounds, Norm.

04:09.249 --> 04:13.628
Which ten pounds, conservative,
moves at a deuce in six figures

04:13.711 --> 04:15.755
and gets two people, Norm...

04:16.589 --> 04:21.928
outta this stinkin' rat hole
and set up by any water we could think of.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.472
And not domestic water, Norm.
Did I say domestic water?

04:24.555 --> 04:27.642
Because it doesn't have
to be domestic water, Norm.

04:27.725 --> 04:31.854
We could set up by any water
in the whole stinkin' world!

04:31.938 --> 04:35.024
And it's not ten pounds, Norm,
that's not the amount.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.819
And it's not 20 pounds, Norm.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.196
Which, 20 pounds, Norm,

04:40.530 --> 04:43.825
gets broads and limousines

04:43.908 --> 04:46.452
and a house anywhere you could think of.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.288
And not 40 pounds.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.999
Not even 60 pounds, Norm,

04:51.082 --> 04:54.419
which is three quarters
of a million dollars.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.337
Norm...

04:57.422 --> 05:01.384
Eighty pounds, 80 pounds, Norm!

05:01.467 --> 05:04.137
That kid's intestines
were down in his testicles

05:04.220 --> 05:06.014
with the weight of that suitcase.

05:06.597 --> 05:10.435
Norm, I am going to ask you
a question once,

05:11.060 --> 05:14.522
and I don't think you would respect
me as a man if I didn't.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.275
That Bobby, he's a mouse.

05:17.608 --> 05:23.364
He is looking to off this stuff for
high four figures, 7,500, ten grand, max.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.116
Ten grand.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.077
And knowing the kind of person you are,
I wouldn't be surprised if you don't have

05:28.161 --> 05:30.246
that in a bank account somewhere,
am I right?

05:30.705 --> 05:33.166
And that Bobby is out of the picture.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.170
And you and me, Norm,

05:37.253 --> 05:42.050
are struggling like this
with that suitcase between us.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.428
I know that you are in law enforcement,

05:46.054 --> 05:48.765
but I'm asking you as a human being

05:49.265 --> 05:51.934
to consider the possibility

05:53.019 --> 05:57.315
of an entire fresh concept
and start in life.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.525
Hmm?

05:59.609 --> 06:02.153
Okay, Norm, I'm gonna take
my hand away from your lips now.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.991
It would mean, Norm, so much to me,

06:07.575 --> 06:10.328
if you gave me some positive indication

06:10.411 --> 06:12.705
that you would consider
what I am suggesting.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.793
Is there a glimmer, Norm?

06:18.669 --> 06:20.088
Is there any possibility?

06:23.174 --> 06:24.300
None.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.639
-None, you mean, in the sense of what?
-None.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.226
-Meaning?
-Meaning none.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.853
-None?
-None!

06:37.688 --> 06:39.399
(exhales)

06:39.482 --> 06:42.276
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:42.360 --> 06:44.070
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:44.153 --> 06:47.865
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:47.949 --> 06:49.659
(sirens wailing)

06:54.997 --> 06:58.418
(theme music playing)

07:57.143 --> 07:59.270
(indistinct chatter)

07:59.353 --> 08:01.689
-Who saw the plane come down?
-KIDS: I did, I did...

08:01.772 --> 08:04.525
I wanna know who actually
saw the plane hit

08:04.609 --> 08:07.111
-and explode into flames.
-I did, mister.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.238
-You lie, Evander.
-I saw it.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.657
-You was at breakfast.
-(laughs)

08:12.867 --> 08:14.368
Too much traffic around the coast

08:14.452 --> 08:16.621
and the plane wreck,
I had to fight my way through.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.581
Right, right.
Can we see some ID, please?

08:18.664 --> 08:21.501
Look, I've got to go through that wreckage
as quickly as possible.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.754
I've gotta retrieve the black box
and the occupants' personal effects.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.631
Yeah, well, how come they sent two of you?

08:27.006 --> 08:27.840
Sorry?

08:27.924 --> 08:31.177
That guy right there,
he's from the FAA too.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.137
And he happens to have ID, sir.

08:33.554 --> 08:37.058
Uh-huh, well, he's probably
from a different field office.

08:37.141 --> 08:38.518
Right, right.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.770
You wouldn't happen
to be a looter, would you?

08:40.853 --> 08:42.230
Oh, no, no, no. I gotta go.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.607
WOMAN: Okay, you got
the airplane in the background?

08:45.274 --> 08:46.275
Let's do it.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.571
I'm talking with FAA Inspector
James Foreman.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.950
Any preliminary theories, Mr. Foreman,
about the cause of this crash?

08:54.033 --> 08:56.160
We're just beginning to assemble the data.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.746
I'm told, as of yet, no manifest, flight,

08:58.829 --> 09:01.040
or destination plan
have been found filed for this plane

09:01.123 --> 09:02.625
at any of the local airports.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.502
We're just beginning to look into that.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.088
Is it possible this flight's
purpose was criminal?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.757
No contraband's been found on site.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.634
You've got to excuse me now.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.762
In a densely populated area,
there were no fatalities

09:14.845 --> 09:16.556
other than the flight's occupants.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.432
Wouldn't you call that a miracle?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.810
Everything is very preliminary.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.063
Mr. Foreman, one more question, please.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.899
As the investigation continues,

09:26.983 --> 09:28.734
we will be giving updates
throughout the day...

09:28.818 --> 09:31.279
(boys shouting)

09:31.362 --> 09:34.615
Hey, how come you ain't trying
to get on TV, Deirdre?

09:34.699 --> 09:35.866
Yeah?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.495
(chattering)

09:54.635 --> 09:56.512
Intake on Renaldo Limon, Sergeant.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.472
Trade you for a Phillip Allen.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.474
Thought you'd get ahead of me, didn't you?

10:02.018 --> 10:04.395
-Morning, Stanislaus.
-Morning, Lieutenant.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.938
Hey, how about that air wreck?

10:06.022 --> 10:08.399
-Oh, extraordinary.
-Oh, 50 feet either way,

10:08.482 --> 10:09.900
-who knows how many would've died.
-Mm.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.028
It's the luckiest thing I ever heard of.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.280
Well, not that the gentlemen
in the cockpit

10:14.363 --> 10:16.407
would necessarily share your opinion.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.578
No problem, Jimmy. I can imagine
how many calls you're juggling.

10:21.662 --> 10:24.498
You appellate clerks make
the whole judicial process run.

10:25.791 --> 10:29.045
(chuckling) You're right,
it's ranking up in flattery.

10:29.712 --> 10:33.382
Jimmy, uh, if you could
just persuade Judge Kramer

10:33.466 --> 10:35.343
to grant me one more extension.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.180
I've been swamped and I just want
the brief to make sense.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.892
My solemn oath, never again.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.519
You're a love.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.564
-Nate, how are you?
-Hi, Joyce.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.651
-Sergeant, which room?
-Interrogation two.

10:52.693 --> 10:55.237
I'm okay. Just about okay.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.906
You miss being a prosecutor?

10:56.989 --> 10:59.909
At least I always had the work, huh?
(laughs)

10:59.992 --> 11:01.744
Uh, truth is, Joyce...

11:02.244 --> 11:03.996
it's not happening for me
in private practice.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.206
What do you say, Nate?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.750
Did you hear about those
busts in the red zone?

11:08.125 --> 11:11.379
-They use a net?
-That sweep was totally 100 percent shaky.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.089
We should've taken five minutes,

11:13.172 --> 11:15.591
get 'em enjoined on probable cause
before it happened.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.843
-Meaning, I should have.
-Someone should have.

11:17.927 --> 11:18.886
Me go to Judge Kramer

11:18.969 --> 11:21.847
when I am ten days late
filing an appeal on Desantos?

11:21.931 --> 11:24.016
Now we'll have to take them case-by-case.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.601
Give me the ones
you have to give me, Danny.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.854
-Is that what you wanna hear?
-I'll leave them at the front desk.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.231
-See ya, Nate.
-Okay.

11:31.148 --> 11:33.609
(clears throat) Joyce,
there's something I'm asking you here.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.736
I'm trying to become an affiliate PD.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.864
Now, naturally, I'm not too popular
having been on the other side.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.575
But in the meantime...

11:41.659 --> 11:42.743
In the meantime, if I have a client

11:42.827 --> 11:45.913
I can pass onto you,
I'll be happy to, okay, Nate?

11:47.581 --> 11:49.750
-Ice Maiden, huh?
-Excuse me?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.712
Uh, that's what the ADA's
used to call you.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.088
Not me, them!

11:54.755 --> 11:56.882
Not now... ever.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.721
MAN: I just want it on record,
this guy might've done it himself.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.055
I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.891
I don't know what happened,
what this guy might've been up to.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.017
The invisible man?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.603
Guy comes into my store,
terrible headache.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.439
He's gotta take the aspirins right there.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.274
I give him some water, he takes 'em,

12:13.357 --> 12:15.484
-doubles over like that.
-Who doubles over?

12:15.568 --> 12:18.320
You the one's gonna take this down?
I'm gonna need a police report.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.489
What you gotta do
is notify the distributor,

12:20.573 --> 12:21.782
Lomax Pharmaceuticals.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.326
-These gotta be tested.
-What guy doubled over?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.203
With the headache! He's in my car.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.330
You saying these might be poison?

12:28.414 --> 12:29.498
You left the guy in your car?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.459
Hey, look,
you got liability questions here.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.961
I mean, if this stuff is poison,
I want it on record

12:34.044 --> 12:36.213
that you got notified
soon as possible time.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.882
-Where you parked?
-Up the corner.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.550
You can't get spaces around here.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.343
County Medical, Stan,
get a work-up on those pills.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.344
All right.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.556
Plane crash! I couldn't believe it.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.641
I thought it was gonna hit me.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.810
And people wonder why I drink.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.729
Lodging chits!

12:52.354 --> 12:53.189
Thank you, ma'am.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.692
-Chits for lodging!
-(chatter)

12:57.860 --> 12:58.986
Excuse me...

12:59.779 --> 13:02.531
-What does this mean?
-Lets you stay overnight.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.909
Crane, Drake, or Fenwick Hotel.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.452
Lodging chits!

13:06.911 --> 13:08.370
It's from the welfare.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.915
It's worth money for dinner.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.959
It's good for cocktails before dinner.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.920
And after dinner too.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.339
(stammers)
Oh, I thought it was for a room.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.467
Weatherman says clear skies.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.972
Uh, if you have enough cocktails,
I find dinner takes care of itself.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.267
Hey, hey, buck for a chit! Who wants it?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.269
How 'bout you, pal?

13:32.645 --> 13:35.022
Put a dollar in your pocket right now.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.067
You're just taking advantage
of him because he's green.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.444
Don't sell cheap.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.739
Man from the hotel gives us four.
He's waiting in my place.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.450
What do you mean,
the hotel guy buys these chits?

13:46.534 --> 13:49.662
-Four big ones.
-(siren wailing)

13:53.833 --> 13:55.417
MICK: What do you figure the hotel guy

13:55.501 --> 13:58.254
-does with these chits?
-(horn honking)

13:58.337 --> 14:00.631
-I mean, if welfare--
-I don't know, mister.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.844
Does he ever rent the rooms
out again to other people?

14:05.135 --> 14:06.720
Did you ever see him do that?

14:06.804 --> 14:10.724
He gives us four bucks,
and we take the money and buy cocktails.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.685
Marsha, is this zucchini any count?

14:12.768 --> 14:15.354
Almost... almost ready.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.817
-Ask him.
-Ask me what?

14:19.900 --> 14:22.611
Oh, I was asking about the chits.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.405
-Four bucks.
-Sold!

14:24.905 --> 14:25.739
-Right.
-(laughing)

14:25.823 --> 14:27.366
-You grow this?
-Yup.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.410
Come on, buddy, I ain't got all day.

14:29.493 --> 14:33.163
No. I'm gonna keep the chit,
I wanna sleep at the hotel.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.957
You wanna sleep at our hotel?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.418
This is good for sleeping there, isn't it?

14:37.501 --> 14:41.380
(chuckles) Yeah, I'll make sure that they
leave a chocolate mint on your pillow.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.595
You should stay outside.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.180
It's cocktail hour.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.061
(distant jackhammering)

14:58.731 --> 15:01.317
I'm allowing myself the flicker of a hope.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.402
Well, you allow yourself
whatever you want, Sid.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.321
I'm allowing myself hope, Norman,

15:05.404 --> 15:08.490
because you haven't been
in contact with your home base.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.743
That's 'cause maybe I wanna get
this thing taken care of

15:10.826 --> 15:13.037
without getting drowned in alphabet soup.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.789
The narcotics, firearms, DEA, FBI.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.500
YMCA. I know, Norm, I know.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.045
-Go on, say hello.
-Roberto!

15:24.632 --> 15:26.592
There is my guy.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.097
Hey, wait a minute,
something is different here.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.934
Something is, uh, is changed from before.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.727
-Right?
-What's going on?

15:36.810 --> 15:38.479
You know, you were so uptight before.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.398
I don't know whether you noticed
Norm sitting in the bar.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.483
I noticed him.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.783
Anyways, it's a hell of a coincidence

15:50.866 --> 15:52.743
because Norm is positioned

15:52.826 --> 15:56.205
to distribute
that product that you mentioned.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.500
-Think I'm a pushover, don't you, Sid?
-Excuse me?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.961
Think I'm just gonna roll over
and give that thing up.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.463
-(chuckling)
-Oh, hey, Bobby!

16:04.546 --> 16:07.466
You interrupt a move
I've been trying to set for three weeks.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.551
I put myself out to help you.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.679
Now you're gonna sit there
and go paranoid on me?

16:11.762 --> 16:14.390
Hey, not that
this isn't a great thrill for me

16:14.473 --> 16:15.933
watching you suck your blanket,

16:16.016 --> 16:18.060
but, uh, I understood
you got stuff to sell.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.145
I got stuff, man.
Did you see that suitcase?

16:20.229 --> 16:21.855
Yeah, I saw it, and I wanna know

16:21.939 --> 16:23.983
if it's on the premises
and what's inside it?

16:24.066 --> 16:27.903
Bobby, I saw the soda.
Norm's lookin' for confirmation.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.656
There's gonna be an auction. (chuckles)

16:32.074 --> 16:34.201
-Come again?
-An auction?

16:34.284 --> 16:36.912
I put the word out.
Stuff's going best offer.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.373
Cash on the table. (laughs)

16:41.834 --> 16:43.502
Oh, Bobby.

16:43.585 --> 16:46.005
I put the word, couple of serious people.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.465
Gonna let the free marketplace
set the price.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.051
-You dumb cluck.
-What's a matter, Sid?

16:51.135 --> 16:55.139
Afraid you're gonna see somebody you owe?
(laughing)

16:57.099 --> 17:00.185
When does this, uh, auction take place?

17:03.397 --> 17:04.356
What time is it?

17:05.315 --> 17:06.567
Eleven.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.695
It's all about to happen. (chuckles)

17:14.283 --> 17:16.035
How'd this guy live this long?

17:20.831 --> 17:23.709
(traffic sounds)

17:24.126 --> 17:26.712
She's under too much pressure.
She's taking too much onto herself.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.047
All right, ma'am.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.923
-This isn't like her.
-Okay.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.928
I'm sorry, Brenda.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.433
They won't listen. They don't mind.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.893
What's going on, ma'am?

17:42.269 --> 17:45.939
So you explain to me,
you tell me how to do!

17:46.023 --> 17:47.858
RENKO: Calm down, ma'am.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.031
Ma'am?

17:54.782 --> 17:55.908
Oh, Papi.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.787
Oh, I'm sorry. Papi...

17:59.870 --> 18:01.038
RENKO: This old man looks
like he's in pretty bad shape.

18:01.121 --> 18:04.833
Hello, Puddin'. When did you come here?

18:05.459 --> 18:09.129
-Papi, I'm sorry I hit you.
-RENKO: Take a look at that eye.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.049
-Oh, Papi.
-BOBBY: How long has this been going on?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.176
WOMAN: Oh, God. She never beat him before.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.136
This is pitiful.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.388
She's the only one. It's her grandparents.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.516
Her mama died and she's the only one
to take care of 'em.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.184
Call the paramedics, Andy.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.814
Could you, uh,
stay here a while, Mrs. Harrison?

18:26.897 --> 18:28.398
My own's coming at noon.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.568
All right.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.987
-(Renko indistinct)
-Could you get up, please?

18:34.071 --> 18:38.033
Officer, Brenda's a good girl.
She's only trying to help us.

18:39.660 --> 18:44.581
He put the pork chops down the sink,
and the pipes got all backed up.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.835
-I had a whole dinner laid out.
-All right.

18:48.502 --> 18:53.465
I'm a phone operator.
I bring home $223 a week.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.552
I'm paying the plumber,
I can't get their medicine.

18:59.638 --> 19:03.892
Papi, Mrs. Harrison's
gonna stay with you a while.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.645
Hello, Puddin'.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.482
-You makin' a phone call?
-Bobby, paramedics are on the way.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.443
-I'm gonna need my scarf.
-Okay.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.365
And my felt hat.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.084
-Arthur.
-I know.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.839
Remember last time,
what I said about another arrest?

19:33.922 --> 19:35.674
I know, I remember.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.468
It's a third offense, Arthur.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.846
That means it's going to be a lot of time.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.347
I can handle the junk.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.349
Half the people inside is high.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.935
But I like my freedom.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.062
I like to be able to smell the air...

19:49.813 --> 19:51.440
And yet, you pull a 2-11

19:51.523 --> 19:53.901
two stores from a corner
with a traffic cop.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.029
Have them put me next to somebody.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.532
In the slams, put me next to somebody big.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.451
Somebody that they want real bad.

20:03.076 --> 20:06.622
I mean, I could hear what they got to say
and maybe I can give 'em up.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.166
I know what you mean.

20:09.249 --> 20:12.211
I ain't got nothing else but my Jones,
Miss Davenport.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.423
I don't run with nobody.
I don't cut nobody. I rob.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.133
I am a small-timer.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.344
I ain't got anything else to deal.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.970
What you're asking...

20:22.429 --> 20:25.390
I know a lot of lawyers
that sets stuff like this up.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.017
I'm not one of them.

20:27.935 --> 20:28.769
You know one?

20:32.356 --> 20:33.273
I'll think.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.317
I'll see.

20:36.151 --> 20:40.739
"When will they learn? What will it take?
Must someone die? More to follow."

20:41.240 --> 20:42.741
Where'd they find that, which section?

20:43.200 --> 20:45.494
Two aisles down
from the tainted bottle of aspirin.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.829
Sounds like the Martinville note.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.748
-Do we know something about that?
-MAN: Unsolved case, Captain.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.584
Over-the-counter anti-flatulence
laced with rat poison.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.632
Uh, the victim, Mr. Lahey,
won't be of help.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.759
Doctors seem to think
he's not going to regain consciousness.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.553
FRANK: Preliminary analysis
found no prints on the note.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.515
We have graphology
and paper-contents study underway.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.685
Our detectives are continuing
investigation of the pharmacy

21:09.768 --> 21:12.479
to see if, uh,
other merchandise is involved.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.189
How long am I going to be closed, Captain?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.566
Well, they have chamber of commerce
volunteers over there.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.110
I don't think it's
gonna be too much longer.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.362
For what it's worth,
my salary is a percentage of gross.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.490
Lieutenant Goldblume here
will supervise the case,

21:23.782 --> 21:26.702
coordinating Dr. Hurley
and FBI agent Coleman.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.246
Bureau's look-see only
at this point, gentlemen,

21:29.329 --> 21:31.331
until we find that the poison
crossed state lines.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.834
FRANK: Doctor, until we get
some more definitive evidence,

21:33.917 --> 21:36.628
we're gonna leave the decision
on recall up to your company.

21:36.712 --> 21:37.838
We'd like to hold off on that.

21:37.921 --> 21:41.466
Locally, we're bringing in anybody
who's made a complaint against the store.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.135
If you could broaden, in that regard.

21:43.218 --> 21:46.096
Uh, reads out people
in your neck of the woods

21:46.179 --> 21:47.889
with complaints on our products.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.100
We'll make a desk available to you.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.978
-This all our city?
-A lot of angry people in the world.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.147
Well, suppositories are clean.

21:55.230 --> 21:58.567
You know, I feel like a scum wad.
I feel like ten cents.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.319
Hmm. Chick never told you
she was gettin' married?

22:00.402 --> 22:03.905
What knocks me out is she's got the stones
to invite me to the ceremony.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.615
-Poor Sanzone.
-(chuckles)

22:05.699 --> 22:07.826
Sanzone and me were in the same class
at the academy.

22:07.909 --> 22:11.204
-Nice guy?
-Not much in the brain housing department.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.791
Hey, check for prints
on that suntan lotion too, okay, Maury?

22:15.292 --> 22:17.336
Man, dudes get creative
once they get started.

22:17.544 --> 22:21.423
You know, maybe I ought to tell Sanzone
what he's lettin' himself in for.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.758
Yeah, good idea, J.D.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.634
Just go up to the groom
at the wedding ceremony

22:24.718 --> 22:26.595
and say, "I've been plunkin' your bride."

22:26.678 --> 22:28.680
Believe me, Neal,
I'd be doing the guy a favor.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.349
Well, maybe she'll turn over a new leaf.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.267
Carlotta? No shot.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.228
(indistinct chatter in background)

22:41.818 --> 22:44.404
-Grocery list.
-Mm-hm, Carlotta's telephone number.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.114
All finished in the other sections,
Detective.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.282
Twelve's the last one.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.160
On to feminine hygiene?

22:50.827 --> 22:54.081
(train bell ringing)

22:54.915 --> 22:57.250
BOBBY: That's it, got a full deck now.

22:57.417 --> 23:00.045
Sorry, <i>esse,</i> but Maria's
gotta see if you're packin'.

23:00.128 --> 23:03.924
Yeah, understood, no problem.
Makes me feel more comfortable.

23:04.007 --> 23:08.136
-Especially who's doin' the friskin'.
-You got that right.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.388
He's okay.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.015
Join the party.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.894
-What you think of that stuff, Luis?
-It's all right, man.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.562
-It's all right, huh?
-All right, man.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.731
Arturo, see if it's all right.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.567
I'm on it, Bob, I'm on it.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.653
Jerry. (laughs)

23:26.363 --> 23:27.614
Check it out, Norm.

23:29.866 --> 23:32.869
-What for?
-Say what? What for, huh?

23:32.953 --> 23:36.123
Hey, Bobby, stop repeating
what everybody's saying.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.666
Sid's man don't wanna try it.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.501
Thinks I'm running in a hummer sample.

23:39.584 --> 23:42.254
I wanna know if I'm buying
what I'm sampling here.

23:42.337 --> 23:44.589
-I wanna see the suitcase.
-Hey, Maria.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.050
Ever see me holding enough to run a game?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.970
I never seen you holding, period.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.013
Even so, Bob, he's got a point.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.307
Believe me, Turo, it's around.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.644
Heavy as that suitcase is,
it ain't gonna be far away.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.896
All right, come on, come on.
Where is it, huh?

23:59.980 --> 24:01.898
I wanna hear numbers first.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.608
Turo, it's here!

24:03.692 --> 24:05.944
-That's it, now! Everybody down!
-Hold it! Hold it!

24:06.027 --> 24:08.029
-What did you do to me, Maria?
-Get down, get down, cool it!

24:08.113 --> 24:08.947
Arturo!

24:09.823 --> 24:11.825
-Oh, my God!
-Bobby!

24:12.492 --> 24:14.286
No, no, no, no, no!
Listen, listen, please!

24:14.369 --> 24:15.620
I got $40,000!

24:15.704 --> 24:17.247
He's got $40,000! He does!

24:17.330 --> 24:18.748
I swear! I swear!

24:18.832 --> 24:20.584
It's at my place! It's outside!

24:20.667 --> 24:22.919
-You got $40,000?
-I swear, honest to God!

24:23.003 --> 24:25.964
-You lying to me?
-I'll take you to it!

24:26.047 --> 24:28.133
-Come on, get up!
-Just don't shoot.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.509
-Don't-don't shoot. Take it easy.
-Get up!

24:29.593 --> 24:31.470
Take it easy. Take it easy.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.056
Just take it easy.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.772
(police radio chatter)

24:42.856 --> 24:44.816
(people chattering)

24:47.736 --> 24:51.281
Say, what are the chances
of keeping this site sanitized overnight?

24:51.364 --> 24:52.657
Sanitized?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.618
You'd have to have a cop assigned.

24:54.701 --> 24:57.037
-The ribbons wouldn't do it?
-Probably not.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.164
Pretty good chance it'd be vandalized.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.999
Ah, the heck with it. We'll be through.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.752
Did you figure it out, what happened?

25:04.377 --> 25:06.338
Engine malfunction caused the crash.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.173
As far as what they were doing,

25:08.256 --> 25:10.425
we've got no positives
off a comprehensive canvas

25:10.509 --> 25:11.635
of all the airports.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.512
There's no ID on either body.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.431
If I had to guess,
I'd say they were up to no good.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.808
They're in the right neighborhood.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.271
So you don't think this would do it, huh?

25:23.355 --> 25:26.149
(chuckling)

25:26.233 --> 25:29.069
(playful shouting)

25:33.156 --> 25:35.659
(indistinct chatter)

25:35.742 --> 25:40.121
MICK: Excuse me, I was told this voucher
would be good for one night's lodging.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.582
MAN: Take a walk. We don't do this here.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.379
-No, this is my chit.
-Look, you want four bucks?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.506
Wait 'til tomorrow. Lenny handles that.

25:49.589 --> 25:51.716
I don't want four bucks.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.635
-I want a room.
-A room, huh?

25:53.718 --> 25:57.389
I got a busted thermostat, bad cough.
I oughta be indoors.

25:57.472 --> 26:00.517
Okay, pal, great, he'll take care of ya.

26:01.434 --> 26:03.311
Friend. (chuckles)

26:04.437 --> 26:06.690
Say, were you, uh, held back in school?

26:06.773 --> 26:07.983
-What?
-I'm saying.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.693
'Cause you're such a slow learner.

26:10.068 --> 26:13.613
Cut the jokes. Uh, they told me
that chit gets me a room.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.282
Ah, yeah, sure.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.159
(coughing)

26:20.704 --> 26:22.205
-(screams)
-WOMAN: Ay!

26:22.622 --> 26:23.665
(grunts)

26:24.040 --> 26:25.792
You get the message yet?

26:26.126 --> 26:28.211
-Huh, slow learner?
-(baby crying)

26:28.878 --> 26:33.341
All that chit is good for
is some rot gut to keep you loaded!

26:33.675 --> 26:35.218
(baby crying)

26:35.302 --> 26:37.679
-You got a problem, amigo?
-No, no, no, sir, no, sir.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.097
Well, then shut the freakin' door!

26:39.180 --> 26:41.891
(stutters) I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.018
(baby crying)

26:43.101 --> 26:46.354
Now, I guess that they
didn't check out yet.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.357
Are you sure
you don't wanna sell your chit?

26:50.692 --> 26:52.110
When will my room be ready?

26:52.193 --> 26:53.945
(panting)

26:54.654 --> 26:58.033
You ain't gonna do it, pal.
I'm not gonna let you bring me down.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.576
You just have a nice day.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.247
(baby crying)

27:15.091 --> 27:17.677
Are you okay? Huh? Can you walk?

27:17.761 --> 27:18.970
-Yeah.
-Good.

27:19.512 --> 27:20.472
Okay.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.266
(baby crying)

27:23.350 --> 27:25.769
(indistinct chatter)

27:27.729 --> 27:28.772
You stay here.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.445
See Lieutenant Buntz, Stan?

27:35.528 --> 27:38.031
Uh, he's got a morning meeting
on his undercover, Lieutenant.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.575
He ain't checked in yet.
Message in case he calls?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.744
-Uh, only if he gets back.
-Uh-huh.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.664
We need all the help we can get
questioning people on this poison case.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.749
Uh, don't rain but it pours,
right, Lieutenant?

27:47.832 --> 27:48.833
Hmm.

27:50.293 --> 27:51.503
I can show you my case notes.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.963
I predicted this situation
a long time ago.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.882
Look, it's obvious
she's got to be charged,

27:55.965 --> 27:58.343
but it's also obvious she didn't
wanna do what she did.

27:58.426 --> 27:59.928
See, we figured judge would be lenient

28:00.011 --> 28:02.097
if he felt the situation
wasn't gonna be repeated.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.432
Unless that home situation changes,

28:04.516 --> 28:07.018
I have no reason to believe
it won't be repeated.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.562
Mrs. Washington is a rheumatoid arthritic.

28:09.646 --> 28:13.108
Mr. Washington is rapidly
approaching helpless senility!

28:13.191 --> 28:15.485
WOMAN: Now, as well-intended
as their granddaughter is,

28:15.568 --> 28:17.570
she has neither the money
nor the emotional wherewithal

28:17.654 --> 28:19.072
to take care of those people.

28:19.155 --> 28:21.825
Now, I made provisions
almost two months ago

28:21.908 --> 28:24.786
for Mr. Washington to be
institutionalized at Larchmore.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.789
And I know Mrs. Washington
can be taken to the Baptist home.

28:27.872 --> 28:28.790
And the granddaughter fought it?

28:28.873 --> 28:31.000
Well, evidently when the mother was dying

28:31.084 --> 28:33.920
she secured a deathbed promise
from Brenda to care for them.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.630
What are you telling them, Mrs. Lane?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.340
I'm no good? You're telling them--

28:37.424 --> 28:40.427
-Ma'am? Brenda? Brenda! Brenda!
-What I'm saying, Miss Washington--

28:40.510 --> 28:44.139
We need to work things out
so everybody's interests are protected.

28:44.222 --> 28:48.685
-You think I don't love my grandparents?
-No, no, no. We know you love them.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.231
I love them.
I am trying to take care of them.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.819
Brenda, Mrs. Lane says
you have your own apartment.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.113
Who's gonna take care of them?

29:00.196 --> 29:02.323
She said your grandfather
needs to go to the hospital

29:02.407 --> 29:04.451
and that your grandmother
could go to the Baptist home.

29:04.534 --> 29:07.912
Hospital didn't make a promise.
I promised. I did.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.540
You promised your mother
that you would take care of them

29:10.623 --> 29:11.958
the best you could, right?

29:12.375 --> 29:14.043
That's right. That's right.

29:14.127 --> 29:18.465
And now you're so worn out from trying
that you made a serious mistake.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.510
We know you love them,
but if you're so tired

29:22.594 --> 29:24.846
that you can't make good decisions,

29:25.764 --> 29:28.391
Brenda, someone else
is gonna have to decide

29:28.475 --> 29:29.476
what's best for them.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.354
Let me help.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.983
Let me help, please.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.699
Got any prescription exhilarant?

29:45.450 --> 29:47.410
Planning to take on the world, Counselor?

29:47.952 --> 29:52.248
-Just trying to live in it.
-(chuckling) Don't try any fast getaways.

29:52.957 --> 29:54.959
-Stolen?
-No, a uniform turned them in.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.295
And they were sticking out
of the door of your car.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.257
Uh, Frank, I, uh,
I just wanted tell you that

30:01.800 --> 30:03.843
I'm calling a surprise inspection

30:03.927 --> 30:06.429
of my emergency action team tomorrow a.m.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.430
Oh?

30:07.514 --> 30:09.599
Assuming, of course,
that you, uh, you approve.

30:09.682 --> 30:10.725
It's your call, Howard.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.895
Well, the fact is, Frank,
I, um, I feel that

30:13.978 --> 30:17.232
a surprise inspection
of the entire shift at turnout

30:17.315 --> 30:19.984
is an insufficiently
employed morale booster.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.237
Howard, roll call's supposed to
get the men out on the streets

30:22.320 --> 30:23.571
where the criminals are.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.823
Only speaking from
personal experience, Captain,

30:24.906 --> 30:27.283
I find that it keeps
an officer on his toes.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.829
Surprised myself this morning
with an inspection.

30:31.704 --> 30:32.622
How'd you do?

30:33.998 --> 30:36.876
Uh, on report, a frayed right cuff.

30:43.883 --> 30:46.386
-You're the one got me into this!
-You got yourself into this!

30:46.469 --> 30:48.721
Uh, you're next, Floyd.
Right this way, please.

30:48.972 --> 30:52.100
-It was about my pantyhose.
-You wrote a letter--

30:52.183 --> 30:55.603
I put 'em on and the seam unravels.
So I filed a complaint.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.355
You think that I would poison
the whole city

30:57.438 --> 30:59.315
because I have a run in my pantyhose?

30:59.399 --> 31:02.861
It's the guard dogs,
those crazy Dobermans.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.070
At the pharmacy?

31:04.153 --> 31:07.407
Yes, a man can't sleep, a man can't think.

31:07.490 --> 31:10.660
-You know, they ought to walk them more.
-There's a report that you threatened

31:10.743 --> 31:12.161
management over a year ago.

31:12.245 --> 31:15.415
Guy runs the store catches my son
taking some Band-Aids.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.292
He burned him with a cigarette.

31:17.375 --> 31:21.087
I told him if he touched my boy again,
I'd kill him! That still goes.

31:21.921 --> 31:23.256
What do you think, Doctor?

31:23.923 --> 31:25.967
Well, nothing fits the profile.

31:26.050 --> 31:29.012
Has your company decided
on the recall yet, Doctor?

31:29.095 --> 31:32.098
Uh, Lieutenant, that isn't a decision
you come to lightly.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.016
I know.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.810
A decision like that
has tremendous ripple effects.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.687
-Emotional, economic--
-I know.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.355
Just one aspect.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.649
Know what happens
to Lomax Pharmaceutical stock

31:41.733 --> 31:44.277
if it turns out this isn't,
uh, a local crank?

31:44.360 --> 31:46.112
If this recall goes national?

31:46.195 --> 31:48.323
Know the kind of dollars
we're talking about?

31:48.990 --> 31:50.241
What kind of a doctor are you?

31:50.950 --> 31:53.536
Management science.
Ellroy School of Business.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.001
-Three at a time, Irwin?
-Just through intake, Joyce.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.295
Three kids in a car.
They're stopped for speeding.

32:02.378 --> 32:04.589
There's a .22 under the seat,
plain as day.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.718
"Under the seat, plain as day."
Why do I think there's a contradiction?

32:08.801 --> 32:09.802
Stop it, man.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.055
Hey, homeboys,
you're givin' me a headache, eh?

32:12.138 --> 32:14.515
Hey, I'll save you all
a lot of trouble, man.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.726
-It was Ethan's gat.
-Mine, sucker?

32:16.809 --> 32:18.811
-Who bought it from Brown?
-And whose money was it?

32:18.895 --> 32:20.688
Hey, I didn't even know
the gat was in there.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.358
Believe that. It was your car, fool.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.567
OFFICER: Guys, just cool down.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.486
If they're going to roll over
on each other,

32:26.569 --> 32:28.196
they're going to need separate counsel.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.531
Even if it were legal
for me to take on all three,

32:30.615 --> 32:33.076
-it would prejudice their case.
-Please?

32:33.409 --> 32:35.453
I'll have two other PDs
assigned before questioning.

32:35.536 --> 32:36.454
Joyce?

32:37.413 --> 32:39.624
I just wanna thank you
for giving me Arthur Baker.

32:39.707 --> 32:42.794
-Arthur's a real prize.
-No, it really helps me.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.462
You should take ten percent.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.091
I don't want ten percent, Nate,
but there's something I do want.

32:48.716 --> 32:51.219
I don't want Arthur
used against any of my clients.

32:51.886 --> 32:52.804
Used?

32:53.262 --> 32:55.014
I think you understand me, Nate.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.726
Two have priors, misdemeanors.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.687
Ethan Dillon has a warrant outstanding.

33:01.270 --> 33:03.398
-Robbery-homicide.
-Mom and pop store.

33:03.773 --> 33:06.109
He blew away mom with a .22.

33:06.776 --> 33:10.196
-Will you be claiming the same weapon?
-You will be the first to know.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.159
Ethan.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.373
You know, the police have been
trying to find you since May?

33:20.456 --> 33:21.290
Who, me?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.251
They spelling my name right?

33:24.919 --> 33:27.422
Sergeant, I'll talk to them
in interrogation A.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.718
-TEEN: Oh, man, take it easy.
-Come on, let's go.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.762
-Officer?
-Yes?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.973
Uh, I'm here about my phone bill.

33:37.056 --> 33:39.308
Oh, we stopped takin'
those payments a long time ago.

33:39.392 --> 33:43.604
(stammers) But this one is for $37,640.

33:44.313 --> 33:47.025
Phone company said somebody
tied into my charge number

33:47.108 --> 33:48.192
and distributed it.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.653
Must've sent it out on one
of them Xerox chain letters.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.655
Look, sir, I'm sorry for your trouble,

33:52.739 --> 33:54.198
but we got a real circus
going on here today.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.492
Mrs. Alfredo at the Pearl Street office

33:56.576 --> 34:00.038
said that I should circle
every call that isn't mine, I mean...

34:00.121 --> 34:02.665
Well, what do you want us to do?
Arrest Mrs. Alfredo?

34:02.999 --> 34:05.960
-Arrest the Pearl Street office?
-No, I just wanna know.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.880
They can't make me pay this, can they?

34:10.465 --> 34:13.259
No, sir. No, they can't make you pay.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.094
I mean, that's a legal opinion
you're giving me?

34:15.178 --> 34:16.846
Oh, mister, please, I--

34:16.929 --> 34:19.348
Sir, I'm an attorney.
They can't make you pay.

34:19.432 --> 34:22.018
I mean, I pay my bills.
I don't want any trouble.

34:22.101 --> 34:25.021
I mean, if I had to pay,
you know, if they made me, well,

34:25.396 --> 34:28.566
I've been saving for the kids' education
and-and, there's the house.

34:28.649 --> 34:31.694
I-I could just about cover it if I had to.

34:32.945 --> 34:35.490
It's their mistake.
It's up to them to fix it.

34:35.573 --> 34:38.409
Course it would be
a terrific setback for us.

34:41.788 --> 34:42.872
Uh, but then that'd--

34:42.955 --> 34:46.375
that'd be your legal opinion
that I'm probably all right?

34:46.459 --> 34:48.336
-Yeah.
-Okay.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.589
-MAN: Want that number?
-Oh!

34:53.049 --> 34:55.885
Uh, excuse me. Can I show you something?

34:55.968 --> 34:57.845
Yeah, where do you want these phones?

34:57.929 --> 35:00.056
No, it's these bills here.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.058
MARIA: Hey...

35:02.642 --> 35:06.562
You keep me around and I'll do you
better than you can believe.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.689
Yeah, okay, baby.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.108
That hurts.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.319
-How far?
-Close.

35:13.402 --> 35:16.239
-We're gettin' close, right?
-Yeah.

35:16.989 --> 35:18.533
SID: It's only a little ways more.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.706
(thumping car door)

35:27.959 --> 35:30.837
Hey, Norm, it's our lives at stake.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.589
(stutters) You know, I been thinkin',
what's the good of havin'

35:33.673 --> 35:36.592
all that money in a box
if we're not alive to spend it?

35:36.676 --> 35:38.010
Look, what are you
talkin' about, Sid, huh?

35:38.094 --> 35:40.555
What are you talkin' about?
I'm taking him to the money, all right?

35:40.638 --> 35:42.140
-Okay.
-All right.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.474
SID: Okay.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.644
-(thumping car door)
-No, man, it's my life.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.855
You know, he's takin' you to $40,000.

35:48.938 --> 35:50.648
-Well, he's got more than that.
-Shut up, Sid!

35:50.731 --> 35:52.567
-Why don't you shut up, huh?
-He--

35:52.650 --> 35:54.694
There's $40,000
at the place we're goin' to,

35:54.777 --> 35:56.612
but he's got more at the other place.

35:56.696 --> 35:57.905
We should be goin' upstate.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.825
-Just take us to this!
-All right.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.040
-(sighs)
-Sarge, I got a wedding.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.792
Little notice wouldn't hurt, Detective.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.420
I'm givin' you as much notice
as the bride gave me.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.130
I was gonna make the pop
right then, Captain,

36:14.213 --> 36:16.090
then I see the room
is stuffed with illegals.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.426
They get ten bucks per head
per night, Captain Furillo.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.303
And that's on top of the welfare scam.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.762
-Immigration ready to move?
-Yeah.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.515
-We would like to be in on your bust, sir.
-Our warrants are ready, Captain.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.601
-Okay, do it.
-Thank you, Captain.

36:29.604 --> 36:33.691
MAN: So this guy says the Bureau
put a radio control in his head,

36:33.774 --> 36:35.276
and we activate it at night.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.695
Well, there's no rational
pattern to fix on.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.489
The only way to catch these guys
is out of left field.

36:40.573 --> 36:41.407
Gentlemen...

36:41.490 --> 36:43.367
HENRY: Mr. Lahey has
regained consciousness.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.870
Our detectives are finished
at the drug store.

36:45.953 --> 36:47.538
Nothing else there had been touched.

36:47.622 --> 36:50.166
Our company's extensively
checked the distribution log

36:50.249 --> 36:52.710
those pain relievers came from, Captain.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.837
-It's clean.
-Graphology's come up empty.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.006
Paper it was written on is common as dirt.

36:57.089 --> 36:59.467
I better call the motel
and get them to extend.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.220
I just been through one of these,
you know, down south.

37:02.887 --> 37:06.182
Had to get a release from a man
who'd taken cough syrup full of lye.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.309
Wasn't anything left of his lungs.

37:08.392 --> 37:09.894
Hearing him breathe, quite honestly,

37:09.977 --> 37:12.146
I thought the man
would've been better off dead.

37:13.814 --> 37:16.150
I did it! You want poison?

37:16.234 --> 37:19.612
You look in the food that manager
gives his crazy dogs, huh!

37:19.695 --> 37:22.073
Every night I hear them! (chuckles)

37:22.156 --> 37:26.160
-Now I get a little peace and quiet.
-Excuse me, sir, that's my cup.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.622
You put me where they got no Doberman!

37:30.289 --> 37:31.832
Now playing left field...

37:33.084 --> 37:34.919
(organ playing softly)

37:35.002 --> 37:36.462
(yawning)

37:38.297 --> 37:42.510
And with all my earthly goods,
I thee endow.

37:43.302 --> 37:44.929
And with all my earthly goods...

37:47.306 --> 37:48.432
I thee endow.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.977
You think Tommy
had to write this out on his cuff?

37:51.060 --> 37:53.145
OFFICIANT: By the authority vested in me

37:53.229 --> 37:56.899
in the eyes of God and man,
Thomas and Carlotta,

37:57.233 --> 38:00.319
I now pronounce you man and wife.

38:02.029 --> 38:03.030
You may kiss the bride.

38:04.865 --> 38:06.534
I'm not gonna kiss the bride, okay?

38:09.161 --> 38:11.497
-All right?
-CARLOTTA: What is it, Tommy?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.125
You've been steppin' out, okay?

38:14.208 --> 38:15.209
Let me out.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.044
-J.D.: Hey, sit down.
-I know what you been doin',

38:17.128 --> 38:18.629
and I know who you been doin' it with too!

38:20.256 --> 38:22.049
-Tommy! Stop!
-Hey, look!

38:22.133 --> 38:24.552
Jeez, Petey Severino's
been boppin' her too!

38:24.635 --> 38:27.805
-(clamoring)
-We better help, man.

38:27.888 --> 38:30.766
Sanzone's got some grip on him, you know.
Man's got hands like a vice!

38:30.850 --> 38:33.644
-J.D.: Hey!
-(gagging)

38:34.812 --> 38:37.273
-(door slams)
-(indistinct chatter)

38:37.356 --> 38:38.774
-(banging on door)
-Hey!

38:41.986 --> 38:45.072
-(choking)
-I should go to him, I should talk to him.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.700
-I would stay here for the moment.
-He's right, Carly, stay.

38:47.783 --> 38:50.828
I'm on for 800 for a reception afterwards.

38:50.911 --> 38:51.746
Shut up, Daddy!

38:51.829 --> 38:54.498
I think we may have
to go candid here, all right?

38:55.249 --> 38:57.084
Is there an understandin'
of what I'm sayin'?

38:57.168 --> 38:59.295
(stammers)
I mean, uh... what do you mean, candid?

38:59.545 --> 39:01.964
I mean, Severino's color ain't too great.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.301
-What do you think, Carlotta?
-What's he talkin' about?

39:06.260 --> 39:07.303
Whatever's right.

39:08.929 --> 39:11.057
(choking)

39:11.807 --> 39:13.267
Tommy, Tommy, hey, hey.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.560
-What do you want, J.D.?
-Come on. Come on.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.520
(choking) Tommy, could you
move your thumbs just a little?

39:16.604 --> 39:18.606
Y-you got your thumbs
right on my windpipe.

39:18.689 --> 39:21.400
-Move your thumbs, Tommy.
-Think I wanna do this, huh?

39:21.484 --> 39:23.110
Oh, thanks. Oh, God.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.236
What would you do?

39:24.653 --> 39:26.030
My best man!

39:26.113 --> 39:29.408
Depends, depends on who else was involved.

39:29.492 --> 39:30.785
What do you mean?

39:30.868 --> 39:34.997
Tommy, nobody wants to throw stones here,
but the truth is, before marriage,

39:35.081 --> 39:38.084
some people are sexually active.

39:38.167 --> 39:42.755
(stutters) And I think that
that might possibly just be the case here.

39:43.297 --> 39:44.673
-Carlotta?
-Carlotta.

39:47.843 --> 39:51.180
-How many more, Carlotta, huh?
-Oh, God!

39:51.263 --> 39:52.390
How many?

39:52.473 --> 39:56.060
-Let Severino go, would you, Tommy?
-How many?

39:56.143 --> 39:57.520
So, Tommy, I was watching
this movie last night.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.230
It's Frank Sinatra and Jack Hawkins.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.358
And Hawkins is telling Sinatra
about this tribe

40:02.441 --> 40:05.611
that's only got the numbers
one, two, and three.

40:05.694 --> 40:06.862
What are you talkin' about?

40:06.946 --> 40:09.657
Above that, all this tribe says is,

40:11.033 --> 40:12.451
"More than three."

40:12.993 --> 40:15.204
It's their only other number.

40:15.788 --> 40:19.375
-Hmm.
-(gags) Oh, Tommy, thanks.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.180
All right, okay, all right.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.349
The thing's got a combination
to it, all right?

40:35.433 --> 40:37.101
I stole it from a warehouse.

40:37.184 --> 40:39.186
-There, all right?
-All right.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.230
All right, listen, you got me
scared now, I'm tellin' you.

40:41.313 --> 40:44.024
I'm afraid I'm gonna open the safe
and you're gonna blow my head off.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.860
-Go on, do it, man!
-It's okay, man, he's cool.

40:45.943 --> 40:47.570
He's afraid! We're both afraid!

40:47.653 --> 40:48.988
I'm afraid that I'm gonna open the safe

40:49.071 --> 40:50.739
and, uh, that's when
you're gonna do it to me.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.783
-That's when you won't need me anymore.
-Open it, man!

40:52.867 --> 40:55.077
All right, I'm scared, all right?
You got me afraid that--

40:55.161 --> 40:56.871
That you're gonna do it to me then--

40:56.954 --> 40:58.330
You don't open it
or I'll blow your face off!

40:58.414 --> 40:59.790
I'll blow your head off right now!

40:59.874 --> 41:01.000
You better do it, man.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.043
Okay, I'm gonna do it now.
I'm opening the safe now, see.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.712
-Please.
-I'm opening the safe now.

41:04.795 --> 41:05.754
I'm opening it up, please.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.299
-Open it or I'll shoot you!
-Just take it easy.

41:08.382 --> 41:10.176
Oh, my God, please, don't kill us.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.594
-Don't kill us!
-I'm opening it!

41:11.677 --> 41:13.304
I'm opening the safe.
All right, take it easy.

41:13.387 --> 41:15.347
Open it or I'll shoot you now!

41:15.431 --> 41:17.391
-All right, all right, God.
-I'm opening it up.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.060
All right, take it easy.
I'm opening it up.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.395
You're opening it now, Norm?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.522
I'm on the last number now,
Sid, you hear me?

41:23.606 --> 41:25.608
Please, don't kill me!

41:25.691 --> 41:27.026
-Norm, I'm taking him now!
-Get away from...

41:27.109 --> 41:29.862
-You son of a...
-(gunshot)

41:35.326 --> 41:36.827
(sobbing)

41:36.911 --> 41:38.704
(panting)

41:38.787 --> 41:41.457
Oh... Norm.

41:47.213 --> 41:48.797
You're a jerk for coming back.

41:48.881 --> 41:51.050
Now Lenny's gonna get crazy.

41:51.842 --> 41:53.302
What is this?

41:54.553 --> 41:56.639
The glutton for punishment contest?

41:57.264 --> 41:59.934
<i>Uh, cerveza. Cerveza fria.</i>

42:00.017 --> 42:01.936
Yeah, beer? What else?

42:02.269 --> 42:06.482
-I'm tired. I want a room.
-Unbelievable.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.817
-Do I get a room?
-(scoffing)

42:09.401 --> 42:11.820
You get nothin'. You get hurt!

42:12.571 --> 42:16.116
-(grunting)
-(growling)

42:16.200 --> 42:17.284
(groaning)

42:17.368 --> 42:20.287
When do I get hurt, slime face? Huh?

42:20.371 --> 42:22.873
Immigration, hold it! You're under arrest.

42:24.166 --> 42:28.671
I'm a police officer, and you are busted!

42:28.754 --> 42:31.966
(police siren in distance)

42:32.049 --> 42:34.385
I'm going to be moving
back to my apartment.

42:35.052 --> 42:38.430
In the mornings, Mrs. Harrison's
gonna make you your breakfast.

42:38.514 --> 42:41.267
-Oh?
-Brenda told me just how you like it.

42:41.350 --> 42:42.351
How 'bout that?

42:42.434 --> 42:45.563
And, um, Meals on Wheels
is gonna come by during the day,

42:45.646 --> 42:48.440
and I'll have supper with you every night.

42:48.524 --> 42:51.694
Is it 'cause I made a mistake
about the pork chop the other night?

42:53.112 --> 42:54.530
Are you in trouble, Brenda?

42:56.532 --> 42:58.701
It's gonna be better for us now, Grandma.

42:58.784 --> 43:01.161
I was trying to do too much,

43:01.245 --> 43:04.039
and it made me upset.

43:05.040 --> 43:08.502
And so I wasn't helping you at all.

43:10.296 --> 43:13.090
It's gonna be better for us now.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.466
No thanks, Puddin'.

43:15.384 --> 43:17.052
I don't believe I could eat a thing.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.265
You really think it's gonna work?

43:21.807 --> 43:23.267
I don't know. Maybe.

43:23.851 --> 43:24.893
Oh, yeah.

43:26.353 --> 43:27.855
Don't get old, Renko.

43:28.397 --> 43:29.773
I'm gonna start lying about my age.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.483
-(door opens)
-That won't get it.

43:44.622 --> 43:47.374
I just want to point out
a fact to you, Norman.

43:48.751 --> 43:50.669
There's a car parked out in front

43:51.587 --> 43:53.255
with a suitcase in the trunk.

43:53.839 --> 43:56.216
And it doesn't have
to be a part of any of this.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.969
Forget it, Sid.

43:59.887 --> 44:02.514
I'm just sayin'.
I'm just makin' an observation.

44:03.182 --> 44:05.017
-No shot.
-Police.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.518
-(knocking on door)
-Yeah, yeah.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.187
Lieutenant Buntz, Hill Street.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.522
These here.

44:12.316 --> 44:17.112
Also, there's an associated 14-17,
third floor loft, Dekker and Swenson.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.866
Also got a crack wagon parked outside.

44:21.408 --> 44:23.369
There's a suitcase
full of soda in the trunk.

44:23.786 --> 44:27.081
-It's a burgundy Cutlass.
-This the perp?

44:28.916 --> 44:29.917
No.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.546
No, just an impoverished citizen.

44:43.305 --> 44:44.640
How did your keys get there?

44:45.182 --> 44:46.475
I put them there.

44:47.685 --> 44:48.686
You sure?

44:50.354 --> 44:52.606
When did you pass the bar exam, Furillo?

44:52.690 --> 44:54.525
I found them in the door when I came in.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.277
-You're kidding?
-Would I kid you?

44:59.530 --> 45:01.865
Portrait of a person spread so thin,

45:01.949 --> 45:05.160
she doesn't know
if she's on foot or horseback.

45:05.786 --> 45:09.623
I'd say it's the portrait of a person
keeping 12 plates spinning in the air.

45:12.251 --> 45:15.462
How come I see them all teetering
and falling to the floor?

45:15.546 --> 45:16.755
Could be worse.

45:16.839 --> 45:19.133
Could've been on that plane
that crashed on Ingram Avenue.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.510
In which case,
I would've been a dope smuggler.

45:21.593 --> 45:24.680
(chuckling)

45:24.763 --> 45:27.099
(phone ringing)

45:29.017 --> 45:30.018
Hello?

45:31.854 --> 45:32.771
Yes, Nate.

45:37.067 --> 45:38.068
All right.

45:39.653 --> 45:40.988
Thank you for calling.

45:43.282 --> 45:45.159
-(hangs up phone)
-What's wrong?

45:46.744 --> 45:49.621
Someone I represented
until this morning...

45:50.414 --> 45:51.498
Arthur Baker.

45:52.833 --> 45:55.794
He was a frightened,
little drug addict and thief,

45:55.878 --> 45:59.214
and he was stabbed
at Michigan Avenue holding.

46:04.178 --> 46:05.596
Oh, God.

46:06.221 --> 46:08.474
I wonder if they heard me talking.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.309
Who?

46:11.435 --> 46:12.853
(sighs)

46:16.482 --> 46:19.818
The kid who killed him was one of the kids

46:19.902 --> 46:21.487
that I did intake on today,

46:21.570 --> 46:24.656
and maybe he heard me
talking to his lawyer

46:24.740 --> 46:26.700
about Arthur being an informant.

46:28.118 --> 46:28.952
(exhaling)

46:34.333 --> 46:35.793
Oh, Frank.

46:38.587 --> 46:40.255
All those plates.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.179
(sniffles, sighs)

46:47.763 --> 46:49.223
And all of them spinning.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.230
-(dog barking)
-If we see him again,

46:56.313 --> 46:57.981
we should make him give us money.

46:58.065 --> 47:00.234
If I see him again,
he better have eyes behind his head,

47:00.317 --> 47:01.735
'cause I'mma hit him with a brick.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.780
-What do you think was in it?
-In that suitcase?

47:05.739 --> 47:07.032
Drugs.

47:07.115 --> 47:09.785
I bet it was money,
enough money to make you rich.

47:09.868 --> 47:11.745
Maybe they were going someplace.

47:11.829 --> 47:13.622
Going away to the islands.

47:24.550 --> 47:27.177
(footsteps fading)

47:29.680 --> 47:32.057
(door closing)

47:49.867 --> 47:52.494
-(footsteps approaching)
-(light clicks)

48:02.880 --> 48:05.757
(closing theme playing)
