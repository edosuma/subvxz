{\an8}(Kirk)
Previously on
"Floribama Shore"...

00:05.939 --> 00:08.908
{\an8}This is the perfect opportunity
to see where this could go.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.277
{\an8}♪♪

00:11.344 --> 00:13.680
{\an8}I'm instantly like,
oop, there's Jules.

00:13.747 --> 00:17.717
{\an8}I'm putting all my eggs
in this basket again.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.886
{\an8}Are you (bleep) serious?

00:19.953 --> 00:21.154
{\an8}I'll be there in just a sec.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.224
{\an8}She's in my bed right now.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.092
{\an8}You can sleep in mine.

00:29.028 --> 00:30.397
{\an8}I'm (bleep) done with Gus.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.332
{\an8}It's just a (bleep) bed.

00:32.399 --> 00:37.637
{\an8}It's not like we're having sex,
making out, blah, blah, blah.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.105
{\an8}I wanna create
some Mexican momentum.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.774
{\an8}I don't wanna go back
to the hotel room.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.410
{\an8}Some fun,
something adventurous,
let's (bleep) do it.

00:43.476 --> 00:44.811
{\an8}We're doing what?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.781
{\an8}♪♪

00:47.847 --> 00:50.984
{\an8}Candace is not going
to handle this well.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.419
{\an7}(Bleep), this is
already stressful,

00:52.485 --> 00:56.189
{\an7}and y'all put glass
as the floor.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.824
{\an8}♪♪

01:01.161 --> 01:03.196
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Welcome to Panama City beach!

01:03.263 --> 01:05.698

Candace! Aimee!
Candace! Aimee!

01:22.449 --> 01:24.083
{\an8}Candace! Aimee!

01:24.150 --> 01:25.452
{\an8}(Candace)
I'm so scared.

01:25.518 --> 01:26.753
{\an8}(Aimee)
Can we check it like
five extra times

01:26.820 --> 01:29.222
{\an8}to make sure I am
hooked all the way in?

01:29.289 --> 01:30.623
Is this supposed
to be this loose?

01:30.690 --> 01:32.525
{\an3}<i>Si.</i>

01:30.690 --> 01:32.525
{\an1}Okay.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.260
{\an5}Sir, I'm so scared.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.260
{\an3}It's okay.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.396
{\an8}I have to tackle
one fear at a time.

01:36.463 --> 01:37.664
{\an8}You know,
this is a lot on me.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.833
{\an8}I just learned how to swim,

01:39.899 --> 01:41.968
{\an8}and now you want me
to jump 300 feet?

01:42.035 --> 01:44.671
Like, Cabo is asking
a lot of me right now.

01:44.737 --> 01:45.905
And so what do I do?

01:45.972 --> 01:47.207
{\an4}(Aimee)
I feel like I'm
gonna pass out.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.608
Step down with us.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.143
Okay, what do I hold onto?

01:50.210 --> 01:52.712
{\an5}Here.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.712
Sir, I'm so scared.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.880
{\an5}And now...

01:52.779 --> 01:53.880
{\an1}(Aimee)
Can I sit down?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.348
{\an1}My breathing's gettin'
a little messed up.

01:55.415 --> 01:59.118
{\an8}This swing looks like it's on
a top of the mountain

01:59.185 --> 02:01.654
and you just drop
to your death.

02:01.721 --> 02:04.157
Who does this (bleep) for fun?
Who does this?

02:04.224 --> 02:06.292
{\an4}(man)
Okay, chicas.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.292
(Candace)
Wait, please.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.627
Please, sir, please.
I'm just-- please, I'm scared.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.562
{\an1}You have to put your hands
on the strap then slide out.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.832
{\an6}(groans)

02:10.630 --> 02:12.832
Sir...

02:12.899 --> 02:14.167
Sir, can you help me please?

02:14.234 --> 02:15.902
I just-- I just-- help me.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.704
Give me something
to help me mentally.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.740
I just am so nervous.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.742
{\an5}(man)
This is just
a new adventure for you.

02:22.809 --> 02:26.179
You're gonna be doing things
you have never done before.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.114
(Candace)
I just am so nervous.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.016
He's talking to her.
I can guarantee

02:30.083 --> 02:31.384
{\an5}he's talking to her
right now.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.384
Yep.

02:31.451 --> 02:32.986
That's why he's like,
down there like that.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.454
As soon as I pull you back,

02:34.521 --> 02:36.389
your smile's gonna
be like, this big.

02:36.456 --> 02:40.226
{\an1}From ear to ear, okay?
I promise that. I can bet.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.494
I know it's
a little bit scary

02:41.561 --> 02:42.996
at the beginning,
but it doesn't matter.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.298
Why? Because it's just
a new experience for you.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.000
So just try
to think positive.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.835
I'd just push 'em out if I--

02:48.902 --> 02:51.404
if that were my job.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.573
What?! What is that?!

02:53.640 --> 02:55.041
You got it, girls!

02:55.108 --> 02:56.776
{\an5}I got you.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.776
You promise?

02:56.843 --> 02:58.378
{\an5}I promise.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.378
You promise I'm safe?

02:58.444 --> 03:01.080
Hey, I promise.
Got it?

03:01.147 --> 03:02.682
<i>Muy bien.</i>
I need you to slide out.

03:02.749 --> 03:03.883
I'm holding you here.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.319
(Aimee whimpering)

03:06.386 --> 03:10.023
Oh God!
I don't like it.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.691
I don't like it neither.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.126
Aimee, like, ain't you
supposed to be he--

03:13.192 --> 03:14.561
like, making me feel better?

03:14.627 --> 03:16.996
Aimee ain't helpin' it.
Aimee's scared too.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.264
{\an5}Sir, is this safe?

03:17.063 --> 03:18.264
(Aimee whimpering)

03:18.331 --> 03:20.500
Wait, sir, wait.
Is it--

03:20.567 --> 03:23.403
{\an5}Sir, wait. Wait,
I'm stuck to the thing.

03:20.567 --> 03:23.403
(Aimee)
Oh, I'm scared.

Candace! Aimee!

03:27.173 --> 03:29.042
Candace! Aimee! Candace!

03:29.108 --> 03:32.178
Three, two, one...

03:32.245 --> 03:35.381
Jesus, please just
let me survive.

03:35.448 --> 03:36.983
Please, Jesus, don't let us die.
Please don't let us die.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.602
Way to go, girls!

03:55.668 --> 03:57.470
Yeah, y'all did it!

03:57.537 --> 03:59.672
{\an5}We did it!

03:57.537 --> 03:59.672
Yeah, we did it!

03:59.739 --> 04:00.840
(Aimee)
We did it.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.175
{\an1}(Candace)
Oh, it looks like Africa.

04:02.241 --> 04:05.111
{\an5}We did it!

04:02.241 --> 04:05.111
Oh my God,
Mexico is beautiful.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.981
I feel like I have just
conquered the world.

04:08.047 --> 04:10.516
I feel like
I can do anything.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.251
{\an5}(Aimee)
I was crying.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.251
{\an1}(Candace)
I was crying.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.988
{\an1}That initial drop
is some bull(bleep).

04:15.054 --> 04:17.656
{\an5}(Aimee)
I love you.

04:15.054 --> 04:17.656
(both laughing)

04:17.724 --> 04:19.726
{\an5}I'm glad I got
to do it with you.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.726
Oh, (bleep).

04:19.791 --> 04:21.594
Look at my hands.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.262
I'm shakin'.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.064
I'm very proud of Candace.

04:25.131 --> 04:28.067
Candace is terrified
of heights, water,

04:28.134 --> 04:29.569
and getting her hair wet,
and she's did

04:29.636 --> 04:32.105
all three of those things,
I'm very proud of Candace.

04:32.171 --> 04:35.875
{\an5}Way to go, ladies!

04:32.171 --> 04:35.875
That-a-girl!

04:35.942 --> 04:37.377
We did it!

04:37.443 --> 04:39.412

(Jeremiah)
Yes, you did!

04:40.813 --> 04:43.116
Yeah, that's right.
We did it, bitches.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.985
{\an5}Thank you.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.985
Oh, so proud of you, girl.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.086
Y'all, I can't believe
I did that.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.655
Great job, you guys.

04:48.721 --> 04:49.922
{\an8}I'm extremely proud
of Candace.

04:49.989 --> 04:52.358
She's come out of her shell.
Who is this?

04:52.425 --> 04:54.093
I wanna go.
(laughing)

04:54.160 --> 04:55.595
{\an8}I'm so excited like, really.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.130
{\an8}Like, I'm for stuff
like this.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.265
Holy (bleep), bro,
you ready for this?

04:59.332 --> 05:01.167
Dear Lord.
Here, hold my hand.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.402
Lord, hope that
we don't pass out,

05:02.468 --> 05:03.636
hope we don't throw up,
and hope we don't

05:03.703 --> 05:05.104
(bleep) on ourselves,
Lord, please.

05:05.171 --> 05:06.272
Oh my God.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.908
(man)
Three, two, one...

05:08.975 --> 05:11.944
(screaming)

05:12.011 --> 05:19.686
{\an5}(screaming)

05:12.011 --> 05:19.686
Holy (bleep)!

05:19.752 --> 05:22.689

05:19.752 --> 05:22.689
{\an1}My God!

05:22.755 --> 05:24.991
{\an5}Just went straight down.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.991
Holy (bleep).

05:25.058 --> 05:27.093
I'm not gonna lie,
(bleep)'s pretty scary.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.762
Oh my gosh.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.864
{\an5}The most funnest thing...

05:29.829 --> 05:31.864
Lotta fun.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.500
{\an1}...I've ever done
in my life.

05:34.567 --> 05:38.337
{\an1}Hey! You did it!
We did it!

05:38.404 --> 05:39.972
All right, so can we go
get some dranks?

05:40.039 --> 05:42.341
{\an1}Good job, you guys.
Oh my God, that was a blast.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.143
{\an5}(Nilsa)
I'm gonna throw up real quick,
you go ahead and go.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.745
No, I'll wait for you.

05:45.812 --> 05:47.313
She's pukin'.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.581
(Kirk)
So are you gonna help her

05:48.648 --> 05:50.516
like not puke or something?
I mean...

05:50.583 --> 05:52.785
Nilsa has no shame with
her puking game right now.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.320
It's like,
in the middle of the park.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.855
People are watching.
Just... (retches).

05:55.922 --> 05:58.591
Yakkin'. And of course,
Gus is stuck taking care of her.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.159
He can't help himself.

06:00.226 --> 06:01.594
She's just sick,

06:01.661 --> 06:02.995
drank a little
too much last night.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.831
{\an5}(Gus)
You know, unfortunately
Nilsa ends up

06:04.897 --> 06:06.099
{\an8}not being able to do the ride
just because she's so sick

06:06.165 --> 06:07.567
{\an8}from drinking
too much last night.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.302
{\an8}Which sucks, because
I know Nilsa would've done it.

06:09.368 --> 06:11.604
{\an8}She's always been more
of the adventurous type.

06:12.905 --> 06:14.640
Hey, Nilsa, you want
any food or anything?

06:14.707 --> 06:16.075
You know, obviously there's
been a lot of history

06:16.142 --> 06:18.778
between me and Nilsa,
and I see her over there,

06:18.845 --> 06:20.747
she looks sick, she looks like
she's having a terrible time

06:20.813 --> 06:22.215
and since it's Nilsa,
I feel like

06:22.281 --> 06:24.050
I need to go out of my way
to make sure she's good

06:24.117 --> 06:26.352
and that she's not completely
miserable doing all of this

06:26.419 --> 06:27.620
while we're having
a good time.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.821
{\an1}It's gonna turn around,
I promise.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.091
{\an1}It's just-- it's about
an eight hour bug.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.160
{\an1}You get it all out,
and then you'll be golden.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.062
{\an8}Gus is like, trying
to take care of me.

06:36.129 --> 06:40.399
{\an8}And I'm like, oh, come on,
I look horrible right now.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.435
The worst part's
coming to an end.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.203
I'm pukin' my guts up.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.373
Any other time
would be great, but now?

06:47.440 --> 06:50.476
{\an5}You guys, here's to
the biggest swing
we've ever been on.

06:50.543 --> 06:53.146
{\an3}Cheers.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.847
Eight dysfunctional roommates

06:54.914 --> 06:57.116
{\an1}just did some crazy (bleep)
in Cabo, man.

06:57.183 --> 06:58.985
And we're not even done yet.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.604
{\an8}(Kirk laughing)

07:19.872 --> 07:22.175
{\an1}So I saw Gus was
pampering you today.

07:22.241 --> 07:23.843
{\an5}(Nilsa)
He was being
really sweet.

07:23.910 --> 07:27.513
He was being sweet...

07:27.580 --> 07:30.216
but him and Kortni slept in
the bed together last night.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.385
{\an5}I thought he was
in bed with you.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.385
{\an3}No.

♪♪

07:36.055 --> 07:37.857
{\an8}I woke up to go
wake Candace up and...

07:40.393 --> 07:41.894
{\an7}You know it's nothing
like that, though.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.131
{\an7}It would be like if I went
and snuggled up to Jeremiah.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.599
'Cause she has

into the bathroom, 'cause I
can't deal with this (bleep).

31:20.612 --> 31:22.714
I swear to God, if someone
touches someone else's hand,

31:22.780 --> 31:24.015

If I wanted Gus'
(bleep) in my mouth,

I would've sucked it
a long (bleep) time ago.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.463
After everything Gus
has said about Nilsa,

31:38.529 --> 31:41.366
he should be real with her,
not holding her hand.

31:41.432 --> 31:44.602

Kortni's upset because
Gus is cool with Nilsa,

shouldn't they be cool?

32:02.820 --> 32:04.689
They have sex, like...

32:04.756 --> 32:07.191
I feel like you should be cool
with that people you bang.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.393
And I'm happy
that they're cool

32:08.459 --> 32:09.927
'cause I'm tired
of them beefing.

why she's upset about that,

any reason to be upset.

32:14.565 --> 32:17.635
I kept Gus
from (bleep) Nilsa

32:17.702 --> 32:19.604

made him feel bad

whenever he was sober.

32:21.906 --> 32:23.308
{\an5}He said that it would...

32:21.906 --> 32:23.308
I tried to be

32:23.374 --> 32:24.776
a good (bleep) friend.

32:24.842 --> 32:26.744
No, I (bleep) know him.

did he (bleep) not,

he stuck his (bleep)

32:32.450 --> 32:34.485
in Nilsa's vagina.

32:34.552 --> 32:36.788
{\an5}And now he's out there

32:36.854 --> 32:39.324
{\an1}saying whatever the (bleep)
that he's saying,

32:39.390 --> 32:41.893

"Ohh! Mwah!"

can do better than that.

{\an1}Growing up, if something
were to happen,

38:00.411 --> 38:02.913
my mom would literally
be like, "Suck it up.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.248
You're fine."

38:04.315 --> 38:07.284
{\an1}So I was raised
to be tough,

38:07.351 --> 38:10.121
{\an1}and to not be
upset about that.

38:10.187 --> 38:13.057
I've said I'm sorry,

38:13.124 --> 38:14.825
{\an1}and I mean it
whenever I'm sorry.

38:14.892 --> 38:16.627
{\an1}I did not know that
you were behind that door.

38:16.694 --> 38:18.229
But I am sorry,

38:18.295 --> 38:20.731
{\an1}and I'm sorry
that I laughed.

38:20.798 --> 38:23.034
{\an1}I'm sorry that I'm a bitch
in this situation

38:23.100 --> 38:24.301
and I laughed,

38:24.368 --> 38:26.070
{\an1}and I will apologize
about that.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.172
This was
a legitimate accident.

38:28.239 --> 38:29.974
If I wanted to break
Nilsa's nose,

38:30.041 --> 38:31.409
I am very capable

38:31.475 --> 38:32.910
and it would be hanging
off of her face.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.079
I do suggest that
you take Tylenol,

38:35.146 --> 38:36.380
{\an1}'cause it
really does help,

38:36.447 --> 38:38.249
because I've broken
my nose three times.

38:38.315 --> 38:39.917
♪♪

38:39.984 --> 38:42.119
I am who I am,
she is who she is.

38:42.186 --> 38:45.389
If she wants to cry about it
all night long, she can.

38:45.456 --> 38:48.359
Me? I turn around,
I laugh about it.

38:48.426 --> 38:51.028
I'm not gonna feel sorry
for somebody,

38:51.095 --> 38:53.497
but I did apologize

38:53.564 --> 38:55.366
because I pushed a door open

38:55.433 --> 38:58.135
not knowing
she was on the other side.

38:58.202 --> 39:00.938
I am obviously not welcome.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.306
We have to be up
early in the morning.

39:02.373 --> 39:03.607
I know, that's why
I'm trying to get to sleep.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.009
Do you guys have
your bags packed already?

39:05.076 --> 39:06.310
{\an5}(Candace)
Most of my stuff
is already packed.

39:06.377 --> 39:08.079
My stuff is...

39:08.145 --> 39:09.613
{\an4}I have everything packed,
but what I need...

39:08.145 --> 39:09.613
...halfway zipped up.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.248
{\an5}I got my outfit...

39:09.680 --> 39:11.248
{\an1}...my shampoo,
(bleep) like that.

39:11.315 --> 39:12.650
So we're all set?

39:12.717 --> 39:14.452
Did she say sorry
when we were in the bathroom?

39:14.518 --> 39:16.353
{\an6}Honestly...

39:14.518 --> 39:16.353
I don't think she did.

39:16.420 --> 39:18.689
Nilsa, I was so concerned
with trying to get you

39:18.756 --> 39:20.558
ice and stuff like that,
I don't know if she did.

39:20.624 --> 39:21.659
I can't say if she did
or she didn't.

39:21.726 --> 39:23.194
She didn't.

39:23.260 --> 39:24.528
She didn't,
and I knew she didn't,

39:24.595 --> 39:26.197
but she told me
that she said she did

39:26.263 --> 39:27.465
{\an8}but she did not apologize

39:27.531 --> 39:29.100
{\an8}until we got back
to the hotel.

39:29.166 --> 39:31.635
{\an8}And was she not laughing
in the taxi?

39:31.702 --> 39:33.304
{\an8}And that's what hurt
my feelings even more.

39:33.370 --> 39:34.638
{\an8}And it was an accident.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.040
{\an8}She did not mean
to do that.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.375
{\an8}She really didn't.
That was 100% accident.

39:38.442 --> 39:40.010
{\an7}But she sat there
and laughed afterwards.

39:40.077 --> 39:41.846
{\an8}She even came in the room.

39:40.077 --> 39:41.846
{\an8}She did, she did.

39:41.912 --> 39:43.114
{\an8}And that was,
that was wrong.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.315
{\an8}She should have
tried to help you.

39:44.381 --> 39:46.350
{\an8}But she really
did not mean to do it.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.219
{\an8}I just don't know
the type of people

39:48.285 --> 39:50.821
{\an8}that think inflicting physical
pain on someone else is funny.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.590
{\an7}I don't know
those type of people.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.590
{\an5}It's not funny.

39:52.656 --> 39:54.191
{\an7}I don't know any people
like that.
