of the entire hotel.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.719
Well, I would’ve thought
it would be room service.

00:16.809 --> 00:19.095
No way. Proper washing
at this volume...

00:19.187 --> 00:22.054
depends on water quality,
bleach concentration,

00:22.148 --> 00:25.015
time and, of course,
agitation and heat.

00:25.109 --> 00:28.522
Agitation and heat, yeah.
I definitely got that.

is if someone threw it
down the laundry chute.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.528

to suggest homicide.
Yes, it would.

I’m not sure why you’d want
to wear frolicking cetaceans
around your neck.

Look, they’re little dolphins.

Yeah.
Yeah, it was a present.

Good luck on the ID.

01:34.512 --> 01:36.719
Too bad they didn’t do him
on the delicate cycle, huh?

01:36.806 --> 01:40.799
Obviously the manufacturers
didn’t anticipate human remains.

01:40.893 --> 01:44.101
According to the laundry guy,
the body could’ve been sittin’
in a pile of dirty sheets...

01:44.188 --> 01:46.224
for two days before
it got thrown into the wash.

01:52.863 --> 01:56.230
Judging by the concavity
of the rib end,

01:56.325 --> 01:58.611
the victim was middle-aged.

01:58.703 --> 02:02.946
Dismemberment occurred
postmortem— most likely
during the spin cycle.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.782
- What’s so interesting about my tie?
- A gift is a social contract.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.787
A basic
anthropological construct.

02:07.878 --> 02:12.292
By giving you the tie,
Catherine has entered into
a social contract with you.

Everything’s swollen.

Speaking of social contracts,
do you like your gynecologist?

She’s extremely competent, yes.
But I don’t think
she’s accepting new patients.

Listen. Can you two just
save the lady-part discussion
for when I’m not here?

02:30.985 --> 02:36.070
Dr. Oksenberg moved
to California. And I am looking
for a doctor for Michelle.

There’s also bone degeneration
on the mandible.

three years old.

04:30.229 --> 04:33.221

typical for professional

A number of mostly repaired

in the tibia and tarsus.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.965
An injury pattern most commonly
sustained by rock climbers.

05:02.052 --> 05:05.465

about a year after the hamate fracture.

05:11.979 --> 05:16.473
With an accompanying
micro fracture on the parietal.

- But the other testicle
seems to have vanished.
- Well, it’s not here.

in the habit of injuring himself annually...

05:45.763 --> 05:47.674

06:06.909 --> 06:09.366
such as cigar smoking
and risk taking,

could be a form of
overcompensation in a man who
was born with only one testicle.

- There’s no reason to assume
the victim was born without one.

have lost it in one of
his dangerous pursuits.

to some sort of trauma...

Trauma? My God.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.316
Uh, why would you
bring up trauma?

deeper issues at play.

mostly denim, a chain—

also most likely
part of the victim’s apparel—

09:25.607 --> 09:28.394
some pieces of molded
silicone elastomer.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.655

- Oh, God.

09:34.742 --> 09:38.530
It’s a prosthetic one.
They’re made of a silicone shell
and filled with saline.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.908
Obviously this has suffered
a lot of damage in the wash.

09:41.999 --> 09:45.912

we can get an ID.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.119
[Whimpers ]

09:49.465 --> 09:51.877

to reassemble

Yeah. Hopefully by
looking at the image under
different color filters,

10:02.186 --> 10:04.677
we can at least
get some of the digits.

10:04.772 --> 10:08.435
You know,
I have to say that this whole
“finding ID. by testicle”...

10:08.525 --> 10:10.516
definitely beats
facial reconstructions.

10:10.611 --> 10:14.149
Does that prosthetic seem
overly large to you?

10:14.239 --> 10:17.447
Well, it—
it isn’t to scale, Cam.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.400
- Fantasy camps?
- They’re expensive camps...

10:58.492 --> 11:00.653
where grown-ups, they get
to pretend to be, you know,

race car drivers, uh,
professional ball players,
pretty much anything.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.904

According
to Cole ’5 lawyer;

11:41.910 --> 11:44.868
he was trying to buy
a property that Simon Graham
didn’t want him to have.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.446
You think Graham murdered Cole
to safeguard some property?

11:47.541 --> 11:49.623
It’s possible.
But don’t say
that Cole is dead.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.871
I don’t want
anybody panicking
or trying to flee the scene.

that he ever played
came from a video game.

about their picks.

21:09.018 --> 21:12.727
I had some campers over
Tuesday night. Gives ’em
a story to tell their friends.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.066
- There’s blood on the carpet.
- Ooh.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.566
I don’t know
anything about that.
When things got wild, I left.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.363
Caught a cab across town
and spent some quality time
with a girlfriend.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.407
Well, I’m gonna need
that girlfriend’s
name and number.

21:26.494 --> 21:29.861
- And I’m gonna
need this carpet.
- Sure.

21:37.672 --> 21:40.414
Hey, how’d it go?
Fine.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.964
You really didn’t need
to come with me.

21:42.051 --> 21:45.043
Well, ljust
wanted to make sure
you were comfortable.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.675
Sure. He’s cool.
Easy to talk to.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.926
Good.
That’s excellent.

21:50.018 --> 21:53.476
Uh, excuse me, Dr. Saroyan.
Um, do you have a minute?

21:53.563 --> 21:56.851
- Couple of
insurance questions is all.
- Sure.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.977
I’ll be back in a minute.

22:03.239 --> 22:07.448
Is there a problem
with Michelle?
No, no, no, no. She’s great.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.400
In perfect health.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.954
And she spoke to you
about things.

22:13.041 --> 22:16.033
Confidential things, yeah.

22:16.127 --> 22:18.038
I can tell you
she’s a wonderful girl.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.791
But that’s not why
I wanted to talk to you.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.964
Right. Insurance.

22:23.051 --> 22:27.169
Uh, not about
insurance either. No.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.640
- Now I’m stumped.
- [Chuckles]

22:29.724 --> 22:32.010
Um, I just thought—

22:32.101 --> 22:37.095
Would it be weird
if / asked you to, uh,
go out with me sometime?

22:37.190 --> 22:41.308
Ye— Yes. That—
That, uh, would be weird.

22:41.402 --> 22:45.111
- Of course. Very weird.
- Yeah, right? It is weird.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.734
Totally. Totally weird.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.657
But, um,
I would say yes.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.862
Really?

22:53.957 --> 22:56.073
That’s great.

22:56.167 --> 22:59.034
Does that mean
you’re asking?

22:59.128 --> 23:02.791
- [ Cell Phone Rings]
- Oh, I’m sorry. Excuse me.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.090
- Work. I’ve gotta go.
- Oh, I— I am though.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.554
- What?
- Asking.

23:08.638 --> 23:12.130
- I’ll call you?
- I would like that.

23:16.563 --> 23:20.055
So we know
that the micro fractures
radiate out of each trauma site.

23:20.149 --> 23:23.858
These micro fractures expand
until they run into
other radiating fractures...

23:23.945 --> 23:25.901
which were created
by earlier trauma wounds.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.696
Now the trick
is to separate out
those points of trauma...

23:28.783 --> 23:31.274
where the radiating
micro fractures
just keep going...

23:31.369 --> 23:34.406
because there were
no earlier fractures
to cross paths with.

23:34.497 --> 23:37.330
In this way, we can identify
the perimortem fractures...

23:37.417 --> 23:41.535
and therefore determine that
the cause of death was trauma
to the skull and chest cavity.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.870
Cole was beaten to death.
Excellent work.

23:43.965 --> 23:47.423
- Thank you. And Angela,
of course. Double play, right?
- Yeah.

23:47.510 --> 23:50.001
I assume you were
talking about baseball again.

23:50.096 --> 23:53.509
- Although I have no idea why.
- Well, it’s baseball season, sweetie.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.592
This is when boys
like to hit balls with sticks
when the snow melts.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.893
I don’t know why.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.642
Oh. Well, what about
the murder weapon?

24:01.733 --> 24:04.349
I’m gonna make castings
of the pertinent injuries.

24:04.444 --> 24:08.778
I’m making him 3-D scans
so he can focus on all
the unremodeled fractures.

24:08.865 --> 24:12.198
Sweets would probably say
that the need to hit balls
with a large stick...

24:12.285 --> 24:14.776
shows that you’re insecure
with your manhood.

24:14.871 --> 24:18.409
- I can assure you—
- I think it’s probably
just enjoyable to hit things.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.750
[Chuckles]

24:22.837 --> 24:27.206
Erik Dalton’s hotel room’s
a good bet for the murder scene.
We found two sets of DNA.

24:27.342 --> 24:29.833
So, two people
bled on this carpet?
Yes.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.963
The first set of DNA.
belonged to our victim.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.216
Perhaps the second set
belongs to our killer.

24:34.307 --> 24:37.515
I found traces of Klonopin
in the mystery blood.

24:37.602 --> 24:42.141
Which means whoever
it belongs to either has
a panic disorder or epilepsy.

24:42.231 --> 24:47.396
We should cross-reference
the list of campers with
the prescription drug database.

24:49.197 --> 24:51.108
Booth seems to like Catherine,
don’t you think?

24:51.199 --> 24:54.737
I do. I’m glad.
It’s been a long time
since he’s dated anyone.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.284
I know. It’s important
for Booth to share his life.

24:57.372 --> 25:00.330
- I prefer being alone.
- But you’re seeing Hacker.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.533
Yes. And I like him.
But not like Booth.

25:03.628 --> 25:06.335

involving a commitment
to another person are remote.

I’d be dating now.
Yet I am.

is amazing.

in an article called...

told me l’m gonna be a star.

told her I wanted
to take a break.

he deserved it.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.162
Angela scanned the castings
I made of the fatal injuries...

29:59.256 --> 30:01.588
so we can get a better sense
of the murder weapon.

30:01.676 --> 30:04.793
And I cleaned up the edges,
and these are the shapes
that caused the injury.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.219
Cam said
the blood spatter analysis...

30:07.306 --> 30:10.343
didn’t show any
drag marks on the carpet
from Dalton’s hotel room.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.766
Hmm. Which means that Cole
wasn’t killed there.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.595
No two of the injuries
share the same
impact surface area.

30:15.690 --> 30:19.649
I know. So it appears the guy
was hit with various weapons
that were each used once.

30:19.735 --> 30:24.445
Or he was hit multiple times
by a weapon with a variety
of surface shapes.

30:24.532 --> 30:27.695
Well, you know,
this could be a tailpiece.

30:27.785 --> 30:31.027
- A what?
- And— And that
could be a tremolo arm.

30:31.122 --> 30:34.785

those lines are from strings.

Solid-body guitars
can prove quite lethal.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.968
There have to be
over 50 guitars
at that fantasy camp.

30:48.055 --> 30:50.341
Without cause,
we can’t get warrants
for all of them.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.640
Yeah, but that shape.

30:52.727 --> 30:56.015
The— The bottom is too curved
to be a Tele or a Strat.

30:56.105 --> 30:58.687
It’s not an SG because
the tailpiece wraps around,

30:58.774 --> 31:01.231
and then there’s the distance
to the jack plate.

31:01.318 --> 31:04.230

31:13.497 --> 31:15.533
- How expensive?
- I’d say our victim...

31:15.624 --> 31:18.752

a quarter of a million dollars.

after a perfectly nice evening,

want to shake my hand.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.929
Yeah, well, it disappeared
at the same time that Cole did.

for his guitar?

he was killed with his guitar.

With a ’57 Gibson Les Paul.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.892

dealers in the area,

33:07.319 --> 33:09.025
Unless the killer
destroyed it.

Killing something like that
would be like killing

You know, the guitar
has long been recognized...

33:16.620 --> 33:18.702
as an unconscious symbol
of copulation.

33:18.789 --> 33:22.577
The, uh, head and the shaft are phallic,
the body feminine.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.875
Maybe our killer was acting
out of sexual confusion.

33:24.962 --> 33:26.953
Or maybe someone
just wanted the guitar.

confessed to shoving pills

After Dalton’s party,
I snuck into Cole’s room
and took the guitar.

It was sitting on the stand,
all polished.

gave a crap about it.

planning on sleeping with

34:55.344 --> 34:57.835
as part of his own
“rock—and-roll fantasy.”

34:59.014 --> 35:02.222
He thanked me for being
such lo w-hanging fruit.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.391
So you killed him
and you stole his guitar.

He didn’t deserve that guitar.

Well, everything
that you’ve learned
about the victim, uh,

35:24.164 --> 35:27.247
indicates that
he was only interested
in the external signifiers...

35:27.334 --> 35:28.790
of the rock-and-roll lifestyle,
correct?

35:28.877 --> 35:31.209
Yes. The clothes,

35:31.297 --> 35:34.255

35:53.402 --> 35:56.109
the fact that Richard Cole was
playing the ultimate guitar...

35:56.196 --> 35:58.687
would be sacrilegious,
profane even.

35:58.782 --> 36:02.570
And the fact that the killer
put it back in Cole ’s room,
rather than destroy it,

36:02.661 --> 36:04.743
further demonstrates
his reverence for rock and roll.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.695
So you’re saying
that the music is the motive?
