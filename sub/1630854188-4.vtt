WEBVTT

00:09.048 --> 00:10.214
Hey.
JAY: Hey, babe.

00:10.316 --> 00:13.013
I'm making shakshuka.
Oh, smells good.

00:13.115 --> 00:14.545
Oh, paprika?

00:14.647 --> 00:16.251
You got to warn a guy.

00:16.353 --> 00:17.752
Hey, you know that huge tree

00:17.854 --> 00:19.390
at the edge of the property,
the really old one?

00:19.492 --> 00:21.128
I heard the neighbors
are gonna cut it down.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.798
What? But that's been there
for centuries.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.331
Who cuts down a beautiful tree?

00:26.433 --> 00:28.426
When I was a girl,
I would while away afternoons

00:28.528 --> 00:30.167
in its glorious shade.

00:30.269 --> 00:31.628
I was even married
under that tree.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.332
You know what, cut it down.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.772
We could protest.

00:34.874 --> 00:36.104
In my day, we were

00:36.206 --> 00:37.140
always protesting

00:37.242 --> 00:38.435
to protect the environment.

00:38.537 --> 00:39.537
Once, I took acid

00:39.640 --> 00:41.344
to save the snow leopards.

00:41.446 --> 00:43.542
Wait, are there
still snow leopards?

00:43.644 --> 00:46.019
Yeah.
You're welcome.

00:46.122 --> 00:48.513
Thor not understand.
Is just one tree.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.250
So many more like it.

00:50.352 --> 00:51.922
There's one there.

00:52.024 --> 00:53.620
And there. And there.

00:53.723 --> 00:55.689
He's gonna point out
every tree, isn't he?

00:55.791 --> 00:57.855
Sam, you have to do something.
Please.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.761
Okay, I will go talk
to the neighbors,

00:59.863 --> 01:02.266
see if there's some way
we can save the tree.

01:02.368 --> 01:03.937
There's another
large one there.

01:04.039 --> 01:05.901
Oh, that's a telephone pole.
It same!

01:06.003 --> 01:07.035
Okay.

01:07.137 --> 01:09.374
♪ ♪

01:12.144 --> 01:13.807
TREVOR:<i> Hey, Thor.</i>

01:14.543 --> 01:16.645
You like Flower,
right?

01:16.747 --> 01:19.515
Yes, but Flower not ready
for two-person commitment.

01:19.617 --> 01:22.920
And Pete too cowardly
and selfish to be third.

01:23.022 --> 01:24.653
Oh, sorry, big guy.

01:24.755 --> 01:26.883
But that commitment stuff
is just an excuse.

01:26.985 --> 01:29.286
It means she doesn't
like you enough.

01:29.388 --> 01:30.622
Yet.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.626
She's giving you
an opening

01:32.729 --> 01:34.328
with this
environmentalism stuff.

01:34.430 --> 01:35.862
What do you mean, "opening"?

01:35.964 --> 01:37.935
Chicks like it when
you're into the stuff

01:38.037 --> 01:39.432
that they're into.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.834
Like, when I was alive,

01:40.936 --> 01:42.473
there was this nail
polish brand that had

01:42.575 --> 01:44.404
all these clever names
for different colors.

01:44.506 --> 01:46.439
Like, Make Your Mauve

01:46.541 --> 01:48.641
and Orange You Cuticle.

01:48.743 --> 01:50.975
Anyway, I memorized
all of them.

01:51.077 --> 01:53.045
And when I saw
some hottie at a bar,

01:53.147 --> 01:55.315
I would correctly guess
which one she had on,

01:55.417 --> 01:57.086
and boom, I was in.

01:57.188 --> 01:58.519
You see what I'm saying?

01:58.621 --> 02:01.258
You mean that
if Thor take interest

02:01.360 --> 02:03.557
in thing Flower into,
like trees,

02:03.659 --> 02:05.957
then Flower fall in love
with Thor?

02:06.059 --> 02:08.563
That's what I'm
talking about. Yes!

02:08.665 --> 02:11.402
Yes, Thor think
Trevor very wise man.

02:11.504 --> 02:13.600
Thank you. Can you start
telling people that?

02:13.702 --> 02:15.476
Because I say
smart things,

02:15.578 --> 02:17.975
but people can't get past the
fact that I'm not wearing pants.

02:18.077 --> 02:19.705
You are like Odin--

02:19.807 --> 02:22.379
wisest god--
if Odin's butt cheeks

02:22.481 --> 02:24.079
always visible
every time he bend over.

02:24.181 --> 02:26.187
Okay. I'm out.

02:29.222 --> 02:30.521
Hi! We're your neighbors.

02:30.623 --> 02:32.822
I'm Sam, and this is
my husband, Jay.
Hi.

02:32.924 --> 02:34.895
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm-I'm June and this is Ally.

02:34.997 --> 02:37.457
And this is our arborist Ted.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.657
Hi there.
Hello, Ted.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.460
<i> The</i> June and Ally?

02:41.562 --> 02:43.537
As in, Cover Crop Farms?

02:43.639 --> 02:45.064
That's us.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.874
They're, like, the biggest
organic farmers in the area.

02:46.976 --> 02:49.405
(stammering)
I'm geeking out.

02:49.507 --> 02:50.869
Sam, can we get
to the tree, please?

02:50.971 --> 02:52.870
Anyway. The reason
we came to talk to you

02:52.972 --> 02:55.105
is because
we really love this tree,

02:55.207 --> 02:57.614
and we were hoping
to talk you into keeping it.

02:57.716 --> 02:58.977
Yeah, we love the tree, too,
but Ted says

02:59.079 --> 03:01.118
it probably won't live
that much longer,

03:01.220 --> 03:02.914
unfortunately, so we're...

03:03.016 --> 03:04.688
we're cutting it down.
FLOWER: Boo!

03:04.790 --> 03:06.422
Although I support your
women-owned business,

03:06.524 --> 03:08.429
but boo to
the tree thing!

03:08.531 --> 03:11.189
Well, aren't there things
you could do to help the tree?

03:11.291 --> 03:13.224
Listen, we just don't want it
to damage our work shed.

03:13.326 --> 03:16.203
Tell them the tree has special
significance to the Lenape.

03:16.305 --> 03:17.898
The thing is,
this tree actually has

03:18.000 --> 03:20.337
special significance
to the native Lenape.

03:20.439 --> 03:22.935
Really?
Well, why do you think that?

03:23.037 --> 03:25.336
See those markings?
I made those, Sam.

03:25.438 --> 03:28.912
For one thing, those markings
are definitely Lenape.

03:29.014 --> 03:30.006
Really?

03:30.108 --> 03:31.345
The marks represent
the 13 dialects

03:31.447 --> 03:33.078
of the Lenape language.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.218
Uh, yes, they represent
the 13 dialects

03:35.320 --> 03:37.121
of the Lenape language.

03:37.223 --> 03:38.290
How-how do you know that?

03:38.392 --> 03:40.918
Uh, 'cause my best friend
is Lenape.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.362
Oh!
What the hell, man?

03:42.464 --> 03:44.193
So now Sass
is your best friend?
(scoffs)

03:44.295 --> 03:46.497
I mean, my good friend.

03:46.599 --> 03:50.133
I have a lot of friends
who I like equally.

03:50.235 --> 03:51.635
Okay.
Okay.

03:51.737 --> 03:54.704
The point is, this tree
is just really important.

03:54.806 --> 03:56.702
No one loves nature
and respects indigenous people

03:56.804 --> 03:58.673
more than we do.
Mm-hmm.

03:58.776 --> 04:00.104
But this tree
needs to come down.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.383
And that's not us saying it.
That's Ted.

04:02.485 --> 04:05.079
He gets paid, like, two grand
to make these calls.

04:05.181 --> 04:06.512
So...

04:06.614 --> 04:08.482
Rich and handsome.

04:08.584 --> 04:10.785
If only he were dead.

04:10.887 --> 04:13.023
THORFINN:
<i> Oh, uh, hi there, Flower.</i>

04:13.125 --> 04:14.721
Oh, hey, Thor.

04:14.823 --> 04:17.120
So, how about
the environment, huh?

04:17.223 --> 04:19.058
What about it?
Just listing things

04:19.160 --> 04:21.124
that I deeply care about,
like the environment.

04:21.227 --> 04:24.832
So you like Thor better now?
What?

04:24.934 --> 04:27.000
It's just that,
um, Thor like what you like,

04:27.102 --> 04:30.103
and oftentimes that leads
to woman being happy.

04:30.205 --> 04:32.913
Okay, well, you haven't
actually said anything

04:33.015 --> 04:34.645
about the environment.

04:34.747 --> 04:36.914
Like, what specifically
are you concerned about?

04:37.016 --> 04:38.952
Um...

04:39.055 --> 04:41.515
Thor like your nails. Yes.

04:41.617 --> 04:43.285
and, uh, recognize color.

04:43.387 --> 04:44.715
Orange You Cuticle.

04:44.817 --> 04:46.250
I think that's blood

04:46.352 --> 04:48.257
from when I tried
to fend off the bear.

04:48.359 --> 04:50.192
Yes, well, it's working.

04:50.294 --> 04:51.929
Mm.
Cool.

04:52.031 --> 04:53.123
I'm gonna...

04:53.226 --> 04:54.997
walk into another room now.
That's...

04:55.100 --> 04:57.635
(grunts)

04:59.141 --> 05:00.938
I'm so bummed about the tree.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.768
Well, isn't there anything you
can do to change their minds?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.474
In my day, if one wanted change,

05:04.576 --> 05:05.938
one would put pen to parchment.

05:06.041 --> 05:08.077
It was my letters
that inspired the public

05:08.179 --> 05:10.778
to demand a second watering
trough outside the statehouse.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.317
Hamilton wrote
51 Federalist Papers

05:13.419 --> 05:14.815
and saved the Constitution.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.614
Just to further
prove your point.

05:16.716 --> 05:17.985
Thank you, Peter.

05:18.087 --> 05:20.194
The ghosts are suggesting
that I write an op-ed

05:20.296 --> 05:22.020
to put the pressure
on June and Ally.

05:22.123 --> 05:24.555
Write your way out.
Like Hamilton.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.561
Oh, come on.

05:26.663 --> 05:28.302
Okay, I have a lot of ideas.

05:28.404 --> 05:30.129
And it's gonna be
a really great op-ed,

05:30.231 --> 05:33.234
but I'm gonna need
some time to write it.

05:33.336 --> 05:34.406
Babe...

05:34.508 --> 05:36.036
Which means somebody
has to make sure

05:36.138 --> 05:38.208
they don't cut the tree down
in the meantime.

05:38.310 --> 05:41.105
Absolutely not.

05:41.208 --> 05:44.242
Hey, guys.
I'm so sorry about this

05:44.344 --> 05:46.913
and I hope it doesn't affect
our friendship. Oh!

05:47.016 --> 05:48.783
I can see your sunchokes
from up here.

05:48.886 --> 05:52.789
They look great,
so congrats on those.

05:58.698 --> 06:00.094
So, how'd it go?
Great. I pitched the op-ed

06:00.196 --> 06:01.799
to<i> The Ulster County Review</i>
and they loved it.

06:01.901 --> 06:04.103
They're publishing it
on their website tonight.

06:04.205 --> 06:05.401
Babe, that's amazing.

06:05.503 --> 06:07.172
Thanks.
Champagne.

06:07.274 --> 06:08.307
Oh, I don't need any.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.100
I do.
I was in a tree all day.

06:10.202 --> 06:12.369
SASAPPIS:
<i>The Ulster County Review.</i>

06:12.471 --> 06:14.678
So did you see anybody else
while you were there?

06:14.780 --> 06:18.217
Any 500-year-old
female Lenape ghosts, perhaps?

06:18.319 --> 06:20.986
Hmm. Could you be more specific?

06:21.088 --> 06:22.154
Sam, just tell me.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.853
Yes, I did see Shiki.

06:25.361 --> 06:28.693
Oh, hey.
So funny running into you.

06:28.795 --> 06:30.727
Really? I've been here
hundreds of years.

06:30.829 --> 06:32.728
Had to think
there was a decent chance.

06:32.831 --> 06:34.796
No, I mean because
I'm actually writing

06:34.899 --> 06:37.403
an op-ed that
would interest you.

06:37.505 --> 06:40.232
Just working on a pitch.
So nervous.

06:42.672 --> 06:44.805
She says hi.
Oh. Nice.

06:44.907 --> 06:47.446
I mean, that's cool,
uh, no big deal.

06:47.549 --> 06:49.045
You know? Either way
would have been fine.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.548
And I'm cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

06:51.650 --> 06:53.643
Get a hold
of yourself, man.

06:53.745 --> 06:54.983
Sorry.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.853
Oh, dear, two men hunched

06:58.955 --> 07:01.090
over Samantha's
lap computer.

07:01.192 --> 07:03.659
I know better than to look
at what's on that screen.

07:03.761 --> 07:06.197
Relax, it's a bunch
of nature stuff.

07:06.299 --> 07:07.567
Picture of a baby seal.

07:07.669 --> 07:10.535
I don't care what you're
into, you deviants.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.866
No, Trevor help Thor
look up stuff

07:11.968 --> 07:13.802
about environment
to impress Flower.

07:13.904 --> 07:16.107
We have cut forests,
dirty seabirds,

07:16.209 --> 07:17.676
a river on fire.

07:17.778 --> 07:20.005
(chuckles)
That one actually pretty cool.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.213
It says here
the ocean heating up

07:21.315 --> 07:22.477
is threatening marine life.

07:22.579 --> 07:24.580
Cod lives in ocean.

07:24.682 --> 07:27.550
And also herring lives in ocean.

07:27.652 --> 07:30.415
And salmon. And haddock and...

07:30.517 --> 07:32.888
Now he's gonna name
all the fishes, isn't he?

07:32.990 --> 07:34.685
They are in danger
due to hot oceans.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.195
Very bad!

07:36.297 --> 07:37.530
(scoffs)
I'm confused.

07:37.632 --> 07:38.961
Now you actually care
about the environment?

07:39.063 --> 07:42.026
What began as mission
to win one woman's heart

07:42.128 --> 07:45.268
has morphed into mission to save

07:45.370 --> 07:48.542
the planet!

07:51.643 --> 07:54.838
Now, if I wanted to look up...

07:54.940 --> 07:57.148
"stable boys..."

07:57.250 --> 07:59.047
is that in there?

08:02.615 --> 08:04.621
Uh, Sam, why is Jay just
hanging out in the kitchen?

08:04.723 --> 08:06.617
Yeah, who's watching
the tree?

08:06.719 --> 08:09.362
Oh, don't worry, I have Isaac
over there acting as lookout.

08:09.464 --> 08:11.125
If anybody comes
to do anything...

08:11.227 --> 08:13.364
He'll scream silently
and invisibly at them.

08:13.466 --> 08:14.396
He will come and tell us.

08:14.498 --> 08:16.400
Babe, good news!

08:16.502 --> 08:17.698
Your article is trending.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.600
Well, I mean,
locally.

08:19.702 --> 08:21.068
In between "missing cow"

08:21.170 --> 08:22.740
and "weatherman
with a secret family."

08:22.842 --> 08:24.942
Nice!
Well, not for the cow's owner

08:25.044 --> 08:27.746
or the weatherman's wife,
but sure, enjoy your moment.

08:27.848 --> 08:30.179
I don't understand.
What does this mean, "trending"?

08:30.282 --> 08:33.152
It means we're turning the
pressure up on June and Ally.

08:33.254 --> 08:34.777
Now everybody will know

08:34.880 --> 08:37.154
that they're trying to destroy
a piece of Lenape history.

08:37.256 --> 08:38.248
Cool.

08:38.350 --> 08:39.989
Move him, please.
Jay, move.

08:40.091 --> 08:43.126
I have news from the front.
The op-ed worked.

08:43.228 --> 08:45.498
Sam has rallied the public
who now march in protest.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.662
Jay, people are protesting
at the tree.

08:47.764 --> 08:48.963
We got to go check it out.

08:49.066 --> 08:51.235
Wow. This is becoming
a big deal, huh?

08:51.337 --> 08:52.806
Hell yeah, it is.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.739
The power of the pen--
it's mightier than the sword.

08:54.841 --> 08:56.275
Not if it's
a plus-two magic sword.

08:56.378 --> 08:57.806
Those are pretty powerful.

08:57.908 --> 09:00.037
What?
It's a D and D thing.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.110
You don't deserve Jay.

09:06.649 --> 09:08.016
Everything okay?

09:08.118 --> 09:10.253
I would have expected you
to be a little more

09:10.355 --> 09:11.920
excited, no?

09:12.023 --> 09:13.593
Yeah. I mean, it's
good, you know?

09:13.695 --> 09:15.757
Save the Lenape tree.
ALBERTA: Sass?

09:15.859 --> 09:18.228
What's going on?
All right.

09:18.330 --> 09:19.661
Um...

09:19.763 --> 09:21.833
I may have exaggerated

09:21.935 --> 09:24.470
the tree being significant
to the Lenape.

09:24.572 --> 09:25.803
I mean, it's significant to me,

09:25.905 --> 09:27.339
and I'm Lenape,
so in that sense...

09:27.441 --> 09:29.874
You lied?
Yep, uh-huh.

09:29.976 --> 09:32.110
So what is the significance
of the tree?

09:32.212 --> 09:33.877
Um...

09:33.979 --> 09:36.039
you promise you won't
make fun of me?

09:36.141 --> 09:37.711
You have our word.

09:37.813 --> 09:39.719
It's my Shiki tree.

09:39.821 --> 09:42.422
So, when I was alive,
I would make a mark

09:42.524 --> 09:45.559
every time we had an encounter.

09:45.661 --> 09:48.357
"Encounter,"
like, times you did it?

09:48.459 --> 09:49.930
No...

09:50.032 --> 09:50.888
Made out?

09:50.990 --> 09:52.297
Not exactly.

09:52.399 --> 09:54.826
Uh, it's the times

09:54.928 --> 09:56.597
that she...

09:56.699 --> 09:58.797
said hi to me.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.107
Oy gevalt.

10:00.209 --> 10:02.032
Hey.
Hey.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.834
Hi.
Hey.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.878
Hi!

10:08.613 --> 10:09.980
I think it's sweet.

10:10.082 --> 10:12.283
I mean, sad and pathetic,
but also so sweet.

10:12.385 --> 10:13.587
This is sick.

10:13.689 --> 10:15.546
"Hi's"?
You don't mark down "hi's."

10:15.648 --> 10:16.787
And this is why
I didn't want to share it.

10:16.889 --> 10:18.383
You got to tell Sam
the truth, Sass.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.725
Do I?
So some protesters showed up.

10:20.827 --> 10:22.657
So what?
Maybe they'll save a tree.

10:22.759 --> 10:23.859
Isn't that a good thing?

10:23.961 --> 10:25.931
That's true.
Well, maybe, I guess.

10:26.033 --> 10:29.425
So was "hi" like a more
sexual thing back then?

10:29.527 --> 10:31.237
And I'm done.
TREVOR: Buddy, no!

10:31.339 --> 10:32.503
What am I missing?

10:32.606 --> 10:34.799
I want to be on your side!

10:35.802 --> 10:38.810
MAN: And once you got all
that dirt up to the surface...

10:38.912 --> 10:41.204
How long you watch TV?
(both shushing)

10:41.306 --> 10:43.040
Uses much electricity.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.015
Bad for environment.

10:46.144 --> 10:47.749
(screaming)

10:47.852 --> 10:49.519
Hey!
We were watching that!

10:49.621 --> 10:51.282
Dude! Not cool.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.660
What not cool is
wasting energy.

10:53.762 --> 10:55.696
Really, Thor?
This is getting tiresome.

10:55.798 --> 10:57.928
You are becoming the party guest
who overindulges

10:58.030 --> 10:59.997
in cocaine
and traps one in the corner,

11:00.099 --> 11:02.163
going on and on
about Gilbert and Sullivan.

11:02.265 --> 11:04.398
That was you.
I was there, as ghost.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.569
Well, then allow me
to be your cautionary tale.

11:06.671 --> 11:08.908
Dude, you need to relax.

11:09.010 --> 11:11.703
Relax? Sort of like
how you relax on private jet,

11:11.805 --> 11:14.412
spewing toxins into the air
on way to spring break?

11:14.514 --> 11:15.882
That was legendary.

11:15.984 --> 11:18.780
We went to a foam party
on South Padre Island.

11:18.882 --> 11:21.721
And, you, worst of all.

11:21.823 --> 11:24.315
Industrial Revolution
start of everything.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.450
Thor read about
dark seductress,

11:26.552 --> 11:28.293
buried deep
within the Earth.

11:28.395 --> 11:30.459
Her name is...

11:30.561 --> 11:33.525
coal.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.660
We did get really into coal.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.738
Both of you lived selfish lives,
endangered Earth.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.730
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

11:40.832 --> 11:42.867
Dude, I hear you.
But have you seen a stewardess

11:42.969 --> 11:46.510
on a private jet? We're talking
1 Oak bottle service level.

11:46.612 --> 11:48.247
And not Wednesdays.

11:48.349 --> 11:50.447
Weekend 1 Oak.

11:50.549 --> 11:51.751
(grumbles)

11:51.853 --> 11:52.847
(chanting):
Protect Lenape culture!

11:52.949 --> 11:55.278
Protect Lenape culture!

11:55.380 --> 11:57.623
Protect Lenape culture!

11:57.725 --> 11:59.555
It's so good
to be protesting again.

11:59.657 --> 12:01.256
Flower, boundary.

12:03.165 --> 12:04.221
Whoa.

12:04.323 --> 12:05.561
Look at all these people.

12:05.663 --> 12:07.299
Hey, uh, guys.

12:07.401 --> 12:08.733
Hi. (chuckles)

12:08.835 --> 12:10.834
I know this is a
bit much, but we all

12:10.936 --> 12:12.930
just really care
about the tree.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.169
We can tell.

12:14.271 --> 12:15.740
PROTESTOR:
Support Sam, she's a hero!

12:15.842 --> 12:18.407
Oh, come on, I don't
know about hero.

12:18.509 --> 12:20.644
(chuckles) I mean, I was the one
who climbed up in the tree.

12:20.747 --> 12:22.749
Don't see a lot of Jay signs.

12:22.851 --> 12:24.715
(chanting continuing)
Hi.
Hi.

12:24.817 --> 12:26.577
My name is Bob.
I'm with

12:26.679 --> 12:28.451
the Hudson Valley
Lenape Cultural Center.

12:28.553 --> 12:29.589
Oh, hi.

12:29.691 --> 12:30.653
You're the author of the op-ed?

12:30.755 --> 12:32.150
I am. And honestly,

12:32.252 --> 12:33.592
I was happy to do it.

12:33.694 --> 12:34.926
Well, the thing is, I'm afraid

12:35.028 --> 12:36.219
you might not have
all your facts straight.

12:36.321 --> 12:37.721
(gasps)
Really?

12:37.823 --> 12:39.823
BOB:
Well, as you note
in your article, you said

12:39.925 --> 12:43.402
these markings represent
the 13 dialects of the Lenape.

12:43.504 --> 12:44.794
That's correct.

12:44.896 --> 12:47.401
The Lenape language
only has two modern dialects.

12:47.503 --> 12:50.134
It's possible that we might've
had more in the past,

12:50.236 --> 12:51.304
but nowhere near 13.

12:51.406 --> 12:52.802
I hate to quibble
with you, Bob,

12:52.904 --> 12:54.779
but I do have it on
pretty good authority

12:54.881 --> 12:57.010
that there were
13 dialects.

12:57.113 --> 12:58.813
Right. And I'm telling you

12:58.915 --> 13:00.014
that's not the case.

13:00.116 --> 13:01.382
Sass, you got
to get in there.

13:01.484 --> 13:03.088
She's about to back down.
It'll be fine.

13:03.190 --> 13:04.790
It's cool that he knows
this stuff though, isn't it?

13:04.892 --> 13:07.155
Look, I appreciate
that you come

13:07.257 --> 13:09.159
from a place
of experience, but...

13:09.261 --> 13:11.193
Uh, sorry, just to,
uh, just to clarify,

13:11.295 --> 13:13.697
uh, so you're telling,
uh, Bob here,

13:13.799 --> 13:15.360
who, uh-- just checking--

13:15.462 --> 13:16.832
is Lenape?
That's right.

13:16.934 --> 13:18.233
You're telling
that guy,

13:18.335 --> 13:19.967
that he doesn't know
what he's talking about?

13:20.070 --> 13:21.807
Well... (chuckles) I'm...

13:21.909 --> 13:23.300
Hey, just a heads up,
this is starting

13:23.402 --> 13:25.511
to look a little Karen-y.

13:25.614 --> 13:27.705
Sass!
Okay, fine.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.411
I know the optics
on this aren't great,

13:29.513 --> 13:32.485
and I don't have an explanation
for how I know this,

13:32.587 --> 13:33.987
but you have
to trust me.

13:34.089 --> 13:36.417
So I made up all the stuff
about the 13 dialects.

13:37.893 --> 13:40.855
When I say I want
to humbly apologize.

13:40.957 --> 13:43.864
(protesters booing)

13:45.097 --> 13:46.832
(chanting):
Down with Woodstone!

13:46.934 --> 13:50.000
Down with Karen!
Down with Woodstone!

13:50.103 --> 13:52.067
(phone ringing)
Down with Karen...

13:52.169 --> 13:53.705
Woodstone B and B,
are you canceling

13:53.807 --> 13:55.565
for the reason
I think you are?

13:55.667 --> 13:57.874
Totally get it.
Have a great day.

13:57.976 --> 14:00.012
Down with Karen!
Down with...

14:05.778 --> 14:08.312
Silver bird in sky,
killer of cod,

14:08.414 --> 14:11.287
I curse thee to Niflheim!

14:11.389 --> 14:13.651
Hey, Thor, could I talk
to you for a second?

14:13.753 --> 14:16.857
(laughs) Yeah, just
yelling at silver bird.

14:16.959 --> 14:18.127
Cool, cool.

14:18.230 --> 14:20.396
So, listen,
I think it is so great

14:20.498 --> 14:22.293
that you want to turn people
on to the environment,

14:22.395 --> 14:24.561
but you can't just make

14:24.663 --> 14:26.832
everyone feel bad
about themselves.

14:26.935 --> 14:27.936
Why not?

14:28.038 --> 14:29.538
Well, when we protested

14:29.640 --> 14:32.270
the war in Vietnam, we didn't
just yell at people all day.

14:32.373 --> 14:34.013
We went to music festivals

14:34.115 --> 14:36.243
and did lots of drugs.
You see what I mean?

14:36.345 --> 14:38.915
Thor not good at drugs.
When alive,

14:39.017 --> 14:41.381
drink tea
of stinking henbane

14:41.483 --> 14:42.889
and instead of having
rapturous visions,

14:42.991 --> 14:46.021
Thor just get worried
no one like Thor.

14:46.123 --> 14:47.718
I'm saying we had a movement,

14:47.820 --> 14:50.055
which people
wanted to be a part of.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.964
You can't just...

14:52.066 --> 14:54.560
yell at people,
you have to inspire them.

14:54.662 --> 14:57.794
Yes. Like when executing Danes
in countryside,

14:57.896 --> 15:00.836
leave one alive
to tell tales of brutality.

15:00.938 --> 15:02.101
You mean like that?

15:02.203 --> 15:03.868
Okay, I'm gonna say yes,

15:03.970 --> 15:06.012
'cause I don't want
to hear any more examples,

15:06.114 --> 15:08.206
but I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.407
Okay.
Okay.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.380
Figuring it out.
All right.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.886
So the protestors
are finally gone,

15:13.989 --> 15:16.352
but not before I had
to profusely apologize

15:16.454 --> 15:18.815
for being brazenly ignorant
about Lenape culture.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.850
What the hell, Sasappis?
Why did you lie to me?

15:20.952 --> 15:23.530
I'm sorry, Sam, but
it wasn't all a lie.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.331
The tree is important.

15:25.433 --> 15:28.197
It was there when I was alive,
and I did make those marks.

15:28.300 --> 15:29.702
Okay,
so what do they really mean?

15:29.804 --> 15:32.364
They represent the 13 times

15:32.466 --> 15:35.199
that Shiki said "hi" to me.

15:35.301 --> 15:36.576
What's going on?

15:36.678 --> 15:38.434
The markings were every time

15:38.536 --> 15:40.676
Shiki said "hi" to Sass.

15:40.778 --> 15:42.810
Really?

15:42.912 --> 15:45.046
Just "hi"?

15:45.149 --> 15:46.244
Okay, I'm not proud of it.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.747
Why didn't you tell me?

15:47.849 --> 15:49.218
I thought if you knew
what they actually meant,

15:49.321 --> 15:50.550
you wouldn't think
they were important,

15:50.652 --> 15:52.685
and you wouldn't help me
protect the tree.

15:52.787 --> 15:54.361
It is my unfortunate
duty to inform you...

15:54.463 --> 15:55.653
Tree dead!

15:55.756 --> 15:58.322
Yes, I was trying
to be more delicate,

15:58.424 --> 16:00.460
but, yes, tree dead.

16:00.562 --> 16:03.463
(sighs)
Wow, it's really gone.

16:03.566 --> 16:05.568
So were "hi's" more
significant back then?

16:05.671 --> 16:06.730
Shh.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.866
Thor been here
a thousand years.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.202
Many things that were
once here, plentiful,

16:11.304 --> 16:12.672
now gone.

16:12.774 --> 16:15.406
Not blaming Sam even
though she use blow dryer

16:15.508 --> 16:18.018
entire hour every day.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.849
You're right, Thor.

16:20.951 --> 16:22.449
It's all gone.

16:22.552 --> 16:24.553
You know, I don't think
it was just about

16:24.655 --> 16:27.252
the markings that I made
on that tree. It's that...

16:27.354 --> 16:29.519
everything's gone.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.489
My people were pushed out.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.629
I watched all of it happen.

16:33.732 --> 16:37.098
And that tree was the last thing
left from when I was alive.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.568
And now it's gone, too.

16:45.146 --> 16:47.447
I wish there was something
we could do.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.274
Need to inspire.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.411
What's that?

16:51.513 --> 16:54.010
Thor think
Thor have idea.

16:55.285 --> 16:56.689
It's just hard to have much hope

16:56.792 --> 16:58.916
when it's presented like that.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.322
So, what is this?

17:03.424 --> 17:05.257
What do y'all want to do?

17:05.359 --> 17:07.330
Sass, oldest friend.

17:07.432 --> 17:09.728
We can't bring back
what you've lost.

17:09.830 --> 17:12.666
But from the past
is born the future.

17:13.468 --> 17:14.774
These are seeds from the tree.

17:14.876 --> 17:16.576
June and Ally gave them to us.

17:16.678 --> 17:18.636
So, from your tree

17:18.738 --> 17:20.703
will blossom
many new trees.

17:20.805 --> 17:22.773
And your tree of friendship

17:22.876 --> 17:25.111
with Shiki will
now be whole area

17:25.213 --> 17:26.944
of friendship.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.420
Sort of a friend zone
is what you're saying?

17:30.522 --> 17:32.184
Yes, friend zone.
(car approaches, stops)

17:32.286 --> 17:33.216
Well put.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.689
Oh, God.

17:34.791 --> 17:35.928
No better place to be.
(car doors open, close)

17:36.030 --> 17:38.356
Samantha, a man
approaches.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.900
Oh, hey, it's Bob.

17:41.002 --> 17:43.396
Hey, Bob.
We invited Bob over

17:43.498 --> 17:44.764
to do a land acknowledgement.

17:44.866 --> 17:46.038
It's a way
that we can honor the Lenape,

17:46.141 --> 17:47.597
who lived right here
on this land.

17:47.700 --> 17:48.932
It's just
a small gesture

17:49.034 --> 17:51.702
so that we can keep
their presence alive here.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.570
Who are you guys
explaining this to?

17:54.672 --> 17:57.041
Oh, uh, each other.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.578
Yep.
We like to explain
things to each other.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.050
(laughs)
God love these dummies.

18:02.152 --> 18:03.618
Okay, well, uh,

18:03.720 --> 18:05.681
I kind of have a lunch thing
I got to get to.

18:05.783 --> 18:07.459
Right, sorry. Go ahead.

18:07.562 --> 18:10.526
That's the thing, a-a land
acknowledgment isn't something

18:10.628 --> 18:12.328
for me to do.
It's something for you to do.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.963
I already know
about our history.

18:15.065 --> 18:16.432
Bob rocks.

18:16.534 --> 18:18.633
It's up to you,
who now want to live

18:18.735 --> 18:21.666
and work on this land,
to honor and acknowledge

18:21.768 --> 18:23.701
that sometimes difficult
history.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.239
Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense.

18:26.341 --> 18:28.577
I'll give it a shot.

18:30.010 --> 18:32.612
As we build our lives
and our business here,

18:32.715 --> 18:35.021
we want to acknowledge
that this is

18:35.123 --> 18:37.014
the ancestral land
of the Lenape.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.186
They have taken care
of this land for generations,

18:39.288 --> 18:41.221
and it is an honor to

18:41.323 --> 18:43.590
continue that tradition.

18:43.692 --> 18:46.595
(speaks Lenape)
Thank you, Sam.

18:47.495 --> 18:48.695
If you'd like, I could do

18:48.797 --> 18:50.461
a traditional welcome,
in-in Lenape.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.930
Yeah, we'd love that.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.934
(speaking Lenape)

19:02.846 --> 19:05.046
BOTH:
We are glad
because you people come

19:05.148 --> 19:06.578
to Lenapehoking.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.984
Live well while you are here.

19:09.086 --> 19:10.250
Thank you.

19:10.352 --> 19:12.016
That was beautiful, Bob.

19:13.492 --> 19:15.655
It's been a pleasure, yeah.
Thank you.

19:15.758 --> 19:17.755
We will watch
these trees grow...

19:17.857 --> 19:20.195
together,
my oldest friend.

19:20.298 --> 19:22.460
Yep, we're not going anywhere.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.394
(grunts)
Thanks, bud.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.429
Yeah.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.165
Friend zone!

19:27.267 --> 19:29.834
ALL (chanting):
Friend zone! Friend zone!
Stop!

19:29.937 --> 19:32.208
Friend zone! Friend zone!
Stop! Okay!

19:32.310 --> 19:33.840
Friend zone...
Okay...

19:39.819 --> 19:41.118
Thor.

19:41.220 --> 19:42.419
I thought it was really cool,

19:42.521 --> 19:44.113
what you did
with Sass' Friend Zone.

19:44.215 --> 19:46.081
(groans)
That name's sticking, isn't it?

19:46.184 --> 19:47.789
You did something
for the environment,

19:47.891 --> 19:51.224
but you also did it
in a way that inspired people.

19:51.326 --> 19:52.963
I'm impressed.

19:53.065 --> 19:54.366
It was nothing.

19:54.468 --> 19:56.292
Me, too, Thor,
especially because it won't even

19:56.394 --> 19:58.835
affect you. It's Jay
and my kids and their kids

19:58.937 --> 20:01.804
that are gonna have to deal with
all this climate change stuff.

20:01.906 --> 20:04.609
Wait, are you pregnant?
Did Jay's seed find purchase?

20:04.712 --> 20:07.103
Am I about to be a great-great-
great-great-great-aunt?

20:07.205 --> 20:09.476
No. I just meant
because Thor's a ghost,

20:09.578 --> 20:11.207
so his life isn't gonna change

20:11.309 --> 20:13.409
because of drought
or rising sea levels.

20:13.511 --> 20:15.718
In a way, I'd almost think
you'd want climate change

20:15.820 --> 20:18.421
to happen faster. The sooner
the Livings kill themselves,

20:18.523 --> 20:20.860
the sooner the Earth
goes back to normal.

20:20.962 --> 20:23.492
Wait, this is so true.

20:23.595 --> 20:25.932
This is not
Thor's problem at all.

20:26.034 --> 20:27.763
Samantha, Thor change mind.

20:27.865 --> 20:30.466
Climate change great thing.
Keep up good work.

20:30.568 --> 20:32.466
Get the Livings
to die faster

20:32.568 --> 20:34.136
to usher in glorious new era!

20:34.238 --> 20:35.598
Oh, no, no.
Yes!

20:35.700 --> 20:37.242
(laughing)

20:37.344 --> 20:39.078
He's blowing it, isn't he?
Yeah.

20:39.180 --> 20:40.979
But I probably
won't remember it,

20:41.081 --> 20:42.513
so he's still got a chance.
