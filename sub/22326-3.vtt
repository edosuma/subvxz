We're coming up on Yavin 4.

00:09.001 --> 00:10.734
I wonder what this
rebel cell is like,

00:10.769 --> 00:12.314
and how big it is
compared to Phoenix group.

00:12.338 --> 00:15.330
According to Hera, it's more
well-equipped than we were.

are now a part of this cell.

What, you haven't gotten
weak since I've been gone,

00:50.242 --> 00:52.342
have you, big guy? Where's Hera?

00:52.377 --> 00:54.411
She's on a supply mission.

00:54.446 --> 00:55.646
Come on, I'll show you around.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.883
So many different

00:59.919 --> 01:01.877
There are cells gathered here

01:01.912 --> 01:04.279
from every corner of the galaxy.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.398
And it's still not enough
against the Empire.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.549
As long as we can help
Ryder and Lothal,

01:08.585 --> 01:10.037
I'll take what I can get.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.178
I'm fine, Wedge.

I'm glad you all made it
down in one piece.

02:37.374 --> 02:39.408
Sorry about the mission.
If we just could've...

02:39.443 --> 02:41.843
This wasn't your fault.

yourselves so courageously,

They'll be fine.

Right now, my family here
needs me more.

03:09.614 --> 03:12.073
Well, I'm glad to have you.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.109
And there's plenty enough
work to go around.

03:14.144 --> 03:15.852
Well then, let's get started.

03:15.888 --> 03:19.589
A reunion. How nice.

03:19.624 --> 03:20.902
But as Commander Bridger
suggests,

03:20.926 --> 03:23.051
it's time to get to work.

03:23.086 --> 03:24.444
Mon Mothma requests
your presence.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.119
Captain, I commend your bravery

03:33.155 --> 03:35.047
in protecting
your fellow pilots.

I just want to know what
went wrong out there.

As do I.

03:40.395 --> 03:43.296
Senator Organa may be able to
shed some light on that for us.

03:43.331 --> 03:45.699
My sources in the Senate
confirm that the Empire

03:45.734 --> 03:47.353
has established
a new communications relay

03:47.377 --> 03:49.353
in the Jalindi system.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.664
It greatly expands their
command and control

03:50.688 --> 03:53.932
throughout the surrounding
sectors, and enabled them

03:53.967 --> 03:56.592
to respond much more
quickly to your incursion.

03:56.628 --> 03:58.264
(SIGHS) I hate to admit it,
but it appears

03:58.288 --> 04:00.180
Gerrera's rumors were true.

04:00.215 --> 04:02.565
Hmm, how does Saw's ragtag group

04:02.601 --> 04:04.651
have better intel than we do?

04:04.686 --> 04:08.605
Because Gerrera has
absolutely no qualms

04:08.640 --> 04:10.923
about how he acquires it.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.284
Well, if he gets results...

04:13.320 --> 04:16.288
We do not mistreat
our prisoners.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.692
Now, the question is,

04:20.727 --> 04:22.386
what course of action
do we take?

04:22.421 --> 04:26.731
We can't allow this relay
to hamper our missions.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.426
Perhaps there is another way.

04:31.429 --> 04:34.889
If we could somehow
tap into this relay,

04:34.924 --> 04:37.684
we could use it to monitor
Imperial fleet movements

04:37.719 --> 04:40.387
and adjust our own
operations to avoid them.

04:40.422 --> 04:41.571
Can it be done?

04:41.606 --> 04:45.158
My crew and I have done
plenty of jobs just like it.

they're still waiting.

amassed our forces,
