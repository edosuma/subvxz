That's not a good idea.

She's not like us.

Tell me, Rumple,

04:03.244 --> 04:05.986
was he really worth all that trouble?

04:07.456 --> 04:09.162
Every bit of it.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.287
He was family.

You mean you can't control it.

04:58.841 --> 05:01.048
Well, maybe if
you could let me learn how to...

what you really are.

say that to your own daughter?

Because you're not my daughter!

There. I said it.

After all these years,
now that your mother's gone,

She was lulled by your beauty.

there was something else.

05:42.051 --> 05:44.087
What do you think
drove me to drink, child?

05:46.722 --> 05:48.758
Now wipe away those tears,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.431
you put on a good face,

05:53.437 --> 05:55.598
and make me breakfast.

to grieve Baelfire's death

Let me guess, rum?

06:36.313 --> 06:37.814
Never hurts.

I'd find the person
responsible for his father's death.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.367
It's really all I can do for him right now.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.786
That can't be true.
Have you tried talking to the boy?

06:54.873 --> 06:56.249
As far as he's concerned,

06:56.333 --> 06:58.449
I haven't seen Neal
since he left me in jail.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.910
So anything I tell him
about his dad being a hero

sounds like I'm making it up
just to get him to feel better.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.505
Perhaps I could talk to him.

07:05.593 --> 07:08.460
About what?
Leather conditioner and eyeliner?

07:10.472 --> 07:12.633
I knew Bae as a boy.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.882

07:14.977 --> 07:17.935
what his father was like
when he was his age.

You'd really do that?

07:20.733 --> 07:21.813
Aye.

make peace with his father's passing.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.948
the most powerful
in all the realms.

14:30.287 --> 14:34.280
Like you,
Regina has the gift of magic.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.286
But she has been
unable to develop it.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.168
ZELENA: Magic is a gift.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.628
WIZARD: Yes.

14:41.715 --> 14:45.048
And he's trying to teach her that.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.676
He should be teaching me.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.306
Not her.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.130
I need to meet this wizard.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.476
I'll pay whatever you desire.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.518
Just please, (SIGHS)
tell me how to get there.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.351
Look down.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.814
When you click
your heels together three times,

15:08.950 --> 15:12.863
those slippers will take you
wherever you desire.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.497
Well, what do you want in return?

15:14.623 --> 15:18.957
I simply ask that you bring me
something of Rumplestiltskin's.

15:19.044 --> 15:23.162
Be careful, it is one thing
to wonder about your past,

15:23.298 --> 15:27.007
but another to become envious of
things you cannot have.

15:33.683 --> 15:34.763
(HEELS CLICKING)

15:34.851 --> 15:36.182
(WHOOSHING)

16:01.294 --> 16:03.000
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

16:14.099 --> 16:16.260
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
Well, this is a day of surprises.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.557
I thought that would take you
at least until...

16:20.897 --> 16:22.273
You're not Regina.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.980
No.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.228
I'm Cora's other daughter.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.698
That's not possible.

16:30.782 --> 16:34.240
I'm Zelena. Her firstborn.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.784
We'll see about that.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.583
(BOTTLE TOP POPS)

16:51.219 --> 16:53.084
Well, hello, dearie.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.800
A day of surprises indeed.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.178
(SIGHS) Regina, is she telling the truth?

17:03.273 --> 17:06.060
I don't know.
I haven't found anything yet.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.641
Are you sure
that Cora didn't booby-trap her stuff?

17:07.777 --> 17:08.812
I mean, I don't think
that a sleeping curse

17:08.945 --> 17:10.060
would be good for the baby.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.863
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

17:13.950 --> 17:16.202
David, Belle, and Tink
are locking down Main Street

17:16.286 --> 17:18.777
just in case this fight actually happens.

17:19.331 --> 17:21.538
MARY: Regina?
Did you find something?

17:21.625 --> 17:23.286
Uh, a letter.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.078
What's it say?

17:28.131 --> 17:30.247
Zelena is my sister.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.012
Regina, what does...

17:35.138 --> 17:36.753
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

17:37.515 --> 17:38.971
(CHEST CLOSES)

17:39.100 --> 17:41.933
It's my fight. I've got it handled.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.972
What the hell was in that letter?

17:53.156 --> 17:55.363
If we position someone
there, there, and there,

17:55.492 --> 17:56.607
we'll have the whole street covered.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.202
I'll talk to Blue,
see if we can get reinforcements.

17:58.328 --> 18:00.364
No. You heard Zelena,
she said no interference.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.203
She'll probably order Gold
to level half the block

18:02.332 --> 18:04.163
if we try something
before she has a crack at her sister.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.532
So they really are sisters?

18:05.669 --> 18:07.034
She found a letter in her vault
confirming it.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.285
Where is she? Regina.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.245
She disappeared.
Something in the letter upset her.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.455
Should we try to find her?

18:11.549 --> 18:13.631
Regina was pretty clear
she didn't want any help on this one.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.094
You're going to let her
walk into this fight alone?

18:17.055 --> 18:19.046
(STAMMERS)
But you just said we can't interfere.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.217
Because Zelena has Gold on her side.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.806
We need to remove him
from the equation.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.554
It's the only way
Regina has a fighting chance.

18:23.687 --> 18:24.972
We just need to get his dagger.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.019
You saw Zelena.
She practically has it glued to her hand.

18:27.524 --> 18:28.604
Wait, wait...

18:28.692 --> 18:32.025
What if... What if I can get through
to Rumple without the dagger?

18:32.153 --> 18:34.860
It's worth a try.
Regina can't do this alone.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.409
(SIGHS)

18:41.621 --> 18:42.997
(GASPS)

18:43.081 --> 18:45.072
We have to stop meeting like this.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.996
Did the Charmings
send you to give me a pep talk?

18:49.087 --> 18:51.043
Because I don't do well with pep talks.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.003
ROBIN HOOD: No, nothing of the sort.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.882
After Zelena's threat,

18:56.011 --> 18:57.501
I decided to patrol the woods,

18:57.595 --> 19:01.588
in case she decided
to build the ranks of her simian army.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.892
How are you holding up?

19:06.021 --> 19:08.057
I'm not a flying monkey,
if that's what you mean.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.228
(CHUCKLES)

19:09.566 --> 19:10.772
So, are you going to tell me
what's in that letter

19:10.900 --> 19:12.640
you've been staring at?

19:12.736 --> 19:14.772
What letter?

19:14.904 --> 19:16.644
This one.

19:16.740 --> 19:17.820
I'm a pickpocket by trade.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.943
I spent many years
learning how to rob from magicians.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.613
You're lucky
I'm saving my strength for that witch.

19:23.580 --> 19:24.660
I think, deep down,

19:24.748 --> 19:26.579
you actually want to
talk about what's in here.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.448
What makes you think
you know me so well?

19:28.585 --> 19:31.793
Well, for one thing, I'd be charred
to a crisp by now if you didn't.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.921
-True.
-(CHUCKLES)

19:35.925 --> 19:37.756
So, can I read it?

19:38.470 --> 19:40.210
I'm not stopping you.

19:43.266 --> 19:47.680
"Cora, dear,
I finally got my hands on your firstborn.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.228
"Never thought I'd find her, did you?

19:50.315 --> 19:52.055
"Now I know why.

19:52.150 --> 19:55.358
"She's the most powerful sorceress
I've ever encountered.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.777
"Even more powerful than you.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.231
"Stunning in every way."

20:03.495 --> 20:05.577
Rather complimentary, I'd say.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.790
Why is this troubling you?

20:11.002 --> 20:14.244
I've seen that letter
a hundred times before.

20:15.131 --> 20:19.295
In my darkest moments,
I'd go to it for comfort.

20:20.303 --> 20:24.421
For solace.
For a boost when I needed it.

20:24.516 --> 20:25.972
Because I...

20:29.687 --> 20:32.975
Because I always thought
it was about me.

20:35.527 --> 20:36.767
(SIGHS)

20:37.320 --> 20:38.901
It's about Zelena.

20:38.988 --> 20:42.606
Rumplestiltskin thinks
she's more powerful than I am.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.407
Why care what that imp thinks?

20:45.495 --> 20:49.864
Because if the man who taught me
everything I know about magic

20:49.999 --> 20:53.162
thinks she is stronger than I am...

20:55.964 --> 20:58.956
Then there's no way I can win this fight.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.923
Cora never mentioned me?

21:04.013 --> 21:05.344
A firstborn daughter.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.680
I think that's something
I would have remembered.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.175
Now, there's a spell, a curse,

21:10.311 --> 21:12.472
I've been working on
for a very, very long time.

21:12.564 --> 21:15.180
Now, I foresaw that...
That that curse

21:15.316 --> 21:18.149
could only be cast by Cora's daughter.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.856
That's why
you've been training Regina.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.854
You thought she was
going to cast the curse.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.197
Until today.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.322
Shall we see what you can do?

21:29.873 --> 21:32.159
Magic isn't about what you see, dearie.

21:33.585 --> 21:36.702
It's about what you feel inside.

21:41.759 --> 21:45.672
You'll have to dig deep
if you want to pass tonight's test.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.304
What am I meant to do?

21:48.391 --> 21:51.053
Simple, find me.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.348
Over here, dearie.

21:54.439 --> 21:57.055
Close. But not close enough.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.316
Magic comes from emotion.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.520
Simply think of a moment
that makes you seethe with anger...

22:03.615 --> 22:04.900
...and use it to fuel that magic.

22:05.033 --> 22:08.321
Yes, I learnt that a long time ago.

22:08.411 --> 22:11.118
Well, it's... It's hard to pick one.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.330
Finding out
that my mother abandoned me.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.578
That my father never wanted me.

22:16.711 --> 22:17.746
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: Getting warmer.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.621
That my sister
got everything that I ever desired.

22:20.757 --> 22:23.499
That she didn't even have to try.
That it was all just handed to her.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.083
That she doesn't even know
what she has!

22:27.096 --> 22:29.473
-Ding-dong.
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)

22:29.724 --> 22:31.260
There it is.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.135
I can feel it in your nails.

22:35.271 --> 22:38.604
I'm sorry. I lost control.

22:38.733 --> 22:40.098
And now you need to think
of a moment of happiness

22:40.235 --> 22:41.816
to reign in some of that anger.

22:43.154 --> 22:44.690
What do you think about?

22:44.781 --> 22:46.988
I'm the teacher. I ask the questions.

22:47.116 --> 22:50.608
Yeah. But if you don't tell me,
then how will I learn?

22:54.791 --> 22:58.249
Well, like you,
I was abandoned as a child.

23:00.463 --> 23:04.456
Some spinsters took us in.
We didn't have much, but we got by.

23:05.426 --> 23:09.339
Whenever we'd finish a job,
they used to bake meat pies.

23:10.181 --> 23:14.140
The entire hovel
would fill with the most wonderful smell.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.102
And after they'd cooled,

23:19.190 --> 23:22.478
they always used to
let me take the first bite.

23:23.027 --> 23:25.484
And as the food warmed my belly,

23:26.447 --> 23:30.531
that was the only time
I forgot who I really was,

23:32.620 --> 23:35.327
a boy who wasn't wanted by his papa.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.537
Then I know my moment.

23:44.716 --> 23:48.584
The moment I stopped feeling
like someone who wasn't wanted.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.045
The moment you agreed to train me.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.216
(SIGHS)

23:54.517 --> 23:55.632

23:59.022 --> 24:00.853
EMMA: We're clear.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.100
There's no sign of Zelena.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.352
It looks like
she's still keeping Gold in the cellar.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.355
Rumple?

24:12.201 --> 24:13.611
Belle?

24:14.621 --> 24:16.486
I've come to free you.

24:16.581 --> 24:18.242
No, leave. Leave! You have no idea

24:18.374 --> 24:20.751
what that witch will make me do to you
if she catches us.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.084
(CHUCKLING) I'm not afraid.
You could never hurt me.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.206
No, it's futile.

24:24.297 --> 24:28.040
As long as she holds the dagger,
I cannot leave.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.749
I'm not leaving without you.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.217
It's not worth the risk.

24:32.221 --> 24:33.256
Just try.

24:40.521 --> 24:41.772
(GRUNTS)

24:42.899 --> 24:45.561
You just have to believe in us.

24:57.747 --> 24:59.738
-Run.
-What?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.368
Run! Go!

25:01.459 --> 25:03.165

25:04.003 --> 25:05.163
Well, don't mind me.

25:05.254 --> 25:08.587
Carry on, I was just enjoying the show.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.008
(WHOOSHES)

25:13.012 --> 25:14.343
-EMMA: Belle?
-Over here!

25:14.430 --> 25:17.547
(SOBBING) It was a trick.
She was toying with us.

25:17.642 --> 25:18.973
Zelena sends a message.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.719
She will face Regina
without interference.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.429
The next time you try to stop her,

25:26.025 --> 25:27.811
|Wi|| kill you.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.488
I think I've tied every knot in here.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.528
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

25:41.040 --> 25:43.076
When do we get to
the part about my dad?

25:43.167 --> 25:45.283
Just a few moments longer.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.127
There. Come here.

25:52.552 --> 25:53.541
What's this?

25:53.636 --> 25:57.800
That, my boy, is a sextant.
It's a tool used by sailors to navigate.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.676
Like a GPS?

26:01.644 --> 26:02.850
Aye.

26:02.979 --> 26:05.391
It measures our position using the stars.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.272
Not sure that's what a GPS does,

26:08.359 --> 26:10.350
but what does it
have to do with my dad?

26:10.486 --> 26:13.478
Well, I taught him to navigate with one.
Just like I'm going to teach you.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.692
Were you both
in the Navy or something?

26:15.825 --> 26:17.156
No.Baem

26:18.536 --> 26:21.073
Neal was just a boy when I taught him.

26:21.164 --> 26:24.031
Wait. Aren't you the same age?

26:26.169 --> 26:29.081
It seems like the more
you guys tell me about my dad,

26:29.172 --> 26:31.037
the less things make sense.

26:31.174 --> 26:32.835
I don't want to learn how to navigate.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.758
Ijust want to hear something about him
that doesn't make him sound

26:35.845 --> 26:37.631
like he's made-up so I'll like the guy.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.337
Your mother isn't
keeping things from you

26:39.432 --> 26:40.717
because she doesn't want you
to know the truth.

26:40.808 --> 26:43.675
I know, she's doing it to protect me.

26:43.770 --> 26:47.137
But how am I supposed to
feel anything about him being gone

26:47.231 --> 26:50.348
if I don't know
what he was like while he was here?

26:52.737 --> 26:54.523
Fair enough, mate.

26:56.783 --> 27:00.822
What I haven't told you
is why I taught your father to sail.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.576
It's because he had just lost his father.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.499
I thought the sea
would help ease his sorrow.

27:08.586 --> 27:12.078
Wait, he lost his dad, too?

27:12.173 --> 27:13.379
Aye.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.047

To change the past?

39:54.685 --> 39:56.471
(LAUGHING)

39:59.648 --> 40:00.933
What's so funny?

40:01.024 --> 40:02.980
I'm afraid that's impossible.

40:03.110 --> 40:05.817
I thought you were
the Great and Terrible Oz.

40:05.946 --> 40:08.813
Even my power has its limits.

40:11.493 --> 40:12.653
(CURTAIN RIPS)

40:14.663 --> 40:15.823
You're telling me.

40:17.374 --> 40:18.409
(GRUNTS)

40:18.500 --> 40:20.286
Oh! No! Don't hurt me! Please.

40:20.377 --> 40:21.412
Who are you?

40:22.004 --> 40:23.164
(GRUNTS)

40:23.380 --> 40:27.373
My... My name is Walsh.
I'm... I'm just a circus huckster.

40:27.509 --> 40:29.045
I'm a showman.

40:29.177 --> 40:31.884
I come from a distant land,
a place called Kansas.

40:32.014 --> 40:33.129
You're not even a wizard?

40:33.223 --> 40:36.681
It's all part of the act.
But what I peddle is real.

40:36.810 --> 40:38.971
What you saw there is real.

40:39.062 --> 40:41.678
Those slippers took you to
the enchanted forest, didn't they?

40:43.066 --> 40:44.852
I may not have magic,

40:45.360 --> 40:47.396
but the things I collect do.

40:47.529 --> 40:50.191
That's why you wanted me to bring you
something of Rumplestiltskin's.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.905
So you could carry on this charade?

40:53.035 --> 40:55.526
I didn't mean any harm.
I was trying to help us both.

40:56.163 --> 41:00.202
What you seek doesn't exist.
No magic is that strong.

41:02.044 --> 41:03.534
Well, then...

41:04.713 --> 41:06.669
I have no use for you.

41:06.757 --> 41:09.248
At least not like that.

41:11.887 --> 41:13.002
Like what?

41:14.056 --> 41:18.299
What I need is someone who is willing
to do whatever I ask without question.

41:18.393 --> 41:19.724
(CHUCKLES)

41:23.440 --> 41:25.897
Like a trained circus animal.

41:28.445 --> 41:29.560
You are evil.

41:30.739 --> 41:32.400
Not evil, dear.

41:33.784 --> 41:34.944
Wicked.

41:35.619 --> 41:36.654
No.

41:36.745 --> 41:38.076
No!

41:39.539 --> 41:40.915
(CHITTERING)

41:40.999 --> 41:42.079
(LAUGHS)

41:42.918 --> 41:44.408
Much better.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.667
Now come.

41:46.755 --> 41:50.293
If I'm going to find a way
to change the past,

41:50.425 --> 41:52.211
I've got work to do.

41:56.556 --> 41:57.887
(WHOOSHES)

41:58.725 --> 42:00.966
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
Well done, Regina.

42:01.103 --> 42:02.468
You've been practicing.

42:03.271 --> 42:07.731
You're shaping up to be
the best pupil I ever had.

42:11.113 --> 42:12.978
We'll see about that.

42:14.157 --> 42:16.113
When I'm done, Regina,

42:17.327 --> 42:20.114
you'll have never even been born.
