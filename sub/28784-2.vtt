00:04.170 --> 00:06.180
[Baby Chip crying]

00:13.660 --> 00:15.490
-Morning.
-Morning, Big Chip.

00:15.530 --> 00:17.270
Hey, Chip? No, no, no, no--
can I please take a shower?

00:17.320 --> 00:18.710
If I don't take a shower,
I'm gonna die.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.710
-Will you hold Little Chip?
-I was--

00:20.750 --> 00:22.710
-I need to go to the rodeo.
-JODE: Honey, you need
to change his diaper.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.540
I was up five times
last night, Jode.

00:24.580 --> 00:27.070
-You do it. It's just piss.
-I have to get to Arby's,

00:27.110 --> 00:28.680
The cloth diapers
take forever to change.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.200
They're slow to change,
fast to biodegrade, Jode.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.070
Is that a good thing?

00:32.110 --> 00:34.730
JODE:
Baby's crying keep you up
last night, Chip?

00:34.770 --> 00:37.640
-Uh... No, I didn't...
-We're trying to let him
cry it out, you know?

00:37.680 --> 00:40.910
-It's like a method.
-Yeah. It's, um...

00:40.950 --> 00:43.080
It's noisy, yeah, but, uh...

00:43.130 --> 00:45.080
-Yeah.
-...it's cute.

00:45.130 --> 00:47.090
Yeah, man, ain't he cute?

00:47.130 --> 00:49.350
Can you believe we made
that little Chip baby?

00:49.390 --> 00:50.960
Yeah, God, yeah.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.570
Greatest thing that's ever
happened to me, man.

00:53.610 --> 00:55.350
-Rent's due.
-Huh?

00:55.400 --> 00:56.750
Rent is due.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.750
Yeah, um...

00:58.790 --> 01:00.530
Actually, my wallet's
right here.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.750
It's okay, baby.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.099
[shushing]
It's okay.

01:04.150 --> 01:06.150
Yeah, that should work.

01:06.190 --> 01:08.980
Oh, man, I'm gonna
take Claire to dinner.

01:09.020 --> 01:10.760
Can you babysit?

01:10.800 --> 01:12.940
-When?
-Hey, we're going
to dinner tonight!

01:12.980 --> 01:15.240
-Tonight?
-Is that cool, man?You need to bond with the baby.

01:15.290 --> 01:17.200
Oh.
[shushing]

01:17.250 --> 01:20.380
-Yeah, I guess so. I...
-Oh, man, thank you so much.

01:20.420 --> 01:22.990
That's... That's awesome, man.

01:23.030 --> 01:26.040
Hey, it's all right.
Hey, it's Uncle Chip.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.210
All right, see you.
Thanks, buddy.

01:28.260 --> 01:29.610
-[farts]
-TRINITY: Oh, Chip, hey.

01:29.650 --> 01:31.130
-Yeah.
-He's pooping.

01:31.170 --> 01:33.610
Can you just take the diaper andscrape all the shit out of it

01:33.650 --> 01:35.130
and put it
in the dirty diaper bucket?

01:35.180 --> 01:38.180
Thank you so much,
I'll be out in an hour.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.840
[both crying]

01:51.110 --> 01:52.720
CHIP [sighing]:
Aw, I shouldn't do this,

01:52.760 --> 01:54.150
but I'm just gonna get
some disposable diapers

01:54.200 --> 01:55.590
for Baby Chip.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.160
Um, I think they're over here.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.240
-Okay, okay.
-Baby Chip, huh?

01:59.290 --> 02:02.160
I wish somebody would name
a baby after me.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.160
Well, it's not
that easy, Martha.

02:04.210 --> 02:06.210
Baby Chip cries a lot.

02:06.250 --> 02:09.210
-Most babies do, I've heard.
-[whispering]: Hey.

02:09.250 --> 02:12.300
How do you know
when a baby is possessed?

02:12.340 --> 02:16.170
I think it's like if he has
a really deep voice

02:16.220 --> 02:20.050
-or projectile-vomits.
-Yeah?

02:20.090 --> 02:22.050
Or his head spins
all the way around.

02:22.090 --> 02:24.840
But that last one might be fake.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.180
[regular volume]:
Thank you for the information.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.620
-Thank you so much.
-Chip, it sounds like

02:28.670 --> 02:31.890
your living situation
is pretty untenable.

02:31.930 --> 02:34.190
I'm gonna find an apartment
for you, okay?

02:34.240 --> 02:38.020
It took me 73 tries to findmine. It can be really daunting.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.630
Martha, look,

02:39.680 --> 02:42.200
I live with Baby Chip now,
Jode and Trinity.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.420
That's just who I live with--
they're my family.

02:44.460 --> 02:45.810
I need stool softeners.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.470
[sighs]
Okay. Then, Chip,

02:47.510 --> 02:49.690
do you want to know what
my new life coach would say?

02:49.730 --> 02:51.430
You have a life coach?

02:51.470 --> 02:53.650
-Yeah.
-But don't you need
a life first?

02:53.690 --> 02:55.650
-[sighs]
-Hey, those are free samples.

02:55.690 --> 02:57.220
Look at that.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.650
Is this, uh,
chili safe for babies?

02:59.700 --> 03:03.310
I need somebody to check
all the light bulbs.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.880
In the bathrooms,
in the waiting rooms,

03:05.920 --> 03:08.230
throughout the whole rodeo,please, if somebody can do that.

03:08.270 --> 03:09.660
And then, if you could order

03:09.710 --> 03:11.660
urinal cakes,
that would be helpful.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.230
-Amazon is out of urinal cakes.-How is Amazon
out of urinal cakes?

03:14.280 --> 03:16.370
Double-check, please. Okay?

03:16.410 --> 03:20.240
That's a hell of a name to callsomething like that, a cake.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.330
CHIP:
And then, the-the bleachers,especially the northwest corner

03:22.370 --> 03:24.680
-of the, uh...
-DANIEL: Sorry, excuse me.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.240
Hate to interrupt. Oh, hey,
Eddie, how are you doing?

03:26.290 --> 03:29.250
-Oh. Sober. [chuckles]
-Hi.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.250
-Sober?
-Yeah.

03:30.290 --> 03:32.820
Oh, good to-- good.
Good. Hi-hi. Hi.

03:32.860 --> 03:36.390
-Hey.
-Uh, Daniel Kwon,
um... I'm your, uh,

03:36.430 --> 03:38.340
from the church next door,
I'm a friend of your mother's.

03:38.390 --> 03:40.300
[yawning]:
My mother's told me
about you, yeah.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.260
I know who you are-- sorry.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.130
Yeah-- I... Excuse me.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.480
DANIEL:
So, listen, can you,
can you do me a favor?

03:46.530 --> 03:48.180
Could you ask your mother
if we can rent

03:48.220 --> 03:49.750
your parking lot during
our church service?

03:49.790 --> 03:51.400
Our attendance
is going through the roof.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.750
Absolutely, we can, uh--
you know what?

03:54.790 --> 03:56.970
We don't need to call her.

03:57.010 --> 03:59.060
What kind of money
are we talking about?

03:59.100 --> 04:00.320
Uh, we got about $300?

04:00.370 --> 04:03.980
-Can you do it for $400?
-Uh... $325?

04:04.020 --> 04:06.200
-How about $320?
-Perfect. Okay, great.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.070
Thanks. Great to meet you guys.Thank you.

04:08.110 --> 04:10.550
All right, thank you.
I'll talk to you later.

04:10.590 --> 04:12.290
Wait a second.

04:14.990 --> 04:18.300
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have one new message.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.300
MRS. BASKETS:
Hey, Chip, it's your mother.

04:20.339 --> 04:23.520
-I'm here with Ken and Susan.
-[Susan meowing]

04:23.560 --> 04:26.520
Susan says hi.
[laughs]

04:26.570 --> 04:28.740
Daniel says he met with you,

04:28.790 --> 04:31.000
and you're quite
the little negotiator.

04:31.050 --> 04:33.010
Thanks for bringing
in the business, Chip.

04:33.050 --> 04:35.010
KEN:
We're so proud of you, son!

04:35.050 --> 04:37.320
-KEN: I can call him
that now, can't I?
-Yes.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.580
-KEN: I thought I could.
-Well, you did, so...

04:40.620 --> 04:42.580
Hi, little boy.

04:42.630 --> 04:45.450
Hi, little boy. Come to Mama.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.460
-Aw...
-Good boy.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.550
-Is there a disposable?
-That's cool. All good.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.330
Thanks, Big Chip.

04:50.370 --> 04:52.200
That's a good boy.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.030
MRS. BASKETS:  Anyway, keep up the good work,

04:54.070 --> 04:56.030
honey, and good night.

04:56.070 --> 04:59.340
Does it hang up on its own,
or do I have to click off?

05:03.250 --> 05:06.000
[sighs]

05:06.040 --> 05:08.040
[snoring softly]

05:11.830 --> 05:14.130
-[Trinity screaming]
-[gasping]

05:14.180 --> 05:16.180
[Baby Chip crying]

05:16.220 --> 05:18.360
-Is everything okay?
-It's fine. It's okay.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.930
It's just that Baby, um...
Baby Chip threw up everywhere

05:21.970 --> 05:24.190
in the middle of the night
and he almost choked to death.

05:24.230 --> 05:25.410
But it's okay, he didn't.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.800
[crying]:
He didn't, did you?

05:26.840 --> 05:28.450
-JODE: Baby... [gags]
-Okay, here, take the baby.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.450
Change his jammies.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.460
JODE:
The baby just freaked out

05:30.500 --> 05:32.020
and spewed everywhere.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.500
-TRINITY:
Go get us some new sheets.
-[Jode coughing]

05:33.550 --> 05:36.240
Okay?

05:36.290 --> 05:37.380
Wait, where they at?

05:37.420 --> 05:40.940
God, Jody...!

05:40.990 --> 05:43.470
-Give me my baby.
-[phone ringing]

05:43.510 --> 05:45.860
-Give him to me.
-Let me get that phone.

05:45.910 --> 05:48.520
-[retching, coughing]
-Pick it up.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.390
[panting]:
There. Oh, it's okay.

05:50.430 --> 05:53.090
Hello? Dr. Rubinstein?

05:53.130 --> 05:55.050
Hey, man. Yeah, yeah.

05:55.090 --> 05:58.050
[retching]

05:58.090 --> 05:59.400
Thanks, man.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.970
-What did he say?
-He wants me to go
get Pedialyte.

06:03.010 --> 06:05.620
I got to go to
the 24-hour pharmacy on 15th.

06:05.660 --> 06:08.280
-[coughing]
-[crying]: No, don't leave me!

06:08.320 --> 06:10.100
-It's okay, baby.
-Don't leave me, baby!

06:10.150 --> 06:11.320
-It's gonna be okay. All right?-Baby...

06:11.370 --> 06:13.240
Okay, I-I-I-I-I'll go.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.410
-I can go. Yeah, I'll go.
-[coughing, crying]

06:15.460 --> 06:17.460
[Muzak playing quietly]

06:38.390 --> 06:40.400
[Baby Chip crying]

06:50.620 --> 06:52.620
[crying softens]

06:59.110 --> 07:01.110
[insects chirping]

07:14.520 --> 07:15.600
Chip, your mom
keeps calling.

07:15.650 --> 07:18.480
[phone ringing, buzzing]

07:18.520 --> 07:20.740
Huh? Yeah?

07:20.780 --> 07:23.130
-MRS. BASKETS:
Chip? Daniel Kwon called me.
-Huh?

07:23.180 --> 07:26.570
-He says no one was at the  rodeo to open the parking lot.-What? Oh, di...

07:26.620 --> 07:29.310
-He's been waiting there
an hour.
-Huh?

07:29.360 --> 07:33.620
Chip? Did the people at that  apartment give you some drugs?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.580
-Yeah.
-[horns honking]

07:40.980 --> 07:42.150
[gate creaking]

07:42.200 --> 07:44.550
It's open! Come on!

07:54.600 --> 07:55.950
He's new at this, Christine.

07:55.990 --> 07:58.170
I'm sure it was
just a one-time thing.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.000
The rodeo's too much
responsibility for him.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.520
He's really just
a front-of-the-house guy.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.650
Just go easy on him.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.310
I love you, Ken,

08:06.350 --> 08:09.570
but I don't agree
with your management style.

08:09.610 --> 08:11.790
[horn honking]

08:11.830 --> 08:15.360
-What up, what up?
-Hey.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.970
Sorry I'm late.

08:17.010 --> 08:19.620
Are you, you living
with a baby now?

08:19.670 --> 08:21.630
JODE:
This is uh, Baby Chip,
Mrs. Baskets.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.020
We named him after Big Chip,
the hero.

08:23.060 --> 08:25.150
He saved Baby Chip last night,

08:25.200 --> 08:26.410
-so...
-Wow.

08:26.460 --> 08:27.680
...we brought...

08:27.720 --> 08:29.680
-Arby's. Free.
-Free Arby's.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.770
Curly fries, uh,
and two Big Kahunas.

08:32.809 --> 08:34.679
-This one kind of opened up.
-Oh.

08:34.730 --> 08:37.210
-Here you go.
-MRS. BASKETS: Well,
that's very nice of you.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.210
You take that, honey.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.780
I need to talk to the big Chip.

08:41.820 --> 08:44.430
-JODE: All right, cool. Peace.
-[tires screeching]

08:44.480 --> 08:46.650
-MRS. BASKETS: Jesus.
-What do you want?
Wh-Where are we going?

08:46.700 --> 08:49.790
Is he a maniac or what?
There's a baby in there.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.400
KEN:
So, Chip, what's your plan?

08:52.440 --> 08:55.010
Uh... I don't know, I was
gonna go back to the apartment

08:55.050 --> 08:57.230
and take a nap
and then maybe have a siesta.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.580
And then, after that,
take a break.

08:58.620 --> 09:01.710
No. What's the plan
for your life, Chip?

09:01.750 --> 09:04.800
What's your one-year plan?
What's your five-year plan?

09:04.840 --> 09:06.850
Every man should have
a plan for his future.

09:06.890 --> 09:08.630
Yeah. Uh...

09:08.670 --> 09:10.810
When you're our age,
are you still gonna be living

09:10.850 --> 09:12.630
with these circus geeks
and their kid?

09:12.680 --> 09:15.720
Well, I really haven't thought
of it, but, God, I hope not.

09:15.770 --> 09:18.470
You need to find
a serious place to live.

09:18.510 --> 09:21.730
Until you do, please come home.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.600
-Chris...
-What? We've got so much room.

09:24.650 --> 09:27.170
You'll hardly know he's there.

09:27.210 --> 09:29.650
-Chip.
-[snoring]

09:29.690 --> 09:32.040
-KEN: Chip?
-Yes.

09:32.090 --> 09:35.440
You're sleeping
while I'm talking to you.

09:35.480 --> 09:39.050
I just want you to know
you're welcome to come home.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.270
Um...

09:41.310 --> 09:43.270
Well, Martha's looking
for apartments, Mom,

09:43.320 --> 09:44.620
I apprec--
I-I do appreciate that,

09:44.670 --> 09:46.890
and I-I just don't want
to disappoint her.

09:46.930 --> 09:48.630
KEN:
Yeah, I think Chip's got
a handle on this, Christine.

09:48.670 --> 09:52.630
Why don't we just enjoy
the food? It's free.

09:52.670 --> 09:56.420
Have you seen any of the placesthat Martha has picked out?

09:56.460 --> 09:59.070
-That would be a negative. No.
-Chip, you've got
to look at the places

09:59.120 --> 10:01.120
in order to pick one.

10:03.510 --> 10:06.250
-Look at this.
-[laughter]

10:06.300 --> 10:08.690
KEN:
That's a good one.

10:08.730 --> 10:12.870
It's good, uh, economy. Single.

10:12.910 --> 10:16.260
Yeah. Well, at least
this one has a window.

10:16.310 --> 10:18.570
MRS. BROOKS:
Ooh. It smells funny in here.

10:18.610 --> 10:21.530
Um, that's just 'cause your
other senses are heightened.

10:21.570 --> 10:23.100
CHIP:
How much is this place?

10:23.140 --> 10:24.710
-$900.
-[stammers]
No, no, let me handle it.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.930
Allen, I've been working
with a life coach.

10:27.970 --> 10:29.540
-Uh-huh.
-...and I'm sorry,

10:29.580 --> 10:31.670
but I'm gonna have to be
really assertive with you.

10:31.710 --> 10:33.580
-We are not...
-Oh, my God...

10:33.630 --> 10:36.150
ALLEN:
Uh, good window.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.680
Good, good view.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.380
-Maybe we'll keep looking.
-Uh...

10:45.810 --> 10:47.600
[sighs]
I'm so tired.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.950
I don't know if this is the besttime for me to be doing this.

10:49.990 --> 10:53.340
I-I mean, all this... searching.

10:53.390 --> 10:56.170
MARTHA:
Well, why don't you just move
back in with your mom?

10:56.220 --> 10:58.780
-Save money.
-What am I saving money for?

10:58.830 --> 11:00.830
-Cashmere socks.
-What?

11:00.870 --> 11:03.700
-Mom, you're awake.
-I have to go pee-pee.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.830
-Oh.
-What's this place?

11:04.880 --> 11:06.970
-Where?
-I don't know, it looks cool.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.920
-MARTHA: Where? -W-- this place. That building. Pull over.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.320
-MARTHA: Okay.
-Put your turn signal on.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.840
-[signal clicking]
-[tires screech]

11:12.880 --> 11:15.760
-Oh, God.
-Oh-- sorry, guys.
-What was that?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.800
I'm sorry.
Are you all right, Mom?

11:17.850 --> 11:19.150
Yeah, I think I'll survive.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.590
Hey, look at this. Open house.

11:20.630 --> 11:21.720
MARTHA:
Oh, Bullet Towers?

11:21.760 --> 11:23.200
This place is new.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.290
Hey, Mom,
do you mind if we go in?

11:25.330 --> 11:28.770
-They probably have
a bathroom you can use.
-Oh, thank God.

11:28.810 --> 11:30.160
NARRATOR:
Bullet Towers,

11:30.210 --> 11:32.730
the future of Bakersfield.

11:32.770 --> 11:35.390
A sophisticated
standard of living.

11:35.430 --> 11:37.390
Luxurious amenities,

11:37.430 --> 11:39.300
marble counters
in every kitchen,

11:39.350 --> 11:42.830
walking distance from
Bakersfield's finest shops,

11:42.870 --> 11:45.960
and only a few steps from California's bullet train.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.960
Zoom to the metropolis
of your choice,

11:48.010 --> 11:51.400
all while enjoying the calm
sanctuary of Bakersfield.

11:51.440 --> 11:55.270
Come taste the future
at Bullet Towers.

11:56.580 --> 11:59.410
This is our standard
studio unit,

11:59.450 --> 12:00.760
and I'm actually
in one of these--

12:00.800 --> 12:02.240
it's exceptional.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.240
Um, everything is brand-new.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.420
-Central AC, gas range...
-Yeah. It's nice.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.200
Uh, yeah.Access to common area roof deck.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.860
Um, counter-counters
that are marble

12:12.900 --> 12:14.250
if you choose the right ones,

12:14.290 --> 12:15.900
but they didn't in this one.

12:15.950 --> 12:18.780
Um, so, and then,
and then this unit

12:18.820 --> 12:21.690
has central courtyard views
and washer-dryer.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.220
-Oh, look at this.
-ANITA: It's a really,

12:24.260 --> 12:26.650
really great community
that we're building here.

12:26.700 --> 12:27.870
CHIP:
Nice view.

12:27.920 --> 12:28.830
ANITA:
Do you two have kids?

12:28.870 --> 12:30.880
Who?

12:30.920 --> 12:33.490
-ANITA: Or...-No, that's, that's just Martha

12:33.530 --> 12:34.790
and that's her visually
impaired mother.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.920
She's probably looking
for the restroom right now.

12:35.970 --> 12:37.660
-Oh.
-Whoopsie.

12:37.710 --> 12:39.360
So you'd be getting in
on the ground floor

12:39.410 --> 12:40.930
of a really great investment,

12:40.970 --> 12:43.240
especially in seven
to nine years from now,

12:43.280 --> 12:45.240
-when the bullet train's
completed.
-CHIP: Right.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.590
-Yeah.
-Uh, yes, thank you,
we have eyes.

12:47.630 --> 12:48.940
Let's get down to brass tacks:

12:48.980 --> 12:51.590
what is the monthly rent
on this place?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.420
Oh, I'm s-sorry,
I think that there's been

12:53.460 --> 12:54.860
a little bit
of a misunderstanding

12:54.900 --> 12:57.420
'cause this is a condo,
so you wouldn't be renting,

12:57.470 --> 12:59.030
you'd be buying.

12:59.080 --> 13:02.910
Oh. So I'd be a...
I'd be a homeowner.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.260
MARTHA:
Well, that's out
of his price range.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.650
This was obviously a huge wasteof time. Mom, Chip.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.870
-Martha.
-Let's go.

13:09.910 --> 13:14.610
Okay. It's a nice place.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.270
Yeah.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.660
Those are free, right?

13:17.700 --> 13:19.490
-Mm, yup.
-Thanks.

13:19.530 --> 13:22.970
-Okay. So, you interested in...?-In the waters.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.890
-Okay.
-Let's go!

13:24.930 --> 13:29.850
I like that place, but all thisis a waste of time, Martha,

13:29.890 --> 13:32.330
all of it.

13:32.370 --> 13:35.510
Here, Chiparoo, can't open it.

13:35.550 --> 13:37.330
-Mm.
-Oh.

13:37.380 --> 13:38.990
-We can keep looking.
-[sighs]

13:39.030 --> 13:40.950
I mean, why am I moving anyway?

13:40.990 --> 13:42.730
I can just get
noise-canceling headphones

13:42.770 --> 13:44.470
or earmuffs or whatever.

13:44.510 --> 13:47.300
You know, my life coach
could really help you.

13:47.340 --> 13:49.560
Life-- Do you really have
a life coach?

13:49.610 --> 13:52.000
I thought that was a joke. Isthat why you're acting so weird?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.000
-I can't get this open.
-What?

13:54.050 --> 13:56.000
What time is it?

13:56.050 --> 13:58.960
Fudge. I have to be
at class in five minutes.

13:59.010 --> 14:01.920
Do you mind if we do that firston the way to your place?

14:01.970 --> 14:05.100
Yes, I actually do mind 'cause
Baby Chip is expecting me.

14:05.140 --> 14:07.020
Here, I can't get this open.

14:07.060 --> 14:09.930
Well, it's too late,
we're almost there.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.020
-[sighing]: Oh, God.
-It'll be good for you.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.760
[sighs]

14:13.800 --> 14:15.850
♪

14:21.550 --> 14:22.900
Just doesn't seem like
you to leave your mom

14:22.940 --> 14:23.900
sitting in a car, that's all.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.990
Well, I cracked the window.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.470
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna
get out of here.

14:28.510 --> 14:29.690
This is not my scene.

14:29.730 --> 14:30.910
I'm just gonna get some food.

14:30.950 --> 14:32.560
Okay, well, can you at least

14:32.610 --> 14:34.390
grab some meatballs for my mom?

14:34.430 --> 14:35.960
-Okay.
-Martha.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.780
-Oh. Hey.
-Hi, dear.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.700
I'm so glad you came.

Hello, newcomer,
what's your name?

14:42.830 --> 14:45.620
Oh, no, Martha...
Martha dragged me here.

14:45.660 --> 14:47.930
My name's Chip,
I'm not, I'm not staying.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.840
I'm-I'm just gonna get
some meatballs,

14:49.880 --> 14:52.710
-then go to sleep in the car.
-Oh, that's okay, Chip.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.800
Um, this is my life coach Tammy.Stay.

14:55.850 --> 14:59.070
Well, hello, Chip, welcome.

14:59.110 --> 15:03.720
I ask nothing of you
except honesty, discretion,

15:03.770 --> 15:07.160
an open mind,
and, of course, no phones.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.080
Everybody, give a hand to Chip,

15:10.120 --> 15:11.600
who's here for
the first time tonight!

15:11.640 --> 15:13.820
No, I'm not...
I'm not here to...

15:13.860 --> 15:15.430
TAMMY:
Okay, Jonah, I hear you,

15:15.470 --> 15:18.830
but I need you to be
a lot more specific.

15:18.870 --> 15:20.830
JONAH:
I've been fired from
all food court places,

15:20.870 --> 15:22.870
except for Salad Euphoria.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.440
-Okay, I've had enough.
-TAMMY: Mm-hmm.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.960
JONAH:
So I started
cutting myself again.

15:26.010 --> 15:28.010
Thank you for inviting me,
or forcing me to come here.

15:28.050 --> 15:28.970
-Chip...
-Of course you did.

15:29.010 --> 15:31.060
-Please don't go.
-It makes sense.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.100
-You were out of control.
When we cut...
-Sorry.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.410
-...it's because we want
to get some control.
-Apologies.

15:35.450 --> 15:38.630
You're letting others
take control over you.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.540
Who's controlling you?

15:40.590 --> 15:44.070
Is it your bullying,
hateful brother?

15:44.110 --> 15:47.640
Is it a powerless father?
Is it a controlling mother?

15:47.680 --> 15:48.860
Who's in control?

15:48.900 --> 15:51.470
You! Are in charge.

15:51.510 --> 15:54.430
I want to hear you say it.
I am in F-ing charge.

15:54.470 --> 15:56.080
TAMMY AND JONAH:
I am in F-ing charge.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.650
Everybody here say it because
it's true for all of you.

15:58.690 --> 16:01.000
ALL:
I am in F-ing charge.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.090
[phone buzzing, chiming]

16:03.130 --> 16:04.650
Chip, someone texting you?

16:04.700 --> 16:07.270
-You can sit.
-CHIP: Uh...

16:07.310 --> 16:09.090
No, I was just, uh...

16:09.140 --> 16:12.050
It's okay. Do you want to take
a moment and answer the text?

16:12.100 --> 16:14.100
No, it's just, uh...

16:14.140 --> 16:16.450
Can I see your phone? I'd like
to see who you're texting.

16:16.490 --> 16:19.450
[laughing]:
Give it to me. I'm...

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
I'm not so scary
as you think I am.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.670
I really am not,
right, everybody?

16:23.720 --> 16:27.500
Aw, what a cutie.

16:27.550 --> 16:28.630
Is he yours?

16:28.680 --> 16:31.770
He's my roommate.
I mean, I live with him.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.080
Come here, Chip.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.470
Mm-hmm.
Well, put your phone away.

16:38.510 --> 16:42.130
You're about to do something
very important for yourself.

16:42.170 --> 16:44.650
Everyone here

16:44.690 --> 16:48.090
is trying their goddamn best

16:48.130 --> 16:50.130
to find a way
to get what they want.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.050
Right, everybody?

16:52.090 --> 16:54.750
What do you want, Chip?

16:54.790 --> 16:57.190
What do you want?

16:57.230 --> 17:00.750
Uh, I don't know.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.970
I care about you, Chip.

17:04.020 --> 17:07.670
More than I want anything,
I want you to get it.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.109
You deserve it.

17:09.150 --> 17:12.160
What do you want?

17:17.810 --> 17:20.119
I want to move out of the placeI'm living in.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.079
I work all day,
then I go home at night

17:22.119 --> 17:23.560
to help out with the baby,

17:23.599 --> 17:27.220
and the baby cries all the time,and I'm exhausted.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.700
What's stopping you?

17:30.740 --> 17:33.790
I can't find an apartment.

17:33.830 --> 17:35.220
MARTHA:
I found him three apartments.

17:35.270 --> 17:37.090
-CHIP [groans]: Ugh...-But he didn't like any of 'em.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.750
-Except the, the condo, but...
-[groans]: Ugh...

17:40.790 --> 17:42.530
...he can't afford to buy it.

17:42.580 --> 17:44.190
See what else
I've been dealing with here?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.930
You know, Martha, he's got
to do this for himself.

17:45.970 --> 17:47.760
Can't afford?
What does that mean?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.760
-It means I don't have the moneyfor an apartment.
-No, no. [chuckling]: No.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.240
What does it really mean?

17:53.280 --> 17:56.240
Let's look at this another way.

17:56.290 --> 17:58.160
You are Chip.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.900
Chip who?

17:59.940 --> 18:02.160
-[whispering]: Baskets.
-I know my last name, Martha.

18:02.210 --> 18:03.690
Ba-Baskets.

18:03.730 --> 18:05.990
-Chip Baskets?
-Yeah.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.690
[chuckling]:
Wow.

18:07.730 --> 18:12.260
Chip Baskets. Your mother
liked a lot of Mexican food.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.910
[laughter]

18:14.960 --> 18:16.920
What do you do for a living,
Chip Baskets?

18:16.960 --> 18:19.790
I'm a rodeo clown.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.010
My mom owns and runs a rodeo,

18:22.050 --> 18:25.970
and I-I clown there
during the rodeo season.

18:26.010 --> 18:27.280
He also does birthday parties.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.280
Martha, no.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.150
-Quiet.
-You clown

18:30.190 --> 18:33.150
in front of rodeo bulls?

18:33.190 --> 18:34.760
Mm-hmm.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.150
A baby can't do that, Chip.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.380
A baby pees in his diaper.
Big Chip doesn't do that.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.250
Baby Chip can't even walk.

18:42.290 --> 18:45.030
Big Chip can run.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.600
Big Chip can get
his own apartment.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.170
What makes you think you can't
get your own apartment?

18:49.210 --> 18:52.260
-I can't get the money
for that...
-No, no, no.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.390
It's not about the money.
Look in my eyes.

18:54.430 --> 18:58.220
-Go... deeper!
-[pounding on chest]

18:58.260 --> 19:01.270
Who's in charge of you?

19:01.310 --> 19:03.310
Let's go there. Jonah?
Tell him who's in charge.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.230
JONAH:
Uh...

19:04.270 --> 19:06.010
I forgot.

19:06.050 --> 19:08.230
You are in charge of you.

19:08.270 --> 19:11.190
What are you afraid of?

19:11.230 --> 19:13.230
I'm...

19:15.240 --> 19:18.800
What is it? Change?

19:18.850 --> 19:20.760
If I get the apartment,
then I might have...

19:20.810 --> 19:22.630
might have to change,
is that what you're saying?

19:22.680 --> 19:25.640
Yes, you'd have to earn more.
You'd have a mortgage.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.680
But you'd be happy.

19:28.730 --> 19:30.690
Uh, I want to, I...

19:30.730 --> 19:33.210
[whispering]:
I want to be happy,
I'm just frightened of it.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.300
-Aw...
-If I know how to do it.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.080
That's it, that's it, that's it.

19:37.130 --> 19:40.780
He said he's scared to be happy,but he wants to be happy.

19:40.830 --> 19:42.390
-[applause]
-He found it, everybody.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.660
You found it.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.230
Okay, everybody, he found it.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.710
[chuckles]

19:51.750 --> 19:56.280
All right, now let's get you
that apartment!

20:02.280 --> 20:03.500
-Ken.
-KEN: In the kitchen.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.500
I'm thinking
we should order a pizza.

20:05.550 --> 20:08.330
I just feel like, uh,
eating and going to bed.

20:08.380 --> 20:10.900
-Voilà!
-Oh. What is this?

20:10.940 --> 20:13.250
-You got to try this.
-Where did you get this?

20:13.290 --> 20:14.250
Olive spread.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.250
-Oh, good.
-With cheese and cracker.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.300
-Oh, my God.
-And a little sliced tomato.

20:19.340 --> 20:21.390
-You're cheering me up already.-[chuckles]

20:21.430 --> 20:25.390
-Mmm. Mmm!
-Good, huh? Yeah.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.270
And so distinctive, the taste.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.360
You know,

20:31.400 --> 20:33.970
I just wanted things
to go well for Chip.

20:34.010 --> 20:36.930
Yeah, Chip's an independent guy.He did fine today.

20:36.970 --> 20:41.060
We're only there to help out
when he needs us.

20:41.100 --> 20:44.410
You're so wise, you know?
I should listen to you more.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.280
[phone ringing]

20:46.330 --> 20:47.720
[whispering]:
I can be such a know-it-all.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.070
[Ken chuckles]

20:49.110 --> 20:50.770
Hello, Chip.

20:50.810 --> 20:51.900
Hey, Mom.

20:51.940 --> 20:53.120
Investment.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.120
Uh, Mom, I wanted to tell you

20:56.160 --> 20:58.160
about an investment opportunity.

20:58.210 --> 20:59.910
MRS. BASKETS:  Chip, I'm gonna tell you about

20:59.950 --> 21:02.390
olive "tap-pen-yah-dee."

21:02.430 --> 21:04.950
Ken just rooted
around the boxes,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.310
and he found me
a delicious crudités tray.

21:09.350 --> 21:10.310
That sounds good.

21:10.350 --> 21:12.090
It was out of this world.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.570
I just never had
anything like it.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.530
[whispering]:
Investment.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.140
Okay, yeah, I'll look into that.

21:17.180 --> 21:19.450
But-but-but, listen, hey,
there-there's a, u-um,

21:19.490 --> 21:21.360
a new condo
on the east side of town

21:21.410 --> 21:22.930
called the Bullet Towers, Mom?

21:22.970 --> 21:26.370
Oh, you found a place to live,
Chip? That's great.

21:26.410 --> 21:30.370
But I need, um...
I need a down payment.

21:30.410 --> 21:31.980
You'll pay her back.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.370
And I'll-I'll pay you back, uh,

21:33.420 --> 21:35.810
w-with interest, so it'll be
a good investment for you.

21:35.850 --> 21:37.470
-Mmm.
-KEN: What's going on?

21:37.510 --> 21:41.430
He, uh, found a-a condo,
the Bullet House, and

21:41.470 --> 21:45.210
it's in a complex and he,
uh, needs a down payment.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.210
[phone beeps]

21:47.260 --> 21:49.220
Looks like he needs us, right?

21:49.260 --> 21:51.000
Yeah.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.390
It looks like he needs us. Hmm.

21:55.310 --> 21:57.220
Yeah, I'm still here.

21:57.270 --> 21:59.440
Okay.

21:59.490 --> 22:01.490
I understand.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.970
Okay.

22:05.010 --> 22:06.360

22:08.410 --> 22:10.800
-She said yes.

22:10.850 --> 22:13.810
Yeah, yes! My favorite word.

22:13.850 --> 22:15.460

22:15.500 --> 22:17.590
