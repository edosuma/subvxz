CAR HORN HONKS

00:19.780 --> 00:21.258
Yoo-hoo!

00:21.260 --> 00:22.700
Do you want a lift?

00:29.500 --> 00:31.858
- Where are you headed?
- Hambleston.

00:31.860 --> 00:35.578
Glenda Pikes had triplets,
so I'm taking her a shepherd's pie.

00:35.580 --> 00:38.138
What do you think, Mrs M?
Isn't she divine?

00:38.140 --> 00:41.180
I think SHE should slow down.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.698
She arrived this morning.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.498
A present from Monty.
He's so wonderfully generous.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.818
Didn't think to give you
driving lessons at the same time?

00:52.820 --> 00:55.338
Sidney says I'm a very good driver.

00:55.340 --> 00:57.018
Ha!

00:57.020 --> 00:59.618
The words of a rogue and thief,
whose wages you pay.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.738
SHE HONKS THE HORN

01:01.740 --> 01:03.898
Would you keep your eyes
on the road?

01:03.900 --> 01:06.738
- Perhaps you'd prefer to walk.
- There's no maybe about it.

01:06.740 --> 01:09.978
In fact, I'd like you
to stop this car at once.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.458
Suit yourself.

What a fine mess you've got us into.

02:33.140 --> 02:35.778
Well, that's rich.
It wasn't my fault!

02:35.780 --> 02:39.458
Oh, so the wall just ran out into
the road in front of us, did it?

02:39.460 --> 02:42.738
If I recall, it was you
who asked me to stop the car.

02:42.740 --> 02:46.338
The Countess of Montague.
Fetch Sir Malcolm immediately.

02:46.340 --> 02:49.900
...you'd have known I didn't mean you
to stop there and then!

02:59.300 --> 03:03.098
Her ladyship's nose will need to be
reset under general anaesthetic.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.098
Same goes for your arm.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.658
You've got a displaced fracture,

03:06.660 --> 03:09.378
which will need operating on
when the swelling goes down.

03:09.380 --> 03:11.378
And how long is that going to take?

03:11.380 --> 03:13.738
Around three days.

03:13.740 --> 03:16.778
Until then,
I suppose I'm stuck here with you.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.138
Don't worry, Mrs McCarthy. I intend
to be out of here as soon as...

03:20.140 --> 03:22.218
Ah, Malcolm! At last.

03:22.220 --> 03:24.538
Apologies for the delay.
I was in theatre.

03:24.540 --> 03:26.138
How's Emma and the children?

03:26.140 --> 03:29.378
Oh, in finer fettle than you
at this present moment.

03:29.380 --> 03:30.698
Although, what an honour it is

03:30.700 --> 03:33.498
to have the chair of the hospital
board entrusted to our care.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.580
Quite.

03:35.740 --> 03:38.098
Do you think you could put in a call
to Dickie Frobisher?

03:38.100 --> 03:40.778
I'm sure he'll want to do
my operation in Harley Street.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.818
Yes. Of course.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.818
If you aren't concerned that it will
send out mixed messages,

03:45.820 --> 03:49.418
given your unstinting support
for the National Health Service.

03:49.420 --> 03:50.698
Well, yes, but...

03:50.700 --> 03:53.138
Indeed, if you don't have faith
in our new vision...

03:53.140 --> 03:55.260
how can the people of Britain?

03:56.620 --> 03:58.138
How indeed?

03:58.140 --> 04:00.540
But at least you have your friend
to keep you company.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.060
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT AWKWARDLY

04:10.020 --> 04:13.218
You will never guess
who the new anaesthetist is.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.017
- What are you doing?
- Have you seen
the state of this cupboard?

04:16.019 --> 04:18.137
It's an accident waiting to happen.

04:18.140 --> 04:20.498
Has no-one ever said
you sound like Matron.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.738
- It's Tony Fairfax!
- Who?

04:22.740 --> 04:25.538
He was a registrar
when I did my training at Tommies.

04:25.540 --> 04:28.258
Also known as Dr Dish.

04:28.260 --> 04:31.698
Although, I warn you, he's the
love-them-and-leave-them variety.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.418
Strictly not husband material.

04:33.420 --> 04:34.778
In which case,

04:34.780 --> 04:37.618
I'm sure Nurse Honeywell
isn't the least bit interested.

04:37.620 --> 04:41.700
There's a tower of bedpans awaiting
your attention in the sluice room.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.060
TOGETHER: Yes, Matron.

04:45.860 --> 04:49.698
So how was Mr and Mrs Beaks'
funeral?

04:49.700 --> 04:51.178
A good turnout.

04:51.180 --> 04:53.578
After 60 years together,

04:53.580 --> 04:56.378
it was a blessing
they went within days of each other.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.938
HE COUGHS POLITELY

04:57.940 --> 04:59.658
Do you find my facial injuries
amusing?

04:59.660 --> 05:01.258
- No, my lady.
- Perish the thought.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.338
Because so much as a smile
out of you

05:03.340 --> 05:05.178
will result in instant dismissal.

05:05.180 --> 05:08.178
And you, Father, can kiss goodbye
to your substantial annual donation

05:08.180 --> 05:09.738
to the roof fund.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.498
Well, you've only yourself to blame.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.658
Careering around the countryside
at that speed!

05:13.660 --> 05:16.098
Anyone would think you were trying
to kill the pair of us.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.898
I'm beginning to wish I had!

05:17.900 --> 05:20.298
Now you see
what I have to put up with?

05:20.300 --> 05:24.380
Father, how exactly are you going
to cope with me being in here?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.778
Well, we'll just have to manage.

05:28.780 --> 05:29.978
Mm.

05:29.980 --> 05:31.020
Oh...

05:35.180 --> 05:36.940
Give it here!

05:38.260 --> 05:40.420
See how high you can get.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.058
Oi!

05:46.060 --> 05:47.820
What you doing?!

06:01.420 --> 06:04.780
Sorry, Mrs Beale. No smoking
during Sir Malcolm's ward round.

06:12.340 --> 06:15.778
Good evening, Sir Malcolm
Dr Fairfax.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.780
Good evening, Matron. Lead on.

06:19.100 --> 06:23.258
We have one new arrival this
evening, transferred from casualty.

06:23.260 --> 06:25.338
Mrs Garrity, 65.

06:25.340 --> 06:27.498
Fell off a ladder picking apples.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.458
She's suffered a concussion
and a humeral fracture.

06:31.460 --> 06:35.420
The orthopaedic registrar thinks
it should be reduced in theatre.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.098
Did you think to tell
the orthopaedic reg

06:39.100 --> 06:41.738
that I've better things
to do with my time

06:41.740 --> 06:45.098
than reduce
a minimally-displaced fracture?

06:45.100 --> 06:48.538
I believe the patient
reported numbness.

06:48.540 --> 06:52.098
Dr Irvine was concerned
about neurovascular compromise.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.780
I never thought I'd see you again.

06:55.460 --> 06:56.858
Well, I never!

06:56.860 --> 06:58.820
Mr and Mrs Weston.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.218
Fair enough.

07:05.220 --> 07:07.858
Put her first on my list
in the morning.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.498
Mrs Crabbe. Suspected appendicitis.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.178
We're just waiting for her
haemoglobin test to come back.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.620
HORSE RACING COMMENTARY ON RADIO

07:29.860 --> 07:31.298
TURNS RACING COMMENTARY OFF

07:31.300 --> 07:34.300
I knocked, but nobody heard.

07:37.180 --> 07:38.220
Mrs Steele.

07:39.380 --> 07:42.978
- To what do I owe the pleasure?
- I'm your locum parish secretary,

07:42.980 --> 07:46.098
appointed by the parish council
during Mrs McCarthy's absence.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.620
- Sidney Carter.
- I know who you are.

07:49.620 --> 07:52.660
And I can see... I have my work
cut out.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.378
Right, belt-and-braces job

08:04.380 --> 08:06.460
and out of here
in double-quick time.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.338
Ready to go?

08:13.340 --> 08:14.938
I don't like her colour.

08:14.940 --> 08:17.780
I'm going to cut the gas
and increase her oxygen.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.898
She's not responding.

08:20.900 --> 08:24.460
OK. Nothing but pure O2 now.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.858
- Still not responding.
- Is there an obstruction?

08:28.860 --> 08:31.220
There's no obstruction.
Look at the bag.

08:32.539 --> 08:34.418
Are you unwell?

08:34.419 --> 08:36.780
I think the patient is the one
in need of your attention.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.938
She's stopped breathing.

08:39.940 --> 08:41.938
Adrenaline. One in 10,000.

08:41.940 --> 08:43.220
Quickly, Nurse.

08:54.540 --> 08:55.860
There's no pulse.

09:12.540 --> 09:14.420
Watch where you're going, Sergeant!

09:16.900 --> 09:20.338
Oh... the Royal and Ancient.

09:20.340 --> 09:21.938
Very swanky.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.298
What's your handicap, sir?

09:23.300 --> 09:27.898
A wife and two kids and club rules
state no women or children.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.618
All I need is a referee
and I'm on the fairway,

09:30.620 --> 09:33.098
along with the rest
of the local luminaries.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.778
Coroner's office called, sir.
Death at the hospital.

09:35.780 --> 09:38.898
And that's of interest because...?

09:38.900 --> 09:41.778
Unknown causes. The police
are obliged to investigate.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.898
Er, Sir Malcolm Braithwaite's
been informed

09:43.900 --> 09:45.498
that we'll be paying him a visit.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.778
You can tell the coroner

09:46.780 --> 09:48.778
to stick his red tape
where the sun don't shine!

09:48.780 --> 09:51.818
As if Her Majesty's Constabulary
have got nothing better to do

09:51.820 --> 09:54.580
than investigate non-suspicious...

09:55.660 --> 09:57.578
Sir Malcolm Braithwaite?

09:57.580 --> 10:00.540
Mm. He's the chief surgeon
at St Luke's, sir.

10:01.540 --> 10:04.060
He's the secretary
for the membership committee.

10:05.260 --> 10:08.380
I spy a silver lining, Sergeant.

10:11.220 --> 10:13.460
Well, chop chop!
What are you waiting for?

10:19.060 --> 10:21.418
Nurse, what's going on?

10:21.420 --> 10:24.018
Everyone seems to be
at sixes and sevens.

10:24.020 --> 10:27.740
I'm afraid Mrs Garrity passed away
on the operating table this morning.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.140
- Nurse...
- Ah-ah-ah!

10:36.060 --> 10:38.818
- What happened?
- No-one knows.

10:38.820 --> 10:43.138
The operation hadn't even started
and it was only a fractured humerus.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.538
Not that there's anything for you
to worry about.

10:45.540 --> 10:48.018
Although, there will be
a full investigation, of course.

10:48.020 --> 10:50.778
When you've finished alarming
the pre-operative patients,

10:50.780 --> 10:52.698
Mrs Dolan's hernia needs dressing.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.578
Yes, nurse.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.258
And for goodness' sake,
change that apron

10:57.260 --> 11:00.698
before Matron catches you
and blows a gasket.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.698
They're painting the railings.
I must have brushed past them.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.658
Damn and blast! That's me fined five
shillings if it doesn't come out.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.218
Paint is the very devil.

11:08.220 --> 11:11.618
Try turpentine and ammonia,
mixed with a cup of salt.

11:11.620 --> 11:14.660
Thanks, Mrs McCarthy.
You're a life-saver.

11:17.980 --> 11:20.498
The patient's respiration
started to fail,

11:20.500 --> 11:24.578
so I cut the nitrous oxide
and put her onto pure O2.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.178
She failed to respond,

11:26.180 --> 11:28.298
so I administered adrenaline.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.140
Sadly, to no avail.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.298
And has the equipment been checked?

11:33.300 --> 11:36.258
Fully checked,
before and after the operation.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.138
The procedure was textbook.

11:38.140 --> 11:40.578
I'm afraid these things happen,
Inspector.

11:40.580 --> 11:43.858
Anaesthetics is still very much
in the unchartered waters

11:43.860 --> 11:45.538
of the medical profession.

11:45.540 --> 11:47.978
Sir Malcolm alludes to the fact
that, six months ago,

11:47.980 --> 11:51.098
a patient died whilst under
anaesthetic in my care,

11:51.100 --> 11:53.178
leading to
a General Medical Council enquiry,

11:53.180 --> 11:55.460
at which I was fully exonerated.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.538
I can provide you with a full copy
of the report,

11:58.540 --> 12:00.618
if you'd care to read it.
- God, no!

12:00.620 --> 12:03.218
Here's the rub, Inspector.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.658
We are in the vanguard

12:04.660 --> 12:06.658
of the greatest social experiment
in history.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.618
The National Health Service.

12:08.620 --> 12:12.138
Providing free medical care
to all at the point of delivery.

12:12.140 --> 12:15.580
The last thing we need right now
is anyone doubting us.

12:18.660 --> 12:20.140
Oh, do you play?

12:21.620 --> 12:25.698
I'm up for membership
at the R and A, as it happens.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.978
Oh, well...

12:27.980 --> 12:30.378
we're always keen to welcome

12:30.380 --> 12:32.698
like-minded pillars
of the establishment.

12:32.700 --> 12:35.900
I'm sure you'll find us
all a mutually supportive lot.

12:37.660 --> 12:39.380
Anything else, Sergeant?

12:41.060 --> 12:42.980
Then I think were finished here.

12:44.660 --> 12:46.100
See you in the clubhouse.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.460
CHURCH BELL TOLLS

12:59.380 --> 13:00.700
Argh!

13:04.500 --> 13:06.578
Balaclava... Nice touch.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.378
Element of surprise.

13:08.380 --> 13:11.698
Your reaction times
are getting faster, Father.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.098
Father Brown?

13:14.100 --> 13:16.178
Mrs Steele.

13:16.180 --> 13:19.498
Erm, Sid was just teaching me
the noble art of self-defence.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.818
I see.

13:20.820 --> 13:23.778
Mother Augustine is here.
I put her in the study.

13:23.780 --> 13:25.218
Right. Yes.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.420
I'm on my way.

13:28.380 --> 13:32.258
If you could restrain yourself
from attacking her.

13:32.260 --> 13:34.818
HE WINCES IN PAIN

13:34.820 --> 13:36.300
I'll be off.

13:37.740 --> 13:40.818
I find myself wondering
why would a man of the cloth

13:40.820 --> 13:43.578
have a need to defend himself?

13:43.580 --> 13:45.898
You never know
when you might get in trouble.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.578
Trouble begets trouble.

13:47.580 --> 13:51.658
And from what I hear, you, young
man, are trouble with a capital T.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.098
You reckon, do you?

13:53.100 --> 13:55.018
Father Brown
should be doing God's work,

13:55.020 --> 13:58.378
instead of brawling in public
in the churchyard.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.978
Well, Father Brown
is not your average priest.

14:00.980 --> 14:03.098
I don't know what
Bridget McCarthy was thinking,

14:03.100 --> 14:06.420
but I think he'll find
I run a tighter ship.

14:08.340 --> 14:09.660
Good luck with that!

14:31.340 --> 14:33.978
At last,
a nurse next to a frying pan

14:33.980 --> 14:35.738
and my stomach's turning
somersaults.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.178
Be a good girl
and rustle up some bacon and eggs.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.458
Yes, Doctor.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.418
Just as soon as
I've changed the dressing

14:41.420 --> 14:43.258
on Mrs Dolan's infected hernia.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.098
I'd heard you were a feisty one.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.218
Only that Mrs Dolan's stomach
is in rather worse shape than yours

14:48.220 --> 14:50.418
at this precise moment.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.818
Look at the state of you!

14:51.820 --> 14:54.418
What do you expect, after running
all the way across the quad?

14:54.420 --> 14:57.778
And you'll never guess...
I think I know how Mrs Garrity died.

14:57.780 --> 15:00.058
And I don't think
it was of natural causes.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.138
Which means, she was murdered.

15:02.140 --> 15:04.298
There's enough unfounded gossip
flying around

15:04.300 --> 15:05.538
without you adding to it.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.778
Take no notice.
She's prone to exaggeration.

15:07.780 --> 15:10.698
I can prove it and then we'll see
what the police say, shall we?

15:10.700 --> 15:13.938
Why are there patients out of bed
when Sir Malcolm is here

15:13.940 --> 15:15.820
to do his post-operative checks?

15:26.140 --> 15:27.938
METALLIC CLANG

15:27.940 --> 15:29.460
Who's there?

15:53.620 --> 15:56.420
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

16:01.180 --> 16:03.300
Aaaaahhhhhhh!

16:04.900 --> 16:07.418
Good morning, Father.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.300
Good morning, Mrs Steele.

16:14.380 --> 16:17.218
I usually see to my own breakfast.

16:17.220 --> 16:19.058
You're an elusive man
to get hold of,

16:19.060 --> 16:22.058
so I thought we could start as we
mean to go on with morning meetings.

16:22.060 --> 16:25.698
I've moved the first
holy communicants to this afternoon,

16:25.700 --> 16:29.098
in between Reverend Frobisher
and the African orphans' fundraiser,

16:29.100 --> 16:32.180
so you can spend the morning
working on your homily...

16:33.140 --> 16:34.500
...uninterrupted.

16:39.420 --> 16:41.418
Good morning, Lady Felicia.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.538
I'm Dr Fairfax, your anaesthetist.

16:43.540 --> 16:46.578
- Is this the equipment
that was used for Mrs Garrity?
- Certainly not.

16:46.580 --> 16:48.418
The theatre was cleared out
afterwards

16:48.420 --> 16:50.178
and all the equipment put in storage.

16:50.180 --> 16:51.258
There's nothing to it.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.498
This black tank is the anaesthetic
- nitrous oxide.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.858
- Green is carbon dioxide...
- Isn't that poisonous?

16:55.860 --> 16:57.978
Not when mixed with oxygen.

16:57.980 --> 16:59.978
That's this black and white chap
here.

16:59.980 --> 17:02.138
Now, I'm going to give you
a little injection

17:02.140 --> 17:04.300
with something to make you sleepy.

17:06.619 --> 17:10.498
If you could count back from ten
for me?

17:10.500 --> 17:12.098
Ten.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.538
Nine.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.218
Eight.

17:15.220 --> 17:17.538
Seven.

17:17.540 --> 17:18.978
Six.

17:18.980 --> 17:20.380
Five.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.417
Four.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.700
Three...

17:30.660 --> 17:32.740
Father! Are you in there, Father?

17:34.780 --> 17:36.898
This door's always left open.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.818
Doubtless why Father Brown
is so prone to distraction.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.578
Ah!

17:41.580 --> 17:43.018
He's writing his homily

17:43.020 --> 17:45.258
and under strict instructions
not to be disturbed.

17:45.260 --> 17:47.698
Yeah, well, her ladyship's
been trying to get hold of him.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.698
Last night,
a nurse at St Luke's was murdered

17:49.700 --> 17:51.258
and she needs to see him urgently.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.378
Whatever for? He's not a policeman.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.298
Trust me, he'll want to know.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.138
No doubt he would.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.858
I'm well aware of his little
crime-fighting hobby,

17:59.860 --> 18:01.818
but uncertain how kindly
his parishioners

18:01.820 --> 18:04.378
take to these deviations
to his duties.

18:04.380 --> 18:07.260
Do we understand each other,
Mr Carter?

18:09.860 --> 18:11.460
We most certainly do, Mrs Steele.

18:12.580 --> 18:14.260
See you around.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.340
Not if I have my way.

18:54.620 --> 18:58.058
Six weeks ago, we were asked
to investigate some missing drugs.

18:58.060 --> 18:59.378
Specifically, pethidine.

18:59.380 --> 19:01.780
I fail to see
what this has to do with it.

19:03.140 --> 19:06.458
You were the last people
to see Nurse Fletcher

19:06.460 --> 19:09.298
before she left the ward
at the end of her shift.

19:09.300 --> 19:12.058
- Which would have been at...?
- Ten.

19:12.060 --> 19:16.058
When everybody headed to their beds,
except Nurse Fletcher,

19:16.060 --> 19:20.140
who inexplicably decided
to take a detour to theatre...

19:21.460 --> 19:23.978
...where I believe
the drugs are kept.

19:23.980 --> 19:26.698
Securely, under lock and key.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.338
Ah, yes...

19:29.340 --> 19:30.380
Key.

19:32.940 --> 19:37.940
Nurse Fletcher dropped this
when she was killed.

19:39.940 --> 19:43.218
Does anyone know which lock it fits?

19:43.220 --> 19:46.538
It's the key to the nurses'
common room. We've all got one.

19:46.540 --> 19:50.338
Not that it's ever locked. No doubt,
there was a doctor involved.

19:50.340 --> 19:53.938
Young nurses tend to have
one-track minds, Inspector.

19:53.940 --> 19:57.180
- A lovers' tiff gone wrong?
- Peggy wasn't the type!

19:58.860 --> 20:02.018
Something to add, Nurse Honeywell?

20:02.020 --> 20:04.178
It's probably nothing.

20:04.180 --> 20:06.338
Humour me.

20:06.340 --> 20:09.698
Peggy said Mrs Garrity
had been murdered

20:09.700 --> 20:11.978
and was threatening
to go to the police.

20:11.980 --> 20:15.498
- Said this to...?
- Oh, all of us, I suppose.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.298
At least, we were all there.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.578
This is ridiculous.

20:18.580 --> 20:21.058
The postmortem revealed
no anomalies.

20:21.060 --> 20:24.378
We've put it down as a rare reaction
to the anaesthetic.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.858
Were any of you acquainted with
Mrs Garrity

20:26.860 --> 20:28.700
before her admission to hospital?

20:31.420 --> 20:33.578
Something else?

20:33.580 --> 20:35.140
Poor Peggy.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.060
I wish there was something
I could do.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.020
You could light a candle
for her soul.

20:44.140 --> 20:45.738
The church is always open.

20:45.740 --> 20:47.338
I think she'd like that.

20:47.340 --> 20:48.738
Padre...

20:48.740 --> 20:50.858
You're like a bad penny.

20:50.860 --> 20:53.340
I am the hospital chaplain.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.740
Course you are.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.858
A patient dies
on the operating table.

21:04.860 --> 21:07.058
Nurse Fletcher announces
there's something fishy

21:07.060 --> 21:09.098
and a few hours later
she's murdered.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.658
Doris Garrity
was a harmless old lady.

21:11.660 --> 21:13.780
To whom no-one claims acquaintance.

21:15.220 --> 21:19.178
I believe Nurse Honeywell knows more
than she's letting on.

21:19.180 --> 21:22.620
In the meantime,
let's keep out noses to the ground.

21:35.380 --> 21:36.858
Hello.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.818
I was sure I had tuppence

21:38.820 --> 21:41.620
and stealing from God
is a frightful sin.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.340
Have this one on me.

21:48.220 --> 21:49.660
Thank you.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.700
I'm sorry about your friend.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.578
We were hardly that.

21:57.580 --> 21:59.658
I thought she was
a rather silly girl

21:59.660 --> 22:01.580
and a terrible attention seeker.

22:02.740 --> 22:05.578
Which must make me
a very wicked person.

22:05.580 --> 22:08.020
Or a refreshingly honest one.

22:11.700 --> 22:16.258
So when Nurse Fletcher announced
that Mrs Garrity was murdered...

22:16.260 --> 22:19.980
I thought she was showing off
to Dr Dish.

22:21.180 --> 22:25.100
So... you paid no attention
to her theory?

22:26.660 --> 22:28.458
After all,

22:28.460 --> 22:30.940
it's not as if any of you
knew Mrs Garrity?

22:32.620 --> 22:34.100
Exactly.

22:37.220 --> 22:39.018
But...?

22:39.020 --> 22:42.058
It was only when she was murdered

22:42.060 --> 22:45.700
I remembered something about the
evening Mrs Garrity was brought in.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.618
Well, I never!

22:48.620 --> 22:50.580
Mr and Mrs Weston.

22:52.740 --> 22:57.138
I assumed it was the concussion,
as none of us is called Weston.

22:57.140 --> 22:58.940
I expect it's nothing.

23:00.260 --> 23:02.100
You must think me very silly.

23:04.620 --> 23:06.538
On the contrary.

23:06.540 --> 23:09.300
I think you are
a highly intelligent young woman.

23:10.980 --> 23:12.858
Father...

23:12.860 --> 23:15.898
And there was I thinking
you were in your study...

23:15.900 --> 23:17.978
writing your homily.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.738
Crikey. I'd better hop it or Matron
will have my guts for garters.

23:21.740 --> 23:23.458
You must be from St Luke's.

23:23.460 --> 23:25.738
Although, I don't think
I've seen you at mass.

23:25.740 --> 23:26.978
Hardly.

23:26.980 --> 23:28.738
I'm not a Catholic.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.938
Nor anything else, for that matter.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.980
Then, please, don't let me keep you.

23:39.940 --> 23:44.980
Cast your mind back
to last night... and dig deeper.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.058
Mm...

23:48.060 --> 23:50.178
And deeper...

23:50.180 --> 23:52.218
Mm...

23:52.220 --> 23:54.178
What do you call this again?

23:54.180 --> 23:56.580
Transmemory meditation.
It's all the rage in London.

23:57.940 --> 24:01.258
Apparently, our brains process
only a fraction of what we perceive.

24:01.260 --> 24:04.738
Yours might. I have told you
everything I remember.

24:04.740 --> 24:07.660
One more time. The slightest detail
may be important.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.100
Mm...

24:16.340 --> 24:19.818
She was breathless
because she'd run across the quad.

24:19.820 --> 24:21.938
Look at the state of you!

24:21.940 --> 24:25.180
Well, what do you expect after
running all the way across the quad?

24:27.260 --> 24:30.220
She gave Nurse Honeywell a file.

24:31.620 --> 24:33.420
Nurse Honeywell put the file
in the desk.

24:36.060 --> 24:37.578
So...

24:37.580 --> 24:40.938
Doris Garrity...

24:40.940 --> 24:44.858
dies on the table under
the anaesthetic care of Dr Fairfax.

24:44.860 --> 24:47.138
A recent arrival from St Thomas',

24:47.140 --> 24:49.658
where he was the subject

24:49.660 --> 24:53.458
of a GMC enquiry

24:53.460 --> 24:56.578
for topping a patient.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.538
Allegedly, sir. He was exoner...

24:58.540 --> 25:00.260
Whoa! Train of thought, Sergeant.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.138
And, coincidentally,

25:04.140 --> 25:06.298
the same hospital
where Nurse Fletcher

25:06.300 --> 25:08.578
did her preliminary training.

25:08.580 --> 25:11.578
Who, having deduced that
Doris' death was dodgy,

25:11.580 --> 25:13.658
was dumb enough to announce it
to all and sundry

25:13.660 --> 25:15.938
before being bumped off.

25:15.940 --> 25:18.300
The single common denominator
being...

25:21.980 --> 25:25.058
Unless it's raffle tickets for
the church roof, I'm not interested.

25:25.060 --> 25:27.098
If it is raffle tickets
for the church roof,

25:27.100 --> 25:29.058
I'm still not interested!

25:29.060 --> 25:31.340
I think the key is Mrs Garrity.

25:32.540 --> 25:34.578
Everyone claims her to have been
a stranger,

25:34.580 --> 25:37.018
but Nurse Honeywell said
she recognised someone

25:37.020 --> 25:38.818
the night she was admitted.

25:38.820 --> 25:41.898
- Who?
- She mentioned the name Weston.

25:41.900 --> 25:46.100
I think, if you find the connection,
you will also find the murderer.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.498
Genius!

25:48.500 --> 25:51.340
If only one of them
was called Weston.

25:52.940 --> 25:54.978
You think you've found your man?

25:54.980 --> 25:57.178
I'm sure you've got your own work
to do.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.458
Souls to save, sinners to punish,

26:00.460 --> 26:02.058
children to indoctrinate...

26:02.060 --> 26:03.660
Adios, Padre!

26:07.780 --> 26:10.980
Check to see if any of them
have ever gone by the name Weston.

26:23.700 --> 26:26.338
Nurse Honeywell.
Could you step in here, please?

26:26.340 --> 26:27.740
Yes, Matron.

26:34.900 --> 26:36.778
You're seven minutes late.

26:36.780 --> 26:39.738
I was at church,
lighting a candle for Peggy.

26:39.740 --> 26:42.778
I take that to mean
you disbelieve me?

26:42.780 --> 26:44.698
Dallying with a doctor, more like.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.538
I know your type.

26:46.540 --> 26:48.298
You don't know me at all.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.858
I've seen you sneaking out
of the doctors' common room

26:50.860 --> 26:53.058
in the middle of the night.
- Which begs the question,

26:53.060 --> 26:57.020
why you were out of bed wandering
the hospital at that time.

27:03.220 --> 27:05.058
What on earth are you are doing?

27:05.060 --> 27:07.458
Ah! There you are, Mrs M.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.778
It's not time to play
hide and seek now.

27:10.780 --> 27:13.298
She's been having these
little episodes recently.

27:13.300 --> 27:14.618
She's going a bit gaga.

27:14.620 --> 27:16.338
Come along, Mrs McCarthy.

27:16.340 --> 27:18.338
Let's get you back to bed.

27:18.340 --> 27:20.378
We put it down to advancing age.

27:20.380 --> 27:21.780
Oh!

27:44.020 --> 27:45.980
HE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR

27:51.940 --> 27:54.500
One minute, she were picking apples.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.340
The next morning, she'd gone.

28:01.140 --> 28:04.060
It were only a broken shoulder.

28:05.420 --> 28:07.618
Not that I blame the hospital.

28:07.620 --> 28:10.058
Quality care...

28:10.060 --> 28:12.300
and didn't charge her a penny.

28:13.580 --> 28:15.498
Mr Garrity, may I ask you,

28:15.500 --> 28:18.860
do you recognise the names
Mr and Mrs Weston?

28:20.980 --> 28:23.140
She mentioned them?

28:24.420 --> 28:26.220
I wonder what brought that back?

28:28.060 --> 28:29.580
Wasn't their real names.

28:30.620 --> 28:32.338
Just what Doris called them.

28:32.340 --> 28:34.538
On account of the bank holiday.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.498
The bank holiday?

28:36.500 --> 28:38.180
1931.

28:39.420 --> 28:41.420
Weston-super-Mare.

28:43.580 --> 28:47.940
Wettest May Day for 25 years.

28:49.340 --> 28:53.060
The wind blew us off the beach and
into the town to look for our tea.

28:54.900 --> 28:58.018
Doris wanted kippers
from Lyons' Corner House,

28:58.020 --> 29:00.618
which meant walking up
by the town hall.

29:00.620 --> 29:03.740
Then this taxi drew up...

29:04.860 --> 29:06.580
...and a young couple jumped out.

29:08.340 --> 29:10.820
Asked us to witness their wedding.

29:11.940 --> 29:14.860
Oh, Doris were chuffed to bits.

29:15.860 --> 29:17.940
She thought it was so romantic.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.420
The Westons...

29:23.380 --> 29:25.940
Don't suppose you remember
their real name?

29:27.620 --> 29:30.380
Oh...
No, it's such a long time ago.

29:31.620 --> 29:34.258
They were a handsome couple.

29:34.260 --> 29:36.778
I've got a photo somewhere.

29:36.780 --> 29:40.338
- Would you like me to fetch the album?
- Yes, please.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.220
And I'll put the kettle on.

29:43.420 --> 29:45.138
There we are.

29:45.140 --> 29:47.138
I'll fetch you a nice cup of tea

29:47.140 --> 29:50.020
and there'll be no need
for any more wandering around.

29:53.060 --> 29:54.338
Gaga!

29:54.340 --> 29:57.058
I'm very sorry. But it was the best
I could think of on the spot.

29:57.060 --> 29:58.698
That was the best
you could think of?

29:58.700 --> 30:00.538
Well, it got you out of a sticky
situation.

30:00.540 --> 30:03.298
A situation I would not be in
were it not for you!

30:03.300 --> 30:05.940
So... did you find out
what was in that file?

30:07.020 --> 30:08.978
Yes. I did.

30:08.980 --> 30:11.458
It was the linen count.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.298
Linen count?

30:13.300 --> 30:15.778
It means she was in
the laundry room.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.698
Counting the linen.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.138
Oh, I see.

30:19.140 --> 30:22.698
So... if she ran across the quad,

30:22.700 --> 30:26.340
that means that the laundry
is that building there.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.900
Weston-super-Mare, May, 1931.

30:32.340 --> 30:35.500
That's us and the Westons
outside the town hall.

30:40.180 --> 30:41.340
Oh...

30:42.540 --> 30:43.898
I see.

30:43.900 --> 30:45.940
TELEPHONE RINGS

30:48.300 --> 30:49.900
St Mary's Presbytery.

30:51.420 --> 30:53.738
Alas, Mrs McCarthy, he's gone AWOL.

30:53.740 --> 30:55.898
Well, he usually turns up
in the end.

30:55.900 --> 30:59.458
And when he does, could you
please give him an urgent message?

30:59.460 --> 31:01.098
Fire away.

31:01.100 --> 31:05.818
Just tell him, I have important
information for him about the murder

31:05.820 --> 31:08.218
and I would like him to call
into the hospital

31:08.220 --> 31:10.138
at his earliest convenience.

31:10.140 --> 31:12.298
I'll make sure he gets it.

31:12.300 --> 31:14.818
Thank you. Goodbye, Mrs Steele.

31:14.820 --> 31:16.580
Goodbye, Mrs McCarthy.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.820
Drink this, Mrs McCarthy.

32:33.820 --> 32:36.340
- What time is it, Nurse?
- Just after three.

32:38.700 --> 32:41.218
Well, that's very early
for my medication.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.420
This is to make you sleepy
before your operation.

32:44.380 --> 32:47.818
But this morning, you said the
swelling hadn't gone down enough.

32:47.820 --> 32:51.338
It was decided that your operation
would be brought forward a day.

32:51.340 --> 32:52.500
Oh...

33:20.420 --> 33:22.018
Father, thank goodness!

33:22.020 --> 33:24.458
I think I know how
Mrs Garrity was killed.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.460
I think I know who and why.

33:35.460 --> 33:36.898
Where is Mrs McCarthy?

33:36.900 --> 33:39.258
She's been taken to theatre.

33:39.260 --> 33:41.098
That's impossible.

33:41.100 --> 33:44.538
She was told only this morning
that her arm was still too swollen.

33:44.540 --> 33:46.060
Quick!

33:47.460 --> 33:48.858
Ready to go?

33:48.860 --> 33:52.578
She's looking a little flat.
I'm going to increase her oxygen.

33:52.580 --> 33:54.098
She's not responding.

33:54.100 --> 33:57.100
Not again?
OK, nothing but oxygen this time.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.420
- She's still not responding.
- Adrenaline.

34:15.340 --> 34:16.980
There's no pulse.

34:24.540 --> 34:28.018
- Turn off the oxygen!
- Are you insane?
This woman's in respiratory arrest!

34:28.020 --> 34:30.540
- I said, turn it off!
- All right, all right, have it your way.

34:32.179 --> 34:33.420
Nobody move.

34:41.100 --> 34:44.458
- She's breathing.
- Can someone tell me
what the hell is happening here?

34:44.460 --> 34:46.058
Nurse Fletcher found this gown

34:46.060 --> 34:48.498
when she was doing the linen count.
Black paint.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.138
How could a sterile gown
get smeared with paint

34:51.139 --> 34:53.978
when it came from
a sterile operating theatre?

34:53.980 --> 34:58.060
She had a key.
I think she was about to do this...

35:00.900 --> 35:03.098
Carbon dioxide.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.618
Poisoned air.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.658
I think, with all this paint
lying around,

35:06.660 --> 35:08.058
that's how they got the idea.

35:08.060 --> 35:11.258
- Are you saying that someone painted
the carbon dioxide tank?
- Yes, I am.

35:11.260 --> 35:13.618
And they put it
where the oxygen should be.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.418
Their only mistake
was underestimating

35:15.420 --> 35:18.100
how long the paint would take to dry.
- Let me see that.

35:23.940 --> 35:26.020
Now, hang on!
This wasn't down to me.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.698
No, it wasn't.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.458
Doris Garrity was murdered

35:32.460 --> 35:34.738
because she recognised somebody
from her past.

35:34.740 --> 35:36.500
Is that not the case, Sir Malcolm?

35:37.780 --> 35:39.898
I don't know why
you're looking at me?

35:39.900 --> 35:41.538
A kind woman, who did a good deed.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.938
Little did she know
that witnessing a marriage

35:43.940 --> 35:46.778
would also mean she was signing
her future death sentence.

35:46.780 --> 35:50.140
Well, I'd hardly call it
a... proper marriage.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.260
More a moment of
adolescent rashness.

35:57.420 --> 36:00.058
It was my first year
in medical school

36:00.060 --> 36:02.580
and Rita was a... Tiller Girl.

36:04.180 --> 36:05.978
Six weeks later, it was all over.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.180
But you didn't divorce her, did you?

36:09.780 --> 36:12.458
When I married you and Lady Emma,

36:12.460 --> 36:15.738
your entry in the register
declares you to be a bachelor.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.058
Emma's Catholic.

36:18.060 --> 36:19.820
She couldn't marry a divorcee.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.538
It was a harmless white lie.

36:24.540 --> 36:27.980
Until Doris Garrity came back
into your world.

36:29.660 --> 36:32.058
She could have exposed you
as a bigamist.

36:32.060 --> 36:33.460
I did it to protect them.

36:34.780 --> 36:36.620
I had no choice.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.140
But you did have a choice,
didn't you, Sir Malcolm?

36:41.780 --> 36:45.578
You could have confessed your crime
and asked for forgiveness.

36:45.580 --> 36:49.258
And it is not too late
to throw yourself on God's mercy.

36:49.260 --> 36:50.738
No, no.

36:50.740 --> 36:52.580
I'd rather take my own chances.

36:53.620 --> 36:55.180
Now, this...

36:56.100 --> 36:57.220
...is Pentothal.

36:58.540 --> 37:01.498
It will stop your heart
in 15 seconds.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.858
Now, be a good girl

37:03.860 --> 37:05.420
and come quietly.

37:11.380 --> 37:13.498
Dr Fairfax is in theatre.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.978
Then, we'll wait.

37:14.980 --> 37:16.778
A discreet and speedy resolution

37:16.780 --> 37:20.378
and Sir Malcolm's undying gratitude
will nail the application.

37:20.380 --> 37:22.138
Keep walking.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.578
Urgh!

37:23.580 --> 37:25.378
Arrest this man!

37:25.380 --> 37:27.738
He murdered Mrs Garrity
and Nurse Fletcher!

37:27.740 --> 37:29.178
Quickly!

37:29.180 --> 37:31.100
Sergeant...!

37:33.020 --> 37:37.058
Malcolm Braithwaite, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of the murders

37:37.060 --> 37:39.298
of Doris Garrity and Peggy Fletcher.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.138
You are not obliged to say anything,
unless you wish to do so,

37:42.140 --> 37:45.940
but anything you say may be taken
down and will be given in evidence.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.818
KNOCKING

37:48.820 --> 37:49.860
Enter.

37:51.940 --> 37:53.578
You wanted to see me, Matron?

37:53.580 --> 37:56.098
It seems you've found me out.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.978
I noticed the side effects.

37:58.980 --> 38:01.538
Mood swings, dizziness,
blurred vision.

38:01.540 --> 38:04.898
You seem very knowledgeable
about the side effects of pethidine.

38:04.900 --> 38:07.018
- I'm going to be a doctor.
- Don't be absurd!

38:07.020 --> 38:09.338
I've applied to medical school.

38:09.340 --> 38:11.778
And the reason I was in
the doctors' common room

38:11.780 --> 38:13.218
in the middle of the night

38:13.220 --> 38:16.178
was I needed the textbook
to swot for my entrance exam.

38:16.180 --> 38:19.900
- I thought...
- My only interest
in doctors is becoming one.

38:22.620 --> 38:25.738
This is my letter of resignation.

38:25.740 --> 38:28.658
I hope you'll spare me
the indignity of giving a reason.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.660
And I hope you'll reconsider.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.698
But I'm a thief and a drug addict.

38:34.700 --> 38:37.978
And I happen to believe
that drug addiction is an illness,

38:37.980 --> 38:41.300
which should be treated,
not punished.

38:42.580 --> 38:45.658
Dr Brittain
is a consultant psychiatrist

38:45.660 --> 38:47.980
running a drugs
rehabilitation programme.

38:50.540 --> 38:53.820
You can be assured
of the utmost discretion.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.658
It seems I've misjudged you, Nurse.

39:02.660 --> 39:05.098
You're not the first.

39:05.100 --> 39:07.100
And I doubt you'll be the last.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.020
Father, can I say something?

39:17.140 --> 39:18.540
On the record.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.620
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

39:35.380 --> 39:37.820
It's been five days
since my last confession.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.980
And...

39:43.020 --> 39:44.540
...it was all my fault.

39:45.740 --> 39:47.020
Go on.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.900
That ruddy car!

39:53.780 --> 39:57.260
It was a surprise present
from Monty, you see?

40:00.380 --> 40:02.218
- I see.
- I was in such a rage,

40:02.220 --> 40:05.058
I think part of me wanted to wrap
his wretched guilt present

40:05.060 --> 40:07.098
round a tree.

40:07.100 --> 40:11.180
Mrs M was right.
I was... driving recklessly fast.

40:12.260 --> 40:13.578
God will forgive you.

40:13.580 --> 40:16.060
It's not God's forgiveness
I'm worried about.

40:17.220 --> 40:20.420
She was taking a shepherd's pie
to Glenda Pike.

40:22.020 --> 40:25.300
Three miles on foot, because
the bus doesn't go to Hambleston.

40:26.540 --> 40:28.460
And that's Mrs M all over.

40:29.700 --> 40:32.140
Always helping,
never asking for thanks.

40:33.380 --> 40:35.780
And it's my fault she's lying here!

40:37.660 --> 40:40.938
I just want her to know
how very sorry I am.

40:40.940 --> 40:43.018
SHE SOBS

40:43.020 --> 40:44.900
I think she does.

40:46.980 --> 40:49.540
Welcome back, Mrs M.

40:53.900 --> 40:55.020
Come in, come in.

40:57.540 --> 40:58.580
Ah...!

41:00.140 --> 41:02.500
Oh, there was no need for this fuss.

41:03.540 --> 41:06.338
Please, Mrs M, take a load off..

41:06.340 --> 41:08.220
Sidney, thank you.

41:10.020 --> 41:11.260
Oh, it's a cake.

41:12.380 --> 41:15.420
- I made it myself.
- Yes, I can see that.

41:16.620 --> 41:19.618
I think I may need
to do some baking.

41:19.620 --> 41:21.178
Only if you feel up to it.

41:21.180 --> 41:22.220
Oh...

41:25.540 --> 41:27.178
Are you still here?

41:27.180 --> 41:29.380
For as long as I'm needed.

41:31.580 --> 41:35.020
Well, now that my right-hand man
has been returned to me...

41:36.380 --> 41:37.778
that won't be necessary.

41:37.780 --> 41:42.378
With respect, what good is a
right-hand man lacking a right hand?

41:42.380 --> 41:45.058
Ha-ha! She'll manage.

41:45.060 --> 41:48.018
Or a parish secretary
who cannot type.

41:48.020 --> 41:50.818
So until Mrs McCarthy
is fully recovered,

41:50.820 --> 41:54.018
a matter of some weeks,
so I believe,

41:54.020 --> 41:57.578
it's been agreed by the parish
council that I will fill the breach.

41:57.580 --> 42:00.978
Now, I have the newsletter
to take to the printer,

42:00.980 --> 42:03.938
so I'll see you bright and early
tomorrow morning, Father.

42:03.940 --> 42:05.898
Not so fast, Mrs Steele.

42:05.900 --> 42:08.578
If all that's required
is a right hand,

42:08.580 --> 42:10.780
then mine
is at Mrs McCarthy's disposal.

42:12.140 --> 42:15.098
Naturally, my left is included,
as well.

42:15.100 --> 42:17.938
I hardly think her ladyship
is qualified for the role.

42:17.940 --> 42:19.738
Au contraire, Mrs Steele.

42:19.740 --> 42:23.498
I spent two years behind
an MOD desk during the war

42:23.500 --> 42:25.338
and have 60 words a minute.

42:25.340 --> 42:29.378
Not to mention shorthand.
Isn't that right, milady?

42:29.380 --> 42:31.138
Absolutely, shorthand.

42:31.140 --> 42:34.858
So... Father Brown will no longer
be requiring your assistance.

42:34.860 --> 42:37.258
I shall let the parish council know
in person.

42:37.260 --> 42:39.058
I doubt there'll be any dissent.

42:39.060 --> 42:40.980
Can I show you the door?

42:42.860 --> 42:46.298
SHE PROTESTS

42:46.300 --> 42:49.538
60 words per minute and shorthand?

42:49.540 --> 42:50.778
Hardly.

42:50.780 --> 42:54.098
I spent most of the time answering
phones and organising soirees.

42:54.100 --> 42:56.338
Actually,
clouds of war notwithstanding,

42:56.340 --> 42:57.978
it was all rather a wheeze.

42:57.980 --> 43:00.538
A pair of hands that can neither
type nor do shorthand.

43:00.540 --> 43:02.578
That's just marvellous!

43:02.580 --> 43:04.498
I'm sure I can pick it up.

43:04.500 --> 43:07.098
Only you could make
such a ridiculous utterance.

43:07.100 --> 43:08.658
I was trying to get you
out of a hole.

43:08.660 --> 43:10.260
Yes, a hole I am in because of you!

43:11.220 --> 43:13.658
From now on, I suppose we'll be
joined at the hip

43:13.660 --> 43:15.298
for the foreseeable future.

43:15.300 --> 43:17.820
Well, there's gratitude for you.
Mrs McCarthy...

43:19.580 --> 43:21.458
Lady Felicia...

43:21.460 --> 43:22.860
Welcome back!
