00:17.025 --> 00:18.191
Ohh!

00:26.000 --> 00:28.168
Enjoying family time?

00:31.639 --> 00:35.809
My family has other plans.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.284
Batman.

00:44.352 --> 00:45.719
I was wondering when--

00:45.787 --> 00:48.255
Ha ha ha!

00:53.528 --> 00:56.363
Oh. Boy Wonder.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.865
The Bat sent you to drag
me off to prison?

00:58.933 --> 01:01.101
Frankly, I'm underwhelmed.

01:01.169 --> 01:03.270
Great, but I'm kind of
in a hurry here.

01:03.338 --> 01:06.740
Kids--always in such a rush.

01:06.808 --> 01:10.877
I prefer to preserve
these moments forever.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.447
Not talking to you.

01:28.096 --> 01:31.565
Ha ha ha!

01:31.632 --> 01:33.233
Unh!

01:33.301 --> 01:35.035
Ohh!

01:40.641 --> 01:43.276
Finally! I was wondering
what a guy had to do to get

01:43.344 --> 01:46.847
A little attention
around here.

01:46.914 --> 01:48.749
Unh!

01:48.816 --> 01:50.884
Junior's doing
this for attention?

01:55.423 --> 01:56.623
I'm telling you now.

01:56.691 --> 01:58.992
This little distraction
better not interfere.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.776
Ha ha ha! Kid had
a glass jaw.

02:15.843 --> 02:17.511
Hilarious. Can we go?

02:17.578 --> 02:19.312
Today's the day.

02:31.559 --> 02:33.360
Don't tell me
you're not excited.

02:33.428 --> 02:37.063
Right now, my king, I'm more
focused on the matter at hand.

02:49.243 --> 02:50.844
Unh!

02:54.282 --> 02:55.515
Well?

02:55.583 --> 02:57.150
Yes, I'm excited.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.052
Today's the day.

03:06.594 --> 03:08.662
Stealing ice? Seriously?

03:08.729 --> 03:13.433
Isn't that a bit cliche
even for Captain Cold?

03:13.501 --> 03:16.436
Come on. We don't
have time for this!

03:23.311 --> 03:25.779
Err!

03:25.847 --> 03:27.180
Calm down, kid.

03:27.248 --> 03:28.715
Oh, please!

03:28.783 --> 03:30.684
You'll chat it up with
the cops, with bystanders,

03:30.751 --> 03:32.152
With cold even.

03:32.220 --> 03:33.987
No. No way!

03:34.055 --> 03:35.989
Today is the day!

03:56.577 --> 03:57.644
Today is the day.

03:57.712 --> 03:59.546
Welcome to the
hall of justice.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.648
Headquarters of
the Justice League.

04:01.716 --> 04:03.483
Oh, man!

04:05.186 --> 04:07.420
I knew we'd be the
last ones here.

04:10.558 --> 04:12.292
Is that Batman?

04:12.360 --> 04:13.994
I see Flash and Flash jr.

04:14.061 --> 04:15.328
His name's Speedy. Duh.

04:15.396 --> 04:17.264
No. Speedy's
green arrow's sidekick.

04:17.331 --> 04:19.699
Well, that makes no sense.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.334
Ready to see
the inner sanctum?

04:21.402 --> 04:22.602
Born that way.

04:22.670 --> 04:24.104
- I'm glad we're all here.

04:24.171 --> 04:26.172
- Have all 4 sidekicks
ever been in the same place

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
At the same time?

04:27.308 --> 04:30.677
- Don't call us
sidekicks, not after today.

04:30.745 --> 04:33.413
- Sorry. First
time at the hall.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.081
I'm a little overwhelmed.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.150
- You're overwhelmed,
freeze was underwhelmed.

04:37.218 --> 04:40.020
Why isn't anyone
ever just whelmed?

04:45.459 --> 04:47.794
Oh. Maybe that's why.

04:53.034 --> 04:59.034
- Robin, Speedy, Aqualad,
Kid Flash, welcome.

05:00.274 --> 05:03.944
You now have unlimited access
to the gym, our fully stocked

05:04.011 --> 05:08.348
Galley, and of
course our library.

05:08.416 --> 05:14.020
- Make yourselves at home.

05:14.088 --> 05:17.257
- Quick debrief to discuss the
coincidence of 4 ice villains

05:17.325 --> 05:19.359
Attacking on the same day.

05:19.427 --> 05:21.361
We shouldn't be long.

05:24.732 --> 05:32.405
- Recognized: Batman, 0-2;
Aquaman, 0-6; Flash, 0-4;

05:32.473 --> 05:37.277
Green Arrow, 0-8;
Martian Manhunter, 0-7;

05:37.345 --> 05:40.246
Red Tornado, 1-6.

05:40.314 --> 05:42.182
- That's it?

05:42.249 --> 05:44.818
You promised us a real look
inside, not a glorified

05:44.885 --> 05:46.386
Backstage pass.

05:46.454 --> 05:47.854
- It's a first step.

05:47.922 --> 05:50.190
You've been granted
access few others get.

05:50.257 --> 05:52.325
- Oh, really?

05:52.393 --> 05:54.694
Who cares which side of
the glass we're on?

05:54.762 --> 05:57.097
- Roy, you just need
to be patient.

05:57.164 --> 05:59.633
- What I need is respect.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.301
They're treating us like kids.

06:01.369 --> 06:03.703
Worse--like sidekicks!

06:03.771 --> 06:06.072
We deserve better than this.

06:08.342 --> 06:09.609
You're kidding, right?

06:09.677 --> 06:11.044
You're playing their game?

06:11.112 --> 06:13.747
Why? Because you
think they play fair?

06:13.814 --> 06:17.517
Today was supposed to be the
day, step one in becoming

06:17.585 --> 06:19.686
Full-fledged members
of The League.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.890
- Well, sure, but I thought
step one was a tour of the hq.

06:23.958 --> 06:26.726
- Except the hall isn't
The League's real hq.

06:26.794 --> 06:28.762
I bet they never told you
it's just a false front

06:28.829 --> 06:31.498
For tourists and a pit stop
for catching zeta beam

06:31.565 --> 06:35.535
Teleporter tubes to the real
thing, an orbiting satellite

06:35.603 --> 06:37.904
Called the watchtower.

06:39.907 --> 06:42.342
- I know, I know, but I
thought maybe we could make

06:42.410 --> 06:44.277
An exception.

06:46.981 --> 06:48.181
Or not.

06:48.249 --> 06:50.583
- You're not helping
your cause here, son.

06:50.651 --> 06:52.218
Stand down or--

06:52.286 --> 06:53.987
- Or what? You'll send
me to my room?

06:54.055 --> 06:55.689
And I'm not your son!

06:55.756 --> 06:57.357
I'm not even his.

06:57.425 --> 07:01.995
I thought I was his
partner, but not anymore.

07:08.769 --> 07:11.938
Guess they're
right about you 3.

07:12.006 --> 07:13.940
You're not ready.

07:20.748 --> 07:22.048
- Superman to Justice League.

07:22.116 --> 07:24.117
There's been an explosion
at project Cadmus.

07:24.185 --> 07:25.218
It's on fire.

07:25.286 --> 07:27.687
- I've had my
suspicions about Cadmus.

07:27.755 --> 07:29.756
This may present the
perfect opportunity to in--

07:29.824 --> 07:31.324
- Zatara to Justice League.

07:31.392 --> 07:34.327
The sorcerer wotan is using
the amulet of attan to blot

07:34.395 --> 07:35.395
Out the sun.

07:35.463 --> 07:37.263
Requesting full
League response.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.298
- Superman?

07:38.365 --> 07:39.566
- It's a small fire.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.267
Local authorities have
it under control.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.403
- Then Cadmus can wait.

07:43.471 --> 07:45.238
All leaguers rendezvous
at Zatara's coordinates.

07:45.306 --> 07:47.674
Batman out.

07:47.742 --> 07:48.808
Stay put.

07:48.876 --> 07:50.310
- What? Why?

07:50.377 --> 07:51.845
- This is a League mission.

07:51.912 --> 07:54.047
- You're not trained.
- Since when?

07:54.115 --> 07:56.049
- I meant you're not trained
to work as part of this team.

07:56.117 --> 07:58.852
- There will be other
missions when you're ready.

07:58.919 --> 08:02.255
- But for now, stay put.

08:04.892 --> 08:06.593
- Glad you didn't
bring you know who?

08:06.660 --> 08:08.261
- Indeed.

08:19.173 --> 08:20.874
- When we're ready?

08:20.941 --> 08:23.810
How are we ever supposed to be
ready when they treat us like--

08:23.878 --> 08:26.713
Like sidekicks?

08:26.781 --> 08:30.750
- My mentor, my king, I
thought he trusted me.

08:30.818 --> 08:33.352
- Trust? They don't even
trust us with the basics!

08:33.419 --> 08:37.090
They've got a
secret hq in space!

08:37.158 --> 08:39.159
- What else aren't
they telling us?

08:39.226 --> 08:40.960
- I have a better question.

08:41.028 --> 08:43.263
Why didn't we
leave with Speedy?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.502
- What is project Cadmus?

08:49.570 --> 08:52.772
- Don't know,
but I can find out.

08:56.610 --> 08:58.144
- Access denied.

08:58.212 --> 09:00.146
- Heh. Want to bet?

09:02.783 --> 09:05.151
- Whoa! How are
you doing that?

09:05.219 --> 09:08.221
- Same system as the batcave.

09:08.289 --> 09:11.791
- Access granted.

09:11.859 --> 09:13.326
- All right. Project Cadmus.

09:13.394 --> 09:15.695
Genetics lab here in d.C.

09:15.763 --> 09:19.332
That's all there is, but if
Batman's suspicious, maybe we

09:19.400 --> 09:20.600
Should investigate.

09:20.668 --> 09:22.869
- Solve their case
before they do.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.470
It would be poetic justice.

09:24.538 --> 09:27.507
- Hey. They're
all about justice.

09:27.575 --> 09:29.042
- But they said stay put.

09:29.109 --> 09:31.878
- For the blotting out the
sun mission, not this.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.546
- Wait. Are you
going to Cadmus?

09:33.614 --> 09:37.050
Because if you're
going, I'm going.

09:37.117 --> 09:40.053
- Just like that we're
a team on a mission?

09:40.120 --> 09:42.088
- We didn't come for
a play date.

09:50.030 --> 09:51.998
- Help!
- Get us down!

09:52.066 --> 09:55.268
- Stay put.
We will get you out.

10:02.309 --> 10:05.178
- Ohh, ohh!

10:05.246 --> 10:07.747
- It's what's his
name--Flash boy!

10:07.815 --> 10:10.350
- Kid Flash! Why
is that so hard?

10:10.417 --> 10:12.018
- So smooth.

10:12.086 --> 10:13.887
- Does he always have
to run ahead?

10:13.954 --> 10:15.021
We need a plan.

10:15.089 --> 10:16.890
We--Robin?

10:16.957 --> 10:18.858
- Ha ha ha!

10:26.100 --> 10:27.867
- I need to borrow that.

10:34.608 --> 10:37.543
Step aboard now.

10:37.611 --> 10:39.112
- Ohh!

10:48.889 --> 10:50.156
- Appreciate the help.

10:50.224 --> 10:51.257
- You handled it.

10:51.325 --> 10:53.293
Besides, we're here
to investigate.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.096
Poetic justice, remember?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.037
- There was something
in the--

11:04.104 --> 11:05.872
- Elevators should
be locked down.

11:11.111 --> 11:12.679
- This is wrong.

11:15.382 --> 11:16.549
Thought so.

11:16.617 --> 11:18.751
This is a high-speed
express elevator.

11:18.819 --> 11:20.887
It doesn't belong in a
two-story building.

11:20.955 --> 11:23.356
- Neither does what I saw.

11:23.424 --> 11:25.124
Unh!

11:28.662 --> 11:31.331
- And that's why they need
an express elevator.

11:48.048 --> 11:49.949
I'm at the end of my rope.

11:56.323 --> 11:59.058
Bypassing security.

11:59.126 --> 12:01.027
There! Go!

12:03.998 --> 12:06.065
Welcome to project Cadmus.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.005
- Wait!

12:12.072 --> 12:13.539
- Aah!

12:18.779 --> 12:20.480
Ohh.

12:32.860 --> 12:36.429
- No. Nothing odd
going on here.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.358
- Dr. Desmond.

13:05.426 --> 13:08.061
- Tell me, guardian, what part
of no interruptions did you

13:08.128 --> 13:11.664
Not understand?

13:11.732 --> 13:14.467
If you're here to tell me what
caused the street level fire,

13:14.535 --> 13:15.635
It can wait.

13:15.702 --> 13:17.537
- Fire department's
still cleaning up.

13:17.604 --> 13:19.539
I'll begin my
investigation when they leave.

13:19.606 --> 13:20.740
- Then what?

13:20.808 --> 13:23.843
- A g-gnome on sub-level
26 reports 3 intruders.

13:23.911 --> 13:28.081
- Ohh. Did I miss a
perimeter breach alert?

13:28.148 --> 13:29.048
- No.

13:29.116 --> 13:30.650
- Then the g-gnome's confused.

13:30.717 --> 13:33.286
Whatever might occur in our
faux lab above ground,

13:33.353 --> 13:38.157
The real Cadmus is the most
secure facility in d.C.

13:38.225 --> 13:40.226
- My job to keep it that way.

13:40.294 --> 13:43.596
- Fine. Take a squad.

13:43.664 --> 13:47.300
- Might I recommend guardian
leave his g-gnome behind?

13:47.367 --> 13:49.769
If violence should occur...

13:49.837 --> 13:51.504
- The little guy would
be in my way.

13:51.572 --> 13:55.441
- No. The advantage of instant
telepathic communication

13:55.509 --> 13:59.145
Outweighs other concerns.

14:03.450 --> 14:06.686
- I need my g-gnome with
me at all times.

14:18.866 --> 14:21.734
- Ok. I'm officially whelmed.

14:30.177 --> 14:32.812
- This is how they hid this
massive underground facility

14:32.880 --> 14:34.480
From the world.

14:34.548 --> 14:36.449
The real Cadmus
isn't on the grid.

14:36.517 --> 14:40.219
It generates its own
power with these things.

14:40.287 --> 14:42.288
Must be what they're bred for.

14:42.356 --> 14:44.557
- Of course. Even the
name is a clue.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.827
The Cadmus of myth created a
new race by sowing dragons'

14:47.895 --> 14:49.162
Teeth into the earth.

14:49.229 --> 14:53.232
- And this Cadmus
creates new life, too.

14:53.300 --> 14:55.301
Let's find out why.

14:57.571 --> 14:59.672
They call them genomorphs.

14:59.740 --> 15:03.276
Whoa! Look at the stats on
these things--superstrength,

15:03.343 --> 15:04.544
Telepathy, razor claws.

15:04.611 --> 15:06.245
These are living weapons!

15:06.313 --> 15:09.482
- They're engineering
an army, but for who?

15:09.550 --> 15:10.816
- Wait. There's
something else.

15:10.884 --> 15:13.052
Project Kr.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.354
Ugh! The file's
triple-encrypted. I can't--

15:15.422 --> 15:16.689
- Don't move!

15:19.159 --> 15:23.162
Wait. Robin,
Aqualad, Kid Flash?

15:23.230 --> 15:25.898
- At least he got
your name right.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.099
- I know you.

15:27.167 --> 15:28.968
Guardian, a hero.

15:29.036 --> 15:30.236
- I do my best.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.404
- Then what are
you doing here?

15:31.471 --> 15:33.272
- I think that's
my question, boys.

15:33.340 --> 15:34.740
I'm chief of security.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.310
You're trespassing, but we
can call the Justice League,

15:37.377 --> 15:38.578
Figure this out.

15:38.645 --> 15:40.046
- You think The League's
gonna approve of you

15:40.113 --> 15:41.314
Breeding weapons?

15:41.381 --> 15:47.381
- Weapons? What are
you--what have I--ugh.

15:47.487 --> 15:50.356
My head.

15:50.424 --> 15:51.958
Take them down hard!

15:52.025 --> 15:53.025
No mercy!

16:34.701 --> 16:36.335
- Way to be a
team player, rob!

16:36.403 --> 16:38.104
- Weren't you right behind me?

16:49.383 --> 16:50.516
- We're headed down?

16:50.584 --> 16:52.218
- Dude, out is up.

16:52.286 --> 16:56.589
- Excuse me? Project Kr,
it's down on sub-level 52.

16:56.657 --> 16:59.058
- This is out of control.

16:59.126 --> 17:05.126
Perhaps--perhaps we
should contact The League.

17:14.775 --> 17:17.376
- We are already here.

17:23.550 --> 17:24.784
Which way?

17:24.851 --> 17:26.484
- Yeah. Bizarre-looking
hallway one

17:26.553 --> 17:28.421
Or bizarre-looking hallway two?

17:28.488 --> 17:29.922
- Halt!

17:43.003 --> 17:45.404
They are headed
for project Kr!

17:54.648 --> 17:56.382
- Aah!

18:05.492 --> 18:07.093
Hurry!

18:17.504 --> 18:18.637
- I disabled the door.

18:18.705 --> 18:19.672
We're safe.

18:19.740 --> 18:20.873
- We're trapped.

18:20.941 --> 18:23.976
- Uh, guys. You'll
want to see this.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.351
- Whoa!

18:46.000 --> 18:50.537
- Big "k," little "r," the
atomic symbol for krypton.

18:50.605 --> 18:51.571
Clone?

18:51.639 --> 18:52.672
- Robin, hack.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.474
- Oh. Right, right.

19:00.848 --> 19:04.818
Weapon designation Superboy,
a clone force-grown

19:04.885 --> 19:06.386
In...16 weeks?

19:06.454 --> 19:08.421
From DNA acquired
from Superman.

19:08.489 --> 19:10.090
- Stolen from Superman.

19:10.157 --> 19:12.058
- No way the big guy
knows about this.

19:12.126 --> 19:14.160
- Solar suit allows him
to absorb yellow sun

19:14.228 --> 19:15.996
Radiation 24/7.

19:16.063 --> 19:18.365
- And these creatures?

19:18.432 --> 19:21.801
- Genomorph gnomes,
telepathic, force-feeding him

19:21.869 --> 19:23.169
An education.

19:23.237 --> 19:24.437
- And we can guess what else.

19:24.505 --> 19:30.043
They're making a slave out
of, well, Superman's son.

19:30.111 --> 19:32.145
- Now we contact The League.

19:34.949 --> 19:35.915
- No signal.

19:35.983 --> 19:38.485
- We're in too deep literally.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.525
- They're still in
there with the weapon?

19:45.593 --> 19:47.193
- We can't get the door open.

19:47.261 --> 19:49.062
- Use your telekinesis!

19:49.130 --> 19:51.464
- I have tried to no avail.

19:51.532 --> 19:53.700
- Useless. This is a debacle.

19:53.768 --> 19:56.836
Get some g-trolls down here
to muscle the door open now!

19:56.904 --> 19:58.705
- Already on their way.

19:58.773 --> 20:01.274
- You realize once we get
in there we can't ever let

20:01.342 --> 20:02.475
Them leave.

20:02.543 --> 20:05.779
- Doc, these aren't your
typical meddling kids.

20:05.846 --> 20:07.314
You don't want to get on
the wrong side

20:07.381 --> 20:08.782
Of the Justice League.

20:08.849 --> 20:10.817
- Better than getting on the
wrong since of the Cadmus

20:10.885 --> 20:13.119
Board of directors, believe me.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.291
Contact the
g-gnomes inside Kr.

20:22.863 --> 20:23.963
- This is wrong.

20:24.031 --> 20:26.066
- We can't leave
him like this.

20:26.133 --> 20:28.568
- Set him free. Do it.

20:45.486 --> 20:47.220
Unh!

20:50.324 --> 20:52.092
- Whoa! Hang on, Supey.

20:52.159 --> 20:54.361
- We're on your side.

20:54.428 --> 20:55.929
- Ohh!

20:58.165 --> 20:59.866
- I don't want to do this.

21:01.168 --> 21:02.569
Unh!

21:17.284 --> 21:20.186
- Enough!

21:28.028 --> 21:29.896
- We are trying to help you.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.843
- Aah!

22:10.070 --> 22:11.905
- Attaboy.

22:34.296 --> 22:38.133
- Dr. Desmond, you require
an audience with the light?

22:38.168 --> 22:41.970
- Yes. Very sorry to disturb
you at this late hour.

22:42.037 --> 22:43.404
- Just make your report.

22:43.472 --> 22:45.773
- Of course. Ahem.

22:45.841 --> 22:49.877
Well, we had a small fire
here at project Cadmus.

22:49.945 --> 22:52.780
The origin of the incident is
still unclear, but it seems to

22:52.848 --> 22:55.149
Have attracted some...

22:55.217 --> 22:57.485
Unwanted attention.

22:57.553 --> 23:02.023
3 sidekicks--Robin,
Aqualad, and Kid Flash--

23:02.091 --> 23:03.691
Breached security.

23:03.759 --> 23:07.462
They found and released
the weapon, the Superboy.

23:07.529 --> 23:10.732
Of course the clone is under
our telepathic control and as

23:10.799 --> 23:13.768
Ordered turned against
his would-be liberators.

23:13.836 --> 23:16.371
The 3 are contained, and we
don't believe The League knows

23:16.438 --> 23:18.506
They're here.

23:18.574 --> 23:23.978
Uh, what should I
do with them?

23:24.046 --> 23:25.446
- Clone them.

23:25.514 --> 23:29.717
The substitutes will serve
the light and only the light.

23:29.785 --> 23:33.054
- And the originals?

23:33.122 --> 23:34.622
- Dispose of them.

23:34.690 --> 23:36.391
Leave no trace.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.667
- Time runs short.

23:46.735 --> 23:48.936
You must awaken.

23:49.004 --> 23:51.439
You must awaken now!

23:55.844 --> 23:59.447
- What? What do you want?

23:59.515 --> 24:01.949
Quit staring.
You're creeping me out.

24:02.017 --> 24:05.019
- Uh, KF, how about we not
tick off the guy who can fry

24:05.087 --> 24:06.654
Us with a look?

24:06.722 --> 24:09.123
- Prepare the cloning
procedure for the new project

24:09.191 --> 24:12.760
Sidekick now.

24:12.828 --> 24:14.495
- Almost done here, doc.

24:20.335 --> 24:21.969
- Where's the weapon?

24:22.037 --> 24:23.971
- Superboy? He carried
the intruders to

24:24.039 --> 24:25.073
The cloning chamber.

24:25.140 --> 24:26.974
- We have genomorphs for that!

24:27.042 --> 24:29.410
Get the weapon back
in its pod now!

24:29.478 --> 24:30.912
- I don't see the harm
in letting the kid

24:30.979 --> 24:32.213
Stretch his legs.

24:32.281 --> 24:34.015
- Don't you now?

24:38.787 --> 24:41.489
- That clone
belongs in a cage!

24:46.562 --> 24:48.029
- We only sought to help you.

24:48.097 --> 24:49.897
- Yeah. We free you,
and you turn on us.

24:49.965 --> 24:50.965
How's that for grat--

24:51.033 --> 24:53.201
- Kid, please, be quiet now.

24:53.268 --> 24:56.070
I believe our new friend
is not in full control

24:56.138 --> 24:57.872
Of his actions.

24:57.940 --> 25:03.277
- Wha--what if--
what if I wasn't?

25:03.345 --> 25:05.146
- He can talk?

25:05.214 --> 25:09.283
- Yes, he can.

25:09.351 --> 25:11.252
- Not like I said, "it."

25:11.320 --> 25:13.554
- The genomorphs taught
you telepathically.

25:13.622 --> 25:15.423
- They taught me much.

25:15.491 --> 25:17.859
I can read, write.

25:17.926 --> 25:19.360
I know the names of things.

25:19.428 --> 25:20.962
- But have you seen them?

25:21.029 --> 25:25.933
Have they ever actually let
you see the sky or the sun?

25:26.001 --> 25:30.738
- Images are implanted
in my mind, but no.

25:30.806 --> 25:32.306
I have not seen them.

25:32.374 --> 25:34.876
- Do you know what
you are, who you are?

25:34.943 --> 25:38.112
- I am the Superboy, a
genomorph, a clone made from

25:38.180 --> 25:41.182
The DNA of the Superman,
created to replace him should

25:41.250 --> 25:46.621
He perish, to destroy him
should he turn from the light.

25:46.688 --> 25:50.558
- To be like Superman is a
worthy aspiration, but like

25:50.626 --> 25:54.262
Superman, you deserve a life
of your own beyond that

25:54.329 --> 25:58.866
Solar suit, beyond your
pod, beyond Cadmus.

25:58.934 --> 26:00.968
- I live because of Cadmus!

26:01.036 --> 26:02.136
It is my home!

26:02.204 --> 26:03.971
- Your home is a test tube.

26:04.039 --> 26:05.773
We can show you the sun.

26:05.841 --> 26:08.709
- Uh, pretty sure it's after
midnight, but we can show

26:08.777 --> 26:09.877
You the moon.

26:09.945 --> 26:14.615
- We can show you,
introduce you to Superman.

26:14.683 --> 26:17.685
- No, they can't.

26:17.753 --> 26:20.688
They'll be otherwise occupied.

26:20.756 --> 26:22.456
Activate the cloning process.

26:22.524 --> 26:24.759
- Pass. Batcave's
crowded enough.

26:24.826 --> 26:28.095
- And get the weapon
back in its pod!

26:28.163 --> 26:30.831
- Hey. How come he gets
to call Supey an it?

26:33.435 --> 26:36.971
- Help us.

26:37.039 --> 26:40.007
- Don't start thinking now.

26:43.011 --> 26:45.012
See, you're not a real boy.

26:45.080 --> 26:49.016
You're a weapon, and
you belong to me!

26:49.084 --> 26:51.485
Well, to Cadmus. Same thing.

26:51.553 --> 26:53.621
Now get back to your pod!

27:06.268 --> 27:09.103
- Aah!
- Unh!

27:16.178 --> 27:17.445
- Where's dubbilex?

27:17.512 --> 27:21.015
Ooh! Lurking as usual.

27:21.083 --> 27:23.684
Get the g-gnomes
downloading their memories.

27:23.752 --> 27:26.287
When that's done and when
you're sure the clones are

27:26.355 --> 27:30.491
Viable, delete the
source material.

27:38.867 --> 27:43.104
- Superboy, you live.

27:43.171 --> 27:45.906
That gives you the right
to follow your own path.

27:45.974 --> 27:51.212
A weapon or a person, the
choice is yours, but ask

27:51.280 --> 27:54.548
Yourself, "what
would Superman do?"

28:11.867 --> 28:13.901
- I told you to get
back to your--

28:17.739 --> 28:19.840
- Don't give me orders.

28:22.878 --> 28:24.979
- You here to help
us or fry us?

28:27.182 --> 28:30.418
- Huh. I don't seem to have
heat vision, so I suppose

28:30.485 --> 28:32.687
Helping is my only option.

28:36.591 --> 28:37.958
- Ahh. Finally!

28:38.026 --> 28:39.593
Lucky Batman isn't here.

28:39.661 --> 28:41.495
He'd have my head
for taking so long.

28:41.563 --> 28:44.098
- Seriously, that's what
you're worried about?

28:44.166 --> 28:47.034
The whole League will have
our heads after tonight.

28:49.171 --> 28:50.104
- Free Aqualad.

28:50.172 --> 28:51.572
I'll get kid mouth.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.208
- Don't you give
me orders either.

28:57.145 --> 28:58.579
- Thank you.

29:03.151 --> 29:05.286
- You--you'll never
get out of here!

29:05.354 --> 29:07.855
I'll have you back in
pods before morning.

29:07.923 --> 29:10.925
- That guy is not whelmed,
not whelmed at all.

29:10.992 --> 29:12.960
- What is it with you
and this whelmed thing?

29:19.701 --> 29:25.506
- Activate every
genomorph in Cadmus.

29:32.681 --> 29:34.949
- We are still 42 levels
below ground, but if we can

29:35.016 --> 29:36.917
Make the elevator...

29:56.088 --> 29:57.489
- Aah!

30:08.000 --> 30:10.969
- Superboy, the goal
is escape, not to bury

30:11.037 --> 30:12.237
Ourselves here.

30:12.305 --> 30:14.773
- You want escape?

30:14.840 --> 30:16.741
Aah!

30:29.055 --> 30:31.022
I--I'm falling.

30:34.927 --> 30:37.228
Superman can fly.

30:37.296 --> 30:38.596
Why can't I fly?

30:38.664 --> 30:40.265
- Don't know, but it looks
like you can leap tall

30:40.333 --> 30:41.633
Buildings in a single bound.

30:41.701 --> 30:44.669
Still cool.

30:44.737 --> 30:45.870
- Thank you.

30:45.938 --> 30:48.373
- Guys, this will have
to be our exit.

30:57.817 --> 30:59.451
- Turn left, brother.

31:01.487 --> 31:04.222
- Go left! Left!

31:04.290 --> 31:05.390
- Turn right.

31:05.458 --> 31:06.992
- Right!

31:09.862 --> 31:11.129
- Great directions, Supey.

31:11.197 --> 31:12.697
You trying to get us repodded?

31:12.765 --> 31:14.799
- No. I don't understand.

31:14.867 --> 31:18.069
- Don't apologize.
This is perfect!

31:23.009 --> 31:24.642
- At this rate,
we'll never get out.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.545
- Shh. Listen.

31:31.417 --> 31:34.419
- Someone--Robin, I'd
wager--hacked our systems,

31:34.487 --> 31:38.223
Deactivating internal security
cameras, but he neglected

31:38.290 --> 31:39.891
The motion sensors.

31:39.959 --> 31:42.794
The genomorphs are closing in.

31:42.862 --> 31:44.496
They're all
coming out in here.

31:44.563 --> 31:46.197
We have them cornered.

31:54.206 --> 31:58.510
Ohh! He hacked the
motion sensors.

31:58.577 --> 32:00.011
- I hacked the motion sensors.

32:00.079 --> 32:02.881
- Sweet. Still plenty of
them between us and out.

32:02.948 --> 32:05.050
- But I've finally
got room to move.

32:13.993 --> 32:15.860
- More behind us.

32:22.802 --> 32:24.836
- We'll cut them off
at sub-level 1.

32:24.904 --> 32:29.904
- We'd better, or the board
will have our heads, my head.

32:31.944 --> 32:34.579
I need to get something
from project Blockbuster

32:34.647 --> 32:35.747
Just in case.

32:35.815 --> 32:37.749
I'll meet you at sub-level 1.

32:42.488 --> 32:43.822
- Oh, crud.

32:46.592 --> 32:48.393
- We're cut off
from the street.

32:48.461 --> 32:50.862
- Thanks. My head
hadn noticed.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.334
- Can't hack this fast enough.

32:58.337 --> 32:59.904
This way!

33:24.430 --> 33:26.865
- Perhaps for the sake of
all genomorphs, our brother

33:26.932 --> 33:31.069
Superboy should make
up his own mind.

33:31.137 --> 33:32.337
- It was you.

33:32.404 --> 33:35.840
- Yes, brother. I set the fire
and lured your new friends

33:35.908 --> 33:39.544
Down into Cadmus, woke them
when they were in danger...

33:39.612 --> 33:41.913
- And guided me. Why?

33:41.981 --> 33:46.484
- Because you are our
hope, the genomorph hero.

33:46.552 --> 33:50.255
You will blaze a trail for all
our brothers, showing us

33:50.322 --> 33:53.491
The way to freedom.

33:53.559 --> 33:55.627
- What's going on?

34:00.733 --> 34:04.802
- What is your
choice, brother?

34:04.870 --> 34:08.706
- I...Choose...Freedom.

34:11.543 --> 34:16.380
- Feels like fog lifting.

34:16.447 --> 34:18.416
- Guardian?

34:18.484 --> 34:21.119
- Go. I'll deal with Desmond.

34:21.187 --> 34:24.489
- I think not.

34:24.556 --> 34:28.893
Project Blockbuster will give
me the power to restore order

34:28.960 --> 34:30.762
To Cadmus.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.300
- Everyone back!

35:10.370 --> 35:12.871
Aah!

35:12.939 --> 35:14.406
- Arrgh!

35:27.320 --> 35:29.955
- Ok. That's one way to
bust through the ceiling.

35:30.023 --> 35:31.623
- You think lab
coat planned that?

35:31.691 --> 35:35.160
- I doubt he is planning
anything anymore.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.821
- Learned that one
in kindergarten.

36:18.238 --> 36:19.738
- Unh!

36:29.983 --> 36:30.949
- Aah!

36:31.017 --> 36:32.418
- Unh!

36:39.492 --> 36:42.194
- Of course.

36:42.262 --> 36:44.229
KF, get over here!

36:58.244 --> 36:59.611
- Got it?
- Got it.

36:59.679 --> 37:01.013
- Go!

37:06.853 --> 37:08.554
- Got your nose.

37:15.095 --> 37:17.930
- Superboy, Aqualad!

37:17.997 --> 37:21.600
- Come and get me,
you incredible bulk!

37:21.668 --> 37:23.068
Ohh!

37:26.506 --> 37:28.373
- This one and that one.

37:33.046 --> 37:34.880
- Sorry. Try again.

37:50.797 --> 37:53.432
- Ha!

37:56.936 --> 37:58.737
- Move!

38:37.777 --> 38:40.445
- We did it.

38:40.513 --> 38:42.981
- Was there ever any doubt?

38:53.026 --> 38:56.762
- See? The moon.

39:07.740 --> 39:10.075
Oh. And Superman.

39:10.143 --> 39:12.244
Do we keep our
promises or what?

39:58.424 --> 40:01.326
- Is that what I think it is?

40:01.394 --> 40:03.595
- He doesn't like
being called an it.

40:03.663 --> 40:05.631
- I'm Superman's clone.

40:13.039 --> 40:14.940
- Start talking.

40:37.030 --> 40:39.831
Well, uh--we'll figure
something out for you.

40:39.899 --> 40:41.600
The League will, I mean.

40:41.668 --> 40:46.038
For now, I'd better make sure
they get that Blockbuster

40:46.105 --> 40:50.409
Creature squared away.

40:50.476 --> 40:54.980
- Cadmus will be investigated,
all 52 levels, but let's make

40:55.048 --> 40:56.214
One thing clear.

40:56.282 --> 40:57.616
- You should have called.

40:57.684 --> 41:00.319
- End results aside,
we are not happy.

41:00.386 --> 41:03.021
You hacked Justice League
systems, disobeyed direct

41:03.089 --> 41:05.857
Orders, and endangered lives.

41:05.925 --> 41:10.195
You will not be
doing this again.

41:10.263 --> 41:13.098
- I am sorry, but we will.

41:13.166 --> 41:15.834
- Aqualad, stand down.

41:15.902 --> 41:20.272
- Apologies, my king, but no.

41:20.340 --> 41:24.343
We did good work here tonight,
the work you trained us to do.

41:24.410 --> 41:29.715
Together on our own we forged
something powerful, important.

41:29.782 --> 41:31.516
- If this is about your
treatment at the hall,

41:31.584 --> 41:32.484
The 3 of you--

41:32.552 --> 41:34.252
- The 4 of us, and it's not.

41:34.320 --> 41:37.856
- Batman, we're ready to use
what you taught us, or why

41:37.924 --> 41:41.660
Teach us at all?

41:41.728 --> 41:44.096
- Why let them tell
us what to do?

41:44.163 --> 41:45.664
It's simple.

41:45.732 --> 41:48.900
Get on board or get
out of the way.

42:03.649 --> 42:05.884
- This cave was the
original secret sanctuary

42:05.952 --> 42:08.053
Of the Justice League.

42:08.121 --> 42:10.222
We're calling it
into service again.

42:10.289 --> 42:12.824
Since you 4 are determined
to stay together and fight

42:12.892 --> 42:17.729
The good fight, you'll do
it on League terms.

42:17.797 --> 42:19.898
Red Tornado volunteered
to live here and be

42:19.966 --> 42:21.233
Your supervisor.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.602
Black canary's in
charge of training.

42:23.669 --> 42:25.871
I will deploy you on missions.

42:25.938 --> 42:27.406
- Real missions?

42:27.473 --> 42:29.708
- Yes, but covert.

42:29.776 --> 42:31.910
- The League will still
handle the obvious stuff.

42:31.978 --> 42:34.880
There's a reason we have these
big targets on our chests.

42:34.947 --> 42:37.649
- But Cadmus proves the bad
guys are getting smarter.

42:37.717 --> 42:40.285
Batman needs a team that
can operate on the sly.

42:40.353 --> 42:42.454
- The 5 of you will
be that team.

42:42.522 --> 42:46.958
- Cool! Wait. 5?

42:47.026 --> 42:49.528
- This is the Martian
Manhunter's niece

42:49.595 --> 42:50.796
Miss Martian.

42:50.863 --> 42:52.397
- Hi.

42:52.465 --> 42:54.966
- Liking this gig
more every minute.

42:55.034 --> 42:57.602
Welcome aboard. I'm Kid Flash.

42:57.670 --> 42:58.904
That's Robin, Aqualad.

42:58.971 --> 43:00.572
It's cool if you
forget their names.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.908
- I'm honored to be included.

43:07.580 --> 43:10.415
- Hey, Superboy.
Come meet miss M.

43:14.787 --> 43:16.922
- I like your t-shirt.

43:22.261 --> 43:24.062
- Today is the day.

43:32.371 --> 43:35.173
- Cadmus changes today.

43:35.241 --> 43:37.476
With Desmond out of the
picture, the board's placed me

43:37.543 --> 43:38.510
In charge.

43:38.578 --> 43:40.712
Dr. Spence, you're
acting chief scientist.

43:40.780 --> 43:43.281
No more g-gnomes suppressing
our wills, no more secret

43:43.349 --> 43:44.683
Breeding projects.

43:44.750 --> 43:48.520
This is a kinder,
gentler Cadmus.

43:48.588 --> 43:53.959
- Then I will of course help
in any way I can, brother.

43:54.026 --> 43:56.261
- Can the light afford to
leave guardian in charge

43:56.329 --> 43:58.330
Without the g-gnomes?

43:58.397 --> 44:01.333
- We have subtler
means of control.

44:01.400 --> 44:05.003
What concerns me
is the children.

44:05.071 --> 44:07.072
We now know The League is
willing to employ young heroes

44:07.139 --> 44:09.307
To do their dirty work.

44:09.375 --> 44:10.775
That's a dark twist.

44:10.843 --> 44:14.746
- Yes, but one that can be
played to our advantage.

44:14.814 --> 44:19.384
Even the temporary loss of
the weapon may prove useful.

44:19.452 --> 44:23.955
Eventually everyone
sees the light.
