00:10.234 --> 00:15.823

00:15.823 --> 00:17.784
Got a few more
questions for you.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.327
-Are you arresting me?
-Nope.

00:19.327 --> 00:21.079
So then why am I here?

00:21.079 --> 00:23.664
I was only doing what
that cop Miguel made me do.

00:23.664 --> 00:25.375
We had to bring you
in like everyone else

00:25.375 --> 00:27.502
to keep from
blowing your cover.

00:27.502 --> 00:29.796
So can I go?

00:29.796 --> 00:32.507
Miguel's got lots of
complaints against him.

00:32.507 --> 00:35.426
Big surprise.

00:35.426 --> 00:41.015
Did you know Miguel's
last two CIs went missing?

00:41.015 --> 00:44.811

he worked with died.

Yeah, she went to East Los.

01:14.507 --> 01:17.885
and allegations
of corruption.

01:17.885 --> 01:19.720
That's where you come in.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.514
You want to
use me as bait?

01:21.514 --> 01:22.974
We only need evidence.

01:22.974 --> 01:26.227

It's a little sloppy.

02:51.354 --> 02:52.480
It needs a lot of work.

02:52.480 --> 02:56.567
Hey, Ceci, why aren't
you choreographing this?

02:56.567 --> 02:58.486
I can't, if the Bomb Squad

02:58.486 --> 02:59.820
gets paid for outside gigs,

02:59.820 --> 03:02.323
we can't perform in
high school competitions.

03:02.323 --> 03:04.492
So you're on your
own for this one.

03:04.492 --> 03:08.621
-Gina, let me talk to you.
-Sure.

03:08.621 --> 03:11.290
You might want to tone the
sexy down in this routine.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.833
Have you seen the
Hatchett commercials?

03:12.833 --> 03:14.001
They're hella steamy.

03:14.001 --> 03:16.587
Look, I don't care,
that's not who we are

03:16.587 --> 03:17.880
or who you need to be.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.799
Okay, but it's like you said,
this isn't a Bomb Squad event

03:19.799 --> 03:22.093
so you don't have a say.

03:22.093 --> 03:23.261
Tone it down.

03:23.261 --> 03:27.598
I'll see you at
the bro event.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.350
Hey.

03:29.350 --> 03:30.685
Hey.

03:30.685 --> 03:33.229
So did you tell them about
your music video shoot?

03:33.229 --> 03:34.730
You mean how I got cut?

03:34.730 --> 03:37.191
Hell no, that's why I'm
heading this dance class.

03:37.191 --> 03:39.026
That shit ain't going
to happen again.

03:39.026 --> 03:41.696
Look at you,
you're a fighter.

03:41.696 --> 03:44.573
-I like that.
-Okay, we got to focus.

03:44.573 --> 03:46.867
You still got to pull
off this big launch party.

03:46.867 --> 03:49.537
I know, and I don't
want to screw it up.

03:49.537 --> 03:51.831
That's how I feel
about this master class.

03:51.831 --> 03:54.500
But all we got to
do is kick ass.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.836
Come on.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.171
All right, remember what we
talked about, let's start.

03:59.171 --> 04:02.216
And five, six,
seven, let's work.

04:02.216 --> 04:05.303
Nice, ladies.

04:05.303 --> 04:09.640
Keep pushing, I need
more energy, more energy.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.599
Actually, can I just see

04:10.599 --> 04:12.059
you two ladies
do it by yourself?

04:12.059 --> 04:13.894
I want to see it just
like it's an audition,

04:13.894 --> 04:15.104
full out, let's go.

04:15.104 --> 04:17.398
And five, six, seven, eight.

04:17.398 --> 04:18.691
Girl, I didn't
think you'd make it

04:18.691 --> 04:20.234
to the end of the routine.

04:20.234 --> 04:21.986
I'm not a quitter.

04:21.986 --> 04:23.904
Thank you for hooking me
up with this class though.

04:23.904 --> 04:26.824
You know, us backup bitches
got to stick together.

04:26.824 --> 04:29.702
Besides, I got a
two-for-one coupon.

04:29.702 --> 04:33.581
Wait, then why did
I pay full price?

04:33.581 --> 04:35.166
Okay, guys, that was great.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.460
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

04:37.460 --> 04:38.586
Hey, man, I can't believe

04:38.586 --> 04:39.920
I almost quit over
that Brandie chick.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.631
-So why didn't you?
-Because I want to be

04:41.631 --> 04:42.840
on a winning team.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.592
So can me and you put
our bullshit aside

04:44.592 --> 04:48.679
for Bomb Squad?

04:48.679 --> 04:54.268
All right, man.

04:54.268 --> 04:56.937
So, why would you deny

04:56.937 --> 04:58.731
voting for me to
stay on the team?

04:58.731 --> 05:00.691
-It's not adding up.
-I don't know.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.276
I'm not good at math.

05:02.276 --> 05:06.489
I can't believe
she's still here.

05:06.489 --> 05:08.866
Hey, Eddie.

05:08.866 --> 05:11.285
Hey, listen, so I
know it's a secret,

05:11.285 --> 05:13.371
but I just wanted
to say thank you.

05:13.371 --> 05:14.997
Thank you for what?

05:14.997 --> 05:15.998
You know.

05:15.998 --> 05:17.833
For voting to keep
me on the team.

05:17.833 --> 05:21.128
-Luis told you?
-No, but you just did.

05:21.128 --> 05:22.838
Oh, my God.

05:22.838 --> 05:25.132
Yes, you know I thought
it was just a hunch,

05:25.132 --> 05:26.634
but it's true!

05:26.634 --> 05:28.803
I knew you didn't hate me.

05:28.803 --> 05:29.845
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:29.845 --> 05:31.555
Get your crazy
ass off of me.

05:31.555 --> 05:33.057
Look, look, look.

05:33.057 --> 05:34.225
I'm still hating on you.

05:34.225 --> 05:39.897
Ah, but you're
hating Caleb more.

05:39.897 --> 05:41.816
Gina better not
find out about this.

05:41.816 --> 05:43.526
Don't even worry
about it, okay?

05:43.526 --> 05:45.486
I'm keeping things hush-hush.

05:45.486 --> 05:47.321
It's kind of my thing.

05:47.321 --> 05:50.658
So the catering is courtesy
of my dad's taqueria.

05:50.658 --> 05:53.119
You know, it's so you can
highlight the Latino angle

05:53.119 --> 05:55.204
on the Hatchett scents.

05:55.204 --> 05:57.665
Great, great, talk to
me about entertainment.

05:57.665 --> 05:59.333
The dance troupe, they're
called the Bomb Squad,

05:59.333 --> 06:00.459
you're going to love
these guys, they--

06:00.459 --> 06:01.836
Oh, hold on, what
do you mean "guys"?

06:01.836 --> 06:03.671
This place is going to be
a sausage fest already.

06:03.671 --> 06:05.339
-No, no guys.
-I'm kidding, man,

06:05.339 --> 06:07.049
I lied, they're girls.

06:07.049 --> 06:09.093
-Kidding, I'm kidding.
-Hey, look, Paulie's gone.

06:09.093 --> 06:10.928
This is all you
right now, all right?

06:10.928 --> 06:12.930
This party's got to be,

06:12.930 --> 06:14.682
how do your peeps say, "Hot"?

06:14.682 --> 06:16.058
-Caliente.
-Caliente,

06:16.058 --> 06:17.643
that's what I'm talking
about, look at me.

06:17.643 --> 06:20.187
I'm like bi-no-homo-lingual.

06:20.187 --> 06:21.480
Right!

06:21.480 --> 06:23.524
Speaking all sorts
of Spanish up in here.

06:23.524 --> 06:24.984
Right there, right there.

06:44.128 --> 06:45.337
Mm.

06:45.337 --> 06:46.714
Morning breath.

06:46.714 --> 06:50.718
Babe, morning wood.

06:50.718 --> 06:53.637
Is that seriously
all you think about?

06:53.637 --> 06:55.890
You're the only
thing I think about,

06:55.890 --> 06:58.225
morning, noon, and night.

06:58.225 --> 07:01.145
I wish we could spend
every night together.

07:01.145 --> 07:03.939
We can, until my mom and Hernan

07:03.939 --> 07:07.151
get back from their honeymoon.

07:07.151 --> 07:17.995
Well, let's not waste
any more time, huh?

07:17.995 --> 07:20.289
Yo, this new cook is great.

07:20.289 --> 07:22.291
They're going to love
this at the bro party.

07:22.291 --> 07:23.501
How are the new
servers doing?

07:23.501 --> 07:24.627
Fine, I guess.

07:24.627 --> 07:26.337
I'm not trying to
get to know them.

07:26.337 --> 07:27.963
Hey, what's up with
your sister Gina, man?

07:27.963 --> 07:29.590
I've been texting
her all morning.

07:29.590 --> 07:30.883
What's she doing?

07:30.883 --> 07:33.969
Eddie.

07:33.969 --> 07:35.513
Well, at least he's going
to be in a good mood

07:35.513 --> 07:36.972
once he finds out that
they're not going to be

07:36.972 --> 07:37.932
dancing at the party.

07:37.932 --> 07:41.477
My bad, does it
look like I care?

07:41.477 --> 07:42.770
How does Jesus
put up with you?

07:42.770 --> 07:44.522
He doesn't, we broke up.

07:44.522 --> 07:46.690
I can't keep track.

07:46.690 --> 07:47.691
You're the one
who gets drunk

07:47.691 --> 07:49.360
and screws every
skunka in East Los.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.986
Well, I'm not
drinking tonight.

07:50.986 --> 07:52.446
I'm trying to get
back with Ceci, so...

07:52.446 --> 07:54.031
Ceci's taking you back?

07:54.031 --> 07:55.950
Ah, hell, man,
maybe she's the one

07:55.950 --> 07:58.577
that needs to lay
off the tequila.

Just because I'm a mom
doesn't mean that I'm old.

08:33.821 --> 08:35.614
I meant for a dancer.

08:35.614 --> 08:37.533
Okay, we're lucky
if we work past 28.

we're good here.

08:54.341 --> 08:56.427
Brandie, collect the props.

08:56.427 --> 08:57.678
-What's up?
-You got to make changes

08:57.678 --> 08:59.847
to the show, they only
want girls to dance tonight.

08:59.847 --> 09:01.181
No, I already set
the choreography.

09:01.181 --> 09:03.017

text, you would have known this.

looking forward

09:04.059 --> 09:05.144
to sending that
money to my mom.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.562
Yeah, and I need
some new kicks, man.

09:06.562 --> 09:08.147
And I got a phone
bill to pay for.

09:08.147 --> 09:09.481
Yeah, what's up, Jacob?

09:09.481 --> 09:12.026

09:18.365 --> 09:20.367
Fine, I mean, at
least we get paid.

09:20.367 --> 09:22.912
Yo, man, on second thought,
I actually think I look

09:22.912 --> 09:24.455
like a Mexican
James Bond with this.

09:24.455 --> 09:25.706

I feel like I let him win
by not saying anything.

19:53.416 --> 19:55.252
I promised myself
I would never let

19:55.252 --> 19:56.836

19:56.836 --> 19:59.631
I just wish we didn't do
that dance in those outfits.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.092
I mean, maybe I led him on.

Just forget it,

20:11.518 --> 20:15.146
Thanks.

20:15.146 --> 20:16.481
Ooh!

20:16.481 --> 20:17.816
So are we friends now?

20:17.816 --> 20:22.487
I didn't say all that,
but I don't hate you.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.823
-Bye.
-Goodnight.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.616
You okay?

20:26.616 --> 20:29.160
Yeah, thanks to
you and Brandie.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.122
I guess she's not as
bad as we thought.

20:32.122 --> 20:34.541
That Jeremy guy
is such a dick.

20:34.541 --> 20:43.383
Listen, I'd never let an
asshole like that hurt you.

I like about you?

How you act all badass but...
