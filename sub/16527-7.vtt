Had his legs broken,

05:10.086 --> 05:11.188
stuffed in a suitcase

05:11.188 --> 05:12.491

under his fingernails.

to see it, am I right?

05:47.360 --> 05:49.966
We have a dead body
here, remember?

05:49.966 --> 05:52.170
So, you're walking to work
and you see caution tape,

05:52.170 --> 05:55.544
looky loos,
body shoved into a suitcase...

05:55.544 --> 05:56.546
and what?

05:56.546 --> 05:57.582
You just keep
your head down?

05:57.582 --> 05:59.586
Mm‐hmm.

05:59.586 --> 06:00.654
Mm‐hmm.
Hey, Bailey.

06:00.654 --> 06:02.123
I got diapers in the car.
Take her.

06:02.123 --> 06:03.527
Oh... okay.

06:03.527 --> 06:04.529
I mean, I don't know.

06:04.529 --> 06:05.664
I've never had
a baby before.

06:05.664 --> 06:07.234
Figure out what's
in her diaper.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.672
These go here.
All right.

06:09.672 --> 06:11.543
Thanks, guys.

06:11.543 --> 06:14.147
Awesome. I'll just... babysit.

06:17.888 --> 06:20.159
Reminds me of maquiladoras
across the border.

06:20.159 --> 06:21.963
Same sweatshop,
different city.

06:21.963 --> 06:23.700
This neighborhood
is full of them.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.969
LAPD.

06:27.708 --> 06:29.746

the guy outside.

06:30.914 --> 06:32.718
(clucks tongue)
Suitcase.

06:32.718 --> 06:34.221
...deceased.

06:35.591 --> 06:37.828
I'm gonna let
you do this.

06:37.828 --> 06:38.897
Did you know him?

06:40.868 --> 06:41.870
Yes.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.306
Can you ask your wife

06:43.306 --> 06:44.876
(laughing):
if you can give me a name?

06:44.876 --> 06:46.211
That's Richie Kim.

06:46.211 --> 06:47.982
He grew up with
our son, Vince.

06:47.982 --> 06:49.719
Richie.
Was Richie doing drugs?

06:49.719 --> 06:50.721
Was he selling them?

06:50.721 --> 06:51.756
No, nothing like that.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.627
Is this your son, Vince?

06:55.864 --> 06:57.635
I'm gonna need to talk to him.

06:57.635 --> 07:00.340
(speaks Korean)

07:00.340 --> 07:01.576
What'd she say?

07:01.576 --> 07:04.214
That wall... it's still wet.

07:06.553 --> 07:09.726
Oh, son of a bitch.

07:09.726 --> 07:11.863
MAN: It's an illegal search.
RIGGS: What's an illegal search?

07:11.863 --> 07:13.734
I just want to look
inside the crate.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.604
I said no.
Is‐is that a no or
is that like or a little no?

07:15.604 --> 07:16.773
Or, like, is there
a little yes in there?

07:16.773 --> 07:18.008
You have no warrant.
Here's the thing,
I had a warrant,

07:18.008 --> 07:20.213
but it's in my other pants.
I didn't wear those pants today.

07:20.213 --> 07:21.750
What are you looking at?

07:21.750 --> 07:22.985

What's happening, man?

07:23.987 --> 07:25.657
You making friends again?

07:25.657 --> 07:26.893
Yeah, you know me.

07:26.893 --> 07:29.766
So, uh...
when I was in El Paso, right,

07:29.766 --> 07:31.603
dealers across the
border used to try

07:31.603 --> 07:33.339
to smuggle their stuff
through these stuffed animals.

07:33.339 --> 07:35.611
I once found 20 kilos
inside of an Elmer Fudd.

07:35.611 --> 07:36.478
20 Kilos.

07:36.478 --> 07:38.249
You'd need a whole truck

25:54.105 --> 25:55.107
Oh, good.

25:55.107 --> 25:56.376
So tell me about your wife.

25:56.376 --> 25:58.046
What color are her eyes?

26:03.323 --> 26:06.764
Oh, uh, we could start
with an easier one.

26:06.764 --> 26:07.766
Uh, no, no, um...

26:07.766 --> 26:09.670
They're brown, yeah.

26:09.670 --> 26:10.939
PALMER (laughing):
My eyes?

26:10.939 --> 26:13.811
No, my eyes are green...
dummy.

26:13.811 --> 26:15.715
It's okay.
It's not his fault.

26:15.715 --> 26:17.385
He's colorblind.
(chuckles)

26:17.385 --> 26:18.788
Why don't you let
me handle this?

26:18.788 --> 26:20.090
Don't you want
to be surprised?

26:20.090 --> 26:23.463
No. No, not after
last Christmas.

26:23.463 --> 26:26.403
What about this one

26:26.403 --> 26:28.106
right over here‐‐
how much is that?

26:28.106 --> 26:29.810
We actually keep those
behind the counter.

26:29.810 --> 26:31.446
So if I could just
squeeze by you...

26:31.446 --> 26:32.916
You know what? First...

26:32.916 --> 26:34.385
Oh, goodness!

26:34.385 --> 26:35.922
Oh, honey, I just want
to thank you.

26:35.922 --> 26:37.158
I'm gonna love it!

26:37.158 --> 26:38.928
All right, that's enough.

26:38.928 --> 26:40.832
No, not quite.
I am just

26:40.832 --> 26:43.838
the luckiest girl
in the whole world, aren't I?

26:43.838 --> 26:45.474
He looks a little shell‐shocked.

26:45.474 --> 26:46.309
(chuckles)

26:46.309 --> 26:46.342
Well, he probably
just saw the price.

26:56.062 --> 26:57.064
Cruz!

26:57.064 --> 26:58.233
Yo.
What are you doing?

26:58.233 --> 26:59.503
Cross‐referencing
Bambi's call log

26:59.503 --> 27:00.972
with known
cartel associates.

27:00.972 --> 27:02.441
Forget that.
That'll take forever.

27:02.441 --> 27:04.713
Let me see your tough face,
like, like I'm a gangster.

27:04.713 --> 27:06.082
What?

27:06.082 --> 27:07.118
Perfect. Come on.

27:11.493 --> 27:12.796
Any movement
on Bambi's phone?

27:12.796 --> 27:14.499
Nothing unusual.

27:14.499 --> 27:16.035
Lunch,

27:16.035 --> 27:17.839
golf date, appointment

27:17.839 --> 27:18.941
for a bleaching.
Hmm.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.079
That one was a little unusual.

27:21.079 --> 27:22.148
Why?

27:22.148 --> 27:23.851
It wasn't for her teeth.

27:25.522 --> 27:26.791
(sighs)

27:28.828 --> 27:30.765
Gross.
You should see his trailer.

27:30.765 --> 27:32.969
Yeah.

27:32.969 --> 27:34.873
Hey, that was some pretty
good tap dancing earlier,

27:34.873 --> 27:36.844
pretending to be his wife.

27:36.844 --> 27:38.815
You like that, huh?
Yeah.

27:38.815 --> 27:39.983
I'm pretty sure
your partner didn't.

27:39.983 --> 27:40.919
I haven't seen him since.

27:40.919 --> 27:43.791
I think it threw him
a little, that's all.

27:43.791 --> 27:45.995
The man that goes running
into machine gun fire,

27:45.995 --> 27:47.999
that's the thing
that throws him?

27:47.999 --> 27:51.105
Wow. Boy, I'd love to meet
the woman that spun his head.

27:51.105 --> 27:52.809
She must be something else.

27:52.809 --> 27:55.013
Yeah.

27:55.013 --> 27:57.017
I heard she was.

27:59.088 --> 28:00.892
(bell dings)

28:01.927 --> 28:04.065
Cruz?

28:08.073 --> 28:09.509
You Bambi?

28:09.509 --> 28:11.145
I've been sent
to check up on you.

28:11.145 --> 28:13.016
BAMBI: You've got the wrong
person. I don't know you.

28:13.016 --> 28:14.553
CRUZ:
Don't play dumb, <i>blanquita.</i>

28:14.553 --> 28:16.891
You tipped off the cops
and helped the Hongs escape.

28:16.891 --> 28:18.126
I didn't.

28:18.126 --> 28:19.930
Swear to God.

28:19.930 --> 28:21.934
I had nothing to do with that.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.005
That's good.

28:24.005 --> 28:26.009
Keep saying it just like that.

28:27.111 --> 28:29.115
He might even believe you.

28:39.101 --> 28:40.304
Hi.

28:40.304 --> 28:42.174
I need to bring my husband's
dry cleaning in.

28:42.174 --> 28:43.310
Do you do one‐hour turnaround?

28:43.310 --> 28:44.613
She's not married.

28:44.613 --> 28:45.414
That's a meeting.

28:45.414 --> 28:46.884
CALDERA:
You have the wrong number.

28:46.884 --> 28:48.053
This is Valley Hardware.

28:48.053 --> 28:50.057
Valley Hardware, got it.

28:54.332 --> 28:55.635
PALMER:
That's the bug dropping out.

28:55.635 --> 28:56.637
Maybe I can reboot it.

28:56.637 --> 28:58.073
She found it.

28:58.073 --> 28:59.208
No way, she had no idea
it was there.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.611
All right, then she burned
the phone to protect herself.

29:00.611 --> 29:02.081
Either way,
we're about to lose her.

29:02.081 --> 29:04.018
What the hell are you doing?
Can you track this?

29:04.018 --> 29:06.022
Yes, but don't...
Hey, Riggs, whatever

29:06.022 --> 29:08.493
you're thinking of doing,
don't do it. We can follow her.

29:08.493 --> 29:10.297
She's gonna be looking over her
shoulder the entire time.

29:10.297 --> 29:11.499
Start tracking this now.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.869
What are you doing?

29:12.869 --> 29:15.140
She's gonna take me
to that meeting.

29:26.864 --> 29:27.799
PALMER: He's
in a trunk.

29:27.799 --> 29:29.536
The man locked himself
inside of a trunk.

29:29.536 --> 29:31.540
MURTAUGH: I wish I could say
it was the first time.

29:35.615 --> 29:38.186
Give me your keys.
Not a chance.

29:38.186 --> 29:40.057
You guys have done enough damage
to the DEA motor pool.

30:00.230 --> 30:01.700
Were you followed?

30:01.700 --> 30:03.904
Made sure I wasn't.

30:05.608 --> 30:07.612
Are you carrying
anything in your trunk?

30:07.612 --> 30:08.981
Golf clubs, maybe?

30:08.981 --> 30:10.918
No.

30:14.158 --> 30:15.628
Slide over, my friend.

30:15.628 --> 30:18.166
I'm gonna put a bullet
in the right side of the trunk.

30:18.166 --> 30:20.170
My right.

30:25.147 --> 30:27.184
Now...

30:27.184 --> 30:30.056
you're gonna drop your gun,
grip first,

30:30.056 --> 30:32.060
or the next bullet
goes right in the middle.

30:37.237 --> 30:39.308
(grunts softly)

30:39.308 --> 30:40.410
Mm‐hmm.

30:40.410 --> 30:42.447
Hi.

30:42.447 --> 30:43.249
I always get these

30:43.249 --> 30:45.086
German cars confused,
you know?

30:45.086 --> 30:47.090
Can't ever tell
which one's mine.

30:57.745 --> 30:59.749
(siren chirping)

31:05.060 --> 31:06.295
Bullet holes.

31:08.333 --> 31:09.936
Ready?

31:13.777 --> 31:15.982
They took him.

31:26.402 --> 31:28.406
(chains rattling)

31:28.406 --> 31:30.711
He's waking up.

31:32.715 --> 31:36.088
MAN:
Good morning, Detective.

31:37.090 --> 31:39.161
You have any questions?

31:39.161 --> 31:41.365
Hmm?
I do have one.

31:41.365 --> 31:43.469
The drugs you gave me...

31:43.469 --> 31:45.273
does it come in chewable form?

31:45.273 --> 31:46.375
BAMBI:
Wait, I don't like this.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.411
This wasn't part
of the deal.

31:47.411 --> 31:49.148
I sell purses.

31:49.148 --> 31:50.317
I'm on the board at the Riviera.

31:50.317 --> 31:51.319
This guy's a cop?

31:51.319 --> 31:53.289
What happens when people
start looking for him?

31:53.289 --> 31:54.859
I can't be involved in...

31:54.859 --> 31:56.763
(shell casing clatters)

31:59.201 --> 32:00.871
Okay.

32:00.871 --> 32:03.711
Now, don't be like Bambi here.

32:03.711 --> 32:05.815
I ask the questions.

32:05.815 --> 32:08.119
Okay?

32:08.119 --> 32:10.791
(indistinct radio transmission)

32:10.791 --> 32:12.461
MURTAUGH:
The whole division's on alert.

32:12.461 --> 32:14.833
Checkpoints.
BOLO on the minivan.

32:14.833 --> 32:17.137
Freeway's half a mile away
so we're pulling Caltrans feeds.

32:17.137 --> 32:18.373
Give me the keys.
Absolutely not. I'm driving.

32:18.373 --> 32:19.509
Palmer!

32:19.509 --> 32:22.047
I said I'm driving.
Get in.

32:22.849 --> 32:25.286
(muffled shouting)

32:25.286 --> 32:26.857
(gasping loudly)

32:26.857 --> 32:28.393
Talk to me.

32:28.393 --> 32:30.330
Answer my question, Detective.

32:30.330 --> 32:31.867
How many do you have?

32:31.867 --> 32:34.304
I'm sorry, you're going
to have to be more specific.

32:34.304 --> 32:35.775
I really just don't know
what you're...

32:35.775 --> 32:38.580
(burbling)

32:42.522 --> 32:45.326
Not yet, amigo.

32:45.326 --> 32:47.497
How many do you have?

32:47.497 --> 32:49.134
Look, how much longer
is this going to take?

32:49.134 --> 32:50.437
I have got to be somewhere
before...

32:52.374 --> 32:53.610
(grunts)

32:53.610 --> 32:54.445
(muffled shouts)

32:59.354 --> 33:00.891
(grunts)
(gasps)

33:00.891 --> 33:04.131
Just answer my question
and I will let you go.

33:04.131 --> 33:05.801
How many do you have?

33:05.801 --> 33:09.542
Okay, all right.
There's a...

33:09.542 --> 33:12.380
there's a ten... okay, then
there's a... (mutters quietly)

33:12.380 --> 33:14.351
Okay, hold on, four...
no, hold on, hold on.

33:14.351 --> 33:15.888
42. Wait a minute,
no, I didn't carry the one.

33:15.888 --> 33:17.190
I need...

33:19.394 --> 33:20.598
(muffled shouting)

33:21.600 --> 33:23.537
(muffled shouting)

33:23.537 --> 33:25.541
(grunting)

33:26.910 --> 33:29.582
(gasping)

33:29.582 --> 33:32.889
How many of my operations
have been compromised?

33:32.889 --> 33:34.926
I don't know. I don't know.

33:34.926 --> 33:36.563
I don't know.

33:36.563 --> 33:38.366
(shouts)

33:41.238 --> 33:43.109
♪ ♪

33:45.915 --> 33:47.384
Join me.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.370
(gasps)

33:57.370 --> 33:58.607
Not yet.

33:58.607 --> 34:00.443
Too easy, huh?

34:00.443 --> 34:01.412
Not yet.

34:01.412 --> 34:02.882
(quietly): Just kill me.

34:02.882 --> 34:05.153
Just kill me. Come on.

34:05.153 --> 34:06.856
Most men fight death,
but not you.

34:06.856 --> 34:08.359
You want it.

34:08.359 --> 34:09.562
Hmm?

34:09.562 --> 34:11.465
But there are others.

34:11.465 --> 34:13.469
Your partner, for instance.

34:13.469 --> 34:14.939
Does he have a family?

34:14.939 --> 34:17.377
(quietly):
Shut up. Stop it.

34:17.377 --> 34:18.880
Do they want to die?

34:19.949 --> 34:21.853
(grunts)

34:21.853 --> 34:23.489
(coughing)

34:26.261 --> 34:29.134
(grunting)

34:35.380 --> 34:37.350
(yells)

34:51.011 --> 34:53.215
(siren wailing in distance)

35:09.882 --> 35:12.287
(gun cocks)
Good news, Detective.

35:14.659 --> 35:17.497
I've decided to grant your wish.

35:27.383 --> 35:28.920
(clatters)

35:28.920 --> 35:31.726
Let's get this over with.

35:33.329 --> 35:35.333
Final offer, <i>guero.</i>

35:35.333 --> 35:37.437
You tell me what you know,

35:37.437 --> 35:39.575
and I give you what you want.

35:39.575 --> 35:41.311
One shot.

35:41.311 --> 35:43.215
Think about her.

35:44.585 --> 35:45.654
Miranda?

35:45.654 --> 35:47.490
Hmm?

35:49.494 --> 35:50.731
You say her name again

35:50.731 --> 35:52.500
and again.

35:53.503 --> 35:55.507
She's waiting for you,
Detective.

36:01.018 --> 36:02.387
Stop. Down that alley.

36:02.387 --> 36:03.189
No, the showroom's
on the next block.

36:03.189 --> 36:05.359
Stop the damn car.
I saw something.

36:05.359 --> 36:06.395
Something or someone?

36:06.395 --> 36:07.497
I don't know.

36:07.497 --> 36:09.000
We're getting one shot at this
at best.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.203
What did you see?

36:11.573 --> 36:13.610
There better be more bullets
in that gun.

36:13.610 --> 36:15.479
(tires squealing)

36:15.479 --> 36:17.483
Last chance.

36:17.483 --> 36:21.593
How many of my operations
do you have?!

36:21.593 --> 36:22.761
Shoot me!
How many?!

36:22.761 --> 36:24.532
Shoot me!

36:26.068 --> 36:27.337
(grunts)

36:29.609 --> 36:32.380
(tires screech)

36:32.380 --> 36:33.717
(door alarm dings)
Where's Riggs?

36:33.717 --> 36:34.552
Riggs!

36:37.591 --> 36:39.327
Back, back up!

36:39.327 --> 36:40.631
Oh!

36:40.631 --> 36:41.799
You want to back...?

36:41.799 --> 36:43.402
(grunts)

36:43.402 --> 36:44.672
Hey, Rog.

36:44.672 --> 36:47.711
Hey, you don't have
to worry about it, pal.

36:47.711 --> 36:49.548
She ran over me.
I got it.

36:49.548 --> 36:51.051
You should never operate
a vehicle again.

36:51.051 --> 36:53.088
Well, you were
in the middle of the road.

36:53.088 --> 36:55.026
That's right,
I was in the middle of the road,

36:55.026 --> 36:56.829
and you guys have headlights

36:56.829 --> 36:58.667
and streetlights
and the moon's out.

36:58.667 --> 36:59.835
Could be you're just
one of those guys

36:59.835 --> 37:01.371
people like to hit with cars.

37:01.371 --> 37:02.106
(chuckles)

37:02.106 --> 37:03.275
(groans)

37:10.423 --> 37:12.427
(sighs)

37:12.427 --> 37:13.797
(footsteps approaching)

37:13.797 --> 37:15.667
(Riggs clears his throat)

37:21.779 --> 37:23.783
Thought you'd be home
by now.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.687

broke up a few years ago,
