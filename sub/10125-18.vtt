MR. MATTHEWS,

10:27.600 --> 10:30.200
AT THE END
OF EACH SCHOOL YEAR,

10:30.200 --> 10:33.500
I ALSO TAKE
A FINAL EXAMINATION.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.967
I BET YOU DO REALLY WELL.

10:35.967 --> 10:40.500
I EXAMINE MY EFFECTIVENESS
AS A TEACHER,

10:40.500 --> 10:43.100
AND I WONDER...

10:43.100 --> 10:44.100
WHAT HAVE I TAUGHT?

10:44.100 --> 10:47.233
WHO HAVE I REACHED
THIS YEAR?

10:47.233 --> 10:48.500
WELL...

10:48.500 --> 10:51.967
THIS YEAR, AFTER SEEING
WHAT WAS DONE TO MY HOUSE,

10:51.967 --> 10:57.500
I REALIZE THAT <i>THEY  </i>
HAVE FINALLY REACHED <i>ME. </i>

10:57.500 --> 11:00.066
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:00.066 --> 11:03.367
I BELIEVE THE TERM WAS
"DINOSAUR," WASN'T IT?

11:03.367 --> 11:05.967
I'M AN OLD DINOSAUR.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.233
WHICH IS
A GOOD THING.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.400
I MEAN, PEOPLE
LOVE DINOSAURS.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.600
YOU GOT
YOUR BARNEYS,

11:12.600 --> 11:14.567
YOUR
<i>JURASSIC PARKS... </i>

11:14.567 --> 11:16.000
MR. MATTHEWS--

11:16.000 --> 11:17.467
WHO COULD FORGET
ABOUT DINO FLINTSTONE?

11:17.467 --> 11:19.000
[YELPS]

11:21.100 --> 11:23.000
MR. MATTHEWS...

11:23.000 --> 11:25.700
I'M RETIRING
AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

11:27.967 --> 11:31.834
THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
WILL BE VERY SOON.

11:31.834 --> 11:32.867
HEY, FEENY,

11:32.867 --> 11:34.900
ABOUT YOUR
EXAM SCHEDULE.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.400
YES, MR. BURGESS.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.000
IF YOU
DON'T MOVE IT,
WE AIN'T GONNA SHOW.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.500
WELL, THAT
IS YOUR RIGHT.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.767
AND OF COURSE, IF YOU
DON'T TAKE THE EXAM,

11:44.767 --> 11:47.700
IT IS MY RIGHT
TO FAIL YOU. HMM?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.467
THAT OLD DINOSAUR
JUST DOESN'T WANT
TO BECOME EXTINCT.

11:55.467 --> 11:58.500
I WISH I'D SEEN
HIS FACE WHEN HE
SAW HIS HOUSE.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.567
I DID.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.900
MATTHEWS, YOU KISS-UP,
WHAT'D YOU TELL HIM?

12:02.900 --> 12:04.400
WHOA. EASY, EASY.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.834
LOOK,
CORY'S COOL, O.K.?

12:05.834 --> 12:07.767
HE WOULDN'T
HAVE SQUEALED.

12:07.767 --> 12:10.600
DOES THAT MAKE ME COOL,
SHAWN?

12:10.600 --> 12:12.300
IS THAT WHAT
MAKES YOU SO COOL?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.300
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
CORY.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.700
CORY, LIGHTEN UP, O.K.?

12:17.700 --> 12:20.100
YOU SAID WE SHOULD
STAND UP TO FEENY.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.734
YEAH, BUT
NOT VANDALIZE
HIS HOME.

12:22.734 --> 12:25.100
I WASN'T THERE.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.233
YOU KNEW
ABOUT IT.

12:26.233 --> 12:28.000
WAS I SUPPOSED
TO SAY,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.967
"STAY AWAY
FROM FEENY'S HOUSE"?

12:29.967 --> 12:31.734
YOU DIDN'T
STOP 'EM, O.K.?

12:31.734 --> 12:33.767
I THINK
THAT MAKES YOU
RESPONSIBLE.

12:33.767 --> 12:37.467
ME? YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT STARTED
THIS WHOLE THING.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.700
THEN I THINK
THAT MAKES ME
RESPONSIBLE, TOO.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.867
WELL, ONCE AGAIN,
THANKS FOR
YOUR HELP.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.734
I COULDN'T REACH
ALL THE EGGS,

12:51.734 --> 12:55.500
BUT THROW SOME CHEESE
UP THERE ON A HOT DAY,

12:55.500 --> 12:58.700
YOU'LL HAVE ONE HECK
OF AN OMELET.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.400
YOU'RE
A FUNNY MAN, ALAN.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.000
YEAH. WELL,
I'M GOING TO WASH UP
AND, UH...

13:04.000 --> 13:05.233
LOOK, GEORGE,

13:05.233 --> 13:08.300
I KNOW THIS, UH,
BOTHERS YOU,
BUT REMEMBER,

13:08.300 --> 13:11.734
IT WASN'T
THE WHOLE SCHOOL,
JUST A COUPLE OF KIDS.

13:11.734 --> 13:13.600
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT,

13:13.600 --> 13:15.400
BUT IT REALLY
BOTHERS ME.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.734
GEORGE...

13:25.900 --> 13:27.300
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

13:27.300 --> 13:31.233
OH, WELL, WE'VE HAD
A WILD TOGA PARTY,
MR. TURNER.

13:31.233 --> 13:32.900
SORRY WE DIDN'T
INVITE YOU.

13:32.900 --> 13:36.367
I HEARD THIS RUMOR
YOU'RE RETIRING.
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

13:36.367 --> 13:37.300
YES, WELL,

13:37.300 --> 13:39.300
I'VE WORKED HARD
FOR MANY YEARS,

13:39.300 --> 13:42.400
AND THIS
JUST FEELS...

13:42.400 --> 13:44.000
RIGHT NOW.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.200
OH, MY GOD,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.300
TO FINALLY
HAVE TIME TO GARDEN,

13:47.300 --> 13:48.900
TO READ
A GOOD BOOK,

13:48.900 --> 13:52.500
TO TRAVEL.
TO DO THE THINGS
THAT I LOVE.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.200
YOU LOVE TEACHING.
COME ON.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.700
DON'T GIVE THESE GOONS
THE POWER TO CHANGE
YOUR LIFE.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.700
YOU DON'T GARDEN,
DO YOU, JONATHAN?

14:01.700 --> 14:04.000
NO.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.100
BUT I CAN SEE WHERE
THAT TOILET PAPER PLANT

14:06.100 --> 14:09.200
WOULD COME IN HANDY
SOMETIMES.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.600
I'M SURROUNDED
BY FUNNY MEN.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.700
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.300
HERE IN THE GARDEN,

14:17.300 --> 14:19.667
AT THE END
OF EACH SEASON,

14:19.667 --> 14:21.300
YOU SEE THE RESULTS

14:21.300 --> 14:23.100
OF THE SEEDS
YOU'VE PLANTED.

14:23.100 --> 14:26.934
AND EVEN IN
A PARTICULARLY
BAD SEASON,

14:26.934 --> 14:28.767
THERE WAS STILL...

14:28.767 --> 14:29.967
GROWTH.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.800
SO, MR. TURNER,
SORRY...

14:34.133 --> 14:36.667
BUT I MUST ADMIT,
THESE DAYS,

14:36.667 --> 14:39.300
I QUITE PREFER
THE GARDEN.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.033
WELL, CAN YOU
SEE IT?

14:49.033 --> 14:50.467
HUH?

14:50.467 --> 14:52.800
YOUR LITTLE BOY'S
IN LOVE.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.000
OH, REALLY?
WHAT'S THIS ONE'S NAME?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.100
BRENDA.
BRENDA MARSH.

14:58.100 --> 15:01.300
OH, THAT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE I WORK WITH
A BRENDA MARSH.

15:04.233 --> 15:07.967
ERIC, NO. YOU CAN'T
DATE BRENDA MARSH.

15:07.967 --> 15:09.600
'CAUSE SHE'S CANADIAN,
RIGHT?

15:09.600 --> 15:12.734
NO. 'CAUSE
SHE'S OLDER THAN YOU.

15:12.734 --> 15:13.934
AN OLDER WOMAN, HUH?

15:13.934 --> 15:17.967
AN OLDER
<i>FOREIGN </i>WOMAN.

15:17.967 --> 15:21.033
ALAN,
ERIC CANNOT
GO OUT WITH HER.

15:21.033 --> 15:22.700
I WAS SETTING HER UP
WITH JONATHAN.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.000
SHE SHOWED UP
AND HE DIDN'T.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.867
FINDERS KEEPUHS,
LOSERS WEEPUHS.

15:28.867 --> 15:32.567
WAIT. IF YOUR MOTHER
SAYS YOU CAN'T DATE
BRENDA MARSH,

15:32.567 --> 15:34.300
THEN YOU CAN'T DATE
BRENDA MARSH.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.100
HOW OLD IS SHE?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.700
27.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.467
OH, WELL,
IN THAT CASE, WELL,

15:38.467 --> 15:40.567
YOU CAN'T
DATE HER A LOT!

15:40.567 --> 15:41.700
ALAN!
WHAT?

15:41.700 --> 15:44.000
SHE IS TOO OLD
FOR ERIC.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.133
HONEY, HOLD ON.
HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW?

15:46.133 --> 15:48.200
24, 25? 40?

15:48.200 --> 15:50.500
18.
NO!

15:50.500 --> 15:51.400
GUYS, GUYS,
GUYS, GUYS.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.133
I MEAN, COME ON.

15:53.133 --> 15:55.033
WE'RE BOTH
O.K. WITH IT.

15:55.033 --> 15:57.600
WHEN TWO MATURE ADULTS
MAKE A CONNECTION--

15:57.600 --> 16:00.767
OH, COME ON!
YOU NEVER
GOT ME A PONY!

16:00.767 --> 16:04.000
BRENDA IS
OLDER THAN YOU,
MORE SOPHISTICATED,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.133
MORE EXPERIENCED.

16:05.133 --> 16:06.834
IS THIS
MAKING SENSE?

16:06.834 --> 16:10.133
ABSOLUTELY.
HERE'S MY WALLET
AND MY KEYS.

16:10.133 --> 16:12.700
WAKE ME
WHEN YOU GET IN.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.900
HE'LL BE THE ONE
ON THE COUCH.

16:14.900 --> 16:15.867
HA HA HA.

16:17.133 --> 16:18.400
THIS PLACE IS, UM,

16:18.400 --> 16:20.400
IT'S KIND OF...
KIND OF FUNKY.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.233
I TRIED
TO GET RESERVATIONS

16:22.233 --> 16:23.467
AT YOUR
FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

16:23.467 --> 16:25.600
CHATEAU
LE FON DU LAC.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.300
YEAH, O.K.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.700
HA HA HA HA.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.667
DID I MENTION
YOU LOOK LOVELY
TONIGHT?

16:31.667 --> 16:34.100
YEAH, YOU DID,
ERIC. THANKS.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.100
UM...SO...

16:35.100 --> 16:37.300
TELL ME. WHAT
DO YOU DO, UM...

16:37.300 --> 16:39.700
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU'RE
NOT IN SCHOOL?

16:39.700 --> 16:42.033
DO YOU TRAVEL?

16:42.033 --> 16:44.967
LAST SUMMER,
I BUMMED MY WAY
THROUGH PITTSBURGH.

16:44.967 --> 16:46.100
HA HA HA HA.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.900
RIGHT.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.500
I'M--I'M SERIOUS.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.200
OH. UM,
EVER BEEN TO EUROPE?

16:52.200 --> 16:53.500
JUST PITTSBURGH,

16:53.500 --> 16:55.367
BUT
THERE IS A LARGE
POLISH COMMUNITY.

16:55.367 --> 16:56.567
RIGHT, RIGHT.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.100
YOU KNOW,

16:58.100 --> 17:00.967
I THINK YOU AND I
ARE JUST MISSING HERE.

17:00.967 --> 17:04.567
WHAT? MISSING?
HERE TONIGHT? YEAH.

17:04.567 --> 17:07.467
YEAH.
YEAH.

17:07.467 --> 17:10.200
I JUST REALIZED
WHY THE SERVICE
IS SO SLOW.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.600
THEY DON'T
HAVE WAITERS.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.600
SO I'LL GO ORDER US
SOMETHING.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.867
GOOD IDEA.
GREAT.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.600
MATTHEWS,
YOU LOOK SICK.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.934
WHAT DID YOU ORDER
SO I DON'T GET
THE SAME THING?

17:21.934 --> 17:23.500
YOU EVER
BEEN TO EUROPE?

17:23.500 --> 17:27.100
YEAH. THE FOOD HERE'S
NOTHING LIKE IT, THOUGH.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.567
COME HERE.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.934
JONATHAN TURNER,
BRENDA MARSH.

17:31.934 --> 17:35.000
HEY, YEAH,

THE OTHER NIGHT.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.900

17:36.900 --> 17:39.200
HA HA HA HA.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.200
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING TO GO.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.500
I'VE GOT TO STUDY,
YOU KNOW. EXAMS.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.400
THIS GUY'S TESTS...

17:45.400 --> 17:47.667
IF YOU HIT IT OFF,
WILL THIS HELP ME--

17:47.667 --> 17:48.934
NO.
JUST CHECKING.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.300
ERIC, HI.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.300
SO, CHRISTY...

17:54.300 --> 17:56.200
YOU EVER
BEEN TO EUROPE?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.600
NO, BUT THIS SUMMER,
MY FAMILY'S GOING
TO PITTSBURGH.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
MARRY ME?

18:00.800 --> 18:03.000
O.K. TELL ME ABOUT
<i>THE GREAT GATSBY. </i>

18:04.400 --> 18:06.967
THE BEST
HOCKEY PLAYER
OF ALL TIME.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.300
NEXT.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.467
THEY'RE AT SCHOOL.
WHO?

18:10.467 --> 18:13.033
DENNY AND THOSE JERKS
GOT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
WITH 'EM.

18:13.033 --> 18:14.700
THEY'RE UP TO
SOMETHING BAD.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.100
[SHOUTING]

18:23.400 --> 18:24.700
I'M CALLING
THE COPS.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.700
THERE'S NO TIME.
THIS IS OUR SCHOOL.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.300
I'M NOT
TURNING MY BACK.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.467
I SLEEP HERE
EVERY DAY!

18:30.467 --> 18:32.100
I KNOW, O.K.?

18:32.100 --> 18:34.500
BUT THE POLICE ARE
TRAINED IN HANDLING
UNRULY CROWDS.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.934
COME ON.

18:35.934 --> 18:37.567
I'M RIGHT
BEHIND YOU.

18:37.567 --> 18:39.000
[SHOUTING]

18:39.000 --> 18:40.200
HEY, DENNY!

18:40.200 --> 18:42.300
HUNTER, YOU'RE
JUST IN TIME.
HERE'S YOUR--

18:42.300 --> 18:43.600
DUDE, HERE. GO CRAZY.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.000
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:47.967 --> 18:49.400
YOU GOING
TO STOP ME?

18:50.767 --> 18:52.367
I DIDN'T
THINK SO.

18:52.367 --> 18:53.767
WHO IS THIS GUY?

18:56.734 --> 18:58.000
GUYS!

18:59.100 --> 19:00.834
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

19:00.834 --> 19:03.400
TO SHOW FEENY
WE'RE NOT TAKING
HIS STINKING TESTS.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.200
YEAH, WE ARE.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.800
WE'RE TAKING
HIS STINKING TESTS

19:06.800 --> 19:08.133
OFF HIS
STINKING DESK.

19:08.133 --> 19:09.900
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY STUDYING?

19:09.900 --> 19:12.200
WHO NEEDS
THAT STUFF
FEENY TEACHES?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.300
IT'S ABOUT
DEAD OLD GUYS
LIKE HIM.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.500
HE DOESN'T
TEACH HISTORY.
HE <i>IS </i>HISTORY.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.700
HE DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT US.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.734
OF COURSE
HE CARES ABOUT YOU.

19:19.734 --> 19:22.834
HE'S TRYING TO PUSH
THIS LITTLE NUGGET
OF EDUCATION

19:22.834 --> 19:26.834
PAST YOUR BASEBALL STATISTICS
AND YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD,

19:26.834 --> 19:28.300
RIGHT HERE.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.834
TOUCH MY HEAD
AGAIN,

19:29.834 --> 19:31.100
I'LL BREAK
YOUR FINGER.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.300
YOU SEE,
I LEARNED SOMETHING.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.100
MORE THAN YOU'LL
LEARN FROM FEENY.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.934
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:37.934 --> 19:40.300
LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING
I LEARNED FROM FEENY.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.233
YOU CAN COME
TO THE SCHOOLYARD

19:42.233 --> 19:44.000
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.133
AMENDMENT ONE OF
THE BILL OF RIGHTS.

19:48.133 --> 19:49.300
SHAWN?

19:49.300 --> 19:52.233
I ACCIDENTALLY
READ THE CHAPTER.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.033
