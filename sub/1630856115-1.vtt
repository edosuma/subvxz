02:23.456 --> 02:24.890
<i>Welcome to Dogedin.</i>

02:24.990 --> 02:27.194
<i>Well, technically,</i>
<i>it's Dunedin,</i>

02:27.294 --> 02:30.396
<i>but as you can see,</i>
<i>our town might be small,</i>

02:30.496 --> 02:32.897
<i>but our love for dogs is big.</i>

02:32.997 --> 02:35.167
<i>Of course, it's the perfect</i>
<i>small town now,</i>

02:35.267 --> 02:37.069
<i>but perfect can get</i>
<i>a little boring,</i>

02:37.169 --> 02:39.904
<i>and that's how this summer</i>
<i>was starting to look.</i>

02:40.004 --> 02:42.074
<i>But boy, were we wrong.</i>

02:42.174 --> 02:45.511
<i>Everything changed</i>
<i>when a very special dog</i>
<i>showed up:</i>

02:45.611 --> 02:47.246
<i>My dog Radar.</i>

02:47.346 --> 02:49.648
<i>Uh, don't you mean</i>
<i>our dog?</i>

02:49.747 --> 02:51.783
<i>Fine, our dog.</i>

02:51.883 --> 02:53.385
<i>This is Kylie.</i>

02:53.485 --> 02:57.854
<i>This summer we got to see Radar</i>
<i>do all kinds of cool stuff.</i>

02:57.955 --> 03:00.924
<i>- Like...</i>
<i>- Gabe, don't give away</i>
<i>the story!</i>

03:01.024 --> 03:04.027
<i>Sorry. Let's just start</i>
<i>at the beginning.</i>

03:06.130 --> 03:08.633
<i>I guess it all started</i>
<i>with these two geniuses.</i>

03:12.403 --> 03:15.005
Jeez Louise, Doc.
Couldn't you take the ramp?!

03:18.976 --> 03:21.713
At last!
At last, Dobbins!

03:23.615 --> 03:26.617
Glorious,
delectable freedom!

03:26.717 --> 03:29.919
For over a year
I was languishing
in that infernal cesspool,

03:30.019 --> 03:32.356
finger painting and making
popsicle stick houses

03:32.456 --> 03:37.427
whilst hoping,
yearning, dreaming
for this stupendous moment

03:37.527 --> 03:40.963
where my flesh can roam
as free as my genius intellect.

03:41.064 --> 03:43.667
I still
can't believe it worked, Doc!

03:43.766 --> 03:45.935
Broad daylight?

03:46.035 --> 03:48.205
Well, everyone escapes
at night.

03:48.305 --> 03:51.441
But daytime?
No one will see that coming.

03:51.541 --> 03:52.808
You must remember,
Dobbins.

03:52.908 --> 03:55.010
The obvious is reserved
for simpletons.

03:55.111 --> 03:58.247
Mm-hmm.

03:58.347 --> 04:00.316
Run!

04:50.863 --> 04:52.366
You must be the new chief.

04:52.466 --> 04:53.701
Yes. Joe Ramey.

04:53.801 --> 04:56.670
Sebastian Fleming,
the mayor of Dunedin.

04:56.770 --> 04:58.305
- Just like the picture.
- Uh, yeah.

04:58.405 --> 04:59.239
Ethel!

04:59.340 --> 05:00.940
Come on out
and meet the new chief!

05:02.142 --> 05:04.244
- That's the new chief?
- Mm-hmm.

05:05.779 --> 05:07.448
I have girdles
older than him.

05:07.548 --> 05:09.350
Cursed with a baby face.

05:09.450 --> 05:12.119
Come on now, Ethel, be nice.
He's come all the way
from Miami.

05:12.219 --> 05:14.688
- We're lucky to have him.
- Miami?

05:14.788 --> 05:17.324
Why on God's green Earth
would you come here?

05:17.424 --> 05:21.260
Ethel is your secretary,
receptionist and dispatch,

05:21.361 --> 05:23.429
all rolled
into one saucy person.

05:25.498 --> 05:28.867
Wow. I have not seen
one of those in a while.

05:28.967 --> 05:30.770
We got this
just last month.

05:30.869 --> 05:32.772
Brand new fax machine.

05:32.871 --> 05:34.474
Huh. They escaped yesterday

05:34.574 --> 05:37.710
from the prison
for the criminally insane,
apparently.

05:37.810 --> 05:39.812
Ugh. They want us
to put 'em up.

05:39.911 --> 05:41.647
I'm gonna go make copies.

05:41.748 --> 05:44.417
Great. I'll get one
of the officers on it
right away.

05:44.517 --> 05:46.051
Officers?

05:47.119 --> 05:48.086
Yes.

05:48.186 --> 05:50.122
Where is everyone else,
by the way?

05:50.222 --> 05:53.924
It's just you
and me, sweetheart.

05:54.024 --> 05:58.330
Look, I know this operation
is probably smaller
than you're used to,

05:58.430 --> 06:00.766
and you might be saying
to yourself right now,

06:00.866 --> 06:02.367
"Oh, my God.
What did I get myself into?

06:02.467 --> 06:05.570
My life is over,
all my dreams are crushed."

06:05.670 --> 06:09.107
But Dunedin grows on you...
or so they say.

06:09.207 --> 06:11.942
And you get used
to the quiet,
after a while.

06:13.044 --> 06:15.045
Trust me. Quiet is good.

06:16.012 --> 06:18.816
Outstanding. Okay, time
to start the day.

06:18.948 --> 06:23.687
Make sure you put those up.

06:23.788 --> 06:25.623
How dangerous
could these jokers be?

06:46.743 --> 06:50.280
Ah, home, sweet home!

06:51.781 --> 06:54.484
Here, within these walls,
we shall commune
with science itself

06:54.584 --> 06:55.819
to create that

06:55.919 --> 06:59.456
which has never been created!

06:59.556 --> 07:00.523
Cool.

07:01.858 --> 07:03.827
Your response is overwhelming.

07:03.927 --> 07:06.162
Come, let's see
to fruition the brainchild

07:06.262 --> 07:08.498
which has taken me years
to birth.

07:13.802 --> 07:16.638
Oh, good thinking, Doc.
I'm starving.

07:16.738 --> 07:19.006
Oh, it's not food.

07:19.107 --> 07:21.143
Here, within this icy chamber,

07:21.243 --> 07:26.013
lies a one-way ticket to riches
beyond our wildest dreams.

07:28.183 --> 07:30.085
Well, mine anyway.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.001
Behold, Dobbins.

07:48.102 --> 07:49.570
When I'm finished with her,

07:49.670 --> 07:55.042
she'll be the greatest thing
that's ever walked the planet!

07:55.142 --> 07:56.911
How's a dead dog
gonna do that?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.746
She's not dead!

07:58.846 --> 08:02.083
She's frozen...
in time!

08:04.118 --> 08:05.920
I relieved her
from a shelter

08:06.019 --> 08:08.154
just before they got me
on tax fraud.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.992
Tax fraud? I thought it was
because you went insane.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.694
- Hmm. A technicality,
Dobbins.

08:14.794 --> 08:15.929
A mere technicality.

08:17.364 --> 08:20.467
Oh, they laughed at me
at medical school...

08:21.801 --> 08:24.471
they laughed at me at MIT.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.474
They even laughed at me
at my needlepoint class.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.677
But I will show them.

08:32.612 --> 08:33.880
I will teach them.

08:36.048 --> 08:39.051
I will teach them all!

08:46.659 --> 08:47.693
It's alive!

08:47.793 --> 08:50.796
It's alive!

08:50.896 --> 08:53.732
Whoa! She looks like
a real dog!

08:53.832 --> 08:55.501
Well, of course
she looks real!

08:55.601 --> 08:57.736
We don't want her to arouse
any suspicion.

08:57.836 --> 09:01.006
Her mannerisms and appearance
must seem natural.

09:01.106 --> 09:06.244
Oh, yes,
she's my perfect creation
and I am her Frankenstein.

09:06.344 --> 09:07.979
Well, wouldn't she be
Frankenstein?

09:08.079 --> 09:10.648
No, you fool.
I'm Frankenstein.

09:10.748 --> 09:13.785
I'm pretty sure
the monster is Frankenstein.
Geez, read a book, Doc.

09:13.885 --> 09:16.955
I refuse to argue Gothic
literature with an imbecile.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.756
What are we
going to name her?

09:18.856 --> 09:19.958
We?!

09:20.059 --> 09:22.260
I am going to name her...

09:22.360 --> 09:23.595
Dog.

09:23.695 --> 09:26.364
- That's no fun.
- I didn't build her for fun.

09:26.464 --> 09:30.834
I built her to find
undiscovered pirate treasure.

09:30.934 --> 09:32.070
She's a R.A.D.A.R.

09:32.169 --> 09:35.906
A Remote Activated
Doubloon Acquiring Rex.

09:36.006 --> 09:37.240
What's a doubloon?

09:37.341 --> 09:40.611
Spanish gold!
Beautiful Spanish gold!

09:40.711 --> 09:42.813
And the coast of Florida
is littered with it!

09:42.913 --> 09:45.616
And all these gadgets on her
are gonna help us find it?

09:45.716 --> 09:48.852
Correct. And not only
can she understand English,

09:48.952 --> 09:52.789
she can connect
to any cellular device
and communicate via text.

09:52.889 --> 09:54.157
Whoa! Really?

09:54.257 --> 09:56.460
Yes. The dog can text.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.096
Hardly a stroke
of inventive genius.

09:59.195 --> 10:01.163
Any five-year-old
can do that.

10:01.263 --> 10:02.732
Okay, so, Dog,

10:02.832 --> 10:06.936
what do you think of the name
of Lady Cecily Von Finglesworth?

10:07.037 --> 10:09.705
Dobbins,
let's keep it simple.

10:09.805 --> 10:11.374
Her name is Dog.

10:13.409 --> 10:16.679
She says "Call me what
you wish, Master."

10:17.780 --> 10:19.682
He is not your master.
I am your master.

10:19.782 --> 10:22.451
And I make the rules,
and your name is Dog!

10:23.619 --> 10:27.455
Now, Dog, are you ready
to make me rich?

10:27.555 --> 10:29.324
"Yes, Master."

10:29.424 --> 10:32.193
Good girl.

10:33.828 --> 10:35.797
Mother would be so proud.

10:37.766 --> 10:39.901
Well, that's it,
it's been a long day.

10:40.001 --> 10:41.603
Our training
begins tomorrow.

10:42.504 --> 10:44.572
Uh, Doc...

10:44.673 --> 10:48.009
I-I-I feel bad
leaving her here all alone.

10:48.110 --> 10:51.413
Oh, come on, Dobbins!
She doesn't have
any feelings.

10:51.513 --> 10:53.548
It's not like she's
a real dog at all.

10:53.648 --> 10:56.617
Come on,
it's been a long day.

11:09.496 --> 11:11.365
So, what have you
got planned
for the summer?

11:11.465 --> 11:13.000
- Not much.
- Same.

11:13.101 --> 11:16.236
I might help my mom at the cafÃ©,
but there's no point, really.

11:16.336 --> 11:17.471
It's usually empty.

11:17.571 --> 11:19.573
Oh, my God. She makes
the best desserts.

11:19.673 --> 11:22.609
Yeah. Too bad there's hardly
anyone around to eat them.

11:22.710 --> 11:25.478
Tell me about it.
This place is a ghost town,

11:25.578 --> 11:27.714
only not nearly as cool,
'cause there's no ghosts.

11:27.814 --> 11:28.781
Hm. Yeah.

11:28.881 --> 11:30.084
See ya tomorrow?

11:30.184 --> 11:32.218
Maybe we can look
for sea glass or something.

11:32.318 --> 11:34.487
Yay.

11:38.558 --> 11:40.593
Now, Dog, today is
your first day of training.

11:40.693 --> 11:43.396
I have hidden a doubloon
somewhere within these walls.

11:43.496 --> 11:46.933
- Your job is to retrieve it.
- Oooh. Like hide and seek.

11:47.034 --> 11:48.334
I love hide and seek.

11:48.434 --> 11:49.936
I used to play
hide and seek
with my family.

11:50.037 --> 11:52.370
They still
haven't found me.

11:52.471 --> 11:54.005
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

11:54.107 --> 11:55.174
Swiftly moving on.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.609
Now once her training
is complete,

11:57.709 --> 12:02.181
I will instruct her to go find
the largest cache of doubloons
in America.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.949
- Just like that?
- Yes.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.717
No fancy code word
or Bat-signal?

12:05.817 --> 12:08.820
Just "Dog, go find the
largest cache of doubloons in
America".

12:08.920 --> 12:11.289
Whoa! She's really fast!

12:11.389 --> 12:13.126
Well done, Dobbins!
Now we lost her!

12:13.226 --> 12:15.027
We'll just use
the tracking device.

12:15.128 --> 12:16.528
Tracking device?

12:16.628 --> 12:19.132
Well,
she's a bionic dog.

12:19.232 --> 12:21.565
I mean, surely
you put one in her...

12:21.665 --> 12:23.201
Didn't you?

12:23.300 --> 12:25.237
Oh, shut up,
Dobbins!

12:25.336 --> 12:26.537
Um...

12:32.376 --> 12:33.711
There's my boy.

12:33.811 --> 12:35.479
How was your last day
of school?

12:35.579 --> 12:38.582
- Excited about your summer?
- Totally.

12:38.682 --> 12:41.986
Well, I had another busy day
at the cafe.

12:42.087 --> 12:44.455
Not just one
or two customers,

12:44.555 --> 12:47.757
but three!
Can you believe it?

12:47.857 --> 12:49.592
Things will pick up.

12:56.633 --> 12:57.767
What?

12:57.867 --> 13:00.436
There's something
I need to talk
to you about.

13:02.705 --> 13:05.875
You know hard things
have been on us
these past few years since...

13:05.975 --> 13:08.678
- Since Dad.
- Yes.

13:09.612 --> 13:11.548
Let's face it.
This town is
on its last legs,

13:11.648 --> 13:15.019
and I don't know
what else to do, but...

13:15.119 --> 13:16.451
You know
how much I love it here,

13:16.552 --> 13:19.755
but I think it's time
to sell the diner and move.

13:19.855 --> 13:22.292
Move?!
This is our home!

13:22.391 --> 13:23.826
I know.
I don't want to either,

13:23.926 --> 13:26.562
but we'd be moving in
with grandma
in a bigger town,

13:26.662 --> 13:28.797
with more opportunities and...

13:28.897 --> 13:30.966
Wait a minute.
I thought you hated it here?

13:31.067 --> 13:33.969
I do, but Ky--

13:35.804 --> 13:37.439
Maybe we can move
some place close

13:37.539 --> 13:40.243
and I can bring you here
once a month for a visit.

13:40.342 --> 13:43.878
- That'd be nice, right?
- No! This is so unfair!

13:43.978 --> 13:45.012
This is more than unfair!

13:45.113 --> 13:47.381
This is just... ugh!

13:52.587 --> 13:54.989
I wish you were here, Dad.

13:55.090 --> 13:57.125
Gabe? Can I come in?

13:59.760 --> 14:00.862
Yeah.

14:01.963 --> 14:05.566
Please don't be mad at me.
You know if there was
any other way...

14:08.170 --> 14:10.838
I miss him too.

14:10.938 --> 14:12.106
Every day.

14:13.974 --> 14:16.776
Remember when he and I
used to sit in here
and tell you stories?

14:16.877 --> 14:20.680
Your favorite was
of your great-great-
grandfather Ray Bernard,

14:20.780 --> 14:23.516
who used to search
for pirate treasure.

14:23.617 --> 14:25.986
They all thought he was crazy
to buy that plot of land,

14:26.087 --> 14:29.056
<i>but he was convinced</i>
<i>that under the property</i>

14:29.156 --> 14:33.860
<i>was the treasure of notorious</i>
<i>pirate Silver-Tooth Sally.</i>

14:35.562 --> 14:37.164
<i>Seven days a week</i>
<i>he dug in the dirt,</i>

14:37.265 --> 14:38.865
<i>looking</i>
<i>for the long-lost jewel.</i>

14:38.965 --> 14:42.434
<i>And then one day,</i>
<i>he never came back.</i>

14:42.534 --> 14:44.371
<i>Some wondered if he'd found</i>
<i>he sapphire</i>

14:44.470 --> 14:47.140
<i>and just left</i>
<i>his old life behind him,</i>

14:47.240 --> 14:51.877
<i>but others wondered</i>
<i>if he met with an accident</i>
<i>while digging.</i>

14:51.977 --> 14:56.116
Either way, neither he
or the sapphire
have ever been found.

14:57.883 --> 15:02.088
Don't you think
I'm a little too old
for these stories now, Mom?

15:02.188 --> 15:04.124
Maybe our family's
just cursed.

15:04.224 --> 15:06.326
No, no, hey.

15:06.425 --> 15:08.294
We've just had a string
of bad luck,

15:08.394 --> 15:11.796
which means we're due
for some good luck soon.

15:29.348 --> 15:32.051
Kylie! Does your dad
still have
that metal detector?

15:40.391 --> 15:43.261
- All this land used to belong to your family?
- Yeah.

15:43.361 --> 15:47.131
My great-great grandmother
sold it after her husband
disappeared.

15:47.231 --> 15:53.071
- All right. Let's say it is
real, this Sapphire of...
- Savoy?

15:53.171 --> 15:55.505
Savoy.

15:55.605 --> 15:58.209
It's been gone for, like,
hundreds of years.

15:58.309 --> 16:03.014
Do you really think we're going
to find it just digging around
in the dirt?

16:03.114 --> 16:04.680
Look. If you don't want
to do this...

16:04.780 --> 16:08.018
What I don't want is for you
to have to move.

16:10.287 --> 16:13.023
If we find it,
I won't have to.

16:43.685 --> 16:45.720
- What is that?
- I don't know.

16:57.033 --> 16:59.268
Oh my God, I think
I see something.

16:59.368 --> 17:00.468
What is it?

17:00.567 --> 17:02.936
- It's a...
- What?

17:07.208 --> 17:08.675
Bottle cap.

17:13.348 --> 17:16.518
It's okay,
we'll just keep... Gabe.

17:16.617 --> 17:18.186
No.
You're right.

17:18.286 --> 17:20.221
This was a stupid idea.

17:20.321 --> 17:21.955
<i>If my great-great grandfather</i>

17:22.057 --> 17:23.690
<i>couldn't find it</i>
<i>after all this time,</i>

17:23.791 --> 17:25.493
<i>what makes me think</i>
<i>that I can?</i>

17:25.592 --> 17:28.029
Don't worry.
We'll think of something.

17:28.129 --> 17:32.232
<i>I just wish he could</i>
<i>give me a sign, you know?</i>

17:34.401 --> 17:36.170
Just a hint
of where it might be.

17:41.841 --> 17:43.976
When did you get here?

17:47.147 --> 17:49.949
Aww. She doesn't like
that you're sad.

17:50.050 --> 17:51.418
Good dog.

17:51.518 --> 17:53.820
Hi, girl.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.955
Hey, I recognize this hat.

17:58.558 --> 18:00.759
This is my great-great
grandfather's hat.

18:00.859 --> 18:02.928
I've seen it
in his picture before.

18:04.197 --> 18:05.697
Where did she get this?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.436
I think she wants us
to follow her.

18:10.536 --> 18:12.171
- Let's go!
- Come on!

18:18.411 --> 18:19.945
Oh, my God! This must be

18:20.046 --> 18:21.780
where my great-great
grandfather used to dig.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.516
Did you happen to see
any blue sapphires

18:23.615 --> 18:25.117
while you were digging
in that dirt?

18:27.119 --> 18:29.087
I wonder
if she has an owner.

18:29.187 --> 18:30.388
Check out her collar.

18:32.923 --> 18:34.692
It just says Radar.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.827
No address,
no phone number, nothing.

18:36.927 --> 18:38.396
Radar, I wish
I could keep you,

18:38.497 --> 18:40.065
but Mom would kill me.

18:41.466 --> 18:45.403
I've gotta get home.
Let's try this spot
tomorrow.

18:45.504 --> 18:47.771
I mean, if she found
my great-great
grandfather's hat,

18:47.872 --> 18:50.575
maybe there's
a sapphire down there too.

18:50.674 --> 18:52.544
Well, we didn't get
the sapphire today,

18:52.643 --> 18:54.044
but she's a lot cuddlier.

18:54.145 --> 18:55.179
Yeah.

19:15.232 --> 19:16.300
What happened to you?

19:16.400 --> 19:17.834
You're absolutely filthy.

19:17.934 --> 19:19.736
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

19:19.836 --> 19:23.106
- She won't stop following me.
- Oh, sure.

19:23.206 --> 19:25.774
Gabe, look, you know
I love dogs,
but we just can't.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.645
The last thing we need
is a dog to feed
and take to the vet.

19:28.744 --> 19:30.647
But look what she found!

19:30.746 --> 19:32.382
What's that?

19:32.482 --> 19:34.716
Kylie and I went digging out
for the Sapphire of Savoy,

19:34.816 --> 19:36.386
and we...

19:36.486 --> 19:38.787
Well, Radar found this hat.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.457
And we think it might
be your great grandfather's.

19:41.558 --> 19:43.660
And if it is his,
then that means

19:43.759 --> 19:47.197
that we might be
getting closer to finding
the Sapphire of Savoy.

19:47.297 --> 19:48.431
Well...

19:48.531 --> 19:50.998
I doubt it's his hat,
but it does look a lot like it.

19:51.099 --> 19:53.035
I'll take it to Artie today.

19:53.135 --> 19:54.869
He loves old stuff like this.

19:54.969 --> 19:57.872
Now you get upstairs and get
cleaned up, young man,

19:57.972 --> 20:00.075
and say goodbye
to your friend.

20:01.276 --> 20:02.377
But Mom...

20:08.584 --> 20:10.219
Oh, my God!

20:10.319 --> 20:13.055
Oh... Oh, my God!

20:14.556 --> 20:16.225
I can't believe it.

20:17.824 --> 20:19.126
What is it?

20:20.827 --> 20:24.398
I think you found
the Sapphire of Savoy.

20:31.972 --> 20:34.841
Hey! Debbie!
What brings you in?

20:34.941 --> 20:36.677
I'm here to see Chief.

20:36.776 --> 20:39.580
Oh, well, just a moment.
I'll get him for you.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.148
Hey, Chief!

20:45.318 --> 20:47.953
I forgot we had
a new police chief.

20:49.888 --> 20:51.757
I'm Chief Joe.

20:51.857 --> 20:53.926
Joe Chief.

20:54.027 --> 20:56.329
I mean, I'm Chief Ramey.

20:57.564 --> 21:01.201
He's from Miami.
He got a big award there for heroism.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.837
I Google things!

21:05.771 --> 21:07.540
What can I do for you...?

21:07.641 --> 21:09.376
- Uh, Debbie.
- Debbie.

21:09.476 --> 21:13.579
Well, the kids were out
digging around that property
that my grandma donated

21:13.679 --> 21:16.248
and they found this.

21:18.983 --> 21:20.219
I don't believe it.

21:20.319 --> 21:22.854
- It-it can't be.
- Can't be what?

21:22.954 --> 21:24.956
What is it?

21:25.724 --> 21:28.527
It's the Sapphire of Savoy.

21:28.627 --> 21:29.961
- Uh...
- Um...

21:30.062 --> 21:32.164
Okay...
long story short,

21:32.264 --> 21:35.200
a pirate
named Silver-Tooth Sally

21:35.301 --> 21:38.637
stole a famous jewel,
the Sapphire of Savoy,

21:38.737 --> 21:43.508
and it was rumored
that she hid it
off the coast of Dunedin.

21:43.608 --> 21:44.808
But I found it!

21:44.908 --> 21:48.546
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, she did.

21:48.646 --> 21:49.880
Cute dog.

21:49.980 --> 21:52.283
Now look. I don't want
to burst your bubble.

21:52.383 --> 21:56.688
I mean, regardless,
this looks very cool,

21:56.788 --> 22:00.391
- this Sapphire of McCoy.
- Savoy.

22:00.491 --> 22:02.527
Savoy.

22:02.627 --> 22:05.029
But the odds of you finding
something like this,

22:05.129 --> 22:06.631
if it even exists...

22:07.398 --> 22:09.533
I hate saying
something like this,

22:09.633 --> 22:12.102
but don't you think
it's a little bit more likely

22:12.202 --> 22:14.671
that someone hid
some fake sapphire there

22:14.771 --> 22:16.340
just to play a mean joke?

22:18.542 --> 22:19.643
I mean...

22:20.410 --> 22:23.413
It is a famous legend here,
like you guys said.

22:23.513 --> 22:27.184
Doesn't hurt to check.
I mean, you're not busy.

22:27.284 --> 22:29.952
- Not in this town.
- True enough.

22:30.053 --> 22:31.822
We should call Artie.
He would know.

22:31.921 --> 22:33.323
- Artie?
- Um...

22:33.423 --> 22:36.093
He runs the pirate museum
down the block.

22:36.193 --> 22:39.028
He used to be
a professor in Tampa.

22:39.128 --> 22:41.497
Or was it Tallahassee?

22:41.597 --> 22:43.032
It was somewhere.

22:43.132 --> 22:45.835
Anyway, he specializes
in this kind of thing.

22:45.934 --> 22:47.570
All right, then.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.105
Let's call Artie.

22:49.205 --> 22:52.141
Just don't get
your hopes up, okay?

23:00.549 --> 23:01.751
Artie...

23:01.851 --> 23:04.153
the displays
haven't changed here
in 30 years.

23:04.253 --> 23:08.022
I don't have anything
to change them with.

23:08.123 --> 23:11.559
Artifacts, at least
those worth seeing,
cost money.

23:11.659 --> 23:13.027
Now, maybe if I had
a benefactor

23:13.128 --> 23:14.462
- who could donate...
- Oh, Artie.

23:14.562 --> 23:16.798
Nobody is going to donate
any expensive artifacts

23:16.897 --> 23:18.500
to a silly pirate museum.

23:19.467 --> 23:20.468
Plastic!

23:21.902 --> 23:25.573
Oh, Artie, I'm sorry.
That was out of line.

23:25.673 --> 23:27.776
But we gotta do something!

23:27.876 --> 23:31.945
This town is dying.

23:33.381 --> 23:37.651
How-- what if we just...
re-labeled a few things?

23:37.751 --> 23:38.819
Re-labeled?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.754
You know,
put a spin on them.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.623
A spin?

23:42.723 --> 23:44.491
Like...

23:44.591 --> 23:46.693
not lie, but...

23:46.794 --> 23:48.262
kinda lie.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.865
Mayor, I don't think
I'd be very comfortable

23:51.964 --> 23:54.368
doing something like...

23:58.305 --> 24:01.375
Yarrrrr!
Dunedin Pirate Museum.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.411
They found what?!

24:12.819 --> 24:15.021
Well, is it the Sapphire
of Savoy or not?

24:15.121 --> 24:17.323
Well, there's
no concrete evidence

24:17.423 --> 24:20.226
that the Sapphire of Savoy
was hidden in Dunedin...

24:20.326 --> 24:22.662
even if it existed at all.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.130
Now legends are tricky...

24:24.997 --> 24:26.999
and I only deal in...

24:32.270 --> 24:33.405
facts.

24:36.842 --> 24:40.645
And the fact is, this here is
a genuine and flawless sapphire!

24:40.745 --> 24:41.880
Really?

24:41.979 --> 24:43.715
Really?

24:43.815 --> 24:44.916
- Aww.
- Good girl.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.953
I must confess,
I am absolutely stunned!

24:48.053 --> 24:49.254
Oh, my God!

24:49.354 --> 24:51.989
Oh, boy, you really
saved this town!

24:52.090 --> 24:53.458
We did?

24:53.558 --> 24:55.260
- Yes!
- You bet!

24:55.360 --> 24:57.128
You just found
pirate treasure!

24:57.229 --> 24:58.829
- We need to call
the local news...
- Yeah!

24:58.929 --> 25:03.701
No, no, the national news!
The-- No, global!
The whole world!

25:03.801 --> 25:05.135
Okay, with this sapphire,

25:05.236 --> 25:07.137
I can put Dunedin
back on the map!

25:07.238 --> 25:08.839
Tourists will start
coming back!

25:08.939 --> 25:11.242
We-we can do
a-a-a pirate festival
like we used to do!

25:11.342 --> 25:12.776
- Yeah! Yeah!
- You'll love that.

25:12.877 --> 25:14.011
Oh, that's a good idea!

25:14.111 --> 25:15.980
I wonder if I still
have my old corset.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.950
I was quite the saucy
bar wench back in my day.

25:20.050 --> 25:23.787
Yes! A festival celebrating
this discovery is exactly
what we need!

25:23.888 --> 25:25.155
Don't forget
about Radar.

25:25.256 --> 25:27.690
She's the real hero.
She found the sapphire.

25:29.225 --> 25:31.060
That's one heck of a dog
your kid has right there.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.595
Yes.

25:32.695 --> 25:35.398
- Yes, it is.
-  - Yeah, she's a good girl.

25:50.346 --> 25:53.750
<i>Thank you. Thank you</i>
<i>so very much. Thank you.</i>

25:53.850 --> 25:57.219
<i>Welcome to a very, very,</i>
<i>very special afternoon.</i>

25:57.319 --> 26:01.557
<i>I, of course, am mayor</i>
<i>Sebastian Fleming,</i>
<i>but you already know that.</i>

26:01.657 --> 26:03.292
Whatcha doin', Doc?

26:03.392 --> 26:05.360
I'm cross-referencing
algorithms,

26:05.460 --> 26:09.731
statistics and odds
of treasure locations
throughout America

26:09.831 --> 26:14.670
to determine what route
that mangy mutt may have taken.

26:14.770 --> 26:18.907
With that data, I'll input it
into the circumnavigator

26:19.008 --> 26:21.044
and should be able to make
an educated guess

26:21.176 --> 26:23.711
as to the location of Dog.

26:23.811 --> 26:25.413
Huh?

26:26.681 --> 26:27.815
Oh, forget it.

26:27.915 --> 26:30.151
I doubt your feeble mind
can grasp

26:30.251 --> 26:33.854
the intricacies
of geographical statistics

26:33.955 --> 26:35.556
and plausibility
calculations.

26:35.656 --> 26:36.924
What?!

26:37.692 --> 26:39.894
I'm trying to find
this stupid dog,

26:39.995 --> 26:41.228
which is more
than what you're doing,

26:41.329 --> 26:44.932
you thick-witted,
imbecilic addle pate!

26:45.033 --> 26:47.602
Oh... Okay.

26:50.570 --> 26:54.808
Hey, Doc?
Is that the same--

26:54.908 --> 26:56.109
is that the same--

26:56.209 --> 26:59.746
I'm working here, Dobbins!
Working!

27:00.714 --> 27:03.917
<i>Dunedin is</i>
<i>a town rich in history.</i>

27:04.018 --> 27:06.419
<i>We were once known</i>
<i>for being one</i>
<i>of the most notorious</i>

27:06.519 --> 27:10.657
<i>pirate havens in the region.</i>
<i>Argh!</i>

27:12.258 --> 27:14.427
And we continue
that tradition today,

27:14.527 --> 27:16.630
albeit in a more
family-friendly way

27:16.730 --> 27:19.798
by having one
of the most toured
pirate museums

27:19.898 --> 27:22.568
in all of Florida.

27:22.668 --> 27:25.005
We also used to host
an annual pirate festival,

27:25.105 --> 27:26.338
which I am very pleased
to say,

27:26.438 --> 27:29.241
we will be doing
again very soon.

27:29.341 --> 27:32.211
Piracy was so prevalent
in Dunedin back in the day

27:32.311 --> 27:33.879
that gold doubloons

27:33.979 --> 27:36.649
are still found
among our beaches.

27:37.750 --> 27:40.285
But I must confess,
we never thought
a treasure like this

27:40.386 --> 27:42.154
would be discovered
on our shores.

27:42.254 --> 27:43.922
Ladies and gentlemen,

27:44.024 --> 27:46.126
I present to you...

27:46.225 --> 27:48.292
the Sapphire of Savoy!

27:57.069 --> 27:58.137
Yes... Starting today,

27:58.236 --> 27:59.604
we will be showcasing
this beauty

27:59.704 --> 28:02.807
at our world-renowned
pirate museum!

28:07.378 --> 28:10.115
Which one of you found
the Sapphire of Savoy first?

28:10.214 --> 28:11.716
Neither, actually.

28:11.816 --> 28:14.352
- It was Radar.
- Can you believe it?
It was the boy's dog!

28:14.452 --> 28:16.319
The boy's dog
found the sapphire!

28:16.420 --> 28:18.689
Now that is what I call
a man's best friend!

28:22.826 --> 28:24.861
Uh...

28:24.961 --> 28:27.564
Doc, I really think
you need to look at this.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.167
What is it, Dobbins?!
What is it?!

28:29.266 --> 28:30.901
<i>Actually, I found it...</i>

28:31.002 --> 28:32.836
- The dog.
- It's Dog!

28:34.138 --> 28:36.907
Right in front of you
the whole time
and you didn't even notice!

28:37.008 --> 28:39.010
- Well, I-I--
- Shh!

28:39.110 --> 28:41.511
And you mom let you keep him?

28:41.611 --> 28:43.080
Well, if no owner
steps forward,

28:43.180 --> 28:44.680
you bet I'll let him
keep the dog.

28:44.780 --> 28:46.615
Well, listen,
after what she found,

28:46.716 --> 28:49.318
if you guys don't want her,
I'll certainly take her!

28:49.418 --> 28:50.553
<i>- Right?</i>
- She's mine,

28:50.653 --> 28:52.788
- you yappy local yokel!
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>

28:52.888 --> 28:56.425
It must be said
that these kids, and, um...

28:56.525 --> 28:58.294
- Radar.
- Radar, yes.

28:58.394 --> 28:59.829
I'm sorry,
Radar, of course,

28:59.929 --> 29:03.532
they have breathed
new life into Dunedin!

29:03.632 --> 29:07.003
And we welcome everyone
to come visit our town,

29:07.104 --> 29:08.671
see the Sapphire of Savoy,

29:08.771 --> 29:12.108
and have lunch
at the Wild Iris CafÃ©,

29:12.208 --> 29:15.144
owned by our very own
Debbie Iris,

29:15.243 --> 29:18.147
the mother of Gabe here.

29:18.246 --> 29:19.380
So, who knows?

29:19.481 --> 29:21.382
You might even find
your own treasure

29:21.483 --> 29:24.819
on the beaches
of beautiful Dunedin.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.728
<i>Group photo! Group photo!</i>

29:38.333 --> 29:40.201
Come, Dobbins.

29:40.300 --> 29:44.038
We must traverse to that
nonentity mildewy town

29:44.139 --> 29:46.273
to retrieve that
which is ours!

29:46.373 --> 29:47.574
I don't know, Doc.

29:47.674 --> 29:49.643
Seems like
a really nice place,

29:49.743 --> 29:52.312
and the pirate museum
seems kinda cool!

29:52.412 --> 29:53.982
Shut up, Dobbins.

29:54.082 --> 29:55.649
We have a dog to catch.

29:57.152 --> 30:00.654
And a sapphire to pilfer.

30:00.754 --> 30:02.389
Here you go, Radar.

30:04.858 --> 30:07.794
I don't care what you say,
vanilla's the best flavor.

30:10.197 --> 30:11.664
Looks like Radar
agrees with you.

30:11.764 --> 30:13.499
Aww...

30:15.968 --> 30:17.470
Is that your mom?

30:17.570 --> 30:20.473
- It just says "Yes."
- Yes, what?

30:23.309 --> 30:25.145
"Yes, I agree with you."

30:25.245 --> 30:27.713
What? Who's sending this?

30:29.448 --> 30:31.450
Well, you did just say
Radar agrees that vanilla
is the best.

30:31.551 --> 30:33.519
Yeah, right.

30:45.363 --> 30:47.033
What's your problem?

30:54.873 --> 30:56.875
Did she just...

30:56.975 --> 30:59.045
No! She couldn't have...

30:59.145 --> 31:00.478
Could she?

31:03.647 --> 31:04.849
- You gonna to get it?
- You get it!

31:04.949 --> 31:07.551
Heck, no! You get it!
It's your phone!

31:16.161 --> 31:19.363
It says,
"Yes. I did text."

31:19.463 --> 31:22.033
Nu-uh. Someone's
pulling a prank.

31:22.133 --> 31:24.102
Okay. Forget
the phone for now.

31:24.202 --> 31:25.569
If she can text us,

31:25.669 --> 31:27.972
then she can
understand us, right?

31:29.174 --> 31:31.674
Radar, smile!

31:31.774 --> 31:33.476
What is she?

31:33.576 --> 31:35.145
- I don't know.
- Ask her.

31:35.246 --> 31:36.981
Why is it always me?

31:41.085 --> 31:44.054
She says she's bionic.

31:44.154 --> 31:46.856
Bionic? What's that?

31:48.158 --> 31:50.327
Whoa!

31:50.426 --> 31:52.428
Oh, my God.

31:52.528 --> 31:54.797
My dog is a superhero!

31:54.898 --> 31:56.367
Come here, girl!

31:56.466 --> 31:57.934
And that's okay?

31:58.035 --> 32:02.938
Your dog can text and open up
and this isn't weird at all?

32:03.039 --> 32:06.441
No, it's not weird!
It's freakin' awesome!

32:06.541 --> 32:10.980
All right, yes,
having a "super dog"
is cool and all,

32:11.080 --> 32:13.116
but think about it.

32:13.216 --> 32:15.484
I doubt she was born that way.

32:15.584 --> 32:17.853
She was made that way.

32:17.953 --> 32:19.155
What's your point?

32:19.255 --> 32:20.422
My point is,

32:20.522 --> 32:22.392
if you made a bionic dog,

32:22.491 --> 32:24.626
wouldn't you want it back?

32:26.396 --> 32:29.463
Now that disobedient monster
has escaped us.

32:29.563 --> 32:31.799
We need to find something,
a vehicle of some sort

32:31.899 --> 32:34.835
that's large enough
to contain her
once we catch her.

32:34.936 --> 32:36.405
A van maybe,
or a truck of some sort.

32:36.504 --> 32:38.040
- Doc...
- Something large enough...

32:38.140 --> 32:39.740
- Doc.
- What?!

32:41.742 --> 32:44.146
Oh...

32:46.747 --> 32:48.984
I didn't take
high school shop
for nothing.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.821
Act like it's yours.

32:58.959 --> 33:00.660
Doc, get in.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.562
See if there's any keys.

33:03.630 --> 33:07.134
Oh, the trusty clipean left
the keys inside.

33:07.234 --> 33:08.969
You drive, Dobbins.

33:10.870 --> 33:12.173
We have a new mission now.

33:12.273 --> 33:15.909
First, we retrieve Dog,
and then the sapphire.

33:16.010 --> 33:18.645
Yeah, but the kid has the dog
and the town has the sapphire.

33:18.745 --> 33:22.049
Dog will always
be loyal to her creator.

33:22.149 --> 33:23.451
And with her help,

33:23.550 --> 33:25.517
fetching the sapphire
from these village idiots

33:25.617 --> 33:27.753
will be elementary at best.

33:29.255 --> 33:31.657
Ah, there's the museum.

33:35.627 --> 33:38.164
Find somewhere inconspicuous
for us to park.

33:39.432 --> 33:40.966
Perfect place, Dobbins.

33:54.779 --> 33:56.948
It's
about 7,000 square feet
on the roof.

33:57.049 --> 33:59.517
- Hello, welcome to Dunedin.
- Thanks!

33:59.617 --> 34:01.487
Naturally, of course,
the sapphire itself

34:01.586 --> 34:04.156
will be in a-- probably be
in a protective case,

34:04.256 --> 34:05.523
- and under armed guard.
- Hmm.

34:05.623 --> 34:07.292
This will, no doubt,
be a challenge.

34:07.393 --> 34:08.960
Hmm...

34:10.029 --> 34:10.962
My God, Dobbins!

34:11.063 --> 34:12.764
This is going to be
easier than I thought.

34:12.864 --> 34:13.999
Uh, Doc?

34:14.099 --> 34:16.402
In fact, I'm feeling
a bit crestfallen.

34:16.502 --> 34:18.703
Uh, Doc.

34:18.803 --> 34:20.637
I really wanted
a bit of a challenge.

34:20.737 --> 34:22.974
- Doc.
- What is it, Dobbins?!

34:32.216 --> 34:33.683
Oh.

34:33.784 --> 34:35.186
What are we going to do?

34:35.286 --> 34:37.821
We're going to quickly
and quietly go back
to the camper.

34:37.921 --> 34:39.790
Don't make any eye contact,
keep your head down,

34:39.890 --> 34:42.260
and distort your face
so you won't be recognized.

34:51.101 --> 34:53.470
I can feel people
looking at us.
Are they looking at us?

34:53.569 --> 34:55.571
- No one is looking at us.
- Are you sure?

34:55.671 --> 34:58.475
If they're looking,
it's because they're seeing
a grown man crying.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.310
- I can't help it.
- Cease your whimpering.

35:00.410 --> 35:01.577
- I'm trying!
- Oh!

35:01.677 --> 35:03.280
Pull yourself together,
you miserable sack!

35:05.549 --> 35:06.916
Get in!

35:12.189 --> 35:14.558
- Oooh! Look!
- What?! What is it?!

35:14.657 --> 35:17.460
- Pie!
- Pie?! You ingrate!

35:17.560 --> 35:19.428
Ow! What?

35:19.528 --> 35:23.665
And look
who's serving it!

35:23.765 --> 35:28.504
Oh, yeah. Hey, hey,
didn't we see her on TV?

35:28.603 --> 35:30.473
- She's the boy's mother.
- Oh.

35:30.573 --> 35:34.577
All we have to do
is follow her home
and she'll lead us to Dog.

35:34.676 --> 35:38.080
Then, Dog will help us
get our sapphire.

36:33.467 --> 36:36.236
Well, this is
a nice surprise.

36:36.336 --> 36:37.638
How can I help you, Chief?

36:37.737 --> 36:39.339
Call me Joe, please.

36:39.439 --> 36:41.107
Joe.

36:41.207 --> 36:44.243
Well, I heard you have
the best key lime pie
this side of Key West,

36:44.343 --> 36:46.878
so I thought I should
stop by and give it a try.

36:46.979 --> 36:50.216
Mm. Great.
You prefer indoors
or outdoors?

36:52.684 --> 36:54.487
<i>Al fresco,</i> please.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.155
Right this way.

37:00.393 --> 37:03.262
"This beautiful museum
is housed..."

37:04.497 --> 37:05.697
Could you please
show some initiative

37:05.797 --> 37:08.067
and help with surveillance?
Dobbins?

37:08.167 --> 37:09.700
Dobbins,
what are you reading?!

37:09.800 --> 37:12.070
It's a pamphlet
about the pirate museum.

37:12.170 --> 37:14.072
- Oh.
- Yeah, I printed it out
before we left.

37:14.172 --> 37:17.342
- It's actually
pretty cool. Yeah.
- This is great. May I see it?

37:22.746 --> 37:23.881
This is so empowering.

37:23.982 --> 37:26.850
She has no idea
we're watching her.

37:31.022 --> 37:34.259
Yeah. I mean, this is better
than anything in Key West.

37:34.359 --> 37:36.228
Well, thanks, Joe.

37:36.328 --> 37:37.927
This one's on the house.

37:38.795 --> 37:40.965
Hey, do you ever get out?

37:42.366 --> 37:44.468
I-I mean, for dinner.

37:44.568 --> 37:46.270
Uh, not really.

37:46.370 --> 37:48.539
Taking care of Gabe
and running the diner,

37:48.639 --> 37:51.308
it's just not a lot
of time, you know.

37:51.408 --> 37:54.078
And Gabe's father is...

37:54.178 --> 37:57.747
He passed away
a few years ago.
Afghanistan.

37:59.617 --> 38:00.917
I'm so sorry.

38:01.018 --> 38:04.255
Yeah, it was
a difficult time,
especially for Gabe.

38:05.854 --> 38:09.292
I'm sorry. What were we
talking about?

38:09.392 --> 38:11.561
Um,

38:11.661 --> 38:15.431
I... I was just wanting
to know...

38:15.531 --> 38:16.966
I mean...

38:18.268 --> 38:20.370
I understand
if you don't want to...

38:20.470 --> 38:21.471
I understand...

38:21.571 --> 38:23.172
I mean...

38:24.140 --> 38:27.443
Ahem. Would you like to go
to dinner with me?

38:27.543 --> 38:30.980
Oh! Um...

38:31.080 --> 38:34.983
Sorry, that was awful timing.
Never mind, I'm...

38:35.083 --> 38:36.451
Sure!

38:38.886 --> 38:40.255
- Really?
- Mm.

38:41.690 --> 38:43.425
Uh, great.

38:47.529 --> 38:51.199
Uh, dinner tomorrow,
Casa Tina?

38:51.300 --> 38:54.869
You can fill me in
on the whose
and wheres of the town.

38:54.970 --> 38:56.271
Yeah, yeah, all right.

38:56.371 --> 38:58.774
Just let me see if I can find
a babysitter for Gabe.

38:58.873 --> 39:00.309
With all these wanted
posters around,

39:00.409 --> 39:03.044
it just has me a little
paranoid, you know?

39:03.144 --> 39:06.647
I can ask Ethel.
I'm sure she'd be
more than happy to help.

39:06.747 --> 39:09.984
- Really?
- Sure.

39:10.084 --> 39:13.054
Come on.
It'll do you good.

39:13.154 --> 39:17.124
- Meet me at seven?
- Sounds like a plan.

39:18.492 --> 39:20.261
Okay.

39:25.266 --> 39:27.068
Hey, Larry.
Dishes are washed.

39:27.168 --> 39:29.369
Napkins, salt and pepper
re-stocked for you.

39:29.469 --> 39:32.405
Can you hold down the fort
until Ruth arrives?
She's running a little late.

39:32.505 --> 39:34.907
- Sure thing, Deb.
Anything to help.
- Thanks.

39:36.276 --> 39:38.844
- It's a cop.
- Ah, yes.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.347
A provincial lawman.

39:40.447 --> 39:42.982
Looks like he walked out
of a hacky movie of the week.

39:43.083 --> 39:46.653
I'm sure he's
a bona fide
Clint Eastwood.

39:46.753 --> 39:49.589
And, hey,
be careful going home.

39:49.689 --> 39:53.226
I saw a bunch of flyers
about some escaped nut jobs
out there.

39:53.326 --> 39:56.730
It's just a short walk home.
I'm sure I can survive that.

39:56.830 --> 39:58.530
All right, bye-bye.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.205
There she goes.
Follow her.

40:16.548 --> 40:17.949
Why can't you come over?

40:18.050 --> 40:19.884
My mom says
as soon as I'm done
cleaning my room,

40:19.985 --> 40:21.353
I can head back.

40:21.453 --> 40:25.090
That's gonna
take you hours
to clean that mess.

40:25.190 --> 40:29.127
We need to form a game plan
on how to hide Radar's identity.

40:29.227 --> 40:31.963
<i>Sorry, but I haven't cleaned</i>
<i>my room in two days.</i>

40:32.063 --> 40:35.266
That's only two days'
worth of mess?

40:35.366 --> 40:38.469
Dang, and I thought
girls were clean.

40:38.569 --> 40:40.037
Shut up.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.140
Follow her closely,
Dobbins.

40:42.240 --> 40:46.411
But not too closely, else
we shall arouse suspicion.

40:46.511 --> 40:49.847
Ah, okay.
Now what?

40:49.981 --> 40:54.117
Reconnaissance, Dobbins.
Reconnaissance.

40:55.951 --> 40:57.254
What do you see
through the binos, Doc?

40:57.354 --> 41:01.491
I see the thermal images
of two people--

41:01.591 --> 41:03.960
an adult, and a child...

41:04.828 --> 41:06.396
and a canine.

41:07.431 --> 41:10.167
I wonder if it's
Lady Cicely Von Finklesworth?

41:13.069 --> 41:14.937
I'm so glad your mom
decided not to move.

41:15.038 --> 41:19.042
Me too. Oh!
Some TV show people
called her

41:19.142 --> 41:21.311
and they want to do
a reality show

41:21.411 --> 41:23.279
<i>where they dig</i>
<i>where we found the sapphire</i>

41:23.379 --> 41:25.815
to see if there's any more
treasure down there.

41:25.915 --> 41:27.983
They think
since there's a sapphire,

41:28.083 --> 41:29.919
there's gotta be more
treasure to find.

41:30.019 --> 41:31.953
Time is of the essence.

41:32.054 --> 41:34.290
We strike now.

41:35.191 --> 41:36.992
Broad daylight again?

41:37.092 --> 41:38.761
Oh, the prison break
was a fluke.

41:38.861 --> 41:42.898
Besides, this time I have
an even better trick
up my sleeve.

41:51.339 --> 41:54.843
Oh, my God, you're going
to be on TV?!
That's so cool!

41:54.943 --> 41:56.778
Can I be on TV?

41:56.878 --> 41:59.647
Sure, if she decides
to do it.

41:59.747 --> 42:01.115
They want to put a spin on it

42:01.216 --> 42:03.351
to where the treasure is cursed
or haunted or something.

42:03.451 --> 42:05.520
Is it?

42:05.620 --> 42:09.991
No, but they think it'd be
more interesting that way.

42:10.091 --> 42:13.228
She thinks it's weird
to make up stuff.

42:13.328 --> 42:15.063
<i>She doesn't know</i>
<i>if she's going to do it.</i>

42:15.163 --> 42:18.499
And it is pretty lame
to make up ghosts.

42:18.599 --> 42:21.869
I'll pretend to be afraid
of ghosts if I get to be on TV.

42:21.970 --> 42:23.570
I don't care.

42:23.670 --> 42:26.440
I'm worried about Radar
getting too much press.

42:26.540 --> 42:27.808
The more she's on TV,

42:27.908 --> 42:31.612
the bigger the odds
of her creators
coming and getting her.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.516
Now, if anyone stops us,

42:35.616 --> 42:38.919
just say we're investigating
a report of Japanese murder
hornets in the area.

42:39.019 --> 42:40.955
Got it.
What about the kids?

42:41.054 --> 42:44.993
What are we gonna do
when they see us climbing
through the window?

42:45.092 --> 42:46.492
Gas 'em.

42:48.528 --> 42:51.999
Oh, fear not, Dobbins.
It just renders them
unconscious long enough

42:52.098 --> 42:55.201
for us to get Dog back
and retrieve the sapphire.

42:57.036 --> 42:58.337
Right there.

43:13.020 --> 43:13.920
Perfect.

43:15.186 --> 43:17.322
- Was that Radar growling?
- Yeah.

43:17.422 --> 43:19.992
I can't do heights, Doc.
I just can't!

43:20.091 --> 43:21.826
I just can't!

43:21.927 --> 43:23.996
You're literally
two feet off the ground!

43:24.095 --> 43:25.564
Oh, come on, Dobbins!

43:25.664 --> 43:28.000
We don't have time
for your acrophobia.
Get down!

43:28.099 --> 43:30.036
There's spiders too?

43:30.135 --> 43:32.671
That's arachnophobia,
you ninny!

43:32.771 --> 43:34.806
I think she hears something.

43:36.074 --> 43:37.742
Would you just get down
and let me do it?!

43:37.842 --> 43:39.578
I can't move.
I'm too scared.

43:39.678 --> 43:42.379
You're afraid to go up,
and you're afraid to come down!

43:42.479 --> 43:45.082
Do not yell at me.
You are just making it worse.

43:54.658 --> 43:55.726
What is it, Radar?

44:05.402 --> 44:08.572
She says her creators
are outside,
and they're bad people!

44:08.672 --> 44:09.873
<i>Well, what do I do?</i>

44:09.975 --> 44:11.407
Call the cops, genius!

44:11.507 --> 44:13.109
But if the cops find out
she's bionic,

44:13.209 --> 44:14.944
they might take her away!

44:18.181 --> 44:20.750
Look, Doc! It's her!

44:20.850 --> 44:24.153
Excellent! She senses
her master's presence.

44:24.253 --> 44:26.255
Come here, girl. That's right.

44:26.356 --> 44:29.359
You know who you belong to.
Now come to your master.

44:31.294 --> 44:32.963
What are you doing?

44:36.633 --> 44:38.667
Ow! Ow!

44:40.168 --> 44:42.904
No! No!

44:43.006 --> 44:44.239
No!

44:45.907 --> 44:46.875
Hmm.

44:53.682 --> 44:55.517
Get the ladder,
and let's get outta here.

45:02.591 --> 45:05.460
<i>Gabe? Gabe!</i>

45:05.560 --> 45:08.763
- Come on! Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

45:08.863 --> 45:10.531
Radar, what happened?!

45:13.434 --> 45:15.903
Oh, my God!
Radar! Come on!

45:18.472 --> 45:21.275
Are you there? Gabe!

45:22.643 --> 45:25.746
Phew! That was close.
Radar ran them off.

45:25.846 --> 45:28.816
- You think they'll be back?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

45:28.916 --> 45:31.419
But I do know...

45:31.519 --> 45:34.554
is I'm not gonna give up
Radar without a fight.

45:34.654 --> 45:38.059
And I'll never let them
take you. You're family now.

45:40.794 --> 45:42.063
What did she say?

45:42.163 --> 45:44.297
She says that we're
her family too.

45:44.397 --> 45:45.832
Aww.

45:51.571 --> 45:53.506
Well,
that didn't go well.

45:53.606 --> 45:55.909
What an astute observation,
Dobbins.

45:56.010 --> 46:00.047
I had no idea you held
such vast powers
of perception.

46:00.147 --> 46:02.581
Maybe we can go back
with some treats.

46:02.681 --> 46:05.751
Hmph. Only if they're laced
with strychnine.

46:05.851 --> 46:07.120
Turn here, Dobbins.

46:07.219 --> 46:10.556
I need a moment
to soothe my nerves
and re-strategize.

46:16.029 --> 46:20.699
That Judas Iscariot, mangy,
good-for-nothing mutt!

46:20.799 --> 46:22.468
How dare she betray me?!

46:22.568 --> 46:24.603
I told you
we should've given her
a real name.

46:24.703 --> 46:25.871
Shut up.

46:26.839 --> 46:29.241
Doc! Doc,
someone's headed
this way!

46:29.341 --> 46:30.708
Oh, my goodness.

46:30.808 --> 46:33.578
A local yokel who is taking
a stroll on a public beach.

46:33.678 --> 46:35.147
Whatever shall we do,
Dobbins?

46:35.246 --> 46:37.015
No, but what if he
recognizes us?

46:39.017 --> 46:40.451
Here.

46:42.955 --> 46:44.622
Good afternoon.

46:46.024 --> 46:47.592
Good afternoon.

46:48.860 --> 46:51.796
Dr. Vanhook, I presume?

46:51.896 --> 46:53.031
And you must be Dobbins.

46:56.534 --> 46:57.635
Run!

46:58.402 --> 46:59.603
Get out of my way!

46:59.703 --> 47:02.672
But where
are we running? But--

47:02.773 --> 47:05.275
To the sea, Dobbins!
To the sea!

47:05.375 --> 47:06.743
Uh, wait--

47:08.946 --> 47:09.913
But it's cold!

47:10.014 --> 47:11.648
I want to make a deal!

47:15.987 --> 47:17.420
What kind of deal?

47:18.321 --> 47:21.092
I'm assuming you're here
for the sapphire,

47:21.192 --> 47:24.061
and seeing as how you tried
to break into that kid's home--

47:24.162 --> 47:26.097
yes, I have been
following you--

47:26.197 --> 47:29.032
I'm assuming you were planning
on kidnapping the kid

47:29.132 --> 47:31.400
in exchange for the jewel.

47:31.500 --> 47:33.469
Actually,
we were just try--

47:34.603 --> 47:36.973
Who are you,
and what do you want?

47:38.975 --> 47:40.810
I'm the Mayor,

47:40.910 --> 47:43.213
and what I want is out.

47:43.312 --> 47:45.148
Go on.

47:45.248 --> 47:46.582
I have a plan,

47:46.682 --> 47:51.353
a plan that could be
beneficial to both parties.

47:51.453 --> 47:56.058
I'm intrigued.
Please. Come into my office.

48:12.907 --> 48:17.378
- Good morning, Miami!
- Good morning, Ethel.

48:17.478 --> 48:18.613
What is this?

48:18.713 --> 48:20.582
Breakfast.

48:20.682 --> 48:22.952
What did you do?
What do you want?

48:23.052 --> 48:24.751
Nothing! Geez!

48:24.852 --> 48:27.588
I've raised five boys.
When you do something nice,

48:27.688 --> 48:32.227
it's because you did
something bad,
or you want something.

48:32.327 --> 48:34.162
Now I can't imagine you
doing anything bad,

48:34.262 --> 48:36.763
so I'm going to go
with you want something.

48:36.864 --> 48:39.267
It's called
being nice, Ethel.

48:39.366 --> 48:41.069
Mm-hmm.

48:44.538 --> 48:46.040
Okay, then.

48:50.211 --> 48:52.678
You hear anything
about those escaped convicts?

48:52.778 --> 48:54.281
Nope.

48:54.380 --> 48:56.950
Hm. Okay.

48:59.919 --> 49:01.088
Oh, one more thing.

49:01.188 --> 49:03.257
Here it comes.

49:03.357 --> 49:05.125
What do you want?

49:05.225 --> 49:06.525
Nothing.

49:06.626 --> 49:09.862
I don't want anything!

49:15.668 --> 49:19.272
It's Debbie. She needs
a babysitter tonight
for Gabe.

49:19.372 --> 49:21.873
Why on earth
would Debbie need a--

49:21.974 --> 49:25.344
Oh, you and Debbie!

49:25.443 --> 49:27.113
So? Will you do it?

49:27.213 --> 49:31.083
Of course. That poor girl
could use a night out.

49:31.183 --> 49:35.487
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you!
- Okay, okay, okay...

49:35.587 --> 49:39.025
- Just save that for your date!
- Thank you so much!

49:39.125 --> 49:41.193
Go on.

49:43.495 --> 49:45.164
They're obviously bad guys,
like Radar said,

49:45.264 --> 49:48.432
else they would've just
knocked on the door
and asked for her back.

49:48.532 --> 49:52.170
Well, whoever it was,
they'll definitely be back.

49:52.270 --> 49:53.804
But why did they make her?

49:58.343 --> 49:59.510
Doubloons?

50:00.345 --> 50:02.813
That's it! They must have
sent her here
for pirate treasure,

50:02.913 --> 50:06.117
and she found the sapphire.

50:07.419 --> 50:10.388
This is getting
bigger and bigger.

50:10.487 --> 50:12.157
Maybe we should
call the cops.

50:12.257 --> 50:14.125
No! If they find out
she's bionic,

50:14.225 --> 50:18.395
they're gonna turn her over
for the CIA to do experiments
and stuff.

50:18.494 --> 50:21.864
They're not going to let a kid
keep a bionic dog.

50:21.966 --> 50:24.834
True, but even
if we manage
to keep Radar,

50:24.934 --> 50:26.736
what if they take
the sapphire?

50:26.836 --> 50:30.140
Then the town is bust again,
and you'll have to move!

50:30.240 --> 50:32.176
Ugh! You're right.

50:32.276 --> 50:33.810
What do we do?!

50:37.381 --> 50:39.549
- Radar!
- Radar!

50:44.287 --> 50:45.587
Radar!

50:47.357 --> 50:48.890
Thank God she's bionic!

50:48.992 --> 50:51.827
You're right!
Kylie! I just got an idea!

50:51.927 --> 50:54.663
But we're gonna have
to wait 'til tonight.

51:01.371 --> 51:04.539
Ugh! Radar,
that's totally impossible!

51:04.639 --> 51:06.009
You're using a cheat code!

51:09.245 --> 51:11.513
That's so unfair!

51:11.613 --> 51:13.315
Gabe, can I talk
to you for a minute?

51:13.415 --> 51:15.217
Sure, Mom. What's up?

51:15.317 --> 51:17.219
Kylie, can you
give us a moment?

51:17.319 --> 51:19.920
Sure. You look
really pretty.

51:20.022 --> 51:21.756
Oh. Thank you.

51:23.158 --> 51:24.925
Radar, you want a treat?

51:29.398 --> 51:30.798
Am I doing the wrong thing?

51:30.898 --> 51:32.134
Huh?

51:32.234 --> 51:35.937
This date. I shouldn't be
going on this date, should I?

51:36.038 --> 51:37.939
I don't know.

51:38.040 --> 51:39.806
I feel bad.

51:39.906 --> 51:43.077
Mom, I'll be fine tonight.
I'm not a baby.

51:43.177 --> 51:45.112
No, no, it's not that.
It's just I...

51:46.380 --> 51:49.417
I feel like I'm not
being faithful
to your father.

51:49.517 --> 51:52.253
Mom, don't.
Dad would want you
to be happy.

51:52.353 --> 51:54.388
And I want you
to be happy too.

51:54.488 --> 51:59.393
It's kinda weird
seeing my mom go on a date,
but I'll get used to it.

51:59.493 --> 52:01.594
Oh, you're a trooper.

52:01.694 --> 52:04.931
And Kylie was right.
You do look really pretty.

52:06.900 --> 52:08.268
Oh.

52:08.368 --> 52:09.768
She's here.

52:12.439 --> 52:13.872
- Hey!
- Hi!

52:13.973 --> 52:16.509
- Wow! You look great!
- Oh, thank you.

52:16.608 --> 52:18.411
- Hey, kids!
- Hey!

52:18.511 --> 52:23.016
Okay, so I am headed out.
Miss Ethel here is going
to babysit you.

52:23.116 --> 52:25.918
Babysit? Mom, but I'm
nearly 12 and Kylie
is here, and--

52:26.019 --> 52:27.786
Uh-uh-uh. No buts.
It's settled.

52:27.886 --> 52:29.922
There are two escaped convicts
running around here.

52:30.023 --> 52:31.491
We're not taking any chances.

52:31.623 --> 52:34.060
All right, I have my phone
if you need anything,

52:34.160 --> 52:36.428
and don't answer the door
for anyone that you don't know.

52:36.528 --> 52:41.333
Mama, they'll be fine.
If I can handle
five wild boys,

52:41.433 --> 52:43.335
- I can handle these two.
- Okay.

52:43.435 --> 52:44.836
All right. So you
just go on out...

52:44.937 --> 52:46.771
- Bye!
- ...and have fun. Go.

52:46.871 --> 52:49.208
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, bye, bye. Bye.

52:51.009 --> 52:54.012
So... Who wants
to play poker?

52:55.447 --> 52:56.914
You kids today!

52:57.015 --> 53:00.119
All about computer games
and God knows what else.

53:00.219 --> 53:05.056
What you need is some good
old-fashioned know-how. Yeah.

53:05.156 --> 53:07.458
That's what my grandfather
taught me.

53:07.558 --> 53:08.993
Hey. What have you
got for me, girl?

53:09.093 --> 53:10.962
We need to get rid of Ethel
for a while.

53:11.062 --> 53:13.564
And I'm talking way, way back,
the old chief,

53:13.663 --> 53:18.136
and I call him old
because I think he was
a friend of Abe Lincoln's.

53:18.236 --> 53:19.937
That's perfect.

53:20.037 --> 53:22.073
So, he's looking at this man

53:22.173 --> 53:25.675
who has hair down
to his backside,
and he says,

53:25.775 --> 53:30.680
"Ma'am, I think you would
probably want to shave
before you go to court."

53:35.252 --> 53:39.156
- What? Did someone
cut the cheese?

53:45.529 --> 53:46.829
She'll be okay.

53:46.929 --> 53:49.332
Come on. Let's go.
No time to lose!

54:00.976 --> 54:03.878
Now, I want you
to turn right.

54:03.979 --> 54:05.713
Uh, my right,
or your right?

54:05.813 --> 54:07.815
Oh, just park somewhere!

54:10.553 --> 54:13.922
Yes! This will be
sufficient.

54:14.789 --> 54:17.859
Just pull up and park
by the, uh, refuse up ahead.

54:17.960 --> 54:21.096
- Where?
- The dumpster, Dobbins.

54:21.197 --> 54:23.898
Oh, yes. Right here.

54:27.336 --> 54:28.237
What do you see, Radar?

54:32.340 --> 54:33.807
- All clear. Okay.

54:33.907 --> 54:35.276
Let's go!

54:36.710 --> 54:39.013
Now, the mayor said
he disabled the cameras,

54:39.113 --> 54:40.747
so there should be no trail
leading to us.

54:40.847 --> 54:43.585
I can't believe we're gonna
split the money with him.

54:43.685 --> 54:45.819
Ha! That's what that fool
thinks.

54:45.919 --> 54:48.389
There's no honor
among thieves, Dobbins.

54:48.489 --> 54:51.792
No, no, no, no, no.
Once we have the sapphire
in our clutches,

54:51.892 --> 54:54.696
we will quickly abscond,
and we'll be on our way.

54:54.795 --> 54:57.030
But he could tell
everybody that it was us.

54:57.130 --> 54:59.899
- Ah, not without showing
his complicity.
- Oh...

55:00.000 --> 55:01.969
We just need him
to keep his mouth shut
long enough

55:02.069 --> 55:03.303
so that we can get
the sapphire,

55:03.403 --> 55:05.939
and we'll be on our way
and home free.

55:19.353 --> 55:23.457
Now the mayor told me
he would leave this door
unlocked.

55:26.825 --> 55:29.061
Plan B. My bag.

55:32.164 --> 55:33.599
If we had that turncoat
of a dog,

55:33.699 --> 55:36.402
we wouldn't need
these crude instruments.

55:36.502 --> 55:39.804
- The window? Smash it.
- Oh.

55:53.385 --> 55:54.918
Doc?

55:57.255 --> 55:58.789
You okay, doc?

56:01.760 --> 56:02.994
I don't know
what just happened,

56:03.094 --> 56:04.496
but I'm blaming you.

56:23.614 --> 56:24.648
Can you get us in?

56:29.086 --> 56:31.322
Ugh... "One second."

56:50.206 --> 56:54.477
- Whoa! You make keys?!
- Awesome!

56:56.145 --> 56:57.246
Come on!

57:00.650 --> 57:01.984
Help me up.

57:03.586 --> 57:06.589
Forget the window.
We'll find another way in.

57:48.095 --> 57:49.930
Don't tell me
we're too late.

57:57.037 --> 57:59.906
- Quick! Hide!
- Here. Put these on.

58:05.479 --> 58:07.114
You must be new.

58:10.317 --> 58:12.553
They make 'em better
every year.

58:16.389 --> 58:17.424
That was close.

58:17.524 --> 58:19.626
They must've stored
the sapphire somewhere else.

58:23.096 --> 58:25.098
She's got the scent.
Come on.

58:53.927 --> 58:55.461
Did you hear
something, Radar?

59:09.907 --> 59:11.342
That way.

59:15.146 --> 59:17.081
- It's them.
- The safe!

59:18.015 --> 59:18.983
We gotta hurry.

59:19.083 --> 59:20.685
Can you get
us in, Radar?

59:26.791 --> 59:28.693
Got it.

59:32.597 --> 59:33.698
Turn right.

59:38.936 --> 59:40.237
Stop.

59:45.475 --> 59:47.377
What happened?

59:47.477 --> 59:48.278
Batteries are out.

59:48.378 --> 59:50.146
You didn't put
new batteries in it?

59:50.247 --> 59:52.349
How was I supposed to know
the batteries were old?

59:52.449 --> 59:55.285
Forget it! We'll do it
in the dark. In and out.

59:58.455 --> 59:59.856
Hurry up, Radar!

59:59.957 --> 01:00:01.424
Turn left.

01:00:07.129 --> 01:00:09.265
What?!

01:00:09.365 --> 01:00:13.335
That dust-covered ingrate
must have locked it up
somewhere,

01:00:13.435 --> 01:00:16.639
and that inept mayor
failed to mention
where the safe was.

01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:18.707
Let's go check upstairs.

01:00:18.807 --> 01:00:20.376
Turn right.

01:00:20.476 --> 01:00:23.579
Stop. Open.

01:00:36.824 --> 01:00:38.293
This way!

01:00:39.494 --> 01:00:41.729
She says grab her.

01:00:51.472 --> 01:00:56.210
At last, Dobbins!
The prize is mine!

01:01:18.198 --> 01:01:20.434
- Don't you laugh at me!
- I-I wasn't laughing!

01:01:20.534 --> 01:01:22.102
- Don't you laugh at me!
- I-I wouldn't--

01:01:22.202 --> 01:01:23.203
Don't you laugh at me!!

01:01:23.303 --> 01:01:24.504
Ow! That hurt!

01:01:24.605 --> 01:01:25.872
Good!

01:01:36.215 --> 01:01:38.851
That. Was. Awesome!

01:01:38.952 --> 01:01:40.386
Totally!

01:01:43.255 --> 01:01:44.992
I'm telling you,
I didn't laugh, Doc.

01:01:45.092 --> 01:01:47.860
Oh, I deserve
to be laughed at!

01:01:47.961 --> 01:01:51.130
This has been
such a failure of epic,
monumental proportion,

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:55.201
I have half a mind to turn
myself in to the authorities
for incompetence.

01:01:55.301 --> 01:01:57.303
You peed yourself too?

01:01:57.403 --> 01:02:00.372
- Not incontinence!
- Okay.

01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:07.445
Dobbins, shut your trap
before I throttle you again.

01:02:07.545 --> 01:02:09.982
Just rotten luck
is all, Doc.

01:02:10.082 --> 01:02:11.516
No such thing.

01:02:11.616 --> 01:02:14.419
I was outfoxed
by that covetous mayor

01:02:14.519 --> 01:02:16.922
who took us
off the trail
just long enough

01:02:17.023 --> 01:02:18.991
so that he could
pilfer the sapphire

01:02:19.091 --> 01:02:21.493
and blame us for it. Ugh!

01:02:23.862 --> 01:02:25.664
You don't think that's
the kids, do you?

01:02:25.764 --> 01:02:28.632
Oh, yes. Some juveniles
from Podunk, Nowhere

01:02:28.732 --> 01:02:31.301
outsmarted me
and stole the sapphire?

01:02:31.402 --> 01:02:33.170
Not likely!
Use your head, Dobbins!

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:36.206
- I wonder what they're doing
over there, then.
- What?

01:02:42.746 --> 01:02:47.217
They're headed home,
where they think
they'll be safe and sound.

01:02:47.317 --> 01:02:49.553
This is going to be
like taking candy from a baby.

01:02:49.653 --> 01:02:52.256
Well, what about Dog?

01:02:52.356 --> 01:02:55.458
Oh, I'm more than prepared
for Dog this time.

01:02:55.558 --> 01:02:58.327
Once we're in range,
it's night-night, doggie.

01:02:58.428 --> 01:03:00.563
Hmm...

01:03:00.663 --> 01:03:03.266
We'll wait till light.
Mm-hmm.

01:03:03.366 --> 01:03:06.269
The mother will be at work,
and they'll be home alone.

01:03:06.369 --> 01:03:08.005
And that's when we strike!

01:03:08.105 --> 01:03:10.807
Let's call the mayor
and tell him
there's been a delay.

01:03:23.552 --> 01:03:26.055
So, the plan is,
Radar will make us
invisible again,

01:03:26.155 --> 01:03:28.623
then we can sneak
into the museum
and leave the sapphire.

01:03:28.724 --> 01:03:31.127
- Got it.
-  - Hold it right there!

01:03:31.226 --> 01:03:34.329
I want what is mine,
and I want it now!

01:03:38.767 --> 01:03:41.003
This is your last chance,
kiddies,

01:03:41.104 --> 01:03:44.173
or you can say
"goodbye, Lassie"!

01:03:45.741 --> 01:03:47.876
Fine. We'll give you
the sapphire.

01:03:47.977 --> 01:03:49.145
But you leave
Radar alone.

01:03:49.244 --> 01:03:51.612
Radar! Cool name.

01:03:51.712 --> 01:03:55.117
Be silent!
It's a terrible name.

01:03:55.217 --> 01:03:58.252
- So, it's a deal?
- Sure. Why not?

01:03:58.352 --> 01:04:00.922
Who needs
a disloyal dog anyway?

01:04:07.862 --> 01:04:09.663
Ha ha ha!

01:04:14.936 --> 01:04:17.438
- Oh...
- Oh!

01:04:19.305 --> 01:04:25.045
Oh, you poor, dimwitted,
trusting children.

01:04:25.146 --> 01:04:26.113
Bye, bye, doggie!

01:04:27.347 --> 01:04:28.782
No!

01:04:32.685 --> 01:04:34.788
You forgot to put batteries
in it, didn't you?

01:04:42.263 --> 01:04:44.165
Gabe! Grab the bag!

01:04:44.265 --> 01:04:45.498
Run!

01:04:48.234 --> 01:04:50.036
- Get after them!
- Okay!

01:04:51.837 --> 01:04:53.539
No! To the truck!

01:05:00.779 --> 01:05:02.148
Hey, I got your text
to come over.

01:05:02.248 --> 01:05:03.649
- What's going on?
- I'm so sorry, Debbie,

01:05:03.749 --> 01:05:05.151
someone has stolen
the sapphire.

01:05:05.251 --> 01:05:07.853
- What?
- Chief, this is a disaster.

01:05:07.954 --> 01:05:09.354
A disaster!

01:05:09.454 --> 01:05:12.158
We'll never see
that sapphire again,
or the people who took it!

01:05:12.258 --> 01:05:14.294
I'm not so sure about that.

01:05:14.393 --> 01:05:15.593
What do you mean?

01:05:15.693 --> 01:05:18.297
Well, the cameras
weren't rolling.

01:05:18.396 --> 01:05:19.730
I think it might've been
an inside job.

01:05:19.831 --> 01:05:22.067
And if it was an inside job,
then that means

01:05:22.167 --> 01:05:24.368
the criminal might be closer
than we'd like to think.

01:05:24.468 --> 01:05:26.437
Inside job?!
That's crazy talk!

01:05:26.537 --> 01:05:30.108
This is Dunedin.
We're- we're a quiet little town
full of law-abiding citizens.

01:05:30.209 --> 01:05:31.709
No. No.

01:05:31.809 --> 01:05:33.278
We have to accept
the facts, okay?

01:05:33.377 --> 01:05:35.379
It is lost.
The sapphire is lost,

01:05:35.479 --> 01:05:36.949
outsiders took it

01:05:37.049 --> 01:05:40.319
and we're never gonna see it
or hear from them ever again.

01:05:40.418 --> 01:05:42.054
Oh, my God! Gabe!

01:05:50.094 --> 01:05:51.428
Idiots!

01:06:01.571 --> 01:06:04.175
- Confound it, Dobbins!
- We lost them, Doc!

01:06:04.275 --> 01:06:06.978
If you weren't driving
like a geriatric going
to an early bird special,

01:06:07.078 --> 01:06:08.312
none of this
would've happened!

01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:10.981
I can't help it!
The speed limit is only 25!

01:06:11.081 --> 01:06:15.252
We don't observe speed limits.
We're villains, for God's sake!

01:06:15.352 --> 01:06:16.920
Now drive!

01:06:20.957 --> 01:06:23.026
Wait, wait! Chief,
Chief, Chief, hold on!

01:06:24.361 --> 01:06:26.062
Chief! Chief!

01:06:26.162 --> 01:06:27.630
Hold on. Listen.

01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:29.431
- Maybe you should wait
for backup.
- I'll be his backup.

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:31.034
- What?
- This could be dangerous.

01:06:31.134 --> 01:06:33.136
- Listen to him!
It could be dangerous!
- My son's out there!

01:06:33.236 --> 01:06:35.871
- Yeah, but backup's
important for--
- Drive!

01:06:35.972 --> 01:06:40.109
Wait, you guys-- I--
I'll follow you!

01:07:03.299 --> 01:07:06.467
Onward, Dobbins!
They couldn't have gone far.

01:07:06.567 --> 01:07:08.970
Thieving miscreants!

01:07:14.175 --> 01:07:16.044
Faster, Dobbins!

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:21.182
Puttering cyclists!
Out of the way!

01:07:41.667 --> 01:07:44.271
I think we lost them.

01:07:44.371 --> 01:07:47.407
Okay. Let's go.

01:07:49.209 --> 01:07:51.510
They found us!

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:53.246
Radar! Do Something!

01:08:02.956 --> 01:08:04.056
What happened?

01:08:18.237 --> 01:08:19.939
This is intolerable!

01:08:20.039 --> 01:08:22.640
Well, you were the one
who wanted to give her
all these gadgets!

01:08:22.741 --> 01:08:24.910
To evade the police,
not us!

01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:26.245
Let's go!

01:08:28.513 --> 01:08:31.483
Any State Troopers
in the Dunedin area,

01:08:31.582 --> 01:08:33.918
10-33. Over.

01:08:40.025 --> 01:08:41.592
<i>10-4.</i>

01:08:41.692 --> 01:08:44.295
<i>This is State Trooper Milligan.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

01:08:59.943 --> 01:09:03.546
10-31, two escaped convicts,
Phillipe Park. 10-24.

01:09:06.083 --> 01:09:08.085
Something's wrong
with Radar.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:09.286
What's up, girl?

01:09:14.124 --> 01:09:16.927
Oh, no. Her battery
is going dead.

01:09:17.027 --> 01:09:20.230
- You haven't been
charging her?
- I didn't know I had to.

01:09:24.001 --> 01:09:25.735
Radar, you've gotta get up!

01:09:28.304 --> 01:09:30.739
- Come on!
- No, Radar,
we won't leave you!

01:09:30.839 --> 01:09:31.840
She wants you to run!

01:09:31.941 --> 01:09:34.776
I can't! I can't leave her!

01:09:34.876 --> 01:09:36.979
You have to!
Do it for Radar!

01:09:45.388 --> 01:09:47.056
Oh.

01:09:47.156 --> 01:09:50.859
Need to recharge there,
you recreant perfidious
corruption of science?

01:09:53.296 --> 01:09:55.298
They've gotta be
somewhere!

01:09:55.398 --> 01:09:56.697
Joe!

01:10:00.368 --> 01:10:03.604
Please allow me to put you
out of your misery.

01:10:03.704 --> 01:10:05.941
Dobbins, batteries.

01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:16.017
You better come back, kiddies,
before your little friend here

01:10:16.118 --> 01:10:19.020
takes a walk
across the Rainbow Bridge.

01:10:19.121 --> 01:10:20.255
Nighty night!

01:10:21.223 --> 01:10:23.058
- No!
- Gabe!

01:10:29.096 --> 01:10:32.333
Come, Dobbins.
Let's go retrieve my sapphire.

01:10:43.477 --> 01:10:45.045
Oh! Radar!

01:10:45.812 --> 01:10:48.048
Oh, what did they
do to you?

01:10:50.683 --> 01:10:51.985
You're reading a text now?

01:10:52.085 --> 01:10:54.387
It's my emergency phone.
I should check this.

01:10:57.689 --> 01:11:01.294
"Battery low.
Please charge me."

01:11:02.896 --> 01:11:05.031
"This is Radar. Charge me!"

01:11:06.132 --> 01:11:08.867
Okay, so how do we
plug you in, Radar?

01:11:13.373 --> 01:11:15.074
Well, where's the plug?

01:11:18.378 --> 01:11:19.946
Oh. Ew.

01:11:26.751 --> 01:11:29.421
- What are you doing?
- Trust me!

01:11:41.266 --> 01:11:42.968
Oh, where did they go?

01:11:44.069 --> 01:11:45.637
I think
they went that way.

01:11:45.736 --> 01:11:47.973
Don't be a fool.
Let's go this way!

01:12:04.422 --> 01:12:06.390
Stop right there!

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:10.094
We can do this the easy way
and you can hand over
the sapphire,

01:12:10.194 --> 01:12:12.897
or we can do this the hard way.

01:12:12.997 --> 01:12:15.333
Whoa, Doc!
What is that?

01:12:15.433 --> 01:12:17.901
A freeze ray, Dobbins.

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:20.869
Stereotypical? Yes.
Trite? Perhaps.

01:12:20.971 --> 01:12:23.506
But I do love a classic.

01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:27.177
So, wait a second.
Why didn't you
use that earlier?

01:12:27.277 --> 01:12:29.778
Because I didn't want to,
that's why!

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:33.650
And now... now, I do.

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:57.006
All right, Radar.
Let's do this.

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:13.554
With each gravitational force
of the Moon upon the surface
of the Earth,

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:18.426
your fate becomes synonymous
with "sleeping with the fishes."

01:13:18.526 --> 01:13:20.595
- Huh?
- What?

01:13:20.695 --> 01:13:23.398
Why I'm even bothering

01:13:23.498 --> 01:13:26.367
with this kind of villainous
flair is beyond me.

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:30.238
The tide is coming in!

01:13:31.973 --> 01:13:34.808
Let's simplify this
for the juvenile brain,
shall we?

01:13:34.909 --> 01:13:37.545
You can drown in the ocean,

01:13:37.645 --> 01:13:40.415
or you can just give us
what we want, and we'll be
on our way.

01:13:42.316 --> 01:13:45.719
One, two...

01:13:45.818 --> 01:13:47.387
Just give it to him.

01:13:48.622 --> 01:13:50.023
Okay, fine!

01:13:50.123 --> 01:13:51.458
I'll give you
the sapphire.

01:13:52.626 --> 01:13:56.029
Well, well, well!

01:13:56.129 --> 01:13:59.232
Do you mind, Dobbins?
This is my moment in the sun!

01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:14.714
- Well, well, well!
- I just said that.

01:14:14.814 --> 01:14:17.049
Just shut up
and take it already!

01:14:18.951 --> 01:14:22.621
So much for my monologue.
Do you mind picking that up
for me, Dobbins?

01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:28.694
Now there's just one little
thing left to do.

01:14:28.794 --> 01:14:31.330
We gotta tie up
a few loose ends.

01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:41.306
- What are you doing?!
- We gave you the sapphire!

01:14:41.406 --> 01:14:43.708
Yes, and I thank you.

01:14:43.808 --> 01:14:46.144
But one cannot have
witnesses.

01:14:46.244 --> 01:14:49.880
W-whoa, wait,
wait, whoa, Doc.
They're just kids.

01:14:53.017 --> 01:14:55.720
I don't think
I can do this.

01:14:55.820 --> 01:15:00.291
Well, lucky for you,
I'm more than happy
to do the honors.

01:15:02.727 --> 01:15:04.329
Ow!

01:15:05.696 --> 01:15:07.197
Radar!

01:15:08.866 --> 01:15:11.168
I rue the day
I gave her a laser eye!

01:15:11.268 --> 01:15:12.569
I rue it!

01:15:18.876 --> 01:15:20.611
- Dobbins?
- Yeah?

01:15:20.711 --> 01:15:22.346
Those batteries
that you gave me.

01:15:22.446 --> 01:15:24.548
- Where did they come from?
- I got them
out of my flashlight.

01:15:24.648 --> 01:15:26.817
Hmm. The one
from the museum.

01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:29.920
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Lucky guess.

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.189
What happened?
Gabe!

01:15:32.289 --> 01:15:34.257
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:15:34.357 --> 01:15:36.859
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

01:15:36.959 --> 01:15:38.494
- in a court of law.
- Ow.

01:15:44.467 --> 01:15:47.737
- Good girl!
- Good girl!

01:15:47.837 --> 01:15:51.107
Good girl!
Good girl!

01:16:02.951 --> 01:16:05.922
Hey, kids. Would you put
the backpack and the gun
on the hood, please?

01:16:06.021 --> 01:16:07.122
- Sure.
- Absolutely.

01:16:07.222 --> 01:16:08.623
You're gonna stay
right here.

01:16:11.726 --> 01:16:15.430
Oh, ho, ho! I see you've
apprehended the thieves.

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:16.798
Good job, Chief.

01:16:16.899 --> 01:16:18.533
Where's
the, uh, sapphire?

01:16:18.633 --> 01:16:20.669
- It's--
- Backpack.

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:24.139
All right, everybody.
Stay back! Stay back!

01:16:24.239 --> 01:16:26.341
- Whoa.
- Well done, Mr. Mayor.

01:16:26.441 --> 01:16:30.946
Now, can you get
Barney Fife to uncuff us?

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:34.381
- Nah, nah, I'm good.
- We had a deal!

01:16:34.482 --> 01:16:35.649
Oh, please!

01:16:35.749 --> 01:16:39.086
You never intended
to play fair
and neither do I.

01:16:39.186 --> 01:16:40.754
I've played fair
my entire life,

01:16:40.855 --> 01:16:44.091
and where's that gotten me?
Mayor of some Podunk
little town.

01:16:44.191 --> 01:16:47.695
I should be governor by now,
or at least a Senator.

01:16:47.795 --> 01:16:49.864
No. No, no. I'm stuck here.

01:16:49.965 --> 01:16:52.733
I'm through
having noble dreams, okay?

01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:55.236
This is my dream now!

01:16:55.336 --> 01:16:58.371
This sapphire right here
will have me living
in the lap of luxury

01:16:58.471 --> 01:17:02.509
for the rest of my days,
far from here.

01:17:04.177 --> 01:17:06.914
Hey. You wanna help me
out here?

01:17:09.682 --> 01:17:10.850
Really?

01:17:10.951 --> 01:17:13.219
Welcome to my world.

01:17:15.722 --> 01:17:16.856
Sorry, kids.

01:17:16.957 --> 01:17:18.458
Maybe when you're
a little bit older,

01:17:18.558 --> 01:17:20.793
you'll understand
that when you play
by the rules,

01:17:20.895 --> 01:17:23.062
you come in last.

01:17:39.311 --> 01:17:41.413
- Hey, Milligan?
<i>- Yes, Chief.</i>

01:17:41.513 --> 01:17:43.615
Yeah. What's your location?

01:17:43.715 --> 01:17:45.317
<i>Northbound Phillipe Park.</i>

01:17:45.417 --> 01:17:46.920
Perfect.

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.655
So, in a minute or two,
you're gonna have the Mayor
headed your way,

01:17:49.755 --> 01:17:52.291
and I want you
to pull him over
and arrest him.

01:17:52.391 --> 01:17:54.058
<i>Wait? What?</i>

01:17:54.158 --> 01:17:57.261
<i>Arrest the Mayor?</i>

01:17:57.361 --> 01:18:00.264
<i>Like as mayor Fleming,</i>
<i>the Mayor?</i>

01:18:00.364 --> 01:18:04.635
<i>- All right,</i>
I see him up ahead.

01:18:04.735 --> 01:18:09.041
I'll explain later,
all right?
Thanks, Milligan.

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.010
Radar!
You let him get away
with the sapphire!

01:18:12.109 --> 01:18:15.948
No, she didn't.
Radar, go fetch
the sapphire.

01:18:28.124 --> 01:18:29.961
I hid it.

01:18:30.061 --> 01:18:32.862
I knew she'd be able
to sniff it out later.

01:18:32.964 --> 01:18:34.664
You little liar!

01:18:38.234 --> 01:18:40.136
- Good girl!
- Good girl!

01:18:42.739 --> 01:18:45.508
You're making a huge mistake,
officer. Huge mistake.

01:18:45.609 --> 01:18:48.378
I was not taking the sapphire,
I was holding it
for safekeeping.

01:18:48.478 --> 01:18:50.346
This could be your badge.
You know who I am, right?

01:18:50.446 --> 01:18:52.916
I'm the Mayor.
I'm the mayor of this town!

01:18:53.016 --> 01:18:55.417
I didn't do anything wrong!
Officer!

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.374
Hello, everyone.

01:19:19.474 --> 01:19:21.944
I want to thank you for coming
to our little town of Dunedin.

01:19:22.044 --> 01:19:23.778
It really means
the world to us.

01:19:23.879 --> 01:19:27.849
Now, I know we have
a lot of out of towners here,

01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:33.154
and it's people like you
that keep this town
and its citizens thriving,

01:19:33.254 --> 01:19:35.623
and I want you to know
that we appreciate you.

01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.133
But enough with all
the mushy stuff.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.868
Unless you've been
living under a rock,
I'm sure you've heard

01:19:47.969 --> 01:19:52.172
about all the craziness
that's happened
here recently,

01:19:52.272 --> 01:19:54.274
and among all that chaos,

01:19:54.374 --> 01:19:57.511
two kids and a dog

01:19:57.611 --> 01:20:00.180
embodied what Dunedin
stands for.

01:20:01.181 --> 01:20:02.582
Bravery...

01:20:02.683 --> 01:20:04.886
honesty...

01:20:04.986 --> 01:20:05.987
and kindness.

01:20:08.255 --> 01:20:09.957
Absolutely!

01:20:11.625 --> 01:20:15.227
Gabe, Kylie, and Radar,
please step forward.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.267
For saving the sapphire,

01:20:21.367 --> 01:20:25.237
and pretty much
this whole town,

01:20:25.337 --> 01:20:27.074
Dunedin would like
to honor you

01:20:27.174 --> 01:20:28.875
with the certificate
of bravery.

01:20:33.013 --> 01:20:34.580
Uh! Uh!

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:38.684
And the pirate's sword
of Dunedin.

01:20:43.354 --> 01:20:45.390
Yes! Yeah!

01:20:53.199 --> 01:20:56.068
Radar! Radar! Radar!

01:20:56.168 --> 01:20:59.404
Radar! Radar! Radar...

01:21:10.347 --> 01:21:13.650
<i>And that's how we became</i>
<i>the heroes of Dunedin,</i>

01:21:13.751 --> 01:21:17.956
<i>and Radar was honored</i>
<i>on the legendary wall</i>
<i>of Dogedin.</i>

01:21:18.056 --> 01:21:20.058
<i>And now,</i>
<i>wherever Radar goes,</i>

01:21:20.158 --> 01:21:22.227
<i>it's free spa treatments,</i>

01:21:22.326 --> 01:21:24.762
<i>tons of tasty treats,</i>
<i>ice cream.</i>

01:21:24.862 --> 01:21:28.465
<i>His favorite is still vanilla,</i>
<i>because it's the best flavor.</i>

01:21:28.565 --> 01:21:30.135
<i>But bionic or not,</i>

01:21:30.235 --> 01:21:34.139
<i>her favorite thing of all</i>
<i>is love.</i>
