WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:06.180
[knock at door]

00:06.354 --> 00:08.008
BRODY:
Hey.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.879
I, uh, let myself in
if that's okay?

00:10.053 --> 00:11.402
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:11.576 --> 00:12.969
Sure. Of course.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.144
Hey.Hey.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.406
How are you?

00:15.580 --> 00:17.060
[clears throat]

00:17.234 --> 00:18.583
So, uh, what's
going on here?

00:18.757 --> 00:19.758
Just scrambling.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.151
We've been, uh,

00:21.325 --> 00:22.935
on quite a roll,
knocking off the demons,

00:23.110 --> 00:24.111
thanks to the Avatars.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.938
Oh, the Avatars.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.592
Yeah, they have been great
helping us to find these demons.

00:27.766 --> 00:28.985
We can't pick 'em off
fast enough.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.552
Yeah, I guess that's why

00:30.726 --> 00:32.249
you haven't returned
any of my phone calls?

00:32.423 --> 00:34.947
I'm sorry. I just assumed
that you knew.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.079
Knew what?

00:36.253 --> 00:37.863
Well, that I was helping them.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.735
Creating Utopia, right.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.041
Is that a bad thing?

00:42.738 --> 00:44.261
Look, I thought
when we figured out

00:44.435 --> 00:46.089
that they didn't
kill your parents...

00:46.263 --> 00:47.656
Look, it doesn't mean that
they're still not a threat,

00:47.830 --> 00:48.787
Paige.
Come on...

00:48.961 --> 00:50.050
It doesn't change

00:50.224 --> 00:51.399
the ten years
I spent learning

00:51.573 --> 00:53.140
who they really
are, or why people

00:53.314 --> 00:54.532
fought them off for
thousands of years before us.

00:54.706 --> 00:55.794
Haven't we been over this?

00:55.968 --> 00:57.274
Obviously not enough.

00:57.448 --> 00:58.754
Actually, you know what, Kyle?

00:58.928 --> 01:00.799
I think we have.

01:00.973 --> 01:04.890
I'm sorry that you don't
or won'tunderstand,

01:05.065 --> 01:07.284
but my sisters and I--
we actually do.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.503
[sighs]

01:08.677 --> 01:10.287
Everything, everything

01:10.461 --> 01:14.552
the Avatars have said or done
has been totally legit.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.599
They didn't force
this on us.

01:17.773 --> 01:21.255
That's something
we really want for everybody.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.908
All right, all right.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.910
So, how's this
gonna happen?

01:25.085 --> 01:25.781
The change, I mean.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.218
Well, they, uh...

01:28.392 --> 01:30.438
They're gonna help us
write a spell.

01:30.612 --> 01:31.395
What kind of spell?

01:31.569 --> 01:33.397
I don't know yet.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.095
You don't know?

01:35.269 --> 01:36.531
They're getting you to
remake the freakin' world,

01:36.705 --> 01:37.619
and you don't know?

01:37.793 --> 01:39.142
I've been a little busy.

01:39.316 --> 01:41.101
Well, it's kind of a
fundamental question to ask,

01:41.275 --> 01:42.798
don't you think?

01:42.972 --> 01:45.061
I think it's more important
to get rid of as many demons

01:45.235 --> 01:46.671
as possible.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.108
Well, did you at least
check with the Elders?

01:48.282 --> 01:49.413
No.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.416
I don't think
they would understand.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.945
If you'll excuse me,

02:00.120 --> 02:03.253
I have one more demon
to go after, okay?

02:16.788 --> 02:18.703
Come on.

02:18.877 --> 02:22.403
Elders, Elders, Elders.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.361
[inhales and exhales deeply]

02:24.535 --> 02:26.494
I beg you, if you can hear me,

02:26.668 --> 02:28.539
I can help you stop the Avatars.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.889
I still have
a vanquishing potion.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.501
[inhales deeply]

02:33.675 --> 02:35.764
[wind howling, groans]

02:39.811 --> 02:41.639
Are you an Elder?

02:41.813 --> 02:43.598

04:32.315 --> 04:33.751
How'd you know
about that?

04:33.925 --> 04:36.145
That's why I knew to
bring you down here.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.582
We intercepted
your little cry for help.

04:40.236 --> 04:41.368
Sorry...

04:41.542 --> 04:42.543
[clears throat]:
Zankou.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.284
About the potion...

04:44.458 --> 04:47.112
Yeah, uh, look, it won't...
it won't kill you.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.114
Not unless you're an Avatar.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.421
Which is exactly why I want it.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.771
See, you and I have a lot
in common.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.947
We both wish to stop
what they're trying to do.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.472
We both desire
to keep things as they are, yes?

04:58.646 --> 04:59.951
In order to do that,

05:00.125 --> 05:01.649
we're going to have
to work together.

05:01.823 --> 05:04.478
With the Avatars' help,

05:04.652 --> 05:06.784
the Charmed Ones
are decimating our ranks.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.439
We must stop them
before they find us, too.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.136
I'm not helping you
hurt the sisters.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.921
I don't want to harm them.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.009
At least not yet.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.576
I mean,

05:15.750 --> 05:18.709
uh, we need them to help
stop the Avatars, right?

05:21.930 --> 05:24.149
Remind me why I
tolerate you again?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.326
Because you're running low
on demons?

05:26.500 --> 05:28.284
Look, I don't know
what you guys are getting at,

05:28.458 --> 05:29.981
but I think
you got the wrong idea here.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.592
I'm not gonna
help you.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.637
I can't. I won't.
I mean, you're demons.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.596
Yes.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.641
Yes, we are.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.948
Which makes us,
for better or worse,

05:40.122 --> 05:42.733
fundamental to the grand design.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.518
It keeps things in
balance, it gives

05:44.692 --> 05:47.521
the necessary contrast
to all that you covet,

05:47.695 --> 05:49.784
to all that is good.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.003
And therein lies
our mutual problem.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.223
You see, without

05:54.397 --> 05:56.443
the one...

05:56.617 --> 05:58.575
there can't be the other.

05:58.749 --> 06:01.317
Without evil...

06:01.491 --> 06:04.102
there can be no good.

06:04.276 --> 06:07.192
And that is why I think
you want to stop the Avatars

06:07.367 --> 06:09.281
just as much as I do.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.329
Okay.

06:13.503 --> 06:14.504
How?

06:14.678 --> 06:17.725
Your potion can kill one
of them,

06:17.899 --> 06:20.815
which might just weaken the rest
enough for us to kill them.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.730
Problem is,

06:22.904 --> 06:25.385
the Avatars have insulated
themselves now.

06:25.559 --> 06:28.257
Only the sisters
can get to them,

06:28.431 --> 06:32.217
and only you can reach
the sisters.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.219
I'm not going after Leo again.
Paige will kill me.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.438
He's not the only Avatar.

06:35.612 --> 06:36.526
Still, they're never gonna

06:36.700 --> 06:37.919
let me use the potion on anyone.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.181
Well, we can help that.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.706
If we work together.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.493
I can't.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.061
[laughs]

06:55.850 --> 06:57.504
You will.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.897
[gasps]

07:00.071 --> 07:02.291
[sighs]

07:02.465 --> 07:05.294
The problem is, his powers go
beyond the physical.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.340
Zankou has the gift
of prescience, as well.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.778
He anticipates where
we'll be looking for him next.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.562
Yeah, but on
the other hand,

07:12.736 --> 07:14.782
we've already gotten most
of the high-level demons.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.000
Isn't that enough?

07:16.174 --> 07:17.741
No.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.917
We shouldn't go through
with this until we can find him.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.223
GAMMA:
Although,
we might not have

07:21.397 --> 07:22.964
a choice.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.313
The planetary alignment
is correct for the change.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.575
The longer we wait...

07:25.749 --> 07:26.837
We still have time.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.622
We must keep
looking.
Why?

07:28.796 --> 07:29.666
You said yourself,

07:29.840 --> 07:31.233
we're not going to be able

07:31.407 --> 07:32.190
to knock off all
of the demons beforehand.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.365
There will be others.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.934
But Zankou poses
a unique threat.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.632
One that could
bring enough

07:38.806 --> 07:40.938
conflict into Utopia
to undermine it,

07:41.112 --> 07:42.592
and he's determined

07:42.766 --> 07:45.247
to do everything in
his power to stop us.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.206
He's not the only one.

07:49.294 --> 07:53.255
Um... just out of curiosity...

07:53.429 --> 07:54.865
the spell
that we're gonna cast--

07:55.039 --> 07:56.693
what exactly does it do?

07:56.867 --> 07:59.174
Unless you don't want us
to know.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.655
We have nothing
to hide, Paige.

08:01.829 --> 08:04.701
Then I'm all ears.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.398
The spell will...

08:06.573 --> 08:08.618
will put everyone to sleep,

08:08.792 --> 08:10.881
but only for a few hours.

08:11.055 --> 08:14.842
Just long enough
to erase the mindset of duality,

08:15.016 --> 08:16.496
of good
and evil.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.236
GAMMA:
To allow the
original design,

08:18.410 --> 08:21.109
that which every human being
has imprinted

08:21.283 --> 08:22.676
in their hearts, to take hold.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.591
Utopia.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.463
So, we go to sleep, too?

08:29.073 --> 08:30.553
PHOEBE:
Hello?

08:30.727 --> 08:31.815
Anybody home?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.515
[sighs]

08:35.689 --> 08:36.994
Yeah, it's about time.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.040
We weren't gone
that long.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.042
Besides, we must have
vanquished, what?

08:41.216 --> 08:42.957
Like, six or seven
upper-level demons.

08:43.131 --> 08:44.654
PIPER:
And a bunch of
other disgusting

08:44.828 --> 08:45.829
things.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.309
Grimlock eggs.Disgusting!

08:47.483 --> 08:48.484
Doesn't matter,
'cause after tomorrow,

08:48.658 --> 08:50.225
we won't have to
do this anymore.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.487
We're done.

08:51.661 --> 08:54.272
We still have to
find Zankou first.

08:54.446 --> 08:55.622
What if we can't?

08:55.796 --> 08:57.798
Then we, unlike
the rest of the world,

08:57.972 --> 08:59.843
will notbe taking
a catnap.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.671
Catnap?
What do you mean?

09:01.845 --> 09:04.108
A little something
they neglected to tell us.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.981
It's just the mechanics
of how the spell works.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.809
To put people to sleep

09:08.983 --> 09:10.811
so that the transformation
can occur.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.421
PAIGE:
Well, I for one,

09:12.595 --> 09:14.771
am damn well not going
to be taking a nap.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.120
PHOEBE:
Paige,

09:16.294 --> 09:17.469
what's going on?I just want to make sure

09:17.644 --> 09:19.123
we reallythought this out.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.560
Well, we've had
this conversation

09:20.734 --> 09:21.952
about a dozen times.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.475
You know, I mean,
there's only so much

09:23.650 --> 09:26.217
we can know,
and the rest is a leap of faith,

09:26.391 --> 09:28.263
one I thought
we were all ready for.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.308
ALPHA:
If it helps,
Paige,

09:30.482 --> 09:32.615
we never intended that
you or your sisters

09:32.789 --> 09:34.922
would join the others
until much later.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.358
Why?

09:36.532 --> 09:38.186
LEO:
Because there
will still be

09:38.360 --> 09:39.666
straggler demons, the ones
that live and walk among us.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.928
GAMMA:
Ones you'll nevertheless

09:41.102 --> 09:42.407
need to vanquish, though,

09:42.582 --> 09:44.409
so that conflict
doesn't seep back in.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.281
So, we still have
to fight demons?

09:46.455 --> 09:48.762
They'll be easy to spot
while the others are asleep,

09:48.936 --> 09:50.024
because they won't be.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.416
ALPHA:
But it shouldn't
take long.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.114
And then, it will be
up to you

09:53.288 --> 09:56.421
to decide when you're ready
to make the change.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.772
You okay with that?

10:01.601 --> 10:04.081
Yeah. Yeah.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.170
I guess so.

10:08.782 --> 10:09.957
What about Zankou?

10:10.131 --> 10:12.176
I think I know how to find him.

10:13.482 --> 10:14.831
PHOEBE:
Will you give me a lift?

10:15.005 --> 10:16.572
I want to make sure
I get my last column in.

10:16.746 --> 10:17.834
Last column?

10:18.008 --> 10:19.227
Well, yeah,
how much advice

10:19.401 --> 10:20.794
can a world without
conflict need?

10:20.968 --> 10:22.447
I may be out of a job.You okay with that?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.449
I've got better things
to look forward to.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.287
So what are we
doing here?

10:39.334 --> 10:41.336
Murderers!

10:41.510 --> 10:42.642
Let go of me!

10:42.816 --> 10:44.165
Let go!
What is this?

10:44.339 --> 10:47.124
This is his revenge.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.565
Zankou.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.394
[screams]

11:03.619 --> 11:06.013
They were the ones who killed
your parents, weren't they?

11:06.187 --> 11:07.405
The ones who really did it?

11:09.146 --> 11:10.408
You owe me for doing
something you could

11:10.582 --> 11:11.540
never have done without me.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.934
And you will repay me

11:14.108 --> 11:15.762
by doing something I
can't do without you.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.953
Are you leaving us?I'm sorry?

11:33.127 --> 11:35.564
"The Grass is Greener"?
Kind of a good-bye

11:35.738 --> 11:36.652
column, isn't it?

11:36.826 --> 11:38.654
No, not necessarily.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.264
Phoebe, I've been doing
this a long time.

11:40.438 --> 11:41.918
I know how to read
between the lines.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.660
Come on, talk to me.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.532
Okay, uh...

11:47.707 --> 11:49.839
It's just that... things change.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.493
You know what I mean?
Life changes.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.103
Don't you like
your job any more?

11:53.277 --> 11:55.149
Of course I do, Elise,
I love my job.

11:55.323 --> 11:57.020
You know that.
But?

11:57.194 --> 12:00.197
But like I said, things change.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.764
For the better though,
you'll see.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.200
No, I don't understand.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.376
Um, okay...

12:05.550 --> 12:08.205
Have you ever gone through
a period in your life

12:08.379 --> 12:10.164
where all you can think about,

12:10.338 --> 12:13.167
all you want to do
is just get away from it?

12:14.690 --> 12:16.257
When I was married to my ex.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.781
James L. Connors. What a shmuck.

12:18.955 --> 12:21.958
Okay, and you were able
to move on from him, right?

12:22.132 --> 12:24.004
Rebuild your life,
even though at the time

12:24.178 --> 12:25.483
you probably
thought you couldn't.

12:25.657 --> 12:27.921
Yeah.
Okay, well,
it's the same thing.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.313
That's what I'm talking about.

12:29.487 --> 12:31.228
One door closes
and another one opens.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.578
Sometimes you just have
to take that leap of faith.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.189
Phoebe, I don't...

12:35.363 --> 12:36.973
I promise you, Elise.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.715
This is gonna be great...
for everyone.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.238
Otherwise I wouldn't
be doing it.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.544
Do what?

12:42.718 --> 12:44.241
I gotta go.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.069
No. Wait.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.071
But you...Thank you, Elise.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.204
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.948
Good-bye, all of my dear,
beautiful friends.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.688
I will see you tomorrow
when a bright,

12:56.863 --> 12:58.516
new, sunshiny
day begins.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.345
Michelle,
you are the best.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.913
Donald... Donald,
I gotta tell you.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.960
You... you are the man.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.353
Gregg, I...

13:09.527 --> 13:11.181
Well, we never really
liked each other did we?

13:11.355 --> 13:12.400
Oh, well,

13:12.574 --> 13:14.358
that'll all change.

13:14.532 --> 13:15.925
Until tomorrow everyone.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.100
WOMAN:
What's going on?

13:17.274 --> 13:18.885
MAN:
Okay, bye.
Ta-ta!

13:19.929 --> 13:21.409
I was thinking, if we adjust

13:21.583 --> 13:23.454
the tracking spell we used
to find the Source,

13:23.628 --> 13:25.152
it might work on Zankou,
considering they were

13:25.326 --> 13:26.283
working so closely.

13:27.763 --> 13:28.895
Paige?

13:29.069 --> 13:30.679
Are you listening?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.115
Yeah, that sounds great.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.944
Well, it would if you
were listening to me.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.166
Sorry, it's just...
big change.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.558
I know, and you
know what?

13:40.732 --> 13:41.951
It's okay to be scared.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.431
I'm a little antsy,
Phoebe's nostalgic,

13:43.605 --> 13:45.346
and you're scared,
that's how we do things.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.914
No, I'm not scared.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.176
Fine, maybe a little.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.482
Okay, why?

13:51.656 --> 13:53.354
Well, because Kyle

13:53.528 --> 13:55.269
still thinks
the Avatars

13:55.443 --> 13:57.706
are a threat.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.926
And he's asking some pretty
damn good questions.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.278
And you trust him,
so you trust those questions.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.541
Exactly.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.848
Okay, I admit
I've asked myself

14:09.022 --> 14:10.762
those same questions
about a hundred times.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.026
But we have the answers now,

14:13.200 --> 14:14.984
we're not
going in blind.What are we going into?

14:15.158 --> 14:18.248
Apparently what we've always
wanted for the past seven years.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.076
We've been saving the world,

14:20.250 --> 14:21.730
being told
that it's our destiny.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.645
Maybe this is part
of our destiny.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.908
Bringing in Utopia?

14:26.082 --> 14:28.868
Putting an end to all this
good versus evil crap.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.522
I for one am tired of sleeping
with one eye open

14:31.696 --> 14:34.482
wondering which demon
is gonna finally get me.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.050
Or one of my sons.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.748
I've wondered the same thing.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.098
Well, you shouldn't have to.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.273
And neither should Phoebe.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.318
It's just Kyle.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.363
He has good evidence.

14:46.537 --> 14:49.497
And his hunches...
they've been right so far.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.194
Okay, but all of these hunches

14:51.368 --> 14:52.935
are based on a myopic
point of view.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.763
He's been trying to get
even with these people

14:54.937 --> 14:56.417
his entire life.

14:56.591 --> 14:59.115
The fact that they're
innocent is besides the point

14:59.289 --> 15:00.682
as far as he's concerned.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.379
I know.

15:03.859 --> 15:06.470
We deserve this opportunity,
Paige, we've earned it.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.996
Now let's go find Zankou.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.304
ZANKOU:
You must be very careful

15:14.478 --> 15:16.698
with this.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.874
Use it only exactly as I say.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.355
What is it?

15:21.529 --> 15:22.704
Put simply...

15:22.878 --> 15:24.271
Paranoia.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.926
A sorcerer once brought down

15:27.100 --> 15:28.449
an entire empire with this.

15:28.623 --> 15:31.452
Just by touching
a little witch.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.324
It spread, of course, as
paranoia is want to do.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.589
I'm betting it will do
the same to the sisters.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.069
No, I told you,
I won't harm them.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.419
I'm not asking you to.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.378
I just want you to
make them a little...

15:44.552 --> 15:46.293
scared, uncertain.

15:46.467 --> 15:47.947
Delusional.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.126
Only long enough
for the Avatars

15:53.300 --> 15:55.345
to be concerned that
something is not right.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.781
Draw them out
into the open.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.827
So I can use the potion.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.090
Precisely.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.268
Don't worry, you'll be
immune to its effects,

16:05.442 --> 16:06.443
since you're not a witch.

16:06.617 --> 16:07.836
How do I know that you're not

16:08.010 --> 16:09.055
gonna try and harm them anyway?

16:09.229 --> 16:11.492
[demons scream]

16:17.585 --> 16:18.586
Fireball!

16:23.286 --> 16:25.375
Go!

16:25.549 --> 16:27.508
Take it. It's
our last hope.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.205
[demons scream]Hurry!

16:29.379 --> 16:30.772
How do I reverse its effects?

16:30.946 --> 16:32.295
I'll be in touch.

16:41.174 --> 16:43.567
You're gonna need an alibi.

16:48.572 --> 16:49.486
Damn!

16:49.660 --> 16:51.445
[groans]

16:51.619 --> 16:53.534
Kyle?

16:58.800 --> 17:00.497
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.847
Great, then maybe you can start

17:03.022 --> 17:04.936
explaining what you're
doing down here.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.693
What's taking so long?

17:22.867 --> 17:24.347
He's resisting.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.740
Can you blame me?

17:26.958 --> 17:28.090
PIPER:
He's not the one we just found

17:28.264 --> 17:29.787
in the demon cave.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.398
You think I wanted
to be there?
I think you want

17:31.572 --> 17:33.748
to stop the Avatars,
and Zankou wants to stop

17:33.922 --> 17:35.228
the Avatars.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.577
So you see the connection there?

17:36.751 --> 17:39.058
Piper, you can't be serious.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.668
I'm just saying,
I'd like to know.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.934
He kidnapped me.Why?

17:46.108 --> 17:47.979
Because he thinks I can help
kill you, that's why.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.894
Don't you mean kill an Avatar?

17:50.069 --> 17:50.895
Same difference.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.072
Okay,

17:53.246 --> 17:55.596
what I don't
understand is why

17:55.770 --> 17:58.338
he would think that you
still had a potion?

17:58.512 --> 18:01.254
I don't know,
you should ask him.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.647
All right, I will.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.606
Well, Zankou's not gonna still
be there, he's on the run.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.869
So we got him once before,
I can do it again.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.218
I'm not just
gonna sit around

18:09.392 --> 18:10.785
and wait for him
to attack Kyle.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.308
You want to protect him?

18:12.482 --> 18:13.831
Help the Avatars
bring in Utopia,

18:14.005 --> 18:15.094
so Zankou can't stop it.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.617
He's right you know.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.576
You know, you don't
have to do that.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.448
Just use me as bait.
Wait till he attacks again.

18:21.622 --> 18:22.840
No, what if we're
too late next time?

18:23.014 --> 18:25.365
Well, so you are, I mean...

18:25.539 --> 18:28.585
You don't have to change
the whole world just to save me.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.761
Don't we?

18:30.935 --> 18:32.676
Look, every demon

18:32.850 --> 18:34.765
that tries to stop us
makes me just want

18:34.939 --> 18:36.332
to get through it faster.

18:36.506 --> 18:37.812
Let's just... do this.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.640
Paige, look, I don't...No.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.120
My mind is made up.

18:41.294 --> 18:42.773
Besides, I think
it's for the best.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.256
Tell them we're ready.

18:52.261 --> 18:55.960
Uh, I'll go see where Phoebe is.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.358
I can't let you do this.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.925
You don't have
a choice, honey.

19:05.448 --> 19:09.017
Besides, how bad can
a place called Utopia be?

19:09.191 --> 19:10.975
Wait.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.980
I'm sorry.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.247
What was that?What?

19:21.421 --> 19:23.031
You didn't feel that?

19:23.205 --> 19:25.512
No, it must have been
static electricity.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.166
Don't be so paranoid.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.953
Okay.

19:55.106 --> 19:55.933
Oh...

19:56.107 --> 19:58.806
So... how did it go?

20:00.677 --> 20:02.201
This better work.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.986
I agree.
For both our sakes.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.816
I see the Avatar's
healed your wound.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.776
Too bad you didn't
use the potion on him

20:12.950 --> 20:14.517
right there and then.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.084
None of this would
have been necessary.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.912
How do I reverse the paranoia?

20:18.086 --> 20:20.175
Patience.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.524
All in good time.

20:21.698 --> 20:22.612
Look, I held up
my end of the deal.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.179
As have I.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.616
You know, the problem
with you humans

20:26.790 --> 20:27.878
is your conscience.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.271
You are all always

20:29.445 --> 20:31.055
so conflicted.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.754
Demons on the other hand,
don't have such weakness.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.886
It's not weakness.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.671
It's how we stay honest.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.934
It's what helps us
choose between good and you.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.632
It also messes with your head.

20:42.806 --> 20:45.200
As it is clearly
doing right now.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.985
Working with evil...

20:48.159 --> 20:50.161
to preserve good.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.294
It would give me a headache.

20:52.468 --> 20:53.861
What do you want?

20:54.035 --> 20:55.297
Huh? What are you doing here?

20:55.471 --> 20:56.646
I want the potion.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.953
Well, I'm not giving it to you.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.433
I'm not gonna use, either.

21:00.607 --> 21:01.825
Not until I know
the sisters are safe.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.046
Which won't be
for a while, I'm afraid.

21:06.482 --> 21:09.050
Not until the full effects
of the paranoia take hold.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.226
To that end I suggest
you come with me.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.967
Why?

21:13.141 --> 21:15.099
Well, we wouldn't want
you falling asleep

21:15.274 --> 21:17.841
with everyone else,
now would we?

21:18.015 --> 21:20.061
Nah, you are going

21:20.235 --> 21:21.628
to be the proverbial

21:21.802 --> 21:24.152
straw that breaks
the camel's back.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.378
Uh... hello?

21:32.552 --> 21:34.205
What are you doing?

21:34.380 --> 21:35.903
Well, you know... just trying
to organize some books.

21:36.077 --> 21:37.121
Just in case.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.602
Now? Everybody's
waiting for you.

21:39.776 --> 21:40.951
Well, yeah,
but I might not

21:41.125 --> 21:42.301
have a chance to do
this afterwards.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.259
Uh... to do what?

21:44.433 --> 21:46.043
Well, these are books on demons.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.785
We might not need them
if there are no demons.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.049
Oh, what if they come back?

21:52.223 --> 21:53.703
Then we'll have
to have them again.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.576
I better put them all back.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.447
Uh... sweetie,
you don't really

21:58.621 --> 21:59.709
seem like yourself.

21:59.883 --> 22:01.929
I don't?

22:02.103 --> 22:04.453
Who am I?
No,

22:04.627 --> 22:06.586
I mean... you're stalling.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.762
And you know what,
it's okay. We know what

22:08.936 --> 22:10.241
we're doing,
we're ready for this.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.982
You sure?

22:12.156 --> 22:13.375
What if something
goes wrong?

22:13.549 --> 22:16.073
Well, then we'll fix it
like we always do.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.858
Come on... ahh!

22:18.032 --> 22:19.381
What was that?What was what?

22:19.555 --> 22:20.339
That!

22:20.513 --> 22:21.427
Well, I don't know,

22:21.601 --> 22:22.645
why don't you tell me?

22:23.733 --> 22:26.083
Come on, everybody's waiting.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.955
Everybody.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.305
Hey.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.002
I was just looking
for you guys.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.177
Why, what's wrong?

22:33.352 --> 22:34.614
Nothing's wrong,

22:34.788 --> 22:35.919
I just wanted
to know what happened.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.399
Well, nothing happened,

22:37.573 --> 22:38.792
if you think that's
a problem though.

22:38.966 --> 22:40.359
What?

22:40.533 --> 22:41.925
Are you feeling okay? Oh.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.754
What was that?

22:44.928 --> 22:46.582
See?
See what?

22:46.756 --> 22:48.062
Uh,

22:48.236 --> 22:49.629
guys... you mind?

22:49.803 --> 22:51.282
Are you ready?

22:51.457 --> 22:53.154
Yeah, I think so.

22:53.328 --> 22:54.895
Is there something
that we should know...

22:55.069 --> 22:56.287
that we
don't know?

22:56.462 --> 22:59.160
You know?

23:00.422 --> 23:01.467
Uh...

23:01.641 --> 23:03.599
no, Paige.

23:03.773 --> 23:04.948
Wait, wait,
we forgot

23:05.122 --> 23:06.559
about Zankou,
what if he attacks?

23:06.733 --> 23:07.995
That's true,
what if he does attack?

23:08.169 --> 23:09.692
Oh, maybe we
shouldn't do this.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.694
Okay, what is wrong with you
guys? We discussed this.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.043
You'll still have
your powers

23:13.217 --> 23:14.567
afterwards.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.133
If Zankou attacks,
you'll be prepared.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.266
In fact he'll be more
exposed than ever.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.746
Especially
as you

23:19.920 --> 23:22.096
continue to thin out
the demonic ranks.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.141
How do we know
you're not lying to us?

23:24.315 --> 23:25.316
Okay,

23:25.491 --> 23:27.231
let's... let's do this.

23:28.015 --> 23:29.103
Very well.

23:31.061 --> 23:32.062
Whoa.

23:32.236 --> 23:33.237
Where'd you come from?

23:33.412 --> 23:34.413
They're a little nervous.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.240
I understand.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.591
Place your hands
on the cartouche.

23:40.593 --> 23:41.550
It's okay.

24:11.406 --> 24:14.453
♪ ♪

24:43.133 --> 24:47.094
♪ ♪

25:02.936 --> 25:04.546

PHOEBE:
I mean, is
everyone okay?

25:12.336 --> 25:13.642
Are you sure
nobody's hurt?

25:13.816 --> 25:14.991
BETA:
The effect
was gradual.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.777
They all fell asleep
gently and safely.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.648
PIPER:
How do you know that for sure?

25:19.822 --> 25:22.259
Do you see anybody who's
been harmed in any way?

25:22.433 --> 25:24.914
Well, that doesn't rule out
internal injuries.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.263
LEO:
Piper.
What?

25:26.437 --> 25:28.222
So everybody's like
this everywhere,

25:28.396 --> 25:29.353
all around
the world?

25:29.528 --> 25:30.964
All around the world.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.443
What about the airplanes
and the helicopters?

25:32.618 --> 25:34.097
How do we know
they landed safely?

25:34.271 --> 25:36.752
Look, I'm sure the Avatars
took care of all that.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.449
Relax, what's gotten
into you guys?

25:38.624 --> 25:40.756
Well, I think we have
a little right to be jumpy

25:40.930 --> 25:42.497
with everything that's going on,
don't you think?

25:42.671 --> 25:43.803
Perhaps it would help

25:43.977 --> 25:45.239
to focus on the
straggler demons.

25:45.413 --> 25:47.154
They hide amongst
your kind,

25:47.328 --> 25:48.721
which means if there
are any nearby

25:48.895 --> 25:50.853
they're only pretending
to be asleep.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.376
I should have known.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.030
Why don't they just leave?

25:54.204 --> 25:56.119
Because they've got
no place else left to go.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.252
Uh... over there.

25:58.426 --> 25:59.601
He moved.
What?

25:59.775 --> 26:01.298
Where? Which one?

26:01.472 --> 26:02.691
That one in
the bad suit.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.999
Oh.
You must be certain.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.217
Okay.

26:07.391 --> 26:08.436
Go be certain.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.805
[sighs]

26:29.979 --> 26:32.112
Well, at least
I know I'm not paranoid.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.766
LEO:
All right, so

26:33.940 --> 26:35.115
how long until the
transformation is complete?

26:35.289 --> 26:36.856
Two hours.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.509
which means we should
get back until it's safe.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.033
Well, I'm not leaving
them here alone.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.296
Don't worry Beta,
I'll be fine.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.256
All right, let's split up,

26:46.430 --> 26:47.475
we'll find more
demons that way.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.998
Piper, Paige,
Phoebe and me.

26:49.172 --> 26:50.913
Any sign of trouble, orb
back to the manor, got it?

26:51.087 --> 26:52.088
Got it.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.442
Why do you think he didn't
want to go with me?

26:58.617 --> 26:59.879
Do you think he's
seeing someone else?

27:00.053 --> 27:01.054
Come on.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.316
What?

27:05.580 --> 27:06.407
I don't understand.

27:06.581 --> 27:07.582
What are we waiting for?

27:07.756 --> 27:09.279
Arhh!

27:11.934 --> 27:12.892
That

27:13.066 --> 27:14.807
is what we're
waiting for.

27:15.851 --> 27:18.724
Death will not have been
in vain my friend.

27:19.855 --> 27:22.205
I promise you.

27:25.295 --> 27:26.470
[screams]

27:28.995 --> 27:30.736
What the hell was
that all about?He saw

27:30.910 --> 27:32.346
what I needed to see.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.827
And now I know which Avatar
we'll be flushing out...

27:35.001 --> 27:36.306
and you'll be killing.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.613
What... how?
I'm going to
need a volunteer.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.833
Wh... does it
have to be me?

27:42.269 --> 27:43.749
No.

27:43.923 --> 27:46.099
Oh good, I'll get
right on it.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.491
Look, I don't
like this.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.058
I don't like being
kept in the dark

27:49.232 --> 27:50.103
about what's going on.

27:50.277 --> 27:51.365
What are you going to do?

27:51.539 --> 27:53.236
Not kill an
Avatar for one.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.021
Then you'll die.
Yeah, well,

27:55.195 --> 27:56.718
better me than
the sisters, right?

27:56.892 --> 27:58.589
How many times do I have
to tell you, I'm not after them.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.417
Then why won't you tell me what
the hell I'm doing down here?

28:00.591 --> 28:02.550
Well, that's what you get
when you make a deal

28:02.724 --> 28:04.117
with the devil...
so to speak.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.554
Well, I'm not
doing anything

28:06.728 --> 28:09.383
until I know the
sisters are all right.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.602
They're still alive,
if that's what you mean.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.518
Their paranoia growing.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.607
What are we waiting for?

28:16.782 --> 28:19.959
The opportune time
to show yourself.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.223
Which nears.

28:23.397 --> 28:25.399
When?

28:25.573 --> 28:26.617
When I send one of

28:26.792 --> 28:28.010
the sisters
to you, here.

28:28.184 --> 28:30.360
The one you care
so much about.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.014
How does that flush
out the Avatars?

28:32.188 --> 28:34.451
Oh, just say they
wanted you to stay awake,

28:34.625 --> 28:36.802
tell her it was the
female Avatar, Beta.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.891
Your girlfriend will
get so paranoid,

28:39.065 --> 28:40.893
she'll demand
an explanation.

28:41.067 --> 28:43.286
When the Avatar shows up
to give her one,

28:43.460 --> 28:45.332
that's when you strike
with the potion.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.247
Don't miss...

28:47.421 --> 28:49.118
you won't get a second chance.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.903
First,

28:51.077 --> 28:52.731
how do I reverse the paranoia?

28:55.255 --> 28:57.387
You are persistent,
aren't you?

28:59.389 --> 29:02.436
Very well.

29:02.610 --> 29:05.091
You break the crystal.

29:05.265 --> 29:07.180
The sisters will revert
immediately.

29:07.354 --> 29:09.965
That's it?That's it.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.576
So why didn't you
tell me this before?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.013
The same reason
you didn't tell me

29:14.187 --> 29:15.405
where the potion was.

29:15.579 --> 29:16.929
Leverage.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.411
Remember...

29:21.585 --> 29:23.631
don't miss.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.656
Phoebe, are you sure
you're all right?

29:48.830 --> 29:49.875
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...

29:50.049 --> 29:51.920
I have a bad feeling
about this.

29:52.094 --> 29:53.792
Well, you've had a bad feeling
about everything lately.

29:53.966 --> 29:56.272
Yeah, but I have a really
bad feeling about this.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.100
Are you sure
we're not being set up?

29:58.274 --> 29:59.928
Phoebe, not this again.No.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.887
I'm serious. What if the Avatars
are like the Trojan Horse?

30:02.061 --> 30:03.410
Remember the Trojan Horse?

30:03.584 --> 30:04.803
Phoebe.
They come into
your life,

30:04.977 --> 30:06.805
pretending to be the gift,

30:06.979 --> 30:08.937
but what they really
want to do is kill you.

30:09.111 --> 30:10.852
Phoebe, this really
isn't like you.

30:11.026 --> 30:14.682
Leo, listen to me okay.
It's the ultimate conspiracy.

30:14.856 --> 30:15.726
Think about it for...

30:15.901 --> 30:17.511
What was that?

30:18.991 --> 30:21.428
It was nothing.
Look, you need to calm down.

30:21.602 --> 30:22.951
I am very calm, okay.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.474
I just can't help
what I'm feeling

30:24.648 --> 30:26.607
and what I'm feeling
right now is... demons!

30:34.136 --> 30:36.399
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry again.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.010
Why did you run?
I don't know.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.925
Something's wrong, I'm
getting you out of here.

30:46.975 --> 30:49.499
I haven't seen any
demons for a while.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.850
Don't you think
that means something?

30:52.024 --> 30:53.939
I don't know, you?I don't know.

30:54.983 --> 30:57.029
Why are you stopping,
what do you see?

30:57.203 --> 30:59.031
Nothing. Shh, relax.

30:59.205 --> 31:01.207
What if they get us?

31:01.381 --> 31:03.122
Who is "they"?
They.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.428
They as in them, the
ones who are always
trying to get us.

31:05.602 --> 31:06.516
Shh, you're
making me crazy.

31:06.690 --> 31:07.778
You're making me crazy.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.476
What is wrong with us?

31:14.829 --> 31:17.527
Oh, sorry.

31:17.701 --> 31:20.182
You okay?
Yes.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.576
But I'm afraid
that your friend may not be.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.709
Kyle?
What's wrong
with him?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.189
We don't know.

31:27.363 --> 31:29.104
All we know is that
he didn't fall asleep

31:29.278 --> 31:30.540
like everyone else did.

31:30.714 --> 31:31.541
What does that mean?

31:31.715 --> 31:33.761
That means that Zankou

31:33.935 --> 31:35.719
must have gotten to him again...

31:35.894 --> 31:37.417
shielded him from us.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.593
But why?

31:39.767 --> 31:41.421
Because he thinks he
still has the potion.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.205
Damn it, I should never
have left him alone.

31:45.338 --> 31:46.469
Hey.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.689
You can't leave
me here alone.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.386
Demon.Wha...

31:50.560 --> 31:51.605
What... where?

31:51.779 --> 31:53.128
Go, get him.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.052
Kyle? You here?

32:04.226 --> 32:05.401
Yeah.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.490
I'm right here.Oh.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.364
You okay?

32:11.538 --> 32:12.582
Did he hurt you?

32:12.756 --> 32:13.801
Did who hurt me?

32:13.975 --> 32:15.324
Zankou.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.326
Come on, we have to
get you out of here.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.111
Wait, wait... why?Because he thinks you
still have the potion.

32:19.285 --> 32:20.112
He'll kill you.

32:20.286 --> 32:21.722
Yeah.

32:21.896 --> 32:24.290
Don't you think he would
have killed me by now?

32:24.464 --> 32:28.033
Well, that's why he's
keeping you awake,

32:28.207 --> 32:29.773
because he thinks
you still have it.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.211
He's not the one keeping
me awake, Paige.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.864
It's the Avatars.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.650
It's Beta.

32:36.824 --> 32:40.610
Okay, but she said
Zankou did it.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.525
Maybe you ought
to call her here.

32:45.441 --> 32:46.529
Beta.

32:49.097 --> 32:51.578
What's the matter?

32:51.752 --> 32:52.927
Why isn't he asleep?

32:53.101 --> 32:53.972
You told me Zankou did it.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.191
I did not.Yes you did.

32:57.453 --> 32:58.672
What the hell is going on?

33:03.807 --> 33:05.331
What was that?

33:05.505 --> 33:07.246
I wanted to make sure
that you were

33:07.420 --> 33:08.464
back to normal... before I...

33:08.638 --> 33:10.466
Before what?

33:22.478 --> 33:24.437
[grunts]

33:33.228 --> 33:35.665
[coughs]

33:39.974 --> 33:41.976
[sniffling]

33:42.150 --> 33:44.065
Please don't hate me.

33:46.154 --> 33:47.416
I don't hate you.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.983
[sobbing]:
Of course I don't hate you.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.593
I didn't want it
to end like this.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.421
It's not gonna end
this way, I promise.

33:52.595 --> 33:53.466
I'm gonna call for help...

33:53.640 --> 33:54.684
No.

33:54.858 --> 33:56.469
You can't
call for Leo.

33:56.643 --> 33:57.731
Why?

33:57.905 --> 33:58.732
Because he's
vulnerable.

33:58.906 --> 34:01.082
They all are.

34:01.256 --> 34:02.605
Zankou will kill them.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.783
Why did you do this?

34:08.829 --> 34:10.396
To stop them.

34:14.574 --> 34:16.315
Leo!

34:16.489 --> 34:17.707
ALPHA:
He can't hear you, Paige.

34:19.231 --> 34:23.365
He's been affected
by what's happened.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.889
We all have.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.850
PAIGE:
Can't you just
rewind time?

34:30.024 --> 34:31.721
Just go back and just fix it?

34:31.895 --> 34:34.333
I'm sorry, Paige.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.770
But we've come too far
to go back now.

34:38.032 --> 34:39.555
But he's dying.

34:40.861 --> 34:42.384
Yes.

34:42.558 --> 34:45.431
And he's weakened
the collective,

34:45.605 --> 34:47.737
risked losing all
we've worked to create.

34:47.911 --> 34:50.088
The demon will try to take
advantage of this to stop us.

34:50.262 --> 34:51.785
But he won't be able to

34:51.959 --> 34:54.744
if we consolidate power,
complete the transformation.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.050
[coughs]

34:56.224 --> 34:58.444
What the hell
are you talking about?

34:58.618 --> 34:59.532
What about him?

34:59.706 --> 35:03.405
The needs of the one...

35:03.579 --> 35:05.842
must be sacrificed
for the good of the many.

35:06.016 --> 35:08.018
You'll
understand soon.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.760
PAIGE:
I did not sign up

35:10.934 --> 35:13.415
for this experiment
so you could play God!

35:13.589 --> 35:15.809
So you fix this right now!

35:15.983 --> 35:17.419
He's dead.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.169
Please don't go.

35:28.343 --> 35:31.477
We must move quickly.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.087
We can't fight both
them and the demon.

35:33.261 --> 35:34.088
What about Leo?

35:34.262 --> 35:36.786
He's one of us now.

35:36.960 --> 35:37.961
He'll understand.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.970
[sobbing]:
Please.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.022
I don't get it.
I don't know what happened.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.242
I mean, one minute I feel
like everyone's after me,

35:57.416 --> 35:59.418
and then the next minute,
I feel perfectly fine.

35:59.592 --> 36:00.941
Yeah. I don't.

36:01.115 --> 36:02.072
What's the matter?
What are you feeling?

36:02.247 --> 36:03.552
I don't know, all of a sudden

36:03.726 --> 36:04.901
I just feel weaker.

36:05.075 --> 36:07.730
Well, maybe you
should sit... down.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.781
Phoebe?

36:14.955 --> 36:16.086
Phoebe.

36:16.261 --> 36:18.306
Phoebe, can
you hear me?

36:18.480 --> 36:19.481
Wake up.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.485
Piper.

36:24.573 --> 36:27.402
Piper.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.883
Piper!

36:30.057 --> 36:31.101
Piper.

36:33.974 --> 36:36.368
She's just sleeping, Leo.

36:36.542 --> 36:39.153
She'll be fine,
they'll all be fine.

36:39.327 --> 36:40.372
What have you done to her?

36:40.546 --> 36:41.895
The same thing
that's been done

36:42.069 --> 36:43.418
to everyone else.

36:43.592 --> 36:44.637
But they weren't
supposed to turn yet,

36:44.811 --> 36:45.768
not until they were ready.

36:45.942 --> 36:47.335
We had no choice.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.598
What do you mean
you didn't have a choice?

36:51.034 --> 36:51.905
You can't do this.

36:52.079 --> 36:53.559
Beta's dead, Leo.

36:53.733 --> 36:55.387
What?

36:55.561 --> 36:57.911
That's why you feel
less powerful.

36:58.085 --> 36:58.955
Why we all do.

36:59.129 --> 37:00.870
But how...

37:01.044 --> 37:03.830
It seems that Agent Brody
had another potion after all.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.225
One that both
he and Zankou hoped

37:07.399 --> 37:11.141
to bring down Utopia with,
before it even began.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.056
GAMMA:
But we can't
let that happen.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.581
The sooner we complete
the transformation,

37:15.755 --> 37:17.496
the less chance
he has of succeeding.

37:17.670 --> 37:20.194
Which is why we need the power
of the Charmed Ones with us,

37:20.368 --> 37:23.241
now more than ever.

37:23.415 --> 37:24.938
I'm sure you understand.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.245
But we were supposed
to talk to them first.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.508
Ideally, yes.

37:29.682 --> 37:33.338
But Paige... was inconsolable.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.257
Agent Brody is dead as well.

37:40.910 --> 37:44.174
We must press on, Leo, now,

37:44.349 --> 37:46.002
or Zankou will win.

37:46.176 --> 37:49.354
All that we've done
will have been for naught.

37:50.616 --> 37:51.921
We can still give them

37:52.095 --> 37:53.532
the world they've
always wanted, Leo,

37:53.706 --> 37:55.229
the happiness
they've never known,

37:55.403 --> 37:57.666
the happiness
you've never known.

37:59.799 --> 38:03.368
But we must move quickly...
and as one.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.761
LEO:
I just, I don't see

38:05.935 --> 38:07.372
how Paige is gonna be happy
after what happened.

38:07.546 --> 38:08.851
She'll understand.

38:09.025 --> 38:11.550
ALPHA:
Everyone will understand

38:11.724 --> 38:14.466
that those who bring conflict
into the world...

38:16.511 --> 38:19.427
cannot be tolerated.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.049
[car engines starting]

38:33.223 --> 38:35.138
[people chattering]

38:41.754 --> 38:43.408
Hey, I'm sorry.

38:43.582 --> 38:45.018
This is my fault.

38:45.192 --> 38:46.498
Forget it.

38:46.672 --> 38:47.542
It's no big deal.

38:47.716 --> 38:48.413
You sure?

38:48.587 --> 38:50.153
Absolutely.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.590
[chuckles]:
I'm so embarrassed.

39:02.557 --> 39:05.386
I'm so sorry.

39:05.560 --> 39:06.822
I don't know
what happened.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.781
You got insurance?
Yeah.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.609
Then don't worry about it.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.611
Thanks.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.409
Well?

39:28.583 --> 39:30.759
Utopia has begun.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.239
What's that mean?

39:32.413 --> 39:33.545
We're screwed?

39:33.719 --> 39:36.417
The Avatars have
turned the witches

39:36.591 --> 39:38.550
sooner than I anticipated.

39:38.724 --> 39:40.943
We can't change things back
without their help.

39:41.117 --> 39:43.119
Well, then we've got
to get out of here.

39:43.293 --> 39:44.425
They'll be coming for us, too.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.298
No, we have time.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.344
How do you figure?

39:50.518 --> 39:52.477
It's over, Zankou.

39:52.651 --> 39:54.566
We don't stand a chance
in this new world.

39:54.740 --> 39:57.177
Still, we planted a seed.

39:57.351 --> 39:58.613
Let's see if it sprouts.

40:06.447 --> 40:08.275
I don't know what
you're so worried about.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.625
It's all good, as far
as I'm concerned.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.975
Yeah, but they were supposed
to wait until you were ready.

40:13.149 --> 40:14.760
Well, as you know,

40:14.934 --> 40:17.110
I've been more than ready
for this for a long time.

40:17.284 --> 40:18.677
PHOEBE:
Hey!

40:18.851 --> 40:20.156
I feel great.

40:20.330 --> 40:21.767
Don't you guys
feel great?

40:21.941 --> 40:22.985
Yeah, pretty amazing.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.334
I mean, it's
so weird.

40:24.509 --> 40:25.771
I remember the old
way, you know,

40:25.945 --> 40:27.381
the demon battling
and everything,

40:27.555 --> 40:29.122
but I'm just not stressed
about it anymore.

40:29.296 --> 40:31.037
Yeah, well that's because
we don't have to worry

40:31.211 --> 40:33.256
about demons anymore,
which leaves us

40:33.431 --> 40:36.477
a little time to
live a little.

40:36.651 --> 40:38.000
Where are the boys?

40:38.174 --> 40:39.872
Magic School.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.874
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

40:42.048 --> 40:43.353
PHOEBE:
Leo, of course,
are you kidding?

40:43.528 --> 40:46.095
How can we not be?

40:47.314 --> 40:49.272
Hi.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.360
Oh, sweetie,

40:50.535 --> 40:51.623
I'm so sorry.

40:51.797 --> 40:52.928
Me, too.

40:54.930 --> 40:57.542
How you doing?
Are you hanging in there?

40:57.716 --> 40:59.108
Yeah.

40:59.282 --> 41:01.023
Yeah, I'm holding up.

41:01.197 --> 41:03.199
It's, um...

41:03.373 --> 41:04.853
pretty damn sad.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.420
But...

41:06.594 --> 41:08.727
he's going on
to a better place, right?

41:10.555 --> 41:12.470
I'm gonna go upstairs
and rest.
