WEBVTT

00:00.144 --> 00:01.948
JACK ASKED ME
NOT TO SHOW YOU.

00:01.948 --> 00:04.378
I WAS TRYING
TO BE A TEAM PLAYER.

00:05.812 --> 00:07.648
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:07.648 --> 00:09.950
YOU'RE NOT JACK.
AND YOU NEVER WILL BE.

00:11.618 --> 00:14.454
YOU SAID YOU HAD
A BIG STORY FOR ME.

00:14.454 --> 00:17.624
THIS ONE
GETS US THE PULITZER.

00:17.624 --> 00:20.794
FRAUD, THREATS,
CHICAGO REAL ESTATE.

00:20.794 --> 00:22.362
I KILLED LOU MROZEK.

00:22.362 --> 00:24.031
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE CARRIED A GUN.

00:24.031 --> 00:25.832
I LUNGED, WRESTLED IT
FROM HIS HANDS,

00:25.832 --> 00:27.301
AND IT WAS
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

00:27.301 --> 00:29.336
WHY WOULD HE LIE?!
BECAUSE IT WAS HIS SON.

00:30.637 --> 00:32.339
VIC!

00:32.339 --> 00:35.342
EVEN IF JACK DIDN'T DO IT,
HE IS A BAD GUY.

00:35.342 --> 00:36.977
I DON'T WANT
HIM AROUND YOU.

00:36.977 --> 00:40.013
I DON'T WANT HIM AROUND OLIVER.
IT IS NOT SAFE.

00:40.013 --> 00:43.283
I LOVE YOU,
BUT I JUST CAN'T BE WITH YOU.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.721
YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE UP KARSTEN.

00:47.721 --> 00:49.423
IF YOU LEAVE OUT
ONE THING,

00:49.423 --> 00:51.692
IF KARSTEN FORGOT TO CHANGE
A BLOWN BULB ON A SCAFFOLDING

00:51.692 --> 00:53.360
AND YOU DON'T
TELL ME ABOUT IT --

00:53.360 --> 00:55.195
THEN YOU'RE COMING
AFTER ME.

00:55.195 --> 00:56.697
NO.

00:56.697 --> 01:00.100
I'LL GO AFTER YOUR SON.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.602
YOU WERE EMPLOYED

01:01.602 --> 01:03.437
BY THATCHER KARSTEN
FOR THE PAST 18 YEARS.

01:03.437 --> 01:05.772
IS THAT CORRECT, MR. McALLISTER?
YES, IT IS.

01:05.772 --> 01:08.375
ARE YOU PREPARED TO GIVE
THOROUGH AND TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY

01:08.375 --> 01:10.877
TO THIS GRAND JURY,
AS PER YOUR OBLIGATION UNDER LAW

01:10.877 --> 01:12.946
AND THE IMMUNITY
PROVIDED TO YOU?

01:12.946 --> 01:15.115
I AM.

01:15.115 --> 01:20.053
I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT
YOUR ATTENTION TO MARCH 2011

01:20.053 --> 01:25.058
TO A KARSTEN ALLIED DEVELOPMENT
SITE ON THE NEAR NORTH SIDE.

01:25.058 --> 01:27.728
WAS THIS BUILDING
EVER INSPECTED?

01:27.728 --> 01:29.062
NO, IT WAS NOT.

01:29.062 --> 01:30.631
WHY NOT?

01:30.631 --> 01:32.366
BECAUSE THE INSPECTOR
WAS PAID OFF.

01:32.366 --> 01:34.301
$347,000.

01:34.301 --> 01:36.103
$1.7 MILLION.

01:36.103 --> 01:37.304
IT WAS $4 MILLION.

01:37.304 --> 01:39.973
ALL OF WHICH IS DOCUMENTED
ON A COMPANY FLASH DRIVE

01:39.973 --> 01:41.642
PROVIDED TO THIS JURY

01:41.642 --> 01:43.944
BY KARSTEN ALLIED I.T. WORKER
JULIET WHITMAN?

01:43.944 --> 01:45.412
CORRECT.
AND IF BRIBERY DIDN'T WORK,

01:45.412 --> 01:49.916
OTHER...METHODS OF PERSUASION
WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED?

01:49.916 --> 01:51.752
HE WAS ROUGHED UP.

01:51.752 --> 01:53.120
HER FAMILY WAS THREATENED.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.655
HIS KNEES
WERE SHATTERED.

01:54.655 --> 01:56.690
WHO ORDERED THAT?
IT WAS THATCHER KARSTEN.

01:56.690 --> 01:58.959
I SAW -- YES,
IT WAS THATCHER KARSTEN.

01:58.959 --> 02:00.627
CORRECT.
THATCHER KARSTEN.

02:00.627 --> 02:03.630
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
ALDERMAN BERNARD ARKOVICH?

02:03.630 --> 02:04.898
I AM.

02:04.898 --> 02:07.134
COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN
TO THE JURY WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

02:07.134 --> 02:09.136
THATCHER
PICKED UP A NAIL GUN

02:09.136 --> 02:10.971
AND NAILED MR. ARKOVICH'S
HANDS TO THE SLAB.

02:10.971 --> 02:12.439
ALL BECAUSE
THE GOOD ALDERMAN

02:12.439 --> 02:14.775
WOULDN'T VOTE
TO REZONE HIS PROPERTY?

02:14.775 --> 02:17.477
CORRECT.
DID MR. KARSTEN
EXPLAIN HIS ACTIONS?

02:17.477 --> 02:20.914
NO. ALL HE SAID WAS,
"CHICAGO NEVER CHANGES."

02:20.914 --> 02:24.318
WELL, APPARENTLY,
IT DOES.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.320
HOW LONG BEFORE THEY HAND DOWN
AN INDICTMENT?

02:26.320 --> 02:29.156
COULD BE A FEW WEEKS.
GRAND JURIES GO SLOW.

02:29.156 --> 02:31.491
AND THEN WHAT KIND OF PRISON
TIME WILL HE BE LOOKING AT?

02:31.491 --> 02:33.994
OPTIMISTICALLY,
5 TO 10, I'M GUESSING.

02:33.994 --> 02:37.831
SERIOUSLY? I GAVE YOU
ASSAULT, TAX FRAUD, BRIBERY --

02:37.831 --> 02:39.933
HEY, KARSTEN'S CONNECTIONS
RUN DEEP,

02:39.933 --> 02:41.935
AND NONE OF THE INDIVIDUAL
CHARGES IS A HOME RUN.

02:41.935 --> 02:43.603
5 TO 10 WILL BE A<i> WIN.</i>

02:43.603 --> 02:45.272
18 YEARS'
WORTH OF TESTIMONY,

02:45.272 --> 02:47.107
AND ALL YOU CAN PIN
HIM ON IS 5 TO 10?

02:47.107 --> 02:48.942
WITH GOOD BEHAVIOR,
HE'LL BE OUT IN THREE.

02:48.942 --> 02:50.610
HE'S A 70-YEAR-OLD MAN.

02:50.610 --> 02:52.112
HIS COMPANY'S
CIRCLING THE DRAIN.

02:52.112 --> 02:54.881
ANY CLOUT HE HAD IN THIS TOWN --
IT'S DONE. STICK A FORK IN HIM.

02:54.881 --> 02:57.718
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?
STAFFORD.

02:57.718 --> 02:59.886
GEORGIE-P! THOUGHT
WE LOST YOU DOWNSTATE.

02:59.886 --> 03:01.788
SPRINGFIELD'S
A BUNCH OF ANIMALS.

03:01.788 --> 03:04.157
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR --
STAY OUT OF POLITICS.

03:04.157 --> 03:05.826
HOW THE HELL ARE YOU?
GOOD.

03:05.826 --> 03:08.328
FAMILY?
OLLIE'S 7.
HE'S IN FIRST GRADE.

03:08.328 --> 03:11.498
WOW. SARA?
UH, SHE JUST WON
A BIG PHOTOJOURNALISM AWARD.

03:11.498 --> 03:14.167
GOOD TO HEAR. LET'S GET
THE KIDS TOGETHER SOMETIME.
WE'D LOVE IT.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.836
ALL RIGHT.

03:53.507 --> 03:55.175
COMING.

03:58.979 --> 04:00.814
HEY.
HEY.

04:03.116 --> 04:06.787
SORRY IT'S SUCH A MESS.
MOVERS COME THURSDAY.

04:06.787 --> 04:08.121
SO, YOU FOUND
A NEW PLACE?

04:08.121 --> 04:11.291
YEAH, A, UH,
ONE-BED IN ROSCOE VILLAGE.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.460
THAT'S CLOSE.

04:13.460 --> 04:17.297
YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE
PICKUPS AND DROP-OFFS EASIER.

04:17.297 --> 04:20.600
MODERN LIT.
MY SENIOR YEAR.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.870
YOU ALWAYS
SAT IN THE BACK.

04:23.870 --> 04:25.572
YOU, IN THE FRONT.

04:25.572 --> 04:28.575
UNTIL I MET YOU.

04:31.244 --> 04:34.915
SO, UH, YOUR ATTORNEY
LOOKED THESE OVER.

04:34.915 --> 04:37.083
YOU JUST SIGN THE TABS.
IT'S FOUR PLACES, I THINK.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.419
THE LAST ONE'S
THE CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENT,

04:39.419 --> 04:41.087
AND I'M A LITTLE
EMBARRASSED BY IT

04:41.087 --> 04:43.757
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS SO MUCH
HARSHER ON PAPER.

04:43.757 --> 04:47.861
IT JUST STIPULATES THAT --
THAT I NOT SEE JACK.
NO, I KNOW.

04:48.995 --> 04:51.498
WELL, UH...

04:51.498 --> 04:55.001
I GUESS -- WHAT? -- I'LL SEE YOU
AT OLLIE'S NEXT SOCCER GAME.

04:55.001 --> 04:58.071
YEAH. YEAH.

05:00.140 --> 05:02.476
WELL, TAKE CARE, THEN.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.312
YOU, TOO, DREW.

05:32.439 --> 05:35.442
-- Captions by VITAC --

05:45.218 --> 05:46.753
GREAT.

05:55.829 --> 05:57.831
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, HANLEY?

05:57.831 --> 06:00.400
I THOUGHT
WE WORKED THROUGH THIS.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.735
"TRIPLE-A TRAVEL GUIDE" --

06:01.735 --> 06:04.204
SELLING AMERICA'S
FAMILY-FRIENDLY CITY.

06:04.204 --> 06:06.039
YOU ARE A PHOTOJOURNALIST.
SAY IT WITH ME.

06:06.039 --> 06:07.641
"I AM A..."

06:07.641 --> 06:10.043
SINGLE MOM WHO NEEDS
A SALARY WITH BENEFITS.

06:10.043 --> 06:11.978
AND AN AWARD-WINNING
PHOTOJOURNALIST.

06:11.978 --> 06:13.813
<i>ONE</i> AWARD.

06:13.813 --> 06:15.982
THE CHICAGO PRESS AWARD
IS NO JOKE.

06:15.982 --> 06:18.318
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN THINK
A PHOTOGRAPHER HAS EVEN WON IT

06:18.318 --> 06:21.888
IN LIKE 10 YEARS,
SO YOU CAN'T BAIL ON THE EVENT.

06:21.888 --> 06:24.357
<i>PLUS,</i> THERE'S THIS CUTE INTERN
WHO WORKS THE METRO DESK --

06:24.357 --> 06:25.692
SAID SHE'D BE THERE.

06:25.692 --> 06:28.194
TOTAL GEEK-GIRL VIBE GOING --
STRAIGHT UP MY ALLEY.
HMM.

06:28.194 --> 06:29.829
SHE'S HELPING ME
WITH THIS THING.

06:29.829 --> 06:31.264
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?

06:31.264 --> 06:34.100
FREELANCE PIECE -- A SERIES
OF CONSTRUCTION VIOLATIONS

06:34.100 --> 06:36.236
SPANNING
THE PAST FEW DECADES.

06:36.236 --> 06:37.270
REALLY?
WHAT GOT YOU INTO THAT?

06:37.270 --> 06:39.472
UH, SOMETHING
JACK HAD ME LOOK INTO --

06:39.472 --> 06:40.941
SOMETHING WITH HIS FAMILY.

06:40.941 --> 06:45.111
BUT, UH, WILL YOU SHOOT
THESE PROPERTIES FOR ME?

06:45.111 --> 06:47.280
YEAH. SURE.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.949
THANK YOU.

06:48.949 --> 06:50.884
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
7:00.

07:06.132 --> 07:08.134
IT'S NOT GOOD.

07:08.134 --> 07:11.304
GRAND JURY -- THEY'RE
SNIFFING THROUGH EVERYTHING,

07:11.304 --> 07:13.640
GOING WAY BACK.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.276
I'VE SURVIVED
GRAND JURIES BEFORE.

07:16.276 --> 07:17.811
McALLISTER'S TALKING.

07:17.811 --> 07:19.813
WHAT ABOUT?

07:19.813 --> 07:22.816
BRIBERIES, PAYOUTS,
TAX EVASION...

07:22.816 --> 07:24.884
EVEN ASSAULT AND BATTERY.

07:24.884 --> 07:28.221
IF THAT GRAND JURY
BUYS WHAT HE'S SELLING,

07:28.221 --> 07:30.690
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE YOU'RE IN CUFFS.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.197
LOOK, I'VE ALWAYS LIKED JACK,
BUT HE'S A PROBLEM FOR YOU NOW.

07:37.197 --> 07:38.932
FOR ME?

07:38.932 --> 07:41.935
YOU THINK THOSE BASTARDS
ARE GONNA SPARE SOME DIRTY COP

07:41.935 --> 07:44.270
WHO'S BEEN ON THE TAKE
FOR 10 YEARS?

07:44.270 --> 07:47.273
THAT THEY'RE NOT THINKING
HOW GOOD YOUR FACE IS GONNA LOOK

07:47.273 --> 07:50.944
ON THE FRONT PAGE
NEXT TO MINE?

07:50.944 --> 07:53.179
JUST DO
WHAT I PAY YOU FOR.

07:53.179 --> 07:54.814
I WANT THOSE DOCUMENTS.

07:54.814 --> 07:58.485
JUROR NAMES, PHONE NUMBERS --
THE GRAND JURIES
ARE SEALED, SECRET.

07:58.485 --> 08:01.488
YOU -- YOU THINK I CAN JUST
WALTZ INTO THE JUDGE'S CHAMBER

08:01.488 --> 08:03.156
AND ASK FOR THE CASE FILES?

08:03.156 --> 08:07.494
WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU CAN WALTZ
YOURSELF RIGHT INTO STATEVILLE.

08:07.494 --> 08:10.163
I HEAR IT'S LIKE
MOST OTHER PRISONS.

08:10.163 --> 08:12.632
THEY DON'T LIKE COPS.

08:12.632 --> 08:16.636
SHUT HIM UP, OR I WILL.

09:16.674 --> 09:18.176
IT WAS KARSTEN --
IT HAD TO BE --

09:18.176 --> 09:21.279
OR SOMEONE WORKING FOR HIM.
AND YOU SAY THIS
BECAUSE WHY?

09:21.279 --> 09:23.748
THE GUY IN THE PHOTO --
IT'S KARSTEN'S SON-IN-LAW.

09:25.884 --> 09:27.585
WELL, DO WE NEED TO
CHECK IN ON HIM,

09:27.585 --> 09:29.153
MAKE SURE HE'S NOT
IN ANY DANGER?

09:29.153 --> 09:30.722
HE'S FINE.
I WAS WITH HIM ALL MORNING.

09:30.722 --> 09:32.390
HE'S A KEY WITNESS

09:32.390 --> 09:34.626
IN THE SEALED GRAND JURY CASE
AGAINST THATCHER KARSTEN,

09:34.626 --> 09:36.628
AND THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

09:36.628 --> 09:41.199
"SHUT HIM UP" --
SHUT UP MY WITNESS, McALLISTER.

09:41.199 --> 09:43.968
AND THE TWO OF YOU ARE...
IN A RELATIONSHIP?

09:43.968 --> 09:46.671
WE WERE. IT'S OVER.
IT HAS BEEN FOR WEEKS NOW.

09:49.007 --> 09:51.042
I NEED YOU TO KEEP
AN EYE ON THIS PLACE,

09:51.042 --> 09:53.578
PUT A SURVEILLANCE DETAIL
ON IT -- AS A FAVOR TO ME?

09:53.578 --> 09:55.246
SURE THING.

09:55.246 --> 09:59.183
UH, DO YOU HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO
STAY FOR THE TIME BEING, MA'AM?

09:59.183 --> 10:01.586
YES. SHE DOES.

10:05.690 --> 10:08.092
I'M FINE. I AM.

10:08.092 --> 10:10.495
I'M FOCUSING ON SCHOOL,
AND THINGS ARE GOOD.

10:10.495 --> 10:12.497
ACTUALLY, I HAVE A HISTORY PAPER
I'M BEHIND ON, SO...

10:12.497 --> 10:15.333
VIC, SCHOOLWORK'S
NOT WHAT WE'RE ASKING ABOUT.

10:16.768 --> 10:20.772
HONEY, SIT DOWN.

10:24.642 --> 10:26.311
WE...

10:26.311 --> 10:29.314
WE JUST...

10:29.314 --> 10:32.183
WE DON'T EVER WANT YOU TO FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE BY YOURSELF IN THIS.

10:32.183 --> 10:35.186
YEAH, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
WHAT HAPPENED WITH LOU --

10:35.186 --> 10:38.690
I KNOW. I GET IT.
IT NEEDS TO STAY BETWEEN US.

10:38.690 --> 10:39.857
RIGHT, BUT WE WANT YOU
TO KNOW

10:39.857 --> 10:41.225
THAT YOU CAN
TALK TO US ABOUT IT.

10:41.225 --> 10:43.394
YEAH, WE'VE HAD
THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE,

10:43.394 --> 10:45.530
BUT I DON'T
NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

10:45.530 --> 10:47.799
I'M GOOD. REALLY.

10:47.799 --> 10:50.268
LOOK.
WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENED.

10:50.268 --> 10:53.605
I'M SORRY FOR IT --
I AM --

10:53.605 --> 10:55.740
BUT THERE'S NO GOOD
LOOKING BACK.

10:55.740 --> 10:57.875
LOOKING BACK ON WHAT?

10:57.875 --> 11:00.578
UH, WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT VIC'S SCHOOLWORK.

11:00.578 --> 11:01.646
WHY?
DID YOU FLUNK OUT?

11:01.646 --> 11:02.947
NO, SHUT UP.

11:02.947 --> 11:05.416
VAL, SIT DOWN.

11:05.416 --> 11:06.918
WHAT DID I DO?
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

11:06.918 --> 11:11.356
THERE'S SOMETHING WE NEED
TO TELL YOU -- BOTH OF YOU.

11:14.425 --> 11:17.261
YOUR GRANDFATHER IS PROBABLY
ABOUT TO BE INDICTED

11:17.261 --> 11:20.431
BY A GRAND JURY
FOR SOME SERIOUS CRIMES.

11:20.431 --> 11:22.333
HE MAY BE ARRESTED SOON.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.135
WHAT? WHY?

11:24.135 --> 11:25.970
THERE'S A BUNCH OF THINGS
THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON

11:25.970 --> 11:27.972
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:27.972 --> 11:30.408
LOOK,
YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED.

11:30.408 --> 11:33.177
THERE MAY BE
SOME MEDIA ATTENTION BECAUSE...

11:33.177 --> 11:37.915
WELL, THE FACT IS,
I'M TESTIFYING AGAINST HIM.

11:37.915 --> 11:40.585
WAIT, HOLD ON. YOU'RE --
AND A LOT OF THINGS
ARE GONNA COME OUT --

11:40.585 --> 11:42.954
YOU KNOW, UGLY THINGS.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

11:42.954 --> 11:45.423
BECAUSE IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

11:45.423 --> 11:47.425
LOOK, HE'S STILL
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

11:47.425 --> 11:48.426
YOU KNOW,
HE STILL LOVES YOU.

11:48.426 --> 11:51.429
BUT YOU'RE
TURNING ON HIM. WHY?

11:51.429 --> 11:53.097
I MEAN -- A-AND AFTER ALL
THE THINGS YOU DID FOR ME,

11:53.097 --> 11:54.465
WHY WOULD YOU BE
SUCH A HYPOCRITE?!

11:54.465 --> 11:56.467
VIC, DON'T.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:56.467 --> 11:57.969
NOTHING.

11:57.969 --> 12:00.705
WHAT DOES THAT --
A HYPOCRITE FOR WHAT?

12:07.011 --> 12:08.980
TELL ME!

12:11.616 --> 12:13.951
FINE.

12:13.951 --> 12:16.621
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

12:16.621 --> 12:20.291
YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN TOTALLY
VAGUE AND COMPLETELY DISTURBING.

12:23.161 --> 12:25.163
I LIKE IT'S ALL OF US
FOR DINNER.

12:25.163 --> 12:26.864
IS IT GONNA BE
EVERY NIGHT?

12:26.864 --> 12:29.867
UM, NO, SWEETIE.
JUST FOR A WHILE.

12:29.867 --> 12:31.202
AW, HOW LONG?

12:31.202 --> 12:32.670
I DON'T KNOW.

12:32.670 --> 12:35.073
AS LONG AS YOUR MOM
NEEDS TO STAY HERE.

12:35.073 --> 12:38.409
YES! AND CAN WE ALSO WATCH
A MOVIE TOGETHER AFTER DINNER?

12:38.409 --> 12:40.411
ALL THREE OF US?

12:42.847 --> 12:45.850
WHY NOT?
WE CAN MAKE
ICE-CREAM SUNDAES!

12:45.850 --> 12:47.351
AND AT BEDTIME, WILL YOU BOTH
READ ME A STORY --

12:47.351 --> 12:50.088
FIRST DADDY, THEN MOMMY --
LIKE WE USED TO?

12:50.088 --> 12:51.989
ABSOLUTELY.

12:51.989 --> 12:54.625
THIS IS GONNA BE
AMAZING!

12:59.831 --> 13:03.334
OKAY.

13:03.334 --> 13:05.336
SO, VAL KNOWS
SOMETHING'S UP.

13:05.336 --> 13:07.338
YOU HEARD HER EARLIER.
YEAH.

13:07.338 --> 13:09.207
WELL,
WHAT ARE WE DOING, JACK?

13:10.508 --> 13:13.344
THESE LAST FEW MONTHS,
IT'S ALL BEEN TOO MUCH FOR THEM,

13:13.344 --> 13:15.346
AND NOW THEIR GRANDFATHER --
I JUST...

13:15.346 --> 13:17.014
I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE CAN EXPECT

13:17.014 --> 13:19.684
TWO TEENAGERS
TO MANAGE ALL OF THIS.

13:19.684 --> 13:23.054
DO YOU WANT ME
TO NOT TESTIFY?

13:23.054 --> 13:26.390
NO, BUT I DO THINK
YOU NEED TO BE

13:26.390 --> 13:27.892
MORE INVOLVED
IN THEIR LIVES.

13:27.892 --> 13:30.561
WELL, I AM INVOLVED.
YOU ARE NOT HERE,

13:30.561 --> 13:33.297
AND THEY'RE AT AN AGE WHERE
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SEEK YOU OUT.

13:33.297 --> 13:35.700
YOU WANT ME
TO MOVE BACK IN?

13:35.700 --> 13:37.869
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA,

13:37.869 --> 13:41.639
BUT I-I DO THINK
YOU NEED TO BE HERE MORE.

13:41.639 --> 13:44.642
OKAY.

13:44.642 --> 13:48.479
WELL, I'LL -- I'LL COME BY
AFTER SCHOOL DURING THE WEEK.

13:48.479 --> 13:52.150
OKAY, YEAH, YOU CAN HELP THEM
WITH THEIR HOMEWORK,

13:52.150 --> 13:54.619
WATCH A MOVIE, WHATEVER.
I JUST --

13:54.619 --> 13:56.287
I WANT THEM TO KNOW
THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON US,

13:56.287 --> 13:57.822
THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE.

13:57.822 --> 14:00.491
WE OWE THEM THAT.

14:10.735 --> 14:13.404
THANKS FOR
LETTING ME STAY, DREW.

14:13.404 --> 14:15.139
WELL,
I'M HEADING TO BED.

14:15.139 --> 14:16.440
YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED?

14:16.440 --> 14:18.409
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:18.409 --> 14:20.111
WHY DON'T I STAY ON THE COUCH?
YOU GO SLEEP IN THE BED.

14:20.111 --> 14:21.512
NO.
IT'S FINE, SARA.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.348
ANYTHING LESS
WOULD BE UNCHIVALROUS.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

14:24.348 --> 14:26.450
IT'S YOUR WEEK WITH OLIVER.
YOU GET THE BED.

14:26.450 --> 14:29.287
YOU -- YOU BETTER MOVE BECAUSE
I AM SLEEPING ON THIS COUCH,

14:29.287 --> 14:31.956
AND YOU KNOW I KICK
WHEN I SLEEP.

14:33.291 --> 14:36.460
TONIGHT WAS NICE.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.063
IT WAS.

14:40.965 --> 14:43.901
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

14:49.607 --> 14:53.277
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.
NIGHT.

15:00.785 --> 15:02.787
WE SH-- WE SHOULDN'T.

15:02.787 --> 15:05.790
MM.
WE'RE HERE...NOW.

15:05.790 --> 15:08.125
LET'S NOT WORRY
ABOUT LATER.

15:17.881 --> 15:18.515
■

16:02.559 --> 16:04.061
MOM, GET UP.

16:04.061 --> 16:07.064
OHH. OOH.

16:08.398 --> 16:10.759
MM. WHERE'S
MY MORNING HUG?

16:12.261 --> 16:13.929
COME ON, MOM.
IT'S TIME FOR PANCAKES!

16:13.929 --> 16:17.433
PANCAKES!
PANCAKES! PANCAKES! PANCAKES!

16:17.433 --> 16:19.268
I THINK MAYBE
YOUR SON WANTS SOME PANCAKES.

16:19.268 --> 16:21.770
YEAH.

16:21.770 --> 16:25.274
SLEEP ALL RIGHT?
UH, YEAH.

16:25.274 --> 16:27.743
ARE WE OKAY?
YEAH, OF COURSE.

16:27.743 --> 16:31.247
I JUST -- I DON'T WANT IT
TO BE CONFUSING.

16:31.247 --> 16:33.582
NO, I MEAN, WE JUST --
WE GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

16:33.582 --> 16:35.784
THAT'S ALL --
A LITTLE NOSTALGIC.

16:35.784 --> 16:37.319
RIGHT.
THAT'S ALL.

16:37.319 --> 16:38.587
WE'RE GOOD.

16:38.587 --> 16:39.989
MOM, DAD,
WHERE'S THE MAPLE SYRUP?

16:39.989 --> 16:42.658
COMING!

17:02.378 --> 17:05.381
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE
ABOUT THE BREAK-IN.

17:05.381 --> 17:08.384
I'M FINE. REALLY.

17:08.384 --> 17:10.619
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO
COME OVER.

17:10.619 --> 17:13.322
WELL, I WANTED TO.

17:13.322 --> 17:15.324
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

17:17.826 --> 17:20.296
YOU KNOW, YOU --
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

17:20.296 --> 17:22.464
I'M NOT.

17:22.464 --> 17:24.934
I'M BACK HOME.

17:27.503 --> 17:30.172
UH, AT LEAST
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

17:32.942 --> 17:35.945
I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR AWARD.

17:35.945 --> 17:38.914
IT'S GREAT.

17:38.914 --> 17:41.483
I'M GLAD THINGS
ARE GOING WELL FOR YOU.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.502
I HAVE TO GO.

19:12.474 --> 19:15.978
HEY. NO WORK?

19:15.978 --> 19:18.981
OH,
I-I TOOK THE DAY OFF.

19:18.981 --> 19:21.116
WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?

19:22.418 --> 19:27.656
SUDDENLY, HE'S IN MODEL U.N.
HE'S MR. EXTRACURRICULAR.

19:27.656 --> 19:30.125
HE'S DEVELOPING INTERESTS.
I-I THINK THAT'S GOOD.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.627
DO YOU?

19:31.627 --> 19:33.962
BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S PRETTY WEIRD.

19:37.566 --> 19:39.735
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

19:42.037 --> 19:44.039
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
PLEASE DON'T.

19:44.039 --> 19:45.841
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

19:45.841 --> 19:48.444
I WALK INTO THE ROOM,
AND EVERYONE STOPS TALKING.

19:48.444 --> 19:49.778
YOU BARELY
LEAVE THE HOUSE,

19:49.778 --> 19:53.282
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO VIC IS ANYMORE.

19:53.282 --> 19:55.451
HE'S GOING
THROUGH A ROUGH TIME.

19:55.451 --> 19:58.620
OBVIOUSLY, BUT WHY?

19:58.620 --> 20:01.290
Y-YOUR FATHER
AND THE INVESTIGATION.

20:01.290 --> 20:04.360
NO, VIC HAS BEEN
ACTING CRAZY FOR MONTHS,

20:04.360 --> 20:08.530
WAY BEFORE
ANY OF THIS STUFF HAPPENED.

20:08.530 --> 20:11.533
WHAT IS IT?

20:11.533 --> 20:13.402
YOU CAN'T KEEP IT
FROM ME FOREVER.

20:18.474 --> 20:22.144
YOU DON'T SAY A WORD
ABOUT THIS TO ANYONE --

20:22.144 --> 20:26.648
NOT JULES,
NOT YOUR FRIENDS,<i> ANYONE.</i>

20:26.648 --> 20:28.984
STAFFORD.

20:28.984 --> 20:32.221
WHAT HAPPENED?
IS SARA OKAY?
YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

20:32.221 --> 20:34.056
BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE.

20:34.056 --> 20:35.891
TOOK THIS
OUTSIDE HER PLACE TODAY.

20:39.061 --> 20:41.397
SORRY TO BE
THE MESSENGER HERE.

20:56.378 --> 20:58.747
LOOK, WE HAVE TO
DO BETTER THAN 5 TO 10.

20:58.747 --> 21:00.082
WHAT ABOUT A MURDER CHARGE?

21:00.082 --> 21:03.051
BRANDY KORSKAYA WAS WORKING WITH
THE FEDS. KARSTEN KNEW THAT.

21:03.051 --> 21:05.888
NOW, I'M SURE
HE HAD HER KILLED.
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

21:05.888 --> 21:08.557
THERE'S ZERO PROOF LINKING
KARSTEN TO KORSKAYA'S DEATH.

21:08.557 --> 21:10.793
IF THERE WERE,
THEN MAYBE WE'D STAND --

21:10.793 --> 21:14.730
STAFFORD, SO GLAD YOU
FINALLY DECIDED TO JOIN US.

21:17.399 --> 21:20.035
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, STAFFORD?!
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?!

21:22.771 --> 21:24.039
HEY, I NEED
SOME HELP IN HERE!

22:02.014 --> 22:04.350
I WENT BY TO CHECK ON HER.
I HEARD SHE'D BEEN THREATENED.

22:04.350 --> 22:06.785
LOOKS LIKE
MORE THAN CHECKING.
YEAH, WELL, IT WASN'T.

22:06.785 --> 22:09.955
UNTIL TODAY, I HADN'T
SEEN HER FOR WEEKS.

22:09.955 --> 22:11.857
IS THAT THE TRUTH?

22:13.158 --> 22:15.160
DO YOU REALLY THINK SHE'D
BE LIVING WITH YOU BACK HOME

22:15.160 --> 22:16.862
IF WE WERE STILL TOGETHER?

22:20.866 --> 22:22.534
SO YOU'RE NOT
SEEING HER?

22:22.534 --> 22:24.036
NO,
SHE MADE IT VERY CLEAR

22:24.036 --> 22:25.704
THAT SHE DIDN'T
WANT ME IN HER LIFE.

22:25.704 --> 22:27.139
WHO TOOK
THOSE PHOTOS ANYWAY?

22:27.139 --> 22:29.908
I HAD POLICE SURVEILLANCE
ON HER. I WAS WORRIED.

22:32.111 --> 22:34.113
YOU THINK
HE'LL MAKE A MOVE?

22:34.113 --> 22:36.115
KARSTEN?

22:36.115 --> 22:37.683
I KNOW HE WILL.

22:37.683 --> 22:40.853
THE MAN'S VENGEFUL,
AND HE'S GOT A LONG MEMORY.

22:40.853 --> 22:43.188
I'LL TELL YOU, IF HE GETS OUT
IN THREE TO FIVE,

22:43.188 --> 22:44.523
WE'LL BE LOOKING
OVER OUR SHOULDER

22:44.523 --> 22:46.158
FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES --

22:46.158 --> 22:50.162
AND NOT JUST US,
EVERYONE WE CARE ABOUT.

22:50.162 --> 22:52.197
SO,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

22:52.197 --> 22:54.533
LOOK, ZAREK PAWLOWSKI
ONCE TOLD ME

22:54.533 --> 22:56.068
THAT HE TOOK CARE
OF BRANDY.

22:56.068 --> 22:58.570
AND IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT
IT WAS UNDER KARSTEN'S REQUEST.

22:58.570 --> 23:01.006
BUT ZAREK IS GONE.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.841
THE FEDS SEARCHED
HIGH AND LOW FOR HIM

23:02.841 --> 23:04.510
TO GIVE A STATEMENT
AND TURNED UP NOTHING.

23:04.510 --> 23:07.346
AND WITHOUT ZAREK,
ALL WE'VE GOT IS HEARSAY.

23:07.346 --> 23:08.981
SO<i> WE</i> FIND HIM.

23:08.981 --> 23:12.484
I'M TELLING YOU, WE DO THAT,
WE GET KARSTEN FOR MURDER ONE

23:12.484 --> 23:14.820
AND HE GOES AWAY, NOT JUST
FOR A LITTLE WHILE --

23:14.820 --> 23:16.688
FOR GOOD.

23:20.059 --> 23:22.594
THREATS, HARASSMENT --

23:22.594 --> 23:25.230
THIS GUY MESSED
WITH THE WRONG PERSON.

23:25.230 --> 23:26.832
IT'S GONNA MAKE SOME JUICY COPY
FOR SOMEBODY.

23:26.832 --> 23:28.333
HEY, DID YOU GOT PHOTOS
OF ALL THIS?

23:28.333 --> 23:30.335
I FILED A POLICE REPORT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

23:30.335 --> 23:33.172
OH. I GOT YOU...

23:35.407 --> 23:37.576
...PEPPER SPRAY...

23:37.576 --> 23:39.912
MACE --
WAIT FOR IT...

23:39.912 --> 23:41.580
OKAY --
...MINI TASER.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.449
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CLEAN?
YOU GOT TO FIGHT BACK.

23:43.449 --> 23:45.951
YOU SHOW KARSTEN
YOU'RE NOT SCARED.

23:45.951 --> 23:48.287
I MEAN, THREATENING YOU
TO GET TO JACK?

23:48.287 --> 23:49.588
HOW COWARDLY IS THAT?

23:49.588 --> 23:52.057
THERE WAS NO POINT.
JACK WON'T BACK DOWN.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.392
YOU SPOKE TO JACK?

23:53.392 --> 23:55.260
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH HIM FOR WEEKS.

23:55.260 --> 23:58.764
YEAH, HE --
HE CAME BY THE STUDIO.

23:58.764 --> 24:01.733
HE WANTED TO...
CHECK I WAS OKAY.

24:01.733 --> 24:05.070
HEY, UM...

24:05.070 --> 24:08.073
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT,

24:08.073 --> 24:10.909
BUT, LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

24:10.909 --> 24:13.245
W-WHY DID YOU GUYS
BREAK UP?

24:13.245 --> 24:16.415
JACK GOT INTO THIS SITUATION
WHERE DREW WAS CONVINCED

24:16.415 --> 24:18.917
THAT HE DID SOMETHING,
SOMETHING CRIMINAL,

24:18.917 --> 24:21.153
EVEN THOUGH JACK WAS
COMPLETELY INNOCENT.

24:21.153 --> 24:23.722
AND DREW
WOULDN'T DROP IT?

24:23.722 --> 24:26.058
NO, SO...

24:26.058 --> 24:30.295
I PROMISED
NEVER TO SEE JACK AGAIN.

24:30.295 --> 24:34.133
AND THE TRUTH IS THAT WHEN
I FINALLY ENDED IT WITH HIM,

24:34.133 --> 24:37.636
PART OF ME FELT RELIEVED, LIKE
BOTH OF US SHOULD JUST MOVE ON.

24:37.636 --> 24:41.306
AND THEN I SEE HIM TODAY
AND ALL THAT GOES OUT THE WINDOW

24:41.306 --> 24:44.143
AND THE FEELING
COMES RIGHT BACK.

24:47.513 --> 24:50.249
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE GO
THEIR WHOLE LIVES

24:50.249 --> 24:52.618
AND NEVER FEEL
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

25:05.831 --> 25:08.333
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I'M GOING TO JULES.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.169
WHY?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

25:10.169 --> 25:12.804
DON'T COME NEAR ME.
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

25:12.804 --> 25:14.973
THE WHOLE DAMN TIME, IT WAS YOU,

25:14.973 --> 25:17.843
AND YOU LET T.J. TAKE THE BLAME,
AND -- AND DAD --

25:17.843 --> 25:20.112
I DIDN'T LET ANYONE.
OH, YOU ARE SO FULL OF CRAP.

25:20.112 --> 25:23.115
AND NOW YOU'VE
GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT.

25:23.115 --> 25:25.117
CONGRATULATIONS.

25:25.117 --> 25:27.719
YOU MAKE ME SICK.

25:34.726 --> 25:36.562
YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE
TAKEN ONE CAR.

25:36.562 --> 25:39.898
LET'S NOT TAKE THIS WHOLE
WORKING-TOGETHER THING TOO FAR.

25:39.898 --> 25:42.234
IT'S NICE THE WAY YOU GUNNED IT
PAST ME AT THE LIGHT.

25:42.234 --> 25:44.169
YOU GONNA CUT ME OFF
AT EVERY INTERSECTION?

25:44.169 --> 25:46.338
DAMN STRAIGHT.

25:48.574 --> 25:50.409
NO ONE'S SEEN HIM
IN MONTHS.

25:50.409 --> 25:52.077
I'M GUESSING
HE CLEARED OUT OF TOWN

25:52.077 --> 25:53.745
AND IS LAYING LOW
SOMEWHERE.

26:08.727 --> 26:11.897
WHAT IS THAT?

26:11.897 --> 26:13.899
IT SMELLS
LIKE A ZOO IN HERE.

26:20.672 --> 26:22.507
MAYBE HE WENT BACK
TO THE MOTHERLAND.

26:42.661 --> 26:45.831
WHAT KIND OF GUY LEAVES
HIS DOG AT HOME TO STARVE?

26:45.831 --> 26:49.368
A GUY WHO DOESN'T KNOW
HE'S NOT COMING BACK.

26:50.969 --> 26:54.306
JOHN DOE FOUND IN
ABANDONED VEHICLE LAST WEEK?

26:54.306 --> 26:55.974
NO, THAT'S NOT HIM.

26:55.974 --> 27:01.313
THIS ONE WAS FOUND
IN A BURNED-DOWN BUILDING.

27:01.313 --> 27:03.649
RIGHT TIME FRAME.

27:03.649 --> 27:07.452
YEAH, BUT HIS HEIGHT -- 5"7'.
HE'S TOO SHORT.

27:07.452 --> 27:10.789
SO, LET ME ASK YOU...

27:10.789 --> 27:12.291
ZAREK --
HE COMES AFTER YOU

27:12.291 --> 27:14.459
AND SAYS, "OH, BY THE WAY,
I OFFED BRANDY."

27:14.459 --> 27:16.628
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT THEN?

27:16.628 --> 27:18.897
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY PROOF.

27:20.565 --> 27:21.900
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:21.900 --> 27:24.903
I TURNED A BLIND EYE
TO A LOT OF THINGS.

27:24.903 --> 27:27.439
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.

27:32.844 --> 27:35.180
BODY HERE --
DUMPED IN A RIVER,

27:35.180 --> 27:37.349
MISSING ITS HEAD
AND ITS HANDS.

27:39.484 --> 27:42.654
NO DENTAL RECORDS,
NO FINGERPRINTS.

27:42.654 --> 27:44.823
COULD BE HIM, BUT NO WAY
TO KNOW FOR SURE --

27:44.823 --> 27:47.025
WAIT. WAIT.

27:47.025 --> 27:49.528
THAT'S FROM THE
POLISH NATIONAL COAT OF ARMS.

27:49.528 --> 27:51.863
IT'S THE SAME THING
THAT'S ON HIS WALL.

27:53.932 --> 27:56.601
WITHOUT ZAREK TO TESTIFY, WE
CAN'T CONNECT KARSTEN TO BRANDY.

27:56.601 --> 27:57.936
THERE'S NO MURDER CHARGE.

27:57.936 --> 28:00.272
DOESN'T MATTER. NOW WE<i> KNOW</i>
KARSTEN KILLED ZAREK.

28:00.272 --> 28:02.107
NO DOUBT KARSTEN'S
A KILLER,

28:02.107 --> 28:03.875
BUT CHOPPING OFF A GUY'S
HEAD AND HANDS

28:03.875 --> 28:06.878
AND DUMPING HIM IN A RIVER?
HE'S GOT PEOPLE WHO
TAKE CARE OF THE DETAILS.

28:06.878 --> 28:09.381
PEOPLE LIKE YOU, YOU MEAN?
I NEVER DID ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

28:09.381 --> 28:11.216
YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN.

28:11.216 --> 28:13.218
LOOK, THERE WERE LINES
I NEVER CROSSED,

28:13.218 --> 28:15.554
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
HE WANTED ME TO,

28:15.554 --> 28:18.357
WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE
WITH YOU. YOU GOT IT?

28:18.357 --> 28:22.361
OKAY, THEN. HOW DO WE CONNECT
KARSTEN WITH THE MURDER

28:22.361 --> 28:23.929
WITH A DEAD TRIGGER MAN
AND NO HARD EVIDENCE?

28:25.964 --> 28:29.501
YOU'RE THE FIXER.
FIX IT.

28:39.448 --> 28:41.117
YOU SHOT ZAREK,

28:41.117 --> 28:43.386
THEN HAD HIS BODY DUMPED
IN THE RIVER,

28:43.386 --> 28:45.482
MINUS
THE HEAD AND HANDS.

28:45.482 --> 28:47.284
JACK'S RECOUNTED
THE WHOLE THING.

28:47.284 --> 28:49.353
HOW THE HELL DID HE COME UP
WITH ALL THAT?

28:49.353 --> 28:52.356
HE SAYS
HE SAW YOU DO IT.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.258
HE'S CLAIMING
HE WAS THERE.

28:57.427 --> 29:00.430
I DIDN'T THINK
HE HAD THE STONES.

29:00.430 --> 29:03.433
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

29:12.461 --> 29:14.178
<i>WITAJ PRZYJACIELU.</i>

29:14.178 --> 29:16.180
<i>WITAJ PRZYJACIELU.</i>

29:19.016 --> 29:21.018
COME.

29:21.018 --> 29:23.120
<i>MUSIMY POROZMAWIAC.</i>

29:23.120 --> 29:25.789
OF COURSE.

29:25.789 --> 29:28.959
WATCH THE STORE,
PLEASE, NOAH.

29:31.862 --> 29:36.033
THESE YOUNG MEN --
THEY HAVE NO IDEA.

29:36.033 --> 29:38.202
THEY NEVER STRUGGLED.

29:38.202 --> 29:41.705
HOW SHARPER
THAN A SERPENT'S TOOTH IT IS

29:41.705 --> 29:43.874
TO HAVE
A THANKLESS CHILD.

29:43.874 --> 29:46.510
THIS IS TRUE.

29:48.712 --> 29:51.215
MY SON HATES ME.

29:52.549 --> 29:55.552
THAT CRAZY BOY
IN THERE, NOAH --

29:55.552 --> 29:59.189
HE'S EASIER TO TALK TO
THAN MY OWN SON.

29:59.189 --> 30:01.191
SCREW THEM.

30:01.191 --> 30:04.928
SOMEDAY, THEY WILL BE
OLD MEN LIKE US.

30:04.928 --> 30:07.497
THEN THEY WILL SEE.

30:07.497 --> 30:09.833
YEAH.

30:09.833 --> 30:12.002
BUT BY THEN,
WE'LL BE DEAD.

30:14.371 --> 30:16.540
<i>NA ZDROWIE.</i>

30:20.677 --> 30:24.014
RIGHT NOW,
WE ARE STILL ALIVE, MY FRIEND.

30:24.014 --> 30:27.684
HIS NAME IS MIKOLAJ.

30:27.684 --> 30:30.220
HE'S THE MAN YOU NEED.

30:30.220 --> 30:34.224
WHEN THE BRANCH IS ROTTEN,
YOU MUST CUT IT OFF

30:34.224 --> 30:38.061
BEFORE IT INFECTS
EVERYTHING.

30:45.869 --> 30:48.205
HEY, DON'T ANSWER
YOUR PHONE MUCH?

30:48.205 --> 30:50.207
HEY.
I'M SORRY. I'VE BEEN BUSY.

30:50.207 --> 30:51.875
IN FACT, I GOT TO BE
SOMEWHERE RIGHT NOW.

30:51.875 --> 30:53.543
I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

30:53.543 --> 30:55.979
IT'S ABOUT THAT THING
YOU ASKED ME TO LOOK INTO --

30:55.979 --> 30:58.048
YOU KNOW, YOUR PARENTS.

30:58.048 --> 30:59.716
YEAH, THEY DIED
IN A KARSTEN ALLIED

30:59.716 --> 31:02.319
CONSTRUCTION ACCIDENT --
BUILDING COLLAPSED.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.821
I KNOW THAT ALREADY.
YEAH, PRECISELY.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.291
THAT'S IT.
WHAT'S<i> IT?</i>

31:07.291 --> 31:09.293
THAT'S ALL
THE AVAILABLE INFO.

31:09.293 --> 31:13.397
I CHECKED CITY RECORDS,
HOSPITAL ARCHIVES -- NADA.

31:13.397 --> 31:17.067
NO ACCIDENT REPORT, NO POLICE
REPORT, NO DEATH CERTIFICATES.

31:17.067 --> 31:19.736
YOUR PARENTS
WERE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS,

31:19.736 --> 31:21.605
EASIER TO MAKE DISAPPEAR.

31:21.605 --> 31:24.641
EVEN THE BUILDING-CODE PAPERWORK
WAS DESTROYED IN A FIRE

31:24.641 --> 31:27.144
ONE WEEK
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

31:27.144 --> 31:29.346
SOMEONE SCRUBBED IT ALL.

31:29.346 --> 31:30.847
NOT SOMEONE.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.250
I'M SORRY.
I KNOW HE RAISED YOU.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.518
YOU WANT THIS NOW?

31:35.986 --> 31:37.654
THANKS FOR
LOOKING INTO IT.

31:37.654 --> 31:39.823
YOU GOING TO THE OPENING?

31:39.823 --> 31:41.425
WHAT?

31:41.425 --> 31:42.926
SARA'S OPENING.

31:42.926 --> 31:44.594
UH, NO. NO.

31:44.594 --> 31:46.363
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

31:46.363 --> 31:47.931
YOU KNOW, I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

31:47.931 --> 31:51.768
BUT, UM, SARA HAD TO
BREAK THINGS OFF WITH YOU.

31:51.768 --> 31:53.270
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO.

31:53.270 --> 31:54.871
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

31:54.871 --> 31:57.374
NOT MUCH MORE.
YOU SHOULD ASK HER.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.110
OPENING GOES TILL 9:00.

32:18.328 --> 32:20.497
YOU SURE
HE'S STILL HERE.

32:20.497 --> 32:25.502
HE SAID HE'D WAIT.
HE SOUNDED VERY UPSET.

32:25.502 --> 32:29.840
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, T.J.,
LOOKING OUT FOR HIM LIKE THIS.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.842
THAT'S LOYALTY.

32:31.842 --> 32:33.810
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT.

32:37.514 --> 32:39.182
THERE HE IS.

32:46.390 --> 32:48.892
GRANDPA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:48.892 --> 32:51.561
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
WE BOTH WERE.

32:51.561 --> 32:53.230
W-WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:53.230 --> 32:55.165
Y-Y-YOU SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT VAL?

32:55.165 --> 32:57.834
YEAH, JUST THAT
SHE HATES ME NOW --

32:57.834 --> 33:00.404
EVERYBODY DOES.
THEY DON'T HATE YOU.

33:00.404 --> 33:02.239
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:04.674 --> 33:09.346
I DID
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

33:09.346 --> 33:11.615
YOU MEAN
WHAT HAPPENED TO LOU?

33:11.615 --> 33:13.817
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

33:16.420 --> 33:18.422
SO MUCH FOR
KEEPING IT A SECRET.

33:18.422 --> 33:21.892
HEY. YOU DON'T
KEEP SECRETS FROM FAMILY.

33:21.892 --> 33:24.027
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING
IS MY FAULT.

33:24.027 --> 33:25.862
NO, IT ISN'T.

33:25.862 --> 33:29.366
YOU'RE NOT TO BLAME
FOR ANY OF THIS.

33:29.366 --> 33:32.469
LOU HAD A VICIOUS TEMPER.
WE ALL KNEW THAT.

33:32.469 --> 33:35.105
HE COULD HAVE
HURT YOU BADLY.

33:35.105 --> 33:38.442
YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO
TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

33:38.442 --> 33:40.143
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE YOU WRONG.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.879
IT MAKES YOU HUMAN.

33:45.315 --> 33:48.618
YOUR FATHER IS RIGHT
TO PROTECT YOU.

33:48.618 --> 33:51.121
THAT'S WHAT A FATHER
IS SUPPOSED TO DO.

33:51.121 --> 33:55.459
ONLY, EVER SINCE THAT WOMAN
CAME INTO HIS LIFE,

33:55.459 --> 33:58.061
HE CAN'T SEEM TO GET
HIS PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.

33:58.061 --> 34:01.097
JERZY SAYS YOU KNOW
HOW TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTION.

34:02.566 --> 34:04.901
THE OLD MAN DOES NOT LIE.

34:08.004 --> 34:10.674
QUICK AND PAINLESS.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.476
AND NOT IN THE FACE.

34:12.476 --> 34:15.612
HE WANTS IT TO BE
AN OPEN CASKET. OKAY, MIKOLAJ?

34:21.918 --> 34:25.188
INSTEAD OF PROTECTING
THE FAMILY, HE'S DESTROYING IT.

34:29.759 --> 34:34.097
LIFE CAN FORCE YOU INTO MAKING
A VERY HARD CHOICE...

34:39.603 --> 34:40.737
...EVEN IF THAT CHOICE

34:40.737 --> 34:43.740
IS THE LAST THING
YOU EVER WANTED TO DO.

34:58.518 --> 35:00.854
ALL THESE PEOPLE WANT TO
COME TO SEE YOUR PICTURES?

35:00.854 --> 35:02.522
YEAH,
I GUESS THEY DO.

35:02.522 --> 35:06.499
DID YOU TAKE ANY,
LIKE, SPORTS?
UM, NO.

35:06.499 --> 35:08.533
LOOK AT THIS CROWD.

35:08.533 --> 35:11.036
I KNOW. I KNOW. YOU HATE CROWDS.
HERE -- CROWD MEDICINE.

35:11.036 --> 35:12.370
OH,
THAT'S THE FIRST PROJECT

35:12.370 --> 35:14.439
YOUR MOM AND I
EVER WORKED ON TOGETHER.

35:14.439 --> 35:16.174
IS THAT
WHEN YOU GOT ARRESTED?

35:16.174 --> 35:17.676
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
I DID.

35:17.676 --> 35:20.378
BADGE OF HONOR. YOU KNOW
YOUR MOM'S A BADASS, RIGHT?

35:20.378 --> 35:23.548
YOU KNOW, THIS -- ALL OF THIS
IS ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT.

35:23.548 --> 35:25.884
NO, OUTLAW. ALL YOU.

35:25.884 --> 35:28.520
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY
IN YOUR SPEECH?
WHAT SPEECH?

35:28.520 --> 35:31.423
THEY'RE GIVING YOU AN AWARD.
YOU GOT TO SAY SOMETHING...

35:31.423 --> 35:32.591
NO SPEECH.

35:32.591 --> 35:34.259
ALL RIGHT, KIDDO.

35:34.259 --> 35:37.028
SEE THAT LOVELY CREATURE
AT THE DESSERT TABLE?

35:37.028 --> 35:38.697
THE LADY, YOU MEAN?
YEAH.

35:38.697 --> 35:40.866
WE'RE GONNA GO
TALK TO HER.
SURE.

35:40.866 --> 35:43.735
AND LOOK, ANY JOKE I MAKE,
YOU LAUGH AT LIKE IT'S SO FUNNY,

35:43.735 --> 35:45.237
AND THEN YOU TELL HER
HOW AWESOME I AM

35:45.237 --> 35:47.739
BECAUSE I BUILD FORTS
WITH YOU AFTER SCHOOL.

35:47.739 --> 35:50.575
BUT YOU DON'T DO THAT.
DOESN'T MATTER.
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

35:50.575 --> 35:53.812
DRINK UP. IT'LL HELP YOU
WITH THE SPEECH.

36:03.121 --> 36:04.623
HEY, JACK.

36:04.623 --> 36:06.792
HEY.
COLD NIGHT.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.293
IT'S LIKE SUMMER
IN DUBLIN.

36:09.961 --> 36:12.130
LET'S GO OVER HERE.

36:53.538 --> 36:56.141
DROP IT!

36:56.141 --> 36:57.976
NOW!

37:05.817 --> 37:07.152
CLEAR!

37:10.822 --> 37:12.057
LET'S GO.

37:12.057 --> 37:14.893
HEY, MAN. NICE FALL.

37:14.893 --> 37:17.629
KEVLAR, EH?

37:17.629 --> 37:19.664
IT'D BE A DAMN SHAME IF HIS AIM
WERE A BIT HIGHER.

37:20.799 --> 37:21.900
WELL DONE, JACK.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.736
THANKS, ORESTES.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

37:24.736 --> 37:26.838
GOT IT ALL RIGHT HERE.

37:26.838 --> 37:29.341
WE GET THIS BASTARD TO ADMIT
HE'S WORKING WITH KARSTEN,

37:29.341 --> 37:32.344
NAIL HIM ON CONSPIRACY
TO COMMIT MURDER. DONE.

37:32.344 --> 37:34.479
EVERYBODY GETS
WHAT THEY WANTED.

37:34.479 --> 37:37.616
GUESS YOU COULD
SAY THAT.

37:42.754 --> 37:46.191
YOU GOOD?
SOMEWHERE I GOT TO BE.

37:46.191 --> 37:47.859
JUST HELP ME
GET THIS THING OFF.

37:47.859 --> 37:51.029
NO MORE LOOKING OVER
OUR SHOULDERS. KARSTEN'S DONE.

37:53.031 --> 37:54.599
I THOUGHT
I COULD STAY.

37:54.599 --> 37:57.302
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE,
AND YOU SAW THE FUN PART.

37:57.302 --> 37:59.304
ANYWAY, JANEY'S HERE.
SHE'S GONNA PUT YOU TO BED.

37:59.304 --> 38:02.140
AW, MOM.
SHE SAID SHE'S GONNA
READ YOU TWO BOOKS.

38:02.140 --> 38:03.508
OKAY.

38:03.508 --> 38:05.010
HI, SARA.
HEY.

38:05.010 --> 38:07.045
HI, OLIVER.
HEY.

38:07.045 --> 38:10.548
OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
BYE, LOVE BUG.
BYE, MOM.

38:10.548 --> 38:12.050
BYE.
BYE.

38:12.050 --> 38:15.320
MY MOM SAID TWO BOOKS.
OKAY, THEN.

38:51.122 --> 38:52.958
JACK!

38:52.958 --> 38:55.794
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO COME.
WHERE'S SARA?

38:55.794 --> 38:58.496
UH, SHE STEPPED OUT FOR A
MINUTE. SHE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

39:20.151 --> 39:23.288
YOU KNOW, I'M -- I'M ACTUALLY
GONNA GO AND FIND HER.

39:33.698 --> 39:36.267
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
