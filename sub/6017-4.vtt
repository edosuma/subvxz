00:02.068 --> 00:03.296
To me, government...

00:04.871 --> 00:06.566
...is basically parents for adults.

00:07.207 --> 00:10.404
Especially the IRS. The IRS is like
Ward and June Cleaver...

00:11.011 --> 00:13.605
...and we're all
Wally and the Beaver.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.645
And your accountant
is Eddie Haskell...

00:15.815 --> 00:18.511
...showing you all these neat tricks
to get away with stuff.

00:19.252 --> 00:20.844
That's fine, unless you get audited.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.546
Then you don't want some
wise guy in a suit going:

00:23.723 --> 00:27.022
"You have a very
lovely office here, sir."

00:27.260 --> 00:30.525
Because jail is the government's
way of sending you to your room.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.133
And when you meet Whitey
and Lumpy in the joint...

00:34.968 --> 00:38.199
...there's really gonna be
something wrong with the Beaver.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.871
-Does he like you?
-What do you think?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.173
-Do you like him?
-Yeah, I like him. Definitely.

00:48.348 --> 00:49.576
I like him a lot.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.309
-So, what's wrong with him?
-Nothing, and I've looked.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.749
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.718
-So how'd you meet him?
-In the office.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.721
-So he's a writer?
-Yeah.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.690
-Yeah, big surprise.
-I was sitting on the reception desk.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.920
I was looking pretty hot.

01:04.096 --> 01:06.964
-I was wearing my slingback pumps.
-What are those?

01:07.133 --> 01:09.897
Ask your mother.
You live with her now, don't you?

01:10.603 --> 01:12.127
Anyway...

01:12.305 --> 01:15.297
...then this guy comes up to me,
and he starts feeling my jacket...

01:15.475 --> 01:17.966
...between his thumb
and forefinger like this.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.544
-So, what'd you do?
-I said, "What do you think?"

01:20.713 --> 01:22.203
And he said, "Gabardine?"

01:22.382 --> 01:25.249
And I said, "Yeah." That was it.

01:27.187 --> 01:30.054
-Just felt your material?
-Yeah. Jake Jarmel.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.021
-Sounds like a cool guy.
-Sounds like a jerk.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.923
Felt your material, come on.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.031
-Jerry, where'd you get that sweater?
-In the back of my closet.

01:39.199 --> 01:42.168
I think that's what the back
of closets are for.

01:43.169 --> 01:44.659
Hey, that's Barry.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.362
Lookit. Barry.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.073
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.971
-Who is that?
-That's Barry Prophet, our accountant.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.612
I don't know how can you let
this guy handle your money.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.806
Not my money. He handles
Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.541
-Barry, how you doing?
-How are you?

01:58.718 --> 02:00.117
-This is my friend George.
-Hey.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.083
What are you doing
in this neighborhood?

02:02.255 --> 02:03.779
Nothing, really.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.551
-You... You eat here?
-Yeah.

02:06.726 --> 02:09.455
-So how's my money?
-Well, it's still green.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.529
-What, do you got a cold?
-No. No.

02:12.232 --> 02:15.633
-Look at that ring.
-Oh, you like that?

02:17.504 --> 02:18.994
Hey, say, where's the bathroom?

02:19.172 --> 02:21.163
Bathroom?
Bathroom's right over there.

02:21.341 --> 02:23.036
Great.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.139
Did you see that?

02:26.312 --> 02:28.177
-See what?
-Yes, I saw that.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.316
-What?
-What was all that sniffing?

02:30.483 --> 02:32.576
-I don't know.
-You don't think..?

02:32.752 --> 02:35.118
Oh, no. Come on, Jerry.

02:35.288 --> 02:37.916
He was definitely sniffing.

02:38.858 --> 02:41.326
I mean, what if..?
This guy's got all my money.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.428
Plus, I got some of Kramer's money
with him.

02:43.596 --> 02:45.723
He can write checks to himself
from my account.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.367
I've known this guy since college.
He doesn't do drugs.

02:48.535 --> 02:51.663
-Then what was all that sniffing?
-Maybe it's the cold weather.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.237
Today's not cold.

02:53.406 --> 02:56.432
All right, I gotta get going.
My parents are expecting me.

02:56.609 --> 03:00.340
Don't forget to wash
your hands before supper.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.952
What do you need
all that ketchup for?

03:09.556 --> 03:11.683
This is my ketchup.

03:12.091 --> 03:13.456
I bought this ketchup...

03:13.626 --> 03:16.652
...just so I could have
as much as I want.

03:19.098 --> 03:22.363
So I...
I talked to Phil Kassikoff today.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.059
Phil Kassikoff?

03:24.237 --> 03:26.398
Yeah. You know, my friend,
the bra salesman?

03:26.940 --> 03:28.874
He says they're looking
for somebody...

03:29.042 --> 03:31.602
...so I got you an interview
next Friday with his boss.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.871
-Next Friday? What time?
-Two o'clock.

03:34.447 --> 03:37.814
That's my whole afternoon.
I was gonna look for sneakers.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.952
You can look for sneakers
the next day!

03:41.554 --> 03:44.148
He doesn't know anything
about bras.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.161
I know a little.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.559
Besides, what do you
have to know?

03:51.731 --> 03:55.997
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in
and be able to discuss it intelligently.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.296
Maybe you should take a look
at a few bras.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.405
Where's your bra?
Give him a bra to look at.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.006
I'm not giving him a bra.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.338
-Why not?
-I don't need him looking at my bra.

04:05.511 --> 04:07.172
Fine. He'll go into the interview...

04:07.347 --> 04:09.372
...he wouldn't know
what he's talking about.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.312
Do we have to..?

04:11.484 --> 04:13.543
You don't even know
what they're made from.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.247
-They're made from Lycra spandex.
-Get out of here. Lycra spandex?

04:17.423 --> 04:19.721
I think they are made
from Lycra spandex.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.791
-Wanna bet? How much?
-I'm not betting.

04:21.961 --> 04:25.863
-Take a look.
-All right, I'll get a bra.

04:26.032 --> 04:28.899
I don't know what the big problem is
getting a bra.

04:29.068 --> 04:30.592
She doesn't wanna get a bra.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.664
I'm not saying, "Go to the library
and read the history."

04:33.840 --> 04:36.741
But it wouldn't kill you
to know a little bit about it.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.070
All right, it wouldn't kill me.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.149
How long does it take to find a bra?

04:44.550 --> 04:46.211
What's going on in there?

04:46.386 --> 04:49.685
You ask me to get a pair of
underwear, I'm back in two seconds.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.618
You know about the cup sizes
and all?

04:55.795 --> 05:00.164
-They have different cups.
-Yeah, I know about the cups.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.170
You got the A...

05:05.838 --> 05:07.169
...the B...

05:07.340 --> 05:08.898
...the C...

05:09.309 --> 05:11.743
...the D. That's the biggest.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.879
I know the D is the biggest.

05:15.048 --> 05:18.814
I base my whole life on knowing
that the D is the biggest.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.283
-Here. Here's the bra.
-Let me see it.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.979
"One hundred percent
Lycra spandex."

05:24.157 --> 05:26.148
-Let me see.
-I told you.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.557
Here. You think you know
everything.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.757
That's surprising.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.094
All right, what else?

05:35.268 --> 05:37.600
You got the cups in the front...

05:37.770 --> 05:40.432
...two loops in the back, all right?

05:40.606 --> 05:44.167
-I guess that's about it.
-I got it. Cups in front, loops in back.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.778
You got ketchup on it.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.220
Sniffing? What do you mean,
sniffing?

05:55.388 --> 05:58.516
-Sniffing. With his nose.
-Jerry, he probably had a cold.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.660
-No, he didn't. I asked him.
-So, what are you saying?

06:01.828 --> 06:05.025
-I don't know. You know, what if..?
-Drugs?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.393
-You think he's on drugs?
-I don't know.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.296
-Jerry...
-All I know is he was sniffing.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.596
-Listen, we went in on a CD together.
-I know.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.238
And Newman gave you money too.

06:13.406 --> 06:16.000
See, I didn't even meet this guy.
We trusted you.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.405
Look, it doesn't necessarily
mean anything yet.

06:18.578 --> 06:21.479
-It just means he was sniffing.
-Well, what else? Was he nervous?

06:21.647 --> 06:25.413
Did he use a lot of slang?
Did he use the word "man"?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.885
No, he didn't use "man."

06:29.055 --> 06:32.081
I mean, when he was leaving,
did he say, "I'm splitting"?

06:32.959 --> 06:35.427
No, but at one point,
he did use the bathroom.

06:39.665 --> 06:42.293
-You think that's a bad sign?
-Yes, that's what they do.

06:42.468 --> 06:43.935
They live in the bathroom.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.571
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna get our money, right?

06:46.739 --> 06:48.673
I don't know.
This sweater really itches me.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.570
-You want it?
-Yeah.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.910
Hello. Hel...

06:59.018 --> 07:00.815
Well, you notice anything?

07:00.987 --> 07:03.581
You have cleaned up
the whole apartment...

07:03.756 --> 07:05.690
...and you're making dinner.
You're perfect.

07:05.858 --> 07:08.418
You're a perfect man.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.900
-Did anyone call?
-You got a few messages.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.864
-I wrote them down.
-Where are they?

07:17.036 --> 07:20.472
Let's see, they are...
Here they are.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.574
Thank you.

07:22.742 --> 07:25.404
Oh, yeah. I'll call you back.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.714
Forget that...
Myra had the baby!

07:29.882 --> 07:31.509
Oh, my God. That's wonderful.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.015
-Who called?
-She did.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.518
She did? Oh, that's so great.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.220
-Where do you keep the corkscrew?
-It's in the drawer on the right.

07:43.362 --> 07:44.795
What?

07:44.997 --> 07:46.555
No, it's nothing.

07:46.732 --> 07:48.962
-No, what is it?
-It's nothing.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.725
Tell me.

07:51.270 --> 07:55.832
Well, I was just curious why you
didn't use an exclamation point.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.573
What are you talking about?

07:59.745 --> 08:02.077
Well, see right here? You wrote,
"Myra had the baby."

08:02.248 --> 08:05.046
But you didn't use
an exclamation point.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.810
So?

08:06.986 --> 08:09.477
So it's... Yeah, it's nothing.
Forget it. Forget it.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.623
You know, I just found it curious.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.453
Wait, what's so curious about it?

08:14.627 --> 08:18.563
Well, I mean, if one of your
close friends had a baby...

08:18.731 --> 08:21.996
...and I left you a message about it,
I would use an exclamation point.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.295
Well, maybe I don't use
my exclamation points...

08:24.470 --> 08:26.597
...as haphazardly as you do.

08:27.573 --> 08:30.269
You don't think
that someone having a baby...

08:30.443 --> 08:32.274
...warrants an exclamation point?

08:32.445 --> 08:34.379
Hey, look, I just jotted down
the message.

08:34.547 --> 08:37.914
I didn't know that I was required
to capture the mood of each caller.

08:38.251 --> 08:42.482
Well, I just thought you'd be a little
more excited about a friend of mine...

08:42.655 --> 08:44.623
...having a baby.
-Okay, I'm excited.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.122
I just don't happen to like
exclamation points.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.284
Well, Jake, you should
learn to use them.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.329
Like, the way I'm talking now,
I'd put exclamation points...

08:52.498 --> 08:55.990
...on the ends all of these sentences!
On this one! And on that one!

08:56.168 --> 08:58.500
Well, you can put one on this one:

08:58.671 --> 09:00.195
I'm leaving!

09:05.578 --> 09:07.375
-You're out of your mind.
-Why?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.481
It's an exclamation point.

09:09.649 --> 09:13.278
-It's a line with a dot under it.
-Well, I felt it called for one.

09:13.452 --> 09:15.750
"Called for one." I thought
I'd heard of everything.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.914
I never heard of a relationship
being affected by punctuation.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.753
I found it very troubling
that he didn't use one.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.724
George is right.
Didn't take you long.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.236
Anything new with that guy
on drugs?

09:31.671 --> 09:33.263
He's not on drugs.

09:33.439 --> 09:37.500
Then why the sniffing?
Who walks around... sniffing?

09:37.677 --> 09:39.770
All right, here.
You call him right now, okay?

09:39.946 --> 09:43.177
-See if he's sniffing right now.
-Good idea.

09:47.687 --> 09:50.520
-<i>Prophet and Goldstein.</i>
-Yes, Barry Prophet, please.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.521
<i>I'm sorry, he's out of town
this week.</i>

09:52.692 --> 09:55.252
-Out of town?
-<i>Yes. He went to South America.</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:57.919
-South America?
-South America?

09:58.097 --> 09:59.758
I'll call back. Thank you.

09:59.932 --> 10:03.026
-He went to South America.
-Yeah!

10:04.003 --> 10:05.436
So what?

10:05.771 --> 10:09.673
-Who goes to South America?
-People go to South America.

10:09.842 --> 10:13.141
Yeah, and they come back with
things taped to their large intestine.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.775
So because of a few bad apples...

10:15.948 --> 10:18.143
...you're gonna impugn
an entire continent?

10:18.317 --> 10:20.217
Yes, I'm impugning a continent.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.786
Well, I say we go and get
our money right now.

10:23.255 --> 10:26.122
-Hey. Hey.
-Hello, Newman.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.283
Hello, Jerry.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.993
So any news?

10:30.162 --> 10:32.323
Yeah, he skipped out
and... went to South America.

10:32.498 --> 10:33.726
South America?!

10:33.899 --> 10:37.164
What kind of snow blower
did you get us mixed up with?

10:37.637 --> 10:41.437
Okay, gentlemen, the fact remains
you still have no proof.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.905
This is all speculation and hearsay.

10:44.076 --> 10:47.341
Wait. There's one way to find out.
We set up a sting.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.777
You know, like Abscam.
Like Abscam, Jerry.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.613
What are you gonna do?

10:53.786 --> 10:57.187
You gonna put on phony beards
and dress up like Arab sheiks...

10:57.356 --> 10:59.119
...and sit around
in some hotel room?

10:59.291 --> 11:01.691
-I mean, come on.
-Wait a second.

11:01.861 --> 11:04.022
Maybe there is a way to tempt him
and find out.

11:04.196 --> 11:08.257
If we put our three heads together,
we should come up with something.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.074

11:17.677 --> 11:20.441
-What's today?
-It's Thursday.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.012
Really?

11:22.181 --> 11:24.274
Feels like Tuesday.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.817
Tuesday has no feel.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.147
Monday has a feel.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.050
Friday has a feel.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.451
Sunday has a feel.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.458
-I feel Tuesday and Wednesday.
-Shut up, the both of you.

11:35.628 --> 11:36.959
You're making me nervous.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.965
Where is he already? He should've
been out of work by now.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.532
Hey, this is kind of fun.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.398
Yeah. Maybe we ought to become
private detectives.

11:45.571 --> 11:46.970
Yeah, maybe you should.

11:47.139 --> 11:50.199
-Maybe I will.
-Yeah, me too.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.440
All right, what are you
gonna say to him?

11:52.611 --> 11:54.977
Just gonna find out
if he's interested.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.774
Hey, maybe I should go in with him.

11:56.949 --> 11:59.008
-No, you stay in the car.
-Who made you leader?

11:59.185 --> 12:02.677
All right, Newman. One more peep
out of you, you're out of the operation.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.948
There he is.
He's going into that bar.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.822
All right...

12:11.630 --> 12:13.723
...I'm going in.
-Be careful, Kramer.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.400
I should've gone in with him.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.630
No, you stay here in the car.
I may need you.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.330
What do you need me
in the car for?

12:22.508 --> 12:25.033
I might need you to get me a soda.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.118
I'll have a brewski, Charlie.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.154
The name's Mitch.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.987
Well, there's nothing like a cold one
after a long day, huh?

12:42.161 --> 12:43.992
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

12:44.163 --> 12:47.257
Yeah, I've been known to drink
a beer or two.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.799
But then again, I've been known
to do a lot of things.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.982
-Cigarette?
-No, no. I never touch them.

13:05.384 --> 13:06.612
Well...

13:06.786 --> 13:09.880
...I suck them down like Coca-Cola.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.019
Well...

13:13.192 --> 13:16.127
...here's to feeling good
all the time, huh?

13:33.846 --> 13:37.009
Looks like you got yourself
a little cold there, huh, fella?

13:37.183 --> 13:40.209
-I don't think so.
-Me neither.

13:47.593 --> 13:50.323
You should try this new
dental floss, Glide. It's fantastic.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.726
-I use Dentotape.
-You should try this.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.896
-I don't wanna.
-Not even once?

13:56.402 --> 13:59.667
-No.
-You know, you're an idiot.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.363
Why, because I use Dentotape?

14:01.540 --> 14:05.203
Right. Anyone who uses Dentotape
is an idiot.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.407
-South America, huh?
-Yeah, yeah.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.979
That's a burgeoning continent.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.912
Well, they are expanding
their economic base, yeah.

14:12.084 --> 14:13.381
Tell me about it.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.787
Excuse me, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.445
I'm hip.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.991
-Hip to what?
-To the whole scene.

14:23.929 --> 14:27.057
-What scene?
-The bathroom scene.

14:28.901 --> 14:31.495
Listen, don't take this personally,
but when I come back...

14:31.670 --> 14:34.901
...I'm sitting over there.
-Whatever turns you on.

14:40.112 --> 14:43.013
-No, no, I don't like it.
-What do you mean, you don't like it?

14:43.182 --> 14:46.174
-How could you not like it?
-I like the thick tape.

15:09.308 --> 15:12.471
Hey. What kind of nut are you?

15:15.381 --> 15:19.784
So basically, George,
the job here is quite simple.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.647
Selling bras.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.653
That interests me very much,
Mr. Farkus. Very much indeed, sir.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.814
Have you ever sold
a woman's line before?

15:26.992 --> 15:29.085
No, but...

15:29.261 --> 15:31.752
...I have a very good rapport
with women.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.762
Very good. Comfortable.

15:33.933 --> 15:38.131
And from the first time I laid eyes
on a brassiere...

15:38.304 --> 15:39.931
...I was enthralled.

15:42.241 --> 15:43.833
Tell me about it.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.901
Well, I was 14 years old...

15:47.079 --> 15:49.343
...I was in my friend's bathroom...

15:49.515 --> 15:53.417
...his mother's brassiere
was hanging over the shower rod.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.210
I picked it up.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.252
I studied it.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.215
I thought:

15:59.391 --> 16:00.619
"I like this."

16:00.793 --> 16:04.320
I didn't know in what way
or on what level, but I knew...

16:04.496 --> 16:06.987
...I wanted to be around brassieres.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.828
That's an incredible story.

16:10.602 --> 16:14.299
You have a remarkable passion
for brassieres.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.670
Well, they're more than just
underwear to me, Mr. Farkus.

16:18.177 --> 16:19.974
Two cups in the front...

16:20.145 --> 16:22.204
...two loops in the back...

16:22.481 --> 16:23.573
...how do they do it?

16:24.183 --> 16:26.014
Well, I think I can say...

16:26.185 --> 16:28.210
...barring some
unforeseen incident...

16:28.387 --> 16:31.686
...that you will have a very bright
future here at E.D. Granmont.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.051
Thank you, Mr. Farkus.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

16:35.227 --> 16:36.660
See you Monday, 9:00.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.025
If you don't mind, sir...

16:39.198 --> 16:40.859
...I'll be here at 8.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.724
Excellent.

16:43.035 --> 16:45.128
So long, Mr. Farkus.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.914
-What do you think you're doing?
-Nothing. What?

16:59.084 --> 17:00.574
Farkus, get out here.

17:01.086 --> 17:03.111
Oh, yes, Ms. De Granmont?

17:03.288 --> 17:04.550
Farkus...

17:04.723 --> 17:06.917
...who is this perverted little weasel?

17:07.092 --> 17:09.753
This is Costanza,
he's our new bra salesman.

17:09.928 --> 17:11.792
He's supposed to start on Monday.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.461
If he's here on Monday, you're not.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.294
Take your pick.

17:17.269 --> 17:20.727
Get out. I'm terribly sorry,
Ms. De Granmont.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.038
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Lippman?

17:24.209 --> 17:28.509
I was just going over
the Jake Jarmel book...

17:28.680 --> 17:31.774
...and I understand you worked
with him very closely on this.

17:31.950 --> 17:34.077
Yes... Yes, I did.

17:34.253 --> 17:37.245
And anyway, I was just reading
your final edit...

17:37.423 --> 17:43.055
...and there seems to be an inordinate
number of exclamation points.

17:43.462 --> 17:49.765
Well, I... I felt that the writing lacked
a certain emotion and intensity.

17:49.935 --> 17:51.266
You know, it's...

17:51.437 --> 17:56.739
"It was a damp and chilly afternoon,
so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"

17:57.342 --> 17:58.570
Right. Well...

17:58.744 --> 18:00.939
You put an exclamation point
after "sweatshirt."

18:01.113 --> 18:05.482
That's correct. I felt that the character
doesn't like to be chilly.

18:05.651 --> 18:06.879
I see.

18:07.052 --> 18:10.510
"I pulled the lever on the machine,
but the Clark bar didn't come out!"

18:11.356 --> 18:13.153
-Again, exclamation point.
-Yeah.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.316
Well, you know how frustrating
that can be...

18:15.494 --> 18:18.327
...when you keep putting quarters
and quarters into a machine...

18:18.497 --> 18:21.933
...and... nothing comes out.
-Get rid of the exclamation points.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.966
-Okay, I will.
-I hate exclamation points.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.660
Okay.

18:26.738 --> 18:28.706
Just... I'll...

18:30.075 --> 18:31.736
"Dear Barry, consider this letter...

18:31.910 --> 18:34.777
...the termination of our relationship,
effective immediately."

18:34.947 --> 18:36.812
-Exclamation point.
-Right.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.812
You still have no proof.

18:39.985 --> 18:42.112
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy
around me.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.949
"I will expect all funds in the form
of a cashier's check...

18:45.124 --> 18:46.614
...no later than the 18th."

18:46.792 --> 18:49.192
Double exclamation point.

18:49.995 --> 18:51.690
-Will that take care of ours too?
-Yep.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.196
I'll give you yours as soon as
I get my money back.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.061
Want me to mail it?
I'm on my way out.

18:56.235 --> 18:59.636
-Yeah, thanks.
-All right. Be my pleasure.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.709
See you later.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.377
You know, this is...

19:09.481 --> 19:11.574
-Hey, Ralph.
-What's up, fellas?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.650
-That'll be 14.30.
-All right.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.515
-Mushrooms? You got mushrooms.
-Yeah.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.289
-What's the matter, you got a cold?
-No, man.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.984
-Kramer, what is this?
-It's a sweater.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.926
-What is it made out of?
-I don't know. Jerry gave it to me.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.566
-It's mohair, I think.
-Mohair. That figures.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.361
I'm allergic to mohair.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.902
-You mean, you just started sniffing?
-Yeah.

19:33.071 --> 19:34.698
Mohair does it to me every time.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.443
I was wearing that sweater in the
coffee shop when Barry came in.

19:39.611 --> 19:43.570
-Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
-The sweater made him sniff.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.240
See? I told you he wasn't
a drug addict.

19:46.418 --> 19:47.646
Oh, no, the letter.

19:47.819 --> 19:51.118
Newman... It's got
exclamation points all over it.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.191
Not to mention the picture of him
on the toilet.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.694
The what?

20:10.275 --> 20:12.539
-After you.
-Thank you.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.543
Get your hands off of me!

20:16.848 --> 20:19.544
Johnny! Johnny!

20:24.990 --> 20:26.821
What do you mean,
you felt her material?

20:26.992 --> 20:28.550
What? With your fingers, like this?

20:28.727 --> 20:30.957
So what? What's so bad about that?

20:31.129 --> 20:33.791
Who goes around
feeling people's material?

20:33.966 --> 20:37.458
What can be gained
by feeling a person's material?

20:37.636 --> 20:38.967
It's insanity.

20:39.137 --> 20:41.901
Whatever happened to, "My,
that's a lovely dress you have on.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.336
May I have this dance?"

20:49.681 --> 20:53.117
You know, you are really lucky
Newman never mailed that letter.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.945
Sorry I'm late. I just came from
a meeting with my lawyer.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.680
-Hey.
-What is this?

20:58.857 --> 21:02.623
It's a letter from your friend
Barry Prophet's lawyer.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.587
He's filing Chapter 11?

21:05.764 --> 21:07.857
What's going on?
Why is he filing Chapter 11?

21:08.033 --> 21:09.364
Bankruptcy.

21:09.534 --> 21:12.526
Bankruptcy. As in, "I've taken
your money and spent it on drugs."

21:13.472 --> 21:15.303
What? I thought it was the sweater.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.499
-What about the money?
-What about the money?

21:17.676 --> 21:19.735
If I had dissolved my relationship
with him...

21:19.911 --> 21:22.937
...prior to his filing Chapter 11,
I could've got the money back.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.343
Which I would've done...

21:24.516 --> 21:28.509
...if a certain imbecile had been able
to get to a mailbox and mail a letter.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.327
Pair of bear claws, please.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.458
Nice.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.536
-Think so?
-Yeah, what is it?

21:46.905 --> 21:48.839
Half silk, half cotton, half linen.

21:51.076 --> 21:53.237
How can you go wrong?

22:01.553 --> 22:04.044
My accountant actually did...

22:04.222 --> 22:07.487
...take a big chunk of money from me
and use it to buy drugs.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.389
The thing that was hardest for me
to comprehend about this...

22:10.562 --> 22:15.056
...is the life choice of drug abuse
and accounting.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.863
It makes sense. Why would
an athlete or musician take drugs?

22:19.037 --> 22:20.402
They have an interesting job.

22:20.572 --> 22:24.201
But an accountant? If ever a job
required hallucinogenic support...

22:24.376 --> 22:26.105
...this is the job.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.576
That should be the legal defense.

22:28.747 --> 22:31.443
"You're charged with
possession of illegal narcotics."

22:31.616 --> 22:34.551
"But, Your Honor,
I'm an accountant."

22:35.287 --> 22:36.515
Bang. "Case closed.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.180
Bailiff, give this man his peyote
and tequila back for the drive home.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.793
Sorry to bother you, sir.
Terribly sorry."
