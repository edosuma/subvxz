WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.668
<i>Previously on Royal Pain...</i>

00:01.675 --> 00:03.292
Well, if you don't like our new rates,

00:03.292 --> 00:05.618
then of course you're free
to use another facility.

00:05.618 --> 00:07.958
You have the only imaging
and lab facilities in the area.

00:08.376 --> 00:08.799
Yeah.

00:09.457 --> 00:11.165
This could be the last summer of Hankmed.

00:11.165 --> 00:13.646
- You poached my nanny?
- Typical new mom mistake.

00:14.059 --> 00:16.222
Never introduce a great nanny
to a desperate mother.

00:16.515 --> 00:20.225
So now tomorrow, I'll have to
spend all day interviewing nannies,

00:20.357 --> 00:23.796
the ironic part being that while I'll
have 12 nannies in your kitchen,

00:23.956 --> 00:25.823
I'll have no one to watch over Sashi.

00:25.857 --> 00:26.958
Hey, what's the score?

00:26.992 --> 00:29.527
Gotta get a picture of Ricky.

00:29.561 --> 00:32.063
You're probably not gonna
get much for that photo.

00:32.097 --> 00:33.698
Oh, I was just gonna put it on Instagram

00:33.732 --> 00:35.166
for my friends back home.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.234
I thought you were gonna try
and sell it to Snarkhampton.

00:37.269 --> 00:40.938
How did Snarkhampton get it?

00:40.973 --> 00:43.441
I guess someone sold it to them.

00:43.475 --> 00:45.543
Paige found us a new
patient, Ray Mazzarino.

00:45.577 --> 00:46.711
The mob guy?

00:46.745 --> 00:51.749
I need rugs, tables,
pictures, the works.

00:51.783 --> 00:52.883
And I want the best.

00:52.918 --> 00:53.918
What's this?

00:53.952 --> 00:56.153
A down payment on a Hankmed retainer.

00:56.188 --> 00:57.421
Uh...

00:57.456 --> 00:59.790
You take cash, right?

00:59.825 --> 01:02.827
I wish we could start our own hospital.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:20.979 --> 01:24.015
Anyway, section 4, it
states that reimbursement

01:24.049 --> 01:26.317
to Berger & Lawson for any items purchased

01:26.351 --> 01:28.586
for your house is to be
paid within three days.

01:28.620 --> 01:32.289
That is, if three days sounds reasonable.

01:32.324 --> 01:34.625
I'm also sorry things got so
far without us ever meeting

01:34.659 --> 01:35.626
to discuss the terms, you know?

01:35.660 --> 01:37.428
Here you go, Uncle Ray.

01:37.462 --> 01:38.963
That's not how we do business normally.

01:38.997 --> 01:40.998
I find that...

01:41.033 --> 01:44.101
Anyway, section 4A discusses nonpayment...

01:44.136 --> 01:45.636
Move that inside.

01:45.670 --> 01:49.740
An event, of course, which I
doubt I'll ever to live to see,

01:49.775 --> 01:52.543
which is not to say that I think
anything's gonna happen to me.

01:52.577 --> 01:54.545
You know, that was kind of
just a figure of speech...

01:54.579 --> 01:55.980
You don't like what
my designer picked out?

01:56.014 --> 01:58.516
No, I-I love the Italian accents.

01:58.550 --> 02:02.520
It's just, you've created such a
strong Novecento motif in there,

02:02.554 --> 02:04.955
it makes the baroque
pieces feel a little heavy.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.757
Bottom line, loves the Italian.

02:06.792 --> 02:09.092
So moving right along to section 4B...

02:09.127 --> 02:10.394
Can you find me something
to replace it with that works

02:10.429 --> 02:11.896
by tomorrow night?

02:11.930 --> 02:13.631
There's an estate auction
in Sagaponack in the morning.

02:13.665 --> 02:15.766
Which would require a
completely separate contract.

02:15.801 --> 02:19.203
My wife Olivia is coming to opening night.

02:19.237 --> 02:20.805
This is a big step
towards winning her back.

02:20.839 --> 02:23.207
Table for two, favorite Barolo.

02:23.241 --> 02:25.076
I need everything to be perfect.

02:25.110 --> 02:26.377
How fast can you show me something?

02:26.411 --> 02:27.845
I have the book in my car.

02:27.879 --> 02:29.613
Yeah, which we should look
at after we finalize the terms.

02:29.648 --> 02:30.648
- Hi, Paige.
- Hi, Hank.

02:30.682 --> 02:32.416
- Bye, Paige.
- Bye, Hank.

02:32.451 --> 02:34.285
Ray, I just got your text. What's going on?

02:34.319 --> 02:36.487
My cabinet's baroque.

02:36.521 --> 02:38.823
- Don't say it, Henry, don't...
- Then fix it.

02:38.857 --> 02:42.660
- I... because it's broke,
- You could fix it.

02:42.694 --> 02:43.894
I'm sorry about him.

02:43.929 --> 02:46.263
Wait, Evan, how do you know my doctor?

02:46.298 --> 02:47.431
Passaic.

02:47.466 --> 02:48.599
30-something years ago,

02:48.633 --> 02:49.934
my parents brought him
home from the hospital,

02:49.968 --> 02:51.302
and I still can't get rid of him.

02:51.336 --> 02:54.305
Doesn't help that he's
the C.F.O of Hankmed.

02:54.339 --> 02:55.840
You're the guy, huh?

02:55.874 --> 02:57.007
I wouldn't go that far.

02:57.042 --> 02:58.709
Art Baron, medical exec.

02:58.743 --> 02:59.977
You came out here to the Hamptons,

03:00.011 --> 03:01.212
got everything completely wired.

03:01.246 --> 03:02.379
Well, kind of.

03:02.414 --> 03:04.081
And you keep your business in the family.

03:04.116 --> 03:05.316
I respect that.

03:05.350 --> 03:07.651
Okay. What about you, Ray?

03:07.686 --> 03:09.687
How's your energy level been
since you left the hospital?

03:09.721 --> 03:11.555
Oh, I'm fine. I called about my chef.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.190
Oh.

03:13.225 --> 03:15.326
Um...

03:15.360 --> 03:19.196
Hey, Passaic, draw up
whatever terms you need.

03:19.231 --> 03:21.632
I'll check them over later.

03:21.666 --> 03:24.602
I trust you.

03:24.636 --> 03:26.570
[Chuckles]

03:26.605 --> 03:28.506
Take a break, Franklin.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.274
Let Dr. Lawson check you out.

03:30.308 --> 03:32.176
Oh, yeah, sure, I can
take a break, no problem.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.644
Or I got an idea.

03:33.678 --> 03:37.414
Why don't you come over here
and urinate in my consomme?

03:37.449 --> 03:39.049
Your consomme's gonna be fine.

03:39.084 --> 03:40.751
Fine. Oh, good... okay, good.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.186
We're striving for fine around here now.

03:42.220 --> 03:44.088
Was Beethoven's ninth just fine?

03:44.122 --> 03:46.123
I don't think so. I
think it was perfection.

03:46.158 --> 03:48.392
But then again, why would
I expect a restaurant owner

03:48.426 --> 03:50.461
to get that a hundred
different ingredients,

03:50.495 --> 03:52.630
like musical notes, can
blend together to form

03:52.664 --> 03:54.732
something greater, something transcendent?

03:54.766 --> 03:56.200
You're transcending my patience,

03:56.234 --> 03:58.135
not to mention wasting
time working with one arm.

03:58.170 --> 03:59.136
Now, move it.

03:59.171 --> 04:00.704
Whatever. All right.

04:00.739 --> 04:01.872
Hector, come here.

04:01.907 --> 04:03.908
Stay on my consomme, all right?

04:03.942 --> 04:05.276
- Hi, I'm Hank.
- Hey, Hank.

04:05.310 --> 04:06.744
- Let me take a look.
- All right.

04:06.778 --> 04:07.845
- Yeah, it's a little tender.
- Okay.

04:07.879 --> 04:08.846
[Inhales sharply]

04:08.880 --> 04:10.648
- Ow.
- Wow, what happened here?

04:10.682 --> 04:12.383
Injured in the line of duty.

04:12.417 --> 04:13.584
Mandolin fight.

04:13.618 --> 04:14.985
I've had worse.

04:15.020 --> 04:18.022
I got the scars and the cabinet
full of antibiotics to prove it.

04:18.055 --> 04:20.558
- It's not clotting on its own.
- No.

04:20.591 --> 04:21.559
Do you have any cornstarch here?

04:21.593 --> 04:23.093
Yeah, right over there.

04:23.128 --> 04:24.495
Okay, just hold that for me.

04:24.529 --> 04:25.496
What are you gonna do?

04:25.530 --> 04:27.498
You gonna cure me with gravy?

04:27.532 --> 04:29.633
Sort of, actually.

04:29.668 --> 04:30.935
Cornstarch is a natural clotting agent.

04:30.969 --> 04:31.936
Oh.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.003
- Give me your arm.
- Yeah.

04:33.038 --> 04:34.939
- Didn't know that.
- Yep.

04:34.973 --> 04:36.507
So this mandolin fight,

04:36.541 --> 04:38.943
was it more boxing match or drunken brawl?

04:38.977 --> 04:40.578
Oh, very good, very
good, Ray. That's clever.

04:40.612 --> 04:42.213
That's his super subtle way of asking

04:42.247 --> 04:43.414
if I was loaded when I did this.

04:43.448 --> 04:45.149
Oh, really? Why would he think you were?

04:45.183 --> 04:47.818
Not so long ago in a far
off land called Manhattan,

04:47.852 --> 04:50.888
there was a young, hot
chef, had lines out the door.

04:50.922 --> 04:52.523
He had a book deal on the hook.

04:52.557 --> 04:54.625
Also liked to drink a little too much.

04:54.659 --> 04:57.828
Anyway, long story short,
downward spiral this,

04:57.862 --> 05:01.298
irreversible professional
damage that, here I am.

05:01.333 --> 05:04.802
Changed man, a little clumsy
but totally bone sober.

05:04.836 --> 05:06.503
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

05:06.538 --> 05:08.639
Well, would you look at that?

05:08.673 --> 05:11.308
Holy cow, I got a whole
new respect for cornstarch.

05:11.343 --> 05:13.177
I like this guy, Ray.

05:13.211 --> 05:15.045
What the hell's he doing
hanging out with you?

05:15.080 --> 05:17.081
Hoping you'll stop talking
and get back to your soup.

05:17.115 --> 05:19.950
It's not soup, Ray. It's consomme.

05:19.985 --> 05:22.319
I think you heard me.

05:22.354 --> 05:24.888
I never met an owner who
knows a gratin from a glaze.

05:24.923 --> 05:27.424
But, you know, Ray's a good guy.

05:27.459 --> 05:28.626
He was the only one who was willing

05:28.660 --> 05:30.461
to give me a second chance, so...

05:30.495 --> 05:32.062
I just gotta stay clean.

05:32.097 --> 05:33.831
Sounds like a good plan.

05:35.834 --> 05:38.335
[Humming]

05:43.408 --> 05:45.743
- Hi, Nate.
- Hi.

05:45.777 --> 05:48.078
[Whispering] She's ready to fall asleep.

05:48.113 --> 05:50.481
We had a really big day.

05:50.515 --> 05:52.516
We had tummy time, song time,

05:52.550 --> 05:54.752
wound down with a little baby massage.

05:54.786 --> 05:56.720
And I'd keep your phone
on these next few days,

05:56.755 --> 05:58.422
'cause I got a feeling this little girl's

05:58.456 --> 05:59.757
gonna start crawling any minute.

05:59.791 --> 06:01.725
Well, I will certainly try.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.661
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

06:03.695 --> 06:06.597
Oh, Ms. Katdare, before
I started last week,

06:06.631 --> 06:09.733
I put my name in for a
childhood development class.

06:09.768 --> 06:11.402
It meets two nights a week.

06:11.436 --> 06:14.605
Today I found out I got a spot.

06:16.274 --> 06:19.209
Um, really enjoy this job.

06:19.244 --> 06:22.146
And I don't want to
jeopardize it, like, at all.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.915
So if that doesn't work for
you, I totally understand.

06:24.949 --> 06:29.019
I'm usually home most
nights by 7:00 anyway,

06:29.054 --> 06:31.522
so I thought I'd ask.

06:31.556 --> 06:34.491
I'll think about it.

06:34.526 --> 06:36.527
Um, yeah.

06:39.264 --> 06:42.566
[Sighs]

06:42.600 --> 06:44.401
Hi, Sashi.

06:44.436 --> 06:46.603
Mommy missed you all day long.

06:57.482 --> 06:58.849
Um...

06:58.883 --> 07:01.985
Hey, ready to go check out
the future site of Hanklab?

07:02.020 --> 07:02.986
I think this one's gonna be it.

07:03.021 --> 07:04.254
I don't think it is.

07:04.289 --> 07:06.190
Oh, I can feel it in my bones, Jeremiah,

07:06.224 --> 07:07.558
bones we'll soon be able to image

07:07.592 --> 07:08.992
in the diagnostic wing of Hanklab.

07:09.027 --> 07:10.194
I'm so excited.

07:10.228 --> 07:11.462
No, I just spoke to
the real estate agent.

07:11.496 --> 07:15.766
Apparently the square
footage is insufficient.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.167
Okay.

07:17.202 --> 07:18.602
That's fine. You know what? That's great.

07:18.636 --> 07:20.904
Let's just go check out
that other place then,

07:20.939 --> 07:22.306
that place in Montauk.

07:22.340 --> 07:23.640
Unfortunately, that's
even more expensive

07:23.675 --> 07:26.744
than the place we saw yesterday.

07:26.778 --> 07:28.746
Which places aren't too
expensive or too small?

07:28.780 --> 07:30.681
Like, what are... what the heck?

07:30.715 --> 07:32.015
We're on long island, for God's sakes.

07:32.050 --> 07:33.917
It's a... it's a long island.

07:33.952 --> 07:35.319
There's got to be something.

07:35.353 --> 07:37.287
Hanklab was supposed to be
the solution to our problems,

07:37.322 --> 07:38.789
get us out from under the thumb

07:38.823 --> 07:40.124
of stupid symphony and
their stupid new rates.

07:40.158 --> 07:41.959
Now it's just turning
into a freaking disaster.

07:41.993 --> 07:43.761
Disaster?

07:43.795 --> 07:45.929
What's a disaster?

07:45.964 --> 07:48.699
- Just some high
- Class problems really.

07:48.733 --> 07:50.267
Hankmed's looking to grow,

07:50.301 --> 07:51.969
and we're having trouble finding
the right space, that's all.

07:52.003 --> 07:53.837
Well, I've grown a business or two

07:53.872 --> 07:55.239
against some long odds.

07:55.273 --> 07:56.306
Maybe I can help.

07:56.341 --> 07:59.843
Come find me inside. We'll talk.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.881
What do you think?

08:03.915 --> 08:05.849
I mean, decorating his house is one thing.

08:05.884 --> 08:08.519
But should we really be,

08:08.553 --> 08:10.154
you know, going inside with this guy?

08:10.188 --> 08:12.322
We should at least
hear what he has to say.

08:12.357 --> 08:13.757
If we can't find a place,

08:13.792 --> 08:15.859
we may need to devise a
new strategy for Hankmed.

08:15.894 --> 08:18.406
If we can't find a place,
there won't be any Hankmed.

08:28.387 --> 08:29.250
Hey.

08:29.730 --> 08:30.730
What you doing?

08:30.764 --> 08:34.000
- Uh, just girl stuff.
- Ah.

08:34.034 --> 08:35.835
I mean, not that I
can afford any of this,

08:35.869 --> 08:41.039
- but dare to dream, right?
- Yeah.

08:44.544 --> 08:47.780
Thank you so much for the
clothes you sent, Lorena.

08:47.814 --> 08:49.315
Do you think Sashi will wear them?

08:49.349 --> 08:50.783
[Chuckles]

08:50.817 --> 08:52.952
I'm sure that when she's
old enough to play soccer,

08:52.986 --> 08:55.421
she'll never take that tiny uniform off.

08:55.455 --> 08:56.422
Don't forget.

08:56.456 --> 08:59.058
My granddaughter is half Argentinean.

08:59.092 --> 09:01.761
She must wear the white and the blue.

09:01.795 --> 09:04.563
You send more pictures, and
I'll send you more clothes.

09:04.598 --> 09:07.667
Oh, you drive a hard bargain,
Lorena, but you know what?

09:07.701 --> 09:08.834
You got a deal.

09:08.869 --> 09:12.505
- Adios.
- Adios.

09:12.539 --> 09:14.907
Seems like you and
Lorena are getting close.

09:14.941 --> 09:16.742
She's been wonderful to Sashi.

09:16.777 --> 09:20.279
And it's been nice for me too as a mother.

09:20.313 --> 09:23.149
Everything I want now I want as a mother.

09:23.183 --> 09:26.252
And what I want for Sashi is
for her to feel the presence

09:26.286 --> 09:28.988
and the tradition of her
family, her whole family.

09:29.022 --> 09:30.456
Yeah, of course you do.

09:30.490 --> 09:32.258
[Sighs] I mean, really,

09:32.292 --> 09:34.860
who... who would have thought
that I, of all people,

09:34.895 --> 09:37.196
would be craving family tradition?

09:37.230 --> 09:40.900
Actually, I would have thought that.

09:40.934 --> 09:42.568
The Divya I first met three years ago

09:42.602 --> 09:44.336
was running away from expectations,

09:44.371 --> 09:45.905
trying to find herself.

09:45.939 --> 09:48.107
And there's no question you've done that.

09:48.141 --> 09:51.177
I mean, you're confident, successful,

09:51.211 --> 09:53.045
the most independent woman I know.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.481
So now you have room in
your life for tradition

09:55.515 --> 09:57.616
without feeling suffocated by it.

09:57.651 --> 09:59.118
Makes all the sense in the world,

09:59.152 --> 10:01.620
especially for a mother.

10:01.655 --> 10:04.657
A wonderful mother.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.460
Thank you, Hank.

10:07.494 --> 10:09.495
I don't know what I'd do
without you and your wisdom.

10:09.529 --> 10:11.230
Well, yeah, that's
the other amazing thing

10:11.264 --> 10:12.431
that's happened in your life.

10:12.466 --> 10:15.201
[Laughs] What would be really amazing

10:15.235 --> 10:18.304
would be if I could find an amazing nanny.

10:18.338 --> 10:20.039
I'm gonna have to take another day off

10:20.073 --> 10:21.640
to do another round of interviews.

10:21.675 --> 10:23.642
I thought you liked number five.

10:23.677 --> 10:25.144
He was a better cook than one and four,

10:25.178 --> 10:26.345
though not quite as neat as three,

10:26.379 --> 10:27.947
or is two the neat one?

10:27.981 --> 10:29.882
He's the one who's already
got one foot out of the door.

10:29.916 --> 10:33.352
You know, and things are hard
enough, but I absolutely refuse

10:33.386 --> 10:35.221
to be burned again by one of these nannies.

10:35.255 --> 10:36.622
Hey, hey, hey.

10:36.656 --> 10:37.742
Are you okay?

10:40.093 --> 10:42.993
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine. I'm sorry.

10:43.196 --> 10:44.797
I think I'm frustrated.

10:44.831 --> 10:46.699
Look, this is the
person you're counting on

10:46.733 --> 10:48.634
for the care of your child.

10:48.668 --> 10:50.169
Of course it's not an easy decision.

10:50.203 --> 10:52.838
You just take all the time you need.

11:17.898 --> 11:21.500
- Are you Divya?
- Yes. I am so sorry.

11:21.535 --> 11:23.836
This is the fifth garage stall
I've tried before finding you.

11:23.870 --> 11:25.104
How's your father?

11:25.138 --> 11:27.306
Like every crew chief
preparing for a time trial,

11:27.340 --> 11:30.309
except mine has a history of
cardiac arrest and a pacemaker.

11:30.343 --> 11:32.211
And you're worried because...

11:32.245 --> 11:34.847
He's usually working on the
engine, carrying the tires.

11:34.881 --> 11:37.249
Every time he tries to use
his left hand, he can't,

11:37.284 --> 11:38.717
and I know that left arm weakness

11:38.752 --> 11:40.853
can have something to do with your heart.

11:40.887 --> 11:42.888
Don't be mad, but I called a doctor.

11:42.923 --> 11:44.190
Come on, Ash.

11:44.224 --> 11:46.158
Carl Edwards' guys
could be here any minute.

11:46.193 --> 11:48.294
So could Carl Edwards.

11:48.328 --> 11:49.295
How's it going?

11:49.329 --> 11:50.462
You must be Ashley.

11:50.497 --> 11:51.831
- I-I-I am.
- Nice to meet you.

11:51.865 --> 11:53.465
This is my father, Dave.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

11:54.534 --> 11:55.801
Don't be so mad at her, Dave.

11:55.836 --> 11:57.002
It seems like she's
just looking out for you.

11:57.037 --> 11:58.571
See? See?

11:58.605 --> 11:59.872
But how do you know who I am?

11:59.906 --> 12:02.074
I keep my eye on the
next generation of racers.

12:02.108 --> 12:04.376
We're always looking
for top talent to mentor.

12:04.411 --> 12:06.378
Plus your name is right
here on your race car.

12:06.413 --> 12:09.114
[Laughs] You'd think I
would have figured that out.

12:09.149 --> 12:11.083
I mean, it's really a newbie mistake.

12:11.117 --> 12:13.219
My first six sprint cup series races,

12:13.253 --> 12:14.720
I actually drove the wrong car.

12:14.754 --> 12:15.921
Oh, really?

12:15.956 --> 12:18.524
No. [Chuckles] No.

12:18.558 --> 12:20.159
You should... you should
listen to your dad.

12:20.193 --> 12:21.994
Your friend here seems
a little bit gullible.

12:22.028 --> 12:23.929
Plus, I'd really like to see you win.

12:23.964 --> 12:25.264
So good luck.

12:25.298 --> 12:27.166
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you, Carl.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.500
See that, baby?

12:28.535 --> 12:31.270
Carl Edwards is pulling
for you. This is it.

12:31.304 --> 12:34.039
Since the only thing around
here that needs tuning up

12:34.074 --> 12:35.341
is her engine,

12:35.375 --> 12:37.409
can we get on with this, please?

12:43.950 --> 12:44.917
Hi.

12:44.951 --> 12:46.151
Gentlemen, welcome to

12:46.186 --> 12:48.287
one of my latest real estate acquisitions

12:48.321 --> 12:50.089
and the future of Hankmed.

12:55.095 --> 12:58.397
It'll be fully wired for
electric at 110 and 220,

12:58.431 --> 13:01.000
zoned A/C with optional counterflow units

13:01.034 --> 13:02.801
and upgradeable modular plumbing.

13:02.836 --> 13:05.104
The landlord will even install
whatever flooring you choose.

13:05.138 --> 13:10.809
I hear he's a great guy and very handsome.

13:10.844 --> 13:14.146
Wow.

13:14.180 --> 13:16.548
This is big.

13:16.583 --> 13:19.985
There might even be room
for a Fluoroscopy suite.

13:20.020 --> 13:22.788
No, I mean, like big.

13:22.822 --> 13:25.758
If we can go beyond our
own needs, think about it.

13:25.792 --> 13:28.327
If we can offer affordable
prices to other practices,

13:28.361 --> 13:30.429
Jeremiah, this could be a
huge opportunity for growth.

13:30.463 --> 13:32.531
I love the way you think, kid.

13:32.565 --> 13:33.866
Always looking for the upside

13:33.900 --> 13:36.302
but never losing the personal touch.

13:36.336 --> 13:38.404
Clearly Hankmed is not
just a business to you.

13:38.438 --> 13:40.039
It's a way of life.

13:40.073 --> 13:41.674
Ray.

13:41.708 --> 13:45.344
I could totally hug you right now, um,

13:45.378 --> 13:47.947
but I'm pretty sure the rental
price is gonna actually kill me,

13:47.981 --> 13:49.481
so just tell me what it is really fast.

13:49.516 --> 13:50.683
Oh, Passaic,

13:50.717 --> 13:52.751
a good relationship
should not have to hurt,

13:52.786 --> 13:54.520
unless you're into that sort of thing.

13:54.554 --> 13:57.122
[Chuckles] Right?

13:57.157 --> 13:58.991
I think the health care industry's

13:59.025 --> 14:00.092
poised for massive growth,

14:00.126 --> 14:01.694
and I'd like to learn the economics.

14:01.728 --> 14:03.195
So why not cut you a break on rent?

14:03.229 --> 14:06.432
To me, it'll be an investment
in knowledge capital.

14:06.466 --> 14:07.666
Ray...

14:07.701 --> 14:09.768
- I am ready for that hug now.
- Let's not.

14:09.803 --> 14:11.403
- [Muffled music playing]
- What is that sound?

14:11.438 --> 14:12.805
- It's just the place next door.
- [Phone chirping]

14:12.839 --> 14:14.227
Oh, yeah? What place is that?

14:16.509 --> 14:18.356
Yeah.

14:23.083 --> 14:26.118
Okay.

14:26.152 --> 14:28.253
This is... this is okay.

14:28.288 --> 14:30.222
Hankmed can't open its diagnostic center

14:30.256 --> 14:32.324
next to a place where women
take off their clothes.

14:32.359 --> 14:35.861
Well, I'm not a doctor,
but technically our patients

14:35.895 --> 14:38.530
will also be taking off their clothes.

14:38.565 --> 14:40.399
Look, I've done my research, okay.

14:40.433 --> 14:42.234
Ray's a major player in construction,

14:42.268 --> 14:44.303
import/export, and urban services.

14:44.337 --> 14:45.504
The guy's smart, Jeremiah.

14:45.538 --> 14:46.572
He knows what he's doing.

14:46.606 --> 14:48.674
And he thinks we can put a lab here.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.077
Besides, we need this.

14:52.112 --> 14:53.479
We're talking the future of Hankmed.

14:53.513 --> 14:56.148
Yes, we are, and that
future shouldn't share a wall

14:56.182 --> 14:57.983
with women in their underwear.

14:58.018 --> 15:01.186
Well, I don't know what to say.

15:01.221 --> 15:03.756
You're the medical director. I'm the C.F.O.

15:03.790 --> 15:06.959
What do you propose we do?

15:06.993 --> 15:09.795
We should take this to Hank.

15:09.829 --> 15:11.063
Yeah.

15:24.826 --> 15:27.127
Hey, Ray, what seems to be the...

15:27.162 --> 15:28.128
What did you do to your hand?

15:28.163 --> 15:30.197
Oh, I'm not the patient.

15:30.231 --> 15:31.598
Look at him.

15:31.633 --> 15:33.500
Drunk as a skunk on opening day.

15:33.535 --> 15:35.702
You know, I cooked skunk one time.

15:35.737 --> 15:36.803
Tasted like chicken.

15:36.838 --> 15:40.007
Like smelly, smelly chicken.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.575
Ow, ow, ow!

15:41.609 --> 15:43.277
Okay, okay. You broke his nose.

15:43.311 --> 15:44.311
Well, I warned him.

15:44.345 --> 15:45.479
Tonight's about Olivia.

15:45.513 --> 15:47.781
Ray, I need you to leave.

15:47.815 --> 15:48.882
Are you seriously trying
to tell me what to do

15:48.917 --> 15:50.117
in my own restaurant?

15:50.151 --> 15:52.019
I am a doctor treating a patient injured

15:52.053 --> 15:55.522
in your restaurant by you,
so yeah, seriously, go.

15:55.557 --> 16:01.328
Take a hike, Ray.

16:01.362 --> 16:02.829
Is it broken, really?

16:02.864 --> 16:07.000
- It's really broken, my friend.
- Ah, for crying out loud.

16:07.035 --> 16:09.536
On a scale of one to ten,
how severe is your weakness?

16:09.571 --> 16:11.238
Honestly, I haven't
even thought about it.

16:11.272 --> 16:13.640
This time trial's too
important for things like that.

16:13.675 --> 16:15.475
Today's all about Ashley.

16:15.510 --> 16:16.977
Hold your arms up like this, please,

16:17.011 --> 16:20.681
and push up against my hands.

16:20.715 --> 16:22.783
Thank you.

16:22.817 --> 16:24.818
Excuse my ignorance, but a time trial

16:24.852 --> 16:26.153
doesn't even sound like a race.

16:26.187 --> 16:27.521
Well, races come and go.

16:27.555 --> 16:29.756
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

16:29.791 --> 16:32.226
Carl Edwards' team is
looking for a new driver,

16:32.260 --> 16:34.328
so they brought together
all these top amateurs.

16:34.362 --> 16:36.330
Whoever clocks the fastest four laps

16:36.364 --> 16:37.965
is gonna get their shot at the big time.

16:37.999 --> 16:41.501
Well, I'm happy to report
your EKG is completely normal,

16:41.536 --> 16:44.171
but your left arm is
weaker than your right arm,

16:44.205 --> 16:46.907
which is most likely
Musculoskeletal in nature,

16:46.941 --> 16:50.444
anything from a strained
ligament to an irritated nerve

16:50.478 --> 16:51.511
to a muscle tear.

16:51.546 --> 16:53.347
But to be safe, I'll keep an eye on you

16:53.381 --> 16:54.982
until the time trial is over.

16:55.016 --> 16:56.250
Great.

16:56.284 --> 16:58.385
In the meantime, can I get
back to fine-tuning machines

16:58.419 --> 16:59.553
instead of being hooked up to one?

16:59.587 --> 17:01.622
Yes.

17:01.656 --> 17:04.023
In a second.

17:04.058 --> 17:05.626
I barely had anything to drink.

17:05.660 --> 17:07.894
I didn't... a couple sips of
wine with a pairing menu.

17:07.929 --> 17:08.895
That's it.

17:08.930 --> 17:10.797
Okay. Just look straight ahead for me.

17:10.832 --> 17:12.933
Drunken behavior can sometimes be a sign

17:12.967 --> 17:14.534
of neurological impairment.

17:14.569 --> 17:16.136
That's why I want to make sure
we're not missing anything.

17:16.170 --> 17:18.038
- Uh-huh.
- Stand up for me.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.039
I want you to walk a straight line

17:19.073 --> 17:20.473
just like I am right now, okay?

17:20.508 --> 17:21.742
Putting one foot in front of the other.

17:21.776 --> 17:22.976
All right.

17:23.011 --> 17:26.146
Yeah, I must have been
impaired to work with a guy

17:26.180 --> 17:28.315
whose idea of high culture
is putting the yogurt

17:28.348 --> 17:29.583
on top of the fruit.

17:29.617 --> 17:30.851
Oh, good.

17:30.885 --> 17:32.452
Good, so get yourself cleaned
up and get off my terrace.

17:32.487 --> 17:34.054
Don't worry about it, Ray.
I'm gonna leave, all right?

17:34.088 --> 17:36.189
Just as soon as this guy tapes
my nose back onto my face.

17:36.224 --> 17:37.391
Okay, Franklin, have a seat.

17:37.425 --> 17:38.825
No, no, you're going back in the kitchen.

17:38.860 --> 17:40.193
I don't have time to find
another chef before tonight,

17:40.228 --> 17:41.395
let alone a sober one.

17:41.429 --> 17:42.963
I'm telling you, man, I had, like, two...

17:42.997 --> 17:45.499
I had, like, maybe three
sips of wine maximum.

17:45.533 --> 17:46.700
Tell him, Hank.

17:46.734 --> 17:48.135
- Okay, you are a little off
- Balance,

17:48.169 --> 17:49.569
but otherwise neurologically intact,

17:49.604 --> 17:51.138
so before we do any further workup,

17:51.172 --> 17:52.572
I'm gonna order a blood alcohol test.

17:52.607 --> 17:55.842
Sounds good to me.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.083
I just... I don't understand.

18:03.117 --> 18:04.885
You're concerned about
a 17-year-old girl

18:04.919 --> 18:06.453
because she was not
shopping on the Internet?

18:06.487 --> 18:08.355
The more I get to know
Emma, the more I sense

18:08.389 --> 18:11.683
that she wants something...
Something bigger.

18:12.211 --> 18:14.261
When she helped me with
that patient at the barbecue

18:14.295 --> 18:16.963
and didn't bat an eye at all that blood,

18:16.998 --> 18:19.366
it just... it really felt like
she was my sister, you know?

18:19.400 --> 18:22.102
And as her brother, I want to
be there to expose her to things,

18:22.136 --> 18:24.204
help her get everything
she wants out of life.

18:24.238 --> 18:25.539
Like you exposed me to accounting

18:25.573 --> 18:26.873
when you didn't like
where life was taking me?

18:26.908 --> 18:28.375
You wanted to be a movie star.

18:28.409 --> 18:30.143
Life was not taking you there.

18:30.178 --> 18:32.412
Then why did the
Passaic high courier say

18:32.447 --> 18:34.314
my turn in pippin,
"breathed new vitality"...

18:34.349 --> 18:35.349
Because you wrote that review.

18:35.383 --> 18:36.683
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:36.718 --> 18:37.951
I want to talk to her.

18:37.985 --> 18:40.220
You know, I actually... I
picked up some brochures

18:40.254 --> 18:41.521
from a few local colleges.

18:41.556 --> 18:43.290
- Which ones?
- Hello, gentlemen.

18:43.324 --> 18:44.291
Hello.

18:44.325 --> 18:45.692
Have you dined with us before?

18:45.727 --> 18:48.562
No, we have not. Any recommendations?

18:48.596 --> 18:51.031
Remember the alamo.
Speak truth to power.

18:51.065 --> 18:52.232
Be the change that you wish to see.

18:52.266 --> 18:53.834
Nice.

18:53.868 --> 18:54.901
You've been waiting all day
to use that one, haven't you?

18:54.936 --> 18:55.902
Yes.

18:55.937 --> 18:57.371
Also the Halibut's really good.

18:57.405 --> 18:58.505
Here, I'll get you guys some menus.

18:58.539 --> 19:00.540
Waitress.

19:03.177 --> 19:07.047
It's a thank-you from Oz.

19:07.081 --> 19:10.250
Uh, the Oz that runs Snarkhampton?

19:10.284 --> 19:12.819
Thanks, but I only gave him one photo.

19:12.854 --> 19:17.491
Oh, no, no, this is for
the next one, and so is this.

19:17.525 --> 19:19.826
Oz thinks that you might be of some value.

19:19.861 --> 19:21.161
You work at the right place,

19:21.195 --> 19:23.263
and that picture of you from this morning,

19:23.297 --> 19:26.299
that'll get you into all
the other right places.

19:28.436 --> 19:30.904
[Phone rings]

19:39.814 --> 19:40.847
That guy just gave her 100 bucks.

19:40.882 --> 19:41.948
Yeah.

19:41.983 --> 19:43.450
Yeah, she's slumming here, Henry.

19:43.484 --> 19:44.718
You definitely better
go expose her to more.

19:44.752 --> 19:46.219
That's not my point.

19:46.254 --> 19:49.389
Speaking of exposure, Ray's lab space?

19:49.424 --> 19:50.690
Great, like, amazing.

19:50.725 --> 19:52.626
There's just one little
adjacent business issue...

19:52.660 --> 19:55.028
See, Emma is a bright,
confident young woman.

19:55.062 --> 19:56.463
I just... I want her to
know there's more to life

19:56.497 --> 19:59.099
than some job where people think
they can slap down some cash

19:59.133 --> 20:01.034
and get whatever they want.

20:01.068 --> 20:03.770
Oh, my God, exactly.

20:03.805 --> 20:05.038
Sorry, sorry.

20:05.072 --> 20:07.507
You were saying something
about Ray's space?

20:07.542 --> 20:10.644
Hmm? No, no,
that's... that can wait.

20:18.453 --> 20:20.520
Hey, there.

20:20.555 --> 20:22.823
You're not working.

20:22.857 --> 20:24.758
I am, just inside my head.

20:24.792 --> 20:26.860
Oh.

20:26.894 --> 20:29.129
And you barely touched your water.

20:29.163 --> 20:31.131
Is something wrong?

20:40.875 --> 20:44.211
To save my business, we
have to find a new location

20:44.245 --> 20:46.012
where we can offer expanded services,

20:46.047 --> 20:50.684
but the only place we can
afford is directly adjacent

20:50.718 --> 20:55.021
to an... an adult establishment,

20:55.056 --> 20:58.492
um, which for a medical practice

20:58.526 --> 21:02.128
is obviously not ideal.

21:02.163 --> 21:03.263
So what?

21:03.297 --> 21:06.166
Are you the manager of this practice?

21:06.200 --> 21:08.835
No, I'm actually the medical director.

21:08.870 --> 21:12.038
You're a doctor.

21:12.073 --> 21:14.341
Hmm.

21:14.375 --> 21:19.312
So tell me, doctor,

21:19.347 --> 21:22.682
why is an adult establishment not ideal?

21:22.717 --> 21:27.220
It's inappropriate

21:27.255 --> 21:29.444
because of the whole...

21:31.058 --> 21:32.792
I mean, the people that go there.

21:32.827 --> 21:37.998
I mean, the people that work there.

21:38.032 --> 21:41.801
They're... you know...

21:41.836 --> 21:45.272
- Have you ever been to one?
- No!

21:47.275 --> 21:48.241
Why?

21:48.276 --> 21:55.881
[Jazz music]

22:01.422 --> 22:03.790
You're right. This is not distasteful.

22:03.824 --> 22:05.225
Of course it's not.

22:05.259 --> 22:07.827
These are regular women
trying to make a living.

22:07.862 --> 22:10.730
Like, take a look at this beautiful girl.

22:10.765 --> 22:13.567
I don't think you're allowed to...

22:13.601 --> 22:14.668
[Laughter]

22:14.702 --> 22:16.870
Jeremiah, meet my neighbor, hope.

22:16.904 --> 22:19.105
Hey, I guess now she's your neighbor too.

22:19.140 --> 22:20.941
Nice to meet you.

22:20.975 --> 22:23.710
Make sure you take care of my girl here.

22:23.744 --> 22:26.780
- [Coughs]
- Hope, you're up.

22:26.814 --> 22:31.685
Excuse me. I have to
go back to rehearsal.

22:31.719 --> 22:33.053
She seems nice.

22:33.087 --> 22:35.055
She is nice.

22:35.089 --> 22:38.224
You know, most of the girls
here, this is their first job.

22:38.259 --> 22:42.829
I mean, you didn't wake up one
day just being a doctor, right?

22:42.863 --> 22:44.531
- Hmm? Oh, no.
- No.

22:44.565 --> 22:48.101
How did you get your start?

22:48.135 --> 22:49.569
Eyeball courier.

22:49.604 --> 22:50.971
What?

22:51.005 --> 22:52.772
Eyeball courier.

22:52.807 --> 22:54.441
Eyeball courier?

22:54.475 --> 22:57.077
In med school, when
there were local accidents

22:57.111 --> 22:59.446
that involved a fatality,

22:59.480 --> 23:01.381
I would be called in to harvest the corneas

23:01.415 --> 23:03.216
and pack them in a special cooler

23:03.250 --> 23:04.751
to be sent for transplant.

23:04.785 --> 23:06.753
How did you get that job?

23:06.787 --> 23:10.423
I had the cooler.

23:10.458 --> 23:15.095
[Laughs]

23:20.968 --> 23:22.936
What was the worst job you ever had?

23:22.970 --> 23:25.572
Um, tending bar at the summerhouse.

23:25.606 --> 23:28.208
Maybe you've heard of it.

23:28.242 --> 23:29.676
You won't work there forever.

23:29.710 --> 23:31.144
No, no, no.

23:31.178 --> 23:36.449
I've always had the idea of
helping people who are in pain.

23:36.484 --> 23:38.952
So once I iron out a couple of problems,

23:38.986 --> 23:41.321
I'm gonna get my physical
therapist license.

23:41.355 --> 23:42.689
What kind of problems?

23:42.723 --> 23:44.958
Nothing I can't handle.

23:44.992 --> 23:48.310
But if it doesn't work out,
do you still have that cooler?

23:50.798 --> 23:54.134
[Laughs]

24:02.671 --> 24:03.429
Hey.

24:03.767 --> 24:05.735
Whose turn is it to go
first with Bob today?

24:05.769 --> 24:07.904
And what are we gonna talk about?

24:07.938 --> 24:09.972
The fact that my husband
gets dressed up for therapy?

24:10.007 --> 24:11.274
What? No.

24:11.308 --> 24:13.076
This might be my last chance to get changed

24:13.110 --> 24:14.310
before dinner at Ray's tonight.

24:14.344 --> 24:17.814
Guys like him appreciate business attire.

24:17.848 --> 24:20.683
Okay, two days ago, you
were warning me about Ray.

24:20.718 --> 24:22.218
The guy gives you one compliment,

24:22.252 --> 24:24.153
and suddenly you're rolling over
to let him scratch your tummy.

24:24.188 --> 24:26.022
I'm... what?

24:26.056 --> 24:27.490
Nobody's scratching anybody.

24:27.524 --> 24:29.625
Just turns out we come from
the same people, that's all.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.729
People who wear a cravat on weeknights?

24:32.763 --> 24:34.464
Okay, here's the thing.

24:34.498 --> 24:36.099
You know who never conquered the Hamptons?

24:36.133 --> 24:37.800
Mm, the Dutch?

24:37.835 --> 24:38.801
Genghis Khan?

24:38.836 --> 24:40.870
[Gasps] Cheesecake factory.

24:40.904 --> 24:42.638
Very good guesses.

24:42.673 --> 24:44.207
But no.

24:44.241 --> 24:45.775
People who work for free, that's who.

24:45.809 --> 24:47.143
What?

24:47.177 --> 24:48.945
You and Russel bought
pieces for Ray's restaurant

24:48.979 --> 24:50.747
without even looking over
the terms of the contract.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.915
He said he would sign it this afternoon.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.350
Is that a problem?

24:54.384 --> 24:56.719
Yes, it could be, if he starts
seeing you guys as pushovers.

24:56.754 --> 24:59.555
- Excuse me, pushovers?
- Yes.

24:59.590 --> 25:02.325
Nobody wants to hire someone
who looks too eager, Paige.

25:02.359 --> 25:04.260
People will want to hire us

25:04.294 --> 25:06.362
because we're good at what we do.

25:06.396 --> 25:08.064
The reason we're working for C.F.O.

25:08.098 --> 25:09.732
Is because he respects our taste.

25:09.767 --> 25:11.334
Okay, he may like your taste,

25:11.368 --> 25:12.401
but that's not what this is about.

25:12.436 --> 25:13.936
It's about leverage, Paige.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.472
Leverage, that's what guys like
me and Ray respect, leverage.

25:16.507 --> 25:17.740
Oh, yeah, guys like you and Ray.

25:17.775 --> 25:21.878
Yeah. Movers and shakers,
you know, self made men.

25:21.912 --> 25:23.613
All right, you ready to go to Bob's?

25:23.647 --> 25:27.016
Yeah, and I am definitely going first.

25:27.050 --> 25:28.384
No...

Hey, doc, let me borrow your nose,

25:45.736 --> 25:46.803
It's perfect.

25:46.837 --> 25:48.337

find the truffle in here.

25:51.041 --> 25:52.041
Come on, snap to it.

25:52.075 --> 25:53.109
Well, you seem to be doing better.

25:53.143 --> 25:54.110
Yeah.

25:54.144 --> 25:56.212
But I need you to be honest here.

25:56.246 --> 25:57.947
Did you drink more today than you claimed?

25:57.981 --> 25:59.482
No, it was just those few sips.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.650
All right? Why?

26:00.684 --> 26:03.352
Because I got your
blood alcohol level back.

26:03.387 --> 26:07.557
It was off the charts.

26:07.591 --> 26:11.460
Come here.

26:11.495 --> 26:14.997
I did feel drunk earlier, and on Tuesday,

26:15.032 --> 26:18.334
and on Sunday, it was
twice, maybe three times.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.002
I don't even know, but the point is,

26:20.037 --> 26:23.105
I used to be able to drink
a bottle before breakfast,

26:23.140 --> 26:25.942
okay, and I could still
cook a michelin-rated lunch,

26:25.976 --> 26:27.410
and now I can't even have three sips?

26:27.444 --> 26:28.411
I'm wasted?

26:28.445 --> 26:29.579
What's happening to me?

26:29.613 --> 26:31.347
There are several possibilities, okay?

26:31.381 --> 26:32.949
It could be liver disease.

26:32.983 --> 26:35.051
It could be chronic kidney conditions.

26:35.085 --> 26:36.519
So things that I did to myself.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.487
Well, not necessarily. The list is long.

26:38.522 --> 26:41.691
Yeah, well, so is my
list of bad decisions.

26:41.725 --> 26:44.026
I was young, thought I was bulletproof.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.095
Like, who thought it was gonna
wreck my career and my health?

26:46.129 --> 26:48.731
Look, we don't know anything yet, okay?

26:48.765 --> 26:50.366
For right now, I don't want
you drinking another drop.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.834
Yeah, obviously.

26:51.869 --> 26:54.637
And tomorrow I'll take you in
for a series of scans and tests,

26:54.671 --> 26:55.638
and once we know what's going on,

26:55.672 --> 26:57.974
we can make a plan of attack.

26:58.008 --> 26:58.975
All right.

for you, all right?

28:41.945 --> 28:45.214
I think I know what's happening.

28:45.248 --> 28:46.983
Dad, dad, what's going on?

28:47.017 --> 28:48.184
He's having a heart attack.

28:48.218 --> 28:50.152
No, it's his pacemaker, Ashley.

28:50.187 --> 28:51.887
Hold this. Hold this here. Squeeze.

28:51.922 --> 28:53.422
Where is your father's magnet?

28:53.457 --> 28:55.925
In his pockets usually.

28:55.959 --> 28:58.160
All right, use this
to reset his pacemaker.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.596
After this, he should be fine.

29:00.630 --> 29:02.932
It's not working.

29:02.966 --> 29:05.801
Okay, I'm gonna have to use an anesthetic.

29:05.836 --> 29:07.636
We're gonna have to make a small incision.

29:07.671 --> 29:11.207
All right, Dave.

29:11.241 --> 29:13.075
You're gonna feel a little pinch.

29:13.110 --> 29:14.777
Ready, Dave?

29:14.811 --> 29:15.957
All right.

29:19.349 --> 29:21.117
Just breathe.

29:26.656 --> 29:27.857
Okay, that wasn't so bad.

29:27.891 --> 29:31.594
But I'm not quite done yet.

29:31.628 --> 29:32.828
What is that?

29:32.863 --> 29:35.164
- His pacemaker.
- [Labored breathing]

29:35.198 --> 29:38.634
Oh.

29:40.504 --> 29:42.238
Okay. You can stop now.

29:42.272 --> 29:44.340
- He can breathe.
- Okay.

29:44.374 --> 29:45.941
Pacemakers aren't tied down.

29:45.976 --> 29:49.311
They sit loose in a
pocket just under the skin,

29:49.346 --> 29:51.881
and those wires are
supposed to be in your heart.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.483
Okay, you can sit up now.
You're gonna feel much better.

29:54.518 --> 29:58.187
- [Groans]
- Okay, good.

29:58.221 --> 30:00.790
Okay. Over here, over here.

30:00.824 --> 30:02.658
Dad.

30:02.692 --> 30:05.361
[Sighs] You fidget when you're nervous,

30:05.395 --> 30:07.530
and as you can see today,
you fidgeted with this

30:07.564 --> 30:10.232
enough to wrap the wire
around it like a yo-yo.

30:10.267 --> 30:11.300
Is that why he couldn't breathe?

30:11.334 --> 30:12.535
Yes.

30:12.569 --> 30:14.403
Once he pulled the wire
tips out of his heart,

30:14.438 --> 30:16.372
they stimulated everything they touched,

30:16.406 --> 30:18.874
including the nerve to your diaphragm.

30:18.909 --> 30:20.810
We refer to this habit
as twiddler's syndrome.

30:20.844 --> 30:23.212
So it wasn't a heart attack?

30:23.246 --> 30:24.213
No.

30:24.247 --> 30:27.083
Just concern for your daughter.

30:27.117 --> 30:30.553
Ashley, I'm so sorry about the trial.

30:30.587 --> 30:32.455
Divya had it under control.

30:32.489 --> 30:33.989
You didn't have to come in.

30:34.024 --> 30:35.491
Of course I did. I
don't care about my time.

30:35.525 --> 30:40.996
I only... for as long as I can remember,

30:41.031 --> 30:42.932
the one thing that I could always count on

30:42.966 --> 30:44.533
was hearing your voice,

30:44.568 --> 30:46.869
no matter where I was or what I was doing,

30:46.903 --> 30:49.839
and when I heard it, you
were right there with me,

30:49.873 --> 30:52.308
and I was safe.

30:52.342 --> 30:58.114
And then when I was out
there and I didn't hear you,

30:58.148 --> 31:00.249
you couldn't...

31:02.252 --> 31:06.255
[Crying]

31:20.194 --> 31:22.295
So I've been doing some thinking.

31:22.329 --> 31:24.897
- Hmm?
- There is a big wide world

31:24.932 --> 31:26.899
out there with so much new to explore.

31:26.934 --> 31:28.301
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:28.335 --> 31:30.069
And I know that if you
don't reach for your dreams,

31:30.103 --> 31:31.237
they could be gone in a heartbeat.

31:31.271 --> 31:33.206
- Totally.
- And that's why I think

31:33.240 --> 31:34.807
that you should go back to college.

31:34.842 --> 31:37.777
You think... you think I should...

31:37.811 --> 31:40.847
Wait a second. What are you...

31:41.882 --> 31:44.250
You left these in the kitchen.

31:44.284 --> 31:45.351
And I mean no offense

31:45.385 --> 31:47.119
because I really do appreciate the thought,

31:47.154 --> 31:50.256
but you barely know me.

31:50.290 --> 31:52.458
So... let's not do this.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.227
You know what? You're right.

31:54.261 --> 31:56.462
I do barely know you.

31:56.497 --> 31:57.964
All I know is that everyone needs someone

31:57.998 --> 32:00.333
to bounce things off of now and then.

32:00.367 --> 32:02.435
So I guess all this was just my way

32:02.469 --> 32:06.105
of volunteering to be that person for you.

32:06.139 --> 32:08.941
Thanks.

32:08.976 --> 32:11.611
But, I mean, you're that
person for everybody.

32:11.645 --> 32:15.047
So I guess I'm curious, who
do you bounce things off of?

32:15.082 --> 32:16.849
Oh. Um...

32:16.884 --> 32:19.352
Okay, well, then this is me

32:19.386 --> 32:22.321
offering to be that person for you.

32:22.356 --> 32:23.322
I accept.

32:23.357 --> 32:24.323
[Both chuckle]

32:24.358 --> 32:27.093
Good. Um...

32:27.127 --> 32:30.763
Yeah, and I don't want us to
hide things from one another.

32:30.797 --> 32:34.200
Your fancy new phone.

32:34.234 --> 32:35.701
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

32:35.736 --> 32:38.971
I mean, a 17-year-old
girl's got to text, right?

32:39.006 --> 32:40.139
LOL.

32:40.173 --> 32:42.842
Oh, L-O-L, right, got it.

32:42.876 --> 32:44.877
L-O-L.

32:53.086 --> 32:55.655
Hey, so I just want to talk
to you about a little wrinkle

32:55.689 --> 32:57.156
with Ray's lab space, okay?

32:57.190 --> 32:59.458
- We know it's a problem.
- About that...

32:59.493 --> 33:00.960
You know Ray broke Franklin's nose, right?

33:00.994 --> 33:03.162
I just... I'm fine with him as a patient,

33:03.196 --> 33:05.364
but do we really want to do business

33:05.399 --> 33:07.833
with someone so... impulsive?

33:07.868 --> 33:09.368
We're not, like, doing business with him.

33:09.403 --> 33:10.503
We're just renting his space.

33:10.537 --> 33:12.204
Look, the only real conversation point here

33:12.239 --> 33:14.140
is that it's next to a, uh...

33:14.174 --> 33:16.242
Well, it's a, uh...

33:16.276 --> 33:19.078
It's a burlesque club.
But it's very clean inside.

33:19.112 --> 33:20.513
We can put up soundproofing

33:20.547 --> 33:21.948
and use the back lot for parking.

33:21.982 --> 33:23.649
And the women employed
there work for a living

33:23.684 --> 33:25.184
just like everyone else
and shouldn't be judged,

33:25.218 --> 33:28.888
so we shouldn't judge them.

33:28.922 --> 33:30.356
Sounds like you guys
have this all under control.

33:30.390 --> 33:31.357
Great work.

33:31.391 --> 33:32.558
Oh, boy, don't tell me.

33:32.593 --> 33:35.695
The food is terrible. I know.

33:35.729 --> 33:38.531
So the big shot chef
comes through after all.

33:38.565 --> 33:42.134
Franklin, your cooking is magnificent.

33:42.169 --> 33:44.737
Your nose, well, it was
not great to begin with.

33:44.771 --> 33:46.005
- Won't happen again.
- Ha.

33:46.039 --> 33:49.275
So here, come, please, eat.

33:49.309 --> 33:51.544
Oh, yeah, no, thank you, that's great.

33:51.578 --> 33:53.412
But we're still open, so...

33:53.447 --> 33:56.215
Are you refusing to eat with me?

33:58.785 --> 34:00.886
Hey, it's your restaurant, right?

34:00.921 --> 34:02.888
Boss man tells me to eat, I'll eat.

34:02.923 --> 34:04.724
Let's do it. Come on.

34:04.758 --> 34:06.258
Put it down.

34:06.293 --> 34:08.393
Oh, this looks good.

34:11.098 --> 34:12.864
Oh, my God.

34:12.899 --> 34:14.433
That is good. Who made this?

34:14.467 --> 34:15.900
- [Laughter]
- You did.

34:15.936 --> 34:18.270
- Yeah.
- I did this?

34:18.304 --> 34:20.139
Excuse me. Are you Paige Lawson?

34:20.172 --> 34:22.408
- Cat Greenleaf!
- I am.

34:22.442 --> 34:24.110
And my husband and I
are buying a summer home,

34:24.143 --> 34:26.112
and I love the things
you found for the bar.

34:26.146 --> 34:27.612
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah, of course.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.614
- Great.
- And if you like those,

34:29.650 --> 34:31.650
there's this neoclassical
set I had my eye on...

34:31.685 --> 34:32.952
You know what? That's
probably a discussion

34:32.985 --> 34:34.587
better left for your initial
consultation, I think.

34:34.621 --> 34:36.822
So she's actually booking,
like, two weeks out right now.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.724
Why don't you just give us a call, okay?

34:38.759 --> 34:42.261
Or why don't you tell
her when she's ready to talk

34:42.295 --> 34:43.396
to give me a call?

34:43.429 --> 34:44.664
- All right.
- Okay.

34:44.697 --> 34:48.199
- Sure.
- Thanks.

34:48.235 --> 34:51.837
Huh?

34:51.871 --> 34:53.339
What?

34:53.373 --> 34:56.007
Listen, Passaic, I know
you're trying to help,

34:56.043 --> 34:58.678
but Russel and I don't
want to build an empire,

34:58.712 --> 35:01.747
so go take over the
Hamptons for someone else.

35:01.782 --> 35:04.350
I'm going to run my
business the way I want.

35:04.384 --> 35:05.885
Paige.

35:05.919 --> 35:07.853
[Footsteps recede]

35:14.061 --> 35:17.063
[Whispers] Who is it? Who is it?

35:17.097 --> 35:18.364
[Laughs]

35:18.398 --> 35:20.299
[Divya chuckles]

35:20.333 --> 35:22.868
I guess she didn't
roll over today after all,

35:22.903 --> 35:24.704
so you didn't miss anything.

35:24.738 --> 35:26.839
Yeah, I did.

35:26.873 --> 35:28.674
Thank you.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.343
In fact, thank you for all of your help.

35:31.378 --> 35:35.281
Sashi and I are very
lucky to have you, Nate.

35:35.315 --> 35:38.017
One more thing.

35:38.051 --> 35:40.386
I think that you should take that class.

35:40.420 --> 35:42.188
Really?

35:42.222 --> 35:43.355
- Mm
- Hmm.

35:43.390 --> 35:45.424
That's awesome.

35:45.459 --> 35:47.860
Uh... thanks.

35:47.894 --> 35:51.163
I'll see you in the morning.

35:51.198 --> 35:53.132
[Whispers] You want this?
You want this? You want...

35:53.166 --> 35:54.834
Okay.

35:54.868 --> 35:57.303
Oh.

35:57.337 --> 35:58.370
Mama.

35:58.405 --> 36:01.073
Mama was twiddling with your nannies.

36:01.108 --> 36:02.575
[Laughs]

36:02.609 --> 36:04.009
Yeah.

36:04.044 --> 36:07.646
I thought it was because
I disapproved of them.

36:07.681 --> 36:08.948
Yeah.

36:08.982 --> 36:14.820
But turns out, it was because
they got to be with you.

36:14.855 --> 36:17.056
But I made a decision.

36:17.090 --> 36:21.227
I'm going to start working part-time.

36:21.261 --> 36:22.928
Yeah.

36:22.963 --> 36:25.865
Now all we have to do is, uh,

36:25.899 --> 36:29.268
work out how to tell Uncle Hank

36:29.302 --> 36:32.104
and aunt Evan.

36:32.139 --> 36:34.940
[Low conversations]

36:41.782 --> 36:43.849
She didn't come.

36:43.884 --> 36:46.519
Your wife.

36:46.553 --> 36:48.521
Not even a call.

36:48.555 --> 36:51.157
- I'm sorry.
- Eh...

36:51.191 --> 36:53.659
It's my own fault.

36:53.693 --> 36:56.395
See, when Olivia and I were together,

36:56.429 --> 37:01.400
I paid more attention to
my work than I did to her.

37:01.434 --> 37:06.038
She wanted out of our
Jersey life, out of my life.

37:06.072 --> 37:09.875
And I didn't... I just didn't listen.

37:09.910 --> 37:12.444
And now...

37:12.479 --> 37:13.579
Right?

37:18.351 --> 37:22.822
Well, I'm sure she appreciates
how hard you're trying.

37:25.659 --> 37:27.760
[Slurring] Look at all
these beautiful people

37:27.794 --> 37:29.428
here on this beautiful night.

37:29.462 --> 37:31.997
You're so beautiful! [Laughing]

37:32.032 --> 37:33.465
Oh.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.202
You know what's missing
in this restaurant, Ray?

37:36.236 --> 37:39.038
It's the... the music. Why
is there no music in here?

37:39.072 --> 37:40.606
Franklin, why don't you
get back to the kitchen?

37:40.640 --> 37:41.941
What are you doing?

37:41.975 --> 37:43.309
Get off the table!

37:43.343 --> 37:45.110
He's right. Franklin, come on down.

37:45.145 --> 37:46.245
It's okay, because I brought my own band.

37:46.279 --> 37:48.080
[Imitates trumpet]

37:48.114 --> 37:51.417
[Silverware clattering]

37:53.053 --> 37:56.288
[Laughs, imitates trumpet]

37:56.323 --> 37:59.592
What are you doing? Come on.

37:59.626 --> 38:00.938
[Groans] Both: Oh!

38:00.938 --> 38:02.467
Oh, God!

38:03.779 --> 38:04.589
Franklin.

38:04.731 --> 38:07.199
[Laughing]

38:09.769 --> 38:11.170
[Groans]

38:11.204 --> 38:13.906
Oh, whoever's foot that
is, that's gotta hurt.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.208
[Laughing]

38:16.243 --> 38:18.644
I can't find a pulse.

38:18.678 --> 38:20.913
Franklin, you fractured
and dislocated your ankle.

38:20.947 --> 38:23.415
It's compressing the artery,
and the skin is tenting.

38:23.450 --> 38:25.618
If I don't reduce it now to
reestablish the blood supply,

38:25.652 --> 38:27.686
- you could lose your foot.
- Uh-oh.

38:27.721 --> 38:29.989
[Chuckles] Oh.

38:32.659 --> 38:35.127
- Okay.
- All right, this is gonna hurt.

38:35.161 --> 38:36.195
[Laughs]

38:36.229 --> 38:38.397
Or not.

- [Cracking]
- Oh! Oh!

38:40.433 --> 38:42.001
Oh, yeah! [Laughing]

38:42.035 --> 38:43.636
[Cracking]

38:43.670 --> 38:46.171
Good?

38:49.042 --> 38:51.810
Okay. I've got a pulse.

38:51.845 --> 38:54.046
[Sighs]

39:01.336 --> 39:04.601
- I have auto what?
- Auto-brewery syndrome.

39:04.678 --> 39:06.731
- And that's a thing?
- That's a thing.

39:06.817 --> 39:08.618
It's an overgrowth of yeast in your stomach

39:08.653 --> 39:11.988
that turns carbs like those in
bread and pasta into alcohol.

39:12.023 --> 39:13.657
We'll need cultures to confirm it,

39:13.691 --> 39:15.025
but I suspect it was caused

39:15.059 --> 39:16.927
by your excessive use of antibiotics

39:16.961 --> 39:18.762
from all your previous kitchen injuries.

39:18.796 --> 39:20.697
I wasn't getting drunk on wine,

39:20.731 --> 39:21.765
I was getting drunk on food?

39:21.799 --> 39:23.133
That's right.

39:23.167 --> 39:24.768
I'm like a walking home brew kit,

39:24.802 --> 39:26.937
- is what you're telling me?
- That's what I'm telling you.

39:26.971 --> 39:28.338
- Oh, man!
- And after a few weeks

39:28.372 --> 39:30.307
of Antifungal pills, you'll be fine,

39:30.341 --> 39:32.542
although your ankle might
take a little longer.

39:32.576 --> 39:34.144
Yeah. But I can go back to work?

39:34.178 --> 39:35.912
Yeah, Ray says it's fine with him.

39:35.947 --> 39:37.280
Especially since you can't dance.

39:37.315 --> 39:38.548
Are you talking about now,

39:38.582 --> 39:40.317
or are you commenting on
my table dancing skills

39:40.351 --> 39:41.318
from earlier?

39:41.352 --> 39:42.552
Oh, no, you had some moves.

39:42.586 --> 39:43.853
Recognize.

39:43.888 --> 39:45.021
[Laughs]

39:50.094 --> 39:52.062
[Sighs]

39:54.298 --> 39:56.099
You know what we've
got here, Hackensack,

39:56.133 --> 39:58.835
is something great.

39:58.869 --> 40:00.337
- You and me?
- Pfft!

40:00.371 --> 40:02.605
Those symphony people
think they're gonna bury us.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.007
They're not. We're gonna bury them.

40:04.041 --> 40:05.241
You know why?

40:05.276 --> 40:08.511
'Cause we know what matters, you and me.

40:08.546 --> 40:12.716
Roots, hard work, and family.

40:12.750 --> 40:14.184
Am I right?

40:14.218 --> 40:16.586
- Damn right, you're right.
- [Laughs]

40:18.089 --> 40:21.791
In fact, I was just thinking, Passaic,

40:21.826 --> 40:25.028
forget about these lease terms
and deposits and contracts.

40:25.062 --> 40:26.629
Let's make this easy.

40:26.664 --> 40:27.764
Do it as partners.

40:27.798 --> 40:32.936
The whole lab, you and me, 50-50.

40:32.970 --> 40:35.071
[Wine pouring] Clean, easy,

40:35.106 --> 40:37.073
[sets bottle down] Simple.

40:39.076 --> 40:41.911
Yeah, that's great.

40:41.946 --> 40:45.315
Partners, uh...

40:45.349 --> 40:48.084
I mean, extended ownership
is... it's a pretty big step,

40:48.119 --> 40:50.720
especially while we get
our finances in order

40:50.755 --> 40:52.756
with the equipment rentals
and the regulatory guidelines,

40:52.790 --> 40:54.858
but yeah, that's definitely
something we should

40:54.892 --> 40:59.763
plan on having a discussion
about in the future, for sure.

40:59.797 --> 41:02.165
Evan...

41:03.234 --> 41:06.736
We just had the discussion.
