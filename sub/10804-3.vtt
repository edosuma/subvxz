WEBVTT

00:32.366 --> 00:34.619
Stay down, Matty.
Don't get up.

01:00.729 --> 01:02.230
You need rest.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.619
No, no!

02:27.982 --> 02:29.400
Morning, sunshine.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.578
Someone better be getting my car.

04:04.662 --> 04:07.581
- Bundy's five minutes out.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.055
Keep the press out of here.

04:22.138 --> 04:25.141
No statements or photos
until we get this place spotless.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.851
-We control the narrative.
-Of course.

04:26.935 --> 04:29.771
And before you leave, Mr. Nelson
and Miss Page wanted a word.

04:29.854 --> 04:31.730
Ugh. Just one?
Can I get that in writing?

04:31.815 --> 04:34.108
Oh, because written agreements
suddenly mean something to you?

04:34.192 --> 04:36.360
You wanted your client
in witness protection, right?

04:36.861 --> 04:38.905
My offer's still valid for 23 minutes.

04:38.988 --> 04:41.490
- Grotto's gone.
- Too bad.

04:43.201 --> 04:44.702
You used our client for bait!

04:44.786 --> 04:46.537
That's a pretty big allegation--

04:46.620 --> 04:47.914
Allegation?

04:47.997 --> 04:49.833
Look around! This was a shit show!
He could have died.

04:49.916 --> 04:51.250
Let's be real honest here.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.086
No bullshit.

04:53.169 --> 04:54.587
Your firm is small-time.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.214
Your 15 minutes were up
after Union Allied.

04:56.339 --> 04:59.133
Right now, you are
way out of your league.

04:59.217 --> 05:00.218
Won't take much to sell

05:00.301 --> 05:02.053
that you're the ones
that compromised this operation.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.430
-What?
-Say that story goes public.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.725
The story that your incompetence
endangered the life of your client,

05:07.809 --> 05:10.854
neighborhood civilians,
and the brave officers of the NYPD.

05:10.937 --> 05:12.730
You are saying that you would
blame us for this?

05:12.814 --> 05:14.315
I never said that.
Did I say that?

05:14.398 --> 05:15.691
I didn't hear it.

05:15.774 --> 05:16.818
Stay away from this case.

05:20.905 --> 05:23.199
Nothing? Hmm?
Not even a little support?

05:23.282 --> 05:26.995
All the legal kung fu in the world
wouldn't have won that fight.

05:27.078 --> 05:29.163
--Her office could bury us.

05:29.247 --> 05:30.248
We shouldn't have pushed it.

05:30.874 --> 05:32.500
Yeah, well, you didn't push anything.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.710
I know how these assholes operate.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.670
We have to play it their way.
Just for now.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.882
But then what next?

05:38.965 --> 05:41.926
All right, Matt promised Grotto
we would protect him, so did I!

05:42.010 --> 05:43.636
I'm gonna call Matt now.

05:43.719 --> 05:46.680
Let's see if he's...
recuperated enough to help us out.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.350
All right,
I'm gonna go back to the office.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.186
I'm gonna see if I can find a way
that Reyes doesn't skin us alive.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.038
They say you don't hear
the bullet that gets you.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.542
Always thought that sounded like
a bunch of bullshit to me.

06:18.922 --> 06:20.464
How about you, Red?

06:21.215 --> 06:23.634
When I cracked off your forehead
the other night...

06:24.677 --> 06:26.554
did you hear that?

06:40.818 --> 06:42.028
Ahh!

06:46.574 --> 06:48.534
You can bash
against your chains all night.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.162
Only way you get out of here,

06:51.245 --> 06:53.581
only way you walk free,
is if I want you to.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.124
Know that.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.588
Why didn't you take my mask off?

07:02.131 --> 07:04.217
Don't give a shit
about who you are.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.262
You killed everyone else.

07:10.306 --> 07:12.641
- Why am I still alive?

07:17.063 --> 07:18.064
Huh?

07:19.023 --> 07:20.691
I got in your way twice now...

07:22.610 --> 07:25.321
and you don't strike me as someone
who just lets that happen.

07:46.259 --> 07:47.593
Military grade hardware.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.221
You seem to know your way around it.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.560
And you sure carry yourself
like a soldier.

08:06.029 --> 08:08.447
What are you gonna do with all this?

08:09.240 --> 08:11.242
I'll do what's required.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.788
--Yeah.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.248
We've been waiting six hours!

08:17.331 --> 08:19.292
- Come on, lady.
- Come on!

08:19.375 --> 08:20.876
Claire, damn it, pick up.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.545
If you get this, I'm in the ER.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.213
- We need to talk.

08:25.298 --> 08:26.340
Holy shit.

08:26.424 --> 08:28.259
Why don't you stop hasslin' me

08:28.342 --> 08:31.262
and go after the psycho
who blew away my crew!

08:31.345 --> 08:33.264
That's him!
That's the guy!

08:36.975 --> 08:39.103
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a nurse named Claire?

08:39.187 --> 08:41.814
-I believe she works the night shift.
-If she's here, she's busy.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.982
Could you just point me
in the right direction?

08:44.067 --> 08:45.151
-Are you injured?
-No.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.652
Do you wanna be?

08:46.735 --> 08:49.822
Mr. Carver? We can see you now.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.034
Why you telling me to wait?

08:53.117 --> 08:55.036
You've been telling me this
for like an hour already.

08:55.119 --> 08:58.914
Hey, get your hands off me!
I didn't say nothin'. Come on!

09:00.749 --> 09:03.001
Oh, man, that's our boy.
He got jumped.

09:07.465 --> 09:09.300
I know your cousin.
I know where you live.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.509
No, he's no good.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.720
I'm sittin', man, all right?
I'm not startin' nothin'.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.597
Just relax, all right?

09:14.680 --> 09:16.765
- That's what you tell me?
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

09:16.849 --> 09:19.352
-Quiet! Sit down!
-Yeah? We're not startin' nothin', man!

09:19.435 --> 09:22.313
-He's the one that started it, all right?
-You keep it up, you're out of here.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.066
You're a dead man, you understand?
As soon as you get out.

09:25.149 --> 09:26.984
Hey, listen up.

09:27.068 --> 09:29.195
Police are waiting
to take you into custody.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.323
The last thing I need is for you
to come back here in two weeks,

09:32.406 --> 09:33.449
asking what happened,

09:33.532 --> 09:36.494
and blaming one of our people
for your mistakes.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.329
Hey, so let me put this simply.

09:39.330 --> 09:41.124
Yesterday, you had five fingers.

09:41.207 --> 09:43.501
But tonight, you got loaded and decided
to hit up a rival clubhouse.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.918
So now you have two.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.629
We're at war, lady.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.172
Listen to me.

09:48.256 --> 09:50.466
Had five.
Now two.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.926
Your fault.
That clear?

09:55.263 --> 09:56.472
Good.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.475
The meds should kick in soon.

10:02.811 --> 10:03.812
Claire.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.857
Foggy Nelson.
We have a mutual friend.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.066
Remember me?

10:08.151 --> 10:10.236
Shit.

10:27.170 --> 10:30.005
- Nelson and Murdock, may I help you?
- What the hell was that?

10:31.006 --> 10:32.049
Grotto?

10:33.217 --> 10:34.218
Grotto, where are you?

10:34.302 --> 10:36.345
Like I'd tell you shit
after what went down.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.473
-Are you hurt?
-Forget all that.

10:40.516 --> 10:41.767
You gonna help me out or not?

10:41.850 --> 10:43.394
- Uh, yeah, uh, we'll try--
- Try?

10:43.477 --> 10:47.064
Look, you have to believe me,
we had no idea what Reyes was planning--

10:47.148 --> 10:49.483
Shut up! Shut up!
Goddamn lawyers, you're all alike.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.444
Runnin' your mouths,
all that fancy talk...

10:51.527 --> 10:53.404
All the time you're just stickin' it
to guys like me.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.113
-Grotto--
-You made promises, lady!

10:55.198 --> 10:56.615
--You broke every one of 'em.

10:56.699 --> 10:57.783
I know.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.035
I'm sorry.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.289
Listen, Grotto,
the police are coming after you.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.373
You have to come in.

11:04.457 --> 11:06.750
All that shootin', it was...
it was 'cause of him, wasn't it?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.252
The psycho from the hospital?

11:08.336 --> 11:10.379
-Yeah.
-Shit.

11:10.463 --> 11:12.089
Shit. He's never gonna stop.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.967
Look, the DA knows she screwed up.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.720
We can go back to her.
We can lock in witness protection--

11:17.803 --> 11:18.887
I'm done makin' deals, sweetheart.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.139
I've got my own plan now,

11:21.224 --> 11:23.892
gettin' outta this hellhole
while I'm still breathin'.

11:23.976 --> 11:26.520
You tell that donut of a lawyer
and the blind man,

11:26.604 --> 11:27.896
they can kiss my ass.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.147
Grotto, please--

11:29.232 --> 11:30.941
- You can go to hell.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.014
This another one
of your missions?

12:04.182 --> 12:06.143
That's why we're here, isn't it?

12:10.356 --> 12:11.357
How many will this make?

12:15.193 --> 12:16.820
I'm guessing you've done this, what...

12:16.904 --> 12:19.072
ten, maybe 20 times?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.669
How long's it been?

12:34.755 --> 12:36.131
Six months, a year...

12:36.799 --> 12:37.883
or your whole life?

12:41.470 --> 12:43.681
Something tells me you don't take breaks.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.395
You know, no one else has to die.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.815
You could stop now.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.025
Walk away.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.239
Walk away?

13:02.491 --> 13:03.867
Could you do that?

13:04.868 --> 13:06.036
Could you walk away?

13:10.165 --> 13:11.291
Yeah.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.012
What is that, midnight?

13:25.263 --> 13:26.807
St. Matthew's.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.769
You a Catholic?

13:32.813 --> 13:33.939
Once.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.317
From New York?

13:38.902 --> 13:40.278
Once.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.199
You still go to Mass?

13:45.075 --> 13:46.827
Stop now, Red.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.287
-Stop?
-Stop digging.

13:49.372 --> 13:50.581
Ah.

13:58.381 --> 14:00.383
You know, a funny thing about New York...

14:01.884 --> 14:03.761
few people are actually from here.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.514
The ones who are...

14:07.431 --> 14:09.307
they don't leave.
They can't, they, uh...

14:09.392 --> 14:11.560
They feel like the city's a part of them.

14:12.603 --> 14:13.604
You know?

14:16.607 --> 14:19.443
Until one day, something changes.
Maybe they get older.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.072
And then they have to leave,
they have to get out.

14:24.657 --> 14:25.949
See the world, maybe.

14:27.743 --> 14:28.952
Maybe they enlist?

14:31.955 --> 14:33.707
Where'd they send you?

14:35.501 --> 14:36.752
You a shrink, Red?

14:39.630 --> 14:43.592
Now, come on, you must be something when
you're not wearing the long johns, right?

14:44.760 --> 14:46.804
-I'm just a guy.
-Yeah?

14:48.346 --> 14:50.015
You ever been to war?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.643
No.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.396
Yeah... then don't talk about it.

14:57.398 --> 14:58.982
I've seen some fights.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.401
Sure you have.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.945
Well, I almost had you beat.

15:04.029 --> 15:07.282
You talk about trading hands
on a rooftop, Red.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.036
I'm talking about shit, okay?

15:11.662 --> 15:13.747
Shit that you ain't been in.

15:13.831 --> 15:15.583
-I know one thing.
-What's that?

15:15.666 --> 15:17.292
War changes people.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.547
Sometimes they see things
they can't unsee.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.717
Come home to find home's
not there anymore.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.802
- It changed.

15:26.885 --> 15:27.970
Or maybe they did.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.138
Yeah, fair enough.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.599
I'm just saying,
I know it can be hard.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.560
Do you?

15:34.643 --> 15:36.353
You know it can be hard?

15:37.354 --> 15:38.522
You run around this city

15:38.606 --> 15:40.941
in a pair of little boy's pajamas
and a mask.

15:42.317 --> 15:46.363
You go home at night, right?
Take that mask off, maybe you think...

15:46.447 --> 15:49.742
it wasn't you who did those things,
maybe it was somebody else.

15:50.868 --> 15:52.495
Well, see, soldiers...

15:52.578 --> 15:54.622
we don't wear masks, yeah?

15:54.705 --> 15:56.457
We don't get that privilege.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.964
-You know what I think?
-What's that?

16:04.047 --> 16:06.884
-You're still at war.
-Oh, for crying out loud.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.969
So, you charge by the hour,
doc, or what?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.225
Why am I here?

16:15.308 --> 16:18.353
Everything you do out there
in the streets, Red, it doesn't work.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.981
-Did you know that?
-Oh, and what you're doing is better?

16:21.064 --> 16:23.651
What I do, I just do.
It's out of necessity.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.611
Come on.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.488
You know you're not the only one, right?

16:27.571 --> 16:30.616
Who did you lose? Huh?

16:30.699 --> 16:32.409
Was it someone you loved?

16:32.493 --> 16:34.286
Well, boo-hoo.
Let me tell you something, buddy.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.497
Everybody's lost someone.
Doesn't mean you have to do this.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.874
Well, loss doesn't work the same
for everybody, Red.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.959
Yeah, that's right.
It's clearly not working for you.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.503
Maybe not.

16:42.586 --> 16:45.297
We don't get to pick
the things that fix us, Red.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.090
Make us whole.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.552
Make us feel purpose.

16:49.635 --> 16:53.388
My moment of clarity?
It came from the strangest of places.

16:55.015 --> 16:58.018
What kind of name is
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen, anyway?

16:58.101 --> 16:59.394
I mean, really?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.356
I didn't ask for that name.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.108
I'm sorry,
I don't see you running from it.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.359
I don't do this to hurt people.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.946
-Yeah, so what is that, just a job perk?
-I don't kill anyone.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.781
Is that why you think
you're better than me?

17:10.864 --> 17:13.241
-No.
-Is that why you think you're a big hero?

17:13.325 --> 17:15.911
It doesn't matter what I think
or what I am.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.204
People don't have to die.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.664
Come on, Red.
You believe that?

17:18.747 --> 17:20.833
I believe it's not my call,
and it ain't yours either.

17:20.916 --> 17:24.753
Somebody ask you to put on that costume
or you take it upon yourself?

17:25.754 --> 17:27.923
You know what I think of you, hero?

17:28.966 --> 17:31.093
I think you're a half-measure.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.596
I think you're a man
who can't finish the job.

17:33.679 --> 17:35.305
I think that you're a coward.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.560
You know the one thing
that you just can't see?

17:39.643 --> 17:42.520
You know you're one bad day away
from being me.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.942
--Yeah.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.070
Someone's coming.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.155
Shit.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.742
-Guess I'd better make a run for it.
-Hey, don't hurt him.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.994
Yeah? Let's hope he doesn't
give me a reason to.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.579
What's all that noise?

17:58.662 --> 18:02.332
If it's you damned kids again,
I swear I'm callin' the cops!

18:02.415 --> 18:04.251
I'll say this once, Red.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.418
You make one sound,

18:05.502 --> 18:07.713
and I'll open his head up
all over this roof.

18:08.964 --> 18:09.965
Hello?

18:17.723 --> 18:19.224
This is really not a good time.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.976
-What's going on in here?
-You tell me.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.604
-I have patients stacked up in four halls.
-Look, I get it.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.188
You're up to your eyeballs.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.314
But I got a problem too,

18:26.398 --> 18:28.859
and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
good and goddamn urgent.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.069
I'm looking for a certain
mutual friend of ours.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.696
Ouch! Careful, bitch.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.159
I haven't seen him.
I've been on ER duty all month.

18:37.242 --> 18:40.704
No breaks. I haven't been able
to walk outside of these walls lately.

18:40.788 --> 18:42.414
Sounds like
you pissed somebody off.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.457
Yeah, I'm getting really good at that.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.335
You rip that, you're gonna have
to re-stitch it yourself.

18:47.419 --> 18:48.754
So he hasn't been here?

18:48.837 --> 18:50.714
He have a reason to be?

18:50.798 --> 18:53.050
Well, you know,
our friend is fond of extreme sports.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.929
You can cut the shit.
I know who you're talking about.

18:57.012 --> 18:59.556
I thought maybe he came
to you for help again.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.058
The last time he came to me for help,

19:01.141 --> 19:03.936
I wound up elbow deep
in our mutual friend's blood.

19:04.019 --> 19:06.146
I'm never doing that again.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.816
Well, maybe you can help me check records.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.984
See if he's come in anywhere else.

19:11.068 --> 19:12.319
Look...

19:13.320 --> 19:14.822
I know why you're worried.

19:15.906 --> 19:18.450
He's been building himself
quite the rep lately.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.202
Is this something I want to hear?

19:20.285 --> 19:22.370
Yo, lady, where the hell
am I supposed to go now?

19:23.538 --> 19:25.373
You want the ER perspective?

19:25.457 --> 19:26.875
Victims love him.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.711
Victimizers?

19:28.794 --> 19:30.587
Want him more dead than ever.

19:32.798 --> 19:34.925
Look, if you're gonna follow me around...

19:35.926 --> 19:37.302
at least make yourself useful.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.972
Here...

19:40.055 --> 19:41.598
look around the other side of the table.

19:41.682 --> 19:44.226
I'm not sure I'm qualified for this.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.603
You're breathing, you're not in cuffs,
you're on the team.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.063
Spray when I say.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.398
Look, I care about our friend.

19:50.482 --> 19:53.193
I believe in what he's doing,
I believe the city needs him.

19:53.276 --> 19:56.154
But the truth is, I can't help anymore.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.490
I've got this shift from hell

19:58.573 --> 20:01.159
'cause I helped another friend
trying to do good.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.161
Big guy.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.788
Stronger than our friend.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.166
And yet I'm the one
who got the shaft.

20:09.292 --> 20:12.545
I'm just trying to keep my head down,
do my job...

20:13.296 --> 20:15.257
stay sane.
Spray.

20:16.216 --> 20:19.511
Trust me, I don't like being
a part of this any more than you do.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.805
But I need to find him.

20:21.889 --> 20:23.598
I'd do it myself, but I'm out of ideas.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.518
Listen, as close as he gets, Matt's...

20:26.601 --> 20:28.103
pretty good at not getting himself killed.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.647
I'm not so sure about that anymore.

20:30.731 --> 20:33.358
Easy, dumb-ass.
My leg is killing me.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.737
So, you've probably been
pulling in lots of DOAs lately.

20:36.820 --> 20:37.905
- Criminal types?

20:37.988 --> 20:40.032
There's been a serious uptick
in gunshot wounds,

20:40.115 --> 20:41.992
now that you mention it.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.952
Something's really
got the gangs riled.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.996
It's a "someone."

20:46.079 --> 20:49.041
And the freak responsible
is the one Matt's up against.

20:49.624 --> 20:52.044
I'll be out of your hair
before you know it, but, please...

20:52.669 --> 20:54.462
he's my best friend.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.089
I just need to make sure he's okay.

20:57.174 --> 21:00.260
- You son of a bitch!
- See what you got, punk! Come on!

21:00.343 --> 21:02.179
- Come on, get over here!

21:02.262 --> 21:04.807
- I'll crack your stupid head open!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:04.890 --> 21:07.017
- Somebody call security.
- Calm down!

21:12.647 --> 21:14.357
Who the hell are you?

21:16.234 --> 21:17.235
Frank.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.779
What are you doing up here, Frank?

21:19.780 --> 21:23.533
Well, the truth is, um,
I'm pretty sure that this here roof,

21:23.616 --> 21:25.285
right here, this is the, uh...

21:25.368 --> 21:28.872
this is the last patch of real estate
in the entire goddamn United States

21:28.956 --> 21:31.541
where a man can just have a little peace,
be by himself, and...

21:31.624 --> 21:33.543
have a smoke.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.839
Never seen you around.

21:36.922 --> 21:40.258
Yeah, no. I'm, uh, in town
just visiting my crazy sister.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.845
- Betty in 2B?

21:42.928 --> 21:45.138
I see you've had the pleasure.

21:45.222 --> 21:47.349
-Can't say I blame you.
-Nah.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.642
My wife's the same.
Made me quit a long time ago.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.061
--You know what they say.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.354
- It's for our health.

21:52.437 --> 21:53.981
What about the enjoyment of life?

21:55.148 --> 21:57.067
Guess they'll worry
about that when they're dead.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.198
What was that?

22:04.032 --> 22:06.284
Uh, it's just... just a rat.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.371
- We exterminated.

22:10.247 --> 22:13.291
Lot of guys...
they half-ass it.

22:14.042 --> 22:17.254
Remember my uncle used to tell me
that all the time. He fumigated.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.338
Hard work.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.883
Yeah, well.
It's all he could get after the war.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.384
You know, curse of a soldier.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.635
Ain't that the truth.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.845
Yeah. You serve?

22:25.929 --> 22:27.931
'Nam, 3rd Marine Division.

22:28.015 --> 22:29.724
Fighting 3rd, huh?

22:29.807 --> 22:31.809
Goddamn right. You?

22:31.894 --> 22:33.811
Yeah, yeah.
Iraq, Afghanistan.

22:36.106 --> 22:37.815
Welcome home.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.234
Thank you, sir.

22:40.485 --> 22:43.071
I gotta go down right now, but, you...

22:43.155 --> 22:45.823
you smoke as much as you like, son.

22:45.908 --> 22:48.743
- Thank you, sir. All right.
- All right, son.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.043
-Hey, Marine!
-Yeah?

22:56.126 --> 22:57.377
Semper Fi.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.354
Frank.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.232
That's your real name?

23:21.568 --> 23:24.321
-You get off threatening innocent people?
-He was only in danger

23:24.404 --> 23:25.905
because you squealed,
because you can't follow orders--

23:25.989 --> 23:27.740
You had a gun on him.
You thumbed back the hammer.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.617
Yeah, well, that was for you.
Part of the show.

23:31.328 --> 23:33.496
What does that mean?

23:33.580 --> 23:36.416
I really have to spell it out
for you, Red? Huh?

23:36.499 --> 23:39.502
I'm disappointed.
Listen carefully, okay?

23:39.586 --> 23:41.213
- You listening? Yeah? How 'bout now?

23:41.296 --> 23:42.965
You listening?
Feel it?

23:46.218 --> 23:47.635
I'm not a bad guy, Red.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.431
You wanna explain that to the orphans and
the widows of the men you killed?

23:51.514 --> 23:53.350
For Christ's sake, that's what you think?

23:53.433 --> 23:56.478
I'm just some crazy asshole going around
unloading on whoever I want to?

23:56.561 --> 23:58.021
Yeah,
that's exactly what I think.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.564
- That it?
- You think you're anything else?

23:59.647 --> 24:02.317
I think that the people I kill
need killing, that's what I think.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.611
You left men hanging
from meat hooks!

24:04.694 --> 24:06.154
They got off easy,
in my opinion.

24:06.238 --> 24:07.780
You shot up a hospital.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.574
Yeah, and nobody got hurt
who didn't deserve it.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.618
Oh, yeah.
What about you, Frank?

24:11.701 --> 24:14.287
What happens the day
someone decides you deserve it?

24:14.371 --> 24:16.456
I'll tell you what, they better not miss.

24:16.539 --> 24:19.834
Come on, you run around this city
like it's your damn shooting gallery.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.420
-You think you do--
-Yeah, what do you do? What do you do?

24:22.504 --> 24:25.173
You act like it's a playground.
You beat up the bullies with your fists.

24:25.257 --> 24:28.260
You throw 'em in jail,
everybody calls you a hero, right?

24:28.343 --> 24:30.053
And then a month, a week, a day later,

24:30.137 --> 24:32.264
they're back on the streets
doing the same goddamn thing--

24:32.347 --> 24:34.391
Yeah, so you just
put 'em in the morgue.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.101
You're goddamn right, I do.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.311
-You ever doubt yourself, Frank?
-Not even for a second.

24:38.395 --> 24:41.148
Really? Really?
You never think for one second,

24:41.231 --> 24:43.691
"Shit, I just killed a human being."

24:43.775 --> 24:44.859
That's being pretty generous.

24:44.942 --> 24:48.030
A human being who did
a lot of stupid shit, maybe even evil,

24:48.113 --> 24:50.282
but had one small piece
of goodness in him.

24:50.365 --> 24:52.159
Maybe just a scrap, Frank, but something.

24:52.242 --> 24:55.037
And then you come along,
and that one tiny flicker of light

24:55.120 --> 24:56.163
gets snuffed out forever.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.044
I think you're wrong.

25:02.127 --> 25:03.753
-Which part?
-All of it.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.381
I think there's no good in the filth
that I put down, that's what I think.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.550
-And how do you know?
-I just know.

25:08.633 --> 25:11.178
Look around, Red.
This city, it stinks. It's a sewer.

25:11.261 --> 25:14.347
It stinks and it smells like shit
and I can't get the stink out of my nose.

25:14.431 --> 25:17.975
I think that this world, it needs men
that are willing to make the hard call.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.853
-I think you and me are the same!
-That's bullshit, Frank, and you know it!

25:20.937 --> 25:22.647
Only I do the one thing that you can't.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.982
You hit 'em, and they get back up.
I hit 'em, and they stay down.

25:25.067 --> 25:28.153
It's permanent. I make sure that they
don't make it out on the street again.

25:28.236 --> 25:29.237
I take pride in that.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.363
-Let me ask you this.
-What's that?

25:30.447 --> 25:31.573
-What about hope?
-Oh, fuck.

25:31.656 --> 25:32.990
-Come on, Frank--
-You wanna talk about Santa Claus?

25:33.075 --> 25:34.076
You wanna talk about Santa Claus?

25:34.159 --> 25:35.618
I live in the real world too,
and I've seen it.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.287
-Yeah? What have you seen?
-Redemption, Frank.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.955
-Ah, Jesus Christ.
-It's real. And it's possible.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.832
The people you murder
deserve another chance.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.584
What, to kill again? Rape again?
Is that what you want?

25:42.667 --> 25:45.044
No, Frank.
To try again, Frank.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.754
To try.

25:46.838 --> 25:47.922
And if you don't get that,

25:48.005 --> 25:49.757
there's something broken in you
you can't fix,

25:49.841 --> 25:51.134
and you really are a nutjob.

25:53.553 --> 25:54.679
What did you say?

25:54.762 --> 25:56.681
You're...

25:56.764 --> 25:59.392
You're unhinged... Frank.

25:59.476 --> 26:01.060
You are.

26:01.144 --> 26:04.189
You think God made you
a one-man firing squad.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.357
But you're wrong.

26:06.191 --> 26:08.360
There is goodness in people,
even in you.

26:08.443 --> 26:09.486
And you're gonna have to kill me,

26:09.569 --> 26:11.028
'cause I'm never gonna stop
coming for you,

26:11.113 --> 26:12.947
- until I take you down.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.241
-You wanna know why?
-Why's that?

26:15.283 --> 26:17.660
-Because you're insane.
-Hmm.

26:31.883 --> 26:33.260
Late night?

26:33.343 --> 26:35.345
What are you doing here?

26:35.428 --> 26:38.348
Protecting our client,
who is still out there, alone.

26:38.431 --> 26:41.893
You're talking about him
like he's a... a lost puppy.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.979
Mr. Grote is a convicted criminal
and lucky we gave him the time of day.

26:45.062 --> 26:46.564
--I'd forget about him if I were you.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.815
We promised to protect him.

26:47.899 --> 26:49.526
Maybe you shouldn't have.

26:52.279 --> 26:56.115
Your boss said she could take down
a firm like ours pretty quickly.

26:56.199 --> 26:57.200
She wasn't lying.

26:57.284 --> 26:58.493
Huh...

26:58.576 --> 27:01.954
So, she could also take down
someone like you?

27:04.916 --> 27:07.377
ADA Elliot James.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.629
Took the fall after Reyes
mishandled informants

27:09.712 --> 27:12.048
in the, uh, Teller case about a year ago.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.466
Nicole Kent got booted

27:13.550 --> 27:16.511
from your office after she failed
to quiet the EnSynth scandal.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.639
Chris Davidson...

27:19.722 --> 27:20.723
did you ever meet him?

27:22.184 --> 27:25.353
Fired after the State Supreme Court
disqualified your entire office

27:25.437 --> 27:29.274
from the Pell case due to
"widespread misconduct."

27:30.400 --> 27:31.776
"Widespread."

27:33.653 --> 27:34.987
But not everyone got fired.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.365
See, Reyes walked out in one piece.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.035
She's good at throwing
people to the wolves.

27:41.869 --> 27:44.831
So, sure, she can take down
Nelson and Murdock this month,

27:44.914 --> 27:46.165
but how long

27:46.249 --> 27:49.377
before you are getting
pulled into the shit with the rest of us?

27:51.170 --> 27:52.922
You trying to scare me?

27:53.005 --> 27:55.883
I am here to show you
that you and Reyes

27:55.967 --> 27:57.552
are not on the same team.

28:01.223 --> 28:02.599
Where would you even find this shit?

28:04.392 --> 28:06.228
I want protection for Nelson and Murdock.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.646
We're small.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.357
We can't survive getting
thrown to the wolves.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.066
Not without your help.

28:13.443 --> 28:15.653
After what happened today,
someone's gonna crash and burn

28:15.737 --> 28:18.406
and I need to know that
that won't be us.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.077
What makes you think I can help you,
even if I wanted to?

28:24.996 --> 28:27.665
-You have information on the Punisher.
-That's classified.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.751
Do I look like I'm gonna post it
on YouTube?

28:30.752 --> 28:33.004
Your boss is threatening
to disbar my friends

28:33.087 --> 28:34.714
and dismantle our law firm.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.592
Yeah, my boss is a piece of work.

28:40.136 --> 28:42.930
Look, how will the Punisher files,
assuming they even exist,

28:43.014 --> 28:44.516
help you stop that from happening?

28:47.227 --> 28:50.438
- I'll let you know.

28:50.522 --> 28:51.898
Unbelievable.

28:53.358 --> 28:57.111
So, you expect me to implicate
the DA on purpose?

28:59.739 --> 29:00.948
Listen very carefully.

29:02.074 --> 29:05.245
You cannot come into my office,
asking me to betray my boss,

29:05.328 --> 29:09.499
throwing around allegations about
this department you cannot substantiate.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.960
So I'm going downstairs to get security.

29:17.131 --> 29:19.384
And you will not contact me again.

29:19.467 --> 29:22.011
No emails. No phone calls. Nothing.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.602
Good night, Miss Page.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.158
- You're dead!
- Go to hell!

29:44.241 --> 29:46.869
They found Freddie Bones
with ten slugs to his chest!

29:46.953 --> 29:48.204
That wasn't us, prick.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.416
-This happen often?
-It's been a bad week.

29:52.584 --> 29:54.210
Shit.

29:54.294 --> 29:57.964
-Put it down! Put it down!
-Back off!

29:58.047 --> 29:59.256
There's innocent people here!

29:59.341 --> 30:00.550
This ain't got nothin' to do with you.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.344
You're gonna hurt somebody.

30:02.427 --> 30:05.513
I'm not gonna tell
you again. Put it down, now!

30:06.556 --> 30:09.434
Hey, asshole.
How many priors you got?

30:09.517 --> 30:10.602
What'd you say to me?

30:10.685 --> 30:12.228
I asked you about your priors.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.981
Yeah, keep talking shit.
I'll check you into ICU myself.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.858
You got face tattoos, friend.

30:16.941 --> 30:19.902
That's like telegraphing,
"I know what prison meatloaf tastes like."

30:19.986 --> 30:21.613
You just better step back, now.

30:21.696 --> 30:25.408
I'm not gonna ask if you know what happens
when you get charged with assault.

30:25.492 --> 30:28.745
I got a hunch you got more mug shots
than baby pictures back home.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.037
Man, who are you?

30:30.121 --> 30:33.124
I'm the pro-bono suit you'll try to retain
after you go down for this.

30:33.207 --> 30:35.960
Only not even my soft-hearted partner
will take your case,

30:36.043 --> 30:38.505
or any other self-respecting
attorney in Hell's Kitchen.

30:38.588 --> 30:40.715
Not because you're so badass,

30:40.798 --> 30:43.050
but because you're just that stupid.

30:43.134 --> 30:45.052
You got a big mouth, asshole.

30:45.136 --> 30:47.514
You forget, I do this for a living.

30:48.723 --> 30:51.308
I could ask you to look at the faces
of the other patients.

30:51.393 --> 30:53.310
Every last one of 'em
scared to death,

30:53.395 --> 30:55.980
because the two of you
can't keep it in your pants.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.816
But I'm guessing that neither one of you
could give a collective shit.

30:58.900 --> 31:04.489
So I'm gonna do what attorneys do best
and appeal to your selfish natures.

31:04.572 --> 31:07.450
Simply put,
if you carve each other up now,

31:07.534 --> 31:11.078
in front of these witnesses,
with cops right outside,

31:11.162 --> 31:12.872
you're screwed!

31:12.955 --> 31:14.290
I can't just walk away, man.

31:15.082 --> 31:18.169
I'm not asking you to lose
the oh-so-serious stink-eye.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.005
Just don't fight!

31:23.633 --> 31:25.677
Put 'em down.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.845
Let these people do their jobs.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.141
Come on.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.493
--You all right?

31:50.577 --> 31:52.369
Son of a bitch.

32:04.757 --> 32:08.135
.357, one round in the chamber.

32:10.012 --> 32:12.389
Some things, they just...

32:12.474 --> 32:14.308
They feel right in your hand, huh?

32:15.435 --> 32:17.854
I know what you're thinking, Red.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.647
You could put a round in my arm,
in my leg,

32:19.731 --> 32:22.024
but it's not gonna work,
'cause I'm all geared up.

32:22.108 --> 32:24.486
Only way you stop me is with a head shot.

32:24.569 --> 32:26.946
-I'm not gonna shoot you.
-Nope.

32:27.572 --> 32:28.865
Not yet, you're not.

32:34.454 --> 32:37.164
Time to put a face to all your fancy talk
about redemption.

32:38.249 --> 32:41.127
Elliot Grote, a.k.a. Grotto.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.545
I don't wanna die.

32:42.629 --> 32:43.963
What did you do to him?

32:44.046 --> 32:46.508
I caught this piece of shit
stealing a car, trying to skip town.

32:46.591 --> 32:48.468
I was scared.
I'm sorry, I was running for my life.

32:48.551 --> 32:49.802
- Shut up.
- Stop it, Frank.

32:49.886 --> 32:52.597
He doesn't deserve to die,
just 'cause you caught him stealing cars.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.806
Is that what you think?

32:53.890 --> 32:55.266
It's up to the law, not me and not you!

32:55.349 --> 32:57.226
Why don't you tell him a little bit
about yourself?

32:57.309 --> 32:59.270
- You have no right to do this!
- I'm nothing.

32:59.353 --> 33:00.730
- I'm just nobody.
- Oh, yeah? That all?

33:00.813 --> 33:02.524
I pour their drinks.
I drive their cars.

33:02.607 --> 33:04.567
You were doing a little more than that
a few months ago.

33:05.735 --> 33:07.194
What are you trying
to prove, Frank?

33:07.278 --> 33:09.489
- You're trying to step up.
- No.

33:09.572 --> 33:10.865
- No?
- Who are you?

33:10.948 --> 33:14.035
Lafayette Street, 2nd floor.
Why don't you tell him what happened?

33:14.118 --> 33:16.037
- Please, I'm sorry.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.164
-Please, please, I'm sorry.
-You tell him now.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.416
Frank, I'm not gonna shoot you, Frank.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.710
Nothing happened, I'm sorry.

33:23.753 --> 33:25.922
--I'm only gonna ask you one more time.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.298
Ahh!

33:27.381 --> 33:28.883
I didn't know!
It was an address!

33:28.966 --> 33:30.927
This guy,
I didn't even know his name.

33:31.010 --> 33:34.138
He... he got wobbly with the wrong people,

33:34.221 --> 33:37.266
owed something to somebody,
'cause the order came from on high.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.601
- Yeah?

33:38.685 --> 33:40.102
What orders?

33:40.186 --> 33:42.146
- The sort you can't say no to.
- Say the words!

33:43.355 --> 33:44.899
You say it.
Do you hear me?

33:44.982 --> 33:46.067
You don't understand
these animals.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.652
You can't back out.
You can't...

33:47.735 --> 33:50.321
Just shut up!
Stop talking, Grotto.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.406
- You say it.

33:53.449 --> 33:55.577
--I won't ask again.

33:56.493 --> 33:57.662
Say the words, asshole!

33:57.745 --> 33:59.789
I did it, I killed him!
I killed him.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.082
-I put two in his head.
-No!

34:01.165 --> 34:03.209
- But, I swear to God...
- Oh, God damn it.

34:05.920 --> 34:09.173
I didn't know... I didn't know
the old lady was in the house.

34:09.256 --> 34:11.258
--What old lady?

34:13.344 --> 34:14.804
What did you do?

34:14.887 --> 34:18.390
I didn't know she was in the house.
She wasn't supposed to be in the house.

34:19.016 --> 34:21.393
She started screaming.
I begged her to stop.

34:21.477 --> 34:23.187
What did you do?

34:23.270 --> 34:26.523
She saw my face.
I had no choice.

34:29.694 --> 34:33.530
Old lady left a husband.
Dead man, wife and kids.

34:33.615 --> 34:34.824
You gotta understand me.

34:34.907 --> 34:36.325
I had to do it.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.914
You still think this piece of shit
is worth saving?

34:43.374 --> 34:45.001
I'm not gonna shoot him.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.504
Yeah, okay.

34:51.591 --> 34:53.885
- I will...

34:53.968 --> 34:55.177
...if you don't kill me first.

35:05.813 --> 35:08.650
Not here.
And he's not uptown, either.

35:09.651 --> 35:10.693
Nothing in the morgues.

35:10.777 --> 35:13.487
Wherever our friend's spending the night,
it ain't in a hospital.

35:14.071 --> 35:16.741
Guess that's as good a news
as I'm gonna get.

35:16.824 --> 35:19.035
Hey, man, with friends like these...

35:21.871 --> 35:23.455
He's gonna be fine.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.292
I've seen him in action.

35:28.502 --> 35:29.503
I'm gonna go.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.005
Thanks.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.676
You know, you're good with people.

35:35.968 --> 35:38.554
-Yeah, I'm a real charmer.
-I'm serious.

35:38.638 --> 35:41.766
The only thing I ever saw stop
a thug mid-fight...

35:41.849 --> 35:43.559
- was a bigger thug.

35:43.643 --> 35:45.436
Yeah, I like to keep it thuggish.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.691
And our mutual friend?

35:51.483 --> 35:53.903
I wish things could've been
different between us.

35:55.905 --> 35:58.741
He's a very complicated man...

35:58.825 --> 35:59.951
and that, I don't need.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.748
But maybe this city needs him.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.752
And I know he needs you.

36:14.882 --> 36:16.718
Matt made a mistake when he let you go.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.262
What makes you think he did?

36:22.807 --> 36:25.226
-I'm losing patience, Red.
-Don't you dare shoot him.

36:25.309 --> 36:27.144
That's a bad idea.
You see, he'll kill again.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.688
Can't live with that, Red.
Can you?

36:28.771 --> 36:30.189
I'll leave the city.
I won't come back.

36:30.272 --> 36:32.024
Shut up. Shut up.
Take the shot.

36:32.108 --> 36:33.317
- Go to hell.
- Too late.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.526
Why are you doing this?

36:34.610 --> 36:37.529
'Cause you need to understand that pieces
of shit like this ruin people's lives.

36:37.613 --> 36:39.240
Killing him's not gonna
bring anybody back.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.617
No, but it will keep him
from hurting anybody else.

36:41.701 --> 36:42.785
No, I won't do it again, I swear.

36:42.869 --> 36:44.871
I'm gonna count down.

36:44.954 --> 36:46.538
-Five...
-Look, shoot him. Shoot him!

36:46.622 --> 36:47.664
-Four...
-Look, shoot.

36:47.749 --> 36:49.792
Hey, I'm gonna hand him over
to the police myself.

36:49.876 --> 36:52.128
I'm gonna make sure he pays
for what he's done, Frank.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.545
- Three...
- Shoot him! Do it!

36:53.629 --> 36:55.172
Take the shot, Red, take the shot.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.341
-No.
-You don't do it, his death's on you.

36:57.424 --> 36:58.675
Either way, you're a killer.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.386
-Two...
-What kind of choice is that?

37:00.469 --> 37:02.388
The kind I make every time
I pull the trigger.

37:02.471 --> 37:04.390
The kind I'm gonna make right now.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.081
Help me.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.293
Oh, God. I'm dying.

37:35.171 --> 37:36.672
-God, I'm dying.
-Stay still. Stay still.

37:36.756 --> 37:37.924
I'm gonna get you out of here.

37:38.007 --> 37:39.341
- I'm gonna get you out of here.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.761
I'm gonna get you out of here.

37:42.719 --> 37:45.097
No, put me down.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.947
Why didn't you stop him?

38:01.030 --> 38:02.656
I'm sorry.

38:17.129 --> 38:18.214
What the hell was that?

38:21.467 --> 38:23.385
--Come on, let's go!

38:24.929 --> 38:27.389
Everybody on me.
Come on!

38:42.571 --> 38:46.700
Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

39:19.233 --> 39:21.944
One batch, two batch.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.863
Penny and dime.

39:24.906 --> 39:26.240
-There he is.
-Come on!

39:43.174 --> 39:45.217
You're done, now, Red.

39:45.301 --> 39:46.843
They're coming for you.

39:46.928 --> 39:49.638
Only way you get out of this,
is if you grow wings.

40:45.111 --> 40:46.988
--Open the goddamn door! Now!

40:47.071 --> 40:48.322
Come on!

40:49.490 --> 40:51.700
- There he is!
- What the hell's going on?

40:51.783 --> 40:52.994
Shut up, old man.

40:57.414 --> 40:59.250
Drop the gun. Drop it!

41:00.584 --> 41:02.836
-You okay, sir?
-Yes.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.380
Get in your apartment.
Lock the door.

41:04.463 --> 41:05.965
What about you?

41:08.300 --> 41:09.718
I'm good.
