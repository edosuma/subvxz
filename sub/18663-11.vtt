00:30.560 --> 00:32.198

00:32.280 --> 00:34.078
They be moving way away
from the battle

00:34.160 --> 00:35.150

It's not exactly the most

It might get
a bit messy,

they can't.

to find him and I failed.

It took me a very long time to
understand that it wasn't my fault.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.639

telling you what you're telling me now?

always so proud of you.

He told me how the two of you used to
go free climbing in the Mariner Valley.

No belay. No back-up air.
No mech suits.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.520
Just you
and the elements.

He told me
about the accident.

what really happened?

- I just want to help.
- You were told what you needed to know,

06:34.960 --> 06:37.998
and you've helped
quite enough already.

It's time you stopped looking for
places to project your guilt.

is sit tight,

06:42.280 --> 06:43.953

06:44.240 --> 06:45.469

You lied to me
about Ganymede.

You all lied
about Travis.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.912
You've been lying to me
this whole time!

07:00.000 --> 07:01.150
That's what's
bothering you?

07:01.760 --> 07:03.558
That's what's
bothering you?

07:05.160 --> 07:07.880
You may have jeopardized
the future of Mars,

07:07.960 --> 07:10.680
but all you can think about
is your peace of mind.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.877
You, your whole generation,
you're soft.

07:12.960 --> 07:13.996
You're spoiled.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.919
I remember we had drill
raids in school every day

07:17.040 --> 07:19.316
because back then,
every Martian child knew

07:19.400 --> 07:22.279
that Earth's fleet was ready
and waiting to attack us.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.591
To destroy us.
To destroy everything

07:24.680 --> 07:26.831
that we had worked
so hard to build.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.070
And that's supposed
to justify...

07:28.160 --> 07:29.230
Grow up!

07:30.160 --> 07:34.791
Peace of mind is a luxury
that no Martian can afford,

07:34.880 --> 07:36.917
especially not a Marine.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.076
But you won't have to worry
about that much longer.

07:42.680 --> 07:43.875
What's that
supposed to mean?

07:44.040 --> 07:46.191
You won't be going back
to parade, Bobbie,

07:46.280 --> 07:47.839
because you don't
follow orders.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.560

09:05.320 --> 09:06.674
The atmosphere
above the impact site

09:06.760 --> 09:09.559
is far more corrosive than it should be,
and it's getting worse.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.314
Well, there's clearly something
else going on down there.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.877
Now, there's no way those structures
around that crater are natural formations.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.316
We have two probes left.

What if we cannibalize the shielding
from one to reinforce the other?

Lower orbit,
drop the probe from there,

09:25.480 --> 09:26.834
reduce the time of flight
to surface.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.235
I bet that
gets the job done.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.193
It would also break
mission protocols.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.239
Do you think if Magellan
followed protocols,

09:32.320 --> 09:33.674
he would have
circumnavigated the world?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.917
He didn't make it all the way around.
He died trying.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.600

His whole family's reeling under the
financial pressure we've put on them,

10:19.720 --> 10:22.872

Clarissa, is ready to crack.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.030
He adores her,

10:24.320 --> 10:26.357
and if we make an
amnesty offer through her,

10:26.760 --> 10:28.558
she may be able

13:10.840 --> 13:12.069

the notification?

13:12.160 --> 13:14.311
It came directly from Undersecretary

13:18.560 --> 13:20.313
Well, better safe

13:20.880 --> 13:22.997
I'm sure it'll all be
cleared up soon enough.

In the meantime,
return to your quarters.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.912

13:48.360 --> 13:49.840
Those are no use to me.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.720

show me the MCRN No-Fly Zone.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.635

13:56.760 --> 13:59.992
All right. So, no one goes in

14:01.120 --> 14:03.316

they're stranded down there.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.391

I got it. You're right.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.755

Gonna give up our location.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.435

the <i>Karakum's</i> flight plan?

14:59.120 --> 15:00.395
Huh.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.914
Well, that's a whole
lot of cryptic.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.229
What's their landing pattern?

15:03.600 --> 15:04.829
Where the hell
are they going to dock?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.838

15:10.560 --> 15:12.677
That smells like

Huh.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.510
You're right.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.759
They're probably here for the
exact same reason we are.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.991
Shit. That means I gotta get
down there before they do.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.992
(EXHALES) But if I
light up the engine,

15:28.080 --> 15:30.959
I may as well put a big freakin'

Not like this.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.115
This will
delay the transfer.

No, no.

It's a chrysalis.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.110
Mmm.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.071
A butterfly will squeeze
its way out of there soon.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.679
When I was a little boy,

18:02.560 --> 18:03.994
I was about your age,

18:04.600 --> 18:06.239
I saw one trying to get out.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.749
But it was having trouble,
so I tried to help.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.475
Really carefully,

18:13.920 --> 18:15.798
I split open the casing

18:16.760 --> 18:18.194
and the butterfly
came right out!

18:19.240 --> 18:20.560
But it couldn't fly.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.557
It was supposed
to struggle.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.190
Squeezing its way out
of that tight casing

18:27.280 --> 18:30.876
pushed fluid from its
fat body into its wings.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.518
Don't you want
to be able to fly one day?

18:40.760 --> 18:42.274
I'm scared.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.839
Well, let's play a game.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.832
We're explorers.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.352
And we're off
on a grand adventure.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.432
And that way
is the unknown.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.873
And, yeah,
there might be scary stuff,

19:00.320 --> 19:02.551
but there might
also be magical things

19:03.120 --> 19:04.679
like you've never imagined.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.075
And we may learn

the back-up plan.

there's enough diversity...

this station is fucked.

He's going to be very
disappointed in you.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.395
You should prepare for that.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.955
He told you that story?

21:44.440 --> 21:45.840
About the climbing accident?

21:46.200 --> 21:47.316
He was proud of you.

weren't that close, huh?

21:52.280 --> 21:53.396
Why would you say that?

tell you the real story.

that story to make me look good.
