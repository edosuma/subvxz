00:06.500 --> 00:08.320
<b>Together, there are five of you?</b>

00:08.610 --> 00:10.480
<b>Yeah, this is all of us.</b>

00:11.100 --> 00:13.370
<b>There are two others in my group.</b>

00:15.660 --> 00:17.980
<b>This only gives us a total of nine.</b>

00:17.980 --> 00:19.370
<b>Where do you plan to find the rest?</b>

00:19.840 --> 00:22.520
<b>We'll need fifteen members, right?</b>

00:23.060 --> 00:25.120
<b>We can use stand-ins for the remaining six.</b>

00:25.510 --> 00:28.880
<b>Invite players who want to return 
to the real world but can't.</b>

00:29.310 --> 00:31.140
<b>They won't be able to help,</b>

00:31.140 --> 00:33.380
<b>but they won't care about 
receiving cards, either.</b>

00:34.800 --> 00:38.770
<b>Meaning that the nine of us will 
have to win the contest.</b>

00:39.600 --> 00:41.950
<b>I don't know how strong our 
opponents are, but can we?</b>

00:42.460 --> 00:43.390
<b>We can.</b>

00:43.390 --> 00:45.620
<b>Even if we can't manage eight wins,</b>

00:45.620 --> 00:48.090
<b>we're allowed to switch members and try again.</b>

00:48.410 --> 00:51.400
<b>So whether we can win depends on you guys.</b>

00:52.310 --> 00:53.900
<b>Show us your <i>Ren</i>.</b>

00:54.430 --> 00:57.580
<b>We'll decide if we want you afterwards.</b>

02:17.990 --> 02:23.030
<b>A x Heated x Showdown</b>

02:24.340 --> 02:27.310
<b>I see our roles have been reversed.</b>

02:27.310 --> 02:28.580
<b>Very well.</b>

02:28.880 --> 02:29.980
<b>Here I go!</b>

02:37.330 --> 02:38.550
<b>Awesome!</b>

02:40.740 --> 02:43.050
<b>If I use my full strength, I can fly higher.</b>

02:43.780 --> 02:48.060
<b>My record is sixteen meters, 
eighty centimeters.</b>

02:49.940 --> 02:50.960
<b>Ready, and...</b>

02:53.540 --> 02:56.690
<b><i>They shattered my record with ease.</i></b>

02:56.960 --> 02:58.780
<b>Ha ha, I win.</b>

02:57.590 --> 03:00.700
<b><i>How much have they improved 
in such a short period of time?</i></b>

02:58.780 --> 02:59.870
<b>Darn!</b>

03:01.840 --> 03:02.960
<b>I am impressed.</b>

03:03.410 --> 03:06.240
<b>Although you still fall a bit 
short of my full height.</b>

03:07.430 --> 03:09.330
<b>Okay! Let's go again!</b>

03:09.700 --> 03:10.760
<b>No way.</b>

03:10.760 --> 03:12.400
<b>You won't stop until you win.</b>

03:12.400 --> 03:14.410
<b>One more time... Just once more!</b>

03:14.410 --> 03:16.640
<b>Oh, you passed.</b>

03:16.640 --> 03:17.590
<b>Nice jump.</b>

03:18.240 --> 03:19.450
<b>Sorry...</b>

03:18.710 --> 03:20.410
<b>Once more!</b>

03:19.450 --> 03:21.590
<b>They're only kids, so let it slide.</b>

03:20.410 --> 03:21.590
<b>Fine.</b>

03:22.320 --> 03:24.500
<b>We believe that you guys are strong.</b>

03:25.040 --> 03:29.620
<b>But it comes down to figuring out 
who to assign to which sport.</b>

03:27.210 --> 03:28.590
<b>Killua, once more!</b>

03:28.590 --> 03:30.150
<b>See, I knew it...</b>

03:30.150 --> 03:33.350
<b>No more. I win!</b>

03:30.150 --> 03:33.350
<b>Do we know all the sports they'll use?</b>

03:34.160 --> 03:36.360
<b>We've managed to confirm these eight.</b>

03:34.380 --> 03:41.860
<b>Beach Volleyball 
Wrestling 
Boxing 
Juggling 
Free Throws 
Sumo 
Bowling 
Ping Pong</b>

03:37.070 --> 03:41.860
<b>Depending on our success, 
they may add additional sports.</b>

03:42.310 --> 03:43.280
<b>I understand...</b>

03:43.870 --> 03:45.120
<b>Hey, this is bad!</b>

03:45.930 --> 03:46.880
<b>What is it?</b>

03:47.290 --> 03:49.620
<b>Team Genthru is up to ninety-seven cards.</b>

03:52.010 --> 03:53.870
<b><i>Then they're only missing...</i></b>

03:54.400 --> 03:57.560
<b><i>Patch of Shore and Lucky Alexandrite!</i></b>

04:01.610 --> 04:04.600
<b>Over the past week, we've run various simulations</b>

04:04.600 --> 04:06.140
<b>and have prepared accordingly.</b>

04:06.440 --> 04:08.770
<b>Given Team Genthru's current situation,</b>

04:08.770 --> 04:10.890
<b>we can't afford to lose.</b>

04:11.340 --> 04:12.800
<b>We have to win!</b>

04:12.800 --> 04:14.400
<b>Yes, we'll win.</b>

04:16.980 --> 04:18.900
<b><i>This isn't too bad...</i></b>

04:20.900 --> 04:22.080
<b>Okay, let's go.</b>

04:28.760 --> 04:30.660
<b>We'll begin with boxing.</b>

04:32.940 --> 04:34.780
<b>I'll send you packing.</b>

04:35.620 --> 04:37.790
<b>His special ability is teleportation.</b>

04:40.980 --> 04:44.050
<b>He can teleport his uppercut.</b>

04:44.870 --> 04:45.550
<b>Fight!</b>

04:47.520 --> 04:48.850
<b><i>H-He's fast!</i></b>

04:49.210 --> 04:50.100
<b><i>An infighter?</i></b>

04:51.700 --> 04:54.850
<b><i>If I'm close enough, his Emitter 
advantages are worthless.</i></b>

04:55.080 --> 04:56.910
<b><i>He'll be so busy guarding,</i></b>

04:56.910 --> 04:59.360
<b><i>he won't have a chance to use teleportation!</i></b>

05:01.920 --> 05:02.780
<b>Nice!</b>

05:03.720 --> 05:05.800
<b><i>The pattern depicted on the ring</i></b>

05:05.800 --> 05:08.660
<b><i>is a sacred symbol that boosts </i>Nen.</b>

05:09.110 --> 05:12.120
<b><i>Suggesting that he can only teleport</i></b>

05:12.120 --> 05:14.040
<b><i>while standing within the ring.</i></b>

05:14.040 --> 05:19.540
<b><i>Essentially, he's revealing that 
he isn't all that strong.</i></b>

05:20.060 --> 05:21.740
<b><i>An opponent unworthy of us.</i></b>

05:24.730 --> 05:26.300
<b>The winner is Barry!</b>

05:26.610 --> 05:27.650
<b>Yes!</b>

05:32.310 --> 05:34.170
<b>The winner is Rodriot!</b>

05:37.140 --> 05:38.380
<b>The winner is Kess!</b>

05:39.640 --> 05:40.480
<b>Yes!</b>

05:40.930 --> 05:42.330
<b>That's three wins!</b>

05:44.240 --> 05:45.740
<b><i>In terms of combat strength,</i></b>

05:46.520 --> 05:49.020
<b><i>those six are very strong.</i></b>

05:49.320 --> 05:51.040
<b><i>This is getting interesting...</i></b>

05:53.840 --> 05:56.250
<b>You guys can toss your matches.</b>

05:56.940 --> 05:58.500
<b>I'll take it from here.</b>

05:59.970 --> 06:01.040
<b>Roger that.</b>

06:01.040 --> 06:02.250
<b>Wait!</b>

06:03.110 --> 06:05.610
<b>I'm done following your orders.</b>

06:05.850 --> 06:08.260
<b>I'll be doing things my own way now.</b>

06:09.660 --> 06:11.890
<b>Hey, brat! Let's step outside!</b>

06:12.430 --> 06:15.020
<b>Outside? Do you think this is a sumo ring?</b>

06:15.430 --> 06:17.090
<b>I'm done playing around.</b>

06:17.090 --> 06:19.350
<b>Want me to kill you here?</b>

06:19.350 --> 06:20.560
<b>Hey, Bobobo!</b>

06:20.870 --> 06:23.360
<b>That's a violation of our agreement.</b>

06:23.360 --> 06:25.780
<b>Want to go back to the slammer, Bobobo?</b>

06:26.080 --> 06:27.600
<b>I don't give a damn!</b>

06:27.600 --> 06:30.190
<b>I'm done playing this stupid game!</b>

06:31.150 --> 06:33.380
<b>Anyone else with me?</b>

06:33.380 --> 06:35.910
<b>If we team up, we can crush that bastard.</b>

06:36.450 --> 06:40.170
<b>And then we can use a ship 
to get off this island!</b>

06:49.950 --> 06:52.320
<b>You'll be punished for breaking the taboo.</b>

06:52.920 --> 06:54.560
<b>Didn't I warn you?</b>

06:55.350 --> 06:57.210
<b>Y-Yes, you did...</b>

06:58.110 --> 07:01.970
<b>Did that idiot think I wouldn't kill him?</b>

07:04.690 --> 07:06.820
<b>Okay, I'll go next.</b>

07:07.360 --> 07:09.320
<b>Hey, this looks bad.</b>

07:09.610 --> 07:12.010
<b>We can't fight those guys...</b>

07:12.010 --> 07:13.370
<b>No, hold on.</b>

07:13.370 --> 07:15.150
<b>We'll be doing the fighting.</b>

07:15.480 --> 07:16.850
<b>We explained how this works.</b>

07:17.360 --> 07:20.040
<b>If the nine of us cannot secure eight victories,</b>

07:20.040 --> 07:22.990
<b>you can just forfeit without fighting.</b>

07:23.530 --> 07:24.830
<b>Really?</b>

07:24.830 --> 07:26.670
<b>You guarantee we won't have to fight?</b>

07:26.670 --> 07:28.340
<b>Yeah, don't worry.</b>

07:30.300 --> 07:34.320
<b><i>That guy has a much stronger aura than the rest.</i></b>

07:34.850 --> 07:36.570
<b><i>And judging by the previous conversation,</i></b>

07:37.050 --> 07:40.160
<b><i>he must be a Game Master.</i></b>

07:41.560 --> 07:42.650
<b>Can I ask something?</b>

07:43.000 --> 07:44.570
<b>That guy's dead.</b>

07:44.570 --> 07:46.350
<b>What about the sumo match?</b>

07:46.350 --> 07:49.840
<b>Hmm? Oh, you get the win.</b>

07:49.840 --> 07:54.030
<b>But we never decided who we were sending.</b>

07:54.740 --> 07:58.040
<b><i>You're the one who said you 
were going to do the sumo.</i></b>

07:58.310 --> 08:00.580
<b>I don't care who you give the win to.</b>

08:01.010 --> 08:04.110
<b>Just give it to one of the guys 
standing in the back.</b>

08:04.110 --> 08:07.310
<b>Okay, you get the sumo win.</b>

08:07.310 --> 08:09.050
<b>Eh? Wait, me?</b>

08:09.720 --> 08:11.620
<b>That gives us four wins.</b>

08:13.280 --> 08:14.550
<b>Now, then...</b>

08:14.550 --> 08:17.050
<b>I'll go with an eight-on-eight game</b>

08:17.880 --> 08:19.200
<b>of dodgeball.</b>

08:27.490 --> 08:29.570
<b>Pick the eight members you'll field.</b>

08:32.460 --> 08:34.620
<b>I already have mine.</b>

08:35.400 --> 08:36.690
<b>Hold on...</b>

08:36.690 --> 08:38.030
<b>How is this scored?</b>

08:38.760 --> 08:40.690
<b>It's one win per person, right?</b>

08:40.690 --> 08:42.580
<b>Yes, one win per person.</b>

08:43.120 --> 08:45.580
<b>So the victorious team receives eight wins.</b>

08:45.860 --> 08:47.230
<b>Simple enough, yes?</b>

08:47.230 --> 08:48.890
<b>So that was the plan?</b>

08:49.610 --> 08:52.160
<b><i>No matter how many of his weaker members</i></b>

08:52.160 --> 08:55.340
<b><i>we defeat, he can still win 
the entire game alone.</i></b>

08:56.360 --> 08:58.390
<b><i>Razor and the fourteen devils...</i></b>

08:58.760 --> 09:01.850
<b><i>The devils are his</i> Nen <i>ability!</i></b>

09:02.590 --> 09:04.000
<b>I'm against this...</b>

09:04.000 --> 09:06.480
<b>If we have to field eight, you need two more!</b>

09:06.770 --> 09:09.360
<b>I'm not fighting that guy!</b>

09:09.910 --> 09:11.730
<b>I'm leaving now...</b>

09:12.140 --> 09:13.760
<b>Once the match begins,</b>

09:13.760 --> 09:15.410
<b>you can deliberately let yourself be hit—</b>

09:15.410 --> 09:16.810
<b>Screw that!</b>

09:16.810 --> 09:18.210
<b>Didn't you see that?</b>

09:18.210 --> 09:20.620
<b>If he hits us with that ball, we're dead!</b>

09:20.620 --> 09:25.110
<b>Oh, just so everything is clear, 
we'll be using a normal ball.</b>

09:25.110 --> 09:29.130
<b>But with <i>Nen</i>, it's just as strong as 
the <i>Nen</i> projectile I launched earlier.</b>

09:29.650 --> 09:31.660
<b>This is crazy... I'm outta here!</b>

09:31.660 --> 09:34.130
<b>Sorry, but I don't want to die yet...</b>

09:34.130 --> 09:36.140
<b>H-Hold on!</b>

09:36.140 --> 09:37.890
<b>We'll think of something real quick.</b>

09:39.280 --> 09:40.630
<b><i>This is very bad.</i></b>

09:40.630 --> 09:42.830
<b><i>We only have six players of any use.</i></b>

09:42.830 --> 09:46.810
<b><i>So we're forced to pick two 
of these spineless wimps.</i></b>

09:47.770 --> 09:49.400
<b>We'll do this by ourselves.</b>

09:50.720 --> 09:52.160
<b>If our lives are on the line,</b>

09:52.160 --> 09:54.050
<b>we should only field willing players.</b>

09:54.050 --> 09:56.400
<b>Do you have a problem if we only field six?</b>

09:56.670 --> 09:59.680
<b>Yes, actually, I can't let you do that...</b>

09:59.680 --> 10:03.800
<b>You will have to field eight members.</b>

10:03.800 --> 10:07.040
<b>Otherwise, why ask you to recruit fifteen?</b>

10:14.550 --> 10:17.630
<b>Saying this to an in-game character 
is probably pointless,</b>

10:17.990 --> 10:21.100
<b>but wasn't Bobobo one of your allies?</b>

10:21.100 --> 10:24.390
<b>What did he do to deserve death?</b>

10:24.630 --> 10:27.480
<b>Burglary-murder and rape-murder.</b>

10:27.480 --> 10:30.150
<b>Eleven confirmed counts alone.</b>

10:31.390 --> 10:33.770
<b>This is the real world.</b>

10:34.930 --> 10:39.030
<b>This place, Greed Island, is located 
somewhere in the real world.</b>

10:39.540 --> 10:42.030
<b>This game takes place in the real world.</b>

10:44.280 --> 10:50.330
<b>Revealing that information to a player who 
believes they're inside a game is a taboo.</b>

10:50.830 --> 10:53.540
<b>Bobobo was executed for breaking that taboo.</b>

10:53.940 --> 10:56.720
<b>This guy, Razor, is a Game Master,</b>

10:56.720 --> 10:58.350
<b>a real human.</b>

10:58.820 --> 11:00.050
<b>Game Master?</b>

11:00.420 --> 11:03.210
<b>One of the people who made this game.</b>

11:03.880 --> 11:04.660
<b>Huh?</b>

11:04.960 --> 11:06.560
<b>Wait, then...</b>

11:06.900 --> 11:10.220
<b>Bobobo and the other pirates 
are real death row criminals.</b>

11:10.670 --> 11:14.750
<b>Not only did he disobey orders; 
he attempted to instigate an escape.</b>

11:15.230 --> 11:17.070
<b>Execution was a fair consequence.</b>

11:17.510 --> 11:20.020
<b>This is the real world?</b>

11:20.020 --> 11:21.820
<b>That is correct.</b>

11:22.310 --> 11:23.590
<b>I never noticed.</b>

11:23.590 --> 11:26.080
<b>I hadn't even considered that.</b>

11:28.050 --> 11:31.010
<b>Well, it doesn't really matter.</b>

11:31.480 --> 11:34.770
<b>Since this island is still isolated 
from the rest of the world.</b>

11:35.430 --> 11:36.710
<b>Wait a second.</b>

11:36.710 --> 11:39.340
<b>If this is the real world,</b>

11:39.340 --> 11:41.340
<b>does that mean that Ging is here,</b>

11:42.100 --> 11:43.720
<b>on Greed Island?</b>

11:43.720 --> 11:44.740
<b>Ging?</b>

11:44.740 --> 11:46.050
<b>Ah...</b>

11:46.470 --> 11:48.430
<b>So you must be Gon.</b>

11:48.430 --> 11:49.490
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:51.260 --> 11:54.940
<b>I was instructed not to go easy on you</b>

11:56.120 --> 11:57.980
<b>by your old man.</b>

12:06.630 --> 12:08.160
<b>I've had enough...</b>

12:08.160 --> 12:09.560
<b>I don't wanna die!</b>

12:09.560 --> 12:11.790
<b>Count me out! I'm gone!</b>

12:12.860 --> 12:14.250
<b>H-Hey!</b>

12:14.540 --> 12:16.210
<b>It's okay, let them leave.</b>

12:16.210 --> 12:18.000
<b>But then we can't have a match!</b>

12:18.250 --> 12:20.510
<b>I'll count as three.</b>

12:24.450 --> 12:26.320
<b>You're doing the same thing,</b>

12:26.320 --> 12:27.870
<b>so it shouldn't be a problem.</b>

12:27.870 --> 12:29.520
<b>Yeah, that's fine.</b>

12:30.250 --> 12:32.180
<b>Now it's eight-on-eight.</b>

12:36.240 --> 12:38.020
<b>I'll explain the rules.</b>

12:38.770 --> 12:41.620
<b>The game starts with one outside 
player and seven inside.</b>

12:42.240 --> 12:44.730
<b>The first team to run out of inside players loses.</b>

12:44.730 --> 12:48.030
<b>Any player inside the court who's hit by 
a ball thrown by an opponent is out,</b>

12:48.030 --> 12:49.350
<b>and must move outside.</b>

12:49.350 --> 12:50.040
<b>However,</b>

12:50.370 --> 12:54.530
<b>you may bring one player inside 
the court again by saying "Back."</b>

12:55.290 --> 12:59.290
<b>And if the ball hits an area outside 
the court, without any players,</b>

12:59.290 --> 13:02.810
<b>the opposing team gets the ball.</b>

13:02.810 --> 13:04.930
<b>Now, the important stuff...</b>

13:06.080 --> 13:09.560
<b>The rules regarding hits 
employ a cushion effect.</b>

13:09.850 --> 13:14.100
<b>For example, if I throw the ball 
and it hits opposing player A, ricochets,</b>

13:14.100 --> 13:17.680
<b>and hits opposing player B 
before hitting the floor,</b>

13:17.680 --> 13:19.570
<b>both A and B are out.</b>

13:19.920 --> 13:23.470
<b>But if player B in that scenario 
is able to catch the ball,</b>

13:23.470 --> 13:24.700
<b>player A is safe.</b>

13:24.700 --> 13:25.810
<b>Exactly.</b>

13:26.230 --> 13:30.270
<b>But if I throw the ball and it 
hits opposing player A, ricochets,</b>

13:30.270 --> 13:35.180
<b>and hits my teammate, player C, 
before hitting the floor,</b>

13:35.180 --> 13:37.830
<b>only player C is out.</b>

13:38.330 --> 13:43.590
<b>Then if player C catches the ball, 
does that mean player A is out?</b>

13:44.010 --> 13:45.220
<b>Indeed.</b>

13:45.220 --> 13:47.010
<b>Uh...</b>

13:47.370 --> 13:48.570
<b>Do you have a question?</b>

13:48.900 --> 13:51.390
<b>If an outside player hits someone 
with the ball, is the hit player out?</b>

13:51.390 --> 13:53.100
<b>Naturally, they're out.</b>

13:53.100 --> 13:55.320
<b>But only one player</b>

13:55.320 --> 13:58.190
<b>can return to the court using Back.</b>

14:00.620 --> 14:03.090
<b>I am Number 0, the ref.</b>

14:03.090 --> 14:03.980
<b>Let's have a clean game.</b>

14:04.530 --> 14:07.170
<b>We will now begin the game.</b>

14:09.650 --> 14:10.990
<b>Ready...</b>

14:13.720 --> 14:14.870
<b>Go!</b>

14:17.330 --> 14:19.250
<b>You can make the first move.</b>

14:21.970 --> 14:23.650
<b>You sound quite confident.</b>

14:24.020 --> 14:27.470
<b>Here's a little greeting, then!</b>

14:32.650 --> 14:33.400
<b>You got him!</b>

14:33.970 --> 14:35.890
<b>Yes! That's one down!</b>

14:38.500 --> 14:39.400
<b>Good!</b>

14:40.090 --> 14:41.150
<b>Let's keep this up.</b>

14:41.410 --> 14:42.400
<b>There!</b>

14:44.780 --> 14:46.780
<b>Okay, that's two down!</b>

14:47.150 --> 14:48.870
<b>Oh, this is easy.</b>

14:50.060 --> 14:52.030
<b>Okay, all ready to go...</b>

14:52.360 --> 14:54.030
<b>Huh? What did you say?</b>

14:54.350 --> 14:57.540
<b>I'm prepared to defeat you now.</b>

14:57.540 --> 14:59.540
<b>Heh, that's funny.</b>

15:02.090 --> 15:04.550
<b>Show us what you've got!</b>

15:11.450 --> 15:13.550
<b><i>H-He stopped it with one hand?</i></b>

15:13.840 --> 15:14.990
<b>Right, then...</b>

15:14.990 --> 15:16.770
<b>Time to launch the counterattack.</b>

15:18.730 --> 15:20.320
<b><i>He's standing so far back...</i></b>

15:20.910 --> 15:21.780
<b><i>Is he going to pass it?</i></b>

15:27.870 --> 15:28.570
<b><i>Fast!</i></b>

15:29.240 --> 15:30.420
<b><i>Can I dodge it?</i></b>

15:30.420 --> 15:31.320
<b><i>No way!</i></b>

15:31.700 --> 15:33.570
<b><i>Can I catch it and live?</i></b>

15:34.130 --> 15:35.080
<b><i>No!</i></b>

15:35.080 --> 15:36.120
<b><i>I'll die!</i></b>

15:36.120 --> 15:37.080
<b>Death</b>

15:37.270 --> 15:39.080
<b><i>White Goreinu!</i></b>

15:47.310 --> 15:48.840
<b>Nice rebound.</b>

15:54.060 --> 15:55.600
<b>Goreinu's outside the court!</b>

15:55.870 --> 15:57.290
<b>I see...</b>

15:57.290 --> 16:01.110
<b>You have the ability to change 
places with your <i>Nen</i> beasts.</b>

16:03.410 --> 16:06.090
<b><i>The </i>Nen <i>creature was shattered...</i></b>

16:06.090 --> 16:11.240
<b><i>This reflects what Goreinu imagined would 
happen when he saw Razor's attack.</i></b>

16:11.940 --> 16:15.730
<b><i>He immediately grasped the gap between 
our opponent's strength and his own.</i></b>

16:16.190 --> 16:19.450
<b><i>He won't easily rid himself of that image.</i></b>

16:19.860 --> 16:23.120
<b><i>It'll be impossible for him to 
recover during this match.</i></b>

16:24.060 --> 16:26.130
<b><i>He's done.</i></b>

16:27.000 --> 16:30.660
<b>Goreinu's <i>Nen</i> beast is the one that's out, right?</b>

16:30.660 --> 16:34.640
<b>Yes, the exchange was performed 
with <i>Nen</i>, so it broke no rules.</b>

16:34.640 --> 16:39.620
<b>However, Back must be used to 
bring Goreinu inside the court.</b>

16:40.900 --> 16:43.730
<b><i>Damn... Is this how it ends?</i></b>

16:44.800 --> 16:46.460
<b>All right, let's move on!</b>

16:48.100 --> 16:49.690
<b><i>That pass is so fast!</i></b>

16:53.550 --> 16:55.200
<b><i>I-It's too fast...</i></b>

16:56.110 --> 16:58.580
<b><i>I can't follow the ball!</i></b>

17:00.350 --> 17:01.230
<b>Tsezgerra!</b>

17:01.230 --> 17:01.950
<b>Behind you!</b>

17:13.370 --> 17:14.510
<b><i>It's heavy...</i></b>

17:14.510 --> 17:16.620
<b><i>As heavy as a bowling ball.</i></b>

17:17.090 --> 17:18.990
<b><i>This is gonna have insane power.</i></b>

17:20.370 --> 17:25.290
<b>He focused his aura in his back, 
and avoided a lethal blow.</b>

17:26.020 --> 17:28.230
<b>Hey, patch him up.</b>

17:28.860 --> 17:31.670
<b>I-I'm fine... Don't touch me.</b>

17:32.090 --> 17:36.740
<b>If a player is unable to continue 
playing, they're disqualified.</b>

17:37.140 --> 17:38.720
<b>They won't be allowed</b>

17:38.720 --> 17:41.240
<b>to play in or outside the court, 
so keep that in mind.</b>

17:43.250 --> 17:44.480
<b>Are you okay?</b>

17:44.480 --> 17:47.500
<b>Yeah, I've really lost it...</b>

17:47.890 --> 17:51.160
<b><i>Damn, in overall combat ability,</i></b>

17:51.160 --> 17:53.390
<b><i>I should still be stronger than they are.</i></b>

17:53.390 --> 17:58.510
<b><i>But when it comes to the basics like 
agility and reflexes, they have me beat.</i></b>

18:02.780 --> 18:06.530
<b><i>It's been a while since I've 
had to work really hard.</i></b>

18:07.170 --> 18:09.520
<b><i>Maybe it's time to start training from scratch.</i></b>

18:10.940 --> 18:15.030
<b><i>I don't think I've done any basic 
training in the past few years.</i></b>

18:16.830 --> 18:19.800
<b><i>Ideally, we could knock out 
everyone on the other team</i></b>

18:19.800 --> 18:22.030
<b><i>without giving up the ball.</i></b>

18:22.030 --> 18:22.990
<b>Hisoka...</b>

18:22.990 --> 18:25.540
<b>Okay, give me the ball.</b>

18:26.370 --> 18:27.540
<b><i>Oh, that's right.</i></b>

18:28.340 --> 18:33.030
<b><i>If he uses his Bungee Gum, he can 
retrieve the ball after it hits!</i></b>

18:35.070 --> 18:38.000
<b>Now, do try to entertain me.</b>

18:38.000 --> 18:40.300
<b>Surely this isn't everything you have.</b>

18:41.590 --> 18:42.810
<b>Very well...</b>

18:43.080 --> 18:45.310
<b>Okay, that's three down!</b>

18:45.580 --> 18:47.810
<b>With Back, the other team still has five players!</b>

18:48.340 --> 18:51.350
<b><i>With Bungee Gum, we can stay on the offensive.</i></b>

18:51.350 --> 18:53.010
<b><i>All that's left is the order we target them.</i></b>

18:53.580 --> 18:54.880
<b>Question for the ref.</b>

18:54.880 --> 18:57.880
<b>Can the last player inside the court</b>

18:57.880 --> 19:00.070
<b>use Back at the second he's hit?</b>

19:00.570 --> 19:01.780
<b>That's not allowed.</b>

19:01.780 --> 19:04.130
<b>For a moment, there would 
be zero players in the court,</b>

19:04.130 --> 19:06.080
<b>so that team would lose.</b>

19:06.080 --> 19:10.080
<b>But someone outside the court may use Back</b>

19:10.080 --> 19:14.070
<b>at the instant that the last player is hit.</b>

19:14.670 --> 19:15.590
<b>Okay.</b>

19:16.070 --> 19:16.920
<b>Hisoka...</b>

19:16.920 --> 19:18.590
<b>Yes, I understand.</b>

19:19.120 --> 19:20.840
<b>We leave him for last.</b>

19:21.800 --> 19:24.100
<b><i>He throws a strong ball.</i></b>

19:24.530 --> 19:27.850
<b><i>Numbers 2, 6, and 7 can't catch it.</i></b>

19:31.280 --> 19:32.940
<b>Nice and strong!</b>

19:32.940 --> 19:36.820
<b>If we're lucky, we can take out 
6 and 7 at the same time!</b>

19:41.640 --> 19:43.270
<b>Th-They combined?</b>

19:48.550 --> 19:49.760
<b>You're strong.</b>

19:51.040 --> 19:52.360
<b>Is that allowed?!</b>

19:52.360 --> 19:53.390
<b>It is.</b>

19:53.390 --> 19:56.120
<b>If you're allowed to combine, 
are you allowed to split?</b>

19:56.120 --> 20:00.150
<b>Yes, but you cannot surpass the maximum 
number of players on the court.</b>

20:00.760 --> 20:02.260
<b>Now!</b>

20:02.790 --> 20:04.760
<b>It's my turn to attack again.</b>

20:05.910 --> 20:09.120
<b><i>Now we have to retake the ball again.</i></b>

20:09.600 --> 20:11.390
<b><i>If we're going to stop his ball...</i></b>

20:11.830 --> 20:12.480
<b><i>Ken!</i></b>

20:17.560 --> 20:20.790
<b><i>Their </i>Nen <i>is smooth and quite beautiful.</i></b>

20:21.280 --> 20:23.100
<b><i>They must have trained hard.</i></b>

20:23.100 --> 20:26.040
<b><i>But if Razor throws the ball at full strength,</i></b>

20:26.040 --> 20:28.670
<b>Ken <i>won't be enough.</i></b>

20:28.670 --> 20:31.090
<b><i>They must be prepared for casualties 
when they recover the ball</i></b>

20:31.090 --> 20:32.540
<b><i>and try to defeat him.</i></b>

20:32.540 --> 20:34.820
<b><i>Is it even possible?</i></b>

20:36.360 --> 20:38.210
<b>So you know how to use <i>Ken</i>.</b>

20:38.210 --> 20:39.940
<b>That means you won't die.</b>

20:40.420 --> 20:41.550
<b>However...</b>

20:41.800 --> 20:44.200
<b>That assumes you aren't hit in the wrong spot.</b>

20:45.420 --> 20:46.510
<b>Here I come,</b>

20:47.310 --> 20:48.310
<b>Gon!</b>

20:51.620 --> 20:52.560
<b>Bring it!</b>

20:58.320 --> 20:59.800
<b><i>It won't work! Run away!</i></b>

21:00.310 --> 21:01.340
<b><i>You'll die!</i></b>

21:07.960 --> 21:08.720
<b><i>Ko!</i></b>

21:17.460 --> 21:18.220
<b>Gon!</b>

21:19.530 --> 21:20.540
<b>Where's the ball?</b>

21:21.610 --> 21:22.860
<b>Crazy...</b>

21:22.860 --> 21:24.840
<b>It's drilled in there.</b>

21:25.420 --> 21:26.160
<b>Gon!</b>

21:26.160 --> 21:27.340
<b>Are you okay?!</b>

21:28.020 --> 21:29.650
<b>I'm just fine!</b>

21:29.650 --> 21:30.850
<b>The hell you are...</b>

21:31.330 --> 21:33.820
<b>I used <i>Ko</i> to harden my arms and head,</b>

21:33.820 --> 21:36.100
<b>but my legs couldn't take the impact.</b>

21:37.000 --> 21:37.830
<b>However,</b>

21:38.750 --> 21:39.690
<b>next time,</b>

21:40.290 --> 21:41.110
<b>I'll catch it!</b>

21:47.520 --> 21:50.450
<b>Gon is now fired up.</b>

23:01.110 --> 23:08.430
<b>G.I. Tutorial</b>

23:01.710 --> 23:04.860
<b>Coming up, it's the 
Greed Island Tutorial!</b>

23:07.270 --> 23:09.580
<b>Today, we introduce the card Accompany.</b>

23:08.430 --> 23:18.750
<b>Accompany 

Warp all players within 20 meters 
of caster to city (must have been visited) 
or player of your choice (must have 
been met inside the game). 

[SR][NORM]</b>

23:09.580 --> 23:13.170
<b>It lets you warp everyone within 20 meters.</b>

23:13.170 --> 23:16.100
<b>What if a player is 21 meters large?</b>

23:18.910 --> 23:20.920
<b>Continue!</b>

23:25.480 --> 23:27.660
<b>Next time: Guts x And x Courage.</b>

23:27.950 --> 23:28.960
<b>Receive!</b>

23:28.960 --> 23:29.630
<b>Toss!</b>

23:29.630 --> 23:30.720
<b>Attack!</b>

23:30.720 --> 23:32.760
<b>But we're using aura...</b>

23:32.760 --> 23:34.310
<b>Because we're Hunters!</b>
