00:29.679 --> 00:31.271
Hey.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.046
Bye!

00:41.725 --> 00:44.057
Bouquet? Bouquet.

00:44.227 --> 00:45.216
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:46.629 --> 00:48.290
But let me tell you the truth.

00:48.798 --> 00:53.167
For a lot of people, marriage is like
sticking your tongue on a frozen flagpole.

00:53.336 --> 00:56.100
It looks like fun when you see
friends doing it, so you say:

00:56.272 --> 00:59.139
"Hey, I'll give it a try.
Just once."

00:59.309 --> 01:02.540
Next thing you know, you're stuck.

01:02.712 --> 01:04.179
Full of regret.

01:04.346 --> 01:06.838
Praying, "Please get me
out of this with my dignity...

01:07.016 --> 01:09.985
...if least not my extremities, intact."

01:10.153 --> 01:12.348
But it doesn't have to be
like that, my friends.

01:12.522 --> 01:15.650
It does not have to be like that.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.383
That's where I come in.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.028
Good marriages are my business.

01:20.396 --> 01:22.387
<i>Meeting the right person</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

01:22.564 --> 01:25.329
<i>Well, my friends, 
that is up to you.</i>

01:25.502 --> 01:26.969
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:27.137 --> 01:30.265
- I'll go.
- Yeah, you go. Okay.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.214
- Hi. I'm Sadie.
- Hi. Ben.

01:49.392 --> 01:51.622
<i>From that first, destined meeting...</i>

01:52.162 --> 01:55.188
<i>... to the sweet innocence</i>
<i>of the first date.</i>

02:00.136 --> 02:02.468
- Are you skipping to second base?
- What's that? No.

02:02.639 --> 02:04.368
You know why? I'm not a skipper.

02:04.541 --> 02:09.478
Maybe we should take care of first base,
just to make things right.

02:12.148 --> 02:14.241
<i>The first kiss.</i>

02:14.918 --> 02:17.386
<i>The first time you say "I love you."</i>

02:17.554 --> 02:19.283
- I love you.
- What?

02:19.455 --> 02:22.083
What? A view.
What a view.

02:22.258 --> 02:25.819
<i>First time you say "I love you,"</i>
<i>and she actually hears you.</i>

02:25.995 --> 02:27.485
I love you.

02:29.098 --> 02:32.226
- I'm afraid you're not my type.
- I love you too.

02:39.008 --> 02:41.568
You seriously didn't think I was
gonna let you see that?

02:42.445 --> 02:45.107
<i>Let's skip to the next thing:</i>
<i>moving in together.</i>

02:45.281 --> 02:49.240
<i>The first time she finds something</i>
<i>you don't want her to see.</i>

02:50.320 --> 02:53.551
- Don't worry, I got the heavy ones.
- "Dear Mr. Brian Boitano."

02:53.723 --> 02:56.453
- Oh, God!
- "Congratulations on your triple Axel.

02:56.993 --> 02:58.984
I wonder how much
you practice every week...

02:59.162 --> 03:02.996
...and also how you make your hair
stay like that."

03:03.166 --> 03:05.600
Hey, he was a legend. Okay?

03:05.768 --> 03:08.601
I mean, even at age 9 I knew that.

03:09.005 --> 03:11.838
I'm gonna get a less embarrassing box.
Okay.

03:12.008 --> 03:14.442
<i>If she doesn't dump your</i>
<i>wussy ass after that...</i>

03:15.645 --> 03:18.205
...then comes the big one: the proposal.

03:29.058 --> 03:30.218
Sadie...

03:30.393 --> 03:31.985
...you're a great girl. You are.

03:32.161 --> 03:34.527
And I think it's time that
you and I were man and...

03:34.697 --> 03:36.688
Lame. That is so lame.

03:40.837 --> 03:44.204
We are so pleased all of you
could be here with us today...

03:44.374 --> 03:48.606
...to celebrate our 30 years of marriage.

03:48.778 --> 03:50.040
Cheers.

03:52.548 --> 03:53.537
Cheers.

03:54.150 --> 03:58.382
It is especially gratifying to be
surrounded by such good friends...

03:58.554 --> 03:59.680
...and family...

04:00.056 --> 04:04.186
...and of course,
our two beautiful daughters...

04:04.360 --> 04:05.657
...Sadie...

04:05.828 --> 04:07.420
...and Lindsey...

04:07.597 --> 04:09.690
...who has moved back home with us...

04:11.301 --> 04:13.394
...to try and make a new start for herself.

04:13.569 --> 04:14.729
We are...

04:15.638 --> 04:18.664
...so thrilled with her perseverance.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.844
Thank you for the support, Dad.

04:24.314 --> 04:28.216
And then there's Carlisle, Sadie's best
friend, who used to take baths with Sadie...

04:28.384 --> 04:29.851
- What?
- What?

04:30.019 --> 04:35.013
...when they were younger,
and pretend he was a submarine captain.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.682
I destroyed all the photos.
I promise you.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.852
- Thank you. 
Very good to know. Thanks.
- Wait, what?

04:41.030 --> 04:43.089
And our good friends, 
Don and Gwen...

04:43.266 --> 04:45.131
...Kwan-Li...

04:45.301 --> 04:46.791
...Jerry, Otis.

04:47.136 --> 04:48.728
Dad...

04:49.272 --> 04:50.261
...what about...

04:50.440 --> 04:52.271
- What about Ben?
- Oh, no, no, no.

04:53.242 --> 04:57.440
Oh, and of course, there's
Sadie's affable boyfriend, Ben.

04:58.514 --> 05:00.038
But what I really want to do...

05:00.216 --> 05:02.616
...is thank my beautiful wife...

05:03.219 --> 05:08.054
...without whom this life
would mean nothing.

05:08.257 --> 05:10.851
Happy 30th anniversary.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.988
- I love you.
- I love you too.

05:15.164 --> 05:17.223
And I hope there are 30 more.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.800
Well, that makes one of us.

05:28.544 --> 05:30.978
Excuse me.
Could I have everyone's attention, please?

05:32.715 --> 05:34.239
I just wanted to...

05:40.690 --> 05:43.386
Well, I thought since
everyone was gathered...

05:43.559 --> 05:45.618
...gathered already...

05:48.765 --> 05:50.130
Oh, my God.

05:51.567 --> 05:52.556
Oh, my God.

05:52.735 --> 05:54.669
- Sadie...
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

05:54.837 --> 05:56.464
...Wilhelmina Jones.

05:58.274 --> 06:03.177
In front of God and your family...

06:03.513 --> 06:09.281
...Kwan-Li, and Jerry and Otis and...

06:11.354 --> 06:13.549
I just want to know...

06:13.723 --> 06:16.692
...if you would spend the rest
of your life with me.

06:19.195 --> 06:20.253
But I don't...

06:20.430 --> 06:22.625
I don't want to put you
on the spot or anything.

06:22.799 --> 06:27.759
Benjamin Murphy, I would marry you
tomorrow in a potato-sack dress...

06:27.937 --> 06:32.340
...in the middle of a rainstorm, if it meant
I could spend the rest of my life with you.

06:37.914 --> 06:39.142
Wait a second.

06:40.149 --> 06:46.418
You choose our 30th wedding anniversary
to propose to my daughter?

06:49.192 --> 06:50.659
Well...

06:51.160 --> 06:53.060
...we couldn't be happier.

06:53.229 --> 06:55.356
Oh, my gosh.

06:55.531 --> 06:56.725
I know.

06:58.568 --> 07:00.536
New brother-in-law-to-be, I guess.

07:00.703 --> 07:02.830
- Oh, man. Hey, hello.
- Awkward.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.870
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

07:06.776 --> 07:08.903
- Welcome to the family, Ben.
- Sir. All right!

07:09.078 --> 07:11.569
- Oh, my baby.
- Oh, honey, I'm so happy for you.

07:11.747 --> 07:13.806
Look at this beautiful ring.

07:13.983 --> 07:16.042
Sadie, Sadie, I was thinking...

07:16.452 --> 07:20.081
I think we should have the wedding
somewhere tropical. I was thinking, like...

07:20.256 --> 07:21.723
...the Caribbean.

07:21.891 --> 07:23.620
I have this one thing.

07:25.761 --> 07:27.251
Okay.

07:27.430 --> 07:29.057
I always wanted
to get married here.

07:30.466 --> 07:33.299
Here.
What do you mean?

07:33.469 --> 07:34.697
At Saint Augustine's.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.363
It's this fantasy I've had
since I was a little girl.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.406
It's the church where
John and I married.

07:40.576 --> 07:43.841
Where Sadie was christened by
Reverend Frank, who's known us forever.

07:44.013 --> 07:47.210
More importantly, it's the church
Sadie's grandfather built.

07:48.484 --> 07:49.610
Her dead grandfather.

07:49.785 --> 07:53.721
Oh, give me a break.
All he built was a door after it was stolen.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.983
How would you know?
You weren't married there.

07:56.159 --> 07:58.286
And we all know
how that marriage turned out.

07:58.461 --> 07:59.928
Mom!

08:00.096 --> 08:02.724
- Stop.
- Here, here, here, here.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.265
Babe, you've made me so
unbelievably happy today.

08:05.434 --> 08:06.423
You have no idea.

08:06.636 --> 08:08.001
- Great.
- Yeah.

08:08.171 --> 08:10.765
Then Saint Augustine's...

08:10.940 --> 08:13.909
...is the decision.
- Thank you, I love you.

08:14.210 --> 08:16.235
- You ready?
- I'm missing a shoe.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.972
- Well, where did you last see it?
- I don't know.

08:19.148 --> 08:21.639
You know, Ben,
your sweater's actually inside out?

08:21.817 --> 08:23.808
Gotta fix that.

08:23.986 --> 08:25.317
What would you do without me?

08:25.488 --> 08:27.854
You want the short list or the long list?

08:28.024 --> 08:29.889
Oh, and your belt?

08:30.059 --> 08:32.118
- It's a little funny.
- No, my belt's fine.

08:34.063 --> 08:35.087
Wait a minute.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.289
- We're gonna be really late.
- No, we're not.

08:37.466 --> 08:38.693
Yeah, we are.

08:38.868 --> 08:40.893
And your point is?

08:49.545 --> 08:50.773
How do I look?

08:50.947 --> 08:53.575
- You look like you've just been...
- All right, never mind.

08:53.749 --> 08:55.580
We're so going to hell, you know that?

08:55.751 --> 08:59.517
- Hey, here's the door Grandpa built.
- Wow, he does really good work.

09:15.338 --> 09:17.169
Don't touch that!

09:17.506 --> 09:19.269
Jesus! You scared me.

09:19.709 --> 09:22.200
Jesus didn't scare you, I did.

09:23.112 --> 09:26.548
- Hi, I'm Sadie...
- Sadie Jones. Yes, I know.

09:26.716 --> 09:28.513
You have a 10:30 with Reverend Frank.

09:28.718 --> 09:30.015
Yeah. Is he here?

09:30.920 --> 09:32.547
Reverend Frank is everywhere.

09:32.722 --> 09:34.383
Follow me.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.724
"Dear <i>ELLE</i> magazine:

09:40.896 --> 09:43.387
I just found out that my husband
of three months...

09:43.566 --> 09:46.034
...is cheating on me with my best friend.

09:46.202 --> 09:50.104
Half of me wants to kill him, the other
half wants to salvage my marriage.

09:50.273 --> 09:51.331
What to do?"

09:51.507 --> 09:52.496
Yikes.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.939
What kind of sins are we
dealing with here, guys?

09:55.111 --> 09:57.443
- Sarah.
- Thou shall not commit adultery?

09:57.613 --> 10:00.707
Adultery. Going out for milk
when you have jugs at home.

10:00.883 --> 10:02.976
Show me adultery!

10:04.420 --> 10:06.752
Not neat to cheat! Okay!

10:06.922 --> 10:08.480
Now, a lot of people ask me:

10:08.658 --> 10:11.456
"What if I'm cheating with a woman
who's really, really ugly?

10:11.627 --> 10:12.958
Does that make it all right?"

10:13.129 --> 10:15.893
No, it does not make it all right.
It is still a sin.

10:16.399 --> 10:18.094
What other sins? Anybody?

10:18.267 --> 10:21.031
Don't hesitate to draw on
your parents' bad examples.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.331
- Laurie. Bring it, girl.
- Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.873
Starts with coveting, ends with the clap.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.978
Okay, coveting thy neighbor's wife.

10:30.146 --> 10:33.081
That's why God invented
the cold shower. Show me coveting!

10:35.885 --> 10:37.375
Good one, Laurie!

10:37.553 --> 10:40.818
Okay, there's one answer left on the board.
Let's see.

10:40.990 --> 10:42.355
Manny.

10:44.627 --> 10:46.458
Make your two moms proud.

10:48.597 --> 10:51.691
Come on, Manny,
you can murder this one.

10:52.635 --> 10:56.662
While I'm waiting, maybe I'll just
fashion a shiv out of Cindy's barrette.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.107
Take a stab at it.

11:03.512 --> 11:05.139
Thou shall not kill?

11:05.581 --> 11:07.811
Boom, Manny!
Bang, bang, bang!

11:09.118 --> 11:10.915
Show me thou shall not kill!

11:12.488 --> 11:15.355
Oh, good one, Manny!
Manny, Manny, Manny.

11:15.524 --> 11:16.650
That's it for today.

11:16.826 --> 11:19.056
Next we're gonna take
a trip to Arlington Park.

11:19.228 --> 11:22.026
We're gonna find out about
the evils of gambling firsthand.

11:22.198 --> 11:23.825
So bring at least a dollar...

11:23.999 --> 11:27.332
...and remember to ask Mom and Dad
what a trifecta is.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.568
I don't know if you remember me,
Reverend Frank, but...

11:33.743 --> 11:35.643
Sadie Jones?

11:35.811 --> 11:37.711
Little Sadie Jones.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.575
- How you've grown.
- Well, yeah.

11:39.749 --> 11:42.183
And now my Sadie Jones
is gonna tie the knot.

11:42.351 --> 11:43.340
I am.

11:43.519 --> 11:45.749
I'm sorry I haven't been around
for the last...

11:45.921 --> 11:46.910
Ten years.

11:47.089 --> 11:48.078
Yeah.

11:48.257 --> 11:50.191
I've just been trying to get
my business...

11:50.359 --> 11:51.690
Oh, please.

11:51.894 --> 11:54.158
You go to college,
you have a bisexual roommate...

11:54.330 --> 11:56.161
...you forget about God.
Don't sweat it.

11:56.332 --> 11:57.629
He doesn't forget about you.

12:00.269 --> 12:01.759
Who are you?

12:02.605 --> 12:03.594
I'm Ben.

12:03.773 --> 12:04.762
- Ben.
- Hi.

12:04.940 --> 12:07.636
So, what do you do,
besides little Sadie here?

12:10.346 --> 12:11.335
How are you?

12:11.781 --> 12:14.682
All right, let's get the flock out of here.
Come on.

12:14.850 --> 12:16.442
So, how long you two been an item?

12:16.619 --> 12:18.553
- About...
- Like...

12:18.721 --> 12:20.552
Yeah!

12:22.658 --> 12:24.387
It's been teetering there for weeks.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.027
- Cheesy Curl?
- No, thank you.

12:26.195 --> 12:28.186
Too bad, they're addicting.

12:32.201 --> 12:33.930
- Booked.
- Booked. Booked.

12:34.103 --> 12:35.695
Nothing there or there.

12:35.871 --> 12:37.202
I am popular.

12:37.373 --> 12:39.364
Yes, you are.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.872
All full. Not looking good. No.

12:44.213 --> 12:47.011
No, no, no.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.380
- Nope, nope, nope.
- Booked, booked, booked.

12:59.595 --> 13:01.119
Bad news, guys.

13:01.297 --> 13:03.891
- Next available date is in two years.
- Two years?

13:04.934 --> 13:05.923
That's...

13:06.602 --> 13:08.365
...so long.
- Yeah.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.963
Wait.

13:11.407 --> 13:13.705
- Hold on, hold on.
- Wasn't there a cancellation?

13:14.376 --> 13:16.742
- I think it's...
- There, there!

13:16.912 --> 13:18.072
Yes, there it is.

13:18.247 --> 13:20.340
Three weeks from tomorrow, how is that?

13:22.384 --> 13:24.784
That's a little quick.
Right? I mean...

13:27.056 --> 13:29.388
Okay, I guess we're getting married
in three weeks.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.253
Okay.

13:31.427 --> 13:32.724
- Just like that?
- Yeah.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.854
- So it is written, so it shall be done.
- So it shall be done.

13:37.099 --> 13:39.294
Oh, boy.

13:39.468 --> 13:41.129
All right.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.667
One small thing.

13:43.839 --> 13:47.400
Couple years ago I instituted
a marriage preparation course here.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.272
The course is a prerequisite
for all marriage ceremonies...

13:50.446 --> 13:52.778
...performed on these grounds.

13:53.015 --> 13:55.677
At the end of the course,
if I feel you're unprepared...

13:55.851 --> 14:00.413
...or you stop the course before completion,
I have the right to call off the wedding.

14:00.589 --> 14:05.049
I'm sorry, but this isn't mandatory, right?
Because we're so ready to get married.

14:05.227 --> 14:07.320
- More than most.
- We strongly advise it.

14:07.496 --> 14:09.589
In other words, you have no choice.

14:09.899 --> 14:11.594
With the divorce rate what it is...

14:11.767 --> 14:12.927
50 percent.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.297
Much higher for those
who live together first.

14:15.638 --> 14:17.799
You did say you lived together, right?

14:19.341 --> 14:21.206
I'm sorry, who are you again?

14:21.377 --> 14:23.470
I'm part of the Ministers
of Tomorrow program.

14:23.646 --> 14:25.341
Reverend Frank's my mentor.

14:25.514 --> 14:26.776
My little Mensa.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.814
- I can see.
- Listen, kids.

14:28.984 --> 14:31.646
We wanna make sure you
are making the right decision...

14:31.820 --> 14:34.288
...because your future happiness
depends on it.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.617
Reverend Frank has a hundred
percent success...

14:36.792 --> 14:38.987
...for those that make it
through the course.

14:39.161 --> 14:41.629
- But what about the people who...?
- Okay, we'll do it.

14:42.831 --> 14:44.890
- We're gonna do it.
- We're doing that?

14:45.067 --> 14:46.534
- It's awesome.
- We're doing this.

14:46.735 --> 14:47.793
That's my Sadie.

14:48.470 --> 14:52.031
All right, we have three months of prep
to cram into three weeks.

14:52.207 --> 14:53.697
There's only a few rules.

14:53.876 --> 14:56.777
Rule number one:
you each have to write your own vows.

14:56.946 --> 14:59.141
You have a booklet,
and you share these vows...

14:59.315 --> 15:01.510
...with each other at the ceremony.

15:02.551 --> 15:04.815
- That's really cool.
- Isn't it?

15:04.987 --> 15:06.454
Okay. What's rule number two?

15:06.622 --> 15:08.988
Starting immediately,
no sex until the honeymoon.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.620
I...

15:18.400 --> 15:19.492
Are you serious?

15:20.069 --> 15:21.366
Oh, yeah.

15:23.606 --> 15:25.267
Tomorrow morning,
bright and early.

15:25.441 --> 15:26.430
Be there.

15:26.609 --> 15:28.338
We all remember the 11 th Commandment.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.738
I don't.

15:30.646 --> 15:32.341
Thou shall not be late.

15:35.884 --> 15:38.182
We've got a hundred things
to start, but it's doable.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.447
I just have to get Carlisle on the phone.

15:40.623 --> 15:44.457
- He was kidding about the no-sex thing?
- Carlisle? It's me. Get ready for this.

15:44.627 --> 15:47.187
- We will talk about the no-sex thing later.
- Okay, Ben.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.092
No sex?

15:49.264 --> 15:52.165
That's supposed to happen
after you get married.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.558
Joel, I come here...

15:53.736 --> 15:56.068
...for your compassion.
- I'm just giving you shit.

15:56.238 --> 15:58.729
Congratulations.
You are going to love marriage.

15:58.907 --> 16:00.807
Damn it, Joel.
What is wrong with you?

16:00.976 --> 16:03.103
You were supposed to be
watching them.

16:03.278 --> 16:04.905
Shelly, baby, I'm on the roof.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.742
Remember we said you won't
bother me when I'm on the roof?

16:07.916 --> 16:10.009
- You're always on the roof.
- Exactly.

16:10.185 --> 16:11.982
- I heard that.
- Yeah.

16:12.154 --> 16:14.019
Where did this mud hole
even come from?

16:14.189 --> 16:16.885
Oh, my God,
I am so getting my tubes tied.

16:17.059 --> 16:21.223
This reverend says he wants me to meet
him after church tomorrow one-on-one.

16:21.997 --> 16:23.589
What is that?

16:23.766 --> 16:25.757
You ever done that?
The marriage prep stuff?

16:25.934 --> 16:28.994
To tell you the truth, I don't remember
anything before D-day, man.

16:29.638 --> 16:31.196
It's like a black hole.

16:31.373 --> 16:33.807
All I know is that's my wife...

16:33.976 --> 16:35.637
...apparently those are my kids...

16:35.811 --> 16:38.609
...and this, this is my beer.

16:38.781 --> 16:41.511
Everything else is pretty much a blur.

16:42.117 --> 16:43.209
Yeah.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.348
Thank you.

16:45.521 --> 16:47.011
That's why you're my best man.

16:48.123 --> 16:49.920
Two words for your bachelor party:

16:50.092 --> 16:51.650
Strippers and Sizzler.

16:53.195 --> 16:55.095
I like to call it "beef and booty."

16:55.264 --> 16:57.357
I heard that.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.590
Oh, boy.

17:06.340 --> 17:08.570
Please, God, let somebody
be later than us.

17:08.743 --> 17:13.044
Hey. We'll just sneak in the back,
no one will notice.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.007
We also ask...

17:15.184 --> 17:19.211
...that you watch over the Mansbridge
meat packers and their labor dispute.

17:19.387 --> 17:22.983
Grant our packers patience
as they await an amicable resolution...

17:23.392 --> 17:26.792
...with, Lord willing,
a four to six percent pay increase...

17:26.962 --> 17:28.793
...and dental would be nice.

17:33.836 --> 17:36.464
Look who decided to show.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.742
Choir! Let me hear it!

17:41.944 --> 17:45.607
<i>You're late, you're late</i>
<i>You're late, you're late</i>

17:45.781 --> 17:48.978
<i>God's on time</i>

17:49.151 --> 17:52.780
<i>But you are very late</i>

17:54.623 --> 17:57.717
It's your first offense.
We'll let it slide.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.020
It happens again, I'm telling the Big Guy.

18:01.196 --> 18:04.097
And I'm not talking about
Larry Carmichael over there on drums.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.366
But seriously...

18:07.736 --> 18:10.204
...let us re-pray.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.739
Sorry for bailing, Lord.
A brief interruption, but we're back.

18:14.910 --> 18:16.810
We'd also like to pray for Walter...

18:16.979 --> 18:19.243
...recently returned from his
holiday in Thailand.

18:19.414 --> 18:21.075
Let's hope it's just a heat rash.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.247
- Vivian.
- I don't know how you do it, Frank.

18:24.419 --> 18:26.546
Every week your sermons
get better and better.

18:26.722 --> 18:30.055
It comes from upstairs, Vivian.
I'm just the TiVo.

18:30.759 --> 18:32.124
It wasn't that good.

18:32.294 --> 18:33.454
- You ready?
- Yeah.

18:34.763 --> 18:36.560
I have to go. I have stuff to do...

18:36.732 --> 18:39.098
...but you guys enjoy
your man-talk, okay?

18:39.268 --> 18:41.327
Don't say anything about me
behind my back.

18:41.503 --> 18:44.028
You'll never know so...

18:44.506 --> 18:45.666
Tight.

18:45.841 --> 18:47.433
- Sorry?
- The car.

18:47.943 --> 18:50.207
- Hi.
- Bye.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.238
You ready? A little one-on-one?

18:53.415 --> 18:55.076
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.013
The name of our team is the Crusaders.

18:57.186 --> 19:01.350
I didn't want to tell the kids about the
Children's Crusades, it bums them out.

19:01.523 --> 19:03.548
Wow, you really meant one-on-one.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.317
Oh, yeah.

19:05.694 --> 19:07.025
- A little hoops?
- No.

19:07.196 --> 19:08.322
This ball needs Viagra.

19:09.765 --> 19:11.426
- Play catch?
- Sure, love catch.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.830
It's my favorite sport.

19:14.002 --> 19:16.266
Pardon the glove.
We've had a few budget cutbacks.

19:16.438 --> 19:18.099
- Oh, that's all right.
- Back up.

19:18.674 --> 19:19.902
Okay.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.600
What are you, a little girl's softball league?
Back up.

19:22.778 --> 19:24.177
Okay. Not a little girl.

19:24.346 --> 19:25.677
- Yeah.
- All right.

19:25.848 --> 19:27.713
It's nice to be able to chat with you...

19:27.883 --> 19:31.114
...without all this "I'm a pastor
who can send you to hell" nonsense.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.714
No, me too. This is great.

19:32.888 --> 19:35.152
Little one-on-one time
with your spiritual elder.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.025
Bless you, Benjamin.

19:39.161 --> 19:41.629
- Too hard?
- No. That's a...

19:41.797 --> 19:43.492
That's a good burn. Right?

19:43.665 --> 19:46.395
Anything that's painful
makes you stronger.

19:46.568 --> 19:49.435
Not really. You break your leg,
your leg doesn't get stronger.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.800
God is just, but God is kind.

19:53.842 --> 19:55.867
That's a nice sentiment.

19:56.645 --> 19:58.340
Thank you.
Can I ask you something?

19:58.513 --> 20:00.003
- Sure.
- Sadie.

20:00.182 --> 20:01.774
Why do you love her?

20:03.085 --> 20:04.916
There's just so many reasons, you know?

20:05.087 --> 20:07.555
She's beautiful, inside and out.

20:07.723 --> 20:09.418
So, I'm lucky.

20:09.591 --> 20:11.650
What do you mean by "inside"?

20:12.828 --> 20:14.352
You meant spiritually, right?

20:14.529 --> 20:16.224
Yep. Exactly.

20:16.398 --> 20:18.423
Okay. What else?

20:20.269 --> 20:24.035
She's just smart, you know?
She's motivated, she's well-organized.

20:24.206 --> 20:26.106
She's probably
the hardest worker I know.

20:27.175 --> 20:30.042
Well, let me get this straight, then.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

20:30.212 --> 20:33.340
First thing you like about her is her looks.
But you really think...

20:33.515 --> 20:35.881
...she's a cute control freak.
- I didn't say that.

20:36.051 --> 20:40.647
- I know what you're getting at.
- "Organized" is code for OCD.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.380
OCD is a...

20:42.557 --> 20:43.649
God!

20:45.661 --> 20:47.788
Oh, my Lord.

20:48.397 --> 20:49.762
- You okay, big fella?
- Yeah.

20:49.932 --> 20:51.092
Oh, yeah?

20:51.266 --> 20:52.733
- How you doing...
- Totally fine.

20:52.901 --> 20:55.392
Let's see that. Come on.
Oh, no. That's bad.

20:55.570 --> 20:56.867
I'm gonna have to heal you.

20:57.439 --> 20:59.703
- No, that's okay.
- No. I'm gonna have to heal you.

20:59.875 --> 21:02.241
- I just need Advil.
- It's healing time. Stay down.

21:02.411 --> 21:04.345
Stay down. It's healing time.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.509
- What's that mean?
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.708
Oh, Lord, surround him
with your light and grace.

21:09.885 --> 21:11.409
Lord have mercy!

21:11.586 --> 21:13.918
- The power of Christ compels you!
- Lord have mercy.

21:14.089 --> 21:15.716
The power of Christ compels you!

21:15.891 --> 21:18.223
- We have got to pray!
- Pray!

21:18.393 --> 21:19.951
- We have got to pray!
- Pray!

21:20.128 --> 21:22.255
We have got to pray to make it
through the day!

21:22.831 --> 21:23.855
Is that MC Hammer?

21:24.266 --> 21:27.258
- You're healed, right?
- Let me see. Let me see.

21:27.436 --> 21:30.803
- No, it's still bleeding.
- Let's go old school.

21:33.075 --> 21:35.339
Begone, demon spirit!

21:35.510 --> 21:37.239
Begone!

21:38.480 --> 21:41.472
- That's not helping at all.
- Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

21:41.650 --> 21:43.277
Lord, take him up upon your wing...

21:43.452 --> 21:46.012
- Wait, take me where?
- lf you believed, you'd be healed.

21:46.188 --> 21:47.587
- Do you believe?
- Believe!

21:47.756 --> 21:49.849
- Believe!
- I'm healed, I'm healed, I'm healed.

21:50.025 --> 21:52.789
- Oh, it's a miracle! It's a miracle!
- It is. It is.

21:52.961 --> 21:55.259
You're not healed.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a pastor.

21:55.430 --> 21:58.263
You know what you need?
Advil and ice. Come on.

21:58.433 --> 22:02.369
- Check him out, just see that he's okay.
- The nasal septum and concha are clear.

22:02.537 --> 22:06.029
- Good news, kid. Your nose is fine.
- Yeah, come on. Let me buy you a Coke.

22:06.208 --> 22:08.642
Sorry about that.
You know, I have to try that stuff.

22:08.810 --> 22:11.938
- Never works, but what if it had?
- Yeah.

22:12.114 --> 22:13.911
- Wouldn't that be crazy?
- Crazy.

22:15.150 --> 22:17.209
It was great.

22:17.386 --> 22:19.980
Yes, totally.
Reverend Frank is the best.

22:20.155 --> 22:23.181
Listen, tomorrow night, I was th...

22:23.759 --> 22:26.819
Group counseling for what?

22:32.334 --> 22:33.699
Okay, like we do every week.

22:33.869 --> 22:36.531
Danny, pick up Tenika
and carry her across that threshold.

22:36.705 --> 22:38.002
Yeah, that's it!

22:38.173 --> 22:40.505
Try and think of it like the first time.

22:40.675 --> 22:42.802
For a lot of you,
that wasn't the honeymoon.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.679
Yeah, baby. Come on, Jim.

22:46.848 --> 22:48.008
My back is giving out.

22:48.183 --> 22:49.377
Don't focus on the pain.

22:49.551 --> 22:52.679
Look at the love that
Janine's giving you right now.

22:52.854 --> 22:55.448
And if that doesn't work,
think about potato skins.

22:55.991 --> 22:57.982
God, I love potato skins.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.287
A husband will do anything
for appetizers.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.520
Yes.

23:03.231 --> 23:05.859
Everybody, I want to introduce you
to two new members.

23:06.034 --> 23:08.901
This is Ben and Sadie.
They're getting married in three weeks.

23:09.071 --> 23:11.505
Ben, why don't you carry Sadie
across the threshold?

23:12.074 --> 23:13.598
Come on.

23:13.975 --> 23:16.842
Come on. Yeah, come on.

23:17.679 --> 23:19.840
Yeah, there you go.
Get across that threshold!

23:26.354 --> 23:28.049
Hurry.

23:28.890 --> 23:32.326
- Oh, great.
- Look.

23:55.383 --> 23:57.112
Got it.

24:01.156 --> 24:02.316
Tonight...

24:02.491 --> 24:05.085
...we learn how to fight fairly.

24:05.760 --> 24:06.749
Sorry.

24:06.928 --> 24:09.260
What if we've never had a fight before?

24:10.198 --> 24:12.666
- Seriously think I'm gonna puke.
- Louise, no puking.

24:12.834 --> 24:15.496
They're young.
They're allowed to be enthusiastic.

24:16.004 --> 24:18.404
Never had a fight,
it's about time you had one.

24:18.573 --> 24:20.973
So please, step up
to the top of the circle.

24:21.143 --> 24:23.008
Come on, get your butts up there!

24:23.178 --> 24:25.942
Let's get this perfect relationship
on its feet.

24:26.114 --> 24:28.378
Put it to the test. Okay.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.245
I want you to imagine.

24:30.418 --> 24:32.818
You're driving in the mountains.
It's nighttime.

24:32.988 --> 24:34.853
But there's a torrential downpour.

24:35.023 --> 24:36.752
That thing with the wipers like this:

24:37.425 --> 24:39.393
You're tired. You're lost.

24:39.794 --> 24:41.159
You're getting cranky.

24:41.630 --> 24:43.461
What was that?

24:43.632 --> 24:45.964
You got a flat tire
because you just hit a pothole.

24:46.334 --> 24:48.529
Instant argument potential.

24:48.703 --> 24:50.432
What do you do? How do you handle it?

24:51.072 --> 24:53.006
I think we'd probably just call AAA.

24:54.242 --> 24:57.678
Out of cell phone range.
Can't use the cell phone. Can't call AAA.

24:57.846 --> 25:01.043
You gotta handle it the old-fashioned way.
You gotta change the tire.

25:01.216 --> 25:04.083
You're pissed at each other. Go.

25:06.922 --> 25:10.119
Sorry I didn't see that pothole.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.116
It's okay, honey.

25:12.294 --> 25:15.263
Accidents happen,
so just be more careful next time.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.489
- Promise I will.
- Cut!

25:17.666 --> 25:20.726
You guys travel medicated?
That was like "Prozac Takes a Vacation."

25:20.902 --> 25:22.597
That's not what we're looking for.

25:22.771 --> 25:26.867
Janine, why don't you and Jimbo show
them how this argument should play out?

25:27.042 --> 25:28.532
Sure.

25:32.981 --> 25:34.448
Hey, jackass!

25:34.616 --> 25:37.881
I told you to take Route 45,
but again, you didn't listen!

25:38.053 --> 25:42.319
Now it's pissing down outside
and we're stuck God only knows where.

25:42.490 --> 25:45.391
Yeah, well, if we hadn't
left three hours late...

25:45.560 --> 25:49.519
...because someone was talking
to her ball-busting mother on the phone...

25:50.065 --> 25:52.659
...well, then, maybe we wouldn't
be in this position!

25:52.834 --> 25:55.359
You are a sad, sad man.

25:55.537 --> 25:58.665
You will not emasculate me anymore.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.001
- Go to hell!
- No, you go to hell, Janine.

26:01.176 --> 26:04.407
- Go to hell.
- Okay. Cut.

26:05.080 --> 26:07.048
Everybody, Jim and Janine.

26:09.351 --> 26:11.683
We're gonna try something
a little different now.

26:11.853 --> 26:14.413
We're gonna do role reversal.

26:15.023 --> 26:16.354
All right.

26:16.524 --> 26:18.355
Sadie, I want you to be Ben.

26:18.526 --> 26:21.120
Ben, I want you to be Sadie.
Come on. Step up there.

26:21.296 --> 26:22.957
Come on, get up! Yeah!

26:23.131 --> 26:25.395
- Oh, gosh.
- Come on.

26:25.567 --> 26:27.034
You're gonna change the tire.

26:27.202 --> 26:28.999
Ben, tire's down here.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.434
You're down in that muck.
Here's your lug wrench.

26:31.606 --> 26:33.767
The lugs are right here.
But they're tight.

26:33.942 --> 26:37.844
They're rusty, they're old, all right?
You can't get them off and you're angry...

26:38.013 --> 26:41.744
...and you're cold, and you really...
You wanna tear each other apart.

26:41.916 --> 26:43.406
Go.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.321
Don't you wish
we were in cell-phone range?

26:47.489 --> 26:50.117
Then we could just call
AAA like we always do.

26:50.292 --> 26:53.784
- Yeah, I don't know how we got so lost.
- I don't either.

26:53.962 --> 26:56.021
Ben, maybe we wouldn't
have gotten lost...

26:56.197 --> 27:00.361
...if you had just followed the TripTik
that I prepared three days in advance.

27:00.535 --> 27:03.834
Well, I thought that I was following
the road signs pretty well.

27:04.005 --> 27:07.099
Just going with the flow, as usual.

27:08.677 --> 27:10.542
What was that?
What was that last thing?

27:10.712 --> 27:13.875
I'm just going along for the ride.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.745
Who was? You. As me.

27:18.353 --> 27:20.685
Well, I'm not really sure
how anything gets done...

27:20.855 --> 27:25.918
...if people aren't following my
very specific instructions, Ben.

27:26.227 --> 27:28.718
But I love it when you're in charge.

27:28.897 --> 27:32.298
That way I don't have to
take too much responsibility, Sadie.

27:32.467 --> 27:36.335
Ben, don't you know that that's the only
way things get done around here?

27:36.971 --> 27:39.030
That's how things get done around here?
Good.

27:39.207 --> 27:40.606
I had no idea.

27:40.775 --> 27:42.709
- Thank you.
- Want me to show you?

27:42.877 --> 27:46.108
- He said counter...
- I think I have it under control!

27:50.151 --> 27:51.743
Dear Jesus!

27:51.920 --> 27:54.354
- Potato skins down!
- Jim, Jim...

27:56.591 --> 27:58.923
Come on, everybody!

27:59.127 --> 28:01.721
Five-second rule!

28:02.497 --> 28:03.828
Janine!

28:05.367 --> 28:07.164
Okay.
We'll pick up next week...

28:07.335 --> 28:09.667
...with balancing
the joint checking account.

28:16.478 --> 28:19.447
So are you writing your vows later or...?

28:19.614 --> 28:22.139
No, I finished earlier.

28:22.917 --> 28:25.545
Hey, what color white should we
go with for the napkins?

28:25.720 --> 28:27.119
There's ivory...

28:27.288 --> 28:28.653
...and timid.

28:29.691 --> 28:30.988
Ivory.

28:31.159 --> 28:36.119
I don't know, I kind of feel like it might
clash with the pistachio in the centerpieces.

28:36.297 --> 28:41.132
All right, well, you know what?
I'll just ask Carlisle tomorrow.

28:41.770 --> 28:44.705
<i>Yeah, you know who else you could ask?</i>
<i>Reverend Frank.</i>

28:44.873 --> 28:46.568
<i>Because he loves giving his opinion.</i>

28:46.741 --> 28:48.208
<i>Why do you say it like that?</i>

28:48.376 --> 28:50.003
<i>I don't know. Maybe because...</i>

28:50.178 --> 28:52.646
...he's just a little bit...
- Knowledgeable.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.749
- Yeah.
- "Intrusive." I was gonna go with intrusive.

28:57.352 --> 28:59.684
Ben, he's not intrusive, you know?
He's just...

28:59.854 --> 29:02.721
...observing our relationship right now.

29:03.057 --> 29:07.187
- Like a voyeur.
- Reverend Frank is not like a voyeur.

29:07.395 --> 29:09.863
- <i>A little bit.</i>
- <i>No, he's not.</i>

29:12.333 --> 29:14.858
What was that? What are you doing?

29:15.036 --> 29:16.731
Do you want to walk the midget?

29:16.905 --> 29:18.031
Course I do, but...

29:18.206 --> 29:22.108
<i>... I don't think we should, because it's</i>
<i>against the rules until after the wedding.</i>

29:23.044 --> 29:24.875
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

29:25.246 --> 29:27.806
- You're actually following that rule?
- Yeah.

29:27.982 --> 29:31.383
Because I want to pass the course.
Don't you?

29:32.153 --> 29:34.713
- Yes, I want to pass the course.
- So?

29:34.889 --> 29:39.121
So, I also want to play Pickle Me, Tickle Me
with my really hot fiancée.

29:40.562 --> 29:42.052
Okay?

29:42.230 --> 29:44.960
- Come on.
- What?

29:45.133 --> 29:46.430
No one else is gonna know.

29:46.601 --> 29:49.968
I'll know, Ben. I will know.
So just...

29:50.138 --> 29:51.696
Just please...

29:51.873 --> 29:55.639
...let's stick to the program for now.
Okay? Thank you.

29:57.078 --> 29:59.308
Three weeks never killed anyone.

29:59.481 --> 30:01.346
Really?
Has that ever been documented?

30:01.516 --> 30:03.006
Good night.

30:07.755 --> 30:09.586
Good night, Ben.

30:17.966 --> 30:20.764
Okay, I'm a cigar vendor...

30:22.437 --> 30:24.268
- What?
- Go to bed.

30:24.439 --> 30:26.100
Thank you.

30:29.377 --> 30:31.140
What if I'm not tired?

30:31.813 --> 30:33.474
Yes!

30:33.648 --> 30:34.740
All clear.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.680
- What'd I miss?
- None of your business.

30:37.852 --> 30:41.253
- But they're right on schedule.
- Their optimism is touching.

30:41.422 --> 30:43.982
They remind me of the Anderson couple
we had last month.

30:44.158 --> 30:46.217
Yeah. You know what time it is?

30:46.661 --> 30:48.026
Time to turn up the heat.

30:48.196 --> 30:50.596
It's time to build on the foundation
we've set up.

30:51.799 --> 30:53.699
Remind me never to cross you.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.571
I mean, I'm really glad
we're doing the course.

31:05.747 --> 31:08.272
I just wish Ben would take it
more seriously, you know?

31:08.449 --> 31:10.417
What about these
in my bouquet, Lindsey?

31:10.585 --> 31:11.813
No.

31:11.986 --> 31:13.283
No?

31:13.454 --> 31:18.084
I just want to feel some enthusiasm
from him, or is that expecting too much?

31:18.259 --> 31:21.092
Sadie, you have so much
to learn about men.

31:21.563 --> 31:23.258
Pink.

31:24.465 --> 31:27.161
Flowers by Sadie, Sadie speaking.

31:28.002 --> 31:29.526
Meet where?

31:29.704 --> 31:31.638
I didn't even want to take this course...

31:31.806 --> 31:34.331
...and now she's following it
to, like, the nth degree.

31:34.509 --> 31:37.376
Where are the cheerleaders?
Shouldn't they be practicing too?

31:37.545 --> 31:40.844
Come on, Famaletti! Deny that baseline!

31:41.015 --> 31:43.643
Coach Murphy, you were right
to put him on B-squad.

31:43.818 --> 31:46.548
- Get ready, Zach.
- Or maybe I'm just overreacting.

31:46.721 --> 31:49.781
I mean, give and take, that's a part of
every healthy relationship.

31:50.124 --> 31:51.250
Give and what?

31:51.426 --> 31:53.087
- Give and take.
- Man, listen to me.

31:53.561 --> 31:57.122
Once a woman senses she has control,
she'll tell a thousand of her friends.

31:57.298 --> 32:01.291
Then they'll want control too.
"I want a little piece of this control stuff."

32:01.469 --> 32:05.599
Next thing you know, they'll be running
companies and having their own offices.

32:05.773 --> 32:09.539
Do not set dangerous precedents
for other men.

32:12.113 --> 32:13.774
Hello?

32:14.449 --> 32:15.438
Late for what?

32:15.617 --> 32:19.849
Welcome to Saint Catherine's Maternity,
birthplace to over 4000 babies each year.

32:20.021 --> 32:23.115
That's almost 80 babies a week,
and we've never misplaced one.

32:23.291 --> 32:24.280
Okay, maybe one.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.995
If you're shy, get your tubes tied now
and call it a day.

32:28.162 --> 32:30.756
A woman in labor basically
lies around almost naked...

32:30.932 --> 32:34.493
...while dozens of doctors and nurses
get a front row view of her wide open...

32:34.669 --> 32:37.001
Virginia! Put some gloves
on those hands right now!

32:37.171 --> 32:38.729
We're not delivering pizzas here.

32:38.906 --> 32:42.467
Labor could last anywhere from
a few hours to a few days.

32:43.177 --> 32:47.580
And that's not even counting the nine
months of constipation leading up to it.

32:47.749 --> 32:49.444
Of course, there's always drugs...

32:49.617 --> 32:52.586
...so you should figure out how
you feel about that beforehand.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.419
l... Oh, God!

32:54.589 --> 32:57.217
And then be ready to toss
that decision out the window...

32:57.392 --> 33:00.327
...when the pain really kicks in.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.561
A woman in labor
wouldn't even feel that.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.289
Good to know.

33:05.466 --> 33:06.455
Or that.

33:06.634 --> 33:07.896
This way.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.003
You squeamish, Ben?

33:10.505 --> 33:11.938
Little bit, I guess.

33:12.106 --> 33:15.007
You have to figure out if you're
gonna be in the delivery room.

33:15.176 --> 33:16.700
Oh, yeah, of course he will be.

33:16.878 --> 33:17.867
Yes.

33:18.046 --> 33:20.310
Some men are so traumatized
by the experience...

33:20.481 --> 33:23.450
...they can never look at their wives
the same again.

33:23.618 --> 33:25.142
Sexually, that is.

33:25.319 --> 33:27.981
Give me some slow, deep breaths.

33:28.156 --> 33:29.783
How many do you want to have?

33:29.957 --> 33:31.288
- Four?
- Two?

33:32.427 --> 33:34.861
Big push. Big push.

33:35.029 --> 33:37.190
I need an epidural!

33:37.532 --> 33:40.797
Look at her! She's breathing fine!

33:41.102 --> 33:42.296
What about me?

33:44.439 --> 33:46.964
They say for a man to experience
the equivalent pain...

33:47.141 --> 33:49.302
...you'd have to pull your scrotum
over your head.

33:50.478 --> 33:51.775
That was incredible.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.243
Glad you feel that way.

33:53.414 --> 33:55.905
Because now the real fun begins.

33:56.317 --> 33:58.046
Welcome to the world of parenting.

33:58.219 --> 34:01.382
- They breathe, they blink, they cry.
- And they're all yours.

34:01.856 --> 34:05.292
Congratulations, you've just had twins.

34:08.862 --> 34:11.161
Look at how their little chests
move up and down.

34:11.331 --> 34:14.699
Yeah. Their creepy little chests.

34:14.869 --> 34:17.667
And you really want four of these things?

34:18.206 --> 34:21.004
I think it'd be nice to have
a big family, don't you?

34:21.175 --> 34:23.438
Yeah. No, no, definitely.

34:23.610 --> 34:24.635
Well, I mean...

34:24.812 --> 34:27.474
...four might be kind of
a big commitment.

34:32.587 --> 34:35.420
Okay, do you want to take that?

34:35.790 --> 34:39.590
No, you can do it. Come on.

34:42.630 --> 34:44.495
Just pat him on the back really gently.

34:44.665 --> 34:45.927
Okay.

34:46.100 --> 34:47.658
Poor little baby.

34:47.835 --> 34:51.032
Little creepy robot baby.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.100
Oh, my God!

34:57.378 --> 34:59.505
- God.
- Hold on.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.679
- Here you go.
- Stop, stop.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.714
Hold on, hold on. There you go.

35:03.885 --> 35:06.080
- There's some on his shirt too.
- Okay.

35:06.254 --> 35:08.415
We can't forget to set the alarm for 8...

35:08.589 --> 35:11.422
...because we're going to Macy's
to register for the wedding.

35:11.592 --> 35:13.924
Wait, we're not bringing these
with us, are we?

35:14.095 --> 35:16.962
Come on, can't we just, like,
phone in our order or something?

35:17.131 --> 35:21.465
No, we're so jammed this week,
tomorrow's the only day we can do it.

35:25.840 --> 35:28.070
Look at that. Fell back asleep.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.173
So I did it.

35:30.344 --> 35:33.006
Looks like this parenting thing
isn't as hard as they say.

35:33.181 --> 35:34.978
See? You're a natural.

35:35.149 --> 35:36.138
Thanks.

35:36.317 --> 35:37.306
Night.

35:42.056 --> 35:45.025
Ben? Ben!

35:45.193 --> 35:46.956
Ben!

35:47.328 --> 35:48.488
Ben!

35:48.663 --> 35:50.722
Okay, I'm coming.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.661
What? Hi.

35:52.834 --> 35:55.598
How many times do I have to knock, man?
How you doing?

35:55.803 --> 35:57.065
- Good.
- Good morning.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.035
- Shelly's dad fell off a ladder.
- What?

35:59.207 --> 36:01.869
And unfortunately, he's gonna make it.
So we have to go...

36:02.043 --> 36:04.307
...and you are on brat patrol
for a couple hours.

36:04.478 --> 36:06.446
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Thanks a million.

36:13.221 --> 36:15.246
Hi.

36:15.857 --> 36:17.916
Which one's the biter?

36:18.092 --> 36:21.960
All you have to do is point the gun at
the item you want and then pull the trigger.

36:22.129 --> 36:25.997
The computer instantly logs it in our registry
database for your guests to consider.

36:26.167 --> 36:28.499
There's no limit to how many
items I can choose?

36:28.669 --> 36:30.694
- When in doubt, zap it.
- Great.

36:30.872 --> 36:32.499
We only have a couple hours so...

36:32.673 --> 36:35.039
Chop-chop. Come on.

36:35.776 --> 36:38.768
Okay. All right. Yep.

36:38.946 --> 36:40.777
Guys, guys, guys,
slow down, slow down.

36:40.948 --> 36:42.848
Hey. All right, that's good.

36:43.017 --> 36:46.544
Now we're going faster.
Stop, stop. Hello?

36:46.721 --> 36:47.983
All right, guys. All right.

36:48.155 --> 36:51.682
The yelling needs to hold off. All right.

36:52.393 --> 36:55.021
Hey, Ben, what do you like better?
The blue or the beige?

36:55.196 --> 36:56.788
The beige or the blue?

36:56.964 --> 36:59.398
- I like the blue. Blue's good.
- Beige goes better...

36:59.567 --> 37:00.795
...with the placemats.

37:01.235 --> 37:02.998
Or beige. Let's just do beige.

37:03.170 --> 37:04.637
I love beige.

37:05.239 --> 37:06.866
Beige it is.

37:16.183 --> 37:17.946
- Do you like this one?
- It's great.

37:18.119 --> 37:21.145
- All right, let's get this one.
- Yeah, let's get a couple.

37:23.791 --> 37:25.986
Oh, I just got this text message
from Carlisle.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.684
I got the wrong dinnerware.

37:27.862 --> 37:30.695
- Do you mean silverware? Can we just go?
- No, dinnerware.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.764
- No way. That is not simulated.
- God, that's bad.

37:37.772 --> 37:39.706
Well, why don't you change the diaper...

37:39.874 --> 37:41.466
...and I'll go get the dinnerware?

37:41.642 --> 37:44.270
- Why don't we think about...
- Okay.

37:48.649 --> 37:49.673
Okay.

38:24.151 --> 38:25.709
Yeah.

38:28.689 --> 38:30.782
Stop! Oh, God!

38:30.958 --> 38:33.119
Stop, stop!

38:34.295 --> 38:37.526
Should we get the 500-thread count?
Ben, can you slow down a little bit?

38:37.698 --> 38:39.791
Oh, I'm trying.

38:44.972 --> 38:46.371
Oh, my God.

38:46.540 --> 38:47.564
Sorry. Ben?

38:47.742 --> 38:49.676
- Give me one, please?
- Will you take that?

38:49.844 --> 38:51.311
I'm gonna give you one.

38:51.479 --> 38:54.846
- I will help you by getting this one thing...
- I'm sorry.

38:55.016 --> 38:56.711
Guys, guys, guys, it's okay.

38:58.552 --> 39:00.179
- Come here. Come on, come on.
- Okay.

39:00.354 --> 39:02.652
Ben, don't drop him!

39:02.823 --> 39:04.654
Here, take the kids. Come on, come on.

39:04.825 --> 39:06.315
Boys, let's go. Come on.

39:06.494 --> 39:09.725
Hi, I'm looking for some Pima cotton
or Egyptian cotton sheets.

39:09.897 --> 39:12.297
Something that really seems to breathe.
I'm sorry.

39:12.466 --> 39:15.697
I can't seem to find them over there
and I have...

39:15.870 --> 39:18.430
Get off the bed.
All right.

39:20.408 --> 39:21.875
Get off the bed.

39:22.043 --> 39:25.604
Enough. Okay, enough.
No, no. Okay. Stop!

39:25.780 --> 39:28.476
No, no, no.
Guys, no, no, no.

39:28.649 --> 39:32.346
Just stop. Sorry.
It's fine. It's just a...

39:32.520 --> 39:33.851
Stop.

39:35.990 --> 39:39.016
Stop it! Stop, you stupid... Shut up!

39:39.193 --> 39:44.460
Just shut up, shut up, shut up!
Shut up, shut up! Shut it! Shut it!

39:44.632 --> 39:47.226
- Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
- I'm sorry.

39:47.601 --> 39:49.660
Thank God. I've had a long day.

39:49.837 --> 39:52.305
These are fake. Watch. See?

39:54.275 --> 39:55.765
No, no, no, we're on our way.

39:55.943 --> 40:00.141
We just got a little detained at Macy's.
Well, Ben did.

40:00.314 --> 40:02.544
For being a public nuisance.

40:02.716 --> 40:04.707
It's a long story.

40:04.885 --> 40:08.116
Okay. Bye.

40:09.156 --> 40:10.453
Well, I'll tell you...

40:10.624 --> 40:13.616
...l'm a lot more prepared for kids now.

40:14.095 --> 40:15.153
Like way more.

40:15.329 --> 40:18.958
Why are there 56 bras on here?

40:38.419 --> 40:40.819
Pour a glass of that for yourself.
Have a glass.

40:40.988 --> 40:44.651
All right, I got it. This is it.
You, my dear, look amazing.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.358
I can't believe all these cheeses.

40:48.529 --> 40:51.020
I know.
I don't even know which to start with.

40:51.198 --> 40:53.826
- There are so many.
- It's funny. Cheez Whiz or Velveeta.

40:54.001 --> 40:56.970
That's about as complicated
as my cheese dilemmas usually get.

40:57.138 --> 41:00.369
I think I prefer the nutty
Comté Saint-Antoine, which is this one.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.805
- All right, this is it?
- From the Basque region...

41:02.977 --> 41:05.878
...and go.
Gonna change your life.

41:06.046 --> 41:09.948
- Oh, my God. Carlisle.
- Oh, my God. Carlisle. Wait a minute.

41:10.117 --> 41:13.609
Ben, Carlisle's totally right.
I mean, this nutty cheese is the way to go.

41:13.787 --> 41:15.652
It's so good. You have to try it.

41:15.823 --> 41:19.657
- The white one? Good.
- You were right. You recommended it too.

41:20.861 --> 41:22.954
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey!

41:23.697 --> 41:26.495
Every time I hear the word
"cheese us," I'm in.

41:26.667 --> 41:28.157
Praise Gouda.

41:30.004 --> 41:32.404
Look at all of you,
you're all dressed to the nines.

41:32.573 --> 41:34.598
Oh, Lindsey, you look fabulous.

41:34.775 --> 41:37.573
- Oh, thank you.
- How's life after the big D?

41:39.146 --> 41:40.374
That bad, huh?

41:40.648 --> 41:42.946
Men are a little too hard to train so...

41:43.117 --> 41:47.554
Thought I'd stop trying
and live vicariously through Ben's training.

41:49.523 --> 41:51.616
Here I was thinking I was
already housebroken.

41:51.792 --> 41:52.781
Maybe not.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.188
- Cute.
- It's refreshing...

41:54.361 --> 41:56.386
...how honest you are.
It doesn't happen...

41:56.564 --> 41:58.759
...that easily for a lot of in-laws.
- Really?

41:58.933 --> 42:02.027
Because I feel like we all
get along really well.

42:02.203 --> 42:04.865
You know what, Ben is a wonderful
addition to this family.

42:05.039 --> 42:06.506
Wow, thank you.

42:06.674 --> 42:08.539
Whatever.
There's a little awkwardness...

42:08.709 --> 42:10.836
...but nothing more
than just new family stuff.

42:11.011 --> 42:13.639
You know a great way around
new family awkwardness?

42:13.814 --> 42:16.112
- Word association.
- Excuse me?

42:16.283 --> 42:18.410
It's fun, really. You go around the table...

42:18.586 --> 42:21.555
...and you pick one word that best
describes each in-law...

42:21.722 --> 42:23.815
...then they pick one word
that describes you.

42:23.991 --> 42:29.088
- A give and take, kind of an icebreaker...
- I think it sounds so fun. I love games.

42:29.263 --> 42:30.753
That's the spirit, Grandma.

42:30.931 --> 42:32.762
Ben, start with Grandma.

42:32.933 --> 42:36.562
One word to describe Grandma.

42:37.371 --> 42:40.602
That word would be...

42:40.774 --> 42:42.332
...wisdom.

42:42.509 --> 42:43.669
Excellent.

42:43.844 --> 42:45.709
Grandma. What about Ben?

42:46.680 --> 42:48.477
Peculiar for his age.

42:48.649 --> 42:51.140
Let's just try and stick with one word.

42:51.385 --> 42:54.479
- I'd just say peculiar.
- Okay.

42:54.655 --> 42:56.987
We have a winner.
Game over. I think.

42:57.157 --> 43:00.217
- No, no, come on. What about Lindsey?
- I don't wanna do it.

43:00.394 --> 43:02.954
Don't think.
What's the first word comes to your mind?

43:03.130 --> 43:04.791
Go for it.

43:06.033 --> 43:07.466
Blond.

43:07.635 --> 43:09.034
- Are you kidding me?
- Golden.

43:09.203 --> 43:12.798
No, gold. No, like you exude gold.
Not dumb, though.

43:12.973 --> 43:15.669
- I didn't say dumb.
- You didn't say dumb. You said blond.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.572
Okay. Blond Lindsey.

43:17.745 --> 43:20.680
Oh, my tur... Okay, awesome!
Yes, okay, so...

43:22.349 --> 43:24.078
Assertive.

43:24.551 --> 43:28.453
If you need someone to take the bull
by the horns, Ben's your guy.

43:29.723 --> 43:31.247
That's a good one.
Not that good.

43:31.425 --> 43:34.485
I mean, she's laughing a little
too hard for it, but good joke.

43:36.096 --> 43:38.360
This is terrific.
See how you're breaking the ice?

43:38.532 --> 43:41.092
There's something new happening now.
Take a shot at Dad.

43:41.268 --> 43:43.133
- There we go.
- Sadie's dad is...

43:43.304 --> 43:44.362
He's outgoing.

43:44.538 --> 43:47.666
- Outgoing, like saying "nice."
- That's very fitting.

43:47.841 --> 43:49.536
You're not shedding any light.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.837
- Come on, you can do better than this.
- Yes.

43:52.012 --> 43:53.445
- Let it rip.
- No, no, no.

43:53.614 --> 43:56.242
- No, don't push me. I'm not gonna...
- He's asking, Ben.

43:56.417 --> 43:57.782
- Go, come on.
- All right.

43:59.486 --> 44:00.748
What about pompous?

44:00.921 --> 44:05.187
- I'm a little pompous.
- What's the <i>Wizard of Oz</i> thing? Pompous.

44:05.793 --> 44:07.090
No, I was just kidding.

44:07.261 --> 44:11.459
No. No, no, no.
It's all right. I asked for it.

44:11.632 --> 44:15.466
I just meant somebody likes
to hear the sound of their own voice.

44:15.836 --> 44:17.326
Now you're getting interesting.

44:17.504 --> 44:19.096
Pompous dad, back at Ben.

44:19.273 --> 44:21.241
- Here it is.
- Okay.

44:21.875 --> 44:24.241
- How about vanilla?
- Whoa, mom!

44:24.411 --> 44:25.901
Called you vanilla.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.344
Could be bland, I'm not sure,
but it's your call.

44:28.515 --> 44:32.884
- Back at mom. Come on, Ben.
- Okay, "Stepford-y." Stepfordy.

44:33.053 --> 44:35.851
Stepfordy? Is that an adjective?

44:36.023 --> 44:37.718
Yeah, it just describes, you know:

44:37.891 --> 44:41.452
"Let's just sweep everything under the rug
with a pat on the back, a smile...

44:41.628 --> 44:44.620
...and don't forget the glass of champagne
to take the edge off."

44:44.798 --> 44:46.197
You're on a roll. Come on.

44:46.367 --> 44:49.063
Do we have any problems here?
If we did, we'd just...

44:49.236 --> 44:54.230
...throw some money at it because we
all know there's nothing money can't buy.

44:57.945 --> 45:00.106
Can't buy communication like this.

45:01.682 --> 45:05.118
<i>Hey, Ben, I thought you were</i>
<i>really great with my family today.</i>

45:05.285 --> 45:06.582
Are you making fun of me?

45:06.754 --> 45:08.847
No. No. Course not.

45:09.022 --> 45:10.182
It sounded like you were.

45:10.357 --> 45:12.484
I'm not making fun of you.
The fact that you...

45:12.659 --> 45:15.651
...lost your mind and embarrassed yourself
in front of everyone.

45:15.829 --> 45:18.730
No, that's not making fun of anyone.

45:21.568 --> 45:24.128
- Okay.
- What?

45:24.405 --> 45:26.873
- Time for a punishment. Come here.
- No.

45:30.444 --> 45:31.433
<i>What are you doing?</i>

45:31.612 --> 45:35.104
- <i>What does it look like I'm doing?</i>
- <i>Something that's very against the rules.</i>

45:35.282 --> 45:36.806
Mayday.

45:42.823 --> 45:44.814
Hi. Just in the neighborhood...

45:44.992 --> 45:47.358
...thought I'd drop by,
make a little house call.

45:47.528 --> 45:48.961
Yeah, of course you were.

45:49.129 --> 45:51.757
- Am I interrupting anything?
- No, no, no. Come on in.

45:51.932 --> 45:54.423
- Oh, thanks. Yay.
- Come on in.

45:54.601 --> 45:57.968
- Hi.
- I won't overstay my welcome.

45:58.505 --> 46:01.099
I just wanted to check
and see if everything was okay...

46:01.275 --> 46:05.041
...because after the tasting,
things were a little tense with the in-laws.

46:05.212 --> 46:07.043
Nope. No tension here.

46:07.881 --> 46:09.348
Can I be frank?

46:09.516 --> 46:11.040
Of course, I'm Frank.

46:11.218 --> 46:13.015
Pardon the pun...

46:13.187 --> 46:16.384
...but at this stage in the course,
I usually find out that...

46:16.557 --> 46:19.720
...a lot of couples resort to sex
as a quick fix for their problems.

46:19.893 --> 46:23.090
I just wanna make sure you're
strong enough to resist the temptation.

46:23.263 --> 46:26.027
- Yeah. We are.
- Yeah.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.532
Does that make you uncomfortable, Ben?

46:28.902 --> 46:32.030
No, I'm not uncomfortable
talking about sex, no.

46:32.206 --> 46:34.504
Having you in my living room
talking about sex...

46:34.675 --> 46:37.769
...that makes me a little uncomfortable.
Yeah.

46:37.945 --> 46:40.106
The number one rule of a good sex life...

46:40.280 --> 46:42.009
...is not being so serious.

46:42.182 --> 46:43.444
You know, because...

46:43.617 --> 46:45.812
...if the humor goes,
there goes the intimacy...

46:45.986 --> 46:48.853
...and then there goes the marriage,
then divorce, yada, yada.

46:49.256 --> 46:51.224
But there is a remedy.

46:51.391 --> 46:54.258
Knowing what your partner likes sexually.
How do you find out?

46:54.428 --> 46:57.226
Well, you ask. That's kind of wonderful.

46:57.397 --> 47:00.230
Hey, one little exercise,
then I'm Audi 5000, okay?

47:00.801 --> 47:01.825
Ben.

47:02.002 --> 47:04.334
Look at Sadie
and complete this sentence:

47:04.505 --> 47:06.632
"I like it when..."

47:10.777 --> 47:14.338
- This is ridiculous. I'm not doing it.
- It's not, Ben. Come on, I wanna know.

47:14.515 --> 47:16.779
I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't wanna do it.

47:16.950 --> 47:18.417
I wanna know.

47:19.052 --> 47:20.781
Please.

47:22.623 --> 47:24.488
Sadie.

47:25.492 --> 47:29.019
I really like it when...

47:29.596 --> 47:31.860
...Reverend Frank doesn't
interrupt us before sex.

47:32.032 --> 47:33.761
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

47:33.934 --> 47:35.492
- Okay.
- That's okay.

47:35.669 --> 47:38.536
You're not comfortable with this,
let's show him how to do it.

47:38.705 --> 47:41.833
- Don't hold back.
- I like it when it's out of the ordinary...

47:42.009 --> 47:43.408
...personally.

47:43.577 --> 47:47.274
That's weird, because I always pictured you
as a kind of in-the-bedroom person.

47:47.447 --> 47:51.349
- No, not really. No.
- Hi! Whoa! Out of the ordinary?

47:51.518 --> 47:52.746
We're out of the ordinary.

47:52.920 --> 47:56.549
Because I remember having sex
on this carpet and I got a rug burn.

47:56.723 --> 47:57.951
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.592
One time, though.
It was great...

47:59.760 --> 48:01.819
...but it's more the exception
than the rule.

48:01.995 --> 48:04.623
- I'm talking about, like, real spontaneity.
- Like what?

48:04.798 --> 48:06.959
Like my parents' bathroom?

48:07.134 --> 48:09.398
Oh, yeah, and everyone's
downstairs having dinner.

48:09.570 --> 48:11.970
- Exactly. Or on the beach.
- Under a towel.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.607
- At work.
- In the office supply room.

48:14.775 --> 48:18.506
Or maybe at your grandmother's house
while she's in the kitchen making tea.

48:18.679 --> 48:20.442
Yes! I love it when you get creative.

48:20.647 --> 48:23.013
You have no idea.
I love it when you take control.

48:23.183 --> 48:24.548
What do you like about that?

48:24.718 --> 48:27.152
Okay! That's enough of that!

48:27.321 --> 48:29.289
Ben, come on. This is just an exercise.

48:29.456 --> 48:31.356
- We were talking through it. Yes!
- No. No.

48:31.525 --> 48:34.153
Sadie.
Pushups, that's an exercise.

48:34.895 --> 48:37.159
No. No, I see
Ben's point of view here.

48:37.331 --> 48:39.060
Maybe we're rushing things a bit.

48:39.232 --> 48:41.700
Maybe I should pencil in
the date two years from now.

48:41.902 --> 48:44.462
- Okay.
- Sorry to bother you. Good night.

48:44.638 --> 48:50.235
I'll let myself out. I know the way.
You have a good night. I'm going out now.

48:50.410 --> 48:53.004
- What was that?
- Please.

48:53.180 --> 48:54.169
Reverend Frank!

48:55.716 --> 48:57.343
So we back on schedule?

48:57.517 --> 48:59.951
He's a reverend.
What did you think was gonna happen?

49:00.120 --> 49:03.021
Well, I can't believe you were
talking to him like that.

49:03.190 --> 49:08.753
I can't believe the first man to actually ask
me what I like in bed was my minister.

49:26.278 --> 49:27.472
Son of a...

49:47.066 --> 49:52.003
Hey, get your butt out the way!
This ain't no damn pedestrian crossing!

49:52.171 --> 49:54.366
So you're telling me
he bugged your apartment?

49:54.540 --> 49:56.508
Yes.
And who knows what he heard?

49:56.675 --> 49:59.542
I mean, this guy is sick,
and I can't wait to tell Sadie.

49:59.712 --> 50:02.078
- She's gonna freak out.
- You cannot tell Sadie.

50:02.248 --> 50:05.342
You think she's gonna believe her
reverend is bugging your bedroom?

50:05.517 --> 50:07.246
Of course she will. I have evidence.

50:07.419 --> 50:09.114
Does this bug have his name on it?

50:09.288 --> 50:11.085
No. But...

50:11.590 --> 50:12.614
All right.

50:12.791 --> 50:15.055
We can talk about this later
if you need to focus.

50:15.227 --> 50:18.094
I'm good. This is about you.
Lady in the wheelchair, please!

50:18.831 --> 50:20.025
Listen.

50:20.199 --> 50:22.531
The lines of communication
have to be shut down...

50:22.701 --> 50:26.137
...between you and your woman.
She trusts the reverend completely now.

50:26.305 --> 50:28.603
She trusts him so much
she's calling Shelly...

50:28.774 --> 50:32.107
...and telling her how we need
to take a course to help our marriage.

50:32.511 --> 50:34.843
So I'm supposed to take this lying down?

50:35.014 --> 50:38.108
No. Look, let me make this simple, okay?

50:38.317 --> 50:41.718
We have to punch a hole in Frank's
holier-than-thou armor.

50:41.887 --> 50:46.688
We have to find his deepest,
darkest secret and take him down.

50:47.593 --> 50:49.220
Roach coach.

50:50.262 --> 50:52.230
Roach coach!

51:19.858 --> 51:21.587
I'm not doing that. I'm not doing it.

51:21.760 --> 51:24.251
Thrust, thrust.

51:26.231 --> 51:29.530
All right, I know you're gonna find
something you like with this group.

51:29.702 --> 51:32.068
See, this is just what I gravitate towards.

51:32.237 --> 51:35.695
- Really simple.
- And no diamond? I'm fine with that.

51:39.545 --> 51:40.739
Split up?

51:41.947 --> 51:43.676
Come apart.

52:42.941 --> 52:43.930
Excuse me.

52:44.109 --> 52:46.669
Hi. I'm just here to pick up my rings.

52:46.845 --> 52:49.609
- Last name's Murphy.
- Murphy.

52:50.749 --> 52:52.774
- Okay, there you go.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

52:52.951 --> 52:54.816
Let's take a look.

52:54.987 --> 52:56.249
Oh, wow.

52:56.422 --> 52:58.413
- They're really beauti...
- Thank you.

52:59.792 --> 53:02.818
I'm sorry, does that say "Never to fart"?

53:03.028 --> 53:05.155
That's what you wrote
on your inscription form.

53:05.330 --> 53:07.264
I'm sorry, I wrote "Never to part."

53:07.433 --> 53:09.298
I don't know who would've
written "fart."

53:09.468 --> 53:12.164
- That's ridiculous.
- We get pretty strange requests here...

53:12.337 --> 53:16.774
...and we just engrave whatever is written,
and there you go.

53:16.942 --> 53:19.706
- Yep. "Never to part."
- "Never to fart."

53:21.246 --> 53:23.237
- No, that's a P.
- It's an F, sir.

53:23.415 --> 53:27.010
Nope, that's a P. Do you see how
that comes around in a P way?

53:27.419 --> 53:28.511
- Judith?
- Yes?

53:28.687 --> 53:31.212
Could you come over here
just for a tiny little second?

53:31.390 --> 53:32.823
Thank you. Judith...

53:32.991 --> 53:35.289
- Sure.
- What is this letter there?

53:36.829 --> 53:38.854
- That is an F.
- No, that's a P.

53:39.031 --> 53:40.999
It's a P.
It comes around like a P.

53:41.166 --> 53:44.067
Well, actually, if you look,
there's clearly a gap in the curl.

53:44.236 --> 53:46.568
There's no gap in the curl.
Judith? It connects.

53:46.738 --> 53:48.137
That's a P. "Never to part."

53:48.307 --> 53:51.174
- Mark, could you just come...
- I don't know that we need Mark.

53:51.343 --> 53:53.208
...a little quick second here?

53:53.378 --> 53:56.040
- And what is that?
- Oh, the novelty inscription, yes.

53:56.215 --> 53:59.582
Mark, it's not a novelty inscription.
It's a romantic inscription.

53:59.751 --> 54:01.548
Excuse me.
What is this letter?

54:01.720 --> 54:06.555
- It's an F. I do teach penmanship.
- I took his class. It's wonderful.

54:07.059 --> 54:08.720
- It's pretty clearly an F.
- Yeah.

54:08.894 --> 54:09.883
Excuse me, excuse me.

54:10.062 --> 54:12.223
Hi. I'm really sorry
to bother you. Very nice.

54:12.397 --> 54:17.096
Could I ask you to help us out with
a problem here, just a little problem?

54:17.269 --> 54:19.328
Could we show the normal person?
Thank you.

54:19.505 --> 54:24.807
What would you call the letter between
the fingers that I'm pointing at right there?

54:25.077 --> 54:26.669
- What is that?
- An F?

54:26.845 --> 54:29.279
- I'm sorry, sir? Louder, please?
- An F?

54:29.448 --> 54:30.437
- F.
- Yes.

54:30.616 --> 54:33.779
- That's right.
- Okay, excuse me. Hi. All right.

54:33.952 --> 54:35.920
I'm getting married in two days.

54:36.088 --> 54:38.886
Thank you.
I really need that to say "Never to part."

54:39.057 --> 54:41.719
- That's very nice.
- "Never to part." That's so sweet.

54:41.894 --> 54:43.054
And that's what I wrote.

54:43.228 --> 54:46.356
I need it to say "Never to part,"
and I need it done immediately.

54:46.532 --> 54:49.365
So how do we do that?
How do we get that done?

54:49.535 --> 54:51.526
We could have it tomorrow.
In the morning.

54:51.703 --> 54:53.603
Great.
And that's what we can do.

54:53.772 --> 54:55.364
But there's a $250 rush fee.

54:55.541 --> 54:58.942
So I'm spending $250 on something
I asked you to do in the first place?

54:59.111 --> 55:00.669
And we can guarantee that.

55:03.282 --> 55:05.580
This is ridiculous. There's nothing here.

55:05.751 --> 55:07.309
Oh, come on, man.

55:07.486 --> 55:10.284
If that old lady from
<i>Murder, She Wrote</i> can do this...

55:10.455 --> 55:12.980
...then we can find something.

55:13.158 --> 55:16.321
- Are you talking about Angela L...
- Just keep looking.

55:18.497 --> 55:19.486
What is that?

55:19.665 --> 55:21.633
Frank Littleton. That's his address.

55:23.202 --> 55:25.830
But who's Maria Gonzales?

55:51.630 --> 55:53.120
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Joel, it's Ben.

55:53.298 --> 55:54.822
There's no one here by that name.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.491
Is there another name
you'd maybe like to try?

55:57.669 --> 55:59.261
Eagle, it's Sapphire.

55:59.438 --> 56:01.269
Copy that, Sapphire.
What's your 20?

56:01.440 --> 56:02.907
I'm at John the Baptist's house.

56:03.375 --> 56:05.104
- <i>What's he doing?</i>
- He's showering.

56:05.744 --> 56:07.769
Dude, you're watching
him take a shower?

56:07.946 --> 56:09.174
No, I'm outside.

56:09.681 --> 56:11.114
Then get your butt inside.

56:11.283 --> 56:14.946
- What? Are you nuts? I'm gonna get caught.
- Listen, the rehearsal's tomorrow.

56:15.120 --> 56:17.179
You've only got today to blow the lid off.

56:17.356 --> 56:18.550
It's your only chance.

56:18.724 --> 56:22.125
Strike first, strike hard. No mercy.

56:29.768 --> 56:31.030
What the hell am I doing?

56:50.222 --> 56:51.587
Stop!

57:23.121 --> 57:24.588
Maria Gonzales.

57:30.762 --> 57:31.786
I got you, sucker M.C.

57:38.403 --> 57:40.803
Hi.

57:41.073 --> 57:43.405
Wow, look at you...

57:43.575 --> 57:45.702
...priest dog.

57:47.679 --> 57:49.704
Hi.

57:49.881 --> 57:51.075
I'm gonna...

57:51.249 --> 57:52.682
No. No, no!

58:00.292 --> 58:02.192
That's so gross.

58:10.235 --> 58:11.463
Nicodemus!

58:11.636 --> 58:13.365
Nicodemus!

58:13.739 --> 58:15.730
No, no, no, no!

58:16.274 --> 58:17.332
Nicodemus.

58:17.509 --> 58:19.500
Leave Mr. Socks alone.

58:19.678 --> 58:22.340
Nicodemus! Bad Nicodemus!

58:22.514 --> 58:25.415
These are my Cheesy Curls.
No, don't you run away.

58:25.617 --> 58:28.950
Bad. These are mine.

58:29.254 --> 58:32.087
This is good.
Things are really good.

58:32.257 --> 58:36.387
And I'm not even concerned with the fact
that Ben hasn't written his vows yet.

58:36.561 --> 58:39.121
- Really?
- No.

58:39.297 --> 58:45.099
He's just drawn this little animated truck
going through a hoop of fire.

58:45.804 --> 58:47.396
You know what?

58:47.639 --> 58:49.072
It's actually better.

58:49.241 --> 58:51.300
Because he's waiting
until the last second...

58:51.476 --> 58:55.913
...when his mind is completely clear
and he can just say what he really means.

58:56.882 --> 58:59.373
- Okay, hold on.
- What do we think? What's the verdict?

58:59.551 --> 59:01.678
Let's just take a second.

59:01.853 --> 59:03.787
Honestly?

59:05.390 --> 59:07.950
Looks a little bit like the inside
of a down comforter.

59:10.562 --> 59:12.052
What the hell's going on?

59:12.230 --> 59:13.561
But look, no, the rhinest...

59:13.732 --> 59:16.758
- It's beautiful, honestly...
- No. I'm not talking about the dress.

59:16.935 --> 59:19.665
I'm talking about Ben.
An animated truck?

59:19.838 --> 59:22.830
You know, I wrote seven pages
on how much I love and adore him...

59:23.008 --> 59:27.911
...and all he can muster up for me is some
stupid Tonka truck in a three-ring circus?

59:28.079 --> 59:30.639
- That's it?
- Okay, you know what?

59:31.316 --> 59:32.578
Lay it on me.

59:32.751 --> 59:34.946
Oh, God.

59:35.120 --> 59:37.520
Please tell me everything's gonna be fine.

59:38.490 --> 59:40.151
What do you want me to say?

59:40.826 --> 59:43.124
Sadie, my marriage failed.

59:43.762 --> 59:47.425
I watch <i>Titanic</i> by myself, alone,
in my room, every night...

59:47.599 --> 59:49.965
...stuffing my face
with Honey BBQ Fritos.

59:50.836 --> 59:54.101
Not the one to give you any tips or advice
about your relationship...

59:54.272 --> 59:56.604
...no matter how desperate you are.

59:56.775 --> 59:58.242
Sorry.

59:58.977 --> 01:00:05.007
However, I do recall my ex
never wrote any vows at all.

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:07.113
Really?

01:00:08.019 --> 01:00:09.452
That's kind of promising.

01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:10.610
Yeah.

01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:12.916
It was probably because he was
too busy...

01:00:13.091 --> 01:00:16.891
...sleeping with our dental hygienist,
which was great.

01:00:17.729 --> 01:00:20.289
Hey, but your hygienist is a guy, right?

01:00:20.465 --> 01:00:22.023
Yeah.

01:00:23.034 --> 01:00:24.194
You're fine.

01:00:38.283 --> 01:00:41.377
Is this a piece of work?
They don't make them like this any more.

01:00:41.786 --> 01:00:43.276
When two people say "I do"...

01:00:43.455 --> 01:00:46.322
...they're putting their lives
in each other's hands entirely.

01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:48.959
Anything less than that
is doomed to failure.

01:00:49.127 --> 01:00:51.254
Now, the last test you have to pass...

01:00:51.429 --> 01:00:53.761
...before I certify you
ready for marriage...

01:00:53.932 --> 01:00:56.059
...is the communication test.

01:00:56.835 --> 01:00:58.462
Which is very important...

01:00:58.637 --> 01:01:01.936
...given how poorly we've been doing
in that area lately.

01:01:02.107 --> 01:01:03.199
Oh, me? Don't worry.

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:05.070
I plan on communicating very well...

01:01:05.243 --> 01:01:08.474
Okay, Ben, can you please
just let him finish talking?

01:01:08.647 --> 01:01:10.239
- Thank you.
- Yep.

01:01:12.584 --> 01:01:14.916
- Sorry, reverend.
- It's okay.

01:01:15.086 --> 01:01:18.681
To demonstrate how important
communication is in that area:

01:01:20.458 --> 01:01:22.153
- What?
- Blindfold.

01:01:23.228 --> 01:01:25.492
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

01:01:25.664 --> 01:01:28.155
You're gonna be Sadie's eyes
as she drives us.

01:01:28.366 --> 01:01:31.824
- You're insane!
- lf you wanna pass this course...

01:01:32.003 --> 01:01:34.597
...and get married tomorrow,
you have to pass this test.

01:01:34.773 --> 01:01:35.933
Your call.

01:01:36.107 --> 01:01:40.271
- Yeah. Yeah. I can do this.
- You <i>'</i> re actually gonna go through with this?

01:01:40.979 --> 01:01:44.847
- What, Ben, you don't think I can do this?
- Okay. Maybe you don't understand...

01:01:45.016 --> 01:01:46.142
...what's going on here.

01:01:46.318 --> 01:01:48.582
Ben, there's two sets of controls.

01:01:48.753 --> 01:01:50.778
I can take over at any time.

01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:54.281
What'll it be, Benjamin?

01:01:54.459 --> 01:01:55.653
Yeah.

01:01:56.461 --> 01:01:58.656
Well, I'm gonna need
a little help here, though.

01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:00.388
First you need to put it in gear.

01:02:00.565 --> 01:02:02.465
- Check.
- And then you're gonna ease out...

01:02:02.634 --> 01:02:03.862
...onto the street.

01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:10.000
Left. Left!

01:02:10.175 --> 01:02:12.803
There you are. Right.
To the right!

01:02:12.978 --> 01:02:15.208
Ben, did you see a clipboard back there?

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.371
There it is. Least it's warm.

01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:19.380
- What...?
- It <i>'</i> s a communication exercise.

01:02:19.551 --> 01:02:21.519
You will be graded.
Less than 80 percent...

01:02:21.686 --> 01:02:23.517
...consider getting married in Vegas.

01:02:23.688 --> 01:02:25.918
You know what?
Vegas sounds awesome right now.

01:02:26.091 --> 01:02:28.525
Maybe you can get an
Elvis impersonator to officiate.

01:02:28.693 --> 01:02:30.058
"Hey, my wife. Yeah."

01:02:34.766 --> 01:02:37.894
- Ben, you wanna help your future bride?
- Yep, yep, yeah. I do, I do.

01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:40.401
How about we take a right?
Head back to the church.

01:02:40.572 --> 01:02:42.233
You might wanna brake.
Anytime.

01:02:44.409 --> 01:02:46.707
Sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I got nervous.

01:02:46.878 --> 01:02:49.608
That's very good.
Taking responsibility. Excellent, Sadie.

01:02:49.781 --> 01:02:51.248
More enthusiasm
in the back, Ben.

01:02:51.416 --> 01:02:54.749
Oh, my God, I'm having so much fun!
Aren <i>'</i> t you? I might pee my pants.

01:02:54.919 --> 01:02:56.910
Sarcasm, wicked stepsister
of communication.

01:02:57.088 --> 01:02:58.680
- Point off.
- Now take a right. Now.

01:02:58.857 --> 01:03:00.324
- A right? Now?
- Now!

01:03:02.627 --> 01:03:03.651
It's a one-way street!

01:03:03.828 --> 01:03:05.523
Okay, well, then should I pull over?

01:03:05.697 --> 01:03:08.063
No, no. Just go straight.
They'll go around you.

01:03:08.233 --> 01:03:11.498
Oh, my... Jesus. Okay, okay.

01:03:11.703 --> 01:03:16.504
- In about 20 yards we're gonna turn.
- 20 yards means nothing to me. I can <i>'</i> t see.

01:03:16.675 --> 01:03:19.109
Here we go. Turning now!

01:03:20.211 --> 01:03:23.578
There's a man.
That's an old man in a hat and a thing.

01:03:23.748 --> 01:03:25.272
Look out!

01:03:28.153 --> 01:03:30.815
- I'm blind, Ben!
- That's enough. We're ending this. Stop!

01:03:30.989 --> 01:03:33.116
Is that what you do
when things get difficult?

01:03:33.291 --> 01:03:34.758
You're just gonna quit?

01:03:34.926 --> 01:03:36.359
I need to count on you, Ben.

01:03:36.528 --> 01:03:39.929
Life will hand you stress
and the key to managing your anxiety...

01:03:40.098 --> 01:03:43.431
...is not letting it contaminate your partner.
- Garbage truck!

01:03:44.436 --> 01:03:45.596
- Where?
- Punch it!

01:03:48.406 --> 01:03:49.771
Yeah!

01:03:51.443 --> 01:03:53.843
I <i>'</i> m pretty sure I <i>'</i> m not learning
anything from this.

01:03:54.012 --> 01:03:56.276
- Are we good? Are we good?
- There's Burt Fleeger!

01:03:56.448 --> 01:03:57.938
Looking good, Hollywood!

01:03:58.116 --> 01:04:02.052
- I feel like I'm not getting any guidance.
- You might wanna pick up speed a little.

01:04:02.253 --> 01:04:05.620
- Wait, wait. Why would we do that?
- There's a parking space up there.

01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:07.587
Gun it, Sadie.

01:04:12.464 --> 01:04:14.329
- I never get this space!
- Oh, my God!

01:04:14.499 --> 01:04:16.296
Perfect.

01:04:18.169 --> 01:04:19.966
Hello, Jones family. How's it going?

01:04:20.138 --> 01:04:21.662
Hello, reverend.

01:04:22.107 --> 01:04:23.768
Daughter's a good little driver.

01:04:27.145 --> 01:04:31.013
Well, you have the wedding processional.
You can go with Mendelssohn...

01:04:31.182 --> 01:04:34.845
...or one couple actually had Captain and
Tennille here playing "Muskrat Love."

01:04:35.019 --> 01:04:37.681
It's your call.
After you boogie down the aisle...

01:04:37.856 --> 01:04:40.154
...l'll start by saying something nice.

01:04:40.325 --> 01:04:43.351
Speaking of that, let's give a big
Saint Augustine welcome...

01:04:43.528 --> 01:04:47.191
...to Ben Murphy's parents,
Ron and Mary Murphy.

01:04:47.499 --> 01:04:48.966
Came all the way from Seattle.

01:04:49.134 --> 01:04:53.264
Then I get into a brief message about
the joy and the sanctity of marriage...

01:04:53.438 --> 01:04:56.202
...and that on your honeymoon,
try and act surprised.

01:04:56.374 --> 01:04:58.137
It's an old joke, but sometimes works.

01:04:58.309 --> 01:05:00.140
Then we got prayer, hymn, prayer, hymn.

01:05:00.311 --> 01:05:03.109
And then we get into the vows.

01:05:03.281 --> 01:05:06.114
In my course, the couple
writes their own vows.

01:05:06.284 --> 01:05:08.115
And that in mind, may I have your vows?

01:05:08.686 --> 01:05:10.711
Thank you.

01:05:11.489 --> 01:05:13.286
Thank you.

01:05:15.059 --> 01:05:16.356
- Ben?
- Yeah.

01:05:16.528 --> 01:05:17.654
Got the vows?

01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:19.729
Ben, where are your vows?

01:05:20.098 --> 01:05:21.258
Oh, I have them. I just...

01:05:21.432 --> 01:05:24.401
I haven't finished them, but I will
have them here tomorrow.

01:05:25.503 --> 01:05:28.563
Okey-dokey.
Well, I guess that'll have to do for now.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.072
After the vows,
we have the lighting of the candle.

01:05:31.242 --> 01:05:34.075
- It's true, by the way.
- Not now, Ben. I just wanna think.

01:05:34.279 --> 01:05:35.405
Thinking's good.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.878
- Yes, I wanna think about everything.
- What about?

01:05:38.049 --> 01:05:40.142
I'm guessing these aren't
part of the vows.

01:05:40.318 --> 01:05:45.756
Okay, because I used to think that we were
so perfectly compatible for each other...

01:05:45.924 --> 01:05:47.755
...and now...

01:05:48.326 --> 01:05:49.486
- Look at us, Ben.
- What?

01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:53.256
- Ben, you want two kids, and I want four.
- So what?

01:05:53.431 --> 01:05:56.628
You obviously think my family
is a bunch of rich, alcoholic snobs.

01:05:56.801 --> 01:06:00.237
- You never take the lead on things, Ben!
- And I'm not good enough for you!

01:06:00.438 --> 01:06:02.929
I'm not adventurous enough in bed, right?

01:06:03.107 --> 01:06:05.632
And I'm not as handsome as Carlisle,
not as successful.

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:07.869
Carlisle has nothing to do with it.

01:06:08.046 --> 01:06:10.537
- Carlisle has everything to do with it.
- How?

01:06:10.715 --> 01:06:14.242
Because he is someone whose opinion
you trust way more than mine.

01:06:14.419 --> 01:06:17.786
Oh, God. When have I
ever said that to you, Ben?

01:06:17.956 --> 01:06:19.048
You just don't have to.

01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:21.053
"Carlisle, what crystal should we use?

01:06:21.226 --> 01:06:24.559
What brand of cheese is good, Carlisle?"

01:06:24.729 --> 01:06:27.562
God, I am so sick of you
choosing Carlisle's cheese.

01:06:27.732 --> 01:06:32.499
- Carlisle's cheese. Explore that, Ben.
- Enough of the pop psychology, reverend.

01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:37.107
Because all you've done is everything
you can to make sure this doesn't work.

01:06:37.275 --> 01:06:41.234
I've worked very hard to create lines
of communication between you and Sadie...

01:06:41.412 --> 01:06:43.607
...to let you know what you're in for.

01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:45.214
- You're onto it.
- Yeah, we are.

01:06:45.383 --> 01:06:47.851
We are discovering
a whole shitload right now!

01:06:48.019 --> 01:06:49.646
- Really?
- Yes, we are, Ben.

01:06:49.854 --> 01:06:52.880
- Guys, seriously, space, please.
- Now's the time. Pop the info.

01:06:53.057 --> 01:06:55.252
Okay. Okay. You know what?

01:06:55.426 --> 01:06:57.894
I didn't wanna have to do this,
but I have no choice.

01:06:58.062 --> 01:07:01.122
So aside from the fact that
Reverend Frank bugged our apartment...

01:07:01.299 --> 01:07:02.357
Excuse me, what?

01:07:02.533 --> 01:07:04.501
I've mounted an investigation.

01:07:04.669 --> 01:07:07.263
One that I think you would be
interested to hear about.

01:07:07.438 --> 01:07:11.067
So Frankie, should I tell them
or should you?

01:07:12.443 --> 01:07:14.070
What do you want me to tell them?

01:07:14.245 --> 01:07:17.180
What I want you to tell them
is what their good and decent...

01:07:17.348 --> 01:07:21.682
...and ever-so-intuitive reverend
was doing when he married...

01:07:21.853 --> 01:07:25.289
...and then subsequently divorced
one Maria Gonzales.

01:07:26.424 --> 01:07:27.789
That's not true.

01:07:27.959 --> 01:07:31.690
Reverend Frank has never been
married or divorced.

01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:34.725
That's what I thought too,
Grandma Jones.

01:07:34.899 --> 01:07:35.991
But...

01:07:36.167 --> 01:07:37.156
...Reverend Frank?

01:07:39.671 --> 01:07:41.002
It's true.

01:07:41.172 --> 01:07:42.161
What?

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.398
Oh, it's very true.

01:07:43.574 --> 01:07:46.509
How can we trust anything
he said to us now?

01:07:46.678 --> 01:07:49.875
We have put our relationship
in the hands of a total hypocrite.

01:07:51.849 --> 01:07:55.842
I didn't wanna have to talk about this
to protect certain parties...

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:58.989
...but enough time has passed
so the truth can finally be known.

01:07:59.157 --> 01:08:00.419
Yes. Please do.

01:08:00.591 --> 01:08:04.152
Several years ago, a young woman named
Maria Gonzales attended our church.

01:08:04.929 --> 01:08:08.194
She was a refugee who was
denied political asylum.

01:08:08.366 --> 01:08:12.962
If she was deported back to Guatemala,
she would have faced most certain death.

01:08:13.137 --> 01:08:16.072
So in order for her and her children
to stay in this country...

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.403
...I agreed to marry her
so she could get a green card.

01:08:19.743 --> 01:08:22.679
Once she was legal, we divorced.

01:08:22.846 --> 01:08:25.337
She moved to New Mexico with her kids.

01:08:25.515 --> 01:08:28.576
A couple of years ago I got a letter
from her, and she told me...

01:08:28.752 --> 01:08:32.211
...that her oldest
had been accepted to Harvard Law.

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:36.683
He was going to graduate
in the top of his class, and when he did...

01:08:36.861 --> 01:08:39.091
...he was going to go
into immigration reform.

01:08:39.263 --> 01:08:42.232
And that is the story of Maria Gonzales.

01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:45.532
I keep their pictures in my wallet...

01:08:48.573 --> 01:08:51.599
...to remind me that one person
can make a difference...

01:08:51.776 --> 01:08:53.573
...even against insurmountable odds.

01:08:55.212 --> 01:08:56.908
That's...
That's Pablo right there.

01:08:57.081 --> 01:08:58.139
Ben.

01:09:00.184 --> 01:09:05.121
If you had just spent half the amount
of time on your wedding vows...

01:09:05.288 --> 01:09:08.689
...as this stupid little investigation...

01:09:09.093 --> 01:09:12.028
...we would probably be walking
down the aisle tomorrow.

01:09:12.196 --> 01:09:13.959
And, no, no...

01:09:14.866 --> 01:09:16.731
I can't do it.

01:09:22.907 --> 01:09:26.240
- Unbelievable.
- You're such a jerk.

01:09:28.513 --> 01:09:29.639
Benjamin.

01:09:31.416 --> 01:09:33.077
Are you happy now?

01:09:34.018 --> 01:09:36.212
It's a painful process.

01:09:36.386 --> 01:09:37.684
That's why we do it.

01:09:37.854 --> 01:09:39.618
To find the truth, Benjamin.

01:09:40.358 --> 01:09:41.381
Sometim...

01:09:43.895 --> 01:09:47.261
Why did you punch the reverend?
What is wrong with you?

01:09:48.533 --> 01:09:51.502
Nice right hook, but you are going to hell.
Know that?

01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:53.694
I'm sorry. J.C., I'm sorry.

01:09:56.474 --> 01:09:59.602
Three weeks.
That's a new course record.

01:09:59.777 --> 01:10:03.440
Man, I haven't seen a right hook like that
since the Buffolini meltdown.

01:10:03.614 --> 01:10:05.912
I hate this part.

01:10:06.217 --> 01:10:08.481
I'll get the bag of frozen peas.
Come on.

01:10:08.886 --> 01:10:10.376
Here we go.

01:10:33.811 --> 01:10:35.210
Hi.

01:10:36.647 --> 01:10:39.343
I can't believe I was about to marry
someone I didn't know.

01:10:39.517 --> 01:10:41.644
That's why we have the course.

01:10:41.819 --> 01:10:44.481
It's good that I found out now
instead of down the road...

01:10:44.655 --> 01:10:47.055
...because that just
would have been awful.

01:10:47.792 --> 01:10:50.283
I'm sorry, he just, he makes me so mad.

01:10:50.928 --> 01:10:52.953
What am I supposed to do now?

01:10:53.898 --> 01:10:56.093
- You still have your honeymoon tickets?
- Yeah.

01:10:56.267 --> 01:10:57.359
Use them.

01:10:57.535 --> 01:11:01.096
Go away for a couple of days.
Take a friend, family, anybody.

01:11:02.039 --> 01:11:04.599
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, it'll be great for you.

01:11:05.243 --> 01:11:08.303
Get a tan, huh? Trust me.

01:11:11.816 --> 01:11:13.613
See you, kiddo.

01:11:14.986 --> 01:11:16.715
You know...

01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:19.985
...maybe Ben wasn't the only...

01:11:20.158 --> 01:11:21.182
No.

01:11:21.359 --> 01:11:24.556
- No, no. What? What?
- No, have a great trip.

01:11:31.536 --> 01:11:33.970
I mean, it wasn't supposed
to be like this.

01:11:34.138 --> 01:11:36.436
Yeah, I feel as bad as you do.

01:11:37.208 --> 01:11:40.405
Now she's using her honeymoon
ticket without me.

01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:42.906
I mean, how is that supposed
to make me feel?

01:11:43.814 --> 01:11:46.681
Bad. I think.

01:11:48.219 --> 01:11:53.350
Three weeks ago, I was the happiest guy
in the world, and now I just...

01:11:54.659 --> 01:11:56.286
Now I'm just sitting here with you.

01:11:57.495 --> 01:12:00.692
Thanks.
Thanks, Ben. Appreciate that.

01:12:00.865 --> 01:12:03.095
No, you know what I mean, I just...

01:12:03.267 --> 01:12:04.700
Hey, it's cool.

01:12:04.869 --> 01:12:09.897
Look, don't take this the wrong way,
because Sadie's cool, I like her a lot...

01:12:10.074 --> 01:12:12.235
...but there are plenty of fish in the sea.

01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:15.072
And now it's your time to be
the king barracuda...

01:12:15.246 --> 01:12:18.010
...and get out there
and swim with the sweet tuna.

01:12:18.182 --> 01:12:19.877
The ocean is yours, man.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.754
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:27.982
Okay.

01:12:28.926 --> 01:12:30.450
You're a bear.

01:12:30.628 --> 01:12:31.890
Now jump in that forest...

01:12:32.063 --> 01:12:35.226
...and you gotta tag as many
cute, furry, bear butts as you can.

01:12:35.399 --> 01:12:36.559
Joel...

01:12:36.734 --> 01:12:38.998
...you're my best friend, man.
You know that?

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:42.471
- And I love you. You know that?
- I love you too.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.804
But you have got to be
the worst advice-giver I know.

01:12:47.945 --> 01:12:50.971
I mean, not only is your
advice terrible, but...

01:12:51.148 --> 01:12:54.174
...it just backfires at every turn.

01:12:54.352 --> 01:12:57.879
And now you're talking to me
about fish and bears.

01:12:58.055 --> 01:13:01.752
She's a woman, Joel.
I mean, she's an amazing woman.

01:13:01.926 --> 01:13:04.224
And she's just so beautiful.

01:13:04.395 --> 01:13:08.126
And she's loving and...

01:13:08.366 --> 01:13:11.062
It was all right there...

01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:14.034
...and I lost it.

01:13:15.973 --> 01:13:20.171
And I don't need you telling me
that I should go out and find someone else.

01:13:20.344 --> 01:13:24.144
I mean, I don't need anybody
telling me how to go...

01:13:25.416 --> 01:13:27.680
I don't need anyone telling me.

01:13:28.819 --> 01:13:30.480
Wait. Where you...
Ben! Hey!

01:13:36.694 --> 01:13:38.855
No way.

01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:45.829
Whoa! Is that one strike
or two against Rodriguez?

01:13:46.003 --> 01:13:47.027
Two.

01:13:47.204 --> 01:13:49.502
Awesome job with the camouflage, guys.

01:13:49.674 --> 01:13:50.868
Seriously, you got me.

01:13:51.042 --> 01:13:54.205
Who'd have thought you'd be in a van
with "Saint Augustine's"?

01:13:54.445 --> 01:13:55.912
Just listening to the ball game!

01:13:57.014 --> 01:13:58.845
Cubs are off today.

01:14:14.932 --> 01:14:16.058
Hey, Gillie.

01:14:16.233 --> 01:14:19.134
This guy say he's in love.
He come to Jamaica to find his girl.

01:14:19.303 --> 01:14:22.761
Well, see, we were supposed to get married
and then she just called it off.

01:14:24.175 --> 01:14:26.643
Oh, no. It's a long story. Just...

01:14:26.811 --> 01:14:28.938
Man, you don't have to worry,
it's a long ride.

01:14:29.113 --> 01:14:32.241
It's really a long ride.
You can sit and tell us.

01:14:32.416 --> 01:14:33.906
Well, what happened was...

01:14:36.087 --> 01:14:39.716
It is absolutely beautiful here.

01:14:40.658 --> 01:14:43.354
Hey, Mom, you gonna get in your bikini?

01:14:43.527 --> 01:14:44.516
Like hell I will.

01:14:52.903 --> 01:14:55.667
Talk to her. This is for lovers, man!

01:14:56.006 --> 01:14:57.098
Thank you.

01:15:12.623 --> 01:15:13.988
It's Ben.

01:15:19.296 --> 01:15:20.786
- What?
- Sadie, it's me.

01:15:20.965 --> 01:15:23.763
- I know. What do you want?
- Look, I have to talk to you.

01:15:23.934 --> 01:15:25.458
Guess what, Ben?

01:15:25.636 --> 01:15:29.538
You had your chance. You had an empty
book and you didn't say anything.

01:15:29.707 --> 01:15:32.676
- And that's part of the thing. Listen...
- <i>No. Ben...</i>

01:15:32.843 --> 01:15:35.835
...I don't wanna talk to you.
- You don't understand. I'm in...

01:15:36.013 --> 01:15:37.605
Sadie?

01:15:38.082 --> 01:15:41.074
How come I could say so much
and he couldn't say anything to me?

01:15:41.252 --> 01:15:43.311
Can someone please explain that?

01:15:48.893 --> 01:15:50.258
Sorry.

01:15:50.428 --> 01:15:52.328
I was just clearing my throat.

01:15:52.496 --> 01:15:54.191
- John!
- What?

01:15:54.365 --> 01:15:56.629
A piece of coconut went down
the wrong way.

01:15:56.801 --> 01:15:58.428
Your daughter's in pain.

01:15:58.602 --> 01:16:01.400
- Yes, I'm in pain. And I'm all alone too.
- Not you.

01:16:01.572 --> 01:16:03.563
- I'm alone.
- Not you.

01:16:03.741 --> 01:16:07.108
Is anyone at all concerned
with the fact that my life is falling apart?

01:16:07.278 --> 01:16:09.906
Oh, of course we are, sweetie.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.742
But relationships are complicated.

01:16:12.917 --> 01:16:17.251
- We certainly don't have all the answers.
- You guys have been married for 30 years.

01:16:17.421 --> 01:16:21.551
- You must be doing something right.
- Not all those years were great.

01:16:21.725 --> 01:16:26.287
Years 16 through 18 in our marriage were
something straight out of <i>The Shining.</i>

01:16:27.231 --> 01:16:30.758
Okay, but Ben and I couldn't even decide on
what color napkins we wanted...

01:16:30.935 --> 01:16:32.664
...let alone how many kids.

01:16:32.837 --> 01:16:35.567
And he couldn't handle that
I have a good guy friend.

01:16:35.739 --> 01:16:39.004
I don't know if it's our friendship
he was insecure about.

01:16:39.176 --> 01:16:40.939
Really?

01:16:41.545 --> 01:16:43.445
Listen, I'm gonna support you here.

01:16:43.614 --> 01:16:46.777
But you gotta think about this
from Ben's perspective.

01:16:46.951 --> 01:16:49.749
How do you think he feels when you're
always coming to me?

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.718
- I don <i>'</i> t go to you all the time.
- When are you going to him?

01:16:53.858 --> 01:16:56.691
Just maybe...

01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:59.694
...Ben wants to be with somebody
who needs him for a change.

01:17:01.232 --> 01:17:02.790
That's really heartfelt.

01:17:21.185 --> 01:17:23.415
- Does this happen all the time?
- Sadie?

01:17:23.587 --> 01:17:26.385
To go from being so in love to this.

01:17:26.557 --> 01:17:29.082
You know, I'm all alone
on my honeymoon at Sandals...

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:33.128
<i>... couples in love all over the place.</i>
<i>This isn't what I pictured.</i>

01:17:33.297 --> 01:17:35.731
Well, is it ever what you picture?

01:17:36.534 --> 01:17:39.298
Were we the first ones to fail the course?

01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:43.099
Who said the course is over?
It's only over when you decide it's done.

01:17:43.307 --> 01:17:45.434
I don't know what to do.

01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:47.409
It'll come to you.

01:17:47.578 --> 01:17:49.102
Have faith.

01:17:50.748 --> 01:17:53.080
Thank you, Reverend Frank.

01:17:55.119 --> 01:17:56.279
Right on schedule.

01:17:56.453 --> 01:17:59.616
Hallelujah. Now do you mind?
I need my beauty sleep.

01:17:59.790 --> 01:18:04.420
No smoking on this flight, but you
can light up whatever once we land.

01:18:51.942 --> 01:18:53.773
- Ben?
- <i>Hey.</i>

01:18:53.944 --> 01:18:55.912
<i>You picked up.</i>

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.072
It's so weird.
I was just thinking about you.

01:18:59.249 --> 01:19:00.807
<i>You were?</i>

01:19:00.985 --> 01:19:02.612
Yeah.

01:19:03.354 --> 01:19:07.450
My family said some things
to me yesterday about...

01:19:07.625 --> 01:19:11.026
...me not relying on you and...

01:19:12.496 --> 01:19:14.964
...it got me thinking...

01:19:15.132 --> 01:19:17.225
...about that stupid truck...

01:19:17.401 --> 01:19:19.392
...you drew in your wedding
vow notebook.

01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:23.062
And I know this is gonna
sound so weird but...

01:19:26.877 --> 01:19:29.402
...it's why I love you.

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:34.212
You don't always say the right things
or do the right things but somehow...

01:19:35.185 --> 01:19:39.315
...I know you would jump through
a hoop of fire for me.

01:19:40.324 --> 01:19:42.690
<i>Hey, can you do me a favor?</i>

01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:47.925
<i>I think you should come to your window.</i>

01:20:07.918 --> 01:20:10.478
I left my vow book at home so...

01:20:10.654 --> 01:20:12.815
...I figured I should write
a few of them here.

01:20:15.392 --> 01:20:16.484
What do you think?

01:20:26.003 --> 01:20:28.062
- I am so sorry. I messed up.
- Me too.

01:20:28.238 --> 01:20:30.399
There's so much to say.
I just didn't know how.

01:20:30.574 --> 01:20:33.407
I need to stop doing everything myself
and share the reins.

01:20:33.577 --> 01:20:35.977
No matter what I do,
I know you're gonna support me.

01:20:36.146 --> 01:20:38.614
If I'm ever blindfolded,
you're the one to guide me.

01:20:38.782 --> 01:20:41.148
I want to have as many kids
as we possibly can.

01:20:41.318 --> 01:20:43.343
Really?
After Macy's, I definitely want two.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.044
I need to be more decisive.

01:20:45.222 --> 01:20:47.656
- About napkins, about...
- Napkins, cheese, anything...

01:20:47.825 --> 01:20:50.453
...at the end of the day,
I'm gonna rely on you.

01:20:50.627 --> 01:20:53.721
Because nothing means
more to me than you.

01:20:53.897 --> 01:20:56.798
Nothing. I love you.

01:20:56.967 --> 01:20:58.832
I love you.

01:21:06.543 --> 01:21:08.977
What's going on here?

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.714
Reverend Frank?
What are you doing here?

01:21:14.351 --> 01:21:16.819
Reverend Frank is
everywhere, remember?

01:21:16.987 --> 01:21:18.921
Thought you two broke up.

01:21:19.089 --> 01:21:22.490
We did. We just sort of talked it through.

01:21:22.659 --> 01:21:25.822
Seems like we have more faith
in each other than we thought.

01:21:26.296 --> 01:21:27.285
Congratulations.

01:21:27.464 --> 01:21:29.557
You just passed the course
with flying colors.

01:21:30.868 --> 01:21:32.335
So how about it?

01:21:32.503 --> 01:21:34.698
Do you think we should
get this wedding started?

01:21:36.406 --> 01:21:37.532
I do.

01:21:38.475 --> 01:21:41.137
And do you,
Benjamin Fitzpatrick Murphy...

01:21:41.311 --> 01:21:46.408
...take Sadie Wilhelmina Jones
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:21:46.583 --> 01:21:49.780
- I do.
- The rings.

01:21:53.657 --> 01:21:55.716
"Never to fart"?

01:21:55.893 --> 01:21:57.019
Oh, my God.

01:21:57.194 --> 01:21:59.754
I didn't change it.
I'm gonna change it when I get back.

01:21:59.930 --> 01:22:00.988
- I promise I will.
- No.

01:22:01.165 --> 01:22:05.226
Bite your tongue, because I wouldn't want
it changed for anything in the whole world.

01:22:05.402 --> 01:22:06.994
No.

01:22:14.578 --> 01:22:16.102
Ready?

01:22:18.081 --> 01:22:21.016
By the power vested in me by God...

01:22:21.185 --> 01:22:26.213
...and the Minister of National Security
and Justice of Ocho Rios, Jamaica...

01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:30.383
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:23:10.567 --> 01:23:13.092
You gotta turn. There it is!

01:23:26.850 --> 01:23:29.546
Frank, we just wanted to come
and thank you for everything.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:32.245
- I'm just fulfilling my life's calling.
- You know what?

01:23:32.422 --> 01:23:35.619
- We wouldn't have gotten here without you.
- Thanks.

01:23:35.792 --> 01:23:38.317
You're gonna have a wonderful life.
I have no doubts.

01:23:38.495 --> 01:23:42.261
Excuse me, may I borrow my daughter...
Your wife, for a dance?

01:23:42.432 --> 01:23:44.127
- Yes, please.
- Thank you.

01:23:44.301 --> 01:23:46.701
- Bye.
- You look beautiful.

01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:48.394
Hey, can I ask you a question?

01:23:48.572 --> 01:23:49.630
Sure.

01:23:49.806 --> 01:23:52.331
When did you know that we were
ready to get married?

01:23:52.509 --> 01:23:57.105
The moment you told Joel that Sadie wasn't
a fish, I knew it was meant to be.

01:23:57.281 --> 01:24:00.444
Besides, anybody who kicks
a reverend's ass for his woman...

01:24:00.617 --> 01:24:02.016
...you're A-okay in my book.

01:24:02.185 --> 01:24:03.243
Well...

01:24:04.021 --> 01:24:06.990
You're starting an incredible journey
with a wonderful partner.

01:24:07.157 --> 01:24:08.317
Thank you.

01:24:08.492 --> 01:24:11.984
And on the honeymoon, act surprised.

01:24:12.162 --> 01:24:13.493
I will.

01:24:13.664 --> 01:24:16.531
- Take care of yourself, B.
- You too, Frank.

01:24:26.343 --> 01:24:28.334
Oh, my God.

01:24:33.216 --> 01:24:35.912
- Wait.
- No, that's what they're supposed to do.

01:24:36.086 --> 01:24:39.852
I know. I lost... We broke...

01:24:40.023 --> 01:24:41.820
But it's okay if we laugh, right?

01:24:41.992 --> 01:24:43.550
It's not okay if we laugh, is it?

01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:49.023
- You broke!
- I did not.

01:24:49.633 --> 01:24:51.726
We still got a siren. My ride's here.

01:24:51.902 --> 01:24:55.201
I like shooting downtown L.A.,
because pretty much you got 911 all day.

01:24:55.372 --> 01:24:56.361
I'll be over here.

01:25:00.344 --> 01:25:04.337
Whoa!
"Be chill, don't kill."

01:25:04.514 --> 01:25:07.483
That goes for you too, Mr. Simpson.
Okay.

01:25:10.754 --> 01:25:12.346
I thought you'd work so hard!

01:25:13.657 --> 01:25:16.922
Just get me a bottle of water
and a rubber mallet.

01:25:22.699 --> 01:25:26.601
Come on.
Thrust it, thrust it, thrust it!

01:25:28.472 --> 01:25:31.908
People, we can do this.
They're not that...

01:25:32.075 --> 01:25:33.804
Ben?

01:25:37.581 --> 01:25:42.018
Help out, everybody.
Motherf* * * er.

01:25:42.519 --> 01:25:44.783
You play cutch?

01:25:44.955 --> 01:25:45.944
"Cutch."

01:25:46.123 --> 01:25:49.581
Let me walk back and cutch,
which is a old game.

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.921
That's scary that I could
say it like that...

01:25:52.429 --> 01:25:54.124
Oh, my God.

01:25:55.132 --> 01:25:56.997
No. Stop.

01:26:00.237 --> 01:26:03.138
I'm gonna look like such a rookie,
because every time...

01:26:03.974 --> 01:26:05.635
Cut.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.445
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
