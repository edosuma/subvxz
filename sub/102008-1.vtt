00:23.145 --> 00:24.682
<i>Your name
is Ana Walker.</i>

00:26.249 --> 00:29.257
<i>Your father died
when you were ten.</i>

00:29.289 --> 00:32.266
<i>And you've missed him
every day since then.</i>

00:34.090 --> 00:37.290
<i>When you were 12,
you went to sleep one night,</i>

00:37.322 --> 00:40.906
<i>and as you were lying there
in the darkness,</i>

00:40.938 --> 00:44.361
<i>you felt this sudden wave
of dread.</i>

00:45.770 --> 00:48.714
<i>You couldn't breathe,
couldn't move.</i>

00:48.746 --> 00:51.530
<i>It was at that moment you
understood what it means to die.</i>

00:52.522 --> 00:55.785
<i>This fear of non-existence.</i>

00:56.841 --> 00:58.728
<i>That was a long time ago,</i>

00:58.761 --> 01:01.034
<i>but sometimes the fear returns.</i>

01:02.665 --> 01:04.393
<i>You have a boyfriend.</i>

01:07.786 --> 01:10.570
<i>And he loves you more than
anything in the world.</i>

01:12.458 --> 01:14.025
<i>Problem is...</i>

01:28.842 --> 01:30.057
<i>Hello.</i>

01:30.090 --> 01:31.658
It's so beautiful, Mom.

01:31.690 --> 01:33.674
<i>Are you coming
to see me tomorrow?</i>

01:33.706 --> 01:36.361
No. I can't visit you tomorrow,
or the day after.

01:36.393 --> 01:38.217
I just told you,
we're in France.

01:38.249 --> 01:40.298
<i>Do you hear me?
It's very important</i>

01:40.330 --> 01:42.378
<i>you remember
what I tell you now.</i>

01:42.410 --> 01:45.065
<i>Your desires
are like guiding lights</i>

01:45.098 --> 01:47.146
<i>shining through
from the future.</i>

01:47.178 --> 01:49.034
<i>You have to know
who you are.</i>

01:49.066 --> 01:50.186
<i>Understood?</i>

01:51.721 --> 01:53.930
Mom, I have to go now.

01:53.961 --> 01:55.625
It's expensive
to call from here.

01:56.297 --> 01:57.610
I love you.

02:06.153 --> 02:08.009
I don't think she knew
who I was.

02:08.041 --> 02:10.825
I don't know why
you keep calling her.

02:10.857 --> 02:12.745
It only ever
brings you down.

02:15.242 --> 02:16.425
Come on.

02:17.162 --> 02:19.401
Stop it!

02:29.097 --> 02:30.474
Oh, my God,
is he insane?

02:31.338 --> 02:33.001
He's going too fast.

02:33.768 --> 02:34.857
It's fine.

02:36.042 --> 02:37.066
Guy's probably
driven this way

02:37.098 --> 02:38.441
a thousand times before.

02:40.649 --> 02:42.954
God, he's texting.

02:50.697 --> 02:53.514
Close your eyes. Okay?

02:53.546 --> 02:56.426
- Just count your breaths.
- One.

02:56.457 --> 02:59.561
- Relax.
- Two.

03:00.297 --> 03:01.962
Three.

03:01.994 --> 03:03.497
Four.

03:08.425 --> 03:09.674
Shit.

03:11.530 --> 03:12.586
You okay?

03:14.153 --> 03:17.194
It... it hurts.

03:18.345 --> 03:20.170
You hit something?

03:22.410 --> 03:25.290
I just want to get out.

03:25.322 --> 03:27.689
- What do you mean, you wanna...
- Now.

03:41.290 --> 03:43.370
What are we
supposed to do now?

03:43.401 --> 03:45.098
Can you just
check Google?

03:48.266 --> 03:50.090
We're out of range.

04:00.362 --> 04:01.385
What's this?

04:03.626 --> 04:05.385
Police,
medical assistance.

04:05.418 --> 04:07.530
I... I feel
safer that way.

04:07.562 --> 04:10.954
Well, whoever wants to
save his life will lose it.

04:13.834 --> 04:14.954
Where did you hear that?

04:17.609 --> 04:18.794
I can't remember.

04:20.554 --> 04:21.578
All right.

04:23.402 --> 04:24.522
Come on.

04:28.330 --> 04:29.546
Let's just go back.

04:29.577 --> 04:32.330
Catch a bus to Dijon
and get on the train there.

04:33.737 --> 04:34.985
What about money?

04:35.018 --> 04:36.266
Well, we have enough
to get there.

04:36.297 --> 04:38.762
We'll just get
a different job.

04:38.794 --> 04:41.066
We have a plan,
let's just stick to it.

04:41.097 --> 04:43.272
Okay, then where's
the damn house?

04:48.714 --> 04:50.474
I don't think
this is the right place.

04:53.577 --> 04:55.274
It's not supposed
to have a fence.

05:05.417 --> 05:08.778
Look.
Isn't the same house.

05:31.689 --> 05:32.810
<i>Bonjour.</i>

05:33.514 --> 05:35.145
<i>Bonjour.</i>

05:35.177 --> 05:36.746
- Hello?
- Hi.

05:36.777 --> 05:38.570
We're the, uh,
the guys from the ad.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.378
Yes, of course.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.074
So it's...
it's here?

05:45.162 --> 05:47.786
Just, the place
looks different.

05:47.818 --> 05:48.938
It does?

05:50.633 --> 05:52.392
My name is Richard Rolle.

05:52.425 --> 05:53.609
Ana.

05:54.409 --> 05:55.625
Has, uh...

05:55.658 --> 05:57.897
Has France lived up
to your expectations?

05:57.930 --> 06:00.458
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Yeah, we're loving it.

06:02.218 --> 06:05.098
Wow. We have to go there.

06:05.993 --> 06:07.305
It's, uh...

06:08.330 --> 06:10.089
It's quite a walk,

06:10.122 --> 06:11.978
all the way around the
other side of the village.

06:14.698 --> 06:15.945
Are you hungry?

06:16.618 --> 06:17.865
Come on.

06:27.146 --> 06:28.617
Please, come in.

06:29.641 --> 06:31.082
Make yourselves at home.

06:42.377 --> 06:43.722
Wow.

06:43.754 --> 06:45.353
It's like a museum.

06:46.249 --> 06:48.137
Yes. And, uh...

06:48.169 --> 06:49.449
I am the curator.

07:05.417 --> 07:06.762
So many
beautiful things.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.153
Must have cost a bit.

07:18.185 --> 07:22.314
Well, it's amazing what one
can achieve by thinking.

07:22.345 --> 07:24.809
When you're ready,
the kitchen is downstairs.

07:28.137 --> 07:29.321
Want some?

07:34.729 --> 07:35.721
How is the food?

07:37.322 --> 07:38.345
Very good.

07:40.298 --> 07:41.418
Yummy.

07:41.449 --> 07:42.826
Exquisite.

07:44.042 --> 07:46.377
You know, it's not often
we get Americans

07:46.410 --> 07:49.098
looking for work in
this part of France.

07:49.129 --> 07:50.506
Yeah, well,

07:50.537 --> 07:53.865
we're not all fat
bankers smoking cigars.

07:53.898 --> 07:55.689
Maybe we're not
thinking enough.

08:00.298 --> 08:02.569
Anyway, Dick,

08:02.601 --> 08:05.033
what is it you want us
to do here?

08:05.066 --> 08:06.122
Well, uh...

08:08.842 --> 08:10.058
There is a lot to be done.

08:11.370 --> 08:13.642
I have a...

08:13.673 --> 08:15.978
an area which needs
to be cleared of rocks.

08:16.009 --> 08:20.297
I have some trees
which need to be cut down.

08:20.329 --> 08:23.594
There is a wall at the end of the
garden which is in need of repair.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.449
I thought guys like you
had gardeners.

08:28.202 --> 08:30.986
If I had, I wouldn't meet
interesting people like you, would I?

08:34.218 --> 08:35.626
What about the locals?

08:37.194 --> 08:38.793
What about them?

08:38.825 --> 08:41.034
Well, I'm just saying,
can't you hire any locals to do it?

08:43.625 --> 08:46.761
They are just old
and decrepit.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.289
What are you paying?

08:49.322 --> 08:51.113
Tom. Do you
have to be so...

08:51.146 --> 08:52.617
Two hundred euros a day.

08:54.537 --> 08:57.033
Plus a very nice room
for you both upstairs.

09:00.586 --> 09:02.602
Full board.

09:02.633 --> 09:04.170
We accept.

09:04.201 --> 09:06.602
Well...

09:10.538 --> 09:11.625
You live here alone?

09:13.289 --> 09:14.378
Not anymore.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.769
We are set.

09:27.081 --> 09:29.802
Ah, can you believe
this house?

09:29.833 --> 09:31.529
And the wages?

09:31.562 --> 09:34.377
We will be filthy rich.

09:35.881 --> 09:37.993
Just... don't ruin it.

09:38.697 --> 09:41.322
Please, Tom,
don't ruin it.

09:41.353 --> 09:42.537
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

09:42.570 --> 09:44.969
this big macho idiot
that lives inside you

09:45.002 --> 09:46.729
and will get you
killed one day.

09:46.761 --> 09:48.842
Come on, "Dick"?

09:48.873 --> 09:51.145
What? I was just
being friendly.

09:51.177 --> 09:52.426
What an asshole.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.329
I didn't like his food.

09:59.146 --> 10:00.137
You didn't?

10:01.482 --> 10:03.146
It wasn't a burger
and fries, was it?

10:07.049 --> 10:08.425
Behave yourself,
or I'll kill you.

10:20.585 --> 10:22.217
"Your"?

10:22.249 --> 10:24.458
When will you learn
how to spell, dummy?

10:24.489 --> 10:25.737
Called me dumb?

10:25.769 --> 10:27.209
Yeah. You're a dummy.

10:27.242 --> 10:28.393
Oh, I love it when you
call me dumb.

10:28.425 --> 10:29.481
Yeah, you're a dummy.

10:29.514 --> 10:31.017
Yeah, you're a dummy.

10:31.049 --> 10:33.385
Big, dumb body slam.

10:35.849 --> 10:37.802
Oh, no.

12:19.561 --> 12:20.617
Tom?

12:49.321 --> 12:50.377
Hey.

12:51.594 --> 12:52.873
What's wrong, babe?

12:54.602 --> 12:55.785
Bad dream?

12:58.826 --> 13:00.042
I was in a hospital.

13:00.777 --> 13:03.561
I couldn't move.
I couldn't speak.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.705
I could just watch.

13:07.593 --> 13:08.713
There was this man...

13:11.241 --> 13:12.649
with a needle.

13:12.681 --> 13:14.249
It was just a dream, baby.

13:15.690 --> 13:17.353
I didn't feel
like a dream.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.354
It felt like when I dreamt
about my father.

13:21.386 --> 13:24.746
I know. He was already on
his deathbed at that point.

13:29.098 --> 13:31.401
I feel strange here.
And I think we should leave.

13:31.433 --> 13:32.777
You gotta be
kidding me.

13:34.890 --> 13:36.169
We need this money.

13:38.505 --> 13:40.425
Something bad will happen.

13:40.457 --> 13:42.313
What do you mean,
something bad's gonna happen?

13:43.369 --> 13:44.490
The worst thing
that can happen

13:44.522 --> 13:46.378
is if the fucking freak
goes insane on us.

13:47.817 --> 13:49.097
You don't think
I can handle it?

13:50.922 --> 13:51.882
There you go.

13:52.970 --> 13:55.785
Look, you're safe with me.

13:55.817 --> 13:57.321
Okay?

14:33.258 --> 14:34.601
What's wrong?

14:34.985 --> 14:36.073
Ah.

14:44.906 --> 14:46.153
Be more careful.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.161
Come help me.

14:51.145 --> 14:52.841
I can get tetanus.

14:55.434 --> 14:56.809
It's just a scratch.

15:33.770 --> 15:36.169
Hello?

15:36.201 --> 15:38.121
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

15:38.153 --> 15:39.466
No way.

15:39.498 --> 15:41.065
- Just...
- Please.

15:42.057 --> 15:43.338
Don't ever go
into the barn.

15:45.769 --> 15:46.921
Of course.

15:46.953 --> 15:48.841
I just thought
someone was crying.

15:50.154 --> 15:53.385
No. Just must be
the wind or something.

15:59.145 --> 16:00.489
What happened to your hand?

16:00.522 --> 16:04.169
Yeah, I was just digging
up some stones and...

16:04.201 --> 16:06.153
I'm sorry. I Should have
given you gloves.

16:06.921 --> 16:09.033
But I forgot.

16:09.065 --> 16:11.210
You know,
it's nothing serious.

16:13.608 --> 16:15.946
Yes, well...

16:15.978 --> 16:18.665
We should disinfect it.
Come with me.

16:36.873 --> 16:39.401
So, you're a doctor?

16:41.162 --> 16:44.328
No, I'm a serial killer.

16:49.737 --> 16:51.048
Does it hurt?

16:51.081 --> 16:52.362
No.

16:59.688 --> 17:02.090
We're a very long way from
the nearest hospital. So...

17:03.753 --> 17:05.448
one has to be, uh...

17:06.441 --> 17:07.529
self-sufficient.

17:09.225 --> 17:11.241
I hope you know
what you're doing.

17:12.297 --> 17:14.634
I often have to help out
the locals.

17:16.008 --> 17:18.025
The petit doctor
they call me.

17:21.064 --> 17:23.561
I used to be sick a lot
when I was a child.

17:24.713 --> 17:26.090
Do you have any, uh...

17:27.050 --> 17:28.778
health issues?

17:28.810 --> 17:32.553
I'm allergic to the pollen
of, like, every plant.

17:33.578 --> 17:35.626
Asthma symptoms.

17:35.658 --> 17:38.442
But the allergy's gotten
better since we got to France.

17:39.273 --> 17:40.458
Let me look.

17:43.785 --> 17:45.001
Your eyes look normal.

17:46.025 --> 17:47.849
I think everything
should be fine.

17:57.866 --> 17:59.721
You should go and
meet your boyfriend.

18:29.225 --> 18:30.410
What the fuck?

18:35.337 --> 18:36.970
Tom!

18:38.121 --> 18:39.114
Yeah.

18:47.241 --> 18:48.329
What are you doing?

18:48.842 --> 18:51.048
Nothing. Let's go.

18:55.048 --> 18:57.002
American cuisine night

18:57.034 --> 18:58.888
at Dick's bed
and breakfast.

18:58.922 --> 19:00.874
Aww. Thanks.

19:02.505 --> 19:04.170
Took a lot less time
than <i>boeuf bourguignon,</i>

19:04.202 --> 19:05.481
I can assure you.

19:11.882 --> 19:13.674
Excuse me?

19:13.706 --> 19:15.305
<i>Eternity,</i> you have, uh...

19:15.338 --> 19:17.033
- Oh.
- ...Rimbaud on your T shirt?

19:17.065 --> 19:19.721
Yeah, I like
his poetry a lot.

19:22.090 --> 19:23.978
Well, we were
thinking after dinner...

19:27.818 --> 19:29.097
It is found again.

19:41.033 --> 19:43.945
Is Rimbaud popular
in the U.S.?

19:47.050 --> 19:48.617
I don't think so.

19:49.705 --> 19:50.985
My father was a teacher

19:51.018 --> 19:53.513
and he was
his favorite poet.

19:53.545 --> 19:54.794
He used to talk about...

19:54.825 --> 19:56.874
Well, this was... Yeah.

19:56.906 --> 19:59.112
This is...
this is lovely.

19:59.145 --> 20:02.025
Yeah. I think Ana and I
will go and take a walk

20:02.057 --> 20:03.434
before it gets dark.

20:03.465 --> 20:06.218
Ana wants to go and see the
lavender fields, don't you?

20:06.250 --> 20:09.354
So, yeah. Do you have
the remote for us?

20:10.728 --> 20:12.010
I have only one.

20:13.065 --> 20:14.154
Right.

20:15.465 --> 20:19.433
So, uh, are we your
prisoners now?

20:24.168 --> 20:25.322
And what was that
all about?

20:25.354 --> 20:26.378
What?

20:26.410 --> 20:29.577
Your homeboy routine.
What else?

20:29.610 --> 20:31.530
Can't you see how
embarrassing it is for me?

20:31.561 --> 20:32.872
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:32.906 --> 20:34.346
I just didn't realize
you were gonna talk

20:34.377 --> 20:36.521
about your father with the
first fucking person you met.

20:37.257 --> 20:38.666
Are you jealous?

20:38.698 --> 20:39.722
Am I jealous?

20:39.754 --> 20:40.778
Fuck, no, I'm fine.

20:40.810 --> 20:41.994
Just sitting there
listening to you

20:42.026 --> 20:44.297
and some French faggot
recite poetry.

20:44.328 --> 20:48.105
Look, I'm not gonna have this
conversation with you right now.

20:48.777 --> 20:50.025
You're delusional.

20:50.057 --> 20:51.178
Oh, you started it.

21:02.858 --> 21:03.914
What's he waiting for?

23:26.090 --> 23:27.114
Oh.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.353
It's you.

23:30.057 --> 23:31.722
Welcome to France.

23:31.754 --> 23:32.874
Jeez.

23:34.665 --> 23:36.298
No TV.

23:36.329 --> 23:37.545
No WiFi.

23:39.561 --> 23:41.033
It's like the Middle Ages.

23:42.441 --> 23:45.321
If he's got any <i>Rambo</i>
in English, let me know.

23:45.354 --> 23:47.241
We'll see what the fuss
is all about.

23:48.330 --> 23:49.577
Check this out.

23:58.921 --> 24:00.137
Faulty copies.

24:01.162 --> 24:02.409
Maybe he bought
them wholesale

24:02.442 --> 24:04.137
to appear well read.

24:06.409 --> 24:07.753
These are like new.

24:07.786 --> 24:08.777
This one's old.

24:10.218 --> 24:11.978
Do you think...
he collects

24:12.009 --> 24:14.602
defective books
as a hobby?

24:14.633 --> 24:16.393
Won't be the
weirdest thing about him.

24:44.522 --> 24:45.545
Check...

24:46.186 --> 24:47.242
this out.

24:51.721 --> 24:52.906
Mm.

24:54.122 --> 24:55.178
This song.

25:04.938 --> 25:05.929
Oh.

25:06.537 --> 25:07.689
Hmm.

25:08.522 --> 25:09.705
That's weird.

25:33.545 --> 25:35.177
This is fucking freaky.

25:36.489 --> 25:37.641
You know what?

25:37.674 --> 25:39.081
Let's go to the city.

25:50.985 --> 25:52.137
We've been
trying to call a cab

25:52.170 --> 25:54.506
for the last, like,
30 minutes.

25:54.537 --> 25:57.289
You're telling me nobody
answers their phone around here?

25:57.321 --> 25:58.761
No. Why don't you
try again?

26:00.393 --> 26:01.641
Let me try again.

26:03.177 --> 26:04.298
Wow, that's funny,
isn't it?

26:05.066 --> 26:06.218
Why?

26:09.897 --> 26:12.297
Why are there graves
in your garden?

26:13.321 --> 26:14.889
What?

26:14.922 --> 26:17.386
I didn't want to scare you
after the dream and all.

26:18.825 --> 26:20.649
Four graves
down by the pond.

26:21.545 --> 26:22.505
Yes.

26:23.369 --> 26:24.458
So what's in them?

26:28.617 --> 26:29.833
Dead bodies...

26:35.721 --> 26:36.842
of my dogs.

26:40.169 --> 26:41.546
I can give you a shovel.

26:41.577 --> 26:43.369
You could dig them up
and check for yourself.

26:47.754 --> 26:49.545
What about the strange books
and vinyls?

26:50.186 --> 26:51.465
Tom.

26:51.498 --> 26:54.026
- Strange?
- Well. they're incomplete, aren't they?

26:55.305 --> 26:57.449
Which is my memory
of them all.

26:57.482 --> 26:58.857
What the fuck
does that mean?

27:00.009 --> 27:01.098
It's what I remember.

27:04.809 --> 27:06.762
All right, you know what?

27:06.793 --> 27:08.617
We don't like
what's going on here.

27:10.281 --> 27:11.273
Why?

27:12.393 --> 27:13.641
Have I harmed you?

27:14.089 --> 27:15.369
Harmed us?

27:17.353 --> 27:18.441
No.

27:18.474 --> 27:20.233
No, you see,

27:20.265 --> 27:23.049
I wouldn't allow you...
to harm us.

27:24.746 --> 27:25.769
So why don't you
just tell me

27:25.802 --> 27:27.529
what the fuck
is going on here?

27:32.457 --> 27:34.313
If you don't want
to do this job,

27:34.346 --> 27:36.618
I'm sure I can find
someone else to do it.

27:36.649 --> 27:38.345
I can pay you
for what you've done,

27:39.402 --> 27:40.521
and then you can go.

27:45.385 --> 27:46.601
It's raining.

27:49.193 --> 27:51.465
Well, I can't account for
the weather now, can I?

27:51.497 --> 27:52.553
Fuck you.

27:56.649 --> 27:57.705
Sorry.

28:36.617 --> 28:37.673
Tom.

29:34.762 --> 29:36.073
I need help!

29:36.105 --> 29:37.193
Help me!

29:38.762 --> 29:40.201
I don't know...

30:01.065 --> 30:02.153
I'm really...

30:03.945 --> 30:05.161
I'm really afraid of dogs.

30:06.377 --> 30:08.105
Please!
I need help.

30:30.410 --> 30:31.977
Get the syringe
from the chair.

30:35.017 --> 30:36.009
Now stick it in.

30:37.290 --> 30:39.721
- Where?
- Right through his rectum, dammit.

30:41.449 --> 30:42.633
Oh, please.

30:47.305 --> 30:48.457
Not too fast.

30:48.489 --> 30:49.610
Count to three.

30:50.634 --> 30:52.969
One, two.

30:54.025 --> 30:55.017
Three.

30:55.049 --> 30:58.025
Keep it down.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.721
Count to three
one more time.

31:00.362 --> 31:01.769
One.

31:02.154 --> 31:04.138
Two. Three.

31:24.681 --> 31:25.929
A major
cluster seizure.

31:28.106 --> 31:29.417
Diazepam...

31:30.537 --> 31:32.265
is the most
efficient way

31:33.321 --> 31:35.145
to administer
if you can't find a vein.

31:38.089 --> 31:39.498
I couldn't have
done it without you.

31:41.546 --> 31:42.793
Thank you.

31:50.986 --> 31:52.138
Are they all sick?

31:54.922 --> 31:56.329
Their genes are sick.

31:58.185 --> 31:59.337
The whole breed.

32:01.161 --> 32:03.498
When they're born as little
puppies, they have, um,

32:04.650 --> 32:07.081
their deaths
buried deep inside them.

32:08.362 --> 32:10.186
And as they grow,
so does it.

32:12.170 --> 32:13.577
And then one day, yeah.

32:19.722 --> 32:20.874
But they're all different.

32:22.857 --> 32:26.025
Freddie, he's so obedient

32:26.057 --> 32:29.033
that I sometimes think
he has no will of his own.

32:29.065 --> 32:31.497
But this other one,
this other male...

32:31.530 --> 32:33.929
He's completely useless.

32:35.337 --> 32:36.713
Afraid of everything.

32:38.825 --> 32:39.946
What's his name?

32:41.481 --> 32:42.762
Only Freddie has a name.

32:44.617 --> 32:45.610
Why?

32:48.490 --> 32:49.961
Names create bonds.

32:53.577 --> 32:55.049
You gave Freddie a name.

32:57.097 --> 32:58.090
Yes.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.473
And that was a mistake.

34:07.049 --> 34:08.202
You're awake.

34:11.881 --> 34:13.034
Where have you been?

34:16.425 --> 34:17.961
I just went
to get some water.

34:21.578 --> 34:22.634
What's wrong?

34:27.274 --> 34:28.362
Nothing.

34:49.128 --> 34:52.073
- What are you doing?
- We're going south.

34:52.105 --> 34:53.928
Sorry for not listening
to you before.

34:55.306 --> 34:57.258
What...
What are you afraid of?

34:57.994 --> 35:00.106
What do you mean?

35:00.138 --> 35:02.954
I thought you were the one
that was afraid to stay here.

35:02.986 --> 35:06.858
I just overreacted.
I had a terrible dream.

35:06.890 --> 35:08.554
I... I like it here.

35:09.706 --> 35:11.208
Oh, you like it here now?

35:12.554 --> 35:13.674
Yeah.

35:15.402 --> 35:16.394
Okay.

35:17.450 --> 35:18.537
Yeah. No, we can stay.

35:22.058 --> 35:23.882
What is it that made you
change your mind?

35:26.568 --> 35:27.593
You don't know?

35:30.954 --> 35:33.578
You're fucking crazy
sometimes, you know that?

35:33.610 --> 35:35.402
You're fucking crazy,
like your mother.

36:14.537 --> 36:15.689
I have to take a leak.

36:16.521 --> 36:19.529
Of course. Be my guest.

37:13.737 --> 37:14.952
Ana.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.512
I'm feeling dizzy.

37:26.058 --> 37:27.658
I think I may fall.

37:29.001 --> 37:31.241
Please get me some water
from the kitchen.

38:04.042 --> 38:05.194
What are you doing here?

38:07.049 --> 38:08.265
You know those graves?

38:11.849 --> 38:14.090
Were you going through
his private things?

38:14.121 --> 38:16.489
I saw him hiding something
in here, okay?

38:18.858 --> 38:20.649
Show me what's
in your pockets.

38:20.682 --> 38:22.346
What?

38:22.378 --> 38:24.394
Show me what's
in your pockets, Tom.

38:24.425 --> 38:26.505
What do you mean?
There's nothing in my pockets.

38:31.018 --> 38:33.098
I swear to God,
I've never even seen those before.

38:33.129 --> 38:34.985
You promised you'd
never do it again.

38:35.018 --> 38:36.009
And I didn't.

38:36.969 --> 38:38.472
What have you done, Tom?

38:38.505 --> 38:40.682
Do I really
pay you too little?

38:40.713 --> 38:43.593
This is like the most
primitive set up in history.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.386
No, go on, then. How did you
get them in my pocket?

38:45.418 --> 38:47.273
- Tom!
- No. Shut the fuck up!

38:47.306 --> 38:48.522
I know where you went
last night.

38:48.554 --> 38:50.474
- Don't you fucking lie to me.
- How dare you!

38:50.505 --> 38:51.977
- Dare...
- Enough!

38:52.009 --> 38:54.314
There'll be no more shouting
in my house.

38:54.345 --> 38:55.752
You're nothing
but a thief.

38:55.786 --> 38:57.065
I'm calling the police.

39:00.042 --> 39:01.833
Stop it! He's sick!

39:05.738 --> 39:06.985
Oh, fuck.

39:07.017 --> 39:08.714
Ana, I'm sorry, I...

39:08.745 --> 39:10.217
I'm so fucking sorry.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.249
Leave her alone.

39:14.282 --> 39:15.594
Get out of my house.

39:15.625 --> 39:17.897
This is fucking crazy.
I'm calling the cops.

39:19.049 --> 39:20.265
Go ahead.

39:20.298 --> 39:22.601
Yeah, let them fucking see
what's going on here.

39:24.297 --> 39:25.481
Hello.

39:26.090 --> 39:27.626
<i>Hello.</i>

39:27.658 --> 39:29.417
Yeah. Police?

39:29.449 --> 39:30.729
<i>Yes, police.</i>

39:32.618 --> 39:35.242
<i>You're inside of me.
Understand?</i>

39:39.338 --> 39:41.449
<i>There can only be
one alpha male in the pack.</i>

39:42.441 --> 39:44.938
<i>You either accept the rules,
or you die.</i>

40:32.265 --> 40:33.354
Mr. Dawkins?

40:35.722 --> 40:37.737
Your name is Tom Dawkins.

40:38.537 --> 40:39.626
You had an accident,

40:39.657 --> 40:41.386
and we made you
sleep for 12 days

40:41.417 --> 40:42.602
to protect your brain.

40:47.562 --> 40:49.993
- Where's Ana?
- Miss Walker is with us.

40:53.289 --> 40:55.113
- Did you get him?
- Who?

40:55.145 --> 40:57.866
The fucking psychopath
from the house where...

40:59.049 --> 41:00.649
where we had the accident.

41:00.682 --> 41:04.457
Your accident didn't happen
in any house, Mr. Dawkins.

41:04.489 --> 41:07.497
You were traveling on a bus
and it rolled over.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.721
You were lucky, too.

41:11.754 --> 41:14.122
A whole family died
in that mess.

41:17.225 --> 41:18.953
No. No, no, we were...

41:21.193 --> 41:24.938
No, we were on the bus,
and then we went to the house.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.745
It's the man with the dogs.

41:28.778 --> 41:31.753
That is what propofol does,
Mr. Dawkins.

41:31.785 --> 41:32.841
Vivid dreams.

41:35.625 --> 41:37.609
- It was a dream?
- A dream.

41:40.425 --> 41:41.481
Sylvia...

41:47.626 --> 41:49.194
I want to see her.

41:49.225 --> 41:51.593
You've been lying next to her
for two weeks.

41:52.426 --> 41:53.802
Today, you have to rest.

41:53.833 --> 41:56.201
I want to see her.
Please.

42:07.242 --> 42:09.321
When will she wake up?

42:09.354 --> 42:11.753
Maybe tomorrow,
maybe years from now.

42:12.649 --> 42:14.154
Years?

42:14.185 --> 42:17.546
We have a patient here who has
been in a coma for four years.

42:20.393 --> 42:22.729
We were unable to contact
Miss Walker's mother.

42:23.369 --> 42:24.489
She's, um...

42:27.529 --> 42:28.906
She's in a mental hospital.

42:30.409 --> 42:32.169
No other relatives?

42:33.481 --> 42:35.241
I don't understand why...

42:38.697 --> 42:39.882
Why aren't you helping her?

42:41.001 --> 42:44.266
Of course.
There's verticalization,

42:44.297 --> 42:46.473
massage, hydrotherapy,

42:46.505 --> 42:48.618
music therapy,
even dog therapy.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.345
You're not doing anything.

42:50.377 --> 42:54.537
After a severe trauma
bodies switch off the brain,

42:54.569 --> 42:56.777
so to say, to save energy.

42:56.809 --> 42:59.817
Keep it from damage
and facilitate healing.

42:59.849 --> 43:01.546
It will turn on by itself.

43:02.058 --> 43:04.041
When? If it's ready.

43:08.297 --> 43:09.386
I want to see her.

43:31.401 --> 43:35.081
Today, my job is to prevent
infections and bed sores.

43:42.282 --> 43:45.002
This is the real
field of medicine.

43:48.937 --> 43:50.633
But if you need faith,

43:52.009 --> 43:53.642
how many more
would sell your soul?

43:57.738 --> 43:59.369
Now comes the hard part.

44:01.065 --> 44:02.377
Her mother's sick.

44:02.409 --> 44:03.593
No other relatives?

44:06.857 --> 44:09.033
I don't know
what you want.

44:09.065 --> 44:11.689
I know this is
very premature,

44:11.721 --> 44:15.817
but if Ana goes into
a vegetative state,

44:15.849 --> 44:20.329
she becomes just a body
connected to machine.

44:20.361 --> 44:23.658
Would she like us to sustain
her life by artificial means?

44:26.121 --> 44:27.690
You gotta be
fucking kidding me, right?

44:27.722 --> 44:29.353
'Cause...
Don't get me wrong...

44:30.921 --> 44:34.249
You realize there are
many people she could help.

44:39.146 --> 44:42.409
If you so much
as fucking touch her...

44:45.417 --> 44:47.562
You have a problem with
aggression, Mr. Dawkins.

45:05.961 --> 45:07.369
You can't breathe in here.

45:10.569 --> 45:12.169
Let's get you some air.

45:31.561 --> 45:32.585
<i>Where's Tom?</i>

45:35.273 --> 45:36.714
He took
his things and left.

45:44.394 --> 45:45.801
I was just packing.

45:48.362 --> 45:50.025
I'll go with Tom.

45:50.057 --> 45:51.882
I just need to speak
to him first.

45:54.665 --> 45:56.457
Can you please
bring me my phone?

46:00.746 --> 46:04.137
Richard, I'm sorry...

46:04.169 --> 46:05.993
for him and everything.

46:10.025 --> 46:13.065
I met you.
So it's worth it.

46:31.370 --> 46:32.426
I'm sorry.

47:01.194 --> 47:02.505
<i>Who is he?</i>

47:06.058 --> 47:08.297
You must be joking,
Mr. Dawkins.

47:08.329 --> 47:10.345
- Get back to your bed.
- Who is he?

47:10.377 --> 47:11.497
Who?

47:11.529 --> 47:13.513
The man in the bed
next to Ana. Who is he?

47:14.634 --> 47:16.393
He's a patient.

47:16.426 --> 47:19.177
And we don't divulge
personal information.

47:19.209 --> 47:21.290
I saw him when
I was in my coma.

47:21.322 --> 47:22.761
What's strange about that?

47:22.793 --> 47:25.130
You saw his face while
you were still in shock,

47:25.162 --> 47:26.889
straight after awakening.

47:26.921 --> 47:28.138
So how did I know his name?

47:29.737 --> 47:32.393
It's written for
everyone to see.

47:32.425 --> 47:33.513
On his hand.

47:33.545 --> 47:34.601
Please...

47:35.850 --> 47:38.377
just move Ana to my room.

47:38.409 --> 47:40.073
There's nobody else
in there anyway.

47:40.105 --> 47:41.482
No.

47:41.514 --> 47:44.713
She's in a coma.
She stays in a coma room.

47:44.745 --> 47:45.993
You're not in a coma.

47:46.601 --> 47:48.074
You stay in a normal room.

47:50.665 --> 47:53.898
I still have no information
regarding your insurance, by the way.

48:19.017 --> 48:21.161
You have to go
to your room.

48:21.897 --> 48:23.529
It's been three hours.

48:26.602 --> 48:28.297
Propofol?

48:28.329 --> 48:29.833
But the doctor mentioned...

48:32.905 --> 48:34.186
you'd die if you took it.

48:35.977 --> 48:37.226
Only if you overdose.

48:38.729 --> 48:39.946
Why are you asking?

49:30.986 --> 49:32.425
How are you feeling?

49:37.641 --> 49:39.145
I have to go back.

49:45.130 --> 49:47.561
You know, you can stay here
for as long as you want.

49:49.801 --> 49:51.689
That doesn't feel right.

49:52.938 --> 49:54.505
I feel so confused.

49:56.682 --> 49:58.185
I need to call my mother.

49:59.305 --> 50:00.554
I need to see her.

50:02.249 --> 50:03.402
She needs me.

50:07.562 --> 50:09.226
Do you have
a return ticket?

50:15.689 --> 50:17.961
I have to pay you for the
work you've done, so...

50:19.017 --> 50:20.265
you have money.

50:21.706 --> 50:24.425
Yes, we'll finish
tomorrow.

50:32.041 --> 50:33.098
Are you okay?

50:36.777 --> 50:39.625
Yeah.
I just feel very cold.

50:48.105 --> 50:49.514
I think
I'm gonna go to bed.

50:51.530 --> 50:53.128
You shouldn't
stay out too late.

51:30.122 --> 51:31.305
Shit.

53:25.642 --> 53:27.658
I'm so sorry
I left you there.

54:48.745 --> 54:49.737
Ana.

54:55.274 --> 54:56.681
Go back to your room.

54:57.450 --> 54:59.561
Get out. <i>Allez!</i>

55:00.170 --> 55:01.833
- Fuck off me.
- Move.

55:23.114 --> 55:24.617
A grown man.

55:26.281 --> 55:28.137
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

55:34.890 --> 55:37.770
We are a hospital
with weak security.

55:37.801 --> 55:39.594
I know there's something
going on here.

55:39.625 --> 55:41.897
There is?

55:41.929 --> 55:44.042
Apart from you sneaking
around like a burglar

55:44.073 --> 55:46.185
and sleeping in
other patients' beds?

55:46.218 --> 55:47.209
"Other patient"?

55:47.882 --> 55:49.257
It's my fucking girlfriend.

55:50.698 --> 55:52.553
When I was asleep next to her,
I swear to God...

55:52.586 --> 55:53.738
Now seriously...

55:55.402 --> 55:56.937
do you want me
to call the authorities?

56:04.169 --> 56:05.929
Sign on the dotted lines.

56:07.209 --> 56:10.058
You release this hospital
from all responsibilities

56:10.089 --> 56:12.042
and demand an
immediate discharge.

56:16.617 --> 56:17.609
No.

56:18.762 --> 56:20.233
No, I'm not signing that.

56:20.266 --> 56:22.346
You can still
visit your girlfriend.

56:22.377 --> 56:24.585
For now, I just don't
want you staying here.

56:24.618 --> 56:26.089
You're making our job harder.

56:31.178 --> 56:32.329
I'm still sick.

56:34.762 --> 56:36.617
You can't just
make me leave.

56:36.649 --> 56:39.945
If you're worried about your health,
there are hospitals in prisons.

56:39.978 --> 56:41.929
What, you send people to prison
for things like that?

56:41.961 --> 56:44.233
If they break into
confidential areas first

56:44.266 --> 56:46.729
and steal life-threatening
medication, why not?

56:49.289 --> 56:50.442
Yes.

56:51.561 --> 56:53.033
That's on record, too.

57:29.609 --> 57:30.762
Come in.

57:38.282 --> 57:39.561
Breakfast is served.

57:45.993 --> 57:46.985
<i>Voila.</i>

57:48.169 --> 57:49.706
I dreamt about Tom.

57:51.753 --> 57:52.938
He was so weak.

57:53.802 --> 57:56.585
Also bruises here and here.

58:02.089 --> 58:04.169
Probably just
a magnesium deficiency.

58:05.129 --> 58:06.409
Nothing to worry about.

58:07.849 --> 58:09.065
I'll give you
some supplements.

58:11.945 --> 58:13.065
You're not hungry?

58:16.617 --> 58:18.698
I just want to go
to the lavender field.

58:22.249 --> 58:23.529
Are you afraid
of that place?

58:25.353 --> 58:28.873
Let's finish
the garden first, hmm?

58:28.906 --> 58:30.282
It's going to rain
all next week.

58:32.394 --> 58:34.058
And one other thing,

58:34.089 --> 58:36.938
I'm beginning to look
a little bit like a vagrant.

58:36.969 --> 58:38.666
And Freddie's
a terrible barber.

58:43.753 --> 58:44.874
Thank you.

1:00:08.490 --> 1:00:09.866
Yeah, it's ready.

1:00:09.897 --> 1:00:12.233
Papa is going to be
a handsome man again.

1:01:42.185 --> 1:01:45.673
The fucking psycho liked to
play doctor when he was little.

1:01:48.266 --> 1:01:50.761
This place is perfect.

1:01:50.793 --> 1:01:52.713
I don't think
the roses will grow here.

1:01:53.545 --> 1:01:54.922
It's too shaded.

1:01:54.954 --> 1:01:56.649
Come on.
They'll grow just fine.

1:01:56.682 --> 1:01:59.562
No, if you really want the rose
garden you've always dreamed of,

1:01:59.593 --> 1:02:01.193
over there would be
the best place.

1:02:10.057 --> 1:02:12.137
They're always
bullying that one.

1:02:16.681 --> 1:02:18.058
Why won't you defend him?

1:02:19.785 --> 1:02:20.938
That would be the stupidest,

1:02:20.970 --> 1:02:22.665
most dangerous thing
you could do.

1:02:23.754 --> 1:02:25.993
Never get between them.
Promise me.

1:02:28.073 --> 1:02:30.825
Even I don't try to separate
the dogs when they're fighting.

1:02:53.993 --> 1:02:55.977
No graves in the real garden.

1:03:07.401 --> 1:03:08.425
Hey.

1:03:09.609 --> 1:03:10.633
Yo!

1:03:12.746 --> 1:03:15.369
Here. Yeah. Uh...

1:03:16.458 --> 1:03:17.578
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1:03:20.041 --> 1:03:21.033
Hey.

1:03:22.378 --> 1:03:24.521
<i>Bonjour.</i> Uh...

1:03:25.705 --> 1:03:29.449
Are there any lavender fields
around here?

1:03:30.569 --> 1:03:31.754
Lavender?

1:03:33.257 --> 1:03:35.626
- Ah. <i>La lavande?</i>
- Yes.

1:03:42.442 --> 1:03:44.745
Yeah. In the south?

1:03:44.777 --> 1:03:46.729
Not here. There's no
lavender fields here?

1:03:48.330 --> 1:03:49.897
Okay. Um...

1:03:51.050 --> 1:03:52.521
Are there any graves?

1:03:54.409 --> 1:03:55.497
Graves, like...

1:03:57.674 --> 1:04:00.137
Um, dogs?

1:04:05.065 --> 1:04:07.049
Yes.

1:04:12.266 --> 1:04:14.889
Okay. I...
Yeah, I get it.

1:04:35.210 --> 1:04:36.777
You should have names.

1:04:36.809 --> 1:04:38.601
Big beasts.

1:04:42.537 --> 1:04:43.914
Bobo.

1:04:43.946 --> 1:04:45.802
Oh. Fast and furious.

1:04:46.730 --> 1:04:48.329
Mika.

1:04:51.562 --> 1:04:55.913
Mm. Poor little
non-alpha male.

1:04:55.945 --> 1:05:00.010
You should be called Susu.

1:05:07.497 --> 1:05:09.578
Hey. Hey.

1:05:11.433 --> 1:05:14.185
Everything is the same.
Just like I saw in my coma.

1:05:14.217 --> 1:05:15.498
Fascinating.

1:05:17.577 --> 1:05:19.977
I don't give a fuck if you
find it fascinating.

1:05:20.009 --> 1:05:21.705
The fact is that
we were trapped in there,

1:05:21.737 --> 1:05:23.178
and now she's in there alone.
So why don't you just

1:05:23.210 --> 1:05:24.970
- fucking listen to me?
- Enough!

1:05:25.513 --> 1:05:27.050
I have a hospital to run.

1:05:33.578 --> 1:05:36.458
Hey! Hey, fuck you!

1:05:47.978 --> 1:05:49.161
Can I see your photo?

1:05:53.961 --> 1:05:58.313
So... he was
telling the truth.

1:06:00.586 --> 1:06:01.674
Who?

1:06:25.418 --> 1:06:27.241
He had pictures like these
in his house.

1:06:29.322 --> 1:06:30.761
Where'd you get them?

1:06:32.266 --> 1:06:34.314
One year ago, we had a boy.

1:06:36.074 --> 1:06:38.825
He was in a coma
after a bicycle accident.

1:06:41.034 --> 1:06:42.826
Adrian Bosolei.

1:06:44.746 --> 1:06:47.369
When he woke up, he said

1:06:47.402 --> 1:06:51.048
he had been in a house
with a man and his dogs.

1:06:51.594 --> 1:06:53.162
Just like you.

1:06:54.250 --> 1:06:55.434
I have to talk to him.

1:06:57.226 --> 1:06:59.785
Two weeks
after he left hospital,

1:06:59.817 --> 1:07:03.081
he died suddenly
of a brain aneurysm.

1:07:06.377 --> 1:07:08.714
Who is this Richard Rolle?

1:07:08.746 --> 1:07:11.434
He made his money
on new brain scanners.

1:07:13.193 --> 1:07:16.330
Four years ago, he called for
help and he was almost dead.

1:07:17.354 --> 1:07:18.857
And they brought him here.

1:07:19.466 --> 1:07:21.768
What happened to him?

1:07:21.801 --> 1:07:25.512
Police said that...
his dogs...

1:07:27.050 --> 1:07:28.392
Attacked him?

1:07:31.914 --> 1:07:34.442
Oh, Jesus! Fuck!

1:07:34.474 --> 1:07:38.697
Tom... Even if these dogs
are there, it's just a dream.

1:07:38.730 --> 1:07:40.234
Yeah, but they are there.

1:07:42.345 --> 1:07:44.170
Fuck, how could I be
so fucking stupid?

1:07:46.728 --> 1:07:47.914
Okay.

1:07:49.994 --> 1:07:51.882
So how did they, um,

1:07:51.914 --> 1:07:54.602
wake up this, uh, Adrian?

1:07:56.361 --> 1:07:58.313
His parents

1:07:58.345 --> 1:08:01.161
were sitting in his bed
and talking to him

1:08:01.193 --> 1:08:03.274
about his life
for hours,

1:08:04.298 --> 1:08:06.122
as if they were living it
once again.

1:08:08.074 --> 1:08:09.672
Baptiste laughed at them,
but...

1:08:10.250 --> 1:08:11.978
maybe it worked.

1:08:12.010 --> 1:08:13.577
Yeah, maybe.

1:08:17.865 --> 1:08:19.529
Please...

1:08:20.618 --> 1:08:23.112
Please, will you
help me move her?

1:08:24.522 --> 1:08:28.330
Listen, you can always try to
move her to America.

1:08:30.058 --> 1:08:31.497
Why don't you
call the embassy?

1:08:35.752 --> 1:08:37.257
Because I'm on probation,

1:08:39.850 --> 1:08:41.321
and I left
without permission.

1:08:43.401 --> 1:08:44.714
That's why.

1:08:51.338 --> 1:08:52.968
Hey there,
trouble-maker.

1:08:54.378 --> 1:08:56.009
How're you doing?

1:08:58.410 --> 1:08:59.978
Yeah, me too.

1:09:07.946 --> 1:09:09.738
I don't know
if this is gonna work.

1:09:13.641 --> 1:09:15.081
Here goes.

1:09:22.377 --> 1:09:24.042
Your name is Ana Walker.

1:09:26.633 --> 1:09:28.586
<i>Your father died when
you were ten.</i>

1:09:32.618 --> 1:09:34.409
<i>You've missed him
every day since.</i>

1:09:41.897 --> 1:09:43.178
I can't.

1:09:47.018 --> 1:09:48.585
I need more time.

1:09:51.241 --> 1:09:52.809
What is time?

1:09:56.265 --> 1:09:57.738
What is time?

1:09:57.770 --> 1:09:59.498
When you were 12,

1:10:00.650 --> 1:10:02.538
you went to sleep one night,

1:10:02.570 --> 1:10:06.474
and all of a sudden
you felt this...

1:10:08.265 --> 1:10:09.802
wave of dread.

1:10:10.826 --> 1:10:11.882
I love you.

1:10:12.809 --> 1:10:14.058
I love you.

1:10:16.618 --> 1:10:19.754
<i>Couldn't move,
couldn't breathe.</i>

1:10:21.674 --> 1:10:23.338
<i>You always said that</i>

1:10:24.618 --> 1:10:26.409
<i>that was the moment you</i>

1:10:27.594 --> 1:10:31.178
<i>learned what it meant
to die.</i>

1:10:31.209 --> 1:10:32.745
I'll care for you forever.

1:10:33.866 --> 1:10:35.305
<i>You have a boyfriend and...</i>

1:10:37.194 --> 1:10:38.762
It's me, by the way.

1:10:43.722 --> 1:10:45.322
And he loves you.

1:10:49.705 --> 1:10:51.912
He loves you more than
anything in the world.

1:10:58.377 --> 1:10:59.818
It's just...

1:11:05.034 --> 1:11:06.858
You know, I wish
you could hear me.

1:11:06.890 --> 1:11:08.329
I really do.

1:11:09.930 --> 1:11:12.554
Just give me a sign,
just... anything.

1:11:12.937 --> 1:11:14.345
Please, Ana.

1:11:23.882 --> 1:11:25.898
What...

1:11:29.482 --> 1:11:30.633
Ana!

1:11:41.610 --> 1:11:43.305
No, no, no, no.

1:11:44.906 --> 1:11:46.218
Oh!

1:11:49.290 --> 1:11:50.698
Ana, please.
Come on, wake up.

1:11:50.729 --> 1:11:52.137
Wake up Ana, come on.

1:11:52.553 --> 1:11:54.313
Ana, wake up!

1:12:24.137 --> 1:12:26.921
Get the fuck off me!

1:12:32.169 --> 1:12:35.722
Unlawful use of a taser with
exposure of hospital personnel

1:12:35.753 --> 1:12:37.769
- to direct threat of life.
- Fuck you!

1:12:37.802 --> 1:12:39.849
Don't you come anywhere
fucking near me.

1:12:41.417 --> 1:12:43.881
He's killing her.
He's sucking the life out of her.

1:12:43.914 --> 1:12:45.674
What is it that
you don't understand?

1:12:45.705 --> 1:12:48.073
You'll land up in prison,
Mr. Dawkins.

1:12:48.106 --> 1:12:49.322
The police are coming.

1:12:50.634 --> 1:12:51.977
Prison?

1:12:54.057 --> 1:12:55.753
This is prison.

1:12:58.505 --> 1:13:00.009
I'm coming for you.

1:13:19.209 --> 1:13:23.274
<i>Hi. You've reached the Inpatient
Psychiatry Unit at Memorial Hospital.</i>

1:13:23.305 --> 1:13:24.938
<i>Please leave
your name and number</i>

1:13:24.969 --> 1:13:27.593
<i>and we will get back to you
as soon as possible.</i>

1:13:37.129 --> 1:13:38.313
Tom?

1:13:42.921 --> 1:13:44.202
Tom!

1:13:54.825 --> 1:13:57.513
<i>Arret!</i> Freddie, <i>arret!</i>

1:13:57.545 --> 1:13:59.146
Hey, Freddie, stop!

1:14:00.745 --> 1:14:04.169
It's him...

1:14:04.202 --> 1:14:08.169
Tom. He... He was there!
Out there in the field, going away.

1:14:08.202 --> 1:14:11.113
He looked like...
like a ghost.

1:14:11.145 --> 1:14:12.681
What are you
talking about?

1:14:12.713 --> 1:14:16.586
I feel something bad
happened to him.

1:14:17.386 --> 1:14:19.049
Please, let me go there.

1:14:19.081 --> 1:14:21.801
- I have to... I have to see him.
- Wait.

1:14:24.745 --> 1:14:27.465
Why don't you call him?

1:14:27.498 --> 1:14:29.033
Call him.

1:14:41.833 --> 1:14:43.593
<i>Fuck off already!</i>

1:15:21.482 --> 1:15:25.257
"Your"? When will you learn
how to spell, dummy?

1:16:23.465 --> 1:16:25.033
He was stealing, Ana.

1:16:26.442 --> 1:16:29.865
- I... I, I was just looking...
- It doesn't matter.

1:16:32.169 --> 1:16:34.057
You can do whatever
you like around here.

1:16:35.209 --> 1:16:36.905
This is your home too, now.

1:16:38.985 --> 1:16:40.457
What do you need?

1:16:44.042 --> 1:16:46.473
I'm just getting
a bit restless.

1:16:46.505 --> 1:16:47.818
I would like to take a walk.

1:16:49.545 --> 1:16:52.201
- So take a walk.
- Outside.

1:16:55.498 --> 1:16:57.354
You mean, to the village?

1:16:57.386 --> 1:16:59.721
The village, the fields.

1:17:00.969 --> 1:17:05.513
I need to be alone by myself
in any environment.

1:17:05.546 --> 1:17:09.834
I'm sorry, but...
I've lost the remote.

1:17:09.866 --> 1:17:12.585
That's fine.
I can climb the wall.

1:17:17.066 --> 1:17:18.474
Don't look at me like that.

1:17:19.562 --> 1:17:21.257
I'm not doing
anything wrong.

1:17:45.065 --> 1:17:48.713
Police?

1:17:56.938 --> 1:17:59.113
I think I'm being kept
against my will

1:17:59.145 --> 1:18:00.682
in the house of Richard Raw.

1:18:06.185 --> 1:18:08.073
I think he might have
killed my boyfriend.

1:18:21.962 --> 1:18:24.105
Ana!

1:18:24.457 --> 1:18:25.993
Ana!

1:19:40.490 --> 1:19:42.121
<i>Trois, deux, un.</i>

1:19:49.066 --> 1:19:50.441
Come.

1:19:53.481 --> 1:19:55.465
- <i>Are we dead?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

1:19:56.714 --> 1:19:59.273
<i>Our brains are just functioning
on a different mode.</i>

1:19:59.305 --> 1:20:00.586
<i>Sleeping and dreaming.</i>

1:20:01.449 --> 1:20:03.017
<i>I want to wake up.</i>

1:20:04.105 --> 1:20:05.386
<i>But you can't.</i>

1:20:06.825 --> 1:20:08.234
<i>What is outside?</i>

1:20:08.266 --> 1:20:10.025
<i>Your juvenile boyfriend?</i>

1:20:10.057 --> 1:20:11.945
<i>Poverty? Your mad mother?</i>

1:20:12.969 --> 1:20:14.986
Outside, you're sick
and wounded.

1:20:16.521 --> 1:20:20.682
Inside me, in this house,
you're safe.

1:20:23.305 --> 1:20:24.682
There's no passage of time.

1:20:25.642 --> 1:20:27.048
But I want to
see the world,

1:20:29.225 --> 1:20:30.506
have experiences.

1:20:33.258 --> 1:20:34.985
I feel suffocated in here.

1:20:36.713 --> 1:20:38.601
I have so many dreams.

1:20:55.434 --> 1:20:56.905
How did you get in here?

1:21:01.194 --> 1:21:04.042
Your dogs. They killed you.

1:21:04.074 --> 1:21:05.481
I am not dead.

1:21:06.762 --> 1:21:08.553
So no one killed me.

1:21:08.585 --> 1:21:10.538
They assaulted you
like they did Susu.

1:21:11.754 --> 1:21:13.289
That's why
they have no names.

1:21:16.586 --> 1:21:20.266
- It was my fault.
- What are you talking about?

1:21:22.282 --> 1:21:24.553
I tried to separate them
when they were fighting.

1:21:25.290 --> 1:21:26.761
And they turned on me.

1:21:28.457 --> 1:21:29.802
I should have known better.

1:21:33.706 --> 1:21:35.401
If we're in your head...

1:21:37.641 --> 1:21:40.169
Our brains are
synchronized at the same frequency,

1:21:42.185 --> 1:21:43.848
like radio waves.

1:21:46.442 --> 1:21:50.121
But this is your world,
not mine.

1:21:51.978 --> 1:21:53.994
Can you imagine...

1:21:54.026 --> 1:21:55.977
living here
alone in this house...

1:21:56.937 --> 1:21:58.345
all these years?

1:21:59.690 --> 1:22:02.666
I was rotting in the hospital,
trapped in my own body,

1:22:02.697 --> 1:22:04.265
trying to contact someone.

1:22:05.450 --> 1:22:06.888
Anyone.

1:22:07.530 --> 1:22:09.258
So I'm your entertainment.

1:22:21.514 --> 1:22:25.514
My first success was
getting my dogs back.

1:22:26.762 --> 1:22:28.586
I'd already
dug their graves.

1:22:30.250 --> 1:22:33.321
I could hear them
shooting them one by one

1:22:33.354 --> 1:22:35.050
as the paramedics
took me away.

1:22:37.322 --> 1:22:39.081
And then one day,
they came back to me.

1:22:48.105 --> 1:22:50.248
There was a boy.

1:22:50.282 --> 1:22:52.105
He was in a coma
in San Juan Hospital.

1:22:54.250 --> 1:22:56.105
I could feel his presence
so close to me.

1:22:58.281 --> 1:23:01.705
And then one day,
he appeared.

1:23:03.528 --> 1:23:04.906
What happened to him?

1:23:06.730 --> 1:23:08.201
I had to watch him go.

1:23:13.257 --> 1:23:14.921
Can't you make me go?

1:23:17.033 --> 1:23:18.537
If you really love me.

1:23:24.010 --> 1:23:25.705
You don't understand.

1:23:27.657 --> 1:23:31.562
It is either here or nowhere.

1:23:39.113 --> 1:23:40.521
I have a gift for you.

1:25:08.265 --> 1:25:09.801
One...

1:25:11.721 --> 1:25:13.097
two...

1:25:14.186 --> 1:25:15.594
three...

1:25:52.714 --> 1:25:54.025
What have you done!

1:25:57.001 --> 1:26:00.362
Oh, what have you done?

1:26:05.162 --> 1:26:06.474
This is a crime.

1:26:08.042 --> 1:26:09.736
Even a life like this
is sacred.

1:26:12.713 --> 1:26:15.401
Whoever wants to save
his life will lose it.

1:26:17.385 --> 1:26:18.825
You know what we have
in common?

1:26:23.145 --> 1:26:24.650
We're both fighting
for survival.

1:26:27.465 --> 1:26:29.258
I don't wanna
live like this.

1:26:42.121 --> 1:26:44.905
Ana. Dinner is ready.

1:26:47.306 --> 1:26:49.992
Hey, what's up, buddy? Mm?

1:26:51.561 --> 1:26:55.082
Don't worry. Everything is
going to be fine.

1:26:57.194 --> 1:26:58.601
Ana!

1:27:39.113 --> 1:27:40.362
You're not hungry.

1:27:47.753 --> 1:27:49.034
Very well.

1:28:07.561 --> 1:28:08.906
Don't!

1:28:16.009 --> 1:28:17.705
What an asshole.

1:28:22.186 --> 1:28:24.714
- They'll kill him!
- They will kill you if you come between them.

1:28:26.442 --> 1:28:28.137
I'm already dead.

1:28:32.490 --> 1:28:34.857
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone.

1:28:38.185 --> 1:28:39.689
So I'm your entertainment.

1:28:44.649 --> 1:28:46.602
I think he might have
killed my boyfriend.

1:28:49.162 --> 1:28:51.305
Freddie, no!

1:28:53.225 --> 1:28:55.113
<i>I love you.</i>

1:28:55.145 --> 1:28:56.457
I love you.

1:29:08.937 --> 1:29:10.282
Oh, my boy.

1:29:19.561 --> 1:29:21.225
You will never wake up.

1:29:23.082 --> 1:29:25.802
Look at you.
With your varicose veins

1:29:25.833 --> 1:29:27.753
and your white hair
and your bruises,

1:29:28.938 --> 1:29:30.762
you'll rot away in your bed.

1:29:30.793 --> 1:29:32.393
That will be your freedom.

1:29:37.513 --> 1:29:39.049
Get her.

1:29:41.385 --> 1:29:42.761
Get her!

1:29:43.913 --> 1:29:45.321
You don't even
know their names.

1:29:47.241 --> 1:29:49.737
Bobo, Mika, Susu.

1:31:53.449 --> 1:31:54.762
Tom.

1:32:17.162 --> 1:32:19.689
- You have to live, Ana.
- No.

1:32:29.353 --> 1:32:30.857
No.

1:32:32.393 --> 1:32:34.122
No.
