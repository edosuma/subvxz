00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.479 --> 00:09.980
I heard an explosion.

00:09.980 --> 00:11.542
Did we get attacked by
shape-shifters again?

00:11.542 --> 00:13.013
( startled gasp )

00:13.013 --> 00:16.547
No, but could you cover up?

00:16.547 --> 00:19.550
I'm seeing a few too many
shapes shifting over there.

00:21.292 --> 00:22.993
What happened?

00:22.993 --> 00:26.297
I'm guessing a combination
of gravity and middle age.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.660
To that.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.502
Oh, well, um,

00:31.502 --> 00:33.634
Oliver and Chase were
talking about science,

00:33.634 --> 00:36.267
I got bored,
I yawned,

00:36.267 --> 00:38.008
something flew
out of my mouth,

00:38.008 --> 00:40.010
and voila,
I set the table on fire.

00:41.312 --> 00:44.975
He found another super power.
It's a fire grenade.

00:44.975 --> 00:47.618
Fire grenade?
That's lame.

00:47.618 --> 00:50.621
I'm calling it
my yawn bomb.

00:50.621 --> 00:53.254
Yeah, 'cause that's
much better.

00:54.985 --> 00:56.957
So wait, you just
discovered something

00:56.957 --> 00:59.430
you didn't even
know you had?

00:59.430 --> 01:01.362
How many powers
were in that space rock?

01:01.362 --> 01:02.963
That's tough to say.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.695
It didn't really
come with a manual.

01:04.695 --> 01:07.238
And even if it did,
I probably wouldn't read it.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.442
This is just like you guys
when you unlocked

01:11.442 --> 01:13.374
new bionic abilities.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.546
Oh, yeah.
Except that our abilities

01:15.546 --> 01:18.349
come from a highly
advanced infrastructure,

01:18.349 --> 01:20.781
and theirs come from
a magic witch pebble.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.184
Whoooo!

01:24.685 --> 01:27.458
Either way, this is a great
opportunity for the team.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.120
We can teach them
to hone their abilities

01:29.120 --> 01:31.122
the way I trained you.

01:31.122 --> 01:33.023
Superhero school.
That sounds like fun.

01:33.023 --> 01:36.727
School?
Ugh, boring!

01:45.736 --> 01:49.140
Well, that's the last time
that umbrella stand attacks us.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.760
Good news, ladies.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.062
I'm about to teach my first
class of superhero school.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.564
- I'm out.
- Right behind you.

02:45.596 --> 02:47.768
Okay, guys, I will
be your instructor,

02:47.768 --> 02:49.940
and Chase will be
my apprentice.

02:49.940 --> 02:52.142
What? Why am I
the apprentice?

02:52.142 --> 02:54.445
Because you don't know
anything about superheroes.

02:54.445 --> 02:55.746
Oh, and you do?

02:55.746 --> 02:58.749
Hello! I'm
Donald Davenport.

02:58.749 --> 03:02.453
Just because you wear
disturbingly tight unitards

03:02.453 --> 03:04.285
does not make you
a superhero.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.957
You ever try
fitting into them?

03:06.957 --> 03:08.489
Yes, it does.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.622
Okay, Kaz,
let's start your training

03:11.622 --> 03:14.665
by giving your fire grenades
another go.

03:14.665 --> 03:16.727
I want you
to use your grenades

03:16.727 --> 03:18.899
to hit the bottle
in the middle

03:18.899 --> 03:20.671
and leave the others
untouched.

03:20.671 --> 03:21.902
Got it.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.034
You might wanna
back up.

03:24.034 --> 03:27.077
When it comes to
learning, Kaz doesn't.

03:31.682 --> 03:34.915
- Whoa!
- You did it.

03:34.915 --> 03:38.148
Yeah. If our enemies are
16-ounce bottles of water,

03:38.148 --> 03:40.150
I think I'm ready.

03:40.150 --> 03:43.494
Great job.
Okay, Oliver, you're up.

03:43.494 --> 03:46.096
Now since you have ice-
and water-based abilities,

03:46.096 --> 03:47.498
I want you to use
your cryo blast

03:47.498 --> 03:49.460
to freeze the bottle
on the left.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.031
No problemo, teach.

03:58.269 --> 04:00.741
Is that an ice cube?

04:02.443 --> 04:05.516
I don't know
what that was.

04:05.516 --> 04:07.648
Let me try again.

04:15.686 --> 04:18.389
Okay, yeah,
that was an ice cube.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.562
I don't get it.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.093
It worked fine
when you froze

04:23.093 --> 04:24.765
Roman and Riker's
black swarm.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.937
- Try to focus.
- I am focusing.

04:26.937 --> 04:30.270
- Well, focus harder.
- How about you go
stand over there harder?!

04:43.213 --> 04:44.985
Oh, come on!

04:44.985 --> 04:47.217
I don't know whether
to train him

04:47.217 --> 04:49.660
or call the refrigerator
repairman.

04:51.221 --> 04:53.324
It's okay, Oliver.
We'll fix it.

04:53.324 --> 04:56.196
Kaz, why don't we see
how your grenades
handle rapid fire.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.729
I mean, I haven't
really tried it before,

04:58.729 --> 05:01.131
but I imagine it goes
something like this.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.738
Wow!
You're a natural.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.743
And Oliver, you're
leaking all over my floor.

05:17.047 --> 05:20.090
So, how do you like
Centium City?

05:20.090 --> 05:22.823
It's great, but it's
kind of overwhelming.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.096
I mean, I'm just
a small-town alien girl.

05:26.096 --> 05:30.300
Yeah, that's never gonna
stop sounding weird.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.302
What I mean is,

05:32.302 --> 05:34.365
I've been to school,
but I haven't experienced

05:34.365 --> 05:36.036
much of the real world.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.838
Me neither.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.210
I couldn't be
more socially awkward.

05:40.210 --> 05:43.544
And I don't know why
I'm so excited about that.

05:45.816 --> 05:47.378
This is gonna be
so great.

05:47.378 --> 05:49.720
I finally have
another girl around.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.453
You're like
the sister I never had.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.324
Well, I mean,
Chase acts like
an old lady,

05:54.324 --> 05:56.126
but it's not
the same.

05:56.126 --> 05:59.460
Wait. You think of me
as a sister?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.792
Of course I do.
Bring it in.

06:06.797 --> 06:08.098
What are you doing?

06:08.098 --> 06:10.070
Having fun
with my new sis.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.772
Ow!

06:11.772 --> 06:13.203
( bones crack )

06:13.203 --> 06:15.706
Aw, your tiny bone pops
are adorable.

06:15.706 --> 06:17.778
Ow, okay!

06:20.611 --> 06:23.584
Hey, Chase.
Can we talk,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.355
smart guy
to smart guy?

06:25.355 --> 06:29.720
Well, we can talk
smart guy to smartest guy.

06:30.821 --> 06:32.322
What's up?

06:32.322 --> 06:35.526
I'm just not getting
this whole superhero thing.

06:35.526 --> 06:37.428
Yeah, me neither.

06:37.428 --> 06:39.299
We've been over this.
Magic witch pebble.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.031
Whoooo!

06:41.031 --> 06:43.103
No.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.035
I mean, when I used
my cryo blast

06:45.035 --> 06:47.608
to freeze the black swarm,
it worked perfectly.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.740
But earlier today,
I was--

06:49.740 --> 06:51.782
- A dud?
- I was gonna say--

06:51.782 --> 06:53.183
- A failure.
- No, I was thinking--

06:53.183 --> 06:55.415
- A disaster.
- Would you let me finish?!

06:57.688 --> 06:59.289
It's weird.

06:59.289 --> 07:01.251
In school, I always
picked up things quickly,

07:01.251 --> 07:03.423
but for some reason,
I just...

07:03.423 --> 07:05.225
I can't figure out
these powers.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.958
Something's off.

07:07.958 --> 07:10.060
I think I know
what's off.

07:10.060 --> 07:12.132
Your world is
upside down

07:12.132 --> 07:14.434
'cause you're usually
the A student,

07:14.434 --> 07:16.537
and Kaz is
the F student.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.039
It's psyching you out that
he's better at this than you.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.572
What? No, that's crazy.

07:21.572 --> 07:23.343
He is not better than me,

07:23.343 --> 07:25.045
despite all
the overwhelming evidence

07:25.045 --> 07:27.748
that says otherwise.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.219
I just need your help.

07:29.219 --> 07:32.082
Okay. Maybe you just
need some practice.

07:32.082 --> 07:34.154
We can focus on
one of your other powers.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.586
It might be easier for you.

07:35.586 --> 07:37.728
Yes, that's
a great idea.

07:37.728 --> 07:40.060
Ooh, I have another
super power that shoots

07:40.060 --> 07:41.632
a water vortex
from my hand.

07:41.632 --> 07:44.094
I call it...
cyclone fingers.

07:44.094 --> 07:45.636
( chuckling )

07:45.636 --> 07:47.598
Wait.

07:47.598 --> 07:50.300
You dispense ice
and water?

07:50.300 --> 07:54.144
Do you also have
a vegetable crisper?

07:57.778 --> 07:59.950
I think just one more
should do it.

08:03.053 --> 08:04.384
There you go.

08:06.817 --> 08:11.421
Wow! I am
smokin' hot.

08:11.421 --> 08:14.494
You know, I don't think
that's gonna come off.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.166
Nor should it.

08:19.169 --> 08:21.972
- Quick, help me!
- Wait, what's going on?

08:23.674 --> 08:26.837
That's gonna
come off, right?

08:26.837 --> 08:30.140
I told Skylar
she was like a sister to me,

08:30.140 --> 08:32.412
and then,
out of nowhere,

08:32.412 --> 08:34.585
she started throwing me around
like Adam does with Chase.

08:34.585 --> 08:36.647
She gave me a wedgie.

08:36.647 --> 08:39.219
Girls don't do that.

08:39.219 --> 08:43.123
( laughs )
Yeah.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.126
( mocking laughter )
Yeah, what?

08:46.126 --> 08:49.560
That's how all the girls
on Skylar's planet are.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.662
Yeah, they're beautiful
and friendly,

08:51.662 --> 08:54.004
and incredibly violent.

08:54.004 --> 08:56.536
They treat each other
like brothers.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.669
I know it seems weird,
but she's acting like that

08:58.669 --> 09:00.040
because she's
bonding with you.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.142
( chuckles )
That's great.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.575
You know, all I ever
wanted was a sister,

09:04.575 --> 09:07.377
but instead, I get
a steel cage she-beast

09:07.377 --> 09:09.650
that assaults me
in my own home.

09:10.881 --> 09:13.684
She's coming!
Hide me!

09:13.684 --> 09:16.056
You have
an invisibility app.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.187
Right.

09:20.190 --> 09:22.693
Hey, guys.

09:22.693 --> 09:28.098
Oh, I think Bree
wants to play another game.

09:28.098 --> 09:30.601
I can hear you
breathing.

09:33.303 --> 09:36.476
Wow, she really likes you.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.053
You're doing
great, Oliver.

09:43.053 --> 09:45.155
Maybe I was wrong about
Kaz getting into your head.

09:45.155 --> 09:46.416
Let's try it again.

09:51.061 --> 09:52.993
Okay, that's good.

09:54.164 --> 09:56.096
We're good.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.567
I said we're good!

09:59.499 --> 10:01.632
This is amazing!

10:01.632 --> 10:03.603
Chase, I can't
thank you enough.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.736
Well, there's always money.

10:05.736 --> 10:08.078
Hi, guys.

10:08.078 --> 10:10.410
Oh, hey, Kaz.
What a coincidence.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.383
Chase and I were
just not thinking about you.

10:13.383 --> 10:15.545
What are you guys
doing out here?

10:15.545 --> 10:18.318
Not much. Just perfecting
this super cool new power.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.790
Check it out.

10:19.790 --> 10:22.392
Cyclone fingers.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.231
Uh... Oliver?

10:31.231 --> 10:33.063
Don't worry,
I got this.

10:46.076 --> 10:47.778
That was really good, bud...

10:47.778 --> 10:49.880
up until
that last part.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.422
Mr. Davenport,
are you okay?

10:52.422 --> 10:55.726
Help. I'm hanging on
by a hair.

10:56.887 --> 11:00.831
My luscious,
full-bodied hair.

11:13.804 --> 11:16.646
Help me!

11:16.646 --> 11:18.949
How you doing,
Mr. Davenport?

11:18.949 --> 11:21.952
Speaking of which,
what is he hanging on to?

11:21.952 --> 11:24.785
Uh, that would be
a Daven head.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.458
He put a giant bust
of his own head

11:28.458 --> 11:29.990
on the building?

11:29.990 --> 11:33.463
No. The Daven head
came first.

11:33.463 --> 11:35.195
He built the tower
to support it.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.099
I knew he had
a big head,

11:39.099 --> 11:41.832
but I never thought
it would save his life.

11:41.832 --> 11:44.634
I heard that,
new guy.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.478
Hey, Oliver,
I'm thinking

11:48.478 --> 11:50.781
we should change
the name of your cyclone fingers

11:50.781 --> 11:52.913
to irresponsible
wind of doom.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.686
I thought it was perfected,
and so did he.

11:56.686 --> 11:58.789
Whoa, don't rope me
into this.

11:58.789 --> 12:02.022
I'm still trying
to figure out you super freaks.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.494
I hate to interrupt,

12:04.494 --> 12:07.798
but could one of you heroes
get down here and save me?!

12:09.329 --> 12:12.262
Can you pull yourself
to the top of the head?

12:12.262 --> 12:13.563
I can't get a foothold.

12:13.563 --> 12:15.435
It's too slippery.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.367
My face is too perfect.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.371
Okay, I'll be
right down.

12:21.371 --> 12:23.343
Wait.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.045
What am I saying?

12:25.045 --> 12:27.517
You two can fly.
Get down there and save him.

12:27.517 --> 12:30.250
On second thought,
why don't you go down there

12:30.250 --> 12:33.283
- and save him?
- Why not me?

12:33.283 --> 12:36.556
No offense, but I don't
trust you with your own life.

12:37.928 --> 12:40.290
If Mr. Davenport
needs a cold beverage,

12:40.290 --> 12:43.533
you'll be the first person
I call.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.195
I got this.

12:45.195 --> 12:47.697
No. I got this.

12:47.697 --> 12:50.040
Actually, I can still
hear you,

12:50.040 --> 12:51.571
and my vote's for Kaz.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.204
Or Chase, even though
he can't fly.

12:54.204 --> 12:56.746
Don't worry,
Mr. Davenport.

12:56.746 --> 12:58.348
I'm coming
to save you.

13:03.854 --> 13:06.686
( Oliver screaming )

13:10.360 --> 13:13.063
Sorry. Still working
on the landings.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.066
You know what's weird?

13:16.066 --> 13:19.069
You both look equally
disappointed in me.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.833
We are.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.782
Lost her finally.

13:32.782 --> 13:34.284
( Skylar yelling )

13:36.917 --> 13:38.618
Gotcha!

13:38.618 --> 13:40.090
Okay, that's it.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.024
- Ow, ow, ow!
- ( taps floor )

13:46.426 --> 13:49.799
That really hurt.
Nice.

13:49.799 --> 13:52.432
No, not nice.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.065
Skylar, I can't
do this anymore.

13:55.065 --> 13:56.937
Bree, we're heroes.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.439
"Can't" is not in
our vocabulary.
Let's rumble!

14:00.770 --> 14:03.173
Okay, look, this might
be the way

14:03.173 --> 14:04.674
that you do things
on your planet,

14:04.674 --> 14:06.646
but here, sisters don't
throttle each other

14:06.646 --> 14:08.378
to show their love.

14:08.378 --> 14:10.220
We do it by pretending
to be nice

14:10.220 --> 14:12.052
and talking behind
each other's backs.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.784
Oh, well, I've been
doing that, too.

14:16.186 --> 14:19.029
Bree, I'm sorry,
but I told you.

14:19.029 --> 14:21.261
This is all
really new to me.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.762
The city,
having a sister.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.264
It's okay.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.196
I get it.

14:26.196 --> 14:28.198
This is all
new to me, too.

14:28.198 --> 14:30.000
That's why we're lucky
we have each other,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.502
so we can figure it
all out together.

14:32.502 --> 14:34.004
But I can't do that

14:34.004 --> 14:36.476
if you're pile-driving me
into the floor.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.479
Why didn't you just
say something?

14:39.479 --> 14:42.752
Oh, were my screams
too subtle?

14:42.752 --> 14:44.654
Okay, from now on,

14:44.654 --> 14:46.816
no more physical violence.

14:46.816 --> 14:48.188
Thank you.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.690
- Except once a week?
- No.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.493
- Once a month?
- Not a chance.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.995
Holidays.

14:54.995 --> 14:58.328
- Fine.
- Great.

15:00.030 --> 15:02.502
Ow! What was that for?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.304
Happy Flag Day, sis.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.515
Any chance you could
move your hand over
a little bit?

15:15.515 --> 15:16.987
Oh, yeah, and right
after that,

15:16.987 --> 15:20.450
I'll just plummet
to my death!

15:20.450 --> 15:23.123
You can fly.
Why aren't you saving us?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.924
I keep messing up.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.427
What if I do it again
and one of us dies?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.359
Well, if you're talking
about me,

15:29.359 --> 15:32.932
that would be a tragedy
of epic worldwide proportion.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.065
What about me?

15:35.065 --> 15:37.437
If this was about you,

15:37.437 --> 15:40.240
we would be hanging onto
a giant bust of your head.

15:42.472 --> 15:46.476
Why isn't Oliver
saving him?

15:46.476 --> 15:48.218
I better fly down
and get 'em.

15:48.218 --> 15:49.879
No, don't.

15:49.879 --> 15:53.223
Ah, you inherit
the old man's

15:53.223 --> 15:54.985
building and bank account
if he splats?

15:54.985 --> 15:57.057
Say no more.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.059
No.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.062
Oliver needs to save
Mr. Davenport himself.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.094
The reason he's having
trouble with his powers

16:04.094 --> 16:05.996
is because he's insecure.

16:05.996 --> 16:08.038
You're outshining him,
and it's getting into his head.

16:08.038 --> 16:10.700
Wait, okay, so he's
intimidated

16:10.700 --> 16:12.702
because I'm
so good at it?

16:12.702 --> 16:14.344
Yes.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.206
Oh.

16:16.206 --> 16:18.078
You know, I hate to say it,

16:18.078 --> 16:19.579
but I may need another
super power

16:19.579 --> 16:22.082
just to rein in
all this awesome.

16:24.114 --> 16:25.585
The more you succeed,

16:25.585 --> 16:27.087
the more it shines
a light on the fact

16:27.087 --> 16:28.818
that Oliver is struggling.

16:28.818 --> 16:30.590
The only way for him
to get over that

16:30.590 --> 16:32.322
is to make him feel
like he can do it.

16:32.322 --> 16:34.424
So we're gonna let him
save Mr. Davenport.

16:34.424 --> 16:35.825
Well, all righty then.

16:35.825 --> 16:37.727
Let's go make some popcorn

16:37.727 --> 16:39.899
and see how this train wreck
turns out.

16:45.975 --> 16:48.208
- OLIVER: Oh, great.
- What?

16:48.208 --> 16:50.810
I'm starting
to get chilly.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.482
Okay, it's official.

16:52.482 --> 16:55.845
You are the worst
superhero ever.

16:55.845 --> 16:57.617
( cracking sound )

17:01.391 --> 17:03.353
Your face is cracking.

17:03.353 --> 17:06.025
Forehead or cheekbones?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.958
Not you, the Daven head.

17:08.958 --> 17:11.701
Our weight is pulling it
off the base.

17:11.701 --> 17:13.863
No, your weight is
pulling it off the base.

17:13.863 --> 17:15.905
I was doing fine
till you got here.

17:15.905 --> 17:18.268
Would you do something?!

17:18.268 --> 17:20.440
Okay, uh...

17:20.440 --> 17:23.073
I know exactly
what to do.

17:23.073 --> 17:26.676
Kaz, help!

17:28.948 --> 17:30.780
I'm sorry, buddy.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.453
There's no way I can
carry both of you.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.256
Nice. That excuse sounds
pretty believable.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.288
Actually, it's the truth.

17:38.288 --> 17:40.490
I just realized,
Oliver's the only one

17:40.490 --> 17:42.232
with super strength.

17:42.232 --> 17:43.833
I couldn't save 'em
if I wanted to.

17:45.295 --> 17:47.967
Wait. So
Mr. Davenport's life

17:47.967 --> 17:49.699
is really in
Oliver's hands?

17:49.699 --> 17:54.544
Yeah, his wet, slippery,
ice cube-y hands.

18:00.950 --> 18:02.752
What are we gonna do?

18:02.752 --> 18:05.755
I'm sure Chase will
come up with something.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.317
And what if he doesn't?

18:07.317 --> 18:10.690
Then I guess we're
gonna die!

18:10.690 --> 18:12.091
( cracking )

18:13.793 --> 18:16.226
I'm too young to die.

18:17.627 --> 18:19.729
I'm too young to die.

18:19.729 --> 18:21.531
You're just about
the right age.

18:23.573 --> 18:25.104
( cracking )

18:25.104 --> 18:26.976
We're running
out of time.

18:26.976 --> 18:29.309
Oliver, you have to
do something.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.341
You're the only one
who can save us.

18:31.341 --> 18:33.913
You're right.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.488
And fly!!

18:38.488 --> 18:39.689
Oliver.

18:39.689 --> 18:41.421
( screaming )

18:50.930 --> 18:52.732
OLIVER:
I'm flying!

19:03.873 --> 19:06.045
Hey, I did it.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.378
I'm a hero!

19:09.379 --> 19:11.381
Yeah, but, uh,

19:11.381 --> 19:15.655
next time you save a guy,
pick a better hand hold.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.827
Sorry. It was tough
to get a grip

19:17.827 --> 19:20.660
with all your
shifting shapes.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.033
I can't believe
he came through.

19:24.033 --> 19:26.095
Hey!

19:26.095 --> 19:28.137
Oh, sorry. I mean, uh,

19:28.137 --> 19:31.341
Yeah, I can't believe
you came through.

19:32.642 --> 19:34.344
Just out of curiosity,

19:34.344 --> 19:35.745
what was your back-up plan

19:35.745 --> 19:37.307
in case Oliver here
didn't save me?

19:37.307 --> 19:39.909
Preserve your real
Daven head

19:39.909 --> 19:41.711
in the name of science.

19:41.711 --> 19:44.384
I was...
I was gonna get a spatula,

19:44.384 --> 19:46.656
and meet you
down at the sidewalk.

19:46.656 --> 19:48.388
( forced laughter )

19:48.388 --> 19:50.760
Hilarious! I'm leaving
everything to Bree.

19:55.665 --> 19:57.597
I'm proud of you, Oliver.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.530
Thanks. Oh, and by the way,
you were right.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.232
Once I stopped worrying
about Kaz

20:02.232 --> 20:03.733
and started believing
in myself,

20:03.733 --> 20:05.705
everything came together.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.338
Hey, you really stepped up
when it mattered,

20:08.338 --> 20:11.681
and that's part of being
a hero no one can teach.

20:11.681 --> 20:14.314
Well, except me.

20:15.985 --> 20:18.147
Congrats, bud.

20:18.147 --> 20:20.520
I guess we're both
good at this superhero thing.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.152
Yeah.

20:23.152 --> 20:25.995
Were you eating popcorn

20:25.995 --> 20:28.328
while I was hanging off
the edge of the building?

20:29.529 --> 20:31.331
Ah, yeah.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.003
Did you at least
save some for me?

20:34.003 --> 20:35.835
Uh, no. I thought
you were gonna fall.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.316
Hey, Mr. Davenport.

20:46.316 --> 20:47.877
Oh, hey, guys.

20:47.877 --> 20:50.650
Ew!

20:51.821 --> 20:53.883
Okay, I'm from
another planet,

20:53.883 --> 20:56.125
and I've never seen
anything that weird.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.330
I'm gonna Daven puke.

21:00.330 --> 21:02.191
All right.

21:02.191 --> 21:05.795
And to think we could've
just let him fall.

21:05.795 --> 21:07.737
Ha ha!

21:07.737 --> 21:09.899
What's going on?

21:09.899 --> 21:11.801
He's making
a mold of my face

21:11.801 --> 21:13.943
to replace
the broken Daven head.

21:13.943 --> 21:16.075
But if they're only
doing your head,

21:16.075 --> 21:17.747
why are you wearing
that outfit?

21:17.747 --> 21:20.610
Because I look
great in it.

21:20.610 --> 21:25.154
Do we have any super powers
that can make me unsee this?
