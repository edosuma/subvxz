WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:03.291
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:03.420 --> 00:05.806
for the murders
of 14 young women.

00:05.950 --> 00:07.341
We need you in Virginia, Ryan.

00:07.471 --> 00:08.685
I'm not an agent anymore.

00:08.794 --> 00:11.160
You caught Carroll.
No one knows him like you do.

00:11.274 --> 00:12.876
So what's my sequel about, Joe?

00:12.991 --> 00:14.969
We're gonna
write this together, Ryan...

00:15.072 --> 00:16.268
Aah!

00:16.717 --> 00:19.265
Even though you
slept with my wife.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.762
I have so many surprises
waiting for you.

00:23.511 --> 00:25.198
Cults, my specialty.

00:25.296 --> 00:27.483
Gay neighbors, the nanny,

00:27.577 --> 00:29.802
how do they figure
into your new plot?

00:29.976 --> 00:31.591
Why is my dad such a bad man?

00:31.708 --> 00:33.656
Maybe he's not so bad.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.630
And where are you going, huh?

00:38.739 --> 00:39.894
You're a liar.

00:41.366 --> 00:42.608
What the hell?

00:42.724 --> 00:44.293
Hey, guys.
This is Megan.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.871
I've never killed
anything before.

00:45.993 --> 00:47.500
We're just getting started.

00:47.586 --> 00:48.860
They're teaching him.

00:49.714 --> 00:51.638
Why did your husband
try to kill you?

00:52.086 --> 00:57.024
Rick can be scary
when he wants to be.

00:57.128 --> 00:58.223
So who has Joey?

00:58.350 --> 00:59.320
I don't know where the kid is.

00:59.429 --> 01:00.437
Does Rick know where Joey is?

01:00.543 --> 01:02.199
I don't know,
but his wife does.

01:02.338 --> 01:03.601
- What?
- Maggie.

01:03.709 --> 01:05.470
Maggie Kester is one of them.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.050 --> 01:16.526
How you doing?

01:17.510 --> 01:18.698
You sleep well all right?

01:18.827 --> 01:20.221
What are we gonna do, Paul?

01:20.335 --> 01:23.282
You really screwed up here.

01:23.373 --> 01:25.814
I think we've all
mad mistakes, Jacob.

01:26.258 --> 01:28.301
Mistakes are important.
It's how we learn.

01:28.406 --> 01:30.789
But you have gone
off the deep end.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.057
That is an understatement.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.760
Megan, you remember Emma.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.972
Look. She's not
very friendly.

01:38.062 --> 01:39.854
Just don't take it personally.

01:40.082 --> 01:41.549
I thought you were
gonna deal with this.

01:41.673 --> 01:43.453
That's funny.
When has he ever dealt with anything?

01:43.553 --> 01:44.940
Will you stop it?

01:47.242 --> 01:49.654
Who is she?
Where did she come from?

01:49.773 --> 01:52.663
We met in a little grocery
store one town over.

01:52.776 --> 01:55.021
You fool.
This is going to get us caught.

01:55.148 --> 01:56.643
Girls go missing all the time.

01:56.752 --> 01:58.463
Was there a surveillance
camera in the store?

01:58.574 --> 02:00.672
No. You didn't
think about that.

02:00.841 --> 02:02.163
You will be identified.

02:02.264 --> 02:03.171
It's a matter of time.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.659
We're wanted
in 50 states, Emma.

02:04.755 --> 02:07.246
Who cares?
They won't find this farm.

02:07.357 --> 02:08.371
We're in the middle of nowhere.

02:08.491 --> 02:10.616
Emma's right.
This is not cool.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.955
Wow, Jacob.
Thanks for pointing out

02:13.052 --> 02:14.345
an uncool situation.

02:14.466 --> 02:15.473
That helps.

02:15.590 --> 02:17.026
Heh. Told you.

02:17.374 --> 02:19.287
First things first.
We can't have Joey see her,

02:19.394 --> 02:20.729
so get rid of her.

02:20.906 --> 02:22.003
Kill her and bury her out

02:22.101 --> 02:24.435
behind that stable or barn,
whatever the hell that is.

02:29.707 --> 02:31.534
Ah. Sounds like a plan.

02:33.813 --> 02:36.880
Jacob, you kill Megan,
and I'll make breakfast.

02:36.969 --> 02:38.031
I'm thinking pancakes.

02:38.133 --> 02:39.774
Megan, do you like pancakes?

02:39.884 --> 02:41.878
Sorry. You'll be dead.

02:42.254 --> 02:44.064
Denise, where are you?

02:44.171 --> 02:47.658
Damn it.
Just do it.

02:50.725 --> 02:52.067
What are you doing, Paul?

02:52.178 --> 02:53.960
No, Jacob.
What are you doing?

02:55.062 --> 02:57.849
And just how long do you think
you're gonna get away with it?

02:57.950 --> 03:01.432
Because I for one
am tired of all the lies.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.528
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

03:12.404 --> 03:15.048
Wow! Say bye-bye.

03:15.136 --> 03:17.187
They got hardwood, barn,

03:17.283 --> 03:19.407
fences-- farmhouse.

03:19.542 --> 03:20.727
Have you got it?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.011
I'm analyzing it now.

03:22.130 --> 03:23.479
Those are northern
red oak trees

03:23.580 --> 03:25.157
and tall fescues grass
in the yard.

03:25.272 --> 03:26.595
Put us on the East Coast.

03:26.705 --> 03:28.226
I'm trying to pull a number
from the telephone pole.

03:28.332 --> 03:30.111
What about the e-mail
the video was sent from?

03:30.248 --> 03:32.667
Uh, an open IP address
courtesy of North Korea.

03:32.790 --> 03:33.882
They're changing
the routing again.

03:33.978 --> 03:34.965
They're watching the news.

03:35.070 --> 03:36.829
They know we got Rick
and his cell phone.

03:38.022 --> 03:40.074
How are you doing?

03:42.791 --> 03:45.576
I'm good.
All good here.

03:45.696 --> 03:47.109
Keep me posted.

03:48.542 --> 03:50.939
This is-- it's helpful.

03:51.511 --> 03:52.639
You know, they made this video

03:52.802 --> 03:53.927
for shock value.

03:54.038 --> 03:55.001
Joe's playing with us.

03:55.114 --> 03:56.605
It's like a game to him.

03:56.716 --> 03:58.350
There's no concrete evidence
to support

03:58.465 --> 04:00.809
psychopathic behavior
is hereditary.

04:00.929 --> 04:02.468
You think I don't know that.

04:02.747 --> 04:04.330
I know my son's
not a psychopath,

04:04.427 --> 04:06.068
but you put heroin in
someone's arm long enough,

04:06.169 --> 04:07.472
they become a junkie.

04:07.585 --> 04:09.236
These people are killers.
Why can't you find him?

04:09.344 --> 04:10.154
We will. We are--

04:10.236 --> 04:11.861
That's what you keep saying.
That's what you keep saying,

04:12.010 --> 04:13.488
that's what everyone
keeps saying.

04:13.582 --> 04:15.758
You're the FBI.
If you can't find him, who can?

04:15.873 --> 04:17.211
Claire. Claire.

04:26.053 --> 04:27.351
How did Jordy kill himself?

04:27.704 --> 04:31.456
He choked. Pried the bandage
loose with his mouth

04:31.573 --> 04:32.835
and ate it.

04:33.579 --> 04:35.239
Are you certain that Maggie
knows where Joey is?

04:35.350 --> 04:37.283
He said Emma and Maggie were
behind setting up the house

04:37.416 --> 04:38.980
and she would know
where they have Joey.

04:45.821 --> 04:47.690
Okay. Oh! All right.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.336
Not that way, not that way.
Straight.

04:49.450 --> 04:50.316
I am going straight.

04:50.422 --> 04:52.352
No, no, no.
I know that it seems that way, but--

04:52.451 --> 04:57.195
You-- you don't
have to help me walk.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.687
I know how to walk.

05:03.283 --> 05:04.692
Well done.

05:07.269 --> 05:08.875
Oh, my God.

05:09.399 --> 05:11.283
What am I gonna do with you?

05:11.462 --> 05:13.648
I'm sorry.
I drank too much.

05:15.905 --> 05:17.984
You gonna take that?

05:18.095 --> 05:21.427
No. I want to talk
to Joe about Maggie.

05:31.288 --> 05:32.646
Ryan.

05:32.751 --> 05:34.087
Hello, Joe.

05:34.161 --> 05:35.459
How can I help you today?

05:35.564 --> 05:36.892
I'm having a problem.

05:37.177 --> 05:39.663
I just can't see
the brilliance in all this.

05:39.762 --> 05:41.660
I mean, if you're writing a
book, where's the smarts?

05:41.757 --> 05:44.033
Because so far, it just all
seems like amateur hour.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.717
You found these
3 unstable freaks.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.819
You got Emma, Jacob, Paul,

05:48.928 --> 05:52.518
and you convince them
that to kill is to love

05:52.640 --> 05:55.521
or live or whatever the hell
it is you're preaching.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.060
You get them to kidnap
your own son,

05:57.174 --> 06:01.282
but it just seems beneath you
to go after such easy targets.

06:02.357 --> 06:04.250
I don't follow.

06:04.357 --> 06:06.020
Well, they're
obviously screwed up.

06:06.262 --> 06:08.982
Rick Kester's running around
wearing a Poe mask.

06:09.095 --> 06:10.983
It just all seems so silly.

06:11.097 --> 06:12.721
Yeah. I'll give you
that one.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.542
I was never a big
fan of that idea,

06:14.681 --> 06:19.126
but I do appreciate
his wife Maggie.

06:19.209 --> 06:20.134
Maggie?

06:20.315 --> 06:22.542
I find her most interesting,

06:22.652 --> 06:24.830
and they are so in love,

06:25.061 --> 06:28.308
and as you well know, I'm
partial to a good love story.

06:28.455 --> 06:31.466
Well, that love story's
come to an end.

06:33.807 --> 06:35.300
Are they dead?

06:35.424 --> 06:38.036
Uh, Rick is. Yeah.
I killed him myself.

06:39.473 --> 06:43.666
Oh, I...
I'm delighted to hear that.

06:43.762 --> 06:44.997
You're getting your mojo back.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.086
That's-- that's
wonderful news.

06:47.541 --> 06:51.526
I don't suppose Maggie was
too pleased to hear that.

06:51.981 --> 06:53.408
Why's that?

06:56.086 --> 06:58.650
Oh. This is
about Maggie.

06:58.761 --> 06:59.993
You're on a fishing expedition.

07:00.102 --> 07:02.304
Why didn't you say so?
We could have cut to the chase.

07:02.577 --> 07:04.720
Yes. Maggie--
Maggie is...

07:04.902 --> 07:08.601
Oh. She is
a very special girl.

07:08.715 --> 07:10.071
How so?

07:10.540 --> 07:13.875
Her real name is
Margaret Schuller--

07:13.993 --> 07:17.402
that's S-C-H-U-L-L-E-R.

07:17.528 --> 07:18.509
Go get on that.

07:18.628 --> 07:21.460
She first
visited me 8 years ago.

07:21.572 --> 07:23.750
She'd written to me
once or twice,

07:23.873 --> 07:26.268
and it turned out she'd been on

07:26.383 --> 07:29.925
this extraordinary killing
spree in Arkansas

07:30.032 --> 07:32.102
and completely
got away with it.

07:32.545 --> 07:38.752
No. I find Maggie to be extremely
resourceful, tenacious, and...

07:39.400 --> 07:40.831
impressive.

07:44.053 --> 07:46.595
'02 to '05
in Little Rock, Arkansas,

07:46.722 --> 07:48.707
there were 6 murders,
still unsolved,

07:48.823 --> 07:50.505
attributed to a female
serial killer.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.809
I remember this case.
Victims were stabbed.

07:52.918 --> 07:54.266
Little Rock Homicide
sent a witness sketch

07:54.392 --> 07:55.827
it's on my screen.

07:55.950 --> 07:57.938
They are not aware
of Margaret Schuller.

07:58.066 --> 07:59.149
If she visited Carroll
in prison,

07:59.271 --> 08:00.693
she used an alias.

08:04.060 --> 08:06.042
I need the phone.
Where is it?

08:11.699 --> 08:13.246
Did you see the news?

08:13.354 --> 08:14.762
There's an APB on Maggie.

08:14.887 --> 08:16.160
They can't find her.

08:17.354 --> 08:18.830
I'm not here.
Leave a message.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.071
She's not picking up.

08:20.164 --> 08:22.383
Maggie, where are you?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.476
Call me. I'm worried.

08:24.561 --> 08:26.251
You know the secure line.
Call it.

08:28.564 --> 08:30.392
Something's wrong.
She should have called.

08:30.497 --> 08:31.746
Maybe she can't.

08:31.828 --> 08:33.214
That's what I'm worried about.

08:33.892 --> 08:35.836
Well, sounds like
Rick screwed up.

08:39.909 --> 08:41.513
Joey.

08:42.524 --> 08:43.960
I'm coming!

08:49.486 --> 08:50.701
I'll be right out.

08:50.804 --> 08:52.146
Okay.

09:03.855 --> 09:05.582
What's happening
in the basement?

09:05.686 --> 09:07.862
Ask your boyfriend.
He's taking care of it.

09:07.967 --> 09:09.258
Well, if he can.

09:09.819 --> 09:11.636
What is that supposed to mean?

09:11.778 --> 09:13.807
Emma, I lived with
the guy for 3 years.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.723
That's a long time
to get to know someone.

09:15.835 --> 09:17.645
Is that about you two
getting your gay on?

09:17.889 --> 09:19.509
Look. I don't care how
much you fooled around.

09:20.165 --> 09:21.815
I'm not stupid.

09:22.063 --> 09:23.178
I know there's a reason
you were playing

09:23.285 --> 09:24.224
the jealous, little bitch,

09:24.349 --> 09:28.541
but whatever happened,
don't fool yourself.

09:28.848 --> 09:29.881
Jacob's not gay.

09:29.999 --> 09:31.303
Try again.
You're way off.

09:31.411 --> 09:33.323
This is about Jacob
and his lies.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.610
He's lied to you and me and Joe

09:35.860 --> 09:37.357
and everyone else.

09:37.950 --> 09:39.511
About what?

09:41.538 --> 09:46.187
Jacob's never killed
anyone... ever.

09:47.229 --> 09:49.397
You didn't know that, did you?

09:51.807 --> 09:54.550
God, I wish you could
see your face right now.

10:02.944 --> 10:04.177
This is from a hardware store

10:04.301 --> 10:06.310
off I-95 in
Trenton, New Jersey.

10:06.438 --> 10:08.366
Now they chat,
something's funny,

10:08.488 --> 10:10.436
they laugh, and then...

10:13.898 --> 10:15.239
What did she buy
at the hardware store?

10:15.359 --> 10:17.115
Cash purchase, cord rope, tape,

10:17.238 --> 10:18.646
flashlight,
and several magnets,

10:18.765 --> 10:20.111
neo base magnets.

10:20.444 --> 10:22.641
Magnets?
That chick's weird.

10:22.762 --> 10:24.257
If Joey was upstate,

10:24.475 --> 10:26.581
then I-95 would be the
route that you would take.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.389
Well, forensics said
New York or Connecticut.

10:39.691 --> 10:41.780
You had a doctor's
appointment this morning.

10:41.890 --> 10:43.700
They called.
They said that you missed

10:43.807 --> 10:45.358
your last checkup, too.

10:47.687 --> 10:49.918
You're a drunk
with a heart problem.

10:50.455 --> 10:54.019
You have a pacemaker sewn into your
chest to keep you alive, Ryan.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.963
You don't have to
take care of me.

11:01.858 --> 11:04.073
I care about you, I do,

11:04.203 --> 11:06.928
but I am just being stupid now.

11:07.038 --> 11:09.135
I mean, you've gotten
a raw deal,

11:09.247 --> 11:11.408
but something has to give here.

11:12.904 --> 11:16.274
Nothing changes
if nothing changes.

11:18.499 --> 11:21.613
What is that, a slogan from
one of your little groups?

11:28.816 --> 11:30.995
You know what?
It hurts too much to be around you,

11:31.123 --> 11:32.753
so I'm done.

11:39.316 --> 11:41.330
Sorry. I got to
take this.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.846
Hello, Jenny.

11:49.963 --> 11:51.402
Uh, Ryan.

11:52.048 --> 11:53.347
What's up?
Everything okay?

11:53.463 --> 11:56.066
No. No, it's not.

11:57.638 --> 11:59.901
Hello, Ryan.
It's Maggie Kester.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.154
Remember me, the wife
of the man you killed?

12:04.873 --> 12:07.501
Maggie, where are you?

12:08.122 --> 12:09.441
What are you doing with Jenny?

12:09.547 --> 12:10.629
We're bonding.

12:10.732 --> 12:11.848
Since you've been too busy

12:12.144 --> 12:13.693
to pick up the phone,
I won't keep you.

12:13.804 --> 12:14.932
I just have one question.

12:15.028 --> 12:17.182
How do you want me
to kill your sister?

12:21.518 --> 12:23.140
What do you want?

12:23.511 --> 12:25.012
I want you.

12:25.261 --> 12:27.416
I'll trade you
for your sister's life,

12:27.540 --> 12:29.919
but you come alone, unarmed.

12:30.051 --> 12:33.295
If you bring any FBI near here,

12:33.437 --> 12:34.747
your sister dies.

12:34.877 --> 12:36.031
Does Joe know
what you're doing?

12:36.157 --> 12:37.391
I've gone off book, Ryan.

12:37.497 --> 12:39.957
That's what killing a
husband will do to a girl.

12:40.215 --> 12:41.637
Come alone.

12:42.547 --> 12:43.704
Where are you?

12:43.816 --> 12:46.687
Your sister promised to show
me how to make a good risotto.

12:46.787 --> 12:48.874
I'll save you some.
Hurry.

12:54.601 --> 12:56.165
You heard from Maggie?

12:56.798 --> 12:58.207
No.

13:00.183 --> 13:01.924
You getting worried?

13:02.044 --> 13:04.583
I'm more worried about the
girl in the basement.

13:05.643 --> 13:07.393
What are we gonna do about her?

13:12.975 --> 13:15.762
We can't let her go, and I don't
want Joey to know about her.

13:16.638 --> 13:18.312
Take care of it.

13:20.168 --> 13:24.579
Well-- I mean, I really
think Paul should do it.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.132
He's the one that
brought her here.

13:26.259 --> 13:28.303
I think you should
do it, Jacob...

13:29.676 --> 13:31.772
since you never have.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.996
And I dragged her body

13:38.110 --> 13:40.893
from the car down to the water.

13:41.002 --> 13:44.672
That was the first time that I
realized how heavy bodies are

13:44.802 --> 13:46.180
when they're dead.

13:47.073 --> 13:48.354
Floated her out to the water

13:48.495 --> 13:52.879
to just barely where--
where I could stand, and...

13:54.955 --> 13:58.408
I stood on her for a good hour.

14:00.820 --> 14:05.402
I wanted to make sure her body was
completely weighted with water.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.814
Then I drove home.

14:22.726 --> 14:24.757
Who's next?
Ha ha ha!

14:25.521 --> 14:29.257
You told that story about
the girl in high school.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.829
I'm sorry.

14:33.794 --> 14:35.088
I love you,

14:35.285 --> 14:38.653
and I was ashamed.

14:38.753 --> 14:42.749
I mean, I was the
only one who hadn't--

14:42.854 --> 14:44.885
Why be a part of this?

14:44.995 --> 14:46.975
Because I want to.

14:47.537 --> 14:50.399
I want to be a part of this.

14:52.334 --> 14:53.948
I tried.

14:59.089 --> 15:01.405
It's time to do more than try.

15:03.643 --> 15:05.044
Do it.

15:06.221 --> 15:07.317
What's wrong?

15:07.454 --> 15:09.863
It's personal.
Be back as soon as I can.

15:09.939 --> 15:11.316
You're lying.

15:11.776 --> 15:13.221
Tell me the truth.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.622
I have a personal matter

15:15.928 --> 15:17.214
that I need to attend to.

15:17.332 --> 15:18.860
I will be back.

15:20.410 --> 15:21.809
Uh, where's he going?

15:21.924 --> 15:23.896
I don't know.
Go find out.

15:24.235 --> 15:25.456
You put me in the role
of snitch before.

15:25.566 --> 15:26.858
I didn't like it.

15:27.503 --> 15:30.275
He just took a call,
and now he's out of here.

15:30.395 --> 15:31.310
Something's up.

15:31.428 --> 15:32.625
Well, who called him?

15:32.725 --> 15:34.469
Someone named Jenny.

15:41.305 --> 15:42.873
Where you going so fast?

15:43.165 --> 15:44.477
Parker tell you to follow me?

15:44.558 --> 15:46.239
Yeah, and I got to say
I'm starting to feel used.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.819
She thinks we bonded, but we
both know you don't bond.

15:48.992 --> 15:50.583
So you going to Brooklyn?

15:51.848 --> 15:53.457
Why would I be
going to Brooklyn?

15:54.520 --> 15:56.341
That's where your sister lives.

15:56.959 --> 15:58.451
Jenny Orson, 38, divorced,

15:58.558 --> 16:00.537
runs a restaurant
in Williamsburg.

16:00.743 --> 16:02.006
Is that where Maggie is?

16:03.533 --> 16:05.413
Does Parker know
where I'm going?

16:05.600 --> 16:07.375
Did Maggie threaten
your sister?

16:12.546 --> 16:14.019
Maggie has Jenny.

16:14.133 --> 16:15.720
She wants revenge
for her husband.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.801
Everything Joe told us
checks out.

16:17.966 --> 16:19.051
She's a wanted serial killer.

16:19.162 --> 16:20.093
You can't go on your own.

16:20.206 --> 16:21.327
It's my sister.

16:21.450 --> 16:23.010
So let me go with you.

16:23.326 --> 16:24.868
Please.

16:25.566 --> 16:26.861
I didn't tell Parker
about Jenny.

16:26.961 --> 16:28.480
She doesn't know anything.

16:31.014 --> 16:32.369
You'll be fired.

16:32.503 --> 16:33.874
Actually, I think
I'm traumatized

16:33.993 --> 16:35.195
from the loss
of a fellow agent.

16:35.288 --> 16:36.925
I'm not thinking clearly.

16:37.111 --> 16:38.573
Probably get off
with a warning.

16:44.199 --> 16:45.250
Okay.

16:57.490 --> 16:59.346
My name is Mike, sir.

16:59.739 --> 17:00.982
You keep calling me Weston.

17:01.091 --> 17:03.279
That's my last name.
My first name is Mike.

17:07.528 --> 17:11.127
So your sister Jenny--
you two close?

17:12.661 --> 17:14.479
It's complicated.

17:15.136 --> 17:17.671
Copy that.
I got 3 brothers.

17:17.962 --> 17:20.546
Close with one,
hate the other two.

17:23.404 --> 17:24.615
No?

17:24.857 --> 17:27.246
Nothing?
No conversation at all?

17:29.887 --> 17:32.100
It's a long way to Brooklyn,
that's all.

17:34.526 --> 17:35.644
I'm glad you came.

17:35.765 --> 17:37.108
And surprised.

17:37.229 --> 17:38.918
Yeah, I am surprised.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.309
Me, too.

17:40.877 --> 17:42.960
- But I'm more glad.
- Me too.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.507
♪ spent a lifetime ♪

17:46.394 --> 17:50.638
♪ feeling incomplete... ♪

17:51.691 --> 17:53.599
Then they get mad.

17:53.839 --> 17:55.270
No.

17:56.556 --> 17:57.508
There she is.

17:57.616 --> 17:59.048
Hey. I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.576
- Hi.
- How you doing? Hi.

18:00.692 --> 18:02.144
Claire, this is Jenny,
my sister.

18:02.242 --> 18:03.266
Jenny, Claire.

18:03.359 --> 18:04.187
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:04.296 --> 18:05.066
It's nice to meet you.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.522
Nice to meet you.
I love your restaurant.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.974
Oh, it's yours.
Take it.

18:08.074 --> 18:09.269
Take the mortgage, take it all.

18:09.376 --> 18:10.509
Oh.

18:12.295 --> 18:13.308
So do we get
menus or--

18:13.408 --> 18:15.217
No, no, no, no.
This is a special occasion,

18:15.334 --> 18:16.900
so I have
a whole menu prepared.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.430
Um, I hope you like salmon.
Say yes.

18:20.169 --> 18:21.316
I love salmon.

18:22.094 --> 18:23.360
She's winning me over.

18:32.202 --> 18:33.788
It's Parker.

19:02.178 --> 19:03.484
So what's the plan?

19:03.598 --> 19:05.751
My sister's restaurant
is a few blocks up.

19:05.929 --> 19:06.974
It's closed.

19:07.090 --> 19:08.421
I'm gonna do
whatever Maggie says.

19:08.526 --> 19:10.222
The moment I know
my sister is safe,

19:10.331 --> 19:11.812
I don't care after that.

19:12.357 --> 19:13.989
I think you need a better plan.
Take my gun.

19:14.090 --> 19:15.758
No. She said
to come unarmed.

19:15.849 --> 19:17.088
Are you a good shot?

19:17.235 --> 19:18.256
I'm an overachiever, sir.

19:18.349 --> 19:20.439
All right.
There's a kitchen door, side alley.

19:20.540 --> 19:21.607
I'm gonna leave it unlocked.

19:21.708 --> 19:24.075
Something happens,
you don't worry about me.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.030
You make it all about Jenny.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.245
You understand?

19:28.232 --> 19:29.567
Yeah.

20:48.277 --> 20:50.167
_

21:41.068 --> 21:42.681
Hello, Ryan.

21:43.238 --> 21:46.002
I'm here, Maggie.
Where's my sister?

21:46.120 --> 21:47.285
She's here.

21:47.388 --> 21:49.364
Don't do that, or she dies.

21:49.468 --> 21:50.677
Okay, okay.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.255
You got me.

21:52.508 --> 21:55.430
Just let her go.

21:55.658 --> 21:57.416
I intend to.

21:57.579 --> 21:59.816
I've grown fond of your sister.

21:59.924 --> 22:02.055
She loves you very much,

22:02.162 --> 22:03.560
and I've enjoyed
getting to know

22:03.692 --> 22:06.857
all about Ryan Hardy,
the early years.

22:06.975 --> 22:10.983
It's a very sad story.

22:11.095 --> 22:12.701
Where is she?

22:12.823 --> 22:14.220
Jenny?

22:15.693 --> 22:17.131
Jenny!

22:17.859 --> 22:19.014
Jenny!

22:19.127 --> 22:20.271
Ryan!

22:25.482 --> 22:28.659
Don't scream, okay?

22:36.035 --> 22:37.396
Thank you.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.674
Thank you.

22:54.150 --> 22:56.820
- Jacob, right?
- No talking.

22:57.332 --> 22:58.997
I'll be quiet.

23:01.842 --> 23:04.114
I just want to say one thing.

23:05.653 --> 23:09.771
If you let me go, I won't
say anything to anyone.

23:09.886 --> 23:11.418
Of course you won't.

23:11.521 --> 23:13.727
I know you don't
want to hurt me.

23:16.273 --> 23:18.670
Look. I have an idea.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.889
You can cut me a little bit

23:22.239 --> 23:26.616
on my arms and my legs,
and I'll bleed a lot,

23:26.731 --> 23:28.307
all over the place,

23:28.433 --> 23:31.126
and then you can tell your
friends you killed me.

23:31.552 --> 23:34.500
Then you can say that you
took me out to the woods

23:34.620 --> 23:36.039
and dumped me in the ravine.

23:36.143 --> 23:37.222
They won't believe that.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.234
We'll make them believe it,

23:40.255 --> 23:42.438
and then I'll go home,

23:42.545 --> 23:46.330
and I won't tell anyone,
not a soul.

23:47.499 --> 23:49.480
Please.

23:51.578 --> 23:54.512
Let me go.

23:56.301 --> 23:59.004
I don't want to die.

24:05.588 --> 24:07.504
What's wrong, Jacob?

24:09.240 --> 24:11.336
I don't want to disappoint you.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.656
Hmm.

24:13.323 --> 24:15.025
I tried.

24:15.526 --> 24:22.007
I-- I can't do... it.

24:22.793 --> 24:24.571
Oh.

24:26.024 --> 24:27.955
Do the others know?

24:28.255 --> 24:29.676
I lied.

24:30.361 --> 24:32.543
I know that I shouldn't have.

24:32.634 --> 24:34.200
Jacob.

24:36.998 --> 24:39.388
Do you want to be part of us?

24:39.701 --> 24:41.387
Very much so.

24:41.502 --> 24:43.574
I don't want to go
back to my old life.

24:43.755 --> 24:45.444
I can't.

24:48.010 --> 24:52.342
"Deep into the darkness
peering,

24:52.871 --> 24:59.581
long I stood there,
wondering, fearing"...

24:59.688 --> 25:05.904
"Dreaming dreams no mortal
ever dared to dream before."

25:07.457 --> 25:09.043
It's okay.

25:09.941 --> 25:11.778
No one need know.

25:11.898 --> 25:13.762
It will be our secret.

25:13.882 --> 25:15.043
But I want to.

25:15.148 --> 25:16.802
I know,

25:17.005 --> 25:19.685
and one day, you will

25:20.637 --> 25:26.206
but when you
are ready. Hmm?

25:27.894 --> 25:29.896
Please!

26:02.940 --> 26:04.332
Shut up!

26:04.449 --> 26:06.729
Shut... up.

26:11.135 --> 26:13.556
Come on. Wake up.

26:14.808 --> 26:15.917
That's it.

26:16.581 --> 26:17.658
Easy. You don't
want to tip.

26:17.766 --> 26:19.190
That could hurt.

26:21.944 --> 26:24.958
Jenny. Did she
hurt you?

26:25.045 --> 26:27.103
No, I didn't.

26:27.643 --> 26:29.945
We were waiting for you,

26:30.092 --> 26:32.011
right, Jenny?

26:45.143 --> 26:46.525
Jenny.

26:47.535 --> 26:49.150
You're gonna be okay.

26:50.467 --> 26:53.691
I don't know about Jenny here.

26:54.106 --> 26:55.799
You promised me.

26:56.419 --> 26:58.422
I'm not gonna kill her...

26:59.955 --> 27:06.557
but the psychological damage
of watching her brother die

27:07.062 --> 27:09.308
is bound to leave a few scars.

27:09.476 --> 27:10.660
Just tell me what to do.

27:10.753 --> 27:12.257
Just please tell me what to do.

27:12.361 --> 27:15.012
Granted, it should be Claire who
witnesses your last breath,

27:15.126 --> 27:17.988
but, well, she's locked up
tighter than Joe Carroll.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.743
Yeah. Claire would have been
a more appropriate choice,

27:20.856 --> 27:24.017
but, oh, well.
Pain is pain.

27:30.276 --> 27:33.084
You know, I really enjoyed
meeting your sister today.

27:33.194 --> 27:35.221
Good. I'm glad.

27:35.328 --> 27:37.822
I feel like I got
a little more insight

27:37.932 --> 27:42.111
into the... mystery
that is Ryan Hardy.

27:42.222 --> 27:44.405
Not much, just a sliver.

27:44.536 --> 27:45.392
A sliver, huh?

27:45.496 --> 27:47.544
Yeah. Just a sliver.

27:51.363 --> 27:56.029
So I just gave you
a really good in

27:56.173 --> 27:58.537
to open up and talk to me,

27:58.667 --> 28:01.528
and you didn't take it.

28:07.715 --> 28:11.481
Come on, Ryan.
Just talk to me.

28:13.017 --> 28:14.845
It's kind of a downer.

28:14.968 --> 28:16.503
I don't care.

28:16.626 --> 28:22.996
Yeah. All right.
You asked for it.

28:23.179 --> 28:27.961
Uh, my mom got sick
when I was a kid, leukemia,

28:28.098 --> 28:32.544
and she fought it for
years, but it got her.

28:32.637 --> 28:34.233
She died when I was 14.

28:34.338 --> 28:35.286
Ryan, I--

28:35.385 --> 28:40.193
My dad, uh, was a street cop,

28:40.313 --> 28:43.943
Albany PD, his entire
life until he retired,

28:44.070 --> 28:49.027
and one night, he walked
into the wrong corner store

28:49.141 --> 28:52.088
at the wrong time and
tried to be a hero and--

28:52.200 --> 28:54.963
Ryan, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

28:56.909 --> 29:00.988
So it's just
you and Jenny then?

29:02.340 --> 29:07.161
We had
a older brother-- Ray.

29:08.516 --> 29:10.952
New York fireman.

29:11.427 --> 29:12.833
Oh, Go-- if you
say, "9/11"--

29:12.946 --> 29:14.816
Okay. I won't say it.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.568
Told you it was a downer.

29:24.943 --> 29:26.913
You and death go way back.

29:27.053 --> 29:27.633
Hmm.

29:27.737 --> 29:29.313
A lot further than Joe.

30:04.422 --> 30:05.724
Go!

30:06.038 --> 30:07.287
Get out of here.

30:08.926 --> 30:10.352
Go!

30:22.548 --> 30:24.020
Now to Virginia,

30:24.265 --> 30:27.334
where authorities are trying
to end a recent murder spree

30:27.483 --> 30:29.542
that looks to be the work
of a secret cult

30:29.669 --> 30:32.010
loyal to serial killer
Joe Carroll.

30:32.153 --> 30:33.586
Several people are dead,

30:33.696 --> 30:36.035
and Carroll's son
Joey Matthews...

30:41.936 --> 30:44.774
It's the girl!
She's getting away!

31:02.815 --> 31:04.288
You go that way.

31:04.389 --> 31:05.803
I'll go around the back.

31:37.818 --> 31:39.547
Paul!

32:01.672 --> 32:03.039
Unh!

32:06.065 --> 32:08.077
Relax. It's only
a flesh wound.

32:08.217 --> 32:09.319
Aah!

32:24.605 --> 32:29.595
One of my foster dads,

32:29.714 --> 32:31.516
he had a pacemaker

32:32.536 --> 32:34.555
just like yours.

32:34.770 --> 32:37.917
Oh. I read
your book.

32:38.670 --> 32:40.545
I know how bad off
your heart is.

32:40.658 --> 32:42.427
You really need it.

32:44.165 --> 32:48.379
Did you know
electromagnetic fields

32:48.488 --> 32:51.239
can interrupt the
function of a pacemaker?

32:51.360 --> 32:53.364
No! No! No!

32:53.481 --> 32:55.156
Shh!

32:55.551 --> 32:58.171
All you have to do is watch.
You have the easy part, Jenny,

32:58.690 --> 33:04.413
but your brother,
he is probably

33:05.150 --> 33:07.333
starting to feel...

33:07.438 --> 33:08.530
Maggie.

33:08.623 --> 33:11.276
A little woozy.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.706
Let her go.

33:15.154 --> 33:18.803
Please. Please don't--
please don't do that to Jenny.

33:19.984 --> 33:22.241
You can kill me,
but please let her go.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.066
Do you really think

33:24.204 --> 33:26.758
she's gonna walk out of here?

33:27.326 --> 33:29.186
There's too many knives
in this place for that.

33:29.287 --> 33:30.653
No. No, no, no, no.

33:30.775 --> 33:33.155
We're off book, remember?

33:33.525 --> 33:34.975
It's improv night.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.488
Joe doesn't want you
to kill me.

33:36.583 --> 33:38.339
That's the beauty of it.

33:38.939 --> 33:42.130
I'm not killing you.
Joe is.

33:42.232 --> 33:44.112
He's the one who stabbed
your heart.

33:44.223 --> 33:48.777
I'm just shutting down
your heart gizmo

33:48.879 --> 33:50.836
so that Joe actually
does kill you.

33:50.935 --> 33:53.577
I think it's perfect.

33:55.695 --> 33:57.941
Jenny, you watching?

33:59.567 --> 34:03.349
How cursed your family is?

34:07.928 --> 34:09.427
This...

34:10.364 --> 34:12.262
is for Rick.

34:12.678 --> 34:14.081
We loved each other.

34:14.190 --> 34:20.706
Do you even understand love,
Ryan, real love?

34:31.924 --> 34:35.034
Oh. Your fingers are blue.

34:35.143 --> 34:37.525
Your blood's not circulating.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.661
It hurts, doesn't it?

34:48.819 --> 34:51.300
No! No!

34:53.860 --> 34:56.962
No! No!

34:58.822 --> 35:00.644
It will be soon now.

35:03.586 --> 35:05.810
You don't want to miss the end.

35:07.925 --> 35:10.965
Let's get closer so you
can see his last breath.

35:16.645 --> 35:17.696
Stop!

35:28.548 --> 35:31.421
Okay. Hey! Hey.
Come on.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.869
You okay? Come on.
Wake up.

35:35.771 --> 35:38.076
All right. Okay.

35:46.148 --> 35:47.481
Sorry. I didn't
hear anyone.

35:47.590 --> 35:49.346
I was just
cleaning up. Ahem.

35:49.449 --> 35:50.808
Yeah. Same here.

35:52.274 --> 35:55.021
She really found

Once you remove
the interference,

37:37.261 --> 37:39.284
it diverts back
to its normal function.

37:39.409 --> 37:40.306
That's good to know.

37:40.411 --> 37:42.197
Make an appointment
with your cardiologist.

37:42.952 --> 37:43.966
You okay?

37:44.083 --> 37:45.544
Yeah. You?

37:46.688 --> 37:48.423
Maggie Kester's cell phone.

37:48.608 --> 37:50.502
It was on her.
I got calls, e-mails.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.330
I thought it was
on a secure server.

37:52.425 --> 37:53.571
Yeah, but if there's
a bump or delay

37:53.677 --> 37:56.348
on an incoming and an outgoing,
I can pull a location.

37:56.451 --> 37:57.425
Does Parker know?

37:57.509 --> 37:59.748
Oh, yeah. She still
chewed my ass out.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.301
I'll get suspended over this.

38:03.091 --> 38:05.240
We should go.
I got to get back.

38:05.361 --> 38:08.565
Yeah, Mike. Just...
give me one minute, okay?

38:08.665 --> 38:10.158
I'll be right with you.

38:16.316 --> 38:18.084
Do you think you could
disappear for a while?

38:18.193 --> 38:20.077
Because I think it would
be a good idea.

38:20.872 --> 38:24.783
Yeah. Uh, Miami's called
once or twice.

38:25.718 --> 38:28.457
Maybe a visit's in order.

38:28.644 --> 38:30.210
Okay.

38:33.453 --> 38:35.178
How's Claire?

38:36.725 --> 38:38.338
So what happened?

38:38.691 --> 38:40.325
Told her I needed time.

38:42.996 --> 38:45.337
We were never gonna work.
You said so yourself.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.345
Until I saw you guys.

38:47.444 --> 38:48.825
I mean, it's weird,
the situation,

38:48.934 --> 38:51.362
but I saw you guys.
I was wrong.

38:51.473 --> 38:53.228
You love her.

38:54.207 --> 38:56.379
I'm well aware of that, Jen.

38:58.524 --> 39:02.757
So... you break up with her
in some gesture of nobility?

39:02.887 --> 39:06.185
Claire and her son
need to move forward.

39:06.289 --> 39:09.910
As long as I'm there, I am always
going to be a part of Joe Carroll,

39:10.019 --> 39:11.185
and she needs a new start.

39:11.281 --> 39:12.221
She deserves that.

39:12.323 --> 39:13.890
What do you deserve?

39:18.547 --> 39:20.065
She's hanging in there.

39:22.795 --> 39:28.874
You know, that... woman
tonight was right about us, our family--

39:30.450 --> 39:35.449
cursed somehow,
surrounded by death and...

39:37.144 --> 39:40.024
I know that you're afraid
to let anyone get close to you.

39:40.141 --> 39:41.787
It's who we are,

39:43.584 --> 39:46.055
but we can't go
through life alone.

39:46.617 --> 39:48.462
It's no life.

39:50.752 --> 39:53.337
Emma?

39:54.998 --> 39:57.949
I'm sorry about...

40:04.772 --> 40:06.788
We're not giving up on you.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.417
When will you know?

40:29.513 --> 40:31.063
Let me know
as soon as you hear.

40:31.207 --> 40:32.543
Thanks.

40:39.993 --> 40:41.366
Hey.

40:42.359 --> 40:44.136
That woman I went after,

40:44.386 --> 40:45.479
we got her cell phone.

40:45.576 --> 40:47.375
They were able to find a
signal in upstate New York,

40:47.480 --> 40:49.251
Dutchess County.

40:52.035 --> 40:54.322
I'm glad your sister's okay.

40:55.339 --> 40:56.576
Thanks.

40:56.690 --> 40:58.843
Cyberteam thinks they're
gonna have an address,

40:58.950 --> 41:00.649
two hours at the most.

41:01.205 --> 41:03.057
This is a break, Claire.

41:03.435 --> 41:05.160
We're gonna find Joey.

41:06.620 --> 41:08.265
I know you will.

41:12.555 --> 41:13.934
I-- I should go.

41:14.049 --> 41:15.557
No. You-- you need to--
you need to rest.

41:15.730 --> 41:16.802
You need something to eat.

41:16.899 --> 41:19.556
I can-- I can
make you something.

41:22.804 --> 41:24.635
What do you deserve?

41:29.048 --> 41:30.495
I'm not ready.

41:30.610 --> 41:31.969
Life doesn't wait
for you to get ready.

41:32.070 --> 41:33.021
You got to jump in.

41:33.123 --> 41:34.956
Claire's not ready.
She's been through too much.

41:35.069 --> 41:36.306
She has a kid.

41:37.149 --> 41:39.154
I can make you breakfast.

41:39.250 --> 41:41.163
It's no trouble.
Just...

41:44.951 --> 41:47.874
Just-- just
until they call.

41:47.997 --> 41:49.359
We're not talking about Claire.

41:49.459 --> 41:52.830
I am no good for her
or for her son.

41:52.935 --> 41:56.205
I am a constant reminder of
the worst time in her life,

41:56.311 --> 41:58.050
and she doesn't deserve that.

41:58.498 --> 42:00.924
But you love her.

42:01.106 --> 42:03.181
Because I love her.

42:06.054 --> 42:09.694
Ryan, stay, please.

42:16.554 --> 42:18.660
I really need to get back.

42:20.588 --> 42:22.807
I'm gonna call you as
soon as I know anything.
