Cinémathèque française and the support

02:33.333 --> 02:35.624
Shall I tell you a secret, Severine?

02:37.750 --> 02:39.707
I love you more every day.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.457
So do I, Pierre.

02:41.625 --> 02:43.540
You're everything to me,

02:43.708 --> 02:45.915
but...
- But what?

02:46.833 --> 02:49.165
I, too, wish
it could be perfect.

02:50.250 --> 02:53.290
- If only you were less cold.
- Oh, please, Pierre!

02:54.375 --> 02:56.207
I didn't mean to annoy you...

02:56.791 --> 02:58.874
You know how fond I am of you.

02:59.041 --> 03:01.249
What good is it to me?

03:03.250 --> 03:05.707
How unkind you can be sometimes!

03:07.291 --> 03:08.332
I'm sorry.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.707
Stop!

03:26.250 --> 03:27.457
Get out!

03:27.625 --> 03:29.040
Why?

03:29.208 --> 03:30.540
Get out, I said!

03:30.708 --> 03:32.040
Why?

03:32.208 --> 03:34.457
- Come on.
- Leave me alone!

03:39.541 --> 03:41.832
Do as I said.

03:50.666 --> 03:52.415
How dare you?

03:52.875 --> 03:54.165
Let go of me!

03:56.208 --> 03:57.582
You brutes!

04:01.625 --> 04:03.124
It's not my fault.

04:03.291 --> 04:05.290
I'll explain!

04:07.041 --> 04:10.165
Don't be afraid to hurt
this little tart.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.040
- Hurry up!
- Pierre, it's your fault too.

04:13.208 --> 04:15.249
I can explain everything.

04:15.416 --> 04:18.665
Shut your mouth, Madame...
or I'll shut it for you.

04:26.708 --> 04:27.999
Stop it!

04:29.083 --> 04:31.332
Tell them to let me go!

04:37.166 --> 04:38.707
Help!

04:39.291 --> 04:40.832
Shut up, slut!

04:43.500 --> 04:44.665
Come on!

04:50.291 --> 04:51.582
Pull her up!

04:56.083 --> 04:58.290
If you scream, I'll kill you.

04:59.125 --> 05:01.249
Pierre, please...

05:01.416 --> 05:03.207
I'm sorry.

05:03.708 --> 05:05.499
Deeply sorry.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.832
I beg of you,
don't let the cats loose!

05:39.666 --> 05:41.082
That's enough.

05:41.625 --> 05:44.207
- She's all yours.
- I love you, Pierre.

05:54.916 --> 05:57.415
Severine,
what are you thinking about?

06:00.750 --> 06:02.415
Tell me...

06:04.708 --> 06:06.374
About you...

06:06.541 --> 06:08.207
about us.

06:08.375 --> 06:10.040
We were driving in a coach.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.124
That coach again?

06:20.541 --> 06:22.457
I want to kiss you.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.540
You have to get up early.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.540
- Why?
- To pack our bags.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.874
Where are we going?

06:34.041 --> 06:36.457
It's a surprise for our anniversary.

06:36.916 --> 06:39.540
We've been happily married
for a year now.

06:39.708 --> 06:42.749
- May the sun always shine on us!
- What about the hospital?

06:42.916 --> 06:45.207
I want to forget it
for a few days...

06:45.375 --> 06:47.082
and think only of you.

06:53.541 --> 06:55.332
- Happy?
- Yes...

06:55.500 --> 06:59.582
especially when you're here.
I want you with me every minute.

07:14.875 --> 07:16.665
No, please!

07:18.291 --> 07:19.790
Sleep well!

07:38.041 --> 07:39.874
Forgive me...

07:40.250 --> 07:42.665
You're so kind, so understanding.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.040
- But I...
- It's nothing.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.124
Go to sleep.

07:57.791 --> 07:59.874
Are you coming to the party?

08:00.041 --> 08:02.415
I don't know.
Husson turns in early.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.249
Let him sleep and come with us.
They said it'll snow later.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.332
I'd rather see the mesmerizer.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.082
- He does wonders.
- I wouldn't be put to sleep.

08:11.250 --> 08:14.874
Mesmerizers are not hypnotists.
They cause sunrises.

08:15.041 --> 08:18.374
A hypnotist plunges you
into darkness.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.790
Well, I'm off. See you later.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.707
What time is it?

08:35.291 --> 08:38.164
Five o'clock.
If you're bored, you can go.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.124
One is never bored in a bar.

08:40.291 --> 08:43.457
Not like in a church...
where you're alone with your soul.

08:44.875 --> 08:47.249
I'll tell you something pleasant.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.832
I love you.

08:51.458 --> 08:53.582
Your scars heal wonderfully!

08:53.750 --> 08:55.165
You bore me!

09:03.333 --> 09:06.415
- Let's not go. She's with Husson.
- Too late. He's seen us.

09:06.583 --> 09:09.290
What have you got against him?
He's interesting.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.915
Think so? I don't like his looks.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.457
Come on.

09:30.250 --> 09:31.707
I saw you passing,

09:31.875 --> 09:33.707
arm in arm.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.790
Just like newly-weds.

09:35.958 --> 09:37.332
Ridiculous, perhaps?

09:37.500 --> 09:40.915
Not at all. Reassuring
in an everyday sort of way.

09:41.875 --> 09:45.999
And yet, Pierre,
you sometimes make me feel guilty.

09:46.541 --> 09:48.457
We are so different.

09:48.625 --> 09:51.249
Men like you are rare.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.207
Sincerely.

09:55.416 --> 09:57.582
Oh... Thank you.

10:06.833 --> 10:09.707
What punishments I am missing!

10:09.875 --> 10:11.999
Why? Do you know them?

10:12.666 --> 10:14.124
Is that all you care for?

10:14.291 --> 10:16.874
All the rest's a waste of time.

10:17.041 --> 10:20.207
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

10:20.375 --> 10:23.832
Rich and idle,
his two main diseases.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.707
And hunting...

10:25.875 --> 10:29.290
Also, I'm particularly fond
of the working class.

10:29.458 --> 10:33.124
I think of them when it snows,
with no furs, no hope, no nothing.

10:33.291 --> 10:34.957
You're very attractive, Severine.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.374
Your compliments are too subtle.
Be quiet.

10:37.541 --> 10:38.999
Impossible!

10:39.166 --> 10:42.540
I'm leaving you now.
Got a headache.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.790
- Is it cold out?
- No.

10:44.958 --> 10:47.499
I'll get some fresh air.
See you later, Renée.

10:47.666 --> 10:49.749
- See you later.
- Enjoy your walk.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.582
I like him. He's amusing.

10:56.916 --> 10:58.415
He's strange.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.374
Worse than that...

11:21.583 --> 11:24.249
- I forgot to ask about Husson.
- He's well.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.290
- You still see him?
- Yes, unfortunately.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.374
Remember Henriette?

11:29.541 --> 11:30.957
Yes.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.082
They say...

11:34.250 --> 11:36.374
They say she works in a brothel...

11:37.458 --> 11:41.249
They say it's absolutely definite.
Several times a week.

11:42.416 --> 11:44.457
Henriette of all people!

11:45.583 --> 11:47.415
You're so innocent.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.499
Imagine.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.457
A woman like us.

11:53.291 --> 11:55.499
Going with anybody!

11:55.666 --> 11:58.332
In those places,
one has no choice.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.999
Young and old, ugly and handsome...

12:01.708 --> 12:03.540
Even with someone you love...

12:03.708 --> 12:05.499
it's not always pleasant.

12:05.666 --> 12:09.499
With strangers it must be horrible.
Do those places still exist?

12:10.333 --> 12:12.415
Excuse me, ladies...

12:12.833 --> 12:16.082
They exist, I can promise you that.

12:17.541 --> 12:19.832
But not like the pre-war days.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.624
No more red lights.

12:23.125 --> 12:26.374
Believe me, plenty of customers.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.582
I could show you half a dozen.

12:29.125 --> 12:31.165
It's part of my job.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.999
Been driving a cab for 20 years
and I've seen all sorts.

12:35.166 --> 12:39.207
I was even beaten up twice.
It didn't do me any harm.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.832
What's the matter with you?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.624
We're nearly there.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.457
These flowers came for you, Madame.

13:24.583 --> 13:27.082
- Who sent them?
- M. Husson.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.790
Why did you put them here?

13:47.875 --> 13:49.624
I'll go and get a cloth.

13:50.166 --> 13:52.790
It won't make a mark.
It was fresh water.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.665
What's the matter with me today?

14:24.375 --> 14:25.665
<i>Come here, Severine!</i>

14:31.625 --> 14:34.082
<i>Severine, are you coming or not?</i>

14:45.333 --> 14:46.874
Have you much more to do?

14:47.041 --> 14:48.915
Nearly finished.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.999
May I ask a silly question?

15:04.333 --> 15:06.082
Go right ahead.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.332
Before you met me...

15:11.500 --> 15:14.374
did you often go to...
"houses"?

15:15.250 --> 15:16.832
"Houses"?

15:18.875 --> 15:22.332
Not often. Why?
Are you interested?

15:22.500 --> 15:24.749
Everything about you interests me.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.457
I thought they'd been closed.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.665
They're undercover now.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.915
I can't imagine what it's like.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.665
Listen, I've got work to do.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.457
Please...

15:40.625 --> 15:42.957
Well, you go in.

15:43.125 --> 15:46.582
You choose a woman.
You spend half an hour with her.

15:47.500 --> 15:50.082
And you're depressed all day.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.165
That's how it is...

15:52.333 --> 15:55.582
- "Semen retentum venenum est."
- Stop it!

15:56.625 --> 15:58.707
I don't want to hear any more.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.999
What's the matter?

16:05.583 --> 16:08.790
I've never seen you like this.
What's wrong?

16:09.166 --> 16:11.499
I'm a little tired and on edge.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.790
Go and rest.

16:13.958 --> 16:15.457
Yes, you're right.

16:16.625 --> 16:17.790
Goodnight.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.540
- Shall I come with you?
- No!

16:21.708 --> 16:24.665
Yes, stay until I go to sleep.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.582
Won't you ever grow up?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.999
I can't hit a thing.
Take my place.

16:52.166 --> 16:55.082
- Are you going?
- I'll wait for you inside.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.874
- How are you?
- All right.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.165
- You don't come here much any more.
- No.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.749
See you later.

17:18.625 --> 17:21.040
The mysterious Henriette!

17:25.375 --> 17:27.540
The woman with two sides to her.

17:27.958 --> 17:30.707
A double life.
It's very interesting.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.665
Renée told you?

17:33.291 --> 17:34.457
But why?

17:34.625 --> 17:36.665
For money... that's all.

17:37.166 --> 17:40.790
Nearly all women who seek revenge
do it for money.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.707
I'm very glad to see you.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.540
I don't understand them.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.040
It's the oldest job
in the world.

17:51.208 --> 17:55.665
Nowadays it's done by phone.
Women who go to "houses" are rarer.

17:56.750 --> 17:57.999
You should know.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.915
Yes, I used to go often.

18:02.083 --> 18:05.540
I like the atmosphere.
Women completely enslaved.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.499
There was one near the Opera.

18:08.666 --> 18:11.207
But especially Madame Anaïs.

18:11.375 --> 18:14.915
11, Cité Jean de Saumur.
A very fond memory.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.165
Are you mad?

18:16.333 --> 18:20.082
It's nothing. "Cute compulsion"
as the English say.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.749
Insignificant impulses.

18:22.916 --> 18:26.707
One day, I want to be with you
without your husband.

18:27.250 --> 18:30.249
I like Pierre,
but I'd rather him not be there.

18:39.791 --> 18:43.124
<i>Madame Anaïs,</i>
<i>11, Cité Jean de Saumur.</i>

21:04.000 --> 21:05.957
<i>Madame Anaïs</i>
<i>Fashions</i>

21:29.916 --> 21:31.207
What's the matter?

22:08.541 --> 22:11.499
- What do you want?
- I'd like to speak to you.

22:17.833 --> 22:20.124
Is it you who...?

22:20.291 --> 22:22.124
I am Madame Anaïs.

22:22.291 --> 22:24.915
I'd like to find out if...

22:25.083 --> 22:27.540
Come. Let's have a talk.

22:33.958 --> 22:35.290
Sit down.

22:35.458 --> 22:38.082
- May I offer you a drink?
- No, thanks.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.707
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you. I don't smoke.

22:41.458 --> 22:44.207
Don't be afraid.
Make yourself at home.

22:44.750 --> 22:47.374
I think I can help you.
Sit down.

22:51.041 --> 22:52.999
You're charming and fresh.

22:53.166 --> 22:55.207
Just what they like...

22:55.375 --> 22:57.999
It's difficult at the start but...

22:58.166 --> 23:00.540
when somebody needs money...

23:02.875 --> 23:04.915
We go fifty-fifty.

23:05.958 --> 23:07.749
I have certain expenses.

23:07.916 --> 23:10.707
Thank you. But I must go.

23:11.875 --> 23:14.124
You're a little upset.

23:16.916 --> 23:19.332
It's the first time
you've worked?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.874
It's not that bad.

23:22.333 --> 23:25.332
The other girls aren't here yet.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.374
You'll lose your button...

23:28.458 --> 23:30.374
When can you begin?

23:30.541 --> 23:31.957
I'm not quite sure...

23:32.125 --> 23:33.457
This afternoon?

23:33.625 --> 23:36.332
Perhaps.
It would only be the afternoon.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.457
I must leave at five.
I really must.

23:40.375 --> 23:44.707
Two to five. That's fine.
But you must be punctual.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.957
I promise you
you'll be free at five.

23:49.875 --> 23:51.540
Goodbye. Excuse me.

23:51.708 --> 23:54.290
See you at two, then.

24:13.041 --> 24:14.957
Anything wrong?

24:15.875 --> 24:19.249
I was just out shopping
and I wanted to see you.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.415
But you don't like hospitals.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.207
No, I don't.

24:23.375 --> 24:26.415
I don't want to be alone.
I'll take you to lunch.

24:26.583 --> 24:29.999
I told you. I'm lunching
with the head surgeon.

24:30.166 --> 24:32.124
- I know but...
- I'm sorry.

24:33.166 --> 24:36.165
Don't forget our dinner
with the Fevrets this evening.

24:37.416 --> 24:39.832
- Sorry to bother you.
- Bother me?

24:40.000 --> 24:43.207
See you tonight. I'll be home
as soon as possible.

25:33.583 --> 25:35.499
I had given you up.

25:35.666 --> 25:38.415
You went off in such a hurry.

25:38.750 --> 25:41.499
I thought I had frightened you.
Come in.

25:45.708 --> 25:47.665
Put your things in here.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.832
You'll see the others in a moment.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.457
Mathilde and Charlotte.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.540
Both charming.

25:58.291 --> 26:01.207
I'll only have
well brought up girls.

26:01.375 --> 26:03.332
And above all, cheerful.

26:04.291 --> 26:06.832
I like them to enjoy their work.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.707
Last week, I had to let
a beautiful girl go.

26:11.875 --> 26:15.082
Much too vulgar... Pity.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.957
What's your name?

26:23.708 --> 26:24.582
I don't want...

26:24.750 --> 26:27.249
I'm not asking for your real name.

26:27.666 --> 26:30.540
You don't imagine my name is Anaïs!

26:31.250 --> 26:34.165
We'll have a drink to celebrate.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.624
Just a tiny one.
Cherries in brandy.

26:39.416 --> 26:43.249
We must find you a name.
Something simple and pretty.

26:43.833 --> 26:45.415
Easy to remember.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.040
Let's think of one.

26:52.750 --> 26:56.332
That's Monsieur Adolphe.
One of our best clients.

26:57.166 --> 26:59.374
You'll see, very amusing.

27:00.708 --> 27:04.332
I've an idea.
What if we call you "Belle de Jour"?

27:05.208 --> 27:07.082
Since you only come
in the afternoon.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.040
All right.

27:11.916 --> 27:13.790
Don't be so nervous.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.374
Relax.

27:16.541 --> 27:19.290
You'll leave at five,
don't worry.

27:20.666 --> 27:22.665
Will somebody be waiting?

27:23.583 --> 27:25.457
A boyfriend?

27:26.041 --> 27:27.415
A husband?

27:28.125 --> 27:30.540
Don't worry.
I'm not inquisitive.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.540
Give me a kiss.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.665
The ladies are thirsty.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.790
Wait for me here.

27:52.375 --> 27:55.082
A new one!
And you're hiding her!

27:55.708 --> 27:59.165
Bring her quick.
Or I'll get her myself.

28:13.291 --> 28:14.957
He's very funny.

28:15.125 --> 28:18.249
A candy manufacturer
from Bordeaux.

28:18.833 --> 28:21.165
He makes millions. Come on.

28:23.416 --> 28:27.290
If I don't get it every day,
I can't sleep.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.457
The other day,

28:29.625 --> 28:33.540
I had a coloured girl.
What a party!

28:37.541 --> 28:39.499
This is Belle de Jour.

28:42.166 --> 28:43.707
I told you about the curtains.

28:43.875 --> 28:48.374
My respects of a quarter to three.
Have a glass of champagne.

28:48.541 --> 28:51.082
Anaïs, a bottle,
and make it snappy!

28:51.250 --> 28:54.999
You're lucky.
When you're new, they open a bottle.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.165
You must have smelt the champagne!

29:00.000 --> 29:02.499
Get acquainted.
I'll be right back.

29:06.458 --> 29:09.707
What a woman!
Every bit of her's good!

29:09.875 --> 29:11.790
Forget it.
She's too respectable.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.749
That's just it.

29:13.916 --> 29:16.499
This man. Can't stop him!

29:16.666 --> 29:18.374
What a character!

29:18.958 --> 29:20.665
Pretty dress!

29:20.833 --> 29:24.332
But not convenient for a quick strip.
Right, Monsieur Adolphe?

29:24.500 --> 29:27.665
Oh, no, she's great in that dress.

29:27.833 --> 29:30.665
Very refined. I like that.

29:30.833 --> 29:34.082
You might give me one like that.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.582
My name's not Rothschild, honey.

29:36.750 --> 29:38.124
Shame!

29:39.500 --> 29:41.290
What a cut.

29:42.291 --> 29:44.124
Look at the detail.

29:44.291 --> 29:46.540
It's all a matter of money.

29:46.708 --> 29:48.874
You can't buy class.

29:49.041 --> 29:50.457
Here's the champagne.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.749
About time!
I was running dry!

29:58.375 --> 30:00.874
Leave it! That's a man's job.

30:01.041 --> 30:04.165
I'm the world's champion
cork-popper.

30:04.583 --> 30:06.207
What wrist action!

30:06.375 --> 30:09.624
<i>I like ham and eggs.</i>

30:09.791 --> 30:12.790
<i>But I love best...</i>

30:12.958 --> 30:16.749
<i>a pair of legs.</i>

30:19.250 --> 30:21.374
Of course, it's too warm.

30:21.541 --> 30:24.124
Warm champagne is like tea.

30:24.291 --> 30:27.665
Had I known
I'd have put it in the freezer.

30:27.833 --> 30:29.832
But you knew I was coming.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.790
I didn't know Belle de Jour was.

30:31.958 --> 30:35.290
To the most precious
health of all...

30:35.458 --> 30:37.999
- Mine!
- And to Belle de Jour!

30:40.958 --> 30:42.540
Okay, but a little warm.

30:43.583 --> 30:47.165
Mathilde, I've a present for you.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.957
- What is it?
- Have a look.

31:09.250 --> 31:11.957
He always comes up
with something new.

31:12.625 --> 31:13.999
Here's to fun!

31:14.166 --> 31:16.874
That's how I am. I like fun.

31:23.541 --> 31:25.582
Well, Belle de Jour...

31:26.166 --> 31:27.749
You're mad at us?

31:29.791 --> 31:31.457
What's the matter?

31:38.291 --> 31:39.499
You'll see...

31:40.750 --> 31:43.290
We'll have a good time together.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.957
What's eating her?

31:51.125 --> 31:52.832
I'll talk to her.

31:53.375 --> 31:55.374
Don't rush her.
It's the first time.

31:55.541 --> 31:58.582
- That's what you think.
- But it is.

32:04.041 --> 32:07.124
- Who does she think she is?
- She's new.

32:07.708 --> 32:10.582
You've made a hit already.

32:11.041 --> 32:13.999
Don't worry.
He's very easy-going.

32:14.875 --> 32:17.082
Do what he wants, that's all.

32:17.666 --> 32:19.374
- I want to go.
- What?

32:20.375 --> 32:22.790
How much longer are you going
to play this game?

32:22.958 --> 32:24.915
Who do you think you are?

32:26.791 --> 32:28.374
Very well, I'm going...

32:30.083 --> 32:31.665
Leave me alone with her.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.165
What you need is a firm hand.

32:47.875 --> 32:49.082
Hi!

32:50.041 --> 32:51.540
Close the door.

32:55.875 --> 32:57.749
I've sent the others away.

32:57.916 --> 32:59.957
It's more intimate.

33:00.708 --> 33:01.999
So...

33:02.708 --> 33:05.457
They say it's your first time.

33:07.583 --> 33:12.040
Careful now. Don't tell me any lies.
I can tell.

33:13.541 --> 33:14.832
But...

33:15.000 --> 33:16.540
if it's true...

33:16.708 --> 33:18.832
No need to be ashamed.

33:19.375 --> 33:23.124
Don't tell me
you're a virgin at your age...

33:25.166 --> 33:26.915
We'll soon find out.

33:27.708 --> 33:29.040
Well now...

33:29.708 --> 33:31.415
Do I frighten you?

33:31.833 --> 33:33.999
Is it my face you don't like?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.374
You'll have to get used to it.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.790
You won't get out of it like that.

33:44.958 --> 33:48.249
Who do you think you are,
little bitch!

33:48.416 --> 33:50.874
Leading me on,
and then stopping me.

33:51.458 --> 33:54.874
I've had enough of your playacting.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.332
That's better.

34:06.250 --> 34:09.748
So... it's rough stuff you need,
is it?

34:16.125 --> 34:19.040
Jack of Clubs is my gin card.

34:23.541 --> 34:25.665
Adolphe is taking his time.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.415
So he should!

36:05.625 --> 36:08.707
Where are you, Severine?
Are you ready?

36:11.250 --> 36:12.749
Oh, you're here.

36:12.916 --> 36:15.707
What's wrong?
Is something the matter?

36:17.041 --> 36:17.999
Are you ill?

36:23.625 --> 36:25.874
You don't have a temperature.

36:26.333 --> 36:30.540
- Should I send for someone?
- It's nothing. I was asleep.

36:31.250 --> 36:33.457
I had a headache.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.665
I took an aspirin and a bath.
I'll be all right.

36:36.833 --> 36:38.415
What time is it?

36:38.583 --> 36:42.415
Late. I'll phone
and tell the Fevrets not to wait.

36:42.583 --> 36:44.957
- Go without me.
- Certainly not.

36:45.125 --> 36:48.415
It's better if I stay
and I've some work to finish.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.415
Sleep well.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.665
How's the soup?

37:25.833 --> 37:28.624
It's cold and I can't warm it.

37:33.166 --> 37:35.249
Are bulls given names like cats?

37:35.416 --> 37:38.499
Yes. Most of them
are called Remorse

37:39.041 --> 37:42.040
except the last one.
He's called Expiation.

37:53.333 --> 37:54.540
What time is it?

37:54.708 --> 37:57.832
Between two and five.
But no later than five.

37:58.791 --> 38:01.290
- How's your wife?
- Very well, thank you.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.499
- Where is she?
- Just there.

38:03.666 --> 38:05.999
- Want to say hello?
- With pleasure.

38:06.166 --> 38:07.749
How are you, piece of trash?

38:07.916 --> 38:10.415
Feeling all right, slut?

38:10.958 --> 38:12.249
Scum!

38:12.416 --> 38:13.582
Swill!

38:13.916 --> 38:15.082
Rubbish!

38:15.250 --> 38:17.832
- Dung devourer!
- Sodomite!

38:18.000 --> 38:20.290
- Spermentress!
- Bitch!

38:21.500 --> 38:24.124
Pierre, stop! I love you.

38:28.166 --> 38:29.957
What do you want?

38:30.708 --> 38:32.290
I... I wanted...

38:32.458 --> 38:34.040
To come back?

38:34.583 --> 38:38.124
And then disappear again for a week
without a word...

38:38.291 --> 38:42.499
- Forgive me.
- There's the street for amateurs.

38:42.666 --> 38:44.332
Please...

38:46.125 --> 38:48.332
You're lucky to be dealing with me.

38:48.500 --> 38:51.582
Others would have
slammed the door on you.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.707
I'm too kind-hearted.

38:57.833 --> 39:01.040
If you come back, you must behave.

39:02.458 --> 39:04.457
Can I count on you every day?

39:04.625 --> 39:06.915
But only till five.

39:11.500 --> 39:14.124
I'm glad to see you back.

39:14.958 --> 39:17.790
- Belle de Jour, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

39:17.958 --> 39:20.790
- You ran out on us.
- Why didn't you come sooner?

39:20.958 --> 39:23.457
- I couldn't.
- Give me your coat.

39:24.250 --> 39:26.082
A cute coat!

39:26.250 --> 39:28.332
I've a favor to ask of you.

39:28.500 --> 39:32.082
Could you lend it to me for Sunday?
I'll give it back on Monday.

39:32.250 --> 39:36.915
Well... I'm sorry,
but Sunday is a little difficult.

39:37.458 --> 39:40.290
- Couldn't you...?
- It's OK. I saw it in ready-made.

39:40.458 --> 39:43.540
Carducci!
Some people do themselves proud!

39:44.500 --> 39:45.999
Who are you?

39:48.125 --> 39:50.082
Are you sad to be back?

39:50.708 --> 39:55.207
I come here because my fiancé
had an accident and can't work.

39:55.666 --> 39:58.624
He knows I come here.
But I love him.

39:59.333 --> 40:01.707
Of course I could get a job.

40:01.875 --> 40:04.124
- What would you earn?
- True.

40:05.291 --> 40:07.749
The professor will be here
any minute.

40:08.083 --> 40:10.165
You must meet him.

40:10.333 --> 40:13.207
- You're his type.
- Who is he?

40:13.625 --> 40:16.374
A famous gynaecologist.

40:16.541 --> 40:18.207
He has an international reputation.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.582
He's even operated in Copenhagen.

40:21.916 --> 40:24.874
There he is.
Explain things to her.

40:26.916 --> 40:28.707
It's dark already.

40:31.541 --> 40:35.207
You'll see, it's not difficult.
If only they were all like him!

40:36.916 --> 40:38.707
I have a new one.

40:38.875 --> 40:42.249
I think you'll like her.
A bit shy but...

40:42.416 --> 40:44.374
a real aristocrat.

40:45.625 --> 40:48.749
So much the better.
Send her to me.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.415
What are you doing?

42:13.708 --> 42:16.040
Didn't they tell you?
Get dressed.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.665
Her Ladyship sent for me?

42:40.666 --> 42:43.374
Is Her Ladyship
not satisfied with me?

42:43.541 --> 42:44.832
Well...

42:45.375 --> 42:46.624
no...

42:55.833 --> 42:57.874
You belong in the kitchen...

42:59.041 --> 43:01.290
She's useless. Send me Charlotte.

43:01.458 --> 43:02.749
Right away.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.040
You come with me.

43:12.666 --> 43:14.540
Charlotte, go to the professor.

43:14.708 --> 43:16.665
Just a sec.
I'll finish undressing.

43:16.833 --> 43:19.415
Get in! It's not that difficult!

43:31.291 --> 43:32.665
Stand here!

43:36.000 --> 43:38.207
Watch how Charlotte does it.

43:38.375 --> 43:40.124
And be very quiet.

44:01.916 --> 44:03.582
Her Ladyship sent for me?

44:04.625 --> 44:06.874
Is Her Ladyship
not satisfied with me?

44:07.041 --> 44:09.207
You make a mess of everything.

44:10.333 --> 44:13.040
It's true. I do.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.457
But Her Ladyship is so kind
and so forgiving.

44:17.625 --> 44:19.832
- And so beautiful.
- Impudent!

44:23.041 --> 44:24.374
Look!

44:24.916 --> 44:27.374
You must be blind.
Can't you see?

44:27.541 --> 44:31.790
There's dust everywhere...
There! And there!

44:35.291 --> 44:37.082
I broke a vase...

44:37.250 --> 44:39.124
A vase! That's it!

44:39.291 --> 44:40.665
This time you're fired.

44:40.833 --> 44:44.540
No! I implore Her Ladyship
to keep me.

44:44.958 --> 44:49.207
Keep me near her. I'll make up for it.
I'll be very careful, I swear.

44:49.958 --> 44:52.832
- Not yet, Charlotte. Give it here!
- Oh, sorry.

44:53.541 --> 44:55.749
I implore Her Ladyship
to punish me...

44:56.125 --> 44:57.749
To beat me.

44:57.916 --> 44:59.624
But not to send me away.

44:59.791 --> 45:01.332
What are you doing?
You're disgusting.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.665
I'm not doing anything.

45:03.833 --> 45:05.999
I don't dare... alas!

45:06.166 --> 45:07.749
I ought not to say it...

45:07.916 --> 45:09.790
It's a secret...

45:10.250 --> 45:12.207
- I love you...
- What?

45:15.000 --> 45:16.332
I love you.

45:17.875 --> 45:19.749
And now that I have told you...

45:20.333 --> 45:22.540
of my great love...

45:23.916 --> 45:25.707
Kick me

45:25.875 --> 45:27.582
and spit on me.
Walk over my face.

45:29.708 --> 45:33.124
You dirty old man.
You swine. I'll teach you...

45:43.708 --> 45:46.124
Come on. Somebody's waiting.

45:48.416 --> 45:50.124
Well, did you see?

45:50.291 --> 45:51.832
What do you think?

45:52.500 --> 45:54.582
How can anyone sink so low?

45:55.208 --> 45:57.832
I suppose you're used to it.
But I'm not.

46:05.333 --> 46:07.915
Not me, thank you.

46:12.416 --> 46:15.165
How about this one?

46:23.666 --> 46:25.082
What's this?

46:28.041 --> 46:31.457
That's no good here. Cash!

46:40.708 --> 46:42.249
Very good. Off you go.

47:30.833 --> 47:32.582
Don't be afraid.

48:13.666 --> 48:15.207
- Did you work hard?
- Yes, mom.

48:15.375 --> 48:16.832
Have you been good?

48:17.000 --> 48:20.124
Say good afternoon to auntie.
Show her your grades.

48:21.666 --> 48:23.165
Hello, Cathy.

48:25.041 --> 48:26.832
Show me your report card.

48:29.458 --> 48:31.040
Don't you say hello to me?

48:31.208 --> 48:32.915
Hello, Miss Mathilde.

48:34.583 --> 48:38.124
I'll take you to the fair on Sunday.
Would you like that?

48:39.750 --> 48:41.957
7 in history, 9 in recital.
Very good.

48:48.458 --> 48:50.749
The professor wants an inkpot.

48:51.541 --> 48:53.832
- What's going on?
- He wants an inkpot.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.915
An inkpot? I haven't got one.

49:22.333 --> 49:24.832
Go upstairs and do your homework.

49:53.666 --> 49:56.124
That man would frighten me too.

49:57.083 --> 49:59.749
It must be painful sometimes...

50:01.666 --> 50:03.832
How would you know, Pallas?

50:50.333 --> 50:51.874
May I, Miss?

50:52.041 --> 50:53.499
Of course you may.

50:56.916 --> 50:58.374
Miss or Missus?

50:59.750 --> 51:01.332
Fine.

51:02.750 --> 51:04.165
What is your name?

51:04.333 --> 51:05.999
Belle de Jour.

51:06.166 --> 51:07.749
Charming!

51:07.916 --> 51:11.249
I had a cat
called Beauty of Twilight.

51:13.208 --> 51:15.124
You come here often?

51:15.791 --> 51:17.665
Every day in my thoughts.

51:20.291 --> 51:22.415
A pleasant morning, isn't it?

51:22.583 --> 51:24.290
Yes, it is.

51:24.750 --> 51:27.874
I much enjoy the autumn sun.

51:28.333 --> 51:30.374
The black sun.

51:33.083 --> 51:35.415
You are very elegant.

51:37.291 --> 51:39.124
Do you like money?

51:40.458 --> 51:41.624
Yes.

51:42.041 --> 51:44.749
I'll give you a lot
if you come home with me.

51:44.916 --> 51:45.749
With you?

51:45.916 --> 51:49.374
Have no fear.
It's a sort of ceremony.

51:50.041 --> 51:53.499
A very moving religious ceremony
that means a lot to me.

51:53.833 --> 51:56.374
I am a man of another age...

51:56.541 --> 51:59.249
an age when there was
a feeling for death.

52:00.208 --> 52:03.874
You would make me very happy
if you'd come.

52:04.250 --> 52:06.915
You're just the girl
I'm looking for.

52:08.083 --> 52:09.915
I live an hour away from Paris.

52:10.666 --> 52:12.290
Here's my card.

52:13.208 --> 52:15.124
I will meet you at the station.

52:54.083 --> 52:56.624
Kindly put this on.

52:56.791 --> 52:58.499
What's it all about?

52:59.458 --> 53:02.165
Don't be alarmed.

53:02.958 --> 53:06.499
Those who preceded you
would like to come back.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.707
But the Duke is very strict
on this matter.

53:15.125 --> 53:16.999
Please walk this way.

53:21.958 --> 53:23.165
Through here.

53:37.916 --> 53:39.040
This way.

54:05.875 --> 54:08.165
I brought you lilies...

54:08.875 --> 54:10.582
that you loved so much.

54:11.583 --> 54:13.207
How beautiful you are!

54:14.416 --> 54:16.499
Your skin is whiter...

54:18.166 --> 54:20.624
and your hair softer.

54:33.166 --> 54:35.165
My beloved daughter.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.124
Your face is cold.

54:44.791 --> 54:47.832
Do you remember...
we used to play here together?

54:48.458 --> 54:50.915
How we laughed and sang!

54:53.083 --> 54:55.874
Now you just lie there

54:56.458 --> 54:58.124
and say nothing.

54:59.958 --> 55:02.124
I hope you have forgiven me.

55:02.625 --> 55:05.082
It's not my fault.
I loved you so much.

55:06.166 --> 55:08.957
Your Lordship,
shall I let the cats in?

55:09.125 --> 55:10.832
Go to hell with your cats!

55:15.958 --> 55:17.707
We are quite alone.

55:19.416 --> 55:21.290
The doors are all closed.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.540
Now...

55:30.375 --> 55:32.749
your eyes will never open again.

55:33.791 --> 55:35.832
Your limbs are stiff.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.832
Worms are eating your heart.

55:41.958 --> 55:45.415
And this sickly odor
of dead flowers.

56:21.750 --> 56:23.999
Still here?
What are you waiting for?

56:24.166 --> 56:25.957
But it's raining and...

56:26.333 --> 56:27.999
So what?

56:29.416 --> 56:31.582
Get the hell out of here!

56:31.750 --> 56:33.207
Go on, out!

56:57.416 --> 56:58.957
Are you almost finished?

56:59.125 --> 57:00.374
Coming.

57:13.708 --> 57:15.582
Shall I stay with you?

57:27.958 --> 57:30.290
I only wish you'd stay more often...

57:30.458 --> 57:32.124
of your own free will.

57:32.291 --> 57:34.957
I will, Pierre. Give me time.

57:35.125 --> 57:38.582
I always feel I'm imposing on you.

57:39.083 --> 57:40.832
Don't believe that.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.415
More and more
I want to be alone with you.

57:44.083 --> 57:46.040
You don't frighten me now.

57:46.208 --> 57:50.665
I feel that I understand you better,
that I'm getting closer to you.

57:51.833 --> 57:54.124
Every day I love you more.

58:06.916 --> 58:08.415
Is Madame at home?

58:09.625 --> 58:11.832
- Whom shall I say?
- Monsieur Husson.

58:15.541 --> 58:17.790
Monsieur Husson to see you,
Madame.

58:18.500 --> 58:20.290
Tell him I'm not at home.

58:28.541 --> 58:30.624
Good afternoon, Miss. Thank you.

58:44.083 --> 58:46.249
How seductive you are!

58:47.291 --> 58:49.540
I feel like writing a letter.

58:49.708 --> 58:51.415
I'd be delighted.

58:51.583 --> 58:53.290
But would you accept?

58:54.458 --> 58:55.999
There are too many people here.

58:56.166 --> 58:57.749
All the better!

58:57.916 --> 59:00.249
I must give you a receipt.

59:00.416 --> 59:01.915
I'm relying on it.

59:05.208 --> 59:06.790
With that?

59:14.833 --> 59:16.415
What are they doing?

59:17.666 --> 59:20.957
Nothing. Just fooling around.
Have a look.

59:21.125 --> 59:22.832
No. You tell me.

59:24.166 --> 59:26.457
- He's taking an envelope.
- And?

59:27.666 --> 59:29.915
No... it's a packet of lily seeds.

59:32.208 --> 59:34.082
Oh yes, I see.

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.790
- What floor?
- Fourth.

01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:37.040
What are you doing?

01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:39.999
Help!

01:00:43.666 --> 01:00:45.915
Don't do anything stupid.
You're crazy.

01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:48.374
Hurry up! Quickly!

01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:42.790
Well, Hippolyte!
How about that?

01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:45.540
Hello, Anaïs.
Can we come in?

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:47.874
Of course.

01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:55.415
Through there.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.874
- It's Hippolyte.
- From Murcia?

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.457
I'd hoped we were rid of him.

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:12.707
I don't know the other one.

01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:14.332
Who is Hippolyte?

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.415
Who knows? A strange kind of guy.

01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:20.124
He spends money like water.

01:02:20.291 --> 01:02:22.707
But when he's broke,
he gets it free.

01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:26.040
Come along, girls.
All three of you.

01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:36.790
How's the little one?

01:02:37.583 --> 01:02:39.415
Is she ready to be kissed?

01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:42.374
I don't know, Sir.
She has to finish school.

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:44.082
Great!

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:51.332
You won't complain.

01:02:55.416 --> 01:02:56.874
What does that mean?

01:02:58.166 --> 01:02:59.582
How are you?

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:02.040
- Okay, and you?
- We keep going.

01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:05.165
We haven't seen you for months.

01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:07.415
- We missed you a lot.
- Really?

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:10.040
- Where were you?
- On a trip.

01:03:10.541 --> 01:03:11.999
New York.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.165
Put three bottles on ice.
Good ones.

01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:20.124
The best.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.207
What you miss most abroad

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:31.082
is champagne.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.582
I've brought someone with me.
He's a buddy.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:41.374
Treat him... good.

01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:43.665
Of course we will.

01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:49.457
When we're alone, I'll tell you
a new story. You'll like it.

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.457
You can keep it.

01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:52.999
Too bad for you.

01:03:55.041 --> 01:03:56.790
Get off. You're too heavy.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.457
Well I never...

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:00.957
You scram too. You're tickling.

01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:05.040
Come here, you.
The new girl.

01:04:11.708 --> 01:04:13.290
Leave her to me.

01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:23.124
Take her, kid, if you want her.
Have fun. She's your age.

01:04:32.666 --> 01:04:35.082
I'd have slit my father's throat
for less.

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:39.707
But friendship comes first.
We mustn't fight over una zorra.

01:04:44.416 --> 01:04:45.915
Say...

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.457
Your friend seems timid.

01:04:47.625 --> 01:04:48.790
Timid isn't the word.

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:52.415
The champagne's served.
Aren't you thirsty?

01:04:57.166 --> 01:04:59.832
- What's your name?
- Belle de Jour.

01:05:00.541 --> 01:05:01.915
What else?

01:05:02.291 --> 01:05:03.332
Nothing.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.790
Don't you trust me?

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:07.415
I want to know your name.

01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:12.540
Aren't you here at night?
What do you do then?

01:05:14.291 --> 01:05:15.874
Nice boots!

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:23.499
Your teeth...

01:05:23.666 --> 01:05:24.999
What happened?

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:27.540
Knocked out in one blow.

01:05:29.916 --> 01:05:31.665
Does it bother you?

01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:33.874
Then make it fast.

01:05:39.166 --> 01:05:41.374
- How old are you?
- 23.

01:05:42.416 --> 01:05:44.207
Who protects you?

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:45.707
What do you mean?

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:47.332
Are you free or not?

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:51.124
Make plenty of money?

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:53.707
Yes, but...

01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:55.624
Don't tell me any lies.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.749
Keep your stockings on.

01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:00.915
A girl once tried to strangle me.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.249
Poor thing...

01:06:03.416 --> 01:06:04.957
With you, it's free.

01:06:06.666 --> 01:06:08.332
Naturally!

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.124
Many would like to be in your place.

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:14.165
Still won't tell me your name?

01:06:15.416 --> 01:06:17.040
You don't talk much.

01:06:17.458 --> 01:06:20.582
Good. Can't stand girls
who chatter.

01:06:22.125 --> 01:06:23.874
Not bad.

01:06:25.916 --> 01:06:27.790
Shame you only have two of them.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.707
Let's see.

01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:31.457
Turn around.

01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:36.165
What's that brown spot?

01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:37.707
A birthmark.

01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:40.082
Oh hell! I don't like that!

01:06:40.666 --> 01:06:42.207
Get dressed.

01:06:46.291 --> 01:06:48.707
Not cold enough, as usual.

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:50.165
You read English?

01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:52.665
- Me? No.
- So why the paper?

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:54.499
What's it to do with you?

01:06:58.458 --> 01:06:59.707
Enough!

01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:03.207
Take that one to the room.
I'll join you.

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:05.290
The other's for Marcel.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.165
Who is your friend?

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:13.040
He saved my life last year.
I love him like a son.

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:15.915
That's why I let him
have the blonde.

01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:17.624
Where does she come from?

01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:19.499
- Belle de Jour?
- Yes.

01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:21.540
Is she much in demand?

01:07:21.708 --> 01:07:22.957
All the time.

01:07:23.458 --> 01:07:25.790
She not only has class but...

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:27.249
What?

01:07:27.416 --> 01:07:29.124
She's a pearl.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.749
I thought you wanted to go.

01:07:39.416 --> 01:07:41.249
I'm glad I stayed.

01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:44.499
I'll tell you. You're my type.

01:07:46.708 --> 01:07:49.874
Look at my hand.
It's still trembling.

01:07:54.083 --> 01:07:55.540
What's that?

01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:57.874
A buttonhole.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.290
- A knife wound?
- Possibly.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.874
Why do you come here?

01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:04.749
Don't ask me anything.

01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:08.207
I'd like to keep you till tonight
but I can't.

01:08:08.791 --> 01:08:10.832
I like you too, Marcel.

01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:12.624
You'll come back?

01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:14.165
It's possible.

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:17.290
- If you've no money, I can...
- Money!

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:19.874
It's not money I need.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.957
You frighten me.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.332
- I can see you're bored.
- No.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.582
I just want to go back to Paris.

01:08:56.625 --> 01:08:58.790
You know you can tell me
everything,

01:08:58.957 --> 01:09:00.749
but you're hiding something.

01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:05.582
If only you'd confide in me,
perhaps I could help you.

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.165
Confide what?

01:09:08.082 --> 01:09:09.832
That you love someone.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.707
Someone else?

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.374
You know I couldn't.

01:09:15.457 --> 01:09:17.290
I suggested this holiday

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:19.957
to find out if something
was keeping you in Paris.

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:22.374
I was right.
You want to go back.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:25.207
Above all I feel...

01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:27.499
your aloofness.

01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:30.165
You're never really...
with me.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.665
Forgive me.

01:09:33.082 --> 01:09:34.749
It's probably my fault.

01:09:35.082 --> 01:09:37.332
You believe I don't love you?

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.999
Yes, I think so.

01:09:44.666 --> 01:09:46.749
<i>I don't know how to explain.</i>

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.749
<i>There are many things</i>
<i>I don't understand myself.</i>

01:09:50.916 --> 01:09:52.707
<i>Things about myself.</i>

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:55.832
<i>My feelings for you</i>
<i>have nothing to do with pleasure.</i>

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.665
<i>It's much more than that.</i>

01:09:57.833 --> 01:10:01.874
<i>You may not believe this,</i>
<i>but I've never felt so close to you.</i>

01:10:02.833 --> 01:10:04.374
You want to go back to Paris?

01:10:04.708 --> 01:10:06.707
But I'm not bored with you.

01:10:06.875 --> 01:10:08.707
Let's stay another week.

01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:12.040
No, we'll leave tomorrow.
I must go back anyway.

01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:30.207
See you soon.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.874
Troubles, Mr Marcel?

01:10:33.041 --> 01:10:36.124
Never seen anyone
hooked like you are.

01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:37.415
Stop it, will you!

01:10:37.583 --> 01:10:40.957
Behaving like an imbecile,
not like a man.

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:51.874
We waited for you Thursday.

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:55.749
- So what?
- Next time, we won't wait. Get me?

01:10:56.166 --> 01:10:57.749
We nearly didn't come today either.

01:10:57.916 --> 01:10:58.999
Really?

01:10:59.666 --> 01:11:03.915
The inflation's lasted long enough.
We're sick of you and your goon.

01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:07.082
Not with that yellow rat.

01:11:08.041 --> 01:11:11.707
Please, gentlemen, go outside.

01:11:12.125 --> 01:11:14.040
Shut your trap!

01:11:15.416 --> 01:11:18.332
The snow.
We know you've got it.

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:26.665
We're not keeping you.

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:30.790
I'll settle with you
about the goon.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.040
As you like.

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:06.665
Pierrot, an anisette.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:17.457
Where are you going?

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.457
- To phone.
- Again?

01:12:23.541 --> 01:12:26.290
What a curse these women are!

01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:29.832
How right you are. He's hooked.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.665
It's cost him dearly.
It's always been his trouble.

01:12:33.833 --> 01:12:36.124
But I can't do anything.

01:12:36.291 --> 01:12:38.665
Hello, Anaïs. It's Marcel.

01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:40.582
Any news?

01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:43.874
Since when?

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:45.790
Really?

01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:49.124
I'm on my way.

01:12:56.791 --> 01:12:59.707
He had his father on his back.

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:03.790
Six letters with an A.

01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:06.707
Aeneas.

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:10.624
You're right!
It often comes up in crosswords.

01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:15.415
Belle, it's him again.
He's waiting for you.

01:13:26.916 --> 01:13:29.082
Hello. How are you?

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:38.207
Where have you been?
And why?

01:13:38.833 --> 01:13:41.290
I had to go away for a few days.

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:44.165
- I'll explain.
- I'll explain too.

01:13:44.333 --> 01:13:46.540
And leave my signature.

01:13:53.458 --> 01:13:55.457
Don't mark my face.

01:13:59.458 --> 01:14:02.374
If you do that again,
I'll go away forever.

01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:07.249
Okay for this time.

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:34.290
I missed you, you know.

01:14:35.666 --> 01:14:38.040
I shouldn't say this,
but I waited for you.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.040
Now I want to see more of you...
at night too.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.415
You can see me every day.

01:14:45.708 --> 01:14:48.040
- You know I'm not free.
- I don't care.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.540
I don't understand.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.624
You seem to like being with me.

01:15:06.791 --> 01:15:09.832
Very much.
But it's not enough.

01:15:10.583 --> 01:15:12.665
You love the other guy?

01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:15.957
Why come here then?

01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:19.374
I don't know...
It's two different things.

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:46.332
I'm starving.
Where shall we eat?

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.582
Let's decide on the way.

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:51.374
I won't be long. I'll be back by 3.

01:15:52.833 --> 01:15:55.332
I scarcely recognize you.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.832
- I'm so glad to see you smile.
- I certainly feel better.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.749
I've never seen you like this.

01:16:00.916 --> 01:16:02.707
- If only...
- What?

01:16:03.083 --> 01:16:06.290
Oh, nothing. But if only you had
some great news for me one day.

01:16:06.458 --> 01:16:09.040
- What do you mean?
- You know very well...

01:16:09.208 --> 01:16:12.374
What I want most of all: a child.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.832
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

01:16:31.583 --> 01:16:34.999
This thing. I don't know why.
It's odd.

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:38.124
- Nothing odd about it.
- No, you're right.

01:16:46.708 --> 01:16:49.582
Hello, stranger!
I hardly recognized you.

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:53.624
You forgot about us, didn't you?
We haven't seen you for ages.

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:56.374
You haven't changed much.

01:16:56.541 --> 01:16:58.249
First door on the right.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.582
Come here, girls.
It's an old friend.

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:10.415
Come along. Get moving.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.499
Yes, you're all lovely.

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:22.082
- You flatter me.
- Not at all, Sir.

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:24.040
I remember you very well.

01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:27.207
Sometimes, I even dream of you.

01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:30.207
I don't care much for that.

01:17:30.375 --> 01:17:32.707
- Oh no, Sir.
- I insist.

01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:39.999
Hello, ladies.
Please sit down.

01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:43.999
Mathilde, Charlotte
and Belle de Jour.

01:17:44.166 --> 01:17:46.999
Belle de Jour? Original name.

01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:50.915
Shall I get you a drink?

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.915
Later on.

01:17:54.416 --> 01:17:56.082
Nothing has changed here.

01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:58.832
Still the same simple,
friendly welcome.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.374
The same curtains...

01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:05.165
What happened
to the lion tamer girl?

01:18:07.166 --> 01:18:08.415
I don't know.

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.707
The heating's turned on full?

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:12.665
You haven't changed either.

01:18:12.833 --> 01:18:14.790
And the armchair...

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:18.624
It was snowing.

01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:21.582
Still the same unusual perfume.

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:23.582
Faithful to jasmine...

01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:26.332
You'll stay for a while, I hope.

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.957
All my life. I've plenty of time.

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:34.165
I'd like to be alone
with Belle de Jour.

01:18:39.708 --> 01:18:41.582
No! I don't want to.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.540
What is this?

01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:45.290
Stay here!

01:18:47.916 --> 01:18:49.999
She's very nice...

01:18:51.208 --> 01:18:53.457
But she can be a bit nervous.

01:18:56.875 --> 01:18:58.624
Pleased with yourself?

01:18:58.958 --> 01:19:01.249
You knew I was here.

01:19:01.666 --> 01:19:03.124
You are mistaken.

01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:06.124
It's your fault.
You gave me the address.

01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.915
- You're mistaken.
- Don't come near me

01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:11.332
or I'll jump out of the window.

01:19:17.916 --> 01:19:19.207
Is that your bed?

01:19:19.375 --> 01:19:21.249
You disgust me,
you know that.

01:19:21.416 --> 01:19:24.540
Yes, that's my bed.
What else do you want to know?

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.290
You like being humiliated.

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:28.915
I don't.

01:19:30.541 --> 01:19:32.332
Don't tell Pierre!

01:19:32.875 --> 01:19:35.832
I admire him more and more.

01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:39.374
Please, don't tell him.

01:19:39.916 --> 01:19:42.165
Try to understand.

01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:43.790
I'm lost.

01:19:44.333 --> 01:19:47.707
It happens in spite of me.
I can't resist.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:51.665
One day I shall have to pay
for my sins.

01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:55.040
But without this I could not live.

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:58.749
Do whatever you want with me.

01:20:00.916 --> 01:20:02.499
Not now, in any case...

01:20:02.958 --> 01:20:07.415
What attracted me about you was...
your virtue.

01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:11.249
You were the wife of a boy scout.
That has all changed.

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:14.207
I have principles.
I am not like you.

01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:17.374
I shall, of course,
say nothing to Pierre.

01:20:18.416 --> 01:20:21.790
But I have friends
who would be good customers.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.332
Forgive me.

01:20:25.666 --> 01:20:27.499
I really don't feel like it.

01:20:28.875 --> 01:20:30.915
Another time, perhaps.

01:20:31.083 --> 01:20:32.540
Who knows?

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:34.749
I don't want to waste your time.

01:20:42.083 --> 01:20:45.832
This isn't for you. Buy some
chocolates for Pierre from me.

01:21:35.041 --> 01:21:37.082
All set? Go!

01:21:42.291 --> 01:21:43.749
Get ready.

01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:45.374
Fire!

01:22:24.208 --> 01:22:26.082
He's gone already?

01:22:26.958 --> 01:22:28.790
I want to speak to you.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.207
Run along.

01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:40.707
- I must go away.
- When?

01:22:40.875 --> 01:22:43.499
- Now.
- You'll come back?

01:22:43.666 --> 01:22:45.665
- No, I won't.
- What?

01:22:46.791 --> 01:22:49.165
You might have told me
a little sooner.

01:22:49.333 --> 01:22:50.707
Aren't you happy here?

01:22:50.875 --> 01:22:52.707
Oh yes, only...

01:22:53.166 --> 01:22:54.749
Yes, I understand...

01:22:56.625 --> 01:22:58.249
It's Marcel.

01:22:59.166 --> 01:23:01.249
He was here just now.
He was furious.

01:23:01.416 --> 01:23:03.624
Nearly broke into your room.

01:23:04.416 --> 01:23:06.957
Something's not right.

01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:09.624
He's become too demanding.

01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:13.415
He wants you for himself
day and night.

01:23:17.541 --> 01:23:19.874
Always the same trouble with men.

01:23:21.125 --> 01:23:23.415
Go away. You're quite right.

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.749
One of these days
there could be trouble.

01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:29.790
But I'll be sorry to lose you.

01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:32.499
Women like you are...

01:23:33.291 --> 01:23:36.707
- We got on well, you and me.
- Yes, that's true.

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:40.832
Keep in touch if you can.
A phone call from time to time...

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.665
would make me very happy.

01:23:42.833 --> 01:23:44.915
- Can't you give me an address?
- No.

01:23:46.416 --> 01:23:48.790
Well, too bad. What can I say?

01:24:59.375 --> 01:25:01.665
A gentleman to see you,
Madame.

01:25:01.833 --> 01:25:03.332
- Me?
- Yes, Madame.

01:25:03.833 --> 01:25:05.124
Do you know him?

01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:08.082
No, Madame.
He says it's urgent.

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:20.124
- Do you have the catalogue?
- Yes, Madame.

01:25:20.291 --> 01:25:21.124
Sit down.

01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:22.915
Thank you, Maria.

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:26.665
Good idea, asking for a catalogue.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:31.040
Nice place you have.

01:25:31.208 --> 01:25:33.457
What are you doing here?
Go away!

01:25:33.625 --> 01:25:37.790
When I didn't see you any more,
I thought I'd pay you a visit...

01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:39.665
to see how you were.

01:25:40.458 --> 01:25:42.790
- How did you find me?
- Child's play.

01:25:43.333 --> 01:25:44.915
Your husband?

01:25:45.333 --> 01:25:48.082
Good-looking guy! Handsome!

01:25:49.625 --> 01:25:50.374
Much better than me.

01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:54.207
- Please go away!
- Don't worry. I won't make a fuss.

01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:57.415
I only wanted to know
why you left.

01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:00.790
- You hear?
- Don't shout. The maid will hear.

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:03.082
Just go. He'll be back soon.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.374
You're not very hospitable.

01:26:06.708 --> 01:26:08.582
- What do you want?
- To see you again.

01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:11.415
It's impossible.
I'm never going back there!

01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:18.582
I'll give you three days.

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:20.790
Find an excuse. Anything.

01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:24.082
I'll meet you at the Hotel du Bois.
Rue Fromentin.

01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:26.415
You'll stay the night.

01:26:26.583 --> 01:26:27.790
It's impossible.

01:26:32.875 --> 01:26:35.249
Then I'll wait for him.

01:26:37.833 --> 01:26:39.290
I've lots to tell him.

01:26:39.458 --> 01:26:41.707
- You wouldn't do that!
- I would.

01:26:41.875 --> 01:26:44.415
I didn't want to,
but you force me to.

01:26:45.541 --> 01:26:47.832
After all, maybe it's for the best.

01:26:48.458 --> 01:26:51.332
- I'd decided to tell him all, too.
- Is that so?

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.665
He'd have found out sooner or later.

01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:55.957
A friend of ours saw me there.

01:26:56.333 --> 01:26:58.207
Anyhow, I've had enough.

01:27:00.375 --> 01:27:02.832
That's fine.
Let's wait for him.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.457
We'll tell him everything together.
I don't mind.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.499
Oh please!

01:27:17.875 --> 01:27:19.540
Go away before he comes.

01:27:32.875 --> 01:27:34.374
Don't be afraid.

01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:36.457
I'll go.

01:27:37.666 --> 01:27:40.249
I didn't believe you,
but I understand now.

01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:47.290
There's the obstacle.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.374
See you soon.

01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:35.957
See her?

01:28:36.125 --> 01:28:37.832
Leave me the car.

01:28:38.208 --> 01:28:40.374
- Where are you going?
- I need it.

01:28:40.916 --> 01:28:43.332
Leave the car and get out.

01:28:43.833 --> 01:28:45.499
What are you up to?

01:28:47.083 --> 01:28:48.832
Get out, I tell you.

01:28:49.583 --> 01:28:52.790
This time, kid, I've had it.

01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:19.957
Hey, I won't let you run off
like that!

01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:11.290
Well?

01:31:11.458 --> 01:31:13.582
The killer's dead.
The police are baffled.

01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:16.290
He hit the wrong guy
or else he was mad.

01:31:16.458 --> 01:31:18.374
- Who was he?
- A gangster.

01:31:18.541 --> 01:31:21.582
- It seems he had quite a record.
- That's odd.

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:24.124
- And how's Sérizy?
- It's too early to say.

01:31:24.291 --> 01:31:26.207
His wife's in the waiting room.

01:31:47.666 --> 01:31:49.165
How is he?

01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:52.457
Too early to say.
But he'll live.

01:31:52.791 --> 01:31:55.540
- May I see him?
- No. He's still in a coma.

01:31:55.708 --> 01:31:57.124
Tomorrow, perhaps.

01:31:57.291 --> 01:32:00.624
Go home and get some rest.

01:32:00.791 --> 01:32:03.665
We'll keep you informed
every hour, I promise.

01:32:05.541 --> 01:32:07.040
Don't worry.

01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:13.332
Come along.
I'll go with you.

01:33:22.166 --> 01:33:24.624
I've sent Marie out
for the newspapers.

01:33:24.791 --> 01:33:27.374
I'll read you the articles
that interest you.

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:31.874
Marie is very kind.

01:33:32.041 --> 01:33:33.749
She likes you a lot.

01:33:36.875 --> 01:33:38.915
Everybody's asking about you.

01:33:41.208 --> 01:33:42.707
You're much better.

01:33:42.875 --> 01:33:44.957
The doctor is very optimistic.

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:48.665
You don't realize it,
but you're making great progress,

01:33:48.833 --> 01:33:50.624
especially your eyes.

01:33:52.083 --> 01:33:55.957
It's funny. Since your... accident,

01:33:56.125 --> 01:33:57.707
I've not been dreaming.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.415
It's time for your medicine.

01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:32.165
Monsieur Husson.
To see Monsieur Sérizy.

01:34:38.208 --> 01:34:39.665
I'm coming.

01:34:52.416 --> 01:34:54.290
I am very sorry to disturb you.

01:34:54.791 --> 01:34:56.457
You want to see Pierre?

01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:58.332
Just a moment.

01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:01.665
He still can't speak. He is...

01:35:01.833 --> 01:35:03.499
I know.

01:35:03.666 --> 01:35:05.165
Sorry I didn't come sooner.

01:35:05.333 --> 01:35:08.415
You know what I think of Pierre.
I was away on a trip.

01:35:09.041 --> 01:35:10.499
A pretty dress!

01:35:11.708 --> 01:35:14.415
Like a precocious schoolgirl.

01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:19.124
- What will you tell him?
- Everything I know about you.

01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:21.957
Keep calm!

01:35:23.125 --> 01:35:26.999
He's paralysed
and feels he's a burden to you.

01:35:29.375 --> 01:35:32.165
That makes him ashamed,
because he thinks you're pure.

01:35:32.333 --> 01:35:35.165
That's why I want to tell him
everything.

01:35:36.541 --> 01:35:39.374
It will hurt him...
but it will be for the best.

01:35:42.625 --> 01:35:45.249
Who could accuse me
of being cruel?

01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:49.999
Show me in, please.

01:35:52.583 --> 01:35:54.040
He's through there.

01:35:59.708 --> 01:36:02.332
Do you want to be present?

01:38:30.583 --> 01:38:31.999
What are you thinking about?

01:38:34.833 --> 01:38:36.499
About you, Pierre.

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.165
I'm thirsty.

01:38:58.416 --> 01:38:59.832
Shall I get some ice?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.707
No, don't bother.

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:06.332
I think I can take
two weeks off in February.

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.915
- To go to the mountains?
- If you want.

01:39:22.041 --> 01:39:23.749
Do you hear that?

01:39:58.958 --> 01:40:03.957
THE END
