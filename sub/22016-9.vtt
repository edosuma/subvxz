WEBVTT

00:00.832 --> 00:02.683
Ready for
your big camping trip?

00:02.751 --> 00:03.784
Are you sure you got
everything you need?

00:03.852 --> 00:06.872
Everything but the one thing
I'd truly be lost without...

00:06.939 --> 00:07.622
Your Camry.

00:07.689 --> 00:08.940
My GPS is broken.

00:09.008 --> 00:09.941
Can we trade cars?

00:10.009 --> 00:12.911
I recently left
my real-estate partners

00:12.979 --> 00:14.829
to strike out on my own.

00:14.896 --> 00:17.749
But before facing the wilds
of the housing market,

00:17.816 --> 00:19.401
I'm gonna boost my confidence

00:19.468 --> 00:21.486
with six rugged nights
of camping

00:21.554 --> 00:23.104
at Yosemite National Park

00:23.172 --> 00:24.689
and one
at the Kawayu Lodge.

00:24.757 --> 00:27.526
I'm concerned,
of course,

00:27.593 --> 00:29.844
about readjusting
to civilization,

00:29.912 --> 00:31.980
so I've reserved
the garden suite

00:32.046 --> 00:34.850
in case I'm more comfortable
sleeping outside.

00:36.652 --> 00:37.769
Uh...

00:37.771 --> 00:40.271
only because
I am picturing myself

00:40.323 --> 00:42.857
in a line of people
sweeping the woods
with flashlights.

00:42.924 --> 00:46.044
Are you sure a week
in the woods is a good idea?

00:46.112 --> 00:47.945
Sweetheart, if anything,
I'm over prepared.

00:48.114 --> 00:49.714
I have two weeks
worth of food,

00:49.781 --> 00:51.366
water purifiers...

00:51.433 --> 00:52.750
a flare gun.

00:52.818 --> 00:54.302
Oh, don't wave
that thing around
in the house.

00:54.370 --> 00:55.786
Give me a little bit
of credit.

00:55.854 --> 00:57.005
I'm not gonna shoot off
a flare gun in the house.

01:13.505 --> 01:15.957
Hey, Lily,
the library is saying

01:16.025 --> 01:17.208
that "Stripey the Zebracorn"

01:17.276 --> 01:18.709
is two months overdue?

01:18.777 --> 01:19.861
What -- what's that about?

01:19.929 --> 01:20.978
We have a new librarian,

01:21.046 --> 01:22.730
and she's a little...

01:22.798 --> 01:24.616
She's been drunk e-mailing
a lot.

01:24.684 --> 01:26.484
Oh, that poor thing.

01:26.552 --> 01:27.902
Lily, go find that book.

01:27.970 --> 01:30.021
And the fine's coming
out of your allowance.

01:30.089 --> 01:32.240
You'll really believe
anything, won't you?

01:32.308 --> 01:33.391
I will not.

01:33.458 --> 01:34.659
Really? Okay...

01:34.727 --> 01:36.727
Um, hey, remember when you
had your grandmother

01:36.795 --> 01:39.480
ship us a certain
Appalachian hex poppet

01:39.548 --> 01:42.050
because you thought our house
had evil spirits?
Okay, yeah.

01:42.118 --> 01:43.384
Do you have
a better explanation

01:43.452 --> 01:44.969
of why there were
cries and giggles

01:45.037 --> 01:46.154
echoing
through our walls?
Yes.

01:46.221 --> 01:49.407
Our contractor found this
in one of the vents.

01:49.474 --> 01:50.341
Listen...

01:51.610 --> 01:53.561
I think it's
one of those dolls

01:53.629 --> 01:54.812
they give
high-school girls

01:54.880 --> 01:56.681
who are high risk
for getting pregnant?

01:56.748 --> 01:57.849
When would
one of those girls

01:57.916 --> 01:59.184
have been
in this house?

02:00.319 --> 02:03.304
I think
I was babysitting Lily,

02:03.372 --> 02:06.190
and I kinda remember it
turning into a party situation.

02:06.258 --> 02:09.393
You know, I sort of recall
the air conditioning blasting

02:09.461 --> 02:11.112
and I had to shove something
in the vent to block it,

02:11.180 --> 02:12.613
which was pretty responsible,

02:12.681 --> 02:13.981
considering my friend Alicia

02:14.066 --> 02:15.083
brought
her actual baby there.

02:16.502 --> 02:18.336
So many teens
going down the wrong path.

02:18.404 --> 02:19.553
I see it every day.

02:19.621 --> 02:21.089
Uh, seems like you're trying
to change the subject

02:21.157 --> 02:22.624
from you being gullible.

02:22.691 --> 02:24.842
Only because I have
a more pressing concern.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.078
Today, I have to oversee
my first detention

02:27.146 --> 02:28.546
as acting vice principal,

02:28.614 --> 02:30.198
and I'm -- I've just been
racking my brain

02:30.266 --> 02:32.016
of how I'm gonna
reach these kids.

02:32.084 --> 02:33.568
It's, uh, detention.

02:33.586 --> 02:34.535
How about "shut up
and do your homework"?

02:38.207 --> 02:39.157
What's --
what's wrong with her?

02:39.225 --> 02:40.341
Should I get
the hex poppet?

02:40.408 --> 02:42.010
I'm just cry-talking.

02:42.077 --> 02:44.145
I threw my neck out
changing Cal.
Oh, no.

02:44.213 --> 02:46.981
Now whenever I move,
all of me comes with it.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.266
Oh, gosh.
Oh, you know what?

02:48.334 --> 02:50.802
Why don't you let us
take baby Cal,

02:50.870 --> 02:53.254
and you go get yourself
a rubdown.

02:53.322 --> 02:55.440
You're an angel.

02:55.491 --> 02:58.225
Shouldn't be
but a few hours.

02:58.293 --> 03:00.878
Hey,
are you an even bigger
rube than I thought?

03:00.946 --> 03:02.447
There's nothing wrong
with her neck.

03:02.498 --> 03:04.115
Oh my God, the baby!
What?!

03:04.183 --> 03:05.816
No!

03:05.884 --> 03:08.402
He --
He winked at me.

03:08.470 --> 03:09.654
You're gonna love it, Joe.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.489
My dad took me
to an air show like this

03:11.557 --> 03:12.823
for my 12th birthday.

03:12.891 --> 03:15.293
We saw Blue Angels,
fighter jets,

03:15.295 --> 03:17.061
a B-52 bomber.

03:17.129 --> 03:18.612
Something got bombed?
Well, my dad.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.099
He got in a drinking contest
with some fly boys.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.851
But that just
made it extra fun,

03:22.918 --> 03:24.368
'cause
I got to drive us home.

03:24.436 --> 03:26.087
Joe, why is the fort

03:26.105 --> 03:28.339
still in the middle
of the living room?

03:28.407 --> 03:30.742
I need it.
For what? Apaches?

03:30.809 --> 03:32.042
Are you being attacked?

03:32.110 --> 03:33.427
Feels like it.

03:33.495 --> 03:34.428
Take it down.

03:34.496 --> 03:35.830
I've told you
three times already.

03:35.897 --> 03:36.965
If you don't do it now,

03:37.032 --> 03:38.917
we're not
going to the air show.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.870
Wait, no fair!
Why am I being punished?

03:41.937 --> 03:44.572
Oh, I didn't expect
you guys to be home.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.257
Uh, we're just gonna
use the pool.

03:46.325 --> 03:47.441
Jay, Gloria...

03:47.509 --> 03:48.560
Gloria?

03:48.627 --> 03:49.694
This is Dr. Karen Fisk.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.462
She's a movement teacher
at my school.

03:51.530 --> 03:52.981
Your son
is very talented.

03:53.049 --> 03:54.549
Well,
it's always very nice

03:54.616 --> 03:56.651
to meet
one of Manny's teachers.

03:56.719 --> 03:58.135
Why don't I get us
something to drink

03:58.203 --> 03:59.871
and maybe
some delicious brownies

03:59.939 --> 04:01.555
that I was about
to throw away

04:01.623 --> 04:03.825
because they're only
for the good children!

04:03.893 --> 04:06.961
Keep your brownies!

04:07.029 --> 04:08.763
It's cute,
that grown-up routine

04:08.831 --> 04:11.066
Manny's putting on
to impress his girlfriend.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.650
She's not his girlfriend.

04:12.718 --> 04:14.085
She's his teacher.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.286
Gloria,
he brought her home

04:15.353 --> 04:16.803
when he thought
no one would be around.

04:16.872 --> 04:19.339
Manny has been
bringing his teachers home

04:19.406 --> 04:20.958
since he was a little kid.

04:21.026 --> 04:24.295
His 9th birthday party
turned into a PTA meeting.

04:24.363 --> 04:26.280
Gloria, I think
you're just not seeing

04:26.365 --> 04:27.748
what you don't
want to see.

04:27.816 --> 04:30.334
Believe me, Jay,
I see everything.

04:32.538 --> 04:33.888
The dentist says
your new mouth guard

04:33.956 --> 04:35.273
should be there tomorrow.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.759
Alex, I am sure you can
make it through one night...

04:37.826 --> 04:39.477
I-I don't know,

04:39.544 --> 04:42.163
hit the materials lab
and whip up some mouth flubber.

04:42.231 --> 04:43.498
Oh, Claire,
thank goodness.

04:43.566 --> 04:45.900
There was a bit of
a trucking mix-up.
Mm-hmm.

04:45.967 --> 04:48.453
Irving was sent to Julian
and can't get to Visalia.

04:48.521 --> 04:50.321
Well,
send Dustin to Visalia

04:50.389 --> 04:52.823
and have Irving
hit Julian and Ramona.

04:52.891 --> 04:55.359
Dustin can't hit Visalia
and also Irvine.

04:55.427 --> 04:57.278
Well,
can Julia hit Irvine?

04:57.346 --> 04:59.297
Not Irvine and Tustin.
Fine.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.232
Send Julia to Julian,
Ramon to Ramona,

05:01.283 --> 05:03.084
Dustin to Tustin,
Irving to Irvine,

05:03.152 --> 05:05.086
and I'll drive the damn truck
to Visalia!

05:05.153 --> 05:07.372
You?
Yes, of course me,
Margaret!

05:07.439 --> 05:09.657
'Cause I have to handle
everything anyhow!

05:09.724 --> 05:11.258
If not me, who?

05:11.326 --> 05:13.912
Oh, no.
Mi Hu is going to Carlsbad.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.314
These are your future,

05:17.382 --> 05:21.436
And they're headed...out...

05:21.504 --> 05:22.937
the window...

05:23.004 --> 05:24.055
never to return.

05:24.122 --> 05:25.223
You drop this, Coach?

05:25.290 --> 05:27.225
Yes.

05:28.594 --> 05:29.644
Oh, it must be Halloween,

05:29.711 --> 05:30.861
because somebody's
passing out snickers!

05:30.929 --> 05:32.079
Shane?

05:32.147 --> 05:33.464
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

05:33.532 --> 05:34.765
Oh, it's okay, Shane.

05:34.833 --> 05:35.967
I know your type.

05:36.034 --> 05:37.752
Tough guy. Know it all.

05:37.820 --> 05:38.987
It's like
looking in a mirror.

05:39.054 --> 05:40.154
That's right, Shane.

05:40.221 --> 05:41.355
I was you.

05:41.423 --> 05:43.441
Till a local sheriff
put me in jail.

05:43.492 --> 05:46.527
In a little program
called Scared Straight,

05:46.595 --> 05:47.996
which, now that
I'm saying it out loud,

05:48.063 --> 05:49.614
could have had
a double meaning.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.000
24 hours in the joint

05:52.067 --> 05:54.035
with some of
the most dangerous characters

05:54.102 --> 05:56.054
this side of Hell.

05:56.121 --> 05:57.571
Maybe, uh...

05:57.639 --> 05:59.323
Maybe you'd like
to meet some of them.

06:02.861 --> 06:04.229
I don't know what
you're lookin' at,

06:04.296 --> 06:08.967
'cause I don't ever remember
sellin' you a lookin' license!

06:09.034 --> 06:11.286
Hey, it must be 5:00 a.m.

06:11.353 --> 06:12.203
outside the McDonald's,

06:12.270 --> 06:15.106
because the fresh meat
just got delivered!

06:15.173 --> 06:17.424
And the Weasel
likes fresh meat!

06:17.492 --> 06:19.010
Hey, you back off him!

06:19.061 --> 06:21.162
That new boy's mine!

06:21.229 --> 06:24.032
Oh...Uncle Cam...

06:24.099 --> 06:25.583
"Like."

06:25.650 --> 06:26.934
My friend, Billy.

06:27.002 --> 06:28.002
Billy Club.

06:28.070 --> 06:29.887
Ay, Cam...
Whack!

06:29.955 --> 06:31.638
"Like."

06:33.358 --> 06:35.243
Do you even know
how to drive a truck?

06:35.311 --> 06:37.295
No, Margaret, I don't...

06:37.379 --> 06:39.047
but unlike
the rest of the world,

06:39.114 --> 06:41.448
sometimes I just
figure things out on my own.

06:43.118 --> 06:45.936
Backing up...

06:46.004 --> 06:47.439
Back --

06:49.725 --> 06:51.242
Shut up, Margaret.

06:51.309 --> 06:53.928
Survival vlog, entry one.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.380
After a five-mile hike
and a ride down some rapids,

06:56.448 --> 06:58.233
I've decided
to make my camp here.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.817
The rapids were treacherous.

06:59.884 --> 07:01.402
I took on water

07:01.470 --> 07:03.404
and quickly realized
my only chance for survival

07:03.472 --> 07:05.639
was to push my companion
overboard --

07:05.707 --> 07:07.775
my constant companion...

07:07.843 --> 07:09.394
fear.

07:09.461 --> 07:11.145
Please stay
out of my blind spot.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.246
Merging.

07:12.314 --> 07:13.831
Merging!

07:13.899 --> 07:15.232
Sorry!

07:15.300 --> 07:16.617
Here's the thing.

07:16.685 --> 07:17.751
In the wild,

07:17.819 --> 07:18.986
you either shrink
from the challenge,

07:19.054 --> 07:20.538
or you realize that confidence
is half the battle

07:20.606 --> 07:22.740
and you become
the master of your environment.

07:22.808 --> 07:24.992
Okay...

07:25.060 --> 07:26.293
All right.

07:26.361 --> 07:27.645
Thank you, thank you.

07:27.713 --> 07:28.695
Thank you.

07:28.763 --> 07:30.414
This isn't so bad.

07:30.482 --> 07:31.615
Yeah.

07:31.683 --> 07:33.234
That's right, Prius...

07:33.302 --> 07:34.302
move it.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.970
Yep.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.972
Sometimes it's just
a matter of thrusting
your chest out,

07:38.040 --> 07:39.824
staking your claim...

07:39.892 --> 07:41.141
and letting nature know

07:41.209 --> 07:44.028
there's a new sheriff
in town.

07:52.253 --> 07:53.955
This chorizo,
these plantains,

07:54.022 --> 07:55.390
it's all so delicious.

07:55.457 --> 07:57.441
When did you develop
a taste for Colombian?

07:57.509 --> 07:59.343
It's called
bandeja paisa.

07:59.411 --> 08:00.744
Oh, talented, smart,

08:00.796 --> 08:02.413
and speaks Spanish.

08:04.232 --> 08:05.233
Oh, please.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.535
Everybody wants
to touch those cheeks.

08:07.603 --> 08:09.520
He looks like
one of those babies

08:09.587 --> 08:10.654
that blow a cloud

08:10.722 --> 08:12.573
across the ceiling
of a church.

08:12.641 --> 08:15.576
So, tell us, Dr. Karen,
what do you teach?

08:15.643 --> 08:17.228
Well, the best way
would be to show you.

08:17.295 --> 08:20.447
Why don't
we find our legs?
Fun.

08:20.515 --> 08:22.866
Now stand beside me
and follow along.
Mm-hmm.

08:22.934 --> 08:27.405
Imagine you're carrying
two pails of water.

08:27.472 --> 08:28.840
Uh-huh. Deep breath.

08:28.907 --> 08:30.224
No, no, no.

08:30.291 --> 08:31.275
Your chest
shouldn't be lifting.

08:31.343 --> 08:32.710
Come place your hands
on my neck.

08:35.547 --> 08:37.965
Do you feel how still
and open my breathing is?

08:38.033 --> 08:39.216
Oh, a little sensitive
there.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.985
Yeah, you have
a little bite there.

08:41.052 --> 08:42.803
Oh, my bad.

08:42.871 --> 08:44.688
Okay, that's a little tight.

08:44.756 --> 08:47.291
But I can see where Manny
gets his soft hands from!

08:47.358 --> 08:50.094
Oh, that's very,
very eye-opening.
Mom. Mom.

08:50.162 --> 08:52.546
Uh, let's check on the dessert
in the kitchen.

08:54.883 --> 08:55.950
What kind of schools

08:56.018 --> 08:58.186
allow a teacher
to date a student?

08:58.253 --> 08:59.720
I'm guessing
any art school.

08:59.787 --> 09:02.139
He can't date
a 30 year old.

09:02.207 --> 09:03.991
Manny's still a child.

09:04.059 --> 09:06.144
Manny wasn't a child
when I met him.

09:06.211 --> 09:07.511
Look,
there was a 10-year period

09:07.579 --> 09:09.213
where there was at least
one empty chair

09:09.281 --> 09:10.281
at my house
every Thanksgiving

09:10.348 --> 09:11.682
because I had
a lot to say

09:11.834 --> 09:14.085
about who Mitchell and Claire
were dating.

09:14.153 --> 09:17.989
So, learn from my one and only
parental mistake.

09:19.241 --> 09:21.158
Uh, maybe Karen and I
should head out.

09:21.226 --> 09:23.544
I'm sensing some tension.
No, no, no.

09:23.611 --> 09:24.778
This is your house,

09:24.846 --> 09:27.298
and you're supposed to be
comfortable here.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.533
So, just hang out.

09:29.601 --> 09:30.768
Have more wine.

09:30.835 --> 09:32.687
And don't worry
about driving.

09:32.755 --> 09:34.722
You can spend the night
here tonight.

09:34.789 --> 09:36.057
Are you sure, Mom?

09:36.124 --> 09:37.091
Yeah, I'm sure.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.092
I'll go get some more wine.

09:40.378 --> 09:42.213
Any tips
on how she moves?

09:42.281 --> 09:43.764
I've never seen
anything like it.

09:43.832 --> 09:44.798
Right?

09:46.001 --> 09:47.018
Hello, Shane.

09:47.085 --> 09:48.653
Acting Vice Principal
Tucker.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.387
I know you think
you're pretty cute right now,

09:50.455 --> 09:51.806
but before this day
is done,

09:51.857 --> 09:54.909
I will get you to admit
you sent out that video.

09:54.976 --> 09:56.360
I did send out that video.

09:56.428 --> 09:57.695
I knew you'd crack.

09:57.762 --> 09:59.496
Look, uh...

09:59.564 --> 10:00.597
I'm sorry.

10:00.665 --> 10:02.583
I just really need these kids
to accept me.

10:02.650 --> 10:03.484
No, Shane, you don't.

10:03.551 --> 10:04.785
Because they're popular,

10:04.853 --> 10:06.453
you think you need
their approval.

10:08.373 --> 10:09.740
I'm a cop.

10:09.808 --> 10:11.225
Oh, are you, now?

10:11.293 --> 10:12.393
There's concern

10:12.460 --> 10:14.078
about some drug traffic
at this school.

10:14.146 --> 10:16.297
I am here, undercover,
to shut it down.

10:16.365 --> 10:20.101
Okay, yeah.

10:20.168 --> 10:22.069
Okay,
well, I kind of always
knew you were police.

10:22.137 --> 10:23.321
Well, sure.

10:23.388 --> 10:24.838
You're law enforcement,
too.

10:24.906 --> 10:25.973
We know our own.

10:26.041 --> 10:27.575
Cop eyes.

10:27.643 --> 10:29.476
Cop eyes.

10:29.544 --> 10:30.327
Okay.

10:30.395 --> 10:31.629
So what's the play?

10:31.697 --> 10:33.681
There's this new designer drug
alled Dexomorphone.

10:33.749 --> 10:35.500
Mm-hmm.
Kids are calling them
"Dum-Dums."

10:35.567 --> 10:37.618
So there's this big deal
going down tonight

10:37.686 --> 10:39.686
on the north campus
during the basketball game.

10:39.754 --> 10:41.054
And you want my help
with the bust.

10:41.122 --> 10:42.439
Yes.

10:42.507 --> 10:44.358
By being
nowhere near there.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.760
I don't want to spook
these dealers.

10:45.828 --> 10:46.761
Copy that.

10:46.829 --> 10:48.012
But in case
you need backup,

10:48.080 --> 10:50.064
I should be
near north campus.

10:50.132 --> 10:52.099
Or nowhere near there.

10:52.167 --> 10:54.585
Or there...

10:54.653 --> 10:57.638
but slouched down in my car
so no one sees me.

10:57.706 --> 10:58.939
Or at your house.

10:59.007 --> 11:00.858
Right.

11:00.925 --> 11:02.259
Okay.

11:02.327 --> 11:03.411
Cop eyes.

11:05.079 --> 11:07.264
Okay. Okay.

11:07.332 --> 11:08.432
Are we gonna go outside?

11:08.500 --> 11:09.683
Yes, we are.

11:09.751 --> 11:11.118
Careful.

11:11.186 --> 11:11.969
How many times have
I told you

11:12.036 --> 11:13.187
not to leave this here?

11:13.255 --> 11:14.422
Someone's gonna trip on it.

11:14.490 --> 11:15.856
There's a lot going on
with me right now.

11:15.924 --> 11:16.958
My body's changing.

11:17.025 --> 11:18.526
Okay.
You always use that.

11:18.594 --> 11:21.094
Hey, today, you're gonna
learn about responsibility.

11:21.162 --> 11:23.797
Today, you are gonna
take care of a baby.

11:23.865 --> 11:26.250
Do you want a toy?

11:26.318 --> 11:28.252
Little tough love.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.587
Long overdo,
if you ask me.

11:30.655 --> 11:32.239
But it's gonna be good
for you, sweetie.

11:32.307 --> 11:34.575
He's crying.

11:34.643 --> 11:36.210
Well,
that's what babies do.

11:36.278 --> 11:40.297
You just got to pick it up,
and you got to soothe it.

11:40.365 --> 11:41.982
All right, then.

11:42.050 --> 11:44.118
Okay.
It's okay.

11:44.186 --> 11:45.385
It worked.
Good.

11:45.521 --> 11:47.738
Just keep it up for
the rest of the afternoon.

11:47.856 --> 11:49.773
Wait! I don't know
what I'm supposed to do!

11:49.841 --> 11:51.775
Yeah. Well,
welcome to being a parent.

11:53.095 --> 11:55.662
Survival vlog number two.

11:55.730 --> 11:57.648
Um...I descended
into the water

11:57.716 --> 11:59.800
attempting
to retrieve my gear.

11:59.868 --> 12:01.435
I encountered
slippery rocks...

12:02.603 --> 12:04.772
...a cold, brisk current,

12:04.839 --> 12:06.807
and although I have
no photographic evidence of it,

12:06.875 --> 12:09.026
a sea serpent.

12:09.094 --> 12:12.480
My ensuing thrashing
stunned a passing trout.

12:12.548 --> 12:16.650
I then foraged some
wild blueberries and honey

12:16.718 --> 12:19.720
from what turned out to be
a not -- --

12:19.805 --> 12:23.123
altogether abandoned hive.

12:23.191 --> 12:26.260
Just goes to show you...

12:26.328 --> 12:28.762
I don't need
all that fancy equipment.

12:28.830 --> 12:31.749
Phil Dunphy can survive
in the wild, even --

12:36.238 --> 12:37.505
Ha! Ha!

12:37.573 --> 12:39.740
That sounded big, didn't it?

12:39.807 --> 12:42.376
Good thing I smell like
berries, honey, and raw fish,

12:42.444 --> 12:43.727
so I'm basically
all three courses

12:43.795 --> 12:44.946
of a bear's favorite meal!

12:51.469 --> 12:53.471
That's right.

12:53.539 --> 12:55.672
Watch them scatter.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.725
Hello?
Oh, hi, honey!

12:57.792 --> 12:59.343
I've been out of cell range
for most of the day.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.161
I just wanted to check in,
see how you're doing.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.148
Oh. Great, great.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.899
The air, the, uh --
the trees...

13:05.967 --> 13:08.218
Moss only grows on
the north side
of trees, right?

13:08.270 --> 13:11.071
I feel like I might be
walking in circles.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.757
Is there something called, uh,
fool's moss?

13:13.825 --> 13:14.658
I don't know.

13:14.726 --> 13:16.561
You sound out of breath.
Is everything okay?

13:16.612 --> 13:19.012
No, Claire,
I'm worried that a bear

13:19.080 --> 13:21.865
or even a family of bears
is hunting me.

13:21.933 --> 13:23.334
Of course I'm okay.

13:23.401 --> 13:24.785
I've only been out here
for a couple hours.

13:24.853 --> 13:26.804
Uh, uh, what kind of man
do you think I am?

13:26.922 --> 13:29.240
Well, it sounds like
we're both having
an adventure.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.642
I just got on a scale,
and guess how much I weigh.

13:31.709 --> 13:33.177
5 tons!

13:33.245 --> 13:34.161
Yeah, well,
we all put on a few

13:34.296 --> 13:35.696
around the holidays.

13:35.764 --> 13:37.864
Mwah! Let me call you back
a little later.

13:37.932 --> 13:40.200
Meanwhile, uh,
I am sending you a pic

13:40.268 --> 13:43.120
of me enjoying nature
at my last known location

13:43.188 --> 13:45.356
in my very identifiable
red Gore-Tex jacket.

13:45.423 --> 13:47.674
Anyhoo, leave a check out
for the gardener,

13:47.742 --> 13:48.943
and you gave
my life meaning.

13:51.980 --> 13:53.731
You're a giggly one,
aren't ya?

13:53.798 --> 13:55.032
Oh, I miss that sound.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.400
Hi. Can I look?

13:56.468 --> 13:58.636
Hey, Lily,
how's it going?

13:58.704 --> 13:59.586
I'm trying my best,

13:59.654 --> 14:01.321
but I don't really know
what I'm doing.

14:01.323 --> 14:02.657
Well, better to make
your mistakes on this one.

14:02.724 --> 14:03.723
You know?

14:03.791 --> 14:05.609
Oh, hold on one second.

14:05.677 --> 14:06.994
Oh, someone's sending me
a video of daddy.

14:07.062 --> 14:08.329
Hey! It must be 5:00...

14:08.396 --> 14:10.381
No, not the Weasel.
Okay.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.500
Honey, I got to call you back,
all right?
Wait!

14:12.567 --> 14:14.084
God, he must be
so humiliated.

14:14.152 --> 14:15.586
You know he's a doll.

14:15.653 --> 14:16.987
Thank you.
Thank you. That's sweet.

14:17.055 --> 14:18.139
Thank you.

14:18.206 --> 14:19.473
Mitchell.

14:19.541 --> 14:20.925
Cam.
Hey, hey, hey!

14:20.993 --> 14:22.893
I saw that video
that's going around.

14:22.961 --> 14:25.279
I am so sorry.
Oh, doesn't bother me.

14:25.297 --> 14:25.980
Good!

14:26.047 --> 14:27.381
Good, 'cause it shouldn't,
you know?

14:27.449 --> 14:28.582
You're just trying
to make a difference.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.784
If those kids
don't appreciate that,

14:29.851 --> 14:31.185
that is their loss.

14:31.253 --> 14:32.269
Yeah. And...
Mm-hmm.

14:32.336 --> 14:35.723
...it's part of a big
sting operation.
What?

14:35.791 --> 14:37.074
So, I shouldn't
be telling you this,

14:37.142 --> 14:40.444
but Shane,
the guy who shot the video,

14:40.511 --> 14:43.731
is actually
an undercover cop.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.366
Oh.
Yeah,
and he did the video

14:45.434 --> 14:46.951
to sort of, like,
humiliate me

14:47.018 --> 14:48.535
to get some street cred.

14:48.603 --> 14:51.922
And there's a big drug deal
going on tonight,

14:51.990 --> 14:53.774
but he wants me
to steer clear.

14:53.825 --> 14:54.742
Is anyone else aware of

14:54.876 --> 14:56.543
Shane's "21 Jump Street"
double life?

14:56.611 --> 14:58.829
Well, he's not gonna
broadcast it

14:58.831 --> 15:00.497
out loud for everyone.

15:00.565 --> 15:03.150
But you did get some paperwork
or identification?

15:03.217 --> 15:04.234
Okay. You know what?

15:04.302 --> 15:05.686
I think it's hilarious that

15:05.753 --> 15:07.938
the person you don't trust
is a hero,

15:08.006 --> 15:09.590
who's helping fight
the Dexomorphone problem

15:09.658 --> 15:11.174
that's plaguing --
I'm sorry. What?

15:11.242 --> 15:12.927
The street name
is "Dum-Dums,"

15:12.994 --> 15:15.629
and Shane says
there's literally
Dum-Dums everywhere.

15:15.697 --> 15:18.232
Okay. So, Shane --

15:18.299 --> 15:21.319
not a 16-year-old drug dealer
who enjoys humiliating you,

15:21.386 --> 15:23.036
but a baby-faced
police officer --

15:23.121 --> 15:25.405
has deputized you,
and your first assignment

15:25.490 --> 15:27.241
is to stay
as far away as possible

15:27.309 --> 15:30.610
from a huge "Dum-Dum" deal
that's about to go down?

15:30.678 --> 15:32.913
Cam, I mean, come -- I love
how trusting you are,

15:32.980 --> 15:34.381
but when you start
missing things

15:34.448 --> 15:36.717
that are that obvious,
then, well, you know,

15:36.802 --> 15:38.569
I don't have to
say anything more.

15:40.221 --> 15:41.255
You know,
I can finish up here

15:41.322 --> 15:42.572
if you want to go upstairs.

15:42.640 --> 15:46.160
Nah, nah, I'm fine.

15:46.228 --> 15:47.978
You know, um...

15:48.045 --> 15:50.664
Mom really
surprised me before.

15:50.732 --> 15:51.932
This is the first time

15:52.000 --> 15:53.651
she's treating me
like an adult.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.018
And Karen's great.

15:55.086 --> 15:57.288
I mean, It's nice to be
with a mature woman,

15:57.355 --> 15:58.655
someone with experience.

15:58.723 --> 16:00.908
So you two haven't
slept together, huh?

16:03.377 --> 16:04.678
She suggested
we come here.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.430
I said fine.

16:06.498 --> 16:09.015
You don't know
how relieved I was
you guys were home.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.617
But then Mom
was so cool with it.

16:10.702 --> 16:12.269
I mean,
where's the crazy Colombian

16:12.337 --> 16:13.554
the one time I need her?

16:13.622 --> 16:14.671
This is dry.

16:17.625 --> 16:18.992
But you like Karen, right?

16:19.060 --> 16:21.812
A lot, but, I mean...

16:21.880 --> 16:23.347
bad enough she's older
than I am,

16:23.415 --> 16:24.915
she's also
a movement professor.

16:24.983 --> 16:26.033
I swear to God,
before today,

16:26.101 --> 16:27.133
I'd never heard
those two words together.

16:27.201 --> 16:28.552
Now it's all I hear.

16:30.004 --> 16:31.689
Look...

16:31.757 --> 16:34.374
it's normal to be nervous.

16:34.442 --> 16:36.109
Don't do anything
you're not ready for.

16:36.177 --> 16:38.812
Talk to her about
what you're feeling.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.515
You'll be surprised
how much easier things get

16:41.583 --> 16:44.835
after one
honest conversation.

16:46.387 --> 16:47.821
Thanks, Jay.

16:49.524 --> 16:50.724
One down, one to go.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.792
Joe?!
You ready to talk?

16:52.860 --> 16:54.945
For oatmeal raisin?

16:54.996 --> 16:57.380
Don't waste my time.

16:57.448 --> 16:59.049
Is this stuff
any good?

16:59.117 --> 17:00.634
It better be.

17:00.701 --> 17:01.935
I laid out half
my bar mitzvah bonds to get it.

17:02.003 --> 17:03.954
Sick movie of Coach Tucker,
by the way.

17:05.056 --> 17:06.707
Glad you enjoyed the film,
boys.

17:06.773 --> 17:08.291
Now you can be
in one of your own!

17:08.358 --> 17:09.260
What the hell
are you doing?!

17:09.327 --> 17:10.492
My job.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.378
I guess I really am
a vice principal.

17:12.446 --> 17:13.964
A Miami
vice principal --

17:14.031 --> 17:16.016
No, I guess it doesn't really
need the "Miami," does it.

17:16.083 --> 17:17.351
I can't believe this.

17:17.417 --> 17:19.002
You're busted.
What do we got here?

17:19.069 --> 17:21.188
Oh, let me guess --
your -- your drug money,

17:21.255 --> 17:22.422
walkie-talkie.

17:22.490 --> 17:23.557
What's this?

17:23.625 --> 17:24.907
A badge.

17:26.361 --> 17:27.611
Wow.

17:27.679 --> 17:29.063
Mitchell's really
gonna owe you an apology.

17:29.130 --> 17:30.081
Mm.

17:35.787 --> 17:37.972
Drive strong, brother.

17:42.210 --> 17:43.377
Hey, Claire.

17:43.445 --> 17:45.045
Hi, honey.
How's it going?

17:45.130 --> 17:47.531
Just sitting here by
a perfect mountain stream.

17:47.599 --> 17:50.634
Nothing beats the raw beauty
of the great outdoors.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.052
How's everything
going there?

17:52.119 --> 17:53.787
Couldn't be better.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.557
I'm on my way home now,
but we were down a driver,

17:56.625 --> 17:58.558
so I got to drive
a truck today,

17:58.626 --> 17:59.976
and I'm loving it.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.462
Makes me feel like
a real man.

18:02.530 --> 18:05.098
Yeah?
What's that feel like?

18:05.166 --> 18:06.466
Something going on
with you?

18:07.719 --> 18:13.490
Honey, I haven't been, uh,
totally honest with you.

18:13.558 --> 18:16.376
I didn't quit
Woosnam, Keneally & Dunphy.

18:16.461 --> 18:19.095
They --
They asked me to leave.

18:19.163 --> 18:21.314
Oh, honey.
What happened?

18:21.382 --> 18:23.033
Well, you know,

18:23.100 --> 18:24.952
those guys have always been
super aggressive,

18:25.019 --> 18:26.086
and they didn't feel like

18:26.154 --> 18:27.420
I have
the same killer instinct

18:27.539 --> 18:31.959
that -- that they do.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.610
Maybe they're right.

18:33.678 --> 18:36.380
Is that what this whole
crazy camping thing is about?

18:36.447 --> 18:38.115
Proving how tough
you are?

18:38.183 --> 18:39.366
Maybe, a little,

18:39.434 --> 18:41.852
especially since
I'll be going out on my own.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.571
Phil, this is a huge thing
you've been going through.

18:44.639 --> 18:46.607
Why didn't
you say something?

18:46.674 --> 18:48.859
Well,
you've had such a busy week.

18:48.927 --> 18:51.294
I don't want to be
another fire
you had to put out.

18:51.362 --> 18:52.863
Okay, listen to me.

18:52.930 --> 18:56.717
Remember how terrified I was
when I took over for my dad?

18:56.785 --> 18:59.185
The night before my first day
in the big office,

18:59.253 --> 19:00.904
I was up, heart pounding,

19:00.972 --> 19:03.674
pacing a hole
in the living-room floor.

19:03.741 --> 19:06.043
And suddenly,
you were there.

19:06.111 --> 19:07.728
You just
put your arms around me,

19:07.795 --> 19:09.213
and it made me realize

19:09.280 --> 19:11.197
I'm not going through this
alone.

19:13.834 --> 19:15.352
So forget
your idiot partners

19:15.420 --> 19:17.421
and whatever it is
you're trying to prove

19:17.489 --> 19:19.055
with this stupid
camping trip.

19:19.140 --> 19:22.659
You're great at what you do,
and also...

19:23.578 --> 19:25.029
What?

19:25.096 --> 19:26.497
How -- How --

19:26.565 --> 19:27.698
I'm gonna hang up now.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.032
I love you.
Goodbye.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.952
You didn't sound so good
on the phone.

19:33.020 --> 19:34.220
I called the hotel,

19:34.288 --> 19:36.556
and they said
you checked in early.

19:36.624 --> 19:38.275
Honey,
I know I like to complain

19:38.343 --> 19:40.744
about people coming to me
to solve their problems,

19:40.811 --> 19:43.547
but don't you dare
not come to me with yours.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.048
By the way,
if you don't want people

19:45.116 --> 19:46.666
to come to you to solve
their problems all the time,

19:46.751 --> 19:48.067
maybe don't be
so good at it.

19:49.153 --> 19:51.104
Mm.
Mm.

19:51.172 --> 19:54.091
Mm.
Well...

19:54.159 --> 19:56.843
Now that you're
so into the wild...

19:56.911 --> 20:00.046
I like
where this is going.

20:00.114 --> 20:01.181
Rawr!

20:01.248 --> 20:02.966
Don't...do that,
please.

20:06.587 --> 20:07.605
You okay?

20:09.240 --> 20:11.208
Joe is sleeping
in a fort downstairs,

20:11.275 --> 20:14.878
and Manny's upstairs
sleeping with a doctor.

20:14.945 --> 20:17.381
I don't know
what the rules are anymore.
No one does,

20:17.449 --> 20:18.449
but for what it's worth,

20:18.516 --> 20:19.700
I think
you made the right call.

20:19.767 --> 20:22.569
I am at least winning
one of these fights.

20:22.636 --> 20:25.072
Storming the fort?

20:25.139 --> 20:27.006
I'm gonna go
and drag him out of there

20:27.074 --> 20:28.692
and put him in his bed.

20:28.759 --> 20:30.377
I'm still
bigger than Joe,

20:30.445 --> 20:32.880
even though that Manny's,
like...

20:34.098 --> 20:35.849
Trust me.

20:35.917 --> 20:39.152
The little boy in Manny
isn't gone yet.

20:54.319 --> 20:56.103
Finally!
Where have you been?

20:56.171 --> 20:57.654
I have been out
walking Cal.

20:57.722 --> 20:59.473
And guess
who's right behind me.

20:59.541 --> 21:00.473
Actually,
I've been the one who --

21:00.541 --> 21:01.742
Who will be
going to Disneyland

21:01.809 --> 21:03.209
if she plays
her cards right.

21:03.277 --> 21:04.962
Now where's
my little angel?

21:05.029 --> 21:07.247
Oh, hey, tell me about
your rubdown, huh?

21:07.314 --> 21:08.565
Oh!
Oh. Oh, boy.

21:08.632 --> 21:10.434
Oh, I can get it.

21:10.501 --> 21:11.718
Now I'm so free and loose,

21:11.803 --> 21:13.987
I can pick up anything,
move around.

21:14.055 --> 21:15.605
Yep, I'm like an owl.

21:15.673 --> 21:17.457
Aww, there's
my little angel!

21:17.525 --> 21:18.976
Mm-hmm.
You know what?

21:19.043 --> 21:20.093
Thanks for this.
No problem.

21:20.178 --> 21:21.345
Let me treat you
to a bite.
Oh.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.363
Come on.
Lily, we'll be right back.

21:23.431 --> 21:25.348
How was he?
So quiet, so easy.
