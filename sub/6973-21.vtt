Anson? Anson?
Where are you, Anson?

00:10.343 --> 00:12.971
Anson. Come back, Anson.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.810
Anson. Calling Anson.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.816
Where are you, Anson?

00:19.419 --> 00:22.047
Anson.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.352
Anson. Calling Anson.

00:24.424 --> 00:26.358
Where are you, Anson?

00:28.294 --> 00:30.558
Anson.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.564
Where are you, Anson?

00:34.801 --> 00:36.735
[Tires Screech]

00:42.175 --> 00:44.973
Anson, get out here!

00:54.287 --> 00:56.778
I've warned you
about your attitude.

00:56.856 --> 00:58.790
You clean out 407?

00:58.858 --> 01:01.520
No, of course you haven't
cleaned out 407.

01:01.594 --> 01:04.084
You've only had
all damn morning.

01:04.164 --> 01:07.361
You think you're ever going to own any
of those boats the way you're going?

01:07.434 --> 01:09.994
You think you're ever
going to amount to anything?

01:10.070 --> 01:13.301
You can't even finish
a simple job.

01:13.373 --> 01:16.001
[Chuckles] A monkey could
do this job, all right, Jay?

01:16.076 --> 01:19.136
Well, you can't.
So what's that say about you?

01:19.212 --> 01:22.113
- Shut up.
- Excuse me?

01:22.182 --> 01:24.810
I didn't catch that.

01:24.884 --> 01:29.651
You clean out 407, you move out that
deadbeat's stuff, and you do it now.

01:29.722 --> 01:32.816
And when I come back in an hour,
it better be done.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.191

02:56.209 --> 02:58.769
Anson!

02:58.845 --> 03:00.779
Anson?

03:07.287 --> 03:10.745
- [Sets Parking Brake]
- Son of a...

03:15.562 --> 03:17.496
Anson.

03:19.065 --> 03:20.999
Anson!

03:22.402 --> 03:24.802
Oh, that's it, Anson.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.032
You hear me, Ans...
[Grunts]

03:29.442 --> 03:32.377
[Muffled Whimpering]

04:17.855 --> 04:20.084
Can I get you some coffee?

Water? Anything?

04:23.094 --> 04:24.959
[Door Opens]

04:25.029 --> 04:27.156
Good morning.

04:27.231 --> 04:30.496
- Good morning.
- [Mouthing Words]

04:32.436 --> 04:36.236
Special Agent Dana Scully,
this is, uh, Jay Gilmore.

04:37.642 --> 04:40.736
How...
Nice to meet you.

04:40.811 --> 04:44.008
Nice to meet...
Likewise.

04:46.083 --> 04:49.985
Mr. Gilmore came all the way to see us
from Missouri, the "Show Me" State.

04:50.054 --> 04:55.219
They told me you were the people to
best understand my sit... my sit...

04:55.293 --> 05:01.163
It's okay. Uh, this is
Mr. Gilmore's situation.

05:01.232 --> 05:03.826
This condition came on
very suddenly about a month ago.

05:03.901 --> 05:06.927
Anson Stokes,
he did this to me.

05:07.004 --> 05:10.701
I don't know how.
I just... I know it was him.

05:10.775 --> 05:13.608
Anson Stokes
is a former employee...

05:13.678 --> 05:16.977
at the self-storage yard
that Mr. Gilmore owns.

05:17.048 --> 05:19.243
Apparently there was some
bad blood between you two.

05:19.317 --> 05:22.013
He told me to shut up!
Huh?

05:22.086 --> 05:27.956
Yeah. And then Mr. Gilmore
was, uh, stricken...

05:28.025 --> 05:29.754
- stricken... stricken.
- Uh-huh.

05:29.827 --> 05:32.022
And Anson Stokes
was nowhere to be found.

05:32.096 --> 05:36.533
He resurfaced several days
later, and the police wanted
to question him, but he refused.

05:36.601 --> 05:40.264
Do you know what he said?
He said they had nothing on him.

05:40.338 --> 05:44.035
Well, and to be fair, sir,
they didn't. They don't.

05:44.108 --> 05:47.339
They had to make me
a whole new mouth.

05:47.411 --> 05:50.869
Do you think Blue Cross
is going to pay for this? Uh-uh.

05:50.948 --> 05:53.143
I demand justice!

05:53.217 --> 05:55.151
Ow.

06:04.795 --> 06:06.786
- Mulder, all I'm saying is that...
- I know.

06:06.864 --> 06:10.391
This may not be a crime, and this guy
Stokes may not know anything about it.

06:10.468 --> 06:14.063
Look, there is a condition
called microstomia... small mouth...

06:14.138 --> 06:17.505
which is brought on
by the disease scleroderma.

06:17.575 --> 06:19.509
It's the overproduction
of collagen.

06:19.577 --> 06:23.104
It can actually reduce a person's mouth
to a tiny little opening.

06:23.180 --> 06:25.114
But that takes months
to develop, right?

06:25.182 --> 06:28.948
It doesn't just happen in the blink of
an eye. Gilmore's surgeons are stumped.

06:29.020 --> 06:31.284
They're writing it up in
the New England Journal of Medicine.

06:31.355 --> 06:34.791
There's always nasal aplasia,
the complete absence of the nose.

06:34.859 --> 06:37.259
That's a nose, Scully.
We're talking mouth here.

06:37.328 --> 06:40.491
But what we're talking is medical,
physiological, not criminal.

06:40.564 --> 06:42.964
- Not as far as I can see.
- Maybe, but I still want to know...

06:43.034 --> 06:47.835
- why Anson Stokes doesn't want
to talk to the police.
- Mulder.

06:56.847 --> 07:01.147
That's a little... out of place,
wouldn't you say?

07:01.218 --> 07:03.209
A little bit.

07:04.555 --> 07:06.716
[Anson]
Ah, damn it.

07:06.791 --> 07:10.454
- Leslie!
- What? What is it?

07:10.528 --> 07:15.056
I.R.S. Agents. Gotta be.
Get rid of them, all right?

07:30.414 --> 07:33.815
Hi. We're looking
for a Mr. Anson Stokes.

07:33.884 --> 07:35.715
He's not here.

07:35.786 --> 07:37.811
Would you happen to know
when he's coming back?

07:40.358 --> 07:44.089
Well, we are Agents Mulder
and Scully from the F.B.I.

07:44.161 --> 07:46.925
The boat's... The boat's not ours.
[Stammering]

07:46.997 --> 07:50.763
We're holding it for someone, and,
you know, th-they pay the taxes on it.

07:50.835 --> 07:53.395
Okay.

07:53.471 --> 07:55.939
Anson's not here.

07:56.006 --> 07:58.668
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's your name?

07:58.743 --> 08:01.940
- Leslie Stokes.
- Oh, you're Anson's brother?

08:02.012 --> 08:04.947
[Rattling]

08:09.754 --> 08:12.450
Hi there.

08:14.191 --> 08:17.058
We're not here to
talk about the boat, Leslie.

08:17.128 --> 08:21.462
We want to talk to your brother
about his former employer, Mr. Gilmore.

08:21.532 --> 08:25.696
And the, uh, unfortunate condition
that he's found himself in.

08:25.770 --> 08:28.637
- Would you happen
to know anything about that?
- The mouth thing?

08:28.706 --> 08:31.573
Well, yeah, you know,
that's just, uh...

08:31.642 --> 08:33.905
That's, like, chemicals.

08:33.977 --> 08:36.275
"Chemicals"?

08:36.347 --> 08:39.111
Well, yeah, you know, like people
store weird chemicals, like...

08:39.183 --> 08:41.207
Like my brother, one time
he smelled this weird smell.

08:41.284 --> 08:43.253
You know, it was just a guy
with a meth lab,

08:43.320 --> 08:45.254
you know, like in one
of the storage units.

08:45.322 --> 08:47.722
That's probably something
you guys should look into.

08:47.792 --> 08:50.090
I'm gonna get going.
So I'm gonna go. Okay.

08:51.829 --> 08:53.820
Okay.

08:53.898 --> 08:56.560
Now I see what's
going on here.

09:04.842 --> 09:08.175
According to Gilmore, he was standing
right where I am when it happened.

09:09.647 --> 09:13.208
Well, I don't smell
any weird chemical smells.

09:13.284 --> 09:15.684
You still have
both your lips.

09:15.753 --> 09:17.914
Apparently everything
is left as it was.

09:24.361 --> 09:27.990
Hey. 1978.

09:28.065 --> 09:31.865
It's been a long time since any of
this stuff has seen the light of day.

09:31.936 --> 09:34.370
That's too bad, Mulder.
Underneath all this dust,

09:34.438 --> 09:36.770
this furniture
is really wonderful.

09:36.841 --> 09:39.469
Oh, well, you want to hit
some yard sales while we're out here?

09:39.543 --> 09:44.776
Mulder, this furniture is expensive.
Very expensive.

09:44.849 --> 09:47.875
- What's your point?
- My point is that...

09:47.952 --> 09:51.186
there's a lot of money sitting around
here, and maybe something's missing.

09:51.319 --> 09:54.311
- Like what?
- I don't know. Jewelry.

09:54.389 --> 09:57.290
Anson Stokes opened up the storage unit,
and then he just disappeared.

09:57.358 --> 10:01.192
- Winds up with the Titanic
in his driveway.
- Mm-hmm.

10:01.262 --> 10:03.958
There's your crime...
theft.

10:04.032 --> 10:06.398
Still doesn't explain
what happened to Gilmore.

10:07.569 --> 10:10.367
Hey, Scully,
check this out.

10:13.741 --> 10:17.074
- Ouch.
- This woman look familiar to you?

10:17.145 --> 10:21.707
- That's the woman from the trailer.
- It's the young woman from the trailer.

10:21.783 --> 10:24.775
How many centuries now
has disco been dead?

10:28.289 --> 10:33.659
Two down. Two down,
I got nothing to show for it.

10:33.728 --> 10:35.662
You got the boat.

10:35.730 --> 10:38.824
And what the hell
good is that? Huh?

10:38.900 --> 10:41.664
That thing is like a big...
You know, a big...

10:41.736 --> 10:46.173
- White elephant?
- What? I'm sorry. What does that mean?

10:46.241 --> 10:50.905
It's a big expensive item
that serves no purpose and is
more trouble than it's worth.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.614
So what the hell
did you give it to me for?

10:54.682 --> 10:58.778
- Because you asked for it.
- All right. I can appreciate that.

10:58.853 --> 11:02.755
But don't you think maybe you could've
found some fricking water to put it in?

11:02.824 --> 11:06.783
- You didn't specify water.
- I gotta specify that you
put a boat in the water?

11:06.861 --> 11:11.889
That is a given.
Fricking white elephant.

11:11.966 --> 11:14.662
I can't even pay
the taxes on it.

11:14.736 --> 11:18.331
Why don't you just use your last wish
to get rid of it?

11:18.406 --> 11:20.636
You want me to put you
in a home or something maybe?

11:20.708 --> 11:24.576
Because I just told you, Leslie,
that I wasted two wishes, okay?

11:24.646 --> 11:29.106
Are you listening? I am not gonna
waste the third, all right? Come on.

11:30.618 --> 11:35.078
Come on! I gotta concentrate here.
Let me figure this out.

11:35.156 --> 11:38.614
Third wish, third wish. Final wish.
I'm just spitballing here.

11:38.693 --> 11:40.957
If I happen to say "I wish"
by accident, that does not count.

11:41.029 --> 11:43.964
Not until I am
absolutely ready, okay?

11:44.032 --> 11:46.626
You could always give that guy
his mouth back.

11:46.701 --> 11:49.295
All I said is that I wish
Jay would shut the hell up.

11:49.370 --> 11:54.398
If you feel bad about what you did
to him, fix it on your own dime, okay?

11:54.475 --> 11:56.943
- It doesn't work like that.
- Whatever.

11:57.011 --> 12:01.812
- Leslie, would you help me out here?
- Um, money.

12:01.883 --> 12:03.748
- Yeah. Okay, that's not bad.
- Wish for money.

12:03.818 --> 12:06.685
But don't you think we should
think of something that would...

12:06.754 --> 12:09.279
generate money instead of
the actual money itself?

12:09.357 --> 12:11.689
Brains? Talent?
Hard work?

12:13.294 --> 12:16.991
Uhhh, a money machine.

12:17.065 --> 12:19.363
Okay, that's not...
But something better. Something better.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.425
Okay. But I just...

12:21.502 --> 12:26.337
- An infinite number of wishes.
- Okay!

12:26.407 --> 12:29.808
Just three, boys.
Settle down.

12:29.877 --> 12:32.539
Damn it, this is hard!

12:32.613 --> 12:35.013
You know,
I have a thought.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.950
- Granted it's pretty obvious.
- What, what, what, what, what?

12:41.422 --> 12:43.356
- What?
- What?

12:48.730 --> 12:52.166
- Seriously, what?
- Oh, forget it!

12:56.337 --> 12:58.897
- I got it. I got it.
- Yeah?

12:58.973 --> 13:02.568
I got it, I got it, I got it. Okay,
are you ready? Because I am ready.

13:02.643 --> 13:04.702
I am absolutely ready.
Okay, here it goes.

13:04.779 --> 13:09.842
I wish that I could
turn invisible... at will.

13:09.917 --> 13:13.683
- You're kidding.
- No, no, this is perfect.

13:13.755 --> 13:16.485
Yeah, I can have an advantage
that nobody else on Earth can have.

13:16.557 --> 13:22.359
I can, um, you know, spy and learn
secret information. Pick up stock tips.

13:22.430 --> 13:24.898
- Sneak into a women's locker room?
- Not just that, okay?

13:24.966 --> 13:28.697
I'm talking about
James Bond-type stuff, you know?

13:28.770 --> 13:31.933
Your wish is breathtaking
in its unoriginality.

13:32.006 --> 13:36.067
You don't have to like it, all right?
You just have to do it, right?

13:39.280 --> 13:41.214
Done.

13:44.252 --> 13:49.019
- My... clothes are gonna
turn invisible too, right?
- You didn't specify clothes.

13:49.090 --> 13:51.024
Son of a...

13:52.493 --> 13:55.189
Screw it!

14:03.037 --> 14:06.564
Oh, God.
Turn invisible, please.

14:11.879 --> 14:13.813
[Whooping]
Yes.

14:13.881 --> 14:16.941
Oh, man, this is awesome.
Hey, hey, hey, brother.

14:17.018 --> 14:19.486
Hey, Leslie, I'm over here.
I'm over here.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.488
[Laughs]
Can you see me?

14:21.556 --> 14:24.491
[Whooping, Laughing]

14:26.494 --> 14:30.225
Whoa. Aah.
Damn it.

14:30.298 --> 14:33.631
- Anson, are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fne.

14:33.701 --> 14:35.726
I can't see my damn feet.
[Laughing]

14:35.803 --> 14:39.136
Look out, world,
here I come.

14:39.207 --> 14:41.573
[Whooping, Laughing]

14:41.642 --> 14:45.476
I'm invisible.
Invisible, baby. Whoo.

14:45.546 --> 14:48.174
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yes.

14:48.249 --> 14:50.547
You can't see me,
can you?

14:50.618 --> 14:53.587
- L... Whoo!

Oh. Well, hello, ladies.

15:18.779 --> 15:21.907
Here comes Anson.
That's right.

15:21.983 --> 15:24.178
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Change, change.

15:24.252 --> 15:26.948
All right. Here we go.

15:27.021 --> 15:31.390
Need a little roadside assistance,
do you? [Laughs]

15:31.459 --> 15:34.155
Not to worry.
Here comes Anson.

I think you missed
a spot here.

18:12.283 --> 18:14.877
I can see straight through
to his ass.

18:17.955 --> 18:20.116
This is Anson Stokes, huh?

18:20.191 --> 18:22.216
It is.

18:22.293 --> 18:24.227
His dental records
are a match.

18:24.295 --> 18:26.229
He was found about
a half mile from his house.

18:26.297 --> 18:31.064
He was probably hit by a car
or a truck or something.

18:31.135 --> 18:33.399
And he's invisible.

18:33.471 --> 18:35.405
Yes, he is.

18:37.175 --> 18:39.200
Wow.

18:39.277 --> 18:43.373
You know, in the seven years
we've been working together,
I have seen some amazing things,

18:43.448 --> 18:47.578
but this...
this takes the cake.

18:47.652 --> 18:51.520
It's... It's gonna change
the boundaries of science.

18:51.589 --> 18:55.491
It is amazing, but I don't think
it has anything to do with science.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.529
Remember Mr. Saturday
Night Fever?

18:59.764 --> 19:02.164
- Yeah.
- I did a little background checking.

19:02.233 --> 19:04.531
His real name
is Henry Flanken.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.230
He redefined the term
"overnight success."

19:07.305 --> 19:10.672
In 1977, his net worth
was 36,000 dollars.

19:10.742 --> 19:13.836
And in 1978,
it was 30 million dollars.

19:13.911 --> 19:19.713
Then there is the interesting way
in which Mr. Flanken died.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.547
How's that?

19:21.619 --> 19:24.087
Chronic morbid tumescence.

19:25.590 --> 19:27.751
- You don't mean what I think you mean?
- Schwing!

19:27.825 --> 19:31.226
On April 4, 1978, he was admitted
to Gateway Memorial Hospital...

19:31.295 --> 19:33.456
with an extreme
priapic condition.

19:33.531 --> 19:36.295
Apparently he was
quite the specimen.

19:36.367 --> 19:40.303
They had to raise the door frame
in order to wheel him
into his hospital room.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.203
Well, what does any of that
have to do with this?

19:46.277 --> 19:48.745
Well, I think our
mystery woman is the link,

19:48.813 --> 19:52.579
about whom I can find
no information whatsoever.

19:52.650 --> 19:56.882
- I think she's responsible
for all of this.
- But how?

19:56.954 --> 19:58.979
L-I don't know,

19:59.056 --> 20:02.219
but we need to talk to her.

20:02.293 --> 20:06.957
Uh, I think I should stay here
with the body. I mean, l... You know...

20:07.031 --> 20:10.091
I don't think it's a good idea
to leave him unguarded.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.864
This is truly amazing.

20:12.937 --> 20:14.871
Okay.

20:26.883 --> 20:29.443
[Mulder]
I'm very sorry for your loss.

20:31.021 --> 20:35.082
- Anson didn't suffer, did he?
- No, I don't think he suffered.

20:36.693 --> 20:40.686
But the part about him being invisible,
that doesn't, uh,

20:40.764 --> 20:43.232
catch you off guard
just a little bit?

20:43.300 --> 20:45.768
Uh...

20:47.337 --> 20:49.703
Leslie, there was a woman here earlier.
Where is she now?

20:49.773 --> 20:53.436
She's, uh... She's gone.

20:53.510 --> 20:56.638
Let me tell you where I'm going with
this. I think that woman is a Jinniyah.

20:56.713 --> 20:59.876
- Are you familiar with that term?
- No.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.316
It's the feminine
for "genie," as in...

21:02.385 --> 21:04.979
a demon or spirit from
Middle Eastern folklore?

21:09.059 --> 21:13.052
- ## [Humming Theme From
I Dream OfJeannie]
- ## [Hums Along]

21:16.299 --> 21:20.065
Yeah, except Barbara Eden
never killed anybody.

21:20.136 --> 21:25.005
Now, in Arabic mythology,
they speak of these beings that
are composed of flame or air...

21:25.075 --> 21:27.202
but take human form.

21:27.277 --> 21:30.144
They can perform certain tasks
or grant certain wishes.

21:30.213 --> 21:34.980
They live in inanimate objects
like a lamp or a ring. Is this
beginning to sound familiar?

21:36.486 --> 21:38.954
Leslie, I believe your brother
found just such an object...

21:39.022 --> 21:41.252
in the storage facility,
didn't he?

21:41.324 --> 21:43.724
He took possession
of theJinniyah,

21:43.793 --> 21:45.852
and he made some
pretty outrageous requests,

21:45.929 --> 21:48.124
likeJay Gilmore's mouth
and that yacht out in the driveway.

21:48.198 --> 21:51.099
Wait, wait.
You believe all that?

21:51.167 --> 21:53.397
I do.

21:53.470 --> 21:55.404
And Leslie,
for your own safety,

21:55.472 --> 21:59.431
so that what happened to your brother
doesn't happen to you,

21:59.509 --> 22:01.875
I think you should hand over
that object to me right now.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.739
You're doing
the right thing.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.984
Scully, come check this out.

22:52.062 --> 22:54.428
Come on.
He's not going anywhere. Come on.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.602
Bye.

23:00.670 --> 23:04.401
I have a group of researchers
flying in from Harvard Medical.

23:04.474 --> 23:06.772
I can't wait
to see their faces.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.813
- What's this?
- It's not what I hoped it would be,

23:10.880 --> 23:12.871
judging from the odor
coming from inside.

23:12.949 --> 23:15.884
I think it's where the Stokes brothers
keep their weed.

23:15.952 --> 23:18.921
But that's not what
I wanted to show you.

23:21.091 --> 23:24.822
- Recognize him? How about her?
- Benito Mussolini.

23:30.233 --> 23:33.862
Your mystery woman
or someone who looks a lot like her.

23:33.937 --> 23:36.497
The computer says
it is her.

23:36.573 --> 23:39.633
I ran her through Quantico's
facial recognition software...

23:39.709 --> 23:41.768
and couldn't come up with a match
in the known-felon database.

23:41.845 --> 23:46.214
Then I took a flyer and checked with
the image bank at the National Archives.

23:46.282 --> 23:49.718
- Voila.
- Well, even if it is her,

23:49.786 --> 23:51.777
Mulder, what would she
be doing with Mussolini?

23:51.855 --> 23:54.722
Or Richard Nixon,
for that matter.

who got all the power they ever
wished for and then lost it.

See? I told you
it'd look good in here.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.810
Nice rug. How do you breathe
in that thing?

24:15.879 --> 24:18.040
Can we just get
this over with, please?

24:18.114 --> 24:20.844
- Three wishes. Go.
- Don't rush me, all right?
I want to do this right.

24:22.318 --> 24:26.880
I've gotta be smarter than Anson was.
Damn it, Anson.

24:26.956 --> 24:30.551
Then can I once again
offer you a suggestion?

24:30.627 --> 24:32.254
Hmm.

24:34.297 --> 24:37.232
- What?
- This!

24:37.300 --> 24:39.268
Your disability?

24:39.335 --> 24:42.532
There was some tragedy
involved here I assume.

24:42.605 --> 24:45.130
Well, yeah, it was
pretty tragic, I guess.

24:45.208 --> 24:47.733
Me and Anson were playing
mailbox baseball.

24:47.811 --> 24:50.609
God, I miss that.
And Anson's driving.

Yeah, you're right.

Man, that'd be sweet. I see what
you're saying. But you know what?

There's something I want
more than that.

You're not gonna believe
your eyes.

What did you expect?
- Yeah.

back to normal.

An invisible man?

You saw it.
It was real.

I don't know what I saw, Mulder.

I do know that having that
kind of proof in my hands,

27:17.058 --> 27:19.618
it was just too good
to be true.

27:19.694 --> 27:21.855
I don't think that's why
the body disappeared.

27:21.930 --> 27:24.091
Why did the body disappear?

27:24.165 --> 27:26.895
I think it was a result
of a wish being granted.

an explanation for...

31:26.473 --> 31:29.067
is how his corpse got
from my locked morgue...

all the way across town
to the Mark Twain Trailer Park.

Ask him.
He's got it all figured out.

31:35.983 --> 31:38.474

that you're some kind of a genie...

- An "ifrit"?

33:01.802 --> 33:05.033
A very powerful class
of genie.

33:05.105 --> 33:10.270
He offered me three wishes. For the
frst, I asked for a stouthearted mule.

33:10.344 --> 33:15.372
For the second, uh, a magic sack
that was always full of turnips.

33:15.449 --> 33:18.350
Did I mention this was
15th century France?

33:18.418 --> 33:20.386
What was your third wish?

33:20.454 --> 33:23.480
My third...
I pondered for a great while.

33:23.557 --> 33:26.117
I didn't want to waste it.

33:26.193 --> 33:29.560
So finally, feeling very intelligent,
I spoke up, and I said...

33:29.629 --> 33:33.360
[French]

33:34.768 --> 33:37.134
"I wish for great power
and long life."

33:37.204 --> 33:39.570
And thus became
a genie yourself.

33:39.639 --> 33:43.575
Gave me the mark of theJinn...
right there.

33:43.643 --> 33:47.773
It's forever.
Sort of like a prison tattoo.

33:47.848 --> 33:50.408
I should've been
more specific.

33:53.053 --> 33:55.214
So am I under arrest?

33:55.288 --> 33:59.554
I can't think of anything
we have to hold you on.

33:59.626 --> 34:01.787
Not surprisingly, we don't have
any evidence of any of this,

34:01.862 --> 34:04.888
so, uh, I think
she's free to go.

34:04.965 --> 34:08.492
No, I'm not.
He unrolled me.

34:11.871 --> 34:14.601
I get three wishes.

34:24.149 --> 34:27.846
So, your partner left
the airport rather quickly.

34:27.920 --> 34:30.786
I don't think
she likes me very much.

34:30.856 --> 34:33.949
Oh, well, I don't think she
knows what to make of you.

34:34.025 --> 34:37.359
- I don't... think I do either, really.
- [Cars Passing By]

34:37.429 --> 34:40.523
Well, you could always
give up your three wishes.

34:40.599 --> 34:43.534
I'll disappear.
No hard feelings.

34:43.601 --> 34:47.469
- I didn't think so.
So what's your first wish?
- [Horns Honking]

34:48.574 --> 34:51.202
Well... W-W...
[Laughs]

34:51.275 --> 34:53.835
What would your wish be
if-if you were in my place?

34:53.911 --> 34:56.277
I'm not you.
It doesn't matter.

34:56.348 --> 34:58.942
No, but, you know, I just...
I'd like to know.

35:02.621 --> 35:05.488
I'd...

35:05.557 --> 35:07.991
wish that I never heard
the word "wish" before.

35:08.060 --> 35:12.520
I'd wish that I could live
my life moment by moment,

35:14.500 --> 35:19.301
enjoying it for what it is
instead of...

35:19.371 --> 35:21.305
instead of worrying
about what it isn't.

35:22.908 --> 35:26.503
I'd sit down somewhere
with a great cup of coffee,

35:28.247 --> 35:30.579
and I'd watch the world go by.

35:34.386 --> 35:36.377
But then again,
I'm not you.

35:36.455 --> 35:38.480
So I doubt that's your wish.
[Clears Throat]

35:38.557 --> 35:41.287
You know, I think I'm beginning
to see the problem here.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.920
You say that most people
make the wrong wishes, right?

35:43.996 --> 35:47.056
Without fail. It's like giving
a chimpanzee a revolver.

35:47.132 --> 35:50.260
This is because they make their wishes
solely for personal gain.

35:50.335 --> 35:52.997
- Could be.
- So the trick would be...

35:53.072 --> 35:55.836
to make a wish that's totally
altruistic, that's for everyone.

35:55.908 --> 35:58.069
[Sighs]

36:00.479 --> 36:02.344
So, um,

36:06.251 --> 36:08.412
I wish for peace on Earth.

36:10.289 --> 36:12.723
Peace on Earth.
That's it?

36:15.127 --> 36:17.391
What the hell's wrong with that?
You can't do it?

36:17.463 --> 36:20.364
No. I can.

36:20.432 --> 36:22.866
- [Cars Stop, Honking Ceases]
- It's done.

36:31.009 --> 36:32.943
Oh, crap.

36:59.138 --> 37:02.232
I guess I should have
seen this coming!

37:07.346 --> 37:09.280
Scully.

37:17.289 --> 37:19.223
Scully?

37:26.231 --> 37:28.165
Hello?

37:30.369 --> 37:32.303
Hello!

37:37.910 --> 37:40.470
Very good. Genie!

37:40.546 --> 37:44.448
- Genie! Whatever the hell
your name is!
- Yes?

37:46.985 --> 37:50.819
- What the hell is this?
- It's what you asked for...
peace on Earth.

37:50.889 --> 37:53.119
[Gasps]
Listen.

37:53.192 --> 37:55.387
You know damn well
that's not what I meant.

37:55.460 --> 37:59.123
- You didn't specify.
- This has nothing to do
with specificity!

37:59.198 --> 38:03.066
You don't have to wipe out the entire
population of the whole planet...

38:03.135 --> 38:05.695
just to affect a little peace on Earth
and goodwill towards men.

38:05.771 --> 38:07.898
Mmm, you didn't say,
"Goodwill towards men."

38:09.575 --> 38:13.841
So you expect me to change the hearts
of six billion people?

38:13.912 --> 38:16.540
No religion in history's
been able to pull that off.

38:16.615 --> 38:19.209
Not Allah or Buddha
or Christ.

38:19.284 --> 38:21.275
But you'd like me to do that
in your name?

38:21.353 --> 38:25.653
So... what, you can feel
real good about yourself?

38:25.724 --> 38:29.091
D-Did I say that?
L... I didn't say that.

38:29.161 --> 38:32.597
Mmm, how grotesquely
egotistical of you.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.194
I bet you wish you
hadn't made your first wish.

38:37.269 --> 38:41.672
Yes, I do, since you butchered
the intent of that wish so completely.

38:41.740 --> 38:45.335
And another thing. I think you've got
a really horrible attitude.

38:45.410 --> 38:48.470
I guess that comes from being rolled up
in a rug for the last 500 years.

38:48.547 --> 38:52.608
But we're not all that stupid. We're
not all chimpanzees with revolvers.

38:52.684 --> 38:55.915
I think there's another
possibility here, and that's
just that you're a bitch!

38:57.923 --> 39:00.756
Agent Mulder?

39:03.996 --> 39:05.930
Sir.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.525
How did you get in here?

39:10.602 --> 39:12.471
Uh...

39:12.604 --> 39:14.401
"Whereas,
I have one wish left...

39:14.473 --> 39:16.737
and desire to use it most effectively
for the good of all mankind..."

39:16.808 --> 39:21.211
yadda, yadda, yadda...
"here on this plane of existence."

39:21.279 --> 39:24.180
Hmm.

39:24.249 --> 39:26.217
What, are you a lawyer?

39:26.284 --> 39:28.309
Well, I have to be with you.

39:28.386 --> 39:31.412
I'm gonna get this last wish perfect.
I'm not gonna leave you any loopholes.

39:31.490 --> 39:34.459
I'm not gonna let you
interpret this as an edict
to bring back the Third Reich...

39:34.526 --> 39:37.620
or to make everyone's eyes
grow on stalks.

39:37.696 --> 39:40.722
Oh, geez. And I was so
looking forward to that.

39:46.004 --> 39:47.938
[Door Opens]

39:54.179 --> 39:58.639
Skinner called me, Mulder.
Is everything all right?

39:59.885 --> 40:01.819
You don't remember
disappearing...

40:01.887 --> 40:04.515
off the face of the earth
for about an hour this morning?

40:04.589 --> 40:06.921
No.

40:06.992 --> 40:09.483
Then I guess everything's okay.

40:09.561 --> 40:11.586
[Sighs]

40:11.663 --> 40:13.597
Mul...

40:15.567 --> 40:17.501
Could you give us
a minute, please?

40:17.569 --> 40:19.503
Sure.

40:26.278 --> 40:28.212
Like today?

40:30.282 --> 40:32.216
Wh...

40:36.755 --> 40:39.349
- Where the hell'd she go?
- Boink!

40:39.424 --> 40:41.756
No. It's gotta...

40:41.826 --> 40:45.353
It's gotta be hypnotism
or mesmerism or something.

40:45.430 --> 40:48.957
Scully, it is what it is. You examined
an invisible body, remember?

40:49.034 --> 40:51.298
- I thought I did.
- Oh!

40:51.369 --> 40:53.303
[Scoffs]
Mulder, all right. Say...

40:53.371 --> 40:56.568
Say that you're right.
Say this is what it is.

40:56.641 --> 41:01.340
Then what you're doing
is extraordinarily dangerous.
You even said that yourself.

41:01.413 --> 41:05.372
No, no, the trick is to be specific,
to make the wish perfect.

41:05.450 --> 41:07.680
That way everyone
is gonna beneft.

41:07.752 --> 41:09.686
It's gonna be a safer world,
a happier world.

41:09.754 --> 41:11.949
There's gonna be food for everyone,
freedom for everyone,

41:12.023 --> 41:15.982
the end of tyranny
of the powerful over the weak.

41:16.061 --> 41:19.155
- Am I leaving anything out?
- It sounds wonderful.

41:19.230 --> 41:23.030
- Then what's the problem?
- Maybe it's the whole point...

41:23.101 --> 41:26.036
of our lives here, Mulder,
to achieve that.

41:26.104 --> 41:28.572
I mean,
maybe it's a process...

41:28.640 --> 41:32.838
that one man shouldn't try
and circumvent with a single wish.

41:51.997 --> 41:54.295
[Typing]

41:54.366 --> 41:56.300
[Jenn]
You ready?

41:58.269 --> 42:00.635
Yeah, I'm ready.

42:11.516 --> 42:14.610
[Mulder] I can't believe you
don't want butter on your popcorn.

42:14.686 --> 42:17.348
Ew. It's un-American.

42:17.422 --> 42:19.856
- Caddyshack, Mulder?
- [TV: Indistinct]

42:19.924 --> 42:22.518
- It's a classic American movie.
- [Tape Forwarding]

42:22.594 --> 42:25.859
That's what every guy says.
It's a guy movie.

42:25.930 --> 42:29.593
Okay, when you invite me over to your
place, we can watch Steel Magnolias.

42:32.203 --> 42:35.138
[Chuckling]

42:37.475 --> 42:42.310
- So, um, what's the occasion?
- [Tape Forwarding]

42:42.380 --> 42:45.372
I don't know. It just...
felt like the thing to do.

42:45.450 --> 42:48.385
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:51.890 --> 42:54.324
I don't know if you noticed,
but, um,

42:54.392 --> 42:56.485
I never made the world
a happier place.

42:59.731 --> 43:01.961
Well, I'm fairly happy.

43:02.033 --> 43:04.593
That's something.

43:04.669 --> 43:07.331
[Man On TV]
And now our feature presentation.

43:10.508 --> 43:13.238
So what was
your final wish anyway?

43:16.381 --> 43:18.281
##[TV]

43:18.349 --> 43:20.874
#I'm all right #

43:39.738 --> 43:41.672
Here you go.

44:24.415 --> 44:27.145
[Child]
I made this.
