I'm surprised you lived
through that sentence.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.165
Sorry you wasted
your life, Professor.

13:10.249 --> 13:12.459
I guess you'll never know
everything after all.

13:12.543 --> 13:13.544
Indeed.

13:13.669 --> 13:17.298
The pursuit of knowledge
is hopeless and eternal.

13:18.299 --> 13:19.508
Hooray!

14:19.485 --> 14:20.861
Team assembled!

14:20.944 --> 14:22.404
What is that box,
you old witch?

14:22.488 --> 14:23.906
Ha,ha,ha.
I'll never tell you.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.616
It's a deep space
emotion detector.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.910
(ALL GASPING)

14:27.993 --> 14:30.204
The detector can tell you're impressed.
You should be!

(ALARM SOUNDING)

14:34.500 --> 14:36.377
Wha...
The marvelous device,

14:36.460 --> 14:39.004
it's detecting a massive burst
of anger from deep space!

14:50.516 --> 14:53.977
Flying bananas? Ha, ha. I will slice
them on my morning fish porridge.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.938
This is no time for
one of your jokes, Fry.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.773
I will tell you
something that's no joke.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.149
I will lead
the defense fight.

14:59.483 --> 15:02.778
(LAUGHS) Don't make me laugh. If we
fight, we'll surely be destroyed.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.279
Then what is
our only hope?

15:04.363 --> 15:07.157
We must summon Zagtar,
defender of space!

15:07.241 --> 15:08.659
You forget.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.830
<i>Zagtar was destroyed
by the crystal space devil!</i>

15:15.165 --> 15:18.085
LEELA: <i>The crystal space devil was
once my brother Prince Hiroshi.</i>

15:18.168 --> 15:19.253
I mourn his loss,

15:19.336 --> 15:22.339
but what matters now is protecting
Earth from that fruit armada.

15:22.423 --> 15:23.590
I see your mother,
the water mutant,

15:23.674 --> 15:25.134
didn't raise any fools,
Turanga Leela.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.969
Our only hope is to
communicate with the aliens,

15:27.052 --> 15:28.595
and show them our
peaceful intentions.

15:28.679 --> 15:31.807
Perhaps they speak perfect
English, as do we. (LAUGHS)

15:31.890 --> 15:35.060
We can't take that chance. We'll
need my universal auto-translator.

15:35.144 --> 15:37.229
This is my universal
auto-translator.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.148
That will show them
our peaceful intentions.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.608
The only question is
who should be our spokesman?

15:41.692 --> 15:43.402
Me, me. Choose Zoidberg.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.862
Zoidberg a diplomat?

15:44.945 --> 15:47.448
The list of things I've heard
now contains everything.

15:47.531 --> 15:48.574
Hear my words.

15:48.657 --> 15:51.410
My shell may be tough, like
a samurai honeymoon mask,

15:51.535 --> 15:54.663
but inside I'm as soft and sensitive
as a girl made of custard.

succeed with my delicate manner.

(GROANING)

16:06.133 --> 16:07.134
Oops.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.595
Instead, I will send
the peace transmission.

16:10.929 --> 16:13.807
Most honored visitors,
we greet you in peace.

I fear our only option
is thrilling space battle.

Defeat is ours.

17:52.823 --> 17:55.617
If we can't communicate with these
bone jelly ghosts, we're doomed!

17:56.285 --> 18:00.038
Professor, I have analyzed the aliens'
movements with this movement analyzer.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.541
That device was a gift
from my ancestors. Go on.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.335
It seems their movements
are a form of language.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.170
Rather than speaking...
FARNSVVORTHI English!

18:07.254 --> 18:09.256
...like us,
they speak by dancing.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.049
Of course!
Having no mouths or ears,

18:11.133 --> 18:12.759
they could only communicate
through motions.

18:12.843 --> 18:14.011
Or perhaps by odors.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.345
That is how
you communicate.

18:15.512 --> 18:16.888
(ALL LAUGHING)

18:16.972 --> 18:20.142
Then our only hope to talk to
them is by doing a peace dance.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.060
But it will have to be
smoother and more fluid

18:22.144 --> 18:24.104
than any movement
mankind is capable of.

18:24.187 --> 18:25.856
What if we hire
a buttered geisha?

18:25.939 --> 18:28.567

ill-timed jokes, Fry?

are enemies now.

IbeHevel, the most humble
member of Action Delivery Team,

18:34.114 --> 18:35.449
could do
such a dance.

18:35.532 --> 18:38.035
(LAUGHS) Surely your
hard shell is too rigid.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.621
I call on anyone but you
to do the peace dance.

18:40.704 --> 18:41.830

18:42.122 --> 18:44.875

at Gigatron's mercy!

It's time to end this.

enjoy the ceremony of your death.

perform such intricate motions!

understand?

to arise next week at the same time.
