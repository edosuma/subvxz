WEBVTT

00:00.431 --> 00:01.465
No!

00:01.466 --> 00:02.799
<i>Previously on  sanctuary...</i>

00:02.800 --> 00:04.968
[magnus]: Wexford fired
depth charges at bertha.

00:04.969 --> 00:06.470
Ah!

00:06.471 --> 00:09.439
[magnus]: She responded by
creating a massive tidal wave.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.941
I have to try
and contact kali again.

00:10.942 --> 00:13.844
<i>Kali will appear to
a former host one final time,</i>

00:13.845 --> 00:16.079
At the gates
to the spirit realm.

00:16.079 --> 00:17.481
Spirit realm?
As in--

00:17.482 --> 00:18.415
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

00:18.416 --> 00:20.083
In order to talk to kali...

00:22.520 --> 00:25.389
...You have to die.

00:26.558 --> 00:28.492
I came to ask for your help.

00:28.493 --> 00:31.962
You wish me
to stop the waves?

00:31.963 --> 00:33.363
Fire the damn missiles!

00:33.364 --> 00:35.199
Sir, that's
a civilian ship--

00:35.200 --> 00:36.300
Do it!

00:37.335 --> 00:39.403
Now, target bertha.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:49.047 --> 00:50.147
Kali!

00:59.390 --> 01:01.825
<i>[henry]:  Will, do you copy?</i>

01:01.826 --> 01:04.861
<i>Will?</i>

01:04.861 --> 01:07.331
<i>[comm chirps]
will!</i>

01:07.332 --> 01:09.366
<i>I'm picking up movement
on the scanner.</i>

01:09.367 --> 01:11.635
<i>Do you have a visual yet?</i>

01:11.636 --> 01:13.170
<i>Dude!</i>

01:13.171 --> 01:15.405
<i>Oh, this is so not time
for a pee break!</i>

01:17.508 --> 01:19.009
Henry!

01:19.010 --> 01:20.611
Henry, contact! Henry!

01:20.612 --> 01:21.445
<i>[henry]: What?!</i>

01:50.375 --> 01:52.042
Everybody get back!

01:59.951 --> 02:01.184
Clear!

02:06.324 --> 02:08.592
Declan,
watch out!

02:12.196 --> 02:13.664
Henry, phase two!

02:21.506 --> 02:23.340
Cover!

02:30.281 --> 02:31.615
Declan!

02:39.324 --> 02:41.024
I'm all right!

02:41.025 --> 02:42.192
No, he's not.

02:46.197 --> 02:48.565
This was totally avoidable.

03:28.864 --> 03:30.264
[declan]: You can't
avoid this forever.

03:30.265 --> 03:32.133
It'll only get worse.

03:32.134 --> 03:34.802
Sure I can't get you
anything for the pain?

03:34.803 --> 03:36.237
I want to know
your plan.

03:36.238 --> 03:37.505
What makes you think
I have one?

03:37.506 --> 03:39.207
Magnus, the rumors
I'm hearing

03:39.208 --> 03:40.875
From other houses
are far from good--

03:40.876 --> 03:42.443
And he was on
the mission list

03:42.444 --> 03:43.378
Because...

03:43.379 --> 03:45.213
Henry, please, not now.

03:45.214 --> 03:46.414
Asleep on a stakeout?

03:46.415 --> 03:48.316
No heads up on the salamander?

03:48.317 --> 03:49.484
Declan's broken arm?

03:49.485 --> 03:51.119
Oh, it's
an occupational hazard.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.453
Turned out all right
in the end, didn't it?

03:52.454 --> 03:54.155
Arm!

03:54.156 --> 03:57.492
Yes, I know he's not
been himself lately,

03:57.493 --> 03:59.460
But that doesn't mean
we condemn him.

03:59.461 --> 04:00.762
Doc, I'm not mad,

04:00.763 --> 04:01.996
I just want to know
what's going on.

04:01.997 --> 04:03.297
It's been, like,
two weeks of this.

04:03.298 --> 04:04.866
Henry, mumbai was...

04:04.867 --> 04:06.034
It was a lot for anyone.

04:06.035 --> 04:08.269
I thought after
a few weeks,

04:08.270 --> 04:10.304
Putting him back in mission mode
would help him refocus.

04:10.305 --> 04:11.939
Yeah, worked like a charm.

04:11.940 --> 04:14.442
The man was taken host
by an abnormal spider.

04:14.443 --> 04:16.209
Died, and came back
from the other side.

04:16.211 --> 04:17.345
Come on, he's more
than earned

04:17.346 --> 04:18.946
A bit of leeway.

04:18.947 --> 04:20.380
I know, it's just,
it's getting worse.

04:20.382 --> 04:22.417
His temper's
all over the place.

04:22.418 --> 04:23.351
He's not sleeping.

04:23.352 --> 04:25.286
He's not talking to me or kate.

04:25.287 --> 04:26.888
The big guy's stopped
smacking him in the head.

04:26.889 --> 04:28.289
I know.

04:28.290 --> 04:29.824
What do we do?

04:29.825 --> 04:31.125
Be patient,

04:31.126 --> 04:32.493
But don't treat him
with kid gloves.

04:32.494 --> 04:34.562
It makes him crazy.

04:34.563 --> 04:35.863
Okay, done.

04:35.864 --> 04:37.465
Anything for the guy,

04:37.466 --> 04:38.900
But he's off
the mission list, right?

04:41.336 --> 04:43.271
I'll talk to him.

04:43.272 --> 04:44.572
Thank you.

04:46.208 --> 04:47.542
How do you like
the new magna-slinger?

04:47.543 --> 04:48.576
The weapon, yes.

04:48.577 --> 04:49.610
The name...

04:49.611 --> 04:52.080
It's a work in progress.

04:52.081 --> 04:52.980
I'll email you options?

04:52.981 --> 04:54.015
Thank you.

04:55.217 --> 04:56.417
Magnus--

04:56.418 --> 04:58.853
Will's not the only one
off the mission list.

04:58.854 --> 05:00.221
You'll be all right
in a few weeks.

05:00.222 --> 05:02.523
There are issues
we need to address.

05:02.524 --> 05:04.926
I'm fully aware
of the situation, declan,

05:04.927 --> 05:06.260
And I appreciate
your concern--

05:06.261 --> 05:08.129
What if you lose?

05:08.130 --> 05:10.064
You're back in charge,
but only by a thread.

05:10.065 --> 05:11.499
People think
we simply got lucky.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.533
Do you think
this is the first time

05:12.534 --> 05:14.368
I've made unpopular
decisions?

05:14.369 --> 05:16.571
The threat forsythe posed
has been eliminated.

05:16.572 --> 05:18.239
Bertha's alive
and in containment.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.240
I think we're fine.

05:19.241 --> 05:20.608
I disagree.

05:20.609 --> 05:21.909
Yeah, you
showed up wexford

05:21.910 --> 05:23.111
For the tosser he is,

05:23.112 --> 05:24.112
But he didn't
act alone.

05:24.113 --> 05:25.179
He had support.

05:25.180 --> 05:26.948
Which evaporated
when he became unstable.

05:26.949 --> 05:29.250
Yeah, some would say
the same about you.

05:29.251 --> 05:30.318
I just mean,

05:30.319 --> 05:31.185
Your next move
is important.

05:31.186 --> 05:32.520
Currying
political favor?

05:32.521 --> 05:34.522
I'd rather
drink coffee.

05:34.523 --> 05:36.190
Besides there's
a far more pressing question

05:36.191 --> 05:37.558
That needs answering.

05:37.559 --> 05:39.627
The counterwave
off pakistan.

05:39.628 --> 05:41.329
Three land-based
earthquakes,

05:41.330 --> 05:42.663
Each perfectly timed

05:42.664 --> 05:43.998
To stop a massive
tidal surge

05:43.999 --> 05:45.600
From hitting
the pakistani coast.

05:45.601 --> 05:48.002
Zero abnormal activity
on any scans.

05:48.003 --> 05:49.437
Millions of lives saved.

05:49.438 --> 05:51.239
No explanation.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.306
It wasn't bertha,

05:52.307 --> 05:54.108
But it was something
equally as powerful.

05:54.109 --> 05:55.643
Maybe more so.

05:55.644 --> 05:56.677
In the meantime,

05:56.678 --> 05:58.412
The conference call
tomorrow?

05:59.648 --> 06:00.982
I'll be on
my best behavior.

06:00.983 --> 06:03.050
I promise.

06:03.051 --> 06:04.585
Kate...

06:06.922 --> 06:08.189
You in or out?

06:08.190 --> 06:10.958
As if I had
a bloody choice.

06:13.295 --> 06:15.463
I need money.

06:15.464 --> 06:16.664
How much and what for?

06:16.665 --> 06:17.832
A lot,

06:17.833 --> 06:19.066
But for
a good cause.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.935
I got a line
on an ex-cabal spook

06:20.936 --> 06:22.470
Who was really high up
on their operations

06:22.471 --> 06:24.071
Before we took them down.

06:24.072 --> 06:25.139
And he knows
something

06:25.140 --> 06:26.140
About the pakistani
counterwave?

06:26.141 --> 06:27.175
Not exactly.

06:27.176 --> 06:28.242
But he claims
to know of an abnormal

06:28.243 --> 06:29.310
That could have
caused it.

06:30.546 --> 06:32.146
But he won't talk
unless we pay him.

06:32.147 --> 06:33.514
With a samsonite
full of cash.

06:33.515 --> 06:35.283
It's part of the whole new
post-cabal economy.

06:35.284 --> 06:36.517
A whole lot of info
on the market,

06:36.518 --> 06:37.919
If you know
where to shop.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.020
Fine.

06:39.021 --> 06:40.321
So, are we talkin'
the caymans account,

06:40.322 --> 06:41.422
Or the one in geneva?

06:41.423 --> 06:42.523
Neither.

06:42.524 --> 06:43.558
Oh, the private bank
in malta.

06:43.559 --> 06:44.692
Excellent choice.

06:44.693 --> 06:46.594
Oh, come on.

06:46.595 --> 06:48.930
You're surprised I know
where all your money is?

06:48.931 --> 06:50.932
No, only that it's all
still accounted for.

06:51.967 --> 06:54.168
Um, by the way,

06:54.169 --> 06:57.605
You are taking him off
the mission list, right?

06:57.606 --> 06:59.340
Right?

07:09.384 --> 07:12.954
I recall joe dimaggio
describing the game to me once.

07:12.955 --> 07:14.088
Hmm.

07:14.089 --> 07:15.189
He must've left this bit out.

07:15.190 --> 07:17.258
Joltin' joe, huh?

07:20.696 --> 07:22.396
I'm just trying to figure out

07:22.397 --> 07:24.065
How the hell
I became a liability here.

07:24.066 --> 07:26.033
Yeah, you and me both.

07:26.034 --> 07:27.568
Gee, thanks.

07:27.569 --> 07:30.104
No, I'm sorry, I meant me.
Politics.

07:30.105 --> 07:33.074
Right, wexford
and the unbelievers.

07:34.176 --> 07:35.476
Hey, that's a good name
for a band.

07:35.477 --> 07:36.477
Will--

07:36.478 --> 07:37.445
No,

07:37.446 --> 07:40.281
I don't remember anything.

07:40.282 --> 07:41.549
And believe me,

07:41.550 --> 07:42.984
If I thought I could
make up some cool crap

07:42.985 --> 07:45.519
That might help you
defend yourself, I would.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.154
As it stands,

07:47.155 --> 07:48.489
I'm all out of ideas.

07:48.490 --> 07:49.657
I was going to say

07:49.658 --> 07:51.125
We'll figure this out.

07:52.594 --> 07:56.664
You're this cutting-edge
famous doctor

07:56.665 --> 07:58.332
Who works with monsters.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.701
You've run every test
known to science on me.

08:00.702 --> 08:03.037
Catscans, bloodwork, mris,

08:03.038 --> 08:06.407
Hell, sentient leeches.

08:06.408 --> 08:08.276
You got nothing.

08:08.277 --> 08:10.011
You're suffering
post traumatic stress.

08:10.012 --> 08:11.479
I know what I'm suffering!

08:11.480 --> 08:13.314
I'm the guy who sits across
from people who suffer from it!

08:13.315 --> 08:15.583
You were clinically dead!

08:15.584 --> 08:16.651
We have no idea

08:16.652 --> 08:18.152
What that does
to the mind.

08:18.153 --> 08:20.021
You stop sleeping.

08:20.022 --> 08:21.455
You wish you'd never come back.

08:22.724 --> 08:25.693
And don't say, "give it time,"

08:25.694 --> 08:28.329
Because we've already had
that chat.

08:28.330 --> 08:29.764
It's a classic.

08:29.765 --> 08:30.998
We both know something
happened to you

08:30.999 --> 08:32.099
After you died.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.534
Something profound.

08:34.535 --> 08:37.605
So a giant spider
stopped a tidal wave.

08:37.606 --> 08:39.039
I know it's meant
to be connected.

08:39.041 --> 08:41.107
I just don't know if I had
anything to do with it or not.

08:41.109 --> 08:43.711
All right, how about this--

08:43.712 --> 08:45.546
You shouldn't even
be alive right now.

08:45.547 --> 08:47.181
Your resurrection

08:47.182 --> 08:48.683
Should have been
impossible.

08:48.684 --> 08:51.552
Enduring torture,
losing the makri, flatlining...

08:52.988 --> 08:54.689
What's a little light death
between friends?

08:54.690 --> 08:56.657
We'll find out
what all this means.

08:56.658 --> 08:58.559
I promise you.

09:01.663 --> 09:04.265
But I'm off the mission list?

09:07.169 --> 09:08.569
I'm sorry, will.

09:08.570 --> 09:11.639
Don't be.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.241
I'm surprised
it took you this long.

09:14.242 --> 09:15.443
Look, about last night,
I don't know--

09:15.444 --> 09:16.644
You need rest.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.715
That's funny.

09:20.716 --> 09:22.216
Ha ha.

09:22.217 --> 09:24.018
No, I mean it.
[pills rattle]

09:24.019 --> 09:27.621
I know you hate
taking meds,

09:27.622 --> 09:30.291
But no more excuses.

09:48.310 --> 09:50.111
Aw, come on.

09:52.414 --> 09:54.148
Hey.

09:54.149 --> 09:55.683
Hey.

09:55.684 --> 09:57.184
How's the new guy?

09:57.185 --> 09:59.053
He's sleeping off
some voltage.

09:59.054 --> 10:01.255
He should wake up
sometime next week.

10:01.256 --> 10:02.723
Good.

10:02.724 --> 10:04.225
Good...

10:06.228 --> 10:08.796
That net thing,

10:08.797 --> 10:09.764
Was awesome.

10:09.765 --> 10:12.099
Worked great.

10:15.771 --> 10:17.338
Oh, come on...

10:17.339 --> 10:19.039
All right? I screwed up.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.241
I screwed up totally tonight.

10:20.242 --> 10:21.575
Nah.

10:21.576 --> 10:22.543
Nah, you're fine.

10:22.544 --> 10:24.044
Forget it.

10:24.045 --> 10:25.179
Will you stop it?

10:25.180 --> 10:26.614
Stop it with the nice.

10:26.615 --> 10:27.748
Come on,
where's the complaining?

10:27.749 --> 10:28.783
Where's the grief?

10:28.784 --> 10:30.584
Biggie, where's
the slap in the head?

10:30.585 --> 10:32.253
What am I, someone else?

10:32.254 --> 10:33.320
Dude, you...

10:33.321 --> 10:35.589
You kinda...
You rose from the dead.

10:35.590 --> 10:37.558
Even around here,
that's out there.

10:37.559 --> 10:38.359
I did it.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.261
You had help.

10:40.262 --> 10:42.196
Chilean shepherd frog
secretions.

10:43.365 --> 10:45.332
I just need to sleep.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.700
Yeah.

10:46.701 --> 10:47.535
We tried that--

10:47.536 --> 10:50.237
Yeah.

10:50.238 --> 10:54.542
We put some of the big guy's
special herbs into your food.

10:54.543 --> 10:56.811
Didn't make a dent.

11:01.383 --> 11:05.085
Well, um, that explains
the stomach cramps,

11:05.086 --> 11:06.320
And the, uh--

11:06.321 --> 11:07.188
Whoa...

11:07.189 --> 11:08.756
It was worth a shot.

11:09.758 --> 11:12.526
Anyway,
it won't happen again

11:12.527 --> 11:14.395
Because I'm off
the mission list,

11:14.396 --> 11:16.163
Effective tonight.

11:16.164 --> 11:18.399
Oh, finally.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.600
Hey, ace...

11:19.601 --> 11:22.269
It's just a slump.

11:22.270 --> 11:24.705
You'll get it back.

11:24.706 --> 11:25.773
Yeah.

12:56.197 --> 12:57.598
Jeez...

12:57.599 --> 12:59.767
What is this?

12:59.768 --> 13:00.901
I had no idea you were coming.

13:00.902 --> 13:02.937
Seriously,

13:02.938 --> 13:04.638
I couldn't sense anything.

13:04.639 --> 13:06.840
I know.

13:08.310 --> 13:10.244
What in the sweet
sidney crosby's going on?

14:13.775 --> 14:15.409
<i>What is this place?</i>

14:16.378 --> 14:17.478
<i>Kali!</i>

14:27.656 --> 14:29.289
Ah!

14:46.074 --> 14:48.208
Most sedatives are designed
to be overridden by adrenaline.

14:48.209 --> 14:50.310
Whatever happened to you
had to have been quite intense

14:50.311 --> 14:51.745
In order for you
to remain alert.

14:51.746 --> 14:53.280
Whoa, "whatever
happened?"

14:53.281 --> 14:54.782
I'm not thinking that.

14:54.783 --> 14:55.816
"he's insane."

14:55.817 --> 14:57.017
"he's exhausted."

14:57.018 --> 14:58.085
Nothing on
the security cameras.

14:58.086 --> 14:59.653
No signs of intruders.

14:59.654 --> 15:02.156
No evidence that anyone,
anything, was in my room.

15:02.157 --> 15:05.092
Look, the brain
slips badly with no rest.

15:05.093 --> 15:07.261
Hallucinations, paranoia...

15:07.262 --> 15:08.262
Delusions.

15:08.263 --> 15:09.630
Trouble with
logical reasoning.

15:09.631 --> 15:11.065
Insane.

15:11.066 --> 15:14.201
It was a nightmare.

15:14.202 --> 15:15.302
You've been through a lot.

15:16.805 --> 15:18.972
So I died.

15:18.973 --> 15:20.874
How long am I
gonna use that crutch?

15:20.875 --> 15:23.343
And, you know, it's
a terrible pick-up line.

15:24.646 --> 15:27.281
I want to remember, magnus.

15:27.282 --> 15:30.384
I get these images,
these flashes,

15:30.385 --> 15:32.653
But this...

15:32.654 --> 15:33.687
Was different.

15:33.688 --> 15:36.156
I could feel everything.

15:36.157 --> 15:38.859
It was so real.

15:40.662 --> 15:42.930
I'm keeping you
under observation.

15:42.931 --> 15:44.331
No more pills.

15:44.332 --> 15:45.966
You need something
stronger,

15:45.967 --> 15:46.934
And someone
will be with you

15:46.935 --> 15:47.968
The entire time,

15:47.969 --> 15:49.069
Just in case.

15:51.673 --> 15:54.341
[magnus]: So, are we
financially ruined?

15:54.342 --> 15:55.442
With your net worth,

15:55.443 --> 15:56.643
We'll limp along

15:56.644 --> 15:58.345
For about another
300 years.

15:58.346 --> 16:00.748
This was worth it.

16:02.984 --> 16:04.485
So...

16:04.486 --> 16:06.887
The counterwave earthquakes
originated on land, correct?

16:06.888 --> 16:08.355
Yeah, they had to,

16:08.356 --> 16:09.556
In order to blunt the wave

16:09.557 --> 16:10.624
That was headed
towards pakistan.

16:10.625 --> 16:11.658
Satellite tracking
confirms

16:11.659 --> 16:13.160
The epicenter's here,

16:13.161 --> 16:14.862
Near the iranian border.

16:14.863 --> 16:16.830
Okay, I know I don't
pay attention in class,

16:16.831 --> 16:19.099
But bertha is a sea-dwelling
creature only, right?

16:19.100 --> 16:21.001
A land-based earthquake
isn't her m.O.

16:21.002 --> 16:22.035
Absolutely not.

16:22.036 --> 16:23.871
Then this could be huge.

16:26.074 --> 16:27.708
2005, indonesia.

16:27.709 --> 16:30.177
Big hush-hush
cabal operation goes down.

16:30.178 --> 16:32.913
The bad guys are tracking
an unidentified abnormal

16:32.914 --> 16:34.882
In the underground caves
near kartosuro.

16:34.883 --> 16:36.416
They get a fix,
they move in.

16:36.417 --> 16:38.352
Next thing you know...

16:38.353 --> 16:39.453
Boom!

16:39.454 --> 16:41.155
Instant strata-volcano.

16:41.156 --> 16:43.857
No seismic warnings.

16:43.858 --> 16:45.058
400 cabal agents vaporized.

16:45.059 --> 16:46.426
The entire area
is a disaster zone.

16:46.427 --> 16:47.761
Yes, marapi.

16:47.762 --> 16:49.229
The volcano
was considered extinct.

16:49.230 --> 16:51.031
Which means whatever
they were tracking

16:51.032 --> 16:51.899
Set it off.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.700
Possibly.

16:53.701 --> 16:55.135
I've heard the rumors.

16:55.136 --> 16:57.104
I thought the cabal
were testing a weapon.

16:57.105 --> 16:58.839
Well, maybe they were trying
to capture something,

16:58.840 --> 17:00.107
And it didn't like it,

17:00.108 --> 17:01.742
And I'm thinking
whatever did this,

17:01.743 --> 17:03.744
Maybe it's somehow
connected to bertha

17:03.745 --> 17:06.046
I-in that whole...
Woo-woo theory

17:06.047 --> 17:08.882
You have.

17:08.883 --> 17:10.416
And then wexford
bombs her island...

17:10.417 --> 17:12.152
And mystery monster jumps in,

17:12.153 --> 17:15.021
Launches the perfect earthquake
to stop the final wave.

17:15.022 --> 17:16.089
Saves the day.

17:17.157 --> 17:18.392
It's a start,

17:18.393 --> 17:19.459
But we need more.

17:19.460 --> 17:21.060
Proof that
this other creature

17:21.061 --> 17:22.362
Actually exists.

17:22.363 --> 17:23.730
You got it.

17:23.731 --> 17:25.965
So, the copenhagen account?

17:25.967 --> 17:26.967
I-I'm just saying.

17:26.968 --> 17:29.937
You have these-
these huge hairy hands,

17:29.938 --> 17:31.271
And yet you assist magnus

17:31.272 --> 17:33.340
In these sensitive
medical procedures.

17:33.341 --> 17:34.775
And?

17:34.776 --> 17:35.943
What, it's never
been a problem?

17:35.944 --> 17:37.811
Not for me.

17:39.447 --> 17:41.481
That's funny.

17:41.482 --> 17:43.317
No, no, no, wait,
just give me a second here.

17:43.318 --> 17:45.752
What, are you going to
hit the gym?

17:45.753 --> 17:47.721
[sighs]
what is that?

17:47.722 --> 17:48.856
It's called
"twilight."

17:50.758 --> 17:51.892
What do you think
of those movies?

17:51.893 --> 17:53.727
I liked marcus.

17:53.728 --> 17:57.231
Relax.

17:57.232 --> 17:58.298
Okay...

18:05.340 --> 18:07.808
I'll stay with you
until you wake up.

18:07.809 --> 18:12.045
Yeah?

18:12.046 --> 18:13.113
I promise.

18:14.515 --> 18:15.949
This is ridiculous.
I feel like I'm 10 years old.

18:15.950 --> 18:17.885
Well, to me, you are.

18:22.257 --> 18:24.291
All right,
call in the air strike.

18:26.361 --> 18:28.028
It's done.

18:29.264 --> 18:30.998
So, what are you going to do?

18:30.999 --> 18:35.102
I brought a book.

18:37.238 --> 18:39.306
Nice.

18:42.410 --> 18:46.213
So how long do you think
it'll take before--

18:46.214 --> 18:49.182
Sweet dreams.

18:51.085 --> 18:53.820
Clean up operations
are continuing in mumbai

18:53.821 --> 18:55.122
And several other
coastal areas

18:55.123 --> 18:56.256
Hit by the first wave.

18:56.257 --> 18:57.991
As far as
bertha is concerned,

18:57.992 --> 19:00.394
The security protocols
we've put in place

19:00.395 --> 19:02.296
Are now running
at optimal levels.

19:02.297 --> 19:04.564
The magnetic resonance pattern
we're coating her with

19:04.565 --> 19:06.867
Is keeping her
in a permanent state of calm.

19:06.868 --> 19:08.101
She's happy.

19:08.102 --> 19:09.970
All tests
of the new system

19:09.971 --> 19:12.072
Show no flaw
or weaknesses.

19:12.073 --> 19:13.573
Since the death of the makri,

19:13.574 --> 19:15.275
There have been no other
reports of aberrant behavior

19:15.276 --> 19:17.144
Among any abnormals
worldwide.

19:17.145 --> 19:19.346
We believe bertha
is now fully secure.

19:19.347 --> 19:21.381
<i>I believe there's
a far more pressing matter</i>

19:21.382 --> 19:22.549
<i>That we need to address,</i>

19:22.550 --> 19:24.451
<i>Regarding
your continuing role</i>

19:24.452 --> 19:27.120
<i>As the head of the global
sanctuary network.</i>

19:27.121 --> 19:28.388
Terrence, please,

19:28.389 --> 19:29.623
If you're planning
another coup,

19:29.624 --> 19:30.824
Could you do it
when I'm not on the call?

19:30.825 --> 19:33.026
So now you're speaking
for everyone?

19:33.027 --> 19:34.428
Mate, I'd say you had
more to answer for

19:34.429 --> 19:36.163
Than she does.

19:36.164 --> 19:37.531
<i>I doubt that.</i>

19:37.532 --> 19:39.099
<i>All we did
was dodge a bullet</i>

19:39.100 --> 19:40.801
<i>By letting bertha
remain alive.</i>

19:40.802 --> 19:41.835
A bullet?

19:41.836 --> 19:45.872
Why, you obnoxious
piece of--

19:45.873 --> 19:48.275
Gregory magnus founded
this organization

19:48.276 --> 19:49.910
To help abnormals,

19:49.911 --> 19:53.313
To protect them,
to understand them.

19:53.314 --> 19:55.515
My father taught me

19:55.516 --> 19:57.918
That we have more to learn
by protecting life,

19:57.919 --> 19:59.052
All life,

19:59.053 --> 20:01.488
Than by simply destroying it.

20:01.489 --> 20:03.390
That's why I kept bertha alive,

20:03.391 --> 20:04.992
And that's why we need
to discover the power

20:04.993 --> 20:07.060
Behind the karachi counterwave.

20:07.061 --> 20:09.429
<i>[woman]:  You did
act independently,</i>

20:09.430 --> 20:11.164
<i>And you did
lie to us</i>

20:11.165 --> 20:13.333
<i>About keeping
bertha alive,</i>

20:13.334 --> 20:16.236
<i>But you also took
complete responsibility</i>

20:16.237 --> 20:17.537
<i>For your actions.</i>

20:17.538 --> 20:19.840
<i>You almost gave
your life to save hers.</i>

20:21.909 --> 20:23.410
<i>As you once said,</i>

20:23.411 --> 20:25.912
<i>It's what happens
after a crisis</i>

20:25.913 --> 20:27.047
<i>That matters.</i>

20:29.384 --> 20:32.052
<i>There's been a vote.</i>

20:32.053 --> 20:33.453
<i>We wish you to remain</i>

20:33.454 --> 20:35.555
<i>As head of
the global network.</i>

20:35.556 --> 20:37.124
<i>The vote was
unanimous.</i>

20:37.125 --> 20:38.558
<i>With all due respect,</i>

20:38.559 --> 20:40.360
<i>I was not part
of that vote.</i>

20:40.361 --> 20:42.496
<i>It was reserved for
heads of house only.</i>

20:42.497 --> 20:44.965
<i>Your position as head
of the new york sanctuary</i>

20:44.966 --> 20:45.899
<i>Has been rescinded.</i>

20:45.900 --> 20:46.933
<i>Excuse me?</i>

20:46.934 --> 20:48.969
<i>Also a unanimous decision.</i>

20:48.970 --> 20:51.271
You fired on an unarmed
civilian ship

20:51.272 --> 20:52.239
With the full knowledge

20:52.240 --> 20:53.407
There were people
on board.

20:53.408 --> 20:55.275
You failed to alert
international authorities,

20:55.276 --> 20:58.045
And gave no regard
to the danger faced

20:58.046 --> 20:59.246
By sanctuary crews.

20:59.247 --> 21:00.514
<i>Very well.</i>

21:00.515 --> 21:03.283
<i>[woman]:  I trust this puts
this issue at rest,</i>

21:03.284 --> 21:05.886
<i>As there are far more
pressing matters at hand.</i>

21:05.887 --> 21:07.587
Thank you,

21:07.588 --> 21:08.588
Everyone.

21:08.589 --> 21:10.457
<i>Thank you, helen.</i>

21:10.458 --> 21:13.160
[all signing off
in their respective languages]

21:14.929 --> 21:16.329
Cheeky bastard.

21:17.465 --> 21:19.633
I guess my work
here's done.

21:50.965 --> 21:53.366
<i>[will]:  What is this place?
Who are they?</i>

21:53.367 --> 21:56.603
<i>[kali]:  I will attempt
to grant you your wish.</i>

21:58.606 --> 21:59.473
<i>Kali!</i>

23:19.220 --> 23:20.353
Holy hell!

23:20.354 --> 23:22.022
Magnus!

23:28.563 --> 23:30.263
Dear god.

23:30.264 --> 23:31.131
What the hell
is that?

23:31.132 --> 23:31.998
No!

23:36.695 --> 23:38.430
Quickly!

23:41.400 --> 23:43.668
Seal the door!

23:49.608 --> 23:51.910
What did they do,
teleport?

23:51.911 --> 23:53.912
No, it's not possible.
The em shield's up.

24:08.727 --> 24:09.761
Check him.

24:15.301 --> 24:16.701
He's okay.

24:16.702 --> 24:19.370
What the hell
were they?

24:21.507 --> 24:24.342
Absolutely no idea.

24:37.957 --> 24:39.691
Stunners and tranqs only,

24:39.692 --> 24:42.260
And I want 'round the clock
watch on will.

24:42.261 --> 24:43.928
Henry and the big guy
are with him already.

24:43.929 --> 24:44.863
Roof to catacombs,

24:44.864 --> 24:46.297
We're finding
these creature

24:46.298 --> 24:48.566
And I want all of henry's
tracking devices modified

24:48.567 --> 24:50.368
To compensate for
their cloaking ability.

24:50.369 --> 24:51.669
You think they're
still here somewhere?

24:51.670 --> 24:53.071
I'm sure of it.

24:53.072 --> 24:54.772
Whatever they came here for,
we interrupted them.

24:54.773 --> 24:56.307
Okay, new rule.

24:56.308 --> 24:57.876
No eggs before bed.

24:57.877 --> 25:00.478
The dreams are way too crazy.

25:00.479 --> 25:01.880
I'm sorry
I doubted you.

25:01.881 --> 25:04.649
Yeah, well, at least
I slept through the whole thing.

25:04.650 --> 25:07.252
Oh, "twilight," by the way,
is fabulous.

25:07.253 --> 25:09.454
Well, whoever--
whatever they are--

25:09.455 --> 25:11.823
They targeted you
specifically.

25:11.824 --> 25:14.259
Yeah, you said
they put something on my head?

25:14.260 --> 25:15.894
Yeah, I've never seen
anything like it,

25:15.895 --> 25:17.795
And their ability
to cloak themselves,

25:17.796 --> 25:19.564
It's almost as if
they can bend light around them.

25:19.565 --> 25:21.232
None of our
security systems

25:21.233 --> 25:22.166
Can detect them.

25:22.167 --> 25:24.035
Thermal, motion scans,
sound waves,

25:24.036 --> 25:25.503
Nothing picks them up.

25:25.504 --> 25:27.472
You think it's a special
ability they have,

25:27.473 --> 25:28.940
Or some sort of technology?

25:28.941 --> 25:30.842
I don't even know
what kind of abnormal they are.

25:30.843 --> 25:33.044
Well, I'm glad

25:33.045 --> 25:34.846
We're overflowing
with information.

25:34.847 --> 25:36.481
Hello.

25:36.482 --> 25:37.715
What?

25:39.351 --> 25:41.419
Can you feel that?

25:41.420 --> 25:43.388
What, your finger
in my ear?

25:44.557 --> 25:45.757
Two incisions.

25:45.758 --> 25:46.824
Very small.

25:46.825 --> 25:48.693
That thing
put holes in my skull?

25:48.694 --> 25:50.528
Amazing.

25:50.529 --> 25:52.730
No residual sensation.

25:52.731 --> 25:53.965
Their device must be

25:53.966 --> 25:55.567
A microscopic probe
of some sort.

25:55.568 --> 25:56.668
A probe?

25:56.669 --> 25:57.769
For what?

25:57.770 --> 25:59.537
Interesting.

25:59.538 --> 26:01.372
It would have been
accessible from here,

26:01.373 --> 26:02.607
But still, it hardly
makes sense--

26:02.608 --> 26:03.775
Magnus...

26:03.776 --> 26:04.876
Probing for what?

26:06.445 --> 26:07.512
Your memories.

26:08.948 --> 26:10.848
Come on...

26:10.849 --> 26:13.651
You get that from
two holes in my skull?

26:13.652 --> 26:14.852
The incisions
are centered here,

26:14.853 --> 26:16.921
At the base of
the hippocampus,

26:16.922 --> 26:18.089
Center of the brain
that controls--

26:18.090 --> 26:19.691
Memories, right.
I get it.

26:19.692 --> 26:22.493
So the device is about
retrieving information.

26:22.494 --> 26:23.461
Which would explain

26:23.462 --> 26:25.029
Why they didn't
kill you outright.

26:25.030 --> 26:26.664
Who are these guys?

26:26.665 --> 26:27.865
To be honest,

26:27.866 --> 26:29.634
I'm more interested
in what they're after,

26:29.635 --> 26:30.602
And why.

26:36.408 --> 26:38.676
This movement
scanner is useless.

26:38.677 --> 26:40.378
All I get are
messed-up signals.

26:40.379 --> 26:43.147
[sniffing]
yeah, saue.

26:43.148 --> 26:44.816
You really
can't sense them?

26:44.817 --> 26:45.817
Oh, they're
still around.

26:45.818 --> 26:47.518
I just can't
narrow it down.

26:47.519 --> 26:49.387
It's like they're
everywhere.

26:49.388 --> 26:51.055
Smelling's
an imperfect science,

26:51.056 --> 26:52.590
At least for me.

26:52.591 --> 26:53.691
So, what,
they skunk out the place

26:53.692 --> 26:55.760
So no one can
track their scent.

26:55.761 --> 26:57.795
You can't detect them
with sound or movement.

26:57.796 --> 27:00.365
I'm thinking thing one
and thing two

27:00.366 --> 27:01.766
Might be a lot like
you and the big guy.

27:01.767 --> 27:03.668
They've got built-in
early warning senses.

27:05.571 --> 27:08.006
So they can sense us,
but we can't sense them.

27:08.007 --> 27:09.374
Yeah.

27:09.375 --> 27:10.942
What do you say we change
the rules of the game?

27:10.943 --> 27:13.077
Come on.

27:17.449 --> 27:19.017
So it's all about overload
with these guys.

27:19.018 --> 27:21.753
They emit this smell that just,

27:21.754 --> 27:24.956
Once it gets in your nose,
god, it drives you crazy.

27:24.957 --> 27:26.124
I can't smell
anything.

27:26.125 --> 27:27.158
Can you guys?

27:27.159 --> 27:29.494
Makes my eyes water.

27:29.495 --> 27:30.762
Oh, yeah,
it's so bad right now,

27:30.763 --> 27:32.697
I couldn't track
a pastrami sandwich

27:32.698 --> 27:34.065
In a deli
at lunch hour.

27:34.066 --> 27:35.733
Okay, so your noses
are useless.

27:35.734 --> 27:37.535
None of our tracking
systems work.

27:37.536 --> 27:38.836
We compensate
for it how?

27:38.837 --> 27:40.838
Modified
chromatographic scanner.

27:40.839 --> 27:42.073
Typically used

27:42.074 --> 27:44.042
To detect chemical
weapons traces.

27:44.043 --> 27:46.644
Now, I've altered
the sensors to detect

27:46.645 --> 27:47.912
The densest
concentration

27:47.913 --> 27:49.714
Of "eau
d'invisible fugly".

27:49.715 --> 27:51.182
It's a bit of
a trial and error

27:51.183 --> 27:52.617
With the calibration.

27:52.618 --> 27:54.152
Sort of like tuning a guitar
with your nose.

27:54.153 --> 27:55.687
Which looks good on a resume.

27:55.688 --> 27:57.789
All right,
coordinated search.

27:57.790 --> 27:58.956
Stay in radio contact.

27:58.957 --> 28:00.425
Bring them back unharmed.

28:02.728 --> 28:04.028
I bet you're dying
for a rematch.

28:04.029 --> 28:05.496
Understatement.

28:18.477 --> 28:20.178
Oh, man...

28:22.781 --> 28:24.482
They shunted
the secondary power cables.

28:24.483 --> 28:25.616
Why would they do that?

28:25.617 --> 28:26.684
Why not mess with
the main grid?

28:26.685 --> 28:28.519
Maybe they needed
to recharge something.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.821
That's crafty.

28:30.989 --> 28:33.591
Movement.

28:33.592 --> 28:36.027
[quietly]: Give me
a target, hank.

28:37.696 --> 28:40.064
11:00.

28:43.268 --> 28:45.069
Ugh! Damn it.

28:45.070 --> 28:48.673
These suckers are fast.

29:28.614 --> 29:30.214
Hold on a second!

29:30.215 --> 29:31.816
Seriously!

29:31.817 --> 29:32.750
Will?

29:37.823 --> 29:38.723
Magnus?

29:39.858 --> 29:41.025
3:00.
Three feet away.

29:56.074 --> 29:58.543
Are you all right?

29:58.544 --> 29:59.577
Are you kidding?

29:59.578 --> 30:00.611
I love being the bait.

30:05.117 --> 30:06.784
He's out cold,

30:06.785 --> 30:08.152
And the crowd
goes wild.

30:08.153 --> 30:09.187
Three words, please.

30:09.188 --> 30:10.555
Well done, henry.

30:11.490 --> 30:13.524
We got 'em?

30:13.525 --> 30:15.927
Yeah,

30:15.928 --> 30:18.729
But what have we got?

30:40.536 --> 30:43.238
Their skin has incredible
reflective qualities,

30:43.239 --> 30:45.574
Which they seem to be able
to manipulate at will,

30:45.575 --> 30:47.242
Much like a chameleon.

30:47.243 --> 30:50.112
Coincidences are piling up
too thick around here.

30:50.113 --> 30:51.647
The makri, bertha,
the counterwave,

30:51.648 --> 30:52.547
Now this.

30:52.548 --> 30:53.749
I'm sure there's
a connection,

30:53.750 --> 30:55.851
But we just don't have
all the facts.

30:55.852 --> 30:57.219
Whatever memories
these guys are after

30:57.220 --> 30:58.420
Must be from when I...

30:58.421 --> 30:59.421
You know.

30:59.422 --> 31:01.289
Kicked the bucket?

31:01.290 --> 31:03.225
Bought the farm?

31:03.226 --> 31:04.059
Crossed over?

31:04.060 --> 31:05.327
Are you finished?

31:05.328 --> 31:06.528
Pushed up daisies?

31:06.529 --> 31:09.698
It would also explain
your extreme amnesia.

31:09.699 --> 31:11.633
Repressed memories
trying to surface

31:11.634 --> 31:13.168
Would wreak havoc
with the conscious mind,

31:13.169 --> 31:14.269
Wouldn't they?

31:14.270 --> 31:15.504
Hey, I've tried everything.

31:15.505 --> 31:18.240
Meditation, hypnosis,
even drug therapy,

31:18.241 --> 31:19.741
Which I hate.

31:19.742 --> 31:21.410
Whatever happened to me
on the other side

31:21.411 --> 31:23.578
Isn't that easy to recall.

31:23.579 --> 31:24.780
Well, maybe it's nothing.

31:24.781 --> 31:27.182
Maybe it's a bunch
of psycho mumbo jumbo

31:27.183 --> 31:28.183
From your imagination.

31:28.184 --> 31:29.618
Psychologist?

31:29.619 --> 31:30.919
The memories
will come

31:30.920 --> 31:33.155
When they're ready,
if at all.

31:33.156 --> 31:34.256
What if it's
something important?

31:34.257 --> 31:36.425
What if it's something

31:36.426 --> 31:38.226
That can help you prove
what started the counterwave,

31:38.227 --> 31:39.828
Or bertha's connectedness?

31:41.130 --> 31:42.431
I'm just sayin',

31:42.432 --> 31:44.499
If my subconscious
won't let me sleep,

31:44.500 --> 31:45.434
It's got to be big.

31:48.271 --> 31:50.572
Oh, cool.

31:50.573 --> 31:51.973
Cool...

31:51.974 --> 31:54.142
Cool. This is
very, very cool--

31:54.143 --> 31:55.677
Please stop
saying that.

31:55.678 --> 31:56.712
Right.

31:56.713 --> 31:57.846
I just can't believe
this thing does

31:57.847 --> 31:59.314
What we think it does.

31:59.315 --> 32:01.249
Who comes up with
a design this simple?

32:01.250 --> 32:02.751
I know.

32:02.752 --> 32:03.885
It's light years ahead of
any technology I've ever seen.

32:03.886 --> 32:05.520
Really?

32:05.521 --> 32:06.788
From these guys?

32:06.789 --> 32:09.825
Do you think
maybe they're, um...

32:09.826 --> 32:11.259
[whispering]:
Not of this earth?

32:13.629 --> 32:14.796
Don't be ridiculous.

32:15.898 --> 32:18.233
They're abnormals.
Get a grip.

32:18.234 --> 32:20.168
Cool device,
chameleon people?

32:20.169 --> 32:21.303
Never mind.

32:21.304 --> 32:22.370
Can you make it work?

32:23.906 --> 32:25.273
We stumble onto

32:25.274 --> 32:26.408
A super-advanced
alien mind probe,

32:26.409 --> 32:27.542
And you want a rush job?

32:27.543 --> 32:29.211
I'm still looking for
the "on" switch, will.

32:29.212 --> 32:30.879
I'm going to
prepare the lab.

32:30.880 --> 32:34.750
Stop fawning over it
and figure it out.

32:34.751 --> 32:37.652
[muttering]:
Alien mind probe...

32:37.653 --> 32:39.621
It could happen.

33:18.361 --> 33:19.961
So not cool!

33:21.831 --> 33:22.831
No power-up command.

33:22.832 --> 33:24.232
No control interface,

33:24.233 --> 33:25.667
Yet somehow they're
able to juice it

33:25.668 --> 33:28.336
Using a standard ac cable
from our basement.

33:28.337 --> 33:31.306
I futz with it,
it zaps me.

33:31.307 --> 33:33.408
I think it's cute.

33:33.409 --> 33:35.477
That's great, it likes you.

33:35.478 --> 33:36.645
Oh, come on, hank.

33:36.646 --> 33:38.513
Be the genius.
You said it was simple, right?

33:38.514 --> 33:40.482
Maybe you're just
over-thinking it.

33:40.483 --> 33:42.584
Try treating it nicer.

33:42.585 --> 33:43.652
I've tried nice.

33:43.653 --> 33:46.021
I've tried power surges,

33:46.022 --> 33:47.789
I've tried radio waves,
sonics, air pressure.

33:47.790 --> 33:50.358
I just want to turn
the damn thing on!

33:50.359 --> 33:51.693
Oh!

33:56.699 --> 33:58.333
Whoa.

34:04.674 --> 34:07.576
Whoa, that's awesome.

34:38.808 --> 34:41.275
We have a fire
on the secure level!

35:14.610 --> 35:16.912
Dammit.

35:25.588 --> 35:26.888
Self destruct?

35:26.889 --> 35:28.423
Isn't that
a little defeatist?

35:28.424 --> 35:29.557
Well, my guess is

35:29.558 --> 35:30.926
Once they realized
they'd been compromised,

35:30.927 --> 35:31.993
They saw
no other option.

35:31.994 --> 35:33.495
Which means
all we have left

35:33.496 --> 35:34.763
Is this.

35:34.764 --> 35:36.364
Yeah, and once
it activated

35:36.365 --> 35:37.799
I was able to understand
its primary functions.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.968
This is an amazingly
intuitive design.

35:39.969 --> 35:42.604
It actually seeks out brainwaves
of a certain frequency.

35:42.605 --> 35:44.940
It can deliberately
key in on eeg readings

35:44.941 --> 35:46.541
Associated with
deep memory.

35:46.542 --> 35:47.642
What for?

35:47.643 --> 35:48.643
Well, at its
highest level,

35:48.644 --> 35:49.844
It would erase them

35:49.845 --> 35:51.379
By essentially
overloading the brain

35:51.380 --> 35:52.948
With a massive jolt
of electricity.

35:52.949 --> 35:54.382
Uh...

35:54.383 --> 35:55.750
However,

35:55.751 --> 35:57.686
Uh, I have managed
to drastically reduce

35:57.687 --> 35:59.054
The energy output.

35:59.055 --> 36:01.423
We think its
other function

36:01.424 --> 36:02.557
Is to stimulate
the hippocampus

36:02.558 --> 36:03.925
In a positive manner.

36:03.926 --> 36:06.528
To retrieve memories trapped
within the subconscious.

36:06.529 --> 36:07.996
Are you sure
about this?

36:07.997 --> 36:09.364
I mean, didn't you just
learn how it works,

36:09.365 --> 36:10.732
Like,
20 minutes ago?

36:10.733 --> 36:12.901
Yes, but I think
I have it down now.

36:12.902 --> 36:13.969
You think?
He thinks.

36:13.970 --> 36:15.303
And I dropped it.

36:16.305 --> 36:17.906
But it's fine.

36:17.907 --> 36:18.740
It's fine.

36:20.576 --> 36:22.844
You don't have
to do this, will.

36:22.845 --> 36:25.447
Seriously?

36:27.883 --> 36:29.517
Look, we need answers.

36:29.518 --> 36:30.485
Let's do it.

36:33.022 --> 36:34.456
All right.

36:49.638 --> 36:53.641
Will, can you tell us
what you see?

36:55.478 --> 36:58.413
<i>[will]:  I remember dying...</i>

36:58.414 --> 36:59.647
<i>Falling...</i>

36:59.648 --> 37:02.550
<i>Landing in
an amazing chamber...</i>

37:02.551 --> 37:03.952
[will]: What is this place?
Who are they?

37:03.953 --> 37:06.087
<i>There were two others.</i>

37:06.088 --> 37:08.890
[kali]: I will attempt
to grant you your wish.

37:10.860 --> 37:11.693
Kali!

37:13.796 --> 37:15.463
I don't know who you guys are,

37:15.464 --> 37:17.999
But if you're in here with her,
you must be powerful.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.734
Please, save her life!

37:19.735 --> 37:23.772
My world depends
on her survival.

37:26.776 --> 37:29.110
Why have you
come here?

37:29.111 --> 37:33.148
To beg kali
for mercy.

37:33.149 --> 37:37.385
Those who harm kali
harm us all.

37:37.386 --> 37:40.388
There would be retribution
were her life to end.

37:41.857 --> 37:43.958
I...

37:43.959 --> 37:45.927
Am kali's herald.

37:45.928 --> 37:49.664
I seek only to protect her.

37:49.665 --> 37:51.599
You allowed your
physical form to die.

37:53.569 --> 37:57.839
You've sacrificed all.

38:00.576 --> 38:01.876
We will grant your request.

38:01.877 --> 38:05.880
Such destruction
will serve no purpose.

38:05.881 --> 38:09.050
We will restore the balance.

38:09.051 --> 38:11.753
Thank you.

38:13.489 --> 38:14.722
Thank you.

38:16.826 --> 38:18.426
Will...

38:21.730 --> 38:23.498
Gregory?

38:23.499 --> 38:26.835
For helen.

38:34.910 --> 38:36.811
Remember.

38:45.020 --> 38:47.021
Oh, my god.

38:48.824 --> 38:49.791
Will?

38:52.528 --> 38:53.595
He was there.

38:55.431 --> 38:56.831
Who?

38:58.734 --> 39:00.135
Your father.

39:00.136 --> 39:01.936
What?

39:10.107 --> 39:12.108
Did he say
anything to you?

39:12.109 --> 39:13.709
<i>For helen.</i>

39:14.945 --> 39:17.480
He wanted me
to remember two numbers.

39:17.481 --> 39:19.348
26,

39:19.349 --> 39:21.317
34.

39:21.318 --> 39:23.853
Plus this symbol.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.172
And that's it?

39:43.173 --> 39:45.408
I woke up in mumbai
right after that.

39:45.409 --> 39:47.276
You said there was
another being

39:47.277 --> 39:48.344
That spoke to you,

39:48.345 --> 39:50.746
Something about
granting your request.

39:50.747 --> 39:53.182
Yeah, when kali was hurt,

39:53.183 --> 39:54.550
One of the others said
he would help.

39:54.551 --> 39:55.751
Something about

39:55.752 --> 39:57.853
The destruction
having no purpose.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.121
The final wave.

39:59.122 --> 40:02.525
If there was
an avatar for kali,

40:02.526 --> 40:03.559
Couldn't there be one

40:03.560 --> 40:05.494
For another powerful
abnormal as well?

40:05.495 --> 40:06.896
Yeah, like the one
that blew the cap

40:06.897 --> 40:08.230
Off the d dormant
volcano.

40:08.231 --> 40:09.332
Exactly.

40:09.333 --> 40:10.132
Kali falls,

40:10.133 --> 40:11.233
Another super abnormal steps in,

40:11.234 --> 40:13.135
Stops the wave before
it makes landfall.

40:13.136 --> 40:14.570
This all fits with
the timeline of events.

40:18.141 --> 40:19.775
"26, 34."

40:19.776 --> 40:22.645
And that symbol.

40:25.349 --> 40:26.782
Hang on.

40:35.225 --> 40:37.727
Gifts from my father.

40:37.728 --> 40:40.963
This one, for my 26th birthday.

40:43.834 --> 40:45.368
And...

40:46.370 --> 40:48.471
Wild guess,

40:48.472 --> 40:50.039
A gift for
your 34th birthday.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.408
Exactly.

40:52.409 --> 40:54.777
Ah, and here it is.

40:54.778 --> 40:55.978
A rare first edition

40:55.979 --> 40:59.048
Of michelangelo's
architectural designs.

40:59.049 --> 41:01.817
[henry]: Okay, it's
a paperweight and a book.

41:01.818 --> 41:03.352
I'm not seeing it.

41:03.353 --> 41:04.754
[kate]: Yeah,
I never met your dad,

41:04.755 --> 41:06.355
But is he always
this cryptic?

41:06.356 --> 41:07.823
[everyone in unison]: Yes.

41:07.824 --> 41:09.692
Last time we saw him
was about a year ago.

41:09.693 --> 41:11.594
Before that, it was
a couple of decades.

41:11.595 --> 41:12.928
Why make contact now?

41:12.929 --> 41:14.130
I mean, we didn't
even know

41:14.131 --> 41:15.598
He was still alive.

41:15.599 --> 41:16.532
Well, maybe he's not.

41:17.601 --> 41:20.636
I mean, you did see him

41:20.637 --> 41:21.971
"over there".

41:21.972 --> 41:23.673
There has to be a connection.

41:23.674 --> 41:26.909
My father never gave me a gift
without significance.

41:26.910 --> 41:30.146
He believed in
the ancient power of crystals,

41:30.147 --> 41:31.981
And that michelangelo's
had somehow tapped into

41:31.982 --> 41:33.783
An incredibly advanced
mathematical formula.

41:37.888 --> 41:38.988
Hello, darling.

42:09.152 --> 42:10.953
You have got
to be kidding me.

42:18.562 --> 42:19.962
Incredible.

42:31.775 --> 42:33.676
Did she just...

42:33.677 --> 42:34.677
Did he...

42:34.678 --> 42:36.479
Just go
with it, henry.

42:38.682 --> 42:39.849
Just go with

42:39.850 --> 42:42.184
"this is completely
impossible"?

42:42.185 --> 42:45.621
Exactly.

42:46.923 --> 42:50.025
What is this place?

42:50.026 --> 42:52.862
I have no idea,

42:52.863 --> 42:55.131
But this is a power
and technology

42:55.132 --> 42:56.732
Beyond anything
we've ever known.

42:56.733 --> 42:59.769
Do you think
it exists?

42:59.770 --> 43:02.171
Well, if it does,
we have to find it,

43:02.172 --> 43:03.672
Wherever it is.

43:05.942 --> 43:08.611
Thank you, father.
