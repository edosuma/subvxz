12:39.178 --> 12:41.747
BOND BOXES...

12:42.047 --> 12:44.216
ARMORED FACEPLATES...

12:44.316 --> 12:45.618
LOCKS AND LATCHES.

12:45.718 --> 12:48.153
- FUN STUFF.
- YEAH.

12:48.220 --> 12:49.588
- HOW'D YOU LEARN ALL THIS?

12:49.688 --> 12:51.457
- OLD MAN.

12:51.557 --> 12:53.726
- FAMILY BUSINESS, HUH?

12:54.026 --> 12:56.061
- YEAH.

12:56.161 --> 12:57.730
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

12:58.030 --> 13:01.967
- SAME SORT OF THING.
MY DAD WAS, UH, CONNECTED.

13:04.236 --> 13:05.304
- MOBBED UP?

13:05.371 --> 13:06.705
- COME ON, NOW,
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T LIKE

13:06.972 --> 13:08.374
WHEN YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT.

13:08.474 --> 13:12.111
- [sighs]
IS HE DOING TIME OR WHAT?

13:12.211 --> 13:14.213
MINE TOO.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.482
MAYBE THEY'RE FRIENDS.

13:16.548 --> 13:18.384
- MAYBE.

13:18.450 --> 13:21.687
- LISTEN, I GOT TO ASK.

13:21.954 --> 13:24.089
- WHAT'S UP?

13:24.156 --> 13:26.659
- MEN OR WOMEN?

13:26.959 --> 13:29.094
- MEN OR WOMEN WHAT?

13:29.194 --> 13:31.196
- BILLY TOLD ME
YOU'RE SHACKING UP WITH A GUY,

13:31.263 --> 13:32.631
BUT I CAN FEEL
YOUR EYES ON ME.

13:32.731 --> 13:34.600
WHICH IS IT...

13:34.667 --> 13:36.602
MEN OR WOMEN?

13:36.669 --> 13:40.572
- YOU ASKING
FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL INTEREST?

13:40.639 --> 13:42.741
- I'M ASKING
'CAUSE GREG'S THE KIND OF GUY

13:43.008 --> 13:44.476
A LOT OF GIRLS
GET STUPID FOR.

13:44.543 --> 13:48.080
- WHO'S GREG?
- OUR WHEELMAN--GREG DYSON.

13:48.147 --> 13:49.515
YOU'LL MEET HIM IN AN HOUR.

13:51.317 --> 13:53.385
- NO, THAT SHOULDN'T BE
A PROBLEM.

13:53.452 --> 13:54.653
- GOOD.

14:00.559 --> 14:01.694
- EXCUSE ME, OFFICER?

14:01.994 --> 14:03.429
MY NAME IS ED SALAZAR.

14:03.529 --> 14:04.963
- DETECTIVE.

14:05.030 --> 14:06.365
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

14:06.432 --> 14:09.001
- MY DAUGHTER FOUND THIS TAPE,
AND IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING,

14:09.068 --> 14:13.439
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE
GETTING MURDERED.

14:13.539 --> 14:16.041
- [chuckles]
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

14:18.544 --> 14:20.679
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GIVE IT A LISTEN.

14:30.155 --> 14:31.223
[cell phone ringing]
- WHOA.

14:31.290 --> 14:33.592
- PARDON ME.
- MY BAD.

14:33.692 --> 14:36.595
[cell phone continues ringing]

14:36.695 --> 14:38.597
[sniffs]

14:38.697 --> 14:39.598
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

14:39.698 --> 14:41.200
- I GOT A MAJOR PROBLEM
RIGHT NOW.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.335
YOU REMEMBER GREG DYSON?
- [sighs]

14:43.435 --> 14:44.470
DYSON...

14:44.570 --> 14:46.472
YEAH, YEAH,
FROM THAT SAN DIEGO BITCH

14:46.572 --> 14:48.073
YOU WORKED A WHILE BACK, RIGHT?

14:48.173 --> 14:49.608
- YEAH, HE'S BEEN ON THE LAM
FOR TWO YEARS.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.343
GUESS WHAT HE'S DOING
FOR WORK THESE DAYS.

14:51.443 --> 14:53.746
- HE'S AMBER'S WHEELMAN.

14:54.046 --> 14:55.314
- IF HE SEES ME,
HE'S GONNA RECOGNIZE ME,

14:55.381 --> 14:57.216
AND SINCE I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO DIDN'T GET ARRESTED

14:57.316 --> 14:58.550
FROM THE CREW--

14:58.617 --> 15:00.486
- YEAH, IT'S NOT GONNA BE
A HAPPY REUNION--I GET IT.

15:00.586 --> 15:02.287
FIND OUT WHAT HE'S DRIVING
AND LET ME KNOW.

15:02.354 --> 15:03.288
I'LL HANDLE IT.

15:03.355 --> 15:04.556
- ALL RIGHT.

15:04.623 --> 15:06.692
HURRY UP.

15:20.005 --> 15:23.208
- OKAY, SO I KNOW YOU'RE
ALL LIKE, "IT'S JUST A HOME,"

15:23.275 --> 15:24.610
BUT LET'S BE REAL.

15:24.676 --> 15:28.614
YOU GOT A FREAKIN' HISTORICAL
MONUMENT IN YOUR BACKYARD.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.083
- IT'S A FRANCISCAN MISSION.
- YEAH.

15:31.150 --> 15:32.985
- MY FATHER SPENT A FORTUNE
RESTORING IT.

15:33.085 --> 15:34.153
- I BET HE DID.

15:34.219 --> 15:36.321
- OF COURSE,
HE'S NEVER ONCE BEEN HERE.

15:36.388 --> 15:38.190
- NO?

15:38.257 --> 15:41.026
SO, IF NO ONE
COMES DOWN HERE...

15:41.093 --> 15:44.596
- WHAT WAS ALL THAT TALK
ABOUT CRUISE SHIPS?

15:44.663 --> 15:47.332
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS WEIRD, RIGHT?

15:47.399 --> 15:48.600
I MEAN, I WAS JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION--

15:48.700 --> 15:50.602
- ARE YOU TRYING TO GET IN BED
WITH MY FATHER?

15:50.669 --> 15:54.606
AM I JUST A MEANS TO AN END?

15:54.673 --> 15:57.242
- NO.

15:57.309 --> 15:58.644
NO.

15:58.744 --> 16:00.979
HEY.

16:01.046 --> 16:03.649
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

16:03.715 --> 16:08.153
I WANT YOU DESPITE YOUR FAMILY,
NOT BECAUSE OF IT.

16:17.963 --> 16:19.698
- I THINK THE REASON
MY FATHER NEVER COMES HERE

16:19.965 --> 16:23.435
IS BECAUSE HE FINDS THE IDEA
OF GOD UNSETTLING.

16:23.502 --> 16:25.437
- SOMEONE WATCHING,

16:25.504 --> 16:27.439
KEEPING SCORE?

16:27.506 --> 16:31.176
- WHEN I WAS YOUNG, THAT WAS
THE PART I LIKED BELIEVING IN.

16:31.243 --> 16:33.045
- SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE
ANYMORE?

16:33.111 --> 16:35.047
- NO.

16:36.248 --> 16:38.350
ONE DAY I LOOKED AROUND
AND REALIZED

16:38.417 --> 16:41.753
THAT EVEN IF I SOMEHOW
MADE IT TO HEAVEN,

16:41.987 --> 16:45.324
I WOULDN'T KNOW ANYONE THERE.

16:45.390 --> 16:47.726
- YOU KNOW ME.

17:05.711 --> 17:08.514
- OFFICER WEST, THE TARGET
WAS SPOTTED HEADING EAST

17:08.580 --> 17:10.282
ON 18TH STREET
TOWARD AVENUE OF THE ARTS

17:10.349 --> 17:12.150
IN A WHITE PORSCHE.

17:12.251 --> 17:14.152
- COPY THAT.

17:33.605 --> 17:37.309
[engine revs]
[tires squealing]

17:42.581 --> 17:47.052
[horns blaring]

19:07.366 --> 19:08.533
HANDS...

19:08.634 --> 19:10.535
SLOW.

19:16.508 --> 19:18.010
- HE'S NOT PICKING UP.

19:18.110 --> 19:20.012
- HE'LL SHOW.

19:23.382 --> 19:24.750
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

19:25.017 --> 19:26.685
- YOU GOT A PLAN "B"?

19:26.985 --> 19:29.154
- [sighs]
ON SHORT NOTICE?

19:29.254 --> 19:32.257
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.
- I GOT A GUY.

19:37.562 --> 19:41.333
- LOOKS LIKE A VAULT.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.335
SAFETY DEPOSITS...

19:45.270 --> 19:46.705
IS THAT OXYHYDROGEN?

19:47.005 --> 19:48.573
- I WASN'T REPAIRING
A FRICKIN' SUBMARINE.

19:48.674 --> 19:50.175
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WORKED?

19:50.275 --> 19:52.044
- I'VE BEEN
MOSTLY LEGIT LATELY,

19:52.144 --> 19:54.012
YOU KNOW, CHAUFFEURING
HOLLYWOOD TYPES.

19:54.112 --> 19:55.714
- DRIVING MISS DAISY OVER HERE.

19:56.014 --> 19:58.150
- AND THAT'S BASICALLY RACISM.

19:58.216 --> 19:59.718
- HOW'S THAT RACIST?
- THAT'S BASICALLY RACISM.

20:00.018 --> 20:01.353
- HOW'S THAT--TELL ME--WHAT?
- YOU CAN'T--

20:01.420 --> 20:02.387
YOU CAN'T NAME
ANOTHER CHAUFFEUR.

20:02.487 --> 20:05.123
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO KEEP
YOU SEPARATED.

20:05.190 --> 20:07.292
[sighs]

20:07.392 --> 20:09.027
ASSUMING IT IS
SAFE DEPOSITS?

20:09.127 --> 20:10.562
- THEN YOU WANT
A LOW-ROOF TRANSIT VAN.

20:10.629 --> 20:13.465
- NO, WHAT WE NEED IS GIDDYUP.
A TRANSIT VAN'S SLOW AS SH--.

20:13.565 --> 20:15.734
- YEAH, THEY'RE SLOW TO DRIVE,
BUT THEY'RE QUICK TO LOAD.

20:16.034 --> 20:18.070
PLUS, YOU STICK SOME DECALS
ON THE SIDE,

20:18.170 --> 20:20.272
IN 90 SECONDS,
YOU'RE A PLUMBER.

20:20.338 --> 20:23.008
- HUH.

20:26.445 --> 20:29.047
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

20:29.114 --> 20:31.216
- RACIST.

20:31.316 --> 20:34.453
- SHUT UP.

20:34.553 --> 20:37.022
- OKAY.

20:46.431 --> 20:48.500
- SH--.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.236
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GOING TO BE HERE.

20:51.336 --> 20:52.604
- I'VE BEEN WAITING.

20:52.671 --> 20:56.108
- YEAH, I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU'D COME VISIT ME.

20:57.743 --> 21:00.645
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD...

21:00.746 --> 21:02.080
YOU KNOW, BEING SO CLOSE

21:02.147 --> 21:04.082
AND NOT BEING ABLE
TO DO ANYTHING.

21:04.149 --> 21:07.085
LIKE, IF WE WERE ANYWHERE ELSE,
ANYWHERE AWAY FROM YOUR FATHER,

21:07.152 --> 21:08.320
YOU KNOW, WE'D BE...

21:08.386 --> 21:11.089
- DO YOU THINK
I'M STUPID, JOHNNY?

21:11.189 --> 21:12.124
HMM?

21:12.190 --> 21:13.258
- NO.

21:13.325 --> 21:15.594
- I MEAN, DO YOU--
YOU THINK I-I CAN'T TELL

21:15.660 --> 21:17.329
WHEN I'M BEING TREATED
LIKE A FOOL?

21:17.429 --> 21:19.331
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:19.397 --> 21:21.199
I JUST WENT FOR A WALK.

21:21.299 --> 21:24.069
I JUST WENT FOR A WALK.
- SHUT UP. SHUT UP.

21:24.136 --> 21:25.137
SHUT UP.

21:25.203 --> 21:27.205
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
MY TIME, MY THING.

21:27.272 --> 21:28.974
- OKAY, OKAY.
- OKAY? HUH?

21:29.074 --> 21:30.242
YOU KNOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME,

21:30.308 --> 21:33.245
MY FATHER WAS ACTUALLY LISTENING
TO ME, REALLY LISTENING,

21:33.311 --> 21:37.983
AND THEN YOU SHOW UP AND YAP
ABOUT SOME STUPID CRUISE SHIPS.

21:38.049 --> 21:39.384
BUT NO.

21:39.484 --> 21:42.220
NO, NO, I'M NOT GONNA LET
TWINK

21:42.420 --> 21:44.356
MEXICO
AND ADVISE MY FATHER.

21:44.422 --> 21:46.625
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

21:46.691 --> 21:48.426
HE ASKED ME A QUESTION.
HE ASKED ME A QUESTION.

21:48.493 --> 21:49.961
I ANSWERED THE QUESTION.

21:50.028 --> 21:52.364
- YOU KNOW, I HAVE EXERCISED

21:52.464 --> 21:56.501
A TYPE OF PATIENCE WITH YOU
THAT I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO.

21:56.601 --> 22:00.372
DO YOU KNOW
WHY THAT IS, HUH?

22:00.438 --> 22:01.706
TELL ME, JOHNNY.

22:01.973 --> 22:04.609
TELL ME, OR I WILL BLOW YOUR
BRAINS ALL OVER THIS BEDROOM.

22:04.676 --> 22:06.478
- BECAUSE YOU WANT ME.

22:06.545 --> 22:08.446
BECAUSE YOU WANT--

22:08.513 --> 22:10.582
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

22:10.649 --> 22:12.517
THAT'S RIGHT.

22:12.584 --> 22:13.752
THAT'S RIGHT, JOHNNY,

22:14.019 --> 22:18.456
BUT THE MOMENT YOU BECOME
AN IMPEDIMENT TO ME...

22:21.126 --> 22:23.728
I WILL LEAVE YOU IN PIECES.

22:23.995 --> 22:25.730
ON EVERYTHING
THAT IS SACRED TO ME,

22:25.997 --> 22:28.200
I SWEAR THAT.

22:35.607 --> 22:38.743
- [breathing heavily]

23:09.174 --> 23:12.110
- [retching]

23:14.179 --> 23:16.114
[coughs]

23:18.450 --> 23:20.385
[spits]

23:22.420 --> 23:24.422
[sighs]

24:25.517 --> 24:28.119
- NO, PLEASE! NO!

24:30.221 --> 24:33.491
[shouting in native language]

24:33.591 --> 24:36.094
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

24:36.194 --> 24:37.162
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:37.228 --> 24:39.230
- [screams]

24:39.297 --> 24:40.632
- [shouting in native language]

24:40.732 --> 24:43.501
- YOU LITTLE BITCH,
I WILL PULL YOUR TEETH OUT!

24:43.601 --> 24:45.270
I WILL PULL YOUR TEETH OUT.
- HEY!

24:45.370 --> 24:46.538
- DO YOU HEAR ME?
YOU THINK YOU'RE CRYING NOW?

24:46.638 --> 24:48.373
- STOP. STOP.

24:48.473 --> 24:51.109
- [crying] I'M SORRY!
PLEASE, YOU HELP ME.

24:51.209 --> 24:52.677
- [laughs]
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DID?

24:52.978 --> 24:55.046
[laughing]
SHE BIT ME.

24:55.113 --> 24:57.115
- MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN NEAR HER MOUTH, THEN.

24:57.182 --> 24:59.150
LINA, GO TO YOUR ROOM.

24:59.217 --> 25:01.019
GO!

25:01.119 --> 25:03.254
- [crying]

25:06.291 --> 25:08.293
- HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED
TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU?

25:08.393 --> 25:12.497
- WHAT'S THAT?
- THEY'RE NOT YOURS.

25:12.564 --> 25:14.232
- LISTEN.

25:14.299 --> 25:16.634
IF I'M GONNA VOUCH
FOR MY MERCHANDISE,

25:16.701 --> 25:18.737
I'M GONNA SAMPLE IT
ONCE IN A WHILE.

25:19.004 --> 25:21.506
- THEY'RE NOT YOUR MERCHANDISE
TO HANDLE.

25:21.573 --> 25:23.975
THEY'RE MINE.

25:24.042 --> 25:25.343
I BOUGHT THEM.

25:25.410 --> 25:27.645
- NO, YOU BOUGHT SHARES.

25:27.712 --> 25:29.247
REMEMBER?

25:29.314 --> 25:31.149
"YEAH,
THEY'RE ON THE LAYAWAY PLAN."

25:31.216 --> 25:32.517
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

25:32.584 --> 25:35.387
SO, UNTIL I'M PAID IN FULL,
THEY'RE STILL MINE.

25:35.487 --> 25:38.289
- IT'S THIS SIMPLE.

25:38.390 --> 25:42.293
YOU VOID THE CONTRACT,
YOU DON'T GET YOUR MONEY.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.629
YOU WANT TO GET
YOUR ROCKS OFF,

25:44.696 --> 25:46.031
GO TO THE BAR AT BENNIGAN'S.

25:46.097 --> 25:49.534
UNTIL THEN, YOU'RE GONNA
RESPECT OUR AGREEMENT.

25:49.601 --> 25:50.568
- OKAY.

25:50.635 --> 25:52.404
- AH!

25:52.470 --> 25:54.005
[groaning]

25:54.072 --> 25:56.541
- I WILL NOT BE THE BITCH
IN MY OWN HOME.

25:56.608 --> 25:59.344
MAKE NO MISTAKE.

26:03.715 --> 26:07.185
[metallic clinking]

26:13.024 --> 26:14.726
- OW.

26:17.295 --> 26:19.631
- YOU'RE UP LATE.

26:19.697 --> 26:24.369
- UH, IT'S--
IT WAS A LONG, LONG NIGHT.

26:24.469 --> 26:29.107
- I SENT CARLOS AND LUCIA
INTO TOWN.

26:29.207 --> 26:32.377
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
SINCE THEY WERE BOTH HOME,

26:32.477 --> 26:35.146
I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE SOUND
OF THEIR BICKERING.

26:35.213 --> 26:37.649
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

26:42.187 --> 26:45.090
- I'M NOT BLIND, YOU KNOW.

26:45.190 --> 26:47.258
- SIR?

26:47.325 --> 26:49.594
- I SEE THE WAY
HE LOOKS AT YOU,

26:49.694 --> 26:52.964
THE WAY HE HONKS ABOUT YOU
LIKE A LITTLE GOOSE.

26:53.064 --> 26:56.334
- IT'S--IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK, SIR.

26:56.434 --> 26:59.637
- HIS MOTHER CODDLED HIM.

26:59.737 --> 27:01.206
SHE GAVE AND GAVE.
