WEBVTT

00:08.060 --> 00:10.000
Ricardo's taken over the cartel.

00:10.020 --> 00:11.160
Killed anyone loyal to Ignacio.

00:14.070 --> 00:16.110
Price is either dead
or on the run.

00:16.130 --> 00:18.030
-Either way I need a new
informant.

00:18.070 --> 00:19.030
-Not interested.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.160
You'll be the only Raven
we'll prosecute.

00:21.180 --> 00:23.100
I need you to shut down
the security business.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.070
-Is it that bad?
-Yes, that bad.

00:25.090 --> 00:27.170
-What the hell you want, Kraley?
-To meet and talk.

00:27.190 --> 00:29.150
-About what?
-  The payday.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.160
I'm with the Department
of Child Services.

00:36.180 --> 00:38.040
I'm taking Dani into state
protection.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.080
There's the court order.

00:40.030 --> 00:42.080
I'm gonna bring you back home.
Promise.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.020
I'm not gonna fight you
over custody.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.070
Why the change of heart?

00:45.090 --> 00:46.220
I guess I'm tired of fighting.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.110
My mother told me
exactly what you did to her.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.010
Say "I raped her."

00:53.030 --> 00:55.010
I raped her. I raped her!

00:55.030 --> 00:56.210
Barry wouldn't want
you in danger,

00:56.230 --> 00:59.130
and that's what will happen
if people know that you saw the

00:59.170 --> 01:00.040
shooting.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.080
Where's my brother?

01:01.100 --> 01:03.070
I'm hearin' there's a witness
to some work I put in,

01:03.090 --> 01:05.030
but your brother
won't tell me who it is.

01:09.030 --> 01:10.070
Help!

01:12.100 --> 01:13.200
Back up.

01:14.190 --> 01:15.200
Just give me a name.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.160
It's me! I'm the witness!

01:22.190 --> 01:25.030
If I can free your father,
what's in it for me?

01:25.050 --> 01:26.110
What are you after?

01:28.100 --> 01:30.140
Get on the ground now!

01:30.160 --> 01:33.140
- So now what?
- We focus on Ricardo.

02:03.030 --> 02:05.160
Whoa-- Asshole!

02:05.180 --> 02:06.180
What the hell, man?!

02:06.200 --> 02:09.220
Oh!

02:17.080 --> 02:19.150
-You want some too,
motherfuckers?

02:19.190 --> 02:20.180
Whoa.

02:23.180 --> 02:26.030
Make a good Raven.

02:26.050 --> 02:28.000
How can we not?

02:56.140 --> 02:58.220
I wish you
coulda been there.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.230
If you could have saw his face--

03:01.010 --> 03:03.150
I mean, he was so scared.

03:11.170 --> 03:13.160
Coffee? Drink?

03:16.210 --> 03:18.150
I thought you'd be a
little  happier.

03:18.170 --> 03:20.050
What do you want from me?

03:20.070 --> 03:22.160
Thank you  so  much
for grabbin' his balls

03:22.180 --> 03:23.230
and squeezin' em hard?

03:24.010 --> 03:26.000
I got him to admit what he did.

03:26.020 --> 03:28.010
He'll never be prosecuted,
will he?

03:29.140 --> 03:31.090
Still got his job, doesn't he?

03:31.110 --> 03:33.220
Still got an ocean of victims
to choose from.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.160
Well, maybe next time
he'll think twice before he

03:35.200 --> 03:36.040
wants--

03:36.060 --> 03:37.130
Save it.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.090
Save it. You're a cop.

03:41.060 --> 03:42.110
You're a woman.

03:43.210 --> 03:46.060
You know there's never
any justice for this.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.210
Cole. Wait up.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.110
Whatever it is,
I don't wanna hear it.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.150
Yeah, you do.

04:03.170 --> 04:06.050
No. I'm out.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.120
I'm done, man.

04:08.150 --> 04:11.190
Bullshit. Now is not the time
to be fuckin' around!

04:11.210 --> 04:13.020
People are dead.

04:14.090 --> 04:15.180
Good people.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.030
Because all we do is stick our
hands out

04:18.070 --> 04:20.010
for payoffs from hood rats!

04:20.210 --> 04:23.010
We protect and serve
the dealers.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.000
We're no better than they are,
man.

04:28.030 --> 04:30.100
I told you I'm workin'
on gettin' us out of that.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.220
Too little, too late.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.200
Because Pastor Greg was the glue
holding this whole neighborhood

04:35.000 --> 04:35.110
together.

04:35.130 --> 04:38.060
-His death is not our fault.
-Yes, it was.

04:40.210 --> 04:43.020
They killed him
because cops like us

04:43.040 --> 04:45.080
will let them get away with it.

04:46.070 --> 04:48.080
Him and Amber,
all they wanted to do...

04:50.090 --> 04:52.040
was help the people around them.

04:54.010 --> 04:56.170
And I don't know what
would have happened between

04:56.210 --> 04:57.060
us...

04:59.070 --> 05:01.070
but I sure as hell
wanted to find out.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.200
What about this
earlier incident?

05:20.220 --> 05:23.210
Uh... what earlier incident?

05:23.230 --> 05:25.090
Two years ago.

05:25.110 --> 05:27.110
Dani's babysitter
didn't meet her after school,

05:27.130 --> 05:29.180
so Dani walked home alone
and was locked out of the

05:29.220 --> 05:30.100
apartment.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.170
I fired her.
Soon as I found out it happened.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.120
Half a point for you.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.160
Fortunately,
your neighbors took care of Dani

05:38.180 --> 05:40.020
until they could track you down,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.130
but anything could
have happened to her.

05:42.150 --> 05:45.090
-None of it good.
-I know that.

05:45.110 --> 05:47.160
That's why I've made sure that
nothing else has ever happened

05:47.200 --> 05:48.030
again.

05:48.050 --> 05:49.150
And it hasn't.

05:49.170 --> 05:51.110
Until armed men
broke into your place.

05:53.130 --> 05:57.020
Look, two incidents trigger
an automatic investigation.

05:58.190 --> 06:01.030
Don't expect to get Dani back
anytime soon.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.120
Shit.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.190
Always at the end of shift.
Never fails.

06:13.210 --> 06:16.020
You got somewhere to be?
Or just tired of being around

06:16.060 --> 06:16.110
me?

06:16.130 --> 06:17.160
Both.

06:19.020 --> 06:20.150
You sold me out.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.060
Why?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.200
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

06:29.030 --> 06:30.170
Can you give us a moment?

06:39.010 --> 06:41.040
You used me...

06:41.060 --> 06:44.110
to get that information
about my father's location.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.010
Yeah.

06:48.030 --> 06:49.130
Of course you did.

06:52.130 --> 06:53.170
And I know why.

06:56.230 --> 06:59.020
I wanna talk to your handler.

07:06.030 --> 07:08.020
All I heard was some shots

07:08.040 --> 07:09.040
and a car drivin' off.

07:09.060 --> 07:11.040
-Nobody saw anything?
-Nah.

07:11.060 --> 07:12.160
-No license plate, no
description?

07:12.200 --> 07:13.100
No.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.140
You don't run out your front
door

07:14.180 --> 07:16.010
when you hear shots around here.

07:16.030 --> 07:19.060
Yeah, you know it was that G.
Wayne, just arrest him.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.110
No evidence, no arrests.
That's how it works.

07:21.130 --> 07:22.180
That's why I'm here.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.110
No, that's how it works

07:24.130 --> 07:25.230
because you cops
don't do nothin'.

07:27.010 --> 07:29.080
What if you could get him
for what he done to Barry?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.170
My boy's the witness
Amber was protecting.

07:35.050 --> 07:36.210
Died protecting.

07:39.150 --> 07:41.100
Barry was like a big brother
to my son.

07:42.190 --> 07:44.040
Tommy wants to come forward.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.230
-He wants to tell what he saw.
-George,

07:47.010 --> 07:48.010
you can't make that
boy a target.

07:48.030 --> 07:50.120
We done the best we could

07:50.140 --> 07:51.190
to raise him right,

07:51.210 --> 07:53.090
and now he's throwing that
back at us.

07:53.110 --> 07:56.170
Askin' is he only supposed
to tell the truth when it's

07:56.210 --> 07:57.060
easy?

07:58.160 --> 08:00.050
I've got no righteous answer
for that.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.100
Look, I'm not here

08:03.120 --> 08:05.090
to lie to you, brother.

08:06.010 --> 08:08.210
Think hard about this...

08:08.230 --> 08:10.140
because we won't be able
to protect him.

08:13.190 --> 08:15.110
- We can.
- And we will.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.110
Nothin's gonna happen to that
boy

08:18.150 --> 08:19.200
if you do your job.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.220
Get that piece of shit
off the streets.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
We'll do the rest.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.100
Go.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.050
I'm alone.

09:05.020 --> 09:06.040
Relax.

09:07.010 --> 09:08.030
Open it.

09:18.020 --> 09:21.020
Can I approach you now
without being shot?

09:23.120 --> 09:25.000
No guns.

09:26.160 --> 09:29.050
Now that you have my attention,

09:29.070 --> 09:31.060
what is it you wanted
to talk about?

09:32.100 --> 09:34.020
You've got my father.

09:35.220 --> 09:37.230
Do you want my brother as well?

09:40.100 --> 09:41.180
I'll hand him to you.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.190
In exchange for...?

09:44.160 --> 09:47.030
I want you to arrange
for my father, if he's

09:47.070 --> 09:47.230
convicted,

09:48.010 --> 09:49.200
to serve his sentence
in Colombia.

09:49.220 --> 09:51.050
Where he'll be immediately
released.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.120
You'll need to think about this.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.200
You can let me know through
Steve

10:01.000 --> 10:01.170
what they decide.

10:17.170 --> 10:19.190
If they don't all go to jail
in the States,

10:19.210 --> 10:21.040
we'll be lookin' over our
shoulders

10:21.080 --> 10:22.110
for the rest of our lives.

10:22.130 --> 10:24.110
No doubt about it.

10:26.110 --> 10:28.060
But what choice do I have?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.080
Arrest Victor, their lawyer.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.000
He knows enough
to take 'em all down.

10:38.190 --> 10:41.050
Your partner's father-in-law?

10:50.060 --> 10:52.000
So...

10:52.020 --> 10:55.020
-you're OK with joint custody.
-Yes.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.210
-And Victor?
-It's not up to him.

10:58.170 --> 11:00.220
My father is owned
by the cartel.

11:01.150 --> 11:03.090
I don't want our daughter
growing up with that.

11:03.110 --> 11:04.210
Then maybe Tito isn't the best
guy

11:05.020 --> 11:06.150
to have in our daughter's life--

11:06.170 --> 11:08.010
That's a decision I'll need to
make,

11:08.050 --> 11:08.150
not you.

11:11.060 --> 11:12.190
I gotta go.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.180
Yeah, um...

11:16.070 --> 11:19.140
I'll have a lawyer tell me
what all this "whereto as"

11:19.160 --> 11:21.130
and "herein afters" mean.

11:22.170 --> 11:24.150
OK.

11:24.170 --> 11:26.140
I'll get back to you, yeah?

11:45.020 --> 11:47.000
Motherfucker's
been all in my spots.

11:47.020 --> 11:49.070
And he killed Pastor Greg?

11:49.090 --> 11:51.150
We gon' bury his ass
with or without your help.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.190
Are you done?

11:53.180 --> 11:55.070
No.

11:55.220 --> 11:57.010
I ain't done.

11:57.030 --> 11:58.110
What, you didn't hear me?

11:58.130 --> 12:01.200
It ain't your problem,
'cause I'ma take care of G.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.050
Do you have any idea
where he is?

12:04.070 --> 12:06.190
If we did,
he'd already be dead.

12:06.210 --> 12:08.090
Listen to me, man.

12:08.110 --> 12:10.230
Because I got his ass
straight slippin'.

12:11.010 --> 12:12.120
I just need to find him.

12:14.010 --> 12:15.190
Put the word out, OK, Clinton?

12:15.210 --> 12:19.030
You mean... you just
gonna arrest his ass?

12:19.050 --> 12:21.100
After he killed your  girl?!

12:28.150 --> 12:29.220
You ain't shit.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.180
Just put the word out, man.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.050
I can't just hand you the money,
Chris.

12:47.090 --> 12:48.130
You gotta clear it with Steve.

12:48.150 --> 12:50.160
I'm not asking for a handout.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.060
I'm asking for a loan.
I'll pay you back.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.200
Still gotta clear it with Steve.

12:58.190 --> 13:00.190
What's it for?

13:00.210 --> 13:03.120
Why?
You gonna lend me some money?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.020
You're puttin' your shit in the
street

13:06.060 --> 13:07.080
by asking for a pension loan,

13:07.100 --> 13:09.210
so don't get irritated at me
if I wanna know why.

13:12.070 --> 13:14.220
DCS is doing a full
investigation on me.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.160
Threatening to keep Dani.

13:18.110 --> 13:19.210
I need a lawyer.

13:19.230 --> 13:21.220
Someone who knows
how to fight these things.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.180
No, you don't.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.200
I'm not gonna do anything crazy.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.210
All that's gonna do is make them
dig in their heels.

13:27.230 --> 13:29.150
Who said anything about crazy?

13:29.170 --> 13:31.050
It's the lazy-ass DCS. They've
got

13:31.090 --> 13:33.040
skeletons piled up in every
corner.

13:33.060 --> 13:36.030
How hard can it be
to find a weak spot to poke?

13:51.070 --> 13:52.190
You don't have to talk.

13:55.090 --> 13:57.050
But I suggest you listen.

14:07.190 --> 14:10.000
OK, here's another one.

14:10.020 --> 14:13.230
Eight-year-old boy.
Step-father beat him to death.

14:14.010 --> 14:15.100
Neighbors called in the possible
abuse

14:15.140 --> 14:16.120
seven separate times,

14:16.140 --> 14:19.160
and the DCS caseworker
assigned to you did nothing.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.220
-How many is that?
-Five.

14:26.020 --> 14:27.200
You gotta step back in, Kraley.

14:27.220 --> 14:29.160
Steve's a shit leader,

14:29.180 --> 14:31.020
and we're tired of being kept in
the dark

14:31.060 --> 14:32.020
about what's going on.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.190
You and Tom  never
treated us like this.

14:33.210 --> 14:35.220
I've made mistakes, I'll admit
it.

14:36.020 --> 14:37.070
But don't we all?

14:37.090 --> 14:38.120
It was no mistake.

14:38.140 --> 14:39.180
Foster should have cleared the
place

14:39.220 --> 14:40.150
like you told him

14:40.170 --> 14:41.180
before grabbing the money.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.070
Don't.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.140
Did you know it was Kraley?

14:49.150 --> 14:51.100
No.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.140
I swear I didn't.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.150
Keep it in your pants, Karen.

15:14.170 --> 15:16.110
Foster knew what he was gettin'
into.

15:31.010 --> 15:32.230
Was it your idea or his?

15:34.030 --> 15:36.050
He was a greedy son of a bitch.

15:37.030 --> 15:39.070
Nobody knows that
better than you.

15:39.090 --> 15:41.020
So why pick Foster?

15:41.220 --> 15:43.140
Why not take one of
these assholes?

15:43.160 --> 15:44.210
Do it yourself?

15:45.140 --> 15:47.040
He was desperate.

15:47.060 --> 15:50.040
Vipers were gonna vote him out
as leader. He--

15:50.060 --> 15:51.120
He needed a win.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.050
So you did him a solid?

15:56.230 --> 16:00.010
Yeah, I gave him the address,
told him to sit on it for a bit.

16:01.010 --> 16:03.000
See how many players
were inside.

16:03.020 --> 16:06.020
Once he got the intel,
I was gonna go in with him.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.220
But he got greedy and rushed it.

16:22.050 --> 16:24.070
Now's not the time...

16:26.160 --> 16:29.090
but you will get what's
coming to you.

16:42.170 --> 16:44.060
Get the fuck off me!

16:48.200 --> 16:50.060
Hey.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.060
It's not like you
to show that much restraint.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.170
You sure you're OK?

16:56.010 --> 16:58.050
Get in.
We're gonna go deal with that

16:58.090 --> 16:58.200
bitch.

16:58.220 --> 17:01.150
-What bitch?
-The DCS woman.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.080
The DEA picked up Victor.
Lourdes isn't answering her

17:30.120 --> 17:30.220
phone.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.160
Victor's gonna testify
against the cartel.

17:34.190 --> 17:36.000
Why would he do that?

17:37.080 --> 17:39.080
Because I told Andrews
he was the one person

17:39.100 --> 17:41.040
that could help take
Carmen down.

17:45.090 --> 17:46.130
You're serious.

17:46.150 --> 17:48.200
They had a case on us, Pete.

17:50.060 --> 17:52.160
It was give up the cartel
or we all go to jail.

17:52.180 --> 17:54.020
So you gave up my family?!

17:57.150 --> 17:59.050
Where are Lourdes and Veronica?

18:00.090 --> 18:01.130
They're in WITSEC.

18:02.070 --> 18:03.090
Victor too.

18:03.110 --> 18:05.090
Witness protection?

18:05.110 --> 18:07.020
They're safer there.

18:08.050 --> 18:10.220
Witness protection?! Why?!

18:11.000 --> 18:13.110
Why'd you give 'em up
without talking to me?!

18:17.000 --> 18:18.180
You better fix this,

18:18.200 --> 18:21.040
or I'll never see my
daughter again.

18:22.140 --> 18:23.160
I can't, man.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.050
It's too late for that.

18:27.070 --> 18:29.050
I did this for all of us.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.010
-Lunchtime's over.
-Who the hell are you?

18:53.030 --> 18:56.000
-I'm her friend.
-We just came to talk.

18:56.020 --> 18:57.230
- For now.
- What are you--

18:58.010 --> 19:01.070
Just setting the mood.
Don't wanna be interrupted.

19:01.090 --> 19:03.190
Now...

19:03.210 --> 19:05.060
from one civil
servant to another--

19:05.080 --> 19:06.210
-This isn't the way it works--
-Shut the fuck up.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.230
I've seen your files.
You've lost as many as you've

19:09.030 --> 19:09.100
saved.

19:10.090 --> 19:11.090
Get out.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.160
I can give the cases you screwed
up

19:17.200 --> 19:18.120
to the press.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.220
Make your personal and
professional life

19:21.020 --> 19:22.040
an absolute hell.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.230
About a handful of these kids
you remove

19:24.010 --> 19:25.190
might survive to see adulthood

19:25.210 --> 19:28.050
with minimal physical
and psychological damage.

19:28.070 --> 19:30.090
And that's the best case.
Am I right?

19:30.110 --> 19:31.170
It's still a hell of a lot
better

19:31.210 --> 19:33.020
than where they came from.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.180
Dani's not one of those kids.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.080
She's got a good home.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.160
A loving home.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.100
Look...

19:39.120 --> 19:41.150
maybe my friend struggles
at being a single parent

19:41.170 --> 19:43.040
and working a full-time job,

19:43.060 --> 19:45.160
but she's still more fit
to care for Dani than strangers

19:45.180 --> 19:48.010
the court's gonna
stick her with.

19:48.030 --> 19:50.040
I won't endanger her again.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.010
I swear.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.010
This is one you're gonna
want to take a chance on.

19:56.220 --> 19:58.200
Trust me on this.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.160
I'm just asking what you hear

20:05.180 --> 20:08.160
when a girl says, "No."

20:08.180 --> 20:10.210
Depends how she says it.

20:10.230 --> 20:12.100
"No."

20:14.010 --> 20:15.210
"No?"

20:15.230 --> 20:18.100
"Nooooooo."

20:18.120 --> 20:20.110
It's interesting that

20:20.130 --> 20:22.070
no matter what topic I've
prepared,

20:22.110 --> 20:23.170
the discussion always

20:23.190 --> 20:27.050
twists around to the minefield
of sexual desire.

20:27.070 --> 20:29.040
So, OK, let's go there again.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.090
You say you hear the tone,
but not the word.

20:31.110 --> 20:33.180
So if you consider where she--

20:50.160 --> 20:52.140
Professor Everett
had a little accident the other

20:52.180 --> 20:53.000
day.

20:54.180 --> 20:56.170
He's probably still in a bit of
pain,

20:56.210 --> 20:57.200
but here he is,

20:57.220 --> 21:00.010
helping you navigate
the gender wars.

21:01.050 --> 21:02.190
-He's a selfless guy.
-I don't think it's

21:02.230 --> 21:03.140
appropriate--

21:03.160 --> 21:05.050
Step back and shut up.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.110
This is his cover.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.090
And his hunting ground.

21:17.110 --> 21:21.080
You, the women sitting here...

21:21.100 --> 21:22.200
you're his prey.

21:22.220 --> 21:25.050
-Stop--
-Please, touch me and give me an

21:25.090 --> 21:25.200
excuse.

21:38.180 --> 21:40.180
Is there anyone in this class

21:40.200 --> 21:43.120
who's had an uncomfortable
experience with him?

21:43.140 --> 21:45.090
Anyone?

21:48.040 --> 21:53.030
Um, I think maybe I--
I misunderstood what he meant.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.230
So, I-- I don't know if he...
really--

21:59.000 --> 22:00.080
I hear shame.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.230
You're  ashamed.

22:04.140 --> 22:06.210
But that doesn't belong on you.
It's his.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.100
I am here to paint him in it,

22:10.120 --> 22:13.230
to drown him in it,
to rip off his mask.

22:18.090 --> 22:20.210
This is what a smart
predator looks like.

22:22.090 --> 22:25.220
He talks a good game,
he gaslights you--

22:26.000 --> 22:27.200
he makes you think
you misunderstood his

22:28.000 --> 22:28.150
intentions,

22:28.170 --> 22:30.150
while all he's doing is thinking
about

22:30.190 --> 22:32.140
how he can get you to  fuck  him.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.060
Or to watch him jerk off.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.140
Or whatever his sickness is.

22:37.180 --> 22:39.120
How many of these girls
have you tried it on?

22:43.150 --> 22:45.140
Seven students
and one faculty member

22:45.160 --> 22:47.030
have filed complaints against
him

22:47.070 --> 22:48.070
with the university,

22:48.090 --> 22:51.050
but here he still stands. Safe.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.180
Because this school
does  nothing.

22:55.170 --> 22:57.120
You know what I'd like to see?

22:58.110 --> 23:02.060
All of you, in unison...

23:02.080 --> 23:05.120
going to whatever passes
as human resources in this dump

23:05.140 --> 23:08.050
and asking who thought it
was a good idea

23:08.070 --> 23:10.130
to hire a  rapist

23:10.150 --> 23:12.180
to teach gender studies.

23:14.130 --> 23:16.090
Shame him.

23:17.070 --> 23:19.050
Shame  them.

23:20.110 --> 23:23.210
Get. Him. Fired.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.100
Thanks.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.190
They were all filming you.

24:02.210 --> 24:04.140
Yeah?

24:06.230 --> 24:08.010
Gonna get in trouble?

24:10.030 --> 24:11.050
Probably.

24:17.050 --> 24:18.200
Why'd you do it?

24:21.220 --> 24:24.170
For them...

24:25.180 --> 24:27.040
and for us.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.150
-Hello?
-Pete.

25:15.170 --> 25:18.150
Lourdes. Where you at?

25:18.170 --> 25:20.050
I'm not sure.

25:21.190 --> 25:23.180
-Is Veronica OK?
-  Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.100
She's with me.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.080
-So's my father.
-  Listen to me.

25:27.100 --> 25:28.190
Your father's making a
huge mistake--

25:31.010 --> 25:33.190
Lourdes, he's endangering
both you and my daughter by

25:33.230 --> 25:34.140
doing this.

25:35.230 --> 25:37.010
He has no choice.

25:37.030 --> 25:39.000
He didn't want this.
Neither did I.

25:41.220 --> 25:43.110
I'm sorry, Pete.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.140
I really am.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.180
Don't do this, Lourdes!

25:48.150 --> 25:50.190
At least let me say goodbye!

25:52.140 --> 25:54.180
Just tell me where you're at.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.090
Come here! Bring your ass!

26:11.100 --> 26:13.030
Come on! Come on!

26:13.230 --> 26:16.160
Get your ass down!
Get your ass on the ground!

26:16.180 --> 26:17.220
Do it!

26:20.140 --> 26:22.210
I ain't goin' in.
So you got a decision you gotta

26:23.010 --> 26:23.090
make.

26:23.110 --> 26:26.150
Either you let me go,
or you pull the damn trigger!

26:38.090 --> 26:39.170
Reach for your shit.

26:39.190 --> 26:41.070
Come on.

26:41.090 --> 26:43.030
Maybe it'll be your lucky day.

26:43.050 --> 26:45.100
Huh? Come on.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.080
Man, fuck you.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.040
If I go to jail,
ain't none of yours is safe.

26:49.060 --> 26:51.090
Get your hands up! Turn around!

26:51.110 --> 26:53.130
Cuff him. Get the gun!

26:53.150 --> 26:55.110
You heard what I said.

26:55.130 --> 26:57.140
People gonna die if you do this.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.140
How badly you want Victor back?

27:35.180 --> 27:37.000
Where is he?

27:37.020 --> 27:39.080
The DEA has him under witness

27:39.120 --> 27:40.020
protection.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.110
He's gonna testify against you.

27:42.130 --> 27:45.200
If I can bring him to you,
I want assurances.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.010
Just assurances?

27:49.030 --> 27:50.090
This isn't about money.

27:51.050 --> 27:52.160
Is Steve next to you?

27:54.020 --> 27:55.040
No.

27:56.010 --> 27:58.080
He doesn't know I'm calling you,
and it needs to stay that way.

27:58.100 --> 28:01.220
OK. This will be our
little secret.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.100
When can you bring Victor to me?

28:04.120 --> 28:06.060
So I have you and your brother's
word

28:06.100 --> 28:07.070
this ends there?

28:07.090 --> 28:09.120
No other retaliation
on my family?

28:10.160 --> 28:12.030
You have our word.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.080
Victor's life for theirs.

29:12.140 --> 29:14.180
Hey, asshole, come here.
I got some good news.

29:20.180 --> 29:22.210
Made a friend over at City Hall.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.090
And?

29:26.110 --> 29:28.060
He's in charge of issuing
building permits,

29:28.080 --> 29:29.160
and he's a
pay-to-play kind of guy.

29:29.180 --> 29:31.140
We're out of the security
business, Carl.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.220
No, we're not. Look.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.140
You were right.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.160
With all the heat, we need to
find a way

29:36.200 --> 29:38.010
to earn legitimately.

29:38.030 --> 29:40.110
-This is it.
-Givin' this guy kickbacks for

29:40.150 --> 29:41.050
contracts

29:41.070 --> 29:43.130
-ain't legitimate.
-No, maybe not.

29:43.150 --> 29:45.050
But it's less liability
than dealing with the cartel.

29:45.070 --> 29:47.020
Fine, do you what you gotta do.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.110
What the hell's goin' on here?!

29:49.130 --> 29:51.090
I was a founding fucking member
of this shit.

29:51.130 --> 29:52.140
I got a right to know.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.200
It's the Feds again?

29:53.220 --> 29:55.100
Keep your voice down.

29:57.090 --> 29:59.220
-It's the DEA.
-Son of a bitch.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.120
-I got it handled.
-Do you?

30:05.230 --> 30:07.150
They're not comin' after the
club.

30:07.190 --> 30:08.200
It's me they want.

30:08.220 --> 30:12.070
I'm the only one that goes down,
so keep your mouth shut about

30:12.110 --> 30:12.170
it.

30:13.230 --> 30:16.100
So you're gonna give
up the cartel?

30:16.120 --> 30:19.160
Yeah, that's a dumb play, Steve.
Real dumb.

30:19.180 --> 30:20.140
Chances are the Feds, they're
not

30:20.180 --> 30:21.190
gonna stick to the deal they
made.

30:21.210 --> 30:23.040
And even if they do, the
cartel's

30:23.080 --> 30:24.190
gonna be gunning for retaliation

30:24.210 --> 30:26.230
against all of us, not just you!

30:27.010 --> 30:29.050
Not if I sweep 'em all up
in the indictment.

30:29.070 --> 30:32.180
Get 'em all at once.
It's the only option I have.

30:33.210 --> 30:36.070
Better we just let the Feds
try and build a case on us.

30:36.090 --> 30:38.070
Half the shit won't stick--
it never does.

30:38.090 --> 30:41.190
I'm tired, man.

30:41.210 --> 30:44.100
Even if I saw a way out,
I don't know that I'd take it.

31:07.130 --> 31:10.060
Try to get away or yell,
I'll put you down right here.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.000
Nod if you understand.

31:12.230 --> 31:15.230
Walk back.

31:16.230 --> 31:18.150
-Put your hands behind your
back.

31:18.190 --> 31:19.020
-OK.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.120
-What are you doing, Pete?
-Shh.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.210
Move.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.090
So what's your plan, Pete? Huh?

31:49.110 --> 31:51.170
-You do have one?
-Shut up!

31:52.230 --> 31:54.090
If you wanted me dead,

31:54.110 --> 31:57.010
you could have easily
shot me back there.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.200
But you don't have the
spine for that.

31:59.220 --> 32:02.160
You made a stupid choice
that put my family in danger.

32:02.180 --> 32:04.130
So did you.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.190
I've known you for a long time,
Pete.

32:08.210 --> 32:11.050
If you do this...

32:11.070 --> 32:14.120
my blood's on your hand
whether you pull the trigger or

32:14.160 --> 32:14.230
not.

32:15.010 --> 32:16.090
At every goddamn turn,

32:16.110 --> 32:18.110
all you've ever done
is try separating me from my

32:18.150 --> 32:19.000
family.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.080
And now you're putting
them in danger!

32:21.100 --> 32:23.160
All because of shit
that you got us into

32:23.180 --> 32:25.110
by getting the
cartel to help us.

32:25.130 --> 32:27.230
So tell me again
why I'm not gonna do this.

32:28.010 --> 32:31.000
Just listen to yourself, Pete.

32:31.020 --> 32:34.040
It's not me you're
trying to convince.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.200
I'm doing this for my daughter.

32:37.220 --> 32:40.070
So was I.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.180
Easy.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.200
What'd you do?

34:01.230 --> 34:03.000
Nothing.

34:04.140 --> 34:05.190
Carmen called me.

34:07.050 --> 34:08.160
I couldn't do it.

34:10.020 --> 34:12.030
I wanted to, but I
couldn't do it.

34:17.060 --> 34:18.080
How bad is it?

34:19.170 --> 34:21.110
It's hard to tell, man.

34:23.090 --> 34:25.080
Carmen wants to meet.

34:25.100 --> 34:27.060
With both of us.

34:30.030 --> 34:33.050
Well, if she wants to talk...
tell her come and get me.

34:34.150 --> 34:36.060
If they come,
it won't be to talk.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.110
Go ahead.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.180
Carmen's at her place,
and she's expecting me.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.040
If you're gonna take them down,
do it now.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.220
You're sure her  and  Ricardo
are both inside?

35:06.130 --> 35:08.230
If they're not,
we're all fucked.

35:14.030 --> 35:15.050
Go.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.170
Clear.

35:51.060 --> 35:52.090
Clear.

35:57.190 --> 35:59.130
-Clear!
-Clear!

36:00.040 --> 36:01.080
Clear!

36:07.130 --> 36:09.010
Code 4.

36:09.030 --> 36:11.030
Location is secure.

36:11.050 --> 36:12.220
Any of the primaries in custody?

36:13.190 --> 36:15.070
Negative.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.100
Yeah.

37:02.210 --> 37:04.120
Karen, there's something
you should know.

37:05.150 --> 37:07.070
The cartel's gunning for us.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.070
I already talked to Ramos.

37:12.170 --> 37:13.190
I'm sorry.

37:15.150 --> 37:18.090
When we first got into
this thing...

37:18.110 --> 37:20.050
we were like a family.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.120
How many secrets have you
been keeping from me?

37:24.140 --> 37:26.010
From us?

37:28.130 --> 37:29.230
You had no right, Steve.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.200
I gave up Victor to
protect all of us.

37:33.180 --> 37:35.010
I had no choice.

37:37.180 --> 37:39.220
There's always a choice.

37:41.070 --> 37:43.080
You just keep making
the wrong ones.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.090
I love you too. You're my world.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.030
We are gathered here today...

39:22.050 --> 39:26.000
to mourn the passing
of two individuals...

39:26.020 --> 39:30.160
whose lives have touched us all.

39:30.180 --> 39:33.030
In our time of grief,

39:33.050 --> 39:36.130
it is only natural
for us to wonder why

39:36.150 --> 39:39.040
and gain understanding
right now.

39:39.060 --> 39:41.230
But I'm here to remind you

39:42.010 --> 39:46.090
to trust in the Lord your God
with all your hearts...

39:46.110 --> 39:48.190
and to not lean into
your own understanding.

40:16.020 --> 40:19.010
I think you're a good guy,
Foster, but...

40:19.030 --> 40:21.100
I'm the driver. Not you.

40:31.090 --> 40:32.230
- Hello?
- Mom.

40:33.010 --> 40:34.040
You around?

40:34.060 --> 40:35.220
Why, what's up?

40:36.160 --> 40:38.080
Feel like some company?

40:38.100 --> 40:40.100
That would be kinda nice.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.190
Karen?

40:51.020 --> 40:52.140
Karen! Are you there?

40:57.050 --> 40:58.130
Shit.

41:00.060 --> 41:01.120
Karen!
