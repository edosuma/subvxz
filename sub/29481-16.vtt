WEBVTT

00:02.379 --> 00:04.720
I'm not saying I don't
appreciate what you did,

00:04.805 --> 00:06.648
- because I do. I just wish...
- No, I get it.

00:06.733 --> 00:08.234
I went too far.

00:08.525 --> 00:10.195
Just a little.

00:10.632 --> 00:11.640
I was just trying to...

00:11.725 --> 00:13.578
Give me all the things
you never had.

00:13.663 --> 00:14.789
Yeah.

00:15.181 --> 00:18.228
Well, in retrospect,
I guess having Lizzo sing

00:18.313 --> 00:20.773
"Happy Birthday" to you
was a tad much.

00:20.857 --> 00:24.193
Well, don't get me
wrong... she was great.

00:24.277 --> 00:25.194
Yeah.

00:25.278 --> 00:26.609
But I just don't want

00:26.694 --> 00:29.023
everyone to think
I'm a spoiled brat.

00:31.410 --> 00:33.161
I want to accomplish things
on my own.

00:33.411 --> 00:35.496
Oh, I know you do.

00:36.031 --> 00:37.164
So listen.

00:37.248 --> 00:40.334
From now on, why don't we try
to focus on enjoying

00:40.418 --> 00:42.054
the simple things,

00:42.270 --> 00:44.647
like making pizza
and watching a movie?

00:44.779 --> 00:47.240
Sounds great.

00:48.593 --> 00:50.261
After I go for a run.

00:50.345 --> 00:52.406
Oh, come on.
You can't take the day off?

00:52.491 --> 00:54.720
I can't.
Tennis season starts soon.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.098
And I want to be number one.

02:04.035 --> 02:06.627
We got a call from a witness
about 45 minutes ago.

02:06.712 --> 02:07.896
He was walking his dog.

02:07.981 --> 02:09.226
He saw a man dragging
a young woman

02:09.310 --> 02:10.728
into a car
and then drive off.

02:10.812 --> 02:12.046
Did he get a good look
at the vehicle?

02:12.130 --> 02:13.445
He said it was
a small gray sedan.

02:13.529 --> 02:14.663
That's all he remembered.

02:14.748 --> 02:16.271
- What about the suspect?
- Male.

02:16.356 --> 02:18.201
White. Mid-40s.
Had a gun in his hand.

02:18.326 --> 02:19.577
What about the girl
that was grabbed?

02:19.661 --> 02:21.643
- What do we know about her?
- Name's Chloe Ford.

02:21.728 --> 02:25.764
Female, white, 16 years of age.
Father's a billionaire.

02:25.876 --> 02:27.795
Guessing that's the reason
she got grabbed.

02:29.193 --> 02:31.076
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

02:31.398 --> 02:33.942
Yeah, we have two security
cameras on top of the gate.

02:34.027 --> 02:36.111
One on the left.
One on the right.

02:36.196 --> 02:38.530
They already told my house
manager to pull the video,

02:38.615 --> 02:40.454
so you should have access
to that any minute now.

02:40.538 --> 02:42.456
- Thank you.
- Mr. Ford.

02:42.540 --> 02:44.319
Do you have any idea who may be
responsible for this?

02:44.403 --> 02:47.919
- No, I have... I have no idea.
- What about your wife?

02:48.004 --> 02:49.482
Is she here?
Maybe she...

02:49.584 --> 02:51.623
No, she passed away
three years ago.

02:51.907 --> 02:53.459
Sorry to hear that.

02:54.290 --> 02:56.475
Has Chloe been having
any problems in school?

02:56.723 --> 03:00.334
Maybe enemies or stalkers?
Jealous ex-boyfriends?

03:00.419 --> 03:02.559
No.
And she would tell me, too.

03:02.644 --> 03:05.818
We're close... we talk
all the time about everything.

03:06.341 --> 03:07.811
What about you,
Mr. Ford?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.080
Anything unusual
going on in your life?

03:09.164 --> 03:10.514
Have there been
any recent threats,

03:10.598 --> 03:11.973
or do you have any enemies?

03:12.122 --> 03:14.363
Well, I buy and sell
companies.

03:14.544 --> 03:17.157
I shut down factories.
I consolidate business units.

03:17.241 --> 03:18.396
So a lot of enemies.

03:18.481 --> 03:20.232
Yeah, but they're
business enemies.

03:20.351 --> 03:23.479
They might hope I, you know,
go broke or get cancer,

03:23.665 --> 03:25.858
but I can't imagine any of them
doing something like this.

03:25.942 --> 03:27.655
Okay.
If you think of anything

03:27.740 --> 03:29.998
that's helpful,
please let us know right away.

03:30.159 --> 03:34.178
Uh, by the way, I just talked
to the Assistant Director,

03:34.270 --> 03:35.522
and he assured me
his best agents

03:35.606 --> 03:36.981
would be on this case

03:37.068 --> 03:38.511
and they would do
everything possible

03:38.596 --> 03:40.990
to make sure
they get my daughter back.

03:41.933 --> 03:44.091
The Assistant Director's
absolutely right, sir.

03:48.055 --> 03:49.566
All right, come on in folks.

03:49.651 --> 03:51.652
Chloe Ford.
16 years of age.

03:51.818 --> 03:54.269
She's been missing
for 56 minutes.

03:54.354 --> 03:55.629
Every second that passes,

03:55.714 --> 03:57.530
the odds
of finding her decreases.

03:57.615 --> 03:59.051
Yes, yes, so,
Chloe is a junior

03:59.136 --> 04:00.629
at the Trinity School
in Manhattan.

04:00.714 --> 04:03.605
Her father, Nathan,
founder of Crestford Capital

04:03.690 --> 04:06.776
is number 230
on the Forbes 400 list.

04:06.861 --> 04:09.810
As for the case, the victim
was abducted outside the gates

04:09.895 --> 04:12.122
of the family's country
home in Bedford.

04:12.207 --> 04:13.811
I have surveillance footage
from the crime scene.

04:13.895 --> 04:16.048
Okay, great. First eyes.
Check it out.

04:16.134 --> 04:19.005
It's not
the best angle, but...

04:23.881 --> 04:25.090
All right, all right,
we have a...

04:25.174 --> 04:26.537
What is that,
gray Ford Fusion?

04:26.622 --> 04:28.093
Want to zoom and
get those plates?

04:28.177 --> 04:29.536
Elise, you want to run those?

04:29.621 --> 04:34.044
Registered to Abigail Porter,
32, lives in New Rochelle.

04:34.183 --> 04:36.727
Car was reported stolen
at gunpoint 90 minutes ago.

04:36.811 --> 04:38.604
Okay, and the canvas
gets some paint.

04:38.688 --> 04:41.357
So the perp carjacks the Ford
in New Rochelle,

04:41.441 --> 04:43.859
drives to Bedford,
then abducts Chloe.

04:43.943 --> 04:46.570
You guys want to track down
this Abigail Porter,

04:46.654 --> 04:49.156
see if she has
any workable details?

04:49.240 --> 04:50.783
And what else do we know
about Chloe Ford?

04:50.867 --> 04:53.118
Ran her emails and texts.
Nothing too interesting.

04:53.202 --> 04:56.747
Lots of talk about school,
tennis, boys.

04:56.831 --> 04:58.123
Keep working.
What about the father?

04:58.207 --> 04:59.958
Nothing too intriguing
there either.

05:00.042 --> 05:02.568
Mostly business chatter.
Lots of Wall Street jargon.

05:02.669 --> 05:05.130
"Cash flow,"
"P/E," "EBITDA."

05:05.214 --> 05:07.383
So the question remains...
Why Chloe?

05:07.467 --> 05:09.301
She is not the only rich kid
in New York.

05:09.385 --> 05:13.305
Is there something specific
about her? Her father?

05:13.389 --> 05:14.638
This does not seem random.

05:14.723 --> 05:15.947
Was this a money grab,

05:16.032 --> 05:17.686
or is there
something else going on here?

05:17.771 --> 05:19.811
You know, it might not be
relevant to the case,

05:19.896 --> 05:21.967
but the Fords have been
in the news a lot lately,

05:22.052 --> 05:23.607
and not in a good way.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.776
- What do you mean?
- Well, apparently Nathan

05:25.860 --> 05:28.487
threw a $2 million
birthday party for Chloe.

05:28.571 --> 05:30.787
Went viral on social media.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.749
Blogs and news outlets
picked it up.

05:33.076 --> 05:36.161
And put a target
on poor Chloe's head.

05:36.245 --> 05:37.329
Right.

05:41.876 --> 05:44.128
I was stopped at that
stop sign,

05:44.373 --> 05:46.702
um, when this guy
opened my door,

05:46.787 --> 05:49.216
pointed a gun at me,
and told me to get out.

05:49.649 --> 05:52.359
- You get a good look at him?
- Sort of.

05:52.678 --> 05:55.180
Most of my attention
was on that gun he was holding.

05:55.264 --> 05:58.350
But he's definitely white.
About 40, maybe 45.

05:58.434 --> 06:03.063
Average height, I think.
And his hair was brown.

06:03.287 --> 06:05.525
Any scars? Tattoos?

06:06.382 --> 06:07.865
Not that I noticed.

06:08.611 --> 06:10.863
- He have any type of accent?
- No.

06:11.029 --> 06:13.365
He sounded normal,
like he was from New York.

06:13.449 --> 06:16.693
Weird thing is,
he was nice.

06:17.017 --> 06:18.309
Nice?

06:18.621 --> 06:21.331
He kept saying, "I'm sorry.

06:21.505 --> 06:23.084
"I don't have a choice.

06:23.169 --> 06:25.154
I'm only doing this
because of my daughter."

06:32.844 --> 06:34.591
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah?

06:34.676 --> 06:36.561
I've been looking over
that street pod footage

06:36.646 --> 06:37.890
from the carjacking.

06:37.974 --> 06:39.141
- Can you see the perp's face?
- Yeah.

06:39.225 --> 06:40.726
I got a hit on facial rec, too.

06:40.810 --> 06:42.060
All right, all right.
Eyes up.

06:42.144 --> 06:43.604
Guy's name is Mike Helton.

06:43.688 --> 06:46.356
He's 46 years old.
Lives in Queens. No priors.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.608
Works in and out
of construction

06:47.692 --> 06:49.401
and served
seven years in the Army.

06:49.485 --> 06:50.861
Do we have a cell
phone number?

06:50.945 --> 06:53.071
We do, but he turned it off
three hours ago.

06:53.155 --> 06:54.740
Huh.

06:54.824 --> 06:56.909
The car looks new.
Try to access its GPS system.

06:56.993 --> 06:58.578
Yeah.
Hold on.

07:05.835 --> 07:07.419
Okay. Got something.

07:07.503 --> 07:10.047
Looks like it's parked
outside a house in Scarsdale.

07:10.131 --> 07:12.090
Address is 321 Flag Street,

07:12.174 --> 07:14.426
and the property owner's name

07:14.510 --> 07:17.638
is the Henry Kirkendall
Family Trust.

07:17.722 --> 07:19.473
Who the hell
is Henry Kirkendall?

07:21.203 --> 07:24.456
The CEO of a real estate firm
based in Manhattan.

07:24.643 --> 07:26.894
- Any connection to Helton?
- I'm looking.

07:29.984 --> 07:32.162
Okay, nothing's popping up,
but I'll keep digging.

07:32.418 --> 07:33.794
All right.
Call Maggie and SWAT.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.420
Get them over to that
Scarsdale address right away.

07:35.504 --> 07:36.656
Yep.

07:43.747 --> 07:45.943
Go, go, go.

07:46.542 --> 07:48.627
Okay, you two are with me.

07:48.711 --> 07:51.060
- On the vehicle.
- What's your six?

07:51.145 --> 07:52.730
Trunk.

07:54.529 --> 07:55.446
Clear.

07:55.531 --> 07:57.093
I'm clear.
He's clear.

07:57.178 --> 07:58.804
Go.

07:58.888 --> 08:00.264
- On to the house.
- Sure.

08:00.348 --> 08:02.808
Huddle up. Let's go.

08:02.892 --> 08:05.435
Hold.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.020
Stand by.

08:07.104 --> 08:09.439
Weapons green.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.935
Door's open.

08:12.276 --> 08:14.152
- Green, go, go, go.
- Go!

08:15.404 --> 08:17.447
All right, split, split.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.866
Clear left.

08:18.950 --> 08:20.117
B-team, top side.

08:20.201 --> 08:22.119
Walsh, take the stairs.

08:22.203 --> 08:23.996
Alpha team, on the stairs.
On me.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.330
Go, go, go.

08:26.958 --> 08:29.334
- To the left.
- All clear.

08:49.712 --> 08:51.380
<i>Scola, is there
any activity upstairs?</i>

08:51.465 --> 08:53.007
<i>Negative-
second level's clear.</i>

08:53.092 --> 08:55.469
<i>- Headed downstairs now.</i>
- Where the hell is this guy?

08:55.561 --> 08:57.772
There's a ton of property,
but it's freezing outside.

08:57.857 --> 08:59.279
Five degrees with the wind.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.282
All, right.
We'll set up a containment.

09:01.367 --> 09:02.910
Guys, let's rally
in the entryway.

09:02.995 --> 09:04.954
Secure in the rear.

09:05.146 --> 09:06.355
Main floor.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.373
Reconvene down low.

09:08.457 --> 09:12.068
<i>How you doing, FBI?
Glad you're here.</i>

09:12.153 --> 09:15.349
<i>Got here really fast, too,
even faster than I thought,</i>

09:15.434 --> 09:19.373
<i>which proves my point...
Justice is only for the rich.</i>

09:19.520 --> 09:21.438
<i>I mean, you grab
a billionaire's daughter,</i>

09:21.523 --> 09:24.091
<i>the cops find her
in two hours and 49 minutes.</i>

09:24.176 --> 09:25.942
<i>But when you grab a poor
person's daughter,</i>

09:26.027 --> 09:27.146
<i>you don't even look</i>

09:27.256 --> 09:29.174
<i>or return
the father's phone calls.</i>

09:29.599 --> 09:31.551
<i>So I did what I had to do.</i>

09:31.771 --> 09:34.179
<i>I grabbed a rich kid
to get your attention.</i>

09:34.505 --> 09:37.182
<i>So here's the deal, guys.
It's pretty simple, actually.</i>

09:37.630 --> 09:39.976
<i>You find my daughter,
the rich kid lives.</i>

09:40.130 --> 09:42.412
<i>You don't, she dies.</i>

09:47.817 --> 09:49.514
All right. Come on boy.
Let's find this lunatic.

09:49.598 --> 09:52.614
Come on... give you a nice piece
of fillet mignon if you deliver.

09:52.698 --> 09:53.615
Okay, come on.

10:07.378 --> 10:08.560
All right, good work, buddy.

10:08.645 --> 10:11.396
We got a hit!
Hidden door.

10:12.676 --> 10:13.677
Stand by.

10:13.794 --> 10:15.429
Pull it back.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.270
Reinforced steel.

10:22.519 --> 10:24.145
That thing
isn't gonna make a dent.

10:24.229 --> 10:25.789
<i>Oh, no, no, no,
you'll be there all month</i>

10:25.873 --> 10:27.148
<i>trying to break down
that door.</i>

10:27.232 --> 10:29.780
<i>So you're gonna be tempted
to get creative...</i>

10:29.865 --> 10:30.983
<i>Try to get in some other way.</i>

10:31.067 --> 10:33.576
<i>But if you even try,
I'll kill the girl.</i>

10:33.661 --> 10:34.786
<i>Say hi, Chloe.</i>

10:34.871 --> 10:37.081
<i>Let the FBI know
you're doing okay.</i>

10:37.197 --> 10:40.084
<i>- Go on.
- Hhi. th-this is Chloe.</i>

10:40.169 --> 10:44.685
<i>I'm... I'm okay, but...
I'm scared.</i>

10:45.419 --> 10:49.029
<i>Like I said, if you find
my daughter, I won't hurt he.</i>

10:49.114 --> 10:50.740
<i>But the clock
is ticking, guys.</i>

10:50.825 --> 10:53.959
<i>You have exactly two hours
and 49 minutes.</i>

10:54.123 --> 10:55.569
<i>You found Chloe that fast.</i>

10:55.654 --> 10:59.529
<i>No reason you can't find
my daughter that fast!</i>

11:02.412 --> 11:05.514
So I spoke with the property
owner, Henry Kirkendall.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.757
He and his wife are in London.
Have been for the last month.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.496
But they do say
they know Helton.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.290
He worked for them
as a handyman.

11:11.374 --> 11:13.245
It's probably how he knows
so much about the safe room.

11:13.329 --> 11:16.212
Yeah, they said Helton helped
out on the construction of it.

11:16.296 --> 11:17.377
Huh.

11:17.487 --> 11:19.114
Okay, what else
did they say about Helton?

11:19.198 --> 11:20.979
Is he mentally ill?
An addict?

11:21.081 --> 11:22.737
No.
He said Helton's a good man.

11:22.822 --> 11:24.299
In fact, I think
the exact quote was,

11:24.384 --> 11:27.220
"He's one of the most loyal
and honest men I've ever met."

11:28.986 --> 11:30.515
All right,
track down the architect

11:30.600 --> 11:31.979
who designed the safe room

11:32.064 --> 11:33.455
and get copies
of the blueprints.

11:33.540 --> 11:34.869
We need to find
a way to breach.

11:34.954 --> 11:35.955
Okay.

11:37.307 --> 11:39.339
So Helton tried to file

11:39.423 --> 11:41.341
a missing-persons report
three weeks ago.

11:41.425 --> 11:44.177
Said his 16-year-old daughter
Stephanie left the home

11:44.261 --> 11:46.305
around 7:00 p.m.
and never returned home.

11:46.389 --> 11:48.140
What do you mean tried?

11:48.224 --> 11:49.850
Well, in order to file
a report

11:49.934 --> 11:52.352
about a missing daughter,
she has to actually exist.

11:52.436 --> 11:54.292
There's no record of Helton
having a daughter,

11:54.377 --> 11:56.075
and police checked the birth
certificate of the girl

11:56.159 --> 11:58.483
he alleged went missing,
Stephanie Rice.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.526
He's not listed as the father.

12:00.903 --> 12:02.893
So what else do we know
about Stephanie?

12:02.999 --> 12:05.245
She was born in New Jersey.
Both parents deceased.

12:05.330 --> 12:06.465
No official address.

12:06.550 --> 12:08.316
And she doesn't appear to be
attending school

12:08.401 --> 12:10.776
at the moment either... at least
there's no record of it.

12:10.861 --> 12:13.026
Do we know if she was
actually living with Helton?

12:13.111 --> 12:14.708
Yeah.
It appears that way.

12:14.792 --> 12:17.210
Two neighbors
told police officers on site

12:17.294 --> 12:19.136
that Helton has been living
with a teenage girl

12:19.221 --> 12:20.547
for about six months.

12:20.631 --> 12:21.916
Okay, so maybe she was
a hostage

12:22.001 --> 12:23.494
or an underage girlfriend.

12:23.675 --> 12:24.838
It doesn't matter.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.987
If Helton believes he's
the father, that's his reality.

12:27.071 --> 12:29.416
Needs to be ours, too.
Meaning?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.557
Meaning our job
is to save Chloe Ford.

12:31.642 --> 12:33.060
Right now the best way
to do that

12:33.144 --> 12:34.895
is to comply
with Helton's mandate.

12:34.979 --> 12:38.190
Which means we have to find
his missing imaginary daughter

12:38.274 --> 12:39.399
wherever she may be.

12:39.483 --> 12:40.546
All right.
I'll call Maggie and OA,

12:40.630 --> 12:41.951
have them take
the lead on this.

12:42.036 --> 12:44.196
Okay. In the meantime,
head over to the scene.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.739
I want you to take the lead
with Helton.

12:45.823 --> 12:47.741
Talk to him.
Keep him calm.

12:47.825 --> 12:50.725
Do anything in your power
to keep him from hurting Chloe.

12:51.430 --> 12:52.388
Okay.
Right.

12:52.496 --> 12:54.415
You got the job?
Yep.

12:57.668 --> 12:59.461
- It's for the dog.
- What?

12:59.545 --> 13:01.649
I promised him a fillet
if he found the perp.

13:01.734 --> 13:02.718
Deal's a deal, right?

13:02.803 --> 13:05.764
Just, uh, you know,
get him something good.

13:05.919 --> 13:09.297
All right, we now have
a visual inside the safe room.

13:12.176 --> 13:14.094
Okay.
So how do I talk to him?

13:14.179 --> 13:15.597
I tap a few keys.

13:15.682 --> 13:18.142
Mic is on.
Just press and talk.

13:18.227 --> 13:20.395
I tap a few more, it's off.
Same with the video.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.800
If we want him to see us,
he will.

13:21.984 --> 13:23.652
If we don't, he won't.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.933
We now have full control
of what he sees and hears.

13:26.018 --> 13:27.261
Yeah?
Okay, great.

13:27.346 --> 13:30.316
So we can see and hear him.

13:30.401 --> 13:32.722
But can he still see
and hear us?

13:34.737 --> 13:36.655
Not anymore.
Just cut his feed.

13:46.646 --> 13:48.314
<i>You guys cut the video, huh?</i>

13:48.422 --> 13:50.298
<i>That some sort
of strategic move?</i>

13:50.554 --> 13:51.972
<i>You guys gonna
blow up the wall?</i>

13:52.056 --> 13:53.682
I already told you guys

13:53.766 --> 13:56.143
if you attempt to break in
here., it's gonna end badly.

13:56.227 --> 13:57.436
Mr. Helton.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.813
This is Special Agent
Jubal Valentine.

13:59.897 --> 14:01.509
I'm here to talk,
to listen,

14:01.594 --> 14:03.859
<i>and to tell you that
we are doing everything we can</i>

14:03.943 --> 14:05.580
<i>to find your missing daughter.</i>

14:05.860 --> 14:09.905
But the most important thing
right now, Mike, is trust.

14:09.990 --> 14:12.259
<i>And we understand
why you did what you did.</i>

14:12.576 --> 14:15.056
<i>Because you're a father and
you weren't getting anywhere</i>

14:15.141 --> 14:16.391
<i>with the police department.</i>

14:16.641 --> 14:18.095
But all of that is in the past.

14:18.374 --> 14:20.960
There's nothing we can do
to change any of that.

14:24.964 --> 14:26.840
Okay, so,
Agent Valentine,

14:26.924 --> 14:30.094
why don't you tell me
about the present?

14:31.428 --> 14:34.514
In the present,
we have dozens of FBI agents

14:34.598 --> 14:36.391
that are searching
for Stephanie,

14:36.476 --> 14:38.578
but we... we do need your help.

14:40.497 --> 14:42.540
All right, uh...

14:42.625 --> 14:45.252
what I know is...

14:45.429 --> 14:48.735
she walked out the door three
weeks ago about 7:00 p.m.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.312
<i>Said she was going
to the store,</i>

14:50.464 --> 14:52.591
<i>and she never came back.</i>

14:52.723 --> 14:56.273
And then I've been looking
for her all by myself

14:56.358 --> 14:58.601
for the last three weeks
'cause no one will believe me.

14:58.686 --> 15:00.813
Okay, again, Mike,
that's yesterday's news.

15:00.898 --> 15:03.149
The FBI are officially
taking over the case.

15:03.234 --> 15:04.382
<i>So things will be different.</i>

15:04.467 --> 15:07.945
Once we start,
we do not stop no matter what.

15:11.276 --> 15:13.361
So why don't you just open
the door and let Chloe go?

15:13.929 --> 15:16.556
Because her father
wants her back as badly

15:16.640 --> 15:18.225
as you want your daughter back,

15:18.309 --> 15:20.644
<i>and she's got nothing to do
with any of this.</i>

15:20.728 --> 15:21.843
No, I can't do that,

15:21.928 --> 15:24.540
because if I do, you'll stop
looking for Stephanie

15:24.648 --> 15:26.858
and tell me that I'm crazy,
that she ran away from me.

15:26.942 --> 15:27.929
<i>No.
No, no, no.</i>

15:28.014 --> 15:30.557
We are... we are committed
to finding Stephanie.

15:30.946 --> 15:32.948
But you holding Chloe hostage,

15:33.032 --> 15:35.575
that's just eating up
FBI resources

15:35.659 --> 15:38.411
that could be dedicated
to finding your daughter.

15:38.495 --> 15:40.580
No.
Nice try, Valentine.

15:40.664 --> 15:44.376
You've got two hours and 21
minutes to find my daughter,

15:44.460 --> 15:46.850
because if you don't,
I'll kill Chloe.

15:46.935 --> 15:48.060
I have no choice.

15:48.145 --> 15:51.091
I'll just kill her
to prove a damn point.

15:53.176 --> 15:56.428
<i>All right? So no more
junior-high psychobabble</i>

15:56.513 --> 15:58.890
or friendly chatter, okay?

15:58.974 --> 16:00.308
Just find my daughter.

16:07.078 --> 16:09.413
I can't believe Mike
took that girl hostage.

16:09.497 --> 16:11.582
He's not perfect.
But he's a good tenant.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.952
Did his best
to raise his daughter right.

16:14.084 --> 16:15.794
Yeah, about that,
we checked.

16:15.879 --> 16:17.588
According to records,

16:17.672 --> 16:19.256
Mike doesn't
actually have a daughter.

16:19.340 --> 16:20.466
Yes. He does.

16:20.550 --> 16:22.135
What are you talking about?

16:22.846 --> 16:24.555
Her mom died last year,

16:24.640 --> 16:26.388
but before she did,
she told Mike

16:26.472 --> 16:28.608
that he was
Stephanie's biological father.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.976
The guy Stephanie thought
was her real dad died

16:31.060 --> 16:32.616
of a drug overdose years ago.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.952
Okay, so the mom realizes
that she's dying.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.606
So she contacts Mike

16:36.691 --> 16:38.776
and makes him promise
to take care of Stephanie?

16:38.860 --> 16:40.898
Yeah, and he stepped up.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.423
- Is this Stephanie's bedroom?
- Yes.

16:46.536 --> 16:48.162
What was their
relationship like?

16:48.247 --> 16:49.351
It wasn't great.

16:49.463 --> 16:51.456
I mean, they didn't even know
each other

16:51.541 --> 16:53.114
until six months ago.

16:53.199 --> 16:56.911
Not to mention, Stephanie's 16,
has had a hard road.

16:57.170 --> 16:59.588
Uh, can you be more specific?

16:59.737 --> 17:02.299
They were driving
each other crazy.

17:02.383 --> 17:04.300
Mike was being
really overprotective,

17:04.385 --> 17:06.428
and Stephanie was starting
to rebel.

17:06.512 --> 17:08.472
- Did Mike tell you that?
- No.

17:08.556 --> 17:11.392
Stephanie did.
We used to talk a lot.

17:12.644 --> 17:15.104
Okay, so according
to your conversations,

17:15.188 --> 17:18.023
do you think it's possible
that Stephanie ran away?

17:26.026 --> 17:27.532
Okay, Anna?

17:27.617 --> 17:29.159
If you know something more,

17:29.243 --> 17:30.661
you've got to tell us
the truth,

17:30.745 --> 17:33.163
because right now there's
a girl being held hostage

17:33.247 --> 17:35.833
because Mike believes
that his daughter was taken,

17:35.917 --> 17:38.127
and he doesn't think
the police give a damn.

17:38.211 --> 17:42.089
So, please, tell us
what you know.

17:42.173 --> 17:45.050
About a month ago,
they had a huge fight.

17:45.134 --> 17:48.137
Mike thought she was
smoking pot and doing drugs,

17:48.221 --> 17:51.765
so he grounded her for a month,
and she went nuts.

17:51.849 --> 17:53.642
I felt really bad for her.

17:53.726 --> 17:56.145
Okay. So...

18:00.108 --> 18:01.400
So I gave her money

18:01.484 --> 18:04.153
so that she can buy
a bus ticket to Florida.

18:04.237 --> 18:06.572
She wanted to go down there
and visit a cousin and stay

18:06.656 --> 18:09.533
until things cooled down
between her and Mike.

18:09.617 --> 18:11.493
You didn't tell Mike
any this?

18:11.577 --> 18:13.412
No, I just gave her the money

18:13.496 --> 18:16.416
for the bus ticket and thought
everything would be okay.

18:22.562 --> 18:23.896
Hey.

18:23.981 --> 18:26.268
Uh, we have video from
the Queens Village Bus Station.

18:26.353 --> 18:28.469
It shows Stephanie buying
a ticket to Fort Lauderdale

18:28.553 --> 18:29.729
three weeks ago.

18:29.845 --> 18:32.869
So Stephanie, Helton's real
daughter, ran away to Florida?

18:33.019 --> 18:35.109
- Not so sure about that.
- What do you mean?

18:35.194 --> 18:36.706
We talked to the cousin
in Fort Lauderdale.

18:36.790 --> 18:39.312
She confirmed that Stephanie
and Helton were having issues

18:39.397 --> 18:40.628
and she wanted to get away
for a few weeks,

18:40.712 --> 18:42.129
but she never showed up.

18:42.436 --> 18:43.854
And the cousin
didn't tell anyone?

18:43.939 --> 18:45.023
Didn't call the police?

18:45.108 --> 18:46.481
Yeah, well, she claimed
that she got a text message

18:46.565 --> 18:48.271
the same day that Stephanie
was supposed to arrive,

18:48.355 --> 18:49.643
saying that things back home

18:49.735 --> 18:50.902
were better
between her and Helton,

18:50.986 --> 18:52.559
so she was going
to stay put in New York.

18:52.643 --> 18:54.841
But she didn't.
She never made it back home.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.009
So what the hell
happened to her?

18:56.093 --> 18:58.303
Did she meet some stranger
and sail off into the sunset?

18:58.387 --> 19:00.847
I pulled all 911 calls
from within a few miles

19:00.931 --> 19:02.140
of the bus station
on the same night

19:02.224 --> 19:03.350
Stephanie was leaving.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.852
At 7:45 p.m., an anonymous call

19:05.936 --> 19:08.105
came in from a passenger
on a bus to Boston.

19:08.189 --> 19:10.190
He said he saw a man fighting
with a white woman

19:10.274 --> 19:11.483
outside the station.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.151
I did a little bit
more digging,

19:13.235 --> 19:15.571
and I found the dash cam
footage

19:15.656 --> 19:18.409
from the bus the 911 call
came from.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.537
I ran it through forensic
software to clean it up.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.332
It's definitely Stephanie Rice.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.168
Well she's definitely not
sailing off into the sunset.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.838
Okay, so maybe
this guy, the abductor,

19:32.922 --> 19:35.841
sent a text to the cousin
to buy some time

19:35.925 --> 19:37.551
so no one
would start looking for.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.178
Yeah, get that footage over
to Jubal ASAP.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.555
Helton's deadline
is quickly approaching.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.473
Maybe this'll buy us some time.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.312
So he really has a daughter.

19:49.396 --> 19:52.983
That's good news, right?
It means he's not crazy.

19:53.067 --> 19:56.737
No, but he's holding
a teenage girl hostage,

19:56.821 --> 19:58.363
so I'm not ready
to ring that bell yet.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.658
But, yeah, at least we know
he's not totally delusional.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.077
Put me through.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.664
Mike, I have news.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.417
<i>We found video from the
Queens Village Bus Station.</i>

20:10.501 --> 20:13.879
<i>Shows a man pulling Stephanie
into a car.</i>

20:13.963 --> 20:16.673
<i>So you were right,
and I am sorry</i>

20:16.757 --> 20:18.717
<i>the responding officers
doubted you.</i>

20:18.801 --> 20:21.386
But like I said earlier,
that's all different now.

20:21.470 --> 20:25.682
We've taken over, and we are
going to find your daughter.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.393
But we need more time.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.145
<i>She's been missing
for three weeks now.</i>

20:30.229 --> 20:32.230
<i>That makes things
more challenging.</i>

20:32.314 --> 20:33.899
Hell of a speech, Valentine.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.193
But how do I know
you're telling the truth?

20:38.487 --> 20:40.280
Send him a screenshot.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.534
Look at your
video screen, Mike.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.251
That's her.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.962
That's my Stephanie.

20:57.798 --> 21:01.092
Who's... who's that guy?
Who took her?

21:01.176 --> 21:02.302
<i>We don't know.</i>

21:02.386 --> 21:04.262
We're looking
into it as we speak.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.916
Okay, do that.

21:06.001 --> 21:08.266
And, uh, since you're
actually trying,

21:08.350 --> 21:10.977
I'll give you...
I'll give you three more hours.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.230
Look, I really don't want
to put a clock on this.

21:13.314 --> 21:14.564
It might take more time.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.650
<i>No, no, no.
Three more hours.</i>

21:16.734 --> 21:18.276
Mike.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.778
<i>You got to work with us here.</i>
No.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.280
No, I don't got
to do nothing, okay?

21:22.364 --> 21:24.241
I've been begging the police
to get involved

21:24.325 --> 21:25.784
for three weeks now!

21:25.868 --> 21:27.410
And they just laughed at me!

21:27.494 --> 21:30.080
<i>They laughed!
They said I was crazy, that...</i>

21:30.164 --> 21:31.957
<i>That my daughter
didn't even exist,</i>

21:32.041 --> 21:35.460
<i>and if she did, she ran away
and that I abused her.</i>

21:35.544 --> 21:38.296
<i>And you thought so, too.
I can hear it in your voice.</i>

21:38.380 --> 21:41.675
<i>So I'm not going to waste
any more damn time, okay?</i>

21:41.759 --> 21:43.427
<i>Three hours!</i>

21:45.429 --> 21:47.305
Put up a clock.

22:00.909 --> 22:02.410
So this man took my daughter

22:02.494 --> 22:04.204
because someone
took his daughter?

22:04.288 --> 22:06.871
- That's correct.
- Okay.

22:06.956 --> 22:08.333
Then I'll pay him,
whatever he wants.

22:08.417 --> 22:11.336
Giving him any sort
of financial incentive

22:11.420 --> 22:13.713
at this point is a bad idea.

22:13.797 --> 22:16.049
He's angry...
Angry at the establishment,

22:16.133 --> 22:16.987
at the police.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.378
He thinks we only care
about the wealthy.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.448
So giving him money
seems like the wrong approach.

22:21.533 --> 22:23.425
All right, can you at least
let me speak to him?

22:23.510 --> 22:24.752
Father to father.

22:24.837 --> 22:27.448
Maybe I can find some
common ground with this guy.

22:29.354 --> 22:30.800
- It's just too dangerous.
- Oh, okay.

22:30.884 --> 22:34.387
So what's your plan, huh?
Waiting around?

22:34.526 --> 22:36.778
Hoping this maniac
just finds religion

22:36.862 --> 22:39.239
and lets my daughter walk free?

22:39.323 --> 22:40.971
No, sir.

22:41.165 --> 22:42.333
We're working on something

22:42.418 --> 22:44.210
a little more proactive
than that.

22:47.119 --> 22:48.578
We've built 12 of these
so far

22:48.678 --> 22:50.888
at a cost of $2 million
per room.

22:51.042 --> 22:52.501
So this room is
an exact replica

22:52.586 --> 22:54.337
of the one you built
for the Kirkendalls?

22:54.422 --> 22:56.744
It is... with the exception
of the furnishings, of course.

22:56.829 --> 22:59.299
And what are the weaknesses?
Breach points?

22:59.468 --> 23:01.690
Well, there aren't any.
That's the whole idea.

23:01.775 --> 23:04.388
The walls are cement,
reinforced with metal rods

23:04.473 --> 23:06.641
every 12 inches.

23:06.725 --> 23:08.435
So the only way to get in

23:08.519 --> 23:10.478
once it's locked
is to physically break in.

23:10.562 --> 23:11.605
Yes.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.975
What about the ceiling?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.346
Is that reinforced
with steel rods, too?

23:17.486 --> 23:18.611
It's an option we offer,

23:18.695 --> 23:20.613
but most people think
it's overkill,

23:20.697 --> 23:21.990
including the Kirkendalls.

23:24.159 --> 23:26.411
So, in your opinion,
that's the best access point,

23:26.495 --> 23:28.621
the ceiling?

23:28.705 --> 23:32.737
We could run a breach charge,
rappel into the room.

23:32.822 --> 23:34.002
All right.

23:34.087 --> 23:35.838
You mind if we ran
a few practice drills?

23:35.923 --> 23:38.508
Well, sir, this model cost us
a lot of money.

23:38.593 --> 23:40.673
I can't just allow you to...
Just give us the number.

23:40.838 --> 23:43.549
FBI will write you a check.

23:54.231 --> 23:56.107
Suspect down.

23:56.191 --> 23:57.317
All right.

23:57.401 --> 23:59.403
What was the timing
on that one?

24:00.615 --> 24:02.366
12 seconds.

24:02.739 --> 24:03.971
That's as fast
as we can move.

24:04.056 --> 24:06.474
- Isn't fast enough.
- She's right.

24:06.594 --> 24:07.956
I mean, the flashbang
disorients me,

24:08.040 --> 24:10.286
but there's still enough time
for me to get a few shots off.

24:10.370 --> 24:11.839
The bottom line is,
we'll take him out,

24:11.923 --> 24:13.175
but he's gonna get off
a few shots.

24:13.259 --> 24:15.330
Now, whether those are
gonna be at us or the girl

24:15.415 --> 24:17.026
is unclear.

24:17.111 --> 24:19.196
We need a bigger distraction.

24:20.183 --> 24:22.634
So what if we cut the lights
while blasting loud music?

24:22.719 --> 24:24.220
He wouldn't be able to see
in the dark

24:24.305 --> 24:26.220
or hear your movements
over the noise.

24:26.305 --> 24:28.166
That'd probably give us
a few extra seconds.

24:28.251 --> 24:31.893
But the chance for success
is still about 50/50.

24:31.977 --> 24:34.604
- Not great odds.
- No.

24:34.688 --> 24:37.691
Not when you're talking
about life and death.

24:38.488 --> 24:40.073
Hey, hey.

24:40.158 --> 24:42.565
I think Chloe slipped free
from the zip ties.

24:42.650 --> 24:44.443
What?

24:44.799 --> 24:46.955
What is she doing?

24:47.040 --> 24:48.799
No, that's not...

24:48.884 --> 24:50.969
that's not good.

24:51.454 --> 24:52.924
Hey, Mike.
It's Agent Valentine.

24:53.009 --> 24:54.428
I just want
to give you a quick update.

24:54.512 --> 24:57.291
I think we are very close
to finding your daughter.

24:57.513 --> 24:58.893
<i>How close?</i>

24:58.978 --> 25:01.104
Well, I'm gonna need
about an hour or so,

25:01.189 --> 25:03.065
<i>but I just wanted
to keep you in the loop.</i>

25:03.391 --> 25:05.047
<i>The smartest thing
for everybody to do</i>

25:05.135 --> 25:05.927
is to stay patient.

25:06.011 --> 25:07.713
We will find Stephanie,

25:07.798 --> 25:10.041
and you will release Chloe
just like you promised, right?

25:10.126 --> 25:11.418
Damn right I will.

25:11.674 --> 25:12.948
The second you find
my daughter,

25:13.033 --> 25:15.076
I'll open that door,
and I'll let Chloe walk.

25:15.190 --> 25:17.608
But I need proof.
Real proof.

25:17.693 --> 25:19.346
You'll definitely get that.
All right?

25:19.483 --> 25:21.073
So let's just all stay calm.

25:21.166 --> 25:22.959
<i>We do not want this
to turn into...</i>

25:23.044 --> 25:24.713
No, Chloe, Chloe!

25:34.659 --> 25:37.786
- No, don't! Don't do it.
- Please.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.922
<i>You shoot her, we stop lookig
for your daughter.</i>

25:43.704 --> 25:46.479
She's just
an innocent kid, Mike.

25:46.564 --> 25:48.857
<i>It's not her fault
you're in this situation.</i>

25:48.942 --> 25:51.194
<i>So put the gun down.</i>

25:52.849 --> 25:54.291
You think I want to hurt her?

25:54.376 --> 25:56.419
<i>No.
No, I don't.</i>

25:56.504 --> 25:58.362
Of course I don't.

25:58.626 --> 26:01.420
She's someone's daughter.
I know that.

26:01.592 --> 26:03.244
Put the gun down.
And you know what?

26:03.329 --> 26:05.612
Let her go,
because if you do that,

26:05.696 --> 26:08.490
I promise you, we will continue
to do everything

26:08.574 --> 26:09.795
we can to find your daughter.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.840
<i>You have my word on that.</i>

26:12.181 --> 26:13.599
I'm losing my mind,
Valentine,

26:13.684 --> 26:15.748
but I'm not stupid.

26:15.985 --> 26:18.904
I let the kid go...

26:19.543 --> 26:20.627
it's over.

26:24.858 --> 26:27.527
You have 47 minutes left,
so please...

26:30.387 --> 26:32.263
Please...

26:32.347 --> 26:34.849
just do what you got to do
and find my daughter.

26:43.098 --> 26:45.766
I just talked to Jubal.
This is getting bad.

26:45.850 --> 26:47.310
Chloe just tried
to attack Helton.

26:47.394 --> 26:50.396
- I admire the pluck.
- Easy way to get killed.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.106
We need to find
his daughter and fast.

26:52.190 --> 26:53.774
I don't see any other way
to resolve this

26:53.858 --> 26:55.735
without
the risk of serious injury.

26:55.819 --> 26:57.236
I've been playing around
with the dash cam footage.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.905
Got an enlarged image
of the car

26:58.989 --> 27:01.657
Stephanie was dragged into
and reconstruct the pixels

27:01.741 --> 27:02.894
around the windshield

27:02.979 --> 27:05.410
to get a better look
at that parking permit.

27:06.652 --> 27:08.332
Off that I got
a partial serial number.

27:08.498 --> 27:09.496
Only a partial?

27:09.581 --> 27:10.966
All because of the make
and year of the car.

27:11.050 --> 27:12.082
That's all I needed.

27:12.167 --> 27:14.652
It was registered
to an Alfonso Gomez.

27:14.763 --> 27:16.027
He lives in Brooklyn.

27:16.112 --> 27:18.692
He's obviously not a physical
match to our subject,

27:18.777 --> 27:20.603
but the car is definitely
registered to him.

27:20.719 --> 27:21.629
All right,
get that information

27:21.714 --> 27:23.036
over to Maggie and OA
right away.

27:23.121 --> 27:24.636
On it.

27:24.721 --> 27:26.058
I sold that car
about a month ago

27:26.143 --> 27:27.716
to a kid named Sergio.

27:27.801 --> 27:29.558
He rented a room off me.

27:30.061 --> 27:32.438
Caught him smoking meth
in my place.

27:32.522 --> 27:33.996
Kicked his ass
out the same day.

27:34.119 --> 27:36.137
- I got no time for junkies.
- Okay, sir.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.754
It's really important
that we find him.

27:37.839 --> 27:39.731
So is there anybody else
in this building who knows him?

27:39.815 --> 27:41.001
You need to speak to him
that bad,

27:41.085 --> 27:42.377
wait up front for a bit.

27:42.469 --> 27:44.883
He'll probably show up
in about an hour or so.

27:45.405 --> 27:46.655
He will? Why?

27:46.740 --> 27:48.617
He keeps a pigeon coop
up on the roof.

27:48.872 --> 27:50.957
I figure it's good therapy
for him.

27:51.041 --> 27:53.000
So I haven't put a stop to it.

27:53.084 --> 27:55.836
Who knows?
Might help them beat the drugs.

27:55.920 --> 27:56.920
Hmm.

27:59.648 --> 28:01.399
Why kind of guy
plays with pigeons?

28:01.490 --> 28:03.325
Apparently the kind that
does a lot of meth

28:03.590 --> 28:05.283
and kidnaps kids
from bus stations.

28:05.368 --> 28:07.802
You know, I know the NYPD
tries their hardest,

28:07.887 --> 28:08.712
but how the hell

28:08.797 --> 28:10.245
did they let this case
slip through the cracks?

28:10.329 --> 28:12.814
They investigated.
They just didn't see any evidence.

28:13.062 --> 28:15.314
Her father kept calling
and calling.

28:15.484 --> 28:17.735
You think they blew this off
because he was poor?

28:17.984 --> 28:20.068
No, but I think
if he were rich,

28:20.153 --> 28:22.197
there's no way in hell
this would have happened.

28:22.392 --> 28:25.243
Nathan Ford spoke directly
to the ADAC.

28:25.353 --> 28:26.845
I mean, just the way it is.

28:26.930 --> 28:30.197
Hey, OA?
I think that's Sergio.

28:33.270 --> 28:35.251
Hey, Sergio, FBI.
We need to talk.

28:53.978 --> 28:55.896
It's clear.

28:55.980 --> 28:58.357
Okay, it's got to be one
of these two apartments.

29:06.128 --> 29:08.713
FBI. Has anyone entered
your apartment?

29:08.993 --> 29:10.271
No.

29:10.395 --> 29:12.035
My partner needs to take
a look right now.

29:12.247 --> 29:13.831
Be my guest.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.147
It's clear.

29:20.317 --> 29:21.734
Shut the door.

29:22.204 --> 29:24.459
- Ready?
- Hit it.

29:28.309 --> 29:30.602
Drop the knife.
Leave me alone.

29:30.741 --> 29:32.284
Come any closer,
I'll cut her.

29:32.517 --> 29:34.018
You don't have a move
here, Sergio.

29:34.102 --> 29:36.270
Don't make this worse
than it needs to be.

29:36.361 --> 29:38.607
Okay, we just want to talk.
Let her go.

29:38.802 --> 29:40.138
Sergio,
I will shoot you!

29:40.223 --> 29:41.348
Don't do this.

29:47.474 --> 29:49.350
- I got him. Take her.
- Yeah.

29:52.162 --> 29:55.039
He's on the fire escape,
headed for the roof.

30:19.681 --> 30:21.224
Hey. Freeze!

30:23.163 --> 30:24.581
Hey, hey!
Stop!

30:47.894 --> 30:49.008
Help me.

30:49.093 --> 30:50.637
Help me!

30:53.134 --> 30:55.479
Where's Stephanie?
Where did you take her?

30:55.583 --> 30:57.209
What?
Pull me up!

30:57.294 --> 30:59.646
Answer my question,
or I'm letting go.

31:01.896 --> 31:05.122
Pull me up, please!

31:05.207 --> 31:06.875
Where is she?
Where is Stephanie?

31:06.960 --> 31:08.794
Stephanie?
Which one is she?

31:08.995 --> 31:11.294
You took her from
a bus station three weeks ago.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.757
I don't remember.
I grab a lot from that place.

31:13.842 --> 31:14.909
Pull me up, please!

31:17.606 --> 31:19.357
Please, pull me up!

31:19.442 --> 31:21.485
Argh! Pull me up!
Please!

31:26.297 --> 31:27.789
Tell me where
those girls are.

31:27.874 --> 31:29.751
Every single one,
or I will throw you

31:29.836 --> 31:31.375
back off this roof myself!

31:33.664 --> 31:36.578
Look. I'm not a bad person,
I swear.

31:36.663 --> 31:39.643
I just needed the money...
for dope.

31:39.822 --> 31:41.313
And these girls,
they ain't no saints.

31:41.398 --> 31:42.741
I know 'cause I talk
to 'em first

31:42.825 --> 31:44.118
to see where their heads
are at...

31:44.202 --> 31:46.234
If they had family,
if they'd be looked for.

31:46.319 --> 31:47.516
And if they did have family,

31:47.601 --> 31:49.024
you would send
some fake text messages

31:49.108 --> 31:50.525
so no one would call the cops.

31:50.610 --> 31:52.528
Can't get caught
if people ain't looking.

31:52.613 --> 31:54.657
So, what, after you steal
these girls from bus stations,

31:54.741 --> 31:56.159
then what?

31:56.244 --> 31:57.548
You just sell them
to the highest bidder?

31:57.632 --> 32:01.383
No.
Only to this dude, Hugo.

32:01.943 --> 32:04.688
He gets 'em hooked
and then puts 'em to work.

32:05.296 --> 32:07.381
You know, sex work.

32:07.793 --> 32:08.920
Where'd Hugo keep
these girls?

32:09.004 --> 32:09.742
I don't know.

32:09.827 --> 32:12.531
Well, you're gonna help us
find out right now.

32:12.665 --> 32:14.164
Do you have his number
on this phone?

32:14.249 --> 32:16.709
No. We don't communicate
like that.

32:16.794 --> 32:19.254
Hugo's paranoid
about using cell phones.

32:19.603 --> 32:21.414
So how do you communicate,
smoke signals?

32:21.499 --> 32:23.594
Same way Pablo Escobar
used to...

32:26.202 --> 32:27.578
Pigeons.

32:30.205 --> 32:32.305
<i>I'm sorry, Chloe.
I didn't mean to hurt you.</i>

32:32.390 --> 32:33.906
<i>I...</i>

32:33.991 --> 32:35.784
<i>just reacted.</i>

32:35.869 --> 32:38.788
<i>- Why do you hate me so much?
- I don't.</i>

32:39.155 --> 32:40.573
<i>I just needed someone rich</i>

32:40.657 --> 32:42.659
<i>so the police would pay
attention.</i>

32:44.036 --> 32:47.789
You heard about
my birthday party, didn't you?

32:47.873 --> 32:50.584
Yeah, read all about it.

32:53.087 --> 32:55.880
Sounded like it was pretty fun.

32:55.964 --> 32:57.007
Are you really gonna kill me

32:57.091 --> 33:00.427
if they don't find
your daughter?

33:00.511 --> 33:03.138
I got no choice.

33:03.222 --> 33:04.932
Sure you do.

33:06.683 --> 33:07.559
But I don't.

33:07.643 --> 33:09.978
I got to let the world know
how unfair this is

33:10.062 --> 33:13.064
so it doesn't happen again
to some other father.

33:13.148 --> 33:15.025
I know you're listening,
Valentine.

33:15.109 --> 33:17.444
<i>Maybe you could help us out
with all this</i>

33:17.528 --> 33:20.864
<i>and tell me
where my daughter is?</i>

33:20.948 --> 33:22.949
Hey, Mike.

33:23.033 --> 33:25.160
Uh, yeah,
we are still doing our best,

33:25.244 --> 33:27.078
but we have not found her yet.

33:27.162 --> 33:29.330
What the hell
are you talking about?

33:29.414 --> 33:31.833
<i>We just nailed down her
location</i>

33:31.917 --> 33:34.002
<i>about five minutes ago,
but we have agents</i>

33:34.086 --> 33:36.838
<i>heading up to Hartford
to pick her up.</i>

33:36.922 --> 33:39.382
<i>Hartford? She's in Hartfor?
With who?</i>

33:39.466 --> 33:41.176
Well, we're still
looking into that.

33:41.260 --> 33:43.637
But, uh, Mike,
I got good news...

33:45.097 --> 33:46.222
We know she's alive.

33:50.519 --> 33:52.812
If you're lying to me,
Valentine...

33:52.896 --> 33:54.689
<i>I'm not.</i>

33:54.773 --> 33:56.316
You have my word.

34:02.948 --> 34:05.366
Apparently homing pigeons
only fly one way.

34:05.450 --> 34:08.161
So the ones in this pen,
when released into the air,

34:08.245 --> 34:11.206
should fly directly to wherever
Hugo originally housed them.

34:14.458 --> 34:15.918
Good to go?

34:21.300 --> 34:22.766
Okay.

34:22.851 --> 34:25.335
The second that bird lands,
we should have an address...

34:25.422 --> 34:27.523
Hopefully the location
of Helton's daughter.

34:33.217 --> 34:35.217
Come on.

34:35.647 --> 34:37.065
Up, up.

34:39.163 --> 34:40.831
I'll stand by.

34:41.279 --> 34:45.074
- Get back.
- Stay.

34:48.429 --> 34:51.000
- Federal agents!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:54.498 --> 34:55.958
<i>Fan out! Let's go!</i>

34:56.043 --> 34:58.795
Trailer's up!

34:58.879 --> 35:00.046
I got two!

35:02.998 --> 35:04.624
It's okay.
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

35:04.709 --> 35:06.296
We're with the FBI.
We're here to help you.

35:06.380 --> 35:08.124
- Where's Stephanie?
- She's over there.

35:08.209 --> 35:09.694
She's sick.

35:10.181 --> 35:11.723
<i>Okay, sir!</i>

35:22.676 --> 35:24.970
Maggie, I need
some Narcan, now.

35:26.365 --> 35:27.772
Is she gonna make it?

35:27.919 --> 35:30.460
I'm not sure.
Doctors say she's septic.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.341
Her body
is starting to shut down.

35:32.496 --> 35:34.956
<i>Okay, Valentine,
time is officially up.</i>

35:35.040 --> 35:37.998
- I got to go.
<i>- No more extensions,</i>

35:38.083 --> 35:40.233
<i>no more dancing,
no more lying.</i>

35:40.427 --> 35:42.570
- <i>I need proof my daughter's alive.</i>
- Hey, hey, Mike,

35:42.655 --> 35:44.299
like I said,
we are on our way

35:44.383 --> 35:46.577
to pick her up, but it is
a two-hour drive.

35:46.991 --> 35:48.742
No, you're lying.
I can feel it.

35:48.827 --> 35:50.954
No, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey, listen to me.

35:51.069 --> 35:52.861
I swear to God, we found her.

35:53.397 --> 35:54.686
You hear me?
We found her.

35:54.771 --> 35:56.314
I swear on the life
of my own children.

35:56.519 --> 35:58.312
<i>Then let me talk to her.</i>

36:02.301 --> 36:03.561
I can't.

36:03.701 --> 36:06.620
Look, she's in the hospital.

36:07.161 --> 36:08.459
<i>I didn't want to tell you that</i>

36:08.544 --> 36:10.253
<i>because I'm trying to get
more information,</i>

36:10.640 --> 36:12.560
<i>and because after everything
you've been through,</i>

36:12.744 --> 36:13.749
<i>I wanted
to give you some good news,</i>

36:13.833 --> 36:17.420
but, yeah, when we found her,
she needed medical attention,

36:17.505 --> 36:19.654
so we rushed her
to the hospital.

36:19.739 --> 36:22.264
"Medical attention"?
What does that mean?

36:23.611 --> 36:24.903
I'm not sure.

36:24.988 --> 36:26.740
I'm trying
to gather information.

36:28.218 --> 36:29.844
"Gather information"?

36:29.928 --> 36:33.295
I swear, I don't... I don't know
what to believe with you.

36:33.380 --> 36:35.220
She's here, she's there,
she's in the hospital.

36:35.309 --> 36:38.103
Now you're... you're
gathering information.

36:39.563 --> 36:41.522
Hey, I can...
I can show you a photo.

36:41.607 --> 36:43.117
I can put you on the phone
to the hospital.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.743
I'm not lying.

36:45.102 --> 36:46.895
No.

36:47.041 --> 36:51.170
I-I want to talk to her,
no one else.

36:51.325 --> 36:54.397
You... you have exactly ten
minutes to make that happen.

36:54.482 --> 36:56.274
<i>Look, we are so close,
buddy.</i>

36:56.457 --> 36:57.639
<i>You got to trust me here.</i>

36:57.724 --> 36:59.017
I'm gonna let you talk
to her soon as I...

36:59.101 --> 37:02.819
Say another word,
and I end this right now.

37:06.876 --> 37:08.585
Ten minutes.

37:19.311 --> 37:22.272
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.

37:37.302 --> 37:38.484
Isobel, he's at
a tipping point.

37:38.568 --> 37:40.109
He wants to talk
to his daughter in ten minutes.

37:40.193 --> 37:42.278
And He means it.
He's done negotiating.

37:42.602 --> 37:44.452
Did you tell him
she's in a coma?

37:44.578 --> 37:46.621
<i>No, I thought that would
push him over the edge.</i>

37:46.706 --> 37:48.397
I mean, he is
extremely agitated right now.

37:48.491 --> 37:50.523
He is desperate. The only thing
keeping him from hurting Chloe

37:50.607 --> 37:52.375
is... the hope that his daughter
was going to be okay.

37:52.459 --> 37:54.043
We take that away from him...

37:54.658 --> 37:56.264
So what's the play?

37:58.115 --> 37:59.592
We need to breach.

37:59.677 --> 38:02.596
SWAT said the odds of Chloe
surviving that are 50/50.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.155
If we do not breach,
the odds of Chloe surviving

38:05.240 --> 38:06.782
are a lot less than that.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.298
Okay.

38:18.147 --> 38:20.065
Okay, so on my signal, yeah?

38:20.150 --> 38:21.902
Yes, sir.

38:22.380 --> 38:23.647
All right.

38:23.919 --> 38:26.280
Okay.
Here we go.

38:33.721 --> 38:35.733
Mike, I have an update.

38:35.818 --> 38:37.881
<i>You got exactly
seven minutes left, Valentin.</i>

38:37.966 --> 38:39.884
<i>Don't waste your time
lying to me.</i>

38:40.061 --> 38:41.717
Look, Stephanie is ready
to talk.

38:41.802 --> 38:43.470
Now, she's barely conscious,

38:43.944 --> 38:45.389
<i>but they're going
to video chat me.</i>

38:45.474 --> 38:48.756
<i>So why don't you
walk right up to the monitor there,</i>

38:48.883 --> 38:52.178
and... we can make sure
you both see each other?

39:04.374 --> 39:05.166
Execute.

39:07.127 --> 39:09.337
<i>Drop your weapon!</i>

39:13.258 --> 39:14.675
<i>Stop.</i>

39:16.636 --> 39:18.355
<i>- Suspect down.
- Suspect is down.</i>

39:19.817 --> 39:21.360
Get that weapon away.

39:21.745 --> 39:23.741
You okay?
Let's get you upstairs.

39:23.826 --> 39:25.706
You're safe now.
Get her to the paramedics.

39:25.791 --> 39:27.644
Yeah.
Right this way.

39:27.729 --> 39:29.206
I got you.

39:41.901 --> 39:45.331
- Hey.
- Who are you?

39:45.614 --> 39:48.073
Jubal Valentine,
the guy you've been talking to.

39:50.941 --> 39:52.777
Shoot it to me straight.

39:53.264 --> 39:55.182
Did you find my daughter?

39:55.335 --> 39:57.711
She's been in a coma
for the past few hours,

39:57.913 --> 39:59.159
but we just got good news.

39:59.244 --> 40:00.829
She regained consciousness.

40:01.334 --> 40:04.544
The doctors say
she's gonna make a full recovery.

40:08.939 --> 40:10.190
I know...

40:10.452 --> 40:12.722
I know what I did
was crazy, but...

40:13.636 --> 40:15.387
it was worth it.

40:19.248 --> 40:20.791
I guess it was.

40:22.356 --> 40:24.941
Hey.

40:25.026 --> 40:27.753
Help him.
Help him.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.941
Come on.
Come on.
