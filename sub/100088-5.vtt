00:23.023 --> 00:24.328

to all of us.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.504
It's on the young bucks
to keep it going.

00:26.548 --> 00:29.899
That means I got to get
this Green Team pick... right.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.292
What the team needs is a guy

00:31.335 --> 00:32.858
who's gonna complement
his teammates

00:32.902 --> 00:34.164
and not compete with them.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.818
Let's all welcome
the newest brother

00:35.861 --> 00:37.124
to Bravo Team.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.517
SONNY: Drumroll.Vic Lopez.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.476
[cheering, whooping]Vic Lopez!

00:41.519 --> 00:43.652
Sonny, you can't
keep doing this.
What?

00:43.695 --> 00:44.914
DAVIS:
People are gonna see
right through it.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.047
SONNY:
Well, what's there to see?

00:47.090 --> 00:49.223
I just come to check on you.RAY:
You and Davis?

00:49.266 --> 00:51.399
How long have you two
been playing house
behind the team's back?

00:51.442 --> 00:53.140
What do you mean? What?
He said something to you?

00:53.183 --> 00:55.185

My sniper suite. 416.

The 4.6?

Strange finally

03:07.926 --> 03:09.145
Don't go patting yourself

03:09.189 --> 03:10.320
just yet, young brother.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.497
Your race just began.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.066
As far as the weapons go,

03:17.109 --> 03:18.850
outside of any team
requirements,

03:18.894 --> 03:20.548
you're pretty much cleared hot
to carry whatever you want,

03:20.591 --> 03:23.203
but most guys just carry
the HK416.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.944
Mm.
Sonny, he'll roll
with a machine gun.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.685
You know, if we bring one.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.774
And Clay and I, we go back
and forth as lead sniper,

03:29.818 --> 03:32.908
but even still, he carries
a 14.5, 416 with glass

03:32.951 --> 03:34.605
even if the rest of us
are rolling short barrels.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.085

Jason Hayes, my guy.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.917
Well, he will
use whatever.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.006
.22, nine millimeter.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.442
Hell, give the guy a slingshot

and he'll make it happen.

Everyone's in a

04:16.734 --> 04:19.171

Just, uh...

04:27.484 --> 04:29.312
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.618
Great, you gotta be
kidding me.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.315

to make coffee.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.972
One of the two of you.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.322
All you've got to do is
put coffee in the filter.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.106
That's all. And press "on."
Look at you.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.978
Yeah.Nice eyeliner there.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.414
Sonny, what, did you
forget the rules

04:44.458 --> 04:46.329
in the champagne room
last night?

04:46.373 --> 04:49.463
Yeah, you reach for some
forbidden fruit there, huh?

04:49.506 --> 04:51.116
Yeah, right.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.249
Sonny hasn't reached for
a piece of fruit in his life.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.424
Look at him.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.252
Jace, is there a reason
why we're here?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.646
Okay, 'cause unless
Scarlett Johansson's

04:58.689 --> 05:00.561
in a charitable mood,
I am going back to bed.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.345
You're not going back to bed.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.564
We're gonna run some CQB drills.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.000
Got to sharpen our edges.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.958
SONNY: Are you forgetting
that we just took down

05:07.002 --> 05:08.743
a fortified floating prison?

05:08.786 --> 05:10.527
We're as sharp as
Ginsu, brother.

05:10.571 --> 05:13.182
If you're seeing something
we're not, enlighten us, Jason.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.489
Just make sure you
speak extra slow

05:15.532 --> 05:16.838
so us sled dogs
can understand.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.405
We can always do better.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.407
Plus, we've got to break in
a new teammate.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.365
SONNY:
That new guy's been here
for five minutes,

05:22.409 --> 05:24.236
he's already rubbing me
the wrong way.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.674
CLAY:
Hey, new guy,

05:26.717 --> 05:28.545
you got a cold sixer
for old Sonny over here?

05:28.589 --> 05:30.417
'Cause the way he's whining,
he's gonna need it stat.

And how'd they like to be
our new breacher?

05:36.118 --> 05:37.380
[laughter]OTHERS: Oh!

05:37.424 --> 05:40.340
At least this guy hit me
from the front, Ray.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.081
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.605
You tell me,

05:44.648 --> 05:46.476
since you're so interested
in my business.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.219
You got something
gnawing at you, Sonny,

05:50.262 --> 05:51.655
you want to share
with the group?

05:54.179 --> 05:55.833
Nah, I'm just hungover.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.097
We good?

06:00.098 --> 06:01.535
Yeah, sure, boss.Good.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.275
Jock up.
Shoot house in five.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.147
Full Metal, make some coffee
on the way out.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.801
Do something right.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.807
Oh.
Oh, Jason.

06:12.850 --> 06:13.938
[chuckles, sighs]

06:13.982 --> 06:16.288
Dr. Pierce, I'm sorry.

06:16.332 --> 06:18.856
Didn't mean to run you over.Natalie.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.163
And I did not mean to
run you over, either.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.643
Last week, I mean.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.427
I feel like I might have
come at you too hard.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.037
You coming at me hard?

06:26.081 --> 06:29.301
No. Telling me that what,
my body's, I don't know,

06:29.345 --> 06:30.694
one step away from
being scrap heap?

06:30.738 --> 06:32.348
Tell you what,
that was fun.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.219
We should do that again
sometime.I just need you to know

06:34.263 --> 06:35.569
the entire aim of my work

06:35.612 --> 06:37.527
is to keep operators
in the field thriving

06:37.571 --> 06:39.050
for as long as possible.I'll tell you what.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.183
If I have any lack
of thriving, all right,

06:41.226 --> 06:42.793
I'll give you a call,
I'll come find you.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.186
I've been around
long enough to know

06:44.229 --> 06:45.709
you guys always think
you're right,

06:45.753 --> 06:48.712
but if you're not improving,
you're falling behind.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.975
You know what,
I have a system

06:51.019 --> 06:53.282
that works for me,
and it works.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.415
I don't need milks
that are made out of nuts.

06:55.458 --> 06:58.113
All right?
Or wheat grass shots.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.245
I'm out.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.986
I asked your teammates
about you

07:02.030 --> 07:03.771
in our intro consultations.

07:03.814 --> 07:06.469
They said you're the best
because you're never satisfied.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.036
Huh.

07:08.079 --> 07:11.256
Any chance to get an edge,
they said you'll take it.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.695
That's what I'm offering you.
An edge.

07:14.738 --> 07:18.438
[phone vibrating]

07:18.481 --> 07:20.440
Oh.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.963
[clicks tongue]

07:22.006 --> 07:24.705
That's the real thing.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.620
You're all aware of
the ongoing situation in Yemen.

07:26.663 --> 07:29.579
A five-year civil war has
ravaged the nation.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.755
Widespread famine,
food insecurity

07:31.799 --> 07:33.322
and civilian bloodshed.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.280
Bravo's been tapped
to help prevent

07:35.324 --> 07:37.544
one more torch from being
thrown into the inferno.

07:37.587 --> 07:40.938
U.S. Ambassador Nicole Marsden
is traveling to North Yemen

07:40.982 --> 07:43.419
to ease tensions between
two tribes there,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.421
the Bakil and the Hashid.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.075
You'll be working
as her security detail.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.598
The whole country's
in turmoil.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.426
Why is she focusing
on these two tribes?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.646
The last thing that Yemen needs
in the midst of a civil war

07:52.689 --> 07:53.603
is another civil war.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.910
The tribes represent

07:55.953 --> 07:57.302
a stabilizing influence
in the region

07:57.346 --> 07:59.609
if they can remain on peaceful
terms with each other.

07:59.653 --> 08:03.308
State has requested a Tier One
PSD for three weeks.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.136
That lengthy of a deployment,
it'll take a minute

08:05.180 --> 08:06.834
to get all the pieces in place.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.792
The ambassador's eager
to get to work.

08:08.836 --> 08:12.013
So we'll send a two-man
advance team right away,

08:12.056 --> 08:14.494
the rest of the unit joining
within 48 hours.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.974
Ray, run lead on ADVON.
Pick a swim buddy.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.367
I'm in.

08:18.410 --> 08:21.239
Anything to put Vah Beach
in the rearview mirror.

08:21.283 --> 08:23.764
ERIC:
Somebody got you
on the run, Sonny?

08:23.807 --> 08:26.114
No, just rather get in trouble
over there than here.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.072
Yeah, well, an itchy Sonny
on a mission of peace.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.335
Uh, I love you, brother, but
I don't think that's gonna work.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.512
Spenser, go pack
your gear, brother.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.557
A three-week PSD-- look,
if Sonny wants to go,

08:34.601 --> 08:35.645
I'm-I'm good with it.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.778
But I'm-I'm not good with that.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.128
So get geared up, man.
Come on.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.870
All right.
Whatever you say.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.699
Guess he is.

08:55.099 --> 08:58.973
Hey, I don't want you
hurting yourself.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.281
You know how sorry I am.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.587
It's not like

09:04.631 --> 09:07.503
I wanted this.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.200
It hasn't been easy
for me either.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.376
And I get it,
you're angry.
Angry?

09:11.420 --> 09:13.204
Have I ever been
angry with you?

09:13.248 --> 09:14.989
No, but look at your face.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.948
You're spinning out.
You're throwing hands in bars.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.385
You don't need to do that.

09:20.429 --> 09:24.564
Your opinion of what
I need to do ended when we did.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.398
[grunting]

09:33.442 --> 09:35.444
[indistinct chatter]

09:42.451 --> 09:44.235
Hey, Hendo.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.630
Let's hit it again.

09:47.674 --> 09:51.547
What, you didn't get
enough of me yesterday?

09:51.591 --> 09:52.679
[grunting]

09:56.117 --> 09:59.250
Tap out, dumbass.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.296
[straining]

10:02.950 --> 10:04.821
[panting]

10:04.865 --> 10:06.780
Is that all you got?

10:08.433 --> 10:10.697
[grunting]

10:15.049 --> 10:16.964
[chuckling weakly]

10:19.053 --> 10:21.055
[panting]

10:23.405 --> 10:25.886
[clears throat]

10:25.929 --> 10:27.844
VIC: Meant to give
this to you

10:27.888 --> 10:30.586
before you take off.
First day sixer.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.936
Not sure what they're drinking
over in Northern Yemen,

10:32.980 --> 10:35.852
but this probably beats it.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.115
Can just leave it there.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.645
Wanted to ask you something.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.822
Thought Jason and Ray
had all the answers around here.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.781
So, ask.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.827
Well, you were the last new guy.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.004
Got any advice for me?

10:58.745 --> 11:00.268
I haven't been the new guy

11:00.311 --> 11:01.617
in a long-ass time.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.575
If I ever was.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.055
Well, look, I didn't mean
any disrespect. I...

11:05.099 --> 11:06.317
You want me
to be real with you here?

11:06.361 --> 11:07.928
You weren't my pick.

11:07.971 --> 11:10.582
Look, I had my say about you,
and if anyone would've listened,

11:10.626 --> 11:12.062
you wouldn't be standing here
right now.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.803
'Cause in my opinion,
you were second best.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.806
This "aw, shucks"
attitude thing,

11:16.850 --> 11:18.808
the-the whole humble thing
you got going on,

11:18.852 --> 11:21.593
everything about you so clean
and tight, I don't trust it.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.900
You have to prove yourself
to me, and the only way

11:23.944 --> 11:26.686
to do that is by showing up
when our ass is in the fire.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.689
Till then,
you can just stay out of my way.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.432
Copy.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.748
We all know you wanted
the other guy from Green Team,

11:45.792 --> 11:47.358
but give Vic a shot.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.709
He's on Bravo. I'd call
that a hell of a shot.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.407
I'm saying give the kid
some time, maybe a little grace?

11:52.450 --> 11:54.191
Not every new guy's
gonna light-switch

11:54.235 --> 11:56.019
some HVT their first day out.

11:56.063 --> 11:59.109
Some people have got to pay
more dues than others.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.416
It's not the type of gig
you learn on the job.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.287
You either hit it hard,
or you get out of the way.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.376
You haven't seen
the kid in action yet.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.205
You know, all your talents,
Spenser, ESP is not one of them.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.816
And if you're doubting
my gut on this,

12:09.859 --> 12:12.949
remember it's the same gut that
pushed for your spot on Bravo.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.386
Look, my issue's
not with you, man.

12:15.430 --> 12:18.085
You're doing your thing.
I'm just trying to do mine.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.695
You don't know
what that is now.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.305
I get it.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.612
New new guy makes you
just one of the pack.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.527
Golden boy
becomes middle child.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.311
It's just part
of the team guy cycle.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.400
Hey. Embrace it.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.402
Don't resist it. Embrace it.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.927
I got no problem
being one of the pack.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.667
You are gonna get your chance

12:35.711 --> 12:37.408
to stand up and stand out,
Spenser.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.802
But it just may not happen
the way you think it is.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.718
Patience gonna pay off,
I promise you that.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.720
You guys lonely
without your entourage?

12:44.764 --> 12:47.244
Does feel like we're traveling
a little light, right?

12:47.288 --> 12:49.899
Welcome to Yemen. Agency's
had me embedded here

12:49.943 --> 12:52.075
for a few weeks,
taking the temperature.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.816
And what kind of weather
blew in the ambassador?

12:53.860 --> 12:57.298
Particularly nasty storm system
by the name of Musa Khawlan.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.213
He's a new leader
of the Bakil tribe.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.736
Militant, ambitious,

13:00.780 --> 13:02.999
stoking a hatred of
the Hashid tribe.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.696
Well, nation's
crashing around you.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.916
Misery loves a target.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.049
Khawlan's threatened violence
against Hashid leadership.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.659
They've responded in kind.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.617
Ambassador Marsden
is determined

13:12.661 --> 13:14.924
to meet with both sides
and reach a détente.

13:14.968 --> 13:18.841
American diplomat involving
themselves in tribal conflict?

13:18.885 --> 13:21.235
Is that courage or ignorance?

13:21.278 --> 13:23.933
That's Ambassador Marsden.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.327
She's aggressive
in her diplomacy.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.937
A risk-taker.

13:27.981 --> 13:30.766
Hmm. Coming from a gambler
like you,

13:30.810 --> 13:32.942
now I'm interested
in meeting her.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.989
[helicopter passing overhead]

13:48.131 --> 13:50.699
You know they still talk
about you over at Green Team?

13:50.742 --> 13:52.266
SONNY: Yep.VIC: That prank you pulled

13:52.309 --> 13:54.094
with the PT Cruiser.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.530
Legendary.

13:56.574 --> 13:57.967
You know, they still
can't figure out

13:58.011 --> 13:59.490
how the hell you got it
all the way up there.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.362
Seriously, you...Fold these.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.844
Make sure you steam
my underwear.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.414
Hey, you all right?

14:10.458 --> 14:11.851
Oh, yeah. Nut punching

14:11.894 --> 14:14.027
the new guy's
one of my sacred duties.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.680
Huh. Seems like the
past couple days,

14:15.724 --> 14:16.943
you got something
on your mind.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.206
Uh, just getting chafed
sitting stateside

14:19.249 --> 14:21.512
like I always do.
You know.Yeah, I don't know.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.819
Just seems like since
we got back from PACOM,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.995
being home has been
a lot easier for you.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.650
Like, I don't know, like
something's changed in you.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.174
Nah. Listen,
if I ever change,

14:31.218 --> 14:34.395
you go right ahead,
and you punch me in the face.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.484
I think someone's
already checked that box,

14:36.527 --> 14:38.834
Sonny.Yeah, well, maybe I did flirt
with it a little bit.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.357
Settling down with someone.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.664
Yeah?
[laughs]
Yeah.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.535
How was that?It's not for me.

14:44.579 --> 14:45.928
No. No,
I'll tell you what.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.452
There are two people
on God's great earth

14:48.496 --> 14:50.672
that won't ever change,
shouldn't ever change.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.717
And those two men
are standing right here.

14:52.761 --> 14:56.112
Right. So you, uh, you talk
to that physiologist yet?

14:56.156 --> 14:57.722
You meet up with her?Yeah.

14:57.766 --> 15:01.074
That lady's got some nerve
saying that some of my habits

15:01.117 --> 15:03.032
need, uh, modification.

15:03.076 --> 15:06.427
You believe that?Well... what kind of habits?

15:06.470 --> 15:08.472
I don't know,
I was hungover as hell.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.039
I wasn't really listening
to what she was saying.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.868
She just kept wagging her jaw
on and on and on and on.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.391
Guess some people can't
recognize perfection

15:14.435 --> 15:15.566
when they see it.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.394
Is that what I'm
staring at right there?

15:17.438 --> 15:19.875
Hey, if it ain't broke.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.704
See you, buddy.[door opens]

15:24.053 --> 15:26.055
[indistinct chatter][chickens clucking]

15:28.188 --> 15:31.539
It's an awfully public place to
meet a man wearing a bull's-eye.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.889
Tribal crown doesn't
come with an office?

15:33.933 --> 15:37.153
Imam Sahan refuses to bow
to the threats.

15:37.197 --> 15:41.462
He wants his Hashid brethren
to see him out in the open,

15:41.505 --> 15:43.681
unafraid and in control.

15:43.725 --> 15:44.987
DANIEL:
Optics are important.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.858
Yeah, well,
control's a cute idea.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.209
Sure you can trust
Sahan, Ambassador?

15:49.252 --> 15:52.212
Maybe the idea is to
put the bull's-eye on you.

15:52.255 --> 15:56.129
Then it's a good thing
I brought you guys along.

15:56.172 --> 15:59.654
Imam Sahan.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.569
Madam Ambassador.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.701
Thank you for meeting.Mm.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.969
RAY:
Bravo 1 to Rampart.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.448
Anything on overwatch?

16:11.492 --> 16:13.842
Negative, Bravo 1.

16:13.885 --> 16:16.410
OP 1 and 2 have
checked in all clear.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.628
Copy.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.326
OP 2, this is Bravo 1.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.501
How those rooftops looking?

16:20.544 --> 16:22.590
OP 2:
We're alone up here, Bravo 1.

16:22.633 --> 16:25.288
Copy that. Keep an
eye on that alley.

16:33.166 --> 16:36.473
Enough! The Bakil are led
by a madman!

16:36.517 --> 16:38.171
He would see my tribe
driven from our lands.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.782
Imam, if I may...It is an insult to me
that you would

16:40.825 --> 16:42.827
meet with such a man
as Musa Khawlan.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.090
The ambassador meant
no disrespect.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.354
Imam, meeting is
the only way to talk,

16:47.397 --> 16:49.878
talking the only way to peace.

16:49.921 --> 16:53.838
Peace, the only way to life.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.234
CLAY:
There goes low profile.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.195
RAY:
OP 2, biker making entry.
You got him?

17:02.238 --> 17:04.545
OP 2:
A-firm.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.851
Hold on and watch his hands.

17:18.907 --> 17:23.825
I believe you'll find my
proposals entirely reasonable.

17:23.868 --> 17:27.002
A framework for peace
with the Bakil.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.787
And, Imam, you
should know this.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.355
If I were going to
insult you,

17:32.399 --> 17:34.749
it would be about
this atrocity

17:34.792 --> 17:37.752
of a pastry you
recommended I try.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.452
[chuckling]

17:42.496 --> 17:46.674
Let's hope your proposal
is not equally amusing.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.374
Madam Ambassador.Imam.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.160
Moving.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.610
[helicopter passing outside]

18:14.615 --> 18:17.879
Um, I'm sorry,
you must be confused.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.533
The nut milk tasting
is tomorrow.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.317
[chuckles]

18:21.361 --> 18:23.102
You know, embracing people
who want to help me

18:23.145 --> 18:25.060
is not one of my
strengths, okay?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.844
As a door kicker, I think

18:26.888 --> 18:29.151
I'd be worried if it was.Look, I don't want to

18:29.195 --> 18:31.153
waste your time, I don't want
to waste my time.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.894
You got it?
So this program of yours,

18:32.937 --> 18:34.809
it's gonna extend my run
as an operator?

18:34.852 --> 18:37.681
The government's put
a lot of time and money

18:37.725 --> 18:39.857
into making you the
leader that you are.

18:39.901 --> 18:42.730
You won't do anyone any good
if you're mothballed.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.645
What are we talking here?

18:44.688 --> 18:46.037
Like, uh...

18:46.081 --> 18:47.648
how's this work?

18:47.691 --> 18:51.042
We look at the way you move,

18:51.086 --> 18:53.393
fight, sleep, eat, breathe.

18:53.436 --> 18:56.004
We are honest
about the damage,

18:56.047 --> 18:59.312
the issues,
and we figure out ways

18:59.355 --> 19:02.271
to help you do every single one
of those things better.

19:04.055 --> 19:07.972
I just want you to know that
I'm a meat eater. Understand?

19:08.016 --> 19:10.497
Burgers, steaks.
I like to grill.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.500
I'm a die-hard carnivore.
Got it?

19:13.543 --> 19:15.241
Copy that.
Yeah?

19:15.284 --> 19:18.809
Although, I mean, I-I know this
amazing brussels-turnip burger.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.855
I think maybe you
should give it a try.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.073
You're just hitting
my trigger points.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.727
Walking backwards here.

19:23.771 --> 19:27.775
Look, Mike Richards would
still be playing

19:27.818 --> 19:30.081
if he'd been on my program.

19:33.476 --> 19:34.564
You know hockey, huh?

19:34.608 --> 19:36.175
Just what I picked up
playing center

19:36.218 --> 19:37.524
at University of Wisconsin.

19:37.567 --> 19:41.441
Ugh, a Badger.Mm.

19:41.484 --> 19:42.877
What do you say?
Want to get started?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.488
Yeah, I'll hit you up.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.751
You know, think about it.

19:47.795 --> 19:51.364
When I'm back, maybe. Okay?
See you, Natalie.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.804
RAY:
Okay, got it. Thanks, Mandy.

19:56.847 --> 20:00.764
Intel from a local source says
there's a funeral procession

20:00.808 --> 20:02.984
near the diplomatic compound.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.073
Popular Bakil elder.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.249
Naseem Absi,
an honorable man.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.816
RAY:
Well,

20:08.859 --> 20:11.210
we got a few hundred hopefully
honorable Bakil mourners

20:11.253 --> 20:12.950
heading the same direction
as us.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.170
Mandy and GRS will
follow for support.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.524
Always fun
to have the Agency

20:21.568 --> 20:23.744
and their spotless record
along for the ride.

20:23.787 --> 20:27.487
They're still doing dollar
draft nights at the Sandy Frog?

20:27.530 --> 20:29.228
Sorry, ma'am?

20:29.271 --> 20:32.056
That was the deal when I was
at Naval Station Norfolk.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.972
Worth the trip to Vah Beach,

20:35.016 --> 20:38.585
long as you stayed clear of
those SEAL Team knuckleheads.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.021
I didn't know that you served.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.892
Five years as a JAG.

20:41.936 --> 20:46.288
Thought I'd be Atticus Finch in
dress blues, battling injustice.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.768
How did that lead
to Foreign Service?

20:47.811 --> 20:49.552
It didn't. I separated,

20:49.596 --> 20:52.599
earlier than my C.O.
would have liked, actually.

20:52.642 --> 20:55.602
Realized the impact I wanted
to have on the world wouldn't

20:55.645 --> 20:57.473
happen inside
a courtroom.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.083
JAG's a good career choice.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.694
Big gamble to leave that, right?

21:00.737 --> 21:02.739
That's what everybody told me.

21:02.783 --> 21:07.222
"Keep paying your dues,
be patient, don't push it."

21:07.266 --> 21:09.833
And now you feel like
you're having an impact?

21:09.877 --> 21:13.489
Still hear the same old song
from the same kind of people.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.753
"Diplomacy's a process,
don't rock the boat."

21:16.797 --> 21:18.625
But guess what.

21:18.668 --> 21:22.672
Boat's been corroding in the
same toxic water for decades.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.761
We allgot
to start rocking it.

21:24.805 --> 21:28.330
Yeah, I bet that hasn't
won you a ton of friends.

21:28.374 --> 21:31.159
People don't really
appreciate a maverick streak.

21:31.202 --> 21:34.336
Something tells me
you like making waves, too.

21:34.380 --> 21:37.600
Yeah, well, Navy's not
real big on vessel rocking.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.341
[men shouting outside]

21:39.385 --> 21:41.822
[chatter in foreign language]

21:47.741 --> 21:50.309
Man in that casket was
a man of peace.

21:50.352 --> 21:53.964
He remembered that the Bakil
and Hashid tribes

21:54.008 --> 21:57.011
were descended
from two brothers.

21:57.054 --> 21:59.361
And you're here to get
others to remember that, too?

21:59.405 --> 22:03.322
Mm. I'm here to get people
to focus on what unites

22:03.365 --> 22:06.499
rather than divides them
so they don't kill each other.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.283
RAY:
Yeah, well, the ones
who focus on division

22:08.327 --> 22:10.938
are always louder,
so let's get you inside.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.122
[chatter continues
in foreign language]

22:29.696 --> 22:32.481
Ma'am, I really think we need
to get you inside the residence.

22:32.525 --> 22:35.005
[gunfire]

22:35.049 --> 22:36.398
We're-we're good.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.617
Hey, we're good! We're good!

22:38.966 --> 22:40.228
It's celebratory.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.753
You know, Senior Chief Perry,

22:43.797 --> 22:46.495
yeah, might be a good idea
head on in.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.062
Yes, ma'am.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.066
Ambassador's safe inside.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.502
She's, uh...

22:53.546 --> 22:55.199
She's got Mandy captive,

22:55.243 --> 22:57.506
trying to get
Agency intel from her.

22:57.550 --> 23:00.204
Lady's something else.
Tell you what.

23:00.248 --> 23:02.424
More focused on the task
at hand than her career.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.079
Not exactly following
the politician playbook.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.602
She's definitely got
a rebel streak in her.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.561
That's for damn sure.

23:08.604 --> 23:11.085
Ray, crowd stopped in
front of the compound.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.739
They're not moving on.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.917
RAY:
That doesn't feel right.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.660
No. No, neither does that.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.533
Tire fires.

23:24.577 --> 23:25.708
They're signaling.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.799
Doesn't take much to
turn grief into rage.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.149
Yeah, or a funeral into a riot.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.594
[indistinct radio chatter]

23:45.249 --> 23:46.903
JASON:
20 minutes to touchdown.

23:46.947 --> 23:49.210
Looks like
you didn't sleep, huh?

23:49.253 --> 23:51.255
No, not much.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.301
It's all the same stuff
as the regular teams,

23:53.344 --> 23:54.955
we just get better ops.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.173
Maybe.

23:56.217 --> 23:59.089
Doesn't feel that way, though.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.398
You remember your
first time out?

24:06.488 --> 24:08.925
[exhales]
Lot different back then.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.928
It was June '01.

24:11.972 --> 24:17.543
Thought I was signing up
for life as a peacetime Frogman.

24:17.586 --> 24:20.807
Few months later,
the world caught fire.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.202
20 years later,
little did I know,

24:25.246 --> 24:27.248
I'd still be fighting that fire.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.644
War since I was in first grade.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.691
But that combat,

24:35.735 --> 24:38.955
look what it shaped DEVGRU
and the teams into.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.044
I'm proud to be a part of it.SONNY: Oh.

24:41.088 --> 24:43.873
C-Come on. [stammers] This kid
sounds like he was conceived

24:43.917 --> 24:46.397
and raised in a DoD lab.

24:46.441 --> 24:48.574
Hey, I would've taken that
over the deal I got.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.228
Oh, what do you think,
we all made it here with a life

24:51.272 --> 24:53.796
of Betty Crocker
and father-and-son Scout trips?

24:53.840 --> 24:58.801
Please, Victoria, spare us
your tragic emo origin story.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.587
JASON:
Don't take it personally.
He's sleep-deprived.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.937
Actually, Sonny's
always sleep-deprived.[phone ringing]

25:03.980 --> 25:05.939
But you know what?
Little advice:

25:05.982 --> 25:08.028
whatever you have
in the rearview mirror,

25:08.071 --> 25:10.204
uh, keep it there.Roger that.

25:10.247 --> 25:14.774
As far as I'm concerned, my life
started when I joined the teams.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.906
Blackburn. We're about to land.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.648
Well, Command wants you
sitting tight on the tarmac.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.563
There's a situation
developing near the compound.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.434
We don't want to inflame it.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.132
What's going on?

25:25.175 --> 25:27.047
Big group of fighting-age males
just joined the crowd.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.571
Definitely not mourners.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.355
Guys are carrying bags.
They look heavy, too.

25:33.575 --> 25:34.620
And I got a guy 200 meters south

25:34.663 --> 25:36.186
of building one

25:36.230 --> 25:38.188
on a radio.
Looks like he's on watch.

25:38.232 --> 25:40.234
MANDY:
Two more on the
street with radios.

25:40.277 --> 25:41.801
Source on the ground
says a number

25:41.844 --> 25:44.543
of local shops shuttered early.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.719
Something in the air.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.590
Check out that rooftop.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.026
Carrying hard cases.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.333
MANDY:
Could be journalists,

25:52.376 --> 25:53.769
camera gear?

25:53.813 --> 25:55.205
Yeah, it could be
bowling balls, too,

25:55.249 --> 25:56.903
but something tells me
they're not.

25:56.946 --> 25:59.558
And these tire fires, they're
not, they're not random at all.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.950
They're evenly spaced
and choking off

26:00.994 --> 26:02.169
all the entries and exits
to this area.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.605
They're roadblocks.

26:03.649 --> 26:04.954
Yeah, this is coordinated.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.608
Feels like
they're setting up on us.

26:06.652 --> 26:10.177
I agree. There's nothing
spontaneous about this at all.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.482
[beeps]

26:13.093 --> 26:16.357
This is Bravo 2.
What's your ETA?JASON: They're holding us

26:16.400 --> 26:18.838
at the airstrip.
Something about civilian unrest.

26:18.881 --> 26:20.666
I don't know how many
of these guys are civilians.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.842
This is starting to look
like a coordinated assault, J.

26:26.889 --> 26:28.543
I understand that, Jason, but...

26:28.587 --> 26:30.023
JASON:
No, you don't understand.
All right?

26:30.066 --> 26:31.328
They need us.
We're ten klicks away,

26:31.372 --> 26:33.156
roads are getting blocked off.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.203
Yeah, and as I said, the brass
thinks that adding more troops

26:36.246 --> 26:39.032
to the scenario is a bad idea.Look,

26:39.075 --> 26:40.686
Ray knows what he's looking at.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.688
This thing lights off,
I got two of my team guys

26:42.731 --> 26:45.473
and three contractors
going up against an army.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.954
Look, I am pushing
every way I can, Jason.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.651
Stand by.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.392
The whole intel shop's
digging in.

26:51.435 --> 26:53.394
Bakil social media, local news,

26:53.437 --> 26:55.222
any whiff of what
might be brewing.

26:55.265 --> 26:56.571
Mandy's already I.D.'d

26:56.615 --> 26:58.704
several known
Bakil hardliners in the crowd.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.880
It's a funeral for
a tribal elder.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.360
Could just be paying
their respects.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.362
Giving them
the benefit of the doubt.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.582
I'd rather give us
the benefit of a visual.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.976
TECH:
We're on station.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.502
ERIC:
Smoke from the tire fires
sure ain't helping us.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.460
We'll get a clearer picture.

27:16.504 --> 27:19.072
Are there any other entry points
on this compound?

27:19.115 --> 27:20.726
A delivery hatch.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.118
Okay. Where?

27:22.162 --> 27:24.077
Come on, man, you're
the damn security chief.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.513
You got to help us out here.

27:25.556 --> 27:28.124
The southeast corner.
It's locked, fortified.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.474
Okay, in case of emergency
exfil, where's the helo landing?

27:30.518 --> 27:32.868
The roof.
GPS coordinates are there.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.829
The vehicles in this motor pool.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.005
They're exposed. Is there
any cover we could move them to?

27:39.048 --> 27:40.702
Nothing like that.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.530
CLAY:
What about an armory?

27:42.573 --> 27:44.140
Anything on site?

27:44.184 --> 27:46.969
Yes, down the hall.
But it won't be enough.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.841
What?

27:48.884 --> 27:50.843
This is not an embassy.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.715
This is a temporary
residential outpost.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.804
We are not equipped
to repel an attack.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.153
Yeah, well, clearly, you're not,
but we need your help.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.241
Do you understand?

27:58.285 --> 28:00.809
I cannot stay here. I'm sorry.

28:00.853 --> 28:03.464
You're not leaving.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.554
I'm sorry.

28:07.947 --> 28:11.559
Clay. Let him go.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.822
God help you.

28:18.305 --> 28:20.263
He knows.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.701
He knows what's coming.
They got to the security team.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.703
RAY:
Yeah, well,
screw him.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.053
He'd just run when the
shooting starts anyway, right?

28:27.096 --> 28:29.882
Fine. No JV team in our way now.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.797
Damn straight.Let's go.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.238
Ambassador.

28:38.281 --> 28:41.067
Entire compound staff is here.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.243
Panic level started at a seven.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.332
I think we're down to a five.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.507
Five will work.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.770
All right, everyone, listen up.

28:48.814 --> 28:51.251
You're gonna remain sheltered
down here, okay? You are safe.

28:51.294 --> 28:53.775
So stay calm.
Wait for our instructions.

28:53.819 --> 28:56.169
Okay?

28:56.212 --> 28:58.171
I'm gonna head out.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.521
Ma'am, we need to pin down
an exit plan immediately.

29:00.564 --> 29:03.654
Breathe, Daniel. The plan right
now is to shelter in place.

29:03.698 --> 29:06.266
That changes,
you'll be the first to know.

29:09.095 --> 29:11.924
Seems like you got this, uh,
this peacekeeper thing down.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.926
It's all a cover.
Don't tell.

29:13.969 --> 29:16.058
[chuckles]
I'm not buying it.

29:16.102 --> 29:18.234
Feels like this is what
you were born to do.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.888
Maybe.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.717
Took me a while to
discover it, anyway.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.546
I always envied
people like you.

29:25.589 --> 29:28.244
How's that?
Hmm.

29:28.288 --> 29:33.597
Must've found your calling early
to rise to the top so young.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.599
Maybe.

29:35.643 --> 29:38.559
I hope you were born to fight.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.517
The people here need you.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.607
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.531
JASON:
All right, let's go.

29:54.575 --> 29:56.359
Get in, gear up. All right?

29:56.403 --> 29:59.014
Get the ground transportation
unloaded. Let's go. Move.

29:59.058 --> 30:01.625
I thought the, uh, Pentagon
fun police was holding us here.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.845
Nope. Tell you what,

30:03.889 --> 30:05.934
the longer these cake-eaters
deny the situation,

30:05.978 --> 30:07.544
the worse it's gonna get.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.546
We're rolling out
against orders?
No.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.026
Just want to
be ready.

30:11.070 --> 30:13.376
When we get the go, we go.
Got it?

30:15.770 --> 30:17.728
Fighting-age males
are sticking around,

30:17.772 --> 30:19.861
but the rest of the crowd's
clearing out.

30:19.905 --> 30:22.037
Sheltering from the storm.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.999
Take overwatch
on the south roof,

30:27.042 --> 30:29.175
cover down on any activity
at the back of the rear gate.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.654
Got it.[gunfire]

30:30.698 --> 30:34.354
[yelling]

30:34.397 --> 30:35.964
This is Bravo 2, Havoc.

30:36.008 --> 30:37.836
We got troops in contact.
I say again, troops in contact.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.402
I've got a man down.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.581
Send 'em now.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.498
All right, boys,
we're cleared hot.

30:48.542 --> 30:49.760
Let's load up.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.426
[groans]Hand me that, come on.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.821
