00:12.720 --> 00:14.480
[engine revs]

00:15.720 --> 00:18.080
-[Ariston] Woo-hoo!
-[Mangle] Yeah!

00:20.360 --> 00:21.680
[engine revs]

00:25.440 --> 00:27.480
-Oh!
-Hold tight, Mangle.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.120
The fun’s about to begin.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.120
Mm.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.400
[engines rev and tyres squeal]

00:34.400 --> 00:35.800
[Mangle grunts]

00:35.880 --> 00:37.320
Good idea, Mangle.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.880
[engine roars]

00:39.440 --> 00:41.000
[engines roar and tyres squeal]

00:48.280 --> 00:49.360
Kick it, Mangle!

00:50.480 --> 00:51.640
[grunts]

00:51.720 --> 00:56.560
Whoa! [laughs]
Oh, yeah! One down, two to go!

00:56.640 --> 00:57.800
-[engine revs]
-Whoa!

01:04.040 --> 01:07.200
Now, let’s see how Centurions do
with craters.

01:07.280 --> 01:11.040
-Hm? Oh!
-[Ariston laughs and whoops]

01:11.120 --> 01:12.280
Yeah!

01:15.240 --> 01:16.480
[tyres squeal]

01:18.560 --> 01:19.680
Uh-oh.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.680
Mangle, protect.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.640
Hm?

01:29.120 --> 01:29.960
[grunting]

01:34.600 --> 01:35.440
[grunting]

01:35.800 --> 01:38.360
[Ariston whoops and Mangle grunts]

02:11.200 --> 02:12.560
We made it, Mangle.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.560
-Botrus Arena straight ahead.
-Huh.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.160
Oh.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.560
[tyres squeal]

02:22.480 --> 02:26.200
Well, well, look who’s here,
the robot jackhammer.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.560
[groans]

02:27.960 --> 02:30.760
Don’t mind him.
I see you've repaired your workbot.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.040
-Want another try-out?
-No.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.240
Just here to watch you train
your Combatabots.

02:35.640 --> 02:40.040
I’m Livia, team captain for Team Veredus.
This is Chike.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.320
Team technician extraordinaire.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.200
-Ariston and this is Mangle.
-Mm.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.880
Nice to meet you. Okay,
you already know Clunk and Spark.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.440
Huh?

02:54.520 --> 02:57.240
[whirring and bleeping]

02:57.320 --> 02:59.280
[Mangle grunts] Huh? Hm?

02:59.360 --> 03:02.800
[chuckles] Meet Scramble, our crashbot.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.520
I think he likes you, Mangle.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.480
Crashbot?

03:05.560 --> 03:08.880
Team Mascot,
cleans up at the Robozuna games,

03:08.960 --> 03:12.760
picks up bot parts that fall off
due to the occasional crash.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.680
Livia, what’s going on out here?

03:15.280 --> 03:19.480
Oh, um, practising. Clunk, coming at you.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.240
-[grunts]
-[all laugh]

03:24.920 --> 03:27.000
Dad, this is Ariston and Mangle.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.240
-I’m Lanista, coach of Team Veredus.
-Think you’ll win today?

03:31.320 --> 03:34.480
We’re playing tough opponents,
but there’s always a chance.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.720
[Spark groans]

03:45.120 --> 03:46.720
Doesn’t look too bad, Chike.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.400
Get Spark into the workshop,
check him out. I’ve got to go sign us in.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.160
And, Livia, see if your new friends
want to come to the game.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.200
They can join us on the team platform.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.680
The game? The Robozuna game?

04:00.760 --> 04:02.560
Is there any other game?

04:10.880 --> 04:13.800
Great job, Niven.
Now we can get out of here.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.200
Ariston and Mangle,
haven’t seen them today. You?

04:19.280 --> 04:21.840
No. I did notice Ariston’s bike’s gone.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.480
And I noticed Ariston hasn’t repaired
his communicator yet.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.160
Perfect. Can’t reach him.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.600
Well, better load it up,
get everyone ready to roll.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.600
No problem, boss.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.960
-Did you get him to talk?
-[Vermis] I did.

04:47.040 --> 04:53.040
Oh, Commander Vermis,
always so persuasive with your words.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.320
-[groans]
-[Vermis] Believe me, Danuvia,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.560
it wasn’t my words that persuaded him.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.320
The outlaw drillers are near
the Ridge Road.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.600
Their leader’s name is Feronia.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.320
[distant cheering]

05:12.400 --> 05:18.200
Welcome to the metal-bashing,
season opener of the Robozuna games!

05:18.280 --> 05:22.760
Today’s game is between Team Pardus

05:22.840 --> 05:25.080
and Team Veredus!

05:25.160 --> 05:27.240
[chatter of crowd]

05:27.320 --> 05:29.680
You two, try to stay out of the way.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.440
Gets a little crazy sometimes.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.520
Yes, sir.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.960
Combatabot systems
all running at optimal levels.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.920
Our bots are good to go.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.240
Okay, they’re putting in Gripper,
so, let’s start with Clunk.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.400
Clunk-a-matic!

05:57.480 --> 06:01.280
Spanner, you played against Team Pardus
back when you were a pro.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.840
What about this match up?

06:02.920 --> 06:06.240
Well, Slick, as you know,
Gripper’s fast on his feet

06:06.320 --> 06:10.800
and Clunk will have to watch out for
his metal-snapping, Gripper-rip move!

06:10.880 --> 06:11.760
Ow!

06:12.240 --> 06:13.320
Ha. Sorry.

06:13.960 --> 06:18.080
-All right, then, it’s game on!
-[cheering]

06:18.160 --> 06:19.400
Hoo-hoo! Round one!

06:31.840 --> 06:32.680
[grunts]

06:33.200 --> 06:34.360
-Ah!
-[Livia] Go, Clunk!

06:34.440 --> 06:37.880
Can you believe it, Mangle?
We’re at a real Robozuna game!

06:37.960 --> 06:40.320
Is this our lucky day, or what?

06:40.800 --> 06:42.560
We’re out of luck, Feronia.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.480
I’ve intercepted a Corvus communication.
Airships headed this way.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.120
We have to leave now.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.400
[sighs] Then we go. I’m sure
Ariston and Mangle will catch us up...

06:53.640 --> 06:56.000
[sighs] ...if they can find us.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.320
[engine revs and tyres squeal]

07:01.240 --> 07:03.000
[Chike] Go, Clunk!

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
[Livia] Go, Clunk!

07:04.640 --> 07:06.400
[Clunk] Out my way, Gripper!

07:08.240 --> 07:10.920
Take the shot! You’ve got this, Clunk!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.320
[chuckles] Clunk got this.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.800
-Clunk! Watch out! Behind you!
-The Clunk-a-matic!

07:17.880 --> 07:19.680
-[Chike] Careful, Clunk!
-Gripper!

07:21.360 --> 07:22.640
[sighs]

07:22.720 --> 07:24.160
[groans]

07:24.240 --> 07:27.000
Clunk’s fluid pressure’s down 44%
and dropping.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.720
-Seal the leaks or he’ll seize up.
-I’m trying.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.560
[Slick] Yeah! [laughs]

07:37.880 --> 07:39.040
[both] Whoa!

07:41.360 --> 07:44.960
Eh? [chuckles] Huh?

07:45.240 --> 07:47.800
Aw, man. He’s seized up.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.520
Uh... Clunk can’t move.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.880
Too bad, Clunk.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.600
Now I’m going to Gripper-rip you!

07:55.520 --> 07:57.120
-[grunts]
-[cheering]

07:57.600 --> 07:58.840
Didn’t hurt.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.560
Still didn’t hurt.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.440
[man] Score!

08:08.040 --> 08:08.920
[cheering]

08:09.000 --> 08:12.600
Team Pardus scores! Ending Round One!

08:12.680 --> 08:16.600
And it’s one to Pardus, zero to Veredus!

08:16.680 --> 08:19.080
Robo-Robozuna!

08:19.160 --> 08:21.880
I could've told you,
never turn your back on Gripper

08:21.960 --> 08:24.000
or you’ll get the ol’ Gripper-rip.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.760
He loves a bit of a<i>rmless</i> fun. [laughs]

08:28.400 --> 08:30.000
Clunk not laughing.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.240
Hey, Team Pardus just got lucky.

08:33.560 --> 08:36.000
Scramble, bring Clunk in.
Clear the wreckage.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.880
[bleeps]

08:44.000 --> 08:46.400
Time for my knuckle buster!

08:47.480 --> 08:49.480
Gasket, what a show-off.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.160
Spark, you’re up.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.160
Chike, get Clunk ready for round three...
if there is a round three.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.320
No worries, I'll make this quick.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.760
Oh, yeah! Taser-jab!

08:59.840 --> 09:00.680
[cheering]

09:00.760 --> 09:05.160
Round Two! Team Pardus’ Gasket
against Team Veredus’ Spark!

09:05.240 --> 09:07.040
[chuckles] Game back on!

09:08.200 --> 09:10.200
[cheering]

09:10.920 --> 09:11.880
[grunts]

09:11.960 --> 09:12.800
No!

09:13.840 --> 09:14.680
[grunts]

09:16.600 --> 09:18.360
Sorry. That ball is mine.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.840
No! It’s mine!

09:22.400 --> 09:25.040
Ha! This is almost too easy.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.080
[grunts]

09:30.560 --> 09:31.600
Oh!

09:31.680 --> 09:32.880
So close.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.760
Massive hydraulic line damage.
Spark’s taser arm could rupture.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.360
Pressure spiking into the red.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.640
He’s got one move before he shuts down.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.400
Then make it count.
Divert all system energy to his taser.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.360
Spark! Taser-jab!

09:47.440 --> 09:49.200
Mm, yeah. [grunts]

09:49.280 --> 09:50.480
[groans]

09:50.560 --> 09:52.040
That’s it! You’ve got him!

09:52.120 --> 09:54.920
[groans and powers down]

09:55.480 --> 09:58.640
Oh, yeah. Who got the moves?
Who got the moves?

10:03.120 --> 10:04.880
[cheering]

10:04.960 --> 10:08.320
Who got the moves? Who got the moves?
Who got the moves?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.520
Team Veredus scores!

10:10.600 --> 10:12.800
It’s all tied up! [laughs] One to one!

10:12.880 --> 10:18.080
Next up, Robozuna tie-breaker!
Round three! [chuckles]

10:18.160 --> 10:20.720
Outstanding play by Spark there.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.160
Got to love that taser-jab.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.240
-Ha! Got you!
-[groans]

10:27.640 --> 10:28.880
Way to go, Spark.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.640
Look, fixing Spark’s
hydraulic line’s no problem,

10:32.720 --> 10:35.960
but no way can I get Clunk repaired
in time for round three.

10:36.440 --> 10:40.240
Don’t need no help. Can win
without getting my armour dirty.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.800
Sorry, Spark,
but this is a two-on-two round

10:42.880 --> 10:45.680
and if we can’t put two bots in,
we lose the game.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.760
That’s the rules.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.600
What about putting Mangle in?

10:49.080 --> 10:51.560
Your workbot's not programmed
to be a Combatabot.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.400
He wouldn’t know how to play Robozuna.

10:53.480 --> 10:57.960
If Spark really thinks he can win
against two, Mangle won’t have to play.

10:58.040 --> 11:01.760
He’ll just have to keep
the Pardus bots busy, get in their way.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.400
-Yeah and we know he’s good at that.
-[chuckling]

11:05.360 --> 11:06.400
Hm.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.880
Might just work.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.280
Okay, thanks.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.680
All right, Mangle. Just imagine
Spark is me and needs protecting.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.040
Uh, you are aware we can’t link
our systems to Mangle, right?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.760
We can’t monitor or help him out there.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.440
Yeah. I know.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.040
Hm.

11:30.480 --> 11:35.560
[crowd] Robozuna! Robozuna! Robozuna!

11:35.640 --> 11:40.720
Robozuna! Robozuna! Robozuna!

11:40.800 --> 11:44.720
Robozuna! Robozuna! Robo...

11:44.800 --> 11:47.480
[Ariston] Mangle! Mangle! Up here, buddy!

11:48.600 --> 11:52.400
You can do this, Mangle!
I believe in you! I always have!

11:52.480 --> 11:54.320
I'm your best friend, remember?

12:06.800 --> 12:08.200
[sighs]

12:08.640 --> 12:11.280
Go on! I need you to protect Spark!

12:11.360 --> 12:14.800
I won't let anything bad happen
to you out there, promise.

12:16.040 --> 12:16.920
Protect.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.720
He’s going to be okay, Ariston.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.480
Spark will wrap this game up for us
with a super-quick score.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.160
He’d better be okay.
He means everything to me.

12:27.240 --> 12:33.040
Get ready, Robozuna fans,
for the final round of this exciting game!

12:33.120 --> 12:35.160
Wait! Hey, Spanner, what’s this?

12:37.920 --> 12:41.160
Get close, you’re toast. The taser-jab!

12:43.720 --> 12:46.600
It looks like a workbot
has entered the game!

12:46.680 --> 12:50.000
-I hope he gets flattened!
-He should stick to taking out the trash!

12:50.080 --> 12:52.640
-[man laughs] Good one!
-Soon he will be trash!

12:52.720 --> 12:53.840
That’s right, Slick.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.080
I’ve just been informed
the workbot is playing for Team Veredus

12:57.160 --> 12:59.880
and his name is Mangle...? [laughs]

12:59.960 --> 13:03.360
Which is exactly what he’s going to get...
Mangled!

13:04.280 --> 13:05.440
[laughs]

13:05.520 --> 13:08.160
It’s game on!

13:08.640 --> 13:10.120
[klaxon, crowd cheer]

13:10.200 --> 13:12.720
I’m gonna Gripper-rip ya!

13:12.800 --> 13:15.720
Watch out for my power-cut.

13:16.120 --> 13:16.960
Hm.

13:18.960 --> 13:19.840
Hm?

13:24.360 --> 13:25.960
-[groans]
-[cheering]

13:26.040 --> 13:29.880
Be careful, Mangle!
You have to try and defend yourself.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.480
[Spanner] This game’s going to be over
before it starts.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.840
[grunts]

13:43.560 --> 13:46.800
[Spanner] He’s dropped the thudball!
And we’ve got a loose thudball!

13:51.760 --> 13:52.600
[grunts]

13:53.000 --> 13:56.680
That ball’s mine.
I’m gonna Gripper-rip ya!

13:57.440 --> 13:58.520
[grunts]

13:58.600 --> 14:02.280
-[Spanner] Oh, what a hit!
-Ariston, why isn’t he doing anything?

14:02.360 --> 14:05.000
He’s programmed to protect others,
not himself.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.720
[sighs]
Why did I ever think he could play?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.040
[grunts]

14:11.080 --> 14:12.280
[groans]

14:12.360 --> 14:14.120
[grunts and groans]

14:15.440 --> 14:16.920
Oh!

14:17.400 --> 14:19.600
Now to finish this...

14:20.960 --> 14:22.000
[groans]

14:22.080 --> 14:24.280
Spark! He’s not responding.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.520
Can’t reboot him.
Mangle’s on his own out there.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.720
Mangle! Mangle, get up!

14:29.800 --> 14:31.760
Come on, buddy. Get up! Get up!

14:32.240 --> 14:36.000
[groans]

14:36.680 --> 14:37.520
[groans]

14:37.600 --> 14:41.880
Told ya. That ball’s mine.
Game over, workbot.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.560
No! Mangle!

14:45.160 --> 14:46.000
[groans]

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
[groans]

14:48.480 --> 14:50.680
Mangle! Mangle, hold on!

14:50.760 --> 14:53.120
It’s my turn to protect you now.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.560
And I’ve got an idea!

14:54.640 --> 14:58.640
A final Gripper-rip and you’re finished.

14:59.280 --> 15:03.400
Mangle, your flash welder, use it now!
Weld his arm!

15:06.160 --> 15:07.760
[both grunt]

15:10.360 --> 15:12.720
Hey, what did you do?

15:12.800 --> 15:14.840
[laughs] And now his legs!

15:16.840 --> 15:20.680
[grunts and groans]

15:22.000 --> 15:24.120
The ball! Grab the thudball!

15:24.480 --> 15:26.240
[Spanner] This game is not over yet!

15:26.320 --> 15:29.440
-That’s it! You got it!
-[Lanista] He’s going in for the score!

15:29.520 --> 15:31.320
-Go, Mangle!
-You can do it!

15:31.400 --> 15:32.240
[gasps]

15:32.920 --> 15:37.120
-Look out! Behind you!
-Mangle! Behind you!

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
[Lanista] Watch out!

15:47.560 --> 15:48.400
[groans]

15:48.480 --> 15:49.760
[cheering]

15:49.840 --> 15:51.720
[Spanner] Ha! Did you see that!

15:54.960 --> 15:56.520
[cheering]

15:56.600 --> 16:00.600
[crowd chant] Mangle! Mangle!
Mangle! Mangle! Mangle...

16:01.800 --> 16:04.960
Unbelievable!

16:05.040 --> 16:06.720
Ma-Ma-Ma-Mangle!

16:06.800 --> 16:09.000
What a shot! Mangle scores!

16:09.080 --> 16:12.240
-Team Veredus wins the game!
-[cheering]

16:12.320 --> 16:14.880
Robo-Robozuna!

16:14.960 --> 16:18.360
Ha! And what about
that metal-mangling Mangle move?

16:18.440 --> 16:19.400
Oh, pow!

16:19.480 --> 16:20.560
[yells in pain]

16:21.040 --> 16:21.880
[groans]

16:21.960 --> 16:22.840
Oops.

16:22.920 --> 16:26.360
-[all] Robozuna!
-[laughing and cheering]

16:26.440 --> 16:29.280
[Ariston] I knew he could do it.
Ha-ha! Yes!

16:36.240 --> 16:38.440
Hang on, Clunk. Thought I fixed that.

16:38.520 --> 16:41.160
-Where’d your dad go?
-Went to talk to the other team.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.080
Likes to keep on friendly terms,
win or lose.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.360
I still can’t believe it.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.160
We won our first game...
thanks to Mangle.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.040
-We going to see you again?
-Don’t think so.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.360
We’re always moving around and...

16:54.440 --> 16:56.560
-[gasps] Rafie?
-[pants and groans]

16:56.640 --> 16:58.120
You okay? What happened?

16:58.200 --> 17:01.360
I knew you’d be here.
You have to warn her.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.680
-Corvus knows.
-Knows what?

17:03.760 --> 17:06.680
Knows about Feronia, about your drilling.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.320
They forced me to give you up.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.880
Mangle protect.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.440
[Niven] Feronia!

17:25.400 --> 17:27.800
Corvus Airship... heading our way!

17:29.080 --> 17:33.200
Abandon your vehicles! If they find us,
they’ll target them first.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.840
If attacked,
no one fires until I give the order.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.040
We don’t have enough ammo to waste any.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.160
[rumble of engine]

17:56.240 --> 17:57.200
[gasps]

17:58.840 --> 18:01.400
Found them. Commander?

18:01.480 --> 18:04.760
Corvus shows no mercy to outlaws. Proceed.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.240
[gasps]

18:15.760 --> 18:16.600
Argh!

18:17.200 --> 18:18.520
Defend yourselves!

18:27.840 --> 18:28.800
Ooh!

18:32.440 --> 18:33.360
[tyres squeal]

18:34.640 --> 18:36.080
[pants] Centurions!

18:36.160 --> 18:38.360
This is bad. Feronia’s in trouble.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.480
Mangle protect.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.400
No, Mangle, wait!

18:47.520 --> 18:50.560
It’s hopeless.
The three of us can’t take on Centurions.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.840
[Mangle] Mangle protect.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.480
It’s not just the three of us.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.600
We’ve got Mangle and your Combatabots.

18:57.680 --> 19:01.120
Yeah, but they’re only programmed
to battle other bots in the games.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.560
Ask me, Chike, not much of a difference.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.480
Use your Magnagrip glove
to launch the thudball at the Centurions.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.560
Game on!

19:17.480 --> 19:19.760
The Clunk-a-matic.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.920
Oh, yeah! Taser-jab!

19:36.160 --> 19:38.280
-Is that...
-Mangle?

19:38.840 --> 19:40.000
And me.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.680
We’re here to...

19:42.760 --> 19:44.120
[grunts and groans]

19:44.200 --> 19:46.200
...save you. [gasps]

19:48.040 --> 19:49.200
[grunts]

19:53.800 --> 19:55.240
This way! Let’s go!

19:56.560 --> 19:57.920
-Hurry!
-[Feronia] Run!

19:58.760 --> 20:00.800
-Go! I’ll cover you.
-But--

20:00.880 --> 20:02.640
-Go!
-Okay!

20:07.200 --> 20:08.400
Argh!

20:08.480 --> 20:09.360
[grunts]

20:13.440 --> 20:14.480
[grunts]

20:17.240 --> 20:20.040
-Mangle protect.
-Thanks, Mangle.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.360
[gasps]

20:25.400 --> 20:26.440
[Livia] Let's go!

20:26.920 --> 20:28.360
Feronia!

20:29.040 --> 20:31.480
The box! Find the box!

20:31.560 --> 20:33.600
No!

20:33.920 --> 20:36.760
Leave the rest. We’ve got their leader.

20:39.560 --> 20:40.400
[gasps]

20:40.960 --> 20:43.800
Hello, Feronia.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.680
[sighs]

20:59.400 --> 21:02.720
Mangle, come here. The box, I’ve found it.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.000
Oh!

21:09.320 --> 21:11.680
Uh, what am I supposed to do with this?

21:12.480 --> 21:13.640
-Oh!
-Hm?

21:19.280 --> 21:22.120
Okay, wasn’t expecting that.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.400
[whirring]

21:23.480 --> 21:24.680
[groans]

21:24.760 --> 21:28.200
Mangle? Mangle? Mangle!

21:28.680 --> 21:30.040
[powers up]

21:30.920 --> 21:36.200
Mangle... Combatabot!

21:36.280 --> 21:37.360
Whoa!
