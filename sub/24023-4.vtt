WEBVTT

00:00.539 --> 00:01.785
Previously on Harrow...

00:01.821 --> 00:04.465
Where are you?
-Airlie Beach. Work.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.740
Who with?
-Nichols.

00:09.380 --> 00:12.065
You're the Phys Ed teacher.
-Jesse Walsh.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.300
Stephanie Tolson.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.164
How is he?
-He misses you.

00:17.405 --> 00:18.527
He quit?

00:18.848 --> 00:22.013
He really was quitting and then...

00:22.400 --> 00:26.591
I love him, but your Dad's
a kind of a selfish guy, Fern.

00:26.892 --> 00:29.585
Boats, open water, escape.

00:29.620 --> 00:30.620
Yeah.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.520
I need a really accurate idea
of how long he's been in the river.

00:38.420 --> 00:40.785
Look at this. It's a serial number.

00:40.820 --> 00:43.760
We can look this up and find out
exactly who this guy is.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.985
It's near some excellent schools

00:48.020 --> 00:49.985
and very close to the bus stops.

00:50.020 --> 00:52.945
And there's a large
backyard for the kids.

00:52.980 --> 00:55.464
OK. Boys?

00:56.166 --> 00:57.425
I'm gonna get you.

00:57.460 --> 00:59.023
How much is it a week?

00:59.059 --> 01:01.465
$720. But they may negotiate.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.905
When were the floors polished?

01:02.940 --> 01:05.545
A couple of years ago,
but they hold up well.

01:05.580 --> 01:08.740
Eli. Thomas. Outside, please.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.265
It has been vacant for some time, but...

01:12.300 --> 01:13.544
Hey, Eli. Look.

01:16.372 --> 01:19.953
Check it out. Wanna climb it?
-Dad will kill us.

01:20.140 --> 01:22.420
Come on. It's just next door.

01:25.360 --> 01:28.005
Race you to the top.
-Get out of the way.

01:28.140 --> 01:32.385
I'm gonna win.
-I can't get up. Eli.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.280
Eli.

01:34.710 --> 01:36.955
Hey. You can't be here.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.945
Get out of here or you'll be sorry.

01:39.980 --> 01:43.665
I'm gonna throttle you little
bastards. Get off my property.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.074
Go on, get.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.869 --> 02:39.674
I thought you might do this.

02:39.940 --> 02:41.705
Steal the radius plate, hide out here,

02:41.740 --> 02:44.065
then when I go looking for you,
you slip back inside

02:44.100 --> 02:46.140
and take all the credit
with the lovely Soroya Dass.

02:47.340 --> 02:48.785
Am I that transparent?

02:48.820 --> 02:51.306
"Dr Harrow, what a find."

02:51.900 --> 02:53.105
"You're so clever and so strong

02:53.140 --> 02:55.345
"and I'm sure your
plenipotentiary instrument is..."

02:55.380 --> 02:57.785
Disturbed by your
assistant's reference to it.

02:57.820 --> 02:58.946
Unless of course she already knows

02:58.981 --> 03:01.625
how your plenipotentiary instrument
is after North Queensland.

03:01.660 --> 03:04.345
The only thing that Dass
knows about me after North Queensland

03:04.380 --> 03:06.692
is how much I do not
like North Queensland.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.053
Then take the credit for the plate.

03:08.198 --> 03:10.603
Far be it for me to stand in the way
of a romance in blossom.

03:10.639 --> 03:13.645
In blossom? The only thing
in blossom is a letter of dismissal.

03:13.681 --> 03:15.367
Then why are you
wearing your good shirt?

03:18.060 --> 03:19.186
Happened to be at hand.

03:19.221 --> 03:20.926
With your other one ruined
when Dass tore it off.

03:21.460 --> 03:25.025
You and David really have to stop
reading Fifty Shades of Innuendo.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.225
I don't plan on seeing
Sergeant Dass today.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.740
Too bad. She's in Exam 1.

03:32.465 --> 03:33.830
Found him.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.945
For a man with such
a cheery disposition,

03:36.981 --> 03:38.629
your boss sure has a lot of blues.

03:38.665 --> 03:40.070
You'd be surprised.

03:40.540 --> 03:43.305
So, what did you find
that's so exciting?

03:43.340 --> 03:46.705
Simon found this in the
river bones concrete.

03:46.740 --> 03:50.105
It's a Radius Compression Plate.
-So, our John Doe had a broken wrist.

03:50.140 --> 03:51.186
How does that help us?

03:51.221 --> 03:52.905
Allow me to show you the good news.

03:52.940 --> 03:54.538
Thank you.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.635
Take a look at this.

03:56.744 --> 03:58.744
A serial number.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.140
You handsome, clever man.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.985
Kiriakos has cancelled my
dive time, so no skull.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.145
But with this...
-We'll find our guy.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.385
So, who keeps the
serial numbers on file?

04:11.420 --> 04:12.865
Hospitals? Manufacturers?

04:12.900 --> 04:14.105
Now tell her the bad news.

04:14.140 --> 04:15.425
Well, like the boss,

04:15.460 --> 04:18.541
this model is pretty old and
has a very shady background.

04:18.940 --> 04:20.345
It's a Simi-Tech model from the '90s,

04:20.380 --> 04:22.767
and Simi-Tech went bankrupt years ago.

04:22.803 --> 04:26.025
OK, so I take it back to Scientific?
Start calling hospitals?

04:26.060 --> 04:29.025
No, let us chase this one up.
We'll be faster.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.625
But I've got the long arm of the law.

04:30.948 --> 04:33.471
But we know the medico system.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.712
Have you photographed this?

04:34.980 --> 04:36.740
Yeah, photographed,
catalogued and backed up.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.140
OK.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.265
Let's see who's faster.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.380
Bye.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.825
A race to identify a bone plate
pulled from a dead guy's skeleton.

04:48.860 --> 04:50.425
How erotic.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.905
I should let you do it.
-Fine, I'll do it.

04:52.940 --> 04:54.625
I will do it.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.077
You <i>want</i> to do it.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.660
Go and sterilise something, will you?

04:59.789 --> 05:01.349
I'm putting my money on Dass.

05:04.780 --> 05:07.585
I suspected you like older women,
Fairley, but there are limits.

05:07.620 --> 05:10.305
It's a gift from the
symposium committee,

05:10.340 --> 05:13.068
gratitude for my outstanding
keynote address,

05:13.104 --> 05:15.749
the full video of which is now trending.

05:15.785 --> 05:18.105
On morenumbingthanvalium.com?

05:18.140 --> 05:20.225
On the Orthopaedics International Forum.

05:20.260 --> 05:22.985
Listen, bone expert...
-Don't mock me.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.804
I wasn't.

05:25.140 --> 05:26.465
Simi-Tech ortho plates.

05:26.662 --> 05:28.813
Yes, they went out of business.
-I know.

05:28.849 --> 05:30.465
They're bankrupt.
-I know.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.785
So why are we still talking?

05:31.820 --> 05:35.545
Which hospital did ortho surgeons
work out of in the '90s?

05:35.580 --> 05:38.260
St Catherine's. Excuse us.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.225
Unfortunately, the company
who were doing the filing

05:44.260 --> 05:46.745
were sacked, so nothing
has been digitised.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.620
You have to search for
everything by hand.

05:51.557 --> 05:52.860
All of it?

05:53.949 --> 05:55.914
Is there any sort of system?

05:55.950 --> 05:58.580
By year, patient or surgeon?

05:59.722 --> 06:01.075
It is sorted by year.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.625
Do you have any idea about
what year you're looking for?

06:03.660 --> 06:05.180
No.

06:06.494 --> 06:07.979
Is there any other way?

06:08.015 --> 06:10.785
Well, you could track down
all of the ortho surgeons

06:10.820 --> 06:12.225
that worked here in the '90s

06:12.260 --> 06:14.385
and then ask for their individual files,

06:14.420 --> 06:17.013
but I don't know how you'd do that.

06:17.049 --> 06:19.374
I'll leave you to it.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.460
Thanks, Meredith.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.020
Come on, Jack.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.532
Round one to Harrow.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.020
Meredith told me a shabby man
from the morgue had beaten me to it.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.145
Welcome to a year's worth of sifting.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.065
You know, I quite like Meredith's idea

06:50.100 --> 06:51.860
of tracking down the ortho surgeons.

06:53.300 --> 06:54.745
Good old Meredith.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.649
So, you starting that now?

06:56.692 --> 06:59.412
Nope. Nor are you. Work beckons.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.185
I don't want you coming in my house.

07:03.220 --> 07:06.025
How many times, and you're
not coming in, alright?

07:06.060 --> 07:08.425
We have to come in.
We have to search the house.

07:08.460 --> 07:09.705
Well, you're not coming in without...

07:09.740 --> 07:11.705
I tell you what, mate,
you need a search warrant.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.305
Don't you know the rules?
-Yes, I know.

07:13.340 --> 07:14.588
You know the rules? Well I don't care.

07:14.624 --> 07:15.659
Here's the warrant.

07:15.695 --> 07:16.749
Harrow.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.597
You're not coming in my house.

07:21.060 --> 07:22.501
What do you think?

07:22.537 --> 07:24.199
Two years? Three?

07:25.340 --> 07:26.860
Three, four, five.

07:27.578 --> 07:32.263
So that's where she laid, but animals
have scattered the rest all over.

07:32.299 --> 07:33.664
She?

07:33.700 --> 07:36.585
Judging by the pelvic bone. She.

07:36.940 --> 07:41.465
So, she's been lying here for years,
in the elements, unnoticed?

07:41.500 --> 07:43.585
Or noticed but unreported.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.305
You're not comin' in my house.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.905
He's a drunk.

07:46.940 --> 07:48.305
Well, he may not have known.

07:48.340 --> 07:51.105
Or he knew, because he put her here.
-Now get off my property.

07:51.140 --> 07:52.864
He must have smelt it.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.806
Well, we are a long way from the house.

07:55.842 --> 07:59.287
I doubt he'd smell it
if a camel died on his back porch.

07:59.540 --> 08:00.745
Hey, Sarge.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.545
Why don't you go away
and stop bothering me?

08:02.580 --> 08:03.556
Found some clothing.

08:03.581 --> 08:05.425
You've got no right to come around here.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.140
Looks like a shirt and a belt.

08:10.420 --> 08:13.277
Blood.

08:13.430 --> 08:15.035
Let's take a look in the house.

08:15.340 --> 08:16.745
Bloody hell,

08:16.780 --> 08:19.105
you're making this more difficult
than it needs to be, Mr Connelly.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.905
Why won't you open the cupboard?

08:20.940 --> 08:23.545
It's my private stuff.
-Yeah. I'm aware of that.

08:23.580 --> 08:26.225
But you know there's a dead
woman in your backyard?

08:26.260 --> 08:29.265
No, I didn't know there was
a dead woman in my backyard,

08:29.300 --> 08:30.346
and I told you that.

08:30.381 --> 08:32.073
So, when did your wife go missing?

08:32.109 --> 08:35.464
I've told you that.
Jesus, five years ago.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.379
Right. And why didn't you
report her missing?

08:38.414 --> 08:40.693
Because it's nobody's bloody bus...

08:41.288 --> 08:44.810
Hey. Don't go in there. Stop.

08:45.519 --> 08:48.519
Please. Stop. Don't go in there.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.040
How much are you drinking
each day, Mr Connelly?

08:53.140 --> 08:55.345
That's nobody's business either.
-OK.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.745
The search warrant covers the cupboard.

08:56.780 --> 08:59.278
Now, either you open it,
or we'll force it open.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.265
It's my stuff.
-Alright.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.900
Andy? Sort that lock out.

09:30.519 --> 09:32.670
_

09:40.260 --> 09:41.748
Jack?

09:44.053 --> 09:45.818
Your phone been playing up?

09:45.854 --> 09:49.134
No, just some of the callers.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.540
Here's some more supplies.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.520
You wanna talk about it?

10:01.180 --> 10:04.295
Do you?
-Not yet.

10:11.675 --> 10:13.171
Simi-Tech.

10:13.518 --> 10:15.043
Why did they go bankrupt?

10:15.079 --> 10:17.465
Simi-Tech used to make
some pretty good gear

10:17.500 --> 10:21.585
until they had a bunch of
plates made in Estonia?

10:21.620 --> 10:23.180
No, Armenia.

10:24.966 --> 10:27.811
The plates caused all sorts of problems,

10:27.847 --> 10:32.507
resulting in a class action
against a few ortho surgeons.

10:33.374 --> 10:35.499
You would have known which ones.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.705
Would this have anything to do

10:37.740 --> 10:41.140
with your nocturnal visit to
the recently departed Hovard?

10:42.485 --> 10:43.845
Yeah.

10:45.653 --> 10:47.778
I'll have to look
in my little black book.

10:47.846 --> 10:49.566
I'll get you some names.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.320
What is this place?
-It's safe. Come on.

10:57.917 --> 10:59.882
Aaron says he's crashed
here a couple of times.

11:00.299 --> 11:02.459
Yeah?
-It'll be fine.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.245
No-one seemed to appreciate music today.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.120
How did you go?

11:12.300 --> 11:15.000
You know, one guy offered me
five bucks to play Nickelback?

11:25.150 --> 11:26.220
Here.

11:29.740 --> 11:30.985
Yeah, nah, I mean,

11:31.020 --> 11:32.705
Fish, the bond alone would have to be...

11:32.740 --> 11:33.866
$720.

11:34.162 --> 11:36.361
And another fortnight's rent in advance.

11:36.949 --> 11:38.554
This is, like, half.

11:38.590 --> 11:42.113
We just need to go
somewhere safe. Just us.

11:42.303 --> 11:45.148
Just need to work harder
and make some money.

11:45.540 --> 11:47.540
And that's what you want?
-Yeah.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.360
OK.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.025
What's that?

11:57.445 --> 12:00.105
Well, I missed your birthday

12:00.140 --> 12:01.905
because you didn't tell me.

12:01.940 --> 12:04.385
And I saw the photo of you and your Dad.

12:04.420 --> 12:07.940
You looked so happy in it, so...

12:10.460 --> 12:12.420
It's the same book from the photo.

12:33.940 --> 12:36.110
That's weird.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.020
What's weird?

12:39.460 --> 12:42.665
Some bones are missing, but
most of them are from this hand.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.496
Animals?
-Why just one hand?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.905
How old did you say
the missing wife was?

12:47.940 --> 12:48.916
51.

12:48.941 --> 12:51.028
Well, the skeleton looks
to be late middle aged.

12:51.420 --> 12:55.625
This is a mild vertebral fracture.

12:56.124 --> 12:57.636
And there's another one here.

12:57.672 --> 13:00.105
And you can see we've
got bone thinning here.

13:00.140 --> 13:03.106
Osteoporosis? Consistent
with late middle age.

13:03.142 --> 13:05.667
Perhaps, but come take a look at this.

13:05.773 --> 13:08.178
Her teeth are full of caries.

13:08.214 --> 13:10.594
Poor dental hygiene.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.580
So we check the Public Dental Clinic.

13:13.541 --> 13:17.586
Sure, but bad teeth, poor diet.

13:17.622 --> 13:23.027
What if she's not 51, but 31, with
early onset brought on by poverty,

13:23.063 --> 13:24.476
by a really tough life?

13:24.540 --> 13:27.180
So you're saying you don't think
it's Connelly's missing wife?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.165
Do you know what I think's weird?

13:30.366 --> 13:33.745
I think it's weird that you think
an alcoholic with PTSD

13:33.780 --> 13:36.426
and a cupboard full of knives
and a dead lady in his backyard

13:36.462 --> 13:37.747
isn't a killer.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.185
Well. He might be a killer,

13:39.220 --> 13:41.425
or he might just be bad
at lawn maintenance.

13:41.460 --> 13:42.626
OK.

13:42.661 --> 13:44.825
So we check the systems
and the public dental records

13:44.860 --> 13:46.381
and we see who's right.

13:48.941 --> 13:50.146
Are you OK?

13:50.968 --> 13:53.020
Yeah, I'm great.

13:55.533 --> 13:57.778
Wait.
-What?

13:58.020 --> 13:59.580
Endocam.

14:01.020 --> 14:02.500
There.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.145
A sharp blade could have done that.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.980
Have you got her shirt?

14:23.820 --> 14:25.205
Stabbed.

14:25.820 --> 14:27.745
Stabbed woman, lots of knives.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.510
I'll let Nichols know.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.360
Can you give us a hand, Simon?
-Yeah.

14:52.129 --> 14:54.793
So, you think the murder weapon
is a double-bladed knife?

14:55.340 --> 14:58.180
A boot knife. Standard
issue to most soldiers.

14:59.060 --> 15:03.380
Only problem is, I didn't see one
in the suspect's knife collection.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.305
So, we've seen the last four tenants

15:08.340 --> 15:11.323
who lived in the rental home
next door to Mr Connelly.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.345
Now, who's next?
-Cassandra Dalton.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.585
Six month lease.

15:15.620 --> 15:17.249
Right.
-Four years ago.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.145
Cassandra Dalton.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.625
My. Beautiful woman, Bryan.

15:21.660 --> 15:22.945
If you are going to swipe right,

15:22.980 --> 15:24.745
you do know you have
to do it on a phone?

15:24.780 --> 15:26.500
Piss off, Harrow.

15:27.247 --> 15:29.864
What do you want?
-Are these Connelly's neighbours?

15:29.900 --> 15:32.905
Who rented the house next door
over the last six years, yes.

15:32.940 --> 15:33.916
And?

15:33.941 --> 15:36.825
Well, so far, about as useful
as an ashtray on a motorbike.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.185
Nobody saw anything.

15:38.220 --> 15:39.780
Why are you here?

15:40.820 --> 15:42.585
Do you remember
seeing something like this

15:42.620 --> 15:44.100
in Connelly's knife collection?

15:45.300 --> 15:46.865
Nothing like that.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.140
Do you think this killed our victim?
-I do.

15:49.894 --> 15:52.352
OK. Ta.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.720
Now, off you go.

15:58.126 --> 15:59.371
Julie.

15:59.407 --> 16:01.951
Mr Connelly?

16:02.701 --> 16:03.701
Hello.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.380
Mr Connelly?

16:10.540 --> 16:12.740
I'm not with the police.
I'm with the Coroner's office.

16:14.076 --> 16:16.257
Mr Connelly, are you home?

16:19.486 --> 16:21.726
Hello? Mr Connelly?

16:22.688 --> 16:24.533
Jesus.

16:24.569 --> 16:26.894
Mr Connelly.

16:26.959 --> 16:29.399
No, no, no, you don't.

16:32.805 --> 16:34.010
Come on.

16:34.340 --> 16:35.580
Let's get this off.

16:42.980 --> 16:46.180
It's alright, Mr Connelly.
We'll have you at the hospital soon.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.340
What makes you so sure he's good for it?

16:55.380 --> 16:58.740
You had one in your family,
didn't you? A drinker.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.545
Every family's got something.

17:01.973 --> 17:03.493
Here.

17:04.420 --> 17:07.619
The search of the Public Dental
Clinic brought up a match.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.984
And that's not Connelly's wife.

17:11.020 --> 17:12.900
Well, doesn't mean
Connelly didn't kill her.

17:15.156 --> 17:16.163
Who is she?

17:16.199 --> 17:19.203
Sally Chenery. 31. Long-term homeless.

17:19.420 --> 17:21.500
We're a long way
from the homeless shelters.

17:22.619 --> 17:25.944
Long rap sheet for public
nuisance, mental health.

17:25.980 --> 17:29.505
13 years ago she served six
months for abducting a toddler.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.065
Why only six months?

17:31.100 --> 17:32.830
She gave him back the next day.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.460
Anyway, Sally was reported
missing four years ago.

17:38.180 --> 17:39.620
Who reported her missing?

17:41.780 --> 17:43.505
I first met her after I got funding

17:43.540 --> 17:45.797
to make a documentary on homelessness.

17:46.420 --> 17:49.065
Sally was one of the people
who agreed to be interviewed.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.305
We started filming with her,

17:50.340 --> 17:52.305
but she left suddenly
and I couldn't find her,

17:52.340 --> 17:54.265
so I reported her missing.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.900
I brought some footage with me.

18:01.620 --> 18:02.985
This is just the raw footage.

18:03.020 --> 18:04.985
OK. When you're ready.

18:05.020 --> 18:09.025
My name's Sally. I'm homeless.

18:09.060 --> 18:11.665
That means a lot of people have
already made up their mind about me

18:11.700 --> 18:13.540
before they know anything about me.

18:15.020 --> 18:17.100
Crim. Druggie. Grub.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.290
I don't want this life.

18:20.326 --> 18:22.771
I want what everyone wants.

18:22.807 --> 18:24.890
I want a home.

18:24.926 --> 18:26.526
I want a job.

18:28.077 --> 18:29.552
I want my family.

18:30.820 --> 18:32.745
No-one will give me a chance, you know?

18:32.780 --> 18:34.300
No-one will believe me.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.307
Come on, we gotta go.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.225
I don't want to.
-Come on.

18:39.260 --> 18:40.620
We're goin'.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.059
Pause it.

18:44.420 --> 18:45.945
Who's that?
-I don't know.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.225
He wouldn't talk to me.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.380
Go back to where he grabs her
then move it forward frame by frame.

18:52.780 --> 18:54.305
Come on, we gotta go.
-I don't want to.

18:54.340 --> 18:55.745
Come on, we're goin'.

18:55.780 --> 18:56.931
Stop.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.961
That tattoo on his hand.

18:59.357 --> 19:02.001
There.
-Yeah, we can search knownies for that.

19:02.047 --> 19:03.452
You didn't speak to him?

19:03.488 --> 19:05.625
No. I wonder if he might be the father.

19:05.660 --> 19:06.636
Father?

19:06.661 --> 19:08.865
The baby she said was
taken away from her.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.740
The one she said she used to sing to.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.505
15 years ago, Sally was admitted
to hospital with influenza.

19:15.540 --> 19:16.586
She had a baby with her,

19:16.621 --> 19:19.817
an unregistered baby that wasn't
born in the hospital system.

19:20.142 --> 19:22.467
So the Registrar
ordered a maternity test?

19:22.503 --> 19:25.049
Which determined
Sally wasn't the mother.

19:25.085 --> 19:26.545
Mistake, maybe?

19:26.580 --> 19:29.105
The hospital did
two rounds of DNA tests.

19:29.140 --> 19:32.025
Child Services did a third
before they took the baby away.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.480
Soroya Dass.

19:41.420 --> 19:43.680
It's just over here, next to the fence.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.265
Does it get boring,
being right all the time?

19:49.940 --> 19:53.420
Not all the time. Just on work days.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.265
This is gonna be Connelly's knife

19:56.300 --> 19:58.460
and Nichols is going to charge him.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.380
Hey, um, must be time for that drink.

20:14.957 --> 20:16.602
Coming.

20:16.638 --> 20:18.158
You're early.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.025
Jesse.
-Stephanie Quinn?

20:26.833 --> 20:27.983
Tolson.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.226
14 days to pay, or it's court.

20:30.262 --> 20:34.260
I have told you people,
this is not my debt.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.900
Not mine either, love. 14 days.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.605
Hey. You OK?

20:54.840 --> 20:56.885
Yeah. Listen, where are you?

20:57.020 --> 20:59.145
Baxter's. Why?

20:59.181 --> 21:00.986
I need a favour.

21:01.180 --> 21:03.705
I don't like doing this...
-It's fine.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.105
..having to do this.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.945
I'll pay you back.
-It's fine, it's fine.

21:06.980 --> 21:08.531
Don't worry about it.

21:08.710 --> 21:10.035
How did you get here?

21:10.133 --> 21:12.898
A friend. I'd... better go.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.025
Haven't spoken to Fern, have you?

21:15.060 --> 21:16.705
Have you?
-No.

21:16.740 --> 21:17.900
Hi.

21:18.769 --> 21:21.180
I was just parking and I saw you, so...

21:22.780 --> 21:25.820
This is Stephanie Tolson, my...

21:26.820 --> 21:28.545
Ex-wife.
-Hi.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.985
This is Soroya Dass, new SOCO.

21:31.020 --> 21:32.625
Right.
-Hi.

21:32.660 --> 21:33.636
Hi.

21:33.661 --> 21:35.905
I bet you're glad you missed
out on having to go to Airlie Beach

21:35.940 --> 21:37.145
with that crocodile business.

21:37.180 --> 21:40.262
I did go to Airlie Beach
with that crocodile business.

21:40.703 --> 21:42.718
Sorry to interrupt.

21:43.011 --> 21:46.860
I was worried, but,
I can see you're OK now.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.060
This is your friend.

21:52.180 --> 21:55.105
We should go and... have a drink.
-No.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.025
Yes.
-I don't mind.

21:57.060 --> 21:58.785
Yeah.

21:58.820 --> 21:59.820
Great.

22:01.540 --> 22:03.385
Have you noticed the way
he does this with his fingers

22:03.421 --> 22:05.106
when he's thinking?

22:05.142 --> 22:06.987
The thing is, he does that
when he's not thinking.

22:07.100 --> 22:08.785
He does it a lot.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.305
I don't do that.

22:10.340 --> 22:11.820
You're doing it now.

22:13.500 --> 22:17.305
So, Soroya, Scenes of Crime.
You work with dead bodies?

22:17.340 --> 22:19.785
Sometimes. Hence Forensic Pathologists.

22:19.820 --> 22:23.345
It's not so much work for Daniel
as a way to show that he's right.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.025
I'm not always right.

22:25.060 --> 22:26.146
And that he knows things.

22:26.181 --> 22:27.465
I do know things.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.345
It makes you wonder, though,
how a man who can hear once

22:30.380 --> 22:34.823
about a 15th century harpsichord
from some royal orchestra museum...

22:34.859 --> 22:37.144
That's the clavicytherium
from the Royal College of Music.

22:37.540 --> 22:38.785
..can remember that,

22:38.820 --> 22:41.505
but you tell him about his
daughter's dance recital nine times

22:41.540 --> 22:42.865
and he still misses it.

22:42.900 --> 22:43.900
Ooh.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.545
Smokers, obviously.

22:48.580 --> 22:50.025
Reformed.

22:50.060 --> 22:51.106
Grammar Nazis.

22:51.141 --> 22:52.945
Misuse of apostrophes.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.146
Well, how hard is it

22:54.181 --> 22:56.105
to separate a possessive
pronoun from a contraction?

22:56.140 --> 22:59.385
Guys who have to point
out logic flaws in films...

22:59.420 --> 23:00.945
Right in the middle of the film.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.665
Yes.
-Yes.

23:02.700 --> 23:06.905
So, Daniel, how did you manage
to convince this lovely woman,

23:06.940 --> 23:09.465
who you obviously irritate,

23:09.500 --> 23:10.546
into marrying you?

23:10.581 --> 23:12.269
It was a long time ago.

23:12.305 --> 23:13.467
I was 21.

23:13.503 --> 23:16.140
I'd just started my
first year of teaching,

23:16.305 --> 23:21.390
and my parents both
died in a car accident.

23:21.687 --> 23:25.452
I had to go and identify them
and Daniel was the one there.

23:25.488 --> 23:30.613
And he was so gentle
with them, my parents.

23:30.649 --> 23:32.574
So caring.

23:32.610 --> 23:37.055
And he was honest about
how they died, and that helped.

23:37.499 --> 23:42.584
And then he called me every
day for the next six months,

23:42.620 --> 23:44.420
just to make sure I was OK.

23:45.620 --> 23:47.849
And then I wouldn't let him go.

23:50.020 --> 23:51.340
A long time ago.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.320
We should be on our way.
Might lose our table.

24:01.320 --> 24:04.340
It was nice to meet you, Soroya.
-Yeah, you too.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.065
Steph's nice.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.300
Do you still love her?

24:24.720 --> 24:25.880
Yeah.

24:27.380 --> 24:30.360
But it's an old love
that's run its race.

24:32.032 --> 24:33.977
Why'd you lie to her, then?

24:34.013 --> 24:35.653
About being up north with me?

24:38.020 --> 24:39.168
I don't know.

24:41.009 --> 24:44.220
It's been six years
since I've divorced but...

24:46.540 --> 24:48.500
This is the first time I've felt...

24:51.302 --> 24:54.307
I thought you were smart
and you knew things.

24:54.343 --> 24:56.260
God.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.260
I'm so sorry.

25:13.620 --> 25:15.020
Sorry.

25:16.620 --> 25:18.187
It's my sister. I...

25:18.420 --> 25:19.500
I have to go.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.680
Sorry.

25:35.260 --> 25:37.225
You're still parking illegally up there.

25:37.260 --> 25:39.825
Piss off.
-I should report you.

25:39.860 --> 25:41.985
It's illegal to beg. I'd report you.

25:42.020 --> 25:45.340
You'd be an arsehole.
-And you'd be a bigger arsehole.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.465
Lindsay, where have you been?

25:49.500 --> 25:50.945
I haven't seen you around for a while.

25:50.980 --> 25:52.660
Around. Here and there.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.700
It's pretty cold, Linds.

25:56.534 --> 25:58.379
Still got that bunk on the boat.

25:58.415 --> 26:00.540
Nah, I don't like confined spaces.

26:00.900 --> 26:02.420
Well, the offer's always there.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.145
Hey, listen.

26:05.180 --> 26:07.865
I need to find someone

26:07.900 --> 26:10.625
who was on the streets a few years ago.

26:10.660 --> 26:11.706
This guy stands out.

26:11.741 --> 26:16.340
He's six foot four, big trench coat,
a tattoo of a black sun on his hand.

26:17.365 --> 26:18.930
I think he might have hurt someone.

26:18.966 --> 26:20.940
Hurt them bad, if you're involved.

26:21.973 --> 26:24.452
Six foot four. Black sun.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.060
I'll ask around.

26:27.365 --> 26:29.090
It's dangerous out here.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.820
People don't appreciate that.

26:40.213 --> 26:42.461
_

26:58.060 --> 26:59.825
Call. Baby.

26:59.860 --> 27:00.836
Baby.
-What?

27:00.861 --> 27:02.100
What?
-We gotta get out of here.

27:03.980 --> 27:05.865
Hey, who's that?

27:05.900 --> 27:07.665
Hey, you two, stop.

27:07.700 --> 27:09.540
Stop.
-Sorry, mate.

27:10.145 --> 27:13.060
Oi, you two. Get back here.

27:14.143 --> 27:15.748
Fish.

27:16.038 --> 27:17.718
Slow down.

27:18.894 --> 27:19.894
Stop.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.340
Hey.

27:23.396 --> 27:25.601
Fish...
-We can't keep doing this.

27:25.637 --> 27:27.841
Doing what?
-This.

27:28.620 --> 27:30.340
Sleeping in strange places. I can't.

27:31.638 --> 27:33.038
Here, come on.

27:35.077 --> 27:36.757
Just come here.

27:40.085 --> 27:41.756
Why do you get like this?

27:45.400 --> 27:47.000
Why do you freak out?

27:49.220 --> 27:50.860
You can tell me.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.517
That was...

28:10.790 --> 28:11.875
Different.

28:15.126 --> 28:17.285
Jesse?
-What?

28:18.318 --> 28:20.349
I didn't leave the side gate open.

28:25.420 --> 28:26.900
The shed's unlocked.

28:48.220 --> 28:50.020
I'll leave you to it.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.560
See ya.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.340
Harrow.
-What?

29:24.900 --> 29:27.032
You alright?
-Yeah, great, mate.

29:27.340 --> 29:29.665
Got a name for your sun tattoo.

29:29.700 --> 29:32.300
Bill Ritson. Been doing
community service.

29:35.180 --> 29:38.524
We found Sally's remains
in a suburban backyard.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.765
Is there anything you can
tell us about what happened?

29:40.801 --> 29:42.966
Do I have to make a statement?

29:43.220 --> 29:44.226
Some time.

29:44.261 --> 29:45.985
You were pretty rough
with her on that video.

29:46.020 --> 29:48.705
I was just angry with her 'cause
she wouldn't look after herself.

29:48.740 --> 29:51.345
All she cared about
was taking her photos

29:51.554 --> 29:53.117
and getting her boy back.

29:53.475 --> 29:56.805
You weren't the father?
-Nah, it was long before me.

29:56.841 --> 29:58.526
I don't think Sal knew herself.

29:59.297 --> 30:02.193
She was always disappearing,
you know? Looking for him.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.825
And then she got sick.
-With what?

30:04.860 --> 30:06.657
She didn't like to talk about it.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.105
I remember that documentary day.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.025
She had an appointment at the hospital.

30:11.385 --> 30:14.345
She didn't wanna go. So I took her.

30:15.062 --> 30:17.747
A few days later, she was gone.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.794
All she took was her camera.

30:20.574 --> 30:22.174
I never saw her again.

30:35.380 --> 30:38.200
I want a home. I want a job.

30:39.980 --> 30:41.620
I want my family.

30:44.580 --> 30:47.185
No-one will give me a chance.
No-one will believe me.

30:47.815 --> 30:50.215
It's Sunday. I have a grading.

30:50.934 --> 30:52.680
What's so important?

30:53.039 --> 30:55.545
The bandits are coming,
but we can only pay in rice.

30:55.580 --> 30:57.185
You see...

30:57.220 --> 30:59.145
I think I missed something.

30:59.863 --> 31:03.545
And I need a second opinion from
a world-renowned osteology expert.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.265
This bone thinning.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.145
I thought it was early
onset osteoporosis,

31:11.180 --> 31:14.545
brought on by poor diet, poor health.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.269
That's a fair conclusion.

31:16.740 --> 31:18.225
But...?

31:18.260 --> 31:20.185
Osteolytic lesions.

31:20.220 --> 31:24.385
Could be as a result of
abdomino-pelvic disease or...

31:24.420 --> 31:25.546
Or...?

31:25.581 --> 31:28.985
Ovarian cancer that
metastasised into the bone.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.085
Ovarian cancer.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.940
Thank you, Lyle.

31:37.980 --> 31:40.465
This is Simon. You know what to do.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.693
Hey, it's me.

31:43.100 --> 31:46.425
I need you to go to the oncology
department at Prince Edward's

31:46.460 --> 31:49.700
and see if Sally Chenery ever
presented there for cancer treatment.

31:50.549 --> 31:52.612
And if so, I'll need her files.

31:53.820 --> 31:56.945
Most people, they don't even look at me.

31:56.980 --> 31:58.865
They just keep their eyes to the ground

31:58.900 --> 32:02.300
'cause they know that if they look
up, they might see me and then...

32:54.540 --> 32:55.540
Nice work.

33:02.100 --> 33:03.625
Pentax K1000.

33:03.660 --> 33:05.425
They made, like, three million of these.

33:05.460 --> 33:06.887
Is there film in it?

33:07.580 --> 33:10.345
Umm... Yes.

33:10.380 --> 33:11.865
Don't get your hopes up.

33:11.900 --> 33:14.065
It's been out here
for years in the rain.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.505
There might be a photo
of whoever killed her.

33:16.893 --> 33:19.025
Do you think she was put up here?

33:19.060 --> 33:22.180
Lift a body up here?

33:24.460 --> 33:26.345
So, she was stabbed,

33:26.380 --> 33:28.905
splenic artery severed, bleeding out.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.985
She knew it was bad,
but she climbed anyway.

33:32.020 --> 33:34.337
Maybe to escape her killer.
-Maybe.

33:34.581 --> 33:38.595
And then she dies up here,
skin and flesh fall off,

33:39.174 --> 33:41.054
but this hand remains.

33:42.374 --> 33:45.254
These branches. How do we
find out how old they are?

33:45.940 --> 33:48.464
So, they're actually
called water sprouts.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.385
And you're quite right, Dr Harrow,

33:50.420 --> 33:53.945
they're shoots that arise from,
like, main trunks and branches.

33:53.980 --> 33:56.580
And in this case, from where
a branch was removed.

33:59.880 --> 34:02.760
Maybe it was to give a better
view of the house next door.

34:04.260 --> 34:09.000
Actually, it reminds me of a rather
funny limerick about water sprouts.

34:09.456 --> 34:12.145
A plant of unusual genus

34:12.179 --> 34:15.344
reminded a lass of a...
-How old are those water sprouts?

34:15.380 --> 34:16.900
Let me see.

34:22.380 --> 34:25.385
I'd say about four years.

34:25.420 --> 34:28.380
So, do we know who lived
next door four years ago?

34:30.179 --> 34:33.745
Cassandra Dalton? You used
to be Mr Connelly's neighbour?

34:33.780 --> 34:35.960
I was wondering if we could
ask you a couple of questions.

34:35.996 --> 34:38.922
I thought I was clear when I
spoke to Detective Nichols.

34:39.036 --> 34:40.601
I never saw or heard anything.

34:40.638 --> 34:42.322
Well, now we have a face.

34:42.359 --> 34:44.324
Did you ever see that woman

34:44.360 --> 34:46.784
in Mr Connelly's yard, or
around the neighbourhood?

34:46.820 --> 34:50.025
Sorry. I'm sure I'd remember.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.945
Hey, Mum, have you seen my other...

34:53.494 --> 34:56.665
I just lost my other one.

34:56.699 --> 34:59.905
What about you? What's your name?
-Noah... Dalton.

34:59.940 --> 35:01.545
Hi, Noah.

35:01.580 --> 35:03.380
Do you recognise this lady?

35:05.700 --> 35:08.665
No. Sorry.
-I think we're done.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.780
Noah, is this your Mum?

35:12.509 --> 35:14.709
Yes.
-We're done.

35:18.580 --> 35:19.785
What was that?

35:19.820 --> 35:22.020
How old was that boy? 15?
-I guess.

35:23.020 --> 35:24.705
Remember Sally's rap sheet?

35:24.740 --> 35:27.145
She kidnapped a toddler 13 years ago.

35:27.180 --> 35:28.385
A two-year-old, yeah.

35:28.420 --> 35:31.185
Who'd now be...
-15. I get it.

35:31.220 --> 35:32.825
Sally gave that kid back.

35:32.860 --> 35:35.399
Because she wasn't crazy.
She knew she had the wrong kid.

35:35.860 --> 35:39.345
The hospital ran DNA tests.
Child Services ran more tests.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.145
There wasn't a mistake.
-Sure.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.505
But what if Sally thought there was?

35:43.540 --> 35:45.100
We need to find out
if Noah there is adopted.

35:49.517 --> 35:51.042
Where have you been?

35:51.110 --> 35:53.261
Why haven't you been
answering your calls?

35:56.140 --> 35:57.780
Baby.
-I'm sorry.

35:58.980 --> 36:01.380
Cal, what happened?
-I'm such an idiot.

36:03.140 --> 36:04.785
You said we needed money

36:04.820 --> 36:06.460
so I went and got
gear off Billie to sell.

36:07.268 --> 36:09.313
But right after, I got mugged.

36:09.397 --> 36:10.397
Billie?

36:11.533 --> 36:12.884
How'd you get the money?

36:21.700 --> 36:24.300
I'm so sorry. I'll...
I'll make back the money.

36:25.300 --> 36:26.785
You went and bought gear off Billie

36:26.820 --> 36:29.445
and right after, you got mugged.

36:29.860 --> 36:32.060
You know, that would have
been one of his guys, right?

36:33.980 --> 36:35.385
I thought I was being smart.

36:35.420 --> 36:38.225
I gotta go see Billie.
-No way.

36:38.260 --> 36:39.970
The guy's a psycho.

36:40.006 --> 36:42.126
No, I'm not letting you.

36:43.706 --> 36:45.997
We've got the camera back from the lab.

36:51.620 --> 36:54.996
Evidence of Sally's
blood. No-one else's.

37:05.220 --> 37:07.012
That's taken from the tree.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.785
Can you zoom in?

37:10.820 --> 37:12.380
It's Noah.

37:20.558 --> 37:21.984
Another.

37:38.660 --> 37:40.985
So, this is where Sally took the photos.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.620
And where she died.

37:45.660 --> 37:48.180
But the knife was found here.

37:49.340 --> 37:52.540
It had been firmly stuck in her ribs.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.100
But this is where it got pulled out.

37:58.220 --> 38:00.545
You think it was still in
her on the other side?

38:00.580 --> 38:03.761
Yes. 'Cause that's
where she got stabbed.

38:06.420 --> 38:10.060
So, Cassandra Dalton and her
son lived here four years ago.

38:12.220 --> 38:15.540
And Sally knew Noah was
here. She'd photographed him.

38:18.126 --> 38:19.682
I think she came for him.

38:21.740 --> 38:24.148
How long ago do you think
these were polished?

38:25.020 --> 38:26.394
A few years ago.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.420
Watch your step.

38:31.718 --> 38:33.598
There's a lot of junk down here.

38:36.220 --> 38:37.660
See anything?
-No.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.700
Wait.

38:45.060 --> 38:46.538
Blood.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.340
It was self-defence.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.825
She was crazy.

38:51.860 --> 38:53.545
She wanted Noah.

38:53.580 --> 38:56.865
She came to take him,
and Noah is not her child.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.425
The hospital proved it.

38:58.460 --> 39:00.305
Please, you don't have to
say anything right now.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.705
I don't care. I didn't know she died.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.220
I didn't know she was in the tree.

39:05.580 --> 39:09.420
I was just protecting
my boy, not hers. Mine.

39:10.940 --> 39:12.840
What would you do to protect your child?

39:12.876 --> 39:14.420
What would you do?

39:39.020 --> 39:41.131
Do you think I had
your boyfriend rolled?

39:41.167 --> 39:42.830
I know you did.

39:43.748 --> 39:45.385
You're smarter than him.

39:45.847 --> 39:47.492
So what are you gonna do about it?

39:47.590 --> 39:49.230
It's what you're gonna do.

39:50.558 --> 39:54.443
You're gonna spot me
$1,000 worth of ecc.

39:54.860 --> 40:00.220
I'm gonna sell it, then I'm
going to give you $1,500,

40:01.054 --> 40:02.865
and then we don't need to speak again.

40:07.630 --> 40:09.195
Lift up your shirt.

40:10.002 --> 40:11.345
What?

40:11.380 --> 40:13.465
Lift it. Right up.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.105
Turn around.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.240
I wanna see if you're clean.

40:35.174 --> 40:36.419
Doesn't look like e.

40:36.455 --> 40:38.427
Yeah, it's something better, apparently.

40:38.510 --> 40:40.515
Haven't had a chance to move 'em yet.

40:40.765 --> 40:42.085
So you can.

40:44.742 --> 40:47.462
1,500. One week.

40:49.660 --> 40:53.503
I want a home. I want a job.
I want my family.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.780
No-one will give me a chance.
No-one will believe me.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.196
Most people...
-Hi.

41:00.445 --> 41:01.850
What's so important?

41:02.020 --> 41:03.825
Sally's DNA results are in.

41:03.860 --> 41:05.756
I thought you tested that days ago.

41:05.792 --> 41:07.637
We tested her bones.

41:07.820 --> 41:10.585
Once I learnt that Sally
had ovarian cancer,

41:10.620 --> 41:13.425
I sent Simon to the Oncology
Department of Prince Edward's

41:13.460 --> 41:16.025
where she was diagnosed.

41:16.060 --> 41:20.145
The Oncology Department took
biopsy samples of her ovarian tissue

41:20.180 --> 41:22.225
as part of her diagnosis.

41:22.260 --> 41:23.980
They still had those samples.

41:25.500 --> 41:29.528
Here is Sally's DNA
from her bone sample.

41:30.460 --> 41:36.620
And here is the DNA sample
from her ovarian tissue.

41:37.701 --> 41:39.314
They're different.

41:39.677 --> 41:41.002
Is that a mistake?

41:41.300 --> 41:42.745
No mistake.

41:43.351 --> 41:45.991
Sally had two sets of DNA.

41:47.433 --> 41:49.278
She was a chimera.

41:49.780 --> 41:51.425
She should have been born a twin,

41:51.460 --> 41:55.444
but in utero, she absorbed
the DNA of that twin,

41:55.940 --> 41:59.580
and that different DNA
resided only in her ovarian tissue.

42:00.660 --> 42:03.425
Her body contained one set of DNA,

42:03.460 --> 42:07.700
but her ovarian cells contained
the DNA of her dead twin.

42:08.629 --> 42:11.194
And that was the DNA
that was passed on to Noah.

42:11.460 --> 42:15.225
So, when the hospital tested
this homeless woman's DNA

42:15.260 --> 42:18.655
against that of an infant
born outside the hospital system,

42:18.691 --> 42:20.216
they were different.

42:20.620 --> 42:22.630
So they took him away.

42:23.020 --> 42:25.385
So, Noah is her son.

42:25.420 --> 42:27.100
Yeah.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.700
And no-one believed her.

43:11.780 --> 43:13.705
I'm not supposed to talk to anyone.

43:13.740 --> 43:16.534
But you want to, though, don't you?

43:18.185 --> 43:19.961
It was you, wasn't it?

43:20.940 --> 43:24.705
You snuck into old man
Connelly's house, took his knife,

43:24.740 --> 43:27.985
an army knife, a grown-up knife,

43:28.020 --> 43:30.481
and you played with it
because that's what boys do.

43:31.533 --> 43:33.036
Then there was that woman.

43:34.500 --> 43:37.305
You'd seen her before, hadn't you?

43:37.340 --> 43:38.426
Lots.

43:38.461 --> 43:40.105
Hey. Let go of him.

43:40.140 --> 43:42.265
Ever since I was little.

43:42.300 --> 43:43.860
No. No.

43:45.140 --> 43:46.665
She was scary.

43:48.256 --> 43:50.965
Then one day you were at home...

43:51.860 --> 43:53.620
..she came for you.

43:56.580 --> 43:58.820
But you had Connelly's knife.

44:04.500 --> 44:06.900
I was just trying to protect us.

44:25.900 --> 44:29.335
We didn't know how badly I
hurt her or where she went.

44:41.900 --> 44:43.660
She was my real mum, wasn't she?

44:51.280 --> 44:53.800
What do I do now? Will I go to jail?

44:54.700 --> 44:56.580
I don't know.

44:57.940 --> 45:01.505
But I do know that your mum
will go to jail for a very long time,

45:01.540 --> 45:05.461
and I know that she'll do
so happily to protect you.

45:08.260 --> 45:09.977
It's up to you.

45:52.660 --> 45:54.140
It's her boy.

46:48.361 --> 46:50.001
He's confessed.

46:50.503 --> 46:52.188
The Dalton boy.

46:52.247 --> 46:53.247
Noah.

46:54.702 --> 46:56.387
You overstepped.

46:56.740 --> 46:59.545
You're encouraging Dass to overstep.

46:59.580 --> 47:01.620
We don't need another Harrow.

47:02.294 --> 47:04.134
You ready?
-Hi.

47:08.941 --> 47:13.061
Good work, but you're developing
a backlog, so clear it up.

47:17.460 --> 47:19.700
Like walking in on your
parents having sex.

47:21.160 --> 47:23.720
Only worse.
-So much worse.

47:31.400 --> 47:32.605
Hi.

47:32.740 --> 47:34.985
Hi. Guess what I've got?

47:35.020 --> 47:37.115
High hopes of winning Eurovision.

47:37.500 --> 47:42.985
Yeah, but also, Kiriakos approved
me a little coffle of slaves.

47:43.757 --> 47:46.531
I'm going to find this orthopaedic
surgeon before you do.

47:48.300 --> 47:49.943
You wanna put money on it?

47:51.500 --> 47:55.145
You should have tried for the bet
before you told me about the slaves.

47:55.180 --> 47:57.305
It's a gentleman's wager.

47:57.340 --> 47:59.109
You got it.

48:06.300 --> 48:07.705
Yes, thank you Doctor, yes I do.

48:07.740 --> 48:11.225
It's 3-5-5-B-

48:13.500 --> 48:14.860
B for Bravo.

48:18.960 --> 48:21.240
OK. Thank you, Doctor.

48:49.100 --> 48:51.985
You got Anthony's name from Jack Twine?

48:52.020 --> 48:54.105
Yes, Jack was my old boss.

48:54.140 --> 48:57.569
He was a good friend for Anthony
when he got into trouble.

48:58.830 --> 49:00.721
Are you in trouble too?

49:02.093 --> 49:03.667
The police are coming.

49:03.703 --> 49:05.188
More trouble?

49:05.303 --> 49:08.185
I suppose if you're here
from the morgue, there is.

49:08.220 --> 49:10.060
I don't think I can handle...
-Listen.

49:11.260 --> 49:14.620
It's up to you, but I know
what they're looking for...

49:15.620 --> 49:18.665
..and it doesn't have to
be here when they arrive.

49:18.700 --> 49:21.705
Now, you don't know
what they're looking for,

49:21.740 --> 49:25.493
and you can honestly say that
you've not touched the files.

50:16.220 --> 50:18.220
This is what we're looking for.

51:02.326 --> 51:04.091
Next on Harrow...

51:04.127 --> 51:06.532
I think that those bones
might have been in the river

51:06.568 --> 51:07.945
for less than a year.

51:07.981 --> 51:09.745
I've put in a request
to have them destroyed.

51:09.780 --> 51:10.826
Get Simon to get rid of them.

51:10.861 --> 51:14.025
It's the first time I think
we've ever failed.

51:14.060 --> 51:15.825
Three young people heading to emergency

51:15.860 --> 51:17.945
suffering the exact same symptoms,

51:17.980 --> 51:21.220
high heart rate, dehydration,
mild hallucinations.

51:22.220 --> 51:23.945
The seller was a young woman.

51:23.980 --> 51:26.985
I know you love her, mate,
but don't play me for a fool.

51:27.020 --> 51:28.977
I'm OK.

51:29.540 --> 51:30.937
I'll get you out of here.
