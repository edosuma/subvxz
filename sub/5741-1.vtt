01:00.676 --> 01:02.477
<i>It痴 hormonal.</i>

01:02.478 --> 01:05.579
I mean, I don't usually
fall back on, you know,

01:05.580 --> 01:07.582
Women's issues, but...

01:07.583 --> 01:10.451
But child-proofed how?
Gates and stuff?

01:10.452 --> 01:12.454
Dude, she did the drawers.

01:12.455 --> 01:15.023
We don't even know if this whole
fertility thing is going to work.

01:15.024 --> 01:17.425
She screwed in these little jobbies
where you can't even open the drawers.

01:17.426 --> 01:20.261
- At all?
- No. They open, you know, like an inch.

01:20.262 --> 01:22.365
Then you gotta dig your finger in.
I mean, it's a nightmare.

01:22.366 --> 01:24.032
I guess sooner or later...

01:24.033 --> 01:26.634
Yeah, well, a lot later.
She did the upper cabinets.

01:26.635 --> 01:28.602
The kid'll be 30
before he can reach 'em,

01:28.603 --> 01:30.571
Assuming, you know,
we have a kid.

01:30.572 --> 01:31.474
<i>Attention...</i>

01:31.475 --> 01:34.476
It is natural for her
to feel protective.

01:34.477 --> 01:37.045
Don't even...
You have women's issues.

01:37.046 --> 01:39.381
Please.
You of all people.

01:39.382 --> 01:41.415
Oh, come on, it's a jinx.

01:41.416 --> 01:45.186
It... It guarantees that
we won't get pregnant.

01:45.187 --> 01:47.756
And it takes me about 20
minutes to get a fuckin' beer.

01:47.757 --> 01:50.625
Guys, guys,
Stockholm went south.

01:50.626 --> 01:53.595
Seriously? I thought
they were looking good.

01:53.596 --> 01:55.230
What cracked?

01:55.231 --> 01:57.664
I haven't seen the footage.
Word is just going around.

01:57.665 --> 01:59.635
Well, it's never been
a stable scenario.

01:59.636 --> 02:02.103
Everyone knows
you can't trust Swedes.

02:02.104 --> 02:04.506
That means there's just
Japan... Japan and us.

02:04.507 --> 02:06.641
It's not the first time
it's come down to that.

02:06.642 --> 02:10.244
- Japan has a perfect record.
- We're #2. We try harder.

02:10.245 --> 02:13.314
- Guys, if we fail...
- Please, we haven't had a glitch since '98.

02:13.315 --> 02:15.083
We know what we're doing, Lin.

02:15.084 --> 02:17.118
Or we have it written down...
somewhere.

02:17.119 --> 02:19.220
You guys better not
be messing around in there.

02:19.221 --> 02:21.457
Ooh, does this mean you're not
in the betting pool this year?

02:21.458 --> 02:23.158
Big money.

02:23.159 --> 02:25.326
I am just saying
it's a key scenario.

02:25.327 --> 02:27.061
No, I hear what you're saying.

02:27.062 --> 02:30.131
In '98, it was the Chem
Department's fault, right?

02:30.132 --> 02:34.171
Where do you work again? Wait,
it's coming back to me now.

02:35.171 --> 02:36.472
It's gonna be a long weekend

02:36.473 --> 02:38.572
if everyone's that puckered up.

02:38.573 --> 02:41.142
So you wanna come over Monday night?

02:41.143 --> 02:44.580
I'm gonna pick up some power
drills, liberate my cabinets.

02:45.580 --> 02:47.320
Are you even listening to me?

03:06.568 --> 03:11.673
<i># You never get that taste
out of your mouth #</i>

03:11.674 --> 03:15.243
<i># You never get the paw print
out of the hen house now #</i>

03:15.244 --> 03:19.814
<i># And you can't go back
the same way you came #</i>

03:19.815 --> 03:21.882
<i># Round all the pieces up #</i>

03:21.883 --> 03:23.585
<i># But they just don't
fit the same #</i>

03:23.586 --> 03:27.892
<i># Right now 'cause
maybe it's not so bad #</i>

03:29.892 --> 03:32.527
<i># So let your hair
down now... #</i>

03:32.528 --> 03:35.463
Ugh! Professor Fuckwad.

03:35.464 --> 03:38.232
Why haven't you stuck that asshole's
picture on the dartboard yet?

03:38.233 --> 03:41.335
It's not that simple.
Oh, my god.

03:41.336 --> 03:43.671
- Your hair... It's blond.
- Very fabulous, no?

03:43.672 --> 03:46.907
- I can't believe you did it.
- But very fabulous, right?

03:46.908 --> 03:48.642
Hurry up with
the "very fabulous".

03:48.643 --> 03:50.344
I'm getting insecure
about it now.

03:50.345 --> 03:51.913
Oh, god. No, no.
It looks awesome.

03:51.914 --> 03:55.149
- Curt's gonna lose it.
- Oh, Curt痴 gonna thank me.

03:55.150 --> 03:57.886
And so will you while we
are burning this picture.

03:57.887 --> 03:59.453
Oh, not ready.

03:59.454 --> 04:02.756
Seriously,
this isn't his fault.

04:02.757 --> 04:04.893
What's not his fault?

04:04.894 --> 04:07.828
Fucking his student or
breaking up with her by email?

04:07.829 --> 04:10.899
<i>- I knew what I was getting into.
- Oh, please.</i>

04:10.900 --> 04:11.936
You know what you're
getting into this weekend?

04:13.936 --> 04:15.703
This.

04:15.704 --> 04:18.473
And if Holden痴 as cute
as Curt says he is,

04:18.474 --> 04:19.940
Possibly getting out of it.

04:19.942 --> 04:22.409
That is the last thing
that I want.

04:22.410 --> 04:24.746
If you guys treat this like a set-up,
I知 gonna have no fun at all.

04:24.747 --> 04:28.552
I'm not pushing.
But we're packing this.

04:29.552 --> 04:32.286
Which means we definitely
won't have room for...

04:32.287 --> 04:33.921
What if I get bored?

04:33.922 --> 04:35.723
These'll help?

04:35.724 --> 04:38.226
"Soviet economic structures"?

04:38.227 --> 04:41.596
"Aftermath of the ca... "
No.

04:41.597 --> 04:44.632
<i>We have a lake and a cake.
No more learning!</i>

04:44.633 --> 04:46.901
Think fast.
Ooh, faster than that.

04:48.470 --> 04:51.738
Sorry, sorry.
Move along.

04:51.739 --> 04:53.675
- Nice!
- Is that Holden?

04:53.676 --> 04:54.870
<i>We'll be right down!</i>

04:54.876 --> 04:56.578
<i>He just transferred from state.</i>

04:56.579 --> 04:59.546
Best hands on the team.
He's a sweet guy.

04:59.547 --> 05:01.450
<i>- And he's good with his hands.
- Hey!</i>

05:01.451 --> 05:03.317
I'm kind of seeing this girl,

05:03.318 --> 05:05.687
But you're way blonder
than she is.

05:05.688 --> 05:08.255
But I was thinking,
you know, maybe...

05:08.256 --> 05:09.957
What is this?

05:09.958 --> 05:11.758
What are these?
What are you doing with these?

05:11.759 --> 05:13.360
Okay, I get it.
I'll leave the books.

05:13.361 --> 05:15.730
No, no. Who gave you these?
Who taught you about these?

05:15.731 --> 05:19.933
I learned it from you, okay?
I learned it from watching you!

05:19.934 --> 05:22.736
Okay, seriously,
professor Bennett...

05:22.737 --> 05:25.974
He covers this whole book
in his lectures.

05:25.975 --> 05:28.976
You should read this.

05:28.977 --> 05:31.745
Gurovsky. Now, this is
way more interesting.

05:31.746 --> 05:34.015
Also, Bennett
doesn't know it by heart,

05:34.016 --> 05:36.450
So he'll think
you're insightful.

05:36.451 --> 05:37.952
And you have no pants.

05:37.953 --> 05:40.994
Oh, shit!

05:44.994 --> 05:47.594
<i>- That pretty much it?
- Fuckin' better be.</i>

05:47.595 --> 05:50.331
You know, Jules, it's a
weekend, not an evacuation.

05:50.332 --> 05:52.933
Trust me when I say there
is nothing in those cases

05:52.934 --> 05:55.435
you won't be glad I brought.

05:55.436 --> 05:57.008
I'm shutting right up.

06:00.008 --> 06:00.876
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

06:01.876 --> 06:04.846
<i># In the backseat
screaming out loud #</i>

06:04.847 --> 06:06.614
<i># In the backseat
screaming out... #</i>

06:06.615 --> 06:08.619
Marty.

06:10.619 --> 06:12.792
What the fuck is wrong
with you, bro?

06:16.792 --> 06:20.628
People in this town drive in a
very counterintuitive manner.

06:20.629 --> 06:22.897
That's what I have to say.

06:22.898 --> 06:24.932
Do you want to spend
the weekend in jail?

06:24.933 --> 06:27.033
'Cause we'd all like to check
out my cousin's country home.

06:27.034 --> 06:27.871
Marty, honey, that's not okay.

06:28.871 --> 06:29.873
Statistical fact...

06:30.873 --> 06:34.608
Cops will never pull over a man
with a huge bong in his car.

06:34.609 --> 06:36.978
Why?
They fear this man.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.447
They know he sees
farther than they,

06:39.448 --> 06:44.554
And he will bind them
with ancient logics.

06:45.554 --> 06:46.887
Have you gone gray?

06:46.888 --> 06:49.490
You're not bringing
that thing in the rambler.

06:49.491 --> 06:54.594
What? A giant bong
in your father's van?

06:54.595 --> 06:56.701
What are you, stoned?

06:58.701 --> 07:00.935
Hey, man.

07:00.936 --> 07:04.772
Dana, you fetching minx!

07:04.773 --> 07:06.774
Do you have any food?

07:06.775 --> 07:07.876
<i>Everybody ready?</i>

07:08.876 --> 07:10.911
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

07:10.912 --> 07:13.014
- Yeah?
- Okay, I知 ready.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.515
Let's get this show
on the road.

07:14.516 --> 07:15.882
Fuck, yeah!

07:15.883 --> 07:21.022
<i># The static comes in slow #</i>

07:21.023 --> 07:25.125
<i># You can feel it grow #</i>

07:25.126 --> 07:29.535
<i># Our stream of conscience
flows... #</i>

07:33.535 --> 07:37.674
The nest is empty.
We're right on time.

07:38.674 --> 07:39.876
<i>I hope this
is the right road.</i>

07:40.876 --> 07:42.944
It doesn't even show up
on the G. P. S.

07:42.945 --> 07:44.945
It is unworthy
of global positioning.

07:44.946 --> 07:47.081
<i>That's the whole point...</i>

07:47.082 --> 07:48.950
Get off the grid, right?

07:48.951 --> 07:51.084
No cell phone reception,

07:51.085 --> 07:53.620
<i>No traffic cameras.</i>

07:53.621 --> 07:55.923
Go someplace
for one goddamn weekend

07:55.924 --> 07:59.560
where they can't globally
position my ass, man.

07:59.561 --> 08:01.829
You can...
This is the whole issue.

08:01.830 --> 08:03.498
Is society crumbling, Marty?

08:03.499 --> 08:05.933
No, society is binding.

08:05.934 --> 08:09.803
Right? It's filling in
the cracks with concrete.

08:09.804 --> 08:14.541
Everything's filed
or recorded or blogged, right?

08:14.542 --> 08:17.911
Chips in our kids' heads
so they won't get lost?

08:17.912 --> 08:19.913
<i>Society needs to crumble.</i>

08:19.914 --> 08:22.649
We're all just too
chicken shit to let it.

08:22.650 --> 08:24.551
I've missed your rants.

08:24.552 --> 08:28.589
You will come
to see things my way.

08:33.061 --> 08:37.097
<i>- Identification, please.
- Security team 6...</i>

08:37.099 --> 08:39.633
Mr. Sitterson.

08:39.634 --> 08:41.602
Mr. Hadley.
Thank you.

08:41.602 --> 08:43.938
- What's your name?
- Daniel Truman, sir.

08:43.938 --> 08:46.773
This isn't the military, Truman.
You can drop the "sir".

08:46.774 --> 08:50.011
But Sitterson does like
to be called ma'am.

08:50.012 --> 08:52.579
- Or honey toes.
- He will also answer to honey toes.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.614
You clear on what's
going to be happening here?

08:54.615 --> 08:55.949
I've been prepped extensively.

08:55.950 --> 08:57.184
And did they tell you
that being prepped

08:57.185 --> 08:59.086
- is not the same thing as being prepared?
- They told me.

08:59.087 --> 09:02.723
- I'll hold my post, Mr. Hadley.
- Good man.

09:02.724 --> 09:05.959
<i>Okay, system's online.</i>

09:05.960 --> 09:10.620
Acquiring target.
Let's see what we got.

09:32.620 --> 09:33.999
All right.

09:44.999 --> 09:48.902
I'm thinking this thing
doesn't take credit cards.

09:48.903 --> 09:51.906
I don't think
it knows about money.

09:51.907 --> 09:53.995
I think it's barter gas.

10:13.995 --> 10:16.606
Hello?

10:25.606 --> 10:28.542
<i>Say, Holden.</i>

10:28.543 --> 10:29.944
<i>Holden!</i>

10:29.945 --> 10:31.079
I don't think
there's gonna be any...

10:31.080 --> 10:32.780
You come here uninvited?

10:32.781 --> 10:34.115
<i>Fuck!</i>

10:34.116 --> 10:35.287
Dude.

10:39.287 --> 10:41.122
Sign says "closed".

10:41.123 --> 10:42.960
We were looking
to buy some gas.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.960
Does this pump work?

10:45.961 --> 10:47.962
If you know how to work it.

10:47.963 --> 10:50.931
We also wanted
to get directions.

10:50.932 --> 10:54.569
- Yeah, we're looking for... What's it called?
- Tillerman road.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.840
Do you know if it's this way?

10:58.840 --> 11:00.877
Tillerman road takes you
up the hill there,

11:01.877 --> 11:04.979
Dead ends
at the old Buckner place.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.679
My cousin bought
a house up there.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.051
You go through, like, a mountain
tunnel; there's a lake.

11:09.052 --> 11:11.051
<i>- Would that be the...
- Buckner place.</i>

11:11.052 --> 11:15.055
Always someone looking
to sell that plot.

11:15.056 --> 11:16.757
You knew the original owners?

11:16.758 --> 11:17.859
Yeah, not the first.

11:18.859 --> 11:21.929
I seen plenty come and go.

11:21.930 --> 11:24.898
- Hell, I been here since the war.
- Which war?

11:24.899 --> 11:26.600
You know damn well which war.

11:26.601 --> 11:30.070
Would that have been
with the blue

11:30.071 --> 11:32.640
and some in gray,

11:32.641 --> 11:36.009
Brother perhaps fighting
against brother in that war?

11:36.010 --> 11:37.911
You sassin' me, boy?

11:37.912 --> 11:40.046
You were rude to my friend.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.882
That whore?

11:41.883 --> 11:43.383
What'd you say?

11:43.384 --> 11:45.386
I think we got enough gas.

11:45.387 --> 11:47.054
You got enough
to get you there.

11:47.055 --> 11:51.404
Getting back...
That's your concern.

12:03.404 --> 12:06.272
Well, good luck
with your business, sir.

12:06.273 --> 12:09.676
I know the railroad's coming
through here any day now.

12:09.677 --> 12:10.979
<i>That's gonna be big.</i>

12:10.980 --> 12:13.850
Streets paved
with actual street.

12:14.850 --> 12:16.754
Fucker.

12:53.754 --> 12:56.806
Guys, take a look.

13:32.460 --> 13:35.075
<i>This must be it.</i>

13:47.075 --> 13:51.177
Oh, my god,
it's, uh, beautiful.

13:51.178 --> 13:54.415
One spider and I知
sleeping in the rambler.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.217
I mean it.

13:56.218 --> 13:58.831
Come on, give me a hand.

14:54.276 --> 14:56.810
Ho ho!
This is awesome.

14:56.811 --> 14:58.311
It is kinda cool.

14:58.312 --> 15:00.848
Hey, you gonna kill us
a raccoon to eat?

15:00.849 --> 15:03.152
I'll use its skin
to make a cap.

15:04.152 --> 15:06.320
<i>Everybody get your suits on.</i>

15:06.321 --> 15:08.955
<i>- In 10 minutes, we're hitting the lake.
- Yeah.</i>

15:08.956 --> 15:11.976
<i>I was not informed
there would be calisthenics.</i>

15:28.976 --> 15:32.590
Yeah, I don't think so.

15:41.590 --> 15:43.627
Whoa.

15:45.627 --> 15:48.449
No way.

16:07.449 --> 16:09.921
Nah... Ah, shit.

16:12.921 --> 16:16.190
Um, this is happening.

16:16.191 --> 16:17.165
<i>Uh...</i>

16:24.165 --> 16:25.936
Hold up!

16:27.936 --> 16:31.537
<i>You've got to
be fucking kidding me.</i>

16:31.538 --> 16:33.107
That's just creepy.

16:33.108 --> 16:35.342
It was pioneer days.

16:35.343 --> 16:38.344
People had to make
their own interrogation rooms.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.347
Who did your cousin
buy this place from?

16:40.348 --> 16:42.683
We should check the rest of the rooms
and make sure this is the only one.

16:42.684 --> 16:45.652
'Cause you know Marty wants
to watch us pounding away.

16:45.653 --> 16:48.055
I didn't even like
hearing that.

16:48.056 --> 16:50.528
<i>Don't be an ape, Curt.</i>

16:53.528 --> 16:56.195
How about we switch?

16:56.196 --> 16:58.299
Not that I壇... I mean,
I壇 put the picture back,

16:58.300 --> 17:01.301
But you might feel better
if we switched rooms.

17:01.302 --> 17:03.373
I really would.

17:04.973 --> 17:08.375
Thanks for, uh, being decent.

17:08.376 --> 17:10.377
It's the least I could do

17:10.377 --> 17:12.512
since Curt and Jules
sold you to me for marriage.

17:12.513 --> 17:14.982
Um, they're not subtle.

17:14.983 --> 17:17.550
Well, I値l just be flattered
and keep it to myself.

17:17.551 --> 17:21.320
Yeah, I知 not looking for...
But I知 still grateful

17:21.321 --> 17:22.723
that you're not a creep.

17:22.723 --> 17:24.657
Let's not jump
to any conclusions there.

17:24.659 --> 17:27.660
I had kind of an internal debate
about showing you the mirror...

17:27.661 --> 17:30.397
Shouting on both sides,
blood was spilled.

17:30.398 --> 17:32.398
So you're bleeding internally.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.666
Pretty bad.

17:33.667 --> 17:38.442
Well, Jules is pre-Med. You
should probably talk to her.

17:40.442 --> 17:42.350
Uh, o-okay.

18:09.370 --> 18:11.312
<i>Whoa.</i>

18:18.312 --> 18:20.091
Oh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

18:31.091 --> 18:33.407
Yeah, I don't think so.

18:46.407 --> 18:48.408
<i>Yeah...</i>

18:48.409 --> 18:51.211
<i>Very clean, Curt...</i>

18:54.648 --> 18:57.216
You gonna get the rest?

18:57.217 --> 18:59.086
Are you gonna help?

18:59.087 --> 19:01.487
<i>I gotta say,
I like my room.</i>

19:01.488 --> 19:04.191
Places, everyone.

19:04.192 --> 19:05.591
We are live.

19:05.592 --> 19:07.328
Engineering, we've got
a room change...

19:07.329 --> 19:10.364
Polk is now in 2,
McCrea is in 4.

19:10.365 --> 19:13.466
<i>Operations, do you copy?
We need a scenario adjustment.</i>

19:13.467 --> 19:17.170
<i>- I値l have it back to you in 15.
- Miss Lin.</i>

19:17.171 --> 19:19.572
We've got the blood work
back on Louden.

19:19.573 --> 19:22.176
Her levels are good,
but we're recommending

19:22.177 --> 19:25.178
a 50mg bump of Rhohyptase
to increase libido.

19:25.179 --> 19:27.781
- Sold.
- Do we pipe it in or do you want to do it orally?

19:27.782 --> 19:30.416
Oh, ask me that again,
only slower.

19:30.417 --> 19:34.420
You're a pig. Guess how we're
slowing down cognition.

19:34.421 --> 19:35.524
I don't know.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.592
- The hair dye.
- Dumb blonde.

19:39.593 --> 19:42.529
- Very artistic.
- Works its way into the blood

19:42.530 --> 19:45.465
through the scalp...
Very gradual.

19:45.466 --> 19:48.268
The Chem Department
keeps their end up.

19:48.269 --> 19:49.702
I'll see it when I believe it.

19:49.703 --> 19:51.473
<i>- Control?
- Yeah, go ahead.</i>

19:51.474 --> 19:53.674
<i>Uh, I have the harbinger
on line 2.</i>

19:53.675 --> 19:57.477
Oh, Christ.
Can you take a message?

19:57.478 --> 19:59.312
<i>Uh, I don't think so.</i>

19:59.313 --> 20:01.748
<i>He's really pushy.</i>

20:01.749 --> 20:04.751
<i>Um, to be honest,
he's kind of freaking me out.</i>

20:04.752 --> 20:07.354
Okay, put him on.

20:07.355 --> 20:09.289
Mordecai, baby,
what's happening?

20:09.290 --> 20:10.225
How's the weather up top?

20:10.226 --> 20:12.893
The lambs have passed
through the gate.

20:12.894 --> 20:14.795
They are come
to the killing floor.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.797
<i>Well, you're doing
a great job out there.</i>

20:16.798 --> 20:20.166
By the numbers, man. You got
us started off just right.

20:20.167 --> 20:21.902
So we'll talk
to you later, okay?

20:21.903 --> 20:25.672
Their blind eyes see nothing
of the horrors to come.

20:25.673 --> 20:27.441
Their ears are stopped.

20:27.442 --> 20:29.542
<i>They are the gods' fools.</i>

20:29.543 --> 20:33.280
Well, that's how it works.

20:33.281 --> 20:35.415
<i>Cleanse them.
Cleanse the world</i>

20:35.416 --> 20:37.451
<i>of their ignorance and sin.</i>

20:37.452 --> 20:39.919
<i>Bathe them in the crimson of...</i>

20:39.920 --> 20:41.257
<i>Am I on speakerphone?</i>

20:43.257 --> 20:44.891
No, absolutely not.

20:44.892 --> 20:46.461
<i>Speakerphone? No.
No, I wouldn't do that.</i>

20:46.462 --> 20:49.428
<i>Yes, I am.
I can hear the echo.</i>

20:49.429 --> 20:51.231
Oh, my god.
You're right.

20:51.232 --> 20:53.167
Hang on one second.
I'll take you off.

20:53.168 --> 20:56.235
<i>That's rude. I don't
know who's in the room.</i>

20:56.236 --> 20:58.605
Fine, there...
You're off.

20:58.606 --> 21:00.174
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:00.175 --> 21:02.408
<i>Don't take this lightly, boy.</i>

21:02.409 --> 21:04.477
<i>It wasn't all by your numbers.</i>

21:04.478 --> 21:09.550
<i>The fool nearly derailed the
invocation with his insolence.</i>

21:09.551 --> 21:12.452
<i>The ancient ones
see everything.</i>

21:12.453 --> 21:14.388
<i>And they will not be...</i>

21:14.389 --> 21:16.423
<i>I'm still on speakerphone,
aren't i?</i>

21:17.958 --> 21:21.494
Oh, my god, Mordecai!

21:21.495 --> 21:23.530
I can't believe it.
It did it again.

21:23.531 --> 21:25.566
Mordy?

21:25.567 --> 21:27.501
What happens next?

21:27.502 --> 21:29.903
Whoo!

21:29.904 --> 21:31.775
Ah!

21:34.775 --> 21:36.909
Oh, that's cold!

21:36.910 --> 21:39.346
Whoo, that's what
cold feels like!

21:39.347 --> 21:41.315
Yeah, how cold?
Is it worth it?

21:41.316 --> 21:43.916
Come on, Jules.
Life is risk.

21:43.917 --> 21:46.986
Yeah, I might just risk laying
out in the sun for a while.

21:46.987 --> 21:48.422
Boo.

21:48.423 --> 21:50.523
- Hey, what is that?
- What?

21:50.524 --> 21:52.693
- In the lake right there.
- Oh, come on.

21:52.694 --> 21:54.329
Guys, I知 serious,
right there. There, there!

21:54.330 --> 21:56.495
God, it looks just
like my girlfriend.

21:58.565 --> 22:00.500
Oh, my god!

22:00.501 --> 22:04.237
There's something else
in the lake.

22:04.238 --> 22:07.006
- It's a gorgeous man!
- I'm gonna kill you!

22:07.007 --> 22:09.542
Don't kill the gorgeous man.
We're endangered.

22:15.882 --> 22:19.418
All right, last chance.
It's post time.

22:19.419 --> 22:21.922
Dig deep, people.
Betting windows are closing.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.624
Okay, who's still out?

22:23.625 --> 22:27.261
Uh, let's see... We've got
Engineering, we've got R&D,

22:27.262 --> 22:29.395
- And we've got Electrical.
- Did you see who they picked?

22:29.396 --> 22:31.366
They're practically
giving their money away.

22:31.367 --> 22:33.433
You should talk, Aquaman.

22:33.434 --> 22:35.769
- What do you mean?
- Aw, nothing.

22:35.770 --> 22:37.537
Okay, all right.

22:37.538 --> 22:39.572
I'm not even sure
we have one of these.

22:39.573 --> 22:41.375
Zoology swears we do.

22:41.376 --> 22:44.477
Well, they'd know.
Okay, all right, people.

22:44.478 --> 22:46.413
Hey, what do you got?

22:46.414 --> 22:47.947
No, they've already
been picked.

22:47.948 --> 22:49.448
What? No.
Who took them?

22:49.449 --> 22:51.484
- Maintenance.
- Maintenance?

22:51.485 --> 22:53.452
- They pick the same thing every year.
- What do you want from me?

22:53.453 --> 22:55.521
If they were creative, they
wouldn't be in maintenance.

22:55.522 --> 22:57.658
Now, you're gonna have to split this if you win.
You wanna switch?

22:57.659 --> 23:00.926
Um, I don't know.
I don't know.

23:00.927 --> 23:02.795
What do you think?

23:02.796 --> 23:05.436
More than anything I just
want this moment to end.

23:09.436 --> 23:11.038
Not betting?

23:11.039 --> 23:13.339
Not for me.
Thanks.

23:13.340 --> 23:16.510
Seems a little harsh,
doesn't it?

23:16.511 --> 23:19.479
It's just people
letting off steam.

23:19.480 --> 23:23.783
This job isn't easy, however
those clowns may behave.

23:23.784 --> 23:27.320
Does the director... Do they
know about this downstairs?

23:27.321 --> 23:28.753
The director doesn't
care about this stuff,

23:28.754 --> 23:30.655
As long as everything
goes smoothly upstairs,

23:30.656 --> 23:32.592
As long as the kids do
as they are told...

23:32.593 --> 23:34.394
But then it's fixed.

23:34.395 --> 23:35.896
No, no, no.

23:35.897 --> 23:38.764
How can you wager on this
when you control the outcome?

23:38.765 --> 23:41.667
No, we just get them in the cellar.
They take it from there.

23:41.668 --> 23:44.004
No, they have to make the
choice of their own free will.

23:44.005 --> 23:46.439
<i>Otherwise the system
doesn't work.</i>

23:46.440 --> 23:47.941
Just like the harbinger.

23:47.942 --> 23:49.909
He's this creepy old fuck,

23:49.910 --> 23:52.412
Practically wears a sign.
"You will die. "

23:52.413 --> 23:54.781
Why do we put him there?
The system.

23:54.782 --> 23:56.782
They have to choose
to ignore him,

23:56.783 --> 23:58.619
<i>And they have to choose
what happens in the cellar.</i>

23:58.620 --> 24:01.088
Yeah, we rig the game
as much as we need to,

24:01.089 --> 24:03.724
But in the end,
they don't transgress...

24:03.725 --> 24:05.591
They can't be punished.

24:05.592 --> 24:07.462
So what's it going to be,
Truman? You in?

24:07.463 --> 24:08.863
Window's closing.

24:09.863 --> 24:12.836
I'm fine.

24:14.836 --> 24:17.137
Okay, that's it, gang.

24:17.138 --> 24:18.571
The board is locked!

24:18.572 --> 24:20.974
Oh, let's get
this party started.

24:20.975 --> 24:23.444
<i>Let's get this party started!</i>

24:33.454 --> 24:36.490
Okay, who wants some beer?
Here you go.

24:36.491 --> 24:39.393
Okay, my turn.
Jules?

24:39.394 --> 24:40.463
Mmm?

24:42.463 --> 24:43.763
Truth or dare?

24:43.764 --> 24:46.899
<i>- Let's go dare.
- All right.</i>

24:46.900 --> 24:50.102
I dare you to make out with...

24:50.103 --> 24:52.139
Please say Dana. Please say Dana.
Please say Dana.

24:52.140 --> 24:54.511
...that moose over there.

24:56.511 --> 24:59.082
Marty, have you ever
seen a moose before?

25:02.082 --> 25:04.518
Whatever that
mysterious beast is.

25:04.519 --> 25:06.986
- That's a wolf.
- That's clearly a wolf.

25:06.987 --> 25:09.990
I'm living in a womb of reefer.
Leave me alone.

25:09.991 --> 25:13.996
Jules, I dare you
to make out with that wolf.

25:15.996 --> 25:17.023
No problem.

25:42.023 --> 25:45.492
Who? Me?

25:45.493 --> 25:48.628
<i>Why, yes, I am new in town.</i>

25:48.629 --> 25:50.698
How did you know?

25:51.698 --> 25:54.533
Oh, my god, that is
so sweet of you to say.

25:54.534 --> 25:55.936
I just colored it, in fact.

25:55.937 --> 26:00.941
<i>No, no, no, there's no need
to huff and puff.</i>

26:00.942 --> 26:03.196
I'll let you come in.

26:22.196 --> 26:23.811
Oh.

26:36.811 --> 26:38.813
Thank you.

26:45.919 --> 26:48.224
<i>Yeah, baby!</i>

26:50.224 --> 26:55.160
- Now then, Dana?
- Truth.

26:55.161 --> 26:57.731
What's that supposed to mean?

26:57.732 --> 26:59.633
I'm just skipping ahead.

26:59.634 --> 27:01.134
You're gonna say "dare".

27:01.135 --> 27:03.271
She's gonna dare you to do
something you don't like.

27:03.272 --> 27:07.541
And then you'll puss out and say
that you wanted truth all along.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.645
Really?

27:10.645 --> 27:14.281
Okay, Jules, dare.

27:14.282 --> 27:16.950
What the hell was that?

27:16.951 --> 27:18.951
<i>It's the cellar door.</i>

27:19.853 --> 27:21.321
The wind must have
blown it open.

27:21.322 --> 27:24.791
<i>Uh, that makes
what kind of sense?</i>

27:24.792 --> 27:27.298
What do you think
is down there?

27:30.298 --> 27:32.302
Why don't we find out?

27:34.302 --> 27:35.801
Dana...

27:35.802 --> 27:38.955
I dare you.

27:54.955 --> 27:57.624
How long do I have to
stay down here?

27:57.625 --> 28:00.160
<i>Oh, you know,
just till morning.</i>

28:34.160 --> 28:37.262
<i>- Ah!
- Dana?</i>

28:37.263 --> 28:39.099
You okay?

28:39.100 --> 28:40.736
Yeah.

28:42.736 --> 28:45.070
Sorry, I just scared myself.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.807
Well, you called for help.
That voids the dare.

28:47.808 --> 28:49.809
Take your top off.

28:49.810 --> 28:51.948
<i>What? I didn't
make up the rules.</i>

28:54.948 --> 28:56.852
Oh, my god.

28:58.852 --> 29:00.857
<i>Look at all this.</i>

29:02.857 --> 29:05.759
Uh, guys...

29:05.760 --> 29:11.431
I'm not sure it's awesome
to be down here.

29:11.432 --> 29:14.367
<i>- Guys?
- Dude, seriously,</i>

29:14.368 --> 29:18.370
Your cousin is
into some weird shit.

29:18.371 --> 29:21.941
Yeah, well, I知 pretty sure
this ain't his.

29:21.942 --> 29:25.416
Maybe it was the people
who put in that mirror thing.

29:28.416 --> 29:30.783
Some of this stuff
looks really old.

29:30.784 --> 29:33.157
It's beautiful.

29:36.157 --> 29:39.363
<i>Maybe we should
go back upstairs.</i>

29:43.363 --> 29:46.387
I dare you all to go upstairs.

30:40.321 --> 30:41.857
Guys?

30:42.857 --> 30:45.191
<i>Guys, listen to this.</i>

30:45.192 --> 30:47.159
"April 4th.

30:47.160 --> 30:51.764
Father was cross with me and
said I lacked the true faith.

30:51.765 --> 30:54.000
I wish I could prove
my devotion

30:54.001 --> 30:56.970
as Judah and Matthew proved
on those travelers. "

30:56.971 --> 30:58.305
What is that?

30:59.305 --> 31:02.308
Diary of Anna Patience Buckner,

31:02.309 --> 31:04.377
1903.

31:04.378 --> 31:06.881
"Mama screamed
most of the night.

31:07.881 --> 31:10.116
I prayed that
she might find faith,

31:10.117 --> 31:12.785
But she only stopped
when papa cut her belly

31:12.786 --> 31:15.288
and stuffed the coals in.

31:15.289 --> 31:17.859
Judah told me in my dream
that Matthew took him

31:18.859 --> 31:21.895
to the black room,
so I know he is killed.

31:21.896 --> 31:25.497
I want to understand
the glory of the pain

31:25.498 --> 31:26.965
like Matthew,

31:26.966 --> 31:27.869
But cutting the flesh

31:28.869 --> 31:32.371
makes him have
a husband's bulge

31:32.372 --> 31:34.907
<i>and I do not get like that. "</i>

31:34.908 --> 31:37.243
- Jesus, can we not...
- No, go on.

31:37.244 --> 31:39.078
<i>- Why?
- I want to know.</i>

31:39.079 --> 31:41.079
"I have found it...

31:41.080 --> 31:45.417
In the oldest books,
the way of saving our family.

31:45.418 --> 31:48.521
My good arm
is hacked up and 'et'

31:48.522 --> 31:51.390
so I hope
this will be readable.

31:51.391 --> 31:53.025
<i>But a believer will come</i>

31:53.026 --> 31:55.328
<i>and speak this to our spirits.</i>

31:55.329 --> 31:59.234
Then we will be restored and
the great pain will return. "

32:01.234 --> 32:03.936
And then... Then there's
something in Latin.

32:03.937 --> 32:07.406
Okay, I知 drawing a line
in the fucking sand here.

32:07.407 --> 32:09.008
Do not read the Latin.

32:09.009 --> 32:11.410
<i>Read it.</i>

32:11.411 --> 32:14.446
<i>- What the fuck?
- Read it out loud.</i>

32:14.447 --> 32:16.114
<i>No, no, no.</i>

32:16.115 --> 32:17.584
Stop being a fucking baby.

32:17.585 --> 32:19.385
<i>- Curt.
- It's a diary.</i>

32:19.386 --> 32:21.486
It doesn't even mean anything.

32:21.487 --> 32:24.996
Dana.

33:05.398 --> 33:07.199
<i>We have a winner!</i>

33:07.200 --> 33:09.168
It's the Buckners,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:09.169 --> 33:11.670
The Buckners pull a "W".

33:11.671 --> 33:15.641
All right, that means
that congratulations

33:15.642 --> 33:17.377
go to Maintenance...

33:19.346 --> 33:21.481
...who share the pot
with Ronald the intern.

33:21.482 --> 33:25.083
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Wait, that's not fair. I had zombies, too.

33:25.084 --> 33:27.021
Yes, you did.
Yes, you had zombies.

33:27.022 --> 33:30.089
But this is "zombie redneck
torture family". See?

33:30.090 --> 33:32.090
They're entirely
separate species.

33:32.091 --> 33:34.694
It's like the difference between
an elephant and an elephant seal.

33:34.695 --> 33:38.397
There's always next year.

33:38.398 --> 33:41.333
<i>They're like
something from a nightmare.</i>

33:41.334 --> 33:45.504
No, they're something
nightmares are from.

33:45.505 --> 33:49.442
Everything in our stable
is remnant of the old world,

33:49.443 --> 33:53.111
Courtesy of you know who.

33:53.112 --> 33:57.015
Monsters? Magic? Gods?

33:57.016 --> 33:59.085
You get used to it.

33:59.086 --> 34:01.498
Should you?

34:11.498 --> 34:13.031
Oh, man, I知 sorry.

34:13.032 --> 34:14.435
- He had the conch in his hands.
- I know.

34:14.436 --> 34:16.101
You know,
a couple more minutes,

34:16.103 --> 34:18.005
Who knows what
might have happened?

34:18.005 --> 34:20.505
I am never gonna
see a merman, ever.

34:20.507 --> 34:23.641
Dude, be thankful.
Those things are terrifying.

34:23.643 --> 34:26.281
And the clean-up on 'em
is a nightmare.

34:28.281 --> 34:29.748
So the Buckners again.

34:29.750 --> 34:32.385
Well, they may be zombified,

34:32.386 --> 34:34.387
pain-worshipping
backwoods idiots.

34:34.388 --> 34:38.322
But they're <i>our</i> zombified,
pain-worshipping backwoods idiots.

34:38.324 --> 34:40.592
- With 100% clearance rate.
- True.

34:40.594 --> 34:42.594
So should we call Japan?

34:42.596 --> 34:44.397
Tell them to take
the rest of the weekend off?

34:44.398 --> 34:46.099
Yeah, right.
They're Japanese.

34:46.100 --> 34:47.299
What are they gonna do, relax?

34:47.300 --> 34:49.668
I'd just like to see them
fall on their asses for once.

34:49.668 --> 34:51.402
<i>God, don't even joke.</i>

34:51.402 --> 34:52.772
<i>Every other branch
has air-Balled.</i>

34:52.773 --> 34:55.274
<i>We need the Japanese crew
to get it done.</i>

34:55.275 --> 34:57.477
<i>There's too much
riding on this.</i>

35:17.797 --> 35:21.636
<i># Can't get you
out of my head #</i>

35:22.636 --> 35:27.272
<i># Thinking about you
while I知 lying in bed #</i>

35:27.273 --> 35:31.243
<i># Your fingertips are craving,
got me misbehaving #</i>

35:31.244 --> 35:36.515
<i># And all I want to do
is scream your name out #</i>

35:36.516 --> 35:38.785
<i># I want your desire... #</i>

35:38.786 --> 35:41.421
Fuck, yeah, baby.

35:41.422 --> 35:43.122
This is so classy.

35:43.123 --> 35:45.323
Come on, like you wouldn't
want a piece of that.

35:45.324 --> 35:48.528
Can we not talk about people
and pieces anymore tonight?

35:48.529 --> 35:52.668
Oh, are you
feeling lonely, Marty?

35:55.668 --> 35:58.537
Marty and I were sweeties
in our freshman hall.

35:58.538 --> 36:01.506
We made out once.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.843
I never did buy that ring.

36:03.844 --> 36:07.546
But we're still...

36:07.547 --> 36:09.821
Close.

36:13.821 --> 36:16.189
I have a theory about all this.

36:16.190 --> 36:18.557
That's our cue to bail.

36:18.558 --> 36:21.126
Tommy Chong here has a theory.

36:21.127 --> 36:23.162
Come on, baby.

36:23.163 --> 36:25.298
Don't worry, you can
tell it to egghead here

36:25.299 --> 36:28.533
if he's not too busy
devirginizing Dana.

36:28.534 --> 36:29.871
Jules, do you want
to go lie down?

36:30.871 --> 36:33.472
That's exactly the point.
Come on.

36:33.473 --> 36:35.508
- Mush, mush!
- Don't push me around.

36:35.509 --> 36:37.384
Not around, baby.
It's a straight line.

36:58.632 --> 37:02.434
You seriously believe
nothing weird is going on?

37:02.435 --> 37:05.204
Conspiracy?

37:05.205 --> 37:07.439
The way everybody is acting.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.542
<i>Why is Jules suddenly
a celebutard?</i>

37:10.543 --> 37:14.847
And since when does Curt
pull this alpha-male bullshit?

37:14.848 --> 37:18.151
I mean, he's a sociology major.

37:18.152 --> 37:20.285
He's on full
academic scholarship

37:20.286 --> 37:23.256
and now he's calling
his friend an egghead?

37:23.257 --> 37:24.890
Curt's just drunk.

37:24.891 --> 37:28.260
I've seen Curt drunk.

37:28.261 --> 37:30.196
Jules, too.

37:30.197 --> 37:32.430
Well, then, maybe
it's something else.

37:32.431 --> 37:35.200
What?

37:35.201 --> 37:37.505
You're not seeing what
you don't want to see.

37:39.505 --> 37:41.406
Puppeteers.

37:41.407 --> 37:42.407
Puppeteers?

37:42.875 --> 37:44.609
Pop-Tarts?

37:44.610 --> 37:46.546
Did you say
you have pop-Tarts?

37:46.547 --> 37:50.487
Marty, I love you,
but you're really high.

37:53.487 --> 37:55.259
We are not who we are.

37:59.259 --> 38:02.794
I'm gonna go read
a book with pictures.

38:02.795 --> 38:06.531
Thank you.
"The pain outlives the flesh.

38:06.532 --> 38:10.803
The flesh returns or re...
Has a meeting place. "

38:10.804 --> 38:12.504
What is that?

38:12.505 --> 38:14.307
The Latin that you read...

38:14.308 --> 38:16.341
You speak Latin?

38:16.342 --> 38:20.412
Not well.
Not since 10th grade.

38:20.413 --> 38:22.448
Weird how it all comes back.

38:22.449 --> 38:26.218
Well, it's a weird
kind of night.

38:26.219 --> 38:29.622
I'm sorry about tonight.
Everybody...

38:29.623 --> 38:33.493
Do I lose points if I tell you
I知 having a pretty nice time?

38:34.493 --> 38:36.829
No.

38:36.830 --> 38:38.933
You can tell me that.

38:44.471 --> 38:47.574
What are you running away for?

38:51.344 --> 38:53.312
Ah!

38:53.313 --> 38:54.914
Don't spill on me.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.685
Oh, did I get a little
beer on your shirt?

38:58.685 --> 39:00.489
I guess it'll have to
come off, huh?

39:03.489 --> 39:07.492
- Not here.
- Oh, baby, come on.

39:07.493 --> 39:09.605
We're all alone.

39:19.605 --> 39:21.807
I'm chilly.

39:21.808 --> 39:24.376
Okay, guys, that's it.

39:24.377 --> 39:26.044
Let's go.
We've got a job to do.

39:26.045 --> 39:29.048
Your basic human needs disgust me.
Get out of here.

39:29.049 --> 39:30.717
Do we have temperature
control in this sector?

39:30.718 --> 39:32.389
On it.

39:36.389 --> 39:38.985
Engaging pheromone mists.

40:04.985 --> 40:08.553
It's so dark.
Take me inside.

40:08.554 --> 40:11.793
Baby, come on,
this is why we came here.

40:12.793 --> 40:14.380
It's romantic.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.048
Okay, baby,
let's see some boobies.

40:36.049 --> 40:38.418
Show us the goods.

40:39.418 --> 40:41.454
Does it really matter
if we see...

40:41.455 --> 40:42.987
We're not the only ones
watching, kid.

40:42.988 --> 40:44.860
Gotta keep
the customer satisfied.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.563
You understand
what's at stake here?

41:01.875 --> 41:04.438
Oh.

41:32.438 --> 41:34.777
Score.

42:06.206 --> 42:08.177
Jules!

42:10.177 --> 42:12.711
Fuck.

42:12.712 --> 42:14.583
- Curt!
- Ah!

42:21.054 --> 42:22.734
Oh, fuck.

42:34.734 --> 42:37.068
Curt!

43:03.230 --> 43:06.634
No. No.

43:08.634 --> 43:11.507
What are you... What are
you gonna do to me?

43:13.507 --> 43:16.516
- No!
- Curt!

43:23.516 --> 43:26.251
This we offer
in humility and fear

43:26.252 --> 43:30.588
for the blessed peace
of your eternal slumber.

43:30.589 --> 43:33.576
- As it ever was.
- As it ever was.

44:23.576 --> 44:25.743
Nemo, man, you gotta wake up.

44:25.744 --> 44:27.917
Your shit is topsy-turvy.

44:30.917 --> 44:33.651
<i>I知 gonna go for a walk.</i>

44:33.652 --> 44:36.895
Okay, I swear to fucking god
somebody is talking.

44:41.895 --> 44:45.097
Or I知 pretty sure
someone is. Oh.

44:45.098 --> 44:48.100
<i>I知 gonna go for a walk.</i>

44:48.101 --> 44:50.169
Enough!

44:50.170 --> 44:52.171
What are you saying, huh?

44:52.172 --> 44:54.610
What do you want?

44:56.610 --> 44:58.309
You think I知 a puppet, huh?

44:58.310 --> 44:59.812
You think I知 a puppet,

44:59.813 --> 45:03.983
Gonna do a little
fuckin' puppet dance?

45:03.984 --> 45:05.857
I'm the boss of my own
brain, so give it up.

45:10.857 --> 45:13.369
I'm gonna go for a walk.

45:23.369 --> 45:26.942
I don't want to...
I mean, I致e never...

45:28.942 --> 45:30.642
I don't mean "never".

45:30.643 --> 45:33.650
Hey, nothing you don't want.

45:37.650 --> 45:40.385
He's got a husband bulge.

45:57.404 --> 46:00.444
I thought there'd be stars.

46:04.444 --> 46:07.420
We are abandoned.

46:33.005 --> 46:35.140
- Ah!
- Fuckin' run!

46:35.141 --> 46:37.341
- Whoa!
- Curt!

46:37.342 --> 46:38.850
Dead bitch.

46:43.850 --> 46:45.718
Jesus!
What the fuck?

46:45.719 --> 46:47.185
Curt, what the fuck?

46:47.186 --> 46:49.787
- Where are you hurt? Is all of this from you?
- Hold on, hold on!

46:49.788 --> 46:51.789
- Where's...
- Curt, you're okay.

46:51.790 --> 46:54.462
Where's Jules?

46:56.462 --> 46:58.431
She's gone.

46:59.431 --> 47:02.434
We gotta get out of here.

47:02.435 --> 47:04.202
No! No, wait.

47:04.203 --> 47:06.738
- Dana, don't open that.
- I'm not leaving here without Jules.

47:06.739 --> 47:08.241
<i>That dead girl's out there!</i>

47:30.964 --> 47:32.904
Dana, come on!

47:37.904 --> 47:39.972
- What is that thing?
- Fuck.

47:39.973 --> 47:42.273
- I don't know, but there's more of them.
- More of them?

47:42.274 --> 47:44.777
<i>I saw a young girl,</i>

47:44.778 --> 47:46.445
<i>All zombied like him.</i>

47:46.446 --> 47:47.913
But she was missing an arm.

47:47.914 --> 47:50.048
Oh, my god.

47:50.049 --> 47:51.517
Patience.

47:51.518 --> 47:53.452
The diary.

47:53.453 --> 47:56.421
- Look, we gotta lock this place down.
- He's right.

47:56.422 --> 47:59.323
We'll go room by room, barricade
every window and door.

47:59.324 --> 48:01.059
We gotta play it safe.

48:01.060 --> 48:03.230
No matter what happens,
we have to stay together.

48:05.230 --> 48:07.365
- Fuck!
- Calm down.

48:07.366 --> 48:09.004
Watch the master work.

48:20.045 --> 48:22.183
- This isn't right.
- What? What's the matter?

48:24.183 --> 48:27.118
Th... This isn't right.
We should split up.

48:27.119 --> 48:30.155
We can cover
more ground that way.

48:30.156 --> 48:32.524
Yeah.

48:32.525 --> 48:35.493
Yeah, good idea.

48:35.494 --> 48:37.130
Really?

48:38.130 --> 48:40.136
Guys... You guys,
get in your rooms.

48:44.136 --> 48:46.340
Lock 'em in.

48:50.509 --> 48:54.979
Huh? What...
What the fuck?

48:54.980 --> 48:57.548
<i>Ah!</i>

48:57.549 --> 49:00.352
Shit. Oh.

49:06.458 --> 49:08.235
What the...

49:16.235 --> 49:19.037
What the fuck?

49:19.038 --> 49:20.338
Uh-Oh, that's not good.

49:20.339 --> 49:22.441
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Out of the way.

49:22.442 --> 49:26.445
Chem Department, I need 500 ccs
of Thorazine pumped into room 3.

49:26.446 --> 49:30.015
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Stand by, chem.

49:30.016 --> 49:32.487
<i>Judah Buckner to the rescue.</i>

49:34.487 --> 49:37.558
What the fuck?

49:38.558 --> 49:41.898
<i>What the fuck?
What the fuck?!</i>

49:45.898 --> 49:48.966
Oh, my god.

49:48.967 --> 49:53.338
I'm on a reality TV show.

49:55.475 --> 49:59.044
My parents are gonna think
I知 such a burnout.

49:59.045 --> 50:01.113
Ah! Fuck!

50:01.114 --> 50:03.386
Ah! Help!

50:07.386 --> 50:08.172
Ah!

50:34.980 --> 50:36.647
No, no!

50:45.491 --> 50:50.400
Help me! Help me!

51:16.255 --> 51:18.423
Must be getting excited
downstairs.

51:18.424 --> 51:20.527
Greatest show on earth.

51:37.677 --> 51:39.714
Somebody help me!

51:41.714 --> 51:43.556
Come on!

51:51.556 --> 51:55.797
- Ah! Move the bed.
- Come on, come on.

51:57.797 --> 52:00.808
<i>Holden.</i>

52:09.808 --> 52:12.714
- It's empty.
- Go.

52:14.714 --> 52:16.381
- Curt?
- Unlock the door.

52:16.382 --> 52:18.788
<i>I can't.
Get down to the basement.</i>

52:35.802 --> 52:38.102
This is the black room.

52:38.103 --> 52:40.275
Nice.

52:42.275 --> 52:44.578
From the diary.

52:45.578 --> 52:48.848
<i>This is where he killed them.</i>

52:49.848 --> 52:52.551
This is where he kills us.

52:52.552 --> 52:56.555
Oh, hey, no.
He's not gonna kill us.

52:56.556 --> 52:58.490
We just gotta find a door.

52:58.491 --> 53:00.462
<i>Okay?</i>

53:03.462 --> 53:05.729
Let's just check
the walls, okay?

53:05.730 --> 53:08.332
Curt?

53:08.333 --> 53:10.267
I mean, there's got
to be some...

53:15.708 --> 53:18.380
Ah! No!

53:25.817 --> 53:28.357
You like pain?

53:31.357 --> 53:33.842
How's that work for you?

53:55.815 --> 53:58.517
Oh, these fucking zombies.

53:58.518 --> 54:00.719
<i>Remember when you could just
throw a girl in a volcano?</i>

54:00.720 --> 54:02.821
How old do you think I am?

54:11.397 --> 54:13.710
Let's move! Come on!
Come on, let's go!

54:25.710 --> 54:27.412
What about Marty?

54:27.413 --> 54:29.458
They got him.

55:18.496 --> 55:20.231
Fuck you!

55:20.232 --> 55:22.367
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,

55:22.368 --> 55:24.469
<i>Fuck you, fuck you.</i>

55:26.906 --> 55:28.974
- You seeing this?
- Perfect record, huh?

55:28.975 --> 55:29.875
The Japan crew should have
had this in the bag.

55:30.875 --> 55:33.311
They fucked us. How hard is
it to kill nine-year-olds?

55:33.312 --> 55:35.680
Zero fatality, total wash.

55:35.681 --> 55:37.717
<i>I知 telling you,
you want good product,</i>

55:37.718 --> 55:39.417
<i>You gotta buy American.</i>

55:39.418 --> 55:41.419
Any word from downstairs?

55:41.420 --> 55:42.822
Downstairs doesn't
care about Japan.

55:42.823 --> 55:45.990
- The director trusts us.
- Hey, you just sweat the Chem, Lin.

55:45.991 --> 55:49.493
While these morons are singing
"what a friend we have in Shinto,"

55:49.494 --> 55:50.852
we are bringing the pain.

55:50.862 --> 55:53.365
Yeah, and what the fuck's up
with this guy's pot anyway?

55:53.366 --> 55:54.465
<i>Now he's supposed
to be drooling,</i>

55:54.466 --> 55:55.833
<i>And instead he almost makes us?</i>

55:55.834 --> 55:57.601
<i>We treated the
shit out of it.</i>

55:57.602 --> 55:59.772
Okay, we got the rambler
heading toward the tunnel.

55:59.773 --> 56:02.039
<i>The fool's toast anyway.</i>

56:02.040 --> 56:05.542
<i>And so are we if you don't
get this under control.</i>

56:05.543 --> 56:07.579
- Shit.
- What? "Shit" why?

56:07.580 --> 56:09.547
<i>- Gotta go. Work to do.
- You guys are humanity's last hope.</i>

56:09.548 --> 56:11.582
If the ancients rise, we...

56:11.583 --> 56:13.451
<i>- There's no cave-In.
- What?</i>

56:13.452 --> 56:16.620
The fucking tunnel's open!

56:16.621 --> 56:19.056
<i>- Control to demolition.
- We're dark in the whole sector.</i>

56:19.057 --> 56:21.027
- Try to bypass it.
- What the fuck do you think I知 doing?

56:21.028 --> 56:22.337
Okay, open the door.

56:31.337 --> 56:33.338
Look out.
Get out of the...

56:33.339 --> 56:35.645
Make a hole.

56:39.645 --> 56:41.311
- What the fuck's going on?
- We don't know.

56:41.312 --> 56:42.612
Electrical said
there was a glitch...

56:42.613 --> 56:44.480
That tunnel should have
blown hours ago.

56:44.481 --> 56:46.755
- Well, we didn't get the order.
- Come on, come on.

56:49.755 --> 56:52.596
Right there.

56:58.596 --> 57:01.466
Hadley, what is going on?

57:01.467 --> 57:02.934
Hadley!

57:02.935 --> 57:05.040
Why hasn't the tunnel blown?

57:54.754 --> 58:00.425
No. No, no, no.
No fucking way!

58:00.426 --> 58:04.662
I can't believe this, man.
This ain't happening.

58:04.663 --> 58:07.432
It's right there.

58:07.433 --> 58:09.633
All right, we got any
climbing gear, ropes?

58:09.634 --> 58:12.470
Yeah, in my fucking dorm room.

58:12.471 --> 58:15.106
We can't go back.
There's no way across?

58:15.107 --> 58:17.508
What are we gonna do, jump?

58:17.509 --> 58:19.545
Dude.

58:20.545 --> 58:22.446
What?

58:27.619 --> 58:29.120
Curt, are you sure about this?

58:29.121 --> 58:30.622
I've done bigger jumps
than this.

58:30.623 --> 58:32.122
<i>You've got a smooth run</i>

58:32.123 --> 58:34.592
and maybe a five-foot
differential on the other side.

58:34.593 --> 58:36.727
But you've got
to give it everything.

58:36.728 --> 58:38.000
Curt...

58:41.000 --> 58:43.535
Look, you guys,
you stay in the rambler.

58:43.536 --> 58:45.003
<i>I'll get help.</i>

58:45.004 --> 58:48.106
If I wipe out,
I値l fucking limp for help.

58:48.107 --> 58:50.475
But I知 coming back here.

58:50.476 --> 58:53.577
I'm coming back
with cops and choppers

58:53.578 --> 58:55.046
and large fuckin' guns.

58:55.047 --> 58:57.115
And those things
are gonna pay...

58:57.116 --> 59:00.527
For Jules.

59:09.527 --> 59:12.030
Don't hold back.

59:12.031 --> 59:14.656
I never do.

59:38.656 --> 59:40.124
No!

59:40.125 --> 59:42.227
Curt!

59:42.228 --> 59:45.997
<i>No! Oh, god!</i>

59:45.998 --> 59:47.701
Oh, my god.

59:52.605 --> 59:54.272
He hit something.
There's nothing.

59:54.273 --> 59:56.610
What did he hit?

59:57.610 --> 59:59.846
Puppeteers.

01:00:01.846 --> 01:00:03.515
Marty was right.

01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:05.552
Get in the van.

01:00:07.552 --> 01:00:09.025
Dana.

01:00:14.025 --> 01:00:16.098
Marty was right.

01:00:35.047 --> 01:00:36.647
You're going back.

01:00:36.648 --> 01:00:38.316
I'm going through.

01:00:38.317 --> 01:00:40.051
We'll just drive.

01:00:40.052 --> 01:00:42.154
There's got to be another road,
another way out of here.

01:00:42.155 --> 01:00:44.588
That won't work.

01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:48.660
Something'll happen.
It'll collapse, wash away.

01:00:48.661 --> 01:00:51.662
Then we just leave
the roads altogether,

01:00:51.663 --> 01:00:53.331
Drive as far as we can
into the forest

01:00:53.332 --> 01:00:55.603
<i>and we go on foot from there.</i>

01:00:57.603 --> 01:00:59.604
You're missing the point.

01:00:59.605 --> 01:01:02.240
Please do not go nuts
on me, okay, Dana?

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:03.947
You're all I致e got now.

01:01:07.947 --> 01:01:09.646
I'm okay.

01:01:09.647 --> 01:01:11.783
<i>Good, okay,
'cause I need you calm.</i>

01:01:11.784 --> 01:01:15.654
Okay, no matter what happens,
we've got to stick...

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:14.412
God damn, that was close!

01:02:14.413 --> 01:02:16.414
Yeah, photo fuckin' finish.

01:02:16.415 --> 01:02:19.283
I don't understand.
You're celebrating?

01:02:19.284 --> 01:02:22.220
They're celebrating.
I'm drinking.

01:02:22.221 --> 01:02:25.423
But she's still alive. How
can the ritual be complete?

01:02:25.424 --> 01:02:27.860
The virgin's death is optional
as long as it's last.

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.361
The main thing is that
she, you know, suffers.

01:02:31.362 --> 01:02:33.799
That she did.

01:02:34.799 --> 01:02:37.367
It's so strange.

01:02:37.368 --> 01:02:40.138
I'm actually rooting
for this girl.

01:02:40.139 --> 01:02:42.707
<i>She's got so much heart.</i>

01:02:42.708 --> 01:02:46.376
<i>You think of all the pain and the...</i>

01:02:46.377 --> 01:02:50.247
# Tequila is my lady!
My lady! #

01:02:50.248 --> 01:02:52.249
Come on in, guys.
Come on in, come on in.

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.285
You're welcome.
Tequila!

01:02:54.286 --> 01:02:56.261
From darkness there is light.

01:03:30.989 --> 01:03:32.397
Ah!

01:03:40.364 --> 01:03:43.301
<i># As soon as you are able #</i>

01:03:43.302 --> 01:03:46.336
<i># Woman, I am willin' #</i>

01:03:46.337 --> 01:03:50.807
<i># To make the break
that we are on the brink of #</i>

01:03:50.808 --> 01:03:53.376
<i># My cup is on the table #</i>

01:03:53.377 --> 01:03:56.914
<i># My love is spillin' #</i>

01:03:56.915 --> 01:04:01.788
<i># Waiting here for you
to take and drink of... #</i>

01:04:02.788 --> 01:04:05.823
I wish that I could do
what you do.

01:04:05.824 --> 01:04:08.158
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah, it's masterful.

01:04:08.159 --> 01:04:11.461
Oh, I don't know. You know,
tonight was solid. I don't know.

01:04:11.462 --> 01:04:13.295
Are you kidding?
Classic denouement.

01:04:13.296 --> 01:04:15.065
- When the van hits the lake...
- I screamed.

01:04:15.066 --> 01:04:16.935
- Right?
- And the water rushing in and the zombie...

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.435
<i>Primal terror.</i>

01:04:18.436 --> 01:04:21.439
I just think it would've
been cooler with a merman.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.875
Do you know if we get the
overtime bonus on this one?

01:04:23.875 --> 01:04:25.910
Accounting's over there.
Ask them.

01:04:25.911 --> 01:04:27.311
I don't need to.
I already know the answer.

01:04:27.312 --> 01:04:29.350
I'm an intern.

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.318
So I don't qualify for O. T.

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:36.121
It's funny that
you like the ballet,

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:38.488
Because I happen
to have two tickets

01:04:38.489 --> 01:04:42.325
to your favorite...

01:04:42.326 --> 01:04:44.461
You knuckleheads.

01:04:44.462 --> 01:04:46.831
You almost gave me a heart
attack with that tunnel.

01:04:46.832 --> 01:04:49.466
Like I said, it wasn't our fault.
We didn't get the order.

01:04:49.467 --> 01:04:52.135
I'm just giving you
a hard time.

01:04:52.136 --> 01:04:54.437
come on.
Give us a hug.

01:04:54.438 --> 01:04:57.441
- Hey.
- No, seriously, that wasn't our fault.

01:04:57.442 --> 01:05:01.345
<i>There was a glitch... A
power reroute from upstairs.</i>

01:05:01.346 --> 01:05:04.115
What do you mean, upstairs?

01:05:15.427 --> 01:05:17.928
Turn the fucking music off.

01:05:31.409 --> 01:05:34.412
Hello?

01:05:34.413 --> 01:05:36.914
That's impossible. Everything
was done within the guidelines.

01:05:36.915 --> 01:05:39.118
<i>The virgin's the only one.</i>

01:05:40.118 --> 01:05:42.389
No, I am not doubting you.

01:05:45.389 --> 01:05:47.098
Which one?

01:06:27.665 --> 01:06:30.605
- Marty?
- Hi.

01:06:33.605 --> 01:06:35.476
Dana!

01:06:37.476 --> 01:06:39.498
Dana, come on.

01:07:00.498 --> 01:07:03.133
Oh!

01:07:03.134 --> 01:07:06.273
Marty, wait,
we're going in the grave?

01:07:09.273 --> 01:07:11.489
Dana, come on!

01:07:26.657 --> 01:07:28.359
What is this place?

01:07:29.694 --> 01:07:31.429
<i>Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, okay.</i>

01:07:33.364 --> 01:07:38.105
Yeah, I had to dismember
that guy with a trowel.

01:07:40.105 --> 01:07:41.511
What have you been up to?

01:07:46.511 --> 01:07:49.382
Nobody else, huh?

01:07:50.382 --> 01:07:52.119
Yeah.

01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:57.488
Yeah, I figured.

01:07:57.489 --> 01:08:00.091
You figured everything.

01:08:00.092 --> 01:08:02.459
No, not at all.

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.363
But I do know some stuff.

01:08:05.364 --> 01:08:07.536
As in...

01:08:12.536 --> 01:08:14.338
<i>It's an elevator.</i>

01:08:14.339 --> 01:08:18.441
Somebody sent those dead
fucks up here to get us.

01:08:18.442 --> 01:08:21.444
Now, there's
no controls inside,

01:08:21.444 --> 01:08:24.046
But there's maintenance
overrides in there.

01:08:24.048 --> 01:08:27.584
And I think I can
get it to go down.

01:08:27.585 --> 01:08:30.788
Do we want to go down?

01:08:31.788 --> 01:08:34.497
Where else are we gonna go?

01:08:39.497 --> 01:08:41.500
Here.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.337
Okay, okay, okay.

01:08:47.337 --> 01:08:50.544
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:08:52.544 --> 01:08:54.211
Ah! Come on!

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:56.446
Fucking zombie arm!

01:09:13.432 --> 01:09:16.334
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:09:54.371 --> 01:09:56.280
Shit.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.116
Oh, my god.

01:10:05.116 --> 01:10:07.392
What the...

01:11:06.578 --> 01:11:08.913
We chose.

01:11:08.914 --> 01:11:11.515
What? What?

01:11:11.516 --> 01:11:13.551
What? Oh.

01:11:13.552 --> 01:11:15.192
Fuck.

01:11:21.192 --> 01:11:22.762
In the cellar.

01:11:23.762 --> 01:11:26.462
All that shit
we were playing with.

01:11:26.463 --> 01:11:28.535
They made us choose.

01:11:30.535 --> 01:11:33.444
They made us choose how we die.

01:12:11.308 --> 01:12:12.710
We saw them go down
the access drop.

01:12:12.711 --> 01:12:14.410
They have to be
in one of these.

01:12:14.411 --> 01:12:15.679
Internal security could...

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.983
I don't care if it's not protocol.
Are you fucking high?

01:12:18.984 --> 01:12:21.318
It's the fool.
Do not touch the girl.

01:12:21.319 --> 01:12:23.420
If he outlives her,
this whole thing goes to hell.

01:12:23.421 --> 01:12:24.954
<i>Take him out first.</i>

01:12:24.955 --> 01:12:27.557
Clean-up says the prep team
missed one of the kid's stashes.

01:12:27.558 --> 01:12:30.427
Whatever he's been smoking has been
immunizing him to all our shit.

01:12:30.428 --> 01:12:31.852
How does that help us
right now? What?

01:12:31.862 --> 01:12:34.931
No, if you have a confirmed
kill, take her out, too.

01:12:34.932 --> 01:12:38.504
- There!
- 3606.

01:12:39.504 --> 01:12:41.887
<i>- Gotcha.
- Bring 'em down.</i>

01:12:59.456 --> 01:13:02.626
Out of the elevator! Step out of the elevator!

01:13:02.627 --> 01:13:05.361
- Why are you trying to kill us?
- Step out.

01:13:05.362 --> 01:13:07.698
- Just the girl.
- Just me?

01:13:07.699 --> 01:13:09.365
Do it!

01:13:09.366 --> 01:13:10.801
No!

01:13:10.802 --> 01:13:12.311
Ah!

01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:21.370
Good work, zombie arm.

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:50.007
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

01:13:50.008 --> 01:13:51.877
<i>This should have
gone differently,</i>

01:13:52.877 --> 01:13:55.578
<i>Ended more quickly.</i>

01:13:55.579 --> 01:13:59.083
<i>I can only imagine
your pain and confusion.</i>

01:13:59.084 --> 01:14:00.950
<i>But know this.</i>

01:14:00.951 --> 01:14:04.887
<i>What's happening to you
is part of something bigger,</i>

01:14:04.888 --> 01:14:08.361
<i>Something older
than anything known.</i>

01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:11.427
<i>You've seen horrible things,</i>

01:14:11.428 --> 01:14:14.498
<i>An army of nightmare creatures.</i>

01:14:14.499 --> 01:14:18.468
<i>But they are nothing
compared to what came before,</i>

01:14:18.469 --> 01:14:20.039
<i>What lies below.</i>

01:14:22.039 --> 01:14:26.075
<i>It's our task to placate
the ancient ones,</i>

01:14:26.076 --> 01:14:29.480
<i>As it's yours
to be offered up to them.</i>

01:14:31.415 --> 01:14:34.985
<i>Forgive us and let us
get it over with.</i>

01:14:34.986 --> 01:14:38.459
Go on.
Go, go, go, go.

01:14:59.878 --> 01:15:02.554
Army of nightmares, huh?

01:15:10.554 --> 01:15:13.524
<i>Let's get this party started.</i>

01:15:13.525 --> 01:15:16.627
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

01:15:29.574 --> 01:15:31.141
Oh, shit.

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:48.525
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

01:15:54.932 --> 01:15:57.200
<i>Out there! Spread out!</i>

01:15:57.201 --> 01:15:58.879
<i>We need men now!</i>

01:16:31.602 --> 01:16:32.905
Ah!

01:16:40.712 --> 01:16:42.594
<i>Please don't cut...</i>

01:16:57.594 --> 01:16:59.132
Get the fucker off me!

01:17:01.132 --> 01:17:03.266
Lead officer Truman
to security command,

01:17:03.267 --> 01:17:06.168
Requesting immediate reinforcements.
Code black.

01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:07.937
I repeat - code black.

01:17:07.938 --> 01:17:09.807
<i>Where the fuck are you guys?</i>

01:17:09.808 --> 01:17:13.043
Sector 12 down.
Sector 8 down.

01:17:13.044 --> 01:17:15.279
<i>- Sector 3 down.
- Jesus Christ!</i>

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:18.114
Why aren't the defenses working?
Where's the fucking gas?

01:17:18.115 --> 01:17:20.149
Something chewed through the
connections in the utility shaft.

01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:21.989
- Something which?
- Something scary!

01:17:27.624 --> 01:17:30.260
Oh!

01:17:55.652 --> 01:17:58.691
The north exit is blocked.
You can't go there!

01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:01.658
Where are you going?

01:18:01.659 --> 01:18:06.229
# Hush, little baby,
don't say a word... #

01:18:21.379 --> 01:18:22.816
Go, go, go. Go.

01:18:33.124 --> 01:18:34.392
Ooh.

01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:14.931
Fuck, we're running
out of time!

01:19:14.932 --> 01:19:17.307
It's on lockdown.
I'm trying to bypass.

01:19:28.413 --> 01:19:30.014
Oh!

01:19:31.014 --> 01:19:33.397
Hadley!

01:20:02.813 --> 01:20:04.948
Aw, come on!

01:20:13.257 --> 01:20:15.825
- Oh, my god.
- God.

01:20:15.826 --> 01:20:16.896
<i>No, no!</i>

01:20:34.312 --> 01:20:36.387
Gah! Oh.

01:20:44.387 --> 01:20:46.294
It's you.

01:20:51.294 --> 01:20:55.535
No, no, please, please,
please, please.

01:20:58.535 --> 01:21:00.945
Kill him.

01:21:07.945 --> 01:21:10.180
Okay, Dana, come on.

01:21:10.181 --> 01:21:11.551
Dana.

01:21:13.551 --> 01:21:16.370
Here, it's easier with this.

01:22:21.485 --> 01:22:23.356
Look at these.

01:22:26.356 --> 01:22:28.123
<i>Five of them.</i>

01:22:28.124 --> 01:22:30.597
What are they?

01:22:32.597 --> 01:22:33.865
Us.

01:22:34.865 --> 01:22:37.369
<i>I should have seen it
like you did.</i>

01:22:38.369 --> 01:22:40.537
This is part of a ritual.

01:22:40.538 --> 01:22:44.244
A ritual sacrifice?

01:22:46.244 --> 01:22:50.079
Great. You tie someone
to a stone,

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.382
Get a fancy dagger
and a bunch of robes.

01:22:53.383 --> 01:22:55.485
- It's not that complicated.
- No.

01:22:55.486 --> 01:22:57.654
It's simple.

01:22:57.655 --> 01:23:00.627
They don't just want
to see us killed.

01:23:02.627 --> 01:23:05.361
They want to see us punished.

01:23:05.362 --> 01:23:07.497
Punished for what?

01:23:07.498 --> 01:23:10.339
For being young.

01:23:16.339 --> 01:23:18.507
It's different
in every culture.

01:23:18.508 --> 01:23:20.410
And it has changed
over the years,

01:23:20.411 --> 01:23:23.646
<i>But it has always
required youth.</i>

01:23:23.647 --> 01:23:27.219
There must be at least five.

01:23:29.219 --> 01:23:32.055
The whore...
She's corrupted.

01:23:32.056 --> 01:23:33.592
She dies first.

01:23:34.592 --> 01:23:36.262
The athlete.

01:23:38.262 --> 01:23:40.529
<i>The scholar.</i>

01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:42.699
The fool.

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.403
All suffer and die
at the hands of...

01:23:46.404 --> 01:23:49.338
<i>Whatever horror
they have raised,</i>

01:23:49.339 --> 01:23:52.508
Leaving the last to live or die

01:23:52.509 --> 01:23:55.080
as fate decides...

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.584
The virgin.

01:24:00.584 --> 01:24:03.352
Me? Virgin?

01:24:03.353 --> 01:24:06.424
We work with what we have.

01:24:07.424 --> 01:24:09.192
But what if you
don't pull it off?

01:24:09.193 --> 01:24:12.294
<i>- They rise.
- Who does?</i>

01:24:12.295 --> 01:24:14.497
What's beneath us?

01:24:14.498 --> 01:24:18.668
<i>The ancient ones... The gods
that used to rule the earth.</i>

01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:21.303
As long as they accept
our sacrifice,

01:24:21.304 --> 01:24:23.306
They remain below.

01:24:23.307 --> 01:24:25.209
But the other rituals
have all failed.

01:24:28.411 --> 01:24:31.213
The sun is coming up
in eight minutes.

01:24:31.214 --> 01:24:33.984
If you live to see it,
the world will end.

01:24:33.985 --> 01:24:37.153
Maybe that's the way
it should be.

01:24:37.154 --> 01:24:40.123
<i>If you've got to kill
all my friends to survive,</i>

01:24:40.124 --> 01:24:42.092
Maybe it's time for a change.

01:24:42.093 --> 01:24:44.461
We're not talking about change.

01:24:44.462 --> 01:24:46.663
We're talking about
the agonizing death

01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:48.765
of every human soul
on the planet,

01:24:48.766 --> 01:24:51.301
<i>Including you.</i>

01:24:51.302 --> 01:24:54.471
You can die with them

01:24:54.472 --> 01:24:57.410
or you can die for them.

01:24:59.410 --> 01:25:02.428
Gosh, they're both so enticing.

01:25:18.428 --> 01:25:21.530
Wow.

01:25:21.531 --> 01:25:23.499
The whole world, Marty.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.237
<i>Is in your hands, Dana.</i>

01:25:27.237 --> 01:25:29.638
There is no other way.

01:25:29.639 --> 01:25:32.675
<i>You have to be strong.</i>

01:25:32.676 --> 01:25:35.544
Yeah, Dana,

01:25:35.545 --> 01:25:37.383
You feeling strong?

01:25:40.383 --> 01:25:42.588
I'm sorry.

01:25:44.588 --> 01:25:46.288
So am i.

01:25:48.092 --> 01:25:50.571
I got it!

01:26:28.665 --> 01:26:31.105
Marty.

01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:35.471
Ah.

01:26:35.472 --> 01:26:37.482
Marty.

01:27:31.262 --> 01:27:32.432
Hey.

01:27:36.432 --> 01:27:38.437
You know...

01:27:41.437 --> 01:27:44.810
I don't think Curt
even has a cousin.

01:27:46.810 --> 01:27:47.915
Huh.

01:27:51.915 --> 01:27:53.920
How are you?

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.493
Going away.

01:28:02.493 --> 01:28:04.196
I'm sorry.

01:28:06.196 --> 01:28:09.531
I'm so sorry I almost shot you.

01:28:09.532 --> 01:28:11.534
I probably wouldn't have.

01:28:11.535 --> 01:28:15.637
Hey, hey, no.
Shh. No.

01:28:15.638 --> 01:28:18.553
I totally get it.

01:28:30.553 --> 01:28:33.323
I'm sorry I let you
get attacked by a werewolf

01:28:33.324 --> 01:28:36.391
and then ended the world.

01:28:36.392 --> 01:28:38.694
No.

01:28:38.695 --> 01:28:41.333
You were right.

01:28:42.333 --> 01:28:44.275
Humanity...

01:28:51.275 --> 01:28:53.943
It's time to give
someone else a chance.

01:29:05.321 --> 01:29:08.030
Giant evil gods.

01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:16.031
I wish I could have seen them.

01:29:16.032 --> 01:29:18.536
I know.

01:29:20.536 --> 01:29:22.937
That would have been
a fun weekend.

01:30:05.581 --> 01:30:07.784
<i># Gave up trying to
figure it out #</i>

01:30:07.785 --> 01:30:11.020
<i># But my head got lost
along the way #</i>

01:30:11.021 --> 01:30:13.021
<i># Worn out from giving it up #</i>

01:30:13.022 --> 01:30:16.092
<i># My soul,
I pissed it all away #</i>

01:30:16.093 --> 01:30:18.561
<i># Still stings
these shattered nerves #</i>

01:30:18.562 --> 01:30:21.763
<i># Pigs, we get
what pigs deserve #</i>

01:30:21.764 --> 01:30:26.769
<i># I'm going all the way down,
I知 leaving today #</i>

01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:29.504
<i># Come, come, come on,
you've gotta fill me up #</i>

01:30:29.505 --> 01:30:32.408
<i># Come, come,
gotta let me inside you #</i>

01:30:32.409 --> 01:30:35.011
<i># Come, come, come on,
you gotta fix me up #</i>

01:30:35.012 --> 01:30:37.802
<i># Come, come,
gotta let me inside you #</i>

01:30:58.802 --> 01:31:00.970
<i># Still feel
it all slipping away #</i>

01:31:00.971 --> 01:31:04.440
<i># But it doesn't
matter anymore #</i>

01:31:04.441 --> 01:31:06.441
<i># Everybody's
still slipping away #</i>

01:31:06.442 --> 01:31:09.745
<i># But it doesn't
matter anymore #</i>

01:31:09.746 --> 01:31:12.547
<i># Look through
these blackened eyes #</i>

01:31:12.548 --> 01:31:15.083
<i># You'll see 10,000 lies #</i>

01:31:15.084 --> 01:31:19.955
<i># My lips may promise,
but my heart is a whore #</i>

01:31:19.956 --> 01:31:22.891
<i># Come, come, come on,
you've gotta fix me up #</i>

01:31:22.892 --> 01:31:25.694
<i># Come, come,
gotta let me inside you #</i>

01:31:25.695 --> 01:31:28.132
<i># Come, come, come on,
you gotta fill me up #</i>

01:31:28.133 --> 01:31:30.999
<i># Come, come, gotta let me
get through to you #</i>

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.102
<i># This isn't meant to last #</i>

01:31:34.103 --> 01:31:36.471
<i># This is for right now #</i>

01:31:36.472 --> 01:31:39.108
<i># This isn't meant to last #</i>

01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:42.043

01:31:47.084 --> 01:31:50.052
<i># This isn't meant to last #</i>

01:31:50.053 --> 01:31:52.444
<i># This is for right #</i>

01:32:13.444 --> 01:32:15.845
<i># I know
it's all getting away #</i>

01:32:15.846 --> 01:32:18.815
<i># And it comes to me
as no surprise #</i>

01:32:18.816 --> 01:32:20.983
<i># And I know
what's coming to me #</i>

01:32:20.984 --> 01:32:24.220
<i># Is never going to arrive #</i>

01:32:24.221 --> 01:32:27.022

<i># Dress up
