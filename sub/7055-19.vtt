to step out of it...

11:06.452 --> 11:08.787
the gas will have
resolidified,

11:08.854 --> 11:10.038

11:10.123 --> 11:12.491
Couldn't we just
push him out?

too freely.

you and your team were--

14:43.245 --> 14:44.912

<i>It looks as if he's experienced</i>
<i>some sort of trauma.</i>

16:03.141 --> 16:04.709

of the Amber.

16:07.613 --> 16:09.447

16:55.694 --> 16:57.462
They've been back-ordered now

16:57.529 --> 17:00.748
Well, I don't know how
to break this to you, Agent,

17:00.833 --> 17:02.216
but your
department's needs

17:02.301 --> 17:04.335
are the lowest thing

17:04.386 --> 17:07.221
I understand that it's--

17:07.306 --> 17:10.508
And how is it that

17:13.479 --> 17:17.647
Walk me to my car.

17:26.223 --> 17:29.360
Well, yes and no.

17:40.756 --> 17:44.842
And the others. Are they--
unclear.

17:44.910 --> 17:46.711
<i>If Dr. Bishop knows</i>
<i>where they are,</i>

17:46.762 --> 17:48.379
he's unable to tell us.

17:48.430 --> 17:51.516
And why not?

17:51.583 --> 17:55.686
- Do I know you?
- Yes, Walter.

17:55.754 --> 17:58.940
It's Nina.
Nina Sharp.

17:59.024 --> 18:01.859
We've known each other
for many years.

18:01.927 --> 18:04.061
It's good to see you again.

18:04.112 --> 18:09.033
In that case,
it's good to see you too.

18:20.045 --> 18:23.581
So what do you think,
Ms. Sharp?

18:23.632 --> 18:26.083
Can you help fix him?

18:26.134 --> 18:28.252
Of course,
you understand the risks

18:28.303 --> 18:30.338
of wanting to save the world?

18:30.422 --> 18:33.057
Well, they say
he did it once before.

18:33.124 --> 18:38.012
He and his team.

18:38.096 --> 18:39.263
Yes, they did.

18:39.314 --> 18:43.851
But not without
great consequence.

18:43.936 --> 18:48.105
I can't fix him.
But I have an idea.

18:48.156 --> 18:51.859
Massive Dynamic has long had
a piece of Walter's brain

18:51.944 --> 18:54.946
that was surgically removed
and kept in a locked vault.

18:54.997 --> 18:58.833
It's entirely possible
that you could use that material

18:58.917 --> 19:01.335
to inspire Walter's brain
to heal itself.

19:01.420 --> 19:02.920
They removed a piece
of his brain?

19:02.988 --> 19:04.872
William Bell did.

19:04.957 --> 19:07.425
It was at
Walter's request.

19:07.492 --> 19:09.510
Why?

19:09.595 --> 19:13.514
I don't think he liked
the person he was becoming.

19:15.834 --> 19:18.803
So can you go get it
and bring it out here?

19:18.854 --> 19:21.055
Well, no,
it's not as simple as that.

19:21.139 --> 19:24.025
The old brain tissue
is very fragile.

19:24.109 --> 19:26.310
Neural matter can decay
in seconds.

19:26.361 --> 19:28.279
You can't just carry it around
in a petri dish.

19:28.346 --> 19:29.780
<i>Why do I feel...</i>

19:29.848 --> 19:33.701
like you're trying
to bury the lead?

19:33.785 --> 19:35.703
The material isn't here.

19:35.787 --> 19:40.207
It's still
at our old facility.

19:40.292 --> 19:42.710
In the city.

19:50.218 --> 19:53.754
That's
wall-to-wall Observers.

19:53.839 --> 19:58.175
We've done harder.

19:58.226 --> 19:59.644
No, we haven't.

20:04.002 --> 20:07.651
- You really should get this fixed.
- Hmm. All right, Simon.

20:07.864 --> 20:09.448
Walter, stop it.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.500
No, we've just been catching up.

20:11.568 --> 20:13.119
<i>Yes.</i>

20:13.203 --> 20:14.620
<i>No, he'll be ready</i>
<i>when you get here.</i>

20:14.704 --> 20:16.205
Walter,

20:16.256 --> 20:18.040
Etta and Simon got
the transit passes.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.758
What on earth are you doing?

20:19.843 --> 20:21.210
Try it.

20:21.261 --> 20:24.046
Wh--

20:24.097 --> 20:28.300
Oh.

20:28.385 --> 20:31.053
I hope we're going
to the circus.

20:31.104 --> 20:34.523
Walter.

21:06.256 --> 21:07.840
Snacks.

21:07.924 --> 21:12.561
Do you think they'd have any
of that delicious lic--

21:12.629 --> 21:14.146
Monster.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.233
<i>Shh. It's okay.</i>
- Monster!

21:17.300 --> 21:19.018
- We got to get him off the street.
-  <i>Hold up there.</i>

21:19.102 --> 21:21.270
What seems to be the matter?

21:21.321 --> 21:23.439
Fringe Agents.
No matter.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.242
- We're just heading downtown.
- I see.

21:26.309 --> 21:27.576
I trust you have papers.

21:27.644 --> 21:32.998
Of course.

21:37.487 --> 21:39.421
What's your name, prisoner?

21:39.489 --> 21:40.539
Prisoner?

21:40.624 --> 21:44.293
I most certainly am not.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.678
Look at me!
Do I look like--

21:45.762 --> 21:48.097
He's--he's not
a prisoner.

21:48.164 --> 21:49.882
He's her grandfather.

21:49.966 --> 21:52.218
We're taking him to visit
my grandmother's grave.

21:52.302 --> 21:54.103
<i>Today's the anniversary</i>
<i>of her death.</i>

21:54.170 --> 21:58.357
"I am not a number.
I am a free man."

21:58.441 --> 22:00.776
As you can see,
He's crazy.

22:00.843 --> 22:03.362
We just checked him out
of the home for the day.

22:03.446 --> 22:05.231
But it was last minute,

22:05.315 --> 22:08.150
and we didn't have time
to do the proper paperwork.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.869
"These aren't the 'droids
you're looking for."

22:10.954 --> 22:15.524
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you can understand.

22:27.036 --> 22:29.221
Next time,
I won't be so nice.

22:29.306 --> 22:34.042
- Thank you.
- "Move along."

22:37.647 --> 22:41.233
Nice.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.627
- You okay?
- Yes. Wonderful.

23:08.712 --> 23:10.629
It's quite the adventure,
isn't it?

23:10.714 --> 23:12.881
Yeah, I suppose it is.

23:12.932 --> 23:14.850
Like <i>The Guns of Navarone.</i>

23:25.428 --> 23:26.445
<i>Deja vu.</i>

23:26.529 --> 23:29.198
What?

23:29.265 --> 23:31.450
I feel like
I've been here before.

23:31.534 --> 23:33.402
<i>You have.</i>

23:33.453 --> 23:34.737
<i>Man times,</i>
<i>I imagine.</i>

23:34.788 --> 23:37.039
Though that was
a long time ago.

23:37.106 --> 23:39.541
I hope
it was cleaner then.

23:39.609 --> 23:43.278
Dust is revolting.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.761
Sir,

23:58.812 --> 24:00.312
there's been a break-in
at the old Massive Dynamic.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.414
- Massive Dynamic?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

24:02.482 --> 24:03.999
<i>Underground</i>
<i>parking garage.</i>

24:04.067 --> 24:05.934
Are we sure it isn't
a fault in the system?

24:05.985 --> 24:08.420
- It's been buggy lately.
- <i>I ran diagnostics.</i>

24:08.488 --> 24:12.991
<i>It's not a false alarm.</i>

24:25.672 --> 24:28.173
This is Agent Broyles.

24:28.258 --> 24:31.493
I need to talk
to Captain Windmark.

24:48.978 --> 24:51.947
How's it look?

24:52.014 --> 24:53.582
I can't say.

24:53.650 --> 24:55.901
I have no idea
how it's supposed to look.

24:55.985 --> 24:58.620
What is that?
Monkey feces?

24:58.688 --> 25:02.991
That, Dr. Bishop,
is your brain.

25:03.042 --> 25:06.044
We need an inactive medium
to transfer the neural tissue.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.330
A mixture of saline
and polysorbate 80.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.548
Three CCs of each.

25:09.632 --> 25:11.049
Have you seen it?

25:11.117 --> 25:13.085
Monkey feces? No.

25:13.169 --> 25:14.586
I can't say
I've had the pleasure.

25:14.671 --> 25:17.172
I wouldn't say
that it was a pleasure.

25:17.223 --> 25:20.392
First, I need you
to take these pills.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.511
They're Diazepam, mostly.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.680
They'll put you
into a deep sleep,

25:24.731 --> 25:27.015
for ten minutes,
that will quiet your brain

25:27.066 --> 25:28.684
to allow the process
to occur faster.

25:28.735 --> 25:31.820
You're a clever boy.

25:31.888 --> 25:34.072
Dare I ask?

25:34.157 --> 25:35.824
Synthetic neurotrophins.

25:35.892 --> 25:37.409
Growth proteins.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.578
If this process works,
it should allow his brain

25:39.662 --> 25:41.663
to absorb the missing tissue
in a matter of minutes.

25:41.731 --> 25:43.081
I've eaten it once.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.666
It was sweeter
than you'd think.

25:44.734 --> 25:46.118
Feces?

25:46.202 --> 25:48.120
God, no.

25:48.204 --> 25:51.757
Brains.

25:55.879 --> 25:59.548
And LSD.

25:59.599 --> 26:05.521
I love LSD.

26:05.588 --> 26:07.356
Ready.

26:07.423 --> 26:09.107
Dr. Bishop,
we're going to inject

26:09.192 --> 26:11.154
that solution into the base
of your brain.

26:11.179 --> 26:12.379
Oh, fun.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.547
What was your name, again?

26:15.615 --> 26:18.116
- Simon.
- Simon.

26:18.201 --> 26:20.569
Like in the game
"Simon Says."

26:20.620 --> 26:23.405
I'm going to have
to listen to you.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.040
Isn't that right,
young lady?

26:25.107 --> 26:26.909
Yes, he's a very smart boy.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.044
Okay, this may
look scary, but--

26:29.111 --> 26:32.714
I suddenly feel
very tired, Simon.

26:32.782 --> 26:36.585
Here.

26:36.636 --> 26:41.590
Simon says,
"Go to sleep now, Walter."

26:55.805 --> 26:59.591
What if this
doesn't work?

26:59.659 --> 27:03.161
<i>Dr. Bishop?</i>

27:03.229 --> 27:06.999
It has to.

27:10.837 --> 27:13.505
When I was in
my freshman year at college--

27:13.590 --> 27:15.624
<i>I'm at Stanford.</i>

27:15.675 --> 27:17.125
<i>And in the middle</i>
<i>of the night,</i>

27:17.176 --> 27:19.461
my roommate comes banging
on my door.

27:19.512 --> 27:24.883
Tells me to wake up,
come check out the TV.

27:24.968 --> 27:26.134
I tell him to go away.

27:26.185 --> 27:28.437
I...

27:28.504 --> 27:30.856
I have a girl in my bed.

27:30.924 --> 27:33.475
<i>But he won't take no</i>
<i>for an answer.</i>

27:33.526 --> 27:36.445
So me and the girl...

27:36.512 --> 27:38.614
Emily...

27:38.681 --> 27:40.399
We get dressed,

27:40.483 --> 27:44.820
go to the common room.

27:44.887 --> 27:47.456
On the TV they're showing
footage from...

27:47.523 --> 27:52.094
Chicago, L.A...

27:52.161 --> 27:55.497
London.

27:55.565 --> 27:58.567
Observers going
from house to house and...

27:58.635 --> 28:00.168
<i>dragging people out</i>
<i>into the street.</i>

28:00.236 --> 28:03.956
That was 2015.
The Purge.

28:04.023 --> 28:07.776
I'm watching people...

28:07.844 --> 28:09.611
Being dragged from their homes,

28:09.679 --> 28:12.114
led into the street,
and being...

28:12.181 --> 28:16.485
put down like dogs.

28:16.552 --> 28:18.620
<i>And suddenly...</i>

28:18.688 --> 28:22.574
<i>I knew.</i>

28:22.659 --> 28:25.327
I don't know how, but...

28:25.395 --> 28:30.832
I knew.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.251
<i>That's...</i>

28:33.319 --> 28:38.423
<i>why my parents sent me</i>
<i>so far away for school.</i>

28:38.508 --> 28:42.628
They were part
of the resistance. They--

28:42.712 --> 28:48.600
they sent me away
to protect me.

28:48.685 --> 28:52.954
That was the night
they were killed.

28:53.022 --> 28:55.824
<i>And that was the night...</i>

28:55.892 --> 29:00.862
I knew I wouldn't give up...

29:00.930 --> 29:05.567
until the Observers had gone.

29:08.938 --> 29:13.108
You never told me that.

29:15.745 --> 29:20.549
I never told anyone that.

29:23.986 --> 29:27.789
I was only four
the last time I saw my parents.

29:32.962 --> 29:36.765
I can't even picture
their faces anymore.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.499
Dr. Bishop?

29:54.584 --> 29:55.667
Are you okay?

30:00.640 --> 30:04.259
I believe that's mine,
young man.

30:06.963 --> 30:08.680
Agent Simon Foster.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.215
Fringe Division.

30:10.299 --> 30:12.134
Pleased to meet you, sir.

30:12.201 --> 30:14.453
- What year is it?
- 2036.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.138
And they're still here?

30:16.205 --> 30:21.560
The Observers?

30:31.020 --> 30:32.571
<i>Assessment?</i>

30:32.655 --> 30:34.489
<i>Sir, I count three sets</i>
<i>of footprints.</i>

30:34.540 --> 30:35.824
Ready weapons.

30:37.877 --> 30:40.078
Protocol?

30:40.163 --> 30:42.247
Shoot first.

30:42.315 --> 30:44.049
I'll read them later.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.165
<i>Sir, 12th floor is clear.</i>

30:51.220 --> 30:54.506
Okay, proceed to the 13th.

30:55.590 --> 30:58.809
<i>Can you build it?</i>

30:58.894 --> 31:02.480
Walter?

31:05.100 --> 31:09.520
They weren't all bad,
you know.

31:09.604 --> 31:11.572
One of them even tried
to help us.

31:11.639 --> 31:14.024
<i>He was called September.</i>

31:14.109 --> 31:17.161
What happened to him was...

31:17.245 --> 31:19.997
well, unexpected.

31:20.081 --> 31:25.453
He told me that,
in the year 2609 A.D.,

31:25.504 --> 31:30.791
they finally ruined the planet.

31:30.842 --> 31:32.092
They poisoned it--

31:32.160 --> 31:35.012
<i>the air, the water.</i>

31:35.080 --> 31:38.132
<i>And when it was</i>
<i>fundamentally uninhabitable,</i>

31:38.183 --> 31:40.017
then they traveled
back through time,

31:40.101 --> 31:44.605
and took our planet from us.

31:46.658 --> 31:48.476
Yes, I can build it.

31:48.527 --> 31:50.444
Okay, good.

31:50.512 --> 31:53.948
It'll take some time.

31:54.015 --> 31:55.816
But it would be easier if you
didn't have to do it alone.

31:55.867 --> 31:57.535
Wouldn't it?

31:57.619 --> 32:00.037
If you had your team
with you to help you?

32:00.121 --> 32:03.874
You were trapped
in Amber with them, right?

32:03.959 --> 32:06.327
Do you remember
where that was?

32:06.378 --> 32:11.916
Do you remember
where we can find the others?

32:12.000 --> 32:16.403
You.

32:18.223 --> 32:19.723
Elevator.

32:19.808 --> 32:22.760
Did you forget to disable
the internal alarms?

32:22.844 --> 32:26.063
What are you people?
Idiots?

32:26.147 --> 32:28.399
This way.

32:31.152 --> 32:33.153
Neither Belly or I
ever left ourselves

32:33.221 --> 32:37.992
only one way out of a room.
Come on.

32:43.565 --> 32:46.116
Warm.
They were just here.

32:46.201 --> 32:50.337
So how'd they get out?

32:50.405 --> 32:54.925
Step back.

32:57.596 --> 32:59.597
Keep going!

32:59.681 --> 33:04.418
Two lefts and a right.

33:07.088 --> 33:09.306
How do we open it?

33:09.391 --> 33:14.445
What?
Where's Bishop?
