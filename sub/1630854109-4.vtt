00:49.483 --> 00:51.085
Julie, make sure you pack
your science project

00:51.185 --> 00:52.620
for your dad's tonight!

00:52.720 --> 00:54.155
Alex!

00:54.255 --> 00:57.358
Oh, hey. Morning.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.127
Morning.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.729
You're ready early and
making breakfast that requires

01:01.829 --> 01:03.464
something more than a toaster.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.632
What's the occasion?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.534
I thought you'd approve.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.403
Okay.

01:10.438 --> 01:11.872
I do.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.008
Cassandra's been pushing me
to eat healthier.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.677
High protein. Low carb.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.212
Says it makes you feel better.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.647
She's actually right.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.814
Oh, yeah?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.983
Go figure.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.288
You know,

01:27.388 --> 01:28.689
you two have been spending

01:28.789 --> 01:30.224
a lot of time together lately.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.859
Can we officially call her
your girlfriend now?

01:31.959 --> 01:33.994
Or are kids these days
not doing that?

01:34.094 --> 01:36.430
How about we just
call her Cassandra?

01:36.530 --> 01:38.666
Okay.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.701
Well, I'd like to meet her. Totally.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.171
We should make that happen.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.906
We should. Say...

01:46.006 --> 01:47.508
tonight?

01:48.776 --> 01:50.811
Julie and I are at Dad's.
Well, how about

01:50.911 --> 01:53.414
you and Cassandra come by here
for dinner first,

01:53.514 --> 01:54.882
and I'll make something special?
I mean,

01:54.982 --> 01:56.917
it's kind of late notice,
she's probably got plans.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.419
Why don't you ask?

01:59.387 --> 02:00.754
I will.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.724
Oh, you mean now?

02:03.824 --> 02:05.326
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.295
I'll text her.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.263
You promise you'll be cool?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.832
I'm always cool.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.573
Careful where you step.
Area's still a mess

02:19.673 --> 02:21.375
from the storm last week.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.743
Body washed down
from up top?

02:22.843 --> 02:24.144
Yeah, looks that way.

02:24.245 --> 02:27.748
Deceased is Seaman Apprentice
Ella Baird.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.618
Reported missing
a few months ago.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.287
Yeah, she went for a hike
and never returned.

02:33.387 --> 02:36.590
Guess we know why.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.759
Morning, Commander Chase.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.728
Not for some of us,
I'm afraid.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.496
Baird went missing
three months ago.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.131
She been out here
that whole time?

02:44.232 --> 02:45.366
Well, hard to tell.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.800
I'd expect even
more decomposition

02:46.900 --> 02:48.369
if she'd been exposed
to the elements.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.070
So she was buried?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.239
Almost certainly.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.706
And probably

02:52.806 --> 02:55.142
enclosed in some kind
of protective covering.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.277
Cause of death?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.611
I'll need
a proper examination,

02:57.711 --> 03:00.281
but so far I've seen
no evidence of foul play.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.250
Other than being buried
in the middle of the woods

03:02.350 --> 03:03.651
in a protective covering.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.753
Yes, other than that.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.721
Well, we'd appreciate
any information you can get us.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.123
Her family's waited
a long time for answers.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.992
It's my calling.

03:12.793 --> 03:16.397
Body probably washed down
from up on that hill.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.898
Yeah.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.901
So, why is our team
still down here?

03:21.669 --> 03:22.936
Is there an issue?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.505
I was explaining that
the area up there

03:24.605 --> 03:26.274
may be a crime scene,
so we need access.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.642
And I was just explaining
that area is kapu--

03:28.742 --> 03:30.711
off-limits to everyone,
not just outsiders.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.112
You're the Office
of Hawaiian Affairs.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.014
Ava Nakama.
It's my job to protect

03:34.114 --> 03:35.583
Native Hawaiian sites
like this.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.117
I understand,
and it is our job

03:37.217 --> 03:39.920
to investigate suspicious
deaths wherever they may lead.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.523
May I ask,
why is this considered kapu?

03:42.623 --> 03:45.092
It's a <i>luakini heiau.</i>

03:45.192 --> 03:46.427
It's a temple

03:46.527 --> 03:48.262
where sacrifices were made.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.298
Human sacrifices?

03:50.398 --> 03:52.165
Humans and animals, yes.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.701
It's a sacred place.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.603
And I am sensitive to that,

03:55.703 --> 03:57.070
but we believe
the woman's body we found

03:57.170 --> 04:00.908
may have washed down
from that sacred place.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.112
Do you all have to go?

04:06.046 --> 04:09.116
Well, my team and I can go up
first, take a look.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.718
But eventually

04:10.818 --> 04:13.487
these other folks will have
to get up there, too.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.222
In shifts.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.025
It's the best I can do.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.962
Okay. Thank you.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.697
We will treat the <i>luakini</i>

04:23.797 --> 04:25.733
with the respect it deserves.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.801
<i>Pau Pele, pau mano.</i>

04:34.708 --> 04:36.444
Forget something this morning?

04:36.544 --> 04:37.545
Hey, where'd you find it?

04:37.645 --> 04:38.779
Behind the couch.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.348
You wore the other one here?

04:40.448 --> 04:42.282
I was running late, but I had
a backup shoe in the car,

04:42.383 --> 04:43.551
so all good.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.218
Backup shoe?

04:45.319 --> 04:47.187
Yeah, don't you keep extras
in the car?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.556
Yeah, of course. Extras.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.023
As in plural, not just one.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.625
I mean,
how do you even know

04:51.725 --> 04:53.026
if you're gonna lose
the left or the right?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.495
Well, that's just
a silly question.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.263
Oh! Am I interrupting

04:56.364 --> 04:58.399
a glass slipper situation?

04:58.499 --> 04:59.967
Not at all.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.870
Were you able to get into
Baird's social media accounts?

05:02.970 --> 05:05.639
Yeah, nothing suspicious.
She wasn't very active online.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.375
Yeah, I heard the same
from her CO.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.909
He said she was mostly a loner.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.544
There's nothing wrong
with being a loner.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.780
She did hit
one site a lot.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.147
Baird was really
into hiking.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.849
Usually posted
reviews and photos

05:15.949 --> 05:17.451
on one of those
hiking trails apps.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.388
Her last review was posted
the day she went missing.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.856
She was hiking
in Pu'u Konahuanui.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.092
Oh, that's interesting.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.361
Why is that interesting?

05:27.461 --> 05:29.897
'Cause her body was discovered
on the Kuaokala Trail.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.866
Completely on the other side
of the island.

05:38.472 --> 05:41.742
Couple hundred years ago,
this was a temple to Ku.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.811
God of war.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.746
There's a lot of legends
of angry spirits

05:45.846 --> 05:47.180
around <i>luakini heiau.</i>

05:47.280 --> 05:49.450
They actually
sacrificed people here?

05:49.550 --> 05:52.486
Well, the priests believed
it would earn Ku's favor,

05:52.586 --> 05:54.488
help the chief win battles.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.691
Bet the ones being sacrificed
weren't too hip to that idea.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.493
I'd be an angry spirit myself.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.029
Wouldn't joke about that.
Not here.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.132
Why? You worried
the ghosts are gonna get us?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.201
Are you completely sure
they're not?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.307
Got something.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.848
There's hair inside.
Think it's our sailor's.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.087
Baird might not be
the only victim.

06:27.187 --> 06:31.191
I'm seeing three mounds
about the size of graves.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.893
More bodies?

06:32.993 --> 06:34.928
It's what it looks like.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.768
We're gonna need
to excavate them.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.670
Hawaiian Affairs rep's
not gonna like that.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.237
It can't be helped.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.940
We need to find out if
they're recent or historical.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.613
Think I just found
the answer to that one.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.004
This is such a violation.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.472
I'm sorry.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.641
We're doing everything we
can to protect the area.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.511
Not your people.
Whoever did this...

07:25.078 --> 07:27.414
...you need to catch them.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.484
Yeah.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.686
That's the last one.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.722
So, four victims
in addition to Ella Baird.

07:34.822 --> 07:35.923
Any idea what...?

07:36.023 --> 07:37.725
One moment,
Agent Boone.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.593
Through your blessing,
grace and guidance,

07:39.693 --> 07:41.795
through the power of the light
that streams from you:

07:41.895 --> 07:44.732
May all the negative karma,
destructive emotions,

07:44.832 --> 07:48.401
obscurations and blockages
be purified and removed.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.170
It's the Tibetan
Dying Prayer.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.739
What?

07:51.839 --> 07:52.906
I read.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.075
You were asking
if I know how they died.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.343
I don't.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.311
There are no visible
signs of injury.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.947
No bullet wounds,
ligature marks.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.949
Could they have been
wrapped up first

08:02.049 --> 08:03.651
and buried alive?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.152
Oh, I like the way you think.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.220
Uh, it's possible.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.557
But I'd expect to see
more petechial hemorrhaging

08:09.657 --> 08:10.858
if that was the case.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.693
Any idea how long
they've been here?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.427
Well, I'll test to confirm,
but I believe

08:14.528 --> 08:15.863
they were all buried
at different times.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.430
Your sailor appears to be
the most recent,

08:17.531 --> 08:20.000
but the others span
at least five years.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.703
So someone's been disposing
of victims here a long time.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.938
Kapu area's a perfect spot
for hiding bodies.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.940
I guess we're lucky
the storm came through.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.241
Might never have found them.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.177
You say luck,
I say providence.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.378
I get a feeling
the spirits here

08:31.478 --> 08:33.981
find this
as disturbing as we do.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.450
What, does she think
the ghosts have shovels?

08:38.251 --> 08:40.921
I'm telling you, man,
wouldn't joke about it.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.125
<i>Any progress identifying</i>

08:45.225 --> 08:46.393
the other victims?

08:46.493 --> 08:47.695
We just tracked down
the last one.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.329
Susan Chan and Trent Watkins

08:49.429 --> 08:50.698
had licenses on them.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.666
She was from Oklahoma,
he was from Idaho.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.234
Both tourists?
Yeah.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.569
So were the other two.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.771
We found them in
the missing persons databases.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.708
Michael Ianucci
and Melanie Renaud.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.075
She's French,

09:02.175 --> 09:03.777
wasn't even reported missing
for a couple of months.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.545
Did any of them have
a connection to Ella Baird?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.681
Nothing except for
how they went missing.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.650
All were on solo hikes
when they disappeared.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.785
Not as unusual as you'd think.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.622
Over 1,600 people go missing
in national parks every year.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.658
How much time
between disappearances?

09:19.026 --> 09:20.493
First one was

09:20.594 --> 09:21.895
five years ago.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.496
Second, year and
a half later.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.133
But barely six months
between the last two.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.467
So, they're increasing
in frequency.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.535
Mm-hmm.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.637
I know Commander Chase hasn't

09:29.737 --> 09:31.271
determined cause of death yet,

09:31.371 --> 09:33.206
but someone went
to a lot of trouble

09:33.306 --> 09:34.642
to hide those bodies.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.076
And it seems like
there's a ritualistic element

09:36.176 --> 09:37.444
to where they were buried.

09:37.544 --> 09:38.846
Hey.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.148
So, the last guy we just ID'd,
Michael Ianucci.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.484
He was actually an airman
with the Coast Guard.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.053
Did CGIS investigate?

09:46.153 --> 09:47.554
Oh, yeah.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.423
They put one of
their best agents on it.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.966
A-Team, back together again!

09:59.066 --> 10:00.233
Huh?

10:00.333 --> 10:01.334
Jess, good to see you.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.435
Yeah.
Appreciate you coming

10:02.535 --> 10:03.503
so quickly, Neil.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.972
Well, time was of the essence.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.040
Looks like we're looking at
a serial killer here, huh?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.742
It's a possibility.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.010
Well, it's good
you brought me in.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.511
I'm kind of an expert.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.714
Really? On serial killers?

10:13.814 --> 10:16.449
I'm sort of the CGIS
resident profiler.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.618
I took a seminar
at Quantico last year.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.821
At the FBI Behavioral
Analysis Unit?

10:20.921 --> 10:23.290
At the Hilton, but the guys
running it were former FBI.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.557
Changed my life.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.359
If you want,
I could work up a profile

10:26.459 --> 10:27.695
on our unsub for the team.

10:27.795 --> 10:30.097
Oh, boy.
Why don't you just share

10:30.197 --> 10:32.666
what you know about Airman
Ianucci's disappearance first?

10:32.766 --> 10:34.968
Right. Excellent idea.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.438
So, I did a pretty exhaustive investigation.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.640
I'm exhausted
just looking at it.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.911
Ianucci was on leave in Hawai'i
two years ago.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.113
He told a friend he was
gonna hike Waimano Falls,

10:46.213 --> 10:47.748
and that was the last
anyone heard from him.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.416
You conducted a search?
Yeah,

10:49.516 --> 10:52.786
we found his phone at the base
of a ravine, but no sign of him.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.522
State Park Police
thought it was an accident?

10:55.622 --> 10:57.457
Yeah, that was the assumption
at the time,

10:57.557 --> 10:59.559
but I was never convinced.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.994
Ianucci was
a mountain climber.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.396
He had plenty
of outdoor experience.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.898
So, you kept investigating?

11:04.998 --> 11:08.401
Yeah, I did, and eventually
I found a suspect.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.503
I spoke to a woman
who was on the trail

11:10.603 --> 11:12.239
the same day
Ianucci disappeared.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.640
She said a scary guy

11:13.741 --> 11:15.308
was following her.
Really freaked her out.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.644
And you think he could have
done something to your airman?

11:17.745 --> 11:20.013
Park rangers said
he'd harassed hikers before.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.415
They call him Joe.
Nobody knows his real name.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.817
He's just a-a vagrant

11:23.917 --> 11:25.552
who lives out in the forests
all over Oahu.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.586
Did you question him?

11:26.686 --> 11:27.788
Couldn't track him down.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.456
Evidently,
he's always on the move.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.091
That would fit with the victims

11:31.191 --> 11:33.126
all having been
in different areas.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.864
Let's send this sketch
to the rangers again.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.833
Maybe they can help locate him,
and I have to get going.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.468
Ooh, you got big dinner plans?

11:41.568 --> 11:43.403
Meeting my son's new girlfriend,
and I still have a meal to make.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.872
I'll get the sketch out.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.473
Thanks.
What about us?

11:46.573 --> 11:48.508
You want to order some takeout,
really dig in here?

11:48.608 --> 11:51.711
I wish I could, but the
fam's expecting me for dinner.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.147
Oh, great. Dinner with
your family sounds awesome.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.219
Hey, Alex, sorry I'm late.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.754
No worries, Mom.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.757
Okay, I got everything
for the huli-huli chicken, so

12:03.857 --> 12:05.826
it won't take me too long...

12:05.926 --> 12:07.094
Hi.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.729
Oh, Alex found some salmon,
so we put that on.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.298
Made a little
mango salsa.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.133
It's just about done.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.301
Wow.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.736
Um... you must be...

12:16.837 --> 12:19.372
Cassandra. It's so great
to finally meet you.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.708
Yeah. You, too.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.845
Everything
smells wonderful.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.848
Yeah, it's been a team effort.
Alex is an incredible sous-chef.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.819
Alex is so helpful
in the kitchen.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.955
Here, just relax.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.390
Cheers.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.860
It's fine, um...

12:40.660 --> 12:42.830
Cass is 21.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.631
21.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.034
Oh, did you not mention that?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.902
Pretty sure I did.
No, you did not.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.838
Sorry, I can totally
put the wine away if...

12:50.938 --> 12:53.173
It's fine. Um, I just...

12:53.273 --> 12:56.343
So, um, does that mean
that you're in college?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.811
Actually, I skipped
the whole college thing.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.579
Just wasn't really my vibe.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.251
So... what is your vibe?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.753
Well, Cass is about

13:06.854 --> 13:08.721
being open to new experiences.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.590
Trying to do a lot more
of that myself.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.492
It's amazing how much
you learn just

13:12.592 --> 13:14.194
going where
the feeling takes you.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.328
Oh, yeah?
Like,

13:15.428 --> 13:16.796
my roommates and I,

13:16.897 --> 13:18.365
we did this energy healing
retreat last month.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.699
Super last-minute
thing,

13:19.799 --> 13:20.934
but it was life-changing.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.202
She's actually teaching me

13:22.302 --> 13:23.937
a lot of the techniques.
It's really cool.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.172
I can show you, too,
if you want.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.674
It will change your life, seriously.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.010
Is that right?

13:31.411 --> 13:32.612
Um...

13:32.712 --> 13:34.547
So... so, roommates?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.816
Yeah, well, there's six of us.
It's kind of crazy,

13:36.917 --> 13:38.952
but rents are just
so insane, right?

13:39.052 --> 13:41.154
Okay, let's eat.
We've got this, Jane.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.191
So, just go ahead
and have a seat.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.596
Dr. Chase?

13:55.768 --> 13:57.905
Are you here?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.242
Hello?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.044
Anybody here?

14:13.786 --> 14:15.355
The hamsa.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.958
A protection
against evil spirits.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.326
Oh.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.161
That sounds useful.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.695
It can be.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.065
What can I do for you,
Agent Tara?

14:25.165 --> 14:26.900
Uh, I was...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.202
heading out. I thought
I'd see if you determined

14:29.302 --> 14:30.904
cause of death.
Well, there was

14:31.004 --> 14:33.006
nothing out of the ordinary
in the tox screens,

14:33.106 --> 14:35.608
and no indications
of external injuries,

14:35.708 --> 14:36.876
other than some abrasions

14:36.977 --> 14:38.578
and bruising
on the extremities.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.846
Defensive wound?

14:39.947 --> 14:41.348
No, more consistent
with injuries

14:41.448 --> 14:43.150
that might have happened
if they'd been running

14:43.250 --> 14:44.584
and fell.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.786
You think they might
have been chased?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.721
I think that's something
I can't possibly know,

14:48.821 --> 14:50.623
and you will
have to find out.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.825
Okay, so no cause
of death.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.627
I didn't say that.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.828
That's her heart.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.264
Indeed.
And I suppose there is

14:57.364 --> 14:58.765
an excellent reason
you're showing that to me

14:58.865 --> 15:00.300
in a not-at-all creepy way?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.203
While the decomposition makes
it impossible to be certain,

15:03.303 --> 15:05.905
I believe Ms. Baird
and all the other victims

15:06.006 --> 15:08.775
died of sudden cardiac arrest.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.944
Their hearts stopped?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.580
But they were all
pretty young and healthy.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.948
How could that happen?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.950
If you want my
very unscientific opinion,

15:17.050 --> 15:19.686
it appears they were,
quite literally,

15:19.786 --> 15:21.921
scared to death.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.401
Morning.
Morning.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.636
Hear anything
from the State Park Police?
Yeah, they say

15:36.736 --> 15:38.605
this Joe guy who Pike suspects

15:38.705 --> 15:40.807
is our "unsub" is still around.

15:40.907 --> 15:41.941
Is he dangerous?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.176
Yeah, sounds like it.
Said he's become

15:43.276 --> 15:44.978
increasingly erratic
over the years.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.146
Harassing hikers.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.847
Destroying park property.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.216
They know where he is?

15:49.316 --> 15:50.517
Not yet, but they're looking.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.818
And Commander Chase

15:51.918 --> 15:53.420
pulled all the victims'
medical records.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.655
None had preexisting
conditions that

15:55.755 --> 15:57.324
might've led to cardiac arrest.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.159
Okay, so we got
a group of lone hikers,

15:59.259 --> 16:00.927
all in good shape.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.295
What else do they have
in common?

16:02.395 --> 16:03.730
Not much.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.999
Different ethnicities,
different backgrounds.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.467
Men and women.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.569
It's an unusual assortment
for a serial killer.

16:11.038 --> 16:14.274
Maybe targeted simply because
they were alone and vulnerable.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.209
Which would point even more

16:16.309 --> 16:18.711
to this vagrant Joe. I mean,
he's lived all over the island.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.280
He'd know about
the kapu area, too.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.848
We need to find him.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.216
Let's widen our net.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.685
Search for similar deaths
outside Hawai'i.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.055
You think this killer's
done it before?

16:28.155 --> 16:29.389
We need to find out.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.159
I'm on it, and
I'll get with Whistler,

16:32.259 --> 16:34.261
see if FBI's ViCAP
has anything.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.795
Or you can just ask Pike,

16:35.895 --> 16:37.297
since, evidently,
he's an "expert."

16:37.397 --> 16:38.731
I will stick with Whistler.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.601
So... how did last night go?

16:41.701 --> 16:44.537
Don't ever let your
kids grow up. Oh...

16:44.637 --> 16:46.706
New girlfriend that bad?

16:46.806 --> 16:49.576
There's nothing bad about her.
Cassandra's sweet.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.678
A little naive.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.546
She thinks she's got
the world figured out.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.548
Sounds like most teens.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.750
Except she's not a teen.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.388
She's 21.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.124
Really?

17:04.224 --> 17:05.725
Didn't think college girls

17:05.825 --> 17:07.660
wanted to date
guys in high school.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.264
Oh, not in college. She skipped
it, thinks it's overrated.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.600
Cass is more of a free spirit
who doesn't seem to have

17:13.700 --> 17:15.135
a care in the world.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.771
Well, I can see why
you hate her.
I don't.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.507
I just...

17:20.607 --> 17:22.175
I could already see
the influence

17:22.275 --> 17:23.276
that she has over Alex,

17:23.376 --> 17:24.611
and her life is a lot different

17:24.711 --> 17:26.246
than the one he's been planning.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.615
So, what are you gonna do?

17:28.715 --> 17:31.118
Still trying to figure that out.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.619
I mean, he is 18.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.986
Well, if Gracie was 18

17:34.087 --> 17:36.022
and started dating
some guy in his 20s,

17:36.123 --> 17:38.858
you can bet
I'd tell her how I felt.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.861
Would she listen?

17:43.029 --> 17:46.566
Being a bad guy sometimes
comes with the job, right?

17:50.203 --> 17:53.240
Oh, looks like park rangers
have eyes on Pike's suspect.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.774
I got to go.
All right.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.876
Keep me updated. Always.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.083
<i>So, this whole</i>

18:04.184 --> 18:06.319
ghost thing,
you really believe all that?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.721
I try to keep an open mind.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.057
I've seen a lot of weird things.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.161
Weird how?

18:14.261 --> 18:16.496
Like, "I don't really know how

18:16.596 --> 18:19.132
to explain what
just happened" weird.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.902
You have, too, haven't you?
No.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.037
Nothing I can remember. Oh.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.105
Oh, right, right.

18:26.206 --> 18:29.108
I mean, sure, maybe weird. Mm.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.179
Doesn't mean it was
a ghost or a spirit.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.113
Well, what happened?

18:36.048 --> 18:38.251
Nothing.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.153
Dude, you brought
this up. What...

18:40.253 --> 18:42.054
Clearly, you want to tell me.
What happened?

18:42.155 --> 18:45.158
I was just trying
to make conversation.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.162
All right, fine.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.664
There was this one time...
I knew it. What?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.933
We took a vacation
in the Smoky Mountains.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.736
Uh... whole family
went camping.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.940
Jake and I were out on
the trail, just the two of us.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.009
All of a sudden,
I turn around, and...

19:03.109 --> 19:04.076
he's gone.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.346
How old was he?

19:06.446 --> 19:08.181
Four.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.584
I yelled for him,

19:11.684 --> 19:14.521
looked... everywhere.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.190
I couldn't find him.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.627
That's scary.
The worst.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.795
For whatever reason, I-I started

19:22.895 --> 19:25.265
thinking about my grandfather.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.201
He died when I was, like, 15,

19:28.301 --> 19:30.770
but he taught me everything
about the woods,

19:30.870 --> 19:34.106
and I just closed my eyes

19:34.207 --> 19:36.142
and asked for help.

19:36.243 --> 19:39.379
But you got it?

19:39.479 --> 19:43.383
Yeah, when I opened my eyes,
I just kind of knew...

19:43.483 --> 19:45.518
the way to go.

19:46.653 --> 19:49.356
I found Jake five minutes later.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.091
Grandpa came through.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.229
I don't know, I mean,
probably instinct.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.530
Or maybe

19:57.630 --> 19:59.699
I heard something
in my subconscious.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.302
I don't know, something, but...

20:02.402 --> 20:06.038
Dude, which one of us
are you trying to convince?

20:07.307 --> 20:09.709
This is your
turn-off here.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.149
Whoa.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.818
I know, it smells
incredible, right?

20:18.918 --> 20:21.020
It's lemon and eucalyptus.
It's all-natural. You want some?

20:21.120 --> 20:22.722
No. I'm good.
Are you sure?

20:22.822 --> 20:24.524
Have you seen the bugs
in these woods?

20:24.624 --> 20:26.393
Joe's not the only killer
out there.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.194
Have you talk to the
rangers yet?
Yeah,

20:28.295 --> 20:29.796
they spotted Joe about
a half mile off the main trail,

20:29.896 --> 20:31.531
but they waited for us
to make a move.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.000
Did you make your
three wishes yet?

20:34.100 --> 20:36.569
No.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.105
Three wishes?
Yeah,

20:39.205 --> 20:42.241
because we had
fettu-genie Alfredo last night.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.744
It was just a little joke
we had working at dinner.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.946
Jess refused
to make any wishes.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.949
So, you had dinner at Jesse's?

20:50.049 --> 20:51.584
Yeah, Heather's
an amazing chef, man.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.553
Her Alfredo, <i>squisito.</i>

20:53.653 --> 20:55.087
Oh, yeah? Okay.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.490
Hey, maybe one day I'll get
invited, and I will find out.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.491
Squad goals, bro.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.792
Yeah.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.828
He wasn't exactly invited.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.397
Thanks for meeting us. Yeah.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.798
Special Agent Boone.
This is Holman.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.300
Hey.
How are you?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.502
Good. If you guys want
any chance of finding Joe,

21:09.602 --> 21:11.003
we need to hurry.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.172
Either of you had run-ins
with this guy before?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.974
Oh, sure. Yeah, most of us have
at one point or another.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.377
Joe's not all there.
Few screws loose.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.778
Dangerous?
Can be.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.313
Scares the hell
out of people.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.681
Yelling and
chasing them off.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.384
Yeah, that would totally fit
my profile.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.654
Profile?
He means description.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.389
Of our unsub.
Unsub?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.391
He means suspect. Based
on my extensive knowledge

21:31.491 --> 21:33.860
of serial killers,
we are looking for a white male,

21:33.960 --> 21:37.497
35 to 60, highly mobile
with anger issues.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.799
Huh. Sounds like Joe.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.769
Or every other
serial killer ever.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.071
How about we go find him?

21:45.171 --> 21:46.673
Hey, Neil.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.842
Exactly how long was this
serial killer seminar you took?

21:49.942 --> 21:51.544
Oh, it was
one weekend,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.780
but it was,
like, very intense.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.415
Very intense.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.222
At this clearing,
we might want to split up.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.757
Cover more ground.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.527
We'll follow your lead.
You know the area.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.095
You know, John Wayne Gacy

22:09.195 --> 22:11.364
buried his victims
under his own house.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.667
Yeah, Gacy was what we call
a hedonistic type killer.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.804
Wow.
You really know your stuff.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.772
Coast Guard handle
a lot of serial cases?

22:19.872 --> 22:22.041
Uh, I wouldn't say a lot...
Look out!

22:24.811 --> 22:27.246
Get the hell out of here!

22:28.515 --> 22:29.582
Everyone okay?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.684
Yeah. He's just
behind those trees.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.420
Put that weapon down, Joe.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.587
We're State Park Police.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.922
And federal agents.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.624
You want to lock me up.

22:37.724 --> 22:38.991
Joe, we just want to talk.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.627
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.462
Put that thing down,

22:42.562 --> 22:44.931
or we start
firing back.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.599
You wouldn't be
the first to try.

22:46.699 --> 22:50.770
Is that what happened
with the woman in Konahuanui?

22:52.572 --> 22:54.607
Was she trying to hurt you?

22:54.707 --> 22:56.743
You know about her?

22:56.843 --> 22:59.479
We know about the others, too.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.813
I didn't kill anyone,

23:00.913 --> 23:02.849
the <i>kupua</i> did.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.918
Like the mystical spirit?

23:06.018 --> 23:07.487
Told you he was nuts.

23:07.587 --> 23:10.423
I saw it with my own eyes.
Like a nightmare,

23:10.523 --> 23:11.491
head of a beast,

23:11.591 --> 23:13.793
eyes as red
as burning coals.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.295
Tusks. It's out here now.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.465
As in, presently?

23:18.565 --> 23:19.799
It's everywhere.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.233
Joe, we can help you.

23:21.768 --> 23:22.969
We can keep you safe.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.303
We just need you
to come out.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.905
Drop the bow, Joe!

23:26.005 --> 23:28.074
Don't shoot!

23:44.591 --> 23:46.158
Joe, stop.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.979
Where'd he go?

24:08.214 --> 24:09.381
Damn it.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.252
No, I don't know anything
about her roommates.

24:13.352 --> 24:14.754
Yeah, I know, but...

24:14.854 --> 24:16.589
That's what
I'm saying, Daniel,

24:16.689 --> 24:19.492
and Alex will accuse me
of not trusting him again.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.928
Hey, can we finish this later?

24:22.028 --> 24:24.396
Okay, I will. Bye. Come in.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.233
Alex problems?
Not a problem for him.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.935
He's dating a 21-year-old
and thinks

24:29.035 --> 24:31.437
she's lots smarter
than his parents.

24:31.538 --> 24:32.839
Ah, young love.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.507
I once dated a girl
who convinced me to move

24:34.607 --> 24:36.042
to a ranch in Argentina.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.945
Ernie Malik, gaucho.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.747
I'd pay good money to see that.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.414
Ah, lasted three weeks.
Wasn't my thing.

24:42.515 --> 24:45.552
Though I did learn I was
something of a llama whisperer.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.956
You-you think Alex is doing
this to antagonize you?

24:50.056 --> 24:52.091
No, not at all.
This isn't rebellion.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.359
So, maybe
give it some time.

24:53.459 --> 24:56.428
Young love is rarely
lasting love.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.498
Sitting back and doing nothing's
not my strong suit.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.633
Can't argue that.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.970
But you don't want to force Alex
to pick a side.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.138
Because I might not like
the side he picks?

25:07.874 --> 25:10.042
Okay, look, I...

25:10.142 --> 25:11.678
I'm assuming that
you didn't come up here

25:11.778 --> 25:12.879
to discuss
my son's love life.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.014
I saw Jesse
and Kai's report

25:15.114 --> 25:17.049
on the guy in the woods.
That <i>kupua</i> he described.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.051
Right, it sounded like
he was experiencing

25:19.151 --> 25:20.920
some delusional ideation,

25:21.020 --> 25:23.255
possibly schizophrenia
or bipolar disorder.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.692
Could be, but what if he's not?

25:25.792 --> 25:27.093
A <i>kupua</i>

25:27.193 --> 25:29.161
is a mystical being
in Hawaiian mythology

25:29.261 --> 25:31.731
that can take on
different bodies and shapes.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.500
And, what, you're saying
this one's real?

25:34.601 --> 25:35.802
University's
doing this big

25:35.902 --> 25:38.805
mammal migration study
in Konahuanui.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.272
They installed
motion-activated

25:40.372 --> 25:42.008
cameras all over that area.

25:42.108 --> 25:45.011
I got the footage from the night
Ella Baird went missing.

25:47.980 --> 25:48.881
What's that?

25:48.981 --> 25:50.382
Wait for it.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.760
Joe's <i>kupua.</i>
I mean,

26:00.860 --> 26:03.630
he might still be delusional.
That could be him.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.264
Or he's our only witness.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.565
Either way,
we need to find him

26:06.666 --> 26:08.467
again and hold
onto him this time.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.136
State Park Police
didn't know where his camp was.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.437
He could be anywhere.

26:11.537 --> 26:13.239
Then we're gonna need
some support.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.252
Let's take
another sweep.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.187
We'll come around
from the east side.

26:31.924 --> 26:32.859
Hold on,
what's that?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.160
Where?

26:34.260 --> 26:36.328
Through that clearing.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.635
Yeah, that could be him.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.204
I'll geomark the location
and have Kai meet us.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.306
All right, let's nest this bird.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.976
Can't you just say "land"?

26:56.415 --> 26:58.350
All right, we got to be careful.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.987
Even if Joe's not the killer,
he's dangerous.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.989
Best chance is to
take him quick.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.490
Pike, cover us. Yeah.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.835
He's not here.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.303
He must be close.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.971
Forest is huge.
I'm gonna call for backup.

27:19.071 --> 27:22.008
Guys. Guys.
I'll loop Tennant in.
Let her know that...

27:22.975 --> 27:25.144
We're not gonna need backup.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.361
So, these could all be
additional victims?

27:42.461 --> 27:43.863
Seems like it.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.832
All were reported missing,
like the ones here on island.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.533
If they're all connected...

27:47.633 --> 27:49.902
It means the killer's been
getting away with this

27:50.002 --> 27:51.537
even longer than we thought.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.306
These are the possibles
you found on ViCAP?

27:54.406 --> 27:55.641
Yeah, Whistler also talked to

27:55.742 --> 27:57.343
the experts at the
Behavioral Analysis Unit.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.311
Besides tracking down
known serial killers,

27:59.411 --> 28:00.780
they keep tabs on cases that

28:00.880 --> 28:02.949
might indicate an unidentified
killer at work.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.184
I'm surprised BAU
was willing to share.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.453
Well, I did ask nicely,

28:07.553 --> 28:09.255
and I promised you'd share back.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.589
Of course. I'm just glad that

28:10.689 --> 28:11.557
they didn't try
to take the case away.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.793
They did try.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.595
And you convinced them not to?

28:16.695 --> 28:18.898
Well, I may still be new
to the Bureau, but

28:18.998 --> 28:21.033
office politics are my jam.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.335
All right,
what do we have?

28:23.435 --> 28:26.172
Five cases of hikers who
went missing when out alone.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.841
All occurred anywhere
from five to ten years ago.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.543
Which would have been before
our earliest victim here.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.112
Right, the timeline fits.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.014
But no bodies were found,
so the Bureau wasn't even sure

28:35.114 --> 28:36.749
they could be classified
as homicides.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.450
Means the killer
stayed under the radar

28:38.550 --> 28:39.752
for over a decade.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.620
It has to be someone
knowledgeable about

28:41.720 --> 28:43.155
wilderness areas.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.590
We've cross-referenced

28:44.690 --> 28:46.458
guides, workers, volunteers,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.828
anyone who might have worked
in multiple locations

28:48.928 --> 28:50.196
where the victims disappeared.

28:50.296 --> 28:53.032
Including state
and federal park police?

28:53.132 --> 28:54.834
Checked the national database,

28:54.934 --> 28:56.969
but, so far, no one working
one of the older locations

28:57.069 --> 28:58.370
is here in Hawai'i.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.072
Unfortunately, all of these
are different

29:00.172 --> 29:02.108
jurisdictions, and a lot
of the records aren't digitized.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.976
Chase has something.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.311
Keep at it.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.886
Hey, Carla.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.387
Thanks for getting
on this so fast.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.524
Yeah, of course. We were able
to ID your victim.

29:18.624 --> 29:21.193
His prints
came back as...

29:21.293 --> 29:22.561
Joseph Hoffman.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.530
He was Army.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.998
In and out of treatment
for years

29:26.098 --> 29:29.101
after he was discharged.
Possibly found some peace

29:29.201 --> 29:31.070
in the forest.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.806
I hope so.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.175
What can you tell me
about his death?

29:36.275 --> 29:39.311
Abrasions on the hands and arms
indicate a scuffle

29:39.411 --> 29:41.848
before he died.
So, he fought his killer?

29:41.948 --> 29:45.051
Yes, and it wasn't
any angry spirit.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.519
I was finally able
to do a full lab workup.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.888
Mr. Hoffman
and the other victims

29:48.988 --> 29:50.622
were, indeed, scared to death,

29:50.722 --> 29:52.925
but they had help.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.794
Testing showed
he had extremely

29:55.895 --> 29:58.730
high levels of dihydroxyphenyl-
methylaminoethanol

29:58.831 --> 30:00.799
in his system.
That's a mouthful.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.235
Adrenaline,
a naturally-occurring hormone,

30:03.335 --> 30:04.736
which is why it didn't
show up as unusual

30:04.837 --> 30:06.272
in the tests
on the previous victims.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.274
How high a level?

30:08.374 --> 30:11.077
Oh, massive. As if it was
injected into his system.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.045
Not fatal by itself,
but resulting

30:13.145 --> 30:15.447
in rapid onset of hypertension
and tachycardia.

30:15.547 --> 30:19.418
Sending the body's fight-or-
flight response into overdrive.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.487
Could be why the killer
uses the mask--

30:21.587 --> 30:23.089
to terrify his victims.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.757
Accelerating their heart rates
to catastrophic levels.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.260
Their fear is his high.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.862
And this is why
I don't worry too much

30:29.962 --> 30:31.263
about restless spirits.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.733
The real-life monsters
are scary enough.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.608
What exactly are we
looking for here?

30:42.708 --> 30:44.676
Anything the killer
might've touched.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.612
If we can find DNA or a print,

30:46.712 --> 30:48.047
we may be able to identify him.

30:48.147 --> 30:51.117
I'll start processing
the area around the tent.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.020
Where's his bow and arrows?

30:54.120 --> 30:57.256
He would've kept those
close, right?

30:58.490 --> 30:59.591
That's a good point.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.627
Yeah, they're not here.

31:01.727 --> 31:02.828
Could mean the killer actually

31:02.929 --> 31:04.530
found him somewhere else
in the woods.

31:05.497 --> 31:08.200
And Joe ran and made it back
to his camp before he died.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.768
So, this might not be
the crime scene.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.738
Okay, why don't we split up,
search the area?

31:12.838 --> 31:14.206
Maybe we'll find it. Right.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.909
Let's split up
and go in different directions.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.745
That way, the killer can
pick us off one by one.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.749
I'm kidding.

31:23.849 --> 31:26.752
Please, we're federal agents
with guns.

31:26.852 --> 31:29.121
I'll take the high road.

31:29.221 --> 31:32.424
Try sitting through
a whole dinner with him.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.797
Do federal agents

31:38.897 --> 31:41.667
take a class on how to write
excruciatingly boring reports?

31:41.767 --> 31:43.902
For most of us,
it comes naturally.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.704
I'm not finding any connections

31:45.804 --> 31:47.206
between the victims.
Some of the same

31:47.306 --> 31:48.874
social media apps,
but none of the same friends.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.442
Nothing in their backgrounds,

31:50.542 --> 31:53.045
jobs... I'm sorry, am I
excruciatingly boring, too?

31:53.145 --> 31:54.446
Yeah.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.783
Oh, I mean, no. You're the
least boring person I know.

31:57.883 --> 31:59.485
Nice save.
Look at this.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.788
These are the physical copies
of the two oldest cases

32:02.888 --> 32:04.556
that the FBI
sent over.

32:04.656 --> 32:05.791
They were never digitized.

32:05.891 --> 32:07.126
Blasphemy.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.061
The first disappearance
was ten years ago

32:09.161 --> 32:11.097
in Utah. There's
a witness statement

32:11.197 --> 32:12.965
from a park maintenance worker

32:13.065 --> 32:14.933
who was the last person
to see the missing woman.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.835
Bryson Stone.
Mm-hmm.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.039
He was never a suspect,
but take a look

32:20.139 --> 32:22.441
at this case in Colorado
a year later.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.444
One of the employees
who was first on the scene

32:25.544 --> 32:26.778
was a park guide.

32:26.878 --> 32:30.116
B. Stone.
Think it's the same person?

32:31.450 --> 32:32.351
Let's find out.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.386
Changing jobs
would've made it

32:34.486 --> 32:36.722
harder to connect him
to all the disappearances.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.357
Here he is, Bryson Stone.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.893
What's he doing now?

32:41.994 --> 32:44.396
He's moved up the ladder
a few rungs.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.132
Stone's with the
State Park Police,

32:46.232 --> 32:48.000
right here
in Hawai'i.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.611
Kai.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.181
I think I found it.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.387
Oh, I got you.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.860
Kai, you got
an evidence bag?

33:14.960 --> 33:17.296
I'm gonna need
that back.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.941
I found his phone,
but no Pike.
He's gone, boss.

33:30.042 --> 33:32.211
We got no sign of him.
Should we put out a BOLO?

33:32.311 --> 33:33.979
Can't risk it.
Stone has a police radio

33:34.080 --> 33:35.681
with him.
He'll kill Pike right away

33:35.781 --> 33:36.848
if he figures
we're on to him.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.016
Hey, we're gonna
find him, okay?

33:38.117 --> 33:39.451
Any luck tracking Stone?

33:39.551 --> 33:40.619
No signal. He must've
turned his phone off.

33:40.719 --> 33:41.653
There's a thousand back roads

33:41.753 --> 33:42.688
through the parks on the island.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.223
Stone knows them all.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.924
He could be anywhere. Anything
from the State Park Police?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.859
They confirmed Stone's
vehicle has GPS.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.328
They're trying
to locate it.

33:49.428 --> 33:50.729
Yes, I'm here.
Give it to me.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.465
Jesse, Kai,
we might have something.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.467
Got him.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.803
He's in Konahuanui.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.605
Sending the
coordinates now.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.955
Not such a know-it-all now,
are you?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.424
Get away from me.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.792
Oh, we are just getting started.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.233
I'm gonna
cut you apart

34:27.333 --> 34:31.470
piece by piece.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.405
No.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.773
I know what you're doing.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.074
You're a thrill killer.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.876
You're process-focused
and organized.

34:37.976 --> 34:40.045
You want me
to feel helpless.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.448
What I want you to do

34:42.548 --> 34:44.783
is run!

35:07.839 --> 35:10.576
They're not here. Come on.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.222
Don't stop!

35:23.322 --> 35:25.224
You stop...

35:25.324 --> 35:26.925
you die.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.246
I warned you!

35:49.248 --> 35:50.216
Run!

35:56.355 --> 35:59.425
This is... what he wants.

35:59.525 --> 36:00.692
Come on, Neil.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.093
Get it together.

36:02.194 --> 36:05.931
You're a special agent
of the United States

36:06.031 --> 36:07.032
Coast Guard!

36:34.860 --> 36:36.295
It's okay, buddy, we got you.

36:36.395 --> 36:39.130
Deep breaths.
You got to calm down.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.336
Wait, wait.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.538
My profile...

36:46.638 --> 36:48.206
was so right.

36:51.643 --> 36:52.911
Come on.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.489
We just finished
at Bryson Stone's apartment.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.991
He was one twisted ranger.

37:06.091 --> 37:08.026
The mask and machete
kind of gave that away.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.996
It was basically
a serial killer smorgasbord.

37:11.096 --> 37:13.632
BDSM magazines,
disgusting videos.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.100
Ugh, I feel like
I need a shower.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.167
Ugh.

37:16.268 --> 37:17.936
Scary how long
he got away with it.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.005
Even scarier to think how much
longer he might've kept going.

37:20.105 --> 37:23.542
But do you notice how
it wasn't any "angry spirits"

37:23.642 --> 37:25.110
that took Stone down?

37:25.210 --> 37:27.346
I mean, it was just
good old-fashioned police work.

37:27.446 --> 37:28.847
Yeah, maybe, or...

37:28.947 --> 37:31.617
maybe they were pulling
some strings behind the scenes.

37:31.717 --> 37:32.818
Right.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.152
Hey, all I'm saying is,

37:34.252 --> 37:35.687
it doesn't hurt
to show some respect.

37:35.787 --> 37:36.922
Guess who just got a clean

37:37.022 --> 37:38.824
bill of health
from the doctor.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.593
Apparently, I have the heart
of a 20-year-old.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.362
Well, I'm glad you're okay. Thanks.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.532
Hey, um...

37:46.632 --> 37:48.800
I just want to say
thank you so much

37:48.900 --> 37:51.737
for being there
for me today, buddy.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.076
You, too, Kai.

37:58.176 --> 37:59.345
It's what we do.

37:59.445 --> 38:00.946
Hey, you up for a drink
to celebrate?

38:01.046 --> 38:02.414
Sure.
Hey, I'm in.

38:02.514 --> 38:05.384
Jesse?
No, not me. I got
to take a rain check.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.086
This is hysterical.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.956
Did Heather send you the meme
of the chihuahua with the wig?

38:11.056 --> 38:13.725
No, she knows I hate those. Wait...

38:13.825 --> 38:15.494
Why? Did she send it to you?
Yeah.

38:15.594 --> 38:18.096
This is even funnier than
the one she sent this morning.

38:19.731 --> 38:20.932
You're texting with my wife?

38:21.032 --> 38:22.368
Oh, yeah. She's actually

38:22.468 --> 38:24.970
gonna set me up with one
of her friends. Marcie?

38:25.070 --> 38:26.372
She sounds incredible.

38:26.472 --> 38:27.806
Ooh, that is

38:27.906 --> 38:30.175
so great. You two should
totally go on a double date.

38:30.275 --> 38:31.710
What? No...
Hey, if it goes well,

38:31.810 --> 38:33.379
maybe you could all
go away for, like,

38:33.479 --> 38:34.780
a whole weekend or something?

38:34.880 --> 38:38.216
Mm-hmm. So, tell me
all about this Marcie.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.186
So, she's into true crime, so
I've got a perfect icebreaker.

38:41.286 --> 38:43.722
Think those spirits
may not be too happy with you.

38:52.798 --> 38:56.234
No, you don't ever have
to worry about that.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.438
Okay, I am here for
any questions you may have.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.008
Yes.

39:03.108 --> 39:04.776
Okay.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.278
Again, I am so sorry
for your loss.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.780
Bye.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.382
You didn't even
make it to your car.

39:10.482 --> 39:13.351
Father of one of the victims
called me on my way out.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.023
Felt like he deserved
my full attention.

39:19.491 --> 39:22.127
Kind of glad that's your job
and not mine.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.163
You know, I think of it
as a privilege,

39:25.263 --> 39:27.365
speaking to the next of kin.

39:29.334 --> 39:31.537
Because it is
a constant reminder

39:31.637 --> 39:33.472
to appreciate what we have.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.742
Said like a true stoic.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.777
I'm not sure I consider
myself stoic.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.946
Oh, no,
it's-it's a good thing.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.280
So, why doesn't it
sound like it?

39:42.380 --> 39:46.084
Stoics have been
terribly misunderstood.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.953
Like me, back in middle school.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.621
They accept misfortune

39:49.721 --> 39:52.123
because it teaches you
not to take for granted

39:52.223 --> 39:53.792
all the good things
in your life.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.527
All right, well, see, that

39:55.627 --> 39:56.795
I can get on board with.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.263
See? Stoic.
Mm.

39:58.363 --> 39:59.998
Still not feeling
the word.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.867
They also believe that
going naked in the cold

40:01.967 --> 40:04.269
and starving oneself build
character, so...

40:04.369 --> 40:07.138
...not a perfect philosophy. Okay.

40:11.309 --> 40:12.911
Hey, tiger.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.013
Hey.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.648
Doing some homework?

40:16.748 --> 40:18.617
Nah, it's just
something Cass read.

40:18.717 --> 40:21.186
She thought
I might like it.

40:21.286 --> 40:24.523
Well, what do you
think about it?

40:24.623 --> 40:25.657
It's cool.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.359
Not very far
into it.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.196
So...

40:31.296 --> 40:33.465
So...?

40:33.565 --> 40:35.467
What do you think of her?

40:35.567 --> 40:38.136
Cassandra?
Mom.

40:38.236 --> 40:39.538
Right.

40:40.972 --> 40:43.675
I'll be honest,
her age threw me...

40:43.775 --> 40:45.276
It shouldn't matter. I'm 18.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.579
But...

40:47.679 --> 40:50.015
she clearly
makes you happy.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.853
And that's what
really matters.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.359
So, you like her?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.394
I do.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.430
Great, 'cause she's here.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.998
Now?
Mm-hmm.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.034
Her text says
she's bringing a surprise.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.169
Hey.
Hey, handsome.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.773
Hi, Jane. Hi.

41:14.873 --> 41:15.907
I hope you like cream puffs.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.943
I got a whole box
from Liliha.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.512
Who doesn't love
a good cream puff?
