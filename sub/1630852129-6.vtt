33:44.480 --> 33:49.986
- Um...Alex, I love
speaking with you.

33:50.069 --> 33:53.573
You are mature beyond your age.

33:53.656 --> 33:56.367
It's attractive.
It inspires me.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.954
Martin, we've had
two great dates.

34:00.037 --> 34:02.373
They've both been interrupted.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.792
There definitely
is a connection,

34:04.876 --> 34:07.962
and I think
you're incredibly handsome.

34:09.047 --> 34:13.676
Winston, you literally
came in yesterday,

34:13.760 --> 34:15.887
but you crack me up.

34:15.970 --> 34:18.056
You're funny as hell.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.349
And I like our conversations.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.810
You're not typically

34:22.894 --> 34:26.564
the type of guy
I usually go for.

34:26.647 --> 34:31.778
- Hina, I've been able to see
how we interact

34:31.861 --> 34:34.572
when it comes to conflict.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.365
We've kind of hit
a couple little humps

34:36.449 --> 34:38.826
in the last couple days,

34:38.910 --> 34:43.206
and just trying
to navigate that.

34:43.289 --> 34:46.250
Racquel, I feel like you and I

34:46.334 --> 34:49.295
immediately were able
to connect on so many things.

34:49.378 --> 34:51.839
We both love to, like,
goof off and laugh a lot,

34:51.923 --> 34:54.967
and we're in deep conversation
and then we both try to kinda

34:55.051 --> 34:57.261
find the way back to,
like, the funny again,

34:57.345 --> 35:00.264
so I really enjoy
that about you.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.017
Remi,

35:03.100 --> 35:05.228
you and I have definitely
communicated quite a bit

35:05.311 --> 35:07.188
at this point in time of,
like, where we're at,

35:07.271 --> 35:09.524
and it was great to connect
on our date

35:09.607 --> 35:11.859
and see a different side
of you.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.361
And I really admire

35:13.444 --> 35:15.571
that honesty that you give,
the honesty I give,

35:15.655 --> 35:18.366
and the way that you
receive that as well.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.284
- Thanks.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.744
- Brooke,

35:21.828 --> 35:24.539
I think
you're the perfect blend of

35:24.622 --> 35:27.583
poise and vulnerability.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.126
We're still learning things
about each other

35:29.210 --> 35:30.586
every time we talk,

35:30.670 --> 35:33.172
and it's a journey.

35:35.007 --> 35:38.386
Nicci, as we've gotten
to know each other,

35:38.469 --> 35:39.846
some of the conversations
that we've had,

35:39.929 --> 35:41.430
sometimes difficult things,

35:41.514 --> 35:43.349
and the way that
you've reacted has showed,

35:43.432 --> 35:45.560
I think, a lot of maturity.
- I think it's pretty evident

35:45.643 --> 35:47.770
everyone here can see
how I do feel about you.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.689
If I was able
to meet your family,

35:49.772 --> 35:52.316
it would be truly an honor.

35:53.192 --> 35:54.569
- Dylan,

35:54.652 --> 35:56.904
I think you're an awesome girl,

35:56.988 --> 36:00.283
and I think that
the connection was there

36:00.366 --> 36:02.076
for sure, like, right away.

36:02.159 --> 36:03.369
I'm very impressed by you.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.913
- I feel like every time
we've hung out

36:05.997 --> 36:09.125
and had a chance to talk,
I've enjoyed it a lot.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.002
I really hope I get more time.

36:12.753 --> 36:19.552
- The person that
I'm sending home tonight is...

36:19.635 --> 36:20.553
Alex.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.054
I don't think our connection

36:22.138 --> 36:23.931
can get to the level
of my other connections,

36:24.015 --> 36:25.308
even with more time.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.852
But I truly wish
the best for you.
