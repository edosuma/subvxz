00:33.083 --> 00:35.875
Attention, everyone.
We are opening our offices

00:35.875 --> 00:38.333
for a totally
unrestricted inspection.

00:38.333 --> 00:41.125
Therefore, each of you will
need to take home and hide...

00:41.125 --> 00:42.959
one of our many
illegal items.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.792
I hope ponies
are illegal!

00:45.792 --> 00:50.500
-First up, a life-size
Margaret Thatcher robot.
-Ooh, ooh! Sir! Sir! Over here!

00:50.500 --> 00:52.458
Sanders, she's all yours.

00:52.458 --> 00:53.875
-Yes!
-Oh, man!

00:57.083 --> 01:02.834
Europe was created by history,
America by philosophy.

01:02.834 --> 01:05.709
The mouth on this one.

01:05.709 --> 01:06.959
Whoo!

01:08.834 --> 01:11.667
Okay. Next, God's autograph.

01:13.542 --> 01:16.458
Protestants only.

01:16.458 --> 01:17.959
-Oh, geez.
-Oh!

01:17.959 --> 01:19.625
Enjoy.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.125
And a machine
that turns water
into cocaine.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.875
I'll just hang on to this.

01:26.375 --> 01:30.625
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go party my nose
clean off my face.

01:30.625 --> 01:31.917
Sort out the rest
yourselves.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.875
-Ooh!
-What's in that one?

01:34.875 --> 01:36.041
That's mine! I called it!

01:36.041 --> 01:37.625
No, it's not! It's mine!

01:39.625 --> 01:42.667
Oh, it's a disintegrator?
I thought it was
a penis enlarger.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.291
That almost went
horribly wrong!

01:48.792 --> 01:50.792
Ma... Madam...
Madam... Madam!

01:50.792 --> 01:53.250
Ma... Okay, I'll just
let you talk.

01:53.250 --> 01:57.083
Oh, you done? Okay, I will
repeat myself one more time.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.250
I was making my grandchildren
some of your French onion soup.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.959
I poured the contents
of the can into a saucepan...

02:02.959 --> 02:04.875
and out plops a human finger.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.959
Now, the stress of this
incident has given me
walking nightmares,

02:07.959 --> 02:11.250
street terrors, diabetes
and hysterical pregnancy.

02:11.250 --> 02:14.583
Now, I am going
to require a substantial
cash settlement...

02:14.583 --> 02:18.959
somewhere in the amount
of whatever one of those
Ionic Breeze machines costs.

02:18.959 --> 02:20.208
My address is... Huh?

02:21.500 --> 02:22.667
Do I have the finger?

02:23.583 --> 02:25.959
Uh... Damn!

02:25.959 --> 02:28.250
The Lipton woman
outfoxed me again!

02:28.250 --> 02:31.542
-Honey, look what I got.
-Oh, what is that stuff?

02:31.542 --> 02:35.041
It's C.I.A.-grade,
high-tech, highly illegal
surveillance equipment.

02:35.041 --> 02:37.959
Check it out.
It's so sensitive
you can hear a moth fart.

02:40.500 --> 02:44.125
Open a tiny window, moth!

02:44.125 --> 02:47.458
-How much fun
is this thing, huh?
-Very fun, Stan.

02:47.458 --> 02:50.333
But we really need to get going
to the Memaris' barbecue.

02:50.333 --> 02:54.625
Or... Or we could sit here in
our underpants, drink scotch
and listen to the barbecue!

02:54.625 --> 02:59.000
-I'm actually kind of hungry.
-You're right. It wouldn't
be fair to the neighbors.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.917
They love me!
I'll stop by
and make their week.

03:01.917 --> 03:05.583
Turn the chicken crap
they call their lives
into chicken salad...

03:05.583 --> 03:08.625
the good kind,
with grapes.

03:08.625 --> 03:12.208
Whoa, moth!
What the hell did you eat?
A poncho?

03:12.208 --> 03:15.417
Get it? 'Cause
Mexican clothes are like
Mexican food for moths.

03:15.417 --> 03:17.542
We really should
get over there.
I'm on fire.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.250
What else can I do?
What else can I d...
Oh! Oh, oh!

03:23.250 --> 03:25.333
I got it!
Finger in a Hot Pocket!

03:25.333 --> 03:27.583
Oh, wait.
Still need a finger.

03:27.583 --> 03:31.000
Look at Steve.
Living by the sweat
of his brow.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.625
Working hard
to earn an honest buck.

03:33.625 --> 03:36.291
What a douche.

03:36.291 --> 03:39.375
-Doing a bang-up job, son.
-Thank you, Mr. Hallworthy.

03:39.375 --> 03:42.458
I'm going to
a neighborhood party.
Not sure if I'm invited.

03:42.458 --> 03:46.500
All I know is I have
a casserole dish filled with
mousetraps, and I'm going.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.917
There, I've done it.
I'm an old man,
and I've said a crazy thing.

03:49.917 --> 03:53.333
Oh, my God! I have fallen!

03:53.333 --> 03:55.500
-Roger, are you okay?
-No!

03:55.500 --> 03:59.542
Yes. Play along.
I'm gonna squeeze this old coot
for some quick cash-ish.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.917
Ow! Ouchie! Ow!

04:01.917 --> 04:04.667
-What? What's going on?
-I'm Steve's cousin.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.417
I tripped on your walkway,
and I need compensation.

04:07.417 --> 04:09.875
I'll take a check,
and I'll need two forms of I.D.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.750
Passport's okay,
or a utility bill
with your current...

04:12.750 --> 04:15.041
You know what?
You're boring me.
Make it a thousand, cash.

04:16.542 --> 04:18.208
Roger, please
don't do this!

04:18.208 --> 04:20.625
Mr. Hallworthy's always
been very sweet to me.

04:20.625 --> 04:24.166
As sweet as owning
that PlayStation
you've been lusting after?

04:24.166 --> 04:26.083
Back me up
and I'll buy it for you.

04:26.083 --> 04:30.166
Steven, you're a trustworthy
young man. Is your cousin
on the up-and-up?

04:30.166 --> 04:34.125
Mr. Hallworthy,
I have to tell you
the truth.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.625
Lying is awesome!

04:38.041 --> 04:40.583
So just to show him
I'm not a hard-hearted man,

04:40.583 --> 04:44.083
I bought all his oranges,
I bought all his walnuts,
then I had him deported.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.750
Everyone knows
the juiciest fruit
is bought on the roadside.

04:52.333 --> 04:57.250
-Why, hello, Lisa.
-Stan, Francine, this is Jared,
my current lover.

04:57.250 --> 05:00.709
Mommy met Jared at Black Angus
while we waited in the car.

05:00.709 --> 05:03.625
Is that right?
Well, aren't you a little...

05:03.625 --> 05:05.959
Bam!

05:05.959 --> 05:08.792
Just kiddin', partner.
You know, sometimes
in life, you meet people who...

05:08.792 --> 05:10.291
Bam!

05:10.291 --> 05:12.458
Ah! I got you again!

05:12.458 --> 05:14.417
Deuce! Deuce!
Two times!

05:16.291 --> 05:18.458
Well, come along, kids.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.917
You can play house while
Jared and I fornicate on your
father's old weight bench.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.875
Quirky.

05:23.875 --> 05:26.417
-Oh, are people
heading home already?
-Afraid so, Bob.

05:26.417 --> 05:28.625
You see, I've got
a very busy... Bam!

05:28.625 --> 05:31.625
Dead kid! Mama's cryin' as she
takes your crayon drawings
off the fridge!

05:33.542 --> 05:35.959
Francine, that was
just what I needed.

05:35.959 --> 05:38.583
I'm surrounded
by neighbors
who love me.

05:38.583 --> 05:41.917
Beloved. I feel
I am beloved.

05:41.917 --> 05:44.041
Nurse, I'm ready for my bath.

05:44.041 --> 05:46.250
Who's there? Santa?

05:46.250 --> 05:50.458
That's Mr. Hallworthy.
I must have forgotten to turn
off my surveillance equipment.

05:50.458 --> 05:52.583
Did you enjoy
the barbecue, sir?

05:52.583 --> 05:55.959
Yes, except for Stan Smith's
interminable yammering.

05:55.959 --> 05:58.250
I thought his stories
would never end.

05:58.250 --> 06:02.166
But that's the surprise.
You think my stories won't end
but they do.

06:02.166 --> 06:05.125
How could he...
How could he say such things?

06:05.125 --> 06:07.041
Doesn't he know
everyone loves me?

06:07.041 --> 06:11.041
-Stan, maybe it's not right
to listen in on...
-Shh! I got the Memaris.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.583
Did you see Stan filling
his pockets with shrimp?

06:13.583 --> 06:15.917
I mean, what kind
of cheap bastard does that?

06:15.917 --> 06:18.625
Bob. No.

06:18.625 --> 06:21.166
Why does Stan
always show us his class ring?

06:21.166 --> 06:24.041
Because when
stupid people get nervous,
they talk about shiny things.

06:26.125 --> 06:28.625
But gay men
are never catty!

06:28.625 --> 06:30.709
What's happening here?
Somebody must like me!

06:30.709 --> 06:33.875
And what kind
of an idiot points
a loaded gun at a child?

06:33.875 --> 06:36.166
I made lemonade and fudge.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.917
I know, Johnny. But please,
Mommy's almost there.

06:38.917 --> 06:42.500
All Smith does is talk.
He doesn't know how to listen.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
-He's a pig-headed...
-No-neck...

06:44.500 --> 06:45.792
jackass!

06:45.792 --> 06:49.208
Ah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I'm not beloved!

06:49.208 --> 06:52.333
I'm hated!
I'm surrounded by people
who hate me!

06:52.333 --> 06:55.417
It's our wedding
all over again...
except I'm you!

07:01.208 --> 07:03.166
My God!
Everybody hates me!

07:03.166 --> 07:06.000
I feel like a Jew outside
of New York or Los Angeles!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.333
Hey, why don't we throw a party
of our own?

07:08.333 --> 07:10.750
You know, to show 'em
that they're wrong about you.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.792
That's a brilliant idea!
We should form a think tank!

07:13.792 --> 07:17.583
What with your ability to come
up with ideas and my ability
to assess their worth!

07:17.583 --> 07:20.875
-We should call it
Thoughts Unlimited.
-That's terrible.

07:23.500 --> 07:27.208
All right, Steve.
We are moments away from
getting a lifetime supply...

07:27.208 --> 07:29.208
of whatever the hell it is
they sell here.

07:29.208 --> 07:32.667
Awesome!
So here's what I think
we should do. You go--

07:32.667 --> 07:38.083
Ah-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!
You don't get paid to think.
You get paid to look honest.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.417
Cup of your
hottest coffee, please.

07:40.417 --> 07:43.166
Remember,
you're the Face.
I'm the Brain.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.375
Aw! This cup
is irresponsibly hot!

07:46.375 --> 07:48.542
Oh, my face!

07:51.750 --> 07:52.583
Exactly.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.792
Don't worry, buddy.
We'll get you fixed up.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.834
This wasn't
properly anchored.

08:28.959 --> 08:32.250
There. This should
show people
you're not cheap.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.959
I put out lobster, caviar
and a bowl of $10 bills.

08:35.959 --> 08:38.375
Nice work.
What kind of caviar?

08:38.375 --> 08:42.709
See? See what I did there?
I asked a follow-up question.
I'm listening.

08:42.709 --> 08:44.667
- Here they are.
- Wish me luck.

08:46.667 --> 08:49.875
Hello, everybody.
Please, come in and talk about
yourselves at length.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.375
- Ooh, shrimp!
- And caviar!

08:52.375 --> 08:54.750
Is there
a dip for the $10 bills?

08:54.750 --> 08:56.750
Johnny! Bam!

08:56.750 --> 09:00.125
Ah! It's an eclair...
Delicious, not deadly.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.083
Ah, we're havin' fun now.

09:02.083 --> 09:05.583
So, Lisa, who is this
handsome new piece
of arm candy?

09:05.583 --> 09:07.375
This is Bjorn,
my Norwegian lover.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.834
We hooked up at
the Arco while the kids
were pumping gas.

09:09.834 --> 09:12.917
How interesting
I find that!
Please continue.

09:12.917 --> 09:16.166
Well, I go inside,
and there's this gorgeous guy
buying a pretzel.

09:16.166 --> 09:19.875
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Now, you might notice
he smells like fish.

09:19.875 --> 09:23.583
-Well, that's because his
father owns a herring farm.
-Oh!

09:23.583 --> 09:26.959
People don't realize
there are over 300 types
of herring.

09:26.959 --> 09:31.125
The blue herring,
the light-blue herring,
the medium-blue herring,

09:31.125 --> 09:34.667
-which is really only
a juvenile light-blue herring.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.917
Well, thanks for the party.

09:36.917 --> 09:40.208
Thank you for the fascinating
story about the shoes you
couldn't decide between.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.208
-Let me know how it turns out.
-Thanks again.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.291
-Bye bye.
-Bye.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.041
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

09:45.041 --> 09:48.333
-I think you did it.
-I know I did it!

09:48.333 --> 09:51.500
I am a hit
of the neighborhood!
Our neighbors love me!

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
Stan Smith is...

09:53.500 --> 09:55.208
Still a complete jackass.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.208
Bob. No.

09:58.291 --> 10:00.333
He kept
asking about my shoes.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.125
I mean, come on.
I'm wearing other things.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.250
And the way
Stan stared at me
when I was talking.

10:06.250 --> 10:09.291
Like he'd never eaten
a lavender herring.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.500
Smith was so phony...

10:11.500 --> 10:13.875
-like my children's love.
-Turn it off!

10:13.875 --> 10:17.458
-Turn that thing off!
-Oh, Stan, who cares
what they think?

10:17.458 --> 10:19.875
I love you,
and that's all
that matters.

10:19.875 --> 10:23.583
To you maybe!
Francine, I will make
these people like me.

10:23.583 --> 10:27.417
As God is my witness,
I will be beloved.

10:27.417 --> 10:32.291
Attention, neighbors.
An important part of any
relationship is vulnerability.

10:32.291 --> 10:36.458
So I will now share with you
painful and embarrassing
chapters from my life.

10:36.458 --> 10:41.250
Age seven, I put my little
cousin's doll in a river
and watched it float away.

10:41.250 --> 10:45.583
When she cried, I called her
little Sally cry-pants.
I don't know why I did it.

10:45.583 --> 10:48.792
Age 11, When my parents
wouldn't let me have
a fourth cupcake,

10:48.792 --> 10:50.875
I burned down
their summer home.

10:50.875 --> 10:54.375
When caught, I framed
my favorite grandfather.
I don't know why I did it.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.500
Age 15, I put
a bunch of flies
in a blender.

10:57.500 --> 11:01.208
Attention, neighbors.
It's me again.

11:01.208 --> 11:03.417
I found a book
at Barnes & Noble
that says,

11:03.417 --> 11:08.000
"The path to true friendship
is paved with
selfless generosity."

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Accordingly,
I am now going to paint
all of your houses at once.

11:16.125 --> 11:19.750
That's lead-based paint.
Don't let your kids lick it!

11:23.375 --> 11:26.250
Hey, hey, hey, everybody.
It's your favorite neighbor!

11:26.250 --> 11:28.333
Oh, my God!
It's him.

11:28.333 --> 11:31.417
Hey, look at that
dangerous pool.

11:31.417 --> 11:35.166
Johnny!
Happy birthday, dude!

11:35.166 --> 11:39.542
-Are these rocks?
-Not just any rocks...
pocket rocks.

11:39.542 --> 11:41.959
You keep 'em in your pockets.
They only work in your pockets.

11:41.959 --> 11:45.417
That's how you know
you got pocket rocks.
Happy birthday!

11:45.417 --> 11:50.125
Oh, my God!
Johnny fell in the pool playing
with his new birthday present.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.834
Whoever saves him
will certainly be beloved.

11:52.834 --> 11:56.667
For he who is not afraid
to risk life and limb
for a neighbor in need...

11:56.667 --> 12:00.792
My baby!

12:00.792 --> 12:05.667
-Unhand that child,
underwater molester clown!
-You need to go.

12:08.667 --> 12:12.458
Hi. I have to sell my house,
because my neighbors
don't like me.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.417
Yes, that's the only reason.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.959
Well, I guess you and I
have different definitions
of "silly."

12:16.959 --> 12:18.709
Remind me never to go
to the circus with you,

12:18.709 --> 12:19.917
we'd have nothing
to talk about.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.667
Hey, where're
you guys goin'?

12:22.667 --> 12:26.000
Taking Maggie for
a long weekend
to the C.I.A. beach house.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.959
-The C.I.A.
has a beach house?
-We do now.

12:28.959 --> 12:32.875
Congress is letting the C.I.A.
seize any property that could
help us in the war on terror.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.458
And this is cool
with Bullock?

12:34.458 --> 12:36.834
Don't know. Nobody's
seen him for days.

12:36.834 --> 12:39.875
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
listen to me.

12:39.875 --> 12:43.291
Charlie, Charlie?
What's your name again?

12:43.291 --> 12:46.291
Wow!
So we can just seize
anybody's house we want?

12:47.208 --> 12:48.291
Hmm.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.709
Hey, what...
what are you doing?

13:06.709 --> 13:09.709
C.I.A. Your house
has been seized to help
in the war on terror.

13:09.709 --> 13:12.125
How is our house
gonna help
in the war on terror?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.500
That's classified,
but it's going
to help a lot.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.792
There should be
no more terror
at all very soon.

13:16.792 --> 13:21.333
You will each receive a coupon
good for a five-night stay
at the Cornfield Motel.

13:21.333 --> 13:26.959
The Cornfield Motel,
providing you all the comfort
and elegance of corn.

13:26.959 --> 13:30.208
Honey, good news.
The neighbors
no longer hate me.

13:30.208 --> 13:32.417
Because they're no longer
our neighbors.

13:32.417 --> 13:34.583
In other words,
there goes the neighborhood.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.709
Ordinarily, that would
have racist implications,

13:37.709 --> 13:39.500
but I've actually done
something far worse.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.125
You evicted
all our neighbors?

13:49.125 --> 13:51.417
It's their fault!
I tried to be nice!

13:51.417 --> 13:54.667
I bared my soul.
I painted their houses.
I drowned their kids.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.709
Dad, you can't
just uproot people
from their homes.

13:57.709 --> 14:00.000
She's right.
You're insane.
This man is insane.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.667
Oh, am I?
Would an insane man
try to drink you?

14:03.667 --> 14:06.834
Gross! Gross!

14:06.834 --> 14:09.250
-Stan, stop it!
-He called me crazy!

14:09.250 --> 14:11.625
Nobody criticizes me!
Nobody!

14:11.625 --> 14:16.000
Honey,
no one's criticizing you.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.417
-We're your family.
-Well, things can happen
to families too...

14:19.417 --> 14:20.417
bad things!

14:27.125 --> 14:29.166
No, no. I'm just locked
out. I don't know how
I got out here.

14:31.083 --> 14:33.208
Steve, go put on a tie.

14:33.208 --> 14:35.875
We're going to the Four Seasons
so you can drink kerosene
and puke on yourself.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.792
-Roger, I've got
an idea. We--
-Face, Face, Face.

14:39.792 --> 14:43.917
I know. I know
I'm not the Brain,
but just hear me out.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.583
Instead of me getting
my ass kicked in all
these nickel-and-dime cons,

14:47.583 --> 14:51.709
what do you say we go
for one big score
and then call it quits?

14:51.709 --> 14:55.500
If we can pull this off,
we'll each make 50 grand.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.667
Fifty grand?

14:57.667 --> 15:00.625
Face, that's catch-your-dream
money, that's what that is.
So what's the scam?

15:03.667 --> 15:06.792
You must be the Hannigans.
Maurice Barnes,
All-star Realty.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.333
You're gonna
love this house.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.375
Here you go. I'm also
a singer-songwriter.

15:10.375 --> 15:12.834
I'm playing a gig
at Sarah's Coffee House
next Thursday,

15:12.834 --> 15:16.417
plugging my new
self-released CD... real
soul-searching, heavy stuff.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.667
Buy the house,
don't buy the house...
You're comped either way.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.542
Don't let it influence
your decision.

15:20.542 --> 15:22.959
My mother killed herself
when I was 12. Track four.

15:22.959 --> 15:26.458
One of the paramedics molested
me on the way to the morgue.
It's all in the liner notes.

15:26.458 --> 15:31.375
Come in, come in, come in!
Now, I love these built-ins.
You don't see these anymore.

15:32.208 --> 15:33.834
And these are walls.

15:33.834 --> 15:36.542
You know when people say
"the walls are closing in
on them"?

15:36.542 --> 15:39.000
Well, this is what
they're referring to.
So, do we have a deal?

15:41.375 --> 15:44.000
Why is there
a half-eaten meal
on the table?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.041
It almost looks like
the occupants were...

15:46.041 --> 15:48.583
forcibly dragged
out in the middle of dinner.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.625
Oh, you can do the kitchen
however you want.

15:50.625 --> 15:52.917
Oh, look!
Another serious buyer.

15:52.917 --> 15:55.083
Hello, I'm another
serious buyer.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.750
But you're so young.
How could you possibly
afford this house?

15:57.750 --> 16:00.500
-Remember the kid
from Jerry Maguire?
-Yes.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.250
-Of course.
-Well, he pays me to call
hotels before his arrival...

16:04.250 --> 16:07.375
to ensure they have pillows
that can support
his massive head.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.250
I do quite well,
which is why
I'm prepared...

16:10.250 --> 16:14.041
to offer you $99,000
and not a penny more!

16:14.041 --> 16:17.208
Oh, yeah?
Let me see the cash.

16:17.208 --> 16:20.250
I don't need to see
the cash. Well, Hannigan,
what's it gonna be?

16:20.250 --> 16:24.000
You gonna offer me a 100K,
or you gonna let
Jonathan Lipnicki's bitch...

16:24.000 --> 16:26.041
make you look like a punk
in front of your hot wife?

16:27.166 --> 16:28.125
Well, are you?

16:32.875 --> 16:35.959
What are we gonna
do about Dad? He's
completely lost it.

16:35.959 --> 16:40.166
Shh! If he hears us,
he'll send us all
to the Cornfield Motel!

16:40.166 --> 16:43.625
Well, we have to do
something! We can't
keep living like this!

16:43.625 --> 16:47.083
Oh, mein Gott!
He has heard everything!

16:47.083 --> 16:51.834
You were criticizing me!
And if you criticize me
then you don't love me!

16:51.834 --> 16:55.959
And if you don't love me
then you must hate me...
just like the neighbors!

16:55.959 --> 16:58.000
Oh, no!

17:02.417 --> 17:05.000
Stan, you can't do this!

17:05.000 --> 17:08.500
Oh, good. Criticize
me more. That worked
well the first time.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.959
I am a rock.
I am an island.

17:10.959 --> 17:14.041
I am incontinent. Get it?
Sounds like continent.

17:19.792 --> 17:22.542
Ah. Ah.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.417
Geez, Frank.
It's called a breath mint.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.750
-Did that couple's
check clear?
-Yup.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.917
Fifty grand for you,
50 for me.

17:40.542 --> 17:44.709
You realize we can't speak
to one another for a long time.
Don't try to find me.

17:44.709 --> 17:48.500
But if I hear that you die
before me, I'll leave a rose
on your grave every year.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.667
Well, every five years.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.583
Once.

17:53.583 --> 17:54.709
I'll think of you.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.208
I won't.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.250
We are so pleased you
have chosen to purchase

18:15.250 --> 18:17.917
your own restaurant
in the Senor Toad's family.

18:17.917 --> 18:20.166
Ribbit!
It's like "ole."

18:20.166 --> 18:22.625
Anyways, here is your official
Senor Toad sombrero

18:22.625 --> 18:25.792
and your complimentary
fire extinguisher
that shoots tequila.

18:25.792 --> 18:29.625
-Is this... heaven?
-No, it's Mexico.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.208
That makes sense,
'cause it smells
like Mexico.

18:32.208 --> 18:35.250
Now all that remains
is your franchise fee
of $50,000.

18:35.250 --> 18:36.208
Of course.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.500
This is just a photocopy
of a 14-year-old boy's butt.

18:43.291 --> 18:44.792
What is the meaning
of this?

18:46.542 --> 18:49.000
Dear Roger.
You taught me well...

18:49.000 --> 18:51.125
perhaps a little too well.

18:51.125 --> 18:55.750
You told me that
everyone's either a sucker,
a crook or just plain greedy.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.208
I guess you were all three.

18:58.208 --> 19:01.166
As for you, old friend,
I think you'll like Mexico.

19:01.166 --> 19:04.458
It's a lot like America...
on Opposite Day.

19:04.458 --> 19:07.458
Adios, sucker.
The Brain.

19:07.458 --> 19:10.875
So, the Face
becomes the Brain.

19:10.875 --> 19:14.041
And the Brain is stuck
in Mexico without a penny.

19:14.041 --> 19:15.792
I must plan
my next move carefully.

19:25.709 --> 19:27.834
Ah, this is how
life should be.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.917
No one to criticize me.

19:30.917 --> 19:33.542
No one to disagree.
No one to...

19:35.583 --> 19:37.041
Help me!

20:00.083 --> 20:03.291
Johnny, you...
you saved my life.

20:03.291 --> 20:07.083
-I thought you hated me.
-What? Why would
you think that?

20:07.083 --> 20:11.000
I heard what you said about me.
I was eavesdropping.
I heard what everyone said.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.917
It was... uncomplimentary.

20:13.917 --> 20:17.750
Mr. Smith, people talk
smack about each other
all the time.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.083
-You're not the only one.
-I'm not?

20:20.083 --> 20:22.041
Come with me.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.542
I just ran
into Hallworthy
at the ice machine.

20:28.542 --> 20:33.333
He had food on his neck.
How long has that been there?

20:33.333 --> 20:36.000
That Linda Memari
is one hairy woman.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.333
I felt like Jane Goodall
just talking to her.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.291
Lisa Collins
is such a skank.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.834
Let's make a list
of people she
hasn't slept with.

20:42.834 --> 20:45.458
You, me.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.500
Let's go to dinner.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.041
Wow, Johnny.
You're right.

20:50.041 --> 20:53.458
Everyone hates everyone.
So I'm not despised.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.917
No more than anyone else.

20:56.458 --> 20:58.417
You know, you're
a real bright kid, Johnny.

20:58.417 --> 21:01.750
I gotta say, I've lived
in this neighborhood for
a long time, and... Bam!

21:01.750 --> 21:04.583
Dead kid in the cornfield!
Crows pecking out your eyes!

21:04.583 --> 21:07.834
-Mama can't find you
for weeks!
-You're an ass, Mr. Smith.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.458
And you're funny looking.

21:10.458 --> 21:11.709
We're pals.
