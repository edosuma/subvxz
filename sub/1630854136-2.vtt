to follow her to New York

24:29.555 --> 24:31.861

from having an abortion.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.472
Isn't that correct?

overwhelmed.

I was worried about her,

And yes, he used

very pro-life.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.441
He was venting.

- Simone, is Blake Carter
the man you saw that day?

31:23.185 --> 31:24.273
- Yep.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.189
- Thank you.

31:27.233 --> 31:28.930
The people rest, Your Honor.

31:30.584 --> 31:31.890
- Mr. Hollands, you're up.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.979
- The defense calls
Blake Carter to the stand.

31:38.200 --> 31:42.074
Mr. Carter, were you in the
park on the day in question?

31:42.117 --> 31:45.599
- Yes, my mother asked me
to track Becca down

31:45.642 --> 31:48.036
and talk some sense into her.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.472
She wasn't taking
my calls, either,

31:49.516 --> 31:51.474
but we shared the location
on the maps app

31:51.518 --> 31:52.823
on our phone for safety.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.435
- So you followed her
to the park?

31:55.478 --> 31:58.655
- When I found her, she was
really upset, crying hard,

31:58.699 --> 32:02.224
and that's when she confessed
to me what she had done.

32:02.268 --> 32:06.620
- So she had already
had the abortion?

32:06.663 --> 32:08.317
- I was too late.

32:08.361 --> 32:11.668
- Were you angry
with your sister?

32:11.712 --> 32:16.586
- I'd be lying if I said no,
but I couldn't stay mad.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.675
It was so heartbreaking.

32:18.719 --> 32:20.155
She felt terrible.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.984
She--she knew that
she'd made a huge mistake.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.768
- You didn't fight
with your sister?

32:24.812 --> 32:26.118
- No.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.858
- You didn't push her
off a bridge?

32:27.902 --> 32:30.774
- No, of course not.

32:30.818 --> 32:33.647
But I saw who did.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.605
- So there was someone else?

32:35.649 --> 32:37.042
- Yes.

32:37.085 --> 32:38.913
Becca started telling me
about how she tried

32:38.957 --> 32:40.480
to get out of going
to the clinic.

32:40.523 --> 32:44.788
She realized that she wanted
to keep that baby,

32:44.832 --> 32:45.920
but she said there was a woman

32:45.964 --> 32:47.313
who forced her
to go through with it.

32:47.356 --> 32:50.316
- Did she tell you
who this woman was?

32:50.359 --> 32:52.013
- Some activist
who had helped her.

32:52.057 --> 32:54.059
I couldn't really make
sense of it at the time.

32:54.102 --> 32:56.017
I was trying to get her
to calm down,

32:56.061 --> 32:57.671
you know, to explain it to me.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.065
And I thought, well, maybe a
cold drink of water might help.

33:00.108 --> 33:03.068
- So you went
to get her some water?

33:03.111 --> 33:05.113
- Yes, and I didn't
have any cash on me.

33:05.157 --> 33:07.376
So she gave me her purse,
but when I came back,

33:07.420 --> 33:08.725
there was this
other woman there,

33:08.769 --> 33:10.162
and they were arguing.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.033
- Now, was this the woman
who coerced Becca

33:12.077 --> 33:13.687
into getting the abortion?

33:13.730 --> 33:16.168
- I mean, Becca was yelling
at her, telling her how

33:16.211 --> 33:19.040
she was gonna go back
to Texas and report her,

33:19.084 --> 33:21.608
warn other people
about her organization.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.175
- So what did you do?

33:23.218 --> 33:27.353
- Well, I tried to run over
to intervene, but before--

33:27.396 --> 33:31.313
but before I got there,
that woman, she--

33:31.357 --> 33:33.533
she pushed Becca
over the railing.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.752
And then she started
screaming for help

33:35.796 --> 33:37.754
and--and pointing at me,
but like

33:37.798 --> 33:40.409
I was the one who had done it.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.063
And I could see how it looked.
I panicked.

33:42.107 --> 33:45.023
I--I took off.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.721
- Why didn't you tell
this story to the police?

33:47.764 --> 33:52.552
- I should have, but I
wanted justice for myself.

33:52.595 --> 33:57.774
That woman murdered
my sister and her unborn child.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.950
- No further questions.

34:06.305 --> 34:12.093
- You stated that you never
told the police what you claim

34:12.137 --> 34:15.096
you witnessed because,
as you put it,

34:15.140 --> 34:17.229
you wanted justice
for yourself.

34:17.272 --> 34:20.406
- Yes, but I was arrested
before I got the chance.

34:20.449 --> 34:21.450
- You didn't tell anyone else?

34:21.494 --> 34:23.017
Your parents
or a friend, maybe?

34:23.061 --> 34:24.192
- No.

34:24.236 --> 34:26.934

murder your sister,

34:26.977 --> 34:29.676

that someone--

34:32.244 --> 34:33.810

know the truth?

the lawyers got involved.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.466

to keep my mouth shut.

a huge mess of everything,

do what I was told.

that you attacked your sister?

of her prescription were?

34:54.962 --> 34:56.181
- No.

34:56.224 --> 34:58.139
- Once you had the purse,
isn't it true that

34:58.183 --> 35:01.316
you pushed her out of anger,
out of spite?

35:01.360 --> 35:02.752
- No, I only wanted
to protect her.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.494

a slut, a murderer?
