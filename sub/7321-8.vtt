00:05.572 --> 00:08.234
<i>It's intense,</i>
<i>what happens in the OR...</i>

00:08.942 --> 00:10.967
<i>...when lives are on the line</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:13.912
<i>and you're poking at brains</i>
<i>like they're Silly Putty.</i>

00:18.218 --> 00:21.187
<i>You form a bond</i>
<i>with the surgeons right next to you.</i>

00:23.289 --> 00:26.258
<i>An unbreakable, indescribable bond.</i>

00:27.961 --> 00:30.361
<i>It's intimate,</i>
<i>being tied together like that.</i>

00:30.397 --> 00:32.421
You up?

00:32.465 --> 00:33.659
- No.
- Yes.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.329
<i>Whether you like it or not, whether</i>
<i>you like them or not, you become family.</i>

00:37.370 --> 00:42.137
- The Wicked Witch is dead.
- Metaphorically dead, or dead dead?

00:42.175 --> 00:45.474
- Who are we talking about?
- Hahn.

00:45.512 --> 00:49.073
Her name is off the surgical board.
Her surgeries have been canceled.

00:49.115 --> 00:52.482
I don't know how or why,
but I do know Hahn is gone.

00:52.519 --> 00:54.885
It's too bad. She was really talented.

00:57.924 --> 00:59.915
- You're not talking to me.
- Mm-mmm.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.395
- Hi. Is Grey home?
- Hi.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.234
Yes.

01:15.275 --> 01:18.039
Death! Come on,
where are you, Death?

01:19.079 --> 01:21.377
- Death!
- Die!

01:21.414 --> 01:23.905
- Oh, my God, it's been...
- Forever.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.749
- You look like...
- You look like...

01:26.786 --> 01:28.048
Death!

01:28.788 --> 01:32.053
Is the guy in the pajamas your
boyfriend? 'Cause if so, then hot.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.787
- Right?
- Hey.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.328
- Uh... Who are you?
- I'm Sadie. Who are you?

01:37.363 --> 01:39.388
I'm Cristina.

01:41.734 --> 01:42.826
Wow.

01:45.472 --> 01:49.340
Apparently they went
backpacking around Europe or something.

01:49.375 --> 01:52.742
Before med school. That woman
all but kicked me out of the bed.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.610
That's terrible.

01:54.647 --> 01:57.741
And Death? Meredith's name
is not Death, it's Mer.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.149
I really feel for you.

02:00.386 --> 02:03.947
She's never even mentioned this woman.
How good of a friend can she be?

02:03.990 --> 02:06.288
Good enough to kick us both out of bed.

02:08.193 --> 02:09.821
Welcome to my world.

02:16.402 --> 02:19.838
This woman is the reason I went
to med school in the first place.

02:19.873 --> 02:23.934
I figured if a slacker like Death could
handle slicing people open, I could too.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.140
- Meredith's not a slacker.
- I could tell you some stories.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.204
But you won't.

02:28.248 --> 02:31.342
Sadie, you postponed your residency
to work in a morgue?

02:31.384 --> 02:33.909
Yeah. All the fun cutting,
none of the rules.

02:33.953 --> 02:37.116
But I got bored, started
craving blood that was flowing.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.717
And now you're here.
I can't believe you're here.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.249
Yay.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.321
Iz, you coming?

02:44.364 --> 02:46.662
- Yeah. I just need a minute.
- I get it.

02:46.699 --> 02:50.863
Hahn's case brought up the Denny thing,
but Hahn's not even here anymore.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.134
It's stuff from the past.

02:53.973 --> 02:55.338
Stuff from the past, Iz.

02:56.976 --> 03:00.878
- You don't understand.
- I might, if you talk to me.

03:03.383 --> 03:04.748
Fine.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.416
See you inside.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.425
- I'm walking.
- Good morning.

03:19.465 --> 03:22.901
- Walking straight ahead, all by myself.
- You look good.

03:22.936 --> 03:26.872
Tired, but good. Did I mention
I find the short hair kind of sassy?

03:26.906 --> 03:30.171
Now I'm turning this corner.
Again, all alone.

03:33.446 --> 03:37.246
Ow! Um...

03:38.318 --> 03:42.220
These are scratches from my kitten.
He's a crazy scratchy scratcher.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.516
- You're a cat person?
- I meant hairbrush.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.992
I have a crazy scratchy hairbrush.

03:48.027 --> 03:52.123
Solo surgeries are at stake here, Three.
I can't have you acting weird.

03:52.165 --> 03:55.965
- Or wounded.
- I'm on top of my game, really.

03:56.002 --> 03:59.267
I'm sending you to Plastics,
far, far away. Just go.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.233
What do you know about
a heart guy named Dixon?

04:05.278 --> 04:08.441
Dixon? No, not a guy.
I've heard of Virginia Dixon.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.416
Got an incredible record,
really low mortality...

04:11.451 --> 04:13.783
- Wait, is she coming here?
- Yeah, today.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.482
Piggyback heart transplant.
I'm on the case.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.956
What? Why am I not on the case?

04:21.827 --> 04:23.955
So she's your pre-Cristina Cristina?

04:23.997 --> 04:26.261
You're gonna tell me
why she calls you Death?

04:26.299 --> 04:29.132
The adventures of Death and Die
are better left untold.

04:29.168 --> 04:31.159
Pedia's julienning her little arms.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.196
No word on what made H hitch
a ride with the flying monkeys.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.107
- Translate that for me.
- Lexie may be a secret cutter.

04:37.143 --> 04:40.010
- Still no word on why Hahn quit.
- That true about Lexie?

04:40.046 --> 04:41.980
- I don't know.
- What are you gonna do?

04:42.015 --> 04:44.074
- Nothing.
- You can't do nothing.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.948
- She's your sister.
- And?

04:45.985 --> 04:48.453
- And your family.
- I'm not understanding.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.615
Lexie's your family.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.318
Forget it.

05:01.367 --> 05:04.131
- Hello, Dr. Hunt.
- Dr. Yang.

05:04.904 --> 05:05.996
Thank you.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.871
- What do we got?
- Crush injuries.

05:09.909 --> 05:13.140
- Couple minutes out.
- What do you know about Hahn?

05:13.179 --> 05:15.807
- She's gone.
- Yeah, but why?

05:15.848 --> 05:17.042
I don't know.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.847
- You two are friends.
- I don't want to talk about it.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.854
I want blood and guts and mangled bones.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.152
I want a guy so smashed up
it takes all day to fix.

05:24.190 --> 05:28.126
I want to rock a surgery.
I don't want to talk about Hahn.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.323
Unidentified man
with prolonged extrication time.

05:34.367 --> 05:38.235
Had to fish him out of a garbage truck.
Multiple crush injuries,

05:38.271 --> 05:40.831
open fractures, GCS three,
couldn't unhook him.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.171
- Unhook him?
- His femur's broken in half

05:43.209 --> 05:45.973
and is puncturing his torso.
He's impaled.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.441
- Impaled on himself?
- Human pretzel.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.447
That'll do.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.295
- Wow.
- Check his popliteal pulse.

06:05.331 --> 06:08.061
- I'm getting nothing.
- 'Cause his knee's over here.

06:08.101 --> 06:11.366
Sleeping in the Dumpster
and they started crushing the trash?

06:11.404 --> 06:14.032
- That's a bad day.
- I'm here. What did I miss?

06:14.073 --> 06:16.041
Your first day. Stand back and shut up.

06:16.075 --> 06:19.272
Breath sounds are clear and equal.
Both sides. Unbelievable.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.509
No punctured lung. We need
a portable X-ray and an ultrasound.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.572
Someone page us?

06:23.616 --> 06:25.607
- I did.
- You did? That's a first.

06:25.651 --> 06:29.314
So's this. I've seen guys cut in half,
amputations, eviscerations,

06:29.355 --> 06:31.482
but I've never seen anything like this.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.085
I wondered if you could help.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.364
You hire when you're number one,
not number 12.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.094
But I need you to be
my ambassador today.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.830
Show Dr. Dixon what
Seattle Grace is all about.

06:43.870 --> 06:48.034
I've thrown a lot of money, big title
and a lot of research dollars at her,

06:48.074 --> 06:50.736
- but...
- But what?

06:53.079 --> 06:56.071
She's a little different.
She's a little off.

06:56.115 --> 06:59.380
- So we're wooing today, Bailey.
- I can woo with the best of 'em.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.616
- So, what, Dixon's a nutjob?
- Excuse me?

07:02.655 --> 07:05.089
I've already had my quota
of crazy for the year.

07:05.124 --> 07:08.821
I've had my off days. Wanna judge me?
You never even met the woman.

07:08.861 --> 07:12.763
Now you heard the chief, our job
is to impress Dr. Dixon today,

07:12.799 --> 07:15.597
- so be impressive.
- I've got the chart for Dr. Dixon.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.466
I'm ready to work. I'm excited.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.903
- Don't be. She's off.
- Karev.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.469
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.139
Heads up. Here she comes.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.546
Dr. Dixon. Hi.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.487
Welcome to Seattle Grace.
We're very happy to have you here.

07:37.523 --> 07:40.617
- I'm Dr. Bailey.
- I brought my own lab coat.

07:40.660 --> 07:44.357
I'm here to perform a
heart transplant today. I do hearts.

07:44.397 --> 07:48.766
A procedure invented by Christiaan
Barnard in 1967. I do hearts.

07:51.237 --> 07:54.172
Uh... I'm Dr. Webber.
We spoke on the phone.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.641
Karev, get Dr. Dixon the latest labs.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.042
Stevens, let's prep the patient, please.

08:05.952 --> 08:08.113
OK, then, she's a little off.

08:09.622 --> 08:12.921
His femur's in pieces.
Except the part stuck in his torso.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.324
No way I'm saving that leg.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.658
Impaled piece
is lodged under his clavicle.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.494
C- spine looks clear.
Without a CT, hard to be sure.

08:19.532 --> 08:22.831
- Why can't we get a CT scan?
- Way he's impaled, no clear reading.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.530
A stupid question.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.733
A limited window.
With vitals like these in a few hours...

08:27.773 --> 08:29.638
Won't be able to withstand surgery.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.700
Good thing he's unconscious.

08:31.744 --> 08:34.804
We can't do anything till we dislodge
the femur from his clavicle.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.908
Let's un-impale him. Yang, Grey,
new kid, hold his shoulders. Brace hard.

08:38.951 --> 08:41.044
- I'll hold his C-spine.
- I got his torso.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.317
I need to guide
posterior hip dislocation.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.723
Second that leg is out be ready
to assert pressure, stop bleeding.

08:46.759 --> 08:50.251
- Better than working on corpses, huh?
- On the count of three.

08:50.296 --> 08:53.493
One... two...

08:54.267 --> 08:56.292
Three!

08:58.304 --> 09:00.465
Femur's really wedged in...

09:01.374 --> 09:03.740
OK, almost there. Steady.

09:03.776 --> 09:07.610
Just a little bit further. Sloan, I need
you to rotate his knee to my right...

09:09.815 --> 09:12.613
- Push ten of morphine now!
- Stop! Stop!

09:20.726 --> 09:22.717
Corpses don't do that.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.939
- I need you to calm down, sir.
- What are you doing to me?

09:35.975 --> 09:37.408
Can you tell us your name?

09:37.443 --> 09:40.469
Get out of my face and your
hands off! You're hurting me!

09:40.513 --> 09:42.606
Do as he says. Hands off, everybody.

09:42.648 --> 09:43.808
Hands off!

09:47.353 --> 09:48.786
Thank you.

09:49.889 --> 09:53.154
- What's your name?
- Timothy Miller.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.752
Mr. Miller, we need
to get you into surgery.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.956
I'm gonna be able to walk, right?

09:57.997 --> 09:59.862
We're trying to keep you alive.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.201
Our cardiac wing is extensive

10:07.239 --> 10:09.070
and well-equipped with all...

10:09.108 --> 10:13.408
The first successful heart transplant
was performed on September 7, 1896,

10:13.446 --> 10:16.279
by Dr. Ludwig Rehn, Frankfurt, Germany.

10:16.315 --> 10:17.680
OK.

10:17.717 --> 10:21.949
- Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt.
- Please... I mean, just...

10:21.988 --> 10:24.650
Please update Dr. Dixon on the patient.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.853
Dr. Stevens is prepping your
transplant patient for surgery.

10:27.893 --> 10:31.693
They scheduled a transplant six years
ago, but the heart was too small.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.666
They added a donor heart
to help his own heart function.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.567
- They did a piggyback...
- Heterotopic transplant.

10:38.537 --> 10:42.200
Piggyback is the colloquial name
for the procedure. Don't do that.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.905
Don't do that.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.645
How about we take you
to meet the patient?

10:53.252 --> 10:57.780
They told me my heart belonged to a girl
hit by a car while she was hitchhiking.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.986
And now when I'm driving,
I see hitchhikers all the time.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.588
Always up ahead, just up ahead.
When I get up ahead they're gone.

11:04.630 --> 11:08.327
- You're not buying this, are you?
- I should never have gotten the heart.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.393
- I don't understand...
- Navajos, we don't touch the dead,

11:11.437 --> 11:14.998
don't touch their bodies or belongings,
the spirit clings there.

11:15.041 --> 11:18.374
So to have part of a dead body
sewed into my chest is...

11:20.780 --> 11:24.546
My friends, who follow the old ways,
they begged me not to do it.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.313
- I should've listened.
- Sorry, I don't understand.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.254
You think you're haunted by
your transplanted heart, but

11:30.289 --> 11:32.018
you're here for a new transplant.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.822
No! That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I don't want it!

11:34.860 --> 11:37.920
I don't want the new one.
I want you to take the old one out.

11:37.963 --> 11:41.899
OK, that's just plain stupid. Take the
heart, man. Take it if they offer it.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.562
Did he just say he doesn't want
the donor heart?

11:44.603 --> 11:47.231
- Yes, ma'am.
- Clay Bedonie, are you aware

11:47.273 --> 11:50.572
without a new heart you'll live
a short life attached to a machine

11:50.609 --> 11:52.907
before dying a sudden
and agonizing death?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.778
See, that's what I'm talking about.

11:59.819 --> 12:02.788
Five parallel pulley stitches
per cut, then switch.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.983
- Are you sure I'm numb?
- Toughen up.

12:05.024 --> 12:08.255
When one of our residents
gets picked for the solo surgery,

12:08.294 --> 12:11.786
one of us gets to scrub in. We have
a goal here. Focus on the goal.

12:11.831 --> 12:15.699
Solo surgeries, totally worth it.
Solo surgeries, totally worth it.

12:17.336 --> 12:21.705
Hello. I need someone to run these labs
and pull these X-rays, please.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.106
Will do.

12:23.609 --> 12:27.545
Hey, this looks like a cool place
to hang out. What are you guys doing?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.447
This is for interns, it's our hangout.
Go find your own.

12:32.852 --> 12:34.217
Sorry.

12:37.556 --> 12:41.287
Solo surgeries.
Totally worth it.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.426
I won't live if I can't walk.

12:44.463 --> 12:47.489
- We'll do our best to save the leg.
- I'm homeless.

12:48.801 --> 12:52.567
Walking is how I survive, it's how
I get from one day to the next.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.903
Marion Street's safe
from 2:00 to 6:00am,

12:54.940 --> 12:57.374
and then I go over to Hadley Bridge

12:57.409 --> 13:00.242
and I hang there till 6:30
until the traffic hits.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.908
And then I go over to Belltown,
and I hang out over at the waterfront.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.851
And then the waterfront, if it's
trouble, then I go back to 4th Street.

13:07.887 --> 13:11.516
I'm homeless. I can't not walk!

13:11.557 --> 13:15.254
I... What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

13:15.294 --> 13:16.989
Your injuries are critical.

13:17.029 --> 13:20.931
- If we don't get you to surgery...
- Will your surgery make me walk?

13:21.867 --> 13:22.959
Huh?

13:25.738 --> 13:27.262
Then I don't want it!

13:29.375 --> 13:30.399
OK. All right.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.171
You heard the man. The surgery's off.

13:42.721 --> 13:47.351
I appreciate you trying to advise me
to do what you think is best.

13:47.393 --> 13:50.226
- These are facts, not opinions.
- What I'm saying is...

13:50.262 --> 13:53.527
He's trying to say he would
rather live a shorter life unhaunted

13:53.566 --> 13:55.591
than a longer one that is.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.703
I'm not saying I agree, I'm just...

14:03.342 --> 14:05.173
I'm just gonna stand over here.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.206
That was a good idea.

14:08.247 --> 14:11.580
The heart that you take out of me,
what happens to it?

14:11.617 --> 14:14.381
It goes from the OR to pathology
to medical waste.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.980
I need that heart back, for a ritual.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.923
We have laws. There are rules.
Rules are rules.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.792
Maybe there's a compromise
to be made here.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.853
We could, I don't know,

14:24.897 --> 14:28.162
give him back the old heart
to do the ritual,

14:28.200 --> 14:32.660
then give him a chance to live
by still putting the new heart in.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.729
- No.
- No.

14:33.772 --> 14:37.333
- It doesn't work that way.
- I would still be haunted.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.003
Just by a new ghost.

14:39.044 --> 14:43.071
There are rules. We have laws
and rules are rules and laws are laws.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.406
No.

14:56.195 --> 14:59.187
So that's it? No surgery,
you're just gonna walk away.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.222
I'm respecting the patient's wishes.

15:01.267 --> 15:04.395
- Patient's unstable with an open wound.
- Which we are packing.

15:04.436 --> 15:07.132
- This guy's circling the drain.
- You cannot walk away.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.469
Don't tell me
how to run things in my ER.

15:08.507 --> 15:09.531
Your ER?

15:09.575 --> 15:13.705
We save lives here. We don't just
patch up patients and leave them to die.

15:15.881 --> 15:18.714
If you can't handle that,
go back to the desert

15:18.751 --> 15:21.720
and leave us here to do our jobs.

15:29.194 --> 15:31.788
Dr. Torres, please tell me...

15:31.830 --> 15:35.197
...you could figure out some way
to build this man some legs.

15:43.542 --> 15:46.773
The right femur's toast.
So's the hip and half the pelvis,

15:46.812 --> 15:51.112
but if I put some pins here,
and maybe a plate here...

15:51.150 --> 15:53.482
I mean, there are some viable
bone fragments.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.885
Not starting from nothing.
What do you think?

15:55.921 --> 15:58.355
- I think it's wild.
- She wasn't talking to you.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.985
- It's her first day. Could you not...
- She needs to learn her place.

16:02.027 --> 16:05.463
I think it's a lot of hardware. What
the guy needs is a whole new leg.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.659
Maybe I can do that.
Yeah, it's kind of a puzzle.

16:11.236 --> 16:15.002
I just need to figure out what equipment
I need and how to pull it off.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.032
- Like Lincoln Logs.
- A little more high-tech than that.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.840
It's exactly like Lincoln Logs.

16:19.878 --> 16:22.779
I need you guys to grab
every piece of titanium we've got.

16:23.382 --> 16:24.542
OK.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.186
I need the hospital rules
to specify the fact

16:30.222 --> 16:34.591
that we must respect all religious
and spiritual beliefs of our patients.

16:34.626 --> 16:38.528
- The rules?
- I'm asking you to declare a rule

16:38.564 --> 16:39.997
of our department.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.466
That we respect
the beliefs of our patients?

16:42.501 --> 16:44.992
- Yes.
- Isn't that just common courtesy?

16:45.037 --> 16:48.097
- Yes.
- Then why am I declaring it?

16:48.941 --> 16:49.999
Um...

16:50.042 --> 16:55.605
Dr. Dixon doesn't do common
courtesy, but she understands rules.

16:55.647 --> 17:00.016
So if it's a rule, we're golden.
If not, we have a pissed off patient,

17:00.052 --> 17:01.451
an apoplectic surgeon,

17:01.487 --> 17:06.049
and none of those things makes for a
successful procedure on a faulty heart.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.819
Not to mention the failure to woo.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.823
You want me to announce it as a rule?

17:13.866 --> 17:16.561
I'm here as a witness.
You can raise your right hand,

17:16.602 --> 17:19.400
put your left one on
the <i>Physicians' Desk Reference.</i>

17:21.406 --> 17:23.840
- It's a rule.
- Thank you.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.745
Dr. Dixon? I'm Cristina Yang.
I'm a resident.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.376
Been focused on cardio
since I began my internship.

17:32.418 --> 17:36.718
- I'm certainly looking forward to...
- Were the other ones taken off my case?

17:38.157 --> 17:40.648
- What other ones?
- The black one, the male one,

17:40.692 --> 17:42.523
the one with yellow hair.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.894
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Then why are you talking to me?

17:59.845 --> 18:04.339
What happened to Hahn? Whatever
made Hahn leave it can be fixed.

18:06.051 --> 18:08.417
Unless she was...
She wasn't fired, was she?

18:08.454 --> 18:10.513
- Not coming back.
- You don't know that.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.353
- She kind of does.
- How?

18:12.391 --> 18:14.359
Because she doesn't...

18:15.194 --> 18:16.752
Look, it's just too...

18:19.698 --> 18:21.256
We had a fight.

18:21.300 --> 18:25.202
Oh, please. Meredith and I fight
all the time. We still work together.

18:25.237 --> 18:28.206
It's not like Hahn
was your girlfriend or something.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.776
Oh, my God. She was your girlfriend?

18:38.817 --> 18:41.843
We hadn't... figured it all out.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.591
- So are you a lesbian now?
- I don't know.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.823
Maybe you were a "oncebian?"

18:50.896 --> 18:54.229
Or a "twicebian."
Whatever. It's over.

18:55.834 --> 18:58.860
- Are you OK?
- She's fine. Leave her alone.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.535
I hit the titanium mother lode.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.204
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.642
Oh, come on, really?

19:14.253 --> 19:16.619
Hey, Lexie. How are you?

19:16.655 --> 19:19.818
- Is everything going OK?
- Did somebody say something?

19:19.858 --> 19:23.453
- I was doing something?
- No, I'm asking as a person

19:23.495 --> 19:26.760
who's sort of related to you
if there's anything bothering you.

19:26.798 --> 19:30.427
This is not as a boss or resident or
superior who keeps an eye on what I do?

19:30.469 --> 19:33.199
No, I'm a compassionate person.
I'm just wondering

19:33.238 --> 19:36.639
if you're channeling your tragic pain
into self-mutilation.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.803
- Are you a secret cutter?
- No!

19:40.846 --> 19:43.371
Little Grey, Torres is trying
to set a world record

19:43.415 --> 19:46.907
for most titanium rods
used in one patient. You in?

19:46.952 --> 19:50.080
- Little Grey?
- Little Grey, Big Grey.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.420
It's how I tell you two apart.

19:52.457 --> 19:54.618
Yeah, I'm in. I'll just be a minute.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.458
Can't you people
let a guy die in peace?

20:04.503 --> 20:06.801
Your vitals are slipping.

20:06.838 --> 20:09.136
I'm not gonna lie to you,
that's not good.

20:09.174 --> 20:13.543
- I've been through worse.
- Yeah. I imagine you have.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.879
Oh... Don't get like that.

20:16.915 --> 20:21.147
Don't look at me
like I'm some tragic hero...

20:21.186 --> 20:23.051
...with a secret past.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.851
You have a story.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.255
We all have a story.

20:29.595 --> 20:34.828
I took a turn, with my life,
and I couldn't connect.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.035
I lost.

20:40.939 --> 20:42.964
I couldn't connect.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.841
My life, it took a turn and...

20:52.884 --> 20:55.284
I just couldn't turn it back.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.591
Guys, we need to shut down
for a few days.

21:04.630 --> 21:08.464
People are starting to get suspicious.
I was accused of being a secret cutter.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.900
So wear long sleeves.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.996
I didn't realize we were inviting
more people here.

21:14.039 --> 21:17.406
Are you kidding?
A secret intern society?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.342
I'm all over that.

21:19.378 --> 21:22.074
Well, I still think we need
to take fewer risks.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.947
Fewer risks? Come on,
you got a guard at the door.

21:24.983 --> 21:27.781
You're using more local anesthetic
for three sutures

21:27.819 --> 21:29.946
than you would upstairs
for a chest tube.

21:29.988 --> 21:33.185
Look, I get that you're doing all this
to learn new skills,

21:33.225 --> 21:35.887
but you'll only learn so much
by being careful.

21:35.927 --> 21:39.624
Actually, I would disagree.
I think the only safe way to...

21:49.174 --> 21:50.664
Ouch.

21:55.414 --> 21:56.904
Who wants to stitch me up?

21:57.482 --> 21:59.109
Oh, right here.

22:05.590 --> 22:09.583
- You gonna tell me about Death and Die?
- Nope, but I did talk to Lexie for you.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.926
- I need you to do something for me.
- What?

22:11.963 --> 22:14.693
Tell Mark to keep
his Little Sloan out of Little Grey.

22:14.733 --> 22:18.294
- Is he hitting on you?
- No! Not my little Grey, Lexie's.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.865
The last thing she needs
is Sloan going man-whore on her.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.809
So you need to tell him
to step away from Little Grey.

22:25.844 --> 22:29.075
- I'll see what I can do.
- Little Grey, Derek. Little Grey.

22:38.256 --> 22:40.281
Did she, uh...

22:42.060 --> 22:44.893
- Did she say goodbye to you?
- Nope.

22:46.798 --> 22:50.256
- You OK?
- Do I look OK?

22:51.770 --> 22:53.328
You look great.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.573
Then I'm OK.

23:01.747 --> 23:06.775
So, there's a nine-day ritual
to undo a haunting?

23:07.552 --> 23:09.577
It starts with a nine-day ritual.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.851
Are you really gonna waste
nine days on this?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.393
- Dr. Stevens...
- Yes?

23:16.428 --> 23:19.056
Why are you so interested
in my haunting?

23:23.969 --> 23:27.905
Can ghosts do things? I mean, can they
make things happen in your life?

23:27.939 --> 23:30.772
I've had two cases,
two patients in a row

23:30.809 --> 23:34.540
that have really reminded me
of my dead fiancé.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.013
Heart transplants and LVADs.

23:37.048 --> 23:40.211
Could he be doing that?
Could he be bringing them to me?

23:40.252 --> 23:41.947
Izzie, come on.

23:43.188 --> 23:45.679
Is he here right now, your ghost?

23:48.527 --> 23:51.587
I... I hate to ask, but...

23:51.630 --> 23:52.892
Oh...

23:54.399 --> 23:56.367
You don't want me in your surgery.

23:56.935 --> 24:00.496
It's not that I think there's something
wrong with you, it's just...

24:00.539 --> 24:03.337
I don't need any extra ghosts
in my operating room.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.911
- Mr. Miller...
- What does a guy have to do

24:14.953 --> 24:17.183
to get a little peace and quiet
around here?

24:17.222 --> 24:20.919
The fatigue you're feeling is from
blood loss, queasiness, dizziness.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.893
You're slowly bleeding to death.

24:22.928 --> 24:25.988
- What, you trying to scare him?
- No.

24:26.031 --> 24:29.432
I'm trying to ascertain whether
he's suicidal or just defeated.

24:36.074 --> 24:39.475
Mr. Miller, you survive on the streets,
so I know you're a fighter.

24:39.511 --> 24:43.242
That doesn't make me a fighter.
Makes me lucky.

24:43.281 --> 24:45.841
How long have you been out there,
ten years, 20?

24:45.884 --> 24:49.411
You're not in jail, not dead.
That's not luck. You're smart.

24:49.454 --> 24:52.855
You gotta be smart to take care
of yourself on your own.

24:54.926 --> 24:55.950
I guess.

24:55.994 --> 24:59.657
This, what you're doing right now,
Mr. Miller,

24:59.698 --> 25:02.895
refusing surgery, it's not smart.

25:04.703 --> 25:07.194
There's a rehab center
not too far from here.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.969
Medicare takes care of it.
You could stay there.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.067
Food, bed, long as you need.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.707
Just let us operate.

25:15.814 --> 25:18.908
Let us operate,
and we'll figure the rest out.

25:32.697 --> 25:36.861
Wow. That's the fastest I've ever seen
anyone dissect through adhesions.

25:39.037 --> 25:44.805
Dr. Dixon, there is a rule regarding
giving medical waste to the patient.

25:45.844 --> 25:48.278
- Dr. Dixon?
- Huh... What?

25:49.915 --> 25:52.076
I was just saying there's a rule,

25:52.117 --> 25:54.847
an official, very, very specific rule,

25:54.886 --> 25:59.380
that, in the event a patient
asks for their organ

25:59.424 --> 26:01.551
or body part back, for any reason

26:01.593 --> 26:05.654
related to or involving
their cultural beliefs,

26:05.697 --> 26:10.225
we must respect that patient's wishes

26:10.268 --> 26:13.362
and return that organ to the patient.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.101
That is the rule
I forgot to tell you about.

26:16.975 --> 26:20.502
If I went down to pathology right now,
would they know about the rule?

26:20.545 --> 26:23.241
The chief would know. It's his rule.

26:23.281 --> 26:25.943
He declared it. Rule's a rule.

26:29.421 --> 26:35.451
Dr. Karev, make sure that
we follow the chief's rule

26:35.493 --> 26:38.724
and return the heart to the patient
after the surgery.

26:38.763 --> 26:42.529
I'm going back to work now. Clamp.

26:49.140 --> 26:52.303
What the hell is that gooey thing
they're taking out of him?

26:54.446 --> 26:57.779
Oh, the silent treatment.

26:57.816 --> 27:00.842
OK, if you're gonna be that way
I'll just, uh...

27:00.885 --> 27:04.548
I'll just stand here and be quiet.

27:08.426 --> 27:10.758
OK, that, that is disgusting.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.593
I thought you were gonna be quiet.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.829
You know you're acting like
you don't want me to be here.

27:16.868 --> 27:20.031
You know what I've wished for
every day since you died?

27:23.475 --> 27:25.636
I've wished that I could see you again.

27:26.878 --> 27:30.837
I'd have given anything
just to see you one more time.

27:32.484 --> 27:37.319
Looking at you and knowing that
I can't touch you, it's hurting me.

27:38.957 --> 27:42.449
- Izzie, you can touch me.
- You're not real.

27:43.528 --> 27:47.965
You can't be real,
so that means that I'm sick

27:47.999 --> 27:52.493
or something is wrong with me
and I can't hope for that.

27:54.572 --> 27:56.938
I can't hope...

28:00.578 --> 28:02.170
You're not real.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.875
Izzie, I am as real as you

28:04.916 --> 28:08.079
or that gooey,
disgusting thing down there.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.280
Touch me.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.831
Izzie... touch me.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.565
- I'll prove it to you.
- No!

28:27.605 --> 28:30.904
Why are you here? Why?

28:34.879 --> 28:37.370
I am here for you, Izzie Stevens.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.253
<i>Clamp.</i>

28:47.692 --> 28:51.059
OK, that's it.
The donor heart is separated.

28:51.096 --> 28:54.588
- We have the cannulas ready for bypass.
- Next step is the LVAD.

28:54.966 --> 28:57.434
Wait, what is that?

29:01.272 --> 29:05.402
That's not right.
That can't be happening.

29:05.443 --> 29:08.139
Heart's beating. How's
his heart beating on its own?

29:08.179 --> 29:11.706
It can't be happening.
It shouldn't be happening.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.116
The heart is beating.

29:14.152 --> 29:17.644
Heart is beating, it shouldn't
be beating. It shouldn't be beating.

29:26.064 --> 29:28.862
I've never seen
a reconstruction like this.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.869
Never done one like this.
Here's hoping it works.

29:33.204 --> 29:35.502
Ready for the rod.
How are you guys doing?

29:35.540 --> 29:38.100
Hemorrhaging
bleeding through the packing.

29:38.143 --> 29:40.577
- Try the fibrin sealant.
- Good call.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.172
- How are you doing?
- Good, moving to the next lac.

29:43.214 --> 29:44.806
Finished already? Let me see.

29:46.151 --> 29:47.379
Wow.

29:47.519 --> 29:51.819
- Pulley stitches. Nicely done.
- Thank you, Dr. Sloan.

29:56.294 --> 29:59.286
- So my heart?
- Started beating by itself.

29:59.330 --> 30:01.525
If it continues to function like this

30:01.566 --> 30:03.966
you won't need an LVAD
or any kind of machinery.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.765
It's wonderful news.

30:05.804 --> 30:11.470
- It's very atypical.
- Not for me. I'm finally free.

30:11.509 --> 30:13.636
I'm not haunted anymore.

30:13.678 --> 30:15.339
Your heart had six years to rest,

30:15.380 --> 30:17.712
probably enough time for it
to repair itself,

30:17.749 --> 30:20.946
which is why it started beating again.
Never seen this before.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.976
Read about it
but never seen it before.

30:23.021 --> 30:25.649
You have your beliefs, I have mine.

30:28.326 --> 30:32.626
- I don't have beliefs, I have science.
- Science is a belief,

30:32.664 --> 30:36.464
a belief in only
what you can see and touch.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.469
I believe in more.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.575
Just thought I'd stop in
to see how everything's going.

30:45.610 --> 30:48.909
I'm still several hours away,
but I may actually pull this off.

30:48.947 --> 30:51.848
Rebuilding a man's skeleton
from scratch.

30:51.883 --> 30:55.842
And we just found out that Dr. Grey
here can out-pulley stitch Shepherd.

30:55.887 --> 31:00.449
- I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
- Excellent job, Dr. Grey.

31:00.491 --> 31:03.790
- Excellent job of teaching, Dr. Yang.
- Sir?

31:03.828 --> 31:07.491
Taking time to teach your
interns and they retain the knowledge.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.057
Haven't made my decision yet
on the solo surgery,

31:10.101 --> 31:12.865
but keep teaching like that
and you're my one to watch.

31:13.838 --> 31:15.396
Thank you, sir.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.211
- V-fib.
- Start CPR.

31:20.245 --> 31:23.703
Push one of epi and
charge the paddles to 360.

31:23.748 --> 31:25.875
Clear.

31:30.588 --> 31:31.748
Thank you.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.158
Thank you so much.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.826
So what do you do now
with the haunted piece? Bury it or...?

31:39.864 --> 31:44.631
Burn it. Actually, my tribe's
medicine man will burn it.

31:45.670 --> 31:48.104
I'm not allowed to even touch the smoke.

31:48.139 --> 31:51.768
So the not-touching thing,
does that apply to just the flesh or...?

31:51.809 --> 31:53.902
No, we don't touch their belongings.

31:53.945 --> 31:58.382
We can cleanse jewelry, metals,
but fabric, bedding, clothes,

31:58.416 --> 32:02.512
books that were owned by the dead,
we burn all of it.

32:03.621 --> 32:06.852
The spirit can cling to any of it.

32:09.761 --> 32:13.060
Oh, no. Your ghost.

32:14.299 --> 32:16.927
You still don't have anything
of his, do you?

32:23.841 --> 32:26.469
Time of death, 19:22.

32:38.589 --> 32:40.284
I built his bones.

32:40.325 --> 32:43.954
You tried. We all tried.

32:44.729 --> 32:46.492
No, I didn't try, I did it.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.494
I did my part, I built his bones.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.968
I built his bones from scratch,

32:52.003 --> 32:56.838
and you, all of you, you were
supposed to keep him alive.

32:58.209 --> 33:01.144
That is all you people had to do.
You just had to...

33:01.179 --> 33:02.771
...keep his body breathing.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.306
You just had to keep him
safe and breathing and living

33:06.351 --> 33:10.651
until I made his bones.
I made... I made his bones.

33:10.688 --> 33:14.954
Until I made his bones.
I made his bones.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.460
I made his bones.

33:16.494 --> 33:19.463
Why don't you guys go ahead
and I'll help Dr. Torres clean up.

33:21.332 --> 33:24.301
- Go call the morgue.
- We've got it. Go.

33:26.204 --> 33:29.196
Everyone, clear out.

33:55.166 --> 33:58.431
Uh... Excellent job today, Dr. Dixon.

33:58.469 --> 34:01.836
Excellent rule following.

34:10.481 --> 34:14.382
I only have one real area
of interest. The human heart. I love it.

34:14.418 --> 34:18.378
I like its regularity. I know
everything there is to know about it.

34:18.422 --> 34:21.221
I like its predictability. It has rules.

34:21.259 --> 34:24.456
Every chamber has a function,
every function has a movement.

34:24.495 --> 34:28.397
I like the color.
It's comforting.

34:30.101 --> 34:33.559
Are you familiar with
Asperger's syndrome, Dr. Bailey?

34:33.603 --> 34:39.474
Um... Of course. Significant impairment
during social situations...

34:42.045 --> 34:45.344
I'm not good at cues
like sarcasm or condescension,

34:45.382 --> 34:48.681
but I do know when I'm being
manipulated and made fun of.

34:49.587 --> 34:52.556
I don't think I like this hospital
very much.

34:57.061 --> 34:59.427
I don't think
I like this hospital at all.

35:07.472 --> 35:10.441
Lexie Grey sure knows how
to wrap herself around a suture.

35:10.475 --> 35:13.444
- Mark, Meredith had some concerns.
- That's not news.

35:13.478 --> 35:17.209
About Lexie.
Apparently Lexie is fragile,

35:17.248 --> 35:20.649
and getting involved with a superior
might make her more fragile.

35:20.685 --> 35:22.619
I was talking about her sutures.

35:22.653 --> 35:25.178
Keep Little Sloan
out of Little Grey is my point.

35:25.223 --> 35:26.520
- What?
- Little Sloan

35:26.557 --> 35:28.684
does not enter Little Grey.
Are we clear?

35:28.726 --> 35:30.387
- Did you just say...?
- Hmm-hmm.

35:30.428 --> 35:33.920
OK, that's just creepy...
and inaccurate.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.263
Big Sloan.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.564
You heading home?

35:50.515 --> 35:51.709
I love you.

35:53.651 --> 35:57.610
I will always love you.
You own a piece of me.

35:59.090 --> 36:01.422
So even though you'll be gone...

36:02.727 --> 36:05.560
...you will never be forgotten.
Not by me.

36:07.131 --> 36:08.928
I'm sorry we never got our chance.

36:08.966 --> 36:13.869
I'm sorry we never got to get married,
have children or grow old together.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.770
I wanted that so much.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.569
I wanted to be your wife
more than anything.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.976
Why are you telling me this?

36:24.015 --> 36:28.850
I'm trying to let you go
so that your soul could be at peace.

36:29.787 --> 36:33.848
I have peace, Izzie. I'm here for you.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.260
Goodbye, Denny.

36:40.298 --> 36:43.131
I love you, but goodbye.

36:58.182 --> 36:59.444
I can explain.

37:03.054 --> 37:06.854
I did not teach you the parallel pulley
stitch. I can barely do it myself.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.916
Whatever you guys are doing,
shut it down.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.429
Do not practice on yourself.
That is insane.

37:13.130 --> 37:14.620
Shut it down.

37:20.871 --> 37:21.895
Iz?

37:30.481 --> 37:32.381
I see you.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.511
I've seen you all day.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.350
I see you struggling.

37:38.623 --> 37:41.387
And I know you don't want my help,
but let me help you.

37:45.496 --> 37:47.726
Whatever it is, I can help you.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.590
So let me.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.078
Will you burn this for me?

38:07.652 --> 38:09.119
I hate how hard it is.

38:09.153 --> 38:12.816
It's just like...
You get attached to someone,

38:12.857 --> 38:15.985
they work their way into your life
and you wake up one day...

38:16.027 --> 38:18.723
Suddenly all you can think about
is their little...

38:20.464 --> 38:22.489
- Another round?
- Oh, I'll get it.

38:35.413 --> 38:38.905
- Tell me the stories.
- What stories?

38:38.949 --> 38:41.577
The ones you won't let Sadie tell me.

38:42.086 --> 38:45.453
They're ancient history.
Humiliating and ridiculous.

38:45.489 --> 38:48.981
Ridiculous is a grown man
telling another grown man

38:49.026 --> 38:51.460
- to stay out of a woman's little...
- You did it?

38:51.495 --> 38:55.226
I did. Those exact words.
I did it because...

38:55.266 --> 38:58.861
...it was nice to see you
sticking up for your sister.

38:58.903 --> 39:00.871
I did it for you.

39:00.905 --> 39:03.601
So now, you owe me...

39:04.508 --> 39:05.941
...a story.

39:07.645 --> 39:09.078
OK, fine.

39:09.113 --> 39:12.412
But you can never tell anyone ever.

39:18.255 --> 39:19.279
Hey.

39:23.227 --> 39:26.685
I'm sorry we lost him,
the patient. I'm sorry.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.494
I don't need you to be sorry.

39:30.067 --> 39:31.898
- OK.
- I don't need you to be sorry.

39:31.936 --> 39:35.372
- I don't need you. I don't need you.
- OK. All right. All right.

40:10.975 --> 40:14.411
<i>The ties that bind us</i>
<i>are sometimes impossible to explain.</i>

40:20.651 --> 40:25.179
<i>They connect us, even after</i>
<i>it seems like the ties should be broken.</i>

40:37.802 --> 40:40.236
<i>Some bonds defy distance.</i>

40:40.938 --> 40:43.429
<i>And time. And logic.</i>

40:45.342 --> 40:48.436
Oh, God. I said goodbye.

40:48.479 --> 40:50.845
I burned the sweater.

40:50.881 --> 40:53.850
Yeah, thanks for that, by the way.
I loved that sweater.

40:53.884 --> 40:57.718
- You made me that sweater.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

40:57.755 --> 41:00.383
- Izzie!
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

41:01.225 --> 41:03.887
- Stop freaking out.
- You're not real.

41:03.928 --> 41:08.592
- Hey, I told you, I'm here for you.
- You're not real, you're not real.

41:08.632 --> 41:13.467
- You're not real.
- Izzie, look at me.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.011
Touch me.

41:43.434 --> 41:47.393
You see? I told you I was real.

41:55.946 --> 41:57.311
Oh, my God.

42:05.556 --> 42:08.582
<i>Because some ties</i>
<i>are simply...</i>

42:14.064 --> 42:16.294
<i>...meant to be.</i>
