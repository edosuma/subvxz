WEBVTT

01:35.178 --> 01:37.597
Retirement, here I come, motherfuckers.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.733
Ah.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.238
What's your name again, baby?

01:53.321 --> 01:55.198
I'm still Sindy, baby!

01:57.325 --> 01:59.077
Well, hello again, Sindy baby.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.287
- How about a little bubbly?
- Oh, yeah!

02:03.164 --> 02:05.333
Whoa!

02:05.416 --> 02:07.085
You got a little on you!

02:07.168 --> 02:08.002
Come here.

02:12.006 --> 02:12.924
Woo-woo!

02:19.180 --> 02:21.141
- ...thirteen, fourteen...
- Yeah, baby!

02:21.224 --> 02:22.142
...fifteen...

02:22.225 --> 02:23.601
You're so strong!

02:24.352 --> 02:25.478
In position.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.524
Woo-hoo!

02:29.607 --> 02:31.151
You like that?

02:31.234 --> 02:32.318
You know I do!

02:32.902 --> 02:33.987
You got it, babe!

02:36.531 --> 02:38.324
You're such a great dancer.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.784
Oh, yes!

02:43.329 --> 02:45.957
- Come here, honey.
- Oh, these hips don't lie.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.500
- Rawr!
- You like that?

02:47.584 --> 02:48.835
I love it! Come here.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.882
Easy now, Disco Man.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.598
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

03:07.770 --> 03:09.272
It's blow time, mister.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.691
- Oh, is that an order?
- Mm-hmm.

03:11.774 --> 03:12.775
Be my guest.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.235
Oh, yeah.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.445
Hello there.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.451
This retirement thing
is really working out.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.995
Thank you, thank you.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.206
Bang.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.753
Moving in.

03:36.925 --> 03:37.925
Hey!

03:44.098 --> 03:45.225
Oh, God, fuck!

03:45.308 --> 03:46.601
I fuckin' love that song!

03:46.684 --> 03:48.019
- All you, Facundo.
- Oh!

03:58.905 --> 03:59.739
Why?

03:59.822 --> 04:02.116
- You got old, Michael.
- Sindy bab...

04:03.826 --> 04:05.411
Not that old, after all.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.657
Karl, we're ready
to get the fuck out of here.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.337
At your service!
Please come onboard.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.801
Yeah. It's done. We're heading back now.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.975
Fasten your seatbelts.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.898
Enjoy the ride.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.186
Woo-woo!

04:35.775 --> 04:37.735
Great job, Facundo.
See you back at the mansion.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.696
Yes, ma'am. Safe flight.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.518
Okay, sweetie,
Dr. Becker will see you now.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.983
If I can get you to take
a nice deep breath in.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.234
And out.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.778
And once more.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.697
And out.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.074
Oh.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.994
Lung's good... considering.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.291
It's never too late to get
that metal removed.

05:33.916 --> 05:34.959
Lift the arm up.

05:37.795 --> 05:38.963
Gosh, it must hurt.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.132
Eh, it's not too bad.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.718
Okay, you can lower it.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.850
How's the hearing
in that left ear, Duncan?

05:50.933 --> 05:51.933
What was that?

05:53.019 --> 05:54.854
Funny. Very funny.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.066
Did you get all the shots I recommended?

05:58.149 --> 05:59.776
Hep-A? Shingles?

05:59.859 --> 06:01.152
All good.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.404
Okay. If you lie down
on your side, please.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.954
And I'll get you to bring your knees
up to your chest, please.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.625
Okay.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.127
And deep breath.

06:21.589 --> 06:24.509
When people ask me why I save
the prostate exam till last,

06:25.426 --> 06:28.586
I just think it's nice for my patients
to have something fun to look forward to.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.556
And exhale.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.099
We're done.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.646
Oh, I baked a pear tartine.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.360
- You want some?
- Thanks.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.820
All right!

06:43.903 --> 06:44.903
Here you go.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.364
Homemade.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.743
What are you looking forward to most
about retiring?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.079
Don't know. The normal stuff.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.374
The most dangerous time for men
is the year they retire.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.210
They take up some crazy sport.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.672
They ditch their wife and fuck girls
younger than their daughters.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.382
They think they're king of the world.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.761
It's not always the things
I test for that get you.

07:09.637 --> 07:14.100
We got you covered for cancer
and heart disease and basic human biology.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.020
But sometimes the killer's in your head.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.190
The mental side of retirement. Phew.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.774
It can be deadly.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.278
Mmm.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.905
Wow! This pie is great. Hmm.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.076
What about cigarettes?

07:33.578 --> 07:34.578
I quit.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.163
Good for you.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.231
Yes, going through your
financial report, the good news,

07:44.255 --> 07:48.217
yes, is that you've got
no financial worries at all.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.100
Will you be making the same
charity donation again this year,

07:56.184 --> 07:58.936
$200,000, yes?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.730
- Yes.
- Yes.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.899
Same recipient, the trust, yes?

08:03.399 --> 08:04.650
- Yes.
- Yes.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.319
And from the same bank account,

08:06.402 --> 08:09.530
the Montana Union Credit Bank, yes?

08:13.451 --> 08:14.702
Yes.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.705
As per your employment agreement,

08:17.788 --> 08:21.000
Damocles will be matching
your pension contributions,

08:21.083 --> 08:22.251
which have been substantial.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.711
You have put away the maximum

08:23.794 --> 08:29.884
and the company plan has seen it grow
at a rate of a good six percent per year.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.429
You can draw half of that
on your official retirement date,

08:34.514 --> 08:36.724
which is in...

08:37.225 --> 08:38.225
Fourteen days.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.769
Yes!

08:39.852 --> 08:42.480
Then in 14 days,

08:42.563 --> 08:45.650
Damocles will be cutting you a check

08:46.150 --> 08:48.694
for the best part of...

08:49.278 --> 08:52.907
eight million
two hundred and seven thousand

08:52.990 --> 08:56.619
five hundred and twenty-three dollars
and four cents.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.829
How about that, Mr. Vizla?

09:04.794 --> 09:08.339
You have properties in four states, yes?

09:08.422 --> 09:11.592
I just need to know which one
you'll be retiring to so...

09:11.676 --> 09:13.052
Use the Florida address.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.805
The Florida address, yes.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.559
Keeping the old golf handicap down?

09:20.142 --> 09:21.142
Yes?

09:21.894 --> 09:22.770
Yes.

09:22.853 --> 09:23.854
Yes.

09:29.318 --> 09:32.280
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

09:32.363 --> 09:34.156
I shall fear no evil,

09:34.240 --> 09:35.700
for you are with me.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.952
Your rod and your staff comfort me...

09:45.001 --> 09:47.878
And I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.379
Speak.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.844
- You wanted to talk.
- You watching me?

09:54.302 --> 09:55.136
Yep.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.721
We need to meet.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.806
- Jimmy's in ten.
- I'll be there.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.109
Dom Pérignon, 2004.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.902
You remembered.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.202
- It's good to see you, Duncan.
- What happened to Michael?

10:21.871 --> 10:25.541
I figured you might show up,
so I brought you this.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.880
Apparently, he'd been partying
in his big-ass McMansion down in Chile

10:30.963 --> 10:33.007
for days when he got attacked.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.093
- And for you, sir?
- No.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.804
- You're not drinking?
- I quit.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.474
What's this about, Vivian?

10:44.894 --> 10:48.564
Michael was the fourth dead Damocles agent
in the past month.

10:50.775 --> 10:54.195
Our intel says Michael's killer
is tied to a Russian outlet.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.739
They hired some Mexican hit man

10:56.822 --> 10:59.742
by the name of Pedro Gonzalez Gonzales.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.244
He's currently staking out
in Belarus, Russia.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.666
Your old boss, Blut,
sanctioned a revenge hit.

11:06.749 --> 11:10.586
A million dollar bullet
to tell this pendejo

11:11.087 --> 11:12.922
that we are not to be fucked with.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.674
Well, Blut fired me.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.760
Oh, don't be such a cry-baby.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.639
He lets go of everybody at 50.
You know that. Company fucking policy.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.433
You can't be a hit man with Alzheimer's.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.143
Get one of the young guys, then.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.106
Technically, you're still active
for the next two weeks.

11:32.191 --> 11:36.445
This needs somebody
with more finesse, more...

11:37.446 --> 11:38.656
experience.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.534
Why don't you do it?

11:41.617 --> 11:42.660
He wants you.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.663
The Black Kaiser.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.680
...got me some Lip Smackers for
the store just like you said I should.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.151
- Oh, the flavored ones!
- Yeah!

12:57.234 --> 13:00.196
I got strawberry, I got raspberry,
I got rhubarb.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.479
- But do they taste good?
- They do.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.200
I was thinking, maybe in the summer,

13:04.283 --> 13:06.660
I could do a promotional tie-in
with the pies.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.038
- Did you say "Italian"?
- No, a tie-in.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.207
- It's like marketing.
- Like a commercial.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.042
- Absolutely!
- Like on TV.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.045
Do you remember that TV series
that I was telling you about?

13:16.378 --> 13:18.756
Mm-hmm.
You have to start it from the beginning.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.466
I got it in the box across the street.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.052
Now, it's British,
but you can put the subtitles on.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.639
- It sounds kind of religious.
- It's not as religious as you might think.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.724
Do you find Jesus attractive?

13:28.808 --> 13:31.060
Oh, my, Jesus is a handsome man, isn't he?

14:03.801 --> 14:04.801
Hey.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.137
He likes you, man.

14:07.638 --> 14:08.638
What's his name?

14:09.056 --> 14:10.391
He doesn't have one.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.434
I like dogs with human names.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.770
- Like what?
- Like "Rusty."

14:15.271 --> 14:18.274
I don't know anyone human named Rusty.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.901
- Isn't that a dog's name?
- No, it's human.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.736
Okay, whatever you say, man.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.072
He's only 50 bucks.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.200
I don't need a dog.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.869
Okay.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.473
Finally you're free.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.807
After all these years.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.977
I want to take a picture of this moment.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.829
Pretty good, huh?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.627
Ah.

16:39.915 --> 16:40.915
Rusty?

16:45.879 --> 16:47.006
Shit...

17:16.660 --> 17:18.078
Oh, shit!

17:52.738 --> 17:55.058
It's not about who you are
or what you think...

17:56.158 --> 17:57.451
Just imagine. You and me.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.536
There's a strong energy between us, right?

17:59.620 --> 18:01.914
I quite enjoy writing my feelings
down in a journal.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.378
The bond between
an elephant cub and its mother

18:49.461 --> 18:51.004
is unmistakable...

18:59.763 --> 19:01.974
- Speak.
- I got your message.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.225
Which one?

19:04.184 --> 19:06.103
The first or the 15th?

19:06.478 --> 19:08.188
You only get 30 seconds.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.232
Blut won't take no for an answer.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.194
You didn't hang up, so I assume
you want to know how much.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.030
Two million. One now, one when it's done.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.282
It's still a no.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.618
This shit-spit really struggles
with that two-letter word.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.829
What the fuck else you got going on?

19:23.912 --> 19:24.955
A lot.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.499
You don't strike me as a man with a hobby.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.668
- Your 30 seconds is up.
- Jesus, Mary, fuck.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.631
Are you retired or ret...

19:44.725 --> 19:47.227
It's $2 million.
Don't make me fuckin' beg.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.937
Leave the file on the company server.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.314
You don't have to be such...

19:57.237 --> 19:58.238
You did well.

19:58.906 --> 20:02.326
Though,
your description of me as a shit-spit

20:02.409 --> 20:03.827
didn't go unnoticed.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.164
Does he scare you?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.249
You fucking scare me.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.921
Just talking to the Black Kaiser
makes you nervous.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.757
You're shaking.

20:26.141 --> 20:28.261
You should just forget about him
and move on.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.729
Who can forget about the Black Kaiser?

20:31.521 --> 20:33.357
So very special!

20:34.608 --> 20:36.151
This is a bad idea.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.444
Spare me the lecture.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.614
Unless you have a better way
of putting him in our crosshairs

20:40.697 --> 20:42.741
and saving me $8 million.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.285
So shut the fuck up

20:45.369 --> 20:46.703
and let's go with my plan

20:46.787 --> 20:49.539
and send him to Belarus to die.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.209
If he accepts this assignment,

20:52.292 --> 20:56.171
he'll expect $1 million in his account
before he makes a move.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.548
I need authorization to make it happen.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.763
Ha! Ha! Yah!

21:46.847 --> 21:48.849
Ha, ha! Yah!

21:55.647 --> 21:59.651
As you know,
swords are synonymous with Damocles,

21:59.735 --> 22:01.862
but this...

22:01.945 --> 22:04.448
...this is my most special sword.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.660
Owned by the great
German general Arminius,

22:08.744 --> 22:12.039
butcher of the Romans
at Teutoburg Forest.

22:12.122 --> 22:17.002
The handle is made from Roman bone.

22:19.212 --> 22:22.632
My father was a big fan
of this kind of stuff.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.509
Papa.

22:28.472 --> 22:32.809
Thank you for your incredible sword show
and touching story.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.103
Now, let's get down to business.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.190
We have some questions regarding
the purchase of Damocles.

22:38.273 --> 22:42.694
Accounts show this year,
your liabilities are at 29 million,

22:43.278 --> 22:47.866
yet next year your liabilities
are predicted to be paid off.

22:47.949 --> 22:48.867
Correct.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.995
In fact, we were surprised to see
that they have become revenue.

22:52.579 --> 22:53.579
Correct.

22:53.622 --> 22:57.376
This seems to be done in order
to inflate the value of your company.

22:57.459 --> 23:00.962
We control the pensions
of our former employees.

23:01.046 --> 23:05.092
They pay into our fund,
we match their contributions,

23:05.175 --> 23:06.843
and manage the investments.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.179
Please do explain, Mr Blut.

23:09.262 --> 23:14.684
It's our company policy that all
our agents must retire at the age of 50.

23:15.185 --> 23:19.606
We have a plethora of agents
who have now reached this milestone.

23:20.107 --> 23:24.361
Their combined fund
adds up to $29 million.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.738
How do you consider this income?

23:26.822 --> 23:31.034
If our agents were to die
in the field of duty

23:31.118 --> 23:33.495
or in an unspecified accident,

23:34.413 --> 23:39.292
the clause in their contract states
that Damocles would be the beneficiary.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.629
And you are assuming they will die?

23:43.213 --> 23:45.424
I don't assume they will die,

23:46.174 --> 23:47.509
I guarantee it.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.971
If you can uphold that guarantee,

23:51.471 --> 23:53.598
we will move forward with this deal.

23:54.724 --> 23:55.976
Santé.

24:00.647 --> 24:01.647
Ah!

25:10.300 --> 25:12.761
The train woke me up again.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.554
I can't sleep.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.056
Go back to bed, baby.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.601
I'll be back.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.973
Do you want to go
somewhere else for a few days?

25:59.808 --> 26:01.851
Let the kid get a good night of sleep.

26:01.935 --> 26:06.106
You pay me for sex.
My regular life is not for sale.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.780
How much for two nights?

26:15.865 --> 26:17.200
He's not your kid.

26:18.159 --> 26:19.202
I know.

26:21.871 --> 26:23.123
How much?

26:30.589 --> 26:32.632
Excuse me.

26:33.341 --> 26:35.427
Hotel service.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.428
Madam.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.055
Yes.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.642
Yes, I'll call maintenance right away.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.271
Thank you so much.

27:01.828 --> 27:04.873
A woman and her son
are locked inside.

27:04.956 --> 27:09.836
These doors have high security deadlocks
for our VIP guests.

27:09.919 --> 27:12.005
We can't release it from the outside.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.717
I have to drill it.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.346
Okay, but try to keep it down.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.150
Speak!

27:32.233 --> 27:33.568
No fucking way!

27:34.486 --> 27:36.488
Yes, you said that two days ago.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.283
When the fuck is he coming?

27:41.409 --> 27:44.079
What is that fucking sound?

27:44.663 --> 27:45.789
Shit!

27:47.248 --> 27:48.375
What is that fucking sound?

27:49.751 --> 27:50.794
What the hell is this?

27:50.877 --> 27:52.629
You know we are in here!

27:52.712 --> 27:54.422
We are so sorry, sir.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.382
What?

27:55.465 --> 27:56.675
We're just...

27:56.758 --> 27:58.009
- Sir!
- ¡Oye, cabrón!

28:42.220 --> 28:43.805
Sit down.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.557
Shh.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.350
Be quiet.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.314
I need some answers.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.860
Nod if you understand.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.112
I was sent to kill you.

28:59.195 --> 29:02.741
But it looks
like I'm the target here, right?

29:02.824 --> 29:03.742
Yes.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.119
Do you know who ordered this?

29:06.202 --> 29:07.620
I don't know anything.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.667
I don't know anything.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.462
I need to make sure
you're telling me the truth.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.965
I'm not lying!

29:19.048 --> 29:21.593
I swear!

29:23.470 --> 29:25.305
I'm not lying!

29:28.057 --> 29:30.101
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

29:51.539 --> 29:52.539
Speak.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.001
Do you have authorization
to hire me for the Belarus job?

29:55.084 --> 29:59.631
Yes. The first 50 percent is sitting
in a payable account, ready to go.

29:59.714 --> 30:00.714
Wire it over.

30:08.973 --> 30:09.808
Boom.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.059
One million dollars...

30:12.060 --> 30:13.060
sent.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.941
Okay, the job is done.
I'll send you a picture.

30:18.024 --> 30:20.193
Wait, what? Duncan...

30:24.155 --> 30:25.155
Shit!

30:30.870 --> 30:32.270
- Duncan...
- I want the second half

30:32.330 --> 30:34.457
of my payment in 24 hours.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.292
Vivian, somebody set me up over here.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.216
You better pray
you have nothing to do with it.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.310
- Duncan...
- Don't ever contact me again.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.176
Spank me again!

30:47.554 --> 30:48.805
Let's go.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.772
Let's leave.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.733
Come on, let's go. Don't look.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.743
Somebody call the police!

31:28.636 --> 31:30.876
You make all this money
from killing people?

31:35.310 --> 31:38.271
We could have been killed up there.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.317
One day...

31:43.568 --> 31:45.778
even you will get killed.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.449
Don't come near me again.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.440
How nice to see you, Ms. Vivian!

32:23.316 --> 32:24.776
Where's the shit-spit?

32:24.859 --> 32:26.027
Mr. Blut is busy.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.446
He's not answering my calls.
What the fuck is he doing?

32:29.948 --> 32:31.991
A cup of tea to calm down, Ms. Vivian?

32:32.075 --> 32:34.577
This is not a convenient time.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.579
I don't give a shit what time it is.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.749
You tried to kill the Black Kaiser

32:39.832 --> 32:42.669
with some low-rent Mexican clowns?

32:43.294 --> 32:44.420
Yeah, that plan worked well.

32:45.046 --> 32:47.256
I told you we should
leave him the fuck alone.

32:48.299 --> 32:51.135
- You worry too much.
- You have to pay him everything now.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.847
I don't have to do shit
until his birthday.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.141
Right.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.938
Pay him the second half of his fee

33:02.021 --> 33:04.023
so we don't have to look over
our fucking shoulder

33:04.107 --> 33:05.566
for the rest of our lives.

33:06.609 --> 33:07.694
Okay, do it.

33:08.277 --> 33:09.320
Smart move.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.030
I'll send in the A-team.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.573
They'll get it done.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.367
Whatever.
As long as you pay him.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.338
These are all the properties he owns?

33:27.922 --> 33:29.841
Y-Yes, all of them.

33:29.924 --> 33:34.095
I can't see where it says one of them
is his actual permanent address.

33:34.595 --> 33:35.972
His home base?

33:37.348 --> 33:39.684
- He... He...
- Florida? Texas?

33:39.767 --> 33:41.185
Where does he live, Paul?

33:41.269 --> 33:43.062
He doesn't tell me much.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.148
He moves around a lot. Yeah, I...

33:45.231 --> 33:48.651
I know that from... from his,
uh, accounts.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.236
I want to see these accounts.

33:51.446 --> 33:54.741
The profit and loss, expenses.
I want everything.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.117
Please let me go.

34:02.582 --> 34:07.795
Yeah, it's all in there, under V.
V for Vizla.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.922
Duncan V-Vizla.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.929
For 20 years, I... I worked for him.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.725
- Please let me go.
- Thank you, Paul.

34:21.559 --> 34:22.726
Y-You're welcome.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.871
- You've been very helpful.
- I can still be helpful.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.356
I can call and s-send him a message.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.818
That's how we do it. Talk to him.
I'm good at that. And you can trace him.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.737
Or we could meet at a coffee shop

34:32.820 --> 34:34.362
or... or at a park.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.324
He trusts me. He always says that.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.367
"You and me, Paul, I trust you."

34:38.451 --> 34:41.496
He does. Yes, he really trusts me. Yes!

34:48.127 --> 34:49.127
Take all the files.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.505
Let's start with Florida.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.964
I have a perfect outfit.

34:59.597 --> 35:03.309
No, we didn't deliver any logs
and we only deliver what we get asked.

35:03.392 --> 35:06.437
Logs are expensive. It's not like
they grow on trees, you know!

35:06.521 --> 35:08.981
Yeah, I know, but my woodpile got filled.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.234
I mean, that doesn't just happen.

35:11.317 --> 35:13.986
Sounds to me
like you've got yourself a magic woodpile.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.656
Golden goose would be better,
but we don't get to pick and choose

35:16.739 --> 35:18.616
what sort of supernatural events
we witness.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.827
Oh, hey, there's your neighbor!

35:20.910 --> 35:22.912
Did you happen to see anything peculiar

35:22.995 --> 35:25.081
out by your place
over the past couple days?

35:25.164 --> 35:29.043
Perhaps some sort of supernatural event
of someone dumping a truckload of logs?

35:29.127 --> 35:31.796
- No.
- This young lady rents up where you are.

35:31.879 --> 35:34.465
You can probably see her cabin
from your place across the lake.

35:35.174 --> 35:36.217
Maybe not, I don't know.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.928
Seems her woodpile
got filled up as if by magic!

35:42.598 --> 35:45.393
- Shit! I'm so sorry.
- Let it be. Let it be.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.562
I should have fixed that door years ago.

35:47.645 --> 35:51.482
Well, well, well,
look who's having himself a birthday!

35:51.566 --> 35:54.286
And baking a Betty Crocker.
So much better when you make it yourself.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.487
You know, I got all sorts
of fun party stuff.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.614
I got streamers and balloons and poppers.

35:58.698 --> 35:59.574
Come on back this way.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.577
I got paper plates
with Disney folk on 'em and napkins.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.082
...easy way to make some delicious cakes.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.168
You'll love these recipes

36:10.251 --> 36:11.752
just as much as I do.

36:14.630 --> 36:17.842
...you may find this process
even more satisfying

36:17.925 --> 36:18.968
with the smell wafting...

36:59.508 --> 37:00.508
Hello?

37:03.179 --> 37:06.974
Hi there!
Um, I'm looking for apartment 506.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.434
What's it say on the door?

37:09.560 --> 37:10.978
Sorry! I didn't see that.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.773
- Come in.
- Great! Um...

37:13.856 --> 37:15.608
I've been expecting you.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.787
So, is your name Mr. Vizla?

37:27.870 --> 37:30.831
- Mr. Duncan Viz...
- You want a drink before we get started?

37:30.915 --> 37:32.625
No. No drink, thanks.

37:33.209 --> 37:36.087
I'm really just here
regarding the questionnaire.

37:36.170 --> 37:40.091
- Oh, yeah.
- We are making a survey...

37:43.970 --> 37:46.764
So, what are you into? Being hit?

37:46.847 --> 37:48.224
Strangled?

37:48.307 --> 37:49.767
You like takin' it up the ass?

37:49.850 --> 37:51.018
It's not him.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.354
- What'd you say to me?
- It's not him!

37:53.437 --> 37:56.232
What'd you fucking say?
What the fuck? My door!

37:57.066 --> 37:58.109
Who the fuck are you?

37:58.192 --> 37:59.235
Fuck this!

37:59.610 --> 38:01.946
- Do you have a fucking warrant?
- Who do you pay rent to?

38:02.029 --> 38:04.865
I didn't fucking touch her.
You're paying for the fucking door!

38:06.784 --> 38:08.661
Fuck! My teeth!

38:08.744 --> 38:10.788
- Who do you pay rent to?!
- Shit!

38:10.871 --> 38:12.498
What are you fucking talking about?

38:13.249 --> 38:14.542
Some fucking accountant.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.586
- His name Lomas?
- Yeah. That's his name. Why?

38:17.670 --> 38:19.005
This is fucking stupid!

38:19.088 --> 38:20.088
I'm not saying anyth...

38:25.594 --> 38:26.594
Sindy!

38:27.305 --> 38:29.098
Sindy, enough! Let's go!

38:30.850 --> 38:31.976
- Speak.
- Yeah.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.854
Nah, he's not here.
We're moving to the next location.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.939
Don't leave any witnesses behind,
you hear me?

38:37.023 --> 38:38.399
Yeah, whatever you say, ma'am.

38:38.482 --> 38:41.193
I'm serious. And call me
from the next location.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.029
- Find him.
- Okay, we're on it.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.947
I think he's dead now, Sindy.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.324
Let's go to breakfast.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.993
Good idea. Eggs and toast.
You're paying this time, goddamn it.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.536
Yeah, I'm fucking starving.

38:54.582 --> 38:55.582
Thanks.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.633
- Winter coffee?
- Yes, please.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.602
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.947
It's funny we're neighbors.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.954
Yes. That is funny.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.215
You live in the house with the big porch.

39:44.298 --> 39:45.299
Yes.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.889
I live in the gray cabin,
just across the lake.

39:55.017 --> 39:56.519
- It's so funny.
- That is funny.

40:05.611 --> 40:06.862
I like it here.

40:08.656 --> 40:09.656
Me too.

40:11.951 --> 40:15.037
- It's peaceful.
- Yeah.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.419
It makes me peaceful.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.256
Me too.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.763
- I'm so, so sorry.
- It's totally fine.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.682
It's okay. It's fine.

40:34.765 --> 40:35.765
Okay.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.720
I don't know, man!

41:12.803 --> 41:14.346
It's not my house!

41:15.055 --> 41:16.055
- It's just...
- Boom!

41:17.933 --> 41:19.435
...give a shit if we stay here.

41:19.518 --> 41:21.187
- Hey, man.
- The place is always empty.

41:21.270 --> 41:24.440
I need you to answer
a simple question, okay?

41:24.523 --> 41:26.650
Who do you pay rent to?

41:26.734 --> 41:28.527
Is it Duncan Vizla?

41:28.611 --> 41:31.363
Bro, we don't live here! We don't pay.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.032
- I don't owe shit!
- Well...

41:33.115 --> 41:35.034
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't...

41:35.117 --> 41:36.997
All right, I'm coming.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.080
Who the hell are you?
Where's Shotgun Frank?

41:40.164 --> 41:42.500
You should probably get the fuck
out of here, sweetie.

41:42.583 --> 41:43.768
- I'm just here to...
- Whatever.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.836
- Wrong place at the wrong time.
- Please!

41:46.712 --> 41:48.422
What the fuck is going on in there?

41:50.549 --> 41:52.218
I'm outta here!

41:54.386 --> 41:56.096
Whoa!

41:58.224 --> 41:59.433
Come on, I wasn't gonna...

42:01.977 --> 42:03.854
Come on, let's get out of here.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.108
Speak.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.194
No, ma'am. He's not here either.

42:10.277 --> 42:13.364
- We got one more place to check.
- That better be the place then, Facundo.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.950
- Come on! Let's go!
- Right.

42:17.618 --> 42:20.412
You okay? You're making a mess.

43:06.792 --> 43:08.210
These are very good.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.213
You're not from around here, are you?

43:12.464 --> 43:13.340
No.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.426
- Like Europe or something?
- Mm.

43:17.469 --> 43:20.681
You don't have the same look
as people around here either.

43:22.224 --> 43:23.224
What's that?

43:23.642 --> 43:25.269
Resigned to a slow death.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.146
No future.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.105
No money.

43:30.316 --> 43:31.316
No work.

43:32.192 --> 43:35.362
Well, I'm not working anymore.
I'm retired.

43:37.197 --> 43:38.198
What was your job?

43:41.869 --> 43:43.537
I was in the funeral business.

43:45.539 --> 43:46.539
Where?

43:47.249 --> 43:48.542
Different places.

43:49.043 --> 43:50.210
Mostly overseas.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.129
A...

43:53.714 --> 43:55.716
A traveling funeral business?

43:56.258 --> 43:57.468
Yeah, well...

43:58.052 --> 44:02.222
Well, people die traveling
in foreign countries.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.766
- Americans.
- Hmm.

44:04.266 --> 44:06.602
I go over and I take care of it.

44:07.102 --> 44:08.102
Oh.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.606
How many countries have you been to?

44:11.106 --> 44:12.107
Ninety-nine.

44:12.983 --> 44:15.277
Most people don't even know 99 countries.

44:15.819 --> 44:16.820
Andorra.

44:17.404 --> 44:20.199
Albania. Austria. Australia.

44:20.699 --> 44:22.409
Antigua. Angola.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.870
Algeria. Afghanistan.

44:24.953 --> 44:25.953
Argentina.

44:26.622 --> 44:27.622
Azerbaijan.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.500
That was ten.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.919
And I'm only at the As, so, yeah.

44:33.545 --> 44:35.172
Do you speak any languages?

44:36.048 --> 44:37.048
Eight.

44:38.050 --> 44:40.511
You should give a class at school,
here in town.

44:41.387 --> 44:42.304
About what?

44:42.388 --> 44:43.889
Tell the kids about the world.

44:45.849 --> 44:48.310
How many teachers have actually
seen the places you have?

44:49.269 --> 44:50.269
Would you do it?

44:51.939 --> 44:52.939
No.

44:54.566 --> 44:55.566
Why not?

44:58.696 --> 45:00.656
I don't know how to talk to kids.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.201
Oh, right.

45:15.462 --> 45:17.548
- I'll rip your fucking arms off!
- Speak.

45:17.631 --> 45:21.093
Yeah, we're all out of luck here, too.
He ain't at this last location, either.

45:26.890 --> 45:30.978
- Go, girl! USA! USA!
- I'll rip your spindly fucking arms off!

45:31.770 --> 45:32.771
- What?
- One, two, three.

45:32.855 --> 45:34.455
Can you get it done already, goddamn it?

45:34.481 --> 45:35.774
- Four...
- Fuck!

45:35.858 --> 45:37.276
Sorry, I can't hear you.

45:37.359 --> 45:40.654
You better tell Hilde
her boyfriend is not gonna be happy

45:40.738 --> 45:42.614
if she doesn't find the Black Kaiser.

45:42.698 --> 45:45.325
Stop fighting.

45:45.409 --> 45:46.660
Stay still, Meatloaf.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.370
She's replaceable.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.581
You all are.

45:50.664 --> 45:52.332
Yeah, I can't remember all that.

45:52.416 --> 45:54.710
Better not call me again without a plan.

45:54.793 --> 45:56.879
I'm sorry, it's really noisy in here.
Can you repeat?

45:56.962 --> 45:59.131
Unless you have a serious death wish.

45:59.715 --> 46:00.715
Come on!

46:01.759 --> 46:02.760
One, two,

46:02.843 --> 46:04.070
- three, four...
- Hold him down!

46:04.094 --> 46:05.721
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

46:06.847 --> 46:07.681
Fuck!

46:07.765 --> 46:09.600
Fuck it.

46:09.725 --> 46:11.810
- Get out of the way.
- Come on!

46:18.901 --> 46:22.196
- Fucking hell!
- Oh, no, you killed him!

46:22.863 --> 46:24.364
Let's get the fuck out of here.

46:25.741 --> 46:27.576
Get back here, you fucking sacks of shit!

46:27.659 --> 46:29.495
- He's alive!
- I'll fucking kill you!

46:29.578 --> 46:31.458
Who the fuck do you think you are?

46:55.854 --> 46:58.023
All right, all right. One more time.

46:58.106 --> 46:59.441
Last time, okay?

47:00.901 --> 47:02.069
All right.

47:03.153 --> 47:06.198
The kukri is an arterial weapon.

47:07.574 --> 47:09.284
Perfect for slicing through flesh.

47:09.993 --> 47:11.495
But it sucks at...

47:11.578 --> 47:14.373
- Stabbing!
- There you go. Let's see what it can do.

47:15.582 --> 47:16.582
Here we go.

47:21.129 --> 47:22.256
And here. Boom!

47:24.550 --> 47:27.261
All right, all right, all right.

47:30.556 --> 47:31.723
Have a look at it.

47:32.307 --> 47:33.308
Pass it around.

47:34.142 --> 47:35.310
Good. Any questions?

47:39.898 --> 47:41.066
Let's start with you.

47:41.149 --> 47:43.151
How do they bury people in India?

47:55.163 --> 47:56.163
They burn 'em.

47:58.500 --> 48:02.004
And if the man dies first,
they'll burn the wife as well. Alive.

48:05.340 --> 48:08.093
- What clothes do they wear in Africa?
- Summer clothes.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.224
White. A lot of red.

48:16.351 --> 48:18.520
- Yeah?
- Do they eat turkey in Turkey?

48:20.105 --> 48:21.356
Very good, very good.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.984
No, chicken.

48:24.067 --> 48:25.319
And they put 'em on skewers.

48:28.405 --> 48:29.656
Right, last one.

48:30.282 --> 48:32.659
Do they speak American in England?

48:38.540 --> 48:39.791
They don't speak a lot.

48:43.003 --> 48:44.838
All right. Have any of you ever seen...

48:45.797 --> 48:48.258
a dead body that's been in the sun
for three weeks?

48:48.342 --> 48:49.551
No.

48:49.635 --> 48:51.386
Well, take a look at this, then.

48:52.888 --> 48:55.390
Here you go. Pay attention to his face.

48:56.016 --> 48:57.267
You can hardly see it anymore.

48:59.519 --> 49:00.604
Cool.

49:19.581 --> 49:20.832
How did it go?

49:21.917 --> 49:23.543
Pretty good, I think.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.177
They liked the knife.

49:33.261 --> 49:34.261
Oh.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.600
That was a pretty cool knife.

49:39.518 --> 49:40.518
I guess.

49:54.449 --> 49:55.492
Finally!

49:56.910 --> 49:58.704
That fucking accountant
was hiding something.

50:04.418 --> 50:08.088
Hey, what are you guys looking for?
You really think you're gonna find him?

50:08.171 --> 50:09.840
Shut up, Junkie Jane.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.635
You guys are so fucking boring.

50:14.052 --> 50:16.179
I said, shut up, Jane.

50:35.949 --> 50:37.909
- Hey there.
- I brought you something.

50:37.993 --> 50:38.827
Oh.

50:38.910 --> 50:40.078
Uh, thanks.

50:43.790 --> 50:45.751
You told me
how much you like knives, so...

50:47.461 --> 50:48.920
I thought this might be something.

50:51.298 --> 50:53.258
It comes in black if you like that better.

50:54.760 --> 50:55.760
I...

50:56.887 --> 51:00.599
- I don't know how to shoot. I...
- That's okay.

51:02.184 --> 51:03.268
I'm a teacher now.

51:04.394 --> 51:05.395
Remember?

51:09.483 --> 51:11.902
I would do anything for you,
my love.

51:11.985 --> 51:12.819
Anything.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.112
That's my girl.

51:14.196 --> 51:16.198
I miss you so much.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.283
I know, baby.

51:18.366 --> 51:20.827
Tell me again, what is it you plan to do?

51:21.369 --> 51:23.330
I will kill him for you.

51:23.413 --> 51:24.790
Oh, yeah!

51:25.457 --> 51:26.500
I love you.

51:29.544 --> 51:33.799
Shit! Imagine how much dope
you can get for 200,000.

51:33.882 --> 51:35.842
- Give me that.
- Can we cash this?

51:35.926 --> 51:37.766
What are you talking about?
Let me see.

51:40.806 --> 51:43.391
I got one more here
made out to some fucking charity shit.

51:44.142 --> 51:45.519
Awesome!

51:45.602 --> 51:47.479
Let's cash 'em all. We'll be rich.

51:47.562 --> 51:48.688
Shut up, Jane.

51:51.024 --> 51:52.025
A charity.

51:52.109 --> 51:53.401
I've got two more here.

51:53.902 --> 51:55.779
2005, 2009.

52:00.826 --> 52:04.454
Well, the charity is not what's important,

52:04.788 --> 52:06.289
it's the bank account.

52:06.373 --> 52:10.585
Fuck me. The Montana Union Credit Bank
in Triple Oak.

52:11.086 --> 52:12.462
The fuck is Triple Oak?

52:12.963 --> 52:15.257
Looks cold.
Why the fuck would he live there?

52:15.340 --> 52:17.180
- Why wouldn't he?
- No shit.

52:21.179 --> 52:22.681
Looks like we're on the move.

52:24.516 --> 52:27.477
Let's go.
We have a long drive ahead of us.

53:10.103 --> 53:11.897
All right. Here we go.

53:12.480 --> 53:13.732
Always two hands.

53:13.815 --> 53:16.985
One thumb there, one right there. Right?

53:20.780 --> 53:25.869
Then when you feel you have the target,
you squeeze the trigger nice and easy.

53:26.578 --> 53:27.954
Click. Got it?

53:32.834 --> 53:33.834
Now it's loaded.

53:34.252 --> 53:35.253
It's all yours.

53:36.004 --> 53:37.004
Two hands.

53:50.894 --> 53:51.894
That's it.

54:17.671 --> 54:18.671
It's okay.

54:19.547 --> 54:21.758
It's okay. We'll get you something else.

54:22.592 --> 54:23.843
I still have the receipt.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.273
I have never heard
about winter coffee before.

54:37.190 --> 54:38.190
No?

54:39.025 --> 54:41.820
I use bourbon and maple syrup.

54:52.247 --> 54:53.707
You really like animals, huh?

54:54.624 --> 54:55.667
Yes.

54:59.212 --> 55:00.422
I used to have a dog.

55:09.639 --> 55:11.308
We don't have to talk about it.

55:14.644 --> 55:16.479
I had this job when I was 13.

55:18.189 --> 55:19.316
I liked it a lot.

55:20.692 --> 55:22.694
I was Santa's helper at the library.

55:24.612 --> 55:25.612
And, uh...

55:27.449 --> 55:29.492
this one day,
it was just me and him there.

55:31.077 --> 55:33.079
He was more drunk than usual.

55:34.539 --> 55:35.874
He just came up to me.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.500
Hit me.

55:40.420 --> 55:41.420
Real hard.

55:44.049 --> 55:45.717
So hard, I landed on the floor.

55:47.844 --> 55:48.844
And then he...

55:56.895 --> 55:59.189
I always imagined what it would be like...

56:01.107 --> 56:02.107
to find him.

56:03.902 --> 56:04.902
Surprise him.

56:06.112 --> 56:07.781
I would have a gun in my hand.

56:09.407 --> 56:11.910
"Sit down," I would say.

56:14.788 --> 56:16.956
And then I would tell him
what he did to me.

56:18.416 --> 56:19.416
To my life.

56:21.586 --> 56:23.505
I guess I would tell him what he did.

56:24.714 --> 56:25.840
And he would listen.

56:29.594 --> 56:32.138
Tell him how that day
never left my thoughts.

56:34.349 --> 56:35.349
Never.

56:36.935 --> 56:37.935
And then...

56:39.270 --> 56:40.270
click.

56:42.482 --> 56:43.566
It would all go away.

56:45.944 --> 56:48.530
I would never have to see him again
when I close my eyes.

56:53.118 --> 56:54.244
It would all go away.

57:01.918 --> 57:04.421
Do you think it would be difficult
to kill someone?

57:17.058 --> 57:18.058
I don't know.

57:36.911 --> 57:38.591
Oh, hey there, Mr. Duncan!

57:38.621 --> 57:41.666
- How are you doing? What can I do you for?
- I'm looking for a gift.

57:41.749 --> 57:43.126
Well, you came to the right place.

57:43.710 --> 57:46.880
- It's for a girl.
- Oh! What kind of gift?

57:48.465 --> 57:49.465
Something normal.

57:56.222 --> 57:57.223
Shit, man.

57:59.559 --> 58:01.978
I got visuals on the target. Right there.

58:03.438 --> 58:04.438
Here we go.

58:05.106 --> 58:07.026
Sindy, he's coming your way.

58:38.890 --> 58:39.890
Hi.

58:40.558 --> 58:41.768
What's the problem?

58:43.311 --> 58:44.646
Do I look like a mechanic?

58:48.107 --> 58:49.107
Uh...

58:49.150 --> 58:50.902
I don't know. It just died.

58:52.028 --> 58:53.112
Did you call a tow truck?

58:53.530 --> 58:55.865
My phone's dead, too.

58:57.617 --> 58:59.369
Could I charge it in your car?

58:59.744 --> 59:00.745
Not in this car.

59:01.663 --> 59:02.830
Goddamn it!

59:03.456 --> 59:04.707
Well, um...

59:08.378 --> 59:09.796
Do you live far from here?

59:15.343 --> 59:16.703
Thanks for helping me out.

59:17.387 --> 59:18.555
You're welcome.

59:26.062 --> 59:27.062
Okay.

59:28.064 --> 59:29.065
Thanks.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.780
The soonest they can come out
is ten in the morning.

59:39.409 --> 59:41.244
Wow, look at that storm.

59:46.749 --> 59:47.749
You hungry?

59:48.251 --> 59:49.294
Mm-hmm.

01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:25.830
You get the couch.

01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:38.593
You're cute for an older guy.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:52.982
I said I'd never fuck anyone
older than my dad.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.571
Mm-hmm...

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:13.836
Oh, yeah!

01:02:16.649 --> 01:02:18.025
Goddamn, Sindy!

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:21.654
Take it easy on his old ass. You're gonna
kill him before I get a chance to.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.157
He'll die a lucky man.

01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:26.783
In position.

01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:31.748
- Let's take this fucker out.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.455
Take it away, Sindy.

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:47.388
It's blow time, mister.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.100
Ready?

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:52.977
- Yes, sir.
- Here we go.

01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:55.396
Consider yourself retired, motherfucker.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:58.357
All yours, Facundo.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:05.947
Bang.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.411
Fuck!

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:13.414
Fuck!

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.044
Sindy, talk to me.

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:20.296
By the bed, southwest corner!

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:28.262
- Where the hell is he?
- Under the bed!

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:30.264
Center.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:47.281
Fuck! I can't see him, can't see Sindy,
can't see shit.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.657
Shit.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:50.628
- Moving in.
- Breaching now.

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:58.542
Fuck!

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.254
"Fuck" what?

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:03.256
What's happening?

01:04:05.466 --> 01:04:06.634
He's not here.

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:08.803
Facundo?

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.097
- Find him.
- I'm on it.

01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:16.853
I got nothin'.

01:04:21.315 --> 01:04:22.859
Fuck!

01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:26.320
What the fuck was that?

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:27.405
Facundo?

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:28.947
You there?

01:04:31.909 --> 01:04:32.910
Facundo?

01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:34.996
Facundo, what the hell is going on?

01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:36.080
Did you hear that?

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:57.727
Fuck!

01:05:09.363 --> 01:05:10.740
Try not to be scared.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:12.408
Scared of what?

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.706
You make mistakes when you're afraid.

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:20.791
No mistakes. Not today.

01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:28.925
Alexei, activate plan B.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.637
I'm going to kill you.

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:34.639
Why?

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:38.225
Because that's what
I get paid to do, Duncan.

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:39.894
Who is paying you?

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:43.105
Does it fucking matter?

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:45.608
You'll be dead
before we leave here.

01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:49.236
Well, in that case, I guess
I wouldn't want you to leave, then.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:50.780
Yeah?

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:53.366
You can't always get what you want,
old man.

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:54.533
Goodbye.

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:12.385
- I need a name.
- Fuck you, you cunt!

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.428
A different name.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:17.765
Name.

01:06:17.848 --> 01:06:19.976
- No fuckin' names.
- Right.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.059
You know what this...

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:28.693
Did you hear that?

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:53.426
Try not to be scared.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:08.459
Alexei?

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:10.043
Did you get the girl?

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:16.801
What girl?

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:18.844
Who the fuck are you?

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:22.430
- What the fuck's going on, man?
- You tell me.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:23.515
What's going on?

01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:25.768
Alexei got a call.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.437
We was told to go
and fetch the girl and shit.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:30.272
What girl?

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.774
The girl the old man bought a gift for.

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:34.944
What the fuck do I know?

01:09:41.468 --> 01:09:44.013
Don't be sad.
You'll find a new girlfriend.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.892
Shouldn't be a problem
with your hot looks.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:52.395
I'm gonna cut him into pieces
and feed him to the rats!

01:09:55.065 --> 01:09:57.193
I told you not to fuck with him.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:10:00.321
I'm gonna chop his balls off
and shove them down his throat!

01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:05.451
What you should do
is pay Duncan his fuckin' pension

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.494
and enjoy the rest of your life.

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:08.829
No!

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.875
This is personal.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:15.878
Stealing his pension,

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.339
trying to kill him, twice,

01:10:18.422 --> 01:10:20.257
and kidnapping his cute little neighbor,

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.092
that is personal.

01:10:22.676 --> 01:10:23.802
I want him.

01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:26.680
I'm sick of giving you advice.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:28.098
I'm not asking for advice!

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:30.976
I'm giving you a fucking order!

01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:37.149
- Are you done?
- No!

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:26.365
To hell with you guys.

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:29.118
Give it up for our own
king of the road, Porter.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:30.995
Next up, Larry.

01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:33.998
What are you drinking?

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:36.166
I don't have time, Porter.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:39.545
Oh, you got time to have a drink
with a dying man.

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:43.090
One for me
and one for my friend here.

01:11:46.593 --> 01:11:47.593
Cheers.

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:55.393
So.

01:11:55.894 --> 01:11:57.271
They did try to kill you.

01:11:58.188 --> 01:11:59.188
Twice.

01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:03.027
Once in Belarus and once at my place.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:07.865
You know,
I had the worst winter of my life...

01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:10.284
one summer in Belarus.

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:11.952
What's going on, Porter?

01:12:12.786 --> 01:12:14.455
We're getting too old.

01:12:15.539 --> 01:12:17.041
And that's what's going on.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:24.465
Somewhere in your contract
is a bunch of words

01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:27.301
that says if you die before retirement,

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.929
all the money goes back to the company,

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.557
unless you've named a next of kin,

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.101
and who in our business

01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:39.730
has a next of kin?

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.358
And you are costing the company...

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.361
a shitload of money.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.072
How much they owe you? Three?

01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:49.989
Four?

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:51.950
Eight.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:55.746
You trust Vivian?

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:57.289
No.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.374
D'you fuck her?

01:13:00.667 --> 01:13:01.667
I did.

01:13:02.252 --> 01:13:03.087
Ugh.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.800
Okay. Do you know
where they would keep the girl?

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:14.264
Your guess is as good as mine,
but, uh, she's probably in the mansion.

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:16.016
It's got lots of rooms.

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:19.686
Enough for all of his perverted stunts.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.647
I've only been in that building once.

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:26.985
I had to shake
that disgusting creature's hand.

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:28.612
Thanks, Porter.

01:13:28.695 --> 01:13:30.906
And I... I want to tell you something.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:35.661
You were just too good, you know.

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:37.287
Is that it?

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.707
Take it for what it's worth.

01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:43.460
Be careful, Duncan.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:59.226
And down he goes.

01:13:59.643 --> 01:14:01.478
Fuckin' drunk.

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:04.565
Speak.

01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:05.816
It's done.

01:14:05.899 --> 01:14:07.192
Well done, Porter.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:10.154
Send someone over, clean this place up.

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:11.821
You got it.

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:01.872
You hurt me, Mr. Vizla.

01:15:03.123 --> 01:15:09.213
And that cannot be repaid
with a swift, impersonal death.

01:15:23.435 --> 01:15:24.436
Hmm.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:29.483
When the English caught
the traitor William Wallace...

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:34.112
they dragged him naked
through the streets for six miles

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:39.701
so that peasants could smear
their warm, fresh piss and shit on him.

01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:46.458
Then the executioner cut off
his cock and balls,

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.545
cooked them over a fire,

01:15:49.836 --> 01:15:51.880
and then served them for him to eat.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:57.135
He slit his guts right open, huh,
and pulled them out.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:16:01.848
He could literally see and smell
his own intestines.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.060
And so it went on,

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:09.106
because the traitor had hurt the king.

01:16:11.775 --> 01:16:14.903
I guess Wallace hurt England pretty bad.

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:22.661
You hurt me pretty bad, Mr. Vizla.

01:16:24.955 --> 01:16:28.875
I have four days
before I have to kill you.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:33.213
Four days of hell!

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.882
And on your birthday...

01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:38.134
you die.

01:16:54.818 --> 01:16:56.570
I'm gonna have a little fun...

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.072
with your lady.

01:16:59.656 --> 01:17:00.866
And you're gonna watch.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:09.499
So I've given it some thought,

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:13.378
and I've decided
that we're gonna start...

01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:16.088
with these.

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:18.008
Huh?

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:20.927
Music, please.

01:17:29.436 --> 01:17:30.687
Fuck!

01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:38.820
Sorry, did that hurt?

01:17:44.701 --> 01:17:47.663
The fun continues tomorrow,
Mr. Vizla.

01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:00.801
There you go, honey.

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:24.408
Music, please.

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:41.799
Hah!

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:45.887
The fun continues tomorrow, Mr. Vizla.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:18.336
Well, I can't just do one side
and not the other.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.884
Easy now, honey.

01:19:35.395 --> 01:19:37.272
You broke my favorite knife.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.360
I said, you've broken my favorite...

01:19:43.361 --> 01:19:44.404
Hello?

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:46.030
Hello?

01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:53.580
I'm obviously not getting through to you,
am I?

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:08.762
The fun continues tomorrow, Mr. Vizla.

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:36.832
Wake up...

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.280
What the fuck?

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.131
Well, don't just stand there. Kill him!

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:47.354
Oh, shit!

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:50.608
Fuck!

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:56.281
Go, go, go!

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:14.174
He's coming. Get him!

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:39.345
Who the fuck are you?

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.464
No. I need your phone, Jazmin.

01:27:42.465 --> 01:27:43.549
Duncan?

01:27:43.633 --> 01:27:44.801
- Is that you?
- Phone.

01:27:46.219 --> 01:27:48.099
- Jesus. What the fuck happened to you?
- Phone!

01:27:48.137 --> 01:27:49.555
Here, here, take the phone.

01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:01.234
Quiet.
Try and keep him on the line.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.029
Speak.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:06.739
I'll make you a trade.

01:28:08.032 --> 01:28:09.158
Me for the girl.

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:13.496
You hear? You hear me?

01:28:13.913 --> 01:28:15.039
I heard you.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:16.332
I'll call you back.

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.128
Whoa. I got you.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:24.716
- Please, tell me you got him.
- No, no luck. Not long enough.

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.509
We have to keep him on the line longer.

01:28:26.592 --> 01:28:27.593
What did he say?

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:29.095
He wants a trade.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:30.847
A trade?

01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:33.433
- His life for the girl's.
- The girl?

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:37.312
- Is she even worth it?
- Not when I'm done with her.

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.259
Because when I'm done with them,

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:42.066
they're both going to be fucking dead!

01:28:48.698 --> 01:28:49.907
How many men do you have left?

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:53.327
Enough.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:11.072
Up, up, up. Let's go.

01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:12.365
Up.

01:30:14.992 --> 01:30:17.745
You're not going anywhere soon
with all that shit in your system.

01:30:21.707 --> 01:30:23.459
Hey, stop, stop, stop.

01:30:27.046 --> 01:30:28.089
This should help.

01:30:30.383 --> 01:30:31.383
Okay, just lie down.

01:30:34.554 --> 01:30:35.596
There you go.

01:30:36.848 --> 01:30:37.849
Yeah.

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:52.155
Okay, Duncan.
How can I help you? What do you need?

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:53.238
An army.

01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:57.034
Okay, here we go. You'll need all of it.

01:30:57.118 --> 01:30:59.745
- It's like a full package.
- Okay.

01:31:00.872 --> 01:31:01.956
Here, try these on.

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:26.272
I always knew you'd come back.

01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:29.650
I was just hoping it'd be for me,
not the guns.

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:51.380
Okay, ready.

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:53.716
Be quiet!

01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:55.426
Speak.

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:56.552
Is she alive?

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:57.636
Yes.

01:31:57.887 --> 01:31:59.180
She'll be ready, Duncan.

01:31:59.639 --> 01:32:00.639
Stand by.

01:32:01.432 --> 01:32:03.684
- Did we trace that?
- We're working on it.

01:32:03.768 --> 01:32:06.145
We have his general vicinity,
but we need another call.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:08.731
Let's get on the move.

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:10.941
I'm on it.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.277
He'll call back.

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:15.005
- You'd better be right.
- I'm always right.

01:32:15.029 --> 01:32:16.447
Let's go!

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:23.763
Speak.

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.309
- What's the deal?
- Me for the girl.

01:33:26.809 --> 01:33:29.437
- An even trade.
- I know. You already said that.

01:33:30.563 --> 01:33:32.565
Where and when?

01:33:32.648 --> 01:33:35.401
Central Train Station, nine a.m. tomorrow.

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.862
Why the fuck are you doing this?

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:39.822
I don't know. I like her.

01:33:40.406 --> 01:33:41.490
You like her?

01:33:42.491 --> 01:33:43.826
Why are you doing this?

01:33:43.909 --> 01:33:44.952
Please.

01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:46.871
This is our fucking job, remember?

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:50.833
You used to have one and be good at it.

01:33:52.084 --> 01:33:53.204
Nine a.m. tomorrow.

01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:55.212
You, me, and Camille.

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:56.839
That's it. No one else.

01:33:56.922 --> 01:33:59.675
Jesus! It has a name.
And you remembered it.

01:34:00.259 --> 01:34:03.679
And you have a face I won't forget.
You better not pull a fast one tomorrow.

01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:08.017
Unless you want to hide
for the rest of your life, Vivian.

01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:12.855
I'm afraid it's a bit too late
for that now.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:19.070
And to think, you've been
hiding out just around the corner.

01:34:25.117 --> 01:34:26.243
Here we are.

01:34:29.705 --> 01:34:31.040
Happy to see me?

01:34:31.123 --> 01:34:32.333
Not really.

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:37.213
I like the eye patch. Very fancy.

01:34:37.296 --> 01:34:39.507
And you look extraordinary, as always.

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:50.017
Time to die, Herr Black Kaiser.

01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:51.769
Nowhere to run this time.

01:34:52.937 --> 01:34:55.606
- Thought you stopped smoking.
- Yeah.

01:34:56.899 --> 01:34:58.317
Figured it wouldn't kill me.

01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:00.610
Hm.

01:35:03.614 --> 01:35:04.990
Was I on the phone too long?

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:06.992
Forty-seven seconds.

01:35:07.827 --> 01:35:09.745
Guess we do get rusty when we turn 50.

01:35:10.287 --> 01:35:12.081
Yeah, it's sad.

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:14.417
I know they pay you well for this, Vivian.

01:35:15.751 --> 01:35:18.546
But I'm still gonna give you a chance
to walk out of here alive.

01:35:19.588 --> 01:35:20.673
For old times' sake.

01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:23.843
You've become sentimental.

01:35:25.428 --> 01:35:27.346
Me for the girl. An even trade.

01:35:28.264 --> 01:35:32.393
You keep saying that,
but you don't have anything to trade with.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.145
You are at a dead end.

01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:38.274
The road that you have chosen
doesn't have a rainbow.

01:35:39.442 --> 01:35:40.442
No.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.570
No rainbows.

01:35:45.489 --> 01:35:46.991
You grew soft, Duncan.

01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:49.951
Your bad.

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:42.713
Oh, shit!

01:37:00.731 --> 01:37:02.775
Shit!

01:37:11.909 --> 01:37:13.077
Duncan...

01:37:14.119 --> 01:37:15.119
Duncan...

01:37:21.377 --> 01:37:22.377
Guards?

01:37:28.884 --> 01:37:29.884
Guards!

01:37:45.150 --> 01:37:46.150
You know what?

01:37:47.069 --> 01:37:48.069
Let him come.

01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:50.614
I'm gonna fuck him up.

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:52.783
Yeah.

01:37:52.908 --> 01:37:54.410
I'm gonna fuck him up!

01:37:54.493 --> 01:37:56.745
Yes, come here, you fucking fuck!

01:37:56.829 --> 01:37:57.830
Mr. Blut?

01:37:58.330 --> 01:37:59.373
Look.

01:38:05.838 --> 01:38:07.381
Oh, shit.

01:38:19.602 --> 01:38:21.122
Let's get the fuck outta here!

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.147
Go, go, go! Move!

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:24.731
Don't you fucking dare!

01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.567
Hey, you fucking pussies!

01:38:30.529 --> 01:38:31.529
Oh, dear!

01:38:32.573 --> 01:38:33.573
Come back!

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:41.832
Excuse us.

01:38:41.916 --> 01:38:43.000
He's upstairs.

01:38:50.883 --> 01:38:52.092
Go, go, go! Move!

01:38:59.558 --> 01:39:00.726
Hello, there.

01:39:00.851 --> 01:39:02.269
Is Mr. Blut expecting you, sir?

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:06.774
I'll fetch you a cup of coffee, sir.

01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:09.363
- Bring me the girl.
- No.

01:39:09.401 --> 01:39:10.736
Bring me the fucking girl!

01:39:10.819 --> 01:39:12.363
No fuckin' way. You're on your own.

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:14.573
What do you mean you won't... Hello?

01:39:14.657 --> 01:39:15.657
Hello?

01:39:58.367 --> 01:39:59.618
Done already, sir?

01:40:00.119 --> 01:40:01.119
Yes.

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:02.370
Oh.

01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:04.247
Mr. Blut?

01:40:04.957 --> 01:40:05.957
Oh, dear.

01:42:27.349 --> 01:42:28.684
I always wonder...

01:42:28.767 --> 01:42:30.519
...be to find him.

01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:34.106
...and tell him what he did.

01:42:36.066 --> 01:42:38.318
Do you think it would be difficult
to kill someone?

01:42:38.443 --> 01:42:41.238
Will you be making
the same charity donation?

01:42:55.794 --> 01:42:58.380
I can see you.

01:43:13.604 --> 01:43:15.189
I only see you.

01:43:22.863 --> 01:43:25.532
You are always the only one I see.

01:43:30.245 --> 01:43:32.039
Sit down.

01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:42.466
Everyone else is there
when I close my eyes.

01:43:44.301 --> 01:43:45.677
But I can't see them.

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:48.263
I can feel them.

01:43:50.015 --> 01:43:52.309
I feel my brother's soft cheek
on my shoulder.

01:43:53.227 --> 01:43:54.227
His hair...

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.647
His hair smelled of little boy.

01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:58.065
I loved him.

01:44:00.275 --> 01:44:03.654
I can feel my mother's warm hand
wrapped around mine.

01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:06.239
Always warm.

01:44:07.282 --> 01:44:11.245
All of her is warm because she's
about to have my baby sister.

01:44:14.456 --> 01:44:16.917
I can smell the cigarette
my father just put out.

01:44:18.293 --> 01:44:20.295
He smelled of cigarettes and aftershave.

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:22.089
I liked it a lot.

01:44:24.466 --> 01:44:25.926
I can feel them.

01:44:26.343 --> 01:44:27.678
But I can't see them.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:30.680
Only you.

01:44:32.891 --> 01:44:34.268
Always you.

01:44:36.561 --> 01:44:37.561
Why?

01:44:38.897 --> 01:44:40.524
Why didn't you just shoot me?

01:44:43.819 --> 01:44:45.320
It was not supposed to happen.

01:44:46.321 --> 01:44:47.321
It was a mistake.

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:52.661
- I was given the wrong information...
- Don't talk.

01:44:53.328 --> 01:44:55.789
Just... don't talk.

01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:04.089
Every day,
I pray that I'd died that night.

01:45:05.966 --> 01:45:07.342
Do you understand?

01:45:10.762 --> 01:45:13.181
No, do you understand?

01:45:16.518 --> 01:45:17.728
I'm sorry.

01:45:21.231 --> 01:45:23.817
Yeah, I didn't learn about it
until I turned 21.

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.029
Someone paid for my school.

01:45:28.071 --> 01:45:30.991
Someone was asking for salvation.

01:45:32.576 --> 01:45:35.370
I thought, "Follow the money,"
as they say.

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:38.457
It wasn't as hard as I thought.

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:41.335
It just took me a while to go there.

01:45:43.045 --> 01:45:44.254
Too afraid, I guess.

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:48.800
I thought that if I saw you,

01:45:49.468 --> 01:45:52.804
I might get my family back
when I closed my eyes.

01:45:54.222 --> 01:45:55.515
But that didn't happen.

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:58.393
I didn't move on.

01:46:00.312 --> 01:46:01.480
I can't!

01:46:04.733 --> 01:46:06.318
Do you understand?

01:46:08.612 --> 01:46:09.612
Yeah.

01:46:10.322 --> 01:46:13.283
You didn't recognize me
when we met at the store?

01:46:14.451 --> 01:46:15.952
You know, the first time we met?

01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:18.914
Were you not curious?

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:24.252
You paid all this money and you didn't
even know what I looked like?

01:46:25.128 --> 01:46:26.296
Who I was?

01:46:31.176 --> 01:46:32.803
I didn't want to disturb you.

01:46:34.596 --> 01:46:36.139
Interfere with your life.

01:46:37.349 --> 01:46:41.019
Well, but you have... interfered.

01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:46.316
I don't want to see you anymore.

01:46:46.942 --> 01:46:49.945
I want you to go away.

01:46:50.862 --> 01:46:52.531
And I want them to come back.

01:46:54.032 --> 01:46:55.032
Understand?

01:47:02.624 --> 01:47:03.624
Close your mind...

01:47:05.043 --> 01:47:06.169
and pull the trigger.

01:47:11.466 --> 01:47:12.466
It's okay.

01:47:41.079 --> 01:47:43.039
Do you know who wanted my father dead?

01:47:46.543 --> 01:47:47.543
No.

01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:50.881
Well, can we find out?

01:47:54.176 --> 01:47:55.218
We can try.
