00:26.997 --> 00:28.902
Hello-lable!

00:29.164 --> 00:32.037
Cuber?
Blable brother?

00:32.141 --> 00:34.031
Where are you?

00:38.831 --> 00:44.985
Oh, this cave air is doing
wonders for my physiological

00:45.062 --> 00:48.902
bable, bable,
bable, bable, bable.

00:49.277 --> 00:52.255
Oh! Aah!

00:53.412 --> 00:54.686
Oh!

00:55.467 --> 00:58.023
But I'm a baby!

00:58.127 --> 01:00.452
Tuber?
Sister Tuber?

01:00.529 --> 01:02.792
Bable, bable, bable.

01:08.678 --> 01:10.106
Aah!

01:11.097 --> 01:12.639
Hmm? Aah!

01:12.719 --> 01:19.090
Oh, you surprised your old pal,
Cuber, aboard his spaceship.

01:19.438 --> 01:21.553
Oh, this old Grayble?

01:21.630 --> 01:25.285
It's just
sentimental blabling.

01:25.651 --> 01:30.284
You know, the present can be far
more interesting than the past.

01:30.361 --> 01:31.496
Let's see.

01:31.576 --> 01:34.645
Oh! It's a
space wedding!

01:34.722 --> 01:37.180
Let's go in for
a closer look.

01:37.257 --> 01:39.108
Easy.

Wable.

01:56.139 --> 01:58.422
Bable, bable.

01:58.755 --> 02:01.676
Bable, bable, bable.

02:18.621 --> 02:20.654
Oh! Survival!

02:20.731 --> 02:22.612
Remember your training.

02:23.252 --> 02:25.362
Trust your Graybles.

02:25.439 --> 02:27.619
Oh, and you
children at home,

02:27.696 --> 02:30.624
don't bother trying to
guess tonight's theme.

02:30.701 --> 02:32.658
Applesauce to a theme!

02:32.735 --> 02:36.185
Your friend Cuber
doesn't want to die!

02:42.150 --> 02:44.234
Oh, come on.

02:45.919 --> 02:47.788
It's Finn.
Hey, Finn!

02:47.865 --> 02:48.937
I'm a Weather Vane!

02:49.014 --> 02:52.611
Hey, Finn!
I'm a Weather Vane!

02:52.688 --> 02:55.277
Hey, Finn!
I'm a cliff diver!

02:55.354 --> 02:56.502
What?!

02:57.297 --> 02:58.344
Ohh!

02:58.566 --> 03:00.467
BMO, you got to let
me dig this hole.

03:00.544 --> 03:02.406
- It's important.
- A hole, you say?

03:02.483 --> 03:03.444
Yeah.

03:03.521 --> 03:05.116
We beat this
evil wizard, see,

03:05.193 --> 03:06.558
and we stole
his giant wand.

03:06.635 --> 03:08.276
Don't listen
to him, BMO.

03:08.353 --> 03:11.147
I beat the Wizard,
so I'm making Finn dig the hole,

03:11.224 --> 03:13.218
even though I could do
it in like two seconds.

03:13.295 --> 03:14.886
Heh, heh, heh.

03:14.963 --> 03:16.023
Rude!

03:16.100 --> 03:18.248
This wand is crazy
powerful, right?

03:18.325 --> 03:19.493
It's a Thought Cannon.

03:19.570 --> 03:22.115
It makes anything that
you think of turn real.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.133
Up, Please.

03:24.228 --> 03:26.285
So it's too strong, so
we're burying it for safety.

03:26.362 --> 03:27.605
I'll tell you what I'd do.

03:27.682 --> 03:30.046
I'd use that Cannon
and imagine a hole.

03:30.123 --> 03:33.491
Jake, remember what they say
about absolutely power.

03:33.568 --> 03:35.915
I'm tired of
your wisdom, BMO!

03:36.861 --> 03:38.641
Now watch and learn!

03:39.013 --> 03:41.520
Yeah, okay, my name's Jake,
and I'm gonna take this magic

03:41.597 --> 03:43.082
Thought Cannon,
and I'm gonna think,

03:43.159 --> 03:45.156
"I want a hole to bury
this Thought Cannon in,"

03:45.233 --> 03:49.343
and bobble, bobble, Jake gets a hole in
which a Thought Cannon may be buried!

03:49.438 --> 03:51.695
What if for a split second
you think of something else?

03:51.772 --> 03:54.236
Nope,
my brain's my hands!

03:59.331 --> 04:00.398
Whoops!

04:00.537 --> 04:02.715
Looks like I was thinking
about a sandwich.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.510
Enjoy your labor!

04:05.587 --> 04:07.412
Heh, heh, heh.

04:09.191 --> 04:11.091
I used to
wish I was you.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.661
Now I just wish you
would dig faster.

04:23.924 --> 04:26.317
What's this, friends?

04:26.513 --> 04:30.265
Could it be the aformabled
Thought Cannon?

04:30.585 --> 04:33.891
"Bobble, bobble"
as the dead might say.

04:33.968 --> 04:36.717
That's the
power of Graybles.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.575
I guess here
goes bable.

04:49.337 --> 04:51.774
You try <i>not</i> to
think of a sandwich,

04:51.851 --> 04:53.411
and look what happens!

04:53.488 --> 04:55.206
A sandwich!

04:59.032 --> 05:00.784
Ow!

05:00.865 --> 05:02.621
Mama's milk!
Oh, my mama's milk!

05:02.698 --> 05:04.797
Oh, that milk!

05:04.874 --> 05:06.855
Graybles!

05:15.102 --> 05:17.056
<i>"I will marry you, Ice King.</i>

05:17.133 --> 05:19.443
<i>I</i> will <i>marry you,
Ice King.</i>

05:19.520 --> 05:21.507
<i>I</i> will <i>marry you...</i>

05:24.606 --> 05:27.328
Good morning, madness.

05:27.894 --> 05:31.352
What?!
Broken leg again!

05:32.089 --> 05:33.332
And...

05:33.409 --> 05:36.537
Hup! Hello!
How are you?!

05:36.975 --> 05:38.247
Oh!

05:38.492 --> 05:41.789
Gunther, did you
see how this happened?

05:44.507 --> 05:47.715
I love you, Gunther,
but I'm onto your business.

05:49.202 --> 05:51.963
Hmm,
just like that, huh?

05:52.040 --> 05:53.332
And...

05:53.409 --> 05:54.546
hup!

06:01.257 --> 06:03.894
You can do it, Cuber.

06:11.903 --> 06:14.310
You can do it, Cuber.

06:14.387 --> 06:16.542
You can run away.

06:21.676 --> 06:25.352
Friend or foe,
I doble know.

06:28.968 --> 06:30.389
Now what?

06:30.500 --> 06:33.081
Maybe Grayble.

06:39.313 --> 06:42.767
I see that Mr. Cupcake is at
Madam Ecclair's apartment again.

06:42.844 --> 06:45.842
His massage business
is <i>really</i> taking off.

06:46.028 --> 06:47.231
Hmm.

06:51.027 --> 06:52.032
Starchy?

06:52.109 --> 06:55.844
- Yes, sir.
- Starchy is just going for a walk.

06:58.944 --> 07:01.604
Ooh! A grass lard!

07:02.017 --> 07:04.949
Oh, look, wildflowers!

07:05.549 --> 07:06.897
Psst, psst!

07:06.974 --> 07:08.237
Hey!

07:13.981 --> 07:17.930
Well, I'm just gonna
pick these flowers now.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.857
No holes.

07:26.607 --> 07:28.738
Yeah, in the ear.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.607
Oh, I mean,
in the <i>rear.</i>

07:30.684 --> 07:32.770
That's what all the
walking's good for...

07:32.847 --> 07:36.032
Gives me self-esteem
to have a nice rear.

07:36.109 --> 07:37.198
Aah! Oh!

07:37.315 --> 07:38.598
No! Agh!

07:39.310 --> 07:41.293
Mercy from the wet eyes!

07:41.370 --> 07:43.842
Whoa!

07:45.910 --> 07:47.346
Unh!

07:49.817 --> 07:51.421
Starchy?!

07:51.639 --> 07:53.822
Did Starchy just die?

07:54.409 --> 07:55.577
Hey, hey!

07:58.606 --> 08:00.684
Things looking up.

08:04.851 --> 08:06.231
Mm.

08:14.876 --> 08:17.526
Thank you.

08:23.256 --> 08:26.542
S.O.S....
Save Our Skin.

08:33.174 --> 08:34.947
Aah!

08:36.004 --> 08:38.674
<i>Welcome home, Starchy.</i>

08:41.746 --> 08:44.193
Never mind!

09:13.498 --> 09:16.308
Oh, what time is it?

09:16.976 --> 09:19.294
Oh! Grayble!

09:33.266 --> 09:36.530
Well, one Grayble left.

09:43.691 --> 09:45.554
Aah!

09:48.169 --> 09:49.696
Tuber!

09:49.773 --> 09:52.911
Self-actualization,
Lable brother.

09:58.943 --> 10:03.746
You can be a hero, Cuber,
and what a cube can be must be.

10:07.369 --> 10:10.423
Speaking in alien language...

10:10.491 --> 10:12.686
I'm a hero!

10:12.763 --> 10:14.948
Cuber first!

10:32.771 --> 10:35.617
Now, wasn't
<i>that</i> a thing!

10:35.694 --> 10:38.071
We've had
laffs and gaffs,

10:38.148 --> 10:40.006
thribbles and chibbles,

10:40.083 --> 10:43.748
some close calls,
secrets and questions,

10:43.825 --> 10:46.905
and memories to share.

10:46.982 --> 10:50.369
We barely made it
out with our scaybles...

10:50.446 --> 10:54.363
all thanks to Graybles.

10:57.396 --> 10:59.346
Sister Tuber?

10:59.423 --> 11:01.807
I'm sorry for this mess.

11:01.884 --> 11:03.490
I love you.

11:03.567 --> 11:04.649
Psh!
